# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Look, the goal here is simple: we want this to be a welcoming and safe space for everyone. We're committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, nationality, race, religion, or sexual identity.

Basically, we want to build a cool thing together, and to do that, everyone needs to feel respected.

## Our Standards

Hereâ€™s a general idea of the kind of behavior that helps create a positive environment:

*   **Be kind and empathetic.** It's the golden rule.
*   **Respect different opinions and experiences.** We're not all going to agree on everything, and that's okay.
*   **Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.** We're all here to learn and improve.
*   **Own your mistakes.** If you mess up, apologize and learn from it. We've all been there.
*   **Focus on what's best for the community.**

And here's the stuff that's not okay:

*   **Sexualized language or imagery,** and any kind of unwanted sexual attention.
*   **Trolling, insulting comments, and personal or political attacks.** Keep it focused on the project.
*   **Public or private harassment.** Just don't.
*   **Publishing others' private information** (like a physical or email address) without their permission. This is a huge breach of trust.
*   **Any other conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.**

## Enforcement

The project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. If someone's behavior is out of line, we'll take fair and appropriate action. We have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere in the project's community spaces (GitHub, etc.). It also applies when you're officially representing the community in public spaces, like using an official email or acting as a representative at an event.

## Reporting Issues

If you see or experience any abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers at **[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and we'll respect the privacy and security of the person reporting the incident.

## What Happens if Someone Breaks the Rules?

We'll follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for any action we deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Using inappropriate language or other behavior that's unprofessional or unwelcome.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from the maintainers, explaining why the behavior was inappropriate. We might ask for a public apology.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or a series of actions.
**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. This might mean no interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction with the community for a set period. Breaking the ban leads to a permanent one.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
