[00:00.000 --> 00:05.960]  At Chipotle, we also have a playlist. Guacamole as it's being hand-mashed. The sizzle of adobo
[00:05.960 --> 00:11.220]  chicken on the grill. The chopping of onions and cilantro. We call our playlist, Real.
[00:11.860 --> 00:14.380]  Order now. Chipotle. For Real.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.020]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 66.
[00:21.680 --> 00:25.080]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Patton, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz,
[00:25.080 --> 00:30.260]  Eric Baddour. Hello, boys. Hello. All right, a couple orders of business. One,
[00:30.340 --> 00:34.020]  I have two questions that are very important that I ask you guys this week that keep getting pushed.
[00:34.460 --> 00:40.080]  Also, we have about seven draft ideas we need to go over and make sure we're all on the same page
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.940]  about so we can schedule those. And we should probably mention that the Gerbler launch happened.
[00:46.860 --> 00:52.600]  Yes. And it was, I think, we can say, a success. Absolutely.
[00:52.600 --> 01:00.460]  It was 10,000 in 12 hours. Is that right? Yeah. Which means people had essentially a waking day
[01:00.460 --> 01:07.560]  to log in at their leisure and get a Gerbler or two. What if next time, 11,000?
[01:09.340 --> 01:14.080]  What if next time 9,000? Why? Oh, I'm just kind of given like, you know,
[01:14.140 --> 01:16.540]  six and one half dozen. I'm kind of going just like the other way to see.
[01:16.860 --> 01:20.260]  All right. I'll meet you guys in the middle of 10k. All right. Hey, I think that's good.
[01:21.340 --> 01:24.820]  No, I think we learned a lot, though. We're definitely going to increase the Kuesler
[01:25.220 --> 01:30.080]  output when we make more of those. We need to increase the combo patch deal when we do that.
[01:30.180 --> 01:35.720]  We definitely need more patch shirts. We got a lot of really good, interesting information from
[01:35.720 --> 01:41.140]  the sale. And I think we are getting really close to being dialed in on the amount of Gerblers.
[01:41.740 --> 01:46.320]  People have asked in the comments if we were going to be re-releasing this Gerbler.
[01:47.020 --> 01:51.520]  Like most Gerblers, no plans to do that. We already began work on a new Gerbler
[01:51.520 --> 01:57.460]  that should be out later in the year, and it'll be different. It'll be new and a different idea.
[01:57.780 --> 02:01.860]  Most of all, from the merch drop, thank you so much to everybody who showed up and supported us.
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.200]  Absolutely. We appreciate it so much.
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.280]  Continue to be blown away by your support. Just happy that we also didn't frustrate you
[02:09.280 --> 02:13.120]  and annoy you by selling out too fast this time. Especially everyone who made it for the stream,
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.280]  for the actual drop. Yeah, that was really cool.
[02:16.800 --> 02:24.980]  2v2 Mario Party, I love. What a fun, different way to play that game. I love watching that.
[02:25.260 --> 02:29.520]  As a member of the only undefeated 2v2 Mario team, I'm going to agree with you.
[02:30.580 --> 02:31.520]  Good old Team G.
[02:32.060 --> 02:35.600]  Team G. Classic Team G, baby.
[02:37.700 --> 02:41.640]  Oh, Christ. Does anybody else have anything they want to talk about this week? Any orders of
[02:41.640 --> 02:44.900]  business? Well, I think we need to get to your questions. You said that they keep getting pushed.
[02:45.160 --> 02:49.600]  Let's go right into your questions. Hopefully these will inspire a little bit of conversation.
[02:49.720 --> 02:52.900]  The first question I have, I thought about this the other couple weeks ago.
[02:53.560 --> 03:00.940]  What is your favorite color to drink? And it can't be clear. Because of Gavin.
[03:01.820 --> 03:09.060]  Oh, I see. I'm trying to think here. Immediately what comes to mind is orange.
[03:09.820 --> 03:12.820]  Okay. I enjoy orange drinks, generally.
[03:13.660 --> 03:17.960]  What about though, because I like apple drinks quite a bit. I'm trying to weigh if I like orange
[03:17.960 --> 03:25.300]  more than apple drinks. You ever get surprised by a drink? Oh, all the time. I feel like most drinks
[03:25.300 --> 03:30.480]  that look like piss are actually quite good. Yeah. Yeah. Like pineapple looks like piss,
[03:30.540 --> 03:34.100]  but it tastes delicious. Yeah. And like apple juice often looks pretty pissy.
[03:34.100 --> 03:40.980]  Hmm. What color would you say coffee is? Are we calling it brown? Brown. Okay. That's my answer.
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.260]  I would say coffee, tea, and sodas all fall in the brown category.
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.140]  Yeah. You get Coke, you get root beer. Yeah. I think if I can't pick clear, I'm going to say
[03:50.140 --> 03:56.960]  white. What's white? Milk? What's white? Milk? No, like maybe like an electrolyte drink of some
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.320]  sort. Oh, like a white Gatorade. Yeah. Those are pretty good. Yeah. Like a glacier ice or something.
[04:02.320 --> 04:06.800]  You get glacier ice and milk. Those are your two choices. What a one-two.
[04:08.940 --> 04:13.400]  I only, I only use milk. I never just go for a glass of milk, you know?
[04:13.860 --> 04:18.700]  Sure. I think that's fair. I'm surprised. I figured, I expected, I mean, I kind of
[04:18.700 --> 04:22.580]  had an idea that Gavin would immediately try to say clear and Eric would say brown,
[04:22.760 --> 04:27.180]  but I'm surprised red didn't come up. That seems to be like the go-to for most people. I've been
[04:27.180 --> 04:31.520]  polling people in my life and almost everybody has said red. Yeah. Red can swing in a lot of
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.800]  different ways. You're either getting cherry or like a strawberry. And there's a lot of variation
[04:36.360 --> 04:41.600]  in fake cherry. Cherry is good. Strawberry is good. Watermelon is good. Fruit punch is just
[04:41.600 --> 04:47.100]  a combination of those and is good. I definitely don't ever pick up red and go like, oh, what
[04:47.100 --> 04:54.920]  about blue Razz? Oh, well, I haven't gone yet, but my answer is blue. I think, I think blue is
[04:54.920 --> 05:00.440]  my favorite color to drink. Yeah. There's just not a lot of blue drinks that immediately come to mind
[05:00.440 --> 05:07.340]  to me. There's like three different blue Gatorades and Powerades that I absolutely love. Okay. There's
[05:07.340 --> 05:13.980]  blue Razz. Is there any new high voltage? There you go. Is there any fruit that produces a naturally
[05:13.980 --> 05:20.900]  blue juice? Oh. Because blue might be the most unnatural liquid color to drink. I mean, even
[05:20.900 --> 05:24.980]  though everything's dye anyway, it's just like, what's blue? I feel like we talked about this.
[05:25.100 --> 05:28.800]  Have we talked about this in like a previous episode of like, like, like what's like the most
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.300]  unnatural food color? And I feel like blue was like the thing we landed on like a long time ago.
[05:33.680 --> 05:37.420]  What, what color would blueberries are like? They're like purple. Purple. I feel like. Yeah.
[05:38.360 --> 05:45.520]  Like a dark purple. Yeah, I don't think so. Kiwi is like murky white. Oh. Really? I think so. That's
[05:45.520 --> 05:50.320]  what, at least in my head. You said kiwi? Yeah, kiwi. How would kiwi not be green?
[05:51.240 --> 05:56.180]  Is it green? I feel like it's a very light green if it is green. It's not like a bright green.
[05:56.840 --> 06:01.880]  It's a very bright green. Isn't kiwi like the brightest green? Kiwi is like. Really? Yeah,
[06:01.980 --> 06:06.400]  what are you? What are you? No, no, no, no, no. The juice, the juice. If you squeeze the juice
[06:06.400 --> 06:10.100]  of a kiwi, I don't think it's bright green. Well, we should find out. Well, now we've got to start
[06:10.100 --> 06:16.620]  juicing shit and see if it matches. We got to juice a fucking kiwi now. I don't. I don't know.
[06:16.720 --> 06:20.300]  That's good. You're telling me that's going to make white juice. I still don't understand. I just.
[06:20.300 --> 06:28.460]  Oh, I mean, that's. Yeah, it's green. As I said, that's how I pictured it in my mind,
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.980]  which is not. I'm not saying that was factual. That's just how I envisioned it. Yeah, it's
[06:33.980 --> 06:41.880]  greener than it looks in my head. Do you eat the hair on a kiwi? I have. I prefer not to,
[06:42.140 --> 06:47.660]  but I have tried it. I thought I wouldn't like it, but it turns out it makes almost no impact
[06:47.660 --> 06:52.760]  on the taste. You're crazy. Do you think you might like eating other hair? You just haven't
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.600]  realized it yet. I would say of all the hair that I eat, kiwi hair is probably the best.
[06:58.440 --> 07:02.900]  It adds a huge difference to taste, in my opinion. Really? I'm surprised. Yeah,
[07:03.480 --> 07:06.660]  I think it's completely different. It's like you put a rug on your food.
[07:07.880 --> 07:16.940]  So we got we we officially we got Eric down for brown. Gavin is white. That figures. Andrew
[07:16.940 --> 07:24.260]  likes yellow or orange, it sounds like. And Nick and I are both blue boys. All right. All right.
[07:24.300 --> 07:28.440]  Blue's pretty good. Interesting. Interesting. I feel like I could be persuaded in a lot of
[07:28.440 --> 07:34.560]  different ways. Plus Pepsi blue. Remember that? Yeah, Pepsi blue. Purple. Limited, but good.
[07:35.040 --> 07:39.060]  I was trying to think the other day of, you know, like how, Andrew, you've never had an egg and
[07:39.060 --> 07:44.180]  other basic foods and stuff. I was trying to think of the most basic food that I've never had.
[07:44.780 --> 07:50.560]  Big blue. Oh, big blue. Is that is that the same company as Big Red? Yes, it is. Oh, I would like
[07:50.560 --> 07:55.080]  Big Blue way more than Big Red, I think. Yeah, it is. It's better. What is the most basic food
[07:55.080 --> 08:00.960]  you haven't had, Gavin? I think the most the food that I've passed by the most without eating is
[08:00.960 --> 08:07.640]  spam. Oh, OK. I've never gone for spam. I don't even really know what it is. I assume it's just
[08:08.820 --> 08:13.300]  pig offal. It's processed meat. Can't... Didn't we have a conversation recently,
[08:13.400 --> 08:17.660]  Gav, about doing a new show where we... What was it called? What do we call it?
[08:18.600 --> 08:23.220]  I think it was you that I talked to or where we talked about doing this very thing. I think it
[08:23.220 --> 08:28.760]  was me. And it was like First Timers or something like that. First Timers Club or something. Yeah.
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.840]  Yeah, it was something. And it was like we do we correct mistakes in our lives that like Gavin
[08:33.840 --> 08:38.760]  having never tried spam, Andrew never having an egg, me never trying, I don't know, whatever,
[08:39.220 --> 08:45.640]  some white shit I've never had. And it's like we just like with all the things that we should
[08:45.640 --> 08:51.120]  have done that we've never done. We we create a list and it's like like a bucket list of things
[08:51.120 --> 08:54.440]  that we should have done at this point in our lives that we haven't. So it's like a bucket list
[08:54.440 --> 09:00.220]  of of cherry pops. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. A bucket list
[09:00.220 --> 09:09.600]  of cherry pops. Yeah. Horrific, horrific way to put it. This is a we had to talk last episode
[09:09.600 --> 09:15.200]  about things that I prefer when free or that I think are only good when free. I compiled a little
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.880]  bit of list that we could go over a lot of food on that list. Surprisingly, this is what I have
[09:20.880 --> 09:30.300]  so far. Things I only like when free. Melon, sausage links, mints, suckers, toothbrushes,
[09:30.860 --> 09:38.440]  spinach, raspberry, anything behind a ticket counter, samples, Mark Wahlberg movies,
[09:39.060 --> 09:47.000]  getting feet measured, potato skins. Wait. Things I only like when free. Who's ever paid to get
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.960]  their feet measured? That's a good point. That's fair. It's just the thing I would never pay for,
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.800]  I guess, was the thing I thought of. I like health care. That's a good one. Health care is
[10:00.800 --> 10:07.280]  a good one. That is a good one. But that's good just generally. Health care is great. Health care
[10:07.280 --> 10:12.900]  and necessity. These are things that I only enjoy when free or that I would only opt for if free.
[10:12.900 --> 10:22.160]  What do you mean sausage links? Sausage links. So you would never buy a toothbrush? I wouldn't
[10:22.160 --> 10:27.120]  be excited about buying a toothbrush. But if I get given one for free, I'm happy about it. But
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.460]  I'm never excited about getting one. Not even an electric one? Oh, a sausage link is a sausage.
[10:33.140 --> 10:40.940]  Yeah. Sausage link. Instead of a patty or a crumble. Big fan of the patty. I'm a big fan
[10:40.940 --> 10:45.760]  patty too. Like that's the default sausage though. That picture. That's sausage. That's
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.420]  one of the ways that a person can eat sausage. Yeah. Like I would say that it's sausage there
[10:50.420 --> 10:57.200]  and then the sausage patties as like the side thing. I think what you're learning is that you
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.340]  just don't know what a sausage link is. It's an unfamiliar term to you. Yeah. It's like
[11:02.100 --> 11:07.480]  that's like calling it a melon fruit. Like we know it's a fruit. No, but it's a link. That's
[11:07.480 --> 11:14.560]  the link. Yeah. It's unlinked. It's not. Oh, do you think you could make a sausage chain? So do
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.920]  you think a chain, the links in a chain when they're unlinked stop being links? Uh, well,
[11:20.980 --> 11:26.120]  link in a chain is closed off, isn't it? Yeah, but these were two and connected at some point.
[11:26.160 --> 11:33.880]  They've been cut apart. I don't think Gavin understands sausage at all. Sausage is the
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.780]  shape. It's sausage. Like if a sausage dog... There's sausage links. Okay. Sausage is the
[11:39.780 --> 11:46.280]  ingredient. The link is the method it's being delivered to you by. Link or patty or crumble.
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.120]  Exactly. If anything, crumble I think would be the most pure sausage. Just the inside stuff.
[11:52.280 --> 11:56.380]  I just think if something's like a sausage or sausagey, it's that exact shape.
[11:56.900 --> 12:02.840]  I think that could apply to anything. I just, it's what your preference is. So when you called me
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.520]  many times in the past, a silly sausage, that's what you were referring to? Me in link form?
[12:09.180 --> 12:12.620]  Yeah. I mean, you could. Yeah, I think so. That's what I was envisioning.
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.120]  What's strange about this conversation is Gavin is, is articulating it in a way that
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.920]  someone is wrong when all he's doing is stating his perception of this thing.
[12:22.300 --> 12:25.420]  Absolutely. Oh, sausage patty. Oh, there's some good patties.
[12:26.040 --> 12:29.500]  So that, would you say that's more the base sausage than the link?
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.460]  No. No, I think the link is the most common, but it's just called a sausage.
[12:33.820 --> 12:38.040]  Absolutely. Yeah. Sausage link is the most common distribution method for sausage, I would say.
[12:38.300 --> 12:39.840]  Yeah. By far.
[12:40.460 --> 12:45.660]  Those are my list. Potato skins, best tasting item, way too expensive on menus.
[12:46.080 --> 12:47.560]  What do you mean by samples?
[12:48.860 --> 12:52.620]  Like if you go into a grocery store and they're handing out samples,
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.820]  I'm always going to like the thing on sample, but I will never enjoy it as much as I do in that
[12:57.820 --> 13:01.580]  context. If I buy the product and take it home, it will not be as good.
[13:02.420 --> 13:07.220]  Interesting. I thought of another question. I have, I have three questions. I only asked you
[13:07.220 --> 13:12.660]  guys one. Next question. Do you guys think, this isn't the one I just thought of. This was the,
[13:12.800 --> 13:18.600]  I had already thought of this one. Do you guys think that anyone's ever, I was buying bread
[13:18.600 --> 13:21.660]  the other day, right? I was looking at a loaf of wonder bread and I was just thinking about how
[13:21.660 --> 13:27.720]  much, is there like a standard amount of slices of bread in a loaf? And I was like, well, I could
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.180]  count and then see if it's the same as like the butter. And I was like, this is stupid. I'm not
[13:31.180 --> 13:34.640]  going to do this. But I was just thinking about like a loaf of bread is a lot of bread, you know,
[13:34.640 --> 13:38.560]  just like a regular ass loaf of white bread. And that got me thinking, do you think anybody has
[13:38.560 --> 13:44.980]  ever made one sandwich out of an entire loaf of bread? Oh God. Like if you had an uncut loaf
[13:44.980 --> 13:49.660]  and then carved it and put something in between. No, no. Cut and sliced. But it's like, think of
[13:49.660 --> 13:59.760]  a club sandwich with 80 floors. Like you just keep layering with each slice of bread,
[14:00.660 --> 14:05.540]  but you have to use an entire loaf to make one sandwich. I just think three is the limit of my
[14:05.540 --> 14:11.280]  jaw. I believe this is how the director of the raid pitched at the studio. So he had an eight
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.420]  layered sandwich. It was like, imagine bad guys on each one of these four. I just can't help but
[14:16.420 --> 14:21.020]  get a vertical loaf of bread with just a bunch of lettuce and tomatoes and sandwich meat sticking
[14:21.020 --> 14:27.620]  out of it. That looks like, you know, a tower would be a striking visual image. You're talking
[14:27.620 --> 14:33.640]  like Scooby-Doo style sandwich, like a real Scooby-Doo sandwich. I want, if I'm going to make
[14:33.640 --> 14:40.460]  a sandwich out of my bread, I'm cutting that bitch sideways. I want long slices on my loaf of bread,
[14:40.460 --> 14:46.620]  cut my bread sideways lengthwise. So we get long slices and I'm stacking it up that way.
[14:46.680 --> 14:51.880]  Can we do it both ways? Can we try both? Can we get pre-sliced loaf of bread and then an unsliced?
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.540]  I want to see if I make the bread tower that Jeff's talking about. I want to see if we can,
[14:57.020 --> 15:04.360]  that was what I was first envisioning. I think if we did do the tower with all the slices,
[15:04.600 --> 15:09.740]  we would have to employ one of our sandwich flattening techniques to get it down to the size
[15:09.740 --> 15:13.900]  that would fit in a mouth. Maybe we could use the guillotine. I like that a lot.
[15:14.460 --> 15:20.560]  All right. So let's, somebody add a note. I'm doing it right now. I'm putting in the
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.720]  idea bank right now. All right. Thank you so much. Yeah. While you're putting that in there,
[15:24.820 --> 15:34.740]  let me, let me posit this question to you. Gavin, you get $175,000 for one year tax-free. Okay.
[15:35.180 --> 15:41.200]  Actually, you get whatever it is, like after taxes. So you get like, that's your net, right? I
[15:41.200 --> 15:44.380]  don't know what the gross was. Whatever the, whatever the gross, you get the gross of whatever
[15:44.380 --> 15:48.940]  it takes for you to get the net of $175,000. So it's above board. You've paid taxes on it. That's
[15:48.940 --> 15:54.880]  your cut, right? So it's somewhere in the 250 range probably. But for one year, when you want
[15:54.880 --> 16:01.980]  to eat a food, you have to eat all of that food, but you can only eat one of that food. So like,
[16:01.980 --> 16:06.760]  you wanted a blueberry, you're allowed to have one blueberry in a 24-hour period. But if you
[16:06.760 --> 16:12.020]  wanted a pizza, you have to eat an entire pizza. If you wanted a watermelon, you have to eat the
[16:12.020 --> 16:17.680]  entire watermelon because that is one unit. But if you wanted Dorito, you could only eat one Dorito.
[16:18.340 --> 16:22.860]  Okay. So like, if I can hold it, if I can pinch it between two fingers and it just dangles,
[16:22.920 --> 16:27.620]  I can eat that. Yeah, I think so. I mean, you can eat anything as long as you eat exactly one
[16:27.620 --> 16:32.800]  of that thing. So you'd have to be really careful about your cravings. Because like,
[16:32.840 --> 16:36.760]  the first thing I thought of was like, oh, I just, I'll fucking eat fruit all day long. One orange,
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.480]  one apple, one watermelon. Whoa, whoa. One watermelon would take me some time. One fucking
[16:41.820 --> 16:48.340]  cantaloupe would take me some time, you know? One porterhouse steak, that's gonna fuck you up.
[16:50.180 --> 16:55.420]  So a cereal would suck. Yeah, yeah. I think, I think, I actually, it's interesting you say that.
[16:55.420 --> 17:00.920]  I got stuck on cereal because in my head, it was like, would it be one Cheerio or did you have to
[17:00.920 --> 17:04.920]  eat the entire box of Cheerios? No, I think it would be one Cheerio with a whole milk, with
[17:04.920 --> 17:10.420]  like a whole carton. Yeah, you'd have to use all of the milk in the container. You could only put
[17:10.420 --> 17:15.220]  one quarter. Do you think if it's like one Dorito, then it has to be one Cheerio? Yeah,
[17:15.280 --> 17:19.020]  that makes sense, right? So you'd just have to be like, you'd be like, all right, I want some
[17:19.020 --> 17:24.560]  bacon. I'll have one slice of bacon. I'll have one sausage link. I think I would be buying a lot
[17:24.560 --> 17:30.100]  of like, I'd be going to a lot of shitty hotels that don't have a proper breakfast, but they have
[17:30.100 --> 17:34.380]  that like dog shit little bar with the little packets of peanut butter that are tiny. You know,
[17:34.460 --> 17:38.260]  that kind of thing. Oh yeah. So I'd be taking like one bread, folding it over, using a little
[17:38.260 --> 17:42.140]  peanut butter. I'd just be getting like tiny versions of everything. You could do that because
[17:42.140 --> 17:47.480]  otherwise, if you wanted a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you would have two pieces of bread and
[17:47.480 --> 17:52.780]  an entire canister of peanut butter and an entire canister of jelly. I wonder if they do a little
[17:52.780 --> 17:58.980]  goober. They probably do. Yeah. You'd have to get like, you could only buy food at like truck stops.
[18:00.900 --> 18:05.240]  Interesting. I would do this. Well, like pasta would be annoying too. I like pasta.
[18:05.400 --> 18:08.440]  Like, yeah. Right. One spaghetti. You'd have one spaghetti.
[18:11.820 --> 18:14.940]  Gotta make that food on. Gotta get the most out of it you can.
[18:15.240 --> 18:18.940]  If you wanted to put tomato on your burger, you'd put an entire tomato on your burger.
[18:18.940 --> 18:25.260]  Well, what if we had a draft of one foods? Like a food that you only ever eat one of,
[18:25.280 --> 18:31.260]  like a hot dog is one bun. It's one dog. I guess you're having a little bit of ketchup.
[18:32.100 --> 18:37.480]  Some people are. I want to have a draft. See, I want the other way where we would have to draft
[18:38.320 --> 18:44.480]  the food that you wouldn't want to have to eat one of, but it would be for other people. So like,
[18:45.340 --> 18:50.020]  like what you just said about cereal and milk, because it would be one cereal and a whole gout,
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.040]  like a whole milk. That is, that would be like a number one on the draft for me. I think that
[18:55.040 --> 18:59.900]  would be fantastic. Drafting the worst one food. Yeah. I think the sources are out.
[19:00.220 --> 19:03.660]  If you bought a bag of rice, how long would it take you to finish the bag?
[19:03.760 --> 19:07.400]  Oh my God. It would be insane. How many, how many rices are in a...
[19:08.920 --> 19:12.580]  Yeah. Is it years worth? Yeah. I would think so.
[19:12.580 --> 19:15.920]  Uncle Ben's not cool. That might be all right. That'd be a decade worth.
[19:16.340 --> 19:19.420]  I don't even know how you would cook a rice. A rice?
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.380]  The same way you would cook all the rice. Just put it.
[19:23.620 --> 19:28.140]  Two to one rice to water. So you get half of a grain of rice of water.
[19:28.760 --> 19:32.520]  I think you could get a little egg cup, like an induction egg cup.
[19:32.880 --> 19:38.920]  There's no way. What? You get up and say, Oh, my rice cooker's done. I'll be back in a moment.
[19:38.920 --> 19:46.340]  It's just one singular rice. We, we should have a, a one blade of rice cook-off. Can you write
[19:46.340 --> 19:49.200]  that down? One grain of rice cook-off. Yep. So you can cook one grain of rice.
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.120]  Who decided, who decided that rice cookers have the ugliest I'm done sound?
[19:54.460 --> 19:57.580]  I can't say I've listened to a variety to... Nope.
[19:57.640 --> 20:00.040]  No. Oh really? They're always just like...
[20:00.040 --> 20:03.780]  Mine doesn't make a sound. It just kicks off. Yeah. Mine just made a ding.
[20:04.340 --> 20:07.820]  Oh, I used it last night. I've just been having bad rice cooker luck.
[20:07.820 --> 20:12.400]  What about a draft? That's the opposite of this where instead of like a one food or one
[20:12.400 --> 20:16.320]  worst food draft, it's the foods that you can eat the most of. So it's like blueberries,
[20:17.780 --> 20:22.100]  Doritos, like things that when you eat peanuts, you just eat like a handful, a ton of.
[20:22.880 --> 20:24.680]  I think that's fun. Couscous.
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.140]  Couscous would be great. Yeah. I love, you know, couscous is a thing I never think of,
[20:29.180 --> 20:32.000]  but I really enjoy. I do too. I really like couscous.
[20:32.180 --> 20:36.180]  But you know, lentils is that way for me as well. I really like lentils, but I never think about them.
[20:36.180 --> 20:40.100]  Well, I think that like couscous is small enough you could eat it through your nose.
[20:41.660 --> 20:46.960]  Yeah. Do you want to do a foods that Gavin can eat through his nose draft?
[20:47.240 --> 20:48.860]  No, the pool is too big.
[20:50.360 --> 20:55.260]  Oh, I asked for that. He says that you have a big nose.
[20:55.920 --> 21:00.520]  Imagine if your mouth was like cemented shut for a week because of medical reasons or whatever,
[21:00.840 --> 21:02.580]  you would still be able to eat through your nose.
[21:04.060 --> 21:05.480]  You know, I had small enough.
[21:06.080 --> 21:10.260]  I had my jaw wired shut for six weeks when I was in when I was 17 after my jaw surgery.
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.380]  And they I at no point did they think to put the food through my nose.
[21:14.480 --> 21:18.960]  I wish I had. Imagine if you just done a line of couscous and then, you know,
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.560]  you get it, you know, you suck it back and it's in your mouth and you can just
[21:21.560 --> 21:22.600]  swallow it like normal.
[21:23.320 --> 21:28.460]  Don't you hate when you get texts for somebody to like do dinner plans and you can't because
[21:28.460 --> 21:32.800]  your mouth has been cemented shut for a week due to medical reasons?
[21:32.920 --> 21:36.240]  Yeah. It's the worst.
[21:38.300 --> 21:39.520]  Always happens to me.
[21:39.920 --> 21:44.360]  Yeah. Jeff, you're talking about like new draft ideas, but I feel like we have
[21:44.820 --> 21:46.600]  so many that we're already sitting on.
[21:46.800 --> 21:48.700]  I know. These all just popped up all at once.
[21:49.360 --> 21:52.720]  OK, should we go through the list of draft ideas that we had and video
[21:52.720 --> 21:54.980]  supplemental ideas that we had on the boat the other Sunday?
[21:54.980 --> 22:01.560]  Yes, I do want to preface some of this that some of these are ideas that we all said,
[22:01.640 --> 22:08.480]  yeah, and then some of these are ideas that maybe just one person was really excited about.
[22:08.800 --> 22:10.380]  But but but they're on the list.
[22:10.600 --> 22:14.420]  So should we do a speed run of these because I haven't heard these and I could go thumbs up,
[22:14.500 --> 22:14.880]  thumbs down.
[22:15.300 --> 22:16.140]  Should we do a speed runner?
[22:16.360 --> 22:19.180]  Gavin just said that the ST word should we do?
[22:19.280 --> 22:20.320]  Is this a sausage talk, Gavin?
[22:20.360 --> 22:20.820]  Is that what you're saying?
[22:21.300 --> 22:21.980]  Sounds like it.
[22:22.340 --> 22:22.860]  Oh, wow.
[22:23.060 --> 22:24.820]  You guys want to get into a sausage talk then?
[22:24.820 --> 22:28.060]  Like on a day very soon to talk about these drafts?
[22:28.120 --> 22:28.680]  It's been a while.
[22:29.300 --> 22:31.660]  And we're post, we're post-gurp, aren't we?
[22:31.700 --> 22:31.860]  Sure.
[22:31.940 --> 22:33.180]  Yeah, we are post-gurp.
[22:33.340 --> 22:34.880]  So maybe we should hold off on these.
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.700]  All right, audience, enjoy the ideas we just gave you.
[22:38.820 --> 22:39.960]  But hold on.
[22:40.080 --> 22:42.640]  The other seven or eight will be coming in a different format.
[22:43.360 --> 22:43.800]  How?
[22:44.380 --> 22:46.420]  At some point in the undefined future.
[22:48.300 --> 22:51.200]  When you're starting a business, it's insanely stressful.
[22:51.560 --> 22:53.740]  It feels like you're spinning 16 plates at once.
[22:53.740 --> 22:55.700]  And as you proceed, they only multiply.
[22:56.060 --> 22:58.540]  It's why I'm so thankful for an incredible service like Shopify.
[22:59.080 --> 23:01.460]  Shopify, in my opinion, is the best of what it does.
[23:01.600 --> 23:05.440]  And knowing that we have all the support and tools it provides is the best feeling.

[23:55.340 --> 23:57.900]  I don't want to imagine having to navigate those things without it.

[25:00.580 --> 25:05.400]  How many of your... I was talking to Meg and she doesn't have the same thing.
[25:05.700 --> 25:09.480]  How many of your turds are emotional, would you say, in a given month?
[25:10.040 --> 25:11.540]  What the fuck?
[25:12.960 --> 25:20.120]  Now, do you mean the act or emotional in the sense that there's a squirrel massacre going on
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.420]  above me when using the bathroom? Because I feel like you might have a unique perspective.
[25:25.700 --> 25:26.260]  Squirrels are out.
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.080]  Squirrels are out? Good.
[25:28.620 --> 25:31.060]  Well, they're either trapped in or trapped out.
[25:31.620 --> 25:34.680]  Now, do you think it was the snake? Do you think there's just one very fat,
[25:34.780 --> 25:35.920]  happy snake in your ceiling?
[25:36.520 --> 25:37.100]  I don't think so.
[25:37.100 --> 25:41.920]  I think they probably just sealed the hole shut like a mouth for medical reasons.
[25:42.460 --> 25:43.420]  Pumped it full of gas.
[25:43.700 --> 25:43.960]  Yeah.
[25:44.880 --> 25:48.040]  But like, sometimes I'll just walk into the living room and my eyes are watering
[25:48.040 --> 25:51.720]  and I've got like a runny nose and Meg will be like, oh my god, what's happened?
[25:51.900 --> 25:53.840]  And I've just had a bit of an emotional one.
[25:54.540 --> 25:56.400]  I don't think I've ever had that, what you're describing.
[25:56.400 --> 25:58.260]  Like this shit makes you tear up?
[25:58.860 --> 26:02.360]  Yeah, there's no actual emotion. It's just like my face starts to leak.
[26:02.680 --> 26:03.880]  No, zero.
[26:04.120 --> 26:04.680]  You've never had that?
[26:04.680 --> 26:05.820]  I've never experienced that, no.
[26:06.400 --> 26:06.840]  Really?
[26:07.540 --> 26:14.860]  I mean, shitting is a constant part of my life and an often difficult part of my life and very,
[26:15.360 --> 26:20.040]  very frequently painful part of my life. And even then, I don't think I've ever gotten emotional
[26:20.040 --> 26:20.920]  about a shit.
[26:21.620 --> 26:27.940]  God, what's wrong with me then? I would say like maybe one a month, I get a bit sniffly from it.
[26:28.020 --> 26:30.820]  You get sniffly from it? That's odd, I feel like.
[26:31.820 --> 26:35.760]  Do you think you had some sort of attachment to the dinner you ate the night before and
[26:35.760 --> 26:36.760]  you're sad to see it go?
[26:37.860 --> 26:42.880]  This guy, he wants to eat flavorless protein cubes. I don't think there's an emotion with the food.
[26:43.780 --> 26:44.580]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[26:45.420 --> 26:47.140]  I didn't say flavorless, did I?
[26:47.640 --> 26:50.000]  I just feel like you would opt for flavorless.
[26:50.340 --> 26:53.680]  I think when you're dealing with protein cubes, flavorless is assumed.
[26:57.220 --> 27:00.940]  That is true. If it's flavored, then why are you not just eating that thing?
[27:01.900 --> 27:07.680]  I feel like the whole point of the cube is that it is zero joy. It is just the nutrients.
[27:07.700 --> 27:09.800]  The cube is that it's nice and quick.
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.740]  I could have lunch as quickly as it takes me to pick up my keys before going out the door.
[27:16.560 --> 27:20.960]  Yeah, you live your life. You live your fast food life.
[27:22.900 --> 27:24.540]  Whole other level of fast food.
[27:25.060 --> 27:28.020]  When you go out the door, do you take physical keys with you?
[27:28.620 --> 27:29.240]  That's a good question.
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.520]  I just assumed you'd open your front door with your phone or
[27:34.520 --> 27:36.500]  wave your hand or something technological.
[27:36.500 --> 27:38.820]  Gavin strikes me as an eyeball scan guy.
[27:39.140 --> 27:43.280]  Yeah, like a retinal scan to open your front door.
[27:44.060 --> 27:44.500]  Absolutely.
[27:44.580 --> 27:46.780]  Pretty cool. But then I feel like people would be off to my eyes.
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.940]  I think, I mean, I get where you're coming from, but I guess
[27:56.940 --> 28:00.000]  I feel like if they're that determined, there's other issues.
[28:00.880 --> 28:01.040]  Yeah.
[28:03.680 --> 28:05.120]  Take my keys, not my eyes.
[28:07.860 --> 28:08.740]  Yeah, fair enough.
[28:09.620 --> 28:11.980]  I have a continent idea I want to run by you guys.
[28:12.380 --> 28:13.320]  I'm very excited about.
[28:13.580 --> 28:14.140]  A condiment idea?
[28:14.740 --> 28:15.160]  Content.
[28:15.820 --> 28:18.620]  Oh, content. I thought he said continents. I thought he was going to make an eight continent.
[28:18.620 --> 28:20.080]  Yeah, we got a continent idea.
[28:20.580 --> 28:21.440]  Got to name them all.
[28:22.280 --> 28:29.040]  My content idea is because we just got the guillotine we showed from Jackass 4,
[28:29.600 --> 28:35.260]  our big prop, the most recent prop we got, that was somehow less expensive to acquire
[28:35.840 --> 28:40.240]  than any of the other props that we've we've bought by like times three.
[28:41.040 --> 28:42.140]  Yeah, that was a bargain.
[28:42.420 --> 28:46.820]  I think including the other prop we got in that auction, which we haven't talked about
[28:46.820 --> 28:50.820]  because we forgot that we have it just in a box, but we have all of Aaron McGarrity's cups
[28:51.340 --> 28:54.540]  that he wore when he got hit in the dick various different ways.
[28:54.920 --> 28:58.360]  I think we have like three of them. We have the slap shot one for sure.
[28:58.600 --> 29:03.400]  I think we have his hockey jersey from when he was doing the hockey one.
[29:04.120 --> 29:10.340]  But we have the guillotine and I want to put my money where my nose is.
[29:10.600 --> 29:18.020]  I was thinking about this. I think we should all create models of our nose
[29:18.600 --> 29:23.000]  and then stress test them by by dropping things using the guillotine.
[29:23.640 --> 29:27.540]  I mean, I've I've been trying to get you to scan your head for a year, probably.
[29:27.720 --> 29:31.540]  That's a more ambitious thing. That is more than nose.
[29:32.040 --> 29:34.920]  Yeah, but it makes sense for the nose to be on the head, surely.
[29:36.340 --> 29:38.480]  So you want everybody's full heads?
[29:40.440 --> 29:42.800]  Yeah. And then we got just like a bag of heads.
[29:43.600 --> 29:44.940]  I think that's great. I think that's a funny idea.
[29:45.040 --> 29:47.160]  It's just tougher to get head models.
[29:47.860 --> 29:50.540]  Gav, do you have a line on a head on a bag of heads you can get us?
[29:50.660 --> 29:52.180]  I could just print everyone's head.
[29:52.840 --> 29:53.620]  Okay. Okay.
[29:54.340 --> 29:57.140]  I love this idea. Does that work for you, Andrew?
[29:57.540 --> 30:00.900]  Yeah, I mean, we could do it. I'll have to figure out measurements for it.
[30:01.600 --> 30:06.080]  But didn't didn't he give you a phone and an app to scan like a hundred times?
[30:06.260 --> 30:08.840]  He did give me an app thing. But when you have a beard
[30:09.500 --> 30:13.460]  and like the type of my hair, like the beard is mainly the issue.
[30:13.920 --> 30:19.880]  Yeah, but I can I can deal with your beard. I'll just shave it down in my software.
[30:20.520 --> 30:22.760]  You can shave me via your software?
[30:23.620 --> 30:26.680]  Yeah, I'll like cut away your beard a little bit.
[30:29.810 --> 30:34.670]  See, but then I would feel like you're fucking with my setup.
[30:35.030 --> 30:38.730]  I feel like if my nose gave way, it would be because you manipulated the facial structure.
[30:39.430 --> 30:42.230]  Well, does there exist a bald cap for chins?
[30:42.730 --> 30:44.050]  I don't know.
[30:44.650 --> 30:46.850]  Because I feel like Uniform could get on that. Definitely.
[30:47.190 --> 30:48.690]  A bald cap for chins?
[30:49.310 --> 30:51.550]  Yeah, like a chin cap. I like this.
[30:52.350 --> 30:54.870]  Put it up there with the the tongue, tongue gloves.
[30:54.870 --> 31:01.070]  I did something recently where I had to scan my face into a thing.
[31:01.710 --> 31:03.710]  And it was an absolute...
[31:03.710 --> 31:05.770]  Do you mean the thing Gavin's been asking you to do for like a year?
[31:06.210 --> 31:07.870]  You've done it already for someone else?
[31:08.630 --> 31:10.190]  I did a different face scan.
[31:10.390 --> 31:11.810]  He did. You know what he did.
[31:12.690 --> 31:13.350]  You know.
[31:14.510 --> 31:21.770]  I did a different face scan, and it was the worst experience I've had in a long time.
[31:22.470 --> 31:31.450]  Just because I tried to use the balaclava of my face for the cam, but it doesn't fit my face.
[31:31.550 --> 31:36.010]  It's too small. And so it was gripping my face. So I did it once and I took it off.
[31:36.030 --> 31:38.410]  And I was like, finally done. Didn't work.
[31:38.970 --> 31:42.630]  So I thought, shit, OK, I guess I'll just leave it on until it works.
[31:43.190 --> 31:50.350]  I spent 45 minutes with it squishing my face, telling me that you need to do it again.
[31:50.390 --> 31:51.070]  It didn't work.
[31:51.070 --> 31:55.610]  Without any other instruction. And I eventually had to give up on it.
[31:56.090 --> 32:00.670]  But it was just grueling. I was so mad at the world and my own face.
[32:01.130 --> 32:03.810]  My own face was preventing me from scanning my face.
[32:04.450 --> 32:08.650]  The world will be able to see the results of your actual scan pretty soon on the gameplay channel.
[32:09.230 --> 32:10.070]  I love...
[32:10.070 --> 32:10.210]  It's true.
[32:10.830 --> 32:16.390]  I love this idea of using the guillotine in every day for other things, right?
[32:16.410 --> 32:18.050]  Like finding multiple uses for it.
[32:18.050 --> 32:24.310]  I think it should be how we cut sandwiches or bread or anything that needs to be sliced going forward.
[32:24.790 --> 32:31.230]  I was thinking we could even set it up with some tubes of paint where we could put a canvas in
[32:31.230 --> 32:36.170]  front of it and then drop the skateboard at different heights onto like tubes of paint
[32:36.170 --> 32:37.670]  and see if we can make paintings.
[32:37.990 --> 32:38.710]  That's fun.
[32:40.090 --> 32:47.470]  My initial idea was to model my nose and then, Gavin, you print it and then we like glue it
[32:47.470 --> 32:52.590]  to the Dilbot and drop the Dilbot from it to just do a nose test that way.
[32:53.050 --> 32:56.550]  So you would just drive the Dilbot onto its nose from a height?
[32:56.890 --> 32:58.250]  I think, yeah, yeah.
[32:58.330 --> 33:01.910]  And I think the nose, I might be able to still work around it.
[33:01.950 --> 33:04.270]  I'm not sure where the camera is in relation to the device.
[33:04.850 --> 33:08.050]  Obviously don't want a nose to block the center of the camera,
[33:08.070 --> 33:09.310]  but I think there's a way to make it work.
[33:09.530 --> 33:12.090]  Yeah, I think just below the little black bit would work.
[33:12.870 --> 33:13.810]  Below the eye bit.
[33:14.370 --> 33:19.650]  I just really like the idea of testing the nose with the guillotine.
[33:20.090 --> 33:25.790]  I think it's the perfect device to truly determine who has the most unbreakable nose.
[33:27.250 --> 33:29.350]  So should we print it in a material that will
[33:29.350 --> 33:33.550]  break and see who breaks the most or do we want them to be as sturdy as possible?
[33:34.630 --> 33:36.290]  That's another great question.
[33:37.530 --> 33:39.310]  It all has to be the same material.
[33:39.530 --> 33:42.210]  Yeah, I don't think it matters as long as they're all identically strong.
[33:42.750 --> 33:44.170]  Yeah, I think that's the way to go.
[33:44.770 --> 33:46.950]  I think it's a great idea to print the whole head as well,
[33:47.050 --> 33:49.770]  because we could just leave the heads down by the guillotine.
[33:50.230 --> 33:50.950]  It's a great idea.
[33:51.270 --> 33:52.910]  So it just looks like a bunch of people got beheaded.
[33:53.510 --> 33:53.810]  Yeah.
[33:54.370 --> 33:55.090]  I like it.
[33:55.930 --> 33:59.230]  We gotta figure out a bald cap for a chin. A chin cap.
[33:59.930 --> 34:01.830]  Or just do it with the beard.
[34:02.610 --> 34:04.250]  I don't, okay. Okay, I will.
[34:05.510 --> 34:06.250]  I'll give it a go.
[34:06.790 --> 34:10.570]  Does anyone have a tattoo on the inside of their lip?
[34:11.090 --> 34:11.890]  Tons of people.
[34:12.450 --> 34:13.510]  No, I mean on this book.
[34:13.930 --> 34:14.250]  No.
[34:14.870 --> 34:15.190]  No.
[34:16.510 --> 34:17.330]  Did you want to get one?
[34:17.390 --> 34:18.710]  I'm not an enslaved vampire.
[34:20.970 --> 34:23.150]  You don't want to get a FTW?
[34:23.650 --> 34:24.670]  That was always the big one.
[34:24.790 --> 34:25.710]  Fuck the world.
[34:26.090 --> 34:28.150]  Oh, I'm just, I'm like too scared to get a proper one,
[34:28.190 --> 34:30.350]  but I feel like I'd definitely get one on the inside of my lip.
[34:30.890 --> 34:32.890]  I bet it hurts like a motherfucker to do that.
[34:33.290 --> 34:36.770]  I would get, um, I'd get High Stanley written upside down.
[34:37.910 --> 34:38.230]  Why?
[34:38.930 --> 34:40.350]  Just the name of my dentist.
[34:43.010 --> 34:45.990]  So whenever he's rummaging around in there, he'd be like, oh, hello?
[34:46.630 --> 34:48.290]  I don't think he's going to notice.
[34:49.230 --> 34:49.950]  You don't?
[34:50.010 --> 34:50.910]  He would definitely notice.
[34:51.130 --> 34:53.810]  That would be funny if you did that and then your dentist retired
[34:53.810 --> 34:57.050]  and then you had to spend the rest of your life trying to find another dentist named Stanley.
[34:58.270 --> 34:59.470]  Oh, that would suck.
[34:59.630 --> 35:01.950]  Especially, yeah, like if I couldn't find another Stanley
[35:01.950 --> 35:04.630]  and a different person saw High Stanley, that would suck.
[35:04.890 --> 35:07.030]  I was thinking about this with my wife the other day.
[35:07.070 --> 35:09.150]  I was thinking, God, I'm never going to get divorced again.
[35:09.210 --> 35:11.210]  I'm going to be with Emily for the rest of my life.
[35:11.210 --> 35:12.710]  Guarantee you.
[35:13.050 --> 35:13.670]  Guarantee you.
[35:13.750 --> 35:16.010]  I'll move heaven and earth to stay married to this woman.
[35:16.270 --> 35:21.690]  However, if for whatever reason we did end up divorced or apart,
[35:22.190 --> 35:25.410]  I think I would only date women named Emily going forward
[35:25.410 --> 35:28.730]  so that I would never have to worry about calling somebody the wrong name
[35:28.730 --> 35:31.450]  or screwing up writing a card or you know what I mean?
[35:31.650 --> 35:35.350]  Like, just limit the dating pool down to that name and then you're safe.
[35:35.750 --> 35:36.950]  It's awkward, though.
[35:37.010 --> 35:39.890]  I'm sorry I named you after my dead wife.
[35:40.290 --> 35:41.130]  Sorry about that.
[35:41.970 --> 35:44.370]  I was thinking about the woman I loved who died.
[35:44.570 --> 35:47.270]  You've killed Emily in this scenario and my scenario, she's not dead.
[35:47.450 --> 35:50.730]  But I'm just I think that's the most emotional mistake wise.
[35:51.070 --> 35:53.770]  Yeah, but you're the one that said someone was going to get divorced this year.
[35:53.830 --> 35:55.990]  So you would think that you're just hoping for the divorce.
[35:56.230 --> 35:58.230]  Yeah, well, I don't have a death.
[35:58.450 --> 35:59.770]  I wasn't hoping for it.
[35:59.770 --> 36:01.950]  It was just a statistical probability.
[36:02.610 --> 36:05.430]  Do you have to get divorced from someone who died or is it just no?
[36:05.790 --> 36:06.790]  That doesn't count.
[36:06.830 --> 36:09.890]  Actually, if one of our spouses or one of us die this year,
[36:09.890 --> 36:11.530]  that does not count as a divorce for Andrew.
[36:12.350 --> 36:14.010]  Yeah, take that, Andrew.
[36:15.010 --> 36:16.150]  I got to call somebody.
[36:16.250 --> 36:16.670]  One second.
[36:18.530 --> 36:19.530]  You got to call him off.
[36:20.090 --> 36:21.070]  Yeah, I got to call him off.
[36:21.650 --> 36:26.590]  Andrew, when did the, you know, my my uploading score?
[36:27.130 --> 36:27.730]  When does that end?
[36:27.810 --> 36:28.810]  That's in August, right?
[36:28.850 --> 36:29.410]  It's this month.
[36:29.630 --> 36:30.350]  Well, it was this.
[36:30.510 --> 36:31.810]  Yeah, it was originally August.
[36:31.810 --> 36:34.090]  And then you went on vacation for like a month.
[36:34.090 --> 36:36.430]  And then we joked about, oh, if you were gone again,
[36:36.530 --> 36:39.030]  like, I guess we should push it back because you were gone for a month
[36:39.030 --> 36:42.030]  and then you were gone for another like three weeks after that.
[36:42.790 --> 36:43.650]  What are you talking about?
[36:43.710 --> 36:45.510]  When was I gone for a month or three weeks?
[36:47.250 --> 36:49.930]  Last month and then the month before that.
[36:50.510 --> 36:52.350]  The seven weeks you were gone, Gavin.
[36:53.030 --> 36:54.890]  But I did like eight recordings.
[36:55.030 --> 36:55.230]  I wasn't.
[36:55.430 --> 36:57.550]  That's like saying you've been gone for five years.
[36:57.590 --> 36:58.270]  What are you talking about?
[36:59.610 --> 37:04.030]  I'm saying we did a lot of recordings at a time to cover your absence.
[37:04.370 --> 37:07.350]  But there were recordings that would have occurred that you were not part of.
[37:07.490 --> 37:08.450]  The days that I was on a plane.
[37:08.450 --> 37:10.590]  I was around for the rest of it.
[37:10.790 --> 37:12.070]  That is true.
[37:12.190 --> 37:16.310]  We both did film recordings on our on our vacations with you guys.
[37:16.390 --> 37:17.010]  Here's the thing.
[37:17.530 --> 37:19.070]  You both recorded things.
[37:19.650 --> 37:21.390]  Jeff, you were in someone else's set up.
[37:21.410 --> 37:23.090]  So it's not like I'm going to randomly ask you.
[37:23.410 --> 37:24.770]  It was very nice that you're able to.
[37:24.850 --> 37:27.330]  But it wasn't like you could drop in or drop out whenever you want to.
[37:28.030 --> 37:29.470]  Gavin, you're on vacation.
[37:29.610 --> 37:30.090]  You're away.
[37:30.550 --> 37:31.570]  So even though you are available.
[37:33.030 --> 37:34.110]  What are you talking about?
[37:34.450 --> 37:35.190]  You're back home.
[37:35.430 --> 37:35.730]  You're not.
[37:35.830 --> 37:36.230]  You're not.
[37:36.410 --> 37:37.410]  I don't know what you're doing.
[37:37.410 --> 37:38.890]  You don't say what you're doing.
[37:38.970 --> 37:40.150]  You're just you say I'm out.
[37:40.410 --> 37:42.770]  Out could be I'm with the family in Spain.
[37:42.930 --> 37:44.230]  Out could be I'm doing a job.
[37:44.670 --> 37:45.310]  I don't know.
[37:45.530 --> 37:46.530]  I have no idea.
[37:46.810 --> 37:50.510]  And then when you do when you are at the thing, you just send us a picture of you holding a
[37:50.510 --> 37:52.570]  laptop toward the sky because there's no Internet.
[37:53.090 --> 37:56.630]  I did have to stand in a field to upload the video.
[37:57.070 --> 37:57.490]  That's true.
[37:57.630 --> 38:02.930]  Well, now, I don't I don't want to defend Gavin for being out so much because personally,
[38:03.070 --> 38:03.750]  very difficult.
[38:03.750 --> 38:07.610]  But but there is a difference in the calendar.
[38:08.010 --> 38:11.710]  If you look at last month's calendar, which Gavin doesn't have access to, for some reason,
[38:12.050 --> 38:19.930]  it is listed to as Gavin out and then listed as Gavin out out, which meant which is on
[38:19.930 --> 38:22.230]  of it, which is the same thing he's on of it.
[38:22.350 --> 38:27.050]  So Gavin out is Gavin is out, but still sort of available.
[38:27.050 --> 38:29.130]  But he changed one of his out out days.
[38:29.710 --> 38:30.770]  And that is true.
[38:30.850 --> 38:32.230]  And then out out changed.
[38:32.230 --> 38:32.650]  Yeah.
[38:33.810 --> 38:36.450]  Yeah, Nick was out.
[38:36.450 --> 38:39.210]  And then Nick's also out tomorrow.
[38:39.590 --> 38:41.210]  But I don't think Gavin's out out.
[38:41.370 --> 38:43.810]  I think you just need to give us out out days, Gavin.
[38:44.170 --> 38:45.670]  Just don't give us out out days.
[38:46.310 --> 38:46.690]  Why?
[38:46.770 --> 38:47.870]  Or only give us out out days.
[38:47.970 --> 38:48.470]  Sorry, I said that.
[38:48.610 --> 38:51.230]  Yeah, I feel like all of Nick's out days are out out days.
[38:51.570 --> 38:52.030]  Yeah, I agree.
[38:52.210 --> 38:52.370]  Yeah.
[38:52.430 --> 38:52.710]  Oh, yeah.
[38:52.770 --> 38:53.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:53.310 --> 38:53.630]  Absolutely.
[38:53.790 --> 38:57.790]  I schlepped like recording set up at an Xbox across the world.
[38:58.410 --> 38:59.770]  I'd say it was out.
[39:00.350 --> 39:00.770]  But yeah.
[39:00.870 --> 39:02.590]  Shall I only give you out out days?
[39:02.870 --> 39:05.570]  I think only out out days, because then if I look and I go,
[39:05.650 --> 39:08.210]  Gavin's technically available, I'll ask you to do things.
[39:08.370 --> 39:10.610]  OK, well, I'm going to go ahead and go the other way and say,
[39:10.670 --> 39:14.490]  don't fucking do that, because this is going to be an issue when we go,
[39:14.630 --> 39:17.190]  OK, let's meet at 11 and you go, well, that's not going to work for me
[39:17.690 --> 39:19.410]  because the time is so different here.
[39:19.670 --> 39:22.290]  That's so we I need to know when you're, you know,
[39:22.290 --> 39:25.150]  when we have to make adjustments for calendar, phrase it differently.
[39:25.670 --> 39:28.050]  I think out and out out totally makes sense.
[39:28.230 --> 39:29.050]  That's how I feel.
[39:29.530 --> 39:31.490]  I mean, I was still on the lay stuff.
[39:31.590 --> 39:35.210]  I did a Tony Hawk stream at like 11 p.m.
[39:35.290 --> 39:36.230]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[39:36.270 --> 39:36.770]  That's great.
[39:36.890 --> 39:39.110]  And so it's good to know that that stuff is happening.
[39:39.270 --> 39:43.650]  So that way we don't have to rely on you for that stuff and we can work around it.
[39:43.850 --> 39:45.930]  But what Andrew, I understand what Andrew's saying.
[39:46.430 --> 39:48.910]  From a producer standpoint, please don't do that to me.
[39:49.270 --> 39:52.690]  OK, but if we're going on Andrew rules based on what Andrew just said
[39:52.690 --> 39:55.870]  in the last two months, I was out out for four days.
[39:56.090 --> 39:56.870]  OK, continue.
[39:58.410 --> 39:59.330]  Continue with what?
[39:59.910 --> 40:00.470]  With how?
[40:00.630 --> 40:04.690]  With have I made it to the end of the frickin I've I've uploaded everything I needed to.
[40:04.790 --> 40:06.230]  You extended it to September.
[40:07.610 --> 40:09.170]  But there's only four days.
[40:09.370 --> 40:11.950]  Just calm down.
[40:12.470 --> 40:13.390]  OK, you're getting really mad.
[40:13.550 --> 40:20.070]  You're heated when really what I have in my notes is to say,
[40:20.070 --> 40:21.090]  Gavin, thank you.
[40:21.210 --> 40:22.730]  You've done a really good job of uploading.
[40:23.110 --> 40:23.870]  It's in my notes.
[40:24.490 --> 40:25.310]  Oh, thanks.
[40:25.650 --> 40:26.510]  You've done great.
[40:26.950 --> 40:28.230]  He's on your side.
[40:28.710 --> 40:29.210]  On my side.
[40:29.650 --> 40:34.370]  You have made a significant improvement in availability for that stuff or like making
[40:34.370 --> 40:37.250]  sure it's there, not availability, but like that it's in its folder.
[40:37.750 --> 40:38.790]  You've done great.
[40:39.070 --> 40:40.830]  I literally have it in my notes.
[40:41.310 --> 40:42.390]  Give Gavin credit.
[40:42.850 --> 40:44.910]  He is shifted and made a change.
[40:45.350 --> 40:47.770]  I'm no longer constantly asking him to upload things.
[40:47.770 --> 40:50.590]  Oh, wait, that's what your note was.
[40:50.690 --> 40:52.670]  And then we went through all of that to get to you.
[40:52.870 --> 40:54.910]  Yeah, because that's the way he wanted it to go.
[40:58.530 --> 41:02.150]  Yeah, Gavin shouldn't be so combative every time someone's trying to compliment him.
[41:02.270 --> 41:06.350]  Well, I mean, I just think it's wild that he said I was on vacation for two months.
[41:06.830 --> 41:10.330]  Well, I don't know you were you were out of the country for two months.
[41:10.610 --> 41:11.830]  You didn't say he didn't say two months.
[41:11.850 --> 41:12.690]  He said seven weeks.
[41:13.090 --> 41:14.110]  OK, I apologize.
[41:17.410 --> 41:23.550]  I was thinking maybe for the next yearly counter experiment, do we know that?
[41:23.810 --> 41:25.050]  Do we know the average on burgers?
[41:28.070 --> 41:30.610]  Because I think we would have wildly different numbers.
[41:30.990 --> 41:33.350]  I think average Andrew is going to be the one to be.
[41:33.710 --> 41:35.390]  We're looking at that's Google.
[41:35.390 --> 41:36.380]  I don't trust that.
[41:39.310 --> 41:41.750]  Hundred and fifty burgers a year.
[41:41.870 --> 41:43.510]  Don't don't don't don't read the Google.
[41:43.510 --> 41:44.830]  And then just say it.
[41:44.930 --> 41:45.670]  That's not what we're doing.
[41:45.750 --> 41:46.610]  We got to find an actual.
[41:46.890 --> 41:47.670]  We got to find a source.
[41:48.070 --> 41:50.310]  Well, I'm reading all about burger dot com.
[41:51.530 --> 41:52.250]  Hang on.
[41:52.390 --> 41:52.890]  Hang on.
[41:55.830 --> 41:58.530]  You're reading all about burger dot com.
[41:58.750 --> 42:00.750]  A burger dot com all about burger.
[42:01.530 --> 42:03.370]  They're like a national burger society.
[42:03.470 --> 42:07.950]  The average American eats three burgers a week, which adds up to more than 150 burgers a year,
[42:08.030 --> 42:10.170]  according to all about burgers dot com.
[42:10.310 --> 42:11.310]  Three a week.
[42:11.350 --> 42:12.730]  There's no there's no way.
[42:13.310 --> 42:15.830]  That's not we have we got if there's got to be a better story.
[42:15.970 --> 42:17.270]  That's insane, dude.
[42:17.470 --> 42:22.350]  I not to get into a whole hot dog thing of it, but I definitely probably eat three hamburgers a week.
[42:22.390 --> 42:23.270]  Are you serious?
[42:24.250 --> 42:26.230]  It's like this to me.
[42:26.270 --> 42:28.290]  The hamburger is lunch.
[42:28.430 --> 42:30.450]  It's the standard American lunch.
[42:30.510 --> 42:33.810]  If I'm out and I'm hungry, I'm like, oh, just swing by and grab a burger from P.
[42:33.870 --> 42:35.850]  Terry's or I will say in and out of yesterday.
[42:37.410 --> 42:40.870]  Oh, I think we should do this because I'm fascinated.
[42:40.870 --> 42:43.150]  I think I maybe do one every two months or something.
[42:43.430 --> 42:44.530]  I don't want to do.
[42:44.690 --> 42:48.350]  I don't want to get into sausage talk territory because I know we have that coming up.
[42:48.410 --> 42:52.530]  But one of the ideas on the drafts board is also another yearly food related thing.
[42:52.650 --> 42:54.470]  So we have some other stuff as well.
[42:54.850 --> 42:55.210]  OK.
[42:56.050 --> 42:58.310]  But I like this idea and I'm into this idea.
[42:58.990 --> 43:00.150]  When would you want to start?
[43:00.270 --> 43:02.010]  Do you want to start September 1st?
[43:02.110 --> 43:03.510]  Yeah, like back to school.
[43:04.550 --> 43:05.470]  That's that's lame.
[43:05.550 --> 43:07.270]  Is it Labor Day, September 1st?
[43:07.270 --> 43:08.750]  Yeah, that's Labor Day.
[43:08.810 --> 43:09.110]  All right.
[43:09.110 --> 43:12.830]  So September 1st to September 1st, Labor Day to Labor Day.
[43:12.990 --> 43:14.570]  Let's let's count our heart.
[43:14.770 --> 43:16.650]  And it's not a contest, not a contest.
[43:17.010 --> 43:18.970]  And I just do need an important clarification.
[43:19.070 --> 43:22.530]  Is a double and a single the same or is a double tuber?
[43:22.730 --> 43:23.130]  Same.
[43:23.450 --> 43:24.870]  I think it's a single.
[43:25.090 --> 43:25.870]  It's a single item.
[43:26.130 --> 43:29.230]  Like if you can order it as like it would say one next to quantity.
[43:29.310 --> 43:29.930]  That's the item.
[43:30.410 --> 43:30.630]  Yeah.
[43:31.110 --> 43:34.430]  OK, then I feel like we should know doubles or singles as well.
[43:34.590 --> 43:35.450]  This doesn't make sense.
[43:36.270 --> 43:36.790]  I we got it.
[43:36.790 --> 43:40.950]  We got to like really dial in on like this number because some of this is this does not seem right.
[43:41.070 --> 43:42.130]  It doesn't make sense to you.
[43:42.230 --> 43:47.910]  But I'm telling you, after the hot dog thing, I saw so many comments from people who were like,
[43:48.130 --> 43:52.190]  Jeff said that it's insane that anybody could eat 70 hot dogs in a year,
[43:52.210 --> 43:54.350]  but he just doesn't understand the common man.
[43:54.430 --> 43:56.810]  I've eaten 450 hot dogs a year.
[43:56.810 --> 43:58.850]  I ate 800 hot dogs last year.
[43:58.910 --> 43:59.510]  Not the common man.
[43:59.510 --> 44:00.570]  Jeff doesn't know what he's talking about.
[44:00.610 --> 44:01.850]  Not the common man.
[44:01.850 --> 44:04.090]  I have 100 hot dogs a month.
[44:04.090 --> 44:06.550]  And it's like, fucking Christ, you might.
[44:06.830 --> 44:09.530]  But I don't think my mother has had a hot dog in 20 years.
[44:09.530 --> 44:12.010]  I don't think my daughter had more than three a year.
[44:12.070 --> 44:14.090]  My wife has had about 10 in the last year.
[44:14.350 --> 44:17.350]  All the guys I work with have fell in somewhere between like a tenth
[44:17.350 --> 44:20.010]  or a quarter of the yearly average.
[44:20.010 --> 44:22.810]  I came in like 90 percent towards the yearly average.
[44:22.890 --> 44:24.370]  I was trying to hit it.
[44:24.630 --> 44:28.290]  I think there's a lot of people out there in the world who don't eat as many hot dogs as you think,
[44:28.370 --> 44:33.590]  just like there are obviously a lot of people out there who eat more hot dogs than you think
[44:33.590 --> 44:35.470]  or that I eat, obviously.
[44:36.190 --> 44:37.370]  The pool was all Americans.
[44:37.670 --> 44:39.690]  It wasn't just the common man.
[44:39.770 --> 44:41.490]  Yeah, it's all Americans.
[44:41.950 --> 44:45.050]  I was thinking about if I had ever hit the hot dog quota,
[44:45.150 --> 44:47.190]  and I think I did in the summer of 05.
[44:48.390 --> 44:49.710]  That's so specific!
[44:50.710 --> 44:51.050]  What do you mean?
[44:51.190 --> 44:52.210]  I'm pretty sure the summer of 05.
[44:52.250 --> 44:53.690]  That was a big hot dog summer for me.
[44:54.230 --> 44:55.250]  How do you remember?
[44:55.630 --> 44:56.450]  You would have been 11.
[44:56.850 --> 45:01.370]  I don't remember the company, but they had just introduced a product named the Top Dog,
[45:01.370 --> 45:08.130]  which I really liked, where it was a singular wiener in a little plastic casing and you could
[45:08.130 --> 45:12.710]  throw it in the microwave and then the casing would split and you'd know it was done.
[45:13.210 --> 45:17.890]  And then you'd peel the casing and then you'd pop the dog on a bun and eat a hot dog.
[45:18.130 --> 45:22.990]  And I ate so many Top Dogs the first year that they were around, which I think,
[45:23.070 --> 45:26.190]  at least in my market, was the summer of 05.
[45:26.370 --> 45:29.410]  I probably was eating like two or three hot dogs every day.
[45:29.410 --> 45:33.050]  I was trying to think, how do you make a hot dog less healthy?
[45:33.190 --> 45:36.050]  And putting it in the microwave in plastic seems to be the way.
[45:36.090 --> 45:37.410]  Oh, it's a Top Dog, baby!
[45:37.810 --> 45:38.910]  What do you mean less healthy?
[45:38.970 --> 45:39.710]  It's number one!
[45:40.190 --> 45:44.270]  Andrew, something about the way you said hot dog summer really got to me.
[45:45.250 --> 45:46.810]  It was a hot dog summer!
[45:47.250 --> 45:50.610]  I really like... I want 2005 to be known as hot dog summer.
[45:50.850 --> 45:52.170]  I just looked up a list.
[45:52.250 --> 45:53.670]  I don't know what exactly we can do with this,
[45:53.730 --> 45:57.130]  but I wanted to see what other products were introduced in the summer of 2005.
[45:57.310 --> 45:58.530]  So I put a Wikipedia list.
[45:58.530 --> 46:02.770]  Maybe we should do some sort of a thing themed around the summer of 2005 someday.
[46:03.050 --> 46:05.590]  Do you know that's when the Shuffle and the Nano came out?
[46:05.850 --> 46:06.210]  Really?
[46:07.330 --> 46:08.610]  And Hurricane Katrina?
[46:09.630 --> 46:10.290]  Apple Remote?
[46:10.570 --> 46:11.330]  Beaver Buzz?
[46:11.470 --> 46:12.190]  I don't know what that is.
[46:12.470 --> 46:14.070]  Tag Body Spray.
[46:14.270 --> 46:15.330]  Now we're talking.
[46:15.670 --> 46:16.210]  Oh, wow!
[46:16.350 --> 46:16.850]  Yeah!
[46:18.130 --> 46:19.450]  Furryville, all right!
[46:19.690 --> 46:20.830]  Oh, it's something different.
[46:22.970 --> 46:23.930]  Furryville was different.
[46:24.090 --> 46:28.450]  Anyway, I want to investigate hot dog summer of 2005 in some way.
[46:28.450 --> 46:30.070]  In the future, content related.
[46:30.410 --> 46:31.350]  Oh, LifeStraw.
[46:32.210 --> 46:33.850]  This is crazy.
[46:34.130 --> 46:40.010]  According to the USDA, 222 pounds per person of ground beef,
[46:40.250 --> 46:43.450]  which averages out to 2.4 burgers per day.
[46:43.630 --> 46:45.270]  There's no way these numbers are right.
[46:45.390 --> 46:46.370]  But that's not...
[46:46.370 --> 46:47.550]  That's ground beef, dude.
[46:47.590 --> 46:48.670]  Yes, I agree.
[46:48.790 --> 46:50.110]  That could be spaghetti sauce.
[46:50.690 --> 46:52.170]  That could be a lot of things.
[46:52.390 --> 46:52.770]  Absolutely.
[46:53.990 --> 46:55.250]  This is like...
[46:55.250 --> 46:57.270]  We have to drill down and find the average.
[46:57.270 --> 46:58.650]  It might be three.
[46:58.790 --> 47:01.690]  I'm finding a lot of places that say three burgers per week.
[47:02.070 --> 47:03.470]  Yeah, I think that's the average.
[47:03.570 --> 47:04.470]  I think it's the average.
[47:04.710 --> 47:05.290]  I mean, if the...
[47:05.290 --> 47:05.990]  Think about it this way.
[47:06.030 --> 47:10.130]  If the national average is like 75 hot dogs a year,
[47:10.250 --> 47:12.110]  why wouldn't it be double that for burgers?
[47:12.310 --> 47:15.470]  According to PBS, Americans eat three hot dogs...
[47:15.470 --> 47:16.810]  Or I'm sorry, three hamburgers a week.
[47:17.210 --> 47:18.530]  156 hamburgers a year.
[47:18.930 --> 47:20.090]  156 is the over-under.
[47:21.010 --> 47:21.310]  156.
[47:21.310 --> 47:22.930]  My last question in regards to this.
[47:22.930 --> 47:23.370]  Wow!
[47:23.790 --> 47:24.490]  Chicken burgers.
[47:25.310 --> 47:25.890]  Different thing.
[47:25.910 --> 47:26.510]  Not countable.
[47:26.510 --> 47:27.310]  Only beef.
[47:29.510 --> 47:31.370]  I would say a chicken burger is part of this.
[47:31.510 --> 47:32.330]  If it's like a set...
[47:32.330 --> 47:32.610]  Like a...
[47:33.670 --> 47:35.210]  If it looks like a burger.
[47:35.810 --> 47:37.110]  I think here's...
[47:37.110 --> 47:39.090]  Chicken burger sounds weird to me.
[47:39.210 --> 47:40.390]  But turkey burger I would allow.
[47:40.530 --> 47:41.670]  So I guess I got all that chicken.
[47:41.790 --> 47:41.930]  Yeah.
[47:42.110 --> 47:44.130]  Or like a lamb burger I would allow.
[47:44.270 --> 47:47.550]  So any food that is called burger is part of the burger.
[47:47.570 --> 47:50.910]  Like we understand what a burger is and as long as it fits that.
[47:51.010 --> 47:51.130]  Okay.
[47:51.770 --> 47:53.010]  I think the burger is the format.
[47:53.290 --> 47:53.490]  Yeah.
[47:53.810 --> 47:54.090]  Got it.
[47:54.090 --> 47:56.310]  If the burger comes say like...
[47:56.310 --> 47:57.530]  You know, normally it's served on a bun.
[47:57.630 --> 48:01.290]  But what if it was a specialty burger that's served on like a tortilla or like...
[48:01.290 --> 48:01.870]  I think that's fine.
[48:02.090 --> 48:02.430]  A bed of lettuce or something.
[48:02.490 --> 48:03.970]  No, I think that's...
[48:04.830 --> 48:05.730]  There's some pretty...
[48:05.730 --> 48:06.250]  Yeah, like...
[48:06.250 --> 48:07.870]  Are you talking about like those like...
[48:07.870 --> 48:12.210]  That place in San Antonio that has like those Frito burger things?
[48:12.630 --> 48:12.870]  Yeah.
[48:13.150 --> 48:13.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:13.630 --> 48:13.910]  Exactly.
[48:14.430 --> 48:16.950]  Or like you could get lettuce as a...
[48:16.950 --> 48:17.490]  Instead of the bun.
[48:17.610 --> 48:18.050]  Like they're...
[48:18.050 --> 48:19.130]  I'm fine with all of it.
[48:19.410 --> 48:22.230]  And also like near meat would count.
[48:22.310 --> 48:23.010]  Impossible burger.
[48:23.270 --> 48:23.370]  Yeah.
[48:23.370 --> 48:23.870]  Anything like that.
[48:23.870 --> 48:25.010]  Meat alternatives.
[48:25.010 --> 48:25.370]  Yeah.
[48:25.470 --> 48:26.630]  I had any veggie burger.
[48:26.970 --> 48:29.250]  I just don't see how it could be a burger if it's a tortilla.
[48:29.950 --> 48:30.970]  Oh, it's still a burger.
[48:31.830 --> 48:32.010]  How?
[48:32.830 --> 48:33.710]  It's hamburger meat.
[48:34.890 --> 48:36.210]  Formed into a patty.
[48:36.450 --> 48:37.810]  We just said chicken was fine.
[48:38.510 --> 48:41.290]  Like a chicken in a tortilla is not a burger to me.
[48:42.770 --> 48:43.570]  Um, true.
[48:43.810 --> 48:44.630]  But if it's called...
[48:44.630 --> 48:47.930]  If it's a specialty item on a menu and it's called like the something something burger
[48:47.930 --> 48:48.930]  that's served in a tortilla.
[48:49.190 --> 48:52.010]  I think if it's in the burger section of the menu, I think you're fine.
[48:52.010 --> 48:54.170]  Yeah, if it's listed under hamburgers, you're fine.
[48:54.610 --> 48:54.750]  Okay.
[48:55.190 --> 48:55.670]  Yeah.
[48:56.210 --> 49:00.130]  I think if you're just doing this at home and calling it a burger, that's one thing.
[49:00.190 --> 49:03.250]  But if you're going to a restaurant and they're doing a specialty thing,
[49:03.310 --> 49:04.910]  I think that's totally in the clear.
[49:05.670 --> 49:06.010]  Excellent.
[49:06.950 --> 49:07.670]  I'm excited.
[49:08.150 --> 49:09.410]  These are going to be interesting totals.
[49:09.950 --> 49:10.710]  September 1st.
[49:10.750 --> 49:11.490]  I think I'm...
[49:11.490 --> 49:13.250]  Oh man, I feel pretty good about this.
[49:14.070 --> 49:16.930]  I definitely eat more hamburgers than hot dogs.
[49:17.170 --> 49:17.790]  It's not a contest.
[49:18.090 --> 49:18.610]  Not a contest.
[49:19.090 --> 49:19.850]  Not a contest!
[49:20.470 --> 49:22.850]  Yeah, but it isn't.
[49:22.910 --> 49:23.330]  You're right.
[49:24.130 --> 49:25.850]  It's definitely not a contest.
[49:26.650 --> 49:30.610]  Okay, I've made the Slack channel, but we can't use it until September 1st.
[49:30.790 --> 49:31.170]  Okay.
[49:31.650 --> 49:35.220]  I'm also going to archive dog count because we have...
[49:35.610 --> 49:36.270]  we did it.
[49:36.870 --> 49:38.330]  So good work on that one.
[49:38.330 --> 49:39.050]  Good job, everybody.
[49:49.850 --> 49:51.950]  While also staying in control.
[49:52.950 --> 49:59.750]  Enjoy the drive in Blue Cruise enabled vehicles like the F-150, Explorer, and Mustang Mach-E.

[50:10.410 --> 50:13.890]  The twisted tale of Amanda Knox is coming to Hulu.
[50:14.310 --> 50:17.630]  In 2007, Amanda Knox was studying abroad in Italy.
[50:17.630 --> 50:21.250]  She had no idea her dream would turn into a nightmare.
[50:21.910 --> 50:26.490]  Inspired by the actual events of her wrongful conviction and 15-year fight for freedom.
[50:26.930 --> 50:32.190]  Watch the new Hulu original series The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox on August 20th.
[50:32.430 --> 50:36.210]  Streaming on Hulu and Hulu on Disney Plus for bundle subscribers.
[50:36.570 --> 50:37.110]  Terms apply.
[50:38.810 --> 50:43.570]  We should try to schedule Sausage Talk for sometime early next week so we can get these ideas
[50:43.570 --> 50:47.170]  written down before we forget them or lose enthusiasm.
[50:47.630 --> 50:52.410]  I would love it if we could get a website where there's just like a live count.
[50:53.450 --> 50:54.290]  We had that.
[50:54.370 --> 50:54.710]  If people want to check.
[50:55.210 --> 50:57.470]  There was a community-made one for hot dogs.
[50:58.190 --> 50:59.130]  Who was updating it?
[50:59.830 --> 51:06.770]  I don't remember the user's name or the person's name, but they had one and they reached out to us
[51:06.770 --> 51:12.290]  over Patreon to ask if we could forward our totals to them so they could have an accurate number.
[51:12.570 --> 51:16.950]  There were more than 4,000 community hot dogs tracked using their website.
[51:16.950 --> 51:17.990]  That's amazing.
[51:18.230 --> 51:24.990]  I would love to talk to somebody out there in the world, maybe in the community, about
[51:26.330 --> 51:34.390]  designing some sort of a website that displays some sort of a visual timeline of all of our
[51:34.390 --> 51:37.070]  content so that it's a little bit easier to find.
[51:37.130 --> 51:42.170]  I had to go back and find something the other day and it was a little conflated,
[51:42.810 --> 51:44.530]  the process to try to find this old video.
[51:44.530 --> 51:48.150]  I don't know if there's anybody in the community that wants to lend their talents to that,
[51:48.230 --> 51:51.890]  but I would love to hire somebody or figure something out where we could just have a
[51:51.890 --> 51:57.970]  repository that's easy to see or index or search all the disparate amounts of content that we've
[51:57.970 --> 51:58.230]  created.
[51:58.590 --> 52:03.350]  On Patreon, if it didn't happen in the last 10 days, it's pretty difficult to get to.
[52:03.970 --> 52:06.390]  We do have the collections tab, which makes it a lot easier.
[52:06.510 --> 52:10.510]  It helps. It helps. And that's eventually how I found what I was looking for. But yeah, it's still...
[52:10.510 --> 52:14.670]  It's a limit. I'm not complaining about it. It's a limitation of Patreon. I just,
[52:14.750 --> 52:17.930]  I'm not trying to complain about it. It is what it is. I just think it might be cool
[52:17.930 --> 52:19.270]  if we had like a website you could go to.
[52:19.650 --> 52:23.330]  Speaking of like prop auctions and, you know, we got the guillotine recently.
[52:23.550 --> 52:28.190]  I just got an email that I got outbid on an item that I forgot I bid on two weeks ago.
[52:28.710 --> 52:33.130]  The auction is not live yet. We've talked about before, Jeff, you and I,
[52:33.750 --> 52:38.230]  about an estate auction is weird because you have the item and you know that you only have it
[52:38.230 --> 52:42.350]  because that person's dead. And that's just not a great feeling necessarily.
[52:42.650 --> 52:45.650]  Yeah, it's like everybody wanted me to buy stuff from the David Lynch estate.
[52:45.950 --> 52:51.150]  And it was like, I liked him too much to pour through a dead guy's things.
[52:51.330 --> 52:51.510]  Yep.
[52:51.630 --> 52:53.330]  If that makes sense. It felt weird to me.
[52:53.590 --> 52:58.370]  I completely agree with you on that. There is one coming up where I do not feel that way at all.
[52:58.490 --> 53:04.790]  And it is the estate sale of Larry King. And one of the things that is up for auction
[53:04.790 --> 53:07.050]  is his Shrek 2 reading script.
[53:07.050 --> 53:09.910]  Wow, that's awesome.
[53:10.570 --> 53:17.510]  It has his lines highlighted and it comes with like a poster, I think, and like something else.
[53:17.650 --> 53:22.550]  I like a framed variety story about with his character on the front of it.
[53:24.030 --> 53:26.630]  I forgot I bid on that. It was very cheap.
[53:27.970 --> 53:31.250]  And I'm glad I got outbid because I don't necessarily want it.
[53:31.330 --> 53:36.190]  It was just the cheapest thing that I thought was stupid that was available to buy.
[53:37.050 --> 53:42.410]  But I guess if people want a Shrek 2 reading script that was once owned by Larry King,
[53:43.070 --> 53:44.230]  you can go get it.
[53:44.750 --> 53:48.070]  So Americans eat 50 billion burgers a year.
[53:48.410 --> 53:49.190]  Not Larry King.
[53:51.230 --> 53:53.710]  They have... I'm just reading this dumb website.
[53:54.010 --> 53:57.770]  They have 8 million gallons of mustard. We consume 8 million gallons of mustard.
[53:57.910 --> 54:00.610]  I don't even know how you make mustard. Have you guys ever made mustard?
[54:00.830 --> 54:03.770]  It's a seed. And then you crush it up, right?
[54:04.370 --> 54:04.550]  Yeah.
[54:04.870 --> 54:05.070]  Ground it.
[54:05.070 --> 54:07.310]  I know that mustard is a seed. I've cooked with it before,
[54:07.350 --> 54:11.730]  but I've never turned that seed into a yellow sauce that I put on top of a hamburger before.
[54:11.950 --> 54:13.430]  I don't know what the process is.
[54:13.790 --> 54:15.750]  I assume water's involved.
[54:15.890 --> 54:19.770]  I assume if you put it in one of those grinders and you got to crush it up.
[54:20.210 --> 54:21.710]  I bet there's more to it than that.
[54:22.070 --> 54:23.230]  Probably vinegar in there.
[54:23.690 --> 54:24.250]  I bet we...
[54:25.490 --> 54:28.290]  Now, vinegar is... I have no idea where vinegar comes from.
[54:28.610 --> 54:29.790]  I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
[54:30.130 --> 54:30.550]  Yeah, vinegar, water, wine.
[54:30.550 --> 54:33.290]  If somebody told me to make vinegar, how do I do that?
[54:34.390 --> 54:35.990]  I get water and then what?
[54:36.810 --> 54:38.490]  Maybe I'll get into being a...
[54:38.490 --> 54:41.310]  I've already decided I'm going to be the sack of burgers guy,
[54:41.410 --> 54:43.810]  which is really going to come in handy over the next year,
[54:43.930 --> 54:45.530]  because this is already something Nick and I worked out.
[54:45.850 --> 54:46.270]  Oh, yeah.
[54:46.530 --> 54:49.250]  Where anytime I show up, I just want to show up with a sack of burgers.
[54:49.630 --> 54:50.290]  Be like, anybody want a burger?
[54:51.230 --> 54:53.190]  Maybe I'll be a mustard maker.
[54:53.570 --> 54:56.210]  Get into artisan mustard making.
[54:56.350 --> 54:57.330]  DIY mustard?
[54:57.570 --> 55:01.570]  Yeah, what if I develop a really good mustard recipe and then it...
[55:02.510 --> 55:03.230]  It's awesome.
[55:03.370 --> 55:05.090]  Can you plant mustard in your backyard?
[55:05.950 --> 55:06.670]  Yeah, probably.
[55:07.350 --> 55:08.270]  Is it just like a...
[55:08.270 --> 55:08.570]  Can you grow it?
[55:08.610 --> 55:12.390]  I never thought about growing a mustard tree.
[55:12.910 --> 55:16.210]  It's like whenever I hear people growing food stuff like that, it's like,
[55:16.230 --> 55:17.690]  oh yeah, I got some rosemary in the back.
[55:17.770 --> 55:19.810]  I've never heard anyone be like, I gotta go get us some mustard.
[55:19.950 --> 55:20.530]  I'll be right back.
[55:21.190 --> 55:25.070]  It's just like... mustard is just like a little flower.
[55:25.310 --> 55:26.550]  It's like a nice looking little flower.
[55:26.670 --> 55:28.550]  Like if you told me that that's what you were growing,
[55:28.770 --> 55:29.790]  it would be like, oh, that's fine.
[55:30.250 --> 55:32.710]  Could you just have the petals on a dog, do you think?
[55:33.490 --> 55:35.430]  Would you get the same, like, peppery flavor?
[55:35.670 --> 55:37.770]  No, I don't think the petals...
[55:37.770 --> 55:41.610]  I don't think it's a Willy Wonka world where the petals taste like mustard.
[55:41.790 --> 55:43.210]  I think we gotta... I think we gotta give it a shot.
[55:43.450 --> 55:44.950]  I imagine they taste like petals.
[55:45.910 --> 55:46.970]  Uh, okay.
[55:48.210 --> 55:49.430]  Maybe. Let's find out.
[55:49.710 --> 55:51.470]  Why don't... this is what you have to do.
[55:51.850 --> 55:53.250]  This... this is the experiment.
[55:53.550 --> 55:57.730]  You have to blindfold Gavin and then you have three different hot dogs,
[55:57.730 --> 56:02.470]  each with petals on it, and he needs to be able to tell if he's having the mustard petals.
[56:02.590 --> 56:06.230]  Oh, that's good. One's like rose... one's like roses. This is good.
[56:06.630 --> 56:08.090]  Oh, I'd be able to do that instantly.
[56:08.490 --> 56:11.330]  There's no way that you'd be able to tell which one was the mustard petals.
[56:12.070 --> 56:14.110]  All right, mustard petal taste test, Eric.
[56:14.250 --> 56:14.510]  Right there.
[56:14.630 --> 56:15.410]  All right, yeah, I'm putting it on.
[56:15.410 --> 56:17.530]  Are you gonna put any other edible flowers?
[56:18.390 --> 56:19.850]  I think they're all... they all have to be edible.
[56:19.950 --> 56:21.170]  No, we're not gonna poison you.
[56:21.750 --> 56:22.970]  It's different edible flowers.
[56:23.490 --> 56:25.450]  So it could be a leaf or something like a mint?
[56:25.650 --> 56:27.030]  No, but it could be mint.
[56:27.030 --> 56:27.750]  It could be...
[56:31.070 --> 56:32.170]  What's another... basil?
[56:33.230 --> 56:34.290]  Could be parsley.
[56:35.050 --> 56:35.950]  Could be a tulip.
[56:36.250 --> 56:36.930]  Could be dill.
[56:37.370 --> 56:38.090]  Could be tulip.
[56:38.150 --> 56:38.930]  Could be rose.
[56:40.450 --> 56:41.730]  Some nice rose petals.
[56:43.050 --> 56:47.530]  I like the idea of you looking at rose petals on a hot dog and thinking it would taste like ketchup.
[56:47.810 --> 56:51.150]  Could be a hot dog made entirely out of Turkish delight,
[56:51.290 --> 56:53.870]  and the whole thing is set up to get you to eat Turkish delight.
[56:54.250 --> 56:55.030]  Wow.
[56:55.890 --> 56:58.070]  I don't know if I want to be blindfolded anymore.
[57:01.430 --> 57:03.990]  I think you'd be a real cool guy with an inner lip tattoo,
[57:04.150 --> 57:06.350]  eating mustard flower on your hot dogs.
[57:07.010 --> 57:08.150]  Oh, you know what'd be cool?
[57:08.330 --> 57:10.050]  If I... I gotta learn how to make this mustard,
[57:10.170 --> 57:13.490]  because sometimes mustard goes on deviled eggs, right?
[57:13.550 --> 57:14.470]  Or in deviled eggs.
[57:14.730 --> 57:17.230]  And we're gonna do that deviled egg eating competition
[57:17.230 --> 57:19.690]  where Gavin and Nick see who can eat the most deviled eggs,
[57:19.790 --> 57:21.510]  that I was gonna make all the deviled eggs.
[57:21.750 --> 57:24.070]  Maybe I'll make the mustard that goes in the deviled eggs,
[57:24.070 --> 57:25.210]  and then make the deviled eggs.
[57:25.670 --> 57:26.790]  I don't want to get sick though.
[57:27.650 --> 57:30.410]  You're not gonna get sick! I'm making good food, asshole!
[57:30.910 --> 57:33.930]  That sounds like I'm trying some first first attempt mustard here.
[57:34.210 --> 57:35.930]  No, no, no, no.
[57:36.010 --> 57:36.850]  Make... I'm gonna write this down.
[57:36.930 --> 57:37.450]  Make mustard.
[57:38.850 --> 57:42.850]  Make mustard to go in deviled egg off.
[57:43.130 --> 57:46.510]  What if we just put in a bag, or in the bit barrel,
[57:46.670 --> 57:48.310]  we put in all the condiments.
[57:49.210 --> 57:51.450]  And whatever you pull out, you have to make that one from scratch.
[57:51.810 --> 57:53.410]  Oh, ooh.
[57:53.410 --> 57:54.970]  And everyone has a different one.
[57:57.130 --> 57:58.050]  I like that.
[57:58.070 --> 58:01.550]  Can you look it up, or do you have to try to ponder how you even make it?
[58:01.590 --> 58:02.670]  I think you should be able to look it up.
[58:02.670 --> 58:03.550]  I think you can look it up.
[58:03.590 --> 58:03.810]  Yeah.
[58:04.630 --> 58:04.970]  Good.
[58:05.810 --> 58:08.710]  Because I'm still pondering vinegar here. I've got no idea.
[58:10.330 --> 58:12.150]  I don't... I don't know that you can...
[58:12.150 --> 58:15.330]  I don't know that you can like make vinegar in the time we're like trying to make a video.
[58:15.910 --> 58:17.530]  Yeah, I think you just use vinegar.
[58:17.930 --> 58:20.830]  I think vinegar is like a fermented fruit thing or whatever.
[58:21.210 --> 58:21.810]  Oh, fermentation!
[58:22.650 --> 58:22.930]  Yeah.
[58:22.930 --> 58:25.270]  That's probably the way it is.
[58:25.310 --> 58:26.950]  Yeah, because it's the...
[58:26.950 --> 58:27.010]  Yeah.
[58:27.610 --> 58:29.070]  What are we fermenting, though?
[58:29.290 --> 58:29.570]  Onion?
[58:30.710 --> 58:31.950]  Is it like onion water?
[58:32.530 --> 58:36.210]  No, no. I think it's like... I think it's just like grapes and stuff. I think it's just fruit.
[58:36.710 --> 58:37.910]  It's grapes and stuff?
[58:38.230 --> 58:43.150]  I think... I think it's like... I think vinegar is just a... it's just a fermentation process.
[58:43.790 --> 58:44.510]  From a grape?
[58:44.750 --> 58:47.450]  How many different liquids do grapes get?
[58:47.950 --> 58:48.910]  Like they're hogging everything.
[58:49.170 --> 58:49.530]  All right, here we go.
[58:49.530 --> 58:51.210]  They are. They're hogging everything. Yeah.
[58:51.410 --> 58:51.710]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:51.710 --> 58:56.390]  Vinegar is primarily made of acetic acid and water,
[58:56.610 --> 58:59.970]  with the acetic acid being produced through fermentation of alcohol.
[59:00.090 --> 59:03.130]  The alcohol, in turn, comes from various sources like fruit, grain,
[59:03.230 --> 59:05.570]  or even industrial alcohol, depending on the type of vinegar.
[59:05.570 --> 59:08.250]  Yeah, because I think it's a... it's like a wine offshoot, I think.
[59:09.270 --> 59:11.390]  It's a two-step fermentation process.
[59:11.490 --> 59:14.230]  So you can take fruit through alcohol into vinegar?
[59:14.990 --> 59:15.830]  I guess so, yeah.
[59:16.290 --> 59:17.610]  That's nuts. What happens after that?
[59:17.970 --> 59:18.990]  Because isn't that what they say?
[59:18.990 --> 59:22.230]  Like when people... like when alcohol goes bad, it turns into vinegar.
[59:24.890 --> 59:29.690]  You said that like you reach the end of the universe and learn that there's more.
[59:31.390 --> 59:32.290]  What's next?
[59:34.490 --> 59:37.130]  What happens if you leave vinegar for 25 years?
[59:37.990 --> 59:41.390]  I bet it gets... I bet it tastes really, really, really strong.
[59:42.030 --> 59:42.230]  Yeah.
[59:42.930 --> 59:44.710]  NFL is going to have to move to vinegar salt.
[59:45.510 --> 59:45.950]  Oof.
[59:47.030 --> 59:51.150]  You guys ever thought about doing like smelling salts before like some gaming stuff?
[59:52.110 --> 59:55.050]  I've done smelling salts before, but they're insane, dude.
[59:55.130 --> 59:55.250]  Yeah.
[59:55.350 --> 59:57.090]  We used to have them in the army. We used to fuck with people.
[59:57.590 --> 59:57.990]  What is it?
[59:58.650 --> 59:59.430]  Smelling salts?
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:02.410]  It's like...
[01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:04.730]  Is it drugs?
[01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:08.870]  No, no, no, no. It's like ammonia or something.
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:10.470]  Yeah, it's ammonia.
[01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.390]  Yeah, it's ammonia.
[01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:12.150]  Like concentrated.
[01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:13.530]  Oh, like cat piss?
[01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.030]  I don't think it's like cat piss.
[01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.350]  I just know it's like a really, really, really, really strong.
[01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:22.050]  It's like to smell so strong, it like wakes you up if you get like knocked out.
[01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:25.290]  And then people do it when it's time to hit like their max
[01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:30.230]  like PR stuff when like they're working out or they're about to go hit the field
[01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:31.490]  and they got to get all like amped up.
[01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:35.950]  And I thought about it just going on like Call of Duty and trying to beat like that one level.
[01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.250]  Maybe it's what you need.
[01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:39.610]  Gavin's office is a large smelling salt.
[01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.810]  I have been pretty amped in here recently.
[01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.130]  They just banned them in the NFL for this season.
[01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.470]  Oh, did they really? I didn't know that.
[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:56.110]  Yes. Out of concerns that players could use them to
[01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.130]  essentially get out of concussion protocol.
[01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:03.610]  Yes. Yeah. And then so that means there's like plenty for us to buy.
[01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.450]  That's true. Yeah.
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.630]  Ample supply are now out.
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:10.150]  Why would you want to get out of concussion protocol?
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:12.930]  If you want to get in there, coach says you got to play, baby.
[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:14.030]  You got to play, man.
[01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.770]  You want to play more than you want to like die more.
[01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:17.770]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.270]  Because every every game you're not playing,
[01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:24.130]  your replacement is proving that they can do the job that you just couldn't do.
[01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:24.710]  That's right.
[01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:26.730]  You're worried about losing your fucking career.
[01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.670]  I think it's also just a mindset of like, I'll be fine.
[01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:30.790]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.350]  Also, CTE is something that happens to other people, not me.
[01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:35.190]  Yep.
[01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.070]  Have you had a concussion, Andrew?
[01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.590]  Or is your head made of the same stuff as your nose?
[01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.770]  I don't think so. I don't think I've had a concussion.
[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:51.690]  What was interesting is when my mom was in the hospital for her ankle,
[01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:58.050]  one of the nurses was a the sister of somebody I went to elementary school with,
[01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.570]  and she recognized her and they were talking.
[01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:06.490]  And she brought up me and her response was, is that the kid that hurt his knee?
[01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:10.570]  Which I thought was interesting to know that that was my perception of elementary school.
[01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.110]  That was what I was known as, I guess.
[01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:18.950]  We're playing baseball using a lacrosse stick, like the pole part in the playground.
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.850]  And I hit a dinger. I hit a home run.
[01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:23.430]  I got real excited about it.
[01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:25.650]  And I went to sprint to what would have been first base.
[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:30.810]  And I was right next to the wooden barrier between the gravel part of the playground
[01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.710]  and like the cement on the side.
[01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:38.290]  And I tripped and I fell and I went knee first into the cement that had a bunch of
[01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.750]  those little gravel pieces that like parks have.
[01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:45.930]  And it like shredded my knee in a way that didn't hurt that bad,
[01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:50.030]  but looked really awful and like blood splattered everywhere.
[01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.610]  And all the kids got freaked out and I got sent home.
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:57.250]  So that's my legacy, I guess. I'm the kid that hurt his knee.
[01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.590]  Yeah, I would say similarly.
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:04.530]  My like worst injury to least pain ratio injury was on my knee.
[01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:05.330]  That's crazy.
[01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:06.430]  Really? Interesting.
[01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:09.850]  I've had so many concussions that the last one I got,
[01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:13.230]  a doctor told me that I had to stop getting concussions or I was going to die.
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.210]  Johnny Knoxville?
[01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:19.390]  He was like, you know, concussions are really bad for you, right?
[01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:19.990]  How many of you?
[01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:21.650]  And I was like, it was my fifth concussion.
[01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.110]  And he was like, you've got to stop doing this.
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:23.930]  You're not going to live long.
[01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.310]  And I was like, oh, I'm not trying to.
[01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:27.050]  How did you get the fifth one?
[01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.430]  I was in the army.
[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:31.230]  And so you already have five in your 20s?
[01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.450]  Yeah, I was in my 20s.
[01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:33.130]  Oh my God.
[01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:34.430]  I'm like 22 maybe.
[01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:39.450]  Yeah, I got hit by a baseball that knocked me out flat.
[01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.670]  Woke up in the emergency room, had a little bit of gray hair from that one.
[01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:48.410]  Fell off a half pipe on my head, went over the handlebars on a bike once.
[01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.230]  I think there's another one in there somewhere.
[01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.150]  And then anyway, the one that I...
[01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:55.370]  The last time I got a concussion is maybe the worst.
[01:03:55.690 --> 01:04:00.110]  I was pushing an AV cart in the army and it was like so fucking heavy.
[01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:06.270]  And I was like working it around a corner and I got kind of stuck.
[01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.810]  So I went around the other side to pull and I like wrenched it free and pulled.
[01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:11.710]  And so it's one of those things where you're like pulling a heavy cart towards you
[01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:15.070]  and it pushes into you.
[01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.530]  And as it was like pushing into me with momentum, I turned around
[01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:23.030]  and there was a stairwell and it was like the landing on the stairs like right above me.
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:28.650]  So it was like right like the line of where I guess began was right about my forehead height.
[01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:31.390]  It was just like under like if I had a duct, I would have just gone under it.
[01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:35.810]  And the cart pushed me, pushed my forehead into the stairs and I was fucking gone.
[01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:38.670]  Thrown up and just gone. That was rough.
[01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:39.470]  Brutal.
[01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:40.150]  Fuck.
[01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:41.470]  Wow.
[01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:43.470]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:47.510]  So you've done really well in the last couple of decades.
[01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.790]  I haven't had a concussion in over 20 years.
[01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:53.530]  You better start knocking on wood, bud. That's wild.
[01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.490]  Wow.
[01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:56.810]  I don't I don't want to get any more. That's for sure.
[01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:00.430]  No kidding. Well, we got to be gentle with you.
[01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:02.970]  From like 10 to 22, I was real rough on me.
[01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:04.370]  Yeah.
[01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:09.370]  So like that was like a 12. That was my 12 year concussion period. But I'm past that.
[01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:15.170]  I'm like, I'm floored. If you would have been like, oh, yeah, we were doing like immersion,
[01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:16.930]  it would have been like, oh, yeah, I wonder which one that was.
[01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:18.350]  You were like size 22.
[01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:25.910]  The only time I ever got hurt in my 22 year career at Rooster Teeth was on Does It Do?
[01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.350]  Ah, yes. Oh, that's right.
[01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:30.690]  Poor Tyler's staff.
[01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.330]  I know. I felt so bad for him.
[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:33.710]  Poor Tyler's staff.
[01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:36.170]  I was trying so hard. I put my hand behind my back.
[01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.830]  And I was like, let's wrap up. Let's keep filming.
[01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:39.470]  And they're like, why are you what's going what?
[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:40.870]  And I was like, it's fine.
[01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.310]  I was like, it's fine. We just keep filming.
[01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.250]  I was like, trying to wrap it up.
[01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:44.650]  And I'm like, it's going to be fine. We're going to get through it.
[01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:45.950]  And they were like, absolutely not.
[01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:48.730]  And then you huffed some smelling salts and you kept going.
[01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.830]  I've been having fun being at the office a lot recently.
[01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:55.850]  We've been doing a lot in there.
[01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.410]  Got the pinball machine moved.
[01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.810]  It's been great, man. This place rocks.
[01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:02.150]  Not by the front door anymore?
[01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:09.210]  No. I have found an excuse to go every day this week, and it has been just a delight.
[01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:14.730]  I'm going to have to probably come less because you've started going back to Achievement Hunter
[01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:15.050]  mode.
[01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.230]  We had a close call today.
[01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:19.950]  We had Andrew.
[01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.070]  We had a close call.
[01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:25.470]  We had an Achievement Hunter close call today.
[01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:27.390]  I'm sorry.
[01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.050]  I start with all the sprinklers off.
[01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:31.590]  No, we don't have sprinklers.
[01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:35.130]  I had a coffee on my desk.
[01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:38.710]  Well, iced coffee that Eric kindly got me from nearby.
[01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.370]  Gavin and I sit next to each other.
[01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:49.770]  I sit to his left, and I saw that coffee, and I shit you not, Andrew.
[01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:54.450]  I saw that coffee on his desk, and it was in front of his keyboard and the way he was sitting.
[01:06:54.930 --> 01:07:02.750]  And my hand reflexively, I got into a backhand motion, and I was reflexively about to, like,
[01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.110]  I wasn't even thinking.
[01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:08.690]  I was just in autopilot mode, and I was about to whack it to see if I could hit the ground.
[01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:11.790]  The coffee into his keyboard and then all the way down into his lap.
[01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:13.410]  And I was like, what do you do?
[01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:13.910]  I saw my hand.
[01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:14.970]  I was like, what are you doing?
[01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:16.370]  And I stopped myself.
[01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:17.790]  And I was like, no, don't.
[01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.130]  And then I told him what I'd almost done.
[01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:20.810]  But it was real close, man.
[01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:24.250]  I if I wasn't paying enough, if I wasn't paying attention, I would have done it.
[01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:27.330]  Maybe you're not a menace, and it's just you have cat-like reflexes.
[01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:29.190]  No, I think I'm a cat move.
[01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:30.690]  Just swiping a thing on the thing.
[01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.090]  I think I'm a menace.
[01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:35.390]  It's like there was a movie a couple of years.
[01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:37.530]  I remember a horror movie where a guy got like a hand.
[01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.150]  He got decapitated and he got his decapitated.
[01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.670]  He got his arm cut off and he got like a new arm.
[01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.210]  But the arm was evil from a serial killer.
[01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.970]  And it would do stuff and hurt people.
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:49.010]  And he had no control over it.
[01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:51.730]  I have like I have like a dickhead hand.
[01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:57.210]  I just have like a hand that is a menace.
[01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:59.130]  It's that I don't have any control over.
[01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:02.710]  It belongs to you when you are 20, but you've still got it.
[01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:07.170]  I've got two 20-year-old hands in a 50-year-old's body.
[01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.610]  And I just I don't know what to do about it.
[01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.690]  I forgot what it's like to be in the office.
[01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:17.250]  Just like in your vicinity, but not necessarily working on something.
[01:08:17.410 --> 01:08:22.530]  The other day I was under the desk trying to like we rewire some of the networking stuff
[01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:25.330]  just so we all have our own like full gigabit connection.
[01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:26.390]  And I'm unplugging stuff.
[01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:29.570]  And then it's like moving ethernet cables around.
[01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:32.750]  And then suddenly from above, because I'm under the desk,
[01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.070]  all I hear is like SLAM! SLAM! SLAM!
[01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:36.090]  It's like nothing works.
[01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:40.230]  But and I guess I unplugged your Xbox Jeff or something.
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.890]  And then you getting annoyed at that and slamming the table.
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:48.390]  Then somehow like unplugged your HDMI from your monitor.
[01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:51.410]  And you were just getting more and more annoyed.
[01:08:51.610 --> 01:08:54.330]  Just smacking everything and breaking everything.
[01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:58.050]  As it was just it was like a cascading effect that went beyond my control.
[01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.370]  It was a full day of Jeff having tech problems.
[01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.490]  And the shit just kept rolling downhill.
[01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.770]  And that meant some keyboards were getting slammed around on some desks.
[01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:09.070]  You smashed your spacebar off, which is great.
[01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:10.670]  I think we've had that keyboard for a month.
[01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:14.910]  And all you need to do is just wait for it to come back on.
[01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:18.090]  I had to rewire like half your shit because you'd loosen it all.
[01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:21.830]  I put the keyboard's spacebar back on.
[01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:22.830]  It's back on, it works.
[01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:24.970]  Yeah, I got real mad for a second.
[01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:28.490]  I was just under the table just like, all right, chill out.
[01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:30.430]  Shit stopped working in the middle of something.
[01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:31.950]  Suddenly stuff's not working.
[01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:34.230]  And then I dropped my controller on the ground wide.
[01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:35.890]  Threw my controller on the ground or whatever.
[01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:38.970]  And it made my monitor stop working.
[01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:43.090]  It was like a Rube Goldberg of shit.
[01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:44.470]  Oh, man.
[01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:46.850]  Gavin, did you see that Rube Goldberg I sent you the other day?
[01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:47.570]  The video?
[01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:49.590]  Yeah, that was great.
[01:09:51.610 --> 01:09:52.350]  Oh, man.
[01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:56.790]  You make it sound like I'm some sort of an angry tyrant,
[01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.330]  but it was all done in a playing loving way.
[01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:01.290]  Oh, yeah, it was like tongue in cheek.
[01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:06.110]  But then you actually broke stuff for real that I had to fix and you were genuinely annoyed.
[01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.050]  Well, yeah, because I broke stuff.
[01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:10.130]  But I was mad at myself, not you.
[01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:16.510]  Yeah, I guess I've never worked in the same office as you where I'm IT and tech support.
[01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.170]  So it's a slightly different experience.
[01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:24.450]  It's fun, though.
[01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.830]  It's so much fun.
[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.470]  I really am having a blast.
[01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:29.150]  We need some new drinks, though.
[01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:29.850]  We're low on drinks.
[01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:33.530]  Have we talked about the awesome trash can that we got at work?
[01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.990]  I don't think so.
[01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:37.390]  Uh, no, I really I don't I don't think so.
[01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:41.690]  I don't think we got to release that video of Eric with the trash can on social.
[01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:42.510]  You do.
[01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.430]  It is very good today.
[01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.810]  Instant classic, instant classic.
[01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:49.150]  We we when we went to El Famoso for the hot dog,
[01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:56.230]  Thursday that they had, we were taken aback, Eric and I, because in their break room,
[01:10:56.290 --> 01:11:02.710]  they had one of those trash cans with the swinging thank you door that you put the trash in that they
[01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:05.990]  have at fast food restaurants like they have at Wendy's or McDonald's.
[01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:09.070]  And we were like, how the fuck did you guys get that?
[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:12.710]  And Natalie was like, we we have a hookup or whatever.
[01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.430]  And we're like, could we get your hookup?
[01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:15.170]  And then it fell through.
[01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:19.650]  But we just bought one on a Granger or one of those like industrial websites.
[01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.490]  And we finally put it together.
[01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:24.010]  And it is the coolest fucking thing in the world.
[01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.730]  It looks like a lot of fun.
[01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:27.750]  Our kitchen looks like a Burger King now.
[01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:32.110]  And if we wanted to put up that video on social tomorrow, is that all right, Eric?
[01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:32.870]  Or have we missed it?
[01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.510]  Oh, you can just tell me when you want it up.
[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:39.630]  I can put together a thumbnail.
[01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:44.730]  Oh, yeah, that's just tell me when you want it up.
[01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.570]  And then when it's about to go up, you can change your mind.
[01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:47.210]  That's up to you.
[01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:48.830]  I didn't change my mind.
[01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:49.250]  What do you mean?
[01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:49.870]  Okay.
[01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.750]  Well, what what did I change?
[01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:53.190]  No, it's fine.
[01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:54.230]  Yeah, you just let me know when you want it up.
[01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:55.630]  Should I end the episode?
[01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:58.370]  Whenever you want it up, you just say.
[01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:01.170]  Well, I just need to know.
[01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:02.650]  Before regulation.
[01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.630]  Check the calendar.
[01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:04.150]  It should be there.
[01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.390]  Like which days are ahead of this one?
[01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:07.030]  Which days already?
[01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:08.710]  Yeah, just have a look on the calendar.
[01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:12.670]  Anytime you have a question, just have a look at that calendar, dude.
[01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:15.410]  Check your most updated screenshot of a calendar.
[01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:16.530]  Yeah, just check out that calendar.
[01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:17.950]  You just let me know what day you want it up.
[01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.390]  We'll put it up.
[01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:18.830]  No problem.
[01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:20.330]  I'm telling you whatever day you want, man.
[01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:24.490]  Okay, try to keep going.
[01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:25.630]  Just keep fighting through it.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:26.150]  All right.
[01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:30.690]  Well, before we before regulation, the regulation company disintegrates in front of us all.
[01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:34.770]  This has been episode 66 of the regulation podcast.
[01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.570]  We hope you liked it.
[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:37.670]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:39.190]  This one was in rehearsals for a week.
[01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:40.350]  We did dress rehearsals.
[01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:44.150]  We did like four different readthroughs of the script.
[01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:46.390]  But I really feel like we nailed it this week.
[01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:48.710]  Hopefully you agreed with us.
[01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:52.350]  And we got to we got to get to writing because we got a whole new script to come up with for 67.
[01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:54.090]  We still in season one of regulation era?
[01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.530]  Oh, no, I think we're in season two.
[01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:57.910]  Okay, season two.
[01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:59.750]  I felt like it was still pretty season one-ish.
[01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:01.670]  I mean, should we do we vote?
[01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:03.530]  Did we not declare at the end of season two?
[01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:04.230]  I thought we did.
[01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:04.990]  I thought we did too.
[01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.790]  On the one year mark.
[01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:06.290]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.450]  I think we did at the one year mark.
[01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:08.370]  Okay, so we're in season two.
[01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.170]  Yeah, but Gavin's got some decisions to make about it.
[01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:10.770]  Don't worry.
[01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:11.930]  He'll let us know later.
[01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:16.470]  Gavin, go ahead and get those notes to us on that decision we made four months ago.
[01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:17.590]  Now that it's done.
[01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:18.170]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.750]  Now's the time.
[01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:19.890]  Appreciate it.
