[00:01.020 --> 00:07.620]  The summer sun hums, and all you crave is something cold and crisp, so you pour it.

[00:30.160 --> 00:33.160]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:33.420 --> 00:34.980]  This is episode 66.
[00:35.680 --> 00:36.360]  My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:36.420 --> 00:40.080]  With me, as always, Andrew Patton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[00:40.720 --> 00:40.880]  Hello.
[00:41.320 --> 00:41.680]  Hello.
[00:42.600 --> 00:43.060]  All right.
[00:43.100 --> 00:43.900]  A couple of orders of business.
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.620]  One, I have two questions that are very important that I ask you guys this week that keep getting
[00:47.620 --> 00:47.960]  pushed.
[00:48.580 --> 00:53.660]  Also, we have about seven draft ideas we need to go over and make sure we're all on the
[00:53.660 --> 00:55.160]  same page about so we can schedule those.
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.920]  And we should probably mention that the Gerbler launch happened.
[01:00.500 --> 01:00.860]  Yes.
[01:01.180 --> 01:05.460]  And it was, I think, we can say, a success.
[01:05.980 --> 01:06.500]  Absolutely.
[01:07.280 --> 01:07.480]  Yeah.
[01:07.540 --> 01:10.660]  It was 10,000 in 12 hours, is that right?
[01:11.100 --> 01:11.380]  Yeah.
[01:11.820 --> 01:17.620]  Which means people had essentially a waking day to log in at their leisure and get a Gerbler
[01:17.620 --> 01:18.100]  or two.
[01:18.520 --> 01:21.460]  What if next time, 11,000?
[01:23.260 --> 01:24.800]  What if next time, 9,000?
[01:25.500 --> 01:25.780]  Why?
[01:25.920 --> 01:26.520]  No, too low.
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.740]  Oh, I'm just kind of given like, you know, six and one half dozen.
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.480]  I'm kind of going just like the other way to see.
[01:30.820 --> 01:31.060]  All right.
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.600]  I'll meet you guys in the middle of 10K.
[01:32.740 --> 01:33.200]  All right.
[01:33.260 --> 01:34.240]  Hey, I think that's good.
[01:35.480 --> 01:36.740]  No, I think we learned a lot, though.
[01:36.780 --> 01:40.560]  We're definitely going to increase the Kuesler output when we make more of those.
[01:40.620 --> 01:44.020]  We need to increase the combo patch deal when we do that.
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.900]  We definitely need more patch shirts.
[01:46.020 --> 01:46.680]  There's a lot of...
[01:46.680 --> 01:50.080]  We got a lot of really good, interesting information from the sale.
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.100]  And I think we are getting really close to being dialed in on the amount of Gerblers.
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.260]  People have asked in the comments if we were going to be re-releasing this Gerbler.
[02:01.060 --> 02:03.220]  Like most Gerblers, no plans to do that.
[02:03.360 --> 02:08.440]  We already began work on a new Gerbler that should be out later in the year, and it'll
[02:08.440 --> 02:09.040]  be different.
[02:09.320 --> 02:11.420]  It'll be new and a different idea.
[02:11.820 --> 02:15.500]  Most of all, from the merch drop, thank you so much to everybody who showed up and supported
[02:15.500 --> 02:15.820]  us.
[02:16.020 --> 02:16.380]  Absolutely.
[02:16.680 --> 02:17.140]  We appreciate it so much.
[02:17.660 --> 02:20.620]  We continue to be blown away by your support.
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.040]  Just happy that we also didn't frustrate you and annoy you by selling out too fast this
[02:25.040 --> 02:25.240]  time.
[02:25.620 --> 02:28.880]  Especially everyone who made it for the stream, for the actual... the drop.
[02:29.500 --> 02:30.220]  Yeah, that was really cool.
[02:30.780 --> 02:33.500]  2v2 Mario Party, I love.
[02:34.120 --> 02:34.640]  That's...
[02:34.640 --> 02:37.620]  What a fun, different way to play that game.
[02:37.820 --> 02:38.940]  I love watching that.
[02:39.260 --> 02:43.460]  As a member of the only undefeated 2v2 Mario team, I tend to agree with you.
[02:44.480 --> 02:45.460]  Good old Team G.
[02:46.000 --> 02:46.360]  Team G.
[02:48.440 --> 02:49.580]  Classic Team G, baby.
[02:52.060 --> 02:52.700]  Oh, Christ.
[02:53.040 --> 02:54.880]  Does anybody else have anything they want to talk about this week?
[02:54.960 --> 02:55.780]  Any orders of business?
[02:55.820 --> 02:57.500]  Well, I think we need to get to your questions.
[02:57.740 --> 02:58.820]  You said that they keep getting pushed.
[02:59.100 --> 03:00.280]  Let's go right into your questions.
[03:01.100 --> 03:03.540]  Hopefully these will inspire a little bit of conversation.
[03:03.660 --> 03:06.840]  The first question I have, I thought about this the other couple weeks ago.
[03:07.540 --> 03:10.180]  What is your favorite color to drink?
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.840]  And it can't be clear.
[03:13.980 --> 03:14.880]  Because of Gavin.
[03:15.440 --> 03:16.380]  Oh, I see.
[03:16.800 --> 03:18.260]  Uh, I'm trying to think here.
[03:18.380 --> 03:23.000]  Immediately what comes to mind is orange.
[03:23.760 --> 03:24.240]  Okay.
[03:24.660 --> 03:26.740]  I enjoy orange drinks, generally.
[03:27.660 --> 03:30.740]  What about, though, because I like apple drinks quite a bit.
[03:30.760 --> 03:33.160]  I'm trying to weigh if I like orange more than apple drinks.
[03:33.740 --> 03:35.700]  Do you ever get surprised by a drink?
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.400]  Oh, all the time.
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.560]  I feel like most drinks that look like piss are actually quite good.
[03:42.200 --> 03:42.340]  Yeah.
[03:42.360 --> 03:42.600]  Yeah?
[03:42.600 --> 03:42.900]  Yeah.
[03:42.900 --> 03:45.220]  Like pineapple looks like piss, but it tastes delicious.
[03:45.560 --> 03:45.960]  Yeah.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.060]  And like apple juice often looks pretty pissy.
[03:49.440 --> 03:51.500]  What color would you say coffee is?
[03:51.540 --> 03:52.400]  Are we calling it brown?
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.040]  Brown.
[03:53.480 --> 03:53.800]  Okay.
[03:53.920 --> 03:54.900]  That's my answer.
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.180]  I would say coffee, tea, and sodas all fall in the brown category.
[03:59.540 --> 03:59.760]  Yeah.
[03:59.760 --> 04:00.340]  You get Coke.
[04:00.440 --> 04:01.040]  You get root beer.
[04:01.640 --> 04:01.840]  Yeah.
[04:02.200 --> 04:04.460]  I think if I can't pick clear, I'm going to say white.
[04:06.120 --> 04:06.820]  What's white?
[04:06.880 --> 04:07.140]  Milk?
[04:07.140 --> 04:07.480]  What's white?
[04:07.620 --> 04:07.840]  Milk?
[04:08.300 --> 04:08.560]  No.
[04:08.820 --> 04:11.100]  Maybe like an electrolyte drink of some sort.
[04:11.100 --> 04:11.280]  Whoa.
[04:11.580 --> 04:12.580]  Like a white Gatorade.
[04:12.720 --> 04:12.860]  Yeah.
[04:13.000 --> 04:13.620]  Those are pretty good.
[04:13.820 --> 04:14.220]  Yeah.
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.280]  Like a glacier ice or something.
[04:16.440 --> 04:18.440]  You get glacier ice and milk.
[04:18.980 --> 04:19.800]  Those are your two choices.
[04:19.800 --> 04:20.720]  What a one-two.
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.620]  I only use milk.
[04:25.680 --> 04:27.320]  I never just go for a glass of milk, you know?
[04:27.780 --> 04:28.100]  Sure.
[04:29.140 --> 04:30.020]  I think that's fair.
[04:30.360 --> 04:35.180]  I figured, I expected, I mean, I kind of had an idea that Gavin would immediately try to
[04:35.180 --> 04:38.660]  say clear and Eric would say brown, but I'm surprised red didn't come up.
[04:38.780 --> 04:40.780]  That seems to be like the go-to for most people.
[04:40.780 --> 04:43.900]  I've been polling people in my life and almost everybody has said red.
[04:44.160 --> 04:45.940]  Red can swing in a lot of different ways.
[04:46.040 --> 04:51.300]  You're either getting cherry or like a strawberry and there's a lot of variation in fake cherry.
[04:51.680 --> 04:52.400]  Cherry's good.
[04:52.700 --> 04:53.440]  Strawberry's good.
[04:53.740 --> 04:54.400]  Watermelon's good.
[04:54.580 --> 04:57.080]  Fruit punch is just a combination of those and is good.
[04:57.360 --> 05:01.840]  I definitely don't ever pick up red and go like, oh, what about blue Razz?
[05:02.500 --> 05:06.800]  Oh, well, I haven't gone yet, but my answer is blue.
[05:07.240 --> 05:09.920]  I think blue is my favorite color to drink.
[05:10.300 --> 05:10.540]  Yeah.
[05:11.600 --> 05:14.780]  There's just not a lot of blue drinks that immediately come to mind to me.
[05:15.580 --> 05:20.500]  There's like three different blue Gatorades and Powerades that I absolutely love.
[05:21.100 --> 05:22.060]  There's blue Razz.
[05:22.500 --> 05:23.900]  Is there any new high voltage?
[05:24.740 --> 05:25.400]  There you go.
[05:25.840 --> 05:29.760]  Is there any fruit that produces a naturally blue juice?
[05:30.520 --> 05:30.840]  Oh.
[05:31.340 --> 05:34.220]  Because blue might be the most unnatural liquid color to drink.
[05:34.460 --> 05:37.460]  I mean, even though everything's dye anyway, it's just like, what's blue?
[05:37.540 --> 05:38.920]  I feel like we talked about this.
[05:38.920 --> 05:43.120]  Have we talked about this in like a previous episode of like, what's like the most unnatural
[05:43.120 --> 05:43.840]  food color?
[05:44.480 --> 05:47.260]  And I feel like blue is like the thing we landed on like a long time ago.
[05:47.660 --> 05:49.420]  What color would blueberries are like?
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.340]  They're like purple.
[05:50.360 --> 05:50.660]  Purple.
[05:50.840 --> 05:51.140]  I feel like.
[05:51.220 --> 05:51.340]  Yeah.
[05:51.540 --> 05:51.940]  Hmm.
[05:52.800 --> 05:53.620]  Like a dark purple.
[05:54.220 --> 05:54.720]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[05:54.720 --> 05:55.960]  Kiwi is like murky white.
[05:56.780 --> 05:57.080]  Oh.
[05:57.520 --> 05:57.840]  Really?
[05:58.340 --> 05:59.080]  I think so.
[05:59.320 --> 06:00.640]  That's what, at least in my head.
[06:01.000 --> 06:01.600]  You said kiwi?
[06:02.100 --> 06:02.320]  Yeah.
[06:02.400 --> 06:02.620]  Kiwi.
[06:03.240 --> 06:04.280]  How would kiwi not be green?
[06:05.180 --> 06:05.780]  Is it green?
[06:05.780 --> 06:08.440]  I feel like it's a very light green if it is green.
[06:08.800 --> 06:10.140]  It's not like a bright green.
[06:10.800 --> 06:12.140]  It's a very bright green.
[06:12.320 --> 06:13.820]  Isn't kiwi like the brightest green?
[06:14.020 --> 06:14.500]  Kiwi's like.
[06:15.440 --> 06:15.800]  Yeah.
[06:15.920 --> 06:16.400]  What are you?
[06:16.620 --> 06:17.080]  What are you?
[06:17.240 --> 06:17.760]  No, no, no, no.
[06:17.800 --> 06:18.460]  The juice.
[06:18.600 --> 06:19.060]  The juice.
[06:19.100 --> 06:21.800]  If you squeeze the juice of a kiwi, I don't think it's bright green.
[06:22.500 --> 06:23.180]  Well, we should find out.
[06:23.240 --> 06:25.760]  Well, now we've got to start juicing shit and see if it matches.
[06:26.420 --> 06:28.680]  We got to juice a fucking kiwi now.
[06:29.300 --> 06:30.020]  I don't.
[06:30.320 --> 06:30.460]  I don't.
[06:30.560 --> 06:30.900]  That's good.
[06:30.920 --> 06:32.740]  You're telling me that's going to make white juice.
[06:32.920 --> 06:33.780]  I still don't understand.
[06:33.980 --> 06:34.240]  I just.
[06:34.240 --> 06:34.980]  Oh.
[06:36.260 --> 06:38.100]  I mean, that's.
[06:38.340 --> 06:39.140]  Yeah, it's green.
[06:39.520 --> 06:44.000]  As I said, that's how I pictured it in my mind, which is not.
[06:44.180 --> 06:45.560]  I'm not saying that was factual.
[06:45.600 --> 06:47.120]  That's just how I envisioned it.
[06:47.520 --> 06:47.720]  Yeah.
[06:47.800 --> 06:50.180]  It's greener than it looks in my head.
[06:50.680 --> 06:51.840]  Do you eat the hair on a kiwi?
[06:52.600 --> 06:53.480]  I have.
[06:54.420 --> 06:56.740]  I prefer not to, but I have tried.
[06:57.920 --> 07:02.120]  I thought I wouldn't like it, but it turns out it makes almost no impact on the taste.
[07:02.780 --> 07:03.540]  You're crazy.
[07:03.540 --> 07:05.880]  Do you think you might like eating other hair?
[07:06.180 --> 07:07.340]  You just haven't realized it yet?
[07:07.880 --> 07:11.560]  I would say if of all the hair that I eat, kiwi hair is probably the best.
[07:12.380 --> 07:15.180]  It adds a huge difference to taste, in my opinion.
[07:15.480 --> 07:15.960]  Really?
[07:16.540 --> 07:16.840]  Yeah.
[07:17.440 --> 07:18.500]  I think it's completely different.
[07:19.140 --> 07:21.360]  It's like you put a rug on your food.
[07:21.520 --> 07:22.940]  So we got.
[07:23.420 --> 07:29.420]  We officially we got Eric down for brown, Gavin is white, and that figures.
[07:30.600 --> 07:32.920]  Andrew likes yellow or orange.
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.160]  It sounds like.
[07:34.560 --> 07:35.880]  And Nick and I are both blue boys.
[07:36.260 --> 07:36.740]  Yeah, blue.
[07:36.980 --> 07:37.380]  All right.
[07:37.640 --> 07:38.220]  All right.
[07:38.220 --> 07:38.840]  Blue is pretty good.
[07:39.780 --> 07:40.140]  Interesting.
[07:40.520 --> 07:42.900]  I feel like I can be persuaded in a lot of different ways.
[07:43.480 --> 07:44.360]  Plus Pepsi blue.
[07:44.540 --> 07:44.940]  Remember that?
[07:45.040 --> 07:45.200]  Yeah.
[07:45.260 --> 07:45.780]  Pepsi blue.
[07:46.620 --> 07:46.980]  Purple.
[07:47.580 --> 07:48.500]  Limited, but good.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.500]  I was trying to think the other day of, you know, like how Andrew, you've never had an
[07:52.500 --> 07:54.540]  egg and some other basic foods and stuff.
[07:54.620 --> 07:58.100]  I was trying to think of the most basic food that I've never had.
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.360]  Big blue.
[07:59.860 --> 08:00.620]  Oh, big blue.
[08:00.620 --> 08:02.660]  Is that is that the same company as Big Red?
[08:03.060 --> 08:03.660]  Yes, it is.
[08:03.680 --> 08:06.160]  Oh, I would like big blue way more than big red, I think.
[08:06.440 --> 08:07.140]  Yeah, it is.
[08:07.200 --> 08:07.500]  It's better.
[08:08.040 --> 08:09.680]  What is the most basic food you haven't had, Gavin?
[08:10.060 --> 08:15.360]  I think the most the food that I've passed by the most without eating is spam.
[08:15.980 --> 08:16.840]  Oh, OK.
[08:17.500 --> 08:18.860]  I've never gone for spam.
[08:19.000 --> 08:20.560]  I don't even really know what it is.
[08:21.020 --> 08:23.300]  I assume it's just like pig offal.
[08:23.380 --> 08:24.420]  It's processed meat.
[08:24.640 --> 08:24.860]  Can't.
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.420]  Didn't we have a conversation recently, Gav, about doing a new show where we what was it
[08:30.420 --> 08:30.840]  called?
[08:30.860 --> 08:31.620]  What do we call it?
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.660]  I think it was you that I talked to or where we talked about doing this very thing.
[08:36.800 --> 08:37.600]  I think it was me.
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.280]  And it was like first timers or something like first timers club or something.
[08:42.620 --> 08:42.740]  Yeah.
[08:42.880 --> 08:44.320]  And it was like, we do.
[08:44.560 --> 08:49.540]  We correct mistakes in our lives that like Gavin having never tried spam, Andrew never
[08:49.540 --> 08:54.520]  having an egg, me never trying, I don't know, whatever, some milk shit I've never had.
[08:57.020 --> 09:00.400]  And it's like we just like with all the things that we should have done that we've never
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.580]  done, we we create a list and it's like like a bucket list of things that we should have
[09:05.580 --> 09:06.980]  done at this point in our lives that we haven't.
[09:07.320 --> 09:09.860]  So it's like a bucket list of of cherry pops.
[09:10.900 --> 09:11.220]  Exactly.
[09:11.340 --> 09:11.500]  Yeah.
[09:11.760 --> 09:12.040]  Yeah.
[09:12.240 --> 09:12.420]  Yeah.
[09:12.520 --> 09:12.580]  Yeah.
[09:12.640 --> 09:13.440]  That's a good way to put it.
[09:13.500 --> 09:14.840]  A bucket list of cherry pops.
[09:14.960 --> 09:15.100]  Yeah.
[09:17.920 --> 09:18.280]  Horrific.
[09:18.940 --> 09:19.980]  Horrific way to put it.
[09:20.040 --> 09:26.820]  This is a we had to talk last episode about things that I prefer when free or that I think
[09:26.820 --> 09:27.760]  are only good when free.
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.580]  I compiled a little bit of list that we could go over a lot of food on that list.
[09:32.660 --> 09:35.260]  Surprisingly, this is what I have so far.
[09:36.220 --> 09:45.300]  Things I only like when free melon, sausage links, mints, suckers, toothbrushes, spinach,
[09:46.100 --> 09:53.500]  raspberry, anything behind a ticket counter, samples, Mark Wahlberg movies, getting feet
[09:53.500 --> 09:55.100]  measured, potato skins.
[09:56.140 --> 09:56.580]  Wait.
[09:57.720 --> 09:58.920]  Things I only like when free.
[09:59.680 --> 10:01.640]  Who's ever paid to get their feet measured?
[10:02.500 --> 10:03.220]  That's a good point.
[10:03.720 --> 10:04.260]  That's fair.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.780]  It's just the thing I would never pay for, I guess, was the thing I thought of.
[10:10.660 --> 10:11.580]  I like health care.
[10:12.880 --> 10:13.540]  That's a good one.
[10:14.100 --> 10:15.080]  Health care is a good one.
[10:15.180 --> 10:15.840]  That is a good one.
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.460]  But that's good just generally.
[10:19.120 --> 10:20.240]  Health care is great.
[10:20.780 --> 10:21.800]  Health care and necessity.
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.880]  These are things that I only enjoy when free or that I would only opt for if free.
[10:27.300 --> 10:28.660]  What do you mean sausage links?
[10:29.520 --> 10:30.500]  Like sausage links.
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.520]  So you would never buy a toothbrush?
[10:35.380 --> 10:40.460]  I wouldn't be excited about buying a toothbrush, but if I get given one for free, I'm happy
[10:40.460 --> 10:40.860]  about it.
[10:40.960 --> 10:41.560]  But I would never.
[10:41.720 --> 10:43.220]  I'm never excited about getting one.
[10:43.420 --> 10:44.860]  Not even an electric one?
[10:45.040 --> 10:46.460]  Oh, a sausage link is a sausage.
[10:47.080 --> 10:47.280]  Yeah.
[10:47.580 --> 10:47.760]  Yeah.
[10:47.860 --> 10:48.560]  Sausage link.
[10:48.700 --> 10:50.140]  Instead of a instead of a patty or a crumble.
[10:52.480 --> 10:53.460]  Big fan of the patty.
[10:54.420 --> 10:55.380]  I'm a big fan of patty too.
[10:56.140 --> 10:58.040]  That's the default sausage though, that picture.
[10:58.200 --> 10:58.680]  That's sausage.
[10:59.300 --> 11:01.800]  That's one of the ways that a person can eat sausage, yeah.
[11:01.960 --> 11:08.180]  I would say that it's sausage there, and then there's sausage patties as like the side thing.
[11:09.220 --> 11:12.720]  I think what you're learning is that you just don't know what a sausage link is.
[11:12.800 --> 11:14.260]  It's an unfamiliar term to you.
[11:16.040 --> 11:17.840]  That's like calling it a melon fruit.
[11:18.100 --> 11:18.980]  We know it's a fruit.
[11:18.980 --> 11:20.400]  No, but it's a link.
[11:21.000 --> 11:21.820]  That's the link.
[11:21.940 --> 11:22.020]  Yeah.
[11:22.060 --> 11:23.500]  It's unlinked.
[11:23.500 --> 11:24.080]  It's not.
[11:25.320 --> 11:27.900]  Oh, do you think you could make a sausage chain?
[11:28.120 --> 11:32.840]  So do you think a chain, the links in a chain when they're unlinked, stop being links?
[11:33.940 --> 11:37.280]  Uh, well, link in a chain is closed off, isn't it?
[11:37.660 --> 11:40.060]  Yeah, but these were two and connected at some point.
[11:40.140 --> 11:41.020]  They've been cut apart.
[11:42.680 --> 11:45.540]  I don't think Gavin understands sausage at all.
[11:47.040 --> 11:48.160]  Sausage is the shape.
[11:48.740 --> 11:49.640]  It's sausage.
[11:50.080 --> 11:51.220]  Like if you, a sausage dog.
[11:51.420 --> 11:51.980]  There's sausage links.
[11:52.240 --> 11:52.480]  Okay.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.180]  Sausage is the ingredient.
[11:54.340 --> 11:58.000]  The link is the method it's being delivered to you by.
[11:58.560 --> 12:00.240]  Link or patty or crumble.
[12:01.140 --> 12:01.460]  Exactly.
[12:01.500 --> 12:04.260]  Hell, if anything, crumble I think would be the most pure sausage.
[12:04.900 --> 12:06.060]  Just the inside stuff.
[12:06.220 --> 12:10.320]  I just think if something's like a sausage or sausagey, it's that exact shape.
[12:10.900 --> 12:12.540]  I think that could apply to anything.
[12:12.660 --> 12:14.640]  I just, it's what your preference is.
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.920]  So, so when you called me many times in the past, a silly sausage, that's what you were
[12:20.920 --> 12:21.440]  referring to?
[12:21.560 --> 12:22.480]  Me in link form?
[12:23.100 --> 12:23.300]  Yeah.
[12:23.500 --> 12:24.040]  I mean, you could.
[12:24.180 --> 12:25.180]  Yeah, I think so.
[12:25.480 --> 12:26.560]  That's what I was envisioning.
[12:27.900 --> 12:32.080]  What's strange about this conversation is Gavin is, is articulating it in a way that
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.880]  someone is wrong when all he's doing is stating his perception of this thing.
[12:36.240 --> 12:36.600]  Absolutely.
[12:36.980 --> 12:37.960]  Oh, sausage patty.
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.380]  Oh, there's some good patties.
[12:39.980 --> 12:43.460]  So that, would you say that's more the base sausage than the link?
[12:43.920 --> 12:44.320]  No.
[12:44.840 --> 12:47.420]  No, I think the link is the most common, but it's just called a sausage.
[12:48.320 --> 12:48.480]  Yeah.
[12:48.540 --> 12:51.980]  A sausage link is the most common distribution method for sausage, I would say.
[12:52.300 --> 12:52.660]  Yeah.
[12:53.120 --> 12:53.660]  By far.
[12:54.440 --> 12:55.080]  Those are my list.
[12:55.440 --> 12:59.600]  Potato skins, best tasting item, way too expensive on menus.
[13:00.020 --> 13:01.480]  What do you mean by samples?
[13:02.820 --> 13:08.200]  Like if you go into a grocery store and they're handing out samples, I'm always going to like
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.200]  the thing on sample, but I will never enjoy it as much as I do in that context.
[13:12.780 --> 13:15.560]  If I buy the product and take it home, it will not be as good.
[13:16.320 --> 13:16.680]  Interesting.
[13:17.040 --> 13:17.400]  Huh.
[13:17.680 --> 13:19.020]  I thought of another question.
[13:19.320 --> 13:19.560]  Okay.
[13:19.720 --> 13:20.660]  I have three questions.
[13:20.760 --> 13:21.560]  I only asked you guys one.
[13:22.380 --> 13:23.100]  Next question.
[13:23.660 --> 13:27.200]  Do you guys think, this isn't the one I just thought of, this was the, I had already thought
[13:27.200 --> 13:27.500]  of this one.
[13:27.800 --> 13:27.920]  Okay.
[13:28.320 --> 13:33.180]  Do you guys think that anyone's ever, I was buying bread the other day, right?
[13:33.220 --> 13:36.840]  I was looking at a loaf of Wonder Bread and I was just thinking about how much, is there
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.620]  like a standard amount of slices of bread in a loaf?
[13:40.620 --> 13:43.900]  And I was like, well, I could count and then see if it's the same as like the butter.
[13:44.020 --> 13:44.880]  And I was like, this is stupid.
[13:44.940 --> 13:45.700]  I'm not going to do this.
[13:45.960 --> 13:48.860]  But I was just thinking about like a loaf of bread's a lot of bread, you know, just
[13:48.860 --> 13:50.280]  like a regular ass loaf of white bread.
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.860]  And that got me thinking, do you think anybody has ever made one sandwich out of an entire
[13:54.860 --> 13:55.760]  loaf of bread?
[13:56.780 --> 13:57.200]  Oh God.
[13:57.520 --> 14:00.900]  Like if you had an uncut loaf and then carved it and put some in between.
[14:00.900 --> 14:01.160]  No, no.
[14:01.660 --> 14:02.720]  Cut and sliced.
[14:02.940 --> 14:05.820]  But it's like, think of like a club sandwich with 80 floors.
[14:05.820 --> 14:06.260]  Oh.
[14:07.240 --> 14:15.200]  Like, you just keep layering with, you use each, you use each slice of bread, but you
[14:15.200 --> 14:17.500]  have to use an entire loaf to make one sandwich.
[14:17.600 --> 14:19.820]  I just think three is the limit of my jaw.
[14:20.300 --> 14:23.660]  I believe this is how the director of the raid pitched at the studio.
[14:23.840 --> 14:26.140]  So he had eight, he had an eight layered sandwich.
[14:26.320 --> 14:28.820]  It was like, imagine bad guys on each one of these floors.
[14:29.380 --> 14:33.280]  I just can't help but thinking a vertical loaf of bread with just a bunch of lettuce
[14:33.280 --> 14:35.460]  and tomatoes and sandwich meats sticking out of it.
[14:35.600 --> 14:40.800]  That looks like, you know, a tower would be a striking visual image on a plate.
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.960]  You're talking like Scooby-Doo style sandwich, like a real Scooby-Doo sandwich.
[14:46.340 --> 14:50.740]  I want, if I'm going to make a sandwich out of my bread, I'm cutting that bitch sideways.
[14:51.040 --> 14:56.920]  I want long slices on my loaf of bread, cut my bread sideways lengthwise.
[14:57.060 --> 15:00.560]  So we get long slices that I'm stacking it up that way.
[15:00.640 --> 15:01.860]  Can we do it both ways?
[15:01.940 --> 15:02.780]  Can we try both?
[15:02.780 --> 15:05.840]  Can we get pre-sliced loaf of bread and then an unsliced?
[15:05.860 --> 15:09.480]  I want to see if I make the bread tower that Jeff's talking about.
[15:09.660 --> 15:13.100]  I want to see if we can, that was what I was first envisioning.
[15:14.180 --> 15:20.260]  I think if we did do the tower with all the slices, we would have to employ one of our
[15:20.940 --> 15:24.700]  sandwich flattening techniques to get it down to the size that would fit in a mouth.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.140]  Maybe we could use the guillotine.
[15:26.680 --> 15:27.900]  I like that a lot.
[15:28.540 --> 15:28.900]  All right.
[15:28.900 --> 15:33.060]  So let's, somebody add a note.
[15:33.460 --> 15:34.180]  I'm doing it right now.
[15:34.200 --> 15:35.200]  I'm putting the idea bank right now.
[15:35.260 --> 15:35.440]  All right.
[15:35.460 --> 15:36.120]  Thank you so much.
[15:36.220 --> 15:36.580]  Yeah.
[15:36.880 --> 15:40.620]  While you're putting that in there, let me, let me posit this question to you, Gavin,
[15:41.500 --> 15:48.100]  you get $175,000 for one year tax-free.
[15:48.440 --> 15:48.680]  Okay.
[15:49.160 --> 15:52.900]  Actually, you get whatever it is, like after taxes.
[15:53.020 --> 15:55.000]  So you get like, that's your net, right?
[15:55.020 --> 15:58.660]  I don't know what the gross was, whatever the gross, you get the gross of whatever it takes
[15:58.660 --> 16:00.640]  for you to get the net of $175,000.
[16:00.780 --> 16:01.480]  So it's above board.
[16:01.620 --> 16:02.680]  You've paid taxes on it.
[16:02.720 --> 16:03.620]  That's your cut, right?
[16:03.680 --> 16:03.800]  Okay.
[16:03.800 --> 16:05.300]  So it's somewhere in the 250 range probably.
[16:06.080 --> 16:13.560]  But for one year, when you want to eat a food, you have to eat all of that food, but you
[16:13.560 --> 16:15.080]  can only eat one of that food.
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.180]  So like if you wanted a blueberry, you're allowed to have one blueberry in a 24 hour
[16:19.180 --> 16:19.460]  period.
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.020]  But if you wanted a pizza, you have to eat an entire pizza.
[16:23.260 --> 16:27.600]  If you wanted a watermelon, you have to eat the entire watermelon because that is one
[16:27.600 --> 16:27.940]  unit.
[16:28.080 --> 16:31.620]  But if you want a Dorito, you could only eat one Dorito.
[16:32.280 --> 16:32.500]  Okay.
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.820]  So like if I could hold it, if I could pinch it between two fingers and it just dangles,
[16:36.860 --> 16:37.380]  I can eat that?
[16:38.080 --> 16:38.860]  Yeah, I think so.
[16:38.960 --> 16:42.320]  I mean, you can eat anything as long as you eat exactly one of that thing.
[16:43.780 --> 16:47.360]  So you'd have to be really careful about your cravings because like the first thing I thought
[16:47.360 --> 16:49.620]  of was like, I just I'll fucking eat fruit all day long.
[16:49.940 --> 16:52.420]  One orange, one apple, one watermelon, whoa, whoa.
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.360]  One watermelon would take me some time.
[16:54.820 --> 16:56.860]  One fucking cantaloupe would take me some time.
[16:56.860 --> 17:03.600]  You know, uh, one porterhouse steak, that's going to fuck you up, but you know.
[17:04.120 --> 17:05.540]  So a cereal would suck.
[17:06.220 --> 17:06.480]  Yeah.
[17:06.820 --> 17:07.000]  Yeah.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.340]  I think I think I actually, it's interesting you say that I got stuck on cereal because
[17:11.340 --> 17:11.920]  of my head.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.060]  It was like, would it be one Cheerio or did you have to eat the entire box of Cheerios?
[17:16.400 --> 17:19.740]  I think it would be one Cheerio with a whole milk, with like a whole carton.
[17:20.560 --> 17:23.560]  Yeah, you'd have to use all of the milk in the container.
[17:24.900 --> 17:28.440]  Do you think if it's like one Dorito, then it has to be one Cheerio?
[17:29.020 --> 17:29.960]  Yeah, that makes sense, right?
[17:30.600 --> 17:33.200]  So you just have to be like, you'd be like, all right, I want some bacon.
[17:33.300 --> 17:34.580]  I'll have one slice of bacon.
[17:34.700 --> 17:36.820]  I'll have one sausage link.
[17:37.400 --> 17:42.620]  I think I would be buying a lot of like, I'd be going to a lot of shitty hotels that don't
[17:42.620 --> 17:46.400]  have a proper breakfast, but they have that like dog shit little bar with the little
[17:46.400 --> 17:48.820]  packets of peanut butter that are tiny, you know, that kind of thing.
[17:49.100 --> 17:53.440]  So I'd be taking one bread, folding it over, using a little peanut, but I'd just be getting
[17:53.440 --> 17:54.980]  like tiny versions of everything.
[17:55.100 --> 17:58.760]  You could do that because otherwise, if you wanted a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
[17:58.940 --> 18:04.260]  you would have two pieces of bread and an entire canister of peanut butter and an entire
[18:04.260 --> 18:05.380]  strict canister of jelly.
[18:05.880 --> 18:07.300]  I wonder if they do a little goober.
[18:07.980 --> 18:08.780]  They probably do.
[18:09.160 --> 18:09.340]  Yeah.
[18:09.580 --> 18:12.920]  You'd have to get like, you could only buy food at like truck stops.
[18:15.280 --> 18:16.560]  I would do this.
[18:17.240 --> 18:18.540]  Oh, my pasta would be annoying too.
[18:18.600 --> 18:19.200]  I like pasta.
[18:19.400 --> 18:19.780]  Yeah.
[18:19.880 --> 18:20.180]  Right.
[18:20.720 --> 18:22.140]  You'd have one spaghetti.
[18:22.140 --> 18:22.460]  One spaghetti.
[18:25.300 --> 18:26.920]  You gotta make that food on.
[18:27.360 --> 18:28.880]  You gotta get the most out of it you can.
[18:29.200 --> 18:32.900]  If you wanted to put tomato on your burger, you'd put an entire tomato on your burger.
[18:33.160 --> 18:35.620]  Well, what if we had a draft of one foods?
[18:36.180 --> 18:40.960]  Like a food that you only ever eat one of, like a hot dog is one bun.
[18:41.340 --> 18:42.160]  It's one dog.
[18:43.020 --> 18:45.180]  I guess you're having a little bit of ketchup.
[18:46.040 --> 18:46.660]  Some people are.
[18:47.160 --> 18:47.340]  Hmm.
[18:47.740 --> 18:48.980]  I want to have a draft.
[18:48.980 --> 18:54.220]  See, I want the other way where we would have to draft the food that you wouldn't want to
[18:54.220 --> 18:57.360]  have to eat one of, but it would be for other people.
[18:57.880 --> 19:03.400]  So like, like what you just said about cereal and milk, because it would be one cereal and
[19:03.400 --> 19:04.760]  a whole milk.
[19:05.320 --> 19:08.460]  That is, that would be like a number one on the draft for me.
[19:08.580 --> 19:09.700]  I think that would be fantastic.
[19:10.440 --> 19:11.900]  Drafting the worst one food.
[19:12.640 --> 19:12.740]  Yeah.
[19:12.800 --> 19:13.840]  I think sources are out.
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.600]  If you bought a bag of rice, how long would it take you to finish the bag?
[19:17.680 --> 19:18.660]  Oh, my God.
[19:18.660 --> 19:19.320]  Yeah.
[19:19.460 --> 19:21.380]  How many, how many rices are in a.
[19:22.880 --> 19:23.240]  Yeah.
[19:23.760 --> 19:24.660]  Is it worth?
[19:25.560 --> 19:25.840]  Yeah.
[19:25.920 --> 19:26.840]  I would think so.
[19:26.920 --> 19:27.140]  Absolutely.
[19:27.140 --> 19:27.820]  Uncle Ben's not cool.
[19:27.940 --> 19:28.160]  That might be.
[19:28.300 --> 19:28.440]  All right.
[19:28.640 --> 19:29.840]  That'd be a decade worth.
[19:30.180 --> 19:33.400]  I don't even know how you would cook a rice, a rice.
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.640]  The same way you would cook all the rice.
[19:35.740 --> 19:36.880]  Just put it.
[19:36.940 --> 19:37.640]  It's the same.
[19:37.820 --> 19:39.360]  Two to one rice to water.
[19:39.500 --> 19:42.160]  So you get half of a grain of rice of water.
[19:42.620 --> 19:46.480]  I think you could get a little egg cup, like an induction egg cup.
[19:46.820 --> 19:47.780]  There's no way.
[19:48.200 --> 19:48.560]  What?
[19:49.240 --> 19:51.880]  You you get up and say, oh, my rice cooker is done.
[19:51.940 --> 19:52.860]  I'll be back in a moment.
[19:53.040 --> 19:55.360]  It's just one singular rice.
[19:55.600 --> 19:59.800]  We we should have a one blade of rice cook off.
[19:59.960 --> 20:00.540]  Can you write that down?
[20:00.620 --> 20:01.660]  One grain of rice cook off?
[20:01.880 --> 20:02.020]  Yep.
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.180]  You can cook one grain of rice.
[20:03.340 --> 20:03.840]  I did.
[20:03.920 --> 20:07.440]  Who decided that rice cookers have the ugliest I'm done sound?
[20:08.560 --> 20:10.980]  I can't say I've listened to a variety to.
[20:11.480 --> 20:11.800]  Yeah.
[20:11.960 --> 20:12.300]  All right.
[20:12.420 --> 20:15.500]  There was just like mine doesn't make a sound.
[20:15.560 --> 20:16.500]  It just kicks off.
[20:16.820 --> 20:16.920]  Yeah.
[20:16.920 --> 20:16.980]  Yeah.
[20:16.980 --> 20:17.740]  Mine just made a ding.
[20:18.140 --> 20:19.500]  Oh, I used it last night.
[20:19.920 --> 20:21.780]  I've just been having bad rice cooker luck.
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.180]  What about a draft?
[20:23.280 --> 20:27.120]  That's the opposite of this, where instead of like a one food or one worst food draft,
[20:27.140 --> 20:29.120]  it's the foods that you can eat the most of.
[20:29.240 --> 20:34.340]  So it's like blueberries, Doritos, like things that when you eat peanuts, you just eat like
[20:34.340 --> 20:35.940]  a handful, a ton of.
[20:36.620 --> 20:40.400]  I mean, like couscous, couscous be great.
[20:40.540 --> 20:40.680]  Yeah.
[20:40.820 --> 20:40.980]  Yeah.
[20:40.980 --> 20:43.080]  I love, you know, couscous is a thing I never think of.
[20:43.120 --> 20:43.860]  But I really enjoy.
[20:44.020 --> 20:44.700]  I do, too.
[20:44.840 --> 20:45.200]  Yeah.
[20:45.200 --> 20:45.900]  I really like it.
[20:45.920 --> 20:48.460]  But, you know, lentils is that way for me as well.
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.160]  I really like lentils, but I never think about them.
[20:50.500 --> 20:52.820]  Well, I think that like couscous is small enough.
[20:52.900 --> 20:54.040]  You could eat it through your nose.
[20:55.600 --> 20:55.960]  Yeah.
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.900]  Do you want to do a foods that Gavin can eat through his nose draft?
[21:01.140 --> 21:01.420]  No.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.800]  The pool is too big.
[21:03.440 --> 21:03.640]  Imagine.
[21:05.140 --> 21:06.120]  Oh, I asked for that.
[21:07.480 --> 21:09.220]  You said that you have a big nose.
[21:09.900 --> 21:14.440]  Imagine if your mouth was like cemented shut for a week because of medical reasons or whatever.
[21:14.440 --> 21:19.420]  You would still be able to eat through your nose if it was small enough.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.180]  I had my jaw wired shut for six weeks when I was in when I was 17 after my jaw surgery.
[21:24.360 --> 21:28.300]  And they at no point did they think to put the food through my nose.
[21:28.460 --> 21:28.900]  I wish I had.
[21:28.900 --> 21:34.200]  Imagine if you just done a line of couscous and then, you know, you get it, you suck it
[21:34.200 --> 21:36.560]  back and it's in your mouth and you can just swallow it like normal.
[21:37.240 --> 21:42.400]  Don't you hate when you get texts for somebody to like do dinner plans and you can't because
[21:42.400 --> 21:50.180]  your mouth has been cemented shut for a week because due to medical reasons, it's the worst.
[21:52.260 --> 21:53.500]  Always happens to me.
[21:53.920 --> 21:54.020]  Yeah.
[21:54.960 --> 21:59.680]  Jeff, you're talking about like new draft ideas, but I feel like we have so many that
[21:59.680 --> 22:00.560]  we're already sitting on.
[22:00.760 --> 22:02.660]  I know these all just popped up all at once.
[22:03.320 --> 22:07.460]  OK, should we go through the list of draft ideas that we had and video supplemental ideas
[22:07.460 --> 22:08.940]  that we had on the boat the other day?
[22:09.040 --> 22:09.740]  I guess.
[22:10.200 --> 22:10.280]  And I do.
[22:10.340 --> 22:11.360]  I do want to prefer it.
[22:11.360 --> 22:15.520]  I want to I want to preface some of this, that some of these are ideas that we all said,
[22:15.600 --> 22:22.400]  yeah, and then some of these are ideas that maybe just one person was really excited about.
[22:22.640 --> 22:24.340]  But but but but they're on the list.
[22:24.440 --> 22:28.240]  So should we do a speed run of these because I haven't heard these and I could go thumbs
[22:28.240 --> 22:28.820]  up, thumbs down.
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.120]  Should we do a speed or a Gavin just said the thought that the S.T. word should we do?
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.260]  Is this a sausage shot, Gavin?
[22:34.300 --> 22:34.780]  Is that what you're saying?
[22:35.240 --> 22:35.920]  It sounds like it.
[22:36.300 --> 22:36.820]  Oh, wow.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.340]  You guys want to get into a sausage talk then, like on a day very soon to talk about these
[22:41.340 --> 22:42.020]  drafts.
[22:42.020 --> 22:42.640]  It's been a while.
[22:43.220 --> 22:43.620]  I'm OK.
[22:43.760 --> 22:45.200]  Post would post go up on.
[22:45.360 --> 22:45.800]  Sure.
[22:45.900 --> 22:46.020]  Yeah.
[22:46.080 --> 22:46.300]  Yeah.
[22:46.300 --> 22:47.220]  We are post go up.
[22:47.260 --> 22:48.860]  So maybe we should hold off on these.
[22:48.900 --> 22:49.440]  All right.
[22:49.480 --> 22:52.660]  Audience, enjoy the ideas we just gave you.
[22:52.720 --> 22:53.920]  But hold on.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.660]  The other seven or eight will be coming in a different format.
[22:57.880 --> 23:00.380]  How at some point in the undefined future.
[23:02.260 --> 23:05.180]  When you're starting a business, it's insanely stressful.
[23:05.480 --> 23:07.700]  It feels like you're spinning 16 plates at once.
[23:07.700 --> 23:09.600]  And as you proceed, they only multiply.
[23:09.600 --> 23:12.460]  That's why I'm so thankful for an incredible service like Shopify.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.400]  Shopify, in my opinion, is the best of what it does.
[23:15.660 --> 23:19.380]  And knowing that we have all the support and tools it provides is the best feeling.

[24:11.420 --> 24:11.880]  without it.

[24:43.900 --> 24:48.400]  If you work as a manufacturing facilities engineer, installing a new piece of equipment
[24:48.400 --> 24:50.660]  can be as complex as the machinery itself.
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.020]  From prep work to alignment and testing, it's your team's job to put it all together.
[24:55.500 --> 24:57.860]  That's why it's good to have Grainger on your side.

[25:10.160 --> 25:12.620]  Grainger for the ones who get it done.
[25:14.420 --> 25:16.640]  How many of your...
[25:16.640 --> 25:19.320]  I was talking to Meg and she doesn't have the same thing.
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.440]  How many of your turds are emotional, would you say, in a given month?
[25:23.860 --> 25:24.340]  What?
[25:24.660 --> 25:25.380]  The fuck?
[25:26.700 --> 25:33.740]  Now, do you mean the act or emotional in the sense that there's a squirrel massacre going
[25:33.740 --> 25:39.340]  on above me when using the bathroom, because I feel like you might have a unique perspective.
[25:39.640 --> 25:40.200]  Squirrels are out.
[25:40.740 --> 25:41.580]  Squirrels are out?
[25:41.740 --> 25:42.000]  Good.
[25:42.800 --> 25:45.000]  Well, they're either trapped in or trapped out.
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.140]  Now, do you think it was the snake?
[25:47.240 --> 25:49.840]  Do you think there's just one very fat, happy snake in your ceiling?
[25:50.460 --> 25:51.020]  I don't think so.
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.840]  I think they probably just sealed the hole shut like a mouth for medical reasons.
[25:56.360 --> 25:57.340]  Pumped it full of gas.
[25:57.620 --> 25:57.880]  Yeah.
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.600]  Well, like sometimes I'll just walk into the living room and my eyes are watering and I've
[26:02.600 --> 26:05.640]  got like a runny nose and Meg will be like, oh my God, what's happened?
[26:05.820 --> 26:07.760]  And I've just had a bit of an emotional one.
[26:08.460 --> 26:10.160]  I don't think I've ever had that, what you're describing.
[26:10.160 --> 26:12.180]  Like this shit makes you tear up?
[26:12.800 --> 26:16.260]  Yeah, there's no actual emotion, it's just like my face starts to leak.
[26:16.620 --> 26:17.800]  No, zero.
[26:18.060 --> 26:18.480]  You've never had that?
[26:18.480 --> 26:19.740]  I've never experienced that, no.
[26:20.260 --> 26:20.720]  Really?
[26:21.480 --> 26:21.960]  I mean.
[26:22.240 --> 26:22.600]  No.
[26:23.340 --> 26:28.780]  Shitting is a constant part of my life and an often difficult part of my life and a very
[26:29.820 --> 26:33.980]  frequently painful part of my life and even then I don't think I've ever gotten emotional
[26:33.980 --> 26:34.840]  about a shit.
[26:35.540 --> 26:35.980]  God.
[26:36.440 --> 26:37.140]  What's wrong with me then?
[26:37.340 --> 26:41.840]  I would say like maybe one a month I get a bit sniffly from it.
[26:42.180 --> 26:43.280]  You get sniffly from it?
[26:43.300 --> 26:44.740]  That's odd, I feel like.
[26:45.720 --> 26:49.680]  Do you think you had some sort of attachment to the dinner you ate the night before and
[26:49.680 --> 26:50.680]  you're sad to see it go?
[26:51.500 --> 26:54.680]  Now this guy, he wants to eat flavorless protein cubes.
[26:54.800 --> 26:56.780]  I don't think there's an emotion with the food.
[26:57.720 --> 26:58.500]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[26:59.280 --> 27:01.060]  I didn't say flavorless, did I?
[27:01.560 --> 27:03.940]  I just feel like you would opt for flavorless.
[27:04.240 --> 27:07.600]  I think when you're dealing with protein cubes, flavorless is assumed.
[27:11.140 --> 27:14.860]  It is true, like if it's flavored then why are you not just eating that thing?
[27:15.840 --> 27:19.120]  I feel like the whole point of the cube is that it is zero joy.
[27:19.620 --> 27:21.620]  It is just the nutrients.
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.720]  The cube is that it's nice and quick.
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.640]  I can have lunch as quickly as it takes me to pick up my keys before going out the door.
[27:31.740 --> 27:33.080]  You live your life.
[27:33.340 --> 27:34.880]  You live your fast food life.
[27:36.860 --> 27:38.440]  Whole other level of fast food.
[27:38.920 --> 27:41.940]  When you go out the door, do you take physical keys with you?
[27:42.500 --> 27:43.160]  That's a good question.
[27:44.260 --> 27:48.980]  I just assumed you'd have like a little, you'd open your front door with your phone or wave
[27:48.980 --> 27:50.540]  your hand or something technological.
[27:50.940 --> 27:52.740]  Gavin strikes me as an eyeball scan guy.
[27:53.240 --> 27:53.500]  Yeah.
[27:54.180 --> 27:54.660]  Yeah.
[27:55.100 --> 27:56.940]  Like a retinal scan to open your front door.
[27:58.060 --> 27:58.400]  Absolutely.
[27:58.580 --> 28:00.680]  That'd be pretty cool, but then I feel like people would be off to my eyes.
[28:06.080 --> 28:12.540]  I think, I mean, I get where you're coming from, but I guess I feel like if they're that
[28:12.540 --> 28:13.940]  determined, there's other issues.
[28:14.600 --> 28:14.920]  Yeah.
[28:17.720 --> 28:19.440]  Take my keys, not my eyes.
[28:21.900 --> 28:22.660]  Yeah, fair enough.
[28:23.940 --> 28:25.920]  I have a continent idea I want to run by you guys.
[28:26.360 --> 28:28.080]  I'm very excited about a condiment idea.
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.200]  Content.
[28:29.620 --> 28:31.440]  Oh, content. I thought he's on continents.
[28:31.620 --> 28:32.600]  I thought he was going to be continent.
[28:32.780 --> 28:34.040]  Yeah, we got a continent idea.
[28:34.620 --> 28:35.580]  You got to name them all.
[28:36.480 --> 28:42.500]  My content idea is because we just got the guillotine we showed from Jackass
[28:42.500 --> 28:49.200]  for our big prop, the most recent prop we got that was somehow less expensive to acquire
[28:49.820 --> 28:54.160]  than any of the other props that we've we've bought by like times three.
[28:54.920 --> 28:56.060]  Yeah, that was a bargain.
[28:56.500 --> 29:00.540]  I think, including the other prop we got in that auction, which we haven't talked
[29:00.540 --> 29:03.720]  about because we forgot that we have it just in a box, but we have all of Aaron
[29:03.720 --> 29:08.460]  McGarrity's cups that he wore when he got hit in the dick various different ways.
[29:08.820 --> 29:10.340]  I think we have like three of them.
[29:10.340 --> 29:12.300]  We have the slapshot one for sure.
[29:12.360 --> 29:17.340]  I think we have his hockey jersey from when he was doing the hockey one.
[29:18.160 --> 29:19.860]  But we have the guillotine.
[29:20.700 --> 29:24.240]  I and I want to put my money where my nose is.
[29:24.480 --> 29:25.540]  I was thinking about this.
[29:26.220 --> 29:31.960]  I think we should all create models of our nose
[29:32.760 --> 29:37.540]  and then stress test them by by dropping things using the guillotine on.
[29:37.540 --> 29:41.480]  I mean, I've I've been trying to get you to scan your head for a year, probably.
[29:41.720 --> 29:45.460]  That's a more ambitious thing that is more than nose.
[29:45.920 --> 29:48.840]  Yeah, but it makes sense for the nose to be on the head, surely.
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.300]  So you want everybody's full head?
[29:53.400 --> 29:56.760]  Yeah. And then we got just like a bag of heads.
[29:57.560 --> 29:58.880]  I think that's great. I think that's a funny idea.
[29:58.900 --> 30:01.100]  It's just tougher to get head models.
[30:01.780 --> 30:04.500]  Gav, do you have a line on the head on a bag of heads you can get us?
[30:04.600 --> 30:06.100]  I could just print everyone's head.
[30:06.620 --> 30:09.340]  OK, OK. I love this idea.
[30:10.220 --> 30:11.080]  Does that work for you, Andrew?
[30:11.560 --> 30:12.660]  Yeah, I mean, we could do it.
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.040]  I'll have to figure out measurements for it.
[30:15.720 --> 30:20.000]  But didn't didn't he give you a phone and an app to scan like a hundred times?
[30:20.200 --> 30:21.160]  He did give me an app thing.
[30:21.160 --> 30:25.760]  But with when you have a beard and like the type of my hair,
[30:25.820 --> 30:27.380]  like the beard is mainly the issue.
[30:27.880 --> 30:31.600]  I yeah, but I can I could deal with your beard.
[30:31.700 --> 30:33.820]  I'll just shave it down in my software.
[30:34.300 --> 30:36.700]  You can shave me via your software.
[30:37.540 --> 30:40.640]  Yeah, like had to wear your beard a little bit.
[30:43.730 --> 30:48.650]  See, but then I would feel like you're fucking with my setup.
[30:48.850 --> 30:51.710]  I feel like if my nose gave way, it would be because you manipulated
[30:51.710 --> 30:52.890]  the facial structure.
[30:53.210 --> 30:56.190]  It well, is that does there exist a bald cap for chins?
[30:56.630 --> 30:57.970]  I don't know.
[30:58.550 --> 31:00.210]  Because I feel like uniform could get on that.
[31:00.830 --> 31:02.630]  Definitely a bald cap for chins.
[31:03.310 --> 31:04.710]  Yeah, like a chin cap.
[31:04.710 --> 31:05.510]  I like this.
[31:06.270 --> 31:08.810]  Put it up there with the the tongue tongue gloves.
[31:09.170 --> 31:11.570]  I did something recently
[31:12.290 --> 31:14.990]  where I had to scan my face into a thing,
[31:15.630 --> 31:17.870]  and it was an absolute thing.
[31:17.990 --> 31:19.790]  Gavin's been asking you to do for like a year.
[31:20.150 --> 31:21.810]  Yeah, already for someone else.
[31:22.530 --> 31:24.110]  I did a different face scan.
[31:24.410 --> 31:25.750]  He did. You know what he did?
[31:26.590 --> 31:27.950]  You know. Oh,
[31:28.750 --> 31:33.050]  I did a different face scan, and it was the worst experience
[31:33.050 --> 31:35.690]  I've had in a long time,
[31:36.410 --> 31:40.510]  just because I tried to use the balaclava of my face
[31:41.090 --> 31:45.370]  for the camp, but it doesn't fit my face.
[31:45.470 --> 31:46.550]  It's too small.
[31:47.130 --> 31:48.450]  And so it was gripping my face.
[31:48.550 --> 31:51.150]  So I did it once and I took it off and I was like, finally done.
[31:51.610 --> 31:52.350]  Didn't work.
[31:52.870 --> 31:56.530]  So I thought, shit, OK, I guess I'll just leave it on until it works.
[31:57.090 --> 32:01.110]  I spent 45 minutes with it squishing my face,
[32:01.110 --> 32:04.250]  telling me that you need to do it again.
[32:04.290 --> 32:06.850]  It didn't work without any other instruction.
[32:07.550 --> 32:09.590]  And I eventually had to give up on it.
[32:09.750 --> 32:11.830]  But it was just grueling.
[32:11.870 --> 32:14.590]  I was so mad at the world and my own face.
[32:15.130 --> 32:17.710]  My own face was preventing me from scanning my face.
[32:18.370 --> 32:20.510]  The world will be able to see the results of your actual scan
[32:20.510 --> 32:22.570]  pretty soon on the Gameplay Channel.
[32:22.830 --> 32:24.150]  I love. It's true.
[32:24.710 --> 32:27.070]  I love this idea of using the guillotine
[32:27.810 --> 32:30.310]  in every day for other things, right?
[32:30.310 --> 32:31.970]  Like finding multiple uses for it.
[32:32.050 --> 32:35.450]  Like, I think it should be how we cut sandwiches or bread
[32:35.450 --> 32:38.230]  or anything that needs to be sliced going forward.
[32:38.730 --> 32:42.570]  I was thinking we could even set it up with some tubes of paint
[32:42.570 --> 32:47.710]  where we could put a canvas in front of it and then drop the skateboard
[32:47.710 --> 32:51.590]  at different heights onto like tubes of paint and see if we can make paintings.
[32:51.850 --> 32:53.210]  You know, yeah.
[32:53.570 --> 32:59.490]  My initial idea was to model my nose and then, Gavin, you print it
[32:59.490 --> 33:04.970]  and then we like glue it to the Dilbot and drop the Dilbot from it
[33:04.970 --> 33:06.530]  to just do a nose test that way.
[33:06.970 --> 33:10.470]  So you would just drive the Dilbot onto its nose from a height?
[33:10.830 --> 33:12.170]  I think. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:12.250 --> 33:15.830]  And I think the nose, I might be able to still work around it.
[33:15.870 --> 33:18.190]  I'm not sure where the camera is in relation to the device.
[33:18.570 --> 33:21.970]  I obviously don't want a nose to block the center of the camera,
[33:22.010 --> 33:23.330]  but I think there's a way to make it work.
[33:23.430 --> 33:26.030]  Yeah, I think just below the little black bit would work.
[33:26.550 --> 33:27.730]  Yeah. Below the eye bit.
[33:28.310 --> 33:33.550]  I just really like the idea of of testing the nose with the guillotine.
[33:34.010 --> 33:37.130]  I think it's the perfect device to truly determine
[33:37.770 --> 33:39.710]  who has the most unbreakable nose.
[33:40.710 --> 33:43.950]  Hmm. So should we print it in a material that will break
[33:43.950 --> 33:47.470]  and see who breaks the most or do we want them to be as sturdy as possible?
[33:48.510 --> 33:50.210]  That's another great question.
[33:51.410 --> 33:53.230]  It all has to be the same material.
[33:53.470 --> 33:56.130]  Yeah, I don't think it matters as long as they're all identically strong.
[33:56.670 --> 33:58.090]  Yeah, I think that's the way to go.
[33:58.690 --> 34:00.870]  I think it's a great idea to print the whole head as well,
[34:00.950 --> 34:03.690]  because we could just leave the heads down by the guillotine.
[34:04.150 --> 34:04.870]  It's a great idea.
[34:05.190 --> 34:06.830]  So it just looks like a bunch of people got beheaded.
[34:07.890 --> 34:09.030]  Yeah, I like it.
[34:09.850 --> 34:13.170]  We got to figure out a bald cap for a chin, a chin cap.
[34:13.830 --> 34:15.750]  Or just do it with the beard.
[34:16.570 --> 34:18.190]  I don't. OK, OK, I will.
[34:19.430 --> 34:20.190]  I'll give it a go.
[34:20.870 --> 34:24.490]  Does anyone have a tattoo on the inside of their lip?
[34:25.130 --> 34:25.850]  Tons of people.
[34:26.650 --> 34:27.430]  No, I mean, on this book.
[34:28.430 --> 34:29.870]  No, no, no.
[34:30.590 --> 34:31.230]  Did you want to get one?
[34:31.290 --> 34:32.650]  I'm not an enslaved vampire.
[34:34.890 --> 34:37.030]  You don't want to get a FTW.
[34:37.630 --> 34:39.650]  That was always the big one. Fuck the world.
[34:40.010 --> 34:42.530]  Oh, I'm just I'm like too scared to get a prop one, but I feel like
[34:42.530 --> 34:44.210]  I definitely get one on the inside of my lip.
[34:44.790 --> 34:46.790]  I bet it hurts like a motherfucker to do that.
[34:47.250 --> 34:50.670]  I would get I get high Stanley written upside down.
[34:51.830 --> 34:54.210]  Why? Just the name of my dentist.
[34:56.930 --> 34:59.910]  Oh, so whatever he's rummaging around in there, he'd be like, oh, hello.
[35:00.590 --> 35:02.230]  I don't think he's going to notice.
[35:03.150 --> 35:04.850]  You don't. He would definitely notice.
[35:05.050 --> 35:07.730]  That would be funny if you did that and then your dentist retired
[35:07.730 --> 35:10.890]  and then you had to spend the rest of your life trying to find another dentist named Stanley.
[35:12.170 --> 35:13.830]  Oh, that would suck, especially.
[35:13.930 --> 35:15.890]  Yeah. Like if I couldn't find another Stanley
[35:15.890 --> 35:18.530]  and a different person saw high Stanley, that would suck.
[35:18.870 --> 35:20.970]  I was thinking about this with my wife the other day.
[35:20.990 --> 35:23.070]  I was thinking, God, I'm never going to get divorced again.
[35:23.070 --> 35:25.150]  I'm going to be with Emily for the rest of my life.
[35:25.530 --> 35:27.590]  Guarantee you. Guarantee you.
[35:27.650 --> 35:29.930]  I'll move heaven and earth to stay married to this woman.
[35:30.190 --> 35:35.610]  However, if for whatever reason we did end up divorced or apart,
[35:35.850 --> 35:39.310]  I think I would only date women named Emily going forward
[35:39.310 --> 35:42.670]  so that I would never have to worry about calling somebody the wrong name
[35:42.670 --> 35:45.370]  or screwing up writing a card or you know what I mean?
[35:45.570 --> 35:49.270]  Like just limit the dating pool down to that name and then you're safe.
[35:49.710 --> 35:50.870]  It's awkward, though.
[35:50.870 --> 35:53.830]  I'm sorry I named you my after my dead wife.
[35:54.290 --> 35:55.190]  Sorry about that.
[35:56.210 --> 35:58.270]  I was thinking about the woman I loved who died.
[35:58.590 --> 36:00.610]  You've killed Emily in this scenario and my scenario.
[36:00.690 --> 36:04.670]  She's not dead, but I'm just I think that's the most emotional mistake wise.
[36:05.050 --> 36:07.690]  Yeah, but you're the one that said someone was going to get divorced this year.
[36:07.750 --> 36:09.910]  So you would think that you're just hoping for the divorce.
[36:10.150 --> 36:12.150]  Yeah. Well, I don't have a death.
[36:12.370 --> 36:13.670]  I wasn't hoping for it.
[36:13.690 --> 36:15.870]  It was just a statistical probability.
[36:16.490 --> 36:19.090]  Do you have to get divorced from someone who died or is it just
[36:19.090 --> 36:20.710]  that doesn't count?
[36:20.890 --> 36:23.810]  Actually, if one of our spouses or one of us die this year,
[36:23.850 --> 36:25.430]  that does not count as a divorce for Andrew.
[36:26.250 --> 36:27.930]  Yeah, take that, Andrew.
[36:28.910 --> 36:30.610]  I got to call somebody. One second.
[36:32.450 --> 36:33.450]  You got to call them off.
[36:33.990 --> 36:34.990]  Yeah, I got to call off.
[36:35.570 --> 36:40.530]  Andrew, when did the you know, my my uploading score.
[36:41.030 --> 36:42.730]  When does that end? That's in August, right?
[36:42.770 --> 36:43.330]  It's this month.
[36:43.530 --> 36:44.270]  Well, it was this.
[36:44.430 --> 36:48.030]  Yeah, it was originally August and then you went on vacation for like a month
[36:48.030 --> 36:50.710]  and then we joked about, oh, if you were gone again, like,
[36:50.750 --> 36:52.930]  I guess we should push it back because you were gone for a month
[36:52.930 --> 36:55.950]  and then you were gone for another like three weeks after that.
[36:56.590 --> 36:57.570]  What are you talking about?
[36:57.610 --> 36:59.430]  When was I gone for a month or three weeks?
[37:01.210 --> 37:03.850]  Last month and then the month before that.
[37:04.430 --> 37:06.270]  The seven weeks you were gone, Gavin.
[37:06.430 --> 37:08.810]  But I did like eight recordings.
[37:08.950 --> 37:11.470]  I wasn't. That's like saying you've been gone for five years.
[37:11.510 --> 37:12.170]  What are you talking about?
[37:13.550 --> 37:15.630]  I'm saying we did a lot of recordings
[37:16.290 --> 37:17.970]  at a time to cover your absence,
[37:18.010 --> 37:21.270]  but there were recordings that would have occurred that you were not part of.
[37:21.610 --> 37:22.390]  I was on a plane.
[37:22.570 --> 37:24.590]  I was around for the rest of it.
[37:24.670 --> 37:26.010]  He's got that is true.
[37:26.110 --> 37:30.170]  We both did film recordings on our on our vacations with you guys.
[37:30.350 --> 37:30.970]  Here's the thing.
[37:31.450 --> 37:32.970]  You both recorded things.
[37:33.550 --> 37:35.250]  Jeff, you were in someone else's setup.
[37:35.270 --> 37:37.010]  So it's not like I'm going to randomly ask you.
[37:37.310 --> 37:38.690]  It was very nice that you're able to.
[37:38.770 --> 37:41.250]  But it wasn't like you could drop in or drop out whenever you want to.
[37:41.950 --> 37:44.010]  Gavin, you're on vacation. You're away.
[37:44.010 --> 37:45.770]  So even though you are a vacation.
[37:47.250 --> 37:49.130]  Talk about your back home.
[37:49.170 --> 37:51.370]  You're not you're not you're I don't know what you're doing.
[37:51.870 --> 37:52.810]  You don't say what you're doing.
[37:52.890 --> 37:54.070]  You're just you say I'm out.
[37:54.390 --> 37:56.690]  Out could be I'm with the family in Spain.
[37:56.830 --> 37:58.150]  Out could be I'm doing a job.
[37:58.350 --> 37:59.230]  I don't know.
[37:59.470 --> 38:00.450]  I have no idea.
[38:00.710 --> 38:03.770]  And then when you do when you are at the thing, you just send us a picture
[38:03.770 --> 38:06.490]  of you holding a laptop toward the sky because there's no Internet.
[38:06.670 --> 38:10.710]  I did have to stand in a field to upload the video.
[38:10.950 --> 38:11.410]  That's true.
[38:11.410 --> 38:15.630]  Well, now I don't I don't want to defend Gavin for being out so much
[38:15.630 --> 38:17.670]  because personally, very difficult.
[38:18.110 --> 38:21.530]  But but there is a difference in the calendar.
[38:21.530 --> 38:25.030]  If you look at last month's calendar, which Gavin doesn't have access to
[38:25.030 --> 38:28.490]  for some reason, it is listed to as Gavin out
[38:29.010 --> 38:33.650]  and then listed as Gavin out out, which meant which is insane,
[38:33.830 --> 38:35.950]  which is the same thing he's on.
[38:36.070 --> 38:40.950]  So Gavin out is Gavin is out, but still sort of available.
[38:40.950 --> 38:43.010]  But he changed one of his out out days.
[38:43.630 --> 38:44.670]  And that is true.
[38:44.810 --> 38:46.130]  And then out out changed.
[38:46.390 --> 38:48.850]  Yeah, I was on a plane.
[38:49.470 --> 38:50.390]  Yeah, Nick was out.
[38:50.550 --> 38:53.090]  And then Nick's also out tomorrow.
[38:53.510 --> 38:55.110]  But I don't think Gavin's out out.
[38:55.290 --> 38:57.710]  I think you just need to give us out out days, Gavin.
[38:58.090 --> 38:59.590]  Just don't give us out out days.
[39:00.350 --> 39:02.010]  Why? Or only give us out out day. Sorry.
[39:02.250 --> 39:05.150]  Yeah, I feel like all of Nick's out days are out out days.
[39:05.470 --> 39:07.570]  Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
[39:07.570 --> 39:11.710]  I slept like recording set up at an Xbox across the world.
[39:12.050 --> 39:13.950]  And I say it was only out.
[39:14.330 --> 39:16.510]  But yeah, so I only give you out out days.
[39:16.830 --> 39:19.490]  I think only out out days, because then if I look and I go,
[39:19.570 --> 39:22.110]  Gavin's technically available, I'll ask you to do things.
[39:22.290 --> 39:24.530]  OK, well, I'm going to go ahead and go the other way and say,
[39:24.590 --> 39:28.690]  don't fucking do that, because this is going to be an issue when we go, OK,
[39:28.730 --> 39:31.110]  let's meet at 11 and you go, well, that's not going to work for me
[39:31.630 --> 39:33.330]  because the time is so different here.
[39:33.590 --> 39:36.210]  That's so we I need to know when you're, you know,
[39:36.210 --> 39:39.070]  when we have to make adjustments for calendar, phrase it differently.
[39:39.630 --> 39:41.970]  I think out and out, out totally makes sense.
[39:42.170 --> 39:42.970]  That's how I feel.
[39:43.590 --> 39:45.410]  I mean, I was still on the lay stuff.
[39:45.490 --> 39:49.110]  I did a Tony Hawk stream at like 11 p.m.
[39:49.210 --> 39:50.690]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's great.
[39:50.790 --> 39:53.030]  And so it's good to know that that stuff is happening.
[39:53.190 --> 39:56.590]  So that way we don't have to rely on you for that stuff.
[39:56.590 --> 39:57.570]  And we can work around it.
[39:57.730 --> 40:01.550]  What Andrew I understand what Andrew's saying from a producer standpoint.
[40:01.730 --> 40:02.830]  Please don't do that to me.
[40:02.830 --> 40:06.590]  OK, but if we're going on Andrew rules based on what Andrew just said
[40:06.590 --> 40:09.790]  in the last two months, I was out out for four days.
[40:09.950 --> 40:10.790]  OK, continue.
[40:12.330 --> 40:13.250]  Continue with what?
[40:13.850 --> 40:16.910]  With how with have I made it to the end of the frickin I've
[40:16.910 --> 40:18.610]  I've uploaded everything I needed to.
[40:18.710 --> 40:23.330]  You extended it to September, but I was only four days just.
[40:25.130 --> 40:25.870]  Calm down.
[40:26.350 --> 40:27.330]  OK, you're getting really mad.
[40:27.470 --> 40:31.850]  You're heated when really what I have in my notes
[40:32.710 --> 40:35.010]  is to say, Gavin, thank you.
[40:35.110 --> 40:36.650]  You've done a really good job of uploading.
[40:36.890 --> 40:37.790]  It's in my notes.
[40:38.430 --> 40:39.230]  Oh, thanks.
[40:39.590 --> 40:40.450]  You've done great.
[40:40.870 --> 40:42.150]  He's on your side.
[40:42.610 --> 40:43.130]  On my side.
[40:43.530 --> 40:47.250]  You have made a significant improvement in availability for that stuff
[40:47.250 --> 40:50.070]  or like making sure it's there, not availability, but like that.
[40:50.190 --> 40:51.170]  It's in its folder.
[40:51.830 --> 40:52.710]  You've done great.
[40:52.990 --> 40:54.750]  I literally have it in my notes.
[40:55.250 --> 40:58.830]  Give Gavin credit is shifted and made a change.
[40:59.250 --> 41:01.650]  I'm no longer constantly asking him to upload things.
[41:01.850 --> 41:04.510]  But wait, that's what your note was.
[41:04.610 --> 41:06.590]  And then we went through all of that to get to you.
[41:06.770 --> 41:08.850]  Yeah, because that's the way he wanted it to go.
[41:12.470 --> 41:16.090]  Yeah, Gavin shouldn't be so combative every time someone's trying to compliment him.
[41:16.210 --> 41:20.270]  Well, I mean, I just think it's wild that he said I was on vacation for two months.
[41:20.730 --> 41:21.370]  Well, I don't know.
[41:21.430 --> 41:24.270]  You were you were out of the country for two months.
[41:24.530 --> 41:25.750]  You didn't say he didn't say two months.
[41:25.770 --> 41:26.610]  He said seven weeks.
[41:26.990 --> 41:28.050]  OK, I apologize.
[41:28.050 --> 41:33.560]  So I was thinking maybe for the next
[41:34.340 --> 41:36.120]  yearly counter experiment.
[41:36.480 --> 41:37.460]  Do we know that?
[41:37.740 --> 41:38.980]  Do we know the average on burgers?
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.540]  Uh, because I think we would have wildly different numbers.
[41:44.800 --> 41:47.260]  I think average Andrew is going to be the one to be.
[41:47.800 --> 41:48.540]  We're looking at.
[41:48.600 --> 41:50.440]  That's Google. I don't trust that.
[41:53.220 --> 41:56.560]  Hundred hundred and fifty burgers that don't don't don't
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.760]  don't read the Google and then just say it.
[41:58.760 --> 41:59.580]  That's not what we're doing.
[41:59.660 --> 42:01.600]  We got to find an actual we got to find a source.
[42:01.680 --> 42:04.240]  Well, I'm reading all about burger dot com.
[42:04.280 --> 42:06.820]  You hang on. Hang on.
[42:09.320 --> 42:12.480]  But you're reading all about burger dot com.
[42:12.680 --> 42:14.680]  A burger dot com. All about burger.
[42:15.460 --> 42:17.320]  They're like a national burger society.
[42:17.400 --> 42:20.320]  The average American eats three burgers a week, which adds up
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.640]  to more than 150 burgers a year, according to all about burgers.
[42:23.800 --> 42:25.240]  Dot com. Three a week.
[42:25.280 --> 42:27.280]  There's no there's no way that 150.
[42:27.280 --> 42:28.240]  That's not we have.
[42:28.380 --> 42:29.760]  We got if there's got to be a better story.
[42:29.940 --> 42:31.180]  That's insane, dude.
[42:31.460 --> 42:33.640]  I not to get into a whole hot dog thing of it,
[42:33.700 --> 42:36.300]  but I definitely probably eat three hamburgers a week.
[42:36.300 --> 42:37.360]  Are you serious?
[42:38.140 --> 42:40.160]  It's like this to me.
[42:40.200 --> 42:42.200]  The hamburger is lunch.
[42:42.300 --> 42:44.000]  It's the standard American lunch.
[42:44.240 --> 42:47.300]  If I'm out and I'm hungry, I'm like, oh, just swing by and grab a burger
[42:47.300 --> 42:49.780]  from Peter's or I will say in an hour yesterday.
[42:51.280 --> 42:54.820]  Oh, I think we should do this because I I'm I'm fascinated.
[42:54.820 --> 42:57.100]  I think I maybe do one every two months or something.
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.340]  I don't want to do I don't want to get into sausage talk territory
[43:01.340 --> 43:02.280]  because I know we have that coming up.
[43:02.340 --> 43:05.540]  But one of the ideas on the drafts board is also another yearly
[43:05.540 --> 43:06.460]  food related thing.
[43:06.560 --> 43:09.140]  So we have some other stuff as well. OK.
[43:09.960 --> 43:12.220]  But I like this idea and I'm into this idea.
[43:12.920 --> 43:14.080]  When would you want to start?
[43:14.240 --> 43:15.960]  Do you want to start September 1st?
[43:16.060 --> 43:17.420]  Yeah. Yeah. Like back to school.
[43:18.460 --> 43:19.400]  That's that's lame.
[43:19.480 --> 43:21.200]  Is it Labor Day, September 1st?
[43:21.200 --> 43:22.260]  Yeah, that's Labor Day.
[43:22.260 --> 43:26.760]  All right. So September 1st to September 1st, Labor Day to Labor Day.
[43:27.060 --> 43:28.500]  Let's let's count our heart.
[43:28.720 --> 43:29.640]  And it's not a contest.
[43:29.900 --> 43:30.560]  Not a contest.
[43:30.880 --> 43:33.880]  And there's just you need an important clarification is a double
[43:33.880 --> 43:36.440]  and a single the same or is a double tuber.
[43:37.020 --> 43:37.880]  I think it's the same.
[43:38.080 --> 43:39.800]  It's a single it's a single item.
[43:40.060 --> 43:43.140]  Like if you can order it as like it would say one next to quantity.
[43:43.240 --> 43:43.840]  That's the item.
[43:44.320 --> 43:45.280]  Yeah. OK.
[43:45.740 --> 43:48.340]  Then I feel like we should know doubles or singles as well.
[43:48.500 --> 43:49.360]  This doesn't make sense.
[43:50.220 --> 43:50.720]  I we got it.
[43:50.720 --> 43:53.860]  We got to like really dial in on like this number because some of this
[43:53.860 --> 43:54.880]  is this does not seem right.
[43:55.020 --> 43:56.060]  It doesn't make sense to you.
[43:56.160 --> 43:59.140]  But I'm telling you, after the hot dog thing,
[43:59.160 --> 44:03.700]  I saw so many comments from people who were like, Jeff said that it's insane
[44:03.700 --> 44:07.160]  that anybody could eat 70 hot dogs in a year, but he just doesn't
[44:07.160 --> 44:08.280]  understand the common man.
[44:08.320 --> 44:10.700]  I've eaten four hundred and fifty hot dogs a year.
[44:10.720 --> 44:12.780]  I know. Eight hundred hot dogs last year.
[44:12.900 --> 44:14.500]  Jeff doesn't know what he's talking about.
[44:14.640 --> 44:15.760]  Not the common man.
[44:15.760 --> 44:18.000]  I have a hundred hot dogs a month.
[44:18.180 --> 44:19.340]  And it's like fucking Christ.
[44:19.340 --> 44:20.440]  You might.
[44:20.760 --> 44:23.440]  But I don't think my mother has had a hot dog in 20 years.
[44:23.540 --> 44:25.940]  I don't think my daughter had more than three a year.
[44:26.040 --> 44:28.000]  My wife has had about 10 in the last year.
[44:28.360 --> 44:31.280]  All the guys I work with have fell in somewhere between like a tenth
[44:31.280 --> 44:33.940]  or a quarter of the yearly average.
[44:33.940 --> 44:36.740]  I came in like 90 percent towards the yearly average.
[44:36.820 --> 44:38.300]  And I was trying to hit it.
[44:38.540 --> 44:40.380]  I think there's a lot of people out there in the world
[44:40.380 --> 44:42.220]  who don't eat as many hot dogs as you think.
[44:42.280 --> 44:45.020]  Just like there are obviously a lot of people out there
[44:45.020 --> 44:48.340]  who eat more hot dogs than you think or that I eat.
[44:49.480 --> 44:53.620]  Obviously, the pool is all Americans and it wasn't just the common man.
[44:53.680 --> 44:55.420]  Yeah. Yeah. It's all Americans.
[44:55.820 --> 44:58.980]  I was thinking about if I had ever hit the hot dog quota.
[44:59.080 --> 45:01.140]  And I think I did in the summer of 05.
[45:03.260 --> 45:03.660]  Specific.
[45:04.640 --> 45:06.120]  I'm sure the summer of 05.
[45:06.200 --> 45:07.620]  That's a big hot dog summer for me.
[45:08.320 --> 45:09.420]  How do you remember you?
[45:09.840 --> 45:12.300]  Well, because I don't remember the company,
[45:12.380 --> 45:15.280]  but they had just introduced a product named the Top Dog,
[45:15.280 --> 45:18.000]  which I really liked, where it was a singular
[45:18.640 --> 45:23.240]  like wiener in a little plastic casing and you could throw it in the microwave
[45:23.240 --> 45:26.640]  and then the casing would split and you'd know it was done
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.540]  and then you'd peel the casing and then you'd pop the dog on a bun
[45:30.540 --> 45:31.820]  and eat a hot dog.
[45:32.060 --> 45:36.280]  And I ate so many top dogs the first year that they were around,
[45:36.360 --> 45:40.120]  which I think at least in my market was the summer of 05.
[45:40.440 --> 45:43.340]  I probably was eating like two or three hot dogs every day.
[45:43.840 --> 45:46.960]  I was trying to think, how do you make a hot dog less healthy?
[45:47.140 --> 45:49.960]  And putting it in the microwave in plastic seems to be the way
[45:49.960 --> 45:51.400]  it's a top dog, baby.
[45:51.540 --> 45:53.680]  What do you mean? Less healthy. It's number one.
[45:54.140 --> 45:58.260]  Andrew, something about the way you said hot dog summer really got to me.
[45:58.560 --> 46:00.760]  I really it was a hot dog summer.
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.560]  I really like I want 2005 to be known as hot dog summer.
[46:04.800 --> 46:06.100]  I just looked up a list.
[46:06.180 --> 46:07.580]  I don't know what exactly we can do with this,
[46:07.580 --> 46:11.140]  but I wanted to see what other products were introduced in the summer of 2005.
[46:11.220 --> 46:12.460]  So I put a Wikipedia list.
[46:12.460 --> 46:14.520]  Maybe we should do some sort of a thing
[46:14.520 --> 46:16.700]  themed around the summer of 2005 someday.
[46:16.940 --> 46:20.220]  Do you know that's when the shuffle and the nano came out? Really?
[46:21.240 --> 46:22.540]  And Hurricane Katrina.
[46:23.560 --> 46:25.260]  Apple remote beaver buzz.
[46:25.400 --> 46:26.180]  I don't know what that is.
[46:26.420 --> 46:29.260]  Tag body spray. Now we're talking.
[46:31.620 --> 46:32.580]  Yeah. Furryville.
[46:32.720 --> 46:34.780]  All right. Oh, it's something different.
[46:36.640 --> 46:37.880]  For anyway, it's different.
[46:38.020 --> 46:41.340]  Anyway, I want to investigate hot dog summer of 2005
[46:41.340 --> 46:42.960]  in some way in the future.
[46:43.260 --> 46:45.280]  Content related. Oh, LifeStraw.
[46:45.440 --> 46:47.800]  I this is crazy.
[46:47.940 --> 46:52.660]  According to the USDA, two hundred and twenty two pounds per person
[46:52.660 --> 46:57.380]  of ground beef, which averages out to two point four burgers per day.
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.200]  There's no way these numbers are right.
[46:59.300 --> 47:01.460]  But that's not that's ground beef, dude.
[47:01.600 --> 47:04.180]  Yes, that could be spaghetti sauce.
[47:04.580 --> 47:06.760]  That could be a lot of things. Yeah, absolutely.
[47:07.960 --> 47:11.240]  This is like we have to like drill down and like find the average.
[47:11.240 --> 47:12.600]  It's it might be three.
[47:12.740 --> 47:15.620]  I'm finding a lot of places that say three burgers per week.
[47:15.980 --> 47:18.400]  Yeah, I think that's the average. I think it's the average.
[47:18.620 --> 47:21.240]  I mean, if I think about this way, if the national average
[47:21.240 --> 47:26.060]  is like seventy five hot dogs a year, why wouldn't it be double that for burgers?
[47:26.200 --> 47:29.780]  According to PBS, Americans eat three hot dogs or I'm sorry,
[47:29.860 --> 47:30.760]  three hamburgers a week.
[47:30.820 --> 47:32.500]  One hundred and fifty six hamburgers a year.
[47:32.720 --> 47:34.080]  One hundred and fifty six is the over under.
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.460]  One hundred fifty six in regards to the chicken burgers.
[47:39.080 --> 47:41.300]  Different thing, not countable, only beef.
[47:43.560 --> 47:44.120]  I'm sorry.
[47:44.160 --> 47:45.280]  Chicken burger is part of this.
[47:45.440 --> 47:46.760]  It's like a set like a.
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.860]  If it looks like a burger, I think like here's chicken burger sounds
[47:51.860 --> 47:54.340]  sounds weird to me, but turkey burger, I would allow.
[47:54.440 --> 47:55.600]  So I guess I got all that chicken.
[47:55.680 --> 47:57.180]  Yeah. Or like a lamb burger.
[47:57.260 --> 47:58.060]  I would I would allow.
[47:58.260 --> 48:01.520]  So any food that is called burger is part of the burger.
[48:01.520 --> 48:03.280]  Like we understand what a burger is.
[48:03.340 --> 48:05.040]  And as long as it fits that. OK.
[48:05.720 --> 48:08.040]  I think the burger is the format. Yeah. Got it.
[48:08.040 --> 48:11.460]  If the burger comes, say, like, you know, normally it's served on a bun.
[48:11.540 --> 48:14.240]  But what if it was a specialty burger that served on like a tortilla
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.120]  or like a bed of lettuce or something? No, like.
[48:18.760 --> 48:19.540]  There's some pretty.
[48:19.660 --> 48:23.240]  And yeah, like, are you talking about like those like that place in San Antonio
[48:23.240 --> 48:26.140]  that has like those Frito burger things?
[48:26.600 --> 48:27.840]  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
[48:28.320 --> 48:31.420]  Or like you could get lettuce as a instead of the bun.
[48:31.480 --> 48:33.080]  Like they're I'm fine with all of it.
[48:33.360 --> 48:36.960]  And also like near meat would count impossible burger.
[48:36.960 --> 48:37.780]  Anything like that.
[48:37.900 --> 48:39.320]  We don't need alternatives. Yeah.
[48:39.360 --> 48:40.560]  I had any veggie burger.
[48:40.900 --> 48:43.180]  I just don't see how it could be a burger if it's a tortilla.
[48:43.920 --> 48:44.920]  Oh, it's still a burger.
[48:46.440 --> 48:47.680]  How it's hamburger meat
[48:48.760 --> 48:50.140]  formed into a patty.
[48:50.420 --> 48:51.760]  We just said chicken was fine.
[48:52.640 --> 48:55.540]  Like a chicken in a tortilla is not a burger to me.
[48:55.900 --> 48:57.580]  Um, true.
[48:57.700 --> 49:00.540]  But if it's called if it's a specialty item on a menu and it's called
[49:00.540 --> 49:02.920]  like the something something burger that's served in a tortilla,
[49:03.080 --> 49:06.140]  I think if it's in the burger section of the menu, I think you're fine.
[49:06.140 --> 49:09.560]  Yeah. If it's listed under hamburgers, you're fine. OK. Yeah.
[49:10.300 --> 49:13.200]  I think if you're just doing this at home and calling it a burger,
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.040]  that's one thing.
[49:14.100 --> 49:17.180]  But if you're going to a restaurant and they're doing a specialty thing,
[49:17.180 --> 49:19.920]  I think that's totally in the clear. Excellent.
[49:20.920 --> 49:21.580]  I'm excited.
[49:22.080 --> 49:23.320]  These are going to be interesting totals.
[49:23.840 --> 49:27.180]  September 1st, I think I'm like, oh, man, I feel pretty good about this.
[49:28.340 --> 49:30.900]  I definitely eat more hamburgers than hot dogs.
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.080]  It's not a contest, not a contest, not a contest.
[49:34.660 --> 49:36.640]  Yeah, but it isn't.
[49:36.860 --> 49:37.260]  You're right.
[49:38.060 --> 49:39.780]  It's definitely not a contest.
[49:40.580 --> 49:44.580]  OK, I've made the slack channel, but we can't use it until September 1st.
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.200]  OK. I'm also going to archive dog count because we have we did it.
[49:50.740 --> 49:52.980]  So good work on that one. Good job, everybody.

[50:24.360 --> 50:27.820]  The twisted tale of Amanda Knox is coming to Hulu.
[50:28.160 --> 50:31.560]  In 2007, Amanda Knox was studying abroad in Italy.
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.180]  She had no idea her dream would turn into a nightmare
[50:35.180 --> 50:38.160]  inspired by the actual events of her wrongful conviction
[50:38.160 --> 50:40.460]  and 15 year fight for freedom.
[50:41.080 --> 50:44.720]  Watch the new Hulu original series, The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox
[50:44.720 --> 50:48.780]  on August 20th, streaming on Hulu and Hulu on Disney Plus
[50:48.780 --> 50:51.060]  for bundle subscribers. Terms apply.
[50:52.760 --> 50:56.520]  We should try to schedule Sausage Talk for sometime early next week
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.020]  so we can get these ideas written down before we forget them
[51:00.020 --> 51:01.160]  or lose enthusiasm.
[51:01.740 --> 51:06.320]  I would love it if we could get a website where there's just like a live count.
[51:07.440 --> 51:08.640]  We had to want to check.
[51:09.340 --> 51:11.440]  There was a community made one for hot dogs.
[51:12.060 --> 51:13.040]  Who was updating it?
[51:13.740 --> 51:17.020]  I don't remember the user's name or the person's name,
[51:17.540 --> 51:21.220]  but they they had one and they reached out to us over Patreon
[51:21.220 --> 51:24.700]  to ask if we could forward our totals to them
[51:24.700 --> 51:26.220]  so they can have an accurate number.
[51:26.700 --> 51:29.880]  There were more than 4000 community hot dogs tracked.
[51:30.020 --> 51:32.500]  Using their websites, that's a thing that exists.
[51:33.780 --> 51:36.600]  I would love to talk to somebody out there in the world,
[51:36.820 --> 51:42.060]  maybe in the community, about designing some sort of a website.
[51:44.820 --> 51:48.740]  That displays some sort of a visual timeline of all of our content
[51:48.740 --> 51:51.000]  so that it's a little bit easier to find.
[51:51.060 --> 51:56.100]  I had to go back and find something the other day, and it was a little conflated
[51:56.720 --> 51:58.440]  the process to try to find this old video.
[51:58.440 --> 52:00.460]  And I don't know if there's anybody in the community
[52:00.460 --> 52:02.060]  that wants to lend their talents to that.
[52:02.140 --> 52:04.300]  But I would love to hire somebody or figure something out
[52:04.300 --> 52:08.600]  where we could just have a repository that's easy to see or index
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.160]  or search all the disparate amounts of content that we've created.
[52:12.500 --> 52:15.080]  On Patreon, if it didn't happen in the last like ten days,
[52:15.140 --> 52:17.280]  it's pretty difficult to get to.
[52:17.980 --> 52:20.300]  We do have the collections tab, which makes it a lot easier.
[52:20.440 --> 52:21.660]  It helps. It helps.
[52:21.700 --> 52:23.400]  And that's eventually how I found what I was looking for.
[52:23.500 --> 52:25.380]  But yeah, it's still it's a limit.
[52:25.640 --> 52:28.260]  I'm not complaining about it's a limitation of Patreon.
[52:28.260 --> 52:30.500]  I just I'm not trying to complain about it. It is what it is.
[52:30.540 --> 52:33.180]  I just think it might be cool if we had like a website you could go to.
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.220]  Speaking of like prop auctions and, you know, we got the guillotine recently.
[52:37.760 --> 52:40.620]  I just got an email that I got outbid on an item that I forgot.
[52:40.820 --> 52:42.100]  I bid on two weeks ago.
[52:42.600 --> 52:43.920]  The auction is not live yet.
[52:44.400 --> 52:49.460]  We've talked about before, Jeff, you and I about an estate auction is weird
[52:49.460 --> 52:52.140]  because you have the item and you know that you only have it
[52:52.140 --> 52:53.880]  because that person's dead.
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.280]  And that's just not a great feeling, necessarily.
[52:56.280 --> 52:59.340]  Yeah. It's like everybody wanted me to buy stuff from the David Lynch.
[52:59.460 --> 53:00.420]  Yes. And it was like.
[53:01.720 --> 53:05.080]  I liked him too much to pour through a dead guy's things.
[53:05.260 --> 53:07.260]  Yeah, if that makes sense. It felt weird to me.
[53:07.540 --> 53:08.740]  I completely agree with you on that.
[53:09.220 --> 53:12.320]  There is one coming up where I do not feel that way at all.
[53:12.400 --> 53:15.140]  And it is the estate sale of Larry King.
[53:15.660 --> 53:20.980]  And one of the things that is up for auction is his Shrek two reading script.
[53:22.100 --> 53:23.740]  Wow. That's awesome.
[53:23.740 --> 53:27.760]  It has his lines highlighted and it comes with like
[53:27.760 --> 53:31.180]  a poster, I think, and like something else.
[53:31.780 --> 53:36.340]  I like a framed variety story about with his character on the front of it.
[53:37.960 --> 53:39.480]  I forgot I bid on that.
[53:39.760 --> 53:40.540]  It was very cheap.
[53:41.980 --> 53:45.180]  And I'm glad I got outbid because they don't necessarily want it.
[53:45.260 --> 53:48.140]  It was just the cheapest thing that I thought was stupid
[53:48.620 --> 53:50.160]  that was available to buy.
[53:50.820 --> 53:54.520]  But I guess if people want a Shrek two reading script
[53:54.520 --> 53:56.320]  that was once owned by Larry King.
[53:57.020 --> 53:58.200]  And go get it.
[53:58.600 --> 54:02.160]  So Americans eat 50 billion burgers a year.
[54:02.300 --> 54:03.080]  Not Larry King.
[54:04.760 --> 54:05.560]  They have.
[54:06.180 --> 54:07.660]  I'm just reading this dumb website.
[54:07.900 --> 54:09.800]  They have eight million gallons of mustard.
[54:09.960 --> 54:11.700]  We consume eight million gallons of mustard.
[54:11.840 --> 54:13.360]  I don't even know how you make mustard.
[54:13.540 --> 54:14.580]  I think it's made mustard.
[54:14.740 --> 54:15.420]  It's a seed.
[54:15.580 --> 54:17.720]  And then you crush it up, right?
[54:18.320 --> 54:19.000]  Yeah. Ground it.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.440]  I know that mustard is a seed.
[54:20.540 --> 54:22.860]  I've cooked with it before, but I've never turned that seed
[54:22.860 --> 54:25.640]  into a yellow sauce that I put on top of a hamburger before.
[54:25.860 --> 54:27.340]  I don't know what the process is.
[54:27.700 --> 54:29.660]  I assume water is involved.
[54:29.820 --> 54:33.660]  I assume you put it in one of those grinders and you got to crush it up.
[54:34.100 --> 54:35.580]  I bet there's more to it than that.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.160]  Probably vinegar in there.
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.300]  I bet we probably.
[54:39.500 --> 54:42.220]  Now, vinegar is I have no idea where vinegar comes from.
[54:42.460 --> 54:43.720]  I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
[54:43.860 --> 54:44.100]  Yeah.
[54:44.320 --> 54:47.240]  If somebody told me to make vinegar, how do I do that?
[54:48.320 --> 54:49.940]  I get water and then what?
[54:50.760 --> 54:53.280]  Maybe I'll get into being a like, I've already decided
[54:53.280 --> 54:55.240]  I'm going to be the sack of the sack of burgers guy,
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.740]  which is really going to come in handy over the next year
[54:57.740 --> 54:59.480]  because this is already something Nick and I worked out.
[54:59.760 --> 55:00.220]  Oh, yeah.
[55:00.440 --> 55:03.220]  Or anytime I show up, I just want to show up with a sack of burgers.
[55:03.520 --> 55:04.240]  Do you think I want a burger?
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.780]  Maybe I'll be a mustard maker and get into like like artisan mustard
[55:09.780 --> 55:11.320]  make my DIY mustard.
[55:11.520 --> 55:14.880]  Yeah. Like what if I could develop like a really good mustard recipe
[55:14.880 --> 55:17.140]  and then it's like it because it's awesome.
[55:17.340 --> 55:19.020]  You plant mustard in your backyard.
[55:19.860 --> 55:20.580]  Yeah, probably.
[55:21.220 --> 55:26.480]  Is it just like I'm like, I never thought about like growing a mustard tree.
[55:26.760 --> 55:30.140]  It's like whenever I hear people growing like food stuff like that, it's like,
[55:30.180 --> 55:31.620]  oh yeah, I get some rosemary in the back.
[55:31.700 --> 55:32.240]  I've never heard.
[55:32.320 --> 55:33.760]  I would be like, I got to go get some mustard.
[55:33.880 --> 55:34.460]  I'll be right back.
[55:34.940 --> 55:36.700]  No, it's just like mustard.
[55:36.780 --> 55:39.020]  It's just like a it's just like a little flower.
[55:39.180 --> 55:40.500]  It's like a nice looking little flower.
[55:40.580 --> 55:43.140]  Like if you told me that that's what you were growing, it would be like,
[55:43.160 --> 55:43.740]  oh, that's fine.
[55:44.380 --> 55:46.640]  Could you just have the petals on a dog, do you think?
[55:47.460 --> 55:49.260]  Would you get the same like peppery flavor?
[55:50.060 --> 55:51.460]  I don't think the petals.
[55:51.680 --> 55:54.920]  I don't think it's a Willy Wonka world where the petals taste.
[55:55.220 --> 55:57.180]  I think we got to I think we got to give it a shot.
[55:57.480 --> 55:58.940]  I imagine they taste like petals.
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.880]  Uh, OK, maybe.
[56:02.860 --> 56:03.460]  Let's find out.
[56:03.680 --> 56:05.440]  Why don't this is what you have to do?
[56:05.760 --> 56:07.200]  This this is the experiment.
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.660]  You have to blindfold Gavin and then you have three different hot dogs,
[56:11.660 --> 56:13.000]  each with petals on it.
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.380]  And he needs to be able to tell if he's having the mustard petals.
[56:16.520 --> 56:17.120]  Oh, that's good.
[56:17.180 --> 56:19.120]  One one's like rose ones like roses.
[56:19.400 --> 56:20.160]  This is good.
[56:20.540 --> 56:22.000]  Oh, I'd be able to do that instantly.
[56:22.400 --> 56:25.300]  There's no way that you'd be able to tell which one was the mustard petals.
[56:25.820 --> 56:26.360]  All right.
[56:26.660 --> 56:28.040]  Mustard petal taste test there.
[56:28.180 --> 56:28.840]  Right. All right.
[56:28.900 --> 56:29.420]  Yeah, I'm putting it on.
[56:29.540 --> 56:31.600]  I'm going to put any other edible flowers.
[56:32.380 --> 56:33.800]  Yeah, they're all they all have to be edible.
[56:33.960 --> 56:35.100]  No, we're not going to poison you.
[56:35.680 --> 56:36.900]  It's different edible flowers.
[56:37.480 --> 56:39.400]  So it could be a leaf or something like a mint.
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.960]  No, but it could be mint.
[56:40.960 --> 56:44.280]  It could be a pep.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.080]  What's another basil?
[56:47.160 --> 56:48.220]  Could be parsley.
[56:48.680 --> 56:49.880]  Could be a tulip.
[56:50.180 --> 56:50.880]  Could be dill.
[56:51.240 --> 56:52.020]  Could be tulip.
[56:52.080 --> 56:52.900]  Could be rose.
[56:54.360 --> 56:55.680]  Some nice rose petals.
[56:56.960 --> 56:59.920]  I like the idea of you looking at rose petals on a hot dog
[56:59.920 --> 57:02.960]  and thinking it would taste like ketchup because it could be a hot dog made
[57:03.500 --> 57:06.760]  entirely out of Turkish delight, and the whole thing is set up
[57:06.760 --> 57:09.060]  to get you to eat Turkish delight. Oh, wow.
[57:09.700 --> 57:12.300]  I don't know if I want to be blindfolded anymore.
[57:15.360 --> 57:17.880]  I think you'd be a real cool guy with an inner lip tattoo
[57:17.880 --> 57:20.260]  eating mustard flower on your hot dogs.
[57:20.960 --> 57:23.980]  Oh, you know, it'd be cool if I got to learn how to make this mustard
[57:23.980 --> 57:27.420]  because sometimes mustard goes on deviled eggs, right?
[57:27.460 --> 57:28.400]  Or in deviled eggs.
[57:28.520 --> 57:31.160]  And we're going to do that deviled egg eating competition
[57:31.160 --> 57:33.600]  where Gavin and Nick see who can eat the most deviled eggs
[57:33.600 --> 57:35.420]  that I was going to make all the deviled eggs.
[57:35.680 --> 57:38.000]  Maybe I'll make the mustard that goes in the deviled eggs
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.120]  and then make the deviled eggs.
[57:39.600 --> 57:40.720]  I don't want to get sick, though.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.620]  Oh, yeah. You're not going to get sick.
[57:42.800 --> 57:44.460]  I'm making good food, asshole.
[57:44.860 --> 57:47.820]  It sounds like I'm trying some first first attempt mustard here.
[57:48.200 --> 57:49.900]  No, no, no, no.
[57:49.940 --> 57:51.380]  Make I'm going to write this down. Make mustard.
[57:52.780 --> 57:56.760]  Make mustard to go in deviled egg off.
[57:57.060 --> 58:00.440]  What if we just put in a bag or in the bit barrel?
[58:00.560 --> 58:04.080]  We put in all the condiments and whatever you pull out,
[58:04.100 --> 58:07.300]  you have to make that one from scratch. Oh, oh.
[58:07.300 --> 58:08.900]  And everyone has a different one.
[58:10.680 --> 58:11.980]  Oh, I like that.
[58:12.140 --> 58:15.480]  Can you look it up or do you have to try to ponder how how you even make it?
[58:15.540 --> 58:18.900]  I think you should be able to look it up. Yeah. Good.
[58:19.740 --> 58:21.860]  Because I'm still pondering vinegar here.
[58:21.940 --> 58:22.640]  I've got no idea.
[58:24.260 --> 58:26.020]  I don't I don't know that you can.
[58:26.140 --> 58:28.060]  I don't know that you can like make vinegar in the time
[58:28.060 --> 58:29.720]  we're like trying to make a video. Yeah.
[58:30.080 --> 58:31.480]  I think you just use vinegar.
[58:31.900 --> 58:34.780]  I think vinegar is like a fermented fruit thing or whatever.
[58:34.900 --> 58:35.760]  Oh, fermentation.
[58:36.860 --> 58:39.240]  Yeah, that's probably the way it is.
[58:39.280 --> 58:41.760]  Yeah, because it's the. Yeah. Yeah.
[58:41.840 --> 58:43.000]  What are we fermenting, though?
[58:43.240 --> 58:45.880]  Onion. Is it like onion water?
[58:46.480 --> 58:49.400]  No, no, I think it's like I think I think it's just like grapes and stuff.
[58:49.440 --> 58:51.840]  I think it's just fruit. It's grapes and stuff.
[58:52.160 --> 58:57.080]  I think I think it's like I think vinegar is just it's just a fermentation process
[58:57.640 --> 58:58.480]  from a grape.
[58:58.640 --> 59:02.880]  How many I would never guess grapes to grapes get like they're hogging everything.
[59:03.140 --> 59:04.880]  I think they are. They're hogging everything.
[59:04.880 --> 59:05.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:05.820 --> 59:10.320]  Vinegar is primarily made of acidic acid and water
[59:10.320 --> 59:13.900]  with the acidic acid being produced through fermentation of alcohol.
[59:14.040 --> 59:17.020]  The alcohol, in turn, comes from various sources like fruit, grain
[59:17.020 --> 59:19.480]  or even industrial alcohol, depending on the type of it.
[59:19.520 --> 59:22.560]  Yeah, because I think it's a it's like a wine offshoot, I think.
[59:22.700 --> 59:25.360]  Oh, it's a two step fermentation process.
[59:25.440 --> 59:28.160]  So you can take fruit through alcohol into vinegar.
[59:28.600 --> 59:30.680]  I guess so. Yeah, that's nuts.
[59:30.740 --> 59:31.560]  What happens after that?
[59:31.840 --> 59:32.920]  Because isn't that what they say?
[59:32.920 --> 59:36.180]  Like some like when people like when alcohol goes bad, it turns into vinegar.
[59:38.860 --> 59:42.560]  You said that like you reach the end of the universe
[59:42.560 --> 59:43.700]  and learn that there's more.
[59:45.340 --> 59:46.240]  What's next?
[59:48.420 --> 59:51.060]  What happens if you leave vinegar for 25 years?
[59:51.680 --> 59:55.320]  I bet it gets I bet it tastes really, really, really strong.
[59:55.940 --> 59:58.660]  Yeah. NFL is going to have to move to vinegar salt.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.780]  Oh, you guys ever thought about doing like smelling salts
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.080]  before, like some gaming stuff?
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.480]  I've done considered it.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.180]  They're insane. Yeah.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.020]  We used to have in the army. We used to fuck with people.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.400]  What is it? Smelling salts.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.700]  It's like, uh, yeah, uh, the drugs.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.240]  No, no, no, no.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.800]  It's like a it's like ammonia or something.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.440]  Yeah. Yeah. It's ammonia.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.160]  Yeah. It's ammonia. Like concentrated.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.480]  All right. Cat piss.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.960]  I don't think it's like cat piss.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.280]  I just know it's like a really, really, really, really strong.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.000]  It's like to smell so strong.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.960]  It like wakes you up if you get like knocked out.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:39.220]  And then people do it when it's time to hit like their max
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.160]  like PR stuff when like they're working out or they're about to go hit the field
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.420]  and they got to get all like amped up.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.460]  And I thought about it just going on like Call of Duty
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.860]  and trying to be like that one level.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.160]  Maybe it's what you need.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.940]  Gavin's office is a large smelling salt.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:58.770]  I have been pretty amped in here recently.
[01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:04.050]  They just banned them in the NFL for this season.
[01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.390]  Oh, did they really? I didn't know that.
[01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:10.030]  Yes. Out of concerns that players could use them to
[01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:13.030]  essentially get out of concussion protocol.
[01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:14.750]  Yes. Yeah. And then.
[01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.530]  So that means there's like plenty for us to buy.
[01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.370]  That's true. Yeah.
[01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.570]  Ample number one supplier now out.
[01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.050]  Why would you want to get out of concussion protocol?
[01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:25.610]  If you want to get in there?
[01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.850]  Coach says you got to play, baby.
[01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.950]  Got to play, man.
[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.410]  You want to play more than you want to die?
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.690]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:35.590]  Because every every game you're not playing, your replacement is proving
[01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.050]  that they can do the job that you just couldn't do.
[01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.630]  That's right. You're worried about losing your fucking career.
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.610]  I think it's also just a mindset of like, I'll be fine.
[01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:44.710]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:49.090]  Also, he is something that happens to other people, not me. Yeah.
[01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:52.010]  Have you had a concussion, Andrew?
[01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:56.490]  Oh, or is your head made of the same stuff as your nose?
[01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.330]  I don't think so.
[01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:59.710]  I don't think I've had a concussion.
[01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:05.610]  What was interesting is when my mom was in the hospital for her ankle,
[01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:10.370]  one of the nurses was a the sister of somebody
[01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:13.670]  I went to elementary school with, and she recognized her.
[01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.510]  And they were talking and she brought up me.
[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:20.410]  And her response was, is that the kid that hurt his knee?
[01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:22.070]  Which I thought was interesting
[01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:24.490]  to know that that was my perception of elementary school.
[01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.030]  That was what I was known as, I guess.
[01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.350]  We're playing baseball using a lacrosse stick
[01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:32.890]  like the pole part in the playground.
[01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:34.830]  And I I hit a dinger.
[01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.770]  I hit a home run.
[01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.350]  I got real excited about it.
[01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:39.570]  And I went to sprint to what would have been first base.
[01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:43.810]  And I was right next to the wooden barrier between the gravel
[01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:46.630]  part of the playground and like the cement on the side.
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:50.010]  And I tripped and I fell and I went knee first.
[01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.530]  Into the cement that had a bunch of those little gravel pieces
[01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:54.670]  that like parks have.
[01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:59.850]  And it like shredded my knee in a way that didn't hurt that bad,
[01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:03.950]  but looked really awful and like blood splattered everywhere.
[01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.530]  And all the kids got freaked out and I got sent home.
[01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.850]  Oh, wow. So that's my legacy, I guess.
[01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:11.150]  I'm the kid that hurt his knee.
[01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:15.210]  Yeah, I would say similarly, my like worst injury
[01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.450]  to least pain ratio injury was on my knee.
[01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.370]  That's crazy. Really interesting.
[01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:24.510]  I've had so many concussions that the last one I got, a doctor told me
[01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.710]  that I had to stop getting concussions or I was going to die.
[01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:29.130]  Johnny Knoxville.
[01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:31.230]  Holy shit.
[01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:33.310]  He was like, you know, concussions are really bad for you, right?
[01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:33.910]  And how many of you?
[01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:35.550]  And I was like, it was my fifth concussion.
[01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:37.010]  And he was like, you've got to stop doing this.
[01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:37.850]  You're not going to live long.
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.210]  And I was like, oh, I'm not trying to.
[01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:40.950]  How did you get the fifth one?
[01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:42.330]  I was in the army.
[01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:45.390]  And you already have five like in your 20s.
[01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.090]  Yeah, I was in my 20s.
[01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.350]  I'm like 22, maybe.
[01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:49.790]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:53.410]  I got hit by a baseball that knocked me out flat.
[01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.610]  Woke up in the emergency room, had a little bit of gray hair from that one.
[01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:02.330]  Fell off a half pipe on my head, went over the handlebars on a bike once.
[01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.150]  I think there's another one in there somewhere.
[01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.690]  And then anyway, the one that I the last time I got a concussion is
[01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:09.290]  maybe the worst.
[01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:10.970]  I was pushing an A.V.
[01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:14.050]  cart in the army, and it was like so fucking heavy.
[01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:20.190]  And I, I like was like working it around a corner and I got kind of stuck.
[01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.730]  So I went around the other side to pull and I like wrenched it free and pulled.
[01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.010]  And so it's one of those things where you're like pulling a heavy cart
[01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:28.990]  towards you and it it pushes into you.
[01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.470]  And as it was like pushing into me with momentum, I turned around
[01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:36.190]  and there was a stairwell and it was like the landing on the stairs
[01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.970]  like right above me.
[01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:39.670]  So it was like right like the line of where
[01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.570]  I guess began was right about my forehead height.
[01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:44.450]  It was just like under like about a duck.
[01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:45.310]  I would have gone under it.
[01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.350]  And the cart pushed me, pushed my forehead into the stairs.
[01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.410]  And I was fucking going up.
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:51.990]  Oh, just gone.
[01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:52.610]  That was rough.
[01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:54.110]  Brutal. Fuck.
[01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:55.450]  Wow.
[01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.590]  Yeah.
[01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.410]  So you've done really well in the last couple of decades.
[01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:03.710]  I haven't had a concussion in over 20 years.
[01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:06.030]  You better start knocking on wood, bud.
[01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.410]  That's wild. Wow.
[01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.110]  I don't I don't want to get any more.
[01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.730]  That's for sure.
[01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:11.930]  No kidding.
[01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:15.750]  Well, we got to be very gentle with you from like 10 to 22.
[01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:17.470]  I was real rough on me.
[01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:20.530]  I've yeah, so like that was like a 12.
[01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.130]  That was my 12 year concussion period.
[01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.510]  But I'm past that.
[01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:27.110]  I'm like, I'm floored.
[01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:29.070]  If you would have been like, oh, yeah, we were doing like immersion,
[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.850]  it would have been like, oh, yeah, I wonder which one that was.
[01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:32.350]  And you were like, so I was 22.
[01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:36.150]  Like, no, the only time I ever got hurt
[01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:39.830]  in my 22 year career at Rooster Teeth was on Does It Do?
[01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.290]  Oh, yes. Oh, that's right.
[01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.610]  Oh, yeah. Poor Tyler's staff.
[01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.630]  I know. I felt so bad for him. Poor Tyler's staff.
[01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:48.950]  I was trying so hard.
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:51.150]  I put my hand behind my back and I was like, let's wrap up.
[01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.750]  Let's keep filming.
[01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:53.390]  And they're like, why are you what's going on?
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.790]  And I was like, it's fine.
[01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:56.210]  Well, I was like, it's fine. We just keep filming.
[01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:57.170]  I was like trying to wrap it up.
[01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.950]  And I'm like, it's going to be fine.
[01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.570]  We're going to get through it.
[01:05:58.590 --> 01:05:59.830]  And they were like, absolutely not.
[01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:02.610]  And then you huffed some smelling salts and you kept going.
[01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:08.750]  I've been having fun being at the office a lot recently.
[01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:09.910]  We've been doing a lot in there.
[01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.350]  Yeah. Got the pinball machine moved.
[01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.750]  It's been great, man.
[01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:14.750]  This place rocks.
[01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:16.070]  Not by the front door anymore?
[01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.710]  No. I have found
[01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:23.130]  I found an excuse to go every day this week, and it has been just a delight.
[01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:27.310]  I'm going to have to probably come less because you've started
[01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:28.970]  going back to Achievement Hunter mode.
[01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.130]  We had a close call today.
[01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:33.850]  We had Andrew.
[01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.950]  We had a close call.
[01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:39.350]  We had an Achievement Hunter close call today.
[01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:41.310]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:42.970]  I start with all the sprinklers off.
[01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:45.490]  No, no, we don't have sprinklers.
[01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.010]  No, I had a look.
[01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.050]  I had a coffee on my desk.
[01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.550]  Well, iced coffee that Eric kindly got me from nearby.
[01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:56.550]  And what's
[01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.310]  Gavin and I sit next to each other.
[01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.710]  I sit to his left and I saw that coffee and I shit you not, Andrew.
[01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.470]  I saw that coffee on his desk
[01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:08.370]  and it was in front of his keyboard and the way he was sitting.
[01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:14.010]  And my hand reflexively bat like I got into a backhand motion
[01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:18.050]  and I was reflexively about to like I wasn't even thinking
[01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:21.670]  I was just in autopilot mode and I was about to whack it
[01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.210]  and see if I could hit the coffee into his keyboard
[01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.710]  and then all the way down into his lap.
[01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.330]  And I was like, what do you do?
[01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.870]  I saw my hand. I was like, what are you doing?
[01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.730]  I stopped myself and I was like, no, don't.
[01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:33.050]  And then I told him what I'd almost done.
[01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:34.730]  But it was real close, man.
[01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:37.610]  I if I wasn't paying enough, I wasn't paying attention.
[01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:41.210]  I was maybe you're not a menace and it's just you have catlike reflexes.
[01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.110]  No, I think I'm a cat move.
[01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:44.630]  Just swiping a thing on the thing.
[01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:46.030]  I think I'm a menace.
[01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:49.330]  It's like there was a movie a couple of years.
[01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:51.490]  I remember a horror movie where a guy got like a hand.
[01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:56.070]  Oh, he got decapitated and he got his decapitated.
[01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.590]  He got his arm cut off and he got like a new arm.
[01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:00.950]  But the arm was evil from a serial killer and it would do stuff
[01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:02.930]  and hurt people and he had no control over it.
[01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:05.710]  I have like I have like a dickhead hand.
[01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:11.090]  I just have like a hand that is a menace.
[01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:13.070]  It's that I don't have any control over.
[01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.470]  It belongs to you and you are 20, but you've still got it.
[01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:21.070]  Yeah, I've got I've got two 20 year old hands in a 50 year old's body.
[01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.510]  And I just I don't know what to do about it.
[01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.610]  I forgot what it's like to be in the office,
[01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:31.170]  just like in in your vicinity, but not necessarily working on something
[01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:34.510]  like I was under the the other day I was under the desk trying to like
[01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.490]  we rewire some of the networking stuff just so we all have our own
[01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.310]  like full gigabit connection and I'm unplugging stuff.
[01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:43.490]  And then it's like moving ethernet cables around.
[01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:46.670]  And then suddenly from above, because I'm under the desk,
[01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:48.950]  all I hear is like slam, slam, slam.
[01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:50.030]  It's like nothing works.
[01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:54.130]  But and I guess I unplugged your Xbox, Jeff, or something.
[01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.810]  And then you getting annoyed at that and slamming the table,
[01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.030]  then somehow like unplugged your HDMI
[01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:05.330]  and you were just getting more and more annoyed,
[01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:08.850]  just smacking everything and breaking everything as it was.
[01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.690]  It was like a cascading effect.
[01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:11.970]  Yeah, I went beyond my control.
[01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:14.930]  It was a full day of Jeff having tech problems and they did.
[01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.350]  The shit just kept rolling downhill.
[01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:19.690]  And that meant some keyboards were getting slammed around on the desk.
[01:09:19.690 --> 01:09:22.990]  You smashed your space bar off, which is great.
[01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.630]  I think we've had that keyboard for a month.
[01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:28.810]  And all you need to do is just wait for it to come back on.
[01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.950]  I had to rewire like half your shit because you'd lose the deal.
[01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:35.750]  I put the keyboards, the space bar back on.
[01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:36.730]  It's back on. It works.
[01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:38.910]  Yeah, I got real mad for a second.
[01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:40.950]  This is under the table.
[01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.390]  Just like, all right, chill out.
[01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:44.370]  Shit stopped working in the middle of something.
[01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:45.870]  Suddenly stuff's not working.
[01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:48.110]  And then I dropped my controller on the ground wide
[01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:49.790]  through my controller on the ground or whatever.
[01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:52.890]  And it made my monitor stop working.
[01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:57.090]  I mean, no, it was like a Rube Goldberg of shit.
[01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:58.410]  Oh, man.
[01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:01.110]  Gavin, did you see that Rube Goldberg I sent you the other day?
[01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:03.530]  The video? Yeah, that was great.
[01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:06.290]  Oh, man.
[01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.690]  You make it sound like I'm some sort of an angry tyrant,
[01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:13.210]  but it was all done in a playing loving way.
[01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.210]  Oh, yeah, it was like tongue in cheek.
[01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:18.870]  But then you then you actually broke stuff for real that I had to fix.
[01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:20.030]  And you were genuinely annoyed.
[01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:22.010]  Well, yeah, because I broke stuff.
[01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.070]  But I was mad at myself, not you.
[01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:28.490]  Yeah, I guess I've never worked in the same office as you where I'm
[01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.450]  I.T. and tech support.
[01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.230]  So it's a different, slightly different experience.
[01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:38.370]  It's fun, though.
[01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:39.730]  It's so much fun.
[01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:41.350]  I really am having a blast.
[01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.070]  We need some new drinks, though.
[01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.770]  We're low on drinks.
[01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:47.450]  Have we talked about the awesome trash can that we got at work?
[01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:48.710]  I don't think so.
[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.250]  No, I really I don't.
[01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:51.290]  I don't think so.
[01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:55.610]  I don't. We got to release that video of Eric with the trash can on social.
[01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:57.290]  You do it today.
[01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.730]  Instant classic. Instant classic.
[01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:04.690]  We we when we went to El Famoso for the hot dog Thursday that they had,
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:10.150]  we were taken aback, Eric and I, because in their break room,
[01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:14.450]  they had one of those trash cans with the swinging thank you
[01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:18.270]  door that you put the trash in that they have at fast food restaurants
[01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.890]  like they have at Wendy's or McDonald's.
[01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.950]  And we were like, how the fuck did you guys get that?
[01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:26.650]  And Natalie was like, we we have a hookup or whatever.
[01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.350]  And we're like, could we get your hookup?
[01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:29.090]  And then it fell through.
[01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:33.570]  But we just bought one on a Granger or one of those like industrial websites.
[01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.410]  And we finally put it together.
[01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.910]  And it is the coolest fucking thing in the world.
[01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.650]  It looks like a lot of fun.
[01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.670]  Our kitchen looks like a Burger King now.
[01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:45.250]  And if we wanted to put up that video on social tomorrow,
[01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:46.790]  is that all right, Eric, or have we missed it?
[01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:50.430]  Oh, you can just tell me when you want it up.
[01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:54.690]  I can put together a thumbnail, big head.
[01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:56.030]  Oh, yeah. Yep.
[01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:58.650]  That's just you can just tell me when you want it up.
[01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:00.490]  And then when it's about to go up, you can change your mind.
[01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.090]  That's up to you.
[01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.770]  I didn't change my mind. What do you mean? OK.
[01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:06.670]  Well, what what did I change?
[01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.250]  No, it's fine. Yeah.
[01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.530]  You just let me know when you want it up.
[01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:09.670]  Jeff and the episode.
[01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:12.730]  Yeah, I whenever you want it up, you just say,
[01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:17.570]  but I can't let this before before I can check the calendar.
[01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.150]  It should be there.
[01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:20.610]  But we're ahead of the stage.
[01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:26.390]  How do you just have a look at that calendar?
[01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:28.450]  Do you have your most updated screen?
[01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:30.450]  Yeah. Yeah. Just check out that calendar.
[01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:31.870]  You just let me know what day you want it up.
[01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:32.770]  We'll put it up. No problem.
[01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:34.970]  I'm telling you whatever day you want, man.
[01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:38.430]  OK, I tried to keep going.
[01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:39.530]  Just keep fighting through it.
[01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:41.830]  All right. Well, before we before regulation,
[01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:44.610]  the regulation company disintegrates in front of us all.
[01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.670]  This has been episode 66 of the regulation podcast.
[01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.490]  We hope you liked it.
[01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:51.570]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:53.090]  This one was in rehearsals for week.
[01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:54.250]  We did dress rehearsals.
[01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:58.070]  We did we did like four different read throughs of the script.
[01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:00.310]  But I really feel like we nailed it this week.
[01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:02.630]  Hopefully you agreed with us.
[01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:05.430]  And we got to we got to get to writing because we got a whole new script
[01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:08.010]  to come up with for 60 still in season one, a regulation error.
[01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:10.470]  Oh, no, I think we're in season two.
[01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:11.690]  OK, the season.
[01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:13.670]  I felt like it was still pretty season one ish.
[01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:15.650]  I mean, should we do we vote?
[01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.450]  Did we not declare at the end to see?
[01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:18.170]  I thought we did.
[01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:20.210]  I thought we got to be on the one year mark. Yeah, you're right.
[01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:21.730]  I think we did it the one year. OK, so.
[01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:24.090]  Yeah, but Gavin's got some decisions to make about it.
[01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.830]  So don't don't worry. He'll let us know later.
[01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:29.450]  Gavin, go ahead and get those notes to us on that decision.
[01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:31.550]  We made four months ago now that it's now that it's done.
[01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:32.690]  Yeah, absolutely. Now's the time.
[01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:36.690]  Appreciate it. And oh, yeah.
