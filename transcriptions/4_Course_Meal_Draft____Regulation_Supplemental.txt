[00:00.000 --> 00:04.440]  I'm a kid, so am I going to surprise you with a poster board I need for the science fair tomorrow?
[00:04.720 --> 00:08.940]  Probably. But can you get up to 40% off back-to-school essentials on Uber Eats?
[00:09.180 --> 00:13.080]  Definitely. So order on Uber Eats and get up to 40% off.
[00:13.300 --> 00:14.800]  Exclusions may apply. Check app for availability.

[00:34.100 --> 00:40.240]  Hello and welcome to another piece of regulation content. This one's a supplemental. It is a
[00:40.240 --> 00:47.800]  draft. It is a food-based draft. Today we are doing the four-course meal draft. I believe Gavin gave
[00:47.800 --> 00:52.260]  us this idea in Vegas and we all jumped at the chance to do it, so we're very excited.
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.800]  Gavin, what were you thinking when you came up with this idea? What was the genesis behind this idea?
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.660]  Well, considering I didn't really understand this idea, which was not my idea,
[01:03.940 --> 01:08.760]  I don't think I'm in any position to explain it. Magnanimous and humble at all times.
[01:09.280 --> 01:11.380]  Thank you so much for a career, Gavin. I thank you.
[01:11.460 --> 01:14.320]  Yeah, I really appreciate it. Yet again, cannot thank you enough.
[01:14.820 --> 01:19.840]  What do you guys think we should randomize this one for? Four? It's a four-course meal?
[01:20.120 --> 01:22.480]  Four times? Yeah, either four or...
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.020]  Yeah, I want to hear from Andrew because I knew it wasn't going to be as simple as that. Go ahead.
[01:25.020 --> 01:28.620]  It's either four or 16. Either or. And why 16?
[01:28.640 --> 01:30.600]  Why would it be 16? Because... 20.
[01:32.160 --> 01:34.000]  What? And why would that be?
[01:34.580 --> 01:36.820]  Four for each of us. I was thinking four by four.
[01:37.020 --> 01:41.960]  Okay. Yeah, no, I definitely could follow exactly where your head went. I went,
[01:42.100 --> 01:45.760]  that's not right. That's not right at all. No, I went, there's four of you and there's
[01:45.760 --> 01:49.960]  a four-course meal. 16. And then I went, I'm part of this as well. Never mind. 20.
[01:51.080 --> 01:52.880]  Unfortunately, you are part of this.
[01:53.420 --> 01:54.500]  Every draft is 20.
[01:58.120 --> 01:59.120]  Thoughts? I have none.
[02:08.490 --> 02:10.610]  I'm looking at my menu. I have time for this.
[02:10.990 --> 02:14.490]  Oh my god. Okay, so what are we doing? We draft four? Is it four?
[02:14.590 --> 02:15.870]  Let's do four. Yeah, we're doing four.
[02:16.150 --> 02:19.690]  All right. Well, as always, we're using Sean Bear's site. Thank you very much,
[02:19.770 --> 02:23.050]  Sean Bear. This makes it so easy for us and we can randomize as many times as we want.
[02:23.050 --> 02:31.170]  Starts in an egg order and now we will randomize four times. One, two, three, Gavin, Andrew, Eric,
[02:31.410 --> 02:39.770]  Jeff, Nick, but the fourth and final randomization. Boom! Jeff, Gavin, Eric, Nick, and I remember.
[02:40.610 --> 02:42.990]  Jeff back-to-back ones.
[02:44.450 --> 02:51.630]  Boys, you have no idea how exciting this is. As me and Jeff were here today, I said,
[02:51.630 --> 02:55.310]  Jeff, how are you feeling about these drafts? And he said, you know what, Emily didn't love my
[02:55.310 --> 02:58.730]  one-hit wonders picks, but that's okay. I really feel good about them. And I said, that's great.
[02:58.770 --> 03:01.950]  How about the four-course meal draft? How are you feeling about that? He said, well,
[03:02.850 --> 03:08.590]  I'm not sure. I guess I'll do it based on what you guys draft. And then I said, Jeff,
[03:08.710 --> 03:15.150]  what if you go first? And Jeff said, don't worry, I never go first. And now we begin the
[03:15.150 --> 03:21.750]  four-course meal draft with Jeff Ramsey. Okay, for my first pick, obviously in a
[03:21.750 --> 03:27.650]  four-course meal, you want to start with the appetizer, which is where I'm going to take us.
[03:29.030 --> 03:33.070]  When I sit down to eat a four-course meal, the first thing I want to have is a little bit of
[03:33.070 --> 03:39.190]  bread, but maybe some Tang too. So I'm going to go with the item that I have been planning on
[03:39.190 --> 03:46.930]  for weeks in this draft, because clearly I came in prepared, bruschetta. A little bit of bruschetta,
[03:47.030 --> 03:51.590]  a little tomato, a little drizzle. Did you say Tang? What is it about the bruschetta that you're
[03:51.590 --> 03:58.710]  feeling particular about? Oh, I love the cheese mixed with the warm crust of the bread with the
[03:58.710 --> 04:03.990]  little cut up, diced up tomatoes on top. Sometimes there's some parsley as well, which is delicious.
[04:03.990 --> 04:10.630]  And then a little olive oil and vinegar spread over the top. It's tangy, it's delicious, it's
[04:10.630 --> 04:15.870]  crunchy, it warms your little tummy. And you've been planning on that for weeks now? Oh my god,
[04:15.970 --> 04:19.510]  since Gavin gave us the idea, I think I immediately went down and started riding.
[04:23.990 --> 04:30.630]  Fuck. Also, not cool to be on the end when you don't have anything planned. Yeah, this is pretty
[04:30.630 --> 04:37.570]  good. Gavin, you have the second pick. As Geoff has set the tempo, you now can do anything you
[04:37.570 --> 04:43.790]  want based on what Geoff has done. Well, bread is amazing. I just didn't consider that it might be
[04:43.790 --> 04:48.410]  a course, because I feel like you can keep bread going through multiple courses, more of a side
[04:48.410 --> 04:57.790]  thing for me. So I want to sit down and stuff my fat face with a lovely prawn cocktail. And I want
[04:57.790 --> 05:04.690]  it to be in that format, hanging over the thing, a bit of that red spicy-ish sauce. And I don't want
[05:04.690 --> 05:11.790]  the tiny little shrimpy ones, I want just fat old prawns. Yeah, big ones. Nick said cocktail sauce,
[05:11.850 --> 05:15.630]  and then you didn't say anything? Oh, sorry. Yeah, you were both talking at the same time.
[05:16.170 --> 05:23.590]  Oh. Nope. I don't think so. I'm with Gavin, that's how it came across for us. Oh no. Dude,
[05:23.590 --> 05:28.210]  this internet maybe sucks. No, I think you just should shut up a little bit, and then I'll hit
[05:28.210 --> 05:34.810]  Nick. Nobody was talking, and then Nick talked. You were talking! Definitely wasn't. Cocktail sauce.
[05:35.090 --> 05:40.790]  You know what? Hey, cocktail sauce. Yes, cocktail sauce. It was my condiment. It was. Excellent. I
[05:40.790 --> 05:45.550]  was just thinking about that. Yeah. It'd be disgusting to spill your prawn cocktail over
[05:45.550 --> 05:52.610]  the bruschetta. Just ruin it for everybody. Nobody wants that. I'm liking these pics so far.
[05:53.590 --> 05:59.950]  All right. Well, we go to mine next, and I had a lot of choices. I think appetizer is really
[05:59.950 --> 06:07.290]  important in everything, but it's all about what you want in your own four-course meal, and for me,
[06:07.830 --> 06:16.090]  that's Coors Banquet. Crack a couple of yellow cans, fill up a little bit before you really get
[06:16.090 --> 06:25.630]  started. Beautiful. From the streams of Golden, Colorado, comes Coors Banquet. The beer that my
[06:25.630 --> 06:32.390]  neighbor Larry, growing up, would drink tons of and just throw in his backyard. Just Gavin-style.
[06:32.730 --> 06:38.110]  Finish it. Boom. Throw it in the backyard. That's where it goes. See the cans pile up,
[06:38.490 --> 06:45.190]  but that is my appetizer. You come over, check it out. Boom. Coors Banquet. I'm really liking
[06:45.190 --> 06:50.350]  these. I'm visualizing walking into a restaurant, and this being what I'm greeted with so far.
[06:50.550 --> 06:56.590]  Hell yeah. It's a good meal for me. Nick, Coors Banquet's my pick. Sorry if that stepped on yours,
[06:56.710 --> 07:00.930]  but go ahead. Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pivot. No, this is actually... I came into this
[07:00.930 --> 07:06.810]  with just one thing in mind, so if this got taken, I was totally screwed. Nick told me he has no
[07:06.810 --> 07:14.350]  backups. If someone picks, by accident, something that he picked, he's fucked. He's fucked. Royally
[07:14.350 --> 07:19.150]  and utterly fucked. But we've talked about it, right? It's the opening course. It's the appetizer,
[07:19.230 --> 07:23.350]  the hors d'oeuvre, if you will. There's not quite an hors d'oeuvre like this one, and I'm going with
[07:23.350 --> 07:30.750]  a Bloomin' Onion. Oh! Bloomin' Onion. The Bloomin' Onion! That's a good one. That's a really good
[07:30.750 --> 07:36.070]  one. That's a really good one. This is calorically an insane meal. I don't think I'd want to eat
[07:36.070 --> 07:40.470]  anything else after that. No, that would be it. Share it, Gavin. You share it. You don't eat the
[07:40.470 --> 07:45.390]  whole thing yourself. It's for the table. Why did Emily and Meg and I go get a Bloomin' Onion
[07:45.390 --> 07:50.090]  together without you recently? What was the deal there? What? Where were we? Oh, maybe because I
[07:50.090 --> 07:55.550]  don't want to eat that. I don't know. I thought I would have gone just to hang out. Oh, is that why?
[07:55.790 --> 07:59.410]  I mean, it's fine. It's like you have one or two little nibs, and it's like, okay, I'm done with
[07:59.410 --> 08:05.850]  that. Could I speculate that maybe it was during a labubu hunt? It was not. It was before the labubus.
[08:06.310 --> 08:10.090]  But if it was during a labubu hunt, Gavin would have been there because he was at the last labubu
[08:10.090 --> 08:16.610]  hunt hanging out with all of us. I sat on a little camping chair. Pretty impressive. Bloomin'
[08:16.730 --> 08:22.510]  Onion. Good pick right there. Thank you. But now we go over to Andrew. I'm excited. Who will have
[08:22.510 --> 08:28.310]  his first course, but he'll also have his second course. Andrew, what are you going with? First and
[08:28.310 --> 08:33.290]  second, serving it up for the people. This is going to look like this is my one and two going
[08:33.290 --> 08:37.670]  into this, but this is going to feel like I'm really taking some Nick energy here. I'm going
[08:37.670 --> 08:44.670]  to open once again with another thing in the bread family. It's my favorite bread type thing
[08:44.670 --> 08:52.150]  to receive when going to a place. I want a nice focaccia with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
[08:52.390 --> 08:58.310]  You can dip it. You mix it around. It's the saltiness. It's delicious. So that is what I'm
[08:58.310 --> 09:04.870]  opening with for my first dish. And that that's another bread course. That's another bread course.
[09:04.870 --> 09:08.390]  Gavin, how do you feel about that? I mean, once again, delicious. I just don't think
[09:08.390 --> 09:14.670]  I would order that for it. So I'm sort of envisioning my thing being from the moment
[09:14.670 --> 09:20.310]  you sit down till you leave. So you're immediately you're hit with the bread. Also, I've never seen
[09:21.270 --> 09:25.870]  a bruschetta, my thing, as a side. It's always an appetizer at Italian restaurants. That's true.
[09:26.310 --> 09:31.850]  Yeah, that's never like just on the table as you sit down. But that could still be an hors d'oeuvre.
[09:31.850 --> 09:37.230]  Could. But now we're moving to my appetizer. I mean, I'm building I'm building a little bit of
[09:37.230 --> 09:42.990]  the theme. And for my appy, this is you've looked at the menu. Now you're evaluating.
[09:43.650 --> 09:52.250]  I love open it up. Everyone can share plate of bacon barbecue wrapped prawns. Delicious.
[09:52.770 --> 09:57.590]  So good. Double prawns. That crunch. You get the prawn, a delicious prawn,
[09:57.590 --> 10:03.430]  some barbecue sauce on there, you get the tang. It's delicious. Now, do they say prawn in Canada
[10:03.430 --> 10:09.590]  or do they say shrimp? Uh, you hear both. OK, I don't think there's a wrong answer, but prawn
[10:09.590 --> 10:14.970]  is shrimp. We're about to have a lot of fun on this show, folks. Nick, what did you think a prawn
[10:14.970 --> 10:20.390]  was? It's like a big shrimp, right? Yeah, it is a shrimp. I think that's the exact same creature.
[10:20.710 --> 10:24.290]  I feel like in England, I always heard shrimp when it was like the tiny ones and you get like
[10:24.290 --> 10:28.130]  40 of them. And then a prawn would be like you're dealing with them individually.
[10:28.850 --> 10:35.130]  America's fucking up. What did you think? What did you think it was? Seafood. Right.
[10:36.690 --> 10:41.230]  That's right. Scampi. Wait, no, that's a type. Damn it. Hold on. Think about it.
[10:43.590 --> 10:48.250]  What is a prawn to you? Seafood words? What's the animal though?
[10:50.710 --> 10:54.130]  Seabug? Yes. I mean, I agree with that.
[10:55.010 --> 10:58.730]  You wouldn't look down into the sea and be like, oh, it's a school of scampi.
[11:00.730 --> 11:04.550]  Look at the scampi scamper. Look at all that dinner down there.
[11:06.890 --> 11:11.450]  To me, it's like when you see a shrimp, that's a peter dinklage. But when you see a prawn,
[11:11.530 --> 11:15.490]  that's a the rock. It's just your version of the same thing.
[11:15.970 --> 11:20.710]  Nick is saying, OK, and like we're like we're painting this picture for him now.
[11:20.710 --> 11:28.190]  I'm not asking about now. I'm asking about before. Like what was what's the what's the
[11:28.190 --> 11:34.830]  thing that's round that they make that seafood scallops? Yeah. Yeah. I was like, maybe it's a
[11:34.830 --> 11:38.470]  scallop. See, I can't fuck with those. I'm allergic to scallops, but I love prawns.
[11:39.190 --> 11:45.110]  How is a prawn or a shrimp? What did you think? Yeah. What did you think a scallop was in your
[11:45.110 --> 11:49.510]  head? The shrimp was the scallop or the prawn was a scallop? The prawn. You thought the prawn
[11:49.510 --> 11:53.310]  was a scallop. Oh, I thought maybe it was like it. I don't know. Have you heard of King Prawn?
[11:54.070 --> 11:59.030]  No. What's that? It's a big ass shrimp, dude. It's the biggest shrimp you've ever seen in your
[11:59.030 --> 12:03.250]  life. Why the fuck don't we call it prawns here? I had some in Australia once and it was too much
[12:03.250 --> 12:07.610]  for me. I couldn't take it. We could have Gulf prawns. We call them Gulf shrimp, but they're
[12:07.610 --> 12:13.010]  huge. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I think it's just I just I think that Andrew's assessment is correct
[12:13.010 --> 12:16.890]  that a prawn is like a large version of a shrimp. I just in America, I feel like we just refer to
[12:16.890 --> 12:20.810]  everything as shrimp. Maybe maybe it's like a different class of the same species or something.
[12:21.130 --> 12:25.130]  Okay. I don't even think it's a class thing. I think I think it's like what you guys are saying
[12:25.130 --> 12:31.470]  is right. The smallest shrimp, the biggest prawn. But Nick didn't know that. But he also didn't know
[12:31.470 --> 12:37.350]  what it was to begin with. Can I be vulnerable for a minute minute and reveal a irrational fear?
[12:37.810 --> 12:42.650]  Whenever I give out a food allergy, I have I get nervous internally because I feel like I'm
[12:42.650 --> 12:48.450]  setting somebody up for a silent assassin and hit man. I'm just teeing him up. I'm giving him my
[12:48.450 --> 12:58.970]  weaknesses. How many food allergies do you have? Uh, three or four. You got milk, milk, corn, salmon
[12:58.970 --> 13:04.390]  and scallops. Whoa, two sea things. You're allergic to all the same shit my dog is.
[13:05.550 --> 13:09.290]  Me and Albert. You want to I can come over and give you shots every ten days.
[13:09.290 --> 13:14.830]  Yeah, well, those are my picks. I'm happy with my board. All right. Well, there you go. Well,
[13:15.530 --> 13:20.830]  Nick, you have the next pick in your four course meal draft. Well, I've seen that the second course
[13:20.830 --> 13:27.870]  is typically a soup or a salad. So I'm right for a salad in this instance. And I went with a classic
[13:27.870 --> 13:34.890]  blue cheese wedge sides. Oh, start this meal off when you open with blue. I thought you were
[13:34.890 --> 13:40.990]  doing another bloom. I thought we were like blooming cheese or something. Oh, now we're
[13:40.990 --> 13:53.530]  talking, though. A blue cheese wedge salad. Now, is it blue, B-L-U-E or E-U? I think it's E-U.
[13:53.950 --> 13:57.890]  I thought so, too. And then my autocorrect changed it to this. So I'm really not sure.
[13:58.130 --> 14:03.850]  But there you go. Anyway, great pick. I think that's a really good pick. I love like I think
[14:03.850 --> 14:11.130]  wedge salad is nice. I think having everything on it like that is a top. You guys much you guys
[14:11.610 --> 14:16.230]  salad guys or no? I disagree with that. Yeah, big time. I love salad. OK, that's what I wanted to
[14:16.230 --> 14:21.750]  hear. Gavin, what's up with that? The wedge is just too much less. The ratio is off. Are you
[14:21.750 --> 14:26.570]  looking at this picture here, Gavin? You can you can make that last. The picture with the New
[14:26.570 --> 14:31.930]  Zealand flag by it or Australia, whatever that is. Yeah. Yes. It's a shitload of lettuce. It's a
[14:31.930 --> 14:38.590]  shitload of sauce. Sauce? Dressing, whatever, man. Come on. Oh, prawn. I'm just looking for a condiment.
[14:39.010 --> 14:43.170]  That's a shitload of pedantic. Are you are you saying the problem is it's too much to eat?
[14:43.570 --> 14:47.390]  Yeah, it's just too much lettuce to eat. Oh, he's just saying that wedge salad is too big.
[14:47.570 --> 14:51.490]  You do realize there are size portions, though, like this isn't you could get a size. I just mean
[14:51.490 --> 14:56.530]  the ratios of the lettuce to everything else is like really high. In Gavin's defense, I would say
[14:56.530 --> 15:02.550]  I think the wedge salad is typically way too much over indexes on lettuce compared to other salads
[15:02.550 --> 15:07.370]  and is always comically big. Yeah, that's fair, I suppose. Like anytime I go to a steak restaurant
[15:07.370 --> 15:11.330]  and I see one. Yeah, his first pick was Bloomin' Onion. It's already huge. So we're going with like
[15:11.330 --> 15:16.930]  Nick's just picking big meal stuff. Yeah, Nick is picking Nick portion. Yeah, 100 percent. Yeah,
[15:16.930 --> 15:20.370]  there's monkey money in here. He's going crazy. We're going big and then going home.
[15:20.970 --> 15:27.430]  I'm not going home for a long time. Well, there you go. That's Nick's pick is the blue cheese

[16:11.610 --> 16:16.150]  direction from you guys, but that's fine. My four course meal, my next up, I want like a little
[16:16.150 --> 16:20.210]  appetizer-y kind of thing, but something that's like, you're right, because it is soup salad,
[16:20.430 --> 16:24.190]  so I need something that's going to fill you up just a little bit after the appetizer. We're
[16:24.190 --> 16:30.630]  going with a french fry. Uh, that is, that specifically, top-notch french fries right there.
[16:31.010 --> 16:35.190]  Those are the ones that I'm eating. That's what I'm serving. That's my four course right here.
[16:35.690 --> 16:40.210]  Crack open a Coors Banquet, sit down, you're having a couple of sips, and I go, are you ready for
[16:40.210 --> 16:43.830]  your next course? And you can go, I'm still working on the first, and I go, don't worry about it. And
[16:43.830 --> 16:50.330]  I just put down a plate of french fries in front of you. Incredible, incredible second course for
[16:50.330 --> 16:56.170]  you to be working on my four course meal draft. Thoughts on french fries? Well, which course are
[16:56.170 --> 17:00.250]  you ordering from in the menu? Because it can't be on the sides, surely? Right, this is the salad
[17:00.250 --> 17:08.490]  portion. Okay. I'm not sure what confusion is. Soup, Coors Banquet, salad, french fry. Okay.
[17:08.490 --> 17:12.310]  Okay. I'm not sure what the confusion, I think it makes perfect sense.
[17:14.750 --> 17:19.310]  Hey, don't, it's his perfect meal. That's right. Who are we to judge? It's his four course meal,
[17:19.430 --> 17:23.670]  yeah, we can't. Who are we to judge? That's what we do, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, judge it all you
[17:23.670 --> 17:30.950]  want, just know, like Andrew said earlier, I'm right. There is a vibe to Eric's board that I
[17:30.950 --> 17:38.830]  really like. Yeah. Yeah, it's probably like divorce dad, but I do like it. I think Eric's
[17:38.830 --> 17:43.930]  four courses so far he could eat leaning on a counter. Oh yeah, that's mostly how I eat,
[17:43.990 --> 17:48.250]  that's mostly how I eat my meals. Do you not eat leaning on a counter? I could do that with mine,
[17:48.310 --> 17:54.150]  what are you talking about? What are you sitting like a bitch? Yeah, I guess,
[17:54.670 --> 17:57.790]  well, I think prawn cocktail, I'm never just like leading.
[18:00.850 --> 18:07.650]  He's sitting like a bitch. Oh man, well, french fries is in the draft and now we go to Gavin.
[18:07.850 --> 18:12.350]  Let's see where he's going in this four course meal draft. To be honest, once I'm done with my
[18:12.350 --> 18:18.330]  start, I just want to get tucked in. I'm going to get tucked in, what? Time to tuck Gavin in.
[18:18.570 --> 18:22.350]  I want to go to sleep and get in bed. No, I'm going to just get started on the main.
[18:23.230 --> 18:30.230]  My second course, meat. Okay, so are we saying steak? If you want to be specific, that's a bone
[18:30.230 --> 18:36.930]  in fillet with peppercorn sauce. Okay, okay. And I just find that to be delicious, or a fillet is
[18:36.930 --> 18:42.490]  I would say. So you had a specific thing in mind, but you just described it as meat was the move?
[18:42.550 --> 18:47.270]  He just wanted to block everybody else from doing that. Just want everyone to shut the fuck up and
[18:47.270 --> 18:51.630]  point out that there's french fries on that plate. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, it can come with a side.
[18:52.590 --> 18:57.490]  I mean, I'm not arguing with you. It's fine. I think he clearly went to your place, Eric,
[18:57.590 --> 19:02.690]  and he brought that with him. Exactly. Yeah, he grabbed all my french fries and then sat down
[19:02.690 --> 19:07.990]  and started eating his bone in fillet. I've reached over to the counter. You were hosting a very
[19:07.990 --> 19:16.830]  specific bring your own steak event. You provided the fries. I mean, the main course can come with
[19:16.830 --> 19:21.870]  sides still, right? Yeah, it's a side. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Incredible. It's on the side. Incredible.
[19:22.050 --> 19:28.350]  Incredible. It is on the side. Maybe add with fries. That is a really bad deal. With fries,
[19:28.430 --> 19:33.570]  then. To do a split of steak and fries and have one person cover all the steak expenses and the
[19:33.570 --> 19:41.290]  other one is on fries. I got the fries, guys. Don't worry about it. Well, Gavin, with the bone
[19:41.290 --> 19:47.370]  in fillet, with peppercorn sauce, with fries, with his second pick. But now that Jeff has had some
[19:47.370 --> 19:51.850]  time to come up with his next three, we're going to see what his next two are. Oh, I'm way ahead
[19:51.850 --> 19:56.970]  of you. You have the second course and the third course. I'm way I'm although I don't worry. I got
[19:56.970 --> 20:00.790]  the second course on lockdown. Right, right, right. You had time to come up with it. I got plenty of
[20:00.790 --> 20:05.110]  time between second and third course to figure that out. The second course for me, I'm going in
[20:05.110 --> 20:09.230]  the same vein as Gavin because I need to. Well, there's a very specific structure to how I want
[20:09.230 --> 20:13.150]  to work this. And so I got to go straight from my main as well. And similarly to Gavin, I'm going
[20:13.150 --> 20:20.310]  bovine. But I'm going with the ultimate cut of beef. The best of the bunch. It doesn't get any better
[20:20.310 --> 20:28.570]  than a perfectly cooked prime rib. Oh, prime rib. Good pick. Are you a prime rib guy, Jeff?
[20:28.910 --> 20:35.770]  Yeah, I love to cook it. I love to eat it. I eat it as food and I enjoy it.
[20:35.770 --> 20:42.550]  Andrew, you ever had prime rib? I don't. I don't think so. Not with the bone, certainly. Yeah, I
[20:42.550 --> 20:45.970]  haven't either. You've never had prime rib, Nick? Oh, I've had it. I've never had it with the bone.
[20:45.990 --> 20:49.470]  With the bone. Yeah, I've had prime rib, just never with the bone. Well, never bone in.
[20:49.630 --> 20:53.510]  Like they slice off some for you, though, right? But how am I supposed to hold it?
[20:55.030 --> 21:03.910]  It's a joke. I saw the look on your face. I was stunned. I was stunned. He said it. I was stunned.
[21:03.910 --> 21:10.610]  I didn't know what to say. Well, prime rib has made the list. That's Jeff's second course. But
[21:10.610 --> 21:17.430]  because of sneak draft, Jeff gets the third course first. So, Jeff, where are you going next?
[21:17.610 --> 21:23.030]  Exactly as I wanted. I get the third course first. This is how I planned it. This is how I conceived
[21:23.030 --> 21:29.450]  the whole evening. My heart tells me to go mashed potato as a side, but I'm looking at my meal and
[21:29.450 --> 21:33.830]  I'm trying to make a complete meal here and I feel like there's not enough greenery on my plate.
[21:33.910 --> 21:38.250]  I just have some tomato in the bruschetta, really, and just the tiniest bit of parsley.
[21:38.630 --> 21:44.450]  So I just I don't want to I know I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but I'm also a meat and
[21:44.450 --> 21:50.010]  Brussels sprouts kind of guy. And so I'm going crispy Brussels sprouts. OK, I like that. As my
[21:50.750 --> 21:57.690]  third course, you ordered it when we went to when we went out for steak at our steak dinner. I
[21:57.690 --> 22:04.610]  ordered crispy Brussels sprouts. That is good. I love I love a Brussels sprout in this fantastic.
[22:05.130 --> 22:11.110]  Why are you laughing, Gavin? This is a course that's insane. Yeah, I will say it's a side.
[22:11.470 --> 22:14.950]  Yeah, I think it's great. It's a side. Exactly. That's what I'm ordering. This is my side.
[22:15.070 --> 22:21.150]  This is my side course. I could be with you as one thing. Jeff, Jeff, don't listen to these fools.
[22:21.230 --> 22:25.230]  How can it be part of my main course? I think it's a great pick. I think it's a great pick.
[22:25.230 --> 22:30.290]  What the fuck are you talking about? Fantastic pick. And also I'm going to pick these nine things and make
[22:30.290 --> 22:34.730]  them one course. That's not how it works, dude. That's why it's called a course. Yeah, it's a course.
[22:35.230 --> 22:40.710]  Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. It's not a four item meal. You're a four item meal. Oh, yeah.
[22:45.850 --> 22:49.290]  Before we move away from Brussels sprout, I just want to say, Jeff, you make a delicious
[22:49.290 --> 22:54.590]  grilled Brussels sprout. I've never had a better one than the Brussels sprout I had made by you.
[22:54.590 --> 23:03.750]  Thank you very much, Andrew. I'm sorry. What year was that? 2016? 2015? Okay. Andrew actually
[23:03.750 --> 23:07.970]  knew me when I was a better cook. I used to cook a hell of a lot more than I do now. That's what
[23:07.970 --> 23:10.410]  I was going to ask is, do you think you've improved? Because I'd love for you to take
[23:10.410 --> 23:14.030]  another crack at it. Oh, I cook Brussels sprouts all the time, but I'm not as good as I used to be.
[23:15.930 --> 23:20.230]  Every time I cook a steak, I cook Brussels sprouts. Dang. Anytime I see Brussels sprouts,
[23:20.230 --> 23:22.850]  I think they won't be as good as Jeff's, and they've never been.
[23:23.390 --> 23:26.530]  Jeff's best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. Kindest thing you've ever said to me. Delicious.
[23:29.790 --> 23:35.510]  Well, now that Gavin's done sniping at Jeff, he has the next pick, his third course here
[23:35.510 --> 23:43.230]  in the four course meal draft. Thinking about it? Gavin? Giving yourself a little bit of a reboot?
[23:43.630 --> 23:47.190]  Well, I want to make sure that we don't talk at the same time. So we're going to give Gavin
[23:47.190 --> 23:53.970]  all the space in the world to say what he has to say. Cocktail sauce. He's going with a cocktail
[23:53.970 --> 24:02.470]  prawn for his third pick. For me, I'm after my main, you know, after I've got some meat and fries
[24:02.470 --> 24:09.010]  down my neck. I want dessert. That's next for me. I'm having a little chocolate fondue,
[24:09.170 --> 24:14.170]  dipping stuff in melted chocolate. Delicious. Bit of fruit in there. Perfect. That's dessert.
[24:14.170 --> 24:19.850]  Take me to the melting pot. That is my dessert. Chocolate fondue. I would have it like a, you know,
[24:19.910 --> 24:27.490]  one of the actively hot pots, though, and not just like in a bowl. Oh, you big fondue guy?
[24:27.810 --> 24:32.230]  I don't mind it. I don't think I've ever had fondue. Jeff, any thoughts on chocolate fondue?
[24:33.230 --> 24:38.450]  I mean, I'm not crazy about it. I think it's a weird way to defend it by saying,
[24:38.510 --> 24:41.610]  do you like it? And have you go, I'm not mad at it. I don't hate it.
[24:41.610 --> 24:46.290]  Is it like a whole meal? I could, you know, give or take the rest. But the dessert's wicked.
[24:46.710 --> 24:50.990]  Now is the fondue at the table or do you have a fondue fountain in this place that you have to go
[24:50.990 --> 24:57.650]  to? If someone wheeled out like a currently running chocolate fountain, that'd be incredible.
[24:58.150 --> 25:03.570]  That would be such a cool move. A restaurant where you could order fondue for the restaurant. Like
[25:03.570 --> 25:08.510]  they just wheel it out and it's anyone's welcome to just get some fondue going. Next round's on me.
[25:08.510 --> 25:14.310]  You know, going for the dessert like right here. Interesting. I'm very curious to see where Gavin
[25:14.310 --> 25:18.390]  goes with his fourth course. Oh, I think I know where he's going. Gavin's fourth course is going
[25:18.390 --> 25:22.750]  to be a McDonald's cheeseburger on his way home from the restaurant because he was still hungry.
[25:22.770 --> 25:29.730]  Yeah, no kidding. Yep. And speaking of, Andrew, I think that's a very interesting point because
[25:29.730 --> 25:37.490]  my pick is next and it's two or three hamburgers. So is that... I love that it's top-notch.
[25:37.490 --> 25:44.110]  Yep. Is that total for the party or is it how many each person is? No, per person. Yeah,
[25:44.230 --> 25:49.270]  per person. You're allowed to have like two or three hamburgers. You can have one if you want,
[25:49.390 --> 25:54.670]  but just know you're able to have like two or three hamburgers. This draft is making me realize
[25:54.670 --> 25:59.510]  how much I hang out with Gavin's wife without Gavin. I just went to top-notch with Meg like
[25:59.510 --> 26:08.770]  three days ago. I couldn't go because I was editing the gumbler. Man. I was just at that
[26:08.770 --> 26:17.150]  restaurant with your wife. That's really something. That's really something. Eric is just taking me
[26:17.150 --> 26:22.770]  deeper into the divorce dad territory of we're at his place. He's got the quarters,
[26:23.190 --> 26:27.870]  putting some french fries in the oven. The George Foreman grill is on the counter ready to go.
[26:27.870 --> 26:34.250]  Listen, I think that it's important that everyone get what they want. And two or three hamburgers is
[26:34.250 --> 26:40.170]  what I want. So I hope you want that also. If your fourth course isn't a store-bought dessert,
[26:40.410 --> 26:47.650]  I'm going to be very disappointed. You'll have to wait and see. You ever go and buy a whole birthday
[26:47.650 --> 26:52.830]  cake from a Vaughn's? You're about to see something. But before we get to my fourth course,
[26:52.870 --> 26:57.310]  we have to get to Nick's third. Nick, what's your third course? Well, this is the main course,
[26:57.310 --> 27:03.450]  it is the main course. You know, the main dish. And of course, you get a couple sides with that.
[27:03.530 --> 27:09.890]  And in this instance, I'm going to go with a ribeye, a loaded baked potato, and some
[27:11.090 --> 27:16.190]  broccoli. I'm starting to see kind of what Nick's ideal meal is just at one place where he could go
[27:16.190 --> 27:20.530]  right now if he wanted. What do you mean? This is something to make at home. Nick's ideal meal
[27:20.530 --> 27:26.550]  is the buffet at Golden Corral. Just have a look at that. Yeah, look at that lower right-hand
[27:26.550 --> 27:30.570]  corner of that cutting board. What do you mean? Look at the inside of Nick here. I have an
[27:30.570 --> 27:35.410]  extensive collection of cutting boards. Yeah. OK, what am I what am I listing this as, Nick?
[27:36.630 --> 27:46.270]  Ribeye with fully loaded baked potato. Oh no, it's too far gone, buddy. And broccoli. And
[27:46.270 --> 27:52.210]  forget. It's not enough room to autopsy that potato on that plate, though, like your wife did.
[27:52.210 --> 28:00.970]  No, no, she can't flay it like Ramsey. She would put that steak on Nick's plate and then
[28:00.970 --> 28:04.390]  do her whole potato thing. Were you there?
[28:07.950 --> 28:13.390]  All right, well, I'm really getting a look at the inside of Nick, but it's something that I already
[28:13.390 --> 28:18.330]  knew and sort of what I expected. It's fucking greasy and full of cholesterol. Yeah, it's exactly
[28:18.330 --> 28:24.870]  what I thought it would be. Are you my doctor? Andrew, you get the last pick of the third
[28:24.870 --> 28:30.670]  course, but you also get the first final course. So how are you going to kick off your third course
[28:30.670 --> 28:36.890]  here? I'm trying to decide if I could be so bold as to claim a vegetable medley as part of my dish.
[28:37.690 --> 28:42.630]  But I feel like that. Yeah, that's a yeah by you. I feel like that's like eight picks in one.
[28:42.630 --> 28:51.830]  OK, well, then I am going to go with a chicken parmesan with twice baked potato and
[28:52.970 --> 28:56.930]  vegetable medley. That is my main. So what was the issue? What was the fear with the
[28:56.930 --> 29:01.790]  vegetable medley that it couldn't be a part of it? Because I'm technically taking broccoli and
[29:01.790 --> 29:07.150]  carrots and like he's taking the produce aisle green bean. I'm taking a bunch. Yeah, it's a lot.
[29:07.550 --> 29:11.990]  It's a lot of things. But it's all it's all baked into a small enough portion to be one thing. Sure.
[29:11.990 --> 29:15.890]  That's fair. I just from this point, you know, like I've been taking very specific items, but I
[29:15.890 --> 29:21.830]  see you going with the ribeye and fully baked and Gavin with the filet, whatever, peppercorn with
[29:21.830 --> 29:28.690]  fries. So I'm going to add a few to mine as well as a main course. That is my main course. Of course.
[29:28.990 --> 29:33.970]  I think it's great. That's that's a lot going on, too, with the chicken parm. That's a you got a
[29:33.970 --> 29:39.670]  whole meal going on right there. Do you? Yep. Yeah. Pretty, pretty heavy stuff. But stuff that stuff
[29:39.670 --> 29:49.230]  that looks pretty good. Your ear bud fell in a coffee cup. You need a taco. Pick me up when modern
[29:49.230 --> 29:57.230]  life gets rough. Grab the timeless taste of love. I saw the old El Paso. At LinkedIn, we know hiring

[30:27.270 --> 30:31.410]  a that's a lot. You're stacked up on your three courses. How are you rounding us out here?
[30:31.410 --> 30:36.670]  There's a lot of different ways you can go at dessert. I'm not the biggest dessert fan,
[30:38.030 --> 30:45.130]  so it's tough. It's difficult because when I lean dessert, I typically go with like a pie,
[30:45.250 --> 30:50.290]  but I don't feel like that's fitting. So I am going to draft as part of my theme
[30:50.930 --> 30:56.270]  a space cake. What's a space cake? I think it's a cake with weed in it from what I'm googling.
[30:58.530 --> 31:07.490]  I googled space cake and it says belonging to a group of cannabis infused edibles. So I bought
[31:07.490 --> 31:11.650]  the space cake thinking it's a goofy name. Everybody's getting high. I didn't know. I'm
[31:11.650 --> 31:15.710]  not aware of what's going on. We're just really we're topping out this experience in an unexpected
[31:15.710 --> 31:23.270]  way. And that concludes my theme. Hey, hey, I've never been blindsided.
[31:27.990 --> 31:32.310]  That was a frontside blindside. So this is this is what I'm thinking with my thing. I kind of
[31:32.310 --> 31:37.230]  got a thing going here where the bread bread is just there. As Gavin said, it is you show up,
[31:37.250 --> 31:41.370]  but it's there. But I feel like it's a key part. I want to make sure I have it from that point on.
[31:41.370 --> 31:49.810]  We went from the sea with the barbecue bacon wrapped prawn. Then we got a bird as well as
[31:49.810 --> 31:54.130]  with the potato, something from the earth, something from the ground. So we concluded
[31:54.810 --> 32:00.410]  this four course experience going to outer space with the space cake. Everybody's getting high off
[32:00.410 --> 32:06.870]  the cake. I wanted to cover multiple layers. I wanted to see. I wanted ground. I wanted air.
[32:06.870 --> 32:12.490]  And now we're in space to round out this fourth course. Are you the Winston Churchill of four
[32:12.490 --> 32:18.270]  course meals? I sure am, Nick, and I'm glad you're finally seeing it. Really incredible.
[32:18.710 --> 32:21.790]  Wow. All the elements are present in Andrew. Absolutely.
[32:22.970 --> 32:26.530]  Andrew brings the heart. That's the food pyramid, of course.
[32:30.110 --> 32:35.330]  Well, Andrew's rounded out his four courses here. Very interesting. And now it's time for Nick
[32:35.330 --> 32:38.570]  to take us down under and let us know what his fourth course is.
[32:38.690 --> 32:43.490]  Oh, it's funny you should mention that because I, uh, dessert. One of my favorite things. I love
[32:43.490 --> 32:49.350]  dessert. Chocolate cake. Excellent pick. I love chocolate cake, but specifically this type of
[32:49.350 --> 32:58.090]  chocolate cake, which is, of course, the chocolate thunder from down under. Is that cake? Yeah,
[32:58.930 --> 33:03.110]  it's a brownie, actually. Okay. With a bunch of ice cream and then whipped cream
[33:03.110 --> 33:07.670]  like fudgy. It looks like the brownie is the least of it. Nick, once you get a slice of my
[33:07.670 --> 33:12.550]  space cake, you can call it whatever you want. It's all fine. We're all good. Is this chocolate
[33:12.550 --> 33:17.030]  thunder down under? Is that what it's called? From down under. Okay, okay. I think by the
[33:17.030 --> 33:24.970]  dessert on Nick's plate, I'm like 6,000 calories in. I mean, at least. My favorite kind of cake
[33:24.970 --> 33:30.810]  is this brownie with ice cream on it. Listen, cake is brownie. Brownie can be cake. If a shrimp
[33:30.810 --> 33:37.090]  had Nick's fourth course meal, it would be a prawn by the end of the dinner. It's bulking up.
[33:38.430 --> 33:43.250]  Oh, man. Well, Nick really rounded it out there. I'm pretty impressed. He really,
[33:43.250 --> 33:47.070]  he stayed in one lane and he did a great job. Roll me home, baby.
[33:49.730 --> 33:53.850]  He loves it so much, too. Like, everything he picked, he would be so excited for.
[33:53.850 --> 34:00.530]  Um, well, I've had a like an appetizer. There's like a soup salad kind of situation. And then
[34:00.530 --> 34:05.730]  we got the main course. And you're full. You're stuffed. You're like, Oh, I've been I keep having
[34:05.730 --> 34:12.270]  I've had about six or seven appetizers with my salad and and and my main course. So you're
[34:12.270 --> 34:17.330]  really feeling full. So it's time for an aperitif to sort of round. Yeah, to round this out. And
[34:17.330 --> 34:23.690]  there's only one aperitif for me. And that's Coors Light to round this thing out. You don't
[34:23.690 --> 34:28.410]  want something too heavy. You don't want something that's going to weigh you down. You've already
[34:28.410 --> 34:34.990]  had a pretty filling meal and now it's just time to, you know, crack a cold one. The mountains
[34:34.990 --> 34:40.430]  are blue and have a nice time with your friends as you wind down the evening and celebrate
[34:41.450 --> 34:46.170]  responsibly. Can you imagine taking someone on a date to a fancy restaurant and the four courses
[34:46.170 --> 34:51.590]  of what Eric picked and each one comes out with like a little cloche? Hey, it's how he got married.
[34:51.590 --> 34:55.810]  Who said anything? Who said anything about a fancy restaurant? This is a four course meal draft, baby.
[34:56.030 --> 35:01.410]  Yeah, I would just love to see that happen at a restaurant and I'd love to see the woman's
[35:01.410 --> 35:07.570]  reaction. I mean, the dude's married, so it clearly worked. It worked, baby. Yep. Hey, the only
[35:07.570 --> 35:13.330]  banquet we need is Coors Banquet. Guys, those are my four courses. Eric's restaurant, coincidentally,
[35:13.470 --> 35:20.070]  is a place that his parents live above. It's he's just... Right, they do, but they don't own it.
[35:20.070 --> 35:25.570]  Some call it a suite, some call it a restaurant. I don't know. That's right. I call it the downstairs
[35:25.570 --> 35:33.970]  neighbor's house. His name is Dave and we hang out. Those are my four courses, but it's time for
[35:33.970 --> 35:39.430]  Gavin to round us out with his fourth and final course in this four course meal draft. My fourth
[35:39.430 --> 35:45.750]  and final course is a two stage course. Okay, that's... I want two things from this. So it's a five course
[35:45.750 --> 35:53.410]  meal. Okay. Let's see what you think. What I want is the check and a lovely cup of tea at home.
[35:53.630 --> 36:01.310]  And that's course four. I'm gonna say yeah. I'm gonna agree with this. Go for it, man. Yeah,
[36:01.350 --> 36:06.610]  no, I'm all for this because now I know that Gavin will lose this draft no matter the fan love for
[36:06.610 --> 36:15.730]  this guy. What a dump of a final course on a fantastic meal that he could have had. I'd like
[36:15.730 --> 36:20.610]  it. And then I'd like everyone to check it out because cheeseburger is on the check,
[36:20.730 --> 36:24.590]  which is the thing that I have. And so that's fine. It's not a big deal. Hey,
[36:25.570 --> 36:30.350]  you come. You come eat at my restaurant, guys. Gavin picks it up. All right, Gavin,
[36:30.490 --> 36:34.490]  maybe you can save it. Maybe you can save it. What kind of tea? No, he can't. Oh, it's okay.
[36:34.910 --> 36:39.230]  There's no saving it. Solid tea. That's a solid tea. Oh yeah. Oh, there's no saving it. Yeah.
[36:41.130 --> 36:43.990]  This is going to sound a lot harsher than I mean, Gavin,
[36:43.990 --> 36:47.830]  but I think that might be the worst pick anyone has ever made in any of these drafts.
[36:48.830 --> 36:55.330]  Cup of tea? Gavin, he's on your side. Check and a cup of tea at home. I don't want to eat four
[36:55.330 --> 36:59.430]  courses. I've done it three. I completely get where you're coming from. I just think it's the
[36:59.430 --> 37:04.830]  worst pick anyone's ever made. I mean, yeah. And I don't mean that aggressively. You can have it
[37:04.830 --> 37:10.110]  like it's, you know, I can see where you're coming from. But this is the man who who made
[37:10.110 --> 37:16.330]  fun of Crack Rock. Yeah, I was wrong. I was on the wrong side of history of Crack Rock. If you
[37:16.330 --> 37:22.330]  presented me with with this as a meal itinerary, I'd freaking love that. That sounds incredible.
[37:22.870 --> 37:29.370]  Wait, so if I presented you with that, am I saying that I'm going to leave and pay for your meal
[37:30.130 --> 37:36.390]  in that context? Like, that's what's weird about it is I feel like I'm giving you our dinner plans
[37:36.390 --> 37:41.910]  and also what I plan to do as soon as we're done. Well, I'm looking at that and I'm thinking
[37:41.910 --> 37:45.770]  that's a meal that's going to be slightly shorter than all the others. And I think that's brilliant.
[37:46.670 --> 37:50.650]  I just I'd be looking at it going, does he want me to go to his house?
[37:51.530 --> 37:57.110]  Am I supposed to have tea with him? Yes. Are we invited to your house for tea? Is he just telling
[37:57.110 --> 38:02.830]  me that what his plans are after we have the dinner? It is a bit confusing. It is kind of odd.
[38:02.830 --> 38:08.530]  Should I just put a cup of tea at home? I mean, are we invited to the tea? Gavin,
[38:08.630 --> 38:12.770]  when do you think the courses stop? Am I selling this meal or am I eating this meal?
[38:12.950 --> 38:16.410]  That's you know what? I think that's for you to set up. Is this in your home? Are you presenting
[38:16.410 --> 38:20.550]  this at your house? I just was drafting a four course meal that I would want to eat.
[38:20.790 --> 38:27.270]  You want to eat the check? Wow. Yum, yum. Hell of a pick, Gav. Hell of a pick. Great, great final
[38:28.630 --> 38:33.050]  awesome, awesome. I stand by my pick. I think it's a wicked final course.
[38:33.550 --> 38:37.750]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I stand by your pick also. Way to go. I think everybody's standing
[38:37.750 --> 38:41.330]  by your pick. Yeah, I think everyone's standing by your pick. Yeah, great work. Ten toes down.
[38:41.770 --> 38:47.090]  Yeah, that's for sure. Well, Jeff is standing on business as he rounds out his fourth and final
[38:47.090 --> 38:51.690]  course here and he's going to end the four course meal draft. Jeff, take us out big style. So my
[38:51.690 --> 38:58.430]  fourth and final course is it's a newer one for me. It's a bit aspirational, but I feel like it
[38:58.430 --> 39:05.230]  also is related to the maturation process of Jeff. Something you may not know about me is that I'm a
[39:05.230 --> 39:10.190]  big dessert guy. Now, I didn't used to be a big dessert guy. That has come to me later in life
[39:10.190 --> 39:15.090]  for one specific reason that I bet a lot of people don't know is that when you're an alcoholic,
[39:15.570 --> 39:20.450]  one of the things that you become super addicted to, obviously the alcohol. The other thing is the
[39:20.450 --> 39:27.910]  sugar in alcohol. There's so much sugar in alcohol. I never was into candy or sweets growing up.
[39:28.510 --> 39:34.650]  But after I got sober, I developed a sweet tooth that has just beaten the shit out of me for the
[39:34.650 --> 39:39.350]  last couple of years. And so I'm trying to break free of that. I'm tempted to pick a banana split.
[39:39.470 --> 39:44.150]  I'm tempted to pick a slice of cheesecake. I'm scared that you guys are going to Gavin me here
[39:44.150 --> 39:51.430]  for this. But my final pick is going to be an aperitif as well. I just want, I'm trying to
[39:51.430 --> 39:57.290]  teach myself to appreciate the simplicity of a little espresso. Oh, I think that's a great pick.
[39:57.670 --> 40:04.810]  Oh, what a finale. Yeah, I think that's a great pick. Fantastic. Yeah, I think that's phenomenal.
[40:05.610 --> 40:10.750]  Here's the thing, because you can sit, you can sip, you're still hanging out, you're winding
[40:10.750 --> 40:14.470]  down the evening, people, people see it and they go, Oh, isn't it a little late for that? And you
[40:14.470 --> 40:18.750]  go, Oh, no, as an end to the meal, you need it because you're dragging just a hair. Let's have
[40:18.750 --> 40:23.770]  some sips. Let's walk it off. Let's enjoy this evening air together. Jeff, I think a little
[40:23.770 --> 40:28.530]  espresso is a great pick. I love it. Thank you. That's what I picked. But just with half as much
[40:28.530 --> 40:34.710]  caffeine. No, no, no. You pick the check and go home. Jeff is enjoying. I'm still at the dinner
[40:34.710 --> 40:41.070]  table. Jeff is enjoying the night, regaling us with tales. Things unheard. I'm telling stories
[40:41.070 --> 40:45.150]  about Gavin now that he's gone. What if I just picked check and cup of tea at the restaurant?
[40:45.510 --> 40:48.370]  Yeah, I mean, that would have made more sense. Yeah, I think that would have been a way better
[40:48.370 --> 40:53.430]  pick. Pick it. So it's the at home because now we're locked in on the four-courth meal draft.
[40:53.770 --> 40:59.950]  You dummy. We've done it. We've drafted all four courses, all five of us, which we did not
[40:59.950 --> 41:05.750]  randomize 20 times, only four. And this is how we landed. These are Jeff's four courses. Let us
[41:05.750 --> 41:10.770]  know in the comments who had the best four-course meal. And as Gavin will tell you later, there's a
[41:10.770 --> 41:19.190]  poll that you're able to vote in. Here's the pick order. Jeff, bruschetta, prime rib, crispy brussel
[41:19.190 --> 41:23.930]  sprouts, and a little espresso. Beautiful. Excellent. Gavin, I'm starting strong with the
[41:23.930 --> 41:30.590]  prawn cocktail, then bone-in filet with peppercorn sauce with fries, chocolate fondue, and rounding
[41:30.590 --> 41:38.730]  out with the check and a cup of tea at home. I have picked Coors Banquet, french fries, two or
[41:38.730 --> 41:43.190]  three hamburgers, and Coors Light. Yeah, I know. I agree. I have some great picks. Those are great
[41:43.190 --> 41:47.850]  picks from me. And here's Nick. Nick is going out back and down under as we take it to the blooming
[41:47.850 --> 41:52.970]  onion, the blue cheese wedge salad, ribeye with fully loaded baked potato and broccoli, and
[41:52.970 --> 42:02.470]  finally the chocolate thunder down under. Down under. Okay. And Andrew, focaccia, bacon, barbecue,
[42:02.690 --> 42:08.790]  wrapped prawns, chicken parmesan with twice-baked potato and vegetable medley, and finally rounding
[42:08.790 --> 42:14.050]  it out with the space cake. Hey Gavin, you know what my check is? You know how expensive my meal is?
[42:15.470 --> 42:18.410]  You know how expensive you've been paid? $4.20, baby!
[42:29.350 --> 42:40.910]  Man, that turned out so much better than I thought it would. A fantastic dinner for all of us. The
[42:40.910 --> 42:46.110]  Four Course Meal Draft. So different, each and every one of us, but the only people that can let
[42:46.110 --> 42:50.870]  us know who did it best is you at home. Leave a comment, vote in the poll, tell us what your
[42:50.870 --> 42:56.070]  perfect Four Course Meal is. That's the way that you can interact with this, and then we'll finally
[42:56.070 --> 43:00.510]  see who had the best Four Course Meal, and then we will get mad at one another. Thank you guys so
[43:00.510 --> 43:06.830]  much for listening to this. Check out the Patreon at patreon.com slash the regulation pod, and you're
[43:06.830 --> 43:10.710]  going to want to listen to the podcast. But before we take it out, boys, was there anything else that
[43:10.710 --> 43:19.330]  you left off your list? Honorable mentions. I was really close to, uh, drafting check and cup of tea
[43:19.330 --> 43:26.730]  at, uh, mom's home. Maybe grandpa's house. Yeah, it's a little different. You know what? I would
[43:26.730 --> 43:30.910]  have allowed it, but, uh, it probably would have been a little bit of a fight. Ice cream sandwich
[43:30.910 --> 43:34.890]  from the gas station on the way home. That's a great pick! What are you talking about? That's
[43:34.890 --> 43:39.890]  a perfect pick. Pretty good. Check-in patrolling the streets for an ice cream truck. If you'd
[43:39.890 --> 43:45.670]  eaten a prawn cocktail, a big old slab of meat, some fries, and you'd been dunking chocolate fondue,
[43:45.930 --> 43:50.070]  where do you want to be now? In the restaurant with my friends, enjoying the end of that meal
[43:50.070 --> 43:55.270]  and sharing stories, coming up with new ideas, enjoying company. Fellowship, as we call it. Do
[43:55.270 --> 43:59.610]  that during dessert. Do that while you're eating dessert. I would feel kind of ripped off if one of
[43:59.610 --> 44:06.450]  the courses in my four-course meal was getting the check. That happens. It's part of every meal.
[44:07.170 --> 44:13.630]  And as a tea. Yeah, but that's at home. You're doing that yourself. Yeah. Garcon.
[44:14.750 --> 44:19.590]  Uh, I changed my whole draft on the fly. I was originally going with broccolini, a cranberry feta
[44:19.590 --> 44:24.430]  and walnut salad, wagyu steak, and a blueberry empanada, but, uh, Coors Banquet sounded real good
[44:24.430 --> 44:29.410]  right now, so I just went with that and kind of saw where the day took me. Um, thank you guys so much
[44:29.410 --> 44:34.550]  for listening to this. So many drafts coming down the pipe. Want to thank you for supporting us
[44:34.550 --> 44:42.270]  directly on Patreon. Pipe draft. Heard it here first. See you next time. Bye. We could do crack
[44:42.270 --> 44:43.470]  rock again. Check, please.
