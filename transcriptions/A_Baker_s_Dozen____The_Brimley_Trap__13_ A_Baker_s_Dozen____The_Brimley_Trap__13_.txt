[00:00.760 --> 00:03.400]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[00:03.740 --> 00:07.020]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[00:07.520 --> 00:09.280]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[00:09.500 --> 00:12.700]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[00:12.880 --> 00:17.160]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[00:17.420 --> 00:20.880]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[00:21.240 --> 00:23.160]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[00:26.040 --> 00:28.200]  What's the best place to get a sunburn?
[00:28.640 --> 00:30.360]  The best place to get a sunburn?
[00:30.360 --> 00:33.260]  The best place. Yeah, not the worst. The best.
[00:33.760 --> 00:34.500]  Probably your neck.
[00:35.500 --> 00:41.500]  You think that I... I'm a crinkled neck sleeper. I don't think that would work well for me.
[00:42.180 --> 00:43.660]  All right. Hold that thought.
[00:44.200 --> 00:48.360]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:48.700 --> 00:52.100]  It's a baker's dozen. Eric reminded me this is episode 13.
[00:52.540 --> 00:56.080]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton,
[00:57.420 --> 01:00.480]  Eric Baddour, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz.
[01:00.600 --> 01:04.220]  In order of importance, but from odd to even numbers.
[01:04.460 --> 01:05.380]  How's everybody doing?
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.800]  Andrew, you were asking what the best place to get a sunburn is.
[01:09.360 --> 01:12.100]  I'm just, yeah, because obviously there's a lot of bad places.
[01:12.180 --> 01:14.920]  I was trying to think of what would be a good place to get one.
[01:15.600 --> 01:16.220]  Lower back?
[01:16.440 --> 01:19.400]  Lower back's not bad.
[01:20.300 --> 01:20.820]  Lower stomach?
[01:21.340 --> 01:22.320]  Shoulders. I would say shoulders.
[01:22.320 --> 01:28.340]  I often film in that quarry and it's got very sort of chalky white ground.
[01:28.580 --> 01:33.560]  And if I don't put sunscreen on my undercarriage, it like gets on my inner thighs.
[01:33.920 --> 01:36.000]  Like the sun bounces off the ground up my shorts.
[01:36.140 --> 01:38.920]  That would be bad. That would be a bad spot for a burn.
[01:39.220 --> 01:41.200]  It's pretty rough. It's in the chafe area.
[01:42.240 --> 01:44.060]  I don't want anything in the chafe area.
[01:44.300 --> 01:47.060]  What's the worst sunburn you've ever had?
[01:47.200 --> 01:50.480]  Like, have you ever had like a big pus-filled blister?
[01:52.320 --> 01:52.800]  I have.
[01:53.520 --> 01:55.000]  You and I went different places.
[01:55.340 --> 01:57.920]  I was thinking it would be really funny to make a skin suit.
[01:58.360 --> 02:00.600]  Like if you burn your entire body.
[02:00.860 --> 02:01.460]  That is really funny.
[02:02.380 --> 02:03.460]  What do you mean?
[02:03.680 --> 02:04.480]  Fucking psycho.
[02:05.440 --> 02:08.840]  Well, if let's say your whole body burns and it peels.
[02:08.980 --> 02:10.360]  Just be like a big walking blister.
[02:10.620 --> 02:12.180]  Yeah, like how your skin peels.
[02:12.600 --> 02:16.380]  Like Christian Bale, an American psycho with the face mask.
[02:16.420 --> 02:17.780]  But it's just your whole body.
[02:18.500 --> 02:22.300]  Oh, I'm imagining like a chalk outline of a crime scene.
[02:22.420 --> 02:24.280]  It's just you skin like a snake.
[02:24.380 --> 02:26.200]  Like how a snake shed skin.
[02:26.440 --> 02:27.300]  It's horrible.
[02:27.380 --> 02:29.900]  The human shakes or snake, not shake.
[02:32.260 --> 02:34.160]  I got liquids on the brain.
[02:34.500 --> 02:39.840]  I'm drinking lightly sparkling water, which I didn't know is a thing.
[02:39.980 --> 02:41.100]  And it's terrible.
[02:41.400 --> 02:43.680]  I don't think it's like soda streamed and left overnight.
[02:44.180 --> 02:46.820]  No, it's a it's a bottled product.
[02:46.820 --> 02:49.780]  It's a canned product that is lightly sparkling.
[02:50.240 --> 02:53.040]  I didn't know that you could have a variety of sparkling types.
[02:53.340 --> 02:55.840]  It's got to be all or nothing when it comes to fizz.
[02:56.140 --> 02:56.680]  I yeah.
[02:56.860 --> 02:58.440]  Who wants less fizz?
[02:58.960 --> 03:00.800]  If I want fizz, give me all the fizz.
[03:01.840 --> 03:03.740]  This just feels flat, like you said.
[03:04.320 --> 03:05.880]  Yeah, I think fizz is all or nothing, right?
[03:05.900 --> 03:06.480]  It's all gas.
[03:06.620 --> 03:08.380]  No breaks with fizz.
[03:09.100 --> 03:09.920]  I'd agree with that.
[03:10.300 --> 03:15.220]  As a matter of fact, if it's just a little bit of fizz, it makes me think it's a bad strawberry.
[03:15.220 --> 03:15.600]  Yes.
[03:15.880 --> 03:16.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:17.540 --> 03:20.460]  You know how strawberry goes bad and it's just like a little bit of fizz.
[03:20.640 --> 03:20.920]  Yeah.
[03:22.120 --> 03:27.400]  The fact that there are other brands making lightly sparkling water deeply concerns me.
[03:28.000 --> 03:28.640]  There shouldn't.
[03:28.760 --> 03:30.340]  I was hoping it was just this weird.
[03:30.640 --> 03:32.880]  This is a chateau water.
[03:33.020 --> 03:36.120]  I thought it was just fancy, a fancy water thing.
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.380]  That's a company who found out that the CO2 cartridges started to cost way more money
[03:41.380 --> 03:43.800]  after the pandemic and tried to figure out a creative solution.
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.760]  So they use less.
[03:46.680 --> 03:47.440]  This may be creative.
[03:47.740 --> 03:48.540]  It's not good.
[03:49.020 --> 03:49.720]  Would not recommend.
[03:50.780 --> 03:54.120]  I have a beverage dilemma that isn't even in my notes, but we're talking about beverages.
[03:54.860 --> 03:56.840]  I don't know what to do about...
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.160]  I have a drink in my fridge, padded in my fridge for about four months,
[04:01.800 --> 04:04.420]  and I don't know what to do about it because it's...
[04:05.060 --> 04:06.600]  No, well, probably.
[04:07.160 --> 04:07.820]  I think it's probably...
[04:07.820 --> 04:09.460]  Before you even stop, you pour it down the sink.
[04:10.060 --> 04:11.140]  Here's the thing, though.
[04:11.300 --> 04:13.100]  This is what makes it a little bit of a wrinkle.
[04:13.100 --> 04:17.800]  It is a slush drink from a boba place.
[04:18.140 --> 04:19.520]  Oh, you got to drink it.
[04:19.780 --> 04:20.020]  Yeah.
[04:20.200 --> 04:21.300]  Yeah, you got to drink it, dude.
[04:21.320 --> 04:21.620]  For sure.
[04:21.660 --> 04:22.560]  You don't want to throw that out.
[04:23.020 --> 04:23.660]  But here's the...
[04:23.660 --> 04:24.460]  Well, it's great.
[04:24.740 --> 04:24.920]  Yeah.
[04:25.060 --> 04:26.900]  First of all, great drink, as Eric is saying.
[04:27.300 --> 04:27.920]  It would hate...
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.160]  I'd hate to make it a waste, but this is where the dilemma comes in.
[04:31.360 --> 04:32.860]  They vacuum seal it.
[04:33.120 --> 04:39.120]  It's a vacuum sealed top in a cup, so it is as sealed as it can be.
[04:39.580 --> 04:42.240]  Isn't boba typically kind of milky?
[04:42.240 --> 04:44.880]  But it's not boba, it's like a slush drink.
[04:44.980 --> 04:45.700]  It's like a Slurpee.
[04:46.220 --> 04:50.640]  I imagine somebody took a slushie and then vacuum sealed it.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.300]  But there might be some, like, strawberry puree.
[04:55.900 --> 04:59.000]  I don't know what their shelf life is on a puree.
[04:59.940 --> 05:00.640]  Oh, you got time.
[05:01.580 --> 05:02.880]  Why didn't you drink it at the time?
[05:03.800 --> 05:06.420]  Uh, I planned on drinking it the next day.
[05:06.780 --> 05:10.000]  And so I put it in my fridge and then I forgot it existed.
[05:10.560 --> 05:13.960]  And now I find it and I go, oh man, I'd hate to throw that away.
[05:14.180 --> 05:16.900]  But I don't know how this works.
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.560]  Because it's not in a bottle.
[05:18.960 --> 05:20.700]  If it was in a bottle, I would just drink it.
[05:20.800 --> 05:21.240]  It's fine.
[05:21.760 --> 05:24.400]  But it's in a cup that's been vacuum sealed.
[05:24.660 --> 05:26.860]  And I don't know the rules around that.
[05:27.240 --> 05:29.540]  How do you vacuum seal a cup?
[05:29.900 --> 05:32.580]  I don't think it's been vacuum sealed at all.
[05:33.100 --> 05:35.760]  I think it's just that somebody just pressed a lid on.
[05:36.200 --> 05:38.700]  Yeah, like if it's in a pouch that's vacuum sealed.
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.220]  How's it in a cup though?
[05:40.740 --> 05:41.900]  Is there a straw in it?
[05:42.300 --> 05:44.220]  No, you have to pierce the top.
[05:44.300 --> 05:45.480]  It's a sealed...
[05:45.480 --> 05:46.500]  So the top, okay.
[05:47.080 --> 05:48.520]  Yeah, I mean, it sounds like...
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.340]  I mean, the way you're describing it and everything, Andrew,
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.520]  I think it's good to go, man.
[05:51.540 --> 05:53.020]  I think you can pop that thing open.
[05:53.260 --> 05:54.320]  Here, I'll take a photo.
[05:54.440 --> 05:55.300]  Eric's trying to kill you.
[05:55.660 --> 05:56.780]  Is there deer in it?
[05:57.260 --> 05:58.480]  Have a drink real quick, dude.
[05:58.660 --> 05:59.360]  Yeah, there's no deer.
[05:59.380 --> 05:59.840]  There's no way.
[05:59.900 --> 06:01.540]  And even if there was, it's fine, dude.
[06:01.560 --> 06:02.400]  It sounds like it's sealed.
[06:02.820 --> 06:03.240]  It is.
[06:03.400 --> 06:04.600]  It couldn't be more sealed.
[06:05.340 --> 06:06.080]  Take the photo.
[06:06.080 --> 06:07.140]  Uh-huh.
[06:07.600 --> 06:09.120]  Are we doing Umidigi or are we doing...
[06:09.120 --> 06:10.500]  Yeah, I was going to say, is this the Umidigi bison?
[06:10.740 --> 06:12.180]  No, no, I'm on the...
[06:12.780 --> 06:13.200]  Soy milk.
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.120]  Soy teriyaki phone or whatever, the soy phone.
[06:17.440 --> 06:17.660]  What?
[06:18.740 --> 06:20.420]  The soy sauce phone, whatever...
[06:20.420 --> 06:21.380]  Yeah, he's got the soy phone.
[06:22.180 --> 06:23.200]  Whatever the sauce...
[06:23.200 --> 06:24.920]  I don't remember what the sauce was that said...
[06:24.920 --> 06:25.580]  Soy oil.
[06:25.840 --> 06:27.440]  His phone is made with soy oil.
[06:28.040 --> 06:29.980]  Yeah, I'm on the soy phone.
[06:30.240 --> 06:30.920]  Soy oil phone.
[06:31.420 --> 06:33.100]  Here's the photo of the drink.
[06:34.300 --> 06:37.960]  This has been in my fridge for four or five months at this point.
[06:38.000 --> 06:38.400]  Oh, it's good.
[06:38.520 --> 06:39.600]  Oh, yeah, that's sealed.
[06:40.260 --> 06:40.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:40.820 --> 06:42.200]  It's super sealed.
[06:42.580 --> 06:44.660]  That's not vacuum sealed, that's just like heat sealed.
[06:44.740 --> 06:46.520]  That's like they've melted the lid on.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.120]  There's air in there.
[06:48.520 --> 06:50.640]  It's way more sealed than I thought it was.
[06:51.600 --> 06:52.680]  There's an air gap.
[06:54.060 --> 06:55.480]  I don't think there is.
[06:55.560 --> 06:56.580]  Where would the air gap be?
[06:57.680 --> 06:58.560]  Where there's...
[06:59.500 --> 07:00.640]  Right above the liquid.
[07:01.020 --> 07:01.560]  That's air.
[07:02.000 --> 07:02.500]  That is air.
[07:02.500 --> 07:03.860]  I see what you're saying.
[07:04.060 --> 07:04.120]  OK.
[07:04.300 --> 07:07.980]  If it was vacuum sealed, the liquid would be the only thing in there.
[07:08.220 --> 07:08.780]  Got it.
[07:08.940 --> 07:09.340]  Understood.
[07:09.660 --> 07:09.980]  Thank you.
[07:10.040 --> 07:10.780]  That cleared up a lot.
[07:12.460 --> 07:16.240]  Now, Andrew, does this have boba balls in it?
[07:16.820 --> 07:18.220]  No, no balls.
[07:19.080 --> 07:20.180]  No boba in it.
[07:20.340 --> 07:23.840]  It is, imagine as I said, a slushie is where we start.
[07:23.860 --> 07:25.180]  So here's the deal.
[07:25.260 --> 07:29.740]  If you rip the top off and you see mold or mildew on the top, then you have your answer.
[07:29.740 --> 07:33.180]  If it looks fine, I'm going to guess it's fine.
[07:33.720 --> 07:35.880]  That's where I'm kind of at.
[07:35.940 --> 07:36.860]  I don't know about that.
[07:37.140 --> 07:37.780]  Because it's like...
[07:38.260 --> 07:40.160]  With milk, you do the whiff test, right?
[07:40.180 --> 07:42.100]  You give it a little huff and you can just tell.
[07:42.280 --> 07:46.140]  I don't know if that would smell bad, but it could still have a little bacteria in it.
[07:47.240 --> 07:47.640]  Can...
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.260]  Can we try at the end of this episode to see if, like, if you...
[07:52.260 --> 07:53.660]  I want you to think about it.
[07:53.740 --> 07:57.060]  But if you, like, you keep looking at it, you go, you know what?
[07:57.100 --> 07:58.580]  Now is the time at the end of this episode.
[07:58.580 --> 08:00.380]  You want to, like, give it a drink?
[08:00.640 --> 08:01.460]  If it's something that you want.
[08:01.460 --> 08:02.240]  I don't...
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.000]  I don't know.
[08:03.720 --> 08:04.540]  I don't know.
[08:05.620 --> 08:08.520]  Here, I'm going to post a photo of what it looks like when I got it.
[08:09.240 --> 08:10.480]  Give it a contrast.
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.320]  It's almost like you intended for this experiment.
[08:12.400 --> 08:13.180]  Yeah, no, no.
[08:13.260 --> 08:14.880]  I take up a full picture of all your food.
[08:14.880 --> 08:16.020]  No, I just googled.
[08:16.100 --> 08:18.100]  I just googled where I got it from.
[08:18.280 --> 08:20.180]  Oh, it looks nothing like that anymore.
[08:21.220 --> 08:22.160]  Well, it's...
[08:23.040 --> 08:26.580]  Like, if you just melt that, I think it would look the exact same.
[08:27.140 --> 08:29.200]  Shouldn't a slushie be kept in the freezer?
[08:29.680 --> 08:30.960]  Or does that make it too cold?
[08:31.880 --> 08:32.460]  What do you mean?
[08:32.540 --> 08:34.200]  No, it would solidify.
[08:34.840 --> 08:36.840]  I think it needs to be kept in between.
[08:37.340 --> 08:39.760]  Yeah, in like a regulator box.
[08:40.160 --> 08:42.440]  You need a slusher, it needs to be a regulator box.
[08:43.400 --> 08:44.420]  It needs to be cold.
[08:44.500 --> 08:46.360]  It needs to be frozen, but stirred constantly.
[08:47.940 --> 08:48.820]  Yes, exactly.
[08:49.980 --> 08:55.900]  I don't think a strawberry as an ingredient would last months.
[08:55.900 --> 08:56.780]  I agree.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.780]  But I don't know if it's real strawberry.
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.640]  And if that's fresh, real strawberry, I think you have to walk away.
[09:04.500 --> 09:07.540]  If it's just flavoring, it might be okay.
[09:07.840 --> 09:09.420]  It's probably just really stale.
[09:09.660 --> 09:14.400]  Why don't you just rip that bad boy open and just take a deep whiff and see what you feel?
[09:14.980 --> 09:17.880]  You're the one that said that the whiff test would not work.
[09:18.520 --> 09:19.340]  It might work.
[09:19.440 --> 09:19.860]  It might work.
[09:19.920 --> 09:20.180]  I don't know.
[09:20.740 --> 09:22.000]  Eric's trying to kill you for sure, though.
[09:22.040 --> 09:23.260]  I wouldn't drink it.
[09:23.260 --> 09:23.620]  What do you mean?
[09:23.620 --> 09:25.920]  He's just asking if he can have a drink.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.820]  And I'm saying, baby, that looks pretty good.
[09:27.960 --> 09:30.340]  Why do you want some of our company to die?
[09:30.920 --> 09:32.640]  No, no, not die.
[09:32.760 --> 09:34.560]  I just want him to have his nice drink.
[09:36.320 --> 09:40.220]  They don't have any ingredient list on their website as well.
[09:40.540 --> 09:41.920]  Well, strawberries.
[09:42.020 --> 09:42.480]  Not great.
[09:43.380 --> 09:43.820]  Water.
[09:44.940 --> 09:45.920]  It's frozen secrets.
[09:46.720 --> 09:49.280]  This, I guess, isn't on the menu anymore.
[09:49.620 --> 09:51.240]  So I'm looking at other slushes.
[09:51.420 --> 09:51.500]  What?
[09:51.680 --> 09:52.720]  So now it's valuable.
[09:53.180 --> 09:54.900]  Oh, wow.
[09:55.000 --> 09:55.800]  You can hang on to it.
[09:55.840 --> 09:57.240]  There might be people, collectors out there.
[09:57.600 --> 09:58.960]  It's factory sealed.
[09:59.340 --> 10:00.960]  Yeah, this is a...
[10:00.960 --> 10:02.620]  Factory sealed was what I was looking for.
[10:02.860 --> 10:03.760]  Not vacuum.
[10:04.080 --> 10:04.640]  Thank you.
[10:05.000 --> 10:05.980]  Yeah, it's factory sealed.
[10:06.680 --> 10:09.440]  Yeah, this could be a PSA 10 boba time.
[10:09.980 --> 10:10.140]  Yeah.
[10:10.600 --> 10:12.740]  I mean, it's definitely not from a factory, but it is sealed.
[10:12.860 --> 10:13.000]  Yeah.
[10:13.760 --> 10:18.500]  It says on the honeydew slush, an icy blend of bold, fruity honeydew flavor,
[10:18.500 --> 10:23.340]  which makes me think there's no actual organic fruit.
[10:23.480 --> 10:24.060]  You're right, dude.
[10:24.120 --> 10:24.720]  Then you're good.
[10:24.980 --> 10:25.800]  Like, that's...
[10:25.800 --> 10:26.300]  Yeah.
[10:26.540 --> 10:29.240]  But I don't trust it because then I go to...
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.500]  Oh, no, because then I go to passion fruit slush and it says a frosty combination of
[10:34.500 --> 10:35.280]  sweet and tart flavors.
[10:35.620 --> 10:38.820]  The perfect imbalance slush dotted with real passion fruit seeds.
[10:39.780 --> 10:40.620]  That's real.
[10:41.440 --> 10:43.080]  That's the opposite of flavor.
[10:43.720 --> 10:44.500]  Although seeds...
[10:45.460 --> 10:46.460]  They would...
[10:46.460 --> 10:47.660]  Seeds last forever.
[10:47.660 --> 10:49.120]  Yeah, seeds keep, dude.
[10:49.320 --> 10:52.300]  I would have a passion fruit tree if that was what was in my...
[10:52.300 --> 10:53.920]  The seeds would have grown by now.
[10:54.140 --> 10:57.720]  I mean, you could take a passion fruit seed and freeze it for a hundred thousand years
[10:57.720 --> 10:59.620]  and thaw it out and plant it and it'd be fine.
[11:01.860 --> 11:02.260]  Um...
[11:02.260 --> 11:06.200]  I gotta think three months in a fridge wouldn't do any damage to a seed.
[11:07.960 --> 11:09.140]  I guess I'll open it.
[11:10.160 --> 11:11.360]  I guess I'll open it.
[11:11.620 --> 11:13.000]  I'm really nervous about this.
[11:14.140 --> 11:14.780]  I'm not.
[11:15.360 --> 11:16.560]  Dude, I'm so glad you're doing this.
[11:16.560 --> 11:17.580]  I had fucking nothing.
[11:19.200 --> 11:20.440]  This isn't even in my notes.
[11:20.860 --> 11:22.760]  You have nothing after such a break?
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.280]  Oh, wait, we didn't have a break, did we?
[11:24.460 --> 11:27.880]  We didn't have a break and nothing in our lives happened.
[11:28.120 --> 11:29.000]  It was a very uneventful...
[11:29.000 --> 11:29.640]  I got shit.
[11:29.700 --> 11:30.220]  I struggled.
[11:30.360 --> 11:30.860]  I stretched.
[11:31.040 --> 11:32.220]  But, you know, this is way better.
[11:32.560 --> 11:33.920]  I had a lot of stuff land in my lap.
[11:34.000 --> 11:34.540]  That's all I'm saying.
[11:35.340 --> 11:37.660]  Dude, I saw some stuff land in your yard the other day.
[11:38.000 --> 11:38.900]  I'm in house hell.
[11:39.080 --> 11:39.580]  We'll get to it.
[11:41.440 --> 11:42.240]  What's happening, Andrew?
[11:44.340 --> 11:45.460]  I don't trust it.
[11:46.100 --> 11:47.140]  I don't trust this.
[11:47.260 --> 11:47.960]  Did you open it?
[11:48.400 --> 11:50.800]  Yeah, I'm peeling it now so I could get a better view.
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.220]  Get the old nostrils in there.
[11:54.180 --> 11:57.220]  I... did a little black cloud like a soul escape.
[11:57.860 --> 11:59.000]  Not that I noticed.
[11:59.120 --> 12:00.120]  It is a little dark in here.
[12:00.760 --> 12:01.140]  Let me see.
[12:03.280 --> 12:04.680]  Did you hear any noises?
[12:04.880 --> 12:05.540]  Demonic noises?
[12:05.660 --> 12:07.120]  High-pitched squeals or anything?
[12:07.560 --> 12:09.240]  It just... it smells like syrup.
[12:11.120 --> 12:12.700]  I don't see anything.
[12:13.480 --> 12:14.800]  Maybe... let me...
[12:14.800 --> 12:17.720]  Shit, the lid just went fucking... god damn it.
[12:18.880 --> 12:20.540]  Fucking piece of shit.
[12:22.720 --> 12:24.080]  Lid... it's a fucking thing.
[12:24.880 --> 12:27.800]  I love how he makes the simplest thing on earth hard.
[12:29.140 --> 12:32.700]  I... I have a huge problem with it just... with it standing liquid.
[12:32.940 --> 12:33.800]  I... I hate it.
[12:34.080 --> 12:36.240]  You know like when you leave a bottle of water and then it all gets...
[12:36.800 --> 12:38.860]  all drippy and condensate-y on the inside?
[12:39.040 --> 12:39.660]  It's repulsive.
[12:40.100 --> 12:44.540]  I left a half a glass of Pepsi out last night and when I saw it this morning,
[12:44.540 --> 12:46.280]  I got so fucking mad at myself.
[12:46.500 --> 12:48.660]  Because I was like, well I can't drink that, it's gross now.
[12:48.820 --> 12:52.800]  And I just wasted a half a glass of Pepsi and I'm gonna want that Pepsi later on today.
[12:53.040 --> 12:53.960]  Like right now for instance.
[12:54.120 --> 12:56.940]  And I won't have it because I had to pour it down the fucking drain like an idiot.
[12:57.280 --> 12:58.320]  Was it the last of your Pepsi?
[12:59.040 --> 12:59.440]  Yes.
[13:02.800 --> 13:03.200]  Interesting.
[13:03.960 --> 13:04.220]  Yeah.
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.220]  I can smell strawberry in the air now that I fully removed the lid.
[13:09.140 --> 13:10.220]  That's a good sign.
[13:10.380 --> 13:13.800]  There's a sweetness in the air that wasn't... that's definitely strawberry.
[13:14.280 --> 13:15.500]  I think that's all it's good for.
[13:15.580 --> 13:18.140]  It's an air freshener, but I'd call it there.
[13:18.220 --> 13:23.640]  Also like, in terms of drinking it or not, if there's harmful mold in it,
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.640]  you just release those spores into the air and you're now breathing them into your body and
[13:28.640 --> 13:30.320]  your lungs so you're gonna get it either way.
[13:30.400 --> 13:31.760]  This is how The Last of Us started.
[13:32.160 --> 13:33.360]  I got the spores in me now.
[13:33.380 --> 13:36.080]  Looking at this picture, you've just taken a new picture of the top.
[13:36.140 --> 13:37.640]  Are you sure this isn't on the Umidigi?
[13:37.760 --> 13:38.980]  That looks like a can of paint.
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.940]  That looks like a top down of a can of red paint.
[13:41.940 --> 13:43.620]  There's a bunch of...
[13:45.600 --> 13:46.800]  I don't know.
[13:47.900 --> 13:49.620]  Dust is what I would...
[13:49.620 --> 13:51.940]  Come on, get rid of this shit.
[13:52.820 --> 13:55.580]  I think one drink isn't gonna hurt you.
[13:55.660 --> 13:57.300]  It's just one little sip.
[13:57.740 --> 14:02.500]  I love it when you gag and choke and throw up more than anyone, but I think you'll die.
[14:03.260 --> 14:07.020]  I love that none of you motherfuckers managed to hold on to an apple for more than two weeks,
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.080]  but he can hold a fucking boba tea for six months.
[14:12.460 --> 14:13.260]  You know what?
[14:13.600 --> 14:16.100]  I think I got an apple actually in my fridge right now.
[14:16.360 --> 14:17.100]  I do.
[14:17.700 --> 14:18.260]  I got...
[14:18.260 --> 14:20.160]  The apple might be like six months.
[14:20.300 --> 14:21.300]  Do you want me to pull the apple out?
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.360]  Yeah.
[14:22.420 --> 14:23.540]  That's a f***ing face apple.
[14:23.800 --> 14:24.620]  Yeah, because it's...
[14:24.620 --> 14:26.180]  That's a fucking piece of history right there.
[14:26.200 --> 14:26.740]  I'll just put it back in.
[14:26.740 --> 14:27.020]  Okay.
[14:27.320 --> 14:27.820]  It's not done yet.
[14:27.820 --> 14:28.680]  We're going deep in the fridge.
[14:29.080 --> 14:30.040]  The boba...
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.360]  The slush has been blocking the apple, which also needs to be removed.
[14:34.520 --> 14:35.140]  And I just...
[14:35.140 --> 14:36.180]  I've been ignoring it.
[14:36.240 --> 14:36.640]  Let me see.
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.560]  I think the apple's not holding well.
[14:38.860 --> 14:41.400]  So this episode is just you cleaning out your fridge?
[14:42.000 --> 14:42.440]  Hahaha!
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.180]  That sounds like such a great supplemental.
[14:48.880 --> 14:50.280]  Andrew just enlisting off.
[14:50.540 --> 14:53.060]  He's just stood at his fridge with a black trash bag.
[14:53.840 --> 14:55.300]  It looks like...
[14:55.300 --> 14:57.100]  Is Andrew playing Assassin's Creed?
[14:57.320 --> 14:57.880]  What is that?
[14:58.160 --> 14:58.600]  Valhalla?
[14:59.660 --> 15:00.620]  Oh, there's a Ubisoft.
[15:00.760 --> 15:03.080]  I was just seeing what was going on with the Ubisoft sale.
[15:04.280 --> 15:07.860]  Do you have a laptop on top of your desk?
[15:08.660 --> 15:08.820]  Yeah.
[15:09.060 --> 15:09.480]  Above...
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.340]  Is it on a stand?
[15:10.460 --> 15:11.140]  What's under it?
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.780]  We've talked about this. It's the norm shell is underneath it.
[15:17.260 --> 15:17.820]  Right.
[15:18.580 --> 15:22.840]  What on earth is all the schmutz all over your...
[15:24.660 --> 15:26.120]  How do your keys work?
[15:27.180 --> 15:33.160]  That's a... that's a wrinkled apple. That's a messed up apple. I'm more distracted by just the gumpf.
[15:34.920 --> 15:39.680]  Oh, the bottom keyboard? The bottom gumpf? All of it. There's gumpf everywhere.
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.140]  Unfortunately, the picture quality is too high.
[15:43.380 --> 15:47.400]  Yeah, I don't understand. I thought this was just dusted.
[15:47.800 --> 15:51.960]  Well, yeah, like a week ago. That's that's your mom's cleaning job?
[15:52.320 --> 15:59.360]  I'd call it back in. No, no, that's not his mom's cleaning job. Wait, for the keyboard thing? Is that what you mean?
[16:00.160 --> 16:04.640]  Oh, listen, I've had food since then, okay? And the problem is,
[16:04.820 --> 16:09.440]  is I need to have the food on the laptop, which is above that.
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.280]  So it's the remnant's fault. He needs to have food on the laptop.
[16:16.540 --> 16:16.980]  Because...
[16:19.840 --> 16:26.400]  You don't need to put food anywhere near that. No, because... What, do you want him to put it on the toilet next to him in the bathtub?
[16:26.620 --> 16:32.640]  We already eliminated that. We told him he can't do that anymore. We told him he can't make hot dogs in his closet anymore.
[16:32.900 --> 16:34.680]  Where's this poor boy gonna eat?
[16:36.820 --> 16:58.300]  Now, we have established that I don't have a table, so I typically will eat at my desk, but the big keyboard for the Mac I have, I can't put a plate on it, and I have no surface area to my left, so I use the top of my laptop as like a flat surface.
[16:59.200 --> 17:04.660]  A, you're an animal. B, what about all the shit that's behind it, like security or whatever that says?
[17:04.660 --> 17:08.960]  Why don't you move some of that and just slide everything back a bit? There's not enough room here.
[17:09.020 --> 17:15.900]  Let me take a photo of the security. I need like a, I need a wide. I think all that stuff is, is, that seems like a load-bearing DVD.
[17:16.640 --> 17:22.820]  Hmm. Those were Denzel Washington movies that you cannot get online. Like John Q?
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.260]  It is for Queen and Country, I think. Okay.
[17:27.440 --> 17:32.040]  Yeah, and Ricochet, or the, or the...
[17:32.920 --> 17:33.360]  Ricochet.
[17:34.480 --> 17:41.580]  Um. I remember that that was a movie. John Lithgow's in it. I'm excited to see it. Very highly recommended by TPG.
[17:43.160 --> 17:52.480]  Lithgow. There you go. So this is the side of the desk situation. This, this feels like old f*** face to me. I love this.
[17:52.900 --> 17:56.820]  Gavin has f***ing a lot of opinions here. Okay. There's no, where am I putting a plate?
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.540]  There's no plate room there. Oh, is that the, is that the GoXLR?
[18:02.040 --> 18:06.640]  That is the GoXLR. Yeah. Is it running and working and everything? Oh, it's, it's, it's humming.
[18:07.020 --> 18:10.460]  Look how new that thing is, and look how old it looks.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.360]  It's humming. It's because he's put it to use. This is awesome. It's because he put it to work. Nick, can I ask you a question?
[18:18.760 --> 18:24.080]  Yeah, go for it. Just out of personal curiosity. Sure. Uh, have you noticed an increase in audio
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.280]  quality since he got that? Because Gavin was having so much trouble with his audio blowing
[18:27.280 --> 18:35.940]  out in gameplay videos. I haven't noticed a difference so far. It's not bad, but just the same.
[18:36.340 --> 18:40.520]  Just the same. Maybe I'm not doing something right. Maybe I'll go through with Gavin. Maybe Gavin's just super picky.
[18:41.080 --> 18:45.660]  I'm pretty audio picky. I think you're audio picky. Yeah. And that's okay. Well, after you listen to
[18:45.660 --> 18:51.780]  that Gears of War video, it gives me a headache. What video? The Gears of War one I edited.
[18:51.780 --> 18:59.040]  Oh, no, I didn't. I didn't, but I saw a lot of comments about it. So I believe you're right.
[18:59.320 --> 19:04.280]  Yeah. What were the comments? I didn't see them. It was just mainly about my audio being terrible.
[19:04.760 --> 19:09.820]  Oh, okay. This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's
[19:09.820 --> 19:15.000]  the classic blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.380]  brown sugar cold foam. Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[19:21.180 --> 19:28.320]  Hey, it's Paris. You know I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and
[19:28.320 --> 19:34.960]  AutoCamp, I just slept under them. Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious
[19:34.960 --> 19:42.140]  Airstream, making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors
[19:42.140 --> 19:49.120]  meets Hilton hospitality. That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton
[19:49.120 --> 19:56.640]  for the stay. Speaking of comments, not to get away from Andrew's desk or the creative assortment
[19:56.640 --> 20:03.200]  of items. Just real quick, I gotta say, when we all talked about seeing Twisters the other day and
[20:03.200 --> 20:08.600]  none of us liked it, I thought, I assumed we were going to catch some heat because I had a feeling
[20:08.600 --> 20:13.020]  it was going to be a pretty popular movie and you know, What's-His-Face is real popular right now and
[20:13.020 --> 20:20.380]  Uh, I was really surprised and heartened by the fact that pretty much the entire audience at a
[20:20.380 --> 20:25.880]  whole agreed with us and backed us up and nobody liked that movie. Why? Take that, Barbara Badour.
[20:26.300 --> 20:31.720]  Anyway, is that what happened? Yeah, anyway, Andrew, you were you were talking about your
[20:31.720 --> 20:39.400]  dust. Oh no, listen, dust exists. No, it's the opposite of what happened. And a huge minority.
[20:39.880 --> 20:46.420]  I think the people just sense the jealousy coming from you three that it is the box office smash.
[20:46.660 --> 20:51.560]  Well, I guess not the smash because it's Deadpool Wolverine. He oversold it immediately. The box
[20:51.560 --> 20:57.560]  office smash. Well, actually, in a traditional summer, it would be the smash, but it just got
[20:57.560 --> 21:04.780]  double smashed it much like Twisters. A second one came in. That's Deadpool Wolverine. I loved
[21:04.780 --> 21:10.820]  all the armchair analysis of how we're film snobs or we're film hipsters, or we grew up in a
[21:10.820 --> 21:16.060]  time when we evaluated films differently and we can't just understand and appreciate it for what
[21:16.060 --> 21:21.060]  it is. No, it just wasn't a very good movie. Well, I was just comparing it to the first one as a
[21:21.060 --> 21:25.080]  standalone. I might feel differently, but the first one's a great movie. I think everything that the
[21:25.080 --> 21:29.180]  people said was correct and that they should continue to see Twisters because it's a great
[21:29.180 --> 21:33.980]  movie. I'm tired of the excuse of, oh, yeah, it wasn't very good. It was a summer blockbuster
[21:33.980 --> 21:38.640]  when there are so many out there that are good and everyone else is playing with the bad ones,
[21:38.660 --> 21:43.640]  I guess. Deadpool Wolverine, big summer blockbuster, big summer blockbuster. I haven't
[21:43.640 --> 21:48.740]  seen that movie, but everybody that has fucking speaks very glowingly about it. I just I think
[21:48.740 --> 21:53.460]  I appreciate it more because it's been so long since I've been in a rammed movie theater with
[21:53.460 --> 21:59.720]  everyone laughing so much. It was just like, oh, I remember this. You watched it? You liked it?
[21:59.720 --> 22:05.220]  Deadpool Wolverine? I liked it. Yeah. I mean, not the deepest story, but it was very entertaining,
[22:05.300 --> 22:10.300]  I thought. You should see it again. See if that opinion changes. I was thinking about seeing it
[22:10.300 --> 22:15.000]  with Millie before she goes off to college if she wants to. Oh, you should. Yeah. I agree.
[22:16.460 --> 22:23.180]  I saw a comment that I thought was so funny of, imagine if I beat Gavin in the movie league by
[22:23.180 --> 22:27.100]  three million and the difference is the Kevin Costner, Westerner.
[22:30.200 --> 22:35.720]  If Horizon part two, if that's the difference, it'd be amazing. I'm somehow hoping that it's
[22:35.720 --> 22:39.200]  so tight that my 15 remaining bucks is what takes me through the finish line.
[22:39.520 --> 22:46.080]  It is going to come down to Alien. If Alien does worse, I projected in my head of being
[22:46.080 --> 22:50.620]  less popular than Covenant, but that might not be the case. And if it's not,
[22:50.620 --> 22:57.920]  that's a problem for me. Hell yeah. Well, I'm just amazed at how well those two movies did.
[22:58.580 --> 23:04.220]  Deadpool, like breaking box office records. And then what was the Inside Out 2? Holy shit,
[23:04.300 --> 23:10.100]  that's wild. That's such a fun thing. Oh, and Bad Boys too. Yeah. It's been such a fun thing to
[23:10.100 --> 23:14.800]  watch. And I really hope we do it every year because it just makes me appreciate summer
[23:14.800 --> 23:20.160]  film releases in a way that I used to ignore them, you know? I agree. I've been way more invested.
[23:21.060 --> 23:26.240]  It made me realize how disconnected I was from these summer releases, where I was like,
[23:26.300 --> 23:31.220]  Inside Out 2, like, who wants that? Nobody wants that. And it's like, by far, everybody.
[23:31.640 --> 23:36.600]  Apparently, everybody wanted it. What if next time we do this, we take our winnings
[23:36.600 --> 23:43.360]  as currency for the next pick? What do you mean? So that somehow I'm a major advantage and I have
[23:43.360 --> 23:48.980]  more points to spend because I did better last year. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, you're describing
[23:48.980 --> 23:54.420]  the opposite of how every game works, like every sport. Yeah. You're like, what if the team that
[23:54.420 --> 24:00.000]  wins the championship gets the first pick in the draft next year? I mean, that works in sports,
[24:00.020 --> 24:06.100]  but when it comes to money, I feel like it's the opposite. I think I like your idea a lot.
[24:07.200 --> 24:14.080]  What do you mean, how? What do you mean, what do I mean, how? Like, if my studio made the most
[24:14.080 --> 24:20.560]  profit, surely I'm going to be buying up more movies. Yeah. And so where does the fun game begin?
[24:20.740 --> 24:26.280]  Yeah, so what is that? What? So what? What? It sounds to me like it's just every every summer
[24:26.280 --> 24:30.800]  we tune in to watch Gavin make more money and take a bigger piece of the pie from us.
[24:30.940 --> 24:33.960]  Isn't that how these monopolies work? What are you talking about? Yeah, I was going to say,
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.280]  Gavin doesn't want to play Monopoly. He wants to be Monopoly. He wants to be the Monopoly. Gavin
[24:38.280 --> 24:42.200]  doesn't want to play Monopoly. He wants to live in the real world, apparently. I don't want to start
[24:42.200 --> 24:51.680]  with 98 points. I want like 120 points. Yeah, I want Nick to start with like 16. No, I think life is the problem
[24:51.680 --> 24:57.560]  because I like your idea a lot. If like it didn't take one year essentially to do one of these
[24:57.560 --> 25:03.700]  because the premise of you absolutely fussing about with your movies and fucking up and going
[25:03.700 --> 25:10.460]  bankrupt is really funny to me. Absolutely. Yeah, we should figure this out in a shorter format.
[25:10.460 --> 25:16.120]  That's such a good idea. But that is like, yeah, because of like this format for this,
[25:16.200 --> 25:21.460]  that is eight years of life. And it's just too much for that joke. I like high stakes gaming.
[25:22.740 --> 25:27.620]  Listen, I'm with you. I'm all the way. And that's why people should see Deadpool and Wolverine and
[25:27.620 --> 25:33.400]  Twisters and Fly Me to the Moon if it's still in your area. People should see whatever movie they
[25:33.400 --> 25:39.000]  want to see and they should feel free to enjoy whatever movie they want to enjoy, whether the
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.720]  regulation crew likes it or not. And we don't, just so you know. I need to pivot to movies,
[25:45.780 --> 25:52.000]  talking about Twisters, one of America's great blockbusters of the year. Last episode,
[25:52.760 --> 25:59.460]  I brought up the Paul Scheer thing, and it was not felt. You guys didn't know this at the time.
[26:00.060 --> 26:05.900]  I have never been more embarrassed in the history of fuckface than after I made that statement.
[26:05.900 --> 26:10.580]  How about in the history of regulation? Or regulation? Yeah, that's true. There's fewer
[26:10.580 --> 26:15.220]  episodes of that. About him being a fetus in the first? Yeah, about him being a fetus in the first.
[26:15.360 --> 26:20.100]  I have never been more embarrassed in the history of this show. That was more embarrassing than
[26:20.100 --> 26:26.140]  the Swiss army knife being made in Germany? Way more embarrassing because I got got. That was me
[26:26.140 --> 26:32.620]  just not, that was me getting myself. I got got and I knew what happened and I couldn't vocalize
[26:32.620 --> 26:39.340]  it at the time, but it was it was like in a con movie when the guy steals all your money and
[26:39.340 --> 26:46.420]  escapes and then they go, oh no, like they realize what happened. That was me internally. Every time
[26:46.420 --> 26:50.940]  you guys made a joke about that, it killed me at that time. It's the most embarrassed I've been
[26:50.940 --> 26:58.580]  because I realized, oh, he got me. He got me so good. He was absolutely because it was the TikTok
[26:58.580 --> 27:06.140]  I saw of it was him at a red carpet, so it didn't feel like his content. And it included a clip of
[27:06.140 --> 27:11.600]  a pregnant woman in the background of it. It all felt so real. But upon like any analysis of like
[27:11.600 --> 27:16.100]  actual, it's one of those things they just swipe through. And I went at Twister's probably came out
[27:16.100 --> 27:20.560]  in like the 80s. That feels right to me or Twister. And then when you guys brought up that it was a
[27:20.560 --> 27:27.380]  90s movie, I was like, oh, this son of a bit like I am. He designed that as the joke. And I stepped in
[27:27.380 --> 27:36.840]  that just massively. You brimleyed it. I brimleyed it so bad. And it made it so much worse knowing
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.320]  that that was it was a trap. It was someone he put down a brimley trap and I stepped right in.
[27:41.780 --> 27:52.720]  What a what a very specific niche verb, even for us. Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah. I share your pain, dude.
[27:52.720 --> 27:58.020]  I've been there. Oh, yeah, I know. I thought of as like, oh, fuck, Jeff. Jeff knows what this is
[27:58.020 --> 28:05.780]  like, but I had to make that phone call after the episode. Oh, dumb I am. It sucks. It's not even
[28:05.780 --> 28:10.280]  just being dumb. It's someone getting you. He got me. Yeah. Yeah. And it was one of those things
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.340]  where I assumed it was a viral TikTok. It came up in my feed again later that day and it had like
[28:16.340 --> 28:23.500]  seven thousand likes. Like it was very small. It was a small it didn't it wasn't wide.
[28:23.780 --> 28:27.160]  I actually paid attention to it this time and I was like, oh, this is just his account.
[28:28.880 --> 28:35.560]  Oh, oh, it hurt. It hurt. That is really funny. But what doesn't hurt is going to see Twisters,
[28:35.760 --> 28:44.280]  the American blockbuster. Go see Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. It doesn't matter. It's not going
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.400]  to make a bit of fucking difference, but see it anyway. The only movie I don't want people to see
[28:48.400 --> 28:54.100]  is Aliens Covenant or Romulus, whatever Romulus is called. Teen aliens. Teen aliens. Yeah. Don't
[28:54.100 --> 29:00.840]  see that. I hear that's no good. I think it looks decent. I hear. Oh, Gavin, I hear that Horizon,
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.580]  whatever the fuck it's called, Dawn Part Two is going to show at Cannes Film Festival,
[29:08.760 --> 29:12.260]  which is not in the U.S., but maybe that'll drum up some excitement. And then we got
[29:12.260 --> 29:20.540]  to go. No, I think you should go. Yeah, I've been before. I'll probably stay back. You've been to
[29:20.540 --> 29:29.220]  Cannes? Yeah. Well, for what? Broadcast, you know, YouTube thing. Oh, they did a YouTube thing at
[29:29.220 --> 29:36.920]  Cannes? Yeah. I don't. That sounds. I don't. Does that surprise you? Jamie Oliver was there for
[29:36.920 --> 29:42.240]  some reason. Are you saying it both ways so you don't get got right now, Andrew? I'm trying to
[29:42.240 --> 29:47.140]  evaluate, is what I'm trying to do, because he said that in a way that was like, I just made
[29:47.140 --> 29:51.460]  that up. But he also just sounds like that sometimes. No, he's definitely been to Cannes.
[29:51.580 --> 29:57.480]  I remember when he went. He's not lying about that. OK, it'd be weird got. But you know what?
[29:57.540 --> 30:02.940]  I'm I'm in my paranoid era right now is where I'm at. You owe me 15 bucks. I just covered for you.
[30:03.440 --> 30:07.720]  Thanks, man. Paranoid era. Yeah, no problem. Jamie Oliver was there. Is that what you said?
[30:08.280 --> 30:13.260]  Yeah. Do him. No, no. Why would he? He's not a YouTube guy.
[30:14.680 --> 30:20.540]  Is Jamie Oliver a YouTube guy? Yeah, he had a YouTube channel. A lot of people have YouTube
[30:20.540 --> 30:26.780]  channels. I have a YouTube channel. That doesn't mean anything. Are you referring to the John
[30:26.780 --> 30:33.840]  Caviar channel? I should have a John Caviar channel. No, I'm not. I don't have the range
[30:33.840 --> 30:40.680]  I was referring to the musician John Caviar. Yeah. No. Hopefully we sent some some some traffic his
[30:40.680 --> 30:46.280]  way. That just proves that you met Jamie Oliver. Also, Jamie Oliver looks like he wants to kill
[30:46.280 --> 30:53.640]  both of you. He's really nice. I was in a headlock. You guys look like you're about to make out.
[30:56.040 --> 31:01.140]  Look how jealous Dan is. Do do bulls ever come through the glory hole or is it usually just
[31:01.140 --> 31:06.980]  the shaft? I think it's just shaft, right? Hey, so are you on like a weirdo run or what's
[31:06.980 --> 31:11.500]  happening? Because last time it was the happy ending and this time it's this. I'm just trying
[31:11.500 --> 31:19.960]  to get clarity. I think it's just the shaft. Right. Yeah, I would think so, but I just don't know.
[31:20.120 --> 31:25.940]  I'm wondering whether there's ever like a larger hole below the glory hole where you can get a
[31:25.940 --> 31:33.580]  hand in and sort of nurse the balls a little bit. I'm trying. Like if I was designing a glory hole,
[31:33.680 --> 31:38.820]  I think that's what I would do. You would make a second hole for the balls, but then you'd have
[31:38.820 --> 31:44.260]  to like push the ball. No, I wouldn't be thumbing the balls through the hole. I'd be it'd be a hand
[31:44.260 --> 31:55.060]  hole. Oh, so you have like dick goes out, hand goes in. That makes way more sense. I like that.
[31:56.880 --> 32:03.180]  Yeah, I like that. You should do that. Yeah. Because otherwise imagining the glory hole
[32:03.180 --> 32:07.620]  situation, I just don't, I don't know if it'd be that enjoyable. Man. Could you imagine having a
[32:07.620 --> 32:12.220]  hold of some dude's wiener in one hand and his balls in the other? And there's a wall between
[32:12.220 --> 32:18.260]  you. He's really at your disposal at that, at that point. There's not much he can do. There's not
[32:18.260 --> 32:21.760]  much you can do to get out of that situation. You're kind of at the mercy of the other side of
[32:21.760 --> 32:27.060]  the glory hole there. I think if I was using a glory hole, I would feel more vulnerable if my
[32:27.060 --> 32:32.300]  balls were also through. Yeah. Cause if you pull back too far, you might just like pop them right
[32:32.300 --> 32:37.560]  off. They got to suck through the hole. Let me make sure that I'm understanding your visual
[32:37.560 --> 32:45.480]  correctly. Are you saying you want the equivalent of like one of these, but like hand holes for the
[32:45.480 --> 32:53.160]  other side? Has anyone made one of those? You were like, they shoved their head in.
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.880]  Like you want the head holes, but for hands.
[33:04.590 --> 33:12.370]  Oh, we've got to make one.
[33:17.920 --> 33:20.240]  Oh, that's horrific.
[33:20.900 --> 33:22.860]  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
[33:27.200 --> 33:31.360]  Is that what you meant for the hand holes? Like you wanted those holes on the side of the mini
[33:31.360 --> 33:36.900]  hole? Why would it be on the side? I thought you wanted them to be able to reach through.
[33:38.200 --> 33:43.540]  Do you need, should I put a diagram? I can start drawing. Yeah, please draw. Cause I originally
[33:43.540 --> 33:49.880]  imagined just a bigger hole that the balls would go through, but then you said you wanted hands.
[33:49.880 --> 33:55.220]  So I thought maybe there'd be two arm holes so the person could reach through
[33:56.200 --> 34:00.840]  on the, I don't know how to, I guess the suck inside. I don't know how to say,
[34:01.340 --> 34:10.540]  how do I differentiate? I think the suck inside. The what? The suck inside. Cause one side sucks,
[34:10.840 --> 34:17.660]  the other stands. What's a more elegant way to describe the suck inside? You got a suck side
[34:17.660 --> 34:33.460]  and a tickle side. The giver? I'm excited to see the diagram. I'm also really excited to see which
[34:33.460 --> 34:37.120]  regulation listener can't wait. They're falling all over themselves right now to get on the
[34:37.120 --> 34:43.000]  subreddit to write out their crazy story about how they put up their balls through a glory hole.
[34:43.000 --> 34:52.800]  Uh, this is fucking insane. I'm so excited. Do we know a stunt dick? Cause the joke only works,
[34:53.060 --> 34:56.880]  Geoff, that you're still recovering over. If there is a dick through the hole, I don't think
[34:56.880 --> 35:03.740]  any anybody here wants to put their dick through the Tom Cruise hole. I think we need a stunt dick.
[35:04.240 --> 35:09.040]  I would absolutely put my dick through a Tom Cruise hole so Emily can take a photo of it.
[35:09.040 --> 35:16.100]  Come on. How would you not? Ah, shit. I've messed it up again. I forgot that the canvas is so much
[35:16.100 --> 35:24.300]  bigger than the... Oh my God. It's so small. It's very small. I've messed it up again.
[35:27.260 --> 35:32.720]  That's what I imagined. So it's just a really big hole. It's just a large glory hole.
[35:32.980 --> 35:35.160]  It looks like you're sticking your hand in a light socket.
[35:36.960 --> 35:43.120]  That's really well done. I think you want the hole to be small. I think you want the least
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.760]  amount of you possible is the point, isn't it? What do you mean the least? The what?
[35:48.240 --> 35:54.160]  Isn't the whole point of the glory hole, the privacy, the unknown, like that's a huge hole.
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.360]  I feel like that's revealing too much of the person. Well, it needs to be large enough for
[35:58.360 --> 36:02.540]  a hand. Maybe it's too big in that diagram. I just want you to be able to see the hand.
[36:03.020 --> 36:09.060]  You're just giving us the broad strokes. Yeah. That's the uniform glory hole, I think.
[36:09.800 --> 36:16.360]  But that's what I'm saying. Maybe you have two other holes. Two hands. So you got the dick hole
[36:16.360 --> 36:21.700]  and then you got the two hands on the side. Why do you need both hands? Well, you just want one
[36:21.700 --> 36:25.560]  hand. That doesn't feel right. If you're doing a good job on the wiener, you got your... it
[36:25.560 --> 36:29.460]  looks like you got your right hand on the shaft and then your left hand down in the hand hole.
[36:29.460 --> 36:35.540]  So your hands are both probably used. I think you want two. Can you draw it out for me? Two
[36:35.540 --> 36:40.260]  hands on the balls? Are you like milking them? Like he's fucking out of letters? No, two holes.
[36:40.780 --> 36:45.880]  Two holes in the wall. Oh, yeah. One for righty, one for lefty. Well, just I think it would feel
[36:45.880 --> 36:56.600]  weird to only be able to have one hand go through the wall. I disagree. You think only one hand?
[36:57.280 --> 37:03.260]  Yeah. You probably want to use the other hand to like balance yourself. Maybe. You're getting a
[37:03.260 --> 37:06.620]  dick slammed in your mouth where you got a hand through a hole in the darkness. You're just
[37:06.620 --> 37:14.210]  grabbing on to who God knows what. Probably a little disorienting. That's a fair point. I guess
[37:14.210 --> 37:19.330]  I was just I wasn't really thinking in the context of... To be to be fair, it was it was bold of me
[37:19.330 --> 37:24.550]  to try and revamp something I have no experience with. So it's probably not a good idea. I like
[37:24.550 --> 37:31.010]  your idea. Yeah. But the more I think about glory holes in general, it just seems like a lot of.
[37:31.830 --> 37:34.950]  It doesn't seem like a comfortable experience on either side of the hole.
[37:36.430 --> 37:40.710]  Yeah. I don't think I would be into it. What's the name of those?
[37:42.890 --> 37:52.330]  Anyone here see the movie Life? The alien movie Life? Ryan Reynolds? No. Jake Gyllenhaal? No.
[37:52.330 --> 37:59.850]  One of those boxes that you have that they put the alien in a box and it's got hand holes in it.
[38:00.570 --> 38:03.510]  That's sort of what I'm envisioning, but I don't know what to call those boxes.
[38:04.310 --> 38:09.390]  What's the point of the holes in that for the alien? The point is to keep the alien contained
[38:09.390 --> 38:14.830]  in the hand holes or so the scientists can like interact with it. Do they put their dicks in the
[38:14.830 --> 38:23.130]  hand holes? I don't know. Dicks go through contained. I don't I don't even know it's
[38:24.530 --> 38:31.850]  contained element. No. Anyway, are you just talking about this? Yeah. Yes. What are those
[38:31.850 --> 38:42.410]  called? A glove box? A lab box. Yeah. I didn't know. OK. Glove box. Glove box. That's a glove
[38:42.410 --> 38:47.010]  box. I don't know why you're going. I don't. You heard it wrong. You said it wrong. And now
[38:47.010 --> 38:51.190]  you're going to argue with me that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not arguing. I said, like,
[38:51.210 --> 38:56.790]  from a lab at the same time. I just I got the wires crossed. And when I hear glove box,
[38:56.810 --> 39:02.570]  I think of a car. I don't think of that. To be fair, I said so would I. We used to use those
[39:02.570 --> 39:08.010]  to sandblast stuff when I worked at the tool shop. Right. Yeah. It's just a box that has gloves.
[39:09.670 --> 39:12.790]  That's a glove box. That's what I was picturing with what you were saying, Gavin,
[39:12.870 --> 39:19.150]  of the arm holes through the sides. And have a glove on? I mean, you probably want a glove.
[39:19.210 --> 39:22.310]  Well, maybe you don't know. No, that glove is interesting.
[39:24.230 --> 39:29.510]  There are a lot of questions that I don't I don't want to. I think that me going down
[39:30.390 --> 39:37.210]  and through this hole any further would be a mistake. There are a lot more places we could go
[39:37.210 --> 39:41.530]  based on what you said, but I think we just move on. Yeah, I think we call it. Do you want
[39:41.530 --> 39:45.530]  to hear about some of my house hack? Yeah, I want to hear about your house hack. Yeah.
[39:45.650 --> 39:46.730]  Tell me about your house hack.
[40:18.210 --> 40:22.870]  Today's top story, the flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter Group and
[40:22.870 --> 40:26.830]  Chocolatey Corp. Joining me is a PBC executive. Thanks for having me, Barry.
[40:27.210 --> 40:31.750]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct of it, Jif Peanut Butter and Chocolate
[40:31.750 --> 40:35.710]  Flavored Spread, would be a success? You know, it was a gut feeling,
[40:36.490 --> 40:42.430]  rumbling, if you will. Besides, they're two titans of taste. Very true. Goes great with pretzels
[40:42.430 --> 40:49.250]  and pancakes. Apples, too, I bet. Try Jif PBC today. Oh, boy, I guess I'll start with the
[40:49.250 --> 40:57.090]  smallest thing. Took a dump the other day. I love that game. And I've been having a problem with
[40:57.090 --> 41:02.030]  in my bog. I've been having a problem with mosquitoes flying around while I'm taking dumps,
[41:02.810 --> 41:06.070]  biting me, biting my exposed skin and all that. What?
[41:07.970 --> 41:13.550]  It's been a very bad mosquito year. Okay. In Texas. Fair enough. Okay. So I started,
[41:13.750 --> 41:19.910]  I was halfway through my two and before I sat down, I killed a mosquito with a bug zapper
[41:19.910 --> 41:23.770]  because I don't like slamming them because I get blood all over me. So I have a little
[41:23.770 --> 41:34.710]  zapper in there for murking them. The guy, the guy that wants to innovate on the glory hole
[41:34.710 --> 41:39.350]  doesn't like a little bit of bug on him. I've never used a glory hole, I was just thinking
[41:39.350 --> 41:46.070]  about a glory hole. The glory hole guy doesn't want a little sweat on his skin. I've never seen
[41:46.070 --> 41:50.070]  a glory hole, I don't know anything about them. You're making glory holes, you're the glory hole
[41:50.070 --> 41:54.770]  guy. I thought I could innovate, I disobeyed, I've used a glory hole. You know what would be a
[41:54.770 --> 42:03.430]  cool nickname? Glory hole Gavin. Wow. It just kind of works, right? It flows. It's pretty long. GHG,
[42:03.570 --> 42:10.830]  glory hole Gavin. Glory hole Gavin. GHG. G-hole. G-hole. We call you G-hole.
[42:12.330 --> 42:17.110]  Sorry, continue. It's just that I had to, yeah, go ahead. So I zapped a mozzie,
[42:17.110 --> 42:22.350]  dead, dead as dicks, and then I lent the bug zapper up against the wall, and I'm about halfway
[42:22.350 --> 42:31.910]  through my dump, and suddenly an explosion, an absolute bang, and the freaking bug zapper
[42:32.870 --> 42:41.150]  exploded out of the battery holder. Oh. It freaking, look, I've gotta, this is what my wall
[42:41.150 --> 42:48.710]  looks like now. It filled the room with, with like smoke, and it spewed a bunch of black shit
[42:48.710 --> 42:54.630]  into the, into the wall. I have that exact same one. I gotta throw it away. Do you? It's hazardous.
[42:54.730 --> 43:02.170]  I used to. Yeah. And that's a picture of the battery, uh, during my ass, and suddenly I'm,
[43:02.370 --> 43:09.350]  I'm in a room filled with busted battery fumes. So immediately, immediately, I, uh, before the
[43:09.350 --> 43:14.610]  smoke got to me, I took a real deep breath, and I tried to finish up before I had to breathe again.
[43:14.750 --> 43:19.910]  I was panic wiping. I was, I was absolutely annihilating my cornhole, trying to get it
[43:19.910 --> 43:24.870]  cleaned so I could get out of there before I had to breathe again. Absolute nightmare. Probably one
[43:24.870 --> 43:30.230]  of the worst dumps in my life. So I've thrown that away. That was, uh, Haunted House problem one.
[43:31.610 --> 43:37.270]  I don't know what to go with next. Well, before we move on from that, can I just say that if you
[43:37.270 --> 43:41.230]  were ever going to be surprised to the point of shitting yourself, you were in the ideal environment.
[43:44.810 --> 43:51.130]  It's a real, to say I shit myself while already sitting on the toilet is, it's a very low stakes
[43:51.130 --> 43:59.310]  statement. I was in the right place. Second, uh, a raccoon is taking baths in the pool every night.
[43:59.530 --> 44:03.470]  Don't know what to do about that. Um, I was wondering if you were going to talk about that
[44:03.470 --> 44:11.170]  video. Yeah, that's, uh, just coming in, walking around in the pool, leaving.
[44:13.190 --> 44:18.270]  That's, uh, that's problem number one with the pool. What's wrong with the raccoon going in the
[44:18.270 --> 44:23.710]  pool? Why are we against this? Rabies? I don't know. Yeah, you're lucky. Once again, the glory
[44:23.710 --> 44:28.670]  hole guy can't be telling me about dirty. And he's like in there like cleaning his balls and stuff.
[44:29.330 --> 44:31.230]  Everybody's balls is getting clean in there.
[44:35.250 --> 44:39.410]  Ball city in there. I don't know. It just feels a bit more dirty than a raccoon
[44:40.030 --> 44:45.570]  fur is. I don't know. Anyway, that's the easiest problem with the pool. The second problem with the
[44:45.570 --> 44:50.870]  pool is that it's leaking. It's a piece of shit. Uh, it's draining out of the side while I'm waiting
[44:50.870 --> 44:56.990]  for the pool to be repaired while I'm waiting for it to be repaired. Uh, I have to keep topping it up
[44:56.990 --> 45:03.310]  because the pool evaporates anyway. Uh, so you have to put like a hour of water in every two
[45:03.310 --> 45:07.710]  weeks or something. Uh, but the fact that it's leaking means it's doing it slightly faster. So
[45:07.710 --> 45:13.490]  I put the hose in the pool, set a timer for an hour. I came back to see if it topped up nicely.
[45:13.770 --> 45:21.470]  It hadn't. The pool, the hose had exploded off the side of the thing. So the pool got about
[45:22.190 --> 45:28.370]  five minutes of water. And then the ground got about 55. Uh, just wasting water, just pissing
[45:28.370 --> 45:35.230]  water away as the... So I got annoyed. I just turned off the water. I thought, uh, it's probably
[45:35.230 --> 45:38.810]  gonna rain soon. I'll just leave the pool. I think you have to keep it topped up because it's bad for
[45:38.810 --> 45:45.050]  the pumps if air gets in them. And if it drains too much, you get air in them. Uh, about two days
[45:45.050 --> 45:50.810]  later, I took a look at the pool and it was, it was down by instead of like an inch, it was down by
[45:50.810 --> 45:56.910]  about a foot of water. And I was like, Oh my God, how big is this leak? What's going on? I realized
[45:57.490 --> 46:03.210]  I never took the hose out of the water. So because the, the water level is slightly higher than the
[46:03.210 --> 46:09.870]  hose, I've been siphoning. The water had been siphoning out of the hose hole. You drained your
[46:09.870 --> 46:16.050]  pool. I drained my own pool for about two days. I was like, Oh my God, I've wasted even more water.
[46:16.050 --> 46:22.210]  What the hell's happening? And it didn't rain. Dude, the raccoon is going to be so pissed at you.
[46:22.370 --> 46:28.450]  The raccoon would be pissed because the little step he pisses on, washes on is exposed to the
[46:28.450 --> 46:41.490]  air now. Gotta get this pool in order. He's not done, I bet. No. No, I wish I was done.
[46:42.010 --> 46:49.930]  No. Uh, this is probably something I can't show, but I can play the audio in the, in the episode.
[46:50.570 --> 46:57.230]  Let me share my screen here. Okay. So it's nighttime. Okay. 1030. Yeah.
[46:58.670 --> 47:04.170]  Wham! My freaking house just got EMP'd or something. All of my lights went off. What was that?
[47:04.350 --> 47:10.830]  Half the street lights went off. What the fuck was that? And then my freaking air conditioner,
[47:10.830 --> 47:16.070]  which was just running minding its own business, started making the loudest noise in the world.
[47:16.270 --> 47:21.310]  The house was vibrating. I was, it made me jump. All the lights went off and then it went
[47:22.370 --> 47:30.050]  and I was like, Oh, what the hell's happening? Uh, now my AC makes that noise. Always? When it comes
[47:30.050 --> 47:41.990]  on. Had it looked at yet? No, not yet. Not yet. Uh, I've got the fans on, ceiling fans full blast.
[47:42.550 --> 47:47.870]  Starting to get pretty warm. At first I thought my AC broke and like pulled so much power that all
[47:47.870 --> 47:51.710]  my lights went off. But then I noticed on the footage that like half the street went off too.
[47:51.910 --> 47:57.110]  So I don't know what that was. I think I do. I think I can solve this case for you.
[47:57.750 --> 48:04.170]  Real easy. You got a classic over the hedge situation going on. That raccoon was living
[48:04.170 --> 48:10.510]  its best life in your pool. It was having fun. It was swimming. It was enjoying things. You're
[48:10.510 --> 48:15.450]  fucking up the pool. You're ruining it for him. He said, you know what? Go fuck yourself. I'm
[48:15.450 --> 48:20.830]  EMPing your house. Yeah. I'm biting into some cable. Everything's ruined. He chewed some cables.
[48:20.830 --> 48:28.590]  Oh, Gavin just went live again. Oh, is this it? Oh, look at him. Oh, that's a guy who would
[48:28.590 --> 48:36.830]  chew on wires. Dude, that's a guy who would absolutely chew on wires. That's a wire chewing
[48:36.830 --> 48:42.230]  dude right there. That's a guy who's looking for an excuse to chew on wires. Yeah, a hundred
[48:42.230 --> 48:46.970]  percent, dude. Yep. Like he walked out of the house this morning looking to take something
[48:46.970 --> 48:53.450]  personally. Anyway, I'm looking forward to moving and not having a pool. I don't know why
[48:53.450 --> 49:01.750]  it's so much effort to store water. It is. I think what's happened here is that Jeff sold his house.
[49:02.450 --> 49:06.770]  He doesn't have a house anymore. He's a renter, which means that's not his problem. I think
[49:06.770 --> 49:11.090]  that's what it is. Because last time when my house started getting all crazy, it was because Jeff's
[49:11.090 --> 49:16.530]  luck had gone. It started to go better. But I think now that Jeff doesn't have. Yeah. And the
[49:16.530 --> 49:21.630]  problems need to flow somewhere. Are you done, Jeff? Or is there more? That's it for now.
[49:22.670 --> 49:29.510]  What about the fucking the seven billion gnats in your front yard? Oh, I don't even remember that.
[49:29.570 --> 49:35.570]  I've mowed my lawn. Right. And I just started leaving the clippings on the lawn. Just thought
[49:35.570 --> 49:41.970]  I'd try that out because my bin is full of rotten grass. And now there's probably, without
[49:42.970 --> 49:49.870]  exaggeration, five hundred million gnats hovering above the grass. Oh, my God. And maybe like 20
[49:51.410 --> 49:56.670]  things fly like dragonfly sort of shaped things trying to eat them. So there's just a swarm of
[49:57.510 --> 50:02.490]  an absolute war zone above my yard. I went to Gav's house to pick him up because I went to lunch
[50:02.490 --> 50:06.170]  the other day and I didn't want to get I didn't get out of my car. I took one look at it. I was
[50:06.170 --> 50:11.310]  like, I can't look. When I was in the army, we went down to Panama and we had to camp on the
[50:11.310 --> 50:17.670]  Panama Canal, like on the Panama River. And it was like you couldn't you could like physically part
[50:17.670 --> 50:22.510]  the bugs through the air with your hands. That's what it looked like. It looked like Panama. It
[50:22.510 --> 50:28.970]  looked like a hundred degrees, a hundred percent humidity in the middle of a jungle. It was wild.
[50:29.330 --> 50:35.550]  I've Panama'd my frickin... I miss my lawn guy. You do? The one you fired so that you could be a lawn guy?
[50:35.950 --> 50:40.890]  Yeah. Do you think you'll be a lawn guy next year? I don't know. But at the moment, I can't mow it
[50:40.890 --> 50:46.710]  without a bunch of shit flying into my sunglasses. Yeah. What is what are you going to do about it?
[50:46.790 --> 50:56.410]  Like, what's the fix? How do you remedy this? Uh, I don't know. Maybe try early morning. Maybe like
[50:56.410 --> 51:00.610]  6 a.m. mo. Kind of inconsiderate there. I don't know when all that stuff starts getting out there.
[51:01.370 --> 51:03.610]  Maybe try to flush them out with your pool water.
[51:05.930 --> 51:06.750]  Divert the flood.
[51:09.230 --> 51:12.530]  Maybe you should take out, maybe you should get like a blowtorch.
[51:12.830 --> 51:18.790]  Just try to cook them all at once. Yeah. Oh, I like that idea. Seems extreme. Have you seen those videos
[51:18.790 --> 51:23.590]  where like they put the stuff on the grass and they light it on fire and it slow burns across?
[51:24.170 --> 51:28.690]  Oh yeah. I'm wary of any device that kills bugs because I think it will turn on me.
[51:29.010 --> 51:33.030]  And I think maybe a flamethrower might. If a flamethrower decides to explode, I don't...
[51:33.030 --> 51:38.430]  Yeah, I was going to say, your luck this last week or whatever, maybe not so good. Also,
[51:38.610 --> 51:42.330]  you're no good with water, so I can't imagine fire is going to be the move for you.
[51:42.610 --> 51:47.590]  I'm also no good with flamethrowers. I don't know where mine is. That's true. That's true.
[51:48.470 --> 51:54.450]  What is that powder called? What even? Can you buy that? Is it just cotton? What is that?
[51:55.150 --> 52:00.110]  I've never questioned what that is. I don't know. The lawn fire stuff.
[52:00.710 --> 52:03.210]  I wouldn't want to... I mean, it's pretty dry.
[52:04.070 --> 52:09.110]  Yeah, it's a good looking yard. It's a good looking lawn when there's not the
[52:09.750 --> 52:13.550]  10 billion gnats above it. Yeah, there's a bit on the edge that's
[52:13.550 --> 52:17.570]  been unfortunately contaminated with quite a lot of chlorine. It's not doing so well,
[52:17.630 --> 52:25.590]  but other than that, it's pretty good. Oh man, I feel like every year, every day,
[52:25.770 --> 52:29.590]  sorry, not every year. I feel like every day I don't own a house, I get younger.
[52:30.210 --> 52:35.410]  And now it's like I get to watch you guys all get older as I go the other direction. This is great.
[52:35.730 --> 52:41.090]  I have gone very gray since I've got this house. Fuck a house, dude. I actually went by my old
[52:41.090 --> 52:46.410]  house today. Didn't miss it at all. It wasn't nostalgic or anything. Yeah, I rode my bike
[52:46.410 --> 52:49.610]  today. I was going to talk, I have a little thing, but I'll talk about it in the next episode. But
[52:50.270 --> 52:54.450]  I did that thing where a long time ago where I rode my bike and I just made observations about
[52:54.450 --> 52:58.050]  the world from my bike, you know, and things I noticed on my bike. I tried to do that today.
[52:58.050 --> 53:02.250]  Didn't go super great. But in the process, I went up to the old house for the first time
[53:02.250 --> 53:06.270]  in a couple... well, since I moved, I hadn't ridden my bike over there. And I was surprised. I didn't
[53:06.270 --> 53:13.070]  give a shit at all. I didn't miss it. I didn't feel like a tug of nostalgia or it wasn't bittersweet
[53:13.070 --> 53:17.650]  or anything. It was just like, yeah, it's weird how that how that works. That's great. I was
[53:17.650 --> 53:23.690]  hoping you went to your house actively to say, fuck that house. No, I was happy. It actually,
[53:23.690 --> 53:28.530]  honestly, it looked really good. The new owner has taken is taking good care of the yard.
[53:28.770 --> 53:33.850]  I didn't expect him to. And we've been blessed with some rain. So I think that's helped, too.
[53:33.890 --> 53:38.870]  But I was impressed that the house looked well kept and well taken care of. I just was surprised
[53:38.870 --> 53:42.870]  that because I lived there. I was thinking about the way home. I lived there for over five years.
[53:43.670 --> 53:48.190]  God, that's crazy. Seems so near my head. Like Millie went through half of middle school and
[53:48.190 --> 53:53.310]  all of high school out of that house. It was a long time in a life, you know, but it's weird
[53:53.310 --> 53:59.110]  how you can move and just, I don't know, flush all that. Did you fill the beanhole before you left?
[53:59.690 --> 54:04.870]  Yeah, I did. And then I filled it a second and a third time because Albert dug it up.
[54:06.690 --> 54:11.030]  We didn't need the jackhammer after all. No, we did not. We just needed the bulldog.
[54:13.030 --> 54:16.470]  Should have left some beans in the house. Who knows? Maybe I did.
[54:16.470 --> 54:24.850]  Oh, cast iron. Eric, how's your house doing? Thought I had everything solved and then had
[54:24.850 --> 54:33.930]  one of my breakers fail again. So bad. Maybe we both got EMPed. Yeah, I think that the
[54:34.710 --> 54:41.950]  I think the breaker that I have is just I think it trips really easy. And I just need to get
[54:41.950 --> 54:47.370]  like the lifetime warranty line and then have them send me one and then have a guy come out
[54:47.370 --> 54:52.030]  and plug it all in so I don't plug it all in and have one backwards. And then I guess I assume kill
[54:52.030 --> 54:57.410]  myself. But is it just the breaker for one circuit or is it like a no, no, it's the whole like it's
[54:57.410 --> 55:03.650]  the whole like like the whole thing I think needs to be a whole subpanel. Yeah, yeah. Like the whole
[55:03.650 --> 55:10.410]  subpanel needs to be like replaced. I talked to an electrician that was in my neighborhood and
[55:11.710 --> 55:17.030]  he's familiar with the setup and he's like, oh yeah, that has like he's essentially it just came
[55:17.030 --> 55:22.270]  down to like these trip really easily. A lot of times it's not an issue. I've run into this here
[55:22.270 --> 55:26.590]  specifically where all these houses were built at like the same time and everything. And I just have
[55:26.590 --> 55:35.510]  to have to make time to get a guy out here. But I spent 10 hours at our studio yesterday and for
[55:35.510 --> 55:43.330]  100% eat, I just I have not had time. So trying. It's fun. It's great. Are EMPs like they are
[55:43.330 --> 55:48.550]  presented in the movies an actual thing? Has anyone ever actually been EMPed?
[55:51.030 --> 55:55.530]  Yeah, that we're talking about like things that happen in movies that just don't occur.
[55:55.790 --> 56:00.030]  I feel like there are a million more EMPs in fiction than there are in real life.
[56:00.310 --> 56:04.650]  Well, it's a real thing. It definitely didn't happen to my house. I was being dramatic, but
[56:04.650 --> 56:10.690]  yeah, I realized that. I understand. Pulse electromagnetism. Just weaponizing an EMP.
[56:11.450 --> 56:15.250]  So I think about it like in the context of movies, it's always so specific.
[56:15.750 --> 56:20.170]  But there has to be someone in the area whose switch just died. And they're just like they
[56:20.170 --> 56:25.950]  have nothing to do with anything. Just a general the idea of like being collateral damage to an
[56:25.950 --> 56:33.230]  EMP attack is really funny to me. It would just be so annoying and unexplainable. Do you think
[56:33.230 --> 56:39.810]  you would feel it? That's what I was wondering. I don't think I would. Why would you feel it?
[56:40.150 --> 56:45.170]  I don't think so either. But I just it feels like I don't know. It like maybe you're one of those
[56:45.170 --> 56:49.010]  things up a little bit or something. Yeah. Like I don't know. Like you have a feeling of static.
[56:49.150 --> 56:52.930]  Yeah. Like you'd feel it if you had a pacemaker. But I'm talking about just like in general,
[56:53.450 --> 56:57.850]  like static electricity. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's it's that kind of a thing. Like how much does it
[56:57.850 --> 57:02.010]  really range if it's like really strong? Whatever. And then we'll get a bunch of comments. People go
[57:02.010 --> 57:05.850]  I can't believe they thought you could feel that. Look, man, I don't know what it looks like. I
[57:05.850 --> 57:09.670]  don't know what it sounds like. I don't know what it is. Maybe if it's strong enough. Yeah,
[57:09.810 --> 57:14.590]  that's actually that's what I'm thinking. Feeling my teeth, feeling my bones. I mean, it was pretty
[57:14.590 --> 57:19.270]  fucking strong for what it did to your house and half your street. Yeah. Why that raccoon do that?
[57:20.070 --> 57:28.990]  Maybe it would feel like X-Men 2. What? I don't. I don't remember. I'm not I'm I haven't seen that
[57:28.990 --> 57:33.030]  enough to just know what that means. Oh, you don't remember how Magneto escaped his plastic prison?
[57:33.670 --> 57:40.550]  No. He pulls all the iron out of a guy. Yeah. Yeah. He makes he makes like a little pinball.
[57:41.090 --> 57:47.830]  I would think I would remember that. That sounds awesome. To me, it's like one of the most
[57:47.830 --> 57:53.090]  memorable parts of X2. I definitely I definitely remember that. Yeah, absolutely. I think I was
[57:53.090 --> 57:58.170]  probably terrified by it when I saw it. I remember Nightcrawler. I remember thinking Nightcrawler
[57:58.170 --> 58:06.390]  was real cool. X-Men 2. He was real cool. And he's a great host on The Traitors and he's invincible.
[58:07.030 --> 58:13.910]  Oh, yeah. Oh, that's an EMP movie. Goldeneye. Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nuclear
[58:13.910 --> 58:18.450]  explosion in orbit. You bring up a good point, Eric, of not not knowing what it sounds like
[58:18.970 --> 58:22.690]  things that I think I know what they sound like, but only because movies told me
[58:23.190 --> 58:28.030]  like I wonder, like I have an expectation of what an EMP should sound like, but that is entirely
[58:28.030 --> 58:37.030]  informed by movies. And movie sounds are like a guy waving a tin roof into a fan. Like it's not.
[58:38.310 --> 58:42.130]  It's the scanning of a grocery item. What or what else could possibly sound different?
[58:42.490 --> 58:45.370]  There's got to be some cool stuff out there that we go, man, it sounds like that. That's
[58:45.370 --> 58:48.870]  it's way cooler in person. But I think most of the time everything sounds probably worse
[58:48.870 --> 58:54.630]  than in a movie. I think so. Yeah, I agree. Hey, Gavin and I, Gavin and I did something.
[58:55.270 --> 59:03.750]  You did. We met up again. Yeah, we met up again the day I saw the Nats. We went and we had lunch
[59:03.750 --> 59:08.730]  together in a very public place because that's the only way to do something like this. And then we
[59:08.730 --> 59:16.330]  finished, I'm happy to say, 100% finished our smut. Oh, dang. How did that go? How was that?
[59:16.450 --> 59:21.310]  Whoa. Really, really fun. I think it went really well. I don't think either of us remembered 80%
[59:21.310 --> 59:25.350]  of it. So it was as if we were reading it for the first time, which was fun. Yeah,
[59:25.530 --> 59:32.370]  honest, like probably 90%. I didn't remember. It's it's something. It's something. It's about
[59:32.370 --> 59:37.250]  10 pages, real solid single space, you know, 10 pages. We're not trying to get one over
[59:38.130 --> 59:45.270]  on the teacher here. We didn't double space it. It's it's real long. And so are the wieners in
[59:45.270 --> 59:51.290]  the story. And yeah, we're excited about it. I don't know what to do with it, though. Now. I
[59:51.290 --> 59:57.170]  don't know the best way to release this content into the world. Do we give it to the girls at
[59:57.170 --> 01:00:01.350]  the Clutch My Pearls podcast and then let them make an episode out of it? Do they even want to
[01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:06.510]  do that? Or do we do it over here for our audience? Is there are there multiple pieces of content?
[01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:10.170]  Do we just put the ebook up and let people read it if they want? You know what I mean? I don't
[01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:14.410]  know. I don't know. My thinking was that we should try and do both, like give it to the
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:18.670]  Clutch My Pearls podcast if they want to do something with it, but also have a supplemental
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:25.350]  for us where Eric reads it to the group. Oh, I like that idea. Yeah, I mean, I mean,
[01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:29.350]  I absolutely won't read it. But yeah, sure. I think this is a good idea. You won't read the
[01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:34.810]  smut? No, I don't want to read it out loud. Whenever I get an audio book, I always enjoy
[01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:39.730]  it more when the author is dude. Yeah, the author knows the intent and knows what's supposed to be
[01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:43.030]  said each and every time. Like, I don't know why you'd give it to someone else, man. It just feels
[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:47.270]  like something you guys they also can provide additional context like it. I enjoy it more.
[01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:51.430]  I mean, we could chime in, but it should be read by a third party. Yeah, I think it should be read
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:55.590]  by a third party too, because you're getting to see their reaction as they discover it as the
[01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:59.310]  story unfolds. That's not how an audio book works. An audio book, I don't care what their reaction
[01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:05.510]  is. This isn't an audio book. This is a supplemental piece of content. It's regulation
[01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:11.450]  supplemental. I think, you know, if like Eric or I or Nick were to do it, we'd be so focused on that
[01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:17.170]  as opposed to reacting to it. Yeah, I think you want our surprise. You realize here, Andrew,
[01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:21.650]  we haven't asked you to read it. We're just asking you to read it. I think but I think
[01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:25.910]  Andrew understands what's happening here. And so I think he understands what's happening is that if
[01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.350]  you are too intransigent, we're going to move on to him and he's trying to cut it off before we
[01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:34.590]  get there. But I do agree with Gavin. I do think it's more powerful if we don't read it and someone
[01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:38.790]  else does. I mean, I don't care if you agree with Gavin, that doesn't matter. I think it's
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:45.390]  important that the authors read their writing so that way we get I mean, if we if we make an audio
[01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:51.630]  book version that will it will be performed by the authors. Right. Which is what the the
[01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:57.470]  supplemental will be is that we can do that and then we can release it as an audio book for everyone
[01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:08.030]  to listen to. What percentage of it is fucking? Is there any like narrative? I would say the first
[01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:14.890]  seven pages or story. Great. That's great. That's world building for sure. A lot of world building.
[01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:18.990]  You need to understand the motivations. You need to understand why they're in the position that
[01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.190]  they're in and the place that they're in. And then you need to understand what the stakes are
[01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:31.660]  because they are galactic in scale. Galactic is a good teaser. And who better to make me
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.920]  understand that than the authors of this piece as they give it the gravitas it deserves.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:45.240]  How many characters are there? Why don't we just leave them, Jeff, with the the name and the
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:55.700]  the author? Okay. Hold on a sec. Hold on a second. Let me find the hold on. Give me two seconds.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:03.260]  VAMP. This is why this is why the authors can't read it. I'd still you know, this strawberry drink
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:17.240]  still really good. VAMP. That's our pen name. Yeah, I like you know what? That looks more
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:23.360]  professional than I was expecting. Yeah, I think it's less vulgar. No, no, it's yeah, it it does
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:34.260]  read to me. It looks like a book I would grab in Starfield does look like Starfield. Oh, yeah,
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.740]  it you know, it might feel a little bit like Starfield if that's your thing.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:46.120]  Yeah, sure. Sure. I'll say I'll tell you this right now. It has more aliens than Starfield does.
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:54.000]  If you put into your browser, does it lead to our Patreon?
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.140]  I don't think so. That would be awesome if it did.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.200]  I mean, we could get a domain and regulate it to the book.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:09.360]  Have you considered sending this book to any short story type festivals?
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:16.080]  Oh, for publication or to get it like reviewed, see where it places, maybe an award.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.780]  I'm not opposed to it. You probably get this thing a signal award.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:26.520]  It's a wholly original work of fiction that Gavin and I created from the ground up together
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.740]  under the moniker. It's just completely and totally from our minds and own. So I, you know,
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:37.820]  I feel pretty good about putting it out there and seeing how other people feel about it. Is it
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:44.280]  award worthy? Maybe. Last question, we should probably wrap up after this. But Gavin, did you
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:52.600]  have your you're wondering your question about glory holes before or after you wrote? Oh, wow.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.460]  You know, maybe I had a lot of stuff on the mind.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.300]  That's what I'm wondering. And it took me down a path subconsciously.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:04.500]  Yeah, you might be on something there because I did think about this after I hung out with Jeff.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.580]  Are there any glory holes in the book? I mean, I don't want to just for the record. I want to set
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:19.360]  expectations. There are no glory holes in this seed. There are no artificial barriers to the sex
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:27.060]  they get. They want to experience each other and well, everybody in the full regalia of of the
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:32.100]  moment. Yeah, I don't know why my mind is in the gutter for this era, but I think I think it's
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.780]  mostly out of my system now. I just had a couple of questions about happy endings and glory holes
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.080]  and that's about it until we win a Pulitzer and have to make a sequel.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:54.340]  The premise of the stand, the cut out that you put your dick through the Tom Cruise hole.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.160]  Yeah, the crucible. Do you think the larger the character, the less impressive your dick would
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:09.000]  look? Yes. So what if like you did like a Vern? What if there's a scale to test this like it's
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.860]  progressively larger bodies? Yeah, like on a Dinklage, I'm looking good on a like Victor
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:22.640]  Wiminyama. It's I'm comical. I was wondering about this just as an aside. Does height correlate
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:31.480]  to dick size? Like, are they related in any way? I would assume to an extent. I would think to
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:38.280]  an extent, right. But I have no idea. I just have no clue. But I remember Steve Steven Murchin talking
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.620]  about his penis because he gets asked a lot if it's in proportion. And his response typically is
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:49.200]  that he feels like he's been slightly short changed. Yeah, I mean, I've spent a lot my entire
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.800]  life listening to six foot five inch tall Howard Stern talk about how his penis looks like a
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:06.820]  robin's egg in a bird's nest. So yeah, maybe it doesn't. I don't know. Find out next time
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:15.400]  on Regulation Podcast. We went so long, Andrew ended it. I love it. We'll see you guys next week.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:23.620]  We got two of them. Podcasts, not glory holes. Thanks for clarifying. Yeah, thank you.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:28.960]  You're welcome. This is why I don't have a drill. What a mess.
