[00:29.920 --> 00:34.620]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:34.760 --> 00:41.960]  This is episode 37. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Eric Baddour, Gavin Free,
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.960]  and Nick Schwartz. And as I was typing that, I looked down at my phone. I had a text from
[00:47.960 --> 00:52.220]  Bernie Burns. Would anyone like to guess what that text was? Let me ask you a question.
[00:52.220 --> 00:55.740]  How often do you get a text from Bernie Burns, and it's positive?
[00:56.080 --> 01:00.820]  I was going to say the last time I got a text from Bernie, it was probably the day he learned
[01:00.820 --> 01:03.580]  Rooster Teeth was dying, but I did not know yet. So...
[01:03.580 --> 01:09.220]  I guess it's bad news, and I was going to commiserate with you after this.
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.320]  Yeah, I wasn't going to bring it up. I saw it as soon as we ended our last recording.
[01:13.600 --> 01:16.100]  I did not text you. I didn't want to be the one to do it.
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.660]  Literally just found out about it as I was saying the intro.
[01:20.660 --> 01:23.720]  Yeah, do you want to stop down, or what's up?
[01:23.780 --> 01:27.480]  No, no, I'll be fine. Sorry, we're talking around it to the audience,
[01:27.660 --> 01:32.220]  but Bernie just let me know that one of my three or four heroes of my life,
[01:32.700 --> 01:33.660]  David Lynch, just died.
[01:34.480 --> 01:35.360]  Creative genius.
[01:35.860 --> 01:40.660]  That's a weird... I was weirdly struck by emotion there for a second, but yeah,
[01:40.700 --> 01:47.480]  that's incredibly sad. David Lynch, one of the most brilliant auteurs in the history of our country,
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.740]  and has provided me with a lifetime of entertainment.
[01:52.700 --> 01:57.420]  And he also smoked every day of his life and developed emphysema so badly
[01:57.420 --> 02:01.960]  that he had to stop directing, doing the thing that he truly loved in life,
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.060]  because his health was so poor from the fucking emphysema.
[02:07.020 --> 02:09.260]  Don't smoke like David Lynch. I don't know why he died,
[02:09.340 --> 02:12.800]  but I'm going to guess it was emphysema related. He died at 78, which is far too young.
[02:13.100 --> 02:16.040]  He should be directing movies into his 90s like fucking Clint Eastwood.
[02:16.660 --> 02:19.100]  Um, but he's not. So don't smoke.
[02:19.220 --> 02:23.220]  Clint Eastwood still... he doesn't even care if the film is in focus,
[02:23.380 --> 02:25.920]  which is what I appreciate about current day Clint Eastwood.
[02:26.560 --> 02:30.640]  Yeah, you'll watch a Clint Eastwood movie and it'll just be out of focus for a frame,
[02:30.700 --> 02:32.340]  and it's like, he doesn't give a fuck. He's a 90.
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.800]  Oh, I don't think the director has much say over whether it's in focus or not.
[02:36.860 --> 02:39.320]  I feel like he's behind the lens. He's going...
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.900]  I don't think people like block out a scene and then at the last minute say,
[02:43.900 --> 02:45.580]  oh, by the way, in focus action.
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.240]  I don't think there's anything that Clint does on that set that like,
[02:50.280 --> 02:51.400]  I think he's in control of it all.
[02:51.980 --> 02:53.880]  I don't think there's anything that happens he doesn't know about.
[02:54.320 --> 02:56.320]  I think someone says, oh, we're kind of out of focus.
[02:56.320 --> 02:58.760]  And he goes, who gives a fuck? And then they move to the next.
[02:59.520 --> 03:02.780]  Someone knows. Somebody would know and somebody report to Clint.
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.220]  We have all kinds of stuff to talk about, not the least of which is Last Weekend.
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.740]  And I'd like to zag really fast to take my mind off of David Lynch for a second,
[03:11.780 --> 03:12.240]  if you don't mind.
[03:12.520 --> 03:12.880]  Of course.
[03:12.880 --> 03:16.200]  I was at the airport a day ago or so,
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.920]  and I discovered a candy that is the funniest candy name I've ever heard in my entire life.
[03:22.280 --> 03:25.080]  And it's too silly to be sat around.
[03:25.460 --> 03:26.820]  So I didn't buy it.
[03:26.900 --> 03:28.040]  And now I kind of wish I had.
[03:28.360 --> 03:29.520]  Maybe we could try to get some.
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.280]  This is when we were leaving Cancun.
[03:31.660 --> 03:32.540]  I put it in the Discord.
[03:32.900 --> 03:35.540]  I noticed Squinkles Chunks.
[03:35.820 --> 03:37.660]  Hell yeah, Squinkles Chunks.
[03:38.940 --> 03:39.900]  Squinkles Chunks.
[03:39.980 --> 03:41.360]  What are Squinkles Chunks?
[03:41.360 --> 03:43.200]  We couldn't stop saying it.
[03:43.340 --> 03:47.260]  You had a bag of Squinkles Chunks in your hand that you didn't pull the trigger.
[03:47.280 --> 03:49.700]  That's what I told him, I said go back and buy Squinkles Chunks.
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.700]  He wouldn't do it.
[03:50.760 --> 03:52.040]  He did not buy Squinkles Chunks.
[03:52.380 --> 03:52.780]  What?
[03:53.140 --> 03:55.940]  Because I was in the throes of...
[03:55.940 --> 03:59.100]  Listen, I was deep into the diarrhea at that point.
[03:59.260 --> 04:03.000]  And I was heavily distracted.
[04:03.280 --> 04:04.060]  I was heavily distracted.
[04:04.420 --> 04:07.140]  I am alarmed by the grape colors.
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.100]  Are those grapes?
[04:08.280 --> 04:08.700]  What are those?
[04:08.700 --> 04:11.960]  The coloring of the fruit is alarming on the package.
[04:12.280 --> 04:13.280]  You got grapes for that?
[04:13.320 --> 04:13.900]  Is that grape?
[04:15.040 --> 04:16.160]  Are those cherries?
[04:17.640 --> 04:18.580]  What are they?
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.820]  The artist's rendition above the K in Squinkles makes it look like long combos,
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.720]  but they look nothing like combos in the bag.
[04:26.840 --> 04:27.820]  And what is that little diagram?
[04:27.940 --> 04:28.500]  Like a bean?
[04:28.740 --> 04:30.840]  There's like three beans in a pod of some sort.
[04:30.920 --> 04:32.740]  That's what I was saying was the cherry or grapes.
[04:33.100 --> 04:35.200]  Well, I assume it's like tamarind or something, right?
[04:35.340 --> 04:35.680]  Probably.
[04:35.680 --> 04:36.140]  Sorry, sorry.
[04:36.220 --> 04:37.880]  Wait, which cherries and grapes?
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.040]  Together in a in a bean case.
[04:41.220 --> 04:43.940]  Yeah, I thought that I couldn't tell the casing.
[04:44.060 --> 04:48.000]  I thought maybe, you know, when you grab a thing of grapes and they're on the stem
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.480]  and they're like next to each other, like it's just we couldn't see any of the like.
[04:52.640 --> 04:53.540]  I tell you something, though.
[04:53.660 --> 04:57.580]  If a grape grew in like a five pack, I would love that.
[04:57.940 --> 04:59.080]  Yeah, that'd be delicious.
[04:59.460 --> 05:02.740]  They wait, but they grow in like a 30 pack.
[05:02.780 --> 05:05.040]  You could just get a bundle that's six times better.
[05:05.180 --> 05:06.600]  He wants in a row, I think.
[05:06.600 --> 05:09.900]  Yeah, like if they were like that picture where they were like there's like a big skin
[05:09.900 --> 05:11.400]  and then they were like three grapes inside.
[05:11.660 --> 05:13.100]  You want grapes like peas?
[05:14.440 --> 05:15.560]  I think it'd be good.
[05:15.820 --> 05:18.640]  Has anybody ever eaten grapes and cherries at the same time?
[05:18.760 --> 05:19.940]  You might be on to something there.
[05:20.260 --> 05:24.920]  What if you cut a grape in half and a cherry in half and then you stuck that together?
[05:25.360 --> 05:25.920]  A chape?
[05:25.940 --> 05:27.420]  You made a chape, yeah.
[05:27.920 --> 05:29.500]  I would love to try making a chape.
[05:29.520 --> 05:32.080]  A Gary flavored chape.
[05:33.700 --> 05:35.720]  So what's bigger, a cherry or a grape?
[05:36.740 --> 05:37.920]  I can get them in the same size.
[05:38.200 --> 05:39.860]  I think one could be bigger than the other on either side.
[05:39.860 --> 05:41.040]  I think we should turducken this.
[05:41.140 --> 05:45.580]  I think it should be like a cherry and a grape and then a cranberry inside of that.
[05:46.980 --> 05:48.760]  Cherry, grape, turducken...
[05:48.760 --> 05:51.640]  I'm trying to think like other berries that you can progressively...
[05:52.480 --> 05:54.640]  Jeff, I don't want to alarm you.
[05:54.700 --> 05:55.880]  Did another one of my heroes die?
[05:56.120 --> 05:57.160]  Did another one of my heroes just die?
[05:57.280 --> 05:57.560]  No.
[05:58.140 --> 05:58.340]  Okay.
[05:58.820 --> 06:00.460]  H-E-B sells squinkles chunks.
[06:01.040 --> 06:01.680]  Hell yeah!
[06:02.360 --> 06:03.160]  Oh my god.
[06:03.360 --> 06:05.080]  Can we like instacart some?
[06:06.860 --> 06:08.480]  Jeff, instacart some squinkles chunks.
[06:08.540 --> 06:08.980]  All right, all right.
[06:09.000 --> 06:09.340]  Hold on.
[06:09.460 --> 06:10.040]  Let me get back.
[06:10.100 --> 06:10.940]  What was the cranberry?
[06:11.320 --> 06:12.540]  Let me get the other thing down first.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.240]  Cranberry, grape, cherry.
[06:14.660 --> 06:15.760]  Yeah, it's turducken, turducken.
[06:16.240 --> 06:18.500]  So H-E-B has squinkles chunks.
[06:18.940 --> 06:21.020]  Yeah, and get some cranchapes as well.
[06:21.600 --> 06:23.680]  My H-E-B doesn't have to do us a favor.
[06:24.160 --> 06:24.800]  Well, he does that.
[06:24.880 --> 06:26.260]  Can I, can I pivot really quickly?
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.300]  Just a very brief.
[06:27.340 --> 06:27.520]  Yeah.
[06:27.980 --> 06:28.320]  Loden.
[06:30.200 --> 06:31.260]  And Loden was the wrong word.
[06:31.340 --> 06:32.880]  Loden is because I'm looking at what's on my screen.
[06:33.700 --> 06:34.660]  What the fuck?
[06:34.660 --> 06:35.880]  And I know we've been talking about a lot.
[06:35.940 --> 06:37.000]  I hope people aren't annoyed by it.
[06:37.280 --> 06:39.580]  What is overtime rumble in GTA 5?
[06:40.080 --> 06:41.680]  How have, what, what is this?
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.640]  How have we not done this?
[06:43.060 --> 06:45.680]  Is that the like land on the platform with the scores thing?
[06:45.840 --> 06:46.480]  I don't know what it is.
[06:46.800 --> 06:47.460]  Look at this.
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.920]  Look how fucking cool that looks.
[06:49.380 --> 06:52.000]  Yeah, we made like 150 videos in that, I think.
[06:52.060 --> 06:52.700]  I didn't know that.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.360]  Are you playing GTA right now, Andrew?
[06:54.620 --> 06:56.800]  No, I was just seeing what the update was.
[06:57.140 --> 06:59.140]  You said, what do you mean you're not playing?
[06:59.220 --> 07:02.040]  You said the word loading because you're loading GTA.
[07:02.640 --> 07:03.920]  No, now I'm entering online.
[07:03.920 --> 07:04.780]  It doesn't say loading.
[07:04.920 --> 07:05.520]  It says entering.
[07:05.680 --> 07:08.500]  You said you weren't going to do this anymore.
[07:08.640 --> 07:09.080]  Yeah, I'm closing.
[07:09.260 --> 07:09.880]  I'm out. I'm out.
[07:09.960 --> 07:10.160]  I'm out.
[07:10.200 --> 07:10.940]  Listen, I have a problem.
[07:11.020 --> 07:11.520]  I'm an addiction.
[07:11.640 --> 07:12.180]  I can't stop.
[07:12.240 --> 07:12.540]  I'm sorry.
[07:12.700 --> 07:16.000]  Not available for online order delivery.
[07:16.100 --> 07:16.400]  Of course.
[07:16.900 --> 07:17.260]  However.
[07:17.800 --> 07:20.100]  Okay, so do they have squinklote?
[07:21.280 --> 07:21.640]  Squinklote?
[07:21.640 --> 07:22.840]  I didn't know anything squinky.
[07:23.580 --> 07:26.640]  I'll take a trip to my ATB right after this and I'll get some.
[07:26.720 --> 07:27.300]  I'll squink up.
[07:27.560 --> 07:28.640]  Who's that cool duck?
[07:29.280 --> 07:30.420]  Hold on, squink up.
[07:30.520 --> 07:31.080]  Let me write that down.
[07:31.160 --> 07:33.640]  So they've got squinklote and squinkles chunks.
[07:33.640 --> 07:35.720]  Is there like an original squink?
[07:35.920 --> 07:37.660]  Like just like a normal squinkle?
[07:37.880 --> 07:38.200]  I don't know.
[07:38.400 --> 07:40.640]  Yeah, what's just a bog standard squinkle?
[07:41.620 --> 07:43.440]  That's the title of the episode.
[07:43.820 --> 07:45.800]  A bog standard squinkle.
[07:46.260 --> 07:48.920]  Also, Andrew, Overtime Rumble is amazing.
[07:49.300 --> 07:50.260]  It looks so much fun.
[07:50.320 --> 07:54.080]  It is all the best of that game where you...
[07:54.080 --> 07:55.140]  What was the monkey ball?
[07:55.260 --> 07:56.100]  It's kind of like monkey ball.
[07:56.300 --> 07:56.720]  Oh, okay.
[07:57.240 --> 07:57.740]  Oh, awesome.
[07:58.060 --> 07:58.620]  I love monkey ball.
[08:00.000 --> 08:00.440]  Squinklote.
[08:00.520 --> 08:01.560]  I'm looking into this.
[08:01.600 --> 08:02.820]  I'm going to get myself some squinklote.
[08:02.820 --> 08:06.900]  Maybe next episode we try some on the show if we can all get it in time.
[08:07.080 --> 08:08.040]  I think that's a great idea.
[08:08.180 --> 08:10.920]  And I thank you guys for allowing me to zag for a second there.
[08:11.000 --> 08:11.680]  That is squink.
[08:12.020 --> 08:14.640]  Squinkles chunks has completely lifted my spirits.
[08:14.700 --> 08:15.240]  What the fuck?
[08:15.560 --> 08:16.140]  Have you...
[08:16.500 --> 08:17.200]  It's orange.
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.620]  There's an orange squinklote.
[08:19.200 --> 08:21.380]  We got to sync up on what squinklote we're getting.
[08:21.800 --> 08:22.640]  We got to squink up.
[08:25.540 --> 08:27.060]  We should stop syncing up.
[08:27.160 --> 08:29.100]  We should only squink up from here on out.
[08:29.740 --> 08:31.460]  Oh, we need to huddle up is what we need to do.
[08:31.460 --> 08:33.160]  Brother, it's getting weirder.
[08:33.420 --> 08:36.900]  What? I'm looking up what original squinkles are.
[08:37.260 --> 08:38.160]  I can't...
[08:38.660 --> 08:40.220]  What is happening?
[08:40.800 --> 08:42.620]  Gavin, what does that say?
[08:43.120 --> 08:43.560]  Sal...
[08:44.200 --> 08:45.040]  Sal...
[08:46.440 --> 08:47.320]  Squinklesasparilla?
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.560]  Salsa Getty, you idiot!
[08:49.920 --> 08:51.380]  Sprinkles Salsa Getty!
[08:51.940 --> 08:52.820]  Sprinkles...
[08:53.740 --> 08:55.400]  It's fucking candy spaghetti.
[08:59.380 --> 09:00.260]  This is...
[09:00.700 --> 09:01.100]  What?
[09:01.680 --> 09:03.560]  Squinkles has opened our minds.
[09:03.600 --> 09:05.880]  Should we do the squink gauntlet?
[09:06.360 --> 09:07.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[09:07.160 --> 09:11.300]  Also, the squinkle duck looks cool as fuck.
[09:11.300 --> 09:13.120]  I'm trying to learn about this duck.
[09:13.220 --> 09:15.120]  However, Squinkles Rihannos...
[09:16.560 --> 09:19.000]  Yeah, Squinkles Rihannos is not looking...
[09:19.000 --> 09:19.940]  That looks awful.
[09:20.680 --> 09:21.420]  That looks diseased.
[09:21.860 --> 09:22.120]  Yeah.
[09:22.500 --> 09:22.820]  Dusty.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.760]  I would eat it like crazy, though.
[09:24.760 --> 09:25.560]  I just got to say.
[09:26.040 --> 09:29.600]  I am excited for next episode when we have SquinkFest 2025.
[09:30.900 --> 09:31.380]  SquinkFest!
[09:31.720 --> 09:32.760]  Yo, what's up, Squinkles?
[09:32.760 --> 09:36.080]  If you want to sponsor this podcast, please let us know.
[09:36.280 --> 09:37.920]  We would squink like crazy, dude.
[09:38.260 --> 09:39.740]  Hey, yeah, we would squink all over the place.
[09:39.860 --> 09:40.900]  And then that goes for the audience, too.
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.620]  Hey, we're announcing now next episode is going to be SquinkFest 2025.
[09:44.900 --> 09:48.080]  If you want to squink along with us, check out your local grocery store.
[09:48.180 --> 09:51.160]  See if you can squink out because it's going to be squink-tastic.
[09:51.560 --> 09:52.920]  See if you can squink out?
[09:54.760 --> 09:56.780]  Dude, Squinkles is crazy.
[09:57.600 --> 09:59.040]  Man, I'm so glad I took that photo.
[09:59.780 --> 10:00.780]  Man, you never know.
[10:01.740 --> 10:02.960]  You never fucking know.
[10:03.420 --> 10:05.140]  Yeah, Squinkles.
[10:05.480 --> 10:07.880]  Why can't I find out more info on this goddamn duck?
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.680]  I would assume it's in Spanish if you find anything about it, right?
[10:12.760 --> 10:14.720]  I'm just trying to find a website or anything.
[10:15.100 --> 10:15.940]  I want work.
[10:16.040 --> 10:17.780]  Like, I'm fine with it being in the wrong language.
[10:20.380 --> 10:21.600]  I expect that.
[10:22.160 --> 10:24.460]  We did better in the wrong language than in our language.
[10:26.520 --> 10:28.360]  Andrew's referencing a video we recorded earlier.
[10:28.800 --> 10:30.100]  I was just being a general.
[10:30.100 --> 10:31.080]  I can handle...
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.540]  I trust that I can decipher the words eventually.
[10:34.780 --> 10:35.840]  I just need the words.
[10:36.480 --> 10:38.460]  The problem is the lack of the words.
[10:38.860 --> 10:40.420]  You can contact them.
[10:40.500 --> 10:42.680]  They have an email address if you want to contact them for help.
[10:43.080 --> 10:44.160]  Yes, I would love to.
[10:44.480 --> 10:45.260]  Okay, here.
[10:45.700 --> 10:46.800]  You know who you're talking to.
[10:47.120 --> 10:48.140]  Drop that in there for you.
[10:48.660 --> 10:50.220]  This fucking duck is so cool.
[10:50.500 --> 10:54.000]  There's a contact at the bottom of that page if you want to go ahead and contact Squinkles.
[10:54.940 --> 10:56.620]  Well, it's Lucas is the name of the company,
[10:56.760 --> 10:58.580]  which is like where all the Mexican candy comes from.
[10:58.580 --> 11:00.420]  That's all we ate when we were kids.
[11:00.820 --> 11:04.720]  Not Squinkles, but like Lucas Mexican candy.
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.680]  That's awesome.
[11:07.320 --> 11:10.140]  Should we dive into what some of us did last weekend?
[11:10.680 --> 11:10.980]  Yeah.
[11:11.260 --> 11:12.280]  I would love to know.
[11:12.700 --> 11:13.300]  Yeah, me too.
[11:15.360 --> 11:23.020]  Okay, well, on Thursday, Eric and Gavin and I and then all of our wives
[11:23.940 --> 11:32.020]  went to Cancun to the exact same all-inclusive hotel resort where we met the Falcon.
[11:32.480 --> 11:34.240]  And I discovered the stars.
[11:35.160 --> 11:37.540]  Happy to report the Falcon was there again.
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.860]  Unhappy to report there were zero stars the entire trip.
[11:42.280 --> 11:43.720]  Yeah, I still don't know what stars is.
[11:44.100 --> 11:45.280]  Oh, they don't have them anymore.
[11:45.800 --> 11:48.720]  Stars are fucking stars fell out of that sky, unfortunately.
[11:49.560 --> 11:52.120]  Yeah, so we went for like a similar kind of thing to two years ago,
[11:52.120 --> 11:54.260]  like a little four-day weekend beach getaway,
[11:54.400 --> 12:00.980]  where we were just going to lay around and do nothing at all the entire time.
[12:01.740 --> 12:03.300]  And I think we kind of accomplished that.
[12:03.640 --> 12:06.320]  What Gavin has posted there, or Eric whoever posted that,
[12:06.560 --> 12:09.000]  is a photo of the Falcon shitting.
[12:09.500 --> 12:11.720]  I did not know that's how a Falcon takes a shit.
[12:11.820 --> 12:13.420]  I didn't realize it has to get its wings up.
[12:13.700 --> 12:15.940]  Does it shit on the back of its wings if it doesn't do that?
[12:15.980 --> 12:18.240]  It turns into a triangle when it shits.
[12:18.240 --> 12:20.480]  It turns into like mid-air Angry Birds.
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.260]  I feel like when you're shitting, you're pretty vulnerable.
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.260]  And the Falcon is letting everybody know,
[12:26.340 --> 12:27.680]  I'm still ready to attack you.
[12:27.840 --> 12:28.520]  I'll still kill you.
[12:29.540 --> 12:32.480]  We spent a lot of time with that Falcon and near that Falcon.
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.920]  And we took a bunch of photos with it that we're hoping we can turn into a shirt
[12:35.920 --> 12:38.880]  similar to the Sloppy Joe shirt that we sold when we were a fucking face.
[12:39.140 --> 12:41.160]  Does anybody have any photos of the Falcon, of us with the Falcon?
[12:41.640 --> 12:42.380]  Might be me.
[12:42.740 --> 12:44.160]  Yeah, no, I have to.
[12:45.140 --> 12:49.480]  Your lovely wife sent them and they're very good.
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.340]  They look great, but they refused to save to my phone.
[12:54.800 --> 12:57.880]  So when I had to go scroll through to download them again,
[12:58.620 --> 13:02.480]  I just saw Gavin taking a picture of the back of my head, which,
[13:04.180 --> 13:06.460]  yeah, not necessarily what I was looking for.
[13:06.540 --> 13:07.980]  We got breakfast at the same time.
[13:08.400 --> 13:11.800]  So you decided to take a picture of the back of my head,
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.760]  which, you know, again, not super thrilled about, but thank you very much.
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.960]  Yeah, I had to angle it right because I didn't want to take a picture of your small wife.
[13:22.420 --> 13:23.960]  I just didn't want to weird her out.
[13:24.040 --> 13:25.220]  So I blocked her with you.
[13:27.540 --> 13:29.260]  I can't find these photos now.
[13:29.720 --> 13:31.420]  Did she delete them?
[13:31.640 --> 13:33.980]  I also am having trouble finding these photos.
[13:34.340 --> 13:35.500]  I think she deleted the photos.
[13:35.800 --> 13:37.080]  She doesn't want us to have them?
[13:37.580 --> 13:38.520]  No, no, no, no.
[13:39.300 --> 13:40.180]  Here's one right here.
[13:40.300 --> 13:41.460]  Oh, save shared photo.
[13:41.600 --> 13:43.340]  It's a shared photo, so I can save it.
[13:43.760 --> 13:43.920]  Stupid.
[13:45.760 --> 13:46.440]  Here's a couple.
[13:46.760 --> 13:48.960]  Let me discord these bad boys.
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.400]  Feel free to vamp while I'm doing this.
[13:52.140 --> 13:53.980]  I'm just looking at other Mexican candy.
[13:54.180 --> 13:55.720]  There's four of you, so I figured one of you.
[13:55.820 --> 13:59.280]  I'm looking at have you have you heard of cranky, cranky candy?
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.500]  Oh, this looks even better.
[14:01.960 --> 14:02.600]  Here we go.
[14:02.620 --> 14:05.300]  They got the coolest logos for Mexican candy.
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.240]  I'm a big fan of this.
[14:06.560 --> 14:08.740]  So there's us with the Falcon and the Falcon lady.
[14:08.860 --> 14:12.740]  We figured we could Photoshop Nick and Andrew's head on top of her, maybe.
[14:12.940 --> 14:13.800]  Oh, I love it.
[14:14.320 --> 14:16.080]  Yeah, there's a great one with the Falcon.
[14:16.080 --> 14:18.580]  Then we got one of the Falcon mid-flight, which is pretty cool.
[14:19.200 --> 14:20.000]  He scared me.
[14:20.340 --> 14:21.800]  Eric is alarmed.
[14:21.880 --> 14:23.400]  Oh, man, he got he really.
[14:24.580 --> 14:27.160]  Got there's something in, like, my monkey brain that went like,
[14:27.280 --> 14:28.680]  get away from this thing that's about to get.
[14:29.520 --> 14:30.680]  He was trying to get me.
[14:30.980 --> 14:32.040]  It's facing me.
[14:32.220 --> 14:33.540]  Look at how big, like, zoom in.
[14:33.640 --> 14:35.820]  Look at how big it's toenails, claws.
[14:35.960 --> 14:37.080]  Look at how big its claws are.
[14:37.860 --> 14:38.220]  Talons.
[14:38.740 --> 14:39.100]  Talons.
[14:39.300 --> 14:40.380]  Thank you, boy.
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.040]  Couldn't listen.
[14:42.140 --> 14:43.200]  I got popcorn seeds.
[14:43.420 --> 14:43.760]  I get it.
[14:43.760 --> 14:46.680]  Is the talon the claw or is it the whole foot grabby?
[14:47.860 --> 14:49.640]  Oh, foot grabby?
[14:49.640 --> 14:52.660]  Like, is it just the feet or is it?
[14:53.000 --> 14:53.920]  I think it's all the feet.
[14:54.220 --> 14:55.080]  Yeah, I think it's all of it.
[14:55.300 --> 14:55.980]  It's like a collective.
[14:56.320 --> 14:56.540]  Yeah.
[14:56.800 --> 14:57.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.160]  I didn't like being that close to it when it started getting big.
[15:01.320 --> 15:04.000]  It got very big, which is very scary.
[15:04.180 --> 15:09.180]  But very cool that they let us take pictures near the Falcon on the first day.
[15:09.640 --> 15:11.760]  On the first day I was there, I asked if I could take a picture
[15:11.760 --> 15:14.520]  with the Falcon and the guy said, yeah, you can't hold it.
[15:14.580 --> 15:16.500]  And I went, yeah, no, I'm not trying to.
[15:16.600 --> 15:18.620]  I just want to take a picture near it, man.
[15:18.760 --> 15:20.140]  We absolutely were trying to hold it.
[15:20.400 --> 15:22.760]  Yeah, and then that set us in that direction.
[15:22.920 --> 15:25.020]  The other thing, I thought the Falcon was great.
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.120]  The other thing that Gavin learned was about tres leches cakes,
[15:30.400 --> 15:31.680]  which means three milks.
[15:31.920 --> 15:33.520]  And then Gavin, how many milks is this?
[15:34.300 --> 15:35.200]  That was six milks.
[15:36.880 --> 15:37.980]  There's six milks.
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.220]  Everything was translated into English, including tres leches cakes,
[15:42.440 --> 15:44.720]  which is just called three milk cake.
[15:45.200 --> 15:46.560]  Very strange to see on a menu.
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.900]  We were at dessert and at one of the restaurants,
[15:50.020 --> 15:52.060]  the guy goes, what the fuck is three milk cake?
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.460]  And I was like, think about it for a second.
[15:53.580 --> 15:54.260]  And he's like, what?
[15:54.520 --> 15:56.040]  I was like, think about it.
[15:56.340 --> 15:57.000]  And he's like, what?
[15:57.280 --> 15:58.460]  And tres leches idiot.
[15:58.520 --> 16:02.460]  And he goes, I saw Gavin realize his own stupidity in the moment,
[16:02.480 --> 16:03.720]  and it was kind of depressing.
[16:04.820 --> 16:07.040]  Because it really, you could tell he felt really dumb.
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.480]  I'd never done the translation before.
[16:10.400 --> 16:11.820]  I've also never had, it's foul.
[16:11.940 --> 16:12.460]  It's disgusting.
[16:12.680 --> 16:13.180]  I don't like it.
[16:13.820 --> 16:14.700]  Well, Nick likes everything.
[16:14.800 --> 16:15.800]  I don't think I've ever had it.
[16:15.940 --> 16:17.180]  Milk's fucking gross to begin with.
[16:18.480 --> 16:20.460]  You just have a bunch of milk and you call it a cake?
[16:20.620 --> 16:21.640]  No, it's a good cake.
[16:21.760 --> 16:25.440]  No, it's just made with three different milks,
[16:25.560 --> 16:26.780]  but it's not like a milky cake.
[16:26.880 --> 16:28.100]  No, it's a wet bread cake.
[16:28.320 --> 16:29.180]  It's super moist.
[16:29.560 --> 16:30.040]  It's not.
[16:30.740 --> 16:31.600]  It's not wet.
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.420]  It's not like it's wet.
[16:33.580 --> 16:34.380]  It's just cake.
[16:34.620 --> 16:35.800]  It's cake.
[16:35.800 --> 16:36.700]  It's just cake.
[16:36.940 --> 16:37.280]  Like, look.
[16:37.480 --> 16:37.660]  It's moist.
[16:38.380 --> 16:40.660]  It's just, Andrew, it's just cake.
[16:41.020 --> 16:41.720]  What do you mean it's not wet?
[16:41.740 --> 16:43.320]  It's sat in a puddle of milk.
[16:43.800 --> 16:46.360]  Yeah, it looks, the bottom definitely.
[16:46.400 --> 16:47.860]  Look at the sheen on the left side.
[16:48.120 --> 16:52.980]  And the bubbles up the front.
[16:53.260 --> 16:55.440]  You're a maniac if you think that's not wet.
[16:55.760 --> 16:57.380]  Yeah, that's definitely wet at the bottom.
[16:58.040 --> 16:58.640]  Nah, it's normal.
[16:59.120 --> 17:02.220]  One of the highlights of our trip, our time in the ocean.
[17:02.220 --> 17:05.640]  We could talk about Sunglasses and the whole Sunglasses saga.
[17:06.360 --> 17:08.560]  We could talk about Montezuma's Revenge.
[17:09.200 --> 17:11.300]  We could talk about the show I watched, Urban.
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.700]  It was, oh, we could talk about how everybody got TV in English but Jeff and Emily.
[17:18.020 --> 17:21.820]  Meg kept watching episodes of CSI on TNT.
[17:21.960 --> 17:23.460]  It was like playing CSI constantly.
[17:23.780 --> 17:26.660]  And we'd come to breakfast and she'd be like, oh, this is what happened on CSI last night.
[17:26.960 --> 17:29.720]  Everybody, we should all be watching CSI at night when we go to bed.
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.880]  And everybody was able to, but our TV was only in Spanish.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.700]  We had all the same channels, but they were all in Spanish.
[17:36.720 --> 17:39.420]  And there was nothing on the remote or the TV that would let me change it.
[17:39.600 --> 17:43.600]  And so everybody got to have these like in-depth CSI conversations every morning.
[17:43.640 --> 17:44.840]  And we were left the fuck out.
[17:45.260 --> 17:47.900]  I like that it was like, oh, this is what happened on CSI last night,
[17:48.200 --> 17:50.480]  even though it was last night in 2004.
[17:51.240 --> 17:56.660]  Well, it sparked a whole conversation that we'll get into either here or in Sausage
[17:56.660 --> 17:58.960]  Talk about an idea around old content.
[17:59.260 --> 18:00.700]  It was actually pretty fruitful.
[18:01.460 --> 18:05.940]  Also, we learned that... I didn't know that this was a thing.
[18:06.500 --> 18:07.980]  Because I kind of grew up on the Gulf Coast.
[18:08.040 --> 18:08.980]  I spent a lot of time in the ocean.
[18:09.180 --> 18:11.480]  But we learned you can be bad at ocean.
[18:12.020 --> 18:12.420]  Really?
[18:12.780 --> 18:12.800]  Yeah.
[18:12.940 --> 18:13.340]  Yeah.
[18:13.380 --> 18:16.020]  And one of us is naturally bad at ocean.
[18:17.120 --> 18:17.880]  Who do you think?
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.180]  I think Eric is bad at ocean.
[18:20.280 --> 18:21.060]  He's bad at ocean.
[18:21.460 --> 18:22.420]  I'm not bad at ocean.
[18:22.600 --> 18:24.400]  My sunglasses stayed on the whole time.
[18:24.960 --> 18:26.360]  I didn't lose any.
[18:26.580 --> 18:32.460]  I did get slammed so hard in the ear with a wave that I think I got a very small ear infection.
[18:32.820 --> 18:33.180]  But, you know.
[18:33.240 --> 18:33.600]  Oh, no.
[18:33.820 --> 18:38.940]  Yeah, you recoiled like someone like the ocean just grew a hand and slapped you.
[18:39.120 --> 18:40.960]  It went into my brain.
[18:41.180 --> 18:42.040]  It went into my brain.
[18:42.380 --> 18:46.440]  Every time I turned around, Eric was eating three gallons of saltwater.
[18:46.740 --> 18:48.840]  It was just like it had it in for him.
[18:48.900 --> 18:52.160]  It was slapping him around like a gnat all day long.
[18:52.280 --> 18:52.760]  It was bad.
[18:52.980 --> 18:53.680]  It was really bad.
[18:53.680 --> 18:55.400]  The waves started getting crazy.
[18:55.580 --> 18:56.440]  It started getting nuts.
[18:56.780 --> 19:01.600]  And if you're far enough into the ocean, a big, big wave that will break in, you know,
[19:01.640 --> 19:05.560]  great fashion at the end of the sand, you just kind of float over it as though it's nothing.
[19:05.760 --> 19:06.860]  And I was a little bit further out.
[19:06.940 --> 19:09.120]  So I was just bobbing over these giant waves.
[19:09.500 --> 19:14.060]  And then I would hear the break on Eric's head and it would just be screaming my eyes.
[19:14.220 --> 19:16.040]  I couldn't get closer.
[19:16.200 --> 19:17.280]  It kept pushing me away.
[19:17.580 --> 19:18.880]  It was fighting me big style.
[19:19.000 --> 19:19.520]  I hated it.
[19:19.520 --> 19:23.280]  He had like, he had like 11 drinks in him, too.
[19:23.380 --> 19:26.000]  So he was just like challenging and yelling at the ocean.
[19:26.360 --> 19:27.360]  It was a thing to behold.
[19:27.760 --> 19:29.000]  Meg was very entertained.
[19:29.120 --> 19:29.480]  We were laughing.
[19:29.800 --> 19:37.720]  Yeah, I, I gave, Javier was a great dude who was coming around to our area and I gave him 20 bucks.
[19:37.740 --> 19:39.220]  And I said, man, you've been great today.
[19:39.260 --> 19:39.580]  Thanks.
[19:39.620 --> 19:40.600]  And he said, no problem.
[19:40.660 --> 19:41.700]  And then started bringing me doubles.
[19:42.040 --> 19:47.200]  And that was like, I remember like the first half of the day, pretty good.
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.180]  Second half of the day, a little hazy, a lot of sleeping.
[19:52.120 --> 19:53.540]  We were making some dinner plans.
[19:53.660 --> 19:55.000]  And then your small wife texts the group.
[19:55.100 --> 19:56.360]  I don't think Eric's going to make it.
[19:56.400 --> 19:56.760]  No!
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.620]  You were done for the rest of the day.
[20:00.060 --> 20:02.060]  I was too, in a different way, unfortunately.
[20:02.400 --> 20:03.380]  But yeah.
[20:03.540 --> 20:04.320]  So what was up?
[20:04.340 --> 20:06.980]  Because I was, I was fighting the ocean and tequila.
[20:07.220 --> 20:08.440]  What were you fighting, Jeff?
[20:08.800 --> 20:12.840]  Well, it seems at some point, and I don't, I don't want to pivot too far away from the
[20:12.840 --> 20:14.420]  sunglass saga because I think that's fascinating.
[20:14.520 --> 20:14.960]  We should get into.
[20:14.960 --> 20:22.820]  But at some point, right around the time you passed out from alcohol poisoning, I, I got
[20:22.820 --> 20:26.980]  a little rumble in my tummy, which I was kind of expecting.
[20:27.580 --> 20:32.340]  Unfortunately, when I travel now with the diverticulitis, you know, with my butthole
[20:32.340 --> 20:35.840]  issues, any like change to my routine kind of fucks me up a little bit.
[20:36.040 --> 20:39.600]  And so I always at like some point have like a crampy day I got to deal with and I bring
[20:39.600 --> 20:41.500]  extra Miralax and stuff for it.
[20:41.500 --> 20:44.840]  So I was expecting to have like a, an issue.
[20:45.640 --> 20:47.080]  I wasn't expecting to have this issue.
[20:47.180 --> 20:49.600]  I did not have, I did not have a diverticulitis issue.
[20:49.700 --> 20:54.460]  I had, I suddenly in the water hanging out, beating the shit out of the waves with everybody.
[20:54.540 --> 20:58.180]  I realized I had, I was about to have explosive diarrhea.
[20:58.260 --> 20:58.660]  Oh no!
[20:58.660 --> 21:05.040]  So I ran up to the hotel room and I had a, I had a dumb and dumber-esque shit.
[21:05.500 --> 21:06.360]  Legs straight out.
[21:06.360 --> 21:07.380]  Yeah. Legs straight out.
[21:07.460 --> 21:13.660]  That was followed by, uh, 14 more in the next few hours.
[21:13.860 --> 21:18.920]  I ended up, I got up to shit seven times in the middle of the night that night.
[21:18.980 --> 21:21.980]  Like I, I, I luckily I have an aura ring now.
[21:22.020 --> 21:24.440]  So it tells me it's like, you took a shit at 115.
[21:24.820 --> 21:26.360]  You took a shit at 132.
[21:26.620 --> 21:27.820]  You took a shit at 208.
[21:27.980 --> 21:29.740]  And so I have like the record of it.
[21:30.240 --> 21:31.360]  My stress level is detected.
[21:31.820 --> 21:35.180]  I got Montezuma's revenge, which I've never had before.
[21:35.180 --> 21:40.640]  It kicked in around Saturday afternoon and it didn't end until Tuesday evening.
[21:41.400 --> 21:45.640]  And, uh, I was just, I didn't let it affect the vacation other than Saturday night.
[21:45.720 --> 21:46.420]  I took it easy.
[21:46.700 --> 21:51.020]  I still did all the stuff with you guys, but I just would have to take breaks to just
[21:51.020 --> 21:53.160]  blow chunks out of my asshole for a while.
[21:53.300 --> 21:56.480]  And I was just like, I was like a water hose by Sunday afternoon.
[21:56.720 --> 22:01.060]  I was just like, you just like fucking turn it on and just water the plants with it.
[22:01.560 --> 22:03.160]  It was brutal.
[22:03.320 --> 22:04.660]  And I don't know how I got it.
[22:04.660 --> 22:08.380]  Because, you know, everything I drank was Diet Coke for the most part.
[22:08.500 --> 22:13.820]  I did have a lot of those Virgin Miami vices, which are the non-alcohol version of the drink
[22:13.820 --> 22:14.580]  everybody else was having.
[22:15.340 --> 22:17.120]  And so I don't think that would have done it.
[22:17.140 --> 22:18.200]  And I really didn't eat much.
[22:18.700 --> 22:22.600]  Yeah, but did you brush your teeth and use the faucet one time by accident?
[22:22.980 --> 22:25.180]  Maybe one time by accident.
[22:25.380 --> 22:27.620]  I can't specifically remember one night.
[22:27.760 --> 22:31.100]  Did you maybe take a shower and put a bunch of water in your mouth?
[22:31.200 --> 22:31.400]  Maybe?
[22:31.500 --> 22:34.180]  No, I drank a bunch of salt water from the ocean, unfortunately.
[22:34.180 --> 22:40.080]  And the only other thing is I really over indexed on the Neapolitan ice cream.
[22:40.460 --> 22:41.900]  That was the new stars.
[22:42.640 --> 22:45.940]  Andrew, you would not believe how good the vanilla ice cream is.
[22:45.980 --> 22:49.040]  And I'm a person who considers vanilla ice cream to be the base ice cream.
[22:49.160 --> 22:50.100]  You know, we've talked about this.
[22:50.440 --> 22:52.720]  But this vanilla ice cream was next level.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.140]  And if that's what gave me the shits, it was worth it.
[22:57.700 --> 22:58.220]  That's not true.
[22:58.300 --> 22:58.860]  It wasn't worth it.
[22:58.940 --> 22:59.780]  Nothing was worth it.
[23:00.020 --> 23:02.720]  But yeah, nothing at all was worth it.
[23:02.720 --> 23:07.500]  But it was like I even time I was fucking I was nervous to fly.
[23:07.640 --> 23:11.220]  So I had to, like, take a shit the second before we got on the plane.
[23:11.380 --> 23:13.820]  And then I took a shit the second we got off the plane.
[23:13.820 --> 23:19.320]  But I managed not to blow out the the the bathroom on the plane, which was awesome.
[23:19.600 --> 23:23.800]  Did you just need to on the plane or you having to like mentally manage it?
[23:24.140 --> 23:28.500]  No, I needed to right as they announced we were landing.
[23:28.640 --> 23:32.080]  So when there's about 30 minutes left, I just want to hit me a little bit of hope.
[23:32.080 --> 23:35.920]  And then I was like, as long as we don't taxi too long and you know what I mean?
[23:35.980 --> 23:36.720]  And it was fine.
[23:36.820 --> 23:41.100]  But I like I basically sprinted because then I got off the plane and I realized, oh, fuck,
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.760]  we're an international flight.
[23:42.940 --> 23:45.340]  I have to go through fucking passport control.
[23:45.500 --> 23:50.020]  Oh, no, I never I've never done that in Austin before.
[23:50.280 --> 23:54.100]  You're in an office building for like a football field.
[23:54.540 --> 23:56.020]  There's nothing in there.
[23:56.220 --> 23:57.620]  That is the craziest place.
[23:57.920 --> 24:01.380]  Every time I've done international, you land in like Houston or Dallas and like do it there.
[24:01.380 --> 24:02.680]  Never done that in Austin.
[24:02.860 --> 24:09.100]  You're just inside of the building from severance to like go to show someone your passport.
[24:09.260 --> 24:09.820]  It was crazy.
[24:09.960 --> 24:11.800]  It goes so fast in Austin, too, though.
[24:11.820 --> 24:12.360]  It's so great.
[24:12.540 --> 24:18.060]  I will say the upstairs bathroom before you get down to that is pretty empty, but I wouldn't
[24:18.060 --> 24:20.740]  recommend using it for a while because they're going to need to do some renovations.
[24:22.220 --> 24:23.100]  Oh, man.

[25:07.560 --> 25:09.540]  car park technology to the toilets?
[25:10.260 --> 25:10.360]  What?
[25:10.920 --> 25:11.440]  What?
[25:12.340 --> 25:14.620]  Oh, where it tells you the light that it's open?
[25:15.060 --> 25:16.360]  It's unbelievable.
[25:16.620 --> 25:17.980]  Every box should have this.
[25:18.240 --> 25:19.240]  Yeah, yeah, it's cool.
[25:19.620 --> 25:20.140]  Oh, wow.
[25:20.340 --> 25:21.240]  I completely agree with that.
[25:22.220 --> 25:25.760]  Yeah, I've never seen that in box, but now you don't have to look between the
[25:25.760 --> 25:28.180]  massive cracks in American toilet stores.
[25:28.180 --> 25:31.840]  What is this that you're signed into that you just sent this with?
[25:32.900 --> 25:35.300]  What account is this?
[25:35.620 --> 25:36.020]  Oh, Other Gavy.
[25:36.520 --> 25:40.220]  That's the second account I made so that I can stream my gameplay.
[25:40.900 --> 25:44.120]  I made that for you, you ungrateful bastard.
[25:45.200 --> 25:46.140]  Thank you, thank you, Gavy.
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.260]  Speaking of ungrateful, you know who's not ungrateful?
[25:51.460 --> 25:51.720]  Gavin.
[25:51.860 --> 25:53.240]  He's a true fucking friend.
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.480]  I gotta say, I love Gavin.
[25:57.400 --> 26:04.480]  We were in the water on Saturday, and Gavin and I love to get hit by waves when we're
[26:04.480 --> 26:04.920]  playing around.
[26:05.000 --> 26:05.980]  We invented a game.
[26:07.540 --> 26:09.900]  I want to pitch you guys on something called Hot Dog Olympics.
[26:10.020 --> 26:18.740]  I don't want to get too much sausage talk in this episode because we solicited a response
[26:18.740 --> 26:21.300]  from the audience for last week about whether we should do GTA or whatever.
[26:21.380 --> 26:25.540]  We got a ton of response that was really helpful, and I read all of it.
[26:25.540 --> 26:29.300]  One of the pieces of response that I got that I took to heart was that we talked too much
[26:29.300 --> 26:31.820]  sausage talk in the episode, and they wanted podcast talk.
[26:32.420 --> 26:33.560]  So I don't want to get too deep into that.
[26:33.860 --> 26:39.260]  But we invented a thing called Hot Dog Olympics, and one of them is to hold two hot dogs above
[26:39.260 --> 26:43.300]  your hand, above your head, and try to walk as far out into the ocean as you can before
[26:43.300 --> 26:44.220]  the hot dogs get wet.
[26:44.320 --> 26:46.640]  And we were playing that for a while with air hot dogs.
[26:47.040 --> 26:48.020]  It was fucking awesome.
[26:48.140 --> 26:48.760]  Yeah, we were practicing.
[26:49.060 --> 26:53.980]  We just had empty hands, so we're just holding up just like two grabbed hands above our heads.
[26:53.980 --> 26:56.660]  And having Meg and Emily tell us if the hot dogs would have got wet.
[26:57.940 --> 26:59.300]  It was so much fun.
[26:59.900 --> 27:04.700]  But at some point, Gavin turns around, and he gets whacked by a wave really hard,
[27:04.820 --> 27:06.440]  and his sunglasses go flying.
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.100]  And he's like, oh, my glasses!
[27:08.500 --> 27:11.160]  It was the back of my head, and they just got sucked right off.
[27:11.240 --> 27:12.140]  Like, I didn't even see him.
[27:12.380 --> 27:16.640]  So everybody just starts swimming around looking for Gavin's glasses in the water,
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.300]  and we look for like 10 minutes, and we can't find him.
[27:20.780 --> 27:22.240]  And I thought, that's really disappointing.
[27:22.240 --> 27:25.540]  And Gavin's like, I have other pairs.
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.860]  There's a free pair I got from an endorsement or whatever, probably.
[27:28.360 --> 27:29.700]  And he was like, it's no big deal.
[27:29.740 --> 27:30.640]  I have more sunglasses.
[27:30.880 --> 27:32.400]  And so the next day, he came out with a different pair.
[27:32.740 --> 27:35.340]  And we're hanging out and playing the same dumb games.
[27:35.520 --> 27:39.720]  And Meg turns around, and she gets fucking thwacked with a wave,
[27:39.880 --> 27:41.380]  and her sunglasses go flying.
[27:41.980 --> 27:43.580]  And Meg's like, no, my sunglasses!
[27:43.860 --> 27:45.000]  And we're kind of laughing about it.
[27:45.020 --> 27:46.520]  And she goes, they're prescription!
[27:47.220 --> 27:49.940]  And I was like, no, fuck this ocean.
[27:49.940 --> 27:52.380]  I'm not letting another one of my friend's sunglasses go.
[27:52.520 --> 27:54.720]  And I thought, I bet these things don't...
[27:54.720 --> 27:55.860]  I bet they just sink.
[27:56.020 --> 27:58.540]  So I ran over to where... well, I swam over to where Meg was,
[27:58.660 --> 28:01.120]  and I just started shuffling on the ground with my feet,
[28:01.220 --> 28:03.680]  kind of like in Mario Party Jubilee.
[28:03.980 --> 28:06.080]  You know, the one minigame where you're the stamp,
[28:06.200 --> 28:07.760]  and you're trying to cover as much of the...
[28:09.260 --> 28:10.160]  You know what I'm talking about?
[28:10.220 --> 28:10.820]  The new Mario Party?
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.280]  Yes.
[28:11.860 --> 28:13.260]  Yeah, yeah, Mario Party Jubilee.
[28:13.440 --> 28:13.560]  Yeah.
[28:14.840 --> 28:15.620]  Isn't that what it's called?
[28:17.380 --> 28:17.740]  Jamboree.
[28:18.040 --> 28:18.580]  But it's fine.
[28:18.760 --> 28:19.620]  Jubilee, whatever.
[28:19.620 --> 28:20.620]  Fish and Jubilee.
[28:21.760 --> 28:22.420]  Same shit.
[28:23.220 --> 28:24.240]  Anyway, so like that.
[28:24.440 --> 28:26.220]  And then after like... and everybody starts to do it.
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.320]  And after like 90 seconds, I fucking found it with my toe.
[28:29.840 --> 28:31.200]  And I'm like, holy shit, I think I got it.
[28:31.200 --> 28:32.800]  And I reached down and I pull out Meg's glasses,
[28:32.980 --> 28:35.160]  and we saved her prescription glasses.
[28:35.520 --> 28:36.120]  It was incredible.
[28:36.660 --> 28:37.720]  It was so crazy.
[28:37.940 --> 28:39.180]  It was so crazy.
[28:39.680 --> 28:41.900]  And so I felt like a fucking hero,
[28:41.900 --> 28:44.260]  and I felt like we discovered a tactic
[28:44.260 --> 28:46.440]  that if you lose your glasses in the ocean,
[28:46.600 --> 28:47.800]  they go straight to the bottom.
[28:47.800 --> 28:50.300]  So don't bother looking through the water and stuff.
[28:50.400 --> 28:53.040]  Don't bother looking where they might have been pushed to.
[28:53.140 --> 28:54.760]  Just start shuffling around on the ground.
[28:55.140 --> 28:58.120]  And then like, I don't know, maybe a half hour later,
[28:58.420 --> 29:00.760]  Gavin loses his new sunglasses.
[29:01.200 --> 29:03.740]  And I'm like, no, not again.
[29:03.860 --> 29:05.000]  Now we know how to do this.
[29:05.080 --> 29:07.700]  And so I fucking launch into action.
[29:08.140 --> 29:08.580]  And within...
[29:08.580 --> 29:10.540]  Well, firstly, though, Meg was like,
[29:11.140 --> 29:11.960]  oh, I found it.
[29:12.180 --> 29:13.940]  They flew into my hands.
[29:14.040 --> 29:16.480]  And then she realized that her own ones had fallen off again.
[29:16.480 --> 29:18.260]  She had caught her own.
[29:18.340 --> 29:19.100]  Yeah, that was funny, too.
[29:19.480 --> 29:20.800]  But so I jump over to where Gavin is.
[29:20.960 --> 29:22.820]  And in less than 90 seconds, I found them.
[29:22.980 --> 29:23.580]  They're at my foot.
[29:23.720 --> 29:25.260]  And I'm like, Gavin, I found your glasses right here.
[29:25.320 --> 29:27.060]  But they're like right where a wave is breaking.
[29:27.160 --> 29:29.480]  So it keeps like hammering me and hammering me.
[29:29.620 --> 29:31.280]  And I'm like, Gavin, my foot's on him.
[29:31.540 --> 29:32.400]  Swim down and get it.
[29:32.420 --> 29:34.420]  And he's like trying to look with his hands to get it.
[29:34.460 --> 29:35.300]  And I'm like, he's...
[29:35.300 --> 29:36.700]  I love you being useless.
[29:36.960 --> 29:38.120]  And I'm like, fuck it, I'll get it myself.
[29:38.360 --> 29:39.920]  And so I dive down to go get him.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.100]  And right as I do, I get fucking whacked with another wave.
[29:43.200 --> 29:44.840]  And my glasses go flying.
[29:44.840 --> 29:47.380]  These glasses that Emily and I bought together in London.
[29:47.780 --> 29:49.200]  And I'm like, no, not my glasses.
[29:49.500 --> 29:51.620]  And then I lose Gavin's glasses in the same breath.
[29:51.900 --> 29:54.420]  And then my glasses are fucking gone, gone.
[29:54.560 --> 29:56.140]  And then so we're like looking around again.
[29:56.260 --> 30:00.380]  And then I think Meg or Emily found Gavin's glasses like 30 seconds later.
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.840]  So we ended up with everybody's glasses but mine.
[30:04.220 --> 30:10.700]  I got annoyed because I, you know, I didn't plan on losing my glasses at any point.
[30:10.800 --> 30:12.800]  And I'm able to find everybody else's but my own.
[30:12.860 --> 30:14.220]  And so I'm looking around and looking around.
[30:14.220 --> 30:16.280]  And finally, I do the thing when I get pissed.
[30:16.540 --> 30:18.140]  I'm like, I'm just going to buy my way out of this.
[30:18.500 --> 30:20.100]  So I just walk out of the ocean.
[30:20.340 --> 30:25.740]  I walk back up to my hotel room, get my wallet, take a couple of diarrhea shits,
[30:25.900 --> 30:29.940]  go downstairs to the sunglass store, buy a new pair of sunglasses,
[30:30.160 --> 30:33.160]  go back up to my hotel room, take another diarrhea shit,
[30:33.460 --> 30:35.540]  drop my wallet back off because I don't need it at the beach,
[30:35.580 --> 30:37.380]  come all the way back down to the beach.
[30:37.560 --> 30:40.860]  And as I'm walking up to the beach, Gavin's walking out of the ocean.
[30:40.960 --> 30:43.980]  He's like, would you find your sunglasses?
[30:43.980 --> 30:44.980]  Because I'm wearing new sunglasses.
[30:45.040 --> 30:47.340]  And I go, no, I just went to the I just went to the store and bought them
[30:47.800 --> 30:49.200]  and took eight shits or whatever.
[30:49.480 --> 30:52.760]  Why? Have you been in the water this whole time looking for mine?
[30:52.820 --> 30:55.780]  He was like, well, yeah, he spent probably 30 minutes
[30:55.780 --> 30:57.600]  looking for my sunglasses by himself.
[30:57.700 --> 30:58.700]  I had no idea.
[30:59.240 --> 31:00.200]  I was out there flipping around.
[31:00.500 --> 31:03.380]  I was out there buying sunglasses and taking care of business.
[31:03.620 --> 31:05.380]  And he's such a good friend.
[31:05.440 --> 31:06.860]  He never gave up looking for him.
[31:06.880 --> 31:07.800]  I really appreciated that.
[31:07.940 --> 31:10.860]  Well, I felt bad because it was it was a one for one sacrifice.
[31:10.860 --> 31:14.160]  You lost yours and ended up with mine.
[31:15.020 --> 31:16.660]  I like that you said I was useless, though.
[31:16.700 --> 31:18.440]  You said, I got it.
[31:18.640 --> 31:19.520]  They're on my foot.
[31:19.640 --> 31:21.220]  And I'm like scrambling over.
[31:21.300 --> 31:22.840]  And I'm like, get it, get it.
[31:23.020 --> 31:24.000]  You can't see.
[31:24.080 --> 31:25.420]  I can see where your foot was.
[31:25.500 --> 31:27.840]  So I was like starting at your hip, which I could see.
[31:28.220 --> 31:31.960]  And then you're then you're acting like I didn't also get washed away
[31:31.960 --> 31:33.500]  by the waves that hit you.
[31:33.720 --> 31:36.020]  So I'm like getting flipped upside down as well.
[31:36.140 --> 31:38.640]  Desperate to hang on to your fucking glasses.
[31:38.980 --> 31:40.040]  My big toe.
[31:40.860 --> 31:44.520]  I should have just put my hand on the front of your face to protect yours.
[31:46.720 --> 31:51.400]  Was there any consideration to just not wear sunglasses in this environment
[31:51.400 --> 31:54.560]  after like the seventh time sunglasses went missing?
[31:54.860 --> 31:57.980]  It was so bright, Andrew.
[31:58.280 --> 32:00.160]  It was cloudless.
[32:00.700 --> 32:03.360]  The sea was so blue.
[32:03.940 --> 32:06.840]  Everything reflected into your eyes.
[32:07.100 --> 32:10.500]  I, after getting my ass kicked by the ocean
[32:10.500 --> 32:12.760]  the first time, I'm like, I'm going, I'm going back out there later,
[32:12.780 --> 32:14.740]  like the next day with no sunglasses.
[32:14.740 --> 32:18.140]  I got ankle deep and I went, fuck that.
[32:18.240 --> 32:18.960]  And I turned back around.
[32:19.060 --> 32:19.660]  I got my sunglasses.
[32:19.920 --> 32:20.700]  It's so bright.
[32:21.280 --> 32:21.600]  Makes total sense.
[32:21.660 --> 32:24.020]  I figured it was as much, but it just it had to be asked
[32:24.020 --> 32:26.140]  after this has happened eight times in a row.
[32:26.480 --> 32:28.340]  I mean, you can sunburn your eyes,
[32:28.820 --> 32:30.260]  but I don't think you're allowed to put sunscreen in.
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:32.080 --> 32:33.320]  It's illegal, actually, to do that.
[32:33.780 --> 32:39.080]  It was it was pretty impressive to see like the ocean be conquered
[32:39.080 --> 32:44.040]  and then get its wind back so quickly with like all this stuff.
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.740]  Like you try to go against Poseidon.
[32:46.060 --> 32:47.900]  Yeah, the ocean stays undefeated, dude.
[32:48.120 --> 32:49.680]  Yeah, undefeated since forever.
[32:50.180 --> 32:53.600]  The sun kind of started behind the ocean in perspective to where we were.
[32:53.780 --> 32:56.680]  And as the sun moves over and gets behind us,
[32:57.060 --> 32:59.200]  the ocean just goes like super blue mode.
[32:59.320 --> 33:01.480]  And in my opinion, that was the time to get in there.
[33:01.720 --> 33:02.680]  Like full blue.
[33:02.860 --> 33:03.280]  Sounds nice.
[33:03.600 --> 33:05.500]  It was it looked fucking fake.
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.000]  Like Meg said, it looked cel shaded.
[33:07.120 --> 33:07.760]  And she was right.
[33:07.800 --> 33:08.400]  It really is.
[33:08.400 --> 33:09.980]  You look at like you play Sea of Thieves and you're like,
[33:10.160 --> 33:11.440]  I wish the water looked like this.
[33:11.520 --> 33:12.380]  Apparently it does.
[33:12.840 --> 33:13.520]  Yeah, it was.
[33:13.720 --> 33:14.900]  It's the best it's ever looked.
[33:14.940 --> 33:17.100]  I think you pointed out last time, like when we went before,
[33:17.220 --> 33:20.620]  it was there was like some seaweed and stuff like that.
[33:20.760 --> 33:23.580]  What this was like the most pristine ocean I think I've ever.
[33:23.640 --> 33:26.620]  I mean, I grew up around the ocean and this was like gorgeous
[33:26.620 --> 33:28.000]  compared to any ocean I've ever seen.
[33:28.140 --> 33:28.960]  It was incredible.
[33:29.420 --> 33:30.760]  And pictures don't even do it justice.
[33:30.860 --> 33:33.720]  Like it was blue in this picture, but the camera tries to like white
[33:33.720 --> 33:36.160]  balance off some of the blue by like adding yellow.
[33:36.500 --> 33:37.540]  It was bluer than that.
[33:37.540 --> 33:37.820]  Yeah.
[33:38.600 --> 33:41.420]  And like so see through like you could just see to the bottom.
[33:41.600 --> 33:42.960]  And so it was it was really, really cool.
[33:43.100 --> 33:43.480]  It was great.
[33:43.520 --> 33:45.500]  And then bunch of food.
[33:45.660 --> 33:47.940]  We just kept eating and hanging out.
[33:48.060 --> 33:51.100]  We went to the alien sports bar again.
[33:51.340 --> 33:52.200]  It was great.
[33:52.520 --> 33:53.980]  Showed Gavin the dartboard.
[33:54.220 --> 33:55.380]  Really great stuff.
[33:56.240 --> 33:58.300]  Eric, what game did what game was that we watched?
[33:58.360 --> 33:59.580]  That was Eagles Packers, right?
[33:59.840 --> 34:00.180]  Yeah.
[34:00.380 --> 34:00.700]  Yes.
[34:00.860 --> 34:05.780]  Dude, Eric and I sat down together, just the two of us to watch the Eagles Packers game
[34:05.780 --> 34:09.440]  in this room, in this alien sport bar.
[34:10.040 --> 34:13.820]  And it was one of the funniest experiences I've ever had because the sports bar was split
[34:13.820 --> 34:14.720]  into two groups.
[34:14.780 --> 34:18.740]  There was the Packers group in one room and the Eagles group in another behind us.
[34:18.900 --> 34:27.300]  And for some reason, our TV was about a minute and five seconds behind every other TV in
[34:27.300 --> 34:27.880]  the building.
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.180]  But it was the only place for us to sit.
[34:30.540 --> 34:33.980]  So we would be waiting for we'd just be waiting during a dead play or whatever.
[34:33.980 --> 34:38.680]  And then suddenly all the Packers fans would be screaming and hooping for joy.
[34:38.820 --> 34:40.980]  And we'd be like, oh, well, something's going to happen positive for them.
[34:41.000 --> 34:41.540]  Oh, there you go.
[34:41.560 --> 34:42.220]  They got a first down.
[34:42.500 --> 34:46.820]  And so we got like, we could determine what was going to happen ahead of time based on
[34:46.820 --> 34:48.160]  who was screaming in the place.
[34:48.220 --> 34:50.940]  And it was a really funny way to watch a football game.
[34:51.360 --> 34:55.360]  It was the most unique way I've ever watched a football game that I didn't care about
[34:55.360 --> 34:58.360]  because it made me go, I think this might be the way to do it.
[34:58.380 --> 35:01.080]  Like, divide the room behind you.
[35:01.080 --> 35:05.580]  Let them be a minute ahead and then just go, oh, I'm excited for what they just yelled
[35:05.580 --> 35:05.880]  for.
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.280]  And you just keep sitting and waiting.
[35:07.520 --> 35:08.560]  It's so cool.
[35:08.980 --> 35:10.620]  Gavin sent me a football text.
[35:10.920 --> 35:13.980]  And I was curious if you two were part what?
[35:15.420 --> 35:21.380]  Gavin sent me what I described as the worst take I think you'll have all year.
[35:21.500 --> 35:22.480]  It made no sense.
[35:22.840 --> 35:24.220]  It was related to football.
[35:25.060 --> 35:29.660]  I wonder if the others could guess what my suggestion for an improvement to the sport
[35:29.660 --> 35:30.240]  would be.
[35:30.240 --> 35:31.600]  There's no way they can.
[35:31.780 --> 35:31.960]  Okay.
[35:32.400 --> 35:33.800]  How are you going to even set it up?
[35:34.540 --> 35:36.020]  Clock doesn't stop.
[35:36.260 --> 35:36.560]  Yeah.
[35:36.960 --> 35:37.320]  No.
[35:38.300 --> 35:39.360]  It's related to...
[35:40.240 --> 35:45.080]  Okay, so sometimes, you know, if there's like an interception or something and the
[35:45.080 --> 35:48.980]  guy just starts cooking in the other direction, everyone's behind him.
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.180]  Not, I mean, like, it really depends.
[35:52.380 --> 35:56.440]  But for the sake of whatever Gavin's going to say, absolutely, absolutely, dude.
[35:56.440 --> 35:57.060]  I agree.
[35:57.160 --> 35:57.980]  They are behind him.
[35:57.980 --> 36:01.900]  Well, sometimes he's just completely uncontested.
[36:03.220 --> 36:05.920]  So you think there should be a goalie?
[36:07.820 --> 36:09.800]  Is that is that what you're getting?
[36:09.880 --> 36:11.360]  You think there should be a goalie?
[36:11.540 --> 36:13.760]  Gavin texted me 7.57 p.m.
[36:13.800 --> 36:16.720]  I figured out the problem with American football.
[36:17.080 --> 36:18.380]  No goalkeepers.
[36:19.920 --> 36:24.480]  I saw that and replied insane take 11 on every play.
[36:24.480 --> 36:28.400]  It's the entire one of the teams is all goalkeepers.
[36:28.680 --> 36:32.600]  Their entire function is to prevent goals of any kind.
[36:33.140 --> 36:33.880]  Well, why is it?
[36:34.060 --> 36:34.500]  Wait, what?
[36:34.980 --> 36:35.540]  What?
[36:35.720 --> 36:37.900]  Because there's an offense and there's a defense.
[36:38.220 --> 36:40.960]  We're in soccer or football, your football.
[36:41.160 --> 36:43.760]  It's fluid when you're on offense and defense.
[36:43.760 --> 36:46.340]  And it's the same people in the same roles.
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.920]  Say your team is attacking going one way, right?
[36:49.260 --> 36:49.460]  Right.
[36:49.740 --> 36:53.620]  Have a guy that just stays all the way back on your goal line.
[36:53.620 --> 36:54.500]  They do.
[36:54.620 --> 36:55.500]  It's called the free safety.
[36:56.280 --> 36:56.460]  No.
[36:56.760 --> 36:58.160]  OK, I now understand what he's saying.
[36:58.440 --> 37:00.820]  He thinks that there should be an offensive goalkeeper.
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.800]  So when it flips around and the guy just starts booking his asshole all the way
[37:06.800 --> 37:09.840]  and there's no one in front of him, all he has to do is outrun behind him.
[37:10.060 --> 37:13.680]  If there was one goalkeeper that he had to deal with at the last second,
[37:13.740 --> 37:14.580]  I think that'd be phenomenal.
[37:14.880 --> 37:16.440]  Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and agree.
[37:16.540 --> 37:18.020]  I'm going to go ahead and agree with Gavin.
[37:18.260 --> 37:20.200]  I think there should be an offensive goalkeeper also.
[37:20.360 --> 37:20.760]  I agree.
[37:20.940 --> 37:21.260]  Yeah.
[37:21.260 --> 37:27.760]  Upon further understanding this, I assume that he got this take between you guys.
[37:27.920 --> 37:30.740]  And then when I said, this is a wild take by you,
[37:30.820 --> 37:34.680]  and then he just never replied, which then made me think, did he come up with this?
[37:35.120 --> 37:38.160]  Does he not have the knowledge to?
[37:38.860 --> 37:42.080]  No, I just I'm always scared of getting into content off of podcasts.
[37:44.060 --> 37:47.160]  I actually I think I think everybody agrees with your idea, Gavin.
[37:47.620 --> 37:49.360]  I think we should try it for one season.
[37:49.400 --> 37:50.500]  Yeah, one described that way.
[37:50.500 --> 37:51.480]  I think that's really fun.
[37:51.640 --> 37:52.420]  Yeah, I like that.
[37:52.860 --> 37:55.320]  I actually had a note while we're on the subject of improving sports.
[37:55.460 --> 37:57.540]  You know, I'm a I'm a big time hockey fan now,
[37:57.580 --> 37:59.240]  big as big a hockey fan is Andrew even.
[38:00.280 --> 38:03.140]  And Noah backwards and forwards and all the stuff.
[38:04.340 --> 38:06.280]  I had an idea on how to improve hockey.
[38:06.660 --> 38:06.900]  OK.
[38:07.320 --> 38:07.900]  Two pucks.
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.920]  Oh, I'm so in.
[38:11.140 --> 38:12.200]  Oh, my God.
[38:12.840 --> 38:13.200]  Multipuck is fun.
[38:13.340 --> 38:14.180]  Yes, baby.
[38:14.760 --> 38:15.160]  Multipuck.
[38:15.640 --> 38:18.140]  All I can think of every time I watch hockey is, man,
[38:18.140 --> 38:20.920]  imagine if you had to split your focus between two pucks at once.
[38:21.040 --> 38:22.580]  That would heighten the tension.
[38:23.040 --> 38:23.500]  That's awesome.
[38:23.900 --> 38:27.200]  I would love I would love a hockey if it was streamed on Twitch.
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.040]  And it was like, you know, when you get knocked out of party animals
[38:31.040 --> 38:32.620]  and you get to throw the occasional bomb.
[38:33.080 --> 38:39.740]  Yeah, if the if Twitch could just like vote on what goes in like a second puck,
[38:39.980 --> 38:40.660]  be phenomenal.
[38:40.900 --> 38:46.420]  I think that if you go to the penalty box, one point per game,
[38:46.420 --> 38:49.800]  somebody in that penalty box can throw the multipuck in.
[38:50.120 --> 38:50.880]  And now you just have to.
[38:51.160 --> 38:56.040]  Oh, so now it's like it's it's not like there's a like there is a benefit to the penalty.
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.040]  So you like want to get in there, but you don't want to get in there too soon
[38:59.040 --> 39:01.480]  unless you really want that multipuck early.
[39:02.080 --> 39:08.380]  And what if in the penalty box under your seat, there's an electric shock that can be
[39:08.380 --> 39:10.880]  controlled by the other penalty box and vice versa?
[39:10.880 --> 39:15.240]  And there's a button you can push to shock them, but they can push a button to shock you.
[39:15.240 --> 39:17.680]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[39:18.160 --> 39:21.120]  Every sport is improved with a multiball functionality.
[39:21.680 --> 39:25.700]  I can't think of a single one where it'd be less fun to have a moment in which there
[39:25.700 --> 39:27.280]  are two balls in place simultaneously.
[39:27.640 --> 39:30.420]  Could you imagine if a quarterback had a holster and he had a ball in each?
[39:30.660 --> 39:30.680]  Yeah.
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.220]  And he fucking throws the first ball and he pulls out and throws the second.
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.880]  What totally changed the way that like we view quarterbacks where it's like,
[39:38.940 --> 39:40.700]  oh, you can like scramble, like get out of the pocket.
[39:40.820 --> 39:42.720]  Right. But how does he throw that second football?
[39:43.280 --> 39:46.200]  What does the defense do at a double handoff?
[39:46.420 --> 39:49.000]  Two guys going other directions as fast as they can.
[39:49.340 --> 39:49.420]  Wow.
[39:49.560 --> 39:49.700]  Wow.
[39:49.780 --> 39:50.960]  Double handoff.
[39:51.260 --> 39:51.820]  You know what else?
[39:52.060 --> 39:59.420]  If you're like, say, a running back and you get handed off both balls and you score with
[39:59.420 --> 40:03.120]  double footballs, that should count as two touchdowns, right?
[40:04.580 --> 40:05.560]  Like that's a double score.
[40:06.040 --> 40:07.040]  Yeah, absolutely should.
[40:07.420 --> 40:07.840]  Absolutely.
[40:08.320 --> 40:12.320]  The XFL had a really dumb rule when they brought it back where if you're on defense
[40:12.320 --> 40:17.920]  and you like recovered a fumble, you got to keep the other team's ball that had their logo on it,
[40:17.920 --> 40:22.360]  which I thought was like fun, dumb, but it really could have been amazing if it was like
[40:22.360 --> 40:24.660]  if the other team ran out of balls, you just won.
[40:24.980 --> 40:27.200]  Like every team had like four footballs.
[40:27.200 --> 40:31.860]  And if you intercepted or like recovered all four, the game just ended with you in it.
[40:31.860 --> 40:32.400]  That's awesome.
[40:32.760 --> 40:33.440]  It's like halfway.
[40:33.600 --> 40:35.180]  They're halfway there with a great rule.
[40:35.580 --> 40:36.420]  How weird.
[40:36.420 --> 40:40.340]  That's like weird, like difficult to explain.
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.440]  But also, I think I understand like immediately.
[40:43.960 --> 40:48.060]  That's like the offense always had their own team logo on the ball.
[40:48.120 --> 40:49.780]  So you got to keep it as like a trophy.
[40:50.100 --> 40:51.360]  And that's all it was.
[40:51.480 --> 40:53.600]  But I like the idea of they only have like five.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.660]  And if you get all five, it's over.
[40:57.540 --> 41:00.880]  Nothing says poverty franchise like we only brought five balls.
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.220]  Because there's not really a mechanism in sport where like you have to stop playing
[41:08.220 --> 41:09.160]  because you're out of equipment.
[41:09.320 --> 41:12.680]  No, yeah, that's sort of like they're like billion dollar industries.
[41:12.700 --> 41:15.860]  So I think it would be really crazy if they just went, well, we're out of bats.
[41:15.940 --> 41:17.220]  We can't bat anymore.
[41:17.220 --> 41:18.720]  We don't have like seven home runs.
[41:18.780 --> 41:19.680]  We're out of balls.
[41:19.980 --> 41:21.120]  We must have happened.
[41:21.660 --> 41:22.720]  It must have happened once.
[41:23.300 --> 41:24.020]  Oh, definitely.
[41:24.220 --> 41:30.620]  In like the 50s or something like the you just know the NFL when it started back when it was
[41:30.620 --> 41:35.040]  the NFL and the AFL, like before they merged, it was just like, well,
[41:35.740 --> 41:37.360]  the Cincinnati Bengals couldn't play today.
[41:37.440 --> 41:39.020]  They only had one ball and then they popped it.
[41:39.600 --> 41:40.860]  They're like, get on the loudspeaker.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.660]  Does anyone in the crowd have a football on them we could borrow?
[41:45.480 --> 41:47.580]  We will give it back at the end of the game.
[41:47.880 --> 41:52.280]  In our lifetime, like I think, Jeff, I think you've seen it a little bit more.
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.700]  But in our lifetime, we've seen like sports in the U.S. get so big and like so expensive.
[41:56.700 --> 42:04.420]  But there was a time where it was just like some guys doing this,
[42:04.420 --> 42:09.180]  and then they would get done with the game and go back to work at the grocery store or the bar.
[42:09.400 --> 42:10.540]  And that was just it.
[42:10.600 --> 42:12.260]  Like, that was just what sport was.
[42:12.740 --> 42:16.800]  Yeah, until the late 70s, early 80s, even probably in a lot of sports.
[42:16.940 --> 42:17.680]  Yeah, definitely.
[42:17.880 --> 42:18.260]  It's crazy.
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.140]  Do you think we could potentially do a draft that was sports improvements draft?
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.840]  That's so good.
[42:25.140 --> 42:25.960]  That's interesting.
[42:26.180 --> 42:26.440]  That's so good.
[42:26.440 --> 42:27.400]  I'll put it on the list.
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.520]  I'll put it on the list of ideas.
[42:28.720 --> 42:28.980]  Yeah, maybe.
[42:29.100 --> 42:30.240]  Putting it on the list of ideas!
[42:30.620 --> 42:33.540]  Speaking of, well, I don't want to get into Sasha's talk territory,
[42:33.680 --> 42:35.860]  but there is one draft I wanted to pitch.
[42:36.400 --> 42:37.780]  Eric, or Eric, you know it.
[42:37.840 --> 42:38.340]  Gavin, you know it.
[42:38.420 --> 42:43.180]  But Andrew and Nick that I came up with the other day that we've been kind of mulling around.
[42:43.980 --> 42:48.020]  I was thinking it would be cool to do a, it's like a two-part draft.
[42:48.740 --> 42:54.780]  The first part is everybody has to draft four movies from their birth year.
[42:55.300 --> 42:55.560]  Okay.
[42:56.020 --> 42:59.740]  So we all pick the four coolest movies from our birth year.
[42:59.860 --> 43:00.880]  We've looked at yours, Andrew.
[43:01.000 --> 43:01.940]  They're very good.
[43:02.340 --> 43:03.740]  You have some options that are pretty cool.
[43:04.620 --> 43:07.880]  And then we do that draft and, you know, snake draft style.
[43:07.980 --> 43:10.940]  And then at the end, then we take all those movies and we have to rank them
[43:10.940 --> 43:12.580]  and see where we think they go from best to worst.
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.980]  I love this idea so much.
[43:15.460 --> 43:16.520]  I think it's so good.
[43:16.940 --> 43:17.920]  I think it's so, so good.
[43:18.080 --> 43:18.880]  I just put it in the bank.
[43:18.980 --> 43:19.660]  I think it's fantastic.
[43:19.960 --> 43:21.620]  So would that be our first draft ranker?
[43:22.060 --> 43:23.000]  Yeah, how would the draft work?
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.380]  Is it just us declaring what will be on the list?
[43:27.240 --> 43:27.460]  Yeah.
[43:28.380 --> 43:29.760]  Like every other draft we've done?
[43:31.080 --> 43:32.240]  I didn't understand.
[43:34.560 --> 43:36.840]  Because we can't snipe each other's picks.
[43:37.280 --> 43:38.920]  Yeah, that's essentially what I'm saying.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.720]  We all are just going to have what we have.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.060]  Yeah, but it's very rare that we ever snipe each other's picks.
[43:44.600 --> 43:45.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:45.080 --> 43:46.720]  You're not really playing for the draft part.
[43:46.800 --> 43:48.340]  You're playing for the ranking part, right?
[43:48.700 --> 43:50.560]  Because you're trying to get your four best,
[43:50.620 --> 43:52.500]  or the four that you think are going to rank the best.
[43:52.500 --> 43:55.000]  And so you're drafting for the ranking.
[43:55.300 --> 43:56.700]  I think you've got the potential to win.
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.160]  But I also think you have the potential for the biggest fumble of this.
[44:00.660 --> 44:00.920]  I agree.
[44:01.180 --> 44:01.520]  Really?
[44:01.840 --> 44:02.680]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[44:02.820 --> 44:03.400]  You? Yes.
[44:03.780 --> 44:08.100]  And I think I probably should have the highest ranked movie in the draft, but we'll see.
[44:08.700 --> 44:09.340]  We'll see.
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.260]  I was worried briefly that I was born the same year as Nick, but apparently Nick's an 87.
[44:14.840 --> 44:15.460]  Okay, good.
[44:16.760 --> 44:17.800]  Surviving the game.
[44:18.000 --> 44:18.960]  I know what I'm going with.
[44:19.320 --> 44:22.100]  That sounded like you just told Nick when he was born and he was like,
[44:22.100 --> 44:22.740]  Oh, I am.
[44:22.860 --> 44:24.980]  Okay, thanks for letting me know.
[44:24.980 --> 44:28.460]  I was worried Gavin shared the same year as well.
[44:28.940 --> 44:31.660]  Yeah, Nick's been a big Nick's been like a real guy lately.
[44:31.800 --> 44:35.120]  Nick's been a real Nick's been a real character and we're just
[44:36.740 --> 44:38.320]  Hey, we want to record this thing.
[44:38.440 --> 44:39.360]  I have to pick up my car.
[44:39.540 --> 44:40.400]  I okay.
[44:40.580 --> 44:41.000]  All right.
[44:41.040 --> 44:43.720]  Well, the hardest guy to get pinned down.
[44:43.780 --> 44:44.360]  I don't know, man.
[44:44.440 --> 44:48.000]  I think Nick is secretly the busiest person of the whole group.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.460]  Yes, yes, I agree.
[44:49.660 --> 44:50.740]  I don't know if it's a secret.
[44:50.740 --> 44:54.820]  He's the only one of us with a toddler that instantly makes him busier.
[44:55.160 --> 44:57.960]  Yeah, but didn't you have a toddler when you worked at work?
[44:58.520 --> 44:58.820]  Yes.
[45:00.180 --> 45:02.500]  Didn't I have a toddler when I worked at work?
[45:02.760 --> 45:03.380]  No, Nick.
[45:03.940 --> 45:04.220]  Oh.
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.200]  Yeah, but he's more active now and I have to do I have to take him places to do shit.
[45:10.560 --> 45:11.780]  I'm going to delete that.
[45:11.880 --> 45:12.740]  You put in Eric.
[45:12.880 --> 45:14.180]  This is it was already in above it.
[45:14.880 --> 45:15.620]  Oh, okay, great.
[45:16.080 --> 45:17.520]  Oh, what was the other one that we had?
[45:18.080 --> 45:20.680]  We added Wheel of Decades.
[45:20.740 --> 45:21.120]  Okay.
[45:21.260 --> 45:22.240]  Berthier movie draft.
[45:22.400 --> 45:25.280]  Are we Nostradamus and sports improvement draft.
[45:26.120 --> 45:27.160]  These are good.
[45:27.240 --> 45:28.760]  We'll talk about all these thoughts of shock or whatever.
[45:28.900 --> 45:30.140]  We want to pitch these ideas later.
[45:30.220 --> 45:33.220]  But like, are we Nostradamus was such a fun.
[45:33.340 --> 45:35.060]  I just like that name so much.
[45:35.080 --> 45:35.420]  It's great.
[45:35.540 --> 45:36.480]  We got to do that soon.
[45:37.260 --> 45:39.060]  I just watched Interview with the Vampire.
[45:39.140 --> 45:40.080]  It's a 94 film.
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.980]  What a like disappointing watch current day to thrilling at the time.
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.820]  Because that that film ends in a way of like, shit's going to go down.
[45:50.980 --> 45:52.160]  We're going to make more movies.
[45:52.260 --> 45:54.400]  And then just knowing none of that happens.
[45:54.700 --> 45:58.020]  It is such a disappointing end to that that movie.
[45:59.140 --> 46:03.000]  Like the whole point of the ending is like, oh, man, that was really unsatisfying.
[46:03.080 --> 46:04.800]  And it's like, yeah, that's how life is sometimes.
[46:05.180 --> 46:07.580]  And then they set up like what the next act will be.
[46:07.800 --> 46:11.560]  And then none of those people came back to follow through on that story.
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.440]  It kind of took the air out of the whole Anne Rice mystique at the time,
[46:15.440 --> 46:18.940]  because she was really fucking big at the time.
[46:19.020 --> 46:21.600]  Interview with the Vampire, Vampire Lestat, all that stuff.
[46:21.700 --> 46:25.540]  That was very much like like the grown up version of Harry Potter for that era.
[46:25.640 --> 46:27.800]  And everybody was loving it and her.
[46:28.060 --> 46:29.760]  And then that movie came out and was kind of a dud.
[46:29.800 --> 46:31.940]  And then that was pretty much it.
[46:32.320 --> 46:35.980]  It felt like it could have been like an alternate universe exists
[46:35.980 --> 46:38.280]  where that is the twilight of that time.
[46:38.560 --> 46:41.240]  It was just like the actors in it were too popular.
[46:41.440 --> 46:43.940]  So there's no need for them to be in seven of these.
[46:43.940 --> 46:45.980]  But they could have.
[46:46.140 --> 46:47.980]  There's a world in which we got seven of these.
[46:48.140 --> 46:50.240]  And what a weird time that would have been.
[46:50.500 --> 46:52.860]  It was also honestly a much better book than a movie.
[46:52.960 --> 46:54.480]  They didn't do a great job with the film.
[46:54.660 --> 46:57.940]  Anyway, like from casting on it, they really did.
[46:58.000 --> 46:58.540]  I could see that.
[46:58.680 --> 47:00.100]  Not going to the part of that fucking movie.
[47:00.340 --> 47:01.320]  Oh, it's not going to be on my list.
[47:01.420 --> 47:04.380]  How do you fuck up Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise at the height of their career?
[47:04.800 --> 47:06.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:06.840 --> 47:08.320]  Was Meet Joe Black a good movie?
[47:08.720 --> 47:09.460]  Never saw it.
[47:09.460 --> 47:15.060]  You say there's the funny part in it where Brad Pitt speaks Patois.
[47:16.840 --> 47:19.140]  He's like, oh, I'm not.
[47:19.240 --> 47:20.280]  I was about to do it.
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.300]  I'm not going to do it.
[47:21.400 --> 47:31.040]  But he starts speaking Patois to a woman in a hospital where he sounds like Chet Hanks,
[47:31.920 --> 47:33.860]  you know, just doing like a Jamaican accent.
[47:34.100 --> 47:35.140]  It's very strange.
[47:35.140 --> 47:39.680]  I've only seen that clip because she can like see who he really is, right?
[47:39.820 --> 47:43.240]  And that and just getting hit by two cars.
[47:43.400 --> 47:44.040]  That's the only thing.
[47:44.080 --> 47:46.300]  Yes. Oh, it's so cool.
[47:46.520 --> 47:47.380]  Have you seen that, Andrew?
[47:47.660 --> 47:48.000]  Yes.
[47:48.220 --> 47:48.900]  It's so cool.
[47:49.080 --> 47:49.500]  It's awesome.
[47:49.560 --> 47:50.040]  It's so crazy.
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.360]  Half of Meet Joe Black.
[47:51.800 --> 47:56.140]  We had a moment on the Slack while we were in Mexico where for some reason,
[47:56.200 --> 47:57.740]  Andrew was posting a flag.
[47:58.300 --> 47:59.820]  I think it was the UAE flag or something.
[48:01.320 --> 48:02.360]  Yeah, I don't know.
[48:02.360 --> 48:03.320]  I didn't know what flag it was.
[48:03.820 --> 48:05.240]  We were trying to figure out what flag it was.
[48:05.320 --> 48:08.660]  And then eventually we got onto like someone guessed Chad.
[48:09.320 --> 48:11.680]  And then we looked at the flag of Chad and it wasn't that.
[48:12.140 --> 48:14.240]  And then I thought, oh, I know I'm going to change.
[48:15.140 --> 48:21.320]  I'm going to change my contact for Chad James to the flag of Chad and James.
[48:21.820 --> 48:24.880]  And Chad James used to work at Screw Attack and all that stuff.
[48:25.580 --> 48:29.360]  And then I was like, oh, I'm excited to get a text from Chad now.
[48:29.480 --> 48:32.280]  And then Eric was like, how often does Chad text you?
[48:32.280 --> 48:34.140]  I was like, oh, I don't know.
[48:34.200 --> 48:35.080]  Let me let me search.
[48:35.200 --> 48:36.580]  And I searched my messages for Chad.
[48:37.320 --> 48:40.440]  Nothing came up because I changed him to the flag.
[48:40.580 --> 48:42.300]  You can't search for him.
[48:42.660 --> 48:44.500]  You can't type Chad.
[48:45.060 --> 48:46.700]  You got rid of his name.
[48:47.200 --> 48:48.300]  He's a symbol now.
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.140]  It was it screwed me over within like 20 seconds of me doing it.
[48:52.180 --> 48:53.220]  I was like, oh, good question.
[48:53.300 --> 48:54.500]  Let me, oh, I don't know.
[48:57.680 --> 48:59.440]  But that's how he's in my phone now.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.520]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[49:03.880 --> 49:06.760]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[49:06.940 --> 49:10.460]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[49:10.800 --> 49:12.320]  Available for a limited time.
[49:12.580 --> 49:14.600]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[49:15.680 --> 49:18.380]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[49:18.660 --> 49:22.040]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[49:22.440 --> 49:24.260]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[49:24.460 --> 49:27.680]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[49:27.680 --> 49:32.140]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[49:32.380 --> 49:35.880]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[49:36.220 --> 49:38.140]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[49:41.300 --> 49:42.160]  Oh my god.
[49:42.180 --> 49:43.000]  I have a question for you, Gavin.
[49:43.320 --> 49:43.520]  Yeah.
[49:43.660 --> 49:44.760]  I was thinking about this.
[49:45.600 --> 49:47.340]  Have you, you've played some Sea of Thieves, right?
[49:47.620 --> 49:50.160]  And you've, you know how like the health works,
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.280]  or like you have a health bar and if you eat meat, you get a second health bar.
[49:54.500 --> 49:54.840]  Oh, okay.
[49:54.840 --> 49:56.060]  Like you can get an additional bar.
[49:56.940 --> 50:00.960]  If real life worked that way, if you could just accumulate, like imagine
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.980]  like life was a survival game where you have your sleep and you have your water
[50:04.980 --> 50:10.280]  and you have your food and you could just accumulate bars that slowly depleted
[50:10.760 --> 50:12.120]  as they naturally would.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.180]  Would you spend like, would you take two months of the year off
[50:16.180 --> 50:20.120]  to just get all your eating done and all your sleeping and drinking for the year?
[50:20.300 --> 50:25.240]  No, if I could eat like a golden apple equivalent, I would not eat for two months.
[50:26.340 --> 50:27.220]  Crazy, crazy.
[50:27.420 --> 50:32.000]  Now, in a scenario in which it's not like, there's not like a calorie issue,
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.680]  like everything is healthy, everything is good.
[50:34.700 --> 50:39.380]  You're just like essentially just ingesting your calories now to be distributed
[50:39.840 --> 50:41.120]  across that time period.
[50:41.160 --> 50:43.620]  It's kind of like a bear getting ready for...
[50:43.620 --> 50:44.780]  Sure, like hibernation. Yeah.
[50:44.940 --> 50:49.660]  You're like front loading that work so that you can just focus on slow-mo guys, I guess.
[50:50.200 --> 50:50.600]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[50:50.600 --> 50:53.280]  So if you could, you would opt out of eating like day to day?
[50:53.280 --> 50:57.120]  I would opt out of, I mean, I would probably still eat a social dinner.
[50:58.780 --> 51:01.540]  Does a bear... what is hibernation?
[51:02.960 --> 51:04.700]  It's not what you think it is, I think.
[51:04.960 --> 51:07.600]  I thought they were just having like a three month kip,
[51:07.820 --> 51:09.880]  but apparently they're like awake and stuff.
[51:10.440 --> 51:10.840]  Yes.
[51:11.860 --> 51:13.320]  I don't know what they're doing.
[51:15.380 --> 51:16.260]  There's something...
[51:16.260 --> 51:19.460]  They're like half awake, half asleep, just hanging out, losing weight.
[51:19.460 --> 51:25.000]  Are they in like a different state to being awake and asleep?
[51:25.220 --> 51:26.280]  Is it like a middle ground?
[51:26.780 --> 51:28.340]  Yeah, I think it's a middle thing.
[51:28.560 --> 51:32.040]  I think it's just like it's a lot of sleep where like they lower their
[51:32.800 --> 51:34.220]  heart rate and metabolism.
[51:34.600 --> 51:35.500]  But I kind of want to go back.
[51:35.580 --> 51:37.380]  What's a kip? Is a kip a nap?
[51:37.740 --> 51:38.680]  Yeah, I think it's a nap.
[51:38.820 --> 51:39.360]  Yeah, sleep.
[51:39.660 --> 51:40.820]  I don't think I've ever heard that.
[51:40.920 --> 51:43.280]  I heard Nick say kip and I felt the same way.
[51:43.360 --> 51:44.600]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever heard that.
[51:44.900 --> 51:46.380]  It just kind of threw me also.
[51:46.380 --> 51:50.540]  I wonder if I can find me saying kip in an episode of this podcast.
[51:50.640 --> 51:51.640]  I bet you can.
[51:51.800 --> 51:52.380]  But probably.
[51:52.580 --> 51:54.260]  I think you've talked about the golden apple thing before.
[51:54.420 --> 51:55.060]  So yeah, probably.
[51:55.640 --> 51:59.040]  Isn't there like a certain type of squirrel that like actually hibernates
[51:59.580 --> 52:04.180]  and they have an extremely high alcohol tolerance because their berries ferment?
[52:04.620 --> 52:08.020]  And then so they come out and they like eat the berries and then other animals
[52:08.020 --> 52:10.200]  eat them and get fucked up off of them.
[52:10.480 --> 52:14.360]  And then they die like they get other animals drunk by being ingested by the animals.
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.200]  So the squirrel is basically a bottle of vodka for other animals.
[52:18.680 --> 52:21.020]  Yes, it's like, oh, what is it?
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.240]  It's like a rodent of some kind.
[52:22.300 --> 52:23.180]  They're tiny little guys.
[52:23.280 --> 52:26.620]  You wouldn't expect them to have an insanely high alcohol content.
[52:26.860 --> 52:28.480]  Oh, and they get drunk from eating the squirrel.
[52:29.060 --> 52:29.340]  Yes.
[52:29.440 --> 52:31.680]  So the squirrel eats it is unfazed by it.
[52:31.880 --> 52:37.000]  Then like a wolf eats the squirrel and then the squirrel gets drunk off of the squirrel
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.540]  and it fucks them up.
[52:38.640 --> 52:41.340]  Wait, the squirrel gets drunk off the squirrel?
[52:41.700 --> 52:42.420]  No, the wolf.
[52:42.420 --> 52:48.240]  The wolf eats the squirrel and the squirrel dies in the wolf and the wolf gets drunk from the squirrel.
[52:48.520 --> 52:48.720]  The squirrel dies.
[52:48.820 --> 52:49.000]  Yeah.
[52:49.120 --> 52:51.560]  What you didn't consider is the squirrel dies in the wolf.
[52:51.860 --> 52:52.340]  Wow.
[52:53.320 --> 52:54.700]  Rodent alcohol content.
[52:54.820 --> 52:55.480]  What am I thinking?
[52:55.900 --> 52:57.160]  Did I make this up?
[52:57.300 --> 52:58.060]  Did I dream this?
[52:58.080 --> 52:59.340]  That's an insane search.
[52:59.500 --> 53:00.720]  That's a 12% squirrel.
[53:02.340 --> 53:03.780]  The squirrel's like wine.
[53:03.960 --> 53:05.240]  This is just like mice.
[53:05.800 --> 53:08.020]  This is like the Goldschlager of squirrels.
[53:10.300 --> 53:12.200]  Rodent gets animals drunk.
[53:12.420 --> 53:13.920]  This squirrel's like Ruppelmütz.
[53:14.320 --> 53:14.400]  Fuck.
[53:17.680 --> 53:20.360]  I'd love to see a six pack of squirrels.
[53:20.700 --> 53:22.280]  This is like squirrel ever clear.
[53:22.440 --> 53:24.380]  I'm gonna have a fucking brutal headache tomorrow.
[53:25.620 --> 53:27.720]  Do you want squirrel or do you want squirrel light?
[53:28.340 --> 53:30.080]  I got a big mouth squirrel here.
[53:30.160 --> 53:30.620]  You want a big mouth?
[53:32.560 --> 53:35.100]  You know the squirrel's ready when his tummy's blue.
[53:36.480 --> 53:37.360]  What's going on there?
[53:38.080 --> 53:40.420]  Is that some gross animal testing video?
[53:41.800 --> 53:46.520]  This is researchers are trying to get mice drunk or something.
[53:46.580 --> 53:47.700]  I guess I don't know.
[53:48.880 --> 53:50.140]  That's me in Cancun.
[53:53.100 --> 53:54.700]  That's Javier giving me doubles.
[53:56.600 --> 53:58.500]  That is what you look like at the end.
[53:58.660 --> 54:00.280]  Oh, dude, I was toast.
[54:00.380 --> 54:00.980]  It was bad.
[54:02.200 --> 54:06.340]  Gavin, do you remember any of the hypotheticals that you were laying out to the group?
[54:08.300 --> 54:08.780]  Yeah.
[54:08.780 --> 54:10.580]  Does it involve me dying again?
[54:10.900 --> 54:12.380]  We stayed away from that.
[54:13.500 --> 54:15.000]  It's not good for your dick, though.
[54:15.420 --> 54:19.340]  I think the first one was you get $50,000, but your belly button is seasonal.
[54:20.940 --> 54:21.340]  Okay.
[54:22.040 --> 54:22.920]  What does that mean?
[54:23.360 --> 54:24.780]  I thought it moved around your body.
[54:25.260 --> 54:29.860]  Yeah, it just like rotates around your body until a year later it's in the same spot.
[54:29.920 --> 54:30.360]  Oh, right.
[54:30.500 --> 54:31.400]  Because with the seasons.
[54:31.580 --> 54:31.740]  That's fine.
[54:33.140 --> 54:34.220]  Yeah, that's a yes.
[54:34.520 --> 54:36.000]  Do you have any other ones?
[54:36.460 --> 54:37.160]  That one was easy.
[54:37.840 --> 54:40.060]  But you wouldn't you wouldn't find it weird if, like,
[54:40.540 --> 54:42.980]  in August, your belly button was on your shoulder or something.
[54:43.380 --> 54:43.760]  You wouldn't find it.
[54:43.760 --> 54:47.000]  Okay, well, I guess let me ask is the whole does the whole move?
[54:47.380 --> 54:50.000]  Or is it like any indentation move?
[54:50.020 --> 54:51.040]  Or is it just the thing?
[54:51.800 --> 54:52.760]  What do you think about it?
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.040]  How would you believe the whole world?
[54:59.180 --> 55:01.880]  What do you think he's talking about, Andrew?
[55:03.640 --> 55:05.980]  Well, you know how they have an innie and an outie, right?
[55:06.160 --> 55:06.720]  The belly button.
[55:07.400 --> 55:08.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:09.220 --> 55:10.200]  So if you're an Annie.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.020]  That's your belly button.
[55:12.160 --> 55:12.780]  Yeah, go ahead.
[55:13.100 --> 55:13.400]  Yeah.
[55:14.420 --> 55:15.640]  How do I describe this?
[55:15.660 --> 55:16.480]  So there's a whole.
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.840]  So the belly button itself, it's the thing that does the whole move with the belly button.
[55:24.040 --> 55:24.800]  What are they different?
[55:25.040 --> 55:25.620]  What do you mean?
[55:25.940 --> 55:27.320]  They're the same thing.
[55:27.740 --> 55:28.520]  How are you going to have?
[55:29.620 --> 55:29.860]  What?
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.480]  Okay, no, because this is if the whole moves, I'm less weirded out by it.
[55:34.880 --> 55:35.160]  What do you mean?
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.840]  If I just got a hole with nothing at the bottom of it.
[55:39.180 --> 55:44.100]  But the hole isn't there for no- and then it just happens to have the belly button inside.
[55:44.280 --> 55:45.680]  The belly button causes the hole.
[55:46.120 --> 55:46.860]  It's not a hole either.
[55:46.980 --> 55:48.680]  It's just a little indent.
[55:48.900 --> 55:49.580]  A little crevice.
[55:50.160 --> 55:50.380]  Yeah.
[55:50.780 --> 55:51.120]  Whatever.
[55:51.340 --> 55:52.360]  Sounds like the end of a balloon knot.
[55:53.840 --> 55:55.080]  That's why they cinched it up.
[55:55.540 --> 55:57.200]  I guess I was just curious if it moved.
[55:57.860 --> 55:59.640]  If all the moves are just the one part.
[56:01.540 --> 56:03.720]  How would they move independently of each other?
[56:03.860 --> 56:04.780]  Like, no, I can't visualize.
[56:04.780 --> 56:06.600]  How would they move at all?
[56:06.740 --> 56:08.340]  This is an insane hypothetical.
[56:08.680 --> 56:09.780]  Even if they could move independently.
[56:10.300 --> 56:13.240]  What difference would it make if there's suddenly a big hole on your shoulder?
[56:13.580 --> 56:15.980]  What difference does it make if there's a knot at the bottom of it or not?
[56:17.100 --> 56:18.980]  I think the knot is weirder than the hole.
[56:19.380 --> 56:20.840]  People have to like, look down it.
[56:21.280 --> 56:21.600]  Yeah.
[56:22.440 --> 56:24.460]  They're not going to be looking at my hole, but they'll see my knot.
[56:25.620 --> 56:27.200]  I don't like that sentence.
[56:27.500 --> 56:28.600]  Someone's going to clip that.
[56:28.820 --> 56:30.020]  Someone's going to clip it and make it.
[56:30.120 --> 56:31.440]  That's going to be messed up, man.
[56:31.560 --> 56:32.360]  That's, oh man.
[56:32.600 --> 56:33.480]  Oh, that's a ringtone right there.
[56:33.480 --> 56:35.000]  The knot is just exposed.
[56:35.140 --> 56:37.780]  The hole, there's some secrecy to a hole.
[56:38.900 --> 56:41.400]  You don't necessarily know what's going on with the hole.
[56:41.640 --> 56:42.660]  Clip all that too.
[56:43.220 --> 56:45.500]  You can think that the hole goes somewhere.
[56:46.360 --> 56:49.980]  Like you, if I see a belly button hole on someone's shoulder, I don't go,
[56:50.080 --> 56:51.060]  oh, that's a belly button hole.
[56:51.520 --> 56:52.480]  I go, that's a hole.
[56:53.240 --> 56:53.980]  Wonder what happened there.
[56:54.520 --> 56:55.360]  And I don't judge.
[56:55.800 --> 56:58.520]  You wouldn't think, wow, that looks like they have a belly button on their shoulder.
[56:59.060 --> 57:01.660]  That would be weirder to me because there's mystery.
[57:02.240 --> 57:04.780]  You guys ever see J.J. Abrams talk about the mystery box?
[57:04.940 --> 57:06.200]  It's a delightful thing.
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.540]  The mystery of not knowing.
[57:08.860 --> 57:12.660]  If it was just the foldy belly button part, I would know.
[57:13.060 --> 57:16.440]  Did anybody at any point glean what the fuck he was talking about between
[57:16.440 --> 57:18.140]  the hole and the belly button?
[57:18.640 --> 57:20.460]  Now he's talking about like you wouldn't know.
[57:20.540 --> 57:22.220]  Like it's like Schrodinger's belly button.
[57:22.940 --> 57:23.420]  Yeah.
[57:24.180 --> 57:25.140]  How wouldn't you know?
[57:25.920 --> 57:26.900]  Let me show you.
[57:26.920 --> 57:29.280]  It looks exactly like the belly button on your tummy.
[57:29.420 --> 57:30.540]  It's just on your shoulder.
[57:32.060 --> 57:33.980]  OK, I looked up belly button hole.
[57:35.000 --> 57:35.400]  OK.
[57:36.180 --> 57:39.920]  This and alcohol rats or whatever is going to fuck up your search history.
[57:40.160 --> 57:40.860]  This is bad.
[57:41.860 --> 57:45.900]  OK, so see, I'm posting a photo of a belly button hole.
[57:46.100 --> 57:47.220]  Yeah, belly button.
[57:47.280 --> 57:50.060]  OK, but there's a hole and then there's the button part in it.
[57:50.100 --> 57:51.040]  That's just an innie.
[57:51.560 --> 57:51.960]  Yes.
[57:52.360 --> 57:52.880]  Oh, really?
[57:53.080 --> 57:54.100]  The outie still is.
[57:54.140 --> 57:54.480]  Wait, wait, wait.
[57:54.480 --> 57:55.160]  It's just filled.
[57:55.580 --> 57:55.940]  What do you mean?
[57:56.020 --> 57:56.380]  What do you mean?
[57:56.440 --> 57:56.820]  Oh, OK.
[57:57.360 --> 57:58.160]  What did you just learn?
[57:59.960 --> 58:00.780]  What was learned?
[58:01.470 --> 58:01.700]  What?
[58:05.480 --> 58:07.180]  What's at the bottom of the innie hole?
[58:08.080 --> 58:10.260]  The freaking knot.
[58:11.940 --> 58:14.040]  OK, let me look up an outie.
[58:15.080 --> 58:16.700]  It's the same thing.
[58:16.820 --> 58:18.020]  It's just further out.
[58:18.560 --> 58:19.780]  The outie fills the hole.
[58:21.820 --> 58:22.620]  What is an outie?
[58:22.640 --> 58:24.420]  Is it just like a botched knot?
[58:25.160 --> 58:26.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[58:26.800 --> 58:29.060]  It just didn't stay in.
[58:29.420 --> 58:30.100]  OK, here we go.
[58:30.100 --> 58:32.380]  Maybe the baby coughed wrong and it popped out.
[58:32.580 --> 58:35.140]  This kind of illustrates my point a little bit better.
[58:36.100 --> 58:37.220]  You guys are going to get it now.
[58:37.580 --> 58:41.120]  OK, so see, I'm posting a thing.
[58:41.220 --> 58:41.840]  Oh, gross.
[58:42.080 --> 58:43.360]  Is your belly button an innie or an outie?
[58:43.440 --> 58:44.140]  Oh, I hate this.
[58:44.800 --> 58:45.980]  Yeah, well, this is what you did.
[58:46.520 --> 58:49.780]  See, on the right, I just know that that's a belly button knot.
[58:50.260 --> 58:50.920]  Yeah, but that's...
[58:51.460 --> 58:56.920]  On the left, I know it's a belly button knot because of where the belly button is.
[58:57.080 --> 58:58.580]  Listen, moron.
[58:58.580 --> 59:01.280]  These are saying there's six belly buttons here.
[59:01.420 --> 59:02.660]  These are all belly buttons.
[59:02.920 --> 59:04.920]  Imagine you had number four.
[59:05.280 --> 59:07.380]  It moves around your body seasonally.
[59:07.500 --> 59:09.300]  I don't know what you don't get.
[59:09.420 --> 59:12.300]  You're explaining belly buttons.
[59:12.700 --> 59:13.520]  You can have multiple.
[59:13.660 --> 59:16.580]  Like, when you're a kid, it's probably not going to be as innie as it is now.
[59:16.740 --> 59:17.180]  Right?
[59:17.920 --> 59:18.360]  I...
[59:18.360 --> 59:21.540]  Yeah, guys, I hate to say it, but I think I understand where he's coming from.
[59:21.540 --> 59:22.040]  Oh, no.
[59:22.120 --> 59:23.000]  Here we go.
[59:24.200 --> 59:26.880]  Let me talk it out.
[59:26.880 --> 59:30.120]  Okay, what Andrew's saying, I think, and Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong,
[59:30.540 --> 59:34.520]  but we're going to just go with the top belly button, the left one and the right one, right?
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.900]  We're not going to look at the six, just the top of the image.
[59:37.260 --> 59:40.820]  The belly button on the right, the outie, if you see that on your shoulder,
[59:40.920 --> 59:44.120]  you immediately think, oh, that's a fucking belly button on his shoulder.
[59:44.360 --> 59:47.900]  But if you see the belly button on the left, which is a pretty extreme innie,
[59:48.060 --> 59:49.540]  it just looks like a hole.
[59:49.600 --> 59:51.340]  It could be a staph infection or something.
[59:51.420 --> 59:54.800]  It doesn't necessarily scream belly button.
[59:55.000 --> 59:55.960]  I understand that.
[59:55.960 --> 01:00:02.100]  But when I said your belly button moves, I don't know how we separated those as two things.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.380]  Nobody does. I don't think he does.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.440]  Well, no, I assume that the hole...
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.660]  The hole is...
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.220]  Yeah, so the hole, I was thinking...
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.780]  I guess I just wasn't, I guess. I don't know.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.720]  I just, to me, I feel like the hole is a product of the button.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.600]  But I see what you mean of you couldn't have the hole without the button.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.440]  But in a world in which these are all moving in ridiculous ways,
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.660]  I don't think it's an unfair question to ask if the hole moves.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.500]  You're going to love the clone question Gavin has next for you.
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.940]  That was number three. I was trying to remember number two.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.320]  But that's like saying, like, imagine if your mouth was seasonal
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.920]  and then you were like, wait, is the mouth moving or the hole?
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.600]  It's the same thing.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:50.820]  Yeah, I guess.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.780]  Yeah, I guess your lips would.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:53.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.440]  Yeah, you're right. I just, I don't know.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.780]  I didn't think about belly buttons that much.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.160]  This is the most I've ever thought about belly buttons.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.480]  He keeps saying, yeah, but there's like,
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.700]  I don't think there's any understanding behind it.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.580]  Does anyone remember the next one? I got it.
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.120]  I don't. I just remember the, I just remember the clone one there.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.840]  I think there was one other one, but I don't remember it.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.900]  I don't know, but this just gave me a really weird idea.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.260]  You know how when you pierce your ears and then you have to like pop a hole
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.440]  through your ear and then it's pierced.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.160]  And then if you take your earring out for too long,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.920]  it'll eventually grow over a little bit with a little slap of skin,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.940]  but then you have to pierce it again to repop it.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.900]  What if your butthole worked like that?
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.220]  And like you originally had a grown over butthole
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.820]  and you had to pierce it so that you could poop.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.060]  And then if you like have, I don't know, if you don't poop enough
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.620]  or if you get too constipated, your butthole can grow back over
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.840]  and then you got to repop it every time you got to poop.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.280]  That would suck.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.560]  I mean, isn't that kind of what happened to you when you were off solids
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.200]  for all that time and then you pooped like a little peasworth, but it was really...
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.440]  Yeah, but I didn't have to like break through any skin or anything.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.480]  But yeah, no, it was essentially the same thing.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.600]  I was just thinking more of like having to go to Claire's Boutique
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.780]  to get your butthole pierced again so that you can poop.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.240]  Like if an anus had a regrowable hymen.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.020]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.200]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.400]  Anyway, what was your next? What was your next one?
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.720]  I don't know. But the third one was you get a hundred grand
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.160]  and then a clone, an exact clone of you in this moment,
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.800]  gets birthed from somewhere and then just waits in a hotel room
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.760]  and anyone can go and have sex with it.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.040]  Well, no, you said they can do whatever they want to it,
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.360]  not just have sex with it, which is way worse.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.680]  No, I said they could just go and bang it.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.220]  And then and then Emily was like, oh, but people are going to beat
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.280]  the shit out of it and stuff.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.880]  And you were like, yeah, they do whatever they want.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.620]  They have it for an hour.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.440]  No, I never said they do what they want.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.940]  They just they just have anything sexually, I guess.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.920]  I didn't I didn't assume that I'd mean like beating it and killing it.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.960]  You guys thought I didn't have my story straight with this belly button thing.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.460]  I don't know what you have a clone and you're fucking your clone.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.900]  No one liked this.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.820]  No one liked this, by the way.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.100]  No one was on board with this.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.120]  No, I don't think anyone wanted to do this one.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.260]  But it was the one that had the most discussion around it
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.800]  over and over and over and over.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.580]  And Meg was like, I'm going to find the loophole.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.480]  I should have been here at Cancun.
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.740]  I would have tripled the belly button hole.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.740]  Gavin seems to think it's a good idea.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.720]  My point was, if there are two of me in the world,
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.280]  I must immediately seek that other me out and kill it.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.360]  Because I know the other me that's getting fucking railed by old
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.540]  gross businessmen all day long for $100,000 a pop
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.200]  so that this me can go off and have fucking lavish vacations and stuff
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.460]  while the other me is getting pegged night and day.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.460]  That guy's going to get pissed real fast.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.840]  And he's going to come looking for this me.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.380]  And he's going to take me out and replace me as the real me.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.840]  And he can do that because he is me.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.760]  So I got to kill that motherfucker before he thinks to kill me.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.960]  Yeah, I was just trying to create a bigger moral dilemma than a belly button.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.540]  Is the clone exactly like in every way?
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.620]  In every way the clone exists as me?
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:54.460]  Identical.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.340]  Neg's going to have hers streamed for her.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:58.560]  No.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.220]  I wouldn't, I couldn't do this because I watched,
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.820]  I had this as like a Carl Pilkington thing recently,
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.100]  like a Rick Gervais show clip,
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.660]  where he was concerned he wouldn't know which was him.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.900]  And I agree with that.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:12.820]  Yeah, I remember that clip.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.180]  I think Carl's immediate question was,
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.260]  how would I know which one I was?
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:17.680]  Yes.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.220]  And that would be a dilemma if it is identical.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.300]  Yeah, but that's not, the reason that's a mental thing to say is that
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.080]  you can only experience you.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.360]  If there's three of you, you'll still be you.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.860]  You won't be like, oh, I'm that one over there.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.480]  Well, I wouldn't know if I was the original me or not.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:35.640]  If I was a copy.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:40.700]  What do you mean?
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.520]  That is true.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.700]  The clone doesn't necessarily know it's a clone.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.420]  That's true.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.960]  The clone has no idea it's a clone.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.920]  I would assume that I was the original,
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.920]  but in a world in which there are clones,
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.960]  I also would have to accept the fact I don't necessarily know that.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.700]  Wasn't this a Ewan McGregor movie?
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.260]  You gotta look for the dots under your eye.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:56.660]  It's the island.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.500]  The island, yeah.
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.040]  I don't want...
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.220]  This podcast doesn't need three Emmys all agreeing about belly buttons.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.540]  If this show is all me and just everything that's just,
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.660]  yeah, that makes sense, it would be a lot less interesting.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.320]  All right, there's three of you, but you have to share the belly button.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.520]  It's a timeshare.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.120]  What part of the body do I get it on?
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:19.580]  I don't know.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.120]  I would take shoulder.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.060]  I don't want it on my lower back.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.340]  I would take where a belly button normally goes.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:29.560]  Well, that's not fun.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.560]  If you're going to timeshare a belly button,
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.060]  you might as well get it somewhere else for a little bit of the year.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:35.660]  What?
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.100]  If you're going to timeshare a belly button,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.920]  why would you have it be the exact place you always have it?
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.780]  The whole joy of the timeshare would be to experience something different in a non-permanent
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.020]  way.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.100]  Where's the joy?
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.940]  There's no joy in sharing or in belly button.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.800]  Why else am I paying for this timeshare if it's not about joy?
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:05:59.600]  What?
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.400]  Why am I investing in a timeshare that I'm not enjoying?
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.160]  Okay, so if you could choose to have just a perfectly smooth
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:11.240]  gut with no belly button, would you want that over a belly button?
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.000]  Absolutely.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.020]  Really?
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:13.420]  Why?
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.140]  No strategic defensive deficiencies.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.880]  What the fuck?
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.980]  I think I would swim better too.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.380]  I think I'd be more aerodynamic.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.220]  You're a crazy person.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.200]  Defensive?
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.800]  Well, I've never seen Star Wars, but don't they shoot the ball in like a hole?
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800]  It's like a small hole.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:37.140]  I just feel like the belly button is a weak part of my body.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.240]  The belly button is literally opposite of that.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.700]  It's like a closed door.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.900]  It's so the inside doesn't come out.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.960]  It's welded shut.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.200]  Yeah, but a door can be opened.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:47.180]  Not this door.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:47.680]  Shut by...
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.780]  What is more security or a solid wall or a door?
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.240]  It's a wall.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.340]  A wall is more secure.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.500]  What's the wall?
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.180]  The wall is just around the door.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.000]  So you're saying it's easier to...
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:06.240]  It's easier to penetrate a door than it is a wall because the door is designed to be open.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:11.500]  I figure the belly button's got to be a lot of scar tissue layered on top of each other, right?
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.480]  It's got to be like a little bit of armor more than anything.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.200]  Sounds like suddenly we're all a bunch of experts on how belly buttons work.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.440]  If one of us isn't, I have a feeling I know who that is.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.340]  Well, what's the stronger part of a bank vault, the wall or the door?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.240]  Oh, certainly the wall would have to be equally strong or else what would be the point of the door?
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.880]  Fair point.
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:42.600]  Let's make a vault and have three or four angles that are weak as shit.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.980]  And then one super strong one.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:44.760]  That moves.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.120]  Well, the walls are in the wall.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.080]  Walls are in the wall?
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.000]  You can't often get to the wall from the outside.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.560]  That's my point. You can't even get to it.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.160]  But I don't know if the belly button, you can't even get to it to be a weak point.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:00.880]  It's just gone.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.620]  No, no.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.140]  Yeah.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.000]  Because yeah.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.400]  If you if you remove your nose, you can't break your nose.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:12.720]  Think about it that way.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.980]  Oh, Jeff, did you get a root canal in your teeth?
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.100]  Oh, you don't have any teeth.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:22.760]  You can't.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.360]  They're gone.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.580]  Not that I want that for you, Jeff.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.940]  Don't bring me into this.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:32.300]  My point is, if you don't have a thing, you can't lose the thing.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.820]  But I mean, go all the way.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.020]  If there's no you, you can't break your leg.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.320]  That's true.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.560]  Guess who's never broken their leg?
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.680]  Someone that was never born.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.560]  That's factual.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.660]  So $50,000, but you get born?
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.520]  Is that what we're asking?
[01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.230]  Uh, where did it go off the rails?
[01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.990]  Was it the belly button?
[01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:57.150]  Yeah, it was the belly button.
[01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.430]  Oh, God.
[01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:04.210]  Well, that'll probably do it for this episode, I guess.
[01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.090]  What do you guys think?
[01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.730]  I had a lot of notes that I didn't get to, but I think that's fine.
[01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.810]  Why don't you hit one of your notes?
[01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.390]  Let's go with one of Gavin's notes.
[01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:12.610]  So why don't you play us out?
[01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:14.450]  Can I?
[01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:15.730]  Okay, well, he's taking a long time.
[01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.790]  Can I quickly?
[01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:18.910]  Did you leave your notes in another room?
[01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.370]  Can I say my note?
[01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:20.890]  It's very quick.
[01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:21.310]  It's very brief.
[01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:22.030]  Please, go for it, Andrew.
[01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:24.810]  I brought up the Marvel Rivals thing last episode.
[01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.290]  You know, my name and it being taken.
[01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:31.070]  This was a great opportunity for me to go back to the Facebook group chat of all Andrew Pantons.
[01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:35.130]  I checked in on him because I thought if one of them had it, I wouldn't be upset about it.
[01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:36.390]  I'll let Susan Boyle one.
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.810]  Yeah, none of them have it.
[01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:41.090]  So I'm back to being upset about somebody else taking it.
[01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:42.030]  They don't deserve it.
[01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.750]  They're not part of the chat.
[01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:43.890]  But the Andrew Pantons are good.
[01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.830]  Just an update on the Andrew Pantons.
[01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:46.150]  Gavin.
[01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:49.290]  It's...
[01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:49.790]  I...
[01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:50.290]  There's...
[01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:51.970]  Unplanes, right?
[01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:53.130]  Fucking...
[01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.030]  You guys are gonna...
[01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:58.150]  You side with this guy, this belly button fucking wanting son of a bitch.
[01:09:58.330 --> 01:09:58.850]  I do want one.
[01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:02.070]  Gavin sounded like he was trying to start a lawnmower.
[01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:05.890]  It's a new thing that's happening on planes.
[01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.390]  Well, for some reason, I'll sit down in my seat.
[01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:13.570]  And then every bastard that walks past me has a backpack.
[01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:18.890]  And on the back of their backpack is a neck pillow that hits me in the face.
[01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:23.150]  Every time I sit down on a plane, I get walloped like seven or eight times.
[01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:24.790]  And it didn't used to happen.
[01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:26.710]  Has anyone else experienced this?
[01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:27.590]  No.
[01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.110]  Can't say that.
[01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.530]  Wouldn't happen if you didn't have a face.
[01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:32.530]  Thanks for watching.
[01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:39.450]  Can you believe, Eric and Gavin, can you believe we just created more than an hour of content this
[01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.270]  week? How is that even possible?
[01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.690]  No one else is doing it, man.
[01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:45.270]  No one else is doing it.
[01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:47.950]  I was sharing with them over the break, guys,
[01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:51.270]  that I had a conversation with my daughter when she was in town from college, you know,
[01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:51.850]  for the holiday.
[01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:56.510]  She was very excited because she was going to go see a comedian that she really loves.
[01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.230]  Millie really loves stand-up.
[01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.630]  And so it's like her big thing.
[01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:01.570]  She goes to a lot of stand-up.
[01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:05.010]  And so there's a younger Gen Z stand-up she really digs.
[01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:07.910]  And she was telling me about him and how cool he is and stuff.
[01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:08.850]  And I was like, oh, that's awesome.
[01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:09.250]  That's awesome.
[01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:10.190]  I'm glad you get to go see it.
[01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:10.750]  That's really cool.
[01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:14.810]  And she goes, and dad, it's like the crazy thing is he does his stand-up, right?
[01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:15.990]  He's a stand-up for a living.
[01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:21.950]  But then he has a YouTube channel where he creates like an hour of new content every
[01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:22.930]  fucking week.
[01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:24.210]  Like who's doing that?
[01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.290]  That's game-changing.
[01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:27.370]  And I was just like...
[01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.130]  Is he doing an hour of stand-up every week?
[01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:31.710]  No, it's like a podcast-y conversation type stuff.
[01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:31.950]  Oh.
[01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:33.070]  Yeah, it's like what we...
[01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:38.030]  And I was just like, yeah, who could come up with an hour of new content a week?
[01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.030]  Boy, that's a revolutionary idea.
[01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:42.530]  And there you have it.
[01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.510]  We just did it.
[01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:50.230]  Thanks for tuning in to episode 37 of the Reg You Motherfucking Latian podcast.
[01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:53.670]  It was a joy to perform it for you.
[01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:56.630]  Believe it or not, we nailed it on the third take today.
[01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:57.690]  We'll see you next time.
[01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:59.030]  Don't forget to rate and review.
[01:11:59.130 --> 01:11:59.830]  Bye-bye.
[01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:01.650]  People are going to be real mad at me.
