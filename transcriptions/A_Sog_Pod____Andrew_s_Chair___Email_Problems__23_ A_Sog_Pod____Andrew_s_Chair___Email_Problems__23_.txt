[00:30.380 --> 00:34.700]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is
[00:34.700 --> 00:41.120]  Jeff Ramsey and with me as always, Andrew Pan, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz, and Eric Bedore.
[00:41.820 --> 00:48.780]  This is episode 23 and Gavin has just sent a picture of his crotch. He has peed his pants.
[00:48.780 --> 00:52.560]  That happened maybe 16 seconds before we started.
[00:52.920 --> 00:56.460]  What happened? I spilled water on myself.
[00:57.040 --> 01:00.780]  Oh, yeah, right. Well, it's not piss because piss wouldn't...
[01:00.780 --> 01:02.720]  Oh, I guess piss would start there if my penis was...
[01:04.980 --> 01:07.740]  I'm not sure. Where else would it start, man?
[01:08.440 --> 01:12.060]  I always imagine piss starting right in the center of the crotch, but if your
[01:12.060 --> 01:14.920]  penis has any length, it may start down there.
[01:17.640 --> 01:19.860]  So, are you the new piss boy or what's going on?
[01:20.580 --> 01:21.480]  Take it out of the cats.
[01:21.500 --> 01:23.060]  Well, it's not piss though.
[01:24.820 --> 01:28.900]  I mean, I'm just having a look. Are you doing it? Are you going shmee mode in your own office?
[01:29.500 --> 01:30.220]  Are you spraying?
[01:31.320 --> 01:32.500]  Oh, is it spray?
[01:32.820 --> 01:33.680]  Are you mad at you?
[01:34.240 --> 01:36.240]  Let me piss in one of the outlets.
[01:36.960 --> 01:40.320]  Do you feel like you've been gone too much recently and so you're just punishing yourself?
[01:43.020 --> 01:45.560]  Oh, man, I've got a soggy podcast ahead of me.
[01:45.860 --> 01:47.720]  Oh, no, a sog pod.
[01:49.300 --> 01:54.000]  You know, I'll take piss boy for an episode. This will be my sog pod as piss boy.
[01:54.480 --> 01:57.660]  Yeah, you could be either soggy or Donald Duck.
[01:58.120 --> 01:58.840]  You've got two options.
[01:59.020 --> 01:59.700]  Good way to put it.
[02:00.780 --> 02:05.980]  I like that you have a wet left pocket and a little bit of a wet like right...
[02:05.980 --> 02:08.980]  Well, not pocket, but like front shorts on your knees.
[02:08.980 --> 02:13.040]  It's like you piss so hard on the left, it shot to the right.
[02:13.280 --> 02:15.120]  Like you fire hosed it.
[02:15.300 --> 02:16.420]  Like it launched from...
[02:16.420 --> 02:18.120]  Yeah, it's that wetness on the right.
[02:18.560 --> 02:19.960]  Yeah, isn't there a little bit?
[02:20.280 --> 02:20.920]  No, it's just...
[02:20.920 --> 02:21.880]  Oh, is it the pattern?
[02:22.420 --> 02:23.480]  Yeah, just piss.
[02:24.380 --> 02:26.760]  Never mind then. I thought you got both legs.
[02:27.940 --> 02:28.900]  How disappointing.
[02:29.880 --> 02:30.580]  How are you guys doing?
[02:31.040 --> 02:31.800]  We've had a good...
[02:32.380 --> 02:32.860]  Good.
[02:33.140 --> 02:35.920]  I have a fucking note and I was looking over my notes.
[02:36.200 --> 02:38.280]  We were coming from another recording right into this.
[02:38.280 --> 02:39.120]  I didn't have time to prepare.
[02:39.780 --> 02:42.940]  And I have a note that I remember writing down yesterday.
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.960]  And do you have those notes where you don't feel like you need
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.340]  to explain it further because you'll remember?
[02:48.840 --> 02:49.100]  Yeah.
[02:49.620 --> 02:52.120]  I wrote down, I'm so dumb.
[02:52.960 --> 02:55.240]  And I don't know what the fuck that means.
[02:55.560 --> 02:56.020]  All right.
[02:56.100 --> 02:59.100]  That could be written before every single note you've ever made.
[02:59.320 --> 02:59.500]  Yeah.
[02:59.820 --> 03:01.360]  I don't know what the...
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.620]  I must have done something so stupid yesterday that I thought writing down
[03:05.620 --> 03:08.620]  that alone was enough to remember it 24 hours later.
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.980]  That, in fact, was dumb.
[03:11.720 --> 03:16.340]  You didn't know it at the time, but your note was a reflection of the action you were currently doing.
[03:16.960 --> 03:18.200]  What could it be?
[03:19.040 --> 03:21.120]  Oh, what have you done recently that's...
[03:21.120 --> 03:21.960]  What did you do yesterday?
[03:22.300 --> 03:22.840]  Stupid potential.
[03:23.640 --> 03:24.200]  Piss your pants?
[03:25.700 --> 03:29.760]  No, the last time I did anything like that was when I shit my pants at Gavin's wedding.
[03:32.360 --> 03:33.020]  I've been...
[03:33.020 --> 03:33.880]  I've had a dry...
[03:33.880 --> 03:35.460]  I've had dry undies since then.
[03:35.460 --> 03:36.540]  I went for a bike ride.
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.840]  I had a normal day yesterday, I think.
[03:39.300 --> 03:40.740]  Did you do something in a car that was stupid?
[03:40.960 --> 03:41.860]  Did you rip a pump off?
[03:42.180 --> 03:43.260]  I didn't rip any pumps off.
[03:43.300 --> 03:48.540]  I did drive around town yesterday, but nothing funny happened.
[03:48.820 --> 03:51.340]  Did you get pushed over by a ghost or whatever?
[03:51.660 --> 03:53.320]  No, I don't remember any ghosts.
[03:53.840 --> 03:54.340]  I don't know.
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.720]  Maybe it'll come to me, but I...
[03:56.580 --> 04:00.720]  Anyway, that was my only note for today, other than I saw three Dobermans.
[04:02.120 --> 04:03.660]  What time did you write the note?
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.140]  I wish it said.
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.720]  So I wrote it before I wrote my most recent Doberman update, which would have been yesterday.
[04:11.700 --> 04:12.560]  I guess.
[04:12.900 --> 04:13.980]  Maybe it was the day before yesterday?
[04:14.120 --> 04:14.600]  I don't know.
[04:15.320 --> 04:18.280]  Did you see some dogs that weren't Dobermans, but you thought they were Dobermans?
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.760]  And then you just went, classic Jeff.
[04:22.360 --> 04:24.180]  No, I don't think so.
[04:24.900 --> 04:28.440]  Well, I have an exciting thing to share that I don't think you guys know about.
[04:28.940 --> 04:30.720]  While you're pondering, this is...
[04:31.600 --> 04:34.680]  I have so much cool stuff from the community this week
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.340]  that I'm so excited to get your guys' reaction on this.
[04:38.420 --> 04:39.320]  You especially, Jeff.
[04:39.520 --> 04:42.180]  Are you ready to have your mind blown?
[04:42.320 --> 04:42.700]  To be excited?
[04:42.980 --> 04:43.760]  Are you ready to react, Jeff?
[04:44.900 --> 04:49.640]  I had somebody, someone in our community reached out to our Patreon page
[04:49.640 --> 04:55.660]  and sent us a message sharing a regulation-inspired game
[04:55.660 --> 05:03.800]  that they've made that is coming out and will be free based on the idea that you had, Jeff,
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.960]  of Tombstone Bingo.
[05:06.660 --> 05:08.960]  It is called Tombstone Tally.
[05:09.880 --> 05:15.880]  And it is a game in which you run around a cemetery and have to do bingo.
[05:16.820 --> 05:19.760]  It is a scavenger hunt.
[05:19.920 --> 05:21.600]  Yeah, it's going to be on Steam.
[05:22.100 --> 05:23.120]  It's multiplayer.
[05:23.500 --> 05:25.940]  We're absolutely going to play this when it comes out.
[05:25.960 --> 05:28.560]  It is, I guess, supposed to be like...
[05:28.560 --> 05:29.680]  Spicy garlic games.
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.440]  It's supposed to be like a nod to our show and the community.
[05:34.440 --> 05:37.260]  There's a lot of inside jokes, apparently, in the game.
[05:37.520 --> 05:38.480]  It looks great.
[05:38.960 --> 05:41.340]  Oh, I cannot believe that this is the thing that's happening.
[05:41.740 --> 05:42.720]  It's full on bingo.
[05:42.820 --> 05:44.440]  You have a bingo card that you pull up.
[05:44.480 --> 05:46.520]  I'm watching like the about this game and everything.
[05:46.940 --> 05:51.700]  You're trying to find specific stuff on these tombstones and you have a bingo card.
[05:52.040 --> 05:52.920]  This is crazy.
[05:53.300 --> 05:54.060]  This is crazy.
[05:54.300 --> 05:55.560]  This is unbelievable.
[05:56.200 --> 06:00.160]  We were trying to find games that have graveyards to try to make something out of,
[06:00.340 --> 06:01.540]  like, around something else.
[06:01.540 --> 06:05.000]  They just went and made a game that is what you talked about.
[06:05.440 --> 06:06.260]  So is it random?
[06:06.460 --> 06:07.740]  Is it different every time?
[06:08.080 --> 06:08.820]  I have no idea.
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.360]  I can't answer that.
[06:10.380 --> 06:12.260]  But the fact that this is a thing is insane.
[06:12.280 --> 06:13.880]  This is so fucking cool.
[06:14.040 --> 06:17.380]  This game's great because it stops us from doing something really offensive.
[06:18.540 --> 06:20.640]  And thank you so much for that.
[06:20.740 --> 06:21.960]  I really do appreciate it.
[06:22.620 --> 06:23.980]  Wouldn't have been offensive.
[06:24.320 --> 06:25.740]  Would have been a loving send up.
[06:26.780 --> 06:27.660]  Fighting zombies.
[06:27.800 --> 06:28.860]  This is even better, though.
[06:29.020 --> 06:29.720]  This is even better.
[06:30.520 --> 06:32.520]  Yeah, I guess there's like a...
[06:32.520 --> 06:33.680]  Like the ragdoll.
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.900]  Oh, yeah, it looks fantastic.
[06:37.200 --> 06:42.440]  So thank you so much to Spicy Garlic Games, I guess, for putting this together.
[06:42.680 --> 06:44.080]  I cannot wait to try this.
[06:44.300 --> 06:46.040]  I am so excited to try this.
[06:46.080 --> 06:47.260]  Do you know when it'll be out?
[06:47.560 --> 06:51.960]  I don't think they have said, but they did say it would be free.
[06:52.500 --> 06:57.100]  So anyone who's listening who has steam should be able to pick it up and play it, I assume.
[06:57.760 --> 06:58.740]  But I don't know that.
[06:58.740 --> 07:00.580]  That is unbelievably cool.
[07:00.620 --> 07:03.700]  It looks so cool running around like co-op.
[07:04.460 --> 07:05.400]  It's like a groundskeeper.
[07:05.460 --> 07:06.960]  Looks like that maybe targets you.
[07:07.120 --> 07:08.120]  Looks like a lot of fun.
[07:08.360 --> 07:10.640]  So I just wanted to make sure that we highlighted that.
[07:10.920 --> 07:11.600]  No, absolutely.
[07:12.700 --> 07:14.980]  That's that is fucking amazing.
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.220]  Second community thing I have, I just might as well just unload on the community stuff.
[07:20.680 --> 07:26.480]  We got sent something that is really cool that was reached out a long time ago.
[07:26.480 --> 07:32.500]  It's been a long time in the works for this person who owns this business called Hand and Sew,
[07:32.700 --> 07:33.540]  I believe.
[07:33.680 --> 07:37.660]  And they reached out about doing keychains, I guess it's a product that they typically make.
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.600]  And they have made, look at this, an Ian keychain for us.
[07:45.380 --> 07:45.520]  What?
[07:45.900 --> 07:47.580]  And they did 500 of them.
[07:48.140 --> 07:48.700]  Wow.
[07:49.260 --> 07:50.900]  It's like stamped leather with gold foil.
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.140]  I believe so.
[07:52.360 --> 07:52.720]  Yes.
[07:53.320 --> 07:54.480]  That is so cool.
[07:54.480 --> 07:56.920]  They're sending them to our PO box.
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.100]  I figured that could be like a fun thing that like we send out to people on occasion.
[08:03.440 --> 08:05.580]  Dude, that is that is so awesome.
[08:05.780 --> 08:06.660]  That is such a cool idea.
[08:06.780 --> 08:11.240]  And I'm so excited to get actual mail to our PO box instead of mail for the two people
[08:11.240 --> 08:14.200]  that aren't us that I continually have to return.
[08:16.060 --> 08:19.840]  Maybe I could take 10 of those and just give them to people if I see them out in public.
[08:19.960 --> 08:20.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[08:20.620 --> 08:21.020]  Absolutely.
[08:21.140 --> 08:22.360]  I think it's a great idea.
[08:22.680 --> 08:23.580]  I think that's so cool.
[08:23.580 --> 08:25.660]  Getting these sent and everything is is really awesome.
[08:25.820 --> 08:27.980]  What was the name of this of the people again?
[08:28.380 --> 08:29.400]  Uh, let me pull it up.
[08:29.700 --> 08:30.800]  I believe it's Hand & Sew.
[08:31.080 --> 08:32.320]  Hand & Sew, I think is what you said.
[08:32.800 --> 08:33.140]  Yes.
[08:34.100 --> 08:34.940]  So cool.
[08:35.300 --> 08:36.140]  Yeah, they're really awesome.
[08:37.660 --> 08:44.660]  If we're talking about this stuff that's getting sent to us, can we talk about what
[08:44.660 --> 08:49.760]  we have coming up later in November for what we're merch?
[08:50.080 --> 08:50.960]  I think we probably should.
[08:50.960 --> 08:54.380]  OK, so it's been a long time coming.
[08:54.580 --> 08:55.080]  This is fun.
[08:55.140 --> 08:56.300]  This is like an announcements episode.
[08:56.340 --> 08:56.900]  This is exciting.
[08:58.060 --> 08:59.320]  It's been a long time coming.
[08:59.420 --> 09:05.040]  We've been working with some people with Tony and some other people to get this going.
[09:05.300 --> 09:08.520]  But we are opening a regulation store.
[09:09.000 --> 09:09.620]  Oh, shit.
[09:09.980 --> 09:11.660]  Later this month.
[09:11.780 --> 09:12.380]  Did you say OSHA?
[09:12.480 --> 09:13.760]  OSHA has nothing to do with this.
[09:13.840 --> 09:14.580]  Don't say OSHA.
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.840]  Wait, by the time this is out, we'll have more sort of firm updates on
[09:20.840 --> 09:22.960]  where everything is and dates and everything.
[09:23.780 --> 09:25.940]  But we're opening a regulation store.
[09:26.740 --> 09:32.360]  We're working on getting a regulation shirt that will be very simple.
[09:32.560 --> 09:36.920]  It's really for us to sort of stretch our legs and try this stuff and make sure that
[09:36.920 --> 09:42.480]  we have no issues with what we're trying to sell.
[09:42.880 --> 09:45.360]  So the shirt will be coming out later in October.
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.600]  And then in November, late November, we're trying to settle on the date and everything.
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.520]  But late November, we will be releasing our first ever regulation Gerpler.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.520]  It's a brand new Gerpler.
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.380]  It is... I mean, should we share images of it and stuff?
[10:01.560 --> 10:03.420]  I don't see why we couldn't.
[10:03.520 --> 10:04.240]  Who's going to stop us?
[10:04.420 --> 10:06.520]  Big Teeth can't stop us, Eric.
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.140]  Yeah, that's true.
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.680]  I mean, it's up to us one way or the other if we're going to do this.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.440]  So the new Gerpler that we will be releasing is like...
[10:18.100 --> 10:19.160]  What would you call it?
[10:19.160 --> 10:20.620]  Transparent black?
[10:21.100 --> 10:21.880]  I'm not sure.
[10:22.080 --> 10:23.660]  It's a regulation color.
[10:24.200 --> 10:24.660]  It is.
[10:25.860 --> 10:26.840]  It's a very...
[10:27.520 --> 10:28.500]  It's like smoky.
[10:28.900 --> 10:34.960]  It is like a dusky, low-opacity black sort of look.
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.440]  Think of like an Eastern European cigar lounge at three in the morning.
[10:38.600 --> 10:38.840]  Yeah.
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.280]  And so here, I can share the image here.
[10:43.940 --> 10:50.820]  So what we're sort of looking at is, I think, being able to put this out
[10:50.820 --> 10:54.080]  and you guys are going to be able to get the Gerpler.
[10:54.580 --> 10:55.160]  Yes.
[10:55.200 --> 10:57.960]  It looks fantastic. Very happy about it.
[10:58.400 --> 11:06.020]  We have... I think the number is 4,000 because we wanted to really overestimate.
[11:06.660 --> 11:09.620]  We're taking a bit of a risk here.
[11:10.540 --> 11:12.660]  We're trying not to get out ahead of our skis.
[11:12.660 --> 11:17.060]  But the Gerpler has been far and away the most sought after product of all the products
[11:17.060 --> 11:18.620]  we've released time and time again.
[11:18.980 --> 11:23.360]  And we wanted to make as many as we could conceivably make
[11:23.360 --> 11:26.700]  without tanking the company if you don't buy them.
[11:26.980 --> 11:31.880]  The original question from Eric, I think, was, do we want 500 or 1,000?
[11:32.180 --> 11:35.560]  And I just got flat PTSD flashbacks.
[11:35.860 --> 11:36.120]  Yeah.
[11:36.140 --> 11:37.980]  Everyone being pissed off that they didn't get one.
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.180]  So I think I put 5,000 and then we settled on four.
[11:42.180 --> 11:47.380]  Yes, I'm always going to be more conservative when it comes to this stuff because I'd rather
[11:47.380 --> 11:51.080]  have it sell out and then we don't eat the cost of having to store it anywhere.
[11:51.860 --> 11:52.340]  So...
[11:52.340 --> 11:53.020]  See, that's where we differ.
[11:53.380 --> 11:58.820]  I'd rather have a really funny amount of cups left over than have everyone be really mad.
[12:00.540 --> 12:04.820]  Well, a very funny amount of cups left over to me is zero cups.
[12:04.820 --> 12:07.980]  So I want no...
[12:07.980 --> 12:13.160]  So I am putting this in the community's hands and saying,
[12:13.300 --> 12:17.320]  please buy these cups in late November because we have a lot.
[12:17.420 --> 12:17.860]  Yeah.
[12:17.920 --> 12:18.860]  We have a lot.
[12:19.220 --> 12:24.080]  And I think that obviously we can have further discussions about this, but I think
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.720]  with trying to move that many, we probably wouldn't put a limit on number either.
[12:30.080 --> 12:30.600]  So...
[12:30.600 --> 12:31.440]  Yeah, I agree.
[12:31.540 --> 12:34.620]  And I think probably maybe trying to do like a live stream in support of it
[12:34.620 --> 12:38.520]  and everything. We're just... we have like a lot of ideas, but we finally got this stuff.
[12:38.620 --> 12:43.500]  Like I got the sample. We finally have like the look of it. We settled on like a lot of stuff.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.420]  It's very... man.
[12:46.680 --> 12:50.100]  Believe it or not, we started working on this in early June.
[12:50.540 --> 12:50.720]  Yeah.
[12:50.860 --> 12:55.280]  And there were shades of transparent black that we weren't happy with.
[12:55.500 --> 12:56.200]  Oh my god.
[12:56.480 --> 12:56.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:57.140 --> 13:03.240]  We went through a lot of samples to get this right for you guys because we wanted it to be
[13:03.240 --> 13:08.380]  a very specific look. We wanted it to be regulation. And it looks awesome. It looks so cool.
[13:08.600 --> 13:13.740]  And we're working with a company called El Famoso to put it all together and do this.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.800]  So we're really excited to be able to get new stuff in the store and make everything happen
[13:19.800 --> 13:23.880]  and get more stuff out to you guys. So stay tuned.
[13:24.180 --> 13:29.980]  Super, super excited. And this is going to be very informative for us. If we release
[13:29.980 --> 13:35.600]  4,000 and they sell out immediately, we're so sorry. That is an insane amount of demand
[13:35.600 --> 13:42.820]  that we couldn't afford to seed ahead of time. But it will help us know if we release 4,000
[13:42.820 --> 13:48.520]  and we have 3,800 at the end of the month that Gavin will have his funny amount of cups and
[13:48.520 --> 13:53.700]  we'll end up building an island out of cups and trying to move off to it to avoid paying taxes or
[13:53.700 --> 14:01.680]  something. But yeah, we will take the information that we've learned for this. We desperately want
[14:01.680 --> 14:08.040]  everybody to get an item if they want it. We really do. And so just so that you know,
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.180]  just because we're releasing 4,000 in this way, this isn't how things are going to go.
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.900]  This is us testing the waters to see what tolerance you guys have, what you actually
[14:17.900 --> 14:22.960]  want from us. And then based on that, we'll go forward and merge. But we have mentioned a lot
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.040]  early on that merch wasn't going to be a focus from the beginning. We were really more concerned
[14:27.040 --> 14:33.020]  about just crafting the best product for you guys and really filling that out and then using merch
[14:33.020 --> 14:38.840]  to, I don't know, support that down the road. That's still kind of the path. This is us
[14:38.840 --> 14:44.320]  slow walking this. It is. And try to be very careful with it. We don't want there to be a
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.140]  problem on launch. We don't want you guys to have a problem on launch. We're terrified of that.
[14:48.140 --> 14:53.840]  Yeah, that'd be awful. That's obviously something that's why we're putting in time and figuring
[14:53.840 --> 14:59.300]  stuff out. And our number one issue when we're doing merch before was the frustration of things
[14:59.300 --> 15:05.120]  selling out. So this is an attempt on our behalf of what is the furthest we can push it while also
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.720]  attempting to make sure that everyone who wants one can get one. And then based on the intel or
[15:09.720 --> 15:13.360]  data we receive from this, we'll adjust. I don't doubt that there won't be
[15:14.160 --> 15:21.140]  unforeseen problems. Oh, it's us. The site could go down. Who knows? Yeah, it's us. Something will
[15:21.140 --> 15:26.400]  go wrong. Undeniably. And we should also say that, you know, extra thanks to everyone who's
[15:26.400 --> 15:34.140]  supporting us on Patreon. Because of that, we can buy 4000 of something. There's no way we could
[15:34.140 --> 15:39.300]  have done this if it wasn't for people supporting us on Patreon. There's no shot. We wouldn't have
[15:39.300 --> 15:43.960]  conversations. We wouldn't have been able to get as many tests as we got. We wouldn't have been
[15:43.960 --> 15:48.380]  able to do this the way we wanted to. This fucking company begins and ends with Patreon.
[15:48.680 --> 15:56.300]  They are the lifeblood of what we're doing. Now I'm going to get into the blowjob portion of the
[15:56.300 --> 16:01.680]  episode. But I was thinking about that yesterday when I was getting coffee in the morning. It is
[16:01.680 --> 16:10.600]  so unbelievable the consistent from day one and continuous groundswell of support that the
[16:11.480 --> 16:18.000]  regulation listeners and comment leavers have really granted us. I don't know. I genuinely...
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  I don't know about you guys. We're six months down the road now, five months down the road into this
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.900]  company. But I still wake up every day and I'm just fucking floored that it's what we're going
[16:26.900 --> 16:30.100]  to be doing. That I'm going to sit down in front of a computer with y'all and get to crank this
[16:30.100 --> 16:37.740]  stuff out. It's beyond a dream come true. It's so weird because we hit the ground running so hard.
[16:38.140 --> 16:42.900]  I never really had time to look back. But we're six months down the road from rooster teeth going
[16:42.900 --> 16:49.740]  under and all of that. And it's just crazy to be able to look back amongst the last six months.
[16:50.080 --> 16:55.280]  And we didn't skip a beat. We didn't slow down. And it's only because of the audience.
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.920]  100%. For transparency too. I mean, with us moving down six months and everything,
[17:02.060 --> 17:05.500]  we've got a lot of the backend stuff figured out. We have like a lot of our
[17:05.500 --> 17:10.060]  our sort of like business operations figured out and everything. But for transparency sake,
[17:11.200 --> 17:16.720]  we started working with Shelby, who's someone that we started working with at Achievement
[17:16.720 --> 17:25.260]  Hunter and Rooster Teeth and everything to help us with our social media and posting. Because we
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.440]  have a devoted fan base and you guys who are listening to this every week and
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.180]  you know, very into it and everything. There are twice as many people who go,
[17:34.640 --> 17:39.680]  hey, so Rooster Teeth shut down. What are you doing now? And we need help getting like the word
[17:39.680 --> 17:44.280]  out. And Shelby's doing a really great job so far, like putting that stuff together and getting
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.260]  that stuff out there. So that way more people can check out the show and we can continue to
[17:49.260 --> 17:54.240]  grow, but not in a way that is like an insane exponential thing, just in a way where we can
[17:54.240 --> 17:59.460]  keep doing what we're doing the way that we want to do it. Yeah, we're not going to end up selling
[17:59.460 --> 18:04.780]  shirts that like none of us have seen, which I think did happen a few times. Yes. And I made
[18:04.780 --> 18:10.520]  sure yesterday that everyone saw that shirt and we walked in on it. You're talking about
[18:10.520 --> 18:16.140]  appreciation, Jeff, with the thing and like feeling it every day. It is. I am like obnoxiously
[18:16.140 --> 18:21.620]  appreciative where I think about like every day, as you said, it comes up and I've made probably
[18:21.620 --> 18:26.360]  like seven or eight posts about it. And it's just like every day I want to make another. But like,
[18:26.440 --> 18:32.340]  it's hard now because it's it's not like the audience can know how you're feeling at all
[18:32.340 --> 18:37.440]  times. So it's like this weird thing of like, I am so fucking thankful for the support we've received
[18:37.440 --> 18:44.520]  and just overwhelmed by everything. And it's just been so much fun building this and trying to
[18:44.520 --> 18:50.540]  create something that is both so much fun for us and connects with the people that are kind enough
[18:50.540 --> 18:56.780]  and for whatever reason, believe in us. I guess ultimately, I agree with you completely. And I
[18:56.780 --> 19:02.580]  guess ultimately, I just want the audience to know whether you pay through Patreon or whether you
[19:02.580 --> 19:07.420]  just listen through the Apple podcast app or Spotify, or you just watch a couple of gameplays
[19:07.420 --> 19:16.520]  on YouTube. Just we do not take it for granted. I just we are are so fucking cognizant and
[19:16.520 --> 19:24.920]  conscious of how lucky we are and the runway you've given us to get to continue to create this
[19:24.920 --> 19:28.560]  kind of content. And I just I just want you to know, we don't take it for granted. We appreciate
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.160]  it every single day of our lives. Couldn't have said it better. I feel like that was a little
[19:33.160 --> 19:38.400]  sausage talk. Oh, before we move off of our little sausage talk, you may note of it, Eric,
[19:38.780 --> 19:42.360]  but we're doing Tony stuff with the merch Alphamosa. And it's also like some rooster
[19:42.360 --> 19:48.600]  people that were that were there, which I think is so cool. Tony, the catalyst of so many of our
[19:48.600 --> 19:55.020]  just dumbest ideas and being able to work with him in some capacity going forward was really
[19:55.020 --> 20:01.440]  important to us. And so being able to do that, it is so exciting. I am texting Tony about stuff
[20:02.100 --> 20:08.460]  occasionally that I know whenever I'm able to text Tony about a dumb idea and then seeing him
[20:08.460 --> 20:14.140]  like the gears turn and figure out a way and like different angles on what as it's incredible.
[20:14.180 --> 20:19.680]  I'm so excited for the potential of what the future can bring as far as the merch stuff goes.
[20:22.760 --> 20:28.000]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your to do list is
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.020]  a great feeling. And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you
[20:33.020 --> 20:37.600]  choose an option that's right for you. Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.320]  using the award-winning app, it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits
[20:42.320 --> 20:50.880]  your needs. Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there. If this were a Reese's TV ad, you'd be
[20:50.880 --> 20:56.440]  staring at a Reese's peanut butter cup. And sure, my voice is peanut buttery smooth, but still,
[20:56.620 --> 21:01.880]  you need to see the peanut butter cups, right? No? I can really just say Reese's and you'll go
[21:01.880 --> 21:10.820]  get some. Okay. Reese's. Reese's. Reese's. Really working, actually. Reese's. Reese's.
[21:11.160 --> 21:16.460]  This... I'm on to something. Reese's. Reese's. Reese's.
[21:19.430 --> 21:25.070]  I have a small follow-up. Jeff, you were talking about your face recently, where you had to go
[21:25.070 --> 21:29.470]  and find Nick a bunch of old episodes. Yeah. Because you named them all stupid and because
[21:29.470 --> 21:34.570]  of pleasantries. How long did it take you to get all your files? So long. It was really hard. It's
[21:34.570 --> 21:42.010]  like all day. I did the same, uh, the same ones? Three minutes. Son of a bitch. Go to my thing and
[21:42.010 --> 21:51.090]  just drag them over. I have an unfortunate update. Moving away from our sausage talk portion.
[21:51.650 --> 21:59.490]  Oh. My chair broke. Oh! Chair is broken again. It was September again. It's the month of breaking
[21:59.490 --> 22:04.070]  chairs. When did it, when did it break? What day did it break? Uh, over the weekend. I put it in
[22:04.070 --> 22:10.310]  the slack. What is today? Today's October, uh, October 3rd. Yeah. It was right at the end of
[22:10.310 --> 22:18.450]  September. How did it break? What level of broke? This is the Herman Miller, right? This is the
[22:19.510 --> 22:24.130]  instructional information on how to use the chair. This is, we're going to get into this. So I got
[22:24.130 --> 22:31.470]  the Herman Miller and it's great. It's a really nice chair. On day two, a bolt fell out of the
[22:31.470 --> 22:37.370]  side of it on the second day. And my seat, like my seat dropped. So how, I don't know if you have
[22:37.370 --> 22:42.390]  one of these, you'll know what I mean, but the way the armrests work, a bolt goes through the
[22:42.390 --> 22:47.290]  armrests and that's what holds the seat up on each side. Did you build this chair or it came
[22:47.290 --> 22:53.190]  pre-assembled? It came pre-assembled. So on the second day I sit and the bolt on one of the sides
[22:53.190 --> 22:59.050]  falls out. And I thought, un-fucking-believable. This chair broke two days in. This is a top of
[22:59.050 --> 23:04.350]  the line, high-end chair. I looked at it, I went and I got a screwdriver. I was able to secure
[23:04.350 --> 23:09.570]  the bolt back in. So I thought, that's fine. Whatever. Like clearly this is not set up
[23:09.570 --> 23:14.650]  correctly, but I can just tighten it whenever it gets loose. And so that is what I had been doing
[23:14.650 --> 23:20.050]  this entire time. Occasionally it would fall out and I'd have to completely tighten it from
[23:20.050 --> 23:27.170]  the beginning. It was just a process I was doing. I had noticed recently that it was looking not
[23:27.170 --> 23:33.210]  great on that one side. Like it was getting progressively worse. And so I took the Herman
[23:33.210 --> 23:38.750]  Miller chair and I put it on top of the bed just so I could like really evaluate things.
[23:38.750 --> 23:44.730]  Of course you did. And I tightened it. And while it was on the bed, I thought,
[23:45.270 --> 23:51.750]  well, this is a great time for me to look at all these different levers and switches and figure out
[23:51.750 --> 23:57.870]  this stuff. And so I looked at it and it all was like, okay, interesting. This does that,
[23:57.990 --> 24:01.290]  this does that. I was looking at the instructions. Is it going to be all prepared? I learned how to
[24:01.290 --> 24:07.430]  raise the chair because it has just been at the lowest height this entire time. What do you mean
[24:07.430 --> 24:16.130]  do you mean? It's the most commonly used thing on the chair. Yeah. I just, I've never, it's always
[24:16.130 --> 24:23.610]  been at the lowest setting. And so I raised it. I was like, oh, I'll be able to bring up on the
[24:23.610 --> 24:29.990]  show. Like I figured out where the raise seat switches. Let me guess. It was just, it was
[24:29.990 --> 24:36.110]  below your ass on the right side somewhere. No, it's, uh, it's like on the armrest thing,
[24:36.110 --> 24:45.350]  I believe. Even, even easier. Yeah. Anyway. So I raised it and then I sat in it and the chair
[24:45.350 --> 24:55.090]  exploded. What had happened is the bolt that was supporting it flew out and it stripped,
[24:55.330 --> 25:01.910]  it not only took the inner bolt with it, it stripped all of the, the, the inside of the chair.
[25:01.910 --> 25:08.310]  So I can't turn your chair into like a hydraulic cannon. Essentially. Yeah. I guess what happened
[25:08.310 --> 25:14.590]  is because it was at the lowest height, it was just, there was no give for it. So even though
[25:14.590 --> 25:20.190]  it was crooked, like it was fine. But then when I gave it space, when I elevated it,
[25:20.370 --> 25:25.170]  it had like, it it's been broken, I guess this whole, this whole time. And I just didn't know.
[25:26.150 --> 25:31.190]  I thought I was fixing it each time when I would tighten it, but really it was just still broken.
[25:31.190 --> 25:35.350]  So it shot out. And now is it now does, what does the chair do?
[25:35.910 --> 25:39.830]  Now the chair has no support on the left side of it.
[25:41.450 --> 25:45.810]  I mean, it's, it's a Herman Miller, right? So they'll probably replace it.
[25:47.170 --> 25:52.990]  Here's the problem. Yeah. I got sent all of that information on my rooster teeth email. Cause it
[25:52.990 --> 25:58.530]  was from the whole idea was we're going to do stuff around the chair and then rooster teeth
[25:58.530 --> 26:02.990]  got shut down as you may know. But your email is still on your mail app, right?
[26:04.010 --> 26:10.150]  I don't have any access to that inbox. You never downloaded any email? We went over this. No,
[26:10.710 --> 26:15.170]  I had zero. I didn't know you could download the inbox. It never occurred to me that I would want
[26:15.170 --> 26:20.690]  to. I like that he sounds mad at you about this. No, not mad at you in the slightest. I should
[26:20.690 --> 26:26.190]  have done that. I just didn't know. Did you use the mail app on your Mac? No. Or were you just
[26:26.190 --> 26:33.650]  in the browser? Browser. You're a browser guy, aren't you? You're a real browser. My mail,
[26:34.130 --> 26:37.590]  my mail doesn't work on my computer. And I don't know what's going on with that. What do you mean?
[26:37.630 --> 26:42.670]  Let's get into this. Okay. I am so excited. I'm so thrilled by the turn this episode just took.
[26:42.790 --> 26:48.510]  Andrew computer stuff makes me so happy. So the chair is dead. I've ordered another chair. I'm
[26:48.510 --> 26:52.690]  hoping I can find the paperwork and I can potentially get this one repaired. But if not,
[26:52.690 --> 26:59.510]  I'm just I have to swap out chairs. My computer problem at some point. So I was using the Safari
[26:59.510 --> 27:09.030]  mail client. And my. What? What? What? Stamp the stamp. Mail. Mail. Whatever. Why Safari? Safari
[27:09.030 --> 27:14.150]  has nothing to do with the mail app. Doesn't it? They're both blue. Anyway, I was using the
[27:14.150 --> 27:21.210]  postage stamp and. Yeah. I sent a bunch of emails out. And it didn't go through.
[27:21.910 --> 27:28.330]  And then I re-sent those emails out using the browser. And the postage stamp said we've
[27:28.330 --> 27:33.730]  we're out of sync or something. Let me just try to open. I'll just click the mail thing and see
[27:33.730 --> 27:39.030]  what it says. It said something like the SMTP Google blah, blah, blah. Like it was not. I'd
[27:39.030 --> 27:44.970]  have to re-sync it. You might just need to sign in again on your accounts. Probably. In mail
[27:44.970 --> 27:52.290]  accounts and settings. I was concerned that all of the emails I sent, because I tried to send
[27:52.290 --> 27:57.490]  those emails and it was like, ah, didn't go through, like, didn't work. Then I sent them
[27:57.490 --> 28:03.270]  on the browser. I was worried that if I ever fixed the mail thing, then all those emails would
[28:03.270 --> 28:07.990]  then get shot out a second time because. I mean, they all sat in your outbox because you could just
[28:07.990 --> 28:13.330]  delete them from there. Well, let's see. I'm opening my mail. But because of that, I haven't
[28:13.330 --> 28:20.030]  used the mail postage stamp thing in probably three years. So you've got all your emails from
[28:20.030 --> 28:25.770]  Rooster Teeth, but from three years ago. I yeah, I get. Well, I mean, I'm trying to open this thing
[28:25.770 --> 28:32.550]  and nothing is happening. I guess I haven't clicked it. He's talking about it like it's a physical box.
[28:32.850 --> 28:37.670]  Like I'm trying to open this thing and it's stuck. Blowing off the dust.
[28:39.190 --> 28:43.310]  Well, it was, you know, it was also a problem because I just at some point decided to stop
[28:43.310 --> 28:49.710]  deleting emails. So I have 30,000 emails that are unread currently, this thing.
[28:52.590 --> 28:56.550]  The last one I received was from 2020 December 11th.
[29:00.750 --> 29:04.650]  And there's a little squiggly line that looks like the Messenger app.
[29:05.370 --> 29:08.910]  Does present day you just hate future you?
[29:09.290 --> 29:12.750]  No, I'm good. I use the browser. I'm fine.
[29:13.690 --> 29:16.410]  Yeah, but doesn't don't you hate past you?
[29:16.790 --> 29:23.250]  No. I think there's no thought. I don't think that there's a thought of like linear time
[29:23.250 --> 29:27.290]  with like, I'm going to have to deal with this or why am I having to deal with this now?
[29:27.370 --> 29:33.190]  It is just simply this exists. I haven't received. I have 30,000 unread emails.
[29:33.710 --> 29:38.930]  Here's the thing with the emails. I was on top of it. I would delete them every time they'd show
[29:38.930 --> 29:44.070]  up. I click delete, get rid of. Why are you just deleting them? To get rid of them.
[29:44.470 --> 29:47.490]  Why do you want to get rid of them? Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
[29:47.830 --> 29:51.310]  I went back to an email that I got in 2012 because I needed it this week.
[29:51.510 --> 29:55.530]  I don't understand why you're deleting the emails in your inbox.
[29:55.690 --> 29:57.870]  You don't put them in your trash by deleting them.
[29:59.230 --> 30:04.050]  I'm not asking what it does. I'm asking why do you do it?
[30:04.310 --> 30:08.110]  Oh, that's what I'm... No. Okay. I'm trying to articulate. Isn't that what everyone does?
[30:08.190 --> 30:10.710]  Doesn't everyone delete? You read and then you delete it.
[30:11.050 --> 30:14.550]  I remember the last time I deleted an email is when I was using my Hotmail account
[30:15.430 --> 30:17.670]  in 2003 and then Gmail came out.
[30:17.770 --> 30:18.570]  Oh, people don't delete?
[30:18.610 --> 30:20.970]  And then no one ever had to delete an email ever again.
[30:21.850 --> 30:26.930]  So I was actively deleting, but then it felt like there's no end to this and I just gave up.
[30:26.930 --> 30:28.230]  That's why I have 30,000.
[30:29.470 --> 30:34.810]  I can't stop this wave. The damn head broke. I'm getting emails every day. I can't stop.
[30:34.810 --> 30:36.890]  Why is that? Why is that? Is that an issue?
[30:37.470 --> 30:38.230]  Yeah, what's the deal?
[30:38.490 --> 30:42.090]  It's because I was trying to stay on top of it and get them deleted.
[30:42.250 --> 30:47.590]  So it was like I was creating work for myself that would never end. There was no end to this job.
[30:47.890 --> 30:50.950]  Reading them is getting on top of them. Why does deleting them have to be on top of them?
[30:53.570 --> 30:59.030]  I haven't been on top of emails since about 2007, 2008 when I got a Gmail account.
[31:00.170 --> 31:04.150]  Enter the password for the account to authenticate.
[31:04.170 --> 31:06.050]  Jeff, are we nuts? Do you delete your emails?
[31:07.050 --> 31:14.670]  No, I have Gmail, so I don't need to really delete my emails unless it's, you know, obvious trash.
[31:15.270 --> 31:22.530]  All of it, though, is so there's no sort for my Safari letter email thing.
[31:24.530 --> 31:29.090]  So it's like PAX team. I'm not going to click that. I don't need to read about
[31:29.090 --> 31:34.110]  PAX in 2020. Twitch notification. I don't care about that. I'm not clicking that.
[31:34.390 --> 31:37.370]  I don't think anyone's saying you should go and read all your 2020 emails.
[31:38.030 --> 31:42.210]  No, I'm saying even when they came out at the time, go back to 2020. I don't need to read that.
[31:42.210 --> 31:44.480]  Are you explaining the concept of...
[31:50.780 --> 31:51.480]  What?
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.960]  I'm explaining what?
[31:55.640 --> 32:02.510]  I've been laughing so hard. I'm like losing my mind. This is...
[32:03.160 --> 32:06.440]  Why are you telling us what your emails are?
[32:07.020 --> 32:11.120]  Okay, here's what I've got. Say I've got six emails. Say six emails came in.
[32:11.120 --> 32:15.820]  A bunch of them is like mailing lists, maybe. It might be like an order confirmation. Maybe
[32:15.820 --> 32:20.940]  there's one email that I need to read and reply to. I'll just arrow through them, just like...
[32:21.920 --> 32:26.280]  Then I've dealt with all those. And then I'll reply to the one I want. And that's it. That's
[32:26.280 --> 32:31.520]  all I do. Yeah, but the little blue dot doesn't go away unless you click it. It's not true. What
[32:31.520 --> 32:36.560]  do you mean? The little blue dot doesn't go away unless you click it. Well, you click it, right?
[32:36.560 --> 32:41.840]  Then you just use the arrows and go up. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. And then they'll
[32:41.840 --> 32:49.300]  all not be blue. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Or just get used to the idea that the blue dot can exist.
[32:50.700 --> 32:57.260]  Yeah. It doesn't matter. This is my point. This is what I'm saying. Yes. So if I'm getting 50
[32:57.260 --> 33:02.320]  emails a day and I'm trying to keep that number low, I'm having to do the boop, boop, boop, boop,
[33:02.320 --> 33:08.920]  every day. And that's endless. That is an endless... I'm never done. I'm never finished.
[33:09.200 --> 33:15.900]  No, it sounds like it ends at 50. Oh, listen, 50. I'm doing it every day. I'm doing it 50 times a
[33:15.900 --> 33:20.480]  day. I don't want to do it 50 times a day. I mean, you can also block and mark stuff as spam
[33:20.480 --> 33:25.000]  and you can unsubscribe from a lot of... I don't get actually that many emails anymore.
[33:25.000 --> 33:33.640]  Neither do I. Let me tell you, my inbox in 2020 was popping off. It was going crazy with stuff
[33:33.640 --> 33:39.720]  I had no interest in reading. I can't authenticate this. So it's just a bunch of...
[33:41.440 --> 33:44.940]  You're not trying to log into Rooster Teeth now, are you? Because you can't.
[33:44.960 --> 33:49.500]  No, I'm trying to log into my personal. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[33:50.020 --> 33:55.600]  Uh. He's going to print the law by accident. This is going to do something. Oh, no, this is the...
[33:55.600 --> 33:58.340]  I talked about this before where it's broken. It just doesn't work.
[34:00.540 --> 34:06.020]  It's broken. It's broken. Yeah, see, you can't think. Sorry. This is not... Sorry. My point
[34:06.020 --> 34:12.800]  is emails. It's too many. I got too many. He hasn't been deleting them fast enough, so.
[34:13.020 --> 34:17.960]  But I don't need this Fitbit one from December 11th, 2020. Hey, that's fine.
[34:19.300 --> 34:25.460]  2020, December 11th. The source. It's official. Cyberpunk 2077 is finally here.
[34:25.760 --> 34:33.640]  You don't need to deal with it. Ignore it. I know I can't because it'll bother me.
[34:34.020 --> 34:38.340]  I either have. So I do ignore it. That's what I'm doing. All right. And then so say you've
[34:38.340 --> 34:41.820]  dealt with everything you need to. You've still got 30,000. Just do it. You know,
[34:41.820 --> 34:48.820]  Command A, markers red. Job done. Command A? Yeah, that will select everything. One second.
[34:50.660 --> 34:57.340]  This is going to be an old timer, isn't it? Like we're in the middle of an old time. I'm on. I'm
[34:57.340 --> 35:03.160]  using. OK, so I'm using a Windows keyboard on my Mac. How do I do command? OK, the button next to
[35:03.160 --> 35:10.640]  spacebar and A. Alt A. Yeah, nothing's happened. Oh, oh, the pin. It's pinwheeling.
[35:11.460 --> 35:17.220]  This whole thing's about to crash. Oh, Gavin, you just messed with the whole house of cards.
[35:17.340 --> 35:22.200]  It's about to crumble. This is like when Gavin mentioned that we weren't having any technical
[35:22.200 --> 35:28.800]  problems before we recorded our Let's Play this morning. What Let's Play? It's just 49 minutes
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.080]  later. We did. We gave up. We'll continue. I don't want to hog the whole show with this stuff.
[35:34.160 --> 35:38.340]  So, you know, buddy, you're not hogging it. Don't worry. Well, going back to the chair,
[35:38.420 --> 35:44.120]  is that four chairs in four Septembers now? Yes. Or is it three? Yeah. Uh, one a year.
[35:44.660 --> 35:51.980]  One, two, three. Yeah. Four. Four. Chair five is coming. OK. So is chair five a different chair?
[35:52.300 --> 35:57.660]  Yes. You didn't just. Well, I mean, the warranty on a Herman Miller's got to be
[35:57.660 --> 36:02.120]  several years. Yeah, but he's got to find the fucking paper. I don't have any of the forms that
[36:02.120 --> 36:09.640]  prove that I have this legally. Yeah, I guess you were given it. Yeah, you might be S.O.L.
[36:09.960 --> 36:16.160]  I'm sure they'll just help you, though. You would think. I don't know. I'll keep it updated on that.
[36:16.280 --> 36:21.020]  I don't even have the email, the person that I originally talked to. Right. Isn't that what
[36:21.020 --> 36:26.020]  got us talking about all this stuff? Are you OK? No, I'm saying I don't have the address.
[36:26.020 --> 36:33.080]  Like I thought about reaching out on my new email or my old my personal email. I don't know how to
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.900]  find them. Do you have an old phone that downloaded your email? Do you have like this? The hot dog
[36:38.900 --> 36:46.460]  phone have email? They all have email. So you might have the time capsule of that inbox still on one
[36:46.460 --> 36:53.220]  of those phones. Huh? I still have all those phones. Unless you were using the browser on the phone as
[36:53.220 --> 36:58.980]  well. No, I was always using the app on the phone. OK, well, then Gavin might have solved
[36:58.980 --> 37:06.520]  your problem right there. Maybe I take all of my I take all of my broken phones to like an I fix it
[37:06.520 --> 37:13.600]  like a repair place and see if they can fix all my phones simultaneously. I wonder what effect I
[37:13.600 --> 37:20.340]  really want to spend the whole day just watching you. I have to do it. I need to see all the weird
[37:20.340 --> 37:27.320]  shit you do. You find a you find like a day one problem and band-aid it. And then by day 90,
[37:27.400 --> 37:36.100]  you've got a stack of band-aids. And on day 365, they explode. I mean, yeah, that's fair.
[37:36.600 --> 37:42.480]  Shoot across the room. I like your phone idea. I'm going to explore that. I'm going to explore
[37:42.480 --> 37:47.400]  the chair thing. Hopefully the new chair is good. I just want a chair. I just want a chair
[37:47.400 --> 37:54.560]  that doesn't explode. Or if it does happen on camera. Yeah, we just have to build a better
[37:54.560 --> 38:08.660]  band-aid. So that's my chair update. I. I got a I got a I fulfilled a request by you, Gavin.
[38:09.840 --> 38:16.740]  I just still can't believe that the only time you tried to learn the chair was like after a year and
[38:16.740 --> 38:22.680]  you put it on the bed. We were so excited for you to learn the chair right when you got it.
[38:23.300 --> 38:27.840]  Were you conscious that it was September and you were closing in on a year? Were you like,
[38:27.880 --> 38:31.740]  were you like, I'm this, I'm fucking close to beating the record? No, I'm going to be honest.
[38:31.820 --> 38:36.220]  I didn't even know there was a September pattern. Didn't occur to me. I feel like we've talked about
[38:36.220 --> 38:40.740]  it in the past a lot. Yeah, it's just I don't. When Gavin brought it up, when I said I broke
[38:40.740 --> 38:44.340]  it on the Slack channel and Gavin brought up the September thing, I went, OK, I guess that's
[38:44.340 --> 38:50.820]  the thing. Who can remember yesterday? I totally am right there with you. I got a nipple review
[38:50.820 --> 38:58.480]  for Gavin. Oh, Eddie Murphy. Eddie Eddie Murphy's nipple review. Let me find my specific notes,
[38:58.540 --> 39:03.660]  because as you may remember, this was a conversation that I didn't my mom didn't
[39:03.660 --> 39:08.880]  know that I had talked about on the show. Yeah. How did you get around that? I just had to come
[39:08.880 --> 39:16.280]  out, be honest about it. Try to figure out where I wrote it down. It it is probably the most I've
[39:16.280 --> 39:23.360]  ever wished I recorded a conversation in my life. We're learning that that was a public opinion
[39:23.360 --> 39:30.040]  that was known. I'll just give you the current review of the Eddie Murphy thing.
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.040]  I showed her the photo that you sent of Eddie Murphy's nipples, and her initial response was
[39:35.040 --> 39:42.380]  that's photoshopped. And then I said, no, I don't think it is. And she had to enhance,
[39:42.620 --> 39:49.600]  but she didn't have her glasses on when I showed her. And she said they were twisted, it appeared,
[39:49.720 --> 39:57.020]  and understood your take that they were weird nipples. So she's with you. Full support of the
[39:57.020 --> 40:00.900]  weird nipples. I didn't I don't think I said they were weird. I said they were small. I thought the
[40:00.900 --> 40:05.880]  point was they were strange. Doesn't matter. Anyway, that was the review. She thinks they're
[40:07.260 --> 40:13.860]  the learning. So it was an immediate when I told her that I said that it was an immediate
[40:13.860 --> 40:21.740]  embarrassment was the reaction. What is it like the seven stages of whatever we really ran through
[40:21.740 --> 40:28.100]  the emotional spectrum? It was initially complete embarrassment that this was a thing that people
[40:28.100 --> 40:36.620]  knew that she thought. Then denial. Then it was a well, what was the consensus from everybody else
[40:37.360 --> 40:47.160]  and me explaining that it was not shared the opinion that she had to then rage that and
[40:47.160 --> 40:54.920]  disbelief. Rage. That rage might be a strong word, but disbelief that this was an opinion that was
[40:54.920 --> 41:03.360]  not universally shared based off of what was done and a declarative statement that if y'all
[41:03.360 --> 41:07.400]  think that's what normal nipples look like, you don't you've never seen a normal nipple in your
[41:07.400 --> 41:16.000]  life, I believe was I'm paraphrasing. I don't have direct notes and that she is a much better
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.320]  authority on nipples as somebody who has worked in a medicinal medical field in which she had to
[41:23.320 --> 41:33.840]  see them all the time. She then asked, so did we all look from that movie? And I said, I don't
[41:33.840 --> 41:39.100]  remember. I don't think so. I think it was just what was available when you searched it, to which
[41:39.100 --> 41:46.720]  she then countered that that is a key point of this belief. She thinks that it has to be specifically
[41:46.720 --> 41:55.200]  from this film, the imagery, and that she is uncomfortable declaring any other versions of
[41:55.200 --> 42:02.140]  the nipples being weird. So we need to see them in motion specifically. She said it that her belief
[42:02.140 --> 42:09.560]  is that the nipples in the past may be normal, but that child having a child impacted the nipples.
[42:10.800 --> 42:18.640]  This is what post childbirth nipples was the statement. So that's where we're at with the
[42:18.640 --> 42:26.360]  nipple review. Huh? She wants everyone to see the movie. Has she had a child? She has. Oh, yeah.
[42:27.180 --> 42:34.520]  Has she mentioned any changes to her nipples in? I don't know. I haven't looked, so I don't know.
[42:35.140 --> 42:42.300]  I can't say, but it is the most. Oh, man, it was a crazy conversation to have over the phone. It
[42:42.300 --> 42:46.680]  was very funny. There was a guy on one of the British seasons of Love Island who had to have
[42:46.680 --> 42:55.280]  nipple surgery. Why? His nipples were weird. I never really explained why they had to be moved.
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.920]  They never clarified. So he never you never saw them? No, they're just they look a little weird.
[43:00.920 --> 43:04.760]  And then you find out somewhere through the idea that he did have some sort of a cosmetic surgery.
[43:05.600 --> 43:09.100]  It'll be on a season you'll watch at some point. He's still together with the lady.
[43:09.660 --> 43:16.100]  I need to run this by my mom. I think people would want to do like maybe it's like a Falcon thing,
[43:16.380 --> 43:20.840]  a Q&A that my mom does. Like people could write questions to her to answer.
[43:21.240 --> 43:26.060]  Oh, so good. I think they would absolutely love to. Would your mother enjoy that, though?
[43:26.580 --> 43:29.240]  That would be the thing. I don't know. I'd have to talk to her about it.
[43:29.800 --> 43:34.380]  I don't know. It definitely would be a thing she'd be nervous about, but I don't think she'd
[43:34.380 --> 43:39.180]  mind answering the questions. It's the idea of it being reported either hurdle. But I feel like
[43:39.180 --> 43:45.940]  people would be interested. Yeah, I want to I want to submit. Did we kill Taggart from Beverly Hills
[43:45.940 --> 43:52.900]  Cop? Probably. Yeah, I definitely talked about him. Here's the thing. Never mind, I'm not going
[43:52.900 --> 44:02.860]  to say that. I'm not going to. Oh, man. Go ahead and say it. I was going to say and the reason why
[44:02.860 --> 44:07.220]  I didn't say it is not because it's offensive. It's just I don't think it's true. I was going to
[44:07.220 --> 44:12.580]  say they showed that you could make a good one without him so they could keep going. But I don't
[44:12.580 --> 44:18.140]  think Beverly Hills Cop three is a good it's a bad movie. But it's still your it's still your
[44:18.140 --> 44:22.460]  favorite one. It's not my favorite one. The first is the best. The first is my favorite. The third
[44:22.460 --> 44:27.520]  had the best action. And it was the point that I was making. That is an opinion you've backed
[44:27.520 --> 44:34.260]  yourself into believing. It is. Well, no, it's I believed it. And I don't know how to back out of
[44:34.260 --> 44:41.120]  it, I guess. I will die in the hill that Beverly Hills Cop three is the best action. Your earbud

[45:11.360 --> 45:14.380]  to the holiday season, Eric mentioned we're going to have a Gerbler on the store soon.
[45:14.380 --> 45:19.560]  I got something in the mail yesterday. Amazon is fucking diabolical.
[45:19.900 --> 45:23.520]  What did Amazon do? Have you guys gotten this? Let me send you the text.
[45:24.240 --> 45:29.800]  Uh, discord. Have you guys received in the mail to current resident? By the way, it wasn't to me
[45:29.800 --> 45:40.660]  specifically. They sent me unprompted a kid's Christmas toy catalog. Oh, hell yeah. With like
[45:40.660 --> 45:47.340]  fill out the toys you want right here. Hell yeah. Circle the ones that are for you. I'm so jealous.
[45:47.720 --> 45:55.440]  They're bringing it back, dude. No way. Oh, man. Oh, over 700 toys and gifts? Yeah,
[45:55.600 --> 46:00.000]  including the page that I sent you just happens to have a very similar looking remote control
[46:00.540 --> 46:07.380]  truck to my shark. That's so cool. Did you go through the whole book? I couldn't because Emily
[46:07.380 --> 46:10.240]  took it immediately and went and sat down and went through the whole book herself.
[46:10.660 --> 46:15.720]  She decided which Hot Wheels car she's going to get. I think she circled some Barbie stuff. No,
[46:15.820 --> 46:19.460]  I just I was I was fucking wild to get that in the mail. I'm like, what is this? And then I went,
[46:19.580 --> 46:25.780]  oh, my God, that's awesome. It's very smart of them. Very devious. It is. It is super devious.
[46:26.280 --> 46:32.240]  All the waste, though. Mm hmm. I feel like they fixed the catalog problem by
[46:32.900 --> 46:37.120]  inventing websites. Also, my kid doesn't live at home anymore. She's off to college, so it's used.
[46:40.140 --> 46:47.340]  I the waste thing. It's you're right. It is a waste. I I fucking hate paper straws.
[46:47.580 --> 46:51.820]  That's what it comes down to. Paper straws are dog shit. It's a terrible replacement for plastic.
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.000]  I agree. I also don't think that these catalogs are a waste.
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.760]  I like my wife definitely got her are no money's worth out of it last night. She spent 45 minutes.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.900]  I don't think these are a waste at all. You don't think unsolicited mail is a waste?
[47:04.900 --> 47:12.020]  Did I? I think unsolicited mail in general is a waste. Do I think this is a waste? No, I don't.
[47:12.100 --> 47:16.440]  No. So you think most people will read it? I think that there will be a lot of people that
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.280]  do go through it for the nostalgia kick and kids will go through it. I do not think it is a waste.
[47:20.620 --> 47:25.140]  If it had video games and stuff in it and it's skewed a little older, I would recommend we do
[47:25.140 --> 47:32.380]  it as a piece of supplemental to kind of replace the summer than 98 catalog we did. But it stays
[47:32.380 --> 47:38.880]  pretty young. That's too bad. Yeah. Otherwise, I think it'd be fun to do. But it'd be like it'd
[47:38.880 --> 47:42.920]  be like Fisher Price shit. You know, I would love to buy all the toys I couldn't afford as a kid.
[47:43.420 --> 47:49.680]  Yes. The problem is nostalgia is expensive is when I've looked at at doing that type of thing.
[47:49.940 --> 47:55.000]  Yeah, I think if it was the actual stuff I couldn't afford as a kid, it would I still
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.480]  couldn't get it because it'd be ridiculous. It's so funny you say that. I was thinking
[47:58.480 --> 48:02.920]  the other day that if I had all the money in the world, all I would want to do and I'd have to
[48:02.920 --> 48:09.880]  figure out how to work it out with Emily. All I would want to do is have a like perfect one to one
[48:09.880 --> 48:15.160]  recreation of Ricky Schroeder's bedroom from Silver Spoons, which is a show is probably a little too
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.760]  old for you guys. But he was rich and he had a race car bed and he had like all the coolest toys.
[48:20.880 --> 48:27.380]  It was kind of like the TV version of that Richard Pryor movie. And it was I would love to sleep in
[48:27.380 --> 48:30.960]  a race car bed for the rest of my life if I could do it in that bedroom.
[48:33.420 --> 48:38.300]  Oh, that's a pretty cool looking room. Yes. You got the race car bed in the back,
[48:38.340 --> 48:42.100]  and it's a race wall behind him. He had a dad who loved him, too, which was wild.
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.960]  It was so there was so much I liked about that show.
[48:47.420 --> 48:55.700]  I for me, when I look at toys now, I have I have this weird gap of none of the nostalgia stuff
[48:55.700 --> 49:01.540]  is is things that I care about or properties I care about. I don't care about Star Wars. I'm not
[49:01.540 --> 49:06.160]  a big Marvel guy. Like, it's fine. I don't mind Marvel. It's just it's not. I wasn't into that
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.740]  as a kid. I was in this weird time period where I don't feel like there's a big Teenage Mutant
[49:11.740 --> 49:16.140]  Ninja Turtles show on. So that feels like a thing I should love because as an adult, I'm like,
[49:16.200 --> 49:21.140]  that's really cool. I like all the visuals of it, but I just wasn't exposed to it as a kid.
[49:21.880 --> 49:28.000]  Jurassic Park sucks in its current iteration, like all of the like kind of popular kids brands now
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.700]  either don't have nostalgia for or it's a version of it that I don't think is good.
[49:33.420 --> 49:38.060]  I wish it was like, oh, why wasn't Small Soldiers a series that kept going?
[49:38.320 --> 49:42.360]  There should be more of those. I want to buy Gorgonite toys in 2024.
[49:42.860 --> 49:48.260]  That's really sad, Andrew. I feel bad for you. But I also think that they just ruin nostalgia.
[49:48.260 --> 49:52.200]  I grew up with Star Wars and I couldn't give a shit about Star Wars anymore.
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.300]  I grew up, I had, I humped 10,000 comic books around with me everywhere I moved until I was
[49:57.300 --> 50:02.140]  like 30. And now you couldn't pay me to read a comic book. All that stuff has been so overdone
[50:02.140 --> 50:09.940]  and just so beaten to death that it's all ruined for me. And it makes me not look back at it as
[50:09.940 --> 50:13.940]  well. Like there was a long time I could look back and be like, well, I still like Empire Strikes
[50:13.940 --> 50:17.820]  Back. I still think it's like the coolest movie. But even now, I just, when I look back on like
[50:17.820 --> 50:23.060]  where I would find nostalgia, I just try to find other TV shows or movies to explore because it's
[50:23.060 --> 50:29.800]  just all been just spoiled with excess. It's also interesting how technology moving forward
[50:29.800 --> 50:36.120]  means that the stuff I would have given a nut for is of absolutely no interest. Like when I was 10,
[50:36.200 --> 50:42.860]  would have freaking loved a Game Boy Camera. Holy shit. Would have loved one. Now I wouldn't pay a
[50:42.860 --> 50:49.360]  dollar for one. Yeah. What would be the point? The Game Boy Camera was just photos, right?
[50:49.880 --> 50:58.760]  I think so. On like a 144p screen. It was like a fax machine almost. I haven't been able to figure
[50:58.760 --> 51:03.740]  out what it would be, but I think it's really funny the idea of us trying to use the camera
[51:03.740 --> 51:09.880]  for some supplemental in some form. What if we do a let's play and all of our face cams are the
[51:09.880 --> 51:16.940]  Game Boy Camera? That's really funny. And nostalgia, I don't know. Do you have any
[51:16.940 --> 51:21.440]  nostalgia that hasn't been ruined or that you do you still think like that you still think fondly
[51:21.440 --> 51:25.940]  of even if you don't like connect super strong with it? It's stuff that is like not available
[51:25.940 --> 51:32.820]  now. So I think about like, oh man, if I had money as a child and they were still around like
[51:32.820 --> 51:37.760]  the Turbo Man dolls, like when they made toys for Jingle all the way, those were awesome.
[51:37.760 --> 51:43.360]  The small soldiers thing is another one where it's like, oh, that stuff is cool. I go back and
[51:43.360 --> 51:50.200]  I look at the boxes for it. Those are the main ones. Did you read a lot as a kid at all? Not
[51:50.200 --> 51:56.560]  really. More into like when I think of the action figures I collected, and it's weird because I'm
[51:56.560 --> 52:00.540]  not a big Lord of the Rings fan, but I ended up with a lot of Lord of the Rings action figures
[52:00.540 --> 52:05.880]  that were fun. I had the lost action figures, which were not fun, but like I was that's how
[52:05.880 --> 52:11.860]  deep I was in the lost. John Locke looking at the hatch. Remember the magazine for Lost? I was
[52:11.860 --> 52:19.020]  a subscriber to Lost the magazine. I wanted that universe to continue so badly as an expanded
[52:19.020 --> 52:24.800]  universe with novels and stuff. And I just just floundered. It was a shame. It did. There was so
[52:24.800 --> 52:29.840]  much there was so much intrigue and interest and possibility in there. And it was ultimately didn't
[52:29.840 --> 52:33.340]  really go anywhere, unfortunately. But I was ready for it, man. Like we talked about it in the past,
[52:33.340 --> 52:37.300]  but I loved that video game Viadomus because I just liked seeing different parts of the island
[52:37.300 --> 52:43.320]  and you could see how stuff fit together, you know? Oh, is that a good game? I mean, it was a free roam
[52:43.320 --> 52:48.300]  kind. No, not really. But you could explore the island. You know, we should do a little
[52:48.300 --> 52:53.340]  watch a little bit. We watch it. Oh, it's I have it. Oh, we're going to do that. I bought it.
[52:55.340 --> 53:00.720]  We are going. It's so funny, the actors that they got for their actual voices and who they missed
[53:00.720 --> 53:07.660]  out on, because now I think that entire cast, for the most part, they are not big names like
[53:07.660 --> 53:13.280]  they would not be. They're available. But at that time they were they were out of the price range.
[53:13.300 --> 53:20.620]  So there's no Matthew Fox. There's no Terry O'Quinn. There is it is like a son is in it and
[53:20.620 --> 53:26.040]  it's all background kind of side characters. Do you think now they're like, hey, can I
[53:26.040 --> 53:33.900]  rerecord lines for that? Absolutely. I speaking of like toys and stuff,
[53:35.080 --> 53:41.600]  nostalgia, I have gone through a kind of odd process of I've been on a rocky kick because
[53:41.600 --> 53:48.360]  I somehow avoided all of those films. Avoid, I guess. I don't know. I wasn't alive for most of
[53:48.360 --> 53:53.520]  them. I remember seeing Rocky Balboa in theaters thinking this is crazy that I'm seeing a rocky
[53:53.520 --> 54:01.520]  movie with Stallone in a movie theater. I've watched the old ones because they were I got a
[54:01.520 --> 54:07.000]  notification on Prime saying we are going to stop carrying these in like four days. I thought, oh,
[54:07.020 --> 54:11.440]  fuck, I've been meaning to see those. I guess let's just watch them nonstop. I've been in high
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.960]  rocky kick, watched all of them outside of Rocky five. It has led me. I'm going to share my screen
[54:16.960 --> 54:20.460]  you guys for a minute, because this is an important question.
[54:22.380 --> 54:29.760]  I think that Sylvester Stallone is the greatest sprinting action star of all time. He's the best
[54:29.760 --> 54:34.820]  run I think of any action star. Better than Steven Seagal? Better than Tom Cruise?
[54:34.820 --> 54:41.760]  Better than Tom Cruise. Sylvester Stallone running is one of the most visually impressive
[54:41.760 --> 54:48.800]  things I've seen in an action movie. It is so absurd. The first film gave me this thought of
[54:48.800 --> 54:53.480]  like, wow, there is a scene in the first movie where he is running and he's in shape now and
[54:53.480 --> 54:58.060]  he's like booking it. And then he turns it up another gear and that man really hooves it.
[54:59.160 --> 55:07.780]  And it is solidified to me. Let me find. Here we go. In Rocky three. Oh, yeah. He's running.
[55:08.340 --> 55:13.420]  He's running on the beach. I'll just do I'm hitting play. You guys are all watching.
[55:13.540 --> 55:19.600]  So they're going. They're sprinting. Figuring things out. Look at Carl Lewis.
[55:22.140 --> 55:28.580]  Stallone is going so fast. He looks like he's going to just break down his whole body.
[55:28.980 --> 55:34.700]  Love this. Look at all the sinew in the muscle and everything. So jacked and just running.
[55:34.700 --> 55:40.300]  This is so awesome. This head. This is the head bobbing. He looks like the
[55:40.300 --> 55:45.220]  wheels are about to fall off. He's going so fast. His neck can barely take it.
[55:46.660 --> 55:54.760]  These are these are my heroes. Yeah. Yeah. And we ran together. We did it. We ran real far.
[55:55.340 --> 56:01.160]  Yay. It's just going back. Just it's it looks like he's in one of those
[56:01.160 --> 56:06.900]  G-Force chairs. Yeah. Just look at his face. Look at that. He's just running.
[56:08.240 --> 56:13.480]  It looks like he's going to die. So I'd love to know, do you guys have any actors that you
[56:13.480 --> 56:20.340]  think of like iconic runs? I think we already said them. Well, yeah, it's Rocky two. Rocky
[56:20.340 --> 56:26.800]  two. He has a run in Rocky two where he's I mean, yeah. Oh, the the steps. Yeah.
[56:26.800 --> 56:36.020]  Runs up the fucking steps. Where he where he's doing. It's this. Oh, hold on here. I'll just
[56:36.020 --> 56:40.160]  go to this part here. Oh, this might be what I was thinking. See, I watch Rocky one and two back
[56:40.160 --> 56:44.940]  to back where he picks it up. He's going. Yeah. Everyone's there with him. And then he goes.
[56:45.360 --> 56:51.600]  Yes. That is what I was thinking. I thought this was in one. That's what I think. Yeah. He's just
[56:51.600 --> 56:59.220]  dude. He's just got that rock so hard. The way he just runs that fast is so fucking cool to me.
[56:59.220 --> 57:04.460]  Like he's just giving it everything. That's so awesome. Look at that shot. Oh, my God.
[57:05.100 --> 57:11.200]  God, it's so awesome. Rocky two is awesome. First three are great. First four are great.
[57:11.880 --> 57:18.120]  Should we grab a slow-mo camera and recreate the beast shot with each of us doing it? Please.
[57:18.120 --> 57:25.200]  I want to see a full-on sprint. I promise you I will throw up. I was going to say the same thing.
[57:25.520 --> 57:33.300]  I mean, yeah, if we want to puke, sure, absolutely. I'll throw up. 20 seconds. I'll do it. I'll throw
[57:36.110 --> 57:41.310]  up. Nick, you're the most athletic here. We've gone over this. You got the best movement. I'd
[57:41.310 --> 57:44.370]  love to see you full tilt. 20 seconds of Nick's sprint.
[57:49.670 --> 57:54.630]  So hard to convince. I can't wait. I had to talk to my neighbors a few weeks ago.
[57:55.250 --> 57:57.510]  Oh, no. That must have been really difficult for you. Yeah.
[57:58.850 --> 58:01.810]  They're like, why are you shaving with a broken penis?
[58:04.670 --> 58:11.430]  No, one of my neighbors walked up and said, are you okay? Why do you think that might have been
[58:11.430 --> 58:20.510]  Eric? I don't know. I just assumed you were in the backyard, uh, like shaving, but I, you know,
[58:20.630 --> 58:25.530]  we already kind of hit on that. I can't think of why else they would ask if you were okay.
[58:25.930 --> 58:29.690]  Do you think maybe it would have something to do with the fact that after you gave me a ride home,
[58:29.790 --> 58:33.410]  you drove your car into my legs and I fell into my bins?
[58:33.410 --> 58:41.670]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[58:46.610 --> 58:52.950]  What? Yeah, I forgot about that. You hit Gavin with a car? Well, he just pretended to run me
[58:52.950 --> 58:56.950]  over a little bit. And then when I was pinned against the bins, he just kept going. I just
[58:56.950 --> 59:02.030]  kind of kept going. He's like, oh, you're already pinned. And I went, yep. And we're going to keep
[59:02.030 --> 59:05.970]  it going. And so it was a pretty good time. We're having fun. A couple of guys hanging out,
[59:06.070 --> 59:10.390]  hitting each other with cars. I thought it was pretty funny. It must have looked pretty strange
[59:10.390 --> 59:17.750]  from an external perspective. Hey, did your friend just run you over? Are you okay? Yeah,
[59:17.770 --> 59:21.150]  I was about to run these cucumbers over and I saw the strangest thing.
[59:24.670 --> 59:27.850]  Oh man. Good times. Oh, that's crazy. That's so funny.
[59:30.710 --> 59:35.390]  Did you guys see the pillows that they made for the Nintendo Museum?
[59:36.190 --> 59:42.050]  Excuse me? Of the controllers? Oh, the N64 controllers? Yeah, let me post a photo of.
[59:42.630 --> 59:45.650]  Also, before we wrap up, should we talk about how fucking stupid we all are?
[59:46.290 --> 59:52.770]  Yeah. About what? Well, a certain tech support situation we got ourselves into before this
[59:52.770 --> 01:00:00.970]  podcast. Oh, yeah, we do that. Yeah. So, Jeff, they made this, the N64, and then they did a
[01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:06.910]  Wiimote one. There's a bunch of them. Look at how dumb these fucking... they're giant controllers
[01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:12.170]  that are pillows. It made me think, if you could turn anything in your house, any item
[01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:17.050]  into a pillow, what would you want it to be? What would you want as a pillow?
[01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:27.290]  Oh. Dutch oven. Oh, yeah. Crawl into it. Be all cozy. Maybe I'm nuts. Have we not
[01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.490]  talked about this before? I don't think so. Sleep spaghetti is what we were talking about before.
[01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:36.490]  Okay. Yeah, I think it would be something that could be completely enclosed and I
[01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:40.730]  could get on the inside of. I think an oven's great. Oven is a really good one.
[01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:49.630]  What about a fridge? It's upright, isn't it? A coffin? A car pillow?
[01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:53.530]  Maybe a nice big recycling bin pillow. How about a toilet?
[01:00:55.750 --> 01:01:05.410]  Could you sit on it without it collapsing in? No, no. I think I would go with, like, a Gerpler.
[01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:11.290]  I think I would go with a cup because that would be the most convenient. Imagine that it's not like
[01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:19.110]  the middle isn't stuffed. It's just a pillow in the shape fully of like a cup. So it could
[01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:25.930]  potentially hold stuff, but it's just a cup pillow. I think a knife would be cool. You
[01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:32.810]  throw it at people and they'd be like... I want the, is it cake trend, but it's pillows.
[01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:36.730]  I think the toilet is dangerous, though, because I wouldn't want something that I could accidentally
[01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:42.830]  shit in if I wasn't paying attention. You wake up tired and go for a piss. I mean, if you're Jeff,
[01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:47.670]  that's most things, right? Yeah. Did you ever do a thing as a kid where you piss in a bin or
[01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:53.190]  something because you just like, you're out of it? Yeah. Yeah. I've pissed on a toilet seat that
[01:01:53.690 --> 01:02:01.630]  had the lid on it before. I threw up on one of those. I once pissed on a toilet that not only
[01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:11.170]  had the lid down on it, I had my iPad on top of it. It was disastrous. That was an all time bad
[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:17.790]  one. You pissed on your iPad? Yeah, it was the middle of the night and I was really groggy and
[01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:24.150]  I walked into the bathroom. I started peeing and I could tell immediately. And I went down to
[01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:31.530]  quickly lift the lid and then I felt the tablet. And it was just bad. So did you even lift up the
[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:36.210]  iPad or did you just piss right on it? No, I pissed on the... it was face down. So I pissed on
[01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:41.850]  the metal back of the iPad and then it splattered and the seat was down. I just thought it was the
[01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:45.830]  seat was up. Who would have thought that you would have reclaimed piss boy from me in the
[01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:51.650]  same episode that I took it? Yeah, really, really crazy, dude. Way to go, Andrew. Fascinating to
[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:57.450]  watch the piss baton change hands like that. Here's a question for you. Do you think storing
[01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:04.170]  stuff on the toilet is maybe a bad idea? I think. Well, listen, there are negatives
[01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:11.390]  to it for sure. I think I was in I think I had a bath and I was probably using the tablet in the
[01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:17.650]  bath and put it on the toilet seat when I got out of the bath and then just left it there. He you
[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:24.470]  just there's negatives for sure. No mention of any positives whatsoever. Just I put it I had to put
[01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:30.150]  it somewhere. The positive is that it's a close surface. It is. It's always within reach,
[01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:34.310]  generally. But there's poo and you touch the iPad with your fingers and there's poo there.
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:38.390]  It's going to be the grossest iPad. That's piss on the back of it. The lid, the seat,
[01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:47.190]  the top of the piss on the front of it now. Yeah. The part that the so you put a lid down on a
[01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:53.810]  toilet and there's an upper part of it that is completely uninvolved in anything like the tank,
[01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:59.750]  the cistern. Yeah, like, well. Are you talking about a bit where you used to keep your headphones?
[01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:07.150]  No. With all the toilet paper crust. OK, so it's ceramic bowl, then there's seat,
[01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:15.550]  then there's lid and the lid has a top and a bottom. The bottom is facing water. That's
[01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:23.090]  the danger zone. The top is fine. The top is. Where's the top getting hit?
[01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:28.190]  When the top's open and you flush the toilet and all the fecal particles go flying. No, you close
[01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:35.530]  the lid. So you only flush a closed toilet? Yeah. Isn't that the point? I mean, I think a lot of
[01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:40.890]  people flush with it open. Yeah. I'm not a lot of people. I'm not worried about what a lot of
[01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:52.470]  people are doing. I close the lid and I flush. I would maybe argue that I make more of an effort
[01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:59.930]  to keep that upper area secure as somebody who places an iPad on it. Also like phone. What about
[01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:03.670]  your phone? You're spitting in your phone. You're talking on it. You're touching it with your hand.
[01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:08.310]  You're putting my phone in my butt. All of this shit is gross. No, my point is all this shit is
[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:14.050]  gross. When you get down to it, it's all disgusting. He's not wrong. When you're wiping
[01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:20.950]  your ass, right? The seat's up. There's bits of poo and tiny poo particles going all over the place
[01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:27.750]  and it's getting on the seat. You know what though, Gavin? To defend Andrew a little bit here,
[01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:32.290]  you're guilty of doing one of the grossest things that I think a human can do. And I don't know if
[01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:35.670]  you still do it, but you used to do it all the time and it drove me crazy. You run around with
[01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:43.190]  untied shoelaces. Those shoelaces just flop around on the ground. They would get stepped on. In the
[01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:49.150]  past, I have seen you walk around with untied shoelaces tons in your old Converse back in the
[01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:55.130]  day. Uh, like if I'm just like, I wouldn't leave the house with untied shoelaces. I've seen it.
[01:05:55.250 --> 01:06:00.250]  I've seen it already. And that's extra icky. No, that's gross. Cause then you got to touch him.
[01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:04.190]  I wouldn't. And they touch the ground and the ground is where poop and pee is. Yeah. Look at
[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:10.990]  who is the gross guy. How the tables have turned. I haven't had shoelaces for like 10 years. I'm
[01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:20.110]  just saying. My cats eat them, so I had to go with elastic. The tablet is the worst thing I've pissed
[01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:26.650]  on though. By far. Most regrettable. Did you save it or was that it? No, it was fine. It was fine.
[01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:36.570]  Wash it off. All good. Never dropped a phone in the toilet. It's been close. You don't need to
[01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:45.070]  when you piss all over it outside. That's, hey, you're right. Right about that. Wow. This is a
[01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:53.210]  lot of fun. Just wrap up. We're done. This is over. We did it. It's over. Oh my God. At some
[01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:57.430]  point in there, we had an episode. It was probably pretty good. Maybe it wasn't. I don't know. I will
[01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:04.530]  say that we spent 49 minutes trying to troubleshoot a problem on Eric's computer today that was related
[01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:09.610]  to us being able to hear something that we shouldn't have been able to hear. Okay, so when
[01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:15.050]  you say it like that, that's fucking crazy. Instead of saying we could hear ourselves because we were
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:21.350]  watching his screen through Discord, instead of saying it like you listen to porn on my computer
[01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:28.490]  somehow, you set that up in such a weird way. You set that up so nefariously. What's wrong with you?
[01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:33.530]  There was nothing nefarious about it. It was absolutely nefarious. I don't think Gavin,
[01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:43.390]  did that sound nefarious to you? What? Where did Gavin go? Did we lose Gavin?
[01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:49.510]  Gavin? That might be it. What a time to throw to Gavin. Anyway, the point is we're all extra
[01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:54.290]  fucking dumb. That wasn't what my note in my phone was about. I still don't know why I'm real dumb,
[01:07:54.410 --> 01:08:00.190]  but one of the reasons we're all real dumb is because we were trying to troubleshoot a problem
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:05.370]  that we were creating in the process of troubleshooting it. And so,
[01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:12.950]  real stupid. Real stupid bunch of dummies. So if you're a Roadcaster Duo expert, let me know.
[01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:20.530]  Thanks for listening, guys. Check out Regulatron.com, check out the Regulation Pod on Patreon,
[01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.530]  check out our video game videos, check out everything we got going on right now, and check
[01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:29.470]  out the Gerpler on sale probably in like late November. Gerple Friday. Gerp Friday.
[01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:35.230]  When are we announcing the store? Where the fuck have you been? Yeah, what the fuck are you talking
[01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:39.930]  about? We've been like trying to throw to you and you've just like nothing. Oh yeah, I had to piss.
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:46.170]  Sometimes I go for a quick... What, on an iPad? I didn't piss on the iPad. But chances are if I sit
[01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:50.030]  down to piss, because that's how I do it, someone will say my name and then I've got to yell.
[01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:56.350]  Wow. Good work. How many times have you pissed without us noticing throughout the history of
[01:08:56.350 --> 01:09:03.710]  this show? Probably nine. I don't think I've ever done it. That's insane. Has anybody else done that?
[01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:09.530]  No. It's mainly because while we were troubleshooting Eric's thing for no reason
[01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:14.310]  I just kept drinking. So I think it's really exciting that Gavin got the piss
[01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:18.410]  boy thing at the very beginning handed back the baton to Andrew and then we're ending it with
[01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:22.770]  piss rat Gavin. Thank you guys so much for listening to the podcast. We will see you next
[01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:28.550]  time. Have a good one. Bye. Wait, I can open my connection doctor on my email. Let's get a doctor
[01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:38.200]  in on this. First practice is almost here. Gear up on budget when you shop quality used sports
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.760]  equipment and play it again sports. Plus get paid on the spot for outgrown items. It's the
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:50.280]  sustainable way to shop and sell for football, soccer, golf, hockey, and more. Play it again sports.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.960]  Your back to school go-to.
