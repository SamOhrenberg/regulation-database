[00:49.240 --> 00:55.960]  Hello and welcome to another 31-themed supplemental today. Well, first of all,
[00:55.960 --> 01:02.300]  I'm hosting this thing. My name is Andrew, and I'm joined by Nick, Eric, Jeff, and Gavin.
[01:02.540 --> 01:08.100]  How's everyone doing? Good, thanks. Great. Is that why we're doing this? It's the 31-themed thing?
[01:08.560 --> 01:14.320]  It is 31. Well, listen, this is why we're doing this, OK? Because we're hot on 31 as a number
[01:14.320 --> 01:21.100]  recently. We're doing dogs and cream. We are. We did zombies. That was trying to hit 31.
[01:21.660 --> 01:28.820]  And I am so sick of Christmas, of the diehard conversation of, is it a Christmas movie? Is it
[01:28.820 --> 01:33.160]  not a Christmas movie? I know it's got action in it, but it's not Christmas. I don't care about
[01:33.160 --> 01:38.340]  any of that. I'm sick of that discourse. So we are just going to rank action movies in December. 31
[01:38.340 --> 01:44.540]  of them. We're going to determine what we think are the best action movies ever made. We are each
[01:44.540 --> 01:51.080]  going to submit six films in a rotation. And then we are going to, why don't we just, we'll use
[01:51.080 --> 01:58.720]  Ant Egg. But that makes 30, six times five. So I reached out to the action movie savant, TPG,
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.560]  got his opinion on what the number one should be. So we'll add that to the list and then it'll
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.640]  be 30 other ones. I don't think we'll have any disagreement with his contribution to the list.
[02:08.860 --> 02:14.100]  And then once we have all 31 built out, we will then, I guess, debate or talk amongst each other
[02:14.100 --> 02:21.660]  and try to figure out where do these place on this list from 31st to first. Okay. So when I was
[02:21.660 --> 02:28.520]  originally getting my list together, I started picking stuff that I really liked, but I went like,
[02:28.620 --> 02:32.040]  oh yeah, these guys probably haven't seen these, but I really love these movies. So I quickly had
[02:32.040 --> 02:39.300]  to redo my list, my entire list out the window. Is it because you're so cool, Eric? No, it's because
[02:39.300 --> 02:45.160]  when I, I have a friend who shows me crazy Hong Kong action movies and stuff that came out in
[02:45.160 --> 02:54.000]  1989 that like should have died with VHS, but he has like weird like prints of, yeah, where it's
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.180]  like, this is called fist fighter. And I'm like, I don't think anybody's ever seen it. It is just
[03:00.780 --> 03:06.540]  blockbuster garbage movies that I love. Why don't you pick those? Those are your favorite. Because
[03:07.140 --> 03:14.560]  I don't want to be 31 through 27. You will be dude. I'm going to be 31 through 27. You know that
[03:14.560 --> 03:19.480]  I don't want to do that. I just, I'm picking you get to be 26. You get to be 26 through 20.
[03:19.880 --> 03:26.720]  Listen, it could be, it might be 26 on the list because it is a collective representation of us,
[03:26.740 --> 03:30.640]  but that it's number one in your heart. And people will know that I'm not looking for number one in
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.520]  my heart. I'm here to win. There's no winning. There's not any winning or losing. No, no,
[03:35.520 --> 03:39.780]  I'm going to win. What if we put a heart by our favorite one? Yeah. I mean, if I have the highest
[03:39.780 --> 03:46.240]  numbers, then I win. There's the, okay. US mindset over here, right, Gavin? I know, I know one person
[03:46.240 --> 03:52.460]  you're going to beat right off the jump. Is it Gavin? Let's get to it. Okay, so let's start.
[03:52.780 --> 03:56.760]  We can go in an egg order because we're just going to make the bank before we go over to
[03:56.760 --> 04:01.320]  a ranking board. But what, we should probably put TPG's movie first. I was going to say,
[04:01.320 --> 04:07.540]  TPG, no surprise. Bad Boys 2. Course it is. Number one. Hell yeah. All expected it. Should
[04:07.540 --> 04:13.480]  be on this list, I think. Have no problem with it. Which leads to me. My first contribution to
[04:13.480 --> 04:18.440]  this list is going to be Predator, one of my favorite action movies of all time. One of my
[04:18.440 --> 04:23.660]  favorite movies of all time. Pete Arnold, fighting stuff in the jungle. Cool group of commandos.
[04:24.100 --> 04:28.160]  It's awesome. I love it. I have a question. Yeah. Now that none of us can pick Predator,
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.600]  how is this not draft? Because we're not drafting. We're just compiling a list and
[04:32.600 --> 04:38.800]  then as a group, we are ranking them. Okay. There's zero draft. It's more like the 98 movies
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.760]  thing. Yeah. But we're just making the list instead of Andrew presenting it to us. Exactly.
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.580]  There's zero drafting occurring. And there's no winning, I've been told. And there's no winning.
[04:49.400 --> 04:52.920]  I'm going to, but you can't. Okay. We'll find out. We'll see. But Nick,
[04:52.920 --> 04:58.840]  what is your contribution to this list? I think it's a fairly recent one, but I'm going to go
[04:58.840 --> 05:05.500]  with Taken, a great movie. Oh, damn it. Damn you. See, I just, I like the idea of Liam Neeson being
[05:05.500 --> 05:09.060]  an action guy. Cause that's the movie that kind of turned him into that. And ever, ever since then,
[05:09.080 --> 05:13.940]  that's all he does. But before that, you know, he was just kind of a, what, rom-com show up and
[05:13.940 --> 05:19.280]  stuff guy. And, uh, and I just love that movie. It's got some of the best, the best delivered
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.520]  dialogue about finding and killing someone and then actually doing it later. Yeah. Great movie.
[05:24.820 --> 05:27.740]  If you watch it and then the sequels, it makes the first one seem even better.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.820]  Oh yeah. Big time. I went through recently. I'm really excited for him to be in Naked Gun.
[05:35.180 --> 05:39.840]  Yeah, me too. That's going to be awesome. He's so dry. It's going to be really, really funny.
[05:40.060 --> 05:48.840]  Speaking of dry, Eric, what is your first pick? Uh, my dry, dry pick is so dry because of how
[05:48.840 --> 05:54.720]  hot it is. And that movie is Heat. Goddamn this.
[05:57.400 --> 06:02.240]  I'm losing movies left and right. It's a great movie. It's iconic sequence. It's almost a draft.
[06:03.180 --> 06:09.460]  Hey, hey, Jeff, you teed me up. I'm going to tee you up. What's your movie pick? When I think about
[06:09.460 --> 06:15.560]  a classic action movie, there are two things that are must-haves. I'm not going to tell you the
[06:15.560 --> 06:20.120]  first yet. I'm going to let you figure it out based on my picks. But I will tell you what the
[06:20.120 --> 06:27.220]  second one is. And it's a good villain. And there's nobody schemier and grimier than Detroit
[06:27.780 --> 06:35.200]  industrialist Peter Delaplane, played by Craig T. Nelson in the 1988 Carl Weathers-helmed action
[06:35.200 --> 06:41.760]  flick Action Jackson. Nice. That's pretty cool. That's cool. Yep. That was not on my list. It
[06:41.760 --> 06:47.500]  I discovered it recently when looking at Carl Weathers' IMDb after watching Rocky. Great poster.
[06:47.880 --> 06:51.900]  Great movie. Saw it at the theater. Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome. Did you really? Damn. That's
[06:51.900 --> 06:57.940]  cool. That rules. Gavin, if you have any movies left, it's time for your pick. A lovely film
[06:57.940 --> 07:03.700]  about a man who spends a day stuck in things that refuse to stop. It's Speed. Yeah, Speed was on my
[07:03.700 --> 07:09.140]  list too. Great. Speed was definitely on my list. I'm surprised they haven't remade Speed.
[07:09.720 --> 07:12.860]  It feels like a thing they should have done by now. Speed 2 Cruise Control?
[07:13.220 --> 07:15.700]  Well, that's not a remake. That's certainly not a remake.
[07:18.020 --> 07:23.400]  Speed 2, unless they did like Evil Dead 2 with Speed, which is I like. Yeah, premise.
[07:24.200 --> 07:28.340]  Are we doing Snake Draft or are we just going back around to the start? Let's do Snake.
[07:28.680 --> 07:32.980]  OK, there you go. Whatever works. So Gavin gets two. Gavin, what's your other one?
[07:35.740 --> 07:40.140]  Otherwise, Gavin just gets fucked over and over again. Apparently not prepared for this. I will
[07:40.140 --> 07:45.960]  take it. I wouldn't say it's all action, but there's certainly some very satisfying visual
[07:45.960 --> 07:53.380]  action in Inception. Inception almost made my list. I think it's really. Yeah, I think that's
[07:53.380 --> 07:56.660]  a really good one. I like Inception a lot. My brain immediately went, well, that's near the
[07:56.660 --> 08:00.820]  bottom. This is not what I think of when I think of action, but it's a great movie.
[08:02.060 --> 08:04.740]  We're not even ranking it yet, and Andrew's trying to put you at the bottom.
[08:05.020 --> 08:10.100]  That's how it read to me. Dude, he wants you to lose this thing. The hallway is really cool.
[08:10.200 --> 08:15.720]  Ah, maybe I'm changing, but that hallway sequence is really cool. I just haven't seen it in a while.
[08:16.600 --> 08:26.120]  Jeff, you have another pick. You started with action, Jackson. Jackson, what's next? If you
[08:26.120 --> 08:32.700]  know one thing about old Jeff, it's that Jeff is an American. I'm so American that I'm a United
[08:32.700 --> 08:39.280]  States Army veteran. You can't see it right now, but I'm saluting an invisible flag because of my
[08:39.280 --> 08:46.440]  pride. And because of my pride, I care about one thing, POWs. I want to bring those boys home. A
[08:46.440 --> 08:51.700]  lot of people think I'm talking about Rambo right now, because Rambo went, John went out. He went
[08:51.700 --> 08:56.920]  back over there and he saved those American men and he brought them back home. But he wasn't the
[08:56.920 --> 09:01.900]  first to do it. The first to do it was actually Colonel James Braddock, aka Chuck Norris,
[09:02.120 --> 09:10.320]  in Missing in Action. Whoa! Hey! That's fun. Jeff's picks are fun. I like this.
[09:11.320 --> 09:17.100]  This is cool. This is great. This is my wheelhouse right here. This is fun stuff.
[09:17.100 --> 09:23.620]  I'm going to keep it easy before I start getting into my deeper what who,
[09:23.660 --> 09:27.060]  but where do I want to put this? Do I want to get, I want to get this on the board
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.080]  now and I'm going to go Terminator 2. Ooh, great pick. Terminator.
[09:35.860 --> 09:42.100]  Terminator 2 is, it definitely belongs on this list and I'm going to win,
[09:42.100 --> 09:49.620]  so I feel good about this pick. Nick! My friends, there's a movie that has no
[09:49.620 --> 09:54.700]  business having a sequel to it, but at the time it was excellent and it's great. And again,
[09:54.740 --> 09:59.240]  I don't know why there's a sequel coming out for it, but it's Russell Crowe's Lead Gladiator.
[09:59.780 --> 10:04.000]  Good action. Great movie. A lot of cool action sequences, even the beginning with the,
[10:04.140 --> 10:09.500]  when he's still the Roman general. But a lot of cool stuff that they did then in the Coliseum.
[10:09.500 --> 10:12.060]  Are you going to see the new one? When it comes to streaming.
[10:14.120 --> 10:20.940]  So no rush. No, no hurry in getting the Gladiator 2. Okay. Good to know. Okay,
[10:21.020 --> 10:27.000]  Andrew, you get two. I get two. Back to back, which is very exciting. I'm going to go with
[10:27.700 --> 10:33.440]  one that is close to my heart. Not, I think, viewed as an iconic action movie, but I think it
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.740]  gets slept on. I think it's so much fun. My pick is The Rundown, starring The Rock. I think it's
[10:38.740 --> 10:45.520]  best work. You have Christopher Walken as a really fun villain. The only WWE produced film
[10:45.520 --> 10:51.920]  that I would ever recommend anyone see. Huh. Interesting. Really like The Rundown. And I'm
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.780]  going to follow that up. Good movie. With, uh, what am I going to follow it up with? I'm going
[10:56.780 --> 11:02.340]  to follow it up with a movie that probably is incredibly offensive to watch now, but it is
[11:02.340 --> 11:07.460]  an insanely fun action flick that I don't remember a lot of outside of constantly saying,
[11:07.460 --> 11:13.000]  this is fucking crazy. My pick is Crank 2, starring Jason Statham. Oh, wow.
[11:14.260 --> 11:19.280]  That movie's fucking nuts in a really fun way. Which is the crank where the nipples get cut off?
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.620]  Is that crank 2 or 1? That might be 2. I don't remember. I don't remember. It says a lot.
[11:25.220 --> 11:30.740]  Yeah. I remember there's a scene where they like remake the old Godzilla things,
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.560]  but with Jason Statham and he's like a paper, like a statue. God, that is the weirdest. It's
[11:35.560 --> 11:44.180]  fucking crazy movie. Yeah. Yeah. Good pick. Crank 2. That's fun. Nick, Crank 2 was the
[11:44.180 --> 11:49.440]  previous pick. What do you have that goes on this list? Well, this is the movie that taught
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.220]  us that Colin Firth could actually be an action star. And that is King's in the Secret Service.
[11:54.660 --> 11:57.660]  He started killing zombies. It was great.
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.760]  King's in the Secret Service with Taron Egerton. Egerton? I have no idea. Another great start with
[12:06.760 --> 12:13.400]  some dog shit sequels. Yeah. Yeah. I was so excited for the sequels because I liked the
[12:13.400 --> 12:18.240]  first one so much. It's such a good first movie. Yeah. And then it was just like, yeah, what if we
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.700]  fucked off? And it's like, oh shit, I hadn't considered that. Yeah. What if we just fucked
[12:23.700 --> 12:28.780]  off? And then like, that didn't go well. Let's just do a prequel. Everybody loves prequels.
[12:29.080 --> 12:34.980]  Like, what the fuck? I didn't see that one. Super weird. Yeah, it was okay. Yeah. I hadn't seen it.
[12:35.060 --> 12:39.300]  It looked weird, though. Yeah. I have the next pick that goes on this, and it is something we
[12:39.300 --> 12:44.160]  have not picked yet. Andrew mentioned it in his opening. And for me, it will be Die Hard.
[12:47.040 --> 12:53.300]  Great pick. Strong pick. Gonna win. Love it. Blood feat. Yeah. Well, I was talking about it
[12:53.300 --> 12:55.740]  yesterday. I was in the grass and I was making fists with my toes.
[13:00.180 --> 13:05.500]  Should we see who has the strongest toe fist? I don't. Do you guys get a lot of foot cramps?
[13:06.180 --> 13:13.920]  No. I get a lot of foot cramps. It hurts all the time. It's the worst. I have to put pressure on
[13:13.920 --> 13:17.460]  it instantly. Yeah, me too. I take like a lot of potassium to make sure it doesn't happen more.
[13:18.120 --> 13:26.040]  Yeah. Oh, man. Hate foot cramps. All right. Minions not making the list, but Jeff has the
[13:26.040 --> 13:33.600]  next pick. Jeff, what do you got? I'm gonna pick a movie that's typically considered the 12th best
[13:33.600 --> 13:41.380]  film of this person's career. It was ahead of its time. When you want an action movie,
[13:41.420 --> 13:45.920]  you want a movie that knows what it is and it isn't afraid to poke a little bit of fun at itself.
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.440]  You also want not only an adventure, but something that you can plug yourself. You can see yourself
[13:50.440 --> 13:55.740]  in the titular role, right? Which is why I wanted to be little Danny Madigan when I was transported
[13:55.740 --> 14:01.340]  to my favorite action film world, where Jack Slater, Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes my friend
[14:01.340 --> 14:09.160]  and helps me battle villains. I'm talking about Last Action Hero, 1993. The 12th best Arnold
[14:09.160 --> 14:15.560]  Schwarzenegger film ever made. When I was a kid, we had HBO for like three months
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.120]  and it was when Last Action Hero came to HBO. So I don't remember anything about this movie,
[14:21.220 --> 14:25.740]  but I've seen it probably a dozen times. I love this movie. Yeah, I haven't seen it.
[14:26.080 --> 14:29.620]  I just remember it looking gross. And then like, isn't like Sylvester Stallone,
[14:29.700 --> 14:32.340]  the Terminator or something like that? That's like the funny joke.
[14:32.580 --> 14:34.780]  I have seen a GTA 4 adaption of it though.
[14:37.440 --> 14:38.320]  From 2012.
[14:40.280 --> 14:44.080]  Gavin, you get two picks. Back to back. Remember, not a draft.
[14:44.080 --> 14:48.360]  I would say it's a, it's considered a classic movie where the sequel, in my opinion,
[14:48.500 --> 14:54.040]  is much better and the original is actually complete dog shit. I'm going with Top Gun Maverick.
[14:54.940 --> 14:57.920]  Wow. Okay. I also don't like the first movie.
[14:58.740 --> 15:03.020]  I was like the only kid in America who didn't like it when it came out.
[15:03.280 --> 15:07.780]  I get it. I don't, I don't fault you for not, especially for like when it came out,
[15:07.820 --> 15:11.240]  I probably wouldn't have liked it either. I think there's just like a lot of nostalgia and like
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.100]  it became a cultural touchstone. I don't think it's as good as the second one. The second one's
[15:16.100 --> 15:21.860]  crazy. Second one's awesome. And the practical action, love it. It's so cool to see a movie
[15:21.860 --> 15:25.880]  that decides there are bad guys, but won't tell you anything about them, who they are,
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.980]  or show them in any way, shape, or form other than guys in full body suits with gloves and masks.
[15:31.220 --> 15:36.360]  It's the best that you don't, there's no nation attached. It is for the world. It's really great.
[15:37.500 --> 15:38.940]  Gavin, you get one more choice here.
[15:38.940 --> 15:45.220]  What film has such moments as people's hands getting blown off, or melting,
[15:45.740 --> 15:50.500]  or big metal bastards struggling to get in and out of a car? It's Robocop.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.280]  Robocop was on my list. It's a good one. It's a great movie. Yeah. It's a lot of fun action.
[15:59.580 --> 16:07.200]  It's so bad, but good. Yes. It's fun in like a sarcastic way, almost.
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.880]  It's like a satire on a lot of that stuff, but not, but it definitely is. And it's a blast.
[16:13.120 --> 16:22.020]  What a fun movie. Robocop needs his Oreos. That's the greatest story, that's so funny.
[16:22.300 --> 16:26.060]  And then it hard cuts to him, I don't want to eat a fucking Oreos.
[16:29.700 --> 16:35.780]  That's great. Jeff, what do you got? When I think of action, I think of three names.
[16:35.780 --> 16:43.680]  Uh-huh. I think of John Travolta. I think of Robert Duvall. And I think of maybe the greatest
[16:43.680 --> 16:50.960]  action star of all time, underrated, sure, but I think we can all agree, Tony Shalhoub. And when
[16:50.960 --> 16:56.180]  I think of action, yeah, I think about guns and bullets and explosions, but sometimes action can
[16:56.180 --> 17:02.240]  be words. That's why I'm picking the legal thriller based on a true story, a civil action. I thought
[17:02.240 --> 17:06.180]  you were going to tell me that there was a Monk movie. Deception moved to 30. There is a Monk
[17:06.180 --> 17:10.340]  movie. It's on Peacock, but I haven't seen it. Oh, shit. Oh, we got to watch Monk, baby. It's
[17:10.340 --> 17:16.840]  like Mr. Monk Rides Again or something. Mr. Monk's Last Case. Maybe that's what it is. Mr. Monk's
[17:16.840 --> 17:22.800]  Last Case. Mr. Monk Rides Again? Is that like Mr. Bean-ass Idol? Yeah, that's such like a pig
[17:22.800 --> 17:38.570]  to be. It's Mr. Monk's Last Case. Very funny. I'm going to do my next pick, and this is going to be
[17:38.570 --> 17:47.090]  a shout out to TPG himself, who graced us with Bad Boys 2. I am picking the Michael Bay film
[17:47.090 --> 17:56.690]  Fuck. Ambulance. Spelled correctly with the L.A. capitalized because L.A. is a character in the
[17:56.690 --> 18:06.310]  film. It's not a good character, but it doesn't make any sense. But yeah, it's great. Ambulance,
[18:06.490 --> 18:12.690]  my pick. But next is Nick. There were several years there where you couldn't think of an action
[18:12.690 --> 18:19.310]  movie without one Harrison Ford. And there's a movie that I remember from when I was little
[18:19.310 --> 18:24.810]  that taught me a lot about one, being an action star, and two, being the president of the United
[18:24.810 --> 18:30.650]  States. And that is Air Force One, where Harrison Ford's plane is taken over and he has to take it
[18:30.650 --> 18:36.750]  back. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Good, memorable, phenomenal list. Yeah, yeah, this is great.
[18:37.350 --> 18:44.310]  We got Andrew. Back to back. You guys have me stressed out because there are certain movies
[18:44.310 --> 18:49.430]  where I feel like these can't not be on the list, but there's more than two. And I'm trying to
[18:49.430 --> 18:54.490]  decide which two I want to go with. I'm going to start with. It just has to be on the list.
[18:55.090 --> 19:02.270]  Arnold Schwarzenegger. Absolute classic. Commando. We can't have a 31 best action movie list without
[19:02.270 --> 19:06.850]  Commando. I think his most over-the-top, ridiculous action movie. Yeah, definitely,
[19:07.070 --> 19:13.450]  definitely is. Great villain too. Great villain. Who's the villain? The guy with the mustache and
[19:13.450 --> 19:19.510]  the mesh shirt, who actually, I think the villain, I think that dude is the dude who wore the mask
[19:19.510 --> 19:24.010]  in Road Warrior. Oh, I think you're right. Look that up and double check, but I think it's the
[19:24.010 --> 19:30.750]  same dude. He should have kept the mask on. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah, his shirt looks like
[19:30.750 --> 19:35.170]  it's chain mail throughout most of the film, which is just like also a strange choice. It also
[19:35.170 --> 19:39.250]  has great little underbosses kind of throughout that he makes his way through, like a Sega
[19:39.250 --> 19:43.570]  Genesis game. Like the dude who's like, I eat green berets for breakfast. Are you kidding me?
[19:43.610 --> 19:47.890]  Where that guy, he says, you promised you'd kill me last. And then he said, I lied. And then he
[19:47.890 --> 19:56.210]  lets him go. That rocks. And then for my second pick, I am going to take none other than The
[19:56.210 --> 20:00.210]  Raid 2. And I'm just going to hope some of these other films get picked. The Raid 2 is fucking
[20:00.210 --> 20:06.050]  phenomenal. So good. I didn't put The Raid 2 on my list because I thought TPG was going to pick it.
[20:06.090 --> 20:09.950]  It was on his top five. But if he had more than one pick, I think it would have been.
[20:10.350 --> 20:16.270]  Yeah, it definitely would have been. We only have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[20:16.350 --> 20:22.950]  Oh my God, we're so close. So close to the end, guys. Nick, what do you got? There was a time
[20:23.570 --> 20:30.110]  when action movies were synonymous with one Sean Connery. And he came back to do one of
[20:30.110 --> 20:36.970]  my favorite films. You son of a bitch. And a Michael Bay film. You son of a bitch, Nick. It's
[20:36.970 --> 20:44.810]  The Rock. It is The Rock. Excellent action movie. Yep. Love it. Gavin and I are in such different
[20:44.810 --> 20:48.510]  boats where he's annoyed that you're taking it. And I'm just sitting here anxiously going,
[20:48.690 --> 20:53.530]  somebody please pick some of these. Someone, please. You should be on the list. It's a draft.
[20:53.830 --> 20:59.070]  It's not a draft. Nobody's drafting. It's not a draft. I'm going to win, but it's not a draft.
[20:59.070 --> 21:07.650]  And I already won. My next pick might not be a favorite in this group, but if you ask your dad,
[21:07.890 --> 21:14.050]  it's probably his favorite. And that's going to be Warriors. That is a classic. That's a dad
[21:14.050 --> 21:18.930]  action movie all the way. If you put that on, dad will walk by and go, what's that? Oh, Warriors. I
[21:18.930 --> 21:23.170]  remember when this came out and you sit down and watch the whole thing. The most badass swan in
[21:23.170 --> 21:28.070]  all film. Hell yeah. Also, the guy in Commando who gets held upside down and says, you kill me last.
[21:28.070 --> 21:35.670]  That's the bad guy in Warriors. Awesome. Fantastic. Fantastic. Jeff, what do you got?
[21:36.210 --> 21:44.290]  When I think of action, I think of a few things. I think of bears. I think of ukuleles. I think of
[21:44.290 --> 21:51.750]  stunts and explosions. I think of theme parks. I think of the year 2018 when Johnny Knoxville
[21:51.750 --> 21:59.550]  released Action Point, the instant classic. That's my pick. Action Point, the one about the
[21:59.550 --> 22:05.750]  amusement park? Yes. Which do you prefer, Point or Jackson? I'd probably pick Jackson. That's why I
[22:05.750 --> 22:09.730]  selected it first. Yeah, I think Action Jackson would probably be my pick above these. Yeah,
[22:10.010 --> 22:16.570]  definitely. But hey, but guess what, Gavin? You get two picks here. Why don't you end this round
[22:16.570 --> 22:23.110]  and then begin our final round in the Action Movie Ranker? Well, I did have a Michael Bay,
[22:23.190 --> 22:28.650]  but it's gone because it was drafted away from me. So I'm going to go with a lovely bit of
[22:28.650 --> 22:34.130]  Jimmy Bond with probably the best action in the entire franchise, and that's in Casino Royale.
[22:34.510 --> 22:40.450]  Yeah, that's a good one, baby. That's great. And he walks out of the water like a sensual ape.
[22:40.450 --> 22:46.710]  He's got his shoulders moving. Yeah, that's pretty cool. That's a good one. Next one. Yeah,
[22:46.750 --> 22:51.330]  see, I'm digging deep down my list now, and I'm going to go. This might be considered quite a
[22:51.330 --> 22:55.930]  strange pick. It's quite recent, but I did like a lot of the action in it, and that is the movie
[22:55.930 --> 23:03.350]  that couldn't decide what it was called, The Edge of Tomorrow. Oh, that's a great one. That is fun.
[23:03.510 --> 23:09.650]  Yeah. Yep. Are they making a sequel to that or no? Kind of, maybe. They've been saying they will
[23:09.650 --> 23:14.790]  for like over a decade. So that's what I thought, too, is that like they just keep talking about it.
[23:14.890 --> 23:19.910]  And like, I don't know. Are they like teasing us or what? I don't know. I hope they do. Yep. All
[23:19.910 --> 23:26.150]  right. Jeff, your final action pick. Oh, is this my sixth pick? It's your final pick. Yeah. Oh,
[23:26.190 --> 23:31.010]  OK. Man, where did the time go? Right. I'm going to have to whittle through and figure out what's
[23:31.010 --> 23:38.210]  my favorite. OK. Yeah. All right. When I think of action, I think of three names that are different
[23:38.210 --> 23:43.510]  from the previous three names I said. Maybe the three names that you thought were omitted. You
[23:43.510 --> 23:47.910]  might have thought to yourself, well, yeah, it's Shalhoub, of course. And then he's got Duvall.
[23:48.410 --> 23:52.450]  He's got the guns. Everybody knows about Duvall. And, you know, he rips his chest shirt off and
[23:52.450 --> 23:57.790]  he gets all fucking yoked. And then and then Travolta. But he missed Brendan Fraser, Jenna
[23:57.790 --> 24:02.150]  Elfman and Steve Martin, three of the greatest action stars in the history of our fine country.
[24:02.270 --> 24:06.710]  I'm, of course, speaking of. And by the way, there's been a disturbing lack of animation on
[24:06.710 --> 24:13.210]  this list. That's why I'm picking Looney Tunes back in action. I had no idea there was so many
[24:13.850 --> 24:20.190]  movies with action in the name. That that movie bombed so hard, it killed a Space Jam sequel with
[24:20.190 --> 24:26.470]  Tony Hawk. That's true. I saw that. I saw that TikTok. Yep. I saw it in theaters and really
[24:26.470 --> 24:33.630]  liked it as a child. Bummer. My final pick, I picked I picked all my top of the pop ones for
[24:33.630 --> 24:41.230]  my my my my final pick was going to be my number one pick when I was making my initial list. And it
[24:41.230 --> 24:52.570]  is from 1985. It is Michelle Yao and Cynthia Rothrock. Yes, Madam, a.k.a. Super Cops. It is a
[24:53.230 --> 25:01.250]  fucking incredible action movie with a final fight action sequence that is out of control. I love
[25:01.250 --> 25:05.830]  Yes, Madam. It is a fantastic film that I recommend to everyone. But see, this is why I didn't pick
[25:05.830 --> 25:12.110]  all six like this. So there you go. Now, Nick, what is your final pick? Well, here's the thing.
[25:13.030 --> 25:18.610]  Sometimes an action movie needs a little bit of levity, a little bit of comedy, a little bit of
[25:18.610 --> 25:26.910]  commentary. And I would like to pick in this instance, Hot Fuzz. Oh, because one, it's hilarious
[25:26.910 --> 25:32.090]  action, but also at the end, it is one of the most action packed sequences to finish a movie.
[25:32.730 --> 25:38.630]  And I just love Timothy Dalton in that. So, so good. It gets a bit of Muddle Village. We know
[25:38.630 --> 25:42.910]  somebody who worked on that film, Nick. Really? Yeah. I'll tell you about it someday. Oh,
[25:44.770 --> 25:48.110]  if you're good, I'll tell you about it. Thanks, man. I'll wait.
[25:49.350 --> 25:54.150]  And then finally, to finish our movie bank so we can get on to the rankings,
[25:54.150 --> 26:00.210]  Andrew, you have the final pick. So many classic, great action movies still to pick from.
[26:00.610 --> 26:04.970]  It's once again, it's the thing where I just can't imagine this not having a point in our list.
[26:05.190 --> 26:11.150]  So my pick is going to be none other than John Wick. The first John Wick. That was slightly
[26:11.150 --> 26:17.890]  further down my list. Probably like the most past decade of action has been led by that.
[26:18.190 --> 26:22.830]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[26:22.830 --> 26:27.950]  blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar
[26:27.950 --> 26:32.770]  cold foam. Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[26:33.850 --> 26:39.090]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is
[26:39.090 --> 26:44.110]  a great feeling. And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you
[26:44.110 --> 26:48.510]  choose an option that's right for you. Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone,
[26:48.510 --> 26:52.270]  or using the award-winning app, it's nice knowing you have help finding
[26:52.270 --> 26:56.250]  coverage that best fits your needs. Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[26:58.850 --> 27:04.050]  Well, there you go. I think that's a very strong list of 31 that we will be ranking here.
[27:04.990 --> 27:09.190]  Top to bottom, do you guys have any honorable mentions that you want to just throw out before
[27:09.190 --> 27:13.090]  we get to the ranking? I couldn't figure out so many. I wanted to get one of the Bourne movies
[27:13.090 --> 27:16.370]  on there, but I couldn't pick one. I would probably pick the third one, but I don't know.
[27:16.370 --> 27:19.690]  It's just a good franchise. There's no Mission Impossibles on here.
[27:20.150 --> 27:23.730]  Yep. I was really hoping Jeff would go with Mission Impossible 3. I know how much he loves it.
[27:24.110 --> 27:28.770]  Oh, it's one of my favorite all-time movies. Yeah, it was called such a great film.
[27:28.950 --> 27:29.890]  Action Impossible.
[27:32.670 --> 27:39.290]  Unfortunately, it didn't fit the criteria as I understood it, but I would have been honored to
[27:39.290 --> 27:43.470]  pick it. I was going to the other ones that were sort of like at the top that I wanted to
[27:44.210 --> 27:50.610]  put on here were Fast 9. They go to space, and I think that's hard to top as far as action goes,
[27:50.870 --> 27:54.330]  especially when you see it in 4DX. You could shake it around, and they fill the whole
[27:54.730 --> 28:01.450]  theater with smoke, and it's crazy. It's very, very cool. Snake Eyes was another one I was going
[28:01.450 --> 28:05.450]  to put on here. Classic. But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But we got to watch it, you know what I
[28:05.450 --> 28:09.490]  mean? That's true. You guys need to experience it so that way you can really understand what's
[28:09.490 --> 28:15.250]  impressive about it. I was on the fence about this one, and I was wondering if this was maybe
[28:15.250 --> 28:20.290]  on any of your backup lists as well. The 1943 Humphrey Bogart classic action in the North
[28:20.290 --> 28:25.130]  Atlantic. Were any of you guys considering that? You know, it crossed my mind, but I didn't.
[28:25.410 --> 28:27.610]  I think Gavin was going to, and that's why I didn't put it on mine.
[28:27.990 --> 28:37.870]  Yes, okay. How about the Burt Lancaster films with Robert Ryan and Will Greer? Executive
[28:37.870 --> 28:44.750]  action by JFK? No, that wasn't on mine either. Oh, I missed that one. I almost went for Rush Hour,
[28:45.190 --> 28:50.510]  but yeah, that's a good one. Those are really fun. I thought about Blade. Yeah, I was on my list.
[28:51.550 --> 28:58.330]  I had Ong Bak on my list, which was really difficult for me to not include, but great
[28:58.330 --> 29:04.150]  action movie as well as The Equalizer 3, which does something very specific for action.
[29:05.730 --> 29:10.470]  Equilibrium, that's a good one. Oh, I had that on my list, yeah. Classic. A lot of good action
[29:10.470 --> 29:15.510]  movies out there. So many. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was going to go with Lady Terminator and Parole
[29:15.510 --> 29:21.510]  Violators. Ooh, Parole Violators has a really great line near the end where a guy says,
[29:21.690 --> 29:26.970]  you're under arrest for violating parole, and then shoots a guy at point blank range in the throat.
[29:29.190 --> 29:35.110]  It is so funny. It's so funny. But that's what my list was going to be comprised of that stuff.
[29:35.210 --> 29:39.430]  But now we got to rank, guys. I don't know if we start top to bottom, we start throwing stuff
[29:39.430 --> 29:45.170]  in places. How do you want to go about this? Well, let's just, in my experience of doing this
[29:45.170 --> 29:49.550]  type of thing, it's easy to like make tiers and then make groups and then fight within the
[29:49.550 --> 29:55.510]  placement of those tiers. OK, I mean, I can put them off to the side as like a temp hold place.
[29:55.510 --> 30:00.030]  I think Bad Boys 2 is going to be in the top 10. And I think that's something we all would
[30:00.030 --> 30:05.050]  probably agree on. I think Bad Boys 2 would go in the top 10. Sure. We all feel Bad Boys 2 in
[30:05.050 --> 30:11.390]  the top 10? Yes. Sure. OK, I think I'm just listing it here like I can put it in the actual list.
[30:12.710 --> 30:15.670]  Yeah, why don't you just put it at five to start and then we can. You got it. OK,
[30:15.910 --> 30:23.970]  sure. OK, Bad Boys 2 is on the list. Hang on, how do I do what's like the cool little button to do
[30:23.970 --> 30:29.290]  strike through? Well, he does that. Is there any other anything jump out to people of like
[30:29.290 --> 30:36.890]  think it'll be in the top 10? Yep. I think. I think Terminator 2 is in the top. Yeah,
[30:37.110 --> 30:43.910]  yeah, I would agree. Yeah, I'd agree. OK, I'm fine with that. OK, I didn't put Aliens on. Shit.
[30:44.970 --> 30:49.770]  Aliens is on my list. A lot of good stuff got missed. I think Die Hard is top 10.
[30:49.770 --> 30:54.550]  I would. Yeah, I would agree. I would ultimately agree. I did the thing where I made a note on my
[30:54.550 --> 30:59.550]  phone and it bolded the top thing I wrote, which was Aliens. And then I just ignored it because
[30:59.550 --> 31:08.910]  it looked like the title. Let's see what else is on this. Gladiator? Top 10? I would put it at the
[31:08.910 --> 31:12.810]  bottom half of the top 10 if it was going to be 10. If it's going into the top 10, I would put it at
[31:12.810 --> 31:17.530]  10. I think that's high. I'm not a huge Gladiator fan. I like it. I don't love it. I think Heat is
[31:17.530 --> 31:21.350]  in the top 10. Heat's a good movie in the top 10. Heat's good. Heat's a good movie. I'd put it at
[31:21.350 --> 31:26.310]  7. Where do you guys think Predator would go? Top 10. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, just making sure.
[31:26.550 --> 31:32.430]  OK. Do you guys all agree with that? Yeah, I certainly do. Yeah. Andrew wants to win.
[31:33.150 --> 31:37.130]  There's no winning. I just was worried that I like Predator way more than anyone else here. So
[31:37.130 --> 31:43.170]  seeing the enthusiasm around it, I like, dude, come on. It's fucking Predator. I could see
[31:44.570 --> 31:49.050]  Robocop going pretty high, or honestly, I could see The Rock going pretty high. Yeah, I haven't
[31:49.050 --> 31:54.010]  seen it, but like I know the love around it. I wouldn't argue that. I have no problem with it
[31:54.010 --> 31:57.910]  in the top 10. Do you think if it's a top 10, do you think it goes at like 9 or do you think it
[31:57.910 --> 32:03.450]  goes higher? That'll be for you guys. Jeff, what do you think? I'd say 9 is appropriate. Jeff made
[32:03.450 --> 32:07.350]  a grunt, so I want to know what he thought. What do you think, Gavin? For The Rock? Yeah. 9 or 10.
[32:07.550 --> 32:12.310]  OK. Yeah, I think so. I think just looking at the list that we have here and like where it stacks,
[32:12.310 --> 32:15.890]  like Casino Royale, I could easily put it at 8. I think I could probably put Casino Royale
[32:15.890 --> 32:19.510]  probably like a little bit higher. I love Casino Royale. Yeah, I could see that at 8,
[32:19.970 --> 32:26.310]  although it does have like 45 minutes of playing cards. It does, but I love that. Yeah, but it's
[32:26.310 --> 32:32.390]  so exciting. Yeah, it's very exciting. Anything else on here that jumps out to you guys that
[32:32.390 --> 32:36.110]  should be top 10? Top Gun Maverick, maybe? I don't think that's a top 10. I don't think
[32:36.110 --> 32:40.690]  that's a top 10. That movie's pretty fucking cool. It is pretty fucking cool. I mean, I would probably
[32:40.690 --> 32:46.610]  have RoboCop up there. I would put RoboCop in the top 10, probably like around like that 7 through
[32:46.610 --> 32:50.890]  10 slot, maybe or even like maybe like a little bit higher in like that midsection. Put it at
[32:50.890 --> 32:59.530]  1 or 2, sure. We'll start moving them around once we get into it. Yeah. Yeah. Just make sure you
[32:59.530 --> 33:05.550]  don't leave that there. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see what else could go in this top 10 that we feel
[33:05.550 --> 33:12.310]  that we would feel good about. Speed, I could see as a top 10 movie. I mean, I love that movie,
[33:12.370 --> 33:17.870]  but I don't see it as a top 10 action movie at all time. And that bus does jump that gap from
[33:17.870 --> 33:23.530]  nothing. Is it maybe do we pivot now and like put stuff at the bottom and just like start whittling
[33:23.530 --> 33:26.670]  that way? I feel like it's real. Yeah. What do you guys want to start putting at the bottom?
[33:27.790 --> 33:41.290]  Oh, let's see. I've never, I've never, you know, I've never seen Raid 2, so maybe put that at 31.
[33:41.890 --> 33:46.250]  No, I think Raid 2 is probably it's probably going to be like this. It's probably pretty high. It
[33:46.250 --> 33:50.550]  should probably be top five, but I'm not going to argue that because I don't think we'll put it at
[33:50.550 --> 33:55.570]  number one. No, I don't think it needs to be. No, I don't think it needs to be one. Put it at number
[33:55.570 --> 34:01.530]  five and put Bad Boys 2 at number one. How about how about we put Looney Tunes back in action at
[34:01.530 --> 34:07.250]  31? I'm someone who loves that movie. I would not think of it as like a great action movie.
[34:07.530 --> 34:12.670]  I mean, it's in the name. I got a problem with that. I mean, I'm fine with it. It's in the name.
[34:12.730 --> 34:18.870]  It's kind of super literal and more so than all but five other choices on this whole list.
[34:19.610 --> 34:25.450]  I would argue that there are six that stand out as probably the top six action films of all time.
[34:28.230 --> 34:30.090]  But I'd be willing to put Air Force One at 30.
[34:32.490 --> 34:39.350]  Is that right? Honestly, if I'm looking at movies that might go at 30, I'm thinking
[34:40.030 --> 34:45.550]  civil action. I, you know, I haven't seen it. Once again, I think it's odd that the name action is in
[34:45.550 --> 34:49.150]  it and it's somehow at the bottom of the action list. But if you want to put it at 30, go ahead.
[34:49.290 --> 34:53.210]  We got to start somewhere. Yeah, right. Yeah, great. I think a civil action could probably
[34:53.590 --> 34:57.930]  just hang out down here for a while. I mean, who knows? Maybe it bumps up. Maybe it goes to 29.
[34:58.370 --> 35:03.590]  Maybe we do the rundown at 29. I think the rundown could be like, yeah, I think the rundown could be
[35:03.590 --> 35:09.510]  like 23. It's yeah. Like, I'm fine with that. Like, that's no. Get out of here. Air Force One.
[35:09.550 --> 35:12.770]  Rundown is better than Air Force One. Way better than the Rundown. No, it's not. Jesus Christ.
[35:12.910 --> 35:18.270]  No, it's not. It's getting heated. Now, if it helps, I do think Air Force One either goes in at 24
[35:18.270 --> 35:24.530]  or 22. Air Force One is below the Rundown. They are. No, it's above. Those are those are not
[35:24.530 --> 35:29.030]  even Harrison Ford's best action. It's one of the better ones. What's his best action, Andrew?
[35:29.790 --> 35:34.270]  Six days, seven nights, clearly. All right. Well, I would have picked any I would have picked any
[35:34.270 --> 35:39.790]  number of Indiana Jones movies over that. But yeah, yeah, yeah. Or when he was Jack Ryan.
[35:40.010 --> 35:43.610]  Some of all fears. No, he's not Jack Ryan in that one. That's Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan.
[35:43.610 --> 35:49.770]  Any thoughts on like where do you think Taken lives? 14? Yeah, Taken is like in the 15, 20.
[35:50.430 --> 35:54.910]  I put Taken. That sounds good. Pretty close to John Wick. Oh, I think John Wick is number 15.
[35:55.010 --> 35:59.790]  I think John Wick is dead center. I think Taken has to be right above John Wick wherever they are
[35:59.790 --> 36:06.490]  on the list. Yeah, I think those are I think that's that's like a like one in one a type
[36:06.490 --> 36:12.070]  situation like where that's those are both. Yeah, they they shaded so much of what happens in action
[36:12.070 --> 36:17.390]  and it's like I didn't necessarily care for either one of those movies very much. I'm not going to
[36:17.390 --> 36:22.690]  argue because it's like doesn't really matter. The only movie on this list that I actively did not
[36:22.690 --> 36:28.050]  enjoy is Action Point. I really wanted to like it. I loved it. Put it at 29. You think you think
[36:28.050 --> 36:31.830]  Action Point probably at 29? OK, yeah, I think that's fair. What did you like about it? The
[36:31.830 --> 36:38.330]  weird mixed genre of it? It just it wasn't fun. You understand the name action is in the title,
[36:38.330 --> 36:44.610]  though. I do. Yeah. OK, I do absolutely have to acknowledge that does have action in the title.
[36:44.850 --> 36:52.350]  It's even the first word in the title, which some would argue would make it number one on this list
[36:53.750 --> 36:59.670]  is the only one. No, Action Jackson's here, too, man. That's true. One or two. That's a strong
[36:59.670 --> 37:04.430]  one and two. You made up a 28. Action Jackson's way better than number 28. Action Jackson is
[37:04.430 --> 37:08.190]  much better. Action Jackson and Miss Missing in Action are both better than number 28.
[37:08.530 --> 37:13.870]  I think like 21 and 22, maybe. Yeah, probably. That's that's totally fine. Action Jackson above
[37:13.870 --> 37:19.450]  Air Force One. Now, here's the thing. If I were to put them, I would put Action Jackson
[37:19.930 --> 37:25.690]  and Missing in Action both above the rundown and Air Force One. Yes, I agree. I agree without without
[37:25.690 --> 37:31.850]  any comment. I genuinely, honestly agree. Having seen both 100 percent. Yes. I think probably one
[37:31.850 --> 37:35.370]  of only two people in the room that's actually seen them. I would agree. Action Jackson,
[37:35.710 --> 37:43.070]  Missing in Action, fun ass, like exactly what you want out of them movies. The rundown was at came
[37:43.070 --> 37:50.250]  out at a time where everyone had the worst haircuts and movies look like shit. And it's hard to look
[37:50.250 --> 37:55.510]  at. I don't like looking at the rundown. I strongly disagree. They do this thing to Chuck Norris
[37:55.510 --> 38:01.250]  when he's trying to save the POWs. They string him up upside down, tie his hands behind him. So
[38:01.250 --> 38:05.790]  he's hanging upside down by his feet and they take a rag and they put or not a rag. I'm sorry,
[38:05.830 --> 38:10.170]  a bag like a burlap sack. And they put a rat in it like a giant angry rat. And they tie it around
[38:10.170 --> 38:14.730]  his head. And the rat's supposed to eat his brains out or whatever. And he like fucking rides around
[38:14.730 --> 38:19.110]  for a while. And then he said then he still and blood pours out and they're like, oh, the rat got
[38:19.110 --> 38:22.810]  him and they pull it out and he's just got the fucking dead rat in his mouth. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:23.050 --> 38:28.650]  It's so I'm going to I'm going to drop this photo in the chat real quick so you guys can see it.
[38:28.650 --> 38:36.410]  It's so fucking bloody. It rocks. Oh, yeah, there it is. It's so there's so much blood
[38:36.410 --> 38:45.470]  inside that rat. It goes everywhere. It's it's so oh my God, it's so awesome. It's so cool.
[38:45.630 --> 38:51.470]  So twenty twenty one, twenty two. I would put them right there. I think I think Action Jackson
[38:51.470 --> 38:57.890]  and Missing in Action are like right around the 20 spot. Sure. That's three. I'm going to put
[38:57.890 --> 39:02.490]  Missing in Action above Action Jackson. That's fine. Yeah, I think. Yeah, sure.
[39:02.930 --> 39:06.550]  Chuck Norris did spawn all those memes and whatnot. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's that's
[39:06.550 --> 39:15.210]  why I did that. Yeah. I think in let's talk about Inception. Oh, where does that go?
[39:15.450 --> 39:20.130]  That's really tough, because like as a movie, I'd put it a lot higher than I would as an action
[39:20.130 --> 39:26.930]  movie. Thinking like 16? It's not ahead of John Wick. I think it's like 12. Oh, I disagree. I don't
[39:26.930 --> 39:31.930]  think it's above Taken or John Wick. You don't think it's above Taken and John Wick, or you do?
[39:32.090 --> 39:36.570]  No, I think it's below. Yeah, I think 16, 17 is where it feels to me. OK, yeah, 17, I think it's
[39:36.570 --> 39:40.870]  on the strength of how good the movie is. But the on just from an action stand, it doesn't have
[39:40.870 --> 39:47.830]  action in the title, first of all. What about speed? I was just thinking speed is weird.
[39:48.350 --> 39:53.290]  It's definitely above Inception. Yeah. And it doesn't have action in the title. Here's a
[39:53.290 --> 40:02.090]  question. Is speed better than John Wick? Yes. Keanu versus Keanu. Speed is so much better than
[40:02.090 --> 40:08.250]  John Wick. It's like they're not like they're not close. Then it goes higher than 15. Yeah,
[40:08.290 --> 40:14.510]  it goes way higher than 15. Maybe put it at 13. It's definitely not top 10. It's tough. I think
[40:14.510 --> 40:19.510]  it I think it could be above John Wick. I think it's definitely above John Wick. You spend the
[40:19.510 --> 40:23.710]  whole movie with the bus and you expect it to eventually blow up and hit something. It hits a
[40:23.710 --> 40:29.830]  plane. Yeah. He's under the bus. They're jumping on and off the bus. They do a lot. They make a
[40:29.830 --> 40:35.210]  lot out of the bus. You got to give a deal for that. Absolutely. The bus stuff happens pretty
[40:35.210 --> 40:39.610]  quick. They're doing a lot of stuff not on the bus at the beginning of the movie, guys. There's a
[40:39.610 --> 40:44.890]  lot of action at the beginning of that film on the train. There's so much going on. John Wick,
[40:44.890 --> 40:51.790]  though, it's it's all about extreme pain visited on bad people that are bad to pets. That's true.
[40:52.770 --> 40:58.030]  See where it's complicated for me is I feel like speed is probably above Taken, but not above John
[40:58.030 --> 41:06.250]  Wick, which is the way I know. I don't think that you're nuts. I think John Wick. I think it's so
[41:06.250 --> 41:10.070]  much better than both of those movies. Honestly, I think Taken and John Wick are too high on this
[41:10.070 --> 41:14.730]  list, but I'm not going to fight for it. I think they're so cool. Both of them are so cool. I think
[41:14.730 --> 41:19.110]  Taken and John Wick are like 19 and 20. Taken, he shoots someone in the back. He shoots someone's
[41:19.110 --> 41:25.730]  wife. He shoots somebody's wife. Such a fucking tough moment, man. I think Taken's a better film.
[41:25.950 --> 41:30.530]  I do think speed is more fun than Taken. Like it might be easier to sit down. That I would agree
[41:30.530 --> 41:34.790]  with. Speed is a movie where if you just if you're walking through the room, your head just keeps
[41:34.790 --> 41:39.250]  looking and then you've been stood there for like eight minutes. Yeah. What I love so much about John
[41:39.250 --> 41:45.850]  Wick is it's about the existential dread of the people in universe understand that this is an
[41:45.850 --> 41:51.610]  action star, essentially, and that they have unleashed him upon themselves. I think that's so
[41:51.610 --> 41:56.950]  fun. Yeah. Like there's a level of awareness of like, oh, what you've did this. This isn't this
[41:56.950 --> 42:03.370]  is a cartoonish killer. This is a force of nature that we cannot stop. We're fine. And and it spawned
[42:03.370 --> 42:08.810]  a larger franchise than speed. Yeah. Yeah. Is that how we're judging these? No, like I don't. That
[42:08.810 --> 42:13.050]  doesn't add a lot to me personally. I just think that doesn't do shit. Honestly, I think that takes
[42:13.050 --> 42:16.990]  away. I don't think it takes away. I think that I don't think that takes away at all. But if it
[42:16.990 --> 42:21.990]  creates a whole universe, that's if it creates a whole universe that people want to play in for
[42:21.990 --> 42:25.770]  years to come. I don't see how that's a bad. The world building is really because everything that
[42:26.310 --> 42:30.270]  most of these movies and the things that spawn off of them are not worth. Like there's a reason
[42:30.270 --> 42:36.110]  that Terminator three isn't on this list. Terminator two and bad boys two are both in the top five
[42:36.110 --> 42:40.570]  right now. Those are both sequels. Right. They are. And they're and they're not higher. And Terminator
[42:40.570 --> 42:45.890]  one, I think, could be on this list. But I don't but I don't think that the sequel spawning thing
[42:45.890 --> 42:51.410]  is criteria for what is worth time. Let me try to thread this needle a little bit. I think, Jeff,
[42:51.430 --> 42:56.470]  you're so right that I think the world building in John Wick is super cool. And I think it's it's
[42:56.470 --> 43:01.010]  it shows how impactful that was. I also think that because they're sequels, it doesn't necessarily
[43:01.010 --> 43:04.850]  make it better. I'm not saying it makes it better. I'm just saying that you have to take into
[43:04.850 --> 43:08.770]  account that when they create such a rich world that people get to play in it for years to come.
[43:08.910 --> 43:14.510]  That's because the movie makes such a big impact. Yeah, that's fair. But I wouldn't the rock didn't
[43:14.510 --> 43:19.590]  make an impact in the way that that John Wick did clearly or there would have been a rock to.
[43:19.810 --> 43:25.630]  Well, it's like also like creative intent. There was no, I think, desire to make a rock to maybe
[43:25.630 --> 43:31.630]  where John Wick leads to like a definite sequels. One of the most direct sequels of doesn't John
[43:31.630 --> 43:36.590]  Wick to literally start where John Wick one ends. Like, I think it's beat for beat into the next.
[43:36.970 --> 43:39.690]  I don't know. I never saw John Wick. Yeah, I only saw the first one. You are right.
[43:45.980 --> 43:50.280]  John Wick 2 definitely better than Speed 2. It's the funniest thing you could have said right there.
[43:51.300 --> 43:52.920]  I don't fucking know. I didn't watch that shit.
[43:55.240 --> 44:02.080]  I just I just I failed to see why a movie spawning sequels is a bad thing to be on this list.
[44:02.080 --> 44:06.800]  Not a bad thing. I just like that's insane. That's an insanity to me. Oh, man. It's because
[44:06.800 --> 44:11.640]  it's like not just within the art, like there's financial motivations. And then you can, I guess,
[44:11.660 --> 44:14.880]  make an argument that it was financially successful because it connected with people.
[44:14.880 --> 44:18.140]  But it just gets money. I didn't see that one.
[44:21.680 --> 44:29.560]  Hot fuzz. Hot fuzz is weird because it's it's about it's about other action movies.
[44:30.400 --> 44:33.640]  Largely bad boys, too, isn't it? It's 45 minutes too long.
[44:34.020 --> 44:39.420]  I don't like this movie at all. Oh, well, you're crazy. What don't you like about it?
[44:39.880 --> 44:44.660]  Yeah, nothing was grabbing me. And the whole time I was going,
[44:44.980 --> 44:48.820]  well, I bet this was probably like a lot of fun to make. And that that didn't really
[44:48.820 --> 44:54.980]  they didn't really draw me in. It just it just wasn't. I think it was just a movie that wasn't
[44:54.980 --> 44:58.600]  for me. I think that's it. Yeah. How do you feel about whodunits generally?
[45:00.660 --> 45:06.700]  Uh, I don't. I'm fine with them. I just think like the action I thought was like medium action.
[45:06.700 --> 45:10.800]  And then they're like, now this is the part of the movie where we're going to do an action movie.
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.360]  And it all just felt very like like these like segments of ideas, like Baby Driver,
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.540]  where it was like I had this idea and it just sort of spawned the rest of the movie.
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.580]  That's how hot fuzz felt to me also is like I had this one idea and it just sort of spawns
[45:23.580 --> 45:27.300]  the rest of the movie around it. I like to just because it's so funny to have that combination
[45:27.300 --> 45:33.800]  of like Hollywood action with an English small town. Yeah. I like Timothy Dalton in it. He's also
[45:33.800 --> 45:37.300]  hilarious. I thought he I thought he was like a lot of fun. I didn't recognize him at first.
[45:37.380 --> 45:41.440]  I don't know why I didn't recognize him. And then the mustache. Yeah. And then it was like, oh,
[45:41.540 --> 45:47.000]  shit. I thought he was like a lot of fun. I think it's fun that when I think of hot fuzz, the main
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.880]  thing I think of is them watching action movies. Like that's the first thing that comes to mind.
[45:50.880 --> 45:56.260]  I'm watching Point Break, losing it. I think of a church steeple wedged up to the.
[45:59.820 --> 46:05.380]  Where does it go on the list? Twenty five. I would be fine with that. I'm totally fine with
[46:05.380 --> 46:10.320]  that. I'm totally the fact that you're OK with that, Nick. I'm very glad. Yeah. I mean, it's
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.840]  my last pick and it's a funny action movie. So I think that's probably where it goes. Um,
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.580]  I prefer Sean. Yeah. Sean of the Dead is better. Yeah. What was the other one?
[46:20.580 --> 46:26.540]  The last one nobody talks about. The World's End. Did you guys like that one? Not really.
[46:27.420 --> 46:32.280]  Very different. And also came out the same time as the end of the world, which made it really
[46:32.280 --> 46:38.520]  confusing. Oh, yeah, it did. Top Gun Maverick. Any thoughts on where that probably belongs?
[46:39.820 --> 46:44.980]  One of those. I should have seen it, but haven't. So 20. I will. Yeah, 20. I put a 20. I think it's
[46:44.980 --> 46:52.260]  a visual masterpiece and and such a generic plot, but just very cool to look at. I think it could
[46:52.260 --> 46:57.100]  go higher than 20, but I'm fine with putting it at 20. I could see it starting here and then we
[46:57.100 --> 47:02.460]  move it up to like 18. That would surprise me. That was going to say, yeah, I love the movie.
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.620]  I feel like the last action hero is not going to be ahead of Top Gun Maverick for best action movie.
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.940]  Yeah, that's tough. I like last action hero. But again, I've seen it like so many times and I don't
[47:12.940 --> 47:21.000]  remember anything. I remember a part with a grenade. Put it at 27. I think it's higher than
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.880]  27, though. I would. Yeah. 24? 24. I think it's better than the rundown, but we can put it at 24.
[47:27.500 --> 47:33.500]  Oh, switch the rundown with it. No. You like. We could put. You like the rock more than Arnold
[47:33.500 --> 47:39.400]  Schwarzenegger, huh? Well, no, it's just they're both like one. They're both great. I would just
[47:39.400 --> 47:44.740]  put other things. I would put I would move both of them up. What if we remove the rundown and put
[47:44.740 --> 47:51.260]  San Andreas on instead? That's not nearly as fun of a movie. What about Rampage? Big monkey. He
[47:51.260 --> 47:55.900]  fight big monkey. Oh, he does. Yeah. Thing I really like about last action hero is he's an
[47:55.900 --> 48:00.340]  action character that's put into the real world. Yeah. And they immediately have him punch out a
[48:00.340 --> 48:05.520]  window of a car and it just fucks him up like it's like this fucking suck. Like him being in the real
[48:05.520 --> 48:11.320]  world is just him getting his ass kicked. Part of the reason it wasn't so successful is it was too
[48:11.320 --> 48:16.500]  self-aware for the time. Yeah. I think the comedy was a little ahead of what people were ready for.
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.380]  Jeff, you're so right. You're so right. It was in ninety four. Is that what you said?
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.840]  Ninety three, I think. Ninety four. Yeah. It like that is so self-aware is not happening for like
[48:27.840 --> 48:33.900]  another decade. Yeah. Yeah. We needed grunge before we were ready to be self-aware. Yeah,
[48:33.900 --> 48:46.640]  definitely. Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And

[49:43.280 --> 49:49.560]  didn't land on where speed belongs, but... Oh yeah. Let's look at Edge of Tomorrow.
[49:50.020 --> 49:57.020]  I think Edge of Tomorrow is like... Oh man, I don't know. I'd put it below John Wick.
[49:57.020 --> 50:01.600]  I think I've seen that movie twice all the way through and I can't remember one thing about it
[50:01.600 --> 50:07.880]  other than I really like it. I remember the aliens move and all cool like. Yeah, I remember when he
[50:07.880 --> 50:11.880]  talks to the general and he goes, we've had this conversation before like so many times or whatever
[50:11.880 --> 50:17.300]  and that that's the one. I don't know why that part sticks out in my head, but it does. It's
[50:17.300 --> 50:22.480]  really good, but I don't... It's so weird where like I don't feel deeply about it, but it is really
[50:22.480 --> 50:28.940]  good. 26? No, I'd put it at like 18, I think. Yeah, 18. Yeah, like I think that's a totally
[50:28.940 --> 50:35.720]  fine range. Sure. Okay, now I'm gonna throw Ambulance out there. Any thoughts on Ambulance?
[50:36.100 --> 50:45.220]  Never seen it. I would put it in the 20 to 31 range. 28? Personally. I love it. I love Ambulance.
[50:45.320 --> 50:49.320]  I'll put it at 28. I love Ambulance. There's some good action. There's some cool shots
[50:49.320 --> 50:56.800]  overall, though. It is... It's... Holy shit. It is so... It's Mike... It feels like Michael Bay.
[50:57.120 --> 51:03.440]  The whole like surgery over FaceTime with the doctor. Oh, shut up. It explodes, like the
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.680]  pancreas or whatever explodes. And then it goes into like drone shots and then they paint the
[51:08.680 --> 51:13.180]  ambulance green. And I still... I've seen the movie a couple times. I still don't know why
[51:13.180 --> 51:18.020]  they paint it green. Why? No idea. Especially if they're trying to go out with all the other
[51:18.020 --> 51:23.020]  ambulances. It's the one ambulance that's fucking green. It's... It's so good. I love it.
[51:23.040 --> 51:29.400]  I'll put it at 28, but I think it belongs much higher. No. Eric, I sent you the picture of the...
[51:29.400 --> 51:35.940]  of me and the guy who did the FPV shots. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So awesome. I love that it was like
[51:35.940 --> 51:40.960]  just so many drone shots. It's Michael Bay going, oh, you think I fell off? Check this out. And
[51:40.960 --> 51:46.620]  you're just like, what happened? Where's this going? It goes everywhere. It's awesome. Let's
[51:47.640 --> 51:54.800]  Kingsman Secret Service. Woo. I think that's a really good movie. It's like all the way through.
[51:54.880 --> 52:00.760]  There's no lulls. There's no weak points in it. It's a lot of fun. I'd put it pretty high. I'd put
[52:00.760 --> 52:07.280]  it in the top 15 or top 20 rather. Sorry. Top 20. I'd put it 19. Sure. I'd do 19 or 16. Yeah.
[52:07.480 --> 52:13.500]  The way we're talking about sequels, it... the first one to me has like people so loudly hated
[52:13.500 --> 52:17.880]  the sequels that it is tainted my memory of the first, which is not fair to that movie.
[52:18.160 --> 52:23.560]  Well, yeah, I mean, people hated Robocop 2 and 3 and Predator 2, but we're not punishing those
[52:23.560 --> 52:27.880]  guys at the top, you know, or Die Hard 2. No, but I'm just saying when I think of Kingsman,
[52:28.200 --> 52:32.840]  like it is detracted from it. I'm just saying for me personally, I'm not saying that that is
[52:32.840 --> 52:38.700]  a negative, but just the the feedback around Kingsman turned so bad that like I don't have
[52:38.700 --> 52:42.980]  the enthusiasm for it as a whole that I know I definitely had when I saw the first one.
[52:42.980 --> 52:47.840]  It was the only one that existed. I feel like the narrative of those movies changed because of
[52:47.840 --> 52:50.560]  the impacts of the sequels. Sounds a little negative.
[52:51.720 --> 52:55.100]  I am just saying for me, I'm not arguing that it shouldn't be wherever it is.
[52:55.460 --> 53:00.220]  That is just how I feel about it. But I'm not arguing that it should be higher or lower based
[53:00.220 --> 53:04.880]  on that. I'd be fine with 19. Yeah, 19 seems fine to me. You can live with that. I think it
[53:04.880 --> 53:08.240]  could be higher, but I think that's fine. Yeah, I could think I think it could be a little higher
[53:08.240 --> 53:15.960]  too, but 19 is fine. Commando. Oh, number one, probably. It's high. It kind of it kind of
[53:15.960 --> 53:20.500]  shepherded the genre in. I could put it I could I could definitely right here, like putting it at
[53:20.500 --> 53:25.480]  10 and fighting out. Yeah, we can do that. We can do that. Absolutely. The thing with Commando is
[53:25.480 --> 53:30.860]  it's so the beginning of it is so fucking awesome and the end of it is so fucking awesome. But
[53:30.860 --> 53:36.480]  there's this middle that sucks. I agree with you. I agree with you. I I'm hard pressed to say that
[53:36.480 --> 53:43.640]  the middle sucks, but boys, it's slow. Definitely drags. It just is. They go to hijack a plane and
[53:43.640 --> 53:50.520]  that whole sequence is just so boring. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds fun on paper. It does. It is us getting
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.620]  Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero for the first time, though. It's pretty good. It's a lot
[53:54.620 --> 54:04.000]  of fun. We still need somewhere to put speed. I think speed is top 15. 16? I go 16. I go 16.
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.180]  I think speed's at 11. I think speed's a top 10 movie, but I put speed at 11. I you know,
[54:09.600 --> 54:14.860]  looking at this list, I'm really happy with the idea of like John Wick being the 15 line of like
[54:14.860 --> 54:20.100]  things above and below. I think sort of grouping it is like a top 15. I'm good with top 15
[54:20.100 --> 54:24.940]  personally. Anywhere in the top 15. Jeff? I don't know. For me, speed 2 was such a disappointment.
[54:24.940 --> 54:32.840]  It tarnished the first one. Come on. I can't. I just. Fine, 11. I'll pretend like speed 2 didn't
[54:32.840 --> 54:38.700]  happen. Yeah, why not? We'll do it. Keep going down the list. Gladiator. I could see it at like
[54:38.700 --> 54:45.360]  12, 13, somewhere like around here. But also, I don't think of it as like an action movie. I
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.340]  think of all the parts in that movie that are action when I think of it. So I could see it going
[54:49.340 --> 54:53.620]  a little bit lower. When I think about that movie, I just think of fucking wheat fields
[54:53.620 --> 54:57.760]  blowing slowly in the wind. Me too, and his hand dragging through it and everything. That's all
[54:57.760 --> 55:03.640]  that I remember about that fucking film. Bury it, bury it, as far as I'm concerned. What? 27.
[55:05.240 --> 55:11.720]  I'd take 16. Ralphie loved it. 16 is probably fine. Okay. It's a beloved film. A lot of these
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.680]  top 10s I loved as a, as like a 13 year old. I didn't love Gladiator because of all the chatting.
[55:17.680 --> 55:26.400]  Yeah. I'm so glad 300 didn't make the list. That's awesome. I'm going to work from bottom
[55:27.040 --> 55:31.900]  up here. Yes, Madam Super Cops, you guys have never seen, but it is, it rocks. And I would
[55:31.900 --> 55:38.420]  love to show you a fight sequence from that and you go, holy shit. I love it. I love it. Yeah,
[55:38.460 --> 55:42.780]  I have no problem with it being higher. I just haven't seen it, but I trust that it's great.
[55:42.780 --> 55:50.960]  I, I really, it's Michelle Yao before she's doing everything all at once or whatever. And she's
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.460]  the coolest fuck. Oh, her action stuff is so awesome. And Cynthia Rothrock, absolutely underrated.
[55:56.640 --> 56:03.380]  She's so cool. Aren't the Super Cops, aren't they like the police story movies? That police story
[56:03.380 --> 56:09.200]  three, I think is called Super Cops. She's in that, right? And she's in that, and it's not
[56:09.920 --> 56:15.320]  connected. I think Yes, Madam is the name of the movie. And then in America, they titled it Super
[56:15.320 --> 56:20.140]  Cops, uh, because they tried to, it's like a Hong Kong action movie and they tried to like, let's
[56:20.140 --> 56:24.000]  just call it this. And then it was probably in connection with that. Cause that's probably when
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.660]  it was released. I would think. Warriors. I love it, but I could definitely see you guys putting
[56:29.660 --> 56:34.580]  it lower on the list and I'm not going to fight super hard. I love it too. It's really fun.
[56:34.940 --> 56:38.700]  I just think it's, it's segmented. It tells such a great story. All the characters are
[56:38.700 --> 56:44.560]  really cool. I, I really, really love warriors. I would be okay with putting it above the rundown
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.840]  and the last action here, personally, as the person who picked those two. So you're talking
[56:48.840 --> 56:54.420]  about moving these down a spot and then yeah, moving down. That's fine. I'm not going to try
[56:54.420 --> 57:00.220]  to move action Jackson down below as well, but no, you can't. It has action in the title. You
[57:00.220 --> 57:06.340]  don't want to split up the actions. No, no, it wouldn't make any sense. Uh, raid two. If it's
[57:06.340 --> 57:14.060]  between one, 12 and 27, it's top 15. What's it about? I agree. Um, I don't think I've ever heard
[57:14.060 --> 57:23.200]  of it. What was raid one about? Okay. So the raid one is about a SWAT team essentially taking over
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.760]  a building that is run by a drug lord and they have to get to the top floor kicking ass every
[57:28.760 --> 57:34.620]  step along the way. The raid two is a continuation of the lead of that story going back down the
[57:34.620 --> 57:42.480]  building. He does. It is like an undercover cop story. That's fucking awesome. Okay. Do you need
[57:42.480 --> 57:47.040]  to see the raid one to enjoy the raid two? No, I don't think you, I don't think you have to. I
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.740]  think it definitely adds to it, but I don't think, but I think raid two is so out, like the action is
[57:51.740 --> 57:56.440]  so cool that like, yeah, there's that bit where he's getting like stuffed into the, was it like
[57:56.440 --> 58:03.060]  a stall? He's like fighting. I saw raid two before one and I thought the order was fine. And I could,
[58:03.060 --> 58:07.440]  I could be wrong. I, I think they reuse actors between them. Like I think they're
[58:07.440 --> 58:11.460]  characters that maybe die, but I could be wrong about that. I like that. It seems like such a
[58:11.460 --> 58:17.680]  foreign film franchise, but it's made by a guy from Wales. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah.
[58:17.960 --> 58:22.100]  Oh, that's weird. Great. Um, okay. Here's the thing I want to put, cause I'm looking at what
[58:22.100 --> 58:29.320]  we have left. It's raid two, air force one and crank two. And I want to put raid two. I'm not
[58:29.320 --> 58:33.540]  saying it goes at number one. I'm saying we need something in the top 10 so we can juggle around
[58:33.540 --> 58:40.020]  this top 10. Not crank two or air force one. Exactly. Yes. Okay, cool. That's, that's what I
[58:40.020 --> 58:51.100]  was driving at. Um, so crank two, I think, Oh man, between 12 and 27. I think so too. I don't
[58:51.100 --> 58:55.440]  mind wherever it's placed. I think it personally, it should be higher. I don't think air force one
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.960]  is 12. No, it's certainly not. No. Air force one is definitely at the bottom. It's a lot of things
[59:00.960 --> 59:05.700]  sliding up. Yeah. I think things will have to slide up maybe from like 24. Okay. So let's,
[59:05.980 --> 59:09.560]  so let's start sliding because we got air force one. We got to put this somewhere. So where do
[59:09.560 --> 59:18.040]  you think this goes? 23 and then everything else. I love that Nick wants his. Yeah. And everything
[59:18.040 --> 59:27.820]  up goes up. Yeah. Okay. Action Jackson now in at 21. That makes sense. Yeah. All right. And.
[59:28.160 --> 59:33.380]  Okay. Done. I think that's the list. Number one. Okay. So now let's look at the top.
[59:33.760 --> 59:38.780]  Let's look at this top 10. I would immediately swap four with two. Yes. Yes. Definitely.
[59:39.580 --> 59:43.140]  Definitely. Definitely. Now here's the, now here's what I'm looking at. I think terminator
[59:43.140 --> 59:47.340]  one should be number one. Terminator one should be number one. I'm sorry. Terminator two should
[59:47.340 --> 59:50.440]  be number one. I, you know what? I'd go with that. I wouldn't fight you on that. Yeah. It's
[59:50.440 --> 59:55.540]  so iconic that like, I'm not going to fight that. Would it personally be mine? No, but like, I think
[59:55.540 --> 01:00:04.200]  it is like such a classic action. Great movie. It's great. Cool. Somebody else could do this
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:09.580]  next time. I can't wait. I can't wait for the audience. Terminator poster. He typoed bad boys
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:22.800]  is like bad buoys. Bad buoys. I think diehard should be higher. I love, I love diehard.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:29.200]  I love diehard. I think diehard is a better movie than Robocop. I agree. I would, I would swap
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.940]  Robocop and diehard. I'm fine with that. I'm fine with that too. I guess. Yeah. Now I personally
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:40.360]  think predator is a better film than diehard. Really? I would have predator top five. I think
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.380]  predator number three. I'm really, I'm feeling good about. I think, I think it's good. I think
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:50.820]  bad boys too belongs above the raid, right? Uh, shit. We got heat on here. Fuck. Yeah. It's,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.800]  this is where it gets tough. Jeff, anything stick out to you on this list that you think like on
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.860]  like the top 10 that you think should definitely shift? The only other thing I would switch is I
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.580]  think casino royale and heat. I would flip personally. You think that's, that's the only
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.780]  swap there? I'm not, I'm not opposed to that. I just, I, yeah, I think it's a slight, I mean,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:15.200]  it's close, right? But I just think it's. Did I swap them? Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Like I was doing it
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.540]  and like zoned out. I don't know what happened. Um, I really liked the raid too. I'm okay with
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:26.420]  it sliding down just cause most people haven't seen it. I think bad boys too. I like more than
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:32.940]  raid too, but shit. But I like commando so much. Yeah. I'm okay with commando being a 10. Fuck.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.980]  It's a, it's a good fucking movie, but it's also very dated at this point. Okay. Now look at,
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:46.540]  look at our bottom of the top 10 commando, the rock heat, casino royale, Robocop. Any of these
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.860]  need to shift or you think that feels pretty good? I think I like that. I'm pretty okay with it. Yeah.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.760]  Like I, I just, I would need commando in the top 10. So I'm happy with it. Yeah. I'm down with that.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.680]  Gavin. Yeah. Now top five, bad boys too, raid too, predator, diehard, terminator. I could swap
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:09.080]  predator and diehard. Like looking at this, if, if, if heat isn't in this running, then I wouldn't
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.420]  be opposed to swapping predator with diehard. I think diehard is great. I love it, but I wouldn't
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.880]  put up much of a fight if somebody said predator belongs at two. I would be happy with putting
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.100]  predator too, but like, I'm also like diehard is great. Yeah. I would have predator too, but
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.400]  split, splitting hairs. Right. That's how this, that's how this feels. Like these two feel like
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.920]  they're on equal ground, but that equal ground is just a little bit lower than terminator too.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.360]  Yeah, for sure. I would put bad boys too above raid too, but that's just me. Oh,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.280]  raid too is just such, I mean. Raid too is so cool. It has a great car chase. Yeah. I'm fine
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.660]  with it. If, if that's where it belongs. Hammer, bad girl. Um, did we just do it? I think that's
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.220]  the top 10. Are we sure that Looney Tunes back in action doesn't need to move up anywhere?
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:59.780]  I would move it above action point personally. You're welcome. Uh, I'm okay with flipping it
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:04.700]  with action point. Okay, cool. I'm just happy action point made the top 30. I think that's fair.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:11.100]  Top 30 movies of all time. Have you seen a civil action, Jeff? Would you say it's better than
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:15.500]  ambulance? Uh, I haven't seen ambulance, so I can't compare. Yeah, you're missing out, dude. We
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.880]  gotta watch ambulance. You let me know. We'll find time. We'll watch it before the Tyson fight. I
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.760]  think, I think, I don't want to start any fights here. I don't want to start any fights here or
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.860]  anything, but I think Crank 2 is better than the Rundown. I agree with that. Yeah, I'd take that.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.200]  Well, listen, okay, I was thinking about it. The Rundown opens with The Rock beating up the
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.780]  offensive line of the Cowboys, which is fucking awesome. I get why Nick Slander's it. Not a Nick
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:45.800]  Slander. Oh, hidden agendas. Uh-huh. Just throwing that out there. Just floating it.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:51.660]  Cowboys beat themselves up. Okay, so that is true. Leave it to the professionals. By that,
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:56.500]  I mean themselves. Do we want to put Crank 2 at 24? Sure. Yeah, and then we just slide everything
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:03.360]  else down. Here's the thing. I'm happy with Crank 2 above the Rundown. I'm not happy with the
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.620]  Rundown below Hot Fuzz. No, no, no. These are shifting down. You think the Rundown's better
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.820]  than Hot Fuzz? Yes, I do. I think that's insanity. I agree with you on this. I think it's a better
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:15.600]  action movie. I mean, it sounds wrong, but I haven't seen the Rundown, so you could be right.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.300]  I will say this. Christopher Walken is so good in it. The Rundown is a good movie.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.100]  Okay. It's a lot of fun. Who's the sidekick? Sean William Scott. Sean William Scott and Rosario
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:33.940]  Dawson and Christopher Walken. And The Rock plays this debt collector, essentially, who doesn't use
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:40.300]  guns. Yeah. You know what? You're right. I was thinking of Walk Tall. Yep. You're on my board.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.540]  No. Yeah. Walk Tall. Fuck Walk Tall. Walk Tall sucks. That's the one with John Knoxville.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.880]  He's fighting dudes with whip in the Rundown. He wants to be a chef. You know that's a remake?
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:57.660]  Yeah. I was a big fan of those movies when I was a kid. The thing about the Rundown is I think it's
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:02.380]  like one of the last times The Rock has hair in a movie. It is. I think after that, he's like bald
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:08.720]  or in like a funny wig. It was the thing where they have Arnold Schwarzenegger passing the symbolic
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.580]  action movie torch to him in that movie. But then he signed a deal with Disney and just made
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.720]  kids movies for the next nine years. So it doesn't... the handoff didn't work. Nope. Anything
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.880]  else on this list you guys think should shift around? No, like I feel like the things that I
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.320]  haven't seen, I'm not going to fight for it, like fight against. Yeah. It's a solid list. I think
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.240]  this is a really good list. Yeah. I like it. It would be interesting. We won't do this because
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.640]  of the time commitment. It'd be interesting if we all watched all these movies and then came back
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.320]  to the list. I've seen most of them. So you want us to watch Looney Tunes back in action,
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.620]  simple action. No, I just said it would be interesting to re-rank them, but we should not
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:54.600]  do this. I don't know, it's only, what is that, 62 hours probably? Oh, is that it? Great. Great.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:02.000]  Then I think we did it. I think we have our top 31. Top 5 at number 5, Bad Boys 2 at number 4,
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.740]  Raid 2 at number 3 is Predator. Number 2 is Die Hard. Number 1, Terminator 2. Good list.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.360]  There are things in action movies sometimes where it's like action itself is not, you know,
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.440]  like it's a badass moment without action. That high five handshake thing at the beginning of
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:24.720]  Predator is so fucking cool. Yeah. Flexing. Oh, it's awesome. Jesse Ventura is so fucking awesome
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.240]  in that movie. How much, how many Terminator movies are there? Oh my god. 5? No, I think
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:38.420]  it's like 6 or 7, isn't it? 1, 2, 3, Salvation, Genesis, and 1, yeah, so like 6 or 7. Damn. 1,
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.520]  2, 3, 4, 5, there are 6 Terminator movies. I've got a lot of Terminators to watch. That's what
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:49.020]  I'm moving on to after I finish Aliens. No, no you don't. I do, I gotta see them all. I've never
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:57.480]  seen 4, 5, and 6. Much like Alien, you can stop at 2. Yeah. I mean, just, I don't know, you think
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.980]  Terminator Dark Fate is going to be worth your time? I gotta find out what happens in the universe.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:08.160]  It's in Gears of War 5, so Jeff has to see it. Oh, that's true, that is true. It is a big part
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.800]  of Gears. I saw Terminator Dark Fate in the theaters, and we went with a bunch of people
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:18.120]  from Rooster Teeth, and that was, remember Tobin, one of our designers? That was the first Terminator
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:25.700]  movie he ever saw. Oh no, so that was the last Terminator movie he ever saw? Learning, I had him
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:30.600]  do something for us, and I used Terminator 2 as a reference point, and learning later that he has
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.640]  never seen it is very funny to me. Nope, he saw, no, but you should have just said, it's like
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:43.620]  Terminator, you know, Dark Fate. You know, I've been watching, I watched Prometheus and Covenant,
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.480]  and then that got me really excited about just the alien universe, and so I did watch a bunch
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.940]  of YouTube videos to find out about the history and everything, and I thought, oh, I wonder if
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:56.740]  there's novelizations that are canon. Do you know how many alien books there are? A ton. Oh, that does not
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:04.040]  shock me. That are canon? Are they canon? Oh, really? Like 40? Oh my god, okay, that's more than I
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:09.440]  anticipated. They canonize them? Wow. Who decides what's canon and what isn't? I don't know, they're all
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.560]  supposed to be in the timeline, there's like a million of them, and they're all like, it's crazy,
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.960]  it's fucking crazy. I started to look into it last night, I thought, maybe I'll read an alien book,
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.920]  where do I start? And I just gave up, I was like, never mind, it's too much. Do you think Ridley
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.620]  Scott gets to make that call? Do you think he's sitting down looking at the novelizations, like he
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:30.060]  like puts on his glasses, like next to a fireplace, and he just has like a stack of alien books, and he's
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.900]  like, I'm gonna read all these and let you know which ones are real and not. I think, I think it
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.840]  probably has more to do with like how big the check is, honestly. I think that sounds, I think
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.120]  because they have like dark horse comic series that were canon that they've novelized and then made
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:50.600]  sequels to those novelizations. I mean, it's deep, it's weird. Right. I think that when you start
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.720]  getting into the canonization of stuff, I think it gets crazy. Because that was all Star Wars.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.960]  Yeah. Yes, it happened with Halo too. I read all those, and then I went, why did I read all these,
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:07.160]  you just said they're not canon. What was that, Timothy Zahn, was that his name? He wrote all
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.080]  those books, yeah. They just did away with it all, that was, that sucked. Yeah, that really sucked.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:17.540]  Now it's Legends instead of EU, Expanded Universe. Yep. Well, there you have it. Oh, we're
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:26.780]  in a fight scene. Oh. Watch this shit. Okay. Oh, we got a guy with two swords. He's swinging away.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.700]  You know what's a really great, if we're just talking about martial arts.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.560]  Have you guys ever seen the Street Fighter, the Sonny Chiba film, the Street Fighter? Yeah. No.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.740]  One of the best movies ever made. I would have, if I was doing my list,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.720]  god, legitimately, I would have had it on there. See, this is why I wanted this on the list.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:49.660]  Cynthia Rothrock, fucking rules. Watch this shit. Oh my god, this movie's so cool.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:58.400]  Sound design is awesome. Oh, it's so, this is just a genre of itself and it's so sick.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:07.300]  Unstoppable. Like, how many takes to do all this stuff? Oh my god, it's so cool. I think they said
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:12.700]  Yeah. One and done, baby. Just one. I love these movies because they do so much
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.240]  in, like, extended periods on a wide lens and you get to see, like, massive choreographed sections.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.740]  Yeah. Oh my god, it's so cool. Which you don't ever really get on Hollywood movies.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:26.000]  And then, isn't it, it's crazy that the- Oh shit. Through the glass.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.480]  And then the star of this movie
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:41.580]  is now, like, a Hollywood, she's in everything. Yeah. I don't know. This rocks. This is so cool.
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:44.440]  Yeah, this is very cool. I think we talked about this in the other one. When she was in a James
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:49.480]  Bond film, they had to bring in, like, the, her stunt team, the Jackie Chan stunt team,
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.060]  because she was just punching all the Hollywood stunt guys for real. Oh, it's so sick. Oh my god,
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:00.920]  it's so cool. So cool. Oh, fucking awesome. When I was a kid on Sunday mornings, they had
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.280]  Kung Fu Theater, and they would show two movies early Sunday morning, and I'd get up every Sunday
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.820]  morning to watch it. That is one of the most enjoyable rituals I had in my life. I would,
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:16.380]  I'm being serious here, I would genuinely consider do it, turning that into a show where we got
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:20.580]  together and watched Kung Fu films together on Sunday mornings. Oh my god. Just as a live stream.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:26.420]  Jeff, I have a hard drive. Oh, Jeff, I have a hard drive. You ever watch Fist Fighter from
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:31.920]  89 or Death Promise? Oh my god, I want to show you Parole Violators. I want to show you Future
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.980]  Kick. Oh, this is going to be so sick. Dude, I would love, and I can pull some of the old ones
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.300]  that I used to watch when I was a kid, I would fucking love for us to get together and do that
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:43.940]  in some way. Let's do it. Just like Kung Fu Theater or like Martial Arts Madness or something,
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.860]  you know? That would be so cool. I think we're good with the list. Yeah, I think it's a great
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:52.380]  list. Way to go. Yeah, so much fun. Yeah, this is awesome. We need to do this again. It's sort
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:58.900]  of like, as you said, Jeff, the 98 thing. But this is the first episode of Action Movie Ranker.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:04.420]  What will we rank next? I don't know. We'll find out. But until then, thank you so much for
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:10.440]  listening. Make sure to check out our Patreon at The Regulation Pod. We do gameplays at also
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.600]  Regulation Gameplay, I believe is the name of that channel. We do streams, we do all sorts of stuff.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.720]  But thank you so much for listening. Check those things out. Have a great rest of your day.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.800]  Does everybody like six different cheeses? Ooh, I can I can rank some cheeses, dude. Absolutely.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.980]  That's that's a drop though. We're gonna have our cheeses stolen. Bye.
