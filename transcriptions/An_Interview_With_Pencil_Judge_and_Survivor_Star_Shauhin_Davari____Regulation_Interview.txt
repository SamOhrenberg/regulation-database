[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[00:04.800 --> 00:09.860]  blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar
[00:09.860 --> 00:14.760]  cold foam. Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.160 --> 00:21.520]  Hello and welcome to a special regulation supplemental for the first time in our
[00:21.520 --> 00:25.920]  show's history. This is big. We have a guest. We've never done this. We've been very
[00:25.920 --> 00:32.080]  anti-guest in our history. Let me just jump in real quick and say that you need to eat the
[00:32.080 --> 00:40.000]  damn pencil, man. No! You understand? No! Right now. Never! Never! I'm sending you fried pencil.
[00:40.200 --> 00:45.420]  I'll even fry it up with pico de gallo and send it to you. But do you have any idea how many of
[00:45.420 --> 00:51.100]  your listeners are popping into my comments? They literally have gone on to my mother's Instagram
[00:51.100 --> 00:59.540]  page. No! Can you tell Shaheen to tell Andrew to eat the pencil? No! And I don't know how these...
[00:59.540 --> 01:04.780]  First of all, thank you regulation podcast listeners. I am thrilled every time I see
[01:04.780 --> 01:10.140]  a comment that tells me to tell you to eat the pencil. And listen man, it's okay. You
[01:10.140 --> 01:18.240]  cannot eat the pencil. You just have to say, I am not a man of my word. You should never make a bet
[01:18.240 --> 01:24.880]  with Andrew. As long as you say those things and then we can record it and then we can play it at
[01:24.880 --> 01:33.400]  your funeral. Uh-huh. No one can, you know, be confused. First of all, I'd like to counter with
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.220]  I'm an honorable man. Second of all, all of these comments are kind of your fault. If you would have
[01:38.220 --> 01:42.300]  gave the other ruling, nobody would be submitting it. So that's kind of on you. That's not how this
[01:42.300 --> 01:47.140]  works, Andrew. I think that what needs to happen is you need to eat the pencil, not for us, but
[01:47.140 --> 01:52.840]  to alleviate the pressure on Shaheen and his family. Seriously. That you have unduly put upon
[01:52.840 --> 01:59.060]  them. You know, I once again, I blame the ruling, less so my lack of action. Yeah. I want everyone
[01:59.060 --> 02:06.940]  to know, I know this is not a video podcast, but I did bring a pencil. I'm holding it the entire
[02:06.940 --> 02:13.200]  time. Interestingly, it's it is a pencil. It doesn't have an eraser. So I even removed the eraser.
[02:13.200 --> 02:19.200]  Wow. I know. I'd be more concerned about the metal part than the eraser, but I appreciate
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.440]  the eraser removal. Yeah, no problem. Any, any, anything I can do for you.
[02:25.300 --> 02:31.160]  Also, I am thrilled that you now know how seasons work. I am just.
[02:34.060 --> 02:36.800]  That wasn't a long time for you. I did that for you.
[02:37.100 --> 02:41.640]  Thank you. That was important to you. I wanted to make sure my real name is Shaheen. It's not,
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.320]  it's not a stage name. That's my real name. Oh, that's great. Yeah. It means Royal White Falcon.
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.940]  I know you're protected by Falcons. That's incredible. That was another
[02:49.940 --> 02:57.100]  layer of just absurdity around all of this. Yeah. The, the similarities are striking.
[02:57.580 --> 03:03.760]  Okay. Oh, I'm, I'm which similarities? Well, we are a podcast that is protected by Falcons
[03:03.760 --> 03:07.700]  and Falcon is your name. I don't know if you know this, but we discovered, we went to,
[03:07.700 --> 03:13.640]  we went to a hotel in Mexico for a vacation two years ago and we kept seeing this guy walk around
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.960]  with a hooded Falcon around the pool and stuff. So we went up, finally, we got up the courage to
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.580]  talk to him and he said, yeah, the hotel is protected by this Falcon. It keeps the birds
[03:22.580 --> 03:28.820]  away. Then we found out there's an entire industry where large hotels have full-time Falcon staffs
[03:28.820 --> 03:34.760]  to keep birds and pests away on the beach. And it really opened our world. So now we've,
[03:34.760 --> 03:39.580]  we've decided that the Falcon would be the appropriate protector of our podcast. And then
[03:39.580 --> 03:45.680]  here we are talking to the Royal White Falcon. Yeah, exactly right. And just like for the
[03:45.680 --> 03:49.920]  absurdity, for your context, like Survivor, probably the most important show in my life.
[03:50.020 --> 03:55.380]  Like I started watching first season when I was like five or six. It is something that I would
[03:55.380 --> 04:01.660]  watch every week with my mom. It was like one of the most important shows for me. So the fact that
[04:01.660 --> 04:09.100]  you of all people end up on Survivor and also have this strange connection where as much as
[04:09.100 --> 04:13.920]  you're talking about being hounded about Eat the Pencil, I get it constantly on all forms. It's
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.500]  something I live with. So to learn that you were going to be on the show was so just absurd. Like
[04:19.500 --> 04:25.660]  the world doesn't make sense. Yeah. I share that with you too, man. I watched Survivor with my mom.
[04:25.660 --> 04:31.240]  It was during the pandemic. And, you know, we had just like middle of the pandemic, lost my
[04:31.240 --> 04:37.880]  father. And it was like, my mom also just had a back surgery. And so she couldn't go anywhere.
[04:37.880 --> 04:43.100]  And her mind was just consumed with this garbage. And she couldn't get through anything. And so I
[04:43.100 --> 04:48.060]  was like, Mom, watch Survivor. Like, yeah, down and watch Survivor. It's so fun. And it's such a
[04:48.060 --> 04:52.740]  good show for you. Because, you know, my mom was a hairstylist for forever, which is just a game of
[04:52.740 --> 05:02.380]  backstabbing people. And my mom would, my mom would get to the hair salon. And like, when people's
[05:02.380 --> 05:07.880]  clients would come in, she would, she would be the one scheduling them, right? She'd be the first
[05:07.880 --> 05:12.140]  chair. And so she would pick up the phone when the receptionist wasn't there. And she would schedule
[05:12.140 --> 05:18.340]  the clients for time when they're when they weren't there. So they would show up. And my mom would be
[05:18.340 --> 05:22.020]  like, Oh, they're not here. You know, they do this all the time. Why don't you just go ahead and sit
[05:22.020 --> 05:30.420]  in my chair? And so that's, that's like, where, you know, my, I was like, Okay, Mom, you got to
[05:30.420 --> 05:35.020]  watch this show. Because this is, this is just that on television. Right up your alley. Yeah.
[05:36.860 --> 05:42.200]  Awesome. Yeah. I have a question regarding like someone who's watched the show. Was there a moment
[05:42.200 --> 05:46.640]  or experience that you anticipated as a viewer? Because Survivor has like, all these things that
[05:46.640 --> 05:51.180]  you kind of expect to hit on, if you're gonna be on the show, that still surprised you by how it
[05:51.180 --> 05:59.460]  felt as a player? Like, you saw it coming? Yes, yes. When you're sitting there, it feels very
[05:59.460 --> 06:06.500]  different when Jeff says, and one of you is not going to make the jury. Okay. Because like, when
[06:06.500 --> 06:10.820]  when you're at that, there's so in Survivor, there's a challenge where you know, you're split
[06:10.820 --> 06:17.600]  into two tribes, and the team that loses the tribe that loses the challenge goes to tribal and that's
[06:17.600 --> 06:22.420]  the last person who's not going to make the jury, even though they've made the merge, which is like
[06:22.420 --> 06:29.720]  one step in the game. Stuff like that hits a lot harder when you're out there versus when you're
[06:29.720 --> 06:33.540]  sitting on your couch, like, Oh, someone doesn't make the jury, like, who cares. But when it's you
[06:33.540 --> 06:38.080]  and you're looking down the line, and you're looking at David with his gleaming muscles,
[06:38.080 --> 06:41.720]  and you have to hold on to a thing. And you're like, All right, well, I'm not winning the
[06:41.720 --> 06:47.200]  challenge. I hope that he wins the overall thing. It's like, that type of stuff when he says, Oh,
[06:47.200 --> 06:52.360]  you're gonna have fried chicken and waffles and you haven't eaten in 16 days. You're like,
[06:52.880 --> 06:57.880]  you know, I had a croissant up into that point. I had one chocolate croissant and half a vegan
[06:57.880 --> 07:03.240]  donut, which by the way, when they told me it was a vegan donut, I nearly was like, get Jeff to the
[07:03.240 --> 07:12.520]  island right now. Give me a real damn donut. But yeah, it was like, you know, that type of stuff
[07:12.520 --> 07:19.440]  talking about like, you're gonna have this food, dude, you haven't eaten in 12 days, and you just
[07:19.440 --> 07:23.800]  want something to eat. And so the excitement that you see, even though you know, these things are
[07:23.800 --> 07:28.820]  coming is very real. And it's, it's visceral for someone who's out there, in a way that it just
[07:28.820 --> 07:33.700]  can't be for someone who's sitting on the couch. Yeah, that's such a the jury line is so interesting.
[07:33.860 --> 07:38.980]  As a viewer, like I understand like, Oh, man, that sucks. I guess like you're going home,
[07:38.980 --> 07:42.900]  doesn't the significance of because it's when you're watching it, it's all about winning,
[07:43.160 --> 07:48.860]  largely. So the idea that there's a stakes difference between how you lose is not present
[07:48.860 --> 07:53.660]  when you're not like feeling it and going through those emotions and trying your best to advance.
[07:54.320 --> 07:58.100]  When you think about it, you're if you're on the jury, you're on every episode, first of all,
[07:58.220 --> 08:03.520]  that is not something that I thought about until I was out there. Wait, if you're on the jury,
[08:03.520 --> 08:09.260]  you're going to be on every episode. But more importantly than that, you get like when he says
[08:09.260 --> 08:14.120]  you get to have a say and who wins the million dollars and who has the title of sole survivor.
[08:14.920 --> 08:19.100]  That doesn't mean anything to the audience. Yeah, but it does mean something to you when
[08:19.100 --> 08:23.660]  you're out there. You're one of eight people that gets to vote on who gets a Millie. You're one of
[08:23.660 --> 08:28.160]  eight people that gets to vote who gets to win your season, because it's your season, right?
[08:28.440 --> 08:31.980]  Yeah. And that goes into the voting, I think more than the viewers would think to like,
[08:32.520 --> 08:38.580]  a lot of what I was voting for was who I wanted to make sure won the season. Because I didn't,
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.760]  I wanted to make sure that we were represented by the right season winner. Sure. You know,
[08:42.900 --> 08:47.740]  like that, that that matters a lot. Yeah. Oh, that makes total sense. That's so interesting.
[08:48.180 --> 08:51.660]  I'm curious, on the other end of it now having played the game,
[08:51.780 --> 08:55.500]  has that changed your perception of previous seasons you've watched?
[08:56.060 --> 09:02.380]  Oh, that's an interesting question. I extend a lot more respect for anyone
[09:02.380 --> 09:08.420]  who has played the game. And, you know, a lot of people are like, Oh, oh, gosh, yes.
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.780]  What drives me nuts now that didn't before and I was probably guilty of it before,
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.160]  was people saying, why would they do that?
[09:18.960 --> 09:27.400]  Why would they do that? How about answer the question? That's what drives me nuts.
[09:27.880 --> 09:33.380]  If you want to watch the show, or any reality television show, stop assuming these people are
[09:33.380 --> 09:40.740]  stupid, and start answering your question. Why would he do this? Oh, let me answer the question.
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.820]  And I'll be a much better watcher of the television show. Because by providing an answer
[09:45.820 --> 09:52.320]  that assumes the person isn't a moron, you're going to get better at your own mental strategy.
[09:52.740 --> 09:56.940]  What are the reasons this person could do this? People got mad at Bianca for telling Cedric that
[09:56.940 --> 10:01.200]  she lost her vote. Okay, well, what would you have done in a situation he voted out the person
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.560]  who lied to him the first time and the whole entire time he's talking about that for me?
[10:04.820 --> 10:10.840]  Why did you search Kyle's bag? Well, I wanted to show Camilla that I trusted her, because we were
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.120]  going to work together throughout the rest of the game. You don't see the three hour conversation
[10:15.120 --> 10:20.540]  that Camilla and I had, right? You can't, you just can't. And so a lot of these, what changed
[10:20.540 --> 10:25.940]  for me was I extend a lot more respect towards the people who have played games like this,
[10:26.540 --> 10:32.020]  knowing that a lot of stuff is just, it just has to be left on the editing floor. We're talking
[10:32.020 --> 10:38.300]  about 1700 hours plus of footage, something like that, and only 13 hours get shown. That's, and
[10:38.300 --> 10:43.800]  like, you know, another hour of that is just them showing cool animals and shit. A lot of snakes.
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.040]  And on my season, like 15 minutes of that was them just showing, you know, David and Joe's pets.
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.120]  Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Speaking of leaving stuff on the editing floor, how do you leave the
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.640]  emotions and the feelings on the island when you come back? Because now you're in this exclusive
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.200]  club, which you'll be in for the rest of your life. You know, the survivor club of, I think
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.100]  there's less than 800 people that have played it across the entirety of it. And I assume that a
[11:09.100 --> 11:14.340]  survivor becomes a part of your life going forward. And you're going to interact and deal
[11:14.340 --> 11:20.320]  with like Kyle, for example, who framed you very famously. How do you put that aside or leave that
[11:20.320 --> 11:23.700]  on the island and main, like have a friendly relationship going forward? Or is that even
[11:23.700 --> 11:28.080]  possible? You don't leave it on the island. You have to work through the emotion.
[11:28.500 --> 11:28.620]  Yeah.
[11:28.700 --> 11:33.460]  You can't just like cut it off and then, oh, I'm fine. No, no, no. You've got to work through that.
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.820]  You have to have the difficult conversation. You have to navigate that stuff. And you have to
[11:39.900 --> 11:45.040]  work through your emotions in a lot of different ways for me personally. And I think this is a
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.380]  personal journey for everyone. There are people and there are moments that are like unforgivable,
[11:49.720 --> 11:53.660]  right? And that's part of the thing that you sign up for when you go out there. It's like,
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.080]  okay, that's just unforgivable. I'm never going to be friends with that person or talk to that
[11:57.080 --> 12:02.080]  person or be around that person. And that's the way it goes. And actually my recommendation to
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.620]  people who are going to go out there is really continually remind yourself, you're never going
[12:07.620 --> 12:08.580]  to talk to these people again.
[12:08.580 --> 12:09.200]  Yeah.
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.480]  Try and play that way. And that doesn't mean don't get close to them. That means get close
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.680]  to them with the idea that you're never going to talk to these people again in the back of your
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.340]  mind always. And that's kind of what I did every morning. If you go back and watch the show,
[12:21.860 --> 12:26.640]  every morning, you will see me like opening my palms and closing my eyes. And I'm accepting
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.060]  my vibes from home. I told people from home, send me good vibes, right? And I was accepting those
[12:31.060 --> 12:37.860]  vibes at sunrise every single morning. And what that really was for me was a reminder of why I was
[12:37.860 --> 12:43.260]  out there and who was important to me while I was out there. Those people back home are important
[12:43.260 --> 12:54.080]  to me. Now, how do I compartmentalize? I journaled my ass off when I got back, right? And while I was
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.280]  out there, when I got voted out of the game, I journaled a ton. I meditate every single day. I
[12:58.280 --> 13:04.780]  do breath work every single day. That stuff allows emotional processing, journaling, meditation,
[13:04.780 --> 13:09.300]  breath work, that stuff allows for emotional processing in a really profound way because
[13:09.300 --> 13:14.700]  you're just taking that weight off of your head, right? You're just moving away every time you do
[13:14.700 --> 13:19.760]  some meditation or some breath work or journaling or whatever. You're removing that mental weight
[13:19.760 --> 13:23.820]  because you're downloading it into your journal or you're getting rid of it through your body.
[13:24.180 --> 13:28.480]  And then you have to have difficult conversations. You have to navigate really difficult
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.000]  conversations. Joe and I had a very difficult, very long conversation where we talked about
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.720]  why he decided to believe Kyle over me and why we had that bad day and why we didn't work it out and
[13:41.720 --> 13:51.020]  why he did the vote that he did. And on the other side of that is strength in connection,
[13:51.460 --> 13:56.780]  that through that, you can have a stronger connection. And I think Joe and I have a really
[13:56.780 --> 14:01.380]  strong connection. And Kyle and I do too. I'm super proud of the game that he played. He played
[14:01.380 --> 14:09.620]  an amazing game. And I'm a different dude when it comes to stuff like that too. I understood what I
[14:09.620 --> 14:15.240]  was going out there to do. I think it's harder if you are maybe not as emotionally prepared,
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.720]  maybe don't have as many tools. That stuff tends to be harder. But I knew I was going out there
[14:20.720 --> 14:26.000]  to play a game. I knew the chances were that I was going to get fucked over and I was going to
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.900]  have to deal with that. And meanwhile, they put 18 of the coolest motherfuckers on planet earth
[14:31.900 --> 14:37.120]  on a television show with me. And so it's like, okay, cool. I did lose. And now I'm also going
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.180]  to sacrifice being friends with someone like Joe Hunter. Joe is one of the coolest, sweetest,
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.560]  kindest, best dudes on planet earth. And you're going to lose the show and lose a friendship.
[14:46.800 --> 14:51.100]  That doesn't make any sense to me personally. Well, I would imagine too, the connections that
[14:51.100 --> 14:55.860]  you're making there are so intense and so real. I liken it to going through basic training in
[14:55.860 --> 14:59.840]  the military, which I did when I was very young. You develop these intense bonds with people
[14:59.840 --> 15:06.500]  because you're together 24 hours a day, which is like skipping three years of a relationship.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.160]  Totally. Yeah. I would say it's more like each day is probably around half a year.
[15:13.160 --> 15:13.860]  Okay. Yeah.
[15:14.120 --> 15:16.280]  Of friendship in the regular world. So...
[15:16.280 --> 15:17.820]  But then at the same time...
[15:17.820 --> 15:20.840]  23 days around 12 years is how long I feel like I've known Joe Hunter.
[15:21.060 --> 15:25.520]  At the same time as you're getting closer and probably falling in love with these people to
[15:25.520 --> 15:30.160]  some degree and developing potentially lifelong friendships, you're also working against each
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.440]  other knowing they're working against you. And that's just an environment that a person doesn't
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.060]  find themselves in throughout the course of their life. Typically, I think it must...
[15:39.060 --> 15:41.000]  Yeah. It's got to do a number on you emotionally.
[15:41.420 --> 15:48.860]  Yeah. Yeah. For sure. You're provided a therapist from CBS after the show because there's a lot of
[15:48.860 --> 15:52.340]  processing that you have to do in order to understand like, okay, it's a game. I mean,
[15:52.340 --> 15:57.320]  when I came back, I was lingering around conversations the same way I would linger
[15:57.320 --> 16:01.080]  on conversations around camp. So instead of being like, all right, guys, bye. I'd be like,
[16:01.140 --> 16:05.860]  all right, guys, bye. And then I would like duck around the corner and put my ear...
[16:08.260 --> 16:12.440]  How long do you feel like normal, old, regular Sheen again after coming back?
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.660]  So I imagine your relationship with food is different for a while too.
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.340]  Oh, absolutely.
[16:15.820 --> 16:21.600]  No, no, there's no feeling normal again.
[16:22.040 --> 16:22.400]  Interesting.
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.940]  It's in your brain now, right? Someone said it to me the other day and I can't remember who it was.
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.380]  I wish I could because it was so good. But you're going on Survivor, your life is going to change.
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.260]  So if you like everything about your life, if you don't want your life to change,
[16:40.400 --> 16:45.340]  don't go on Survivor. It's life changing. So there is the before time and there is the after
[16:45.340 --> 16:51.120]  time. Like for example, I used to go by Shaw with a lot of my friends, like people that knew me,
[16:51.120 --> 16:59.200]  even when I was at the college. And when I came back after 30 something days total,
[16:59.740 --> 17:04.740]  the only thing that I ever told production my name was, was Shaheen. I never told them that I went by
[17:04.740 --> 17:08.660]  Shaw because I didn't want to be called Shaw out there. I wanted to be called Shaheen. It mattered
[17:08.660 --> 17:14.900]  to me. Culturally, it was important to me to be called Shaheen out there. And when I came back
[17:14.900 --> 17:20.120]  and my friends that had been calling me that for a long time called me that again, it was like
[17:20.120 --> 17:25.260]  nails on a chalkboard all of a sudden. Oh, whoa, don't, I can't be that guy anymore. That guy is
[17:25.260 --> 17:33.400]  gone for sure. And you know, Shaheen has risen from the ashes, if you will. So yeah, your life
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.200]  is going to change. My relationship with food is different. There's many times now where it's like,
[17:37.300 --> 17:44.760]  I'm hungry and I just don't need to eat. I am hungry. I don't need to eat. And so if I'm in
[17:44.760 --> 17:49.540]  the middle of something creative, for example, I'm just not going to eat because I don't want
[17:49.540 --> 17:54.420]  ruin my creative flow. Or if I'm doing something that requires my full attention and I feel hungry,
[17:54.500 --> 17:59.840]  I can just kind of push that aside. And hangry used to be a constant emotion for me. Now it's,
[18:00.060 --> 18:02.360]  it takes like four or five days for me to get hangry.
[18:02.820 --> 18:05.280]  We could talk endlessly with you about survival.
[18:05.300 --> 18:06.400]  I would like to, yes.
[18:06.540 --> 18:11.640]  Yeah, we should circle back again some other time. I'd love to hit you with some regulation
[18:11.640 --> 18:12.580]  questions throughout.
[18:12.580 --> 18:13.200]  Yes, hit me.
[18:13.580 --> 18:17.440]  End of the thing. Were we the oddest ruling you gave as a judge?
[18:18.160 --> 18:25.200]  Ooh, that's certainly by far the most odd request that hired judge has ever received.
[18:25.480 --> 18:28.580]  No doubt about it. Yes.
[18:29.340 --> 18:34.820]  Let's say if someone was to go on an Australian news show and they've been doing something for
[18:34.820 --> 18:40.700]  like 17 years, do you think it's a lazy question to ask how they started when they've talked about
[18:40.700 --> 18:41.200]  it extensively?
[18:43.460 --> 18:44.100]  Yes.
[18:44.540 --> 18:46.200]  Thank you. Thank you very much.
[18:47.060 --> 18:50.420]  Is not knowing the shift key capitalized as hard to believe?
[18:51.860 --> 18:53.520]  That's impossible to believe.
[18:53.800 --> 18:55.540]  At what age?
[18:56.380 --> 18:57.580]  How old are you, Andrew?
[18:57.880 --> 18:58.480]  30?
[18:59.240 --> 19:01.700]  No fucking shot, dude. I don't believe that.
[19:01.800 --> 19:02.060]  29.
[19:02.480 --> 19:04.720]  I don't believe that for a second.
[19:05.500 --> 19:07.880]  Would extra medium be just medium or large?
[19:09.780 --> 19:10.820]  Extra medium?
[19:11.080 --> 19:11.380]  Yes.
[19:12.420 --> 19:13.380]  Just medium.
[19:13.700 --> 19:14.700]  Okay. Wow.
[19:15.040 --> 19:16.180]  Excellent answer. Thank you.
[19:16.180 --> 19:17.260]  Is eating in the bathtub weird?
[19:18.860 --> 19:22.300]  No. What a delight. What a delightful treat for yourself.
[19:23.560 --> 19:26.560]  I was going to ask, should I still have to eat the pencil? I feel like we've covered that.
[19:26.620 --> 19:27.780]  We know your stance on it.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.900]  Yes. Eat the pencil, damn it.
[19:30.640 --> 19:31.300]  Would you consider...
[19:31.300 --> 19:31.940]  You're a man of your word.
[19:32.360 --> 19:35.160]  Your 80-year-old self is so bummed that you're not a manager.
[19:40.220 --> 19:42.680]  Would you consider a pigeon an exotic bird?
[19:43.880 --> 19:48.440]  No, it feels very un-exotic. It feels like the antithesis of exotic.
[19:48.780 --> 19:50.500]  You're doing fantastic on these questions, by the way.
[19:50.520 --> 19:50.980]  You're nailing it. Yay.
[19:53.220 --> 19:56.720]  Are tail syncs necessary? So when we record, do you know what a tail sync is for recording?
[19:57.220 --> 19:57.540]  No.
[19:57.920 --> 20:01.180]  Okay, so we do a front sync where we count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
[20:01.200 --> 20:04.020]  and then at the end we do the same to make sure there's no audio drift.
[20:04.500 --> 20:07.260]  Do you think they're necessary? Are you okay with them?
[20:10.040 --> 20:11.820]  No. I fucking hate tail syncs.
[20:11.820 --> 20:12.920]  All right, well, that was a rough one.
[20:13.660 --> 20:14.520]  Nobody's perfect.
[20:14.780 --> 20:18.720]  Tail syncs are insane. Why would we ever... I have no idea, guys. Sure. Yes.
[20:19.160 --> 20:24.620]  And my last regulation question. Is this a condiment or a recipe to make a side?
[20:25.380 --> 20:28.320]  Sprinkle hot tater tots with a light dusting of chili powder,
[20:28.600 --> 20:32.540]  then combine pepper jack cheese with crisped up cubed pancetta,
[20:33.040 --> 20:37.940]  hard sauteed diced onions, and thinly sliced chives. Pour over the tots. Done.
[20:40.040 --> 20:43.360]  And that's supposed to be a condiment? That's a whole ass meal.
[20:43.700 --> 20:46.200]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[20:46.420 --> 20:49.140]  It fits the dictionary definition of the word condiment, but okay.
[20:51.140 --> 20:55.840]  Just because you put it on top of something, it's like, okay, yeah, take a pizza.
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.640]  A chutney is a condiment and it's full of stuff.
[20:58.640 --> 21:00.800]  It's a condiment. Fuck off. What are you talking about?
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.040]  Huh?
[21:04.420 --> 21:06.820]  That's fair. You're a hired judge, so...
[21:06.820 --> 21:11.480]  You're absolutely a hired judge. I think you should be the judge of all debates on our show.
[21:11.580 --> 21:13.640]  I think you should be the one that makes the definitive ruling.
[21:14.420 --> 21:17.820]  Shane, it's been so wonderful to talk with you. We need to do this again.
[21:18.260 --> 21:18.940]  This is amazing.
[21:19.440 --> 21:22.860]  It was also, let me just say, wonderful to watch you on Survivor.
[21:22.880 --> 21:26.260]  You were a fantastic contestant. You were exciting.
[21:26.480 --> 21:30.300]  It would have been the worst if we had this relationship with you
[21:31.060 --> 21:35.100]  tangentially and then you were a turd on TV, you know?
[21:35.100 --> 21:37.980]  And that was just not the case. You were delightful from day one.
[21:38.080 --> 21:39.700]  I mean, it was a lot of fun to watch you.
[21:40.020 --> 21:44.640]  Oh, man. That means so much to me. And honestly, the Regulation Podcast listeners have been
[21:44.640 --> 21:50.360]  out in full force in support. It felt really cool to see them popping up all over the place and
[21:50.360 --> 21:51.780]  talking shit to Kyle.
[21:55.020 --> 21:59.120]  It's been great. Kyle sending me screenshots of Regulation listeners,
[21:59.440 --> 22:02.060]  talking shit to him, is hysterical to me.
[22:02.060 --> 22:05.480]  And he's a good-natured dude about all that stuff.
[22:05.700 --> 22:05.740]  Great.
[22:06.260 --> 22:09.600]  I wanted to do something special for the Regulation listeners, too.
[22:09.860 --> 22:14.580]  So if you go to my website, ShaheenDivari.com, and you use the promo code PENCIL,
[22:14.980 --> 22:17.260]  you will get 20% off absolutely anything.
[22:17.820 --> 22:23.380]  I have a course that I am launching. It's coming out July 30th. It's a four-week course
[22:23.380 --> 22:26.460]  every Wednesday night because you don't have anything to do because Survivor's not on television,
[22:26.580 --> 22:31.540]  right? 5.30 PM to 7.30 PM. And basically, it's Pacific Standard Time.
[22:31.540 --> 22:34.700]  And it's a course that's just going to improve communication skills,
[22:35.280 --> 22:38.660]  everything from public speaking to interpersonal communication and
[22:38.660 --> 22:40.440]  your communication with yourself.
[22:40.860 --> 22:43.200]  Find your voice, heal your voice, use your voice.
[22:43.320 --> 22:49.040]  That's kind of my ethos behind how to become an expert communicator,
[22:49.140 --> 22:53.720]  how to become a super communicator. And that will make your life a lot easier.
[22:53.940 --> 22:56.480]  It doesn't matter what it is you're doing. If you have an interview coming up,
[22:56.500 --> 22:58.760]  if you have a wedding coming up, it doesn't matter what it is you're doing.
[22:58.760 --> 23:02.940]  If you can communicate better, your life just gets easier. And so promo code PENCIL,
[23:03.320 --> 23:10.180]  all caps, for the regulation pod and you get 20% off anything on my website, including the course.
[23:10.760 --> 23:14.160]  We will send everybody your way. Thank you so much for doing that. That's beyond kind of you.
[23:14.420 --> 23:18.200]  Yeah, of course. Are you kidding? The support has been pretty unreal,
[23:18.360 --> 23:23.420]  guys. I got to be honest. For like a 30-second clip that I had on your podcast years ago,
[23:23.640 --> 23:27.880]  the fact that that many people have come out of the woodwork was pretty hysterical.
[23:27.880 --> 23:32.140]  I just giggle every single time. And yeah, man, you really should eat the pencil.
[23:32.540 --> 23:38.460]  Well, you know, think about it. Maybe if you win the game, I'll eat the pencil.
[23:39.600 --> 23:46.520]  I have to get invited back first. We'll see. We'll see how that goes. I'd love to go out
[23:46.520 --> 23:50.000]  there and play that game. Would you go play, Andrew? Would you ever go play?
[23:51.220 --> 23:56.560]  I don't know. It was something I considered, but they didn't allow Canadians to play for
[23:56.560 --> 24:01.360]  such a long time. So it was sort of something I was at peace with as far as deciding. I don't
[24:01.360 --> 24:04.840]  know. I'd have to really think about it. You should apply. It'd be fun to watch you out
[24:04.840 --> 24:07.880]  there. I think the regulation listeners would go absolutely insane.
[24:08.380 --> 24:10.560]  I completely agree. I support this. I think you should do it, Andrew.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.900]  I would tell Jeff to make sure that one of the rewards was a pencil.
[24:16.840 --> 24:20.020]  Oh, are we doing blind auction? Are we doing the auction lifting the thing?
[24:20.120 --> 24:25.740]  Oh my God. Could you imagine the television of them bringing out one singular pencil?
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.180]  Under a fucking thing. Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[24:29.280 --> 24:32.560]  Yeah. Well, this has been so wonderful to speak with you. We got to sync up again.
[24:32.720 --> 24:35.120]  This is amazing. Thank you so much for your time, Sheen.
[24:35.160 --> 24:36.620]  A pleasure. Thank you so much.
[24:37.060 --> 24:37.440]  Absolutely.
[24:37.660 --> 24:39.100]  Thank you so much to everybody.
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.360]  Of course, I love the name change, but I also really enjoyed the previous name of the podcast.
[24:45.740 --> 24:49.200]  It would have been hilarious if that was in the comments every five seconds.
[24:49.200 --> 24:50.720]  And the name change.
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.560]  That podcast was a lot easier to do under the umbrella of a much larger corporation.
[24:57.520 --> 24:59.020]  We no longer have the cover.
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.800]  Makes sense. Yeah, I get it. I get it.
[25:01.880 --> 25:04.440]  All right, friends. Thank you so much for the interview. Thank you so much for the time and
[25:04.440 --> 25:06.080]  for organizing all this, man. This has been awesome.
[25:06.380 --> 25:06.560]  Absolutely, man.
[25:06.620 --> 25:07.780]  So good. Talk to you later.
[25:08.260 --> 25:08.540]  Bye, man.
[25:08.980 --> 25:09.340]  Bye.
