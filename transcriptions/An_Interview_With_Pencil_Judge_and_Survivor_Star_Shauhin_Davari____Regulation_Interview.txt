[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[00:04.800 --> 00:09.580]  blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown
[00:09.580 --> 00:14.760]  sugar cold foam. Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.160 --> 00:21.520]  Hello and welcome to a special regulation supplemental for the first time in our
[00:21.520 --> 00:25.920]  show's history. This is big. We have a guest. We've never done this. We've been very
[00:25.920 --> 00:32.080]  anti-guest in our history. Let me just jump in real quick and say that you need to eat the
[00:32.080 --> 00:40.020]  damn pencil, man. No. You understand? No. Right now. Never. Never. I'm sending you fried pencil.
[00:40.200 --> 00:45.420]  I'll even fry it up with chicken for you and send it to you. But do you have any idea how many of
[00:45.420 --> 00:51.080]  your listeners are popping into my comments? They literally have gone onto my mother's Instagram
[00:51.080 --> 00:59.280]  page. No. Can you tell Shaheen to tell Andrew to eat the pencil? No. And I don't know how these,
[00:59.500 --> 01:04.820]  first of all, thank you regulation podcast listeners. I am thrilled every time I see
[01:04.820 --> 01:10.140]  a comment that tells me to tell you to eat the pencil. And listen, man, it's okay. You
[01:10.140 --> 01:18.240]  cannot eat the pencil. You just have to say, I am not a man of my word. You should never make a bet
[01:18.240 --> 01:24.880]  with Andrew. As long as you say those things and then we can record it and then we can play it at
[01:24.880 --> 01:33.400]  your funeral. Uh-huh. No one can, you know, be confused. First of all, I'd like to counter with
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.220]  I'm an honorable man. Second of all, all of these comments, kind of your fault. If you would have
[01:38.220 --> 01:42.300]  gave the other ruling, nobody would be submitting it. So that's kind of on you. That's not how this
[01:42.300 --> 01:47.380]  works, Andrew. I think that what needs to happen is you need to eat the pencil, not for us, but to
[01:47.380 --> 01:53.260]  alleviate the pressure on Shaheen and his family. Seriously, that you have unduly put upon them.
[01:53.320 --> 01:56.880]  I, you know, I, I, once again, I blame the ruling less so my lack of action.
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.720]  Yeah. Um, I want everyone to know, I know this is not a video podcast, but I did bring a pencil.
[02:05.380 --> 02:11.600]  I'm holding it the entire time. Um, interestingly, uh, it's, it is a pen. The, it doesn't have an
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.060]  eraser. So I even removed the eraser. Wow. I know. I'd be more concerned about the metal
[02:17.060 --> 02:22.380]  part than the eraser, but I appreciate the eraser removal. Yeah, no problem. Any, any,
[02:22.460 --> 02:29.820]  anything I can do for you. I also, um, I am thrilled that you now know how seasons work.
[02:29.920 --> 02:38.620]  I am just that for you. I did that for you. Thank you. That was important to you. I wanted
[02:38.620 --> 02:43.360]  to make sure my real name is Shaheen. It's not, it's not, it's not a stage name. That's my real
[02:43.360 --> 02:48.280]  name. Oh, that's great. It means royal white Falcon. I know you're protected by Falcons.
[02:48.420 --> 02:53.360]  That's incredible. That was another layer of just absurdity around all of this.
[02:53.640 --> 03:01.460]  Yeah. The, the similarities, uh, are striking. Okay. Oh, I'm I'm which similarities? Well,
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.760]  we are a podcast that is protected by Falcons and Falcon is your name. I don't know if you
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.980]  know this, but we discovered, we went to a, we went to a hotel in Mexico for a vacation two years
[03:10.980 --> 03:16.020]  ago. And we kept seeing this guy walk around with a hooded Falcon, uh, around the pool and
[03:16.020 --> 03:20.000]  stuff. So we went up, finally, we got up the courage to talk to him and he said, yeah, the hotel
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.860]  is protected by this Falcon. It keeps the birds away. Then we found out there's an entire industry
[03:24.860 --> 03:32.780]  where large hotels have full-time Falcon staffs to keep birds and, uh, pests away on the beach.
[03:32.780 --> 03:37.080]  And it really opened our world. So now we've, we've decided that the Falcon would be the
[03:37.640 --> 03:40.720]  appropriate protector of our podcast. And then here we are talking to.
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.680]  The Royal White Falcon. The Royal White Falcon. Yeah, exactly right. And just like for the
[03:45.680 --> 03:49.920]  absurdity, for your context, like Survivor, probably the most important show in my life.
[03:49.940 --> 03:55.380]  Like I started watching, uh, first season when I was like five or six. It is something that I would
[03:55.380 --> 04:01.260]  watch every week with my mom. It was like one of the most important shows for me. So the fact that
[04:01.260 --> 04:09.100]  the you of all people end up on Survivor and also have this strange connection where as much as
[04:09.100 --> 04:13.740]  you're talking about being hounded about eat the pencil, I get it constantly on all forms.
[04:13.860 --> 04:19.260]  It's something I live with. So to learn that you were going to be on the show was so just absurd,
[04:19.400 --> 04:24.580]  like the world doesn't make sense. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I share that with you too, man. I watched
[04:24.580 --> 04:30.120]  Survivor with my mom. It was during the pandemic and no, we had, we had just, uh, like middle of
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.920]  pandemic lost my father. And it was like, my mom had also just had a back surgery.
[04:35.640 --> 04:41.980]  And so she couldn't go anywhere. And her mind was just consumed with this garbage and she couldn't
[04:41.980 --> 04:46.460]  get through anything. And so it was like, mom, watch Survivor, like just down and watch Survivor.
[04:46.580 --> 04:51.180]  It's so fun. And it's such a good show for you because you know, my mom was a hairstylist for
[04:51.180 --> 04:58.620]  forever, which is just a game of backstabbing people. And my mom would, my mom would get to
[04:58.620 --> 05:05.960]  the hair salon. And like when people's clients would come in, she would, she would be the one
[05:05.960 --> 05:09.820]  scheduling them, right? She'd be the first chair. And so she would pick up the phone when the
[05:09.820 --> 05:14.760]  receptionist wasn't there. And she would schedule the clients for time when they're, when they
[05:14.760 --> 05:19.900]  weren't there. And so they would show up and my mom would be like, Oh, they're not here. I can,
[05:20.020 --> 05:22.580]  you know, they do this all the time. Why don't you just go ahead and sit in my chair?
[05:26.380 --> 05:30.120]  And so that's, that's like where, you know, my, that's, I was like, okay, mom,
[05:30.140 --> 05:33.140]  you got to watch this show. Cause this is, this is just that on television.
[05:33.700 --> 05:37.260]  Right up your alley. Yeah. And it's awesome.
[05:37.620 --> 05:42.480]  Yeah. I have a question regarding like someone who's watched the show. Was there a moment or
[05:42.480 --> 05:46.920]  experience that you anticipated as a viewer? Cause Survivor has like all these things that you kind
[05:46.920 --> 05:51.700]  of expect to hit on if you're going to be on the show that's still surprised you by how it felt as
[05:51.700 --> 05:57.820]  a player. Like you saw it coming. Yes. Yes. When you're sitting there,
[05:58.060 --> 06:05.720]  it feels very different when Jeff says, and one of you is not going to make the jury. Okay. Because
[06:05.720 --> 06:10.140]  like when, when you're at that, there's so in Survivor, there's a challenge where, you know,
[06:10.220 --> 06:16.440]  you're split into two tribes and the team that loses the tribe that loses the challenge goes
[06:16.440 --> 06:21.400]  to tribal. And that's the last person who's not going to make the jury, even though they've made
[06:21.400 --> 06:28.440]  the merge, which is like one step in the game. Stuff like that hits a lot harder when you're
[06:28.440 --> 06:31.680]  out there versus when you're sitting on your couch, like, Oh, someone doesn't make the jury.
[06:31.780 --> 06:36.060]  Like who cares? But when it's you and you're looking down the line and you're looking at
[06:36.060 --> 06:40.260]  David with his gleaming muscles and you have to hold onto a thing and you're like, all right,
[06:40.300 --> 06:44.540]  well, I'm not winning the challenge. I hope that he wins the overall thing. It's like
[06:45.160 --> 06:49.960]  that type of stuff when he says, Oh, you're going to have fried chicken and waffles. And you haven't
[06:49.960 --> 06:56.080]  eaten in 16 days. You're like, you know, I had, I had a croissant up into that point. I had one
[06:56.080 --> 07:00.960]  chocolate croissant and half a vegan donut, which by the way, when they told me it was a vegan donut,
[07:01.300 --> 07:08.100]  I nearly was like, get Jeff to the island right now. Give me a real damn donut.
[07:09.620 --> 07:13.460]  But yeah, it was like, you know, that type of stuff when they're talking about like,
[07:13.460 --> 07:20.400]  you're going to have this food, dude, you haven't eaten in 12 days, and you just want something to
[07:20.400 --> 07:24.280]  eat. And so the excitement that you see, even though you know, these things are coming is
[07:24.280 --> 07:29.400]  very real. And it's visceral for someone who's out there in a way that it just can't be for
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.680]  someone who's sitting on the couch. Yeah, that's such a the jury line is so interesting.
[07:33.840 --> 07:38.980]  As a viewer, like I understand like, Oh, man, that sucks. I guess like you're going home,
[07:39.020 --> 07:42.440]  but it doesn't the significance of because it's when you're watching it, it's all about
[07:42.440 --> 07:48.440]  winning, largely. So the idea that there's a stakes difference between how you lose is not
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.100]  present when you're not like feeling it and going through those emotions and trying your best to
[07:53.100 --> 07:57.360]  advance. When you think about it, you're if you're on the jury, you're on every episode,
[07:57.400 --> 08:01.900]  first of all, that is not something that I thought about until I was out there.
[08:02.400 --> 08:07.020]  Wait, if you're on the jury, you're going to be on every episode. But more importantly than that,
[08:07.540 --> 08:13.060]  you get like when he says you get to have a say in who wins the million dollars and who has the
[08:13.060 --> 08:17.680]  title of sole survivor. That doesn't mean anything to the audience. Yeah, but it does
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.200]  mean something to you when you're out there. You're one of eight people that gets to vote on
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.620]  who gets a Millie. You're one of eight people that gets to vote who gets to win your season
[08:26.620 --> 08:30.980]  because it's your season, right? Yeah. And that goes into the voting, I think more than the
[08:30.980 --> 08:35.820]  viewers would think to like, a lot of what I was voting for was who I wanted to make sure
[08:35.820 --> 08:41.000]  won this season. Because I didn't, I wanted to make sure that we were represented by the right
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.460]  season winner. Sure. You know, like that, that that matters a lot. Yeah.
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.640]  Oh, that makes total sense. That's so interesting. I'm curious, on the other end of it now having
[08:50.640 --> 08:55.500]  played the game, has that changed your perception of previous seasons you've watched?
[08:56.060 --> 09:02.980]  Have you? Oh, that's an interesting question. I extend a lot more respect for anyone who has
[09:02.980 --> 09:08.420]  played the game. And, you know, a lot of people are like, Oh, oh, gosh, yes.
[09:09.460 --> 09:14.760]  What drives me nuts now that didn't before and I was probably guilty of it before
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.160]  was people saying, Why would they do that?
[09:21.020 --> 09:27.400]  Why would they do that? How about answer the question? That's what drives me nuts.
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.160]  If you want to watch the show or any reality television show, stop assuming these people
[09:33.160 --> 09:40.340]  are stupid, and start answering your question. Why would he do this? Oh, let me answer the
[09:40.340 --> 09:45.840]  question. And I'll be a much better watcher of the television show. Because by providing an answer
[09:45.840 --> 09:52.280]  that assumes the person isn't a moron, you're going to get better at your own mental strategy.
[09:52.380 --> 09:56.940]  What are the reasons this person could do this? People got mad at Bianca for telling Cedric that
[09:56.940 --> 10:01.200]  she lost her vote. Okay, well, what would you have done in a situation he voted out the person
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.560]  who lied to him the first time and the whole entire time he's talking about that for me?
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.840]  Why did you search Kyle's bag? Well, I wanted to show Camilla that I trusted her, because we were
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.100]  going to work together throughout the rest of the game. You don't see the three hour conversation
[10:15.100 --> 10:20.860]  that Camilla and I had, right? You can't, you just can't. And so a lot of these, what changed for me
[10:20.860 --> 10:26.980]  was I extend a lot more respect towards the people who have played games like this. Knowing
[10:26.980 --> 10:32.300]  that a lot of stuff is just it just has to be left on the editing floor. We're talking about
[10:32.300 --> 10:38.460]  1700 hours plus a footage, something like that, and only 13 hours get shown. That's and like,
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.760]  you know, another hour of that is just them showing cool animals and shit. A lot of snakes.
[10:44.080 --> 10:48.840]  And on my season, like 15 minutes of that was them just showing, you know, David and Joe's
[10:48.840 --> 10:54.120]  pets. Yeah, absolutely. Speaking of leaving stuff on the editing floor, how do you leave the
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.660]  emotions and the feelings on the island when you come back? Because now you're in this exclusive
[10:59.660 --> 11:04.200]  club, which you'll be in for the rest of your life. You know, the Survivor Club of I think
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.900]  there's less than 800 people that have played it across the entirety of it. And I assume that
[11:08.900 --> 11:14.660]  Survivor becomes a part of your life going forward. And you're going to interact and deal with like
[11:14.660 --> 11:20.520]  Kyle, for example, who framed you very famously. How do you put that aside or leave that on the
[11:20.520 --> 11:23.680]  island and main and like have a friendly relationship going forward? Or is that even
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.620]  possible? You don't leave it on the island, you have to work through the emotion. Yeah,
[11:28.660 --> 11:32.920]  you can't just like cut it off. And then Oh, I'm fine. No, no, no, you got you got to work
[11:32.920 --> 11:37.560]  through that you have to have the difficult conversation, you have to navigate that stuff.
[11:37.660 --> 11:43.540]  And, and you have to, you know, work through your emotions and in a lot of different ways for me
[11:43.540 --> 11:47.300]  personally. And I think this is a personal journey for everyone. There are people and there
[11:47.300 --> 11:51.940]  are moments that are like unforgivable, right? Yeah, there are things and that's part of the
[11:51.940 --> 11:55.160]  thing that you sign up for when you go out there. It's like, okay, that's just unforgivable. I'm
[11:55.160 --> 11:58.480]  never going to be friends with that person or talk to that person or be around that person.
[11:58.580 --> 12:02.920]  And that's the way it goes. And actually, my recommendation to people who are going to go out
[12:02.920 --> 12:08.580]  there is really continually remind yourself, you're never going to talk to these people again.
[12:08.580 --> 12:13.720]  Yeah, try and play that way. And, and, and that doesn't mean don't get close to them.
[12:13.780 --> 12:16.900]  That means get close to them with the idea that you're never going to talk to these people again,
[12:17.080 --> 12:20.280]  in the back of your mind always. And that's kind of what I did every, every morning,
[12:20.340 --> 12:24.880]  if you go back and watch the show, every morning, you will see me like opening my palms and closing
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.220]  my eyes. And I'm accepting my vibes from home. I told people from send me good vibes, right? And I
[12:30.220 --> 12:38.560]  was accepting those vibes at sunrise every single morning. And what that really was, for me was a
[12:38.560 --> 12:44.720]  who was important to me, while I was out there, those people back home are important to me. Now,
[12:46.320 --> 12:54.340]  how do I compartmentalize? I journaled my ass off when I got back, right? And while I was out there,
[12:54.360 --> 12:58.720]  when I got voted out of the game, I journaled a ton. I meditate every single day, I do breath
[12:58.720 --> 13:05.360]  work every single day. That stuff allows emotional processing, journaling, meditation, breath work,
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.980]  that stuff allows for emotional processing in a really profound way, because you're just taking
[13:09.980 --> 13:15.420]  that weight off of your head, right? You're just moving away every time you do some meditation or
[13:15.420 --> 13:20.180]  some breath work or journaling or whatever, you're removing that mental weight, because
[13:20.180 --> 13:23.820]  you're downloading it into your journal, or you're getting rid of it through your body.
[13:24.160 --> 13:28.480]  And then you have to have difficult conversations, you have to navigate really difficult
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.020]  conversations. Joe and I had a very difficult, very long conversation where we talked about
[13:34.020 --> 13:41.400]  why he decided to believe Kyle over me, why we had that bad day, and why we didn't work it out,
[13:41.600 --> 13:51.020]  and why he did the vote that he did. And on the other side of that is strength in connection,
[13:51.500 --> 13:56.780]  that through that, you can have a stronger connection. And I think Joe and I have a really
[13:56.780 --> 14:01.120]  strong connection. And Kyle and I do too. I, you know, I'm super proud of the game that he played,
[14:01.120 --> 14:07.140]  he played an amazing game. Yeah, yeah. And I'm a different dude when it comes to stuff like that,
[14:07.180 --> 14:12.860]  too. Like I understood what I was going out there to do. I think it's harder if you are
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.160]  maybe not as emotionally prepared, maybe don't have as many tools like that, that stuff tends
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.260]  to be harder. But I knew I was going out there to play a game, I knew the chances were
[14:22.260 --> 14:26.860]  that I was going to get fucked over. And sure, I was gonna have to deal with that.
[14:28.260 --> 14:31.900]  And meanwhile, they put 18 of the coolest motherfuckers on planet Earth
[14:31.900 --> 14:37.140]  on a television show with me. And so it's like, okay, cool. I did lose. And now I'm also going
[14:37.140 --> 14:41.460]  to sacrifice being friends with someone like Joe Hunter. Like, Joe is one of the coolest,
[14:41.780 --> 14:46.240]  sweetest, kindest, best dudes on planet Earth. And you're going to lose the show and lose a
[14:46.240 --> 14:50.860]  friendship. Like that doesn't make any sense to me personally. I would imagine to the connections
[14:50.860 --> 14:55.380]  that you're making there are so intense and so real. I liken it to like going through basic
[14:55.380 --> 14:59.140]  training in the military, which I did when I was very young, you develop these intense
[14:59.140 --> 15:03.660]  bonds with people because you're together 24 hours a day, which is like, I don't like, like,
[15:04.440 --> 15:06.500]  like three years of a relationship.
[15:06.820 --> 15:13.120]  Oh, yeah, I would I would say it's more like each day is probably around half a year.
[15:13.180 --> 15:13.860]  Okay. Yeah.
[15:14.180 --> 15:16.260]  Friendship in the in like the regular world. So
[15:16.820 --> 15:17.880]  at the same time,
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.860]  around 12 years is how long I feel like I've known Joe Hunter.
[15:21.080 --> 15:25.200]  At the same time as you're getting closer and probably falling in love with these
[15:25.200 --> 15:27.940]  people to some degree and developing like potentially lifelong friendships,
[15:28.100 --> 15:32.040]  you're also working against each other knowing they're working against you. And
[15:32.040 --> 15:35.460]  that's just an environment that a person doesn't find themselves in
[15:35.460 --> 15:38.660]  throughout the course of their life. Typically, I think it must.
[15:39.180 --> 15:41.000]  Yeah, it's got to do a number on you emotionally.
[15:41.420 --> 15:45.000]  Yeah, yeah, for sure. You there's I mean, there's a you're provided a therapist from
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.480]  from CBS after the show, because there's a again, like there's a lot of processing that
[15:49.480 --> 15:53.340]  you have to do in order to understand like, okay, it's a game. I mean, when I came back,
[15:53.340 --> 15:58.680]  I was lingering around conversations the same way I would linger on conversations around camp.
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.000]  So instead of being like, All right, guys, bye. I'd be like, All right, guys, bye.
[16:02.220 --> 16:05.940]  And then I would like duck around the corner and, you know, put my ear.
[16:08.260 --> 16:12.440]  How long do you feel like normal old regular sheen again after coming back?
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.660]  So I imagine your relationship with food is different for a while to
[16:14.660 --> 16:21.540]  Oh, no, no, there's no there's no. There's no feeling normal. Again.
[16:22.000 --> 16:22.400]  Interesting.
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.960]  It's in your brain now, right? It's, you know, you don't, someone said it to me the other day,
[16:27.980 --> 16:33.720]  and I can't remember who it was. I wish I could. It was so good. But you're, you're going on
[16:33.720 --> 16:38.380]  survivor, your life is going to change. So if you like, if you like everything about your life,
[16:38.580 --> 16:42.260]  if you don't want your life to change, don't go on survivor, it's life changing.
[16:42.580 --> 16:46.320]  So there is the before time and there is the after time. Like, for example,
[16:46.660 --> 16:51.360]  I used to go by shop with a lot of my friends, like people that knew me even
[16:51.360 --> 16:57.800]  when I was a college, like at the college. And I, when I came back after 30, you know,
[16:57.900 --> 17:02.920]  30 something days total, the only thing that I ever told production, my name was was Shaheen.
[17:03.160 --> 17:07.620]  I never told them that I went by shop, because I didn't want to be called Shah there wanted to be
[17:07.620 --> 17:12.300]  called Shaheen. It mattered to me culturally was important to me called Shaheen out there.
[17:13.380 --> 17:18.460]  And when I came back, and my friends, you know, that had been calling me that for a long time
[17:18.460 --> 17:22.200]  called me that again, I was like, it was like nails on a chalkboard all of a sudden, Oh, whoa,
[17:22.320 --> 17:30.260]  don't I can't be that guy anymore. That guy is gone for sure. And, you know, Shaheen has risen
[17:30.260 --> 17:34.760]  from the ashes, if you will, like, so yeah, your life is going to change. My relationship with food
[17:34.760 --> 17:40.460]  is different. There's many times now where it's like, I'm hungry. And I just don't need to eat.
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.140]  Yeah, I'm hungry. I don't need to eat. And so if I'm in the middle of something creative,
[17:46.140 --> 17:51.380]  for example, I'm just not going to eat because I don't want to ruin my creative flow. Or if I'm
[17:51.380 --> 17:55.460]  doing something that requires my full attention, and I feel hungry, I can just kind of push that
[17:55.460 --> 18:01.380]  aside. And hangry used to be a constant emotion for me. Now it's, it takes like four or five
[18:01.380 --> 18:06.360]  days for me to get hangry. We could talk endlessly with you about survival. I would like to Yes,
[18:06.540 --> 18:12.220]  yeah, we should circle back again some other time. I'd love to hit you some regulation questions
[18:12.220 --> 18:17.460]  Yes, hit me. Yeah, the thing. Were we the oddest ruling you gave as a judge?
[18:18.280 --> 18:26.460]  Ooh, did certainly by far the most odd request that hired judge has ever received. No doubt.
[18:28.740 --> 18:34.280]  Yes. Let's say if someone was to go on an Australian news show, and they've been doing
[18:34.280 --> 18:39.920]  something for like 17 years. Do you think it's a lazy question to ask how they started when
[18:39.920 --> 18:46.880]  they've talked about it extensively? Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes.
[18:47.260 --> 18:50.400]  It's not knowing the shift key capitalizes hard to believe.
[18:51.860 --> 18:55.540]  That's impossible to believe. Okay. At what age?
[18:56.340 --> 19:01.720]  How old are you Andrew? 30? Let's say no fucking shot. I don't believe that.
[19:03.240 --> 19:07.880]  For a second. Would extra medium be just medium or large?
[19:09.940 --> 19:16.640]  Extra medium? Yes. Just medium. Okay. Wow. Excellent answer. Thank you. Is eating in
[19:16.640 --> 19:22.300]  the bathtub weird? No, what a delight. What a delightful treat for yourself.
[19:23.540 --> 19:26.780]  I was gonna ask should I still have to eat the pencil? I feel like we've covered that we know
[19:26.780 --> 19:34.380]  your stance on it. Yeah, eat the pencil damn it. Would you consider yourself is so bummed that
[19:34.380 --> 19:45.400]  you're not a manager? Would you consider a pigeon an exotic bird? No, it feels very
[19:45.400 --> 19:50.180]  unexcited. It feels like the antithesis of exotic. You're doing fantastic on these questions.
[19:53.120 --> 19:56.740]  Are tail syncs necessary? So when we record, you know what a tail sync is for recording?
[19:57.180 --> 20:01.800]  No. Okay. So we do a front sync where we count five, four, three, two, one. And then at the end,
[20:01.800 --> 20:06.140]  we do the same to make sure there's no audio drift. Do you think they're necessary? Do you
[20:06.140 --> 20:16.500]  think? Are you okay with them? No, I fucking had nobody's perfect. They're insane. Why would we
[20:16.500 --> 20:23.320]  ever? I have no idea, guys. Sure. Yes. And my last regulation question, is this a condiment
[20:23.320 --> 20:28.320]  or a recipe to make a side sprinkle hot tater tots with a light dusting of chili powder,
[20:28.320 --> 20:32.560]  then combine pepper jack cheese with crisped up cube pancetta,
[20:32.920 --> 20:37.940]  hard sauteed diced onions, and thinly sliced chives. Pour over the tots. Done.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.700]  And that's supposed to be a condiment. That's a whole ass meal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[20:45.700 --> 20:49.140]  you so much. It fits the dictionary definition of the word condiment, but okay.
[20:51.140 --> 20:55.840]  Just because you put it on top of something, it's like, okay, yeah, take a pizza.
[20:58.320 --> 21:00.820]  It's a condiment. Fuck off. What are you talking about?
[21:05.140 --> 21:08.960]  You're a higher judge, so. You're absolutely a higher judge. I think you should be
[21:08.960 --> 21:13.620]  the judge of all debates on our show. I think you should be the one that makes the definitive ruling.
[21:14.600 --> 21:18.940]  Shane, it's been so wonderful to talk with you. We need to do this again. This is amazing.
[21:19.400 --> 21:25.000]  It was also, let me just say, wonderful to watch you on Survivor. You were a fantastic contestant.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.160]  You were exciting. It would have been the worst if we had this relationship with you
[21:31.100 --> 21:34.840]  tangentially, and then you were a turd on TV. Yeah, absolutely.
[21:35.400 --> 21:39.940]  And that was just not the case. You were delightful from day one. It was a lot of fun to watch you.
[21:40.040 --> 21:44.660]  Oh, man, that means so much to me. And honestly, the Regulation Podcast listeners have been
[21:44.660 --> 21:50.340]  out in full force in support. It felt really cool to see them popping up all over the place and
[21:50.340 --> 22:00.940]  talking shit to Kyle. Kyle sending me screenshots of Regulation listeners talking shit to him is
[22:00.940 --> 22:07.420]  hysterical to me. And he's a good-natured dude about all that stuff. But I wanted to do something
[22:07.420 --> 22:12.880]  special for the Regulation listeners too. So if you go to my website, shahindivari.com,
[22:12.920 --> 22:20.040]  and you use the promo code pencil, you will get 20% off absolutely anything. I have a course that I
[22:20.040 --> 22:24.340]  launching. It's coming out July 30. It's a four-week course every Wednesday night because
[22:24.340 --> 22:29.300]  you don't have anything to do because Survivor is not on television, right? 5.30pm to 7.30pm.
[22:29.560 --> 22:33.560]  And basically, it's Pacific Standard Time. And it's a course that's just going to improve
[22:33.560 --> 22:38.660]  communication skills, everything from public speaking to interpersonal communication and
[22:38.660 --> 22:44.020]  your communication with yourself. Find your voice, heal your voice, use your voice. That's my
[22:44.940 --> 22:52.440]  ethos behind how to become an expert communicator, how to become a super communicator. And that will
[22:52.440 --> 22:55.940]  make your life a lot easier. It doesn't matter what it is you're doing. If you have an interview
[22:55.940 --> 22:58.760]  coming up, if you have a wedding coming up, it doesn't matter what it is you're doing,
[22:58.820 --> 23:04.000]  if you can communicate better, your life just gets easier. And so promo code pencil, all caps
[23:05.680 --> 23:10.200]  for the Regulation pod and you get 20% off anything on my website, including the course.
[23:10.740 --> 23:13.360]  We will send everybody your way. Thank you so much for doing that. That's
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.220]  beyond kind of you. Yeah, of course. You're kidding. The support has been pretty unreal,
[23:18.360 --> 23:23.420]  guys. I got to be honest, for like a 30-second clip that I had on your podcast years ago,
[23:23.660 --> 23:28.820]  the fact that that many people have come out of the woodwork was pretty hysterical. I just giggle
[23:28.820 --> 23:33.740]  every single time. And yeah, man, you really should eat the pencil. Well, you know, think
[23:33.740 --> 23:42.920]  about it. Maybe if you win the game, I'll eat the pencil. Wow. I have to get invited back first.
[23:42.920 --> 23:47.320]  We'll see how that goes. I'd love to go out there and play that game.
[23:47.920 --> 23:50.000]  Would you go play, Andrew? Would you ever go play?
[23:51.360 --> 23:56.560]  I don't know. It was something I considered, but they didn't allow Canadians to play for
[23:56.560 --> 24:01.360]  such a long time. So it was sort of something I was at peace with as far as deciding. I don't
[24:01.360 --> 24:04.840]  know. I'd have to really think about it. You should apply. It'd be fun to watch you out
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.520]  there. I think the Regulation listeners would go absolutely insane. I completely agree. I support
[24:09.520 --> 24:14.240]  this. I think you should do it, Andrew. I would tell Jeff to make sure that one of the rewards
[24:14.240 --> 24:20.020]  was a pencil. Oh, we're doing blind auction? We're doing the auction lifting the thing?
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.780]  Oh my God, could you imagine the television of them bringing out one singular pencil
[24:26.340 --> 24:30.100]  under a fucking thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know what it is. Yeah. Well,
[24:30.140 --> 24:33.720]  this has been so wonderful to speak with you. We got to sync up again. This is amazing. Thank you
[24:33.720 --> 24:38.860]  so much for your time, Sheen. A pleasure. Thank you guys so much. Absolutely. Thank you so much
[24:38.860 --> 24:44.320]  Of course, I love the name change, but I also really enjoyed the previous name of the podcast.
[24:45.940 --> 24:49.160]  It would have been hilarious if that was in the comments every five seconds.
[24:52.140 --> 24:56.540]  That podcast was a lot easier to do under the umbrella of a much larger corporation.
[24:57.060 --> 25:02.100]  Yeah. We no longer have the cover. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I get it. All right,
[25:02.120 --> 25:04.960]  friends. Thank you so much for the interview. Thank you so much for the time and for organizing
[25:04.960 --> 25:08.440]  all this, man. This has been awesome. Absolutely, man. So good. Talk to you in a great day. Bye,
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.380]  man. Take it easy. Bye.
