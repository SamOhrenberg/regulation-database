[00:38.920 --> 00:48.440]  Hello and welcome to Are We Nostradamus? Our official regulation 2025 predictions draft.
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.360]  We are going to sit down and over the next 30 minutes to however long we argue with each other,
[00:53.360 --> 00:59.360]  we're going to make four predictions each draft style, snake draft style,
[00:59.360 --> 01:05.060]  about things that are going to happen in the year 2025. Then we'll live that year out
[01:05.060 --> 01:11.240]  normal style like everybody does, living in the moment as they say. In 2026, which is about a year
[01:11.240 --> 01:15.460]  from now, we're going to reconvene. We're going to go over these and we're going to determine
[01:15.460 --> 01:20.540]  were we Nostradamus? I'm going to guess yes. You'll have to wait a year to find out.
[01:20.800 --> 01:24.700]  Is everybody ready? Or who is the most Nostradamus of all of us?
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.940]  Who's the most Nostradamus? That's a good point too.
[01:27.280 --> 01:34.200]  We could all potentially be Nostradamus. It's just about who is the most Nostradamus of us.
[01:34.360 --> 01:36.800]  The most Nostradamus. Who's the most Nostradamus of us. Yeah.
[01:37.120 --> 01:40.340]  The most Nostradamus. Oh, interesting. Who's our Nostradamus?
[01:40.800 --> 01:43.600]  Now I would like to say from the upfront, just really quickly,
[01:43.600 --> 01:49.600]  I have no insider knowledge on any of my picks. This is all from the heart. This is all me
[01:50.460 --> 01:58.200]  statistical data. I am just tapping into percentages and or just the realities of the world.
[01:58.260 --> 02:02.280]  I hate this. I don't like, I don't like the way he teed all that up.
[02:02.820 --> 02:08.460]  We are doing this on our regular draft board just to be able to keep track of it,
[02:08.820 --> 02:12.220]  which means we have the opportunity to randomize names.
[02:12.220 --> 02:15.020]  What? I was just going randomize.
[02:15.340 --> 02:19.280]  Some background support vocals on that. It's nice.
[02:19.620 --> 02:22.980]  It helps. It makes the production feel layered. Appreciate it.
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.020]  So how many times do we want to randomize or do we want to maintain an anag order?
[02:30.500 --> 02:32.100]  25. Okay.
[02:32.460 --> 02:34.380]  I was thinking 11. Why is it 25?
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.820]  Because it's 2025. Did you guys all think that?
[02:38.040 --> 02:38.720]  No. Yes.
[02:38.720 --> 02:40.160]  Well, me and Nick did, apparently.
[02:40.420 --> 02:46.300]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Andrew, Eric, Gavin, Jeff, Nick.
[02:46.300 --> 02:49.780]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[02:49.800 --> 02:51.120]  Oh, 16. That's right. I forgot about that.
[02:51.700 --> 02:55.560]  Here's 21. Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric, Jeff.
[02:55.560 --> 02:56.720]  Love it. I like it.
[02:56.840 --> 02:57.960]  Give me the first one. Give me the first one.
[02:58.060 --> 03:01.720]  I really don't want to be in a swing. All I want is to not be a swing.
[03:02.240 --> 03:03.200]  Don't make me last.
[03:03.460 --> 03:07.620]  24. 24 is Gavin, Andrew, Jeff, Eric, Nick.
[03:07.880 --> 03:07.960]  Put me in the middle.
[03:08.680 --> 03:09.640]  Jeff, you think you'll be in the middle?
[03:10.660 --> 03:13.640]  I'm in the middle right now. Gagging order. We'll see. I don't think so.
[03:13.780 --> 03:15.080]  Okay. And here we go.
[03:15.080 --> 03:19.340]  Jeff, Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Jeff, Eric.
[03:19.600 --> 03:22.640]  That is the official order for Are We Nostradamus?
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.660]  And now it's time for our picks.
[03:25.960 --> 03:29.980]  Gavin, you have the very first prediction for the year 2025.
[03:30.660 --> 03:33.620]  Well, I want to be the Nostradamus, obviously.
[03:34.100 --> 03:39.700]  So what on my list is the most absolute certainty of anything that could happen?
[03:39.900 --> 03:42.780]  And I've got to go with Andrew breaks a chair.
[03:42.780 --> 03:45.720]  Oh, I don't like that one.
[03:46.280 --> 03:48.040]  I don't like that one.
[03:48.180 --> 03:50.820]  And we know it's like a September incident, isn't it?
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.120]  Isn't that when it takes place?
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.880]  Second or third week of September.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.600]  Yeah, that's really good.
[03:56.680 --> 03:58.000]  That's a problem for me.
[03:58.400 --> 03:59.560]  There goes my first pick.
[04:00.660 --> 04:02.320]  Dang. Wow.
[04:02.420 --> 04:03.960]  I don't like that. Oh, I don't like this at all.
[04:04.100 --> 04:07.420]  You know what? Once again, I'm only feeling better about my picks.
[04:08.120 --> 04:09.620]  Seeing what you're throwing at me.
[04:09.620 --> 04:11.300]  I mean, you, yeah.
[04:13.080 --> 04:16.180]  You're willing it into the universe. I don't like it.
[04:16.560 --> 04:17.060]  I don't like it.
[04:17.160 --> 04:17.440]  Wow.
[04:17.540 --> 04:20.520]  It's happened every year without fail the entire time we've done this.
[04:20.600 --> 04:22.440]  It's fair. It's fair. I just don't like it on the board.
[04:22.500 --> 04:24.560]  I don't like seeing it first thing overall. I'm not a fan of it.
[04:24.820 --> 04:29.300]  Okay. That's Gavin's first prediction. Nick, what is your first prediction for 2025?
[04:29.860 --> 04:34.920]  Well, we've been playing a certain game a lot lately and we're big fans of it.
[04:34.980 --> 04:38.300]  And we've been anticipating the next release in said series.
[04:38.300 --> 04:41.420]  However, while it is scheduled to come out this year,
[04:41.520 --> 04:46.220]  I do believe that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be delayed until at least 2026.
[04:46.600 --> 04:48.280]  It's scheduled to come out next year, isn't it?
[04:48.300 --> 04:51.680]  They said 2025, but it's like they're so obviously going to delay it.
[04:52.000 --> 04:52.240]  Yeah.
[04:52.440 --> 04:52.640]  Yep.
[04:52.940 --> 04:53.860]  I'm here to win, baby.
[04:53.900 --> 04:54.380]  There you go.
[04:55.100 --> 05:01.120]  GTA 6 delayed to 2026. That is your 2025 prediction. Interesting. Andrew.
[05:01.500 --> 05:05.000]  I appreciate that we're all here to win, it appears so far.
[05:05.620 --> 05:08.560]  We're all going with certainties that we believe in.
[05:08.680 --> 05:10.820]  I don't believe it. First of all, I want to be clear.
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.120]  I'm not hoping for this. I'm trying to win this game.
[05:14.200 --> 05:15.840]  This is about predicting the future.
[05:16.140 --> 05:17.780]  Jeff, you might want to brace yourself, I feel.
[05:17.820 --> 05:18.740]  Oh boy, I'm braced.
[05:19.080 --> 05:23.000]  Statistical percentages. My first prediction is...
[05:23.360 --> 05:25.740]  Because it's all four of you apply to this category.
[05:26.060 --> 05:30.000]  I think one of you four is going to get divorced in the year 2025.
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.880]  Marriages have a 50% success rate.
[05:35.560 --> 05:37.100]  On the US on average.
[05:37.300 --> 05:43.080]  I'm not pulling for it, but statistically speaking, it seems possible.
[05:44.120 --> 05:46.540]  You said you didn't have any insider info, but now that...
[05:47.100 --> 05:50.020]  Who have you been talking to lately? Just out of curiosity?
[05:50.200 --> 05:53.060]  We're playing a dangerous game all of a sudden.
[05:53.400 --> 05:56.540]  I haven't been talking to anybody. I'm just looking at the data.
[05:57.100 --> 05:57.920]  I'm floored.
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.220]  Regulation divorce in 2025.
[06:00.640 --> 06:01.940]  That's your opening pick.
[06:01.940 --> 06:04.600]  That's my first pick because it's 50%.
[06:05.500 --> 06:07.660]  And I don't want it for any of you. I want to be clear.
[06:07.840 --> 06:10.060]  I don't want this to be accurate.
[06:10.360 --> 06:11.880]  But if I'm trying to win...
[06:11.880 --> 06:13.680]  No, yeah, you do. You do want it to be accurate.
[06:14.280 --> 06:14.560]  Yes, you do.
[06:14.560 --> 06:16.080]  No, I do want it to happen.
[06:16.380 --> 06:17.160]  There's two separate things.
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.600]  No, you absolutely want it to happen.
[06:18.600 --> 06:20.340]  No, because if you want to win, you want it to happen.
[06:20.620 --> 06:21.640]  There's two separate things.
[06:21.840 --> 06:25.140]  This pick is so evil, I'm holding your feet to the fire.
[06:25.620 --> 06:26.480]  Dude, there's two.
[06:26.500 --> 06:28.800]  You want it to happen because it is your...
[06:28.800 --> 06:30.280]  Shut up. It's your first pick.
[06:30.280 --> 06:34.720]  You made this your first pick.
[06:35.020 --> 06:36.460]  Who else was going to pick that?
[06:36.560 --> 06:41.560]  You said statistically, this is the one that you feel strongest about.
[06:42.040 --> 06:42.960]  This is the one.
[06:43.060 --> 06:44.740]  And you're saying, oh, I don't want it to happen.
[06:44.800 --> 06:45.480]  I don't want it to happen.
[06:45.620 --> 06:45.800]  I know.
[06:45.960 --> 06:46.460]  Yes, you do.
[06:46.640 --> 06:49.300]  Because you said you came to win.
[06:49.720 --> 06:51.060]  Yeah, because I'm playing.
[06:51.460 --> 06:53.080]  You want it to happen.
[06:53.080 --> 06:56.600]  I'm playing this game as a man of heartless statistics.
[06:57.240 --> 07:01.340]  Andrew, the person, does not want it to happen.
[07:01.780 --> 07:05.640]  Just because he thinks it'll happen doesn't mean he wants it to happen.
[07:06.080 --> 07:06.650]  Yes, he...
[07:07.420 --> 07:08.300]  This is insane.
[07:08.300 --> 07:09.180]  But I don't.
[07:09.340 --> 07:12.940]  No, he doesn't want it to happen, but he's just saying it's 50% likely to.
[07:13.160 --> 07:15.780]  But I have to acknowledge the statistics.
[07:16.360 --> 07:21.400]  He wants it to happen because he made it his first pick.
[07:22.440 --> 07:24.600]  I don't think it matters where I pick it.
[07:24.600 --> 07:27.560]  He said that he came to win.
[07:28.280 --> 07:32.220]  He's picking the thing that he thinks is going to happen.
[07:32.500 --> 07:36.000]  Yeah, he thinks it is going to happen, but he doesn't want it to happen.
[07:36.160 --> 07:37.300]  Yeah, I'm not even...
[07:37.300 --> 07:38.040]  I don't even...
[07:38.040 --> 07:41.440]  Statistically speaking, it's more likely than not.
[07:41.820 --> 07:43.840]  But I don't want Andrew to break his chair.
[07:44.200 --> 07:46.380]  You are making it your first pick.
[07:46.520 --> 07:47.560]  You want it to happen.
[07:47.860 --> 07:48.480]  I don't.
[07:48.540 --> 07:49.240]  You are.
[07:49.240 --> 07:50.460]  I want all you guys to be happy.
[07:50.820 --> 07:53.880]  I'll tell you what, if it happens, it's not going to be great for this podcast.
[07:54.500 --> 07:54.760]  Nope.
[07:55.180 --> 07:55.900]  No, I agree.
[07:56.200 --> 07:59.960]  That's like saying, Eric, that Nick wants GTA to get delayed.
[08:00.300 --> 08:00.800]  No, no, no.
[08:00.880 --> 08:04.300]  What I'm saying is what Andrew said.
[08:05.260 --> 08:07.380]  Andrew said that he came to win.
[08:08.020 --> 08:10.920]  He said that statistically this is the strongest.
[08:11.620 --> 08:13.900]  He said that he wants to win this.
[08:13.900 --> 08:14.380]  Well, based on data.
[08:14.460 --> 08:15.900]  This is all he wants.
[08:15.960 --> 08:16.960]  He wants it.
[08:17.140 --> 08:19.800]  He is putting it out there.
[08:19.800 --> 08:20.960]  I'm making the tough predictions.
[08:20.960 --> 08:24.480]  He just thinks it's the most likely thing to happen out of all his predictions.
[08:24.720 --> 08:24.820]  Right.
[08:25.140 --> 08:28.560]  And he came to win because he wants this.
[08:28.800 --> 08:30.040]  This is what I'm saying.
[08:30.140 --> 08:34.300]  I'm saying I'm willing to be bold enough to pick it because it is statistically.
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.960]  I'm not relenting on this.
[08:38.080 --> 08:40.240]  This is the craziest thing you could have picked.
[08:40.600 --> 08:40.920]  This is nuts.
[08:40.920 --> 08:41.980]  It's 50 percent.
[08:42.200 --> 08:44.920]  And then, you know, we don't need to go deeper.
[08:45.220 --> 08:48.560]  This is going to make my pick a lot seem really insignificant in comparison.
[08:49.280 --> 08:50.500]  Yeah, mine too.
[08:52.640 --> 08:55.620]  I said yesterday I had some spice on my predictions.
[08:55.900 --> 08:57.320]  You did, you did, you did.
[08:57.440 --> 08:58.000]  That's pretty spicy.
[08:59.180 --> 09:00.520]  That's insanely spicy.
[09:00.720 --> 09:01.700]  That's Carolina Reaper.
[09:01.920 --> 09:03.320]  There's some Scoville on the board.
[09:03.780 --> 09:03.940]  Yeah.
[09:04.600 --> 09:04.620]  Crazy.
[09:05.580 --> 09:05.980]  Crazy.
[09:06.500 --> 09:08.080]  Punches in the mouth with capsaicin.
[09:09.160 --> 09:09.560]  Wow.
[09:10.080 --> 09:10.680]  Where's the milk?
[09:11.300 --> 09:12.060]  Oh, God.
[09:12.220 --> 09:12.860]  We'll turn it around.
[09:12.940 --> 09:13.280]  It's fine.
[09:13.380 --> 09:14.720]  Listen, I got to pick two lined up.
[09:15.020 --> 09:17.040]  All right, Jeff, follow that.
[09:18.020 --> 09:19.460]  You see why I didn't want to be a swank?
[09:19.460 --> 09:20.980]  Yeah, I could definitely die.
[09:21.380 --> 09:22.120]  I wanted to.
[09:22.280 --> 09:24.620]  I wanted to come up with some really good predictions for y'all.
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.400]  Some things that I think are have a better than average chance of happening.
[09:29.780 --> 09:34.980]  I consulted with a local Oracle, and then I cross-referenced that with I hired a local
[09:35.720 --> 09:38.840]  diviner and got together, had a little quorum.
[09:39.180 --> 09:46.540]  And we think that the most likely outcome of 2025, I think swing music is going to become
[09:46.540 --> 09:47.180]  its annoying.
[09:48.020 --> 09:50.060]  It's going to enter into its annoying comeback.
[09:50.440 --> 09:52.100]  Yeah, we're going to have to deal with that shit again.
[09:52.300 --> 09:55.280]  It's going to be like a cherry pop and daddy's phase somewhere.
[09:55.980 --> 09:58.120]  Somewhere briefly for about three months in 2025.
[09:58.400 --> 09:59.160]  That's my prediction.
[09:59.720 --> 10:01.900]  Wow, that's crazy, dude.
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.520]  I don't want swing music back.
[10:03.720 --> 10:04.820]  It happened in 98.
[10:05.180 --> 10:06.460]  Yeah, could happen again.
[10:06.860 --> 10:08.080]  I just feel like the cycle is coming around.
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.840]  Also, my prediction on Andrew breaking the chair, I got it down to the month.
[10:11.880 --> 10:13.320]  I think it's going to happen in October.
[10:13.720 --> 10:14.860]  Oh, it's going to be late this year.
[10:14.960 --> 10:15.520]  I don't like it.
[10:15.680 --> 10:16.240]  It's pretty good.
[10:16.240 --> 10:17.700]  Oh, it's going to be late this year.
[10:17.760 --> 10:18.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:18.900 --> 10:20.140]  Well, he's being more careful.
[10:23.940 --> 10:25.080]  Standing desk September.
[10:25.380 --> 10:26.080]  He better be careful.
[10:26.140 --> 10:28.180]  He's making some fucking enemies in this podcast all of a sudden.
[10:28.320 --> 10:29.480]  Yeah, what do you mean enemies?
[10:29.900 --> 10:30.560]  Yeah, no kidding.
[10:30.780 --> 10:31.080]  Not me.
[10:31.140 --> 10:31.700]  I like you.
[10:31.780 --> 10:32.340]  I'm defending you.
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.180]  I'm talking about the other ones.
[10:33.200 --> 10:34.160]  The ones that have their knives out.
[10:34.820 --> 10:35.160]  Jesus.
[10:35.880 --> 10:36.920]  I came to win.
[10:37.040 --> 10:39.340]  Here's the thing that I think is going to happen right on.
[10:39.340 --> 10:42.140]  Based on statistical data that I have nothing to do with.
[10:42.180 --> 10:42.960]  Here's my pick.
[10:43.180 --> 10:45.120]  GTA 6 releases this year.
[10:45.120 --> 10:46.100]  Oh, hell yeah.
[10:46.240 --> 10:47.560]  I like that one a lot.
[10:47.700 --> 10:48.420]  That's a good pick, Eric.
[10:48.680 --> 10:49.460]  Yeah, me too.
[10:49.780 --> 10:51.520]  You see how this is fun?
[10:51.760 --> 10:53.840]  You see how it's a fun thing that we're doing?
[10:53.840 --> 10:54.660]  I'm cheering for that one.
[10:55.160 --> 10:56.460]  You're not going to like my next pick then.
[10:56.860 --> 11:00.420]  Oh, my God.
[11:00.840 --> 11:02.520]  And we know somebody's going to be right here.
[11:02.680 --> 11:05.420]  Nick or Eric is going to be a little most redundancy.
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.640]  Yeah, either Nick or Eric will get a point.
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.520]  I like the contrast.
[11:08.860 --> 11:09.980]  Yeah, that's guaranteed points.
[11:10.460 --> 11:11.380]  That bumps...
[11:11.380 --> 11:14.460]  Nick picking that there bumped mine up to my first pick there.
[11:14.460 --> 11:16.340]  That was way lower on my list.
[11:16.940 --> 11:20.840]  I think that's a long shot one, but I feel like if Nick picked it first,
[11:20.940 --> 11:22.040]  I got to pick the opposite first.
[11:22.260 --> 11:22.900]  I think that's fun.
[11:23.720 --> 11:24.340]  I love it.
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.440]  That's a great pick, Eric.
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.660]  Boy, I want to pick no divorce in 2025, but I'm just not even good.
[11:30.720 --> 11:33.460]  I just don't want to get near anything like that.
[11:33.580 --> 11:34.680]  I just don't.
[11:35.080 --> 11:36.300]  I don't like it.
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.180]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[11:38.380 --> 11:39.140]  I don't like it either.
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.060]  Why? What do you know?
[11:40.060 --> 11:41.920]  Is what? Yeah.
[11:42.020 --> 11:44.700]  Do you have some insider info?
[11:45.040 --> 11:45.980]  What you've been talking to?
[11:46.240 --> 11:46.700]  God.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.620]  Well, I am going to go out on a limb.
[11:51.740 --> 11:56.240]  This is one that I don't know that I feel super strongly about,
[11:56.440 --> 11:59.480]  but I'm being inundated with it still.
[11:59.800 --> 12:06.480]  And it's that the movie Better Man came out starring Robbie Williams as a monkey.
[12:06.580 --> 12:09.900]  And I think Robbie Williams will die.
[12:10.060 --> 12:11.180]  In 2025.
[12:12.420 --> 12:13.380]  Holy shit.
[12:14.140 --> 12:17.860]  I feel like this was, I think it's too coincidental.
[12:18.080 --> 12:21.940]  He was too in the zeitgeist in a time where he didn't necessarily need to be.
[12:22.340 --> 12:24.740]  That's almost a tempting of fate.
[12:24.860 --> 12:29.360]  Like saying that your friends would get divorced this year in a fun game that,
[12:29.420 --> 12:31.760]  you know, it's just, it's tempting fate too much.
[12:31.780 --> 12:33.500]  And it's, it's just, it's playing with fire.
[12:33.620 --> 12:35.840]  He's only like 50 or something.
[12:36.240 --> 12:36.560]  Yes.
[12:36.780 --> 12:39.020]  But he was, he didn't even be the monkey in the movie.
[12:39.020 --> 12:39.780]  Yeah.
[12:39.840 --> 12:40.860]  He didn't even sing the monkey.
[12:41.220 --> 12:42.800]  No, he didn't even sing the monkey.
[12:43.000 --> 12:43.880]  He didn't be the monkey.
[12:44.200 --> 12:45.360]  He didn't.
[12:45.480 --> 12:47.540]  Robbie Williams, why didn't you be the monkey in the movie?
[12:47.960 --> 12:48.880]  That's what I'm saying.
[12:49.140 --> 12:50.420]  It makes sense.
[12:51.700 --> 12:52.820]  There you go.
[12:53.040 --> 12:55.300]  So I think Robbie Williams this year will die.
[12:55.840 --> 12:58.520]  Didn't Robbie Williams have an entire album that was swing music?
[12:59.160 --> 12:59.600]  Did he?
[13:02.060 --> 13:03.960]  Maybe that's his last act.
[13:04.340 --> 13:04.620]  Wow.
[13:04.700 --> 13:06.940]  So when he dies, it'll bring back swing music.
[13:06.940 --> 13:09.480]  And then, and then somebody takes him out the game.
[13:11.460 --> 13:12.280]  That's wild.
[13:12.900 --> 13:13.340]  Wow.
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.120]  Robbie Williams had swing when you're winning.
[13:17.680 --> 13:18.120]  Yeah.
[13:19.100 --> 13:20.340]  Sounds like something else.
[13:20.700 --> 13:21.620]  See, it's already started.
[13:21.760 --> 13:23.160]  The swing comebacks already begun.
[13:23.480 --> 13:25.020]  Yeah, but that was like 20 years ago.
[13:25.280 --> 13:25.720]  Man.
[13:25.860 --> 13:26.080]  Yeah.
[13:26.140 --> 13:28.380]  So was Robbie Williams, what we're talking about in 2025.
[13:28.540 --> 13:31.040]  I'm telling you, and he wasn't even the monkey in the movie, dude.
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.880]  Jeff, that is, that's the first death prediction we've had on this board.
[13:35.880 --> 13:37.600]  What are you feeling?
[13:37.800 --> 13:44.220]  Allow me to be a little ray of sunshine in these, in this dismal prediction landscape.
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.900]  I'm going to go the exact opposite direction that Eric has gone with Robbie Williams dying.
[13:51.220 --> 13:55.040]  I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but if he lives to December 13th,
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.660]  tonight, 2025, Dick Van Dyke will turn 100 years old in 2025.
[13:59.660 --> 14:06.680]  I predict that Dick Van Dyke lives through 2025 and makes it to the ripe old age of 100.
[14:06.900 --> 14:09.600]  I predict Dick Van Dyke won't die.
[14:09.740 --> 14:10.980]  So then he's not a failure.
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.660]  Yeah, he has a full life.
[14:12.800 --> 14:13.580]  Dick Van Dyke will succeed.
[14:13.820 --> 14:13.980]  Yeah.
[14:14.060 --> 14:17.140]  Like my friend Andrew Douglas says, he will have lived a full life.
[14:17.400 --> 14:17.780]  Full life.
[14:18.440 --> 14:20.400]  How does he feel about people that live 101?
[14:20.640 --> 14:22.020]  Is that like house money life?
[14:22.180 --> 14:22.960]  Like what is that?
[14:23.100 --> 14:25.000]  I think he called it bonus years.
[14:26.980 --> 14:28.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:28.340 --> 14:28.920]  I love that.
[14:28.920 --> 14:30.160]  Yeah, there you go.
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.100]  And I arrived at that, by the way, I hired a local profit and then
[14:36.220 --> 14:36.980]  I see.
[14:37.100 --> 14:39.460]  Did like a VPN thing or not a VPN.
[14:39.540 --> 14:39.920]  What do you call it?
[14:39.980 --> 14:42.040]  Like an online thing?
[14:43.400 --> 14:44.600]  I had some Zoom meetings.
[14:44.900 --> 14:46.340]  I'm not a tech guy.
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.020]  I had some Zoom meetings with a mystic and that's what we came up with.
[14:50.220 --> 14:52.400]  And the mystic thought that you're located in Brazil.
[14:52.580 --> 14:53.820]  You really tricked them.
[14:54.560 --> 14:56.940]  I don't connect directly to my mystics.
[14:56.940 --> 15:03.740]  When you're dealing with mystics and profits, you want to make sure it's end to end encrypted.

[15:47.720 --> 15:53.460]  Well, we've gotten through two of the second round picks and now reluctantly we go to Andrew
[15:53.460 --> 15:54.560]  for his second pick.
[15:54.760 --> 15:55.760]  Oh, this is a good pick.
[15:55.920 --> 15:57.820]  I feel really strongly about this.
[15:58.020 --> 15:59.460]  You felt really strongly about the first one.
[15:59.740 --> 16:01.040]  Well, statistically, yes.
[16:01.060 --> 16:03.280]  But this is one from my heart that I feel.
[16:03.520 --> 16:08.500]  This is one that I truly am as a person pulling for and I do.
[16:08.660 --> 16:09.620]  I really think it's going to happen.
[16:10.040 --> 16:16.920]  My second prediction is that Nick does some form of very public and generous act of charity
[16:16.920 --> 16:18.500]  that touches all of us.
[16:18.840 --> 16:19.920]  That's my prediction.
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.740]  Wow, that's such a specific, weird pick.
[16:24.040 --> 16:25.660]  I think he has it in him this year.
[16:25.960 --> 16:27.180]  I really I believe in him.
[16:27.580 --> 16:30.980]  I think getting a sense from Nick that he's a good guy.
[16:31.100 --> 16:34.640]  I think this will be the year that a big charitable act.
[16:35.320 --> 16:37.940]  You have just put a crushing weight upon me.
[16:38.520 --> 16:39.920]  This is how I'm feeling.
[16:40.140 --> 16:42.280]  I feel I just feel I can sense it in the air.
[16:42.940 --> 16:43.980]  How do I feel now?
[16:44.360 --> 16:45.560]  First time for everything.
[16:45.660 --> 16:47.640]  You know, I think I think you got it, man.
[16:48.600 --> 16:50.360]  I really think this is your year.
[16:50.540 --> 16:52.260]  Do you have any predictions about Andrew, Nick?
[16:52.340 --> 16:52.900]  You're up.
[16:53.260 --> 16:54.500]  Yeah, it is Nick's turn.
[16:54.600 --> 16:57.180]  I also have some thoughts about some Andrew stuff, but I'll get to it later.
[16:57.280 --> 16:59.240]  I'm just I'm curious, but it's OK.
[16:59.440 --> 16:59.640]  All right.
[16:59.640 --> 17:00.120]  Hey, here we go.
[17:00.200 --> 17:01.680]  Nick, it's up to you.
[17:01.740 --> 17:03.020]  Your second pick in this.
[17:03.100 --> 17:09.160]  This could potentially apply to Andrew, but I will say that statistically it will happen
[17:09.160 --> 17:10.260]  to one of us this year.
[17:10.860 --> 17:14.100]  This year, one of us will have a root canal.
[17:14.240 --> 17:15.540]  Yeah, that was on my list too.
[17:15.780 --> 17:16.580]  That was on my list.
[17:16.580 --> 17:18.020]  Oh, that's a good one.
[17:18.020 --> 17:18.400]  Yep.
[17:18.780 --> 17:19.320]  Root canal.
[17:19.980 --> 17:21.460]  Hopefully now it's Andrew.
[17:21.540 --> 17:23.160]  Why are you going to bring that shit into the universe?
[17:23.300 --> 17:24.460]  I'm sorry, Jeff.
[17:24.580 --> 17:24.980]  I'm sorry.
[17:25.320 --> 17:26.300]  It's not you, man.
[17:26.340 --> 17:30.420]  Why do you have to point a fucking sniper rifle at my mouth, you motherfucker?
[17:31.320 --> 17:35.940]  I hope the charity you perform this year is three root canals so the rest of us don't have to get them.
[17:36.780 --> 17:38.040]  Oh, I could ask my dad.
[17:38.100 --> 17:38.840]  He does root canals.
[17:39.040 --> 17:39.500]  He does.
[17:39.660 --> 17:40.320]  It's true.
[17:41.780 --> 17:43.760]  One of us will have a root canal.
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.700]  That was worse than a divorce one.
[17:45.700 --> 17:48.500]  Oh, now I will say, no, it's not.
[17:48.700 --> 17:49.000]  That's crazy.
[17:49.260 --> 17:51.620]  It's less personal.
[17:51.940 --> 17:52.820]  I'm just going off data.
[17:53.100 --> 17:53.700]  Yeah, but I will.
[17:53.880 --> 17:55.000]  I will be the divorce.
[17:55.220 --> 17:56.880]  I'll definitely be the root canal.
[17:57.520 --> 17:58.520]  Andrew's had a root canal.
[17:58.940 --> 18:00.560]  I haven't heard Gavin talk about his teeth.
[18:00.600 --> 18:02.080]  He probably hasn't looked at in ages.
[18:02.500 --> 18:04.060]  When was the last time you got your teeth looked at, Gavin?
[18:04.520 --> 18:05.560]  Yeah, six months ago.
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.240]  I've got on the 10th of Feb, I think.
[18:08.640 --> 18:11.740]  I mean, just just so we're all aware, it's I'm calling it right now.
[18:11.820 --> 18:12.740]  I might as well put it on the board.
[18:12.800 --> 18:13.520]  It will be me.
[18:13.820 --> 18:14.780]  I think it will be me.
[18:18.140 --> 18:19.640]  I'm not trying to will it in there.
[18:19.740 --> 18:21.960]  I'm just letting you know that I think it's going to be me.
[18:22.240 --> 18:24.040]  See, Jeff, I'm not directing it at you.
[18:24.200 --> 18:25.700]  What a crazy year for Eric.
[18:26.500 --> 18:29.980]  GTA 6 comes out, Robbie Williams dies, and he gets a root canal.
[18:30.600 --> 18:31.000]  Crazy.
[18:31.460 --> 18:33.300]  And what you're hoping for, a divorce.
[18:33.540 --> 18:33.800]  But Gavin...
[18:33.800 --> 18:34.960]  I'm not hoping for it.
[18:35.160 --> 18:36.820]  It's statistically probable.
[18:37.180 --> 18:41.080]  In this R.W. Nostradamus draft here, what is your prediction?
[18:41.600 --> 18:43.320]  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a lot of shit on this board.
[18:43.320 --> 18:45.520]  A lot of dark sort of dread.
[18:46.120 --> 18:47.680]  So I'm going to take a page from Jeff.
[18:47.900 --> 18:49.560]  Jeff's book and have a little ray of sunshine one.
[18:49.720 --> 18:53.060]  I think a new pasta shape will be invented.
[18:55.060 --> 18:56.720]  What do you think it will be?
[18:58.700 --> 18:59.180]  Well...
[18:59.780 --> 19:00.260]  Anyone?
[19:01.340 --> 19:06.460]  I mean, I was going to say we were on the road to inventing the boot shaped pasta, remember?
[19:06.900 --> 19:10.480]  So you can fill it with pasta like you're putting your feet in the boot.
[19:10.820 --> 19:12.920]  Has anyone made pasta countries?
[19:13.600 --> 19:16.060]  Like just the shape of the shapes of all the countries?
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.120]  Like, you know, you get a little spoonful of Russia, bit of France.
[19:21.220 --> 19:22.020]  I like that.
[19:22.260 --> 19:22.960]  A little bit of France.
[19:23.560 --> 19:29.480]  I think the most recent pasta shape was this cascatelli, I think is what it was called.
[19:29.780 --> 19:30.180]  Interesting.
[19:30.460 --> 19:30.840]  When's that?
[19:30.840 --> 19:33.340]  I think that's a 20, I think it's a 2019 invention.
[19:33.560 --> 19:34.700]  I think it's a pre-pandemic invention.
[19:35.220 --> 19:36.040]  Yeah, we're definitely due.
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.660]  I think we're due one, yeah.
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.100]  Yeah, but Gavin, a new pasta shape is your second round pick.
[19:42.100 --> 19:43.720]  What is your third round pick here?
[19:44.260 --> 19:46.520]  Oh, interesting.
[19:47.060 --> 19:52.560]  I'm going to go with professional athlete accidentally kills a crowd member.
[19:53.160 --> 19:53.660]  Oh my God.
[19:54.940 --> 19:56.000]  Back to darkness.
[19:56.200 --> 19:57.180]  Yep, could happen.
[19:57.700 --> 19:58.580]  Think it may be golf.
[19:58.780 --> 19:59.900]  Might be golf this time.
[20:00.460 --> 20:01.520]  You think golf does it?
[20:02.240 --> 20:02.460]  Yeah.
[20:03.040 --> 20:04.260]  Oh, they're right there, dude.
[20:04.580 --> 20:05.960]  All it takes is a hook and you're...
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.280]  I think it could be tennis.
[20:09.960 --> 20:10.440]  Tennis?
[20:11.060 --> 20:11.340]  Yeah.
[20:11.340 --> 20:17.300]  I think someone's going to get mad and they're going to hit a ball into the stands at someone.
[20:17.400 --> 20:18.200]  It's going to hit someone.
[20:18.380 --> 20:19.160]  They're going to be old.
[20:19.380 --> 20:20.420]  It's going to take them out of the game.
[20:20.720 --> 20:21.600]  Hit them right in the throat.
[20:21.680 --> 20:22.280]  They can't breathe.
[20:22.440 --> 20:22.800]  They're frail.
[20:23.500 --> 20:24.740]  Oh yeah, maybe in the throat.
[20:25.100 --> 20:26.260]  Or they fall to their death.
[20:26.580 --> 20:26.660]  Yeah.
[20:26.780 --> 20:29.060]  Has anyone ever been killed by a tennis ball?
[20:29.280 --> 20:30.060]  They're so soft.
[20:30.360 --> 20:32.100]  I mean, they're not soft, but compared to a cricket ball.
[20:32.400 --> 20:36.620]  Yeah, I mean, it just feels like it's one of those sports where the spectators are close.
[20:36.700 --> 20:39.060]  The ball doesn't lose a ton of velocity.
[20:39.060 --> 20:42.000]  And I could see it hitting someone and it becoming a big problem.
[20:42.000 --> 20:42.520]  I can.
[20:42.680 --> 20:42.800]  Yeah.
[20:42.900 --> 20:46.020]  I mean, Happy Gilmore's dad died at a hockey game.
[20:46.160 --> 20:47.680]  Happy Gilmore 2 is coming out this year.
[20:47.760 --> 20:49.180]  I think it all could connect.
[20:49.760 --> 20:50.800]  You'd have another death.
[20:51.980 --> 20:53.220]  Sports related incident.
[20:53.640 --> 20:54.500]  I think it's a good pick.
[20:54.780 --> 20:55.820]  It's a very good pick, Gavin.
[20:56.700 --> 20:57.100]  Thanks.
[20:58.060 --> 20:59.940]  Nick, what do you think in your third pick?
[21:00.240 --> 21:01.240]  Your third prediction?
[21:03.140 --> 21:07.620]  I think this is a little bit of sunshine on an otherwise rainy day.
[21:07.680 --> 21:07.920]  Okay.
[21:07.920 --> 21:11.140]  And especially for Jeff, because I think Jeff is going to be the
[21:11.140 --> 21:13.320]  only one of us to hit the average amount of hot dogs.
[21:13.340 --> 21:13.880]  Come on.
[21:18.900 --> 21:20.580]  Now, what is the average number?
[21:22.220 --> 21:23.020]  170 or something.
[21:23.140 --> 21:24.140]  No, I think it was 70.
[21:24.380 --> 21:25.040]  Yeah, 70.
[21:25.380 --> 21:30.900]  This is the, to me, the funniest pick of the whole thing.
[21:31.240 --> 21:32.880]  That's a very strong pick, dude.
[21:32.940 --> 21:33.940]  That's very good.
[21:34.320 --> 21:37.400]  To be fair, I think I've only had one hot dog in January.
[21:37.400 --> 21:38.540]  So I'm falling behind.
[21:38.840 --> 21:39.900]  Oh, man.
[21:40.260 --> 21:40.920]  I trust you.
[21:41.120 --> 21:42.060]  Now there's pressure on you.
[21:42.180 --> 21:42.960]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[21:43.080 --> 21:44.160]  I think that was a pretty safe bet.
[21:44.240 --> 21:44.820]  Now that's on the board.
[21:44.880 --> 21:45.520]  I have to do it.
[21:45.760 --> 21:46.220]  There you go.
[21:48.360 --> 21:50.240]  I definitely think you can do it.
[21:50.860 --> 21:54.780]  And then, begrudgingly, we go back to Andrew with his third pick.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.680]  The boldest pick I think anyone could make.
[21:59.900 --> 22:00.960]  You've already done, right?
[22:01.020 --> 22:01.980]  Yeah, right.
[22:02.080 --> 22:02.900]  Your first pick.
[22:03.520 --> 22:04.300]  Third pick.
[22:04.740 --> 22:07.160]  And it's third because it's, you know, so bold.
[22:07.400 --> 22:11.120]  I think Arizona Iced Tea will be raised above $0.99 this year.
[22:12.080 --> 22:14.380]  I think they finally have to go over.
[22:14.380 --> 22:16.700]  They can no longer hold the $0.99 price point.
[22:16.820 --> 22:18.080]  Their whole thing.
[22:18.360 --> 22:19.380]  That's their whole gimmick.
[22:19.800 --> 22:20.840]  I think it falls this year.
[22:21.120 --> 22:22.060]  How long has it been $0.99?
[22:22.740 --> 22:23.320]  Their whole time.
[22:23.360 --> 22:24.880]  The entire time I think they've existed.
[22:26.020 --> 22:27.520]  I'd assume that's their whole gimmick.
[22:27.880 --> 22:28.060]  Yeah.
[22:28.560 --> 22:30.460]  So I think Arizona Iced Tea over $0.99.
[22:30.700 --> 22:31.500]  I think it finally happens.
[22:31.900 --> 22:34.280]  Now, this isn't part of the prediction, but just out of curiosity to you,
[22:34.380 --> 22:35.640]  what price do you arrive at?
[22:35.640 --> 22:38.160]  I'm going to say $1.15.
[22:38.640 --> 22:38.980]  $1.15.
[22:39.240 --> 22:40.600]  I'd say $1.29.
[22:41.380 --> 22:43.140]  $1.29 is a...
[22:43.140 --> 22:44.240]  Yeah, I think that's...
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.200]  But then they say jumps $0.30 in like all the headlines.
[22:48.340 --> 22:49.420]  And that's a lot.
[22:49.880 --> 22:54.720]  I think $0.15 is, you know, it's an easier pill to swallow.
[22:55.080 --> 23:00.960]  I will say, I thought what Andrew was doing here was giving predictions about all of us.
[23:01.400 --> 23:01.740]  No.
[23:02.400 --> 23:05.440]  And so don't clutch your fucking pearls.
[23:05.640 --> 23:08.920]  I thought that you were doing predictions about all of us.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.640]  So I was very curious to see who the final two were,
[23:11.720 --> 23:16.480]  because that would narrow down who he thought the divorce was truly about.
[23:16.800 --> 23:20.580]  I thought it was going to be like, it could be anyone.
[23:20.820 --> 23:22.200]  And then here's one about Nick.
[23:22.260 --> 23:23.580]  And then here's one about Jeff.
[23:23.640 --> 23:24.900]  And then here's one about Gavin.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.040]  And it's like, boy, I wonder who the divorce could have been about.
[23:28.680 --> 23:30.980]  I've been clear this entire time.
[23:31.100 --> 23:33.860]  It is purely based on a 50 percentile.
[23:33.960 --> 23:35.040]  That is statistics.
[23:35.660 --> 23:37.100]  It's a coin flip.
[23:37.100 --> 23:39.580]  I don't want any of this to happen.
[23:39.900 --> 23:41.220]  Don't agree with that.
[23:41.360 --> 23:42.260]  You do, but it's fine.
[23:42.320 --> 23:45.820]  But here's what Jeff predicts is going to happen in 2025.
[23:46.420 --> 23:48.560]  I think this is one that everybody wants to happen.
[23:48.660 --> 23:50.120]  I bet it's not on anyone's radar.
[23:50.760 --> 23:55.620]  I haven't done any research into the matter other than I consulted a local forecaster
[23:55.620 --> 23:58.180]  and then also hired a soothsayer.
[23:58.820 --> 24:05.860]  We cross-referenced all and came up with the prediction that in 2025, a new dog breed is
[24:05.860 --> 24:06.440]  going to drop.
[24:08.740 --> 24:09.880]  A new dog?
[24:10.300 --> 24:12.980]  Yeah, we're going to get a new dog breed, a boutique dog breed.
[24:13.020 --> 24:14.240]  It's going to be some kind of doodle, maybe.
[24:14.480 --> 24:15.020]  Who knows?
[24:15.360 --> 24:17.400]  That is such a good prediction.
[24:17.740 --> 24:21.640]  And Jeff, can I say, can I piggyback off of this?
[24:21.700 --> 24:23.480]  Because it was going to be my fourth pick.
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.280]  I'm moving it up to my third now because I'm the last two
[24:27.840 --> 24:28.380]  in these.
[24:29.220 --> 24:33.000]  I have a dog speaks.
[24:33.740 --> 24:34.160]  Whoa!
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.200]  I think your new dog is going to say a single word.
[24:38.540 --> 24:40.520]  I don't think it's going to be a whole sentence.
[24:40.820 --> 24:43.000]  I think a dog is going to say, like, food.
[24:43.380 --> 24:47.280]  Like, it's going to be, I think a dog will talk this year.
[24:47.640 --> 24:49.820]  I don't think a dog can make an F sound.
[24:50.360 --> 24:50.900]  I don't.
[24:50.980 --> 24:51.880]  But here's the thing.
[24:52.120 --> 24:54.580]  Jeff is predicting a new kind of dog.
[24:54.960 --> 24:56.500]  This is a dog that can say S.
[24:56.500 --> 25:01.460]  Is there a list of current dog syllables or, like, dog mouth sounds that they can make?
[25:01.620 --> 25:03.760]  A list of dog syllables.
[25:05.420 --> 25:07.320]  How many syllables in dog?
[25:07.480 --> 25:08.780]  That's not what I'm looking for.
[25:09.980 --> 25:11.820]  What do you mean a dog can't make an F sound?
[25:11.900 --> 25:12.340]  It says woof.
[25:16.100 --> 25:17.180]  Think about it.
[25:17.260 --> 25:18.740]  That's so close to saying food.
[25:18.860 --> 25:19.920]  It's almost just backwards.
[25:21.520 --> 25:24.220]  When did the last dog drop, by the way?
[25:24.600 --> 25:25.680]  Golden doodle, maybe?
[25:25.680 --> 25:29.580]  When was the newest dog breed?
[25:29.800 --> 25:32.080]  You think this one's going to be a corgi doodle or some shit?
[25:32.260 --> 25:32.360]  Yeah.
[25:32.580 --> 25:33.140]  Corgi doodle.
[25:33.500 --> 25:34.680]  A bison frieze doodle.
[25:35.020 --> 25:37.740]  The Danish-Swedish... whoa.
[25:38.840 --> 25:39.480]  Jeff.
[25:40.020 --> 25:40.420]  Okay.
[25:40.680 --> 25:41.080]  Yeah.
[25:41.540 --> 25:47.300]  The Danish-Swedish farm dog was the newest dog breed recognized by the AKC,
[25:47.420 --> 25:52.280]  which is the American Kennel Club, in January of 2025.
[25:53.140 --> 25:55.060]  I've already been proven correct.
[25:55.060 --> 25:56.140]  That's invalid, then.
[25:56.440 --> 25:58.740]  A new dog has dropped.
[25:59.500 --> 26:01.000]  You can't predict something that's already happened.
[26:01.460 --> 26:02.340]  I had no idea.
[26:02.800 --> 26:03.680]  I did no research.
[26:04.060 --> 26:05.460]  I don't think it's still full, but I think...
[26:05.460 --> 26:07.520]  You know what? We can invalidate that one.
[26:07.680 --> 26:09.480]  We still have 11 months of new dogs.
[26:09.540 --> 26:09.720]  Okay.
[26:09.960 --> 26:10.920]  Another new dog breed.
[26:11.460 --> 26:11.600]  Wow.
[26:12.180 --> 26:12.620]  Wow.
[26:13.000 --> 26:13.380]  Wow.
[26:13.720 --> 26:14.120]  Insane.
[26:14.320 --> 26:14.860]  That's crazy.
[26:15.320 --> 26:15.500]  This is so exciting.
[26:15.980 --> 26:17.720]  This is so exciting.
[26:18.340 --> 26:19.900]  I didn't know dogs were still coming out.
[26:20.320 --> 26:20.980]  Oh, constantly.
[26:21.160 --> 26:22.180]  Dogs and apples, dude.
[26:22.300 --> 26:23.280]  Dogs and apples.
[26:23.380 --> 26:24.140]  You'd be surprised.
[26:24.740 --> 26:26.380]  They're breeding dogs with apples.
[26:26.560 --> 26:28.180]  One of them is going to say the word food.
[26:28.360 --> 26:30.100]  I think one dog will speak this year.
[26:30.360 --> 26:32.000]  It's going to be a thing in the news where it's like,
[26:32.100 --> 26:34.000]  this dog said a word, and it will...
[26:34.000 --> 26:34.520]  And it's called?
[26:34.860 --> 26:35.420]  It will speak.
[26:35.900 --> 26:36.500]  I think it's going to happen.
[26:36.680 --> 26:36.940]  It's called Dapple.
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.220]  It's this apple dog.
[26:40.100 --> 26:40.500]  Dapple.
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.480]  I'm going to stick with, for my final pick, this prediction for 2025.
[26:47.740 --> 26:49.000]  I'm going to stay British.
[26:50.400 --> 26:50.840]  Uh...
[26:50.840 --> 26:51.600]  I'm...
[26:52.200 --> 26:54.280]  I think that this is a surefire one.
[26:54.720 --> 26:57.060]  I don't think it's that outrageous.
[26:57.520 --> 26:58.820]  I think it's going to happen.
[26:59.040 --> 27:00.720]  And it's going to be Oasis breaks up again.
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.720]  Oh, I was going to say Brexit 2.
[27:03.820 --> 27:04.540]  Yeah, they are...
[27:07.940 --> 27:13.780]  I think Oasis will play some of their concerts and then refund a lot of people a lot of money.
[27:14.160 --> 27:15.800]  Oh, you don't even think they finish the tour?
[27:16.120 --> 27:16.800]  I don't think so.
[27:16.820 --> 27:17.940]  I think they're going to break up.
[27:17.940 --> 27:20.560]  I think it's going to be a very early...
[27:20.560 --> 27:25.480]  I don't think early, but I think it will be earlier than before they're done with everything.
[27:25.680 --> 27:28.400]  I think Oasis is not making it to the end of that tour.
[27:28.620 --> 27:30.140]  I like that prediction a lot.
[27:30.200 --> 27:31.040]  I think that's a good one.
[27:31.360 --> 27:32.780]  Yeah, I feel pretty strongly about it.
[27:32.780 --> 27:35.840]  I have a lot of honorable mentions too, which we can go over here after we do our whole list.
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.700]  But a dog speaks and Oasis breaks up are my final two picks.
[27:40.240 --> 27:44.340]  Hey Fidelity, how can I remember to invest every month?
[27:44.340 --> 27:51.580]  With the Fidelity app, you can choose a schedule and set up recurring investments in stocks and ETFs.
[27:52.080 --> 27:53.740]  Oh, that sounds easier than I thought.
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.020]  You got this.
[27:55.320 --> 27:56.440]  Yeah, I do.
[27:56.820 --> 27:58.560]  Now, where did I put my keys?

[28:40.120 --> 28:42.740]  And we go to Jeff, who predicted a new dog,
[28:42.820 --> 28:44.720]  which already occurred this year, but we are invalidating.
[28:44.860 --> 28:45.600]  Jeff, go ahead.
[28:47.080 --> 28:48.280]  I'm of two minds.
[28:50.300 --> 28:52.900]  I have a sports prediction I feel really good about,
[28:52.960 --> 28:55.100]  but I have an internal prediction as well.
[28:55.400 --> 28:56.720]  I just don't know which one.
[28:58.360 --> 29:00.900]  Ah, Andrew's first pick really makes me want to pick this one.
[29:01.600 --> 29:02.220]  You know what, fuck it.
[29:02.720 --> 29:05.640]  I'm going to say in 2025, I predict...
[29:05.640 --> 29:06.700]  Andrew eats the pencil.
[29:07.340 --> 29:07.860]  Whoa!
[29:12.480 --> 29:13.520]  Andrew, 2025.
[29:14.300 --> 29:14.740]  Wow.
[29:15.540 --> 29:16.520]  I'm just trying to confirm that...
[29:17.160 --> 29:20.160]  Yeah, I think it's the first one that's already not right.
[29:23.100 --> 29:26.600]  I think it might be the first definitely didn't happen one.
[29:27.320 --> 29:28.120]  What do you mean?
[29:28.960 --> 29:32.340]  What if you raised a hundred grand for Nick's charity to eat the pencil?
[29:32.520 --> 29:32.880]  Wow!
[29:33.240 --> 29:33.400]  Yeah!
[29:34.400 --> 29:35.080]  I don't want to...
[29:35.080 --> 29:35.980]  That's Nick's thing.
[29:35.980 --> 29:37.220]  I don't want to get in the way of his thing.
[29:37.300 --> 29:38.100]  That's his big moment.
[29:38.360 --> 29:39.700]  What if one of us got divorced?
[29:42.800 --> 29:47.880]  What if you eating a pencil gave an MRI machine to a children's hospital?
[29:48.340 --> 29:48.740]  Wow!
[29:49.500 --> 29:50.900]  And Nick did it.
[29:51.600 --> 29:52.780]  And somehow Nick.
[29:53.280 --> 29:53.660]  Yeah!
[29:54.380 --> 29:58.000]  It's really nice that you eating that whole bag of wet bread is what led to that moment.
[30:01.200 --> 30:03.200]  It was a bed of wet bread, I think, wasn't it?
[30:04.040 --> 30:05.380]  Oh, man.
[30:05.660 --> 30:05.900]  The wet bed?
[30:07.680 --> 30:10.740]  Well, Andrew eats the pencil is Jeff's final prediction.
[30:11.280 --> 30:11.620]  Could happen.
[30:12.320 --> 30:15.960]  And then we got Andrew, who's going to give us his final evil prediction.
[30:16.340 --> 30:17.940]  My last predi... not evil.
[30:18.180 --> 30:21.380]  I went statistically probable, what I feel in my heart,
[30:21.440 --> 30:24.380]  and then what I think will be the cold reality of the world.
[30:24.900 --> 30:32.940]  My last prediction is that an international incident will occur due to a weather balloon
[30:34.200 --> 30:36.400]  related problem involving Al Pacino.
[30:38.580 --> 30:39.060]  Okay.
[30:39.480 --> 30:42.020]  Al Pacino weather balloon incident. Thank you.
[30:42.460 --> 30:44.880]  So it just makes me really curious about your first pick,
[30:44.920 --> 30:46.280]  where you said you really want to win.
[30:46.460 --> 30:49.000]  And then your last pick is weather balloon Al Pacino incident.
[30:49.320 --> 30:52.420]  This is the flex pick where when this happens,
[30:52.520 --> 30:55.420]  you guys will be like, holy fuck, he is Nostradamus.
[30:55.700 --> 30:57.020]  That is the point of this pick.
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.300]  So how does the Pacino factor?
[31:00.900 --> 31:02.600]  He is just there. He's part of it.
[31:02.600 --> 31:03.480]  What do you mean?
[31:04.140 --> 31:07.480]  It'll be made clear when it happens.
[31:07.820 --> 31:10.460]  Yeah, you'll get more details at that time.
[31:11.080 --> 31:14.080]  He, Al Pacino, known to like to fly in weather balloons.
[31:15.100 --> 31:15.580]  Is that right?
[31:15.740 --> 31:16.020]  Is that a fact about him?
[31:16.520 --> 31:17.920]  I don't know. I just made it up.
[31:18.100 --> 31:19.560]  But he can't fly in a weather balloon.
[31:20.220 --> 31:21.860]  Well, what is a weather balloon?
[31:21.960 --> 31:23.660]  What's the big balloon that people ride in?
[31:23.800 --> 31:24.320]  Hot air balloon?
[31:24.340 --> 31:24.960]  A hot air balloon.
[31:24.960 --> 31:26.580]  Hot air. Yeah, a hot air balloon.
[31:27.040 --> 31:27.780]  That's what I meant.
[31:29.460 --> 31:33.420]  So if the prediction's wrong, it's based on my not understanding of balloons.
[31:33.460 --> 31:35.200]  Is it hot air balloon or weather balloon?
[31:35.200 --> 31:36.440]  Let's go hot air balloon.
[31:36.880 --> 31:39.380]  A weather balloon is just, they release it.
[31:39.460 --> 31:41.280]  It goes real high to take measurements of...
[31:41.280 --> 31:44.080]  Now, it's going to be really fucking funny if there's a specific weather balloon.
[31:44.400 --> 31:48.340]  I swear to God, if Al Pacino gets in a weather balloon related incident, I'd fucking...
[31:49.780 --> 31:50.820]  I'd be so mad.
[31:51.120 --> 31:53.600]  Hot air balloon Al Pacino incident.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.100]  Do you remember the balloon boy hoax?
[31:57.100 --> 31:57.820]  Of course.
[31:58.360 --> 31:58.380]  In 2009?
[31:58.840 --> 32:00.000]  It's not going to be a hoax.
[32:00.260 --> 32:04.980]  It's going to be Al Pacino in a hot air balloon, and he's going to get loose,
[32:05.260 --> 32:07.680]  and something's going to happen, and it's not going to be good for anybody.
[32:08.320 --> 32:12.880]  He survives the incident, doesn't die, but it causes a problem.
[32:13.260 --> 32:15.360]  He's luckier than Robbie Williams, is what you're saying.
[32:15.560 --> 32:15.900]  Yes.
[32:16.760 --> 32:21.760]  This actually might be how Robbie Williams dies, is via Al Pacino's hot air balloon.
[32:22.060 --> 32:24.720]  And then the dog sees it, and he goes, oh my God.
[32:27.340 --> 32:31.500]  Uh, Nick, what is your final prediction for Are We Nostradamus?
[32:31.900 --> 32:37.600]  I think in 2025, there will be a new world's hottest pepper.
[32:38.040 --> 32:40.520]  The last time we had one was 2023.
[32:41.080 --> 32:45.220]  It was Pepper X, and it's 2.69 million Scovilles.
[32:45.500 --> 32:46.000]  Fuck that.
[32:46.340 --> 32:47.200]  Are you going to try to eat it?
[32:47.760 --> 32:49.560]  If it's out, yes.
[32:50.000 --> 32:50.460]  Really?
[32:51.100 --> 32:51.340]  Yeah.
[32:51.440 --> 32:52.400]  No, for charity.
[32:53.640 --> 32:55.940]  If people raise money for charity.
[32:58.480 --> 33:00.480]  Pepper X is disgusting looking.
[33:00.800 --> 33:04.720]  I don't... it looks... Pepper X looks sickly.
[33:05.020 --> 33:05.340]  Yeah.
[33:05.720 --> 33:07.700]  It's got like gangles.
[33:08.440 --> 33:10.280]  It looks like a prolapsed asshole.
[33:10.540 --> 33:11.020]  It does.
[33:11.360 --> 33:11.380]  Oh God.
[33:11.780 --> 33:13.740]  Like a boneless wing that has no meat on it.
[33:13.840 --> 33:14.140]  Yeah.
[33:14.720 --> 33:15.720]  I don't like this.
[33:15.980 --> 33:19.340]  This is the kind of thing that people have like a real weird like,
[33:19.440 --> 33:22.020]  oh, I have like a phobia of stuff that looks like this.
[33:22.040 --> 33:23.020]  And you're like, I've never heard of that.
[33:23.100 --> 33:24.600]  Then you look at it and you go, oh, I get it.
[33:24.600 --> 33:25.020]  Yeah.
[33:25.060 --> 33:27.100]  We've evolved to look at that and go, ooh.
[33:27.440 --> 33:28.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:29.240 --> 33:29.620]  Yep.
[33:30.120 --> 33:31.820]  Maybe that's the new pasta shape.
[33:32.820 --> 33:33.620]  Fucked up.
[33:36.360 --> 33:37.740]  The whoops batch.
[33:38.020 --> 33:41.100]  Well, that Nick predicting the new world's hottest pepper.
[33:41.480 --> 33:43.320]  Gavin, what is your final prediction?
[33:43.520 --> 33:48.580]  What are you saying is happening this year in the Are We Nostradamus predictions draft?
[33:50.520 --> 33:51.120]  Great.
[33:52.160 --> 33:52.660]  Dino!
[33:52.660 --> 33:53.000]  Dino!
[33:54.060 --> 33:55.340]  What's a J?
[33:55.980 --> 33:56.540]  No.
[33:57.520 --> 33:58.780]  Did I get like double donged?
[33:58.860 --> 33:59.260]  What's a...
[33:59.260 --> 34:00.260]  What is it?
[34:00.400 --> 34:02.040]  Dino dot jfufufufu.
[34:02.120 --> 34:03.580]  What's a J-fifth?
[34:03.860 --> 34:04.100]  I don't know.
[34:04.260 --> 34:04.620]  What's a J-fifth?
[34:04.740 --> 34:06.780]  JPEG file interchange format.
[34:07.240 --> 34:08.120]  Okay, let me...
[34:08.120 --> 34:08.860]  It didn't interchange.
[34:11.620 --> 34:14.500]  My prediction is Gavin's last pick is dog shit.
[34:15.000 --> 34:15.120]  Yeah.
[34:15.840 --> 34:16.740]  Save as.
[34:17.140 --> 34:17.460]  Okay.
[34:18.260 --> 34:18.500]  Okay.
[34:19.920 --> 34:20.480]  JPEG.
[34:20.800 --> 34:21.060]  Okay.
[34:21.280 --> 34:21.560]  Yeah.
[34:21.780 --> 34:22.260]  Save.
[34:22.840 --> 34:23.360]  Okay.
[34:24.160 --> 34:24.680]  Then.
[34:25.140 --> 34:25.660]  Okay.
[34:26.120 --> 34:26.560]  Yes.
[34:27.280 --> 34:27.640]  Got it.
[34:28.640 --> 34:28.880]  Oh.
[34:29.460 --> 34:29.800]  Oh.
[34:30.180 --> 34:30.340]  Oh.
[34:30.700 --> 34:31.860]  Sort by date.
[34:32.160 --> 34:32.820]  Keep all this in.
[34:33.140 --> 34:33.640]  You got it.
[34:33.680 --> 34:34.780]  It's all super usable stuff.
[34:35.420 --> 34:36.240]  Dinosaurs reboot.
[34:36.820 --> 34:37.080]  Oh!
[34:37.960 --> 34:39.560]  Did not see that coming.
[34:40.920 --> 34:41.200]  Nope.
[34:42.320 --> 34:42.840]  Okay.
[34:42.980 --> 34:46.320]  Do you think it picks up where they left off at the ice age hitting?
[34:46.480 --> 34:47.760]  Or is it just a fresh reboot?
[34:48.020 --> 34:48.860]  Yeah, they all die at the end.
[34:50.840 --> 34:51.200]  Do...
[34:52.660 --> 34:55.160]  Is the sitcom still a format?
[34:55.740 --> 34:56.520]  You know what I mean?
[34:56.680 --> 34:56.880]  Yeah.
[34:57.440 --> 34:59.620]  Yeah, Tim Allen just got a new fucking sitcom.
[35:00.140 --> 35:00.340]  That's true.
[35:00.500 --> 35:01.280]  A month ago.
[35:03.240 --> 35:05.080]  And Sean William Scott or whatever.
[35:05.540 --> 35:07.180]  He's in it or he also has a sitcom?
[35:07.640 --> 35:08.140]  No, he's in it.
[35:08.180 --> 35:08.700]  He's like the neighbor.
[35:09.100 --> 35:09.460]  Oh, okay.
[35:09.980 --> 35:10.760]  Good for him.
[35:11.500 --> 35:11.800]  Do you...
[35:11.800 --> 35:13.080]  So are you pulling for this, Gavin?
[35:13.120 --> 35:14.380]  Are you a big Dinosaurs fan?
[35:14.880 --> 35:17.920]  No, I mean, I saw it on TV before I went to school a few times.
[35:18.860 --> 35:19.440]  Not the mama.
[35:20.040 --> 35:22.920]  Yeah, I don't really have any connection to it, too.
[35:23.920 --> 35:26.400]  And you just think Dinosaurs are popular right now,
[35:26.460 --> 35:28.680]  and they'll bring it back in sort of this era of...
[35:28.680 --> 35:29.400]  I think they'll reboot it.
[35:29.880 --> 35:30.240]  Reboots.
[35:30.780 --> 35:32.460]  Honestly, it's not a bad prediction.
[35:32.560 --> 35:34.200]  Not even because Dinosaurs are popular,
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.300]  but it's one of those things where like a company doesn't want to lose an IP.
[35:37.540 --> 35:40.240]  So they just do it to do it.
[35:40.320 --> 35:42.380]  And you go, why the fuck are they doing that?
[35:42.400 --> 35:45.400]  And they're like, well, yeah, they just didn't want to give up the Dinosaurs IP.
[35:45.400 --> 35:49.280]  Wow, I bet it's more likely than one of us getting a divorce.
[35:49.760 --> 35:50.940]  I hope so!
[35:51.240 --> 35:51.600]  I don't know.
[35:53.000 --> 35:53.600]  Ridiculous.
[35:53.840 --> 35:55.160]  Still a ridiculous pick.
[35:55.640 --> 36:00.080]  But that is all of our We Know Stradamus predictions.
[36:00.580 --> 36:02.940]  Here is the board, and then we'll go to honorable mentions.
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.240]  Gavin has predicted Andrew breaks a chair,
[36:06.660 --> 36:07.880]  a new pasta shape,
[36:08.400 --> 36:10.660]  pro athlete accidentally kills a crowd member,
[36:10.940 --> 36:12.340]  and Dinosaurs reboot.
[36:13.240 --> 36:18.470]  Nick has predicted in 2025, the GTA 6 will be delayed to 2026.
[36:19.180 --> 36:21.100]  One of us will have a root canal.
[36:21.760 --> 36:24.960]  Jeff hits the average, the hot dog average.
[36:25.320 --> 36:30.300]  And then finally, there is a new world's hottest pepper, spicy.
[36:30.580 --> 36:35.940]  Andrew has predicted that in 2025,
[36:37.140 --> 36:40.900]  one of us will get a divorce and he hopes it happens too.
[36:40.900 --> 36:42.740]  Nick performs a charity.
[36:43.140 --> 36:46.120]  Number three, Arizona ice team is above 99 cents.
[36:46.220 --> 36:50.200]  And four, the hot air balloon Al Pacino incident.
[36:50.540 --> 36:50.760]  Book it.
[36:51.320 --> 36:51.700]  Okay.
[36:52.080 --> 36:54.940]  Jeff has predicted swing music is back.
[36:55.460 --> 36:56.920]  Dick Van Dyke will not die.
[36:57.500 --> 36:58.480]  A new dog breed.
[36:58.940 --> 37:00.540]  And Andrew eats the pencil.
[37:01.020 --> 37:01.360]  Gonna happen.
[37:01.620 --> 37:06.540]  And I have predicted that this year, GTA 6 will release.
[37:06.820 --> 37:07.120]  Hell yeah.
[37:07.360 --> 37:08.800]  Robbie Williams will die.
[37:09.140 --> 37:09.400]  Oh no.
[37:09.400 --> 37:11.140]  Dog will speak.
[37:11.320 --> 37:11.700]  Hell yeah.
[37:12.240 --> 37:13.760]  An oasis will break up again.
[37:14.060 --> 37:16.500]  Those are our predictions.
[37:17.260 --> 37:20.020]  But what didn't make the cut, boys?
[37:20.100 --> 37:21.320]  What are your honorable mentions?
[37:21.780 --> 37:25.720]  I was gonna put that a bat gets bird flu.
[37:26.180 --> 37:27.700]  And I thought that was probably bad news.
[37:29.280 --> 37:30.480]  I had the root canal.
[37:31.380 --> 37:32.660]  I also had the root canal.
[37:32.980 --> 37:35.720]  And then I have, yeah, I got rid of a lot of my dark ones.
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.140]  I also had AI convinces human to kill itself.
[37:39.720 --> 37:42.000]  Yeah, that'll happen for sure.
[37:42.460 --> 37:43.480]  It's probably happening right now.
[37:43.820 --> 37:46.920]  But I did indeed, at the end, go with dinosaurs reboot.
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.440]  I had, I don't know why, but I've decided the Chicago Bears are going to make the playoffs.
[37:53.440 --> 37:54.900]  That's my sports one.
[37:55.140 --> 37:56.400]  I guess maybe because of Ben Johnson.
[37:56.580 --> 38:00.640]  And then I didn't end up using this one because I thought the dog one was a little bit stronger.
[38:00.740 --> 38:04.000]  But I think in 2025, we bring an extinct animal back to life.
[38:04.280 --> 38:05.360]  Oh, that's interesting.
[38:05.540 --> 38:06.060]  I like that.
[38:06.200 --> 38:08.360]  Dinosaurs reboot, but different one.
[38:09.820 --> 38:10.600]  Alternate reboot.
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.040]  I had Warner Brothers get sold.
[38:17.540 --> 38:18.620]  Oh, yeah.
[38:18.760 --> 38:19.080]  Wow.
[38:19.380 --> 38:20.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:21.280 --> 38:27.560]  I also have Kiss reunites, but I didn't pick that because I don't think people know that they stopped.
[38:28.260 --> 38:28.440]  Yeah.
[38:28.620 --> 38:31.060]  So yeah, I was gonna that was exactly my thought.
[38:31.220 --> 38:31.440]  Yeah.
[38:31.640 --> 38:32.760]  So that's why I didn't pick it.
[38:32.820 --> 38:36.280]  I went, I don't think that anyone knows that they aren't doing anything anymore.
[38:36.500 --> 38:37.480]  That they deunited.
[38:37.480 --> 38:45.300]  Yeah, Janko jeans are back, but I'm only medium on that one.
[38:45.440 --> 38:48.540]  I think that there will be like a resurgence, but like only on TikTok.
[38:48.740 --> 38:49.760]  You'll like never see it in the wild.
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.280]  I also put Jake Paul retires from boxing, but that's part of a longer play
[38:55.800 --> 38:57.880]  that I think doesn't happen until 2027.
[38:58.320 --> 39:00.500]  So I don't think it happens this year.
[39:00.820 --> 39:04.980]  Do you think he retires from boxing and combat in general, or he moves into a different combat sport?
[39:04.980 --> 39:08.640]  Here's what I think Jake Paul does over the next three years.
[39:08.940 --> 39:11.280]  He will have one or two more fights.
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.820]  He will announce his retirement from boxing.
[39:14.260 --> 39:15.280]  He will go to rehab.
[39:15.660 --> 39:22.860]  He will become a weird Christian guy and talk about how much cocaine he was doing while he was boxing and doing all this stuff.
[39:23.020 --> 39:27.940]  And I can't suffer through the Jake Paul cocaine rehab press tour.
[39:28.140 --> 39:29.800]  I can't, I can't do it.
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.820]  I know it's coming, but I can't do it.
[39:32.120 --> 39:32.960]  Do you know what's worse than that?
[39:33.020 --> 39:34.120]  Do you know what's on the other end of that?
[39:34.440 --> 39:34.680]  What?
[39:34.680 --> 39:36.400]  He runs for some sort of public office.
[39:36.520 --> 39:37.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[39:37.800 --> 39:38.100]  Yes.
[39:38.500 --> 39:39.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:39.440 --> 39:39.740]  Uh-huh.
[39:39.840 --> 39:40.460]  A hundred percent.
[39:40.940 --> 39:46.960]  And then I also wrote down, I don't really know what this one means, but it was one that I sort of like, what could it be?
[39:47.040 --> 39:48.380]  The moon comes to us.
[39:49.600 --> 39:49.960]  Yeah.
[39:50.120 --> 39:51.420]  Like, what could that be?
[39:51.720 --> 39:58.660]  Is sort of like, that's like the intrigue was more than like the actual prediction of like, what would the, what would that mean?
[39:59.060 --> 40:00.100]  The moon is closer now?
[40:00.200 --> 40:00.520]  I don't know.
[40:00.600 --> 40:00.800]  Maybe.
[40:01.220 --> 40:05.480]  I think it could just mean that the next moon landing, they just bring a shitload of moon back.
[40:05.960 --> 40:06.560]  Could be.
[40:07.500 --> 40:08.580]  Start flogging moon.
[40:08.940 --> 40:09.160]  Yep.
[40:09.560 --> 40:10.000]  Could be.
[40:11.700 --> 40:13.520]  We got to do something with all this stuff.
[40:13.700 --> 40:14.980]  We're not doing anything with this moon.
[40:16.340 --> 40:19.340]  I think most of the moon is in Houston right now.
[40:19.580 --> 40:20.140]  Is that right?
[40:20.220 --> 40:21.680]  And we only have like a little bit, right?
[40:21.700 --> 40:23.040]  It's not like we have like a lot of moon.
[40:23.480 --> 40:25.240]  Yeah, I think the most moon is in Houston.
[40:25.720 --> 40:28.240]  Yeah, we call it Moonstone, but it's okay.
[40:28.400 --> 40:30.160]  They should brag more about that.
[40:30.800 --> 40:33.400]  Anyone have any other honorable predictions?
[40:33.800 --> 40:35.160]  Honorable mentions here?
[40:35.380 --> 40:39.280]  I only had one other one and it was, uh, it was purely selfish and purely sports.
[40:39.280 --> 40:41.620]  And it was that the Spurs would make the Western Conference finals.
[40:42.420 --> 40:44.680]  That is a way to curse yourself.
[40:45.040 --> 40:45.580]  That is insane.
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.300]  Nick, I really love that you didn't even say win the championship.
[40:50.700 --> 40:55.820]  You went like, my bold prediction is they don't even win like the Western.
[40:55.820 --> 40:57.480]  Eric, they're sub 500.
[40:57.760 --> 40:59.000]  Let them have a win.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  My prediction is they make it to the third round of the playoffs.
[41:05.820 --> 41:08.240]  They wildcard sneak their way in.
[41:11.860 --> 41:16.140]  I was originally going to have mine start vague and just get more and more specific
[41:16.140 --> 41:18.120]  until something incredibly specific happens.
[41:18.220 --> 41:21.840]  So my last one was going to be a lunatic breaks into Big Ben
[41:21.840 --> 41:26.560]  and puts a watch strap on the back and sets the world record for the biggest watch worn.
[41:26.560 --> 41:33.000]  Oh, that's a really fun one.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.200]  I cannot wait to revisit these in one year from now.
[41:38.420 --> 41:40.640]  I can wait to revisit some of them.
[41:41.720 --> 41:43.760]  No, I can't wait to prove some of these wrong.
[41:43.980 --> 41:47.960]  Yeah, I also can't wait to prove some of these wrong.
[41:48.240 --> 41:49.860]  Separated isn't divorced, Andrew.
[41:51.700 --> 41:55.080]  Yeah, divorces take a long time, I think.
[41:55.640 --> 41:56.980]  It's just couples counseling.
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.320]  I'm also going to argue that whatever Nick does is not for charity.
[42:01.820 --> 42:03.700]  What do you mean? I love people.
[42:05.100 --> 42:06.620]  I want to help people.
[42:07.500 --> 42:08.520]  Why are you laughing?
[42:11.180 --> 42:17.340]  Guys, those are our predictions. Comment with your predictions and find out if you
[42:17.340 --> 42:22.780]  are Nostradamus for the year 2025, we will revisit these in a year like a crime capsule,
[42:22.780 --> 42:25.520]  but for time. So I guess we call it a time capsule.
[42:25.780 --> 42:28.680]  We'll open it back up and see how we did in one year's time.

[42:37.760 --> 42:41.100]  Warner Brothers might get sold again, but we're still going.
[42:41.540 --> 42:44.580]  Regulation podcast lives. That's my prediction for 2025.
[42:45.100 --> 42:47.720]  Guys, thank you for listening so much, and we'll see you next time.
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.560]  Love you. Bye.
