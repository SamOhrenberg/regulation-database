[02:22.860 --> 02:25.020]  No, match one went to Jeff and Gavin.
[02:25.460 --> 02:26.880]  But okay.
[02:27.340 --> 02:28.300]  Went to Nick and Eric.
[02:28.600 --> 02:31.200]  Match three, who can say?
[02:31.380 --> 02:32.560]  We're going to have to find out.
[02:32.860 --> 02:33.780]  The question mark.
[02:34.120 --> 02:34.800]  The champion.
[02:35.020 --> 02:36.200]  We don't know, Gavin.
[02:36.440 --> 02:39.040]  We don't know who's going to win match three.
[02:41.100 --> 02:43.920]  Competitors, are we ready to begin this match?
[02:44.940 --> 02:45.140]  Yeah.
[02:45.660 --> 02:46.020]  Ready.
[02:46.160 --> 02:46.500]  It's ready.
[02:46.700 --> 02:46.860]  Ready.
[02:46.860 --> 02:47.500]  We're ready.
[02:47.780 --> 02:50.680]  Let's scroll down to the decider question.
[02:50.920 --> 02:51.460]  Oh, wait!
[02:51.700 --> 02:53.140]  This is a blindside!
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.320]  This isn't regulation!
[02:56.780 --> 02:59.400]  How many blindsides do you get in a year?
[02:59.820 --> 03:02.720]  I get one podcast blindside.
[03:02.820 --> 03:03.680]  No, this is...
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.840]  And I'm taking advantage.
[03:08.060 --> 03:10.280]  We're running out of time for the end of this year.
[03:10.840 --> 03:12.140]  I'm taking advantage of mine.
[03:12.340 --> 03:12.900]  We're going to watch...
[03:12.900 --> 03:18.100]  Listen, on the old podcast, we had HIV AIDS blindside.
[03:18.260 --> 03:20.640]  We haven't had one in this current era.
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.280]  So I want to take us in, educate the people on an important issue.
[03:25.320 --> 03:26.540]  Stop blindsiding us with AIDS!
[03:26.860 --> 03:29.220]  No, listen, this is my first time doing it.
[03:29.740 --> 03:31.700]  It's a... listen, it's a great PSA.
[03:31.980 --> 03:33.880]  We're going to watch this whole thing?
[03:34.260 --> 03:35.460]  Yep, we're watching it.
[03:37.260 --> 03:40.440]  So was feud a real thing at all?
[03:40.480 --> 03:40.760]  Yes.
[03:41.040 --> 03:41.260]  Okay.
[03:41.940 --> 03:42.740]  Was it a tie then?
[03:43.220 --> 03:44.200]  Yeah, I guess we tied.
[03:44.860 --> 03:45.640]  No, we won.
[03:45.700 --> 03:46.780]  No, there'll be a part three.
[03:48.260 --> 03:50.820]  Oh, I mean, I don't believe that, but okay.
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.000]  Andrew, you can give us a test on questions from this PSA and we'll see who does the best.
[03:58.420 --> 03:59.420]  Listen, this won nothing.
[04:00.580 --> 04:03.140]  Much like it was going into game two of Regulation Feud.
[04:06.730 --> 04:08.270]  I say Ajal was a funny dude.
[04:09.130 --> 04:10.650]  He is a 90s funny dude.
[04:10.970 --> 04:12.050]  Do you guys ever see White Knights?
[04:12.930 --> 04:13.290]  No.
[04:13.290 --> 04:16.030]  Dude, he's fucking hilarious in White Knights.
[04:16.390 --> 04:17.950]  I don't even know what White Knights is.
[04:17.950 --> 04:18.570]  Is it a sitcom?
[04:18.810 --> 04:19.430]  What is White Knights?
[04:19.590 --> 04:20.830]  No, it was Eddie Murphy.
[04:21.690 --> 04:24.090]  It was Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall movie.
[04:24.630 --> 04:26.410]  Oh, did they dress up as a bunch of characters?
[04:26.690 --> 04:28.310]  Also had Richard Pryor in it.
[04:28.490 --> 04:33.430]  No, they played like, they played like, like low, like a Harlem mafia.
[04:33.450 --> 04:36.750]  And then they were getting pushed on by a bunch of white dudes and cops.
[04:36.750 --> 04:39.030]  And then they had to like, it was kind of like the sting in Harlem.
[04:39.650 --> 04:40.810]  Oh, time out.
[04:41.450 --> 04:45.770]  I don't know if y'all noticed this, but all of Arsenio Hall's clothes have tags on them.
[04:45.870 --> 04:47.090]  I think they're returning them after this.
[04:48.850 --> 04:49.890]  That's awesome.
[04:53.140 --> 04:54.560]  Cool of Arsenio Hall.
[04:57.060 --> 04:58.700]  Oh, this is celebrity filled.
[05:00.480 --> 05:01.000]  Really?
[05:01.620 --> 05:02.200]  Oh, yeah.
[05:03.440 --> 05:05.400]  He almost got Misconceptions out perfectly.
[05:06.580 --> 05:08.220]  Yeah, as you...
[05:08.220 --> 05:08.880]  Oh my God.
[05:08.880 --> 05:14.480]  As you would see through Magic Johnson's career as a broadcaster, etc.
[05:14.800 --> 05:16.060]  It's not his strong suit.
[05:16.160 --> 05:18.200]  His strong suit was playing the game of basketball.
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.960]  You didn't like him in the front office for the Lakers?
[05:22.240 --> 05:26.080]  I didn't like him in anything except playing the game of basketball.
[05:27.600 --> 05:30.400]  Do you think Mr. Belvedere explained AIDS to Pauly Shore as well?
[05:31.200 --> 05:35.420]  Dude, Pauly Shore is one of those people that's never going to die.
[05:35.420 --> 05:40.740]  He's going to be like 104 and we'll still be hearing about his every year on his birthday.
[05:44.970 --> 05:46.230]  Is Mitzi still around?
[05:47.090 --> 05:48.470]  No, she died.
[05:48.590 --> 05:48.890]  She died.
[05:53.510 --> 05:57.530]  I'm sorry, are they just putting microphones in people's faces at the mall and going,
[05:57.650 --> 05:58.910]  do you know what AIDS is?
[05:58.930 --> 05:59.890]  Yes, yes, they are.
[06:00.210 --> 06:01.610]  This is before the mall left.
[06:02.950 --> 06:05.030]  This is the height of the mall, dude.
[06:05.130 --> 06:06.390]  This is peak mall.
[06:06.530 --> 06:08.290]  This is where you go when you want to talk to people.
[06:08.290 --> 06:13.630]  Hey, hey, if I was at the mall and Pauly Shore walked up to me with a microphone,
[06:13.730 --> 06:16.010]  he just went, hey, you know what AIDS is, buddy?
[06:16.710 --> 06:17.670]  I'd hightail it.
[06:18.130 --> 06:20.250]  This is where the idea for Impractical Jokers came from.
[06:20.910 --> 06:22.610]  I love that he chased them into the store.
[06:22.730 --> 06:24.030]  He's in the back rooms of the mall.
[06:26.690 --> 06:30.210]  Also, just the idea that you would think that Pauly Shore was doing this in earnest.
[06:30.510 --> 06:33.730]  This is an educational thing.
[06:35.170 --> 06:38.170]  You never assume Pauly Shore was doing this not as a bit.
[06:39.350 --> 06:41.150]  And so people know I can't hear what anyone's saying.
[06:41.250 --> 06:42.370]  Are they saying they don't know what it is?
[06:42.710 --> 06:44.350]  No, they all seem pretty well informed.
[06:44.810 --> 06:45.070]  Oh.
[06:47.530 --> 06:48.710]  Turn up your stream volume.
[06:49.930 --> 06:51.030]  Oh, that's a good point.
[06:55.530 --> 06:57.850]  I have mine lower because I don't want to fucking hear it.
[07:00.410 --> 07:01.430]  Eric's anti-AIDS.
[07:01.890 --> 07:04.070]  Yeah, yeah, and Jeff is pro-AIDS.
[07:05.490 --> 07:07.030]  I'm pro talking about it.
[07:08.070 --> 07:09.870]  Who refuses to wear the ribbon, Jeff?
[07:10.710 --> 07:11.230]  What?
[07:12.050 --> 07:13.190]  It's a Seinfeld reference.
[07:19.890 --> 07:21.410]  I really got you.
[07:22.230 --> 07:23.970]  It's just quite explicit.
[07:24.470 --> 07:25.050]  Yeah, did you know?
[07:25.110 --> 07:25.750]  I'm looking it up.
[07:25.870 --> 07:27.970]  There are now seven patients who've been curative.
[07:28.410 --> 07:29.630]  Hey, is that right?
[07:29.850 --> 07:30.110]  Yeah.
[07:30.530 --> 07:30.730]  Wow.
[07:31.150 --> 07:31.570]  Really?
[07:31.790 --> 07:31.970]  Wow.
[07:33.210 --> 07:34.890]  This is so nice.
[07:35.010 --> 07:39.550]  The backdrop, the like the font, like everything.
[07:40.690 --> 07:41.810]  Oh, no.
[07:43.370 --> 07:46.290]  This is the most scatterbrained piece of content.
[07:47.890 --> 07:56.230]  It this it feels like it's made by people who go, well, we have to keep it like moving.
[07:56.350 --> 07:58.310]  Otherwise, the kids won't pay attention to it.
[07:58.330 --> 08:02.130]  And you end up with like insane media.
[08:02.490 --> 08:03.770]  It will not slow down.
[08:03.810 --> 08:04.670]  It will not stop.
[08:05.310 --> 08:07.490]  This is how you had to talk to us back then.
[08:07.490 --> 08:09.890]  This is the only way we can receive information.
[08:16.800 --> 08:18.520]  I don't know who wrote this.
[08:19.680 --> 08:20.640]  It's a great question.
[08:20.760 --> 08:22.460]  This is a Jaleel White original right here.
[08:23.360 --> 08:25.180]  Like this had to be this was directed and produced.
[08:27.540 --> 08:28.640]  What is this called, Andrew?
[08:29.520 --> 08:30.140]  A time out.
[08:44.140 --> 08:47.020]  You guys will never you guys will never guess who directed it.
[08:48.000 --> 08:48.700]  Wilford Brimley.
[08:49.120 --> 08:49.780]  Christopher Nolan.
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.460]  I was about to say Nolan.
[08:51.680 --> 08:54.100]  I bet it's Rob Reiner.
[08:55.020 --> 08:56.320]  Malcolm Jamal Warner.
[08:58.060 --> 08:59.260]  I don't know who that is.
[08:59.360 --> 08:59.600]  Who's that?
[09:00.180 --> 09:01.100]  Malcolm Jamal Warner.
[09:01.480 --> 09:03.800]  He was the older brother on Cosby Show.
[09:04.980 --> 09:05.900]  Oh, no way.
[09:06.780 --> 09:08.220]  He also did Friday Night Videos.
[09:08.400 --> 09:09.320]  Oh, that was him.
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.600]  He was just there.
[09:11.060 --> 09:11.880]  Theo Huxtable?
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.080]  Yeah, Theo Huxtable.
[09:13.300 --> 09:14.100]  That's Malcolm Jamal Warner.
[09:16.040 --> 09:19.640]  Oh, it's the woman that was arguing with dad on Usher.
[09:19.780 --> 09:20.140]  Yeah.
[09:23.020 --> 09:23.900]  Wait, what?
[09:27.680 --> 09:34.800]  The writer was a guy named Thad Mumford, who died in 2018, and he wrote for
[09:35.700 --> 09:40.900]  MASH and The Electric Company and A Different World.
[09:44.200 --> 09:45.400]  Sesame Street.
[09:45.820 --> 09:47.720]  Definitely encouraged Arsenio.
[09:47.720 --> 09:50.840]  We got Urkel rapping about his dick exploding.
[09:50.940 --> 09:53.180]  I think we're going to get it.
[09:53.220 --> 09:54.060]  People are going to get this.
[09:54.580 --> 09:55.040]  Keep going.
[09:55.140 --> 09:55.780]  Never stop moving.
[09:55.880 --> 09:56.660]  Centerville, Ojai.
[09:56.820 --> 09:58.240]  This, I love this font.
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.120]  I want this to be how Regulation Podcast looks.
[10:01.480 --> 10:03.500]  I want the font flying everywhere.
[10:03.740 --> 10:09.120]  I want some of it to be in capital letters and some of it to be in big fat fucking lowercase
[10:09.120 --> 10:09.460]  letters.
[10:09.820 --> 10:12.320]  It is kind of how it looks in my brain when we're doing it.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.400]  Did Magic Johnson have a talk show?
[10:17.720 --> 10:19.300]  Yeah, not very long, but he did.
[10:19.440 --> 10:19.600]  Nope.
[10:19.920 --> 10:21.020]  It was a late night show, wasn't it?
[10:21.240 --> 10:21.380]  Yeah.
[10:21.920 --> 10:22.340]  Yeah.
[10:22.980 --> 10:24.340]  I think he lasted one season.
[10:24.540 --> 10:27.060]  Again, he's good at playing basketball.
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.760]  Magic Johnson was from an era of... he was really from, I would say, the last era of
[10:32.760 --> 10:38.720]  athletes who weren't media trained and weren't, like, also necessarily personalities.
[10:39.080 --> 10:40.440]  Like Michael Jordan, same way.
[10:40.820 --> 10:44.920]  Most amazing basketball player of all time, but kind of wooden in front of the camera,
[10:45.080 --> 10:45.420]  you know?
[10:45.980 --> 10:51.220]  And we're spoiled by the Chris Pauls and the Blake Griffins and the LeBron Jameses and
[10:51.220 --> 10:53.300]  the Patrick Mahomeses of the world now.
[10:53.440 --> 10:55.180]  It wasn't like that back in the day.
[10:55.640 --> 10:58.160]  We had Charles Barkley and Shaq, you know?
[10:58.300 --> 11:04.280]  Well, that's why Magic Johnson was such a, like, wow, like, this guy can dribble a basketball
[11:04.280 --> 11:07.120]  and he's smiling in a sort of affable?
[11:07.620 --> 11:12.080]  That went such a long way in the 1980s when no one else was doing it.
[11:12.080 --> 11:15.480]  He's easily one of the most likable players from that era.
[11:16.120 --> 11:18.840]  And compare him to, like, you know, one of my favorite players, Larry Bird.
[11:19.260 --> 11:22.200]  There's a reason you don't see Larry Bird in anything ever.
[11:22.680 --> 11:22.800]  Yeah.
[11:23.140 --> 11:24.020]  He was kind of a dick.
[11:24.260 --> 11:29.280]  Kind of a dick and not super likable or personable in front of a camera, you know?
[11:30.860 --> 11:32.200]  Now everyone's media trained.
[11:32.240 --> 11:32.600]  It's different.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.280]  But just live in a world where you're, you know, on camera 24 hours a day, no matter
[11:40.280 --> 11:40.760]  where you are.
[11:40.760 --> 11:41.260]  Yeah.
[11:43.660 --> 11:46.620]  That guy is not having a great time at the table.
[11:46.940 --> 11:49.060]  He regrets signing up for this.
[11:49.200 --> 11:49.660]  A hundred percent.
[11:49.740 --> 11:50.700]  That guy's mean right now, dude.
[11:50.780 --> 11:51.820]  He can't get out easily.
[11:52.220 --> 11:52.400]  Yep.
[11:54.520 --> 11:56.500]  I'm seeing myself in meetings.
[11:59.580 --> 12:04.760]  It's kind of interesting, though, because we saw, like, how they introduced aides to
[12:04.760 --> 12:07.180]  kids in the 80s through Mr. Belvedere.
[12:07.500 --> 12:10.380]  And now you're seeing, like, the next generation, how they tackle it.
[12:10.380 --> 12:10.820]  Yeah.
[12:11.460 --> 12:12.500]  This is how I remember.
[12:12.600 --> 12:13.860]  Way more informative, by the way.
[12:14.180 --> 12:19.180]  Not necessarily this video, but I remember learning about it.
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.860]  And it was very much in this tone of, like, we're pretty street, but also vaginal fluids.
[12:26.180 --> 12:30.880]  This came out when I was in 11th grade, so I probably didn't have to watch it in class.
[12:30.900 --> 12:34.260]  But I bet if I was, like, in ninth grade, I would have had to that year.
[12:34.980 --> 12:38.380]  I mean, if they tried to play in class, you would protest it because of Magic Johnson.
[12:38.380 --> 12:40.560]  I assume as a Celtics fan, you would not allow this.
[12:41.560 --> 12:43.960]  What's the difference between blood and blood products?
[12:44.120 --> 12:44.360]  Dad!
[12:46.860 --> 12:47.520]  He is.
[12:47.640 --> 12:49.520]  But his son is a professional wrestler.
[12:50.300 --> 12:50.580]  Really?
[12:50.880 --> 12:54.840]  Yeah, he's Jack Perry in AEW.
[12:55.300 --> 12:56.780]  He's the current TNT champion.
[12:57.000 --> 12:57.720]  That was a sad one.
[12:57.900 --> 12:58.900]  I liked him, Luke Perry.
[12:59.160 --> 12:59.620]  Yeah.
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.760]  It was in the fifth element.
[13:02.820 --> 13:03.420]  Was he?
[13:03.820 --> 13:04.540]  It was?
[13:04.780 --> 13:04.980]  Yeah.
[13:05.660 --> 13:06.700]  Where was he in the fifth element?
[13:06.840 --> 13:07.420]  I don't remember that.
[13:08.380 --> 13:08.860]  At the beginning.
[13:12.940 --> 13:15.740]  Just... he wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't true.
[13:16.400 --> 13:17.540]  He always gets you with this bullshit.
[13:18.360 --> 13:18.960]  It's not bullshit.
[13:19.140 --> 13:20.680]  It's just the start of the movie.
[13:22.460 --> 13:24.980]  Was he, like, the priest assistant dude?
[13:25.360 --> 13:25.900]  What the...
[13:25.900 --> 13:27.720]  He was the Aziz Lai assistant.
[13:31.600 --> 13:32.040]  Okay.
[13:34.040 --> 13:34.480]  Okay.
[13:36.440 --> 13:39.700]  Is this Cosby Show stuff or something?
[13:41.380 --> 13:42.220]  It could be.
[13:42.440 --> 13:42.800]  92.
[13:42.960 --> 13:44.200]  Probably a different world, maybe.
[13:45.720 --> 13:47.120]  Oh, is Dwayne Wade in this?
[13:48.340 --> 13:49.580]  I want to see him slip up his sunglasses.
[13:53.920 --> 13:54.640]  Oh, shit.
[13:54.760 --> 13:55.780]  Oh, it's this guy.
[14:00.500 --> 14:01.620]  He's on SNL, right?
[14:02.240 --> 14:03.060]  I don't think so.
[14:03.100 --> 14:03.960]  I don't think he was ever on SNL.
[14:04.020 --> 14:04.740]  Is that Paul Rodriguez?
[14:04.920 --> 14:05.340]  Is that his name?
[14:05.600 --> 14:06.560]  I think so.
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.340]  He was very much like an 80s, 90s comedian.
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.160]  Paul Rodriguez.
[14:14.800 --> 14:16.900]  The thing they're watching isn't black and white, is it?
[14:16.920 --> 14:17.600]  Oh, okay, it is.
[14:21.450 --> 14:22.570]  Oh, that's What's-Her-Face.
[14:24.150 --> 14:25.070]  From a different world.
[14:25.430 --> 14:25.490]  Yeah.
[14:25.590 --> 14:26.150]  She's from a different world.
[14:26.450 --> 14:27.230]  And that's Dwayne Wade.
[14:28.510 --> 14:29.570]  He's got his...
[14:29.570 --> 14:30.850]  He just doesn't have his sunglasses on.
[14:31.130 --> 14:32.210]  Yeah, he's got his cool guy.
[14:32.830 --> 14:33.190]  Boo!
[14:33.770 --> 14:34.670]  Put on your sunglasses!
[14:35.030 --> 14:35.210]  Boo!
[14:36.390 --> 14:37.890]  Do you think we can make regulation?
[14:38.090 --> 14:39.490]  Oh, we should make those sunglasses!
[14:40.090 --> 14:41.750]  And then they would have the logo on them.
[14:42.530 --> 14:44.150]  Oh, this is such a good idea!
[14:45.290 --> 14:48.990]  You know, I think she was also in White Nights, if I remember correctly.
[14:50.090 --> 14:51.610]  There's a lot of White Nights connections.
[14:51.670 --> 14:52.810]  Dude, we gotta watch that movie.
[14:52.870 --> 14:53.750]  That should be a watch-along.
[14:53.970 --> 14:55.010]  Is that gonna be your blindside?
[14:55.230 --> 14:56.470]  Funny, dirty movie.
[14:59.590 --> 15:01.730]  What do you think the first thing was that didn't hold up?
[15:04.290 --> 15:05.110]  Oh, man.
[15:05.530 --> 15:06.110]  Oh, boy.
[15:06.370 --> 15:06.710]  That a sex joke?
[15:08.050 --> 15:08.450]  Nah.
[15:14.970 --> 15:18.030]  Like, do you think someone in the 60s was watching Gone with the Wind and it's like,
[15:18.190 --> 15:19.250]  this didn't hold up?
[15:19.750 --> 15:20.670]  Yeah, I'm trying to...
[15:21.170 --> 15:25.330]  Think about these sunglasses, right, that I'm dropping in the chat.
[15:25.930 --> 15:26.810]  Look at those sunglasses.
[15:27.110 --> 15:31.450]  Imagine if we had those, but we had the show logo, the asterisk, over the eyes.
[15:31.450 --> 15:33.150]  So you pulled them down and then you couldn't see?
[15:33.410 --> 15:34.230]  Well, no, you could see.
[15:34.250 --> 15:35.750]  You could just see right through them, but...
[15:35.750 --> 15:35.890]  Oh.
[15:36.410 --> 15:36.670]  Yeah.
[15:37.750 --> 15:40.030]  Damn, I think that's such a good idea.
[15:40.530 --> 15:41.590]  Those are pretty cool sunglasses.
[15:42.150 --> 15:42.470]  Right?
[15:51.900 --> 15:53.280]  You tell him, Paul Rodriguez.
[15:54.320 --> 15:57.220]  Thrifty has a sale on condoms?
[15:57.580 --> 15:59.160]  Don't buy for sale condoms.
[15:59.460 --> 16:02.140]  What about his most famous movie was?
[16:02.360 --> 16:04.680]  Oh, Born in East LA.
[16:04.680 --> 16:05.960]  Born in East LA, it's gotta be.
[16:07.560 --> 16:08.120]  That's right.
[16:08.460 --> 16:10.360]  I'm using Quicksilver, made in America.
[16:11.420 --> 16:13.080]  Oh, DC Cab, Jesus Christ.
[16:13.600 --> 16:18.680]  Do you think a lot of Gen Z or the new one knows what that white noise is?
[16:19.520 --> 16:20.760]  The new ones.
[16:20.920 --> 16:21.320]  The new one.
[16:21.460 --> 16:21.620]  Alpha.
[16:22.480 --> 16:22.660]  Yeah.
[16:22.720 --> 16:23.260]  Yeah, they're alpha.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.140]  Is that what your kid is?
[16:25.820 --> 16:26.640]  Yeah, he's alpha.
[16:27.020 --> 16:28.840]  Go ask him if he knows what static is.
[16:29.120 --> 16:30.200]  Your kid is red versus blue?
[16:35.640 --> 16:36.560]  Oh, man.
[16:39.120 --> 16:39.520]  Yeah.
[16:43.040 --> 16:43.840]  Fucking Sinbad.
[16:43.860 --> 16:44.840]  A little Sinbad.
[16:45.320 --> 16:46.340]  Johnny headed Sinbad.
[16:47.480 --> 16:47.880]  Damn.
[16:50.800 --> 16:52.520]  There's a hole in that condom.
[16:53.820 --> 16:54.700]  Oh, no.
[16:56.960 --> 16:59.300]  It would be a lot better if it was just like...
[17:00.020 --> 17:02.620]  I have no idea what it is.
[17:03.060 --> 17:05.240]  It just says Sinbad across it.
[17:07.280 --> 17:08.640]  Trust me, it's Sinbad.
[17:10.900 --> 17:14.940]  I don't know where he is in America right now or in the world and what he's doing,
[17:14.980 --> 17:17.440]  but I guarantee you somebody's laughing right now.
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.000]  He's a funny dude.
[17:19.100 --> 17:19.240]  He's great.
[17:19.480 --> 17:20.380]  He's very funny.
[17:25.610 --> 17:28.370]  Spermicidally lubricated sounds like one of Gavin's worm schemes.
[17:31.210 --> 17:32.730]  Do you think they'd censor it or no?
[17:33.370 --> 17:33.970]  Oh, yeah.
[17:46.740 --> 17:47.960]  Call me condom.
[17:50.340 --> 17:52.020]  Go get the goatskin, get the latex.
[17:52.260 --> 17:53.220]  Is he in a straight jacket?
[17:58.030 --> 17:58.710]  Ain't gonna happen.
[17:58.710 --> 17:59.480]  Yeah, that is a great...
[18:02.430 --> 18:03.960]  He's definitely in like some...
[18:04.960 --> 18:05.360]  Crap.
[18:05.560 --> 18:09.640]  I think he's in a sheet that's probably wrapped around the back and tied.
[18:10.320 --> 18:11.140]  That makes sense.
[18:17.270 --> 18:20.130]  Is this the only collaboration between Tom Cruise and Sinbad?
[18:20.810 --> 18:22.010]  Is Tom Cruise in this?
[18:22.130 --> 18:22.310]  Wow.
[18:22.710 --> 18:23.510]  We already saw him.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.330]  We went past him.
[18:24.530 --> 18:24.990]  Yeah, we already saw him.
[18:24.990 --> 18:25.430]  Oh, did we?
[18:25.650 --> 18:26.550]  Where did we see Tom Cruise?
[18:27.090 --> 18:27.710]  Just for a minute.
[18:27.950 --> 18:29.130]  He was just talking to the camera.
[18:29.130 --> 18:31.510]  He was very intensely talking about having sex.
[18:32.030 --> 18:32.970]  Oh, I might have Googled.
[18:33.010 --> 18:34.090]  I might have been Googling something else.
[18:36.810 --> 18:38.010]  Probably looking at Paul Rodriguez.
[18:46.490 --> 18:48.130]  Why is it long?
[18:48.910 --> 18:50.350]  Why is it like that?
[18:50.370 --> 18:51.150]  What the fuck?
[18:51.470 --> 18:52.670]  Did they used to be shaped long?
[18:53.590 --> 18:55.130]  They used to have condoms like that.
[18:55.450 --> 18:55.750]  Really?
[18:55.950 --> 18:56.610]  They probably still do.
[18:57.490 --> 18:58.610]  A needle condom?
[18:58.790 --> 18:59.190]  What is that?
[18:59.310 --> 18:59.830]  How do you...
[18:59.830 --> 19:01.030]  Is it for like oval dicks?
[19:01.710 --> 19:02.690]  Nah, they're just like...
[19:02.690 --> 19:03.890]  It's just like smushed.
[19:04.050 --> 19:05.670]  You pop it out, it'll just go to the normal size.
[19:09.030 --> 19:10.810]  All right, there's a penis right there.
[19:13.570 --> 19:16.230]  The idea that that lady is like,
[19:16.410 --> 19:18.470]  yeah, I was in a movie once with Tom Cruise,
[19:18.610 --> 19:20.150]  I was in the Hall of Magic Johnson.
[19:21.050 --> 19:22.150]  What was your role?
[19:22.990 --> 19:25.310]  I held up a fake dick with my fingers.
[19:25.970 --> 19:27.330]  I don't want to talk about it.
[19:29.510 --> 19:32.230]  If this condom pops out and becomes normal shaped,
[19:32.350 --> 19:33.250]  I think it's going to blow my mind.
[19:39.470 --> 19:40.630]  Just like that, it's normal.
[19:40.770 --> 19:41.450]  Just like that.
[19:42.110 --> 19:42.230]  Wow.
[19:42.850 --> 19:43.970]  Yeah, they're pretty bendable.
[19:45.210 --> 19:46.390]  Maybe it causes a weakness.
[19:49.310 --> 19:49.810]  Uh.
[19:52.670 --> 19:53.670]  Be a better penis.
[19:53.870 --> 19:54.130]  I move.
[19:55.070 --> 19:55.930]  As you do.
[19:56.570 --> 19:57.530]  Wow, that's lopsided.
[19:57.870 --> 19:58.530]  Oh, man.
[19:59.710 --> 20:01.650]  And then pull it up a little bit,
[20:01.790 --> 20:03.570]  tie it in a knot at the end and...
[20:04.890 --> 20:05.870]  And then...
[20:05.870 --> 20:06.210]  Pull it over.
[20:06.230 --> 20:06.910]  Tie it off again.
[20:07.150 --> 20:09.370]  Okay, so then pull the bottom part down far,
[20:09.510 --> 20:11.950]  stuff the balls in and then get to business.
[20:13.490 --> 20:15.850]  You think Arsenio Hall's condoms have tags on them?
[20:17.270 --> 20:18.870]  Yeah, he's going to return them.
[20:24.030 --> 20:26.970]  Has someone ever got pregnant from condom spillage?
[20:28.150 --> 20:29.290]  Oh, I don't doubt it.
[20:29.390 --> 20:30.710]  Yeah, I don't doubt that.
[20:30.870 --> 20:32.410]  Like a bunch of NBA players, right?
[20:32.930 --> 20:33.250]  Yep.
[20:34.650 --> 20:35.010]  Paula.
[20:40.740 --> 20:42.360]  Well, check this out.
[20:42.860 --> 20:48.200]  It's so good for her to have a career built on whatever it is she did.
[20:49.520 --> 20:50.240]  She said...
[20:50.240 --> 20:50.620]  Come on, dude.
[20:50.640 --> 20:52.260]  She sang with the MC Skat Kat.
[20:52.540 --> 20:52.940]  She did.
[20:53.080 --> 20:54.420]  She was a Laker girl.
[20:54.600 --> 20:55.520]  She sang with the Kat.
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.040]  She had Keanu Reeves in her music video.
[20:58.220 --> 20:58.780]  She was huge.
[20:59.220 --> 20:59.940]  American Idol.
[21:00.260 --> 21:01.820]  She was for a minute and then American Idol.
[21:02.060 --> 21:03.160]  And that was like the resurgence.
[21:03.460 --> 21:04.280]  Friends with Simon Cowell.
[21:05.940 --> 21:08.640]  With her being a Laker girl and this being a Magic Johnson thing,
[21:08.680 --> 21:11.780]  I feel like you can probably tie Magic Johnson to all these people in some way.
[21:11.840 --> 21:16.400]  I think when you said this seems like a thing that people needed to like call in favors for,
[21:16.520 --> 21:17.540]  it was Magic Johnson going,
[21:17.540 --> 21:18.360]  I'm doing this.
[21:18.460 --> 21:19.160]  You're doing this.
[21:20.100 --> 21:21.480]  Hey, that guy's Glenn.
[21:24.500 --> 21:25.660]  Friends with Magic Johnson.
[21:32.770 --> 21:33.290]  What?
[21:33.470 --> 21:33.830]  Jesus.
[21:40.550 --> 21:41.070]  What?
[21:42.610 --> 21:44.290]  We're talking about cats.
[21:45.550 --> 21:46.970]  So are the cats OK?
[21:47.090 --> 21:48.030]  Or where did the cats go?
[21:48.030 --> 21:49.030]  What did the cats have to do with the dogs?
[21:50.150 --> 21:52.350]  Did you guys grow up scared of AIDS?
[21:53.150 --> 21:53.470]  No.
[21:53.870 --> 21:54.050]  No.
[21:54.290 --> 21:54.790]  Yes.
[21:55.430 --> 21:56.630]  A little, yeah.
[21:57.010 --> 21:58.290]  I think it must be my generation.
[21:58.430 --> 21:59.570]  I was fucking terrified.
[21:59.750 --> 22:02.290]  I was like 18 when kids came out and that was it.
[22:02.350 --> 22:02.770]  It was over.
[22:02.830 --> 22:04.610]  I never wanted to have sex again after that.
[22:05.330 --> 22:06.570]  Again, big quotes.
[22:06.990 --> 22:10.410]  It was just among the sexually transmitted stuff to be scared of.
[22:10.710 --> 22:11.230]  Yes, exactly.
[22:11.450 --> 22:13.150]  It was never specifically AIDS for me.
[22:13.410 --> 22:15.110]  Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
[22:15.170 --> 22:15.370]  Yes.
[22:15.870 --> 22:20.590]  For me, it was every other STI can fuck your month up.
[22:20.890 --> 22:21.530]  AIDS will kill you.
[22:23.190 --> 22:26.810]  Yeah, it was bigger in the 90s when I was younger.
[22:26.810 --> 22:29.830]  And then as I got older, it seemed to kind of fade to the...
[22:29.830 --> 22:31.750]  Were you still learning about this stuff when you were older?
[22:33.410 --> 22:37.330]  Yeah, Nick only just learned about this stuff like a week or two ago, I think.
[22:37.430 --> 22:39.090]  Why do you think I set this up, Gavin?
[22:39.630 --> 22:40.550]  What is this, October?
[22:40.570 --> 22:42.370]  You still need to learn about this in like July.
[22:42.930 --> 22:44.230]  This is Nick's intervention.
[22:44.910 --> 22:45.430]  Oh no.
[22:45.990 --> 22:48.450]  Oh, it's blindside.
[22:48.550 --> 22:49.230]  Isn't this crazy?
[22:49.330 --> 22:50.410]  So we're going to sit down and learn.
[22:52.410 --> 22:54.530]  It's a birds and the bees blindside.
[22:54.970 --> 22:56.610]  Oh no, Archie, where'd you come from?
[22:59.830 --> 23:01.210]  I think I have to have a chat.
[23:01.450 --> 23:03.410]  I went to high school with a girl who didn't know how she got pregnant.
[23:04.530 --> 23:05.170]  That's crazy.
[23:05.770 --> 23:07.750]  She said on a toilet seat funny or something?
[23:08.230 --> 23:09.790]  Somebody explained it to her eventually, I think.
[23:09.950 --> 23:10.150]  But yeah.
[23:10.210 --> 23:11.930]  Is it just one of those things where it's like,
[23:11.970 --> 23:13.510]  we can't get pregnant the first time you have sex?
[23:13.830 --> 23:14.630]  Yeah, I think so.
[23:14.730 --> 23:15.030]  Is that right?
[23:15.190 --> 23:15.350]  Okay.
[23:15.450 --> 23:16.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[23:16.490 --> 23:16.630]  Right.
[23:16.790 --> 23:18.850]  Some people give birth without realizing they're pregnant.
[23:20.210 --> 23:21.070]  Oh, that... yeah.
[23:21.490 --> 23:21.690]  Yeah.
[23:22.390 --> 23:25.470]  Hey, Gavin, do you think Deckard was a replicant?
[23:29.190 --> 23:31.290]  Uh, don't they just straight up tell you in the second one?
[23:32.570 --> 23:33.350]  I don't want to.
[23:33.470 --> 23:37.050]  I don't want to bring in, you know, canon that's past the original movie.
[23:37.130 --> 23:37.510]  I just...
[23:37.510 --> 23:38.930]  I mean, it's it's canon, though.
[23:39.790 --> 23:40.110]  Right.
[23:40.350 --> 23:41.770]  Let's say the second movie didn't happen.
[23:41.810 --> 23:42.170]  What do you think?
[23:42.210 --> 23:43.690]  Yeah, that that's what I'm talking about.
[23:45.650 --> 23:46.590]  Yeah, of course.
[23:48.570 --> 23:49.650]  I'm just asking, guys.
[23:49.670 --> 23:50.870]  You don't have to be mad at me about it.
[23:52.710 --> 23:53.490]  Oh, my God.
[23:53.690 --> 23:53.830]  Whoa.
[23:53.910 --> 23:54.530]  Oh, wow.
[23:55.610 --> 23:57.010]  Pre-Starship Troopers.
[23:57.290 --> 23:59.810]  Yeah, this is... this is a dookie right here.
[24:01.890 --> 24:02.710]  Oh, they got a doctor.
[24:03.450 --> 24:07.170]  That dude was... that dude was so cool when I was growing up.
[24:08.010 --> 24:10.730]  He... and then when I was growing up, he wasn't.
[24:11.130 --> 24:11.710]  Yeah, right.
[24:11.750 --> 24:12.190]  It flipped.
[24:12.270 --> 24:16.070]  But he made every kid my age feel like they could be smart and a grown up.
[24:16.290 --> 24:21.210]  Uh, and then, like, no career in the 90s, except he did Starship Troopers.
[24:21.310 --> 24:23.790]  And then all of a sudden, gigantic resurgence.
[24:23.790 --> 24:24.910]  Dr. Horrible.
[24:25.050 --> 24:26.470]  I think is what did it.
[24:27.430 --> 24:28.850]  How I met your mother.
[24:29.070 --> 24:29.890]  Was it that or how I met your mother?
[24:29.910 --> 24:30.490]  Yeah, gigantic.
[24:30.990 --> 24:31.490]  Harold and Kumar.
[24:32.470 --> 24:33.030]  Oh, yeah.
[24:33.050 --> 24:34.650]  That was, like, the really big thing, huh?
[24:34.890 --> 24:35.930]  Him being in Harold and Kumar.
[24:37.170 --> 24:38.430]  Wasn't he a dick in that or something?
[24:38.430 --> 24:40.850]  Yeah, because it was, like, him playing, like, against type.
[24:40.890 --> 24:42.150]  And people are like, this is so funny.
[24:44.550 --> 24:47.930]  If you ever hadn't seen Don't Trust the B in Apartment 23,
[24:49.630 --> 24:51.110]  what's his name from Dawson's Creek?
[24:51.210 --> 24:51.910]  Plays that version.
[24:51.910 --> 24:52.870]  Oh, James Van Der Beek.
[24:52.870 --> 24:57.610]  He plays, like, a very, like, counter character.
[24:58.230 --> 24:59.770]  Like, his real self.
[25:00.070 --> 25:01.010]  But he's a dick.
[25:01.470 --> 25:03.050]  And he's just, like, a self-entitled asshole.
[25:03.190 --> 25:04.030]  Nick, I got news for you.
[25:04.150 --> 25:07.930]  I did an event with him once where he was, like, one of the hosts.
[25:08.190 --> 25:10.310]  He plays that role everywhere, I think.
[25:11.790 --> 25:12.510]  Oh, no!
[25:13.330 --> 25:14.450]  He's typecast himself.
[25:14.510 --> 25:16.630]  Wow, what a great actor this guy is.
[25:16.870 --> 25:18.250]  Yes, I'm acting.
[25:19.530 --> 25:22.670]  I was like, get me the fuck away from this whole scene.
[25:23.350 --> 25:24.270]  Oh, man.
[25:26.390 --> 25:30.090]  You think when you're editing something like this, do you go, like,
[25:30.450 --> 25:37.210]  do we put the Urkel dick rap before the serious people talking about their experience?
[25:37.330 --> 25:38.370]  Or do we do it after?
[25:39.170 --> 25:41.470]  Where does Sinbad fit in all of this?
[25:41.610 --> 25:45.430]  These are decisions Malcolm Jamal Warner handled and handled artfully.
[25:47.410 --> 25:49.470]  Was it Friday Night Videos he did, right?
[25:50.690 --> 25:51.810]  I don't know what that is.
[25:53.730 --> 25:56.250]  It was, like, a...
[25:58.510 --> 26:03.430]  It was just, like, a music video thing.
[26:04.290 --> 26:06.870]  Like, I don't know another way to describe it.
[26:07.370 --> 26:07.870]  No, that's fine.
[26:07.910 --> 26:08.710]  Yeah, I get it.
[26:08.890 --> 26:12.190]  It was just, like, he was the host and it would be on Friday night from, like,
[26:12.270 --> 26:14.130]  11 to midnight and they would just play videos.
[26:14.430 --> 26:17.070]  Yeah, just music videos and, like, sometimes, like, live.
[26:17.110 --> 26:18.390]  I feel like live performance stuff.
[26:18.390 --> 26:19.630]  Yeah, and they'd have, like, interviews and stuff.
[26:19.710 --> 26:21.990]  It looked like this is the only image I can find of it.
[26:25.570 --> 26:28.010]  Oh, I recognize that logo now.
[26:29.210 --> 26:31.270]  Never seen it, but yeah.
[26:37.900 --> 26:38.300]  Jesus.
[26:40.380 --> 26:41.780]  They're still hanging out here, huh?
[26:45.560 --> 26:47.620]  I was talking about Arsenio Hall yesterday.
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.040]  How I wish there was a court show that had his audience when he had a talk show.
[26:53.460 --> 26:56.600]  That'd be such a great, like, the barking thing.
[26:59.220 --> 27:00.340]  Barking's back, dude.
[27:01.120 --> 27:01.600]  Is it?
[27:01.600 --> 27:04.020]  Oh, dude, barking's back big time.
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.340]  Like, I think you're going to start hearing it in sports over, like, the next year.
[27:07.500 --> 27:08.180]  Barking's back.
[27:08.740 --> 27:09.340]  What do you mean, barking?
[27:09.820 --> 27:11.860]  Yeah, dude, in wrestling, barking's back.
[27:11.980 --> 27:15.460]  We got, like, five different guys who got, like, bark stuff going on and we did not
[27:15.460 --> 27:16.540]  at, like, six months ago.
[27:16.680 --> 27:17.200]  It rocks.
[27:17.480 --> 27:18.260]  Barking's so back.
[27:19.160 --> 27:20.060]  What are you talking about?
[27:22.020 --> 27:23.720]  What do you mean, what are you talking about?
[27:23.840 --> 27:24.040]  Yeah.
[27:25.280 --> 27:26.760]  Like, making noise like a dog?
[27:27.100 --> 27:27.380]  Yeah.
[27:27.600 --> 27:30.440]  Well, I didn't know how to categorize Arsenio Hall's thing.
[27:30.500 --> 27:31.380]  He was barking, right?
[27:31.600 --> 27:33.120]  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.400]  Yeah, and doing, like, the fist thing.
[27:34.400 --> 27:35.980]  And all the audience would do that?
[27:36.040 --> 27:36.180]  Yeah.
[27:36.700 --> 27:36.880]  Yep.
[27:37.020 --> 27:38.840]  I was gonna say, is it more of a woof, woof or a bow, wow?
[27:40.540 --> 27:41.420]  Nah, it's just barking, dude.
[27:41.940 --> 27:43.100]  2024, it's whatever you want it to be, man.
[27:43.480 --> 27:44.020]  Wow, nice.
[27:44.600 --> 27:46.980]  I think this might be some of the footage where I've seen
[27:47.560 --> 27:51.200]  the most of in relation to participated in the least.
[27:53.120 --> 27:53.440]  What?
[27:54.420 --> 27:56.080]  I've just seen people work out a ton.
[27:56.660 --> 27:57.580]  You have played basketball?
[27:58.020 --> 27:58.780]  You've played basketball?
[27:59.700 --> 28:00.180]  Uh, yeah.
[28:00.280 --> 28:00.820]  You've done this.
[28:00.820 --> 28:01.100]  Well, I've played a little bit.
[28:01.100 --> 28:02.460]  You want to say you want to go play?
[28:02.580 --> 28:03.320]  You want to shoot hoops, Gavin?
[28:04.100 --> 28:05.300]  Yeah, Gavin, you want to go shoot hoops?
[28:05.800 --> 28:06.720]  Do I have to run around?
[28:07.800 --> 28:09.120]  No, I mean, we just, I mean.
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.300]  Aren't you the one that wanted to challenge Nick to a foot race?
[28:13.620 --> 28:14.900]  What do you mean, do I have to run around?
[28:21.140 --> 28:21.820]  Yeah, what was it?
[28:21.920 --> 28:23.340]  Was we going to do a 1500 or something?
[28:23.580 --> 28:23.860]  What?
[28:24.860 --> 28:25.240]  I don't.
[28:25.700 --> 28:26.640]  I don't remember.
[28:26.760 --> 28:27.140]  Is that it?
[28:27.280 --> 28:30.340]  I just want to see you guys sprint at full speed and slow motion.
[28:32.940 --> 28:34.360]  Oh, I got to start eating better.
[28:36.220 --> 28:36.940]  Oh, that reminds me.
[28:36.960 --> 28:39.540]  I was listening to our podcast today and I got to get a new puzzle for us.
[28:40.220 --> 28:40.540]  Yes.
[28:41.300 --> 28:41.960]  Do you want me to make a note?
[28:42.080 --> 28:42.820]  Remind you or what?
[28:43.040 --> 28:43.820]  Are you going to do it?
[28:44.020 --> 28:45.020]  Yeah, I'll need a note.
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.540]  I'm looking right now, but I'll need a note.
[28:46.880 --> 28:47.260]  I got you.
[28:47.340 --> 28:47.800]  I'll make a note.
[28:50.700 --> 28:51.700]  Oh, that's pretty.
[28:53.080 --> 28:53.940]  Are you looking at puzzles?
[28:53.940 --> 28:54.840]  Don't look at puzzles right now.
[28:54.880 --> 28:55.380]  I'm watching AIDS.
[28:55.540 --> 28:56.000]  I'm watching AIDS.
[28:59.400 --> 29:00.500]  So what was pretty?
[29:01.860 --> 29:02.680]  Uh, Carrie's hair.
[29:02.940 --> 29:03.780]  She's got pretty hair.
[29:06.480 --> 29:07.660]  What year was this?
[29:09.220 --> 29:10.720]  1992, I think.
[29:10.840 --> 29:12.220]  Oh, I bet this is 91, 92.
[29:12.380 --> 29:12.600]  Yeah.
[29:12.920 --> 29:14.100]  I mean, I bet that's it.
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.440]  I think it said 92.
[29:16.060 --> 29:17.420]  She's like mid-50s now.
[29:18.100 --> 29:22.640]  He looks like a quarterback the Cardinals would draft at like seventh overall
[29:23.160 --> 29:24.740]  and was never that great.
[29:26.220 --> 29:27.480]  By the hot tub party.
[29:27.740 --> 29:28.480]  It's pretty good.
[29:28.820 --> 29:29.400]  I don't know about that.
[29:29.460 --> 29:31.680]  He just exudes Cardinal first round pick.
[29:31.940 --> 29:32.760]  That wasn't good.
[29:33.820 --> 29:35.940]  Oh, how are you guys feeling about kicker picker right now?
[29:37.020 --> 29:38.880]  I keep getting kickers hurt.
[29:39.080 --> 29:39.820]  I hate it.
[29:39.860 --> 29:43.560]  But although like if any of us was going to have a kicker picker issue, it should probably be me.
[29:43.980 --> 29:46.300]  Yeah, I'm like middle of the middle of the road.
[29:46.420 --> 29:47.300]  I think I'm in third place.
[29:47.580 --> 29:48.120]  Like whatever.
[29:50.980 --> 29:51.660]  Feeling pretty bad.
[29:52.160 --> 29:53.840]  Yeah, Nick is also down a kicker.
[29:55.020 --> 29:57.940]  I'm in a real fucked up place where one of my kickers got hurt,
[29:57.980 --> 30:00.740]  and I'm hoping the kicker that got fired gets his job.
[30:01.560 --> 30:01.960]  Wow.
[30:03.940 --> 30:06.360]  Should we like when we're halfway through the season?
[30:06.460 --> 30:09.940]  Should like, yeah, we talked about the bottom like redrafting.
[30:10.460 --> 30:11.920]  Uh, like, yes, please.
[30:14.680 --> 30:15.860]  Yeah, this might be good.
[30:16.100 --> 30:17.400]  I think maybe this is the way we do it.
[30:17.460 --> 30:19.260]  We get to like week eight or nine.
[30:19.820 --> 30:20.880]  Yeah, when is week eight?
[30:27.210 --> 30:29.830]  Sinbad is in the store right across from this as a condom.
[30:31.030 --> 30:31.430]  Okay.
[30:31.990 --> 30:32.830]  October 27.
[30:32.830 --> 30:36.890]  Do you think this is the same mall that Pauly Shore was walking around?
[30:44.950 --> 30:46.650]  Wow, that steering wheel will kill someone.
[30:49.630 --> 30:52.570]  I'm gonna put a kicker picker redraft on everyone's calendar.
[30:53.150 --> 30:53.810]  That's a Mustang.
[30:55.050 --> 30:55.390]  Yeah.
[30:56.550 --> 30:59.130]  Do you think of anything specific when you see a steering wheel?
[31:00.410 --> 31:01.250]  A car.
[31:01.250 --> 31:01.850]  Yeah.
[31:07.130 --> 31:08.550]  It's so stupid.
[31:10.510 --> 31:10.910]  Car.
[31:12.850 --> 31:13.930]  What were you?
[31:14.050 --> 31:15.570]  What were you driving at here, Drew?
[31:15.770 --> 31:15.990]  Yeah.
[31:16.270 --> 31:20.130]  Every time I see a steering wheel, I think of the scene in Gone in 60 Seconds where he
[31:20.130 --> 31:22.850]  takes the wheel off and puts a new wheel on to steal the car.
[31:23.390 --> 31:23.790]  Oh.
[31:24.150 --> 31:24.630]  Every time.
[31:25.250 --> 31:29.530]  Because it has like one of those brake, you know, like those jammers on the wheel.
[31:30.130 --> 31:31.630]  The club twist it.
[31:31.790 --> 31:32.290]  Yeah, the club.
[31:32.790 --> 31:32.870]  Yeah.
[31:32.990 --> 31:34.210]  They're like stealing cars.
[31:34.270 --> 31:35.370]  It has a club on the wheel.
[31:35.510 --> 31:39.810]  So he just rips the fucking wheel off and puts a new wheel on and then drives away.
[31:40.510 --> 31:41.690]  Hey, Christy Alley.
[31:44.860 --> 31:47.220]  She learned a lot about IV drug users.
[31:47.340 --> 31:48.040]  Look at her read.
[31:49.160 --> 31:51.180]  What do you think her best performance was?
[31:52.480 --> 31:53.560]  Look who's talking now.
[31:53.700 --> 31:54.020]  Cheers.
[31:55.080 --> 31:55.340]  Cheers.
[31:55.680 --> 31:59.460]  Is the camera turning and also her head is turning?
[32:01.340 --> 32:02.340]  Dizzy looking at that shot.
[32:02.840 --> 32:04.940]  She was she was getting Star Trek.
[32:12.410 --> 32:14.130]  Johnny Chill ever take off?
[32:15.710 --> 32:16.250]  It's Johnny.
[32:16.250 --> 32:16.970]  Johnny Gill.
[32:17.610 --> 32:17.730]  Gill?
[32:18.850 --> 32:19.830]  He's a singer.
[32:20.270 --> 32:20.910]  Oh, I didn't know.
[32:21.350 --> 32:22.690]  Yeah, he took off.
[32:22.890 --> 32:23.450]  He was the whole thing.
[32:23.950 --> 32:24.890]  Yeah, didn't know that.
[32:25.490 --> 32:26.070]  He was in.
[32:27.650 --> 32:28.470]  Fuck, what was he in?
[32:28.490 --> 32:29.490]  He was a new edition, right?
[32:30.590 --> 32:31.670]  Yeah, Johnny Gill was a new edition.
[32:31.810 --> 32:32.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:32.170 --> 32:32.930]  Yeah, he was a new edition.
[32:39.900 --> 32:40.160]  What?
[32:40.160 --> 32:42.120]  Safe sex is no sex.
[32:42.140 --> 32:42.660]  No, thanks.
[32:43.640 --> 32:46.140]  Ah, the healthiest meal is no meal.
[32:50.320 --> 32:52.020]  That's what the Texas legislature said.
[32:52.760 --> 32:53.820]  That map was upside down.
[33:02.650 --> 33:05.270]  This is such American sex education.
[33:05.690 --> 33:06.510]  Hey, don't do it.
[33:06.930 --> 33:07.710]  And I do agree.
[33:07.710 --> 33:08.690]  I agree with it.
[33:08.710 --> 33:10.090]  And that's why I still haven't.
[33:10.150 --> 33:12.510]  And I'm going to keep it going and keep that.
[33:12.510 --> 33:18.310]  Did you see that Lisa Marie Presley said that in her in her memoir that Michael
[33:18.310 --> 33:20.350]  Jackson was a virgin when they got married?
[33:20.930 --> 33:21.330]  Really?
[33:21.630 --> 33:22.770]  Like 34 or whatever.
[33:23.150 --> 33:23.350]  Yeah.
[33:24.450 --> 33:24.850]  Wow.
[33:25.210 --> 33:27.170]  He's doing in solidarity with Magic Johnson.
[33:28.490 --> 33:30.290]  There's there's hope for me yet.
[33:30.870 --> 33:32.550]  I better see him in this PSA then.
[33:39.760 --> 33:44.040]  Everyone here is like what you say, like high school, college age or whatever.
[33:44.240 --> 33:44.900]  Yes, yeah.
[33:45.500 --> 33:46.240]  But like.
[33:47.020 --> 33:50.560]  They look older than they do.
[33:51.300 --> 33:54.980]  You know, I don't know if it's like the hair or just like the look or what.
[33:55.060 --> 33:56.020]  But they look.
[33:56.420 --> 33:59.940]  It's possible that a lot of these people look younger now.
[34:00.900 --> 34:01.500]  Yeah, they do.
[34:01.700 --> 34:05.380]  At the time in which they're all like cosplaying their parents, it looks like.
[34:05.460 --> 34:05.580]  Yeah.
[34:14.940 --> 34:15.440]  That guy.
[34:15.740 --> 34:16.360]  Whoa, man.
[34:21.250 --> 34:23.790]  That's definitely like he's got like a quarterback look.
[34:23.910 --> 34:25.770]  Yeah, there's a Brock Purdy type guy.
[34:25.770 --> 34:28.630]  So everyone here we're looking at is in their 50s now.
[34:28.870 --> 34:29.170]  Yeah.
[34:29.990 --> 34:30.950]  About my age.
[34:32.870 --> 34:34.550]  Is this what I looked like in 1992?
[34:35.150 --> 34:35.210]  Fuck.
[34:39.830 --> 34:42.710]  Yeah, you look like that guy bottom left there with the haircut.
[34:43.130 --> 34:43.730]  Yeah, that's you.
[34:44.650 --> 34:47.330]  I would have been 16, 17.
[34:49.230 --> 34:50.050]  That's nuts.
[34:56.640 --> 34:57.320]  Not MCT.
[34:57.340 --> 34:57.860]  Ice cream.
[35:05.010 --> 35:05.370]  Yeah.
[35:12.730 --> 35:13.930]  I'm going to get Gavin to rap.
[35:14.190 --> 35:15.290]  This is how I'm going to do it.
[35:15.850 --> 35:17.690]  I'm going to say ice cream and DJ.
[35:17.750 --> 35:18.430]  No one showed up.
[35:18.770 --> 35:19.130]  Yeah.
[35:19.350 --> 35:20.550]  Gavin, you have to rap.
[35:20.950 --> 35:22.030]  Blindside, rap this.
[35:26.130 --> 35:27.510]  Blindside, you have to do my taxes.
[35:28.810 --> 35:29.710]  Oh, I'll do that.
[35:30.450 --> 35:31.130]  A-Dog.
[35:31.270 --> 35:31.970]  A-Dog.
[35:37.610 --> 35:39.810]  Did Arsenio ever have a music career?
[35:40.230 --> 35:41.270]  Oh, boy, I bet.
[35:41.410 --> 35:42.610]  I bet we could find an album.
[35:44.370 --> 35:47.870]  Like, I feel like this might be him being like, I want to do this,
[35:47.890 --> 35:50.450]  but I'm not going to like straight up declare it.
[35:50.510 --> 35:51.070]  So this is.
[35:55.080 --> 35:57.720]  I can't remember if I said the movie he was they were in
[35:57.720 --> 35:59.200]  was called White Nights or Harlem Nights.
[35:59.260 --> 36:01.680]  Those are both two movies, but it was Harlem Nights in case I got it wrong.
[36:01.980 --> 36:03.280]  You kept saying White Nights.
[36:03.380 --> 36:04.280]  I think you said White Nights.
[36:04.360 --> 36:06.260]  White Nights is a different movie with, I think, Gregory Hines.
[36:06.440 --> 36:08.600]  And who was in that?
[36:11.180 --> 36:12.920]  You just brimleyed it a little bit.
[36:14.420 --> 36:16.060]  Yeah, I guess I did.
[36:17.420 --> 36:17.660]  Similar.
[36:17.920 --> 36:18.680]  Well, not similar movie.
[36:18.760 --> 36:19.680]  White Nights is about dancing.
[36:24.580 --> 36:25.560]  Hey, you were close.
[36:27.460 --> 36:28.700]  But I meant Harlem Nights.
[36:28.840 --> 36:30.500]  White Nights, I also remember being good, but.
[36:30.800 --> 36:31.540]  Oh, I remember.
[36:31.760 --> 36:35.280]  I remember White Nights with Baryshnikov.
[36:35.580 --> 36:36.900]  Yeah, and Gregory Hines.
[36:38.600 --> 36:40.580]  And it was like a Russia, America.
[36:41.340 --> 36:45.420]  thing where they learned to respect each other on the on the dance floor or whatever.
[36:45.780 --> 36:45.980]  Yeah.
[36:47.060 --> 36:47.800]  How funny.
[36:47.960 --> 36:50.160]  Wow, this song is going on for a while.
[36:50.940 --> 36:54.840]  Arsenio Hall had a comedy rap album released under the name of his.
[36:55.140 --> 36:55.360]  Chunky A.
[36:55.360 --> 36:55.920]  Courtly rapping.
[36:56.280 --> 36:56.900]  Yeah, Chunky A.
[36:56.920 --> 36:58.040]  Oh, my God.
[36:58.280 --> 36:59.120]  Chunky A.
[36:59.340 --> 36:59.540]  Yeah.
[37:00.600 --> 37:01.940]  I remember that.
[37:04.840 --> 37:06.260]  Oh, I bet that doesn't age well.
[37:06.820 --> 37:08.660]  No, no, no, no.
[37:14.350 --> 37:16.050]  Oh, my God.
[37:16.550 --> 37:20.650]  All the people filming in this style in the early days must have really bad backs now.
[37:21.230 --> 37:23.710]  Yeah, there's Chunky A album.
[37:24.450 --> 37:27.590]  It's not like cameras were very, very light.
[37:27.930 --> 37:28.670]  You know what I mean?
[37:29.070 --> 37:32.210]  And they're like racking the zoom left and right.
[37:34.210 --> 37:40.650]  But it's it's a team effort because it's them and the guys whipping lights back and forth.
[37:41.370 --> 37:42.590]  You think that's a little manual?
[37:43.170 --> 37:43.310]  Yeah.
[37:45.570 --> 37:46.370]  In 91?
[37:46.870 --> 37:47.210]  Yeah.
[37:48.070 --> 37:49.970]  That might be the best photo of Arsenio Hall ever.
[37:54.600 --> 37:58.020]  On this budget, it's a guy whipping the light back and forth, no doubt.
[38:01.520 --> 38:04.360]  Man, we loved to put words on cards in the 90s, didn't we?
[38:04.860 --> 38:05.020]  Yeah.
[38:07.900 --> 38:09.920]  Kind of looks like the Terminator when the lights go off him.
[38:15.030 --> 38:16.030]  Come on, come on.
[38:23.560 --> 38:24.420]  Oh, cat.
[38:24.500 --> 38:25.100]  Oh, hell yeah.
[38:25.160 --> 38:26.080]  I'm about to go SMEE mode.
[38:27.260 --> 38:28.180]  Taking a shit?
[38:31.220 --> 38:32.000]  Color me bad.
[38:32.000 --> 38:32.940]  Is this Color Me Bad?
[38:33.200 --> 38:34.020]  Yeah, it is.
[38:34.640 --> 38:35.120]  That's...
[38:35.120 --> 38:37.260]  That dude wants to be George Michael so fucking bad.
[38:37.260 --> 38:38.000]  So bad.
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.900]  Which I think that guy is still going around doing Color Me Bad stuff.
[38:45.220 --> 38:47.360]  Like I just saw a TikTok of him live.
[38:51.370 --> 38:52.570]  They had a song.
[38:53.290 --> 38:53.470]  Yeah.
[38:53.470 --> 38:58.230]  And it was about sexing you up and how they wanted to do that.
[39:00.070 --> 39:04.450]  You think having the Color Me Bad segment be black and white was an intentional choice?
[39:15.750 --> 39:16.990]  Back to the cosplaying.
[39:17.730 --> 39:19.830]  That lady is either a teen or 30.
[39:19.910 --> 39:20.430]  Yes.
[39:20.690 --> 39:22.510]  Yeah, no in between.
[39:22.690 --> 39:27.010]  She's either 18 or she's a mid-level manager at a local bank.
[39:27.450 --> 39:29.110]  Where are they getting all these quarterbacks?
[39:32.510 --> 39:34.010]  Was that just a look?
[39:35.470 --> 39:37.790]  Was Ohio a hotbed for quarterbacks?
[39:38.030 --> 39:42.550]  That shirt and that haircut were the fucking look in 1992.
[39:53.190 --> 39:54.610]  She getting tested for AIDS?
[39:55.230 --> 39:55.430]  Yeah.
[40:04.020 --> 40:06.600]  That guy dresses the same now, guaranteed.
[40:08.640 --> 40:11.860]  Didn't they used to have to test for stuff with a Q-tip down the old...
[40:12.900 --> 40:13.940]  Oh my god, really?
[40:14.100 --> 40:14.400]  Did they?
[40:14.620 --> 40:14.920]  Yes.
[40:15.240 --> 40:16.220]  Not in my lifetime.
[40:17.520 --> 40:18.820]  AIDS would have been a blood test.
[40:19.300 --> 40:20.280]  Not the... not AIDS.
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.440]  No, I think it was maybe for like chlamydia or something.
[40:22.760 --> 40:23.340]  Yeah, chlamydia.
[40:23.540 --> 40:23.880]  Gonorrhea or something.
[40:24.300 --> 40:25.300]  Yeah, yeah, one of those.
[40:25.440 --> 40:27.400]  I think I have an unfortunate thing to tell you about your doctor.
[40:28.080 --> 40:30.260]  I don't think I know any of that.
[40:30.260 --> 40:32.120]  That's not my ear, that's not my ear, that's not my ear, that's not my ear.
[40:40.060 --> 40:41.500]  How much was an AIDS test?
[40:43.220 --> 40:43.860]  How much?
[40:44.020 --> 40:45.520]  I don't think I ever had to pay for one.
[40:45.760 --> 40:46.620]  No, I don't think so either.
[40:47.580 --> 40:48.900]  Yeah, I think it's covered with insurance.
[40:49.400 --> 40:51.020]  Not even... you just got a Planned Parenthood.
[40:51.460 --> 40:51.660]  Yeah.
[40:52.920 --> 40:54.040]  How non-American?
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.180]  I did that maybe... I don't know, eight, ten years ago, just for the hell of it.
[41:00.720 --> 41:01.960]  You got an AIDS test ten years ago?
[41:03.380 --> 41:07.800]  Maybe seven... whenever I got... whenever I got divorced and started dating again,
[41:08.180 --> 41:10.600]  I went and got all, you know, just a full round of tests and stuff.
[41:10.640 --> 41:11.440]  But I went to Planned Parenthood.
[41:11.460 --> 41:12.300]  It was super easy to do.
[41:12.720 --> 41:12.900]  Yep.
[41:13.060 --> 41:16.900]  And you're right, Andrew, it is very un-American and that's why people want to keep defunding it
[41:16.900 --> 41:19.340]  and they protest in front of it and blow them up.
[41:19.940 --> 41:20.100]  Yeah.
[41:20.260 --> 41:20.420]  Yeah.
[41:20.420 --> 41:20.860]  Yeah.
[41:21.460 --> 41:22.820]  Oh what's up, it's Chris.
[41:34.110 --> 41:35.150]  He's bragging.
[41:35.470 --> 41:36.270]  Yeah, I don't wanna brag.
[41:36.590 --> 41:37.230]  Jesus Christ.
[41:37.850 --> 41:38.630]  Wow, that's...
[41:39.810 --> 41:41.970]  How old is this guy?
[41:42.990 --> 41:43.670]  Hehehehehe!
[41:43.870 --> 41:44.350]  Hahaha!
[41:46.810 --> 41:49.450]  Mike is really staring down that poster.
[41:51.470 --> 41:52.150]  Crazy.
[41:52.330 --> 41:53.210]  Another QB!
[41:53.610 --> 41:54.530]  Another quarterback!
[41:55.270 --> 41:56.870]  Kurt Cousins-looking motherfucker.
[41:57.370 --> 41:57.730]  Hahaha!
[41:58.430 --> 42:00.110]  He's got better hair than Kurt Cousins.
[42:00.110 --> 42:03.530]  Gavin, that's the thing. It's the haircut in the jaw.
[42:03.830 --> 42:07.050]  It's the head shape. Yeah, big time. Big square heads.
[42:11.590 --> 42:14.830]  I saw that there's an air hockey league now.
[42:15.350 --> 42:17.370]  What? Oh, yeah. Yeah, somewhere.
[42:17.950 --> 42:19.110]  It's not on Reddit, I think.
[42:22.070 --> 42:23.290]  And that doesn't shock me.
[42:23.710 --> 42:24.930]  It's a league for most things.
[42:25.570 --> 42:29.790]  I wonder if they get any coverage like ESPN or ESPN3 or whatever.
[42:30.970 --> 42:33.430]  Not yet, but I'll bet Pickleball's pretty close to it.
[42:36.230 --> 42:39.470]  You know, Pickleball's been around for like 50 fucking years.
[42:39.890 --> 42:43.170]  Oh, really? Yeah, it was invented in like the 60s
[42:43.630 --> 42:46.470]  or the 70s, but I think like late 60s.
[42:46.730 --> 42:49.270]  It's just like full court ping pong.
[42:49.370 --> 42:50.410]  Is that what it is, essentially?
[42:50.410 --> 42:52.890]  Yeah, it's like it's like easy mode tennis.
[42:53.210 --> 42:55.410]  I have no qualms with it at all.
[42:55.450 --> 42:57.110]  I've played it about as much as I've played tennis.
[42:57.250 --> 42:58.250]  It's one in the same.
[42:58.250 --> 43:00.890]  It's like if you want to play tennis and you don't feel like running
[43:01.770 --> 43:03.050]  or lunging, you know what I mean?
[43:03.090 --> 43:03.850]  You can play Pickleball.
[43:04.550 --> 43:07.950]  But it's weird to me that it's been around for so long
[43:07.950 --> 43:10.770]  and then it took off all at once, I don't know, five years ago.
[43:11.330 --> 43:11.830]  Should we play?
[43:12.850 --> 43:14.270]  Yeah, we should. Should we play doubles?
[43:15.090 --> 43:17.390]  Yes. Yes, we should. Yes, we should.
[43:17.450 --> 43:19.090]  I think I have a full set.
[43:19.850 --> 43:21.790]  Who are the team captains?
[43:24.730 --> 43:26.510]  Maybe that's how we'll beat, how we'll finish Feud.
[43:28.910 --> 43:31.370]  The winners get to be team captains in Pickleball?
[43:32.190 --> 43:34.390]  No, our team against their team, dummy.
[43:34.790 --> 43:35.450]  God damn.
[43:36.930 --> 43:38.890]  You need to open your open your door and your windows.
[43:39.830 --> 43:41.230]  Stop breathing in shit.
[43:41.730 --> 43:43.390]  So we just don't play the third round?
[43:44.510 --> 43:45.650]  Oh, we're playing the third round.
[43:46.110 --> 43:46.350]  OK.
[43:47.910 --> 43:50.990]  I just don't have enough survey questions to do the third round.
[43:51.270 --> 43:52.270]  I need to do another one.
[43:53.410 --> 43:55.230]  Is this a blind side of convenience?
[43:56.070 --> 43:57.670]  Yes. Uh, yes.
[43:57.670 --> 44:01.470]  No, we're running out of time in the year, and I wanted to make sure I got mine off.
[44:03.030 --> 44:04.290]  Feel like you just keep adding them.
[44:04.330 --> 44:05.450]  I feel like you already did them.
[44:06.370 --> 44:07.390]  Mine was last year, right?
[44:07.610 --> 44:09.030]  Yeah. You still have everyone else.
[44:09.190 --> 44:10.710]  Everyone here has both.
[44:11.230 --> 44:12.250]  Well, yeah, we're considerate.
[44:13.750 --> 44:15.310]  I thought the littlest hobo was this year.
[44:15.370 --> 44:16.090]  Was that last year?
[44:16.930 --> 44:17.570]  It was last year.
[44:19.010 --> 44:20.050]  Just don't think about it too much.
[44:20.050 --> 44:22.270]  Oh, no, no. We reset is what it when we.
[44:22.770 --> 44:23.690]  Oh, OK. Yeah.
[44:23.730 --> 44:24.670]  Here's the wrong answer.
[44:24.710 --> 44:26.190]  And then hang on. Here's the right answer.
[44:26.190 --> 44:27.550]  Oh, it's over.
[44:27.770 --> 44:28.950]  Written by Thad Mumford.
[44:29.150 --> 44:30.670]  See, we could have got all that information here.
[44:31.610 --> 44:32.350]  We could have. Yeah.
[44:32.370 --> 44:33.930]  Why didn't we just wait 30 minutes?
[44:34.370 --> 44:35.930]  We could have just made it to the end.
[44:36.770 --> 44:38.030]  Wow. A lot of audio engineers.
[44:38.310 --> 44:41.530]  That was a star studded PSA.
[44:41.670 --> 44:43.030]  Oh, great PSA.
[44:43.550 --> 44:43.950]  Interesting.
[44:45.170 --> 44:46.750]  It's star studded for the era.
[44:46.870 --> 44:48.570]  Obviously, probably half those people you all don't know.
[44:48.670 --> 44:51.670]  But for somebody who grew up in the 80s and 90s, that was fucking.
[44:51.790 --> 44:53.050]  They they really went all out.
[44:53.250 --> 44:54.550]  Yeah. For the time.
[44:55.050 --> 44:56.090]  Gavin, do you learn a lot?
[44:58.390 --> 45:00.290]  Oh, the cat.
[45:00.490 --> 45:02.530]  Oh, I thought maybe the cat smell got to him.
[45:02.570 --> 45:03.130]  I thought he was done.
[45:04.470 --> 45:05.350]  OK. OK.
[45:05.450 --> 45:06.770]  Match three. That's match three.
[45:07.090 --> 45:09.890]  No, what education?
[45:10.650 --> 45:11.090]  Winner.
[45:11.170 --> 45:13.710]  The question mark was unveiled as AIDS education.
[45:16.490 --> 45:19.870]  Well, thank you so much for watching another blindside.
[45:20.290 --> 45:21.590]  I had a lot of fun.
[45:21.910 --> 45:24.370]  It was fun having this be rescheduled multiple times.
[45:24.370 --> 45:25.870]  And me internally going, yeah, it's fine.
[45:26.170 --> 45:26.930]  It's not a priority.
[45:27.110 --> 45:28.490]  We'll get to this when we get to it.

[45:51.350 --> 45:53.830]  Oh, I forgot about fire incense stuff.
[45:53.990 --> 45:57.250]  With incense, we're going to try to set everything on fire with lit incense
[45:57.250 --> 45:58.650]  and see how successful we are.
[45:58.730 --> 46:00.390]  That'll be coming sometime in the next six months.

[46:02.710 --> 46:04.190]  We'll talk to y'all later.
