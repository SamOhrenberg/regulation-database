[00:25.880 --> 00:29.660]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:29.660 --> 00:33.760]  This is number 57, and going by our 2025 nicknames,
[00:33.900 --> 00:40.600]  I am Baby Pepsi with me as always, Gassy Goo, Gizmo, The Mecha Nick, and Lil Ricky B.
[00:41.080 --> 00:42.320]  Hello, everybody. How are we doing?
[00:42.800 --> 00:43.400]  I made a mistake.
[00:43.660 --> 00:44.420]  I'm great.
[00:46.260 --> 00:47.200]  I messed up.
[00:47.220 --> 00:47.740]  What was your mistake?
[00:48.280 --> 00:49.680]  What? What did you do?
[00:50.500 --> 00:52.140]  Well, I've been having a bit of a cold, right?
[00:52.380 --> 00:52.820]  And then...
[00:52.820 --> 00:53.020]  Yeah.
[00:54.940 --> 00:57.000]  I haven't been able to use the old pap.
[00:58.380 --> 00:59.480]  Because my nose has been running.
[00:59.740 --> 01:02.840]  But then I thought the sleep I'm getting is just dog shit.
[01:02.900 --> 01:07.020]  Like the other day, I fell asleep at like 6am because I couldn't sleep all night.
[01:07.700 --> 01:09.780]  So I thought last night, get back on the pap.
[01:10.960 --> 01:14.020]  And, um, nose, I guess, started running in the night
[01:14.020 --> 01:18.720]  with the pap pushing all the mucus back into my face, down my throat.
[01:19.500 --> 01:23.080]  And I woke up today with a mouthful of...
[01:24.100 --> 01:25.400]  It kind of looked like the gumpler.
[01:25.400 --> 01:28.940]  It was, it was a melted gumpler throat.
[01:29.440 --> 01:32.840]  You leaf blowered yourself with mucus, essentially.
[01:33.600 --> 01:39.120]  Yeah, I done the old mucus backwash backpipe horrendous.
[01:40.500 --> 01:42.260]  That's, uh, so...
[01:42.260 --> 01:43.500]  That's rough. Yeah, you don't sound good.
[01:44.080 --> 01:44.640]  It sounds like you're struggling.
[01:44.640 --> 01:48.880]  It seems to me that the CPAP is at best a dangerous machine to use.
[01:49.500 --> 01:51.640]  You gotta, you gotta pick your, pick your battles with it.
[01:51.800 --> 01:54.680]  Uh, I would say that Gavin's experience is not...
[01:55.400 --> 01:57.660]  The average, I would say.
[01:57.860 --> 02:03.400]  I feel like you have had a lot of problems that at least half of I have not encountered.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.960]  It's my first cold with it.
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.240]  It is a bad combo, the cold and the CPAP, for sure.
[02:08.380 --> 02:08.540]  Yeah.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.920]  I'm surprised that you, how long have you been up for?
[02:13.520 --> 02:14.000]  Today?
[02:14.600 --> 02:15.440]  Yeah, today.
[02:16.580 --> 02:17.220]  20 minutes?
[02:18.060 --> 02:20.500]  Okay, nevermind, that checks, that reads.
[02:20.740 --> 02:24.260]  Wait, you're, aren't you, I thought you're like an early morning guy,
[02:24.260 --> 02:26.080]  but then you're just all fucked up from this thing?
[02:26.640 --> 02:28.360]  Yeah, usually I'm up at 7 or 8.
[02:30.800 --> 02:31.880]  That was the end of the sentence.
[02:32.440 --> 02:36.000]  I, yeah, I thought there was, the tone in which you delivered that
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.820]  really felt like you're gonna expand.
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.360]  You kinda, you really, you ended it up as if there was something to follow.
[02:42.680 --> 02:47.380]  I'm gonna need you to be up at least 30 minutes before any recording going forward.
[02:48.060 --> 02:50.980]  You wanna take 10 minutes to gather yourself and we'll just, we'll vamp?
[02:52.240 --> 02:53.700]  No, I'm, I'm, I'm around.
[02:53.700 --> 02:56.360]  I mean, I've experienced what Gavin's gone through,
[02:56.480 --> 02:59.240]  but it's typically if I use the machine without putting water in it.
[02:59.400 --> 03:02.960]  And then there's probably a rough, like, 30 minutes at the start of the day.
[03:03.180 --> 03:03.980]  So you should be almost done.
[03:04.520 --> 03:07.000]  Oh, maybe I'll, maybe I'll settle for the next 10 minutes, that'll be nice.
[03:07.580 --> 03:10.700]  Can I ask what you did with the gumbler that was in your mouth when you woke up?
[03:11.360 --> 03:11.900]  Oh, God.
[03:13.340 --> 03:15.200]  Okay, I was just checking, man.
[03:15.220 --> 03:16.560]  I just kinda wanna see what kind of guy you were.
[03:17.180 --> 03:19.080]  Uh, well, I went for tissue immediately and I thought,
[03:19.300 --> 03:20.780]  this tissue is not built for this.
[03:22.240 --> 03:22.740]  It's not.
[03:24.220 --> 03:25.560]  It's always a risky gamble.
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.000]  Yeah.
[03:27.320 --> 03:29.500]  Oh man, I feel bad for you.
[03:30.500 --> 03:32.800]  Have you, have you done like a full, full nose blow?
[03:34.800 --> 03:35.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:35.900 --> 03:36.260]  Okay.
[03:37.020 --> 03:38.240]  Find some down the sink.
[03:40.500 --> 03:42.820]  What percentage would you say you're at right now?
[03:44.200 --> 03:45.000]  Oh, 70.
[03:45.780 --> 03:48.160]  Wow, what were you at yesterday when we were in the office?
[03:48.780 --> 03:49.160]  85.
[03:49.900 --> 03:53.340]  Yeah, you sounded great from what I could tell, at least comparative.
[03:53.700 --> 03:54.480]  Lead to this.
[03:55.060 --> 03:58.540]  I felt so much better yesterday because I got good sleep the night before.
[03:58.860 --> 04:01.680]  And then, uh, I thought, you know, now's the time to go back on the pap.
[04:02.440 --> 04:02.720]  Yeah.
[04:02.840 --> 04:03.240]  Big mistake.
[04:03.720 --> 04:05.980]  Yeah, so you re-papped a little early, you think, maybe?
[04:06.120 --> 04:07.240]  Yeah, I re-papped too early.
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.980]  I'm gonna wait, uh, probably an extra day next time.
[04:10.540 --> 04:12.320]  There should be a way to do a reverse pap.
[04:13.040 --> 04:16.340]  Where everything blows out, you somehow have a way to go up.
[04:16.340 --> 04:17.460]  Is that like a stomach pump?
[04:17.900 --> 04:19.320]  I guess, yeah.
[04:19.320 --> 04:24.020]  I don't know where the point of, uh, entrance would be.
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.360]  I always heard about my friends when I was at school getting a stomach pump because they drank
[04:27.360 --> 04:27.860]  too much.
[04:28.120 --> 04:32.060]  But it always seemed like it was quite traumatic and I never asked how they actually do it.
[04:32.480 --> 04:33.600]  Did you say always?
[04:34.060 --> 04:35.280]  Was this a common thing?
[04:35.460 --> 04:37.360]  Kids getting their stomach pumped when you grew up?
[04:37.660 --> 04:38.580]  Yeah, I grew up in England.
[04:43.260 --> 04:46.240]  Yeah, I had one friend who had like four stomach pumps, I think.
[04:47.300 --> 04:47.700]  What?
[04:49.360 --> 04:49.800]  That's...
[04:49.800 --> 04:51.260]  He would just get too buffed up.
[04:51.640 --> 04:54.660]  He'd have like a ninth pint and he'd be like, oh, that was too many.
[04:56.080 --> 04:58.100]  And just walk himself to the emergency room to get pumped?
[04:58.700 --> 04:59.720]  Yeah, but I just don't know.
[05:00.120 --> 05:01.920]  Is it just a hose down the throat?
[05:02.580 --> 05:08.720]  I guess if you've done it like once and you're okay with it, there's no barrier at that point.
[05:10.620 --> 05:12.740]  Has anyone here gotten their stomach pumped?
[05:13.200 --> 05:13.500]  Never.
[05:14.440 --> 05:14.840]  Never ever.
[05:14.840 --> 05:20.740]  And I grew up in Alabama where people did dumb shit to themselves and each other all fucking day long.
[05:21.220 --> 05:26.000]  And I knew one girl in high school who got her stomach pumped for taking too many aspirin, I think.
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.580]  But like, that was it.
[05:27.900 --> 05:29.700]  Yeah, like I can't...
[05:30.500 --> 05:34.420]  I can't think of anyone that I know that got their stomach pumped other than like Rod Stewart.
[05:34.660 --> 05:35.440]  And like, that's it.
[05:36.920 --> 05:39.900]  I not only have never had my stomach pumped,
[05:40.300 --> 05:44.520]  it has never crossed my mind that that would be a solution to whatever ails me.
[05:44.960 --> 05:46.440]  At any point in my life.
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.080]  It has never been a consideration.
[05:49.440 --> 05:50.560]  Four stomach pumps.
[05:52.180 --> 05:55.800]  Is there like a stomach pump specialist over there for you?
[05:55.940 --> 05:56.840]  Is there like a pumper?
[05:57.920 --> 06:01.000]  I figured it's just like one of the machines they have behind the reception desk.
[06:01.140 --> 06:02.340]  It's like, oh, come on, go around it.
[06:03.420 --> 06:07.160]  It's like how you can go into the store and get the like the liquid IV hydration or whatever.
[06:07.440 --> 06:09.960]  You just like you go the other stall is stomach pump.
[06:10.820 --> 06:11.880]  Oh my god.
[06:12.320 --> 06:12.820]  That's crazy.
[06:12.820 --> 06:13.440]  That was really funny, Eric.
[06:14.180 --> 06:14.980]  Thanks, man.
[06:14.980 --> 06:16.100]  I felt really good.
[06:16.140 --> 06:18.460]  I felt really good about the Rod Stewart thing.
[06:22.040 --> 06:23.360]  You had it out.
[06:23.480 --> 06:27.060]  You had it out so much faster than I was just forming the idea.
[06:27.260 --> 06:28.820]  And it was I was started to laugh.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.240]  That's not your first thought.
[06:30.320 --> 06:30.700]  What do you hear?
[06:30.800 --> 06:31.400]  Stomach pump?
[06:32.620 --> 06:34.520]  Yeah, it just wasn't that fast on the update.
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.800]  He said stomach pump minutes ago.
[06:36.840 --> 06:40.520]  And I'm like, all right, we got to we got to walk this road for a little while before I get this one out.
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.680]  Jesus Christ.
[06:45.100 --> 06:49.380]  Apparently, just really common in England, you know, for you drink it too much of anything.
[06:49.980 --> 06:52.900]  Yeah, my friend, my friend Steph, she had a few.
[06:52.980 --> 06:54.260]  Yeah, well, a pint of what?
[06:56.900 --> 06:58.320]  Nine pints of huh?
[07:00.540 --> 07:01.340]  Just booze.
[07:01.540 --> 07:02.580]  Well, a pint's a bigger than that.
[07:02.660 --> 07:06.900]  I would like to hear this would be a perfect toad in the whole situation,
[07:06.900 --> 07:10.140]  because I want somebody from where Gavin's from to just say no.
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.720]  Are you talking like this is something very specific to Gavin's friend group
[07:14.720 --> 07:18.020]  and is not nearly as wide as he's acting like it is.
[07:18.040 --> 07:21.960]  Well, can I invite the friends I've not spoken to in 25 years to go to the whole?
[07:21.960 --> 07:23.700]  I think they just validate your point.
[07:24.240 --> 07:28.580]  I mean, you can do whatever you want, but like as far as somehow changing that narrative,
[07:28.600 --> 07:33.060]  I think like I believe it's not that I disagree with what you're saying.
[07:33.060 --> 07:36.040]  It's that I would just love to hear somebody else's perspective,
[07:36.040 --> 07:40.560]  not in your circle, and just be like, no, this is that's horrifying.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.400]  Yeah, they all said it so casually.
[07:42.640 --> 07:45.220]  I'd love to hear from the kid who got his stomach pumped four times,
[07:45.220 --> 07:48.820]  because in the last 20 years, you figure he's good for another five or six, right?
[07:49.460 --> 07:52.720]  He was an absolute machine. He could easily put away eight pints.
[07:53.060 --> 07:54.620]  It sounds like he couldn't keep them away, though.
[07:55.020 --> 07:57.660]  Yeah, I think it was the ninth and tenth that usually did him in,
[07:57.700 --> 08:02.800]  but he would easily be stood there at Waitrose on 7 a.m.
[08:02.800 --> 08:06.620]  stacking the salad, just kind of swaying on eight pints.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.220]  And he somehow managed to be there on time every week.
[08:09.800 --> 08:12.320]  And he had a punch card for fucking stomach pumping.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.800]  I've never really thought about it. I don't know how any of this works.
[08:16.200 --> 08:18.420]  Like when I imagine someone getting stomach pumped,
[08:18.460 --> 08:22.620]  I imagine that minigame in Mario Party where you got to inflate the giant Bowser balloon.
[08:22.820 --> 08:24.800]  Like that is sort of the visual...
[08:26.220 --> 08:26.980]  I don't know how...
[08:27.500 --> 08:29.060]  It's just two doctors thumping a button.
[08:29.820 --> 08:32.640]  Yeah, it's a definite thump situation.
[08:32.800 --> 08:33.600]  In my head.
[08:33.900 --> 08:37.780]  There's like maybe one of those, you know, like foot pumps
[08:37.780 --> 08:41.900]  that is mashing their foot over and over again, getting the pump going.
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.740]  I'd love to know who is the first person that required the stomach pump.
[08:47.080 --> 08:48.360]  Probably someone who got poisoned.
[08:48.940 --> 08:49.600]  You think so?
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.760]  I guess that would make sense.
[08:51.900 --> 08:54.980]  Who was the first person to get...
[08:54.980 --> 08:57.400]  Just the idea of being like, oh, you know what we need?
[08:57.520 --> 08:58.500]  Stomach pump for this.
[08:58.880 --> 09:00.660]  Fuck, that's not invented yet.
[09:00.660 --> 09:02.580]  Well, yeah, but like it's not even...
[09:02.580 --> 09:07.420]  It's not even crazy because when you think about like how like where surgeries came from
[09:07.420 --> 09:09.760]  and like all this stuff or whatever, sometimes it's like, wow,
[09:09.780 --> 09:11.100]  how did they even get started with this?
[09:11.460 --> 09:13.660]  This is just something is in there.
[09:13.740 --> 09:14.800]  We have to get it out.
[09:15.080 --> 09:16.940]  Shove a tube down to get it.
[09:17.180 --> 09:21.920]  It was probably like turn them upside down at first and then they figured out suction.
[09:22.460 --> 09:27.100]  But like that's not probably too far off from like how it started to where it is now.
[09:27.160 --> 09:30.320]  Just technology is doing the pumping instead of a guy on one end.
[09:30.320 --> 09:33.780]  Siphoning it out like a gas tank.
[09:34.260 --> 09:37.980]  Would you guys like to guess what year the...
[09:37.980 --> 09:41.720]  If anybody can guess the year and you're not cheating, I'll give you a vinyl.
[09:42.340 --> 09:44.720]  For the year the stomach pump was invented.
[09:44.960 --> 09:46.600]  Damn, I was going to say 1810.
[09:46.840 --> 09:47.360]  God damn.
[09:48.000 --> 09:48.620]  God damn it.
[09:48.620 --> 09:51.440]  I got an 1850 from Gavin, 1810 from Eric.
[09:51.540 --> 09:52.920]  No, mine was 15, 1815.
[09:53.380 --> 09:56.500]  I'm going to change mine to 1799.
[09:57.140 --> 09:57.520]  Okay.
[09:57.740 --> 09:58.120]  All right.
[09:58.280 --> 09:58.660]  Interesting.
[09:58.660 --> 09:59.960]  Nick and Andrew.
[10:00.380 --> 10:01.160]  Big part of the year.
[10:01.640 --> 10:02.140]  1910.
[10:02.520 --> 10:03.880]  I'm going to say 1905.
[10:05.260 --> 10:06.980]  Gavin was the closest.
[10:08.540 --> 10:14.440]  Alexander Monroe, a Scottish physician, invented the stomach pump in 1767.
[10:15.240 --> 10:15.680]  Wow.
[10:16.200 --> 10:16.440]  Okay.
[10:16.660 --> 10:19.000]  So Gavin wasn't the closest.
[10:19.620 --> 10:20.080]  Oh, sorry.
[10:20.160 --> 10:20.900]  Eric was the closest.
[10:21.040 --> 10:21.430]  Whoever said...
[10:22.240 --> 10:23.440]  You guys are right neck and neck.
[10:24.640 --> 10:25.500]  You know what?
[10:25.620 --> 10:26.000]  You know what?
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.480]  Closest doesn't get you a vinyl.
[10:27.480 --> 10:28.320]  Yeah, I know.
[10:28.700 --> 10:29.700]  Jesus Christ.
[10:30.320 --> 10:30.820]  Oh, man.
[10:31.140 --> 10:32.780]  Nick, did you say 1910?
[10:33.400 --> 10:33.760]  Yeah.
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.440]  Well, there's a thumbnail for this week.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.640]  Visual of a stomach pump.
[10:43.040 --> 10:43.700]  Horrifying.
[10:43.920 --> 10:49.060]  You think the stomach pump didn't exist during Red Dead Redemption 2?
[10:51.360 --> 10:52.040]  What?
[10:54.320 --> 10:55.400]  Seems recent.
[10:55.400 --> 10:58.620]  You think the stomach pump didn't exist during Expedition 33?
[11:01.620 --> 11:05.640]  I hope they didn't keep that thing in the same drawer as the horse inseminator.
[11:06.220 --> 11:07.020]  Oh, no.
[11:07.120 --> 11:08.180]  Pretty damn close.
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.640]  And, you know, they didn't know about washing shit back then either.
[11:14.240 --> 11:17.360]  I, uh, speaking of old surgery stuff,
[11:17.400 --> 11:21.820]  there is no thing less created for me than the show The Nick.
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.140]  As somebody who struggles with surgery stuff like that is,
[11:27.140 --> 11:28.960]  I hear it's fantastic.
[11:29.200 --> 11:30.440]  I can never watch it.
[11:30.800 --> 11:31.100]  Impossible.
[11:31.160 --> 11:33.080]  Dude, I got a worse one for you.
[11:33.200 --> 11:36.380]  My wife watches this show, The Pit.
[11:36.940 --> 11:37.720]  Fuck me.
[11:37.820 --> 11:42.880]  That is the grossest, most gore-filled show I've ever seen in my entire life.
[11:43.100 --> 11:45.100]  It's like Eli Roth directs every episode.
[11:45.420 --> 11:46.240]  Oh, Jesus.
[11:47.460 --> 11:48.660]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[11:49.240 --> 11:52.840]  I don't like, I enjoy, you know, but that's good TikTok content.
[11:53.280 --> 11:56.960]  I want to see the TikTok of the guy stuck in cement that they can't fix
[11:56.960 --> 12:01.320]  for exactly 45 seconds, and then I'm good.
[12:01.800 --> 12:02.600]  That's all I need.
[12:02.960 --> 12:07.080]  I've only seen The Pit on TikTok, so it is great TikTok content.
[12:07.180 --> 12:08.440]  That's fake ER, right?
[12:08.680 --> 12:09.040]  The Pit?
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.200]  Uh, yes, it is.
[12:10.280 --> 12:12.340]  Yeah, it's like the spiritual successor to ER.
[12:12.400 --> 12:14.160]  Michael Crichton's estate is furious.
[12:14.540 --> 12:15.120]  Not happy.
[12:15.460 --> 12:16.460]  Yeah, HBO's doing well.
[12:16.460 --> 12:21.600]  Were you bummed, Andrew, that you didn't come close to passing out in the autopsy simulator video?
[12:21.960 --> 12:22.860]  I was pretty tingly.
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.660]  Like, it wasn't, I didn't have symptoms, but I had, I got enough out of it to not be disappointed.
[12:29.400 --> 12:32.180]  It'd be funnier if it was worse, but like, I was happy.
[12:32.740 --> 12:35.980]  Well, happy maybe isn't the right word, but I was glad that...
[12:35.980 --> 12:38.240]  How much further would you take it, or is that it?
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.540]  Oh, no, I'd love to do it again.
[12:39.700 --> 12:41.120]  We just haven't had time on the schedule.
[12:41.360 --> 12:42.260]  I'd love to do another part.
[12:42.940 --> 12:43.880]  I want to see what's going on there.
[12:44.060 --> 12:44.780]  Ghosts or something?
[12:45.140 --> 12:45.760]  I don't know.
[12:46.460 --> 12:48.160]  You guys couldn't hear the audio when we did it?
[12:48.200 --> 12:49.140]  Got demonetized there.
[12:49.620 --> 12:50.160]  I don't care.
[12:50.900 --> 12:51.300]  Whatever.
[12:53.580 --> 12:54.740]  We've got to get those bodies.
[12:54.860 --> 12:55.560]  We've got to open them up.
[12:56.900 --> 12:57.060]  Yeah.
[12:57.120 --> 12:57.780]  See what's inside.
[12:59.060 --> 12:59.840]  There's a spirit.
[13:00.020 --> 13:02.740]  Jeff, we played a surgery game and we think there's a ghost.
[13:03.680 --> 13:04.440]  It's tough to read.
[13:05.060 --> 13:08.960]  I watched probably like seven or eight minutes of it and I was confused because I was bouncing
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.240]  around and you'd just be like doing a normal autopsy and then there'd be a cut scene of
[13:12.240 --> 13:14.420]  skulls or something and then it was weird.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.880]  Yeah, it's a game I'm excited to play more of, but surgery stuff.
[13:21.920 --> 13:22.280]  No, thanks.
[13:22.980 --> 13:28.680]  Hey, speaking of games, should we mention that we had a bit of a milestone yesterday?
[13:29.820 --> 13:33.060]  We went into the office and I know it's so weird, right?
[13:33.080 --> 13:34.260]  Because we record a little bit ahead.
[13:34.500 --> 13:39.180]  So it's been weeks since we have had an office at this point.
[13:39.200 --> 13:44.040]  But in the real, in our recording time, it's only been about a week since we did the stream.
[13:44.040 --> 13:50.940]  And so we went in yesterday and we recorded our first gameplay from the computers in the office
[13:50.940 --> 13:52.740]  and fucked it up.
[13:52.820 --> 13:53.880]  But it was fun.
[13:54.880 --> 13:55.900]  It looked fun.
[13:57.200 --> 13:59.460]  Yeah, it just didn't sound fun.
[14:00.580 --> 14:06.800]  Yeah, we learned some stuff, got some audio channels to fix and reroute.
[14:07.140 --> 14:09.620]  But other than that, I think we're in business.
[14:09.620 --> 14:14.000]  Also, we finished filming or we filmed the next part of the Gumpler saga,
[14:14.140 --> 14:16.900]  which I'm really excited about the audience getting to see.
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.020]  That's one thing I'm enjoying about the new office is that we're already into sagas where it's like,
[14:21.040 --> 14:21.860]  oh, this didn't work.
[14:22.200 --> 14:25.980]  But, you know, let's not spoil too much of the videos here.
[14:26.060 --> 14:31.000]  But yeah, it's we've decided there'll be there'll be more Gumpler videos for sure.
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.880]  I was sad to have missed everything, but I was in the dentist and it brought me joy
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.980]  while laying in the chair and pain knowing that you guys were in an office in Austin
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.080]  figuring out how the Gumpler works.
[14:45.500 --> 14:48.720]  I was very happy. That was that was the one thing I had going for me.
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.320]  Oh, it was sad looking over to the the dead eyes of the little robot.
[14:55.480 --> 14:56.840]  Yeah, he was asleep.
[14:57.340 --> 14:59.020]  How are you? How are you doing, Andrew?
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.340]  You were feeling pretty rough yesterday when we were talking.
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.460]  What would you say? You're like no pain today. You're totally fine.
[15:04.600 --> 15:05.560]  No pain. Totally good.
[15:05.560 --> 15:08.380]  It's funny because I came when I got home.
[15:08.440 --> 15:11.060]  I came back home. I realized just leaving.
[15:11.340 --> 15:13.380]  I came by itself. Terrible idea.
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.040]  When I came home, I opened the thing to be like, I wonder if they're still there.
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.100]  What's going on? And you guys were just starting your test.
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.600]  And I really wanted to roll in and just be like, ah, but I was I was too.
[15:26.720 --> 15:27.880]  I was out. I was done.
[15:28.380 --> 15:29.600]  That just took a lot out of me.
[15:29.760 --> 15:32.160]  Did not have the energy for it, but I popped out later.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.560]  Like emotionally or physically, did he take a lot of teeth out of you?
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.720]  Emotionally and also just like I might half my face was numb.
[15:42.840 --> 15:48.960]  So just like rolling up and really wasn't just didn't have it in me in that moment.
[15:49.040 --> 15:52.820]  And plus, you guys all had headphones on and there is nothing I thought would be more
[15:52.820 --> 15:56.680]  disappointing than to go through it. And you guys not notice at all.
[15:57.100 --> 16:00.140]  So I was like, it's just not it's not worth it. I'll come back later.
[16:00.460 --> 16:01.280]  I'll recover a little bit.
[16:01.280 --> 16:04.960]  When you texted that you were at the dentist and in pain, I almost cried.
[16:05.100 --> 16:06.380]  I have such a dental anxiety.
[16:06.380 --> 16:08.360]  Yeah, I'm transferring it to other people now.
[16:08.500 --> 16:12.320]  And I felt so all I could think about last night was you and the dentist.
[16:12.600 --> 16:14.020]  I'm so glad you're feeling better today.
[16:14.260 --> 16:18.820]  I learned that apparently if you have like a tooth crack, they can't easily detect it via
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.900]  their X-rays.
[16:20.420 --> 16:22.700]  So you got to vocalize it, which I'm glad I did.
[16:22.880 --> 16:23.180]  Really?
[16:23.760 --> 16:29.320]  I guess like the perspective in which cracks usually occur and the like angle that they
[16:29.320 --> 16:30.520]  get, like it lines up.
[16:30.620 --> 16:33.040]  So it's hard to tell if there's a crack in it.
[16:33.200 --> 16:35.180]  Like the tooth will visually look fine.
[16:35.200 --> 16:38.260]  But obviously, upon special, you knew it was cracked, though.
[16:38.800 --> 16:44.160]  Yeah, I had a feeling because I had I had cracked it two days before I had an appointment
[16:44.160 --> 16:45.200]  for something else.
[16:46.140 --> 16:51.000]  And I thought, oh, maybe, you know, like I just ate something the wrong way, like I jammed
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.240]  in my gum or something and then I could feel my tongue.
[16:53.300 --> 16:55.400]  And I was like, I think that's I think I split.
[16:56.060 --> 16:56.880]  That's not great.
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.740]  So then, yeah, I had to go in and they're like, OK, so we're going to do this.
[17:00.840 --> 17:02.720]  And I had to go, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:02.840 --> 17:03.460]  One second.
[17:04.280 --> 17:08.340]  I have a I think I have a crack and they're like, oh, this tooth.
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.720]  And I said, no, that that one.
[17:10.080 --> 17:11.840]  That's what I was supposed to come here to work on.
[17:12.300 --> 17:14.080]  And I said, the one next to it.
[17:14.380 --> 17:15.680]  And they went, oh, this one.
[17:15.720 --> 17:17.160]  And it hurts so much.
[17:17.400 --> 17:18.260]  They like put their fingers.
[17:19.100 --> 17:20.660]  They're like, OK, yeah, it's that one.
[17:21.240 --> 17:22.040]  Let's figure this out.
[17:23.700 --> 17:24.880]  How long were you there for?
[17:25.980 --> 17:27.880]  Uh, a little over two hours.
[17:28.540 --> 17:29.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:29.560 --> 17:31.700]  That felt like about a two hour one, as you were describing it.
[17:31.720 --> 17:32.220]  That sucks.
[17:32.420 --> 17:32.720]  Yeah.
[17:32.960 --> 17:34.380]  Oh, the only positive.
[17:34.520 --> 17:37.500]  What's nice about those experiences is I've never had a tooth crack,
[17:37.500 --> 17:41.020]  but not like fully detached from the rest of the tooth.
[17:41.280 --> 17:44.960]  So when they said like, OK, we got to extract this cracked part.
[17:44.960 --> 17:47.980]  I was like, oh, boy, that's that could be bad.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.320]  And they pulled it without me even realizing the the process had begun.
[17:53.320 --> 17:57.500]  He like did the numbing stuff and then they went in and I was like, OK,
[17:57.540 --> 17:59.680]  I guess you're like kind of going to size this up.
[17:59.840 --> 18:02.760]  And then they said, OK, so we've extracted the crack part.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.720]  And I was like, oh, that's great.
[18:05.180 --> 18:05.540]  Fantastic.
[18:05.660 --> 18:06.700]  I was kind of worried about that.
[18:06.840 --> 18:07.980]  Not a lot of resistance there.
[18:08.460 --> 18:11.200]  Yeah, just instantly, instantly gone.
[18:11.460 --> 18:13.040]  It's overall good.
[18:13.260 --> 18:14.080]  Feel a lot better today.
[18:15.120 --> 18:16.240]  Excited to be doing stuff.
[18:16.540 --> 18:18.060]  I was glad to hear that.
[18:19.020 --> 18:19.820]  I missed it.
[18:20.120 --> 18:20.840]  You sound great today.
[18:20.840 --> 18:25.720]  I, uh, I was also happy that Gavin got good kip, which is a word he used.
[18:25.780 --> 18:28.580]  I think it's the first time Gavin's ever said anything to me
[18:28.580 --> 18:31.700]  that I then had to Google to try to figure out what it meant.
[18:32.640 --> 18:33.260]  Oh, really?
[18:33.480 --> 18:33.880]  Oh, sorry.
[18:34.060 --> 18:34.920]  Kip is nap, right?
[18:35.420 --> 18:36.280]  Yeah, it's like sleep.
[18:36.540 --> 18:37.540]  It's like good quality sleep.
[18:38.460 --> 18:39.080]  Ah, I appreciate it.
[18:39.760 --> 18:40.280]  It's a good word.
[18:40.400 --> 18:40.920]  Got some good kip.
[18:41.380 --> 18:41.880]  I like kip.
[18:42.300 --> 18:43.200]  Are you going to start using it?
[18:43.520 --> 18:44.220]  I think I will.
[18:44.320 --> 18:49.920]  For some reason, my head, it resonates is like dog food is the imagery I imagine when I hear kip.
[18:49.920 --> 18:51.240]  Like, like kibble?
[18:51.620 --> 18:54.060]  Yeah, like kibble, like some dry ass dog food.
[18:54.540 --> 18:56.540]  Uh, but I like the term.
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.220]  Well, that's what my throat feels like.
[18:59.000 --> 18:59.740]  Dog food.
[19:00.920 --> 19:02.180]  Dry ass dog food.
[19:02.460 --> 19:03.480]  Try and get some kip in there.
[19:03.660 --> 19:04.020]  Oh, Christ.
[19:04.460 --> 19:05.020]  Kip it out.
[19:05.780 --> 19:08.520]  I looked at my file from the test yesterday.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.840]  And I noticed that my audio was there and everyone's audio was in it.
[19:14.040 --> 19:16.640]  And I thought, oh, well, you know, Nick was in a rush when he
[19:16.640 --> 19:20.500]  when he set up my routing through the GoXLR and all that stuff.
[19:20.640 --> 19:24.360]  And then I listened to someone else's audio and everything was there.
[19:24.480 --> 19:28.900]  And I listened to everyone's audio and everyone's audio was on everyone's file.
[19:29.260 --> 19:30.600]  I appreciate that, though.
[19:31.180 --> 19:32.800]  We're not losing any audio at that point.
[19:33.160 --> 19:34.660]  We got so much coverage.
[19:36.200 --> 19:38.180]  Everyone has everyone's backups.
[19:39.180 --> 19:42.360]  And we we established that it was it was a test.
[19:42.380 --> 19:43.700]  So it's very low stakes blame.
[19:43.700 --> 19:47.400]  But I feel like Nick really messed it all up.
[19:47.400 --> 19:48.860]  It sounds like you really want to sign blame.
[19:48.960 --> 19:50.020]  Nick, defend yourself.
[19:50.420 --> 19:51.780]  Gavin kept taking my mouse.
[19:52.640 --> 19:58.120]  Gavin did keep taking his mouse, which I will say has nothing to do
[19:58.120 --> 20:01.400]  with how we ended up with all the audio on all the tracks.
[20:01.700 --> 20:04.500]  But that is something that did happen.
[20:04.720 --> 20:06.920]  But I couldn't monitor my audio as a result.
[20:07.560 --> 20:08.960]  Well, there we go.
[20:09.340 --> 20:10.160]  Suck on that, Eric.
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.300]  That's a great defense there.
[20:11.300 --> 20:13.320]  I thought, Nick, you were just doing the classic routine
[20:13.320 --> 20:14.900]  of you're going to say something I did wrong.
[20:14.980 --> 20:16.220]  I'm going to say something you did wrong.
[20:16.360 --> 20:17.700]  Now we're both equally wrong.
[20:17.880 --> 20:21.340]  There's a whole logic behind what you just did.
[20:21.840 --> 20:22.920]  He couldn't monitor his audio.
[20:23.160 --> 20:24.140]  Eric ordered three mice.
[20:24.680 --> 20:28.880]  You can only order three mice at a time on Amazon.
[20:29.200 --> 20:31.480]  And it goes, hey, you want to order more mice?
[20:31.500 --> 20:33.340]  You actually can't do that.
[20:33.380 --> 20:37.100]  And I think Jeff had the same problem with Xboxes.
[20:37.100 --> 20:41.820]  And Xboxes and mice are not the same because one is $30.
[20:43.200 --> 20:44.740]  Give me 10 mice.
[20:44.880 --> 20:45.420]  Who cares?
[20:45.800 --> 20:49.800]  Oddly, it let me buy five capture cards all at once the other day.
[20:49.980 --> 20:50.840]  No, no problem at all.
[20:50.960 --> 20:53.460]  How are you going to use those without your mice and your Xboxes?
[20:54.420 --> 20:56.220]  It could be like a three blind mice rule.
[20:57.020 --> 20:58.000]  There's no four blind mice.
[20:58.580 --> 20:59.580]  Okay, okay.
[21:00.520 --> 21:00.960]  So...
[21:02.480 --> 21:03.500]  Can't go but three.
[21:05.600 --> 21:06.480]  What the...
[21:09.100 --> 21:11.020]  Three blind mice rule.
[21:11.240 --> 21:12.080]  Well, they don't got eyes.
[21:13.380 --> 21:16.860]  Amazon, if they can't see, if they don't have eyes on what you're using the mice for,
[21:16.920 --> 21:17.840]  they're going to limit you to three.
[21:19.700 --> 21:22.580]  When you're starting a business, it's insanely stressful.
[21:22.940 --> 21:24.980]  Feels like you're spinning 16 plates at once.
[21:25.320 --> 21:27.020]  And as you proceed, they only multiply.
[21:27.540 --> 21:30.300]  It's why I'm so thankful for an incredible service like Shopify.
[21:31.040 --> 21:33.400]  Shopify, in my opinion, is the best of what it does.
[21:33.520 --> 21:36.460]  And knowing that we will have all of the support and tools it provides
[21:36.460 --> 21:37.720]  is the best feeling.
[21:38.100 --> 21:41.420]  Shopify is the commerce platform behind millions of businesses worldwide
[21:41.420 --> 21:44.360]  and 10% of all e-commerce in the US.
[21:44.880 --> 21:48.800]  It ranges from giants like Mattel or Gymshark to brands just getting started.
[21:49.160 --> 21:53.000]  So no matter where you are in the evolution of your business, you are covered.
[21:53.440 --> 21:55.920]  With Shopify, you have access to their design studio,
[21:56.340 --> 22:00.840]  providing you with hundreds of ready-to-use templates that build your online store.
[22:01.420 --> 22:03.060]  Shopify is loaded with helpful AI tools,
[22:03.060 --> 22:06.560]  allowing you to accelerate the process of things like product descriptions,
[22:07.060 --> 22:10.020]  page headlines, and even enhance your product photography.
[22:10.560 --> 22:13.700]  Shopify allows you to easily create email and social media campaigns.
[22:14.180 --> 22:17.700]  Wherever your customers are, it's like you have a full marketing team behind you.
[22:18.020 --> 22:22.280]  And on top of all of that, Shopify is your commerce expert with world-class expertise
[22:22.280 --> 22:27.780]  from managing inventory to international shipping to processing returns and beyond.
[22:27.940 --> 22:30.140]  As a business owner who uses Shopify,
[22:30.140 --> 22:32.940]  I don't want to imagine navigating those things without it.
[22:33.280 --> 22:35.500]  If you're ready to sell, you're ready for Shopify.
[22:36.120 --> 22:38.920]  What I love about Shopify is no matter how big you want to grow,
[22:39.420 --> 22:43.640]  Shopify gives you everything you need to take control and take your business to the next level.
[22:43.920 --> 22:45.720]  Or even if you're happy with the level you're at,
[22:46.020 --> 22:49.980]  it's just a relief as a business owner to know you are in great hands.
[22:50.640 --> 22:52.300]  Turn your big business idea into...
[22:53.020 --> 22:54.800]  with Shopify on your side.
[23:08.120 --> 23:09.920]  Well, summer's officially here.
[23:10.080 --> 23:10.800]  You know what that means.
[23:11.020 --> 23:17.020]  More sun, more sunlight, more time to do all the things outside that make summer
[23:17.020 --> 23:20.800]  so special and make living in cold climates during the winter worth it.
[23:21.120 --> 23:24.160]  And the number one thing you don't want to do this summer?
[23:24.160 --> 23:27.240]  Spend all day in the kitchen cooking.

[25:00.780 --> 25:02.960]  The cool thing about The Office,
[25:03.300 --> 25:05.020]  if we're still talking about it a little bit,
[25:05.100 --> 25:08.260]  is Gavin has done some technical wizardry
[25:08.260 --> 25:12.700]  where our download speed and upload speed is out of control.
[25:12.920 --> 25:13.940]  It's so...
[25:13.940 --> 25:17.280]  We downloaded Grand Theft Auto in like four minutes.
[25:17.280 --> 25:20.860]  It took so long to install, but the download was so fast.
[25:20.960 --> 25:22.300]  It was like, it made my head spin.
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.740]  It was maxed, like 980 down, 980 megs down or so.
[25:27.020 --> 25:28.340]  It's less to do with anything I did.
[25:28.380 --> 25:30.220]  It was just more about the internet that you ordered.
[25:31.160 --> 25:33.720]  Well, when I ordered the internet, the guy was like,
[25:33.840 --> 25:35.260]  why do you need this much speed?
[25:35.400 --> 25:37.960]  And I went, oh, we're going to be like doing business out of here or whatever.
[25:38.000 --> 25:38.760]  And he's like, okay.
[25:38.820 --> 25:40.640]  I mean, usually I just tell my customers,
[25:40.760 --> 25:42.080]  you probably don't need this much.
[25:42.140 --> 25:45.400]  And I went, I appreciate it, but we do.
[25:45.640 --> 25:46.740]  So we'll take it.
[25:46.740 --> 25:49.600]  This guy's never had four people downloading GTA
[25:49.600 --> 25:51.640]  all at a gigabit at the same time.
[25:51.940 --> 25:52.400]  Right.
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.300]  And then he's also, he's also never had them all record their audio on one track,
[25:56.720 --> 25:58.020]  one place for a test.
[25:58.100 --> 25:59.920]  But that's here, neither here nor there.
[26:00.420 --> 26:03.000]  We were playing like four gigabits just on GTA yesterday.
[26:04.160 --> 26:05.740]  Gavin says it has nothing to do with him.
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.340]  But the second the internet got installed, he went in,
[26:08.680 --> 26:11.300]  uninstalled the modem and the router that they gave us,
[26:11.480 --> 26:15.300]  put his own in, brought in some sort of a rack system with...
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.260]  green and blue lights going that indicate things that I don't understand.
[26:20.440 --> 26:22.340]  That's way more complicated than anything I've ever seen.
[26:22.520 --> 26:24.740]  He's got ethernet cables running to our...
[26:25.240 --> 26:26.780]  the system where these cables...
[26:26.780 --> 26:28.860]  it's the smallest cable I've ever seen in my entire life.
[26:28.920 --> 26:32.220]  It's thinner than like an iPhone head headphone cable.
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.160]  And I don't recognize any of the technology that Gavin used.
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.860]  And it's, there's no way it's not all on Google.
[26:41.120 --> 26:42.160]  Gavin, you did some work there.
[26:42.500 --> 26:43.140]  Yeah, I did some research.
[26:43.320 --> 26:46.080]  It's actually the same, the same sort of stuff that we had at Recetteve.
[26:46.080 --> 26:48.260]  But it just means that we can remotely...
[26:48.260 --> 26:50.180]  fix problems without having to go there.
[26:50.560 --> 26:52.660]  Also, our internet was never that good at Recetteve.
[26:52.680 --> 26:53.420]  So once again...
[26:53.420 --> 26:54.870]  Oh no, it was all like limited and...
[26:55.800 --> 26:57.620]  Yeah, we're unlimited here at our office.
[26:58.040 --> 27:00.840]  And now, and now we have a place to put all of our files.
[27:01.020 --> 27:03.820]  So like, it doesn't even, it makes even less sense for you to have strikes now, right?
[27:04.340 --> 27:05.580]  Well, I was going to say...
[27:06.800 --> 27:09.400]  that was maybe the best laugh I had yesterday.
[27:09.780 --> 27:12.160]  Unexpected laugh was Gavin in the Slack,
[27:12.300 --> 27:15.300]  posted a giant thing about how he optimized uploading.
[27:15.300 --> 27:19.540]  And of all the people to optimize uploading, that was hilarious.
[27:22.540 --> 27:24.200]  That made me really happy.
[27:25.160 --> 27:28.940]  I read this very technical long thing of like,
[27:28.980 --> 27:30.800]  yeah, now we can upload from home and it's great.
[27:30.900 --> 27:32.960]  And it's like, okay, we upload it all.
[27:33.440 --> 27:35.720]  But first, let's just get in a basic upload going.
[27:37.700 --> 27:40.180]  The next phase of it is I'm going to set everyone's
[27:40.180 --> 27:43.120]  capture folder to be like watch folders for the raid.
[27:43.180 --> 27:45.220]  So it just sucks everything onto it.
[27:45.300 --> 27:46.760]  Without you having to press anything.
[27:48.480 --> 27:52.460]  I am imagining with everybody's track,
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.440]  everyone having everything in every track.
[27:54.760 --> 27:59.020]  I think it's always so cool when somebody deconstructs a song,
[27:59.080 --> 28:01.420]  like a music producer, like only plays the drums.
[28:01.860 --> 28:04.300]  That would not translate to what you guys just did.
[28:05.160 --> 28:07.680]  Just listening to like Gavin's track and be like,
[28:07.700 --> 28:09.700]  okay, now let's just let's just zone in on this.
[28:09.760 --> 28:10.800]  Let's see what's going on here.
[28:10.900 --> 28:12.000]  Isolate it, isolate Gavin.
[28:12.060 --> 28:13.180]  Let's isolate this.
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.900]  It really doesn't add anything to that setup.
[28:17.540 --> 28:18.860]  The same way with music.
[28:19.160 --> 28:20.460]  I think that's so cool.
[28:21.140 --> 28:23.160]  Anytime there is isolation of a song,
[28:23.460 --> 28:26.700]  especially with like hip hop of like learning what the
[28:27.520 --> 28:28.880]  tracks are being pulled from.
[28:29.320 --> 28:29.740]  It's awesome.
[28:30.240 --> 28:31.240]  Doesn't apply to Let's Play.
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.600]  There was that documentary series that Rick Rubin did with Paul McCartney,
[28:36.740 --> 28:40.720]  where he isolated tracks and instruments and stuff on Beatles songs.
[28:40.720 --> 28:43.380]  And it was it was the wildest thing I've ever heard.
[28:43.460 --> 28:44.340]  It was really fascinating.
[28:44.740 --> 28:47.080]  Definitely wouldn't get that from anything we do.
[28:47.680 --> 28:51.540]  I wonder if you could tell what video game was being played.
[28:51.900 --> 28:53.420]  How long that would...
[28:53.420 --> 28:55.420]  Maybe that's like a competition we could do at some point,
[28:55.520 --> 28:56.960]  where it's games that we've all played,
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.840]  and then how long it takes each of us to register what that game is.
[29:01.840 --> 29:02.520]  And if it's accurate.
[29:02.620 --> 29:05.000]  Or maybe we do like a blind Let's Play someday,
[29:05.200 --> 29:08.600]  where it's just audio and we don't say what the game is
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.280]  and the audience has to figure it out.
[29:10.280 --> 29:11.840]  And if they get it right, we'll give them some.
[29:12.100 --> 29:13.280]  We'll let the audience do the work.
[29:13.620 --> 29:13.760]  Yeah.
[29:14.680 --> 29:17.000]  But Gavin and I were talking about this recently,
[29:17.140 --> 29:25.000]  of that humans are terrible at recognizing what things sound like based on movies and TV.
[29:25.660 --> 29:29.520]  Like, I feel like I'll see like a horse walking in a show
[29:29.520 --> 29:31.220]  and then you'll see what they used.
[29:31.240 --> 29:34.140]  And it's like cabbage pushed against the garbage can lid.
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.280]  Like nothing sounds like it should.
[29:37.840 --> 29:41.380]  Like the ability to recognize what these things actually are.
[29:41.800 --> 29:43.580]  It'd be fun for us maybe to do that.
[29:43.640 --> 29:45.680]  Maybe do our own sound effect type work.
[29:46.320 --> 29:47.200]  Our own foley work?
[29:47.460 --> 29:48.600]  Our own foley work.
[29:49.640 --> 29:53.080]  I want to see a show where a guy walks out of a saloon
[29:53.080 --> 29:55.020]  and hops onto some cabbage and...
[29:56.940 --> 29:59.260]  Well, the sound they use for him hopping on cabbage,
[29:59.380 --> 30:01.820]  actually cactus getting hit by baseball bats.
[30:03.380 --> 30:04.240]  Completely different.
[30:07.620 --> 30:10.080]  I had a weird thought the other night.
[30:10.440 --> 30:11.160]  But do you think...
[30:11.720 --> 30:12.300]  Yeah, in bed.
[30:12.460 --> 30:13.680]  It was specifically in bed.
[30:13.760 --> 30:14.340]  It was a bed thought.
[30:14.900 --> 30:15.480]  I was thinking,
[30:16.040 --> 30:19.120]  if somebody stole your cheeks while you're sleeping,
[30:19.500 --> 30:20.000]  your butt cheeks,
[30:20.760 --> 30:22.580]  how long do you think it would take for you to nap?
[30:24.220 --> 30:24.660]  Instantly.
[30:25.200 --> 30:25.640]  Really?
[30:26.320 --> 30:26.760]  Instantly.
[30:27.120 --> 30:29.700]  You'd roll over onto your butt and it'd be gone.
[30:29.840 --> 30:30.220]  No, no, no, no.
[30:30.240 --> 30:31.200]  You'd instantly wake up.
[30:31.260 --> 30:32.360]  The Indiana Jones it.
[30:32.640 --> 30:35.660]  So they steal your cheeks, put other cheeks in.
[30:36.160 --> 30:37.640]  I don't think I would notice.
[30:37.880 --> 30:38.600]  Wait, you're talking about your face?
[30:39.060 --> 30:39.840]  No, butt cheeks.
[30:40.460 --> 30:43.140]  Face cheeks I would notice because I see my face regularly.
[30:43.680 --> 30:45.860]  I was thinking about how rarely I look at my butt
[30:45.860 --> 30:48.560]  and I don't think I notice a feel difference.
[30:49.240 --> 30:51.900]  If somebody like kind of tried to Indiana Jones it,
[30:52.040 --> 30:54.120]  like obviously if it was completely different,
[30:54.260 --> 30:55.560]  then I think I would notice.
[30:55.960 --> 30:58.120]  But if it was relatively the same...
[30:58.120 --> 31:00.060]  I noticed my butt way before my face.
[31:00.380 --> 31:00.880]  You shitting me?
[31:01.240 --> 31:01.520]  Really?
[31:02.160 --> 31:03.960]  Yeah, I sit down more than I look in the mirror.
[31:03.960 --> 31:05.940]  Yeah, but you've got new butt cheeks.
[31:06.080 --> 31:07.660]  They're just different butt cheeks.
[31:08.360 --> 31:13.260]  I don't think like the butt cheek experience changes all that much.
[31:13.420 --> 31:15.640]  I think the second I touched my butt, I would know.
[31:15.860 --> 31:17.080]  I would know that that wasn't my butt.
[31:17.340 --> 31:19.320]  Because everyone has different firmness of butt.
[31:19.420 --> 31:20.780]  How often are you touching your butt?
[31:21.260 --> 31:22.640]  I mean, I don't know.
[31:22.840 --> 31:24.460]  At least once a day.
[31:25.200 --> 31:25.640]  I guess.
[31:25.700 --> 31:26.340]  Yeah, I guess.
[31:26.560 --> 31:31.900]  But I feel like there's so much other stuff going on with like a wiping situation.
[31:31.900 --> 31:34.140]  Like I'm just sitting on my butt right now.
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.960]  And I'm aware of my butt and all kinds of stuff about my butt.
[31:38.020 --> 31:40.060]  But I just don't think it would be that different.
[31:40.160 --> 31:43.360]  If I sat anywhere too long and thought about it, I'd be like, well, this seat's uncomfortable.
[31:43.800 --> 31:44.980]  Why does the seat feel weird?
[31:45.060 --> 31:46.120]  It feels different than it did yesterday.
[31:46.300 --> 31:48.060]  And I, well, everything's a little different.
[31:48.100 --> 31:50.980]  And then you start touching and you're like, holy shit, this is somebody else's ass.
[31:51.300 --> 31:53.360]  I know my butt in so many different ways.
[31:53.380 --> 31:55.360]  Like I know its level of cushioning.
[31:55.400 --> 31:56.440]  I know how it clenches.
[31:56.780 --> 32:00.780]  I feel like if I was to like swap butts with Nick, I would be able to know immediately.
[32:00.780 --> 32:03.160]  Because Nick's someone who does way more exercise.
[32:03.960 --> 32:04.320]  Interesting.
[32:04.460 --> 32:07.180]  Yeah. Plus like the second I took a dump, I'd know.
[32:08.640 --> 32:09.500]  I, yeah.
[32:09.580 --> 32:12.540]  Like if you poop through a different butt, you're going to know.
[32:12.580 --> 32:15.000]  And I spent a lot of time on the toilet doing that, you know?
[32:16.220 --> 32:17.740]  But the anus would be the same.
[32:18.080 --> 32:21.120]  Yeah. I don't think it would be as different as you feel.
[32:21.160 --> 32:22.720]  Yeah. But the vessel's different, man.
[32:22.760 --> 32:26.340]  The thing you're sitting on, it's going to, there's going to be subtle differences.
[32:26.720 --> 32:30.600]  And the toilet is an exacting and harsh thing to sit on.
[32:30.600 --> 32:32.300]  You're going to feel the difference immediately.
[32:32.500 --> 32:34.820]  It would have like a different, different sleep number.
[32:35.480 --> 32:36.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[32:36.160 --> 32:36.680]  You think so?
[32:36.760 --> 32:37.940]  Your butt would have a different sleep number.
[32:38.340 --> 32:41.960]  That's the problem. I've never, I've never sat with another man's cheeks,
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.520]  but I feel like the experience is probably pretty similar.
[32:47.160 --> 32:49.380]  I don't think there's a wide range of feeling.
[32:49.760 --> 32:53.020]  I think maybe size and shape, there could be a difference.
[32:53.080 --> 32:57.520]  But as far as like sitting, I imagine sitting is kind of a universal feeling.
[32:57.980 --> 32:58.980]  I could be wrong.
[32:58.980 --> 33:03.020]  If you swap with someone who had a different sized butt, it would feel different.
[33:03.620 --> 33:04.220]  I guess.
[33:04.660 --> 33:08.020]  I also just think that like even the angle of your sit would be different
[33:08.020 --> 33:09.920]  because the butt would be subtly different.
[33:10.080 --> 33:12.320]  There'd be, you'd be, you'd feel like you're on the piss all the time.
[33:12.400 --> 33:14.560]  Like everything would just be a little askew, you know?
[33:14.940 --> 33:17.500]  Like it wouldn't, it wouldn't quite fit in the same way.
[33:17.840 --> 33:21.140]  Maybe this is a specific to me issue.
[33:21.660 --> 33:25.640]  Because I think I would just realize, like things would be slightly off.
[33:25.760 --> 33:27.860]  And then I just, I wouldn't really flag it.
[33:27.860 --> 33:30.940]  But I would start adjusting and then I just have a new way to sit.
[33:31.180 --> 33:32.860]  And I would have gone unnoticed.
[33:33.080 --> 33:36.900]  So you would just sit differently before you investigated your butt
[33:36.900 --> 33:38.960]  any further and think maybe I've got a different butt.
[33:39.560 --> 33:39.840]  Yes.
[33:41.560 --> 33:45.820]  My initial response to a problem typically is let's solve this problem.
[33:46.020 --> 33:48.040]  And not necessarily what's the cause of it.
[33:48.500 --> 33:49.520]  I think I'd solve it.
[33:49.780 --> 33:51.160]  Then I would move on.
[33:51.420 --> 33:54.600]  And then maybe like a calendar year later, somehow go,
[33:54.600 --> 33:56.720]  Oh, what happened?
[33:57.380 --> 33:58.520]  When did this happen?
[33:59.300 --> 34:02.140]  Yeah, you're like a patch the holes kind of guy as opposed to a...
[34:02.140 --> 34:02.580]  Total, well...
[34:03.140 --> 34:04.460]  Let's figure the source of the problem.
[34:04.940 --> 34:05.580]  I get, yeah.
[34:05.800 --> 34:08.640]  Like as long as I don't, as long as this is a scenario
[34:08.640 --> 34:11.820]  in which the problem isn't going to get worse by whatever I'm patching.
[34:12.300 --> 34:17.500]  If it's a, this doesn't actually solve it, then that'll change my approach to it.
[34:17.540 --> 34:20.960]  But if it's like a thing of discomfort, then yeah, I just adjust.
[34:21.300 --> 34:22.360]  I wouldn't think about it.
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.740]  If you and I swapped butts, I would be texting you within 20 seconds being like,
[34:27.020 --> 34:28.080]  Hey, do you have my butt?
[34:28.200 --> 34:30.880]  And it sounds like you would wait at least a year before saying anything.
[34:31.520 --> 34:33.620]  I think I'd be like, I don't know, do I?
[34:34.740 --> 34:35.560]  I guess I do.
[34:37.500 --> 34:38.440]  I don't notice.
[34:41.420 --> 34:43.260]  Oh, I'm shitting totally differently.
[34:43.760 --> 34:44.520]  This is crazy.
[34:44.640 --> 34:45.380]  I definitely do.
[34:46.300 --> 34:47.400]  Farts would probably sound different.
[34:48.060 --> 34:49.460]  That'd probably be the weirdest thing.
[34:49.560 --> 34:50.700]  Oh my God, definitely.
[34:51.340 --> 34:51.580]  Definitely.
[34:51.580 --> 34:53.480]  I guess that would maybe be the giveaway.
[34:54.320 --> 35:00.460]  I think the reason my farts are so shit is that all of my fart takes place at the anus
[35:00.460 --> 35:02.040]  and none of it takes place in the cheeks.
[35:03.120 --> 35:08.320]  Where I feel like if you've got like a, if you've got more fleshy ass, it's also working
[35:08.320 --> 35:14.340]  through the, through the cheeks to give some reverb and some, maybe some bass on each fart.
[35:15.820 --> 35:20.200]  I feel like the sound is diffused through multiple layers of hair with you as well.
[35:20.700 --> 35:22.520]  Oh, and there's definitely a muffled effect.
[35:23.120 --> 35:28.580]  Jeff, imagine how happy you would be if we had like Mr. Potato Head bodies where you
[35:28.580 --> 35:33.800]  just pop things in and out that you could go out and get an ass just for farting.
[35:34.220 --> 35:35.920]  The optimal fart ass.
[35:36.940 --> 35:39.540]  I would like an ass for long bicycle rides.
[35:39.660 --> 35:40.520]  That's the ass I want.
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.500]  What you just propositioned, Andrew, sounds like to me more than anyone else, that would
[35:46.500 --> 35:49.500]  be like Jeff's dream is just like, let me pop these ears off.
[35:51.700 --> 35:54.520]  I'm doing like crazy mouth today.
[35:54.680 --> 35:56.980]  Like I think Jeff, I think Jeff would be loving it.
[35:57.220 --> 35:57.540]  Oh yeah.
[35:57.540 --> 35:57.980]  Are you kidding?
[35:58.120 --> 36:01.820]  I can imagine picking up all Jeff's shit off the floor and putting it on my body and then
[36:01.820 --> 36:02.940]  just being in pain.
[36:07.180 --> 36:08.600]  What's this spying about?
[36:08.760 --> 36:09.460]  Oh, it hurts.
[36:09.460 --> 36:10.840]  Oh yeah, it's not good.
[36:12.900 --> 36:16.640]  There's a lot of pain wrapped around this 49 year old body.
[36:17.340 --> 36:18.040]  Oh God.
[36:18.240 --> 36:21.180]  Hey, speaking of pain, can I tell you guys a dumb thing I did?
[36:21.420 --> 36:21.840]  Please.
[36:22.940 --> 36:28.020]  You guys remember a couple of years ago when I was in my smoothie era, I unintentionally
[36:28.020 --> 36:29.540]  created something called the Purple Nightmare.
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.620]  It actually made it into our f***face cookbook, which is still available to this day digitally
[36:35.180 --> 36:38.300]  on our Patreon or for free if you sign up, right?
[36:38.300 --> 36:40.080]  I think it's a gimme.
[36:40.640 --> 36:40.940]  That's right.
[36:41.520 --> 36:42.160]  If you're a paid member.
[36:42.420 --> 36:44.800]  Was the Purple Nightmare the one that you spilled everywhere?
[36:45.180 --> 36:47.240]  Was that the initial one or was that a different smoothie?
[36:47.700 --> 36:48.580]  No, that's the one.
[36:48.660 --> 36:51.800]  It was the smoothie that I was making for Millie that just fell out of my hands.
[36:52.020 --> 36:53.440]  And when it hit the ground, it exploded.
[36:53.660 --> 36:58.880]  And it was on the ceiling and the walls and behind the curtains and on the other side
[36:58.880 --> 36:59.200]  of the...
[36:59.200 --> 37:03.000]  It went outside like a f***ing James McAvoy bullet.
[37:03.180 --> 37:06.300]  And it went outside and took a turn and came back and got splattered on the other side
[37:06.300 --> 37:07.180]  of the window somehow.
[37:07.180 --> 37:09.560]  Referencing that movie Wanted, obviously.
[37:12.580 --> 37:20.720]  And anyway, I unintentionally for 2025 updated the recipe and I'm a little bummed about it
[37:20.720 --> 37:22.380]  because it is f***ing annoying.
[37:22.580 --> 37:28.260]  The other night, I opened my fridge just to get a Vernors, a Diet Vernors soda.
[37:29.060 --> 37:34.000]  And when I shut the fridge, it like pushed back on me for a second and I heard a crack
[37:34.620 --> 37:35.240]  and a little...
[37:35.640 --> 37:36.760]  And I thought, that's weird.
[37:36.760 --> 37:39.900]  I opened it back up and I guess what had happened...
[37:39.900 --> 37:47.260]  See, what had happened was somehow a big canister of bacon bits got dislodged from the door
[37:47.260 --> 37:49.200]  and it fell.
[37:49.620 --> 37:53.260]  You know, like the bacon bits that are hard and crunchy and that are like kind of like
[37:53.260 --> 37:55.960]  an impossible color of red to be real food.
[37:56.440 --> 37:57.160]  Kind of a purple...
[37:57.160 --> 37:57.320]  Yeah.
[37:57.500 --> 37:57.980]  Yeah.
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.160]  Bacon bits, right?
[37:59.680 --> 38:00.060]  Thank you, Nick.
[38:00.480 --> 38:03.080]  And it was about three quarters full.
[38:03.080 --> 38:04.480]  And so it got...
[38:04.480 --> 38:10.820]  When I shut the door, it fell and it landed just as such that the door cracked it and it
[38:10.820 --> 38:11.440]  exploded.
[38:11.940 --> 38:12.440]  Bacon bits.
[38:14.360 --> 38:15.380]  And it was a nightmare.
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.340]  My entire fridge was instantly covered in bacon bit glitter.
[38:21.280 --> 38:28.560]  It was unbelievably, unbelievably destructive, right?
[38:28.600 --> 38:32.200]  So I open it up and I'm just kind of looking at it and there's bacon bits all over the ground
[38:32.660 --> 38:35.040]  and I'm just like, oh, I can't fucking believe this.
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.020]  And Millie and her boyfriend and Emily are in the kitchen laughing at me going like,
[38:40.080 --> 38:40.640]  what happened?
[38:40.700 --> 38:41.800]  And I'm like, I don't know.
[38:41.880 --> 38:42.840]  It was a bacon bit explosion.
[38:43.420 --> 38:46.480]  And so I grab a broom and I start just trying to sweep up the bacon bits off the ground
[38:46.480 --> 38:47.500]  and I put them into a pile.
[38:47.900 --> 38:50.820]  And then I look and I realize they're on every shelf, right?
[38:50.840 --> 38:54.100]  So I just start taking stuff out and putting it on the kitchen counter and cleaning out
[38:54.100 --> 38:54.500]  the shelves.
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.920]  And the worst concentration of bacon bits is obviously at the bottom, right?
[38:58.920 --> 38:59.520]  Because of gravity.
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.820]  So I go to take the bottom, like the veggie crisper out.
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.720]  And in this fucking fridge that I don't own because I rent, it does not come out.
[39:09.780 --> 39:11.240]  It's the only one that doesn't come out.
[39:12.060 --> 39:14.300]  But it's also, it's a veggie crisper, right?
[39:14.360 --> 39:15.540]  So it's clear plastic.
[39:15.660 --> 39:19.840]  So you can see right through it to the bottom and back of the fridge where all there are
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.220]  is like 1,000 bacon bits.
[39:21.340 --> 39:22.760]  It is hideous and it's disgusting.
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.620]  And I'm like fighting with it and wrestling.
[39:24.740 --> 39:26.620]  And I think like, I'm just, I'll just break it and put a new one in.
[39:26.660 --> 39:27.640]  And I'm like, that's, I'm not going to do that.
[39:27.640 --> 39:32.440]  And then Emily or Millie or somebody said, it's too bad you don't have a way to blow
[39:32.440 --> 39:32.780]  it out.
[39:33.080 --> 39:36.180]  And I thought, oh, I do have a way to blow it out.
[39:36.780 --> 39:40.040]  And this is where I made a tactical error.
[39:40.320 --> 39:43.220]  I went into the backyard and I grabbed my leaf blower.
[39:45.680 --> 39:47.000]  It's the first thing I thought of.
[39:47.060 --> 39:51.800]  So I stuck the leaf blower in the bottom of the, in the corner of the fridge and I ram
[39:51.800 --> 39:52.520]  jammed it, right?
[39:52.940 --> 39:54.020]  There's nothing tactical.
[39:54.200 --> 39:55.920]  There's nothing tactical about this.
[39:55.920 --> 40:01.800]  And it worked, it worked too well because I got hit with stinging bacon bits in the
[40:01.800 --> 40:02.160]  face.
[40:02.160 --> 40:08.480]  And I hear Millie coughing in the background and I turn around and Millie and her boyfriend
[40:08.480 --> 40:13.180]  and Emily and the kitchen counter and the rest of the house are now covered in bacon
[40:13.180 --> 40:13.460]  bits.
[40:13.880 --> 40:20.680]  I tattooed the house with bacon bits, just from that quick little two second pump from
[40:20.680 --> 40:21.280]  the leaf blower.
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.040]  And it didn't entirely get all the bacon bits out of the fridge.
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.460]  I still had about 20 minutes of work there getting the rest of the bacon bits out of
[40:29.460 --> 40:29.660]  the fridge.
[40:29.740 --> 40:33.020]  But now, now there are just bacon bits all over my house.
[40:33.400 --> 40:37.980]  Like all day long, I step on a bacon bit or I move a pot and there's bacon bits behind
[40:37.980 --> 40:38.280]  it.
[40:38.420 --> 40:41.960]  Or there's a bacon bit on my Xbox controller in the other room.
[40:42.100 --> 40:42.740]  Like how did that happen?
[40:43.100 --> 40:52.380]  I somehow put, I don't know, 100,000 bacon bits into play in my house, the first floor
[40:52.380 --> 40:52.740]  of my house.
[40:52.740 --> 40:58.860]  And, uh, realized that may be one of the dumber things I've done in the last decade or so.
[40:59.220 --> 41:02.940]  I bet taking the, the bottle and just drop kicking it in the kitchen would have made
[41:02.940 --> 41:03.740]  less mess.
[41:04.180 --> 41:04.440]  Yeah.
[41:04.700 --> 41:11.160]  I mean, it was, it was a mess in that was at least contained to the floor and the fridge
[41:11.160 --> 41:15.640]  until I brought the, the leaf blower in to the mix.
[41:15.780 --> 41:18.600]  Why did they suggest a blow instead of a suck?
[41:19.060 --> 41:20.840]  Uh, they did suggest a suck.
[41:20.980 --> 41:21.860]  Maybe you're a blow.
[41:22.000 --> 41:22.480]  I don't know.
[41:22.480 --> 41:24.480]  They were just like, it's a better way to get, maybe I don't remember.
[41:24.620 --> 41:28.480]  They might've said like a, but we don't have like a, like a shop vac or anything.
[41:28.580 --> 41:30.060]  And I thought I'd just blow it out the end.
[41:30.120 --> 41:33.420]  So, you know, like, and it was just in the heat of the bee, Gavin.
[41:34.420 --> 41:37.780]  Bee day was occurring and he just had to respond.
[41:38.340 --> 41:41.260]  This to me sounds like the greatest thing that's ever happened to Albert.
[41:41.940 --> 41:44.960]  Albert's is going to be walking around that house getting free bacon all day.
[41:45.520 --> 41:46.520]  He's getting his little bits.
[41:46.640 --> 41:46.780]  Yeah.
[41:46.880 --> 41:52.460]  I, I assume that anything from like bulldog neck down in the house is clean, but I'm
[41:52.460 --> 41:55.440]  finding bacon bits everywhere, dude.
[41:55.500 --> 41:57.120]  They're like in the cracks of the sofa.
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.180]  It's like, they went airborne and just covered the house.
[42:04.060 --> 42:04.720]  Raise the rudders.
[42:05.000 --> 42:05.960]  Raise the sails.
[42:06.100 --> 42:07.120]  Raise the sails.
[42:07.560 --> 42:09.700]  Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching.
[42:10.000 --> 42:10.200]  Over.
[42:10.680 --> 42:11.020]  Roger.

[42:36.600 --> 42:39.480]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[42:39.620 --> 42:43.180]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[42:43.540 --> 42:45.020]  Available for a limited time.
[42:45.280 --> 42:47.420]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[42:47.420 --> 42:53.780]  I think of all the bits, of all the meat bits, I think bacon is the best one that could have
[42:53.780 --> 42:57.040]  occurred with. So you have that going for you.
[42:57.180 --> 43:00.960]  Bacon bits are so overrated. They sound so much better than they are.
[43:01.200 --> 43:02.180]  Oh, I disagree.
[43:03.040 --> 43:03.200]  Yeah.
[43:03.380 --> 43:04.340]  I disagree as well.
[43:04.780 --> 43:08.400]  I love bacon. I just don't, I don't appreciate the the bits format for bacon.
[43:08.900 --> 43:09.580]  They just go everywhere.
[43:09.600 --> 43:10.520]  On a baked potato.
[43:10.700 --> 43:11.320]  They do.
[43:11.620 --> 43:11.740]  Contain them.
[43:11.880 --> 43:13.000]  They go everywhere, everywhere.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.900]  If you sprinkle 100 bits in a sandwich, you're getting like 80 bits in a sandwich.
[43:17.920 --> 43:19.020]  Why are you putting bits in a sandwich?
[43:19.020 --> 43:21.860]  Why would you put bacon bits on a sandwich, you lunatic?
[43:22.080 --> 43:23.680]  They're for salad and baked potatoes.
[43:24.300 --> 43:26.160]  I'm trying to think of where I've had bacon bits before.
[43:26.260 --> 43:28.600]  I was coming in to agree with Gavin, then he said that,
[43:28.720 --> 43:31.260]  and now I don't really feel like agreeing with Gavin.
[43:31.440 --> 43:33.700]  So wait, they're never used in sandwiches?
[43:34.580 --> 43:34.980]  No.
[43:35.460 --> 43:37.160]  What? No, bacon is used in sandwiches.
[43:38.080 --> 43:39.620]  I swear that's where I've seen them.
[43:40.800 --> 43:41.940]  How would you even...
[43:41.940 --> 43:42.600]  That's bacon.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.300]  Would it be like a salad or like on mashed potatoes or something?
[43:46.440 --> 43:49.020]  Like you'd throw them on stuff where they would like hang out.
[43:50.640 --> 43:55.160]  I'm just imagining somebody pouring bacon bits onto a sandwich,
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.040]  like into a sandwich that they're making.
[43:57.240 --> 44:01.400]  And there's nothing I think more psychotic you could do in the sandwich making realm.
[44:01.960 --> 44:03.480]  Just covering it in bits.
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.320]  I swear I've had that at a restaurant.
[44:05.920 --> 44:08.860]  I much prefer a full slice of bacon.
[44:09.020 --> 44:10.880]  I'm a, you know, bacon, big bacon buddy guy.
[44:12.880 --> 44:15.240]  Yeah, I think that was just a shit restaurant.
[44:15.380 --> 44:17.140]  I don't think you could blame the bits on that.
[44:17.240 --> 44:18.280]  I think that's user error.
[44:18.640 --> 44:19.000]  Yeah.
[44:19.680 --> 44:19.900]  Yeah.
[44:20.480 --> 44:21.140]  That's on you.
[44:21.320 --> 44:24.060]  Maybe we should all make salads around Jeff's fridge
[44:24.060 --> 44:28.820]  and then he should blast the bits out into the room and see who gets the most bits.
[44:29.660 --> 44:31.300]  Okay, well, we have an office.
[44:31.480 --> 44:34.860]  Yeah, I was about to say I don't want to do this because it's not at Jeff's house anymore.
[44:35.000 --> 44:35.840]  It's at our office.
[44:36.180 --> 44:39.100]  I don't know. I feel like maybe we need Jeff's crisper specifically for the...
[44:39.100 --> 44:41.260]  Oh, okay. I agree with Gavin again.
[44:41.560 --> 44:47.380]  I do like the idea of inventing a tool to, I don't know,
[44:47.740 --> 44:50.900]  improve bacon bit distribution, like a bacon blaster.
[44:51.480 --> 44:52.540]  A bacon bit blaster?
[44:52.700 --> 44:56.320]  Bacon bit blaster that we could blast onto our salads and our baked potatoes and stuff.
[44:56.600 --> 44:59.080]  Like maybe we could get into the lab and invent whatever that is.
[44:59.280 --> 45:02.220]  You know those salt guns that like...
[45:02.220 --> 45:03.360]  Yeah, a buck of salt.
[45:03.760 --> 45:08.620]  Yeah, yeah. I wonder if we made bacon bits small enough we could do that.
[45:09.580 --> 45:13.220]  And then put bacon bits inside of the bug assault gun.
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.020]  Something's gonna get real gummed up. We should definitely do this.
[45:18.260 --> 45:19.140]  Yes, we gotta do this.
[45:19.420 --> 45:21.740]  Okay. Jeff, do you want me to put it on the idea thing or you want to?
[45:21.840 --> 45:22.820]  No, if you wouldn't mind.
[45:23.020 --> 45:26.560]  I got it. Yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna bacon bits bug assault and...
[45:27.360 --> 45:28.180]  Yeah, we got it.
[45:28.300 --> 45:30.580]  Can I also try and make my own bacon blaster?
[45:31.540 --> 45:34.460]  Absolutely. Gavin, I would be offended if you didn't.
[45:34.860 --> 45:38.080]  I think mine's gonna be... mine's gonna involve a paintball gun
[45:38.640 --> 45:39.980]  and a very sharp...
[45:39.980 --> 45:40.720]  I can't wait.
[45:40.820 --> 45:42.080]  ...grid of wire at the end.
[45:43.900 --> 45:44.400]  What?
[45:45.020 --> 45:45.820]  You need a sharp grid of wire.
[45:46.120 --> 45:47.560]  Like in the Resident Evil movie?
[45:48.240 --> 45:51.400]  Yeah, yeah. It's gonna like Colin Salmon the bacon.
[45:53.360 --> 45:55.740]  Oh, I was thinking like bacon retrieval.
[45:56.380 --> 45:59.580]  Like blast the bacon out and then you could pull it back in somehow.
[46:00.280 --> 46:01.820]  And then fire again.
[46:02.040 --> 46:03.700]  You know, we can make that grid pretty easily.
[46:04.360 --> 46:06.000]  Pull the bacon back in?
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.400]  I thought it was like the wire was connected to the bit.
[46:09.740 --> 46:13.680]  And so you shoot the bit and then you retract the wire back to the gun.
[46:13.920 --> 46:15.100]  So you have an incident.
[46:15.380 --> 46:17.160]  So it's just for like luring people?
[46:17.700 --> 46:18.580]  Like a taser?
[46:18.580 --> 46:20.300]  People trying to chase a piece of bacon.
[46:20.700 --> 46:21.960]  Tricking men and dogs.
[46:24.560 --> 46:26.840]  The women are fine though. They'll ignore the bacon.
[46:27.080 --> 46:29.900]  Yeah, they know it's a trick. They know it's a trick. They're smarter than that.
[46:29.980 --> 46:30.960]  Women don't fall for bacon.
[46:32.260 --> 46:34.480]  Oh man, it's too bad that Doom just came out.
[46:34.480 --> 46:36.460]  Because this is... you send them an idea.
[46:36.800 --> 46:39.020]  They have the BFG, now they got the BBB.
[46:39.660 --> 46:45.280]  Yeah, this will get a mod going for the new Doom to put the bacon bit blaster in it.
[46:45.340 --> 46:49.120]  But then also we need someone to mod all the MILFs into Last of Us 2.
[46:49.520 --> 46:50.380]  We already have two mods.
[46:50.660 --> 46:55.260]  Who knew that in 2025 regulation was going to need a professional modder on staff?
[46:56.060 --> 46:59.940]  Can you imagine you're sitting at like a fancy-ish kind of restaurant?
[47:00.280 --> 47:02.280]  You order a dish. It has a baked potato.
[47:02.840 --> 47:05.140]  And then they say, would you like bacon bits on it?
[47:05.380 --> 47:06.160]  You say yes.
[47:06.280 --> 47:09.420]  And they pull out a gun and just start blasting your potato.
[47:10.100 --> 47:12.180]  Chunks of potato flying everywhere.
[47:13.480 --> 47:15.880]  Grabs a shotgun with one hand.
[47:16.820 --> 47:18.080]  Fucking cocked and locked.
[47:18.660 --> 47:20.700]  How many blasts would you like, madam?
[47:21.600 --> 47:22.840]  I'll take two blasts, please.
[47:23.040 --> 47:24.920]  Load me up, six-shooter. Let's go.
[47:26.280 --> 47:29.360]  Maybe? I think a potato is a great example of the bits.
[47:29.980 --> 47:31.840]  There's no way all of the bits are staying on the spud.
[47:32.340 --> 47:34.040]  Well, they go in, man. You open the...
[47:34.040 --> 47:34.720]  Yeah, you put...
[47:34.720 --> 47:37.200]  You create like a little bowl out of the bits.
[47:37.460 --> 47:38.960]  You've never had a baked potato before?
[47:39.500 --> 47:41.860]  Yeah, but there's no... Do you think...
[47:41.860 --> 47:46.780]  Okay, so if I gave you a baked potato, a jack of potato, and I said put 100 bits on that,
[47:47.140 --> 47:49.040]  you would get all of them just to stay on the potato?
[47:49.520 --> 47:50.700]  I don't know if I'd use 100 bits.
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.120]  I mean, I'd probably get like 90 of them in there.
[47:54.640 --> 47:56.580]  Yeah, you... For me...
[47:56.580 --> 47:59.340]  Cut open the baked potato, mush it around a little bit,
[47:59.420 --> 48:02.220]  throw some butter in there, sour cream if you're fucking weird.
[48:02.220 --> 48:05.800]  You know, throw some chives in and then dump in the bacon bits,
[48:05.880 --> 48:08.440]  and they're in the potato bowl that you've created.
[48:09.160 --> 48:11.900]  I would even sometimes mix with the bits already in.
[48:12.280 --> 48:15.700]  So you put the bits in and then you start mixing it all around because it's...
[48:15.700 --> 48:16.240]  There you go.
[48:16.460 --> 48:16.600]  Yeah.
[48:17.040 --> 48:17.600]  Massaging it.
[48:17.760 --> 48:22.540]  Is there a way we can change our Twitch bits icon to bacon?
[48:23.460 --> 48:23.860]  I don't know.
[48:24.060 --> 48:25.620]  Bits? I don't think we can.
[48:25.760 --> 48:29.120]  It would just have to be our currency, like our regulation points.
[48:29.360 --> 48:31.220]  I don't think we can do... We can call them bacon bits.
[48:31.220 --> 48:33.020]  Why don't we just call them bacon bits?
[48:33.400 --> 48:34.820]  Yeah, I mean, I got no problem with that.
[48:35.620 --> 48:40.640]  I really... This conversation has led to me thinking about a novelty restaurant
[48:40.640 --> 48:46.460]  that shoots everything with weapons at you, but doesn't advertise they do that at all.
[48:47.180 --> 48:49.560]  So like the premise of like bacon bits.
[48:49.740 --> 48:52.940]  That is the scariest restaurant. Oh my God.
[48:53.760 --> 48:56.820]  Do you want... Someone orders a salad. Do you want cracked pepper on this?
[48:56.900 --> 48:57.640]  And it's like, yeah, sure.
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.760]  They pull out like a chain gun to crack it and just unload on the salad.
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.520]  Just everything is shot at the food.
[49:05.360 --> 49:06.540]  Oh, that'd be great.
[49:07.280 --> 49:08.760]  What a terrible idea.
[49:08.880 --> 49:10.020]  Oh, food guns.
[49:12.300 --> 49:15.860]  Condiments just bouncing off your plate like a super soaker.
[49:16.400 --> 49:18.840]  It would be cool if there was a restaurant that had just like a constant...
[49:19.960 --> 49:22.780]  Like imagine a ketchup gun and it would just shoot ketchup
[49:22.780 --> 49:25.640]  across the restaurant into like a catchment bucket.
[49:25.640 --> 49:28.400]  And if you wanted ketchup, you just had to lift your food up
[49:28.940 --> 49:30.920]  and take one of the ketchup hits.
[49:33.120 --> 49:35.860]  Isn't that like when you put your hand...
[49:35.860 --> 49:37.520]  There's like some restaurant where you like put your hand up
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.260]  and like they throw rolls to you from like across the restaurant.
[49:40.560 --> 49:42.320]  So it's kind of like that. That's fun.
[49:43.320 --> 49:46.020]  I was more imagining with what Gavin is saying.
[49:46.540 --> 49:49.480]  You know how they're like Japanese restaurants with conveyor belts.
[49:49.900 --> 49:52.580]  It's like that. It's almost like a rainforest cafe.
[49:52.580 --> 49:56.040]  But there's a river that runs by every table
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.220]  and they just rotate out what condiment is going down the river.
[49:59.820 --> 50:02.660]  So it's like it's like a Wonka Factory style.
[50:02.920 --> 50:04.200]  Like it could just be like a ketchup river.
[50:04.660 --> 50:07.320]  Exactly. So like if it's ketchup, you want some ketchup.
[50:07.500 --> 50:09.760]  You just dip your fries in the river as it's going by.
[50:10.520 --> 50:12.480]  I just wouldn't want to be at the end of the river.
[50:13.060 --> 50:17.180]  What if what if it's a river of water that moves,
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.100]  but there's little boats on the river and there's different condiments in the boats
[50:21.100 --> 50:24.880]  that go by and you can like dip your nugget in the boat as it goes by.
[50:25.160 --> 50:27.600]  You gotta you gotta capsize the boat, though.
[50:27.640 --> 50:29.560]  That's going to be it's going to be watery condiments.
[50:30.200 --> 50:30.780]  Yeah, maybe.
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.180]  And I don't want to take a bread roll from a boat.
[50:35.700 --> 50:36.320]  Why not?
[50:36.480 --> 50:38.980]  You'd rather have somebody throw it to your hand from across the room.
[50:39.720 --> 50:41.840]  I mean, it's it's a revolving sushi concept, right?
[50:41.840 --> 50:42.540]  But it's little boats.
[50:42.840 --> 50:43.080]  Yeah.
[50:43.120 --> 50:43.780]  And it's ketchup.
[50:44.140 --> 50:46.280]  Oh, there you go. Of course it exists.
[50:46.700 --> 50:48.960]  Yeah. Yeah. It's just revolving sushi, but on a boat.
[50:48.960 --> 50:51.380]  And then, yeah, that but mustard.
[50:55.340 --> 50:58.780]  I think rolls are the most catchable food that you would have in a restaurant.
[50:59.040 --> 51:00.020]  Somebody threw it at you.
[51:00.640 --> 51:02.900]  Well, I think for the for the little tiny river,
[51:03.560 --> 51:06.740]  I think hot dogs would be the perfect food for that.
[51:07.200 --> 51:09.460]  Because it's quite skinny, it could be quite a thin river.
[51:10.800 --> 51:12.700]  Like they just float the hot dog on down to you?
[51:13.020 --> 51:14.500]  Yeah, like buns going by.
[51:15.080 --> 51:21.120]  So you'd be OK with a hot dog bun going down the river, but not a roll going down the river?
[51:21.240 --> 51:22.940]  I would like my bun to be wrapped in foil.
[51:23.520 --> 51:26.840]  OK. I assumed it was a wet bread issue.
[51:27.280 --> 51:27.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:28.140 --> 51:32.780]  Yeah. What would be the worst food to catch at a restaurant?
[51:33.940 --> 51:34.760]  Probably soup.
[51:35.420 --> 51:37.200]  I guess soup would be tough because you couldn't.
[51:37.380 --> 51:39.600]  Mashed potatoes would be tough because it would just go everywhere.
[51:39.700 --> 51:41.320]  Chili would be a motherfucker.
[51:41.620 --> 51:42.800]  Chili is a yeah, yeah.
[51:42.800 --> 51:44.280]  I don't think you can even do liquids.
[51:45.080 --> 51:48.000]  That's too crazy. It has to be solid in some form.
[51:49.260 --> 51:49.860]  Spaghetti.
[51:51.460 --> 51:52.860]  Spaghetti would be tough.
[51:53.720 --> 51:59.560]  But maybe you could wrap the spaghetti around a meatball to kind of contain it.
[51:59.740 --> 52:01.000]  Spaghetti ball kind of situation.
[52:01.820 --> 52:06.780]  Has anyone ever had meatballs completely yarn balled by spaghetti?
[52:07.920 --> 52:08.900]  I don't know.
[52:09.020 --> 52:10.320]  I don't think so.
[52:10.820 --> 52:13.320]  Like a reverse spaghetti and meatballs?
[52:13.320 --> 52:16.700]  Yeah, but it's just like each one is a complete bite of spaghetti.
[52:17.200 --> 52:17.580]  Yeah.
[52:17.740 --> 52:19.000]  Completely encasing a meatball.
[52:19.280 --> 52:21.800]  I think it's probably really tough to do it.
[52:21.860 --> 52:26.740]  Has anybody ever done the opposite and hollowed out a meatball and filled it with spaghetti
[52:26.740 --> 52:28.320]  and then closed it back up?
[52:28.480 --> 52:29.600]  I feel like that'd be easier.
[52:30.300 --> 52:31.420]  That would definitely be easier.
[52:32.560 --> 52:37.220]  Because I don't know how you should make it stick with the roll of the spaghetti.
[52:37.600 --> 52:38.680]  I feel like it would just untangle.
[52:39.960 --> 52:41.260]  Meatball with spaghetti.
[52:41.620 --> 52:42.940]  Dude, no way.
[52:43.860 --> 52:44.800]  Oh my god!
[52:45.440 --> 52:46.100]  It exists as well!
[52:46.360 --> 52:47.240]  Everything's real!
[52:48.860 --> 52:52.100]  I feel like that's a lazy ball of yarn though.
[52:52.100 --> 52:52.880]  I can see the meatball.
[52:53.200 --> 52:53.680]  Yeah, I agree.
[52:53.800 --> 52:55.880]  There's also kind of the other way, I think.
[52:57.460 --> 53:00.280]  That's similar, but not as good as what I was thinking.
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:01.400 --> 53:04.200]  I think what you're thinking, Jeff, right around here.
[53:04.640 --> 53:05.880]  Ah, damn it!
[53:07.500 --> 53:12.940]  It's a giant meatball cake with an innard of spaghetti.
[53:12.940 --> 53:16.060]  It's called Inside Out Spaghetti.
[53:16.380 --> 53:20.040]  These are all interesting looking gimmicks that I assume are going to be not as good
[53:20.040 --> 53:21.040]  as just a bowl of spaghetti.
[53:21.140 --> 53:22.540]  No, definitely not.
[53:24.060 --> 53:26.740]  But I do like the idea of a restaurant where when you go in,
[53:26.800 --> 53:28.800]  they give you a baseball glove to catch your food.
[53:29.360 --> 53:30.420]  Everyone's got gloves on.
[53:30.920 --> 53:31.400]  Food glove.
[53:31.520 --> 53:33.300]  Could the glove be bread so you can eat it after?
[53:34.020 --> 53:34.180]  Yeah.
[53:34.860 --> 53:36.900]  Imagine a baseball mitt of bread.
[53:37.640 --> 53:41.600]  You imagine how gross that would be though, to eat that bread after you put your hand in it
[53:41.600 --> 53:42.780]  and caught things.
[53:43.240 --> 53:45.120]  No, it's going to have all the flavor of all the food.
[53:46.540 --> 53:47.360]  Yeah, your hand.
[53:47.540 --> 53:48.640]  Oh, God, it's gross.
[53:49.220 --> 53:51.820]  It'd be perfect if you still had taste buds on your fingers though.
[53:52.500 --> 53:56.000]  There's a bad throw and you catch somebody else's meal that's just free for you.
[53:56.260 --> 53:58.320]  And they still got to make the meal for the other person.
[53:58.420 --> 54:01.360]  But any food you catch that isn't yours, it's fair game.
[54:01.820 --> 54:03.040]  You just get an additional dish.
[54:03.480 --> 54:05.560]  I bet a beef wellington would be good to catch.
[54:06.180 --> 54:06.580]  Oh, yes.
[54:07.020 --> 54:09.740]  Anything that's like really nicely contained with all the ingredients.
[54:10.300 --> 54:10.460]  Yeah.
[54:10.460 --> 54:12.980]  Do you think you could eat your way out of a bread helmet?
[54:14.840 --> 54:16.040]  Not for me, no.
[54:21.160 --> 54:22.520]  How thick is the helmet?
[54:22.720 --> 54:24.980]  And are we talking like a Spartan helmet?
[54:25.740 --> 54:29.140]  Are we talking like a fully encased head helmet?
[54:29.520 --> 54:31.900]  I like that I say helmet and you immediately go to Spartan.
[54:32.220 --> 54:35.220]  Well, I'm thinking that's to me the first helmet I think of.
[54:35.520 --> 54:37.900]  Are we talking like an astronaut type?
[54:38.720 --> 54:39.340]  What do you mean?
[54:39.440 --> 54:39.920]  What do you mean?
[54:39.920 --> 54:40.480]  What do you mean?
[54:41.380 --> 54:42.260]  What do you mean?
[54:43.880 --> 54:45.040]  Somebody says helmet.
[54:45.160 --> 54:47.700]  That's the first helmet I think of is the Spartan helmet.
[54:48.560 --> 54:49.280]  God damn it.
[54:49.440 --> 54:50.560]  Someone says a bread helmet?
[54:51.080 --> 54:51.920]  God damn.
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.700]  Check the YouTube or video version on Patreon for this.
[55:01.600 --> 55:02.160]  Oh, my God.
[55:02.320 --> 55:05.300]  I would argue that what that person is wearing is not a bread helmet,
[55:05.300 --> 55:09.360]  but is actually the start of a Katamari ball that they are just part of.
[55:10.340 --> 55:11.640]  That's like a bread roof.
[55:11.740 --> 55:13.280]  That's more like bread shingles.
[55:15.880 --> 55:17.100]  That's sort of a bread helmet.
[55:18.160 --> 55:19.480]  That's definitely a bread helmet.
[55:21.520 --> 55:22.860]  You don't think...
[55:22.860 --> 55:26.060]  What's the helmet you think of immediately when somebody says helmet?
[55:26.960 --> 55:28.740]  Oh, interesting.
[55:29.040 --> 55:29.560]  There you go, football.
[55:30.460 --> 55:32.160]  I think of an army Kevlar helmet.
[55:32.840 --> 55:36.020]  Yeah, I was thinking more of like a sports helmet.
[55:36.620 --> 55:37.960]  So you don't even have a helmet in mind.
[55:37.960 --> 55:39.460]  You're coming at me for my Spartan helmet.
[55:41.340 --> 55:42.100]  But I just...
[55:42.940 --> 55:46.700]  If someone said, quick, put on a helmet, I wouldn't try looking for a Spartan one.
[55:47.080 --> 55:48.880]  I wouldn't look for one because I don't have one.
[55:48.940 --> 55:50.920]  But that's the first imagery that I think of.
[55:51.500 --> 55:55.580]  All those fancy Zack Snyder shots of people in Spartan helmets.
[55:55.880 --> 55:55.920]  Yeah.
[55:56.900 --> 55:58.280]  Imagine that, but a loaf.
[56:01.200 --> 56:02.980]  Speaking of helmets.
[56:04.220 --> 56:04.940]  Nick's wearing the mask.
[56:05.480 --> 56:07.120]  Yeah, Nick's definitely wearing the mask.
[56:07.120 --> 56:08.560]  Yeah, it's pretty fucking clear.
[56:12.660 --> 56:13.960]  We got him!
[56:14.680 --> 56:16.620]  I knew we'd ever win this game!
[56:16.860 --> 56:17.360]  We got you!
[56:17.440 --> 56:18.320]  Yep, yep.
[56:18.540 --> 56:19.440]  We got you.
[56:19.500 --> 56:20.240]  We got the monkey.
[56:20.500 --> 56:21.080]  We got the monkey.
[56:21.280 --> 56:22.640]  We got him.
[56:23.960 --> 56:24.640]  I can't believe it.
[56:24.640 --> 56:25.260]  We did it!
[56:26.420 --> 56:27.820]  I'm so mad right now.
[56:28.160 --> 56:29.520]  I was like, 10 minutes, 10 minutes.
[56:29.760 --> 56:32.460]  I texted the group.
[56:32.920 --> 56:36.100]  So 10 minutes into the episode, I think Nick is wearing the mask.
[56:36.860 --> 56:40.720]  And Nick, you become a different person with the mask on.
[56:40.960 --> 56:44.380]  You were in monkey mode the whole time.
[56:45.180 --> 56:48.600]  And I just kept having to ask you to repeat yourself because you were so far away.
[56:48.640 --> 56:50.080]  And I thought, I never have to do that with Nick.
[56:50.180 --> 56:50.620]  This is weird.
[56:51.560 --> 56:56.680]  I feel like when I was asking him about the audio things, I originally was on your side,
[56:56.760 --> 56:58.680]  Eric, and then I thought he answered that pretty clearly.
[56:58.780 --> 57:02.460]  But I thought maybe he's like pushing his mouth to the front of the mask to try and
[57:02.460 --> 57:07.480]  and then I figured towards the end, no one would know better than Eric.
[57:07.860 --> 57:10.580]  Why didn't you just open the mouth and talk normal?
[57:11.520 --> 57:13.020]  I've been told that that's cheating.
[57:13.160 --> 57:13.620]  That is cheating.
[57:13.980 --> 57:16.460]  That's great that you didn't do that.
[57:19.020 --> 57:24.500]  For me, it was the quiet answering sort of like the way that you were,
[57:24.600 --> 57:29.880]  you sounded far from like the microphone, but way more oohs and yeahs.
[57:29.880 --> 57:32.680]  Like you were in 100% eat mode.
[57:33.200 --> 57:33.400]  Yeah.
[57:33.900 --> 57:34.980]  Voicing by my own petard.
[57:35.100 --> 57:36.740]  It's 100% caught.
[57:38.500 --> 57:44.100]  Now, back when I made my great mistake, I am locked in now when we do this podcast.
[57:44.420 --> 57:48.680]  So I didn't immediately notice the Eric text until quite a bit later
[57:48.680 --> 57:51.080]  and me trying to catch up on what happened.
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.880]  And I felt like such a fucking idiot after doing that because there's a point I felt like.
[57:56.960 --> 57:58.400]  And this is a very specific reference.
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.300]  Tom Sandoval in The Traitors, where they set up a way to like catch a trader
[58:03.300 --> 58:07.140]  and then he just fucks it up by like explaining for them out of it,
[58:07.420 --> 58:09.500]  where Jeff was like, Nick, could you repeat that?
[58:09.560 --> 58:14.540]  And I answered for Nick and understanding the context of what Jeff was doing at that point.
[58:14.660 --> 58:15.980]  I was like, I'm a fucking idiot.
[58:16.240 --> 58:18.920]  We're trying to get more TikTok in a subtle way.
[58:18.980 --> 58:20.300]  I hear the Tom Sandoval of this podcast.
[58:20.680 --> 58:21.820]  No, I don't.
[58:21.920 --> 58:23.000]  Don't put that on me.
[58:23.320 --> 58:24.840]  But it was a Tom Sandoval.
[58:24.840 --> 58:30.240]  I've thought of that in The Traitors where I just, through not being part of the loop.
[58:30.660 --> 58:32.400]  In his case, he's just a fucking idiot.
[58:32.740 --> 58:35.200]  But I didn't know what we were doing.
[58:36.400 --> 58:40.740]  Yeah, there was a lot of extra like, what if I swapped asses with Nick?
[58:40.900 --> 58:42.800]  Hey, Nick, what was wrong with all that audio?
[58:44.020 --> 58:49.000]  I do love that there's a whole conversation going on throughout the entire podcast of us
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.700]  texting that Andrew finally got onto.
[58:52.260 --> 58:54.760]  Halfway through, though, Gavin's like, I'm not convinced.
[58:54.760 --> 58:56.600]  And it's like, what would convince you, though?
[58:57.420 --> 58:59.300]  I felt like it was very obvious.
[58:59.540 --> 59:02.340]  I got de-convinced after he was talking about the audio because I thought,
[59:02.400 --> 59:03.720]  oh, we can hear this pretty well.
[59:06.140 --> 59:07.480]  Well, Nick, we got you.
[59:09.220 --> 59:10.280]  I got got.
[59:10.580 --> 59:11.680]  I can't believe it.
[59:11.820 --> 59:12.840]  What does this mean now?
[59:13.240 --> 59:13.860]  I don't know.
[59:13.960 --> 59:15.820]  Oh, I have no idea.
[59:16.000 --> 59:16.420]  Oh, I don't know.
[59:16.540 --> 59:17.460]  We win 2025.
[59:18.320 --> 59:19.040]  Yes, yeah.
[59:19.500 --> 59:21.220]  There was a prize for it, I think.
[59:21.860 --> 59:22.760]  I didn't get a prize ever.
[59:22.760 --> 59:23.640]  I think the audience...
[59:26.380 --> 59:28.020]  The audience will let us know if there's a prize.
[59:28.060 --> 59:28.700]  Yeah, if they're...
[59:28.700 --> 59:29.140]  They remember.
[59:29.500 --> 59:30.200]  They will know.
[59:31.100 --> 59:32.180]  I just can't believe...
[59:32.180 --> 59:33.680]  I didn't think we'd ever win this game.
[59:34.260 --> 59:36.340]  So we're good till 2026.
[59:36.520 --> 59:37.260]  Yeah, we don't have to worry.
[59:37.980 --> 59:39.020]  The watch has ended.
[59:39.600 --> 59:40.580]  We can all stand down.
[59:41.060 --> 59:42.660]  Yeah, yeah, we can all stand down.
[59:42.740 --> 59:43.120]  Thank God.
[59:43.220 --> 59:44.560]  Damn, Eric, that was phenomenal work.
[59:44.900 --> 59:45.320]  Thank you.
[59:45.380 --> 59:45.960]  It was just...
[59:45.960 --> 59:47.300]  I run two companies with this guy.
[59:47.380 --> 59:48.660]  I know when he's in monkey mode, baby.
[59:49.000 --> 59:50.680]  Also, hell of a hell of a try, Nick.
[59:51.020 --> 59:52.220]  Really appreciate how bold you are.
[59:52.220 --> 59:52.780]  Yeah.
[59:52.880 --> 59:54.940]  Well, I thought you hadn't heard me in it yet.
[59:55.120 --> 59:55.920]  No, I thought you did great.
[59:56.040 --> 59:56.300]  So maybe I can sneak it by.
[59:56.800 --> 59:56.980]  Yeah.
[59:57.520 --> 59:57.840]  Fuck.
[59:58.040 --> 59:58.720]  Tough stuff, dude.
[59:58.920 --> 59:59.300]  Tough stuff.
[59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.300]  Oh, I'm so disappointed.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.820]  Also, way to play it off.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.940]  Had no idea you were onto me.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.240]  Yeah, just getting that text going.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.320]  I'm like, oh, should we slack?
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.820]  I'm like, they're not going to see it if we're slacking.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:08.900]  There had to be a text.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.800]  And then, man, I just felt like, oh my God, we're on top of this.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.580]  We got this guy.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.940]  We got this fucking monkey right here.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.500]  We're like Lorenz and Lorenz's local lawyers.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.000]  We're on top of it.
[01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:23.500]  I was so sure that I had you that I was rolling on me the whole time.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.200]  Awesome!
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.720]  I knew within 10 minutes.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.120]  That's just a lot of footage.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.800]  We decided to wait until the end of the episode.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.060]  God, you really got my hopes up.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.040]  The thing that surprised me most is that this is the beginning
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.020]  of a text conversation with everyone except Nick.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.300]  And I thought that would have existed already, but it didn't.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.160]  It does?
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.760]  It doesn't for me.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.040]  So maybe it's a text conversation without Jeff and Nick.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.960]  Nope, it's the four of us.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.080]  And I have a bunch of texts from...
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.800]  Well, now Nick's going to feel left out.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.720]  For me, it starts with, I think Nick is wearing the mask.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.360]  These are all from like 2024.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.040]  When we were working with Nick?
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.200]  2024, 2023.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.660]  Yeah, I have like a lot of stuff.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:08.760]  What?
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.700]  It's not a lot.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.100]  Whatever he's saying, it's not a lot, Nick.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.600]  I don't, listen, I don't, trying to not make feel Nick feel bad.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.560]  It's not one way or the other.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.660]  I'm telling you that there's a bunch of texts from this group.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.880]  Why can't I see them?
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.800]  I don't know.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.040]  I'm just telling you what I have.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.380]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.240]  Sounds fake.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.580]  Oh, it might be because of Jeff's broken ass RCS.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.480]  It might have been a different thread for me.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.400]  Might be.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.780]  There's pictures of, there's like an iguana jumping and eating a french fry.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:46.720]  There's a video from like people, like I guess me dancing at Jeff's wedding.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.520]  And yeah, there's like a bunch of stuff.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.900]  You just didn't want Nick to know?
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:51.860]  Huh?
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.120]  Who's, are you talking about me?
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:54.840]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.820]  The guy who didn't text those things?
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:57.860]  Sure.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.680]  Yeah, I didn't want Nick to know about the stuff you guys texted to me.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.300]  Absolutely.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:08.780]  It was great when Jeff's phone was fucked up because I would text something in one group text
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:12.120]  and then it would reply in a completely different text.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.940]  It would be a completely different conversation.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.820]  It was crazy.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.340]  And I wouldn't get any of it.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.600]  And we would be making decisions about the company that I didn't know anything about.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.040]  And then I'd have to figure it out from context clues later when I'm like, did we decide to do that?
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.500]  We just shouldn't talk about work outside of Slack.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.400]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.340]  It is the word platform.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.360]  Is that the slogan?
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.780]  Yeah, it is.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.120]  They got dicks in every direction and it's your work platform.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.760]  I know why we sometimes talk on a text chain without Nick.
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.120]  It's because we're planning a thing.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.520]  There you go.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:47.980]  Yeah.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.000]  What the fuck does that mean?
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.920]  Well, it's clearly about you.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.280]  That's all you can't know.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.520]  Not the prank that you were talking about.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:01.620]  Well, we should probably wrap this one up so that way we can do another.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.980]  We're doing two this week again.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:03.520]  I'm excited.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.020]  Just FYI for everyone.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.560]  So we should probably wrap this one up so we can get into the next one.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.460]  How do you guys feel about that?
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.860]  I feel great about it.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:11.840]  Let's do it.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.820]  I just feel great that we can relax now for the rest of the year.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:15.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.240]  Put our feet up and just pure joy.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.240]  Easy peasy podcasting now.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.960]  I feel like shit.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.760]  What I love about this game.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.840]  Being the last man in the rotation is I'm never really playing.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.540]  It's a game that we either win or lose without me having any impact at all.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:33.980]  It's great.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.060]  I just get to observe even though I'm on the team.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:36.320]  All right.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.520]  It looks like 2026.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.700]  We're waiting for Andrew's sort of go and we'll see if he's on the watch.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.460]  We'll see how it goes.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.340]  Very interesting.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.540]  Very, very interesting.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:50.680]  But you don't have to wait till 2026 to hear us be idiots again because we'll be doing it
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.860]  next week right here on Regulation Podcast episode 58.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.600]  Hope to see or hear you there.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.360]  Bye bye.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:03:59.260]  Bye.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.360]  Man.
