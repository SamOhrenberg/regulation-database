[00:00.560 --> 00:07.640]  Hey, it's Paris. You know I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and
[00:07.640 --> 00:14.300]  AutoCamp, I just slept under them. Picture me, serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious
[00:14.300 --> 00:21.440]  Airstream, making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors
[00:21.440 --> 00:28.980]  meets Hilton hospitality. That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for
[00:28.980 --> 00:47.320]  the stay. Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:47.400 --> 00:55.220]  With me as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Free. Episode 205. Don't quote me on this, but I
[00:55.220 --> 01:00.400]  believe this is our 204th episode. The first permanent potato patches on U.S. soil were
[01:00.400 --> 01:06.820]  established in 1719 near Londonderry, New Hampshire. Sorry, go ahead. Continue. I just
[01:06.820 --> 01:13.640]  wanted to get that out of the way. Oh, what was the potato facts bit? I can't remember. I can't either.
[01:15.620 --> 01:22.280]  Uh, you had one. I just, uh, we'll talk about between episodes. That was the whole thing.
[01:22.560 --> 01:26.880]  Was it? Oh, you've, this is your Easter egg. You've buried potatoes somewhere. This is the
[01:26.880 --> 01:33.160]  second to last episode of F*** Face under that name. Uh, so I need to, I need to empty out my
[01:33.160 --> 02:00.500]  drawers a little bit. Easter eggs got found. Pantry. You might have some. Gavin, I was tracking you via Slack. People have speculated on that for a long time. Slack, it automatically updates what time zone you're in whenever you sign on. So that is when we're doing the money thing. That was my system of checking to see. But did it ever change? It automatically changes whenever. But did you ever see it somewhere else? No, because I eventually just came to terms with the idea you were not coming.
[02:00.500 --> 02:09.680]  So. Whilst, you know, VPN would keep it in central time, wouldn't it? You. You're not VPNing on Slack. Calm down.
[02:11.880 --> 02:17.900]  Relax. I gotta agree with Andrew on that. You're not the international man of mystery. I mean, VPN is just the whole device.
[02:19.580 --> 02:23.800]  We're going to throw around fancy letters like that. I don't know. This is a guy over here. I don't know.
[02:23.900 --> 02:28.760]  I don't think your system works, son. I think it works great because I know whenever you're in London,
[02:28.760 --> 02:36.040]  son, I know whenever you're overseas, son. Maybe because I tell you. He's got you there, son.
[02:36.560 --> 02:41.320]  I'd check it. That's how I knew it. Because I, I don't, you know, time is complicated. And if you
[02:41.320 --> 02:47.520]  were back home, I didn't want to message you at 2 a.m. So I'd check Slack to see what time you were
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.600]  in. I mean, I don't get alerts in the night, wherever I am. Yeah, we clarified that later.
[02:51.940 --> 02:58.200]  That's why I started texting you at 2 a.m. I think I think my last 2 a.m. text to you
[02:58.760 --> 03:06.080]  was what? Was it about thumbs? Was it appendages? Or maybe I didn't text. I was thinking about what
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.180]  animal I would most like to fist bump, which then turned into which animals have hands.
[03:12.440 --> 03:17.760]  Oh, what would be a good fist bump? A sloth. Sloth would be an awesome fist bump. Does a
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.560]  sloth have hands? Yeah. Sloth has hands with those crazy claws and they're always curled up. It makes
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.520]  a perfect fist, man. A sloth would be a perfect fist bump animal. It would take a really long
[03:27.520 --> 03:32.080]  time. I don't think you need hands. See, that's potentially a date. That looks like a wolverine.
[03:32.380 --> 03:38.260]  I think you don't need hands or fists for a fist bump. I think fist bumping an octopus
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.340]  would feel so good. I hate it. No. I don't trust octopuses. It would roll a tentacle
[03:44.340 --> 03:50.540]  into a fist shape and it would just go boink. Oh, I don't like it. I don't trust it. It's gonna
[03:50.540 --> 03:56.340]  it's gonna fist bump me and then wrap around my wrist. It would take me out like Jack Nicholson
[03:56.340 --> 04:00.280]  in Mars attacks. Like I'd think everything was all good and then it would just immediately on
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.680]  the attack. And then you'd have a flag sticking out of your heart. Yeah. The octopus flag. The
[04:05.680 --> 04:14.100]  octopus flag. Everyone's favorite nation. Octopus. It turned into a larger debate of do raccoons
[04:14.100 --> 04:18.660]  have hands and what constitutes a hand. I was talking with someone who felt that raccoons
[04:18.660 --> 04:24.360]  didn't have hands because they didn't have thumbs. And is the thumb a requirement to have a hand?
[04:24.360 --> 04:30.180]  I think a thumb is the only requirement to having a thumb. You don't think it eliminates? That's a
[04:30.180 --> 04:37.280]  hand. That's a fucking hand. If you had a thumb instead of a big toe, it wouldn't be a hand.
[04:41.180 --> 04:46.800]  I just think if we're not like the placement, that's like total thumb placement, right? Yeah.
[04:48.040 --> 04:51.720]  Spot. So why isn't it a thumb? Like it doesn't have enough bend? Doesn't have enough joints?
[04:51.720 --> 04:55.240]  I guess it's just not considered a thumb. I don't think a thumb to me.
[04:56.700 --> 05:02.860]  Look up. Do raccoons have thumbs? Maybe maybe you shouldn't do anything on your computer, man.
[05:03.460 --> 05:07.660]  No, I'm not. I'm like, I'm using my phone. OK, I'm so I'm so worried about anything on this
[05:07.660 --> 05:12.760]  computer. We just had we just had a slow start to the let's play today. Raccoons do not have
[05:12.760 --> 05:17.220]  opposable thumbs. They do have five dexterous toes. They just don't have opposable thumbs.
[05:17.220 --> 05:24.180]  What makes this thumb opposable? Yeah, I don't know. Why is my thumb opposable,
[05:24.300 --> 05:29.900]  but my finger isn't opposable? Is it because it's opposite? Is that what opposable means?
[05:30.580 --> 05:36.600]  The ability is facilitated by a cellar saddle shaped joint between the trip trapezium,
[05:36.780 --> 05:41.560]  the wrist bone that supports the thumb and the first metacarpal, which allows an approximate
[05:41.560 --> 05:48.440]  45 degree range of rotation of the thumb about its own long axis. I think it's I think it's
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.480]  because you can like move it left and right and up and down like further than you could your
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.860]  fingers. I think that's what it's saying. My my argument for raccoons having hands, despite a
[05:57.860 --> 06:05.360]  lack of thumbs, is if a person got into a very specific, let's say, like construction accident
[06:05.920 --> 06:12.560]  that resulted in them losing only both of their thumbs, nobody would say they lost their hands.
[06:12.800 --> 06:19.620]  What if they kept the thumbs but lost all opposability? Oh, man. I don't want to live
[06:19.620 --> 06:24.380]  in a world with not. Here's why a raccoon has hands, because it can count to 10 on them.
[06:24.960 --> 06:30.420]  Okay, so Jeff, if you lost if you lost your thumbs in a construction accident and the only
[06:30.420 --> 06:35.180]  thumbs they could replace it with are raccoon fingers, would you take that? Yes. Okay.
[06:35.860 --> 06:41.480]  Yes. I feel like I'd be just like the girl in Fallout. I just take the new finger. I don't care.
[06:42.640 --> 06:47.700]  I feel like you might have a huge advantage in thumb wars. I bet you a raccoon toe as your
[06:47.700 --> 06:53.580]  thumb is a I mean, that's a sneaky thumb. I mean, yeah. I bet you could pierce stuff with that nail,
[06:53.700 --> 06:59.700]  too. Oh, I could do my own. I could put new holes in belts. What would be I want?
[07:01.220 --> 07:06.560]  That's so specific. I was just trying to think of what I've ever punctured in my life.
[07:07.960 --> 07:11.040]  What would be the best animal to hug? Not a sloth.
[07:14.760 --> 07:19.400]  My brain immediately went bear, but I don't want to deal with the claws. The claws make that a
[07:19.400 --> 07:24.860]  problem. And I feel like every other part of a bear hug. It's a term. A bear hand has like
[07:24.860 --> 07:28.820]  seven fingers, doesn't it? Gracie wants to hug a polar bear. Yeah, bear hug.
[07:28.820 --> 07:34.140]  Why a polar bear specifically? A polar bear? I've just always really liked them.
[07:35.100 --> 07:41.440]  I mean, I mean, it's it's friendly in this scenario, right? Yeah. Coke has done wonders
[07:41.440 --> 07:47.680]  for the image of the polar bear. Like it's not like what what would be the best animal to hug
[07:47.680 --> 07:50.740]  that is also not going to rip your throat out while you're hugging it. It's just like what
[07:50.740 --> 07:54.060]  would be the best animal to hug? I don't know if a polar bear would often be good to hug. It's
[07:54.060 --> 07:58.520]  probably going to be really cold and wet and damp. I think best animal to share a coke with,
[07:58.520 --> 08:03.460]  for sure. I like the idea if it's not wet, if it's just chilly, a nice little chilly hug
[08:03.460 --> 08:09.940]  that feels comfy. That feels relaxing. Like that does look cute, but there's no way they smell good.
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.280]  There has to be like a minimum size requirement for the hug, right? Like it would you can't be
[08:18.280 --> 08:23.480]  like, oh, like raccoon isn't a good answer because it's not getting its arms around you. It's just
[08:23.480 --> 08:29.580]  sort of being like, that's cute. Like he's trying to hug you, but you know, like can't. So like
[08:29.580 --> 08:34.060]  there's that kind of thing. You know what I like? What's the minimum? Can I ask a question that I
[08:34.060 --> 08:40.400]  hope doesn't make me sound dumb? Yeah, of course. Well, Gavin, you were saying that they probably
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.680]  smell bad. Yeah. Does it smell when it's too cold outside? Like can it get so cold you don't smell
[08:46.680 --> 08:53.420]  stuff? I don't know if this is a real thing or not, but I feel like there is a scent to very cold.
[08:54.060 --> 08:58.480]  I feel like you could smell the chill. I don't know that I've ever smelled anything when I've
[08:58.480 --> 09:07.880]  been cold other than the smell of cold. Have now I've been to like a penguin encounter thing where
[09:07.880 --> 09:11.440]  like they let you into like the penguin place and like you feed the penguins and stuff.
[09:12.920 --> 09:22.440]  It was so fucking cold in there and it stunk so bad. It was awful. So it must like it must be so,
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.640]  so, so much colder to not have any smell at all, because I'll never forget the smell of
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.740]  the penguin enclosure. Do you think maybe in that instance, maybe it's the opposite and maybe
[09:31.740 --> 09:37.220]  cold makes stuff smell more like there's not heat in the way? Like all the heat waves are gone.
[09:37.220 --> 09:47.320]  There's a bell curve. Yeah. Like normal smells. It's called the smell curve. 15 degrees is no
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.040]  smell. But then you go below 15, you're like, oh, no, it's minus six. This smells like shit.
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.860]  Like, yeah, that's a good idea. Nick wrote warm air is not as dense as cold as the molecules have
[09:56.860 --> 10:02.520]  more room to move around and they move faster. Making them more available for us to smell so
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.920]  that the more room for the molecule, the stink. So that means right before a vacuum is the stinkiest
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.860]  possible time. Like if I farted right before a vacuum. That's why farts smell worse under
[10:15.860 --> 10:19.500]  the covers. It's not just that they're trapped. It's that it's hotter under there.
[10:19.500 --> 10:30.400]  Oh, yeah. Andrew going, hmm. Well, I'm thinking I am. I always I wish that what's the science?
[10:30.560 --> 10:33.800]  I don't know about the science that you know how there's hot sauce. I always wish there was
[10:33.800 --> 10:41.320]  cold sauce. That's that might in the history of this show. That might be the most Gavin sentence
[10:41.320 --> 10:48.760]  you've ever fucking said, man. Well, I can't handle super spicy things, but I feel like my
[10:48.760 --> 10:54.220]  tolerance for cold would be very high. But there's not like a sauce that makes things colder in the
[10:54.220 --> 11:00.160]  same way that gives a hot sensation. What is cold? What is a cold flavor to you? Like what's what
[11:00.160 --> 11:06.560]  tastes cold? I want my mouth to burr in the same way my mouth would go. Oh, that's hot when I'm
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.920]  biting into some hot sauce. Yeah, no, I get it. But I'm like the only flavor that I can think
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.420]  of because spicy is just spicy. It just it tastes like spice or heat. Right. But the only thing I can
[11:15.420 --> 11:21.660]  think of that's like the flavor of cold would be like that pale blue Gatorade. Oh yeah. What about
[11:21.660 --> 11:26.240]  oatmeal? I'm okay with that. No. Oatmeal. Do you have cold oatmeal?
[11:28.600 --> 11:34.360]  Well, yeah. Why oatmeal? It's just really not spicy.
[11:38.540 --> 11:41.830]  Gavin, oatmeal's kind of not anything. I don't really...
[11:44.750 --> 11:47.390]  Get your piping hot greens here.
[11:53.290 --> 11:58.370]  I just feel like if you want cold sauce, stuff is hot because they made it hot. They put spice
[11:58.370 --> 12:05.430]  in it or they put stuff in it. You just go, you're just undoing. But I'm saying I wish
[12:06.040 --> 12:11.150]  in the same way I wish there was a capsaicin equivalent to cold. Mint.
[12:11.830 --> 12:17.570]  Oh yeah. But mint is like a different flavor. I don't know. Yeah. And too much mint can have a spicy
[12:17.570 --> 12:23.830]  effect. It can, but when I think of it as like a sauce or like some kind of other piece to something,
[12:23.990 --> 12:28.910]  it's cooling. It has a cooling effect more than any other food that I can really like think of.
[12:29.270 --> 12:33.430]  Gracie is saying lettuce, ice, and water, which is not helping this conversation at all.
[12:34.770 --> 12:39.830]  That all tastes like the opposite of spice to me though, for sure. What about like an iced lettuce sauce?
[12:41.790 --> 12:47.630]  Uh, blend salad dressing, blend lettuce and ice and put that on a hot curry and see what happens.
[12:47.850 --> 12:55.070]  Oh, you could call it lead ice. Is that a lettuce? The look of disappointment of the restaurant
[12:55.070 --> 13:01.450]  seeing you pour your lead ice over the dinner that you just made. I would want to see if I
[13:01.450 --> 13:08.410]  could get a very spicy vindaloo, put some lettuce sauce on it, and then put a bunch of hot sauce on
[13:08.410 --> 13:16.950]  top. I'd really trick everything about my mouth. I just wish there was a negate. I just wish it
[13:16.950 --> 13:21.970]  went the other way. I wish there was a cold ones. That wasn't beer related because I know that's a
[13:21.970 --> 13:28.450]  beer thing. A genuine just cold sauce. I'd be a fan of. But the temperature wouldn't be cold.
[13:28.710 --> 13:36.890]  It would just be non-spicy. Well, no. I mean, no. It needs to be cold. Hot sauce isn't hot.
[13:36.890 --> 13:43.830]  What do you mean? It's not spicy. It's not like it's 125 degrees when you put it in.
[13:43.830 --> 13:50.230]  No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Room temp. Cool. Cool. Thanks, man. All right. So why is what I said
[13:50.230 --> 13:54.610]  didn't make any sense? Well, what did you say? Can you repeat what you said and I'll re-evaluate?
[13:56.490 --> 14:02.210]  Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. State what you were going to say. I don't really remember what I
[14:02.210 --> 14:05.990]  said. The sentence of me bitching about it grammatically collapsed from under me.
[14:06.950 --> 14:10.690]  I feel like I feel like you're not even sure where you stand.
[14:12.890 --> 14:19.110]  I mean, I'll be on your side in the sense that it feels like every single product is becoming spicy.
[14:19.390 --> 14:26.010]  Like even the Starbucks summer drinks, we've put spicy shit in them. But I've never heard of a
[14:26.010 --> 14:31.670]  spiced oatmeal. That does seem like an unclaimed, untouched, maybe just cold spice it up a little.
[14:32.270 --> 14:38.310]  Oh, yeah, some cinnamon. But like, that's not I can. I feel like cinnamon is its own thing as well.
[14:39.050 --> 14:43.250]  It's not it's not cool or spicy. I don't know where cinnamon comes from.
[14:43.390 --> 14:50.250]  Isn't it spice? It's no, but like spice. Do I dig it out of the ground? Is it in a tree?
[14:50.990 --> 14:55.310]  Where would I find cinnamon? Now I want to I'm asking because you're you're you're kind of like
[14:55.310 --> 14:59.150]  positing this like, do I do this? Do I do that? Where do you where do you think it comes from?
[14:59.150 --> 15:05.870]  It strikes me as something I'd need a shovel for. It feels earthy, feels like it's in the ground.
[15:06.070 --> 15:12.110]  Only raccoon thumbs can dig them out. Yeah, only non opposable thumbs. That is.
[15:12.970 --> 15:18.490]  So you guys aren't familiar with the great raccoon scandal of 2016. Cinnabon almost went down.
[15:19.410 --> 15:25.750]  Raccoon labor. Is it a plant? No, it's a tree bark, actually.
[15:26.330 --> 15:31.110]  It's true. That makes sense because I've seen it all rolled up when you buy the stick of it.
[15:31.150 --> 15:34.950]  Like a similar to vanilla. Yeah. Vanilla comes from a tree.
[15:35.190 --> 15:40.010]  Well, it's barky, isn't it? Like bean bark. It is. I don't know.
[15:41.150 --> 15:46.990]  What is happening? What is going on? It seems where does vanilla come from?
[15:47.130 --> 15:53.110]  It's not like a it's like a fruit. Vanilla is just a bean. Cinnamon is bark from a tree.
[15:53.670 --> 16:01.570]  But isn't isn't vanilla beans like barkish? What does that what do you mean? What does that mean?
[16:02.410 --> 16:07.890]  I know cocoa beans are on trees because of Minecraft. Vanilla bean. Let me look at some
[16:07.890 --> 16:14.870]  pictures here. OK, here's a couple. Look at it. It looks I would never key. Right. Yeah.
[16:15.130 --> 16:20.870]  And you know why that is, Gavin? Why is that? Because it's a bean that they dry out.
[16:20.870 --> 16:26.530]  It's a looks like it's vanilla. It's like a string bean. It's it's less barky and more.
[16:26.870 --> 16:30.950]  It's more like a pod than a bark. So it just looks like a green bean at first.
[16:31.030 --> 16:36.870]  OK, right. Right. So it's not even close. They're like similar.
[16:37.990 --> 16:41.050]  I just thought they came like that. I didn't realize we did that.
[16:42.010 --> 16:47.190]  So what's this raw vanilla taste like? I don't know. Like like before they do
[16:47.190 --> 16:53.230]  like process it or whatever. Yeah, I don't know. Have you let's find out like cacao before?
[16:53.510 --> 16:58.890]  It's yes. Yeah, it looks like brain. Yeah, exactly. So like you wouldn't think that
[16:58.890 --> 17:03.870]  that's what chocolate comes from. But here we are. You know, it was like a thing. It's gross.
[17:04.370 --> 17:08.530]  If you gave me a machete and said, go get some vanilla from this jungle.
[17:08.710 --> 17:13.530]  I'm never identifying that as vanilla. Yeah. And even if I asked a local and he said,
[17:13.530 --> 17:18.490]  get that, I'd call him an idiot. Yeah, I'd be like, I don't trust this guy.
[17:19.090 --> 17:23.470]  That's how I'm sure I was. The vanilla didn't look like that. I'm going to chop this off the tree
[17:23.470 --> 17:29.290]  to be polite, but I ain't fooling for this. So is it only is it only brown if we bake it like
[17:29.290 --> 17:35.350]  it's coffee green? Yeah. No coffee. Yeah. Don't say. Why are you saying no? Well, the cherry,
[17:35.930 --> 17:42.190]  the cherry, the coffee cherry doesn't have to be the coffee bean like a raw coffee bean.
[17:42.190 --> 17:47.250]  Yeah. Coffee is cherry. A coffee bean is cherry. Coffee bean comes from a cherry.
[17:47.470 --> 17:52.890]  What? And it's a fruit. It's the inner part of a fruit. I've always wanted to try a coffee cherry.
[17:53.650 --> 17:59.130]  Why is it coffee cherry? Wow. That's a coffee bean. Yeah. Before they're roasted,
[17:59.310 --> 18:04.570]  they're this sort of like greenish, palish, yellow color. And then they're look up coffee bean
[18:05.130 --> 18:10.030]  before it's beaned. It's a fruit. It's a coffee bean before it's bean. Is that what you said?
[18:10.030 --> 18:16.990]  Yeah. He's totally right. You got it. Coffee bean before it's bean. First, first result. I'll send
[18:16.990 --> 18:24.890]  it here. Okay. Here you go. Yes. It's like a cherry. So it's a little fruit, like a little
[18:24.890 --> 18:32.890]  grape. So it goes through a cherry phase. Yeah. And then what? We cook it afterwards? Yes. Wow.
[18:33.130 --> 18:39.650]  What the damn? A coffee bean is like the cherry seed. The thing, the thing about coffee is that
[18:39.650 --> 18:44.950]  it should probably be way more expensive than it is because it doesn't grow everywhere and you
[18:44.950 --> 18:52.870]  have to do so much to it to make it be drinkable. When, when does the caffeine occur? Is it
[18:52.870 --> 18:58.030]  caffeinated cherry? I don't, you know, I'm not sure, but I bet it is. I bet there's some, I bet
[18:58.030 --> 19:04.490]  there's naturally occurring caffeine within it. Now I'm not a big coffee guy, but look at how
[19:04.490 --> 19:10.190]  fucking delicious it looks like as a fruit. It, I mean, I would love to try one. I don't know how
[19:10.190 --> 19:17.550]  available they are because it's a shitty fruit. It's like the thinnest layer of actual fruit bit.
[19:17.650 --> 19:26.490]  It is like 95% seed. Hey, you asked me to throw away the ones that look like they'd be disgusting.
[19:26.630 --> 19:33.310]  I'd throw away like the coffee bit. Look at how delicious that looks. It just stumbled across that.
[19:34.230 --> 19:38.350]  Remind me, uh, remind me while we're talking about fruit, uh, before, after we wrap this up,
[19:38.410 --> 19:43.810]  remind me, I have a fruit thing I want to, I want to switch into. Fruit gloves? No. Oh shit. Fruit gloves.
[19:45.350 --> 19:50.530]  I mean, you can take it away with your fruit if you want to. I was thinking, what, is that what?
[19:50.990 --> 19:56.530]  Is it the monkeys eat that shit? Like they eat the fruit and then we cook their poo to coffee?
[19:56.710 --> 20:03.230]  The little civet thing? What's that? Oh, I guess it would be. It's a cat. A civet is a cat.
[20:03.790 --> 20:10.510]  Oh, I thought it was monkey shite. Yeah, I think it's cat shit. But, um, but yeah, it must be that
[20:10.510 --> 20:15.230]  they like that fruit. What a cutie. Nick shot that out of a cannon earlier today.
[20:17.790 --> 20:23.210]  You said that's a cat? Uh, yeah, it is a, uh, small, lean, mostly nocturnal mammal.
[20:23.630 --> 20:30.550]  Got hands. Tropical Asia and Africa. Wow. Civet, civet. Civet's cute. And I think it's not, uh,
[20:31.150 --> 20:38.050]  not like a good thing to eat. Yeah, I don't think it's a healthy process for them. I think that
[20:38.050 --> 20:42.870]  there's a lot of concerns about it not being good for the civets. It's like that thing where like,
[20:42.950 --> 20:46.190]  they feed ducks a lot of stuff and then you eat like their liver. You kind of, it's like the same
[20:46.190 --> 20:51.110]  thing, like making that thing eat coffee. Goose liver shit. Yeah. Are there certain animals you
[20:51.110 --> 20:57.270]  don't care about? This is, now we're talking. Now we're getting into it. Mosquito, I didn't give a
[20:57.270 --> 21:05.290]  shit about them. Yeah, that's good. Absolute turbo genocide. I'm all for. I just rewatched,
[21:05.290 --> 21:12.010]  or I didn't rewatch, I watched the, I watched the Chris Pratt Jurassic Park movies and the last
[21:12.010 --> 21:17.690]  two especially are really reliant on you thinking the dinosaurs should live and deserve to exist,
[21:18.110 --> 21:23.290]  and I just don't give a fuck about them at all. I want them all to die. Yeah. But on its, on its
[21:23.290 --> 21:30.130]  face, it goes against its very thesis, which is, well, these things need to be able to live. And
[21:30.130 --> 21:33.310]  then you go, well, no, they got it. They went extinct one time. We can just bring them back
[21:33.310 --> 21:39.110]  again. That's it. I don't. It's terrible. Yeah. I don't like any of it. I don't like that they
[21:39.110 --> 21:44.570]  domesticated raptors. It'd be like Predator 2 having a predator. I don't like any of it.
[21:44.810 --> 21:49.910]  Yeah. I want them to be dumb killing machines. I don't like the fact that it's just allowed in
[21:49.910 --> 21:54.570]  that world that there are now flying dinosaurs, pterodactyls and shit. And you're just like in
[21:54.570 --> 21:58.350]  an American Airlines plane and you're like, oh, look out the window. It's a let's hope that
[21:58.350 --> 22:03.450]  pterodactyl is not hungry. Oh, no, it is. Yeah, I don't buy it. I don't. The six trillion dollar
[22:03.450 --> 22:07.250]  military budget. We can get rid of pterodactyls. I ain't worried about pterodactyls. Wasn't the
[22:07.250 --> 22:12.970]  whole plot of the first movie. Hey, you shouldn't play God. Yes. Yeah. So why are we on the side of
[22:12.970 --> 22:18.810]  the dinosaurs? Because it's movie seven. Yeah. They got bored. There was a guy who had a gun
[22:18.810 --> 22:21.610]  and he pointed the gun at people and the gun didn't shoot bullets. It shot dinosaur.
[22:22.130 --> 22:25.290]  How many times are you going to tell that same fucking story? You got to mix it up. Yeah.
[22:25.450 --> 22:30.750]  Does the lunchbox still exist? Yeah, I just opened some in Fallout 76 last night, actually.
[22:31.870 --> 22:37.670]  But that is a modern thing for today's school kids. Oh, yeah. Oh, well, like a lunch bag like
[22:37.670 --> 22:43.450]  they're they're like Millie has them or had them and you would like freeze it overnight and then
[22:43.450 --> 22:48.190]  you take it out and then put this shit in it. I think Jurassic Park, I think Jurassic Park
[22:48.190 --> 22:56.210]  lunchbox. Really? Yeah, I think B.B. Wong. Did you have a Jurassic Park lunchbox? Yeah. And I had
[22:56.210 --> 23:04.550]  Thunderbirds. Oh, wow. The more recent film Thunderbirds or the old Thunderbirds? No, old puppets.
[23:05.710 --> 23:13.050]  Nice. F.A.B. Very cool. Did you did you have any Thunderbirds posters on your wall?
[23:13.930 --> 23:17.910]  I had no posters, but I did have a little model of Thunderbird two and you could drop the middle
[23:17.910 --> 23:22.190]  and Thunderbird four would come out. Gracie just posted a Curious George lunchbox. I think I may
[23:22.190 --> 23:29.090]  have had the same. Nice. Oh, that Eric, that is very that that reads that checks. That's the one
[23:29.090 --> 23:35.570]  that I had. I had the Simpsons lunchbox in 1991 or whatever. Just real quick, I want to circle back
[23:35.570 --> 23:38.410]  that while we were talking about dinosaurs and animals you don't care about, Gracie just started
[23:38.410 --> 23:47.090]  listing them in the chat. Birds, pigeon crow, June bugs, crickets. I don't like any of those.
[23:47.650 --> 23:52.010]  I like the cricket noise. I think a cricket can create great atmosphere.
[23:52.730 --> 23:57.930]  You don't like the noise. I think I'm traumatized by it because over the summer,
[23:58.090 --> 24:01.750]  my apartment had a cricket infestation and I would wake up to them in the middle of the night
[24:01.750 --> 24:08.890]  in my room. Oh, so now I really hate them. OK, that's fair. And Gavin, no, I don't really mess
[24:08.890 --> 24:16.170]  with birds. They kind of freak me out. Don't mess with birds. I'm not a big fan. One flew
[24:16.170 --> 24:21.890]  really close to my face a couple of weeks ago. Have you ever been chased? Chased? Yeah. Have
[24:21.890 --> 24:26.830]  you ever been chased by a bird? Not to my memory, but I would not like to be. Yeah, they're scary.
[24:27.290 --> 24:32.530]  I love tiny little birds. Like a hummingbird? Maybe not that small, but one you'd find in like
[24:32.530 --> 24:37.510]  a PetSmart and it's like, wow, look how small that is. OK, like a little domesticated bird.
[24:37.510 --> 24:40.630]  Yeah. Like a goldfinch.
[24:43.350 --> 24:44.990]  I'll admire those from afar.
[24:46.350 --> 24:51.110]  So you don't hate them. I want nothing to do with it. But you don't trust. So you would never have
[24:51.110 --> 24:56.310]  a bird feeder. It's not. Oh, my God. I have 35 in my backyard because Emily.
[24:57.050 --> 25:02.370]  Or like hummingbird or like general feeders. It is like bird Thunderdome every day in my backyard.
[25:04.150 --> 25:08.850]  The pigeons, the morning doves and the blue jays going at it left and right. All the fucking
[25:08.850 --> 25:12.050]  little birds running around, picking up the pieces. It's like the squirrels get involved.
[25:12.270 --> 25:20.510]  It's it's like a giant cage match. I got mad squirrels. Yeah, I have a garbage bag that has
[25:20.510 --> 25:27.550]  probably like 16 containers of McDonald's fries in it on my patio. And I'm in constant fear whenever
[25:27.550 --> 25:32.010]  I remember that it's out there that I'm just going to wake up to a swarm of seagulls.
[25:32.010 --> 25:38.410]  Why? Why are they out there? When I thought that the nugget buddies were going away and I bought
[25:38.410 --> 25:45.210]  like 20 nugget buddy meals at one time in the past, I just it was too many fries. I couldn't.
[25:45.270 --> 25:50.050]  I could at least refrigerate. You can't preserve the fries. So they're just a bunch of fries out
[25:50.050 --> 25:56.530]  there. Oh, they're in a garbage bag. And I didn't feel like taking it down. So I put it to the side
[25:56.530 --> 26:02.190]  out my patio door. And then I just haven't. It's been winter, so I haven't gone on the patio
[26:02.630 --> 26:07.670]  and I just forget that it's there. You just go there right now. Frozen raw out there.
[26:08.170 --> 26:12.030]  Well, I mean, it's it's McDonald's fries. They're going to preserve. They would survive
[26:12.030 --> 26:16.510]  the fallout bombs. They're fine. They're not. He's also at the part in the smell curve where
[26:16.510 --> 26:22.150]  it doesn't emanate an odor. Oh, I never smelled anything. Yeah, it's gone. But I was worried about
[26:22.150 --> 26:26.890]  the bird smelling it. What if you went out there now and just huffed the bag? I know. Listen,
[26:28.410 --> 26:34.350]  my breathing tubes are not great as it is. I'm not. I feel like we're on the edge of recovery.
[26:34.490 --> 26:40.010]  I can't do that. It's too dangerous. Just throw three more months into your recovery.
[26:40.910 --> 26:46.310]  Hey, also, how cold is it? I need a temperature. We're talking about heat.
[26:46.470 --> 26:52.090]  It depends. Oh, yeah. I don't want to amplify the bag. Might not be dense enough or too dense.
[26:52.090 --> 26:55.950]  Talk about your fruit thing. Yeah, I was going to say, hey, last week, I think it was last week,
[26:56.050 --> 27:03.470]  we we recorded a couple of drafts, right? Yeah. Yeah. And obviously for the new thing. And it was
[27:03.470 --> 27:08.230]  some of the most fun I've had in a very long time. I forgot how much I enjoy doing the drafts and I
[27:08.230 --> 27:11.970]  want to keep that momentum going. And so I want to propose a new draft to you guys.
[27:13.870 --> 27:19.070]  And I think it'll be interesting because the pool I mean, the pool is always everything
[27:19.570 --> 27:24.170]  in the world that fits the category. Right. But I feel like the pool for this one is naturally a
[27:24.170 --> 27:29.450]  little smaller. And I think that we all have heated opinions about these things. So I propose
[27:29.450 --> 27:34.330]  to you guys. And there's a part two to it. I propose to you guys, we do a fruit draft.
[27:34.890 --> 27:39.890]  Yeah, no, we do. We do a fruit draft, right? We all draft our favorite fruit. And then at the end,
[27:39.890 --> 27:45.010]  we all take the four fruits that we've combined that we ended up with and we have to make them
[27:45.010 --> 27:48.930]  into a smoothie. And then we do a taste test to see whose smoothie tastes the best.
[27:49.630 --> 27:52.510]  Wow. So you're going to have to like, you can't just if someone takes your fruit,
[27:52.590 --> 27:55.670]  you can't just shove in any old fruit. You're going to have to have a complimentary fruit.
[27:55.950 --> 27:59.750]  I mean, I think that the taste test would have to come later in supplemental content, probably. But
[27:59.750 --> 28:05.250]  but yeah, that's essentially how that's great. I think that's a fantastic idea.
[28:05.690 --> 28:09.050]  Thank you. That's great. I was pretty excited about it. I figured that maybe that'd be something
[28:09.050 --> 28:12.750]  we do here in the next couple weeks. I also had an idea for a draft that I think
[28:12.750 --> 28:19.010]  is probably shit, but I want to throw it to the group. Okay. A question draft.
[28:19.390 --> 28:26.370]  What? What does that mean? The best questions. Oh, I like it.
[28:27.450 --> 28:33.550]  I mean, yeah, let's do it. Yeah. I'm not going to say no to a draft. Yeah. All right.
[28:34.570 --> 28:37.210]  I will say there was less enthusiasm from Andrew on the question.
[28:37.210 --> 28:41.470]  It's absolute less enthusiasm. That was me processing. I don't have my brain around it
[28:41.470 --> 28:47.630]  at this point, but I trust Gavin. And so I'm all about it. Andrew has to figure out a way how to
[28:47.630 --> 28:51.910]  cheat it. He's just going to take. Yeah, I yeah, definitely. Oh, can I just put a question mark at
[28:51.910 --> 28:57.510]  the end of a regular sentence? Do you think that there's probably like a number one, like a number
[28:57.510 --> 29:02.210]  one question? Yeah, I can think of some good ones, but I feel like even today we've we've had
[29:02.210 --> 29:12.570]  does a raccoon have thumbs? Great question. Why is there no cold sauce? I have the I don't want
[29:12.570 --> 29:17.730]  to ask my questions here because I want to save them for the draft. I have a draft idea that was
[29:17.730 --> 29:21.890]  inspired. I had this thought. Well, Jeff, you're you're explaining your draft idea.
[29:21.970 --> 29:27.890]  Well, it's unrelated. Could we do a birds? Gracie likes the least draft and she just has to judge.
[29:28.490 --> 29:34.630]  She's the judge after. Doesn't have any, but yeah, but she has to has to be a hierarchy system.
[29:35.870 --> 29:41.950]  Like there are snakes I hate more than other snakes. Exactly. Like, well, each compile a gang
[29:41.950 --> 29:47.450]  of birds and then Gracie will say who had the worst gang. Which group would she least like to be
[29:47.450 --> 29:52.770]  around? And that's how we whoever wins. So we decide who wins. We had a lot of drafts. This is
[29:52.770 --> 30:00.150]  I'm excited. Make your next vacation unforgettable on Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the

[31:09.970 --> 31:12.610]  Uh, I wanna, before we get too deep in the episode, I feel like this is something important
[31:12.610 --> 31:18.030]  that I need to address. Um, I have uh, I've prepared a statement that I would like to
[31:18.030 --> 31:22.350]  read now if you guys would just, wouldn't mind just being quiet while I try to get through this.
[31:22.390 --> 31:24.450]  This might be a little difficult for me, but um...
[31:24.450 --> 31:25.890]  I'm gonna go get a glass of water, you start.
[31:26.530 --> 31:29.990]  Yeah, that's fine. Uh, all right, I'm just gonna go.
[31:30.790 --> 31:31.270]  Whew.
[31:32.250 --> 31:35.110]  Dear Boston Celtics and fans of the Boston Celtics,
[31:36.390 --> 31:42.950]  I am truly sorry, last night is my fault, it is on me, uh, please don't blame the team,
[31:43.450 --> 31:46.430]  don't blame the front office, please don't blame the referees,
[31:47.090 --> 31:51.870]  please don't blame the Miami Heat, it was definitely me, I chose the wrong socks yesterday
[31:51.870 --> 31:57.790]  morning, I knew the consequences that if I picked wrong, and I still did it, I took green, and I,
[31:57.790 --> 32:01.050]  something in the back of my head was like, you should wear the white socks today,
[32:01.210 --> 32:05.290]  because it's a home game, but I wore green because it's like a louder color, and I felt
[32:05.290 --> 32:11.190]  very loud in my, my, and proud about Boston, and the end result is we got our fucking asses kicked
[32:11.190 --> 32:16.810]  by ten points at home, because I didn't listen to my gut, and so I promise that I'm never gonna make
[32:16.810 --> 32:21.050]  a sock-related mistake again. Sincerely, Jeff Ramsey.
[32:21.670 --> 32:25.270]  If you roasted them, would they be brown?
[32:28.550 --> 32:30.970]  If we lose to the Heat, I might have to do that.
[32:33.110 --> 32:36.530]  We have sports, and if you want to go into sports, I'm sorry, Jeff, that they lost,
[32:36.570 --> 32:39.410]  I was shocked to see that they lost by such a large margin.
[32:39.570 --> 32:44.430]  Well, now you know why, now you know why, because I was standing in my closet yesterday morning
[32:44.430 --> 32:49.270]  thinking, if you fuck this up for the Celtics, they lose tonight because you chose the green
[32:49.270 --> 32:52.610]  socks, and then the other part of me was like, nah, that's superstitious, don't be stupid,
[32:52.970 --> 32:57.430]  you're 40, almost 49 years old, and I fucking knew better, I should, anyway.
[32:57.790 --> 33:03.710]  I had a similar experience with the Canucks, as you may remember, at the beginning of the season,
[33:03.710 --> 33:09.750]  I talked about making an alternate, like a burner account, just to complain about the Canucks,
[33:09.870 --> 33:16.490]  my caviar phone, and I bought the caviar phone in the form of an UbiDigi, but the Canucks,
[33:16.590 --> 33:21.630]  for most of the year, were the number one team in the NHL, unexpectedly, nobody saw this coming,
[33:21.630 --> 33:28.610]  they were elite, and so I never wanted to address it, or acknowledge hockey in any way,
[33:28.810 --> 33:33.870]  people would ask about it, because I thought, if I say no, I don't have a caviar account,
[33:34.410 --> 33:37.030]  then I will immediately need one, and the team will be terrible.
[33:37.730 --> 33:44.250]  And we made it all the way to the playoffs, and I got to enjoy one game, and then the star goalie
[33:44.250 --> 33:49.170]  got hurt, and he's gone, he's done for the season. Playoffs are dead. I got to have one
[33:49.170 --> 33:54.490]  game of joy, and hope, and I fought the whole year, being like, I'm not going to fall for it,
[33:54.530 --> 33:59.890]  I'm not going to buy into this, and I bought into it, and it's already full of shit.
[34:00.790 --> 34:04.070]  So, I'm equally, I don't have a sock issue, Jeff, I just have no hope at all.
[34:04.370 --> 34:07.310]  At least you have a sock to pick. It's just, it's over.
[34:08.670 --> 34:09.470]  I'm really sorry, man.
[34:09.470 --> 34:09.630]  It's done.
[34:09.910 --> 34:10.270]  That's hard.
[34:10.270 --> 34:14.730]  Yeah. It's, you know, maybe we'll get out of the first round, we'll see.
[34:14.730 --> 34:24.350]  We'll see. I'm gonna be dumb, and have hope still, but, ugh. Sports suck. Sports are terrible.
[34:25.170 --> 34:25.330]  Yeah.
[34:26.370 --> 34:27.310]  There's pain.
[34:28.930 --> 34:34.850]  Do you think anyone will be, ever be able to find your old light? Like, if...
[34:36.130 --> 34:36.670]  Like...
[34:36.670 --> 34:36.750]  What?
[34:37.150 --> 34:37.450]  What happened?
[34:38.150 --> 34:44.270]  Imagine a, say there was a street light shining on you, when you were about to kick the child,
[34:44.270 --> 34:44.670]  right?
[34:46.090 --> 34:49.810]  And the light was, you know, bouncing off everything, bouncing off you, and just went out
[34:49.810 --> 34:55.990]  into space. Are you worried that if we ever could travel faster than light,
[34:56.090 --> 35:00.430]  people will get ahead of that light and be able to see you almost doing it?
[35:01.650 --> 35:02.010]  No.
[35:02.550 --> 35:08.090]  I don't care. Have you ever done anything else outside that you would be scared of people seeing?
[35:12.110 --> 35:12.470]  Um...
[35:12.470 --> 35:14.850]  Almost everything I've done outside, I'd be scared of people seeing.
[35:15.330 --> 35:20.390]  Yeah, I'm trying to think of like... There was one time, there was a giant mossy rock,
[35:20.450 --> 35:23.910]  and I spent a whole day taking the moss off, because I convinced myself it was a Pokemon.
[35:27.390 --> 35:30.010]  You convinced yourself a rock was a Pokemon?
[35:30.530 --> 35:34.010]  Yeah, I thought if I got all the moss out, it would spawn a Pokemon, because it was like a,
[35:34.390 --> 35:37.450]  I don't know, a six. A six in a forest.
[35:38.890 --> 35:39.570]  Were you alone?
[35:39.730 --> 35:42.630]  One time, I was given a really fancy rug. Yeah, I was alone. I'd spent a lot of time
[35:42.630 --> 35:49.990]  in the woods alone. I was given a really fancy rug, that like a family friend traveled to India,
[35:50.090 --> 35:55.550]  and that was their gift back for me, was this nice rug. And I took it into the woods and ruined it
[35:56.290 --> 36:01.870]  immediately, because I had a little wooden house. And I just put it out in the dirt.
[36:02.150 --> 36:07.230]  I mean, part of that might be on the family friends for giving a six-year-old a rug as a gift.
[36:07.230 --> 36:10.570]  I was probably like eight at the time. You just wanted to play with it, you know?
[36:11.070 --> 36:14.090]  Yeah, I did. I really thought it would really bring the woods together.
[36:17.190 --> 36:18.670]  Really tie the woods together.
[36:19.110 --> 36:22.790]  My parents advised me against it and saying it would ruin it. And I was like,
[36:22.830 --> 36:24.970]  no, it's going to be great. And then immediately it was ruined.
[36:25.210 --> 36:26.490]  Oh, you ran this by them?
[36:27.870 --> 36:29.070]  Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
[36:29.350 --> 36:30.390]  Oh, well, this is on them then.
[36:30.990 --> 36:34.490]  Well, no, they told me they're like, hey, you're going to ruin this gift that you were given.
[36:35.010 --> 36:36.590]  They were letting him learn a life lesson.
[36:37.230 --> 36:42.010]  Yeah. I don't know what I learned. I guess don't put rugs in the woods.
[36:42.070 --> 36:45.330]  But I don't think I've been a lot of opportunities.
[36:45.490 --> 36:46.290]  Do you think it's still there?
[36:46.670 --> 36:51.330]  I don't know, because that has largely turned into houses.
[36:51.710 --> 36:56.470]  It was it was an undeveloped subdivision at the time.
[36:57.170 --> 37:00.650]  But I bet you that my little wood house is no longer there.
[37:01.030 --> 37:02.610]  Oh, here's the video of somebody.
[37:02.730 --> 37:05.010]  Somebody found and recovered your rug and cleaned it.
[37:05.010 --> 37:08.090]  Oh, yeah. A rug cleaning video is great.
[37:08.210 --> 37:09.270]  Oh, they can be so satisfying.
[37:09.530 --> 37:10.150]  Those are the best.
[37:10.790 --> 37:12.390]  I don't trust them, though. I think they're all fake.
[37:12.750 --> 37:14.950]  Yeah, I wish I could believe everything's fake.
[37:15.570 --> 37:16.550]  What's fake about it?
[37:16.990 --> 37:19.790]  I think that they've made it as dirty as possible.
[37:20.150 --> 37:22.730]  Yeah, it's they're superfluously dirty. It's like.
[37:22.830 --> 37:24.810]  Yeah, it's like it's like fake dirty, too.
[37:24.890 --> 37:27.810]  It's like superficial, like none of it's like actually in there.
[37:27.830 --> 37:29.710]  Like it's kind of dirty, but it's not that dirty.
[37:30.130 --> 37:30.430]  Get real.
[37:30.470 --> 37:33.850]  It's like some of those old like tool restoration videos, but they're all just backwards.
[37:33.850 --> 37:35.730]  They're like people making it dirty.
[37:40.010 --> 37:44.610]  But I'm getting close to just being a accepting what I see on the Internet guy
[37:45.230 --> 37:47.350]  because it's almost certainly going to be fake.
[37:47.350 --> 37:51.490]  But it like it doesn't change my life negatively if I just believed it was real.
[37:51.890 --> 37:55.090]  There's no consequence for at least the stuff that I'm watching.
[37:55.710 --> 37:58.370]  I'm working on just deciding that everything is real.
[37:58.730 --> 38:01.290]  I'm I'm scared and going the other way.
[38:01.290 --> 38:04.250]  Yesterday on TikTok, I got served up two videos.
[38:04.530 --> 38:11.130]  One was LeBron James at a press conference post-loss talking shit about D-Lo.
[38:11.590 --> 38:14.250]  And it took me about three seconds to go, Oh, this is A.I.
[38:14.990 --> 38:17.010]  This is fuck his eyes because his voice sounded weird.
[38:17.070 --> 38:18.590]  Then I realized I was looking at A.I.
[38:18.670 --> 38:20.750]  And it's like, that's fucking scary.
[38:21.330 --> 38:28.550]  And then I saw a clip of Will Smith and Chris Rock like having a discussion face to face
[38:28.550 --> 38:29.650]  about the slap.
[38:30.110 --> 38:32.810]  And it just what they were saying didn't quite make sense.
[38:32.830 --> 38:35.610]  And then about five seconds in, I went, Oh, fuck, this is A.I.
[38:35.610 --> 38:39.190]  to having both of those served up at me at the same on the same day.
[38:39.190 --> 38:43.370]  I was like, we're like six months away from never being able to tell the truth ever again.
[38:44.910 --> 38:45.130]  That's it.
[38:45.150 --> 38:46.970]  I don't care about either of those things, though.
[38:47.690 --> 38:48.870]  So once again, argue my point.
[38:48.950 --> 38:50.930]  Like, I know there's always talked about at the same time.
[38:50.970 --> 38:51.230]  I'm sorry.
[38:51.270 --> 38:51.630]  What was that?
[38:51.750 --> 38:52.490]  Yeah, yeah, I don't care.
[38:52.670 --> 38:53.710]  Gavin quiet for a second.
[38:54.320 --> 39:00.110]  Um, I'm trying a new approach instead of saying you go.
[39:01.530 --> 39:05.770]  That obviously could be an extreme that is used terribly.
[39:06.050 --> 39:08.590]  But I don't care about either of the things you described.
[39:08.790 --> 39:11.550]  I'm OK believing that LeBron James said whatever he said.
[39:11.990 --> 39:14.950]  And I'm OK believing that Chris Rock and Will Smith talked about the slap.
[39:15.070 --> 39:18.710]  And it's not it's not those two individuals in general.
[39:18.730 --> 39:23.010]  It's that some asshole in his spare time thought it would be funny to make it and
[39:23.010 --> 39:24.690]  throw it up on the Internet in two seconds.
[39:24.810 --> 39:28.950]  And it's happening with such frequency and such ease that I'm getting it served up
[39:28.950 --> 39:31.090]  multiple times in like one 10 minute session.
[39:31.210 --> 39:36.030]  And it may not be shit that any of us care about, but it will be.
[39:36.490 --> 39:37.230]  It will be.
[39:37.270 --> 39:39.290]  Have you considered just not having opinions?
[39:40.230 --> 39:43.010]  Yeah, I mean, I it's all.
[39:43.150 --> 39:46.390]  Listen, when I take my vow of silence, what is there to have an opinion on or who to tell?
[39:46.470 --> 39:50.770]  You know, how far would you go in life without ever expressing an opinion?
[39:51.330 --> 39:53.050]  I think you just breeze through.
[39:53.210 --> 39:54.230]  Yeah, I bet you could.
[39:54.990 --> 39:56.910]  There'd be no resistance to anything.
[39:57.050 --> 39:59.210]  Wait, you just breeze through life?
[39:59.550 --> 39:59.810]  Yeah.
[40:00.010 --> 40:02.030]  Like you're like you're getting to the end.
[40:02.510 --> 40:04.710]  It feels like this should have been conflict.
[40:05.030 --> 40:11.570]  It feels like this should have been like a Jim Carrey, Tony Shalhoub movie in the early 2000s.
[40:12.050 --> 40:14.310]  He's like the guy who can't make a decision.
[40:15.050 --> 40:15.270]  Yep.
[40:15.370 --> 40:16.470]  Just be caught on the fence.
[40:16.770 --> 40:17.870]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[40:18.170 --> 40:19.130]  This is good.
[40:19.390 --> 40:20.570]  This is very good.
[40:20.770 --> 40:23.170]  Somebody AI Jim Carrey and on the fence, please.
[40:23.310 --> 40:25.890]  On the fence with Jim Carrey and Tony Shalhoub.
[40:28.510 --> 40:32.350]  I have I mean, I don't ask questions and it's an annoyance for me.
[40:32.670 --> 40:33.530]  You don't?
[40:33.950 --> 40:34.730]  I don't know.
[40:34.950 --> 40:37.590]  I ask an alarming lack of questions.
[40:38.130 --> 40:41.030]  It's like the cat, the painting the cat thing is a perfect example.
[40:41.190 --> 40:41.270]  Right.
[40:41.770 --> 40:44.490]  I will just accept what is given to me generally.
[40:45.290 --> 40:48.650]  Or I might doubt it, but I won't vocalize any questions about it.
[40:48.650 --> 40:53.150]  There are things in my life that I think about all the time that I could get a resolution to,
[40:53.330 --> 40:55.770]  but I'm not going to ask the question for that resolution.
[40:55.970 --> 40:56.910]  So I just continue to wait.
[40:57.410 --> 41:00.050]  Are any of the questions for us that you could sort out right now?
[41:01.370 --> 41:02.170]  Uh, no.
[41:02.170 --> 41:05.630]  Or do you want to hang on to any of the questions for the question draft?
[41:07.030 --> 41:08.410]  No, no, I don't.
[41:08.730 --> 41:10.230]  Well, some of them maybe actually.
[41:10.650 --> 41:12.810]  No, the primary one, no.
[41:13.230 --> 41:15.150]  That's why you weren't excited about my draft idea.
[41:15.450 --> 41:16.690]  You're not a questions guy.
[41:16.970 --> 41:18.270]  He's not a questions guy.
[41:18.270 --> 41:20.030]  I started leaving it answers, man.
[41:20.690 --> 41:24.010]  Do you feel like there's a point where you stopped asking questions?
[41:24.230 --> 41:25.870]  Like was it cold turkey?
[41:26.410 --> 41:30.170]  Was it a conscious decision or did it like taper off or has this been a consistent thing?
[41:30.870 --> 41:33.270]  I think I at some point in my life just decided
[41:33.270 --> 41:37.790]  if the person wants me to know the information, they will give me that information.
[41:38.150 --> 41:40.890]  And so I just am not going to ask about anything.
[41:42.090 --> 41:42.530]  I've...
[41:42.530 --> 41:43.630]  There are times where I should be.
[41:43.630 --> 41:49.230]  I've made the the conscious decision to stop correcting people when they're wrong about anything
[41:49.230 --> 41:52.870]  because you always just look like an asshole or smug.
[41:53.050 --> 41:56.010]  And then it's funnier if they get to go through life being wrong.
[41:56.130 --> 41:59.070]  You have any examples of that of like somebody you think about?
[41:59.250 --> 42:00.710]  Wow, they were wrong and I didn't correct them.
[42:00.810 --> 42:03.170]  And it's probably happens multiple times.
[42:03.270 --> 42:05.250]  It's probably happened three or four times with you today.
[42:06.070 --> 42:07.450]  I can't think of anything specific.
[42:07.810 --> 42:09.890]  Did you correct me on the vanilla thing?
[42:10.270 --> 42:11.090]  Or was that only Eric?
[42:11.930 --> 42:12.670]  No, that's me.
[42:12.670 --> 42:14.750]  That's why I can't relate to what the fuck Jeff is saying.
[42:14.890 --> 42:16.390]  That is the craziest shit I've ever heard.
[42:16.810 --> 42:17.250]  What do you mean?
[42:17.570 --> 42:18.550]  Like if somebody says...
[42:18.550 --> 42:19.230]  You just don't...
[42:19.230 --> 42:20.770]  Yeah, cinnamon and vanilla.
[42:21.210 --> 42:22.790]  It's like the same thing.
[42:23.250 --> 42:24.490]  And you just let it go?
[42:25.350 --> 42:30.430]  Oh, I couldn't think of what a vanilla bean looked like in my head at the time.
[42:30.510 --> 42:32.230]  And so I didn't want to...
[42:32.230 --> 42:33.430]  I didn't know where to land on it.
[42:33.430 --> 42:34.090]  So I just got quiet.
[42:34.190 --> 42:34.390]  Right.
[42:34.470 --> 42:36.930]  But if you did, you would have just let that go.
[42:37.610 --> 42:39.330]  Gavin sounded really confident.
[42:39.490 --> 42:41.430]  And I've learned not to second guess him.
[42:42.670 --> 42:44.170]  I don't think I sounded that confident.
[42:44.450 --> 42:47.870]  You sounded Pubert Adams confident.
[42:48.330 --> 42:50.430]  And I've been burned too many times.
[42:51.210 --> 42:51.610]  That's true.
[42:52.950 --> 42:57.350]  Gavin has owned every car I've owned for the last, like, fucking 10 years.
[42:59.490 --> 43:02.150]  Feel free to just buy me out of the car thing, though.
[43:02.190 --> 43:03.570]  And then you can finally have your car again.
[43:04.170 --> 43:05.110]  Yeah, we'll just...
[43:07.210 --> 43:07.650]  No.
[43:08.310 --> 43:09.190]  I'll give you a great deal.
[43:12.050 --> 43:14.930]  I like the arrangement we have going right now.
[43:14.990 --> 43:18.450]  I'll trade you your car for your best Indian rug.
[43:21.450 --> 43:22.310]  That's not what we're talking.
[43:23.150 --> 43:25.330]  You're going to end up with a fucking rug, though.
[43:26.010 --> 43:26.930]  I'm going to keep it indoors.
[43:27.030 --> 43:27.790]  I'm going to keep it nice.
[43:28.390 --> 43:31.650]  I want to go on Google Street View to my old house to see where am I...
[43:31.650 --> 43:33.190]  If I can see if it's still there.
[43:33.190 --> 43:34.290]  Oh, you should definitely do that.
[43:34.830 --> 43:36.610]  Oh, man, I have a fucking dog problem.
[43:36.790 --> 43:38.070]  I now have dog problems again.
[43:38.070 --> 43:39.650]  Oh, yeah.
[43:39.810 --> 43:40.230]  What's your problem?
[43:40.490 --> 43:42.610]  It's not shit related, which I'm real happy about.
[43:44.930 --> 43:48.570]  But I've been, you know, up late lately, just, like, stressed.
[43:48.750 --> 43:49.550]  It's a bit stressful.
[43:50.270 --> 43:53.950]  And there comes a point in time when, you know, you put the dog to bed.
[43:54.350 --> 43:56.270]  He sleeps in a crate, obviously, in the bedroom.
[43:56.670 --> 44:02.090]  And he starts snoring at about 1 a.m. every night.
[44:02.810 --> 44:06.130]  And if I'm not asleep before 1 a.m.,
[44:07.790 --> 44:09.270]  I can't go to sleep.
[44:09.990 --> 44:12.410]  It's like it's it's like it's like I have to thread it.
[44:12.510 --> 44:15.770]  You remember the episode of Always Sunny where Charlie and Frank had to get home
[44:15.770 --> 44:19.230]  and then eat cat food because it made him tired and then get to sleep
[44:19.230 --> 44:23.770]  before all the cats showed up to meow about smelling the cat food.
[44:23.950 --> 44:25.790]  And they had like a perfect window to sleep.
[44:25.950 --> 44:28.270]  I have that now with the dog that I have to thread.
[44:29.750 --> 44:32.870]  And and if I miss the window, I have to go sleep on the couch.
[44:33.190 --> 44:35.210]  I've slept on the couch like three times in the past week.
[44:36.130 --> 44:40.190]  Because I just I just lay at the ceiling and listen to the dog.
[44:40.250 --> 44:43.230]  And I can't hit his crate or wake him up because if I wake him up,
[44:43.250 --> 44:45.050]  he'll start crying and be like, I gotta go to the bathroom.
[44:45.290 --> 44:47.750]  And then I'm outside with the dog going to the bathroom.
[44:47.790 --> 44:50.190]  And then he just comes back in and goes back to sleep and start snoring again instantly.
[44:50.330 --> 44:51.630]  So I've just made double the work for myself.
[44:52.010 --> 44:55.090]  So my solution has just been I sleep on the sofa now most nights.
[44:56.030 --> 44:59.290]  Well, is there no way of rolling him over without waking him up?
[44:59.490 --> 45:00.330]  Absolutely not.
[45:01.110 --> 45:04.250]  He's going to get a surgery that will help him breathe a little better later
[45:04.650 --> 45:05.790]  in like three months.
[45:05.790 --> 45:07.350]  So maybe that'll change it.
[45:07.470 --> 45:10.390]  But as it is right now, I just have to be asleep by like 1245.
[45:10.730 --> 45:13.450]  And if I'm not, I don't even I shouldn't even bother going to the bedroom.
[45:13.850 --> 45:16.270]  And if he's out of the room and in the crate, what happens then?
[45:18.150 --> 45:19.050]  Well, he's a baby.
[45:19.130 --> 45:20.890]  I don't want him to have to be out of his bedroom.
[45:23.590 --> 45:24.430]  It's just a baby.
[45:24.570 --> 45:27.230]  I can I can go to bed earlier or sleep on the sofa.
[45:27.430 --> 45:27.690]  I don't know.
[45:27.810 --> 45:28.530]  It's just a baby.
[45:28.710 --> 45:31.870]  I was going to ask Gavin, do you have this problem with your cats at all?
[45:32.710 --> 45:34.290]  They have a second door.
[45:34.290 --> 45:38.370]  Yeah, but the buffer door between their bedroom to help them sleep.
[45:38.530 --> 45:39.690]  And fingerprint handles.
[45:39.850 --> 45:43.890]  Yeah, I got all kinds of problems, but I don't have to lock them all out though.
[45:44.390 --> 45:46.230]  To be fair, they're not babies.
[45:46.770 --> 45:47.590]  Yeah, he's just a baby.
[45:48.330 --> 45:49.810]  He's only seven months old.
[45:50.510 --> 45:53.330]  Oh man, my my wood house is so gone.
[45:53.710 --> 45:54.690]  It's so dead.
[45:55.710 --> 45:57.130]  What is it now?
[45:57.850 --> 45:58.390]  House.
[45:59.090 --> 46:00.630]  It's backyard and house.
[46:00.910 --> 46:01.930]  It's actual house.
[46:02.510 --> 46:03.510]  It is upgraded.
[46:04.290 --> 46:05.070]  I have a life hack.
[46:05.590 --> 46:06.410]  Oh, hell yeah.
[46:06.690 --> 46:08.370]  Yeah, it's a gaming life hack.
[46:08.690 --> 46:10.050]  I was playing Sea of Thieves.
[46:10.630 --> 46:12.850]  I've been deep into Sea of Thieves recently.
[46:13.330 --> 46:14.830]  You missed a great let's play today, Gavin.
[46:15.190 --> 46:16.470]  Oh, he did.
[46:16.670 --> 46:22.470]  But unrelated to that, just general news the evening I was going around the map and there
[46:22.470 --> 46:26.890]  are these kind of beacons you can go to that indicate you have to fight some enemies and
[46:26.890 --> 46:27.710]  get a bunch of loot.
[46:28.090 --> 46:29.390]  And so it's heading that way.
[46:29.530 --> 46:33.210]  And there is a boat that was nearby already.
[46:33.770 --> 46:36.790]  And I went up and I was like, you know, and hey, I'm friendly.
[46:37.170 --> 46:38.310]  Let's be in an alliance.
[46:38.370 --> 46:43.230]  The guy's using the in-game chat for this, and they immediately attacked me and were dicks
[46:43.230 --> 46:43.990]  and sunk me.
[46:44.350 --> 46:45.610]  And I was like, those fucks.
[46:46.590 --> 46:49.070]  And when you sink your boat, respond somewhere else in the map.
[46:49.350 --> 46:54.390]  It happened to spawn at literally the closest island to them that it could possibly spawn
[46:54.390 --> 46:54.650]  at.
[46:54.990 --> 46:56.770]  And there was a rowboat on that island.
[46:57.050 --> 47:02.230]  So I decided I'm going to paddle my way all the way over to their ship and then try to
[47:02.230 --> 47:05.190]  their powder kegs and stuff or they're like bombs.
[47:05.790 --> 47:10.210]  I'm going to try to blow up their boat because if they sunk me, I'm sure they have some stuff.
[47:10.510 --> 47:11.570]  Maybe I can get them back.
[47:11.730 --> 47:15.290]  So I spend like 10 minutes rowing and I'm being all tactical.
[47:15.630 --> 47:17.510]  I mean, sneaking, I'm rolling behind rocks.
[47:17.770 --> 47:21.410]  I swim over to their boat and I start to climb the ladder onto their ship.
[47:21.730 --> 47:26.870]  And one of them is just waiting with a gun pointed at me and they immediately shoot me.
[47:26.930 --> 47:27.810]  I panic.
[47:28.050 --> 47:29.530]  I run through the fort.
[47:29.630 --> 47:30.990]  I'm zigzagging left and right.
[47:30.990 --> 47:32.450]  I dive and I hide.
[47:32.690 --> 47:38.570]  And then I just I emote into the sand so they can't see me and I wait and I'm so nervous
[47:38.570 --> 47:41.430]  and I'm starting to like peek around a little bit.
[47:41.610 --> 47:46.190]  I probably just hide for like 10 minutes and then I start moving around and I decide I need
[47:46.190 --> 47:47.990]  to try to get closer to their ship.
[47:48.550 --> 47:54.010]  So I move a little bit further into the fort and there is a wooden kind of ramp walkway
[47:54.010 --> 47:55.570]  that I could hide under.
[47:55.570 --> 48:01.090]  So I ran into that and then I put into my sleep emote like, where are these guys?
[48:01.230 --> 48:01.890]  And I'm looking around.
[48:02.090 --> 48:04.170]  I have game clips of this, a bunch of it.
[48:04.350 --> 48:10.170]  I'm looking around and as I'm spinning my camera, I see their ship perfectly line up
[48:10.170 --> 48:11.390]  directly behind me.
[48:11.750 --> 48:15.350]  I can see it through the wooden wall that has a bunch of like chips in it.
[48:15.750 --> 48:20.390]  I can see their boat and I'm like, oh no, they're parking literally where I'm hiding
[48:20.390 --> 48:24.630]  and they're going to run past me so many times setting up the ship.
[48:24.630 --> 48:29.070]  Because typically what people do is they'll run the chest to the beach, put it down and
[48:29.070 --> 48:30.630]  then harpoon it onto their boat.
[48:30.690 --> 48:31.570]  So it's faster.
[48:31.910 --> 48:36.650]  And I had a view of the harpoon, so I thought I can just lay here and I'll just watch the
[48:36.650 --> 48:37.030]  harpoon.
[48:37.710 --> 48:41.490]  I grabbed five flame grenades from the rowboat on the way there.
[48:41.650 --> 48:46.610]  So I'm just waiting for them to get that gunpowder in and then I'm going to throw a fire at them
[48:46.610 --> 48:48.370]  and just hope that that window appears.
[48:48.890 --> 48:52.950]  But the harpoon is so quick, I can't make out what they're pulling in or not.
[48:53.510 --> 48:55.510]  And I decided this is the life hack.
[48:55.830 --> 49:01.390]  I decided I'm going to look at my recent players and just see if I can get any intel on these
[49:01.390 --> 49:01.710]  guys.
[49:01.870 --> 49:06.990]  And I had two people that it said I had met recently, like within the last three minutes.
[49:07.150 --> 49:08.150]  I clicked one.
[49:08.390 --> 49:10.010]  There wasn't really any info on it.
[49:10.330 --> 49:11.810]  But then I clicked the second one.
[49:11.910 --> 49:18.370]  And on Xbox, you are able to sync external profiles to your gamer tag.
[49:18.370 --> 49:23.950]  And this man had a Discord account and a Twitch account and had a link account tabs.
[49:24.050 --> 49:24.870]  And I went, oh, shit.
[49:25.130 --> 49:29.150]  So I clicked his Discord and then immediately he was streaming.
[49:29.270 --> 49:32.670]  He is live streaming this whole thing that I brought up on my computer.
[49:33.050 --> 49:35.210]  And he was the guy that was loading the boat.
[49:35.350 --> 49:38.810]  So I now had eyes and ears on what this crew was doing.
[49:38.830 --> 49:43.130]  And I'm just laying, listening to the stream, watching, seeing what they're doing.
[49:43.290 --> 49:44.510]  They're moving stuff around.
[49:44.530 --> 49:46.270]  They're talking about me a little bit.
[49:46.890 --> 49:50.410]  Uh, and to be completely honest, I found this guy to be kind of annoying.
[49:50.650 --> 49:51.590]  He's doing voices.
[49:52.050 --> 49:52.950]  Didn't really like it.
[49:53.030 --> 49:54.070]  Wasn't having a great time.
[49:54.670 --> 49:59.890]  But then like a movie, I'm probably I've been waiting like 30 minutes at this point in the sand.
[50:00.050 --> 50:01.410]  Just watching the stream.
[50:02.070 --> 50:04.010]  One of them says it's a crew of three.
[50:04.310 --> 50:09.830]  One of the people in the crew says, I need the commendations for for delivering gunpowder
[50:09.830 --> 50:10.250]  barrels.
[50:10.650 --> 50:11.530]  Should we load them up?
[50:12.310 --> 50:16.610]  And there was one of them on the crew that was by far the best player.
[50:16.830 --> 50:18.910]  And he wrote in the text chat, no.
[50:19.730 --> 50:21.350]  And then I went off, damn it.
[50:21.550 --> 50:24.970]  But then the guy doubled down and said, come on, you know, I need them.
[50:25.270 --> 50:26.330]  You need them.
[50:26.790 --> 50:28.410]  We could load the boat with them.
[50:28.810 --> 50:31.630]  And then the guy was like, OK, fine, you can do it.
[50:32.110 --> 50:36.470]  And like a movie, because the guy that was streaming doesn't play Sea of Thieves a lot.
[50:36.530 --> 50:38.130]  So they were like explaining stuff to him.
[50:38.130 --> 50:44.410]  Like a movie, the guy that wanted to get the gunpowder barrel grabs the it is like a gunpowder
[50:44.410 --> 50:45.310]  barrel of legends.
[50:45.490 --> 50:47.430]  It's the most powerful gunpowder barrel in the game.
[50:47.570 --> 50:53.210]  And he says to the guy, yeah, you see that the gunpowder barrel legends, it's so effective,
[50:53.210 --> 50:57.050]  it will instantly sink the biggest ship in the game if it goes off on it.
[50:57.230 --> 51:00.070]  So I'm going to I'm going to put it in the crow's nest.
[51:00.110 --> 51:02.890]  So hopefully nobody says that.
[51:03.930 --> 51:05.190]  I was like, this is it.
[51:05.410 --> 51:06.250]  This is my time.
[51:06.490 --> 51:07.830]  So I come sprinting out.
[51:07.830 --> 51:08.830]  I have my grenades.
[51:09.190 --> 51:11.590]  I start throwing them everywhere on the boat.
[51:11.950 --> 51:14.850]  I see him climbing the ladder and then they're like, oh, he's here.
[51:14.930 --> 51:15.230]  He's here.
[51:15.270 --> 51:20.430]  He's throw fire and he jumps off the ship, but to try to prevent it from exploding.
[51:20.870 --> 51:24.830]  But it ends up exploding perfectly level in the hands next to the boat.
[51:24.950 --> 51:27.150]  It destroys their ship.
[51:27.490 --> 51:30.190]  They have like 60 or 70 gems.
[51:30.290 --> 51:35.250]  They have they've been playing for a long time and they're just filled with loot and
[51:35.250 --> 51:36.750]  it immediately sinks.
[51:36.750 --> 51:37.350]  I haven't.
[51:37.450 --> 51:39.550]  I unfortunately didn't have a clip of throwing the grenades.
[51:39.610 --> 51:41.350]  We have a clip of me being in their sinking boat.
[51:41.830 --> 51:43.610]  I kill the last guy.
[51:43.850 --> 51:45.150]  So now their boat's gone.
[51:45.310 --> 51:46.910]  But then they kill me.
[51:47.090 --> 51:49.710]  However, my boat is parked really close by.
[51:50.010 --> 51:53.490]  So I can just ride on over and start harpooning all their shit into my boat.
[51:54.950 --> 51:57.010]  But I'm listening to their stream.
[51:57.570 --> 52:02.170]  And so as I'm listening, I hear them go, oh, shit, he's coming.
[52:02.550 --> 52:06.490]  Grab like they grabbed the four things that they viewed was most valuable.
[52:06.750 --> 52:08.650]  And then started rowboating away.
[52:08.970 --> 52:11.990]  And we're like, we hope hopefully he doesn't see me.
[52:12.050 --> 52:13.870]  I'm like, I'm just watching this.
[52:13.910 --> 52:14.390]  It's great.
[52:15.450 --> 52:17.030]  And they're like, he's coming.
[52:17.190 --> 52:17.730]  We got to go.
[52:17.790 --> 52:18.630]  We got to find somewhere to go.
[52:18.650 --> 52:19.730]  Let's just go to this island.
[52:20.130 --> 52:26.350]  What they don't know is I am so just freaked out and like the adrenaline is flowing.
[52:26.670 --> 52:29.210]  I get lost and I go the wrong way.
[52:29.290 --> 52:30.650]  I end up in a storm.
[52:30.890 --> 52:32.790]  I go to the wrong outpost.
[52:33.050 --> 52:35.150]  I am fucking this up in every way.
[52:35.150 --> 52:38.650]  But they think that I'm like good and calculated because of what I've done.
[52:39.850 --> 52:41.810]  They rowboat to this island.
[52:42.070 --> 52:43.690]  And he's like, this is what we're going to do.
[52:44.050 --> 52:47.150]  We're going to bury our treasure so that way he won't know where it is.
[52:47.490 --> 52:50.450]  And let's put it all on top of each other in a row.
[52:50.630 --> 52:53.610]  So we know and it's easy for us, but he won't.
[52:53.650 --> 52:54.630]  And it's like, this is so funny.
[52:54.670 --> 52:56.830]  I can see I literally see where you're burying it.
[52:56.890 --> 52:57.610]  I know what you're doing.
[52:58.010 --> 53:00.350]  They're talking about hiding spots that I'd never find.
[53:00.370 --> 53:00.870]  It was great.
[53:01.670 --> 53:05.790]  I eventually I fuck up so bad I had to do a figure eight.
[53:06.290 --> 53:09.170]  I get to where I sunk them and I took so long.
[53:09.370 --> 53:11.670]  All of the shit has just sunk to the sea.
[53:11.950 --> 53:15.570]  I didn't get any of the stuff that was on their boat, but neither the day.
[53:15.910 --> 53:17.310]  And so then I loaded up.
[53:17.370 --> 53:21.230]  They were about 80% of the way done unloading from the vault that they had opened.
[53:21.350 --> 53:23.850]  I got the rest of it and I continue to watch the stream.
[53:24.270 --> 53:26.390]  They handled it very well, losing all their stuff.
[53:26.490 --> 53:28.870]  They lost more than I've ever lost in one time.
[53:28.870 --> 53:30.870]  And they handled it way better than I would have.
[53:31.330 --> 53:33.250]  One of them was like, ah, that's just how it goes.
[53:33.810 --> 53:34.890]  I'm done for the night.
[53:35.310 --> 53:38.050]  And then the two of them kept playing for a little bit.
[53:38.110 --> 53:41.470]  And then maybe like five minutes later, the guy that was streaming said,
[53:42.450 --> 53:43.870]  I'm done for the night.
[53:43.890 --> 53:44.690]  Like, this is fun.
[53:44.770 --> 53:46.110]  I think I'm going to take a little break.
[53:46.170 --> 53:47.090]  Thank you for watching.
[53:47.710 --> 53:48.570]  Have a good night, everybody.
[53:48.670 --> 53:49.870]  I'm going to I'm going to set up.
[53:50.010 --> 53:51.850]  I'm going to redirect you to some other stream.
[53:52.350 --> 53:56.290]  And so then I signed into my Twitch account and I I wrote good night.
[53:56.850 --> 54:02.170]  And then they they went, Andrew Panton, you're the guy I killed.
[54:03.030 --> 54:05.090]  I was like, I've been watching the whole time.
[54:05.150 --> 54:06.510]  That's how I got all my shit.
[54:06.770 --> 54:07.870]  I've been bugged in.
[54:08.030 --> 54:08.830]  I've been watching.
[54:09.870 --> 54:12.590]  He said, oh, man, good play.
[54:12.830 --> 54:14.070]  Good job by you.
[54:14.970 --> 54:16.070]  And then there was a pause.
[54:16.070 --> 54:20.530]  And then in a very dejected way, he said, can I at least get a follow for this?
[54:20.890 --> 54:23.630]  Because I was one of two people watching his stream.
[54:23.990 --> 54:25.350]  It's not a big streamer.
[54:25.350 --> 54:27.850]  This is a small I obliged.
[54:28.030 --> 54:29.850]  And I was hoping that he would post the VOD.
[54:30.230 --> 54:31.050]  It's not up.
[54:31.110 --> 54:33.870]  I don't think that would rule if there was a way to watch that.
[54:34.530 --> 54:40.070]  Yeah, but I was hoping I could clip his realizing that I've been in his chat the entire time.
[54:40.450 --> 54:43.350]  That is how I was able to say it was just so cinematic.
[54:43.570 --> 54:47.990]  The guy being like convincing them to load this powerful bomb and being like,
[54:48.070 --> 54:50.610]  this bomb is the most powerful bomb in the game.
[54:50.690 --> 54:53.050]  Hopefully they don't know where I'm going to put it because I'm putting it here.
[54:53.050 --> 54:55.450]  And the other guy saying no immediately.
[54:55.850 --> 54:56.910]  And then finally caving.
[54:57.390 --> 54:57.630]  Yeah.
[54:57.850 --> 54:58.630]  Oh, it was perfect.
[54:58.770 --> 55:02.670]  And that is why I love that game because it it can beat you down.
[55:02.850 --> 55:07.750]  Like I lost 2.5 hours of progress because I got sunk and I didn't get anything for it.
[55:07.970 --> 55:12.090]  And I was like, this is there should be studies done on how this game has broken me because I
[55:12.090 --> 55:15.950]  should be outraged, but I'm I don't I don't feel anymore about it.
[55:16.290 --> 55:21.510]  But you also have the opposite of that justice of getting revenge because I wanted to be an
[55:21.510 --> 55:24.850]  alliance. I wanted to work together, but no, because they were greedy.
[55:25.110 --> 55:26.250]  We all lost everything.
[55:26.710 --> 55:33.210]  So my life hack is maybe don't attach your Twitch account to your gamer profile or else
[55:33.710 --> 55:35.790]  you might get swiped on by your enemies.
[55:36.030 --> 55:37.710]  Certainly don't do all your griefing.
[55:38.030 --> 55:38.190]  Yeah.
[55:38.350 --> 55:38.730]  Yes.
[55:39.250 --> 55:41.030]  So your life hack is don't stream.
[55:42.150 --> 55:45.470]  No, it's don't associate your Xbox gamer tag.
[55:45.750 --> 55:46.070]  Oh.
[55:46.530 --> 55:47.850]  With the thing.
[55:47.890 --> 55:50.630]  Because if he was I'd have no way of knowing that he was a Twitch streamer.
[55:50.630 --> 55:55.290]  I'm never going to just randomly assume it was because his profile literally led me to his
[55:55.290 --> 55:57.470]  Twitch account that I was able to do all this.
[55:57.550 --> 56:00.830]  That was a all time great face story, Andrew.
[56:01.150 --> 56:02.550]  Absolutely fantastic.
[56:02.790 --> 56:04.230]  So how many clips of that do you have?
[56:04.830 --> 56:07.570]  I probably have like five or six.
[56:07.670 --> 56:12.530]  That'd be so cool to like cut your cut your audio from this along with the clips like overlay.
[56:12.670 --> 56:15.090]  Oh my God, that would be so like a short or something.
[56:15.290 --> 56:18.690]  It's most of them is me laying in that thing,
[56:18.690 --> 56:21.230]  just peeking and freaking out as they run by me.
[56:21.370 --> 56:26.330]  And then the only combat I have is me being in their ship that's on fire, that's filling with
[56:26.330 --> 56:30.190]  water. I unfortunately missed the part where I threw the grenades, but yeah, I definitely have
[56:30.190 --> 56:32.850]  clips for it. So maybe the adrenaline is high, right?
[56:33.650 --> 56:37.110]  It was so high, I was so embarrassed that they're like, we got to go.
[56:37.190 --> 56:38.330]  This guy's coming after us.
[56:38.350 --> 56:40.930]  And I'm like, where the fuck am I in a storm?
[56:41.210 --> 56:42.550]  I'm just so disoriented.
[56:44.390 --> 56:45.370]  It was great.
[56:46.390 --> 56:47.550]  That is my life hack.
[56:47.550 --> 56:49.290]  Dude, that's a hell of a life hack.
[56:49.490 --> 56:50.270]  And this was a good episode.
[56:50.550 --> 56:52.070]  This is a fun episode for sure.
[56:52.670 --> 56:57.430]  I'll see if I can... maybe I'll... I don't know if anyone else has a thing they want to close on.
[56:57.590 --> 56:58.610]  I'll see if I can find a clip.
[56:58.870 --> 57:00.050]  Geoff, what episode was this?
[57:00.390 --> 57:03.890]  This was episode 205, our 204th episode.
[57:04.070 --> 57:05.070]  Also known as...
[57:05.730 --> 57:06.990]  Our pent ultimate episode.
[57:08.590 --> 57:09.550]  Wait, is it pent?
[57:09.870 --> 57:10.210]  No.
[57:10.450 --> 57:11.450]  Is it pent or pen?
[57:12.310 --> 57:13.150]  Penultimate episode.
[57:13.770 --> 57:14.210]  Okay.
[57:15.650 --> 57:16.290]  Oh, wow.
[57:17.630 --> 57:19.590]  Way to bring up a 15-year-old argument.
[57:20.930 --> 57:22.590]  Look, that's what the end of the company is all about.
[57:23.250 --> 57:23.470]  Yeah.
[57:23.670 --> 57:24.510]  Yeah, it's true.
[57:24.690 --> 57:25.190]  It's true.
[57:26.450 --> 57:27.090]  Oh, God.
[57:27.250 --> 57:29.250]  End of the company for me is taking over the store.
[57:29.630 --> 57:30.710]  You guys see those Vayner images?
[57:30.870 --> 57:31.710]  I thought that was so funny.
[57:32.370 --> 57:34.230]  Man, so all that stuff sold out pretty quick, huh?
[57:34.250 --> 57:36.970]  I didn't see... I didn't even see updates on it or anything.
[57:37.750 --> 57:38.910]  Oh, here, let me...
[57:38.910 --> 57:39.690]  Did you save the company?
[57:41.570 --> 57:41.890]  No.
[57:42.270 --> 57:42.650]  No, I didn't.
[57:43.290 --> 57:45.650]  But I did take it over.
[57:46.310 --> 57:48.430]  Here, I'm going to post a link to the store.
[57:49.650 --> 57:53.610]  The fact that this is what the RT store is going out on is ridiculous.
[57:55.430 --> 57:57.190]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[57:57.470 --> 57:58.490]  That's absolutely amazing.
[58:03.490 --> 58:04.450]  It was...
[58:04.930 --> 58:06.730]  All the credit goes to the merch team.
[58:06.790 --> 58:08.910]  That was their idea to do a takeover thing.
[58:09.350 --> 58:10.130]  And it was so funny.
[58:10.130 --> 58:16.850]  You know, let me say, as the human individual who created
[58:18.330 --> 58:23.050]  our online merch presence, built our first web store,
[58:23.890 --> 58:29.650]  managed the first four stores, was 100% in charge of all of it for the first seven years,
[58:29.810 --> 58:32.550]  I couldn't be prouder of how that store...
[58:33.890 --> 58:35.930]  And getting to see that banner.
[58:36.530 --> 58:37.410]  It made...
[58:37.410 --> 58:41.930]  Looking at that banner made me think about when I first discovered Red vs. Blue.
[58:42.830 --> 58:47.550]  And like, if I could go back to me in that moment of discovering the site for the first time,
[58:47.670 --> 58:49.910]  and just showing that image of like,
[58:50.330 --> 58:52.550]  this is going to be the last thing that the store,
[58:52.650 --> 58:55.110]  the website that you're on, that you've just become obsessed with.
[58:55.490 --> 58:59.010]  They're going to sell a line with your name taking over the store,
[58:59.130 --> 59:00.570]  and it's going to be plungers.
[59:01.010 --> 59:03.090]  Now, figure out how to get there.
[59:03.750 --> 59:04.650]  There's no way.
[59:04.650 --> 59:07.330]  It's one of those things where if you did see that,
[59:07.430 --> 59:10.970]  if you saw the end from the past, you would never be able to get there.
[59:11.350 --> 59:13.950]  Impossible. Yeah. No chance.
[59:14.730 --> 59:17.030]  You'd just be like, when do I start working on this?
[59:19.430 --> 59:21.330]  I gotta drop out of high school immediately.
[59:21.970 --> 59:25.250]  I did. I bought some thumbsticks. Yeah, I think I'm going to send some,
[59:25.310 --> 59:27.610]  but I bought some just in case you didn't get them.
[59:28.110 --> 59:28.810]  So we can...
[59:28.810 --> 59:29.370]  Oh, yeah.
[59:30.670 --> 59:33.290]  I haven't had any of the most recent stuff.
[59:33.290 --> 59:35.070]  Well, you're definitely getting thumbsticks.
[59:35.550 --> 59:36.390]  It's at the office.
[59:36.610 --> 59:37.170]  Oh, where though?
[59:37.310 --> 59:39.650]  Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff in our office.
[59:40.210 --> 59:41.550]  Yeah, our office.
[59:42.110 --> 59:42.810]  Yeah, you were just there.
[59:42.930 --> 59:43.970]  There's boxes of shit.
[59:44.130 --> 59:45.270]  Yeah, there's boxes of stuff.
[59:45.470 --> 59:46.730]  I mean, like boxes of stuff.
[59:46.930 --> 59:47.730]  Like boxes and boxes.
[59:47.910 --> 59:49.590]  Tony made a special box just for you.
[59:50.070 --> 59:50.430]  Like boxes and boxes.
[59:50.430 --> 59:53.030]  Should I just go and pillage when I go back to get my stuff?
[59:53.430 --> 59:53.770]  Yes.
[59:54.110 --> 59:54.330]  Yeah.
[59:54.450 --> 59:55.370]  All right. All right.
[59:55.450 --> 59:55.790]  Chill out.
[59:56.170 --> 59:58.450]  Is it pillaging if the company's dead?
[59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.290]  I don't think that's pillaging.
[01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:02.170]  I think you're just...
[01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.390]  I think it's just stuff.
[01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:05.490]  I don't think it belongs to anybody.
[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.430]  I guess you're pillaging from HBO or Warner, technically.
[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:13.030]  Y'all believe that the fucking Mythbusters shut down the company?
[01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:13.890]  That's crazy.
[01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.670]  Shark Week took us out.
[01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:18.830]  Thanks, Gavin.
[01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.430]  Thanks, Gavin.
[01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:25.290]  Oh, man, I hate to say it, but we should probably end this episode
[01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.390]  so that we can record the next episode.
[01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.690]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:33.070]  Yo, did you have your clip?
[01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:35.830]  I'll throw it in next one.
[01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:36.430]  I don't know.
[01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.950]  Well, we got time. We're talking about it now.
[01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:39.290]  All right, well, we'll see you next time.
[01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:40.090]  Thanks for listening.
[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.330]  One more episode.
[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.110]  Bye.
[01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.810]  Hold on. Not so fast.
[01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:46.670]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:47.910]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.490]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.190]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:52.950]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:53.850]  No!
[01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.530]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:57.610]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.310]  No!
[01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:58.890]  Oh, shit!
[01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.010]  Jeff!
[01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.290]  You got me!
[01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.950]  What the fuck?
[01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.490]  This is a disaster.
[01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.130]  I thought it was going to be the next episode.
[01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:08.610]  Motherfucker!
[01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:10.630]  You talk so much.
[01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:11.430]  I know!
[01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:12.890]  It was astonishingly...
[01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:13.390]  Oh!
[01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.830]  Just can't even hear it.
[01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:16.690]  He didn't mask.
[01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:17.830]  He was wearing the mask.
[01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.890]  I did it.
[01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.470]  He didn't sound different at all.
[01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.710]  He didn't sound different at...
[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:23.630]  He didn't really talk.
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:24.110]  All.
[01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:25.590]  Now, I will say...
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:29.710]  So, I will say, I was thinking in this episode,
[01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:32.970]  I'm like, Nick is being so vocal.
[01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:36.930]  He's making so many, like, face jam style noises.
[01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:43.010]  But, but, I thought it was just me go, like, I didn't even...
[01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:44.230]  It didn't fucking clock.
[01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:45.370]  It is like he's wearing the mask.
[01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:46.590]  Motherfucker!
[01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:47.430]  I got you!
[01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.390]  Think about it.
[01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.990]  I did.
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.210]  And I actually...
[01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.330]  The first couple times I heard him speak up, I went, oh, I'm glad I can hear Nick.
[01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:54.490]  He sounds normal.
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.910]  I don't have to worry about that bit.
[01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:58.350]  Sounds a hundred percent...
[01:01:58.850 --> 01:01:59.330]  Goddammit!
[01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.270]  I did it!
[01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:00.930]  You caught us!
[01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.010]  That's, uh, 2-0.
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:05.090]  That's... Nick takes 2024.
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:06.510]  2025, though!
[01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.150]  Oh, good luck, son.
[01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.390]  We're coming back strong.
[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:11.570]  Wow!
[01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.050]  Also, Nick, you...
[01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:15.050]  Nick, you have to give that mask back to Warner Brothers.
[01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:15.670]  Oh!
[01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.490]  Oh, I had to get this out of the way for that reason.
[01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:22.630]  All right, seriously, though, let's stop.
[01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:24.030]  Bye!
[01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.770]  Bye!
[01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:29.670]  Hey, guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:32.330]  It's the final episode before the next one.
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:34.450]  Gavin shows off his special part.
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:35.850]  Someone's going to jail.
[01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.550]  What do you put in your mouth?
[01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:39.230]  How do you iron your pants?
[01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:40.510]  What comes next?
[01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.990]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.990]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
