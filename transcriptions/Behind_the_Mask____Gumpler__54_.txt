[00:25.860 --> 00:29.420]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:29.420 --> 00:32.520]  This is number 54. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:32.660 --> 00:36.360]  And with me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, and Eric Baddour.
[00:36.800 --> 00:39.900]  Gavin, you were going to explain the behind-the-mask thing.
[00:40.560 --> 00:52.640]  Behind-the-mask, right, was obviously about Nick and the faces he makes behind the mask.
[00:56.460 --> 00:58.040]  That doesn't sound right.
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.540]  Does anybody have any memory of what behind-the-mask means and why we wrote that note down?
[01:07.260 --> 01:12.360]  Oh, were we going to do an episode where it was, we're in the CPAP machine?
[01:25.360 --> 01:25.880]  Unlistenable.
[01:33.580 --> 01:36.180]  Now I know why Andrew took a while to get ready.
[01:38.520 --> 01:44.360]  And the setup behind the mask, a show with Gavin and I. This is a little teaser.
[01:45.500 --> 01:49.060]  He sounds like Stephen Hawking at the bottom of a flight of stairs.
[01:49.280 --> 01:50.120]  Yeah, it's pretty brutal.
[01:52.880 --> 01:56.000]  And that's your preview of behind the mask.
[01:59.420 --> 02:03.280]  Gavin, is that what you sound like behind your mask?
[02:03.520 --> 02:08.660]  I don't think I sound the same. So I should drag mine in here, maybe right at the end,
[02:08.700 --> 02:09.620]  right? And we'll have a conversation.
[02:10.080 --> 02:11.460]  Yeah, if you want. Yeah, we can.
[02:12.180 --> 02:14.400]  And that was sort of the point, but...
[02:14.400 --> 02:15.760]  Yeah, yeah. I forgot the bit.
[02:18.760 --> 02:22.740]  How apropos that I threw it to you randomly in the first place.
[02:23.860 --> 02:24.700]  How are you guys doing?
[02:25.400 --> 02:26.640]  Good. How are you doing, buddy?
[02:27.040 --> 02:31.920]  I'm doing really good. Way better now that I'm mask off. Mask on and talking, not great.
[02:33.960 --> 02:35.900]  I have an update on the serial killer.
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.300]  You have an update on the serial killer?
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.300]  Yeah. Last time I talked to you guys, I told you that a raccoon jumped out at me and the
[02:42.300 --> 02:46.680]  trash can scared me to holy hell. And it was like a big, meaty motherfucker. And I thought,
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.540]  it looks like he's housing a lot of dead animals in there. But I don't know, man,
[02:51.540 --> 02:54.500]  the more I think about it, I just don't know how he catches birds, right?
[02:54.700 --> 03:01.960]  That doesn't make any sense to me. Birds are so fast. But two days ago, I went outside and I
[03:01.960 --> 03:05.600]  found the back half of a bird in my front yard. Oh, no.
[03:05.960 --> 03:11.700]  Yeah. Like the ass and the legs and the tail and the back tail. Yeah. I have no idea what
[03:11.700 --> 03:16.100]  happened to the wings and the head. I mean, I have a pretty good idea they're in something else.
[03:16.540 --> 03:20.440]  But yeah, they didn't want the butt. So they left the butt for me. I had to throw that away.
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.900]  I thought that'd be where all the good stuff is on a bird, like the wings down.
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.820]  You would think so. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what caused this animal to only eat
[03:29.820 --> 03:38.280]  half of a perfectly good bird. But yeah, it still seems to be an active crime zone. My yard.
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.700]  I think you got to put a camera there. I'm scared to see. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right.
[03:43.820 --> 03:48.600]  And unfortunately, but I'm scared to get the footage. Or forget like a security camera. We'll
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.480]  build one of those little hides with a camo all over it. And we'll just sit in there and eat lunch
[03:54.480 --> 04:02.360]  and film. We could we could do that. Yeah. I guess it's not happening at lunchtime. Are chicken wings
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.500]  all wings? As opposed to what? Well, you know, there's like when you order chicken wings,
[04:07.520 --> 04:13.860]  there's two types of wing, generally speaking. What, left and right? Yeah. Yeah. That's how I
[04:13.860 --> 04:18.360]  divide them up. That's how I split. I personally prefer the left. It's, I think, a better quality
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.960]  meat than the right. But there's like a drumstick. It's like wings and a drumstick. And obviously
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.460]  the wing meat. I know that is by the bones. What's where's the the drum part coming? Leg.
[04:29.760 --> 04:35.320]  Yeah. It's the thigh and the leg. Huh? That's not really a wing. Are you talking about like the
[04:35.320 --> 04:41.300]  flat in the wing? What do you? Yeah. So there's two types. There's the I think flat is the one
[04:41.300 --> 04:47.300]  I'm thinking that's very wing like. And then there's sort of like the bone, the drumstick kind
[04:47.300 --> 04:53.720]  of. Oh, so you're just talking about like a cut up wing. Yeah. Is that is the drumette? Oh,
[04:53.880 --> 05:01.140]  OK. So it's like that. It's like shoulder to elbow. It's so it's like a shoulder blade bone meat.
[05:02.940 --> 05:08.060]  So it's like forearm and shoulder blade is a chicken wing. This is not going to be our
[05:08.060 --> 05:11.420]  thumbnail. We need to talk about different stuff in this episode. We had gleeking around
[05:11.420 --> 05:16.480]  like in the last one that came out. I'm not going to make that up. There's still plenty of time to
[05:16.480 --> 05:21.900]  that doesn't have to be the thumbnail. It's fine. It's fine. I'm not. Yeah. Picture a raw chicken
[05:21.900 --> 05:27.960]  meat. Yeah. For the audience. What do we do with the tip? Probably use it for like stock or
[05:27.960 --> 05:35.100]  something. OK. Yeah. Feed it to a dog, you know. Oh, a dog would love the tip. I don't like I don't
[05:35.100 --> 05:39.800]  like that. Dogs love chicken bones and they're real. They're real good for dogs too. It's got
[05:39.800 --> 05:46.340]  to be laid. It's just a great meaty tip. So the bones are actually good for the dog? I think it
[05:46.340 --> 05:51.060]  helps with the teeth, right? No, no. Dogs aren't supposed to eat chicken bones. No, they can't
[05:51.060 --> 05:55.880]  before they're cooked. Yes, that's true. It's Nick is Nick is technically correct. You can eat
[05:55.880 --> 05:59.660]  them before. I don't know why I said technically correct. He's 100% correct. You can eat them.
[05:59.940 --> 06:03.900]  Yeah, you can eat them before they're cooked. But why are they worth this cooked? Because the bone
[06:03.900 --> 06:08.700]  can splinter. Yeah. The bone gets real malleable and scars. Yeah. And it can fuck a dog's mouth
[06:08.700 --> 06:13.300]  or throw it up real bad. Yeah. Oh, they can choke real bad. But don't dogs chew the big bones because
[06:13.300 --> 06:17.820]  of like their teeth? Isn't that a positive? Different bones. Yeah, I understand different
[06:17.820 --> 06:21.620]  bones, but I'm just saying that's that's the incentive of the bone chew, right? Like it
[06:21.620 --> 06:26.480]  helps their teeth. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we have a bone equivalent as a human? I want to chew on
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.700]  something. We do. You could go to a restaurant and get like get like I have we there's a place
[06:32.700 --> 06:39.560]  in Austin that has bone tallow tacos. Is it just like a giant bone I could bite into? What is bones
[06:39.560 --> 06:45.640]  for people? Let's see. Like just something I can gnaw on that helps my teeth. What do people gnaw
[06:45.640 --> 06:52.360]  on? Brushing is boring. Oh, you want a greenie for a person? I don't know what that means. Yeah,
[06:52.440 --> 06:58.800]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He wants a people. Oh, dude. He wants a human Kong. Yeah, I do. That's
[06:58.800 --> 07:04.440]  exactly what I want. It's true. Unfortunately, I have an answer on something that you can gnaw on,
[07:04.440 --> 07:13.460]  but you're not going to like it. Let's see. Oh, it's a pencil. Listen, listen. I searched
[07:13.460 --> 07:17.920]  what can people gnaw on and pencil, broken pencil, the pencil thing. This showed up. I'm
[07:17.920 --> 07:23.320]  just letting you know. We are about to annoy a lot of audience when I make that the thumbnail
[07:23.320 --> 07:30.980]  for episode 50. You're a psycho. You're crazy. Never happened. You can't stop me.
[07:31.880 --> 07:37.020]  Speaking of the pencil, Cheyenne still killing it in Survivor. He's in the final
[07:37.020 --> 07:41.080]  six. I haven't watched this week's episode, but thank you for letting me know. No problem.
[07:42.080 --> 07:48.440]  Final six. He did great. It's not my fault. You didn't watch it. I know. And I could have
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.720]  communicated that to you ahead of time, too. He's doing fantastic. We're almost at the finale.
[07:54.480 --> 07:59.820]  Two more episodes and we're there. He's killing it. Yeah, he's and he's a lot of fun to watch.
[07:59.820 --> 08:05.880]  He's a really likable, personal guy. He's so much fun to watch. I have a clip to play
[08:05.880 --> 08:13.500]  because this show filled with ridiculous coincidences. You know, just the fact that
[08:13.500 --> 08:20.540]  Cheyenne is on Survivor after being our pencil judge of all things is nuts. He recently made a
[08:20.540 --> 08:26.580]  TikTok about how to properly pronounce his name. And there's something in it that blew my mind.
[08:26.580 --> 08:28.780]  I couldn't believe this. I'm going to play this really quick.
[08:29.960 --> 08:34.420]  I've had a couple of people ask me how to say my name, and I love that people want to take the
[08:34.420 --> 08:40.720]  care to get my name right, especially because it is such a cool name. My name means Royal White
[08:40.720 --> 08:49.540]  Falcon. Could you imagine? What? Cheyenne's name means Falcon. That's fucking crazy.
[08:49.540 --> 08:52.780]  He's the most regulation human. He's a Falcon!
[08:52.980 --> 09:00.160]  The universe is trying to tell this guy to be our friend, and I bet he will not listen,
[09:00.300 --> 09:04.680]  but goddamn, man. Well, no, no. Here's the thing. So I've been talking to Cheyenne. I've been going
[09:04.680 --> 09:10.000]  back and forth. I've been messaging him. Oh, good. And I let him know about the Falcon connection.
[09:10.180 --> 09:14.260]  That blew his mind. He really wants some Falcon merch. I was showing our Protected by Falcon
[09:14.260 --> 09:21.040]  sign. He's now on the Patreon. I gifted him a subscription. He's a Protected by Falcon.
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.420]  He's in the mix. He's very excited. Oh, man, that's awesome. He's not going to change his
[09:26.420 --> 09:31.520]  ruling, though. No, I'm fine with the ruling. I've accepted the ruling. All good with the ruling,
[09:31.660 --> 09:36.840]  but just that I couldn't believe that. I have. I haven't paid the consequence of the ruling,
[09:36.880 --> 09:41.620]  but I've accepted it. I'm not fighting it. Really? It's like somebody committed a crime
[09:41.620 --> 09:46.000]  and they're like, yeah, I should go to jail, but I'm not. I'm not going yet, but I should.
[09:46.600 --> 09:50.680]  You're right. That person was also saying, hey, when's this other guy going to wear the red boots?
[09:50.780 --> 09:59.160]  Why haven't you done it yet? What do you mean? I know what Gavin's talking about. Are you saying
[09:59.160 --> 10:04.060]  I'm the only person that's demanding that? I just think for a guy who needs to eat an entire pencil,
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.000]  you're pretty heavy on the boots thing. Well, it's just because I want us to be able to release
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.100]  season two of the show. Yeah, I want you to eat the pencil. Yeah, but there's not a season of
[10:12.100 --> 10:18.960]  content behind the pencil. I'm not holding up. There's not pencil two that we need to do around
[10:18.960 --> 10:25.700]  the corner. It's just pencil one. And I would argue not eating the pencil has made way more
[10:25.700 --> 10:29.880]  content than if I would have just eaten it. Man, I want to see the movie poster for pencil two.
[10:32.520 --> 10:38.280]  Number two pencil? Yeah, but pencil two, it's the sequel. Dude, number two pencil is pretty good.
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.420]  Number two. Oh, but it wouldn't be called that. We do like the now you see me thing where we do
[10:43.420 --> 10:47.680]  now you see me two and three and then we finally do now you don't. It would take us a while to
[10:47.680 --> 10:55.160]  get there. Unfortunately, story of the pencil number two is already a movie. Oh, man. Sorry,
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.740]  guys. There's something so good looking about pencil as an item. What if we call it pencil
[10:59.740 --> 11:06.420]  two? The sharpening. Oh, what if we just call pencils? Make it like a thriller. Oh, pencils.
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.500]  That sounds like a Zach Galifianakis comedy. Like aliens? Pencils as an aliens thing is
[11:11.500 --> 11:19.100]  interesting. And the third one would be called Perthriensel. Awesome. Profenseless.
[11:20.420 --> 11:26.740]  You not believe the pencils that that fucking Android is making. It's crazy. Or which one was
[11:26.740 --> 11:31.640]  that? What was the sequel to Prometheus called? Covenant? Covenant. Alien Covenant. Yeah.
[11:32.460 --> 11:37.320]  Doesn't matter. Are there any other alien movies coming out? There's a TV show. Yeah,
[11:37.340 --> 11:43.920]  I know. But aside from that. No, it's the year Predator. Alien Remus. They got like two different
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.480]  Predator movies coming out this year. It is the year of Predator. Yeah. Interesting. And they're
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.440]  doing like the Terminator two thing with it, I think, where it's like a Predator hunting other
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.420]  Predators for some reason. Oh, like he's on the he's a good guy Predator? I don't know if he's a
[11:57.420 --> 12:02.340]  good guy, but like he's working with an Android to take out a worse Predator for some reason.
[12:02.620 --> 12:09.000]  I don't know. A worse Predator. Oh, this Predator is so bad. Because I mean, the Predators aren't
[12:09.740 --> 12:15.180]  they're not terrible, generally speaking, like there's a code of conduct that they operate by.
[12:15.500 --> 12:20.780]  They're just not like aimlessly murdering people. Right. He's a Predator who has all the same
[12:20.780 --> 12:24.420]  gifts and abilities as the other Predators, but he was came from a broken home.
[12:25.900 --> 12:31.000]  He grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. It's a Dexter situation. It's he hunts the
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.780]  Predators that are no good. Is there a link between Predators and humans in the movies?
[12:36.260 --> 12:41.240]  Not established, I don't think. No. This is just like a completely human body with a weird face.
[12:41.260 --> 12:49.360]  Is it an alien? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. You think Predator has a wiener? Because in Covenant, David
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.040]  makes like a xenomorph, essentially. I don't think we know where they came from, though.
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.100]  I don't know if they were man-made. I don't think that's been established.
[12:58.460 --> 13:05.320]  Is David Michael Fassbender? Yes. Okay, let's make it strange. Michael Fassbender,
[13:05.620 --> 13:11.740]  the star of Assassin's Creed, everybody's favorite Fassbender movie. I just saw him in a movie the
[13:11.740 --> 13:15.280]  other night. You know, I watched those Equalizer movies and I thought, fuck, maybe I'll watch
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.400]  another movie. And so the other night in bed, I watched Black Bag. Pretty good. Dude, I loved
[13:20.400 --> 13:28.340]  that movie. It is like 90 minutes hard and it's so fun. I love that. I loved it. I recommend that
[13:28.340 --> 13:33.460]  to everyone. What a great movie. Very intense, very gripping. Speaking of hard, I got a new
[13:33.460 --> 13:39.820]  worst Tom Cruise movie. Bumped Legend. Losing it. Terrible. Such a bad movie. Have you seen
[13:39.820 --> 13:45.860]  it? When I was like eight, maybe. Horrible. Holy shit. When did that movie come out?
[13:46.100 --> 13:54.400]  Like 83, maybe. I don't. Yeah, I was a 19, 1982. Yeah, I didn't even realize he was in it.
[13:54.720 --> 13:59.860]  That was a titty movie when I was growing up. It sure is. It's about a group of high school
[13:59.860 --> 14:05.860]  kids going to Tijuana to lose their virginity by going to a whorehouse. Oh, wow. And they bring
[14:05.860 --> 14:09.540]  one of the character's little brothers to buy fireworks because he like sells them at the
[14:09.540 --> 14:17.900]  school. It has Rorschach in it. Jackie Earl Haley. Wow. Really? He's like maybe the comedic lead in
[14:17.900 --> 14:25.020]  it. It's just, oh, it's bad. Shelley Long is in it too, right? She is. Yeah, she is. She's in a
[14:25.020 --> 14:29.360]  relationship with Tom Cruise in the movie. It's very bad. Oh my God. It's not good. I want to see
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.300]  a version of Watchmen where Rorschach is the comic relief. Yeah, it is really funny in the movie
[14:34.300 --> 14:38.520]  where they separate off the Tom Cruise and Shelley Long characters. And it feels like, oh yeah,
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.180]  these are the best actors in this. Let's just let's have them have their chunk in the movie.
[14:43.420 --> 14:49.820]  It is by far all of their solo scenes are the best parts of the film. It's terrible. There's one.
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.460]  There's only one good gag in it. I really enjoy when watching a horrible movie, finding like the
[14:54.460 --> 15:00.140]  one thing that is like, oh, that was good. They have to flee Tijuana and there's a cop chasing
[15:00.140 --> 15:05.380]  them at the end. And the kid that buys all the fireworks lights them and throws the bag in the
[15:05.380 --> 15:09.920]  car. And so the sheriff is delayed and like chasing them because he's got to wait for the fireworks to
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.660]  go off. But then he decides to just go anyway. And so it's a car chase. And every once in a while,
[15:14.680 --> 15:20.540]  his car just flashes because there's still things going off in it. It's the one funny gag in the
[15:20.540 --> 15:26.360]  whole movie. And they don't do it long enough, but they do like he drives and everything seems fine.
[15:26.360 --> 15:28.920]  He turns the corner and starts flashing again. And it's great.
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.060]  That's funny. It is very funny. But outside of that, terrible. Such a bad movie.
[15:35.620 --> 15:38.920]  Yeah, I don't think I've seen that movie since puberty. Probably.
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.740]  I think you saw it at the perfect time to see it at the perfect year to see it.
[15:44.180 --> 15:49.180]  Not worth revisiting. But it is on YouTube. So it's I mean, you saw it again after you ate.
[15:49.660 --> 15:51.920]  No, I don't think I've seen it since I turned since I hit puberty.
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.880]  At eight? I hit puberty at 13. I'm saying I don't I don't think I've seen it.
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.280]  Okay, right. So but you've seen it after that, right?
[16:01.760 --> 16:05.720]  Gavin has his notebook out like he's in L.A. Noire. And he's like, wait a second.
[16:06.280 --> 16:08.420]  Next to doubt. Doubt. I'm doubting you.
[16:09.080 --> 16:11.860]  No, for some reason, I just couldn't comprehend you watching it after it came out.
[16:14.960 --> 16:20.040]  I didn't see it at the theater. I think I probably saw it on a VHS tape at a friend's
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.440]  house. I was somewhere around seven, eight or nine. And I didn't see it again.
[16:25.520 --> 16:29.040]  And then you watch it again when you were like 13. And then you watch it again recently.
[16:29.220 --> 16:31.380]  At what time did you watch on YouTube like me, Jeff?
[16:31.720 --> 16:34.380]  That movie. The reason I brought up puberty is just like a
[16:34.860 --> 16:40.560]  milestone in a kid's life that you can mark things by. But also, I think I probably would
[16:40.560 --> 16:44.960]  have appreciated the movie more post-puberty because I would have been a horny little Jeff,
[16:45.020 --> 16:48.620]  you know, but I saw it when I was a kid when boobs meant nothing to me. So yeah.
[16:48.620 --> 16:52.060]  Why don't you do your first pubic viewing of Losers?
[16:54.060 --> 16:54.580]  Dude, what?
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.500]  Dude, actually for So Alright a while back, I was gonna watch the... I tried to watch the
[17:00.500 --> 17:03.820]  ski movie Hot Dog. You know that one?
[17:04.380 --> 17:05.640]  Hell yeah. I think you've mentioned it before.
[17:06.220 --> 17:12.520]  I made it about 14 minutes in and I had to turn it off because I was offended by all of the
[17:12.520 --> 17:17.440]  comical sexual assault. And I was just like, this is... everybody's going to jail. I cannot
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.240]  watch this. I'm going to go to hell for watching this. And this was like a PG movie when I was a
[17:21.240 --> 17:24.700]  kid. It's fucking crazy. Not literally PG movie, but you know what I mean? It was like a movie that
[17:24.700 --> 17:28.360]  every kid saw when I was a kid growing up. It's just like it's so stark how much the world has
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.960]  changed in my lifetime. It's like I don't think I should watch. I don't think I should watch Losing
[17:32.960 --> 17:39.540]  It either. No, no, you shouldn't. There's a large subplot about the main supposed to be likable
[17:39.540 --> 17:44.700]  character wanting to buy roofies in Mexico and being very excited about it. Oh, I remember that.
[17:44.700 --> 17:49.260]  Yeah. Or was it Busted Loose where they were trying to buy Spanish Fly? No, no, no. It was
[17:49.260 --> 17:56.300]  Losing It. It's Spanish Fly. That's what they call it. Yeah. It's not great. It sounds bad.
[17:56.440 --> 18:04.420]  If we can get away from this whole topic, can I shift gears a little bit and show that a regulation
[18:04.420 --> 18:13.620]  listener is introducing Lil Jeffy. Lil Jeffy is great. On the subreddit, this is Lil Jeffy.
[18:15.080 --> 18:20.860]  Oh, that's so cute. It's a cat. Oh, if you're listening, there's a cat. It's a picture of a
[18:20.860 --> 18:26.840]  cat. It's a small cat. They said they wanted to honor me. I feel exceptionally honored. Thank you
[18:26.840 --> 18:32.820]  so much. Yep. Bailey is great. You are great. And what a cute little cat Lil Jeffy is. Cute
[18:32.820 --> 18:39.020]  little cat Lil Jeffy the cat. There you go. I think we've all been there. Booking a doctor

[20:44.260 --> 20:46.520]  That was a great palate cleanse, Eric. Thank you.
[20:47.180 --> 20:50.680]  Yeah, yeah, just had to keep an eye on it. Yeah, there you go.
[20:50.960 --> 20:52.540]  Can I pivot to another palate cleanse?
[20:52.740 --> 20:53.540]  Yeah, please.
[20:53.900 --> 20:56.880]  I went to Home Depot on Saturday to buy some stuff for the house.
[20:57.740 --> 20:59.880]  And, uh, my house, not the fucking office house.
[21:00.360 --> 21:05.200]  And, uh, I, uh, while I was there, I realized I had to take a bad piss.
[21:05.460 --> 21:06.700]  Like, I gotta go.
[21:07.860 --> 21:13.720]  Being an old dude is kind of like being six again,
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.960]  where you go from like zero to I'm gonna piss my pants in like eight seconds.
[21:18.020 --> 21:19.140]  You're like, I think I have to pee.
[21:19.240 --> 21:21.000]  And then you go, I think I'm going to pee right now.
[21:21.340 --> 21:22.160]  You're like, how did that happen?
[21:22.160 --> 21:23.740]  But it's like, it's also inconsistent.
[21:24.040 --> 21:25.120]  Like sometimes that doesn't happen.
[21:25.180 --> 21:26.640]  And then just like one day, it's like, no, no.
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.740]  Today's the day you're going to piss your pants.
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.260]  And so I ran.
[21:30.360 --> 21:31.260]  I was like talking to Emily.
[21:31.360 --> 21:32.340]  She was looking at plants or something.
[21:32.400 --> 21:34.540]  I was like, I'm gonna go run, find the bathroom, take a piss real fast.
[21:35.040 --> 21:37.800]  Of course, it was all the way on the other side of Home Depot.
[21:38.060 --> 21:41.160]  So I was doing like the piss walk and trying not to hold my dick as I walked.
[21:41.260 --> 21:42.080]  I was really trying to keep it in.
[21:42.560 --> 21:45.000]  And then I've never experienced this before,
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.980]  but it's on the far wall where like the lumber and like sheetrock and stuff is.
[21:51.420 --> 21:55.120]  And I was about an aisle out from the bathroom.
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.940]  I can see the break in the wall.
[21:57.200 --> 21:58.300]  It's just like, it's not a door or anything.
[21:58.400 --> 21:59.320]  It's just like a hallway.
[21:59.480 --> 22:00.240]  You go in and take a left.
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.680]  And more than an aisle out, I started to smell human waste.
[22:05.980 --> 22:09.440]  And I thought, oh, am I smelling that?
[22:09.520 --> 22:12.080]  And I'm like, wow, they need to clean the bathroom or something.
[22:12.200 --> 22:14.320]  That's, they must be having plumbing problems, right?
[22:14.320 --> 22:21.120]  And it became so intense that I felt as almost as if I was pushing against the poop smelling air.
[22:21.340 --> 22:23.720]  As I got closer and closer, it was so dense.
[22:24.160 --> 22:27.460]  And I was like, I got to a point where I thought if I didn't have to pee this terribly,
[22:27.540 --> 22:28.720]  I would not walk into this bathroom.
[22:28.960 --> 22:30.460]  Like, I don't know what's wrong with this.
[22:30.520 --> 22:33.480]  I expect to walk in and there to be a sign that says like,
[22:33.560 --> 22:36.480]  do not use and just like puddles of shit everywhere,
[22:36.620 --> 22:39.040]  bubbling up out of spigots in the ground or something, you know?
[22:39.720 --> 22:41.200]  But I'm going to pee my pants otherwise.
[22:41.200 --> 22:46.000]  So I go in and as I'm going in, I hear somebody take one of my shits.
[22:46.240 --> 22:47.700]  You know what my shits sound like, right?
[22:47.920 --> 22:50.300]  They're like an explosion and it's painful.
[22:50.660 --> 22:52.880]  And it's like, and it sounds like somebody's painting a wall.
[22:53.700 --> 22:55.220]  And I go, whoa.
[22:55.380 --> 22:59.360]  And I look and the first stall over there is just me and then a stall that's shut.
[22:59.920 --> 23:02.060]  And as soon as the guy takes his dump, he goes,
[23:03.480 --> 23:07.700]  and I thought, that's the grossest thing I've heard somebody do after a loud shit.
[23:08.120 --> 23:09.920]  And so I run over and I'm trying to pee real fast
[23:09.920 --> 23:11.860]  and then trying to wash my hands to get out of there.
[23:12.040 --> 23:14.180]  And in the like, however long that took, not terribly long,
[23:14.700 --> 23:19.200]  that guy, he shit another four times to five total while I was in there.
[23:19.320 --> 23:22.480]  And every time after he exploded, he would go,
[23:25.020 --> 23:27.640]  and then as I was washing my hands, he flushed the toilet.
[23:27.680 --> 23:29.900]  And I thought, I cannot see the human being that made this.
[23:29.940 --> 23:31.140]  So I ran out of the bathroom.
[23:31.240 --> 23:34.600]  I did not want to make eye contact with that whatever human that is.
[23:34.920 --> 23:38.160]  No, I just didn't want to know because there was something so unsettling
[23:38.160 --> 23:43.240]  about how satisfied he was verbally with each time he exploded.
[23:43.860 --> 23:46.720]  Like, it's almost as if he was like, good one, nailed it.
[23:46.960 --> 23:47.000]  Yeah.
[23:47.100 --> 23:48.560]  Missed your chance to meet the equalizer.
[23:49.480 --> 23:50.200]  Exactly right.
[23:50.300 --> 23:54.360]  And when I do it, I go, oh, dear God, I'm so sorry I'm alive, you know?
[23:54.420 --> 23:56.400]  And I'm like, I hope no other human being on earth heard this,
[23:56.440 --> 23:57.660]  unless I'm recording it for y'all, of course.
[23:58.740 --> 24:02.240]  And there was just something about the confidence and pleasure with which he was
[24:02.940 --> 24:05.960]  that just made me think he's probably a stone cold killer.
[24:06.100 --> 24:07.420]  And so I didn't want to be around him.
[24:08.560 --> 24:10.460]  Maybe it's something you get in later life.
[24:11.060 --> 24:11.580]  I don't know.
[24:11.820 --> 24:13.920]  He definitely sounded older than I did.
[24:14.300 --> 24:15.880]  Than I than I am, you know?
[24:15.920 --> 24:18.020]  Yeah, I envisioned him older for some reason.
[24:18.300 --> 24:21.660]  I assume he's like an older dude with gray hair, you know?
[24:23.140 --> 24:26.620]  Because it wouldn't be someone who's like 21 and then do it.
[24:27.660 --> 24:30.180]  And that is that's my one thing for this podcast.
[24:30.240 --> 24:31.220]  That's all I had this week.
[24:31.320 --> 24:32.960]  So, oh, I'm done.
[24:33.660 --> 24:34.240]  Oh, man.
[24:34.920 --> 24:37.000]  That was a nice palate cleanse away from the cats.
[24:37.000 --> 24:37.940]  Yeah, thanks.
[24:38.620 --> 24:40.640]  Would you ever Dave England style it if you had to?
[24:41.140 --> 24:41.960]  Like in a public bathroom?
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.460]  No, no, the you know, when he took a shit or whatever in the toilet,
[24:46.540 --> 24:48.400]  that's just because Home Depot filled with toilets.
[24:48.780 --> 24:50.140]  Oh, you mean the display toilet?
[24:50.260 --> 24:51.060]  Yeah, the display.
[24:51.360 --> 24:52.260]  You really had to pee.
[24:53.240 --> 24:56.120]  If I really had to pee, would I piss in a display toilet?
[24:56.360 --> 24:57.600]  Yeah, I would use the display toilet.
[24:57.720 --> 25:00.320]  It's surely better just to piss on the floor at that point.
[25:00.440 --> 25:00.960]  You think so?
[25:01.180 --> 25:02.720]  You got to find a trash can.
[25:02.760 --> 25:03.500]  You got to piss in it.
[25:03.500 --> 25:05.100]  You got to piss in a trash can, right?
[25:05.180 --> 25:06.620]  I didn't even consider that.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.280]  If it was that bad, I would have run outside and just pissed against the wall.
[25:11.920 --> 25:12.320]  Probably.
[25:12.320 --> 25:12.920]  That's interesting.
[25:13.240 --> 25:14.320]  Like into like the gardens?
[25:14.520 --> 25:15.500]  Like in the garden section?
[25:15.540 --> 25:17.480]  Yeah, like in the back of the garden section.
[25:18.160 --> 25:18.760]  Piss on the porch.
[25:18.760 --> 25:19.820]  You're already there with Emily.
[25:19.920 --> 25:20.380]  It's perfect.
[25:20.520 --> 25:21.640]  You don't need to go anywhere.
[25:22.540 --> 25:23.700]  All these bags of...
[25:23.700 --> 25:24.820]  I just screamed like, don't look at me.
[25:24.900 --> 25:25.620]  I'm so sorry.
[25:25.820 --> 25:27.900]  All this sod smells like piss.
[25:28.740 --> 25:30.100]  We're going to buy it anyway.
[25:30.700 --> 25:34.380]  If you pissed in the display toilet, wouldn't it just leak out the back of the toilet?
[25:35.340 --> 25:36.980]  I guess it would, wouldn't it?
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.700]  Where did you think it went?
[25:38.900 --> 25:40.920]  I just kind of imagined it holding it.
[25:41.380 --> 25:45.380]  You would basically just be covering an unpurchased toilet in piss,
[25:45.580 --> 25:49.760]  now requiring you to buy the toilet, probably.
[25:50.340 --> 25:51.080]  Holding it?
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.060]  And it doesn't hold it.
[25:52.240 --> 25:54.220]  Yeah, you know, like how the water just holds?
[25:54.800 --> 25:56.400]  Isn't it held by the water in the pipe?
[25:56.520 --> 25:58.480]  It is. Yeah, exactly.
[25:58.780 --> 26:01.060]  But I'm just saying in my imagination, that's what would happen.
[26:01.140 --> 26:03.380]  I would be... I haven't thought about it.
[26:03.400 --> 26:03.880]  Just fill up the toilet with piss.
[26:03.880 --> 26:07.380]  Like the pee trap you guys have installed on all these display toilets,
[26:07.540 --> 26:08.580]  it's going to help here or what?
[26:08.660 --> 26:12.320]  How often do you guys empty the piss traps on these toilets?
[26:13.860 --> 26:14.500]  Uncork it.
[26:17.280 --> 26:18.560]  I just, yeah, I'd be shocked.
[26:19.300 --> 26:22.280]  I'd never thought about it, but if I had to panic pee in a display toilet,
[26:22.420 --> 26:24.420]  I would have assumed that it would have helped.
[26:24.960 --> 26:28.160]  Let's go around and say where we would panic pee in,
[26:29.100 --> 26:30.620]  let's say a Home Depot.
[26:30.820 --> 26:31.320]  That's fine.
[26:32.120 --> 26:33.080]  Let's start with Nick.
[26:33.080 --> 26:34.740]  Nick, where would you panic pee in the Home Depot?
[26:37.660 --> 26:38.320]  I've got mine.
[26:38.620 --> 26:41.220]  If the bathroom is no option, I'm going outside.
[26:41.840 --> 26:42.120]  Okay.
[26:42.440 --> 26:43.240]  And I'm going...
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.180]  The hotdog guy is there.
[26:46.620 --> 26:49.320]  I'm going out to the garden section.
[26:49.340 --> 26:49.780]  Yeah. Okay.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.280]  I'm going behind the mulch.
[26:52.740 --> 26:53.060]  Okay.
[26:53.320 --> 26:54.220]  Okay, okay.
[26:54.480 --> 26:55.560]  Behind the mulch.
[26:55.660 --> 26:56.580]  So he took my answer.
[26:56.960 --> 26:57.880]  Yeah, he did. He stole it.
[26:57.900 --> 26:59.480]  He heard what you said and he said, I'll just...
[26:59.480 --> 26:59.860]  Gotta satisfy.
[27:00.220 --> 27:01.760]  Nick, it's okay. It's not a draft.
[27:01.760 --> 27:05.220]  Yeah, which really puts you at a disadvantage, Jeff.
[27:05.320 --> 27:06.720]  So where would you pee?
[27:07.760 --> 27:09.520]  And it can't be the same place.
[27:10.120 --> 27:10.760]  Oh, man.
[27:11.540 --> 27:12.660]  I'm gonna piss.
[27:12.780 --> 27:18.540]  I'm gonna go into the garden section and I'm gonna piss on the perennials.
[27:19.940 --> 27:20.440]  Okay.
[27:22.040 --> 27:24.140]  Gavin, where would you piss?
[27:24.140 --> 27:27.400]  I'd probably just start like peeking around little staff-only areas,
[27:27.460 --> 27:30.320]  little doors, and I'd just piss in the mop bucket or something.
[27:30.960 --> 27:31.340]  Oh.
[27:32.140 --> 27:35.500]  I'd take the mop out, have a piss in that, then I'd rinse it out,
[27:36.100 --> 27:38.360]  get it nice and clean, and then put it back.
[27:38.540 --> 27:41.680]  You're at the Home Depot cleaning out the employee mop bucket?
[27:42.180 --> 27:42.360]  Yeah.
[27:42.560 --> 27:44.020]  Don't worry about this.
[27:46.420 --> 27:47.760]  Oh, I got a great one.
[27:48.160 --> 27:48.420]  Oh, yeah.
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.080]  Can I change my answer?
[27:49.420 --> 27:49.700]  Sure.
[27:49.780 --> 27:50.200]  Of course.
[27:50.380 --> 27:53.740]  I would piss in one of the orange five-gallon buckets that you got.
[27:53.820 --> 27:53.980]  Yeah.
[27:54.360 --> 27:54.740]  Yes.
[27:55.000 --> 27:55.380]  Yeah.
[27:55.900 --> 27:56.280]  Yeah.
[27:56.740 --> 27:58.900]  That's exactly what I was gonna say,
[27:58.900 --> 28:05.740]  but I'll change my answer to the overhead, the ceiling fan and light section and just sort of...
[28:06.500 --> 28:07.700]  Yeah, there's never anybody in there.
[28:07.840 --> 28:09.120]  Nuh-uh. No, it's empty.
[28:09.340 --> 28:12.980]  There's no one looking at ceiling fans and overhead lights in the Home Depot.
[28:13.500 --> 28:18.240]  I know that it's like the most lit area, but no one's gonna come over and help you.
[28:18.580 --> 28:21.660]  No one's over there anyway, so I feel like you can get away with it over there.
[28:21.980 --> 28:27.160]  I would consider near the paint mixer to cover the noise.
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.580]  That's because it's pretty good.
[28:30.260 --> 28:31.680]  Nobody can hear you pee.
[28:31.980 --> 28:33.440]  That's a manned paint mixer.
[28:33.740 --> 28:36.620]  Yeah, the problem with the paint mixer is that an employee works it,
[28:36.680 --> 28:40.200]  and it's in the middle front of every Home Depot I've ever been to.
[28:40.300 --> 28:41.980]  Do you think you could pull off?
[28:42.040 --> 28:44.600]  Because it's like a there's like a they're surrounded, right?
[28:44.780 --> 28:47.940]  They're boxed in by the like a big like horseshoe shaped.
[28:48.200 --> 28:49.140]  Yeah, table desk.
[28:49.240 --> 28:49.580]  Yeah.
[28:49.700 --> 28:52.160]  Yeah, desk. And it's a little higher than a normal one.
[28:52.420 --> 28:56.620]  Do you think while they're like you could go give somebody a couple of cans of paint
[28:56.620 --> 29:01.940]  to shake up for you and then stand there and just be having a conversation with them
[29:01.940 --> 29:04.820]  and pissing below the level of the table?
[29:04.940 --> 29:05.980]  And they would never know.
[29:07.140 --> 29:11.400]  This is where it turns into an 80s comedy and you piss into an empty can,
[29:11.500 --> 29:13.900]  and then that gets mixed in with the ones that need mixing.
[29:14.480 --> 29:20.160]  Yeah, and then it goes to your principal's house and he paints his walls with your piss paint.
[29:20.320 --> 29:22.980]  Yeah, somebody get Tom Cruise on the phone.
[29:23.880 --> 29:25.900]  Maybe that's what happened in our little gaming room.
[29:26.940 --> 29:28.800]  Oh, oh, you think so?
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.220]  That's why it smells like piss.
[29:30.760 --> 29:34.000]  Yeah, we should film losing it to found it.
[29:36.780 --> 29:38.820]  Uh, yeah, Gavin.
[29:39.100 --> 29:41.520]  Gavin brought over a cat piss smell to our new house.
[29:41.980 --> 29:43.440]  Yeah, I mean, it was there before I got there.
[29:44.020 --> 29:44.720]  If you say so.
[29:44.820 --> 29:47.080]  Yeah, I don't know about that. I mean, I haven't smelt it, but.
[29:47.700 --> 29:51.600]  It's weird how it has its strong days and it's not strong days.
[29:52.220 --> 29:54.320]  Are the strong days the day that Gavin's there
[29:54.320 --> 29:56.480]  and the not strong days the days when Gavin's not there?
[29:56.620 --> 29:59.040]  You know, I hadn't connected those dots.
[29:59.500 --> 30:01.260]  I think it's when you blast the AC.
[30:01.760 --> 30:02.300]  It goes away.
[30:02.740 --> 30:03.500]  I think it comes.
[30:04.260 --> 30:07.480]  I feel like it's when it's hot and still in there.
[30:07.760 --> 30:10.660]  That's when it really starts to permeate.
[30:11.320 --> 30:13.520]  Also, can we stop pissing in that room, please?
[30:14.020 --> 30:15.660]  There's a bathroom right next door.
[30:15.700 --> 30:17.160]  I got it. I got to say no deal.
[30:17.760 --> 30:19.740]  It's not my fault they put the paint mixer in there.
[30:24.940 --> 30:26.460]  Do you think you could piss
[30:26.460 --> 30:29.700]  while having a conversation with someone without them knowing you're pissing?
[30:29.940 --> 30:32.420]  Oh, no, no. The second part, probably not.
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.260]  I mean, half the time I'm texting you, I'm shitting.
[30:35.840 --> 30:37.020]  Yeah, but I'm not looking at your face.
[30:37.440 --> 30:37.880]  That's true.
[30:38.080 --> 30:39.160]  And you're not trying to hide it.
[30:39.440 --> 30:41.400]  I think I could. I think I could. Yeah.
[30:42.180 --> 30:43.760]  Might be an interesting challenge.
[30:44.040 --> 30:45.380]  Just in the middle of our conversation,
[30:45.400 --> 30:47.360]  suddenly you hear the toilet flush and you're like, wait a minute.
[30:47.920 --> 30:49.800]  I never broke eye contact with you.
[30:50.020 --> 30:52.280]  Well, I just think maybe we should stand at a hidden table
[30:52.280 --> 30:53.980]  and have five conversations with someone.
[30:54.160 --> 30:55.900]  But one of the times they were pissing.
[30:56.120 --> 30:58.220]  Oh, eye contact piss roulette.
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.960]  Yeah, I like that.
[31:00.160 --> 31:01.680]  And see if they can hold it together enough
[31:01.680 --> 31:05.900]  to keep it on the down-low while they're pissing.
[31:05.940 --> 31:08.680]  How about you can't leave the table until you piss.
[31:08.860 --> 31:10.980]  And if you get caught pissing, you lose.
[31:11.400 --> 31:14.440]  But everyone only has one chance to say you're pissing.
[31:14.440 --> 31:15.700]  There's like a piss buzzer.
[31:15.700 --> 31:16.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:16.960 --> 31:18.740]  It's like, yeah, it's like a one time uno.
[31:19.840 --> 31:21.720]  This this is fetish content.
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.140]  Is that? Yeah, it is.
[31:23.300 --> 31:24.320]  Yeah. Is this?
[31:24.640 --> 31:26.940]  Yeah, this is fetish content is what it feels like.
[31:27.020 --> 31:28.400]  OK, let's not make it fetish content.
[31:28.700 --> 31:31.080]  Everyone's playing Mile High Club at the same time.
[31:31.540 --> 31:32.600]  Yeah, I just think.
[31:35.380 --> 31:36.620]  Well, hold on.
[31:36.660 --> 31:38.140]  Is there money in fetish content?
[31:38.780 --> 31:40.700]  I think there's a lot of money in it, probably.
[31:40.800 --> 31:41.920]  Yeah, I'd assume.
[31:42.420 --> 31:44.560]  Have I talked about my gumbler idea?
[31:45.100 --> 31:45.580]  Gumbler?
[31:46.980 --> 31:48.060]  What's a gumbler?
[31:49.140 --> 31:50.100]  Oh, interesting.
[31:50.280 --> 31:51.480]  Yeah, what do you think the gumbler is?
[31:52.700 --> 31:53.180]  Gumbler.
[31:53.480 --> 31:56.020]  So it's probably gurpler adjacent.
[31:57.320 --> 31:59.920]  It's got to be gurpler and Forrest Gump related, doesn't it?
[32:00.540 --> 32:02.500]  It's just Tom Hanks' gumbler.
[32:04.020 --> 32:05.620]  Maybe it's like a shrimp thing.
[32:05.780 --> 32:07.020]  Maybe it's like coat shrimp.
[32:07.440 --> 32:08.380]  Oh, oh, oh.
[32:08.560 --> 32:10.600]  Like it's a de-sheller maybe?
[32:10.600 --> 32:11.100]  What is it, shrimp?
[32:11.240 --> 32:11.680]  No, no.
[32:11.740 --> 32:12.900]  It's like a shrimp cocktail.
[32:12.900 --> 32:15.420]  It's just like the ultimate shrimp cocktail holder.
[32:16.440 --> 32:17.300]  Why would that be called a gumbler?
[32:17.780 --> 32:19.380]  Because of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company.
[32:19.940 --> 32:21.780]  Oh, still in the Forrest Gump thing.
[32:22.540 --> 32:22.860]  Yeah.
[32:23.320 --> 32:23.760]  Yeah.
[32:24.500 --> 32:24.940]  Yes.
[32:26.100 --> 32:26.540]  Gump.
[32:26.720 --> 32:28.820]  Are there any other gumps than Forrest Gump?
[32:29.340 --> 32:30.520]  I can't think of any.
[32:30.920 --> 32:32.980]  Is it a piece of gum the size of a gurpler?
[32:33.540 --> 32:33.940]  No.
[32:34.640 --> 32:35.300]  Do you want me to tell you?
[32:35.720 --> 32:35.880]  No.
[32:35.980 --> 32:36.420]  Obviously.
[32:36.660 --> 32:37.000]  No, no.
[32:37.220 --> 32:37.520]  Not yet.
[32:37.620 --> 32:38.120]  No, not yet.
[32:38.240 --> 32:38.780]  Okay, keep going.
[32:39.020 --> 32:40.580]  We gotta have... Nick hasn't had a guess yet.
[32:42.140 --> 32:42.580]  Gumpler.
[32:43.480 --> 32:44.520]  Gump shit.
[32:44.680 --> 32:44.960]  No.
[32:45.460 --> 32:49.720]  The problem is the lur really doesn't mean anything for the gurpler, so it's hard to...
[32:50.260 --> 32:51.640]  The plur really doesn't.
[32:51.680 --> 32:52.040]  Yeah.
[32:53.540 --> 32:56.680]  Yeah, the P-L-E-R is the confusing bit.
[32:57.640 --> 32:58.140]  Yeah.
[32:59.520 --> 33:00.080]  Gum.
[33:00.700 --> 33:01.580]  I've got no idea.
[33:02.740 --> 33:03.860]  Is it a mouth guard?
[33:04.320 --> 33:04.760]  Oh.
[33:05.060 --> 33:05.420]  Oh!
[33:06.260 --> 33:07.240]  That's really good.
[33:07.320 --> 33:12.580]  It's a mouth guard so you don't grind your teeth when you're sleeping or participating
[33:12.580 --> 33:13.560]  in something else.
[33:13.820 --> 33:15.940]  I'll give you a hint. It's a type of gurpler.
[33:16.360 --> 33:20.760]  Okay, is it one that it's hidden out of view from everyone when you go on Australian TV?
[33:21.140 --> 33:22.740]  Wasn't in that view and there are three of them, so...
[33:26.100 --> 33:29.080]  I mean, I couldn't really see them, but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.
[33:29.220 --> 33:31.500]  I don't think there were enough pixels in that video to show them off.
[33:32.780 --> 33:38.680]  Is it like a shot glass? Like it's bigger than a baby gurp, but smaller than a gurpler?
[33:39.300 --> 33:39.660]  No.
[33:39.660 --> 33:43.860]  I feel like a gumpler has to be bigger than a gurpler, right? Because we've talked about baby
[33:43.860 --> 33:49.360]  gurp, little gurp, gurple junior, and then the big one, which was going to be gurple X, right?
[33:49.540 --> 33:53.160]  The one that Jack had to wear on his back.
[33:53.340 --> 33:53.780]  Gurple Pro Max.
[33:54.200 --> 33:54.900]  Gurple Pro Max.
[33:55.200 --> 33:57.060]  What is the gumpler, Gavin?
[33:57.620 --> 34:03.480]  It is, in my head, a gummy gurpler. You know those five pound gummy bears, right? It would be that
[34:03.480 --> 34:06.640]  melted down and reformed into a cup.
[34:08.620 --> 34:09.060]  Gumpler.
[34:09.060 --> 34:14.900]  And I think we should make one. I think we should take green gummy bears and purple gummy bears
[34:17.040 --> 34:18.700]  and reset them as a gurpler.
[34:19.220 --> 34:22.340]  I think this is a fucking awesome idea and I...
[34:22.340 --> 34:24.000]  So we have to make one then, yeah?
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.440]  I think so. And I also want to see if it will hold liquid like a real gurpler.
[34:28.560 --> 34:29.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:29.680 --> 34:30.420]  Because I assume it would.
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.680]  We can probably double boil some gummies. I assume that would melt.
[34:34.680 --> 34:39.260]  Yeah, I gotta look at green gummy bears and just see if I can buy them by...
[34:39.260 --> 34:40.600]  Some sort of a cup form?
[34:41.320 --> 34:47.020]  Yeah, well, couldn't you just pour it inside the gurpler and have it...
[34:47.020 --> 34:49.520]  You just have to swish it around a lot? I don't know what you could do.
[34:49.520 --> 34:53.300]  Yeah, but how would it set? You'd just make a little puck at the bottom of a gurpler.
[34:53.380 --> 34:57.200]  No, you gotta move the cup around a lot so it's hanging to the outside.
[34:59.580 --> 35:04.500]  And then you pour green all on the inside and purple all on the outside.
[35:04.880 --> 35:06.480]  And then you cut the bottom.
[35:06.780 --> 35:08.700]  How do you pour on the outside of a cup?
[35:09.080 --> 35:12.880]  You theoretically could pour it...
[35:13.520 --> 35:17.520]  Like, have the gurpler be upside down, pour it on top of the upside down gurpler,
[35:17.680 --> 35:20.900]  and then you would have a shell of the gurpler.
[35:20.940 --> 35:21.920]  Right, right.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.480]  But it's liquid when you pour it.
[35:23.960 --> 35:25.740]  Yeah, but it will harden because it's sugar.
[35:27.200 --> 35:28.780]  How did Jeff do this after puberty?
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.460]  What if we... cup mold? I don't know what I'm...
[35:34.460 --> 35:38.000]  Oh, there are. It looks like we can get a silicone cup mold.
[35:38.280 --> 35:38.960]  Oh, that's easy.
[35:39.080 --> 35:40.000]  That's what we need, yeah.
[35:40.440 --> 35:42.260]  Latte cup silicone mold.
[35:42.680 --> 35:44.820]  Yeah, I'm trying to find bigger than shot glasses.
[35:45.240 --> 35:51.080]  Yeah, I mean, dude, honestly, this is like...
[35:51.760 --> 35:56.260]  To be able to make a five inches by two and a half inches is not gurpler size.
[35:56.260 --> 35:59.780]  But we have to start somewhere more of a proof of concept than anything.
[36:00.260 --> 36:02.200]  This one's this one's like a latte cup.
[36:02.900 --> 36:05.580]  Oh, a latte cup, a little latte cup gurpler.
[36:05.720 --> 36:07.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:07.080 --> 36:10.660]  Like so that and we can and then you can like get coffee with it and it can melt
[36:10.660 --> 36:12.060]  and it'll make your coffee worse.
[36:12.260 --> 36:13.700]  Like, that's pretty interesting, right?
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.320]  Like, wouldn't that be?
[36:15.620 --> 36:17.460]  Wouldn't that be cool to, like, make your coffee worse?
[36:18.780 --> 36:20.660]  Uh, wait, what is one inch deep?
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.260]  It's it's it's like a mold, I think, for...
[36:24.260 --> 36:24.900]  That's not a mold.
[36:24.900 --> 36:26.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:27.400 --> 36:28.240]  Yeah, sort of.
[36:28.640 --> 36:30.480]  Yeah, silicone mold.
[36:30.580 --> 36:31.260]  It says it.
[36:31.780 --> 36:35.140]  Yeah, but that's just going to be a solid piece right here.
[36:35.240 --> 36:35.520]  Hold on.
[36:35.580 --> 36:35.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:35.860 --> 36:36.360]  Check it out.
[36:36.800 --> 36:40.240]  You know, I don't know.
[36:40.400 --> 36:42.200]  Yeah, hold on.
[36:42.400 --> 36:43.780]  Coffee cup, silicone mold.
[36:44.600 --> 36:45.180]  Oh, is that OK?
[36:46.060 --> 36:46.560]  Yeah, I got it.
[36:46.560 --> 36:47.100]  Have a look at this.
[36:47.500 --> 36:49.360]  Yeah, that looks that's perfect for shot glasses.
[36:49.840 --> 36:51.400]  Yeah, I can find shot glass mold.
[36:51.480 --> 36:53.520]  Yeah, but I'm trying to find something bigger than that.
[36:53.520 --> 36:56.380]  Yeah, I think that's a good sample starter.
[36:57.180 --> 36:57.880]  Test it out.
[36:57.960 --> 36:59.880]  We can definitely make a gumbler with that, right?
[37:00.020 --> 37:00.660]  Yeah, for sure.
[37:00.900 --> 37:01.920]  Yeah, I think so.
[37:03.000 --> 37:03.880]  You can make a bunch of them.
[37:04.560 --> 37:04.780]  Yeah.
[37:05.240 --> 37:06.880]  What would you put in your gumbler, Gavin?
[37:07.480 --> 37:11.240]  Well, if it was that big, I assume I'd put a Bailey's or something.
[37:12.420 --> 37:13.560]  Bailey's in the gumbler?
[37:14.080 --> 37:15.240]  Yeah, yeah, Bailey's on ice.
[37:15.980 --> 37:19.760]  You buy that, we could build like little tubes full of
[37:19.760 --> 37:23.840]  a gummy bear that we could stick into a real gumbler.
[37:24.040 --> 37:25.740]  Like a telescopic gumbler?
[37:26.260 --> 37:28.760]  Yeah, you can freeze it and then that could be your gurple ice.
[37:29.600 --> 37:30.940]  Gumple ice for your gurple.
[37:31.580 --> 37:32.920]  Gumple ice for your gurple.
[37:33.060 --> 37:36.440]  This could be a great format to bring that Dodge to the Bov.
[37:37.340 --> 37:38.240]  Oh, Bovril.
[37:38.960 --> 37:42.980]  I would definitely have a Bovril shot out of a gumbler.
[37:45.580 --> 37:46.640]  That's what we got to do.
[37:47.120 --> 37:49.240]  Have a hot Bovril out of a cold gumbler.
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.360]  A Bovril shot out of a gumbler feels like I'm having a stroke.
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.140]  Yeah, somehow it's a really cool piece of supplemental content that we can now make.
[38:00.260 --> 38:01.020]  Oh, it sounds great.
[38:01.160 --> 38:01.580]  I love it.
[38:01.680 --> 38:02.640]  Oh, should I buy this thing?
[38:03.080 --> 38:03.260]  Yeah.
[38:03.600 --> 38:04.280]  Oh, definitely.
[38:04.960 --> 38:06.940]  Don't buy RX1 though, I don't know what that is.
[38:07.320 --> 38:07.980]  Nah, it would work.
[38:11.120 --> 38:14.280]  I found this one. It's a resin cast.
[38:16.180 --> 38:18.840]  So you can sort of like make it.
[38:18.980 --> 38:21.300]  It's like here's molds and then you pour stuff into the molds.
[38:21.720 --> 38:22.120]  Okay.
[38:22.340 --> 38:27.460]  And then you take the silicone off and then you have a cup.
[38:27.880 --> 38:30.440]  Is that food safe, that one? That's got pencils in it.
[38:31.140 --> 38:32.600]  Yeah, I don't think you have to eat the pencils.
[38:32.820 --> 38:34.780]  Oh, now we're worried about pencils being food safe?
[38:34.780 --> 38:36.580]  No kidding. Jesus Christ.
[38:37.040 --> 38:37.760]  All of a sudden.
[38:38.180 --> 38:39.900]  Oh, we got digital pencils?
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.960]  Yeah, well, I don't know what you're concerned about.
[38:42.100 --> 38:42.460]  Geez.
[38:42.760 --> 38:43.540]  Let me look at this thing.
[38:43.540 --> 38:45.460]  Sorry, I was buying the other one. Hold on, let me look at this thing.
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.840]  Okay. There's something to it. I don't know what, but something.
[38:49.960 --> 38:51.600]  What if... no, no, what if this for a mold?
[38:51.740 --> 38:52.460]  Yeah, this will work.
[38:53.200 --> 38:59.260]  Get a big... get an actual Gerpler, pour the stuff into it, fill it,
[38:59.520 --> 39:01.440]  and then just put a smaller cup in it.
[39:02.920 --> 39:03.280]  Okay.
[39:04.080 --> 39:04.440]  Okay.
[39:04.800 --> 39:05.020]  What?
[39:05.460 --> 39:06.020]  You're a genius.
[39:06.600 --> 39:07.280]  Wouldn't that work?
[39:07.840 --> 39:11.540]  I mean, we were talking about pouring it into a Gerpler earlier, but you seemed upset, so...
[39:12.620 --> 39:13.180]  we stopped.
[39:13.180 --> 39:17.660]  So we went down like a different avenue, so...
[39:18.540 --> 39:21.460]  We got a lot of different approaches. You can test multiple ways.
[39:21.940 --> 39:25.380]  Does anybody have a Gerpler they want to sacrifice for the testing of this?
[39:25.560 --> 39:26.300]  Gavin has three.
[39:26.680 --> 39:27.620]  Okay, that's a good point.
[39:28.960 --> 39:31.780]  Yeah, but we still need... did we ever make a smaller one?
[39:32.320 --> 39:33.060]  Not yet.
[39:33.620 --> 39:35.620]  No, I always wanted to make Gerple Jr.
[39:36.220 --> 39:40.840]  We just need one that's a similar... similar style, like ratio-wise,
[39:40.920 --> 39:43.080]  but a bit smaller to put as the inside of the mold.
[39:43.180 --> 39:46.560]  We want gummy bears, right?
[39:47.060 --> 39:47.200]  Yep.
[39:47.300 --> 39:47.700]  Yeah.
[39:47.880 --> 39:52.120]  Okay, so there's... I just sent a link for some bulk gummy bears.
[39:52.240 --> 39:55.820]  We can buy... looks like eight or five pounds here.
[39:56.600 --> 39:58.060]  So that might be good.
[39:58.500 --> 40:00.280]  It's a lot of Gerples. A lot of Gumblers.
[40:01.260 --> 40:02.620]  And then let me see if we can get purple.
[40:02.740 --> 40:05.420]  There are purple gummy bears also in bulk bags, so...
[40:06.620 --> 40:07.600]  we can do that also.
[40:08.420 --> 40:10.020]  I wonder if Gracie would want to get involved.
[40:10.020 --> 40:14.000]  I just edited both of those old videos, the apple pie and the melon one,
[40:14.260 --> 40:16.580]  and I just really like editing Gracie.
[40:16.860 --> 40:20.300]  Me and Nick saw her yesterday for 100% Eat,
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.200]  and she said that now that we have a place and everything,
[40:23.340 --> 40:24.360]  she wants to come and play.
[40:24.620 --> 40:27.200]  She calls hanging out and filming stuff playing.
[40:27.620 --> 40:32.520]  She wants to be in play mode, and she wants to come and play.
[40:32.860 --> 40:36.820]  Yeah, why don't you just text her then, Gumblers, are you in?
[40:37.780 --> 40:40.280]  Yeah, text her right now, are you in for Gumblers?
[40:40.800 --> 40:43.340]  Okay, all right, I'll text her right now.
[40:43.340 --> 40:47.480]  I'm buying some different sized Gerples-esque cups for us to try to get them.
[40:47.480 --> 40:49.480]  Did you order those gummy bears too or no?
[40:49.720 --> 40:50.800]  I haven't ordered the gummy bears.
[40:50.920 --> 40:52.040]  Okay, Gumblers?
[40:53.240 --> 40:54.420]  Gumblers, question mark?
[40:54.780 --> 40:57.380]  Or just Gumblers, period, are you in, question mark?
[40:57.520 --> 40:59.600]  Yes, Gumblers, period, are you in?
[41:00.100 --> 41:00.500]  Got it.
[41:01.440 --> 41:02.360]  Okay, I have texted her.
[41:02.360 --> 41:03.800]  She needs to know which show.
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.240]  I just wrote exactly what you guys told me.
[41:08.600 --> 41:09.380]  Regulation, Gumblers.
[41:09.840 --> 41:11.260]  I'll let you know if she texts me back.
[41:11.620 --> 41:12.420]  Okay, good to know.
[41:12.880 --> 41:18.180]  Yeah, so are you imagining that like we melt down all the greens in one thing,
[41:18.320 --> 41:24.480]  and then purples in the other thing, and then we sort of like mix, or what's the...
[41:24.480 --> 41:27.460]  You like pour the green, let it start to solidify, then pour the purple.
[41:27.800 --> 41:28.100]  Oh, really?
[41:28.320 --> 41:31.700]  It would look like the Gerple, Gerple.
[41:32.200 --> 41:33.220]  Yeah, I see, okay.
[41:33.940 --> 41:35.960]  Gracie simply said, I beg your pardon.
[41:36.300 --> 41:37.300]  Yeah, that's fair.
[41:37.400 --> 41:38.580]  I said that's not a yes.
[41:39.400 --> 41:40.140]  It's not a no, though.
[41:40.740 --> 41:42.560]  How many bags of this shit do I need to buy?
[41:43.380 --> 41:45.140]  Just one five-pound bag each.
[41:45.920 --> 41:48.040]  Okay, one of purple.
[41:48.780 --> 41:53.140]  Yeah, one of purple, and then one of the green in the link above, and that should be fine.
[41:54.400 --> 41:56.580]  Am I saying anything else to Gracie, or is that it?
[41:57.320 --> 41:58.360]  I think you're good.
[41:58.620 --> 41:59.980]  I think she's in by the sounds of it.
[41:59.980 --> 42:01.980]  You can clarify with Regulation Gumbler.
[42:02.720 --> 42:03.040]  Okay.
[42:05.200 --> 42:06.720]  Albany's Apple Crisp.
[42:06.980 --> 42:08.560]  I got a weird email yesterday.
[42:09.060 --> 42:09.320]  Oh, yeah?
[42:09.820 --> 42:18.260]  Got an email from a service saying, hey, your phone number has been attached to a different
[42:18.260 --> 42:18.700]  account.
[42:18.940 --> 42:24.360]  Just a heads up, the phone number on your account was just registered on a different account.
[42:24.740 --> 42:30.040]  As I looked at it, it was one of my old phone numbers that I don't use, obviously, anymore.
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.240]  And I thought, oh, that's funny.
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.020]  I guess it's back in service because I had an issue in the past where I went to try to
[42:36.020 --> 42:42.080]  recover an email or something, and it was connected to that and I couldn't change it.
[42:42.220 --> 42:44.620]  And I called the number just to see if it was still in service.
[42:44.620 --> 42:46.220]  And it wasn't at that time.
[42:46.640 --> 42:49.040]  So I got the alert saying that someone had used it.
[42:49.240 --> 42:50.320]  So I checked.
[42:50.400 --> 42:52.060]  It was already it was still saved in my phone.
[42:52.240 --> 42:53.540]  So I just texted them, hey.
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.300]  And then waited.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.920]  And I got a response back.
[42:57.080 --> 42:57.280]  Your old phone number.
[42:57.620 --> 42:59.300]  Yeah, I just texted my old phone number because it was mine.
[42:59.340 --> 43:00.080]  It was already in my phone.
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.040]  I said, hey, they replied eventually, hi.
[43:04.860 --> 43:06.640]  And then there was a delay.
[43:07.500 --> 43:08.800]  Is this Bob?
[43:08.880 --> 43:14.100]  And then a bunch of like, like messing with you faces like I guess Bob's a prankster,
[43:14.200 --> 43:15.080]  I'm assuming.
[43:16.100 --> 43:20.220]  And then I just replied back that it was me that I used to have the number.
[43:20.480 --> 43:22.760]  I saw that they had registered just saying hi.
[43:22.820 --> 43:27.020]  If they need me to change any numbers, let them know.
[43:27.300 --> 43:29.600]  Just let me know if like, I don't know.
[43:29.600 --> 43:32.840]  I'm sitting on something with that number that I'm not using anymore.
[43:32.880 --> 43:33.980]  Like it's just applied to an account.
[43:34.060 --> 43:34.500]  It's blocking.
[43:35.020 --> 43:39.720]  And they said that I guess they're trying to sync their Microsoft account.
[43:39.860 --> 43:42.220]  And it was tied to a Microsoft account of mine.
[43:42.300 --> 43:44.240]  So my name kept popping up.
[43:44.460 --> 43:45.880]  They're already familiar with it.
[43:46.580 --> 43:49.720]  And I thought it was a real pleasant interaction overall.
[43:50.420 --> 43:53.540]  But they have called me four times since then.
[43:53.820 --> 43:55.900]  And I just don't want to talk to this person.
[43:56.200 --> 43:58.860]  It has become an annoyance because I texted them.
[43:58.860 --> 44:00.980]  They can text me if they want to, if they need something.
[44:01.280 --> 44:02.260]  Why are they calling me?
[44:03.680 --> 44:05.000]  I think it might be someone who's older.
[44:05.440 --> 44:05.800]  Yeah.
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.180]  But we've texted already.
[44:07.260 --> 44:09.540]  We've gotten like seven texts back and forth.
[44:09.920 --> 44:11.400]  We've both introduced ourselves.
[44:12.120 --> 44:13.600]  I feel like we've set up a rapport.
[44:15.080 --> 44:16.800]  And now they just keep calling.
[44:17.020 --> 44:17.620]  And it's annoying.
[44:17.820 --> 44:20.860]  They might think about texting is how you think about phone calls.
[44:21.280 --> 44:22.960]  I think they think that I'm Bob.
[44:23.080 --> 44:25.820]  I don't think they believe that it's not Bob.
[44:25.820 --> 44:27.360]  And they keep calling to...
[44:27.360 --> 44:28.380]  That's my theory.
[44:28.380 --> 44:30.180]  I don't know why else they would be calling me.
[44:30.660 --> 44:31.960]  But why would they think you're Bob?
[44:32.420 --> 44:35.340]  I think that Bob sounds like a real prankster.
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.700]  And I think they just don't believe the story that I told them that I just used to have that number.
[44:40.920 --> 44:41.840]  And I was just texting.
[44:42.020 --> 44:44.720]  So they think their friend Bob has a different number.
[44:45.220 --> 44:49.520]  I think they think that Bob is pulling a joke on them, is my belief.
[44:50.240 --> 44:51.120]  But they keep calling.
[44:51.320 --> 44:54.160]  They didn't leave a voicemail on any of the calls.
[44:54.560 --> 44:57.620]  They did leave one, but it was like they clearly just didn't hang up in time.
[44:57.620 --> 44:58.980]  They didn't say anything.
[44:59.240 --> 45:02.180]  Can you send it like a voice note proving that you're not Bob?
[45:02.820 --> 45:03.600]  Yeah, I guess.
[45:03.820 --> 45:07.540]  That sounds like the kind of thing Bob would engineer to look like it's not him, though.
[45:08.520 --> 45:10.280]  Bob's a prankster after all.
[45:11.140 --> 45:14.600]  I would argue the more you try to explain to them you're not Bob,
[45:14.620 --> 45:16.320]  the more they're going to think you're Bob.
[45:16.600 --> 45:19.860]  Yeah, I don't really know what to do because I don't really want to answer their phone call.
[45:20.740 --> 45:23.040]  I kind of feel like you should.
[45:23.480 --> 45:27.060]  Because I'm also kind of convinced that they're mad at me for some reason.
[45:27.060 --> 45:28.620]  They're mad at you.
[45:28.780 --> 45:29.280]  I don't know.
[45:29.320 --> 45:32.840]  I just feel like that could be a possibility that they want to yell at me for some reason.
[45:32.840 --> 45:33.200]  What have you done?
[45:33.480 --> 45:34.400]  I haven't done anything.
[45:35.700 --> 45:38.200]  I think they want to yell at me.
[45:38.660 --> 45:41.600]  Do you think you could get in touch with Bob yourself?
[45:42.260 --> 45:44.840]  Oh, it's a pretty, pretty common name.
[45:45.140 --> 45:48.500]  Unfortunately, I don't know how I track down just Bob.
[45:48.920 --> 45:51.500]  Well, you'd have to check him down through their social media, probably.
[45:53.480 --> 45:55.000]  I see this is I don't know.
[45:55.040 --> 45:56.760]  I feel like it's getting deeper than I care about.
[45:56.760 --> 45:57.580]  I beg your pardon.
[46:00.020 --> 46:02.600]  I'll take one if that's the question is Gracie.
[46:02.680 --> 46:04.460]  Gracie just says that she'll just take a Gerbler.
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.020]  Just say we have to make them.
[46:08.760 --> 46:09.540]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:09.580 --> 46:10.880]  Texture, she does Bob.
[46:12.280 --> 46:13.980]  I mean, she can connect us.
[46:15.920 --> 46:17.680]  We have to make them.
[46:17.780 --> 46:19.560]  OK, yeah, yeah.
[46:19.700 --> 46:21.000]  Oh, we have to make them first.
[46:21.240 --> 46:22.840]  Do you want me to say, do we have to make them?
[46:22.860 --> 46:23.680]  Do you want to help?
[46:24.280 --> 46:25.060]  Do you want to?
[46:25.240 --> 46:25.780]  Yeah, there you go.
[46:25.780 --> 46:29.700]  Because then she's now now she's successfully tricked into doing something.
[46:30.020 --> 46:30.960]  Yeah, perfect.
[46:32.100 --> 46:35.020]  Your ear bud fell in a coffee cup.
[46:35.600 --> 46:36.920]  You need a taco.
[46:37.180 --> 46:38.120]  Pick me up.

[47:01.800 --> 47:06.320]  Have you ever thought that maybe the universe is trying to get you to be this Bob?
[47:06.720 --> 47:07.500]  It could be.
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.840]  Like maybe it's a sort of a touched by an angel situation where you're going to show up in their
[47:11.840 --> 47:17.920]  lives or even like Quantum Leap and provide some sort of a, you know, service to a family in need
[47:17.920 --> 47:19.900]  that helps them along in their journey.
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.040]  Well, here's the thing.
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.100]  I technically don't know if it's them calling me because they were all private number calls.
[47:26.300 --> 47:27.660]  It just said private number.
[47:28.020 --> 47:30.820]  Wait, you think just a withheld number is them?
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.760]  I assume so, because like, what are the odds that I text a random person and then I also
[47:36.500 --> 47:40.720]  receive four private number calls on the same day?
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.300]  My phone rings all the time with just random numbers and private numbers.
[47:44.480 --> 47:45.900]  I don't see it doesn't for me.
[47:46.200 --> 47:47.860]  I almost never get private.
[47:47.940 --> 47:50.500]  Should I text them and ask if they're calling me?
[47:51.040 --> 47:51.380]  Yeah.
[47:51.820 --> 47:52.080]  Yeah.
[47:52.260 --> 47:53.200]  I'll do that right now.
[47:53.200 --> 47:55.520]  Sorry, I missed a few calls.
[47:55.820 --> 47:57.460]  Ask them if they want a gumbler.
[47:58.280 --> 48:03.840]  The most insane part of this to me is that this person is unknowingly texting someone
[48:03.840 --> 48:10.100]  assuming they're Bob, but this person has an alter ego who is a prankster named Johnny Caviar.
[48:10.240 --> 48:12.300]  So they just think it's the wrong jokester.
[48:12.960 --> 48:13.240]  Yeah.
[48:14.120 --> 48:15.920]  They're talking to a jokester.
[48:15.920 --> 48:17.200]  Oh my god!
[48:17.740 --> 48:18.100]  Four...
[48:18.100 --> 48:21.040]  This is like when you try to hire an assassin, but you hire the wrong assassin,
[48:21.200 --> 48:22.060]  but they're still an assassin.
[48:27.220 --> 48:28.980]  Yeah, I'll see if they reply.
[48:29.620 --> 48:31.780]  What does a text to an assassin look like?
[48:31.880 --> 48:33.560]  Is it just like a name, a picture?
[48:34.760 --> 48:36.200]  Probably like GPS coordinates.
[48:36.680 --> 48:37.900]  Yeah, like what if you just got one?
[48:37.940 --> 48:41.300]  Would you think, oh, I guess I should just be an assassin today?
[48:41.480 --> 48:43.580]  I should just go to this location and kill whoever's there.
[48:44.500 --> 48:45.340]  Or warn them.
[48:45.920 --> 48:46.620]  Or warn them.
[48:46.980 --> 48:51.600]  I think if I just got randomly...
[48:52.860 --> 48:58.840]  If I just randomly got GPS coordinates, like latitude and longitude, and just a little
[48:58.840 --> 49:07.140]  picture of a emoji of a green light, I'm running as far away from those coordinates
[49:07.140 --> 49:07.920]  as humanly possible.
[49:08.480 --> 49:10.040]  That's the last place on earth I need to be.
[49:10.280 --> 49:12.580]  I think you got to Google where it is first and then...
[49:12.580 --> 49:13.200]  Oh yeah, of course.
[49:13.280 --> 49:13.600]  Of course.
[49:14.280 --> 49:16.080]  Oh, fuck, it's three blocks away.
[49:16.220 --> 49:19.240]  It's just a text saying, yeah, so I thought about it.
[49:19.320 --> 49:20.820]  I don't think we should kill Bob.
[49:21.560 --> 49:23.240]  It's like the most menacing.
[49:24.620 --> 49:27.600]  What's the best random text any of you have ever gotten?
[49:28.660 --> 49:29.600]  You ever get a good one?
[49:31.200 --> 49:32.260]  Mine are blocked, typically.
[49:33.580 --> 49:40.580]  Yeah, I got one earlier, a random text earlier today asking if I wanted to pay for some recipes
[49:40.580 --> 49:42.760]  for somebody's cookbook.
[49:42.760 --> 49:44.000]  It was some sort of spam.
[49:44.360 --> 49:46.120]  I didn't do that.
[49:47.100 --> 49:48.520]  Pay for recipes?
[49:49.120 --> 49:57.180]  Yeah, it was like, hi, I'm so-and-so, and I'm trying to use my family's recipes to
[49:58.100 --> 49:58.820]  further myself.
[49:59.060 --> 50:01.600]  And if you are interested and want to buy my recipe...
[50:01.600 --> 50:01.860]  I don't know.
[50:01.880 --> 50:02.660]  I didn't read the whole thing.
[50:02.820 --> 50:03.500]  Are they potions?
[50:04.020 --> 50:04.860]  Reported it as junk food.
[50:04.860 --> 50:05.620]  Yeah, what kind of recipes?
[50:05.700 --> 50:06.900]  I wonder what kind of recipes...
[50:06.900 --> 50:09.180]  You assume it's food, but it's got to be magic.
[50:09.400 --> 50:11.760]  Is there a way to look at deleted texts?
[50:12.760 --> 50:13.420]  Probably not.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.920]  My partner has a funny problem where somebody has mistaken their phone number for...
[50:23.340 --> 50:24.940]  Like, they're giving out the wrong number.
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.600]  They keep giving my partner's phone number to people thinking it's their number.
[50:30.480 --> 50:33.060]  And so they're constantly getting texts from, like,
[50:33.400 --> 50:37.080]  friends of this person and or things that they've signed up for.
[50:37.640 --> 50:40.220]  But it's largely friends, and they just ignore it.
[50:40.220 --> 50:43.120]  And if it was me, oh man, would I be getting in the mix?
[50:43.460 --> 50:45.180]  How are they doing that multiple times?
[50:45.300 --> 50:48.740]  Maybe they saved themselves as a contact with the wrong number.
[50:49.240 --> 50:51.700]  Like, surely you wouldn't say the wrong number.
[50:52.120 --> 50:53.960]  I think you could easily say the wrong number.
[50:54.440 --> 50:58.100]  I could absolutely imagine me getting my number wrong by, like,
[50:58.100 --> 51:01.080]  one digit or, like, accidentally flipping it when I say it.
[51:01.600 --> 51:03.740]  Yeah, but wrong in the same way multiple times?
[51:04.200 --> 51:04.980]  I think so, yeah.
[51:05.020 --> 51:08.980]  If I just lock it in in the wrong way, I absolutely could see myself doing that.
[51:09.080 --> 51:09.720]  But that's me.
[51:10.220 --> 51:13.940]  I feel like this is a problem that is not nearly as prevalent
[51:13.940 --> 51:16.180]  as it used to be earlier in my lifetime,
[51:16.440 --> 51:19.360]  when you would get wrong numbers constantly back in the days
[51:19.360 --> 51:21.840]  when people had to recite or write down phone numbers.
[51:22.300 --> 51:25.460]  But now, like, if you meet somebody and you want to get each other's phone number,
[51:25.460 --> 51:28.360]  you just text them and then you save their contact information, right?
[51:28.400 --> 51:29.440]  You, like, never...
[51:29.440 --> 51:31.980]  I would imagine a lot of people don't even know their own phone number.
[51:32.540 --> 51:33.800]  Oh, I didn't for a long time.
[51:34.240 --> 51:38.300]  I know. I know mine, my wife's, my daughter's, and Bernie's for some reason.
[51:38.560 --> 51:39.280]  I can't forget it.
[51:43.920 --> 51:46.320]  I've, I've, I've lived in this country so long,
[51:46.400 --> 51:48.840]  I started to forget my UK phone number.
[51:49.200 --> 51:52.940]  And the one that's replaced it is my first UK phone number.
[51:53.260 --> 51:53.680]  Oh.
[51:53.800 --> 51:55.500]  Because I'm on my second number in the UK.
[51:56.080 --> 51:57.040]  And that one's gone.
[51:57.120 --> 52:00.020]  And I remember the first one, which is completely useless to me.
[52:00.240 --> 52:01.300]  And I don't know why that one stuck.
[52:01.640 --> 52:04.560]  It's like, I remember my locker combination for sixth grade,
[52:04.580 --> 52:06.280]  but I don't remember any other locker combination.
[52:08.220 --> 52:08.880]  What was it?
[52:09.020 --> 52:09.820]  11, 36, 13.
[52:11.220 --> 52:11.620]  Wow.
[52:13.480 --> 52:14.580]  11, 36, 13.
[52:14.840 --> 52:17.520]  I've never used it on anything else, but I can't get it out of my head.
[52:17.660 --> 52:21.060]  And I, anytime I look at a new, like, twisty lock, I'm like, oh, fuck.
[52:21.240 --> 52:22.120]  11, 36, 13.
[52:22.720 --> 52:25.440]  It is hard to forget the first stuff you remember.
[52:26.020 --> 52:26.360]  Yeah.
[52:26.500 --> 52:28.400]  I still remember the first thing I was impressed by.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.020]  What was the first thing you were impressed by?
[52:31.360 --> 52:31.560]  What?
[52:34.540 --> 52:35.280]  I need to know.
[52:35.280 --> 52:38.860]  I think as a kid, you're often impressed by, like, by stuff that's shit.
[52:39.320 --> 52:39.500]  Yeah.
[52:39.500 --> 52:40.940]  But it's just the first time you've seen it.
[52:40.980 --> 52:44.020]  So it's like, whoa, I was impressed by a wet book.
[52:44.520 --> 52:45.220]  What do you mean?
[52:45.260 --> 52:49.880]  It was a, it was a book that had been rained on and it dried all like wavy.
[52:51.440 --> 52:52.800]  I was like, that is brilliant.
[52:52.980 --> 52:54.480]  It's like a book, but it's wavy.
[52:55.120 --> 53:00.600]  I just, I think, I think you almost don't know what impressed means.
[53:01.440 --> 53:02.180]  What do you mean?
[53:02.660 --> 53:03.680]  I thought it was great.
[53:04.780 --> 53:05.140]  Crazy.
[53:05.580 --> 53:08.840]  I used to, I used to take it out of the bookcase and show it to people when they came over.
[53:08.840 --> 53:09.140]  What?
[53:12.500 --> 53:15.740]  It was one of the first, it was one of the first weird things I saw.
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.200]  I was probably three, maybe four.
[53:19.920 --> 53:21.100]  Nick, yeah, yeah.
[53:21.120 --> 53:22.760]  Nick, could you imagine your kid doing that?
[53:22.820 --> 53:24.820]  Just going like, look, look at this book.
[53:25.020 --> 53:25.780]  Look at this.
[53:25.800 --> 53:26.580]  It used to be wet.
[53:27.280 --> 53:29.380]  Can you believe the rain's done this?
[53:29.960 --> 53:31.400]  It was one of my mom's books.
[53:31.700 --> 53:33.160]  Was it during the silent seers?
[53:33.960 --> 53:34.240]  Yeah.
[53:36.780 --> 53:38.740]  It's like a cartoon character.
[53:39.660 --> 53:42.960]  No, I just remember finding out from my mom, it was left out in the rain.
[53:43.300 --> 53:45.820]  And it was like the thing in the house.
[53:45.960 --> 53:46.840]  You're leaving books out.
[53:48.820 --> 53:50.340]  You know, this explains a lot.
[53:50.360 --> 53:52.500]  Because last time I was talking to your mom, I asked her,
[53:52.880 --> 53:55.800]  did you ever think like when Gavin was a small kid,
[53:55.860 --> 53:56.940]  like what he'd be when he grew up?
[53:56.960 --> 53:58.460]  And she was like, she was real quiet for a second.
[53:58.560 --> 54:00.440]  She goes, you know, honestly, I never did.
[54:00.520 --> 54:01.440]  And now I understand why.
[54:01.640 --> 54:03.000]  I don't think they had high hopes.
[54:03.760 --> 54:05.060]  Do you think you still have the book?
[54:05.660 --> 54:08.220]  They were like, oh, Christ, Grammy's going to come over.
[54:08.220 --> 54:09.860]  Gavin's going to bring out the wet book again.
[54:10.160 --> 54:11.340]  The wet book.
[54:11.400 --> 54:12.940]  Well, it wasn't wet anymore.
[54:13.140 --> 54:14.240]  It was just was once wet.
[54:14.640 --> 54:16.140]  Yeah, no, we get it.
[54:16.320 --> 54:17.200]  We get it.
[54:17.580 --> 54:17.840]  Yeah.
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.640]  Did you ever try to wet it again to make it go back to normal?
[54:21.100 --> 54:21.280]  No.
[54:22.240 --> 54:23.240]  Did you heat it up?
[54:24.520 --> 54:24.920]  No.
[54:25.760 --> 54:29.880]  Oh, I was also impressed by, uh, um, like pool cues.
[54:30.560 --> 54:33.600]  Like watching the move up up front on someone's hand.
[54:33.700 --> 54:35.260]  I was like, is it doing that on its own?
[54:35.320 --> 54:37.020]  Or is someone, is he pushing that?
[54:37.180 --> 54:38.100]  I was like, that's amazing.
[54:38.220 --> 54:40.700]  I used to love watching people play pool.
[54:40.940 --> 54:42.760]  I used to love watching wheels go around.
[54:42.860 --> 54:43.560]  I love the wet book.
[54:44.160 --> 54:45.640]  Like, do you not have anything like that?
[54:45.680 --> 54:47.440]  That's like really regular shitty stuff.
[54:47.820 --> 54:52.160]  Somebody just clipped that sentence where Gavin said all the things that impressed me.
[54:52.300 --> 54:54.320]  Like, wheel go round and wet book.
[54:54.620 --> 54:55.580]  I thought they were brilliant.
[54:56.240 --> 54:57.640]  Honestly, I thought they were so good.
[54:58.020 --> 55:00.000]  Dude, this is... what?
[55:00.200 --> 55:03.660]  I wish I did, Gav, but I was too busy slamming my dick in the toilet seat.
[55:05.820 --> 55:07.680]  I was on a different path than you.
[55:08.220 --> 55:10.320]  See, I would rather whip that out than what you were doing.
[55:10.900 --> 55:12.880]  I don't think I had anything like that.
[55:13.500 --> 55:15.200]  I definitely didn't have a wet book.
[55:17.760 --> 55:20.560]  You were surely impressed by something at an early age.
[55:20.580 --> 55:20.660]  Definitely.
[55:21.080 --> 55:21.240]  Kind of.
[55:21.760 --> 55:22.120]  Absolutely.
[55:22.700 --> 55:24.440]  I just, I didn't have like a go-to.
[55:26.420 --> 55:30.080]  There wasn't like a thing I would show people and be like, look at this fucking crazy.
[55:30.980 --> 55:32.300]  You see the waves on this page?
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.380]  We've talked in the past about my go-to story as a kid was when the wind rang the doorbell.
[55:37.380 --> 55:37.840]  Yeah.
[55:39.360 --> 55:41.700]  And they just get stuck, they just get burned in.
[55:42.140 --> 55:44.280]  You see, I opened the door and there was nobody there.
[55:45.840 --> 55:46.240]  Crazy.
[55:48.040 --> 55:50.820]  I immediately turned around and started reading my wet book.
[55:54.160 --> 55:55.980]  Do you remember what the book was?
[55:56.880 --> 55:58.200]  It was like a thick book?
[55:58.380 --> 55:59.260]  Was it a small book?
[55:59.440 --> 56:00.740]  It was probably like an inch thick.
[56:01.100 --> 56:01.460]  Okay.
[56:02.180 --> 56:03.520]  Do you think your family still has it?
[56:04.040 --> 56:04.600]  I don't know.
[56:04.700 --> 56:06.840]  People don't really throw books away.
[56:07.340 --> 56:08.200]  Not a wet book.
[56:08.680 --> 56:09.760]  Not donating that.
[56:10.660 --> 56:13.840]  To be honest, if there was a point where my mom was like,
[56:13.940 --> 56:17.040]  I'm going to get rid of all these old books and I was my age now,
[56:17.080 --> 56:18.960]  I would have a quick rummage for the wet one.
[56:19.200 --> 56:19.840]  You have to.
[56:20.600 --> 56:21.540]  You have to find the wet one.
[56:22.240 --> 56:23.800]  The foundational moment in your life.
[56:23.940 --> 56:27.700]  And when people come over, you have to have something to show them.
[56:28.340 --> 56:32.540]  Now you left out the part where you pissed on this book, right?
[56:32.600 --> 56:33.460]  Like that's how it got wet.
[56:33.720 --> 56:34.560]  Yeah, it's a piss book.
[56:34.760 --> 56:35.440]  Yeah, it's a piss book.
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.420]  I wasn't really like a wrong pisser.
[56:37.480 --> 56:40.060]  I just pissed my pants in the toilet like a normal kid.
[56:41.320 --> 56:42.960]  Do you have any other wet opinions?
[56:44.940 --> 56:48.060]  You have a positive wet and a negative wet, which I didn't expect.
[56:48.560 --> 56:50.260]  I think most wet is negative.
[56:50.760 --> 56:52.820]  He also likes, you also like wet works though, right?
[56:52.860 --> 56:54.820]  We talked about that forever ago.
[56:55.800 --> 56:56.600]  Wet works?
[56:57.180 --> 56:58.400]  Yeah, I think it was in the...
[56:58.400 --> 57:01.940]  We were talking about Johnny Mnemonic or something in sci-fi.
[57:02.580 --> 57:02.880]  Yeah, wet wear.
[57:03.320 --> 57:04.420]  Yeah, wet wear is brilliant.
[57:05.020 --> 57:08.040]  It's how they attach the wires to the rat or something.
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.180]  Do you think you could recreate the wavy book?
[57:11.560 --> 57:11.880]  No.
[57:12.860 --> 57:15.460]  Oh, I was going to say next time it rains, you should throw a book out there.
[57:15.820 --> 57:17.140]  Well, what book am I going to sacrifice?
[57:18.220 --> 57:21.380]  Uh, you got one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish or what?
[57:22.880 --> 57:25.460]  Oh, I've got like a philosopher's stone I could leave out there.
[57:25.780 --> 57:26.060]  There you go.
[57:26.080 --> 57:26.660]  Yeah, go ahead.
[57:27.200 --> 57:28.260]  Feel free to piss on that one too.
[57:28.740 --> 57:28.940]  Yeah.
[57:31.480 --> 57:33.820]  I guess it's a bad book because I want you to piss on something.
[57:33.820 --> 57:34.540]  Yeah.
[57:35.100 --> 57:36.400]  It's a weird request.
[57:37.140 --> 57:37.480]  Yeah.
[57:38.160 --> 57:40.020]  Geoff's really locked into the fetish content.
[57:41.360 --> 57:45.300]  Do you think a book that dried from pee would dry differently than a book that dried from rain?
[57:45.760 --> 57:46.400]  Different color.
[57:46.920 --> 57:48.760]  I mean, only one way to find out.
[57:49.580 --> 57:51.000]  I don't think I need to know.
[57:51.880 --> 57:53.640]  I mean, maybe I'll piss on it after.
[57:54.360 --> 57:55.460]  You guys are weird.
[57:55.640 --> 57:56.680]  Let's talk about kittens again.
[57:57.960 --> 57:59.780]  Gracie texted back and just said when.
[58:00.740 --> 58:00.980]  Sweet.
[58:01.520 --> 58:02.760]  I didn't get a text back.
[58:03.360 --> 58:04.660]  Oh, bummer.
[58:04.880 --> 58:05.780]  Yeah, sorry, man.
[58:06.340 --> 58:10.840]  I think, by the way, I think I discovered where it all went wrong for humanity.
[58:11.500 --> 58:17.240]  I feel like people are pretty much unhappy no matter where they are these days.
[58:17.480 --> 58:19.300]  And I think it's to do with Pluto.
[58:19.880 --> 58:24.300]  I think when Pluto got declassified, humanity got less happy.
[58:24.800 --> 58:25.660]  Because we lost a planet.
[58:26.320 --> 58:29.560]  Yeah, like some mysticism went away where
[58:29.560 --> 58:32.880]  I think the planets were magical and unalterable.
[58:33.020 --> 58:35.360]  And then we altered the planets and now things are different.
[58:35.660 --> 58:37.720]  Feel kind of that way about Brontosaurus too.
[58:38.420 --> 58:39.700]  Oh, that's another good one.
[58:39.980 --> 58:43.120]  So I think we should, even though they're wrong, like even though I think there's like bigger
[58:43.120 --> 58:47.500]  stuff than Pluto that's not a planet and there's like better orbits than Pluto that isn't a planet.
[58:47.860 --> 58:53.500]  I think we should just try for a year putting it back in and seeing if it's it's good for morale.
[58:54.220 --> 58:54.360]  Yeah.
[58:54.540 --> 58:55.480]  See, I feel the opposite.
[58:55.620 --> 58:57.820]  I don't care at all about the planets.
[58:58.740 --> 59:03.560]  I think if if Saturn went away, totally unaffected by it.
[59:04.560 --> 59:05.780]  Saturn's the cool one, man.
[59:06.500 --> 59:07.280]  Saturn's a banger.
[59:07.380 --> 59:07.800]  What do you mean?
[59:08.740 --> 59:09.860]  That's a top tier planet, dude.
[59:09.900 --> 59:10.700]  It's a gas giant.
[59:10.820 --> 59:11.380]  It floats.
[59:11.460 --> 59:12.100]  It's got a ring.
[59:12.440 --> 59:16.000]  Yeah, I'm not saying it's not a good planet, but let's say Saturn vanished.
[59:16.120 --> 59:16.640]  It disappeared.
[59:17.200 --> 59:17.940]  I wouldn't care.
[59:18.780 --> 59:19.360]  Somebody wouldn't.
[59:19.500 --> 59:21.420]  I wouldn't even be aware that it happened.
[59:21.520 --> 59:22.880]  My life would just continue on.
[59:23.160 --> 59:25.020]  And then someone would say, hey, you hear about Saturn?
[59:25.160 --> 59:25.840]  I'd say no.
[59:26.400 --> 59:27.440]  And they'd tell me and I'd go.
[59:27.440 --> 59:30.260]  You could say the same for, like, a guy somewhere.
[59:31.280 --> 59:31.460]  What?
[59:32.100 --> 59:33.100]  Maybe his name's Saturn.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.740]  Steven Saturn is gone.
[59:36.920 --> 59:37.920]  Did he get left out in the rain?
[59:38.840 --> 59:40.500]  Yeah, somebody pissed on him.
[59:40.540 --> 59:44.300]  Like, what if there was some, like, guy, he lives in Latvia, you've never met him,
[59:44.320 --> 59:45.200]  you never will, he vanished.
[59:45.540 --> 59:46.520]  Wouldn't change your life at all.
[59:46.940 --> 59:49.520]  I'd be way more impacted by that than the planet.
[59:50.100 --> 59:51.100]  Okay, it just happened.
[59:51.820 --> 59:52.460]  That sucks.
[59:52.840 --> 59:56.860]  I hope he gets found, I guess.
[59:56.860 --> 59:59.380]  What about all the aliens that are secretly living on Saturn?
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.200]  Whole communities, families, potentially.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.380]  I think Saturn has some good moons as well.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:04.760]  Does.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.320]  I've played Starfield, there was nothing there.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.160]  That was an empty one.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.020]  What happens to the moons when the planet blinks out?
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.580]  Yeah, what if it hurled one of its moons back across the solar system
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.360]  because it's not orbiting Saturn anymore?
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.480]  That sounds like a problem for someone.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.400]  For you!
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.420]  Could be a problem for you.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.800]  Well, it could be, then I'd be really worried about it.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.360]  I'm not saying we should remove Saturn.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.280]  I'm just saying that unless, like, there was some effect to the Earth,
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.420]  it would really... it just wouldn't move me.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.460]  I'm indifferent to planets.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.120]  So where do you think it all went wrong, Andrew?
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.560]  If it's not the brontosaurus and it's not Saturn.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.840]  Losing it, I think, is the...
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.260]  We've never recovered as a society.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.680]  That's before you were born.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.560]  So that means... does that mean you've never been happy?
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.100]  No, I've definitely been happy.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.080]  I don't think my happiness, though, is an indicator of where things went wrong.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:04.180]  Do you think you were more happy or less happy before 2007?
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.240]  Oh, way more happy.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.000]  This one, I'm telling you.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.340]  Significantly happier.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.340]  Post-2007.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:12.980]  Oh, post-2007.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.560]  Post-2007, yeah, way happier.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:15.200]  Oh, sorry.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.120]  I thought... didn't everything go wrong when we turned on the Hadron Collider?
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.100]  Wasn't that what... what screwed us all?
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.960]  Now we're all dead or something?
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.900]  Or we're in an alternate universe, or...
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:25.860]  Possibly.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.960]  And got all muxed up.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.980]  Yeah, I don't care about any of that.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.560]  If the Mandela Effect... like, if it was confirmed somehow that we were...
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.540]  we shifted universes, don't care.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.100]  Doesn't matter.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.420]  I feel like that would be podcast material.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.300]  I feel like that'd be interesting to talk about.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.600]  It would be interesting to talk about, but it's like, I don't... I don't really care.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.060]  Like, if it was confirmed that there are multiverses, right?
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.580]  Or there are at least multiple universes that live in parallel to ours,
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.200]  wouldn't it be fun to try to postulate, like, how...
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:55.440]  Yes.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.780]  The planet next to us is just slightly different.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.240]  Like, Justin Bieber has black hair, but everything else is the same.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:08.060]  I would wonder if there were more versions of me that don't like pants or less.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.100]  Right. Get into, like, the Rick and Morty of it.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.600]  Am I, like, in the minority of that take of me's?
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:18.760]  Or is, like, 90% me against pants?
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.760]  Because there are an Andrew out there in the universe that only wears flannel.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.180]  Fucking crazy.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.300]  When was the last time you popped on a pair of trousers?
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.060]  We've talked about this. It's been over a decade.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.900]  Holy shit.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.820]  20... you know what? 2015.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.100]  2015 was the last. It's been exactly a decade.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.300]  Or when did Destiny come out?
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:44.780]  2014?
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.060]  2014.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.580]  2014 was the last time.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.080]  The only time he puts on pants is for video game launches.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.960]  I was working at a warehouse, and it was before Destiny's launch,
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.880]  and they were being audited, so they made me put pants on.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.960]  So I had to buy sweats.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.520]  Did you have to buy that pair of pants for the audit?
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.420]  Yes. I had audit sweats.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.420]  I wore them for three days and then went back to my shorts.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.460]  Do you still have your audit sweats?
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:17.800]  I might. You know what? I just got rid of a bunch of stuff.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.340]  I don't know if I got rid of my audit sweats.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.940]  What's a... let's do a check-in.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.360]  What's the situation with your headboard? Is it still downstairs?
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.460]  It's halfway up. It's halfway there. Made progress.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.440]  What was the reasoning behind finally getting around to it and then stopping halfway?
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.040]  Because I still need to adjust some things in here.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:43.560]  I'm completely changing out my storage situation and my closet.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.420]  I'm making more space.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:50.460]  And once everything else is cleaned up, pulling it up.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.400]  You're just not to that step in the project yet.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.580]  Exactly. Yeah. It's this whole upper level is changing.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.860]  There's a lot of shifting, getting rid of beds and stuff.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:06.120]  So when you say it's halfway up, it immediately calls to mind
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.220]  a headboard precariously hanging halfway up a flight of stairs.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.860]  I'm assuming that's not the case.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.700]  You mean that the work upstairs is halfway complete
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.720]  before you can then bring the headboard up?
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.360]  Yes. Okay.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.640]  That is an insane way of saying that.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.380]  You know, I just learned that Pluto went away.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.480]  And so it's really thrown me all day.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.660]  He's still reeling from the invasion.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.920]  I apologize. That's on me.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.820]  Just to be clear, it's still there. The actual bull.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.420]  Yeah, but it's not a planet, right?
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.320]  If you had to blow up one planet, which one do you pick?
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.540]  Whoa, it was not.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.040]  They said it was not.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840]  That's crazy.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.540]  Then who called me four times?
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.120]  Who the fuck was that?
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.220]  That's now we got a mystery.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.820]  See, now that sounds like a call you should have answered.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.120]  Now I got to answer this private call.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.020]  This is crazy.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.600]  I hope they call again.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.900]  He's calling me.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:02.820]  That's yeah.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:08.080]  Before we wrap up, I have one more clip that I think is really funny.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.400]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.860]  I got a clip.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.320]  And to be specific, the audience has a clip.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.620]  Oh, my God.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.180]  Gavis has a blow up a planet, too.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.260]  He does.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.880]  I have a I have a counter to this, but it's still very funny.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:27.600]  This is the clip.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:32.300]  Andrew is always asking very inquisitive questions while I play Halo.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.320]  He said, you know, get to know each other, even still to this point.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.340]  Of course, he asked me why I was interested in or how I got into slow mo.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.300]  What made me interested?
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.240]  And I said it was an episode of Tom and Jerry.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:44.460]  Great episode.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.600]  Great episode.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.540]  I want to obviously that was in reference to me bashing the Australian morning show.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.940]  Seems like a really good question there, Andrew.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.480]  Yeah, I mean, that's hilarious.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.240]  I would argue two things.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:01.100]  One, I was asking more about your interest generally, not how you started your channel.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.500]  Second of all, I did not ask you to do an interview.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.540]  This was not we weren't conducting an interview.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.480]  We're just playing Halo.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.680]  It's just yeah.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.040]  But you wanted me to answer the question.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.620]  Otherwise, yeah, but it was small talk.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.200]  It's different.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.340]  But his time with you in that moment was infinite and he wasn't looking at the clock.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.620]  I'm sure if you said now Gavin only has time for seven more questions, that probably wouldn't
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.040]  have come up.
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.620]  No, I would not ask that question.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:26.700]  If I was conducting a proper interview with Gavin, I would not ask that.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.800]  Very interesting audience there with a banger clip.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.520]  Yeah, I just replied with like a huge string of laughter.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.120]  It was great.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:34.940]  I laughed so hard.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:39.620]  Also, I don't have it, but I hear there's a clip of like a year ago of Gavin betting
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:44.040]  Eric $100 that GTA 6 won't get delayed into 2026.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.600]  Who bet which way?
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.540]  I thought it didn't.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:47.560]  I say that it would get delayed.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.260]  I think he said that it wouldn't.
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:49.560]  I don't know.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.360]  I'd have to go find the clip, but I saw it on Reddit this morning.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.100]  Here's the thing.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:52.460]  Really?
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:57.980]  If if it's getting if if Gavin said it's not getting delayed and I said it is,
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.700]  then I'm happy with this bet.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:06.240]  But if it was the other way, I don't think it happened and I don't remember it.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.500]  Similar sort of vibe you bring to Pico Park there.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.720]  Yeah, you know, it is what it is.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.460]  Laughing with this thing on is so painful.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.580]  Oh, are we ending with behind the mask?
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:18.900]  Oh, wow.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.060]  Real quick, Gavin, why are you blowing up Mars?
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.640]  I don't think I would do Mars.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:23.700]  I hope not.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:24.740]  That's a big one.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.960]  I just learned that Mercury has a tail.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.160]  That's pretty cool.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.040]  Yeah.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.980]  See, when I put my mask on, it's not going to sound as funny.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.580]  Should I go and get mine?
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:37.660]  Yeah, please do.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.560]  They'll be beautiful from a shooting star.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.360]  Can you breathe better in it or?
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.300]  When I'm not talking.
[01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:55.890]  You sound like Bane.
[01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:59.630]  I was born to sleep.
[01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.990]  Is that what Bane's fucking whole beef was?
[01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:06.330]  He needed a CPAP?
[01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.610]  Yeah, he's got the apnea the whole time, dude.
[01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:09.250]  That's crazy.
[01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.450]  Wow, he never had good sleep, poor bastard.
[01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:13.170]  No wonder he's cranky.
[01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:13.790]  Yeah.
[01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:15.990]  I can make it worse, actually.
[01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.410]  One sec, I'll be right back.
[01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:22.150]  I think Neptune's the prettiest planet, but I might...
[01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:22.510]  I don't know.
[01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:26.470]  Uranus seems obvious. It's a stupid name.
[01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.330]  Yeah.
[01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:28.990]  But I think I get rid of that.
[01:08:29.650 --> 01:08:31.090]  Do you really say Uranus?
[01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:34.670]  I guess I say Uranus. I don't know. Uranus, Uranus, whatever.
[01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:35.570]  I'm a big Uranus guy.
[01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:37.250]  Either way, I'm...
[01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.170]  Yeah, I bet you are.
[01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:39.470]  Uh-huh.
[01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:43.130]  Yeah, all right. I'm on the pat.
[01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:44.790]  Okay, Andrew, you back?
[01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:46.390]  One sec.
[01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:52.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to get a preview
[01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:55.890]  of a brand new show from the Regulation Podcast Company.
[01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:58.330]  Very excited about this one.
[01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:02.150]  I think that this has never been attempted before in the history of podcasting,
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:04.570]  and we are going to be on the forefront, leading the edge.
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:08.450]  As you know, we are a self-help and wellness podcast,
[01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:09.530]  and we try to promote wellness.
[01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:16.030]  And one of the ways that we're doing that is to de-stigmatize and de-mystify CPAPs.
[01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.490]  I present to you, Behind the Mask.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.520]  I cranked mine up to full power!
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.180]  What did you say?
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.300]  How's it going, Gavin?
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.080]  Oh, are you at full beats?
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.140]  How many...
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.540]  What number is yours at?
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.060]  Twenty-five!
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.080]  God, how's it even staying on...
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.680]  Oh God, how's it even staying on your head?
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:55.120]  I'm having to secure it with my hand and when my mouth is closed it fills with air!
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.780]  Let's never do this again!
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.880]  This is a terrible idea!
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.260]  Yeah, this is Behind the Mask as a pretty short runway.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.940]  It's kind of talky, but it kind of makes me want to throw up.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.140]  Really?
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.900]  You could like, hiss with it.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.340]  That's cool.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.000]  You could go like...
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.620]  That didn't come through at all!
[01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:31.110]  I would love to hear you guys review a movie together.
[01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.810]  Yeah.
[01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.070]  Tune in to Carry It Away!
[01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.190]  We're watching all the Jim Carrey movies!
[01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:47.910]  Okay, we need to stop this.
[01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.470]  This is bad.
[01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:51.730]  Yeah, Geoff, you want to button this one up for us?
[01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:52.750]  This is bad.
[01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:57.730]  I'd like to end it here, take it out.
[01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.750]  But I think it'd be better if Andrew did.
[01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:00.450]  Oh, okay.
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:02.370]  Andrew, send us off.
[01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:07.330]  Thanks for listening to the Regulation Podcast!
[01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:11.030]  Make sure to check out our Patreon!
[01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:14.890]  Have a great day!
[01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:18.790]  Normalize CPAPs!
