[00:00.000 --> 00:03.560]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.940 --> 00:08.640]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of
[00:08.640 --> 00:13.620]  handcrafted brown sugar cold foam. Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino
[00:13.620 --> 00:20.240]  is ready at Starbucks. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:21.060 --> 00:27.140]  This is number 12, I believe, but it's not in the chat. So let me write it. Scroll up.
[00:27.140 --> 00:31.060]  There it is, number 12. Right there. It's in twice. We're double covered. Excellent.
[00:31.220 --> 00:35.740]  Great job, everybody. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey,
[00:36.860 --> 00:42.500]  Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour. This time in Inside Out order. How's everybody doing?
[00:42.940 --> 00:52.320]  Dozen. In the bag. What? What? Dozen episodes. Not yet. Oh. Well, this isn't in the bag yet.
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.400]  We haven't completed this one. No, we're still looking for the bag. We're still bagging.
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.060]  We're still bagging. We're close. We're almost ready to put the metal bread tie on.
[01:01.600 --> 01:06.520]  Bread is next week. That'll be the baker's dozen. Oh. How much is a baker's dozen?
[01:08.380 --> 01:10.520]  Thirteen. Why do the bakers got to be special?
[01:12.180 --> 01:15.560]  Why can't they just live by everyone else's dozen? You think it should be a plumber's dozen?
[01:16.100 --> 01:19.500]  It's a good thing. They're giving you an extra with everything. It's like saying
[01:19.500 --> 01:22.080]  breakers are good people. They're giving you, you know, giving you a hookup.
[01:23.500 --> 01:26.700]  Who's giving me what? Bakers, they give you it.
[01:28.300 --> 01:34.880]  Something's happened to Andrew's comprehension ability, I think. No, I'm good. Oh, I heard
[01:34.880 --> 01:42.600]  bakers. I didn't. Go ahead. No, it's been a long day already. Audience, you don't know this,
[01:42.660 --> 01:49.720]  but we recorded an Olympic thing this morning that I felt like I ran a marathon halfway through it.
[01:50.280 --> 01:53.620]  I feel like we deserved some of us deserved gold medals just for making it through.
[01:53.780 --> 01:59.320]  And then we recorded a very high energy Let's Play and then took a break. And then now we're back
[01:59.320 --> 02:07.560]  to to hit it hard on this episode of the Right Nation podcast. Oh, yeah. Hard and hard. It's
[02:07.560 --> 02:14.700]  been just immediately quiet. Like what happened? Hard. I think it's been a real feisty couple of
[02:14.700 --> 02:22.200]  weeks because we've had a lot of arguments. The drinks draft came out and the winner,
[02:22.400 --> 02:25.780]  the community have gone a certain way with it. I don't know if I agree with it.
[02:27.760 --> 02:33.280]  We actually had a big argument about it again yesterday in really. Yeah. Last of us.
[02:33.640 --> 02:38.700]  If you want my original reaction to the Alex, that was everyone's response to the drinks draft.
[02:38.700 --> 02:46.300]  Check out Nick's last of us stream VOD. What was surprising to me wasn't just that
[02:46.300 --> 02:51.660]  people sided with Nick were the people saying that you were wrong for drafting the way you did.
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.740]  That's what I thought was hilarious. I don't I don't want to get into it again.
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.600]  It is. I think it's a draft. It's a draft. There's a pool of things to pick.
[03:00.740 --> 03:05.240]  That's right. Here's the thing, Gavin. I think that you're right. I think your draft was good.
[03:05.240 --> 03:14.040]  I think you did a great job. I also think that you are battling against years of what the
[03:14.040 --> 03:21.180]  community thinks and feels about you. And so you are really having to fight your way uphill on
[03:21.180 --> 03:26.360]  something like that. So I don't say it. I don't deserve it. I'm just saying I don't agree with it.
[03:28.740 --> 03:32.900]  I think you don't deserve it. But I think, OK, I mean, either way, I guess
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.860]  it's there was there was a lot of.
[03:39.520 --> 03:45.340]  Picking coffee is like picking soda. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. All right, because coffee
[03:45.340 --> 03:52.960]  is a thing that grows. It's a bean. Soda isn't a thing. Are you saying it's like I'm not saying
[03:52.960 --> 03:59.960]  carbon dioxide. Soda is just a way of having something. Yeah, I agree with you there. It's
[03:59.960 --> 04:04.140]  fizzy. Yeah. When people were like, well, what if Andrew drafted soda? And it's like,
[04:04.140 --> 04:08.060]  I think we were pretty specific about how you couldn't do that. And we had to get specific
[04:08.060 --> 04:12.420]  there. And then the coffee thing happened. And then here we are. You know, I'm over it. I'm
[04:12.420 --> 04:16.620]  over it. Yeah, I can tell. I can tell by the way you're saying I'm over it. You're definitely over
[04:16.620 --> 04:22.060]  it. You are definitely not going to be over it anytime soon. I got a game, Gavin, if it might
[04:22.060 --> 04:26.340]  make you feel better. You want to turn things around. I got a little. I'm going to guess the
[04:26.340 --> 04:33.160]  coffee. It's a guessing game. It isn't guess the coffee. Not a great audible game. Very visual.
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.940]  But inspired by a game that you made, Gavin. I don't mean a lot of sass. This is a game that
[04:38.940 --> 04:46.660]  you made a spinoff of it. We tried to determine how how well a person could be detected by their
[04:46.660 --> 04:54.380]  teeth, how known they could be recognizable. And I wanted to expand on that idea because we did
[04:54.380 --> 05:00.560]  terrible. We did not do well. I'm pretty sure everyone was right. I think I got everyone right.
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.300]  Oh, I didn't really. Why do you think we didn't do well? Is that just like an assumption?
[05:06.080 --> 05:12.080]  What did you do? What have you done with Andrew? And can we have him back? Are you OK? Did you
[05:12.080 --> 05:19.980]  sleep last night? I slept too well. Maybe. Maybe that's the problem. I woke up today and yeah,
[05:20.080 --> 05:25.180]  it was a great sleep. Anyway, maybe we'll do worse than with this one. It's still a game.
[05:25.920 --> 05:33.140]  It's still playable. We did teeth before people say eyes, the vessel to the soul or whatever.
[05:33.280 --> 05:39.080]  I got some eyes. I got some famous eyes for you guys to see if you can recognize famous soul
[05:39.080 --> 05:48.600]  vessels. Do you think that's the phrase? Who these eyes be? That's Jeff. Yeah, that's absolutely
[05:48.600 --> 05:55.680]  eyes. No. Yeah. Yeah. Jeff is famous. No, not yet. Yeah. He's been on. He's been on shows
[05:55.680 --> 05:59.700]  like people know who he is. They ask him for autographs. Are you saying these aren't us?
[06:00.000 --> 06:10.440]  They are not us. Oh, oh, Remy Malek. Oh, OK. It's not Remy Malek. These are celebrity eyes.
[06:11.100 --> 06:18.140]  Celebrity eyes. I reckon Jake Gyllenhaal. Oh, wow. You think Remy Malek and Jake Gyllenhaal
[06:18.140 --> 06:27.980]  have similar eyes? Steve Buscemi. I like that. Yes, a lot. Pauly Short. I like that as well.
[06:28.340 --> 06:35.600]  Nobody's close. That's OK, because there are layers to this game. Oh, God. What? You haven't
[06:35.600 --> 06:43.460]  been able to figure out via the eyes. Let's pop in another facial feature. You got some lips to
[06:43.460 --> 06:50.880]  deal with now as well. You got eyes and you got some mouth. Oh, Vin Diesel. I can see it.
[06:51.320 --> 06:55.520]  I didn't know I could see it, but you're right. It doesn't look like Vin Diesel. It's not.
[06:56.040 --> 07:01.620]  This particular image looks like the worst Sonic the Hedgehog you could come up with.
[07:03.220 --> 07:08.720]  I would argue that this is the best Sonic the Hedgehog. Did you by any chance scribble? Why
[07:08.720 --> 07:12.720]  are the eyes cut out in two different ways? Yeah, that's what I hate. I was about to say,
[07:12.720 --> 07:21.440]  why did you do that? They're in different places. Because I took the base photo and then I would go
[07:22.480 --> 07:28.080]  and I'd make it all blue. You didn't just work backwards and just like remove the face? He did
[07:28.080 --> 07:37.140]  not. He did the eyes and then he came up with this next idea. He started from scratch every one of
[07:37.140 --> 07:42.700]  these. So for those who can't see what we're talking about, it looks like by hand he scribbled
[07:42.700 --> 07:51.280]  over the entire rest of the face instead of just cutting the eyes out. Yeah. I don't know.
[07:51.700 --> 07:58.240]  Andrew, do we have more features to see? Oh, you sure do. Last but not least, we're getting the
[07:58.240 --> 08:07.120]  nose in there as well. Is this the guy from Dexter? No. I really thought you guys would get this one.
[08:07.120 --> 08:11.960]  I feel like this is the easiest. Is that Jensen Ackles? Not even close. That's a strong nose.
[08:12.600 --> 08:20.040]  I have no idea. Not even close. Is it the rock? No. It's cut out in such a weird way as to disguise
[08:20.040 --> 08:24.720]  too much and differently each time. Yeah, the top of that, it looks like a shirt.
[08:25.240 --> 08:30.580]  Differently each time is fucking me up. Yeah, it really is. Me too. Yeah, in like a big way.
[08:30.760 --> 08:35.340]  In like a really big way. Okay, well, it doesn't seem like we have much success, so let's flip
[08:35.340 --> 08:43.480]  this game on its head. Now, I'm going to present the celebrity with only their features covered.
[08:45.800 --> 08:51.800]  What? The reverse of what we've been doing. Oh, it's Verne Troyer? Verne Troyer! Dude,
[08:51.880 --> 08:56.280]  I don't see. Go back up. Scroll back up and look at those images. None of them look like
[08:56.280 --> 09:00.360]  Verne Troyer, dude. Even knowing that it's Verne Troyer, it doesn't at all look like him. No.
[09:00.360 --> 09:06.700]  At all. Absolutely. At all. No. No, not at all. That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
[09:08.040 --> 09:13.800]  That last... Jeff, can that be the thumbnail of this last picture? It might give up too much,
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.540]  but boy, it's a really haunting photo. Please tell me you've got more of these. Oh yeah,
[09:19.660 --> 09:25.500]  absolutely I do. I haven't seen the movie Long Legs, but I assume it's like what that last
[09:25.500 --> 09:29.940]  Verne Troyer photo is where you've just scribbled over parts of him. Oh my god. This is better than
[09:29.940 --> 09:36.340]  quiz with balls. This is even better than the quiz with balls. Yep. Okay, here's the next one.
[09:36.860 --> 09:40.680]  Apologize for our audio listening. You might want to watch the video of this if you want to play
[09:40.680 --> 09:51.200]  along. It's on YouTube. It's on YouTube. Next set of celebrity eyes. Regulatrion. Oh. Is it Richard
[09:51.200 --> 09:57.360]  from Lost? No, it's not Richard from Lost. No, they're not full enough. The eyelashes aren't
[09:57.360 --> 10:01.820]  full enough. That's a great guess though. Yeah, yeah, I like where you're thinking. I like where
[10:01.820 --> 10:11.060]  your head's at. Is it Saeed from Lost? No. Jack from Lost. No, it was not on Lost. Okay, are you
[10:11.060 --> 10:16.400]  sure? Are they in Star Wars? It looks like the Death Star in their eyes in the reflection. I
[10:16.400 --> 10:22.360]  don't think they were in Star Wars, but if you would tell me that they were, I'd say okay. Sure,
[10:22.420 --> 10:26.900]  I could see it. I think this is going to be a reveal to a picture that has the face covered
[10:26.900 --> 10:33.360]  anyway, like Zorro. Yeah, now here's what I'll say. I can't wait to see what is covered up
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.840]  differently in the next photo. So why don't we go ahead and see the nose? Okay, let's see. We're
[10:38.840 --> 10:47.440]  going to include the nose in one second. We're not including the nose, we're doing lips. Lips next.
[10:47.900 --> 10:53.180]  Oh, sorry, right, yeah, lips. Lips next order. He scribbled it all wrong and different again.
[10:53.180 --> 11:01.360]  This is, the eyes are so different. His right eye looks like a puzzle piece. Same eyes.
[11:02.660 --> 11:09.460]  Is this a movie star? It's a movie star. Is that Felicity Jones? No, it's a man. Oh,
[11:09.520 --> 11:16.440]  it's a man, sweet. It's a man. Is it Denzel Washington? Nope. I think he's too white for
[11:16.440 --> 11:22.300]  that. White man. Yeah, why don't, why don't we check out the nose and we can really get a look
[11:22.300 --> 11:26.260]  at the nose. Then you have no hope. I feel like the nose gives away a lot. Andrew, I have to,
[11:26.260 --> 11:33.200]  I have to have you know that how bad this is. Oh, it's Matthew McConaughey. This, now see how,
[11:34.280 --> 11:39.000]  see how this is like a great cutout of him, but it also makes him look like a superhero. Okay,
[11:39.060 --> 11:44.380]  Jesus fucking Christ. Hey, hey, Jeff, I take back. He made an angel with the wings. Yeah,
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.860]  Verne Troy was a t-shirt. This is an angel. Yeah, Jeff, I take back what I said. Can this
[11:48.860 --> 11:53.780]  Matthew McConaughey picture be the thumbnail? I think that's our thumbnail, yeah. It's fucking
[11:53.780 --> 12:02.140]  insane. I got one more. Oh, I love it. Please. I love it. Wrap this game up. Sorry, audio-only
[12:02.140 --> 12:06.940]  listeners, you should really pop in. Check this out. Check out the Instagram. I'll have,
[12:07.040 --> 12:13.220]  I'll post it all. Okay, here we go. Here's the first. The eyes. Who's that celebrity?
[12:13.720 --> 12:20.640]  The eyes have it. Oh, Jesse Plemons. Wow.
[12:23.520 --> 12:32.540]  Um, this is, is this, oh, um, is this a movie star? They're all movie stars. Okay. Ryan Reynolds.
[12:33.440 --> 12:41.780]  No. Is it Bradley Cooper? No. Fuck. All of these people have been in the same movie together.
[12:42.460 --> 12:48.720]  What? Oh, they have? Okay. Let's see the next, let's see the lips, I guess. You want to see
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.480]  them lips? Let's show me them, show me them lips. What them lips do? What them lips do?
[12:54.840 --> 13:02.300]  What the fuck? Gavin, did this help you at all? Matt Damon. Jesse Plemons. I, it's so clear to me.
[13:02.720 --> 13:06.080]  I can see it very clear. You put it together. Of course you see it.
[13:08.980 --> 13:11.420]  It's not Jesse Plemons. You're really hung up on Jesse Plemons.
[13:11.780 --> 13:15.660]  I love seeing it's the Plemmeister. Leonardo DiCaprio. It's Leonardo DiCaprio.
[13:16.320 --> 13:22.940]  Eric's got it. Yeah. He can see them lips. If you squint and look at it sideways, and then he said
[13:22.940 --> 13:27.800]  all these people are in a movie, like Matthew McConaughey and Leonardo DiCaprio and Wolf of
[13:27.800 --> 13:34.060]  Wall Street, right? Like that's what, that's where your head was? Uh, I just said that to be like,
[13:34.100 --> 13:38.100]  create a fun fact that wasn't real. I just, cause I'm a Troyer, I don't think it's been in anything.
[13:38.100 --> 13:42.520]  Oh, so that's the only reason I guessed Leonardo DiCaprio. That's great.
[13:43.980 --> 13:47.720]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Easy game. It's clearly Leonardo DiCaprio.
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.900]  Now let's see his face cut out. Yeah, let me, I just got to save these images.
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.580]  Are you scribbling on the fly? Wait, what do you mean?
[13:58.220 --> 14:03.020]  It's, well, I, I'm using Gavin, the phone Gavin sent me. So when I did this, it was on the
[14:03.560 --> 14:11.000]  UbiDigiBison. Did you 3D scan your head yet? No, not yet. No, he doesn't, does he have an app for it?
[14:11.440 --> 14:17.040]  Oh, that's scary. I need to download the app. Yeah. Look at him, he's all grumpy. Andrew, your celebrity
[14:17.040 --> 14:24.720]  game of features is fantastic. This is a great game for everyone. We'll do more. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I
[14:24.720 --> 14:32.880]  was a fan of it. I liked it. How do you feel now, Gavin? Do you feel better? Oh, yeah. Do I? Very
[14:32.880 --> 14:38.180]  good. Look at that. That was the goal. That's what I was hoping for. Great game. How's everybody else
[14:38.180 --> 14:44.780]  doing? You guys saw Twisters. You gave me some money. Jesus Christ. Why do you all hate Twisters?
[14:45.060 --> 14:49.480]  There were some people I know who said Twisters was like fun. It was good. No, they didn't. Yeah.
[14:49.920 --> 14:55.280]  Are they people that you respect? Not anymore. Yeah. A thing was a giant spinning piece of turd.
[14:55.520 --> 15:01.640]  Well, what, one is my wife. She liked that movie? Yeah. Can you believe that? Oh my lord. Did she
[15:01.640 --> 15:06.120]  like the original? Yeah. She loves the original. Yeah. There's no way you can love the original
[15:06.120 --> 15:14.260]  and then love that. What I said. It was so offensively bad in so many ways. I can't believe
[15:14.260 --> 15:22.700]  that there's no kiss. There's no physical touch in that movie. It's crazy. Their best friend,
[15:22.920 --> 15:29.680]  who's the guy from the Jim Beam commercials, joins the military, is in for five years and
[15:29.680 --> 15:38.920]  leaves with government prototype satellite imaging technology that he gets to keep. I was also in
[15:38.920 --> 15:46.320]  the army for exactly five years. I got a blanket. I got to keep a blanket and some old clothes.
[15:46.520 --> 15:54.040]  That is such fucking bullshit. I don't see what your inability to get stuff has to do with him.
[15:54.040 --> 16:00.500]  That sounds like a you problem. The CG is now at a point where you can make weather look flawless,
[16:00.740 --> 16:05.140]  like it can be as realistic as you want. And I don't know how it looked worse than the original.
[16:05.600 --> 16:12.320]  I feel the same way. Also, the whole idea that we're going to take pictures of it from the outside
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.920]  and that's going to be better than the thing we did in the last movie where we just put a thousand
[16:16.920 --> 16:22.880]  balls inside it and map the entirety of the fucking thing. Like the premise from the get-go was like,
[16:22.880 --> 16:25.980]  that's stupid. They already did this better in the first movie. That's not an improvement.
[16:26.300 --> 16:30.780]  We're going to bullet time it like it's the matrix. It only referenced the original movie
[16:30.780 --> 16:39.620]  by negating all of their work. Yes, correct. My knock on it isn't even the like, here's what was
[16:39.620 --> 16:44.260]  presented. Isn't this a bad movie? It's a summer blockbuster and I'm not trying to hold out much
[16:44.260 --> 16:50.800]  hope for it being spectacular or really even competent. But the fact that there are so many
[16:50.800 --> 16:57.500]  missing parts in it and it's missing... the thing you remember from Twister is the cow flying and
[16:57.500 --> 17:04.860]  them tying to the pole, like the pipes or whatever. Nobody leaves the ground in this movie.
[17:07.240 --> 17:13.820]  Well, her boyfriend does at the beginning. Yeah, it's just people. At the very beginning it happens
[17:13.820 --> 17:19.160]  and then the rest of the movie is spent inside of cars and everyone's racing to get to a Twister
[17:19.160 --> 17:25.600]  first for whatever reason. My problem with it is that there's no memorable action through like
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.480]  the whole thing. And also I've talked ad nauseum about with Gavin and Jeff about this. The fact
[17:31.480 --> 17:36.980]  that there's no dog in this movie is like fucking insane. I mean, they weren't looking for one. It's crazy.
[17:37.200 --> 17:44.820]  It's crazy that there's not a dog that hangs out with Glenn Powell that has like a little scarf
[17:44.820 --> 17:50.980]  and then he's like buddies with the people in the Winnebago thing. That dog, Eric,
[17:52.260 --> 17:56.800]  you're not only are you right, that dog, the absence of that dog cost them 40 million dollars.
[17:57.020 --> 18:01.460]  That's a 40 million dollar dog. I think people, you could have sold a dog plush,
[18:01.760 --> 18:07.040]  people would have talked about the funny dog, it would have been great. Replace the methy drone
[18:07.040 --> 18:13.400]  pilot with a dog and let the dog fly the drone. That's 60 million right there. Give the dogs
[18:13.400 --> 18:20.500]  60 million. They just at no point could figure out the rules of their own twisters. It was so
[18:20.500 --> 18:25.420]  arbitrary at what range from the twister something would get picked up and sucked up. It was whatever
[18:25.420 --> 18:32.760]  they decided. It made absolutely no sense. So that's twisters. And when he's driving and he's
[18:32.760 --> 18:38.220]  like here's what we're doing, the scarecrow goes over here, the tin man, and he had like a pre-rendered
[18:38.220 --> 18:46.540]  visualization on his car about what was happening. Mental. Also, they spend the whole movie racing
[18:46.540 --> 18:52.200]  to get to a tornado that... winning that race doesn't matter at any point to what they're
[18:52.200 --> 18:56.800]  trying to do. They just need to get there. They're always like trying to run each other
[18:56.800 --> 18:59.760]  off the road when they're getting to the same place. You'd be like, no, we gotta get there
[18:59.760 --> 19:04.260]  first. It's like, so why? You're both getting to the same fucking place and you're not leaving
[19:04.260 --> 19:06.900]  immediately. You're going to be there for an hour until you die. You might as well,
[19:06.900 --> 19:12.700]  like there's no fucking hurry. I like to sometimes picture what would happen during the credits,
[19:12.940 --> 19:19.000]  like if the filming continued after a movie. And I think all that would happen in this one
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.680]  is that Glenn Powell would be taken away in handcuffs. So just fully committing a felony,
[19:25.820 --> 19:33.340]  I assume, right at the end there. Really, really just... I mean, Paul Scheer, great cameo
[19:33.340 --> 19:38.720]  from from Human Giant. And how did this get made and everything else? A big Paul Scheer fan.
[19:39.300 --> 19:43.700]  And he keeps telling him to move his car. And I don't know why that's him. I don't know why he's
[19:43.700 --> 19:49.820]  in that movie. Really bizarre cameo. Really? And honestly, the only cameo in like the whole movie.
[19:50.300 --> 19:53.880]  That's when you find out that like one of the producers is his brother-in-law or something.
[19:54.220 --> 19:58.840]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Asked him to be in it. And he's like, yeah, it's definitely a guy who's
[19:58.840 --> 20:02.640]  just like a fan was just like, you want to be in this? OK. His bit did make me laugh. Well,
[20:02.640 --> 20:07.900]  he's in it because his mom was right. Is that the whole thing with him? You didn't see that
[20:07.900 --> 20:13.680]  thing of like his mom was a background extra in the first one and she was pregnant with him.
[20:14.640 --> 20:19.980]  Are you serious? How would she be pregnant with him in 1994 or whatever? Yeah. What are you
[20:19.980 --> 20:25.920]  talking about? I don't listen, I just the tick tock or whatever. I don't know. Is Paul Scheer
[20:25.920 --> 20:32.620]  only 24? Hey, hey, Paul Scheer, if you're listening to this, you look awful for like 24
[20:32.620 --> 20:38.020]  years old. Yeah, you look great for any age older than that. But if you are 24, I'm sorry.

[21:47.310 --> 21:50.830]  Yeah, sure. I got a message the other day
[21:55.510 --> 22:01.110]  from 1976. He was born. I got it. I got a message. It's Paul Shearer. He's one year
[22:01.110 --> 22:05.470]  younger than me. He's 48. It was weird that his mother was pregnant when he was 20 years old.
[22:09.070 --> 22:13.150]  I got a message from a guy named Archie and he's like, hey,
[22:13.330 --> 22:18.870]  my girlfriend Kira is going to message you. She has something for the show. And I just
[22:18.870 --> 22:22.330]  as soon as she messaged me, she said, hey, Eric, and I just sent her the
[22:22.330 --> 22:24.950]  P.O. Box number. And I went like that should probably take care of this.
[22:25.330 --> 22:30.170]  And she said, actually, I have something else. I thought you'd like to meet these two guys.
[22:30.470 --> 22:36.170]  Let me send a couple of images here. Thought you'd like to meet these two guys,
[22:36.850 --> 22:40.950]  because I do agree. I think we do want to meet them. Is it Leonardo DiCaprio still?
[22:41.600 --> 22:50.430]  No. The one on the perch. And with me, I can send a picture of her as well. The one on the perch
[22:50.430 --> 22:58.770]  is Jeff. The baby with the fluffy head is Eric. I will say Jeff was very intrigued by an apple
[22:58.770 --> 23:08.710]  and it was very cute. Big fan of the podcast here. She works at a sanctuary for falcons.
[23:10.950 --> 23:19.550]  Sanctuary for falcons. And this is Jeff. Oh, that's my spirit animal. That's amazing.
[23:20.250 --> 23:26.310]  She's in Yorkshire. And this is these are actual falcons named Jeff and Eric.
[23:26.630 --> 23:29.570]  That's crazy. Jeff is beautiful.
[23:29.570 --> 23:34.170]  So there was already a Jeff and then there's a new baby and they named it Eric.
[23:35.050 --> 23:39.810]  The falcon that laid those eggs was actually in the day after tomorrow as an extra.
[23:42.170 --> 23:44.170]  It's a fun fact about that falcon.
[23:46.290 --> 23:52.150]  But there you go. Kira, thank you so much for sending in falcon news. So we are truly
[23:52.150 --> 23:56.650]  protected by falcons. I love that first picture of Jeff the falcon on a perch next to an apple
[23:56.650 --> 24:02.710]  that really embodies it. To me, to me, it really embodies the whole podcast.
[24:03.450 --> 24:08.290]  Yeah. Wow. What a majestic creature. That's beautiful.
[24:09.410 --> 24:10.410]  Isn't that crazy?
[24:10.410 --> 24:14.050]  Yeah. Didn't falcons take down the whole world
[24:14.050 --> 24:20.790]  recently? Wasn't that bug? The the what the the where the all computers blue screened
[24:20.790 --> 24:25.950]  cloud strike bug? Yeah. Isn't wasn't the update they tried to push that shut everything down
[24:25.950 --> 24:30.150]  called Falcon? Oh, yeah, it was something falcon, wasn't it?
[24:30.210 --> 24:33.670]  I think it was something falcon. I think the falcons took down all of the computers.
[24:34.110 --> 24:40.350]  The CrowdStrike falcon content update. Yeah. Annihilated by falcons. Wow. Annihilated by
[24:41.110 --> 24:44.590]  falcons. What a cool way to go out. I want to be annihilated by falcons.
[24:47.770 --> 24:52.010]  Wow. That's so cool. That's uh, but yeah, I just wanted to share that. Thank you,
[24:52.070 --> 24:56.550]  Kira, for sending us falcons named Jeff and Eric, which I think is really fantastic stuff.
[24:56.790 --> 25:01.810]  Awesome. That is awesome. If y'all don't mind, I have two to one really quick little thing that I'm
[25:02.210 --> 25:05.670]  and then a brief little story and then I'm out. I'm tapped out for the for the week.
[25:05.850 --> 25:09.550]  Tapped out. That's not true. I have a million things, but I know everybody's got stuff to talk
[25:09.550 --> 25:16.490]  about. Uh, I, I demoed this on the, on the last of us live stream yesterday. So Nick and Gavin are
[25:16.490 --> 25:21.070]  aware of it, but I landed on a new idea for a little mini segment in the podcast. You know how
[25:21.070 --> 25:25.710]  we have like Gavin's life hacks that whenever somebody keys in on one, we bring it up and we
[25:25.710 --> 25:30.790]  talk about it. Well, I was thinking about that, that subreddit on Reddit, shower thoughts and
[25:30.790 --> 25:34.750]  how you're like, you're taking a shower and then you think like, you have like a dumb incisive
[25:34.750 --> 25:37.590]  thought or whatever. I don't think you need to explain the premise of a shower thought.
[25:37.590 --> 25:41.730]  Oh, okay. Well, you know, I can never tell. Yeah. Shut up, Jeff.
[25:43.450 --> 25:51.990]  It's in the name. And, uh, I guess that's true. Well, it, this is also in the name too. I had
[25:51.990 --> 25:56.710]  an interesting thought while I was taking a dump two days ago and I decided that I would like to
[25:56.710 --> 26:01.010]  birth, uh, to the podcast and to the world shitter thoughts. That's when you're sitting on the
[26:01.010 --> 26:04.190]  toilet, playing on your phone or whatever. You got your shit and shades on cause you're looking
[26:04.190 --> 26:08.570]  real cool. And then you have like an interesting thought, right? Like for instance, I'll, I'll
[26:08.570 --> 26:12.410]  debut it with my interesting, my first shitter thought. And I assume you guys will come back
[26:12.410 --> 26:18.790]  with shitter thoughts in the future. I have one. I also have one. I use a toilet scrubber more
[26:18.790 --> 26:25.610]  times a day than I use a fork. That's insane. That can't be true. What the fuck? Yeah. I was
[26:25.610 --> 26:30.110]  thinking about it. I use a toilet scrubber three to four times a day right now since, since Detroit,
[26:30.110 --> 26:33.550]  it just hasn't stopped. But, uh, I probably only use a fork twice a day.
[26:34.030 --> 26:38.290]  Now I'm confused by this because I always assumed that your shits were just as liquid as
[26:39.110 --> 26:42.590]  shit. And I don't know why all the liquid is sticking to the bowl.
[26:43.230 --> 26:48.810]  I just, I've been having real bad explosive shits and a lot. Oh, so it's like, yeah. Oh,
[26:48.910 --> 26:53.270]  so it's like spraying up high. That's terrible. They're like a lot of them. A lot of it is
[26:53.270 --> 26:58.010]  getting, uh, like it's above the clean line, you know? Yeah. I've been having that issue.
[26:58.010 --> 27:02.290]  Yeah. But it's definitely like probably three or four times a day. I got that toilet scrubber
[27:02.290 --> 27:05.490]  on my hand that I'm like, holy shit, man. I don't use it. I don't, I don't put anything
[27:05.490 --> 27:09.750]  in my mouth this many times. You start to realize what tools are actually important to you in your
[27:09.750 --> 27:17.770]  life. In a, in a similar shit, a thought I realized yesterday that the bar I got drunk at the most
[27:17.770 --> 27:25.310]  was the off topic set. Like I've been drunk. I've been drinking in a lot of bars, but the place that
[27:25.310 --> 27:31.350]  I frequented the most to get drunk at was work. And I just thought that was pretty weird.
[27:31.970 --> 27:35.790]  That's a very funny shit or thought. That's a, thanks for sharing that Gavin. That's a great
[27:35.790 --> 27:40.190]  one. Anyway. So if anybody ever has a shit or thought, feel free to share it. Uh, the other
[27:40.190 --> 27:44.890]  thing I have is a little story I want to tell you guys of something that truly bizarre that happened
[27:44.890 --> 27:50.870]  to me. Uh, the other day I was driving home from somewhere and it was dusk and nobody was home.
[27:50.870 --> 27:55.310]  I was driving. I was going to come home to an empty house. And I, uh, I pulled up into my
[27:55.310 --> 27:59.030]  driveway and I just like, as I was getting out of the car, the breeze, it was one of those days where
[27:59.030 --> 28:03.670]  it was like somehow 80 degrees at 7pm and it was just breezy and nice. And you're like, I don't
[28:03.670 --> 28:07.510]  want to, I just didn't want to go inside. And I thought, Oh, I can go for a bike ride. And I was
[28:07.510 --> 28:10.950]  like, I don't want to pull my bike out. And I'm not sure charged enough. Cause I went already once
[28:10.950 --> 28:14.950]  today. And you know, it just seems like a hassle. So I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna walk out of my
[28:14.950 --> 28:18.930]  car and not even go into my house, just turn around and hit the sidewalk and take a left and
[28:18.930 --> 28:24.910]  go for a walk. And right as I did that, I think what would have happened is I would have got about
[28:24.910 --> 28:28.350]  five feet and realized, Oh, I don't have headphones. This is going to be a boring walk.
[28:28.430 --> 28:34.470]  I need to turn around and go get headphones. But I was distracted because like four or five steps
[28:34.470 --> 28:42.010]  in all of a sudden out of nowhere, I hear zombie by the cranberries and it like really like slow,
[28:42.150 --> 28:46.330]  like quietly. And then it gets louder and louder. And I turn around and there's a guy on a bicycle.
[28:46.330 --> 28:50.890]  Who's got like a, like a beats boom box type thing in his, in a little basket on the front.
[28:50.910 --> 28:58.210]  And it's playing blaring zombie by the cranberries, cranberries. And I'm glad I made that flip. And
[28:59.270 --> 29:05.090]  he just zips past me and keeps going down the road. And so I hear zombie really loud. And then
[29:05.090 --> 29:08.250]  it gets kind of quieter and quieter and then it disappears. And I just think it's fucking funny
[29:08.250 --> 29:13.870]  that I heard zombie out of nowhere like that. And this guy was just like, he was like a young
[29:13.870 --> 29:19.890]  dude, like about 25, just blaring it. And I, at this point I'm like blocks away and I'm thinking
[29:19.890 --> 29:23.810]  about that. So I'm not realizing that I don't have my headphones in because if I had my headphones,
[29:23.950 --> 29:28.550]  none of this happens. And so I, I go a little bit further and as I'm maybe two or three blocks down
[29:28.550 --> 29:33.230]  the road, I hear zombie again. And I look up and he's coming back at me and I'm like, and he just
[29:33.230 --> 29:36.830]  goes back by me like in reverse. And I was like, Oh, he must've dropped something off or went back
[29:36.830 --> 29:41.830]  the other way. And I was thinking, that's a long song. Like you don't realize how long that song
[29:41.830 --> 29:46.890]  must be, but that's been playing for a while. And I keep walking. And at this point, at some,
[29:47.790 --> 29:51.230]  somewhere around here, I realized that I don't have my headphones, but I'm five or six blocks
[29:51.230 --> 29:54.330]  from home at this point. And I'm already into the walk. So I'm like, ah, just, you know,
[29:54.530 --> 30:01.530]  be alone with my thoughts. And then as I'm walking to the left of me, very faintly, I hear zombie
[30:01.530 --> 30:08.150]  playing. And as I walk, it follows me. And I realized the guy's riding around the neighborhood
[30:08.150 --> 30:14.590]  still listening to zombie play, listen to zombie. And he, and he's just somewhere near me, but I
[30:14.590 --> 30:19.250]  can't tell where, and I go right to get away from it. Cause I'm like, ah, that's enough
[30:19.250 --> 30:23.790]  fucking cranberries for me. And it goes away. And then like two minutes later, I hear it again,
[30:23.890 --> 30:27.530]  but it's in a different side of me. And I'm starting, it's starting to give the effect
[30:27.530 --> 30:32.490]  that this guy's circling me while listening to the cranberries. And I'm like, surely the song
[30:32.490 --> 30:36.950]  is on repeat because it would have ended by now. And so I just start, I start to get a little
[30:36.950 --> 30:40.330]  annoyed and I start changing up the way I'm walking. So even I don't know where I'm going.
[30:40.430 --> 30:44.370]  Right. And I just try to get far and far away and I'll get away from it for a while. And then every
[30:44.370 --> 30:47.750]  once in a while I'll hear it. And then it'll get really loud. And I'm like, this motherfucker's
[30:47.750 --> 30:50.950]  right on top of me. And I'm like looking for him and I stop and I'm looking to see where he goes.
[30:51.130 --> 30:55.670]  And he never, and I never see him. He never quite comes into my view. He's always like a block
[30:55.670 --> 31:00.450]  away. And then he gets quiet again, quiet again. And it has the effect of like, when you read
[31:00.450 --> 31:04.590]  stories about how people camp, like in the Appalachians at night, and they hear a voice
[31:04.590 --> 31:09.630]  right outside their camp going, help. And then it'll like circle the camp and get close and then
[31:09.630 --> 31:13.270]  get far away. And they're trying to draw you out of the tent. And they always say like, that's the
[31:13.270 --> 31:17.750]  succubus or whatever, stay in your tent. It felt like that. It felt like I was being taunted and,
[31:17.750 --> 31:23.790]  and stalked by the cranberries. And I walked for 45 minutes and the longest it left me alone was
[31:23.790 --> 31:29.550]  about 12 minutes. The rest of the time there were the fucking cranberries were playing zombie
[31:29.550 --> 31:35.010]  somewhere in the periphery around me until like maybe the last five minutes when I got kind of
[31:35.010 --> 31:39.510]  close to home. I didn't hear it anymore, but it was the fucking freakiest thing I've ever
[31:39.510 --> 31:44.550]  experienced. And it got me thinking, have you guys ever been stalked by a song before? Because
[31:44.550 --> 31:50.790]  I got stalked for 45 fucking minutes by dead Dolores Reardon and the cranberries. And it was
[31:50.790 --> 31:59.530]  weird. I have so many questions. Um, so you never saw the guy again? I only saw him twice. I saw
[31:59.530 --> 32:03.470]  him the first time he rode by me. And then when he came back by me at the very beginning in the
[32:03.470 --> 32:07.850]  first, like 15 minutes, was there any interaction with the guy when he went by? No, no, I didn't
[32:07.850 --> 32:12.010]  make eye contact with him or anything. He wasn't looking at me. He wasn't concerned with me at all.
[32:12.090 --> 32:17.050]  He was just like riding down the road, listening to the cranberries. Do you think like the sync
[32:17.050 --> 32:22.130]  on his iPod got interrupted or something? And he only had one song or weirder than that. He
[32:22.130 --> 32:28.690]  had an iPod. I don't fucking know, but it is such a dude. I mean, if you think about it, it is such a
[32:30.290 --> 32:38.010]  move to listen to one song in public for an hour loudly, you know? And then it's also like,
[32:38.090 --> 32:45.770]  that's a statement, right? Or what kind of person only wants to listen to one song over and over and
[32:45.770 --> 32:52.050]  over again? And I am sorry. I like the cranberries. I am of that era. I saw them perform at Liberty
[32:52.050 --> 33:00.750]  lunch live in like 1997. Yeah, 1997. I consider myself a cranberries fan. That dude listened to
[33:00.750 --> 33:06.350]  that song more times in 45 minutes than I've listened to it in 30 years. There's all kinds
[33:06.350 --> 33:11.930]  of weirdness surrounding this. There was a time in the UK, I think in the 80s or something where
[33:11.930 --> 33:16.230]  one of the radio DJs lost his mind and started just playing the same song over and over again.
[33:16.570 --> 33:21.150]  Maybe that was happening. He was just on the radio. It might've been, or it's like some glitch
[33:21.150 --> 33:27.190]  in the matrix, but it was fucking weird. And now, and had I had my headphones, I never would've
[33:27.190 --> 33:30.050]  heard it. I never would've noticed it. I would've just been listening to music or a podcast, you
[33:30.050 --> 33:35.450]  know? And it was only because he, it was, that's the weird thing too. It's only because he lulled
[33:35.450 --> 33:39.550]  me far enough away from my house with the cranberries, where I realized I was too far to
[33:39.550 --> 33:45.250]  turn around and go back to get my headphones that I even like, he created this scenario that then
[33:45.250 --> 33:56.070]  I was trapped in really bizarre. Who has heard one song more often Mick Jagger or like a 15 year
[33:56.070 --> 34:02.450]  ice cream truck driver? Oh, ice cream truck driver. You think, you think so? I'm trying to
[34:02.450 --> 34:08.010]  think of like a long lasting band that would, that's like played hits for a very long amount
[34:08.010 --> 34:14.010]  of time up against a profession in which you hear one song over and over again, because it's seasonal,
[34:14.010 --> 34:23.090]  right? I mean, is anyone an ice cream man for their entire life? Somebody has to have been.
[34:23.950 --> 34:30.310]  Family business. When I was a kid in Alabama, the ice cream truck would come by the house all the
[34:30.310 --> 34:35.910]  time. And my grandma would never let me go because she said that the ice cream man sold drugs. And so
[34:35.910 --> 34:40.870]  the ice cream truck was something I saw on TV and out my window, but I didn't experience
[34:40.870 --> 34:44.050]  for a couple of years. Oh man, it was rough.
[34:46.790 --> 34:48.830]  And I didn't get, I didn't get ice cream or drugs.
[34:51.430 --> 34:59.470]  How disappointing. What a waste. That's a really weird thing, Jeff. Yeah, it's just a weird
[34:59.470 --> 35:02.770]  fucking story. I know it's just like so many things I wouldn't have done. Like normally I
[35:02.770 --> 35:06.050]  would have had my bike. Normally I would have had headphones. Even if I'd gone for a walk,
[35:06.050 --> 35:10.790]  I would have had headphones. It was just something about the time of day and it'd be in magic hour
[35:10.790 --> 35:15.230]  and nobody being home. And, and then it was just like, it was just so weird. And I just kept
[35:15.230 --> 35:20.090]  thinking like, how could this guy still be listening to this song? Like, how is it physically possible
[35:20.090 --> 35:24.190]  that he's only... The volume is changing? No, he's just like, listen, he's blaring it. Like
[35:24.190 --> 35:27.870]  it sounded like on... No, but for you. Oh yeah. And the volume is changing because he's getting
[35:27.870 --> 35:31.230]  further and further away. And I just like, it was just so weird where I thought like,
[35:31.290 --> 35:33.750]  all right, I'm not going to hear it anymore. Surely I won't hear it anymore. And you're like,
[35:33.930 --> 35:37.290]  all right, is he fucking with me? Is he, am I imagining it? Am I, am I, do you try to convince
[35:37.290 --> 35:40.530]  yourself that you're imagining it? And then you're like, no, no, I'm definitely, it's loud.
[35:40.530 --> 35:44.210]  I'm definitely hearing it. You know, it's like, it was just... Were you definitely making progress
[35:44.210 --> 35:48.210]  throughout the walk or could it have been a time loop? No, I was making progress. I was just
[35:48.210 --> 35:52.490]  walking through my neighborhood. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I've got no answers for that. Yeah. It's
[35:52.490 --> 35:57.890]  weird. I, it was just that guy and I, the real answer is that guy and I were just synced up,
[35:58.030 --> 36:01.610]  you know, like he was just going for an evening bike ride and I was going for an evening walk
[36:01.610 --> 36:08.030]  and we just were crossing paths a lot. And he is, you know, mentally ill and only knows one song.
[36:08.810 --> 36:12.990]  What's really funny about that is to him, this is an odd story, which I think is great. There's
[36:12.990 --> 36:18.590]  another half to this that is so unmemorable. He will not tell anybody. For him, he was just out
[36:18.590 --> 36:23.630]  on a bike ride. This only, even though we were both there, this only happened to one of us. Yeah.
[36:24.930 --> 36:27.990]  This is not a shared experience in any way. No, not at all.
[36:27.990 --> 36:32.770]  That's funny. What were you going to say, Gavin? Sorry. I don't know.
[36:38.390 --> 36:43.810]  I assumed you were going to pivot topics. Just real, real quick. And then you guys can pivot
[36:43.810 --> 36:48.170]  topics. The entire time Jeff was telling that story, I was watching the last three outs of
[36:48.170 --> 36:54.570]  the Padres game where we just threw our second no hitter ever. So I'm, I'm listening to Jeff
[36:54.570 --> 36:59.610]  tell this story about being stalked by a song and I have my headphones on, I'm watching a screen
[36:59.610 --> 37:04.970]  and I'm pacing around the room. Just go fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh my God.
[37:05.350 --> 37:11.310]  That was crazy. Who threw it? Uh, Dylan Cease. He's the second Padre to ever do it. Yeah. Huge.
[37:11.430 --> 37:16.150]  The last time was 2021. Nuts. I think I have a Dylan Cease RPA actually. That's cool. Yeah. He
[37:16.150 --> 37:21.390]  was a White Sox for a long time. Yeah. So, but now Gavin, why don't you take us away with your
[37:21.390 --> 37:27.170]  next fun story? How do happy endings work? Okay. What do you mean? Like, and Andrew, why don't you
[37:27.170 --> 37:33.870]  take this away? Well, no, my, my kind of, my thing would relate to that. So let's go through Gavin's.
[37:34.050 --> 37:40.330]  What, what do you mean? Logistically or? When, I mean, I've never, I've never been to a place
[37:40.330 --> 37:46.050]  that offers it, right? That you're aware of. Um, well that's true. But do you know it's coming?
[37:46.790 --> 37:51.830]  Or like, do you ask for it at the beginning? Something's coming, yeah. You do? I mean,
[37:51.890 --> 37:56.090]  someone does. I just, I think something's coming, but I don't know how it works. Nick,
[37:56.130 --> 38:02.810]  why don't you go ahead and give us a breakdown? Uh, I think it's insane to assume. Well, I just
[38:02.810 --> 38:07.610]  think if I, if I, if I sat down, it was like, yeah, all right, you've ordered the, uh, the 90
[38:07.610 --> 38:14.730]  minute signature massage with a happy ending. I'd be like, I don't think I would enjoy any of
[38:14.730 --> 38:22.370]  the massage. I would just be waiting for the, I'd be, cause there's no clock. So I'd be like,
[38:22.610 --> 38:25.910]  if she's, if she's like turning me over or like moving on to different, I was like, oh God,
[38:25.930 --> 38:30.330]  is this the, is this the happy ending? I think the whole experience would be miserable.
[38:31.690 --> 38:36.710]  I, I hate what you've done. You've just accidentally ruined some food for me.
[38:36.710 --> 38:45.930]  That's horrendous. I've never thought about the idea of the happy ending being on the menu
[38:45.930 --> 38:55.330]  of like the stone massage with a happy ending as a side. A lot of the Japanese places in my area
[38:55.330 --> 39:03.710]  refer to their deep fried sushi rolls as happy. That is the qualifier. So like happy California
[39:03.710 --> 39:12.530]  roll, happy this roll, happy teriyaki roll, uh, happy tug job roll. Yeah. Whenever I see that on
[39:12.530 --> 39:18.290]  a menu now, I'm going to just think of cum, which is not what I want in my head when I'm going to
[39:18.290 --> 39:23.730]  have food. Yeah. I realized that, uh, I would only, I think I would only be able to enjoy it
[39:23.730 --> 39:31.030]  if it was offered at right at the end, right before it happened. Oh, well,
[39:33.030 --> 39:37.250]  this is insane. Let's throw, let's, let's say that this is on the menu.
[39:37.610 --> 39:42.850]  Let's say that this is a thing that the person has checked off that they want.
[39:43.890 --> 39:48.130]  It comes at the end, right? That's the whole point. So just know that that's the end of it.
[39:48.410 --> 39:52.430]  Why would you be stressed in that scenario? That's like saying you're stressed about eating dinner
[39:52.430 --> 39:56.330]  because you know, there's a really good dessert at the end. Yeah. It's like saying that you're
[39:56.330 --> 40:01.110]  stressed watching a movie going, this is gonna, is this the end? Is it about the end? I don't know.
[40:01.150 --> 40:04.790]  I think it'd freak me out. I would be freaked out for way different reasons. I would be
[40:04.790 --> 40:08.510]  self-conscious. I would feel like I was going to get in trouble with somebody. I would feel like
[40:08.510 --> 40:12.950]  my mom would find out. I would feel like the person doing it secretly hated it and was grossed
[40:12.950 --> 40:18.370]  out by me or was like, oh, what a disgusting wiener this loser has. I would be so self-conscious
[40:18.370 --> 40:22.290]  about me and the whole process and feel like I was doing something wrong. Even if I ordered
[40:22.290 --> 40:27.290]  it off a menu and you know what I mean? I would say, no, I'd go to the bathroom.
[40:27.350 --> 40:32.050]  Everything is above board. It's legal. Everyone's consensual. It's all good. It's on the menu.
[40:32.470 --> 40:38.210]  I would just, I don't know. I'd be like, I'm not very hungry. This here's the menu.
[40:38.290 --> 40:43.410]  In a million years, I could never do it. Yeah. I'd just be like, just the normal please.
[40:43.990 --> 40:45.330]  So you'd want it surprised.
[40:45.790 --> 40:50.070]  I'll just have a regular ending, please. Yeah. I'd have to go for the regular ending
[40:50.070 --> 40:54.530]  unless it was, unless they just, you know, sometimes you get a haircut and they just trim
[40:54.530 --> 41:02.930]  your eyebrows. No, no, I don't. You never had that? 29 years living, never had that happen.
[41:03.770 --> 41:08.270]  You're saying they trim your eyebrows? Is that what you said?
[41:08.270 --> 41:15.670]  Eyebrows. What? Yeah, my guy would just go down to the eyebrows. It happened to Gus once too.
[41:16.610 --> 41:18.950]  Well, fucking Gus needs it. It should happen to Gus more than once.
[41:20.790 --> 41:27.870]  I've never, I've never had my eyebrows trimmed. Then you ain't lived. I guess not.
[41:28.350 --> 41:35.470]  Is it, is it nice? Do you like it? No, but it's not, it's not expected.
[41:35.470 --> 41:43.470]  It just happens because, because if, if he said at the beginning, oh yeah, I'll shorten up the
[41:43.470 --> 41:45.990]  back and sides and all that. I'll give you a little bit on top and then I'll go for your
[41:45.990 --> 41:49.770]  eyebrows. I'd be like, no, don't worry about the eyebrows. But because he just does it,
[41:50.050 --> 41:56.670]  I'm just like, okay. I've, yeah. Is this something multiple barbers have done to you?
[41:56.790 --> 42:02.190]  Or is it just your current guy? Just my current guy. Interesting. Okay. But I don't think my
[42:02.190 --> 42:08.770]  eyebrows were as out of control when I didn't have this guy. Got it. It's an age thing. I got
[42:08.770 --> 42:14.710]  it. Yeah. I think it's so much worse, the scenario you're describing for the happy ending. In what
[42:14.710 --> 42:21.090]  way? I, the idea of it being a surprise makes it so much more stressful to me. How can it be
[42:21.090 --> 42:27.930]  stressful? Well, having the scenario in which you could be asked. Oh, like the plausibility
[42:27.930 --> 42:31.070]  that it could be coming and that you have to be prepared for the moment. The thing that Gavin
[42:31.070 --> 42:36.410]  is wanting in his world would be so much worse to me than it being a choice at the beginning
[42:36.410 --> 42:42.090]  that you can opt in or out of. I mean, I don't want this. Seems like. That's fine. No one's
[42:42.090 --> 42:46.790]  saying you are. I'm just you're bringing up a scenario in which it was possible in your world
[42:46.790 --> 42:52.630]  of it being a yes. You saying it was more stressful knowing it's eventually coming as
[42:52.630 --> 43:03.690]  opposed to, uh, coming later. Yeah, I think I just haven't lived a sleazy enough lifestyle to
[43:03.690 --> 43:09.210]  know anything about that kind of thing. But I am fascinated by it. You know, so do you,
[43:09.310 --> 43:14.530]  when you go into a massage place, do you say this? This isn't one of them tug job operations.
[43:15.170 --> 43:20.670]  You just come out front. No happiness here. Am I right? And then you wink at him.
[43:21.510 --> 43:27.570]  Well, I believe you're like, give me the Robert Kraft wink wink. I mean, that's not places here
[43:27.570 --> 43:31.650]  to do it, right? I assume like when I'm picturing this happen, it isn't like Thailand or something.
[43:32.050 --> 43:37.230]  No, I have no idea. I don't think any of us are an authority on this. I'd assume it's more
[43:37.230 --> 43:41.870]  widespread than you think. But once again, really not an authority on this in any way.
[43:42.130 --> 43:48.850]  I'm purely guessing. Nick says under the table. I like the idea of being creepy for like being
[43:48.850 --> 43:54.530]  creepy in the reverse way of not wanting the creepy thing. Like coming in and blatantly be
[43:54.530 --> 44:00.570]  like, as I was saying, like no tug jobs in here. Am I right? Like let's no, no tugs allowed. Like
[44:00.570 --> 44:09.570]  just, just to be clear, I'm not getting tugged off. Yes. Yeah. I would hate it if anyone just
[44:09.570 --> 44:16.930]  started jerking me off out of nowhere. Oh, it would, it would make me so mad if that happened.
[44:16.930 --> 44:23.230]  Give this less than three stars on Yelp. If there's any touching in that area.
[44:24.290 --> 44:28.150]  I would hate it if someone offered to tug off my perfectly normal and clean penis.
[44:32.930 --> 44:38.550]  Someone just like walks out of the room after getting a massage. Hey, they didn't ask to get
[44:38.550 --> 44:49.150]  tugged did they? Want to make sure. Police in this place. Oh man, this is great. And this is
[44:49.150 --> 44:52.810]  just what you think of all the time, Gavin? Is that what happens? I've given one of my shit
[44:52.810 --> 45:01.210]  thoughts. My shitter thoughts. This episode is brought to you by Indeed. When your computer

[45:26.350 --> 45:32.650]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days. Eight different settings,
[45:32.650 --> 45:40.510]  adjustable intensity, plus it's heated, and it just feels so good. Yes, a massage chair
[45:40.510 --> 45:47.210]  might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car, suddenly it seems quite practical.
[45:47.730 --> 45:53.630]  The all new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan, packed with premium features like available massaging front
[45:53.630 --> 46:00.410]  seats, it only feels extravagant. I think I had a toenail dream the other night.
[46:00.410 --> 46:06.790]  Oh, God. Fucking disgusting. I know. The other day, I, uh, I remember the other day I went to
[46:06.790 --> 46:11.390]  cut my toenails and I was like, oh, I need to cut my toenails and my, my, my, specifically my big
[46:11.390 --> 46:16.730]  toe on my right foot. And I went to cut it and it didn't need to be cut, but I distinctly remembered
[46:16.730 --> 46:21.410]  like my toe and my shoe and bugging me and then touching it and going like, oh, I need to cut my
[46:21.410 --> 46:25.890]  toenail. My toenail's too big, but that must have never happened because my toenail didn't need to
[46:25.890 --> 46:31.690]  be cut. So did I have a dream that I needed to cut my toenails? And if so, is that where I am in
[46:31.690 --> 46:36.270]  life where I can't tell the difference? My dreams are so boring. I can't tell the difference if
[46:36.270 --> 46:44.290]  they're real or not because they're that mundane. Maybe, maybe you're just living like your dream
[46:44.290 --> 46:50.110]  lifestyle and you can't imagine anything better than this. I don't know, but I definitely didn't
[46:50.110 --> 46:54.410]  need to cut my toenail, but I definitely remembered needing to cut my toenail. So it must have been a
[46:54.410 --> 46:59.830]  dream. I had a terrible dream the other night in a hotel where I was once again, just dreaming
[46:59.830 --> 47:03.850]  through my eyes. Like I was dreaming about the room. I was dreaming about me just lying in bed
[47:04.250 --> 47:09.330]  and I was like, oh, I'm doing this just boring dream thing again. And I could figure it out
[47:09.330 --> 47:12.410]  because I looked at the time and I couldn't read the time. I was like, oh, I'm dreaming again.
[47:12.930 --> 47:18.430]  And then suddenly, uh, Meg walked into the hotel room and, uh, I just turned over and didn't listen
[47:18.430 --> 47:21.850]  to her. Cause I was like, I don't want to, I don't want to talk to the dream version. I want
[47:21.850 --> 47:25.890]  the real version. This dream version of Meg isn't real. That's what you dream about? You dream about
[47:25.890 --> 47:33.710]  ignoring Meg? Why? Ignoring the dream her. I wanted the real her, not the fake one. I don't want my
[47:33.710 --> 47:42.650]  mind's version of her. I didn't even, I didn't even let her get a word out. She came in to tell
[47:42.650 --> 47:48.630]  me something and I just turned over. It was so important to you probably. What do you think the
[47:48.630 --> 47:57.810]  happiest time is in a 24 hour clock? 5.01 PM. 5.01? Yeah. It's got, it's got to be somewhere
[47:57.810 --> 48:04.190]  right around that. Yeah. Right as soon as work's over. Yeah. Cause we have cool jobs, but from
[48:04.190 --> 48:10.210]  like, for most of my life, 5.01 PM. You're right. Yeah. Like the minute work ends is typically
[48:10.210 --> 48:17.030]  my best. The greatest minute of the week is 5.01 PM on Friday. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[48:17.030 --> 48:22.490]  Especially if you're already done and you see that clock, you've been, you've, you fucking
[48:22.490 --> 48:26.790]  ducked out two hours ago and you look at the clock and you see 5.01 and you go, I made it out.
[48:27.030 --> 48:34.090]  I escaped two hours early. I'm getting off a shitty job. I just cheated two hours out of life.
[48:34.410 --> 48:40.230]  Yeah. It's the best. Oh, I feel so good right now. Just the fucking best feeling when you just work
[48:40.230 --> 48:47.010]  a dog shit job and you go, Oh, I got away with it. And now I'm done for a couple of days.
[48:47.010 --> 48:52.530]  And this is the exact moment when is, when it's the largest amount of time between now and I got
[48:52.530 --> 48:58.330]  to do it again. That is it. Maybe every Friday when we're streaming on Twitch, we should celebrate
[48:58.330 --> 49:04.070]  5.01. No, we can't because it's, it's not, it's not the same. This is, I enjoy this work. I enjoy
[49:04.070 --> 49:10.090]  this job. Yeah, we're lucky. No, we're celebrating it for everyone else. We're like, we're like,
[49:10.190 --> 49:16.770]  we're like raising a glass to the working man. We're like, we're giving it up to everyone who
[49:16.770 --> 49:21.570]  had to listen to their boss all week. We're saying, hell yeah, dude, you're done. We're a
[49:21.570 --> 49:28.330]  Coors commercial. Oh yeah. Okay. I support that. Here's to you, Mr. 5pm man. Can I add a cherry
[49:28.330 --> 49:32.530]  to this experience? That's, I'm excited. I'm just thinking about this. Oh yeah, add the cherry.
[49:33.250 --> 49:38.790]  It's a three day weekend. It's a long weekend. It's a Friday going into a three day. Oh,
[49:39.310 --> 49:44.710]  better. There was one cool thing that they did in the army that I got to give them credit for
[49:44.710 --> 49:48.490]  that I always thought was so bad-ass. There was a rule when I was at four. Yeah. Well,
[49:48.510 --> 49:51.610]  there's two cool things they did in the army that I got to give them credit for. One is obviously
[49:51.610 --> 49:56.210]  nukes. The second one is there was a policy when I was at Fort hood. I don't know if it was army
[49:56.210 --> 50:02.690]  wide, but it was when I was there that every three day weekend was a four day weekend. And so if you
[50:02.690 --> 50:08.930]  got Friday or Monday off, they gave you the other day off too. That's amazing. Yeah. That's awesome.
[50:09.130 --> 50:14.670]  It was so fucking cool. That should be worldwide like that. There's no reason we should only be
[50:14.670 --> 50:19.530]  working four days anyway. But like, dude, every three day weekend should be a four day weekend.
[50:19.650 --> 50:25.510]  You should tell your boss to go fuck himself. And then that rocks. It is amazing how far that goes
[50:25.510 --> 50:30.670]  to like you will put up with a lot of being at PT at six a.m. when you know there's a four day
[50:30.670 --> 50:34.630]  weekend coming up two weeks from now or three weeks from now. It's fucking that's like it's
[50:34.630 --> 50:40.510]  like gold in your hand, man. Absolutely. Fuck. Andrew, what job did you have when you were
[50:40.510 --> 50:46.230]  excited to clock off at 5.01? I was working a warehouse. Oh, the one where you're the only
[50:46.230 --> 50:51.410]  person in an electrical warehouse that I had to. Oh, yeah. It's exhausting. Your packaging.
[50:51.830 --> 50:57.390]  Was it a tiring job or were you constantly looking at the clock? Oh, physically. So exhausting.
[50:57.970 --> 51:03.490]  So tiring. It was I only ended up working there for like three months, but I would wake up at
[51:03.490 --> 51:11.450]  5.00 a.m., get there by six, and then as soon as I left, I would play games for like two hours
[51:11.450 --> 51:17.990]  and then I'd fall asleep at 8.00 p.m. every day. Yeah. Just zero. I had zero life outside of the
[51:17.990 --> 51:23.610]  weekend. It was just, yeah, draining. Yeah. There are a lot of jobs out there that prevent
[51:23.610 --> 51:31.770]  regular living. Yes. I'm just I can see now I have specific memory of don't stop believing
[51:31.770 --> 51:39.570]  was playing on the radio in the warehouse, walking out on a Friday. Long weekend. Oh,
[51:39.990 --> 51:45.730]  great feeling. Great feeling. Did you ever work jobs where on your last day people would
[51:45.730 --> 51:52.830]  beat the shit out of you? What the fuck? Yeah, Nick, you ever do that?
[51:55.410 --> 52:01.530]  I know this story. And no, we did shit kind of like that in the army, but not really. No.
[52:02.510 --> 52:08.850]  Explain what happened at the supermarket. I worked at Waitrose on the on the last day of
[52:08.850 --> 52:16.350]  everyone's job. They would just get like rotten food and shit thrown in. What are you talking
[52:16.350 --> 52:23.350]  about? And on my last day, I tried to sneak out before it happened. So I like tried to leave
[52:23.350 --> 52:27.750]  like 20 minutes early and people got ahead of me. They were one step ahead of me the whole time.
[52:27.750 --> 52:36.190]  I got picked up and thrown in one of the skips and then pelted with fish guts. Oh, God. And eggs.
[52:36.570 --> 52:42.850]  And they told them they do that to everybody. It's not just you. That's the lie they told you? I did
[52:42.850 --> 52:52.290]  see it happen to other people. Oh, my God. Oh, man, that's brutal. Yeah, that didn't happen to me.
[52:54.110 --> 52:57.570]  They like to do like tough guy shit in the army, but not like that.
[52:58.670 --> 53:05.870]  That's funny. Speaking of good feelings, I played Sea of Thieves the other night.
[53:07.370 --> 53:13.010]  And I had another moment where I was trying to wrap up because it's the end of a season
[53:13.010 --> 53:21.230]  and I wanted a specific thing in their battle pass and is is a little I need to like two levels
[53:21.230 --> 53:25.730]  in a night, essentially. So I was trying to maximize it. And there are these specific forts
[53:25.730 --> 53:29.410]  that give a lot of loot. It's the same thing I think I talked about last time I talked about
[53:29.410 --> 53:33.670]  Sea of Thieves. And so I went to one because I figured I'd be able to get a good chunk of XP.
[53:34.110 --> 53:38.910]  And there was a boat there already. And I looked at him from a distance from my telescope and it
[53:38.910 --> 53:44.850]  was like, this is who's captaining it. And they're like, faction is leave me alone. And I thought,
[53:44.910 --> 53:48.930]  that's great. I don't they don't want to be fucked with. I don't want to fuck with anybody.
[53:49.430 --> 53:53.970]  I'm just trying to get some XP. Let's make an alliance. Let's be friends. We can share this.
[53:53.970 --> 53:58.790]  So I was like very clear, communicating in game like, hey, friendly, friendly, let's truce
[53:58.790 --> 54:04.430]  alliance. And they immediately started shooting me with cannonballs. And so I moved on. But they
[54:04.430 --> 54:08.850]  followed me and I was like, I'm going to give this one last try. I'm going to be just painfully
[54:08.850 --> 54:15.530]  obvious that I am friendly. And so I do it again and they start heading towards me. I drop anchor.
[54:15.690 --> 54:21.470]  I raise my sails. I'm not a threat and I'm playing music and they decide to sink me anyway.
[54:21.470 --> 54:26.090]  And I have nothing. I have nothing in my boat. There's no reason for them to do this.
[54:26.390 --> 54:32.370]  So I decide I'm going to try to fuck with them, try to get revenge. And so I respawn. I end up
[54:32.370 --> 54:38.490]  on an island with a rowboat and I just I see that skull in the sky and I'm rowboating as hard as I
[54:38.490 --> 54:43.010]  can. And I know last time I had one of these type of things happen. Gavin, you brought up, did I
[54:43.010 --> 54:47.410]  have footage of it? I started recording at this point. I have some clips of the stuff before
[54:47.410 --> 54:52.430]  I started recording. I'm rowboating. I get pretty close, but I don't want to get too close because
[54:52.430 --> 54:57.590]  I don't want them to know that there's a rowboat. So I get out and I swim and I see they're fighting
[54:57.590 --> 55:02.110]  the final boss for it, which is like this is perfect. They're going to be so distracted.
[55:02.570 --> 55:09.470]  I sneak up on their boat. The problem is their ship is painted completely black and I am dressed
[55:09.470 --> 55:16.290]  in brown to like blend in in wood. And I start panicking. So I run into the bottom and I go
[55:16.290 --> 55:22.490]  through their clothing chests and I put on as many black pieces of clothing as I can to stuff
[55:22.490 --> 55:26.790]  up. But I'm like freaking out because it's like, oh, they're going to die and respawn and see me.
[55:26.830 --> 55:33.710]  Oh, fuck. So I'm rushing. I get all my black clothes on. I lay down in my hiding spot and I
[55:33.710 --> 55:40.630]  have a perfect view of everything. It is great. I'm just watching. I get credit for beating the
[55:40.630 --> 55:46.650]  fort. I get that XP I was looking for. And like last time, my plan is I'm just going to wait
[55:47.030 --> 55:51.410]  until they have that gunpowder keg that will blow up their whole ship, and then I'm going to light
[55:51.410 --> 55:55.870]  it on fire. We're just going to wait. And this is what these fuckers get. We could have all shared
[55:55.870 --> 56:00.290]  the loot. It could have been all good, but they had to be assholes. So now nobody's going to get
[56:00.290 --> 56:05.230]  any of the treasure. And so I'm just laying there and they're stacking. They're going back and forth.
[56:05.250 --> 56:08.990]  They're grabbing the loot. They're putting it in a position to harpoon it, to make it easier.
[56:08.990 --> 56:14.390]  And they're going back and forth. And then all of a sudden they start like telescoping
[56:15.250 --> 56:18.890]  constantly. And I'm like, are they looking for me? Like they knew that they fought me.
[56:19.110 --> 56:24.190]  This is kind of weird. And they're looking at my general area. So now I'm getting paranoid of like,
[56:24.370 --> 56:28.410]  do they see me on the boat? Because they're really good. They're very accurate. So it's
[56:28.410 --> 56:33.830]  like they've clearly played a lot. And I don't know what's going on. So I start scanning. I see
[56:33.830 --> 56:37.710]  I can't see the robot in the distance. I feel pretty good. I think they would attack me if I
[56:37.710 --> 56:43.350]  was there. So they're just being cautious. I chalk it up to them being paranoid. And I'm just
[56:43.350 --> 56:48.110]  kind of hanging out. And then one of them runs and starts swimming on their ship and they get
[56:48.110 --> 56:51.990]  into the ship and they're like getting ready to raise anchor and all that to move to get the loot.
[56:52.410 --> 56:58.350]  And then a second sloop comes by. But there's no reaction by them. They're in game chat,
[56:58.370 --> 57:04.150]  so I can hear them whenever they're around and talking. So they're moving their ship. And then
[57:04.150 --> 57:08.410]  the second sloop and I'm like, these motherfuckers, how are they? Do they like know each other and
[57:08.410 --> 57:12.810]  they're on the same server? What's going on? And then all of a sudden I hear in the distance,
[57:13.350 --> 57:20.470]  there's somebody on our boat. It was it was not them. The guy on the boat was a third party
[57:20.470 --> 57:26.650]  that was also, I guess, camping the scenario out, but didn't know that I was on the boat already.
[57:27.370 --> 57:34.930]  So they start trying to steal the boat and going away. They a bomb goes off on the ship. It like
[57:34.930 --> 57:40.750]  explode. I don't know if a cannon hits us or what, but I get launched off the ship with the guy that
[57:40.750 --> 57:48.490]  was trying to hijack it. I swim away. The hijacker snipes at me thinking I'm one of them has no clue
[57:48.490 --> 57:55.270]  that I'm just a third party that is observing this. I run and I hide. They kill the guy that
[57:55.270 --> 58:00.210]  was hijacking. The other boat goes away and I can hear them on comms the whole time being like,
[58:00.550 --> 58:05.630]  even if they would have got us, we buried the treasure that we cared most about. So we're fine.
[58:05.910 --> 58:11.750]  Let's dig this up. Let's get out of here. And I'm just watching them with a little gun powder
[58:11.750 --> 58:17.810]  barrel in my hand. And the guy's like, fuck that. Let's just leave. Let's go. And the guy said, no,
[58:17.890 --> 58:22.970]  we are not leaving without this. If you leave without this, I'm swimming it to the outpost
[58:22.970 --> 58:28.770]  myself. We are not going without this thing. So he digs it up and he brings it in. And I could
[58:28.770 --> 58:32.870]  just hear them talking while I'm getting closer of my gunpowder barrel of them being like, OK,
[58:33.150 --> 58:38.090]  now let's go. Now we can leave. And I swam underneath their boat. I let go of the gunpowder
[58:38.090 --> 58:42.130]  barrel and it floats up and it hits the bottom. And their boat must have been filled with
[58:42.130 --> 58:49.310]  explosives like 90 percent of my health goes away and just flames launch out the boat.
[58:49.310 --> 58:55.150]  It immediately sinks and I can just hear him yelling at his friend. I told you we should have
[58:55.150 --> 59:02.150]  left. I told you. And then they're dead. It sinks. I go on their boat, watch it happens,
[59:02.330 --> 59:07.490]  leave, go back to the island. Now the original ship that was fucking with them slowly comes back
[59:07.490 --> 59:13.350]  and is like, what is happening? Why is all of the treasure in the water? They sunk. What happened?
[59:14.410 --> 59:19.150]  And I run around the island looking for another gunpowder. There is unfortunately none. So I can't
[59:19.150 --> 59:23.870]  really fuck with them. I bury a few things of treasure and then I run out and I just start
[59:23.870 --> 59:28.310]  jumping on the beach and they gun me down. And so I think the random third party that did nothing
[59:28.310 --> 59:33.870]  ended up with all the treasure. But it is such a good feeling in that game to be like, hey,
[59:33.870 --> 59:37.330]  let's be friends. Let's get all this loot together and then be like, no, fuck you.
[59:37.670 --> 59:43.170]  And then the ruin it for those people. Oh, so good. It just reminds me of like a bank heist
[59:43.170 --> 59:47.130]  where people slowly break it in and then another crew comes crashing through the ceiling.
[59:47.130 --> 59:52.310]  Yeah, it was. I was so confused when I heard they're on our ship and I was like, oh, fuck,
[59:52.330 --> 59:57.290]  he knows I'm here. And then realizing, oh, wait, the guy on the boat that's controlling it isn't
[59:57.290 --> 01:00:03.290]  part of the crew. This is another guy on related ship. It was insane. And I recorded all of it.
[01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:08.110]  So I don't know if we want to like clip it or do something. Yeah, but absolutely. Maybe you
[01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:13.730]  may be at the end of the video or the episode. Yeah, whatever works. But that is cool if we
[01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:18.370]  had it playing under as Andrew's talking about it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. If it lines up,
[01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:22.610]  we could do that. Yeah. Yeah, that would be really great. And I mean, I'm sure we could
[01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:25.510]  make it work, but that'd be a cool little piece of supplemental content, too, that you could put
[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:30.250]  on social. That reminds me, we really got to get back and play that game, though. I feel that game
[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:34.890]  is perfect for videos. We played it once. I don't think that video has even come out yet.
[01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:40.210]  That was close to around the time that might have been recorded before the end of the company. Even
[01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:44.510]  it was so long ago. I think it was because I think me and Nick were on old Xboxes.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:48.890]  Yeah. I just want to play more. I want to play different games and identify which ones
[01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:55.770]  Eric argues with Nick. Yeah. Like Pico Park, they were arguing so much. I didn't know
[01:00:55.770 --> 01:01:01.430]  what they were even arguing about. At one point, Eric was like, you have to make a Tetris,
[01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.750]  a Tetris. You got to make a Tetris. And Nick was like, what are you talking about?
[01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:08.210]  Yeah. You have to eliminate the lines. So Tetris is I was right. And you have to do...
[01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:13.710]  That's not what Tetris is. It's eliminating the lines. Block a four. That's what it is.
[01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:17.130]  Well, we had to do it. What do you mean a block of four? You had to do it twice. Four is Tetris
[01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:22.170]  is four. Four is the grits that you eliminate. So yeah, we had to get ten. So we had to do it twice
[01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:25.950]  and then two more. So we had to get Tetrises. You just had to get ten total. Hey, did you guys see
[01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:32.730]  that guy that got the sunburn? Yeah. We talked about that already. Did we? I don't think we
[01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:36.630]  did. Did we? We did. What? Oh, maybe we talked about it off camera. Yeah, I think we talked
[01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:42.550]  about it off camera. First off, don't fuck around with sunburns. You'll get cancer. Wear
[01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:48.890]  sunscreen. But secondly, oh my God, that's very funny. And thirdly, it's like the ultimate fuck
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:53.950]  face because that's not a podcast anymore. Yeah, that doesn't exist. No, that's still who we are
[01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:59.090]  at our core. That's true. It is. That's the most amazing thing. Oh, it was in Key West? Yeah,
[01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:05.570]  he went and walked in front of the camera. The resolution of the camera isn't great. It looks
[01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:17.010]  like Fiacmo. That's my favorite podcast. That looks closer to the busted hat than it does to
[01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:25.490]  our actual logo. That's a very, very funny thing to do. But seriously, wear sunscreen.
[01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:32.570]  I'm excited about... I don't want anybody getting skin cancer and blaming us. No,
[01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:40.090]  absolutely not. The new update that came out today in Sea of Thieves added a super boat that is like
[01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:44.730]  anybody on the map can take it, but it's originally controlled by A.I. and it's the most powerful ship
[01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:49.490]  in the game. The idea being that, like, you take it and then you just ride around and fuck up other
[01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:54.470]  crews with it. I think it'll be a lot of fun. Have you attempted yet? No. And literally the
[01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:58.270]  update came out today and we've been busy all morning. So yeah, we haven't had a chance.
[01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:05.010]  Excited to play it, though. Hey, can I ask you guys a question? I've been getting up pretty early
[01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.610]  these days. Something about the way the light hits the new house. I've been waking up naturally
[01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:13.350]  like 630 in the morning. So I've been watching a ton of local news with my coffee in the morning
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.770]  and I don't really have a preference on which channel, so I bounce around.
[01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:24.810]  Why in 2024 are all traffic and weather cams 240p?
[01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:35.010]  It is 20 fucking 24. Like, can we do some sort of a fund to get GoPros for all the local news
[01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:43.130]  stations in America? The shittiest cameras on earth are still in use at our news channels.
[01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:47.430]  I mean, at this point, everyone watching has better equipment than that. Why don't they just
[01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:51.890]  rent out? Like, I'll point my camera at the weather. I don't give a shit. Use me.
[01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.990]  Pay me five bucks a day and I'll film the weather for you.
[01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.850]  No kidding. I can. Yeah, I can set up a camera on a stick to shoot the traffic.
[01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:06.190]  No problem. 1080p immediately. Promise. I'll do 8K traffic.
[01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:12.910]  Can we do... Gavin, can I pay you $5 to shoot the weather and can we make the weather channel,
[01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:18.650]  which isn't about giving temperatures, but it's just a viewing of what the current weather is?
[01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:23.890]  I have to be pretty local. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I want to do the weather
[01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:31.330]  channel, but it's not like helpful. It's just weather. It's just the sun. It's just wind.
[01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:38.810]  Just the sun. That actually is probably a bad channel. Just the sun. All sun, all the time.
[01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.790]  You flip to it and it's just a camera pointed directly at the sun.
[01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:46.930]  Look through the viewfinder, get your retina burned off.
[01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:54.570]  Okay, never mind. We can scrap the weather channel. Hey, I had an idea for a new
[01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:59.130]  draft we could do the other day that I thought you guys might like. It would be probably a
[01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:05.910]  Patreon only one because it'd be chock full of licensed stuff. But what if we did a draft of
[01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:12.170]  news flubs? Oh, well, what about just a flub draft? Looks like a flub draft. Yeah. In my
[01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:16.450]  head, it's always like a news stations, but like, yeah, what if we just did a flub draft?
[01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:21.230]  Oh, I love that. I think that could be a lot of fun. I think it'd be fun to do research for.
[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:24.670]  Maybe we can record that at the same time as the one we didn't do last time.
[01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:30.870]  Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. I really want us to do a best summer things draft. I think
[01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:39.170]  summer activities, wasn't it? Yeah. Oh, right. Do it before summer is over. Exactly. Yeah. Let's
[01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:46.990]  line that up soon. Let's end this podcast so we can line that up soon. Okay. I'm doing Eric's job.
[01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:52.030]  He's watching another Padres game. We didn't have to get. No, no. I already said we should wrap this
[01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.750]  one up. I'm trying to let you guys get to it. I didn't see it. I'm sorry. It was between. Oh,
[01:05:56.750 --> 01:06:03.130]  interesting. Well, you know what? Hey, Andrew, apology barely accepted. Oh, I see it here too.
[01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:07.170]  He said that he did. He said we should wrap this up. It was buried under the photo. Hard to see.
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:11.270]  Yeah. Sandwiched between the red line and the photo. Yeah. That's why the apology was barely
[01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:18.250]  accepted. But accepted. The fact that it's barely accepted is really irrelevant. As long as it's
[01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:23.310]  accepted is all that's required for the apology. We just needed 10 lines. We didn't need two
[01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:30.370]  Tetrises and two lines. Just any 10 would have done. Yeah. What about 60 laps? Two Tetrises and
[01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:33.870]  then two more and then we were done. Easy as that. Guys, thank you so much for listening.

[01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:58.110]  all of the videos that we've recorded and haven't put out yet? Well, I imagine they can't. They
[01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:03.910]  don't know about them, do they? Right. Yeah. So I'm asking if they can imagine them. Oh, yeah. I just
[01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:09.470]  want to say, speaking of fun Falcon activities, you missed this month's because we did it on Monday
[01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:17.610]  of when this recorded, doing a draft, building a Sloppy Joes card for a Sloppy Joes stream on
[01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:24.510]  Thursday, I believe tomorrow. Yeah. When you hear this, is that right? When is the Sloppy
[01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:29.810]  Joes stream for next week? Everybody's waiting. I'm looking at the calendar. Hold on. Maybe it's
[01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:34.710]  not on our calendar because we had to wait for Gavin. So you're announcing it before we landed
[01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:39.430]  on when we were going to do it because we had to wait for Gavin. You ran on Monday? Uh, sure.
[01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:47.190]  You ran on Thursday? Yep. Nailed it. There we go. Could we not do Friday?
[01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:52.570]  Whatever. I don't care. I thought it was Thursday. I mean, you're the one that said it. You obviously
[01:07:52.570 --> 01:08:01.130]  care. Let's do Friday. What time are we doing it at? Friday's better. What about 5.01 Hawaii time?
[01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:09.410]  Oh, my God. Slop o'clock's 11.15. So what does that mean? It would be 10.15 our time. Oh, okay.
[01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:13.290]  So why would we do it Hawaii time? I was just trying to think of somewhere it would be five
[01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:21.450]  o'clock. Maybe we'll do it at like 9 p.m. our time, Friday night? Yeah. August 2nd?
[01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:27.110]  I love it. Sounds good. Sounds good to me. And we got it locked in. See how that worked?
[01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:32.950]  We'll see you there. Fantastic. Good work by me. So tune in. Sloppy Joe's Bingo. It's going down,
[01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:41.210]  baby. On our Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye.
