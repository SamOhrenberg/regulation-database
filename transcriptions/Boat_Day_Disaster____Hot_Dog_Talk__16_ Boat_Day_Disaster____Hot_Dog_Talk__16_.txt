[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  A massage chair can look extravagant.
[00:04.080 --> 00:06.760]  Eight different configurations. Adjustable intensity.
[00:07.040 --> 00:10.860]  And it's heated. And it feels so good.
[00:11.580 --> 00:14.240]  Yes, a massage chair can look extravagant.
[00:14.440 --> 00:15.900]  And two, well, even more.
[00:16.300 --> 00:18.540]  But when those massage chairs come with a car,
[00:19.820 --> 00:21.920]  they become quite practical.
[00:22.300 --> 00:25.660]  The new Volkswagen Teguan 2025 with premium features,
[00:25.800 --> 00:27.840]  like the front seats with massage available,
[00:27.840 --> 00:33.000]  Hello and welcome to another regulation podcast.
[00:33.240 --> 00:35.100]  This is episode 16. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:35.240 --> 00:36.900]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free,
[00:37.020 --> 00:38.700]  Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[00:39.240 --> 00:39.580]  Hello.
[00:40.020 --> 00:40.420]  Hello.
[00:41.020 --> 00:42.380]  I heard that there was a boat.
[00:43.920 --> 00:45.000]  That was a boat day.
[00:45.620 --> 00:46.660]  What happened on the boat?
[00:47.080 --> 00:48.140]  You want to get straight into the boat?
[00:48.600 --> 00:49.660]  Well, we can.
[00:51.020 --> 00:52.880]  You remember the old curse of
[00:52.880 --> 00:54.800]  when Jeff and Gavin would hang out, it would rain?
[00:55.380 --> 00:57.040]  Of course. Classic.
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.000]  May have made an appearance again.
[01:00.220 --> 01:02.280]  I've got footage.
[01:03.480 --> 01:04.020]  Really?
[01:05.300 --> 01:05.860]  Yeah.
[01:06.760 --> 01:07.920]  Do you want to see the footage?
[01:08.480 --> 01:08.940]  Please.
[01:09.420 --> 01:12.480]  I'd love to say that last year's boat day in August
[01:12.480 --> 01:13.140]  looked like this.
[01:13.940 --> 01:16.760]  And this year's looked pretty similar at the beginning.
[01:17.700 --> 01:19.480]  But towards the end...
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.480]  Let me go live.
[01:21.460 --> 01:22.480]  Gavin is live.
[01:22.900 --> 01:23.920]  Can you see it?
[01:23.920 --> 01:25.580]  Looks like you're at a pier.
[01:26.860 --> 01:28.600]  There's a boat.
[01:29.500 --> 01:31.620]  This is after we got off the boat.
[01:32.240 --> 01:33.440]  Jesus Christ.
[01:35.740 --> 01:37.440]  It's raining heavily.
[01:46.660 --> 01:48.180]  I'm trying to do commentary.
[01:48.340 --> 01:49.380]  It's raining.
[01:49.980 --> 01:51.160]  It is raining.
[01:51.160 --> 01:51.220]  It's raining.
[01:54.140 --> 01:55.820]  There's a lot happening right now.
[01:56.160 --> 01:57.380]  The bridge is out.
[01:59.380 --> 02:00.460]  Don't worry.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.960]  They're going to fix the bridge, Andrew.
[02:03.560 --> 02:06.160]  What you're seeing is
[02:06.160 --> 02:08.560]  a guy with nipple rings and a backhoe
[02:08.560 --> 02:10.060]  trying to reconnect the dock
[02:10.060 --> 02:12.360]  that got disconnected in a storm.
[02:12.360 --> 02:13.540]  Look around at yourself.
[02:19.880 --> 02:21.920]  They tried to...
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.000]  Doesn't this look like it should be on the news?
[02:26.260 --> 02:26.860]  Yes.
[02:30.100 --> 02:31.700]  There are people
[02:32.280 --> 02:34.440]  escorting other people into the water
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.860]  to get to another dock.
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.960]  With their belongings over their head
[02:37.960 --> 02:40.140]  and kids held high, it looked
[02:40.140 --> 02:42.420]  like we were surviving a natural disaster.
[02:42.540 --> 02:46.480]  We were surviving a natural oopsie.
[02:47.540 --> 02:48.740]  In the last
[02:48.740 --> 02:50.240]  half hour of being on the boat,
[02:50.440 --> 02:52.300]  it was killer all day.
[02:52.460 --> 02:54.480]  Upper 90s, the water was great.
[02:55.340 --> 02:56.440]  Everything was really nice.
[02:56.580 --> 02:58.820]  In the last half hour, we kind of watched
[02:59.440 --> 03:00.840]  all of the
[03:02.480 --> 03:04.080]  dark, dark clouds roll in
[03:04.080 --> 03:06.640]  and we started seeing lightning in the distance.
[03:07.240 --> 03:08.080]  Our captain's like,
[03:08.080 --> 03:10.380]  we can reset where the boat's gonna be
[03:10.380 --> 03:11.960]  but I gotta get everyone out of the water
[03:12.380 --> 03:14.500]  right now. And we're like, let's just go back to the dock.
[03:14.660 --> 03:15.800]  Because we're done. Whatever.
[03:16.120 --> 03:17.760]  He was like, we're probably fine.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.900]  We can stay out here longer if y'all want.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.120]  And we were like, you know what, we're good.
[03:21.420 --> 03:23.860]  We'd been out there for three out of our four hours.
[03:24.180 --> 03:25.640]  Three and a half hours, just about.
[03:25.740 --> 03:26.940]  So we're like, let's just go back to the dock.
[03:28.600 --> 03:30.220]  It looked like we were
[03:30.220 --> 03:31.760]  in a movie where
[03:31.760 --> 03:33.820]  a natural disaster was about to happen
[03:33.820 --> 03:36.380]  to the boat in front of us and then to us
[03:36.380 --> 03:38.340]  so the main character knows that there
[03:38.340 --> 03:39.880]  is danger and the stakes are high.
[03:40.480 --> 03:42.420]  It was so fucking crazy
[03:42.420 --> 03:44.320]  watching the rain catch up
[03:44.320 --> 03:46.300]  to us. Yeah, it was like someone
[03:46.300 --> 03:47.920]  was turning down the draw distance.
[03:48.320 --> 03:49.860]  It was like a wall of mist.
[03:50.540 --> 03:52.540]  It was like a black wall of
[03:52.540 --> 03:54.360]  rain and it was
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.160]  coming, let's say we were moving
[03:56.160 --> 03:58.240]  at like 30 miles an hour on the boat
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.720]  it was going 55.
[04:00.340 --> 04:02.460]  Yes. We got back to the dock
[04:02.460 --> 04:04.360]  the boat started getting bumped around
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.500]  we run into the dock, all this stuff, whatever
[04:06.500 --> 04:08.540]  we get off the boat, we grab all of our
[04:08.540 --> 04:10.320]  stuff, we start racing
[04:10.320 --> 04:12.460]  from the boat because it starts raining
[04:12.460 --> 04:14.520]  like on us and we're like, oh that's
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.520]  fine, we're getting a little bit wet, whatever.
[04:17.180 --> 04:18.300]  It starts raining
[04:18.300 --> 04:20.420]  so fucking big it was like getting hit
[04:20.420 --> 04:22.260]  by slugs falling
[04:22.260 --> 04:24.360]  out of the air. It was absolutely crazy.
[04:24.420 --> 04:26.000]  Yeah, really like sharp slugs.
[04:26.260 --> 04:27.720]  Then there was hail
[04:28.840 --> 04:30.400]  and also while we were
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.400]  still on the boat when we were out running
[04:32.400 --> 04:34.100]  most of the people were just like facing forward
[04:34.100 --> 04:36.400]  talking and laughing, I was like glued to the
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.200]  weather because it looked like a horror movie
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.320]  I could see it catching up with us
[04:40.320 --> 04:42.340]  and I was like, we're not going to make it. And we didn't
[04:42.340 --> 04:43.960]  it caught us right as we hit the
[04:43.960 --> 04:46.440]  basically we got off the boat as it started
[04:46.440 --> 04:47.360]  raining, which was great
[04:48.920 --> 04:50.520]  but at some point we looked
[04:50.520 --> 04:52.360]  up, we were making jokes about how like, oh I hope there's
[04:52.360 --> 04:54.340]  no twisters and we looked up and there was a fucking
[04:55.020 --> 04:56.360]  like, I know it wasn't a real
[04:56.360 --> 04:58.280]  twister, but there was a funnel
[04:58.280 --> 05:00.320]  cloud forming and we were like, holy shit that's
[05:00.320 --> 05:02.300]  really happening. And the guy was like, there's
[05:02.300 --> 05:03.920]  another one over there! And it was like
[05:04.500 --> 05:06.320]  twisters, it was funny because
[05:06.320 --> 05:08.280]  they just kind of looked like it for, I don't know, what do you
[05:08.280 --> 05:10.160]  guys think, maybe 45 seconds and then disappeared?
[05:10.420 --> 05:12.280]  But it was briefly scary
[05:12.720 --> 05:14.280]  and kind of like, this isn't really
[05:14.280 --> 05:16.300]  happening, right? So we're
[05:16.300 --> 05:18.160]  running along the dock, getting
[05:18.160 --> 05:20.340]  pelted by the wind
[05:20.340 --> 05:22.440]  rain and hail. We're under a roof
[05:22.440 --> 05:24.320]  the whole time as well. All that rain that's
[05:24.320 --> 05:26.700]  in us is coming in completely horizontally.
[05:27.240 --> 05:28.400]  Yeah, we make
[05:28.400 --> 05:30.580]  it to where you leave
[05:30.580 --> 05:32.420]  and people start coming back towards
[05:32.420 --> 05:34.340]  us. And we're like, what the fuck is
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.740]  going on? The bridge
[05:36.740 --> 05:38.240]  is out. And
[05:39.100 --> 05:40.420]  the bridge isn't
[05:40.420 --> 05:42.440]  like, big or anything, you kind of see it
[05:42.440 --> 05:44.180]  in Gavin's video, but
[05:44.180 --> 05:46.400]  we have to use it to get on to
[05:46.400 --> 05:48.320]  land. It connects all the docks to the
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.280]  car park. A guy, I mean, these
[05:50.280 --> 05:52.340]  these fucking...
[05:52.340 --> 05:54.380]  Dude. They live there?
[05:54.860 --> 05:56.100]  River people?
[05:56.100 --> 05:58.300]  These two dudes that work
[05:58.300 --> 06:00.400]  there who are almost twins.
[06:00.940 --> 06:02.240]  They're these older dudes
[06:02.240 --> 06:04.280]  who are like, leathery tan
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.240]  with like, sun tattoos
[06:06.820 --> 06:08.220]  and both of them
[06:09.320 --> 06:09.840]  look
[06:09.840 --> 06:12.380]  like Joe Exotic. I shit you not.
[06:12.600 --> 06:14.120]  Like, they would enter a
[06:14.120 --> 06:16.340]  Joe Exotic lookalike
[06:16.340 --> 06:18.280]  contest to try to win free beer. And they
[06:18.280 --> 06:19.880]  both had both nipple rings.
[06:20.140 --> 06:21.600]  And they're like, we got it.
[06:21.880 --> 06:24.020]  And one of the guys just crawls into the water
[06:24.020 --> 06:25.940]  and then the other guy goes off for the backhoe
[06:25.940 --> 06:28.120]  like Eric's saying. But they were like, the craziest
[06:28.120 --> 06:30.040]  characters. And they weren't twins
[06:30.040 --> 06:32.180]  they were just two dudes who had the same look
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.260]  and the same vibe.
[06:34.420 --> 06:36.060]  So, instead of
[06:36.060 --> 06:38.100]  hooking up the bridge, which had
[06:38.100 --> 06:40.080]  a rope that was going to snap, fly
[06:40.080 --> 06:41.880]  back and cut our heads off
[06:42.420 --> 06:44.280]  instead of tying it to
[06:44.280 --> 06:46.180]  the giant tractor that he had
[06:46.180 --> 06:48.120]  he attached it to the arm
[06:48.120 --> 06:50.080]  of the big tractor to see
[06:50.080 --> 06:51.800]  if he could pull it
[06:52.240 --> 06:54.060]  I guess, using the arm
[06:54.060 --> 06:55.680]  instead of just towing it
[06:55.680 --> 06:57.860]  and I was there with these
[06:57.860 --> 06:59.900]  day labor dudes, like construction guys
[07:00.580 --> 07:01.740]  and we were just kind of like talking
[07:01.740 --> 07:03.860]  shit. And they were like, these
[07:03.860 --> 07:05.620]  guys are fucking up.
[07:05.780 --> 07:07.840]  And I'm like, oh yeah? And he was like, oh
[07:07.840 --> 07:10.100]  yeah, this isn't going to fucking work.
[07:10.640 --> 07:11.860]  And he's like, you know, we're just
[07:11.860 --> 07:13.900]  going to get in the water and help people across. This shit's not going to
[07:13.900 --> 07:15.340]  work. And that's what they did.
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.760]  They jumped in the water and they had to help
[07:17.760 --> 07:19.820]  us across, except Gavin and
[07:19.820 --> 07:21.740]  Meg have already made it across, so
[07:21.740 --> 07:23.720]  Gavin is just watching us laughing
[07:23.720 --> 07:25.800]  and filming us. Yeah, well, I
[07:25.800 --> 07:27.740]  thought this is going to take forever because they were
[07:27.740 --> 07:29.700]  talking about moving the thing into place and
[07:29.700 --> 07:31.520]  pulling the bridge, but you could just swim it.
[07:31.660 --> 07:33.500]  Yeah, and it's not even like swim, it's like
[07:33.500 --> 07:35.840]  it's chest high. It's like not crazy.
[07:36.300 --> 07:37.960]  The downside is that you have to like plop down
[07:37.960 --> 07:39.720]  off the dock onto a bunch of rocks, so
[07:39.720 --> 07:41.920]  it was pretty painful. It was
[07:41.920 --> 07:43.080]  so cold.
[07:44.240 --> 07:45.820]  Everybody had their bags and shit
[07:45.820 --> 07:46.400]  too, you know.
[07:46.400 --> 07:48.480]  I will say
[07:48.480 --> 07:50.320]  it was a bit like...
[07:50.320 --> 07:52.260]  I had a blast. I was
[07:52.260 --> 07:54.340]  having fun. I would have stayed on that in
[07:54.340 --> 07:56.440]  the rain for another 20 minutes, watching them try to fix
[07:56.440 --> 07:58.320]  it. It was trucks in real life
[07:58.320 --> 08:00.120]  and it was how trucks goes.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.720]  You and Batdog and
[08:02.140 --> 08:03.440]  Antonio roll up to the thing and you go,
[08:03.700 --> 08:06.480]  well, how are we going to fix this? And you're like, well, I'd go at it this way
[08:06.480 --> 08:08.420]  and you're like, nah, I think we should try this. That's never
[08:08.420 --> 08:10.380]  going to work. And that's what... it was just a
[08:10.380 --> 08:12.560]  bunch of country motherfucking
[08:12.560 --> 08:13.420]  Texas dudes going,
[08:14.380 --> 08:15.300]  that ain't going to work.
[08:15.480 --> 08:16.280]  I wouldn't do that.
[08:17.840 --> 08:19.360]  That dude don't know how to drive a
[08:19.360 --> 08:20.520]  fucking backhoe to save his life.
[08:20.960 --> 08:23.200]  And they were just under their breath
[08:23.200 --> 08:25.480]  doing how they would fix it and it felt
[08:25.480 --> 08:27.460]  so much like trucks. I could have stayed
[08:27.460 --> 08:29.440]  there all day watching them try to fix that bridge.
[08:29.780 --> 08:31.280]  It was amazing.
[08:31.560 --> 08:33.440]  It was so fun, but they made us all
[08:33.440 --> 08:35.320]  clear the area when they were trying to pull
[08:35.320 --> 08:37.500]  the thing. You had to go back towards the beginning
[08:37.500 --> 08:39.280]  of the bridge and I had to get up the
[08:39.280 --> 08:41.540]  bank. So I was just
[08:42.960 --> 08:43.660]  zooming in
[08:43.660 --> 08:45.660]  on everyone stood on the bridge and then eventually
[08:45.660 --> 08:47.500]  they gave up and we all went back down and
[08:47.500 --> 08:49.240]  helped everyone in their bags across.
[08:49.360 --> 08:51.600]  Which took 10 seconds. It took no time at all to
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.400]  do that. It was just a thing where people
[08:53.400 --> 08:55.420]  they're like, it's people who just got off
[08:55.420 --> 08:57.180]  boats going, I don't want to get wet.
[08:57.380 --> 08:59.320]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[09:01.140 --> 09:02.640]  It was very cold.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.840]  We were freezing, like
[09:04.840 --> 09:07.120]  jumping in that water and then with like the wind
[09:07.120 --> 09:08.460]  blowing, it was really cold.
[09:08.460 --> 09:10.440]  We got home
[09:10.960 --> 09:12.640]  it rained the whole way
[09:12.640 --> 09:14.520]  home. We got home. It was 72
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.080]  degrees. I was like fucking floored.
[09:16.180 --> 09:18.380]  I'm shivering
[09:18.380 --> 09:20.200]  cold. It's 72 degrees.
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.700]  Take a shower, put on like
[09:22.700 --> 09:24.740]  a hoodie and shorts
[09:24.740 --> 09:25.760]  and I'm like, man, at least
[09:26.620 --> 09:28.380]  I'm gonna be nice and warm. I walked
[09:28.380 --> 09:29.640]  outside, it was 97.
[09:30.300 --> 09:33.020]  It was a beautiful day for the rest of the day.
[09:33.720 --> 09:34.820]  It was crazy.
[09:35.140 --> 09:36.580]  I gotta say, I don't
[09:36.580 --> 09:38.540]  know that we've done justice, just to
[09:38.540 --> 09:40.860]  the walk from the boat
[09:40.860 --> 09:42.600]  to where the bridge was
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.280]  out is like, there
[09:44.280 --> 09:46.640]  are five docks. We were on the fourth or the
[09:46.640 --> 09:48.460]  fifth dock. It's a long, long
[09:48.460 --> 09:50.400]  walk. And it's like, they were saying like the
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.360]  rain and the wind are coming in sideways
[09:52.360 --> 09:54.180]  and it's slippery as all hell.
[09:54.380 --> 09:56.600]  And you're just like holding bags and
[09:56.600 --> 09:58.580]  trying to move forward and not fall
[09:58.580 --> 10:00.600]  off your ass and hit the concrete or go in the water.
[10:00.720 --> 10:02.340]  It was calamitous.
[10:02.580 --> 10:04.420]  That whole journey. It took
[10:05.240 --> 10:06.580]  four times as long to get
[10:06.580 --> 10:08.600]  from the boat to where the bridge
[10:08.600 --> 10:10.540]  was out as it normally would. It was just nuts.
[10:10.900 --> 10:12.300]  The rain was painful too.
[10:12.400 --> 10:14.560]  It's like big needle slugs. It hurt.
[10:14.840 --> 10:16.080]  It fucking hurt.
[10:16.340 --> 10:18.460]  And it was crazy because an hour
[10:18.460 --> 10:20.560]  before that, we were just splashing around
[10:20.560 --> 10:22.680]  in the water. It's a hot day. Everything was fine
[10:22.680 --> 10:24.360]  and regular and it was so to summer.
[10:24.540 --> 10:26.500]  So we were just like crushing cans
[10:26.500 --> 10:28.520]  of like polar seltzer. It was fucking
[10:28.520 --> 10:30.440]  awesome. It rocked. It was a great time.
[10:30.440 --> 10:31.980]  It was a great day. How many
[10:31.980 --> 10:33.700]  years have we done that now?
[10:34.580 --> 10:35.680]  Three or four.
[10:36.520 --> 10:37.460]  Something like that.
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.900]  I love the boat. Boats always
[10:39.900 --> 10:40.500]  a great time. I love that tradition.
[10:41.060 --> 10:43.320]  Love the boat. It was just like
[10:43.980 --> 10:45.740]  we just experienced all weather
[10:45.740 --> 10:47.420]  within like 35 minutes.
[10:48.160 --> 10:48.700]  We did.
[10:49.560 --> 10:52.040]  I've never just experienced that much weather in my life.
[10:52.440 --> 10:53.120]  It was crazy.
[10:53.580 --> 10:56.000]  I was like 20%
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.240]  scared of getting struck by lightning.
[10:58.020 --> 10:59.840]  Oh, big time. Dude, the lightning
[10:59.840 --> 11:01.600]  was like not far
[11:01.600 --> 11:03.400]  and we were in the
[11:03.400 --> 11:05.420]  water. It was
[11:05.420 --> 11:07.740]  bad. It was bad. Are you safe on a boat
[11:07.740 --> 11:09.620]  or dangerous? Is it dangerous on a boat?
[11:10.600 --> 11:11.780]  Depends on if the boat
[11:11.780 --> 11:13.620]  has a rubber band around it, I believe.
[11:16.720 --> 11:17.580]  Neutralizes on lightning.
[11:17.880 --> 11:19.980]  I think as long as you're touching metal
[11:19.980 --> 11:20.580]  you're fine.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.620]  It was a fun boat day
[11:27.620 --> 11:29.840]  otherwise, though. It was a very good time.
[11:30.340 --> 11:31.760]  Gavin jumped off the top.
[11:33.000 --> 11:33.780]  It was fun.
[11:34.100 --> 11:34.960]  Everyone had a good time.
[11:35.780 --> 11:37.540]  Isn't that a thing with cars?
[11:37.680 --> 11:39.800]  That they're resistant to lightning because of the rubber
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.980]  and the wheels? Am I making that up?
[11:42.180 --> 11:43.660]  I mean, that's certainly what people
[11:43.660 --> 11:44.700]  told me when I was a kid.
[11:45.160 --> 11:46.480]  Yeah, I think you're safe in a car.
[11:48.540 --> 11:49.900]  It'd be interesting to like
[11:49.900 --> 11:51.700]  where the safe zones are and not
[11:51.700 --> 11:53.580]  safe zones. Because I would not
[11:53.580 --> 11:55.740]  naturally think the car would be a safe zone.
[11:55.740 --> 11:57.700]  I wonder if the boat is more
[11:57.700 --> 12:00.140]  safe than a car. I don't know.
[12:00.800 --> 12:01.620]  Does lightning
[12:01.620 --> 12:03.440]  hit water? Yeah,
[12:03.640 --> 12:05.960]  absolutely. That must look cool
[12:05.960 --> 12:07.280]  at the point of explosion.
[12:08.340 --> 12:09.460]  That's why
[12:09.460 --> 12:11.540]  if there's a lightning storm or whatever
[12:11.540 --> 12:13.220]  and you're in a resort or a pool
[12:13.560 --> 12:15.860]  they'll make everybody get out of the pool.
[12:16.420 --> 12:17.720]  Yeah. And then I just go
[12:17.720 --> 12:19.880]  to the ocean. I'm there
[12:19.880 --> 12:20.380]  for some water.
[12:21.660 --> 12:23.100]  Get some bigger sea going.
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.300]  There you go.
[12:24.620 --> 12:26.680]  It'll disperse the electricity and make you safer.
[12:26.900 --> 12:29.040]  It will. Maybe I'll turn into the blue guy
[12:29.040 --> 12:31.220]  from Watchmen. I mean, it's the worst that'll happen.
[12:31.720 --> 12:32.720]  I'm pretty okay with it.
[12:33.000 --> 12:33.920]  Would your cock be out?
[12:34.700 --> 12:36.020]  My cock's always out.
[12:37.500 --> 12:38.420]  Why wouldn't it be?
[12:40.060 --> 12:41.160]  What, you think this is
[12:41.160 --> 12:42.300]  a special event?
[12:42.940 --> 12:44.980]  Do you really have to get out of the water during lightning?
[12:45.180 --> 12:47.100]  Fish don't get out of the water and they seem fine.
[12:47.820 --> 12:48.740]  That's a great point.
[12:49.100 --> 12:51.120]  I have no argument against it. I think fish die
[12:51.120 --> 12:52.040]  from lightning strikes.
[12:53.160 --> 12:55.200]  I never met a fish that died of a lightning
[12:55.200 --> 12:57.120]  strike. I don't meet many
[12:57.120 --> 12:57.600]  fish.
[12:58.240 --> 13:00.660]  I guess we move in different circles, Eric.
[13:00.960 --> 13:03.320]  Walking out of the sea. Like, again?
[13:04.120 --> 13:05.000]  Once again?
[13:05.960 --> 13:07.440]  Three times this week.
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.320]  Every time I go
[13:09.320 --> 13:11.000]  to try to see Deadpool, Wolverine, or
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.120]  Twisters, the movies of the summer that you should definitely
[13:13.120 --> 13:15.180]  see, there's a lightning
[13:15.180 --> 13:17.180]  storm. Would you eat fish that
[13:17.180 --> 13:18.880]  was struck by lightning? Of course.
[13:18.880 --> 13:19.960]  Oh, yeah.
[13:20.220 --> 13:22.820]  I would pay a premium
[13:22.820 --> 13:24.980]  for it. That would turn me
[13:24.980 --> 13:26.520]  into the blue guy from Watchmen.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.900]  See, I think that would give me like 10%
[13:28.900 --> 13:30.880]  flash, where I'm not the flash, but I'm
[13:30.880 --> 13:31.300]  faster.
[13:32.940 --> 13:34.700]  You're like flashy. Yeah.
[13:35.080 --> 13:37.000]  Like my speed would increase, but I'm not
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.880]  like the flash. That'd be
[13:38.880 --> 13:40.920]  insane. According to the internet, if fish
[13:40.920 --> 13:42.860]  are near the surface, they can be killed by
[13:42.860 --> 13:44.920]  lightning strikes. Water, though, is a good conductor
[13:44.920 --> 13:46.900]  and tends to keep the electricity near the
[13:46.900 --> 13:48.960]  surface, so any fish in water
[13:48.960 --> 13:50.520]  that's more than two meters deep
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.900]  generally won't even feel it. So you just gotta be
[13:52.900 --> 13:55.040]  six feet down. So as long as I swim,
[13:55.720 --> 13:56.960]  as long as, yeah, you swim
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.440]  under the water, you're fine. Yeah.
[13:58.820 --> 14:00.960]  It's like an action movie whenever there's an explosion.
[14:01.320 --> 14:02.980]  Like as long as you're like one foot
[14:02.980 --> 14:04.200]  under, you're good.
[14:05.120 --> 14:06.440]  Yeah. Don't worry about it. Well, it's like
[14:06.440 --> 14:08.920]  when they shoot you, like when there's like bullets
[14:08.920 --> 14:10.980]  in like the water or whatever, right? Like that's not
[14:10.980 --> 14:13.200]  like, can't kill someone with a gun
[14:13.200 --> 14:14.940]  if they're swimming, right? Like if they're underwater?
[14:14.940 --> 14:16.880]  It's true. That's true.
[14:17.480 --> 14:19.280]  Is it? Like that's like a Mythbusters
[14:19.280 --> 14:20.800]  thing, right? Like they test it?
[14:21.300 --> 14:22.660]  Yeah, like what really slows them down.
[14:22.940 --> 14:24.840]  Turns them all around. They tumble in that.
[14:25.460 --> 14:27.200]  Slows them down, turns them all
[14:27.200 --> 14:29.020]  around? Yeah, like it shreds them.
[14:29.060 --> 14:31.280]  They just fall to pieces. They do the hokey pokey
[14:31.280 --> 14:32.580]  and you're safe from guns.
[14:32.580 --> 14:35.140]  100 bullets of... And that's
[14:35.140 --> 14:36.800]  what it's all about. Shoot one down,
[14:37.160 --> 14:37.820]  tumble around.
[14:39.020 --> 14:41.340]  That reminds me of, um...
[14:41.340 --> 14:42.380]  Oh, what was the movie called?
[14:43.280 --> 14:44.580]  It would be such a great
[14:44.580 --> 14:46.380]  group watch. It is...
[14:47.160 --> 14:48.580]  Val Kilmer is in it for one
[14:48.580 --> 14:50.600]  scene. Christian Slater is in it for one
[14:50.600 --> 14:52.640]  scene. LL Cool J
[14:52.640 --> 14:53.420]  is in it.
[14:55.620 --> 14:56.560]  Fuck, what is this?
[14:57.060 --> 14:57.820]  Masterminds? Criminal?
[14:58.920 --> 15:00.600]  It is... Any of them called Andrew?
[15:01.520 --> 15:02.400]  I don't...
[15:03.320 --> 15:04.640]  There actually might be a character.
[15:05.060 --> 15:06.480]  Mindhunters? Yeah!
[15:06.900 --> 15:08.760]  Mindhunters! I love Mindhunters
[15:08.760 --> 15:10.420]  so much. And it is the ultimate...
[15:11.420 --> 15:12.500]  I need you
[15:12.500 --> 15:14.120]  guys to see this fucking...
[15:14.120 --> 15:16.600]  We really need to watch it. It's one of my
[15:16.600 --> 15:18.760]  favorite bad movies of all time.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.500]  What's going on there? It has bad
[15:20.500 --> 15:22.380]  movie font. Look at that. Everything
[15:22.380 --> 15:24.120]  about it says bad movie.
[15:24.420 --> 15:26.540]  So this is the premise of Mindhunters. They are
[15:26.540 --> 15:28.400]  their go-to... They're an FBI
[15:29.940 --> 15:30.900]  program specializing
[15:30.900 --> 15:32.240]  in dealing with serial killers
[15:32.240 --> 15:34.640]  and they're going to like the training for it
[15:34.640 --> 15:36.620]  but there's a serial killer in their mix.
[15:37.020 --> 15:38.840]  And they're exploiting their weaknesses
[15:38.840 --> 15:40.840]  against them. Taking them out one
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.900]  at a time. And it is great
[15:42.900 --> 15:44.960]  and they break away from that premise
[15:44.960 --> 15:46.960]  almost immediately. But uh
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.220]  the final fight
[15:49.220 --> 15:51.000]  and that film is two people
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.960]  underwater and they try to shoot each other
[15:52.960 --> 15:54.980]  underwater and the bullets just don't
[15:54.980 --> 15:56.860]  go. So then they both
[15:56.860 --> 15:59.180]  put their pistols above the water
[15:59.180 --> 16:00.840]  and have a hold your breath contest
[16:00.840 --> 16:02.680]  to see who will survive
[16:02.680 --> 16:04.160]  the shootout.
[16:04.840 --> 16:06.460]  It's fucking awesome.
[16:06.460 --> 16:07.780]  It's so stupid.
[16:07.980 --> 16:09.720]  I love that movie so much.
[16:09.940 --> 16:10.820]  It's great.
[16:11.560 --> 16:13.800]  So it's just two guns sticking out of the water.
[16:14.020 --> 16:16.360]  It's just two hands with pistols
[16:16.360 --> 16:18.480]  sticking out of the water, pointing in each
[16:18.480 --> 16:20.520]  other's directions. And that is how
[16:20.520 --> 16:21.580]  that film is resolved.
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.520]  Johnny Lee Miller, that's the dude from Hackers
[16:24.520 --> 16:26.080]  Yup, he's in it.
[16:26.760 --> 16:28.620]  Where is he on the poster? Is he in the background?
[16:28.800 --> 16:29.520]  He's not on the poster.
[16:30.340 --> 16:32.180]  Oh, maybe he's in the silhouetted there.
[16:33.200 --> 16:34.840]  The fact that Val Kilmer
[16:34.840 --> 16:36.760]  and Christian Slater are on the poster is hilarious
[16:36.760 --> 16:38.840]  because they probably have a combined 5
[16:38.840 --> 16:40.720]  minutes of screen time in Mindhunters.
[16:41.140 --> 16:42.640]  They are not prevalent
[16:42.640 --> 16:44.120]  in that movie at all.
[16:44.520 --> 16:46.080]  I want this to be the next movie we watch.
[16:46.280 --> 16:48.580]  It has to be in consideration. It is
[16:48.580 --> 16:50.780]  directed by a guy that
[16:50.780 --> 16:52.760]  has only made schlocky movies.
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.700]  He's my favorite bad
[16:54.700 --> 16:56.820]  film director because they're all
[16:56.820 --> 16:58.680]  fun bad. They're unbelievably
[16:58.680 --> 17:01.100]  fun bad movies. Everything he's ever done.
[17:01.700 --> 17:03.140]  He directed 12 rounds
[17:03.140 --> 17:05.060]  Oh wow!
[17:05.460 --> 17:07.320]  The John Cena Die Hard 3
[17:07.320 --> 17:09.300]  rip off. Rennie Harlan?
[17:09.460 --> 17:11.360]  Rennie Harlan is my guy.
[17:12.100 --> 17:13.600]  Mindhunters is a Rennie Harlan
[17:13.600 --> 17:15.460]  film? Dude, he produced
[17:15.460 --> 17:17.160]  Oh my god, he produced Cutthroat
[17:17.160 --> 17:18.560]  Island? Oh my god.
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.360]  He did Long
[17:21.360 --> 17:23.220]  Kiss Goodnight, didn't he? Yes, he did.
[17:23.220 --> 17:25.400]  I think so. Another fun
[17:25.400 --> 17:27.040]  bad movie. Everything
[17:27.040 --> 17:29.240]  he has made that I've seen
[17:29.240 --> 17:31.340]  is entertaining and
[17:31.340 --> 17:33.080]  just like, this is really stupid.
[17:34.300 --> 17:35.640]  What did he do?
[17:36.620 --> 17:37.640]  Driven. Die Hard 2
[17:37.640 --> 17:39.260]  Yeah, Driven. He did
[17:39.260 --> 17:41.520]  Driven. Cliffhanger Deep Blue Sea
[17:41.520 --> 17:42.340]  I think
[17:43.040 --> 17:45.040]  who was in Driven? Yeah.
[17:46.500 --> 17:47.300]  Matt Hullum
[17:47.300 --> 17:49.060]  worked on that. Oh, did he really?
[17:49.280 --> 17:51.200]  He's actually in it. He CGI'd himself
[17:51.200 --> 17:52.940]  into the movie. Oh, that's awesome.
[17:53.200 --> 17:55.140]  There's like a scene where one of the tires
[17:55.140 --> 17:57.240]  flies off a car in a crash and it
[17:57.240 --> 17:59.200]  hits people in the stands and Matt put
[17:59.200 --> 18:00.360]  himself as one of the people that gets hit.
[18:00.440 --> 18:03.100]  Oh, that's awesome. You can see him, like a young
[18:03.100 --> 18:04.680]  Matt, hold his hands up like, ah!
[18:05.300 --> 18:07.020]  That's so funny. He directed
[18:07.580 --> 18:08.660]  Die Hard 2
[18:09.200 --> 18:10.820]  which for the TV edit
[18:10.820 --> 18:12.900]  has the best line of
[18:12.900 --> 18:14.260]  yippee-ki-yay Mr. Falcon
[18:14.260 --> 18:16.740]  and then he blows up a plane. He did
[18:16.740 --> 18:19.080]  The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, which I own on DVD.
[18:19.600 --> 18:20.960]  Wow, dude. That's great.
[18:21.160 --> 18:21.460]  Cliffhanger.
[18:22.320 --> 18:24.600]  We might have to
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.000]  watch Mindhunters.
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[18:28.740 --> 18:30.020]  Might be a Falcon stream watching
[18:30.020 --> 18:32.160]  some Mindhunters, dude. Get on that Patreon
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.640]  Falcon stream, like
[18:33.640 --> 18:36.100]  we do that monthly. Every month we do
[18:36.100 --> 18:37.740]  one thing for Falcons. It might be this.
[18:38.420 --> 18:40.060]  It is, if I win the Movie
[18:40.060 --> 18:41.500]  League, it's
[18:41.500 --> 18:43.980]  a definite consideration for me, for picking
[18:43.980 --> 18:45.320]  what the movie will be that we watch.
[18:46.060 --> 18:47.960]  It's up there. It's also, I'm meaning
[18:47.960 --> 18:50.060]  to share with you guys some very exciting news
[18:50.060 --> 18:51.920]  because last time we looked at it and another
[18:51.920 --> 18:53.860]  one of these that talked about watching
[18:53.860 --> 18:56.040]  but it was not available at the time
[18:56.780 --> 18:57.940]  Blast is now
[18:57.940 --> 19:00.120]  available on streaming. You can rent
[19:00.120 --> 19:01.320]  Blast digitally. No way.
[19:01.640 --> 19:03.840]  Finally. I don't know what deal
[19:03.840 --> 19:05.540]  got passed, but the Eddie
[19:07.060 --> 19:08.260]  Griffin Breckenmayer
[19:08.260 --> 19:09.880]  action film that
[19:09.880 --> 19:11.200]  I thought was awesome
[19:11.860 --> 19:13.880]  as a child, which does
[19:13.880 --> 19:16.020]  not hold up, is available.
[19:16.600 --> 19:17.500]  We've got to do this.
[19:17.860 --> 19:20.020]  That's exciting. Those are my top
[19:20.020 --> 19:21.980]  two. That's why I want to win the Summer Movie League.
[19:21.980 --> 19:23.900]  There's going to be one that we have to watch
[19:23.900 --> 19:25.460]  and it's going to make us go, oh
[19:25.880 --> 19:27.800]  the joke doesn't, oh no
[19:27.800 --> 19:29.760]  oh, don't say that. I think it's going to be a lot of that.
[19:29.820 --> 19:31.920]  We already watched Condor, man. It surely
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.660]  can't be worse. No, it's not worse.
[19:33.780 --> 19:36.240]  The Disney children's film Condor, man.
[19:36.640 --> 19:37.580]  It surely can't be worse.
[19:38.400 --> 19:39.300]  Oh, man.
[19:39.720 --> 19:41.940]  Blast has a chance of being
[19:41.940 --> 19:43.880]  offensive. Mine Hunters is just stupid.
[19:44.480 --> 19:46.060]  We're like, the premise is
[19:46.060 --> 19:47.900]  he uses their weaknesses
[19:47.900 --> 19:50.020]  against them, but they run
[19:50.020 --> 19:51.520]  out of weaknesses really quickly.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.720]  So they just drop the premise
[19:53.720 --> 19:54.740]  of like,
[19:55.560 --> 19:58.140]  so they kill, like someone dies
[19:58.140 --> 19:59.940]  because they like sugar
[19:59.940 --> 20:02.160]  in their tea and they're like, that is his weakness.
[20:02.400 --> 20:03.420]  And it's like, that doesn't
[20:03.420 --> 20:05.780]  make sense. Or somebody else dies
[20:05.780 --> 20:07.620]  because they have a smoking thing.
[20:08.120 --> 20:09.280]  But it's, it's, uh,
[20:09.740 --> 20:11.700]  it's great. What a dumb movie.
[20:13.220 --> 20:14.280]  I can't wait for us to watch it.
[20:14.800 --> 20:16.040]  Who would you say is the best
[20:16.540 --> 20:18.100]  and pulls off the best performance
[20:18.100 --> 20:18.700]  in the film?
[20:20.800 --> 20:22.220]  Ooh, I haven't seen it
[20:22.220 --> 20:24.340]  in a while. This was a movie that I found
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.180]  on cable and
[20:26.180 --> 20:28.140]  just came in like 40 minutes
[20:28.140 --> 20:30.200]  in and I've seen it like probably four
[20:30.200 --> 20:32.440]  times on cable throughout time.
[20:32.560 --> 20:33.600]  I haven't watched it recently.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.240]  LL Cool J's fine. He gives a fine
[20:36.240 --> 20:37.260]  performance, I'd say.
[20:38.400 --> 20:40.000]  Johnny Lee Miller does the
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.080]  Johnny Lee Miller thing.
[20:41.780 --> 20:43.200]  He delivers.
[20:44.540 --> 20:45.980]  There's not like, you're not going to walk away
[20:45.980 --> 20:47.660]  from this going like, oh, that was a good performance.
[20:48.180 --> 20:49.880]  What was that Christian Slater
[20:49.880 --> 20:52.000]  movie that he did right when he went
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.120]  to jail that was
[20:55.320 --> 20:56.040]  about rain?
[20:56.880 --> 20:57.400]  You guys remember that movie?
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.900]  Hard Rain? Hard Rain, was that it?
[21:00.120 --> 21:01.440]  Heavy Rain, something like that?
[21:01.820 --> 21:04.240]  It was like a flood and there was a lot of
[21:04.240 --> 21:06.080]  robbery. Hard Rain, the Morgan Freeman movie.
[21:06.100 --> 21:07.660]  Morgan Freeman was in it, yeah. I want to see that.
[21:08.420 --> 21:10.060]  You want to see Hard Rain
[21:10.060 --> 21:11.940]  again? Yeah, why not?
[21:11.980 --> 21:13.960]  I haven't seen it since it came out. Well, he just went through it, so
[21:13.960 --> 21:15.880]  it makes sense. He wants to, like, reconnect.
[21:16.240 --> 21:18.000]  Came out in 1998. That's me. I'm just like
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.980]  Christian Slater in Hard Rain. It rained so
[21:19.980 --> 21:20.600]  hard on me.
[21:21.720 --> 21:23.140]  I remember liking it when it came out.
[21:23.340 --> 21:26.020]  I want to see it again. It is a movie that
[21:26.020 --> 21:27.640]  apparently has a really good villain death.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.700]  When we were doing that draft,
[21:30.160 --> 21:31.980]  I saw it mentioned by a few different
[21:31.980 --> 21:34.040]  websites. It's got Randy Quaid,
[21:34.160 --> 21:35.580]  Ed Asner in it?
[21:35.960 --> 21:37.920]  Fuck. Minnie Driver? Can't go
[21:37.920 --> 21:38.500]  wrong with that.
[21:39.680 --> 21:42.100]  Betty White's in it? I'm fucking sold.
[21:42.100 --> 21:44.300]  Speaking of drafts,
[21:44.300 --> 21:46.160]  y'all gotta step your game up a little bit.
[21:46.540 --> 21:48.300]  I'm a triple crown winner
[21:48.300 --> 21:50.140]  over here. Did you win the last one?
[21:50.500 --> 21:52.260]  I've won all three of the last
[21:52.260 --> 21:54.320]  drafts we've done. I'm on a three draft
[21:54.320 --> 21:55.900]  winning streak. Wow.
[21:56.360 --> 21:58.000]  And now, this is according to who?
[21:58.060 --> 22:00.020]  What do you mean? The Patreon poll.
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.180]  The official Patreon poll that
[22:02.180 --> 22:03.920]  we do. That has to be official. I have won the
[22:03.920 --> 22:05.120]  last three.
[22:06.240 --> 22:08.200]  God damn it. Wow.
[22:08.920 --> 22:09.340]  Ah, yeah.
[22:10.400 --> 22:11.580]  Nick was close.
[22:11.940 --> 22:13.440]  So you always win the drafts,
[22:13.660 --> 22:14.900]  Eric always wins the bingo.
[22:16.100 --> 22:17.520]  We have to come up
[22:17.520 --> 22:19.520]  with more games for everybody to always win.
[22:19.680 --> 22:20.860]  I need to find my game.
[22:23.100 --> 22:25.180]  Your game is good streaming advice,
[22:25.300 --> 22:27.460]  I think. You always come out on top
[22:27.460 --> 22:29.200]  of the streaming tips.
[22:31.240 --> 22:33.780]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino
[22:33.780 --> 22:35.060]  blended beverage at Starbucks.
[22:35.420 --> 22:37.400]  It's the classic blended iced coffee
[22:37.400 --> 22:39.500]  you know and love, now topped with a creamy
[22:39.500 --> 22:41.360]  layer of handcrafted brown sugar
[22:41.360 --> 22:43.460]  cold foam. Available for a limited
[22:43.460 --> 22:45.420]  time. Your Strato Frappuccino is
[22:45.420 --> 22:46.200]  ready at Starbucks.
[22:47.260 --> 22:49.180]  This episode is brought to you by
[22:49.180 --> 22:51.280]  State Farm. Checking off the boxes
[22:51.280 --> 22:53.580]  on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[22:53.980 --> 22:55.300]  And when it comes to checking off
[22:55.300 --> 22:57.380]  coverage, a State Farm agent can help
[22:57.380 --> 22:59.220]  you choose an option that's right for you.
[22:59.360 --> 23:01.120]  Whether you prefer talking in person,
[23:01.320 --> 23:03.240]  on the phone, or using the award winning
[23:03.240 --> 23:05.340]  app, it's nice knowing you have help
[23:05.340 --> 23:07.440]  finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[23:07.860 --> 23:09.400]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is
[23:09.400 --> 23:09.700]  there.
[23:12.300 --> 23:13.100]  Have you guys
[23:13.100 --> 23:14.860]  played any of the
[23:14.860 --> 23:17.340]  college football game that came out a few weeks
[23:17.340 --> 23:19.000]  ago? Mainly
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.680]  Nick, Jeff, or
[23:21.280 --> 23:23.320]  Eric. It would be crazy if you did, Gavin. If you were
[23:23.320 --> 23:24.580]  like, yeah, I can't put it down.
[23:24.860 --> 23:27.220]  Everything I read about it is people being miserable
[23:27.220 --> 23:29.520]  playing it. So I haven't bothered to touch it yet.
[23:30.040 --> 23:30.940]  What are they saying about it?
[23:31.340 --> 23:32.440]  They said it's hard.
[23:33.880 --> 23:34.520]  I think
[23:34.520 --> 23:36.540]  too realistic and that's bothering people.
[23:36.860 --> 23:38.340]  I'm sure I will. I just like,
[23:39.040 --> 23:40.520]  it's going to be one of those things where I play
[23:40.520 --> 23:41.760]  it and I go, oh, this is fucking awesome.
[23:41.980 --> 23:44.380]  I forgot that I love football games. And then
[23:44.800 --> 23:46.300]  after like one season, I'll go,
[23:46.680 --> 23:48.480]  this is the same fucking football game as the last
[23:48.480 --> 23:50.480]  25 years. I'm already bored with this.
[23:50.580 --> 23:52.160]  Why did I think I wanted to play this more than
[23:52.160 --> 23:53.980]  $10 worth? And then, you know,
[23:54.100 --> 23:56.460]  I'll just leave it. I feel that way every
[23:56.460 --> 23:58.400]  time I play a Pokemon game. I get
[23:58.400 --> 24:00.000]  an hour and I'm like, oh yeah, it's just
[24:00.620 --> 24:01.520]  it's just this shit.
[24:01.920 --> 24:04.160]  You never liked, you've never gotten into a Pokemon game?
[24:04.460 --> 24:05.960]  I liked it when I was a kid. I liked Pokemon
[24:05.960 --> 24:08.160]  Yellow. Played the shit out of it.
[24:08.180 --> 24:09.880]  But it's just, I feel like they've not added a ton.
[24:10.620 --> 24:11.420]  You gotta catch them all.
[24:12.600 --> 24:13.940]  I've never, I've actually
[24:13.940 --> 24:15.960]  never caught them all. Once you catch them all
[24:15.960 --> 24:18.060]  in the one game, why the fuck do you want to do it again
[24:18.060 --> 24:19.760]  in the next game if it's the same game?
[24:20.160 --> 24:21.620]  It's the same as football. I love,
[24:21.760 --> 24:24.060]  I love video games. I love sports video
[24:24.060 --> 24:24.580]  games, but
[24:25.660 --> 24:28.260]  they always wear down really fast
[24:28.260 --> 24:30.340]  because you just can't, football's football
[24:30.340 --> 24:32.360]  they can only make so many innovations into the gameplay
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.680]  you know? So,
[24:34.120 --> 24:36.260]  what has been different for me with college
[24:36.260 --> 24:38.380]  is as someone who doesn't
[24:38.380 --> 24:40.320]  have a college affiliation and doesn't really
[24:40.320 --> 24:42.260]  have a Canadian presence for college football
[24:42.260 --> 24:44.300]  I've always struggled to find
[24:44.300 --> 24:46.380]  an investment point, but I've
[24:46.380 --> 24:48.100]  heard from college football fans
[24:48.100 --> 24:49.900]  like the constant complaints
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.720]  of the rankings are bullshit
[24:52.220 --> 24:54.280]  and none of this works and everything
[24:54.280 --> 24:56.340]  is fucked with how it happens
[24:56.340 --> 24:58.320]  and as somebody who
[24:58.320 --> 25:00.180]  has been leading
[25:00.180 --> 25:02.260]  the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors
[25:02.260 --> 25:04.540]  let me tell you, I got issues with these votes
[25:04.540 --> 25:06.320]  I don't like the media polls
[25:06.320 --> 25:08.540]  I am undefeated in my
[25:08.540 --> 25:10.540]  season, I didn't even make the college
[25:10.540 --> 25:12.500]  football playoff in my undefeated
[25:12.500 --> 25:14.560]  season, they just bumped me at the
[25:14.560 --> 25:16.600]  last second, the rankings don't make
[25:16.600 --> 25:18.540]  sense, they're always pushing
[25:18.540 --> 25:20.500]  down the smaller schools for the big ones
[25:20.500 --> 25:22.120]  regardless of the results, like it
[25:22.120 --> 25:24.660]  in one season of playing this game
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.740]  it made me get everything that I've
[25:26.740 --> 25:29.020]  heard people complain about, and I feel like I understand
[25:29.020 --> 25:30.580]  college football now. They
[25:30.580 --> 25:32.620]  made the game the way Gavin
[25:32.620 --> 25:34.440]  wanted to make our movie draft
[25:35.200 --> 25:36.680]  where he gets all
[25:36.680 --> 25:38.320]  the money every year. I re-listened to that
[25:38.320 --> 25:40.800]  what the fuck, I re-listened to it
[25:40.800 --> 25:42.720]  today and I was just like, what were you
[25:42.720 --> 25:43.960]  thinking saying that?
[25:44.160 --> 25:46.520]  What the fuck are you talking about? I wanna
[25:46.520 --> 25:48.740]  have 128 points and I want Nick
[25:48.740 --> 25:50.820]  to have 16, is what you
[25:50.820 --> 25:51.260]  said.
[25:52.360 --> 25:53.460]  I'm doing the shit he
[25:53.460 --> 25:55.160]  picks, he's gonna have to work his way back up.
[25:58.960 --> 26:01.200]  But it, on top of that
[26:01.940 --> 26:03.160]  so I picked the Hawaiian
[26:03.160 --> 26:05.140]  Rainbow Warriors because I wanted to pick a school
[26:05.140 --> 26:07.300]  that didn't have, according to the game, a lot of
[26:07.300 --> 26:09.040]  prestige, smaller
[26:09.040 --> 26:11.160]  school, and I've been
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.020]  dominating with the running back
[26:13.020 --> 26:15.240]  on my team, and it just occurred to me
[26:15.240 --> 26:17.080]  last night that they might be a real person
[26:17.080 --> 26:19.180]  and they are, so now
[26:19.180 --> 26:21.160]  I'm all invested on Cam Barfield
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.600]  the running back for the Hawaiian Warriors
[26:24.440 --> 26:25.200]  Rainbow Warriors
[26:25.200 --> 26:27.060]  I don't know if they'll get
[26:27.060 --> 26:29.040]  drafted, I don't know if they'll have any career at all
[26:29.040 --> 26:31.200]  but because of this game I am now a
[26:31.200 --> 26:33.240]  huge athletic fan of
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.180]  that guy, and I think that's really
[26:35.180 --> 26:37.040]  cool. Can I ask a question, I think that is
[26:37.040 --> 26:39.080]  very cool by the way, can I ask a question? Of course
[26:39.080 --> 26:40.780]  Is there
[26:40.780 --> 26:43.000]  I haven't played the game so I don't know how it works but
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.920]  I assume you're playing like a franchise
[26:44.920 --> 26:47.120]  mode so you will then go into the
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.020]  offseason, deal with recruiting
[26:49.020 --> 26:51.020]  and all that stuff, and then start the next
[26:51.020 --> 26:52.840]  season. Is there a potential
[26:52.840 --> 26:55.440]  for players to leave
[26:55.440 --> 26:57.260]  via the transport portal
[26:57.260 --> 26:59.300]  without you being
[26:59.300 --> 27:00.060]  able to control it?
[27:01.080 --> 27:03.040]  Isn't that a huge danger when you're
[27:03.040 --> 27:05.040]  playing a team like, as a team like
[27:05.040 --> 27:06.060]  Hawaii to really
[27:06.060 --> 27:09.020]  have a huge breakout star on your
[27:09.020 --> 27:11.200]  tiny like, I don't know
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.100]  division three team, and
[27:13.100 --> 27:15.060]  then end up having them
[27:15.060 --> 27:16.880]  leave immediately, like punishing you by leaving
[27:16.880 --> 27:18.360]  immediately to go play for Iowa or something?
[27:18.780 --> 27:20.920]  No, you're saying that Jeff, but we're building
[27:20.920 --> 27:22.800]  a special culture here, okay, at this
[27:22.800 --> 27:25.020]  Hawaiian program. My guys are bought
[27:25.020 --> 27:26.620]  in, we're doing good.
[27:26.740 --> 27:28.520]  The only people that I've tried to transfer
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.860]  are people that are not getting the reps they
[27:30.860 --> 27:32.400]  want, which isn't too bad.
[27:32.720 --> 27:34.540]  I gotta start running back here, I'm gonna feed him
[27:34.540 --> 27:37.120]  I'm not gonna get everybody in the flow, you can leave if you want
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.180]  So you're sort of a Deion Sanders
[27:39.180 --> 27:40.660]  then? Yeah, exactly
[27:40.660 --> 27:43.180]  Yes, I'm running the hot dog
[27:43.180 --> 27:44.840]  express offense, and
[27:44.840 --> 27:47.160]  we've been cleaning up. Now are you
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.140]  just calling plays, or are you actually playing
[27:49.140 --> 27:50.840]  the game? I'm playing all the offense
[27:50.840 --> 27:53.220]  Okay, you play defense? Don't play
[27:53.220 --> 27:54.520]  defense, only play offense
[27:55.400 --> 27:57.260]  I don't know how football works
[27:57.260 --> 27:59.000]  so I don't feel comfortable playing defense
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.060]  What? You don't know how football
[28:01.060 --> 28:03.260]  works? There's like different levels
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.360]  of understanding football
[28:04.940 --> 28:07.280]  I know what they do, but I don't
[28:07.280 --> 28:09.180]  know what like a 4-3 offense is
[28:09.180 --> 28:11.220]  Oh, like you can't figure out
[28:11.220 --> 28:12.380]  like read option stuff
[28:12.380 --> 28:15.260]  I don't know the terminologies of
[28:15.260 --> 28:17.140]  like this defense means this
[28:17.140 --> 28:18.540]  and because they're in this formation
[28:18.540 --> 28:21.220]  I can process, hey that
[28:21.220 --> 28:23.360]  guy's open, I should throw the ball
[28:23.360 --> 28:25.220]  to that guy, or there's a hole
[28:25.220 --> 28:26.640]  here, run through that hole
[28:27.030 --> 28:28.660]  I get that, so I play offense
[28:29.210 --> 28:30.620]  I think that's probably most people
[28:31.220 --> 28:33.200]  I feel that is, yeah, the overwhelming
[28:33.200 --> 28:35.420]  Defense is unsexy, you know
[28:35.420 --> 28:37.200]  I feel like the first
[28:37.200 --> 28:39.180]  rule of becoming a sports fan is just
[28:39.180 --> 28:40.980]  coming to terms with you have opinions
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.420]  that are not at all informed
[28:43.040 --> 28:44.940]  and just ride that. That's
[28:44.940 --> 28:47.020]  the whole point. It's kind of the joy of it
[28:47.020 --> 28:48.260]  It is, yeah
[28:49.660 --> 28:50.940]  Be able to yell at
[28:50.940 --> 28:52.980]  insanely athletic people for
[28:52.980 --> 28:54.760]  underperforming when you have
[28:54.760 --> 28:56.480]  no ability to come even close
[28:57.180 --> 28:59.280]  Or I can bitch about how Jason Tatum
[28:59.280 --> 29:01.020]  is not getting playing time on the Olympic
[29:01.020 --> 29:03.320]  team like I know better than Steve Kerr
[29:03.320 --> 29:03.820]  Yes
[29:05.840 --> 29:06.320]  And
[29:07.020 --> 29:07.740]  Tyloo and
[29:08.340 --> 29:10.420]  Spoh and all those other coaches that are coaching
[29:10.420 --> 29:10.700]  our team
[29:10.700 --> 29:12.620]  There should be
[29:14.300 --> 29:16.080]  You know how there's like the G League
[29:16.080 --> 29:18.180]  and like high end prospect leagues
[29:18.180 --> 29:19.700]  of like a feeding system
[29:20.200 --> 29:22.240]  for like college athletes
[29:22.240 --> 29:23.440]  or whatever to come into the pros
[29:23.440 --> 29:25.980]  or like to give people experience
[29:25.980 --> 29:26.920]  before they enter the pros
[29:26.920 --> 29:28.720]  They should do that
[29:29.380 --> 29:31.940]  but it's like a beer league
[29:31.940 --> 29:34.360]  like it is guys with normal jobs
[29:34.360 --> 29:40.780]  It's a league and the most hated player for incompetence of the league gets relegated
[29:40.780 --> 29:47.600]  to that league for the next season just to display how much better they are than any
[29:47.600 --> 29:52.660]  average person who plays the game a lot. Just like the athletic difference from the worst
[29:52.660 --> 29:58.300]  player in that league. Just like to shut everyone up? Yeah, just like a bunch of guys that work
[29:58.300 --> 30:05.840]  in accounting that play hockey. It'll be like a league wide vote of who is the shittiest
[30:05.840 --> 30:10.640]  player and they have to play in the rec league to be like, no, you guys, you have no idea.
[30:10.960 --> 30:15.960]  There are levels to this game. They just push everyone to shit in. Yeah. 40 goals a game.
[30:17.880 --> 30:23.540]  That's relegation I could get behind. How's everybody doing on their Doberman count? Anybody
[30:23.540 --> 30:28.160]  catch any Dobermans lately? I haven't. You know what? I've been on top of them by
[30:28.160 --> 30:32.680]  dog count, Jeff. Haven't been keeping track of Dobermans. I forgot about that. Have you
[30:32.680 --> 30:37.840]  talked about the new Slack channel? I don't think we have. Oh, the hot dog channel? Yeah.
[30:38.680 --> 30:41.980]  Well, first off, I've seen three. I've seen three Dobermans since we last reported. Really?
[30:42.140 --> 30:45.600]  Two on the trail and one in a Whole Foods, which seemed weird to me, but I'm not going
[30:45.600 --> 30:51.960]  to tell a Doberman where he belongs. We're doing dogs. We talked about keeping track
[30:51.960 --> 30:57.020]  of dogs. So there's a Slack channel now. Whenever anybody eats a dog, just update that
[30:57.020 --> 31:03.800]  number. What's amazing is we have a dedicated hot dog Slack channel, but you had a whole
[31:03.800 --> 31:09.840]  thing last night about dogs. You made like a dog ladder, but that wasn't in the dog Slack
[31:09.840 --> 31:13.680]  channel. Yeah, because I don't I didn't want to muddy up the dog count. I wanted the dog
[31:13.680 --> 31:17.480]  count to remain as just numbers. It's not for conversation. It's just for counting. Yeah,
[31:17.520 --> 31:23.240]  I had that thought. I evaluated this is about the dogs, but you don't want to muddy up the
[31:23.240 --> 31:30.600]  dog channel. Yeah, Gavin, obviously. Come on. Jeez. You say that, Eric. Do you agree?
[31:31.080 --> 31:35.400]  What's your opinion on this? I think that I think the dog information could have been
[31:35.400 --> 31:42.460]  in there, but I'm I'm fine as long as it exists. For here are your dog pictures. So this is
[31:43.060 --> 31:49.240]  what you try. You were originally asking if there's multiple patties in a burger. One burger.
[31:49.240 --> 31:55.540]  I had a Costco hot dog and the Costco hot dog is huge. And so I was curious.
[31:56.720 --> 32:04.600]  That was perfect, Nick. That was really funny. You delivered that at the exact volume you needed to.
[32:06.340 --> 32:12.840]  It just seemed weird to me that or potentially odd that every hot dog counts the same. And so
[32:12.840 --> 32:18.400]  I looked into it and I guess the typical hot dog is like a one eighth of a pound and the Costco hot
[32:18.400 --> 32:24.000]  dog is a quarter pound dog. So I was asking because I didn't I didn't really care one way
[32:24.000 --> 32:31.180]  or another. But does the size of the dog impact how many dogs are counted? So like if the Costco
[32:31.180 --> 32:38.020]  hot dog is to a normal dog, is it two dogs or is it just one dog? Because it's a singular hot dog
[32:38.020 --> 32:44.000]  that's big. And the answer is one dog. That's like saying if you had a plate of sliders, is it
[32:44.000 --> 32:52.260]  one burger? I don't know if that's what that's like, but I don't know. If you got tiny ones,
[32:52.400 --> 32:55.720]  it's it doesn't make it. It's if you have three small ones, you have three.
[32:56.140 --> 32:59.740]  If you if it's on you, if you decide to eat a bigger than normal hot dog,
[32:59.780 --> 33:03.760]  it's still a hot dog. That's the that's phrasing behind. That makes more sense to me.
[33:05.320 --> 33:10.840]  So we're just talking about, well, what makes like what makes a burger burger?
[33:10.840 --> 33:18.960]  What makes a hot dog a hot dog? And it led to conversations about hot dog shapes,
[33:18.960 --> 33:26.880]  because the premise was that as long as it's in a bun and there's meat, no amount beyond that
[33:26.880 --> 33:32.220]  makes it an additional dog. So if you have two hot dogs and one bun, that's still one dog because
[33:32.220 --> 33:41.940]  it's packaged as one thing. And so I drew some sketches of a hand hot dog, which is a dog down
[33:41.940 --> 33:49.980]  the bun normally, and then like four dogs sticking out the side of it that you're adhesive. Yeah,
[33:50.060 --> 33:54.920]  with cheese. But no one's going to pick up one of those and think, oh, what a wonderful hot dog.
[33:55.060 --> 34:00.440]  They don't say that's one dog. That's what I'm saying. Based on this, the definition that we've
[34:00.440 --> 34:05.620]  set, that would be one hot dog. And then at that point, it looked like a ladder. Well, I would
[34:05.620 --> 34:09.800]  argue, though, that hot dogs differ from burgers because if you have two patties in one burger,
[34:09.860 --> 34:15.580]  it's a burger. If you had two dogs in the bun, you could easily call that a double dog. I think
[34:15.580 --> 34:21.280]  you would say that was two. Have you ever had that or seen someone who has done that? We talked about
[34:21.280 --> 34:27.040]  it and just went, that's insane. A double dog? Yeah. Yes. I mean, we're talking about the picture
[34:27.040 --> 34:32.720]  that he drew. Yeah. Which looks like a ladder, by the way. It's a hot dog ladder. It is a hot dog
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.420]  ladder. Yeah. And the other one looks like a... Have you ever had the mysterious two hot dogs,
[34:37.480 --> 34:44.940]  one bun? No. No, I don't think so. And that's what we were saying, is that like, weird question,
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.760]  but I don't know that it exists. So it's really just sort of... Because we're comparing something
[34:49.760 --> 34:53.640]  that definitely exists and is very common to something that potentially no one has ever had.
[34:53.640 --> 35:03.440]  But Nick asked if a corn dog is a hot dog. Yeah. No. No, it's a corn dog. Corn dog. It's a hot dog
[35:03.440 --> 35:08.960]  in a corn shell. That's not what it's called? It's called a corn dog. You keep saying corn
[35:08.960 --> 35:16.120]  shell. I don't... Corn shell is such a weird way to put it. Listen, listen. All toads are frogs,
[35:16.220 --> 35:21.580]  but not all frogs are toads. Therefore, all hot dogs... Wait, all corn dogs are hot dogs,
[35:21.580 --> 35:25.040]  but not all hot dogs are corn dogs. Did you look it up? Yeah, I looked it up. Did you see
[35:25.040 --> 35:30.940]  if all frogs are toads or whatever? Yeah. Yeah. I'm right. Gavin, what I like in this too,
[35:31.020 --> 35:37.240]  I asked him, it's like, okay, so if you think it is like, in a corn shell, when you see a turtle,
[35:37.560 --> 35:42.320]  are you just going like, oh, that's a lizard, but in like, a hard shell? Yeah, a turtle shell.
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.600]  That's a hard shell lizard. Yeah, look at that. That lizard looks fucked up. What would you call
[35:47.600 --> 35:54.980]  a corn dog in a bun? It's a corn dog. Fucked up. Fair food. Yeah. Yeah. Fair food. Fair food.
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.360]  That might be the only way I could eat a corn dog. No, I don't think I could still. It's still
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.120]  a corn dog. I couldn't eat it. Wait, you can't eat corn? What are you talking about? You can't
[36:04.120 --> 36:09.440]  eat a corn dog? You know that. It's been since the beginning of Face. I don't remember that at all.
[36:09.480 --> 36:14.620]  I swore off corn dogs for the rest of my life. I decided I'd eaten enough. Yeah. You swore off.
[36:14.620 --> 36:19.520]  Okay. I couldn't remember a bunch of corn dog updates. Yeah. I think most of the updates were,
[36:19.580 --> 36:25.840]  I still don't want one. Yeah, I've definitely had to like, turn down a couple of corn dogs
[36:25.840 --> 36:30.820]  that were pretty sexy, if I'm being honest, but. You wanted to fuck some corn dogs? Stay true to
[36:30.820 --> 36:39.060]  my ideals. I'm looking at all of the places that I can order hot dogs from in my area right now
[36:39.060 --> 36:45.800]  and what additions they have to it. Order hot dogs? What? What do you mean? I just can't,
[36:45.840 --> 36:52.300]  I don't, what places like, sell hot, like Sonic? We got a place called Big Wheel Burger.
[36:52.680 --> 36:59.020]  They got a hot dog and I'm looking at their additions right now and it's stuff you'd expect,
[36:59.140 --> 37:06.360]  like bacon, jalapeno, Monterey Jack cheese, fried onion. But you can also add a burger to the dog.
[37:06.360 --> 37:12.460]  There is no add a second dog to the hot dog, but there is an add a burger to the hot dog. But
[37:12.460 --> 37:17.280]  you're not adding it to the hot dog. Surely. Add a chicken patty to the hot dog. There's no
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.940]  add a hot dog. It's just going to come with it though. What do you mean? Are you saying it's
[37:21.940 --> 37:26.820]  going to end up in the bun or on it? Do you want me to order it right now and see what shows up?
[37:27.020 --> 37:32.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't fucking believe how much hot dogs keep coming up. I have,
[37:32.380 --> 37:37.700]  you guys don't know this because why would you? In the last week, I've recorded two entire episodes
[37:37.700 --> 37:44.880]  on So Alright about hot dogs. I had so much hot dog research and so many hot dog facts. I had to do a
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.820]  second episode. You have a podcast that could be about literally anything and you've hit hot dogs
[37:50.820 --> 37:58.040]  twice. Two weeks in a row I've hit hot dogs. Yeah. I turned one into Nick already. Were they good
[37:58.040 --> 38:06.100]  episodes? I think so. They're as good as this. I think corn dogs are deeply flawed. Yeah. Hot dogs.
[38:07.820 --> 38:13.560]  Because when you dip, are you meant to drizzle stuff on or dip them in stuff? Either. Both.
[38:14.040 --> 38:18.640]  I just feel like if I have to open my mouth really wide and I've got mustard on the end of a corn
[38:18.640 --> 38:24.900]  dog, it's just overpowering mustard all over my tongue first and I feel like that's a flaw.
[38:25.780 --> 38:30.720]  Whereas if you have it hot dog format, you don't get everything you dipped as the first thing that
[38:30.720 --> 38:36.240]  hits your mouth. Now, I just posted a picture of a hot dog that I ate and I just want to get your
[38:36.240 --> 38:43.340]  opinion on that because I get what you're saying but this is so like loaded up that I don't know
[38:43.340 --> 38:51.520]  that I tasted the hot dog at all. You know what I mean? What is that? Fritos? Sour cream? It's a
[38:51.520 --> 39:00.000]  chili cheese hot dog with Fritos, jalapenos, and sour cream. So there's chili cheese in there
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.900]  and then like all this other stuff and it's just like... Oh yeah, looks like you had a Pearl Snap
[39:05.900 --> 39:10.880]  back there too. That was Jordan. I was drinking Lone Star. Dude, Pearl Snap's such a good fucking
[39:10.880 --> 39:18.620]  beer. I went to this bar and there was a sign on the door that said, please do not let the cat
[39:18.620 --> 39:25.900]  inside. And the cat ran inside immediately and sat on the bar and kept sniffing this woman's Coors.
[39:30.180 --> 39:35.560]  It's just like, he looks so cool. That's just the bar cat. He's awesome. And they have a little
[39:35.560 --> 39:40.380]  framed picture of him right there too. How's the hot dog? Was it good? Yeah, the hot dog was
[39:40.380 --> 39:44.660]  fucking great. I had one and then I sat down. I drank like I was having a beer and eating the dog
[39:44.660 --> 39:49.820]  and then I sat there for five minutes and I went, fuck, I have to get another one. I could
[39:49.820 --> 39:56.160]  have eaten probably four or five. I was hoping... I went to Sam's Club yesterday with Emily. She had
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.760]  to pick up some stuff for her work and I thought, oh fuck, I always hear about the Costco hot dogs.
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.540]  I'm gonna try a Sam's Club hot dog. Oh, it's not the same. I wish I hadn't done that. Is there a
[40:07.540 --> 40:12.460]  Sam's Club hot dog? Yeah, it's so rare you get a bad hot dog, but when you do, it's the saddest
[40:12.460 --> 40:18.060]  fucking thing on earth. Oh no! What was it? Yeah, just an all beef hot dog like you would expect.
[40:18.180 --> 40:23.320]  Normal ass hot dog. It just was... I think it had been out for a couple of years or something. It
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.380]  just wasn't good. I don't know. It just didn't taste good. Bread tasted old. Just wasn't good.
[40:28.460 --> 40:35.840]  It wasn't anything like you'd want it to be. Yeah, it was a real bummer. Damn. We went to
[40:35.840 --> 40:41.640]  Costco the other day. I got a Costco hot dog and that was so good, but the worst thing about the
[40:41.640 --> 40:48.920]  Costco food court, that soda selection is fucking out of control. That is the dumbest fucking soda
[40:48.920 --> 40:54.780]  selection I've ever seen. It doesn't make any sense. What's on there? It's Pepsi, Diet Pepsi,
[40:56.160 --> 41:03.760]  Starry, some kind of tea, some other kind of tea. That's it. So no Coke for you. You had me at Diet
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.700]  Pepsi and Starry. Dude, I drank a Pepsi because I couldn't remember the last time I had a Pepsi.
[41:08.700 --> 41:15.160]  It tasted like doing yard work with my dad. It was like, oh no, that's why I don't drink this shit.
[41:16.460 --> 41:25.660]  It was awful. It was so sad. Yuck. Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[41:25.800 --> 41:32.840]  Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them. Picture me
[41:32.840 --> 41:36.460]  serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,

[42:21.560 --> 42:29.980]  Oh, man. Gavin, I had a thought about you yesterday that I wanted to talk to you about,
[42:30.320 --> 42:33.100]  if you don't mind. Was this before or after we spoke on the telephone?
[42:34.660 --> 42:37.060]  Did you guys speak on the phone? Did you guys talk on the phone?
[42:37.720 --> 42:46.820]  It was after. Okay. I was thinking about you in bed last night. Not like that.
[42:46.820 --> 42:57.760]  Not like that. You know that documentary about that guy who was arrested for murder in LA
[42:57.760 --> 43:04.860]  and his alibi was that he was at a Dodgers game. And then it just so happened to be an episode of
[43:04.860 --> 43:09.120]  Curb Your Enthusiasm. And so they were able to get the guy off because they filmed him.
[43:09.500 --> 43:12.280]  I was thinking about how much you've filmed in your life.
[43:12.980 --> 43:14.520]  Oh, how many alibis I've got?
[43:14.520 --> 43:23.260]  I wonder how many crimes you could solve, how many alibis, how many wrongs you could write,
[43:23.960 --> 43:32.560]  how much justice could be dispensed just based on the 10 billion hours of phone footage and,
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.980]  you know, dicking around footage you have.
[43:35.240 --> 43:38.480]  I mean, I could take maybe a year out of my life to try and watch it all,
[43:38.920 --> 43:39.800]  see what I can come up with.
[43:40.440 --> 43:47.720]  I'm sure, I guarantee you, you inadvertently caught something of significance on camera
[43:47.720 --> 43:52.720]  that's not significant to you and it'll probably never be realized, but that could have altered
[43:52.720 --> 43:56.760]  the course of something if it had been discovered. Guarantee you.
[43:57.060 --> 44:00.640]  We had it a little bit when I'd inadvertently filmed a serial number
[44:00.640 --> 44:02.680]  to something at work once that we needed. Do you remember?
[44:03.380 --> 44:08.420]  I don't. Is that something you can't talk about?
[44:08.420 --> 44:10.220]  Probably. I mean, someone went missing.
[44:10.960 --> 44:11.980]  Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.
[44:15.820 --> 44:20.780]  Yeah. I felt like I was like going through my evidence and I had some.
[44:21.680 --> 44:26.640]  Yeah. I would feel really bad because I assume I'm not going to watch a lot of this stuff until
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.760]  I'm elderly. I'll be like, I remember my youth, my past. And I'll be like,
[44:31.840 --> 44:35.780]  Oh, that guy's already been put to death. Oh shit.
[44:35.780 --> 44:37.500]  Oh no. Jesus.
[44:37.960 --> 44:39.360]  That's the kind of stuff I'm going to find probably.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.560]  Yeah, that's a shame. Oh, like he died yesterday.
[44:43.200 --> 44:47.480]  Oh, he's been dead for 20 years and I still didn't get it in time. Oh God.
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.840]  I, uh, yeah, that would be sad. Maybe don't look.
[44:51.520 --> 44:54.660]  Nick put up a poll on Twitter. Huh?
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.540]  Just now? Is a corn dog a hot dog is the poll that
[44:58.540 --> 45:01.900]  Nick just put up. Okay. And what are the standards?
[45:01.900 --> 45:08.120]  I just commented because when I went to tap on the tweet to see what happened, like,
[45:08.300 --> 45:11.940]  how are people voting? I hit yes. I voted yes.
[45:13.060 --> 45:16.020]  I meant no. So take one vote from yes and put it in no.
[45:16.120 --> 45:19.280]  All right, I'll do that at the end. When I hit no, it says sign in.
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.300]  Yeah, same. I'll never know the answer to that fucking poll because I'll never be able to log
[45:25.300 --> 45:27.100]  into Twitter again. What's it at currently?
[45:28.380 --> 45:37.600]  Uh, 57% yes, 43% no. But we have 23 hours and 53 minutes before, you know, there's time.
[45:37.800 --> 45:43.600]  Yeah, we'll find out tomorrow that I'm right. Great.
[45:45.380 --> 45:50.720]  Do you, uh, maybe it's because I just moved, but at what point in your life,
[45:50.800 --> 45:54.060]  Gav, do you think, like you were saying, you know, you assume you won't look at all that
[45:54.060 --> 45:57.260]  footage until you're elderly. There's going to be a point in your life when you just throw it away.
[45:57.520 --> 45:59.320]  How long do you think it's going to be before you do that?
[45:59.920 --> 46:01.040]  Like get rid of all the footage?
[46:01.700 --> 46:06.100]  Yeah, where you're just like, you're so far removed from it, or the technology is so old,
[46:06.200 --> 46:09.520]  it would be so annoying to even pull it up. You're just like, why the fuck?
[46:09.740 --> 46:10.160]  I'm trying to watch your VHS.
[46:10.740 --> 46:14.620]  Yeah, I'm 68 years old. I haven't thought about slow-mo guys in 28 years. Why the fuck would I
[46:14.620 --> 46:17.920]  care about? You know what I mean? Or like, after what Dan did to me, there's no way, you know?
[46:18.240 --> 46:21.920]  Hunting around for something that plays like an MOV. I'm like, oh, I remember this file type.
[46:22.060 --> 46:22.340]  Jeez.
[46:22.780 --> 46:27.140]  I was thinking about when I was moving. I have a, like, I hold on to all my cell phones for some
[46:27.140 --> 46:30.260]  instead of trading them in. And just because I always feel like there's a photo or something
[46:30.260 --> 46:33.880]  that didn't get transferred to the cloud, or there's going to be some reason I would need
[46:33.880 --> 46:37.760]  to go back to it. So I have, like, every iPhone I've ever had. And I just bring them from house
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.900]  to house. And at some point, they're going in a landfill, right? Because I wouldn't even...
[46:42.900 --> 46:48.680]  there's no way I'm ever going to pull out my iPhone 4 to pull something out or to try to
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.160]  find something. I'm just not. I think I will. You know, I go through the hassle of moving it
[46:53.160 --> 46:57.120]  and putting it in a box, but I'm not. So why don't I just get rid of it now?
[46:57.120 --> 47:02.480]  I think they'll be useful for you if you need to come up with fake alibis.
[47:03.260 --> 47:08.940]  Like, if someone's like, where were you on the evening of whatever, 2014? You can quickly
[47:09.460 --> 47:13.000]  take a picture of you holding an iPhone 4 and be like, oh, here I was.
[47:14.980 --> 47:19.880]  Bit of Photoshop on the hair and that, but pay no attention to how none of the tattoos match.
[47:20.420 --> 47:25.620]  You're wearing the same shirt that you're wearing right now. Wow, what a coincidence. 2014, huh?
[47:25.620 --> 47:28.060]  The same shirt that you're talking to the FBI.
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.840]  It's a 28 megapixel photo. Check it out. Here's me holding an iPhone 4.
[47:39.020 --> 47:44.340]  I just am suddenly very aware of everything that I own because everything that I own is in the same
[47:44.340 --> 47:47.780]  house because I got rid of storage shed and everything. And you just start to think about
[47:47.780 --> 47:52.520]  the stuff you're holding on to because you think matters. And I just did a round of
[47:52.520 --> 48:00.060]  uh, like cleaning out old documents that I had been saving. I had pay stubs that I had saved
[48:00.060 --> 48:06.480]  from when I was in journalism school in the army. Holy shit. Do you think the IRS might need them?
[48:06.900 --> 48:15.220]  Yeah, just in case. I found, I had every tax return from 1994 until this year I had saved.
[48:15.480 --> 48:20.100]  And so I had to go and like, I realized, I read, I read about you only need to save like seven
[48:20.100 --> 48:23.680]  years, but I just, I had been carrying all that stuff around for so long. Not even thinking about
[48:23.680 --> 48:29.600]  it. You know, a few years ago I realized that I was hoarding all the little baggies of extra bolts
[48:29.600 --> 48:34.920]  and like an Allen wrench for every single piece of furniture I bought. And now the first thing I do
[48:34.920 --> 48:40.560]  when I finished building furniture is throw every other thing away. Hell yes. If I, if for whatever
[48:40.560 --> 48:45.440]  reason I need it, I'm happy to try and figure it out. Find the exact thing I need on the internet
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.760]  because that to me is cheaper time-wise than dealing with mounds of Allen wrenches and
[48:52.200 --> 48:56.460]  washers and screws and shit. I don't know why I was ever thinking I would use them for.
[48:56.700 --> 49:01.540]  The fucking universe puts a new Allen wrench in your hand at least every three days.
[49:02.300 --> 49:04.140]  Yeah. It's insane. They're everywhere.
[49:04.320 --> 49:06.640]  And they're all the exact same size. So you end up like,
[49:07.420 --> 49:11.880]  Oh, I've got this bolt I need to put in. Let me try and see if my 16 Allen wrenches. Nope. Nope.
[49:11.880 --> 49:14.160]  Nope. They're all the same. They're all the wrong size.
[49:17.200 --> 49:24.000]  Yeah. Maybe every, every age that I turn the ends in a zero, I'll have a big old clear out.
[49:24.420 --> 49:30.340]  I think you should. I think it's probably good for you. You don't realize how much stuff you're
[49:30.340 --> 49:36.280]  holding onto for how long, you know? I just like, I had like all the documents from when I bought my
[49:36.280 --> 49:40.820]  first house, which is cool. I, that seems important to me. And I thought briefly, I was like, well,
[49:40.820 --> 49:46.500]  should I hold onto this as like a record? But I sold that house in, you know, whatever,
[49:47.100 --> 49:53.560]  2011 or something, 2012. Why do I need a record of owning a house from 2005 until 2012? Like,
[49:53.620 --> 49:57.180]  what is that? What purpose is that going to ever, what practical purpose could that ever serve?
[49:57.320 --> 50:01.380]  The only thing I can even come up with is like, maybe someday somebody in the future could say,
[50:01.620 --> 50:06.620]  no, you didn't. And I could go, here's the deed, you know, but who am I, who do I,
[50:06.620 --> 50:10.280]  who is that person? And why would I want to prove them wrong? You know?
[50:10.560 --> 50:13.420]  And how inconvenient would it actually be if you didn't have that?
[50:14.300 --> 50:20.900]  Yeah, exactly. I feel like the biggest change for me moving straight from a house that my parents
[50:20.900 --> 50:26.780]  lived in to a house that I owned by myself was that pretty much growing up, if I put something
[50:26.780 --> 50:30.920]  down, it would get cleared up at some point. Like if I was drinking out of a glass of water,
[50:31.320 --> 50:34.920]  I popped it down, came back to it 20 minutes later, it's already been put in the dishwasher
[50:34.920 --> 50:39.920]  or something. I'm like, oh, now it's at the point where like, I'll move into a house. I did it with
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.940]  this one and I was putting stuff in the cabinets and one of them, I needed a, I needed more space.
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.540]  So I took one of the shelves out and I just lent it against a wall in the kitchen. And then
[50:49.960 --> 50:54.300]  literally two years later, I was like, wow, that really has, I really, I should put that somewhere
[50:54.300 --> 50:59.420]  else. Like I just, I can put stuff down and then it literally doesn't move. It just gets caked
[50:59.420 --> 51:04.120]  to dust because there's no one to clear up. It's just such a weird feeling. It's a weird
[51:04.120 --> 51:08.440]  way to look at time. I'm just like, I put that down probably 700 days ago.
[51:08.740 --> 51:14.280]  And it sat there undisturbed for 700 days and would sit there for another 700 days if I didn't
[51:14.280 --> 51:19.480]  do something about it. When I moved out of the house that I was in for that, I don't know, five
[51:19.480 --> 51:24.780]  and a half years or whatever I was in, I found through the house, all these little projects that
[51:24.780 --> 51:29.240]  I had started like in a corner of my closet, like, oh, I was started to rearrange this. And then I
[51:29.240 --> 51:35.160]  just never got to it. When did I do that? And you're like, oh fuck, I did that in 2019. So I
[51:35.160 --> 51:41.580]  just ignored that little corner for four years, I guess. Wow. Yeah. I finally, I think last year
[51:41.580 --> 51:48.140]  I got rid of my last like pandemic pile of shit. I think I was, it was like a pile of stuff I made
[51:48.140 --> 51:53.360]  when I was rearranging my stuff to work from home. And I was like, oh, it's all just been there
[51:53.360 --> 51:58.020]  for years. It feels icky to me. I have to, I have to move stuff around. Otherwise I get weirded out
[51:58.020 --> 52:05.160]  by it. It's like we, uh, we did, um, this morning we played mount your friends. We did a gameplay
[52:05.160 --> 52:10.680]  in it and, uh, we played it on steam, but they recommend you play it with a controller. And I
[52:10.680 --> 52:16.300]  had had a controller hooked up to my Xbox or an Xbox controller hooked up to my PC since I was
[52:16.300 --> 52:22.300]  recording achievement hunter videos in my office at my old house. And I was having trouble with
[52:22.300 --> 52:26.540]  a connection one day and I just got mad and I unplugged the dongle and I threw it in a little
[52:26.540 --> 52:32.380]  box that was next to my desk. And it sat in that box. That would have been 2019. Maybe
[52:32.740 --> 52:38.300]  it sat in that box until yesterday when I realized, oh, I have that. And I could play on a
[52:38.300 --> 52:42.300]  controller again. And I went into my garage and I found where it was and I plugged it back in.
[52:42.580 --> 52:47.940]  Like I just had a thing that worked great that I just didn't use for four years because I just
[52:47.940 --> 52:52.120]  didn't think about it. You know, I I've never lived in a house for very long. I think the
[52:52.120 --> 52:57.160]  longest I've ever lived in the same place was maybe seven years or something. But I'm always
[52:57.160 --> 53:02.480]  fascinated by the people who grow up in a house and then they move out, get their own house,
[53:02.600 --> 53:06.700]  but then they can still go back to their childhood house if their parents didn't move. And I think
[53:06.700 --> 53:13.020]  that'd be such a half cool, but half disturbing feeling to be like, oh, that's where I took a
[53:13.020 --> 53:17.140]  shit for the first time. I always think it's weird when you like, I mean, it's kind of,
[53:17.220 --> 53:21.180]  it's kind of cool. I guess it's not weird, but it's cool because that's kind of the whole idea
[53:21.180 --> 53:26.360]  of like creating generational wealth is usually through property and passing property down.
[53:26.460 --> 53:31.120]  But I think it's weird to be like to live as a grown up and raise a family like in the house
[53:31.120 --> 53:38.360]  you were raised in. You know, like my uncle lived in my grandma's house when she moved in with my
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.780]  aunt at some point. And he was like in his fifties living in the house that he was raised in. And
[53:42.780 --> 53:47.130]  just it's cool because there's like a lineage and a familiarity there, but it also must be a
[53:47.130 --> 53:52.670]  weird and gotta be stifling in some way, I would imagine. I don't know. I bet it's cool when you're
[53:52.670 --> 53:57.510]  like, where did I put that thing? Well, instead of being like, I wonder which move I lost that during.
[54:02.290 --> 54:10.590]  So Andrew's... Andrew's busy. Andrew's dealing with his anus, I think. Yeah. He's been in a
[54:10.590 --> 54:20.270]  fight for his life for 15 minutes now. However, however, he did order the hot dog burger chicken.
[54:20.870 --> 54:25.710]  I don't know. I don't know what it means, but he's going to reveal it on the next episode.
[54:27.530 --> 54:31.430]  Nick said he didn't mute his Discord. That sounds terrible, Nick. Oh no.
[54:33.330 --> 54:37.290]  He said, I'll read it. He said, I might not make it back. My body just won't quit.
[54:39.990 --> 54:45.250]  So he said, I'll reveal the hamburger dog chicken thing next episode. If you wondered why Gavin and
[54:45.250 --> 54:48.670]  I suddenly were having an in-depth conversation just between the two of us for about 15 minutes.
[54:50.430 --> 54:54.010]  That's what's been going on. That was us professionally vamping.
[54:54.170 --> 55:00.030]  I like the idea of you, of you giving all your old iPhones to Millie and telling her to give them to
[55:00.030 --> 55:09.110]  kids. These are your grandpa's phones. He'd leave those two are in the will.
[55:10.330 --> 55:17.490]  Good luck finding a connector. All of the fucking screens are busted on all of them.
[55:19.130 --> 55:24.150]  Every fucking one of them. Bastard shit. Yeah. It's at that point now where this time of the
[55:24.150 --> 55:28.230]  year, I don't know if everyone else deals with this, where my shitty phone won't last a day.
[55:28.690 --> 55:33.450]  Do you have that? No. Oh yeah. No, I'm okay right now. Oh really? You can get all the way to the
[55:33.450 --> 55:39.930]  evening? Yeah. Uh-huh. I can, I have about, when I get into bed at night, I usually am sitting
[55:39.930 --> 55:48.210]  around like 18 to 24% battery. Yeah. Right now. Huh. But I'm not on my phone all the, like I'm on
[55:48.210 --> 55:52.110]  this fucking computer more than anything anymore these days. Yeah. I'm not doing stuff. I listen
[55:52.110 --> 55:55.090]  to stuff from the phone quite a lot though. It's like pure Bluetooth playing something.
[55:55.650 --> 56:00.270]  No, I'm, I'm, I'm like that Gavin, but also like there's a lot of quick work and stuff,
[56:01.570 --> 56:07.090]  update things or whatever, social posts, whatever that I do from my phone. So I get a lot of work
[56:07.090 --> 56:13.910]  done from my phone, which is nice, but I don't know. I got that, whatever the newest good iPhone
[56:13.910 --> 56:18.710]  is. And it's like, it's fine, but the battery life is only like medium good. I think it's okay.
[56:19.290 --> 56:26.350]  Dude, the best purchase I've made in the last like four years is Henry. When he was near the,
[56:26.410 --> 56:30.910]  nearing the end, he was incontinent. He pissed. I don't know if you guys remember this. He pissed
[56:30.910 --> 56:36.790]  all over my laptop and it destroyed it. And I had to buy a new laptop and I was bummed about it.
[56:36.830 --> 56:42.050]  So I bought the cheapest Mac book air you can buy about like a $600 Mac book air has been the best
[56:42.050 --> 56:47.090]  fucking computer I've ever had. And it has the most amazing battery life that that talk about
[56:47.090 --> 56:51.650]  like shitty iPhone battery life. My Mac book air is the opposite of that. That thing is fucking
[56:51.650 --> 56:56.470]  wild. How long that battery lasts. And I ended up because it's so small and easy to use. I think I
[56:56.470 --> 56:59.630]  use it where I would use my phone a lot. Like if I'm going to go to a coffee shop or something,
[56:59.730 --> 57:03.210]  it's just easy to bring that instead of like trying to work on my phone. So that's probably
[57:03.210 --> 57:07.410]  why I use a little less, a little less phone. Yeah, that definitely makes sense for sure.
[57:07.810 --> 57:12.950]  I hate doing any work on my phone. Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't, I don't like it, but I don't,
[57:12.950 --> 57:18.130]  I don't want to go. I hate spending all day in my office. I'll go insane. I have to be in a
[57:18.130 --> 57:22.130]  different room. I just have to. Have you thought about putting your computer in a different room
[57:22.130 --> 57:28.250]  and using it from another room? What? What? Moving my computer? Like my PC?
[57:29.250 --> 57:33.430]  Put it, drill a hole in the wall. You want me to unplug and re-hook up my PC in a different room?
[57:33.650 --> 57:39.450]  Yeah. Bit of variety? Yeah. That, no, I don't consider doing that. If you're asking if that's,
[57:39.450 --> 57:46.350]  if I thought about doing it, no. Not yet. Good to know. I think I'd probably just buy a laptop
[57:46.350 --> 57:52.770]  if I had to do that. Andrew said, I got a hot mic and explosive anus. Oh no. It's very likely
[57:52.770 --> 57:57.870]  that Vince Vaughn is to be blamed for all this. What is he talking about? Did he watch a Vince
[57:57.870 --> 58:01.690]  Vaughn movie and think, oh, I'm going to have that for dinner. And then... Do you think he
[58:01.690 --> 58:06.510]  drank his slushie? Well, I don't know. A lot of people have pointed this out too, Eric.
[58:06.510 --> 58:10.550]  You were very protective over us blowing a balloon up in each other's mouths,
[58:10.730 --> 58:15.310]  but you were all for Andrew sucking down a four month old slushie. No, just taking a sip.
[58:16.250 --> 58:21.690]  Right. I'm with you, Gav. I think there's something there. I think Eric might secretly
[58:21.690 --> 58:26.110]  be trying to kill Andrew. No, not at all. I just, I just think if he thinks it's good,
[58:26.210 --> 58:30.470]  then who am I to say it's not? Well, let me ask you this then. Can I blow up a balloon in Andrew's
[58:30.470 --> 58:36.430]  mouth? No. Do you think if one of us dies, the rest of us will become a little more powerful?
[58:37.450 --> 58:41.330]  No. Like, we'll absorb their power and abilities and talent? Yeah. Yeah. Like,
[58:41.410 --> 58:45.370]  Jet Li in The One? I don't think so. Except if Andrew dies, we'll just all get his anus.
[58:45.550 --> 58:51.710]  We all have exploding anus. I already have his anus. I got enough anus over here. I don't need
[58:51.710 --> 59:01.390]  his. Do you think, who's got the best anus of the group? Nick. Yeah, probably. I eat pretty poorly.
[59:02.790 --> 59:06.610]  Like, it's always Nick. Like, who can run the fastest? Who's got the best anus? Nick's the
[59:06.610 --> 59:11.130]  fastest. Yeah, he's the fastest. He's got the best ass, you know. It's just classic Nick stuff. Yeah,
[59:11.210 --> 59:15.690]  dude. I'm healthy. So, do you do exercise, Nick? Is that why you can run the fastest?
[59:16.170 --> 59:23.230]  Yes. I, uh, I play basketball a lot. Yeah. He clearly exercises. He looks like he's in great
[59:23.230 --> 59:30.250]  shape. I mean, the thing that I know about Nick is that he played basketball in what seemed like a
[59:30.250 --> 59:36.490]  very upset way every day for, like, three years at the office. Yeah. Where he would just put on
[59:36.490 --> 59:41.270]  headphones and disappear and shoot hoops in a way that I can only imagine was like,
[59:41.650 --> 59:46.890]  fucking, goddamn, fucking, Jesus Christ, and just going out and doing that. That's just how it felt.
[59:47.250 --> 59:54.090]  Here's the thing about Nick, right? He's very thin, yet we know how much he eats. He eats like
[59:54.090 --> 01:00:00.630]  a barbarian. Like, that's well documented, right? Yeah. So, for Nick to maintain that weight,
[01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:05.630]  eating with as much intake as he has, he must have an insane metabolism rate. And the only
[01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:11.570]  way to maintain a metabolism rate that high at his age is through strenuous and consistent activity.
[01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:17.330]  Absolutely. Yeah. I want to be able to beat Nick at the 1500. Oh, I want you to. I think
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.970]  that would be good. Because I used to run that at school. I wasn't the fastest, but I could run long.
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:29.710]  And what year was that? Let me think. Yeah, probably legitimately the summer of 98.
[01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:33.510]  Oh, nothing's changed. You'll be, if you could do it, then you can do it now.
[01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:36.170]  It was a magical year, Gavin.
[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.890]  When was the last time you ran it, Nick, if ever?
[01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:47.750]  We're the same age. So probably, probably 98 or 99. I think we should do it. I think we should
[01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:52.990]  get together to see. All right. Me and Geoff will film it. Would love to see you guys do it.
[01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:56.290]  Good luck keeping up. Oh, yeah. We'll see you guys at the finish line.
[01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.610]  I'm also worried that I'll be, I'm overconfident and I'll legitimately die.
[01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.630]  You're going to hurt yourself. You're going to be legitimately hurt and Meg is going to kill us. Yeah.
[01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:17.970]  Yeah. I want to do this. I want to do this and I want to film it with you, Geoff, like me and you
[01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:21.430]  standing at like the finish line. I want to be eating hot dogs while we do it. Oh, I think that's
[01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:26.690]  a great idea. Be able to knock off some of my 70. Can maybe Nick and I get a, can there be like a
[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:34.550]  halfway dog station? You want to stop halfway to eat a hot dog to keep running for distance? Just
[01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:40.990]  a bite. I like this idea. I want something to be looking forward to. Yeah, let's do it. A hundred
[01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:48.310]  percent, dude. Should we call Andrew on the phone? Yeah, go for it. Sure. Ring him up. I can't use the
[01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:55.130]  phone. What? I don't have, if it's a phone call, if it's not like FaceTime, I can't do it.
[01:01:56.330 --> 01:02:01.470]  Uh, what? Yeah, there you go. There's seven. Well, there, there you go.
[01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:09.490]  Made it through another episode of The Regulation Podcast. You, uh, can you believe we talked about
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:15.310]  hot dogs twice in the episode? Did you get enough hot dog talk? I bet you didn't. If you didn't,
[01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.490]  there's a twofer coming over on the So All Right podcast. Don't forget to check that out for
[01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.650]  even more hot dog facts and figures. And in the meantime, we're going to be eating hot dogs and
[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:31.810]  running real fast. And we'll see you next week. Oh yeah, go to Regulatrion.com and find out all
[01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:37.370]  about how to give us money or not. Or not. Why would you want to learn about how to not give us
[01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:40.210]  money? Well, they don't have to give us money if they don't want to. No, they don't, but they don't
[01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:44.170]  have to learn about how to not give us money. Learn about how to give us money. Period. Don't
[01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:47.430]  learn about how not to give us money. Learn about how to give us money and then make an informed
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.290]  decision one way or the other. I don't give a fuck what the answer is, but yeah.
[01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.210]  Learn about how to not give us money. Yeah, just learn how to...
[01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:57.690]  Yeah. You know what? Just have a nice day. Okay. Oh, that sounds good. Bye.
