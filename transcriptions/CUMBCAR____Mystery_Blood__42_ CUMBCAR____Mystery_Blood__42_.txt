[00:30.040 --> 00:36.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 42.
[00:36.920 --> 00:43.960]  I am your host, my name is Baby Pepsi, and with me as always, Gassy Goo, The Mechanic,
[00:44.340 --> 00:51.040]  Lil Ricky B, and Gizmo. That's the first time I get to officially use our new nicknames,
[00:51.160 --> 00:57.220]  and I was so scared I was going to fuck it up this morning that I watched the nickname
[00:57.220 --> 01:01.080]  draft again the last 10 minutes just to make sure I had them all right, and then I practiced,
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.140]  and then I still almost fucked it up on my name out the gate. I thought you did great.
[01:07.100 --> 01:10.420]  God, you did fantastic. On the outside, I might have done well. On the inside,
[01:10.520 --> 01:15.460]  it was a dumpster fire. It was great. It came across great. Can we say before we
[01:15.460 --> 01:19.520]  really get going into this episode, I'm alarmed that Gavin is here. I'm very worried.
[01:20.260 --> 01:26.240]  I don't trust him being clean right now. That is true. He texted you or someone,
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.780]  I don't know if it was... He slacked it. He slacked it. Once again, he declared an emergency
[01:31.780 --> 01:38.700]  poo one minute before we were supposed to start, and then he showed up like 40 seconds later,
[01:38.980 --> 01:46.420]  which I don't understand. I didn't start the emergency poo at 10 59. I was just letting
[01:46.420 --> 01:50.440]  you know I was still dealing with one. Yeah, but the fact that you showed up so soon,
[01:50.440 --> 01:57.860]  the fact that you felt the need to alert us that that was occurring yet still showed up.
[01:57.940 --> 02:03.060]  Well, let's be fair. I know how long it takes me to wipe and I was budgeting accordingly.
[02:03.340 --> 02:05.680]  How long does it take? How long does it take you to wipe?
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.800]  I probably do it for a minute. That's a lot of wiping, dude. You must have a raw asshole.
[02:12.020 --> 02:16.260]  We also know, though, however, that Gavin has a system worked out where he doesn't have to
[02:16.260 --> 02:20.300]  wash his hands after he goes to the bathroom because they don't they never touch anything
[02:20.300 --> 02:23.800]  other than his phone, apparently. So I guess that cuts down on time.
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.720]  That's for a specific bog and only for piss. And I still and the whole point is I still
[02:28.720 --> 02:34.160]  wash my hands anyway. I'm just saying I don't have to. Why bother? Why bother? Because
[02:34.700 --> 02:39.200]  just I wash my hands a bunch every day. Can I can I ask a can I ask a personal
[02:39.200 --> 02:47.360]  question? You can you feel free not to answer this. When you do podcast poo like this,
[02:47.460 --> 02:51.340]  are you using your knuckle method or is this no need for the knuckle method?
[02:51.460 --> 02:53.700]  I was wondering that as well. No, that's no need.
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.580]  Oh, I'm not. Well, you do both. You don't you don't do one, just one. You do both.
[02:59.100 --> 03:00.640]  Yeah, you do both when you poo. Both knuckles?
[03:01.040 --> 03:03.900]  I don't think I've ever taken a shit and not peed in my life.
[03:04.220 --> 03:07.320]  Yeah. Oh, no, I'm saying if if there's poo involved, I don't knuckle.
[03:08.460 --> 03:09.600]  Hmm. Don't trust it.
[03:10.500 --> 03:13.840]  You also said something. You said something I thought was interesting a few seconds ago
[03:13.840 --> 03:20.300]  on the why bother front. You said, yeah, I don't have to wash my hands, but I do anyway.
[03:20.460 --> 03:24.640]  I wash my hands tons of a bunch of times a day. Why bother? Why bother going through the process
[03:24.640 --> 03:27.900]  of telling us you could get through using the bathroom without washing your hands if you're
[03:27.900 --> 03:29.880]  also going to wash your hands? Yeah.
[03:30.100 --> 03:33.580]  Well, the discussion was with Meg. I was like, look, surely I don't have to do this.
[03:34.140 --> 03:37.720]  But I I didn't ever just not ever wash my hands.
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.160]  Why? What did who the conversation was with have to do with anything?
[03:43.980 --> 03:45.680]  Is Meg in the room with us right now?
[03:46.040 --> 03:48.700]  Yeah. That's a that's a weird clarification.
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.420]  Well, like sometimes, right? Sometimes Jeff will say something
[03:53.420 --> 03:58.160]  about a conversation with Emily or Eric. Why do you drag my wife into this?
[03:58.380 --> 04:03.300]  Small wife. I'm just saying that was the person who I had the conversation with about
[04:03.580 --> 04:07.460]  Holy shit, don't you have to wash my hands? I'm just enjoying. I said one thing and we're
[04:07.460 --> 04:10.160]  all going at you for different things. I'm just trying to add on to it.
[04:10.200 --> 04:12.860]  I'm really enjoying it. And someone who's typically on the back foot.
[04:13.540 --> 04:16.840]  I would say the audience is pretty on board with the old the knuckling.
[04:17.400 --> 04:19.520]  I was on board with the knuckling. Not that they do it with a knuckle.
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.340]  Yeah, it's just the way you said it. What was wrong with the way I said it?
[04:24.500 --> 04:27.780]  You said it. I don't want to say everyone.
[04:27.860 --> 04:31.360]  Obviously, that's not true. But I feel the majority of people I saw
[04:32.380 --> 04:35.280]  vocalize they agreed with you, but that you described it in a poor way.
[04:36.440 --> 04:40.940]  Well, what's new there? The only reason the knuckle came into it is because I was trying to invent
[04:41.760 --> 04:44.840]  a bidet attachment that just had a little knuckle on it that came out.
[04:45.380 --> 04:49.680]  It could have been anything. It could have been a ball. It could have been a fingertip.
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.220]  You know, we were saying that we could we could invent the tool. Emily was saying you should
[04:55.220 --> 04:58.320]  call it a moose knuckle. But I was just thinking you could call it a goose knuckle.
[04:58.800 --> 05:00.560]  Wait, why? Why are you bringing Emily into this?
[05:01.400 --> 05:10.500]  Hell yeah, because I wanted to give her credit for the idea that I then modified.
[05:10.600 --> 05:15.940]  He was explaining the context of it, where your reference to that you had a conversation with Meg
[05:15.940 --> 05:21.720]  was set in an offensive tone as if that somehow clarified something, where it was just really
[05:22.240 --> 05:24.120]  an additional piece of info that was irrelevant.
[05:24.320 --> 05:26.520]  If this keeps the fight going, I'm on Gavin's side.
[05:30.680 --> 05:33.160]  So has anyone tried it in between? No.
[05:34.800 --> 05:39.420]  I mean, I kind of have my own pull and tug and shake.
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.420]  OK, let's hear it. So you pretty much deal with the penis?
[05:43.040 --> 05:47.300]  Yeah, I mostly just deal with the penis. I don't really I don't really fuck with the
[05:47.920 --> 05:53.220]  gooch that much. I mostly just like pull and tug and yank and shake and go, goddammit, dude,
[05:53.860 --> 05:58.880]  stop. Just stop dripping. Be done. For fuck's sake, be done.
[05:59.500 --> 06:01.520]  Nick has his own method as well. OK.
[06:01.660 --> 06:05.720]  Oh, yes. It's like Jeff's. It's like, come on, let's go. I got shit to do. Get the drips out.
[06:06.140 --> 06:07.520]  And how long are we dripping for typically?
[06:08.880 --> 06:11.560]  You add like four seconds every year of age.
[06:11.960 --> 06:16.560]  At this point, at this point, I drip way longer than I pee.
[06:17.060 --> 06:22.900]  I think people got the wrong end of the stick because I was talking about
[06:23.220 --> 06:28.740]  going from the back with the bidet. I don't ever touch any of that from behind.
[06:28.980 --> 06:33.040]  Right. I don't even have to touch my skin. I can do it through my boxes.
[06:33.480 --> 06:39.500]  Urinal. I could just get a finger, you know, up by the balls, through the boxes,
[06:39.800 --> 06:42.600]  give it a little and then my I'm done.
[06:43.260 --> 06:47.200]  My issue is never with the journey as much as it was the location.
[06:47.340 --> 06:51.580]  And you can't really change that. You can tell me you're going north.
[06:51.580 --> 06:55.120]  You're going east. It doesn't really matter. It's where we're landing is.
[06:55.460 --> 06:57.800]  Yeah, it was less about the approach and more about the destination.
[07:01.340 --> 07:03.760]  But I mean, we can change it up if you want. You can tell me we're going.
[07:03.900 --> 07:07.300]  We're going different direction. We're going to go up the right leg.
[07:07.320 --> 07:10.980]  We're going to hook around the thigh. We're going to go up over the belly button.
[07:13.620 --> 07:17.480]  I what about if it was just the toilet seat that shocked you?
[07:18.080 --> 07:20.260]  They gave you a little electric shock. How do you feel about that?
[07:20.260 --> 07:23.020]  What? What does it do?
[07:23.340 --> 07:26.440]  It shocks you. I felt that part was very clear.
[07:26.740 --> 07:29.300]  Why does it? So you get to pee out.
[07:29.540 --> 07:31.080]  Sucks. This sucks.
[07:31.400 --> 07:34.360]  You think you electrocute the piss out? Yeah, I think you could.
[07:34.480 --> 07:37.880]  I think you could surprise yourself and go, oh, and you know,
[07:37.920 --> 07:40.880]  your body like tenses up and then you get all the drips out.
[07:41.160 --> 07:43.240]  It's easier than changing underwear. I'll do it.
[07:44.420 --> 07:50.020]  So if I sit on a couple of shock collars and see if it helps get the dregs out.
[07:51.560 --> 07:52.940]  That'd be a good test for you?
[07:54.580 --> 08:00.300]  If you put if you put an anti-bark collar on your ass and farted, would you shock yourself?
[08:00.920 --> 08:03.780]  Would that be enough to trigger it? What detects that bark?
[08:03.900 --> 08:04.860]  Is it sound? I don't know.
[08:05.080 --> 08:06.740]  Is it sound? Is it vibration?
[08:07.340 --> 08:11.080]  I have no clue what causes those things to shock, but I never thought of
[08:11.080 --> 08:15.020]  if you could activate one via a fart, but that's very funny to me.
[08:15.220 --> 08:18.200]  What if we collared Jeff's testicles with a shock collar?
[08:19.580 --> 08:21.740]  That's not necessary. That's not necessary. We don't need to do that.
[08:21.800 --> 08:24.300]  What we need to do is we need to do it and I'll do it if you do it.
[08:24.300 --> 08:29.760]  OK, I'll do it if you do it. I go in, I stand at the urinal and I pee.
[08:29.920 --> 08:35.240]  And as soon as I wrap up and I begin the dripping, shaking, pulling, pleading,
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.160]  begging process, you electrocute me with a stun gun in the back.
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.800]  And then we'll see what happens. And then I'll do it to you.
[08:44.800 --> 08:49.620]  And then that way, that way we both get to the urinal.
[08:50.100 --> 08:54.760]  It's we're both miserable. We did. And we we have two people sample size to determine
[08:54.760 --> 08:59.000]  the success of it. There's no way to just bang my cock into the ceramic.
[08:59.220 --> 09:03.020]  We'll see. I don't know. We don't. It would be a low voltage. We'll do it on a low.
[09:04.500 --> 09:08.920]  I think just the fear that you could be zapped would be enough.
[09:10.440 --> 09:15.180]  I think having someone stand behind you with a stun gun and, you know, it's possible that they
[09:15.180 --> 09:20.180]  might shoot you with it would get you record drip time. Maybe that's what we need. Maybe we need to
[09:20.180 --> 09:26.200]  do a religion style and just rule by fear. Oh, yeah. Just every bathroom has a stun gun that
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.620]  zooms out as soon as you start pulling up your underwear. Nestles in right next to your butt.
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.320]  I think the thing I'm most suspicious of is that Eric is of an age very similar to the
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.420]  amount of podcasts we've done and is still doing all of his squeezing internally, apparently.
[09:43.940 --> 09:50.220]  Yep. How do you do that? You just sort of, you know, keep it healthy. You keep it healthy. I
[09:50.220 --> 09:55.320]  feel like a squeezer would agree with my shock method, Eric. How do you feel? I don't I don't
[09:55.320 --> 10:01.940]  know why you you're insane. Put an electric toilet seat and then zap your ass to get.
[10:02.100 --> 10:06.120]  But it doesn't happen every time. I think it only happens sometimes.
[10:06.120 --> 10:10.860]  I don't want it to happen any times, Andrew. It does not need to happen ever. I don't think.
[10:11.260 --> 10:15.360]  Yeah, you do like a little bit squeezing. Sometimes you just got to like you kind of stand there for
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.340]  an extra like little bit and give it a like a little bit of time. But you just sort of internal
[10:20.340 --> 10:26.100]  squeezing. Do you do internal squeezing throughout the day? What do you mean? I'm asking Gavin.
[10:27.360 --> 10:35.680]  Like the kegels? Yeah. Not really. Am I supposed to? I mean, I think it's like working a muscle a
[10:35.680 --> 10:39.660]  little bit, isn't it? You don't work out your kegel muscles? I don't really think to.
[10:41.620 --> 10:44.840]  How's that working out for you? Yeah, maybe I should. So what's your routine?
[10:45.060 --> 10:47.940]  How many reps? The answer is not well, he's fingering his asshole.
[10:49.660 --> 10:54.060]  I'm not I'm not doing reps. Sometimes you just got to, you know, if you're just kind of like
[10:54.060 --> 10:58.340]  sitting, you sit and squeeze. But Gavin, I'm going to be honest with you. The whole time
[10:58.340 --> 11:04.640]  we're talking right now, brother, I'm squeezing. I did it for a second, but I got tired.
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.480]  It's exhausting. Just put a shock seat. I got to be honest, I didn't think we'd be this far into
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.160]  this episode still talking about Gavin's bathroom. I figured we'd be talking nicknames way more than
[11:15.160 --> 11:20.120]  we have. And we just went right into fingering butts or whatever. I got one last thing on
[11:20.120 --> 11:28.040]  toilets and then I'm going to move on. Do we do you think there's a way? That you know how
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.400]  fingerprints are identifiable? Is there anything on our ass that makes us uniquely identifiable?
[11:33.400 --> 11:40.160]  I have a mole. Oh, I guess that'd be scanning. I don't know how I'd feel about that. I was just
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.860]  thinking about if you have a shock toilet seat, you might not necessarily want everybody in your
[11:44.860 --> 11:50.020]  household to be part of it. So if there's a way like you could sit on it and it like
[11:50.020 --> 11:54.740]  registers your cheeks. Yeah, like a butt thumbprint. Yeah, I'm pretty sure the anus is
[11:54.740 --> 11:58.880]  pretty unique because there was that service wasn't there that turned your anus into little
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.200]  chocolates. I don't want it to scan my anus, though. That's too personal. I don't like.
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.120]  That'd be a really funny thing to see fingerprints and anal print on a seat for a criminal.
[12:12.160 --> 12:16.360]  Sir, sir, we swept the whole place. Did you get any fingerprints? No. And you're not going to
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.280]  like what I have to say next. His anus was all over the place. He was beheaded so we couldn't
[12:21.280 --> 12:26.500]  get dental records. But thank God they left the anus intact. I just thought of them dusting down
[12:26.500 --> 12:36.340]  a door knob and being like, this isn't fingers. Oh, man. Hey, we there's two things I'd like to
[12:36.340 --> 12:38.920]  talk about today, if you guys don't mind. One, I would like to talk about a recent,
[12:39.820 --> 12:46.100]  I don't know, a heartbreak or setback the company has had. Maybe we can discuss. And then the second
[12:46.100 --> 12:51.560]  thing I'd like to talk about at some point today. Just don't let me forget. I am in a deja vu
[12:51.560 --> 12:57.100]  nightmare that I cannot seem to break out of this week. I love it. And it's making it's making
[12:58.720 --> 13:04.560]  nighttime miserable for me. Do do I know about the company heartbreak? Yeah, I think you do. Yeah.
[13:04.740 --> 13:08.480]  Yeah. We can cover that real fast. But, you know, we've been talking a lot about getting an office
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.000]  and that being something that we're working towards. We have we don't like to announce
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.540]  announcements, if at all possible. We don't like to talk, you know, get too far ahead of our skis
[13:18.540 --> 13:23.040]  on this stuff. But we had been making a lot of progress in the background. So much progress,
[13:23.160 --> 13:30.840]  in fact, that we found an office. We toured it three times, went ahead and put in an application,
[13:31.140 --> 13:38.380]  got approved for the application. I paid the deposit. And while I was waiting for the lease
[13:38.380 --> 13:44.620]  to sign, the landlord decided not to rent to us and we lost the place. And we don't really know
[13:44.620 --> 13:49.680]  why. It's kind of a bummer. It's more than a bummer. It really sucks because it was about three
[13:49.680 --> 13:55.460]  to four weeks of it's basically all of January behind the scenes. We're running around looking
[13:55.460 --> 14:01.180]  at properties. And Eric and I specifically were dealing with a real like landlords and real
[14:01.180 --> 14:06.400]  estate agents and a tenant. And I had to put in a lot of time in with this tenant to get in his
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.900]  good graces. It was a whole thing. And just like the rug got pulled out from under us at the 11th
[14:11.900 --> 14:17.640]  and a half hour. And I just... We tested a lot of the walks to coffee shops and stuff. We did. We
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.700]  were all over the neighborhood. We had started to plan where stuff was going to go. It was the
[14:22.700 --> 14:27.700]  really frustrating thing was it was a perfect space for us. Like it was it checked off literally
[14:27.700 --> 14:33.700]  every single need we had and was affordable. And it just sucks because now we're back to
[14:34.280 --> 14:38.860]  you know we're back to zero and we have to start all over again. And so that's a little
[14:38.860 --> 14:42.740]  behind the curtain of stuff that we you know that was going on in January that we weren't really
[14:42.740 --> 14:46.100]  talking about publicly because we wanted to get the office first before we brought it up. And
[14:46.100 --> 14:53.240]  because we were so excited about it you know. And then we fucking lost it. Do you think the
[14:53.820 --> 14:59.900]  owner listened to regulation 41 and just decided? Genuinely no. I don't think it had anything to do
[14:59.900 --> 15:05.140]  with that. We also lost it before 41 came out. So it would have been 40 that did us in. What I
[15:05.140 --> 15:11.120]  think happened is I think the landlord decided they wanted to sell the place and I wanted they
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.440]  wanted to give us a short lease and I pushed back on that. And I wanted at least a year lease and
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.740]  that's where we lost it. Which is ludicrous to ask for anything less than a year lease. So I think
[15:19.740 --> 15:23.860]  it probably means they were just trying to have a stopgap solution until they were ready to put the
[15:23.860 --> 15:27.940]  place on the market and sell it. Yeah I was so excited initially when you said that we got rejected
[15:27.940 --> 15:34.460]  because I thought it would be for content reasons. And that's very funny. At the final hour being
[15:34.460 --> 15:39.540]  like well maybe I should look into this a little bit and seeing you with a jackhammer in your
[15:39.540 --> 15:48.260]  backyard making a bean hole. No no. Luckily the hot dogs on the on the fan hadn't come out yet.
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.280]  Nick said it was probably cum related. It might have been who knows. But we definitely
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.880]  we definitely lost our office and we don't have one and now we're if you if you know of an office
[15:58.880 --> 16:08.860]  in Austin let Eric know. We'll get another one. Please don't let Eric know. I did the benefit for
[16:08.860 --> 16:12.720]  you of looking at some research of some office buildings. Thanks man. Yeah appreciate it. Really
[16:12.720 --> 16:17.140]  appreciate it. Thank you so much. Keep it to yourself. Appreciate you. Anyway it's it's I
[16:17.140 --> 16:21.880]  bring it up more just to tell you guys a little bit of behind the scenes with a little like a
[16:21.880 --> 16:26.280]  little squeeze of sausage out of the tube. But also just to show you that it's it's been a really
[16:26.280 --> 16:31.380]  successful wild wonderful launch and things have gone incredibly well and almost every front and
[16:31.380 --> 16:36.380]  this is just an example of one that didn't work out for us. That's very true. Gotta throw that out
[16:36.380 --> 16:44.220]  there. What would be the name of our office? Cumhouse. Oh we're in the cum era? No I don't know.
[16:44.700 --> 16:50.740]  I really don't know. That happened that happened outside of main regulation canon but that was uh
[16:50.740 --> 16:55.040]  if you're interested in the origins of cum with a b that was from our Mario Party
[16:55.040 --> 17:04.260]  gurple tines day stream. $8,000. $8,000 and that's the scenario was eight grand but you have to spell
[17:04.260 --> 17:09.660]  cum with a silent b at the end. For the rest of your life. Yeah I've done a I've done a lot of these you
[17:09.660 --> 17:15.260]  know a million dollars but which are always quite involved. It's a big life change. I like the idea
[17:15.260 --> 17:21.240]  of little dreggy amounts that would make a huge difference to like a year but over the span of
[17:21.240 --> 17:26.540]  your lifetime you wouldn't even be able to notice. I I'm really curious to know what you consider
[17:27.220 --> 17:34.040]  like canon content. Regulation podcast. Just that? It's just the podcast? Well some people don't
[17:34.940 --> 17:39.260]  don't even talk about gameplay stuff. Absolutely yeah it's just that was like a big gurp alert like
[17:39.260 --> 17:45.100]  I feel like that was a big event stream for us. That that feels like if it was if it was yeah
[17:45.100 --> 17:49.260]  like if any supplemental content would be considered canon I feel like that would be the
[17:49.260 --> 17:54.180]  one because it was a direct response to something that happened on the podcast. I was just curious
[17:54.180 --> 17:59.880]  if you had specific like because I've never considered like what is or isn't mainline canon
[17:59.880 --> 18:04.720]  for this podcast. I think that's an interesting thought. Well I mean it leaks into the canon
[18:04.720 --> 18:11.860]  because I actually have a request of Jeff. Oh we got some canon leakage? Yeah can I uh
[18:11.860 --> 18:17.200]  can I make a request for the license plate of my car? Oh yeah you can make a request.
[18:19.260 --> 18:26.880]  You want cum car? Yeah uh let's see if it's available. Yeah we'll see if it's available
[18:26.880 --> 18:37.340]  and uh yeah. C-U-M-B? C-A-R. Maybe if we spell it C-U-M-B space B-C-A-R they'll fall for it.
[18:39.840 --> 18:40.880]  C-U-M-B-C-A-R.

[19:44.780 --> 19:46.180]  So you're in deja vu, Jeff?
[19:46.400 --> 19:53.020]  Oh my God. All right. This story is a little raw. I haven't thought exactly how to tell it yet,
[19:53.120 --> 19:59.960]  so I apologize if it's a little meandering. But Sunday night, I go to bed, go to sleep,
[20:00.200 --> 20:03.780]  probably at one or two in the morning because I've been playing Warzone with the truck boys
[20:03.780 --> 20:10.220]  every night. And at like maybe 3-3.30, I get up to take a piss as most men my age do.
[20:10.680 --> 20:16.020]  I go into my bathroom and take a piss. Pitch black, of course, right? But you know how to
[20:16.020 --> 20:21.560]  move around your room at night. And I take a piss like normal. And as I'm coming back to my bed,
[20:22.020 --> 20:26.740]  I'm standing next to my nightstand about to get in. My mouth is dry because I have this stupid...
[20:28.060 --> 20:30.480]  What do you call it? Like mouth guard I have to use every night now.
[20:31.520 --> 20:37.720]  And as I'm getting into bed, I see next to my nightstand, there's a white monster energy drink
[20:37.720 --> 20:41.200]  sitting there. I think that I had put there literally at like 8.30 in the morning when I
[20:41.200 --> 20:45.260]  was getting ready and forgot about it. And it just sat there all day. And I thought,
[20:45.380 --> 20:51.000]  oh, I'll just grab some of that to wet my mouth down and then go back to bed, right?
[20:51.040 --> 20:56.480]  And so I went to grab it and I pick it up and I drink it with just a little swig. And then I put
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.620]  back on the nightstand. But somehow I put it on the nightstand wrong and it falls over and it
[21:01.620 --> 21:10.180]  spills an entire giant white monster. It's like going all down the floor. It's hit hardwood floor,
[21:10.580 --> 21:18.440]  a rug. It's everywhere. And it spills. It hits me in my jammies. So I'm covered in
[21:18.440 --> 21:25.580]  my sticky on my pants and my shirt. And Emily and the dog are sleep snoring loudly next to me.
[21:25.580 --> 21:31.140]  So I'm like, it's dark. I can't turn the lights on because I don't want Emily. Emily has to get
[21:31.140 --> 21:34.920]  up and go to work in the morning. Emily works hard days. It's just 12 hour days. I try to be
[21:34.920 --> 21:40.680]  very respectful of that. And then if the dog wakes up, who knows? If he gets up, then we're all
[21:40.680 --> 21:43.820]  fucked, right? He's a hard sleep. He's a heavy sleeper. But once he's awake, he's awake.
[21:44.620 --> 21:49.020]  And so I just like, I'm like, fuck, what do I do? I'm not the kind of person that can leave
[21:49.020 --> 21:53.200]  it till morning. I just I don't have that in me. I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. So I go
[21:53.200 --> 21:57.180]  into the bathroom and I just grab a towel and I wet it down. And in the dark, I get on my hands
[21:57.180 --> 22:02.540]  and knees and I just scrub the floor as best as I can in the dark. And then I get another towel
[22:02.540 --> 22:08.000]  and I try to dry it all up and get it as clean as I can as quietly as I can. And then I realize I
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.740]  have to change my clothes. So I go into the bathroom and I shut the door so I can take my
[22:11.740 --> 22:16.260]  jammies off and get the sticky stuff off my arms and legs or wherever that not my legs, but my
[22:16.260 --> 22:21.120]  arms and like wherever it hit me and then go put new jammies on and then go to bed. So it's like
[22:21.120 --> 22:26.260]  I'm like 20 minutes in to getting up to take a piss at this point of trying not to wake them up.
[22:27.200 --> 22:35.500]  Monday night, the next night, I'm playing Warzone with the truck boys about two o'clock. I come to
[22:35.500 --> 22:41.320]  bed. I get into bed, put my head on the pillow and realize I have to take a piss. And it's like
[22:41.320 --> 22:44.440]  one of those ones where it's like, could you sleep? I could probably sleep till six or seven
[22:44.440 --> 22:48.400]  a.m. and be fine, but I'd rather just I'd rather sleep well. Right. And just get it out of the way.
[22:48.400 --> 22:54.200]  So I get back up. I go into the bathroom. I take my piss. I come back to my desk or to get back
[22:54.200 --> 23:04.180]  into my bed. And next to me, I see a Gerpler full of Italian limeade soda that I bought myself from
[23:04.180 --> 23:07.700]  Central Market the other Whole Foods the other day as a treat. I was like, I deserve something
[23:07.700 --> 23:12.200]  special, something better than diet Pepsi. So I bought this Italian soda that's like limeade,
[23:12.240 --> 23:17.380]  right? It's the stickiest, sugariest, sweetest thing ever. I had brought it upstairs with me
[23:17.380 --> 23:21.120]  at like eleven o'clock at night because I knew I was gonna be playing with the truck boys all
[23:21.120 --> 23:24.340]  night long and you get thirsty. And the last thing you want to do is go all the way back
[23:24.340 --> 23:27.800]  downstairs to your kitchen to get a drink and come back up. But once again, I had set it on
[23:27.800 --> 23:30.840]  the nightstand and forgotten about it. And it sat there the whole time I played trucks.
[23:31.160 --> 23:38.500]  So I go, oh, I'll just have a sip of this and I go to pick it up and I and I do and everything's
[23:38.500 --> 23:44.600]  fine. And I take a sip and I set it back down. But I guess I set it on my glasses, my reading
[23:44.600 --> 23:50.980]  glasses. And so it falls, but it falls the other way towards the wall. Oh, no. And this thing is
[23:50.980 --> 23:57.080]  it's a Gerpler, goddammit. It's full. And so also it rolls down, hits the ground, it goes
[23:57.080 --> 24:02.260]  to the dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog. It rolls, making this large plastic bounce noise as
[24:02.260 --> 24:09.160]  it goes around. Oh, the sticky juice hits. Well, first off, what happens is I'm frozen. This is
[24:09.160 --> 24:14.080]  my deja vu nightmare. I look at it and I think this has already happened. This is no big deal. This
[24:14.080 --> 24:18.620]  already happened. This happened last night. And so I don't do anything because I'm like not fully
[24:18.620 --> 24:23.380]  there. And I just watch it kind of before I can, like maybe three or four seconds before I realize,
[24:23.460 --> 24:26.120]  oh, no, this is happening again right now. This just happened yesterday. It's happening again.
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.640]  How is this happening to me again? I don't understand it, right? So you were having a,
[24:29.780 --> 24:33.140]  you thought you might have been having a flashback at first. Yeah, I just like get
[24:33.140 --> 24:36.940]  rid of that where you're not fully there and you just freeze in the moment. Yeah, this doesn't
[24:36.940 --> 24:39.880]  make sense. Like I'm not understanding what's going on in the world right now. Like I'm
[24:39.880 --> 24:45.620]  existing in, I'm like unstuck in time, like in fucking, uh, uh, like in that book. I love the
[24:45.620 --> 24:49.440]  idea of it being like in slow motion, bouncing all around, slushing liquid. And you're just,
[24:49.700 --> 24:53.080]  you're just like, this can't be right. This can't be happening again. Yeah, this isn't...
[24:53.960 --> 24:57.580]  I'm unstuck like in Slaughterhouse. Yeah. And you're like, no, this didn't, this, I don't have
[24:57.580 --> 25:00.860]  to deal with this right now because this already happened yesterday. Right. And then I realized
[25:00.860 --> 25:06.680]  that and I go, oh God. And, uh, and I look over and the dog and the wife are still asleep and
[25:06.680 --> 25:12.520]  it is so much more liquid. And so my first thought is to go down to my knees to see how bad it is.
[25:12.640 --> 25:19.020]  So I just dropped to my knees into a puddle of liquid. So now my new jammies are soaked
[25:19.020 --> 25:24.040]  at the knees, just like completely and totally soaked. Right. So I'm like, oh, you fucking
[25:25.160 --> 25:30.540]  double moron. Like you're extra stupid. So I get up and I go into the bathroom and I take my
[25:30.540 --> 25:35.760]  fucking jammies off again. And then I get more towels and then I start to scrub in and I start
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.000]  to clean it. And this is somehow so much worse than the monster energy drink, this, this Italian
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.240]  soda. And it's just like, there's so much more of it and it's everywhere. And as I'm going through
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.780]  it in the dark, I realize it gets on, I wrote it all down to make sure I don't forget. It gets on
[25:49.780 --> 25:56.760]  my lamp, my laptop, my reading glasses, my phone charging station, my watch, my phone itself,
[25:56.880 --> 26:02.380]  the book I'm reading all just covered in it. Right. I also don't notice till the next day
[26:02.380 --> 26:06.820]  that even though it fell backwards, some of the water went forward as well, obviously.
[26:07.580 --> 26:13.120]  And the bottom drawer was slightly open on my nightstand. So I had a heating pad that just
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.000]  got covered in, uh, in soda somehow. Uh, so that was all sticky and ruined. I didn't find that out
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.680]  till much later. And so I'm on the ground under, under my nightstand and my bed, uh, like laying
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.580]  down to get, uh, cause I can't get under the bed well enough, you know, on my knees, uh, like
[26:27.580 --> 26:32.200]  literally laying on the ground naked, just rubbing the ground with a wet and a dry towel
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.440]  for maybe 25 minutes. This time, uh, the whole time it doing it in the dark. So I don't want
[26:37.440 --> 26:43.600]  to wake up Emily and the dog put on new jammies, go to bed the next night. I go, I'm not, I'm not
[26:43.600 --> 26:46.880]  bringing anything with me to do. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. It's never going to happen
[26:46.880 --> 26:53.640]  again. Right? No. Uh, so I don't, and then everything's fine last night. No, come on Jeff.
[26:54.120 --> 27:00.120]  Last night, this is anticlimactic. Last night we, uh, we went to the Bill Simmons podcast live
[27:00.120 --> 27:03.980]  in Austin at the Paramount theater. And so I didn't get a chance to eat dinner before I went.
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.920]  We didn't get home till about 11 o'clock. I swing by McDonald's on the way home,
[27:08.360 --> 27:13.000]  grab, uh, just some McDonald's for us. We eat dinner and then we go upstairs to go to bed.
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.240]  I have a giant diet Coke, like a large diet Coke with the top off because I've been chopping on
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.140]  ice. And I set it on my nightstand and then I look at it and I go, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope,
[27:23.180 --> 27:27.500]  not doing that. So I pick it up and I put it in the kit in the bathroom next to the sink.
[27:27.540 --> 27:31.900]  And then I go about my business. And then later, like an hour later, I, or maybe a half hour later,
[27:31.900 --> 27:35.020]  I go back into the bedroom and it's all the nightstand again. And I realized at some point,
[27:35.060 --> 27:38.100]  I picked it up and put it back on the nightstand and I went, Nope, not, you're not checking
[27:38.100 --> 27:42.540]  yourself that, that this time dumbass. So I'd make an effort to go and put it back in the bathroom.
[27:42.540 --> 27:47.640]  Right. Then I decided not to play trucks with the truck boy or called it with the truck boys last
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.180]  night. And just to go to bed early. So I go to bed at like, it's like 1130 by the time we go to
[27:52.180 --> 27:57.800]  bed, you know, and maybe midnight and, uh, about 2am I have to pee. So I get up in the middle of
[27:57.800 --> 28:01.820]  the night and I go to the bathroom and I pee and I'm coming back to the bathroom and I see the diet
[28:01.820 --> 28:09.420]  Coke on the counter and I go, I'm safe. And I go to pick it up to have a, have a victory sip because
[28:09.420 --> 28:13.460]  I'm so smart. It's not on my nightstand and I just punch it. I just punch it as hard as I can.
[28:13.460 --> 28:18.440]  I don't even know how, and it just goes straight into the sink. It just goes straight into the
[28:18.440 --> 28:22.880]  fucking sink. There's no mess, but I pour an entire diet Coke and all, and there's still
[28:22.880 --> 28:28.840]  some ice in it. Not a lot into the sink and I just lose the entire thing and I just can't believe it.
[28:28.900 --> 28:32.600]  And so I go to bed, but I don't know what to do now. I'm scared to go to bed tonight
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.240]  because it's three out of the last four nights. I've spilled major amounts of liquid in the
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.120]  process of getting up to go to the bathroom. I'm terrified. I don't know how I've I'm stuck
[28:43.120 --> 28:48.920]  in this cycle. I don't know how to get out of it. I was conscious of it last night when I literally,
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.220]  I'm looking at my hand and I'm like, I'm going to have this, this diet Coke is going to taste
[28:53.220 --> 28:57.360]  so fucking sweet at two 15 in the morning because I'm not going to be cleaning it up three minutes
[28:57.360 --> 29:03.040]  from now. And then I still manage to just like fucking like karate chop it. I don't know what's
[29:03.040 --> 29:07.180]  wrong with me. Were you getting flashbacks to a purple nightmare while you were cleaning up?
[29:07.300 --> 29:10.940]  Didn't, didn't think about it at all. I wasn't thinking about anything other than misery.
[29:10.940 --> 29:16.700]  When you're on the ground at three in the morning, rolling around in dog hair and, you know,
[29:17.780 --> 29:22.380]  fucking dust bunnies under your bed and you're just trying to clean up sticky liquid. You're
[29:22.380 --> 29:25.480]  not thinking about purple nightmare. I didn't have that, but I didn't have that many mental
[29:25.480 --> 29:30.080]  faculties going. Why don't you just bring water to bed? It's still, I mean, he'd still spill.
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.720]  It does matter, dude. It matters if it gets into the walls, if it gets into the door,
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.820]  it seeps under the floor, like it still matters. It still gets into the electric equipment.
[29:40.940 --> 29:47.200]  You need a sippy cup lid for your Gerpler. I was actually thinking this is the perfect
[29:47.200 --> 29:52.400]  opportunity to invent something. Gerpler silences. Like imagine a little rubber gasket.
[29:53.340 --> 29:59.680]  One that is the perfect dimensions to push into the bottom of the Gerpler and then a rubber o-ring
[29:59.680 --> 30:04.540]  around the rim with just like a little mouth size cutout. And that way, if you drop the Gerpler,
[30:04.740 --> 30:08.620]  completely quiet. What you're saying, what you're describing is a Gerplid.
[30:10.040 --> 30:15.940]  We need to invent a Gerplid. Yeah, but also one for the bottom. I would love a Gerplid because
[30:15.940 --> 30:22.720]  I have a problem with my desk where I have wires everywhere just crossing and whatnot. And I will
[30:22.720 --> 30:28.060]  fill up my Gerpler at the middle of the night and then try to put on my desk and not be able to see
[30:28.060 --> 30:33.560]  because I'm in the dark, but just know it's wire, wire, wire, and being so scared of dumping that
[30:33.560 --> 30:38.860]  full giant cup of liquid all over all of my tech stuff. What's in your night, Gerpler?
[30:39.540 --> 30:43.840]  What do you mean? Well, it's just water. Okay. And just like I'll fill it up in the bathroom,
[30:44.360 --> 30:49.720]  go to sit down at my desk, and then I won't be able to see very well. And is the thing of like,
[30:49.800 --> 30:56.580]  I got to really feel out where this cup is. I do not trust it. But a Gerplid, that would change.
[30:56.700 --> 31:02.620]  That is a game changer. So you get water from your bathroom tap? Yeah. Why don't you just drink out
[31:02.620 --> 31:09.660]  the tap? What? What? Well, do you come back and like finish a whole Gerpler of water? Yeah,
[31:10.100 --> 31:14.480]  absolutely. How do you not like get up in the night to piss? I piss all the time at night.
[31:14.740 --> 31:20.200]  Oh, you just don't care. I just, I drink. I need to drink. I like, I like drinking. I like drink.
[31:20.240 --> 31:26.300]  I like having like a something to sip on whether it's water, mainly water. I'm a drinks guy. Big
[31:26.300 --> 31:32.340]  drinks guy. For the record, I'm not opposed to water at night. It just wasn't. No. I wasn't
[31:32.340 --> 31:36.520]  planning on most of those. It's just what happened to be around me in the moment. You know, I just
[31:36.520 --> 31:40.320]  don't think I, I don't think you should be allowed to have drinks at night anymore, Jeff. Like I
[31:40.320 --> 31:45.380]  think you might be done. I think this just might be a dude. I mean, the only night that I had peace
[31:45.380 --> 31:50.160]  was the night that I banned myself from taking a drink upstairs. So you might be right. I just,
[31:50.620 --> 31:57.360]  I don't want to be of an age where I can't trust myself to pick up and drink of a liquid past a
[31:57.360 --> 32:02.520]  certain time. Yeah, you might. It's hey, man, you might be there now. This might be it.
[32:03.400 --> 32:06.760]  You're everything you're describing. This might be a right now thing, dude.
[32:07.440 --> 32:12.120]  I think you need to put yourself in training. I think you need to work up to this. You need to
[32:12.120 --> 32:16.580]  relearn how to drink properly in the dark. You are coming at me with some aggression.
[32:17.040 --> 32:22.660]  It's better than what you're doing now. Yeah, that's exactly. I'm not. I don't want this for
[32:22.660 --> 32:27.800]  you, but based on what you've described, I think what you need to do is start by drinking in the
[32:27.800 --> 32:33.900]  shower at night. Yeah, I agree. I think you have to go in the shower. Yeah. If it spills on you,
[32:33.960 --> 32:39.260]  you could just shower off. You'll be fine. It's already in the bathroom. Yeah. You have to keep
[32:39.260 --> 32:43.180]  all your drinks in the shower. I think you start with the shower. I just think you need a nice
[32:43.180 --> 32:48.140]  long straw. Big, heavy cup and a long straw that goes to your mouth while you sleep. He's going
[32:48.140 --> 32:55.600]  to miss. No way. I got to be honest here, Gav. I think I like their idea more. Maybe I should only
[32:55.600 --> 33:01.060]  be able to drink in the shower because then there's an intention behind it. Because you're
[33:01.060 --> 33:06.660]  like half asleep, right? But if I have enough mental faculties to realize that I need to go
[33:06.660 --> 33:11.420]  into the special drink room, I'll be alert enough to probably drink fine in the drink room. And if
[33:11.420 --> 33:16.260]  I'm not, you're right. I can clean it up in that room right there immediately. And it's further
[33:16.260 --> 33:21.100]  away from Emily and the dog. And even if I spill it, it'll be loud as all hell if I drop a cup in
[33:21.100 --> 33:26.100]  that shower on that tile. But at least the cleanup will be faster. Yeah, exactly. You can let the dog
[33:26.100 --> 33:30.160]  in the shower with you while you drink if that helps you. No, he needs to be asleep. Okay, just
[33:30.160 --> 33:35.660]  making sure. So Andrew, as someone who drinks your bathroom water, do you ever drink the shower?
[33:36.640 --> 33:44.100]  No. Okay. Sometimes, I mean, water gets in the mouth. Whatever happens, happens. I'm not like
[33:44.100 --> 33:52.780]  mouth open. I got to refresh in the shower. Why not? Hot water is not refreshing.
[33:53.620 --> 34:00.040]  Yeah, you got hot water. I'm not a hot water guy. There are a few layers as to why I wouldn't.
[34:00.100 --> 34:05.300]  But if water ends up in my mouth and I mean, I feel like I for the most part spit it out,
[34:05.320 --> 34:08.000]  but I'm sure I've accidentally swallowed some. But you wouldn't ever just be like,
[34:08.040 --> 34:11.220]  okay, I'm done with the shower. Let me turn this to cold and just have a drink.
[34:11.220 --> 34:13.940]  No, because this is not really a convenient way to do it.
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.740]  It's like a shotgun blast to your face of water. Like, I don't, it's the spread.
[34:20.940 --> 34:25.320]  It would go everywhere. And then I'd have to re-dry myself. Like, it's just a lot everywhere.
[34:25.500 --> 34:29.380]  You're already soaking wet, though. Okay, I'm still wet. And I've just decided.
[34:29.560 --> 34:32.620]  You just had the shower. Okay. Instead of turning off the shower, you turn off the hot.
[34:32.840 --> 34:36.340]  It's cold now. Have a little drink. I think the problem is I don't want any
[34:36.340 --> 34:39.980]  other part of my body to be as cold as the inside of my mouth when drinking.
[34:40.640 --> 34:45.140]  Like your lips and cheeks and stuff. Yeah, my face. I'm going to blast myself with cold water.
[34:45.360 --> 34:49.660]  Like, even if I get 80%, that 20% is really not enjoyable.
[34:49.880 --> 34:52.320]  It's not the most efficient way to do it either. No.
[34:52.780 --> 34:55.400]  What if you had a shower funnel? You turn it to cold.
[34:55.960 --> 34:58.520]  You look up. It's all going in the funnel and it funnels into your mouth.
[34:59.060 --> 35:02.220]  That's a good idea. I mean, what you're describing would work,
[35:02.260 --> 35:04.880]  but you're like creating a device that I didn't ask for.
[35:05.420 --> 35:07.340]  You're never thirsty in the shower? No.
[35:07.820 --> 35:09.280]  Okay. I don't think I've ever been.
[35:09.280 --> 35:13.040]  That's a, you know what? That's deep, Gavin. I don't think I've ever been thirsty in the shower.
[35:14.520 --> 35:17.300]  I don't think I've ever even considered being thirsty in the shower.
[35:17.640 --> 35:21.220]  I've been thirsty in the tub plenty of times. Really?
[35:21.300 --> 35:23.380]  That's a nightmare. Well, you got a cold tap right there.
[35:23.880 --> 35:28.200]  Yeah, but it's all the way on the other side of the, I'd have to, it's a lot of work.
[35:28.440 --> 35:35.380]  Do you think if I only drink my nighttime drinks in the shower for spillage reasons
[35:35.380 --> 35:40.000]  that I will become conditioned to be thirsty in the shower or get thirsty when I see showers?
[35:40.380 --> 35:42.020]  That's interesting. That's interesting.
[35:42.840 --> 35:46.480]  I don't know. I don't think you'll do it long enough. I think like you need to trust yourself
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.040]  after like three consecutive successful shower drinks to then move into the bathroom.
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.480]  That seems pretty low given my track record, but I appreciate your...
[35:56.480 --> 36:04.180]  But you have a lifetime of not doing it. So I feel like if you're comparing on an average...
[36:04.740 --> 36:08.220]  I guess that's true. I have a bit of a recency bias, though.
[36:08.300 --> 36:14.360]  You do. It's bad. What I, the part of this story that I really enjoy that we haven't gone over yet
[36:14.360 --> 36:22.380]  is it from Emily's perspective, because I'm sure all of this happened and then the next day
[36:22.380 --> 36:28.020]  you're like, you are not going to believe what happened last night. I spilled. It was a disaster.
[36:28.140 --> 36:32.080]  I had to clean it up. I was trying to make sure you didn't wake up. It was a whole thing.
[36:32.080 --> 36:39.380]  To do that multiple nights in a row to Emily. I would have loved to have seen her face to learn
[36:39.380 --> 36:43.160]  that this happened consecutive times. Here's how that conversation went.
[36:44.980 --> 36:48.120]  The first time I did it, I said that to her and she said, oh, I heard.
[36:48.520 --> 36:54.480]  And then the second time I did it, I did it the second time I did it. I didn't mention it to her
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.160]  at all. And she said, same problem again last night, huh? Oh, that's so bad. And then the third
[37:00.160 --> 37:06.280]  last night with the punch in the soda into the bathroom, I don't think she had any idea.
[37:08.140 --> 37:14.880]  Emily rules. So funny. Hey, more drinking problems, not dipshit.
[37:16.240 --> 37:18.620]  That's kind of the energy of it.
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.620]  What if we cut a drink holder into a nightstand? That's not a bad idea.
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.640]  I like that idea. Gavin, you're back on top. I like that idea. I like the gurp lid.
[37:27.640 --> 37:32.820]  Maybe I really like the gurp lid. Instead of cutting a hole into my nightstand,
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.020]  maybe it's like a clip on cup holder. I don't trust that. I don't trust that
[37:37.020 --> 37:40.640]  for you, honestly. But we can, you know, you keep spitballing. I'm just I'm worried about
[37:40.640 --> 37:45.020]  you mostly. No, I understand. I understand. Oh, have you seen one of those really heavy mugs?
[37:45.800 --> 37:52.100]  Yeah, we should get you a near unmovable mug. Yeah. And that way there's no way you can knock
[37:52.100 --> 37:58.980]  Sort of like a mug mjolnir, if you will. Yeah, I have found a 22 pound mug.
[37:59.560 --> 38:04.700]  Yeah, let's get him a mjolnir. I would consider that. That's an interesting idea, too.
[38:04.860 --> 38:11.280]  But here's the issue, though, is he's bringing liquids there, right? Like you'd have to fill
[38:11.280 --> 38:16.320]  this thing with the intent of drinking it there. And that hasn't been the case with these spills.
[38:16.800 --> 38:20.240]  That's true. That's true. I'll just have to be a little more intentional about how I do this.
[38:20.240 --> 38:28.740]  But I think that so much of what he's doing is knocking over this thing that if we got him a
[38:28.740 --> 38:36.540]  very a mug near again, he's way less likely to knock it over. Totally. I absolutely agree with
[38:36.540 --> 38:42.240]  that. My point was just that he keeps accidentally leaving liquid in these places. And if for him to
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.160]  use this, you'd have to intentionally put liquid in that spot. So he'd have to just change his
[38:48.160 --> 38:53.200]  thinking. I have to show you guys this. Please. You know who the real loser in this whole thing
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.660]  is? I just feel so bad for and about you. No, it's not me. I mean, I'm always going to be the
[38:58.660 --> 39:06.160]  loser in my story, right? I'm the I'm the I'm the lose tag in this of all my my stories. But it's
[39:06.160 --> 39:13.660]  Emily. I've clearly yeah, I've clearly begun my decline. I'm obviously on the back nine, whether
[39:13.660 --> 39:19.000]  I want to be or not. And she's stuck with it. You know, like she got like one or two good years
[39:19.000 --> 39:27.540]  with me when we met. And then it's just a fucking steady race downhill. Yep. So I found heavy mug,
[39:27.620 --> 39:32.760]  the world's heaviest mug. It's one hundred and fifty five dollars. We save sixty five dollars.
[39:33.400 --> 39:39.660]  The image that they show is so funny. The first image. OK, cool. Backlit. Neat. It says heavy
[39:39.660 --> 39:44.160]  with an asterisk. It also kind of a regulation logo or not quite. It's more of a red hot chili
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.720]  peppers thing, but it's fine. The other one, it's on a motorcycle. Cool. The third picture,
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.340]  the one that I sent you guys, it's filled with bullets. Yeah. You guys put bullets. Is that a U.S.
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.700]  thing? It's a it's Texas thing. Yeah. Everybody has a bullet mug. I've never thought about it,
[40:01.040 --> 40:08.020]  but yeah. And also, oh, my God, dude, 22. Dude, Jeff, we got to get this heavy, heavy mug for you.
[40:08.020 --> 40:11.940]  Yeah, I'm if you guys will, if you guys buy me that mug, I'll try to use it.
[40:11.940 --> 40:17.340]  Jefferson is Yosemite Sam era. He's filling it with ammo. It's pretty cool.
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.680]  If you knock this one over, you break your toes. Is it bulletproof? Yeah. Is there anything that's
[40:22.680 --> 40:28.240]  like it's bulletproof? I don't know. There's a little video there where a guy puts it through
[40:28.240 --> 40:32.500]  a glass table because it's so heavy. And then there's also another one where they're cheersing
[40:32.500 --> 40:37.580]  with the glass mug and one with the heavy mug and the heavy mug explodes the glass mug.
[40:37.980 --> 40:43.900]  What's your nightstand made of, Jeff? Wood. OK, I think we're all right. All right. It's a pretty
[40:43.900 --> 40:49.140]  solid nightstand. I think I'm OK. Why are there ridges on Reese's peanut butter cups? Probably
[40:49.140 --> 40:54.100]  so they never slip from her hands. Could you imagine I'd lose it? Luckily, Reese's thought
[40:54.100 --> 40:59.260]  about that. Wonder what else they think about? Probably chocolate and peanut butter.

[41:15.560 --> 41:20.160]  Dude, can I tell you guys something concerning? I just looked down at my table and there was a
[41:20.160 --> 41:24.920]  little bit of blood on it. And I don't know where that blood came from. What? That's mystery blood.
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.040]  Are you all right? Where's the blood coming from? I don't know. But no, I mean, like,
[41:31.040 --> 41:37.740]  touch yourself and see. Yeah, I'm looking. No, I'm looking. I don't know where I'm bleeding from.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.440]  It would be your leg. Your leg. Wait, what do you talk? Wait, where is the blood?
[41:43.100 --> 41:46.820]  It's on. It's next to my keyboard here. I'm going to be from his leg.
[41:46.960 --> 41:49.940]  I thought this was I thought he was looking at his nightstand.
[41:51.220 --> 41:55.600]  Why would he be looking at his nightstand in the middle of a podcast? He's in his he's in the office.
[41:56.220 --> 42:00.060]  You know what? Yeah, but I record in my bedroom, so I just put everybody in my
[42:00.060 --> 42:04.060]  mind table when we're all in our bedrooms right now. So really, the mind table is the mind bedroom.
[42:04.600 --> 42:10.800]  That is a lot of blood. That's a concern. OK, Jeff, it's not just a concerning amount of blood.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.580]  It's also that it's smeared around everywhere. Yeah. Hold on. I'm wiping it off. Yeah. I don't
[42:16.580 --> 42:22.380]  know where that came from. Is it? Are your hands bleeding? I'm looking. I cut my elbow like two
[42:22.380 --> 42:27.440]  weeks ago, but I'm looking at you. So you're not even with a knife in the middle of it. That's
[42:27.440 --> 42:33.080]  yeah. That was a long time ago. It's not my elbow. Are you knife juggling right now? I don't even
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.440]  have a knife in front. OK, I don't have a knife in front of me. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.420]  where that came from. You know, I bet you if you had a big mug of bullets on your desk, that bleeding
[42:41.420 --> 42:45.740]  wouldn't have happened. Whatever happened would be scared to mess with you. That's true.
[42:46.620 --> 42:56.360]  It's a big old mug. You're a bleeder. I am a bleeder. Thanks. Yeah, I am. I over index on
[42:56.360 --> 43:02.160]  blood. Yeah, you're probably the bloodiest friend I have. I'm ready to pop at all times.
[43:03.860 --> 43:07.580]  I wish it was easier to test blood. What do you mean?
[43:07.580 --> 43:14.040]  Like crime shows. Oh, come on. That's joke of the day, right?
[43:14.960 --> 43:19.120]  I thought that was a good topical man. Topical. Thank you. Thank you.
[43:19.920 --> 43:24.480]  Oh, she the blood lady? Yeah, she's she's in prison, though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's the
[43:24.480 --> 43:30.060]  blood lady. What do you want to test blood for, Andrew? I just when you come across blood,
[43:30.080 --> 43:33.180]  sometimes it's like, I wonder where that came from. I wonder if it's even mine.
[43:33.860 --> 43:38.820]  Whose blood is this? How often are you finding random blood that could not often. But whenever
[43:38.820 --> 43:44.800]  I do, I go, huh, where did that come from? And like Jeff saying, it's not like he doesn't seem
[43:44.800 --> 43:49.040]  to know if it's his. It'd be it'd just be cool to be able to test it and go, oh, this is my blood.
[43:49.380 --> 43:53.160]  I mean, it's got to be mine because I'm the only one that sits at this desk. That's what I was
[43:53.160 --> 43:58.600]  going to say. Ever in this room. You would assume so. But you would know definitively
[43:58.600 --> 44:02.680]  if you could test it. It's true. I feel like blood that I've been surprised
[44:02.680 --> 44:06.480]  by, I always know is mine. I mean, it wasn't blood there when I sat down today.
[44:06.880 --> 44:10.700]  See, you assume it's yours because that's the rational thing to assume.
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.420]  But what if it's not? Whose blood could it be? I don't know. I feel like whenever I found blood,
[44:16.980 --> 44:22.760]  it's guaranteed mine. It would be weird if you were like had some sort of a blood leaving
[44:22.760 --> 44:26.220]  fetish where you would just like break into homes and then just like bleed a little bit and then
[44:26.220 --> 44:31.340]  leave. The DNA bandit. I don't like that. Yeah, I don't like that either. They'd catch you so fast.
[44:31.340 --> 44:35.580]  You say the DNA bandit, but you're leaving your blood behind, which bandits it's the
[44:36.300 --> 44:41.920]  opposite, right? They steal. Yeah, I feel like the DNA bandit might take blood from people,
[44:42.040 --> 44:45.860]  but then that's a vampire and he's getting into murky territory here.
[44:45.980 --> 44:48.540]  Yeah, but the wet bandits used to flood the house they robbed.
[44:50.180 --> 44:53.280]  What does that have to do with what you're saying? No, no, you're right.
[44:53.980 --> 44:58.120]  Yeah. And if this continues the argument, I'm on Gavin's side.
[45:02.240 --> 45:05.500]  Was that really a plot point of that, that they would flood the house, the wet bandits?
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.620]  Yes. That was like their whole name. That was like the thing, right? The wet bandits.
[45:09.900 --> 45:13.980]  I just I don't remember that. Why were they called the wet bandits? No idea.
[45:14.580 --> 45:21.340]  I just don't remember it. Wet bandits. It was a major subplot of the film.
[45:21.720 --> 45:25.380]  I mainly watched Home Alone when I was like six or five. I don't know.
[45:25.800 --> 45:29.140]  Didn't stick. That was not a detail that was important to me, I guess.
[45:29.140 --> 45:33.300]  Mm hmm. Terrified of mobster stuff.
[45:33.420 --> 45:39.460]  When was the last time you saw Home Alone? In its entirety, probably like 20 plus years ago.
[45:39.820 --> 45:43.920]  Oh, you got to watch it at Christmas, son. Dude, I see that movie three times a year,
[45:43.980 --> 45:46.920]  probably still to this day. I would love to watch it with you.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.340]  Clips of it a lot. Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun to watch. Great group watch.
[45:50.920 --> 45:53.820]  But it's one of those things where I get clips every once in a while. I'll go,
[45:53.940 --> 45:58.080]  I want to see some Home Alone and I'll watch some stuff and that'll kind of fill the need.
[45:58.080 --> 46:01.820]  I haven't like sat down and done a full watch. Maybe this summer we could have Christmas in
[46:01.820 --> 46:05.300]  July and we could sit down and watch Home Alone together. I love that. On the hottest day of the
[46:05.300 --> 46:13.260]  year. I mean, we could release the GTA Snowman videos we made in December and then do a Home
[46:13.260 --> 46:17.860]  Alone watch along. Can we hold the GTA Snowman videos till July and have Christmas in July
[46:17.860 --> 46:20.800]  this year and do a watch along and do some other Christmas related content? It'd be like
[46:20.800 --> 46:23.960]  forcing the whole audience to be Australian. That's great.
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.320]  Not bad. It's not bad. I like it. Eric was not on board and you just got him on, Gavin.
[46:31.320 --> 46:37.280]  You know, I was good because we keep getting hit for it. But shit, man, we just put out
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.860]  a video. We just put out GTA Deadline and somebody's like, I think this was recorded
[46:41.860 --> 46:46.320]  in June. And it's like, all right, I mean, we can hold on to Christmas videos until July if
[46:46.320 --> 46:52.600]  that's the case. So let's do it. People complaining about things being not timely. We're serving them
[46:52.600 --> 46:59.560]  timely in March. Things are getting crazy. The most timely videos. We're serving them
[46:59.560 --> 47:05.460]  timely in March. Mario Party March. Oh, I'm sorry. I just did. I thought you were talking
[47:05.460 --> 47:09.540]  about right. I didn't understand. Sorry, Andrew. I thought that was an excellent segue. 30 days
[47:09.540 --> 47:14.420]  of consecutive Mario Party. And we're releasing it essentially as we film it.
[47:14.900 --> 47:20.300]  Couldn't be more timely. Could not could not be more difficult to do. Yes, it's going to be. It's
[47:20.300 --> 47:26.220]  so. So we learned just to explain the idea fully that you can exit a game of Mario Party,
[47:26.400 --> 47:32.520]  save and then come back to that. And I pitched the idea of doing one turn at a time of the longest
[47:32.520 --> 47:37.820]  amount, the most amount of turns you can have in a game, which is 30. So for 30 consecutive days,
[47:37.840 --> 47:43.340]  we are all going to group up in the morning, play one turn of Mario Party, then save and quit
[47:43.340 --> 47:49.040]  and have to wait until the next day to continue the game. And we will be posting these daily as
[47:49.040 --> 47:55.320]  we do it. One day after. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this will be on Patreon. So check the Patreon,
[47:55.740 --> 48:01.600]  subscribe. This is where you'll be able to watch it. And it's this is. I still this is still insane.
[48:02.020 --> 48:08.060]  Like this is still crazy. We'll also put out the full video at the end. Yes. So is it free on
[48:08.060 --> 48:12.340]  Patreon or is it for members only? That's up to you guys. Yeah, I don't know. We never talked about
[48:12.340 --> 48:15.840]  that. I think it could be free. The only reason I don't want to put on YouTube is that it might
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.960]  murder the channel. It's going to absolutely murder the channel by putting up a 36 hour
[48:21.920 --> 48:28.660]  compilation of content. Also, we just had so much fun doing the advent calendar and we wanted to
[48:28.660 --> 48:33.640]  kind of have that kind of fun again in some daily way. And so I think this really scratches that
[48:33.640 --> 48:38.120]  itch. So it'll be free on the Patreon as long as you're a member, which there's a free membership.
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.300]  So just sign up for free. You can give all of your personal information to Patreon for us.
[48:43.300 --> 48:48.260]  Every day with us. And if you don't want to do that at the end of all the days, we'll release
[48:48.260 --> 48:54.380]  the full video of all the days put together on our YouTube gaming channel. I cannot wait. I am.
[48:54.760 --> 49:00.440]  It's going to be hell. There's going to be so much rage. It's such an interesting game to do like
[49:00.440 --> 49:05.640]  that as well, because there'll be potentially like when the Jamboree buddy comes down on the map and
[49:05.640 --> 49:11.060]  then we play a mini game to see who gets him. And it'll be such celebration and potentially the next
[49:11.060 --> 49:17.800]  day someone could just run past you and take him. Yes. Thinking about the game we just played,
[49:18.240 --> 49:26.040]  I had a plan laid out. I had all the pieces on turn six and by turn 12, the game and you guys
[49:26.040 --> 49:32.280]  had fucked me out of my plan. So just imagining me being so excited one night being like, oh,
[49:32.300 --> 49:39.240]  I've got everything lined up. And then each day for a consecutive week, just a phase of my plan
[49:39.240 --> 49:43.800]  getting destroyed with me not being able to do anything about it. Oh, it's going to be good.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.260]  It's going to be a lot of built up. It's interesting that we're going to have to
[49:47.260 --> 49:51.900]  set an alarm every day, even across all the weekends for a whole month.
[49:52.500 --> 49:56.260]  It's I'm so excited for this. And we've been Gavin, you and I specifically have been doing
[49:56.260 --> 50:00.700]  this kind of content together for closing on two decades now, right? Like a very long time together.
[50:01.120 --> 50:07.940]  And I get so genuinely giddy and jazzed any time there's an opportunity to do something we've never
[50:07.940 --> 50:12.620]  done before or film something in a way we've never done it before. And it's really rare that
[50:12.620 --> 50:18.520]  you get those opportunities because, you know, we've reinvented the wheel 16,000 times at this
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.240]  point. But we've never done anything like this before. And I'm so excited to see how it goes.
[50:23.280 --> 50:26.740]  And I think it's going to be miserable in all the right ways. And I just can't wait to see.
[50:27.640 --> 50:33.760]  It is a terrifying thing to take on from a production standpoint, but it is one of those
[50:33.760 --> 50:39.580]  things where once we get on the other side of it, I think learning from this process will open up a
[50:39.580 --> 50:45.660]  lot of possible fun avenues for different content ideas going forward. I mean, like the idea came
[50:45.660 --> 50:49.480]  from Andrew doing the advent calendar, which was really great because he did a really great job
[50:49.480 --> 50:53.500]  kind of producing that, putting it all together or whatever. And then we got like, oh, my gosh,
[50:53.500 --> 50:58.440]  this was so exciting because we put out something every day. Andrew prerecorded those with us.
[50:58.440 --> 51:04.740]  We batch recorded those in like a few days. We can't do that with this. We have to just get
[51:04.740 --> 51:15.720]  together every day and do this. There's so much like room for error and disaster. This is not
[51:15.720 --> 51:22.260]  good. This is not good. Speaking of error and disaster, does anybody currently have any plans
[51:22.260 --> 51:29.500]  to go out of town in March? I was. Well, not anymore. Not anymore. Yeah. OK. All right. I
[51:29.500 --> 51:37.000]  didn't either. Huh? I didn't either. Are you sure? It's possible. It's possible that might have
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.660]  changed slightly. You can do it. You just need to bring a switch and bring a microphone. What if I'm
[51:42.660 --> 51:48.220]  home? What if I'm home by eleven thirty the next morning and we can record just a few hours late
[51:48.220 --> 51:51.960]  at noon? I'm I'm I'm curious about what you mean by that, because I'm pretty sure I'm looking at
[51:51.960 --> 51:55.460]  our calendar. It's just nine a.m. every day. I know. But what if I had to push it back for a
[51:55.460 --> 51:59.440]  couple of hours just because I'm a dad and I got to be a dad? Yeah. What if I got to do that every
[51:59.440 --> 52:05.720]  Friday? Every Friday? It's going to fall apart so quickly. It's not going to fall apart. We're
[52:05.720 --> 52:09.020]  going to hold it together, but we are going to have to deal with these little roadblocks. I am
[52:09.020 --> 52:14.480]  the one that has sacrificed the time. I don't want to hear this from you guys. Yeah, I trust to wake
[52:14.480 --> 52:20.080]  up even at 7 a.m. to make content, which is like I know, like in the grand scheme of work, like that
[52:20.080 --> 52:26.920]  is so fortunate. Like I've had actual really tough jobs, like I know. Incredibly blessed. But like
[52:26.920 --> 52:32.960]  I am not a morning person. So like having to try to be on at 7 a.m. each day is going to be a little
[52:32.960 --> 52:37.520]  bit of a process. You're a morning person if it's if it's like 4 a.m. though, like you're that kind
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.380]  of morning. You do most of your you do most of your emailing and slacking at like 515.
[52:41.820 --> 52:47.000]  It's I mean, no, I'm an evening person or I'm a like I sent you guys all something today,
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  except Jeff, because you're just you're not going to be available for it. And I did that because I
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.820]  had a terrible sleep and I woke up, sent that and then went back to bed. Is it because you had to
[52:57.820 --> 53:03.700]  piss a gallon of water? No, it wasn't. Is it because you had to clean up a gallon of water that somehow
[53:03.700 --> 53:08.640]  found its way to the ground? Yeah, it was that steady. You got a crystal ball. I have a question
[53:08.640 --> 53:13.080]  about your pillow situation while we talk about you sleeping. Yeah. So you've got a lot of pillows
[53:13.080 --> 53:18.680]  because. I mean, the way I see it, it's kind of like they slip down the back of the bed, right?
[53:18.680 --> 53:24.000]  And then you just need more pillows because they keep. I've actually now I'm experimenting a little
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.640]  bit and being and being a no pillow guy. Jesus Christ. What? How do you go from eight pillows to
[53:30.640 --> 53:36.120]  no pillows? You're going to snap your neck in half. This is. So COVID really screwed me up
[53:36.120 --> 53:42.660]  from like my sleep patterns. I need to sleep upright now or at least I was so like I spent
[53:42.660 --> 53:48.720]  so long having to do that. It feels unnatural not to do that now. So I've been experimenting
[53:48.720 --> 53:59.580]  with just using the wall as my pillow and sleeping that way. I. I need to buy a ticket to Vancouver
[53:59.580 --> 54:05.060]  Island. I got to I got to watch you sleep. That's all right. Can can we buy you a headboard?
[54:05.520 --> 54:09.800]  That would be really nice. I'll install it. Like if you'll let me come up, you'll let Gavin and I
[54:09.800 --> 54:15.020]  come up. Yeah, you can get pillowed headboards. We'll buy a headboard in the Naimo and we'll come
[54:15.020 --> 54:21.760]  set it up for you. I have. So last December, I bought a new bed frame that has a headboard
[54:21.760 --> 54:28.640]  that's part of it, but it's too heavy to carry up all the stairs. So it's still there. So I've had
[54:28.640 --> 54:33.780]  this. Wait, how long has it been there? Last December. Not the the sorry, not the previous
[54:33.780 --> 54:40.320]  December we had the December before. Twenty twenty three. Twenty twenty. Yeah. You just need
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.880]  somebody to help you move a headboard for. Call me, dude. It's really heavy. I mean, dude, I have
[54:45.880 --> 54:56.960]  so much time in March to travel now. How did the bed get up there? Uh, yeah, you know what? Here's
[54:56.960 --> 55:03.280]  the the like getting the bed up there was kind of like, oh, that's that's all we had. That's all we
[55:03.280 --> 55:09.640]  got. What? And that's all you had in you. Yeah. I'm still recovering from getting the bed up.
[55:09.680 --> 55:16.320]  That was heavy. It's a big bed. Twenty twenty three. Yeah, it's. We're still we're trying to
[55:16.320 --> 55:21.380]  get the confidence together, the morale to get the the bed frame. Get it. Get it together. Get
[55:21.380 --> 55:27.820]  your bed. Get your frickin headboard up there. I'm getting it up. I have to. We want to get
[55:27.820 --> 55:34.160]  into the specifics of this. We we have some stuff we need to move around. And I also still have like
[55:34.160 --> 55:40.020]  four broken chairs that are just taking up space from out there. So we're going to have somebody
[55:40.020 --> 55:43.900]  come in to take those away because those have to go to the dump, which is a different process.
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.800]  Weren't they all on the balcony there? I think I might have one on the balcony. What was the
[55:48.800 --> 55:54.940]  broken thing on the balcony? I have two broken chairs in the bedroom right now. One of them
[55:54.940 --> 56:01.060]  is the half chair, which I turned into like a table of sorts. And then my Herman Miller is
[56:01.060 --> 56:10.660]  and I have a walk in closet and it's in there. Why do you keep all this junk? No, because it's
[56:10.660 --> 56:15.520]  tough to get rid of the chairs. I actively want to get rid of it. It's just they're heavy. They're
[56:15.520 --> 56:19.440]  bulky and they have to go to a specific place. Well, for a start, the Herman Miller, you can
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.820]  almost certainly get swapped under warranty. That is what I yeah. So that has been the one where it's
[56:24.820 --> 56:29.020]  I need to keep this because I need to figure out the warranty or I was looking into replacing the
[56:29.020 --> 56:34.420]  seat myself. I think I could do that. But the other chairs are like just completely broken.
[56:34.520 --> 56:41.120]  So I need to get rid of those, create a lot more space. I love the way you have to work up to just
[56:42.240 --> 56:50.220]  regular tasks. If you'll if you'll let Gavin and I or some some contingent of regulation come up
[56:50.220 --> 56:57.900]  and spend three days with you, we can revolutionize your life. We can make things so much easier and
[56:57.900 --> 57:02.440]  simpler for you. First of all, always welcome to come up. Second of all, I'm in the process of that
[57:02.440 --> 57:08.740]  right now. Very excited. OK, OK. I look forward to hearing more about that in the coming episodes.
[57:09.240 --> 57:12.700]  Oh, it's going to be soon. Next few weeks. Where is it downstairs?
[57:13.340 --> 57:16.740]  It's as soon as you walk in the front door. It's just in the entryway.
[57:16.740 --> 57:22.260]  Are you not sick of looking at it? No. It's just a box. It's a cardboard box.
[57:22.720 --> 57:27.200]  OK, we're definitely going to box that for a year. I don't see it often.
[57:27.520 --> 57:30.920]  We can't come in March. And I've got something in the front. It's late April.
[57:31.120 --> 57:34.740]  It's going to be set up before the end, before March.
[57:35.060 --> 57:40.260]  If that headboard... I'm going to tell you right now, Andrew, as one of your best friends on Earth,
[57:40.440 --> 57:45.280]  I tell you this with peace and love. If that headboard is in your hallway on your first floor
[57:45.280 --> 57:49.880]  by the third week of April, you will not be able to stop me from coming up and installing it for you.
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.140]  It's just not going to happen. If you don't get it taken care of before then, it will be handled by me.
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.720]  Here's my only concern. When I bought it, I ordered it off of Amazon.
[57:59.620 --> 58:03.260]  And I saw some of the reviews said that they were missing parts from it.
[58:03.760 --> 58:06.020]  So I'm a little concerned about that. That's the only hurdle I have.
[58:06.860 --> 58:09.520]  I assume there's a hardware store in Canada.
[58:09.840 --> 58:11.540]  You've been concerned about it since 2023?
[58:12.180 --> 58:13.840]  It's been a thought since 2023.
[58:13.840 --> 58:17.340]  It's going to be hard to return it if it's missing parts at this point.
[58:17.440 --> 58:19.560]  Why don't you open it and find out when you can still return it?
[58:19.860 --> 58:21.160]  Then I'd get parts everywhere.
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.920]  Well, not all of them. I got bit like this one time, Andrew, when we were back in my old house
[58:27.920 --> 58:34.100]  in my previous life, right? We were redoing the living room for some reason and we bought a sofa
[58:34.100 --> 58:38.500]  and it came shrink-wrapped together and we couldn't unshrink-wrap it and put it together
[58:38.500 --> 58:42.340]  because the house was all in a jumble, right? So it ended up just kind of sitting there and
[58:42.760 --> 58:48.800]  became part of a project that took months and months to finish and it just kept getting
[58:48.800 --> 58:53.740]  pushed from room to room. And at some point, we finally unwrapped, opened up the sofa
[58:53.740 --> 59:01.400]  and it was cracked in half and it was too late to return it because we'd passed the
[59:01.400 --> 59:05.320]  window to return it. And I just bought a $1,800 sofa that was broken. I had to throw away.
[59:05.880 --> 59:09.780]  So open and check for the parts sooner than later, I guess would be my...
[59:09.780 --> 59:13.660]  Yeah, and if it was a large investment, I definitely would be more on top of it.
[59:13.860 --> 59:16.920]  I got it pretty cheap, so not as much of a concern.
[59:17.080 --> 59:17.880]  Is it soft?
[59:18.380 --> 59:19.660]  Is what soft? The...
[59:19.660 --> 59:20.320]  Headboard.
[59:20.580 --> 59:24.160]  I have no idea. I don't even remember what it looks like fully, to be honest.
[59:24.500 --> 59:27.260]  Why were you talking about that? We were talking about getting a new, like, a pillowed one.
[59:27.900 --> 59:28.140]  Yeah.
[59:28.300 --> 59:29.140]  So you can sleep upright.
[59:30.060 --> 59:31.160]  Yeah, like, mine's soft.
[59:31.160 --> 59:35.740]  Oh, I guess I brought it up because that was the solution to the problem I had.
[59:35.940 --> 59:38.440]  And I've had it. I just haven't been able to implement it.
[59:38.440 --> 59:39.720]  How would that be the solution?
[59:40.200 --> 59:43.520]  Because one of my issues is that the bed moves from the wall.
[59:43.960 --> 59:47.480]  And so by having a headboard, the wall comes with me.
[59:48.020 --> 59:50.120]  Can I make a new prediction for 2025?
[59:50.960 --> 59:51.420]  Of course.
[59:52.060 --> 59:53.260]  Andrew breaks his headboard.
[59:53.600 --> 59:55.580]  No, that's pretty good. That's a good prediction.
[59:56.280 --> 59:59.840]  If you constantly are pushing your bed away from the wall,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.660]  you're going to snap that headboard off.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.340]  I guess it's possible, but we'll see.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:12.300]  Now, that's it. That's it. That's not to derail us here, but that's an interesting idea.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.460]  Should we have a mid-season check-in like in around June or July or August?
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:16.780]  Yeah, sure.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.460]  Can we see how our predictions are going?
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.820]  And then maybe everybody gets to make one more prediction.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.760]  Oh, yeah, I like that.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]  Like a mid-year prediction.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.360]  What if it was like a 10-second long thing and I just said, y'all still married?
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.480]  And then we just moved on.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.160]  So is it that you can't fall asleep lying down?
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.180]  Or you actually have to sleep upright?
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:44.160]  It's just something where like when I had to sleep upright because I got so sick
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.900]  and I couldn't breathe otherwise.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:46.500]  Yeah.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.720]  And now just nothing else feels natural.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.100]  So I just have to sit up.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.540]  Because I wonder if you could start sleeping set up and then we could get a bed that just
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.320]  lowers you down after you fall asleep.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.960]  That naturally kind of happens.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.860]  And then I end up slumping down.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.300]  I end up, yes, sliding down naturally.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.240]  How do you try and fall asleep?
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.600]  Bow up right there?
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.160]  I close my eyes.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.840]  What's relaxing about that enough to like drop off?
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.680]  I don't know.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.200]  I had like it doesn't bother me.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.220]  I just sit upright.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.380]  That's really impressive.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.980]  Oh, holy shit.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.100]  Are you OK?
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.580]  I just got I just got news.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:29.340]  San Antonio Spurs announced Victor Wim Binyama will miss the rest of the season with a blood clot.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.940]  Dude, did you?
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.280]  That's what I was going to sign off with this and say, hey, Nick, check this out.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.580]  And then send this picture.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.240]  Dude.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:38.800]  Yep.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.220]  Hey, Spurs tickets should be pretty cheap.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.120]  Blood clots are fucking career enders.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.800]  Like, no joke.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.640]  That ended Chris Bosh's career.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.140]  Yep.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.820]  That's not a thing you fuck around with.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.440]  It's in his shoulder.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.680]  God, that sucks.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.600]  That sucks for Nick.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:58.220]  What's scary is that really super athletic people get blood clots.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:58.500]  And this.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.060]  Yeah.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:01:59.760]  Yeah.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.280]  That sucks for Wimby.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.040]  I know we're getting a little bit long.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.580]  I have a clip.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.380]  I really want to play.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.420]  I have something very exciting to bring to this.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.500]  This is an old clip we've been talking about history.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.920]  I think there are probably people that listen to the show that weren't even around for this era.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:21.660]  But you may remember way back in the past, we once had a pencil trial on this show that
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.440]  went very well.
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.920]  Everybody loved it.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.440]  And we had a whole thing between it was myself against Jeff and Gavin over whether I needed
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.100]  to eat this pencil or not.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:43.940]  And Eric found a website that called Hired Judge, which I became a judge on and people
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.820]  could give rulings.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:51.080]  So first, I'm going to I'm going to play this clip related to that and then you'll find
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:51.400]  out why.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.600]  Hello, this is Shaheen Davari.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.280]  I'm from Hired Judge.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.240]  I also was an attorney for three years and went to law school.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:07.620]  And so I'd like to start by saying at the very top that it is patently obvious to anybody
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:14.220]  who both listens to the podcast and understands the scenario that Andrew should, in fact,
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.280]  have to eat a pencil.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:20.140]  First, he made the agreement and made the bet.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.440]  And I want to say that up top because there was some type of backtracking that Andrew
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.220]  was trying to pretend that truth isn't truth and it wasn't really him.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.160]  But truth is truth, my friend.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.020]  It was clearly your voice and it was recorded.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.280]  And that evidence definitely weighed heavily on the decision here today.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:46.560]  Second, the crackpot legal defense team did not do their job enough to get paid.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.900]  So I really hope that you did not pay these people saying that you didn't properly define
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:59.180]  a term in the contract isn't necessary in oral agreement contract.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.140]  And it's not a necessary in contracts.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:08.040]  What's necessary in a contract is an understanding between the parties as to what the pencil is.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.460]  You both understood what you meant by pencil.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.320]  No lead.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.380]  You don't want any lead.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.420]  You don't want someone to get poisoned.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.120]  Graphite pencils are perfectly harmless to eat in very small amounts, meaning one pencil.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:25.940]  And so, um, buck up and, uh, eat the fucking pencil.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.180]  This is in favor.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.020]  And now, OK, so you're reminding us that you welched on the bet again.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.320]  You're bringing this all to the forefront again.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.760]  I'm so excited for whatever turn this is about to take.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.360]  That is an aside.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.880]  You're crazy.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.560]  No, no, no, no.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.140]  You're going to understand in a minute.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.300]  This is crazy.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.140]  Gene Davari, honorable man.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.540]  He is competing on Survivor this season.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.240]  What?
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.460]  A contestant.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.580]  No way!
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:59.880]  Shaheen Davari, the guy that was a judge in my pencil ruling is a cast member
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:04.260]  on this upcoming season of Survivor that starts next week.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.240]  What?
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:09.060]  Did you just see the cast list and be like, I recognize that name.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.240]  Somebody on, I don't remember where, and I tried to find them brought up
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.440]  that this was a thing.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.960]  And I went, there's no fucking way that that's true.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.140]  And then I confirmed it and I could not find whoever's comment it was.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.780]  Thank you so much, whoever commented and made this connection.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.460]  I went back and I listened and then I looked into this.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.200]  Same guy.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.320]  The pencil judge is on Survivor this season.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.040]  It's such a shame he didn't put that as his occupation.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.820]  Yeah, pencil judge.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.400]  I haven't watched the last two seasons of Survivor.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.020]  I couldn't be more into this season of Survivor.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.860]  I gotta see how, I feel like we're team Shaheen.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.160]  You've missed out, dude.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.900]  This last season of Survivor was one of the best.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:48.740]  It was so good.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.580]  I don't watch Survivor.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.040]  I might have to watch Survivor.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.140]  I think we gotta be locked in on this.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.100]  I think we gotta, we should do a little watch party and cheer for him.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240]  And I'll stop watching it as soon as he gets voted off.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:01.700]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.900]  I'll do all of that, but continue watching it.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.100]  I cannot wait.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.040]  This is so Andrew.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.200]  This is crazy.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.040]  Insane.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.380]  Oh my God.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.480]  I can't imagine.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.040]  Imagine if he's like a Russell Hance-like villain.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.080]  I'm like, oh, there's so many.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:16.920]  I have no idea.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.460]  We're going to find out.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.740]  I cannot wait.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.640]  And I wish him the best of luck.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.780]  We have one degree of separation from Survivor.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.020]  Yeah, it's not like he's on some dog shit show that none of us have heard of.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.660]  He's on Survivor, which you talk about all the time.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.660]  One of my favorite shows growing up, and I've only recently sort of fallen off of,
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.720]  but I'm back on.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:36.920]  Fully invested.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.140]  Let me ask you this, and then we can start wrapping up here in just a minute.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.060]  He's going to be on this, but he ruled against you, Andrew.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.540]  He said that you need to eat the pencil.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.140]  Do you think that that's going to sort of shade the way that you see him
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.340]  as he makes decisions throughout the season?
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.820]  Such a great question, Eric.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.960]  And that was as immediately confronted with,
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.780]  do I want him to win or should I be actively cheering against him?
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.220]  And it ultimately came to...
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.340]  He was always in the right on the ruling.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.100]  The ruling was the right call.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.840]  It would be insane for me to be against him
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.760]  because he was right.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.020]  I was being a shit in that scenario.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.780]  And I feel like just further being a shit is not the answer.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.320]  So I'm fully on his team.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:20.940]  Wow.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.440]  Cheering for Gene.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.980]  I can't wait.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.760]  I cannot wait to watch this season.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.860]  We got a regulation contestant.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:28.240]  Yep.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.140]  Dude, we're Daivari heads.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.100]  I love this.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.460]  I think if he wins, you got to eat the pencil.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.340]  Yeah.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.320]  I agree.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.180]  Yeah.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.160]  I'm glad that you guys have a consensus.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:40.860]  That's awesome.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.400]  That's great.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.460]  I did.
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:49.540]  You know, one of us did predict it would happen in 2025 in the Nostradamus draft.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.280]  So yeah, very interesting.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.080]  Suck down some of that plum bum.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.840]  I just had to share that.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.580]  I'm so excited.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.260]  And oh, that's phenomenal.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.200]  That is unbelievable.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.240]  What a crazy coincidence.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.100]  Also, please do me a favor and watch the last season of Survivor.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.700]  I will.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.400]  I will get there.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.320]  Yes, I promise.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.840]  The one before, I don't care about.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.840]  But this last one, I'll watch it.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.180]  Oh, should we should we fuck off?
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.860]  You should wrap up because you have to go.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.900]  Don't you have to get on a flight or something?
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:20.860]  I do.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.200]  I'm leaving here to go to the airport.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.700]  He's trying to get all of his travel in before March hits.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:30.840]  The one tiny trip, one tiny trip in March that I immediately booked after I agreed not
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.820]  to go on any trips in March.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.040]  You know, when you told us about this trip and you were like, obviously, I've mentioned
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.180]  this months ago, but it's coming up and I just want to remind everyone that I'm out
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:39.980]  of town on Thursday.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.980]  That was the first time you told us, right?
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:42.980]  No, I don't think so.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.140]  I think I put it in the in the slack the second it happened.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.520]  Here's what we're going to have to do.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:52.440]  Unfortunately, we're going to have to pay for slack to see if Jeff let us know or not.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.480]  And either way, I win.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.040]  Either we pay for slack and I'm wrong and I get a paid for slack or we pay for slack
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.300]  and I'm right and I get a paid for slack.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.420]  What are you going to do with a paid for slack?
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:03.400]  I don't know.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.100]  Argue better.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.560]  Scroll back.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.840]  You think you let us know before December?
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.340]  Help Nick find that file he's looking for.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:12.600]  Yeah.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:17.780]  So wait, if you have to scroll that far back in slack, you let us know like three months
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.020]  ago?
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.080]  I would assume so.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.700]  Yeah, it's been planned for a very long time.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.320]  OK.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.140]  All right.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.460]  We'll have to we'll take a look.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.040]  We got to get paid for slack and then we'll do it.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.220]  Can you host your own slack server or do you have to pay him?
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.580]  I don't know how it works.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.260]  I think you probably have to pay him.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:31.700]  I assume.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.680]  I don't know.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:33.840]  Assholes.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.600]  It all exists on their server.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.980]  They just have locked it away from us.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:37.520]  Yes.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:38.300]  Yeah.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.800]  I believe that's how it works.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:40.520]  Yep.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.260]  If you have a better solution, I'd love it.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.720]  But that's what we're locked in with right now.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.640]  We'll find out next time, potentially.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.060]  Did we pay for the slack?
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:49.640]  Did we not?
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.520]  Tune in next week.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.320]  Do we have nitro?
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.320]  I do.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:53.680]  Yeah.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.700]  Why do I have it?
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:57.140]  Yeah, where's mine?
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.420]  I pay for it personally.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.000]  Yeah, I don't care if you have nitro.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:00.560]  I don't give a shit.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:01.680]  Could I have nitro?
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.380]  No.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:02.840]  Yeah, me.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.580]  You have a fucking company credit card.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:05.600]  I use it.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.480]  Yeah, I'm not going to use it without talking to you guys.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.740]  I'm going to just stop buying shit.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.220]  Oh, well, that makes, that makes, that makes sense.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.840]  I think it's the premise of how do you have nitro?
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.080]  I paid for it.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.380]  I just paid for it.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.400]  You can pay for it.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.060]  No, I was asking like...
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.620]  I know, I know, dumbass.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.500]  I'm saying...
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.600]  You're the one that asked!
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.080]  Did Eric give it to you?
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.520]  And I was going to kick off about it.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.200]  Well, I know that now, don't I?
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.980]  I don't have a company card.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:27.760]  I wasn't...
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.080]  Wait, what?
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.380]  Nick doesn't have a company card.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.300]  I wasn't saying physically how do you have it.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.280]  Like what, what was...
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.180]  If anybody legitimately wants a company card, I can get one issued for you.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.440]  Why does Nick have one?
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.260]  Why does he need one?
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.740]  Why does, why do you need one?
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.600]  Why did I give you one?
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.200]  I don't even know.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.420]  To buy games that we play?
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.840]  Yeah, just give yours to Nick.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.220]  Yeah, just give yours to Nick and then he'll have one.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.420]  I used it for buying a domain.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.720]  Considering that when I got a company card for Let's Play,
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.920]  I was told explicitly you two could not be trusted with them.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.100]  The fact that you both just have them.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.680]  Well, I told them when we worked at Rooster Teeth,
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.440]  I told them upfront that I wasn't going to do any reporting for it.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.760]  And they said, OK, we won't give you one.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.340]  And I said, fine.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.180]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.840]  Because I knew I wouldn't, I knew that it would annoy them.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.440]  It would annoy me.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.440]  I might as well just not have one.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.720]  Can I tell you guys something funny?
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:19.740]  I was going through like old mail the other day and just like cleaning up my house.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.720]  And I found a letter from American Express that I had just never opened.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.780]  And I opened it up and it was my new credit card from Rooster Teeth.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.500]  I guess I had just never noticed and activated my final Rooster Teeth American Express card.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.540]  It's pretty cool.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.840]  Perfect time to activate it.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.860]  Yeah, I did not activate it.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.100]  Do you think it works if you did?
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.400]  I do not think it works.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.400]  I don't think there's anything it's tied to anymore.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.520]  They finally, they finally killed my email access three weeks ago.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.060]  I'm sure that the credit cards went away a long time ago.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.020]  What if it's just linked directly to the Warner Media account?
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.960]  Then you'd be committing some sort of illegal activity by using it, I would assume.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.580]  What if it's just Bernie's now?
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.720]  Yeah, just charge it against him, it's fine.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:10.860]  That's funny.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:11.360]  Yep.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.300]  Okay, let's wrap this up.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.680]  Should we really fuck off this time?
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.120]  Wait, where'd the blood come from?
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:17.800]  Where'd the blood come from?
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.020]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.160]  There's no more.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:21.600]  Sweet.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:22.560]  I don't know.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.060]  There's no more?
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.500]  There's no more blood.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.240]  I forgot about it.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:25.800]  I don't see it.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.560]  Let's wrap up, I guess.
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:27.280]  All right.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.540]  Well, there you go.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:33.860]  You have now listened to the 40... what episode was this?
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.140]  Second?
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:34.460]  No, no, no.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.200]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.120]  42nd episode of the Regulation Podcast from start to finish, I assume.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.780]  It would be weird if you just fast forwarded to this part.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.080]  Although, hey, man, whatever floats your boat.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:48.260]  I'm not here to yuck your yum, as the young kids say these days.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.400]  Thanks for listening.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.360]  I know, it's the worst, right?
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.720]  It's not collab bad, but it's up there.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.100]  Thanks for listening to another episode.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.540]  I hope it was entertaining for you.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.800]  It was certainly something on our end.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.380]  And we'd appreciate it if you'd let somebody in your life know about the Regulation Podcast.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:10.540]  Maybe a friend, family member, co-worker, doctor, accountant, advisor,
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:17.100]  maybe your HR department, old teacher, maybe a childhood friend,
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.840]  maybe a childhood bully that you're trying to reconnect with.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.180]  Maybe somebody that you need to make a lifelong apology to.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.440]  Maybe somebody that you've had a crush on your entire life.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.460]  Can you please end this so you can go to the fucking airport?
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.720]  Maybe it's just Eric. I don't know.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.260]  But let somebody know.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.300]  If you wouldn't mind, we'd appreciate it.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:36.460]  And we'll be here next week saying the same dumb shit.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.780]  I imagine Gavin's balls will come up at some point.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.260]  So you don't want to miss that.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:41.140]  Bye bye.
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.040]  Eric left.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:43.960]  Yeah, he did.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.140]  What is this, a face?
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.460]  First practice is almost here.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.460]  Gear up on budget when you shop quality used sports equipment at Play It Again Sports.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.520]  Plus, get paid on the spot for outgrown items.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:05.380]  It's the sustainable way to shop and sell for football, soccer, golf, hockey, and more.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.540]  Play It Again Sports. Your back-to-school go-to.
