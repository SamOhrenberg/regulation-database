[00:00.560 --> 00:07.640]  Hey, it's Paris. You know I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and
[00:07.640 --> 00:14.300]  AutoCamp, I just slept under them. Picture me, serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious
[00:14.300 --> 00:21.460]  Airstream, making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors
[00:21.460 --> 00:28.980]  meets Hilton hospitality. That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for
[00:28.980 --> 00:35.340]  the stay. Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast. This is episode 18. My
[00:35.340 --> 00:40.820]  name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[00:40.980 --> 00:48.240]  I have missed you all. Been a couple weeks. I missed you too. To the audience is nothing but
[00:48.240 --> 00:55.880]  to us. Oh god, it's been so hard too. We've talked about the FOMO of missing out on work recordings,
[00:55.880 --> 01:01.680]  and you guys have been prolific since I've been gone. Every once in a while, I'll hop on your
[01:01.680 --> 01:07.540]  Discord and I'll be like, oh, you guys recorded seven heist videos today. Oh, that's cool. Oh,
[01:07.580 --> 01:13.820]  you guys recorded a whole new show that looks really fun. That sounds awesome. Meanwhile,
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.900]  I've been fucking coughing up a lung somewhere in middle America. What did I miss? You missed
[01:21.900 --> 01:30.320]  something. You sent me a recording piece of equipment, Jeff. Yeah. And it has created a
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.580]  new problem that has displayed itself for the first time when we were recording. A recording
[01:35.580 --> 01:40.980]  piece of equipment. Yeah. Is that not correct? That's just very vague. I'm trying to imagine
[01:40.980 --> 01:47.300]  what it would be. It's a GoXLR. GoXLR, I say? Yeah, the GoXLR. It's a recording piece of
[01:47.300 --> 01:50.920]  equipment. I didn't know we had to get into the specifics. I didn't know we were getting
[01:50.920 --> 01:56.120]  into the technical terms on everything here. I think you nailed it. It caused a new problem
[01:56.120 --> 02:04.660]  where with the GoXLR, I can hear myself now in my headphones. And I realized we're playing
[02:04.660 --> 02:12.280]  something. Gavin and I got into a playful debate, an argument about something. And I was yelling at
[02:12.280 --> 02:19.020]  Gavin. And because I could hear myself through my own ears, I couldn't hear him when he started
[02:19.020 --> 02:25.300]  yelling at me halfway through. And I didn't want to stop finishing my point, but I needed to also
[02:25.300 --> 02:30.020]  communicate that I couldn't hear Gavin. And I couldn't process why. This is the first time this
[02:30.020 --> 02:35.020]  has happened within the moment through the yelling. And so it just turned into me saying,
[02:35.260 --> 02:40.940]  I can't hear you. I'm talking over you. I can't hear you. It was like I was a little kid doing
[02:40.940 --> 02:46.520]  the na-na-na-na-na, but I literally couldn't hear Gavin over my own yelling. I was interrupting my
[02:46.520 --> 02:52.220]  ears and being able to hear his counterpoint. Until now, at no point have you heard your own...
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.840]  No. Huh. Well, that explains why you never know if you're loud or quiet.
[02:58.360 --> 03:05.180]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, now I can. Initially, I hated it. It hasn't fixed it. He still doesn't
[03:05.180 --> 03:08.020]  know when he's loud or quiet. You have to ask him to turn it up all the time.
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.180]  Well, I was about to crank it all the way, but I didn't. What was the argument about?
[03:15.140 --> 03:20.120]  Uh, what was it? You were... We finished a heist and we needed Lester to call in,
[03:20.180 --> 03:24.820]  so I loaded... I thought we could do a fun activity to try to initiate it. Oh, and you
[03:24.820 --> 03:29.900]  just were not happy about that. We were doing this activity and you were suggesting stuff.
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.380]  He just kept saying, why are we doing this? What is this? Why are we doing this?
[03:35.420 --> 03:42.560]  Over is so much. It was so great. It was the longest mission. We had to drive across the
[03:42.560 --> 03:49.960]  whole map twice. It was awful. I can't... I can't handle... I can't handle... I can't
[03:49.960 --> 03:56.680]  handle Andrew being in charge of anything. It's mental. The decisions you make, absolutely insane.
[03:57.160 --> 04:03.520]  No, that was a valid decision. Gavin had a fix of, we should do a gang war. And then I said,
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.260]  where's the gang war? And he said, I don't know. The gang attacks are on the map.
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.360]  Right, but you've seen that that's his usual solution. It is. Where it's like,
[04:14.460 --> 04:19.300]  I'm helping you. Your audio is bad. I'm helping you. Yes. Yeah, but a lot of the time it's like,
[04:19.320 --> 04:24.440]  hey, why didn't you put it on hard again? It's on easy still. And I don't have a solution other
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.400]  than restart the whole thing. I don't have a solution. You're right. Jeff, there are so many
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.080]  times where we start a mission and we have the lives and we go, did he fucking, is it on normal?
[04:34.460 --> 04:39.380]  And we're like, put it on hard. And Andrew went, yeah, I got to do that. Yeah, you're right.
[04:39.460 --> 04:45.340]  That's it. And he just goes, yep, I'm accountable on that one. That was, we're recording. I was
[04:45.340 --> 04:51.020]  sleepy. It was the first thing we recorded that day. I forgot to flip it. That was a mistake by
[04:51.020 --> 04:57.380]  me. But it was hard the rest of the way. That's not a great combination of words, but it was.
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.800]  I nailed it every other point, but I did screw up that first one. There's been quite,
[05:02.800 --> 05:08.520]  quite a lot of stuff has happened between, um, not only, uh, have we released our smut,
[05:09.200 --> 05:14.780]  but I won a draft for the first time. You did. Congratulations. Very excited about that.
[05:15.320 --> 05:19.920]  Violence or whatever. Popping hydrants. What draft did you win? Oh, the summer draft.
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.880]  Congratulations. You won the summer activities with, uh, what was it? With popping a hydrant
[05:24.880 --> 05:28.300]  and violent crime. I think you have to pop a hydrant to celebrate your win.
[05:28.800 --> 05:31.800]  Bunting? Was that one of your things? That was what, that was an honorable mention.
[05:32.380 --> 05:36.840]  Dude, I was in, uh, like I said, in middle America this summer a lot. And, uh, there's so much
[05:36.840 --> 05:41.700]  bunting dude. Michigan has, Michigan and Illinois have so much bunting. I thought about you constantly.
[05:42.660 --> 05:46.620]  That's great. Everywhere I went. Love to see a bit of bunting. I will say though, I do have to
[05:46.620 --> 05:52.300]  make a formal apology. Um, I was complaining at the beginning of that draft, which is on Patreon.
[05:52.300 --> 05:57.160]  I think it's a, is it an extra medium or a bog standard draft? And I'm not sure off the top of
[05:57.160 --> 06:03.360]  my head. It's one of those. But I made, I kicked him a fuss about how, uh, we record Eric's screen
[06:03.360 --> 06:09.760]  and I wanted him to get nitro. So it recorded a higher resolution version of it. Uh, just so it's,
[06:09.780 --> 06:14.540]  it's bigger on the screen and you know, we can crop in and all that. But then Nick decided,
[06:14.680 --> 06:20.600]  you know what? Forget that. I'll just record it myself. And then, uh, didn't crop it at all.
[06:20.600 --> 06:25.820]  It's absolutely tiny. Uh, if your phone is in that orientation, you can't read shit.
[06:27.060 --> 06:35.060]  Invalidating. Why did he say oh? I get it now. You can crop.
[06:36.520 --> 06:44.840]  It takes up, it takes up like 40% of the screen. Maybe less.
[06:45.800 --> 06:52.880]  What? Well, since then I've learned. Disagree. Was the issue that he was recording his own
[06:52.880 --> 06:56.660]  perspective and not Eric's taking advantage of it or just the lack of crop? Well, the benefit
[06:56.660 --> 07:00.000]  to recording his own perspective is that it doesn't need to be streamed at any resolution.
[07:00.180 --> 07:03.840]  It's his native screen size capture. But he's not cropping. Right. And sometimes
[07:03.840 --> 07:09.760]  he says, I'm going to do that. And then what happens? He decides I'm not going to do that,
[07:10.060 --> 07:14.820]  but no one is informed. And so the screen changes and now it's an issue. You found out. Yeah. Nick's
[07:14.820 --> 07:22.980]  started quiet quitting on his recordings. Even better than cropping, you could just
[07:22.980 --> 07:27.900]  do like a control scroll wheel and make it big. Yeah. Yeah. That would have been a good idea.
[07:28.160 --> 07:32.140]  You're right. Yeah. So this is Jeff. This is what it sounded like when we kept telling Andrew he
[07:32.140 --> 07:37.600]  needs to put it on hard. It was just a guy agreeing with us and we couldn't like there's
[07:37.600 --> 07:43.160]  nothing you can do about it. You just keep going. OK, cool. There are times where you fuck up and
[07:43.160 --> 07:46.680]  it's just like there's no point arguing. You're right. Like everything you're saying is correct.
[07:46.880 --> 07:53.060]  I should have put it on hard. I was wrong. I intended to. It turns out. Speaking of arguing,
[07:53.220 --> 08:00.680]  can I? And it was sort of brought up just a second ago. The smut came out and Clutch My Pearls did
[08:00.680 --> 08:06.800]  a great review of both of you looking like fucking goons on this couch that I had to crop in on your
[08:06.800 --> 08:12.460]  faces to help my wife edit. OK. Two time authors. OK, cool. All right. So you are the authors.
[08:12.460 --> 08:20.860]  That's great, because I need to speak to you about a character. Global X. No, there's a character
[08:20.860 --> 08:31.440]  that is. It's a Badoorian. No, no, no. See, Gavin, I knew this was going to fucking happen.
[08:31.620 --> 08:38.260]  We tried to explain this to your small wife and it's we worked backwards from the language. We
[08:38.260 --> 08:42.380]  developed the language and we translated it back to English. And it's just how it came out.
[08:42.460 --> 08:47.020]  And you're saying it wrong. First of all, that's not how it's pronounced.
[08:47.540 --> 08:50.420]  Uh huh. And how is it pronounced? Gavin can say it better than I can.
[08:50.660 --> 08:57.780]  The Badoorian. Badoorian. It's nothing like. And what kind of alien creature is it?
[08:58.080 --> 09:00.340]  Like a little cum slurping gremlin rat.
[09:04.020 --> 09:09.400]  Yeah, it's a little. You can read it right here. Do not be afraid. Do not be repulsed. It is
[09:09.400 --> 09:15.440]  merely a Badoorian, an alien cum cleaner. Think of him as a dirty little parasite,
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.960]  a necessary evil. He cleans for us. He is of no danger to you, for he is weak and cum addicted.
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.060]  The Badoorian is. That reminds me, we recorded another Ratatouille part as well. That was fun.
[09:28.100 --> 09:31.680]  We did. We played Ratatouille. We made Jeff watch us play Ratatouille for an hour.
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.580]  And more than more than half of it is Andrew on one level trying to jump on bread.
[09:36.580 --> 09:43.100]  It's so bad. It's so fun. Anyway, I was in Austin for 36 hours and that's what I got to do.
[09:44.420 --> 09:52.160]  We debuted our smut, which is called Celestial Glorbosis of Peace and Poimals. We debuted it on
[09:52.160 --> 10:01.500]  the Clutch My Pearls podcast and it got more views than our own podcast. Yeah. Yeah.
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.500]  Yeah. I don't know if I like that. I'm not happy
[10:06.500 --> 10:12.940]  about it. It is number four in science fiction erotica on Kindle Unlimited. Jeff said,
[10:13.060 --> 10:16.960]  congratulations, we're number one. And we said, wow, you're number one. And he said, no.
[10:18.660 --> 10:27.060]  I misspoke. I can't tell you how uncomfortable I was in that recording for some reason. I can see
[10:27.060 --> 10:30.960]  how uncomfortable you were. Well, I was trying not to make too much noise, but I was cracking
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.700]  up. And also I was just dealing with all the embarrassment of having all this stuff read
[10:35.700 --> 10:41.280]  to the point where I got heartburn and my chest was hurting and I felt ill for like two hours
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.020]  afterwards. And then you can see me experience some of the worst embarrassment I've ever felt
[10:47.020 --> 10:52.240]  when I go into this big spiel about, you know, it all started with the Poimals. And as soon as I say
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.980]  it, I realized we forgot to write about the Poimals. I don't know what happened to it,
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.160]  like whether we just cut it or we forgot to write it. But now I feel like that was the core of the
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.520]  story. And then I'm spewing on like it and then they're like, wait, what was that? And I was like,
[11:07.540 --> 11:11.740]  oh my God, we forgot it. And I just died of embarrassment. Can I ask, did you just do a
[11:11.740 --> 11:17.180]  word replacement for Poimals and you missed the one at the very front because it had a space between
[11:17.180 --> 11:22.520]  the P and the Oimals? Nah, that's just a weird formatting thing. We decided to keep that because
[11:22.520 --> 11:28.740]  we like it. But no, I think what happened is in the initial, we wrote this in two sessions,
[11:28.740 --> 11:32.680]  once in New York City and then once in Austin. And in the New York City session,
[11:32.820 --> 11:38.960]  we wrote in the Poimals thing and somehow it just didn't make it from New York back to Austin.
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.060]  I don't know. And then we just missed it. There was so much else to focus on.
[11:44.020 --> 11:49.980]  There's a lot going on in the story that we just missed it. But I think that's great. It adds to
[11:49.980 --> 11:56.860]  the mystique because based on how successful this thing is, based on how much demand there is for
[11:56.860 --> 12:02.820]  it, we clearly have to revisit the universe in some fashion and dive into the Poimals. I will
[12:02.820 --> 12:09.020]  say, I saw something that I thought was fucking brilliant. Somebody took Andrew's hot dog ladder
[12:09.020 --> 12:13.660]  that he created and cut it in half. Do you see that on the subreddit? And drew it and then said
[12:13.660 --> 12:19.860]  if you cut it in half and just use half hot dogs on the top, it looks like the hot dog has Poimals.
[12:20.260 --> 12:25.400]  And I got to thinking, maybe there's something there. Like maybe we design a Poimal hot dog.
[12:25.400 --> 12:31.100]  I don't want to be in Poimals. I don't know. If they're all be franks, you might.
[12:31.620 --> 12:34.840]  And my understanding is they don't really exist in whatever you wrote. So
[12:34.840 --> 12:37.900]  they do. They kind of be anything. You know what I mean? They've been alluded to.
[12:39.220 --> 12:42.940]  Oh, cool. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's like a lot of subtext in this thing, I guess.
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.300]  Oh, for sure. Kind of like Jace Hammercock is the author or pen name, but it also exists in
[12:48.300 --> 12:55.360]  the universe as a as a character. You really excuse the phrase you you blew your load so early
[12:55.360 --> 13:02.380]  on this thing where you the line that I included here, her boobs were the size of large boobs.
[13:02.520 --> 13:09.860]  The biggest kind is the funniest line ever written. It's not strong. Thank you very much.
[13:09.900 --> 13:16.840]  I'm very proud of that. Oh, wow. I just love the idea of reading a novel and it not making any
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.180]  sense because the author forgot like subplots that they were establishing because they wrote
[13:21.180 --> 13:26.680]  in chunks. So I can't believe how embarrassed I got when I. Oh, I can believe what I realized
[13:26.680 --> 13:31.220]  in the moment that we just forgot that. You can you can go watch it. You should go watch Clutch
[13:31.220 --> 13:36.680]  My Pearls. You can listen to the podcast, but the video version of that has Jeff and Gavin on screen
[13:36.680 --> 13:44.360]  the whole time. And Gavin is squirming, squirming. Jeff is like laughing so much of it, like he's
[13:44.360 --> 13:51.760]  reveling in it. Gavin is squirming. Oh, I was so. Everybody else is so uncomfortable and I am so
[13:51.760 --> 13:58.100]  exceptionally comfortable. I like that you're mostly just mouthing along. I'm like Will Smith
[13:58.100 --> 14:03.820]  in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. They also had to massively crop our shot because I accidentally,
[14:04.440 --> 14:09.860]  I guess we recorded portrait, but I had my legs crossed in a way that it was like mainly aimed
[14:09.860 --> 14:15.960]  at my undercarriage. Like you can see my pasty pale underlap where my breakfast is almost hanging
[14:15.960 --> 14:21.720]  out. My wife came to me and went, what am I supposed to do with this footage? And then I went,
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.660]  what do you mean? She's like, I need them to be on screen, but I don't know how to make this work.
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.320]  And she showed me your raw footage. And I went, oh, what the fuck it is. It's like looking at
[14:33.320 --> 14:44.200]  Gavin's ass from the front. It's so fucking weird. It's so weird. It's oh boy. I think it
[14:44.200 --> 14:50.540]  affected the auto exposure. Like the ring light was just blasting off my pasty underlay and it
[14:50.540 --> 14:58.560]  just changed the exposure of the whole frame. Well, if you're interested in our smut, you can go
[14:58.560 --> 15:05.140]  listen to the review on the Clutch My Pearls podcast, or you can watch the review on their
[15:05.140 --> 15:11.000]  YouTube channel. If you want to read it for yourself, clearly you can do that. It is free.
[15:11.120 --> 15:17.600]  I made it free on Amazon, Kindle, Unlimited, whatever the fuck that is. But if you don't
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.580]  have that, then you do have to pay $2.99 for it, which is as cheap as it would legally let me make
[15:22.580 --> 15:29.240]  it. So we tried to reduce the barrier to entry as much as possible. But if you liked it and you
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.560]  want to write a review, or if you disliked it and want to write a review, we appreciate your honesty
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.860]  and your feedback. You can help us get to number three on the list of most popular sci-fi erotica.
[15:38.220 --> 15:42.620]  Yeah, we can get to number one, which is number three. Eric, how did you find out about the
[15:44.220 --> 15:47.020]  Baudourian? God, I wanted it to be out of your mouth when you read it.
[15:47.920 --> 15:51.480]  That was really close. That was really close to not being how you said it the first time,
[15:51.480 --> 15:59.200]  but that's okay. I saw the post on the subreddit and had a feeling that there was something that
[15:59.200 --> 16:05.140]  was up, wasn't sure what it was, and then quickly learned about all of that. So pretty cool. Pretty
[16:05.140 --> 16:12.080]  cool. I think it's interesting that you choose to identify with an animal described as a little
[16:12.080 --> 16:16.740]  alien rat gremlin. That has my full name spelled in it, yeah. Harry with beady eyes and jagged
[16:16.740 --> 16:21.100]  feet. The opposite of the gorgeous and statuesque beauty of the globulians.
[16:21.880 --> 16:27.580]  I don't think of you in that way at all. When you changed Gavalina's spelling,
[16:27.740 --> 16:31.680]  was that on purpose or on accident? Wait, what? We'll never tell.
[16:36.520 --> 16:45.700]  Geniuses. The two responses of one guy not knowing where it's at and the other guy going,
[16:45.700 --> 16:51.980]  oh fuck, we'll never tell. That's our little secret. Maybe there's a reason for it. There's
[16:51.980 --> 16:56.980]  a lot of subtext, a lot of easter eggs, a lot of fun stuff in this story. A lot of fan service,
[16:57.160 --> 17:02.400]  if you will. I'm curious if there are any other authors who started with a cookbook and then went
[17:02.400 --> 17:07.580]  into smut for their second writing journey. I mean, isn't that what that Court of Thorns thing
[17:07.580 --> 17:12.160]  is? Didn't she start writing a teenage book and then by the fourth book she discovered sex and
[17:12.160 --> 17:18.340]  just became porn? Yeah, but a cookbook is a completely different, that's an odd transition
[17:18.340 --> 17:25.720]  from cookbook to smut. I think I'm most proud of working in the Swiss army knife from Germany.
[17:28.540 --> 17:31.860]  I'm excited to read it. I haven't read it yet. Oh, you haven't read it? Nick, have you read it?
[17:31.860 --> 17:36.520]  No, I haven't. Oh, wow. They're not gonna fucking read it, dude. It's like nobody was gonna read
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.280]  Heather's book in Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, even though they all go to the parties and
[17:40.280 --> 17:44.320]  drink the free wine, do the readings, but they're not paying attention. I was about to say that.
[17:45.060 --> 17:50.020]  You posted a photo, Geoff, is this the Poymal dog? Yeah, somebody said Andrew unintentionally
[17:50.020 --> 17:56.180]  created the Poymal dog and so he drew it. I will say, I was against it at first, that looks like
[17:56.180 --> 18:04.480]  a steamboat to me. I'm kind of all about it. A steamboat dog? It's a hot dog with three halves
[18:04.480 --> 18:10.160]  attached to the top. Would that not be better with mini buns on the, uh... Oh, Gavin.
[18:10.520 --> 18:17.820]  Like little life jackets. Yeah, life jackets. I like that a lot. I do too. If I eat that dog,
[18:17.940 --> 18:22.460]  if I make and eat that dog, have I eaten four dogs? No, we've gone over this. This would, by
[18:22.460 --> 18:26.840]  letter of the law, that would be one dog. Okay, even if they were in the individual mini bun
[18:27.540 --> 18:33.520]  situation hot dog? I think, I think it would, I think you're making like a Voltron. Yeah. Yeah,
[18:33.520 --> 18:38.200]  it just becomes something other than a hot dog at that point, you know? That's fair. Becomes a,
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.960]  what is it? A, a, a, uh... Poymal? Yeah. I was gonna say porpoise, but I know that, that's not
[18:44.960 --> 18:51.300]  right. Not a porpoise. Poymals and porpoises are nothing in common. No, nothing alike. Except for
[18:51.300 --> 18:58.860]  blowholes. Yeah? They both got blowholes? Kind of. I'll have to read the spot. The secretion
[18:58.860 --> 19:06.140]  comes from somewhere. I don't like, secretion is just not a great word. Not a fan. If we were
[19:06.140 --> 19:11.100]  gonna do a draft of least appealing words, secretion to me is on the board. That'd be a
[19:11.100 --> 19:15.960]  good draft. That is a good draft. Oh. I feel like people would be racing towards moist, but I think
[19:15.960 --> 19:21.220]  moist is a lot less bad than people make out. Secretion is so much worse than moist. Well,
[19:21.260 --> 19:27.800]  I think moist is about as bad as it gets. Really? No, because moist, moist, there are other contexts
[19:27.800 --> 19:35.420]  for it. Secretion is never good. Moist is how you, that's how jockage starts. I feel like moist
[19:35.420 --> 19:41.320]  isn't as bad as like, pustule. Oh, pustule is pretty fucking gross. That would be on my list,
[19:41.380 --> 19:55.720]  I think. Pustule. Well, there you go. A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[19:55.720 --> 20:01.520]  especially these days. Eight different settings, adjustable intensity, plus it's heated,
[20:01.820 --> 20:08.160]  and it just feels so good. Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[20:08.480 --> 20:15.920]  but when it can come with a car, suddenly it seems quite practical. The all-new 2025 Volkswagen
[20:15.920 --> 20:21.960]  Tiguan, packed with premium features like available massaging front seats, it only feels extravagant.
[20:22.920 --> 20:27.620]  Today's top story, the flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter Group and
[20:27.620 --> 20:32.860]  Chocolaty Corp. Joining me is a PBC executive. Thanks for having me, Barry. Now, how did you
[20:32.860 --> 20:37.180]  know the merger and the byproduct of it, Jif Peanut Butter and Chocolate Flavored Spread,
[20:37.360 --> 20:43.120]  would be a success? You know, it was a gut feeling, a rumbling, if you will. Besides,
[20:43.540 --> 20:49.380]  they're two titans of taste. Very true. Goes great with pretzels. And pancakes. Apples too, I bet.
[20:49.380 --> 20:59.140]  Try Jif PBC today. Do you want to hear my idea that's going to annoy Eric? Yeah, I'd love to. I
[20:59.140 --> 21:03.740]  wasn't sure if you did a little trick by like blaming Nick. I thought we were going into Eric
[21:03.740 --> 21:10.080]  territory earlier. Yeah, good trick. It might not annoy you. You might be into this idea. Okay. Is
[21:10.080 --> 21:17.940]  it a me as we? I was thinking about how amazing it was when we played Pico Park and how Eric was
[21:17.940 --> 21:21.720]  getting all annoyed playing Pico Park. And then, you know, the second one's coming out.
[21:22.220 --> 21:28.020]  I was thinking of ways we can involve the community. And I thought, what if we put
[21:28.020 --> 21:35.360]  eight community members in Pico Park, but they can't talk to each other. They can only talk to
[21:35.360 --> 21:42.060]  Eric. And Eric has to just organize. I don't want to talk to them. Can they just listen to me?
[21:42.820 --> 21:49.660]  No, because you need to hear their feedback, too. Why would I want their feedback? I'm not in a
[21:49.660 --> 21:54.740]  company with them. Someone might have an issue with what you're asking them to do. They might
[21:54.740 --> 22:00.760]  not be able to do it. They might need to have a word. And then you managing them all the way
[22:00.760 --> 22:07.020]  through a level, I think would be just brilliant content. I think that has to be like the reverse
[22:07.020 --> 22:13.360]  Patreon, where we pay them to go through that experience. You need to pay me to go through this
[22:13.360 --> 22:19.720]  experience. What are you talking about? What do you think? It's ridiculous. I love it. What? So,
[22:20.760 --> 22:26.180]  so I have to play it with them? No, you're not even in it. You're just managing. Oh,
[22:26.240 --> 22:31.320]  the go between. This is even worse. They can't talk to each other. It's better for you because
[22:31.320 --> 22:38.600]  you're not playing. So you want me to coach what they should do? Yeah, but just coach. You're not
[22:38.600 --> 22:42.420]  a player coach. You're not, uh, you know, you're not Charlie Hustle here. You're just, you're just
[22:42.420 --> 22:46.380]  coaching. I think if you're in the game, it's too easy to say, look at what I'm doing. Do this
[22:46.380 --> 22:51.260]  sort of thing. And we would follow what I say. We wouldn't want that. Yeah.
[22:53.840 --> 22:58.200]  I think they can figure it out. I don't think they would need Eric's coaching. Now, here's
[22:58.200 --> 23:03.500]  the thing. This might have to be a Falcon tier thing. Cause there has to be a barrier of entry
[23:03.500 --> 23:11.340]  to this. Cause if we just grab anyone, I will fucking flip. What do you mean by anyone? Like
[23:11.340 --> 23:16.560]  somebody doesn't know us? No, no. Like anyone who just comes in, they're like, I'm going to do it.
[23:16.620 --> 23:22.880]  I don't trust them. I don't trust people that are just going to jump on it. This has to be like
[23:22.880 --> 23:30.520]  or something. This is insane. This is so crazy. This is insane. Ideally it would be eight people
[23:30.520 --> 23:35.620]  who have never played the game. Oh my God. Could we like provide them free copies of the game?
[23:36.100 --> 23:40.900]  Oh yeah. We should do that. Yeah. So they don't have to buy it or anything. Sign up to be a
[23:40.900 --> 23:46.720]  Falcon, I guess. Cause we're going to figure something out. This is, this is the there. Oh
[23:46.720 --> 23:51.680]  no. Please don't do this before I get back in town. I promise I won't leave town again after
[23:51.680 --> 23:55.900]  this last trip. All right. But if you do leave town again, that's when we're doing it. I don't
[23:55.900 --> 24:04.360]  want to miss it. I don't. Oh man. I don't know. This might be my Gavin's Clutch by Pearl spot
[24:04.360 --> 24:08.460]  experience for me. I don't think I'd want to be there. I think I'd find it so uncomfortable.
[24:08.880 --> 24:12.980]  I think this is what I'd want to hear about later. I'd want to watch it later.
[24:13.400 --> 24:16.300]  I agree with you, Andrew. I also don't want to be there.
[24:17.440 --> 24:21.300]  Well, then you better lead them through quickly so it can be over fast. What if,
[24:21.440 --> 24:24.480]  what if Gavin had a team and Eric had a team and it was like a race?
[24:26.020 --> 24:33.220]  Now we're thinking Andrew, we're starting to put some stuff together. This is pretty good.
[24:33.440 --> 24:40.720]  Both are coaches. Yeah. Very interesting. Very interesting. Gavin thought I'm the runs.
[24:41.920 --> 24:45.500]  What if Andrew has to coach everyone as well? I don't mind.
[24:46.920 --> 24:52.440]  No, I think Andrew, Andrew is already involved in the community so much. I just don't think,
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.040]  you know, that's fine. I think me and you two teams of four, we kind of like figure this thing
[24:57.040 --> 25:03.320]  out. Like what if we had like competing teams on the same game? Here's the thing with me,
[25:03.360 --> 25:08.140]  my team would quit on me. So I'm fine with it. I'd be chill. I'd be relaxed. They'd be
[25:08.140 --> 25:12.140]  the frustrated ones. I just feel like, oh, you got to do this. So I'm not worried about it.
[25:12.260 --> 25:15.780]  I'd love to do it. If you want me part of it, I'm all for it. But I think, I mean,
[25:15.780 --> 25:20.520]  I was just hoping it'd be like one of the live streams. I know that seems like a terrible idea.
[25:20.620 --> 25:23.200]  Well, yeah, I mean, if, yeah, if you want to do that on one of the live streams, Gavin,
[25:23.300 --> 25:26.540]  let's do it. Me and you, buddy. No, you can't do both. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no,
[25:26.560 --> 25:30.420]  we can both have two teams of four. We can figure this out. Oh, yeah. No, I think we
[25:30.420 --> 25:35.340]  can definitely do this, dude. Yeah, me and you. This definitely, this definitely got more
[25:35.340 --> 25:39.640]  intriguing. Yeah, right. Definitely. I didn't expect that to, I didn't expect that to turn
[25:39.640 --> 25:47.000]  back on either, but I'm so glad that it did. That's like when you threw, it's like when we
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.640]  threw that cup of water into the wind, we were on the boat in Australia and it was right back
[25:51.640 --> 25:57.880]  in our face. I really, I feel like Pika Park wouldn't be that bad for at least the earlier
[25:57.880 --> 26:04.420]  levels. Trying to do something like that with like Tetris or like Tower Fall, trying to like
[26:04.420 --> 26:09.020]  explain. Well, that now that would be different. That'd be infuriating. Falcons play Pokemon.
[26:10.860 --> 26:17.860]  Falcons play Pokemon. I bet you a lot of the Falcons do play Pokemon. If we surveyed the
[26:17.860 --> 26:22.100]  Falcons, I bet you it's probably like 70 percent of play. I think there's an idea here. I think
[26:22.100 --> 26:26.660]  we need to investigate how we can best do this. But Gavin, what great thinking and what even
[26:26.660 --> 26:32.200]  better thinking from Andrew. This is fantastic. Oh, thanks, Andrew. You're welcome. Oh, Gav,
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.520]  I have a I have something for you, buddy. Your gift came in from the recording that I did with
[26:37.520 --> 26:45.200]  you and Andrew. Oh, remember what was that we had? Was it a Gears video? I can't spoil it,
[26:45.260 --> 26:50.300]  though, can we? Oh, I don't know how to talk about it. Oh, I get. Yeah, that's that's upcoming. Oh,
[26:50.320 --> 26:52.560]  I guess we just won't talk about that. Well, anyway, I need to get it to you.
[26:53.940 --> 26:58.660]  And congratulations on being a good little boy. And you got it. And Andrew already got his.
[26:58.660 --> 27:04.220]  I was able to say to him and I had so much fun doing it that I've decided that that's going to
[27:04.220 --> 27:11.600]  be a part of regulation now that I will use to motivate all members of the company at various
[27:11.600 --> 27:17.740]  points in the future. And I think it'll the effects thus far have been stellar. And so I
[27:17.740 --> 27:22.580]  want to keep I want to keep rolling with it. So to give, I guess, Eric and Nick some context,
[27:22.580 --> 27:29.360]  but keeping it very vague, we did something and Jeff said, if we complete this thing and this
[27:29.360 --> 27:36.660]  attempt, then you guys will get vinyls. And then Gavin and I did it. And then it was followed by
[27:36.660 --> 27:41.580]  Jeff frustratingly being like, how the fuck did you guys do it on that run? God damn it.
[27:41.840 --> 27:48.160]  What am I going to get? Everything is so expensive. It was like the 36th attempt. And so I was like,
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.060]  I'll buy you guys both vinyl. I'll buy you guys both LPs since you both are talking about records.
[27:53.740 --> 27:57.960]  And they fucking if I was like, if you do it on this attempt, and they did it. So then I had
[27:57.960 --> 28:02.420]  to go buy them fucking records. Records cost a lot of money. I didn't realize. I mean, I've been
[28:02.420 --> 28:06.940]  buying them used for a while. I didn't realize how much new records cost. So it was an expensive
[28:06.940 --> 28:12.500]  proposition, but it clearly motivated them to succeed. And I got me thinking about how many
[28:12.500 --> 28:17.680]  records are out there that I could acquire that I could use as bargaining chips going forward to get
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.200]  you guys to do things. Think of things like gold stars on a board, you know, when you work towards
[28:22.200 --> 28:31.580]  the pizza party. You found a positive reinforcement works? Yeah, yeah, yeah. On incentives, it's a
[28:31.580 --> 28:37.540]  slippery slope. Got to be careful with incentives. Don't always work. They backfire often. When do
[28:37.540 --> 28:43.860]  they backfire? I think like typically people will find exploits to get the thing as quickly as
[28:43.860 --> 28:48.460]  possible. Andrew's Andrew's trying to think it through to see how he can get the most out of
[28:48.460 --> 28:54.760]  this and going, Jeff, you better be careful with all these people. I think he just means himself.
[28:55.040 --> 29:01.680]  Yeah, yeah, gotcha. I think of all the members of this company, Eric is the hardest to incentivize.
[29:02.160 --> 29:09.120]  Well, I just want it if it's if it's like for content and something strong that does not hurt
[29:09.120 --> 29:15.080]  me mentally or physically, I'm pretty for it. I know how to get another way to Eric's heart.
[29:15.220 --> 29:19.320]  You just got to be like, Eric, if you do it on this attempt, single origin coffee.
[29:20.280 --> 29:25.460]  I'm like, I'm fucking done. So fucking throw a bag of Barrett's at him. They'll get anything
[29:26.780 --> 29:32.900]  bag of Barrett's throw a bag of Barrett's at the Bedorian. Great. Thanks, man. First off,
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.260]  that's the ballot dowry. And I think it's who you're referring to. And that is not you. I wish
[29:37.260 --> 29:44.420]  you would stop trying to hone in on that. And like, it was different universes when you wrote
[29:44.420 --> 29:48.880]  it. Did you have to look up how to spell my name so that way it was right? Or did you get it on
[29:48.880 --> 29:57.440]  the first try? I'll never tell. I will say I didn't just get a vinyl from you, Jeff, for my
[29:57.440 --> 30:04.240]  birthday. You and Emily sent me a wonderful bouquet of flowers and some chocolate and it came with a
[30:04.240 --> 30:10.100]  balloon. And that balloon has become the pinnacle of my entertainment since my birthday. I just
[30:10.100 --> 30:20.860]  posted a photo of it. It's been inhaled. It has been drifting around the bedroom ever since I got
[30:20.860 --> 30:28.100]  it. And it's just a game of like the DVD screen of it bouncing around the corners just with the fans
[30:28.100 --> 30:35.080]  I have in the room and the air conditioning. It slides all over the place and it is a delight to
[30:35.080 --> 30:41.120]  watch. I've spent an embarrassingly long amount of time laying in bed just watching the balloon
[30:41.120 --> 30:48.160]  drift from area to area of the roof. It's a great time. That's where it's currently located. I'm so
[30:48.160 --> 30:53.320]  glad that you've got so much use out of it. That's better than I could have ever expected. It's
[30:53.320 --> 30:59.120]  brought a lot of entertainment. I've had to cut part of the plastic from it below because the
[30:59.120 --> 31:04.400]  weight is pulling it down. I've had to modify it to keep it going. But I'm having a great time with
[31:04.400 --> 31:09.000]  this balloon that's just floating around. I'd highly recommend adding a helium balloon to your
[31:09.000 --> 31:15.440]  workspace if you can. Extract maximum value out of the thing. That's awesome. Yeah. For the amount
[31:15.440 --> 31:21.140]  like dollars of entertainment. Can I send you guys a picture of something I saw? Please! When I was
[31:21.140 --> 31:26.180]  in my travels, I was in Chicago for a little bit. And one of the days I was there, I had nothing to
[31:26.180 --> 31:32.540]  do. And so I rented an e-bike and I decided I'd just ride my bike up and down Lakeshore Boulevard,
[31:32.640 --> 31:39.340]  I guess, where the beach in Lake Michigan is, on the edge of Chicago. Which was a lot of riding.
[31:39.440 --> 31:45.280]  We were about 40 miles. But as I was riding by, I ran across this. Which is one of the coolest
[31:45.280 --> 31:50.640]  things I've ever seen. This is what motherfuckers in Chicago do for fun. They
[31:51.620 --> 31:59.700]  just carried out this heavy ass, six foot tall vert ramp. And they had a couple of little old
[31:59.700 --> 32:07.000]  BMXs. And they were just jumping BMXs into Lake Michigan. And then the person in the water would
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.740]  just like hold on to the BMX. They would throw a rope to them. They would hook it on the bike.
[32:10.780 --> 32:14.860]  And they would drag it back in. And then somebody else would jump it. And they were just doing that
[32:14.860 --> 32:20.460]  all Saturday. It was like Tuesday. All Tuesday long. And I rode by. And when I came back by,
[32:20.460 --> 32:25.100]  maybe three hours later, they just were all carrying the fucking heavy ass ramp to their
[32:25.100 --> 32:30.160]  truck to drive away. It was just their fucking morning. So you're telling me after over a decade
[32:30.160 --> 32:33.400]  of playing GTA, and you were on a bike, you didn't think, I'm going to hit that?
[32:33.920 --> 32:40.480]  Dude, I was on a fucking Uber e-bike that weighed about 200 pounds. I did think briefly of like
[32:40.480 --> 32:44.320]  stopping. I stopped to take the photo. And then I felt awkward. But I did think briefly about
[32:44.320 --> 32:50.440]  stopping and going over there and being like, let me get a run. But I'm like a 49 year old dude.
[32:51.260 --> 32:55.260]  20 people that all clearly know each other that are doing something that they're constantly doing.
[32:55.420 --> 32:59.840]  You know, I'm not going to invite myself to their party. So I decided to enjoy from a distance.
[33:01.440 --> 33:07.040]  But I was like, these are my kind of people. Like, this is what I want to get in on. This is what I
[33:07.040 --> 33:12.120]  want to be involved in. I'm imagining you walking up to them and being like, hey, listen, I know
[33:12.120 --> 33:16.800]  a thing or two about bike jumps. Give me that. Dude, I guarantee you I could do some fun shit
[33:16.800 --> 33:22.020]  off that. Are you kidding? Oh, I could do a front flip off that, I think. Oh, yeah. What?
[33:22.300 --> 33:26.540]  Do you think the vertness though makes it harder to get? I'd be worried I'd just go straight up.
[33:27.100 --> 33:30.820]  Yeah, you're going to go very up. It's pretty easy. You'd need to like lean over the handlebars
[33:30.820 --> 33:34.040]  to get in the water, I think. Yeah, you're not going to get very deep for sure. You're not
[33:34.040 --> 33:38.800]  going to go out far. You're getting more height than distance. Can you believe this wasn't on
[33:38.800 --> 33:45.080]  any of our summer activities list? Oh, it's the only activity on my summer activities list going
[33:45.080 --> 33:49.240]  forward now. And I just was like, I bet this is just like, dude, you just do this all day long
[33:49.800 --> 33:56.140]  in fucking Chicago. What a cool place. You framed it very satisfyingly with the ramp leading up to
[33:56.140 --> 34:01.760]  that building. Totally unintentional. I was just holding my bike with one hand and trying to
[34:01.760 --> 34:08.160]  take a photo without looking like an idiot with my other. It looks like if I tried to make a trials
[34:08.160 --> 34:14.700]  level, like I figure out enough to put one ramp down and get frustrated and save and quit. Like
[34:14.700 --> 34:19.580]  someone just experimenting with the level maker getting bored immediately. Dude, I thought I had
[34:19.580 --> 34:27.600]  fun on a bike. I am... I'm missing out. Well, have you considered being a ramp guy?
[34:28.740 --> 34:33.640]  Yeah, of course. You could just get a ramp and then just like drive and put ramp. It'd be fun to
[34:33.640 --> 34:37.760]  get a ramp and just put it down somewhere and see what happens. I mean, the culvert had a little
[34:37.760 --> 34:43.840]  ramp, didn't it? Yeah, I need to be a ramp in the water guy. I'm looking for that water landing. I
[34:43.840 --> 34:53.320]  don't need the 49 years of old body compressing with the force of the gravity. Maybe that's the
[34:53.320 --> 35:01.180]  next bike stunt. I like that. I like that. Can we find a spot in Lady Bird Lake that isn't full of
[35:01.180 --> 35:07.700]  algae that will eat your brain? We can find a spot. There's water. There's other water in Texas.
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.300]  We'll find something. I wonder if you got that ramp, put it down somewhere and then just observed
[35:13.300 --> 35:18.400]  how long it would take to see someone use it. How long would it take for you to get sued?
[35:21.500 --> 35:24.660]  Would I get sued for doing that? Suddenly it's like,
[35:24.700 --> 35:26.680]  who's fucking ramp is this? My kid broke his arm. And you're like,
[35:27.380 --> 35:33.160]  what if we nobody's ramp there? And then like every 10 meters leading back from the ramp is
[35:33.160 --> 35:39.760]  just the same waiver. Yeah, it's so funny. These guys weren't signing waivers or anything. It was
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.740]  wild. I guess they signed them before they got there. You have to like drive it through paint.
[35:45.200 --> 35:50.880]  And that's the NDA. Like the tread. Tread leading to the ramp. Yeah, you sign with your tire on the
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.400]  way up to the ramp. That's great. It's like how we autograph baseballs. Anyway, I thought we got
[35:56.400 --> 36:00.800]  up to some fun stuff, but we we're missing out. Chicago's got us beat. I would definitely try
[36:00.800 --> 36:05.000]  that. If I if I was able to borrow one of the BMXs, I would definitely do that. I don't. I
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.280]  disagree. Hell yeah, dude. You disagree that I would do it? Yeah, I don't. That doesn't strike
[36:10.280 --> 36:16.900]  me as a Gavin thing at all. You're crazy. You think I don't? I don't know. Maybe because in
[36:16.900 --> 36:22.160]  slow-mo guys, you know, you're never the guy in the line of fire. I just I find I find it hard to
[36:22.160 --> 36:29.580]  believe you would hit that ramp on a BMX. Hmm. I think nerves get in the way. I think you talk
[36:29.580 --> 36:34.580]  yourself out of it. Ah, you know, Andrew does bring up a good point. You do talk yourself out
[36:34.580 --> 36:39.740]  of stuff when it goes from theory to practice sometimes. But I feel like you would do it. I feel
[36:39.740 --> 36:46.180]  like you would be you would feel. You would feel safe with the water. Yeah, I don't think I'd get
[36:46.180 --> 36:51.420]  hurt. I would love to see you do it. You brought up the great point of how vertical the ramp is.
[36:51.460 --> 36:55.400]  You'd have to really be pushing forward. I feel like that could get in your head.
[36:56.660 --> 37:01.680]  Yeah, I think I'd be most worried about falling off as I hit the ramp and just like slamming
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.880]  the ramp with my face. That would be unfortunate. But yeah, let's set this up. I'll do it. I'll
[37:07.880 --> 37:13.140]  preview. All right. We got to figure this out. This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino
[37:13.140 --> 37:18.260]  blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love. Now topped
[37:18.260 --> 37:23.620]  with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam available for a limited time. Your
[37:23.620 --> 37:29.300]  Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks. This episode is brought to you by State Farm.

[37:47.160 --> 37:49.020]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[37:52.860 --> 37:57.280]  Hey, can I send you guys one other photo? Yeah, of course. I want to ask you guys a question.
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.680]  Oh, I'm excited. A couple weeks ago, before I went out of town, I went out to dinner with
[38:01.680 --> 38:06.380]  Millie. We had a little like, you know, she's leaving for college. We were having like our
[38:06.380 --> 38:12.300]  some goodbye dinners and stuff. And we went to this like kind of like Korean barbecue place.
[38:12.640 --> 38:23.240]  And they had this, which is cornbread shaped like fish. Whoa. I've seen the fish before.
[38:23.780 --> 38:27.260]  I didn't know it was cornbread. It's cornbread, but it's like in the shape of a fish.
[38:27.280 --> 38:31.120]  And, you know, I'm not big on fish, right? And I saw it and I was like, I don't really want to eat
[38:31.800 --> 38:35.260]  fish looking cornbread either. But then I was like, it's just cornbread, right? I'll just eat it. And
[38:35.260 --> 38:37.920]  it was fucking delicious. And that butter right there, that honey butter, whatever it was,
[38:38.100 --> 38:43.500]  was unbelievable. And I was sitting there eating this cornbread, this fish cornbread and thinking,
[38:43.940 --> 38:51.640]  I wonder how much fish cornbread I would have to eat before I could trick myself into liking fish,
[38:51.820 --> 38:57.060]  which got me thinking, could you trick yourself into eating a food that you don't like by eating
[38:57.060 --> 39:03.080]  other food that's shaped to look like it? Like eventually, would it wear you down subconsciously
[39:03.080 --> 39:06.600]  where you would suddenly like fish without even realizing it because you've been eating fish
[39:06.600 --> 39:11.460]  shaped and fish looking things forever? Like if I only ate gummy fish or whatever for like a month,
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.920]  would fish start to look appealing to me at the end? Or if I ate a bunch more cornbread fish,
[39:16.980 --> 39:21.120]  would at some point a filet of fish actually look appealing? Do you think you could eat a cornbread
[39:21.120 --> 39:30.290]  jar of mayo? No. But maybe if you found something that made more sense with the mayo,
[39:30.450 --> 39:34.690]  it could trick me. You know what I mean? I like cornbread, so I'm not eating fish,
[39:34.730 --> 39:40.370]  I'm eating cornbread. But if I ate enough, you know, fish looking cornbread,
[39:40.850 --> 39:46.930]  would eventually I just start to like fish? I think you could over like 10 fish cornbreads,
[39:46.930 --> 39:53.250]  you could just start sneaking in bits of fish until you're eating fish. Oh, I don't know about
[39:53.250 --> 39:57.970]  that. Fish and cornbread would be a weird combination, I think. But I do think that I
[39:57.970 --> 40:01.950]  could like, you know, you could trick it like if maybe the next time I ate a steak, I cut it to
[40:01.950 --> 40:08.250]  look like a fish, you know? And you just keep fish shaping stuff until eventually you're eating fish
[40:08.250 --> 40:15.990]  you don't even realize. See, for me, the cornbread is more like disguising it. Because I have a
[40:15.990 --> 40:21.050]  similar feeling about mayo, Jeff. I hate mayo unless I don't know it's there as established.
[40:21.150 --> 40:27.550]  I need to be secret mayo and then I enjoy it. Or fancy mayo, which is aioli. I need one of those
[40:27.550 --> 40:36.250]  two. So if you could like Trojan horse the fish, I guess, in this example in some way by coating it
[40:36.250 --> 40:40.910]  or maybe I almost need the opposite of this where I need it to appear to be something it isn't as
[40:40.910 --> 40:46.230]  opposed to a more delicious version of what it appears to be. Like you need a fish that looks
[40:46.230 --> 40:54.290]  like a Cheez-It or something. Yeah, exactly. Can you make fish jerky? Yeah. That sounds horrendous
[40:54.290 --> 41:00.110]  to me. Salmon jerky exists. Oh, wow. I've never had that. Yeah, I think. I gotta google that.
[41:00.370 --> 41:08.190]  I think it does. Salmon is a very jerky color, naturally. Yeah, wild caught salmon jerky.
[41:08.190 --> 41:15.610]  The idea of like cod jerky is disgusting to me. Yeah, I'm just picturing the the gust coming out
[41:15.610 --> 41:21.610]  of the bag when you open it. I'm sure the mashed potatoes on the fish plate were delicious,
[41:21.930 --> 41:27.150]  but it does look like something that an alien from your smut novel would have admitted. Those
[41:27.150 --> 41:31.750]  aren't mashed potatoes. That is butter. That's butter and honey. That's just butter. Do you have
[41:31.750 --> 41:41.930]  bread and mash? Cornbread and fish. Well, wait, it's not a big pie. It's a small plate. It's not
[41:41.930 --> 41:47.010]  like a full meal of cornbread. It's like a little appetizer, so it may look like proportionally more
[41:47.010 --> 41:54.970]  butter than it is. So it's just cornbread. There's nothing on the inside? No, it's just cornbread,
[41:55.250 --> 42:01.470]  but it's shaped to look like a fish. I don't know what was confusing. No, I just decided
[42:01.470 --> 42:05.370]  that there was something in there already. I already trodged and horsed it immediately in my
[42:05.370 --> 42:10.030]  head as soon as I saw it. Standard cornbread. I was thinking that was like a croquette.
[42:10.250 --> 42:15.190]  It's easy for me to eat cornbread. I do not like fish very much. It's hard for me to eat fish,
[42:15.210 --> 42:19.410]  but here I am eating cornbread that looks like fish, thinking I bet I could trick myself into
[42:19.410 --> 42:23.530]  eating fish if I ate enough fish looking food. Would you try mashed potato on toast?
[42:24.230 --> 42:29.610]  That's a weird combo. Would I? That would be strange. Hell yeah. You got it on you right now?
[42:30.190 --> 42:33.530]  I bet that'd be pretty good. You just described two things I like a lot.
[42:34.270 --> 42:38.050]  Now we're talking like enough for it's like a sandwich, like a mashed potato sandwich.
[42:38.810 --> 42:42.670]  I was just thinking, like, just as you would spread butter, you would spread mash.
[42:44.690 --> 42:50.950]  Is mash spreadable? Of course it is. I mean, you thought butter was mash.
[42:51.990 --> 42:56.330]  Hey, once again, much like I should have put on hard. That was a great point by you.
[42:59.610 --> 43:05.070]  Very valid. I that would be what type of bread are we talking? I think that needs to be like
[43:05.070 --> 43:10.610]  Texas toast. Oh, thick, like a thick cut. I might make this for lunch.
[43:11.970 --> 43:18.530]  That sounds very British. Can you mash one potato? I guess you can. Yeah, of course you could. You
[43:18.530 --> 43:25.070]  can also just want to have a lot of mash. You want me to spread a baked potato? Why not?
[43:25.830 --> 43:28.730]  Or you can go to Rudy's and get their baked potato. It's so fucking good.
[43:30.010 --> 43:36.630]  Could you do a baked potato as the bread and mashed potato as the filling? You want me to
[43:36.630 --> 43:43.370]  spread potato on potato? Yeah, like a cut in half baked potato. What's wrong with me? You're
[43:43.370 --> 43:49.750]  spreading fucking baked potato or mashed potato on bread. It's all crazy. Makes more sense than
[43:49.750 --> 43:58.630]  spreading it on a potato. Is it too on the nose to put on like a potato bun? Oh, because I feel
[43:58.630 --> 44:03.210]  like that's the way I'd want to eat mashed potato. You know what I feel goes really good
[44:03.210 --> 44:07.410]  with mashed potatoes would be Parker House rolls. Maybe you could cut one of those in half and use
[44:07.410 --> 44:10.970]  it like a little mashed potato sandwich. What is that? I don't know. I don't think I know what
[44:10.970 --> 44:18.090]  that is. I'll send you a picture. You probably do. Well, there you go. Oh, little roll. Yeah.
[44:19.550 --> 44:25.370]  Hell yeah. This would be good. So OK, so you have bread. What type of bread are we doing?
[44:25.370 --> 44:31.490]  Let's break this down. We're talking like a white. We talk in a whole wheat. We talk in
[44:32.310 --> 44:38.510]  what is Texas toast? Usually white, white, white bread. Yeah, typically some white Texas toast.
[44:39.130 --> 44:43.750]  Then you're getting your jar of mashed potatoes scooping out of their
[44:43.750 --> 44:48.730]  jar. Well, because it's spreadable. I'm just trying to add to the thing.
[44:49.830 --> 44:54.390]  You know, Andrew, Andrew, I'm with you. Get those potatoes out of that jar.
[44:54.390 --> 44:58.790]  Let's get them out of the jar. Get them out of your body. Any favors in that jar? Get them out
[44:58.790 --> 45:03.850]  of there. You spread it down. Now, what are we looking at? We putting on some pepper. We're
[45:03.850 --> 45:10.230]  putting on some salt. I reckon a bit of pepper and maybe some like like onion crumble crap.
[45:10.390 --> 45:14.830]  That stuff, you know, I mean, crumble crap. No, I don't. What is this crumble crap?
[45:15.110 --> 45:21.490]  Like a crunchy, crunchy onion flakes. Crunchy onions. OK, yeah, I could support like like
[45:21.490 --> 45:29.650]  onion strings for cooking. What are they? Like little crisps. You're you're talking about like
[45:29.650 --> 45:34.770]  the French's crisp onion, like the little fried onion things that you would put on, Jeff, that
[45:34.770 --> 45:40.590]  you would put on like the green beans. That's what I thought. But he said, no, no, that's too big.
[45:41.530 --> 45:45.230]  OK, well, now now I don't know what he's talking about. Imagine that. But let's smash the pieces.
[45:45.230 --> 45:53.810]  OK, OK, OK. So smash those two pieces. Put that in a blender and sprinkle a few on, but not too much.
[45:54.130 --> 45:59.790]  So it looks like cornflakes, but they're onion. So the bottom of a basket of frings. OK, got it.
[46:01.990 --> 46:05.510]  What about like some cranberry sauce? Cranberry sauce mashed potato. Well, now we're now we're
[46:05.510 --> 46:08.570]  just I mean, this is now we're just having Thanksgiving dinner. Now it's just going to
[46:08.570 --> 46:13.010]  fall apart as you take it to your mouth. No. Well, is this double sided or just open?
[46:13.010 --> 46:18.710]  Is this an open faced sandwich? Double sided. You want mash on the underneath? No, I meant like
[46:18.710 --> 46:24.070]  bread for the bread situation, because that is determinant in how you build this. Do you
[46:24.070 --> 46:28.450]  have double sided toast? Well, if I'm making a turkey sandwich, it's double sided.
[46:31.270 --> 46:35.710]  See what I mean? An open sided sandwich. So I guess closed would be the opposite of what I'm
[46:35.710 --> 46:41.710]  saying. Is this closed? How is one thing open or closed? If you have a sandwich that is just
[46:41.710 --> 46:45.310]  one singular slice with stuff on top of it, it's open faced.
[46:45.670 --> 46:48.870]  Yeah. So you're asking if there's two slices or one? Yes.
[46:50.790 --> 46:56.290]  Jesus. Are you going to? Yeah, I'm with you, Gavin. He's yeah, he's nuts, dude. That's crazy.
[46:57.170 --> 47:01.730]  I don't know who's on whose side. But what's the what's the answer to his question? Imagine
[47:01.730 --> 47:06.730]  peanut butter on toast, right? Yeah. Yeah. Except it's mash and there's pepper and little onion
[47:06.730 --> 47:14.310]  crisps. So it's an open. So is it two pieces of toast? No, there's no one else is confused here.
[47:14.590 --> 47:20.450]  Like you're like you're like in attack mode out of confusion, but no one else is confused.
[47:20.790 --> 47:25.790]  OK, I'm back into the corner and I'm all puffed up, but no, it's open faced toast. It's good.
[47:26.350 --> 47:31.190]  Open faced toast. What's closed? Closed toast is just a sandwich, isn't it? Yeah.
[47:32.370 --> 47:35.490]  Yeah. Well, that's why we keep saying open faced sandwich, right? I think that's why people are
[47:35.490 --> 47:42.630]  saying that. I am just trying to break Gavin's brain and I don't think I've ever been more
[47:42.630 --> 47:47.590]  successful at just trying to break his brain. It's really working. I don't know. These subtle
[47:47.590 --> 47:53.150]  differences between Canada and England that you just don't know about. Yeah, double sided,
[47:53.710 --> 47:58.990]  some double sided toast. So you've got a you got a piece of Texas toast, then you got some mashed
[47:58.990 --> 48:06.470]  potatoes on top of that. And then you've got some some onion bits, right? Crispy onion bits.
[48:06.610 --> 48:11.930]  And then what's next? For me, that's it. No salt, no pepper. No, a bit pepper as well.
[48:12.450 --> 48:16.090]  OK, what about butter? You want to put a little pat of butter on it or a little burn gravy?
[48:16.430 --> 48:22.290]  I don't like the combination of onion and butter. I mean, onions love butter. I don't know why.
[48:22.870 --> 48:25.790]  But it's because it's crispy. Like then it gets soggy.
[48:26.390 --> 48:28.830]  Well, it's going to get pretty soggy in the mash.
[48:30.130 --> 48:34.830]  It's going on something soft and soggy. I mean, we could all try making this and see how we feel
[48:34.830 --> 48:40.090]  about it. Yeah, I like that. Let's do it. We could do that. What are we going to call this?
[48:40.610 --> 48:44.190]  Maybe we each come up with our own names for how we do it. Mashed potato toast.
[48:45.010 --> 48:49.510]  Oh, I like mashed potato toast. That's right. Yeah, I think I want to declare that one the
[48:49.510 --> 48:52.950]  winner before we even go any further. That was pretty way to go, dude. Wow.
[48:54.330 --> 48:59.530]  Holy shit. That is a great name. It is officially, as of this moment, mashed potato toast,
[48:59.590 --> 49:04.310]  and it is going to be the first recipe in our new cookbook that now has to happen. Goddamn.
[49:04.590 --> 49:10.950]  Mashed potato toast. Season two. Mashed potato toast. Oh, I'm excited to go into the lab with
[49:10.950 --> 49:16.310]  this. I am too. I feel like it's been a while since we've hit the lab. It has been. It's
[49:16.310 --> 49:22.770]  been too long. I have a little clip. Can I play it? Please. It's from best summer
[49:22.770 --> 49:28.970]  things draft. Oh, no. Of the road trip. Well, it's the thing. The thing about it is is they
[49:28.970 --> 49:34.530]  use it as a trope in horror movies because it is the pinnacle of fun. I know. I know. I said
[49:34.530 --> 49:39.810]  I knew it when I said it. I said when I correct myself in the middle of the fucking episode.
[49:40.010 --> 49:44.750]  I thought Pent Ultimate was the only one. I think you've got an issue with pens.
[49:45.130 --> 49:49.770]  I just I meant to say I meant to say pinnacle. I just said pinnacle. I was thinking I don't know
[49:49.770 --> 49:55.630]  why I got pentagram and pinnacle jumbled up in my head. It's just a sign of age. Every time I
[49:55.630 --> 49:59.470]  it's just it's good. I'll be honest with you. It's going to happen with increasing frequency
[49:59.470 --> 50:07.590]  as I get closer to death. Oh, my God. Mashed potato. That's not as funny.
[50:12.110 --> 50:17.810]  I I Gavin loves flubs more than I think anyone loves anything. I really do. I don't know why
[50:17.810 --> 50:22.670]  they've really, really made me laugh. When that happened, did you write down like roughly where
[50:22.670 --> 50:27.010]  it was in the recording to go back to it? Or was it when you were reviewing it, you heard it?
[50:27.830 --> 50:31.330]  I think while I was reviewing it and then I just take a screenshot of the time code.
[50:31.590 --> 50:34.210]  God, you could have asked me. I could have told you exactly when and where it happened. I've been
[50:34.210 --> 50:40.390]  thinking about it for a fucking two weeks. Wait, waiting for it to waiting for it to hit Reddit.
[50:41.910 --> 50:45.510]  Did anyone notice, Geoff, until this moment? No, I don't think so.
[50:46.190 --> 50:51.910]  I knew about it. I've been I've seriously been bugging me. Really? Uh-huh. Yeah. From the second
[50:51.910 --> 50:56.370]  it left my mouth. Oh, no. We were just too far down the road to go back. That was your
[50:56.370 --> 51:01.550]  Paul Scheer in Twisters. That was internally. It's just been eating you alive. Yeah, exactly. We have
[51:01.550 --> 51:06.590]  no idea. Yeah, you've got the Paul Scheer thing. I was embarrassed by the point most. I think we're
[51:06.590 --> 51:11.890]  all just embarrassing ourselves. That's what this is our embarrassment era. Yeah. I'd argue this
[51:11.890 --> 51:15.190]  whole thing is our embarrassment era. I don't think we've ever left the embarrassment era.
[51:15.510 --> 51:23.070]  It's sort of the point. I was recently in England and, uh, you know, traveling and doing a lot of
[51:23.070 --> 51:31.050]  shit. I've I've I feel like a lot of people changed some behavior after Covid a little
[51:31.050 --> 51:36.650]  bit more considerate about, you know, bodily fluids and sprays. Totally. But there's just
[51:36.650 --> 51:41.890]  an absolute spree in the airport in Heathrow of people just coughing right into their hands.
[51:42.690 --> 51:47.350]  Aren't you not supposed to cough on your hands? Where do you cough if you have a big if you have
[51:47.350 --> 51:52.390]  a big throat clear in a spur? You cough into the shoulder. My fourth grade teacher taught me that.
[51:52.670 --> 51:56.210]  I cough into my elbow, I think. Yeah, inner elbow. Shoulder. How do you cough?
[51:57.530 --> 52:03.850]  That's a real stretch. No, I just turn my head. I kind of you know, it's sort of it's down that
[52:03.850 --> 52:09.930]  line because I do bring the arm up, too. It's like the least impressive dab, which is saying a lot.
[52:09.930 --> 52:14.450]  I don't think there is an impressive one, but it is like half dab for sneezing.
[52:16.390 --> 52:22.010]  I would say. I just think that everyone is more disgusting than ever, like putting my stuff
[52:22.010 --> 52:26.830]  through the X-ray thing and security and just the person in front of me coughing all over and then
[52:26.830 --> 52:33.290]  touching my tray to like get to get to there. I'm just like, wow. Do you ever like cough or sneeze
[52:33.290 --> 52:38.350]  in your own space and are just a fucking animal about it? Oh, I love doing that. If I'm just alone
[52:38.350 --> 52:44.070]  in my office, I'll deliberately sneeze on stuff like the door or just like on the wall. That's not
[52:44.070 --> 52:49.470]  what I meant. You're aiming. Will you like walk over to something and be like, oh, this is really
[52:49.470 --> 52:53.670]  going to be bad. If I'm walking through, if I'm just walking out of my office, I'll just get it
[52:53.670 --> 53:00.450]  really, really close to the door and just sneeze right on it. Oh, I I've spent so much time traveling
[53:00.450 --> 53:04.670]  over the last couple of weeks that I just hate all of humanity right now. I don't ever want to
[53:04.670 --> 53:10.170]  travel ever again. I'm so fucking bummed that I got to get on a plane. It just sucks. People suck.
[53:10.470 --> 53:17.330]  People in public suck. Everything sucks. Ugh. You know what doesn't suck? Hot dogs around the world
[53:17.330 --> 53:20.550]  don't suck. I had some good ass hot dogs last couple of weeks. Oh, you had some good hot dogs?
[53:20.870 --> 53:26.250]  Consistent? Yeah, man. The Midwest knows their hot dogs. Should we do a hot dog? Uh, should we like
[53:26.250 --> 53:30.870]  we haven't really updated the audience on our hot dog counter or anything. Let's let's update them.
[53:30.870 --> 53:38.070]  Let's get into the dog count part of our Slack channel and have a look at where we're at. Currently,
[53:38.990 --> 53:49.450]  Andrew has six. Nick has three. Hang on. I'm scrolling back. I have five. Gavin has zero.
[53:50.050 --> 53:59.550]  And Jeff has twelve. Jeff's been on a run. Jeff, Jeff, it's not a race. This is not a competition.
[53:59.930 --> 54:02.110]  Does that mean I've had more than the rest of you put together?
[54:03.410 --> 54:09.470]  Uh, no, not quite, because Andrew's up there, I'm up there, and Nick has a few. So I think we're
[54:09.470 --> 54:15.630]  right around the same amount. Gavin was zero. Yeah, Gavin was zero. But that makes sense. I
[54:15.630 --> 54:21.030]  only started eating these dogs. We did this count and I went, why am I trying to eat hot dogs?
[54:21.350 --> 54:25.010]  Because it was meant to be that we're just seeing how many dogs we eat, but all it's done is turn
[54:25.010 --> 54:32.250]  into a massive dog competition. I realized, and I don't want to compete. Who do you think is
[54:32.250 --> 54:39.110]  competing though? You! I'm absolutely not competing. I'm only eating dogs when it's appropriate and
[54:39.110 --> 54:44.090]  when I find myself in a place to eat dogs. I just happened to have been at a bunch of baseball games
[54:44.090 --> 54:48.670]  and in a fucking city that prides itself on hot dogs. You can't walk three feet in
[54:48.670 --> 54:52.750]  Chicago without seeing a hot dog. So it's like when in Rome, you know, like I went to,
[54:52.750 --> 54:56.630]  my wife likes that restaurant Portillo's. So we went to Portillo's twice. What else am I going to
[54:56.630 --> 55:01.510]  eat at Portillo's other than a hot dog? I'll have a Chicago beef. I had one of those. We're not
[55:01.510 --> 55:06.110]  counting those though. So I'm just, I could go another month without eating a hot dog. I just
[55:06.110 --> 55:11.750]  have been in hot dog heavy situations. You've been in very hot dog heavy situations. It's a lot, man.
[55:12.810 --> 55:16.950]  You've inspired me. You've been posting images of your dogs. I've gone, you know what? That looks
[55:16.950 --> 55:20.790]  delicious. They do look good. That's another thing. They're good looking hot dogs out there.
[55:20.790 --> 55:24.770]  How do you say no? Yeah, you've had some corkers on there. Some of those look delicious.
[55:25.670 --> 55:30.410]  Dude, I went, I went to this place in Chicago called Devil Dogs in Wicker Park. Oh my God,
[55:30.450 --> 55:35.630]  this fucking snap to the casing that like no other hot dog I've ever eaten has. They pride
[55:35.630 --> 55:38.610]  themselves on it. It's so fucking good. That's what I said to that picture of that little,
[55:38.990 --> 55:43.390]  did I send you guys a picture of that little, little hot dog man? It was so cute. Yes, you did.
[55:43.550 --> 55:47.230]  Oh, okay. Yeah. There you go. He's coating himself in condiment. Yeah.
[55:49.970 --> 55:55.090]  Yeah. That's yeah. I swear I'm not trying to compete with you guys or anything. It's just,
[55:55.510 --> 55:59.830]  you know, I can tell you're just living that life, Jeff. Yeah. Enjoying that hot dog glow.
[56:00.290 --> 56:04.270]  I mean, that's part of how this whole thing started, right? Was I asked you guys,
[56:04.350 --> 56:09.170]  what's the food you can't say no to? For me, it's hot dogs. I'll never say no to a hot dog.
[56:09.650 --> 56:15.190]  You know, speaking of previous recordings, I have a little update on something that I felt like
[56:15.190 --> 56:23.610]  would clarify previous situations. We went through recently my my computer setup and my folders and
[56:23.610 --> 56:31.590]  my desktop and all that. And I was trying to articulate why I had a desktop folder to find
[56:31.590 --> 56:37.950]  the stuff on my desktop and probably can't use this image publicly because I don't know what
[56:37.950 --> 56:44.570]  exactly is here. This is what my desktop used to look like, which is why I required the information
[56:45.990 --> 56:52.930]  from the list, because I couldn't find anything. So I needed to be able to get a thumbnail.
[56:53.310 --> 56:58.270]  Jeff, can you? Well, he said he said it can't because he doesn't know what's on there. It's
[56:58.270 --> 57:02.810]  just all my files. So I don't there's probably like banking information and stuff on that.
[57:03.210 --> 57:09.050]  The best way I could describe it would be if he played a game of free sell with every file on
[57:09.050 --> 57:13.970]  his computer and won. And it's that scene when you win free sell and all the cards go in every
[57:13.970 --> 57:17.910]  direction. But it's every one of his files. It's like the solitaire bouncing cards.
[57:18.130 --> 57:22.770]  So that is not how it's all cleaned up now. So it's not really necessary. But that is why it was
[57:22.770 --> 57:28.890]  such an issue when I lost my desktop little clicky thing. You know, that's insane, though, right?
[57:28.970 --> 57:34.550]  You must have been 20 percent towards this end result when you were like, this is insane. I'm
[57:34.550 --> 57:37.590]  just going to keep it this way because it's insane. Or did you look at that and think,
[57:37.650 --> 57:42.470]  how did that happen? I would just never look at it and immediately open Google and then that would
[57:42.470 --> 57:46.890]  be gone and I wouldn't see it. And I'd be like, I don't even know it's back. You know, I will say
[57:46.890 --> 57:51.230]  I don't see my desktop very often, either. If I think about it, I usually have windows open in
[57:51.230 --> 57:56.730]  front of it. There's nothing. And my way to access all of that information was through the little
[57:56.730 --> 58:03.490]  clicky two face tab to face one smile to find. Yeah. Yeah. To be fair, I do think it's insane
[58:03.490 --> 58:09.230]  that screenshots go to the desktop and not like a pictures or a screenshot folder somewhere.
[58:09.230 --> 58:13.990]  Yeah, it's ridiculous. Outrageous. That is I wanted to provide some context as to
[58:14.530 --> 58:18.170]  the importance of that. You should remove that image so I don't accidentally post it
[58:18.170 --> 58:21.690]  because I'll forget. So is it it's cleaned up now? It doesn't look like this.
[58:21.990 --> 58:25.970]  No, it's all clean now. I can see. Now, when you say that, what does that mean?
[58:26.650 --> 58:31.270]  You want me to see what it looks like currently? Let me. Oh, my God. I got so many windows. I got
[58:31.270 --> 58:35.070]  fucking out of here. It's frozen.
[58:37.530 --> 58:44.190]  Oh, shit. Get out of here. Apple ID. Yeah, I can't believe I asked for. I can't believe he gave an
[58:44.190 --> 58:47.470]  update and then I asked for a. No, no. One second. One second. One second. One second. I'm getting
[58:47.470 --> 58:51.170]  there. I'm getting there. I'm getting there. Adobe Acrobat updater has not been able to.
[58:51.290 --> 58:55.290]  I don't care. You don't have like a button to show the desktop or a corner or like click on the
[58:55.290 --> 59:01.170]  desktop. It's a computer that I'm using that's not for recording is the desktop in question.
[59:02.150 --> 59:06.550]  What does that pinwheeling? Well, how would I share the screen to a computer that is not
[59:06.550 --> 59:10.850]  connected to this discord? I didn't ask you to share the screen. What did you ask? Sorry.
[59:13.190 --> 59:18.830]  Run the question back. I was trying to get to my desktop. I didn't hear what was the question.
[59:21.790 --> 59:26.570]  I just want to see it. I double sided. You don't have to share it. I just take a picture.
[59:27.530 --> 59:30.130]  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to literally get there so I can take a photo.
[59:31.430 --> 59:37.930]  Get to your desktop. I know time's run out. I don't want to activate her by now.
[59:40.510 --> 59:43.370]  Still trying. I didn't think it was going to. Gavin, I didn't think it was going to turn into
[59:43.370 --> 59:48.350]  this. I apologize. You know, like in movies when a company is getting like audited or shut down
[59:48.350 --> 59:52.450]  and everyone just start shredding everything and there's papers flying it. Yeah, that's what he's
[59:52.450 --> 59:59.210]  doing to get to his desktop. I'm almost there. Oh, almost. Fucking hide. I'm clicking the hide
[59:59.210 --> 01:00:04.330]  button. Hey, while he's doing that, Gavin, did he ever 3D scan his head and give it to you so
[01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:08.430]  you can put it on share? OK, I'll do that. Goddamn. Didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't I
[01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:12.450]  send him your phone for that? Yeah, he sent the soy phone so he could do it. Yeah. OK,
[01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:19.050]  I'll do I'll do that today. That is it will happen now. Well, not now, but people not
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.130]  understanding what we were talking about with the soy phone and read it and having
[01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:27.310]  getting real confused by it. What was it? It said soy. This phone contains soy oil.
[01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:31.830]  Yeah, like there's a sticker on the back of the box. Yeah, I wonder if it's like a part of the
[01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:38.150]  pigment of the paint or something. What are you doing? What are you doing? I just realized that
[01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:47.030]  the people that the people that missed our very first stream missed the whole piss rat thing.
[01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:53.050]  Like we're always doing piss rats in the chat. And it's just because Eric left for like two
[01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:57.850]  minutes or something right as we started. But I realized that you can't even go back and see
[01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:03.870]  that because Nick trimmed off the piss rats part. Yep. So maybe we should post maybe we should find
[01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:08.430]  that file and post the piss rat origin. OK, I don't think so. Origin of the origin of piss rat.
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:12.110]  Yeah, because we already got we already got the origin of Spummer out there. And I think that's
[01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:17.330]  more than enough. I'm more of a guy at this point. I'm a big time Spummer guy. I got no
[01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:22.310]  idea what Spummer is. I can't wait to find out all about that. Oh, so you've got. OK,
[01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:29.550]  so Adobe. It's not that clean. There's still like 50 things. That's that's what I was that
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:32.450]  that's really what I was driving at is like, I know what this is going to look like and it's
[01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:38.230]  not going to be what it is. What what do you do with Adobe Acrobat updater? I don't know
[01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:42.270]  what. There's two options popping up in my face and is being annoying.
[01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.430]  Two options. You can enter a password and hit install helper or you hit cancel.
[01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:49.510]  I've tried both and they don't do anything.
[01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:56.250]  I both. So maybe it's another supplemental. I have a problem where it says, hey, you need to
[01:01:56.250 --> 01:02:02.830]  log into this thing and then I do it and then Apple says, OK, now that's not right, but it is
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:08.630]  right. So I don't know what to do. It just doesn't do. It sounds like it's just not right. No, it's
[01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:14.650]  OK. So it says. It's fine, you know, we don't need to do this again. I feel like I'm back
[01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:18.870]  at a tech support company, but it says I need to update my settings, I click continue, I put the
[01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:24.270]  password in and then just nothing happens. It says do it. It says some account services will not
[01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.490]  be available until you sign in again. I say, OK, continue. And then it just takes me back to that
[01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:36.510]  screen because I'm signed in. Just uninstall it. Yeah. Oh, wait. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. What'd you do?
[01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:40.650]  Enter password. Yeah, well, that's apparently wrong. I don't know my password, I guess.
[01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:45.430]  You don't have the password to your iMac? Right. That's what I'm saying, is that you just enter
[01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:50.390]  the password and this will be done. And he doesn't know. And I know he doesn't know. There's no way.
[01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.030]  How do you not know the password to your own computer? What do you do?
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:59.670]  Wait, how do you log into it? Let me try this. He hasn't rebooted this computer in seven years.
[01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.990]  We are. We keep asking. How do you reboot a computer? What do you mean? What do you mean?
[01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:09.670]  It always just logs in when I reboot it like I've done the reboot. So you have no password on your
[01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:15.030]  Mac? Well, I clearly do, because there's a like a lock. If you don't have a password,
[01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:21.310]  then just hit install helper with no password. Okay, I entered the right password and then it
[01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:27.550]  goes away and nothing happens. Sounds like you did it. Nothing's changed. It drives me crazy.
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.250]  Every day it pops up with this thing. You need to do this. And I do it and then nothing happens.
[01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:38.870]  Nothing. I've tried one thing and it sort of solves it and I figure I'll just live with it forever.
[01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:42.450]  I'm all out of ideas. So if I do a restart, is that a reboot?
[01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:51.410]  Jeff, are you OK? How do I reboot this thing? Jeff, use your tech support skills.
[01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:55.530]  Sir, I'm going to need you to go ahead and click on the black apple icon on the top left
[01:03:55.530 --> 01:04:01.490]  of the screen. If you could go to that and then click on the restart button. One left click.
[01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:08.350]  OK, that's how we that's how we reboot a computer here in 2024. I was just confirming.
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:11.770]  Yeah, no, I'm just I'm just here to help you, sir. Just just here to help.
[01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:16.630]  And to be clear, you're saying when it comes back on, it just logs in on its own.
[01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:22.150]  Almost certainly. Yes. Here we go. And we're waiting for it. I click the button. Nothing's
[01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:28.350]  happening. What button did you are you referring to? Oh, it's not cycling through Finder and
[01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:35.790]  all Spotify. And I think it's closing any open. OK, here we go. Now it is iconless.
[01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:43.870]  OK, it's a generic background of Ireland. I'm assuming he is. He just is he walking
[01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:48.730]  us through what it looks like when you reboot a computer? I think so. OK, now it turned off.
[01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:56.070]  Now it's back on. Right. That's like a surprise. He said it like he's never seen it do that.
[01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:58.570]  Well, what was weird about that is, as you know about this,
[01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:04.530]  doesn't it typically do the apple and all that when you when it comes on? Yeah,
[01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:08.670]  they didn't do that. Just went black and then went back to Ireland. Oh, now we're black again.
[01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:16.150]  It's still it's still turning off. Why did you a little peekaboo? Oh, there's the apple.
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:22.570]  I'm going to guess it's because it doesn't remember how to reboot because it hasn't done
[01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:28.990]  it in so long. Have you rebooted it since you tried to print the law? Oh yeah. Plenty of times.
[01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:35.650]  OK, this thing breaks all the time. Oh, yeah. All the time. It's old. We've been over this.
[01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:39.730]  It's like 13 years old. Do you think it's time for a new one? And maybe
[01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:44.990]  the law would print immediately on the new one? I don't know if any computer can handle the Canadian
[01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:50.630]  law. I don't know if it matters. I don't know how you're hanging on. I have mine
[01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:54.850]  is from like twenty eighteen and it's killing me. I got to get a new one so bad.
[01:05:55.410 --> 01:06:00.910]  It makes me a patient man. I just stare at the pinwheel, ponder, think about life. I think about
[01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:08.630]  open sided toast, closed toast, double sided toast. Maybe if we end this episode and start
[01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:14.410]  the next one, it will be rebooted by then. Oh, wow. What a cliffhanger. Oh, I love it.
[01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:21.290]  Celestial Glorbosis is cliffhanger. You mean cliffbanger? Cliffbanger. It's a twofer. Yeah.
[01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:27.110]  Speaking of twofer, that's what we're doing today. So we have to end this episode of the
[01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:32.050]  Regulation Podcast so that we can turn around and start the next episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:39.870]  Thanks for tuning in and listening to Andrew discover how computers work. We'll see you next
[01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:47.730]  time. Hopefully you'll go to our what is it? Patreon.com slash the Regulation Pod and poke
[01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:52.470]  around. That's it. See what's up there. There you go. See you next time. Bye. Might as well have
[01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:57.730]  a look around like Avelina said. Bye bye. Should we put a link to Celestial Glorbosis in the
[01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:03.270]  description? Yes. I think I think we can. Yeah. All right. It seems to be better in a bag. Bye.
[01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:19.430]  Gasta menos, sonríe más.
