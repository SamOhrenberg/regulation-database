[00:30.320 --> 00:33.820]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:34.160 --> 00:36.560]  This is episode 32. Nick's already laughing.
[00:36.700 --> 00:39.260]  That means it's going to be a really good one for some reason.
[00:39.600 --> 00:45.240]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, the aforementioned Nick, and Eric Baddour.
[00:45.560 --> 00:46.380]  I have an announcement.
[00:46.800 --> 00:48.200]  Oh my God!
[00:48.320 --> 00:49.300]  You got your dick back?
[00:50.580 --> 00:51.840]  No, I'm still waiting on that.
[00:52.360 --> 00:54.600]  My announcement is I think I'm done with bagels.
[00:56.520 --> 00:59.760]  They're always... they're like a 6 out of 10, maybe a 7.
[00:59.900 --> 01:02.540]  And I don't think I've ever had above a 7 out of 10.
[01:02.740 --> 01:05.180]  And I should just stop expecting that from bagels.
[01:05.480 --> 01:06.920]  7 out of 10 is high.
[01:07.180 --> 01:08.360]  You don't think that's very high.
[01:08.540 --> 01:14.860]  You don't think that... you don't think it has anything to do with, like, your location playing into that at all?
[01:15.000 --> 01:15.820]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:16.480 --> 01:17.640]  Or being in Texas.
[01:18.300 --> 01:19.980]  Yeah, they suck here.
[01:20.080 --> 01:20.600]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:21.180 --> 01:22.980]  It is a regional thing, Gavin.
[01:22.980 --> 01:25.900]  He said 7 out of 10 is high?
[01:26.560 --> 01:26.880]  Yeah.
[01:27.380 --> 01:33.380]  Tell that to every teacher and my parents every time I got a 75 on a fucking test.
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.660]  No, honestly, Jeff, if you were getting 75 on tests, I'd be pretty proud of you.
[01:37.100 --> 01:43.260]  The thing about it is that 7 out of 10 for a food is really high to say I'm done with this thing forever.
[01:43.800 --> 01:49.160]  But I feel like eventually I should be stumbling across 8s and 9s and I'm just stuck at the ceiling of 7.
[01:49.360 --> 01:54.680]  I think he's saying, yeah, if a food has a ceiling of a 7, what's the fucking point?
[01:55.060 --> 01:57.980]  A 7 is a really high ceiling for a food.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.580]  What? How much food are you eating under 7, Andrew?
[02:01.720 --> 02:03.560]  Let me just throw this out here.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.960]  He's getting a 7 out of 10 and all he has to do is fucking put it in a toaster and spread something on it.
[02:09.180 --> 02:13.600]  The amount of effort to 7 is so minimal. It's an insane thing to cut.
[02:13.600 --> 02:19.020]  No, you're a fool because sometimes I can put in bread and just slop a bit of peanut butter on it, peanut butter on toast.
[02:19.120 --> 02:20.560]  I could easily get 8 out of 10 on that.
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.360]  Okay, well then just do that. I think that's what he's saying he's doing.
[02:25.820 --> 02:30.100]  Do you ever get nervous, Charlies? Like, where are you getting your bagels, I guess, is my question.
[02:31.500 --> 02:32.980]  Uh, all over.
[02:34.160 --> 02:35.500]  Okay, name one.
[02:36.040 --> 02:38.900]  Yeah, see, this is what happens. You start poking holes.
[02:38.900 --> 02:44.400]  Are you going grocery store bagels? Are you going to like a bakery? What type of establishment?
[02:44.780 --> 02:50.540]  I'll hit up HEB. I'll hit up some places that do bagels.
[02:50.700 --> 02:56.380]  Alright, Gav, here's the deal. There are three what I would consider to be decent bagel shops in Austin.
[02:56.660 --> 03:02.260]  I will agree with you that bagels in Austin, after living on the East Coast, are largely shitty.
[03:03.140 --> 03:08.440]  Bagels in New Jersey, it's like the breakfast taco of New Jersey. It's a whole other world up there what they do with a bagel. It's amazing.
[03:08.440 --> 03:11.900]  You could find an eight and a half easily over there.
[03:12.580 --> 03:16.100]  But in Austin, we have three places that I think are considered the good spots.
[03:16.340 --> 03:22.520]  Biedermann's Deli, which is where I would always get my pastrami back in the day. That's a hot bagel house right there. A lot of bagels.
[03:22.860 --> 03:29.740]  Then you've got Rockstar Bagels over on the East Side, which I personally think is incredibly overrated and you should completely avoid.
[03:30.260 --> 03:33.000]  And then that place Eric mentioned, Nervous Charlie's on Lamar.
[03:33.460 --> 03:35.620]  Nervous Charlie's is where I'm getting my sevens from.
[03:36.000 --> 03:36.060]  Yeah.
[03:36.140 --> 03:37.400]  I mean, they're definitely the best I'm getting.
[03:37.400 --> 03:40.540]  I would say Nervous Charlie's is like a 7 out of 10 bagel spot.
[03:41.100 --> 03:42.800]  What type of bagels are you getting?
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.400]  The last bagel I got was... it was a plain bagel.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.740]  You fucking... ridiculous.
[03:50.440 --> 03:52.100]  Well, let me finish. Let me finish.
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.260]  Plain bagel, low-fat cream cheese, avocado, tomato.
[03:58.440 --> 04:04.760]  Well, the toppings aren't the thing. You're retiring the bagel for toast when you're just having a plain bagel.
[04:05.220 --> 04:08.640]  The whole joy of the bagel is the variety of the types of bagel you can get.
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.020]  There's no everything toast.
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.300]  There's nothing worse than an everything bagel. That's a piece of shit.
[04:14.300 --> 04:14.680]  Oh, insane.
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.700]  I don't want all that shite.
[04:16.420 --> 04:17.520]  Insane bagel takes.
[04:17.900 --> 04:21.200]  Yeah, I'm on Andrew's side on that one. Everything bagel is pretty awesome.
[04:21.500 --> 04:23.980]  But I gotta swing back to Gavin and defend.
[04:24.140 --> 04:28.100]  A plain bagel should... you should be able to get an 8 or a 9 on a plain bagel.
[04:28.360 --> 04:30.020]  Oh, I agree. And I do regularly.
[04:30.560 --> 04:34.320]  OK, well, what do you go for? What's your bagel build? What's your loadout?
[04:34.320 --> 04:38.180]  I'm going to be honest. I haven't had a bagel since my husband's bagels went away.
[04:38.520 --> 04:39.560]  And the regulation bagels went away.
[04:39.560 --> 04:39.980]  Oh no!
[04:40.460 --> 04:42.320]  I just haven't. I haven't been able to find that love again.
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.360]  But they're great. They're a great food.
[04:45.120 --> 04:45.940]  But what do you go for?
[04:48.960 --> 04:49.880]  Do you not remember?
[04:50.540 --> 04:50.960]  What do you mean?
[04:51.780 --> 04:52.920]  What do you mean what I mean?
[04:53.320 --> 04:57.500]  What was the regulation bagel? Was the regulation bagel your regulation bagel?
[04:58.620 --> 05:01.880]  What was it? It was two types of cream cheese. It was a bacon...
[05:02.360 --> 05:05.560]  Listen, this was a long time ago, and I've had to try to repress these memories.
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.200]  You're out here defending bagels as the best thing since, apparently, sliced bread, and you don't remember anything about them?
[05:11.560 --> 05:14.560]  No, I just am trying to remember the specifics of what the...
[05:14.560 --> 05:21.240]  It was a garlic, pepper, cream cheese, and then like a bacon scallion cream cheese mix.
[05:21.620 --> 05:24.600]  It was those two mixed on a cheddar bagel.
[05:24.880 --> 05:27.180]  I think for me, it's the toughness.
[05:27.580 --> 05:30.600]  Like, you can't just bite through a bagel. You have to always give it a bit of tear.
[05:30.600 --> 05:34.100]  You need it to be a little bit draggy of the teeth.
[05:34.920 --> 05:34.940]  Interesting.
[05:34.980 --> 05:36.780]  Maybe that's what drags the whole experience down.
[05:36.920 --> 05:39.760]  I understand. I get that. I definitely get that.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.160]  And I sort of understand what you're saying on a whole about being done with something, whatever.
[05:46.560 --> 05:55.840]  It's just that when you're like, yeah, I'm like getting like seven out of ten pretty consistently, and to like throw it out is really strange to me.
[05:55.840 --> 06:04.080]  Like seven out of ten, seven out of ten is a pretty good score to be like, and I'm fucking done with it forever.
[06:04.400 --> 06:08.420]  I'm more just throwing out my expectations as opposed to throwing out the entire bagel.
[06:08.520 --> 06:10.140]  I think I've done with them for a while, definitely.
[06:10.360 --> 06:15.400]  But I just, I'm always at the end of the bagel just like, yeah, all right.
[06:16.140 --> 06:18.080]  Whereas other things have a greater range.
[06:19.180 --> 06:22.340]  Like a BLT. A BLT could be a five or it could be a ten.
[06:23.120 --> 06:25.080]  What kind of BLT is a five?
[06:25.080 --> 06:28.120]  I feel like a BLT, a bad BLT is like a nine.
[06:28.660 --> 06:36.040]  Mainly like from Thundercloud when they forget to put the B in or they're too high and they make the wrong thing.
[06:36.100 --> 06:38.380]  Gotcha. Well, it's just like loaded with salt.
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.220]  If you're shopping at Thundercloud, the prerequisite to work there is that you're too high.
[06:44.380 --> 06:48.260]  So you got to know going in that you're probably going to get somebody else's sandwich.
[06:48.520 --> 06:52.240]  Like I understand that they're all high, but sometimes they can barely comprehend.
[06:53.180 --> 06:54.160]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[06:55.160 --> 06:57.380]  It's kind of like a part of its charm though.
[06:57.980 --> 07:01.040]  I had a BLT once and I got lettuce and mustard.
[07:02.000 --> 07:02.840]  Oh, that's great.
[07:04.020 --> 07:06.560]  Whoa, that's an LM? That's crazy.
[07:06.680 --> 07:07.040]  An LM.
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.720]  Wait, you got a BLM?
[07:12.660 --> 07:13.980]  A bacon, lettuce, mustard?
[07:14.600 --> 07:19.660]  Do you ever mix it up with your, you're like playing with like low-fat cream cheese, whatever.
[07:19.940 --> 07:23.800]  Do you ever mix up the kind of bagel or the kind of cream cheese you get just to see if like...
[07:24.260 --> 07:26.220]  there's something else there for you?
[07:26.920 --> 07:32.500]  I just need to, I feel like I only ever get, I've only ever had like a plain and then I ventured out into everything.
[07:32.620 --> 07:34.900]  And that was just too much for me. And I've not really got in between.
[07:35.940 --> 07:39.340]  So you're at zero or 100 and that's it?
[07:39.560 --> 07:44.940]  Well, I thought that would help me hone in, but it turns out when you just start with everything, I don't know which parts of it I don't like.
[07:45.060 --> 07:48.100]  I mean, a garlic bagel's good. I like a salt bagel.
[07:49.160 --> 07:54.540]  Like when you do, I think at Nervous Charlie's, I like their sun-dried tomato one and their jalapeno cheddar one.
[07:54.540 --> 07:55.140]  Oh, you're an animal.
[07:55.140 --> 07:55.800]  I think those are really good.
[07:56.300 --> 07:58.920]  Jalapeno cheddar bagel is the best bagel, I think.
[07:58.960 --> 08:00.920]  I think it's, I think it's really good, but...
[08:00.920 --> 08:05.460]  Can you name a format where a sun-dried tomato is better than a regular wet one?
[08:05.900 --> 08:09.940]  Uh, yeah. On a, on a bagel on the top of it where it's baked in.
[08:13.400 --> 08:15.980]  That was... any, any other questions?
[08:15.980 --> 08:18.400]  Uh, good answer.
[08:18.660 --> 08:31.220]  Yeah, okay, cool. Uh, I just, I think that you have, I think if 7 out of 10 is the thing that you're throwing out for, I just think you need to do more research on what you like in a bagel.
[08:31.300 --> 08:35.260]  But I understand the thing that you're saying that you don't like, I completely understand.
[08:35.420 --> 08:41.340]  The amount of chew and tear that you need to like bite hard and rip through for like a sandwich, I agree with that.
[08:41.720 --> 08:44.020]  I feel like British food is all about chew and tear.
[08:45.240 --> 08:45.840]  Go on.
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.160]  I just, when I think of British food in my head, it's very chewy, it's very tear.
[08:51.280 --> 08:52.040]  Which food?
[08:52.560 --> 08:54.000]  All of it, just in my head, all of it.
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.640]  What are you talking about? You're all with the opinions today. You, you've got no sources and all opinions today.
[08:59.900 --> 09:04.980]  What do you mean? You coming in trying to retire bagels for being a 7 out of 10?
[09:05.340 --> 09:10.720]  What's your, what's your bagel loadout? Don't remember. Uh, what food is chewy? All of it.
[09:12.360 --> 09:18.140]  Well, the stuff we ate with the cookies, those cookies, there's some fucking hard chew cookies.
[09:18.620 --> 09:20.020]  When we did the advent stuff.
[09:20.660 --> 09:22.640]  Well, they're probably old as shit, right?
[09:22.780 --> 09:23.720]  No, they weren't.
[09:24.740 --> 09:26.020]  Only the chips were expired.
[09:28.100 --> 09:29.940]  I know your pain on that one, buddy.
[09:30.380 --> 09:32.600]  Gavin, can I say something? Can I say something in your defense?
[09:33.100 --> 09:33.240]  Yeah.
[09:33.780 --> 09:39.800]  As a man who has endeavored to never eat another corn dog as long as he's live, as long as he lives.
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.620]  And he's a good five years down that road at this point, I would say, and happier because of it.
[09:44.820 --> 09:48.660]  I support you ending a bageling in your life.
[09:49.480 --> 09:53.920]  Because even if there's a better bagel out there, and there's always gonna be a better bagel.
[09:54.100 --> 09:58.240]  No matter how good of a bagel you find, there's always a better bagel to chase.
[09:58.660 --> 10:00.160]  That's just the way the world works.
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.960]  But if you're consistently getting 7 out of 10s and that's disappointing to you, then shoo those bagels.
[10:07.260 --> 10:14.480]  Replace them with a breakfast taco or a kolache or a fucking oatmeal or whatever other breakfast food you want to have.
[10:14.600 --> 10:16.920]  And bring yourself up to an 8 or 9 every day.
[10:16.960 --> 10:21.800]  Don't listen to these other guys that are telling you you gotta eat 7s the rest of your life and you should be happy with a fucking 7.
[10:22.140 --> 10:23.500]  You don't need to do that.
[10:23.840 --> 10:25.020]  Life is short.
[10:25.480 --> 10:28.340]  Your life is very short, Gavin.
[10:28.340 --> 10:34.240]  You need to enjoy your taste buds as much as you possibly can over the next few years.
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.540]  I appreciate the very sinister defense that you ended with there.
[10:37.640 --> 10:37.940]  Absolutely.
[10:38.220 --> 10:42.820]  I feel like this podcast is a nice safe space to be announcing our retirement from certain food.
[10:42.880 --> 10:44.640]  I feel like some people have done it.
[10:44.720 --> 10:44.920]  Sure.
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.360]  I'm just throwing it in.
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.440]  I think for me it was two things.
[10:49.560 --> 10:51.260]  It was one, that's a high scale.
[10:51.680 --> 10:55.920]  I think if you would have just said I'm a big toast guy now, it would have been less jarring to me.
[10:56.260 --> 10:58.260]  Than you retiring bagels on a high end scale.
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.980]  And also the other thing, of you trying to score higher, like being worried about being above a 7.
[11:04.420 --> 11:08.980]  Coming from the guy that if he could would just eat a flavorless nutrient cube every day.
[11:09.480 --> 11:11.760]  Like it's just, it's hard.
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.340]  Like this pursuit of more than 7 in the food realm.
[11:15.500 --> 11:18.560]  It feels like a thing you don't care about generally.
[11:19.600 --> 11:20.600]  Such a good point.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.260]  Just any food opinions by you, I'm kind of rattled by.
[11:25.580 --> 11:29.300]  Yeah, especially, is it a flavor, so it's like not the flavor thing.
[11:29.640 --> 11:31.920]  It's just like, it's the chew of it.
[11:32.100 --> 11:34.420]  Like you like the flavor of the bagel.
[11:36.700 --> 11:37.380]  Who, me?
[11:37.940 --> 11:38.400]  Yes.
[11:40.980 --> 11:41.800]  There you go.
[11:41.940 --> 11:45.580]  Hey, you know what, just edit my shit out, who cares.
[11:46.980 --> 11:49.380]  Cause it sounded like you're really excited about toast.
[11:50.980 --> 11:54.580]  That's just an example of like, there's a greater range for me with toast.
[11:55.060 --> 11:55.460]  Like what?
[11:58.620 --> 12:00.960]  He hits toast home runs from time to time.
[12:01.020 --> 12:03.180]  He gets 10 toasts, but he never gets a 10 bagel.
[12:03.700 --> 12:04.040]  I get that.
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.680]  This is really along the same lines as I just think apples are a 6 out of 10 in general.
[12:08.740 --> 12:09.860]  And the ceiling is low.
[12:09.980 --> 12:10.940]  This is targeting now.
[12:11.220 --> 12:11.900]  Now this is targeting.
[12:12.320 --> 12:13.680]  Do you guys think, I have a question for you.
[12:13.780 --> 12:17.280]  Gavin says bagels are a 7 out of 10 and that seems to be acceptable for some of you.
[12:17.900 --> 12:20.880]  Do you think that the scale changes for time of day?
[12:21.200 --> 12:26.560]  Like, do you think it's more acceptable to have a 7 out of 10 for lunch than it is for breakfast or for dinner?
[12:26.940 --> 12:32.120]  Because I feel like if you're gonna have an 8 or a 9 or a 10 out of 10, it needs to be at breakfast.
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.020]  Oh, really? I was gonna say dinner should be the highest ranking of the day.
[12:35.300 --> 12:36.320]  Dinner's the highest ranking.
[12:36.560 --> 12:40.240]  I feel like breakfast is the fuel that carries me through the day.
[12:40.680 --> 12:43.540]  And if I start bad, then I'm gonna have a bad day.
[12:43.620 --> 12:45.780]  But if I start strong, I finish strong.
[12:46.140 --> 12:47.200]  It definitely sets off the day.
[12:47.260 --> 12:49.060]  But I feel like dinner is where the money's spent.
[12:49.080 --> 12:50.620]  Those are the more expensive meals.
[12:50.720 --> 12:51.900]  They take the longest to make.
[12:52.420 --> 12:53.080]  I'm with Gavin.
[12:53.780 --> 12:58.300]  Dinner is when I tend to look up and I'm like, ah, fuck, Emily comes home in an hour and we don't have anything.
[12:58.300 --> 13:02.260]  I gotta throw some pasta together or a fucking order a pizza or whatever.
[13:02.340 --> 13:03.800]  And it's always like...
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.640]  I can't imagine a dinner bagel.
[13:07.020 --> 13:07.960]  That's wild to me.
[13:08.020 --> 13:08.820]  Oh, interesting.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.460]  I bet there'd be potato on it somewhere.
[13:11.460 --> 13:12.700]  Oh, a potagle?
[13:14.660 --> 13:15.580]  Potagle's a great name.
[13:15.940 --> 13:17.120]  Potagle's a fucking awesome.
[13:17.460 --> 13:24.720]  You know when a rocket goes into space and it shoots up and then it drops the thrusters or whatever to continue going?
[13:25.080 --> 13:26.020]  Like it drops whatever.
[13:26.220 --> 13:27.460]  I don't know how fucking rockets work.
[13:27.460 --> 13:29.120]  You just explained it.
[13:29.320 --> 13:30.140]  They use thrusters and then they drop it.
[13:30.160 --> 13:31.820]  Jettisons its boosters and all that.
[13:32.020 --> 13:34.900]  Yeah, that's what the bagel is to the day to me.
[13:35.120 --> 13:36.640]  Like, you don't need that.
[13:36.740 --> 13:38.140]  You need that to get going.
[13:38.580 --> 13:39.780]  That's not a later thing.
[13:40.280 --> 13:44.300]  You have it, it propels you forward, and then you just move on.
[13:44.500 --> 13:49.740]  I also feel like if you have a shitty dinner, you're like, eh, I'll just make up for it on dessert, you know, or whatever.
[13:49.920 --> 13:52.080]  Whereas if I have a shitty breakfast, I'm already full.
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.100]  I don't want to eat anymore.
[13:53.400 --> 13:55.220]  I gotta wait hours till it's lunchtime.
[13:55.220 --> 14:01.180]  Yesterday, I went for, I treated myself to coffee and tacos at Desnudo.
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.100]  I sent you that photo of the little campfire at Desnudo, which was fucking cool on a cold day.
[14:05.200 --> 14:10.140]  All coffee shops should have an outdoor campfire, so you feel like you're fucking making s'mores while you're drinking your coffee.
[14:10.140 --> 14:20.700]  But I had two tacos from Veracruz, which is the best taco truck in Austin, and they were both 7 out of 10.
[14:21.020 --> 14:28.160]  And I was so fucking bummed out for the entire rest of the day that this morning, I always get my tacos from Veracruz.
[14:28.360 --> 14:30.660]  I was like, I can't do it today. I had to go somewhere else.
[14:35.600 --> 14:40.100]  Now, sorry, back on the range thing, just for a minute. I'm still trying to process this range.
[14:40.920 --> 14:46.280]  You want lower and higher? Is that the thing, the risk of low is worth it for you to go above a 7?
[14:46.900 --> 14:50.980]  I just don't like a low ceiling. I don't want my ranges trapped between 1 and 7.
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.440]  Okay, I just know we have a different definition of ceiling, I guess, for low ceiling.
[14:55.820 --> 14:57.180]  What's your definition of the ceiling?
[14:57.800 --> 14:59.440]  A low ceiling to me is a 5.
[15:00.080 --> 15:01.420]  Oh, like just how low? Okay.
[15:01.940 --> 15:02.260]  Yeah.
[15:02.620 --> 15:10.680]  If the ceiling is 5, there's no, like, I would never find it. Like, how would you even get to the floor?
[15:11.860 --> 15:15.240]  To discover the 5. I mean, like, a 5 right on my radar.
[15:16.020 --> 15:19.780]  If you try a new food, that's where you're finding your ceiling.
[15:19.940 --> 15:24.480]  You're like, if you have like a food that people are excited about, you're like, I don't know.
[15:24.780 --> 15:26.400]  It didn't connect for me. That was like a 3.
[15:26.880 --> 15:30.920]  But you give it another try and maybe you hit a 5. Like, that's to me when you retire food.
[15:31.960 --> 15:33.260]  So your cutoff is 5?
[15:34.120 --> 15:39.100]  I think so. Yeah, I think I would stop. I'd be willing to retire something if it was consistently a 5.
[15:39.460 --> 15:41.460]  I understand that. And I would retire something at 5.
[15:41.580 --> 15:48.460]  I was more surprised that I can't find above a 7 and I'm therefore going to have to retire at 7, which is quite high to retire.
[15:48.580 --> 15:51.360]  That is wild. I think we could find you a better bagel.
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.980]  I really don't think it's that high to retire.
[15:52.980 --> 15:56.520]  I think if we go deep in the bagel depth chart, we can find you an 8.
[15:57.940 --> 16:01.580]  I'm willing to try. I'll get back in the bagel ring. In the ring.
[16:02.180 --> 16:07.840]  I think your best shot in town is probably Biedermann's. Over on the north, up north, far west somewhere.
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.160]  Group trip? Yeah, yeah. I'll go get some pastrami.
[16:12.940 --> 16:18.840]  I feel like Andrew, you'd have to go to your new favorite bagel place on your island.
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.740]  I really appreciate Nick immediately pushing for the food road trip.
[16:25.020 --> 16:29.440]  That's his heart and soul. That's his blood. Yeah, that's what he wants.
[16:29.740 --> 16:34.040]  Well, maybe we could do that the same day we construct our potagel and make a dinner bagel.
[16:34.300 --> 16:40.580]  Ooh, yeah. A smashed potagel. Maybe a baked potagel.
[16:41.180 --> 16:42.300]  Potatoes needs a sequel.
[16:42.800 --> 16:49.620]  Maybe Nick can do the red boots that day. Really build, like, a need to eat an appetite.
[16:49.720 --> 16:52.980]  The mall and the bagel shop are on opposite sides of town, unfortunately.
[16:54.580 --> 17:02.100]  Jeff, when we went and got hot dogs the other day, you confessed to me and Nick that you were really sad that we didn't talk about potato stuff on the last episode.
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.320]  Oh, I did, but I deleted all my potato notes after we had that conversation.
[17:07.880 --> 17:10.560]  Why? Why? What? I just teed you up!
[17:10.980 --> 17:16.640]  Because you convinced me we'd already talked about it. You said it sounded familiar, and I thought, oh, I must have just remembered it wrong, so I deleted it all.
[17:16.920 --> 17:18.220]  Why? Why delete?
[17:19.680 --> 17:27.480]  Uh, you're right. I probably shouldn't have. I was just cleaning up my notes today, and I thought, don't need those. It wasn't like it was a 7 out of 10, so I've retired it.
[17:32.020 --> 17:35.860]  It was just a couple of potato recipes. I don't remember what they were, though.
[17:37.000 --> 17:44.620]  Do you think this is a 7 out of 10 episode that people are listening to right now? Like this might be our low ceiling?
[17:44.980 --> 17:50.280]  Please don't retire us from your listening. Give your ears one more chance.
[17:50.760 --> 17:53.320]  I mean, we're only 20 minutes in. It could go up or down from here.
[17:53.680 --> 17:54.000]  That's true.

[18:47.780 --> 18:51.040]  On the topic of food, I had a morning thought that was food-related.
[18:51.940 --> 18:54.120]  Where do popcorn seeds come from?
[18:55.140 --> 18:56.540]  Like a maze?
[18:57.260 --> 18:58.880]  What? I still don't know.
[18:58.880 --> 19:03.280]  What are you... what are you saying?
[19:03.580 --> 19:05.580]  You're not being honest with us right now.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.820]  Help me! Help! What's happening?
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.680]  You're not being truthful when you say that to us right now.
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.460]  No, no, no, let me fully explain this to you. Let me talk to you through my thought process.
[19:17.460 --> 19:23.000]  I woke up. I thought, because I was... I had a stomachache yesterday.
[19:23.160 --> 19:27.920]  Is it related to the fact I ate like a one pound bag of popcorn? Who can say? I don't know.
[19:28.540 --> 19:31.800]  But I was thinking about how much popcorn I ate.
[19:32.040 --> 19:35.740]  And could I equate that to a single thing of corn on the cob?
[19:36.300 --> 19:39.640]  Like if I were to translate each little, little thing, each little...
[19:39.980 --> 19:43.240]  If I imagine each little... I don't even know what to call it. Nugget? Corn nugget?
[19:43.600 --> 19:44.980]  Kernel! Kernel! Kernel!
[19:44.980 --> 19:46.180]  No! Okay.
[19:47.860 --> 19:50.980]  If I converted that kernel to kernel...
[19:52.260 --> 19:56.040]  How many kernels are in a cob? And then how many in relation... because you just don't have a number.
[19:56.440 --> 20:02.860]  And then it got me thinking about popcorn seeds. And I've never... I've been to corn maze and I've never seen seeds.
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.960]  Why do you keep saying, what's going on? What's going on?
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.160]  A large bag of popcorn would have about 29 ears of corn in it.
[20:14.160 --> 20:16.620]  Yeah, are you serious?!
[20:16.620 --> 20:22.080]  800 kernels on 16 rows on an ear of corn varies between 500 to 1200.
[20:22.780 --> 20:26.860]  Yeah, that's just one to one. I don't know what... are you talking?
[20:27.140 --> 20:29.040]  Okay, so if I...
[20:29.040 --> 20:31.280]  So yesterday you ate 30 ears of corn.
[20:31.880 --> 20:35.900]  Oh, I ate way more than that, dude. I probably took down a field. It was insane.
[20:36.160 --> 20:37.260]  Why'd you eat so much popcorn?
[20:37.680 --> 20:43.460]  I bought this extra large bag from a place and I just... I was a salt maniac. I just couldn't stop.
[20:44.740 --> 20:47.400]  I love it. Can't get enough.
[20:47.860 --> 20:55.940]  That's like when you live in Texas for a while and you're eating tortilla chips constantly at every... as a fucking free appetizer at every restaurant in town.
[20:56.140 --> 21:02.540]  And you just like house and bag... like container after container of chip. And then somebody goes, you know what tortilla chips are, right?
[21:02.580 --> 21:06.260]  They're just tortillas. And you're like, I just ate 86 tortillas.
[21:06.960 --> 21:07.700]  That's crazy.
[21:08.100 --> 21:11.080]  Have you ever eaten just a whole cob of corn there?
[21:11.520 --> 21:12.060]  Yeah, of course.
[21:12.420 --> 21:13.820]  Yeah. It's not hard.
[21:13.820 --> 21:17.040]  Like eating a tenth of a bag of popcorn.
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.460]  That's crazy. You ate all those popcorn seeds? That's nuts.
[21:21.060 --> 21:22.460]  Well, is that where the seeds come from?
[21:22.760 --> 21:24.100]  Stop saying seeds!
[21:25.160 --> 21:26.340]  Are they not seeds?
[21:28.460 --> 21:31.720]  Okay, how do you grow corn?
[21:33.440 --> 21:38.760]  I have to... I don't know that I've ever wanted to quit the show. This might be the first.
[21:39.060 --> 21:42.340]  This is absolutely nuts. You can't be for real.
[21:42.340 --> 21:43.760]  Well, there goes the seven.
[21:47.300 --> 21:50.760]  Are we... listen, I didn't know we're fucking all agriculture experts over here.
[21:51.740 --> 21:54.460]  I've walked through a corn maze. I've eaten plenty of corn.
[21:55.880 --> 21:59.820]  Maze, as some call it. If we want to get fancy, we want to get into the culinary term.
[22:01.060 --> 22:01.800]  How do you grow it?
[22:02.480 --> 22:07.360]  What are you talking about? Ground? What? What do you mean?
[22:07.900 --> 22:10.340]  Okay, so if I'm going to...
[22:10.340 --> 22:11.240]  Corn! Corn!
[22:11.660 --> 22:14.140]  I see where you're coming from now.
[22:14.340 --> 22:20.940]  If I'm going to grow, let's say, a tree, I need a seed to do it.
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.060]  What is the base? What's the base corn? What does corn grow from?
[22:27.380 --> 22:29.520]  Like the sapling stage?
[22:30.340 --> 22:30.680]  Yeah!
[22:31.380 --> 22:35.120]  Like there's a field. Okay, I decide I want to be a corn farmer.
[22:35.120 --> 22:40.980]  I get my... I got my dirt. I got all my dirt and then I prepare it for things to grow in it.
[22:41.300 --> 22:42.540]  What am I putting in the ground?
[22:42.860 --> 22:43.840]  You want me to show you?
[22:44.400 --> 22:44.740]  Yes.
[22:46.280 --> 22:49.560]  Okay, that's what I was curious about. Is that...
[22:49.560 --> 22:53.100]  So the kernels are where you grow corn from.
[22:53.860 --> 23:00.800]  Each kernel of corn is actually a seed that, like most seeds, contains an embryo and a seed coat for protection.
[23:01.680 --> 23:02.180]  Interesting.
[23:02.960 --> 23:04.300]  Not that interesting.
[23:04.820 --> 23:11.200]  Name another food where you just purely eat the thing that creates more of it.
[23:11.700 --> 23:12.220]  Beans?
[23:12.580 --> 23:13.660]  Oh shit, okay.
[23:14.960 --> 23:17.760]  You got there a lot faster than I thought you would.
[23:18.720 --> 23:21.660]  I don't... I don't... This is...
[23:22.480 --> 23:23.040]  Beans?
[23:23.420 --> 23:25.060]  I'm not going to do it. This is a 6 out of 10.
[23:26.480 --> 23:31.820]  I just... I never thought of it. Because I've been to a corn maze, I've never seen just that.
[23:32.560 --> 23:37.220]  So do you... Is... If it... With enough time, does it just turn? Does the kernel just become that?
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.280]  Or is there a process that we do?
[23:42.220 --> 23:45.920]  I don't even... Are you asking if corn comes from corn?
[23:46.320 --> 23:48.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:48.420 --> 23:53.700]  So, the corn at the grocery store, I throw in a pot, I then eat it.
[23:53.700 --> 24:00.520]  If I just were to leave that corn alone, does it become a kernel eventually? Does it, like, harden?
[24:00.920 --> 24:09.260]  Not exactly. Popcorn corn, I think, is genetically altered, so it probably doesn't grow.
[24:09.580 --> 24:12.360]  But originally, yeah. Before science got involved, yeah.
[24:12.960 --> 24:19.700]  Okay. So I couldn't, like, buy a corn and then create my own popcorn, essentially. With enough time.
[24:20.200 --> 24:21.820]  No, I think you probably could that way.
[24:21.920 --> 24:22.160]  Really?
[24:22.160 --> 24:30.520]  You could do it that way. I just don't think you could buy Orville Redenbacher unpopped microwave popcorn, take that corn, and plant it in the ground, and receive...
[24:30.520 --> 24:31.680]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:31.720 --> 24:32.100]  Corn kernels.
[24:32.380 --> 24:33.280]  Now that, I want to try.
[24:33.760 --> 24:34.620]  That would be great.
[24:34.980 --> 24:39.540]  Like, genetically, I don't think that can happen. But the other way around, I think, would, yeah.
[24:40.040 --> 24:50.720]  Okay. I just have never seen a kernel, like, a loose kernel in the field. I went to a lot of corn mazes as a kid, and I just never encountered it, and I just, I figured I'd get an answer here.
[24:50.720 --> 24:52.600]  That one critical piece to the puzzle.
[24:53.060 --> 24:55.460]  Are you saying maze like a maze you walk in?
[24:55.860 --> 24:56.160]  Yeah.
[24:56.560 --> 24:57.000]  Okay.
[24:57.160 --> 24:57.360]  Yeah.
[24:57.900 --> 25:02.780]  Yeah, like a holiday. It was typically October-ish. Spooky corn mazes.
[25:03.360 --> 25:07.960]  This continent loves corn. That's probably going to be my biggest takeaway.
[25:08.180 --> 25:09.020]  Oh, everything's corn.
[25:09.500 --> 25:09.760]  Yeah.
[25:10.280 --> 25:10.860]  It's like 95%.
[25:11.640 --> 25:19.000]  Well, it's like, it's like from here. This is like, it's what corn, corn comes from here. It's like the first thing that we did.
[25:19.140 --> 25:19.620]  Yeah.
[25:20.160 --> 25:25.740]  Like, that's why it's a thing over here and not over there, because it's from over here and not from over there.
[25:25.980 --> 25:27.440]  There's no European corn?
[25:28.380 --> 25:34.560]  I believe that corn originated in Mesoamerica and then moved, like, was taken to Europe.
[25:34.880 --> 25:37.620]  I mean, we don't have raccoons either. We're missing out.
[25:39.560 --> 25:40.900]  You have raccoons in Europe?
[25:41.200 --> 25:44.920]  Your two biggest regrets are raccoons and corn.
[25:47.620 --> 25:49.980]  You guys also don't really have peanut butter, do you?
[25:50.660 --> 25:51.080]  Oh, really?
[25:51.680 --> 25:52.680]  Yeah, we don't.
[25:52.760 --> 25:54.340]  That's not a thing over there. I think it's weird.
[25:54.360 --> 25:55.060]  It's not a thing, yeah.
[25:55.440 --> 25:57.360]  Peanut butter is everywhere. We just don't have it with chocolate.
[25:57.980 --> 25:58.240]  What?
[25:58.400 --> 25:58.640]  Really?
[25:58.960 --> 26:01.400]  But you guys don't have, like, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, right?
[26:02.320 --> 26:08.420]  Uh, well, okay. What is, what is the default jelly flavor?
[26:09.340 --> 26:09.700]  Strawberry.
[26:10.220 --> 26:10.360]  Grape.
[26:10.360 --> 26:10.800]  And grape.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.820]  Strawberry and grape, I'd say it's 50-50.
[26:12.820 --> 26:15.080]  Meg was saying it was grape first.
[26:15.500 --> 26:17.980]  Yeah, it's grape first. It's grape first.
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.000]  But what England is very lacking is the grape flavor. I don't find grape flavored anything.
[26:24.020 --> 26:24.340]  It sucks.
[26:24.700 --> 26:25.260]  It does suck.
[26:25.280 --> 26:25.560]  Really?
[26:25.940 --> 26:26.420]  Disgraceful.
[26:26.680 --> 26:29.560]  It doesn't suck, but it's a lower tier flavor.
[26:29.860 --> 26:32.660]  I disagree. I think it's a better flavor than strawberry.
[26:33.780 --> 26:35.740]  Doesn't taste like grapes, though.
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.140]  Grape jelly's pretty good. I don't know if it's better than strawberry jelly. Pretty good.
[26:41.940 --> 26:44.780]  You think if you got grape jelly, the raccoons would show up?
[26:45.540 --> 26:49.000]  Oh, do you think one follows the other? Didn't even think about that. Smart.
[26:49.460 --> 26:54.500]  If I plant a jar of grape jelly...
[26:54.500 --> 26:56.740]  Where do the grape seeds come from?
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.880]  Build it and they will come. You gotta get all those raccoons. And give them your bagels that you don't want.
[27:05.480 --> 27:11.020]  Erika, was it you that posted that there's a raccoon in Chicken Horse?
[27:11.920 --> 27:12.280]  What?
[27:13.160 --> 27:13.380]  What?
[27:13.660 --> 27:15.360]  The new game? Is that what you're saying?
[27:16.260 --> 27:18.520]  Are you talking about the new game? The racing game?
[27:18.640 --> 27:21.760]  Because there is a raccoon in Chicken Horse, but there always has been. I don't know.
[27:22.100 --> 27:25.540]  We're trying to parse what you said and you're not responding to any of it.
[27:25.660 --> 27:28.060]  So what you were posting was like a trailer for a new game?
[27:28.060 --> 27:32.180]  Yeah, it's called Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, I think, or something like that.
[27:32.260 --> 27:40.200]  And it's Ultimate Chicken Horse, but like on little vehicles and it looks difficult.
[27:40.460 --> 27:43.960]  It's like a side scroller for Makeway, which I guess you didn't play.
[27:44.540 --> 27:46.340]  No, I've never played that. He hasn't played it yet.
[27:46.400 --> 27:49.100]  Yeah, because you posted that and I was like, I hadn't watched it.
[27:49.280 --> 27:51.600]  But I was like, I'm pretty sure there was already a raccoon in that game.
[27:51.820 --> 27:55.140]  Well, no, the game is called Ultimate Sheep Raccoon.
[27:55.140 --> 27:57.900]  Yeah, I understand now. I was just clarifying.
[27:58.440 --> 28:00.180]  Yeah, and so am I right now to you.
[28:01.020 --> 28:04.400]  It'd be like if Eric posted a trailer for the Master Chief collection.
[28:04.560 --> 28:06.780]  Gavin's like, pretty sure Master Chief is already in this.
[28:08.960 --> 28:10.920]  I'm pretty sure he's already in there. Stay in this.
[28:12.500 --> 28:16.020]  Hey, do you know, since we're talking about corn and weird food things,
[28:16.220 --> 28:20.280]  I read on Reddit the other day, do you guys know what an individual M&M is called?
[28:21.620 --> 28:21.820]  No.
[28:21.820 --> 28:22.660]  Like they have a name.
[28:23.140 --> 28:23.460]  Really?
[28:23.460 --> 28:24.140]  Yeah.
[28:24.520 --> 28:25.320]  What are they?
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.100]  Apparently an individual form of spaghetti.
[28:29.340 --> 28:32.580]  The singular form of spaghetti is a spaghetto, which I didn't know.
[28:32.960 --> 28:38.620]  But also M&M's, they're not M's, they're an individual M&M,
[28:38.760 --> 28:43.920]  according to the Mars Corporation, say they are officially referred to as lentils.
[28:44.860 --> 28:45.380]  Lentils?
[28:45.840 --> 28:46.100]  Yeah.
[28:46.420 --> 28:49.600]  So when you're eating M&M's, you're eating lentils, which is weird.
[28:49.680 --> 28:51.860]  Can I grow them? If I bury them?
[28:51.860 --> 28:56.500]  I think genetically, I think if you buy M&M's, I'm not sure which way it works.
[28:58.960 --> 29:00.200]  Anyway, I thought that was real stupid.
[29:00.440 --> 29:01.400]  That is.
[29:01.720 --> 29:05.880]  Well, I think what originally happened was people thought that,
[29:06.540 --> 29:13.080]  and the thing that was spoken about a lot is that one Skittle, people said was called a lentil.
[29:13.320 --> 29:16.920]  And then the Skittle people said, no, one Skittle is a Skittles.
[29:17.320 --> 29:20.720]  They are always a Skittle. It's always Skittles, no matter how many there are.
[29:21.520 --> 29:25.440]  And then M&M came out and said, oh yeah, one M&M is called a lentil.
[29:25.540 --> 29:26.980]  And everyone flipped out.
[29:27.580 --> 29:32.700]  Hey, while we're talking about food, I have another note I had written down here at Thanksgiving.
[29:33.240 --> 29:38.300]  I meant to talk to you guys about, I think I have a way we can innovate on a popular food.
[29:38.940 --> 29:40.840]  And we wouldn't be the first to do it.
[29:40.900 --> 29:43.980]  I'm not saying we have invented this, but I don't think it's popular.
[29:44.040 --> 29:45.540]  And I think we could popularize it.
[29:45.540 --> 29:50.040]  And while doing so, create some cool flavors.
[29:51.060 --> 29:53.320]  When we were in Thanksgiving, we were looking for a place to eat.
[29:55.860 --> 29:59.700]  Emily's sister's kids wanted to eat soup out of a bread bowl,
[29:59.880 --> 30:02.560]  which I remember being a really big deal for Millie when she was a kid.
[30:02.680 --> 30:05.460]  We would go to this restaurant that always had tomato soup in a bread bowl.
[30:05.540 --> 30:07.620]  I know this is hard for you, Gav. I apologize.
[30:07.800 --> 30:09.480]  But it's going to go drier, I promise.
[30:09.840 --> 30:10.100]  Thanks.
[30:11.880 --> 30:15.000]  I got to thinking about it, and they were joking around about other stuff to put in a bread bowl,
[30:15.100 --> 30:17.280]  and they said they wanted to eat spaghetti out of a bread bowl.
[30:17.400 --> 30:19.680]  And I thought, that's kind of brilliant, so I started looking for it.
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.460]  And there are recipes for bread bowl spaghetti, but I've never been to a restaurant
[30:24.960 --> 30:30.100]  and been able to order spaghetti out of a, think about it, a garlic bread bowl?
[30:31.880 --> 30:33.320]  How amazing would that be?
[30:33.340 --> 30:34.480]  Disgusting. That sounds awful.
[30:34.680 --> 30:37.320]  I think it sounds awesome! Nick thinks it sounds awesome!
[30:37.760 --> 30:39.560]  Garlic bread goes with spaghetti!
[30:40.340 --> 30:44.300]  You get it in its own bowl, it's in its own container, you get to eat the container, it's like a taco salad.
[30:44.560 --> 30:45.160]  Win-win!
[30:45.520 --> 30:46.400]  Oh, Jeff!
[30:48.060 --> 30:48.920]  Oh, man.
[30:49.120 --> 30:52.100]  Yeah, there's a picture, because they do exist. Like I said, I'm not inventing it.
[30:52.240 --> 30:56.580]  I think we can popularize it, because I don't think it's popular, and I think it should and could be.
[30:56.900 --> 31:02.400]  I'm on the side of, if spaghetti's not presented normally to me, it looks repulsive.
[31:02.960 --> 31:04.700]  I feel the same way, yes.
[31:05.080 --> 31:05.400]  Really?
[31:05.400 --> 31:09.140]  I wouldn't want to eat either of that. I assume separately it'd be fine.
[31:09.140 --> 31:13.040]  I'm with you. Here, Gavin, you're gonna fucking hate this one.
[31:13.400 --> 31:13.520]  Okay.
[31:13.620 --> 31:18.560]  Well, you also keep in mind, Gavin doesn't like wet bread, and Eric doesn't like spaghetti.
[31:19.020 --> 31:19.380]  It's true.
[31:19.380 --> 31:22.400]  So this might not be for the both of you, but for the both of you.
[31:23.580 --> 31:24.500]  I didn't know that!
[31:24.920 --> 31:25.680]  No, I don't like spaghetti.
[31:26.180 --> 31:26.920]  Holy shit!
[31:27.200 --> 31:29.120]  I think it's the worst form of pasta.
[31:29.120 --> 31:36.120]  Firstly, how dare you? Secondly, what don't you like about spaghetti, just like a bowl of eggs?
[31:36.560 --> 31:41.780]  I just don't think it, like, compared to other pastas, I don't think it holds sauce as well.
[31:41.960 --> 31:45.460]  I just think it's insufficient at what it's trying to achieve.
[31:45.620 --> 31:50.260]  Even, like, a really, really good spaghetti just kind of pales in comparison to most other pastas.
[31:50.480 --> 31:52.180]  Like a 7 out of 10 experience?
[31:52.720 --> 31:54.700]  No, it's like a 4 out of 10.
[31:54.800 --> 31:56.580]  The whole reason I know this...
[31:56.580 --> 31:57.060]  I think we've talked about it on this show.
[31:57.060 --> 32:04.020]  Yeah, we have, because I won dinner one day, and I picked spaghetti because I knew you didn't like it, and you were fucking bummed out.
[32:04.740 --> 32:06.060]  I was, it's true.
[32:06.680 --> 32:08.700]  You've never gone above a 4 on spaghetti?
[32:08.960 --> 32:09.120]  That's so funny.
[32:09.560 --> 32:10.520]  Absolutely insane.
[32:10.900 --> 32:14.480]  I just think it's a sub-par pasta for what it's trying to...
[32:14.480 --> 32:18.100]  Like, I just think every other pasta, like, does the job better.
[32:18.360 --> 32:20.180]  Well, I feel like spaghetti's the first one.
[32:20.920 --> 32:23.000]  That's pasta number one, it's just the standard.
[32:23.100 --> 32:24.420]  Yeah, the gateway.
[32:24.620 --> 32:27.020]  The vanilla ice cream of pastas, if you will.
[32:27.700 --> 32:31.560]  That would be an interesting game, actually, finding out the vanilla of each food.
[32:31.660 --> 32:33.240]  Oh, that is so...
[32:33.240 --> 32:34.920]  Oh, that's such a good idea.
[32:35.120 --> 32:36.420]  What if we do a vanilla draft?
[32:36.880 --> 32:37.580]  Let's do it!
[32:37.680 --> 32:38.660]  Alright, vanilla draft.
[32:38.880 --> 32:39.460]  Alright, hang on.
[32:40.060 --> 32:40.980]  Hang on, I'm writing it down.
[32:41.880 --> 32:46.020]  Maybe it doesn't have to be food, maybe it could be just the first...
[32:46.940 --> 32:49.160]  The 101 of different things.
[32:49.260 --> 32:50.720]  Yeah, it's the gateway, right?
[32:50.960 --> 32:52.900]  Yeah, the gateway food. I like that.
[32:54.260 --> 32:59.900]  Spaghetti in a bread bowl turns Eric and Gavin into, like, the Batman and Robin of hating a thing.
[33:00.260 --> 33:01.280]  Just united.
[33:01.680 --> 33:03.260]  That's what I wanted to take it down.
[33:04.040 --> 33:07.520]  It's not often just those two are united in an argument, it's interesting.
[33:08.560 --> 33:09.700]  That is a great point.
[33:10.060 --> 33:12.120]  It's like having a video with just Gavin and Nick.
[33:12.160 --> 33:15.700]  I want to see it so bad, but it's just not a combination you get.
[33:16.800 --> 33:17.280]  Oh, it's coming.
[33:17.880 --> 33:20.420]  We've done Nick, Jeff, and me.
[33:21.000 --> 33:21.320]  It's true.
[33:22.560 --> 33:25.980]  We did Eric, Nick, and Jeff last week, and I thought that went really well.
[33:26.120 --> 33:30.300]  Yeah, I mean, having Jeff in there, I think, just has a buffer.
[33:30.400 --> 33:32.680]  I just want to know what Gavin and Nick would do.
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.140]  Like, if they were just to, like, do something.
[33:35.360 --> 33:38.340]  I've made content with just me and Jeff, and just me and Andrew.
[33:38.500 --> 33:40.440]  But I've never done anything even with just you.
[33:42.460 --> 33:43.520]  I guess that's true.
[33:43.840 --> 33:44.680]  I think you'd hate it.
[33:45.160 --> 33:47.300]  No, I think we could do it and it would be fine.
[33:47.300 --> 33:53.840]  I just want to know where Nick would take you, or vice versa, and what that would be.
[33:54.360 --> 33:59.320]  The next episode of Regulation Tune-Up we record is Gavin and Nick as a team.
[33:59.660 --> 34:00.720]  Oh, that's going to be bad.
[34:00.720 --> 34:02.880]  And I cannot wait to see.
[34:02.980 --> 34:05.780]  It's got to be like a food pendulum.
[34:07.480 --> 34:12.240]  Where one of them is a 1 of 10, and the other thinks it's 10 of 10, and they have to come to the middle somehow and agree.
[34:13.460 --> 34:14.180]  Food pendulum.
[34:14.500 --> 34:20.980]  I'm trying to think of Mario Party mini-game team-ups I've had with Nick, and have they gone well?
[34:22.880 --> 34:26.140]  Because GTA, you're not on a team with Nick. It's Nick and I.
[34:27.740 --> 34:30.580]  Mario Party, I don't feel like you ever had an alliance with Nick either.
[34:30.680 --> 34:31.460]  I don't think we did.
[34:31.540 --> 34:32.740]  We never did, like, cut the meat?
[34:34.020 --> 34:34.900]  No, we did once.
[34:35.280 --> 34:37.160]  Oh yeah, you guys definitely did.
[34:37.380 --> 34:38.840]  Oh yeah, because Andrew and I were partners a bunch.
[34:38.920 --> 34:39.900]  Yeah, we tied.
[34:39.900 --> 34:43.360]  Yeah, we beat you guys in the jerk-off games consistently.
[34:43.780 --> 34:45.180]  That's pretty cool, man. Way to go.
[34:45.600 --> 34:47.640]  I think Jeff and I beat you in rowing.
[34:48.260 --> 34:48.660]  Yeah.
[34:49.420 --> 34:51.520]  Speaking of jerking off, I got something with that too later.
[34:51.840 --> 34:52.060]  Oh.
[34:52.200 --> 34:55.040]  Really? I mean, we can just get to it right now if you like.
[34:55.140 --> 34:57.220]  No, we're having fun talking about whatever we're talking about.
[34:57.880 --> 35:09.760]  What if we recorded an episode one day where we all had like a slider from 1 to 10 open, and we all streamed our view, and we would keep it updated with how the episode's going on where it lies out of 10.
[35:09.760 --> 35:11.860]  That's like a sliding scale.
[35:11.900 --> 35:12.460]  I think that's a terrible idea.
[35:12.700 --> 35:13.440]  It's pretty good.
[35:13.900 --> 35:14.580]  You guys just...
[35:14.580 --> 35:15.000]  It's insane.
[35:15.300 --> 35:16.900]  I would, yeah, that would be a terrible idea.
[35:17.000 --> 35:17.960]  I'm gonna be at a 3 all the time.
[35:18.300 --> 35:19.760]  You would never like...
[35:19.760 --> 35:21.340]  I never feel good about our content.
[35:23.900 --> 35:26.960]  It would just sit on 3 for the whole episode, no matter what we said.
[35:26.980 --> 35:29.420]  It would probably bump up to 4 or 5 every once in a while, Andrew.
[35:29.520 --> 35:37.100]  See, I imagine we'd all start at 5, and then Andrew would come in saying, you know, what's a corn seed, and I would immediately slide it up to an 8.
[35:38.600 --> 35:40.080]  I'd go down to a 3.
[35:41.180 --> 35:42.560]  See, it averages out.
[35:42.940 --> 35:52.200]  Jeff would be telling like the Go Go Now level of just hilarious story that only Jeff is capable of, and then he'd lower his number to a 2.
[35:52.560 --> 35:53.400]  It would just be sad.
[35:53.660 --> 35:54.420]  It would just be depressing.
[35:54.900 --> 36:04.700]  Because it would deserve it, because I would have fucked the story up in some way that you guys don't understand, but I do, because it's my story, and I know how bad I fumbled the fucking bag,
[36:04.700 --> 36:15.100]  and it'll fucking plague me for the rest of my goddamn life, like when we fell down that mountain on that fucking horse, which is a better story than Go Go Now, but I shit the bed.
[36:16.120 --> 36:17.320]  Still upset about it.
[36:17.380 --> 36:21.360]  You nailed the bathrobe dog lockout hotel losing turkey bit.
[36:21.380 --> 36:22.060]  Oh, that was good.
[36:22.160 --> 36:23.540]  Oh, that's a baby story.
[36:24.080 --> 36:26.580]  I didn't see the turkey being left in the fridge. That was a good twist.
[36:27.340 --> 36:28.940]  That would have bumped some numbers for me.
[36:28.940 --> 36:39.480]  So it'll be interesting at the end of us live sliding for the whole episode, we take the end result, and we just up front say this is a, you know, a 7.3 out of 10 episode.
[36:40.520 --> 36:42.840]  Take the averages, people know what they're gonna get up front.
[36:44.920 --> 36:48.700]  I feel like we need some... Mick, what would be your average number?
[36:50.020 --> 36:50.660]  To start?
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.560]  Yeah, because I feel like you're the most optimistic of all of us.
[36:53.940 --> 36:56.120]  Oh, I'd start probably at a 7, and then go from there.
[36:56.460 --> 36:58.160]  You think we're a 7 out of the gate?
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.460]  See, that's the thing. We need somebody to be the opposite of Jeff to try to create the average.
[37:02.760 --> 37:03.220]  Oh, I see.
[37:03.820 --> 37:06.120]  But I instantly go to a 10 once I laugh, so, you know.
[37:06.740 --> 37:07.620]  You would have lost.
[37:07.780 --> 37:09.240]  So you'd have been a 10. That's great.
[37:09.700 --> 37:10.880]  On the intro of this one.
[37:11.380 --> 37:12.100]  Yeah, it was a good intro.
[37:16.870 --> 37:20.310]  I, uh... I've been watching a lot of movies recently.
[37:20.870 --> 37:24.630]  Because I had a little bit of time off, so I was trying to catch up on some things.
[37:25.270 --> 37:28.930]  I've been watching... I caught up on all the Mission Impossibles that I hadn't seen.
[37:28.930 --> 37:30.670]  I'd missed four of those.
[37:31.070 --> 37:32.110]  Oh, wow. Shit.
[37:32.430 --> 37:33.110]  That's most of them.
[37:33.110 --> 37:34.250]  I missed... well, which ones did I miss? I missed...
[37:35.350 --> 37:39.690]  Ghost Protocol, and then Fallout, and then Final Rec.
[37:39.750 --> 37:41.590]  So I guess three. I watched three of them.
[37:42.910 --> 37:43.870]  They're all fun.
[37:44.310 --> 37:46.890]  But I realized while watching it, do you remember...
[37:46.890 --> 37:48.770]  And I don't know if you had these commercials, Gavin.
[37:49.430 --> 37:51.850]  And to be honest, they were, I think, before my time even.
[37:52.610 --> 37:54.030]  But the Grey Poupon commercial.
[37:55.890 --> 37:58.610]  When Grey Poupon was trying to take over from Heinz.
[37:58.670 --> 38:00.090]  Trying to get a market share from Heinz.
[38:00.550 --> 38:02.130]  And they're in the, like, limousine.
[38:03.250 --> 38:05.710]  And the rich guy, like, it's the rich guy.
[38:05.890 --> 38:10.250]  They tried to advertise Grey Poupon as, like, the classy mustard.
[38:10.410 --> 38:12.070]  Was their way to try to combat against...
[38:12.830 --> 38:15.130]  It's like a Rolls-Royce pulls up to another Rolls-Royce.
[38:15.170 --> 38:16.250]  And the guy rolls down the window and he says,
[38:16.310 --> 38:17.950]  Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
[38:18.050 --> 38:18.990]  And then the other guy looks at him and goes,
[38:19.130 --> 38:19.890]  But of course.
[38:19.950 --> 38:20.790]  And then he hands it to him.
[38:21.110 --> 38:22.070]  Exactly. Yeah.
[38:22.070 --> 38:25.210]  They're like, listen, this is the rich dude's mustard.
[38:25.350 --> 38:27.590]  If you want to be classy, Grey Poupon.
[38:27.890 --> 38:30.250]  Why does he look like he's about to dip the dog in the jar?
[38:30.810 --> 38:32.690]  Because he loves his Grey Poupon.
[38:32.910 --> 38:34.390]  And that's what rich people do.
[38:36.490 --> 38:41.290]  Mission Impossible is the Grey Poupon of, like, Fast and Furious.
[38:41.810 --> 38:42.590]  It's the same.
[38:42.910 --> 38:44.270]  They're equally dumb.
[38:44.690 --> 38:45.210]  They're just presented...
[38:45.630 --> 38:47.550]  It's presented in a way of, like, this is serious.
[38:48.050 --> 38:49.950]  You nailed it.
[38:50.130 --> 38:51.530]  I never thought about it that way.
[38:51.530 --> 38:52.830]  You're totally right.
[38:53.350 --> 38:55.490]  It's so dumb in a great way.
[38:55.670 --> 38:56.430]  And I enjoy it.
[38:56.450 --> 39:00.670]  But it's like, it has critical prestige in a way the Fast movies don't.
[39:00.950 --> 39:02.410]  But they are equally absurd.
[39:02.550 --> 39:03.950]  Especially as they progress.
[39:04.370 --> 39:08.310]  I didn't realize that they were called the Impossible Mission Force.
[39:08.830 --> 39:10.010]  I'd always heard IMF.
[39:10.090 --> 39:13.350]  There's a moment where they say what it actually stands for.
[39:13.410 --> 39:14.850]  And I was like, this is fucking ridiculous.
[39:15.330 --> 39:16.190]  This is insane.
[39:16.690 --> 39:20.570]  And also, they lose all of their resources every movie.
[39:20.570 --> 39:21.750]  Like, I don't understand.
[39:21.890 --> 39:23.390]  Like, is there other agents?
[39:23.490 --> 39:26.750]  There's so many stupid things about all of these films.
[39:26.890 --> 39:28.110]  But they're a delight.
[39:28.610 --> 39:29.310]  They are a joy.
[39:29.890 --> 39:30.530]  However, I don't know.
[39:30.590 --> 39:32.150]  Have you guys seen all of them?
[39:32.570 --> 39:33.790]  I haven't seen the newest one.
[39:34.330 --> 39:35.530]  They keep...
[39:35.530 --> 39:37.490]  And I guess it's not even so much in the newest one.
[39:37.530 --> 39:39.970]  It's more in, like, Fallout.
[39:40.550 --> 39:41.430]  It's really in Fallout.
[39:42.150 --> 39:46.670]  I can't tell if I'm weirded out because of Tom Cruise.
[39:47.370 --> 39:49.890]  Or if it's just an action movie trope.
[39:49.890 --> 39:56.130]  But they really, like, try to Jesus the Ethan Hunt character in a weird way.
[39:56.470 --> 39:57.750]  That made me uncomfortable.
[39:57.750 --> 40:00.850]  But I couldn't tell if I was uncomfortable because it was Tom Cruise.
[40:00.950 --> 40:03.850]  Like, is that standard action guy procedure?
[40:04.330 --> 40:05.330]  You would say?
[40:05.990 --> 40:09.710]  Because they do this whole thing where his wife is dead but not dead.
[40:10.250 --> 40:11.690]  And then she keeps showing up.
[40:11.890 --> 40:14.170]  But she's in another relationship.
[40:14.390 --> 40:14.750]  So it's not...
[40:14.750 --> 40:16.290]  I guess they're separated at this point.
[40:16.590 --> 40:19.510]  But it's because they do this insane monologue.
[40:19.510 --> 40:21.930]  Ving Rhames has this monologue about...
[40:21.930 --> 40:25.730]  That they couldn't be together because if they were together, then the world would end, essentially.
[40:26.390 --> 40:29.570]  That he needs to be out there stopping the bad guys.
[40:29.790 --> 40:32.370]  Because if he doesn't, then the bad guys would win.
[40:32.930 --> 40:35.430]  Is his wife Michelle Monaghan in those movies?
[40:35.450 --> 40:36.130]  She is, yes.
[40:36.170 --> 40:39.070]  She sells Spectrum Internet now. I see her on fucking every day.
[40:39.070 --> 40:40.390]  Really? I wondered.
[40:41.150 --> 40:43.290]  Because she had a run where she was in a lot of stuff.
[40:43.350 --> 40:45.430]  And she has a prominent role in Mission Impossible 3.
[40:45.870 --> 40:47.790]  And then has cameos in all the other ones.
[40:47.790 --> 40:50.510]  Well, that's why I assume the characters made that decision.
[40:50.630 --> 40:52.830]  Because she was targeted in Mission Impossible 3.
[40:53.290 --> 40:54.630]  Yeah, but they don't frame it that way.
[40:54.870 --> 40:57.250]  They're not like, hey, this happened once and it was bad.
[40:57.830 --> 41:01.270]  Ving Rhames has this monologue about how literally they cannot be together...
[41:01.270 --> 41:06.470]  Because the guilt of them being together would prevent the world from continuing to exist.
[41:06.710 --> 41:08.130]  Because he needs to be on the field.
[41:08.470 --> 41:11.030]  If he's not on the field, then things are going wrong.
[41:11.830 --> 41:13.630]  And it's like, you're part of a fucking agency.
[41:14.310 --> 41:15.190]  There are other agents.
[41:15.190 --> 41:19.850]  What is the rest of the IMF doing outside of disavowing you?
[41:20.510 --> 41:22.710]  Impossible missions. Other impossible missions.
[41:25.390 --> 41:27.170]  That's what I like about Ghost Protocols.
[41:27.210 --> 41:28.410]  They show a different team.
[41:29.110 --> 41:32.610]  It's the only time you ever see anybody else doing anything in the IMF.
[41:32.690 --> 41:38.770]  Also, when do the FBI just promote a mission to the IMF?
[41:38.870 --> 41:40.170]  When are they just like, impossible.
[41:40.830 --> 41:42.450]  Yeah, this is insane.
[41:42.450 --> 41:47.290]  The classification that they only get the impossible missions is ridiculous.
[41:48.170 --> 41:51.650]  I always wondered this about James Bond movies.
[41:51.990 --> 41:56.150]  We're all in love with 007, but that's just because he's the only one we get to hang out with.
[41:56.390 --> 42:00.750]  What if 009 is way cooler and we just don't get to see those stories?
[42:01.170 --> 42:04.230]  I mean, you do get glimpses of other 00s in the movies.
[42:04.490 --> 42:08.330]  Yeah, but in such brief glimpses, you don't get to follow their lives and watch them gamble and shit.
[42:08.910 --> 42:09.530]  That's true.
[42:11.290 --> 42:12.330]  006 was Sean Bean.
[42:12.670 --> 42:16.570]  And I think one of the 00s was a clown that got shot and fell through a window.
[42:16.970 --> 42:19.410]  I want a movie.
[42:19.770 --> 42:23.530]  I want Wilbur Smith 004.
[42:23.750 --> 42:25.750]  And I want two hours of that.
[42:26.890 --> 42:31.070]  There's a scene, I really wish you would have seen the most recent Mission Impossible in theaters, Geoff.
[42:31.530 --> 42:37.030]  There's a scene where there's a character that's introduced that is like a master pickpocket.
[42:37.030 --> 42:46.050]  And their way of illustrating that Ethan Hunt is an equal level pickpocket is he does street magic in front of the frame.
[42:46.370 --> 42:50.810]  Where he's like, oh, this key? And he just flicks it like his hand is empty.
[42:50.950 --> 42:53.070]  And then he has a key there, he does like a little wrist flip.
[42:53.210 --> 42:55.490]  And he's like, this key is a fake one.
[42:55.870 --> 42:57.270]  Unlike the one we have.
[42:57.310 --> 42:59.470]  And then he uses his other hand to show the real key.
[43:00.050 --> 43:01.330]  It is fantastic.
[43:01.850 --> 43:03.910]  Doesn't he do that in Mission Impossible 1 with the knock list?
[43:04.030 --> 43:06.030]  He's like messing with the...
[43:06.450 --> 43:09.930]  Yes, he does like some hand magic in that one as well.
[43:09.990 --> 43:12.270]  But it just, it feels so out of place.
[43:12.330 --> 43:15.370]  The way it's framed, it's just his hands and it's just him doing magic.
[43:16.570 --> 43:21.310]  And it's not, that's not how pickpocketing, like, that's not, that doesn't have anything to do with that.
[43:22.970 --> 43:27.070]  And then he does the raven, which is a specific type of magic trick where he makes it vanish.
[43:27.270 --> 43:28.430]  And I just don't know why.
[43:29.050 --> 43:30.050]  Does he have a raven on?
[43:30.050 --> 43:38.250]  As someone who understands how this trick works, am I supposed to believe that Ethan Hunt has a magnet that he's palmed,
[43:38.570 --> 43:42.650]  that is connected to his jacket on the inside, that retracts?
[43:42.710 --> 43:43.870]  Like, it's insane.
[43:44.210 --> 43:46.470]  Would you say that seems impossible?
[43:47.150 --> 43:48.810]  I would. I would say.
[43:48.950 --> 43:50.250]  It sounds like he's the man for the job.
[43:50.870 --> 43:51.230]  It is.
[43:51.510 --> 43:55.530]  So what would your bookend in Mission Impossible be, the best and the worst, if you had to pick two?
[43:55.670 --> 43:56.910]  Oh, the best is three.
[43:58.370 --> 43:59.170]  The worst?
[44:00.310 --> 44:01.190]  Wow, that's tough.
[44:01.690 --> 44:02.710]  Yeah, two, probably.
[44:03.270 --> 44:03.970]  Two's ridiculous.
[44:04.530 --> 44:05.250]  In, like, a different way.
[44:06.530 --> 44:09.630]  Two is, once again, like, too fast, too furious, essentially, were they?
[44:10.330 --> 44:12.310]  Like, they went dumb in a way that wasn't enjoyable.
[44:13.730 --> 44:15.410]  Um, what about you?
[44:16.070 --> 44:16.950]  I'd probably pick the same.
[44:17.410 --> 44:20.950]  Although I think on a lot of online lists, three doesn't ever get anyone near the top.
[44:21.250 --> 44:22.010]  That's insane.
[44:22.590 --> 44:23.350]  It's so good.
[44:23.350 --> 44:27.550]  Every Mission Impossible movie after three is the same movie to me.
[44:27.610 --> 44:29.930]  Just like, it's all jumbled up in my head.
[44:30.010 --> 44:31.050]  I can't get them straight.
[44:31.290 --> 44:33.510]  I turn one on, it just seems like the other one.
[44:33.630 --> 44:35.670]  They're all, they're fine, but they're all, like, the same.
[44:36.070 --> 44:39.310]  They get really excited about nukes after three.
[44:39.690 --> 44:41.690]  I miss there being, like, a mystery weapon.
[44:42.210 --> 44:44.990]  I really like the idea of, what the fuck is a rabbit's foot?
[44:45.030 --> 44:45.770]  Who's making it?
[44:46.310 --> 44:47.150]  Who called it that?
[44:47.730 --> 44:50.330]  Just every other movie, it's them trying to deal with nukes.
[44:50.630 --> 44:51.770]  And it's not, I don't know.
[44:52.950 --> 44:57.750]  They've, like, hit a point of escalation in a way that it was really, it was great.
[44:57.770 --> 45:00.050]  Because I watched, I caught up on the Mission Impossible movies.
[45:00.450 --> 45:05.110]  And then I watched the one Jason Bourne I hadn't seen, which is the most recent, where Matt Damon comes back.
[45:05.590 --> 45:08.770]  And just, like, that is, we do not need Jason Bourne anymore.
[45:08.970 --> 45:14.530]  Like, Mission Impossible has so overshadowed any value that Jason Bourne had as a character.
[45:14.730 --> 45:16.850]  It's a shame, too, because that first movie is so good.
[45:17.110 --> 45:18.930]  They're really, it's like, it's really cool.
[45:18.930 --> 45:23.430]  I watched, like, the third one on a plane on my way back from Thanksgiving.
[45:23.690 --> 45:29.590]  The stakes are so low for the third movie in a series.
[45:29.750 --> 45:33.030]  You're just kind of like, oh, is this, this is just kind of it.
[45:33.210 --> 45:35.150]  Like, they're not really, it's just him.
[45:35.370 --> 45:36.770]  And not really much else.
[45:36.930 --> 45:37.850]  It's very strange.
[45:38.010 --> 45:39.590]  It's really, really small feeling.
[45:40.070 --> 45:41.830]  Yeah, I guess he's not really saving the world that much.
[45:41.830 --> 45:45.350]  He's just saving himself, I guess.
[45:45.470 --> 45:47.130]  Yeah, it's just really just him.
[45:47.130 --> 45:49.390]  Trying to keep Franco Potente alive or whatever.
[45:49.810 --> 45:50.830]  Yeah, it's just weird.
[45:51.350 --> 45:58.230]  I think it's just the problem with going too far into a series and it's just harder and harder to, you know, eclipse what you've previously done.
[45:58.390 --> 46:01.110]  I feel like that's the, like, 24 suffered from that, right?
[46:01.310 --> 46:09.250]  Like, how many times can you save the president or stop a nuclear bomb from going off in America before it's just like, hey, we saw this three seasons in a row.
[46:09.330 --> 46:09.850]  Who cares?
[46:09.850 --> 46:19.590]  I feel like if I was a supervillain and I was creating a weapon, I would name it something that would be more embarrassing for the FBI and the IMF to say.
[46:21.430 --> 46:24.070]  More embarrassing than impossible mission force?

[47:02.270 --> 47:04.190]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[47:06.970 --> 47:10.570]  If you were going to create an evil weapon, what would it do?
[47:10.730 --> 47:14.830]  Because you'd have to be... the whole point of this, right, is it's the same boring thing over and over again.
[47:14.970 --> 47:18.450]  It's like a bioweapon that wipes out half of humanity.
[47:20.430 --> 47:26.590]  Or it's a nuclear dirty bomb or some sort of EMP that destroys all the technology.
[47:26.910 --> 47:31.590]  What would your supervillain, I guess, attack be?
[47:31.590 --> 47:38.210]  If he likes a DNA altering gas, that means that humans can only survive by eating slugs.
[47:39.170 --> 47:43.310]  And slugs would be the new currency. And people would just be guzzling slugs.
[47:45.810 --> 47:49.770]  That's a good one. That's a really good one.
[47:50.270 --> 47:54.870]  There's lore, slug guzzling, I like it.
[47:55.150 --> 47:59.410]  I like the idea of a spoilable currency. Like money you've got to keep alive.
[48:00.450 --> 48:06.930]  Okay, so if you were really to long play this, you would first have the largest thing of slugs in the world.
[48:07.090 --> 48:10.290]  You'd have all the slugs. You'd have a slug vault.
[48:13.570 --> 48:16.230]  Would there be a thing where they fill it with salt?
[48:17.010 --> 48:18.910]  Oh, like people trying to take out the slug reserves?
[48:19.830 --> 48:21.850]  Is there an anti-slug weapon?
[48:23.590 --> 48:26.570]  Yeah, it's just salt. Yeah, you're right. It's salt. It's just salt.
[48:26.570 --> 48:30.050]  It would just, wherever salt is, that would be...
[48:30.050 --> 48:32.450]  Oh my god, the food bank's been destroyed.
[48:35.350 --> 48:38.550]  Step one, get the world addicted to slugs.
[48:38.950 --> 48:42.150]  Step two, own the salt. And then you've got all the power.
[48:42.870 --> 48:45.250]  The food bank is a great name for a weapon.
[48:45.950 --> 48:48.110]  Deploying the food bank...
[48:50.170 --> 48:55.130]  That's a way better idea. My immediate thought, Gavin, was something that would give everybody in a range vertigo.
[48:55.130 --> 48:58.010]  They'd fall over. Just feel like the world is spinning.
[48:58.270 --> 49:00.730]  Just like a dizzy planet. This is a dizzy planet.
[49:00.870 --> 49:07.030]  I was thinking you could do like an airborne virus that once it enters your body,
[49:07.350 --> 49:11.430]  it gives you crippling arthritis in whichever is your dominant hand.
[49:11.770 --> 49:14.330]  So then you have to use your other hand for everything for the rest of your life.
[49:14.370 --> 49:20.490]  And so we have a whole population of people that suck at writing or shooting guns or opening combo locks.
[49:22.050 --> 49:26.010]  Everyone over the age of 60 can't log into anything because they can't read their post-it notes.
[49:30.160 --> 49:34.520]  It's like a zombie movie for arthritis. Like The Last of Us, but arthritis.
[49:35.340 --> 49:37.360]  That might be the dumbest trope in movies, by the way.
[49:37.980 --> 49:41.220]  Figuring out the password based on shit on the desk.
[49:42.240 --> 49:47.700]  It's never going to be the author of a book or a line in the book.
[49:47.820 --> 49:50.920]  It's just going to be written on a post-it note. Or it's not going to be anywhere nearby.
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.020]  People are always figuring out from books.
[49:54.020 --> 50:02.860]  Yeah, and I don't feel like you see that a lot. I'm trying to think of the last movie I saw where they hacked the computer via like a book or like a note or something.
[50:02.880 --> 50:04.120]  I think it happened in The Watchmen.
[50:05.460 --> 50:07.960]  Does it? The show or the movie?
[50:09.380 --> 50:11.300]  I don't remember. I haven't seen it in a long time.
[50:12.200 --> 50:15.360]  Even that was a while ago. Was that like 2010, 2011?
[50:15.800 --> 50:16.440]  A long time ago.
[50:17.200 --> 50:18.940]  I feel like it happens pretty regularly on TV.
[50:19.540 --> 50:27.060]  It's like the equivalent of finding the keys in the car above the... whatever the thing is called.
[50:28.100 --> 50:33.060]  I want to get a safe that has a sun visor in it just so I can keep stuff under it.
[50:35.940 --> 50:39.860]  That's what you should do is put your passwords above your sun visor.
[50:41.760 --> 50:47.540]  People try to nick the card and pull it down. It's like the password to my bank instead of the key to the car.
[50:47.540 --> 50:50.940]  And then the keys to the car are under your keyboard where the post-it note would be.
[50:56.840 --> 51:00.720]  I didn't share this. Did I have the posters I found for movies on the Xbox store?
[51:00.940 --> 51:02.800]  Did I ever talk about this? This was in my notes.
[51:03.240 --> 51:04.740]  No, I don't think so.
[51:05.020 --> 51:08.040]  Let me pull this up. So I was just looking. They had a deal.
[51:08.460 --> 51:11.680]  They were like, hey, movies are 70% off on the Xbox store.
[51:11.680 --> 51:20.080]  And I was just scrolling through and I don't know when was the last time any of you just like looked at a marketplace like that for buying movies.
[51:20.380 --> 51:24.680]  But some of the box art in them is fucking insane.
[51:25.700 --> 51:31.280]  It is like I don't know where it came from or like who authorized it.
[51:32.380 --> 51:36.780]  The first one I saw here, one second, let me just retrieve this really quick.
[51:36.780 --> 51:40.240]  The first one I saw was for the classic film Mouse Hunt.
[51:41.060 --> 51:42.860]  Everybody loves Mouse Hunt.
[51:44.260 --> 51:46.200]  Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Mouse Hunt.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.400]  Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Mouse Hunt.
[51:49.960 --> 51:52.280]  This is putting it in our chat right now.
[51:52.360 --> 51:54.180]  This is the poster on the Xbox store.
[51:54.220 --> 51:57.280]  If you were to buy Mouse Hunt, this is the official image.
[51:57.800 --> 51:59.680]  This is a studio film.
[52:00.820 --> 52:07.800]  This is tens, if not a hundred million dollars of entertainment.
[52:08.960 --> 52:11.680]  It's just a mouse.
[52:12.320 --> 52:18.260]  It looks like it looks like something Nick made in a pinch because Jeff couldn't make a thumbnail.
[52:21.760 --> 52:29.480]  It looks like whoever made the poster, their dog ate it and they had to make a new one on the way to the meeting.
[52:29.680 --> 52:33.180]  It doesn't have an actor name on it.
[52:33.620 --> 52:43.280]  It just says Mouse Hunt and it is the shittiest looking mouse in a chef outfit eating cheese with an olive.
[52:43.980 --> 52:45.880]  He becomes the cheese tester, doesn't he?
[52:46.360 --> 52:51.720]  If you look at the other Mouse Hunt posters, they keep reusing the same mouse, but it's insane.
[52:52.080 --> 52:54.160]  I've just found my Blu-ray of it.
[52:55.420 --> 52:57.020]  He's on the back.
[52:58.020 --> 52:59.620]  He's on the back of the Blu-ray.
[52:59.840 --> 53:02.540]  Oh, can we see it?
[53:02.900 --> 53:03.860]  Hell yeah!
[53:04.240 --> 53:07.180]  See, he's double fisting olives.
[53:11.440 --> 53:14.480]  What language is that? Is it German?
[53:15.420 --> 53:16.580]  I don't know.
[53:16.580 --> 53:17.020]  Oh, wow.
[53:17.420 --> 53:17.980]  It's got no mouse.
[53:18.500 --> 53:22.680]  M-A-U-S-E-J-A-G-D.
[53:23.060 --> 53:24.120]  Mouse and gods.
[53:25.220 --> 53:30.260]  Eric just posted one where instead of cheese, he's holding a piece of toast that has a bite out of it.
[53:30.500 --> 53:31.420]  Now, here's the thing.
[53:31.580 --> 53:32.260]  Here's the thing.
[53:32.500 --> 53:33.540]  That's what we've seen.
[53:33.700 --> 53:35.100]  Nice mice looking silly.
[53:36.660 --> 53:39.340]  What is going on?
[53:39.800 --> 53:41.300]  What is Mouse Hunt?
[53:41.580 --> 53:43.260]  Has the coolest posters.
[53:48.560 --> 53:51.880]  Un reticito duro de roer?
[53:54.440 --> 54:00.060]  It looks like the mouse is protecting the cheese and he's going to attack these men.
[54:00.480 --> 54:03.380]  And they're hiding behind a bunch of mouse traps.
[54:03.660 --> 54:04.140]  Wow.
[54:04.520 --> 54:06.360]  Can we do a Mouse Hunt watch-along?
[54:07.680 --> 54:09.600]  I don't think I've ever seen it.
[54:10.180 --> 54:10.720]  Oh, God.
[54:11.540 --> 54:15.860]  I was going to say, I think I saw it when it came out, which was 19 what?
[54:16.180 --> 54:17.260]  97, I think it said.
[54:17.540 --> 54:18.020]  Probably.
[54:18.440 --> 54:18.660]  Yeah.
[54:18.800 --> 54:19.520]  I mean, that's a classic.
[54:20.200 --> 54:21.100]  I should watch it.
[54:21.100 --> 54:22.100]  Let's do it.
[54:22.100 --> 54:22.340]  We should.
[54:22.740 --> 54:23.280]  Let's watch it.
[54:23.300 --> 54:23.980]  Yeah, let's do it.
[54:24.200 --> 54:28.320]  We're doing a different watch-along this month, which I'm very excited about.
[54:29.120 --> 54:30.040]  It's the Falcon event.
[54:30.580 --> 54:37.380]  We're doing a live watch-along where I get to pick the film because I won the summer movie battle.
[54:37.860 --> 54:38.700]  Can I make a recommendation?
[54:38.980 --> 54:40.200]  Obviously, you're going to pick the film.
[54:40.300 --> 54:41.140]  Can we make recommendations?
[54:41.660 --> 54:42.140]  You can.
[54:42.180 --> 54:43.520]  I already have it decided, but go ahead.
[54:43.680 --> 54:45.300]  Maybe your recommendation will be my film.
[54:45.840 --> 54:46.320]  Mouse Hunt.
[54:47.680 --> 54:48.040]  No.
[54:48.260 --> 54:48.740]  I'll vote for that.
[54:48.760 --> 54:49.320]  That's a good one.
[54:49.560 --> 54:50.240]  I'll vote, yeah.
[54:50.240 --> 54:51.480]  That's a good one.
[54:51.540 --> 54:54.220]  Honestly, just because the squeak shall inherit the earth.
[54:56.440 --> 54:56.960]  Andrew.
[54:57.600 --> 54:59.380]  That's our thumbnail for the episode.
[54:59.760 --> 55:01.600]  Andrew, I have a question.
[55:02.000 --> 55:02.500]  Yeah, of course.
[55:03.080 --> 55:05.420]  Are you a man or are you a mouse?
[55:05.560 --> 55:06.500]  The hunt is on this Christmas.
[55:07.320 --> 55:10.220]  These are crazy.
[55:10.580 --> 55:13.120]  Why are there so many posters for Mouse Hunt?
[55:13.660 --> 55:15.660]  I don't know, but it is a joy.
[55:16.120 --> 55:17.980]  What is going on?
[55:19.520 --> 55:20.880]  There's a large variety.
[55:21.300 --> 55:21.680]  Oh my God.
[55:21.880 --> 55:26.280]  This is just a revolver pointed at a mouse.
[55:27.120 --> 55:28.240]  That's brutal.
[55:28.560 --> 55:30.120]  That can't be unauthorized.
[55:30.240 --> 55:34.380]  That has to be an independent interpretation of the Mouse Hunt universe.
[55:34.460 --> 55:37.600]  Yeah, that has to be like a Mondo Media or something, right?
[55:37.700 --> 55:38.320]  God damn.
[55:38.980 --> 55:42.380]  I used to love the scene where Christopher Walken is the exterminator.
[55:42.780 --> 55:43.580]  Oh yeah.
[55:43.920 --> 55:45.160]  I don't even remember him in it.
[55:45.480 --> 55:46.220]  That's crazy.
[55:46.220 --> 55:51.580]  He's got all these lenses on his head and he's eating mouse shit and stuff.
[55:51.580 --> 55:52.420]  Oh, that's great.
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.500]  So what movie are you landing on, Andrew?
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.760]  We're going to be watching Snow Day, a childhood Nickelodeon classic.
[56:03.780 --> 56:05.180]  You're going to hate this.
[56:05.560 --> 56:07.980]  I don't think I've seen it.
[56:08.060 --> 56:08.600]  Who's in it?
[56:09.320 --> 56:10.300]  Chevy Chase.
[56:10.780 --> 56:11.260]  Children.
[56:14.500 --> 56:15.580]  Children are in it.
[56:15.580 --> 56:17.420]  I'll watch anything with Chevy Chase. That's fun.
[56:18.400 --> 56:19.280]  I love Chevy Chase.
[56:20.560 --> 56:21.400]  He's a great car.
[56:23.420 --> 56:25.000]  The posters didn't stop there, though.
[56:25.620 --> 56:27.860]  Because let's say you see Mouse Hunt, right?
[56:27.920 --> 56:29.740]  And you're like, man, that's a wacky mouse.
[56:29.820 --> 56:31.820]  I want more wacky animals.
[56:32.460 --> 56:33.460]  I got the bundle for you.
[56:34.180 --> 56:37.840]  The Animal Adventures 10 movie collection.
[56:38.020 --> 56:40.100]  Mouse, once again, just leading the show.
[56:40.260 --> 56:41.040]  Eating cheese.
[56:41.880 --> 56:42.700]  Oh, it's got Rango.
[56:42.700 --> 56:44.360]  It's got Rango.
[56:44.520 --> 56:46.540]  It's got Polly, Barnyard.
[56:47.660 --> 56:49.040]  I'm guessing Hotel for Dogs.
[56:49.340 --> 56:50.600]  Probably Hotel for Dogs, yeah.
[56:51.020 --> 56:52.760]  That's only half the movies, though.
[56:53.900 --> 56:54.480]  Yeah, what's left?
[56:54.640 --> 56:55.280]  I don't know.
[56:55.480 --> 56:56.900]  Well, it says it right here.
[56:57.900 --> 57:00.820]  Adventures with Animal Friends includes Hotel for Dogs,
[57:01.020 --> 57:02.820]  Polly, Rango, Barnyard,
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.580]  Mouse Hunt, Black Beauty,
[57:05.520 --> 57:06.640]  Rhubarb, Zeus,
[57:06.940 --> 57:08.720]  and Roxanne, the Red Pony,
[57:09.220 --> 57:11.000]  and Juan Tan Tan.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.280]  The Dog Who Saved...
[57:13.280 --> 57:14.480]  The Dog Who Saved...
[57:14.480 --> 57:15.180]  Dot, dot, dot.
[57:16.980 --> 57:18.380]  I just hope that's the title.
[57:19.160 --> 57:19.800]  Yeah, me too.
[57:20.900 --> 57:23.080]  Another classic Xbox poster,
[57:23.260 --> 57:24.700]  which, like, once again, never seen
[57:24.700 --> 57:25.900]  them advertised this way.
[57:26.460 --> 57:28.720]  Charlotte's Web. What do you need to know about that?
[57:28.920 --> 57:30.420]  Pig. Pig and a spider.
[57:31.620 --> 57:32.420]  No actor names.
[57:32.620 --> 57:33.240]  Once again.
[57:34.080 --> 57:36.440]  Is it the live action one or the...
[57:36.440 --> 57:38.340]  It's gotta be the live.
[57:38.340 --> 57:39.920]  Yeah, Paramount. Yeah.
[57:40.280 --> 57:42.280]  Live action. And then some of them are just, like,
[57:42.360 --> 57:44.420]  fucked up. Like, the Karate Kid one is just like
[57:44.420 --> 57:46.360]  whoever uploaded the image did
[57:46.360 --> 57:47.000]  a bad job.
[57:47.980 --> 57:50.480]  That looks like somebody took a picture of
[57:50.480 --> 57:52.600]  their DVD on their phone
[57:52.600 --> 57:53.720]  and uploaded it.
[57:53.940 --> 57:55.920]  What the fuck? Yeah, that's bad.
[57:56.580 --> 57:58.300]  It's all, like, milky and washed out.
[57:58.800 --> 58:00.080]  It looks like they Google
[58:00.580 --> 58:02.240]  image searched Karate Kid 2
[58:02.240 --> 58:03.640]  and just took the first image.
[58:04.180 --> 58:06.440]  It did, yeah. And the last one
[58:06.440 --> 58:08.240]  that brought me a lot of joy is, once again,
[58:08.240 --> 58:10.300]  the same thing. Of Short Circuit 2,
[58:11.100 --> 58:12.400]  zero reference of
[58:12.400 --> 58:14.180]  what the movie is on the image.
[58:14.340 --> 58:15.940]  Just a zoomed in
[58:16.740 --> 58:18.320]  robot. I guess
[58:18.320 --> 58:20.320]  we're supposed to get that Johnny's doing
[58:20.320 --> 58:21.880]  a peace sign and that's the two.
[58:22.500 --> 58:24.580]  But they cut his fucking arm off
[58:24.580 --> 58:26.520]  so it's just come floating
[58:26.520 --> 58:28.360]  in so you don't even really know it's
[58:28.360 --> 58:30.520]  his. And there's no
[58:30.520 --> 58:31.980]  other defining info.
[58:32.160 --> 58:33.820]  This one might be the worst one to me.
[58:33.820 --> 58:35.780]  I would love if anyone
[58:35.780 --> 58:37.660]  listening finds some insane
[58:37.660 --> 58:39.860]  movie posters in any digital
[58:39.860 --> 58:41.000]  markets or whatever.
[58:41.760 --> 58:43.020]  Send them away. Please.
[58:43.660 --> 58:45.680]  Put them in our server, our Discord server,
[58:45.780 --> 58:47.880]  or just as a reply with a link.
[58:48.200 --> 58:49.300]  I want to say, I love these.
[58:49.820 --> 58:50.720]  These make me so happy.
[58:51.940 --> 58:53.780]  The premise that, like, somebody spent
[58:53.780 --> 58:56.000]  hundreds of hours making this film
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.860]  and millions of dollars
[58:57.860 --> 58:59.900]  and then they're like, oh, let's
[58:59.900 --> 59:01.960]  you know what? I'm proud of it. Let's see
[59:01.960 --> 59:03.620]  it's on, I bet you it's on the store
[59:03.620 --> 59:05.960]  and then that image from Mouse Hunt shows that
[59:05.960 --> 59:07.980]  like all your work is boiled down
[59:07.980 --> 59:08.780]  to that mouse.
[59:09.460 --> 59:11.980]  It's so funny to me. The one
[59:11.980 --> 59:13.960]  that I think of as just
[59:13.960 --> 59:15.860]  worst movie poster that I hated
[59:15.860 --> 59:17.980]  looking at as a kid, but it should have been
[59:17.980 --> 59:19.880]  a thing for me. Was
[59:19.880 --> 59:21.980]  oh, man, well let me, hang on just a second.
[59:22.160 --> 59:23.700]  It is, Jeff, here's
[59:23.700 --> 59:25.600]  Going Overboard, the Adam Sandler movie.
[59:26.200 --> 59:28.640]  Oh shit. Uhhhhhhh.
[59:29.520 --> 59:34.660]  No. Here's the cover. I know of it. I know of it. I've never seen it.
[59:35.080 --> 59:42.480]  Awful looking. I don't like looking at it. His head. Why? His chest is so long.
[59:42.940 --> 59:51.180]  And then his head is like pre-photoshopped on. Yeah. Everything about it is ugly. I hate it.
[59:51.560 --> 59:56.600]  I hate it. I've never seen this. How's the movie? I don't remember the movie at all.
[59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.500]  It must have been from like the early mid-90s. I just remember it being not for me. I just hated
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:09.500]  the look of that poster. Awful. Yeah. That is, yeah. That's one of the worst ones I've seen.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:15.760]  Just his head on the body. Is the body real? I think it's somebody else's body and they had to
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:22.680]  like make the shoulders and everything like higher up to fit Adam Sandler. It looks really bad.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.880]  Also, these ladies in the background, it looks like they're supposed to be diving into the water,
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.540]  but this boat's clearly going at a pretty good speed because it's got a weight.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:37.040]  So I think that would be dangerous. Also, their knees look pretty locked and they're pushed
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.900]  forward. So if they're not like mid-motion right now, they're going to fucking topple right over.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:47.280]  And there's a giant fucking wall in front of them. Like they're going to clip that on their knees.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.560]  That is damage. Yeah. They're both going to bang their laps on that railing. Yeah, they really are.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.300]  The alternate poster for it is also equally just awful. It's terrible. Oh, there you go. Yeah.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:02.540]  Yeah. These are awful. Yeah. Terrible. They had access to one image of his face and just. Yeah.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.140]  Um, can I show you a current movie poster that I don't understand? And also the title's hilarious.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.500]  I think it's based on a book and stuff. I don't know anything. I don't know anything about it.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:20.860]  Night Bitch is the funniest name for something that you can do or see or read.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:27.100]  Hey, man, what are you up to? I'm going to go see Night Bitch. It's a new Amy Adams movie,
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:32.200]  right? Yeah. Where she's like, it's kind of like a badass at night, uh, supposed to be just like
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.900]  a lady who gets fed up and just starts fucking shit up at night and then has like a normal
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:40.820]  life in the daytime supposedly. It's up for a bunch of awards. And Howard did a whole montage
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:46.420]  of, uh, like good morning, Americas and local news and fucking 6 p.m. not being able to say
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.240]  the name of the fucking movie. And he was just making fun of like, it's 2024 and you can't say
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.900]  the word night bitch. They're like, night rhymes with witch, you know? And it's like,
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:03.360]  who can't hear the word bitch at 8 p.m. on the fucking news? It just seems like a 30 Rock
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:13.820]  joke, doesn't it? It does. It just feels, it feels like, it feels like, oh man, they did a thing on
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:19.420]  30 Rock called MILF Island and then that feels like it became a thing. It did. And then like the
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:25.960]  floodgates are open now and we're in a world where night bitch exists. That's it. I would love to
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:31.480]  play a game where we have to just guess what the plot is based on posters. Because they're so
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:37.680]  useless, modern posters. There's such little info. Like night bitch to me, I would assume that it's
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:44.500]  an Animorphs type story where Amy Adams becomes leader of the dogs and they do a bunch of mischief
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:55.120]  at night. Her and her dog posse. Night bitch. I remember when, I think it was when the second
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.120]  Austin Powers movie was coming out and I was watching someone review it on like daytime TV
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:05.900]  and he was talking about all the characters like, oh, Doctor Who returns and there's a new character
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:12.760]  whose name is too rude to say, but I'll just call him FB and it doesn't stand for Farty Bottom.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.440]  And I just remember being so intrigued about what that guy's name was.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.200]  If it's not Farty Bottom, what could it be?
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.000]  That was such a weird way of not saying the character's name.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:33.260]  Oh man. Farty Bottom. Listen, I was a farty bottom after all that popcorn.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:40.120]  I still don't know why you ate so much popcorn. I couldn't stop, man. It's my food. Do you have
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:46.640]  a food that you just can't end? Like once you start, it's just hot dogs, hot. You are, you're
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.700]  leading the pack on that one. Do you have one, Gavin? Well, no, you're, I mean, you're asking
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.860]  the guy who'd rather be in, you know, nutrient cubes. Oh, I know. That's why I'm so curious if
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:05.840]  there is anything like that for you. I tell you what, one thing that I do have to, I always eat
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:11.780]  too much of and I have to consciously stop myself from eating too much is Cadbury fingers. Oh,
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.840]  I sent you some of those. Yeah. I don't, I don't know what that is. Let me look that up.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:24.020]  They're like little chocolate coated cookies. Yeah. I feel like if I was just on autopilot,
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:29.420]  I would eat half a packet of those. Mmm. Half of it does look good. They are good.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.400]  Let's get some. What were they? Little fingers? No, that's Game of Thrones.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.020]  I wouldn't mind getting Cadbury fingered, I tell you what.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:46.360]  We should start wrapping up. If a Cadbury figure was in your ass,
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.480]  how long would it take to melt the chocolate? Oh man. Not long, baby.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.820]  It's a mission impossible scenario where that's how you stop the bomb. You got to
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:01.440]  melt through the chocolate to get your penis. My asshole is like a microwave. I could heat
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:08.540]  up burritos. Has it always been that way or has it progressed as your butt problems?
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:12.600]  I think it's progressed as my butt problem. I think it's a change. You know, bodies change over
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:19.660]  time. What's the coldest part of your body, would you say? Like if, if your butt is like,
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:25.240]  I don't know, the Florida of your body, it's just always hot. What's the coldest?
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:30.540]  Probably toes or ears. That's where I feel cold the most. Maybe nose, toe, chilly ears.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.340]  Yeah. Interesting.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:37.460]  My nose isn't quite as far away from the warmth of my face as Gavin's is,
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.680]  so I might not have the same issue there, but. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.080]  I wonder where the equator would be on my body.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.200]  Like if I were to divide things. Like if you measured from toe to,
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.020]  to top of the head, where would the halfway mark land?
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.700]  Yeah. Like just as far as, I don't know, temperature or.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.960]  So you got, oh. I guess land is interesting as well.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:04.640]  Cause you got a long back. Oh yeah. Yeah. It would be. Yeah.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.140]  It would look ridiculous. I definitely, I don't think my belly button is in the middle.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.600]  Is it supposed to be? I feel like generally it is.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.700]  That's where, well, I guess hips maybe. Middle of what?
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:22.020]  It's the first time he's ever thought about this. Is the belly button the midway point of the body?
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:26.580]  This just feels like Andrew's never thought about it before you asked him a question and he had to
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:31.260]  go. I was thinking about it. Yeah, generally. Well, then I think about the hips. I think the
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:36.040]  hips I'm thinking of because of magic shows where they cut the person in half and it's always like
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.740]  at the hips. It's not at the belly button. So I guess half a person would be the legs generally.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:46.700]  You'd think it'd be easier to saw somebody in half at the belly button than the hips too.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.640]  You got to go through fucking leg bones at the hips. That's a dense part. Belly buttons,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.320]  you know, you got your spine, but everything else it's like under the ribs, but it's above
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.440]  all that other bullshit. Probably pretty soft spot. Yeah. Why do people always cut off the
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.760]  legs instead of cutting the spine? Yeah. It's like you get one bad, you're like,
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.920]  and then you're through it. But with the legs, you're fucking going all day long.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.200]  And also if you cut the legs off, you've got to make multiple trips. If you've got both legs still
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.180]  attached to each other, you just sling them over your shoulder and you can carry both legs at the
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:22.100]  same time. You know what legs are? The fucking handles of the body. That's what they are. That's
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:28.680]  a great point, Gavin. All right. Well, somebody in half of the legs, like they're, they're on
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.820]  your shoulders. Yeah. I feel like if I was doing it, I would have to like, it would be so that
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.800]  crotch was like sitting on my shoulder. Yeah. Yeah. You'd want their knees over,
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:42.320]  like just bending over, right? Like a backpack almost like you can make a human backpack out of
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.360]  them. Oh yeah. Yeah. And you could like grab the ankles or probably the calves right below the knee
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.900]  would be like the most comfortable and then their knees and the rest of it just hangs off your back
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:58.060]  distributes the weight evenly, I would think. And also any drip would go behind you as you're
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.580]  walking. Andrew, have you scanned your head yet? I haven't cause I've been having a hard time
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:07.300]  finding an app that will do like an accurate scan. All right. I'll send you one. I found one. Okay.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:11.300]  Oh, you did? Awesome. If you send me that, perfect. I want to print your head.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:17.200]  I want you to print my head. Here's hoping that in 2025, we get to print Andrew's head
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.560]  and we get to put puzzles together one more time. Thanks for listening to another episode
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:28.940]  of the Regulation Podcast. We hope you had as much fun as we had. I had a 9.3 amount of fun.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:35.240]  I don't know what that translates into quality, but you'll no doubt let us know. We'll see you
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:42.560]  next week for another banger of a 7 out of a 10. Bye bye. You can split downward too. I didn't
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:48.340]  even think about that. Like a pizza when you go pizza across like down. Oh, what?
