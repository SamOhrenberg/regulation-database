[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  Hey, Fidelity, how can I remember to invest every month?
[00:05.400 --> 00:07.780]  With the Fidelity app, you can choose a schedule
[00:07.780 --> 00:11.440]  and set up recurring investments in stocks and ETFs.
[00:11.860 --> 00:13.620]  Oh, that sounds easier than I thought.
[00:14.100 --> 00:14.880]  You got this.
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.320]  Yeah, I do.
[00:16.720 --> 00:18.420]  Now, where did I put my keys?
[00:19.120 --> 00:21.420]  You will find them where you left them.
[00:23.360 --> 00:25.120]  Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.
[00:25.360 --> 00:28.080]  Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC member NYSE SIPC.
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.400]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[00:33.600 --> 00:34.400]  This is number 56.
[00:34.540 --> 00:38.220]  My name is Jeff. With me, as always, Andrew, Gavin, Nick and Eric.
[00:39.300 --> 00:42.300]  Gavin really knows what he's talking about when it comes to piss
[00:42.300 --> 00:43.980]  and everybody's everybody knows it.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.200]  Really? I was just saying I wish my bladder was a bit bigger.
[00:46.660 --> 00:50.460]  What if there was a reverse puberty at like 85?
[00:51.100 --> 00:52.320]  Like you became unpubic.
[00:52.660 --> 00:54.920]  Like a Benjamin Button situation almost?
[00:55.280 --> 00:57.600]  Yeah, but you don't like shrink down to a child.
[00:57.600 --> 01:00.440]  You're just you're just no longer puberty.
[01:00.700 --> 01:02.020]  Your voice becomes higher.
[01:02.740 --> 01:04.340]  Yeah. You have a higher pitch voice.
[01:04.420 --> 01:05.100]  I like it.
[01:05.860 --> 01:07.700]  I don't see any issue with the reverse puberty.
[01:08.220 --> 01:09.300]  Are there any other changes?
[01:09.400 --> 01:11.160]  You just get a high pitch voice?
[01:11.900 --> 01:12.640]  Less hairy.
[01:13.580 --> 01:15.140]  Well, that happens as you get older, too.
[01:15.280 --> 01:17.640]  Typically, probably a smaller set of genitals.
[01:17.960 --> 01:21.780]  Yeah. Like as you get older, the balls consistently go further, right?
[01:21.840 --> 01:23.260]  Maybe they start coming back up.
[01:23.440 --> 01:24.720]  Maybe they reverse it.
[01:24.720 --> 01:28.460]  Like you hit maximum drop pitch and then they swing up.
[01:28.960 --> 01:31.620]  Like the balls hit the bottom of the yo-yo and then they swing.
[01:31.960 --> 01:33.720]  Yeah, yeah, bounce back.
[01:34.360 --> 01:37.080]  Yeah, they start working at the same speed, but in reverse.
[01:37.160 --> 01:37.920]  When you're like 55.
[01:42.060 --> 01:43.860]  This is a terrible visual.
[01:43.980 --> 01:48.800]  But you know how like your kids will measure on like a doorframe as they get bigger.
[01:48.820 --> 01:50.180]  It's like a reverse ball thing.
[01:50.240 --> 01:51.860]  The ball length going up, going down.
[01:52.380 --> 01:53.500]  So happy you said doorframe.
[01:53.500 --> 01:55.980]  Oh, well, how else do they measure?
[01:56.640 --> 01:58.180]  I don't know. Nothing. Wall?
[01:59.400 --> 02:01.800]  Do you have your childhood walls so you can look at your height on?
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.860]  No. No, me neither.
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.520]  My childhood walls are about to get turned into a mall.
[02:07.920 --> 02:08.600]  Childhood walls.
[02:09.420 --> 02:10.840]  What store do you think it's going to be?
[02:11.220 --> 02:14.020]  Oh, man, I didn't even think about that.
[02:14.300 --> 02:15.580]  That's the first thing I thought of.
[02:15.620 --> 02:18.560]  You didn't even think about like Canadian Foot Locker is going to be like
[02:18.560 --> 02:19.340]  where your bedroom was.
[02:19.440 --> 02:21.380]  Do you think you'd be able to pinpoint it?
[02:21.700 --> 02:22.720]  Oh, definitely I could.
[02:22.720 --> 02:24.420]  Yeah, without a doubt.
[02:24.900 --> 02:26.500]  Is it perfectly in line with the other four?
[02:27.140 --> 02:29.680]  Uh. Oh, man.
[02:30.200 --> 02:31.520]  Yeah. Is this mall in the line?
[02:32.120 --> 02:34.100]  No. Yeah, yeah, it would be.
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.080]  It would be. It's an extension of an already existing fake mall.
[02:37.460 --> 02:39.980]  We have so many fake malls and it's a fake mall.
[02:40.620 --> 02:41.220]  What does that mean?
[02:41.260 --> 02:42.700]  Does that mean?
[02:43.020 --> 02:47.580]  So it's not like they call it a mall, but it's all like exterior stores
[02:47.580 --> 02:51.100]  or like they're in a line, but none of them connect.
[02:51.820 --> 02:53.780]  Mm. I see what you're saying.
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.020]  It's like an outdoor mall.
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.980]  Yeah. Like, you know, like a strip mall.
[02:57.240 --> 02:58.120]  Sort of. Yeah.
[02:58.140 --> 02:59.680]  But like larger. Yeah.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.160]  Like South Park Meadows.
[03:01.820 --> 03:03.840]  It's odd. Oh, got it.
[03:04.100 --> 03:04.720]  It's a weird thing.
[03:04.720 --> 03:09.700]  So my my childhood home is on a street that the mall has slowly been taking over
[03:09.700 --> 03:12.680]  for many years as an extension.
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.580]  And people have held on in protest because they just want to destroy the street
[03:17.580 --> 03:20.180]  and then extend it to be part of the mall.
[03:20.180 --> 03:23.280]  But there's only one house left and that house
[03:24.420 --> 03:25.760]  is holding on for now.
[03:25.860 --> 03:28.440]  But I think it may it may be selling soon.
[03:28.920 --> 03:32.860]  So ideally, if you could choose,
[03:33.080 --> 03:36.240]  what store would be like?
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.600]  I think there would be a beautiful irony if there was a Lids
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.780]  over my childhood home.
[03:43.620 --> 03:46.660]  Just a store of merchandise I could never use.
[03:47.940 --> 03:49.460]  That would be so funny.
[03:49.460 --> 03:54.180]  I feel like you deserve to have your old home turned into like a bathtub store.
[03:54.580 --> 03:58.300]  Oh, OK. So like a Lush type thing or like a bath bomb?
[03:59.680 --> 04:00.960]  Oh, you went with the bath bomb.
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.640]  I'd be wild if Lush actually sold a bathtub.
[04:04.300 --> 04:06.340]  Dude, a Lush bathtub that slowly disintegrates.
[04:06.660 --> 04:08.280]  Yeah, it just slowly melts.
[04:09.280 --> 04:10.800]  Oh, we should make a bath bomb tub.
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.100]  Is Lush the ultimate Mother's Day company?
[04:15.780 --> 04:17.480]  You're like, oh, fuck, I got to get it from my mom.
[04:17.880 --> 04:18.760]  Bath bomb, perfect.
[04:20.780 --> 04:24.180]  I appreciate that they decided to associate bomb with a pleasure.
[04:24.700 --> 04:25.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:26.340 --> 04:27.640]  And what are the good bombs out there?
[04:28.080 --> 04:31.440]  Spice bomb. When we go to go eat, dip, dip, dip.
[04:31.540 --> 04:33.260]  Money bomb. Is that a thing?
[04:33.960 --> 04:35.360]  I think it's a Brad Pitt movie.
[04:35.540 --> 04:37.860]  Yeah, you were going to you were going to hit me with a money bomb.
[04:38.460 --> 04:41.720]  This weekend, you said you were going to shower me with explosive money.
[04:42.180 --> 04:45.780]  And I was like, OK, Gavin, you said you had a realization this morning.
[04:45.780 --> 04:47.480]  And I want to I want to know what that was.
[04:47.540 --> 04:49.060]  I've been thinking about it for hours.
[04:49.340 --> 04:51.380]  I discovered the source of my strikes.
[04:52.640 --> 04:54.100]  You have a source of strikes.
[04:54.140 --> 04:56.780]  That's also not what I was assuming your realization was.
[04:57.360 --> 04:59.960]  Yeah. Nick sends me the link, right? Right.
[05:00.700 --> 05:02.940]  Opens the browser, that Google Drive folder.
[05:03.260 --> 05:06.400]  I then go to my audio folder, drag it.
[05:06.760 --> 05:09.740]  I let go and it does nothing the first time.
[05:10.120 --> 05:12.220]  And then if I do it again, it starts uploading.
[05:13.060 --> 05:14.240]  So it's a click and drag.
[05:14.820 --> 05:16.200]  Classic click and drag problem.
[05:16.500 --> 05:17.400]  Do you want to the drag?
[05:17.740 --> 05:19.200]  I do the drag. Absolutely.
[05:19.400 --> 05:20.920]  I'm a big clicker and a big dragger.
[05:21.140 --> 05:23.180]  That's good. Do a lot of drag in myself.
[05:23.460 --> 05:24.740]  Yeah, me too. I click and drag in there.
[05:24.860 --> 05:27.620]  So now that you know that that's the issue since your revelation,
[05:27.760 --> 05:28.960]  it shouldn't be happening anymore, right?
[05:29.440 --> 05:33.200]  In theory. And the audience will be pleased to know I picked up
[05:33.200 --> 05:35.660]  picked me up a couple of strikes at the weekend.
[05:36.120 --> 05:36.940]  Sure did. Yeah.
[05:37.540 --> 05:40.000]  We started a Slack channel for Gavin Strikes.
[05:40.180 --> 05:41.580]  There's no way I'd remember otherwise.
[05:42.060 --> 05:43.300]  It's like I need a place to put these.
[05:43.760 --> 05:46.940]  I'm pretty damn close to overtaking my hot dog count with strikes.
[05:47.600 --> 05:48.580]  That five strikes.
[05:48.940 --> 05:50.420]  How many did you pick up this weekend?
[05:50.880 --> 05:52.680]  Two. I got a double whammy.
[05:52.760 --> 05:55.420]  I got two. Oh, it was an audio and a video.
[05:55.820 --> 05:58.640]  It's so funny that this is about strikes because I thought it was going to be
[05:58.640 --> 06:01.520]  about like you realizing a communication thing
[06:01.520 --> 06:06.920]  because you annoyed Jeff accidentally and extremely.
[06:07.720 --> 06:08.400]  Oh, I was getting.
[06:09.560 --> 06:10.980]  What you talk about this morning?
[06:11.820 --> 06:14.160]  Yes, I because it was part of that video.
[06:14.300 --> 06:14.900]  You're like, you know what?
[06:14.920 --> 06:17.540]  I had a realization about this, so I thought it was about
[06:17.540 --> 06:21.660]  is going to be some deeper insight about the miscommunication.
[06:21.720 --> 06:22.800]  Let me be honest with you.
[06:23.080 --> 06:24.020]  I was sat there.
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.260]  Everyone's calling me pedantic and saying I'm a bastard.
[06:26.540 --> 06:28.220]  I still have no idea what happened.
[06:28.680 --> 06:32.080]  Why don't you go back to the realization drawing board and try for a little longer?
[06:33.020 --> 06:33.740]  You'll get there.
[06:35.680 --> 06:37.100]  Well, now we've got to explain it.
[06:37.520 --> 06:38.540]  No, I can explain.
[06:38.700 --> 06:40.200]  No, we don't. We don't have to explain it.
[06:40.200 --> 06:42.360]  I think it's funnier this way.
[06:42.680 --> 06:46.060]  No, it isn't, because I still don't really know what you're annoyed at.
[06:48.200 --> 06:51.320]  The problem with you, Gavin, is that you have a steward
[06:51.320 --> 06:54.720]  and like a whatever in you, you know, or like you're
[06:54.720 --> 06:56.900]  you have a little mischief maker in you.
[06:57.080 --> 07:00.280]  And there are times when you're not meaning to create mischief,
[07:00.360 --> 07:03.220]  but it feels so obvious that like there's no other option
[07:03.760 --> 07:06.160]  and you're just genuinely asking a question.
[07:06.540 --> 07:09.580]  I was trying to help and I was confused and I need like
[07:09.580 --> 07:13.540]  some sort of signal, like a noise or a sound effect that is like a non-rabbit.
[07:13.940 --> 07:14.980]  Yes, you need.
[07:15.580 --> 07:17.140]  Identifier, like a preface to a sentence.
[07:17.140 --> 07:20.800]  You need like the reverse of a dog whistle, like it's to indicate a genuine.
[07:21.040 --> 07:24.200]  It's not. It's like a human, a human whistle, like a truth whistle.
[07:24.900 --> 07:25.540]  A truth tone.
[07:26.020 --> 07:27.460]  So here's what happened. Here's what happened, right?
[07:27.940 --> 07:30.040]  We're playing, we're playing Doom. Jeff's playing.
[07:30.260 --> 07:31.900]  Jeff's got the game. We're all watching.
[07:32.120 --> 07:34.020]  Jeff says, can someone record the backup?
[07:34.480 --> 07:36.100]  I go to. That's not what Jeff said.
[07:36.660 --> 07:39.040]  OK, you said your shit, your shit might be broken.
[07:39.040 --> 07:40.600]  I'm a little worried.
[07:40.720 --> 07:42.800]  I'm a little worried about my video capture.
[07:43.020 --> 07:45.480]  Could somebody record a backup video for me?
[07:45.560 --> 07:50.120]  So immediately I got OBS open and then I realized, oh,
[07:50.200 --> 07:52.740]  I record the backup quite a lot, especially for streams,
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.460]  which is usually like a same screen sort of situation.
[07:55.640 --> 07:58.300]  I immediately realized I'm not in the game with Jeff.
[07:58.420 --> 08:00.100]  There's no my perspective to record.
[08:00.360 --> 08:02.300]  So then I asked, I was just like, oh.
[08:03.440 --> 08:05.820]  Do you mean like record the the Discord?
[08:06.020 --> 08:07.280]  Because we're watching a stream on Discord.
[08:07.280 --> 08:10.940]  And you said no, like I was an idiot.
[08:11.140 --> 08:13.680]  And then I was just sat back thinking, I don't know.
[08:13.820 --> 08:14.900]  What does he mean then? What am I?
[08:15.520 --> 08:16.580]  And I'm just trying to help.
[08:16.660 --> 08:18.100]  I'm just trying to help you record the backup.
[08:18.400 --> 08:19.180]  I don't know what you mean.
[08:19.420 --> 08:20.900]  And then I asked again.
[08:21.420 --> 08:22.460]  And you said yes.
[08:22.740 --> 08:23.700]  So I was very confused.
[08:23.800 --> 08:24.660]  I thought, what do you want from me?
[08:24.820 --> 08:26.760]  And then I'm being told I'm pedantic.
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.160]  If I'd sat there wedging both thumbs into my anus doing nothing,
[08:31.240 --> 08:34.880]  I would've got in less trouble than if I was sat up trying to figure out what you meant.
[08:35.720 --> 08:39.220]  You asked us, I know it was rhetorical, but you asked a second ago,
[08:39.360 --> 08:42.860]  what do you want from me? Yeah, I want this is what I wanted.
[08:43.780 --> 08:46.480]  Oh, oh, wait. So you're just messing with me the whole time?
[08:46.840 --> 08:48.960]  No. Hey, welcome to the podcast. OK.
[08:50.440 --> 08:51.780]  Welcome to the regulation podcast.
[08:52.040 --> 08:58.800]  Maybe you look around, you know, rummage through the drawers, reads, learn all.
[08:58.920 --> 09:00.780]  It's you're going to have a lot of fun here. It's great.
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.300]  It's just it's sometimes you have a beautiful thing, Gavin, where.
[09:04.300 --> 09:07.100]  Yeah. You're actually trying so hard to be helpful
[09:07.100 --> 09:09.660]  that it feels like you're fucking with us. It does.
[09:09.780 --> 09:10.700]  Well, and that's what it was.
[09:10.780 --> 09:13.840]  That was weird about it, because I was I was really trying to like fight through
[09:13.840 --> 09:15.600]  getting yelled at to still try and help.
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.000]  Yeah. You're trying to be good.
[09:17.100 --> 09:20.280]  And then you poured on and then Jeff was like, thank you, Andrew.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.900]  And I was like, what? And then Eric was shit.
[09:21.960 --> 09:24.740]  I mean, then even Nick said I was being a pedantic bastard.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.480]  And I just thought, I don't know what's happening.
[09:28.740 --> 09:30.160]  Everyone was messing with me then.
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.480]  Yeah. Yeah. I was having fun.
[09:33.480 --> 09:34.700]  I was having fun with my friends.
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.440]  I was having fun with my friends.
[09:37.420 --> 09:39.040]  Yeah. I don't even know where to go with it.
[09:41.080 --> 09:42.820]  You just you just keep being you.
[09:42.940 --> 09:43.300]  It's awesome.
[09:45.120 --> 09:46.400]  It is awesome.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.200]  No, it wasn't.
[09:49.880 --> 09:50.740]  Help me out here.
[09:51.360 --> 09:52.040]  Help you out.
[09:53.200 --> 09:54.120]  You want some help?
[09:54.580 --> 09:55.420]  What when you shower?
[09:56.660 --> 09:59.180]  Oh, when you have a shower, do you face the shower?
[09:59.260 --> 10:00.080]  Do you face the wall?
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.540]  I face the shower to wash my face and my hair.
[10:06.020 --> 10:08.020]  And then I turn around for the rest of the shower.
[10:08.520 --> 10:11.660]  OK. I don't like I don't like water on my face that much.
[10:11.700 --> 10:12.540]  So I get it out of the way.
[10:14.200 --> 10:15.380]  Yeah. Oh, do you see me?
[10:15.480 --> 10:18.520]  Sorry. Yeah, I got really hot while I was yelling.
[10:18.680 --> 10:19.100]  And now I'm just.
[10:21.240 --> 10:26.000]  No, I would say 90% of the shower is hitting me in the back.
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.860]  And I'm turning around for, you know, select moments.
[10:29.580 --> 10:30.400]  Interesting when it.
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.100]  But mainly it's going down my back and my crack, and then I'm like spinning a few times.
[10:35.320 --> 10:41.140]  I was talking to someone and I had never considered having the shower
[10:41.140 --> 10:45.140]  be predominantly on my back or to wash my hair with my back facing it,
[10:45.140 --> 10:46.220]  as opposed to the front.
[10:46.480 --> 10:49.380]  And they had equally never considered just facing it
[10:49.380 --> 10:52.460]  and having like tilting your head down for it.
[10:52.500 --> 10:54.880]  So it's curious as I was interested to see
[10:55.400 --> 10:57.940]  if there was like most people do it one way or the other.
[10:58.460 --> 10:59.540]  Seems pretty split.
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.940]  Wait, so you face it? The whole time.
[11:02.560 --> 11:06.880]  I feel like when I'm facing the shower, I'm borderline waterboarding myself.
[11:07.080 --> 11:10.340]  Yeah. I do like head down.
[11:10.820 --> 11:11.880]  Hits the top of the head.
[11:12.500 --> 11:13.660]  Maybe it's a head size thing.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.420]  So it's all like flowing around your face.
[11:16.620 --> 11:19.520]  See, I feel I feel like I'm really working the hands.
[11:19.700 --> 11:21.580]  The hands are working the front real well.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.660]  Like I'm getting suds.
[11:22.780 --> 11:24.300]  They go, it's I'm blasting the front.
[11:24.680 --> 11:27.260]  And if the water is mainly dealing with the back
[11:27.260 --> 11:30.340]  because I'm not scrubbing, you know, the middle of my spine very well.
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.880]  No, I feel like it evens out.
[11:32.260 --> 11:34.020]  Yeah. Like I'll do some spins and stuff.
[11:34.080 --> 11:38.320]  I'll make sure to get all the angles, but I'm predominantly facing that shower.
[11:38.820 --> 11:40.340]  You'll do some spins?
[11:40.800 --> 11:44.740]  Yeah. You got to get full body coverage and tilt around, spin,
[11:45.860 --> 11:48.520]  move around, you know, you had a shower.
[11:48.940 --> 11:50.460]  So it described it kind of like a ballerina.
[11:50.560 --> 11:51.920]  I thought that you had to do some spins.
[11:52.280 --> 11:54.300]  Eric, we we don't know how you shower.
[11:54.620 --> 11:55.220]  Oh, I'm like Gavin.
[11:55.380 --> 11:59.540]  I face away most of the time and then to wash like face
[12:00.580 --> 12:01.300]  face in the front.
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.080]  Yeah, like but most of the time it just too much,
[12:04.080 --> 12:07.080]  too much at play when you're facing the shower.
[12:07.680 --> 12:11.240]  You do like your dick and under like your pits and your face and then
[12:11.620 --> 12:12.760]  everything else is from the back.
[12:13.020 --> 12:14.140]  Yeah. You know what?
[12:14.160 --> 12:16.620]  We should try doing opposite shower next shower.
[12:17.220 --> 12:19.460]  Oh, I know you're going to say we should all try taking a shower together.
[12:19.540 --> 12:20.860]  But yeah, I like your I like that idea.
[12:20.860 --> 12:22.860]  Oh, give me two.
[12:23.420 --> 12:24.280]  Yeah, me too.
[12:25.360 --> 12:27.000]  But you don't hit the shower that much, right?
[12:27.040 --> 12:28.600]  You're mainly tub guy still.
[12:28.720 --> 12:29.220]  Oh, no, no.
[12:29.320 --> 12:31.960]  Like if I'm the tub is a pleasure option.
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.280]  It's not if I'm getting clean, I'm going to use it to shower.
[12:34.980 --> 12:36.460]  I'll keep the shower in the rotation.
[12:37.740 --> 12:41.600]  So let's say how many days a week would you say
[12:41.600 --> 12:44.280]  you bathe versus shower?
[12:44.860 --> 12:45.760]  Like what's the ratio?
[12:46.580 --> 12:49.800]  I'd say probably ideal rotation.
[12:49.800 --> 12:52.100]  You're you're doing like shower every like two days
[12:52.580 --> 12:54.400]  and then like a bath in between.
[12:54.900 --> 12:56.720]  OK. I mean, that's a lot.
[12:56.960 --> 12:57.900]  Feels like a lot of water.
[12:58.060 --> 13:01.980]  But if we're in an ideal rotation, maximum for me, comfort
[13:01.980 --> 13:05.720]  mix of cleanliness and comfort, you're going like
[13:06.220 --> 13:10.300]  probably once every two days at most three and then bath in between.
[13:11.220 --> 13:13.060]  Nick, how what was the last time you took a bath?
[13:15.860 --> 13:17.280]  Last night to cool down.
[13:17.280 --> 13:19.720]  Really? Is that true?
[13:20.260 --> 13:22.660]  Yeah, I felt really bad last night.
[13:23.060 --> 13:24.640]  Wait, after the dogs?
[13:25.380 --> 13:26.560]  Yeah. Full squint.
[13:26.680 --> 13:27.320]  Get into the tub.
[13:27.760 --> 13:31.320]  But then you came back from I wasn't even going to get into this.
[13:31.400 --> 13:32.420]  This is a totally different thing.
[13:32.500 --> 13:36.760]  But you came back when we were we broke for lunch and then came back.
[13:36.880 --> 13:40.220]  And then you asked Gavin if he's like doing OK because you're not.
[13:40.380 --> 13:44.520]  I haven't I hadn't eaten anything yet today when we recorded until like what?
[13:44.560 --> 13:45.700]  Two or so. Yeah.
[13:46.360 --> 13:46.960]  Two thirty.
[13:47.240 --> 13:49.880]  And I was like, I'll just eat a little something because I'm hungry,
[13:50.060 --> 13:51.700]  but I'm just kind of feeling.
[13:52.560 --> 13:55.240]  And so I just had some oatmeal with like a little bit of peanut butter
[13:55.240 --> 13:57.920]  and it just natural peanut butter with no salt or sugar.
[13:58.580 --> 13:59.700]  And I ate it.
[13:59.780 --> 14:02.820]  And then I was just sitting there like, oh, what?
[14:03.940 --> 14:05.340]  And I'm really hot.
[14:05.460 --> 14:06.780]  I'm really hot right now.
[14:07.960 --> 14:09.260]  Yeah, I'm hot.
[14:09.760 --> 14:11.580]  You were like Godzilla roaring.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.980]  Yeah, dude. Last night I was Godzilla roaring.
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.600]  I woke up at like one thirty in the morning.
[14:16.020 --> 14:18.720]  And I was like, I just want to die.
[14:21.660 --> 14:23.840]  And the noises equate to what?
[14:23.940 --> 14:24.780]  Stomach pain?
[14:25.300 --> 14:26.360]  Yeah, stomach pain.
[14:26.540 --> 14:29.780]  A lot of stomach pain, but also like just general hotness.
[14:29.880 --> 14:32.520]  I thought I might be having a heat stroke, even though I was in my air conditioned
[14:32.520 --> 14:32.780]  house.
[14:33.820 --> 14:36.080]  You just have a legit elevated temperature.
[14:36.560 --> 14:39.460]  I guess so. I had Pedialyte and stuff and I cooled down.
[14:39.680 --> 14:42.900]  And I like kind of wandered back and forth between the the
[14:43.500 --> 14:46.800]  bathroom in my room and then like the main bathroom.
[14:46.940 --> 14:48.400]  I was just like, it's cooler in this one.
[14:48.480 --> 14:49.960]  Now it's cooler in that one. It's cooler in this one.
[14:50.640 --> 14:53.000]  Just trying to figure out if I had to go to the bathroom or not.
[14:53.060 --> 14:53.440]  And I couldn't.
[14:53.540 --> 14:56.760]  It's like when you burn your finger and you can't get it to feel cold and you keep
[14:56.760 --> 14:57.940]  having to go to the cold tap.
[14:58.380 --> 15:00.580]  But also I had like heartburn at the same time.
[15:00.620 --> 15:01.900]  So it was like all right here.
[15:02.060 --> 15:06.040]  I feel like the poison shook off me last night, but I felt
[15:06.040 --> 15:09.020]  I felt like Godzilla roar and I felt pukey.
[15:09.900 --> 15:13.760]  And I was debating whether I was going to have a papless sleep because I felt so pukey.
[15:13.860 --> 15:15.480]  But eventually it did go.
[15:15.640 --> 15:18.160]  But I do feel like just uncomfortable and shitty and hot today.
[15:18.820 --> 15:20.620]  Puking in the pap would be so bad.
[15:21.180 --> 15:25.580]  I don't think I over sodium to myself or something because I just felt so salty.
[15:25.960 --> 15:28.660]  And I sat on the I have I have a couch that's leather.
[15:28.800 --> 15:30.280]  So I was like, oh, it's cool. It's cool on my back.
[15:30.380 --> 15:32.000]  And then I heard Archie stir.
[15:32.160 --> 15:34.900]  He started crying in the night and he was having a bad dream.
[15:34.920 --> 15:37.720]  I was like, oh, fuck, I'm going to die and I'm going to die in his room.
[15:37.720 --> 15:43.380]  Like, you know, I went and I laid down on the floor next to him and I was like, oh, it's OK, bud.
[15:43.440 --> 15:44.120]  Don't worry about it.
[15:44.220 --> 15:46.580]  Laid right down on a bunch of fucking Hot Wheels cars.
[15:46.840 --> 15:47.880]  Had a great night.
[15:48.100 --> 15:49.340]  What the hell?
[15:49.600 --> 15:51.140]  Like shit. Hot as fuck.
[15:51.920 --> 15:53.420]  Tummy hurts. Sick.
[15:54.100 --> 15:56.380]  Wow. How are you? How are you doing today, Eric?
[15:56.540 --> 15:58.360]  I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
[15:58.360 --> 15:59.620]  I feel great, too.
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.060]  Like I had like a couple of beers with like the dogs or whatever.
[16:03.220 --> 16:06.580]  So it was like I woke up feeling like a little like like in my mouth.
[16:06.580 --> 16:08.820]  But everything I'm I'm fine.
[16:08.920 --> 16:11.440]  You brush your teeth and you're good. I'm fine, man.
[16:11.480 --> 16:14.480]  I feel like we really must have played some kind of hot dog Russian roulette
[16:14.480 --> 16:16.880]  because I walked away a OK.
[16:17.260 --> 16:20.280]  And you got off when you said beers with the dogs.
[16:20.380 --> 16:22.760]  I imagine you and a pack of dogs is drinking away.
[16:23.960 --> 16:26.980]  My association was not immediate hot dogs and beers.
[16:27.460 --> 16:29.960]  What kind of dog is the best dog to drink beer with?
[16:30.360 --> 16:33.800]  Oh, I feel like a bulldog is such a great drinking dog.
[16:33.800 --> 16:35.660]  But maybe I'm influenced by barks.
[16:36.620 --> 16:38.600]  I feel like St. Bernard's.
[16:38.820 --> 16:40.860]  But I guess you drink whiskey with them, maybe.
[16:41.360 --> 16:42.820]  But they seem like a good beer drinking dog, too.
[16:43.060 --> 16:44.800]  What kind of dog was a lassie dog?
[16:46.160 --> 16:47.120]  A Border Collie.
[16:48.420 --> 16:49.940]  Yeah, I'd bev it up with one then.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.560]  I think it's a Chihuahua.
[16:54.060 --> 16:59.800]  One of those like like the ones where you go to your friend's house
[16:59.800 --> 17:03.960]  and it's like their mom's dog and it's just sort of like
[17:04.840 --> 17:07.900]  not super like great looking, but it looks good enough.
[17:08.200 --> 17:10.900]  And it's you're just like this dog's old and kind of like fucked up.
[17:11.080 --> 17:11.820]  And that's pretty cool.
[17:12.360 --> 17:13.900]  Chihuahua's going to get you into a bar fight.
[17:14.880 --> 17:15.160]  What?
[17:15.280 --> 17:16.200]  You're going to drink too much
[17:16.200 --> 17:18.120]  and then you're going to instigate with somebody in the bar
[17:18.120 --> 17:19.220]  and you're going to end up in a fight.
[17:20.100 --> 17:23.180]  Chihuahua is the kind of dog that lets its mouth write a check
[17:23.180 --> 17:25.000]  that its owner can't cash.
[17:25.300 --> 17:26.440]  This is my kind of drinking dog.
[17:28.120 --> 17:30.120]  That dog can't hold its booze.
[17:30.380 --> 17:33.320]  Senior Chihuahua, I think, is my kind of drinking dog.
[17:33.960 --> 17:36.580]  Oh, yeah, a little rat claws.
[17:37.300 --> 17:42.360]  When you would have pain, did you ever visualize it internally as like a specific thing?
[17:43.220 --> 17:44.580]  Like Nick's talking about going Godzilla.
[17:46.740 --> 17:48.180]  Godzilla mode inside.
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.640]  When I was a kid and I would have pain, like internal pain in my head,
[17:54.740 --> 17:58.900]  I would always visualize that that area, there was like a door
[17:58.900 --> 18:02.280]  that that like guards were trying to break into.
[18:03.360 --> 18:06.920]  So like my stomach hurt, I had like a stomach door
[18:06.920 --> 18:09.700]  and the bad guys were trying to break through the stomach door.
[18:09.760 --> 18:10.800]  And that's what the pain was.
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.520]  Oh, interesting.
[18:13.140 --> 18:14.720]  I used to visualize it.
[18:15.280 --> 18:17.380]  I used to visualize like a heart.
[18:18.220 --> 18:22.260]  In each, like if I had an earache, it was like someone was squeezing my tiny ear.
[18:22.260 --> 18:25.200]  Heart. Oh, your little ear heart.
[18:25.660 --> 18:28.540]  Yeah, it's like gripping it and ripping it.
[18:29.540 --> 18:32.260]  So would you see a little ear heart in your mind?
[18:32.660 --> 18:35.720]  No, I would just visualize it being squeezed when my ear hurt.
[18:35.740 --> 18:37.600]  I used to get like ear infections as a kid.
[18:38.160 --> 18:40.020]  Andrew, is that picture kind of like what you picture?
[18:41.600 --> 18:44.460]  Uh, a little bit less cartoony.
[18:45.780 --> 18:50.140]  OK, but yeah, more realistic, like more like realistic is what you're thinking.
[18:50.140 --> 18:52.560]  In my head, it was always like a medieval door for some reason.
[18:53.540 --> 18:55.100]  Oh, it was like an old castle.
[18:56.080 --> 18:58.000]  Hold the door. Hold the door.
[18:58.140 --> 19:00.860]  I'm trying to, I was trying to find the image right now.
[19:02.280 --> 19:05.360]  Nick said that he has link health hearts in mind.
[19:07.040 --> 19:11.280]  I recently haven't watched Game of Thrones in such a long time,
[19:11.280 --> 19:15.380]  and I recently watched a clip of it, and it occurred to me
[19:15.380 --> 19:18.420]  that I didn't have this thought at all while watching it,
[19:18.700 --> 19:22.500]  that White Walkers just look like they were all AI generated,
[19:23.260 --> 19:27.440]  like they have a style to them that like all of it looks like shit
[19:27.440 --> 19:28.760]  now in a way that it didn't.
[19:28.840 --> 19:31.840]  Like every time I see, I'll post a photo as an example.
[19:32.280 --> 19:33.560]  This just looks like AI.
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.440]  This looks like an AI made thing.
[19:35.580 --> 19:38.000]  Oh yeah, I thought it looked like shit back then.
[19:38.140 --> 19:39.240]  Like it looked terrible.
[19:39.820 --> 19:43.860]  Maybe AI is just a real big fan of Game of Thrones and it lifted its style.
[19:44.160 --> 19:46.960]  It could be. They've sourced it all from Game of Thrones.
[19:47.240 --> 19:48.500]  Like this looks bad.
[19:48.800 --> 19:52.340]  I don't know another way to put it, like Game of Thrones in like that last season
[19:52.340 --> 19:55.780]  or like the last two where it was doing that stuff was like, this looks terrible.
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.880]  While watching it, I didn't notice it.
[19:58.020 --> 20:00.320]  But now when I see it, it's just they look like the same.
[20:00.320 --> 20:02.480]  It looks very AI to me.
[20:02.860 --> 20:02.960]  Yeah.
[20:03.060 --> 20:08.360]  What a terrifying seven year enemy that turned out to be no big fucking deal.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.740]  Yeah, it's a very wet dick of an ending for that character.
[20:12.080 --> 20:12.800]  God damn.
[20:13.420 --> 20:17.420]  I think now looking back, hold the door is the best moment of the entire show.
[20:17.940 --> 20:18.540]  Oh, interesting.
[20:19.120 --> 20:19.420]  Yeah.
[20:20.040 --> 20:21.600]  It's just quite a quite a payoff.
[20:21.980 --> 20:22.640]  It is.
[20:23.100 --> 20:25.720]  But I guess it's like a mystery that I never cared about.
[20:25.780 --> 20:26.880]  But it is a good payoff.
[20:27.260 --> 20:28.400]  Yeah, I think that's why I liked it though.
[20:28.420 --> 20:29.680]  It caught me off guard and I was like, oh,
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.400]  if you think about the logistics of that, he like time sniped that guy.
[20:34.140 --> 20:35.160]  Yeah, so sad.
[20:36.660 --> 20:37.820]  Yeah, he did.
[20:38.660 --> 20:40.040]  He did, so sad.
[20:40.400 --> 20:41.880]  Yeah, it's all it's tragic.
[20:42.180 --> 20:45.420]  I like that we're playing future baseball and people can get time sniped.
[20:45.800 --> 20:46.060]  Yeah.
[20:46.340 --> 20:47.740]  Let's not time snipe any strikes.
[20:48.900 --> 20:51.560]  I haven't been really invested in the show in a long time.
[20:51.820 --> 20:55.620]  I'd love to have like a seven season show that I care about.
[20:56.020 --> 20:58.960]  Hmm. I just keep hearing people talk about and or.
[20:59.680 --> 21:01.260]  Oh, I couldn't care less.
[21:01.560 --> 21:04.360]  Maybe it'll be the twenty eighteen version of Charmed.
[21:04.780 --> 21:06.620]  Oh, God, we have to watch Charmed.
[21:07.100 --> 21:08.340]  Yeah, we have to do that.
[21:08.440 --> 21:09.320]  We have to watch six episodes.
[21:10.180 --> 21:15.140]  Have you ever seen five people lose that much enthusiasm for a good idea that quickly?
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.980]  I still have enthusiasm for it.
[21:21.040 --> 21:22.840]  Just Jeff went away right after we did it.
[21:22.900 --> 21:24.920]  So just like it went in the back burner.
[21:25.400 --> 21:27.620]  I'm ready to get to it when you put it on the calendar.
[21:28.040 --> 21:28.440]  We do.
[21:28.440 --> 21:30.540]  I don't even know what Charmed is about.
[21:31.200 --> 21:31.660]  They're witches.

[23:34.500 --> 23:34.840]  Five.
[23:35.700 --> 23:36.380]  Seventy five.
[23:37.340 --> 23:38.780]  Well, hold on. Let me try it.
[23:39.280 --> 23:40.360]  All right. It's not going to be five.
[23:40.460 --> 23:41.280]  Seventy five.
[23:41.760 --> 23:42.680]  Why wouldn't it be five?
[23:43.280 --> 23:43.840]  Yeah, why not?
[23:44.220 --> 23:46.300]  I don't want to ask a question about the index.
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.460]  Uh...
[23:51.740 --> 23:52.700]  How many...
[23:52.700 --> 23:54.360]  How many fla...
[23:54.360 --> 23:55.340]  How many...
[23:57.500 --> 23:59.420]  Trying to figure out how to ask this.
[23:59.740 --> 24:00.900]  Let's go with the index. I don't know, man.
[24:01.580 --> 24:07.680]  How many ships are registered, have a flag registration in Panama as of 2022?
[24:08.660 --> 24:08.900]  What?
[24:09.860 --> 24:13.020]  How many ships, how many ships, seafaring ships are registered in Panama?
[24:13.180 --> 24:14.480]  Now, I want to be very clear.
[24:14.480 --> 24:16.780]  You know the answer to this question, right?
[24:16.840 --> 24:19.740]  We're not, we're not going to all speculate on...
[24:19.740 --> 24:20.480]  I'm looking at it.
[24:20.640 --> 24:20.920]  Okay.
[24:21.560 --> 24:22.580]  I'm doing my little domino.
[24:22.940 --> 24:23.880]  Ninety two hundred.
[24:24.540 --> 24:24.980]  Okay.
[24:25.520 --> 24:26.980]  Eric says ninety two hundred.
[24:27.280 --> 24:29.820]  How many ships were registered in Panama?
[24:30.220 --> 24:33.000]  Okay. You know, you register your ship in different countries based on, like,
[24:33.220 --> 24:34.460]  what laws you're trying to skirt.
[24:34.920 --> 24:35.300]  Oh, huh.
[24:36.720 --> 24:39.300]  A lot, a lot of ships are registered in the Bahamas, for instance.
[24:39.640 --> 24:41.120]  Really? I didn't know that.
[24:41.660 --> 24:41.840]  Yeah.
[24:42.400 --> 24:43.220]  That's wild.
[24:43.220 --> 24:45.220]  The city or the country?
[24:45.800 --> 24:47.840]  Panama feels like a 70s rock band.
[24:47.940 --> 24:49.700]  Not Panama City, Panama Country.
[24:50.060 --> 24:51.780]  With the canal, the big canal.
[24:51.980 --> 24:53.820]  Well, the Panama is a Van Halen song.
[24:54.100 --> 24:55.860]  Yeah, that's a Van Halen song, Andrew.
[24:56.700 --> 24:57.180]  Panama!
[24:59.040 --> 25:00.780]  And it's a, what is it?
[25:00.800 --> 25:01.960]  A man a planet canal, Panama?
[25:02.700 --> 25:05.540]  I would guess it's the same forward as backwards.
[25:06.060 --> 25:06.700]  Forty five hundred.
[25:07.120 --> 25:07.980]  Forty five hundred.
[25:08.100 --> 25:09.440]  Eric said ninety two hundred.
[25:09.660 --> 25:11.680]  And Nick and the other one, Andrew.
[25:12.100 --> 25:12.620]  Six thousand.
[25:13.220 --> 25:13.660]  OK.
[25:14.660 --> 25:15.780]  I'll do seven thousand.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.220]  Eight thousand twenty five.
[25:19.600 --> 25:20.540]  Oh, wow.
[25:20.640 --> 25:22.560]  So I guess Nick gets it.
[25:22.580 --> 25:23.380]  Yeah, Nick wins.
[25:23.840 --> 25:24.600]  By fifty.
[25:25.120 --> 25:25.800]  We were pretty close.
[25:26.380 --> 25:27.260]  Yeah, you guys weren't bad.
[25:27.600 --> 25:33.060]  For bonus round, what percent of the total number of ships in the world is that?
[25:33.840 --> 25:34.340]  One second.
[25:34.780 --> 25:35.760]  Wait, time out.
[25:36.380 --> 25:39.220]  There is actually a song called Panama by Van Halen.
[25:39.320 --> 25:40.260]  That's what they've been saying.
[25:40.280 --> 25:41.560]  You were just singing it.
[25:41.720 --> 25:42.160]  I didn't.
[25:42.160 --> 25:43.480]  I was doing a joke.
[25:43.600 --> 25:44.080]  I didn't know that.
[25:44.320 --> 25:46.120]  No, you were singing the song Panama.
[25:46.340 --> 25:48.300]  I thought they said like the lyrics.
[25:48.660 --> 25:51.380]  Animal, ba da ba ba da da da da da da.
[25:52.540 --> 25:54.300]  That's that's that's Panama.
[25:54.640 --> 25:55.840]  You've heard this on Panama.
[25:56.140 --> 25:57.680]  You're singing the name of the song.
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.440]  I didn't. I just Googled it.
[25:59.500 --> 26:00.400]  That's crazy.
[26:00.920 --> 26:02.060]  That's the tune of Panama.
[26:02.480 --> 26:03.220]  You sang Panama.
[26:03.800 --> 26:05.600]  Yeah, I didn't know I was saying Panama.
[26:05.840 --> 26:06.120]  The fuck?
[26:06.640 --> 26:11.240]  I was trying to make a joke that it sounded like the song, but it was OK.
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.280]  Is that the first time someone learned the lyrics through their own brain?
[26:17.280 --> 26:19.520]  That was completely an internal discovery.
[26:20.040 --> 26:22.780]  Hey, yeah, I really I didn't know.
[26:23.060 --> 26:26.380]  I thought it was like animal, ba da ba da da da da.
[26:26.940 --> 26:27.680]  Sorry, boats?
[26:28.560 --> 26:29.640]  I don't even know now.
[26:29.840 --> 26:30.940]  Nick, you won a vinyl.
[26:31.200 --> 26:32.780]  Congratulations. I'll give you a vinyl.
[26:33.460 --> 26:34.720]  We're back in our vinyl.
[26:35.200 --> 26:35.880]  Dude, we're doing that again?
[26:36.460 --> 26:36.780]  Why not?
[26:37.200 --> 26:38.320]  Can we keep this vinyl?
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.120]  Can we get a stereo and a record player and some speakers?
[26:41.120 --> 26:43.760]  At the studio, so we can listen to these vinyls together?
[26:43.920 --> 26:45.620]  I would hope so. Yeah, absolutely.
[26:46.400 --> 26:48.780]  Oh, I'm going to ask the robot do some DJing.
[26:49.560 --> 26:49.960]  Wow.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.920]  You can like skid your tires on the record.
[26:52.160 --> 26:53.140]  Yeah, a robot.
[26:53.740 --> 26:54.980]  That's a great idea.
[26:55.900 --> 26:58.840]  Let's pick a terrible record that nobody cares about.
[26:58.920 --> 27:00.960]  So it doesn't matter that I'm damaging it. Bye.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.920]  Yep. I got a bunch for you, don't worry.
[27:03.700 --> 27:06.200]  Oh, that's a fun game, Jeff. Boats.
[27:07.300 --> 27:08.360]  Boats. Boats.
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.440]  Do you ever, when was the last time you had like a childhood show
[27:12.440 --> 27:14.340]  you forgot about, like pop back up?
[27:14.700 --> 27:17.620]  I just remembered Theodore the tugboat.
[27:19.540 --> 27:22.340]  Thinking of boats and it brought back so many memories.
[27:23.440 --> 27:25.400]  It was a boat show I used to watch when I was four.
[27:25.500 --> 27:27.420]  It was like knockoff Thomas the Tank Engine.
[27:27.780 --> 27:30.620]  It is exactly like Thomas the Tank Engine, but a boat.
[27:31.080 --> 27:33.260]  Has a great theme song is what I learned.
[27:33.960 --> 27:35.060]  It was Panama.
[27:36.080 --> 27:37.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:38.680 --> 27:40.360]  Tugboat. Oh, oh, oh.
[27:41.660 --> 27:43.620]  You know, it happened to me recently.
[27:44.300 --> 27:48.420]  I was, I don't know, looking at TikTok or something, and I saw a trailer
[27:48.420 --> 27:51.480]  or a little clip from a show called Today's Special that I used to watch
[27:51.480 --> 27:53.740]  all the time when I was a kid, and I had no memory of it until I saw the image.
[27:54.360 --> 27:55.080]  Today's Special.
[27:55.800 --> 27:57.040]  It's a Canadian show, actually.
[27:57.160 --> 27:57.980]  I didn't really know.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.680]  Ran from 81 to 87.
[28:00.340 --> 28:03.920]  And I just really loved the puppet who has the hat on,
[28:03.920 --> 28:05.040]  like the little old man puppet.
[28:06.120 --> 28:07.620]  Oh, yeah, over the shoulder.
[28:07.740 --> 28:09.260]  Yeah, that's a great puppet.
[28:09.620 --> 28:10.640]  That guy's got character.
[28:11.260 --> 28:11.820]  Yeah, he does.
[28:12.580 --> 28:15.400]  That dog looks like he drinks with that man in a bar.
[28:15.540 --> 28:18.840]  That's the most you just sent the most British looking thing.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.060]  Yeah, mine was Button Moon.
[28:20.740 --> 28:21.540]  Button Moon.
[28:21.900 --> 28:22.940]  The fuck is that?
[28:23.020 --> 28:24.160]  Button Moon and Mr. Spoon.
[28:24.840 --> 28:25.400]  Oh, phenomenal.
[28:25.840 --> 28:27.380]  Button Moon and Mr. Spoon?
[28:27.640 --> 28:30.800]  Yeah, they're all like little like kitchen utensil people with like bottles
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.920]  and shit and the rocket was a baked beans tin.
[28:34.680 --> 28:38.660]  Any time you share like childhood entertainment that you enjoyed,
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.700]  it explains so much about you.
[28:40.900 --> 28:42.620]  You're such a Button Moon guy.
[28:43.140 --> 28:44.780]  I was a huge Button Moon guy.
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.260]  Maybe you'd like the theme tune.
[28:46.280 --> 28:47.180]  Maybe I could find that.
[28:47.660 --> 28:48.320]  Love it.
[28:49.640 --> 28:53.560]  Tattooed teenage alien fighters from Beverly Hills.
[28:53.800 --> 28:59.360]  It was a knockoff shitty like USA Power Rangers show.
[28:59.600 --> 29:03.340]  Oh, and I watch it and I just go like, I kind of get what's happening here.
[29:03.340 --> 29:06.640]  Like I get what this is trying to be, you're trying to do.
[29:06.800 --> 29:08.920]  But I'm like, I guess I'll watch it like I'm invested.
[29:09.120 --> 29:09.840]  And man, it is.
[29:10.380 --> 29:13.000]  It looks like Dollar Store Mortal Kombat.
[29:13.500 --> 29:15.060]  Big time. It's bad.
[29:15.500 --> 29:15.860]  It's really bad.
[29:15.860 --> 29:18.800]  The dude in the bottom right in the black pleather shorts.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.360]  That is quite an outfit.
[29:20.460 --> 29:22.840]  And he's like jabbing you with a pugil stick.
[29:23.160 --> 29:26.220]  Yeah. And it looks like everybody huffed silver paint.
[29:26.420 --> 29:27.220]  Yeah, it does.
[29:27.900 --> 29:32.380]  Dude, dude, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, it fucking does.
[29:32.380 --> 29:34.200]  It really, really does.
[29:34.300 --> 29:37.820]  It looks like a lot of the kids that dropped out of my high school.
[29:39.040 --> 29:41.680]  They look like dropped out of Immortan Joe's crew.
[29:41.900 --> 29:44.100]  Yeah, it's the same thing.
[29:44.420 --> 29:46.100]  Oh, Eureka's Castle was awesome.
[29:46.140 --> 29:48.420]  I just posted Eureka's Castle.
[29:48.760 --> 29:49.860]  Isn't that an R.L.
[29:50.040 --> 29:52.260]  Stein show? Yeah, it was.
[29:52.660 --> 29:52.840]  Isn't that crazy?
[29:53.500 --> 29:54.440]  Yeah, that's insane.
[29:55.760 --> 29:56.620]  Oh, here's Button Moon.
[29:57.760 --> 29:58.380]  Button Moon?
[29:58.540 --> 30:00.740]  I want to just hear a moment, let me see.
[30:03.900 --> 30:04.860]  Oh, OK.
[30:05.120 --> 30:06.720]  Yeah, this is great.
[30:08.980 --> 30:11.820]  Button Moon, love to Button Moon.
[30:12.840 --> 30:13.440]  That's the next song.
[30:13.740 --> 30:16.500]  Hey, Nick, you should make your kid watch that and see if it holds his attention
[30:16.500 --> 30:17.540]  longer than three seconds.
[30:19.020 --> 30:20.560]  That is such a great.
[30:20.720 --> 30:25.260]  I mean, I don't want to put Nick's kid in the content like as an outsider.
[30:25.520 --> 30:28.600]  But the premise of us picking what we think were banger
[30:28.600 --> 30:33.880]  childhood shows and seeing Nick's kid grade them is very funny.
[30:34.920 --> 30:36.340]  Oh, all right.
[30:36.460 --> 30:39.380]  Do you think he would like this guy from the Great Space Coaster?
[30:39.460 --> 30:40.060]  That's another one.
[30:40.220 --> 30:42.340]  Oh, I don't know if I like that guy.
[30:42.400 --> 30:42.980]  I'm terrified.
[30:43.140 --> 30:45.280]  It's like a a clown almost.
[30:45.420 --> 30:49.420]  He has a red nose, a rainbow shirt, and he's very large.
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.020]  Hollow eyes.
[30:51.080 --> 30:52.140]  Look at this fucking elephant, though.
[30:52.220 --> 30:56.160]  Doesn't that look like the stuff we did at Meow Wolf, Gavin?
[30:56.880 --> 30:58.160]  Yeah, it does.
[30:58.240 --> 30:59.880]  Like the ears and all the different sounds.
[31:00.120 --> 31:01.500]  Yeah. Wow.
[31:02.160 --> 31:06.160]  Yeah, that clown looks like if an animal dressed as a human, it would kind of look like that.
[31:06.640 --> 31:07.460]  Yeah. Yeah.
[31:07.860 --> 31:09.600]  He looks like he's got a knife.
[31:09.900 --> 31:11.300]  I think. It does.
[31:12.560 --> 31:14.740]  He would definitely be stopped at TSA.
[31:15.240 --> 31:15.920]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[31:16.100 --> 31:17.500]  Yeah. They're checking his phone.
[31:18.020 --> 31:19.500]  They want to look at his social media.
[31:20.240 --> 31:23.760]  He has a bomb strapped to his heart rate monitor at all times.
[31:23.760 --> 31:26.360]  So if he goes, everyone else is going around him.
[31:26.680 --> 31:27.940]  You know what else about that clown, though?
[31:28.040 --> 31:29.980]  I guarantee you he uses a CPAP.
[31:30.580 --> 31:32.240]  Yeah. Yeah.
[31:32.360 --> 31:34.360]  He has to. He has to. He doesn't have a choice.
[31:35.420 --> 31:39.080]  Yeah. And the magician conjures it up so it doesn't really work too well.
[31:39.400 --> 31:42.920]  Like this whole thing, this whole thing.
[31:43.020 --> 31:44.500]  It's made out of like wishes and dreams.
[31:44.640 --> 31:46.140]  So it's like really fucking them up at night.
[31:47.620 --> 31:49.120]  From wishes and dreams.
[31:49.940 --> 31:51.140]  Jeff, Teddy Ruxpin.
[31:51.340 --> 31:52.980]  Teddy Ruxpin, was that like a thing?
[31:52.980 --> 31:54.540]  You were like too old for that or no?
[31:54.960 --> 31:56.800]  I was too old for Teddy Ruxpin, but not.
[31:56.880 --> 31:58.100]  But I wasn't like that.
[31:58.460 --> 32:00.720]  I wasn't so old. I wasn't like very aware of it.
[32:00.900 --> 32:03.160]  Right. Right. I mean, it was like a big it was like a big thing.
[32:03.300 --> 32:05.280]  So let's see. He came out in.
[32:05.380 --> 32:08.240]  Let me see. Teddy Ruxpin came out in nineteen.
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.240]  Probably the mid 80s, I would think.
[32:11.080 --> 32:13.100]  Eighty six, I guess. Eighty five, eighty six.
[32:13.140 --> 32:14.360]  I was ten, eleven.
[32:14.680 --> 32:16.220]  They were probably just a bit too old.
[32:16.280 --> 32:18.440]  If I'd have been like three years younger, I'd have probably been right up his ass.
[32:18.720 --> 32:20.620]  Yeah, I was curious.
[32:20.620 --> 32:22.300]  His ass? I don't know about.
[32:22.540 --> 32:24.260]  I don't know if that's the way you want to describe Teddy Ruxpin.
[32:24.500 --> 32:25.200]  But yeah, man, that's cool.
[32:25.540 --> 32:28.600]  That's I don't. Yeah, it was the 80s were different.
[32:29.380 --> 32:30.320]  They sure were.
[32:30.920 --> 32:34.120]  I know you keep showing us a bunch of different fucking 80s stuff,
[32:34.140 --> 32:35.420]  and I don't want to watch it.
[32:38.120 --> 32:40.300]  At least I didn't make you watch the losing it.
[32:40.660 --> 32:42.320]  Oh, fuck. Please no.
[32:43.080 --> 32:43.960]  It's so bad.
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.120]  Uh, Gavin, did you guys have Teddy Ruxpin in England or was his name like
[32:48.120 --> 32:49.220]  they have like a different name?
[32:49.220 --> 32:50.340]  Ruxy Spinspin.
[32:50.620 --> 32:52.360]  Or is it like a totally like foreign thing to you?
[32:52.400 --> 32:54.940]  Yeah, it might have been like Ruxy Buxy or I don't know.
[32:55.260 --> 32:57.220]  I'll let me know. Does that look like Ruxy Buxy?
[32:57.520 --> 32:58.360]  Yeah, that's him.
[33:00.000 --> 33:01.080]  Ruxy Buxy.
[33:01.820 --> 33:02.680]  It's Reginald Buxton.
[33:03.260 --> 33:05.420]  Yeah, Theodore Buxton.
[33:09.580 --> 33:13.180]  I felt so sort of exciting news.
[33:13.600 --> 33:16.280]  Shane, pencil judge extraordinaire,
[33:16.960 --> 33:20.940]  survivor contestant has joined our community discord.
[33:20.940 --> 33:23.040]  Which was very exciting.
[33:23.420 --> 33:24.660]  And that is insane to me.
[33:24.900 --> 33:26.020]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[33:26.180 --> 33:30.320]  And he posted the sweetest message when he joined, just like thanking
[33:30.320 --> 33:34.520]  all the regulation listeners and comment leavers and whatnot for support.
[33:36.120 --> 33:38.380]  And it was like this exciting moment.
[33:38.400 --> 33:41.540]  And people are like, Whoa, this the jeans here.
[33:41.540 --> 33:42.960]  That's crazy. That's awesome.
[33:43.480 --> 33:46.020]  And then like the fourth reply was Mark
[33:46.020 --> 33:48.940]  the Frog complaining about having to use body wash shampoo.
[33:48.940 --> 33:50.520]  And I felt so bad.
[33:50.620 --> 33:52.340]  God, he's the fucking best.
[33:52.700 --> 33:55.860]  He's just like, just in his own world.
[33:56.540 --> 34:00.180]  Does it have any concept of anything that's happening?
[34:01.780 --> 34:03.300]  I love him so much.
[34:03.440 --> 34:04.600]  I love him so much.
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.160]  He is a unique human being, for sure.
[34:08.900 --> 34:10.180]  Have you met him, Jeff?
[34:10.800 --> 34:11.320]  In person?
[34:11.820 --> 34:14.640]  Yeah, well, that was no, no, no.
[34:14.740 --> 34:17.280]  He was he was saying he was I was trying to throw away baseball cards
[34:17.280 --> 34:18.560]  and he was like, I'm a drive up and get them.
[34:18.560 --> 34:21.300]  And I was like, if you want to drive all the way up from Florida, you can have them.
[34:21.660 --> 34:22.740]  But I don't think he's actually going to do it.
[34:22.800 --> 34:25.720]  He calculated the gas and it was going to be over $1,000 in gas.
[34:26.480 --> 34:27.120]  Holy shit.
[34:27.680 --> 34:28.560]  Maybe not worth it.
[34:28.560 --> 34:29.520]  It's not worth it for some guards.
[34:30.140 --> 34:30.780]  Hell no.
[34:30.880 --> 34:31.980]  Not for these guards, for sure.
[34:32.840 --> 34:35.020]  Do you ever think about the turkey you left in that fridge?
[34:35.380 --> 34:36.480]  I still think about it.
[34:37.500 --> 34:38.460]  The hotel fridge.
[34:41.020 --> 34:43.660]  I'd be lying if I said no.
[34:46.160 --> 34:47.200]  What happened to it?
[34:47.200 --> 34:48.660]  It's like one of our great mysteries.
[34:48.780 --> 34:49.380]  We'll never know.
[34:49.500 --> 34:50.960]  But here's what bugs me about it.
[34:51.020 --> 34:53.600]  It smelled so good and it looked so amazing.
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.500]  And then I ordered another one, you know, like a month later for Christmas.
[34:57.820 --> 34:59.420]  And it just wasn't great.
[34:59.680 --> 35:01.260]  It wasn't anywhere near that I remember.
[35:01.800 --> 35:05.480]  And I feel like that the first turkey was, though.
[35:05.900 --> 35:08.480]  Yeah, you lost the hot dog roulette with the turkeys.
[35:08.580 --> 35:10.940]  Yeah, I feel like I lost hot dog roulette on the turkeys.
[35:10.960 --> 35:13.760]  And I feel like the vibe of the first turkey was fucking aces.
[35:13.760 --> 35:18.960]  And I and then this kind of tainted like now I don't necessarily want to go
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.020]  and pay like 70 bucks to, you know, have another turkey shipped to me
[35:23.680 --> 35:26.360]  on dry ice or whatever, because I already did it twice.
[35:26.360 --> 35:28.360]  And I didn't really enjoy the one that I had.
[35:28.400 --> 35:31.120]  But damn it, I just it breaks my heart.
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.060]  Is that the number one item for heartbreak that you've ever misplaced
[35:36.060 --> 35:38.640]  or like lost, could not retrieve again?
[35:40.980 --> 35:42.020]  No, no.
[35:42.020 --> 35:46.380]  Back when I was drinking, I gave somebody all of my baseball cards
[35:46.380 --> 35:49.360]  and comic books, and I don't remember who. Oh, God.
[35:50.580 --> 35:51.840]  I remember doing it.
[35:51.940 --> 35:55.840]  I remember going into the back house and digging them out of a pile of crap
[35:55.840 --> 35:58.300]  and being like, if your kid can have these, if they want them,
[35:58.320 --> 35:59.080]  they'll never be worth anything.
[35:59.240 --> 36:00.280]  I don't want them. I'll never use them.
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.340]  And and I just I cannot for the life of me remember who that human being was.
[36:05.340 --> 36:07.360]  But I gave them thousands and thousands.
[36:07.760 --> 36:10.520]  And looking back on it now, I so desperately wanted them
[36:10.520 --> 36:11.660]  when I started collecting again.
[36:11.860 --> 36:13.600]  And I really regret that.
[36:14.040 --> 36:15.860]  I really regret giving up my entire childhood
[36:16.680 --> 36:18.680]  because I think I was probably really drunk.
[36:18.840 --> 36:21.460]  I like that that's the version of person you become when you're drunk.
[36:21.580 --> 36:22.380]  They're just generous.
[36:23.340 --> 36:24.680]  Yeah, no, I guess so.
[36:24.880 --> 36:27.780]  That's that's a tough situation, because even if you knew who it was,
[36:28.020 --> 36:29.960]  it's still not easy to get the back.
[36:30.260 --> 36:32.100]  No, and I wouldn't try to get behind that.
[36:32.600 --> 36:35.700]  I wouldn't try to get him back, but I might check in with that person
[36:35.700 --> 36:37.960]  and be like, hey, you remember, like 10 years ago when I gave you all that?
[36:37.960 --> 36:38.900]  You can't like it.
[36:38.980 --> 36:39.640]  Well, they appreciate it.
[36:39.660 --> 36:41.240]  You know, I never heard back, you know.
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.240]  I hope that was a good gift, you know.
[36:44.460 --> 36:47.960]  I feel like it almost is in a way an advantage that you don't know.
[36:48.280 --> 36:49.120]  It's probably better.
[36:49.260 --> 36:52.320]  I see some 17 year old kid driving around in a fucking brand new car
[36:52.320 --> 36:53.760]  that he bought off all my old baseball cards.
[36:55.860 --> 36:57.940]  What do you what do you estimate the value of them was?
[36:58.560 --> 36:59.500]  You know, I don't know.
[36:59.540 --> 37:02.620]  I would love to go back and look because there's stuff that wasn't valuable
[37:02.620 --> 37:06.260]  than that is now and and stuff that was valuable than that isn't valuable now.
[37:06.260 --> 37:08.980]  And so I really don't know what I had, but.
[37:09.080 --> 37:09.840]  Do you have any pictures of him?
[37:10.080 --> 37:12.980]  No, a couple thousand on the low end.
[37:13.080 --> 37:13.660]  And who knows?
[37:14.220 --> 37:18.000]  Like some of my 80s football cards were worth a lot.
[37:18.240 --> 37:19.960]  Like I had Jerry Rice rookie back in the day.
[37:19.960 --> 37:21.120]  That's a lot of money now.
[37:21.960 --> 37:23.060]  But yeah, I don't know.
[37:23.560 --> 37:25.040]  I just I really don't.
[37:25.980 --> 37:26.340]  I don't.
[37:26.440 --> 37:29.880]  I stopped collecting at 17 and I hadn't looked at them since I was 17.
[37:30.200 --> 37:31.940]  So what about you, Gavin?
[37:32.020 --> 37:34.000]  Have you ever misplaced anything valuable to you?
[37:36.160 --> 37:38.440]  Um, yeah, I.
[37:39.700 --> 37:41.120]  It's always game consoles.
[37:41.420 --> 37:43.520]  Like, I really wish I had my childhood Super Nintendo.
[37:44.060 --> 37:47.720]  Yeah, I have that chromed, that chrome skinned original Xbox
[37:47.720 --> 37:49.260]  that I don't know where it is.
[37:49.520 --> 37:51.900]  I just I think my parents just gave them away.
[37:52.340 --> 37:53.800]  Well, I gave them to friends and stuff.
[37:54.300 --> 37:56.300]  And I could just buy the same thing.
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.020]  But it's just like, ah, this is not the same.
[37:58.220 --> 38:02.220]  This wasn't what got me into gaming as a little four year old.
[38:03.400 --> 38:04.500]  Little chrome Xbox.
[38:05.680 --> 38:07.260]  Well, that was a bit later, but the Super Nintendo.
[38:07.600 --> 38:08.000]  Yeah, I know.
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.300]  I just I like the idea of it being chrome being like, you know what?
[38:11.300 --> 38:13.680]  I don't think I would have been an Xbox guy, but then they chromed it.
[38:13.880 --> 38:14.420]  Holy shit.
[38:14.720 --> 38:16.720]  I just remember spending a lot of time with the hairdryer
[38:16.720 --> 38:18.760]  and that sticker to get it just right with no air bubbles.
[38:21.900 --> 38:25.720]  I had a kind of a similar thing where back in the old, old, old days,
[38:25.780 --> 38:27.520]  Gus and I used to go to garage sales all the time.
[38:27.580 --> 38:29.260]  We used to make content out of it for drunk gamers.
[38:29.860 --> 38:32.160]  And the thing that we were really doing was trying to buy video games.
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.560]  And old game consoles, because that's what we were into.
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.980]  And so we had so much success.
[38:38.100 --> 38:41.100]  And I had about 13 or 14 old consoles, like a TurboGrafx-16,
[38:41.460 --> 38:43.960]  a bunch of a bunch of fun old stuff, Sega Saturn, Sega CD,
[38:44.600 --> 38:45.920]  and that we had collected over the years.
[38:46.080 --> 38:47.180]  And I didn't have anywhere to put them.
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.380]  So I put them up in the attic in the first house that I owned
[38:49.920 --> 38:50.960]  when we lived there together.
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.100]  And then after I sold the house and moved,
[38:54.260 --> 38:58.160]  I realized about like two weeks after I'd moved, I never cleaned out the attic.
[38:58.360 --> 39:00.120]  I have all those consoles up there.
[39:00.120 --> 39:01.180]  And I thought,
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.140]  I'm definitely not going to go bug the new owner to crawl up there and get them.
[39:07.360 --> 39:09.980]  So I guess I don't collect consoles anymore.
[39:10.240 --> 39:10.960]  And I haven't since.
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.240]  I was like, if I don't want it badly enough to go do that, go have that inconvenience.
[39:14.460 --> 39:15.800]  I guess I just don't want that shit anymore.
[39:15.840 --> 39:17.400]  And I should stop buying it. So I did.
[39:17.760 --> 39:18.700]  That's kind of heisted.
[39:20.060 --> 39:22.880]  Like, like, like Andrew with the Chinese food menus.
[39:23.200 --> 39:25.380]  Yeah. Sneak in, get your stuff.
[39:25.500 --> 39:27.640]  A bit harder when it's on the inside there. Yeah, yeah.
[39:29.160 --> 39:31.300]  But technically, it would just be trespass, right?
[39:31.500 --> 39:33.420]  Or breaking in a ring, it wouldn't be actual burglary.
[39:33.980 --> 39:36.360]  Well, I sold the house to her and everything in it.
[39:36.440 --> 39:39.560]  So like, if I went in and started pulling out the oven, that wouldn't be cool either.
[39:40.260 --> 39:42.600]  Like, I decided after the fact I wanted this oven.
[39:43.940 --> 39:46.460]  I think she, the lady owned them at that point.
[39:46.860 --> 39:51.560]  I have an exciting thing to reveal relating to our movie leak.
[39:51.980 --> 39:55.820]  I teased it in the past that we have a trophy for first place.
[39:56.260 --> 39:57.700]  I currently have. Oh, hell yeah.
[39:58.120 --> 40:00.040]  A relic, a symbol of victory.
[40:00.400 --> 40:02.320]  There are many things we could have went with.
[40:02.680 --> 40:05.940]  I think this there's no greater than this.
[40:06.200 --> 40:07.760]  I currently have it in my possession.
[40:08.660 --> 40:13.160]  The trophy of our movie league is none other than a rare
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.460]  collectible sealed copy of VHS
[40:18.460 --> 40:24.200]  Mouse Hunt 9.4 graded A++ seal quality.
[40:25.160 --> 40:25.640]  Phenomenal.
[40:26.860 --> 40:28.420]  Andrew, that's gorgeous.
[40:29.180 --> 40:30.140]  It's beautiful.
[40:30.380 --> 40:34.520]  We have a little bit of a history of the film because I was the past winner.
[40:34.920 --> 40:36.420]  I'm currently holding it.
[40:36.660 --> 40:38.580]  But whoever wins gets the mouse hunt.
[40:39.260 --> 40:41.180]  And that one didn't get stolen from your doorstep.
[40:41.420 --> 40:43.980]  It didn't. No, that one made it.
[40:44.620 --> 40:45.960]  That's great. Thank heavens.
[40:46.680 --> 40:47.880]  It was so cool.
[40:48.300 --> 40:50.720]  Yeah. It's got the picture of them in the mousetraps on the back.
[40:51.100 --> 40:53.040]  And Lee Evans has it on his lip. Amazing.
[40:53.040 --> 40:55.800]  I think it's the only one out there.
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.820]  I don't think there are any other graded mouse hunts on VHS.
[40:59.720 --> 41:02.980]  Wow. One of one. One of one.
[41:03.840 --> 41:07.560]  And speaking of the movie league, I've already had my first disappointment.
[41:08.180 --> 41:12.120]  I thought I had the steal of the fucking draft with fight or flight,
[41:12.220 --> 41:14.660]  and it made two million dollars total.
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.980]  I never saw it advertised once.
[41:19.440 --> 41:21.640]  Yeah, I don't think it was really.
[41:21.640 --> 41:24.240]  I thought it was I got sucked in.
[41:24.340 --> 41:25.860]  I think I thought the premise was so fun.
[41:26.320 --> 41:27.980]  It's already out of theaters.
[41:27.980 --> 41:29.960]  I think it's not tracking.
[41:30.320 --> 41:34.820]  I realized it was in trouble when it opened in like eighth place
[41:34.820 --> 41:38.660]  and clown in a cornfield opened on the same weekend and was in sixth.
[41:39.140 --> 41:43.480]  And worse than clown in a cornfield, which I'm so fucking sick of.
[41:43.520 --> 41:47.400]  By the way, I was so convinced that I owned it,
[41:47.420 --> 41:50.120]  that the algorithm also thought I owned it.
[41:50.120 --> 41:52.320]  So I keep getting ads for it.
[41:52.400 --> 41:56.500]  I'm getting push notifications that I should go see clown in a cornfield.
[41:56.680 --> 41:58.020]  I should go buy tickets.
[41:58.260 --> 41:59.400]  It's so annoying.
[41:59.880 --> 42:01.440]  Do you know who directed clown in a cornfield?
[42:01.540 --> 42:03.480]  I found out later who you like, Craig.
[42:03.860 --> 42:06.280]  Oh, Tucker and Dale guy, right? Yeah.
[42:06.300 --> 42:07.420]  But he's a Nepo baby.
[42:07.540 --> 42:08.800]  Do you know who his mother is?
[42:09.300 --> 42:10.740]  Craig. Craig.
[42:11.200 --> 42:13.060]  It's not not same last night. Nope. OK.
[42:13.840 --> 42:15.660]  No. Sally Field.
[42:15.660 --> 42:17.480]  What? Oh, yeah.
[42:17.520 --> 42:20.380]  Sally Field's son made a clown in a cornfield.
[42:20.760 --> 42:23.320]  Yep. What? Could have been Daniel Craig's son.
[42:24.020 --> 42:26.060]  Could have been Daniel Craig's son.
[42:26.480 --> 42:27.900]  Yeah. They should do a DNA test.
[42:27.980 --> 42:29.400]  Maybe find a check of paternity.
[42:30.420 --> 42:35.700]  I like the idea of like 23 and me, but just for nepotism in Hollywood.
[42:35.880 --> 42:39.260]  You can see all of the celebrities you're kind of related to.
[42:39.460 --> 42:42.260]  Well, just like a big branching line of Nepo.
[42:45.080 --> 42:48.440]  I'm 2% Coppola. This is great.
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.000]  Oh, man. Speaking of films, I was looking at the AFI.
[42:55.320 --> 42:56.740]  That's like the definitive list, right?
[42:56.760 --> 42:59.620]  The AFI list of the top 100 films of all time recently.
[42:59.760 --> 43:02.860]  Just just out of curiosity to see how many I had never seen,
[43:03.240 --> 43:04.160]  like how many I didn't recognize.
[43:04.420 --> 43:05.300]  And that got me thinking.
[43:05.340 --> 43:08.260]  I know we have a lot of movies to watch and a lot of TV shows
[43:08.260 --> 43:10.040]  and a lot of a lot of watch along stuff.
[43:10.080 --> 43:11.980]  I'm not trying to add on to it.
[43:11.980 --> 43:15.960]  But I wonder if we all marked off every movie
[43:15.960 --> 43:18.880]  we've seen on the list and overlaid the list together.
[43:18.980 --> 43:21.320]  How many movies collectively have collectively?
[43:21.660 --> 43:23.220]  None of us have seen. Oh, that's interesting.
[43:23.500 --> 43:26.840]  Like how many movies are on the 100 list that none of us have seen that?
[43:27.220 --> 43:30.620]  It might be a lot because there was a bunch of movies I'd never heard of on there.
[43:30.880 --> 43:32.740]  But it might be very, very small list.
[43:32.760 --> 43:33.120]  I don't know.
[43:33.620 --> 43:35.160]  Cosmopolis isn't on the list, right?
[43:35.560 --> 43:36.920]  Not that I'm aware. OK, good.
[43:38.600 --> 43:40.020]  There there's a list.
[43:40.520 --> 43:43.620]  You can mark off the ones that you've seen and then download a PDF
[43:43.620 --> 43:45.460]  with that link that I just. Oh, that's great.
[43:46.080 --> 43:46.940]  Oh, great. Amazing.
[43:47.180 --> 43:48.480]  Yeah, I'll look. I'll look at this from that.
[43:48.620 --> 43:52.840]  The one that we're looking at is AFI's 100 years, 100 movies,
[43:52.960 --> 43:55.460]  10th anniversary edition, though, which is older.
[43:55.660 --> 43:59.440]  And I wonder if maybe there's a more recent one.
[43:59.640 --> 44:01.120]  I mean, that seems like it might be it.
[44:01.140 --> 44:05.900]  So but it's like, you know, I've never seen
[44:06.480 --> 44:07.840]  a lot of these haven't seen.
[44:08.320 --> 44:10.800]  Oh, God, I'm trying to look at one that I have.
[44:10.900 --> 44:11.640]  Actually, I've seen all these.
[44:12.100 --> 44:13.380]  I've never seen The General.
[44:14.540 --> 44:15.600]  1926. Wow.
[44:16.160 --> 44:18.480]  I've never seen Sullivan's Travels.
[44:18.480 --> 44:19.540]  I've never seen Duck Soup.
[44:19.640 --> 44:20.760]  I know what it is, but I've never seen it.
[44:21.080 --> 44:23.160]  I've never seen the 1975 film Nashville.
[44:24.200 --> 44:27.840]  I feel like I don't feel like Cabaret needs to be on this list.
[44:30.580 --> 44:32.200]  Number 99 is Toy Story.
[44:32.540 --> 44:34.400]  I've seen it. I've seen that.
[44:35.100 --> 44:36.780]  Yeah. No, I know. I think.
[44:37.500 --> 44:38.920]  Right. Gavin, I've both seen that one.
[44:39.100 --> 44:42.500]  So you can go, I just won't bother with it then.
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.500]  Oh, let's mark that. Let's mark the list right now.
[44:44.580 --> 44:45.540]  That'd be boring for the audience.
[44:45.640 --> 44:46.900]  No, we'll do it. Yes. Yes.
[44:46.920 --> 44:49.180]  Yes, it would. It would be fun for us and boring for the audience.
[44:49.320 --> 44:49.880]  Yeah, we don't want to do that.
[44:50.120 --> 44:52.760]  No, I saw really it.
[44:53.120 --> 44:56.100]  Cosmopolis is the Francis Ford Coppola movie, right?
[44:56.140 --> 44:57.340]  That's his most recent one.
[44:58.260 --> 44:59.900]  Megalopolis. Megalopolis. Yeah. Yeah.
[45:00.500 --> 45:04.560]  I guess he doesn't want people to see that outside of the theater.
[45:04.560 --> 45:06.880]  Like, he's very strict about that.
[45:06.940 --> 45:09.660]  So you can't get it on VOD like at all.
[45:09.780 --> 45:11.820]  There's no like physical copies of it.
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.080]  He's only doing screenings that he's like personally doing.
[45:16.380 --> 45:18.920]  And the other way to currently watch it is, I guess
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.240]  they had a deal with American Airlines for playing it on flights.
[45:22.900 --> 45:26.220]  So those are the only two ways in which you can currently watch it
[45:26.220 --> 45:30.400]  is either a screening hosted by him or on American Airlines.
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.340]  Yeah, on your phone, on a two and a half hour flight to Denver.
[45:34.820 --> 45:36.400]  Yeah, absolutely. It's great.
[45:36.560 --> 45:38.160]  Yeah, like what's the reasoning for theaters only?
[45:38.280 --> 45:41.040]  Like he doesn't want tiny screens and then he wants it on a plane.
[45:41.660 --> 45:45.680]  Yeah, I guess. I don't know if it was like a distributor deal.
[45:46.220 --> 45:49.400]  Yeah, if I had to guess, it was probably they financed
[45:49.400 --> 45:51.680]  some portion of it through him, whatever.
[45:51.880 --> 45:52.580]  There was some deal.
[45:52.920 --> 45:54.640]  So they get the first crack at it.
[45:54.700 --> 45:56.720]  And so there was some time thing where he had to put it on there.
[45:56.720 --> 46:02.820]  But I think that there's like mixed media stuff in this movie.
[46:02.920 --> 46:06.440]  I haven't seen it, but I think there's like a section of the movie
[46:06.440 --> 46:11.900]  where somebody comes in, like acts something out in like in front of the people.
[46:12.020 --> 46:13.860]  And I think that's important to him.
[46:14.080 --> 46:16.080]  Yeah. And the flight attendants have to do it now.
[46:16.640 --> 46:18.140]  Yeah, you have to sync it up.
[46:18.200 --> 46:19.340]  So they only have to do it once, though.
[46:19.980 --> 46:22.760]  I I've heard nothing good about that film.
[46:23.220 --> 46:24.200]  I really want to see it.
[46:24.600 --> 46:25.800]  Well, it was in the theater for a while.
[46:26.460 --> 46:28.460]  Yeah, I just I didn't.
[46:28.460 --> 46:32.140]  I really want to see it in a way that Francis Ford Coppola doesn't want me to.
[46:33.400 --> 46:34.920]  Completely self-funded, too, right?
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.500]  Like, did he spend 300 million of his own money?
[46:36.520 --> 46:37.660]  He spent so much of his own money.
[46:37.720 --> 46:40.880]  I think he sold like an Italian winery he owned to fund it.
[46:41.100 --> 46:43.260]  Like, it's so it's the first thing to go.
[46:44.920 --> 46:45.960]  Sell off the vineyards.
[46:46.760 --> 46:48.680]  Oh, he's going to sell, too, but he forgot one.
[46:48.860 --> 46:49.900]  It's like, where is it?
[46:49.940 --> 46:50.560]  I don't remember.
[46:51.720 --> 46:53.000]  I don't remember where it is.
[46:53.200 --> 46:53.920]  I need my deed.
[46:54.790 --> 46:57.920]  Isn't that how Johnny Depp got into financial trouble?
[46:58.020 --> 46:59.340]  Is that he had too many vineyards?
[47:00.140 --> 47:01.740]  That's he was spending.
[47:02.020 --> 47:04.460]  I feel like I remember from that divorce case
[47:05.310 --> 47:10.580]  he was spending like $20,000 a month on wine just to drink.
[47:11.220 --> 47:15.020]  Oh, that's that's like I'm looking I'm crunching the numbers.
[47:15.140 --> 47:16.160]  That's a little high.
[47:16.380 --> 47:18.580]  I like Gavin's idea more.
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.800]  Let's just say that that's what he's in a really bad habit of getting drunk
[47:22.800 --> 47:26.040]  and then buying the vineyard that he was at or just having too many.
[47:27.940 --> 47:29.400]  Delicious, I'll take it.
[47:31.260 --> 47:33.900]  I just couldn't imagine being so wealthy
[47:33.900 --> 47:36.420]  that you own so many vineyards you didn't realize.
[47:37.120 --> 47:38.580]  I was I was wrong. I'm sorry.
[47:38.960 --> 47:42.320]  Johnny Depp spent $30,000 a month on liquor expenses,
[47:42.320 --> 47:45.340]  but his wine bill surged by four hundred and thirty three percent
[47:45.340 --> 47:46.500]  by the end of his marriage.
[47:46.800 --> 47:49.820]  God damn. Yeah. Wow.
[47:50.320 --> 47:52.900]  According to IMDB, huh?

[48:19.420 --> 48:21.860]  with a poster board I need for the science fair tomorrow?
[48:22.100 --> 48:25.500]  Probably. But can you get up to 40 percent off back to school essentials
[48:25.500 --> 48:27.060]  on Uber Eats? Definitely.
[48:27.580 --> 48:30.500]  So order on Uber Eats and get up to 40 percent off.
[48:30.760 --> 48:32.180]  Exclusions may apply. Check app for availability.
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.320]  I have a one question toilet quiz, if anyone's interested.
[48:36.520 --> 48:37.160]  Please. I'm in.
[48:37.360 --> 48:39.600]  It's based on a picture that I think I saw this on Reddit.
[48:39.740 --> 48:40.680]  And I just thought it was fascinating.
[48:41.480 --> 48:42.740]  Have you ever seen a toilet with that?
[48:43.120 --> 48:44.560]  You look at it. Let me zoom in.
[48:44.560 --> 48:45.420]  What is it?
[48:46.500 --> 48:47.540]  So it looks like.
[48:48.060 --> 48:49.780]  Boy, I hope that's from a hand.
[48:50.380 --> 48:51.720]  Is that rust? What is that?
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.180]  It's just a it's just an area of wear that appears on a lot of public toilets.
[48:56.420 --> 48:58.700]  It's just more like the enamel wore away or the paint.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.420]  Yeah, the paint has worn down in a very specific area.
[49:02.740 --> 49:06.160]  Is it the hand picking up and dropping it or is it somebody's ball?
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.660]  Dude, I hope it's somebody's hand reaching between their legs
[49:10.660 --> 49:16.620]  to wipe their ass and not a cock and ball slapping the same spot.
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.540]  Yeah, it turns out it's not the the residue from multiple cock and balls.
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.720]  Apparently, it's from women's rings.
[49:26.480 --> 49:28.360]  Oh, oh, here's another.
[49:28.820 --> 49:30.940]  Here's another thing about that toilet that I find odd.
[49:31.740 --> 49:32.860]  Where's the rest of the toilet?
[49:33.460 --> 49:34.220]  It's on some stairs.
[49:34.520 --> 49:35.200]  Hell yeah. Tell him, Jeff.
[49:35.560 --> 49:37.860]  Hell yeah. It's just a toilet seat on stairs.
[49:37.860 --> 49:40.980]  It's like that's an you try to use that.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.480]  What do you mean? You try to use that.
[49:42.740 --> 49:43.880]  That's an instant mess.
[49:44.560 --> 49:45.760]  Don't pee in that toilet.
[49:46.260 --> 49:48.260]  Use the toilet right there, right now.
[49:49.700 --> 49:54.280]  Well, maybe it's like a portable seat to use the bathroom anywhere you need.
[49:54.560 --> 49:56.300]  Yeah. Oh, you bring it along with you.
[49:56.600 --> 49:58.300]  Yeah. Take a shit right there on the stairs.
[49:59.580 --> 50:01.400]  It's like it's taller.
[50:01.800 --> 50:04.420]  It's like one of those stadium chairs you take to a little league game.
[50:04.440 --> 50:05.940]  Yeah. You get an academy.
[50:06.540 --> 50:09.100]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yep. Yep.
[50:09.960 --> 50:12.480]  I only assumed it was women.
[50:12.860 --> 50:16.400]  I do men. Men don't wipe from the front, right?
[50:17.040 --> 50:19.280]  I don't know. I don't know.
[50:19.400 --> 50:21.460]  No. You be wiping up towards your balls.
[50:25.540 --> 50:27.200]  It's getting down there, wiping my balls.
[50:27.480 --> 50:30.500]  I looked at that and I thought, I don't think I've ever put my hand down the front.
[50:31.580 --> 50:32.720]  No. Yeah.
[50:33.460 --> 50:35.060]  There's no room with all your business up there.
[50:35.060 --> 50:39.640]  Yeah, dude. Honestly, we got a shower the other way and we got to try wiping like this.
[50:39.740 --> 50:40.680]  We got to change it up a little bit.
[50:40.680 --> 50:41.980]  Gavin's a back shower, front wiper.
[50:42.660 --> 50:46.880]  I'm just worried if I was going underneath like that and I'm trying to get to the anus,
[50:47.340 --> 50:49.100]  I'm going to have like knuckles in the water.
[50:51.160 --> 50:52.600]  Knuckles in the water.
[50:52.760 --> 50:54.760]  Is that a song? Did Van Halen sing that?
[50:55.680 --> 50:56.440]  Am I good?
[50:57.200 --> 50:57.740]  Yeah, you're fine.
[50:58.040 --> 50:58.940]  Yeah, man, you're OK.
[50:59.380 --> 51:00.540]  It was called running with the devil.
[51:03.020 --> 51:04.980]  Oh, yeah, I guess the rings are dirty.
[51:05.540 --> 51:07.900]  Yeah, I think rings are super dirty, aren't they?
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.920]  Isn't that a thing where like you don't realize how dirty it is like phones?
[51:11.340 --> 51:12.560]  I don't think that's dirt.
[51:12.680 --> 51:13.460]  I think that's wear.
[51:14.080 --> 51:16.980]  No, I know, but it's still been scraping a toilet, public toilet seat.
[51:17.540 --> 51:18.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:18.580 --> 51:20.800]  Oh, so the ring is dirty with the paint from the toilet seat.
[51:21.080 --> 51:21.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:21.860 --> 51:22.620]  Some toilet enamel.
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.360]  Once again, where is the where'd you take this photo?
[51:25.800 --> 51:27.360]  I didn't take it. It's on Reddit.
[51:27.680 --> 51:28.320]  Oh, OK.
[51:28.320 --> 51:30.600]  I don't just have a toilet seat on a bed.
[51:30.940 --> 51:32.400]  He went into a women's bathroom.
[51:32.520 --> 51:33.520]  He took a toilet seat off.
[51:33.580 --> 51:34.480]  He put it on his stairs.
[51:34.580 --> 51:35.380]  He sent you the photo.
[51:35.620 --> 51:36.460]  What's the problem?
[51:36.880 --> 51:37.520]  You know what you could do?
[51:37.560 --> 51:39.660]  You could put a mirror behind that and you could shave in it.
[51:40.380 --> 51:41.120]  Oh, that's true.
[51:41.680 --> 51:42.980]  Shaving in a toilet reflection.
[51:43.540 --> 51:43.720]  Yeah.
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.800]  My outdoor mirror, by the way, completely useless now.
[51:46.920 --> 51:48.540]  Something happened over the winter.
[51:48.740 --> 51:49.900]  It's just all fucked up.
[51:50.160 --> 51:51.380]  I can't even I can't even see myself.
[51:51.960 --> 51:53.460]  Really? What are you going to do?
[51:54.660 --> 51:55.900]  Break another mirror, maybe.
[51:56.520 --> 51:57.140]  Shave in the dark.
[51:57.760 --> 51:59.860]  You have to shave inside like a normal person.
[51:59.980 --> 52:00.520]  That's crazy.
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.820]  Maybe I can at least shave on FaceTime.
[52:03.100 --> 52:07.600]  You could you could go over to Chris's house and shave in the shed with him.
[52:07.740 --> 52:08.660]  I would do that.
[52:08.940 --> 52:10.180]  OK, never mind.
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.560]  Oh, shit, the shaving shed's on fire.
[52:17.960 --> 52:19.180]  Somebody call 911.
[52:19.860 --> 52:21.760]  It smells like fucking burnt hair.
[52:24.060 --> 52:25.980]  It instantly caught a blaze
[52:25.980 --> 52:28.960]  due to all the beard trimmings from multiple shaves.
[52:29.400 --> 52:31.200]  Well, I told you where the hair ended up, didn't I?
[52:31.920 --> 52:32.620]  I don't remember.
[52:32.780 --> 52:33.920]  A few birds took it, right?
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.480]  Yeah, the birds in my gutters stuffed my gutters with my own hair.
[52:39.780 --> 52:41.020]  I can't really teach you.
[52:41.800 --> 52:43.400]  It's keeping the birds nice and warm though.
[52:43.460 --> 52:44.740]  And the squirrels.
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.640]  Oh, man.
[52:46.280 --> 52:48.600]  Your gutters look like if you wore a v-neck T-shirt.
[52:50.220 --> 52:51.580]  It's all the hair sticking out the top.
[52:52.700 --> 52:54.220]  Yeah, it's like my roof's chest.
[52:54.920 --> 52:57.280]  Is have there been any as you buy?
[52:57.520 --> 52:58.860]  You're in the card game, Jeff.
[52:58.900 --> 53:01.360]  Are there any other collectibles you're into at the moment beyond cards?
[53:03.440 --> 53:03.920]  Yeah.
[53:04.820 --> 53:08.460]  What am I into besides cards right now?
[53:08.500 --> 53:09.100]  What have I been buying?
[53:09.160 --> 53:10.100]  I know I've been buying something.
[53:10.800 --> 53:11.920]  I'm curious if you would.
[53:12.760 --> 53:16.000]  So the Canucks are changing all of the seating in the arena.
[53:17.220 --> 53:19.160]  And they're also penny pinching.
[53:19.420 --> 53:20.980]  But thankfully, this is going to charity.
[53:20.980 --> 53:25.380]  But they're offering season ticket holders the ability to buy their old seat
[53:25.380 --> 53:26.460]  for $50.
[53:26.960 --> 53:29.240]  Would you buy a shitty stadium seat?
[53:29.440 --> 53:31.740]  What? For $50? That's a steal.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.020]  It's practically free.
[53:33.120 --> 53:34.180]  A hundred percent, I would.
[53:34.200 --> 53:37.500]  If I was if I was a season ticket holder
[53:37.500 --> 53:41.180]  and my seat was going on sale and it was 50 bucks, I would buy it.
[53:41.280 --> 53:41.960]  No hesitation.
[53:42.120 --> 53:45.280]  I'd buy it for 500 bucks, probably if it was my season ticket seat.
[53:45.400 --> 53:46.280]  Yeah. Yeah, probably will be.
[53:46.280 --> 53:47.680]  I think the shipping is.
[53:50.720 --> 53:53.840]  I guess baseballs and baseball bats, I'm kind of into right now.
[53:54.740 --> 53:58.040]  But fucking all of our wives sure collect stuff these days.
[53:58.060 --> 53:58.540]  Boo-boos.
[53:58.820 --> 53:59.460]  They're in the boo-boo.
[53:59.660 --> 54:01.000]  Holy shit.
[54:01.580 --> 54:02.720]  What is going on?
[54:03.060 --> 54:04.100]  I don't get that one at all.
[54:04.600 --> 54:08.780]  Dude, it's like sometimes the fucking the bat phone will ring
[54:08.780 --> 54:11.080]  and then suddenly Emily be like, I've got to go right now.
[54:11.220 --> 54:14.620]  And she's just out the door with one sandal on and a purse with shit
[54:14.620 --> 54:15.480]  spilling out of it.
[54:15.480 --> 54:19.920]  It just comes back two hours later with fucking three pink stuffed animals.
[54:21.860 --> 54:27.660]  This is the the saddest collectible thing I've seen of also the Canucks.
[54:27.760 --> 54:29.840]  Once again, try to make money however they can.
[54:30.640 --> 54:32.800]  Player worn shoes, 50 bucks.
[54:33.120 --> 54:40.980]  Oh, from old shoes that players have used and don't want anymore in a bucket.
[54:41.160 --> 54:43.300]  How can you sell used shoes?
[54:43.300 --> 54:44.360]  But you could.
[54:44.640 --> 54:45.840]  Like, here's the thing.
[54:45.960 --> 54:48.900]  If there was presentation to this, like they were in a box
[54:48.900 --> 54:51.200]  and it's signed by the player or whatever.
[54:51.680 --> 54:54.820]  That's that could be some kind of faux collector's item.
[54:55.240 --> 54:57.620]  That's a bucket of shoes.
[54:58.120 --> 54:59.780]  That's a bucket of shoes.
[55:00.220 --> 55:03.840]  Like I think we have from the break show an autographed John Starks
[55:03.840 --> 55:06.700]  like like a New York Knicks shoe.
[55:06.780 --> 55:09.040]  But the presentation is totally different.
[55:09.480 --> 55:09.860]  Yeah. Yes.
[55:10.520 --> 55:13.960]  It's also not clear what player owns what shoe like you.
[55:14.160 --> 55:14.860]  Yes, exactly.
[55:15.240 --> 55:17.020]  Like, it's just a disaster.
[55:17.140 --> 55:20.600]  It's clearly the equipment manager was going to throw all these away.
[55:20.680 --> 55:23.060]  And somebody is like, we could try to sell these $50.
[55:23.320 --> 55:25.200]  So it's like that's $300 for the shoes right there.
[55:25.260 --> 55:28.420]  You got to go by smell and shoe size, I guess, to figure out who they belong to.
[55:30.020 --> 55:31.740]  Yeah, usually when you buy stuff like that,
[55:31.960 --> 55:35.000]  it's not like you're rummaging for the other one through the
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.560]  through the rest of the things.
[55:36.720 --> 55:37.220]  Oh, yeah.
[55:37.220 --> 55:39.980]  Like if there's one, do they sell them in pairs?
[55:40.100 --> 55:41.320]  I wonder, like, are they tied?
[55:41.420 --> 55:42.120]  I have no idea.
[55:42.420 --> 55:46.540]  But $50 having to pay $100 if it's like 50 per shoe.
[55:46.860 --> 55:48.320]  Would you say they're tools of the trade?
[55:50.500 --> 55:52.080]  No, because they don't play in them.
[55:54.140 --> 55:55.560]  They don't play in a towel either.
[55:56.020 --> 55:57.580]  No, but they use it during the game.
[55:58.040 --> 55:58.560]  Oh, OK.
[55:58.640 --> 56:01.920]  At no point in the activity of the sport are they using shoes?
[56:02.740 --> 56:04.160]  Although that would be a great rule.
[56:04.220 --> 56:05.400]  That could be a sports improvement
[56:06.120 --> 56:10.940]  instead of like a power play, being one person has to go out and sit in the box.
[56:11.140 --> 56:13.840]  The team has to wear running shoes for two minutes.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.360]  They have to take the skates off and put on normal shoes.
[56:17.740 --> 56:18.600]  That would be fun.
[56:19.360 --> 56:20.380]  That would be a funny thing.
[56:20.460 --> 56:23.280]  You could hit like halfway through the game if somebody like,
[56:23.740 --> 56:27.200]  I don't know, hits a home run through a certain hole
[56:27.200 --> 56:28.920]  or you score a goal in a certain way in hockey.
[56:29.060 --> 56:31.500]  Everybody, the teams just have to swap shoes
[56:32.980 --> 56:35.520]  and you just have to play like in the other first baseman shoes.
[56:35.600 --> 56:36.400]  And he has to play in yours.
[56:36.720 --> 56:37.680]  That would be crazy.
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.640]  I don't think I would ever want to wear a used pair of shoes.
[56:45.300 --> 56:47.260]  Every pair of shoes you wear is a used pair of shoes.
[56:48.620 --> 56:49.420]  That's a good point.
[56:50.220 --> 56:52.120]  Didn't you get, because you got hand-me-down clothes,
[56:52.200 --> 56:53.420]  did you not get hand-me-down shoes?
[56:54.800 --> 56:56.640]  Can we? Well, let's correct the verbiage here.
[56:56.900 --> 56:58.060]  He didn't get hand-me-down anything.
[56:58.180 --> 56:59.580]  He got hand-me-up clothes.
[56:59.580 --> 57:01.300]  Yeah, and hand-me-up toys.
[57:02.120 --> 57:03.880]  My younger brother's stuff they didn't want.
[57:05.500 --> 57:06.860]  Did you ever get hand-me-up shoes?
[57:07.780 --> 57:08.580]  No, I don't think I ever got that.
[57:08.620 --> 57:10.440]  I don't think shoes are considered like...
[57:12.160 --> 57:13.600]  They're no different than clothes.
[57:14.760 --> 57:16.680]  They're a bit Ming in those shoes, aren't they?
[57:17.360 --> 57:18.940]  Yeah, they can be. That's for sure.
[57:19.740 --> 57:22.940]  But I feel like if it's within the family, it's the family Ming.
[57:23.240 --> 57:23.920]  So it's OK.
[57:25.140 --> 57:27.060]  Family Ming is Ming though, isn't it?
[57:27.060 --> 57:30.060]  It is, but it's OK to live in the family Ming.
[57:30.640 --> 57:32.780]  Yeah, but only my Ming is acceptable to me.
[57:33.060 --> 57:34.600]  You're specific to your Ming?
[57:38.320 --> 57:41.340]  Do you think that your Ming is better than other Ming's?
[57:41.420 --> 57:44.960]  Or is it just specific, like you're only comfortable in the Mingage of you?
[57:46.180 --> 57:50.500]  I just I think I can manage my own Mingage pretty well.
[57:50.660 --> 57:53.600]  Whose Ming would you be more OK with, your brother's or Dan's?
[57:54.920 --> 57:55.400]  Brother?
[57:56.660 --> 57:59.280]  Yeah, well, good choice, by the way.
[57:59.420 --> 58:01.760]  Yeah, I don't think Mingage...
[58:09.380 --> 58:11.880]  How many of those shoes did you buy, by the way, Andrew?
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.200]  Zero, but I'd buy them all if I could send them to Nick.
[58:16.300 --> 58:18.300]  No, he's the anti-shoe guy. Why would I do that?
[58:18.660 --> 58:21.000]  Yeah, that's like shoes are his kryptonite.
[58:21.640 --> 58:24.960]  Dude, we had Nick screaming, Nick loves MILFs the other day.
[58:25.400 --> 58:27.360]  Doing a 100% eat live stream.
[58:27.640 --> 58:28.800]  It was fucking crazy.
[58:29.720 --> 58:30.940]  Oh, is the MILFs leaked over?
[58:31.600 --> 58:32.540]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:32.540 --> 58:35.740]  He's just trying to get away from feet, so he's screaming about how he loves MILFs.
[58:38.180 --> 58:40.580]  I wonder if milfeet.com is available.
[58:40.840 --> 58:42.800]  Oh, Jesus. I'm not going to Google it.
[58:42.840 --> 58:44.620]  Go nuts. Wouldn't it be FILF?
[58:45.040 --> 58:46.840]  Oh, it's taken by GoDaddy.
[58:46.860 --> 58:48.100]  Oh, no. Yeah, sorry, it's unavailable.
[58:48.540 --> 58:52.020]  Now, are you saying milfeet, M-I-L-F-F-E-E-T?
[58:52.340 --> 58:53.860]  F-E-E-T, yeah. You gotta do one F.
[58:54.460 --> 58:57.180]  Like milfeet? Yeah, milfeet.
[58:58.360 --> 58:59.800]  What about milfeat?
[59:00.580 --> 59:02.460]  It's a different thing, I think. That's different.
[59:02.680 --> 59:04.740]  Sorry, milfeet is unavailable as well.
[59:05.180 --> 59:08.660]  Sorry, Nick. I don't think... Maybe we can get you at milfeet.store.
[59:10.620 --> 59:11.580]  Milfeet.feet.
[59:15.280 --> 59:17.900]  I wouldn't be bothered by mingage in the feet.
[59:18.480 --> 59:19.520]  What do you mean? I would.
[59:20.100 --> 59:21.020]  Doesn't bother me.
[59:22.020 --> 59:22.820]  The feet...
[59:22.820 --> 59:25.500]  Yeah, but my feet... My feet are never clean.
[59:25.760 --> 59:26.960]  I don't think feet are ever clean.
[59:27.460 --> 59:30.000]  But you can get athlete's foot from somebody else.
[59:30.200 --> 59:31.640]  That's, you know, a great point.
[59:31.700 --> 59:32.840]  I'm immediately on your side.
[59:32.940 --> 59:34.480]  That was really quick. You're right.
[59:35.560 --> 59:36.680]  Yeah, you don't want that.
[59:37.140 --> 59:38.920]  Yeah, that's a fair point.
[59:39.120 --> 59:40.160]  Why aren't your feet ever clean?
[59:40.580 --> 59:42.660]  Well, I mean, they are clean, but you know what I mean?
[59:42.680 --> 59:43.880]  Like, I feel like they're always dirty.
[59:44.620 --> 59:45.640]  They're walking around.
[59:46.100 --> 59:47.360]  Yeah, but... They're touching stuff.
[59:47.940 --> 59:48.440]  Are you bad foot?
[59:49.140 --> 59:50.080]  Oh, yeah, all the time.
[59:50.080 --> 59:51.560]  Oh, that's that's that's your problem.
[59:51.860 --> 59:52.900]  I don't like socks.
[59:54.060 --> 59:55.400]  They're the pants of the foot.
[59:56.600 --> 59:58.000]  Yeah, they are!
[59:58.340 --> 59:59.000]  They're restrictive.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.720]  Need to let him breathe, as Nick says.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.700]  He likes to spread his toes out.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.060]  He's breathing through dirt, though, if you're barefoot.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.740]  I'm breathing through dirt.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.180]  Nick, is this a...
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.360]  Is this conversation getting you all hot and bothered?
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.760]  Or is that just the food?
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.640]  No, that's just the hot dogs.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:17.960]  Yeah, that's just the hot dogs.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.500]  Yeah, it's just the hot dogs.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.200]  Nick, are you worried that you're running out of time to wear the mask?
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.520]  Oh, what is it, May?
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:27.840]  Yeah. No.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.480]  OK, now I will say the way he said, oh, makes me think that it's something
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.460]  that he totally forgot.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.580]  Yeah, which is good, because a lot of people thought he was wearing it
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.340]  in episode 53, I believe.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.100]  But the rule is I have to reveal it at the end of the episode.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.120]  Yeah. Yes, it's true.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:41.980]  That's true.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.700]  I need to get it from the other office.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.760]  We're safe! Like I said.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.980]  This comes out in June, so the second watch is coming to an end.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.700]  Who had the second watch?
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.780]  Hmm. Let's say it was me.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.860]  I think I'm doing the fall and who had...
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.400]  Who's the last line?
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.980]  Was it you, Andrew?
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.680]  Were you the last line?
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.760]  Maybe. Do we share?
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:08.760]  It's one bullet, right?
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.620]  We share one bullet.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.480]  Yeah, I believe that's correct.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.580]  Yeah. OK.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.420]  I'll take the end.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:15.260]  OK.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.600]  It never gets to me.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.720]  Well, wait, we we each have a bullet, don't we?
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.520]  No, I tried to pitch that we each get a bullet.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.340]  And I was told, no, the game's only fun when you get one bullet.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.400]  But but the watch is when you are more heightened
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.780]  in trying to... It's your responsibility.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.780]  Yeah, it's your responsibility.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:36.200]  Now, we are getting close to time, which means we do need to start wrapping up.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.380]  However, something we have not talked about is that Gavin has been live
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.240]  on our Discord this entire time with a game that doesn't exist
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.940]  on his Xbox to see if it will load.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.320]  And so far, it will not.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.120]  Oh, right. Let me see.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.200]  So how did you uncover that you have a game that what do you mean?
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.620]  I got I got like an empty game.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.840]  Oops. Oh, well, that's it looks like 3D Ultra Mini Golf to me.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.600]  But see this empty. Oh.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.300]  Empty game.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.480]  What was the last thing you played?
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.320]  3D Ultra Mini Golf.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.840]  Before that, see, you see what happened here?
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.640]  I mean, like he knew he knew what you were.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.440]  So you loaded in Hitman and then you loaded in 3D Ultra
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.760]  and there's some fictional thing in the middle.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.180]  Yeah. And it's a shortcut to the queue.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:20.760]  Ha!
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.300]  Weird.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.660]  Yeah, but then when you go to like, yeah, when you press start on it,
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.300]  show him that because this is weird.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.280]  Take me to the game cart.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.420]  I should record this, shouldn't I, for the.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.560]  I'm kind of late now.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:36.920]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.520]  So it takes me to the queue.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.680]  Yeah, but what about the game cart?
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:40.900]  I'll go back.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:41.780]  And then.
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.220]  Oh!
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.480]  Okay, so it's just like a bug related to that.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.560]  And you fix that immediately.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.220]  We just watched him earlier go to manage.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.920]  Yeah, I went to manage and it took me to this empty.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.020]  Yeah, I got mad.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.060]  And then and then we said, oh, we'll just leave it here
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.320]  and maybe it'll find it eventually, like while we're doing this episode.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.780]  Hit install and see what happens.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.460]  It's the expansion. It's the DLC.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.320]  That's what. It's the DLC.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.080]  Yeah.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.860]  Yeah, that's what it says on this.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.220]  No.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:11.380]  Okay.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.360]  Doesn't appear that way for me, but I already had it installed.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.060]  So I got my shortcut to a 15 year old DLC.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.800]  Yeah, that you couldn't buy through the game.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.420]  Pin it! Pin it to your front page.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.220]  Yeah, just in case you want to use it later.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.240]  What a video that turned out to be, huh?
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.620]  We only did half also.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.680]  The DLC that we downloaded for 3D Ultra Mini Golf that I don't think we ever played over at Achievement Hunter.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.740]  At least if we did, I don't remember it, but I'm sure some sleuth will tell me I played it 18 times.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:47.200]  It has this cool new bug in it where sometimes the other people's balls will just become invisible.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.660]  And so you don't know where they are and you just have to hope you don't hit it.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.320]  And you always hit it.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.500]  Boy, you always do.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:55.840]  Every fucking time.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.700]  Super frustrating. Super frustrating.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:06.520]  Speaking of not remembering stuff, it's been a while now since it came out, but Geoff and I went back to Achievement City to do a little tour of our old builds.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.540]  And I'm embarrassed at how little I remember of them.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.620]  I kind of remember the games, but the names of them.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:13.600]  Jesus.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.760]  I think I found like three The Pits while we were walking around.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.020]  People were like, how can they not remember that stuff?
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.440]  By the way, that video got 400,000 views in four days.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.000]  That's pretty cool.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.940]  Thank you so much for watching it.
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:32.420]  I saw somebody, I'll paraphrase what I saw somebody say on a YouTube comment, which was like,
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.660]  I'm listening to them not remember what Cloud Down is when it's standing right in front of them.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.300]  Makes my heart hurt as it was such an important video to me when I was a kid.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.580]  But then I realized, you know, to them, that was just a Tuesday.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.740]  And that's really kind of like, at the end of the day, we were cranking them out so fast.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.720]  And we were building them. I never watched most of those videos.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.640]  I probably watched like the first 15 as we were finding the tone and the voice.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:01.060]  But once we had it, Gavin was editing them. I didn't need to watch it. I was in it.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.720]  I used to export them and play them for the room and anyone who wanted to watch the whole thing could.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.320]  But then we ended up just filming so much that we never did that again.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:12.400]  So the ones that I edited, I have a much better memory of.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:17.660]  But as soon as I handed it off, oh, horrific. I'm so embarrassed.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:20.260]  When does it cut off for the builds?
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.360]  It probably cuts off after like King Gavin, maybe.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.360]  Where is that in like the timeline of a build?
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.280]  I could look at what episode number that was.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.940]  I'd say Gavin and I built probably the first 200 episodes.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.860]  We really peeled off after that.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.120]  I built some stuff in Achievement City. I imagine it was post that.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.020]  Probably, yeah. You were building stuff with Matt and Jeremy probably.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.400]  Which, by the way, way better builders than us.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.880]  I think it was around... one of us made the joke in the video that we ran out of ideas around episode 100 or 200.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.660]  And people were like, but you made another 300 videos. What are you talking about?
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:00.620]  No, of course we did. We just ran out of ideas for our own little minigames.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.900]  After you make 150 of them, the well gets pretty dry.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:12.700]  And it was the kind of thing where it's like, you know, we'd spend an hour or two filming and then I would spend a day or two editing.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.520]  And then it literally was, we're done with that, it's on to the next thing.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.100]  And we never watched them after that.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:25.100]  But, yeah, so it's not like it was just any other Tuesday. It was a great Tuesday.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.020]  But then there were tons of other Tuesdays.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.120]  Yeah, I mean, there was a Tuesday every week.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:33.140]  It's kind of like when I worked on the weekly newspaper in the army.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.880]  You put the paper to bed on Wednesday.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:42.660]  You spend Thursday to the next Wednesday caring only about those 15 pages out of anything else in the world.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.040]  It's the most important thing in the world to you.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.680]  And you put everything you have into it.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:51.240]  And then you put it out and then you erase that from your memory because you got to start over again with the next 15 pages.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.900]  And there's no room in your head for the past 15 pages, you know.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.500]  The worry just switches to, man, I hope the next thing we're doing works.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.840]  Yeah, it's like, I got to figure out how to do this kind of circuit.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:01.680]  God damn it.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:08.320]  Hearing how emotional people got, though, and how much it meant to them was really surprising to me.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:14.840]  It was incredible to see what it meant to other people in relation to the past.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.480]  And then people being like, oh, I was 10 when I watched these.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.480]  It's like, God.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.860]  So it's not like we didn't give a shit about the builds.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.060]  It was just one after another.
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:28.640]  So chances are you may have watched it for longer than we spent making it.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:29.300]  Yeah.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.460]  And I think that's why we don't remember all of it.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.840]  If you watched the video twice, you probably remember it better than I do.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.500]  Because I made it and acted in it once.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.500]  And then, you know, we were on to the next thing.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.340]  And we were trying to figure out how to kill chickens or whatever.
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.740]  That was definitely a sentiment I had when I was building stuff in it, is knowing how important it was to people.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:56.780]  And that being a constant thing of like, they're probably never going to look at this structure from this angle.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.280]  But it needs to be built in case they do.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.600]  Because this is such an important thing to people.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.160]  Like, it should look good.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.300]  And it was funny being in a position of working on that, but then not being in the content.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:12.120]  And there were times where something would go wrong.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.320]  And I would feel like maybe we'd be thrown under the bus a little bit.
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.340]  In a way that wasn't necessarily reflective of what happened.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:24.980]  But then there were other times where I'd be like, oh yeah, oh boy, did I fuck that up.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:25.820]  Whoops.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.880]  I think it was a version of clouds that we did.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.380]  That we built it all.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.380]  And then we were just randomly knocking out blocks.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840]  To make it difficult.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.860]  And I'd run the course, and I'd done it a few times.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.480]  And I thought like, oh, this is way too easy.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.640]  This jump is, I should make this harder.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.800]  I'm going to knock this block out.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.900]  But then I never ran the course again, and it made that side, I think, impossible.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.800]  And it didn't get confronted again until the video.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.600]  And just me thinking, oh no, I did that.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.540]  I totally did that.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.840]  Oh, I fucked it.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.100]  It would be funny to find those clips of like, yeah, this one's deserved.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.820]  And then be like, oh no, this one's bullshit.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:04.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.960]  Most of them were probably bullshit.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.380]  It was just us trying to be funny.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.420]  There was one, a very brief story, because I know we've got to wrap up on this.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.620]  Where we had to do a build that was under so much crunch.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.440]  Because the schedule got flipped around.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.720]  And it had to be done at a time that wasn't anticipated.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.260]  And it was so much work.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.480]  And I was trying to secure the map.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.020]  In a way that you guys couldn't just break through and leave the area.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.420]  And I did like 98% of it.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.280]  And I left a small area open.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.840]  And Gavin, of course, just naturally goes to that area.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.580]  And he gets out, and he does the thing that I spent over an hour trying to prevent against.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.760]  Just in...
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.720]  But I didn't know, right?
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.700]  No, you had no clue.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.600]  You just decided you wanted to fuck off and go do something else.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:56.880]  And you happened to find the one wall that had a small gap in it.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.580]  Like, it was just a complete coincidence.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.940]  You had no idea how absurd it was that you had failed what you did.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.780]  You're just like, I'm going through here. Okay, I'm out now. Now I can just do what I want.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.040]  Yeah, it's like if you throw like a hundred cockroaches into a box, one of them will find its way out.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.520]  Yeah, you were the one.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.440]  It was such a big part of when we were making builds.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.820]  First, you'd come up with the idea, and then you would make it.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.220]  And then you'd be like, alright, how do we make it work? And then you get it to work.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.720]  And then you make sure it doesn't break every other time you use it, and you try to get it to work well.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:30.860]  And then you go, okay, now how are the other four or five assholes going to try to destroy this and ruin it for us?
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.360]  And then you gotta work around that, and it's like, ugh.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  We had a lot of, like, contingency chests.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.380]  Because we would be building stuff, and then be like, well, Michael's probably gonna die and lose all this shit.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.880]  So let's bury a chest with all of the replacements in it, so we're ready to go.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.800]  There was probably so much secret stuff like that in that world that nobody ever saw.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.960]  That was just, like, tools for, like, in case of emergency, you know, break block kind of stuff.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:04.960]  And because my memory of that stuff is all so bad now, there's no one on Earth who knows where or what everything is.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.760]  No. No.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.100]  It was funny, actually. I quickly watched another-
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.960]  Because we made that video, the algorithm changed to, like, old stuff we made.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:20.160]  And, uh, I guess we did the Tower of Jeff pretty early on, which was Jeff went and hit the Tower of Pimps.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.140]  And you hit it in some lava on the corner.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.180]  That was the surprise motherfucker, wasn't it?
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.220]  Yeah! Where Jack jumped me and fell in.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:32.760]  I didn't have any memory of the Tower of Gav, which was, like, over a hundred episodes later.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.140]  And it wasn't even like, oh, I can't remember where I've hidden it.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.260]  It'll be funny when I, like, when I see.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.500]  I was able to watch the whole video with absolutely no idea of what I was doing.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.960]  I'd hidden it up on, like, one of the doors.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.100]  And then I was like, oh my God, why'd I put it there?
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.620]  And then I put a bunch of traps and I was, like, chucking dynamite.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.140]  It was like watching someone else.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.220]  None of it came back to me when I saw it.
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:01.140]  I was just like, I can watch these now as though they're new to me.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.720]  It's crazy.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.280]  That is wild.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.020]  Well, we should probably wrap it up though, huh?
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.140]  We've been going over it a little bit.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.660]  The Achievement City stuff was really cool. People really responded to it.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.580]  And hopefully we can do some stuff for it.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.700]  We talked about just, sort of, kicking ideas around for doing stuff with maybe Falcons in the future.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.320]  That has to do with, like, Achievement City or whatever.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.460]  So stay tuned. We'll have, you know, I'm sure there's something out there for something.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.420]  Because people are very, very into it.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.380]  Very into it. So, we'll see.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.220]  Good to know.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.380]  Eric said that, but think low expectations there.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.200]  We're not making new Minecraft videos.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.860]  I'm talking about maybe doing something with the Falcons in the future.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.420]  So just, that's why you want to be on the Patreon.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:42.920]  That's the important part.

[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.600]  I will say, it was, uh...
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.560]  I was blown away by how nostalgic I felt for it.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.320]  And it was like, I think I might have said it in the video, but it made my heart smile.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.520]  It was really... Walking around it and trying to remember stuff, it was like...
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:07.860]  There was a very beautiful point in my life when Gavin and I were living together in the temporary house.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.620]  And we were spending all weekend laughing and drinking and playing Mario...
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.980]  Playing Minecraft, building these things.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:21.160]  And for, like, 45 minutes, we were on the same sofa in 2011 in that house again.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.920]  And that just felt like... I never thought I would feel that again.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.220]  It was fucking awesome.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.880]  And I think what surprised me was the audience felt the same.
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.040]  People were like, wow, I'm 15 again, I've just come home from school.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.780]  It was like, oh, it does it for everyone.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:37.240]  It was actually the closest thing to a time machine of, like, feelings.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:38.660]  Of vibe that I've ever felt.
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:45.480]  I've also, as much as I've spent my career in Halo and have worked with Red vs. Blue and all that...
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.560]  It was a different feeling going into that place.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.060]  It felt real and alive, in a way.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.660]  It was like visiting a real, like...
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:57.100]  I don't know. It was like going back to my high school.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.500]  It felt very intensely real.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.560]  In a way I didn't expect a video game to feel.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.500]  And I liked that it was an actual version, too.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.500]  It wasn't just a recreation that was very well done.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.680]  It was an actual snapshot.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.600]  To the point where we stumbled across a bunch of redstone switches on the ground.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.640]  And I guess Ray had put those down, like, 13 or 12 years earlier.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.860]  And the payoff to us finding them was in 2025.
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.840]  I just love that aspect of it.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.100]  We were just like, what's this?
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.000]  And I was like, I don't know.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.780]  And there's frogs now, apparently.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.300]  And there's frogs.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.080]  Alright, well, I guess that'll do it then.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.640]  Andrew's going to take us out.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.240]  He's got a very special message for you as we end the episode.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.280]  My special message is to make sure that you have yourself a wonderful day.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.740]  And thank you so much for listening to this episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.640]  I believe number 56? Is that right?
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.520]  Curious if you also realize that Panama is a Van Halen song.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.520]  We all learned many things when on a journey.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.720]  Thank you so much for listening.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.600]  We'll be back next week or tomorrow if you watch our Let's Plays.

[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.640]  What the fuck?
