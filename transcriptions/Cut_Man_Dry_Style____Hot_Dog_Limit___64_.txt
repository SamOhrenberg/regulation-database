[00:00.000 --> 00:04.620]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[00:05.120 --> 00:11.500]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity, plus it's heated, and it just feels so good.
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.180]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[00:18.740 --> 00:23.920]  suddenly it seems quite practical. The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[00:24.280 --> 00:29.420]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats, it only feels extravagant.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.180]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey,
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.300]  and with me as always, Andrew Patton, Gavin Frey, Eric Bedore, Nick Schwartz. This is episode
[00:41.160 --> 00:45.100]  64. I thought it was 63, and I was going to say, well, that's seven times nine,
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.400]  but it's not 63, it's 64, and I don't know any multiplication tables for that one, so.
[00:50.860 --> 00:51.340]  Eight times eight.
[00:51.620 --> 00:52.020]  64.
[00:52.300 --> 00:52.560]  Yeah, it's eight squared.
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.920]  Eight times eight, 64. There you go.
[00:55.540 --> 00:59.500]  Which of those dudes' dicks did Imhotep take, do you think?
[01:00.520 --> 01:01.340]  Oh, interesting.
[01:01.340 --> 01:02.340]  All 64 of them.
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.700]  Everyone has 64 dicks. This podcast has a weird smear to it.
[01:09.180 --> 01:14.400]  It looks like there's gel on the screen, 64 style. All 64 games look like shit.
[01:15.640 --> 01:17.400]  Gel? There's gel on the screen?
[01:17.580 --> 01:19.020]  Didn't know where he was going with that.
[01:19.040 --> 01:22.120]  It looked like it was covered, like the screen looked kind of like fuzzy,
[01:22.360 --> 01:25.200]  you know, like a weird way, like somebody smeared something on the screen.
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.580]  Like Vaseline on the lens?
[01:26.780 --> 01:28.460]  Sure, some Vaseline on the lens.
[01:28.920 --> 01:29.400]  There you go.
[01:29.400 --> 01:30.420]  It's an ugly.
[01:30.700 --> 01:31.900]  Daytime TV style.
[01:32.620 --> 01:33.420]  What a strange walk.
[01:33.660 --> 01:36.080]  We just went on a straight, what a strange walk that Gavin started,
[01:36.200 --> 01:38.920]  and then Andrew just sort of grabbed and he went, and we're going this way now.
[01:39.820 --> 01:43.300]  Screamer, Scream 4, also heavily Vaseline for some reason.
[01:44.020 --> 01:44.680]  Scream 4?
[01:45.220 --> 01:46.720]  Yeah, it just looks like shit.
[01:47.300 --> 01:49.540]  Did you just watch Scream 4?
[01:50.040 --> 01:52.740]  No, just remembered it being very Vaseline-y.
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.780]  Really? Well, that one, they're like using weird cameras, aren't they?
[01:56.780 --> 02:00.260]  They're doing like shoulder cam and like webcam stuff in it.
[02:00.900 --> 02:01.440]  Vaseline cam.
[02:01.880 --> 02:06.360]  If you want to see some of the best Vaseline work in the history of Hollywood,
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.720]  let me recommend season seven of the TV show Dallas.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.340]  That was when I think everybody was too old and alcoholic and bloated to fake it anymore.
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.440]  And they were like, we just got to slather on the petroleum jelly because it is getting
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.400]  obvious that these people are aging faster than our story wants the audience to believe.
[02:26.780 --> 02:30.060]  You ever just smear a big thing of Vaseline over your face?
[02:30.740 --> 02:31.100]  No.
[02:31.200 --> 02:32.100]  Your eyebrow or something?
[02:32.300 --> 02:33.000]  Yeah, I'm wearing it right now.
[02:33.580 --> 02:36.340]  Oh, that's nice. I just, I see it all the time in fights.
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.620]  Like cut men are always smeared in Vaseline on faces.
[02:39.800 --> 02:41.060]  And I always wonder what that feels like.
[02:41.160 --> 02:44.520]  Is that just straight up Vaseline or is it some sort of like homebrew mix?
[02:44.920 --> 02:46.360]  No, I'm pretty sure it's just Vaseline.
[02:46.880 --> 02:47.980]  It's just Vaseline.
[02:48.220 --> 02:50.680]  It's just trying to hold the cut.
[02:51.060 --> 02:53.120]  Yeah, it's just to prevent friction.
[02:53.120 --> 02:57.640]  Like when you get hit and hopefully you're hopefully getting the boxing glove to slide
[02:57.640 --> 03:00.700]  right off of your eyebrow that just got hit so, so hard.
[03:00.960 --> 03:03.840]  What if you pre-Vaseline then? What if you just pre...
[03:03.840 --> 03:05.980]  That's illegal. Not allowed to do that.
[03:07.140 --> 03:12.720]  But that is a thing that people will do is they'll like coat themselves in Vaseline or lotion
[03:13.300 --> 03:18.660]  prior to the fight so their body absorbs it and then they sweat it out and become super slippery.
[03:19.200 --> 03:23.040]  We should rent one of those punch glove machines to see who has the hardest punch.
[03:23.120 --> 03:27.760]  All take a go punching it and then we Vaseline it and have another go.
[03:28.640 --> 03:31.720]  Then we go to the minor emergency when somebody breaks a knuckle.
[03:32.140 --> 03:33.660]  Can I ask you guys a question about Vaseline?
[03:34.080 --> 03:34.540]  Of course.
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.740]  Well, let me ask you two questions. One, is Vaseline the brand or the product?
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.080]  It's petroleum jelly, right? Is Vaseline just the company or the product?
[03:43.160 --> 03:43.620]  I think it's the brand.
[03:44.840 --> 03:47.380]  It's like Kleenex, right? Like tissue.
[03:47.520 --> 03:48.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:48.180 --> 03:49.180]  Facial tissue or whatever.
[03:49.680 --> 03:53.860]  It's just become synonymous with the product.
[03:54.500 --> 03:57.100]  The other question is, when I was a kid growing up,
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.080]  everybody always talked about like it was always like you jerk off with Vaseline.
[04:00.360 --> 04:03.980]  I've never done that. That seems like such a mess.
[04:04.540 --> 04:05.920]  I guess we got to try it on the show, man.
[04:07.240 --> 04:09.440]  I don't want to jerk off on the show.
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.260]  It's all you circumcised freaks who need that lube.
[04:16.440 --> 04:16.860]  What?
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.120]  That's just lobbing her grenade and four guys watching it land.
[04:23.500 --> 04:26.500]  It's all your circumcised... I was just trying to understand.
[04:26.640 --> 04:27.420]  OK, sorry. Go ahead.
[04:27.500 --> 04:30.540]  If you're munking off, you can't just munk off dry.
[04:31.300 --> 04:31.780]  I mean, sure.
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.040]  Yeah, but I think that the idea is that munking off dry is probably not as
[04:38.240 --> 04:42.120]  fun or as similar to the experience of having intercourse,
[04:42.300 --> 04:46.660]  you know, where it's typically not dry skin rubbing against dry skin.
[04:46.860 --> 04:50.460]  I think it's like a dry rub. Yeah, it's like a brisket.
[04:50.720 --> 04:53.600]  Yeah, but that's what the foreskin is for, like easing it in and out.
[04:54.420 --> 04:57.680]  I'm just imagining a bunch of monks eating brisket and you bringing
[04:57.680 --> 05:00.060]  foreskin in really is throwing up my visual.
[05:01.260 --> 05:06.080]  I thought title. I'm so excited to write this title. Cut man dry style.
[05:09.740 --> 05:13.400]  I don't know. I just think I think circumcision was a bad idea.
[05:14.080 --> 05:14.880]  Take it up with God.
[05:14.980 --> 05:16.040]  I don't think that's controversial.
[05:16.040 --> 05:18.780]  Yeah, I don't think there's anything controversial about that either.
[05:18.920 --> 05:21.420]  I think circumcision is on its way out culturally.
[05:22.180 --> 05:26.260]  But for many of us who were born at a time when it wasn't,
[05:26.960 --> 05:28.040]  we just dealing with it.
[05:28.180 --> 05:31.100]  You know, I've been short in circumcision for years.
[05:31.120 --> 05:32.320]  I'm ready for the collapse.
[05:32.680 --> 05:36.280]  I'm calling on the Michael Burry of circumcision.
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.740]  Yeah, he shortened GameStop and circumcision.
[05:38.900 --> 05:40.300]  Anything now is going to be fucking loaded.
[05:40.420 --> 05:41.380]  Oh, big money.
[05:41.860 --> 05:43.240]  Diamond hands. Let's go.
[05:46.220 --> 05:51.660]  If the circumcised of the regulation crew could buy back a foreskin,
[05:51.780 --> 05:52.880]  how much would you put down for it?
[05:53.460 --> 05:53.900]  Zero.
[05:54.420 --> 05:55.140]  You wouldn't want one?
[05:55.680 --> 05:56.100]  No.
[05:57.940 --> 06:01.640]  I've made it 50 fucking years with a bald dome, dude.
[06:01.720 --> 06:02.840]  I'm pretty. I'm doing okay.
[06:04.020 --> 06:06.240]  I guess I don't need to put a hat on it.
[06:06.700 --> 06:07.620]  Not this late in the game.
[06:08.300 --> 06:11.120]  Let's say you could get injections and you could regrow it.
[06:11.800 --> 06:13.240]  You wouldn't consider it.
[06:13.240 --> 06:17.700]  Okay, there is. I've heard this on the Howard Stern show in the past.
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.760]  There is a procedure you can do where they stretch.
[06:20.940 --> 06:23.880]  If you have enough skin, they can stretch it and pull it and kind of recreate.
[06:24.200 --> 06:24.780]  Oh, God.
[06:25.280 --> 06:29.220]  Recreate your foreskin. And it sounds brutal.
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.540]  I will say one time I heard it was during that segment.
[06:34.800 --> 06:40.880]  Some guy called in the Howard Stern show and said that he got his foreskin cut off as an adult.
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.760]  Like he had a foreskin his entire life.
[06:43.860 --> 06:46.600]  And then like had a wife or a girlfriend or somebody who was not into it.
[06:46.620 --> 06:47.780]  And he was like, fuck it, I'll just cut it off.
[06:47.880 --> 06:51.280]  And he cut it off and said his life got so much better instantly.
[06:51.760 --> 06:52.560]  Sex felt better.
[06:52.880 --> 06:54.000]  It was easier to clean.
[06:54.180 --> 06:55.300]  Going to the bathroom was easier.
[06:55.400 --> 06:58.120]  And he was like, I would never in a million years take a foreskin again.
[06:58.400 --> 07:02.180]  And I'm going to trust that one stranger on a radio show
[07:02.180 --> 07:07.080]  who I don't know and who could have been lying because it makes me feel better about my situation.
[07:07.180 --> 07:09.760]  That guy was a plant for a big sucker.
[07:09.760 --> 07:10.860]  For big foreskin.
[07:11.080 --> 07:13.980]  Big circumcision is a reverse.
[07:14.460 --> 07:15.220]  Big cut.
[07:15.960 --> 07:16.720]  Big cut.
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.640]  I don't want to hear that propaganda while I'm shorting.
[07:21.120 --> 07:21.780]  I don't know, man.
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.600]  Life's pretty easy without a foreskin.
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.320]  Life's pretty easy with a foreskin.
[07:26.760 --> 07:27.220]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[07:27.380 --> 07:29.560]  And it just, there's no friction.
[07:30.340 --> 07:33.440]  Yeah, but if you've made it this far in life, why would you need to change it?
[07:34.460 --> 07:37.080]  I think sometimes, you know, you want to try a new pair of shoes.
[07:37.600 --> 07:39.980]  Okay, well, why don't you cut your foreskin off and then let us know.
[07:40.580 --> 07:41.120]  That's too permanent.
[07:41.260 --> 07:42.820]  That'd be easier than us adding a foreskin.
[07:43.040 --> 07:45.840]  It's way easier for you guys to subtract than for us to add.
[07:46.040 --> 07:48.940]  So if we want to get to the bottom of it, maybe that's the angle we take.
[07:49.180 --> 07:51.080]  I just want a fantasy world where you could, like,
[07:51.160 --> 07:53.400]  inject yourself with something and it naturally grows back.
[07:53.960 --> 07:54.460]  That'd be fun.
[07:55.640 --> 07:57.980]  I'll only cut mine off if it gets put on someone else.
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.620]  You know how, like, people are going to Turkey to get hair replacement done?
[08:02.720 --> 08:04.180]  Like, that's the place to get hair or whatever.
[08:04.180 --> 08:05.480]  Yeah, those big old turkey teeth.
[08:05.860 --> 08:06.220]  Yeah.
[08:06.220 --> 08:08.660]  Could you get, like, back hair replacement?
[08:08.860 --> 08:10.120]  Like, could you put hair anywhere?
[08:10.360 --> 08:12.500]  What's the restriction on where you can put hair?
[08:13.720 --> 08:17.500]  Oh, I mean, anywhere that was a follicle, right, could put a new one.
[08:17.580 --> 08:18.700]  I assume, right?
[08:19.420 --> 08:21.760]  It just, I've never heard anyone getting back hair.
[08:22.020 --> 08:25.520]  I don't know if we ever talked about it, but when I came back from Turkey,
[08:25.640 --> 08:26.900]  you know, I flew back from Turkey.
[08:27.280 --> 08:27.500]  Yeah.
[08:27.820 --> 08:33.340]  There were probably eight dudes on the plane who had had the surgery.
[08:33.340 --> 08:39.480]  They were all peppered around, and they just had red, angry heads
[08:39.860 --> 08:42.220]  with, like, little black hairs popping out.
[08:42.340 --> 08:46.440]  And their head just looked like a bruised testicle.
[08:46.980 --> 08:48.320]  It was just, it was brutal.
[08:48.520 --> 08:50.720]  And they just all looked so fucking miserable.
[08:50.900 --> 08:53.560]  But they all had bloody, hairy heads.
[08:53.920 --> 08:54.780]  So I guess it...
[08:54.780 --> 08:56.060]  They will look fine eventually, right?
[08:56.280 --> 08:59.200]  Yeah, I guess in six months from now, they'll probably be the happiest dudes on Earth.
[08:59.300 --> 09:00.680]  But man, they looked miserable on the plane.
[09:01.120 --> 09:01.960]  I'm going to have to do it one day.
[09:01.960 --> 09:04.320]  Yeah, yeah, that's what my flight looked like.
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.440]  Yeah, just a bunch of dudes.
[09:06.060 --> 09:06.460]  Yeah.
[09:07.140 --> 09:08.300]  Gavin, I'll go with you.
[09:08.480 --> 09:10.720]  Like, I don't necessarily, like, need it.
[09:10.800 --> 09:13.060]  But, like, I get, like, a lower hairline.
[09:13.140 --> 09:16.300]  Imagine if I came back and just had, like, a really forward hairline.
[09:18.100 --> 09:24.100]  Like, just dialing it back and just having it go, like, oh yeah, forward two inches.
[09:24.240 --> 09:25.820]  Like, it's, like, way down my forehead.
[09:26.140 --> 09:26.620]  That'd be cool.
[09:27.120 --> 09:29.340]  I got plenty on my back, plenty on my chest.
[09:29.340 --> 09:30.320]  I've got plenty.
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.360]  Like, even high up my cheeks.
[09:32.540 --> 09:35.480]  Like, my beard stops right under my eyes.
[09:36.860 --> 09:38.140]  It's just not where I need it.
[09:38.520 --> 09:41.360]  Do you think they could take any hair from anywhere and then put it on your head?
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.960]  Or does it have to be from, like, the back of your head?
[09:43.020 --> 09:44.120]  Like, it's, like, that kind of situation.
[09:44.940 --> 09:46.920]  You think you could give up, like, some back hair?
[09:47.620 --> 09:48.740]  Back of the neck, isn't it, usually?
[09:48.940 --> 09:54.300]  You could have a head that's partially, like, head hair, pubic hair, and back hair.
[09:54.780 --> 09:55.880]  You'd just be like, man.
[09:56.240 --> 09:57.560]  Oh, do you think you could get animal?
[09:59.040 --> 10:02.040]  Oh, like a lion, like, get, like, half a lion's mane?
[10:02.560 --> 10:06.000]  Oh, can you imagine seeing someone who had a head of hair from a sloth?
[10:06.160 --> 10:07.880]  Yeah, yeah, think about it.
[10:08.200 --> 10:08.500]  Yeah.
[10:08.780 --> 10:10.720]  Oh, you could have, you could have schmee hair.
[10:11.020 --> 10:12.540]  You could get a bunch of hair from your cat.
[10:13.720 --> 10:17.480]  And then, and then, and then you go home and you go, I'm like you, I'm like you.
[10:18.080 --> 10:19.300]  And then I'll get a hunger for flesh.
[10:20.840 --> 10:23.900]  I wonder what animal has the most human-like hair.
[10:24.400 --> 10:24.720]  Huh.
[10:26.420 --> 10:29.120]  I bet there's, like, a, like, a dog that has human hair.
[10:29.580 --> 10:31.100]  It, like, Nick's dog has people eyes.
[10:31.580 --> 10:32.080]  Oh, yeah.
[10:32.640 --> 10:34.740]  What about, what about feathers?
[10:35.460 --> 10:35.780]  Yeah.
[10:37.300 --> 10:40.000]  Saw a real fucked up looking bird recently, but I don't know what it was.
[10:41.960 --> 10:44.860]  That would be great if you could just select from a list and be like,
[10:44.920 --> 10:45.900]  dude, I love your new hair.
[10:45.980 --> 10:46.480]  Where'd you get it?
[10:46.500 --> 10:47.660]  And like, oh, it's Golden Retriever.
[10:47.680 --> 10:49.020]  And they're like, yeah, it's fucking shows.
[10:49.180 --> 10:49.640]  It's beautiful.
[10:50.360 --> 10:51.020]  What about you?
[10:51.280 --> 10:52.500]  I went with German Shepherd.
[10:52.660 --> 10:53.180]  I like it.
[10:53.220 --> 10:53.660]  Yeah, it's good.
[10:53.900 --> 10:58.180]  What if you, instead of taxidermy for your favorite pet, you just get them on you?
[10:58.560 --> 11:00.040]  That sounds horrendous.
[11:00.780 --> 11:04.540]  Like, what if I just had, oh, I just grossed myself out.
[11:04.840 --> 11:06.480]  What if I had Smee on my back?
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.240]  Yeah, like I fill in my bald spot with a little bit of Henry.
[11:10.740 --> 11:11.220]  Yeah.
[11:13.020 --> 11:14.380]  Oh, I hate this idea.
[11:14.880 --> 11:15.280]  Why?
[11:15.860 --> 11:19.840]  The premise of, like, you're having to shave your animal for their hair.
[11:20.240 --> 11:21.140]  No, they've died.
[11:21.640 --> 11:24.900]  Well, when they die, they don't grow hair back.
[11:25.000 --> 11:25.920]  You're going to run out of hair.
[11:26.420 --> 11:28.080]  Well, you're taking the follicles, aren't you?
[11:28.120 --> 11:28.880]  The fur follicles.
[11:29.540 --> 11:29.700]  Yeah.
[11:30.140 --> 11:33.100]  But I assume that... do they not go away?
[11:33.320 --> 11:35.520]  I'm not just gluing hairballs to my back.
[11:36.680 --> 11:37.080]  Huh?
[11:38.580 --> 11:39.680]  Do they not go away?
[11:39.740 --> 11:40.060]  What do you mean?
[11:40.640 --> 11:42.720]  I assume that they would vanish over time.
[11:43.620 --> 11:44.920]  Oh, maybe you might have to get...
[11:44.920 --> 11:47.060]  I assume you need a refill, is my point.
[11:47.300 --> 11:50.840]  And your animal's going to die at some point.
[11:51.460 --> 11:54.600]  Yeah, I don't think I'd want to take its follicles before it died.
[11:55.480 --> 11:55.840]  Interesting.
[11:56.080 --> 11:59.160]  So you'd want to, like, wait for it to die naturally,
[11:59.280 --> 12:01.180]  and then immediately rush into the OR.
[12:01.460 --> 12:04.000]  Yeah, yeah. So it dies, and then I harvest.
[12:04.520 --> 12:05.860]  See, I see that this is the confusion.
[12:05.940 --> 12:08.420]  I was thinking more like a wig type scenario,
[12:08.460 --> 12:12.720]  where you're just shaving the hair and then shoving it in your own head,
[12:12.800 --> 12:14.940]  as opposed to you're talking about the follicle.
[12:15.380 --> 12:16.520]  I don't think when you go to Turkey,
[12:16.520 --> 12:19.280]  they just shave off some of your hair and plug it in.
[12:19.320 --> 12:20.560]  No, I don't think they do that in Turkey.
[12:20.560 --> 12:23.640]  But I think that's what hair transplant surgery originally was.
[12:23.940 --> 12:24.580]  Was it not?
[12:25.300 --> 12:26.140]  What, gluing hair?
[12:26.700 --> 12:28.800]  Not gluing hair, but, like, inserting hair.
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.360]  That's why you'd have to reset it, like, every few years or like...
[12:33.760 --> 12:34.460]  I don't know.
[12:34.540 --> 12:37.400]  I was always under the impression that you need the follicle put in.
[12:37.980 --> 12:38.520]  I don't know.
[12:39.100 --> 12:42.920]  I would go 100% bald before trying any of this.
[12:43.120 --> 12:43.540]  Yeah.
[12:43.680 --> 12:44.300]  In reality.
[12:44.940 --> 12:49.100]  I would just tattoo, like, a big spider web on my head and pretend I was tough.
[12:49.740 --> 12:50.580]  That's cool.
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.140]  I wonder if there's anyone who's bald who is considering going to Turkey,
[12:55.180 --> 12:59.100]  but is not because they don't want people to assume why they're going there.
[12:59.420 --> 13:01.180]  Like, they just want to visit Turkey.
[13:01.320 --> 13:03.480]  They don't want the transplant surgery, but they're bald,
[13:03.660 --> 13:05.880]  so they know everyone will assume that that's why they're going.
[13:06.220 --> 13:07.520]  And so they just haven't gone.
[13:08.080 --> 13:09.180]  They don't want to deal with that.
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.000]  That's why I tried to be very clear that I was going on a cruise that happened to end in Turkey.
[13:14.080 --> 13:16.920]  I was not going to Turkey because I didn't want anybody to think
[13:16.920 --> 13:19.960]  I was like trying to sneak back in with a new hairline.
[13:20.260 --> 13:21.480]  I don't think I've ever seen.
[13:21.720 --> 13:22.760]  I don't think there's any shame in it.
[13:23.020 --> 13:23.860]  No, no shame.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.200]  But I've never seen a result that I went, oh, that was worth it.
[13:27.740 --> 13:29.320]  I just don't think you've seen the best work.
[13:29.500 --> 13:30.340]  Oh, I don't know.
[13:30.460 --> 13:32.540]  Joel McHale is a pretty good example.
[13:32.920 --> 13:34.560]  You ever seen that dude before his hair transplant?
[13:35.360 --> 13:38.600]  I just don't like I think it's more of just a personal thing where it's like,
[13:38.640 --> 13:38.980]  I don't care.
[13:39.160 --> 13:40.020]  It doesn't matter.
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.980]  Look at Steve Carell's head in series one of The Office compared to series two.
[13:44.060 --> 13:44.420]  No kidding.
[13:44.700 --> 13:45.280]  No kidding.
[13:45.320 --> 13:45.760]  It's night and day.
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.840]  I don't know if they like sabotaged his hair for the first one, but wow.
[13:49.960 --> 13:50.900]  Joel McHale looks great.
[13:51.420 --> 13:52.380]  Yeah, he looks fantastic.
[13:52.500 --> 13:54.940]  He's an example of why you would get a hair transplant.
[13:55.260 --> 13:55.780]  It changed.
[13:55.940 --> 14:01.060]  It changed him from a nerdy dude to a good looking dude instantly.
[14:01.600 --> 14:07.000]  I guess when I've seen like TikToks of people being like, I went to Turkey and did the thing.
[14:07.260 --> 14:09.320]  Here's my month by month update.
[14:09.620 --> 14:10.640]  Yeah, what do you expect?
[14:11.620 --> 14:13.000]  Here's a Hollywood actor.
[14:13.380 --> 14:15.040]  I saw some TikToks.
[14:16.440 --> 14:18.300]  We're talking about the best work here, bud.
[14:18.940 --> 14:21.640]  I think Turkey is the best place to...
[14:21.640 --> 14:23.420]  I feel like Turkey's the number one place now.
[14:23.720 --> 14:25.440]  But I don't know what I'm talking about.
[14:25.960 --> 14:27.380]  I don't think any of us really do.
[14:28.580 --> 14:31.240]  I don't think any of us have researched this extensively.
[14:32.660 --> 14:33.420]  Zero research.
[14:33.920 --> 14:34.180]  Yes.
[14:34.500 --> 14:36.120]  I think people go to Turkey because it's cheap.
[14:36.480 --> 14:36.660]  Yeah.
[14:37.100 --> 14:38.500]  And I think they're good doctors there too.
[14:38.580 --> 14:41.860]  Let me just tell you, after being in Turkey, it's awesome.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.340]  I would go to Turkey for a lot of stuff because Turkey's just cool.
[14:44.340 --> 14:45.620]  And the people in Turkey are cool.
[14:45.880 --> 14:49.120]  And if you told me they had the best doctors in the world in Turkey,
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.140]  I'd go, I believe it.
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.300]  It's a pretty cool fucking town.
[14:51.400 --> 14:51.940]  It's a big city.
[14:52.040 --> 14:53.480]  I get it.
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.960]  I think Turkey's just rad.
[14:55.700 --> 14:56.000]  Yeah.
[14:56.340 --> 14:57.660]  I've heard nothing but good things.
[14:58.140 --> 14:58.900]  Mainly from you.
[14:59.360 --> 15:00.340]  But nothing but good things.
[15:02.620 --> 15:04.540]  Andrew, I need a mental image update.
[15:04.880 --> 15:05.580]  Still got the long hair?
[15:06.260 --> 15:07.280]  Yeah, it's too long.
[15:07.500 --> 15:07.960]  I need to get it.
[15:08.400 --> 15:09.160]  Still got the beard?
[15:09.780 --> 15:09.960]  Yeah.
[15:10.600 --> 15:12.080]  And how's the coverage on the head?
[15:12.120 --> 15:12.480]  Is it good?
[15:12.920 --> 15:13.340]  It's fine.
[15:13.840 --> 15:14.280]  Okay.
[15:14.700 --> 15:17.200]  Would you be going, if you went for some plugs,
[15:17.260 --> 15:20.200]  would they be on the top or sort of on the receding line?
[15:22.200 --> 15:23.840]  I guess top, right?
[15:24.120 --> 15:24.700]  You want top?
[15:25.340 --> 15:26.880]  Yeah, I think that's where I would need it.
[15:27.440 --> 15:27.660]  Yeah.
[15:27.780 --> 15:31.620]  Yeah, like in the male pattern baldness section would be at the crown, probably.
[15:32.000 --> 15:32.600]  Oh, the crown.
[15:32.680 --> 15:33.920]  That's a good way to say it.
[15:34.080 --> 15:36.200]  I would definitely need a hairline.
[15:36.660 --> 15:39.880]  Like, my hairline has definitely receded over the years.
[15:40.880 --> 15:41.760]  It's retreating.
[15:41.760 --> 15:43.500]  Bunch of cowards.
[15:44.040 --> 15:45.080]  Okay, hold the line.
[15:45.560 --> 15:46.480]  It's like, hold the line!
[15:46.640 --> 15:47.040]  Hold the line!
[15:47.080 --> 15:47.740]  We can win this!
[15:47.920 --> 15:50.720]  And it's like, no, we don't have enough reinforcements.
[15:50.860 --> 15:52.540]  The war's already lost!
[15:54.520 --> 15:55.480]  Pack it in, boys.
[15:56.420 --> 15:57.980]  I would get a beard.
[15:58.220 --> 15:59.400]  Do you think they'd let me do beard?
[16:00.980 --> 16:02.280]  Get like beard hair transplant?
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.880]  What about like grizzly bear beard?
[16:04.200 --> 16:05.480]  I think that would be, that'd be great.
[16:05.480 --> 16:08.360]  I mean, I just can't, I can't grow a beard like at all.
[16:08.500 --> 16:11.560]  So I'm just like, can you do hair transplant on face?
[16:11.760 --> 16:12.880]  I don't know.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.560]  I would assume so, right?
[16:14.920 --> 16:18.640]  I mean, I bet just some hormones would kick a good beard out.
[16:19.160 --> 16:19.280]  Yeah.
[16:19.300 --> 16:22.160]  Oh, what if I started doing like, uh, steroids?
[16:22.960 --> 16:23.900]  Yeah, or something.
[16:24.060 --> 16:24.180]  Yeah.
[16:24.620 --> 16:27.460]  What kind of beard did Jose Canseco grow?
[16:28.640 --> 16:29.120]  Big.
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.000]  Big until none at all.
[16:31.300 --> 16:33.520]  If you could safely do steroids, would you do steroids?
[16:34.920 --> 16:35.820]  For what?
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.460]  What do you mean?
[16:38.580 --> 16:40.460]  For its, for its purpose.
[16:40.460 --> 16:42.020]  To get like yoked?
[16:42.600 --> 16:42.980]  Yeah, why not?
[16:43.060 --> 16:43.840]  I mean, it helps with that.
[16:43.920 --> 16:44.840]  It helps with recovery.
[16:45.400 --> 16:45.540]  Yeah.
[16:45.600 --> 16:46.540]  You still have to do shit.
[16:47.220 --> 16:52.600]  I think I'd rather just like put an EPO tent on my bed and just sleep in an EPO tent.
[16:53.020 --> 16:54.400]  An EPO tent?
[16:55.160 --> 16:58.980]  Yeah, like it raises your your blood levels or something.
[16:59.100 --> 17:00.740]  It's what Lance Armstrong was doing.
[17:01.440 --> 17:02.500]  He was also doing steroids.
[17:02.940 --> 17:04.100]  Lance Armstrong was also doing a little bit more than he needs.
[17:04.100 --> 17:08.000]  I know, he was doing a lot of, I mean, Lance Armstrong was doing a lot, but like doing a
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.560]  tent to raise your EPO, I believe is what it is.
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.120]  That was so disappointing because he had the coolest commercial in the history of sports
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.820]  commercials where it was like him training and he was like, people keep asking me, what are you on?
[17:19.920 --> 17:22.200]  And he's like, I'm on my bike eight hours a day.
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.340]  And I was like, oh, it's tough.
[17:23.580 --> 17:25.660]  And he's like, but also I'm on a shitload of steroids.
[17:25.760 --> 17:26.560]  They just haven't caught me yet.
[17:26.840 --> 17:28.700]  Yeah, I'm just doing like a bunch of trend also.
[17:28.920 --> 17:30.120]  So, you know, figure it out.
[17:30.700 --> 17:31.820]  And an EPO tent.
[17:32.580 --> 17:33.240]  What am I on?
[17:33.280 --> 17:35.880]  I'm on my bike eight hours a day and I'm on a flight to Turkey.
[17:38.620 --> 17:40.760]  I just don't think I'd have.
[17:41.620 --> 17:42.800]  Oh, maybe I don't know.
[17:43.480 --> 17:46.600]  I guess I don't think I'd use steroids to get jacked.
[17:46.620 --> 17:48.340]  It would just be more like injury recovery.
[17:49.080 --> 17:50.000]  How much are you getting injured?
[17:50.340 --> 17:51.940]  What's your percent right now for ankles?
[17:52.520 --> 17:54.240]  Oh, 100% ankles are all good.
[17:54.980 --> 17:56.120]  My shoulders fucked.
[17:56.320 --> 18:00.580]  But so you wouldn't see it as like a like you would use you wouldn't see it as steroids
[18:00.580 --> 18:02.960]  being like a consistent thing.
[18:02.960 --> 18:09.380]  You would only use them to recover from stepping on a sushi container or whatever.
[18:09.540 --> 18:09.940]  Yes.
[18:10.000 --> 18:10.320]  Yeah.
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.800]  And we're in a we're talking in a world where like there's no negatives to steroid usage.
[18:15.060 --> 18:20.200]  Well, you know, one of the positives to steroid usage, I think that I wasn't always a positive,
[18:20.260 --> 18:23.480]  but now later in life, I wouldn't mind is I doesn't shrink your balls.
[18:23.720 --> 18:28.800]  I could use the older I get, the more they sag, you know, like I could use a little ball shrinkage
[18:28.800 --> 18:29.500]  at 50.
[18:29.680 --> 18:30.700]  You got long balls.
[18:31.140 --> 18:32.020]  I got long balls.
[18:32.020 --> 18:33.160]  I didn't think it'd bring them in.
[18:33.220 --> 18:34.160]  It would just make him little.
[18:34.640 --> 18:36.660]  Yeah, but then maybe they wouldn't swing as much, you know?
[18:39.240 --> 18:40.720]  The pendulum would be smaller.
[18:41.900 --> 18:43.020]  Andrew, how'd you hurt your shoulder?
[18:43.120 --> 18:44.000]  Was it a sleeping injury?
[18:44.660 --> 18:47.460]  I've had a fucked up shoulder for like 15 years.
[18:47.760 --> 18:50.600]  I think I have like a rotator cuff injury.
[18:51.880 --> 18:53.280]  Well, definitely take steroids.
[18:55.020 --> 18:57.400]  Yeah, I think I might need surgery on it or something.
[18:57.460 --> 18:57.820]  I don't know.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.440]  I guess it doesn't if it's a rotator cuff, you know, it doesn't naturally heal.
[19:01.440 --> 19:04.540]  But I'm not entirely sure what a rotator cuff is.
[19:05.180 --> 19:07.180]  Yeah, there's like a million things in the shoulder.
[19:07.480 --> 19:08.000]  I have no idea.
[19:08.340 --> 19:12.740]  If you're going to get a rotator cuff surgery, you might as well go ahead and get Tommy John
[19:12.740 --> 19:14.060]  surgery at the same time.
[19:14.240 --> 19:16.980]  Preventative, like some baseball players are doing just in case.
[19:17.220 --> 19:18.120]  I'm going to knock it all out.
[19:18.160 --> 19:18.780]  I'm going to get that.
[19:18.860 --> 19:21.280]  I'm going to get the hips done for like what goalies do.
[19:21.940 --> 19:22.300]  Precautionary.
[19:22.780 --> 19:25.500]  I'm going to get my wisdom teeth removed at the same time.
[19:25.540 --> 19:26.240]  We're just doing it all.
[19:26.500 --> 19:27.520]  Oh yeah, appendix.
[19:27.860 --> 19:29.900]  Yeah, I think that's gone already.
[19:29.900 --> 19:32.000]  Oh, pretty sure that's gone.
[19:32.480 --> 19:35.380]  Oh, do you have appendicitis at some point?
[19:35.780 --> 19:40.840]  I think I was just I had to have stomach surgery and I think they just got rid of it at that time.
[19:41.400 --> 19:43.540]  Yeah, you got some gut out, didn't you at some point?
[19:43.780 --> 19:44.320]  I did.
[19:44.420 --> 19:46.220]  Yeah, I got some intestine removed.
[19:46.780 --> 19:48.120]  Oh, lucky.
[19:48.880 --> 19:51.960]  Well, a little short on my test.
[19:52.060 --> 19:52.680]  Long back.
[19:53.120 --> 19:53.620]  Short intestine.
[19:54.120 --> 19:57.180]  Think about getting getting getting your intestine shortened, though.
[19:57.180 --> 20:02.340]  I might have to do something similar someday with my butthole, you know, because the diverticulitis
[20:02.720 --> 20:04.220]  and it's like people worry about that.
[20:04.300 --> 20:06.200]  But you think about you've got so much bundled up in there.
[20:06.300 --> 20:09.720]  If you get a little bit cut out, it's got to just make things a little more efficient, right?
[20:09.800 --> 20:12.400]  Is that less less distance to travel through it?
[20:12.620 --> 20:13.100]  It's crazy.
[20:13.240 --> 20:17.120]  I assume not considering evolution of that exact length.
[20:18.020 --> 20:22.180]  Yeah, I think I think I think it all just got stuffed in there and was like good enough.
[20:22.180 --> 20:30.420]  I feel like with intestine, it's crazy how long it is and just frustrating knowing like
[20:30.420 --> 20:34.760]  when I can't reach something, thinking that there's so much length in me that I just can't
[20:34.760 --> 20:36.060]  use pointless length.
[20:36.460 --> 20:39.580]  It's like you're plastic, man, but it's all trapped inside.
[20:40.080 --> 20:43.080]  Yeah, it's like Russian dolls, but it's shitty.
[20:45.800 --> 20:46.820]  Race the runners.
[20:47.200 --> 20:48.100]  Raise the sails.
[20:48.220 --> 20:49.300]  Raise the sails.
[20:49.700 --> 20:51.840]  Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching.
[20:51.840 --> 20:52.380]  Roger.

[21:40.920 --> 21:43.900]  I just got back from roughly two weeks away from home.
[21:44.180 --> 21:44.840]  Missed you guys, by the way.
[21:44.880 --> 21:48.560]  I was very excited to come and record with you today because we haven't done a podcast
[21:48.560 --> 21:49.120]  in a little bit.
[21:49.520 --> 21:52.480]  Didn't expect to be talking about hair transplants for the first 20 minutes, but
[21:52.480 --> 21:53.400]  that was cool.
[21:54.200 --> 21:56.160]  But I do have one funny little story.
[21:56.220 --> 21:58.140]  I was gone for two weeks, not much happened on my trip,
[21:58.200 --> 22:01.640]  but I did have one funny little minor story I would love to share with you guys.
[22:01.880 --> 22:02.160]  Please.
[22:03.040 --> 22:04.320]  I have a question for you once you're done.
[22:04.760 --> 22:05.040]  Absolutely.
[22:05.180 --> 22:08.260]  Got up to Grosse Pointe in Detroit area, you know, staying with the in-laws.
[22:08.580 --> 22:10.820]  Did some house hunting, the whole deal.
[22:11.360 --> 22:12.080]  Didn't find a house.
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.320]  Narrowed it down to where I want to live, though, if we end up buying a house up there someday.
[22:16.240 --> 22:19.600]  However, one of the cool things we did do is, you know, I'm a big e-bike rider,
[22:20.300 --> 22:23.860]  but it's a whole thing to move the e-bikes up with us,
[22:24.060 --> 22:26.540]  you know, in the car on a three-day journey.
[22:26.940 --> 22:29.980]  And so it's something we've always discussed is if we spend enough time in Michigan,
[22:30.080 --> 22:33.140]  maybe someday it would make sense just to buy e-bikes and have two sets.
[22:33.280 --> 22:34.980]  And so while we were up there this time, I just said,
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.480]  fuck it and pulled the trigger and did it and bought a couple of cheap e-bikes.
[22:38.620 --> 22:43.100]  And Emily and I were in the garage getting them set up and her dad came in and he goes,
[22:43.160 --> 22:44.860]  hey, it'd be really cool if you guys wore helmets.
[22:44.920 --> 22:46.060]  And we're like, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.
[22:46.080 --> 22:47.780]  And he gave us some helmets because they already have them.
[22:48.580 --> 22:50.940]  And we have some kind of cool looking helmets
[22:50.940 --> 22:52.860]  that look kind of like motorcycle helmets at home.
[22:53.080 --> 22:58.340]  These are those helmets that you just put it on and it's like you're asking to be bullied.
[22:58.780 --> 23:00.360]  You know, there's nothing cool about them.
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.860]  And I'm like, yeah, whatever, you know, it's safety first, right?
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.240]  And we're driving strange roads and whatever makes people happy.
[23:08.560 --> 23:11.020]  And so Emily put her helmet on and she's pretty safety conscious.
[23:11.100 --> 23:13.140]  She's been making me wear a helmet at home when I ride my bike.
[23:14.260 --> 23:17.080]  And so we put our helmets on and she's like, do I look stupid?
[23:17.080 --> 23:19.260]  And I was like, no, yeah, but everybody does.
[23:19.360 --> 23:21.060]  Everybody on a bike looks stupid with a helmet on.
[23:21.100 --> 23:23.340]  It's cool. You're just among the group, right?
[23:23.640 --> 23:30.240]  And so we're riding along and just happy as can be riding through sunny Michigan streets.
[23:30.480 --> 23:37.260]  And up on the left is a guy walking a bike, an old dude, like think like old Ben and Jerry,
[23:37.400 --> 23:45.100]  dude, scrawny, long beard, long, scraggly gray hair, got super skinny, got a pushing a bike in
[23:45.100 --> 23:48.060]  like a ten speed in one hand and walking a dog in the other, right?
[23:48.700 --> 23:49.780]  Real crunchy looking dude.
[23:51.260 --> 23:58.700]  And we drive by him and he looks at us and he smiles and he goes, hey, pedal power.
[24:00.500 --> 24:02.180]  And I go, hell yeah.
[24:02.280 --> 24:05.140]  And I wave back at him and we get a few feet down the road and he goes,
[24:05.440 --> 24:07.040]  did that man just make fun of us?
[24:07.300 --> 24:08.480]  Did he make fun of me?
[24:08.820 --> 24:10.120]  And I go, what do you mean?
[24:10.200 --> 24:12.580]  And she goes, did he call us Ninja Turtles?
[24:13.120 --> 24:14.580]  And I go, I'm sorry, what?
[24:14.580 --> 24:15.580]  And she goes, do we look?
[24:15.700 --> 24:17.060]  Is it because we have the helmets on?
[24:17.280 --> 24:19.020]  Did he just call us Ninja Turtles?
[24:19.220 --> 24:21.240]  And I'm like, what did you think he said?
[24:21.580 --> 24:25.540]  She thought when we rode by, the guy yelled, hey, turtle power!
[24:26.460 --> 24:32.940]  Like he was making fun of us for looking like Ninja Turtles because we had helmets on in some way.
[24:33.140 --> 24:38.440]  And I was like, no, but she looked like, I'm sure she wasn't, but she looked like maybe
[24:38.440 --> 24:39.180]  she was about to cry.
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.340]  Like she was really offended that somebody called her a Ninja Turtle.
[24:42.340 --> 24:44.900]  I was like, no, she got bullied.
[24:45.040 --> 24:47.100]  It was complimenting us on riding bikes.
[24:47.260 --> 24:48.900]  And she was like, oh, I'm not sure.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.540]  And I was like, I promise you he yelled pedal power, not turtle power.
[24:52.820 --> 24:56.360]  Maybe if turtles wore the shells on their heads, that'd be more accurate.
[24:56.620 --> 24:58.380]  That was so fucking funny, dude.
[24:58.860 --> 25:02.660]  I don't know how she got turtle power out of that and how that turned into her.
[25:03.080 --> 25:07.860]  I just preying on her natural insecurities from wearing a bike helmet and looking silly.
[25:07.980 --> 25:09.500]  But man, it was, I fucking laughed.
[25:09.500 --> 25:11.480]  I turtle powered for the next two weeks.
[25:12.160 --> 25:12.940]  Hell yeah.
[25:13.940 --> 25:15.540]  I mean, there are skateboarders, right?
[25:16.020 --> 25:17.980]  The turtles, are they skateboarding?
[25:18.100 --> 25:18.560]  I feel like...
[25:18.560 --> 25:19.460]  Yeah, they skateboarded sometimes.
[25:19.880 --> 25:20.120]  Yeah.
[25:20.700 --> 25:23.720]  That's my one thing interesting that happened on my trip to Michigan.
[25:23.760 --> 25:24.740]  Other than...
[25:24.740 --> 25:25.940]  You were gone for two weeks.
[25:26.140 --> 25:27.660]  Well, it was a peaceful time.
[25:27.740 --> 25:30.140]  I watched a lot of sports with Dwight and Kent.
[25:30.500 --> 25:33.540]  Went to a Tigers game, you know, had a million good things.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.980]  One thing I did eat, though, and I was texting you guys about it or slacking you guys about it.
[25:38.020 --> 25:38.920]  I figured we should address.
[25:38.920 --> 25:40.700]  We're coming up on what...
[25:40.700 --> 25:43.360]  Actually, Nick, what date is this episode release?
[25:43.660 --> 25:44.040]  30th.
[25:44.060 --> 25:44.920]  This comes out...
[25:44.920 --> 25:47.080]  30th, 30th, 30th, 30th.
[25:47.120 --> 25:48.140]  This is awesome.
[25:48.320 --> 25:49.580]  So this comes out July 30th?
[25:49.840 --> 25:50.180]  Yeah.
[25:50.360 --> 25:50.660]  That's right.
[25:50.760 --> 25:57.600]  Perfect, because July 31st is the final day of our year of hot dogs.
[25:57.860 --> 25:58.480]  Oh, it is?
[25:58.660 --> 26:00.900]  Yeah, we started on August 1st.
[26:00.920 --> 26:02.420]  So you go August 1st, August 1st.
[26:02.500 --> 26:07.840]  So July 31st, tomorrow will be the last full day for people to eat hot dogs to hit their
[26:07.840 --> 26:10.900]  national average, if that's a thing that they're trying to do.
[26:11.040 --> 26:13.040]  Or just to see, because it's not, you know, it's not a contest.
[26:13.760 --> 26:15.780]  National average being 70-ish, I think.
[26:16.160 --> 26:21.200]  And just to be clear, the day that we're recording this is the 14th of July.
[26:21.540 --> 26:25.680]  So we're a little ahead, a couple weeks ahead of our cutoff date.
[26:26.260 --> 26:31.060]  The last day being the 31st, the last day of hot dogs, but the first day of Gerplers
[26:32.280 --> 26:34.460]  being August the 1st at 1 p.m.
[26:35.300 --> 26:36.440]  Yeah, that's a Friday.
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.020]  And so be there on twitch.tv slash the regulation pod, and you can see that.
[26:42.100 --> 26:45.580]  And then the regulation store, dot com, regulation store, dot store,
[26:45.880 --> 26:46.640]  is where you can get the Gerpler.
[26:46.860 --> 26:48.800]  But guys, if you were talking about...
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.720]  I mean, do you foresee yourself eating more dogs before the end of this year?
[26:52.720 --> 26:55.140]  Well, that's kind of where I want to go with this.
[26:55.460 --> 26:59.700]  And by the way, definitely go celebrate a year of hot dogs by buying a Cosmic Gerpler.
[26:59.780 --> 27:02.460]  And while you're there, we have idiot flags and other stuff in the stock.
[27:02.520 --> 27:04.620]  You go to the store right now, you don't have to wait.
[27:05.020 --> 27:06.120]  There's stuff in the store for you to buy.
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.040]  I feel like I don't do a good job of mentioning that in the podcast, and I should.
[27:09.140 --> 27:10.200]  You can buy idiot flags.
[27:10.340 --> 27:11.280]  There's two different T-shirts.
[27:11.500 --> 27:13.580]  I think there might be four T-shirts you can get or three.
[27:13.680 --> 27:14.320]  There's all kinds of stuff.
[27:14.420 --> 27:15.160]  We got stuff.
[27:15.540 --> 27:16.180]  We got stuff.
[27:16.380 --> 27:22.160]  Anyway, one of the first things I did when I got to Michigan was hit up a Coney, right?
[27:22.240 --> 27:24.440]  Because Michigan is a hot dog state.
[27:24.900 --> 27:28.280]  And I look at it as sort of like a hot dog Shangri-La.
[27:28.520 --> 27:30.500]  I always know I'm going to pack them in when I get up there.
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.440]  Went to a Coney place on day two, I think I was there.
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.500]  Ordered some dogs, sat down, got my hot dog.
[27:39.640 --> 27:44.160]  Looked like I'm fucking just a lovely bog-standard Coney.
[27:45.480 --> 27:51.240]  And I realized something that quite shocked me.
[27:51.900 --> 27:53.460]  I didn't want to eat it.
[27:53.740 --> 28:00.180]  It's the first time I think someone has put a hot dog in front of me and I didn't want it.
[28:00.180 --> 28:06.480]  You know, we've come a long way since the original prompt that I issued you guys over a year ago now,
[28:06.600 --> 28:10.120]  which was just what's one food you don't say no to when it's offered to you, right?
[28:10.140 --> 28:10.920]  For me, it was hot dogs.
[28:11.320 --> 28:13.300]  I think I have found my limit.
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.760]  I ate that hot dog because I needed to and because I paid for it.
[28:17.900 --> 28:20.100]  And it was fine.
[28:20.220 --> 28:21.640]  It was what a hot dog should taste like.
[28:21.820 --> 28:28.140]  But I think I just hit a limit where hot dogs are no longer appetizing to me currently.
[28:28.760 --> 28:29.460]  Wasn't sure.
[28:29.620 --> 28:31.100]  Like I was like, maybe I have an off day, right?
[28:31.180 --> 28:32.040]  Maybe things aren't going.
[28:32.320 --> 28:33.640]  Maybe it's just a weird day.
[28:33.720 --> 28:34.420]  I've been traveling.
[28:34.720 --> 28:35.420]  I got travel tummy.
[28:35.660 --> 28:35.980]  Who knows?
[28:36.180 --> 28:37.640]  You just got called a ninja turtle.
[28:37.940 --> 28:41.800]  Like, I just got bullied by an old hippie on a bike.
[28:42.180 --> 28:44.900]  Yeah, so I waited a couple days.
[28:45.740 --> 28:46.700]  Avoided hot dogs.
[28:47.460 --> 28:48.260]  Focused on pizza.
[28:48.840 --> 28:50.740]  Then I went to a Tigers game.
[28:51.080 --> 28:52.680]  Got myself a game dog.
[28:52.860 --> 28:54.640]  You can't go wrong with a game dog, right?
[28:55.780 --> 28:57.380]  It was a struggle to eat it.
[28:57.380 --> 28:58.460]  You're dogged out.
[28:58.520 --> 28:59.520]  You got dogged out.
[29:00.180 --> 29:02.840]  Guys, I'm officially dogged out.
[29:03.220 --> 29:07.280]  I don't know if anything is going to change between the recording of this July 14th and
[29:07.280 --> 29:09.420]  July 31st, but I...
[29:09.420 --> 29:11.240]  Oh, and that's a delicious looking dog.
[29:11.620 --> 29:13.500]  I very well may...
[29:13.500 --> 29:14.380]  Those are my two dogs, yeah.
[29:14.440 --> 29:16.880]  And you can't see it, but there's onions and peppers under that dog.
[29:16.980 --> 29:18.100]  They're just... it's laid on top of them.
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.580]  I very well may be done with hot dogs.
[29:22.740 --> 29:24.560]  Not forever, like a corn dog.
[29:24.900 --> 29:25.040]  Absolutely.
[29:25.040 --> 29:27.900]  After a year of hot dogs, I may...
[29:27.900 --> 29:30.480]  I'm considering taking a year off of hot dogs.
[29:30.880 --> 29:31.240]  Really?
[29:31.980 --> 29:36.400]  I think this is a more interesting experiment to see how many dogs it takes you to get
[29:36.400 --> 29:36.900]  dogged out.
[29:36.980 --> 29:38.700]  Because how many corn dogs dogged you out?
[29:39.300 --> 29:40.400]  A lifetime of them.
[29:40.520 --> 29:40.920]  I don't know.
[29:41.540 --> 29:44.140]  But in that one year, it can't have been more than like 20, surely, was it?
[29:44.160 --> 29:44.980]  Oh, no, surely.
[29:45.140 --> 29:46.280]  It wasn't more than 20.
[29:46.700 --> 29:46.900]  Yeah.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.140]  So I don't know what I'm at, like 58 or 59, maybe.
[29:50.560 --> 29:50.900]  I don't know.
[29:50.980 --> 29:52.040]  Somewhere around the high 50s.
[29:52.540 --> 29:53.660]  I don't know what my current count is.
[29:53.660 --> 30:00.260]  But I don't think an experiment has ever been so skewed by the act of measuring it
[30:00.260 --> 30:01.920]  in all of human history.
[30:04.120 --> 30:06.220]  At no point were any averages...
[30:06.820 --> 30:09.040]  I definitely ate 40 more hot dogs than I would have.
[30:12.100 --> 30:13.480]  I think everyone did.
[30:13.740 --> 30:18.660]  I think I ruined hot dogs for myself in the near future in the service of this podcast.
[30:19.220 --> 30:21.860]  I think the hot dog boat is going to pass you by again.
[30:22.420 --> 30:22.820]  I think it'll come back.
[30:22.820 --> 30:23.300]  I agree.
[30:23.300 --> 30:23.840]  I agree.
[30:23.960 --> 30:24.540]  It'll come back.
[30:24.640 --> 30:25.000]  But man...
[30:25.640 --> 30:30.160]  Yeah, so we found out your dogged out count, and it's going to be interesting to see how
[30:30.160 --> 30:31.320]  long it takes for you to bounce back.
[30:32.020 --> 30:32.340]  Yeah.
[30:32.640 --> 30:36.700]  I want to make a prediction that he eats one more before the count's done for the year.
[30:36.700 --> 30:41.800]  I'm going to eat one more, I guarantee you, because at some point between now and July 31st,
[30:41.980 --> 30:44.100]  Eric and I will go to Narnia together.
[30:44.120 --> 30:48.600]  All I was thinking about was there's no way he's not eating a dog from Narnia.
[30:48.960 --> 30:49.980]  Like, there's just no way he's not.
[30:50.300 --> 30:51.320]  I'll eat the Narnia dog.
[30:51.320 --> 30:53.360]  Which is, by the way, I saw him post about it.
[30:53.420 --> 30:56.500]  It's kind of like naturally a smash dog, he was saying.
[30:56.920 --> 30:57.420]  Oh, that's great.
[30:57.820 --> 30:58.800]  It's all cut up and stuff.
[30:58.820 --> 30:59.340]  It's really good.
[30:59.680 --> 30:59.960]  It's great.
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.020]  I feel like if I go to Narnia, I might be able to get double digits before the end of the year.
[31:04.500 --> 31:05.040]  I agree.
[31:05.840 --> 31:06.460]  They look delicious.
[31:07.020 --> 31:08.400]  Let's go Monday when you're back in town.
[31:08.740 --> 31:09.040]  All right.
[31:10.080 --> 31:10.720]  Back Tuesday.
[31:11.460 --> 31:12.520]  Tuesday, when you're back in town.
[31:13.680 --> 31:14.580]  I could go Monday at night.
[31:15.200 --> 31:18.420]  I figured that, Jeff, and I don't mean to be critical of the place.
[31:18.420 --> 31:21.740]  I feel like that first dog you posted, very unappetizing.
[31:22.080 --> 31:23.600]  I was thinking maybe that would be it.
[31:23.700 --> 31:25.460]  Visually, I think it doesn't look good.
[31:25.500 --> 31:28.340]  But that second dog looks beautiful.
[31:28.620 --> 31:29.720]  It's a perfect looking dog.
[31:30.060 --> 31:31.560]  That first one does look dog shit.
[31:32.100 --> 31:34.200]  Yeah, it looks visually very ugly.
[31:34.640 --> 31:35.880]  It's a bog-standard coney.
[31:35.960 --> 31:38.560]  It's just chili and onions and then a hot dog in there.
[31:38.620 --> 31:39.660]  It's fucking, they're delicious.
[31:39.800 --> 31:40.800]  This cheese one too, I think.
[31:41.000 --> 31:45.060]  But not criticizing the taste in any way, just visually unappetizing.
[31:45.320 --> 31:48.240]  It also might be the fault of the photographer, not the hot dog.
[31:48.420 --> 31:48.760]  Maybe.
[31:49.120 --> 31:50.520]  We got to throw that into it too.
[31:50.900 --> 31:56.280]  But yeah, so if anybody, not only did I not, I think, hit the national average,
[31:56.700 --> 32:00.900]  I think I ruined hot dogs trying to do it, at least for a while.
[32:01.700 --> 32:03.220]  Really kind of bummed about it.
[32:03.480 --> 32:08.320]  I predict that it will be back by June of next year.
[32:09.280 --> 32:11.840]  So it'll only take me 11 months to recover, not 12?
[32:12.240 --> 32:13.380]  I think so.
[32:13.480 --> 32:14.980]  I think once we maybe...
[32:16.180 --> 32:17.120]  No, I think June.
[32:17.120 --> 32:21.240]  I think once it starts feeling summery, you'll get that itch again.
[32:21.740 --> 32:23.160]  Maybe, I hope so.
[32:23.280 --> 32:25.260]  But as we said, I don't think you're gone.
[32:25.340 --> 32:30.060]  I think you're like, you're like a hot dog lighthouse in the night
[32:30.060 --> 32:33.340]  and the boats just start coming through for a little bit.
[32:33.940 --> 32:34.700]  But you're still looking.
[32:35.200 --> 32:37.940]  You're still shining that light out there, trying to find it.
[32:38.320 --> 32:41.900]  I don't, I don't want to be off the dog, you know?
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.360]  It's not, it's not a choice that I'm making.
[32:44.480 --> 32:46.480]  It's a choice that my stomach is making for me.
[32:47.280 --> 32:47.760]  Unfortunately.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.020]  It is.
[32:49.100 --> 32:49.280]  We'll see.
[32:49.420 --> 32:49.820]  We'll see.
[32:50.080 --> 32:50.360]  We'll see.
[32:50.400 --> 32:51.280]  We will find out.
[32:51.660 --> 32:52.160]  We'll find out.
[32:52.680 --> 32:56.460]  I had a very exciting rabbit hole.
[32:56.580 --> 32:57.100]  I went down.
[32:57.340 --> 32:58.020]  Big lore drop.
[32:58.560 --> 33:06.160]  I watched the movie The Edge recently, which is a film starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec
[33:06.160 --> 33:07.900]  Baldwin, and there's a bear in it.
[33:08.180 --> 33:12.040]  And that's all I knew about it, is it's a movie about Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin
[33:12.040 --> 33:12.880]  fighting a bear.
[33:13.520 --> 33:15.100]  And it was fun.
[33:15.100 --> 33:20.040]  It's a movie that takes itself too seriously at times, and it's completely cartoonish and
[33:20.040 --> 33:22.100]  ridiculous during it.
[33:22.700 --> 33:27.600]  But and I'm glad I didn't see this in theaters because it would have been an intentional
[33:27.600 --> 33:27.940]  moment.
[33:28.180 --> 33:33.120]  It is supposed to be a very intense movie where they're getting chased by a man hunting
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.300]  bear that they have to deal with.
[33:35.820 --> 33:38.760]  And then you get to the end credits and the end credits.
[33:38.760 --> 33:45.720]  The first thing that appears is it transitions from from how did you survive this vicious
[33:45.720 --> 33:50.840]  thing that killed other men to shout out to our homie Bart the bear for making this
[33:50.840 --> 33:51.640]  movie with us.
[33:51.640 --> 33:52.840]  We like Bart the bear.
[33:53.220 --> 33:54.500]  That's thanks.
[33:54.600 --> 34:00.300]  Big ups for your work in this film, which immediately led me to Google Bart the bear.
[34:00.360 --> 34:04.640]  I needed to see what other films he had been in, and it did not disappoint.
[34:04.640 --> 34:10.820]  His IMDb, I will say, unfortunately for Bart, the bear was typecasted a lot as the bear.
[34:11.940 --> 34:15.920]  He has so many roles that are just bear or the bear.
[34:16.120 --> 34:17.540]  He got to be Walking Thunder.
[34:17.940 --> 34:18.920]  That was exciting.
[34:19.280 --> 34:24.580]  But my personal favorite role of his was the bear attacking children and fighting Arie
[34:24.580 --> 34:25.280]  Schwieg.
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.840]  I just love that they shouted out the name of the bear so I could Google the bear, which
[34:30.840 --> 34:34.400]  was not a thing when this movie came out and immediately go deep on the bear.
[34:35.020 --> 34:41.680]  Bart the bear was in a bunch of movies, had a brother, I believe that I'm blanking their
[34:41.680 --> 34:44.460]  name, a tank or brick or something.
[34:44.760 --> 34:49.880]  That means in that TV series, there surely were other bears not attacking children, like
[34:49.880 --> 34:50.760]  if they had to specify.
[34:51.180 --> 34:51.980]  That's a great.
[34:52.060 --> 34:53.380]  I didn't even consider that implication.
[34:53.920 --> 34:55.720]  But I guess there's a whole line of bears.
[34:55.820 --> 35:00.440]  There was a Bart 2, which is unrelated to Bart, but the same people trained it and just
[35:00.440 --> 35:01.500]  named it Bart 2.
[35:01.500 --> 35:05.220]  But then Bart 2 had a sister, I think, that was in more movies.
[35:05.740 --> 35:10.240]  Brad Pitt made a documentary, I think, about Bart the bear for the National Geographic
[35:10.240 --> 35:10.660]  channel.
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.260]  I don't know why he was dealing with bear, but the more I learned about Bart the bear,
[35:15.700 --> 35:21.080]  what a rabbit hole I went on and just what a strange the idea of like animal IMDb pages
[35:21.080 --> 35:25.060]  thinking about that, making like career choices as an actor really amused me.
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.200]  Like Bart's mulling over is the next batch of scripts to see which one makes the most
[35:31.200 --> 35:31.740]  sense for him.
[35:32.080 --> 35:32.420]  Absolutely.
[35:33.080 --> 35:36.740]  Like, he really wants to be in 12 Monkeys, but does he want to be the bear again?
[35:37.360 --> 35:38.140]  It's tough.
[35:38.940 --> 35:40.440]  What a tough choice to make.
[35:40.640 --> 35:42.720]  Has anybody else seen that movie The Edge?
[35:43.340 --> 35:43.720]  No.
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.460]  No, I saw it in the theater and the correct me if I'm wrong, Andrew, but the only thing
[35:48.460 --> 35:52.840]  I remember about that film is there's a scene where Alec Baldwin tells Anthony Hopkins,
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.080]  that's the spirit that beat the Japanese, which I always thought was such a wild thing
[35:57.080 --> 35:57.480]  to say.
[35:58.040 --> 35:58.440]  What?
[35:58.860 --> 36:01.220]  Was he talking about the Japanese?
[36:01.500 --> 36:03.080]  Referring to World War Two, I believe.
[36:03.420 --> 36:06.120]  But yeah, he's trying to like toughen up Anthony Hopkins.
[36:07.440 --> 36:10.040]  And he's also trying to kill Anthony Hopkins the whole time, too, right?
[36:10.080 --> 36:11.860]  Because he's trying to steal his wife or something.
[36:12.420 --> 36:13.820]  The look he's giving in the movie poster.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.080]  I've seen him give that look to a lot of paparazzi.
[36:18.220 --> 36:24.660]  It is a strange movie where Anthony Hopkins plays the billionaire to a model wife and
[36:24.660 --> 36:31.160]  Alec Baldwin is the photographer of the wife, I guess, like they regularly shoot together
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.980]  and there is sort of a weird implication of their relationship dynamics.
[36:35.980 --> 36:38.540]  And then they end up crashing the scenario.
[36:38.540 --> 36:41.480]  And it's not really brought up until spoilers.
[36:41.700 --> 36:43.380]  Anthony Hopkins kills the bear.
[36:43.660 --> 36:51.840]  And then what's very funny is they kill the bear and then like the next transitional scene,
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.300]  they've made entire outfits out of the bear's remains.
[36:55.300 --> 37:01.480]  Like it took them five minutes to skin this bear and then sew together these very elaborate outfits.
[37:02.220 --> 37:06.320]  Then they go to a little they find a little hut and then Alec Baldwin's like,
[37:06.340 --> 37:10.280]  yeah, I'm going to murder you because I want to steal your money and be with your wife.
[37:11.320 --> 37:11.960]  He just tells him.
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.960]  Yeah, well, it's a really kind of it's not very exciting of a reveal where
[37:17.960 --> 37:19.940]  Anthony Hopkins is looking for a thing to light.
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.180]  And he opens up a gift that his wife gave him because it was his birthday the day before.
[37:25.360 --> 37:31.440]  And he realized that on the receipt, it was also Alec Baldwin's watch that that he got,
[37:31.520 --> 37:35.920]  like his wife bought like three different gifts for three different people at the same time.
[37:35.980 --> 37:37.020]  And one of them was the watch.
[37:37.580 --> 37:43.220]  It takes a very strange turn, though, where he he traps Alec Baldwin into a fall pit
[37:43.220 --> 37:50.320]  where he gets impaled through the thigh by a massive log and then he just saves him
[37:50.320 --> 37:52.060]  like he doesn't kill him.
[37:52.180 --> 37:55.360]  He then retrieves him from the thing and they go kayaking for a while.
[37:57.180 --> 37:58.860]  And then it becomes a buddy comedy.
[37:59.420 --> 38:00.540]  And then it becomes a buddy comedy.
[38:00.740 --> 38:03.500]  And then Alec Baldwin's like, oh, it's crazy.
[38:04.120 --> 38:04.600]  Rapids.
[38:04.660 --> 38:06.700]  And the bears wearing a watch as well.
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.740]  Oh, the bear has a son and the son shows up.
[38:09.840 --> 38:11.700]  The sun bears not happy.
[38:11.780 --> 38:12.380]  It's Jaws.
[38:12.380 --> 38:13.940]  It's Jaws with bears.
[38:14.800 --> 38:19.480]  It had some very odd casting, too, where it's the you'll know his name,
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.140]  the guy from Beverly Hills Cop that like is Eddie Murphy.
[38:22.500 --> 38:28.140]  Now the other guy, that's the shop owner that like Eddie Murphy interacts with.
[38:28.180 --> 38:29.880]  And he comes back in the third movie.
[38:30.180 --> 38:31.580]  I think shop owner.
[38:31.920 --> 38:32.520]  What shop?
[38:33.100 --> 38:36.580]  It's like he goes to like an art school, the really sarcastic guy.
[38:37.320 --> 38:37.660]  Yeah.
[38:37.840 --> 38:39.140]  The art gallery, dude.
[38:39.140 --> 38:43.040]  The light European guy that has like a European accent in the movie.
[38:43.300 --> 38:44.260]  Yeah, I don't.
[38:44.380 --> 38:46.620]  I'm surprised you don't just know who this person is, Jeff.
[38:47.760 --> 38:50.020]  Are you talking about Bronson Pinchot?
[38:50.440 --> 38:52.100]  Yeah, maybe he plays Serge.
[38:52.700 --> 38:53.560]  Yes, him.
[38:53.740 --> 38:55.820]  He's in the edge, but he has no dialogue.
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.000]  OK, I just thought that was strange.
[39:03.260 --> 39:07.160]  I was expecting him to like be involved.
[39:09.380 --> 39:12.340]  My main takeaway, though, from the edge was that Bart the bear exists.
[39:12.480 --> 39:14.220]  It was a lot of fun to go down that rabbit hole.
[39:14.520 --> 39:15.020]  Bart the bear.
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.320]  I think that's the first time Eric's picture is the first time I've seen a bear cock.
[39:24.560 --> 39:26.600]  Go look at this bear's unit.
[39:27.040 --> 39:27.320]  Let's see.
[39:27.980 --> 39:33.040]  It's weird that such a large imposing animal is never referred to as like
[39:33.500 --> 39:36.560]  a large like people go to horse cock a lot.
[39:37.140 --> 39:38.700]  Nobody ever says he's hung like a bear.
[39:39.140 --> 39:40.020]  Like a grizzly.
[39:40.260 --> 39:42.620]  Yeah, so maybe they're not that impressive.
[39:44.540 --> 39:45.720]  I don't want to.
[39:45.800 --> 39:47.120]  I don't want to overdo this bit.
[39:47.400 --> 39:48.980]  I think we'll have some separation from it.
[39:49.800 --> 39:51.520]  But I have a new things I learned.
[39:52.100 --> 39:54.420]  OK, I can't wait.
[39:54.580 --> 39:55.160]  This is awesome.
[39:55.460 --> 39:59.320]  Oh, yeah, it's kind of connected to the edge a little bit.
[39:59.520 --> 40:03.020]  You want to read those off and we can pick one and we can sort of dissect it.
[40:03.100 --> 40:06.940]  So my three prompts are Hitman Fool, Doom is Here and Bear Disease.
[40:07.580 --> 40:09.760]  Can I ask how many of these things that you've learned?
[40:09.840 --> 40:10.320]  Have you learned?
[40:11.020 --> 40:12.100]  I don't know what that means.
[40:12.880 --> 40:14.480]  Well, last last time you hadn't learned.
[40:14.720 --> 40:16.840]  Oh, because I didn't know because last time I asked a question, I get it.
[40:16.920 --> 40:17.760]  That funny bit.
[40:19.400 --> 40:20.240]  What's the bit?
[40:20.400 --> 40:20.880]  You didn't.
[40:21.000 --> 40:21.500]  It was you.
[40:21.660 --> 40:22.600]  You hadn't learned.
[40:22.960 --> 40:24.260]  Yeah, but this is stuff I learned.
[40:24.800 --> 40:25.260]  Oh, OK.
[40:25.680 --> 40:27.440]  But these are all things I've learned definitively.
[40:27.660 --> 40:28.880]  But that's what you said last time, too.
[40:29.520 --> 40:30.180]  Yeah, but I was.
[40:32.940 --> 40:34.820]  OK, what is Hitman Fool, Andrew?
[40:35.300 --> 40:35.860]  Hitman Fool.
[40:37.240 --> 40:40.640]  I realized that there is a map in Hitman.
[40:41.140 --> 40:45.400]  So I've been replaying Hitman 3 because it has all of the Hitman games in it.
[40:45.440 --> 40:46.840]  Has Hitman 1, Hitman 2, Hitman 3.
[40:47.240 --> 40:49.100]  At least all the games in the most recent trilogy.
[40:49.500 --> 40:52.000]  And I've been going through and getting.
[40:52.700 --> 40:54.500]  You call it level mastery.
[40:55.260 --> 40:55.980]  So I've gone through.
[40:56.040 --> 40:58.120]  I've played some of these games multiple times.
[40:58.160 --> 41:01.140]  I played Hitman 2 through level mastery at least twice.
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.500]  Hitman 3, I've done it doing it on Hitman 1 in Hitman 3.
[41:06.940 --> 41:08.860]  And one of the challenges you get.
[41:08.980 --> 41:11.480]  So to get mastery on a level, you have to do a bunch of challenges.
[41:11.760 --> 41:16.920]  And one of them is to discover all of the locations within the map.
[41:16.980 --> 41:18.740]  So there are different rooms and sectors.
[41:19.440 --> 41:25.900]  I didn't know that you could hit select and go into a map screen and just see a map.
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.160]  And I've spent probably over 100 hours playing these Hitman games.
[41:30.300 --> 41:30.620]  This trilogy.
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.320]  This this is coming from a guy who recently complained about Mind's Eye,
[41:34.420 --> 41:36.300]  where it has a mini map, but no map.
[41:36.940 --> 41:38.880]  Yeah, but that's on Mind's Eye.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.120]  You never thought, oh, this mini map in Hitman doesn't have a full map.
[41:43.460 --> 41:47.540]  I guess I've never felt the need to use it for how I play.
[41:47.920 --> 41:51.980]  Like, I'm just kind of walking around and holding right bumper to see.
[41:52.240 --> 41:53.300]  Like, I definitely never.
[41:53.900 --> 41:54.940]  Yeah, you don't need the map.
[41:55.060 --> 41:55.280]  You're good.
[41:55.380 --> 41:55.760]  I don't.
[41:56.000 --> 41:56.820]  I don't need it.
[41:56.900 --> 41:57.340]  I'm good.
[41:57.800 --> 42:05.020]  But what I didn't realize is on the map, it tells you what areas you haven't visited before.
[42:05.820 --> 42:11.440]  So up until this point, I would spend sometimes like two hours
[42:12.060 --> 42:15.400]  just scavenging every corner of a map, being like,
[42:15.460 --> 42:17.500]  I found 30 of 31 locations.
[42:17.620 --> 42:21.180]  Where the fuck is this one room that I can't find?
[42:21.460 --> 42:25.560]  All the while not knowing that I could have just hit select and then
[42:25.560 --> 42:30.600]  checked every area of the map immediately and figured out where I was missing.
[42:30.640 --> 42:34.040]  It notifies there's a marker as to where you haven't been.
[42:35.240 --> 42:36.540]  Huge waste of time.
[42:36.700 --> 42:39.120]  Such a big part of that game is the map.
[42:39.540 --> 42:41.380]  Gav, can I ask a question just between you and I?
[42:41.840 --> 42:45.600]  Can I be let off the hook now for not knowing about how to auto-aim
[42:45.600 --> 42:47.100]  and crackdown until after I beat it?
[42:47.220 --> 42:48.180]  Because this seems way worse.
[42:48.480 --> 42:49.120]  Yeah, I think.
[42:49.320 --> 42:50.340]  Yeah, it's definitely.
[42:51.020 --> 42:53.560]  I think it's different because this is like mechanically,
[42:53.700 --> 42:55.840]  I'm not missing something within the game.
[42:56.460 --> 42:57.820]  It's just like the map.
[42:58.260 --> 42:58.720]  What are you talking?
[42:59.040 --> 43:01.580]  Mechanically, you're missing the whole mechanic of the map.
[43:01.580 --> 43:05.260]  I am not missing a mechanic in playing the game
[43:05.260 --> 43:09.100]  and like how I interact with the world as the character.
[43:10.540 --> 43:11.500]  Does that make sense?
[43:11.560 --> 43:16.080]  That's the only service a map provides in a video game
[43:16.080 --> 43:18.620]  is to help you interact with the game as the character.
[43:18.940 --> 43:19.700]  Oh, it's so good.
[43:19.740 --> 43:22.040]  It's like watching a coyote with his foot caught in a trap,
[43:22.120 --> 43:23.900]  just going like, I gotta get out of this thing.
[43:24.080 --> 43:24.420]  No, no, no.
[43:24.420 --> 43:26.800]  I think there's a difference because what Jeff was doing,
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.660]  Jeff shoots somebody in crackdown all the time.
[43:30.660 --> 43:31.980]  That's all you're doing.
[43:32.420 --> 43:34.840]  You're not always looking at a map in Hitman.
[43:35.340 --> 43:38.780]  You sometimes would engage with it to like find your place or whatever.
[43:38.800 --> 43:41.020]  You're not always shooting in crackdown.
[43:41.140 --> 43:41.800]  Sometimes you're punching.
[43:42.260 --> 43:42.680]  What else are you doing?
[43:43.100 --> 43:44.240]  You can punch people.
[43:44.620 --> 43:45.640]  You can kick people.
[43:46.040 --> 43:46.700]  You can drive.
[43:47.340 --> 43:48.060]  You can fall asleep.
[43:48.440 --> 43:48.860]  Climb.
[43:49.140 --> 43:50.720]  You can race and fall asleep.
[43:50.780 --> 43:54.120]  If you're going to do a pie chart of things you're doing in crackdown,
[43:54.320 --> 43:56.260]  70% of it is firing weapons.
[43:56.800 --> 43:58.460]  I bet if you were to do a pie chart
[43:58.460 --> 44:00.860]  and people that play the game properly in Hitman,
[44:01.480 --> 44:04.140]  look at the full map would come up a lot more than you realize.
[44:04.420 --> 44:05.820]  I think less than 30%.
[44:06.660 --> 44:10.540]  The original games, you would have a live feed of where everyone was on the map, too.
[44:10.700 --> 44:13.240]  It's like how you knew where everyone was going to be on the other side of the door.
[44:13.860 --> 44:16.260]  I've looked at the map in other Hitman games.
[44:16.380 --> 44:18.600]  I just never engage with it in this trilogy.
[44:19.480 --> 44:20.700]  So you knew it existed.
[44:21.060 --> 44:23.200]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:23.260 --> 44:23.540]  Hang on.
[44:23.580 --> 44:24.820]  That makes it even worse.
[44:24.920 --> 44:25.120]  What?
[44:25.240 --> 44:25.680]  Hang on.
[44:25.840 --> 44:26.460]  Wait, what?
[44:26.720 --> 44:27.080]  Hang on.
[44:28.020 --> 44:31.380]  Wait, you've used the map in other Hitman games?
[44:31.860 --> 44:35.800]  Because it would, as Gavin said, it would actually show where the enemies are
[44:35.800 --> 44:37.320]  and like where the target is.
[44:37.440 --> 44:41.060]  But in this one, you just use your intuition and you see.
[44:42.760 --> 44:44.260]  You just see where they are.
[44:44.580 --> 44:45.640]  You don't need the map.
[44:45.700 --> 44:46.600]  Man, it's so crazy.
[44:46.740 --> 44:48.360]  They took the map out of this game.
[44:48.420 --> 44:49.760]  That's so strange.
[44:50.060 --> 44:50.820]  That's some stuff.
[44:51.020 --> 44:54.020]  Well, there were some pretty big changes in how Hitman worked,
[44:54.200 --> 44:56.940]  especially from like Absolution to the original trilogy.
[44:57.080 --> 44:58.800]  There's a big shift, Absolution.
[44:58.880 --> 45:00.600]  I would say it's worse because of this.
[45:00.820 --> 45:03.500]  You played a version of Hitman before that had a full map.
[45:03.760 --> 45:05.920]  So you had to load this version of Hitman up and go like,
[45:05.980 --> 45:07.080]  oh, I guess the map's gone.
[45:07.240 --> 45:08.480]  I won't bother looking for it.
[45:08.660 --> 45:09.780]  I was playing Crackdown 1.
[45:09.900 --> 45:12.080]  I didn't know that there was a lock on mechanic in the game
[45:12.080 --> 45:14.520]  because I had no previous knowledge with Crackdown.
[45:14.600 --> 45:16.500]  I just missed that part of the tutorial.
[45:17.260 --> 45:22.980]  So with you, there's a legacy of map that you had experienced in Hitman.
[45:23.200 --> 45:26.220]  So if you were going for Silent Assassin and you got hit by a camera,
[45:26.220 --> 45:29.360]  you wouldn't just look on the map where the security was
[45:29.360 --> 45:30.460]  to go and turn off the cameras.
[45:30.580 --> 45:32.800]  You would just walk around until you found the office.
[45:33.680 --> 45:34.960]  I mean, I would never...
[45:34.960 --> 45:37.720]  Like, Silent Assassin is a thing I would do after multiple runs.
[45:37.780 --> 45:40.160]  And by that point, I just know where the feeds were.
[45:40.980 --> 45:43.620]  Like, you never go in thinking like,
[45:43.660 --> 45:45.740]  I'm going to get Silent Assassin on my first try.
[45:45.840 --> 45:48.180]  It's like the first time I play Hitman level,
[45:48.660 --> 45:51.080]  I am just walking around the map,
[45:51.480 --> 45:53.880]  scanning things and like registering personally.
[45:54.520 --> 45:56.700]  Like, OK, this is here. This does that.
[45:56.780 --> 45:59.640]  I can use this like it's just exploration.
[46:00.100 --> 46:02.580]  There's nothing more satisfying than a first attempt Silent Assassin.
[46:03.180 --> 46:04.700]  I see. I would never even...
[46:04.700 --> 46:06.700]  That's just not how I play these games ever.
[46:07.760 --> 46:08.720]  That's a later thing.
[46:09.460 --> 46:11.300]  That is if I ever want to get sweaty.
[46:11.760 --> 46:15.320]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[46:15.680 --> 46:18.560]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[46:18.660 --> 46:22.260]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[46:22.260 --> 46:24.140]  Available for a limited time.
[46:24.400 --> 46:26.400]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[46:27.020 --> 46:28.420]  Hey, it's Paris.
[46:28.860 --> 46:31.000]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[46:31.240 --> 46:32.040]  Like stars.
[46:32.480 --> 46:32.760]  Duh.
[46:33.280 --> 46:36.900]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.820]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[46:42.280 --> 46:43.700]  making s'mores with the kids,
[46:44.220 --> 46:46.520]  while a national park is our backdrop.
[46:47.240 --> 46:49.560]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[46:50.100 --> 46:50.780]  That's hot.
[46:50.780 --> 46:54.520]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton dot com.
[46:54.800 --> 46:56.220]  Hilton for the stay.
[46:57.100 --> 46:58.480]  But yeah, that is Hitman Fool.
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.780]  The other options are Doom is here and Baird Disease.
[47:02.700 --> 47:03.500]  Doom is here.
[47:04.180 --> 47:07.480]  I've been listening to the radio a lot recently.
[47:09.480 --> 47:12.400]  I just have gotten in the habit of I enjoy.
[47:12.820 --> 47:17.620]  I have an app that like I can listen to radio stations all across the world.
[47:18.820 --> 47:20.800]  Uh, and I just cycle through.
[47:21.020 --> 47:22.700]  I just find random things.
[47:22.880 --> 47:24.180]  My dad used to do that.
[47:24.620 --> 47:25.000]  Yeah.
[47:27.020 --> 47:28.920]  Son, it's been so long.
[47:30.440 --> 47:31.820]  I've just been scanning through.
[47:32.180 --> 47:36.120]  Jeff, you were in Vegas a while back throwing first pitch.
[47:36.660 --> 47:39.600]  I believe I was throwing heat, as they say.
[47:39.740 --> 47:40.660]  Yeah, you were throwing heat.
[47:40.780 --> 47:41.400]  So I was in Vegas.
[47:41.680 --> 47:45.220]  And so that just has been like one of the areas in my app.
[47:45.260 --> 47:46.560]  And I was like, oh, go back to Vegas.
[47:47.120 --> 47:49.140]  And I was just cycling through.
[47:49.700 --> 47:53.080]  And I'll use this to sleep a lot of the time, too, where it has a sleep
[47:53.080 --> 47:55.480]  timer for like an hour, it'll turn off automatically.
[47:56.160 --> 48:00.240]  But I have an issue where if I listen to things I care about or enjoy,
[48:00.360 --> 48:02.200]  then I stay awake and I listen to them.
[48:02.540 --> 48:06.060]  So I needed something that I didn't give a shit about at all.
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.700]  And so I was like, oh, there's a religious radio station.
[48:09.780 --> 48:10.880]  Let me throw this on.
[48:10.940 --> 48:12.760]  I don't give a fuck about whatever is being said.
[48:12.800 --> 48:13.720]  It's just noise.
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.600]  Now, you mentioned a map.
[48:15.660 --> 48:18.260]  Is this a full map or a mini map of these radio stations?
[48:18.380 --> 48:22.300]  It's a full map, but in this one, it doesn't show the target locations,
[48:22.420 --> 48:24.580]  unlike previous iterations of the app.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.700]  And you also can't lock on to cities, despite what you may try to do.
[48:31.920 --> 48:32.820]  I put this on.
[48:32.820 --> 48:34.520]  So I was listening to this religious radio station.
[48:34.820 --> 48:39.240]  I didn't realize that there are people like I obviously I get the God thing,
[48:39.300 --> 48:40.260]  believing in God or whatever.
[48:40.760 --> 48:43.140]  I didn't know that there are people that are just like there are demons
[48:43.140 --> 48:44.320]  on the streets.
[48:44.960 --> 48:46.020]  That's crazy to me.
[48:46.200 --> 48:48.160]  We live in doom in some people's eyes.
[48:48.800 --> 48:51.040]  There's just straight up demons walking around.
[48:51.340 --> 48:52.040]  Fucking nuts.
[48:52.620 --> 48:52.720]  What?
[48:53.120 --> 48:56.200]  Yeah, I think that's often why people will just kill their whole family.
[48:56.340 --> 48:57.840]  It's just to get rid of the demons.
[48:58.720 --> 49:03.180]  Well, it's just it was people just being like, like, oh, the Satan's out there
[49:03.180 --> 49:05.740]  and demons and evil and whatnot.
[49:05.880 --> 49:07.060]  It's like, that's fucking crazy.
[49:07.620 --> 49:11.940]  I understood the idea of like being good or being a bad person,
[49:11.940 --> 49:15.680]  but to literally interpret the existence of demons walking around
[49:15.680 --> 49:18.360]  like in these people's eyes, we're living in doom.
[49:18.520 --> 49:19.420]  This is crazy.
[49:19.840 --> 49:22.120]  So is it like a they live situation where we can't tell?
[49:22.240 --> 49:23.080]  I think so.
[49:23.160 --> 49:24.420]  Yeah, from my understanding.
[49:25.180 --> 49:27.060]  Also, I'm not deep dive in the station.
[49:27.140 --> 49:30.360]  It was just I threw it on one evening and I was listening to a guy
[49:30.360 --> 49:33.680]  that sounded like piglet tell me that demons were real.
[49:34.060 --> 49:35.640]  And I was like, this is crazy.
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.540]  Those people have to be and I hope this isn't a controversial statement,
[49:40.600 --> 49:41.140]  but maybe it is.
[49:41.140 --> 49:42.700]  I know who you're talking about.
[49:42.800 --> 49:46.280]  Those people have to be the dumbest motherfuckers on Earth.
[49:46.480 --> 49:47.880]  It's just a wild thing to believe.
[49:50.820 --> 49:53.580]  It just it opens up so many other.
[49:54.380 --> 49:54.860]  I guess.
[49:55.080 --> 49:55.760]  I don't know.
[49:55.920 --> 49:56.680]  It's just it's wild.
[49:57.420 --> 50:01.940]  I never processed the concept of literal demon acceptance or belief.
[50:02.320 --> 50:03.460]  So that was something I learned.
[50:03.560 --> 50:05.780]  I didn't know people actually thought that demons were walking around.
[50:06.580 --> 50:07.400]  My last one.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.100]  Wait, how though?
[50:09.680 --> 50:11.180]  How did you not think people believe that?
[50:11.920 --> 50:14.180]  I guess I just am not a religious person.
[50:14.400 --> 50:17.980]  And I sort of understand the I guess it's sort of like Santa Claus to me
[50:17.980 --> 50:20.880]  where I get the concept of believing in the idea,
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.160]  but not necessarily the literal symbolism of it.
[50:24.420 --> 50:28.820]  Taking it literally and taking it like in a spiritual sense,
[50:28.820 --> 50:31.160]  I think, in my mind are very separate things.
[50:31.440 --> 50:34.440]  So where would demons sit between the Easter Bunny and God?
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.220]  Uh, somewhere below, I believe.
[50:38.300 --> 50:41.060]  Right. Logistically, this is the hell thing.
[50:41.920 --> 50:42.440]  Logistically?
[50:43.220 --> 50:47.460]  Wait, isn't the Easter Bunny God or something that's tied to religion in some way?
[50:48.040 --> 50:50.120]  Yeah. And what do you mean by that?
[50:50.640 --> 50:54.320]  I mean that I've seen Greg the bunny and there is a thing
[50:54.320 --> 51:00.860]  where the the vampire was in a UFO and he was like Easter Day.
[51:00.980 --> 51:02.660]  This is the only podcast.
[51:03.220 --> 51:04.580]  Talks about Greg the bunny.
[51:05.120 --> 51:09.680]  Is this our second Greg the bunny reference this year?
[51:10.060 --> 51:13.020]  Yes, we have to stop talking about Greg the bunny.
[51:13.440 --> 51:18.320]  And then it was like Conscious Pilot. He's wearing aviator goggles and I don't know.
[51:19.060 --> 51:20.120]  Greg the bunny was pretty good.
[51:20.860 --> 51:24.560]  There are some people who cannot exist in the world
[51:24.560 --> 51:28.480]  unless they find something to be terrified of and to hate.
[51:28.480 --> 51:32.820]  And they look for demons under every pillow and corner of their lives.
[51:33.140 --> 51:33.940]  It's sad.
[51:34.680 --> 51:35.780]  I just look for them in Doom.
[51:36.480 --> 51:37.440]  It's a good time with that.
[51:38.580 --> 51:40.700]  Cool music and shoot some guns.
[51:41.620 --> 51:43.220]  Anyway, bear disease.
[51:44.460 --> 51:46.160]  Bart the bear died of cancer.
[51:46.320 --> 51:48.420]  I didn't know that that was a thing bears could die of.
[51:49.240 --> 51:50.780]  I didn't realize bears could get cancer.
[51:51.220 --> 51:52.700]  It's just kind of everything, isn't it?
[51:53.240 --> 51:56.860]  There's that popular fact that sharks can't get cancer, right?
[51:57.060 --> 51:57.360]  Really?
[51:57.360 --> 52:01.900]  Which means in my head, I guess most stuff can get cancer.
[52:02.140 --> 52:05.040]  I didn't know that fact. I didn't know that about sharks.
[52:05.620 --> 52:09.060]  Isn't the thing that with sharks is that they could theoretically live forever
[52:09.060 --> 52:11.580]  if they just never caught any shark diseases?
[52:12.080 --> 52:15.000]  Cancer being one that they can't get, but there are other diseases they can get.
[52:15.560 --> 52:18.500]  I also heard if you turn one upside down, it goes to sleep.
[52:19.220 --> 52:20.100]  Just like Albert.
[52:24.180 --> 52:28.380]  Yeah, I guess. How many, like, can a slug get cancer?
[52:29.040 --> 52:30.640]  I don't know. I assume so.
[52:31.360 --> 52:32.980]  Based on Bart getting cancer.
[52:33.260 --> 52:35.360]  Probably doesn't live long enough, you know?
[52:36.060 --> 52:37.580]  How long does a slug live?
[52:39.420 --> 52:41.600]  Let's all take guesses before I look it up.
[52:42.340 --> 52:45.140]  I'm going to say one month.
[52:45.680 --> 52:46.440]  OK, Gavin.
[52:47.080 --> 52:47.680]  Two year slug.
[52:48.180 --> 52:49.640]  Two year slug. And the other two?
[52:50.220 --> 52:52.380]  Eighteen months is going to be my guess for a slug.
[52:54.020 --> 52:55.580]  Nick's already on vacation.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.440]  Are you playing GTA right now?
[52:58.760 --> 52:59.640]  Are you playing GTA?
[53:00.300 --> 53:01.540]  How long does a slug live?
[53:02.240 --> 53:04.840]  Slugs typically live for six to eighteen months,
[53:04.940 --> 53:07.220]  but some species can live longer, up to three to four years.
[53:07.540 --> 53:10.140]  So I think Eric and Gavin are both pretty dead on.
[53:10.220 --> 53:10.980]  We're slug experts.
[53:11.700 --> 53:16.060]  I wonder if a slug that's been alive for four years
[53:16.060 --> 53:20.720]  is considered like a wizened old elder slug to the younger slugs.
[53:20.980 --> 53:24.480]  And they they just sit around like slug campfires and listen to stories.
[53:24.860 --> 53:26.420]  They go and visit it in the slug cave.
[53:30.420 --> 53:34.860]  I feel like animal lifespans are so often left out of animal facts.
[53:35.660 --> 53:37.900]  That's what that's a really good point.
[53:38.240 --> 53:39.940]  Like, I don't know how long a bat lives.
[53:41.020 --> 53:41.520]  Which version?
[53:42.500 --> 53:42.700]  What?
[53:43.140 --> 53:44.260]  Which version of a bat?
[53:44.840 --> 53:45.100]  Oh.
[53:45.100 --> 53:47.860]  Bats typically live between 10 and 20 years in the wild,
[53:47.980 --> 53:49.580]  but some species can live for 30 years.
[53:50.100 --> 53:50.380]  Shit.
[53:51.020 --> 53:58.200]  The longest lived bat on record was a male Brant's myotis bat that lived to be 41 years old.
[53:58.520 --> 54:01.420]  So there could be a bat alive right now from the 80s?
[54:02.700 --> 54:04.840]  Yeah, probably not a lot of them, one or two.
[54:05.760 --> 54:07.560]  It'd be cool if you could if there was a website
[54:07.560 --> 54:10.540]  that told you all the animals that were older than you right now.
[54:12.500 --> 54:14.960]  Oh, things I could learn from an elder bat.
[54:15.100 --> 54:18.840]  I think you'd be mostly like crabs and tortoises, wouldn't it?
[54:19.460 --> 54:19.660]  Yeah.
[54:19.680 --> 54:21.760]  What is the oldest animal alive right now?
[54:21.860 --> 54:22.280]  Let's see.
[54:22.840 --> 54:23.440]  I'm going to guess like a tree.
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.300]  I don't want to go to this beach.
[54:24.420 --> 54:26.000]  Bunch of old ass crabs live here.
[54:26.480 --> 54:28.320]  Boomer Beach is what I call this place.
[54:28.680 --> 54:31.520]  That's got to be like a 250 year old tortoise somewhere.
[54:32.220 --> 54:36.560]  According to Google AI, the oldest living animal on Earth is currently
[54:36.560 --> 54:41.680]  Jonathan the Seychelles giant tortoise, estimated to be around 192 years old.
[54:42.260 --> 54:42.700]  Damn!
[54:42.940 --> 54:43.580]  I would have thought older.
[54:45.100 --> 54:47.840]  Well, they say he was born around 1832.
[54:49.600 --> 54:52.140]  Fuck, dude, I bet that I bet that dude's got some stories.
[54:53.480 --> 54:54.580]  They're all slow, though.
[54:57.580 --> 54:57.940]  Christ.
[55:00.160 --> 55:01.960]  I was thinking about animals the other day.
[55:02.800 --> 55:03.420]  What were you thinking about animals?
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.660]  I wasn't sure if I was going to bring this up to you guys,
[55:05.680 --> 55:08.200]  because it wasn't a fully formed thought yet.
[55:08.560 --> 55:08.920]  Let's form it.
[55:09.240 --> 55:11.960]  Here's what I have written down, and you guys can go from here.
[55:12.560 --> 55:15.300]  Do you guys know how ants are organized and coordinated?
[55:15.880 --> 55:16.440]  Yes.
[55:17.000 --> 55:17.820]  Yeah, they're units.
[55:18.460 --> 55:20.100]  What if other animals were like that?
[55:20.560 --> 55:21.360]  Oh, it's terrifying.
[55:21.840 --> 55:22.620]  It's terrifying, right?
[55:22.640 --> 55:30.260]  Like if birds behaved like ants or hedgehogs or raccoons behaved like ants,
[55:30.420 --> 55:31.700]  that would be terrifying.
[55:32.240 --> 55:35.360]  Isn't a swarm of birds pretty organized?
[55:36.180 --> 55:41.500]  Yeah, but like all they do is they fly organized and like they go from place to place.
[55:41.500 --> 55:44.940]  They're not like getting fry bags as a crew.
[55:45.440 --> 55:54.900]  They're not lining up in a mile long line and then like taking one piece of sugar cube
[55:54.900 --> 55:59.080]  and handing it to the next guy and just going down the line over and over again.
[55:59.520 --> 56:00.080]  You know what I mean?
[56:00.140 --> 56:04.860]  Or they're not tackling problems in that way.
[56:04.920 --> 56:10.980]  Like you see ants that'll like build an ant bridge to a piece of food that's like precarious.
[56:10.980 --> 56:13.440]  You're not seeing birds build bird bridges, you know, or you don't see,
[56:13.560 --> 56:16.040]  I don't know, dogs build dog bridges.
[56:16.500 --> 56:16.840]  No.
[56:17.340 --> 56:22.660]  I just think that we're lucky that other animals aren't as coordinated as ants are.
[56:23.340 --> 56:27.020]  If dogs are like cats got organized, they could take over cities instantly.
[56:27.300 --> 56:28.440]  100 percent. 100 percent.
[56:28.720 --> 56:29.300]  What's that like?
[56:29.360 --> 56:29.880]  That's the thing.
[56:29.980 --> 56:30.160]  It's too.
[56:30.240 --> 56:30.760]  It's like ants.
[56:31.880 --> 56:32.340]  Cool.
[56:32.700 --> 56:33.780]  I'm not too worried about ants.
[56:33.820 --> 56:34.920]  I can eliminate ants.
[56:35.060 --> 56:39.500]  But how much bigger does the organism have to get before it becomes scary?
[56:39.500 --> 56:44.140]  Like if you saw, I don't know, 500 cockroaches in unison doing ant stuff.
[56:44.220 --> 56:44.900]  Oh my God.
[56:45.020 --> 56:45.960]  That might be scary.
[56:46.320 --> 56:48.020]  You see 500 ants, you don't think twice.
[56:48.100 --> 56:49.520]  You see 500 cockroaches in unison.
[56:49.640 --> 56:53.420]  You might, you probably, uh, probably need to have yourself,
[56:53.520 --> 56:55.340]  think you'd be like, I need, probably need to be evaluated.
[56:55.460 --> 56:56.840]  I'm clearly losing my mind.
[56:57.080 --> 56:58.160]  Same with like flies.
[56:58.820 --> 56:59.720]  Oh, Jesus.
[56:59.980 --> 57:01.720]  You just start looking for a body.
[57:02.320 --> 57:06.140]  Like flies marching in an order or flying in a single file line.
[57:06.300 --> 57:06.780]  You know what I mean?
[57:06.780 --> 57:11.440]  I wonder how many mosquitoes it would take to drain somebody of blood fully.
[57:11.440 --> 57:12.400]  Dear God.
[57:12.480 --> 57:13.380]  I bet the internet knows.
[57:13.480 --> 57:13.800]  Hold on.
[57:14.660 --> 57:16.400]  How many mos...
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.680]  Like if there was like a wave of mosquitoes and you just got bit like 10,
[57:21.020 --> 57:22.100]  like it would be way more than that.
[57:22.160 --> 57:23.600]  Let's say like a hundred thousand times.
[57:23.920 --> 57:26.320]  Would it look like a big blob of red flying off into the distance?
[57:26.620 --> 57:27.740]  I have an answer.
[57:28.600 --> 57:29.460]  Oh, what, really?
[57:30.140 --> 57:33.740]  Anybody want to take a guess on how many mosquitoes it takes to drain a human of blood?
[57:33.900 --> 57:35.740]  Dude, I just wouldn't even know where to start.
[57:35.740 --> 57:37.340]  I'm going to say 4 billion.
[57:38.020 --> 57:38.460]  Okay.
[57:39.120 --> 57:39.720]  10 million.
[57:40.620 --> 57:42.940]  Millie, I'm going to guess 45,000.
[57:43.740 --> 57:44.660]  What are we doing here?
[57:45.380 --> 57:49.400]  Dude, I think it's, I think it's got to be somewhere like, like 90.
[57:49.520 --> 57:50.820]  I mean, like really doubling up on Gavin.
[57:50.900 --> 57:52.080]  I think it's gonna be like 90,000.
[57:52.940 --> 57:54.260]  You guys are shooting a little low.
[57:54.380 --> 57:57.920]  It would take approximately 1.2 million mosquitoes
[57:57.920 --> 58:00.720]  to completely drain the average human of their blood.
[58:00.720 --> 58:07.520]  A single mosquito can consume about 0.005 millimeters of blood.
[58:07.980 --> 58:09.900]  But the average human has about five liters.
[58:10.220 --> 58:13.280]  But if I, if I splat a mosquito and a bunch of blood goes,
[58:13.820 --> 58:16.800]  are you saying I could have a million splats worth of blood?
[58:17.460 --> 58:19.460]  Well, you'd be pretty weak before.
[58:19.700 --> 58:22.620]  Yeah, you'd probably, probably at around 500,000.
[58:22.700 --> 58:27.620]  You'd start to, you'd probably, you'd probably get pretty tired and do a little less splatting.
[58:28.040 --> 58:31.160]  The only thing I know is it takes 10,000 bee stings to kill a man.
[58:32.220 --> 58:33.440]  It's a firm fact right there.
[58:33.640 --> 58:34.120]  10,000.
[58:34.480 --> 58:36.420]  Tell that to Macaulay Culkin and my girl.
[58:37.140 --> 58:38.020]  Oh, he had an allergy.
[58:38.500 --> 58:41.100]  I was referencing Bear Volleyball.
[58:41.220 --> 58:41.800]  Jackass thing.
[58:42.500 --> 58:42.940]  Oh, yeah.
[58:43.120 --> 58:46.980]  They have like 100,000 bees and their animal experts like takes 10,000.
[58:47.360 --> 58:49.340]  I mean, Dave Ingham's like, what are we doing here?
[58:51.060 --> 58:54.800]  We've got 10 times as many as he just said it takes to kill somebody.
[59:00.390 --> 59:01.330]  I would be.
[59:02.370 --> 59:05.730]  I think the mosquitoes, I don't like mosquitoes.
[59:06.310 --> 59:07.190]  That'd be a lot, but ants.
[59:07.570 --> 59:07.990]  Who does?
[59:08.090 --> 59:08.910]  Ants would be a problem too.
[59:09.110 --> 59:10.230]  Who likes mosquitoes?
[59:10.410 --> 59:11.350]  Who's pro mosquito?
[59:11.810 --> 59:14.450]  You said that like it was going to be a controversial take.
[59:15.010 --> 59:16.210]  It was a game.
[59:16.330 --> 59:17.350]  They made a game for it.
[59:17.370 --> 59:18.990]  There are people that like being mosquitoes.
[59:19.670 --> 59:20.270]  Mosquito heads out there.
[59:20.430 --> 59:22.610]  I'm on the record as saying I don't like mosquitoes.
[59:23.190 --> 59:24.330]  Sorry if that's controversial.
[59:24.810 --> 59:27.350]  That's why I think it could be fun, though, if they coordinate like ants,
[59:27.350 --> 59:31.470]  if you have enough of them is imagine like waking up and your bed is in a different place.
[59:31.490 --> 59:34.370]  Like they lifted your bed because they're strong as a unit.
[59:34.610 --> 59:35.970]  Sounds scary as hell.
[59:36.390 --> 59:36.710]  Yeah.
[59:36.870 --> 59:41.710]  You just travel places, save on gas, just get a bunch to lift the car.
[59:41.890 --> 59:47.310]  And I mean, now we're kind of getting into grounded territory or like I want to be able to control.
[59:47.470 --> 59:51.370]  I guess this is like probably a Marvin villain, a Marvel Marvin.
[59:53.130 --> 59:53.930]  Marvin comics.
[59:53.930 --> 59:58.650]  Ah, it would be a Marvin comics is an idea not good enough for Marvel.
[59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.130]  It's the knockoff offshoot Marvin comics.
[01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:06.430]  The ant, the ant mega, mega ant.
[01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.430]  What would it be?
[01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:08.670]  What would the villain name be?
[01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.550]  Guy who tries to control the ants with his mind.
[01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.810]  Ant man.
[01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.890]  But that's already exists.
[01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:16.850]  But you want the knockoff.
[01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.090]  He's friends with Mrs. Miss Bob.
[01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.910]  Who's the knockoff Paul Rudd?
[01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.870]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.690]  Who is the knockoff Paul Rudd?
[01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:24.930]  Uh.
[01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:26.630]  I don't know.
[01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:28.190]  Nobody comes to mind for me.
[01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.990]  Yeah, no.
[01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:30.270]  Very specific guy.
[01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:34.290]  Who is the guy that played Gambit in Wolverine Origins?
[01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.550]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:37.770]  Who's Channing Tatum?
[01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.010]  No, no.
[01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:39.890]  Taylor Kitsch.
[01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:40.970]  Taylor Kitsch.
[01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.970]  Also the Star Battleship.
[01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:46.590]  Yes, Star.
[01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:47.870]  Star Battleship.
[01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:49.370]  Never saw that one.
[01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.530]  Was that the was Rihanna in that movie?
[01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:52.950]  She was.
[01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:53.590]  That's about the thing.
[01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:57.230]  I wonder what Rihanna's film career looks like, because I know she was in Battleship
[01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:01.790]  and she's in the Smurfs movie that comes out, which everybody should see, by the way.
[01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.870]  Need that movie to make about $350 million.
[01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:05.410]  She's in.
[01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.190]  This is the end.
[01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:09.890]  I don't think I could name another Rihanna movie, which is sort of surprising.
[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:13.010]  I feel like she's probably been in or maybe she stopped.
[01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:17.770]  Maybe she made Battleship was like, I got all I need from this acting experience for a little while.
[01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:20.030]  Let's see.
[01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.810]  Oh, she was in some other big hitters.
[01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:27.150]  She was in Valerian in the city of a thousand whatever planets.
[01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:30.270]  Oh, weird.
[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:34.470]  Battleship to Valerian is such an interesting one deal.
[01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:40.630]  She was in a lot of a lot of Oceans 8.
[01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:41.550]  She was in.
[01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:42.570]  Oh, I didn't see that one.
[01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:43.730]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:45.110]  Bates Motel.
[01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:46.750]  She was in two episodes.
[01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:51.470]  Do you think we could do a draft of movie directors who forgot how to make movies?
[01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.510]  Oh, that's very specific.
[01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:58.830]  Going from Fifth Element to Valerian would be on my list.
[01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:05.830]  Or like directors who made good movies and then disappeared and just didn't make anything else,
[01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:11.370]  like Tobe Hooper made two of my favorite movies and then disappeared.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:13.870]  Tobe.
[01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:15.570]  Tobe Hooper?
[01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:16.930]  You don't know him?
[01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.730]  No.
[01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.210]  He's the guy that directed the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
[01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.350]  Oh.
[01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:27.330]  And then he he also directed a movie called Invaders from Mars.
[01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.470]  That is one of my favorite movies of all time.
[01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:30.890]  80s like kids horror movie.
[01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:32.230]  Oh, that's fun.
[01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.550]  Yeah, it is fun.
[01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:33.890]  It's awesome.
[01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:35.470]  What's the name of the saw guy?
[01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.850]  Isn't he like Tobe Hooper or something?
[01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.570]  Guy that plays Jigsaw.
[01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.790]  Tobin Bell.
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:42.770]  Tobin Bell.
[01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.610]  I know I know there is a Tobin there.
[01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:46.650]  Good pull, Nick.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.770]  Thank you.
[01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.530]  That's redemption for the slug right there.
[01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:50.590]  Pulling Tobin Bell.
[01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:52.810]  Slug redemption.
[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.230]  I, uh, I want to watch Changing Alliance.
[01:02:59.010 --> 01:02:59.970]  I just watched The Edge.
[01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.890]  I have a list of movies.
[01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:04.550]  That's why I watched The Edge.
[01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.170]  Guys, guys, I want to watch Changing Alliance.
[01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:09.170]  Well, let me explain.
[01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:12.190]  I have a list of movies and The Edge was one of them.
[01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.530]  Were there movie store movies where I've never heard anyone talk about them?
[01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:18.950]  I've just seen the poster a lot and I don't know anyone who's seen them.
[01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:21.110]  I've never heard any discourse around them.
[01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:23.010]  And Changing Lanes is one of those for me.
[01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.390]  Don't know what it's about.
[01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.450]  Don't know anyone who's seen it.
[01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.790]  Have never heard anybody talk about it.
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:34.130]  Feels like it could be a fake movie, but I've seen it so many times that that poster.
[01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:35.550]  That's all I know.
[01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:36.830]  It's a Ben Affleck movie, right?
[01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:37.390]  Oh, yeah, there you go.
[01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:38.750]  Ben Affleck, Samuel Jackson.
[01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.390]  They're probably changing lanes.
[01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:43.890]  I don't know anything else about it, but I'm excited to watch it.
[01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:46.950]  It's been my my recent how I've been watching movies.
[01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:51.410]  The Edge was a similar thing of like, I know bears involved, but that's all I know.
[01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:52.630]  I don't know what this is.
[01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:58.410]  Similarly, I stumbled into a movie that I'm going to watch called Death Valley
[01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:00.450]  that I just bought on Blu-ray.
[01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:01.370]  Okay.
[01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:09.610]  And it stars a young Peter Billingsley before he was in.
[01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:10.890]  I'm assuming it was before.
[01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.370]  Hold on, let me I'm trying to find the poster.
[01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:14.130]  What is this movie?
[01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.710]  Death Valley.
[01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.270]  Has anyone seen Changing Lanes?
[01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.170]  Well, you're pulling that up.
[01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:19.110]  No, no, no.
[01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.910]  See, nobody's seen this fucking movie.
[01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.810]  No, but it was all I know about it.
[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:24.150]  I've just never, you know, I've never seen it.
[01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:25.310]  Weird.
[01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:27.490]  What's your Death Valley about?
[01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.090]  So it's Peter Billingsley.
[01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.650]  He's a young kid.
[01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:34.010]  He's imagine him a little bit younger than in his role in A Christmas Story.
[01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:37.590]  He he lives with his dad, like in New York.
[01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:41.570]  I'm just going off the trailer and his mom remarries or has a new boyfriend
[01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:45.170]  and he has to go spend a vacation with his mom and her new boyfriend.
[01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.070]  And it's like.
[01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:51.350]  Billy thought the worst thing he would do today would be to say goodbye to his father
[01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:55.030]  or maybe having to get to know his mother's new boyfriend.
[01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.830]  But the worst thing he's going to have to do today is survive.
[01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.850]  And then it's up.
[01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:03.530]  He and his mom and his mom's boyfriend go to Death Valley on a vacation.
[01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.350]  To drive, I don't know, just driving through nothing in Death Valley,
[01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:11.710]  but a serial killer latches onto them and chases them down and tries to kill them.
[01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:14.390]  And it's all about Peter Billingsley at like eight years old,
[01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:16.250]  running from a serial killer in the desert.
[01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:19.350]  Isn't that where the Undertaker's from? Death Valley?
[01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.630]  I believe so. Yeah.
[01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:24.210]  Again, for all I know, for all I know, he's the serial killer.
[01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:25.030]  I haven't seen it yet.
[01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:26.350]  But I hope he saves them.
[01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.890]  The tagline is not even a scream escape.
[01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.670]  So that's pretty cool.
[01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:33.870]  So maybe while you watch Changing Lanes, I'll watch my Blu-ray of Death Valley.
[01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.830]  Ah shit, what dog shit should I watch?
[01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.150]  Do you not have movies that you've seen posters of, Gavin,
[01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:42.110]  that you just like you don't know anything about?
[01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.290]  The Klumps.
[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:46.410]  The Klumps is a great one.
[01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:47.490]  It's a great one.
[01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.390]  You should watch The Klumps.
[01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:51.210]  Oh man, really?
[01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.130]  I don't want to watch The Klumps.
[01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.410]  You said it, dude.
[01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:57.430]  You said it, man.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.170]  It's too late.
[01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:59.810]  You brought it up.
[01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.990]  Oh, what about Sliding Doors?
[01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:02.970]  Has anyone seen that?
[01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.570]  I don't even know what Sliding Doors is.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.630]  No, I don't think I've seen Sliding Doors.
[01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:08.050]  That was Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:09.730]  It's Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:13.190]  And it's like a whole thing where like if she if she got on the train,
[01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:14.370]  her life would have been different.
[01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:15.490]  And then she dies or something.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.450]  She'd like be a brunette, I think is like the difference.
[01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:19.710]  Like she had a different haircut.
[01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:25.230]  See, to me, Sliding Doors is like a changing lanes ass type of movie name.
[01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:26.690]  Yes, that's what I thought.
[01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:33.850]  Do you think that Eddie Murphy had like one bad, one bad movie with a co-star?
[01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:36.770]  Like he had one bad experience and it was like never again
[01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:39.170]  and just decided that he would be all of his co-stars.
[01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:44.030]  It's such a weird thing that he has so many movies where he's playing
[01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:46.330]  like all nine of the characters that are in.
[01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:47.770]  When did he first do it?
[01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:49.790]  Was it coming to America?
[01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.010]  Probably coming to America.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:58.170]  I assumed he was like, if I don't cast anybody else in this film,
[01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:59.930]  I can keep all the extra money.
[01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:04.270]  If I play every character, I'll just I'll just be I'll just get.
[01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:07.470]  Yeah, I'm just going to get I'm just gonna pay myself for each role I'm in.
[01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:09.370]  What if it was like an all time scam
[01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:12.830]  where they didn't know it was him playing all the roles when they hired him?
[01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:16.470]  Like the casting director just thought he was meeting six different actors.
[01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:20.330]  And the studio was like, wow, you got a lot of new people we've never heard of in this movie.
[01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.330]  Eddie Murphy really trying to bring new people in.
[01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:26.950]  We're giving out a lot of SAG cards, it looks like in this thing.
[01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:28.930]  And it's just him.
[01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:31.170]  He's in SAG eight times.
[01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.370]  I'd like to imagine it continued off screen
[01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:40.290]  or like he had a chef character he would play and he'd make the meals.
[01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.650]  Like it's just Eddie Murphy profiting every way he can.
[01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:45.510]  He's taking every job.
[01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:51.050]  I would love to know if if Eddie Murphy ever dreams about other people he's played.
[01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:54.250]  Or does he like he's he is those people?
[01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:55.150]  Yeah.
[01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:01.830]  I want to see a remake in the movie Identity, but with the cast of the clumps.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:11.100]  I want all the alternate personalities to just be clumps characters.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:17.080]  Is the original Nutty Professor, are they called the clumps in that?
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.520]  I don't know.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.540]  I think I watched it as a child and I don't remember anything about it.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.560]  I mean, like the the old old one.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.960]  Oh, the original, not his first.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.080]  Yeah, because I assume he was still a clump in the first one.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.120]  But was the original character the clump?
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.140]  Yeah, but do you think the clumps were in the first one?
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.080]  Or do you think they brought the clumps in for the second?
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.100]  I mean, he was a clump, wasn't he?
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.720]  Wasn't he always a clump?
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:47.500]  I'm assuming he was always a clump, but I'm curious if this cast of characters were in the first.
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.280]  If he's a clump, he's got to come from a line of clumps.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.620]  He definitely will.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.680]  But I was curious if the line of clumps was in the first or if we're getting introduced
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.400]  to all these clumps in the second.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.940]  I'm pretty sure that a lot of the clumps are in the first one.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.620]  Then why make...
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:06.660]  I don't...
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.280]  I mean, I haven't seen the Nutty Professor.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.100]  Just feels like a weird thing to be like, you know what?
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.320]  The second thing, we're going to make a sequel.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.720]  And instead of it being like about goofy science, let's focus in on the clumps.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.780]  I think that people really want some clumps in their life.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.480]  Jerry Lewis's name in the first Nutty Professor is Professor Julius Kelp.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.300]  So the sequel would have been the Kelps.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.400]  Yeah, so he went from kelp to clump.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.240]  They modernized it.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.580]  His alternate ego is buddy love.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.040]  That's why he's the cool guy.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.460]  Well, he's buddy love in the new one, too.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:36.840]  But...
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:38.920]  So you've seen it.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.060]  I've seen the first clump.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.500]  I've seen the first Nutty Professor.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.060]  I've seen the first clump!
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.440]  I've seen the first clump!
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:50.120]  I've seen OG clump, where he's buddy love.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.060]  And then I've never seen...
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.300]  You've never seen OOG kelp.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.700]  I've never seen kelp and I've never seen Nutty Professor 2, the clumps.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.900]  Would you rather watch Nutty Professor 2, the clumps,
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.640]  or the original Nutty Professor starring Jerry Lewis?
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.040]  The original Nutty Professor.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.280]  Well, maybe that should be the movie you watch.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.860]  Eric's gonna watch Sliding Doors.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.820]  You're gonna watch Nutty Professor.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.560]  I didn't say I wanted to watch Sliding...
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.000]  I don't want to watch Sliding Doors.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.960]  Why do I have to watch Sliding Doors?
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:16.820]  Because you posted it.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.320]  And then Nick's gonna watch something, too.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.460]  Nick, what are you gonna watch?
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:20.940]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.020]  You remember your bitchin' about watching Sliding Doors?
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.480]  That was a well-reviewed movie.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.040]  That's gonna be the...
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.320]  I wasn't the one who brought it up!
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.460]  I brought up Sliding Doors.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.040]  What? I didn't have anything!
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.100]  I posted the picture!
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.920]  I posted pictures of a bear!
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.820]  I posted changing lanes!
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.160]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.260]  Picture posting is nine-tenths of the law.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]  Oh my god.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.600]  Did they do a Nutty Professor 3?
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.660]  Did we ever see the clumps again?
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.380]  I think we need to get the clumps back.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.260]  I can't believe you never saw the first one.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.760]  I feel like every kid rented that for a birthday.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.080]  I think I may have seen it in theaters as a kid, but I don't remember about it.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.760]  Did they have toys for the Nutty Professor?
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.860]  I feel like I may have got a Happy Meal toy or a Burger King toy for them.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.060]  Do you remember a bit where he's massive and he farts and there's an explosion?
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.340]  No.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.460]  He's like the size of a building.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.920]  That might have been a dream sequence.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:15.900]  It's a dream sequence.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.940]  I'm not sure that was canon to the story.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:18.260]  No.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.160]  I don't...
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:21.760]  Yeah, I can't...
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.900]  I don't have any memories of the Nutty Professor.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.640]  Oh my god.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.200]  Oh my god.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.380]  I have to take a shit.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.220]  Then let's end this. Wrap up.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.100]  I keep sending a message to wrap up. I keep saying it.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.480]  Yeah, but this isn't right.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.680]  I've taken five shits today already.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.800]  Oh, that's...
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.100]  Uh-oh.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.220]  How do I have to take a sixth shit?
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:40.900]  It's what...
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.900]  It's 1.16 in the afternoon.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.960]  Yeah, road trip.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.900]  You get travel butt sometimes.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.540]  Yeah, but it didn't hit me till today.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.060]  I got home at noon yesterday.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.000]  Speaking of which, I had a really good time driving from Austin to Michigan.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.220]  That's not a bad drive.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.880]  I mean, it's like a two-day drive, but...
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.500]  I will say this.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.100]  Little Rock, Arkansas and Texarkana are dog shit.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.980]  No offense to anybody who lives there.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.220]  But man, not great places to hang out.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.620]  Is there a Little Rock in Little Rock?
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.140]  Like there is a Round Rock in Round Rock that isn't that real?
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.020]  Is there a Little Rock that isn't that little?
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.000]  Name a place that doesn't have a Little Rock.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:18.700]  Mars.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:19.760]  Oh, that's a bad one.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.560]  Is there a Little Rock in Round Rock?
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.680]  Guys, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.880]  As we go out, we're going to learn a little bit about the Little Rock.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:32.800]  Little Rock.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:39.940]  It is a now reduced stone outcrop projecting in the Arkansas River from its south bank
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.520]  in the city's waterfront area adjacent to Junction Bridge.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.100]  I think I was actually by Junction Bridge.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.020]  Whose foundations include a portion of the rock.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.480]  Yeah, so I guess it's kind of gone.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.380]  But there is a bronze plaque mounted on it.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.240]  Hell yeah.
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:55.340]  The original rock was 18 feet above the river.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.480]  We should buy one of those rest in peace benches, but just put the clumps on it.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.740]  What do you mean put the clumps on it?
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.500]  Just write the clumps.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.400]  I think I just think it's funny that there's a clumps bench.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.640]  That just makes me happy.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.740]  The premise that like you sit at a bench and you're like,
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.560]  Oh, who is this in dedication to?
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.500]  Oh, the clumps?
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.620]  So you want to dedicate just a bench in.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.440]  But does it have to be in Little Rock?
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.680]  A Little Rock could be anywhere.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:25.760]  It doesn't even have to be a legal bench.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.880]  We could just put a bench somewhere that says the clumps on.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.080]  Ain't nobody stopping benches.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.100]  I feel like we should just put all these dogshit movies on a wheel and watch one of them.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.280]  We could end up watching the clumps.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.600]  Why? We can't even finish Charmed.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.980]  Yeah, well, maybe after we finish Charmed, we could do that.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.820]  If somebody would let us finish it.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.320]  You're real worked up about watching more Charmed.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.020]  I don't think that's the reason we're worked up, bud.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.960]  You're acting like episode three is coming out next week.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.880]  I can't figure out, honestly.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.240]  Maybe you guys can help me out here as we as we end this episode.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:07.200]  I can't figure out if Gavin is rescheduling Charmed episode three because of
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.660]  just scheduling issues or because he can't bring himself to watch any more of it.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.500]  And he just needs a buffer.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.680]  Well, let me let me tell you something that might blow your mind.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.940]  I had a really good time making Wheel of Decades.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.700]  I enjoyed it.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.820]  I enjoyed the hell out of it, but nobody else seemed to in the process of it.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:39.100]  All right, well, let's go ahead and take old Yeller back around the barn and
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.520]  put a bullet in its head.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.500]  It's got mange and rabies and well, I spoiled it for you, unfortunately.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:48.000]  Oh, we're going to have to put it down.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.840]  Much like episode sixty four of the Regulation podcast.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.220]  It is in the ground.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.500]  We are throwing dirt over it.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.840]  There's some old ladies crying in the corner.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.600]  There's Vaseline everywhere.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:04.000]  The dirt is covered in Vaseline and you'll be covered in Vaseline, too.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.860]  And, Glory, if you tune in next week for episode sixty five of the Regulation podcast,
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:09.820]  don't forget we have a Patreon.

[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.420]  I just want to see him get it right once.
