[00:30.040 --> 00:34.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey,
[00:35.040 --> 00:41.380]  and with me, as always, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour, Gavin Free, and Andrew Patton. It is 2025,
[00:42.220 --> 00:47.200]  boys. Oh my god. It's probably been 2025 for a little bit since we recorded this early,
[00:47.580 --> 00:53.600]  but this is the first time I've talked to you all in about 10... well, aside from spam texting and
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.120]  slacking you all work ideas and stuff over the last week. It's the first time I've talked to
[00:57.120 --> 01:02.360]  you guys this year. How's everybody doing? I'm sick, but I'm good. Good. How are you?
[01:03.100 --> 01:08.040]  Well, I'm not sick. Uh, I'm good. Yeah. What's wrong with you? I just have like a
[01:08.500 --> 01:12.880]  cold or like chest infection or something, but I'm good. How about the other two?
[01:13.960 --> 01:19.760]  I'm muted so we can sync. I just, it was, it was just like, yeah, I mean, we can, we can sync. We
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.220]  can just go. I thought we were fine. I wouldn't worry about it. We can do like a tail sync,
[01:24.220 --> 01:29.980]  but also let's go ahead and sink. All right. Let's go ahead and go ahead and sink Andrew.
[01:31.380 --> 01:38.880]  I was getting five, four, three, two, one. Do you think that just, do you think that stays
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.100]  in? Like that's how the episode goes? Yeah. Remind somebody, remind me at the end to tell
[01:45.100 --> 01:48.720]  you a funny, a funny little thing that just happened, but not till, not till the end of
[01:48.720 --> 01:53.520]  the episode. I said, I was getting there when I clicked mute. I was like, who am I? I'm not
[01:53.520 --> 01:58.240]  talking to anyone. Uh, all right. Let me start. Let me go back. Let me roll back. What about the
[01:58.240 --> 02:05.740]  other two? How were your, how was your holiday? Bloody lovely. Nice. Wow. What made it so lovely?
[02:06.380 --> 02:12.840]  Oh, new year, new me. Uh, I've decided instead of 2% milk, I'm a 1% guy now. That's about it.
[02:14.560 --> 02:20.060]  Why? You just want watery milk? Uh, I just can't really taste the difference when it's in a,
[02:20.060 --> 02:25.080]  a lovely little cap. Oh, well, there you go. Oh, Nick says he's still in whole milk.
[02:26.020 --> 02:33.400]  Wow. You're, you're putting 1% milk in like espresso. Yeah. Is that wrong?
[02:34.500 --> 02:41.000]  I mean, I don't know that it's right. It just, that seems like not enough fat to get. You might
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.520]  as well just be putting, you might as well. You're honestly, you're like a step away from drinking an
[02:44.520 --> 02:50.700]  Americano, man. You're really close. And that's, and then that is really close to having a London
[02:50.700 --> 02:55.120]  fog or whatever Nick's pick was. So I'm just saying, be careful, tread lightly in 2025.
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.900]  Should we do a blind taste test with a hundred people? One is a 1% cappuccino and one is an
[03:00.900 --> 03:05.720]  Americano. Let's see if they can tell the difference. Yeah. You may not have been
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.780]  able to tell the difference, Gavin, but we've all noticed a difference in you. So it's okay.
[03:10.900 --> 03:17.980]  It's been a change. We did a heist today and we kind of came clean to Gavin that we were worried
[03:17.980 --> 03:23.820]  about his oxygen intake again, because he's just, it's been a lot of Gavin saying something,
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.580]  getting confused about what he's saying and then saying what. The audience has definitely noticed
[03:29.580 --> 03:34.500]  it. Yeah. Thankfully they're just like, no, it's fine. He's just aging, which I think, you know,
[03:35.020 --> 03:41.380]  I definitely am in a mental decline. Dude, it's, it's real. It's only going to get worse
[03:41.380 --> 03:49.540]  once it starts. I can't remember shit about shit. It sucks. I see this completely lovingly, Gavin.
[03:49.780 --> 03:54.300]  Gavin did something so stupid in a recording we did recently. Oh, this is, this is good. Cause
[03:54.300 --> 04:01.020]  one of my notes today is, uh, defend myself. That's his new year's resolution. I'm not taking
[04:01.020 --> 04:06.980]  shit from you people. It's 1% milk. It's self-defense. I gotta make a note. Make sure
[04:06.980 --> 04:12.440]  to bring up on the podcast, defend myself. Cause Andrew yesterday said, I'm going to,
[04:12.500 --> 04:15.960]  I'm going to make a note about this. And I just wrote my own note. Defend self.
[04:16.200 --> 04:22.640]  What I'm about to say has nothing to do with that. I only said that to put you in defensive mode.
[04:23.960 --> 04:31.620]  Defend myself again. This is unrelated. Yeah. This is a different thing. Gavin did something.
[04:32.020 --> 04:38.920]  We're filming a GTA thing and it was so dumb that I wanted to watch it later. And I realized he
[04:38.920 --> 04:43.500]  didn't upload any of his footage and decided to ask him to upload all of his footage so I could
[04:43.500 --> 04:49.360]  watch his dumb thing. And it brought me so much joy. I watched it, made a note of when it happened
[04:49.360 --> 04:55.420]  in his video file, and then went to his separate audio file to just listen to you trying to do the
[04:55.420 --> 05:02.060]  thing. Get out of my files. You're perverting all my secret files. It was great. It brought me so
[05:02.060 --> 05:09.360]  much joy. You have some oxygen levels you need to fix. You're a digital peeper. This is something
[05:09.360 --> 05:15.960]  you do. You do this, Gavin. It's just happening to you now. He learned from you. Yeah, by watching
[05:15.960 --> 05:21.080]  you. What did I do on? Yeah, what was the thing that he did, Andrew? He had to solve a puzzle
[05:21.080 --> 05:28.100]  and it's a puzzle that I don't think anyone's ever failed fully. That was insane. He failed
[05:28.100 --> 05:33.140]  fully. Well, here's the thing, right? It's process of elimination. So you attach four things to four
[05:33.140 --> 05:37.460]  random other things and you see what sticks. So if one of them is right, oh, you only have to attach
[05:37.460 --> 05:43.100]  three things to three other things. Uh-huh. But I put four in. Yeah. All of them were wrong. Back
[05:43.100 --> 05:49.100]  to square one. I think I did it again and they were all wrong. You did. And then I only had one
[05:49.100 --> 05:53.440]  attempt today to lock me up. No, you didn't. So it was four attempts. And the problem was you did
[05:53.440 --> 05:59.040]  it in such an insane way that you, I think, put one of them in the same place three times in a row.
[05:59.360 --> 06:10.860]  It was insane. Come on. Yeah, it was a huge mistake by Gavin. But yeah. Is this one of the OG
[06:11.460 --> 06:17.260]  heists or is this a DLC heist? Uh, Doomsday. It was part of Doomsday. Yeah, he might have
[06:17.260 --> 06:23.640]  already done this before, too. Oh, he definitely did. 100%. We talked about how he'd done it before
[06:24.080 --> 06:29.720]  and he so fucked it up so bad it blew the whole mission. It was crazy. I think what we could do
[06:29.720 --> 06:34.980]  is play the original time I did it next to this time and see. I bet it took over twice as long.
[06:35.100 --> 06:38.840]  Oh, it'll be so funny to see your original footage. I don't know what to do about it.
[06:39.400 --> 06:43.000]  My windows are open. You know, it's cold out. There's no cats in here.
[06:43.660 --> 06:47.800]  I've got nothing to blame it on other than my own aging head.
[06:50.080 --> 06:54.380]  Maybe you should start taking Prevagen. I see commercials for it on TV. It's supposed
[06:54.380 --> 07:00.660]  to help improve your memory. Oh, it's for old people. I see commercials for it on TV.
[07:02.340 --> 07:04.820]  It's Jeff's doctor recommended advice.
[07:06.580 --> 07:11.160]  It's just everything, everything, all medicine is advertised on TV now and I see this fucking
[07:11.160 --> 07:15.600]  Prevagen ad all the time. It's number one pharmacist recommended supplements for your
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.700]  brain. You see a bunch of old ass people like in their 70s and their 80s. They're like,
[07:19.820 --> 07:22.980]  I can remember to tie my shoes now or whatever. That could be you.
[07:23.320 --> 07:28.280]  That's got a worse name for what it is. It starts with Prevage. It sounds like...
[07:28.280 --> 07:31.800]  I think it's like prevent aging is kind of what they're going for.
[07:33.260 --> 07:37.800]  Oh, that makes total sense. By the way, this is not sponsored by Prevagen. I'm sure that
[07:37.800 --> 07:43.300]  drug is bullshit. That was purely for the comedy. But if Prevagen is listening, we will take your
[07:43.300 --> 07:46.580]  money. I have no problem with that. But if you want to go to the website and enter code FACE
[07:46.580 --> 07:53.520]  for 10% off. FACE! Wow, dude, we're using the old show name on this. Dude, I still,
[07:53.680 --> 07:57.400]  every time I do an ad for fucking regulation, I always have to say FACE for some reason.
[07:57.400 --> 07:59.520]  You might want to start taking Prevagen, man.
[08:02.800 --> 08:05.740]  I'm surprised that they say what it is, because I don't know if it's a Canadian
[08:05.740 --> 08:12.380]  thing with like how pharmaceutical commercials can work, but they never say what the actual
[08:12.380 --> 08:18.080]  pill is for. They always edit around it. Oh, they fucking hammer it up your dickhole
[08:18.080 --> 08:22.860]  in America. Well, I think the U.S. and New Zealand are like the only countries you could do it.
[08:23.740 --> 08:29.680]  Interesting, because here it'll be like, oh, you're taking this? It's good for. And then like
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.820]  a grinder will start like there will constantly be some sort of audio thing that is preventing
[08:35.820 --> 08:40.840]  you, the person listening to know what it is. And then it's just like Prevagen,
[08:41.020 --> 08:45.600]  talk to your doctor about it. So they can do they can like just cut certain things out to make
[08:45.600 --> 08:51.140]  it legal. I don't know if it's a liability thing or if it's just like one specific drug is doing
[08:51.140 --> 08:57.480]  this as a thing. But yeah, I see commercials frequently of like a drug thing that isn't.
[08:57.560 --> 09:02.100]  Well, maybe that's one of the symptoms. Maybe maybe some people think about angle grinders
[09:02.100 --> 09:08.180]  every time someone says something. It could be. Gavin has actually brought me a lot of joy
[09:08.180 --> 09:15.280]  recently in gaming. To some extent, he doesn't know. It's been a whole process recently. Has
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.640]  anyone played Marvel Rivals here? One. I played one match. Yes, I played it a bunch.
[09:21.140 --> 09:29.420]  I, I know it's been extremely popular, so I wanted to check it out. And when you go to play
[09:29.420 --> 09:37.020]  Marvel Rivals, you immediately get hit with a screen that says, hey, you need a nickname for
[09:37.020 --> 09:46.860]  yourself. And I'm pissed about it. I'm not happy. I went to put in my nickname. Obviously, I went
[09:46.860 --> 09:52.980]  Johnny Caviar. Somebody's taken it. Somebody's Johnny Caviar. I don't have Johnny Caviar.
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.340]  That's messed up. That's messed up. I was I was like, oh, I have to put in a nickname. That's
[09:59.340 --> 10:07.560]  fine. I got a dumb nickname I can use. Johnny Caviar taken real pissed. So then I thought,
[10:07.620 --> 10:13.000]  well, it will be my next nickname will be a fun nickname. So I just put in my actual name
[10:13.560 --> 10:19.560]  and that was taken. Someone beat me to my name. Well, that's well, I mean,
[10:19.560 --> 10:24.920]  that's somebody's nickname is your someone's nickname. Yeah, I can't be mad about that.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.760]  Here, let me put put in some photos to illustrate my point in Japan and taken.
[10:32.040 --> 10:39.200]  Johnny Caviar is taken. I was real mad and I was like, fuck, OK, well, then I need a name.
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.100]  And so I just I put in Gavin Free and for some reason that wasn't taken.
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.000]  Oh, my God. So I'm Gavin Free and Marvel Rivals.
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.100]  Somebody played with you and they're like, oh, my God, I played with Gavin.
[10:54.420 --> 11:00.440]  That's what you think. Yeah, that person is me. I keep playing games and Marvel Rivals and
[11:00.440 --> 11:06.020]  looking at you. Oh, no, that's me. That's weird. It's me. It's just me. It's not Gavin.
[11:06.400 --> 11:10.580]  So I've just been playing as Gavin in Marvel. Didn't consider Raymond Sommaire?
[11:11.040 --> 11:15.260]  I would never want to. I've already done that once. I don't want to go there again.
[11:15.680 --> 11:19.220]  Have people contacted you being like, hey, man, big fan of slow-mo guys?
[11:19.660 --> 11:23.020]  No, I haven't got any of those messages, unfortunately, but I thought I should
[11:23.020 --> 11:26.660]  disclose that I am Gavin Free. Your reach appears to be waning, Gavin.
[11:27.140 --> 11:30.380]  Oh, it happens. Yeah. The best part about this is Gavin can't
[11:30.380 --> 11:34.380]  retaliate by taking my name because I tried. Someone else has already done that.
[11:34.380 --> 11:36.660]  Can you make an account online or does it have to be in the game?
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.420]  Has to be in the game, I believe. All right, let me fire up this game.
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.300]  How about Ansac? That's a good one. Oh, Ansac's available, probably. Has to be.
[11:48.460 --> 11:51.380]  I got one ready to go. You have one locked and loaded?
[11:51.700 --> 11:55.320]  You got one already figured out, Gavin? I got one that I'm certainly going to try.
[11:55.840 --> 12:00.300]  Oh, that's exciting. You go with little Jeffy, Jeff?
[12:01.180 --> 12:04.740]  Uh, I think I played on Millie's account, so I had whatever she was.
[12:05.340 --> 12:08.500]  You've been on a real little Jeffy kick, and I like it whenever I see little Jeffy.
[12:08.680 --> 12:09.920]  Makes me laugh. Little Jeffy!
[12:10.020 --> 12:15.480]  I like it, too. Antonio, uh, you know, Truck Bro gave me that name, and I, uh,
[12:15.720 --> 12:19.600]  I quite liked it, so I figure the older I get, the littler I'll be.
[12:26.780 --> 12:31.600]  Oh, you have a clip? Oh, no. What's your clip?
[12:33.140 --> 12:34.960]  We don't hear anything. Yeah, are you playing?
[12:35.500 --> 12:37.820]  Are you waiting on us? Is it coming out of some headphones?
[12:38.140 --> 12:43.900]  Oh, my god. Hey, speaking of headphones, while he's figuring that out, let me tell you guys a
[12:43.900 --> 12:48.880]  funny story. A little earlier today when we were in this podcast, we were talking. This isn't the
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.700]  I said, remind me to tell you at the end. This is something that happened after that.
[12:52.280 --> 12:55.880]  I got new headphones for Christmas, and I tried to plug them in and use them today because my old
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.160]  ones are broken, and they needed to be charged, so I, like, at the last second realized that I,
[13:01.220 --> 13:04.440]  like, plugged my old ones in, and while I was sitting here listening to you guys talk
[13:04.440 --> 13:10.140]  and communicating and podcasting, the, uh, like, the tension on the left side is loose, so the
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.940]  earphone, like, falls down my head, and I was like, oh, I'm glad this is the last time I'm ever
[13:14.940 --> 13:19.260]  using these fucking headphones, and I went up to push it up, and then everybody disappeared,
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.200]  and I couldn't hear you anymore, and then I realized I have a mute button on these headphones
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.160]  that the six years I've been using them, I've never touched, and I hit it in that moment on
[13:29.160 --> 13:32.240]  literally the last day I'll ever use these headphones, and it took me about 30 seconds
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.640]  to figure it out where it was and get you guys back, and you never skipped a beat. Eric was,
[13:36.740 --> 13:40.700]  Eric was still talking when I, uh, when I came back in and, uh, completely got it.
[13:40.840 --> 13:40.960]  Phenomenal.
[13:41.420 --> 13:41.900]  Thanks, man.
[13:43.480 --> 13:45.940]  So, Gavin, how's that 1% lifestyle treating you?
[13:45.940 --> 13:46.100]  Gavin, you have that clip, or what?
[13:46.340 --> 13:46.600]  Yeah.
[13:46.980 --> 13:49.360]  Oh, I seem to have recorded a clip that has no sound.
[13:49.680 --> 13:50.940]  Oh, my God!
[13:51.240 --> 13:53.540]  Dude, you gotta open more than, like, your windows.
[13:54.640 --> 13:57.860]  Let me see if I have any other headphone stories to vamp with.
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.200]  Oh, I'm just gonna restart my phone, because I swear it had sound, because I trimmed it.
[14:02.420 --> 14:03.520]  I trimmed it to the sound.
[14:04.540 --> 14:05.960]  You trimmed it to the sound?
[14:06.220 --> 14:08.100]  Unless I trimmed out the sound.
[14:08.680 --> 14:09.680]  Can we know what it's from?
[14:10.160 --> 14:12.040]  Would you say that that trimming was editing?
[14:12.640 --> 14:13.480]  Yeah, big time.
[14:14.220 --> 14:15.300]  Dude, this dog.
[14:15.300 --> 14:17.480]  Feel like I've missed the whole editing thing.
[14:17.720 --> 14:20.140]  I keep seeing referenced. I guess I'll have to watch the VOD.
[14:20.820 --> 14:23.680]  I don't think it was even in it. I think it was before we started, mainly, wasn't it?
[14:23.860 --> 14:25.300]  A lot of it was before we started.
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.560]  We had a fight before it started, and then we had the editing fight, I think,
[14:29.600 --> 14:31.560]  near, like, the last, like, quarter of it.
[14:31.740 --> 14:36.140]  The fight before was about, uh, syncing, because we started, and then someone interrupted,
[14:36.500 --> 14:40.540]  so we missed the last, the 2-1, and so we re-synced, and Gavin says,
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.480]  we already have all the, the, the numbers, you don't need more numbers, or whatever.
[14:44.500 --> 14:45.700]  Because I'd already synced to the audio.
[14:46.300 --> 14:47.460]  You had, we hadn't.
[14:47.660 --> 14:50.180]  No, right, but why would I do it, why would I be on it twice?
[14:50.900 --> 14:52.720]  Because you weren't synced with us properly.
[14:53.700 --> 14:54.080]  I was-
[14:54.080 --> 14:56.820]  You were for three numbers, but not, not the 2-1.
[14:56.900 --> 14:59.080]  2-1 is where you come in, so you had three, and that's it.
[15:00.380 --> 15:01.380]  We're having this fight again.
[15:02.780 --> 15:04.900]  It's, it's like, it's like it's Friday again.
[15:04.900 --> 15:07.600]  I think I'm on Gavin's side in this, actually.
[15:08.100 --> 15:12.580]  How? How are you on Gavin's side in this? If, if Nick is the one who's editing,
[15:13.020 --> 15:16.580]  if Nick is the one who's editing, and he needs us to sync,
[15:16.700 --> 15:18.680]  I don't know how you could not be on Nick's side.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.560]  Because I synced to Nick's three.
[15:20.560 --> 15:22.140]  We just did it for this show!
[15:22.620 --> 15:26.320]  It's like, I, I, I, let me, let me clarify.
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.500]  If Nick is the editor, whatever Nick says goes, hands down.
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.460]  Whatever works for Nick's workflow is what we do,
[15:34.460 --> 15:38.680]  because Nick is the one editing it, and he's the, he's the boss hog of that operation.
[15:39.280 --> 15:42.440]  That's fair. Hey, Nick, can you go ahead and write, uh, defend yourself as one of your notes?
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.220]  But, uh, what Gavin is saying is, I think, correct.
[15:48.300 --> 15:49.840]  You could still sync it up just fine.
[15:50.500 --> 15:52.240]  You just wouldn't sync them all together at the same time.
[15:53.220 --> 15:57.900]  Then Nick was having framerate problems, and I was doing a backup recording of my screen.
[15:58.340 --> 16:01.600]  And I said, oh, I might have to use my footage.
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.820]  And then Nick was like, no!
[16:04.780 --> 16:06.100]  Oh, but then I've got to do editing!
[16:06.680 --> 16:09.760]  Even though he already would have had to sync to his own footage.
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.640]  But I thought Eric said that, didn't he? Didn't he say that?
[16:13.040 --> 16:13.500]  Did I say that?
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.920]  You, wait, did, oh, did you, did you not say that?
[16:18.300 --> 16:19.020]  I think it was Eric.
[16:19.200 --> 16:20.380]  Yeah, get him, Gavin, get him.
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.460]  Oh, shit.
[16:22.900 --> 16:23.980]  So you have a clip.
[16:24.540 --> 16:26.560]  I got a clip. Anyway, here's, here's my clip.
[16:27.120 --> 16:30.460]  I had the urge to film a live action bit where,
[16:30.860 --> 16:34.920]  instead of doing the water bottle hanging from the fan, ceiling fan challenge,
[16:34.980 --> 16:37.620]  I thought maybe we could tie two dogs to a ceiling fan.
[16:37.980 --> 16:41.480]  And then two people have to blindfold eat a dog.
[16:42.180 --> 16:42.840]  It's a great idea.
[16:45.600 --> 16:47.360]  It's like, you know, that trend?
[16:48.360 --> 16:49.140]  Thank you.
[16:49.220 --> 16:50.960]  People put blindfolds on and try to dodge the water bottles.
[16:51.600 --> 16:53.140]  It's like the reverse of that.
[16:54.080 --> 16:56.040]  Now that is quick.
[16:58.480 --> 16:59.280]  God damn.
[16:59.380 --> 17:00.920]  I really wanted to hear it.
[17:00.920 --> 17:01.940]  I appreciate it.
[17:02.040 --> 17:03.780]  It's even worse than I remembered it.
[17:03.960 --> 17:05.840]  And I haven't cut anything out.
[17:05.920 --> 17:07.120]  I just trimmed the beginning of the end.
[17:07.580 --> 17:09.160]  There's nothing trimmed in the middle there.
[17:11.680 --> 17:12.660]  That is wonderful.
[17:12.860 --> 17:13.240]  Thank you.
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.680]  I think I said I wanted to hear it.
[17:14.740 --> 17:15.760]  If you can bring it as a clip.
[17:16.380 --> 17:17.040]  You did say that.
[17:17.140 --> 17:17.920]  That was phenomenal.
[17:19.820 --> 17:22.520]  I was in the hills of GTA trying to find something.
[17:22.740 --> 17:23.400]  I was looking.
[17:28.020 --> 17:29.880]  It's been a real GTA kick recently.
[17:30.040 --> 17:30.980]  And I'm having a blast.
[17:31.680 --> 17:32.020]  Yeah.
[17:32.520 --> 17:33.320]  Oh, my God.
[17:33.800 --> 17:34.000]  Yeah.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.520]  How many videos did you guys record while I was gone?
[17:36.380 --> 17:37.120]  Uh, four?
[17:37.820 --> 17:37.860]  Four?
[17:37.860 --> 17:38.060]  Four?
[17:38.060 --> 17:39.180]  I think four or five.
[17:39.660 --> 17:39.840]  Yeah.
[17:40.260 --> 17:40.500]  Yeah.
[17:40.500 --> 17:41.040]  Four or five.
[17:41.160 --> 17:41.320]  One of them.
[17:41.320 --> 17:41.860]  I think it was four.
[17:42.300 --> 17:42.700]  Nice.
[17:43.020 --> 17:43.220]  Yeah.
[17:43.300 --> 17:44.720]  So a month's worth of GTA.
[17:44.720 --> 17:45.040]  Yeah.
[17:45.480 --> 17:46.240]  It'll come out.
[17:46.340 --> 17:48.720]  I mean, come August, it'll be fucking great, man.
[17:48.840 --> 17:49.460]  It's really gonna...
[17:50.200 --> 17:50.600]  How...
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.860]  If you guys had to guess, how many episodes in the can ahead are you in?
[17:55.020 --> 17:56.460]  Or are we, I should say.
[17:56.620 --> 17:57.860]  Because there's more than just the heist.
[17:58.020 --> 18:00.720]  How many episodes ahead are we in GTA right now?
[18:01.800 --> 18:02.320]  Fifteen?
[18:03.060 --> 18:05.920]  So like a Gears of War amount?
[18:06.580 --> 18:06.780]  Yeah.
[18:06.880 --> 18:08.440]  Probably a whole Gears playthrough amount.
[18:08.860 --> 18:09.260]  Wow.
[18:10.340 --> 18:10.860]  How...
[18:10.860 --> 18:11.780]  We got to get that out.
[18:12.240 --> 18:12.940]  We're working on it.
[18:13.540 --> 18:14.620]  Hey, it's Paris.
[18:15.180 --> 18:17.280]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[18:17.500 --> 18:18.300]  Like stars.
[18:18.740 --> 18:19.020]  Duh.
[18:19.520 --> 18:23.180]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[18:23.680 --> 18:28.080]  Picture me, serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream.
[18:28.540 --> 18:32.800]  Making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[18:33.520 --> 18:35.820]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[18:36.340 --> 18:37.040]  That's hot.
[18:37.700 --> 18:40.760]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[18:41.100 --> 18:42.460]  Hilton for the stay.

[19:11.200 --> 19:12.140]  Terms and conditions apply.
[19:12.940 --> 19:17.660]  We probably have enough to just put one GTA out every Monday for the whole year.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.820]  So is that something we should consider?
[19:20.820 --> 19:24.840]  Like, we're gonna put more out in a week?
[19:24.980 --> 19:28.060]  So I wanted to talk about this with y'all in Sausage Talk,
[19:28.140 --> 19:29.880]  because we've been planning on doing a Sausage Talk,
[19:29.980 --> 19:32.660]  and I think this would be a really good time to do it.
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.720]  I'm not saying we should table it here,
[19:34.840 --> 19:39.400]  but I do think there's a strong case for releasing the Monday GTA.
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.740]  Let's talk about it right now, because I don't want to wait.
[19:41.840 --> 19:44.920]  I want to know, kind of like, because we essentially need to, like,
[19:45.560 --> 19:47.340]  just look at resources and what we need to do.
[19:47.420 --> 19:49.020]  But I also kind of want to know what the...
[19:49.020 --> 19:50.720]  I know the audience, I think, by and large,
[19:50.800 --> 19:52.220]  people who are gonna, like, leave comments are gonna be like,
[19:52.260 --> 19:52.760]  yeah, more!
[19:53.200 --> 19:57.200]  But I really want to know if that's what people want, is more.
[19:57.300 --> 20:00.100]  Because, boy, that's a lot of stuff we're putting out in a week.
[20:00.440 --> 20:02.420]  It's a lot of stuff we're putting out in a week.
[20:02.760 --> 20:04.440]  I think it's nice to have a regular series,
[20:04.680 --> 20:07.760]  especially in a game where we're not, like,
[20:07.840 --> 20:09.280]  ah, twiddling our thumbs for like,
[20:09.360 --> 20:10.220]  oh, what should we do?
[20:10.340 --> 20:11.320]  What should we do with GTA?
[20:11.660 --> 20:14.780]  We've done so much stuff that we just wanted to do already.
[20:15.080 --> 20:15.860]  It's so easy.
[20:16.420 --> 20:16.780]  Yeah.
[20:17.240 --> 20:17.440]  Yeah.
[20:17.820 --> 20:19.000]  I'm not opposed...
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.020]  Again, I'm not opposed to it.
[20:21.180 --> 20:21.980]  I think that...
[20:21.980 --> 20:24.600]  I love playing GTA and I love playing it with you guys.
[20:24.760 --> 20:27.020]  And I know there are a million other ideas that we haven't done
[20:27.020 --> 20:28.380]  or haven't gone back to or whatever.
[20:29.300 --> 20:31.860]  It's... my concern is just burnout.
[20:32.080 --> 20:34.040]  We're putting out something almost every day,
[20:34.180 --> 20:35.280]  which is like...
[20:35.280 --> 20:37.620]  That, boy, that sounds like a really stupid complaint.
[20:37.780 --> 20:40.600]  But also it's a thing where that's a lot of fatigue.
[20:40.720 --> 20:42.780]  That's a lot to ask of an audience to like,
[20:42.980 --> 20:44.480]  hey, what?
[20:44.620 --> 20:47.160]  This is gonna be an hour-long video on Monday.
[20:47.160 --> 20:48.380]  Lock in.
[20:48.960 --> 20:51.040]  Boy, it's gonna be like a lot every Monday.
[20:51.400 --> 20:51.640]  No?
[20:51.800 --> 20:54.280]  I completely agree that it is a lot,
[20:54.400 --> 20:55.580]  but I don't think it's too much.
[20:55.680 --> 20:57.900]  I think it probably puts us at our limit.
[20:58.180 --> 21:02.040]  And I think that the benefits we get from having...
[21:02.040 --> 21:03.220]  I went back and I've been...
[21:03.220 --> 21:05.660]  I just, you know, I look over comments constantly
[21:06.560 --> 21:09.900]  across the history of the 23 years that I've been doing this.
[21:10.220 --> 21:15.300]  And I've seen a consistent drumbeat that people really loved
[21:15.300 --> 21:19.640]  and identified strongly with having a weekly GTA series
[21:19.640 --> 21:22.360]  that they knew was going to be there, an anchor that they could come back to.
[21:22.540 --> 21:25.960]  I understand the reason that they got rid of it at Achievement Hunter at the time.
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.700]  I, you know, who knows if it was a good decision or a bad decision.
[21:30.760 --> 21:31.860]  I understand why they did it.
[21:32.140 --> 21:36.720]  But when I see people lament and talk about the things they missed from the past,
[21:36.760 --> 21:37.840]  and I'm not trying to recreate the past.
[21:38.040 --> 21:39.700]  I'm just trying to notice the through lines.
[21:40.380 --> 21:43.320]  The thing they miss the most is fucking having a Monday slot
[21:43.320 --> 21:46.820]  that they come to every week and they would have the surprise and delight of
[21:46.820 --> 21:48.360]  maybe I don't know what the GTA thing is going to be,
[21:48.460 --> 21:50.620]  but I know it's going to be GTA and I know I'm going to love it.
[21:51.260 --> 21:53.420]  I'm looking at it more from as a company.
[21:55.220 --> 22:00.180]  We're in danger of recording way more than we'll ever be able to release.
[22:00.380 --> 22:03.480]  And then we just have a bunch of content that sits on the shelves indefinitely
[22:03.480 --> 22:06.020]  until it eventually falls off the shelf and we forget about it.
[22:06.280 --> 22:07.920]  And I just I don't want to be that inefficient.
[22:08.520 --> 22:09.020]  I agree.
[22:09.700 --> 22:12.360]  Well, at this rate, if we don't start doing this pretty regularly,
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.420]  we're going to have a GTA video that's recorded in the snow that comes out in August.
[22:16.820 --> 22:19.860]  Don't worry, some of us will still have snow when others don't.
[22:19.960 --> 22:20.700]  So it's not a big deal.
[22:20.760 --> 22:21.540]  How about this?
[22:21.580 --> 22:24.720]  There'll be snow and we'll be releasing last year's Halloween videos.
[22:25.240 --> 22:26.800]  It'll just be next year's snow.
[22:28.620 --> 22:32.240]  Looking at the calendar, if we were to put this out on Monday,
[22:32.520 --> 22:36.200]  if Monday is a GTA day, we have something coming out
[22:36.880 --> 22:39.780]  every day except Friday consistently.
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.400]  And Friday is the day that we stream.
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.940]  I think that's good.
[22:45.100 --> 22:49.380]  And maybe if people get sick of us, we just dial it back.
[22:49.700 --> 22:52.020]  Yeah, we can always dial it back if we're giving people too much.
[22:52.120 --> 22:54.560]  But I also think that we don't have to...
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.420]  Not every regulation listener or comment leaver
[22:57.420 --> 23:00.540]  has to watch or listen to every single thing we do.
[23:00.760 --> 23:04.000]  I'd like to not make so much content that they can't if they choose to,
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.820]  because that definitely happened eventually at Rooster Teeth.
[23:07.280 --> 23:10.700]  But I know there's probably a lot of people that listen to the podcast
[23:10.700 --> 23:13.600]  that don't give a shit about GTA and will never watch that video regardless.
[23:13.800 --> 23:14.020]  Of course.
[23:14.280 --> 23:15.900]  It's not for them, but for the people that love it.
[23:16.280 --> 23:17.760]  And I think it's just such a...
[23:17.760 --> 23:18.740]  I go back and I look at the numbers,
[23:18.900 --> 23:22.100]  but not just the numbers on our regulation stuff that's in GTA,
[23:22.200 --> 23:24.100]  just the enthusiasm behind it.
[23:24.440 --> 23:30.820]  And I feel like we could better serve our audience with a GTA video.
[23:31.320 --> 23:33.600]  And I think especially for you and me, Geoff,
[23:33.600 --> 23:37.420]  there's certain nostalgia that the audience already has for GTA,
[23:37.540 --> 23:39.340]  but I also feel it playing it again.
[23:39.640 --> 23:41.580]  Oh my God, dude, you and me both.
[23:41.660 --> 23:44.380]  You know what I did all day this morning when I was on the plane?
[23:44.760 --> 23:49.280]  I just watched TikToks of Easter eggs and secret locations in GTA V.
[23:49.600 --> 23:54.280]  For fucking two and a half hours on the plane, I just watched TikToks of GTA V.
[23:54.500 --> 23:56.840]  And I didn't even mean to, I just got sucked in.
[23:57.620 --> 23:59.880]  And at some point, I was just watching it as a fan
[23:59.880 --> 24:02.020]  and not as, oh, we should do that, we should do that, you know?
[24:02.020 --> 24:05.020]  It's just, there's so much, there's so much in that playground.
[24:05.620 --> 24:07.940]  I'm going to say something foreign against this.
[24:08.780 --> 24:13.100]  Against it, the main hurdle for doing this right now is just editorial workload.
[24:13.620 --> 24:15.920]  We would have to figure that out on the back end.
[24:16.080 --> 24:16.620]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:16.960 --> 24:23.700]  As far as for it, our motivations are different than they were
[24:23.700 --> 24:25.720]  when you guys were doing this for Achievement Hunter.
[24:26.280 --> 24:30.820]  Because of how we're set up, we're in a very lucky position where
[24:31.540 --> 24:34.040]  we don't really care necessarily.
[24:34.460 --> 24:37.460]  Like, obviously, views on YouTube are awesome.
[24:37.660 --> 24:40.200]  Love that people watch stuff and whatnot.
[24:40.520 --> 24:42.340]  But we're not dependent on that.
[24:42.420 --> 24:45.200]  And we're not making it because we're dependent on that.
[24:45.780 --> 24:52.300]  So if we ever got sick of GTA, we could just end GTA for whatever time
[24:52.760 --> 24:55.880]  and then just release different videos in that Monday slot.
[24:56.360 --> 24:57.380]  Totally true.
[24:57.380 --> 25:00.340]  And also, there is a danger, the way we're going,
[25:00.440 --> 25:01.940]  if we don't start putting this stuff out now,
[25:02.060 --> 25:06.960]  we're going to have six months of GTA 5 videos to put out after GTA 6 comes out.
[25:07.660 --> 25:09.560]  Yeah, we're going to start dumping the bucket out.
[25:09.720 --> 25:15.860]  I'm not worried about that specifically, but I understand the sentiment.
[25:16.700 --> 25:23.660]  But I think that, my GTA 6 joke aside, I think that Andrew does hit on a point.
[25:23.760 --> 25:27.300]  And when I'm looking at it, we're playing GTA right now,
[25:27.300 --> 25:29.200]  because we're desperate to play GTA right now.
[25:29.300 --> 25:31.960]  I get FOMO. I don't get FOMO.
[25:32.080 --> 25:33.760]  I'm not a FOMO-y kind of guy.
[25:34.100 --> 25:36.300]  But when I do get it, it's you guys playing GTA.
[25:36.980 --> 25:40.880]  And when I get to play GTA with you guys, I have the most fucking fun.
[25:41.100 --> 25:42.980]  And I think that that's the difference.
[25:43.040 --> 25:45.540]  When we were working, and not to compare everything to Achievement Hunter,
[25:45.620 --> 25:48.320]  but it's the previous job where we did mostly the exact same thing.
[25:48.840 --> 25:52.760]  There were very, very rare moments in the history of Achievement Hunter
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.860]  when we would stop recording a game and then immediately start again with that game,
[25:56.860 --> 25:59.060]  because we couldn't stop playing it, right?
[25:59.140 --> 26:01.180]  That very rarely happened, right, Gavin?
[26:01.300 --> 26:02.720]  We were always on to the next thing.
[26:02.860 --> 26:04.840]  There was very rarely a moment when we were like,
[26:04.900 --> 26:06.120]  we're having too much fun to stop.
[26:06.240 --> 26:07.140]  We got to keep rolling.
[26:07.460 --> 26:08.500]  Who cares about the schedule?
[26:08.620 --> 26:09.620]  Who cares about what else we got to do?
[26:09.700 --> 26:11.280]  We're going to heist for the next five hours.
[26:11.480 --> 26:13.180]  That just didn't happen at that place.
[26:13.200 --> 26:15.940]  And it's happening here because of how much fun we're having.
[26:16.140 --> 26:18.240]  And I think that's supposed to be the point of it, you know?
[26:18.840 --> 26:19.680]  Yeah, big time.
[26:19.800 --> 26:22.500]  I think about when I visited a few times,
[26:22.500 --> 26:26.860]  I know I've been in the office where Sarah Weems is like,
[26:27.120 --> 26:29.600]  you guys, we need three more GTAs.
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.880]  And to now live in a world where we have like 20 GTAs in the bag.
[26:34.440 --> 26:35.400]  It's so funny.
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.820]  I laugh about it all the time, just thinking about it.
[26:37.820 --> 26:39.380]  Weems would love to work for us now.
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.360]  And the nice thing about having 20 GTAs in the bag is
[26:46.200 --> 26:50.320]  if the bag ever starts to shrink and we see ourselves not filling it up,
[26:50.420 --> 26:51.760]  we know to throw the bag away.
[26:52.300 --> 26:54.640]  We don't have to do the Sarah Weems thing.
[26:54.780 --> 26:56.680]  We could just fucking recycle the bag.
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.480]  That's what I'm saying with reviews.
[26:59.240 --> 26:59.560]  Bin the bag.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.700]  Just fill the bag with different things.
[27:02.360 --> 27:04.160]  Okay, well, we'll look at...
[27:04.640 --> 27:06.300]  I want to know what the audience thinks, though.
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.520]  Like, I really do want to hear both sides of this from people.
[27:11.640 --> 27:13.000]  Like, if there's a for and against.
[27:13.200 --> 27:16.500]  Because I want to play GTA all day.
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.120]  We played GTA before we started taping this.
[27:20.220 --> 27:21.740]  Like, we played it so much today.
[27:21.760 --> 27:22.900]  I want to keep playing GTA.
[27:23.060 --> 27:23.380]  I love it.
[27:23.500 --> 27:32.000]  But I just don't want to burn people out when they feel obligated to watch this thing or whatever.
[27:32.260 --> 27:36.360]  I just want to hear from people and how they're feeling about this.
[27:36.400 --> 27:37.500]  Because it is a big addition.
[27:38.200 --> 27:40.640]  We do need to bolster editorial.
[27:41.520 --> 27:43.120]  It's something we have to schedule.
[27:43.440 --> 27:45.420]  We have to plan how these things come out.
[27:45.800 --> 27:48.400]  There's more to it than just, like, we did one.
[27:48.520 --> 27:49.320]  Here it is.
[27:49.860 --> 27:50.340]  Obviously.
[27:50.340 --> 27:55.980]  But I want to hear from the audience about what they think of what would be GTA Monday.
[27:56.460 --> 28:01.840]  Can I jump in real fast and alleviate a concern I know the audience is going to bring up immediately
[28:01.840 --> 28:03.040]  as a reason against?
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.380]  They're going to say...
[28:04.380 --> 28:07.300]  Essentially, they're going to reword what you just said, but put it back at us and say,
[28:07.400 --> 28:09.000]  we just don't want you guys to get burned out.
[28:09.060 --> 28:10.760]  We just don't want you guys to get burned out doing too much.
[28:11.340 --> 28:13.260]  There's no danger of us getting burned out in GTA.
[28:13.320 --> 28:16.600]  If we stopped today, you would have GTA videos through May, probably.
[28:16.900 --> 28:18.780]  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[28:18.780 --> 28:20.360]  And if you guys...
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.660]  I mean, I think saying publicly is very important that if you guys are good with when we don't
[28:25.660 --> 28:30.940]  have the gas for it anymore, we just turn off that Monday slot and we don't do it there,
[28:31.060 --> 28:32.020]  then I'm fine with it.
[28:32.120 --> 28:37.920]  That is my other concern, is that now we have an obligation, and I don't want to be obligated
[28:37.920 --> 28:44.020]  to six days a week plus one day of streaming of churning this stuff out if we're not feeling it.
[28:44.100 --> 28:45.340]  I'm definitely feeling it right now.
[28:45.360 --> 28:46.700]  Like, I want to keep doing it.
[28:46.700 --> 28:52.460]  As long as we're really upfront about that and going into it thinking that way, then I'm fine.
[28:52.480 --> 28:54.680]  It's not a Monday forever slot.
[28:54.820 --> 29:00.620]  It's a Monday GTA slot until we get tired of GTA, and then the slot goes away.
[29:01.540 --> 29:03.900]  We don't have to then suddenly fill it with Minecraft or
[29:03.900 --> 29:05.960]  Seven Days to Die or whatever the next game is.
[29:06.160 --> 29:07.220]  Or we could if we wanted to.
[29:07.760 --> 29:08.200]  That's true.
[29:08.680 --> 29:10.080]  What if we all have a button, right?
[29:10.900 --> 29:14.100]  And when you're sick of GTA, you press the button.
[29:14.740 --> 29:20.480]  And when all five buttons have been pressed, it alerts us that we should stop playing GTA.
[29:21.120 --> 29:24.680]  So as long as one person's having fun while the other four are miserable...
[29:24.680 --> 29:25.800]  No, that doesn't work with us.
[29:26.680 --> 29:30.260]  Because if Jeff was the only one who hadn't hit the button,
[29:30.740 --> 29:34.000]  Jeff would get more joy from knowing that we don't want to play GTA.
[29:35.200 --> 29:37.640]  He would never hit it.
[29:37.700 --> 29:43.240]  I have never felt more seen in my entire life than right now by Andrew.
[29:43.240 --> 29:44.280]  Thank you, Andrew.
[29:44.380 --> 29:45.760]  I'll take that as a huge compliment.
[29:46.160 --> 29:50.520]  You're either pressing it first or you're never fucking touching that button.
[29:50.980 --> 29:55.200]  Jeff could even know that all four other buttons are pressed and he still wouldn't press it.
[29:56.260 --> 29:57.400]  You never press it.
[29:58.040 --> 29:59.200]  He's just never hitting that button.
[30:00.280 --> 30:01.860]  I tried to quit Rooster Teeth for like seven years.
[30:01.920 --> 30:02.640]  I couldn't press the button.
[30:05.780 --> 30:06.980]  I think that's fine.
[30:07.060 --> 30:10.000]  I think as long as we're up front about that,
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.960]  and if we just go like, okay, we're done with this, then we're done with it.
[30:13.240 --> 30:14.060]  Then that's fine.
[30:14.200 --> 30:20.060]  I just don't, I don't want people to feel married to a thing because we've put this thing on like a day.
[30:20.120 --> 30:22.440]  That being said, I want to keep playing GTA.
[30:22.660 --> 30:24.000]  I don't want to stop playing GTA.
[30:24.320 --> 30:27.840]  We should, we should play more GTA right now instead of doing this.
[30:28.020 --> 30:29.440]  Like that's how I feel.
[30:29.920 --> 30:30.360]  Yeah.
[30:30.960 --> 30:33.240]  Or we mail a button to everyone in the audience.
[30:33.420 --> 30:35.700]  And when every single person has pressed that button.
[30:36.700 --> 30:39.820]  That's a lot of, that's a lot of buttons, man.
[30:40.600 --> 30:41.920]  They can just leave a comment.
[30:42.340 --> 30:44.100]  Yeah, they can press it digitally.
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.500]  Oh yeah, it's built in.
[30:49.720 --> 30:53.160]  Eric, I'm pretty offended by your voice memo that you sent me in the middle of this, by the way.
[30:53.320 --> 30:55.320]  Well, I mean, I think it's probably a 7.5 now.
[30:55.840 --> 30:57.320]  Okay. This was the voice memo he sent.
[30:57.700 --> 31:00.920]  Hey man, I think this is a six and a half out of 10 so far.
[31:01.580 --> 31:04.820]  Yeah. And that was about 16 minutes into the episode.
[31:05.140 --> 31:05.280]  Yeah.
[31:05.300 --> 31:07.020]  Let's, uh, let's move on from GTA.
[31:07.260 --> 31:08.720]  I don't want a six and a half this episode.
[31:08.720 --> 31:12.380]  The GTA conversation brought it up to a 7.5.
[31:12.500 --> 31:15.300]  The six and a half is when Gavin didn't have his clip ready.
[31:15.900 --> 31:17.660]  Like we had to talk about like medicine.
[31:18.420 --> 31:18.940]  You know what I mean?
[31:19.040 --> 31:21.640]  Like it was just sort of like, oh, okay.
[31:21.860 --> 31:23.680]  Gavin's like really dragging this thing down.
[31:24.100 --> 31:26.740]  So in my defense, when my phone came back on, it just played.
[31:26.880 --> 31:27.840]  So I don't know what was wrong with it.
[31:28.420 --> 31:29.940]  Is that in your defense?
[31:30.240 --> 31:33.060]  Make another note, you successfully defended myself.
[31:33.620 --> 31:36.020]  Andrew, I'm ready to defend myself for the original defense.
[31:36.460 --> 31:38.220]  I was never going to bring that up.
[31:38.220 --> 31:39.280]  I said that.
[31:39.280 --> 31:40.420]  Why'd you write it down as a note?
[31:40.780 --> 31:41.140]  Okay.
[31:41.340 --> 31:42.180]  So this is what I did.
[31:42.240 --> 31:48.280]  We're doing, we're, we filmed the video and I thought I'm just going to have some fun for myself right now.
[31:48.380 --> 31:55.180]  I'm going to verbally say, put down as a note for the podcast that Gavin caused a delay.
[31:55.340 --> 32:00.980]  And then he'll just be thinking about having to defend that between now and then this entire time.
[32:01.280 --> 32:02.520]  That was, that was never a real thing.
[32:02.660 --> 32:03.780]  If you want, I can bring it up.
[32:03.820 --> 32:05.000]  If you want, I can talk about it.
[32:05.180 --> 32:06.560]  But I had no intent to bring it up.
[32:06.560 --> 32:07.980]  We know each other too well.
[32:08.220 --> 32:09.840]  Well, I think now you have to talk about it.
[32:10.200 --> 32:11.340]  What a mind game.
[32:12.420 --> 32:15.540]  Well, I really, he, it went against me ultimately in the end,
[32:15.640 --> 32:18.900]  which is why I thought I don't necessarily mind not talking about this,
[32:19.140 --> 32:22.600]  but we're filming something and Gavin didn't have the game.
[32:23.280 --> 32:29.020]  He showed up late to begin with because of a bathroom issue, which I understand.
[32:29.020 --> 32:30.800]  Yeah, I texted him at five minutes too.
[32:30.880 --> 32:33.500]  And I was like, look, I've just started a poo and I can tell it's going to go long.
[32:34.080 --> 32:34.720]  So he's late.
[32:34.720 --> 32:37.500]  And then we went to film and he's like, yeah, I don't have the game.
[32:37.720 --> 32:38.340]  Where's the game?
[32:38.580 --> 32:41.240]  And then I had to walk him through how to install the game.
[32:41.660 --> 32:45.460]  And then it took about 20 minutes to get it installed.
[32:45.600 --> 32:47.820]  And then none of his setup worked.
[32:47.960 --> 32:49.980]  So then it was another 30 minutes.
[32:50.700 --> 32:51.580]  What game is this?
[32:51.880 --> 32:52.820]  Hitman 3.
[32:53.120 --> 32:54.880]  Hitman 3, which I couldn't figure out.
[32:54.940 --> 32:58.560]  I was like, wait, which, because, because they did that thing where there's like Hitman 1,
[32:58.640 --> 33:02.020]  Hitman 2, Hitman 3, Hitman World of Assassination,
[33:02.020 --> 33:06.200]  Hitman World of Assassination for X and S, Hitman 3 for X and S.
[33:06.220 --> 33:09.380]  It's like, which goddamn Hitman am I playing?
[33:09.500 --> 33:12.740]  And then I realized when I swapped my one terabyte
[33:12.740 --> 33:15.340]  little memory expansion for the two terabyte one,
[33:16.120 --> 33:18.500]  I guess I just didn't download it again.
[33:18.900 --> 33:21.640]  But I couldn't figure it out because I know I didn't delete it.
[33:21.740 --> 33:23.100]  I must have just unplugged it.
[33:23.460 --> 33:26.460]  So it took, it took like 12 minutes to install again.
[33:26.760 --> 33:29.280]  That was the most confusing part of this as we were doing,
[33:29.280 --> 33:33.540]  they just added Jean-Claude Van Damme as a target in the game.
[33:34.120 --> 33:37.020]  And we did this when Conor McGregor was added,
[33:37.580 --> 33:42.460]  where we both filmed because you only get one shot at it essentially to complete the mission.
[33:42.840 --> 33:46.160]  So after filling time, just chatting shit for like 10,
[33:46.380 --> 33:49.360]  well, it was like 15, 20 minutes in the end after my poo and all that.
[33:50.220 --> 33:53.940]  We're just waiting for my download to finish and eventually I have it.
[33:54.140 --> 33:56.260]  I get the DLC in, it's all ready to go.
[33:56.720 --> 33:59.080]  And Andrew says, do you want to go first or shall I?
[33:59.280 --> 34:01.820]  And then Gavin correctly brought up,
[34:01.940 --> 34:05.980]  why didn't I just go while we were waiting instead of killing time?
[34:06.220 --> 34:07.360]  I couldn't believe it.
[34:07.720 --> 34:10.400]  He was, that's, what the fuck?
[34:10.720 --> 34:13.520]  He was like, oh, you're making us late.
[34:13.640 --> 34:15.760]  You know, I can't believe you weren't ready on that stuff.
[34:15.880 --> 34:18.780]  Because that is definitely something that I bring up all the time.
[34:18.860 --> 34:21.380]  Like if someone's not ready, I'm like, oh, wow, you only had.
[34:21.400 --> 34:25.260]  In my defense, you didn't have the game installed.
[34:26.020 --> 34:26.460]  Yeah.
[34:26.460 --> 34:31.120]  You, you, you, you were below zero on the process.
[34:31.320 --> 34:31.560]  Yeah, I agree.
[34:32.120 --> 34:34.940]  If I can jump in real fast, just for a second.
[34:35.100 --> 34:38.280]  Gavin, I've noticed that this is not the first time
[34:38.280 --> 34:43.280]  recently that we or some form of us have been held off by your poo.
[34:43.860 --> 34:48.140]  And I'm starting to wonder, do you have some sort of a Pavlovian response to recording with us?
[34:48.200 --> 34:51.640]  Whereas like, as soon as you get, you hear the alarm on your phone,
[34:51.700 --> 34:54.880]  it says you're recording 10 minutes, you immediately have to take a nasty shit.
[34:54.880 --> 34:58.960]  No, it's just like, as you know, if we're like half an hour coming up to a recording,
[34:59.040 --> 35:00.660]  I'm like, oh, let me quickly get a coffee.
[35:00.860 --> 35:03.420]  And then right before we start, I'm like, oh, the coffee poo.
[35:03.640 --> 35:05.440]  I keep forgetting about the coffee poo.
[35:06.740 --> 35:07.300]  That's fair.
[35:07.800 --> 35:11.580]  And, uh, I've also, we did, we did that live action day.
[35:11.940 --> 35:17.460]  And that coincided with being the day after the night that I got back on my CPAP.
[35:18.440 --> 35:19.860]  Oh, that was so fair.
[35:19.920 --> 35:20.320]  Fortnite.
[35:21.100 --> 35:28.920]  There's so many moments where we're in the middle of riffing and then Gavin just doubles over.
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.480]  It was so painful. I woke up in agony. Like, I couldn't bend my body.
[35:34.900 --> 35:36.780]  I had to like, without bending anything,
[35:37.120 --> 35:40.480]  shuffle to the toilet so I could just sit and fart for like 20 minutes.
[35:40.740 --> 35:42.760]  And then I had to leave to go to Jeff's house.
[35:43.080 --> 35:45.620]  So I'm there just like, trying not to guff up this Uber.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.380]  I get out, I blow some out in the street before I go in.
[35:48.380 --> 35:53.360]  And then I just couldn't get all the air out. I must've had like two balloons in me.
[35:54.280 --> 35:57.140]  So in the middle of filming, in some of those videos,
[35:57.260 --> 35:59.400]  you might see the camera just point to the ground occasionally.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.020]  And then when I come up, Eric's about to die laughing.
[36:03.400 --> 36:05.260]  You gotta start recording those farts, buddy.
[36:05.540 --> 36:10.540]  Oh, it's so funny. It's so fucking funny.
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.220]  Like, it's so not what I expect from you when we are filming.
[36:16.220 --> 36:18.260]  You're so like, dialed in.
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.200]  Yeah, it's at all. Oh my god. Dude, it's hilarious.
[36:22.580 --> 36:26.240]  Have we ever talked about the fart match idea before?
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.420]  Where everybody records a fart or two,
[36:28.480 --> 36:30.840]  and then we jumble them up and then play them and see who can,
[36:30.960 --> 36:32.560]  if you can guess your fart correctly.
[36:32.700 --> 36:34.940]  Yeah, I think that was like an early f*** face idea.
[36:34.940 --> 36:36.680]  That's an early, early idea, right?
[36:36.820 --> 36:38.420]  That's like, really early. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:38.420 --> 36:41.040]  Now that Gavin's back on farting again, maybe we should look into it.
[36:41.040 --> 36:44.120]  Yeah, did you like, talk to a doctor about that yet, or what?
[36:44.540 --> 36:47.400]  I googled it, and I just turned down the pressure a little bit,
[36:47.440 --> 36:50.260]  and it seems to be putting less into my gut hole.
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.640]  Okay, so what I asked, the answer was no.
[36:54.180 --> 36:54.820]  No, god no.
[36:54.860 --> 36:56.000]  Okay, cool. Just making sure.
[36:57.240 --> 36:59.300]  What you gave me was an Andrew answer.
[36:59.800 --> 37:04.960]  What I asked, you almost answered, and we sort of got something out of it, so.
[37:05.260 --> 37:08.000]  I don't like anything about the CPAP though, because I'm clearly like,
[37:08.120 --> 37:10.460]  now that I'm dialing it in, I'm getting better sleep,
[37:10.920 --> 37:12.400]  and I've started having dreams.
[37:12.960 --> 37:14.040]  I'm dreaming again.
[37:14.380 --> 37:16.600]  I don't have that. I think I might need this.
[37:16.660 --> 37:18.700]  I don't dream. How is that going?
[37:19.040 --> 37:22.100]  The dreams are so elaborate and long.
[37:22.620 --> 37:25.320]  I can't, like, I wake up from them completely exhausted,
[37:25.380 --> 37:28.240]  because I just spent eight hours trying to outrun a tornado.
[37:29.180 --> 37:31.040]  Well, that sounds fun.
[37:31.500 --> 37:34.060]  I think, I didn't realize it, but I just wasn't dreaming,
[37:34.180 --> 37:35.820]  or I wasn't having dreams long enough to remember.
[37:37.520 --> 37:41.240]  The only dreams that I have or remember are nightmares.
[37:41.780 --> 37:44.580]  I don't remember, I don't remember any dreams.
[37:44.780 --> 37:46.160]  I only have nightmares.
[37:47.300 --> 37:48.720]  Yeah, most of them are nightmares.
[37:49.080 --> 37:51.720]  I had a dream the other day that when I was in Detroit,
[37:51.960 --> 37:54.700]  that I was fully bald, but kind of like a monk style.
[37:54.840 --> 37:56.160]  I just woke up and it was like that.
[37:56.260 --> 37:59.220]  And so the whole dream was me trying to get a headpiece to fit on my head.
[37:59.580 --> 38:00.240]  So nobody knew.
[38:00.380 --> 38:01.300]  Oh, man.
[38:01.700 --> 38:04.680]  Have you seen Mark Wahlberg in his new movie?
[38:04.960 --> 38:07.120]  No. Oh my God.
[38:07.180 --> 38:08.540]  Yeah, kind of like that. Kind of like that.
[38:08.840 --> 38:09.660]  No, I haven't seen that.
[38:10.020 --> 38:10.320]  Oh, wow.
[38:11.040 --> 38:13.400]  It's funny you say that, Gavin, because I've been having a sleep thing too,
[38:13.480 --> 38:16.660]  where ever since I had the initial jaw problem, I feel like I'm not sleeping well.
[38:16.880 --> 38:21.100]  And so I had to get that fucking mouth guard that I've been sleeping with.
[38:21.140 --> 38:22.900]  And I just feel like I wake up a bunch of the night.
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.660]  And so I decided, Emily was like, you should get that aura ring and track it.
[38:27.680 --> 38:29.700]  And then you can figure out what's going on and everything.
[38:29.800 --> 38:32.500]  So I bought that stupid aura ring, which I wear now.
[38:32.900 --> 38:37.620]  And all it does is tell me, hey, you slept great last night.
[38:37.640 --> 38:39.460]  If you feel tired, you're wrong.
[38:39.460 --> 38:43.340]  You got an 86. You got 93% rested.
[38:43.820 --> 38:45.660]  Wow, dude, you got a B-Plux. That's awesome.
[38:45.820 --> 38:49.000]  And it's like, I've never had a bad night's sleep, according to the fucking aura.
[38:49.520 --> 38:51.100]  And it's like, hey, congratulations.
[38:52.380 --> 38:54.760]  You slept great. And I'm waking up like, oh, fuck.
[38:55.020 --> 38:57.700]  Oh, God, I feel like shit. Why? How could I sleep?
[38:58.020 --> 39:02.020]  Like, who? Does a ghost come and put the ring on every night after I fall asleep?
[39:02.280 --> 39:03.000]  It's ridiculous.
[39:04.040 --> 39:05.620]  How is your jaw stuff?
[39:05.980 --> 39:07.520]  I don't know. I don't know.
[39:08.160 --> 39:09.840]  Boy, that was a loaded answer.
[39:09.980 --> 39:13.500]  I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know.
[39:14.300 --> 39:18.820]  It's not blinding pain or anything, but I would be lying if I said my jaw felt good
[39:18.820 --> 39:20.800]  or I felt comfortable all day long.
[39:21.020 --> 39:23.760]  And I just I'm living with it because I don't know what else to do.
[39:24.080 --> 39:28.300]  I'm going to ask about Andrew's sleep, because you were slacking at like 5am this morning.
[39:28.860 --> 39:31.300]  Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, I'm not.
[39:31.420 --> 39:33.700]  I'm coughing. I'm breathing bad.
[39:34.240 --> 39:35.600]  So I'm not sleeping great.
[39:35.600 --> 39:37.620]  Or I'm sleeping in like chunks.
[39:37.800 --> 39:40.660]  You know, we don't have to film two GTAs and a podcast.
[39:41.100 --> 39:41.860]  No, but I wanted to.
[39:41.920 --> 39:42.500]  The day you wake up at 4am.
[39:43.160 --> 39:44.900]  His war ring said he got enough sleep.
[39:45.380 --> 39:47.040]  They said, yeah, he said I was killing it.
[39:47.860 --> 39:50.760]  No, I up and down.
[39:51.580 --> 39:55.720]  Go to sleep early, wake up two hours later, go to sleep, wake up two hours, up for a bit.
[39:55.800 --> 39:56.300]  That's the worst.
[39:58.060 --> 40:00.360]  Yeah, as soon as we finished GTA, I slept.
[40:00.840 --> 40:05.040]  Then I woke up and I saw that you needed to push the podcast back an hour and I went,
[40:05.040 --> 40:06.980]  great, more sleep, went back to sleep.
[40:09.380 --> 40:11.040]  So I'm getting my rest when I can.
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.020]  But yeah, it's definitely it's not it's not fun.
[40:14.580 --> 40:16.200]  Not any great dreams either.
[40:16.780 --> 40:17.780]  Do you wake up from nightmares?
[40:18.200 --> 40:19.500]  I don't wake up in them anymore.
[40:19.500 --> 40:22.220]  Like I remember as a kid, like waking up out of them.
[40:22.360 --> 40:25.560]  And now it's just like, oh, this is not a great thing that's happening.
[40:26.060 --> 40:31.640]  And then I'll wake up from from one two days ago where it was in the middle of a eight hour
[40:31.640 --> 40:33.100]  runaway from a tornado dream.
[40:33.520 --> 40:35.820]  And I'd finally sought shelter in this basement.
[40:35.920 --> 40:36.780]  And I was sat in an armchair.
[40:37.240 --> 40:40.600]  And then all of a sudden I heard like the wind was coming in.
[40:40.760 --> 40:42.760]  And then the chair started to fold me in half.
[40:42.820 --> 40:43.740]  It started to crush me.
[40:43.980 --> 40:44.380]  Oh, my God.
[40:44.580 --> 40:47.140]  And I woke up in bed in the position I got crushed in.
[40:47.200 --> 40:48.120]  I was all like fetal.
[40:48.280 --> 40:51.520]  And my CPAP had come off and was blowing air into my face.
[40:51.940 --> 40:55.780]  And it was like the dream just ended exactly how I was in real life.
[40:55.980 --> 40:57.980]  Do you think the tornado is the CPAP machine?
[40:59.240 --> 41:00.040]  Oh, maybe.
[41:00.620 --> 41:01.760]  It's the air.
[41:01.880 --> 41:03.340]  Does it make a lot of sound?
[41:04.220 --> 41:06.300]  That's when it kind of comes loose.
[41:08.980 --> 41:11.300]  So the CPAP is the tornado machine.
[41:11.500 --> 41:15.900]  Do you think maybe Dorothy was on a CPAP and that's how Wizard of Oz happened?
[41:16.460 --> 41:17.360]  I think so.
[41:17.660 --> 41:20.100]  Someone's got to make an edit where she wakes up at the end of the movie.
[41:23.380 --> 41:26.900]  She got the CPAP on and wore a ring or whatever.
[41:27.860 --> 41:28.620]  Ninety two.
[41:28.820 --> 41:29.120]  Good work.
[41:29.120 --> 41:33.120]  And then she bends over and farts for like five minutes straight.
[41:34.580 --> 41:40.540]  Andrew, you don't get to see it, but when Gavin bends over and farts out of nowhere,
[41:41.840 --> 41:46.820]  it's like when a dog needs to like scratch his ass on the carpet.
[41:47.040 --> 41:48.160]  It's just very sudden.
[41:48.500 --> 41:49.440]  It's so funny.
[41:49.760 --> 41:52.340]  He makes a very like desperate mingy face too.
[41:52.920 --> 41:53.920]  It's not good.
[41:53.920 --> 41:54.920]  So painful.
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.720]  Hey, while I was out of town for the holidays, you know, I was out of town for the last week
[42:00.720 --> 42:02.160]  or so in up in Detroit.
[42:03.460 --> 42:06.140]  And by the way, fucking shout out to Detroit.
[42:06.280 --> 42:07.040]  What an awesome place.
[42:08.560 --> 42:11.200]  But I did something for us while I was up there.
[42:11.260 --> 42:13.380]  Oh, I was saying this more.
[42:13.460 --> 42:15.980]  I was saying when I came in today, I was like, I hope you guys got a lot of stories and stuff.
[42:16.020 --> 42:17.100]  So I really don't have anything on my notes.
[42:17.120 --> 42:19.320]  And Eric was saying, oh, I thought you'd have a ton from your vacation.
[42:20.220 --> 42:22.620]  Nothing eventful happened other than I went to an awesome hockey game.
[42:22.620 --> 42:25.640]  And I have some opinions about hockey that I can share at any point in the future.
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.240]  But what I did do was I spent a couple...
[42:29.240 --> 42:34.200]  I took a couple of days and I went to a coffee shop and I sat down with all of my notes from
[42:34.200 --> 42:34.660]  the year.
[42:35.420 --> 42:42.480]  And a few weeks ago, Eric very kindly made a Google Doc for us that was like an ideas list.
[42:43.240 --> 42:48.240]  And I went and I wrote down and filled out every idea I've had in the last year that
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.260]  we haven't done that I think is worth doing and just populated that list for us.
[42:52.260 --> 42:55.620]  So I put up, I think, 22 ideas.
[42:55.800 --> 42:57.340]  Most of it stuff you guys know, some of it's not.
[42:57.600 --> 43:04.300]  But anyway, that was like the whole focus of my time in Detroit was just consolidating
[43:04.300 --> 43:06.240]  ideas and trying to get ready for us in 2025.
[43:06.640 --> 43:09.980]  So I encourage you all to do the same and put any ideas that are missed or that you
[43:09.980 --> 43:13.880]  have on the sheet as well so that we can start prioritizing and dive in.
[43:13.940 --> 43:15.420]  I'm really excited to film a lot of this stuff.
[43:15.680 --> 43:17.520]  Yeah, I saw Emily's story about how you were scheming.
[43:18.020 --> 43:18.720]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[43:18.900 --> 43:22.240]  Did you lose any of the ideas to your handwriting or was it always typed the whole time?
[43:22.260 --> 43:23.640]  Typed the whole time, baby.
[43:23.800 --> 43:24.460]  Oh, perfect.
[43:24.960 --> 43:28.320]  Yeah, I don't understand some of my notes sometimes, but I was able to extrapolate.
[43:29.480 --> 43:32.140]  It's fun, though, sometimes when you don't understand your notes,
[43:32.280 --> 43:36.280]  you just look at it and go like, what the fuck am I trying to convey here?
[43:36.500 --> 43:37.900]  Yeah, bog roll folders.
[43:38.060 --> 43:39.720]  And then sometimes you'll piece it together later.
[43:40.320 --> 43:40.800]  It's great.
[43:41.640 --> 43:43.880]  We still don't know what bog roll folders is, as you said, yeah.
[43:44.200 --> 43:47.840]  Yeah, it's got to be about like who does the what and who does the fold.
[43:47.900 --> 43:49.260]  But I don't know why it was a note.
[43:49.260 --> 43:53.080]  Oh, maybe, maybe you flipped.
[43:53.460 --> 43:54.980]  Yeah. Oh, that's that's good.
[43:55.100 --> 44:01.980]  I had always taken it as keeping a folder in your bathroom where you keep extra toilet paper.
[44:02.200 --> 44:05.740]  Like I have like an inventory list on a clipboard.
[44:06.740 --> 44:11.000]  Like you have like you run out of like regular rolls of toilet paper.
[44:11.240 --> 44:14.620]  But don't worry, I have this folder that's been keeping extra.
[44:15.720 --> 44:16.960]  That's I don't know why.
[44:17.060 --> 44:19.460]  That's that's the way that I understood.
[44:21.440 --> 44:24.000]  Should we make bog roll folders?
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.020]  It's no, that's not good.
[44:26.180 --> 44:26.760]  It's practical.
[44:27.360 --> 44:30.040]  And they come with their emergency bog roll.
[44:30.160 --> 44:31.500]  You have like, oh, that's interesting.
[44:34.340 --> 44:38.400]  Like you wouldn't have to open the door when people go like, oh, my God, I'm out of toilet
[44:38.400 --> 44:41.360]  paper. Can you pass me toilet paper?
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.260]  Yeah, you just let me get you the folder and you slide it right under the door
[44:45.260 --> 44:49.000]  instead of having to open it and smell the stink that they are creating.
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.120]  So does it look like a folder full of papers and stuff?
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.560]  But it's just very, very well folded in the folder.
[44:58.440 --> 45:00.860]  Yeah, I know exactly what it should look like.
[45:00.920 --> 45:02.140]  Like stealth bog roll.
[45:02.220 --> 45:03.680]  Like it doesn't look like that's what it is.
[45:03.720 --> 45:10.420]  It should look like this classic American folder that kids had in school.
[45:10.420 --> 45:11.360]  We post it here.
[45:11.700 --> 45:15.300]  Except it's three different dudes action shitting in different poses.
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.620]  That's dude, that's pretty good.
[45:17.960 --> 45:19.120]  That's an inside.
[45:19.240 --> 45:21.060]  Would it just be like sheets of toilet paper?
[45:21.260 --> 45:23.520]  Yeah, just be like sheets of sheets of toilet paper.
[45:23.820 --> 45:25.620]  That's perfect because you could keep those.
[45:26.120 --> 45:29.720]  You would keep that in like a drawer or a filing cabinet so that when you truly run
[45:29.720 --> 45:31.640]  out of toilet paper, you've gone to every bathroom.
[45:31.720 --> 45:33.420]  You're like, shit, I can't believe it.
[45:33.440 --> 45:34.360]  We've got to go to the store.
[45:34.500 --> 45:38.060]  Then you go to the bog roll folder that you know is in the filing cabinet.
[45:38.860 --> 45:39.300]  Absolutely.
[45:39.300 --> 45:44.400]  The thing that worries me about Jeff's is that it makes me feel like I have schoolwork due.
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.640]  And the good thing about a bog roll folder is that you can customize it as you see fit.
[45:49.700 --> 45:50.600]  I think this would be mine.
[45:50.920 --> 45:53.580]  I would go more of a Lisa Frank sort of vibe.
[45:54.900 --> 45:55.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:55.720 --> 45:58.680]  I think doing like, oh, that's full of toilet paper.
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.080]  I think there's a documentary on Lisa Frank.
[46:01.180 --> 46:01.760]  I saw the other day.
[46:01.840 --> 46:02.140]  I want to watch.
[46:02.140 --> 46:02.320]  Really?
[46:02.740 --> 46:08.720]  Yeah, there's something about Lisa Frank was worth documenting, I guess.
[46:09.580 --> 46:12.560]  I don't know if it's a scam or hubris or who knows.
[46:12.900 --> 46:16.820]  Maybe I should get in the lab and see if I can condense an entire toilet paper roll
[46:17.380 --> 46:19.460]  to fit in one of those unsuspectingly.
[46:20.320 --> 46:21.840]  Or how much you can.
[46:23.080 --> 46:26.620]  Imagine you're out of toilet paper and somebody goes, don't worry, man, I got you.
[46:26.640 --> 46:28.660]  And they slide this underneath.
[46:28.940 --> 46:31.740]  It's a shark on rollerblades and it says radical.
[46:32.220 --> 46:33.260]  And he has a mohawk.
[46:33.620 --> 46:34.720]  Yeah, dude.
[46:34.860 --> 46:36.180]  And Oakley razor blades.
[46:36.560 --> 46:37.460]  Yeah, wouldn't that be awesome?
[46:37.460 --> 46:41.560]  I think it's perfect because it's not only a stealth and it's like an emergency ration.
[46:41.720 --> 46:43.840]  It will slide perfectly under a door.
[46:44.460 --> 46:47.400]  What if what if it's pretty much that image?
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.600]  We change it enough so that we're not ripping off whatever that artist is.
[46:50.660 --> 46:52.280]  But then behind him is the toilet.
[46:53.200 --> 46:55.080]  So there's just hints to it.
[46:56.560 --> 46:58.660]  Like he's blasting off from the toilet.
[46:58.760 --> 47:00.200]  Oh, he's definitely blasting off.
[47:00.280 --> 47:00.580]  Hell yeah.
[47:01.640 --> 47:02.360]  I love it.
[47:02.420 --> 47:03.500]  I like this.
[47:03.660 --> 47:05.540]  See, we figured out what bog roll folders.
[47:05.540 --> 47:06.540]  We did it.
[47:06.840 --> 47:07.440]  Certainly did not.
[47:11.640 --> 47:14.300]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[47:14.640 --> 47:17.940]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[47:18.380 --> 47:20.200]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[47:20.420 --> 47:23.640]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[47:23.780 --> 47:28.080]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or using the award-winning app,
[47:28.300 --> 47:31.800]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[47:32.060 --> 47:34.060]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[47:36.700 --> 47:40.520]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[47:40.840 --> 47:43.720]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[47:43.860 --> 47:47.420]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[47:47.780 --> 47:49.280]  Available for a limited time.
[47:49.540 --> 47:51.680]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.320]  I put a theory down in the Slack the other day
[47:54.320 --> 47:57.060]  that I want to put out to the audience and see if there's agreement for.
[47:57.620 --> 47:57.900]  Okay.
[47:58.340 --> 48:04.680]  I believe that Mouse Hunt is genuinely the third best Home Alone movie.
[48:05.280 --> 48:06.120]  Pretty good theory.
[48:07.220 --> 48:07.940]  Well, extrapolate.
[48:08.260 --> 48:08.420]  Yeah.
[48:08.700 --> 48:10.720]  Well, the mouse is Kevin McAllister.
[48:11.100 --> 48:13.960]  Lee Evans and Nathan Lane are the sticky bandits.
[48:14.680 --> 48:16.600]  Getting up to all kinds of trouble, traps and shit.
[48:17.240 --> 48:18.820]  It's better than Home Alone 3, 4, and 5.
[48:19.380 --> 48:19.620]  Yeah.
[48:19.840 --> 48:21.740]  I have to watch it again. I haven't seen it since...
[48:22.740 --> 48:23.380]  God knows when.
[48:23.980 --> 48:27.700]  If we watch... if any of us have to watch Mouse Hunt,
[48:27.800 --> 48:29.360]  we should probably make it a Falcon event, right?
[48:29.680 --> 48:32.300]  Yeah, if one has to watch it, we should all have to watch it.
[48:33.340 --> 48:36.160]  No, and again, to be clear, nobody has to watch it.
[48:37.540 --> 48:39.180]  No reason we have to do that.
[48:39.380 --> 48:41.760]  It's gotta be a step up from Snow Day.
[48:43.060 --> 48:44.200]  I didn't hate Snow Day.
[48:44.480 --> 48:46.380]  The whole next day, I was telling people about
[48:46.380 --> 48:50.380]  how much fun I had watching Snow Day because it was 91 minutes.
[48:50.820 --> 48:53.060]  I didn't hate it either, but that's what I'm saying.
[48:53.160 --> 48:54.500]  It's got to be better than that, even.
[48:54.780 --> 48:57.640]  And so it's got to be like an A+, because Snow Day was quite enjoyable.
[48:58.220 --> 48:59.640]  Let me see how long Mouse Hunt is.
[49:00.300 --> 49:00.820]  That's what I feel about...
[49:00.820 --> 49:02.100]  Are you looking or do you want me to?
[49:02.300 --> 49:06.460]  Mouse Hunt, are you saying you haven't seen like Home Alone 3 or whatever?
[49:06.620 --> 49:07.160]  Mouse Hunt in a while.
[49:07.320 --> 49:10.080]  I have remembered Home Alone 3 and 4 and 5.
[49:10.180 --> 49:13.520]  Like, I know I've seen those and the bar is low on those.
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.320]  You liked Home Alone 5 a lot more than I did, though.
[49:16.780 --> 49:17.820]  I did. I thought it was charming.
[49:18.400 --> 49:19.240]  Yeah, I didn't see.
[49:19.320 --> 49:20.720]  I didn't personally like it at all.
[49:20.840 --> 49:25.040]  So I think maybe my bar is lower for clearing than yours for Mouse Hunt.
[49:25.700 --> 49:27.080]  Being the third best.
[49:27.920 --> 49:28.800]  We'll have to watch and find out.
[49:28.800 --> 49:29.440]  How long is Mouse Hunt?
[49:29.920 --> 49:30.640]  19 minutes.
[49:30.640 --> 49:32.180]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.020]  God, that's awesome.
[49:33.060 --> 49:35.820]  God, that's just when you think it gets going, it's done.
[49:35.940 --> 49:36.700]  That's awesome.
[49:36.920 --> 49:40.340]  The only way it could be better if it was 89 minutes, but 98 is good too.
[49:40.400 --> 49:41.580]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[49:41.620 --> 49:42.320]  I agree with you.
[49:43.460 --> 49:48.640]  If I see a movie that is less than 90 minutes, I know it's bad in a way that's fun.
[49:49.520 --> 49:54.740]  If they can't reach 90 minutes, it's just there's nothing there.
[49:55.080 --> 49:55.600]  So right.
[49:55.600 --> 50:01.220]  When I was a kid, my grandparents subscribed to this Reader's Digest condensed book series,
[50:01.500 --> 50:05.160]  and you would just get like books that were cut down, you know,
[50:05.220 --> 50:06.480]  but you would get most of the book.
[50:06.820 --> 50:08.820]  They would just cut out all the faff, I guess.
[50:09.200 --> 50:09.900]  What's the point of that?
[50:09.920 --> 50:10.760]  I always thought that...
[50:10.760 --> 50:11.400]  Same, dude.
[50:11.460 --> 50:13.480]  I always thought that was such a fucking lame way to read.
[50:13.600 --> 50:14.320]  I was like, ew.
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.600]  But now that I want that for movies, I want the 80 minute cut of every...
[50:18.600 --> 50:20.660]  I want to see the 80 minute cut of Interstellar.
[50:20.840 --> 50:21.560]  Then I'll watch it.
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.040]  That's so... it's art though.
[50:23.120 --> 50:24.620]  It's like it completely destroys it.
[50:24.620 --> 50:26.920]  What if the Mona Lisa was 80% painted?
[50:27.260 --> 50:28.280]  Why would you want to see that?
[50:28.680 --> 50:30.880]  I don't want to see it 100% painted.
[50:31.160 --> 50:31.760]  Yeah, that's true.
[50:32.020 --> 50:34.400]  And that's what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is.
[50:34.500 --> 50:38.780]  It's 88 minutes long, and that might as well be 80% done.
[50:39.920 --> 50:40.880]  That's insane.
[50:41.120 --> 50:42.740]  It's under 90 minutes.
[50:42.800 --> 50:44.200]  A movie under 90 minutes.
[50:44.780 --> 50:46.800]  Oh, that's so great.
[50:47.380 --> 50:48.340]  That's... Jeff, I'm with you.
[50:48.420 --> 50:49.100]  Condense everything.
[50:49.340 --> 50:50.180]  Let's get going, man.
[50:50.260 --> 50:53.960]  I watched some of the Vanilla Ice movie while I was on vacation too.
[50:53.960 --> 50:55.560]  I'd never seen it cold as ice.
[50:55.880 --> 50:57.120]  I think that's what it's called.
[50:57.480 --> 50:58.020]  Not good.
[50:58.540 --> 50:58.840]  No.
[50:58.980 --> 50:59.420]  Throw that out there.
[50:59.460 --> 50:59.760]  Yeah.
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.680]  Couldn't finish it, but I watched about 20 minutes.
[51:01.680 --> 51:03.280]  He's got a motorcycle, right?
[51:03.400 --> 51:04.360]  Like, that's like his whole thing.
[51:04.700 --> 51:08.280]  And he and his buddies are traveling through, and then the motorcycle breaks, and they're
[51:08.280 --> 51:09.060]  trying to get it fixed.
[51:09.080 --> 51:12.100]  And then the mechanic takes all the motorcycle apart, and they're like, it's going to take
[51:12.100 --> 51:13.320]  forever to get put back together.
[51:13.560 --> 51:15.720]  And then Ione Skye is somehow into him.
[51:15.840 --> 51:18.420]  And then there's a high school dance, and she has a boyfriend.
[51:18.480 --> 51:19.600]  He doesn't like Vanilla Ice.
[51:19.780 --> 51:23.380]  And yeah, I think Michael Gross is her dad from Family Ties.
[51:23.380 --> 51:25.140]  And he may or may not be involved with the Mafia.
[51:25.260 --> 51:27.240]  I didn't hang around long enough to see how that worked out.
[51:27.340 --> 51:27.660]  But yeah.
[51:27.980 --> 51:29.900]  Does he have one of the squarest heads in entertainment?
[51:30.440 --> 51:31.180]  Oh, it's pretty square.
[51:31.580 --> 51:32.220]  That's a good call.
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.240]  Maybe we should do a square head draft.
[51:34.980 --> 51:36.360]  Do you think that's the...
[51:37.620 --> 51:37.720]  What?
[51:37.960 --> 51:38.100]  All right.
[51:38.260 --> 51:38.760]  How about this?
[51:38.880 --> 51:47.560]  Who do you think has achieved the most success from the least volume of release that then
[51:47.560 --> 51:48.060]  flamed out?
[51:48.160 --> 51:51.800]  Like, Vanilla Ice was on top of the world for one song very briefly.
[51:51.800 --> 51:53.560]  The other day on Reddit, I had no idea.
[51:53.820 --> 51:55.040]  This is how popular he was.
[51:55.240 --> 51:57.040]  He briefly dated Madonna.
[51:57.800 --> 51:59.980]  Like, at the height of his career, he was dating Madonna.
[52:00.300 --> 52:03.480]  And now he's like a professional jet skier, I think.
[52:04.120 --> 52:04.560]  Is he really?
[52:04.900 --> 52:05.880]  I think he was for a while.
[52:06.200 --> 52:08.160]  He does, like, house renovation shit.
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.540]  Yeah, he does house renovation stuff as well.
[52:11.180 --> 52:16.080]  To go from, like, nobody's ever heard of him, to being dangled off a building by Suge Knight,
[52:16.080 --> 52:22.780]  to dating Madonna, to being a punchline, essentially, for a lot of people.
[52:23.040 --> 52:25.380]  Yeah, but he's still in popular culture.
[52:25.860 --> 52:26.300]  Of course.
[52:26.540 --> 52:26.720]  Yeah.
[52:27.340 --> 52:30.460]  I think Kevin Federline probably has to be up there.
[52:30.720 --> 52:32.000]  That's another one.
[52:32.060 --> 52:35.320]  Because he didn't even do anything.
[52:35.940 --> 52:37.560]  He didn't have a song.
[52:37.720 --> 52:40.940]  Well, he had a song called Popo's Owl, but he didn't have a charting song.
[52:41.360 --> 52:42.020]  You know what I mean?
[52:42.420 --> 52:42.740]  Interesting.
[52:43.360 --> 52:44.440]  Was he a backup dancer?
[52:44.920 --> 52:45.880]  He was a backup dancer.
[52:45.880 --> 52:49.320]  But I think the thing that was interesting about him was that he was like,
[52:49.400 --> 52:50.960]  okay, I'm just going to take these kids and go raise them.
[52:51.700 --> 52:51.720]  Sure.
[52:51.820 --> 52:54.440]  And I think that's what he did after he couldn't, like,
[52:55.220 --> 52:59.720]  parlay his divorce from Britney into any more, like, I don't know, pop culture success.
[52:59.720 --> 53:03.820]  He just became a dad from everything I can tell, and just devoted himself to raising the kids.
[53:04.560 --> 53:06.940]  That's just shit I've read on Celebrity Gossip.
[53:07.020 --> 53:08.300]  I don't know how true that is, but...
[53:08.300 --> 53:09.840]  For me, it's talk to a girl.
[53:11.040 --> 53:11.680]  I feel like...
[53:11.680 --> 53:12.500]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[53:12.740 --> 53:13.140]  Yeah.
[53:13.660 --> 53:15.860]  Fame for, like, least amount of money.
[53:15.860 --> 53:17.020]  Mm-hmm.
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.020]  Even better.
[53:18.300 --> 53:22.980]  She said a quote in somebody else's video and then became a thing.
[53:23.320 --> 53:24.500]  And then became a crypto scammer.
[53:24.780 --> 53:25.200]  Yes.
[53:25.960 --> 53:29.060]  Well, you know, some of us have our money tied up in that crypto,
[53:29.180 --> 53:32.780]  and we're looking for it to kind of turn around and get back to where it was before.
[53:32.940 --> 53:35.400]  So let's not, you know, scammer is such a strong word.
[53:35.580 --> 53:36.180]  Let's, you know...
[53:36.180 --> 53:36.820]  Scam is, yeah.
[53:36.820 --> 53:39.460]  I say it's a crypto wait-and-see-er.
[53:39.780 --> 53:40.460]  That's how I feel.
[53:42.160 --> 53:44.020]  It's a crypto jury still out.
[53:44.020 --> 53:46.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:46.740 --> 53:49.360]  Crypto rug is still exactly where it was.
[53:49.480 --> 53:50.900]  Nobody pulled it, not even once.
[53:52.500 --> 53:53.480]  Here's the thing about a rug.
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.040]  You can pull it and then you can put it back.
[53:55.260 --> 53:55.980]  That's how rugs work.
[53:56.300 --> 53:56.840]  You just put that rug right back.
[53:56.900 --> 53:57.920]  That's the point of a rug.
[53:58.060 --> 53:58.640]  It's not a carpet.
[53:59.180 --> 53:59.280]  It's a rug.
[53:59.420 --> 54:00.080]  Put it back.
[54:00.440 --> 54:01.220]  Put the rug back.
[54:01.340 --> 54:01.900]  Talk to a girl.
[54:01.900 --> 54:02.800]  Put the rug back.
[54:03.820 --> 54:04.540]  She's going to put the...
[54:04.540 --> 54:05.140]  It's just clean.
[54:05.280 --> 54:07.120]  The rug isn't permanently gone.
[54:07.200 --> 54:08.620]  It's just being cleaned.
[54:08.960 --> 54:09.160]  It's being cleaned.
[54:09.180 --> 54:11.960]  Have you ever seen those clips of events where there's like a red carpet
[54:11.960 --> 54:15.820]  and for some reason a car pulls up and like brakes on it and everyone on the carpet goes flying?
[54:16.620 --> 54:19.440]  I've never seen a clip of that outside of like a movie.
[54:20.320 --> 54:22.360]  I've never seen that happen in real life.
[54:22.960 --> 54:25.640]  People keep trying to put cars on rugs and stuff.
[54:26.780 --> 54:30.660]  People keep trying to put cars on rugs and stuff.
[54:30.760 --> 54:33.080]  Or like long red carpets on stages and things.
[54:33.460 --> 54:34.540]  Oh, OK.
[54:34.840 --> 54:36.120]  I thought you meant like...
[54:37.880 --> 54:40.320]  Like people are just doing this.
[54:40.540 --> 54:41.540]  Yeah, they're not doing it for a laugh.
[54:41.540 --> 54:43.500]  They're just like, oh, let's unveil this car.
[54:43.580 --> 54:43.940]  Look at it.
[54:44.120 --> 54:45.880]  And then it drives off and everyone goes flying.
[54:47.500 --> 54:49.440]  You know the cool thing about a rug?
[54:50.100 --> 54:54.120]  It could conceal a bog roll folder pretty easily and no one would ever know.
[54:54.480 --> 54:54.660]  Dude.
[54:55.000 --> 54:55.420]  Wow.
[54:56.620 --> 55:00.040]  Maybe if you've got a big household, the bog roll folder quilt comes into play.
[55:03.140 --> 55:06.260]  Speaking of movies, bad movies especially,
[55:06.700 --> 55:10.980]  are there any movies that you wish you watched before you realized movies could be bad?
[55:12.540 --> 55:13.360]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[55:13.360 --> 55:14.700]  What do you mean before you realize?
[55:14.900 --> 55:17.640]  When you're so when you're younger, I think we've talked about this before.
[55:17.660 --> 55:22.540]  Like as a kid, there's definitely a point in my life where I was watching media and content
[55:22.540 --> 55:24.020]  and none of it was bad.
[55:24.060 --> 55:24.700]  It was all good.
[55:24.820 --> 55:27.940]  Like I just didn't I couldn't process it being bad.
[55:28.460 --> 55:34.400]  I wish I could go back and enjoy certain movies in the way I did when I was young.
[55:34.780 --> 55:35.180]  Interesting.
[55:35.380 --> 55:38.380]  The first movie that comes to mind is a movie called The Explorers.
[55:38.380 --> 55:39.080]  Okay.
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.600]  With a guy, I think it had a what's his face? He's dead now.
[55:43.940 --> 55:45.980]  River Phoenix in it, I think was the main character.
[55:46.080 --> 55:51.020]  And it's about some kids who build a spaceship in their backyard and they go to space.
[55:51.160 --> 55:54.260]  And then they find out that the aliens that summoned them were
[55:54.740 --> 55:57.420]  kids on a joyride, like alien kids on a joyride.
[55:57.840 --> 55:59.420]  And I love that movie.
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.120]  I saw oh, and I think that's what's his face? Mikey from the Goonies as well in there.
[56:06.300 --> 56:08.140]  But oh, and that's Ethan Hawke.
[56:08.140 --> 56:09.040]  I think is the other kid.
[56:09.160 --> 56:12.080]  Oh, well, it's a pretty star studded cast.
[56:12.960 --> 56:16.460]  But I saw it a couple of years ago and it's it's reprehensibly bad.
[56:16.540 --> 56:19.040]  But when I was a kid, I watched only three times and it was magic.
[56:19.540 --> 56:20.460]  That sounds great.
[56:21.400 --> 56:27.200]  I've been watching the new way I watch movies is I'll think of an actor that I'm interested in
[56:27.200 --> 56:33.560]  or like I just they'll come up and thought and I'll search their name across every streaming
[56:33.560 --> 56:38.960]  service I have and then I'll just lock into watching every movie of theirs I haven't seen
[56:38.960 --> 56:40.820]  that's available on that service.
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.640]  And I'm doing that with Tom Cruise at the moment.
[56:44.960 --> 56:47.100]  And I've never fully seen Cocktail.
[56:47.500 --> 56:49.940]  And I know Cocktail is supposed to be terrible.
[56:50.240 --> 56:50.760]  Dog shit.
[56:50.980 --> 56:55.360]  Oh, that but as a kid, it is a film I saw on TV a few times.
[56:55.780 --> 56:58.040]  I remember thinking, oh, this is a good movie
[56:58.040 --> 57:01.440]  because everybody likes him in the movie from what I've seen.
[57:01.440 --> 57:04.360]  It's a movie where everyone is like, this guy is really cool.
[57:04.440 --> 57:05.700]  Everything he's doing is really cool.
[57:05.900 --> 57:08.940]  So as a small child, I went, oh, this is really cool.
[57:09.240 --> 57:13.280]  And now I'm going to have to watch this as an adult based on what I'm doing.
[57:13.720 --> 57:15.940]  And I just know it's going to be dreadful.
[57:16.220 --> 57:19.820]  Let me know how that goes, because I also remember it being a very cool movie where
[57:19.820 --> 57:23.480]  he flipped bottles in the air and he had he smiled and everybody liked him.
[57:23.820 --> 57:25.140]  And he was like a cool dude.
[57:25.240 --> 57:30.300]  So it's going to be delayed because I started it last night and then realized
[57:30.300 --> 57:34.240]  that the streaming service it was on only has it available in French,
[57:34.400 --> 57:36.500]  which is a very annoying problem.
[57:37.040 --> 57:38.460]  Except the thing that happens.
[57:39.700 --> 57:41.680]  No, they're only French as well.
[57:42.020 --> 57:42.800]  They are French.
[57:42.860 --> 57:44.320]  God, not good.
[57:45.100 --> 57:46.120]  Can't consume it.
[57:47.100 --> 57:51.740]  I was actually I started it fully paused and I was like, oh, the subtitles aren't working.
[57:52.100 --> 57:54.840]  And then it was a bunch of French words.
[57:54.880 --> 57:56.960]  And I went, oh, fuck, it's one of these.
[57:57.700 --> 58:02.380]  Because Rocky five, it's the same thing where I've watched all the Rocky movies, but five
[58:02.380 --> 58:07.860]  because Rocky five for some reason is only available in French on their streaming service.
[58:08.700 --> 58:10.260]  So I just can't see it.
[58:10.540 --> 58:13.480]  Have you tried buying the movie, the disc?
[58:13.580 --> 58:14.280]  Oh, yeah.
[58:14.440 --> 58:20.220]  I'm trying to be very mindful of money at the moment and trying to be fully responsible.
[58:20.360 --> 58:22.680]  So I'm just streaming whatever I can.
[58:23.280 --> 58:26.540]  So it's a thing where I see like, oh, it's part of my cable bundle.
[58:26.540 --> 58:27.700]  The streaming service.
[58:28.180 --> 58:29.220]  Great. I'll watch it.
[58:29.340 --> 58:30.680]  And then it's just French only.
[58:31.260 --> 58:33.760]  So instead, I watch Risky Business last night because I could.
[58:33.900 --> 58:34.400]  Good movie.
[58:35.320 --> 58:36.680]  It is a stressful movie.
[58:37.140 --> 58:38.440]  Yeah, I didn't.
[58:38.500 --> 58:40.160]  I thought it was supposed to be just a comedy.
[58:40.440 --> 58:44.080]  And I spent most of it going, I don't I don't really find this funny.
[58:44.460 --> 58:47.180]  I just am incredibly stressed by everything happening.
[58:47.640 --> 58:48.640]  It's kind of a dark film.
[58:50.400 --> 58:53.740]  Yeah, but I don't think within the film it's viewed that way.
[58:54.380 --> 58:56.340]  Yeah, I think it's pretty lighthearted.
[58:56.340 --> 58:59.320]  And isn't that Joe Pantaleone in it?
[58:59.380 --> 58:59.720]  It is.
[58:59.860 --> 59:02.440]  Yeah, Joey, Joey Pants and Risky Business.
[59:02.720 --> 59:04.320]  I'm trying to go. I haven't seen that movie in a long time.
[59:04.360 --> 59:07.160]  But like Rebecca de Mornay is the love interest.
[59:07.160 --> 59:09.980]  And she's like, is she a escort or something?
[59:10.100 --> 59:10.440]  Yes.
[59:10.800 --> 59:11.100]  Yeah.
[59:11.300 --> 59:11.680]  Yeah.
[59:12.360 --> 59:18.500]  She's an escort that keeps stealing from him when he leaves because he leaves her at her house
[59:18.500 --> 59:20.780]  unattended and then she'll take something and leave.
[59:21.100 --> 59:23.220]  And his parents are out of town the whole time, right?
[59:23.220 --> 59:26.620]  Yeah, the whole thing is that his parents are out of town and he's trying to
[59:27.220 --> 59:31.540]  get a crystal egg back that she stole before they get home.
[59:31.740 --> 59:33.120]  And then things escalate.
[59:33.280 --> 59:33.660]  Right.
[59:34.200 --> 59:37.660]  It it has his best friend. I don't remember his name.
[59:37.960 --> 59:41.100]  And he's an actor that I've always thought looks kind of odd.
[59:41.780 --> 59:42.980]  He's kind of an odd appearance.
[59:43.260 --> 59:46.220]  And I've never seen him from this era of film.
[59:46.620 --> 59:49.240]  And he looks relatively normal in this.
[59:49.320 --> 59:52.240]  I went, wow, this is the most normal I've seen this guy look.
[59:52.960 --> 59:53.860]  Who I'm looking at?
[59:53.900 --> 59:54.040]  Which guy?
[59:54.600 --> 59:57.320]  He plays his best friend in the movie.
[59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.300]  I don't remember his real acting name.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.580]  Is it Curtis Armstrong?
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.720]  I think so.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.160]  Or Bronson Pinchot?
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.560]  Curtis Armstrong, booger from, yeah, from Revenge of the Nerds.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.200]  Curtis Armstrong in Risky Business is the most normal I think I've ever seen Curtis Armstrong
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.000]  look. And that's typically seeing him in movies from the 2000s.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.460]  I've never seen him from like a 80s movie.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.160]  Yeah, he was in Better Off Dead and One Crazy Summer.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.880]  He was in like every John Cusack like teen comedy in the 80s.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.880]  He is in a category of actor for me that is like Ron Howard's brother, Clint Howard.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.960]  Like it's it's a group of the guy from Princess Bride.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:36.780]  He was like, meow.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:37.540]  Yeah.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.760]  And I drink the boy.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.260]  Whatever.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.200]  That was that was like Nick doing the voice.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:50.020]  But it's it was funny just watching this movie, Jeff.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.700]  I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be funny or if it was just stressful,
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.400]  like the tone of it, because it's 80s.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.060]  It's very 80s humor, I think.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.580]  Yeah, I think it was probably funnier in the 80s than it is now in 2025 for sure.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.540]  Hey, Andrew, that reminds me, you and I have a movie date we need to schedule pretty soon
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.020]  because I watch Terminator Genisys and now you and I are going to watch Dark Fate together.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:15.900]  I can't wait.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.280]  And I can complete my Terminator movie watch through.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.780]  I am so excited.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.220]  By the way, that fucking franchise.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.680]  So they did Terminator one and then Terminator two, and then they made Terminator three.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.000]  Right.
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.680]  And then after Terminator three, they decided to relaunch the series.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.080]  They did a soft reboot with Terminator Salvation.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.500]  OK, that movie sucked.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:46.420]  So they rebooted the series again and threw all of that away to make Terminator Genisys.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:52.620]  They hated that movie so much that they threw all of that away and did another full reboot
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.600]  with Dark Fate.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:58.860]  Has any other film had three reboots in a row back to back to back?
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.560]  Any franchise?
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.600]  That's crazy.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:02.700]  Jurassic?
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:03.400]  No.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.040]  No.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:09.340]  Can you imagine, though, if James Cameron just decided I'm going to make Terminator three
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.260]  and it just fuck all the others?
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.960]  Yeah, it just continues from where two left off.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:14.820]  I think it'd be awesome.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.440]  Oh, Halloween. Halloween did that.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.000]  Oh, yeah. Halloween reboots a lot.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:27.360]  I think that if you make a sequel, you can't, you shouldn't be allowed to be able to go back
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.480]  and be like, well, that actually one, that one didn't happen.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.620]  And we're writing it out of the canon.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.700]  I don't think you should be allowed to do that.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.460]  You certainly shouldn't be able to do it every two years with a major theatrical release.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:44.400]  Yeah, I just I'm so sick of the producer interview or whatever that's like,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.860]  actually, hey, guys, that last one.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.180]  Sorry, but this one's for the fans.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.440]  You're like this. You made the last one.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.040]  This is going to suck shit also.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.700]  And it does every time.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:56.620]  Awful, terrible.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.360]  God, I guess.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.960]  And I guess it would be similar is like, I don't know who the fuck is the Joker or
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.460]  Batman or Superman anymore.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.520]  Every time I look at it, it's a different actor.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.720]  Like, I don't know who the who is supposed to be Batman right now.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.480]  Is it Robert Pattinson?
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.860]  Who's supposed to be Superman?
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.020]  Because I saw a Superman trailer for the new James Gunn movie, and it's definitely not
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:14.660]  what's his face.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.800]  It's somebody else.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.760]  And I'm so confused by it all.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.560]  Cavill's out.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.980]  Cavill is out.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.280]  And the guy from Twisted is in.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.280]  Oh, yeah, it's the guy.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.020]  The guy that's like wearing the sunglasses.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.520]  He's on like the bad side.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.340]  And he's like, oh, he wears like the polo the whole time or whatever.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.480]  He's that Superman.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.200]  The guy who was like her friend.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.640]  And then he went to the dark side.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.880]  Not not him.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.200]  The guy that's with him.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:38.700]  With him.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:38.960]  OK.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.300]  Yeah.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:39.740]  Yeah.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.260]  His homie in that part.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.100]  Yeah, that's that's Superman.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:43.520]  Weird.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:44.060]  Very.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.320]  This kind of remind me of the thought I had this morning about Terminator.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.820]  Terminator are some great movies.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:59.660]  It feels like properties, TV shows or movies can kind of take flight based off of one incredibly
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.360]  well done thing, and then they just coast.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.100]  They can just coast on mediocrity for a long time.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.420]  And I couldn't think of a show that is more that than Dexter.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.140]  So they're doing a new Dexter show right now.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.820]  That's like a reboot of not even a reboot.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.540]  It's like a prequel series.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.440]  And it just looks like everybody is cosplaying as their favorite Dexter characters.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.200]  Yeah, because it's them all younger.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.860]  Like, it's just ridiculous.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:31.400]  And I think Dexter has like one point five good seasons of show, but they keep making
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.360]  more Dexter and they're doing another season of Dexter after that.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.180]  Like they were they set up, I guess, spoilers, whoever cares.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:45.160]  And this is sort of part of my thought of is there anybody who is watching Dexter now
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.980]  for the first time?
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.300]  I mean, like, I got to watch Dexter.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.620]  Like, it has to just all be people that watched it as it was airing.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.180]  Like, I feel stuck where I'm probably going to watch this Dexter prequel show because
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.680]  I've seen all the other seasons of Dexter.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.940]  So you're wondering who all the Dexter heads out there that are clamoring for more Dexter.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:10.700]  It's just like they they killed him in the most recent season.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.300]  And then the actor was like, you know what?
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.460]  I had fun doing that.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.420]  Can we bring him back?
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:21.200]  And so then this show, they're doing a prequel where they explain it is both a prequel and
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.660]  an explanation for how he didn't die in the last season.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:30.720]  And they scrapped where they were going because they set it up to be like his kid was going
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.260]  to be the new star of a spinoff.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.340]  And they canceled that so they can just do more Dexter.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.120]  But it's just like, who is watching this?
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:43.340]  I hate it with the with prequels where they where they think like, oh, we need to explain
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.140]  every single thing about this character.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.080]  We need the origin of everything to have like with like it's like, oh, what's your name?
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:50.860]  Han.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.240]  Oh, are you with anyone?
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.240]  No.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:53.540]  OK.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.500]  Solo then.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.360]  It's like, oh, is everyone is half the people in the room solo now?
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:58.820]  Yeah, it's so...
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:05:59.640]  Gavin, you're so fucking right.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.460]  Why would you explain that?
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.820]  Why can't it just be his name?
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:02.380]  Yep.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.360]  Who cares?
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.660]  Who cares?
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.320]  It just feels like they're filling time.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.220]  But then also movies are two hours and 40 minutes.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.020]  And it's like, why this take this part out?
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.000]  You shot it.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:13.800]  You shouldn't have shot it.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.620]  That's your mistake.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:15.820]  Take this out.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.640]  Like, it makes sense if there's like a thing.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.040]  It's like if a character has a scar, maybe you could show that.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.660]  Or if he has like a certain prop or a piece of equipment that he finds.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.380]  But you don't need to explain every single goddamn thing.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.900]  It becomes a problem as a viewer of like, what do I want?
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.260]  In what order do I watch this now?
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:32.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.520]  Should I be watching this first?
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.480]  Because it's before everything else?
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.740]  Or does it not make sense?
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.540]  Because they're assuming that you've seen the other stuff.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.780]  Even though this is before like it.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.060]  God, I hate it.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.080]  I hate it so much.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.400]  I'm definitely not going to see the Dexter prequel because I fell off a Dexter in season
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.140]  two, I think.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.160]  But I love that they're like the way they're advertising, because I see the advertisements
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.760]  constantly on Hulu where it's like Christian Slater and Patrick Dempsey and Sarah Michelle
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.580]  Galar and the voice of Michael C. Clark.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.720]  It's like, wow, we get his whole voice.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.240]  Awesome.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.700]  I was hoping to listen to him.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:10.860]  Jesus Christ.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.940]  It made me think I was trying to think of like, I think I have the reverse of a commitment
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:22.200]  issue where if I'm watching a show for more than one season, I'm just I'm going to ride
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.760]  with you is I don't care how bad it gets.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.020]  I'm getting to the end.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:30.720]  The only show I could think of that I broke up with while it was airing was The Walking
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.020]  Dead.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.160]  I just couldn't.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.360]  Oh, yeah, I broke up with that.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.200]  I just threw in the towel after like six seasons.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:36.960]  That's not on you.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.020]  That's not on you, man.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:38.560]  That's on them.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.320]  100%.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.460]  How far did you make it?
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:48.520]  I don't know what season this was, but it was the one where a woman is in a coffin and
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.420]  like zombifies herself in an attempt to kill a different character.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:58.620]  And the finale ends with them like opening the they open the coffin to like reveal that
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.140]  she's being held hostage or something, and then she pops out as a zombie and is like,
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.660]  ah, I don't expect that.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.420]  Maybe that came after.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:06.940]  That was the governor.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:07.580]  Is it?
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.760]  Yeah, it was related to the governor.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.660]  Yeah, that was Angela.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:11.840]  I don't remember.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:12.060]  Yeah.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.400]  What season would that have been?
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.660]  Yeah, I don't know what season that was, but that's when I stopped.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.800]  What if we make the first podcast prequel?
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.240]  Oh, let's make a pre face podcast.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.920]  I think I sort of.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.140]  Rooster teeth.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.020]  Oh, I've had Gavin.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.260]  I have an idea that I haven't talked to you about this sort of this.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.560]  I've talked to you on the idealist.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.360]  Yeah, I need to put it.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.280]  Now he's about to say it.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:40.920]  Why?
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.840]  OK, no, but say it.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:49.300]  The idea was I I've been listening to old I noticed on Spotify.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:56.000]  They had Abbott and Costello radio programming from the 40s, just on Spotify.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.740]  And so I've been listening to it, just being like, this is what people listen to.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.040]  And it made me think of what face would have been if it came out in the 40s
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.340]  and that we should do like a five minute.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:15.640]  Like what face slash regulation podcast would sound like if it was set in the 1940s?
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.380]  Like edit it for the 40s?
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:19.340]  Like edit it in that style.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.140]  And also like that, the way they deliver comedy where it's like sound effects.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:28.660]  And it's also like everything is set up punchline, set up punchline, set up punchline.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.860]  Like it's not free flowing.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:36.900]  Think about movies that I think Psycho was it was the first movie to have a toilet flush in it.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.460]  I was just like something that wasn't done, like you don't show toilet and stuff.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.780]  And then somehow we ended up with like
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.940]  Jackass 3 where Dave England shitting through a fucking shit in a volcano with his arsehole.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:53.240]  I was like the 60s to then is not a ton of time.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:58.620]  It was it's funny to listen to because it is less polished than you would assume.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.260]  Oh, because it's live, I assume.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.560]  I yeah, I would. I think it must have been because they will struggle to get words out
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:11.780]  and they also will flub sometimes and it'll be if they do it really bad, then they acknowledge it.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.960]  And it's just it's funny because everything else is so produced around them.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:22.220]  And then it's just them struggling and sometimes I assume it's all laugh track,
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.000]  but like they will make jokes and there will be no laugh track to the joke that was said,
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:32.120]  which makes it feel like it just didn't land or that like the timing was off for it.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.360]  It's very odd, but I thought it would be funny to try to do like a regulation podcast
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.400]  Abbott and Costello style where it's just everything is set up in that way and there's
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.900]  sound effects. I would love to see what that what that would sound like.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.260]  Because it's weird like reading about radio in the 40s that, you know, like you think of
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:58.580]  podcasting as a version of radio expanding, but that how much of radio at a certain time
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:05.320]  turned into television, how it went from like TV, radio, and then those shows became TV shows
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:10.120]  and then eventually like program radio programming changed and shifted
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:16.140]  evolved into what became podcasting. But do you think we're at a low point if you were to graph
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:19.480]  like how good stuff is over time? What do you mean? Sorry.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.320]  Just like we're talking podcasts to talk about far in.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.520]  Yeah. Do you think we as a podcaster or as a society?
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:27.920]  Just this podcast.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.600]  I don't know. I feel like this is I was thinking this was like an eight episode.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.240]  It's fine. Why don't we wait to hear the verdict of this episode through a voice memo from from
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:46.180]  Eric? Oh. Should be should be coming through any time. Yeah, you set that up like you had one ready.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.100]  Yeah. What happened? I just wanted to put him on the spot.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.940]  I was really expecting you to say the audience to what the audience thinks.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.660]  And then you said voice memo from Eric.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.860]  Can I take my eight back? We were at an eight, but you just fucking took it down to seven.
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.300]  It's funny you say that because here is Eric's voice memo.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.200]  Honestly. 7.8.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.620]  This is your fault. You fucked up.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.480]  Well, he's right. There you have it. It was a good episode until Gavin fucked up.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:28.580]  Not the first episode of the year, but definitely the first episode we recorded in 2025. I have
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.620]  missed you all terribly. I spent the last seven days just daydreaming about all the stuff we're
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:38.100]  going to film and record together this year and then writing it all down. I couldn't be more
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:44.080]  excited for our first full year as a company. 2025 is going to be a banner year for regulation.
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:50.080]  I'm saying it now. It's going to it's only going to get fucking wilder and dumber and more fun and
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:55.000]  more stupid and more farty and grosser. And I can't wait. And I hope the audience will be there
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.180]  for us as well. If you enjoyed this episode, please tell a friend or a co-worker, maybe somebody
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:04.280]  who used to listen to Rooster Teeth, who doesn't know that we have a podcast somehow, because I
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.340]  still keep running into people constantly that are like, oh, what's regulation? I thought you were
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:11.760]  done. Like, no, I didn't die. We're still making stuff. Check it out. We'd love for you to come
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:18.300]  along for the ride. And it's going to be a bumpy, gross, fun ride. Five stars. Rate and review. Bye
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:26.020]  bye. Do we need to tailsynch or no? Yeah. Yeah, you definitely do. That's the other thing that I
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:30.520]  said. Remind me to tell you something. We did that whole thing. I zoned out. I didn't actually. I said
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.940]  one. I said one, but I'm not sure I got it right. So we should definitely tailsynch. That's better
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:35.400]  than three.
