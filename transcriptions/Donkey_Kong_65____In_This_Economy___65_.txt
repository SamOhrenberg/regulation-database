[00:00.000 --> 00:04.460]  I'm a kid. So am I going to surprise you with a poster board I need for the science fair tomorrow?
[00:04.720 --> 00:08.940]  Probably. But can you get up to 40% off back to school essentials on Uber Eats?
[00:09.180 --> 00:13.100]  Definitely. So order on Uber Eats and get up to 40% off.
[00:13.400 --> 00:14.780]  Exclusions may apply. Check out for availability.
[00:15.260 --> 00:20.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast. This is number 65.
[00:20.540 --> 00:23.680]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Banton, Gavin Freed, Nick Schwartz,
[00:23.780 --> 00:25.660]  Eric Baddour. Hello, boys.
[00:25.980 --> 00:26.240]  Hello.
[00:26.840 --> 00:28.040]  What's the best 65 thing?
[00:28.040 --> 00:34.560]  If you could have 65 of anything, what would be the best 65 thing that isn't just like gold bars?
[00:35.480 --> 00:41.060]  Isn't there a like Thunder Kiss 65 or something like a Rob Zombie song?
[00:41.320 --> 00:44.920]  Is there? I don't know anything. I only know Rob Zombie's film career.
[00:45.280 --> 00:47.540]  I couldn't tell you anything about his music.
[00:50.760 --> 00:55.180]  Honestly, honestly, if you told him that, I think he would be like thrilled.
[00:55.500 --> 00:57.220]  I think he would be so stoked on that.
[00:57.220 --> 01:04.380]  He was like, oh, well, let's let's avoid my opinions on 90% of his work.
[01:04.420 --> 01:08.680]  But yeah, I was about to say, which mediocre lane do you want to do?
[01:08.700 --> 01:09.820]  Do you want to go in there with him?
[01:10.220 --> 01:13.560]  I enjoyed the Devil's Rejects, but like everything else.
[01:13.780 --> 01:15.920]  I liked one shot of that movie. That was about it.
[01:16.320 --> 01:18.860]  I like Walton Goggins in the first movie. He's good.
[01:18.920 --> 01:20.920]  Yeah. Walton Goggins was cool.
[01:21.580 --> 01:22.980]  He's great. I mean, he's great and everything.
[01:23.480 --> 01:24.320]  65, though.
[01:26.380 --> 01:29.100]  What would you not? I wouldn't want 65.
[01:29.100 --> 01:33.020]  I was trying to think 65 frogs, but I think I wouldn't want 65 frogs.
[01:33.100 --> 01:34.080]  That'd be too many frogs.
[01:34.720 --> 01:36.080]  See, my first thing was bananas.
[01:36.400 --> 01:39.260]  I wouldn't want 65 bananas, but I've been playing a lot of Donkey Kong,
[01:39.360 --> 01:42.120]  so I feel like that goes against my current want.
[01:42.500 --> 01:43.140]  It's weird.
[01:43.420 --> 01:46.520]  I don't like bananas, but I feel a desire to have bananas right now.
[01:46.860 --> 01:49.020]  And in my head, it's a sequel to Donkey Kong 64.
[01:49.180 --> 01:50.940]  So it is, in fact, Donkey Kong 65.
[01:53.420 --> 01:54.100]  Oh, honestly.
[01:54.260 --> 01:55.780]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.680]  Also, that's the first half of the title for this episode is Donkey Kong 65.
[02:02.960 --> 02:04.600]  Trixie was dual wielding back then.
[02:04.640 --> 02:05.740]  What are we going to do for the sequel?
[02:05.880 --> 02:06.660]  What are we going to promote?
[02:06.780 --> 02:07.900]  It's the big new thing.
[02:09.040 --> 02:12.600]  Try wielding quad wielding deck a wield deck.
[02:12.680 --> 02:13.480]  Well, they are there.
[02:13.560 --> 02:14.140]  They're monkeys.
[02:14.240 --> 02:15.380]  They can hold guns in their feet.
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.740]  They get on their tail.
[02:17.060 --> 02:17.700]  Tail gun.
[02:18.560 --> 02:18.700]  Yeah.
[02:18.700 --> 02:21.740]  Could a chimp hold five guns if he used all legs and a tail?
[02:22.080 --> 02:22.780]  No, no.
[02:22.860 --> 02:23.740]  Chimp doesn't have a tail.
[02:24.560 --> 02:24.740]  Oh, wait.
[02:24.820 --> 02:25.620]  Well, does it not?
[02:26.620 --> 02:28.180]  Does Trixie not have a tail?
[02:28.480 --> 02:29.160]  That's a good point.
[02:29.220 --> 02:30.680]  They just got those red arses, don't they?
[02:30.940 --> 02:31.440]  Or is that a different?
[02:31.500 --> 02:32.120]  That's a baboon.
[02:33.740 --> 02:36.780]  See the back side of a lot of these primates.
[02:36.980 --> 02:39.240]  I get all tangled up in each other.
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.160]  You're you're telling me you're telling me you want one of these guys to hold a gun.
[02:45.180 --> 02:46.520]  You got didn't got no tail, dude.
[02:46.860 --> 02:47.840]  I could hold four guns, though.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.840]  He can.
[02:48.920 --> 02:50.120]  But you said five with a tail.
[02:50.440 --> 02:50.640]  Yeah.
[02:50.780 --> 02:54.740]  Well, I'm I'm redacting tail because I was clearly thinking of some sort of spider monkey
[02:54.740 --> 02:55.160]  or something.
[02:55.800 --> 02:57.100]  Maybe a mouth gun.
[02:58.220 --> 02:59.900]  I could could have a mouth.
[03:02.600 --> 03:04.320]  I've never seen a mouth gun.
[03:04.580 --> 03:06.460]  I'm thinking of all the guns I've seen.
[03:06.500 --> 03:07.760]  I've never seen a mouth gun.
[03:07.960 --> 03:08.480]  I'm going to show you.
[03:08.580 --> 03:10.120]  I'm going to show you a picture of this monkey.
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.460]  I just dropped a monkey pick in there.
[03:11.520 --> 03:12.820]  That's a monkey holding five guns.
[03:13.100 --> 03:14.220]  That's a five gun monkey, right?
[03:14.300 --> 03:15.240]  That's a five gun monkey.
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.560]  I think he's got a five star wanted rating.
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.200]  I think if there was a sequel to Dunstan checks in, there would have been a scene
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.340]  where Rupert Everett holds Dunstan out of a car window and he's holding four guns.
[03:26.620 --> 03:27.240]  Hell yeah.
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.700]  Dunstan checks out.
[03:28.940 --> 03:29.160]  Yeah.
[03:31.600 --> 03:34.020]  He's got to fight his way through every floor of the hotel.
[03:34.140 --> 03:35.260]  It's like the reverse raid.
[03:35.540 --> 03:36.160]  That's the radio.
[03:37.140 --> 03:38.400]  It's backwards raid.
[03:38.500 --> 03:40.500]  He's in the penthouse and he's trying to leave.
[03:41.800 --> 03:42.560]  Oh, that'd be awesome.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.520]  Have they not done a reverse raid?
[03:44.520 --> 03:45.560]  What are you doing, Dunstan?
[03:46.300 --> 03:47.440]  Check it out.
[03:48.020 --> 03:51.060]  I guess the professional is kind of the reverse raid.
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.120]  That's essentially the same last act in that movie.
[03:54.660 --> 03:57.200]  I think the maybe the rate is the reverse professional.
[04:00.120 --> 04:05.140]  Oh, it's got old Natalie Portman full circle.
[04:08.420 --> 04:08.940]  Wow.
[04:09.240 --> 04:10.360]  I'm glad we're back.
[04:10.480 --> 04:10.900]  We're back.
[04:11.020 --> 04:13.560]  Didn't expect to start the day off with monkey guns, but
[04:13.560 --> 04:14.880]  I'm glad we did.
[04:14.980 --> 04:16.900]  It's been a minute since we've recorded.
[04:17.360 --> 04:20.100]  Do we have does anybody have anything pressing that they want to go over?
[04:20.220 --> 04:24.120]  I know we've got I've got a billion notes, but a lot of them are related to other to y'all
[04:24.120 --> 04:24.600]  directly.
[04:24.860 --> 04:28.320]  Andrew assigned to me some work while I was briefly in San Francisco.
[04:29.220 --> 04:29.920]  I did.
[04:30.100 --> 04:31.220]  Oh, yeah.
[04:31.620 --> 04:33.060]  I was giving you shit for not being present.
[04:33.140 --> 04:33.940]  I don't remember this.
[04:34.080 --> 04:34.640]  What did I do?
[04:35.100 --> 04:35.780]  I'll be present.
[04:36.720 --> 04:37.520]  Oh, promotion.
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.020]  Is it promotion?
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.640]  No, no, you actually you gave me a lot of shit about a lot of things.
[04:43.560 --> 04:45.360]  One of the tasks you gave me.
[04:45.420 --> 04:45.940]  But I'm on your side.
[04:47.280 --> 04:52.180]  I flew from I flew back from England and I went to San Francisco for an event and I woke up.
[04:52.800 --> 04:56.260]  It was one of those waking ups where I don't really know where I am.
[04:56.320 --> 04:57.660]  So I'm looking around being like, what?
[04:57.860 --> 04:59.940]  What place am I figured out?
[05:00.140 --> 05:04.460]  Looked at a text from Andrew saying, hey, can you make me a grounded to thumbnail?
[05:05.240 --> 05:05.860]  Oh, yeah.
[05:05.980 --> 05:07.140]  This happens all the time.
[05:07.160 --> 05:07.580]  But continue.
[05:08.140 --> 05:11.160]  So so I made it and I don't think he appreciated it.
[05:11.280 --> 05:12.060]  Oh, I loved it.
[05:12.080 --> 05:12.900]  I thought it was fantastic.
[05:12.900 --> 05:13.640]  He didn't.
[05:13.760 --> 05:14.640]  He didn't use it or anything.
[05:15.020 --> 05:15.500]  What?
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.020]  No, we're going to use that in the future.
[05:19.340 --> 05:21.780]  Yeah, probably for this episode.
[05:22.400 --> 05:24.520]  It's amazing that this hasn't happened before.
[05:25.080 --> 05:31.040]  If I'm texting both of you things simultaneously, there are times and it hasn't gotten noticed yet
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.660]  where I am talking to one of you thinking I'm talking to the other.
[05:34.900 --> 05:36.840]  It has happened several times.
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.220]  So what you're saying is Gavin and I are essentially interchangeable, do you?
[05:41.220 --> 05:46.400]  Something about I think you guys both have the same color logo thing on my phone,
[05:46.520 --> 05:47.820]  and it's both G's.
[05:48.020 --> 05:51.180]  So there are definite times where I'll get a text and I'll go like this.
[05:51.340 --> 05:53.040]  This is an odd text from Gavin.
[05:53.140 --> 05:54.760]  And then I'll realize later, oh, it's Jeff.
[05:55.400 --> 05:56.720]  OK, or the other way.
[05:57.360 --> 06:02.440]  But yeah, I've definitely talked to you guys via text thinking I was talking to the other person.
[06:03.240 --> 06:06.520]  I so I came up with that with like one eye half shut from sleep still.
[06:06.680 --> 06:08.160]  But it's great.
[06:08.240 --> 06:10.020]  I feel like I was I was there for you just in case.
[06:10.660 --> 06:12.580]  I really appreciate it.
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.440]  That's the master.
[06:15.500 --> 06:20.380]  I feel I feel stupid for making the other thumbnail because I didn't know Gavin made this one.
[06:20.800 --> 06:21.040]  Why?
[06:21.220 --> 06:25.860]  You know, it's I figured this could be used whenever this is a classic thumbnail.
[06:26.340 --> 06:28.020]  This is timeless art.
[06:30.040 --> 06:32.620]  Maybe that's maybe that is our official.
[06:33.100 --> 06:35.100]  Like if I'm out of town and there's nobody to make the thumbnail,
[06:35.300 --> 06:37.140]  that's our placeholder thumbnail for stuff.
[06:37.180 --> 06:38.840]  That's like our technical difficulties thumbnail.
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.840]  I like it.
[06:39.980 --> 06:44.180]  Yeah, we could just write over it like it's the Da Vinci or DiCaprio canvas.
[06:44.680 --> 06:47.480]  It would be like your canvas whenever you show us a drawing and you've got like.
[06:47.800 --> 06:48.360]  Yes, exactly.
[06:48.520 --> 06:50.800]  We just keep writing over the cross out.
[06:51.720 --> 06:53.780]  Yeah, you just keep putting new things in.
[06:55.820 --> 06:56.860]  So it runs out of space.
[06:57.340 --> 06:58.420]  I like that idea.
[06:58.960 --> 07:01.040]  Pressing, though, and I don't think I have anything too pressing.
[07:01.100 --> 07:01.700]  What about you, Jeff?
[07:02.320 --> 07:05.820]  Oh, man, I got like four episodes worth of notes here.
[07:05.900 --> 07:06.780]  We've been busy.
[07:06.860 --> 07:07.900]  We could talk office.
[07:07.900 --> 07:12.660]  We could talk Sunday swims and the 500 ideas we came up with.
[07:12.740 --> 07:15.340]  We could talk pinball machines.
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.180]  We could talk flat sandwiches.
[07:17.780 --> 07:19.880]  Can can you can we talk?
[07:20.180 --> 07:21.920]  Can we talk pinball machine first?
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.100]  Because I'm so I just I'm so confused by it still.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.720]  And Nick saw it for the first time today.
[07:27.160 --> 07:29.300]  Oh, did you know it was that Nick?
[07:29.480 --> 07:29.880]  Nope.
[07:31.100 --> 07:32.500]  Scared the shit out of me.
[07:33.380 --> 07:34.680]  It's all of us.
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.680]  I think we've all been surprised differently.
[07:39.400 --> 07:44.020]  No one no one has said anything to anyone about it, which is like
[07:44.020 --> 07:48.960]  I think that says a lot for us where it's like this must be a surprise
[07:49.520 --> 07:51.540]  for an episode that I'm not.
[07:51.640 --> 07:53.000]  I don't want to be the one to spoil.
[07:53.240 --> 07:54.500]  So no one said anything.
[07:54.500 --> 07:57.140]  And it has just led to so much confusion.
[07:57.560 --> 08:01.940]  When Emily took me in to see it initially at like nine o'clock at night,
[08:01.940 --> 08:04.660]  she came up with some bullshit excuse about how she needed some tool that I
[08:04.660 --> 08:05.480]  had left at the office.
[08:05.700 --> 08:09.280]  So I had to drive her there because she was like setting up a pearl set or something.
[08:09.920 --> 08:12.600]  And and I walked in and I saw it and I looked at her and I said,
[08:12.800 --> 08:13.840]  am I supposed to see this?
[08:13.920 --> 08:14.900]  Am I supposed to know about this?
[08:14.980 --> 08:16.180]  She's like, it's for you, idiot.
[08:16.280 --> 08:17.860]  Yes, I'm taking you to see it.
[08:18.040 --> 08:19.480]  We all have the exact same reaction.
[08:19.540 --> 08:21.440]  We're like, am I supposed to be looking at this right now?
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.720]  Should I pretend like I haven't seen it?
[08:22.860 --> 08:23.460]  I said that to her.
[08:23.460 --> 08:25.780]  I was like, should I pretend like I don't I didn't see this just now?
[08:26.000 --> 08:26.640]  You looked up.
[08:26.980 --> 08:27.740]  Yeah, I locked.
[08:27.800 --> 08:28.200]  I froze.
[08:28.440 --> 08:31.420]  So you should give context as to why this pinball machine exists.
[08:32.780 --> 08:36.380]  Well, well, well, well, well.
[08:36.660 --> 08:37.380]  Gav, do you want to go?
[08:37.660 --> 08:42.220]  When we were in Vegas, we went to the pinball museum and, you know,
[08:42.280 --> 08:44.400]  I'm into pinball, but no one else really is.
[08:44.760 --> 08:47.620]  So we were walking around and then Jeff all of a sudden said,
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.140]  oh, shit, this is like one of the first ones I played when I was younger.
[08:51.440 --> 08:55.200]  And it was this pinball game I've never heard of called Earthshaker.
[08:56.420 --> 09:00.500]  And I thought it'd be really funny with Jeff's birthday coming up
[09:00.500 --> 09:05.140]  if I got him the pinball machine just without saying anything at all.
[09:05.660 --> 09:09.640]  And I was looking online and it is not a popular game.
[09:10.040 --> 09:14.220]  So it's incredibly cheap for such a giant object.
[09:14.820 --> 09:20.260]  And I love it when gifts are both wholesome and burdensome.
[09:21.640 --> 09:24.340]  Now you're stuck with this massive thing.
[09:24.540 --> 09:29.620]  And I feel like it was the perfect gift on the 20th year that I've known
[09:29.620 --> 09:30.640]  Jeff Ramsey.
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.460]  It was the most heartfelt gift to tell.
[09:34.640 --> 09:38.520]  I can't even tell you what it felt like to walk in and see it.
[09:38.660 --> 09:39.660]  This is a pinball machine.
[09:39.820 --> 09:42.780]  It's the only pinball machine that I remember from my youth.
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.380]  It was at the bowling alley where I would go when I was, you know,
[09:46.400 --> 09:47.740]  back in my bowling league days.
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.080]  And so anytime I had extra money, I would play it.
[09:50.200 --> 09:54.620]  It's basically like a dude in a convertible and a chick driving
[09:54.620 --> 09:56.260]  on the interstate in California.
[09:56.260 --> 09:59.760]  And then there's an earthquake in California and Nevada split apart
[09:59.760 --> 10:01.080]  and everything goes fucking nuts.
[10:01.240 --> 10:05.500]  It's an awesome, awesome, criminally underrated.
[10:05.720 --> 10:09.360]  I can't believe it's not in higher demand pinball machine.
[10:09.380 --> 10:11.240]  And I genuinely loved it.
[10:11.260 --> 10:15.660]  And so when I walked in, there's fucking nowhere to put it in my house.
[10:16.040 --> 10:17.240]  So obviously.
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.840]  And so I, Meg, Gavin, I think was out of town.
[10:21.940 --> 10:23.480]  So Meg had to deal with this by herself.
[10:23.480 --> 10:25.260]  So they had it delivered to the office.
[10:25.260 --> 10:28.820]  But the people would only bring it into the building.
[10:29.360 --> 10:32.880]  And so it's, you open up the front door, the front door almost hits it.
[10:33.380 --> 10:35.120]  It's like immediately in front of you.
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.900]  There was a delay with the freight shipping.
[10:37.120 --> 10:40.140]  It was going to arrive exactly a week earlier.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.840]  And then I figured I would come up with some fake reason for us
[10:42.840 --> 10:44.420]  to go to the office for no reason.
[10:45.460 --> 10:49.680]  But it ended up arriving when both Jeff and I were in different states.
[10:49.980 --> 10:53.300]  So unfortunately, Meg had to meet these dudes
[10:53.780 --> 10:56.220]  who wanted nothing to do with putting it in the house.
[10:56.380 --> 11:00.500]  They were like, oh, it's, uh, it's, uh, there's no note here
[11:00.500 --> 11:01.820]  that it's going to go up some stairs.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.920]  Because there's like, there's some stairs up to the door.
[11:04.400 --> 11:07.580]  And, um, she was like, oh, what do we do?
[11:07.640 --> 11:09.220]  And they were like, oh, we could just leave it on the road.
[11:11.840 --> 11:15.320]  Or it's, uh, $300 per step.
[11:17.040 --> 11:21.100]  Which would have made, uh, the lifting of the pinball machine
[11:21.100 --> 11:24.240]  into the room more expensive than both the pinball
[11:24.240 --> 11:25.940]  and the freight shipping combined.
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.880]  But eventually she was able to prove that I'd already mentioned
[11:32.880 --> 11:36.440]  there were stairs and I was, uh, we were able to get it in.
[11:37.020 --> 11:43.360]  But I was, I felt extremely bad that I wasn't there to help in any way.
[11:43.460 --> 11:45.980]  And then it was just in front of the front door.
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.500]  It has made it three feet from the front door.
[11:51.100 --> 11:52.960]  It is three feet from the front.
[11:53.020 --> 11:56.040]  Fucking you walk in and there's a pinball machine.
[11:56.180 --> 11:57.260]  It's the new coffee table.
[11:57.360 --> 11:58.540]  It's where the coffee table used to be.
[11:58.940 --> 12:02.200]  It seems like it seemed like the funniest place to leave it there.
[12:02.540 --> 12:03.180]  It is.
[12:03.220 --> 12:04.460]  It definitely is.
[12:05.740 --> 12:08.580]  It's getting used to Gavin came over and fixed it.
[12:08.660 --> 12:11.960]  Well, that's a brilliant soldering because one of the wires was broken.
[12:12.060 --> 12:15.320]  And this was a funny thing where the pinball machine worked flawlessly.
[12:15.880 --> 12:19.780]  But anytime you had, you got a multiball, which is, you know, kind of the point
[12:19.780 --> 12:23.020]  you had to go in under it and Eric figured out how to manually trigger it
[12:23.020 --> 12:26.500]  because that that, uh, wire had broken off.
[12:27.160 --> 12:28.860]  So you're just like shoving the plunger.
[12:29.260 --> 12:31.000]  So you would just shove the plunger to pop it out.
[12:31.100 --> 12:34.060]  But you could also very easily electrocute yourself in there
[12:34.060 --> 12:35.300]  because everything in there.
[12:35.660 --> 12:37.560]  Oh, you could close the circuit.
[12:37.760 --> 12:39.680]  Yeah, you could close the circuit pretty easy.
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.800]  I, I, I electrocuted the shit out of myself like four times playing that game.
[12:44.560 --> 12:45.700]  Gavin came and fixed it.
[12:45.740 --> 12:46.560]  No more electrocution.
[12:46.980 --> 12:49.140]  There's a feature on modern pinball games where
[12:49.140 --> 12:50.680]  when you turn the key and open the door,
[12:50.760 --> 12:53.220]  it turns off all the high voltage in the machine.
[12:53.380 --> 12:56.720]  And, uh, this pinball is from the late 80s.
[12:56.720 --> 12:57.000]  Yeah.
[12:57.920 --> 12:59.300]  Does not have that feature.
[12:59.760 --> 13:00.540]  Did not have that.
[13:00.820 --> 13:01.580]  That's wild.
[13:02.700 --> 13:04.720]  It's, it's a really fun machine.
[13:05.240 --> 13:07.800]  Like, this is like, that's like classic pinball.
[13:07.860 --> 13:08.900]  Like, it's so good.
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.180]  I really, really love it.
[13:10.820 --> 13:12.220]  We have to move it.
[13:12.340 --> 13:14.140]  It cannot keep being here.
[13:14.260 --> 13:15.180]  It can't.
[13:15.180 --> 13:20.120]  We either need to move it against the wall or to another part of the house
[13:20.700 --> 13:22.620]  because it cannot be here anymore.
[13:22.760 --> 13:24.120]  I can't.
[13:24.140 --> 13:25.520]  Completely agree, Eric.
[13:25.620 --> 13:29.860]  And once we have enough, uh, hefty boys in the building, we can move it.
[13:30.100 --> 13:31.760]  It was just been you and me lately.
[13:32.340 --> 13:33.040]  So, uh.
[13:33.040 --> 13:36.220]  Oh, dude, speak about you and me lately.
[13:36.220 --> 13:37.120]  That was yesterday.
[13:37.380 --> 13:41.580]  And we got, that's the, we busted our asses yesterday.
[13:41.720 --> 13:42.760]  That sucked.
[13:42.760 --> 13:47.980]  I say without exaggeration, yesterday was the hardest I've worked in the last year.
[13:48.000 --> 13:48.500]  Oh, my God.
[13:48.500 --> 13:48.940]  Easily.
[13:50.540 --> 13:51.140]  Easily.
[13:51.720 --> 13:52.180]  Easily.
[13:52.920 --> 13:55.100]  We went and rented a U-Haul.
[13:55.440 --> 13:56.880]  Then we drove to Eric's house.
[13:57.200 --> 14:05.800]  At Eric's house, we picked up the item that we received from the celebrity movie auction.
[14:06.140 --> 14:08.000]  When can we talk about this thing?
[14:08.560 --> 14:09.880]  When can we, when can we?
[14:09.880 --> 14:10.640]  Why are we?
[14:10.740 --> 14:11.280]  Who's tell?
[14:11.420 --> 14:13.880]  Why are we not letting us talk about something that we bought?
[14:14.120 --> 14:15.140]  I just ask Andrew.
[14:15.920 --> 14:17.920]  No, we can talk about it.
[14:17.940 --> 14:18.920]  I'm going to talk about it.
[14:18.920 --> 14:21.340]  I didn't know if we wanted to do like a bigger reveal for it.
[14:21.360 --> 14:23.360]  I don't know if we had a video idea, but things have been crazy.
[14:23.500 --> 14:24.880]  People have been gone for weeks.
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.340]  It has not been easy to schedule things, but I have no issue talking about it.
[14:28.400 --> 14:31.260]  It just hasn't been ideal to like make something with it yet.
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.160]  It would be cool to do it as a reveal, but I don't have any ideas for reveals.
[14:36.300 --> 14:36.920]  Anybody else?
[14:37.560 --> 14:38.420]  I had an idea.
[14:38.420 --> 14:39.700]  I had an idea.
[14:39.920 --> 14:42.900]  It made more sense at our anniversary when it was.
[14:43.020 --> 14:45.440]  There is a time in which we thought maybe it would get there.
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.240]  But oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:48.360 --> 14:49.300]  No, I have an idea.
[14:49.700 --> 14:54.480]  OK, so let's keep it vague for now that I was a fan of this podcast.
[14:54.560 --> 14:56.880]  I would be so fucking mad at us.
[14:57.260 --> 14:58.340]  We got this item.
[14:58.480 --> 15:03.080]  We got this item from the movie, kind of like we got the the snake eyes costume and the
[15:03.080 --> 15:04.380]  tuxedo jacket and tuxedo.
[15:04.860 --> 15:06.120]  It's kind of the evolution.
[15:06.120 --> 15:13.140]  The next the next thing in our in our I guess our grand museum of oddities, and it's awesome,
[15:13.200 --> 15:15.840]  but it's big and bulky and heavy.
[15:15.920 --> 15:20.540]  And so Eric and I rented a 15 foot U-Haul super mover, as they say.
[15:20.620 --> 15:21.340]  Thought it was overkill.
[15:21.860 --> 15:24.760]  Absolutely was not overkill because we 100% filled that thing up.
[15:25.180 --> 15:30.620]  Anyway, we go to his house and we pick up the the item and I say pick up.
[15:30.680 --> 15:34.120]  I mean, we bust our asses to get that thing into the holiday because it's fucking heavy.
[15:34.120 --> 15:36.180]  We took the item apart.
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.620]  Well, eventually we had to take it apart, but we got it into the U-Haul fully formed
[15:41.140 --> 15:44.260]  and and then like some old shit that Eric had that he wanted to throw away to
[15:45.040 --> 15:46.240]  just because we were in his garage.
[15:46.420 --> 15:50.480]  And then we came back to the office and we wanted to put it in
[15:51.920 --> 15:54.680]  into the room that's full of cardboard.
[15:54.840 --> 15:58.240]  We have a room in the building that is full of cardboard.
[15:58.540 --> 16:03.640]  Imagine every piece of cardboard a company goes through when they build out a location
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.720]  and they buy every single item from scratch.
[16:07.940 --> 16:13.080]  We had so much cardboard thrown and stacked into the room that it reached the ceiling.
[16:13.260 --> 16:13.400]  Right.
[16:13.520 --> 16:16.340]  And that happens to be the only room that we can put this item in.
[16:16.360 --> 16:20.420]  So Eric and I pulled all of the cardboard out, put it like in the driveway.
[16:21.660 --> 16:27.200]  Then we wrench this thing out of the U-Haul and try to slam it in through the door.
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.220]  And no matter how we bend and push it and twist it, we cannot get it through the door.
[16:32.220 --> 16:34.580]  There's no way to get it through the door.
[16:34.680 --> 16:37.100]  So we had to disassemble it,
[16:37.820 --> 16:43.020]  which was scary because we were afraid we were breaking something from a film.
[16:43.420 --> 16:44.100]  You know, sure.
[16:44.280 --> 16:45.940]  Wasn't weren't jazzed about doing that.
[16:45.980 --> 16:49.460]  And also, Eric and I aren't the handiest dudes on earth either.
[16:49.780 --> 16:54.200]  And but we got the thing taken apart, eventually got it into the building,
[16:54.520 --> 16:57.520]  rebuilt it, got it set up, and it's working.
[16:57.520 --> 17:02.820]  So so just real quick, we're not the handiest guys in the world.
[17:02.940 --> 17:03.480]  It's true.
[17:03.900 --> 17:10.720]  You need to see what it is, how this thing is built and what it is exactly to realize
[17:10.720 --> 17:14.420]  that it doesn't fucking matter that we're not the handiest guys in the world
[17:14.420 --> 17:18.880]  because it is held together with screws and wishes.
[17:19.140 --> 17:25.940]  Yeah, it's definitely it was definitely built to be used once and thrown away for sure.
[17:27.800 --> 17:30.020]  But unfortunately for it, we're the trash can.
[17:31.980 --> 17:35.320]  So anyway, at this point, I'll be honest, I'm about done.
[17:35.560 --> 17:36.840]  Like I'm fucking exhausted.
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.120]  Just getting that thing in the in the building felt like a full day of work.
[17:41.280 --> 17:42.640]  And we just had.
[17:45.300 --> 17:48.840]  Mount Kilimanjaro of cardboard in the driveway.
[17:49.140 --> 17:51.600]  And so then we took all of the cardboard.
[17:53.140 --> 17:59.660]  And styrofoam and every piece of discarded whatever from building out the office,
[17:59.660 --> 18:02.260]  and we threw it in the back of this 15 foot.
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.940]  U-Haul, it reached the ceiling in the U-Haul.
[18:08.080 --> 18:08.780]  Eric took a photo.
[18:08.960 --> 18:12.600]  He can upload that maybe into the discord chat so you can see it.
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.320]  And I will say this is after we had started unloading.
[18:17.480 --> 18:19.600]  We didn't think to take a photo when it was fully full.
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.800]  So it's it's maybe 10 minutes into the unload at this point of like maybe
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.320]  it took about 40 minutes to unload it.
[18:26.480 --> 18:33.660]  Anyway, we fill we fill the thing up and it goes 15 feet back.
[18:33.820 --> 18:35.080]  There's so much cardboard.
[18:35.960 --> 18:36.760]  So bad.
[18:37.220 --> 18:40.400]  This and this is after we've we've cleared out a good portion of it.
[18:40.500 --> 18:44.160]  We drive across town to this recycling place that I found online
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.900]  that I was able to make an appointment at.
[18:45.900 --> 18:49.940]  And then we just very slowly took out every piece of cardboard
[18:49.940 --> 18:55.080]  and gave it to some dude who just looked at us like he fucking hated us.
[18:55.440 --> 18:57.100]  And then he stuck it in a machine.
[18:57.300 --> 19:00.780]  I tried to joke around with Jeff was trying to make small.
[19:00.800 --> 19:02.420]  Oh, no, small time with a guy.
[19:02.540 --> 19:04.360]  He never acknowledged me.
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.760]  He just looked me dead in the eyes and just absorbed anything I said to him like he like
[19:09.760 --> 19:10.700]  it bounced off of him.
[19:10.820 --> 19:15.600]  And it was it was humbling.
[19:16.040 --> 19:20.240]  But anyway, and we were there for probably 45 minutes, just separating the different
[19:20.240 --> 19:23.960]  kinds of recycling and giving it to the people so that they could destroy it or move it by
[19:23.960 --> 19:24.520]  the time.
[19:24.720 --> 19:27.020]  And then we had to go back and return to the U-Haul.
[19:27.220 --> 19:34.120]  And I think that took us about five hours of just in 100 degrees, just straight fucking
[19:34.120 --> 19:35.300]  lifting and shoving.
[19:35.420 --> 19:39.120]  And you'd be amazed how heavy cardboard gets after a couple hours.
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.800]  I'm going to guess that at no point did you close the shutter of the U-Haul with someone
[19:43.800 --> 19:45.460]  inside and then just like do doughnuts.
[19:46.680 --> 19:53.220]  I know, but we almost left without closing it at all, which would have been I mean, I
[19:53.220 --> 19:55.020]  think we definitely could have done that, Gavin.
[19:55.140 --> 20:00.180]  I mean, the U-Haul had a third seat and we were texting someone to see if they wanted
[20:00.180 --> 20:03.500]  to come and help and play, but they didn't want to.
[20:03.600 --> 20:05.040]  So it was just me and Jeff all day.
[20:05.920 --> 20:11.000]  I by the time I was free, I texted to the group.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.220]  Well, just you two as a group.
[20:12.820 --> 20:14.140]  Uh, hey, I'm free.
[20:14.240 --> 20:14.860]  Are you guys done?
[20:14.980 --> 20:16.380]  And you just went, yep.
[20:19.460 --> 20:20.460]  We're pretty good.
[20:20.680 --> 20:26.840]  Because the amount of manual labor that we did was like, it was so fucked.
[20:27.080 --> 20:29.580]  Just putting cardboard in that thing.
[20:29.640 --> 20:32.460]  And then it all kept falling towards like further to like the back.
[20:32.620 --> 20:34.880]  So one of us would have to get in and move it.
[20:35.160 --> 20:36.740]  Climb to the top of Cardinal Mountain.
[20:37.260 --> 20:37.700]  To the front.
[20:37.820 --> 20:41.160]  And then we get there and unloading it and sorting it and doing it.
[20:41.160 --> 20:48.080]  And then here's the problem with me and Jeff is that the initial idea was, okay, we're
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.220]  going to, we're going to take all this cardboard.
[20:49.380 --> 20:51.820]  We're just going to go to a bunch of dumpsters and we're just going to put a bunch of dumpsters
[20:51.820 --> 20:53.120]  and no one will know and it'll be fine.
[20:53.160 --> 20:54.480]  And we'll just find a bunch of dumpsters.
[20:54.800 --> 20:59.140]  And then Jeff was like, oh, I found a, I found like a recycling center that will just simply
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.040]  take all the cardboard.
[21:00.480 --> 21:05.860]  We were so proud of ourselves for doing it the right way that we kept talking about it.
[21:05.960 --> 21:10.980]  We talked about it for 10 minutes afterwards about how nice it was to do it the right way.
[21:11.780 --> 21:15.780]  I've never congratulated myself and someone else so much in my life.
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.880]  We were so proud of ourselves for doing it the right way and saving ourselves so many
[21:21.880 --> 21:27.200]  hours of dumpster tossing and hiding behind buildings and you know what I mean?
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.820]  Because that's that was totally where it was headed.
[21:29.920 --> 21:33.420]  But then once we saw how much cardboard it was, we were like, there's just no way.
[21:33.940 --> 21:36.560]  It's just no way this can't be a stealth mission.
[21:37.140 --> 21:37.920]  It's impossible.
[21:38.380 --> 21:38.620]  Yeah.
[21:38.620 --> 21:41.440]  Imagine if you found Halo Wars, your dumpster diving.
[21:44.120 --> 21:46.980]  I assumed it wasn't fun because of the heat.
[21:47.140 --> 21:48.960]  But I love days like that.
[21:49.020 --> 21:52.440]  Like the day we just got a U-Haul and like we're doing the port-a-potty and like moving
[21:52.440 --> 21:53.740]  stuff all around out of the office.
[21:54.280 --> 21:56.340]  Oh, you would have loved yesterday, dude.
[21:56.420 --> 21:57.340]  We had so much fun.
[21:57.580 --> 21:58.460]  It sucks so bad.
[21:58.640 --> 22:03.820]  But we also spent a lot of time congratulating ourselves on all the heavy lifting that we
[22:03.820 --> 22:06.920]  did and all the like thankless grunt work we were doing.
[22:07.380 --> 22:09.720]  Eric and I were pretty high on Eric and I yesterday.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.060]  No one was bigger fans of us than us yesterday, man.
[22:13.100 --> 22:13.660]  It was great.
[22:14.140 --> 22:15.320]  But we got that room.
[22:15.420 --> 22:16.640]  We got that room cleared out.
[22:16.740 --> 22:17.760]  Looks good in the house, man.
[22:18.160 --> 22:20.820]  You've both had like manual labor jobs there, right?
[22:20.880 --> 22:21.240]  In the past.
[22:21.520 --> 22:22.200]  Yeah, of course.
[22:22.480 --> 22:24.340]  Yeah, a long time ago.
[22:24.900 --> 22:25.400]  Oh, I see.
[22:25.680 --> 22:29.080]  Just like, yeah, I'm like, I'm like almost 40.
[22:29.140 --> 22:31.240]  I haven't had a job like that since I was like in my 20s.
[22:31.520 --> 22:36.460]  I know I may project a timeless youth, but I am a half a century old.
[22:36.460 --> 22:40.720]  I am older than all of your parents at this point listening to this podcast.
[22:41.300 --> 22:43.820]  So the pinball movers were $300 per step.
[22:43.840 --> 22:45.820]  What would your guys fee be for per step?
[22:47.540 --> 22:49.200]  Oh, man, incalculable.
[22:49.700 --> 22:51.880]  Yeah, we went up and down a lot of steps.
[22:52.060 --> 22:54.200]  I imagine there were a lot of there are a lot of steps.
[22:54.440 --> 22:58.640]  You don't you know, they just add up and then climbing in and out of that U-Haul that adds
[22:58.640 --> 23:02.500]  up and having to climb in and out of the U-Haul again to get all the stuff out.
[23:02.980 --> 23:08.600]  Imagine a room so full of cardboard that just the act of removing the cardboard from
[23:08.600 --> 23:11.120]  that room takes 30 full minutes.
[23:11.600 --> 23:13.640]  I've never seen so much cardboard in my life.
[23:13.760 --> 23:15.880]  And we didn't buy that much shit, did we?
[23:16.020 --> 23:16.860]  I guess we did.
[23:17.040 --> 23:17.680]  We did.
[23:17.860 --> 23:18.560]  We did.
[23:18.800 --> 23:21.640]  The problem was like a lot of it was broken down, too.
[23:21.700 --> 23:22.280]  Thanks to Emily.
[23:22.340 --> 23:23.140]  She did a great job.
[23:23.960 --> 23:25.080]  It was broken down.
[23:25.180 --> 23:25.660]  It was great.
[23:25.760 --> 23:26.660]  A lot of it wasn't.
[23:26.700 --> 23:31.280]  It took us half an hour to move half of it out of the room so we could get the huge auction
[23:31.280 --> 23:34.820]  item in which took another half hour to disassemble and reassemble.
[23:35.600 --> 23:40.380]  And then we had to put all of the cardboard that was in the driveway in the truck and then
[23:40.380 --> 23:42.520]  had to get the other half of the cardboard out of the house.
[23:42.660 --> 23:45.400]  It was like, dude, it felt endless.
[23:45.580 --> 23:50.260]  And when you walked in, when you every time you walked in from outside, you would just
[23:50.260 --> 23:51.400]  go, we got to be getting close.
[23:51.520 --> 23:52.040]  You're not.
[23:52.260 --> 23:53.780]  It's it's just a fission.
[23:53.960 --> 23:55.160]  It was so bad.
[23:55.160 --> 23:56.020]  It sucked.
[24:02.010 --> 24:05.930]  Remember that doctor's appointment that when you planned on booking, but then life got
[24:05.930 --> 24:09.610]  in the way or that dental appointment, you keep needing to rebook since you canceled
[24:09.610 --> 24:10.130]  it before.
[24:10.570 --> 24:11.590]  Why not book it today?
[24:12.090 --> 24:16.290]  Zocdoc makes it easy to find the right doctor right now, and it's all online.
[24:16.470 --> 24:18.790]  You probably could have it booked before this ad ends.
[24:19.170 --> 24:22.570]  I don't know about you guys, but my social feed is filled with different health trends.
[24:22.570 --> 24:29.030]  Stuff like cottage cheese is an entire nutrition plan or red light therapy can solve every
[24:29.030 --> 24:29.770]  skin problem.
[24:30.230 --> 24:32.510]  I say we give these questionable trends a rest.
[24:32.790 --> 24:37.370]  Turn to IRL health care professionals who can help you meet your health goals.
[24:37.890 --> 24:39.470]  And with Zocdoc, it's easy.
[24:39.770 --> 24:43.270]  You can find doctors that are right for you and instantly book an appointment.

[24:48.050 --> 24:50.890]  doctors and click to instantly book an appointment.

[24:55.690 --> 24:56.230]  specialty.
[24:56.710 --> 24:58.530]  With a range like that, you know you'll be covered.
[24:58.890 --> 25:03.410]  We're talking from mental health to dental health, primary care to urgent care and more.
[25:03.750 --> 25:04.810]  The range is incredible.
[25:05.370 --> 25:09.270]  You can filter for doctors who take your insurance, are located nearby, are a good
[25:09.270 --> 25:13.310]  fit for any medical need you may have, and are highly rated by verified patients.
[25:13.630 --> 25:18.230]  Once you find the right doctor, you can see their actual appointment openings, choose
[25:18.230 --> 25:21.350]  a time slot that works for you, and click to instantly book a visit.
[25:21.690 --> 25:25.190]  With easy filtering, you won't have to worry about finding the specifications you need.
[25:25.530 --> 25:27.710]  And with Zocdoc appointments, they happen fast.
[25:28.050 --> 25:29.430]  The last thing you want is a long wait.

[25:35.090 --> 25:36.010]  which is so important.
[25:36.430 --> 25:38.430]  If this was something I needed, I'd use Zocdoc.
[25:38.830 --> 25:44.230]  Stop putting off those doctor's appointments and go to zocdoc.com slash regulation to find
[25:44.230 --> 25:46.150]  and instantly book a top-rated doctor today.

[25:57.870 --> 26:04.570]  Introducing the new Volvo XC90, with seven-seat versatility, Google built-in, and advanced
[26:04.570 --> 26:06.770]  safety features for all your precious cargo.
[26:07.070 --> 26:10.010]  The new Volvo XC90, designed for life.
[26:10.230 --> 26:12.550]  Visit volvocars.com slash us to learn more.
[26:13.130 --> 26:16.810]  Anyway, the office is fucking humming along, though.
[26:16.850 --> 26:18.370]  We got our trash can built.
[26:18.510 --> 26:21.170]  I got curtains hung in the break room.
[26:21.330 --> 26:23.110]  We ran the video and everything.
[26:23.110 --> 26:25.830]  All the tech for the break room.
[26:25.930 --> 26:28.930]  We're just waiting on doing the sound with Nick now that he's back.
[26:29.230 --> 26:32.390]  We'll be ready to go on that show in probably two weeks from this recording.
[26:33.070 --> 26:36.730]  I don't know that we'll release it in two weeks, but we're just, we're like, I would
[26:36.730 --> 26:39.970]  say this Death Star is like 94% operational.
[26:40.650 --> 26:42.030]  We're the Death Star?
[26:42.830 --> 26:43.710]  Yeah, why not?
[26:44.710 --> 26:46.970]  Maybe because I'd like to be the good guys.
[26:47.170 --> 26:49.910]  We point our laser beam of comedy at the universe.
[26:50.530 --> 26:53.250]  Take that, Alderaan, aka the listeners.
[26:53.730 --> 26:58.790]  Alderaan was just a metaphor for misery, and by shooting it with our comedy Death Star
[26:58.790 --> 27:00.550]  array, we're blowing up their sadness.
[27:01.030 --> 27:03.190]  So where's our weakness hole in the office?
[27:03.230 --> 27:04.290]  That's what I was about to say.
[27:04.410 --> 27:08.330]  Imagine if there was a weakness hole in the pinball machine, like a really hard spot,
[27:08.450 --> 27:11.890]  but if the ball went into a certain area, the whole office just collapses.
[27:12.470 --> 27:15.230]  I think it's where it kept electrocuting me when I was trying to play.
[27:16.890 --> 27:20.330]  For a guy that hates pinball, Eric, you've played quite a lot of this one.
[27:20.430 --> 27:22.490]  I love free play.
[27:22.750 --> 27:24.630]  I love free play pinball.
[27:25.130 --> 27:33.010]  If I had to pay for the pinball that I played today before we started this, oh baby, oh
[27:33.010 --> 27:37.390]  baby, I would have been furious and slamming the machine to get my money back.
[27:38.630 --> 27:39.330]  Yeah, that's fair.
[27:39.950 --> 27:42.870]  There are plenty of things I enjoy when I don't have to pay for them.
[27:43.890 --> 27:44.910]  Live music, like what?
[27:45.330 --> 27:46.190]  Live music is one.
[27:46.930 --> 27:51.730]  I have zero interest in paying for a ticket to a concert, but when I hear live music,
[27:51.990 --> 27:56.410]  I'm always like, huh, I feel like if I hear live music I didn't pay for, it annoys me.
[27:56.830 --> 27:59.790]  No, I love some live music I didn't pay for.
[27:59.950 --> 28:00.670]  It's free.
[28:00.830 --> 28:02.250]  It's free music in this economy.
[28:02.530 --> 28:06.510]  I'll take any savings I could get, but it's not going to be someone you're interested in.
[28:06.590 --> 28:07.750]  Surely that's not true.
[28:08.430 --> 28:14.210]  I've I've encountered many of unexpected live performances that I've enjoyed.
[28:14.390 --> 28:15.210]  In Nanaimo?
[28:15.770 --> 28:16.030]  Yeah.
[28:16.950 --> 28:17.850]  No, in Austin.
[28:18.150 --> 28:19.190]  Where do you, what do you?
[28:19.950 --> 28:20.870]  Well, I just didn't.
[28:20.990 --> 28:24.010]  Do people come over and do performances in that town?
[28:24.490 --> 28:26.650]  Well, you can do, you know, there are public spaces.
[28:26.790 --> 28:28.330]  It's a music free environment.
[28:28.530 --> 28:28.730]  You can go.
[28:28.890 --> 28:30.750]  Yeah, we're working on.
[28:30.810 --> 28:31.410]  It's illegal.
[28:31.530 --> 28:32.170]  It's like Footloose.
[28:32.330 --> 28:33.410]  There's no dancing, no music.
[28:33.490 --> 28:36.230]  Yeah, we had the Footloose rules up until like 2018.
[28:36.230 --> 28:38.490]  So it's become real musical since then.
[28:38.710 --> 28:39.770]  People would go crazy.
[28:39.950 --> 28:43.530]  Because to be honest, when I was snooping around Nanaimo to try and pick a building
[28:43.530 --> 28:48.090]  that you had to identify on Google Maps, I didn't really see a lot of good venues.
[28:48.770 --> 28:52.790]  Well, when I say venue, well, we do have one great venue downtown.
[28:53.010 --> 28:58.850]  There are a few like decent venues, but I'm talking about on the streets, people playing music.
[28:58.890 --> 28:59.630]  OK, that's fair.
[28:59.670 --> 29:00.450]  Like public spaces.
[29:00.790 --> 29:01.450]  Busker style.
[29:02.010 --> 29:06.610]  Some busker style, but also there's like a jazz festival and like a rock like music
[29:06.610 --> 29:11.050]  festivals that occur throughout the summer where people will just play and sort of
[29:12.130 --> 29:18.210]  hubs that people visit, like the downtown core or just various places where you can
[29:18.210 --> 29:20.510]  just hear people playing music if you're in the area.
[29:20.790 --> 29:21.770]  It's always nice.
[29:22.070 --> 29:24.030]  I enjoy some unexpected live music.
[29:24.470 --> 29:25.810]  What else do you like that's better when it's free?
[29:26.610 --> 29:28.610]  What's better when it's free?
[29:28.690 --> 29:30.850]  I mean, most things are better when it's free.
[29:31.450 --> 29:34.210]  But like that, I dislike when I'm paying for it.
[29:35.410 --> 29:35.890]  Hmm.
[29:37.690 --> 29:39.990]  I think most food gets elevated.
[29:40.650 --> 29:46.590]  There's food I don't like that if given to me for free, I think would become it elevates
[29:46.590 --> 29:49.670]  not to a point in which I'd like it, but it would be edible.
[29:51.590 --> 29:54.130]  What's what's something you hear?
[29:54.670 --> 29:55.150]  Insane.
[29:55.270 --> 29:55.890]  No, here's the thing.
[29:56.010 --> 29:59.990]  What's something I would be so fucking mad if I had a list of stuff I still don't like
[29:59.990 --> 30:00.790]  if it's free.
[30:01.210 --> 30:02.510]  I'm right there with Andrew.
[30:02.710 --> 30:05.910]  I just did a thing on Saul Wright about like discontinued sodas.
[30:05.970 --> 30:10.330]  And I told a story about how there was this soda called Josta in the 90s that they were
[30:10.330 --> 30:13.050]  giving away when I was living in South Carolina.
[30:13.070 --> 30:16.670]  And we my friends and I got like 40 of them because they were free and we drank it all
[30:16.670 --> 30:16.850]  summer.
[30:16.930 --> 30:19.790]  It was the grossest thing ever, and I would never have paid 30 cents for it.
[30:19.810 --> 30:21.910]  But for free, I drank it all day long.
[30:22.290 --> 30:23.610]  Yeah, for me, it's cauliflower.
[30:24.190 --> 30:28.130]  If someone forced me to pay for cauliflower, I'd be fucking furious.
[30:28.230 --> 30:29.090]  I'd be so upset.
[30:29.090 --> 30:34.730]  But if I'm at like a dinner and someone's like, oh, I made this cauliflower dish.
[30:34.950 --> 30:35.710]  I can eat.
[30:35.810 --> 30:36.830]  I'll be like, yeah, this is edible.
[30:37.410 --> 30:43.210]  So if you had the choice between a five dollar meal of something you enjoy and a free cauliflower,
[30:43.870 --> 30:44.850]  you would go for that.
[30:47.110 --> 30:47.910]  Oh, what?
[30:48.750 --> 30:53.170]  See, it becomes a it becomes a dilemma of value because like, what's the meal?
[30:53.810 --> 30:55.310]  Oh, what's the five dollar meal?
[30:55.650 --> 30:55.770]  Yeah.
[30:55.790 --> 30:56.310]  What do you like?
[30:56.450 --> 30:57.050]  What's it?
[30:57.050 --> 30:57.790]  It's a chicken.
[30:57.930 --> 30:58.710]  It's a chicken meal.
[30:59.290 --> 31:00.770]  Oh, that sounds pretty good.
[31:00.830 --> 31:03.570]  Five dollars for a chicken meal in this economy.
[31:03.830 --> 31:05.170]  It's a chicken sandwich.
[31:05.630 --> 31:08.070]  Oh, I'm taking the chicken sandwich.
[31:08.530 --> 31:13.350]  I've never heard Andrew say in this economy before, and he said it like four times.
[31:13.350 --> 31:15.610]  And we're living in this economy, Eric.
[31:16.330 --> 31:18.510]  The chicken prices are crazy.
[31:19.170 --> 31:21.850]  When's the last time you paid five bucks for a chicken sandwich?
[31:22.630 --> 31:23.670]  Oh, my God.
[31:23.730 --> 31:26.750]  That's like a nine dollar sandwich at any fast food restaurant you go to today.
[31:26.750 --> 31:29.770]  You can't even get half a foot long for five dollars.
[31:30.090 --> 31:31.310]  You find five dollars anything.
[31:31.470 --> 31:31.930]  I'm buying it.
[31:32.450 --> 31:32.670]  Yeah.
[31:32.850 --> 31:35.050]  Oh, speaking of footlong.
[31:36.590 --> 31:42.510]  Me and Jeff and Gavin had a lot of we had a lot of fun on.
[31:42.750 --> 31:43.050]  What was it?
[31:43.130 --> 31:44.950]  It was a Monday, Tuesday, maybe.
[31:45.250 --> 31:46.030]  Yeah, it was.
[31:46.170 --> 31:46.790]  Yeah, we did it.
[31:46.870 --> 31:47.870]  Yeah, we had a pretty good.
[31:47.930 --> 31:50.390]  We had a pretty good time with a with a couple of sandwiches.
[31:51.010 --> 31:54.550]  So Eric or I, I can't remember who found that initially over the weekend.
[31:54.550 --> 32:00.130]  Saw a tick tock of some dude who had a subway sandwich and fell on it like he tripped and fell.
[32:00.430 --> 32:02.770]  And he was just you don't see him fall.
[32:02.850 --> 32:04.010]  You just see the aftermath.
[32:04.290 --> 32:09.330]  He opens it up and it's a perfectly flat like sandwich, like a like a cartoon steamroller
[32:09.330 --> 32:10.050]  drove over it.
[32:10.150 --> 32:13.610]  It's impossibly flat for a sub sandwich under a centimeter.
[32:13.650 --> 32:15.070]  And so, yeah, under a centimeter.
[32:15.070 --> 32:15.490]  There you go.
[32:15.590 --> 32:19.750]  So when we were hanging out Sunday, having a boat day, we got to talking about it and
[32:19.750 --> 32:24.810]  we decided to have a contest to see who could flatten a sandwich the most.
[32:25.490 --> 32:30.070]  And so we got together on Tuesday and we all we went and we all got the same.
[32:30.230 --> 32:33.150]  I almost said we all rented the same sandwich.
[32:33.250 --> 32:35.390]  We all went and we bought the same.
[32:35.390 --> 32:37.270]  And this economy, that's what we got to do.
[32:37.890 --> 32:39.570]  We should have returned those subway sandwiches.
[32:39.570 --> 32:42.110]  I guess I had I guess I had U-Haul in the brain still.
[32:42.250 --> 32:43.330]  Well, they were very close to each other.
[32:43.390 --> 32:44.170]  The U-Haul on the subway.
[32:44.630 --> 32:45.470]  They're on the same street.
[32:45.470 --> 32:51.970]  And and we bought we bought three identical sub sandwiches and then we filmed the video
[32:51.970 --> 32:54.090]  to see who could flatten it the most.
[32:54.190 --> 32:56.070]  And there was a clear winner.
[32:56.430 --> 32:57.650]  But obviously, we can't spoil it.
[32:57.910 --> 32:59.070]  Yeah, we'll have that video.
[32:59.450 --> 33:00.910]  I think the video might be out right now.
[33:00.990 --> 33:01.130]  Yeah.
[33:01.150 --> 33:02.250]  Can we just stick it up?
[33:02.730 --> 33:02.930]  Yeah.
[33:03.270 --> 33:03.650]  Yeah.
[33:03.730 --> 33:03.890]  Yeah.
[33:03.890 --> 33:06.250]  We'll put it out tomorrow if someone decides to edit it.
[33:06.830 --> 33:07.590]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[33:07.910 --> 33:09.190]  I have an idea for it.
[33:09.550 --> 33:10.350]  Decides to edit.
[33:11.630 --> 33:12.490]  I don't know.
[33:12.530 --> 33:13.410]  It's supposed to go out tomorrow.
[33:14.050 --> 33:14.790]  It's supposed to.
[33:14.790 --> 33:16.170]  Is that what we agreed on already?
[33:18.030 --> 33:18.430]  Yes.
[33:18.550 --> 33:21.250]  I mean, this is 30 seconds ago from you.
[33:21.370 --> 33:22.590]  This is from you.
[33:22.710 --> 33:24.650]  No, I put it on the calendar for you.
[33:25.330 --> 33:27.190]  No, dipshit, you.
[33:29.870 --> 33:32.850]  We had this conversation in the office.
[33:33.210 --> 33:37.230]  Yeah, but you said you would like look at the calendar and you'll see when we can stick
[33:37.230 --> 33:37.530]  it out.
[33:37.630 --> 33:38.970]  You said that I was still waiting.
[33:39.150 --> 33:41.350]  We all stood around my computer.
[33:41.350 --> 33:45.590]  We all stood around my computer and I put it on the calendar and I said, can you edit
[33:45.590 --> 33:46.750]  it by this day and time?
[33:47.150 --> 33:48.670]  That's not maybe I was playing pinball.
[33:48.750 --> 33:49.530]  I don't remember that at all.
[33:49.830 --> 33:52.590]  And then you said you said maybe we can show it on the stream.
[33:53.510 --> 33:55.790]  Yeah, these are all maybes.
[33:56.070 --> 33:59.110]  So are we settling on just putting it up or is it going on the stream?
[33:59.170 --> 34:01.110]  This is so nuts.
[34:01.270 --> 34:02.730]  I don't care if we put it up or not.
[34:02.790 --> 34:03.970]  This is so crazy.
[34:04.210 --> 34:07.830]  This is like the most we like thing in the world.
[34:08.030 --> 34:10.030]  I did all of the lifting on my end.
[34:10.030 --> 34:11.730]  I don't know what else I'm supposed to do.
[34:11.730 --> 34:12.990]  Well, just finalize it.
[34:13.190 --> 34:14.890]  Jeff, do you agree that we talk about it?
[34:15.130 --> 34:19.590]  I hate I hate to step in, but I was there.
[34:19.650 --> 34:20.610]  I'm independent.
[34:21.010 --> 34:25.130]  I can dispassionately evaluate the situation.
[34:25.130 --> 34:29.450]  And I hate to say this, Gavin, but Eric's being very accurate with the way it went down.
[34:29.690 --> 34:32.450]  We all scheduled it on the calendar together.
[34:32.610 --> 34:37.730]  You were probably playing pinball, but it was put on the calendar and decided there
[34:37.730 --> 34:40.350]  was a discussion over which Friday and what video to bump.
[34:40.450 --> 34:41.130]  It was a whole thing.
[34:41.590 --> 34:46.230]  And then in addition to that, you said maybe we could also show it on the stream.
[34:46.410 --> 34:47.830]  And he went and Eric was like, yeah, that's great.
[34:47.870 --> 34:48.510]  We could do that, too.
[34:48.870 --> 34:53.890]  But I was I'm pretty sure like I definitely left the office thinking it was scheduled.
[34:54.290 --> 34:54.610]  All right.
[34:54.650 --> 34:57.030]  Well, you know, that that pinball machine is a real menace.
[34:57.230 --> 34:59.310]  And I shouldn't be in front of the front door.
[34:59.350 --> 35:02.390]  I take it back.
[35:02.410 --> 35:02.850]  I'm sorry.
[35:02.930 --> 35:03.570]  Eric's wrong.
[35:03.990 --> 35:04.490]  Gavin's right.
[35:04.530 --> 35:06.490]  Maybe you got electrocuted and you forgot.
[35:06.490 --> 35:09.210]  Maybe it shocked you and like a brainwave thing.
[35:10.650 --> 35:11.310]  Who knows?
[35:11.490 --> 35:13.550]  Screw Eric, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[35:13.770 --> 35:17.450]  My my question, because I didn't want to overload you because I like you have other
[35:17.450 --> 35:18.090]  stuff all the time.
[35:18.170 --> 35:20.090]  I never want to overload you with like an edit or whatever.
[35:20.090 --> 35:21.770]  And I went, are you sure you can do that?
[35:21.890 --> 35:23.490]  Like by Friday, that's going to be OK.
[35:23.490 --> 35:24.570]  And you assured me.
[35:24.670 --> 35:25.590]  Yeah, no problem.
[35:25.670 --> 35:28.070]  Well, here's the thing when I finish, because there's no audio to sync.
[35:28.210 --> 35:29.790]  It's all just on your phone.
[35:30.310 --> 35:35.610]  When I when I finished up yesterday with my work and the two people, the two people I
[35:35.610 --> 35:37.750]  was going to help were already finished with their work.
[35:38.090 --> 35:40.890]  Turns out I had a little bit extra time to get that that video done.
[35:40.950 --> 35:41.430]  So it's ready.
[35:42.170 --> 35:43.050]  Oh, that's great.
[35:43.730 --> 35:45.110]  So you did it on time.
[35:45.610 --> 35:45.790]  Yeah.
[35:45.830 --> 35:46.790]  So what's the issue?
[35:47.010 --> 35:49.890]  So you did it on time, but you didn't realize you were doing it on time.
[35:50.010 --> 35:52.950]  And so now you're being persnickety about whether it's on time or not.
[35:54.030 --> 35:57.650]  I knew it was going to I knew we're going to try and put it out, like just drop it on
[35:57.650 --> 36:00.130]  top of like either bump something or just put it out in addition.
[36:00.490 --> 36:03.250]  But I just didn't know whether it was going to be like Friday or Saturday or whatever.
[36:03.770 --> 36:04.430]  Just got it done anyway.
[36:04.430 --> 36:05.610]  That video might not be done.
[36:05.790 --> 36:06.830]  I'm just throwing that out there.
[36:07.130 --> 36:08.630]  I have a thing to talk about later.
[36:09.030 --> 36:09.170]  Yeah.
[36:09.230 --> 36:10.090]  What does that mean?
[36:10.310 --> 36:11.810]  Oh, is there an I can add to it.
[36:12.050 --> 36:13.630]  I think there's going to be an addition potentially.
[36:14.510 --> 36:15.610]  Oh, oh, wow.
[36:15.750 --> 36:17.490]  And so this isn't going to come out tomorrow.
[36:17.490 --> 36:20.330]  But when you're listening to this podcast, maybe it'll come out that Friday.
[36:20.530 --> 36:21.050]  I don't know.
[36:21.590 --> 36:22.370]  I have no idea.
[36:22.990 --> 36:25.290]  Do you do you want your your attempt in the video?
[36:26.750 --> 36:27.850]  That's not what I was thinking.
[36:27.930 --> 36:33.890]  I was thinking maybe we could as a way to reveal the item that we've been talking
[36:33.890 --> 36:36.150]  about, use it to attempt to flatten the same.
[36:37.350 --> 36:39.990]  Oh, probably that is in the cutting it.
[36:40.190 --> 36:40.250]  OK.
[36:40.510 --> 36:43.150]  OK, so your attempt, you OK.
[36:44.710 --> 36:48.590]  Gavin asked if you want your attempt in the video and you said no.
[36:48.910 --> 36:51.110]  Well, if you want to credit it as my attempt.
[36:51.210 --> 36:51.410]  Sure.
[36:51.490 --> 36:53.450]  I just that's does that doesn't matter.
[36:53.530 --> 36:55.230]  I don't care if I have an attempt in it or not.
[36:55.230 --> 36:59.450]  But just I think I would like to see the science behind it attempting to flat.
[37:00.070 --> 37:03.450]  OK, well, because you originally you wanted to you wanted an attempt with your robot.
[37:03.450 --> 37:04.250]  And I did.
[37:04.850 --> 37:07.950]  So you could do that or you could do an attempt in with your real body
[37:08.930 --> 37:10.410]  or we could use this item.
[37:10.730 --> 37:11.730]  I want to use a lot of choices.
[37:11.990 --> 37:13.930]  OK, I think we should use the item.
[37:14.290 --> 37:15.570]  I want to see what that looks like.
[37:16.250 --> 37:17.210]  I'm very fascinated.
[37:17.890 --> 37:21.250]  And then people will know in the video that will be the debut of the item.
[37:21.850 --> 37:24.170]  I if I was a fan of this podcast, I'd be so mad at us.
[37:24.210 --> 37:28.170]  Like this is like the second time in this episode where I'm just like, it's so confusing.
[37:28.370 --> 37:29.390]  You're always mad at us.
[37:30.150 --> 37:30.970]  You don't need to be a fan.
[37:31.350 --> 37:34.390]  As a fan, if I was listening to this podcast, I'd just be like,
[37:34.490 --> 37:36.370]  what the fuck are these guys talking about?
[37:36.610 --> 37:38.130]  Put the video out or don't.
[37:38.290 --> 37:39.890]  What do you think the chances are?
[37:39.990 --> 37:43.110]  The video is already out by the time this podcast comes out.
[37:43.410 --> 37:43.970]  I don't think so.
[37:44.010 --> 37:45.290]  I think it'll come out the following Friday.
[37:45.350 --> 37:47.210]  I think I think this video will be out on the 8th.
[37:47.270 --> 37:47.450]  Terrible.
[37:47.510 --> 37:49.290]  It's apparently on the calendar for this week, though.
[37:50.130 --> 37:50.490]  Yeah.
[37:50.570 --> 37:51.750]  What is the apparently?
[37:51.950 --> 37:52.210]  Yes.
[37:52.370 --> 37:54.110]  Andrew's asking us to hold it now.
[37:55.710 --> 37:57.250]  Andrew's asking us to put it out.
[37:57.350 --> 37:59.790]  He wants to do something as a part of it.
[37:59.790 --> 38:01.930]  We can put it out tomorrow.
[38:02.170 --> 38:03.430]  I have no issue with that.
[38:03.550 --> 38:05.510]  Andrew is asking to do something else with it.
[38:06.550 --> 38:09.370]  You seem confused about this whole thing.
[38:09.650 --> 38:11.770]  And I don't know what any of the confusion is.
[38:13.370 --> 38:13.870]  Earthshaker.
[38:15.430 --> 38:20.590]  OK, I'm going to get you with the pinball machine and then I'm going to use
[38:20.590 --> 38:23.450]  and then I'm going to use the auction item on you.
[38:25.450 --> 38:29.650]  I had an unexpectedly hilarious thing happen to me.
[38:29.790 --> 38:34.550]  In the midst of a not hilarious thing, my poor mom broke her ankle.
[38:34.850 --> 38:36.470]  She fell down her stairs.
[38:36.910 --> 38:37.610]  It was a whole thing.
[38:37.990 --> 38:39.490]  It's very traumatic, very scary.
[38:40.270 --> 38:41.510]  I had to call the paramedics.
[38:41.930 --> 38:42.670]  People had to come.
[38:42.750 --> 38:43.610]  It was a whole thing.
[38:44.510 --> 38:48.970]  I had never seen my mom get injured in that way before.
[38:49.350 --> 38:51.250]  So it's very shocking and upsetting.
[38:51.350 --> 38:53.530]  I was having a full meltdown.
[38:53.810 --> 38:54.750]  I'm crying.
[38:55.050 --> 38:55.910]  I'm in shock.
[38:56.230 --> 38:58.510]  And then I look at my phone, I get an alert.
[38:59.110 --> 39:00.450]  And I'm in it.
[39:00.590 --> 39:02.570]  I get put in a group chat called happy.
[39:03.290 --> 39:08.410]  By someone that has never put me in any group chat that I've ever been in before.
[39:09.070 --> 39:09.550]  What?
[39:09.810 --> 39:13.890]  And I thought because I had I just needed somewhere to like vent.
[39:14.090 --> 39:14.810]  This is in the process.
[39:14.890 --> 39:16.330]  She's getting taken care of.
[39:16.350 --> 39:18.950]  I was messaging a friend of mine of what was happening.
[39:19.430 --> 39:23.130]  And so I look and I get I'm in a group chat now called happy.
[39:23.410 --> 39:26.530]  And I'm in like this emotional wreck state.
[39:26.570 --> 39:27.390]  I'm confused.
[39:27.390 --> 39:34.210]  And my initial thought was, oh, maybe, maybe they decided to like make a support
[39:34.210 --> 39:38.990]  group chat type thing so that everyone can stay in the loop on what's happening.
[39:39.110 --> 39:41.850]  And just like, I don't know, a support place.
[39:41.990 --> 39:46.450]  But it's weird that this person put me in it because that's not who I was talking to.
[39:46.590 --> 39:50.250]  But the other person I was talking to is it's like six people in this group
[39:50.250 --> 39:51.830]  chat called happy that I've been added to.
[39:52.010 --> 39:54.010]  So they know about the broken ankle.
[39:54.010 --> 39:56.710]  Uh, people in the group chat did.
[39:56.850 --> 40:00.570]  So I thought maybe they had a conversation and I was like, maybe a group is formed.
[40:00.610 --> 40:03.330]  And like, I can just like a place I can give updates or whatever.
[40:04.010 --> 40:05.330]  But I'm just like, I'm soaking.
[40:05.470 --> 40:08.070]  This is just the timing of it is and I'll call it happy.
[40:08.790 --> 40:14.350]  And I'm trying to process crying and then a message comes through.
[40:14.750 --> 40:17.810]  And it is not an emotional support chat.
[40:17.930 --> 40:18.570]  It is not.
[40:18.870 --> 40:22.610]  This person has no idea of what I'm in the midst of in this moment.
[40:23.210 --> 40:29.730]  They wanted to organize a happy Gilmore to watch along because it came out that day.
[40:30.590 --> 40:33.170]  I am in shambles.
[40:33.590 --> 40:37.530]  And then I look at this and it's a message like, yo, guys, you won't watch that.
[40:37.690 --> 40:38.390]  Happy Gilmore.
[40:38.490 --> 40:40.030]  Adam Sandler's back, baby.
[40:40.110 --> 40:42.770]  The Sandman, Sandman's on Netflix.
[40:43.550 --> 40:49.290]  And it was like the funniest thing that could happen in that moment of this person
[40:49.290 --> 40:54.290]  with the worst time putting me in a group chat called happy when I'm at an all time low
[40:54.290 --> 41:00.830]  and that they want to watch happy Gilmore to that day was incredible.
[41:01.150 --> 41:02.790]  I just I replied to the chat.
[41:02.850 --> 41:03.890]  This is not your fault.
[41:04.270 --> 41:05.270]  You have no concept.
[41:05.510 --> 41:10.510]  But this is the worst timing you could possibly have for any of this.
[41:10.790 --> 41:11.770]  This is incredible.
[41:12.530 --> 41:15.590]  It was the greatest like unexpected laugh.
[41:15.590 --> 41:20.870]  And like, so, of course, this is the timing of this is so incredibly this show in me.
[41:21.670 --> 41:24.830]  I I bet that moment was funnier than happy Gilmore to.
[41:25.430 --> 41:26.170]  I haven't seen it yet.
[41:26.250 --> 41:27.030]  I'd like to see it.
[41:27.130 --> 41:27.770]  I saw it.
[41:27.910 --> 41:29.830]  It's it's it's it's OK.
[41:30.010 --> 41:32.430]  It's it's like a like most Adam Sandler movies.
[41:32.490 --> 41:33.250]  It's a little bit too long.
[41:33.490 --> 41:35.210]  And the end goes kind of off the rails.
[41:35.230 --> 41:40.130]  But it's worth watching, I think, especially if you like clip shows, because it is 40 percent
[41:40.130 --> 41:41.010]  clip show.
[41:42.290 --> 41:42.510]  Yeah.
[41:42.510 --> 41:47.890]  It's like, do you remember Julie Bowen carrying two mugs of beer in lingerie?
[41:48.030 --> 41:51.270]  Well, if you don't, we're going to remind you eight times in the film.
[41:52.490 --> 41:53.870]  I'm excited to see it.
[41:53.870 --> 41:58.510]  Despite I've I've heard mainly negative things, but that was not the day for it.
[41:58.790 --> 42:02.270]  That was like essentially I'm trying to think if there's any.
[42:02.370 --> 42:06.830]  Oh, we did one other thing before that that I'm very excited to talk about because I haven't
[42:06.830 --> 42:07.630]  talked about it at all.
[42:08.290 --> 42:11.870]  I've been working in the background for a long time now.
[42:12.510 --> 42:18.690]  To get our first guest on a piece of regulation content, it's been in the works for quite a
[42:18.690 --> 42:19.950]  bit, had to wait.
[42:20.490 --> 42:24.690]  And then I had to go through a process of talking to CBS about it, which is not something
[42:24.690 --> 42:25.890]  I was expecting to do.
[42:26.970 --> 42:28.390]  That was the whole thing.
[42:28.830 --> 42:33.670]  We had to be we had to be babysat by a CBS representative during the interview.
[42:34.870 --> 42:40.490]  I think it's wild how many times Andrew has been in direct contact with major corporations.
[42:42.510 --> 42:45.490]  It was a whole thing where, you know, we're independent now.
[42:45.610 --> 42:49.030]  And so just to like not tease who it is any any longer.
[42:49.230 --> 42:51.450]  Sheen, the pencil judge, a.k.a.
[42:51.650 --> 42:52.890]  Survivor contestant.
[42:54.070 --> 42:55.190]  We got to talk.
[42:55.550 --> 42:57.570]  We'd been messaging back and forth for a bit.
[42:58.930 --> 42:59.430]  They're wonderful.
[42:59.850 --> 43:03.670]  Wanted to have them on to just talk about regulation stuff and Survivor.
[43:03.890 --> 43:06.690]  So Jeff and I did an interview that I think went incredibly well.
[43:07.070 --> 43:09.810]  I'm so excited for people to hear it.
[43:09.810 --> 43:12.850]  I can't wait before I could schedule it.
[43:12.930 --> 43:15.230]  I had to go through CBS to do it.
[43:15.790 --> 43:18.910]  And we've been independent for a little bit longer than a year now.
[43:19.250 --> 43:24.290]  But it's the first time since we've been independent where there was a process of like,
[43:24.410 --> 43:25.510]  who are you?
[43:25.990 --> 43:26.330]  Why?
[43:26.470 --> 43:27.370]  Why do you desert?
[43:27.430 --> 43:32.130]  Like there was like you had to like sell yourself, sell yourself in a sense.
[43:32.230 --> 43:36.170]  And it was it felt it felt weird.
[43:36.210 --> 43:39.470]  It was a weird thing to feel like back at, you know, Rooster Teeth.
[43:39.470 --> 43:41.150]  You had to get things approved.
[43:41.310 --> 43:43.050]  And we've been so not in that space.
[43:43.070 --> 43:45.490]  There was a feeling of like, what the fuck?
[43:45.530 --> 43:47.790]  Like, I got to I got to figure this out.
[43:47.850 --> 43:52.790]  And then they asked for as for links to social media accounts.
[43:52.990 --> 43:56.910]  And our Instagram is still face, which is fantastic.
[43:58.250 --> 44:00.530]  So then, like, how do I get the keeps on again?
[44:00.870 --> 44:01.690]  It is.
[44:01.830 --> 44:03.110]  I don't know why it's still that.
[44:03.250 --> 44:04.290]  But it is that.
[44:05.670 --> 44:07.430]  But I was able to get it organized.
[44:07.430 --> 44:13.090]  Jeff and I talked to him for like 20 minutes, got deep into some survivor stuff,
[44:13.210 --> 44:15.330]  but then also a lot of regulation stuff.
[44:15.630 --> 44:19.570]  We had some rulings, genuinely wonderful person.
[44:19.810 --> 44:22.670]  But the most impressive thing to me, the thing that blew me away the most,
[44:23.010 --> 44:24.190]  he speaks regulation.
[44:24.670 --> 44:26.390]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[44:27.130 --> 44:29.250]  He came out of the gate swinging.
[44:29.730 --> 44:29.990]  It was.
[44:30.290 --> 44:30.850]  Yeah, he really did.
[44:30.930 --> 44:31.450]  He really did.
[44:31.990 --> 44:35.190]  So how long is that period where if you want to talk to him, you have to go through CBS?
[44:36.030 --> 44:36.810]  I don't know.
[44:36.810 --> 44:40.090]  I've been meaning to talk to him about that because I'd love to
[44:40.090 --> 44:42.150]  bring him on for something else in the future.
[44:42.190 --> 44:42.650]  I'd like to.
[44:42.730 --> 44:43.750]  I'd like to meet him.
[44:43.830 --> 44:45.290]  I'd like to have a beer with him or something.
[44:45.530 --> 44:47.050]  Or, you know, do I have to go through CBS?
[44:47.710 --> 44:49.110]  I don't know to what end.
[44:49.890 --> 44:53.470]  I guess if it probably involves being published,
[44:53.470 --> 44:56.010]  you probably do have to go through CBS.
[44:56.210 --> 44:57.070]  But I don't know for how long.
[44:57.870 --> 45:00.650]  I'd never consider that with like a survivor contestant.
[45:01.190 --> 45:03.750]  How long is that entryway?
[45:04.610 --> 45:05.210]  When does it close?
[45:05.250 --> 45:06.510]  It has to close soon, right?
[45:06.510 --> 45:06.850]  Yeah.
[45:07.870 --> 45:09.830]  I can't go into the next season, I would assume.
[45:10.690 --> 45:11.950]  But it's just something I've never heard of.
[45:12.010 --> 45:16.150]  But also like I've never been in a position in which I'm trying to talk to a survivor contestant.
[45:16.190 --> 45:18.730]  So now that you mentioned that, Andrew,
[45:19.950 --> 45:22.270]  how does that release and where do we release it?
[45:22.470 --> 45:24.130]  Have we figured that out?
[45:24.510 --> 45:28.590]  I figured it would just go up on wherever audio gets released for what we do.
[45:28.850 --> 45:30.630]  I think it's just the podcast feed.
[45:31.050 --> 45:31.250]  Yeah.
[45:31.250 --> 45:31.750]  OK, cool.
[45:31.910 --> 45:33.690]  So it wasn't on video, wasn't like a webcam or anything.
[45:34.170 --> 45:35.090]  We had one.
[45:35.190 --> 45:37.470]  But, you know, we don't like do video podcasts.
[45:37.790 --> 45:42.510]  So we talked and there was not really a visual element outside of the fact that
[45:43.530 --> 45:45.450]  when we started, he was holding a pencil.
[45:45.950 --> 45:49.850]  But we bring up in the fact that he spent the whole interview holding a pencil.
[45:50.470 --> 45:52.310]  Did he have any Gerpolas front and center?
[45:53.730 --> 45:54.530]  No Gerpolas.
[45:54.650 --> 45:57.810]  You know, I'd be shocked if he knew what a Gerpolas was, to be honest.
[45:58.350 --> 45:58.570]  OK.
[45:59.310 --> 46:02.430]  But in his defense, it's not like he had access to a Gerpolas
[46:02.430 --> 46:06.510]  and decided not to have one front and center.
[46:07.170 --> 46:09.350]  I have a shirt or a regulation shirt.
[46:09.470 --> 46:09.990]  You do.
[46:10.050 --> 46:11.270]  But it was, you know, it's tucked away.
[46:11.590 --> 46:13.810]  So we got into the Australian news with him.
[46:14.030 --> 46:14.550]  It's fine.
[46:15.910 --> 46:16.530]  We did.
[46:16.610 --> 46:16.930]  We did.
[46:16.970 --> 46:17.290]  We did.
[46:20.130 --> 46:23.770]  I'm very excited for people to hear we got some clear definitive.
[46:23.970 --> 46:27.830]  I think he should sort of be our general judge for any debate that we have.
[46:27.950 --> 46:28.610]  He's definitely qualified.
[46:29.190 --> 46:30.310]  He's absolutely qualified.
[46:30.650 --> 46:31.990]  So I'm so excited for that to come out.
[46:31.990 --> 46:34.090]  How did he do on on Survivor?
[46:35.730 --> 46:37.670]  Uh, he was the fifth person.
[46:38.010 --> 46:39.210]  He's his final five.
[46:39.770 --> 46:40.550]  Oh, that's great.
[46:40.950 --> 46:41.710]  Good for him.
[46:42.050 --> 46:42.870]  It was the final five, right?
[46:42.910 --> 46:43.490]  Or final six?
[46:43.710 --> 46:44.390]  I think he was six.
[46:44.670 --> 46:44.970]  Six.
[46:45.090 --> 46:45.230]  Yeah.
[46:45.310 --> 46:45.810]  Final six.
[46:46.230 --> 46:47.150]  It was right before the five.
[46:47.570 --> 46:47.890]  Still good.
[46:48.550 --> 46:49.450]  Still really good.
[46:49.550 --> 46:49.810]  Incredible.
[46:50.230 --> 46:53.250]  If he would have made it to the final five, I think he would have won the whole show.
[46:53.830 --> 46:54.470]  Completely agree.
[46:54.690 --> 46:58.210]  Like if he was in the final three definitively, and I think if he would have made it to five,
[46:58.290 --> 46:59.530]  his path to three.
[46:59.970 --> 47:02.470]  Oh, so he got chopped for being a...
[47:02.470 --> 47:04.610]  That's why they had to probably frame him to get him out.
[47:05.130 --> 47:05.290]  Yeah.
[47:05.390 --> 47:06.470]  There's a whole framing situation.
[47:06.610 --> 47:07.590]  You should watch the season, Gavin.
[47:07.650 --> 47:08.490]  It's a really fun season.
[47:09.050 --> 47:09.870]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[47:10.130 --> 47:11.350]  Good season of television.
[47:13.130 --> 47:14.170]  What are you laughing at, Nick?
[47:14.670 --> 47:15.810]  Just the way you said that.
[47:16.050 --> 47:16.750]  I will do it.
[47:17.230 --> 47:19.390]  I don't believe you, but that's okay.
[47:19.630 --> 47:20.450]  That's also fine.
[47:20.770 --> 47:21.410]  You don't have to.
[47:21.770 --> 47:22.470]  Put it on the calendar.
[47:22.690 --> 47:23.870]  Put it on the calendar.
[47:24.210 --> 47:25.510]  I'd rather that than Charmed.
[47:25.530 --> 47:26.110]  That doesn't...
[47:26.110 --> 47:28.950]  I mean, that doesn't seem to do anything for him on the calendar.
[47:28.950 --> 47:30.450]  So, I mean, it's up to you.
[47:30.510 --> 47:30.950]  I have a question.
[47:31.010 --> 47:32.150]  What calendar are you talking about?
[47:33.750 --> 47:36.350]  I assume the work one that we all have to share.
[47:38.650 --> 47:39.430]  How do I...
[47:41.930 --> 47:43.190]  Regulation releases calendar.
[47:43.650 --> 47:44.930]  Do you not have that calendar?
[47:47.810 --> 47:51.110]  I mean, I see it every Monday when you open it on your computer.
[47:51.690 --> 47:52.910]  But you don't have...
[47:52.910 --> 47:53.350]  He left.
[47:53.890 --> 47:54.430]  Eric left.
[47:55.830 --> 47:58.430]  When you open your calendar on your phone or whatever,
[47:58.430 --> 47:59.910]  you don't just have the release schedule?
[48:00.150 --> 48:02.770]  For like a year in the last four months, you haven't had it?
[48:03.130 --> 48:05.690]  No, I've got the recording schedule.
[48:05.870 --> 48:07.050]  Like when to be somewhere.
[48:08.150 --> 48:08.710]  It's the same calendar?
[48:10.490 --> 48:10.890]  No, it isn't.
[48:10.950 --> 48:12.010]  It's the same calendar.
[48:12.490 --> 48:12.790]  I have...
[48:12.790 --> 48:15.090]  Today, I have regulation podcast recording.
[48:15.230 --> 48:16.150]  I have Let's Play record.
[48:16.370 --> 48:19.850]  And on top of that, I have Charmed watch along two episodes.
[48:20.250 --> 48:22.450]  And you don't see Roadcraft 2.
[48:22.550 --> 48:23.750]  You don't see Flattest Sandwich tomorrow.
[48:23.890 --> 48:24.830]  You don't see Doomsday 7.
[48:25.490 --> 48:25.790]  No.
[48:26.770 --> 48:27.170]  Great.
[48:27.170 --> 48:28.890]  But you said they're the same calendar?
[48:29.550 --> 48:29.990]  It doesn't matter.
[48:30.330 --> 48:31.230]  It doesn't matter at this point.
[48:31.470 --> 48:31.750]  It's fine.
[48:32.010 --> 48:33.330]  Why do I have half a calendar?
[48:35.530 --> 48:36.390]  Oh, they are different.
[48:36.530 --> 48:36.670]  Oh.
[48:37.210 --> 48:38.230]  This is what I have.
[48:38.570 --> 48:39.070]  This is today.
[48:40.010 --> 48:40.310]  Great.
[48:41.270 --> 48:42.030]  That's cool, man.
[48:44.290 --> 48:47.090]  Why don't you subscribe to the other calendar then?
[48:47.350 --> 48:47.630]  Yeah.
[48:48.290 --> 48:49.730]  I don't remember subscribing to this one.
[48:49.770 --> 48:50.810]  I just have it on my email.
[48:50.990 --> 48:53.270]  You put my email address in, didn't you?
[48:53.550 --> 48:55.770]  Do you remember why we built the calendar this way, Jeff?
[48:56.570 --> 48:59.690]  Do you remember why we built this release calendar like this?
[49:00.770 --> 49:03.350]  Do you remember who we built it for?
[49:04.090 --> 49:06.970]  Who wanted the release calendar like this so that way they could keep an eye on it?
[49:07.090 --> 49:07.610]  I do.
[49:08.350 --> 49:08.750]  Yeah.
[49:09.310 --> 49:10.630]  Okay, cool.
[49:10.770 --> 49:11.290]  I was just curious.
[49:11.390 --> 49:11.750]  It doesn't matter.
[49:12.010 --> 49:13.350]  Again, if I was a fan of this show, I'd be pissed.
[49:13.490 --> 49:13.790]  It's fine.
[49:14.850 --> 49:16.230]  I hate being in the middle.
[49:18.470 --> 49:20.370]  Get someone off that other side then, man.
[49:20.590 --> 49:21.450]  I don't know what to tell you.
[49:22.990 --> 49:24.930]  But if you make the calendar,
[49:24.930 --> 49:27.790]  don't you have to add people's email addresses to it?
[49:30.770 --> 49:32.770]  How did I get on this one?
[49:33.910 --> 49:34.330]  Fuck.
[49:35.570 --> 49:35.990]  You.
[49:38.790 --> 49:41.290]  Look, I'm certainly in the wrong here,
[49:41.410 --> 49:43.370]  but I don't know how I have this one.
[49:43.890 --> 49:46.530]  I don't know how I have this one and not the other one is what I'm saying.
[49:47.850 --> 49:51.530]  It's more just how have you not noticed or commented on it until this moment.
[49:52.530 --> 49:54.390]  I mean, there's an invite.
[49:54.550 --> 49:55.530]  There's an invite for you.
[49:55.530 --> 49:59.090]  You can make changes and manage sharing within the calendar.
[49:59.350 --> 50:01.270]  You can see all the events within the calendar.
[50:02.190 --> 50:04.650]  Already added you on this list.
[50:05.590 --> 50:10.910]  So I should delete my folder of screenshots of your screen on Mondays?
[50:11.790 --> 50:13.050]  You've been taking screenshots?
[50:13.970 --> 50:15.930]  You're a psycho.
[50:16.070 --> 50:18.770]  I'm looking at your invite right here, dude.
[50:18.770 --> 50:19.750]  I don't know.
[50:19.970 --> 50:23.690]  I really don't know how you operate a business.
[50:24.050 --> 50:25.110]  Not this one.
[50:25.110 --> 50:27.970]  The other one, because this is crazy.
[50:28.670 --> 50:32.810]  Well, the other one is just this whole time we've been doing this for a year
[50:32.810 --> 50:37.050]  and this whole time you've never had that calendar on your calendar.
[50:37.850 --> 50:40.650]  No, you've never had the regulation releases calendar,
[50:40.890 --> 50:42.430]  but I've got screenshots.
[50:43.430 --> 50:45.110]  I'm so floored.
[50:45.190 --> 50:48.290]  Like, I'm like, I'm absolutely stunned.
[50:48.650 --> 50:50.470]  I'm stunned right now.
[50:50.750 --> 50:52.410]  I cannot believe this.
[50:52.570 --> 50:53.670]  So if I press calendars.
[50:55.110 --> 50:58.490]  Sounds like something you should add to your things that Gavin learned list.
[50:58.650 --> 51:00.630]  I have mine and now you have yours.
[51:01.190 --> 51:01.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:01.730 --> 51:03.950]  Anything new on that calendar or on that on that list?
[51:03.990 --> 51:05.170]  Andrew, you got anything new that you learned?
[51:05.310 --> 51:09.090]  So, Gavin, if you look at my calendars on the left of the screen, what do you see?
[51:12.280 --> 51:14.020]  If I look at your calendars?
[51:14.160 --> 51:16.020]  Oh, my God.
[51:16.020 --> 51:16.740]  Hold on a second.
[51:18.140 --> 51:19.260]  Why even bother?
[51:19.380 --> 51:21.000]  Like, why even do this?
[51:22.220 --> 51:25.440]  Like, there's a thing at the bottom of the screenshot that you said that said
[51:25.440 --> 51:27.000]  like calendars.
[51:27.220 --> 51:28.520]  Yeah, that's what I just pressed when I said.
[51:28.600 --> 51:29.820]  So if I press calendars.
[51:30.060 --> 51:31.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:33.140 --> 51:36.500]  And you don't see anything that says regulation releases or anything like that?
[51:36.600 --> 51:37.920]  No, but I am subscribed to a.
[51:38.200 --> 51:39.160]  Oh, you're on a desktop.
[51:40.860 --> 51:41.220]  Regulation.
[51:41.580 --> 51:42.740]  Well, I mean, that's what we're recording.
[51:42.940 --> 51:43.100]  Yeah.
[51:43.280 --> 51:43.420]  Yeah.
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.220]  What are you recording on?
[51:45.080 --> 51:46.480]  He's just playing on his phone, too.
[51:46.520 --> 51:46.860]  It's fine.
[51:47.440 --> 51:49.040]  No, I don't have my calendar on this PC.
[51:49.380 --> 51:49.940]  Let's see.
[51:52.100 --> 51:54.500]  Now, I'm on the work calendar of someone who
[51:55.140 --> 51:55.940]  is dead.
[51:59.560 --> 52:01.360]  What the fuck?
[52:02.700 --> 52:04.240]  We got any content coming out?
[52:04.740 --> 52:08.560]  But my slow-mo calendar holidays in the United Kingdom.
[52:10.880 --> 52:14.280]  This is I'm like, I just don't.
[52:14.380 --> 52:18.860]  So how do I get regulation releases to show up in my because I don't have the option for it here.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.340]  So how do I get it to be?
[52:20.600 --> 52:21.520]  It should be under my account.
[52:21.520 --> 52:24.760]  You probably have to go in your email and accept the invite.
[52:25.600 --> 52:26.760]  Shit, that's crazy.
[52:26.940 --> 52:27.440]  I'll do that later.
[52:28.080 --> 52:28.840]  No, you won't.
[52:30.060 --> 52:32.460]  No, let's send them a new invite right now.
[52:32.560 --> 52:33.180]  Hold on.
[52:37.170 --> 52:41.590]  I feel like if I was a listener of this episode, I'd be so annoyed at just me specifically.
[52:42.190 --> 52:42.950]  Yeah, 100%.
[52:42.950 --> 52:43.670]  I agree with you.
[52:43.870 --> 52:44.890]  Yeah, 100%.
[52:44.890 --> 52:45.490]  I apologize.
[52:45.950 --> 52:46.310]  I apologize.
[52:47.070 --> 52:48.290]  I just sent it to you again.
[52:48.490 --> 52:49.930]  But I've never missed an editing deadline.
[52:50.390 --> 52:51.290]  I've always got my screenshots.
[52:53.790 --> 52:54.230]  Cool.
[52:55.930 --> 52:57.370]  He's always got.
[52:57.650 --> 53:02.550]  I would credit less the screenshots and more us going, hey, is that going to come out?
[53:02.610 --> 53:03.250]  Is that OK?
[53:03.370 --> 53:04.430]  Do you need that moved?
[53:04.890 --> 53:07.770]  I'm impressed that you cared enough to take screenshots, honestly.
[53:08.270 --> 53:11.590]  Yeah, I felt kind of bad about it because it always has like Eric Dentist
[53:11.590 --> 53:13.570]  in the middle of the freaking week as well.
[53:13.810 --> 53:14.010]  It's true.
[53:14.330 --> 53:15.530]  It's my whole calendar.
[53:15.830 --> 53:19.370]  Yeah, but at least I know when not to bother you at the dentist.
[53:24.290 --> 53:25.430]  Oh, my God.
[53:25.610 --> 53:29.210]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[53:29.570 --> 53:32.450]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[53:32.610 --> 53:36.150]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[53:36.590 --> 53:38.010]  Available for a limited time.
[53:38.270 --> 53:40.290]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[53:41.330 --> 53:44.050]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[53:44.410 --> 53:47.730]  Checking off the boxes on your to do list is a great feeling.
[53:48.010 --> 53:49.950]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[53:49.950 --> 53:53.370]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[53:53.610 --> 53:57.850]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or using the award winning app,
[53:58.090 --> 54:01.570]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[54:01.910 --> 54:03.830]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[54:06.350 --> 54:07.690]  Anyway, I re-shared it with you.
[54:07.730 --> 54:11.090]  Andrew learned about Spy Kids 28 and reject the cookies.
[54:11.750 --> 54:14.110]  Yeah, those are my most recent discoveries.
[54:14.910 --> 54:15.430]  What?
[54:16.550 --> 54:19.350]  What is Spy Kids 28?
[54:19.350 --> 54:22.970]  I learned that Carla Gugino is 28 years old
[54:22.970 --> 54:26.310]  as the mom in the first Spy Kids and that blew my mind.
[54:26.490 --> 54:29.530]  Because as a kid who watched Spy Kids, she felt like old mom.
[54:30.050 --> 54:33.610]  And the fact that I am now two years older than she was in Spy Kids,
[54:33.890 --> 54:36.030]  and she had Spy Kids, crazy.
[54:36.590 --> 54:40.930]  I think I've been in love with Carla Gugino since like the early 90s.
[54:41.150 --> 54:41.430]  Yep.
[54:42.030 --> 54:42.750]  It's very fair.
[54:43.250 --> 54:45.550]  Since like, probably son-in-law.
[54:45.970 --> 54:46.250]  Whoa.
[54:46.250 --> 54:50.490]  Yeah, since Pauly Shore, like son-in-law.
[54:51.070 --> 54:52.030]  So expect to one.
[54:53.130 --> 54:53.170]  Yeah.
[54:54.270 --> 54:57.850]  They're like a weird Hollywood actor celebrity type thing for me
[54:57.850 --> 55:00.010]  where I can't imagine them doing normal things.
[55:01.170 --> 55:06.250]  I can't imagine them flattening a sandwich, a Subway sandwich.
[55:06.730 --> 55:07.370]  Can't see it.
[55:07.390 --> 55:08.210]  You know, normal thing.
[55:08.230 --> 55:09.910]  Do you think that's a normal thing?
[55:10.070 --> 55:14.830]  Well, just even having a, I don't know, like seeing them in line at Subway would feel weird to me.
[55:14.830 --> 55:19.530]  I can't imagine them seeing, honestly, seeing any people in line at Subway.
[55:19.530 --> 55:22.650]  Yeah, you probably, it's not a line situation.
[55:23.350 --> 55:25.610]  I hope it would be weird to see me at Subway.
[55:27.290 --> 55:28.750]  You know, you fit.
[55:30.130 --> 55:31.750]  Those in Stanhut is weird in my brain.
[55:31.830 --> 55:33.670]  That passes the test of weird, not weird.
[55:34.950 --> 55:37.150]  Do you know what's so crazy at 28 for me?
[55:37.690 --> 55:37.910]  What?
[55:38.370 --> 55:41.230]  Is that Heath Ledger was the Joker at 28.
[55:42.470 --> 55:43.990]  Wow, that's crazy.
[55:44.130 --> 55:44.510]  Isn't that nuts?
[55:45.010 --> 55:46.390]  He feels at least 32.
[55:48.570 --> 55:49.590]  So he died.
[55:49.710 --> 55:50.810]  How old was he when he died?
[55:51.570 --> 55:53.210]  Is that who you have on your calendar?
[55:53.310 --> 55:54.850]  Do you have Heath Ledger's calendar on here?
[55:55.450 --> 55:57.450]  No, no, it's not his one.
[55:59.410 --> 56:02.390]  This stops at the Imaginarium of Dr. Varnassus back in.
[56:03.130 --> 56:04.330]  He was 28 when he died.
[56:04.830 --> 56:05.770]  28, that's crazy.
[56:06.530 --> 56:08.250]  I would say it's probably 27 then when he filmed it.
[56:08.590 --> 56:08.770]  Maybe.
[56:09.430 --> 56:10.190]  That's insane.
[56:10.610 --> 56:11.410]  You're, yeah.
[56:12.150 --> 56:14.810]  Although he did, did he die like right after they filmed?
[56:15.670 --> 56:18.250]  He died January of 2008.
[56:18.730 --> 56:22.930]  So it's probably not right after they filmed it, but it was probably pretty close.
[56:23.410 --> 56:28.430]  Hey, do we have any updates on any park benches that we may be dedicating in any of the states yet?
[56:29.790 --> 56:34.930]  Dude, no, we got a lead on one at the San Diego Zoo that would be like a lot of fun.
[56:35.250 --> 56:37.730]  Do we have like $50,000?
[56:38.610 --> 56:41.430]  It's so, it's so insane.
[56:41.430 --> 56:43.010]  So that was our first avenue.
[56:43.290 --> 56:46.990]  And then we will be looking at other park benches.
[56:47.290 --> 56:51.770]  If you know of a park bench that you think that we should go for, a park of some kind,
[56:51.850 --> 56:54.570]  let us know because that points us in like the right direction.
[56:54.950 --> 56:58.870]  But the San Diego Zoo want to, you know, shout out the regulation listener who's like,
[56:58.970 --> 57:00.790]  hey dude, I do some stuff with like Safari Park.
[57:01.130 --> 57:03.770]  He's like, it will be cost prohibitive, but like I'll put you in contact.
[57:05.890 --> 57:08.010]  Cost prohibitive was a light way to put it, dude.
[57:08.110 --> 57:08.970]  It's crazy.
[57:10.350 --> 57:14.290]  I want to, I want to get into the second thing I learned before we moved too far away,
[57:14.690 --> 57:15.590]  which is reject the cookies.
[57:16.290 --> 57:19.450]  I've been accepting cookies on every website I go onto because I thought I had to.
[57:19.650 --> 57:20.890]  Didn't know you didn't have to.
[57:21.650 --> 57:22.770]  There's two options though.
[57:22.830 --> 57:24.310]  It's like reject or accept.
[57:24.590 --> 57:28.690]  I, at some point in my life felt like I had heard that if you reject the cookies,
[57:28.810 --> 57:29.970]  you can't go onto the site.
[57:30.530 --> 57:33.370]  And I always want to see the information on the site.
[57:33.750 --> 57:35.650]  So I would always accept the cookies.
[57:36.270 --> 57:38.630]  I just learned you don't need to accept the cookies.
[57:38.970 --> 57:39.290]  Yeah.
[57:39.330 --> 57:42.130]  I mean, I feel like it's like sometimes there's like a feature of the site that won't work.
[57:42.370 --> 57:44.730]  I had it in my understanding of it.
[57:44.830 --> 57:50.010]  I couldn't view the thing I wanted to look at the news story or the product or whatever,
[57:50.430 --> 57:51.890]  unless I accepted the cookies.
[57:52.030 --> 57:54.110]  So I've been accepting cookies left and right.
[57:54.330 --> 57:57.170]  Every site you give me some cookies, I'm accepting the cookies.
[57:57.810 --> 57:59.850]  I can reject the cookies, didn't know.
[57:59.870 --> 58:02.670]  I mean, you probably got a warning message one time that said,
[58:02.730 --> 58:06.910]  if you reject the cookies, you won't be able to see the items in this frame or whatever.
[58:06.910 --> 58:09.330]  And so you that's how you got it into your head.
[58:09.470 --> 58:12.630]  It is possible that some features on websites don't work without cookies.
[58:12.730 --> 58:13.990]  I think there was a news story.
[58:14.090 --> 58:18.250]  I think there was a policy change like over a decade ago that made cookies more prevalent.
[58:18.730 --> 58:23.570]  And I was one of those like headline things where I read it and didn't read the story
[58:23.570 --> 58:27.470]  or maybe heard someone talk about it, but like did no research into it.
[58:27.590 --> 58:28.750]  And that was my takeaway.
[58:29.090 --> 58:31.930]  So I've been living in an accept all cookies lifestyle
[58:31.930 --> 58:36.330]  ever since that moment for like 10 plus years, I'd assume.
[58:36.330 --> 58:38.650]  So I've just been accepting cookies everywhere.
[58:38.730 --> 58:41.210]  Didn't know it was a thing that people didn't do.
[58:42.330 --> 58:46.290]  Some I am rejecting cookies now saying no to the cookies.
[58:47.550 --> 58:48.390]  Have you noticed?
[58:48.590 --> 58:49.970]  Have you noticed a change in your life?
[58:50.230 --> 58:54.270]  Not a single goddamn thing has changed, but I'm rejecting those cookies now.
[58:55.230 --> 58:56.510]  I've had too many of them.
[58:57.010 --> 58:59.590]  I guess it's like you're allowing them to like track.
[58:59.690 --> 59:00.090]  I don't know.
[59:00.730 --> 59:00.990]  It's bad.
[59:01.190 --> 59:04.390]  Like saves the thing and then it can like tell where you've been from that site
[59:04.390 --> 59:07.210]  and report back to the original site.
[59:07.330 --> 59:08.650]  Some tracking stuff.
[59:08.670 --> 59:09.590]  I don't want reporting.
[59:09.890 --> 59:11.150]  They don't need that data.
[59:11.350 --> 59:16.010]  They don't need to report to where I know where I just don't bother accepting.
[59:16.530 --> 59:17.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:17.750 --> 59:20.570]  Well, so I'm living that lifestyle now rejecting the cookies.
[59:20.790 --> 59:21.930]  What's your favorite cookie?
[59:22.710 --> 59:23.870]  I love a peanut butter cookie.
[59:24.290 --> 59:25.410]  Oh, interesting.
[59:25.770 --> 59:31.230]  Some chunks, maybe some Reese's chunks in it like a soft or a hard peanut butter cookie.
[59:31.650 --> 59:32.210]  Soft.
[59:32.630 --> 59:34.650]  Yeah, that's more of a soft cookie.
[59:34.730 --> 59:35.590]  That's the way that's the way.
[59:36.830 --> 59:37.930]  Why'd you say it like that?
[59:38.830 --> 59:39.930]  I'm right there with you.
[59:40.530 --> 59:40.690]  What?
[59:40.750 --> 59:42.210]  You like your cookies hard, Gavin?
[59:42.810 --> 59:45.370]  That just seemed a little bit orgasmic about it.
[59:46.110 --> 59:48.150]  You ever had a good soft cookie?
[59:50.030 --> 59:51.290]  He's he likes peanut butter.
[59:51.350 --> 59:52.090]  I like chocolate chip.
[59:52.250 --> 59:53.050]  Holy shit, man.
[59:53.070 --> 59:56.330]  You give me a good soft chocolate chip cookie all gooey and warm and hot.
[59:56.390 --> 59:57.690]  It is kind of sexual.
[01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:06.790]  I don't see the soft chocolate chip doesn't do it for me, but you did say warm and that is pretty
[01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:11.050]  good if it's fresh out, like if it's, you know, like it hasn't solidified yet.
[01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.430]  Warm, real good.
[01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:18.110]  But like you can get a pretty shitty soft chocolate chip cookie.
[01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:19.110]  I have found.
[01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.790]  Oh, for sure.
[01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:22.570]  There are bad soft chocolate chip cookies for sure.
[01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.650]  I don't know if I've had a bad soft peanut butter cookie.
[01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:28.650]  I don't think I have.
[01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:31.110]  Gavin strikes me even though he said he isn't.
[01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.430]  I feel like UK is like, yeah, we only do our cookies hard.
[01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.370]  We only got hard cookies.
[01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.390]  You can hammer nails with the cookies in England.
[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.550]  Yeah, we don't cook our bacon all the way through.
[01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.190]  And we have hard cookies.
[01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:46.630]  Overcooked the overcooked the cookie undercooked the bacon.
[01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.450]  It's the British way.
[01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:54.710]  I saw 28 years later the other day, and there's a scene in it in the beginning where a kid
[01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:59.250]  pockets some bacon and then gives it to somebody and the reveal of the bacon.
[01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:00.490]  I was like, that's not cooked enough.
[01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.730]  That's some shit bacon.
[01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:02.910]  I would not want that bacon.
[01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:04.550]  UK style.
[01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:05.810]  Don't like that bacon.
[01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:07.610]  Don't like your soft bacon, Gavin.
[01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.470]  Chew on this for a while, asshole.
[01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:11.790]  I don't know why you prefer burnt bacon.
[01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:15.030]  It's crunchy and crispy and it makes it saltier.
[01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:17.110]  Oh, it's so much better than soft.
[01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:20.710]  You know, it's almost a good crispy bacon is almost sexual.
[01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:23.370]  Do you want a crispy steak?
[01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:25.970]  Uh, why?
[01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:28.870]  Why is that suddenly the meat that's crispy?
[01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:33.030]  Do you think bacon and steak are like comparable meats?
[01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:36.270]  I think they're very different in texture and experience.
[01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:37.610]  It's like Gammon.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.300]  Yeah, the casino.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.320]  No, that's backgammon.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.580]  This is frontgammon I'm talking about.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:54.720]  There's a lack of thickness to bacon that I think doesn't translate
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.040]  well and also you want to sear.
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.280]  So like your point.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.180]  I don't understand your point with a steak like you want the inside to be.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.160]  Soft juicy, but the softer, but the outside to have a little crisp to it.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.000]  I wouldn't want to put it on a fork and have it stick out horizontally without bending.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.460]  I mean, what's the best part of a brisket?
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.540]  The burnt ends.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.300]  That's pretty good.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.040]  Like a good brisket.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.220]  Hey, the end of this episode has just been you guys saying foods and going.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.920]  I'm uh, I'm back on meat pretty hard right now.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.900]  Hell yeah, that's right.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.460]  Nick knows.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:35.920]  Nick knows.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.920]  No, I'm all I'm still off hot dogs, but I'm on.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.320]  I'm on.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:40.960]  I got this.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:45.560]  My father-in-law has one of those ninja electric wood fire grills.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.060]  This is not sponsored by the way.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.140]  This is just he had one and I was bitching about how I love to grill.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.980]  But I hate propane.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.040]  I hate dealing with switching out the canisters all the time.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.620]  And I hate charcoal now because you have to set up a grill and like 45 minutes to an
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.320]  hour in advance of when you want to cook.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:08.080]  And if all you wanted to cook was like one steak for Emily and I to share and a couple
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.400]  of Brussels sprouts, it's way too much work.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.340]  It's way too time prohibitive.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.960]  So I just don't grill anymore.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.980]  But he had one of those things and uh, I, I, he used it and it made good ass steak.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.600]  So I bought one and I've made steak every night now that I've had it.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.300]  That's delicious.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.620]  I love that for you.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.280]  You turn it on.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.800]  It takes like seven minutes to heat up.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.340]  Then you, it has a thermometer that comes out of the machine that you just put right in the
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.420]  steak so that it just like beeps when it's done.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.860]  It turns itself off when it's done.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:34.800]  You don't have to do shit.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.960]  You have to flip a steak once, but that's like it.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.300]  I wonder if we made a list of soft foods and hard foods, which one would dominate?
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.540]  What side would we end up going on?
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.620]  What like foods that can be hard and soft or just one?
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.580]  No, just like one or the other.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.440]  Either hard.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.040]  If you could only have harder or soft food, I think I'd probably go soft.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.040]  Yeah.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.340]  Cause I'm thinking like mashed potatoes and soups.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.580]  All the soups in the world you have access to.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.720]  No, I'll trade the soups for nothing.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.120]  I'll give hard food soups for future considerations.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.400]  I don't need soup in my life.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.360]  Get that out of here.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.400]  A good soup or a good stew in the winter is nice.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.580]  Do you wish that a hot popsicle could be a thing?
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:17.840]  No, no.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.680]  Like imagine if you could suck on a soup.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.540]  No stick, but it wouldn't be cold.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.780]  I think that'd be delicious.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:25.700]  Hotsicle.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.240]  Yeah.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:26.660]  Yeah.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.300]  Okay.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.940]  Well, on the back of the hotsicle and maybe walking back a step or two,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.100]  it is after the first of the month in August.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:41.500]  And with that comes the end of our dog count, a year long adventure
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.000]  that we've been in the middle of.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.820]  How are you guys?
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.100]  I'll go over the numbers here shortly.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.980]  But how are you guys feeling about the dog count where we kept count?
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.820]  If you're not familiar, kept count of every hot dog that we ate for a full calendar year.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.900]  I'm feeling pretty good about my count.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.280]  I thought it was a fascinating experiment.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.640]  And I'm really proud of us for maintaining it for the entirety of one year.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.560]  It doesn't feel like we started this a year ago.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.420]  You know, it's cool that we were able to keep up with it.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.080]  Yeah.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:09.680]  And we did.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.680]  There was a Slack channel.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.420]  It definitely skewed the results on my end.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.320]  I probably had twice as many dogs as I usually would in a year.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.200]  I would even go as far as maybe three X for you.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:23.960]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:24.740]  You don't know me.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.360]  Uh, shit.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.300]  I think he's got me there.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]  I would say he does.
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.380]  Well, um, can I run down the dog count numbers?
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:31.780]  Is that okay?
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.700]  Please read the numbers.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.280]  And then dog count from lowest to highest.
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:37.420]  Again, not a contest.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:43.300]  In fifth place, Gavin Free, nine hot dogs.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:43.720]  Not bad.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:45.100]  Not bad.
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:52.560]  In fourth place, Eric Badour, 24 hot dogs.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.140]  The bronze medalist, not a contest.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.180]  Andrew Panton, 27 hot dogs.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:10.720]  The silver medalist, Nick Schwartz, 37 hot dogs.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.540]  That's a lot of dogs.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.800]  It's a lot of hot dogs.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.980]  Finally, in our year long hot dog eating count.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.940]  First place, the gold medalist, the way that we all knew it would be.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:29.000]  Jeff Ramsey, with a final count, 62 hot dogs.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:29.920]  That's crazy.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:30.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.000]  I guess at the end of the day, I just have that dog in me.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:33.500]  What do you do?
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.800]  Well, you definitely have that dog in you.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.420]  You've had so much of that dog in you, you no longer want any more dog to be part of you.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.900]  I'm done dogging.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.680]  Much like I've written off corndogs for the rest of my life.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:52.820]  I'm seriously considering taking 2020, that back half of 2025 and the first half of 2026
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.500]  off of hot dogs.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.380]  It's like seven years worth of dogs for me.
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:03.160]  I didn't even hit the national average for one year, which is something in the 70s.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.560]  There's no fucking way that that is accurate.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.580]  Makes no sense.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.840]  Zero percent chance.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.460]  We thought the number was bullshit when I first read it.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:17.980]  And now I can confirm there's no fucking way those numbers on the National Hot Dog Sausage
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.680]  Council's website are correct.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.740]  It can't be.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.440]  I went out of my way to eat hot dogs at every opportunity, and I still felt like 10 short
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.520]  of the national average.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.600]  I don't buy it.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:33.060]  I will say I will probably eat an onion dog in there every once in a while because that
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.640]  is a different beast altogether.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.260]  Yes.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.740]  But yeah, I'm fucking burned out on hot dogs.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.980]  I never thought I'd see the day this whole thing started because I asked you guys a question.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.820]  What's a food you never say no to when it's offered to you?
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.880]  And for me, it was a hot dog.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.160]  I now feel comfortable saying no to hot dogs.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.320]  That's wild.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.100]  Do we know of any other national averages that we should take into the next year?
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:57.460]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.260]  I leave a comment.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.160]  If you guys know some another, leave your sources as well.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.220]  Some national averages for some other foods that we might want to attempt this with.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.900]  I think that's a really good idea, Gavin.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.600]  I didn't even consider doing it with something else.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.640]  I feel like it makes sense to have a passive experiment working every year.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.080]  I think I completely agree.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:15.840]  I like that.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.400]  I really, I really like making a slack channel for this.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.820]  Hey, Gav, how did your PA account end?
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.320]  I ended the year on.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.280]  What was it for?
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.020]  That on four.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.060]  Yeah, it was.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:31.760]  It was on four.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.500]  And then the final picture was a picture of Paya and you just said couldn't face it.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.620]  Well, I did three in one trip to Spain and I thought, OK, one last one in on the on the
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:45.520]  app in the airport on the way back and couldn't bring myself to do it.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.200]  As is customary, I was hanging out with your wife and not you.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:54.640]  The other day we were playing bingo and she was telling me she was like, so you're going
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.380]  to win the hot dog count.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.340]  And I'm like, it's not a competition.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.840]  But yes, I'm absolutely going to win.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.560]  And she was like, you know what you should do?
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.400]  And she was really pushing me on this.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.220]  And I'm not going to do it because I don't like seafood, but she was really pushing me
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:05.600]  for it.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:11.260]  She's like, you need to go and find five payas in Austin and eat them this week before
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.620]  the 31st.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:16.480]  And then you can beat him in the hot dog count and the Paya account.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.680]  That's my wife suggesting that.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.500]  Forcefully suggesting that.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:22.240]  Wow.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.480]  You didn't want to do it?
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.520]  No, I've never had Paya.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.140]  And it seemed like a weird way to start.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.340]  Yeah, that's fair.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.580]  I did five of these.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.800]  You can take five Paya, please.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.000]  But I love, I love how devious she is.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:38.980]  She really wanted to get you.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:39.980]  She's great.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.300]  That's why I like her.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.280]  I have a calendar update and it's brought back a lot of memories.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:46.480]  Oh, no.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.500]  I'll just post this.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.020]  Oh, wrong computer.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.180]  Press enter on the wrong keyboard.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.080]  All right.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.360]  This, I remember this now.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.120]  This is what happens.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.380]  When I click that calendar.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.360]  What am I?
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.340]  What am I looking at?
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.680]  So it's unchecked.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.380]  Yes, a little video is unchecked on the side.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.680]  And then I go and check that to put all the entries in.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.440]  And it just disappears.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.240]  The calendar deletes itself from my calendars.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.880]  Yeah, I remember doing this.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.260]  I remember trying like four times to put this one on.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.720]  I do remember this now.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.140]  You could have saved yourself a lot of getting yelled at.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.000]  If you just would have shown us this 20 minutes ago.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:24.900]  Yeah, I forgot.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.660]  You are completely absolved of any guilt.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.040]  Other than maybe we could have discussed this and worked something out.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.240]  Yeah, because the screenshot thing, as I was describing what I do.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.720]  I was thinking of like how much of an Andrew approach that is to a technical problem.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.340]  Like I'm jumping through all kinds of different hoops
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.480]  than just jumping through the one correct hoop.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.180]  And yeah, that's why it just doesn't work.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:49.620]  Doesn't work for me.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.040]  How weird.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.000]  What do we do?
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.560]  How do we go forward?
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.040]  I don't know.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:56.620]  Gavin?
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.080]  Maybe I could try on a different email address.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.320]  Maybe you need to have another plan.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:03.460]  Yeah.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.000]  Well, either way, we're going to figure it out on the next episode.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.460]  Thank you guys so much for listening.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.380]  Go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.480]  Hopefully you got a Gerpler.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.640]  We had our Gerpler release.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.520]  I imagine an immediate success.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.320]  Also some patches, I think as well.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:19.960]  Yep.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.100]  So thank you guys for coming through.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.880]  Appreciate you listening to the podcast.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.080]  Andrew, any final words for the people listening?
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.840]  I got some new cats.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:30.740]  Okay.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.660]  Oh my god.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.860]  Find out about his new cats next time.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.180]  Bye.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.080]  What about our final words?
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.580]  I just gave it to Andrew.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.040]  Oh.
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.220]  Be on the lookout for pigeon merch.
