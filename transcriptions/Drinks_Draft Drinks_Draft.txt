[00:01.060 --> 00:02.540]  The summer sun hums.
[00:03.580 --> 00:06.200]  And all you crave is something cold and crisp.
[00:06.740 --> 00:07.620]  So you pour it.
[00:08.820 --> 00:12.340]  An icy cocktail made with Tequila Don Julio.
[00:12.920 --> 00:15.300]  Crafted with 100% Blue Weber Agave.
[00:15.520 --> 00:16.860]  Born under the Mexican sun.
[00:17.120 --> 00:20.140]  And made to be shared when the day runs long and the light gets golden.

[00:26.740 --> 00:28.860]  Imported by Diageo Americas, New York, New York.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.460]  Hello and welcome to another draft.
[00:32.960 --> 00:35.500]  We have to start with ANAG of course first.
[00:35.700 --> 00:38.500]  This draft is non-alcoholic beverages.
[00:39.100 --> 00:42.880]  I'm excited to see how everyone goes with this direction.
[00:43.300 --> 00:44.940]  You can go so many ways, so many drinks.
[00:45.340 --> 00:46.560]  Where did this idea come from?
[00:47.800 --> 00:49.400]  I'm a big drink guy.
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.140]  I really like drinks and we're getting into the summer season.
[00:52.640 --> 00:57.020]  And part of the summer season for me is enjoying a nice cold beverage.
[00:57.780 --> 00:59.120]  Non-alcoholic for me.
[00:59.120 --> 01:01.520]  Are you really a big drinks guy?
[01:01.600 --> 01:05.520]  Because I would guess that you've had less than 1% of all drinks.
[01:06.640 --> 01:09.080]  I bet you've had way more drinks than you've had.
[01:09.660 --> 01:10.980]  We're going to line up the drinks.
[01:11.540 --> 01:13.600]  Well now, hold on, hold on.
[01:13.740 --> 01:17.460]  Because Gavin is an alcoholic drink guy, which opens him up to a whole other world of drinks.
[01:17.460 --> 01:18.200]  It does.
[01:19.520 --> 01:20.160]  It's a great point.
[01:20.340 --> 01:20.760]  An alcoholic drink guy?
[01:21.260 --> 01:23.240]  Well, I mean, you drink alcohol on occasion.
[01:23.700 --> 01:24.760]  You have consumed alcohol.
[01:25.100 --> 01:28.380]  And Andrew said earlier he doesn't drink alcohol.
[01:28.380 --> 01:30.540]  Not like an alcohol guy who drinks.
[01:30.560 --> 01:31.100]  No, no, no.
[01:31.240 --> 01:31.960]  An alcoholic guy.
[01:32.980 --> 01:35.680]  You're open to alcohol is what he's saying, so there's a wider range.
[01:36.240 --> 01:37.800]  Nobody's saying you're an alcoholic.
[01:38.080 --> 01:42.300]  We're saying you're just not restricted in what you drink in a way that Andrew is.
[01:42.320 --> 01:44.860]  Yeah, I just heard alcoholic drink guy and I was like, oh, maybe I've got a problem.
[01:47.320 --> 01:48.560]  Well, I got news for you, buddy.
[01:48.660 --> 01:50.900]  If you're afraid you have a problem, you have a problem.
[01:52.840 --> 01:55.200]  I hate to break it to you, this is the blind side.
[01:55.780 --> 01:56.500]  Oh, no.
[01:56.500 --> 01:57.680]  This is your intervention.
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.560]  Alcoholics love you very much.
[02:03.040 --> 02:04.960]  I haven't had a drink in four months.
[02:06.080 --> 02:06.900]  You must be thirsty.
[02:11.140 --> 02:13.640]  You guys are talking just before we start.
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.160]  You guys are talking about how your drinks guys, how many drinks you've had or whatever.
[02:17.440 --> 02:20.560]  This is the hardest draft list I have ever had to put together.
[02:20.780 --> 02:23.900]  I am not a drinks guy at all.
[02:23.900 --> 02:24.000]  Really?
[02:24.780 --> 02:26.360]  You strike me as a drinks guy.
[02:26.360 --> 02:28.060]  I guess non-alcoholic drinks guy.
[02:28.380 --> 02:29.700]  Yeah, I'm not a drinks guy.
[02:29.920 --> 02:33.860]  Are you? Are you an alcohol? Really? Like even alcohol? You strike me as a drinks guy.
[02:33.920 --> 02:36.160]  Oh, I'll drink. I drink booze. Like, that's fine.
[02:36.240 --> 02:42.540]  But like, as far as like just getting a drink for like pleasure is so like...
[02:42.540 --> 02:44.660]  You have like pleasure drink equipment.
[02:45.520 --> 02:45.800]  Yeah.
[02:46.580 --> 02:49.840]  Right. And so that's one thing on my list.
[02:50.520 --> 02:57.620]  And then trying to round out the next is that is like I'm going like, do I like this drink?
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.060]  It's so bad. I feel like my draft list is going to be rough.
[03:02.500 --> 03:03.640]  I'm excited to see it.
[03:04.380 --> 03:07.360]  Completely understand where Eric is coming from when I sat down.
[03:07.580 --> 03:09.080]  And because I think I thought like, oh, cool.
[03:09.080 --> 03:11.240]  This would be fun for me because I don't drink alcohol anymore.
[03:11.420 --> 03:14.480]  And I'm having soda summer, you know, and so I've been trying.
[03:14.580 --> 03:17.000]  I bought so many sodas over to Gavin's house last weekend.
[03:17.040 --> 03:18.800]  Meg thanks you, by the way. She's tearing through those.
[03:18.800 --> 03:21.280]  Oh, good, good. That's what they're there for.
[03:21.380 --> 03:25.740]  I want you guys to experience soda summer, learn about new flavors, find new drinks.
[03:25.740 --> 03:26.860]  Is there soda summer this weekend?
[03:27.040 --> 03:27.880]  That's what it's all about.
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.880]  We can have soda summer this weekend.
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.120]  However, when I sat down to write my list, I realized I don't really give a shit about any of it.
[03:36.280 --> 03:36.800]  I really...
[03:38.140 --> 03:39.860]  It's whatever. It's fine.
[03:41.520 --> 03:41.920]  Every...
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.420]  This is the problem.
[03:43.780 --> 03:47.160]  This is a problem that may be specific to me as an alcoholic.
[03:48.360 --> 03:49.080]  But every...
[03:50.020 --> 03:52.940]  Every single drink that I thought of was an alcoholic drink.
[03:53.140 --> 03:55.980]  All of my favorite drinks on earth are alcoholic.
[03:56.380 --> 03:59.420]  Even to this day, seven years sober, I'm still like, oh, well.
[03:59.920 --> 04:01.940]  You start going through gins and you're like, stop, stop.
[04:03.400 --> 04:05.880]  So I'm similarly struggled like Eric, I think.
[04:06.180 --> 04:07.760]  Yeah, I... the same thing.
[04:07.860 --> 04:10.180]  Where it was just like, I like tequila soda.
[04:10.300 --> 04:11.960]  Well, that's okay. Well, fuck.
[04:12.580 --> 04:14.540]  Margarita? Goddamn. Like, it's just like a lot of that.
[04:14.720 --> 04:16.740]  Did you also do the thing where you're like, best?
[04:16.740 --> 04:21.520]  Non-alcoholic drinks and they're like, here's the best non-alcoholic cocktail that you could have.
[04:21.660 --> 04:24.700]  Oh, yeah. It was mostly just cocktails that they wanted me to make.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.420]  And then I just went, well, this...
[04:26.420 --> 04:27.220]  I was going to do a bit.
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.740]  I was going to do a bit where I was going to go like...
[04:31.900 --> 04:32.620]  Virgin painkiller.
[04:33.280 --> 04:34.000]  Virgin daiquiri.
[04:34.740 --> 04:35.460]  Virgin margarita.
[04:35.780 --> 04:37.740]  But then I went, no, I'm going to try.
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.160]  I'm going to give it a shot and see how it goes.
[04:41.220 --> 04:43.700]  You guys are like, I got to try to put something together.
[04:43.700 --> 04:50.980]  Meanwhile, I am nervously sweating looking at my draft board trying to determine what Mountain Dew is the third best.
[04:51.040 --> 04:54.040]  Like, it is... we've had completely different experiences.
[04:54.420 --> 04:57.360]  So everyone is saying that they're not really a drinks guy.
[04:57.660 --> 04:59.180]  I only drink water.
[04:59.640 --> 05:00.740]  Yeah. I drink water.
[05:01.760 --> 05:02.880]  Well, that's gonna be a rough one.
[05:03.240 --> 05:05.060]  You better hope you're high on the draft board.
[05:08.760 --> 05:11.880]  I got news for you, buddy. Water's on my list, too.
[05:12.400 --> 05:13.600]  It's a really good drink.
[05:14.880 --> 05:16.140]  It's not on mine.
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.200]  Some would say the best.
[05:20.220 --> 05:23.120]  The first time I had a Coke was in the Gerplichug.
[05:26.100 --> 05:34.000]  Oh, man. Okay. Well, we have Aneg lined up. But how many times do we randomize? Is it 49? Because it's Jeff's birthday!
[05:35.460 --> 05:37.480]  Eric said it, not me. 49 it is.
[05:38.040 --> 05:40.480]  Most drinks have water. That's H2O. 2O is 20.
[05:41.240 --> 05:42.280]  How about 2?
[05:43.200 --> 05:50.680]  But hold on. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. H is the 8th letter. So how many times will 8 go into 20? Two times?
[05:50.980 --> 05:52.720]  Well, let's say 8 goes into 12.
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.520]  I'm pushing for 2, Nick.
[05:54.800 --> 05:57.240]  I want you to know I'm on Nick's side here.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.860]  H minus 20 is 12.
[05:59.940 --> 06:00.340]  Okay.
[06:01.460 --> 06:02.920]  How many times are we randomizing?
[06:03.200 --> 06:06.140]  I think we're doing 12. H minus 20 is 12.
[06:08.780 --> 06:09.140]  Um...
[06:09.820 --> 06:10.940]  I'm voting 2.
[06:11.940 --> 06:12.900]  It's gotta be more than 2.
[06:13.360 --> 06:16.700]  Okay, hang on. Wait. So we have two votes for 2 and two votes for 12?
[06:17.120 --> 06:21.060]  Eric, replace all the names with the numbers 1 to 10 and we'll figure out how many times...
[06:21.060 --> 06:26.520]  Wait, wait, wait. No, because we have to take a vote. We have to take a vote. So there's two votes for 2 and two votes for 12.
[06:26.700 --> 06:30.080]  And now Eric has all the power.
[06:31.440 --> 06:36.120]  Ah, we love the way this swung and that's why we're doing it 12 times!
[06:36.860 --> 06:38.580]  You can edit the video.
[06:41.220 --> 06:43.520]  I did not expect that to go my way.
[06:44.080 --> 06:44.280]  Hell yeah!
[06:44.800 --> 06:46.380]  I'll make this smaller.
[06:46.580 --> 06:47.420]  Eric's never on our side.
[06:47.420 --> 06:47.880]  Hang on.
[06:47.960 --> 06:49.300]  What good is this gonna do?
[06:49.760 --> 06:53.580]  Because now, when we randomize, this is always in the same spot.
[06:54.340 --> 06:54.760]  Oh, okay.
[06:54.800 --> 06:55.860]  You can just throw a black bar.
[06:56.120 --> 06:56.600]  Oh, God.
[06:56.600 --> 06:57.540]  Let me just use a VPN.
[07:00.060 --> 07:01.400]  First of 12!
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.620]  Gavin, Jeff, Eric, Andrew, Nick!
[07:05.480 --> 07:08.180]  Why have we done this for every fucking draft? What are we doing?
[07:08.340 --> 07:09.840]  Well, I can't even see it.
[07:09.960 --> 07:10.640]  That's why.
[07:10.840 --> 07:12.400]  We're iterating. We're learning.
[07:12.520 --> 07:14.700]  Gavin, Jeff, Andrew, Nick, Eric.
[07:14.960 --> 07:15.720]  What the fuck?
[07:17.220 --> 07:17.660]  Gavin!
[07:17.920 --> 07:18.740]  What the fuck?
[07:19.340 --> 07:20.320]  Get out of here, Gavin.
[07:20.480 --> 07:22.120]  Andrew, Nick, Jeff, Eric.
[07:22.420 --> 07:23.020]  Number 4!
[07:23.500 --> 07:25.420]  Nick, Jeff, Gavin, Eric, Andrew.
[07:27.440 --> 07:27.880]  5...
[07:27.880 --> 07:32.460]  Oh, number 1. I want one so bad. It's the most I've ever wanted one.
[07:32.460 --> 07:34.660]  Here's 6, Jeff at the top.
[07:34.800 --> 07:36.260]  I need one. I need it.
[07:36.420 --> 07:37.920]  7, Nick at the top.
[07:38.140 --> 07:38.640]  I need to beat Eric.
[07:38.820 --> 07:40.680]  8, Eric at the top.
[07:40.780 --> 07:41.060]  Uh-oh.
[07:41.780 --> 07:43.480]  9, Nick at the top.
[07:44.620 --> 07:46.460]  10, Jeff at the top.
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.400]  11 is Andrew, Gavin, Nick, Jeff, Eric.
[07:51.420 --> 07:53.620]  And now, number 12!
[07:54.140 --> 07:56.120]  Come on! Come on!
[07:56.620 --> 07:58.900]  Gavin, Andrew, Nick, Eric, Jeff.
[07:59.020 --> 07:59.280]  No!
[07:59.280 --> 07:59.440]  No!
[07:59.980 --> 08:02.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[08:02.820 --> 08:05.880]  God damn. I'm gonna lose two of my picks in the first one.
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.340]  Oh, man.
[08:13.860 --> 08:19.980]  Fellas, we randomized 12 times and now it's time for the best non-alcoholic drink draft to begin.
[08:20.140 --> 08:23.380]  Gavin, first pick here.
[08:23.700 --> 08:28.660]  How about for the prize of this, winner gets whatever their first pick is.
[08:28.840 --> 08:30.080]  Whatever their first round pick is.
[08:30.080 --> 08:30.780]  Ooh.
[08:31.260 --> 08:31.780]  Interesting.
[08:32.240 --> 08:32.660]  Love it.
[08:33.320 --> 08:35.160]  On the house, on the company.
[08:35.540 --> 08:36.260]  On the company.
[08:36.900 --> 08:37.040]  Okay.
[08:37.160 --> 08:42.860]  I would also like to say I'm willing to sell my slot in this draft for 25 bucks.
[08:43.460 --> 08:43.980]  Jeff?
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.240]  I don't want to pay $25 for his...
[08:49.240 --> 08:51.420]  Hold on, what number is he in the slot?
[08:51.940 --> 08:52.540]  He's number one?
[08:53.180 --> 08:53.360]  Yeah.
[08:54.040 --> 08:56.920]  So, you know, Apple Pay, cash, and it's all yours.
[08:58.140 --> 08:58.980]  Don't do it, Jeff.
[08:59.040 --> 08:59.520]  It's your birthday.
[09:00.460 --> 09:01.620]  Do you have Venmo?
[09:02.060 --> 09:02.940]  Jeff, don't do it.
[09:03.400 --> 09:03.960]  Got Venmo?
[09:04.560 --> 09:04.820]  No!
[09:08.440 --> 09:09.880]  No, no, no.
[09:10.080 --> 09:10.540]  Wow.
[09:11.480 --> 09:12.300]  My first pick.
[09:14.080 --> 09:16.360]  It's a very nice liquid.
[09:17.560 --> 09:18.400]  You're fucked.
[09:18.500 --> 09:19.840]  You have nothing for two through four.
[09:20.760 --> 09:26.020]  This is a very nice liquid that I'd never tried until I met a Jeffrey Ramsey.
[09:26.020 --> 09:28.820]  And that liquid is coffee.
[09:29.100 --> 09:31.420]  Oh, shit.
[09:31.840 --> 09:32.900]  Eat shit, Eric!
[09:33.980 --> 09:34.720]  We suck.
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.860]  Well, we're both fucks. I could have got coffee.
[09:37.480 --> 09:40.000]  I really wanted coffee. I thought you were going to go water.
[09:40.320 --> 09:42.180]  I thought it would be so funny if I picked coffee.
[09:44.140 --> 09:44.900]  Oh, man.
[09:45.060 --> 09:45.460]  Fuck you.
[09:45.580 --> 09:46.400]  That really threw me.
[09:46.720 --> 09:47.460]  Have it every morning?
[09:47.740 --> 09:50.100]  Thanks to Eric, I'm trying it in the afternoons as well.
[09:50.220 --> 09:51.400]  Oh, how's that been going for you?
[09:51.880 --> 09:53.520]  Pretty good. Not keeping me up?
[09:53.520 --> 09:55.580]  Yeah, right. It's a nice little pick-me-up.
[09:55.680 --> 09:57.700]  It's not doing too much. You can also just add a little bit of water.
[09:57.840 --> 10:00.120]  Like, make it a little weaker. Have a little water. Half-caffeine. You're good.
[10:00.260 --> 10:04.280]  And if I make my morning coffee late enough, I just have the dregs of that in the afternoon.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.280]  Oh, that sounds awful.
[10:07.500 --> 10:08.220]  It's not great.
[10:10.700 --> 10:11.060]  Yum.
[10:12.320 --> 10:13.540]  Andrew, your first pick.
[10:13.820 --> 10:17.180]  I'm going to go with the number one soda in the world. I'm going Coca-Cola.
[10:17.640 --> 10:20.640]  It is classic. Love it as a summer drink.
[10:20.860 --> 10:22.200]  Love it as a slurpee.
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.560]  You can go all sorts of ways with Coke.
[10:25.060 --> 10:26.340]  Number one brand leader.
[10:26.560 --> 10:29.160]  I think, hands down, best drink.
[10:29.800 --> 10:30.060]  Okay.
[10:30.620 --> 10:31.500]  Very good pick.
[10:32.320 --> 10:32.840]  Nick.
[10:33.780 --> 10:36.840]  Alright, so this is as close as you can get to drip coffee.
[10:37.280 --> 10:39.580]  And still consider it to be that.
[10:39.660 --> 10:44.600]  It's an Americano, which is basically like a shot of espresso, but filled with water to make up the difference.
[10:44.920 --> 10:45.320]  So it's...
[10:45.320 --> 10:46.240]  I feel like that's coffee.
[10:48.520 --> 10:50.200]  I'll let you guys argue about it.
[10:50.280 --> 10:52.000]  After the hash brown thing?
[10:52.520 --> 10:52.680]  Yeah.
[10:54.420 --> 10:55.940]  I'm queued. You're shredded.
[10:56.060 --> 10:57.520]  No, I'm shredded. You're queued. Hold on.
[10:58.580 --> 10:59.140]  It doesn't matter.
[10:59.200 --> 11:03.100]  I was going to say that I feel like it's coffee, but I don't know anything about coffee.
[11:03.260 --> 11:07.040]  So would Diet Coke be acceptable as Eric's pick if Andrew's picked Coke?
[11:07.240 --> 11:08.220]  Yeah, it's not the same thing.
[11:08.320 --> 11:08.400]  I would think so.
[11:08.780 --> 11:09.880]  Totally different product.
[11:10.600 --> 11:11.840]  They're different products entirely.
[11:12.060 --> 11:14.540]  Different flavor, different product entirely.
[11:14.540 --> 11:17.520]  Completely different, but close, but different.
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.580]  It's going to kill you in a totally different way.
[11:19.800 --> 11:20.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:21.620 --> 11:22.500]  So Americano.
[11:22.560 --> 11:25.400]  Well, Gavin already knew what my pick was.
[11:26.420 --> 11:27.160]  Diet Coke it is.
[11:32.400 --> 11:33.280]  I feel...
[11:33.280 --> 11:34.000]  What?
[11:35.100 --> 11:35.600]  What do you mean?
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.480]  We got coffee, Coke, coffee, and Coke.
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.700]  What an excellent first round.
[11:42.160 --> 11:45.180]  Listen, you're not a beverages guy. There's a wild difference.
[11:45.180 --> 11:46.300]  I love Coca-Cola.
[11:46.620 --> 11:48.640]  I spit in the face of Diet Coke.
[11:48.840 --> 11:50.080]  I don't like Diet Coke.
[11:50.580 --> 11:51.140]  I'm with you.
[11:51.180 --> 11:53.480]  I don't like Diet Coke at all.
[11:53.780 --> 11:56.300]  And I would never drink a Coke to save my life.
[11:56.420 --> 11:57.300]  I'd much rather have a Diet Coke.
[11:57.400 --> 11:59.420]  Oh, yeah, I think Diet Coke sucks.
[11:59.580 --> 12:00.500]  I don't like it at all.
[12:00.520 --> 12:01.860]  Did you do that to spite Jeff?
[12:01.960 --> 12:02.600]  What are you doing?
[12:03.440 --> 12:06.680]  I'm trying to make the best, the strongest list in the world, bud.
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.840]  He's here to win the Super Bowl.
[12:08.980 --> 12:11.000]  He doesn't necessarily have to like the pick.
[12:11.080 --> 12:12.700]  He's trying to build a winning team.
[12:12.700 --> 12:14.660]  So it's my turn.
[12:15.980 --> 12:19.800]  And here's where I was gonna go with it, and now I'm not.
[12:19.960 --> 12:24.920]  I was gonna try to get coffee, iced coffee, cold brew, and iced turbo,
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.820]  because I consider them all four to be different things.
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.020]  But since that's blown, and we're already doing the Americano stuff,
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.620]  I'm gonna leave coffee alone.
[12:32.980 --> 12:33.400]  Okay.
[12:33.780 --> 12:41.140]  I'm gonna go with my current favorite sody in the world, which is Diet Starry.
[12:42.220 --> 12:44.000]  Wow, that's your favorite one right now?
[12:44.260 --> 12:45.220]  I like Starry right now.
[12:45.300 --> 12:46.740]  I like the little lemon-lime dudes.
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.160]  I like how the lemon guy wears a lime costume,
[12:49.300 --> 12:50.940]  and the lime guy wears a lemon costume.
[12:51.020 --> 12:52.320]  It fucks with my head a little bit.
[12:52.600 --> 12:55.840]  And I love the story behind it, if you don't know about Starry.
[12:56.140 --> 12:59.780]  They just showed up one day, advertising in NBA games.
[13:00.540 --> 13:01.600]  A brand came out of nowhere.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.360]  What happened is Pepsi, PepsiCo, they had Sierra Mist,
[13:06.860 --> 13:09.520]  and then there was some fucking influencer lady named Sierra Mist,
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.480]  and they tried to sue her, to have her stop using the name,
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.540]  but she had the name first.
[13:14.880 --> 13:17.040]  So what ended up happening was they fucked themselves,
[13:17.160 --> 13:20.500]  and lost access to their own name, and so they had to return to Starry.
[13:20.680 --> 13:21.860]  Oh, that's what happened?
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.740]  That's why Starry exists.
[13:23.860 --> 13:25.460]  It's just Sierra Mist with a different name.
[13:26.000 --> 13:26.720]  I had no idea.
[13:26.920 --> 13:27.280]  Wow.
[13:27.360 --> 13:28.580]  I had no idea about that either.
[13:29.200 --> 13:32.080]  I wondered if it was a different recipe, and I feel like you answered that.
[13:32.120 --> 13:33.800]  It is the exact same, it sounds like.
[13:34.380 --> 13:35.820]  I think it's the exact same.
[13:36.540 --> 13:39.020]  Hit pause on whatever you're listening to,
[13:39.280 --> 13:41.020]  and hit play on your next adventure.
[13:41.560 --> 13:44.180]  Stay two nights and get a $50 Best Western gift card.

[13:51.040 --> 13:54.260]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[13:54.600 --> 13:55.740]  especially these days.
[13:56.220 --> 13:58.780]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity,
[13:59.320 --> 14:02.760]  plus it's heated, and it just feels so good.
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.680]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[14:07.020 --> 14:08.300]  but when it can come with a car,
[14:10.140 --> 14:11.920]  suddenly it seems quite practical.
[14:12.280 --> 14:15.040]  The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[14:15.380 --> 14:18.640]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats,
[14:19.040 --> 14:20.760]  it only feels extravagant.
[14:20.780 --> 14:23.980]  And now I'm going to pick something that nobody is going to pick.
[14:24.080 --> 14:26.140]  I'm going to put a picture of it, because I get to go back to back.
[14:26.340 --> 14:27.160]  This is a weird one.
[14:27.300 --> 14:28.960]  I promise you I'm not being a dickhead.
[14:29.320 --> 14:31.160]  This is something that I genuinely liked.
[14:32.700 --> 14:33.220]  Vimto.
[14:33.380 --> 14:34.400]  What is that?
[14:35.460 --> 14:37.460]  It just ravaged my list.
[14:39.820 --> 14:42.820]  I didn't expect for a second to lose Vimto.
[14:43.780 --> 14:44.780]  Are you shitting me?
[14:45.760 --> 14:46.980]  Are you serious?
[14:48.020 --> 14:48.480]  Yeah.
[14:49.120 --> 14:50.520]  I love Vimto, man.
[14:51.660 --> 14:54.960]  It's like a fruit juice I used to drink in Kuwait all the time.
[14:55.080 --> 14:56.220]  They would always give it to us as a gift.
[14:56.820 --> 14:58.040]  God damn it.
[14:58.860 --> 14:59.620]  That's funny.
[15:00.060 --> 15:01.720]  I've never heard of Vimto.
[15:02.220 --> 15:06.040]  One time I dropped a bottle of Vimto in front of my door at the barracks in Kuwait,
[15:06.140 --> 15:09.840]  and I just left it, and they sent the MPs because they thought it was a blood trail.
[15:10.300 --> 15:11.560]  Oh my god.
[15:12.580 --> 15:13.660]  Oh my god.
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.140]  I had to explain some shit.
[15:15.860 --> 15:21.060]  Vimto is a British mixed fruit soft drink containing the juice of grapes,
[15:21.880 --> 15:23.680]  raspberries, and black currants,
[15:24.620 --> 15:25.840]  flavored with herbs and spices.
[15:25.940 --> 15:26.720]  What does it taste like?
[15:26.720 --> 15:31.220]  It says here on Google it's over 100 years old and has an indescribable flavor.
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.520]  Yeah, indescribable.
[15:32.820 --> 15:35.540]  It's like a syrupy, dark fruit juice.
[15:35.660 --> 15:36.360]  I don't know how to describe it.
[15:37.180 --> 15:39.820]  It's like in the same world as grape juice, but very different.
[15:40.440 --> 15:40.800]  Huh.
[15:41.920 --> 15:42.280]  Interesting.
[15:42.960 --> 15:43.320]  Vimto.
[15:43.420 --> 15:44.580]  I like that you fucked up Gavin.
[15:44.820 --> 15:45.060]  That's funny.
[15:45.240 --> 15:46.320]  I really didn't mean to.
[15:46.420 --> 15:50.200]  I didn't think anybody would have heard of it, to be honest.
[15:50.240 --> 15:50.840]  That's what I thought.
[15:53.900 --> 15:55.100]  Um, okay.
[15:55.580 --> 15:57.820]  My second pick, my first pick, Diet Coke.
[15:58.700 --> 15:59.580]  What a delicious soda.
[16:00.680 --> 16:04.340]  My second pick, I drink black coffee.
[16:04.580 --> 16:07.720]  That is the only really form of coffee that I'll have.
[16:07.800 --> 16:09.440]  I'll have iced coffee, but usually it's just black.
[16:09.900 --> 16:15.760]  Except one time of year where I am a slut for a pumpkin spice latte.
[16:16.220 --> 16:19.740]  I love a pumpkin spice latte.
[16:20.180 --> 16:21.320]  This is bullshit.
[16:21.620 --> 16:22.140]  I fucking love it.
[16:22.220 --> 16:23.340]  I love it.
[16:23.620 --> 16:27.020]  And it's so good and different from regular coffee.
[16:27.740 --> 16:29.600]  This is the shittiest draft we've ever done.
[16:30.160 --> 16:30.920]  Wow, what's wrong?
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.520]  Guys, I took coffee.
[16:33.100 --> 16:33.560]  That's not coffee.
[16:33.560 --> 16:34.560]  No, he took Vimto.
[16:34.740 --> 16:36.460]  You took coffee and then my thing's different.
[16:36.540 --> 16:37.840]  It doesn't say coffee anywhere on there.
[16:38.020 --> 16:38.560]  That's not coffee.
[16:38.620 --> 16:39.120]  This is pumpkin spice latte.
[16:39.560 --> 16:45.060]  If I went up to Starbucks and I said, give me a coffee, and they handed me a pumpkin spice latte, it's different things, bud.
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.140]  The problem, Gavin, is that I don't know enough about coffee to be on your side.
[16:49.140 --> 16:50.260]  I don't know what a latte is.
[16:50.320 --> 16:50.860]  I have no clue.
[16:51.040 --> 16:52.520]  It's made with fucking coffee beans.
[16:52.820 --> 16:55.360]  I think I'm on your side, but I just don't know.
[16:56.320 --> 16:57.100]  Geoff, thoughts?
[16:57.480 --> 17:05.760]  I think a pumpkin spice latte is not as offensive as a choice as Americano was.
[17:06.200 --> 17:06.480]  I agree.
[17:07.120 --> 17:08.100]  I think it's less controversial.
[17:08.320 --> 17:08.640]  It is further.
[17:08.640 --> 17:13.820]  See, what I've done by picking coffee, though, compared to everyone else is now I can't put like a cappuccino because I've already put coffee.
[17:14.880 --> 17:16.400]  Yeah, you can put cappuccino if you want.
[17:16.700 --> 17:17.240]  They're different.
[17:18.120 --> 17:19.100]  I'm sorry, Gavin.
[17:19.180 --> 17:20.240]  You just said it's a different name.
[17:20.300 --> 17:22.140]  You said I can't put cappuccino, but you can.
[17:22.200 --> 17:24.420]  But I've wasted... I could have put that instead of coffee.
[17:25.160 --> 17:26.220]  I mean, you could have, but you didn't.
[17:26.220 --> 17:27.000]  I guess you should have done that.
[17:27.120 --> 17:29.420]  It just seemed weird that you picked coffee when you could just...
[17:29.420 --> 17:31.600]  Yeah, weird. I didn't think other people would also be picking coffee.
[17:31.760 --> 17:32.780]  Weird. Hmm. Weird.
[17:33.200 --> 17:33.760]  Well, we didn't.
[17:34.700 --> 17:34.920]  Okay.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.160]  Yeah, we picked pumpkin spice latte.
[17:36.520 --> 17:36.780]  Yeah.
[17:37.240 --> 17:41.540]  I'm going to watch you making an Americano and a pumpkin spice latte without using coffee.
[17:41.820 --> 17:42.380]  Let's see how that goes.
[17:42.440 --> 17:45.040]  Well, I'm going to watch you make any drink without water, asshole.
[17:45.040 --> 17:47.940]  You have a drink to learn.
[17:49.480 --> 17:50.040]  That's fair.
[17:50.240 --> 17:50.680]  That's fair.
[17:52.060 --> 17:53.180]  Nick, second pick.
[17:53.940 --> 17:55.280]  I'm so pissed at you.
[17:55.400 --> 17:59.720]  I was going to say a basic bitch my way through all of October with the pumpkin spice latte.
[18:00.060 --> 18:01.360]  I was saving that for this.
[18:01.460 --> 18:02.000]  But you know what?
[18:02.480 --> 18:03.180]  It's just to keep rolling.
[18:03.900 --> 18:03.980]  Huh?
[18:04.860 --> 18:07.040]  I'm going to go with a wonderful...
[18:07.920 --> 18:11.700]  It's a variation of an Earl Grey tea spiced with vanilla and honey.
[18:11.780 --> 18:12.840]  It's called a London Fog.
[18:13.040 --> 18:14.600]  I like to get it with a shot of espresso.
[18:15.620 --> 18:16.660]  Wait, what?
[18:16.940 --> 18:18.460]  You get a London Fog with espresso?
[18:19.100 --> 18:19.360]  Yeah.
[18:23.800 --> 18:25.540]  You must be buzzing after that.
[18:25.780 --> 18:29.460]  You just fucking flying or what?
[18:29.700 --> 18:30.960]  London Fog doesn't have that much.
[18:32.240 --> 18:33.800]  Yeah, it's good.
[18:34.420 --> 18:36.620]  Tune in for my next pick, an Arnold Palmer with coffee.
[18:41.140 --> 18:42.820]  And this bullshit draft.
[18:42.820 --> 18:43.280]  What?
[18:45.880 --> 18:47.540]  I'm so sorry, Gavin.
[18:50.380 --> 18:51.540]  Oh, man.
[18:52.320 --> 18:54.020]  Well, that might be refreshing, actually.
[18:54.700 --> 18:54.940]  Yeah.
[18:55.280 --> 18:57.380]  Hey, Andrew, you have your second pick.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.520]  I mean, what's the worst that could happen when you're having a draft?
[19:02.320 --> 19:04.260]  Going with Dr. Pepper.
[19:05.020 --> 19:06.800]  Oh, what a lead-in.
[19:07.540 --> 19:10.140]  It's the new number two soda.
[19:10.360 --> 19:10.720]  Yeah.
[19:10.720 --> 19:12.540]  Took over Pepsi recently.
[19:13.400 --> 19:14.580]  I like it.
[19:14.700 --> 19:19.820]  The thing about Dr. Pepper, which is nice, unlike coffee, there isn't really a number two.
[19:20.200 --> 19:21.540]  There isn't like a close second.
[19:21.720 --> 19:22.940]  It is its own flavor.
[19:23.280 --> 19:24.380]  Hard to duplicate.
[19:24.620 --> 19:28.760]  There are other brilliant brands that try, but I feel like there is a large gap.
[19:29.300 --> 19:30.140]  You like a Pibb?
[19:30.220 --> 19:34.280]  Yeah, I think there's a large quality gap between a Pibb to a Dr. Pepper.
[19:34.760 --> 19:35.840]  I'm going Dr. Pepper.
[19:36.320 --> 19:38.360]  You think Dr. Pepper is better than Mr. Pibb?
[19:38.380 --> 19:39.200]  Way better.
[19:39.960 --> 19:41.580]  Completely different league better.
[19:42.360 --> 19:42.880]  Interesting.
[19:43.380 --> 19:45.200]  So if I wanted to, could I pick Mr. Pibb?
[19:45.940 --> 19:46.800]  You could, absolutely.
[19:47.220 --> 19:48.060]  I'm just checking.
[19:48.320 --> 19:48.840]  Different drink.
[19:49.500 --> 19:51.000]  Yeah, I think it's a totally different drink.
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.040]  Oh, like coffee and pumpkin spice latte.
[19:53.160 --> 19:54.240]  Gavin, your second pick.
[19:55.740 --> 19:57.520]  Yeah, other good liquids.
[19:57.680 --> 19:59.260]  I like liquids that are hot.
[19:59.620 --> 20:02.660]  And I like them with essence of meat.
[20:02.900 --> 20:03.820]  It's Bovril.
[20:04.160 --> 20:04.620]  No!
[20:05.460 --> 20:06.860]  A hot Bovril.
[20:07.220 --> 20:08.080]  What a drink.
[20:08.080 --> 20:10.280]  This is one of the worst drinks I've ever had.
[20:10.580 --> 20:11.280]  Hands down.
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.200]  I had a feeling that it would rear its ugly, beefy head.
[20:18.760 --> 20:21.760]  Human sandwich guy picking beef juice.
[20:22.180 --> 20:22.860]  I'm not shocked.
[20:25.180 --> 20:31.360]  Well, Gavin, after your gross Bovril pick, you actually get another pick in this snake draft.
[20:31.660 --> 20:33.040]  So, what's after Bovril?
[20:33.120 --> 20:36.280]  I would have actually accepted Bovril as best breakfast foods as well.
[20:37.440 --> 20:39.180]  See, that's the great thing about Bovril.
[20:39.900 --> 20:41.560]  I'll put a picture on my next one.
[20:41.980 --> 20:42.200]  Okay.
[20:43.040 --> 20:46.260]  Lovely. This is maybe one of...
[20:46.260 --> 20:51.740]  This might have been the first fizzy drink I ever tried, which probably put me off them for the rest of my life.
[20:52.360 --> 20:54.580]  It's a nice can of Lilt.
[20:55.480 --> 20:56.520]  What is Lilt?
[20:58.180 --> 20:59.840]  Pineapple and grapefruit Lilt.
[20:59.920 --> 21:01.260]  Get a bit of Lilt down ya.
[21:02.820 --> 21:06.220]  I don't like when you... You got more British when you said it.
[21:06.220 --> 21:07.720]  Like, it was like a lot.
[21:08.040 --> 21:10.720]  So you didn't like the Lilt? Is that what you're saying?
[21:11.880 --> 21:15.160]  As a kid, I didn't like anything fizzy, but I think the flavor was fine.
[21:15.780 --> 21:21.900]  I think I found like a stale, still can of Lilt pretty good.
[21:22.940 --> 21:25.700]  But I think they got rid of it eventually.
[21:26.520 --> 21:32.640]  What a trajectory your life has been of hating anything fizzy to becoming a SodaStream guy.
[21:33.340 --> 21:33.940]  Wow.
[21:35.680 --> 21:36.900]  You're adding fizz now.
[21:37.500 --> 21:45.340]  It says right here that Lilt was discontinued in the early 2000s because it caused extreme stupidity in British boys.
[21:46.880 --> 21:53.420]  Yeah, Lilt fizzy drink scrapped by Coca-Cola after 50 years. 1974 to 2023.
[21:54.440 --> 21:55.300]  Man, rip Lilt.
[21:56.040 --> 21:56.600]  Good run.
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.300]  Had some great adverts.
[21:58.840 --> 21:59.680]  Rip Lilt's a cool name.
[22:02.080 --> 22:03.100]  I'm with you though.
[22:03.180 --> 22:05.640]  When I was a kid, I did not like fizzy drinks at all.
[22:05.660 --> 22:08.040]  I didn't drink soda at all. None of it.
[22:08.440 --> 22:09.460]  Just not for me.
[22:10.240 --> 22:10.460]  Interesting.
[22:12.220 --> 22:13.760]  But Andrew, you get your third pick.
[22:13.840 --> 22:15.140]  So far you have Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper.
[22:15.340 --> 22:17.660]  What do you have as your third pick on the list?
[22:20.500 --> 22:22.160]  This has completely thrown me.
[22:22.200 --> 22:25.440]  I did not expect Lilt to be on the board in the third round.
[22:27.500 --> 22:28.580]  What do I want to pick?
[22:28.580 --> 22:32.120]  You say that like you just, like, Gavin stole your Lilt.
[22:32.520 --> 22:34.640]  No, I just, it's...
[22:34.640 --> 22:36.060]  I didn't...
[22:36.060 --> 22:38.200]  This board is crazy compared to what I had.
[22:38.360 --> 22:40.400]  I'm just processing. I'm looking at my own field.
[22:40.880 --> 22:43.260]  Has any board ever gone the way you thought it would?
[22:43.740 --> 22:44.080]  Never.
[22:44.800 --> 22:45.840]  The TV one.
[22:46.300 --> 22:47.860]  I had a lot of picks taken in that one.
[22:49.880 --> 22:51.520]  I'm going to go with...
[22:51.520 --> 22:54.180]  I don't think there's necessarily a wrong answer to this.
[22:55.480 --> 22:57.260]  But, classic Mountain Dew flavor.
[22:57.640 --> 22:58.700]  Mountain Dew Code Red.
[23:01.460 --> 23:03.000]  Love a Code Red.
[23:03.400 --> 23:05.140]  It's the only acceptable Mountain Dew.
[23:05.500 --> 23:05.900]  I agree.
[23:06.080 --> 23:06.420]  Really?
[23:07.000 --> 23:07.880]  I can't drink Mountain Dew.
[23:08.460 --> 23:10.120]  I like a Baja Blast.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.840]  Oh, Baja Blast, okay.
[23:12.660 --> 23:13.900]  I like quite a few of them.
[23:14.460 --> 23:16.300]  But I had to go with Code Red.
[23:16.480 --> 23:17.340]  It was a tough decision.
[23:18.220 --> 23:20.200]  There's a lot of good choices for Mountain Dew.
[23:20.560 --> 23:21.980]  I wish I had a fun fact about it.
[23:21.980 --> 23:24.700]  I don't believe Coke killed it, is my fun fact.
[23:25.180 --> 23:26.020]  I'm like Lilt.
[23:29.880 --> 23:31.740]  Mountain Dew fun facts.
[23:31.880 --> 23:35.220]  11 energizing facts about Mountain Dew.
[23:36.240 --> 23:39.200]  Did you know that the Great Depression made Mountain Dew possible?
[23:40.360 --> 23:41.480]  Hell yeah, Code Red.
[23:41.760 --> 23:43.200]  That's what they refer to it as.
[23:45.160 --> 23:46.260]  They wanted to be...
[23:46.260 --> 23:49.260]  The dudes that made it wanted to be orange soda moguls.
[23:49.520 --> 23:53.500]  But they were part of a group that began bottling orange crush in 1926.
[23:54.180 --> 23:58.040]  But then the Depression hit them particularly hard.
[23:58.160 --> 24:00.440]  So they went bankrupt and had to pivot.
[24:00.740 --> 24:01.080]  Interesting.
[24:01.560 --> 24:01.680]  Huh.
[24:03.060 --> 24:06.720]  Isn't Mountain Dew made to be put with whiskey?
[24:06.940 --> 24:07.680]  Is that what it was for?
[24:07.760 --> 24:08.940]  I think it was made for...
[24:08.940 --> 24:11.980]  It was like hillbilly syrup, right?
[24:11.980 --> 24:13.920]  Yeah, I was gonna say.
[24:14.600 --> 24:16.800]  Yesterday I was in my orange factory.
[24:17.160 --> 24:19.900]  Today I'm making dew in the fucking mountains.
[24:20.420 --> 24:21.520]  Life's terrible.
[24:25.010 --> 24:26.950]  Pepsi eventually retired the hillbilly.
[24:27.390 --> 24:28.430]  They were the mascots.
[24:29.010 --> 24:29.490]  Awesome.
[24:29.810 --> 24:31.090]  R.I.P. Hillbilly.
[24:31.770 --> 24:36.970]  Can we do like a soda graveyard of Lilt and the hillbilly from Mountain Dew?
[24:37.310 --> 24:38.890]  Like cancelled fruit drinks.
[24:39.730 --> 24:40.230]  I mean sodas.
[24:40.250 --> 24:42.050]  Just cancelled soda people.
[24:42.750 --> 24:44.670]  Should we create a soda cemetery?
[24:44.970 --> 24:46.050]  I like this idea.
[24:47.210 --> 24:48.250]  Anyway, I had an idea.
[24:48.350 --> 24:49.750]  I was telling Andrew earlier today.
[24:49.770 --> 24:51.270]  I had an idea for a graveyard game.
[24:51.590 --> 24:53.070]  Like we play cemetery bingo.
[24:53.930 --> 24:59.030]  And maybe we should start making virtual cemeteries for stuff like this.
[24:59.210 --> 24:59.870]  It'd be fun.
[24:59.950 --> 25:00.430]  Good idea.
[25:00.990 --> 25:02.010]  Not a bad one.
[25:04.470 --> 25:06.250]  Nick, you have the third pick here.
[25:07.690 --> 25:08.750]  Well, it is the summer.
[25:09.890 --> 25:12.930]  And there are certain drinks that stick out to us, I think.
[25:14.090 --> 25:15.890]  When you're hot and you come in from like...
[25:16.270 --> 25:17.770]  Let's say Mowen, you're blonde.
[25:18.750 --> 25:20.710]  This motherfucker's about to pick an iced coffee.
[25:21.510 --> 25:22.210]  No, no.
[25:22.490 --> 25:22.930]  Definitely not.
[25:23.010 --> 25:24.170]  I want to live, Andrew.
[25:24.310 --> 25:26.350]  I'm not picking an iced coffee in this instance.
[25:26.770 --> 25:30.150]  So you come in and you pour yourself a nice glass of lemonade.
[25:30.710 --> 25:34.110]  Or, you know, you're driving down the street and you see some kids at a stand.
[25:34.190 --> 25:34.870]  And you're like, you know what?
[25:35.130 --> 25:36.890]  I have two dollars cash.
[25:36.990 --> 25:37.670]  Here you go, kids.
[25:37.670 --> 25:38.890]  I'll take some of that.
[25:39.070 --> 25:39.570]  Is that a real thing?
[25:40.150 --> 25:40.290]  Yeah.
[25:40.550 --> 25:40.910]  Yeah.
[25:41.510 --> 25:42.150]  Lemonade stands?
[25:42.450 --> 25:42.550]  Yeah.
[25:42.710 --> 25:42.890]  Yeah.
[25:43.430 --> 25:44.390]  Do they not exist in England?
[25:44.950 --> 25:45.390]  I don't know.
[25:45.430 --> 25:46.030]  I've never seen one.
[25:46.370 --> 25:53.690]  I would go so far as to say almost every kid in America has had a lemonade stand at one
[25:53.690 --> 25:54.410]  point in their life.
[25:54.510 --> 25:54.830]  Absolutely.
[25:55.610 --> 25:57.250]  I've had multiple as a kid.
[25:57.250 --> 25:57.570]  Me too.
[25:58.210 --> 25:59.910]  We should all go out and see who can make the most money.
[26:02.310 --> 26:05.530]  We should just have a lemonade stand, all of us together, and see how it goes.
[26:06.570 --> 26:07.870]  That'd be a great supplement.
[26:07.910 --> 26:08.870]  That'd be a bunch of fun.
[26:09.870 --> 26:11.350]  Man, that's insane.
[26:11.950 --> 26:14.230]  What a fantastic idea for a supplement.
[26:14.550 --> 26:15.170]  I think we should do that.
[26:15.170 --> 26:16.170]  Try to, like, push kids off the bus.
[26:16.570 --> 26:17.730]  Regulation Lemonade!
[26:17.890 --> 26:18.950]  Oh, that's amazing.
[26:19.130 --> 26:19.970]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[26:19.970 --> 26:20.670]  It's like the wire.
[26:21.890 --> 26:22.690]  This is my corner.
[26:22.690 --> 26:23.090]  Mikey Lemonade?
[26:23.530 --> 26:25.570]  Guys, there's always money in the lemonade stand.
[26:26.090 --> 26:26.430]  That's true.
[26:26.650 --> 26:26.950]  Oh my God.
[26:28.390 --> 26:29.790]  I really want this now.
[26:29.990 --> 26:30.990]  That would be hilarious.
[26:31.930 --> 26:33.310]  I've got the next pick here.
[26:33.310 --> 26:36.830]  After Diet Coke and Pumpkin Spice Latte, I'm going to cool down.
[26:36.910 --> 26:37.690]  I don't know if you guys know this.
[26:37.770 --> 26:44.910]  I'm from Southern California, and my drink of choice at the taco shop, the horchata.
[26:46.210 --> 26:47.250]  What's a horchata?
[26:47.490 --> 26:48.670]  It's probably too white for Jeff.
[26:50.270 --> 26:56.830]  It's like a rice milk with, like, a cinnamon sweet kind of flavor to it.
[26:57.010 --> 26:58.690]  It is so good.
[26:58.910 --> 27:00.650]  It's so fucking good.
[27:00.750 --> 27:01.590]  I love a horchata.
[27:01.730 --> 27:03.110]  Like, an ice cold horchata.
[27:03.110 --> 27:07.010]  When you get, like, a burrito, when you're done skateboarding with your dumbass friends,
[27:07.130 --> 27:11.650]  and you all split money for a burrito, and then everyone gets a horchata, it rocks.
[27:11.830 --> 27:13.270]  It is such a good drink.
[27:13.610 --> 27:13.910]  I love it.
[27:15.310 --> 27:16.070]  I recommend it.
[27:16.310 --> 27:16.730]  I recommend it.
[27:16.770 --> 27:17.210]  You should find it.
[27:17.270 --> 27:17.650]  Try it, Andrew.
[27:17.710 --> 27:18.130]  I think you'd like it.
[27:18.150 --> 27:19.250]  It looks officially very appealing.
[27:19.930 --> 27:20.150]  Mm-hmm.
[27:20.390 --> 27:21.750]  It looks like it's milk.
[27:21.750 --> 27:23.510]  It's not like milk milk.
[27:23.650 --> 27:24.810]  It's not like...
[27:24.810 --> 27:27.930]  It's like rice milk, so it just looks sort of opaque, but it's very good.
[27:27.930 --> 27:30.030]  You're not a fan of this, Jeff, because it's white, I'm assuming?
[27:30.090 --> 27:30.310]  Mm-hmm.
[27:30.410 --> 27:31.190]  Yeah, I've tried it.
[27:31.190 --> 27:31.770]  I've had...
[27:31.770 --> 27:32.550]  Horchata's not my thing.
[27:33.310 --> 27:33.790]  Mm-hmm.
[27:34.070 --> 27:35.010]  But I understand...
[27:35.010 --> 27:35.030]  Understandable.
[27:35.030 --> 27:36.770]  It's very popular around here.
[27:36.950 --> 27:37.470]  People love it.
[27:37.470 --> 27:37.650]  Okay.
[27:37.670 --> 27:38.090]  I just...
[27:38.090 --> 27:38.370]  It's not for me.
[27:40.070 --> 27:43.950]  But, Jeff, you get your last two picks here, after your diet star in Vimto.
[27:44.350 --> 27:45.090]  Oh, boy!
[27:45.150 --> 27:45.770]  Let's see.
[27:45.870 --> 27:46.850]  What am I gonna pick?
[27:46.930 --> 27:48.610]  Let's go to the master list.
[27:49.850 --> 27:50.210]  Okay.
[27:50.510 --> 27:52.150]  For my third pick, I'm going to pick...
[27:52.150 --> 27:52.670]  This is specific.
[27:52.670 --> 27:59.090]  I'm going to pick a Route 44 diet cherry limeade.
[27:59.710 --> 28:00.090]  Ooh!
[28:00.450 --> 28:00.790]  Ooh!
[28:00.930 --> 28:01.230]  From Sonic.
[28:02.090 --> 28:02.470]  Uh...
[28:02.470 --> 28:02.690]  Oh!
[28:02.690 --> 28:03.910]  Got some on the wall outside.
[28:04.150 --> 28:04.530]  Gavin...
[28:04.530 --> 28:07.510]  I watched Gavin throw one one time across his yard.
[28:07.990 --> 28:08.330]  What?
[28:08.970 --> 28:09.350]  What?
[28:10.790 --> 28:12.090]  We covered this on the show.
[28:12.350 --> 28:12.510]  Yeah.
[28:12.630 --> 28:13.350]  Yeah, we covered it on F*** Face.
[28:13.890 --> 28:17.270]  We took him to get Route 44 diet cherry limeades, and when he got out of his car, he fucking
[28:17.270 --> 28:19.050]  chunked it across the house, and I was laughing at him.
[28:19.310 --> 28:20.610]  I was holding it by the lid.
[28:21.190 --> 28:22.150]  It got away from me.
[28:23.530 --> 28:24.210]  That'll happen.

[29:02.650 --> 29:05.370]  That IS one perfect combination.
[29:06.710 --> 29:07.430]  Ahhhh…
[29:07.430 --> 29:09.090]  Burgers deserve Pepsi.
[29:09.350 --> 29:10.390]  And then...
[29:10.390 --> 29:12.330]  Just because I can't...
[29:12.330 --> 29:13.930]  Ah fuck...
[29:13.930 --> 29:14.690]  You know what, fuck it.
[29:15.210 --> 29:15.990]  I'm from Alabama.
[29:16.610 --> 29:17.330]  seated
[29:19.370 --> 29:21.550]  Not what I thought you were going for with that.
[29:22.150 --> 29:30.150]  I thought you were maybe considering Big Red.
[29:30.970 --> 29:32.450]  Nah, I forgot all about Big Red.
[29:33.170 --> 29:36.110]  Big Red is a great drink once every two years.
[29:39.050 --> 29:44.930]  I've had Big Red once in my life. It was when I visited Austin and I got sick and I didn't know I was sick yet.
[29:44.930 --> 29:49.130]  And I came back from RTX and I had drank Big Red at lunch.
[29:49.250 --> 29:53.750]  And I vomited the reddest puke. Maybe the second reddest puke.
[29:54.370 --> 29:57.450]  Just Big Red everywhere.
[29:58.670 --> 30:00.830]  Projectile like horror movie blood vomit.
[30:01.370 --> 30:03.290]  And it kind of killed Big Red for me.
[30:03.450 --> 30:06.570]  Do you think we could be the first group of five to chunk the rainbow?
[30:10.090 --> 30:11.930]  Maybe like simultaneously?
[30:12.430 --> 30:14.810]  Or like just... oh man.
[30:15.110 --> 30:20.690]  You do Big Red, orange juice, uh, like lemonade.
[30:22.490 --> 30:24.250]  What would you do with the last two?
[30:24.330 --> 30:26.270]  Cause it's gotta be like, you want like blue and green?
[30:26.450 --> 30:28.430]  Or do you want to get like a purple in there? Like what are you feeling?
[30:29.370 --> 30:32.150]  Purple would be Grape Crush. Blue, there's a Mountain Dew.
[30:32.150 --> 30:32.710]  You could put Vimto.
[30:33.750 --> 30:35.310]  You could have some Vimto.
[30:35.570 --> 30:36.730]  Vimto would be great for purple.
[30:36.750 --> 30:37.330]  Some Ribena.
[30:37.330 --> 30:42.710]  Yeah, and then we just all vomit on a leprechaun or something.
[30:43.930 --> 30:46.630]  So we just eat green? What's a green drink?
[30:47.670 --> 30:48.290]  Green tea chai?
[30:49.330 --> 30:50.270]  Oh, Mountain Dew works.
[30:50.550 --> 30:50.990]  Yeah.
[30:51.790 --> 30:53.870]  Is it green or is the bottle green?
[30:54.410 --> 30:56.290]  If you pour out a Mountain Dew, is it clear?
[30:56.510 --> 30:57.670]  I think it might be clear.
[30:58.110 --> 30:59.290]  I don't think it's clear.
[30:59.730 --> 31:02.590]  There's green Hawaiian Punch. There's green Gatorade.
[31:03.530 --> 31:04.690]  Ew, there's a lot of green.
[31:05.890 --> 31:09.410]  So why are we vomiting on a leprechaun, Gavin? Why not into like a pot?
[31:10.270 --> 31:11.250]  Oh, is it the pot at the end?
[31:12.190 --> 31:13.530]  Yeah, it's a leprechaun.
[31:14.170 --> 31:15.430]  We'll chunk on to a pot of gold.
[31:15.810 --> 31:18.670]  Why do I throw... I want to throw up on a leprechaun. I think that'd be way more fun.
[31:19.110 --> 31:21.970]  Yeah, and then the gold's not, you know, all messed up.
[31:22.630 --> 31:25.510]  Whoever comes in last place has to be the leprechaun.
[31:26.190 --> 31:26.910]  Number five.
[31:27.870 --> 31:28.550]  Patreon vote.
[31:30.650 --> 31:32.570]  Loser prize for face-off season two.
[31:33.030 --> 31:37.870]  How did we go from starting a lemonade stand to having one of us get thrown up on by everybody else?
[31:38.130 --> 31:39.090]  It's the way it goes, man.
[31:39.410 --> 31:40.670]  It happened very quickly, too.
[31:40.690 --> 31:42.730]  What do you mean because of me? It's because of you.
[31:42.990 --> 31:43.990]  You threw up some big red.
[31:44.630 --> 31:47.530]  Yeah, but you led it to puking a leprechaun.
[31:47.670 --> 31:49.890]  You led it to puking and I took it from there.
[31:50.650 --> 31:54.530]  Okay. I think you're more the cause, but I see where you're coming from.
[31:54.970 --> 31:59.030]  I brought us to puke town. You parked us in leprechaun alley.
[32:00.450 --> 32:03.070]  Why don't you take us home with your fourth one?
[32:03.070 --> 32:08.110]  Well, if you insist. If we're talking about puking, here's a drink that probably would make Jeff puke.
[32:08.170 --> 32:11.090]  I don't know, but I assume eggnog is my number four.
[32:13.750 --> 32:16.070]  I'd rather die. I love eggnog.
[32:16.710 --> 32:17.730]  Are you actually trying to win?
[32:18.770 --> 32:20.170]  Yeah, these are my picks.
[32:20.310 --> 32:21.270]  Not anymore, I don't think.
[32:22.170 --> 32:23.370]  What do you mean? These are great picks.
[32:23.610 --> 32:27.190]  He's going to win a lot of people over with Diet Coke and pumpkin spice latte.
[32:27.590 --> 32:28.170]  That's fair.
[32:28.610 --> 32:29.810]  You guys don't like eggnog?
[32:30.470 --> 32:30.850]  No.
[32:31.090 --> 32:31.890]  You're not noggin over here?
[32:32.410 --> 32:33.450]  I'm not noggin.
[32:33.510 --> 32:34.310]  I'm not a fan of the nog.
[32:34.590 --> 32:34.910]  What?
[32:35.030 --> 32:39.750]  And it's really the egg's fault, once again. The egg thing really throws me.
[32:40.850 --> 32:42.710]  I don't think there's any egg in eggnog, is there?
[32:43.970 --> 32:45.030]  Then why is egg there?
[32:45.550 --> 32:46.810]  I think so.
[32:47.890 --> 32:50.690]  I think you can make it without... I'm pretty sure you can make it.
[32:51.010 --> 32:53.210]  Yeah, see, what if we did an an-egg-nog?
[32:54.630 --> 32:55.970]  I'm kind of on board now.
[32:55.970 --> 32:59.650]  If we get Gracie back and hire someone, two people starting with N and O.
[32:59.910 --> 33:00.130]  Yeah.
[33:01.030 --> 33:02.710]  There's definitely eggs in eggnog.
[33:02.710 --> 33:05.010]  Yeah, there's eggs, cream, sugar, milk.
[33:05.310 --> 33:07.770]  First ingredient, six large egg yolks.
[33:07.950 --> 33:11.510]  No, you can just do it without the eggs.
[33:11.810 --> 33:13.010]  That's a lot of egg.
[33:13.470 --> 33:14.530]  You guys are so hung up.
[33:14.530 --> 33:16.330]  I wonder why they don't serve this in the summer.
[33:17.330 --> 33:20.490]  Why would you drink it in the summer? That's insane. This is a Christmas drink.
[33:20.790 --> 33:23.730]  You're wearing a sweater, you're drinking that. Ooh, it's good.
[33:23.990 --> 33:25.450]  That's good stuff right there, baby.
[33:27.590 --> 33:30.710]  But now, it's time for Nick's final pick.
[33:30.750 --> 33:32.950]  I still want to know what the nog is.
[33:33.070 --> 33:35.230]  We know what the egg is. Where does the nog come in?
[33:35.670 --> 33:39.470]  Dude, this is even worse. I'm reading Wikipedia, and this is how they describe it.
[33:39.550 --> 33:40.530]  This is so gross.
[33:42.030 --> 33:45.330]  Eggnog, historically also known as milk punch.
[33:45.710 --> 33:47.290]  Or egg milk punch.
[33:48.010 --> 33:49.410]  I see why they changed the name.
[33:49.630 --> 33:50.930]  Fucking milk punch?
[33:51.970 --> 33:54.110]  Fucking shoot me in the head.
[33:54.110 --> 33:54.650]  There you go.
[33:56.110 --> 33:57.070]  Milk punch?
[33:59.850 --> 34:02.970]  Well, again, another drink when you come in from the heat.
[34:03.350 --> 34:04.110]  And you want to take a break.
[34:04.890 --> 34:07.130]  But yeah, definitely an eggnog. You put it on extra ice.
[34:07.630 --> 34:08.650]  But if you want a little kick.
[34:09.670 --> 34:12.790]  Still of some caffeine.
[34:13.790 --> 34:14.270]  Frappuccino.
[34:15.470 --> 34:16.430]  Yeah, frappuccino.
[34:16.770 --> 34:21.270]  You get yourself a nice lemonade with a sweet tea, and you make an Arnold Palmer.
[34:21.590 --> 34:22.770]  And I'm going with the Arnold Palmer.
[34:22.770 --> 34:24.630]  Because it's the best of both worlds.
[34:24.790 --> 34:26.970]  You get the sweet, you get the cooling effect.
[34:27.090 --> 34:30.150]  And you get a little bit of that energy from the caffeine.
[34:30.670 --> 34:33.770]  So you've got coffee, tea with coffee.
[34:35.310 --> 34:37.030]  Lemonade, tea with lemonade.
[34:39.210 --> 34:40.190]  They're all different.
[34:43.850 --> 34:45.690]  Put it that way, Gavin.
[34:46.310 --> 34:49.090]  When Jeff has sweet tea, it's awesome.
[34:49.590 --> 34:50.690]  It makes it so much funnier.
[34:50.690 --> 34:54.070]  Gavin has coffee.
[34:54.310 --> 34:55.850]  Jeff has sweet tea.
[34:56.150 --> 34:58.490]  Nick has coffee and sweet tea.
[35:01.650 --> 35:03.150]  Juice is an option.
[35:03.530 --> 35:05.330]  There's so many drinks.
[35:08.010 --> 35:10.170]  Nobody picked a white monster.
[35:11.150 --> 35:13.670]  But we're not day laborers.
[35:13.890 --> 35:15.430]  So I just assumed no one would pick that.
[35:15.750 --> 35:18.990]  Yeah, but it's probably what I drink more than anything else.
[35:19.110 --> 35:19.630]  When I think about it.
[35:19.670 --> 35:20.670]  Oh, God.
[35:23.250 --> 35:24.650]  Well, next up is Andrew.
[35:24.850 --> 35:25.490]  His final pick.
[35:26.050 --> 35:28.290]  Andrew, before you give us your final pick.
[35:34.340 --> 35:36.040]  Andrew, before you give us your final pick.
[35:37.060 --> 35:37.500]  Yeah.
[35:38.100 --> 35:40.440]  How many things are not...
[35:40.440 --> 35:43.440]  How many items do you have listed that you aren't going to be picking?
[35:45.080 --> 35:45.960]  Oh, oh.
[35:46.620 --> 35:47.240]  Let's see.
[35:47.420 --> 35:48.480]  Let me pull up my list.
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.360]  I have 21 drinks.
[35:51.820 --> 35:52.940]  Oh, my God.
[35:52.940 --> 35:53.520]  Yeah.
[35:54.420 --> 35:56.580]  I don't think I could name 21 drinks.
[35:56.700 --> 35:57.100]  Nope.
[35:57.620 --> 36:02.180]  Well, I could. Coffee, Americano, Pumpkin Spice Latte, Espresso.
[36:02.360 --> 36:04.120]  Arnold Palmer, Shirley Temple.
[36:04.480 --> 36:05.840]  A bunch of old other names.
[36:05.940 --> 36:07.680]  Should I run down Marilyn Monroe?
[36:08.400 --> 36:09.600]  You don't have to give them all.
[36:09.740 --> 36:10.780]  I just wanted to know.
[36:10.980 --> 36:13.040]  Because I felt like you came in way over prepared
[36:13.560 --> 36:14.280]  against me.
[36:14.320 --> 36:16.400]  A guy who listed water first and then didn't pick.
[36:17.880 --> 36:18.700]  I'm going to be honest.
[36:19.100 --> 36:20.640]  I considered water.
[36:20.640 --> 36:22.580]  But I really didn't want to get fucked like Gavin.
[36:22.700 --> 36:24.580]  To have somebody come in with sparkling water
[36:24.580 --> 36:26.020]  and get completely undercut.
[36:26.120 --> 36:27.940]  It felt like a trap.
[36:28.240 --> 36:28.880]  Yeah, that's lame.
[36:31.340 --> 36:32.140]  Oh, man.
[36:32.740 --> 36:34.220]  So many things to choose from.
[36:35.600 --> 36:37.240]  I think I'll round out.
[36:37.380 --> 36:38.620]  I have a soda theme.
[36:38.660 --> 36:39.840]  So I think I'll stick with soda.
[36:40.440 --> 36:41.680]  I like a root beer.
[36:42.180 --> 36:44.360]  And I think the number one root beer is Barks Root Beer.
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.840]  So I'm going to close out my bubble.
[36:46.840 --> 36:47.200]  That's a great one.
[36:47.800 --> 36:48.640]  Barks Root Beer.
[36:49.100 --> 36:50.580]  I almost picked Root Beer.
[36:50.580 --> 36:53.160]  I like an IBC myself, but Barks is really good too.
[36:53.400 --> 36:55.480]  IBC? Okay. I don't know if I've had that one.
[36:56.280 --> 36:57.080]  IBC Root Beer.
[36:58.220 --> 36:58.700]  It's good.
[36:59.060 --> 37:01.880]  Is it like a known wide brand in America?
[37:02.060 --> 37:03.200]  Or is it like a...
[37:03.760 --> 37:04.020]  Yeah.
[37:04.220 --> 37:06.240]  Yeah, IBC, it's big.
[37:07.620 --> 37:08.060]  Interesting.
[37:08.680 --> 37:09.760]  You can get it anywhere in America.
[37:09.900 --> 37:11.800]  It comes in a bottle.
[37:13.380 --> 37:15.540]  Currently unavailable on Amazon.ca.
[37:15.540 --> 37:17.320]  I'll see if I can get this somehow.
[37:17.800 --> 37:18.820]  Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
[37:19.000 --> 37:19.480]  Interesting.
[37:21.160 --> 37:23.080]  You know what I should have picked if I really
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.960]  wanted Gavin's heart is Dad's Root Beer.
[37:26.440 --> 37:27.320]  I don't know if
[37:28.180 --> 37:29.580]  that's a thing that is just
[37:29.580 --> 37:31.280]  Canadian only, but everyone brings
[37:31.280 --> 37:32.500]  Dad back into this.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.040]  They actually sell it in Austin.
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.560]  Really? Okay.
[37:36.800 --> 37:39.540]  Just a root beer bottle that says Dad's
[37:39.540 --> 37:41.200]  felt Canadian to me for some reason.
[37:41.940 --> 37:42.820]  It probably is.
[37:42.820 --> 37:44.640]  I used to get it at Costco.
[37:45.660 --> 37:46.440]  Oh, really?
[37:46.940 --> 37:48.320]  I think I saw it at Big Lots.
[37:49.540 --> 37:50.940]  I used to get it at
[37:50.940 --> 37:53.180]  Costco when Costco was Price Club.
[37:54.900 --> 37:56.060]  Holy shit, dude.
[37:56.800 --> 37:58.620]  Yeah. I don't remember that at all.
[37:59.320 --> 37:59.620]  Oh, yeah.
[37:59.680 --> 38:02.940]  Is anybody actually drinking
[38:02.940 --> 38:03.540]  anything right now?
[38:04.200 --> 38:06.600]  I am drinking something related to
[38:06.600 --> 38:08.740]  a draft that we're not going to end up recording today.
[38:09.040 --> 38:09.460]  Okay.
[38:11.900 --> 38:12.840]  Because I just realized
[38:12.840 --> 38:14.680]  I'm drinking a Bang Purple Haze
[38:14.680 --> 38:16.460]  energy drink, which did not get mentioned.
[38:17.040 --> 38:18.940]  As soon as we're done here,
[38:18.940 --> 38:20.880]  I'm going to go make a cup of the very
[38:20.880 --> 38:22.180]  first pick on this whole draft.
[38:23.080 --> 38:24.320]  But nothing right now.
[38:24.900 --> 38:26.480]  I was thinking about going with the number three.
[38:30.640 --> 38:31.940]  See how they're different, Gavin?
[38:32.020 --> 38:32.880]  Yeah, they're different, Gavin.
[38:33.460 --> 38:34.180]  Totally different.
[38:40.100 --> 38:41.540]  If Gavin were to put that up
[38:41.540 --> 38:43.340]  for a vote, Geoff, would you have voted against
[38:43.340 --> 38:44.000]  the Americana?
[38:47.220 --> 38:48.640]  I would have voted no to it.
[38:50.040 --> 38:51.020]  So it just comes down
[38:51.020 --> 38:51.420]  to you.
[38:53.240 --> 38:55.060]  Yeah, I probably would have
[38:55.060 --> 38:55.880]  voted no.
[38:58.900 --> 38:59.960]  That's too bad we waited.
[39:01.100 --> 39:02.860]  Because now that I think about it,
[39:02.920 --> 39:05.020]  I mean, materially, it's the same thing.
[39:05.240 --> 39:06.880]  You're not even really adding any different
[39:06.880 --> 39:08.840]  ingredients into it. It's just a preparation
[39:08.840 --> 39:10.780]  deal. Yeah, I don't think so.
[39:11.200 --> 39:12.360]  And honestly, hey, Gavin,
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.360]  apology accepted. Yeah, you know what?
[39:16.580 --> 39:18.640]  Yeah, I think you've got to fight for yourself a little bit harder,
[39:18.780 --> 39:20.740]  Gavin. I would have been in your corner now that I think about it.
[39:20.860 --> 39:22.060]  Yeah, Gavin, I'm over it. Thanks, man.
[39:23.220 --> 39:25.080]  Hey, no worries. Let's just move past it, yeah?
[39:25.860 --> 39:26.880]  Oh, we should move past
[39:26.880 --> 39:28.700]  the very last pick of this draft, Gavin.
[39:28.800 --> 39:30.680]  Go ahead. Oh, we've got Coca-Cola,
[39:30.860 --> 39:33.300]  Diet Coke, Mexican Coke.
[39:33.700 --> 39:34.840]  Mexican Coke was on
[39:34.840 --> 39:35.960]  my list!
[39:35.960 --> 39:37.060]  That's a good one.
[39:37.420 --> 39:40.020]  So nobody picked water.
[39:40.560 --> 39:41.860]  That's so fucking
[39:41.860 --> 39:42.740]  funny to me.
[39:46.700 --> 39:48.100]  What is Mexican Coke?
[39:48.220 --> 39:49.560]  It's just like sugar Coke.
[39:49.740 --> 39:51.080]  Yeah, they made it with sugar.
[39:51.500 --> 39:52.760]  With cane sugar, I think.
[39:54.480 --> 39:56.040]  What is this thing
[39:56.040 --> 39:57.860]  I picked? Yeah, pick a thing
[39:57.860 --> 39:59.380]  and then follow it with what is it?
[40:00.600 --> 40:02.040]  I'm adapting to the
[40:02.040 --> 40:03.980]  table. You're doing great.
[40:04.440 --> 40:05.260]  You're doing great.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.980]  That was definitely on my list.
[40:08.300 --> 40:10.300]  And you consider Mexican Coke
[40:10.300 --> 40:11.540]  to be different than Coke?
[40:11.620 --> 40:13.100]  This is why I didn't pick it, Gavin.
[40:14.240 --> 40:15.560]  Oh, you didn't pick it?
[40:15.900 --> 40:17.540]  Well, I didn't pick it because
[40:17.540 --> 40:19.860]  it was on my list, but I didn't pick it because
[40:19.860 --> 40:21.840]  I didn't want to have this conversation about how it was
[40:21.840 --> 40:23.340]  different from Coca-Cola and your pick.
[40:23.920 --> 40:24.680]  No, it is different.
[40:25.060 --> 40:27.640]  It's different brands, like a
[40:27.640 --> 40:29.740]  Doritos Coke. I mean, if you
[40:29.740 --> 40:31.820]  want to go with Cola, you could have went with a Pepsi.
[40:31.820 --> 40:33.680]  There's all sorts of Colas you could pick.
[40:33.820 --> 40:36.280]  Yeah, it's night and day. It's Americano
[40:36.280 --> 40:37.200]  and Latte.
[40:39.920 --> 40:41.980]  I was on your side with the coffee thing.
[40:42.940 --> 40:43.860]  You would have put it to a vote.
[40:44.340 --> 40:46.000]  Here's the thing. The one thing
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.700]  I'll say in Americano's defense,
[40:47.780 --> 40:49.200]  it doesn't have the word coffee in it.
[40:49.320 --> 40:51.300]  Mexican Coke still has the word Coke in it.
[40:57.020 --> 40:58.100]  My favorite Coke
[40:58.100 --> 40:59.800]  is Jeff's Kitchen Coke.
[40:59.800 --> 41:01.500]  It's pretty localized.
[41:02.020 --> 41:03.720]  Crisp Diet Coke.
[41:05.180 --> 41:07.360]  I like Crispy Diet Coke.
[41:09.200 --> 41:11.660]  Wow, what a list. What a solid list from everyone.
[41:12.140 --> 41:14.280]  Well, let's run
[41:14.280 --> 41:15.840]  them down and we can talk about it.
[41:15.880 --> 41:17.540]  Gavin picked Coffee Bar for a
[41:17.540 --> 41:19.560]  little Mexican Coke.
[41:20.200 --> 41:21.700]  That's gotta be the least
[41:21.700 --> 41:23.940]  complimentary set of drinks I've ever heard.
[41:24.280 --> 41:25.880]  Is Lilt the only
[41:25.880 --> 41:27.940]  one on the list that's no longer commercially
[41:27.940 --> 41:29.780]  available? It is, right?
[41:29.880 --> 41:31.720]  Probably. I think so, yeah.
[41:32.120 --> 41:34.020]  Andrew picked Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper,
[41:34.260 --> 41:35.860]  Mountain Dew, Code Red, and Barks
[41:35.860 --> 41:37.500]  Root Beer. Nick picked
[41:38.320 --> 41:39.860]  Americano, London Fog
[41:39.860 --> 41:41.460]  with Espresso, Lemonade,
[41:41.620 --> 41:42.560]  Arnold Palmer.
[41:44.100 --> 41:46.160]  That's maybe the funniest list.
[41:46.600 --> 41:48.140]  That's maybe the funniest list
[41:48.140 --> 41:48.840]  on this whole thing.
[41:49.640 --> 41:51.440]  Eric picked Diet Coke,
[41:51.740 --> 41:53.320]  Pumpkin Spice Latte, Horchata,
[41:53.840 --> 41:55.700]  Eggnog, aka Milk Punch.
[41:55.700 --> 41:57.160]  And Jeff
[41:57.700 --> 41:59.800]  Jeff picked Diet Starry,
[42:00.240 --> 42:01.840]  Vimto, Root 44,
[42:02.120 --> 42:03.540]  Diet Cherry, Limeade from
[42:03.540 --> 42:05.340]  Sonic, and Sweet Tea.
[42:05.940 --> 42:07.760]  I'm amazed at everybody's picks.
[42:07.880 --> 42:09.420]  Like, the fact that Nick just
[42:09.420 --> 42:11.320]  cannibalized from Nick over and over
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.100]  is kind of funny.
[42:13.300 --> 42:15.640]  And then I did not expect Andrew
[42:15.640 --> 42:17.520]  to go out of the game. Four
[42:17.520 --> 42:19.100]  sodas for Andrew. Yep.
[42:19.460 --> 42:20.780]  I didn't expect you to go Vimto.
[42:21.540 --> 42:22.760]  Wow, I had to keep guessing.
[42:22.760 --> 42:24.880]  Whoa, Nick Vimto out of nowhere.
[42:25.160 --> 42:26.640]  Nick's picks is like a family
[42:26.640 --> 42:28.860]  tree of drinks. It really
[42:28.860 --> 42:30.520]  it's crazy.
[42:30.680 --> 42:31.240]  But they're all different.
[42:32.400 --> 42:33.160]  So it's okay.
[42:35.060 --> 42:37.120]  Yeah, it would...
[42:37.120 --> 42:38.800]  Right, an Americano
[42:38.800 --> 42:40.780]  is different from a London Fog with
[42:40.780 --> 42:42.820]  Espresso because there's tea in one
[42:42.820 --> 42:44.800]  of them and the other one doesn't have tea in it.
[42:44.900 --> 42:46.480]  But it's exactly the same. You got it.
[42:46.780 --> 42:48.720]  They're different. And an Arnold Palmer
[42:48.720 --> 42:50.460]  is totally different than Lemonade.
[42:50.460 --> 42:51.100]  Yeah, tap.
[42:54.600 --> 42:56.560]  My last pick should have been sweet tea
[42:56.560 --> 42:57.120]  and Vimto.
[43:02.840 --> 43:04.580]  Oh yeah, my last pick
[43:04.580 --> 43:06.360]  is a Gavin Free. It's a
[43:06.360 --> 43:07.760]  sweet tea with Vimto.
[43:08.220 --> 43:08.420]  Yeah.
[43:10.580 --> 43:11.620]  One of
[43:12.340 --> 43:14.600]  the many joys of doing these
[43:14.600 --> 43:16.640]  is not at all expecting
[43:16.640 --> 43:18.540]  it to go the way that I think
[43:19.460 --> 43:20.520]  it would. In my head
[43:20.520 --> 43:22.540]  it's a debate of like, what brand?
[43:22.700 --> 43:24.580]  What version of Barks or Root Beer
[43:24.580 --> 43:26.820]  do you like the best? What version of this?
[43:27.300 --> 43:28.460]  I never could have
[43:28.460 --> 43:30.520]  predicted that Nick would essentially pick the
[43:30.520 --> 43:31.640]  same drink four times.
[43:32.360 --> 43:34.240]  I guess twice, twice.
[43:34.500 --> 43:36.720]  I'm actually right there with you, Andrew.
[43:36.880 --> 43:38.380]  I'm a little flummoxed
[43:38.380 --> 43:39.080]  by the expectations.
[43:39.560 --> 43:42.480]  I think Nick's
[43:42.480 --> 43:43.600]  on track to win this draft.
[43:44.100 --> 43:45.920]  There's no way Nick wins.
[43:45.920 --> 43:47.980]  If Nick wins, it's on comedy
[43:47.980 --> 43:50.380]  value, which I mean, I guess...
[43:50.380 --> 43:52.220]  No, if you're a coffee fan,
[43:52.340 --> 43:53.920]  if you're a coffee fan, you're voting with
[43:53.920 --> 43:56.020]  Nick. Even though I picked coffee.
[43:58.180 --> 43:59.840]  Well, yeah, because if I pick you,
[43:59.920 --> 44:02.040]  you also pick Bovril and Lilt.
[44:02.420 --> 44:03.900]  Yeah. Alright, I may have been going
[44:03.900 --> 44:04.740]  for comedy a little bit.
[44:06.620 --> 44:07.860]  Oh, I was
[44:07.860 --> 44:08.560]  going for Spike.
[44:09.740 --> 44:11.680]  Jesus Christ. Well, guys, go
[44:11.680 --> 44:13.700]  vote on our Patreon. Whoever
[44:13.700 --> 44:15.780]  wins gets their first
[44:15.780 --> 44:17.920]  choice. I don't want a diet
[44:17.920 --> 44:19.760]  Coke. Yeah, Eric is
[44:19.760 --> 44:21.700]  going to either get a drink he doesn't want.
[44:22.760 --> 44:23.840]  Gavin is going to get
[44:23.840 --> 44:25.480]  just black coffee, I guess.
[44:25.820 --> 44:27.420]  What would be...
[44:27.420 --> 44:29.700]  Yeah, and then Nick
[44:29.700 --> 44:31.580]  is going to get his first and second
[44:31.580 --> 44:32.120]  pick.
[44:37.900 --> 44:39.760]  Jeff and I will be happy. We win.
[44:41.140 --> 44:42.080]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[44:42.280 --> 44:43.720]  I have a varied list.
[44:43.720 --> 44:45.140]  None of my stuff is...
[44:45.140 --> 44:46.700]  All my shit is unique and original.
[44:47.020 --> 44:48.940]  Not stolen from anybody else.
[44:51.240 --> 44:52.580]  What a draft.
[44:54.320 --> 44:55.280]  It's the most
[44:55.280 --> 44:57.300]  I don't know how the poll is going to go. I have
[44:57.300 --> 44:59.400]  no clue. That was one of our
[44:59.400 --> 45:00.740]  best. Definitely.
[45:01.800 --> 45:03.540]  Guys, go follow us on Patreon.

[45:07.440 --> 45:09.560]  Gameplay, where we put all of our gameplays
[45:09.560 --> 45:11.340]  up. This one was a crazy one.
[45:11.340 --> 45:12.900]  This one was punchy.
[45:13.060 --> 45:14.540]  Thank you so much.
[45:14.940 --> 45:17.040]  Anything else before we take off?
[45:18.280 --> 45:19.480]  Just Pepsi,
[45:21.100 --> 45:21.700]  Sprite,
[45:22.220 --> 45:23.500]  Mountain Dew Baja Blast,
[45:23.680 --> 45:25.060]  Canada Dry 7 Up,
[45:25.220 --> 45:27.640]  Mugroot Beer, Grape Crush, Orange Crush,
[45:27.940 --> 45:29.320]  Mountain Dew Melon, Cherry Barks,
[45:29.420 --> 45:31.080]  Cherry Coke, Orange Fresca,
[45:31.560 --> 45:33.020]  Doritos Pineapple, Doritos Cola,
[45:33.160 --> 45:34.800]  L&P, Hot Chocolate.
[45:35.980 --> 45:36.560]  This is real.
[45:37.080 --> 45:38.420]  Hot Chocolate.
[45:38.420 --> 45:40.460]  I was trying to get Lucozade and Iron Brew
[45:40.460 --> 45:41.820]  on that, but they never came up.
[45:42.560 --> 45:43.860]  Shout out to Orange Juice.
[45:44.220 --> 45:46.700]  I'm sorry I didn't pick you, but I still love you.
[45:49.860 --> 45:51.940]  Alright, thank you for watching. Bye.
[45:52.460 --> 45:54.680]  Bye now. I'd draft Orange Juice
[45:54.680 --> 45:56.460]  with less pulp would be my pick
[45:56.460 --> 45:58.340]  if Geoff won Orange Juice. They're different.
[45:58.920 --> 45:59.740]  Dude, I'll take your point.
[46:00.260 --> 46:02.340]  They're different. Like my pick.
[46:02.360 --> 46:02.580]  Bye.
