[00:00.000 --> 00:03.580]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.920 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[00:06.960 --> 00:10.500]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.860 --> 00:14.700]  Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.120 --> 00:16.020]  How are you doing, Gavin?
[00:16.720 --> 00:17.720]  Fine, thank you.
[00:19.180 --> 00:20.340]  All right, there you go.
[00:21.660 --> 00:22.460]  Do you guys want to start the podcast?
[00:22.560 --> 00:24.340]  I thought that was a sufficient answer, Gavin.
[00:24.600 --> 00:27.280]  Yeah, I agree. I don't know why that was a weird reaction.
[00:27.800 --> 00:28.780]  Yeah, Jeff.
[00:29.580 --> 00:31.840]  I... what was weird about my reaction? I just laughed.
[00:32.320 --> 00:34.720]  You guys are comedians being funny. Shouldn't I laugh?
[00:35.020 --> 00:36.260]  Wait, who's being weird? Me or Jeff?
[00:36.940 --> 00:38.880]  I think he's saying I'm being weird because I laughed
[00:38.880 --> 00:40.500]  because I think that you guys are...
[00:40.500 --> 00:44.320]  There was a tone of Gavin's in a bad mood by Jeff with that laugh.
[00:44.340 --> 00:46.360]  I don't think Gavin's in a bad mood at all.
[00:46.560 --> 00:49.800]  I think Gavin's... I just spent like two hours playing video games with him.
[00:49.940 --> 00:52.040]  Gavin was great. What are you talking about?
[00:52.180 --> 00:53.740]  Perfect afternoon so far.
[00:53.820 --> 00:56.240]  Yeah, I'm just saying that that's what the tone that was delivered.
[00:56.240 --> 00:59.920]  That was intentional, but that is how it kind of came across to me.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.940]  I feel like if anybody's in a bad mood,
[01:02.060 --> 01:05.060]  it's probably the one who's pointing fingers at other people for being in a bad mood.
[01:05.060 --> 01:05.660]  Oh, I'm in a great mood.
[01:05.660 --> 01:06.480]  If I'm being honest with you.
[01:07.080 --> 01:09.660]  I had a 20 minute nap between our gear session.
[01:10.460 --> 01:12.240]  I was in the Discord the whole time for it.
[01:12.480 --> 01:13.860]  Is it a bad mood finger pointer?
[01:14.760 --> 01:16.720]  No, I don't think so. I'm just happy.
[01:17.040 --> 01:19.180]  We haven't even started a podcast yet and Andrew's already pointed fingers at us.
[01:19.220 --> 01:20.600]  All right, should we get to it?
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.100]  I think Nick's in a bad mood.
[01:22.300 --> 01:22.520]  What?
[01:24.660 --> 01:26.980]  No, we fed him this morning for 100% eat.
[01:27.040 --> 01:27.680]  He's in a great mood.
[01:27.760 --> 01:28.080]  Yeah.
[01:28.120 --> 01:28.860]  All right, here we go.
[01:29.100 --> 01:33.680]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:34.040 --> 01:36.860]  My name is Jeff Ramsey and with me, as always,
[01:37.020 --> 01:41.040]  Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, and Eric Baddour.
[01:42.180 --> 01:44.460]  This is episode five, which is...
[01:44.460 --> 01:45.340]  I know a lot more about water.
[01:46.020 --> 01:48.960]  Like episode 209 or something, maybe?
[01:49.100 --> 01:49.440]  I don't know.
[01:49.680 --> 01:50.200]  Who can tell?
[01:50.280 --> 01:51.020]  I've learned this thing too.
[01:51.540 --> 01:52.500]  Yeah, do you want to go into it?
[01:52.500 --> 01:53.740]  Do you want to tell us everything you learned?
[01:53.980 --> 01:56.620]  Well, I figured it out.
[01:56.740 --> 01:59.140]  I mean, you guys gave a good helping hand last episode.
[01:59.340 --> 02:04.500]  I really pieced it together later myself when I equated it to electricity.
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.080]  Just because like the electricity...
[02:07.080 --> 02:07.780]  It's always going.
[02:08.340 --> 02:11.220]  If I flip the switch, then I use it.
[02:11.560 --> 02:12.780]  But it's always there.
[02:12.860 --> 02:15.600]  It's not like I'm creating electricity when I flip the switch.
[02:16.100 --> 02:16.980]  Much like water.
[02:16.980 --> 02:18.060]  Water is always going.
[02:18.580 --> 02:20.480]  It's always on the move.
[02:20.780 --> 02:25.860]  Just because I have the thing twisted doesn't mean I'm creating water.
[02:26.480 --> 02:28.280]  It's just I'm pulling from a resource.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.720]  You thought you were inventing water out of thin air?
[02:32.440 --> 02:33.120]  Like alchemy?
[02:33.280 --> 02:33.460]  Well, no.
[02:33.540 --> 02:38.740]  Just like I thought, you know, if I had the thing twisted, I was pulling from the water supply.
[02:39.460 --> 02:40.280]  That wasn't...
[02:40.280 --> 02:43.240]  Like I was initiating water being created, essentially.
[02:43.380 --> 02:44.060]  I guess...
[02:44.060 --> 02:44.320]  Yeah.
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.700]  Not that I was creating water, but like I was initiating a pull for water.
[02:48.840 --> 02:51.000]  Like you were requesting water and it was being sent over.
[02:51.200 --> 02:52.400]  Yes, exactly.
[02:52.800 --> 02:53.960]  Okay, so you were like...
[02:53.960 --> 02:56.280]  You requisitioned water and then they delivered it.
[02:56.420 --> 02:58.320]  Yeah, but that's not how that worked.
[02:58.400 --> 03:00.880]  It's a bunch of doors and it's always actually moving.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.320]  Much like electricity.
[03:02.660 --> 03:04.120]  It's always going.
[03:04.820 --> 03:07.980]  I just flip the switch to tap into what's already there.
[03:08.040 --> 03:10.580]  Not that I am actually creating electricity.
[03:11.080 --> 03:12.120]  You know what as well?
[03:12.560 --> 03:12.880]  What?
[03:13.520 --> 03:13.960]  Gas.
[03:15.020 --> 03:18.260]  Oh, I don't even... I don't... I can't see it, so I don't want to even get into that.
[03:18.640 --> 03:21.840]  You know what we are creating is magic with this bit.
[03:23.020 --> 03:23.960]  It's not even a bit.
[03:24.100 --> 03:27.140]  That's not a bit because Andrew genuinely doesn't know how to look at it.
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.440]  No, I learned a lot about water last week and I just wanted to give an update that I feel like I got my brain around it.
[03:32.640 --> 03:35.460]  And I think we all learned don't drink the hot tap.
[03:37.240 --> 03:37.960]  Certainly not if you're in the UK.
[03:37.960 --> 03:43.380]  I guess you're kind of right about that from what I've seen from people posting and stuff in reaction to that episode.
[03:43.380 --> 03:47.440]  Apparently in a lot of places you're drinking rust, dust, and rat shit.
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.940]  Yeah, those places are third world countries called the United Kingdom, unfortunately.
[03:53.120 --> 03:54.700]  What do you guys want to talk about today?
[03:55.260 --> 03:56.940]  I mean, I have all sorts of things I can talk about.
[03:56.940 --> 03:57.800]  I have notes.
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.200]  I learned something.
[03:59.620 --> 04:00.980]  Can I extend?
[04:01.200 --> 04:02.460]  I'm learning all sorts of things.
[04:03.360 --> 04:09.540]  I learned that opera music, they're actually saying stuff and that blew my mind.
[04:10.060 --> 04:12.180]  I had no idea.
[04:12.180 --> 04:13.300]  Yes, you did.
[04:13.520 --> 04:14.440]  No, I didn't.
[04:14.640 --> 04:16.200]  Do you think it was fucking sounds?
[04:16.380 --> 04:17.320]  Do you think it was like...
[04:17.320 --> 04:21.120]  I thought that it was a visual storytelling medium.
[04:21.700 --> 04:25.700]  And then they were just like making emotional noises as sort of...
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.640]  I've never really thought about opera that much.
[04:27.660 --> 04:29.040]  Everyone mimicked exactly?
[04:30.020 --> 04:32.280]  Listen, I didn't pursue opera.
[04:32.460 --> 04:36.320]  Okay, so I don't have a large breadth of knowledge when it comes to it.
[04:36.520 --> 04:38.380]  I think my biggest exposure to it...
[04:38.380 --> 04:39.200]  Mostly Italian, I think.
[04:39.220 --> 04:40.680]  ...was Hitman, Blood Money.
[04:40.780 --> 04:41.780]  There's an opera level.
[04:42.180 --> 04:46.420]  But whenever you hear opera in a thing, they're just always going like...
[04:48.220 --> 04:50.740]  And I just thought that those were noises.
[04:51.140 --> 04:55.140]  I didn't know that you could translate that.
[04:55.420 --> 04:57.080]  Just a foreign language, dude.
[04:57.940 --> 05:00.440]  Yeah, man, they sound like this.
[05:01.220 --> 05:01.700]  What am I doing?
[05:02.900 --> 05:03.860]  What am I doing?
[05:05.200 --> 05:07.300]  I went up to Italy and they were just like...
[05:07.300 --> 05:08.560]  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, pizza.
[05:09.100 --> 05:11.380]  Well, I've never seen an English opera.
[05:13.180 --> 05:14.060]  It fucking...
[05:14.060 --> 05:18.000]  I wish you could see my face when I was watching Philadelphia for the first time.
[05:18.380 --> 05:19.600]  And that's how I learned this.
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.600]  There's a scene in that movie where Tom Hanks is playing opera for Denzel Washington.
[05:25.060 --> 05:28.640]  And he starts saying what is being sung in English, what the meaning is.
[05:28.960 --> 05:29.420]  And I was...
[05:29.420 --> 05:31.220]  It fucking blew my mind.
[05:31.660 --> 05:33.400]  You know what?
[05:34.160 --> 05:35.800]  It made me want to get more into opera.
[05:35.940 --> 05:39.400]  Because it seemed like there was quite a bit going on there as far as the story.
[05:40.320 --> 05:41.660]  Like a story, yeah.
[05:41.660 --> 05:43.640]  Yeah, but why is there English?
[05:43.720 --> 05:44.760]  Is there English opera?
[05:45.280 --> 05:45.420]  Sure.
[05:46.260 --> 05:46.980]  I've... really?
[05:48.720 --> 05:51.260]  Why is it always like just Italian people go...
[05:51.260 --> 05:55.800]  I mean, I think they invented it and that's where it's most popular.
[05:56.400 --> 05:57.500]  Um, okay.
[05:58.540 --> 06:00.600]  Can I just say thank you, Andrew?
[06:01.100 --> 06:01.900]  That's opera.
[06:02.340 --> 06:03.240]  Thank you, man.
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.860]  I don't think you could be closer to racism without going all the way in.
[06:09.860 --> 06:11.440]  No, I just thought it was...
[06:12.200 --> 06:13.360]  It's so loud.
[06:13.660 --> 06:17.220]  I wasn't gonna say anything, but you're totally right, Gavin.
[06:17.640 --> 06:19.160]  No, not at all.
[06:20.600 --> 06:21.280]  Oh, man.
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.980]  Anyway, I'm not stereotyping that.
[06:23.000 --> 06:23.700]  I just didn't know.
[06:24.200 --> 06:26.380]  You just keep doing an impression.
[06:26.580 --> 06:27.360]  You go, yeah, they're singing.
[06:28.280 --> 06:29.800]  It's not helping your case.
[06:29.900 --> 06:31.260]  Does it not sound like opera?
[06:33.380 --> 06:33.880]  No.
[06:36.500 --> 06:41.420]  It sounds like, um, sort of like five rows back from me at a football game.
[06:42.000 --> 06:42.240]  Yeah.
[06:42.820 --> 06:43.720]  Oh, yeah.
[06:44.240 --> 06:45.620]  You know what? That last one did.
[06:45.900 --> 06:46.180]  I'll agree.
[06:53.840 --> 06:56.740]  Is this what it sounds like to hang out with your grandpa, Gavin?
[07:01.520 --> 07:04.720]  This is the deleted scenes of that Skype commercial.
[07:05.540 --> 07:06.780]  It's the real shit.
[07:07.360 --> 07:08.720]  They kept them to get to stop singing.
[07:09.800 --> 07:14.000]  Anyway, I'm sure there are other people out there like me that didn't know that opera was words.
[07:14.200 --> 07:15.560]  All right, let's get a poll going.
[07:16.300 --> 07:21.080]  How many minds did Andrew just blow in the way that he thinks he blew them?
[07:22.240 --> 07:25.520]  We should just put up a poll that says, what language is opera?
[07:25.800 --> 07:27.940]  Italian or blah, blah, blah, blah.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.160]  Is Italian opera language or noise?
[07:32.420 --> 07:36.020]  That implies that I had an understanding it was language at all.
[07:36.020 --> 07:40.300]  As I said, I thought it was just supposed to be like emotional noises.
[07:42.420 --> 07:46.080]  What is the most what's the most emotional noise you've heard?
[07:48.500 --> 07:50.740]  That sounds like you're singing La Bamba.
[07:56.920 --> 07:57.980]  You're my favorite.
[07:58.600 --> 08:02.940]  Yeah, that's I mean, that's pretty special, man.
[08:03.020 --> 08:03.820]  That's pretty.
[08:04.500 --> 08:05.320]  I know it's special.
[08:05.320 --> 08:08.280]  I just learned that there's a whole fucking story to all these songs.
[08:08.740 --> 08:09.660]  I can go back.
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.780]  I can figure it out.
[08:10.820 --> 08:11.720]  You know what these are?
[08:12.340 --> 08:15.380]  I want to know what what's happening in the hitman blood money level.
[08:15.500 --> 08:16.800]  I want to know what those words are.
[08:17.120 --> 08:19.840]  That when when you like swap the gun and the shoots the guy.
[08:20.280 --> 08:20.920]  You could.
[08:21.020 --> 08:27.600]  Yeah, it's like a World War Two thing or something where it's you can swap the pistol and have them
[08:27.600 --> 08:30.420]  accidentally kill him on stage while they're performing.
[08:30.940 --> 08:34.100]  And then you could drop the chandelier on the guy when he's running over to like be
[08:34.100 --> 08:35.860]  oh my God to like react to it.
[08:36.260 --> 08:40.920]  I'd never even crossed my mind that there is a thing to translate there, but I need to go do that.
[08:42.240 --> 08:43.020]  And that's what I learned.
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.400]  I don't think I learned anything else.
[08:46.060 --> 08:46.880]  I had a question.
[08:48.360 --> 08:50.980]  When does the trail cease to be a trail?
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.620]  When do you just have a nut mix?
[08:54.420 --> 08:57.180]  What is the requirement of the trail for the trail mix?
[08:57.680 --> 09:01.200]  So so you don't lead off with you're talking about trail mix.
[09:01.400 --> 09:03.280]  It sounds like you're talking about a trail.
[09:05.500 --> 09:08.220]  Well, how wide does a trail get before it's a road?
[09:08.700 --> 09:10.300]  Right, that's what I thought he was getting at.
[09:11.440 --> 09:12.960]  What if it's just nuts?
[09:13.480 --> 09:15.280]  Well, I think that's got to be what it's from.
[09:15.420 --> 09:16.900]  It's got to be from people on trails.
[09:17.640 --> 09:19.620]  Well, yeah, that's how it was invented.
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.440]  It's like safe food to take with you on the trail that you can eat to get boosts of energy.
[09:24.700 --> 09:27.880]  But trail mix, it's like saying when is ice cream, not ice cream.
[09:28.020 --> 09:29.980]  It's as long as it exists, it's trail mix.
[09:30.440 --> 09:33.060]  But there's nut mixes that are certainly not trail mix.
[09:33.060 --> 09:34.280]  Or is it all trail mix?
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.380]  Oh, I see.
[09:37.320 --> 09:40.800]  So like, if it's just a bowl of nuts, that's that's not trail mix.
[09:40.900 --> 09:41.640]  There has to be other stuff.
[09:42.100 --> 09:46.260]  Like like if you take out croutons, is it still a Caesar salad?
[09:46.380 --> 09:49.240]  Yeah, just lettuce and it's just lettuce.
[09:49.460 --> 09:53.140]  Well, like, yeah, I feel like the dressing probably plays a big role there.
[09:53.340 --> 10:00.300]  But I was eating just the M&Ms out of my trail mix the other day and I devoured them.
[10:00.300 --> 10:04.080]  I don't think M&Ms were originally a part of trail mix.
[10:04.180 --> 10:08.120]  Also, if you're just eating the M&Ms out of your trail mix, you're just eating M&Ms.
[10:08.520 --> 10:09.660]  That's the dilemma.
[10:09.880 --> 10:11.800]  But there were like, I wasn't, though.
[10:11.860 --> 10:12.580]  It was trail mix.
[10:12.880 --> 10:15.300]  I don't think there's any hard and fast rule.
[10:15.640 --> 10:20.020]  It just says as long as you're adding equal parts of nuts, seeds and dried fruit,
[10:20.620 --> 10:21.520]  you're probably good.
[10:21.540 --> 10:24.060]  And then maybe a half part of chocolate chips.
[10:24.540 --> 10:26.940]  It's kind of like whatever you make it, I guess.
[10:26.980 --> 10:27.440]  That's fair.
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.240]  I was just curious if you guys had opinions because I wasn't sure what I was eating at
[10:31.240 --> 10:31.600]  that point.
[10:31.700 --> 10:35.880]  Once I finished all the chocolate, I was like, is this just a nut mix?
[10:36.200 --> 10:37.180]  There are there.
[10:37.420 --> 10:39.600]  We got raisins in the blend.
[10:39.860 --> 10:40.840]  No, is that enough?
[10:41.100 --> 10:43.280]  It's just what's left of the trail mix.
[10:43.760 --> 10:45.540]  What's a better mix, trail or Bombay?
[10:46.460 --> 10:47.720]  What's a Bombay mix?
[10:47.940 --> 10:48.760]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[10:49.040 --> 10:49.800]  Oh, man.
[10:49.980 --> 10:51.440]  It's so good.
[10:51.500 --> 10:52.360]  The Bombay mix.
[10:52.680 --> 10:53.740]  I don't trust it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.060]  If I don't know what it is and you're saying it's good.
[10:56.060 --> 10:59.100]  I don't trust the freaking shotgun in Gears of War.
[10:59.140 --> 11:00.560]  I don't trust a lot of things.
[11:00.940 --> 11:06.700]  Oh, this is like the this is like the weird trail mix where it's got like the other stuff.
[11:06.740 --> 11:07.180]  I got you.
[11:07.300 --> 11:07.680]  I got you.
[11:07.780 --> 11:10.860]  I don't think you're allowed to call Bombay mix weird trail mix either.
[11:11.100 --> 11:13.700]  This is just so culturally offensive.
[11:13.820 --> 11:14.520]  That's pretty offensive.
[11:15.900 --> 11:18.840]  I mean, this is good in a totally different way.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.320]  Like I wouldn't have said.
[11:20.420 --> 11:22.240]  I'd rather have trail mix than that, but it is good.
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.560]  Yeah, like there's no M&Ms in this.
[11:24.580 --> 11:25.100]  So what's the point?
[11:25.100 --> 11:26.560]  Oh, Nick just said it's fine.
[11:26.640 --> 11:27.260]  What does that mean?
[11:28.300 --> 11:28.960]  What do you mean?
[11:28.980 --> 11:30.080]  I don't think he likes it.
[11:30.500 --> 11:31.060]  It's fine.
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.140]  It's not as good as a regular trail mix.
[11:33.200 --> 11:34.920]  It's like spicy trail mix.
[11:34.980 --> 11:35.580]  It's amazing.
[11:35.660 --> 11:36.220]  It's incredible.
[11:36.520 --> 11:37.620]  I'm on the trail, though.
[11:37.660 --> 11:38.280]  It's going to be hot.
[11:38.840 --> 11:39.840]  I don't see any raisins.
[11:40.420 --> 11:42.100]  Yeah, I don't see chocolate.
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.040]  Yeah, like I don't want raisins in anything, to be honest.
[11:46.580 --> 11:46.900]  Really?
[11:46.980 --> 11:48.000]  You're not a raisin guy at all.
[11:48.160 --> 11:50.440]  Big part of trail mix, though, is it?
[11:51.560 --> 11:54.300]  I guess this is savory trail mix, and I could get behind that.
[11:54.300 --> 11:57.540]  Seems seems weird to have something hot and spicy when you're on a hike.
[11:58.260 --> 12:01.760]  Bits and bites is probably my preferred savory trail mix.
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.180]  Yeah, is that not a is that a Canadian thing?
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.840]  You have to post it.
[12:09.020 --> 12:12.660]  We're going to we're like six bags away from having a trail off.
[12:13.780 --> 12:19.740]  Bits and bites is you got the squares, you got the pretzel sticks, you got the Cheerios
[12:20.420 --> 12:22.160]  and you got little cheese sticks.
[12:22.840 --> 12:23.260]  Thank you.
[12:23.460 --> 12:23.600]  Bits and bites.
[12:24.340 --> 12:26.020]  Yeah, there's different variations.
[12:26.440 --> 12:26.880]  Breakfast in there.
[12:27.080 --> 12:27.660]  Oh, my God.
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.160]  Just like probably the stuff that fell off the conveyor belt of the cereal factory.
[12:36.400 --> 12:37.820]  No, it's it's we don't.
[12:37.940 --> 12:42.780]  The move is it's a bag of leftovers or delicious leftovers.
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.800]  First of all, leftovers are great.
[12:44.940 --> 12:47.740]  I just want to say that I feel like that was said in a negative tone.
[12:48.420 --> 12:51.220]  It's you can go and do a lot of good things, leftovers.
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.780]  But the move with the bits and bites is you get the pretzel stick and then you you cover
[12:57.780 --> 13:01.160]  it in the Cheerios, you fill it, you circle it.
[13:01.280 --> 13:03.980]  So it's end to end Cheerio and then you bite in that.
[13:04.100 --> 13:05.420]  And that's that's the spot.
[13:06.220 --> 13:07.060]  That's the move.
[13:07.720 --> 13:09.920]  I can't believe y'all don't have bits and bites.
[13:11.240 --> 13:13.380]  I wonder if it's called Mumbai mix now.
[13:16.280 --> 13:17.520]  You think they rebranded?
[13:17.980 --> 13:18.380]  I don't know.
[13:18.520 --> 13:19.820]  It's not Bombay anymore, is it?
[13:21.580 --> 13:23.280]  So is there a candy equivalent?
[13:23.660 --> 13:28.300]  This is the this is the culturally insensitive episode.
[13:28.660 --> 13:32.280]  I have found something called Mumbai mix, but I don't but it's not prevalent.
[13:32.980 --> 13:36.060]  Yeah, the most ever Bombay mix.
[13:36.080 --> 13:36.300]  Sorry.
[13:37.080 --> 13:41.000]  I wonder if you're ahead of the curve on that, Gavin, or if it's just never going to be.
[13:41.240 --> 13:44.080]  Yeah, I was just asking a genuine question.
[13:45.480 --> 13:47.880]  Andrew, you were saying what's the candy equivalent to the.
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.920]  I was curious if there is a candy trail mix.
[13:51.180 --> 13:52.820]  Have you seen candy salad?
[13:53.540 --> 13:54.720]  Well, yeah, I've seen those.
[13:54.940 --> 13:55.040]  Yeah.
[13:55.480 --> 13:55.680]  Yeah.
[13:55.700 --> 13:57.040]  People making those.
[13:57.720 --> 13:59.580]  Oh, it's like half of my worms and dirt.
[14:02.260 --> 14:04.100]  I don't understand what.
[14:04.260 --> 14:06.080]  So you make the candy salad.
[14:06.320 --> 14:08.800]  How do you then distribute the candy salad?
[14:09.520 --> 14:10.560]  Salad tongs.
[14:11.980 --> 14:14.280]  Like this big big spoon.
[14:15.100 --> 14:16.300]  Oh, but it's.
[14:16.980 --> 14:18.420]  How do you just hate that?
[14:18.820 --> 14:20.460]  I hate that so much that.
[14:20.600 --> 14:22.140]  Would you prefer like a chocolate tongue?
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.180]  I just don't want your fingers in my in my fingers.
[14:27.220 --> 14:28.000]  They're on the ball.
[14:28.480 --> 14:31.020]  There's no fingers in the in the candy.
[14:31.180 --> 14:32.440]  Look at that thumb.
[14:33.140 --> 14:38.500]  Anyone who can see the image of the show not touching that that thumb is on the inside
[14:38.500 --> 14:40.460]  and they are scooping that way.
[14:40.700 --> 14:43.420]  You cannot tell me that thumb is not getting in the mix.
[14:44.280 --> 14:46.420]  I mean, they should be using another spoon.
[14:46.720 --> 14:46.860]  Yeah.
[14:47.460 --> 14:49.120]  But I think that's fine.
[14:49.520 --> 14:56.100]  My issue is not necessarily what I meant is whenever I see these, there's 50 pounds of
[14:56.100 --> 15:00.660]  candy that they put into an open dish and then it's like, what are you going to do with it?
[15:00.720 --> 15:06.580]  Also, it's just layered in a way that you're not going to enjoy a mix of everybody's thing.
[15:06.880 --> 15:09.660]  You're just doing one section at a time.
[15:09.660 --> 15:14.240]  It is not like a variety where I feel like the joy of a trail mix is you get a little
[15:14.240 --> 15:16.280]  bit of peanut, get a little bit of cashew.
[15:16.580 --> 15:18.140]  Well, that's just depending on how it's mixed.
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.920]  I'm just telling you that if you toss your candy salad, it's probably fine.
[15:24.580 --> 15:26.420]  Do you toss your candy salad, Gavin?
[15:28.840 --> 15:33.500]  You're complaining about this with all the same issues that a regular salad has that
[15:33.500 --> 15:36.140]  we've solved hundreds of years ago by tossing it.
[15:37.100 --> 15:38.700]  It's no different than a salad.
[15:38.700 --> 15:41.860]  Use the same salad tongs and just mix it up.
[15:42.160 --> 15:43.660]  Not even salad, just mixing.
[15:43.820 --> 15:45.020]  It's the concept of mixing.
[15:45.540 --> 15:50.400]  Okay, first of all, I'm dealing with a bunch of candy amateurs over here is what it sounds like.
[15:50.720 --> 15:53.420]  You try mixing that gummy bowl.
[15:54.100 --> 15:54.720]  Good luck.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.060]  Give me that bowl, I'll mix that.
[15:57.060 --> 15:57.680]  With tongs?
[15:57.920 --> 15:58.400]  Easily.
[15:58.900 --> 15:59.380]  Easily.
[15:59.700 --> 16:00.620]  Oh my god.
[16:00.720 --> 16:01.980]  Yeah, I'll get you it could have mixed.
[16:02.080 --> 16:03.560]  No, it is, you do not.
[16:03.640 --> 16:06.080]  It is hard to mix a bowl of heavy gummy.
[16:07.160 --> 16:09.200]  I think you're greatly...
[16:11.000 --> 16:11.560]  You're insane.
[16:11.600 --> 16:13.840]  It's going to stick to each other.
[16:14.140 --> 16:15.800]  It's not going to want like a salad.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.420]  You can just throw that lettuce around and it bounces and different things hit it.
[16:21.280 --> 16:24.620]  Gummies have weight to them and they're hard to mix around.
[16:27.200 --> 16:29.240]  I could mix that so well.
[16:29.740 --> 16:30.280]  No, you couldn't.
[16:30.860 --> 16:33.360]  Next episode, bring the clip.
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.040]  You love bringing clips.
[16:35.040 --> 16:38.540]  Bring me a clip of you mixing a big bowl of candy.
[16:38.720 --> 16:39.680]  I don't want to buy all that junk.
[16:39.820 --> 16:40.600]  I hate eating it.
[16:40.700 --> 16:41.640]  It's just going to be wasted.
[16:42.120 --> 16:43.840]  Oh, yeah, I give it to Jeff.
[16:44.280 --> 16:45.580]  I can't eat any of that shit anymore.
[16:45.860 --> 16:46.200]  I'm not.
[16:46.340 --> 16:46.640]  I'm not.
[16:46.740 --> 16:47.900]  I got to take care of these teeth.
[16:48.300 --> 16:49.460]  Yeah, Nick, Eric.
[16:50.100 --> 16:51.320]  You want to eat my tossed salad?
[16:51.800 --> 16:52.360]  Nick's OK.
[16:52.500 --> 16:54.740]  There's got to stop saying that.
[16:54.960 --> 16:55.280]  Nick has a kid.
[16:55.280 --> 16:56.200]  No, that makes sense.
[16:56.900 --> 16:57.140]  What?
[16:57.860 --> 16:58.820]  You have a kid.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.200]  Your kid would love this.
[17:00.300 --> 17:01.980]  Come on, a kid would love a candy salad.
[17:02.220 --> 17:03.900]  Yeah, and he must be protected from this.
[17:03.900 --> 17:05.820]  Yeah, from defamination.
[17:06.320 --> 17:06.840]  Exactly.
[17:07.160 --> 17:11.040]  Yeah, if Nick's kid has this, he'll become Nick.
[17:11.360 --> 17:13.560]  And Nick has to do everything he can to stop that.
[17:13.840 --> 17:15.640]  And wake up tomorrow morning with monkey ears.
[17:16.060 --> 17:16.440]  Oh no!
[17:18.200 --> 17:23.880]  I never thought about Nick being like a fucking werewolf,
[17:24.120 --> 17:26.020]  like something happened to him at some point.
[17:26.660 --> 17:29.740]  And he's been cursed by this.
[17:29.980 --> 17:32.260]  Is that not the canon of 100% eat?
[17:32.260 --> 17:34.380]  Nick eats the food and becomes the monkey?
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.900]  Or is he just showing up as...
[17:35.900 --> 17:40.740]  I assume it's some sort of transformation, like barbecue-fueled monkeyism.
[17:41.180 --> 17:43.700]  No, that's literally Nick is just a man in a mask.
[17:43.780 --> 17:44.540]  That's all it is.
[17:44.740 --> 17:45.180]  Yeah.
[17:46.960 --> 17:49.600]  That's why we always made sure when we made merch,
[17:49.700 --> 17:51.580]  you always have to be able to see his human eyes.
[17:51.860 --> 17:54.140]  Because you have to remember there's a man in there.
[17:54.220 --> 17:54.480]  Yeah.
[17:56.220 --> 17:56.660]  Somewhere.
[17:57.220 --> 17:57.940]  A weird man.
[17:58.640 --> 17:59.440]  Yeah, oh definitely.
[17:59.680 --> 18:01.700]  So Jeff, you tossing any salads or what's going on?
[18:01.700 --> 18:03.680]  I want to know Jeff's favorite trail mix.
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.580]  What do we got in there?
[18:05.220 --> 18:06.120]  Oh, I don't give a shit.
[18:06.680 --> 18:09.200]  I'll be honest with you.
[18:09.260 --> 18:12.800]  I don't really care that much one way or the other about trail mix.
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.580]  It's hard for me to muster up even the pretend enthusiasm.
[18:19.480 --> 18:21.400]  I don't really give a shit about chocolate chips.
[18:21.540 --> 18:24.800]  So I guess I'd go butterscotch because I like that a little bit better.
[18:25.620 --> 18:27.880]  I like raisins, any kind of raisin.
[18:27.960 --> 18:29.380]  I'd actually over-index on raisins.
[18:29.460 --> 18:30.820]  I take the raisins nobody else wants.
[18:31.620 --> 18:35.960]  Sunflower seeds, maybe some pumpkin seeds, and then any form of nut.
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.400]  I don't like cashews, any other nut.
[18:38.000 --> 18:38.600]  Definitely peanuts.
[18:38.880 --> 18:40.740]  People fuck up and don't put enough peanuts.
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.220]  You don't like cashews?
[18:42.800 --> 18:44.120]  Nah, cashews are boring to me.
[18:44.240 --> 18:45.420]  It's a lower, it's a bottom tier nut.
[18:45.560 --> 18:46.460]  What about a pistachio?
[18:46.820 --> 18:47.740]  I like pistachios.
[18:47.960 --> 18:49.560]  I like all nuts but cashews.
[18:49.700 --> 18:51.320]  Cashews are a treat to me.
[18:51.380 --> 18:52.360]  Cashews are, yeah, they're delicious.
[18:53.140 --> 18:55.100]  Cashews is like, I'm not into it.
[18:55.700 --> 18:56.540]  I like your trail mix.
[18:56.740 --> 18:57.800]  They're like a creamy nut.
[18:58.400 --> 18:59.360]  They are a creamy nut.
[18:59.360 --> 19:03.100]  Yeah, it's like what you get on American Airlines flights when you want real nuts.
[19:03.220 --> 19:03.720]  I hate it.
[19:03.800 --> 19:05.580]  You're gonna have your creamy nut salad, Taz Gavin?
[19:05.720 --> 19:06.780]  Is that what we're getting at?
[19:07.060 --> 19:07.660]  We're getting some smut?
[19:07.680 --> 19:08.500]  Okay, all right.
[19:08.720 --> 19:09.900]  We get some smut in here?
[19:10.240 --> 19:12.460]  There's a certain era that we're heading back towards that I don't want to.
[19:12.660 --> 19:15.320]  Hey, you know what might happen this month or next month?
[19:16.120 --> 19:16.480]  What?
[19:16.880 --> 19:17.700]  It might be coming home.
[19:19.320 --> 19:19.680]  Oh!
[19:20.040 --> 19:20.800]  Do you really?
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.000]  Here's the thing.
[19:23.100 --> 19:25.680]  I want to ask you to do a stream of that again,
[19:25.860 --> 19:29.340]  but also I want you to be able to enjoy the thing that you want to enjoy.
[19:29.340 --> 19:31.860]  And not have to monetize everything that we do.
[19:32.040 --> 19:33.280]  We could all watch it together.
[19:33.700 --> 19:36.300]  I would love to watch that with you.
[19:36.440 --> 19:36.940]  I would love to.
[19:36.960 --> 19:37.460]  When is it?
[19:38.080 --> 19:40.240]  I think the final is going to be in July.
[19:40.740 --> 19:42.140]  Oof, that's a bad month for me.
[19:42.900 --> 19:43.620]  What does that mean?
[19:45.880 --> 19:46.900]  I'll get him to move it.
[19:48.820 --> 19:51.300]  Yeah, I hope it comes home.
[19:51.420 --> 19:53.060]  And I hope it comes home for the Celtics too,
[19:53.120 --> 19:55.240]  who I'm going to go see play this weekend for the NBA finals.
[19:55.240 --> 19:56.080]  That's crazy, dude.
[19:56.080 --> 19:56.740]  That's so cool.
[19:57.000 --> 19:57.760]  Yeah, I'm very excited.
[19:57.760 --> 20:00.380]  When I was in England just now, I promised...
[20:01.800 --> 20:05.240]  I promised my family if England won the Euros, I'd move back to England.
[20:07.120 --> 20:07.840]  You're insane.
[20:08.760 --> 20:10.060]  What are you doing?
[20:10.480 --> 20:11.640]  Okay, well done, buddy.
[20:11.840 --> 20:12.640]  Well, no, here, here.
[20:12.820 --> 20:14.000]  Is there a stature...
[20:14.000 --> 20:14.680]  Statue?
[20:14.880 --> 20:14.980]  What?
[20:15.120 --> 20:15.480]  Stature?
[20:15.580 --> 20:15.920]  Statue?
[20:16.680 --> 20:17.580]  Limitations on that?
[20:17.660 --> 20:18.440]  When do you have to do that?
[20:19.420 --> 20:20.300]  Like, when do I have to make a move?
[20:20.300 --> 20:21.640]  Like, you could do it 50 years from now, right?
[20:21.720 --> 20:23.280]  Like, and you're still fulfilling the obligation.
[20:23.540 --> 20:25.620]  I wasn't specific on timeline, I guess, but...
[20:25.620 --> 20:26.520]  Yeah, well, that's fine.
[20:26.740 --> 20:27.160]  It did...
[20:27.160 --> 20:28.720]  I feel like that changes nothing.
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.700]  I did shake on it.
[20:32.160 --> 20:33.280]  Legally binding now.
[20:33.480 --> 20:35.360]  Who did you make this bet with?
[20:35.420 --> 20:36.700]  What's the other half of the bet?
[20:37.520 --> 20:38.260]  Yeah, what do you win?
[20:39.880 --> 20:42.820]  He's not allowed to ever visit again if they lose.
[20:43.740 --> 20:45.020]  I've gone about this the wrong way.
[20:45.220 --> 20:47.820]  I just made a bet with my siblings and my family.
[20:48.400 --> 20:49.620]  What's their team again?
[20:50.320 --> 20:50.820]  How about this?
[20:51.020 --> 20:53.780]  You tell your brother you'll move back to England when he does.
[20:55.080 --> 20:55.980]  Yeah, I want...
[20:56.620 --> 21:01.120]  I'm just imagining you and your family dining room cutting a Chael Sutton promo against England.
[21:01.300 --> 21:01.660]  England!
[21:02.200 --> 21:04.000]  You absolutely suck!
[21:04.720 --> 21:07.500]  You win, I move back here.
[21:07.780 --> 21:11.500]  You lose, I'll never visit again.
[21:11.740 --> 21:13.540]  Apparently the odds are pretty good, though.
[21:13.620 --> 21:14.980]  It's like a really strong team.
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.820]  I don't think it matters based on what you've said.
[21:18.960 --> 21:21.400]  I'm gonna have to record this at 9pm every Thursday.
[21:21.860 --> 21:23.180]  Oh my god!
[21:23.800 --> 21:24.360]  Oh man.
[21:25.160 --> 21:26.580]  God, we're gonna have to find another British person.
[21:26.940 --> 21:28.680]  Eric, can you put an ad in the...
[21:28.680 --> 21:30.460]  I don't know, do we put Craigslist, I guess?
[21:30.660 --> 21:31.180]  Do people still do that?
[21:31.180 --> 21:32.240]  Is that where you want me to put it?
[21:32.280 --> 21:34.180]  You want me to put an ad for a British person in Craigslist?
[21:34.280 --> 21:35.100]  Or like Indeed?
[21:35.300 --> 21:36.140]  Do people use Indeed?
[21:36.560 --> 21:37.360]  Is that what we do?
[21:37.420 --> 21:38.180]  Monster.com?
[21:38.240 --> 21:38.680]  How do you do it?
[21:38.700 --> 21:41.920]  Why don't we just shoot Toad in the hole first and then we'll get some contact.
[21:42.040 --> 21:42.520]  Oh, okay.
[21:42.640 --> 21:46.320]  We'll have to try some different British people on and then whoever Gavin hates the most for
[21:46.320 --> 21:47.780]  being British will have...
[21:47.780 --> 21:48.600]  Oh, is there any British person?
[21:48.720 --> 21:49.980]  What's James Buckley up to?
[21:50.080 --> 21:50.580]  Can we get him?
[21:51.740 --> 21:52.500]  He's a busy guy.
[21:54.020 --> 21:55.900]  Do people still use Craigslist?
[21:57.240 --> 21:58.440]  Uh, I think so.
[21:58.460 --> 22:04.120]  If you need to buy a used car or some shitty furniture, I think that's it.
[22:04.540 --> 22:08.820]  I've been on a Denzel Washington movie kick where I just have been putting his name into
[22:08.820 --> 22:13.300]  streaming services and then watching whatever pops up and the end...
[22:13.300 --> 22:19.760]  I had never seen any of the Equalizer films and the end of the first Equalizer sets up
[22:19.760 --> 22:23.300]  him becoming a crime fighter through Craigslist.
[22:23.480 --> 22:25.640]  And I thought that was fucking insane.
[22:25.940 --> 22:32.420]  I feel like, and I could be completely wrong, that Craigslist is not nearly as like a known
[22:32.420 --> 22:34.040]  thing anymore or is used.
[22:34.560 --> 22:39.400]  And I may be feeling that way because of how shitty the UI and just design of that website
[22:39.400 --> 22:39.900]  is.
[22:40.500 --> 22:44.740]  But he was like, he made an ad on Craigslist that was like, hey, you need help.
[22:44.840 --> 22:46.260]  And the person's like, yeah, I need help.
[22:46.320 --> 22:48.920]  And it ends with him replying like, I got you, bro.
[22:48.920 --> 22:52.180]  And then they wrap it up and they never address it again.
[22:52.240 --> 22:52.900]  It doesn't come up.
[22:53.160 --> 22:55.480]  He has a new system in the second film.
[22:55.960 --> 22:57.000]  But when did that movie come out?
[22:57.620 --> 22:58.460]  That's a great question.
[22:58.660 --> 23:00.180]  Maybe like 2010-ish?
[23:00.360 --> 23:01.420]  Well, there you go.
[23:01.480 --> 23:02.720]  That's the age of Craigslist.
[23:03.100 --> 23:03.460]  Really?
[23:03.540 --> 23:05.700]  I thought the age of Craigslist was like 2000.
[23:06.940 --> 23:07.660]  No, really?
[23:07.840 --> 23:08.200]  No.
[23:08.320 --> 23:08.520]  Okay.
[23:08.680 --> 23:13.160]  I found like the first house that I moved out to on Craigslist, the car that I bought
[23:13.160 --> 23:15.500]  on Craigslist, the other car that I bought on Craigslist.
[23:15.500 --> 23:24.800]  In 2000, we were just starting to switch from like alt.binaries.austin.forsale or whatever
[23:26.540 --> 23:28.660]  on newsgroups over to Craigslist.
[23:28.840 --> 23:30.240]  We were just we were just making the transition.
[23:30.900 --> 23:35.180]  I think I thought that because Craigslist looks like all of those websites.
[23:35.440 --> 23:37.520]  It looks like it was made at that time.
[23:37.580 --> 23:40.600]  Like, it looks like the guy that made Ask Jeebs
[23:40.600 --> 23:43.860]  then immediately went on to make the Craigslist site.
[23:46.300 --> 23:48.700]  Like, there's no thrill... frills?
[23:49.820 --> 23:50.240]  Frills?
[23:50.520 --> 23:50.940]  Thrills?
[23:51.480 --> 23:51.900]  Frills.
[23:52.140 --> 23:52.500]  Frills.
[23:52.880 --> 23:54.420]  It's a no frills kind of site.
[23:54.700 --> 23:55.140]  Yeah, for sure.
[23:55.380 --> 23:57.080]  There are plenty of thrills, though.
[23:57.300 --> 23:57.980]  If you just...
[23:57.980 --> 23:58.280]  Oh, God.
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.020]  You don't have to go that far.
[24:00.140 --> 24:00.600]  A lot of thrills.
[24:00.620 --> 24:02.960]  You could get Tinsel Washington to fuck up a dude on that site.
[24:03.140 --> 24:03.700]  It's crazy.
[24:04.720 --> 24:06.160]  Well, 14 years ago, you could.
[24:06.820 --> 24:07.040]  Yeah.
[24:07.120 --> 24:07.380]  You could.
[24:07.480 --> 24:08.900]  Yeah, 10 years ago.
[24:10.400 --> 24:12.960]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.600]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[24:17.060 --> 24:18.840]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[24:19.060 --> 24:22.260]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[24:22.460 --> 24:26.720]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[24:26.980 --> 24:30.440]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[24:30.860 --> 24:32.700]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[24:35.860 --> 24:37.180]  Hey, it's Paris.
[24:37.640 --> 24:39.780]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[24:40.040 --> 24:40.820]  Like stars.
[24:41.260 --> 24:41.560]  Duh.
[24:41.560 --> 24:45.680]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[24:46.300 --> 24:50.600]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[24:51.060 --> 24:55.300]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.340]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[24:58.860 --> 24:59.560]  That's hot.
[25:00.220 --> 25:03.260]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[25:03.640 --> 25:04.960]  Hilton for the stay.
[25:05.600 --> 25:06.800]  What have you been up to, Jeff?
[25:07.860 --> 25:10.000]  Man, I had a bunch of stuff.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.220]  I had a new idea that I think is going to revolutionize the world.
[25:15.300 --> 25:19.760]  I had a cute little thing that I discovered recently that I wanted to share with y'all.
[25:19.760 --> 25:20.360]  No, go back. Go back to that.
[25:20.480 --> 25:21.080]  Hang on. No, no, no.
[25:21.380 --> 25:25.940]  No, we have to keep going because there's even stuff that Jeff said,
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.940]  you'll never believe what I did again.
[25:28.340 --> 25:29.380]  Oh, yeah.
[25:30.160 --> 25:31.860]  And I don't know what that is either.
[25:32.220 --> 25:36.180]  Well, I had two very embarrassing things happen to...
[25:36.180 --> 25:37.060]  Well, I shouldn't say happen to me.
[25:37.100 --> 25:39.360]  I did two very embarrassing things to myself recently.
[25:39.720 --> 25:41.480]  So those are two different stories I could tell.
[25:41.600 --> 25:42.760]  I don't know that we need to though.
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.160]  We already had one really embarrassing story with Andrew
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.200]  admitting that he's racist against Italians in the opera.
[25:49.060 --> 25:52.360]  And so I just, I don't want to over-index on embarrassing.
[25:52.500 --> 25:55.120]  So maybe we'll shelve those and save them for down the road or something.
[25:55.760 --> 25:56.460]  Mario's pretty cool.
[25:58.320 --> 26:00.400]  I want to know what you put it in the Slack.
[26:00.480 --> 26:01.720]  I want to know what you did again.
[26:01.720 --> 26:03.660]  Yeah, you told us that you would show us.
[26:03.680 --> 26:04.660]  You put it in the Slack. You teed it up.
[26:04.940 --> 26:06.360]  Because here are things that have happened before.
[26:06.680 --> 26:08.020]  You've shit yourself.
[26:08.020 --> 26:08.780]  Yeah.
[26:09.040 --> 26:11.640]  I don't think you'd be embarrassed about sharing.
[26:11.860 --> 26:12.880]  You've broken a tooth.
[26:13.960 --> 26:16.080]  Here, I'm going to put a video up that Emily took.
[26:16.200 --> 26:16.860]  This is yesterday.
[26:17.240 --> 26:17.680]  Oh my God.
[26:18.560 --> 26:19.240]  Oh no.
[26:22.300 --> 26:24.860]  You've got to be kidding me.
[26:26.440 --> 26:27.920]  Dude, come on.
[26:28.040 --> 26:28.520]  How?
[26:30.420 --> 26:32.480]  Why do you keep doing this?
[26:34.240 --> 26:37.340]  So if you've watched the video at home, you probably haven't seen the video.
[26:37.340 --> 26:39.500]  You're reattaching a gas hose.
[26:39.500 --> 26:40.290]  It's dropping it.
[26:41.360 --> 26:42.520]  Gas, Olivia.
[26:42.980 --> 26:44.400]  Oh my God.
[26:44.560 --> 26:47.260]  I got covered in gas.
[26:47.760 --> 26:49.160]  You've got to stop doing it.
[26:49.220 --> 26:50.980]  You've got to stop driving away.
[26:51.380 --> 26:52.220]  So yesterday...
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.440]  How is this happening?
[26:55.540 --> 26:56.440]  What did you do?
[26:56.700 --> 26:57.500]  Fucking A, man.
[26:58.260 --> 26:59.480]  What's your problem?
[27:02.680 --> 27:03.340]  How?
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  So yesterday I stopped at a gas station with my wife and daughter and we
[27:12.140 --> 27:14.180]  started filling up Emily's car.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.300]  I'm proud to say this has never happened in my car.
[27:17.400 --> 27:18.380]  I'm always driving her car.
[27:18.900 --> 27:22.720]  We were filling up Emily's car and we decided to go in for Slurpees.
[27:23.100 --> 27:25.180]  And then it just took a long time inside.
[27:25.340 --> 27:29.340]  We were getting snacks and when we came all out, we all just jumped in the car and drove away.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.460]  And then I heard a kathunk.
[27:30.460 --> 27:33.700]  And then Emily and Millie said, Oh my God, no.
[27:34.020 --> 27:39.640]  And I stopped and I backed up and I looked and I had driven away with the gas hose still in the car.
[27:40.120 --> 27:45.620]  And this time stuck around to see that I ripped it out of the gas pump.
[27:47.040 --> 27:49.600]  Shot gas all over myself.
[27:50.300 --> 27:55.400]  I tried to put it back together, but the pressure from all the gas coming out just shot it back out
[27:55.400 --> 27:55.700]  at me.
[27:56.060 --> 27:59.840]  And then I went inside and I had to stand in line while the lady looked at me,
[28:00.320 --> 28:01.400]  stinking of gas.
[28:01.640 --> 28:03.560]  And then she said, she didn't even say anything to me.
[28:03.620 --> 28:05.160]  I said, um, I made a mistake.
[28:05.420 --> 28:11.320]  And she just pointed to a little dude who had a bucket, like a trash can full of cat litter.
[28:11.320 --> 28:13.900]  And he just like shrugged for me to follow him.
[28:13.940 --> 28:18.900]  And he just walked up and he threw some cat litter down and he stuck it back in
[28:18.900 --> 28:21.860]  and twisted it and then it reconnected.
[28:21.880 --> 28:23.320]  And he said, OK, you're good.
[28:23.720 --> 28:25.540]  And I went, this happens a lot, huh?
[28:25.560 --> 28:26.520]  And he said, no.
[28:32.200 --> 28:33.100]  That's so good.
[28:33.700 --> 28:38.140]  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt because this can happen to anyone.
[28:38.460 --> 28:39.360]  It does happen.
[28:39.620 --> 28:40.100]  It sucks.
[28:40.220 --> 28:40.860]  It does happen.
[28:41.140 --> 28:41.780]  And that's OK.
[28:42.320 --> 28:44.780]  Jeff, you're parked at the gas pump.
[28:45.500 --> 28:48.940]  Like, you're like, oh, yeah, this took a long time for us to get slurpees.
[28:49.540 --> 28:50.560]  I'll go one further.
[28:52.780 --> 28:59.200]  I didn't do it at the same gas station, but I was next door to the same gas station.
[28:59.280 --> 29:00.100]  I did it at last time.
[29:00.100 --> 29:02.880]  Like the gas station share a parking lot in an L.
[29:03.020 --> 29:05.140]  I've got to ask, like, what's changed?
[29:05.400 --> 29:06.740]  Is it it's not a new car?
[29:06.980 --> 29:10.420]  No, here's here's what I think it is, because there was a lot of discussion dissecting it
[29:10.420 --> 29:11.300]  for the rest of the day.
[29:14.820 --> 29:23.820]  The prevailing idea is that I have been so stressed out by rooster teeth closing
[29:24.420 --> 29:28.960]  and starting up regulation and my daughter graduating high school and my daughter going
[29:28.960 --> 29:29.880]  off to college.
[29:30.240 --> 29:33.900]  And the other thing that we had that has been going on behind the scenes that we haven't
[29:33.900 --> 29:37.760]  ever talked about yet, which is that I moved in the process of this.
[29:37.980 --> 29:41.560]  I didn't want to talk about it until my house sold because I don't want to jinx myself.
[29:41.860 --> 29:46.000]  But the day after I found out Rooster Teeth was closing, I put my house on the market,
[29:46.260 --> 29:47.260]  not in a desperation move.
[29:47.320 --> 29:49.500]  I explained it all in in Soul All Right this week.
[29:49.560 --> 29:53.220]  It was it was a very tactical and smart move to try to create some flexibility in my life
[29:53.220 --> 29:56.800]  so that we could, you know, if we found a house in Michigan someday, we could find it.
[29:56.800 --> 30:02.180]  But so in the process of Rooster Teeth closing down and starting all this, I was showing
[30:02.180 --> 30:06.960]  my house off to people and living in like a model home and throwing away half of everything
[30:06.960 --> 30:09.820]  I have and then trying to find a new home.
[30:09.980 --> 30:15.180]  And then the day that we were set to sign the lease on the new home, we lost it to somebody
[30:15.180 --> 30:15.520]  else.
[30:15.700 --> 30:19.280]  And then so there was a period where we didn't have a place to live and we had to find a place
[30:19.280 --> 30:19.660]  to live.
[30:19.720 --> 30:20.320]  And then we did.
[30:20.380 --> 30:21.200]  And then we had to move.
[30:21.260 --> 30:22.320]  And that was excruciating.
[30:22.400 --> 30:23.640]  And I'm still dealing with selling the house.
[30:23.640 --> 30:26.880]  It's just been so much going on in my head.
[30:27.000 --> 30:32.160]  I think I'm just over... I think I'm just overtaxed mentally.
[30:33.460 --> 30:33.940]  I think.
[30:34.580 --> 30:36.580]  Or I'm losing my fucking mind.
[30:36.740 --> 30:41.240]  I think that completely explains the first instance of this occurring.
[30:41.360 --> 30:42.580]  I fully agree with that one.
[30:42.980 --> 30:46.740]  I think this was just a simple case of slurpy enthusiasm.
[30:47.100 --> 30:48.880]  I'm not done with all this stuff, though.
[30:49.440 --> 30:54.020]  We were leaving the other house after getting the air conditioner fixed,
[30:54.120 --> 30:57.300]  because in the process of selling my other house while it's under contract,
[30:57.440 --> 31:00.440]  the fucking A.C. went out and I had to go over and spend 48 hours getting it fixed.
[31:00.700 --> 31:02.340]  So it's like I'm still dealing with that stuff.
[31:02.480 --> 31:05.700]  I think I'm just... but I was also having a fun conversation with Emily and Millie,
[31:05.780 --> 31:06.280]  and they forgot.
[31:06.660 --> 31:07.060]  Yeah.
[31:07.400 --> 31:07.800]  So...
[31:07.800 --> 31:12.800]  How is it 2024 and there's no like buzzer when your car is penetrated?
[31:14.400 --> 31:15.440]  That's a good question.
[31:15.560 --> 31:16.380]  I don't know.
[31:16.380 --> 31:17.220]  I don't know.
[31:17.220 --> 31:19.640]  You shouldn't be able to drive away with that in at this point.
[31:19.680 --> 31:23.000]  I just I'm going to never I've never I didn't I've never done it in my life.
[31:23.080 --> 31:25.400]  And then suddenly I've done it twice in the span of about three weeks.
[31:25.480 --> 31:27.580]  And how many times do you think you'll do it?
[31:28.380 --> 31:29.680]  Hope never again.
[31:29.840 --> 31:30.860]  Never fucking again.
[31:30.900 --> 31:32.920]  So that's one embarrassing thing I did.
[31:32.980 --> 31:38.060]  I will say, by the way, something we wanted to talk about way back in the day when I got
[31:38.060 --> 31:43.540]  some people thought inordinately annoyed with Andrew for sending a thousand clocks to my house.
[31:44.100 --> 31:47.520]  The day they were supposed to arrive was the day my house went on sale.
[31:48.860 --> 31:52.520]  I had an open house that day at like 11 a.m.
[31:52.520 --> 31:56.400]  and they were supposed to show up in the driveway, a pallet full of clock.
[31:56.840 --> 31:58.440]  That's why I was freaking out.
[31:58.500 --> 32:00.620]  And I was like, please don't send it to my house right now
[32:00.620 --> 32:02.360]  because it was going to ruin my life.
[32:02.820 --> 32:03.840]  Yeah, I started it.
[32:03.960 --> 32:05.900]  First, I wish we had those clocks now.
[32:05.960 --> 32:06.760]  That's the first thing I'll say.
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.660]  Second thing I'll say is that I didn't know that you were doing that.
[32:10.780 --> 32:13.000]  I learned in the act of that conversation.
[32:13.920 --> 32:14.820]  That you were moving.
[32:15.940 --> 32:17.120]  Or else I wouldn't have considered it.
[32:17.280 --> 32:19.600]  But the missiles had already been, I think, sent.
[32:20.040 --> 32:21.500]  Yeah, the missiles were already fired.
[32:22.080 --> 32:22.880]  Yeah, but it was fine.
[32:23.340 --> 32:24.100]  A crisis was averted.
[32:24.240 --> 32:25.220]  It was all good.
[32:25.400 --> 32:29.580]  It was just it was just very, very, very funny timing.
[32:29.800 --> 32:31.180]  That's why in the episode you can hear Gavin go,
[32:31.360 --> 32:33.700]  Andrew, you know why he can't have them right now.
[32:35.160 --> 32:36.340]  I should have sent them to Gavin.
[32:36.480 --> 32:37.080]  That's what I should have done.
[32:37.440 --> 32:39.740]  I should have never put you in line of fire.
[32:40.140 --> 32:41.280]  No, no, no, it's fine.
[32:41.340 --> 32:42.540]  I love being in the line of fire.
[32:42.540 --> 32:45.980]  It was just it was a fucking perfect timing, that's all.
[32:46.220 --> 32:49.960]  I think we need to create something or you need to establish a rule
[32:50.460 --> 32:53.820]  that you are not allowed to leave until your car is filled.
[32:54.720 --> 32:55.980]  Because I think that's the problem.
[32:56.060 --> 33:00.640]  If you just stayed there through the whole act, then you're freed up.
[33:00.780 --> 33:01.120]  Like, I don't know.
[33:01.340 --> 33:01.880]  Oh, I see.
[33:02.020 --> 33:02.380]  I see.
[33:02.460 --> 33:04.820]  I can't walk away from the pump until it's returned.
[33:05.220 --> 33:05.800]  Yeah, I should.
[33:05.940 --> 33:06.380]  You know what?
[33:06.400 --> 33:06.780]  That's a good.
[33:06.840 --> 33:07.420]  I'll take that.
[33:07.600 --> 33:08.140]  I'll take that note.
[33:08.180 --> 33:11.460]  There needs to be like you made the wrist pocket like a gas pocket
[33:11.460 --> 33:14.440]  where like you have to cuff yourself to the thing.
[33:14.800 --> 33:18.300]  So if you physically leave, it's getting pulled out with you at least.
[33:18.380 --> 33:20.720]  I'm going to endeavor just not to physically leave.
[33:20.820 --> 33:24.740]  But if I can't adhere to that, then that's I'll invent something.
[33:24.820 --> 33:25.460]  But I think you're right.
[33:25.500 --> 33:27.140]  I think that's the that's the solution.
[33:27.240 --> 33:31.480]  I shouldn't trust myself to walk inside of a gas station while it's still pumping outside
[33:31.480 --> 33:35.760]  because something there's a breakdown in communication in my brain that happens on the way out.
[33:36.060 --> 33:37.240]  And it's yeah.
[33:38.500 --> 33:43.080]  I view it as like a Borderlands game and I'm just making the numbers go up.
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.680]  And then I realize I have to pay what that number is and the game becomes a lot less fun.
[33:46.900 --> 33:49.540]  But watching the numbers go up is always good.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.200]  I'm imagining it like every time you enter or exit a building,
[33:53.260 --> 33:55.400]  it's like memento and you don't know what's just happened.
[33:55.720 --> 33:58.560]  So it's like, am I chasing this guy or is he chasing me?
[33:58.680 --> 33:59.220]  Yeah, kind of.
[33:59.360 --> 33:59.620]  Yeah.
[33:59.940 --> 34:00.820]  What was I doing?
[34:01.140 --> 34:02.240]  I'm a bit of a guy, Pierce.
[34:02.580 --> 34:03.600]  Better drive off.
[34:04.340 --> 34:08.760]  The other embarrassing thing I did to myself, I actually did last week
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.240]  and I fucked it up in the episode when we were recording Regulation.
[34:13.980 --> 34:17.780]  Right before we recorded last week, I went through...
[34:17.780 --> 34:19.740]  I had some spare time and I've been...
[34:19.740 --> 34:21.840]  I've just been having like fun making thumbnails lately.
[34:21.940 --> 34:25.840]  It's just been really kind of rewarding and insane for me.
[34:26.200 --> 34:27.000]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[34:27.080 --> 34:28.500]  But I've just... I've really been embracing it.
[34:28.520 --> 34:30.900]  And I always enjoyed it when we were doing F*** Face as well.
[34:31.520 --> 34:33.220]  But it was always like a last minute thing.
[34:33.220 --> 34:35.780]  And so when we found out we were shutting down,
[34:36.020 --> 34:38.640]  we didn't make thumbnails for the last like 12 episodes.
[34:38.800 --> 34:39.440]  Didn't see the point.
[34:39.980 --> 34:44.080]  And it's been bugging me on YouTube any time I go to our channel
[34:44.080 --> 34:47.080]  and I see all those last few episodes with no thumbs.
[34:47.160 --> 34:49.460]  So I went back the other day, like last Wednesday or something,
[34:49.960 --> 34:55.500]  and I just created thumbnails for the final like three months of F*** Face episodes
[34:55.500 --> 34:56.760]  and put them all up just so it looks...
[34:57.920 --> 34:58.320]  Intentionally...
[34:58.320 --> 34:59.580]  It looks like it's supposed to, right?
[34:59.980 --> 35:03.140]  And after that, I was kind of bummed because I was like on such a roll
[35:03.140 --> 35:06.260]  I was like, man, I wish I could record the next episode of regulation.
[35:06.580 --> 35:09.700]  I'm like, I wish I could do the next episode of regulations thumbnail now,
[35:09.800 --> 35:12.140]  but I can't because we haven't recorded the episode yet.
[35:12.220 --> 35:12.860]  That's impossible.
[35:13.100 --> 35:14.620]  And I thought, is it?
[35:15.000 --> 35:15.900]  Is it impossible?
[35:16.340 --> 35:20.080]  Like, what if I just figured out what we're going to talk about
[35:20.660 --> 35:25.180]  and then I just try to create a thumbnail based around that?
[35:25.240 --> 35:28.420]  And then I thought, well, that's too hard to nail
[35:28.420 --> 35:29.860]  because we go in so many different directions.
[35:29.860 --> 35:31.920]  But what I can control is what I talk about.
[35:31.920 --> 35:34.980]  So I was like, why don't I just come up with something to talk about
[35:34.980 --> 35:36.180]  that's thumbnail worthy?
[35:36.460 --> 35:38.640]  And then I can make the thumbnail now.
[35:39.340 --> 35:42.200]  And then in the episode, when it's over, I can be like,
[35:42.300 --> 35:44.160]  oh, by the way, I already have the thumbnail for this.
[35:44.360 --> 35:47.200]  And if I'm going to do this, I should record the whole process.
[35:47.280 --> 35:49.320]  And I'll make a piece of supplemental content
[35:49.320 --> 35:51.320]  where I'm creating a...
[35:51.320 --> 35:53.980]  Coming up with a subject to talk about,
[35:54.280 --> 35:55.740]  then creating the thumbnail for it,
[35:55.800 --> 35:58.960]  and then giving myself the goal of in the episode,
[35:59.120 --> 36:01.120]  naturally bringing this subject up
[36:01.120 --> 36:03.160]  so that then I can transition into it.
[36:03.240 --> 36:04.160]  And then the thumbnail is done.
[36:04.220 --> 36:05.520]  And then I can talk about it at the end of the episode
[36:05.520 --> 36:06.600]  or never talk about it
[36:06.600 --> 36:08.480]  and just release the supplemental content, right?
[36:09.800 --> 36:12.060]  So I was like, well, what am I going to fucking talk about?
[36:12.300 --> 36:14.280]  So I thought, here's what I'll do.
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.680]  I'll go to random.org and I'll put in all the subjects
[36:17.680 --> 36:19.020]  from Trivial Pursuit.
[36:19.720 --> 36:21.100]  The main five subjects from Trivial Pursuit.
[36:21.300 --> 36:22.340]  And then I'll randomize it.
[36:22.380 --> 36:23.320]  And whatever comes up with,
[36:23.400 --> 36:24.940]  then I'll do research on that topic.
[36:25.200 --> 36:26.920]  So here I am hoping I get like entertainment
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.340]  or sports or something, right?
[36:29.000 --> 36:29.920]  And I get fucking...
[36:29.920 --> 36:30.620]  So confused.
[36:31.860 --> 36:34.040]  Why wouldn't you just make a thumbnail about a gas pump?
[36:34.920 --> 36:35.900]  Well, that hadn't happened yet.
[36:36.860 --> 36:40.480]  No, but I also feel like it's bound to happen.
[36:41.340 --> 36:42.880]  That's what I thought you were going to get, Gavin.
[36:42.940 --> 36:43.880]  It's going to happen again.
[36:43.980 --> 36:45.080]  Just get that gas pump ready.
[36:47.120 --> 36:49.180]  The gas pump thing happened yesterday, dude.
[36:49.240 --> 36:49.900]  This is last week.
[36:51.820 --> 36:53.780]  It was less than 24 hours ago.
[36:53.800 --> 36:54.580]  The gas pump thing happened.
[36:55.320 --> 36:57.840]  So anyway, I start doing research in...
[36:57.840 --> 36:59.520]  I landed on science, unfortunately.
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.980]  I was like, oh, I got to come up with a funny science thumbnail.
[37:02.300 --> 37:06.400]  So I started doing research on the wildest things to happen in science in 2024.
[37:07.220 --> 37:10.440]  And the best I could come up with is that there's a...
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.800]  They just are about to release 4 billion mosquitoes into the wild
[37:15.800 --> 37:21.820]  that are genetically altered so that any lady mosquitoes they have sex with,
[37:21.900 --> 37:24.360]  they make eggs, but the eggs don't ever hatch.
[37:24.500 --> 37:26.400]  And it's supposed to kill out all the mosquitoes, right?
[37:26.880 --> 37:28.260]  Or control the population.
[37:28.260 --> 37:29.440]  The genophage.
[37:29.900 --> 37:31.680]  Yeah. And I thought, like, that's kind of funny.
[37:32.280 --> 37:35.200]  Maybe I could talk about how unintended consequences,
[37:35.400 --> 37:38.260]  like they release 4 billion mosquitoes out that when they have sex,
[37:38.380 --> 37:39.380]  they basically create...
[37:42.200 --> 37:43.240]  They ruin society.
[37:43.380 --> 37:44.300]  And I was like, yeah, you know,
[37:44.320 --> 37:44.760]  unintended consequences.
[37:44.860 --> 37:45.960]  What if it transfers to humans?
[37:46.260 --> 37:48.460]  We just have a bunch of dudes that every time they fuck,
[37:48.540 --> 37:49.440]  now nobody else can have kids.
[37:50.180 --> 37:50.880]  But then, or I got...
[37:50.880 --> 37:52.580]  Or I thought, like, maybe I could go this way and talk about...
[37:52.580 --> 37:53.500]  Think about, like, not...
[37:53.500 --> 37:55.340]  Is it enough to just make the mosquitoes?
[37:55.820 --> 37:57.180]  Should they also be hot?
[37:57.180 --> 38:00.080]  Like, did they have to make hot, like, George Clooney mosquitoes
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.900]  that all the lady mosquitoes would be into, right?
[38:02.920 --> 38:05.120]  And then they wouldn't want to bang these dudes, right?
[38:05.580 --> 38:05.880]  Mosquitoes?
[38:05.880 --> 38:06.940]  I don't know why I keep saying it like that.
[38:07.440 --> 38:09.420]  And so anyway, I was like, that's funny.
[38:09.620 --> 38:11.100]  I can work that out.
[38:11.180 --> 38:13.180]  And so I'm recording all this live,
[38:13.260 --> 38:15.520]  going through the random.org, figuring it all out.
[38:15.540 --> 38:16.760]  It's like a 20 minute video.
[38:17.080 --> 38:19.540]  I make the thumbnail for episode four,
[38:19.640 --> 38:21.940]  which is like a mosquito with a knife and a fork.
[38:21.980 --> 38:22.700]  And I'm like, perfect.
[38:22.820 --> 38:24.540]  Now all I got to do is talk about it in the episode.
[38:24.540 --> 38:28.320]  And then after we recorded the episode, I was eating dinner.
[38:28.760 --> 38:31.060]  And I thought, oh shit, I never talked about it.
[38:31.140 --> 38:33.900]  That is totally fucking wasted now.
[38:34.140 --> 38:37.980]  There's no point in ever releasing any of this content.
[38:38.140 --> 38:39.780]  So I made a whole fucking supplemental thing
[38:39.780 --> 38:42.160]  and then just completely slipped my mind
[38:42.160 --> 38:43.620]  when we were recording last week.
[38:43.940 --> 38:45.820]  And I just forgot about it.
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.840]  You do realize we do this every week.
[38:48.340 --> 38:50.080]  Yeah, but it's not the same thing.
[38:50.240 --> 38:51.040]  It's not the same.
[38:51.100 --> 38:51.680]  It's not the same.
[38:51.760 --> 38:52.220]  It's ruined.
[38:52.340 --> 38:52.780]  It's ruined.
[38:52.860 --> 38:53.400]  I would know.
[38:53.460 --> 38:54.020]  It's fine.
[38:55.400 --> 38:56.340]  But we wouldn't.
[38:56.420 --> 38:58.040]  I feel like the point is we don't know.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.440]  I don't see how it would have been any different.
[39:00.580 --> 39:02.880]  I wouldn't have been any different at all.
[39:02.900 --> 39:03.680]  I would have known.
[39:04.300 --> 39:06.100]  But you would always have known.
[39:06.220 --> 39:07.420]  I'm not too really new anyway.
[39:07.720 --> 39:08.860]  You always know.
[39:09.320 --> 39:10.800]  Yeah, but if I hadn't fucked it up,
[39:10.840 --> 39:12.260]  I could be excited about it and proud of it.
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.700]  And be like, yeah, here's an idea.
[39:13.920 --> 39:15.040]  But I fucked it up.
[39:15.100 --> 39:16.560]  And so now I just like, I can't even must...
[39:16.560 --> 39:17.080]  I can't even lie.
[39:17.080 --> 39:17.980]  I can't lie to you guys.
[39:18.080 --> 39:19.920]  I can't like try to pull it off.
[39:20.600 --> 39:21.880]  I'm too honest with you.
[39:22.360 --> 39:25.060]  And it's probably funnier that I botched it.
[39:25.320 --> 39:28.700]  You know, that I fucking put my foot in my own asshole
[39:28.700 --> 39:32.000]  instead of just releasing a piece of content that I...
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.140]  Can we please release the supplemental anyway?
[39:34.420 --> 39:36.780]  Because I feel like you're probably really excited about it.
[39:37.040 --> 39:37.500]  Oh, yeah.
[39:37.620 --> 39:40.280]  I'm so into my idea and I think it's so clever.
[39:40.280 --> 39:43.760]  So we are going to release the Mosquitio content or not?
[39:44.460 --> 39:45.840]  I think we have to.
[39:45.880 --> 39:46.220]  I recorded it.
[39:46.220 --> 39:46.860]  I think we must.
[39:48.740 --> 39:49.760]  I don't know when.
[39:49.900 --> 39:50.060]  Yeah.
[39:50.220 --> 39:51.640]  We should do that relatively soon.
[39:52.180 --> 39:54.560]  Is it like you blindsided yourself?
[39:54.940 --> 39:55.380]  Kind of.
[39:55.540 --> 39:56.020]  It sounds like.
[39:56.300 --> 39:56.460]  Kind of.
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.260]  Exactly like I blindsided myself.
[39:58.480 --> 39:58.660]  Yeah.
[40:00.180 --> 40:02.820]  It's like those Mosquitios are going to get blindsided with a kitchen knife.
[40:02.820 --> 40:08.800]  I was so fucking excited to do this.
[40:08.800 --> 40:09.820]  Talk about the Mosquitios.
[40:10.120 --> 40:10.480]  Yeah.
[40:12.820 --> 40:13.980]  Yeah, I really was.
[40:14.220 --> 40:17.140]  I thought you were just going to drop this week's thumbnail into the Discord.
[40:17.260 --> 40:19.320]  Yeah, I thought 100%.
[40:19.320 --> 40:21.140]  Yeah, I thought it was about to happen and we were all going to go.
[40:21.140 --> 40:21.860]  I'm excited.
[40:22.620 --> 40:23.580]  I'm looking for it.
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.280]  You fucked yourself.
[40:24.500 --> 40:25.520]  I can't find it.
[40:26.220 --> 40:27.020]  Oh no.
[40:27.940 --> 40:29.600]  No, we can't even find it.
[40:29.660 --> 40:31.600]  It's not like a great thumbnail.
[40:31.740 --> 40:34.420]  Could the Mosquitio thumbnail be this week's thumbnail?
[40:35.100 --> 40:37.860]  I mean, now I guess it could, but it'd be better.
[40:38.060 --> 40:38.780]  It sounds like you don't want it.
[40:38.820 --> 40:40.260]  Yeah, but it sounds like you don't want it to be.
[40:40.440 --> 40:42.060]  Probably funnier if it was the gas pump.
[40:42.160 --> 40:45.980]  I like the idea of the thumbnail for this being a subject we didn't talk about.
[40:46.340 --> 40:50.800]  The thumbnail for this being that says episode four when it's episode five too.
[40:51.620 --> 40:52.100]  Oh.
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.260]  Well, I can't find it.
[40:55.260 --> 40:56.860]  It's in my Photoshop file.
[40:57.380 --> 40:58.480]  Anyway, that's how I'm dumb.
[40:59.080 --> 41:00.080]  I'm dumb in those two ways.
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.120]  I'm surprised that you didn't just bank a story that you were happy with.
[41:04.300 --> 41:06.900]  I love that you pursued it the way you did.
[41:07.360 --> 41:09.100]  Now it's just such an interesting approach.
[41:09.300 --> 41:14.260]  The exploration of the idea was the interesting part to me.
[41:14.420 --> 41:18.180]  Not creating a thumbnail ahead of time to save time.
[41:18.520 --> 41:21.620]  It was more of like, it would be funny if I could make this happen.
[41:22.540 --> 41:24.080]  And then I thought it was a clever idea.
[41:24.260 --> 41:26.820]  And then I couldn't make it happen because I'm stupid.
[41:27.140 --> 41:28.320]  And I'm my own worst enemy.
[41:28.640 --> 41:30.320]  And then that's kind of par for the course.
[41:30.540 --> 41:35.080]  And so instead of trying to re-kajigger it in the future to make it work in some way,
[41:35.120 --> 41:36.540]  I'd rather just be honest and be like,
[41:36.580 --> 41:37.060]  Hey, look at this.
[41:37.320 --> 41:38.760]  Look how fucking stupid Jeff is.
[41:39.180 --> 41:40.920]  Thought he was smart for about seven minutes.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.400]  But it turns out he's dumber than ever.
[41:43.780 --> 41:45.020]  You know, that kind of thing.
[41:45.020 --> 41:53.080]  See, to me, the intense, scary moment of the bit that you're saying is the story not landing as hoped.
[41:53.340 --> 41:57.340]  Like if it just doesn't deliver the way that you thought it would, that would be my concern.
[41:57.820 --> 42:01.500]  More so than like the discovery of it and the searchability.
[42:02.120 --> 42:08.420]  More, you are really putting your flag down that this is going to be a memorable part of this episode.
[42:08.800 --> 42:11.460]  And if it doesn't land, it just doesn't work.
[42:11.920 --> 42:13.140]  Now, see, that's not a problem for me
[42:13.140 --> 42:17.940]  because I have enough of an ego that I'm confident in my ability to land the story.
[42:21.300 --> 42:23.580]  Unless it's about a horse, right?
[42:23.640 --> 42:26.300]  I may not land the story like they don't all land.
[42:26.440 --> 42:28.260]  I definitely botched the horse down the mountain,
[42:28.380 --> 42:32.320]  but I had confidence going in that I would do it, you know, like I'm like,
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.780]  I'm like a I'm like a 85 to 90% free throw shooter.
[42:37.960 --> 42:39.820]  I'm you know, chances are I'm going to hit the big one.
[42:39.820 --> 42:40.740]  Yeah.
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.120]  Part of this show is you just talking about like you're just burying yourself with things
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.460]  that I haven't thought about in years or never would have known at all.
[42:52.500 --> 42:53.740]  He brought it up. He brought the...
[42:53.740 --> 42:58.120]  The thing I like about Jeff's confidence is I feel like a lot of the times
[42:58.120 --> 43:00.800]  the miss isn't as present to us as it is you.
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.660]  The horse hill story we were totally happy with and...
[43:04.660 --> 43:06.240]  Yeah, no, no, no, I'm my own worst enemy,
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.400]  but I do feel like most of the time my my misplaced confidence works out.
[43:11.600 --> 43:14.900]  Like, remember when I hit a I hit all the home runs like nobody thought I'd do that.
[43:15.040 --> 43:17.260]  But then like, no, you believed in myself and then it worked.
[43:17.620 --> 43:19.120]  So I just tend to believe in myself.
[43:19.280 --> 43:22.320]  I just shouldn't always. And I recognize that.
[43:22.500 --> 43:25.300]  But it's easier to believe in yourself than not believe in yourself.
[43:25.400 --> 43:31.300]  So, you know, I hadn't hit a baseball in 20 years when we fucking did that day.
[43:31.340 --> 43:33.140]  I just assumed it would work and it did.
[43:33.600 --> 43:37.260]  I wonder, did you play a lot of baseball growing up?
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.340]  Uh, like backyard baseball every day, but never like on a team or anything.
[43:41.400 --> 43:43.840]  OK, never mind then. I was going to say, I wonder, like
[43:43.840 --> 43:47.640]  in your overall all time life hitting ball stats,
[43:48.340 --> 43:53.040]  how much like if you looked at it on a chart, just did you did you hit more
[43:53.040 --> 43:55.540]  in that time period than you had as a kid?
[43:55.960 --> 44:01.400]  No, no, but I hit it. It was a lot. It was a consolidated amount of hits.
[44:01.400 --> 44:05.700]  Let me tell you guys about a good idea I had, though, that is a good idea.
[44:05.840 --> 44:07.880]  I think that I won't fuck up. All right.
[44:08.460 --> 44:12.320]  Last night I was doing that thing where I was going through my pantry
[44:12.320 --> 44:15.740]  and I was looking for something to eat, a snack.
[44:16.040 --> 44:19.440]  And, you know, like somewhere after somewhere, like after 8 p.m.,
[44:19.440 --> 44:21.400]  everything in your house looks like dog shit,
[44:21.780 --> 44:24.780]  even if you were really excited about it at like 6 p.m. when you bought it.
[44:25.440 --> 44:28.520]  But like for like 8 p.m. to whenever you go to bed, you're like,
[44:28.540 --> 44:30.960]  suddenly you're like, I don't want this. Why the fuck do I have this?
[44:30.960 --> 44:33.440]  There's nothing in my house to eat. I don't like anything, right?
[44:35.160 --> 44:37.240]  And it's only because it's your shit, right?
[44:38.260 --> 44:42.040]  What if you were able to flag something on an app that said like I'm available
[44:42.040 --> 44:45.640]  and then like whenever you get up for a snack, like let's say it's 9 p.m.,
[44:45.640 --> 44:48.220]  you go to your pantry and your fridge, nothing looks good.
[44:48.360 --> 44:50.600]  You toggle your app. It says I'm available.
[44:50.920 --> 44:53.540]  You get a ding. Somebody else toggled their app.
[44:53.620 --> 44:59.920]  It then says, hey, for the next 30 minutes, you and this stranger can switch kitchens.
[44:59.920 --> 45:02.300]  And then you drive to his house and he drives to your house
[45:02.300 --> 45:06.700]  and you can raid his kitchen for 30 minutes and he can raid your kitchen for 30 minutes.
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.140]  Whatever the fuck you want. And then when the timer's off, you just go home
[45:10.140 --> 45:12.620]  because you do because you want stuff to eat.
[45:12.760 --> 45:13.940]  You just don't want your stuff.
[45:14.180 --> 45:15.860]  But somebody else's stuff is fucking great.
[45:15.980 --> 45:19.380]  And your stuff has value just to everybody but you.
[45:19.580 --> 45:22.420]  So why not? Let's just like do it with our neighbors.
[45:22.580 --> 45:24.720]  Why not just go over to your neighbor's house at 9 30 tomorrow night,
[45:24.760 --> 45:25.880]  knock on the door and say, go to my house.
[45:25.940 --> 45:27.200]  I'll go to I'm going to hang out in your kitchen.
[45:27.200 --> 45:30.040]  I'll meet you back here in 30 minutes and we'll both be happier.
[45:30.380 --> 45:33.540]  I feel like I wouldn't even necessarily need to raid the other pantries.
[45:33.660 --> 45:35.320]  I just want inspiration sometimes.
[45:35.520 --> 45:38.480]  Yeah, like I just want to look through and just take notes and be like,
[45:38.620 --> 45:39.900]  oh, I want to order some of this.
[45:39.960 --> 45:40.880]  I'm going to go and get some of that.
[45:41.300 --> 45:43.640]  Now, are we talking like you're binge?
[45:43.720 --> 45:47.780]  You have 30 minutes or whatever and you can consume as much as you want.
[45:47.800 --> 45:50.000]  Or is it like you got to pick an item?
[45:50.300 --> 45:53.720]  You're not trying to I assume you're not trying to like.
[45:54.860 --> 45:57.300]  Take advantage of somebody's kitchen.
[45:57.460 --> 45:59.960]  I think you just like you just really want a snack,
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.060]  but all you have are like, I don't know,
[46:06.660 --> 46:10.860]  goldfish crackers and pretzel sticks and some string cheese.
[46:10.880 --> 46:12.680]  And that's you don't want any of those things.
[46:12.680 --> 46:16.280]  But your neighbor might have some, I don't know, peanut butter crackers.
[46:16.400 --> 46:17.560]  They're like, I wish I had those.
[46:17.620 --> 46:18.620]  So now you can't.
[46:18.660 --> 46:22.140]  My my brain immediately goes to survivor
[46:22.140 --> 46:25.780]  when they sometimes have these challenges where if you win,
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.420]  you get to go to the other tribe's beach and steal one of their items.
[46:30.860 --> 46:32.660]  But you tell them what you're taking.
[46:33.200 --> 46:35.760]  And it's like a thing where they're like, I hope they don't take this.
[46:36.060 --> 46:39.080]  The idea of like you get to go to your neighbor's house
[46:39.080 --> 46:42.440]  and have to decide, are you going to eat the steak that they just made
[46:42.440 --> 46:44.160]  and leave them with like nothing?
[46:44.260 --> 46:45.200]  I think it's so funny.
[46:45.580 --> 46:48.700]  The idea to be fair, your neighbor toggled that it was available.
[46:48.840 --> 46:50.200]  Yeah, they don't want to share that steak.
[46:50.260 --> 46:51.340]  They shouldn't hit that on the app.
[46:52.400 --> 46:54.460]  That's it would always be a consensual steak.
[46:55.200 --> 46:56.740]  The doors are open on both sides.
[46:56.860 --> 47:01.400]  It's not a thing where like you get one toggle a year and you get to decide
[47:01.400 --> 47:04.500]  when that is and the other person who's opted in as well
[47:04.500 --> 47:07.560]  doesn't get to choose when that one hit happens.
[47:08.040 --> 47:08.880]  No, I don't think so.
[47:08.940 --> 47:11.240]  I think it's just like you just flag yourself as available
[47:11.240 --> 47:13.420]  for anybody that's looking to snack swap.
[47:13.900 --> 47:16.880]  I think it would make streets less wasteful, too.
[47:17.440 --> 47:17.940]  I agree.
[47:18.360 --> 47:19.320]  I totally agree.
[47:20.060 --> 47:20.860]  More stuff would get eaten.
[47:20.860 --> 47:21.580]  I like this idea.
[47:21.580 --> 47:22.100]  Yeah.
[47:23.720 --> 47:24.460]  Snack swap.
[47:24.620 --> 47:26.180]  What if we all just did it with each other?
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.820]  Well, then we would just be hanging out all the time, which I'm totally okay with.
[47:32.620 --> 47:34.420]  We should just put all our names in a bowl
[47:34.420 --> 47:38.600]  and then you pick out whose pantry you're going for and then we'll just take it evening.
[47:40.200 --> 47:43.460]  Why can't I find this stupid mosquito?
[48:13.900 --> 48:17.900]  This episode is brought to you by Nespresso Virtual Coffee Machines.

[48:36.980 --> 48:38.780]  Visit Nespresso.com to shop now.
[48:40.280 --> 48:40.880]  Oh, there he is.
[48:40.880 --> 48:47.640]  I, uh, your idea, Jeff, it's sort of similar to an idea I had that I don't know how to make work.
[48:48.140 --> 48:52.860]  But the best naps are always naps when you've agreed to do something,
[48:53.140 --> 48:56.540]  but you just don't feel like like you you're obligated to go do this thing,
[48:56.580 --> 49:01.100]  but you're comfy and you can have a nap and just, oh man, I would so love to have a nap right now.
[49:01.200 --> 49:05.560]  If there was a way to convince yourself that you could sleep through
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.880]  like one of those instances without any consequences and that it was actually all okay,
[49:10.880 --> 49:15.640]  that that this isn't real, but you think it is, I would pay so much for that.
[49:16.360 --> 49:20.640]  Like a fake meeting type thing that I'm skipping by having this nap.
[49:21.320 --> 49:22.920]  I don't know what you just said.
[49:24.380 --> 49:25.360]  Have you ever?
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.280]  Okay, let me let me translate.
[49:29.900 --> 49:36.200]  Have you ever laid in bed and you see the cheese coming down the hill?
[49:37.420 --> 49:39.080]  He's doing a round of accents today.
[49:39.380 --> 49:41.920]  Does everyone else here know what Andrew just said?
[49:42.160 --> 49:42.360]  No.
[49:43.580 --> 49:44.360]  That's a no from me.
[49:44.360 --> 49:45.820]  I have no idea.
[49:45.880 --> 49:46.880]  I do not understand.
[49:47.300 --> 49:48.880]  I figured it was just okay.
[49:48.920 --> 49:51.080]  Jeff found the stupid thumbnail.
[49:51.320 --> 49:53.380]  I like my thumbnail.
[49:54.220 --> 49:56.320]  It's just a cute little mosquito.
[49:58.400 --> 50:01.760]  Let's say it is 1 p.m.
[50:02.000 --> 50:02.780]  It's 1 p.m.
[50:03.240 --> 50:10.240]  And you agreed previously that you're going to go do something at 2 p.m.
[50:10.680 --> 50:11.820]  And you're relaxed.
[50:11.880 --> 50:12.960]  You're laying down.
[50:13.360 --> 50:14.020]  You're cozy.
[50:14.740 --> 50:16.540]  And it's like, oh, man, you know what?
[50:16.560 --> 50:18.380]  I made this obligation beforehand.
[50:18.820 --> 50:22.900]  But in a world in which I had no plans, a nap would be so good right now.
[50:23.220 --> 50:24.120]  This would be so great.
[50:24.460 --> 50:30.400]  I feel like the best naps are always in those instances where you have to you can't nap
[50:30.400 --> 50:32.340]  because you have an obligation you need to fulfill.
[50:32.740 --> 50:33.760]  So you can't do it.
[50:33.780 --> 50:38.360]  So you have to go to the thing like a pre-commitment nap, pre-commitment nap.
[50:38.360 --> 50:47.620]  I want a service that makes me believe that I have one of those that I can sleep through,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.600]  but there's no actual consequence.
[50:51.240 --> 50:53.760]  How would this service manifest itself?
[50:54.360 --> 50:56.520]  That is the problem that I've had.
[50:56.860 --> 50:58.180]  You just want a feeling.
[50:59.140 --> 51:03.500]  Well, I want I want like something to feed me fake meetings.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.260]  But the issue is is I know they're fake.
[51:08.260 --> 51:10.400]  I need to somehow not know that these are fake.
[51:10.600 --> 51:15.640]  I mean, if you want, I could we could just go about our lives the next month.
[51:15.860 --> 51:18.440]  And one of the things I put in your calendar will be fake.
[51:18.780 --> 51:21.200]  No, because I won't know which one it is.
[51:21.260 --> 51:22.460]  And that will just make me more anxious.
[51:22.640 --> 51:23.560]  Like, that's the problem.
[51:23.940 --> 51:25.220]  I need to somehow.
[51:25.660 --> 51:27.160]  Wait, so you need to know.
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.440]  I need to feel it's real for the nap.
[51:33.460 --> 51:36.000]  But it's because I don't want to miss the meeting.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.180]  I want to spend time with you.
[51:39.300 --> 51:40.640]  That would take priority.
[51:41.480 --> 51:46.160]  But that a nap is absolutely enhanced by these situations.
[51:46.280 --> 51:49.320]  Like it is more appealing, at least to me.
[51:49.660 --> 51:54.260]  And that is the problem is there's not a world in which I can both believe I'm actually
[51:54.260 --> 52:00.660]  skipping this meeting while also like knowing that it's fake.
[52:01.180 --> 52:03.540]  I don't get the joy of like, you know what?
[52:03.560 --> 52:05.320]  I actually don't have anything I have to do.
[52:05.320 --> 52:09.660]  I can sleep because then I feel bad because I'm missing the get together.
[52:09.720 --> 52:13.140]  So you want it to be fake, but you want to feel like it's real.
[52:13.440 --> 52:13.860]  Yes.
[52:14.020 --> 52:18.200]  I need it to be fake, but I need to simultaneously feel it's real.
[52:18.700 --> 52:23.200]  I think it would be funnier just to sign you up for a bunch of different appointments and
[52:23.680 --> 52:24.120]  consultations.
[52:24.360 --> 52:28.080]  Not to know that, Jeff, you may have cracked the code.
[52:28.560 --> 52:33.080]  If it's stuff I don't care about for things that I have zero interest in with people I
[52:33.080 --> 52:35.460]  don't know, that might be the move.
[52:35.740 --> 52:38.100]  But if it's low stakes, why would you even worry about it?
[52:38.560 --> 52:43.380]  Because I feel like I'm like if it's you and I are supposed to hang out and then I slept
[52:43.380 --> 52:46.620]  through it, I'd feel like I let you down just for how I am.
[52:46.640 --> 52:49.420]  And I'd be like, oh, man, I wish I would have been able to hang out with Gavin.
[52:49.920 --> 52:51.720]  Well, just give me a PS5 and it will be forgiven.
[52:53.440 --> 52:54.820]  I'd rather just show up.
[52:55.680 --> 52:57.200]  And that wouldn't solve my guilt.
[52:57.660 --> 52:59.600]  I wouldn't be able to buy my guilt away like that.
[52:59.740 --> 53:00.240]  I don't know.
[53:00.260 --> 53:01.540]  That's not how my feelings work.
[53:02.540 --> 53:03.940]  I like Jeff's idea a lot.
[53:04.100 --> 53:07.600]  I'm going to, oh, I'm going to sign up for so many things that I'm not going to show
[53:07.600 --> 53:07.900]  up to.
[53:08.060 --> 53:14.880]  Like, we could have like that, like a carpet cleaner consultation, window blind.
[53:15.560 --> 53:19.040]  Yeah, you're going to get like all the quotes in the world, but never pay.
[53:19.040 --> 53:19.720]  No, I can't.
[53:19.780 --> 53:21.460]  I don't want to waste people's time.
[53:21.460 --> 53:22.060]  Sierra Club.
[53:22.820 --> 53:24.440]  So it has to be like group.
[53:24.600 --> 53:26.320]  I'm just like a yoga class.
[53:26.320 --> 53:31.840]  I don't understand what is going on for the last.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.120]  It must be 10 minutes of the show.
[53:34.340 --> 53:38.680]  So when you want, you want a feeling that, you know, is real.
[53:38.820 --> 53:42.840]  Both a Schrodinger's feeling of real and fake at the same time.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.580]  Andrew, Andrew, so you can take up what you think is a pretty good nap.
[53:47.920 --> 53:49.720]  Well, it enhances the nap.
[53:50.020 --> 53:50.440]  Okay.
[53:50.580 --> 53:52.380]  It's like the sequel to Inception.
[53:53.060 --> 53:55.000]  It's like I see hot in your nap.
[53:55.480 --> 53:57.860]  Have you never been in that scenario where you're like, man,
[53:57.880 --> 54:02.080]  this would be such a great fucking nap right now, but I can't because I have an obligation.
[54:02.300 --> 54:03.240]  I've never felt.
[54:03.420 --> 54:06.320]  No, no, never in my life.
[54:06.460 --> 54:10.520]  You're describing a feeling that I can't chase because I don't know that it exists.
[54:11.160 --> 54:11.800]  Here's the thing.
[54:12.100 --> 54:16.580]  If we were to also do a poll about that, there are more people that feel that way
[54:16.580 --> 54:19.280]  than didn't know that opera had words.
[54:19.280 --> 54:26.160]  I got I got to say just because the people who listen to this feel that way does not
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.260]  mean I'm listening to them for advice on.
[54:28.440 --> 54:29.100]  No, that's fair.
[54:29.160 --> 54:29.980]  At all.
[54:30.120 --> 54:34.840]  Are you saying that regulation listeners are a poor barometer of the human race?
[54:34.860 --> 54:38.440]  Well, what I mean, one of the hosts of this show didn't know what Italian was,
[54:38.460 --> 54:39.160]  so I don't know.
[54:39.500 --> 54:44.620]  I mean, I think the hosts are a poor barometer.
[54:45.360 --> 54:46.740]  So you know what I mean?
[54:46.740 --> 54:48.160]  Yeah. So what's up, Jeff?
[54:48.200 --> 54:49.460]  You going to take a nap or not?
[54:50.080 --> 54:51.660]  I know I don't want to get in trouble.
[54:54.400 --> 54:58.240]  So after all that, Andrew, what would be a suitable appointment
[54:58.980 --> 55:01.420]  that you could not before and potentially miss?
[55:02.460 --> 55:07.780]  Uh, I think like a group activity that you think is real, but no, isn't real.
[55:08.580 --> 55:10.400]  No, it is.
[55:11.260 --> 55:15.400]  Here's the problem is that in all of these contexts, these are people I care about.
[55:16.740 --> 55:17.800]  Well, no, let me explain.
[55:18.020 --> 55:20.980]  I'm trying to explain this this this thought process.
[55:21.680 --> 55:24.520]  It's always if I have a meeting or I'm supposed to hang out with someone,
[55:24.580 --> 55:25.440]  I care about them.
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.080]  I don't want to disappoint them.
[55:27.760 --> 55:31.720]  If it is a group of people I don't know or care about,
[55:31.860 --> 55:34.920]  I'm OK, disappointing this random group activity.
[55:35.320 --> 55:36.180]  Who don't you like?
[55:36.360 --> 55:38.880]  Well, let's schedule some group activities with people you don't care about.
[55:38.880 --> 55:39.520]  Let us know.
[55:39.600 --> 55:42.760]  Get us a list of people you hate and we'll put it on the calendar.
[55:43.360 --> 55:43.720]  Yeah.
[55:45.260 --> 55:46.620]  I want to help you out here.
[55:46.780 --> 55:48.720]  I want to help you achieve your ultimate nap.
[55:48.940 --> 55:52.600]  Say you were about to guest on a podcast that you didn't care about.
[55:53.500 --> 55:53.740]  OK.
[55:54.840 --> 55:55.200]  Yeah.
[55:55.820 --> 55:58.480]  Uh, well, I'm trying to think.
[55:59.400 --> 56:00.920]  Just think of a podcast you don't care about.
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.280]  Well, that's not true, because sometimes I care about the people,
[56:05.320 --> 56:06.440]  even if I don't care about them.
[56:06.500 --> 56:07.680]  Yeah, but these are people you don't care about.
[56:08.720 --> 56:11.160]  I don't know anyone.
[56:11.620 --> 56:14.540]  You're going to be disappointing them when you don't show up for bowling
[56:14.540 --> 56:16.300]  or whatever activity it is.
[56:16.440 --> 56:19.680]  You're set to appear on on how it's done in an hour.
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.060]  No, that would be a problem.
[56:21.160 --> 56:21.860]  Nobody didn't know.
[56:22.060 --> 56:27.840]  That's that's you're taking that with my I feel like I'm a guest in that scenario
[56:27.840 --> 56:34.300]  and that like there's some expectation where if I sign up for like bowling Sundays,
[56:34.840 --> 56:36.260]  nobody's going to care if I don't show up.
[56:36.340 --> 56:37.080]  I don't know any of these people.
[56:37.160 --> 56:38.080]  These people don't know me.
[56:38.420 --> 56:40.360]  You don't think they miss you from the bowling team?
[56:40.360 --> 56:41.380]  No, because I'm not.
[56:41.560 --> 56:42.280]  I've never been there.
[56:42.540 --> 56:48.460]  I think that's what I need to do is start signing up for like group activities that don't matter,
[56:48.500 --> 56:52.440]  that will continue and happily exist regardless of my presence.
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.500]  And to them, there's like not even a face to the name.
[56:54.820 --> 56:56.180]  There's not even a face to the name.
[56:56.240 --> 56:58.140]  It's not like I'm failing on them.
[56:58.700 --> 56:59.180]  I got it.
[56:59.180 --> 57:00.140]  This is OK.
[57:00.260 --> 57:00.720]  I got it.
[57:01.100 --> 57:07.140]  You need to go down to your local library or your local bookstore and you need to join a book club.
[57:08.680 --> 57:11.360]  Oh, oh, that's the move, Jeff.
[57:11.540 --> 57:11.760]  Yeah.
[57:11.840 --> 57:13.380]  I should have consulted with you earlier.
[57:13.700 --> 57:18.600]  You need to join a book club that meets every Tuesday at 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. or whatever.
[57:18.600 --> 57:20.160]  And then you start that.
[57:20.900 --> 57:22.660]  You plan your naps right before that.
[57:23.320 --> 57:27.440]  What if you signed up online for one of those like seminars at the Apple store?
[57:27.720 --> 57:28.300]  You could learn.
[57:28.740 --> 57:30.300]  You could learn like Final Cut.
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.820]  No, the thing about here's the thing I like about signing up for the book club is I can
[57:35.820 --> 57:38.700]  get multiple. It's not even just I'm missing the meeting.
[57:39.060 --> 57:42.140]  I could be in bed and be like, oh, I'm supposed to read this book.
[57:42.220 --> 57:44.960]  But yeah, you can procrastinate.
[57:45.320 --> 57:47.260]  You've got a week of procrastination.
[57:47.460 --> 57:49.360]  You can dole out whatever you feel like.
[57:49.440 --> 57:50.340]  Oh, this is good.
[57:50.460 --> 57:51.820]  I'm going to Google one right now.
[57:52.980 --> 57:53.580]  Book clubs.
[57:55.020 --> 57:56.820]  I don't even need them to be my area.
[57:56.900 --> 57:57.620]  I'm not showing up.
[57:57.800 --> 57:58.560]  It doesn't matter.
[57:59.440 --> 58:01.900]  This is so stupid because you know so much.
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.320]  If it's not even in your area, you would never even intend to go.
[58:05.320 --> 58:06.200]  It's so pointless.
[58:06.340 --> 58:07.180]  I don't understand this.
[58:07.380 --> 58:08.400]  I'm back with Eric.
[58:08.700 --> 58:12.140]  I mean, I should be in your area.
[58:12.360 --> 58:14.120]  There needs to be local stakes.
[58:14.380 --> 58:14.560]  Yeah.
[58:15.220 --> 58:15.560]  Okay.
[58:15.920 --> 58:17.180]  June book club meeting.
[58:17.340 --> 58:18.280]  Three spots left.
[58:18.480 --> 58:19.720]  Signing up right now.
[58:19.720 --> 58:20.180]  There you go.
[58:20.220 --> 58:20.560]  You're set.
[58:20.920 --> 58:21.280]  Perfect.
[58:22.040 --> 58:25.200]  Dude, you're going to sleep like a baby.
[58:25.380 --> 58:28.920]  No, he's going to feel so guilty that you're going to end up reading the damn book and
[58:28.920 --> 58:29.360]  go it.
[58:29.400 --> 58:30.240]  Oh, 100 percent.
[58:30.320 --> 58:30.780]  100 percent.
[58:30.780 --> 58:37.400]  Uh, I don't think I'm actually allowed to go to this book club, so I got to pick a different
[58:37.400 --> 58:37.860]  one.
[58:38.000 --> 58:38.800]  Why not?
[58:38.900 --> 58:40.480]  Are you banned from that one?
[58:41.900 --> 58:46.060]  It's named gender specifically in a way that does not fit me.
[58:47.960 --> 58:48.200]  Is it?
[58:48.300 --> 58:49.540]  Is it an Italian book club?
[58:49.580 --> 58:50.820]  Because they you are no longer.
[58:51.680 --> 58:53.620]  No, I love Italy.
[58:54.380 --> 58:55.220]  I'm a big chicken.
[58:55.260 --> 58:56.940]  Parmesan, probably my favorite food.
[58:57.500 --> 58:57.980]  Parmesan.
[58:57.980 --> 59:01.820]  Did you once go in there and say that you can't read books and then you had to leave?
[59:04.320 --> 59:05.340]  No, I can read.
[59:09.440 --> 59:10.880]  Throw some words at me right now.
[59:11.000 --> 59:11.640]  Fucking proof it.
[59:12.080 --> 59:12.980]  Whenever you want.
[59:14.800 --> 59:16.840]  You want me to say a word and see if you read it?
[59:18.180 --> 59:19.040]  Put it in the chat.
[59:19.600 --> 59:20.580]  Read that shit all day.
[59:23.300 --> 59:23.660]  Mosquititos.
[59:25.100 --> 59:25.580]  Damn it.
[59:25.780 --> 59:26.620]  I was copying.
[59:26.620 --> 59:29.040]  I was copying and pasting that right now.
[59:29.100 --> 59:29.820]  You fucking got me.
[59:29.880 --> 59:30.480]  God damn it.
[59:31.800 --> 59:32.520]  Oh, God.
[59:34.140 --> 59:35.140]  Oh, fucking hell.
[59:35.800 --> 59:40.280]  You guys like you guys like, you know, when you know the little apple pies, the little
[59:40.280 --> 59:42.160]  hot apple pies you get at fast food restaurants.
[59:42.860 --> 59:46.940]  No, like at McDonald's or Top Notch has them.
[59:47.000 --> 59:47.740]  They're fucking great.
[59:48.200 --> 59:49.340]  They're like, what do you call those?
[59:49.400 --> 59:50.640]  Like, are they called hand pies?
[59:50.720 --> 59:51.300]  Is that what they are?
[59:51.380 --> 59:51.840]  I think so.
[59:52.520 --> 59:55.840]  Like when I was a kid, they were Dolly Madison made them and they were the ones that had
[59:55.840 --> 59:57.840]  the Peanuts characters on them.
[59:58.340 --> 59:58.680]  You know what I mean?
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.460]  Like you get a little cherry pie and like Charlie Brown on it or Lucy or whatever.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.540]  I mean, I know what you're talking about, but then you started talking about Snoopy
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.660]  on it or whatever, and I don't know what you're talking about anymore.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:07.720]  Oh, you don't know those?
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:08.940]  It might be before your time.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.520]  Hold on.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.860]  Snoopy hand pies?
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:12.480]  What?
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.620]  Oh, there you go.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.500]  This is my whole childhood.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.980]  I know the pies.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.100]  I know what you're talking about.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.020]  I've just never seen them with Snoopy guys or whatever.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.340]  Also, Snoopy is not on these enough.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.220]  This is ridiculous.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.520]  That's like...
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.600]  They were really highlighting the human kids back in the day.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.140]  But yeah, the cherry one with Charlie Brown was...
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.360]  They were all good, I'll be honest.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:37.860]  Pineapple?
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.160]  The cherry...
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.120]  Yeah, that was good, too.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.320]  Interesting.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.600]  I don't understand why peppermint patty would be on a strawberry.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.660]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.100]  Well, they're not anymore, right?
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.980]  So clearly it didn't...
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.260]  They decided to sunset it.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.560]  But anyway, I've been thinking about those specifically a lot lately.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.200]  I don't know why.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.220]  Just because I loved them when I was a kid and they popped into my head.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.000]  And so anytime I go to a fast food restaurant, I've been endeavoring to get the little apple pie
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.500]  or whatever pie they have.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.480]  And I got to be honest with you guys.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.440]  I think the world is sleeping on these fucking little fruit pies.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.480]  I think that they are rife for a comeback.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.600]  And we should be on the ground floor.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:21.980]  We should start getting into hand pies in a big way.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.940]  Because they are fucking delicious and they're easy.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.180]  Oh, the hostess TMNT!
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.240]  Yeah, that's what I remember.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.300]  Yes! That's another great one.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.560]  I do agree that people are sleeping on them.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.160]  I think that the problem is they haven't changed in such a long time.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.880]  You know what you're getting and you know what you're getting is kind of like whack.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.660]  It's great when you're a kid and then you have one as an adult and you go,
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.880]  where did all the filling go?
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.260]  What is this?
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.480]  Because I got one not too long ago and I enjoyed it.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.880]  But not as much as when I was a child.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.740]  Is it because the child versions would be illegal now just because of too much sugar or something?
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.420]  I bet they're pretty close to the same.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.960]  I bet the sugar is like a little different.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.000]  But also when you're a kid, your brain isn't formed.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.360]  So, you know, this tastes like magic because you've had seven flavors in your life.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.580]  So I think that has a lot to do with it.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:23.540]  Most things when you're a kid, you're having it for the first time or maybe the second time.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.360]  So everything is new and exciting.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.680]  Like I said, I've been eating them a lot lately, right?
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.640]  So I had one at McDonald's the other day that wasn't great.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.860]  But I had one at that same McDonald's like a week later that
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.280]  knocked my dick off of my body.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:36.920]  It was so good.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.700]  So I think it's a bit of hit or miss.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.020]  But there are still some...
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.080]  I'm just saying, I just want to put this out there because I want everybody to have it
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:45.880]  in the back of your head.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.600]  Don't sleep on these things.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.060]  Maybe give one a try sometime soon.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.820]  I really do think that as a society, we're missing the boat right now.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.640]  Well, how do you how do you feel about savory ones?
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.320]  I need an example.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.300]  I like meat and peas and all that.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.160]  Is there a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on it still?
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.040]  Sure.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.440]  I'm into it.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.220]  I'd be willing to give it a try.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.100]  I'd be willing to give it a try.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.760]  But it's definitely like a dessert in my head.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.460]  But I'm like, I'm, you know, I'm OK with giving a meat pie a try.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.700]  You got two hands.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:15.480]  It's true.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:17.000]  Very good point.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.740]  That is a great point.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.240]  You could stuff a salad in one and have an appetizer one too.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.360]  Salad pie.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:25.860]  It's the worst.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.620]  I'm a I'm becoming a new kind of guy, by the way.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.320]  I'm going to become a lawn guy.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.840]  You're going to become a lawn guy?
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.660]  Howard, what are you doing with your lawn?
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.100]  I'm excited.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.400]  I'm going to mow it.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.580]  OK, I'm less excited.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:45.500]  What do you mean?
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.060]  I don't.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.260]  Why would that be an exciting thing?
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.740]  I've been mowing my lawn for 49 years.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.660]  Yeah, it's like, yeah.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.700]  Hey, dude, it sucks.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.100]  It fucking sucks to mow your lawn.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:56.840]  Really?
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.760]  I just suddenly I suddenly was looking at my lawn.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.160]  I thought I want to mow that.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.420]  I want to buy a lawn mower and mow it.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.000]  Do you want to come over and mow my lawn?
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.060]  You can mow my lawn.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:04.900]  God, no.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:05.700]  I want to mow my lawn.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:10.260]  I immediately fired the guy who's been mowing it for the last nine years.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840]  And I ordered a mower.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:12.960]  Just on a whim.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.180]  Wait, what?
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:14.400]  What?
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.660]  I could have given you a lawnmower.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.180]  I just sold my house.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:19.960]  I don't need mine.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.220]  Oh, I gave it to the movers.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.300]  Have you done it yet?
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.280]  No, it's fine.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.620]  Are you sure that you're a lawn guy?
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.260]  Well, I don't.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.330]  I'm going to become one.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.620]  Wait, have I jumped into this too soon?
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.200]  No, you're fine here.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:36.520]  Yeah.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.800]  Think about this, Eric.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.740]  He finds manual labor not like charming.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.520]  And he loves the sun.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.800]  And he loves to be out in the sun.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.460]  So that's like the perfect activity.
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:51.960]  I love like power washing and like painting walls.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.420]  I love like finishing the square.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.660]  I understand.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:56.980]  I mean, I get that.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.800]  I don't mind mowing.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.800]  The act of mowing my lawn is fine.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.660]  It's not the act that is the bothersome thing.
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.880]  It is the, all right, well, it's Friday and I have some time.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.720]  Is this what I'm doing with my time?
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.100]  I'll put it off for a day.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:12.680]  Uh-oh.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.540]  It's Saturday.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.980]  I got to do this thing.
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:15.660]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.840]  I put it off for another day.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.400]  Uh-oh.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.140]  It's Sunday.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.060]  It's only getting longer.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.880]  And this is forever.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.980]  I don't think I would procrastinate that.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.160]  I think I would use that as my procrastination.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:27.840]  Really?
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:28.700]  Yeah.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.780]  You'll learn not to procrastinate pretty fast because once it gets out of control,
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.980]  it's like three times the work.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.400]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.280]  Yeah.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.760]  We are on completely different ends of this spectrum, which I love.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.620]  I'm loading up procrastination.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.840]  I'm throwing it on.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.160]  I'm putting the weights on the procrastination scale.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.980]  I'm excited when I have laundry to fold or something because it's like,
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:54.580]  oh, I'm going to sit down and fold laundry and watch an episode of something instead of edit.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.540]  What are you guys watching right now?
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.140]  Every Denzel movie available.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.180]  Oh, right, right.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.660]  So Roman J. Israel.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.860]  He Got Game, I watched.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.660]  That's a good movie.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.500]  The Mighty Quinn.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.540]  He Got Game is Ray Allen, right?
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.240]  Isn't he the one that plays Jesus Shuttlesworth?
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:12.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.520]  Uh, what's another one I watch?
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.880]  Antoine Fisher.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.300]  That movie's a real bummer when you realize it's a true story.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.460]  That was unfortunate.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.280]  I didn't realize it was a real thing until it ended.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.760]  Survivor just ended.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.200]  It was one of the best seasons in a long time, I thought.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:29.880]  That was really good.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.660]  I haven't watched any of it.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.280]  I need to watch it.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.740]  I watched... have you guys seen that show Expedition from Hell on HBO?
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.040]  No.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:36.260]  No.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:42.280]  It's a documentary about this Israeli special forces dude who in his 60s,
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:46.260]  to fight to raise money for cancer awareness for kids that have cancer,
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.300]  because he's a cancer survivor,
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.620]  he decides he's going to cross the entirety of the Amazon from one coast to the other,
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.760]  5,000 straight miles.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.800]  Nobody's ever done it in the history of humanity.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:01.900]  And it's just a documentary about him being a lunatic and probably a charlatan
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.620]  and stealing money and all kinds of nonsense that goes along with it.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.780]  It's pretty insane.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:07.860]  I liked it.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:08.980]  That's awesome.
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:13.880]  Can I propose that I want to watch something with some of you guys?
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.720]  Because I don't know that...
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.440]  I want to watch it by myself, but I mean, Gavin's going to have no interest,
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:22.040]  but Jeff, I think maybe you do.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.340]  Is it Eraserhead?
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:23.940]  I'll watch it with you.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.420]  I watched it with Gavin.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.320]  Oh, the Clippers?
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:25.880]  Yeah.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.960]  Are you watching Clipped?
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.960]  I haven't watched it yet, but I'm going to.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:30.380]  Is it good?
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:30.820]  Me neither.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.120]  I want to watch it also, just because I keep seeing the comparisons of the players
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.400]  to the people who play them.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:44.000]  It has been like, it makes me want to watch it so bad.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.180]  I want to...
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.680]  I really want to watch it because it looks goofy as shit.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.760]  I think this is supposed to be J.J. Reddick.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:53.980]  Yep.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.220]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.880]  And Chris Paul.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.540]  Oh, well, let's have a watch party when I get back, when I get home from Boston.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.520]  I really do.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.600]  Like, if you want to watch that, I will sit down.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.940]  We can stream it together and watch it.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.840]  I would love to do that.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.380]  Laura's husband looks so much like Doc Rivers there.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.780]  You're going to Boston to watch the game?
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.080]  I'm going to Boston to the game.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.480]  They're playing Dallas.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.460]  What are you doing?
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:21.840]  I'm going to see him.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.120]  Oh, yeah, I'm going to see him.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.720]  Did not cross my mind.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.060]  That's insane.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.400]  Oh, that's exhausting.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.920]  Allow me to retort.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.720]  First off, it's a birthday present to me from my wife.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:41.760]  Secondly, I have the opportunity to see Boston play in the finals at the Garden.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.320]  And you think I'm going to pass that up?
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.140]  Like, there's no way in hell I'm going to pass it up.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.700]  I'm make no mistake about it.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.920]  I'm going to Dallas to see a second finals game.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.220]  I will go to two finals game.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.900]  And if it goes to seven, I'll go to three and sell some blood or something.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.140]  But I didn't have any say so over the first game.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.960]  That was my wife booking a trip for me for my birthday.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.480]  It just never occurred to me that you were leaving the state of Texas.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.820]  Oh, yeah, I'm doing more than that, dude.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.680]  We're doing way more than that.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:14.340]  We're going to Chicago and then Boston because my wife, my wife's sister is going to Chicago
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:19.040]  to surprise her best friend and her husband who are going to Chicago for the weekend.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.360]  And they're going to do like an architectural tour on a boat.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.840]  So my wife's sister decided that she's just going to get tickets and show up on the boat
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.720]  and just run into them and be like, oh, what a surprise.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.300]  We're both here.
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:33.500]  And then so Emily thought it would be funny if we also show up on the boat and surprise all of them.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:40.300]  So I'm getting up at four in the morning tomorrow to fly to Chicago so I can get on like a 9 a.m.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.160]  boat so I could surprise people.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.000]  That's so awesome.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.460]  Then I can turn around and go to Boston the next day to go see the Celtics play at home
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.960]  for game two of the finals.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.720]  And then I'll turn around and come right back to close on my house.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.760]  It's like when we all woke up at five to surprise you in Vegas.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:56.780]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.620]  I'm returning the favor.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.440]  You know what I'm not doing?
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.320]  Guess what I'm not doing?
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.040]  What?
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.300]  A walking group and a sketched group.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.080]  I walked in, I booked it and I did it on our company email.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.980]  So you guys know I'm busy at that time.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.240]  Those are nap hours.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.280]  Nap time.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.560]  So that's going to be in our company calendar.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.920]  Yeah, it's on the calendar.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.320]  At least I tried to.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.040]  So am I going to get an alert for this?
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.500]  I think you should.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.400]  Saturday, you're going to see it.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.220]  I got it booked from nine until noon.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.600]  That'll be the time for us all to start calling Andrew's Umidigi and try to wake him up.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.960]  I never thought I would have to interact with that Umidigi so much.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.820]  Oh, all the time.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.820]  I have to interact with it later because I have to log into stuff.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.980]  So I got a Umidigi fucking codes after this.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.480]  Let's wrap up so we can do some Umidigi codes.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.780]  Yep, that's the plan.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.100]  So that's forever, huh?
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.680]  This freaking Umidigi situation.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.340]  No, you're going to send me a phone.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.220]  Oh, yeah, remember how that was supposed to happen?
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.280]  One last thing as we wrap up and Gavin gets the phone ready.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.940]  When we were first starting, I asked everybody what year they were born in because I was
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.340]  putting something together for SoAllRight and I had so much fun with it.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.960]  I thought I would try it with y'all and do it with y'all too.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.780]  Do you guys know what the number one song in Billboard was the year you were born?
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.260]  Just off the top of your head.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.440]  Oh, no, no.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.820]  I looked it up for everybody.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:31.540]  Okay.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:38.060]  Mine, 1975, the Billboard number one year end song or the song for the year is
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:45.820]  Unfortunately, Love Will Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille, which is a absolute dog shit song.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.880]  How does that go?
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.480]  Love will keep us together.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.420]  Love will keep us together.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.840]  We love each other.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.600]  It's so fucking stupid.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.380]  It's like introducing opera.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.780]  Did you know in that song they're singing words?
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.120]  Did you know it's songs or words?
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.340]  So my top three are so brutal.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.720]  It's Love Will Keep Us Together, Rhinestone, Cowboy and Philadelphia Freedom, which is like
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.240]  the only bad Elton John song.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:13.800]  Wow.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.740]  That's rough trade, bud.
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.720]  Real rough trade.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.200]  Real bummer.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.540]  But for Eric, you were born in 1986.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.180]  I knew yours because the same year as my wife.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.780]  The number one song of the year.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.340]  It's a good one.
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.540]  That's What Friends Are For by Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.500]  So solid, solid song.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:31.740]  That's cool.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.820]  I don't love that song, but, you know, it's like it's not Captain and Tennille, so that's fine.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:36.320]  Yeah.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:36.760]  It's good.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:37.660]  It's a great song.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.400]  Nick, I think, might have my favorite of all the songs, even though I guess it hasn't aged well.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.160]  Nick, you were born in 1987.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.220]  The number one song in 1987 was Walk Like an Egyptian by The Bangles.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.580]  Oh, awesome.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.280]  Great fucking song.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.720]  A great video.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:56.780]  A great video.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.140]  1988 is the year that Gavin Free was born.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.540]  And I gotta say, this is maybe, yeah, this is maybe the most apropos song,
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.060]  even the top five, top four for Gavin are insane.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.600]  Gavin, do you off the top of your head know what the number one song was the year you were born?
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:14.740]  I don't.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.500]  By a fellow Brit, George Michael.
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.140]  It was Faith.
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.260]  Oh, wow.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.720]  The Little Biscuit song?
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.300]  That's awesome.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.700]  Number two was Need You Tonight by NXS.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.420]  Number three was Got My Mind Set on You by George Harrison.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.240]  Number four was Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.680]  It was a very Brit-heavy year.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.160]  I would say that's four Bangles.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.360]  That's pretty, that was pretty fucking good, man.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.960]  And I would associate you with most of the songs, except for Need You Tonight.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.520]  I'm pretty sure I've listened to all those songs every year since I've been born.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.300]  Yeah.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.100]  I bet you have.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:48.320]  And then pulling up the rear is Andrew, born in 1994.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:55.140]  The number one song in 1994 was Ace of Bass, The Sign.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]  That is your birth song.
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.740]  So I think out of everybody, I think Nick probably won and I feel like I lost.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.120]  I definitely have the shittiest song.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.100]  But it was fun.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.060]  You should go through and look at the list of top 100,
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.560]  because there's all kinds of stuff in there that you'll be like,
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.460]  oh, fuck, that's crazy.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.360]  That was the year I was born.
