[00:00.000 --> 00:03.580]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.940 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[00:06.940 --> 00:10.500]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.940 --> 00:12.360]  Available for a limited time.
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.700]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.120 --> 00:18.500]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:18.740 --> 00:20.000]  This is number 48.
[00:20.140 --> 00:21.360]  My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:21.440 --> 00:24.280]  With me, as always, Andrew, Gavin, Nick, and Eric.
[00:24.720 --> 00:25.600]  They're just first names.
[00:26.140 --> 00:26.380]  Hello.
[00:26.920 --> 00:27.660]  I have a question.
[00:28.080 --> 00:28.720]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:28.720 --> 00:31.100]  I just have a question for someone who speaks coffee.
[00:31.620 --> 00:31.980]  Okay.
[00:32.160 --> 00:34.240]  So I just had a little quick espresso, right?
[00:34.320 --> 00:35.300]  Put it in a mug.
[00:35.760 --> 00:37.600]  And I was gonna make it an Americano.
[00:37.700 --> 00:38.880]  I was gonna put hot water in it.
[00:39.140 --> 00:40.000]  Ran out of water.
[00:40.240 --> 00:44.080]  So I just put a bit of milk on top of the espresso shot and microwaved it.
[00:44.140 --> 00:44.760]  What have I made?
[00:45.320 --> 00:47.760]  Uh, milk and espresso together?
[00:47.980 --> 00:49.340]  Is that like a...
[00:49.340 --> 00:49.860]  Flat white?
[00:50.560 --> 00:51.560]  Cortado or latte?
[00:51.560 --> 00:51.960]  No, no, no.
[00:52.140 --> 00:54.140]  It's like a latte technically, isn't it?
[00:54.160 --> 00:55.180]  Because you've just used...
[00:55.180 --> 00:55.880]  Well, was the milk...
[00:55.880 --> 00:56.780]  I guess you microwaved it.
[00:56.780 --> 00:59.120]  The milk was just like a splash of milk there.
[00:59.320 --> 01:00.340]  And it wasn't foam, right?
[01:01.260 --> 01:06.820]  Yeah, then it would be a latte because isn't a macchiato like milk foam or something?
[01:06.900 --> 01:08.880]  It's Henry Hill's favorite drink, caramel macchiato.
[01:10.640 --> 01:15.180]  Gavin, did I hear correctly when you said earlier you ran out of water?
[01:16.060 --> 01:16.240]  Yeah.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.040]  What the fuck?
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.480]  Dude, I didn't even clock that.
[01:19.620 --> 01:21.000]  Jeff, congratulations.
[01:21.360 --> 01:21.920]  That was great.
[01:21.980 --> 01:22.760]  That's a good catch.
[01:23.120 --> 01:25.100]  Now, let's get him.
[01:25.440 --> 01:26.620]  You don't like...
[01:26.620 --> 01:27.240]  You don't make water?
[01:27.600 --> 01:28.280]  Like filtered water?
[01:28.980 --> 01:30.520]  Oh, you know, I see what he's saying.
[01:30.640 --> 01:31.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31.240 --> 01:32.840]  So you didn't have any more filter water.
[01:32.960 --> 01:33.420]  And it was...
[01:33.420 --> 01:33.640]  Okay.
[01:34.240 --> 01:36.220]  Yeah, I've got like a tank on the kitchen counter.
[01:36.240 --> 01:37.460]  Mine is in my fridge.
[01:37.720 --> 01:38.620]  It's like in a...
[01:38.620 --> 01:39.540]  You just like get it out of the fridge.
[01:39.680 --> 01:41.200]  So I understand now.
[01:41.400 --> 01:45.040]  See, I've got a fridge that came with the house.
[01:45.160 --> 01:49.460]  It's one of those like upmarket refrigerators, which means that it doesn't have any features.
[01:50.400 --> 01:51.340]  It's a piece of shit.
[01:51.840 --> 01:53.120]  It barely makes ice.
[01:53.200 --> 01:54.420]  It doesn't dispense any water.
[01:54.420 --> 01:59.560]  Yet somehow, probably twice the price of a nice Samsung that could do that and have a screen on it.
[01:59.940 --> 02:00.720]  Here's what I think we should do.
[02:00.840 --> 02:01.580]  Around about...
[02:01.580 --> 02:04.360]  Oh, after you someday decide to sell your house and move on.
[02:04.620 --> 02:04.760]  Yeah.
[02:04.800 --> 02:06.240]  And you're emptying it out.
[02:06.520 --> 02:08.140]  I'm going to go take a look at your fridge.
[02:08.220 --> 02:11.320]  And I'm going to show you where all that shit is that you didn't notice for 20 years.
[02:11.380 --> 02:13.240]  Oh, you think he just doesn't know it's there?
[02:13.640 --> 02:14.000]  He might.
[02:14.080 --> 02:14.540]  Can you do that this week?
[02:14.660 --> 02:16.180]  Because I swear, I've like looked.
[02:16.680 --> 02:17.920]  I've looked in like the hinges.
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.220]  It's a very full of like panels.
[02:19.520 --> 02:22.660]  It only works if you've already sold the fridge, unfortunately.
[02:22.660 --> 02:24.660]  If I tried to show it to you now, I wouldn't be able to find it.
[02:25.560 --> 02:27.620]  Because I have to put water filters in it.
[02:28.800 --> 02:28.840]  Interesting.
[02:29.400 --> 02:31.560]  But I can't find where the water comes out.
[02:31.720 --> 02:32.720]  Yeah, for the ice.
[02:34.140 --> 02:38.760]  So my ice is supposedly nice and filtered, but why can't it just give me water?
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.120]  It has to give you water if it's doing filtering.
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.400]  You constantly have a glass full of ice just melting on the counter.
[02:46.740 --> 02:48.520]  Six hours, oh boy.
[02:48.520 --> 02:52.780]  I'm waiting for waiting so I could shove it into my espresso machine.
[02:53.240 --> 02:54.880]  What temperature water do you want?
[02:55.060 --> 02:56.320]  OK, you can have that at 215.
[02:59.960 --> 03:04.040]  I might bring it to a different place, Jeff, when Gavin said water.
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.120]  I realized that's one of the most British sounding words he has.
[03:08.520 --> 03:12.960]  So I just wrote down British words, water, and I'm going to be on the lookout for more
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.860]  British sounding words.
[03:14.120 --> 03:18.500]  See if we can get the most British sounding sentence from Gavin at some point in the future.
[03:19.100 --> 03:20.360]  Water really is.
[03:20.520 --> 03:22.400]  That's a strong one for you.
[03:22.620 --> 03:26.360]  What is the most American sounding word, Gavin?
[03:28.220 --> 03:28.780]  Freedom.
[03:34.810 --> 03:39.610]  I was trying to like quickly somehow post the eagle sound, but I couldn't.
[03:39.730 --> 03:40.190]  I couldn't get it.
[03:40.650 --> 03:42.870]  It's not in the Discord save sound effects.
[03:43.510 --> 03:50.990]  I was talking to some family member or someone married to a family member of yours at your
[03:50.990 --> 03:51.270]  wedding.
[03:51.790 --> 03:55.410]  We were talking about football, a British dude who was really excited to talk to somebody
[03:55.410 --> 03:56.010]  about American football.
[03:56.450 --> 04:00.970]  And his wife, who may or may not be related to you, I can't remember, came over and listened
[04:00.970 --> 04:05.590]  to us talk for about 45 seconds and then said, I haven't understood a single word either
[04:05.590 --> 04:06.330]  of you have said.
[04:06.810 --> 04:11.070]  It's just the most American sounding thing to me, but none of it makes sense and none
[04:11.070 --> 04:12.050]  of its actual words.
[04:12.070 --> 04:14.830]  It's just American sounds, which I thought was weird.
[04:14.990 --> 04:16.430]  As a kid, I used to...
[04:16.430 --> 04:21.630]  I had a friend who we used to make pretend radio and one of our features was American
[04:21.630 --> 04:22.370]  word of the week.
[04:22.770 --> 04:26.110]  And I don't remember any of them, but one of them was, one of them was kerosene.
[04:27.250 --> 04:27.690]  Kerosene.
[04:28.150 --> 04:28.330]  Yeah.
[04:28.390 --> 04:29.810]  That's an American sounding word.
[04:29.930 --> 04:31.030]  It sounds well American.
[04:31.730 --> 04:33.470]  Yeah, you sound American saying it.
[04:34.370 --> 04:36.010]  It's definitely not a WADA situation.
[04:36.010 --> 04:37.050]  I don't think you couldn't.
[04:37.350 --> 04:37.790]  Kerosene.
[04:38.690 --> 04:42.670]  So how many episodes did you and your friend?
[04:43.310 --> 04:44.850]  Oh, of Hit Shit FM.
[04:45.110 --> 04:47.470]  It was, I think, seven or eight episodes.
[04:48.850 --> 04:50.850]  Do you, you don't have those saved anywhere, do you?
[04:51.470 --> 04:53.890]  Oh, they might be on a tape, like a cassette.
[04:54.150 --> 04:55.310]  Oh, you recorded them?
[04:55.730 --> 04:56.390]  Yeah, it was.
[04:56.650 --> 04:57.030]  Wow.
[04:57.230 --> 04:59.530]  We couldn't actually get on the radio, so we had to record it.
[04:59.790 --> 05:03.730]  Gavin, what do we have to do to get and listen to and play that?
[05:03.930 --> 05:05.410]  An episode of Hit Shit FM?
[05:05.890 --> 05:06.270]  Yeah.
[05:06.550 --> 05:07.410]  Yeah, for regulation.
[05:08.030 --> 05:08.430]  God.
[05:09.350 --> 05:10.010]  Oh, God.
[05:10.010 --> 05:12.930]  I think finding it will be a real, real issue.
[05:13.590 --> 05:15.950]  Is that why you're so obsessed with storing stuff now?
[05:16.050 --> 05:20.590]  Because you lost Hit Shit FM and it's haunted you your whole life?
[05:21.110 --> 05:24.310]  I like you keep bringing up this obsession that I store my files.
[05:24.430 --> 05:25.630]  That's not a weird thing.
[05:26.670 --> 05:30.170]  You have drive after drive after drive of file.
[05:30.270 --> 05:31.170]  You don't need all those files.
[05:32.050 --> 05:32.910]  You don't need all of them.
[05:34.150 --> 05:36.690]  You're asking, like, if I'd saved Hit Shit FM,
[05:36.690 --> 05:40.490]  if I digitized it in 1997 or whatever it was.
[05:40.950 --> 05:41.090]  Yeah.
[05:41.990 --> 05:43.310]  We would have it right now, wouldn't we?
[05:44.070 --> 05:48.710]  Exactly. Which is why now you do that. That was my point. Because you didn't then.
[05:49.070 --> 05:52.850]  I'm not going to take file advice from the guy who records something, uploads it, and deletes it.
[05:53.350 --> 05:55.570]  Records something, uploads it, and deletes it?
[05:56.570 --> 05:59.650]  Oh, the company went away. Okay, so where are your copies? Oh.
[06:03.120 --> 06:04.340]  Yeah, but the company went away.
[06:06.380 --> 06:10.140]  The company could have chucked you a couple of like eight terabyte drives and all of the
[06:10.140 --> 06:12.400]  stuff you've ever recorded for this podcast, you'd still have.
[06:12.720 --> 06:15.220]  Don't need it, though. I don't think it means that.
[06:15.400 --> 06:18.240]  We did need it. We did need it.
[06:18.560 --> 06:20.640]  We did end up needing it. That's true.
[06:22.600 --> 06:27.460]  But your ratio to what you have to what you've used, I'd argue, is way off.
[06:27.860 --> 06:30.780]  I've not finished living yet. Who knows what I'll need later?
[06:31.660 --> 06:34.900]  That's my point is I'm telling you, you're going to get to the end.
[06:35.180 --> 06:41.780]  You know what your files are? It's like it's like a big box of cables.
[06:42.420 --> 06:45.880]  You know, box cables that you've just like accumulated.
[06:46.060 --> 06:48.940]  It's a box of labeled and searchable cables.
[06:49.260 --> 06:51.000]  Oh, you have your cables are really organized.
[06:53.260 --> 06:55.940]  That does sound like you, actually, if you're saving all your storage.
[06:56.040 --> 06:57.680]  Are you asking me if I've named my files?
[06:57.680 --> 07:02.300]  I think he's saying that his files in the analogy that you're using are the cables.
[07:02.520 --> 07:05.320]  And he's very organized in the way he names his files.
[07:05.480 --> 07:07.400]  Not actual physical cables, Andrew.
[07:07.880 --> 07:11.900]  I'm talking physical cables. I'm saying that I'm going insane.
[07:12.240 --> 07:14.960]  Physical cables. I've got a drawer, a little set of drawers,
[07:15.140 --> 07:16.420]  and they've got different cables in them.
[07:16.640 --> 07:22.140]  Yeah, but my point is, is that you accumulate all these cables and then you never use like 80%.
[07:22.140 --> 07:25.140]  You are having a laugh. You would not believe the amount of times where I've been like,
[07:25.140 --> 07:28.400]  oh, I wish I had this. Oh, oh, you want to hear something?
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.100]  Oh, hang on. Oh, hang on, here's one.
[07:31.160 --> 07:32.240]  Gavin? Yeah?
[07:32.360 --> 07:34.740]  I threw away all my cables a few weeks ago.
[07:35.360 --> 07:36.180]  Got rid of them. What do you mean?
[07:36.520 --> 07:38.940]  All of them. I had...
[07:38.940 --> 07:41.240]  You threw them away. That's such a waste. Surely you'll need one.
[07:41.960 --> 07:46.080]  But I don't because they're in a box and I've never went into the box for the cable.
[07:46.700 --> 07:47.700]  Oh, I always do.
[07:47.940 --> 07:52.200]  I'm constantly going... my cable box is my most frequented box, probably.
[07:52.200 --> 07:58.160]  Haven't opened it since I put cables in the last time I put... I stored cables.
[07:58.460 --> 08:02.360]  Don't use it. Got rid of 90% of my cables.
[08:03.220 --> 08:03.980]  They're gone.
[08:04.020 --> 08:06.140]  Did you like sell them or donate them or just chuck them?
[08:06.380 --> 08:08.460]  I donated them. I don't know. I don't know.
[08:09.040 --> 08:10.520]  I'm someone who'll buy cables.
[08:10.980 --> 08:14.280]  The needy need all these cables. This is a Dreamcast plug.
[08:16.080 --> 08:21.360]  I donated a bunch of old like tech stuff I had and cables was one of it.
[08:21.360 --> 08:27.340]  And my logic was, I know for a fact that I'm getting rid of cables that are related to
[08:27.340 --> 08:34.080]  things I currently own. But if I need it badly, I'll discover it then and I'll deal with that
[08:34.080 --> 08:37.960]  then. And so far, I've never had that issue. I haven't encountered it yet.
[08:38.020 --> 08:39.860]  And I don't think I will for a long time.
[08:40.060 --> 08:42.880]  I think I have that issue maybe once a month.
[08:43.280 --> 08:43.540]  Once a month.
[08:43.540 --> 08:46.660]  I go for a right rummage and I'm like, oh, here's one. Sweet.
[08:47.110 --> 08:52.540]  I guess maybe our tech. I don't know. It's different. What we're going for.
[08:52.900 --> 08:53.000]  Yeah.
[08:53.240 --> 08:55.880]  I guess with what you do as well for work with the slow-mo stuff,
[08:56.040 --> 08:59.640]  you're probably utilizing a lot more different devices than I am.
[09:00.960 --> 09:03.480]  We're so deep in this conversation.
[09:03.740 --> 09:09.220]  And Andrew is just for the first time realizing that their needs are not one to one.
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.140]  I'm just articulating why. Yeah.
[09:14.340 --> 09:17.940]  I'm not articulating. You don't need any specific line of work to
[09:18.400 --> 09:20.920]  have the company you work for just give you a backup drive.
[09:21.480 --> 09:24.820]  That's that's fair. I just don't think I'll use...
[09:26.100 --> 09:28.900]  Well, I mean, I do it for you. I do it for you.
[09:30.040 --> 09:33.580]  I'll drag my files every once in a while, throw them in a drive and then go,
[09:33.740 --> 09:34.800]  we're never going to use this.
[09:35.180 --> 09:36.980]  Every once in a while.
[09:38.180 --> 09:42.920]  I've never understood. That's it's like buying a fire extinguisher,
[09:43.020 --> 09:45.680]  being like, no, I don't see I don't see myself using. I've not used it yet.
[09:45.800 --> 09:46.780]  I'm not going to use this.
[09:47.420 --> 09:50.900]  But the difference between you and I is that you own 17 fire extinguishers.
[09:51.360 --> 09:52.160]  That's my point.
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.440]  Good to have different fire extinguishers for different types of fire, in my opinion.
[09:56.980 --> 09:58.240]  You know, while we're arguing,
[09:58.460 --> 10:01.660]  while we're arguing, I want to steer the argument away from you.
[10:01.880 --> 10:03.340]  We're arguing? I didn't know we were arguing.
[10:03.480 --> 10:04.320]  Definitely arguing.
[10:04.760 --> 10:08.460]  After the last episode that came out, which was the one before this one, right?
[10:09.020 --> 10:09.720]  That's how that works.
[10:10.360 --> 10:12.860]  Well, it was the one before the last one. We're talking about worms.
[10:13.080 --> 10:14.060]  And I heard about worms. Yeah.
[10:14.300 --> 10:17.940]  A lot of the audience, I was surprised, sided with me.
[10:18.300 --> 10:19.160]  They sure did. Yeah.
[10:19.440 --> 10:21.600]  There are some people, there are some people who didn't.
[10:21.660 --> 10:23.780]  I've got an example right here. We can, we can blur out the name,
[10:23.960 --> 10:26.120]  but I just want to address this comment.
[10:26.260 --> 10:29.640]  It says, this is on YouTube. It says, I'm on Andrew's side.
[10:30.340 --> 10:33.060]  Most games don't have an arbitrary number of players, like six.
[10:33.060 --> 10:37.880]  So it's natural to assume four is the max. I didn't know four wasn't the max either.
[10:38.260 --> 10:41.980]  Having the knowledge, Gavin should have thought to point it out sooner.
[10:42.320 --> 10:44.100]  Like, why aren't we all playing?
[10:44.480 --> 10:48.560]  I did! That's exactly what happened. I was in the first one.
[10:48.780 --> 10:51.600]  We didn't need six people. We just needed four.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.380]  That wasn't it anymore, Worms. The next one I was in, I said, hey, why aren't we all playing?
[10:57.980 --> 11:01.340]  Hey, Gav? Gav, can I use you for a second?
[11:01.340 --> 11:05.200]  Before we go any further, can I just say, I really think you gotta move on, man.
[11:05.300 --> 11:07.560]  You gotta like, this is so far in the past.
[11:07.840 --> 11:08.500]  That's, that's fair.
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.460]  Before we move on, because you're right, I saw a lot of people...
[11:11.460 --> 11:13.120]  You bring it up every episode.
[11:13.420 --> 11:17.040]  You know, he's right. A lot of people were on his side, and there are a lot of people's,
[11:17.080 --> 11:18.400]  you know, I made...
[11:18.400 --> 11:19.560]  Take your victory lap.
[11:19.960 --> 11:23.740]  Yeah, well, but we're not done with the victory lap yet. We haven't established that.
[11:23.960 --> 11:26.760]  He, what, are you going to be a sore winner? I don't get it.
[11:26.920 --> 11:29.960]  No, I'm just, I'm saying what I'm, I'm trying to get to the point of,
[11:29.960 --> 11:33.620]  there were a lot of people that said that it is my responsibility,
[11:34.040 --> 11:36.800]  even though Gavin brought this up and keeps bringing it up,
[11:36.820 --> 11:39.320]  that it was my responsibility to prove him wrong.
[11:41.160 --> 11:43.600]  And I, so what, what's the issue?
[11:43.680 --> 11:47.600]  So I just want to, I want to see if I can, is the whole thing that you weren't,
[11:47.660 --> 11:51.760]  there wasn't a Worms experience prior to that in which we were all there and one of us sat out?
[11:51.980 --> 11:52.880]  Is that what you're saying?
[11:53.820 --> 11:55.200]  Uh, was there? I don't think so.
[11:56.200 --> 11:58.280]  Am I looking for that? Is that the whole point?
[11:58.280 --> 12:00.040]  Is that the conflict that you're yelling about?
[12:00.300 --> 12:01.800]  Okay, I have a clip. I have a clip.
[12:02.300 --> 12:03.400]  Oh, fuck.
[12:04.420 --> 12:05.140]  Okay, go for it.
[12:05.260 --> 12:06.720]  You should, you just shouldn't have brought it up, maybe.
[12:06.820 --> 12:07.800]  Wait, hang on, hang on.
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.060]  I might be, I might be jumping the gun here.
[12:10.140 --> 12:11.880]  I might be on the wrong side of history here.
[12:11.900 --> 12:15.680]  I have to say, I tried to engineer an out for Gavin three minutes ago.
[12:16.120 --> 12:17.900]  I'm going to put a link to a video in the chat.
[12:19.100 --> 12:19.460]  5950.
[12:20.300 --> 12:21.720]  Our first video.
[12:22.260 --> 12:22.840]  Oh, yes.
[12:23.100 --> 12:27.680]  A stream in which the five of us were playing a variety of games.
[12:28.280 --> 12:29.320]  Party Animals was one.
[12:29.700 --> 12:32.200]  Because I thought, oh, maybe it was Party Animals I was thinking of.
[12:32.280 --> 12:35.440]  Because you were very opposed to AI being involved in Party Animals.
[12:35.600 --> 12:36.840]  So one of us would sit out.
[12:37.020 --> 12:37.460]  I stand by that.
[12:38.180 --> 12:39.220]  I am sharing my screen.
[12:39.380 --> 12:39.540]  Ready?
[12:39.980 --> 12:41.620]  You said, you said 5950?
[12:42.040 --> 12:42.280]  Yep.
[12:42.780 --> 12:44.360]  Okay, here it is from 5945.
[12:44.760 --> 12:45.020]  Here you go.
[12:45.360 --> 12:46.860]  5950, isn't that a psychic?
[12:46.900 --> 12:47.120]  Shut up.
[12:47.140 --> 12:48.500]  Life is unstoppable in this level.
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.460]  I thrive in the cold.
[12:50.460 --> 12:51.180]  Okay, so it ends.
[12:51.680 --> 12:52.680]  We finished Party Animals.
[12:52.760 --> 12:53.240]  We're all here.
[12:53.360 --> 12:54.260]  Except someone's sitting out.
[12:55.580 --> 12:56.440]  I'll swap out, I say.
[12:56.460 --> 12:56.960]  I think we should play a different game.
[12:57.520 --> 12:58.840]  Eric thinks we should play a different game.
[13:01.340 --> 13:03.100]  All of us together.
[13:03.500 --> 13:04.980]  Our first big day we're streaming.
[13:05.820 --> 13:07.240]  So let's go to Worms.
[13:07.380 --> 13:08.120]  All of us.
[13:13.120 --> 13:14.180]  Four of us.
[13:16.240 --> 13:17.280]  We're all here.
[13:20.020 --> 13:20.460]  We are.
[13:21.720 --> 13:22.720]  All five of us.
[13:22.920 --> 13:26.500]  I'm not in this video, but I'm like, I'm like watching it.
[13:26.500 --> 13:31.260]  He's watching it because we didn't know that we could have more than four.
[13:31.360 --> 13:31.660]  Yep.
[13:31.760 --> 13:32.180]  Yep.
[13:32.260 --> 13:33.500]  You got this, bud.
[13:33.600 --> 13:33.760]  Yep.
[13:33.780 --> 13:34.620]  You're the Worms guy.
[13:34.740 --> 13:36.220]  This is very interesting.
[13:36.540 --> 13:36.780]  Yep.
[13:39.220 --> 13:42.360]  Do you want to wind that back a little bit?
[13:49.520 --> 13:53.440]  I'm real flummoxed about this one.
[13:53.580 --> 13:56.480]  I stand by the fact that we should have known
[13:56.500 --> 14:01.740]  but there was absolutely opportunity for you to establish this prior to,
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.020]  and it is odd that you didn't in that moment be like, what, what, what is happening?
[14:06.440 --> 14:07.540]  Why is one of us sitting out?
[14:08.520 --> 14:09.740]  Why aren't we all playing?
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.580]  So if, if you wrote the, if you wrote that comment that I just got up about,
[14:15.040 --> 14:15.960]  you're right, I apologize.
[14:19.360 --> 14:23.740]  Do you think it's because, although you can have five and party animals, can't you?
[14:24.640 --> 14:27.400]  You can have five, but we sat somebody out because you didn't want AI.
[14:28.020 --> 14:29.460]  So then we moved to Worms.
[14:29.540 --> 14:30.720]  But why would I, why would AI?
[14:31.120 --> 14:33.520]  Because it's, it's, I don't think you can have five and then you can have six.
[14:33.600 --> 14:34.660]  So we'd have to have like one AI.
[14:34.660 --> 14:36.420]  So everyone would have to have AI.
[14:36.540 --> 14:37.540]  So we'd have to accept one team.
[14:37.620 --> 14:39.340]  It would be two human players on a team.
[14:39.400 --> 14:40.600]  And then we've done just five in that.
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.280]  We did much later when we, when we asked Andrew,
[14:45.380 --> 14:46.800]  aren't there other ways to play?
[14:46.800 --> 14:48.260]  And he was like, what do you mean?
[14:48.380 --> 14:52.720]  And then we had to, we had to like dig down and figure out the other game modes,
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.000]  much like you had to dig down and find out that Worms was a six player game.
[14:56.000 --> 14:56.320]  Exactly.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.100]  Look, that was a case of me not knowing.
[15:00.400 --> 15:02.960]  This is a case of you knowing and not vocalizing it for some reason.
[15:08.220 --> 15:13.520]  Every, every year I would say my intelligence gets literally decimated.
[15:13.740 --> 15:15.940]  I don't know what, I don't know what to do about it.
[15:16.780 --> 15:19.700]  Uh, I, I then like realize afterwards, I'm like,
[15:19.740 --> 15:22.280]  oh, what a stupid bastard for sitting through all that for no reason.
[15:22.840 --> 15:23.640]  Happens constantly.
[15:24.260 --> 15:28.180]  Can, can I, since we're talking about depletion of intelligence,
[15:28.540 --> 15:31.360]  I, of course, I just want to, I want to ask a question.
[15:31.360 --> 15:32.780]  I just kind of want to, I'm just wondering,
[15:33.880 --> 15:36.960]  Jeff, are you okay with names or what's been going on with you, dude?
[15:39.200 --> 15:39.600]  Names?
[15:40.820 --> 15:45.900]  I've been trying to hold it together, but, uh, my entire childhood,
[15:47.380 --> 15:50.180]  my grandmother called everybody by the wrong name.
[15:50.180 --> 15:52.940]  Like anytime my grandmother talked to me, she would go,
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.380]  Jacob, Mike, Adam, Jeff, you know, Jeffrey, come here.
[15:56.740 --> 15:56.920]  Yeah.
[15:57.120 --> 16:06.580]  And I, I think it's just in me, you know, when I, and I hear myself do it, I hear her.
[16:06.920 --> 16:10.800]  And I think that maybe she's moved on now.
[16:10.940 --> 16:15.980]  And I think maybe I've taken the mantle of the porky pig of family name.
[16:16.100 --> 16:18.920]  And so I think it's just who I am, you know,
[16:18.920 --> 16:20.660]  and I think it's still probably only going to get worse.
[16:21.900 --> 16:23.400]  I don't, I haven't noticed it.
[16:23.460 --> 16:25.620]  Is this something happening outside of the podcast?
[16:26.080 --> 16:29.720]  Well, did you listen to it in the, what was it a game we were playing the other day or
[16:29.720 --> 16:33.200]  a podcast where you just, you called every, it was the podcast.
[16:33.300 --> 16:35.040]  We're talking about Mario Party and me being late.
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.920]  And then you used everyone's name before you got to yourself.
[16:38.080 --> 16:39.040]  You got to the right one.
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.200]  And then it happened like today when we were playing, uh, Repo, where it was like,
[16:44.660 --> 16:46.220]  man, I don't, are you okay?
[16:46.220 --> 16:51.040]  Like it just, it, I, it, it's not a thing that I attribute to you,
[16:51.140 --> 16:54.480]  but in like the last, I would say full week, it's a thing where I'm like, geez, Jeff,
[16:54.640 --> 16:55.740]  what is going on?
[16:55.980 --> 17:00.480]  Well, I will say in the last full week, I've been recording and editing
[17:00.480 --> 17:03.640]  like a demon to get ready for this out of town trip.
[17:03.680 --> 17:07.100]  I think this is like my seventh or eighth recording already.
[17:07.440 --> 17:10.700]  And I was out of town for two days to deal with, you know, uh,
[17:10.700 --> 17:13.240]  dealing with a trip and still didn't miss a Mario recording.
[17:13.240 --> 17:16.680]  So I think I might just be at the end of my mental rope.
[17:18.580 --> 17:20.580]  We should lay out all of our mental ropes.
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.440]  Yeah. I think that totally makes sense. I think that totally makes sense.
[17:24.680 --> 17:29.440]  Plus, plus all the other business shit that's happening behind the scenes that we're not like
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.260]  talking about, you know, that has to get done. It's just been a really insane last two weeks
[17:34.260 --> 17:40.780]  in specific. So I think maybe I'm, it's a, it's a combination of my grandmother's genetics and
[17:40.780 --> 17:46.880]  my, uh, just absolute mental exhaustion and probably a little bit of my advanced age.
[17:47.120 --> 17:49.620]  I think we're all feeling it in different ways. I'm,
[17:49.720 --> 17:55.300]  I'm going to all expose myself for a real stupid moment that otherwise would have went unnoticed
[17:55.820 --> 18:01.980]  where a few episodes ago, uh, you were pitching store names with Nick Jeff.
[18:02.080 --> 18:03.680]  Yeah. What were the store names? You remember them?
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.960]  Uh, yeah, it was the Nick and cranny was the first one. And then
[18:07.960 --> 18:14.640]  Nick's snacks was the secondary, like cheaper store. Uh, yeah, more of like an impulse buy
[18:14.640 --> 18:18.520]  store. And then I had a third one that I didn't pitch to you guys, but, uh,
[18:19.100 --> 18:21.640]  I can't quite remember it, but it was something along the same.
[18:22.020 --> 18:29.040]  If you go back and listen to that conversation, I GTA brained it. I wasn't playing GT. I'm just
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.680]  saying it was the same thing with the hot dog fan. If you listen, there's a moment where I
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.880]  say Nick snacks, and I think that I just came up with it and I was very proud of it. And then
[18:38.880 --> 18:44.820]  I brought it up after the fact to my partner of like, Oh, we're talking Nick store names. I said
[18:44.820 --> 18:50.000]  Nick snacks. And I feel, I think that's a very funny name for a Nick store. And then I was told
[18:50.000 --> 18:58.180]  a few days later, uh, Jeff said it like 10 seconds before I did. And it just did not register at all.
[18:58.240 --> 19:03.420]  So I had several days of feeling real good about myself for saying a thing that you
[19:03.420 --> 19:08.740]  already said. It would be so interesting if when you stop recording and say it's
[19:08.740 --> 19:12.980]  like an hour and 10 minutes, it tells you how many minutes of that recording you were just buffering.
[19:17.380 --> 19:21.280]  Do you want to see some, uh, some of the, my mental rope falling apart?
[19:21.700 --> 19:29.300]  Yeah. I had to look at my audio recording folder. Oh no. Uh, just to upload today's
[19:29.300 --> 19:33.420]  I realized I called you called yesterday's part Mario Kart.
[19:35.740 --> 19:37.300]  I just called it Mario Kart.
[19:39.100 --> 19:45.180]  To be honest. Yeah. But like the fact that I see your file in there at all, like that's all I'm
[19:45.180 --> 19:50.060]  looking for and I'm happy. I don't really care what you call it. As long as that file's in there.
[19:50.300 --> 19:56.020]  Good enough. Good enough. Good enough. We'll take it. I have a question relating to files
[19:56.020 --> 20:03.020]  because I had, uh, I made a mistake in a recent Mario party day where I backed out of the game
[20:03.540 --> 20:11.940]  and we had to redo a turn very controversially. And, uh, the recording Gavin's been very opposed.
[20:12.040 --> 20:17.640]  We typically tail sync is very adamant that we don't need to for our average, I'd say like 10
[20:17.640 --> 20:23.020]  minute videos, which is fine. Um, but that would ended up being like 23 minutes because of my
[20:23.020 --> 20:28.400]  mistake. And I requested a tail sync at the end of it, just cause it was a technical difficulties
[20:28.400 --> 20:34.600]  thing. I'm curious at what point are you happy with a tail sync? Just so I know, like, cause I
[20:34.600 --> 20:38.840]  didn't know, cause I brought it up and I didn't want to annoy you by making you do it. But I,
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.140]  I genuinely don't know where the threshold is of what is the minimum recording time
[20:43.140 --> 20:48.940]  required for you to happily do a tail sync. It's not always for, it's not always for drift. If you
[20:48.940 --> 20:53.780]  missed the, if your recording stopped and you had to start it again, you don't have a first sync.
[20:53.820 --> 20:57.980]  So you need a tail sync. I understand. But the reason you don't want to do it for an eight
[20:57.980 --> 21:01.120]  minute thing is because there's no drift. You've been very adamant about it. He just wants to know
[21:01.120 --> 21:07.500]  when drift starts. So I'm curious when you are okay with a back tail sync occurring as a group.
[21:08.200 --> 21:14.360]  But what's my threshold? Yeah. Cause you, you said bad eight minutes, 10 minutes, not enough.
[21:14.360 --> 21:20.580]  So I'm curious, where is that line? Just so I know, cause I don't want to inconvenience you.
[21:20.800 --> 21:25.140]  So I have a lot. So if it's like, okay, it's less than this, I'm not even going to broach it.
[21:25.260 --> 21:29.920]  It's over this. But you don't understand what you're syncing to. Doesn't matter. You're relevant.
[21:30.840 --> 21:35.660]  It's an irrelevant point that you're making. It's not, it's not a concept just for us. It's like
[21:35.660 --> 21:41.140]  tail sticks on a film set. No, but the point is, is that there's a safeguard for people that put
[21:41.140 --> 21:47.020]  this together. That's not my job, but my job is to help enforce that safeguard. And you're opposed
[21:47.020 --> 21:52.040]  to it. Understandably so. I'm not saying you're wrong. Like once I want it, I knew that this
[21:52.040 --> 21:56.360]  was going to turn into like a heated thing with you. I'm not attacking you. I want it to be clear.
[21:56.640 --> 22:01.320]  I just don't know where is the line for like, just so I know. Cause when I brought up doing
[22:01.320 --> 22:06.100]  the tail sync at 23 minutes, I was like, I don't want to annoy Gavin, but this is twice as long.
[22:06.100 --> 22:12.120]  Is this acceptable in his eyes? I mean, I've never noticed any perceivable drift,
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.220]  like under 40 minutes. Okay. So 40 minutes is the line. But I mean,
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.020]  people don't always drift from each other. They don't, but there's a safeguard in case they do.
[22:21.320 --> 22:24.440]  Is the point. Yeah. But here's the thing. Most of the time you're safe. It'd be like,
[22:24.500 --> 22:29.280]  if we were in a haunted house, you've got like a shield, but instead of standing in front of us
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.180]  and protecting us from the dragon, you're standing in front of a bowl of fruit. It doesn't make any
[22:33.180 --> 22:38.400]  sense. Safeguarding us from a dragon in a haunted house? No, a castle or something.
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.880]  Do you think that's what is in a haunted house? Is this because we played Repo earlier?
[22:43.980 --> 22:50.300]  Yeah. I've got Repo on the monitor. Is a dragon in the haunted house?
[22:51.760 --> 22:54.900]  Dragon isn't a ghost. It's like you're standing there
[22:54.900 --> 22:57.360]  with the fire extinguisher, but we're all freezing cold.
[23:00.640 --> 23:03.880]  Okay. I think you're making a point.
[23:04.720 --> 23:07.660]  He's making a point, but it's irrelevant to what I'm saying.
[23:08.060 --> 23:10.140]  You're protecting us from something that hasn't occurred.
[23:10.600 --> 23:15.760]  Yes, but I'm saying the point of my question was, I'm trying to figure out when you think it could.
[23:16.320 --> 23:18.680]  I don't know, 40 minutes? Okay, that's all I wanted.
[23:20.900 --> 23:24.180]  That was a long way around 40 minutes.
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.100]  God damn.
[23:28.220 --> 23:33.600]  I've edited videos for 10 years without tail syncs. If it drifts, you just chop it somewhere
[23:33.600 --> 23:37.680]  in the middle, slide over a bit. So Gavin is against tail syncs in general,
[23:37.800 --> 23:40.740]  unless somebody drops a recording. No, I love them.
[23:41.540 --> 23:43.620]  I don't agree with that. I love them when they're necessary.
[23:43.720 --> 23:48.660]  It sounds like he's arguing against them. We used to not do any kind of
[23:48.660 --> 23:50.280]  tail sync at all. That's true.
[23:50.700 --> 23:53.660]  Do you remember that? Like early Minecraft, we'd all just start recording and start talking.
[23:54.400 --> 24:01.400]  Well, we were inventing the medium, you know. We hadn't figured out all the rules quite yet.
[24:01.620 --> 24:03.940]  I used to do it in Minecraft, like if someone opened the door,
[24:04.100 --> 24:08.120]  I would find the door sound on everyone's footage and I'd sync it like that.
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.100]  God damn.
[24:10.980 --> 24:14.500]  I'd love to see what the video was that we first sunk, you know.
[24:14.920 --> 24:19.960]  I think it was episode three. Oh, maybe. Achievement C.
[24:20.460 --> 24:22.480]  Okay. All right. There you go.
[24:24.260 --> 24:27.900]  Raise the rudders. Raise the sails. Raise the sails.
[24:28.360 --> 24:31.000]  Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching. Over.
[24:31.480 --> 24:35.460]  Roger. Wait, is that an enterprise sales solution?

[24:54.220 --> 24:56.780]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.480]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[25:00.940 --> 25:02.720]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,

[25:10.620 --> 25:14.380]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[25:14.740 --> 25:16.600]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[25:19.540 --> 25:24.300]  So I have three things I want to give you guys the opportunity to pick.
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.860]  I have a game that I've created for you that I think you will absolutely hate.
[25:29.620 --> 25:33.820]  I have a dark mystery that has unfolded in my life.
[25:34.060 --> 25:37.560]  And I have a very fun... this is kind of like at the end of Ridiculousness
[25:37.560 --> 25:39.880]  when he gives them the prompt, which you get two prompts,
[25:39.940 --> 25:41.740]  and you pick which one you get, and then you watch the clip.
[25:41.920 --> 25:44.220]  Of course, in that case, it's usually the same clip.
[25:44.320 --> 25:46.260]  They just give you two prompts that work for the same clip,
[25:46.300 --> 25:47.300]  so it's the illusion of choice.
[25:47.500 --> 25:48.620]  This is actual choice.
[25:48.700 --> 25:52.360]  The third idea is a fun little word game I came up with,
[25:52.480 --> 25:54.200]  movie game I came up with at the airport
[25:54.200 --> 25:56.920]  when I was waiting on American Airlines to get their shit together
[25:56.920 --> 25:58.000]  for four hours the other day.
[25:58.620 --> 25:59.180]  So there you go.
[25:59.560 --> 26:02.980]  Dark mystery, game you'll hate, fun little mall word game.
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.280]  I figure we'll get to the mall eventually,
[26:04.440 --> 26:06.520]  but just fucking which one are we going to do today?
[26:06.520 --> 26:08.480]  Should we all post our votes in the chat at the same time?
[26:09.000 --> 26:09.680]  Okay, okay.
[26:09.820 --> 26:10.220]  Just type the number.
[26:10.980 --> 26:11.140]  Okay.
[26:11.340 --> 26:12.120]  All right, so let's go.
[26:12.240 --> 26:14.300]  Let's, for a point of clarity, the number...
[26:14.300 --> 26:15.800]  Let's order this, all right?
[26:15.860 --> 26:16.000]  Yep.
[26:16.100 --> 26:18.020]  So the first will be game you hate.
[26:18.320 --> 26:18.760]  Okay.
[26:19.120 --> 26:20.000]  That's number one.
[26:20.320 --> 26:21.980]  Dark mystery is number two.
[26:22.300 --> 26:22.740]  Okay.
[26:23.560 --> 26:26.460]  Number three is fun movie word game.
[26:26.680 --> 26:28.600]  Okay, here we go.
[26:28.700 --> 26:29.580]  On three.
[26:30.600 --> 26:32.440]  One, two, three.
[26:33.060 --> 26:34.880]  Ooh, two, two, one, two.
[26:34.880 --> 26:35.980]  Dark mystery.
[26:37.040 --> 26:38.600]  I just want to make sure we get the mystery,
[26:38.700 --> 26:40.820]  because we're going to get a game no matter what it sounds like.
[26:40.880 --> 26:42.020]  Sounds like we're going to get at least two of these.
[26:42.220 --> 26:43.500]  Yeah, I'm with Andrew.
[26:43.560 --> 26:44.980]  I really want to know what the dark mystery is.
[26:47.000 --> 26:47.680]  How graphic...
[26:47.680 --> 26:48.740]  Oh, God.
[26:49.600 --> 26:50.770]  Visually, can I be...
[26:52.260 --> 26:55.580]  If I sent you guys a photo, this photo probably will not make it on air.
[26:55.620 --> 26:56.360]  Oh, Jesus.
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.020]  Oh, God, I'm nervous now.
[26:58.360 --> 26:59.020]  What the...
[26:59.020 --> 27:00.660]  How dark is this mystery, dude?
[27:01.680 --> 27:02.740]  It's pretty gross.
[27:03.020 --> 27:03.860]  Did you find a dead body?
[27:04.240 --> 27:04.600]  Yes.
[27:04.780 --> 27:05.780]  As a matter of fact, I did.
[27:05.940 --> 27:09.940]  I have stumbled upon a serial killer that lives in my yard.
[27:10.900 --> 27:14.560]  Sometime last fall, next to my trash can,
[27:15.020 --> 27:16.520]  I want to say like maybe October, November,
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.600]  there was a bird, a big bird that had been just ripped to shreds, right?
[27:23.720 --> 27:25.440]  And I thought like, oh, that's hideous.
[27:25.480 --> 27:26.480]  What could have got it?
[27:26.500 --> 27:27.140]  It's so gross.
[27:27.200 --> 27:29.340]  And I had to like grab it before Albert could get to it.
[27:29.540 --> 27:30.620]  And I didn't think anything of it.
[27:30.700 --> 27:32.460]  I threw, you know, disposed of it.
[27:32.460 --> 27:36.560]  And went about my life, completely forgot about the incident.
[27:36.720 --> 27:42.040]  And then about two months ago, I found a bird in the same spot, beheaded.
[27:42.700 --> 27:43.640]  Oh, my God.
[27:43.640 --> 27:44.440]  And there was no head.
[27:44.720 --> 27:46.540]  It was just the bird's body and no head.
[27:47.900 --> 27:53.780]  Then one month ago, in the exact same spot, I found just a dead little bird.
[27:54.260 --> 27:56.500]  It didn't have any signs of mauling or anything.
[27:56.640 --> 27:57.380]  So I thought, oh, OK.
[27:57.900 --> 27:59.140]  So I got...
[27:59.140 --> 28:01.500]  Yesterday, I left to go to the post office for a bit.
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.620]  And you know how like when you walk outside, sometimes you're hit with the stench of death?
[28:07.100 --> 28:07.240]  Uh-huh.
[28:07.260 --> 28:07.380]  Yeah.
[28:07.580 --> 28:10.220]  And I was like, oh, my God, it was overpowering.
[28:10.500 --> 28:13.920]  And so I thought maybe there's like a rat in a rat trap or something.
[28:13.920 --> 28:14.280]  I don't know.
[28:14.340 --> 28:15.380]  So I thought I should investigate.
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.640]  And on the other side of my house, in the exact same spot, but on the other side of my house,
[28:19.700 --> 28:22.320]  like my house has two like runways that run along the side.
[28:22.400 --> 28:23.380]  It's like a thin yard, you know?
[28:23.760 --> 28:24.000]  Uh-huh.
[28:24.080 --> 28:26.360]  On the other side, I found a photo.
[28:27.120 --> 28:27.800]  Well, I didn't find the photo.
[28:27.860 --> 28:30.040]  I took a photo and I'll send it to you.
[28:31.720 --> 28:34.340]  This is things have accelerated.
[28:35.060 --> 28:36.480]  Oh, oh, my God.
[28:36.720 --> 28:39.920]  Took a squirrel and ripped it in half.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.020]  This is crazy.
[28:41.620 --> 28:43.460]  Oh, you should you should delete that photo now.
[28:43.840 --> 28:43.980]  Shredded.
[28:44.220 --> 28:48.700]  There is a serial killer that lives in my tiny little yard.
[28:48.840 --> 28:51.420]  And I think now it knows that I know.
[28:51.800 --> 28:53.340]  That's two squirrels.
[28:53.400 --> 28:54.160]  That's two, yeah.
[28:54.740 --> 28:58.060]  No, it's actually the squirrel ripped in half, I think.
[28:58.540 --> 29:01.440]  But it has two back legs and a back leg on the other one.
[29:01.500 --> 29:02.120]  Yeah.
[29:03.160 --> 29:04.160]  It's two squirrels.
[29:04.200 --> 29:05.720]  That's a squirrel and a half then.
[29:05.860 --> 29:06.840]  Yeah, it is a squirrel and a half.
[29:06.860 --> 29:07.540]  That is a squirrel and a half.
[29:07.560 --> 29:08.420]  That's a squirrel and a half.
[29:08.580 --> 29:10.360]  I would say it's like three quarters of a squirrel.
[29:10.620 --> 29:14.140]  Yeah, can you do me a favor and delete the photo of the one and a half squirrels, please?
[29:14.200 --> 29:14.600]  Thank you.
[29:14.720 --> 29:15.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:15.440 --> 29:15.820]  No problem.
[29:16.040 --> 29:19.960]  I it's it's a it's a hideous photo for sure.
[29:20.640 --> 29:25.200]  That's my dark mystery is that I am now aware that there is something that is hunting animals
[29:25.200 --> 29:28.560]  and not just killing them for nourishment, I assume,
[29:28.560 --> 29:33.420]  but as some sort of an expression of anger and mental illness.
[29:33.600 --> 29:35.520]  Do you need to borrow a security camera?
[29:36.440 --> 29:38.700]  You know what I need? That's the next step.
[29:38.820 --> 29:41.000]  I need to set up security cameras in those two spots.
[29:41.280 --> 29:42.680]  We got to see what's going on.
[29:42.800 --> 29:43.540]  Yeah, we should do that.
[29:43.580 --> 29:45.120]  Do you need to borrow a pellet gun?
[29:45.460 --> 29:48.100]  Like, what the fuck, dude? This is crazy.
[29:48.380 --> 29:49.300]  I don't know.
[29:49.420 --> 29:53.320]  And so another thing is I thought like Emily and I were talking about it and I thought,
[29:53.420 --> 29:56.100]  well, maybe it's a raccoon or something.
[29:56.100 --> 29:59.600]  But it I don't know that a raccoon could rip something up like that.
[29:59.640 --> 30:01.340]  And I don't know that it would leave that much behind.
[30:01.480 --> 30:04.360]  So it's probably a bird like an owl or some kind of bird of prey.
[30:04.480 --> 30:08.480]  But we have one of those haiku boxes that records every bird that comes within,
[30:08.480 --> 30:10.420]  you know, 10 feet of our yard or whatever.
[30:10.640 --> 30:12.680]  And there's been nothing on the recording.
[30:12.840 --> 30:16.340]  So there have been no birds that could do this kind of damage.
[30:16.340 --> 30:17.520]  So I really don't know.
[30:17.820 --> 30:21.060]  But and there's no cats, by the way, not there's no like yard cats around us.
[30:21.080 --> 30:22.180]  I was we were talking about that.
[30:22.260 --> 30:24.240]  And I realized I don't think I've seen a cat in my neighborhood yet.
[30:24.240 --> 30:27.000]  So I really don't know what it is.
[30:27.220 --> 30:27.720]  How did it get?
[30:27.840 --> 30:30.440]  Firstly, it got two squirrels and put them in the same place.
[30:30.860 --> 30:32.720]  Yeah, that's real weird.
[30:33.140 --> 30:34.240]  It is weird, right?
[30:34.660 --> 30:37.240]  Pack a squirrel, maybe the squirrels go in packs.
[30:37.620 --> 30:39.540]  I don't know if you can tell, but next to one of those squirrels.
[30:39.620 --> 30:41.720]  Well, it's gone now, but there was a bunch of dryer lint.
[30:41.840 --> 30:44.320]  So I think they must have found the squirrel in its nest
[30:44.320 --> 30:52.440]  and like ripped or them out of including the fabric of its nest, wherever that was.
[30:52.440 --> 30:57.540]  I think we as a show should send Jeff a child detective set
[30:57.540 --> 31:01.780]  and then get an update once he receives it and he can do a thorough investigation.
[31:03.020 --> 31:04.340]  Figure out everything he needs.
[31:04.560 --> 31:06.560]  Jeff, Jeff, you can be Encyclopedia Brown.
[31:06.940 --> 31:08.320]  I can be Encyclopedia Brown.
[31:08.360 --> 31:11.920]  I would like to solve this outside of the the the library, but
[31:13.320 --> 31:17.000]  I think that the cameras and maybe some sort of junior detective kit,
[31:17.060 --> 31:18.140]  we could get to the bottom of this.
[31:18.180 --> 31:21.160]  But I'm I'm real disturbed now because things seem to be accelerating.
[31:21.160 --> 31:24.140]  Did I ever show you where my bin filled up with water?
[31:24.940 --> 31:27.280]  Yes, it suffocated something, right?
[31:27.860 --> 31:29.560]  Yeah, something drowned in it.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.840]  Yeah, there's a raccoon or something or a possum.
[31:33.260 --> 31:37.000]  Yeah, I don't think you showed it, but I remember hearing about this.
[31:37.760 --> 31:40.320]  Oh, God, I see the preview image.
[31:40.400 --> 31:40.780]  I'm good.
[31:41.020 --> 31:42.460]  What is that?
[31:42.960 --> 31:43.660]  I don't know.
[31:44.100 --> 31:48.440]  I just I just walked out and I smelt I smelt death.
[31:49.020 --> 31:50.620]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[31:50.620 --> 31:52.300]  You might want to call APD.
[31:55.020 --> 31:56.560]  That that looks like a crud.
[31:56.700 --> 31:58.720]  I thought that's way worse than what I showed you.
[31:58.820 --> 31:59.820]  Oh, my God.
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  Check your water filter.
[32:01.240 --> 32:03.060]  Delete that filter.
[32:04.840 --> 32:09.880]  Yeah, at some point that bin became because I lost the lid at some point
[32:10.300 --> 32:13.420]  and it became so filled with water that I couldn't move it anymore.
[32:13.520 --> 32:17.020]  And I thought I should kick that over at some point because the water's in it.
[32:17.020 --> 32:22.140]  Next time I next time I came out, smelt death and there was a rotten animal in it.
[32:23.060 --> 32:25.880]  Dude, you know, that's just a mosquito breeding ground.
[32:26.120 --> 32:27.280]  Oh, yeah.
[32:27.320 --> 32:28.280]  Open water like that.
[32:28.280 --> 32:29.040]  That was thousands of them.
[32:29.160 --> 32:29.580]  That was rough.
[32:30.860 --> 32:32.560]  There was a dunk in there or something.
[32:33.520 --> 32:35.900]  Funny, you forget your lid and the consequences.
[32:36.360 --> 32:39.520]  That animal goes through whatever that experienced.
[32:40.180 --> 32:42.420]  Yeah, and I wonder if it can get out because it's just a bin.
[32:42.520 --> 32:44.240]  You think it could just reach up, but I guess not.
[32:45.200 --> 32:45.640]  Yeah, I don't know.
[32:45.640 --> 32:47.300]  And then it looked like something ate it.
[32:47.660 --> 32:50.200]  Well, I think it just got bloated and split open.
[32:50.720 --> 32:53.680]  It makes me wonder if it fell in when it was much more shallow.
[32:54.060 --> 32:56.500]  It died and then the rain lifted it closer to the surface.
[32:59.440 --> 33:00.240]  What a combo.
[33:01.140 --> 33:01.500]  Yeah.
[33:03.020 --> 33:03.960]  Careful of your bins.
[33:04.220 --> 33:05.520]  I yeah, I don't know, Jeff.
[33:05.960 --> 33:09.340]  I don't know what I have no answers to your mystery at this current time.
[33:09.660 --> 33:15.480]  Well, we can try the I mean, I'm discovering and putting the pieces together in real time,
[33:15.480 --> 33:18.700]  you know, and so this is all very fresh and new to me, even though this has been something
[33:18.700 --> 33:21.100]  that's going on technically since last October.
[33:21.100 --> 33:23.400]  I didn't realize that there was a pattern until yesterday.
[33:24.400 --> 33:30.980]  And and so so yeah, I'm I'm really interested in the idea of setting up some webcams and
[33:30.980 --> 33:36.200]  seeing if we can figure it out, because while I think it's probably just an owl or some bird
[33:36.200 --> 33:41.320]  that's doing it very quietly and avoiding my haiku box bird detection, like maybe it's
[33:41.320 --> 33:45.400]  like who knows, maybe it's like an owl that was in some sort of an owl gang.
[33:45.400 --> 33:49.100]  And suffered like it's maybe it's larynx got cut or something.
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.780]  And so I can't make owl noises anymore.
[33:50.940 --> 33:52.240]  And it's got like a cool owl scar.
[33:52.360 --> 33:53.780]  So it's like a silent killer.
[33:54.400 --> 34:01.320]  But I am a little worried that it might be some sort of a satanic small animal ring that's
[34:01.320 --> 34:03.340]  doing blood sacrifices in my yard.
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.740]  So if it's like maybe like a couple of possums and my neighbor has chickens, like who knows
[34:07.740 --> 34:08.460]  what it could be.
[34:08.560 --> 34:09.220]  Oh, the chickens.
[34:09.660 --> 34:11.960]  It's definitely not the chickens, but they could be a part of.
[34:12.180 --> 34:12.580]  Absolutely.
[34:12.580 --> 34:17.840]  They could be a part of some sort of a, you know, a dark ritual, perhaps.
[34:18.480 --> 34:19.600]  I think they're just being left there.
[34:19.720 --> 34:21.300]  I don't think that's where the murders are happening.
[34:21.500 --> 34:25.560]  That's what I was wondering, too, because there's a lack of gore on the crime scene.
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.980]  Although it has been raining a lot.
[34:27.060 --> 34:28.220]  It could have washed the gore out.
[34:28.380 --> 34:29.200]  That's a good point.
[34:29.800 --> 34:33.660]  That's an excellent point is that they could be being brought there.
[34:34.200 --> 34:42.970]  And I am missing half a squirrel, about a third of that other squirrel.
[34:42.970 --> 34:45.450]  And then the head for that one bird are just gone.
[34:45.750 --> 34:49.190]  So maybe they're at the site of attack or who knows?
[34:49.330 --> 34:49.850]  God knows.
[34:50.030 --> 34:53.270]  But I'm just hoping that doesn't it doesn't escalate any further.
[34:53.370 --> 34:55.330]  And I'm going to keep you guys keep you guys updated.
[34:55.570 --> 34:59.770]  And maybe we'll work out some sort of a camera situation and the junior detective kit.
[35:00.030 --> 35:03.570]  This is a weird thing where I'm processing.
[35:03.870 --> 35:07.310]  I don't actually think I want you to solve this because I don't want that footage.
[35:07.690 --> 35:11.090]  Whatever is occurring, I don't think I need to see that.
[35:11.490 --> 35:14.350]  Yeah, but it's not going to on a night vision camera.
[35:14.430 --> 35:15.890]  It's not going to be as gruesome as the picture.
[35:16.510 --> 35:21.050]  Also, you don't think that if you saw a raccoon and a possum and an owl in a circle
[35:21.050 --> 35:26.210]  in robes performing some dark incantation on a squirrel, you're going to want to see that?
[35:26.350 --> 35:27.210]  No, I'm going to want to see it.
[35:27.590 --> 35:29.270]  They got little robes on. I want to see that.
[35:29.450 --> 35:31.850]  Or what if it's just a guy pulling up in a car?
[35:31.930 --> 35:34.170]  He opens his window and dumps out a bucket of animal bits.
[35:34.450 --> 35:36.470]  Now Gavin's my number one suspect.
[35:36.830 --> 35:38.370]  That was an insane thing to say.
[35:38.370 --> 35:46.510]  What if it happens to be a British individual living in Texas currently that swings on by?
[35:46.790 --> 35:48.190]  This is Gavin's cucumbers.
[35:49.230 --> 35:52.570]  I think he might be leading this investigation. I think he's dropping clues.
[35:53.230 --> 35:55.190]  No, I don't even kill bugs in that.
[35:56.410 --> 36:01.670]  Right. You just let your buckets do your dirty work and then you deal with the aftermath.
[36:08.760 --> 36:11.040]  You just don't want the bodies on your property.
[36:11.300 --> 36:15.520]  You're not killing them. You're just moving the bodies that have died on your property to Jeff's.
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.720]  I also, you know, we have that serial killer that's killing people around
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.620]  Town Lake. What if they're, what if they're, what if the heat is on
[36:25.620 --> 36:28.000]  and they're just, they got to aim lower?
[36:28.300 --> 36:32.440]  Oh man, they're on to me. I've been killing too many tech bros and dumping them over
[36:32.440 --> 36:39.660]  the bridge. I better cut a squirrel in half, keep one half and dump the other full squirrel
[36:39.660 --> 36:41.540]  in this guy's yard.
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.940]  Also, also what if the other parts to those animals are being dumped in one of my neighbor's
[36:46.940 --> 36:50.720]  yards and they're having a similar discovery right now? You know?
[36:50.780 --> 36:54.160]  I don't, I don't want to be overly morbid, but I feel like the transition is similar
[36:54.160 --> 37:00.860]  from going to Coke to Diet Coke. Like maybe they're trying to experience the same thing,
[37:00.860 --> 37:01.940]  but on a lesser level.
[37:02.400 --> 37:04.880]  A hundred percent. Yeah. Serial killer zero. Yeah.
[37:05.060 --> 37:08.820]  So yeah, like the squirrels are Diet Coke for serial killers.
[37:08.980 --> 37:10.140]  Exactly. Yeah.
[37:10.500 --> 37:10.900]  Wow.
[37:11.440 --> 37:14.060]  Like they've been consuming too much Coke and now...
[37:14.060 --> 37:18.680]  And these are like, I got to be honest. I, each one of these ideas is just as plausible
[37:18.680 --> 37:22.600]  as the next to me. And we're just, I feel like we're just scratching the surface. That's why
[37:22.600 --> 37:26.460]  I want to get to the bottom of it because I got to know, is it the rainy street ripper?
[37:26.460 --> 37:32.560]  Is it an owl? Is it a, just like a murderous owl that had his throat slit in a gang fight?
[37:32.860 --> 37:39.900]  Or is it, uh, is it a dark satanic small animal cult? Like it could be any of a myriad of things.
[37:40.900 --> 37:47.000]  I, you know, if you start getting Zodiac letters, but with creepers in the letters,
[37:47.180 --> 37:49.440]  I'd be Gavin Theory once again. One more Gavin.
[37:51.400 --> 37:53.060]  I think we can't rule Gavin out.
[37:54.600 --> 37:55.480]  Interesting. Interesting.
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.480]  That's exactly what someone who it was would say. Of course you'd say it wasn't you.

[38:48.900 --> 38:55.580]  Geoff, are you aware that the, uh, the audience has a clip? Uh, yeah. What do they have a clip of?
[38:56.200 --> 39:02.220]  Oh, do they have a clip of me saying collab as if that's some sort of a smoking gun?
[39:02.780 --> 39:07.520]  Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Do you know why I hate the word collab? Because
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.260]  I found myself saying it so much and I fucking hearing myself saying it made me hate it.
[39:11.520 --> 39:16.160]  All they're doing is showing me a video of the day I decided never to say the word again.
[39:17.600 --> 39:21.220]  Interesting. Fantastic. Well, that's a good point. I thought that was so strange that they thought
[39:21.220 --> 39:25.700]  that was some sort of a like, we got you. You used to say it. Yeah. I used to drink a lot too. I don't
[39:25.700 --> 39:34.200]  anymore. People stop doing things or cold turkey or they keep doing it, but instead it squirrels now.
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.680]  Half a squirrel for every collab. Anyway, I thought that I thought that clip was useless
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.380]  because all it did was be like, yeah, I can hear myself being annoyed with myself in the clip.
[39:47.520 --> 39:50.280]  Like it should be pretty clear. I don't like saying the word while I'm saying it.
[39:50.520 --> 39:53.020]  I do like the idea of the audience bringing clips though. That's phenomenal. Yeah, I do.
[39:53.080 --> 39:58.620]  I really like it. I think it's great too. Have serial killers ever collabed? Has there ever been
[39:58.620 --> 40:04.380]  a known serial killing collab? Isn't that like most of the Silence of the Lambs sequels? Shipman
[40:04.380 --> 40:12.260]  X West. I mean, in real life. Oh, like, I don't know. Name a famous serial killer. Like discover
[40:12.260 --> 40:17.500]  I'm describing what it sounds like a Dexter season, essentially. Yeah. Yeah. It's the Trinity
[40:17.500 --> 40:23.200]  killer all over. If it happened, it was successful and you don't get to know about it, I guess. Yeah.
[40:23.460 --> 40:28.280]  You know? Yeah. Also, I think serial killers have really slowed down because of technology. You
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.220]  know, it was a serial killers were really prominent in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s when it was
[40:32.220 --> 40:39.680]  harder to catch them. Yeah. Fucking cameras. They take they they they ruin everything. They ruin
[40:39.680 --> 40:48.570]  everything. What a I mean, the surveillance state or whatever complaint like is that
[40:48.570 --> 40:53.650]  that's the positive. We reduce serial killers. I mean, I would think so. I wonder statistically,
[40:53.910 --> 40:57.750]  or is it just more muddled now? I think it's a lot harder to get away with that stuff,
[40:57.790 --> 41:04.510]  especially with DNA evidence and technology. But also, I think the real thing is that there
[41:04.510 --> 41:08.630]  were probably a lot more serial killers back in the day that people didn't know about because
[41:08.630 --> 41:13.510]  people weren't because information wasn't shared as readily and as easily. It was harder to to
[41:13.510 --> 41:17.790]  connect dots. Yeah. I wonder how many people with no friends or family would just disappeared and
[41:17.790 --> 41:23.610]  no one even noticed. Yeah. I'm surprised that with modern tech, there's not more technology
[41:23.610 --> 41:28.210]  based killings. You just don't hear a lot of you don't hear a lot about like a drone with a knife
[41:28.210 --> 41:35.910]  on it or anything. Ignore whatever I was going to say. Let's go down this road. A drone with a knife
[41:35.910 --> 41:41.030]  on it, huh? It's really weird that you don't hear more about a drone with a knife that targets trees
[41:41.030 --> 41:48.010]  with squirrels. It would just be so jarring to get stabbed in the back with a drone. Just swoop down
[41:48.010 --> 41:54.210]  out of nowhere. Walking down, walking down the street and you hear... and all of a sudden, what the hell?
[41:54.990 --> 41:59.410]  I'm imagining that that clip that Drake posted to promote that gambling thing of the drone,
[41:59.530 --> 42:04.030]  like pretending he's trying to destroy the drone that's filming him in his apartment. But if there's
[42:04.030 --> 42:09.510]  a knife on it, that is such a better clip. Just a knife drone flying by. I mean, we did it with
[42:09.510 --> 42:13.650]  Roombas, Jeff. Do you think maybe we should put balloons and knives on drones and see what we
[42:13.650 --> 42:17.730]  could do? I think it's a great idea. And I think that's a terrible idea. That's our next live
[42:17.730 --> 42:21.950]  action video. We need two drones. Why are there balloons? That's the target. That's the heart.
[42:22.150 --> 42:29.550]  Yeah. They're trying to pop each other's balloon. We made a video. OK, I understand. A billion years
[42:29.550 --> 42:34.990]  ago with Roombas and balloons, and it did very well. Yeah, I think drones are the... well, I mean,
[42:35.010 --> 42:38.290]  the nice thing about the Roombas was it was random, right? Because the Roombas have a mind of their
[42:38.290 --> 42:42.810]  own. But I would like... Skill-based. I would like a skill-based knife fight with you, yes.
[42:45.730 --> 42:50.430]  Yeah, there you go. I guess the area would be too wide. I was going to say, is there not like an
[42:50.430 --> 42:54.830]  AI drone type thing where it's like autopilot? We'll steer for you. But I guess they'd probably
[42:54.830 --> 42:58.310]  actively avoid each other. You'd never get... Yeah, you could have them like follow you and
[42:58.310 --> 43:00.610]  stuff, but I don't think you would want the knife one when it's doing that.
[43:03.570 --> 43:10.010]  That's very fair. Can we put like GoPros on the drones? Yeah, here's what we do, right? So you get
[43:10.010 --> 43:16.290]  like a real first... OK, OK, go for it. We'll do it just like Mario Kart 64 battle mode. Three balloons,
[43:17.390 --> 43:26.650]  four players, GoPros on them. I love it. Perfect. Or all indoors. What? Has to be indoors.
[43:26.650 --> 43:31.570]  What? All indoors. You could do it indoors. For legal purposes. A kitchen or something.
[43:32.090 --> 43:36.830]  Yeah. A kitchen? Here's what we'll do. We'll get an office and then we'll do it in our new office.
[43:37.050 --> 43:43.670]  No, no, no, no, no. We can't because that's so close to us. Drones with knives feel like
[43:43.670 --> 43:49.750]  something's going to... What if we play... The knife goes in... No, the knife goes in a rotor.
[43:50.530 --> 43:54.790]  I have a solution. I have a solution, Eric. Don't worry. What if we're outside looking
[43:54.790 --> 44:01.590]  through the windows and operating the drones remotely? Imagine people walking by wondering
[44:01.590 --> 44:07.610]  why four dudes are crouched looking into a building. There's drones and knives in there.
[44:08.090 --> 44:11.090]  It'd be an absolute racket. I think we have to do this. All right, hold on. I'm going to put this
[44:11.090 --> 44:13.810]  on the... We're going to drop this. I'm going to put it on the sheet. I think you guys could
[44:13.810 --> 44:18.450]  get together when Gavin needs to shave and just stand outside and look through a window and
[44:19.990 --> 44:23.230]  make some drones. This is going to be expensive. I've never owned a drone,
[44:23.230 --> 44:27.270]  but I think they're pricey. No, you can't be pricey. They have to be junk drones.
[44:28.130 --> 44:33.550]  But can a junk drone lift a knife? A small one, sure. We don't need a katana on these drones.
[44:33.990 --> 44:37.770]  I think it's got to be scary, though. It's going to be like a big kitchen knife. A big honker of
[44:37.770 --> 44:41.750]  a knife. See, I think it could go either way. I think it could either be incredibly small and
[44:41.750 --> 44:46.550]  ridiculous. What if you draw for knives and there's different sizes? Oh, that's interesting.
[44:48.050 --> 44:51.810]  I like this. I like this a lot. You could potentially pick the biggest knife,
[44:51.810 --> 44:56.250]  but you might have like a front heavy problem. Yeah. Yeah. I really like the idea of that.
[44:56.390 --> 44:59.610]  It's possible to have a badass knife that the drone just cannot lift,
[44:59.710 --> 45:04.070]  but you get no air off of it. It's like a sitting duck dragging along the ground.
[45:05.150 --> 45:09.010]  I think this... I'm writing that down, too. We draw for knives. Yeah, I think this is a good
[45:09.010 --> 45:13.090]  idea, right? Yeah, this is a great idea. And we addressed Eric's safety concerns. Yeah,
[45:13.210 --> 45:18.050]  we'll be outside. This is not addressing my safety concerns whatsoever. Why not?
[45:18.050 --> 45:23.990]  We're set. What can we do to help you out? I don't... We need to be... If we're going to do
[45:23.990 --> 45:28.850]  it indoors, we need a big location, like a big hangar or like a warehouse or something.
[45:29.150 --> 45:34.830]  So we can be at a distance watching this. A rotor is going to get hit with a knife and this thing's
[45:34.830 --> 45:39.570]  going to spin and it's going to gore the slow-mo guy. And it's not... This is just not good.
[45:40.050 --> 45:45.090]  He's outside looking through a window. I don't trust that at all. How about this? What if we
[45:45.090 --> 45:52.130]  have him wear goggles and a neck gaiter? What? To protect his neck so it can't be gored.
[45:52.810 --> 45:58.310]  Neck nose? Yeah. Neck gaiter. Yeah, you know what a neck gaiter is. Why would that protect his neck?
[45:58.790 --> 46:04.350]  It's fabric. The knife's going to have to puncture that before it gets to him.
[46:04.870 --> 46:09.970]  We could put... We could beef it up. We could put stuff in there. Are we going to go FPV or are we
[46:09.970 --> 46:14.890]  just going to be flying based on sight through the window? I don't know. I guess it depends on
[46:14.890 --> 46:19.150]  the drone we have. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, we'll have to investigate because we want to make
[46:19.150 --> 46:25.450]  sure Eric is on board by addressing all of his safety concerns to his satisfaction, while also
[46:25.450 --> 46:30.610]  addressing all of our danger and fun concerns, which require us to do it indoors in a small
[46:30.610 --> 46:36.610]  office. Will this be our first regulation risk assessment? Oh, that's interesting.
[46:37.570 --> 46:39.670]  I assess it as very dangerous.
[46:42.490 --> 46:47.430]  I'm imagining all of the drone shot scenes and ambulance and how terrifying it would be if there
[46:47.430 --> 46:51.950]  was a knife on that thing. Like that's just a horror movie. Imagine just someone putting a
[46:51.950 --> 47:02.230]  knife on all that footage. It'd be so funny. That's a brilliant idea, Gavin. Yeah, I love it.
[47:02.230 --> 47:04.930]  Well done. I made up for your earlier bullshit.
[47:06.490 --> 47:14.570]  No, that's fair. I just it is completely irrelevant, but I'm watching. I have a prop
[47:14.570 --> 47:18.750]  auction up on the side for movies, and this is currently what's up for bid. And I just I just
[47:18.750 --> 47:24.670]  want to I just want to share really quickly. It is a Demolition Man Planet Hollywood Collection
[47:24.670 --> 47:30.550]  cryogenically frozen John Spartan Sylvester Stallone figure. How much is that going for?
[47:30.550 --> 47:39.710]  Currently, 10,000. I think it's sold for 10,000. It looks so bad. It is like a life sized
[47:41.190 --> 47:47.290]  Sylvester Stallone in a very unflattering pose. The least flattering pose. A face that looks like
[47:47.290 --> 47:51.870]  an impersonator. I think in the movie it has bollocks, doesn't it? Well, I think that's a
[47:51.870 --> 47:55.570]  that black thing I think is cover is like Photoshop. I think it's. Oh, yeah. Yeah,
[47:55.570 --> 47:59.210]  I think it's a naked thing because you see it through the tank. Oh, you think it's got a dick?
[47:59.210 --> 48:04.130]  I think it does. Oh, man. It's why else are you buying it? It's not for.
[48:07.710 --> 48:09.530]  I just saw Sylvester Stallone yesterday.
[48:13.910 --> 48:19.870]  I would. Oh, man. Imagine being in person at an auction, seeing the guy who's bidding for that.
[48:20.850 --> 48:24.990]  Ten thousand. One. You gotta have it.
[48:27.210 --> 48:32.490]  The next item up for sale is a departed sign. Like, it's just so funny to me to go from those
[48:32.490 --> 48:38.450]  Stallone naked dick hanging out frozen thing to. Oh, here's just a autograph of the cast of
[48:38.450 --> 48:45.270]  The Departed. Bunch of photos put together. Just the biggest transition. Are you excited about
[48:45.270 --> 48:51.550]  your item, Leah? I'm very excited for us. Watch. I made it. I made a joke. It was too much for
[48:51.550 --> 48:58.910]  the podcast. Thank you. This whole podcast has been too much for the podcast. This has been
[48:59.330 --> 49:03.410]  one that's like way in one direction. Maybe I should do the game you guys are going to hate
[49:03.410 --> 49:10.130]  and just really send it over the edge. Yeah, we should. But I'm just imagining Stallone somehow
[49:10.130 --> 49:14.970]  learning about what you said as a comment, Jeff, and being outraged about it and making a statement.
[49:15.350 --> 49:20.130]  He would be very funny. Oh, he'd be so upset. Oh, yeah. He wouldn't be happy. He would not like it.
[49:20.410 --> 49:23.970]  OK, I wanted to come up with a theme song and stuff, but then I realized I don't know how to do
[49:23.970 --> 49:30.570]  that. But this is a game show I created. This is a game show I created for you guys months ago that
[49:30.570 --> 49:35.170]  I've been holding on to for just the right moment. And since this is an already gross episode and I
[49:35.170 --> 49:40.070]  know that this is going to go very badly and I'll be interested to see if we get through the game.
[49:40.190 --> 49:43.870]  I think that that would be a personal win for me, but I suspect that it'll be one of those things
[49:43.870 --> 49:48.650]  where the audience turns on me and everybody's mad at me for a little while. OK, can you attempt
[49:48.650 --> 49:57.170]  a theme song? Yeah. Yeah. Let me hold on a second. Here we go. It's a fart. No, it's not.
[49:57.390 --> 50:03.410]  Oh, no! We've talked about this! It's everybody's favorite game. I don't want to do this!
[50:03.410 --> 50:07.790]  Is it a fart or is it something else? What's up? That's our song. This has been pitched.
[50:08.470 --> 50:12.270]  Oh, no. This isn't a new game? Yeah, this is our favorite game. We haven't played it yet,
[50:12.330 --> 50:18.510]  so it's new. Is it a fart or is it something else? Now, here's how it works. I'm going to play a
[50:18.510 --> 50:22.990]  clip for you guys, and you have the easiest job in the world. All you have to do is listen to the
[50:22.990 --> 50:27.890]  clip and then you just have to make the determination. That's a fart or it's not.
[50:28.010 --> 50:33.590]  It's something else. And something else could be anything. It could be an Oldsmobile backfiring. It
[50:33.590 --> 50:40.710]  could be a squeaky wheel on a laundry hamper. It could be somebody banging a nail with a hammer.
[50:40.950 --> 50:46.090]  It could be your grandmother saying, I love you. It could be anything in the world other than a
[50:46.090 --> 50:50.050]  fart. You just have to tell me. You don't have to tell me what it is. You don't have to get that
[50:50.050 --> 50:54.250]  right. You don't have to try. You just have to say, no, that's not a fart. So the answer will
[50:54.250 --> 50:58.190]  be A, a fart, or B, something else. And we can play the answer. Yeah, A, a fart, or B, something
[50:58.190 --> 51:04.310]  else. Okay. You guys want to try? Yeah. All right. So I'll just play it off my phone. All right.
[51:04.310 --> 51:08.970]  This is the first one. All right. You just have to tell me. Is it a fart or something else?
[51:11.530 --> 51:19.830]  Oh my God. Now, was that a fart or was it something else? You need like a lifestyle change,
[51:19.870 --> 51:27.670]  I think. Something else. Is everybody want to weigh in? Nick said B. That was full blown poo.
[51:28.710 --> 51:32.190]  Okay. Well, we're not saying what it was. We're just determining Gavin. I think you're the only
[51:32.190 --> 51:37.970]  one who hasn't answered. B. Okay. Gavin says B. That is correct. That was not a fart. That was
[51:37.970 --> 51:43.370]  something else. Do you guys want to hear another one? No. Not really. Oh God. Well, we got to do
[51:43.370 --> 51:46.970]  at least one more. You can't just do a game of one. Let's see. All right. If you guys get it,
[51:46.970 --> 51:52.310]  how about this? If you guys nail this one, you win. All right. What do we win? You don't have to
[51:52.310 --> 51:57.370]  play anymore. Oh, great. Okay. Let's try. Oh, some of these are so long. Fingers crossed for
[51:57.370 --> 52:03.750]  the Oldsmobile. Could be an Oldsmobile. That's correct. You don't never know. You never know.
[52:04.390 --> 52:13.840]  Let's try. Let's try this one. La la la la. Oh my God. Something else. This is the worst game
[52:13.840 --> 52:21.180]  in the world. B. It's definitely B. Everybody's B. Correct. Correct. Correct. That was something
[52:21.180 --> 52:28.760]  else. If you guys want to keep playing, I've got six or seven more prompts that I've prepared.
[52:29.180 --> 52:34.340]  Nobody wants to know. Why have you done this? For this reason. So that I can play the game,
[52:34.460 --> 52:41.120]  fart, or something else. Is it a fart? Or is it not? Is it wet? Or is it hot? Is it a fart?
[52:43.240 --> 52:48.980]  It's always something else. It's always the same. Yeah, the problem is that really the game is just
[52:48.980 --> 52:53.920]  called shit. Unfortunately, we didn't get to a fart because you guys made me cut the game down
[52:53.920 --> 52:58.380]  early, but we might have at some point. We might have at some point. You could have heard something
[52:58.380 --> 53:04.080]  like this. No. No. Okay. All right. What? I was going to play a fart. I mean, should we hear a
[53:04.080 --> 53:10.480]  third just to make sure we give it a chance? No. Why? Fine. Whatever. Do it. You never know.
[53:10.820 --> 53:16.920]  It could be a fart this time. If it is a fart. All right. Let me see if I can find a good clip.
[53:18.340 --> 53:23.000]  Should we release a separate cut of this? Like the palatable edition and then...
[53:23.920 --> 53:32.620]  That was a definite fart. Oh, okay. Gavin missed it. It was A. Yeah. Sorry. That's all right. You
[53:32.620 --> 53:36.640]  guys got it. So you see, there are farts in the mix. Like it wasn't always going to be
[53:36.640 --> 53:42.800]  something else. There are definitely farts. I wasn't gonna do that to you guys. What kind
[53:42.800 --> 53:48.760]  of a game show would that be? That would just be trickery. No. You've gotten in the room at various
[53:49.540 --> 53:53.160]  streaming companies before. Like you've pitched to Netflix and stuff, haven't you? Or like some
[53:53.160 --> 54:00.180]  other company? Every fucking network you know I have pitched to. We could potentially get you back
[54:00.180 --> 54:05.800]  in the room. Like Ramsey's back. He's got new ideas. I want you to go in there and actually
[54:05.800 --> 54:10.260]  pitch that and see how long you get to stay in the building. Oh, dude. I would... Are you kidding?
[54:10.400 --> 54:16.020]  I fucking killed in my TLC pitch. They would love this. Oh, how do we get you back in? Get me back
[54:16.020 --> 54:24.360]  in the room with TLC or Lifetime. They liked me. Netflix is cool. This feels like more of a Netflix
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.620]  idea. I don't know anybody at Hulu. I don't know. Hey, if you're a network executive and you're
[54:29.620 --> 54:35.280]  interested in potentially a radical new game show, fart or something else, hit us up. Email me at
[54:35.280 --> 54:43.500]  ericatjeffsboss.com. David Zaslav is frantically typing. We let him go? Yeah. You heard? You hear
[54:43.500 --> 54:49.480]  this gold? We released this. All right. Well, thank you guys for playing America's favorite new
[54:49.480 --> 54:56.940]  game. Is it a fart or something else? What a shit way to end the episode. Hey! Wait, literally.
[54:58.180 --> 55:06.140]  Oh, something else. You guys want a palate cleanser? Yeah. Yeah. I know. I'm so worried. I
[55:06.140 --> 55:10.800]  was killing time at the airport the other day because my flight got delayed 17 times and I was
[55:10.800 --> 55:17.160]  bored to death. And what I tend to do, my idle mind, instead of listening to podcasts or doing
[55:17.160 --> 55:22.700]  work, I always end up just inventing games to occupy my time. And I played Sloppy Joe's Bingo
[55:22.700 --> 55:26.720]  at the airport for a while with the exact same prompts. And surprisingly, a lot of it works.
[55:27.600 --> 55:33.080]  But even Bingo gets boring if you're just playing by yourself, right? So I came up with a game
[55:34.440 --> 55:41.140]  that is more of like a prompt, like a thought starter kind of game. But I had this idea. Take
[55:41.140 --> 55:48.220]  a movie title and flip it and create another movie out of the title that sounds totally different
[55:48.220 --> 55:53.360]  from the movie. I'll give you an example. Point Break flipped would be Breakpoint, a movie about
[55:53.360 --> 55:58.100]  a guy who's having a terrible day and he's at his breaking point and things just keep getting worse.
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.120]  And can he hold it together, right? So it doesn't work for every movie, right? Because it doesn't
[56:02.120 --> 56:08.320]  change the meaning. Like, Surf Ninjas backwards is just Ninjas Surf. That's not cool. But here are
[56:08.320 --> 56:13.680]  some that I think you'll find that are awesome. White Snow. It's a movie about a woman who's
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.740]  dealing cocaine internationally. White Snow instead of Snow White. Completely flips the
[56:18.740 --> 56:24.620]  game on that. The other ones I came up with? Gump Forest. Don't go into the Gump Forest.
[56:24.980 --> 56:31.620]  You may never come out. It's a horror movie. Wrath of the Grapes. Do not make eye contact
[56:31.620 --> 56:37.480]  with the grapes. They're very angry. Dog Reservoir. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to go
[56:37.480 --> 56:44.520]  down there. Society Poets Dead. It's a movie about a serial killer who's targeting society
[56:44.520 --> 56:52.700]  poets, high society poets. Father God. Father God. Story of Jesus. Father God is a great one. The story
[56:52.700 --> 56:58.820]  of Jesus and his dad. And then the other one I had was The Giant Iron, which is a story about a
[56:58.820 --> 57:03.200]  community that needed a roadside attraction, and they didn't have a claim to fame, so they built
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.000]  the world's largest iron, but then they didn't actually... there was one that they just weren't
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.160]  aware of that was even larger, and it all ended up in failure. It was a sad movie. And those are
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.880]  those are the ones that I was able to come up with when... Summer, I know what you did last.
[57:15.240 --> 57:22.860]  That's a great one, Nick. Thank you. We'll say a film that I personally thought was shit, not
[57:22.860 --> 57:35.300]  great action, was 3. Battle was not compelling. Ended very quickly. It's pretty good. I saw a
[57:35.300 --> 57:39.760]  really cool science fiction movie about this ship that went out of control. It's called Struck Moon.
[57:43.360 --> 57:44.500]  Our Rush.
[57:47.300 --> 57:50.400]  It's surprisingly hard to come up with them. Bull raging.
[57:50.400 --> 57:55.880]  It's just a pissed off bull, and he's got a score to settle. That's a good one. That's a good one.
[57:56.020 --> 57:59.880]  I like the golden man with the gun. You're just reworking titles, though, Nick. That's not...
[58:01.300 --> 58:05.940]  Nick's having fun. But he's a gold man, and he has a gun. You gotta turn it backwards, though.
[58:06.340 --> 58:09.560]  Nick's just having a good time. Oh, it's not backwards. He's just shifting it around.
[58:11.280 --> 58:12.200]  Bandetta for V.
[58:15.540 --> 58:19.480]  Uh, Poppins Mary. It's a breakdancing woman in the 1980s.
[58:21.620 --> 58:28.740]  Ooh, air con. About air conditioning? No, you're running an elaborate con in an airplane.
[58:30.300 --> 58:34.700]  Bud Air. It's about this new strain of weed that's released
[58:34.700 --> 58:39.500]  into the oxygenation system, and everybody gets high.
[58:42.960 --> 58:49.180]  Oh, no, it's about the Bud Air. It's a docudrama about the nation's first
[58:49.180 --> 58:56.940]  weed-based airplane service. Oh, like a Soul Plane type thing, maybe? Yeah, like Soul Plane,
[58:57.100 --> 59:00.820]  but it's kind of like weed tourism. So you get on and you get high while you get high.
[59:00.980 --> 59:03.920]  It's a whole thing. Barrel smoking, too, and stock lock.
[59:12.400 --> 59:15.780]  Anyway, I just throw that out there for you guys if you ever get bored. It's a
[59:15.780 --> 59:19.980]  good way to entertain yourself for about, I don't know, 12 minutes. I mean, trying to come up with
[59:19.980 --> 59:24.420]  two-word movie titles, just trying to think of a bunch of two-word movie titles is, like, tough.
[59:24.860 --> 59:29.500]  It is. It is. I just read... eventually I gave up and just went down lists of best movies
[59:29.500 --> 59:36.520]  for a while. Ice Snake. That's a good one. Hustle American. Just an American guy who
[59:36.520 --> 59:41.000]  just can't stop. He's just going. He's running across the country. I love that. What's great
[59:41.000 --> 59:46.980]  about so many of these is I read them as Yoda. Oh, that's pretty good. Ice Snake feels like a
[59:46.980 --> 59:58.100]  Yoda thing. Sea Blue Deep. Yeah, that's a shockingly fun game. Yeah, I like it. Well,
[59:58.140 --> 01:00:03.720]  thank American Express. Thank American Airlines. Express. Thanks, American Express. Thank Airlines
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:10.760]  America. Thank you. I'll have a little movie thing for the next episode that I'm excited to share.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.240]  Oh, that's nice. Very exciting. I stumbled onto something. Well, let's end this podcast so that
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.920]  we can wait a week and then find out. And if you're listening to the clean version,
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.500]  this is probably about 40 minutes long. Oh, gosh. This one got a little out of control.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.480]  We'll get it back. Yeah, we'll be back. We'll bounce back. I wouldn't count on it.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.380]  We'll bounce back, unlike the small dead animals in my yard. We'll see you next week. Don't forget
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:41.700]  to tell somebody you know about this podcast. Maybe not this episode, but an episode. And as
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:49.360]  always, we love you. Bye bye. Bye. Bye. Gavin, should we tailsync? It's more than 40 minutes.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.480]  I'm just checking.
