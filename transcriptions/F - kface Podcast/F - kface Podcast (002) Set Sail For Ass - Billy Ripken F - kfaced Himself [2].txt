[00:00.000 --> 00:02.480]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico.
[00:02.940 --> 00:04.980]  Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[00:05.460 --> 00:10.460]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[00:10.560 --> 00:12.380]  but they found something unexpected instead.
[00:12.780 --> 00:17.260]  It was still crisp, lively, and smooth, but it had nothing to do with waves.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.140]  It was Pacifico, a delicious Mexican lager.
[00:20.600 --> 00:22.600]  It's like it was brewed to be discovered.
[00:23.240 --> 00:25.020]  Pacifico, find your own way.

[00:40.820 --> 00:43.880]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of F*** Face,
[00:44.260 --> 00:46.840]  a podcast about shooting yourself in the foot for a laugh.
[00:47.120 --> 00:48.460]  I am your host, Geoff Ramsey.
[00:48.760 --> 00:58.340]  And as always, thus far, my co-hosts are Gavin Free and Andrew Panton, two millennial idiots.
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.240]  Hello!
[00:59.860 --> 01:00.280]  Hey!
[01:00.560 --> 01:01.520]  That's not very nice, is it?
[01:01.660 --> 01:04.900]  How dare you call Canada's greatest gamer a millennial idiot?
[01:05.300 --> 01:06.020]  What an insult.
[01:06.020 --> 01:10.620]  How dare someone fart about with their microphone for 15 minutes,
[01:10.900 --> 01:13.740]  like a total boomer, and then come at us with millennials?
[01:14.180 --> 01:17.460]  Dude, if I was a boomer, we still wouldn't be recording right now.
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.420]  It's only because of my Gen X sensibilities that I was able to overcome
[01:24.160 --> 01:27.240]  all of these technical problems, which, by the way, I have every day.
[01:27.420 --> 01:31.060]  I like we go into... I go into defensive mode when I get called a millennial,
[01:31.160 --> 01:32.500]  but it's like, well, I am a millennial.
[01:32.500 --> 01:33.260]  All right.
[01:33.920 --> 01:37.160]  Well, it was meant as an insult, so...
[01:37.160 --> 01:38.320]  That's what I do, yeah.
[01:38.460 --> 01:40.360]  You were correct in being offended.
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.620]  Hey, so I wanted to talk to you guys about something that I found out the other night,
[01:47.180 --> 01:51.820]  because I had some insomnia and I couldn't sleep, so I was doing some research on f***-facing.
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.040]  And I found something to... I found out something illuminating.
[01:56.300 --> 01:57.540]  I wanted to share it with you guys.
[01:57.880 --> 02:01.160]  So, f***-face is a word that's been around for a long time.
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.800]  Andrew and I started using it in a particular way,
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.720]  but it kind of came back into our, I guess,
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.240]  parlance because Andrew and I started collecting cards together.
[02:14.400 --> 02:16.160]  Not really because I want to collect cards,
[02:16.220 --> 02:18.720]  but it was just something to do with Andrew and it's kind of...
[02:18.720 --> 02:19.640]  It's just like a fun thing we do.
[02:19.740 --> 02:21.080]  We open basketball cards together.
[02:21.240 --> 02:22.460]  He's not your son.
[02:23.380 --> 02:24.920]  No, he's my friend. I don't know.
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.340]  You know what?
[02:27.420 --> 02:30.560]  Sounds like my least favorite son is jealous of my favorite son.
[02:30.560 --> 02:31.680]  Jealous to s***, dude.
[02:31.920 --> 02:32.660]  That's what I'm hearing.
[02:33.200 --> 02:35.020]  Well, you got something that Andrew didn't,
[02:35.100 --> 02:36.340]  and we can talk about it in a little while, too.
[02:36.580 --> 02:38.020]  Anyway, through the course of that,
[02:38.120 --> 02:39.740]  Andrew started and I talked about like,
[02:39.800 --> 02:41.320]  you know, I used to collect baseball cards when I was a kid.
[02:41.540 --> 02:44.400]  We started talking about like silly sports cards,
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.760]  and we got in this discussion of what is like the most collectible card of all time.
[02:49.860 --> 02:52.000]  And to me, a lot of people would say it's probably
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.340]  like a Honus Wagner or Michael Jordan rookie card or whatever.
[02:54.340 --> 03:02.080]  To me, it was a 1989 Fleer baseball card of the little brother of Cal Ripken,
[03:02.240 --> 03:06.180]  who's a very famous Baltimore Oriole, named Billy Ripken,
[03:06.540 --> 03:11.380]  who his 89 Fleer card is him holding a baseball bat, smiling,
[03:11.560 --> 03:14.400]  and on the bat it says f*** face on the bottom of the bat.
[03:14.660 --> 03:18.640]  And this went to print and it was very quickly corrected,
[03:18.960 --> 03:22.580]  but it became for a while a really funny collectible baseball card
[03:22.580 --> 03:27.720]  that in 89 was going for like a thousand dollars for a brief period in time.
[03:27.900 --> 03:31.140]  Like everybody was clamoring to get their hand on the f*** face card,
[03:31.220 --> 03:32.520]  myself included. I was 14.
[03:33.180 --> 03:35.560]  And Andrew and I were talking about it.
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.280]  I lamented that I never, never got that f*** face card.
[03:38.480 --> 03:41.660]  So he very sweetly bought me a box of Fleer baseball cards,
[03:41.760 --> 03:42.760]  bought himself one from 89.
[03:42.840 --> 03:45.640]  And we opened up packs until we both got the f*** face card.
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.940]  I suspect, by the way, that Andrew very kindly opened up all the packs,
[03:51.940 --> 03:54.060]  found that there wasn't one in there, slipped one in,
[03:54.420 --> 03:55.740]  packaged it back up and sent it to me.
[03:56.080 --> 03:58.260]  I will go to my grave believing that he did that.
[03:58.600 --> 04:00.800]  I considered it. Honestly, what happened was,
[04:01.860 --> 04:04.360]  like I sent you the photo and we agreed we're going to do this.
[04:04.420 --> 04:05.380]  I'm very impatient.
[04:05.700 --> 04:08.720]  And I opened, I said, do you want the left box or the right box?
[04:08.900 --> 04:11.060]  And you said you didn't reply for a while.
[04:11.260 --> 04:13.600]  And so I just immediately opened the left box
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.560]  and then had tremendous guilt when I found the f*** face card in the box
[04:18.560 --> 04:21.160]  and prayed there was one in the right box.
[04:21.160 --> 04:23.840]  Because I wanted the card because it's a dumb, goofy card.
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.020]  But if I would have pulled that that moment from you
[04:27.020 --> 04:29.600]  because of my impatience, I would have felt so bad.
[04:29.840 --> 04:32.420]  Well, thank you, Andrew. That's very sweet of you.
[04:32.480 --> 04:34.760]  I'm looking at the Bill Ripken f*** face card right now.
[04:35.300 --> 04:38.280]  Anyway, the story behind that for years and years and years
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.680]  has been that Billy Ripken was a young player at the time
[04:42.680 --> 04:45.440]  and he was on the same team as his older brother,
[04:45.440 --> 04:48.540]  who was much more famous and successful as a baseball player than him.
[04:48.540 --> 04:51.860]  And Billy got a lot of good natured ribbing because of that.
[04:52.060 --> 04:54.780]  And the story that Billy propagated was that
[04:54.780 --> 04:56.900]  somebody played a prank on him and wrote f*** face on the bat
[04:56.900 --> 04:57.900]  and he had no clue.
[04:58.100 --> 04:59.920]  But the other night during my bout of insomnia,
[05:00.100 --> 05:02.320]  I was reading about it and I found out,
[05:02.660 --> 05:04.720]  and this will be particularly interesting to you, I think, Andrew.
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.280]  Bill Ripken admitted some 20 years later that he wrote f*** face on the bat.
[05:10.540 --> 05:11.920]  He f*** faced himself.
[05:12.160 --> 05:12.720]  That's incredible.
[05:12.980 --> 05:16.700]  So like the pseudo inspiration for the name of this podcast
[05:16.700 --> 05:20.860]  and the fact that we use it as a noun to describe a thing that we do,
[05:21.100 --> 05:26.000]  he actually did unintentionally in the creating of the card.
[05:26.240 --> 05:28.480]  He was saying that it was a practice bat
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.680]  and he liked to use a certain woodgrain practice bat
[05:31.680 --> 05:33.200]  and there were only a few of them
[05:33.200 --> 05:35.260]  and they would get, after batting practice,
[05:35.340 --> 05:38.300]  they get thrown into a big barrel full of bats
[05:38.300 --> 05:39.700]  and it's hard to find the one that you want.
[05:40.080 --> 05:42.520]  And so he wanted to write something on the bottom of the bat
[05:42.520 --> 05:45.500]  to make it noticeable really easily
[05:45.500 --> 05:47.720]  instead of just writing like BR or whatever.
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.160]  So he wrote f*** face as a joke
[05:50.780 --> 05:52.680]  so that he would always know it was his practice bat.
[05:52.920 --> 05:55.200]  And then he just forgot about it and took the photo.
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.800]  Didn't even cross his mind that it was the f*** face bat.
[05:58.040 --> 06:00.540]  Then when the picture came out and it became this controversy,
[06:00.980 --> 06:02.540]  he got scared essentially
[06:02.540 --> 06:04.920]  and pretended that somebody had played a prank on him,
[06:05.080 --> 06:06.760]  which everybody would believe.
[06:07.200 --> 06:12.060]  So the inception of f*** facing was tied to this card,
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.100]  at least in my mind,
[06:13.100 --> 06:16.440]  which I found out later Billy Ripken f*** faced himself.
[06:16.660 --> 06:20.360]  So that was an awesome late night discovery
[06:20.360 --> 06:21.600]  that I wanted to share with you guys.
[06:21.700 --> 06:25.160]  And you said that he waited 20 years to come clean?
[06:25.720 --> 06:28.920]  Yeah, well, the interview I read where he admitted to it
[06:28.920 --> 06:31.080]  was like 20 something years after.
[06:31.400 --> 06:33.620]  I bet the day after it came out, he was like,
[06:33.700 --> 06:36.380]  I should really give this four or five presidential terms
[06:36.380 --> 06:37.300]  before I admit this.
[06:38.800 --> 06:40.220]  How many trellises is that?
[06:40.480 --> 06:42.380]  That's like eight trellises if Jack's making them.
[06:42.380 --> 06:43.340]  20 years.
[06:46.080 --> 06:48.020]  If we ever get lucky enough,
[06:48.100 --> 06:51.960]  maybe we can have the OG f*** face Billy Ripken on our show someday,
[06:52.080 --> 06:53.000]  but I doubt it.
[06:53.300 --> 06:56.420]  I don't know if we'll ever rise to Billy Ripken f*** face fame.
[06:56.520 --> 06:59.220]  It probably depends whether or not he's trademarked f*** face.
[07:02.020 --> 07:03.920]  Could you imagine if that was a prank though?
[07:04.020 --> 07:05.520]  If somebody pulled that off on the team,
[07:05.620 --> 07:07.240]  how f***ing excited they would be?
[07:07.520 --> 07:09.960]  That'd have to be one of the greatest all-time sports prank,
[07:10.020 --> 07:10.840]  maybe any prank ever.
[07:10.840 --> 07:13.360]  Well, and the fact that the f*** face isn't upside down,
[07:13.460 --> 07:14.940]  it's right side up on the bat too,
[07:15.020 --> 07:16.440]  like it couldn't be framed better.
[07:16.560 --> 07:17.100]  It's perfect.
[07:17.280 --> 07:18.120]  The whole thing was tremendous.
[07:18.240 --> 07:20.660]  It was probably, uh, I mean, listen,
[07:20.760 --> 07:23.380]  it's a big f***ing deal to make it into Major League Baseball.
[07:23.440 --> 07:25.660]  They say it's harder to break into the MLB
[07:25.660 --> 07:28.700]  than it is to break into the pros in any other sport.
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.980]  And I'm sure a lot of non-Americans would dispute that,
[07:31.020 --> 07:31.780]  and you might be correct.
[07:32.040 --> 07:34.840]  I'm just saying what I've, what's been thrown around my entire life
[07:34.840 --> 07:38.940]  is that the hardest professional sport to get playing time in is baseball.
[07:39.360 --> 07:42.260]  So Billy, living under his brother's shadow,
[07:43.020 --> 07:45.240]  I gotta be honest, I think probably the highlight of his career
[07:45.240 --> 07:48.740]  might be a 1989 baseball card that says f*** face.
[07:48.800 --> 07:51.360]  That might be the most notable thing he did in his professional career,
[07:51.840 --> 07:53.720]  which, you know, although he was a hell of a player
[07:53.720 --> 07:55.280]  to even get to the Major Leagues,
[07:55.400 --> 07:57.440]  he wasn't a standout star like his brother.
[07:57.820 --> 07:59.920]  I mean, even if he was an all-time great player,
[08:00.500 --> 08:02.560]  I feel like the f*** face card is so iconic.
[08:02.680 --> 08:03.280]  That would be the top.
[08:03.560 --> 08:05.500]  It's almost better that he wasn't an all-time great
[08:05.500 --> 08:07.740]  because that'd suck if that's what you're known for
[08:07.740 --> 08:09.080]  and you had a Hall of Fame career.
[08:09.180 --> 08:09.720]  Oh, right.
[08:09.840 --> 08:11.320]  You think you could just never surpass.
[08:11.620 --> 08:13.660]  You're Ken Griffey Jr. and f*** face.
[08:13.840 --> 08:16.220]  Yeah, that would be tough.
[08:16.420 --> 08:16.920]  That would be tough.
[08:17.380 --> 08:19.000]  As far as the other thing, Gavin,
[08:19.460 --> 08:24.000]  I'm sorry that I've been playing or opening baseball and basketball cards with Andrew
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.760]  and we didn't include you.
[08:25.860 --> 08:27.900]  You know, it's fine. I've aged out. I get it.
[08:27.980 --> 08:30.140]  No, you've aged out. You're in your 30s now.
[08:30.580 --> 08:32.560]  You're no longer young enough for me, for my friendship.
[08:34.500 --> 08:37.120]  I would also like to point out that when I turned 40,
[08:37.120 --> 08:40.760]  Gavin told me he was going to stop being my friend until he turned 30.
[08:41.120 --> 08:42.700]  I mean, that was like a blanket rule for anyone.
[08:42.760 --> 08:43.820]  I think I said the same to Bernie.
[08:44.080 --> 08:46.840]  Yeah, and so there was a couple years there where you just told me we weren't friends.
[08:46.980 --> 08:47.440]  Yeah, bye.
[08:51.080 --> 08:54.100]  If my age starts with a 2 and yours starts with a 4, there's a problem.
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.080]  Sorry. Sorry, Andrew.
[08:57.520 --> 08:58.400]  F*** you, Gavin.
[09:01.320 --> 09:02.140]  Aye yai yai.

[10:28.000 --> 10:30.900]  But Gavin, I have shared things with you as well.
[10:30.900 --> 10:36.140]  Recently I started doing something that I'm quite horrified and proud of at the same time
[10:36.140 --> 10:41.020]  in that I've been, well, I've been losing my mind in quarantine.
[10:41.700 --> 10:41.920]  Sure.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.460]  As we all have.
[10:44.400 --> 10:49.360]  And so I'm left alone for the most of the day with just me and my recording equipment
[10:49.360 --> 10:51.200]  and a couple of lazy dogs.
[10:52.440 --> 10:55.140]  So I've been recording my farts.
[10:57.060 --> 10:57.540]  And...
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.020]  So I got a text the other day.
[11:02.500 --> 11:05.300]  It didn't have any sort of body to the text.
[11:05.420 --> 11:08.840]  It just said the file name from a voice memo.
[11:09.220 --> 11:10.160]  What was the file name?
[11:10.340 --> 11:11.520]  New recording 20.
[11:12.880 --> 11:17.640]  Which I hope 1 through 19 are actual serious voice memos and not just farts, but sure.
[11:17.640 --> 11:18.220]  They're not.
[11:19.700 --> 11:20.560]  So I got it.
[11:20.620 --> 11:21.400]  I played it.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.660]  Shall I play it now?
[11:22.980 --> 11:23.880]  If you want to, sure.
[11:26.200 --> 11:26.720]  Just...
[11:28.540 --> 11:32.620]  So I just replied, this is the beginning of something terrible.
[11:32.880 --> 11:33.680]  Yeah, it is.
[11:34.020 --> 11:37.680]  So I don't know, man, I was just bored.
[11:38.020 --> 11:41.520]  So I've been voice note recording on my iPhone, all of my farts.
[11:41.680 --> 11:47.740]  And what I've learned is that my farts are like fingerprints and snowflakes.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.900]  They're unique and individual and no two farts are the same, at least audibly.
[11:53.460 --> 11:58.720]  So I've become kind of fascinated with like the variance in my farts.
[11:58.920 --> 12:01.940]  And so I've started to think like, well, this is sort of a...
[12:01.940 --> 12:03.340]  This part kind of reminds me of Gavin.
[12:03.980 --> 12:07.540]  So what I've been doing is sending farts to the people in my life,
[12:08.300 --> 12:12.400]  unannounced and unrequested, and then just seeing what happens.
[12:12.840 --> 12:16.840]  It would be interesting on a larger sample, once you've done this several times.
[12:16.840 --> 12:19.620]  And I have like 50 farts sent to me and other people also have 50.
[12:19.620 --> 12:23.640]  It'd be fun to compare the different types and eventually see if you can
[12:24.020 --> 12:27.340]  filter them into the different buckets without, you know, without you being there.
[12:27.780 --> 12:30.820]  I'll say, man, this has been... I think it's a fantastic idea.
[12:31.060 --> 12:34.080]  And this has been really illuminating for a couple of reasons.
[12:34.280 --> 12:36.060]  One, I'm learning a lot about my own body.
[12:37.280 --> 12:39.820]  It's never too late. It's never too late, boys and girls, to learn about yourself.
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.380]  But also, it's amazing how upset people get, A, when they receive a fart.
[12:46.060 --> 12:47.700]  My mother was not jazzed.
[12:47.700 --> 12:52.180]  Ah, she was the first person I sent a fart to.
[12:53.080 --> 12:59.320]  I feel like a lot of your just living and existing is to annoy your mother
[13:00.020 --> 13:02.880]  in ways that are so targeted towards her.
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.000]  Like, I feel like you made your old aim names kind of just for her.
[13:07.540 --> 13:08.660]  Yes, yes.
[13:09.780 --> 13:12.420]  I used to... we'll get up on a tangent.
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.980]  I used to, for AOL Instant Messenger, that's how Rooster Teeth ran for
[13:18.160 --> 13:19.280]  many years there.
[13:19.820 --> 13:21.580]  That's how we communicated before Slack.
[13:22.140 --> 13:24.660]  And our aim names would always leak out.
[13:24.760 --> 13:27.820]  And then you just start getting aim names, like 100 aims a day from strangers.
[13:28.020 --> 13:32.280]  And so I'd have to constantly change them to things that I didn't think anyone would guess
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.640]  or have any interest in aiming.
[13:35.900 --> 13:40.980]  And so for the longest time, my aim name was Set Sail for Ass.
[13:42.260 --> 13:45.540]  And my mom wanted to start aiming with me, and she was offended by the name.
[13:45.600 --> 13:46.960]  So she made me change... she asked me to change it.
[13:46.960 --> 13:48.600]  So I changed it to Delicious Boner.
[13:49.480 --> 13:53.200]  And then made my mom talk to me with that aim name.
[13:53.500 --> 13:55.760]  Wasn't there also, like, My Balls Your Ass as well?
[13:55.760 --> 13:57.700]  My Balls Your Ass was one of them.
[13:58.180 --> 14:01.760]  She would only talk to me through the one, because, I don't know, they're...
[14:02.260 --> 14:04.040]  different levels of offensive to her, I guess.
[14:04.260 --> 14:08.140]  I distinctly remember getting my first Delicious Boner message.
[14:08.320 --> 14:11.820]  Because I had no concept that you're going to message me.
[14:11.960 --> 14:13.380]  I think we had talked, like, twice.
[14:13.380 --> 14:17.200]  And I was watching a movie with my mom on my laptop.
[14:17.580 --> 14:21.680]  And then top right corner, just randomly, Delicious Boner says sup.
[14:22.020 --> 14:23.960]  And I had to, like, pause the movie.
[14:24.180 --> 14:25.260]  Because I didn't know what it was.
[14:25.380 --> 14:26.660]  I was like, this doesn't look good.
[14:26.680 --> 14:27.540]  I don't know what this is.
[14:27.800 --> 14:28.960]  I have no involvement with this.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.540]  I can imagine you just looking over at her and looking back at your laptop,
[14:32.720 --> 14:33.880]  closing it and walking away.
[14:33.980 --> 14:35.460]  It was a very awkward moment.
[14:35.620 --> 14:36.560]  I had to pause the film.
[14:36.580 --> 14:38.960]  And then I realized it was Geoff, and it was fine.
[14:39.040 --> 14:41.160]  But it was just, who is Delicious Boner?
[14:41.340 --> 14:42.600]  Why is this happening right now?
[14:42.600 --> 14:44.220]  So, the farts.
[14:44.520 --> 14:47.120]  When you send a fart, what do you want in return?
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.480]  Do you want, like, a comment or a little review of the fart?
[14:49.600 --> 14:51.140]  Or do you want it to be ignored?
[14:51.460 --> 14:52.280]  I don't give a shit.
[14:52.680 --> 14:55.200]  The reaction that you're going to give me back,
[14:55.540 --> 14:59.260]  it will never match the reaction that I've invented in my head.
[14:59.940 --> 15:04.960]  Like, I sent you that fart in my head three or four times before I sent it in real life
[15:04.960 --> 15:06.820]  to prepare and to kind of...
[15:06.820 --> 15:12.080]  I like to craft my own responses to these things, especially when I can't see you.
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.380]  So then, I'll just assume that that was the response I got, and I'll be very happy.
[15:18.100 --> 15:20.140]  So yeah, you were horrified in my brain.
[15:21.300 --> 15:24.300]  And you threw up a little in your mouth when you realized what it was,
[15:24.480 --> 15:25.880]  which made me very happy.
[15:26.380 --> 15:28.140]  But the thing that's been crazy to me is, yeah,
[15:28.260 --> 15:30.600]  people are offended or grossed out or weirded out.
[15:30.800 --> 15:33.340]  But people are more upset not to get farted.
[15:33.540 --> 15:33.940]  Interesting.
[15:34.300 --> 15:36.500]  People at Rooster Teeth, at our company that we work for,
[15:36.660 --> 15:40.540]  when they find out I've sent farts to some people and not others, they get really mad.
[15:40.540 --> 15:42.020]  Like, genuinely offended.
[15:42.200 --> 15:43.780]  Like, why didn't I make the fart list?
[15:44.020 --> 15:46.960]  Do you not like me enough to send me a personal fart?
[15:47.100 --> 15:49.260]  How exclusive is this list currently?
[15:49.500 --> 15:53.600]  I have sent farts to you, my mom, and Trevor currently.
[15:56.120 --> 15:58.020]  And I'll be... Andrew's on the list.
[15:58.100 --> 15:59.020]  I'll be sending more.
[15:59.420 --> 16:01.680]  But A, I don't want to shoot my wad all at once.
[16:01.860 --> 16:04.560]  I want to drag this out for as long as humanly possible.
[16:05.080 --> 16:05.820]  And then B...
[16:05.820 --> 16:06.380]  I'd like to...
[16:06.380 --> 16:07.460]  Sorry, just to cut you off for a minute.
[16:07.620 --> 16:09.820]  I like... you opened this up with, I was bored.
[16:09.820 --> 16:12.920]  Now you have, like, a plan, like, there's over 25...
[16:12.920 --> 16:14.360]  You can't... this is... you have a problem.
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.160]  This isn't an I was bored moment.
[16:16.460 --> 16:18.000]  This has gone way beyond I was bored.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.140]  Yeah, do you have, like, a spreadsheet going for...
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.240]  Not yet. Not yet.
[16:21.400 --> 16:23.620]  I haven't... I've considered it, yeah.
[16:24.180 --> 16:25.640]  How else are you going to categorize this stuff?
[16:26.380 --> 16:31.260]  I will say, Andrew, it's that level of tenacity that helped create Rooster Teeth,
[16:31.320 --> 16:32.860]  and why we're all here, I'd like to think.
[16:33.060 --> 16:37.820]  I'd like to think that with my boredom, I create and categorize and...
[16:38.780 --> 16:41.740]  all of my farts, and then figure out who those farts apply to.
[16:41.900 --> 16:45.080]  See, that's the grand scheme of things, is I'm not going to send you a fart,
[16:45.280 --> 16:47.820]  unless that fart, to me, says you.
[16:48.320 --> 16:51.760]  Like, the fart that Gavin played, that's Gavin in a fart.
[16:53.140 --> 16:56.320]  100%. The fart that I said to my mom was my mom in a fart.
[16:56.540 --> 16:59.720]  Let me try and sort of find some adjectives to describe...
[16:59.720 --> 17:00.860]  I'm gonna have to listen to this one more time.
[17:02.720 --> 17:04.960]  So it's definitely sort of up and down.
[17:05.520 --> 17:05.940]  It's, um...
[17:06.560 --> 17:07.040]  It's two ways.
[17:07.040 --> 17:09.540]  I would say you pushed in the middle.
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.240]  There was a build-up on either side, and a little bit wet.
[17:13.560 --> 17:14.660]  I don't know what that says about me, though.
[17:15.160 --> 17:17.560]  Here's the deal. It's irreverent. It's silly.
[17:17.960 --> 17:20.040]  The fart doesn't take itself too seriously.
[17:20.960 --> 17:24.140]  And the fart presents itself and then says,
[17:24.460 --> 17:26.260]  no, no, there's more to me than that.
[17:26.360 --> 17:28.460]  And then comes back with a second wave of fart.
[17:28.700 --> 17:31.880]  And that's the thing that I love about you, Gav, is there's always more to the story.
[17:32.600 --> 17:33.480]  There's never...
[17:34.460 --> 17:39.400]  The Gavin Free fart personality, it never ends.
[17:39.500 --> 17:40.640]  There's always more to you.
[17:40.980 --> 17:47.120]  I would like to craft a better fart, and maybe as I continue down this road,
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.100]  I'll get to a point where I find one that even more encapsulates you and your personality.
[17:52.740 --> 17:56.660]  Because believe me, if I could have made that fart longer with more surprises, I would have.
[17:56.780 --> 17:59.980]  I feel like over time, it's like one of those police sketch artists
[17:59.980 --> 18:03.100]  where you're describing someone, but you're using different farts.
[18:03.340 --> 18:08.620]  And as I get more farts, it'll become more clear what my personality is through these farts.
[18:09.100 --> 18:11.820]  I think there's also, there's some future to this.
[18:11.900 --> 18:15.320]  I feel like if you've recorded all your farts for, say, a year,
[18:16.040 --> 18:22.260]  you could potentially find the best fart sound, like the best, most satisfying, audible fart.
[18:22.580 --> 18:28.400]  And I feel like we could potentially take that waveform and print it on a shirt.
[18:28.400 --> 18:31.200]  Or Andrew will get it tattooed across his forehead or something.
[18:31.400 --> 18:34.640]  There'll be the fart in visual format.
[18:34.880 --> 18:38.120]  Maybe that's the culmination of last week's episode,
[18:38.320 --> 18:44.200]  which is we want to do some sort of a GoFundMe or find a top-line sponsor to tattoo Andrew's face.
[18:44.620 --> 18:47.300]  Maybe the tattoo is the waveform of the perfect fart.
[18:47.780 --> 18:48.440]  I think that's perfect.
[18:49.020 --> 18:49.880]  That's a brilliant idea, Gavin.
[18:50.220 --> 18:53.560]  Andrew, no need to respond. I'm going to assume you're on board for this.
[18:54.180 --> 18:58.220]  I mean, I think the part you're missing is there's a million dollar exchange.
[18:58.220 --> 19:00.660]  I wasn't just looking to put fucking Tide on my forehead.
[19:00.920 --> 19:02.600]  This is a million dollar deal.
[19:02.840 --> 19:06.600]  We got step one. We got profit. We just need step two. We'll get there.
[19:07.680 --> 19:09.900]  How many variations of farts do you have?
[19:10.420 --> 19:11.640]  Not as many as I want.
[19:12.180 --> 19:15.940]  Yeah, I feel like I got like a fastball and like, I don't know, a changeup.
[19:16.080 --> 19:17.760]  There's not a lot of variation in my fart.
[19:17.980 --> 19:23.920]  I'm working on it. I have... the difficulty with me is there's a bit of performance anxiety
[19:24.580 --> 19:26.000]  when I know a fart is coming.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.260]  I got to get my phone together. I got to get in the right position.
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.000]  It gets very stressful. I get a little... it gets a little hectic.
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.940]  And sometimes the fart that I push out isn't the fart that I had... I guess that I'd imagined.
[19:37.460 --> 19:39.080]  That wasn't the one that was in the chamber?
[19:39.640 --> 19:41.360]  No. Yeah. So that's been a real problem.
[19:41.760 --> 19:45.880]  And I have... I'll be honest, a lot of my better farts have just slipped out
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.700]  walking through the hall or whatever when my phone wasn't around.
[19:48.700 --> 19:57.120]  I've left... unfortunately, I've left quite a few A-plus, triple star rated,
[19:59.060 --> 20:03.600]  just absolute honkers on the cutting room floor because I couldn't get my phone out fast enough
[20:03.600 --> 20:10.140]  or I recorded it poorly or whatever. Yeah. It's a... I haven't perfected the process yet,
[20:10.180 --> 20:10.840]  but I'm working on it.
[20:11.040 --> 20:14.480]  Have you accepted that you're going to eventually record yourself shitting yourself?
[20:14.660 --> 20:15.520]  I hope so. Yeah.
[20:15.640 --> 20:16.640]  It's a dangerous game you're playing.
[20:16.640 --> 20:20.020]  Yeah. That's a Michael Jones. I'm going to send that... when I shit myself,
[20:20.120 --> 20:20.940]  I'm going to send that to Michael.
[20:21.120 --> 20:26.060]  That's definitely a Michael in it. I feel like that will be a different sounding fart.
[20:26.140 --> 20:30.480]  Like if you gave me 99 farts and one of them was a follow through,
[20:30.720 --> 20:32.380]  I bet I could point out which one that was.
[20:33.720 --> 20:35.560]  I bet you could too. Well, Gavin, you've...
[20:36.900 --> 20:40.140]  If you follow our other podcasts, you'll know that Gavin and I, at least,
[20:40.180 --> 20:44.100]  I can't speak to you, Andrew, but Gavin and I have shit our pants a lot around each other.
[20:44.240 --> 20:44.600]  Oh boy.
[20:44.600 --> 20:50.480]  And so you probably are more intimately familiar with that side of me than anybody else on earth,
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.960]  except maybe my mom. But for her, it's been a while.
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.980]  There were times like, okay, so when we lived together, we always had different rooms,
[20:59.220 --> 21:03.080]  occasionally a different building that we slept in. And whenever you would just,
[21:03.500 --> 21:07.220]  without warning, barge into my room, I knew something had happened.
[21:07.500 --> 21:10.980]  Like you wouldn't ever just come in and say hi. You would always come in being like,
[21:10.980 --> 21:16.040]  hey, I bought you a tiny motorbike and you would just leave it in the room. Or you would come in
[21:16.040 --> 21:22.160]  with your boxes off and a load of towels and say, I just shit the couch.
[21:24.120 --> 21:31.760]  Yeah, that's true. I was drinking back then. That was before I sobered up. So yeah, I was...
[21:32.360 --> 21:34.600]  How many times did you guys say you shit yourself?
[21:34.600 --> 21:40.000]  Oh, oh God. I think I shit myself probably back in those days,
[21:40.580 --> 21:42.380]  probably four or five times a year.
[21:42.440 --> 21:43.840]  Yeah, that's a quarterly shit for you.
[21:43.980 --> 21:46.080]  Yeah, I was probably one a year.
[21:46.380 --> 21:50.220]  Andrew, have you ever heard the story about how Gavin shit himself seven times in one day?
[21:50.340 --> 21:51.900]  That really messed up my average, to be honest.
[21:52.240 --> 21:52.640]  Seven times?
[21:53.120 --> 21:54.000]  In one day.
[21:54.400 --> 21:54.720]  How?
[21:54.760 --> 21:58.580]  In one day. Oh, not only did Gavin... Sorry, I'm not gonna tell your story for you, Gavin. But
[21:58.580 --> 22:04.620]  not only did Gavin shit himself seven times, almost each shit was unique and embarrassing
[22:04.620 --> 22:09.800]  in its own way. Like he shit himself really impressively in a lot of impressive environments.
[22:10.160 --> 22:13.920]  You know, like when you're doing science and you want to change one variable each time
[22:13.920 --> 22:17.800]  and sort of measure the results, each shit had a different factor.
[22:18.280 --> 22:21.440]  Do you want to run down the highlights of some of the places you shit yourself that day?
[22:21.580 --> 22:24.360]  Yeah, I shit myself at a restaurant. That was the first one.
[22:24.620 --> 22:24.740]  Yeah.
[22:24.740 --> 22:29.920]  Threw away my underwear. The next shit was on a plane because I'd fallen asleep
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.960]  and the muscles sort of clenching my anus closed had relaxed, so some poo came out.
[22:35.580 --> 22:40.760]  I shit the shower. I shit the bed. I think two were in the bed, to be honest.
[22:41.100 --> 22:41.320]  Two?
[22:41.400 --> 22:43.660]  I just stopped changing my underwear eventually. I was like,
[22:43.680 --> 22:45.200]  I'm just gonna shit my ass cheeks at this point.
[22:45.360 --> 22:49.740]  How? But how did, like, you just, like, did this surprise you every time?
[22:50.180 --> 22:51.520]  I don't understand how this happens.
[22:51.520 --> 22:57.420]  Honestly, it was, it was food poisoning. And it was unlike any experience I've ever had where
[22:57.420 --> 23:03.680]  if I wasn't actively holding my ass closed, just shitty liquid would leak out.
[23:04.100 --> 23:09.300]  And, you know, after like 45 minutes of clenching it all in, eventually,
[23:09.620 --> 23:13.360]  just naturally, you stop thinking about it and you relax or you think about something else.
[23:13.500 --> 23:16.880]  And then you just, it seeps out. And when you're asleep, it's impossible.
[23:17.160 --> 23:18.800]  I respect your commitment to the bed.
[23:19.240 --> 23:19.660]  Dude.
[23:19.660 --> 23:22.900]  Like, after you shit yourself four times, you then go to the bed,
[23:23.220 --> 23:26.120]  shit yourself in the bed and then decide to go back to the bed.
[23:26.860 --> 23:27.280]  That's commitment.
[23:27.500 --> 23:31.180]  I pulled the sheets off, but it did get to the point where I just stopped putting new boxes on.
[23:31.380 --> 23:32.900]  So it's like, this is just gonna keep going.
[23:33.340 --> 23:38.140]  Wasn't this also during the courting phase between you and Meg and you were visiting her?
[23:38.820 --> 23:41.100]  Yeah, I think it was our second date.
[23:42.520 --> 23:42.940]  Perfect.
[23:45.160 --> 23:47.920]  That was what it took to seal the deal, huh?
[23:48.840 --> 23:52.440]  You were... Women love, in my experience, women love vulnerability.
[23:53.240 --> 23:56.060]  They like to see a man who's comfortable being vulnerable.
[23:56.280 --> 23:59.600]  I mean, when I saw her reaction to it, I knew she was the one.
[23:59.960 --> 24:00.180]  Yeah.
[24:00.320 --> 24:02.560]  She just found it very funny and drove me home.
[24:03.060 --> 24:08.580]  I can't even take credit for sending the farts out. When I was just sitting on the sofa with
[24:08.580 --> 24:12.400]  my ass in the air as if I, like, as if I were trying, you know the position, it's like when
[24:12.400 --> 24:16.060]  Trevor, who also works with the Rooster Teeth, when he tries to blow himself.
[24:16.440 --> 24:19.960]  It was essentially that position and I was recording a fart and my girlfriend Emily
[24:19.960 --> 24:23.400]  walked in and she goes, what are you doing? And I go, oh, I'm just recording my farts.
[24:23.760 --> 24:26.440]  And she didn't skip a beat. She goes, you send one to your mom.
[24:27.700 --> 24:31.880]  Send it to your mom. And that's what kicked all this off. I was like, I should send it to my mom.
[24:32.340 --> 24:35.240]  That is a great idea. And then it's like, well, if I'm going to send it to my mom,
[24:35.340 --> 24:39.040]  I got to send it to my friends and my work family as well.
[24:39.180 --> 24:41.960]  So it's like, you know, when you find the right one, you know.
[24:42.180 --> 24:43.660]  Has she started doing hers?
[24:43.660 --> 24:49.080]  No, she doesn't. There's a game we play in our family here that is,
[24:49.360 --> 24:55.580]  it's impossible that we've been dating for over two years. And to my knowledge,
[24:55.620 --> 25:02.160]  my girlfriend has never gone number two or farted. And it's, she insists that she doesn't do it.
[25:02.320 --> 25:05.900]  I'm not kidding when I say, I think that she goes to like a Staples or well,
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.340]  pre-court, like a Staples or an Office Max in route to take care of business.
[25:11.340 --> 25:14.880]  Because now we live together and we live together in quarantine.
[25:15.160 --> 25:17.820]  And unless she's like getting up at 4.30 in the morning
[25:18.820 --> 25:23.440]  and then going to the other side of the house to shit in the other bathroom, she's not doing it.
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.120]  She's never farted and never pooped. And I'm desperate to catch her in the act.
[25:29.320 --> 25:31.860]  How's it so one-sided though? Because usually I feel like, you know,
[25:31.940 --> 25:35.660]  once one person's comfortable farting, the other person lets their guard down too.
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.720]  And before, you know, everyone's fine, but she has still never done it in front of you?
[25:39.720 --> 25:44.300]  Never, never once. She's a burper. Ah, that's her. That's where she lets loose.
[25:44.540 --> 25:48.760]  She even told me, she's like, you'll never experience one of my farts in your life.
[25:48.900 --> 25:54.940]  Never. And maybe if I put a ring on her, I can, I can then witness that.
[25:55.220 --> 25:59.240]  But, but yeah, she said like burping is where I'm going to just let it go.
[25:59.480 --> 26:01.340]  And she's a, she's a massive burper.
[26:01.620 --> 26:04.300]  I'm just imagining you walking around your house with like a boom mic,
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.100]  trying to catch Sasquatch, like this fart, like you're trying to capture the rarest creature.
[26:09.100 --> 26:12.000]  I hide in her closet when she goes to the bathroom.
[26:12.320 --> 26:16.560]  And then when she comes out, I jump at her to try to scare her to like scare a fart out.
[26:17.940 --> 26:20.700]  And I've scared the utter shit out of her, but I've never,
[26:20.780 --> 26:23.220]  I never scared the literal shit out of her, unfortunately.
[26:23.660 --> 26:27.680]  I can just imagine you popping out of a laundry basket or something with headphones and like a
[26:27.680 --> 26:30.300]  dish on a stick, like pick it up sound waves.
[26:30.680 --> 26:31.980]  Yeah. It's like, what are you doing?
[26:32.480 --> 26:36.100]  Something similar to that. Yeah. We've gotten, we've gotten pretty,
[26:36.480 --> 26:39.580]  uh, pretty ridiculous with that. She, she likes to scare the shit out of me.
[26:39.740 --> 26:42.620]  Uh, I like to scare her. We get real pranky.
[26:42.920 --> 26:45.300]  We've had to kind of put a moratorium on it because things are getting out of control
[26:45.660 --> 26:47.020]  towards the beginning of the quarantine.
[26:47.440 --> 26:49.380]  I gotta say, I'm impressed with your fart conversation.
[26:49.720 --> 26:52.560]  I thought you were, I didn't know what you're doing. It's a real art.
[26:52.700 --> 26:56.100]  You've sold me on that. This is an artistic endeavor that you're pursuing.
[26:56.980 --> 27:01.800]  Well, thank you, Andrew. Uh, I'm happy to be able to bring you into the,
[27:02.200 --> 27:08.740]  into the conversation finally. Uh, and, uh, I hope, I hope that I'll find the appropriate and
[27:08.740 --> 27:12.400]  perfect pant and fart and, uh, I'll be able to share that with you soon.
[27:12.600 --> 27:14.860]  I don't know if I need it, but I'm happy that you're doing this.
[27:15.020 --> 27:16.700]  Are you a good farter, Andrew?
[27:17.320 --> 27:20.840]  As I, I think I'm a pretty boring farter. I don't think, uh,
[27:20.840 --> 27:21.440]  Very consistent.
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.400]  Yeah. Very average. Like I maybe have two variations, I'd assume.
[27:25.600 --> 27:27.180]  Yeah. What'd you say? You got a fastball and a change up?
[27:27.220 --> 27:29.660]  Yeah. I think I got like a fastball and change up, but that's about it.
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.920]  Uh, not a lot. I mean, I think I could probably, if you put candles on a cake,
[27:33.980 --> 27:37.480]  I think I could take two candles out. I think that's the max of my range.
[27:38.780 --> 27:42.420]  Like that's where I thought, I thought you're going to like a combine of farting. I thought
[27:42.420 --> 27:47.700]  you're really getting into an ass game. Um, I didn't expect it to go art, but yeah,
[27:47.740 --> 27:50.840]  I think I could probably take out like two candles, but that's, that's my peak.
[27:51.040 --> 27:54.580]  Oh, I don't think I could do one. Mine are pretty weak, to be honest. They all sort of,
[27:54.580 --> 27:57.180]  they trail up at the end. They all sound like questions.
[28:04.060 --> 28:11.260]  They're very ponderous farts. Oh God. I did not think we were going to go 20. Oh,
[28:11.300 --> 28:13.760]  I don't know, 30 minutes or so talking about farts today.
[28:14.940 --> 28:19.120]  Should we get onto a face? Yeah. That would caught me off guard. Uh,
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.680]  yeah. Well, Andrew, you had mentioned you referred to yourself as Canada's greatest gamer.
[28:24.020 --> 28:28.880]  Very well-earned. I'm not saying I'm not refuting it in any way. I just wanted to make sure I got
[28:28.880 --> 28:34.940]  the phrase right. Why do you feel comfortable calling yourself Canada's greatest gamer?
[28:35.240 --> 28:40.580]  I think it's a factual statement when you own every Garfield cart world record on Xbox. I don't
[28:40.580 --> 28:44.480]  think like I need to sell it in any way. I think that kind of just explains all of it.
[28:44.620 --> 28:51.400]  What is Garfield cart? I'm assuming is, uh, it's a cart racer similar to Mario cart, right?
[28:51.460 --> 28:57.060]  It is, uh, yeah, it is. Some would say a lesser Mario cart. Some would say better. I don't know
[28:57.060 --> 29:01.580]  who those are, but, uh, it's, uh, like a, yeah, it's a Mario cart clan. And how did you become
[29:01.580 --> 29:07.640]  the Canada? How did you become the Mario, the fuck, what is it called? Garfield cart world tour?
[29:08.340 --> 29:13.180]  Uh, furious racing. Garfield cart furious racing. Garfield cart furious racing.
[29:13.500 --> 29:18.220]  They made two Geoffs. So it's clearly, it's a big deal. Why did you buy it?
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.920]  Uh, cause I really wanted to be good at a game that nobody was good at. And, uh,
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.460]  I went to the Xbox store and you know how they have like, what's the highest selling game?
[29:27.060 --> 29:32.060]  I clicked that. And then I went to the bottom of that and I saw what was the least selling game.
[29:32.660 --> 29:37.620]  And number seven was Garfield cart. And we, and we should let the listeners know that you are
[29:38.820 --> 29:44.700]  incredibly competitive. Like you, if it was one time where I had like one better time in,
[29:44.760 --> 29:50.320]  in a trials HD map than you, and you spent like weeks straight trying to beat it until you find
[29:50.320 --> 29:56.800]  a hundred days beating your every single morning, I would do seven runs of the course.
[29:56.820 --> 29:59.660]  And it took me a hundred on the hundredth day. I finally beat it.
[29:59.860 --> 30:04.620]  This was a track back in trials HD days, which is I assume the late two thousands
[30:05.240 --> 30:12.040]  when that came out. And, uh, I did this crazy run on a track where I almost fell off and it got to
[30:12.040 --> 30:16.420]  the point where I was like, I was at the absolute tipping point. And I just eked under this bit
[30:16.420 --> 30:19.400]  that's usually slows you down, but because I almost fell off, I didn't get slowed down.
[30:19.400 --> 30:23.740]  And I ended up at like 19th in the world or something on that track. So I was like,
[30:24.480 --> 30:29.140]  no one I know is beating that. And like a decade later you cut, you come in and beat my time.
[30:29.280 --> 30:33.780]  Yeah. I'm so delusional. I took that as a personal attack. I was talking to somebody
[30:34.300 --> 30:37.860]  completely unrelated to you. And we're arguing about who had a higher, like who was higher on
[30:37.860 --> 30:43.780]  the leaderboards. And so I downloaded it and you had all the top times on beginner and I was second.
[30:43.820 --> 30:47.820]  I was like, Oh, clearly he tried to beat my times at some point, that asshole. I'm going to get all
[30:47.820 --> 30:52.380]  my times back. And then I found out you just like had a game night with your friends. That's what
[30:52.380 --> 30:57.760]  you guys did. Had nothing to do with trying to beat times. Yeah, me and three friends just got
[30:57.760 --> 31:01.760]  together. We did something called trials Tuesday, where we all brought our Xboxes and TVs to the
[31:01.760 --> 31:06.520]  same room and just play trials. It happened. It happened one time. I played the best in my entire
[31:06.520 --> 31:13.420]  life. Also one of my, I brought, um, we all had our TVs and my TV remote was controlling one of
[31:13.420 --> 31:20.900]  my friend's TVs. I was messing with it the whole time. I kept turning his TV off when he was right
[31:20.900 --> 31:30.500]  near the end. Oh dear. Oh dear Lord. So, so that unhealthy level of competition and, uh, what's
[31:30.500 --> 31:37.300]  maybe the largest chip on a shoulder I've seen, uh, in my 44, almost 45 years, that led you to
[31:37.300 --> 31:44.060]  get hyper competitive in whatever the fuck that game is called. Garfield, furious racing. Yeah.
[31:44.300 --> 31:48.560]  It wasn't my first attempt. The first thing I have, uh, there's a Ben-Hur Xbox one game
[31:48.560 --> 31:52.940]  for some reason. Like they made that movie that nobody wanted, nobody saw, and they made a video
[31:52.940 --> 31:57.960]  game for it that was free and that has a leaderboard, but it's dead. Shockingly, they
[31:57.960 --> 32:03.980]  continued not to support Ben-Hur, the video game. So then I had to go to Garfield cart and, uh, let
[32:03.980 --> 32:09.100]  me say, it was a very competitive four hours to become the greatest Garfield cart player. What
[32:09.100 --> 32:15.160]  happened after you broke? Cause you texted me and you were like, I now have like the world record
[32:15.660 --> 32:21.840]  in every track on this stupid game. And then like 10 minutes later, you were like, I have an enemy.
[32:22.100 --> 32:26.200]  Yes. The problem is it started as a joke, but then when you're on top, you don't want to fall
[32:26.200 --> 32:31.920]  off that. So now I'm incredibly serious about my Garfield cart racing. Like as soon as I got all
[32:31.920 --> 32:36.500]  the time, someone else started taking times and I had a heated rivalry with someone that I'm pretty
[32:36.500 --> 32:41.840]  sure was seven. Well, this podcast is surely the death sentence of your top times. Like people
[32:41.840 --> 32:44.800]  are going to go out there. They're going to get the game. They're going to knock you off the,
[32:44.840 --> 32:48.580]  off the top of the pedestal. If this was back then, Gavin, I would have been nervous. I've
[32:48.580 --> 32:52.840]  gone through like eight rivals. Okay. I'm the top of lasagna mountain. I'm not even a little bit
[32:52.840 --> 32:58.300]  worried about it. The game costs like 30 bucks. So that's why I've been able to hold it partially
[32:58.300 --> 33:03.280]  because nobody's dumb enough to spend $30 on a Garfield game. I would welcome all challengers
[33:03.280 --> 33:07.160]  though. You can try. You can try. You're going to waste your time and money though.
[33:07.300 --> 33:09.720]  You're going to get dethroned before we film the next one.
[33:10.100 --> 33:14.800]  I'm going to retire by the time we film the next one. And that's going out on top.
[33:15.040 --> 33:19.400]  I think my favorite part of this saga was the, I don't know if he did the same to you,
[33:19.800 --> 33:27.120]  Gavin, but Andrew just kept sending me screenshots of DMs of him talking shit to little kids on
[33:27.120 --> 33:32.500]  Xbox live and getting into these heated rivalries using Garfield puns to insult people.
[33:33.700 --> 33:37.220]  It's a serious game. Do you have any of those exchanges to hand?
[33:37.420 --> 33:40.680]  It was, yeah. It's a lot of when you race against me every day is a Monday,
[33:41.020 --> 33:45.280]  stuff like that. And Garfield, lasagna mountain.
[33:48.660 --> 33:53.440]  It got heated. I've had four or five rivals. I just don't know where this stuff comes from.
[33:53.440 --> 33:59.680]  What made you, you're always doing the weirdest, most interesting stuff that I feel like no one
[33:59.680 --> 34:01.440]  could write. Agreed. Yeah.
[34:01.840 --> 34:05.340]  Well, what do you mean? What started it? What do you mean? Why am I shit talking?
[34:05.340 --> 34:08.180]  Just with everything that you do. No, just what made you want to do that?
[34:09.060 --> 34:12.620]  Well, I don't know. I just, I woke up. I always had a fascination with,
[34:13.500 --> 34:17.420]  there's got to be a Michael Jordan of basket weaving. And we just don't know who that is
[34:17.420 --> 34:21.620]  because nobody cares about basket weaving. I just find it interesting. People that are
[34:21.620 --> 34:26.600]  insanely talented at something, but also just nobody cares because nobody is aware of it.
[34:26.740 --> 34:30.740]  Real fast. I just like to say to the basket weaving community that may or may not be
[34:30.740 --> 34:36.920]  listening to this podcast, Andrew's views do not represent the views of myself or possibly Gavin
[34:36.920 --> 34:43.540]  Free. I have deep respect for basket weavers, a deep and profound respect for you. Please do not
[34:45.260 --> 34:48.900]  mobilize the basket weaving lobby against us.
[34:48.900 --> 34:54.600]  Do you think basket weavers also get into other stuff like wicker shoes and stuff? Is that the
[34:54.600 --> 35:00.580]  same field? Yeah. I think we're just speculating. I would imagine if you're a basket weaver,
[35:00.780 --> 35:08.520]  your house probably looks like a Pier 1 Imports, like factory store. It's just, everything is
[35:08.520 --> 35:15.460]  wicker and just, it just brittle old small pieces of wood. Every time you sit down, you get that
[35:16.020 --> 35:22.700]  wood crushing sound. But anyway, Andrew, please continue talking shit about basket weavers.
[35:23.060 --> 35:28.280]  I mean, nobody, I don't, I have nothing against basket weaving, but I feel like as a society,
[35:28.460 --> 35:33.660]  we've decided basket weaving isn't that important. Do you know anyone who basket weaves?
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.420]  I don't know a single basket weaver. I don't, but I'm afraid we're about to.
[35:39.560 --> 35:43.640]  As I said, I'm on top of Lasagna Mountain if they get there, if they dethrone me. Now,
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.720]  if a basket weaver dethrones me, that'd be a hell of a story. If any basket weavers out there.
[35:49.020 --> 35:54.600]  You're still defending your titles. Is anybody gunning for you right now at the moment?
[35:55.040 --> 35:59.240]  No, I had a really heated one right when the Jordan documentary was airing,
[35:59.320 --> 36:04.180]  and that was a real motivator. That was probably the closest I've had to losing a time. There's
[36:04.180 --> 36:08.980]  one time I don't have, and it was glitched. I've confirmed with the person, they can't set the
[36:08.980 --> 36:13.020]  time that it says they have. I don't know how it happened, but I'm number two on one, but I'm
[36:13.020 --> 36:16.700]  actually number one. It hurts me every time I see. I've reached out to the company.
[36:17.020 --> 36:20.300]  To make that official, I think you're gonna need to get them to sign something and have it
[36:20.300 --> 36:25.140]  notarized. Oh, I mean, I have a message from them admitting it. I made them switch what game they
[36:25.140 --> 36:31.080]  were playing to verify. Mail them a form, have them, you can e-donorize now. I learned about
[36:31.080 --> 36:40.280]  that from Gavin. And yeah, so that we can maintain that official status. Also, do you plan, how long
[36:40.280 --> 36:46.920]  do you plan on being the king of Lasagna Mountain? I guess until someone takes the throne, which I
[36:46.920 --> 36:52.720]  don't know, years? Maybe never. I think I'm gonna hold these records forever. Why would I think
[36:52.720 --> 37:00.860]  otherwise? Goddamn, Andrew. So how did you end up in the paper? Oh, that was, that's funny. Yeah,
[37:00.980 --> 37:05.400]  I don't know. That was one of those things where you wake up at 1am and I was thinking about like,
[37:05.400 --> 37:11.020]  I've had rivals, how do I escalate this further? Because the bigger it gets, the funnier it is
[37:11.020 --> 37:16.520]  because it's so stupid. And I thought, I bet you I could get the local paper to write about it.
[37:16.760 --> 37:23.160]  So I just sent out this email to, I submitted a story, a news scoop, and called myself that I was
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.880]  a professional gamer, which from Grifball, technically true. I was in the pro league
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.580]  in the Grifball league. Sure. All I had to do was click a box that said pro to make me a pro,
[37:33.580 --> 37:38.320]  but technically I was in the pro league. So I wrote up that email, I sent it to him,
[37:38.440 --> 37:43.180]  didn't really expect a reply. And the next day I got a response saying, I'd love to cover this.
[37:44.180 --> 37:49.700]  I need to do an interview. Let's push this further, which I did. Was it over the phone?
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.320]  No, it was an email interview. Oh, okay. Yeah, we did an email interview. And then it was a
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.040]  weird thing where like, I didn't tell members of my family, this isn't a paper that gets delivered
[37:59.040 --> 38:05.400]  to like every house where I live for free. And, uh, I didn't really tell anyone in my family.
[38:05.620 --> 38:10.580]  And then it became this kind of big deal with people that knew me. And then not, they think
[38:10.580 --> 38:14.560]  like I'm actually, they think this is an accomplishment. Like I'm the Garfield guy
[38:14.560 --> 38:20.620]  when it was a joke. And I didn't know how to break that to them. Like my grandparents think
[38:20.620 --> 38:25.760]  this is an amazing achievement. I have friends like, it's ridiculous. Then I started getting
[38:25.760 --> 38:30.300]  asked to do radio interviews for it. And that was fun. Are you serious? Did you do radio interviews
[38:30.300 --> 38:35.340]  about it? I didn't end up doing any of those, but I got a CBC, which is like the main network
[38:35.920 --> 38:41.020]  in Canada reached out to me wanting to do a cover story for it. And I got a local like
[38:41.020 --> 38:47.700]  rock station wanted to cover it too. Man, that's either a testament to how
[38:48.540 --> 38:55.220]  unique and weird and entertaining you are, or how fucking boring Canada is. I'm not sure which.
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.620]  Honestly, it's a boring for where I locally live. Cause I remember like years ago, the reason why
[39:00.620 --> 39:05.240]  I thought it might happen, I never thought they'd publish it in a paper, but I checked what's
[39:05.240 --> 39:10.800]  happening on local news. And the top story that day was dog carries big stick at the beach.
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.840]  And I was like, I can get in. I can make it into this. I don't know if I'm going to get rid,
[39:17.040 --> 39:22.540]  but there's no way dog carrying big stick on the beach can make the online site. And I can't with
[39:22.540 --> 39:27.900]  these Garfield types. Oh my God. So the Island you cause you live on an Island, right? I do. Yep.
[39:28.180 --> 39:32.400]  In your lifetime of living on that Island, what is the most interesting thing that's happened there?
[39:32.700 --> 39:39.280]  Oh, interesting. Uh, we do bathtub races in the summer. That's kind of like a weird,
[39:39.420 --> 39:44.360]  interesting thing, right? It's like a unique people race bathtubs in the ocean.
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.360]  And it's very serious. Like big ass ceramic or metal bathtubs.
[39:50.360 --> 39:54.960]  Yeah. Like, yeah, I think there are rules that's pretty strict guidelines for what type of tub you
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.580]  can use, but yeah, people strap a motor to a tub and then they elevate it on something. And then
[39:59.580 --> 40:03.900]  they, they drive through a course in the ocean. Like half of them sink. It's a big, it's a serious
[40:03.900 --> 40:10.260]  game. Sure. Surely like a tub wouldn't float. If a wave goes over it immediately just goes down.
[40:10.500 --> 40:14.560]  Yeah. They have to attach to some, it's not just like they're getting tubs and putting
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.920]  them in the water and going, it's like, they're put on top of a structure. I don't know how boats
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.600]  work. So it's just like a boat. It's a boat race where the chair is a tub. I guess. Yeah.
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.400]  Technically. I mean, if you really want to ruin it, Gavin, it's the boat race where they lay in a
[40:29.400 --> 40:34.660]  tub. If we want to get into technicalities. It's kind of like how they had that Red Bull
[40:34.660 --> 40:38.820]  flug tag thing, right? Where you would create your own flying machines and then crash them
[40:38.820 --> 40:43.700]  into the water. Except this is the, this is like the flush tag, I guess. You said that,
[40:43.700 --> 40:49.300]  you said that these things sink. Does that mean that the coast along your island is riddled with
[40:49.300 --> 40:55.420]  old, broken, holy toilet tubs? That's, yeah, that's a great question. I've never seen one,
[40:55.500 --> 41:00.500]  but there must be. The coral reefs now. That's how they're going to rebuild the coral reefs
[41:00.500 --> 41:06.520]  around your island from global warming. Jesus Christ. Do you email strangers every day of
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.160]  your life? No. Why would you think that I do this? What do you mean, why would I think? Because every
[41:11.160 --> 41:14.600]  time I talk to you, you're like, well, I contacted a radio station. Yeah. You reached out to 30
[41:14.600 --> 41:19.460]  companies last week. I talked to Procter and Gamble. That's a good point. I take back what
[41:19.460 --> 41:24.540]  I said. I apologize for being defensive. That was a very good point. Fair point. Yeah. Fair point.
[41:24.760 --> 41:29.560]  Wasn't an insult. Uh, no, I don't do it. You need to have a dumb idea or you need to have
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.740]  a question or something. And then you just reach out to people. It's not hard. Have you ever had
[41:33.740 --> 41:40.800]  an idea that you thought this is too dumb, even for me? My entire, I don't want to say brand,
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.540]  but my lifestyle is based off of whatever the dumbest thing possible is do. Like do that. That's
[41:46.540 --> 41:51.120]  how I was good at griftball. Honestly, my strategy a lot of the time was what is the dumbest thing I
[41:51.120 --> 41:55.880]  could do that they would never predict. And then I do it and then nobody predicts it and it works
[41:55.880 --> 42:01.220]  and it looks cool, but it was really stupid. Yeah. You gotta out dumb people. I feel like I want to
[42:01.220 --> 42:07.980]  start setting you challenges. Like I know, like if I gave you a task, how long until it's complete?
[42:07.980 --> 42:13.540]  If I was to say to you, like, get scammed today, you would have to then be like contacted by one
[42:13.540 --> 42:18.000]  of those scam phone calls and like give them access to your computer and stuff. But I reckon you'd be
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.360]  able to get pretty much anything done in like 20 minutes. Why would I do this? Here's a challenge.
[42:23.420 --> 42:28.160]  Here's a challenge. I'd like to building up what Gavin said. How about I would like to see you
[42:28.160 --> 42:34.720]  scam a Nigerian scammer. Does that have to be today? Well, I got, you know, I got plenty of
[42:34.720 --> 42:41.120]  this. My junk mail is literally filled with this. Yeah. Every email to your spam folder is an
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.460]  opportunity for excellence. They're all just adventures waiting to be departed on. Do you
[42:46.460 --> 42:51.060]  ever get those scam emails where they claim you have footage of you jerking off and you pay them?
[42:54.280 --> 42:58.400]  A decent amount. It's in the rotation right now. I don't know. It seems to be popular.
[42:59.700 --> 43:04.420]  Those, yeah, those were all the rage for a while there and they were scaring the shit out of a lot
[43:04.420 --> 43:12.520]  of gullible people. It's a weird, like, what price would you pay to not have that? Zero dollars.
[43:12.900 --> 43:17.900]  Yeah. I don't, I don't think that would work for me. I don't care. So I'm at war with basket weavers
[43:17.900 --> 43:24.340]  and scammers is what I've gathered from this. Well, you're, you're, I think you've brought,
[43:24.420 --> 43:28.680]  you drug yourself into a war with the basket weaving community. Can it be a war if there's
[43:28.680 --> 43:36.480]  less than 10? You're going to find out. You're going to find out there's such a large goddamn
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.960]  basket weaving community. You had no clue. There's, it's probably like a national sport in
[43:40.960 --> 43:45.300]  some country that you're not even aware of. That's my point. I'd love to know if you're
[43:45.300 --> 43:49.480]  the Michael Jordan of basket weaving, please let me know. If you're the Michael Jordan of
[43:49.480 --> 43:55.080]  basket weaving, the Michael Jordan of Garfield cart racing has a word for you.
[43:56.880 --> 44:02.480]  We should call this the Michael Jordan podcast. Oh, if only we could wonder if Michael Jordan
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.220]  ever faced himself. Yeah. He fucking, he gave up two championships by going to play baseball.
[44:07.400 --> 44:11.180]  That's a pretty big face right there. That's a good point. Oh, well, is there anything else we
[44:11.180 --> 44:16.540]  need to cover today boys? Or have we fucked our faces enough? Yeah. I feel like we covered a lot.
[44:18.240 --> 44:23.580]  We covered, we covered farting and Garfield. There's a lot of thoughts. Andrew started a war
[44:23.580 --> 44:29.480]  with a community that's as old as sheep herding and prostitution, probably. That'll be interesting.
[44:29.820 --> 44:32.580]  What's the minimum number you need for a community? Two.
[44:33.420 --> 44:37.700]  Okay. So it is community. I just wanted to make sure. I feel like the basket weavers are going to
[44:37.700 --> 44:42.760]  go, they'll be gone soon. It'll be, people will 3D print their baskets, I think. And I don't
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.820]  think I'd call them weavers. Yeah, that's a, that's a good point, Gavin. It sounds like you're,
[44:47.820 --> 44:52.800]  you're doubling down on the Andrew side of this thing. You're looking to create some strife with
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.480]  the basket weavers yourself. I'd like to point out, I have no beef with baskets or weavers,
[44:57.840 --> 45:05.060]  or any combination of the two. I love all of my fellow men and women, or however you identify,
[45:05.540 --> 45:11.500]  across this globe. And if weaving baskets is your thing, I support it wholeheartedly. Unlike
[45:11.500 --> 45:15.760]  these two heathens who don't think you should be allowed to breathe the same air as them.
[45:15.900 --> 45:18.740]  I don't think I said that. I just don't think there are any of them.
[45:18.740 --> 45:21.840]  100% they said it. You may not have heard it earlier in the podcast.
[45:22.200 --> 45:24.140]  We might have had to cut it out, but they did say it.
[45:24.420 --> 45:26.420]  I say get in, get out. Time is limited.
[45:26.760 --> 45:30.440]  All right, well, I'm gonna get out then. I'm gonna go do other shit. I'll see you guys in a week.
[45:30.980 --> 45:31.700]  Hey, who are you?
[45:31.960 --> 45:37.720]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and this was, uh, this fucking show we do. What's it called? F*** Face.
[45:38.140 --> 45:41.000]  You are... that was what you say. I was Gavin Free.
[45:41.340 --> 45:41.700]  Oh.
[45:41.900 --> 45:42.100]  Oh.
[45:43.500 --> 45:48.200]  You asked who I was, and I fucking instantly, I jumped to attention.
[45:48.740 --> 45:50.420]  I ask who you are, and you're like,
[45:50.520 --> 45:57.240]  I was reading what Eric wrote, and I was throwing, because I don't want to do what Eric told me to
[45:57.240 --> 46:00.340]  do. I want you to do it. So I said, you know, throw it to you, and then you threw it back to
[46:00.340 --> 46:02.200]  me. I wasn't expecting it. I'm Gavin.
[46:03.820 --> 46:04.540]  I'm Andrew.
[46:04.940 --> 46:10.580]  If you enjoyed this podcast, or maybe if you hated it, but there's somebody in your life who
[46:10.580 --> 46:16.140]  you hate more than the podcast, and you want to spread misery their way, tell them about our
[46:16.140 --> 46:22.000]  podcast, tell them to like it, tell a friend or an enemy, like and subscribe, leave us a review
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.380]  on iTunes or Spotify or any of that nonsense. I feel a bit like a heel saying all this stuff.
[46:27.980 --> 46:31.280]  I usually make fun of other podcasters for doing it, but unfortunately it is...
[46:32.280 --> 46:33.220]  I'm gonna cut all this.
[46:36.160 --> 46:37.700]  I'm tired. It's been a long week.
[46:38.260 --> 46:39.100]  It's been a long week.
[46:39.540 --> 46:40.640]  It has been a very long week.
[46:40.740 --> 46:42.440]  I got a bloody mental day tomorrow.
[46:42.680 --> 46:43.560]  Do you have a mental day?
[46:43.840 --> 46:44.140]  Yeah.
[46:44.500 --> 46:45.180]  A lot of recordings?
[46:45.180 --> 46:46.340]  All down day.
[46:46.600 --> 46:47.620]  How about you, Andrew?
[46:47.940 --> 46:49.260]  I'm in the process of a move.
[46:49.340 --> 46:50.340]  I might not have a desk.
[46:50.560 --> 46:51.560]  So I'm figuring that out.
[46:51.820 --> 46:54.080]  Do you wake up every day and then like...
[46:54.080 --> 46:57.200]  The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is I check the turnip prices,
[46:57.540 --> 46:58.620]  obviously Animal Crossing.
[46:59.100 --> 47:00.080]  Is this still the podcast?
[47:00.320 --> 47:00.880]  Yeah, I think so.
[47:01.060 --> 47:01.360]  I think so.
[47:01.400 --> 47:02.200]  We're ending in a second.
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.300]  Is the first thing you do check your Garfield times?
[47:10.360 --> 47:11.160]  I just think...
[47:11.160 --> 47:12.620]  It was the shittiest ending ever.
[47:12.840 --> 47:13.260]  It didn't end.
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.300]  It's not ending.
[47:14.300 --> 47:15.900]  Eric's losing his mind in the chat.
[47:15.940 --> 47:19.300]  All right, this is how I feel about turnips, right?
[47:19.700 --> 47:21.080]  There's no middle ground.
[47:21.340 --> 47:23.700]  At the beginning of the week, I'm like, I got plenty of time.
[47:23.800 --> 47:26.800]  There's no day where I'm like, I should get my shit together.
[47:26.860 --> 47:29.100]  It goes from like, I've got plenty of time to shit.
[47:29.200 --> 47:31.540]  I'm running out of time to sell these turnips.
[47:31.800 --> 47:32.400]  Are you serious?
[47:32.820 --> 47:33.160]  Yeah.
[47:33.300 --> 47:35.280]  I start to get scared on Tuesday night.
[47:35.540 --> 47:35.880]  Really?
[47:36.200 --> 47:36.500]  Yeah.
[47:37.860 --> 47:40.080]  I got to ship some turnips tonight.
[47:40.480 --> 47:42.100]  Dude, I sold a 604 this week.
[47:42.260 --> 47:42.820]  Did you really?
[47:42.820 --> 47:44.780]  Yeah, one of Emily's friends.
[47:44.960 --> 47:47.480]  Her island in the southern hemisphere was 604.
[47:47.940 --> 47:48.500]  So damn.
[47:48.760 --> 47:50.800]  Like and subscribe.
[47:51.680 --> 47:52.740]  Yeah, do that.
[47:52.940 --> 47:53.440]  F*** face.
[47:53.840 --> 47:54.280]  Love you guys.
[47:56.680 --> 47:57.900]  What an ending.
[48:02.120 --> 48:04.940]  You just started talking about turnips.
[48:06.500 --> 48:07.320]  You did.
[48:07.440 --> 48:12.000]  Could you imagine if you were listening to a podcast ending and they're like,
[48:12.000 --> 48:12.880]  like and subscribe.
[48:13.040 --> 48:14.220]  So what do you do in the morning?
[48:14.380 --> 48:15.080]  Do you get turnips?
[48:18.160 --> 48:19.180]  It trailed off.
[48:19.380 --> 48:21.120]  Then you were like, I'm going to cut this.
[48:21.260 --> 48:25.320]  I was so confused.
[48:25.500 --> 48:26.620]  Is this still the podcast?
[48:27.220 --> 48:27.540]  No!
[48:28.060 --> 48:29.040]  Oh, okay, got it.
[48:29.080 --> 48:30.040]  All right, let's stop.
