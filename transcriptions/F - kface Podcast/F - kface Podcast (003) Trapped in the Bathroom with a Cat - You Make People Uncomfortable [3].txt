[00:00.000 --> 00:03.860]  I'm 32, juggling family, working full time, and earning a bachelor's degree.
[00:04.100 --> 00:08.240]  At University of Phoenix, I earn career relevant skills with every five-week course.
[00:08.440 --> 00:10.780]  Skills I can use now, not just after graduation.
[00:11.240 --> 00:14.560]  Earn skills weeks, not years. Visit phoenix.edu.
[00:25.520 --> 00:32.280]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast. I am the OG F*** Face.
[00:32.460 --> 00:37.060]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and I am joined by my two f*** facey little friends,
[00:37.060 --> 00:40.080]  Gavin Free and Andrew Panton. How's it going, boys?
[00:40.260 --> 00:40.480]  Hello.
[00:40.820 --> 00:42.360]  I'm pretty good. How are you?
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.200]  I'm okay. I gotta ask though, and I think the audience probably wants to know as well,
[00:47.380 --> 00:49.980]  before we go into the podcast, how's the fight going?
[00:50.360 --> 00:52.500]  The fight? Oh, the Garfield fight.
[00:53.040 --> 00:55.580]  No, no, no, no, no, no. It's far more important than the Garfield fight.
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.340]  The, the, your self-declared war on the basket weavers of the world.
[01:00.860 --> 01:02.340]  The BWW, as I know it.
[01:02.420 --> 01:04.900]  It's been picking up, hasn't it? I've seen the comments.
[01:04.900 --> 01:07.800]  Yeah. Have you seen the comments? I was going to say that, you know,
[01:07.840 --> 01:11.520]  like they say, never punch down. And I felt a little bad for how hard
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.640]  we went into the basket weave paint. I didn't see anything. It's non-existent.
[01:15.700 --> 01:18.100]  There's no punching down. There's nothing. It's just air.
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.640]  I saw a comment on the Rooster Teeth site that was pretty defensive about the basket weaving
[01:24.640 --> 01:27.780]  community. I assume they've elected one spokesperson.
[01:28.360 --> 01:31.700]  Well, they didn't have a lot of options. They elected the guy or one.
[01:31.740 --> 01:33.660]  Here's why I think you need to be worried, Andrew.
[01:34.040 --> 01:34.260]  Okay.
[01:34.260 --> 01:40.160]  You live in a world with the internet of instant gratuity, instant call and response.
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.160]  You issued a call to the basket weavers. You expect immediate blowback or hate or pushback
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.780]  from them. But what you don't realize is that the basket weavers of the world are artisans.
[01:51.940 --> 01:58.380]  It takes time to weave a basket slowly. There's patience involved. There's discipline.
[01:58.900 --> 02:02.600]  And I have a feeling that whatever response you're going to receive,
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.500]  whatever measured planned out response you're going to receive is going to have
[02:06.500 --> 02:11.720]  as much love and care put into it as the baskets that they weave.
[02:12.020 --> 02:16.480]  The basket of hate and retribution that they're going to weave up towards you,
[02:16.920 --> 02:21.400]  it may take a while, but I don't want to be in its path when it arrives.
[02:21.540 --> 02:25.440]  Like what's the worst case scenario that I'm going to find a shitty basket on my front door?
[02:25.680 --> 02:26.900]  Yeah, you get like a hamper.
[02:27.520 --> 02:30.660]  Yeah, I'm not scared. I'm not scared of shitty baskets.
[02:30.660 --> 02:34.600]  I think the biggest danger to you is getting cancelled by Wicker.
[02:34.860 --> 02:35.800]  Oh, wow.
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.140]  Terrifying. I'm shaking.
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.400]  How dare they?
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.500]  So, Geoff, I've noticed that we don't have any sponsors yet.
[02:48.840 --> 02:49.960]  I hadn't noticed.
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.780]  I guess it's hard to sponsor a podcast with a name we can't say,
[02:55.020 --> 02:59.760]  and that I tried to search for on our own website earlier, and it didn't come up.
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.900]  Yeah, well, you know, it's ad by design.
[03:04.520 --> 03:04.580]  Yeah.
[03:04.860 --> 03:08.760]  I actually think that there are sponsors coming. We've filled in some inquiries.
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.500]  There are some people out there, there's some products out there that I think that
[03:14.500 --> 03:18.880]  are brave and support the kind of groundbreaking content that we're making,
[03:19.040 --> 03:21.320]  and we're just waiting for them to catch up to us.
[03:21.380 --> 03:22.740]  But we'll get there. Don't worry about that.
[03:22.900 --> 03:29.060]  Yeah, I can't wait for Dollar Shave Club slash F*** Face as a URL that's in the bottom of this
[03:29.060 --> 03:29.460]  podcast.
[03:30.820 --> 03:32.620]  Uh, Dollar Shave Club, if you're listening.
[03:35.960 --> 03:38.660]  Andrew, I want to know how your life is going, buddy.
[03:38.780 --> 03:43.000]  And I'll say, I think I mentioned it in the first or the second one when I talked about
[03:43.540 --> 03:48.680]  how you have basically been the private podcast for Gavin and I for the last few years,
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.400]  where we just live vicariously through your missteps in life.
[03:52.660 --> 03:56.540]  But I've noticed a weird thing since we started the F*** Face podcast.
[03:57.100 --> 04:00.920]  You sent me an absolute wall of hilarious text over the last two days,
[04:00.960 --> 04:04.320]  and I haven't read any of it because now I don't want to.
[04:04.400 --> 04:06.840]  I want to wait to hear it on the podcast for the first time.
[04:07.420 --> 04:13.320]  So it's kind of funny, this podcast that was a result of just the intense friendship and
[04:13.320 --> 04:16.480]  love that I have of spending time with you guys has now killed that.
[04:16.660 --> 04:19.140]  I only want to hear from you during the podcast.
[04:19.420 --> 04:22.440]  I want to be as surprised as the audience about your life.
[04:22.800 --> 04:23.360]  It is a problem.
[04:23.360 --> 04:24.900]  Yeah, I noticed that too.
[04:25.060 --> 04:27.940]  Where it's like I'd go to message either you guys something and it's like, well,
[04:27.940 --> 04:28.740]  why would I do this?
[04:29.380 --> 04:30.820]  I'm never going to talk to either.
[04:30.960 --> 04:32.900]  And we're not going to talk once a week for an hour.
[04:33.080 --> 04:34.440]  It's a relationship going forward.
[04:34.620 --> 04:37.580]  The phone will send the notification and it'll just have like the first sentence
[04:37.580 --> 04:38.880]  of the paragraph that you've written.
[04:39.040 --> 04:41.820]  And it'll be like, so get this and I'll just close it.
[04:43.100 --> 04:48.820]  I read as far as I'm in the bathroom hiding from the movers.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.660]  I think they might be trying to kill me.
[04:50.740 --> 04:52.000]  And I just turned it.
[04:52.000 --> 04:52.720]  I just shut it down.
[04:52.720 --> 04:53.400]  I was like, nope.
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.080]  So you moved.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.320]  I did move.
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.660]  I'm still in the process.
[04:58.860 --> 04:59.660]  Things are everywhere.
[05:00.440 --> 05:01.200]  Yeah, I moved.
[05:01.340 --> 05:05.900]  I don't think it's the great story, but there was a portion of time in which I was locked
[05:05.900 --> 05:09.000]  in my bathroom with my cat with only my underwear.
[05:10.160 --> 05:13.580]  And I had strong concerns that the movers were going to kill me.
[05:13.900 --> 05:14.740]  It was a possibility.
[05:15.160 --> 05:18.440]  I'm trying to figure out how you may have got into this situation.
[05:18.700 --> 05:20.660]  There's no way that you could figure this out.
[05:20.660 --> 05:22.840]  It's a convoluted mess.
[05:22.940 --> 05:24.780]  How did you not know that they were?
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.040]  How?
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.000]  How did they get?
[05:27.480 --> 05:27.880]  Huh?
[05:28.200 --> 05:29.540]  No, they didn't know I existed.
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.920]  Why did you think they were going to kill you?
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.200]  Because they didn't know I existed.
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.720]  And I was sitting in a bathroom.
[05:35.140 --> 05:36.320]  So someone else let them in?
[05:36.560 --> 05:36.860]  Yes.
[05:37.120 --> 05:38.760]  Someone else was conducting the move.
[05:39.160 --> 05:42.120]  I was with the cat that has panic attacks when new people come in.
[05:42.400 --> 05:43.520]  I was keeping the cat calm.
[05:44.160 --> 05:44.800]  Things happened.
[05:44.920 --> 05:46.340]  The cat got covered in litter.
[05:46.940 --> 05:49.020]  I ended up with only my underwear left.
[05:49.020 --> 05:51.300]  Oh, because you got caked in feces and litter?
[05:51.780 --> 05:55.260]  No, I drenched my own clothes in water because I tried to have a bath.
[05:56.820 --> 05:57.660]  Wait a minute.
[05:58.040 --> 05:58.660]  Wait a minute.
[05:59.680 --> 06:00.940]  Let me make sure I have this right.
[06:01.260 --> 06:01.420]  Okay.
[06:01.620 --> 06:05.300]  You were in the middle of moving and there were movers moving your house.
[06:05.540 --> 06:08.220]  And you're trapped in a bathroom with a cat trying to keep it calm.
[06:08.400 --> 06:11.780]  And you thought, well, light some candles and have a bubble bath.
[06:12.000 --> 06:14.960]  Well, if you're going to be in a bathroom for like two hours,
[06:15.120 --> 06:16.900]  you eventually run out of things to do.
[06:16.900 --> 06:17.900]  So have a bath.
[06:18.380 --> 06:22.660]  And the tough part is you feel incredibly guilty when you're having a bath
[06:22.660 --> 06:25.060]  while people are lifting heavy furniture of yours.
[06:25.340 --> 06:27.800]  So I was trying to be really sneaky of like, oh, they're downstairs?
[06:28.220 --> 06:29.180]  Turn some water on.
[06:29.360 --> 06:30.920]  Turn it off when they come back up.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.260]  They had no idea I was there.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.000]  It was great.
[06:33.440 --> 06:34.820]  I did great in that department.
[06:35.980 --> 06:36.980]  But things took a turn.
[06:36.980 --> 06:40.320]  Just like the idea of you, just you're with a bath.
[06:40.420 --> 06:42.200]  So you're like, oh, I've got to use it now.
[06:42.720 --> 06:43.180]  Been in here longer.
[06:43.180 --> 06:43.460]  Yeah.
[06:43.940 --> 06:45.140]  Why don't you start from the beginning?
[06:45.140 --> 06:47.640]  We should just, I want to hear this story in its entirety.
[06:47.840 --> 06:49.340]  I mean, it's sort of the story.
[06:49.500 --> 06:52.820]  Like I left before the movers arrived at the original house,
[06:53.420 --> 06:54.900]  took the cat to the new place,
[06:55.280 --> 06:58.260]  hung out there until the mover showed up, then moved the cat to the bathroom.
[06:58.900 --> 07:01.680]  And then, yeah, that just, I tried to have a bath.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.700]  When I got out, I launched water fucking everywhere.
[07:05.200 --> 07:06.180]  All over the bath.
[07:06.580 --> 07:07.500]  Got on the cat's tail.
[07:07.620 --> 07:09.380]  Cat panicked, ran into the litter box.
[07:09.720 --> 07:12.580]  Cat now has a tail of litter because it all stuck to it.
[07:12.860 --> 07:13.800]  Cat's freaking out.
[07:14.300 --> 07:17.900]  And I'm just sitting on a toilet with just my underwear on, hoping they don't find me.
[07:18.120 --> 07:20.340]  Because all I can think about is that movie Burn After Reading,
[07:20.840 --> 07:24.160]  where like George Clooney finds Brad Pitt in the closet and shoots him in the face.
[07:24.360 --> 07:25.660]  I'm like, the movers are going to find me.
[07:25.940 --> 07:26.940]  They're not going to know who I am.
[07:26.980 --> 07:28.180]  They're going to think I'm a crazy person.
[07:28.440 --> 07:29.540]  And they're going to attack me.
[07:29.740 --> 07:31.040]  This is going to escalate in some way.
[07:31.340 --> 07:33.000]  So I was just trying to be really quiet.
[07:33.500 --> 07:34.540]  Were there other bathrooms?
[07:35.040 --> 07:37.180]  Were you worried that one of the movers would come and take a piss?
[07:37.300 --> 07:37.800]  There are three.
[07:37.940 --> 07:38.760]  Yeah, no, I'm good.
[07:39.260 --> 07:40.080]  That wasn't a concern.
[07:40.580 --> 07:40.700]  Yeah.
[07:40.820 --> 07:42.560]  How long were you in the bathroom for?
[07:42.560 --> 07:47.600]  Uh, 10 a.m. until 5 p.m., 4 p.m. maybe?
[07:47.780 --> 07:48.380]  Oh my god.
[07:48.380 --> 07:49.360]  Oh my god.
[07:49.380 --> 07:50.440]  Why don't you just come out?
[07:50.560 --> 07:51.880]  That's a full day.
[07:52.100 --> 07:53.020]  Well, I don't know.
[07:53.200 --> 07:53.800]  What's your...
[07:53.800 --> 07:54.540]  Yeah, what's your...
[07:54.540 --> 07:56.140]  I mean, what am I going to do?
[07:56.480 --> 07:57.600]  I'm not going to help the move.
[07:58.620 --> 08:03.760]  I'd rather the movers not know I exist than feel guilty that they know I exist and I'm not helping.
[08:04.440 --> 08:06.000]  So did you just sit...
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.580]  You said your clothes got soaked.
[08:07.940 --> 08:08.280]  Yeah.
[08:08.860 --> 08:09.640]  So were you...
[08:09.640 --> 08:10.460]  You sit...
[08:10.460 --> 08:12.240]  What time did you take the bath?
[08:12.560 --> 08:18.020]  I took the bath probably... I took the bath at like 1 p.m. maybe.
[08:18.320 --> 08:18.460]  Okay.
[08:18.920 --> 08:20.820]  And were you trying to save it?
[08:21.200 --> 08:23.980]  Were you like, I don't want to take a bath immediately because then I've exhausted all
[08:23.980 --> 08:27.640]  of this room has to offer, so I'm going to wait out as long as I can?
[08:27.860 --> 08:29.700]  I've been going I am legend style.
[08:29.840 --> 08:33.080]  I was just laying in the bath with my clothes on for most of the day.
[08:35.360 --> 08:37.040]  Because it's the only place to stretch out.
[08:37.080 --> 08:37.840]  It was a small bathroom.
[08:38.740 --> 08:41.740]  Do you have any bath crayons or army men to play with or anything?
[08:41.740 --> 08:44.740]  I had my cell phone and let me...
[08:44.740 --> 08:46.840]  Oh, this was an all time disaster.
[08:47.120 --> 08:47.880]  I had the charger.
[08:48.220 --> 08:49.020]  My phone died.
[08:49.120 --> 08:50.520]  It's my only source of entertainment.
[08:50.980 --> 08:52.160]  It's like, it's their outlets in here.
[08:52.200 --> 08:52.540]  It's fine.
[08:52.720 --> 08:53.980]  Outlets don't work in the bathroom.
[08:54.420 --> 08:55.320]  That was devastating.
[08:55.740 --> 08:56.660]  Couldn't charge the phone.
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.000]  That was a whole endeavor.
[08:58.100 --> 09:01.640]  I had to tiptoe out of the bathroom to charge it and like peak to see when they...
[09:01.640 --> 09:02.880]  Because they had to do multiple loads.
[09:03.600 --> 09:05.460]  So you'd wait until it was clear.
[09:05.680 --> 09:05.900]  Yeah.
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.600]  Once it was all clear, I got a nice 30 minute charge in and I was all good.
[09:09.720 --> 09:11.220]  Just coasted the rest of the way.
[09:11.220 --> 09:13.480]  Just scurry away back to the bathroom.
[09:13.600 --> 09:15.380]  Yeah, immediately ran back to the bathroom.
[09:15.740 --> 09:17.260]  I only had my underwear.
[09:18.280 --> 09:21.640]  I can tell like it became a game for you eventually, right?
[09:21.940 --> 09:23.580]  No, it's pretty miserable by the way.
[09:23.680 --> 09:24.800]  I'm not gonna lie about it.
[09:24.860 --> 09:27.640]  This wasn't a great experience by any stretch.
[09:27.880 --> 09:28.520]  I was tired.
[09:29.320 --> 09:31.460]  We moved a lot of stuff before the movers came.
[09:31.520 --> 09:32.760]  So it's physically exhausted.
[09:32.960 --> 09:35.660]  It was an experience, but not a positive one.
[09:35.820 --> 09:37.200]  So what did you do for sustenance?
[09:37.440 --> 09:39.460]  Oh, I ordered pizza the day before.
[09:39.460 --> 09:41.840]  And I brought the pizza into the back.
[09:41.960 --> 09:43.160]  I had the pizza and I had a cookie.
[09:43.620 --> 09:46.120]  And I got one of maybe the smartest things I've ever done.
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.020]  Is the night before the move, I put my toothbrush in the cookie box.
[09:50.380 --> 09:52.380]  So I'm like, there's no way I'm going to remember to move this.
[09:52.700 --> 09:54.600]  And I'm definitely going to eat that cookie tomorrow.
[09:55.240 --> 09:56.300]  For God, I did it.
[09:56.540 --> 10:00.880]  When I opened the cookie box to find the toothbrush, it was like I found a million dollars.
[10:01.020 --> 10:02.440]  It's like, you're a fucking genius.
[10:02.920 --> 10:04.900]  It's the only way you would have brought this.
[10:10.210 --> 10:11.550]  Well, I'm impressed it worked.
[10:11.550 --> 10:14.250]  You know yourself better than anyone, I guess.
[10:14.810 --> 10:15.710]  That was day one.
[10:16.910 --> 10:19.870]  Then, do we want to get into where I'm at right now?
[10:19.890 --> 10:20.510]  What's going on?
[10:21.010 --> 10:22.110]  Yeah, I have a situation.
[10:22.430 --> 10:23.970]  Do you guys see the Discord chat?
[10:24.490 --> 10:25.450]  I've never used this.
[10:26.370 --> 10:27.270]  Let me post it.
[10:27.570 --> 10:32.190]  So, my room has an echo in it.
[10:32.830 --> 10:33.490]  There's an echo.
[10:33.570 --> 10:34.550]  I don't know what to do about it.
[10:35.050 --> 10:36.390]  I don't know how sound works.
[10:38.870 --> 10:39.270]  So...
[10:39.270 --> 10:39.950]  Do you not need furniture?
[10:40.570 --> 10:42.130]  No, I have furniture in it.
[10:42.270 --> 10:42.970]  It's just, I don't know.
[10:43.050 --> 10:44.530]  Everything is solid, I guess.
[10:44.590 --> 10:45.610]  I don't know how echo...
[10:45.610 --> 10:47.490]  I don't know how any of this works, but I have an echo.
[10:47.930 --> 10:48.070]  It was a problem.
[10:48.070 --> 10:48.690]  Get a rug.
[10:49.190 --> 10:50.190]  Put some shit on the walls.
[10:50.430 --> 10:53.350]  Are you living in maybe a mausoleum or a train station?
[10:53.770 --> 10:54.150]  Yeah.
[10:55.470 --> 10:56.730]  Yeah, you know, honestly...
[10:56.730 --> 10:58.690]  Is the ceiling tiled and curved?
[10:59.070 --> 11:02.390]  It's a high ceiling and everything is really...
[11:02.390 --> 11:03.550]  There might be cement in the walls.
[11:03.670 --> 11:04.070]  I don't know.
[11:04.130 --> 11:05.230]  Everything's very solid.
[11:05.370 --> 11:08.850]  It's great for soundproofing, as far as being around other people.
[11:09.670 --> 11:11.230]  So I didn't know what to do.
[11:11.490 --> 11:18.430]  So I spent all of yesterday rearranging my room and lifting heavy boxes from a different floor.
[11:19.050 --> 11:21.230]  And I'm living in...
[11:21.230 --> 11:23.550]  I'm currently in like a pillow fort.
[11:23.990 --> 11:24.970]  I'm in a shit...
[11:24.970 --> 11:26.250]  I've got four corners.
[11:26.250 --> 11:26.710]  Oh, I see the picture.
[11:27.430 --> 11:29.010]  Yeah, I got all of my blankets.
[11:29.170 --> 11:30.450]  I'm using shower curtains.
[11:30.630 --> 11:31.370]  I'm contained.
[11:31.670 --> 11:35.510]  I currently have a blanket against my head because I didn't make the roof high enough.
[11:36.190 --> 11:36.830]  But this is my life.
[11:36.850 --> 11:37.430]  Oh my lord.
[11:38.150 --> 11:40.610]  I'm just surrounded in blankets.
[11:40.770 --> 11:42.330]  Well, yeah, I don't hear any echo.
[11:42.490 --> 11:44.070]  So mission accomplished there.
[11:44.510 --> 11:45.230]  Yeah, congratulations.
[11:45.550 --> 11:47.510]  I can't even hear the train conductor.
[11:47.550 --> 11:48.270]  This is perfect.
[11:49.710 --> 11:53.710]  So did you move to the same cold Canadian island?
[11:54.070 --> 11:56.250]  Yeah, still same area.
[11:56.950 --> 11:58.230]  Yeah, different.
[11:58.530 --> 12:02.070]  So you won't be missing out on the bathtub boat race anytime soon?
[12:02.190 --> 12:03.390]  No, I won't be.
[12:03.450 --> 12:04.470]  I'm actually closer.
[12:05.050 --> 12:07.270]  They fire a cannon once a year.
[12:07.270 --> 12:09.050]  And that's going to be a thing.
[12:09.130 --> 12:10.370]  I'm going to do that a lot more.
[12:10.370 --> 12:13.150]  When is the boat race?
[12:13.330 --> 12:14.910]  It's typically in July.
[12:15.190 --> 12:18.230]  They canceled it because of COVID, obviously, this year.
[12:18.710 --> 12:20.290]  So no boat racing.
[12:20.550 --> 12:26.430]  I'm going to say right now, if this podcast is still going next July, if the world still
[12:26.430 --> 12:32.490]  exists next July, and we haven't all succumbed to COVID, I think we should enter into the
[12:32.490 --> 12:33.030]  fucking race.
[12:33.250 --> 12:34.990]  I think we should enter into the race.
[12:34.990 --> 12:39.330]  Or at least try and do a podcast from the race and commentate on it.
[12:39.570 --> 12:41.070]  Do a live remote from it, yeah.
[12:41.150 --> 12:43.350]  I want to be there when that cannon fires too.
[12:44.790 --> 12:45.650]  It's the thing.
[12:46.030 --> 12:48.990]  Yeah, I mean, it's not that hard.
[12:49.090 --> 12:50.650]  I don't think we want to ride.
[12:50.730 --> 12:52.790]  It's very uncomfortable, from my understanding.
[12:53.150 --> 12:55.330]  Riding in a bathtub in the ocean is apparently terrible.
[12:55.850 --> 12:56.490]  Not fun at all.
[12:57.010 --> 12:59.710]  But maybe we could sponsor a racer?
[12:59.790 --> 13:03.210]  Can we stick a balloon on it or something and just float slightly above the ocean?
[13:03.330 --> 13:04.330]  Do you have to be on the water?
[13:04.990 --> 13:06.190]  I think you have to be on the water.
[13:06.670 --> 13:06.870]  All right.
[13:06.930 --> 13:11.290]  It'd be really sad to see a f*** face balloon slowly float down.
[13:13.050 --> 13:15.870]  Well, we have about a year to plan.
[13:17.310 --> 13:21.770]  So we just need to start understanding... what is it?
[13:22.050 --> 13:22.410]  Bathtubs?
[13:22.550 --> 13:23.770]  Is that what the race is?
[13:24.070 --> 13:26.270]  How long does it take to buy a giant balloon?
[13:26.830 --> 13:27.710]  How long does it take?
[13:27.850 --> 13:28.330]  What do you mean?
[13:28.550 --> 13:32.610]  Yeah, like when you put the order in for a hot air balloon or like a big blimp with an
[13:32.610 --> 13:33.290]  ad on the side.
[13:33.290 --> 13:35.670]  That's got to be at least six months.
[13:36.230 --> 13:36.830]  Hey, dickhead.
[13:37.110 --> 13:37.790]  Can I ask you a question?
[13:38.270 --> 13:40.710]  Didn't you get famous off of giant red balloons?
[13:40.950 --> 13:41.930]  I don't mean a balloon.
[13:41.950 --> 13:43.390]  You have like a lifetime supply of them.
[13:43.630 --> 13:45.390]  So you just fill it with helium.
[13:45.770 --> 13:47.950]  You can't fly that over a bathtub race.
[13:47.990 --> 13:49.770]  It's a six foot tall balloon.
[13:49.930 --> 13:51.730]  You put three of them together and fill them with helium.
[13:51.950 --> 13:52.090]  What?
[13:52.170 --> 13:53.610]  Have you ever seen a hot air balloon?
[13:53.790 --> 13:56.330]  A hot air balloon is like 15 meters.
[13:56.630 --> 13:56.870]  What?
[13:56.870 --> 13:58.970]  How did they mess it up?
[13:59.610 --> 14:00.770]  45 feet wide.
[14:02.870 --> 14:05.670]  You know the problem with hot air balloons and where you're going to run into an issue.
[14:05.970 --> 14:07.650]  You know what the baskets are made out of, right?
[14:09.130 --> 14:09.850]  Oh, shit.
[14:10.290 --> 14:13.150]  We'll put in the order for the balloon and no one will weave the basket.
[14:13.890 --> 14:17.150]  They're going to weave some weak spots.
[14:19.250 --> 14:19.770]  Oh, yeah.
[14:19.770 --> 14:21.610]  I'm looking at the other pictures of this fort.
[14:21.870 --> 14:23.490]  I can see a Home Depot box.
[14:23.790 --> 14:25.090]  Oh, it's all Home Depot boxes.
[14:25.090 --> 14:26.950]  It looks good, man.
[14:27.270 --> 14:29.450]  It's not, but I appreciate you saying it.
[14:31.550 --> 14:33.710]  Well, congratulations on surviving the move.
[14:33.830 --> 14:35.050]  Congratulations on your bath.
[14:35.090 --> 14:36.110]  I assume you got clean.
[14:36.730 --> 14:39.070]  I assume the cat has been clean since then.
[14:39.610 --> 14:41.330]  And you're all hunkered down.
[14:41.590 --> 14:44.350]  And it sounds like you even got your little bedroom fort going.
[14:45.570 --> 14:47.590]  You got to be living high on the hog right now.
[14:47.890 --> 14:48.970]  No, not at all.
[14:49.150 --> 14:50.390]  But thank you once again.
[14:50.790 --> 14:53.210]  I'm exhausted, but we're here.
[14:54.270 --> 14:54.970]  In a fort.
[14:55.770 --> 14:56.890]  Talking about baskets.
[14:57.390 --> 14:58.970]  I just realized I kind of fucked up.
[14:59.730 --> 15:01.990]  You know, I've been recording my farts for a while.
[15:02.410 --> 15:02.610]  Yeah.
[15:02.810 --> 15:05.930]  And I went through a bit of a fart drought where I just didn't have any...
[15:05.930 --> 15:09.270]  There was no gas left in the tank for about a week there.
[15:09.590 --> 15:15.410]  But I've since rebounded and I've been recording my farts with a creative furiosity, I'll say.
[15:15.630 --> 15:17.630]  Have you assigned them all to various people
[15:17.630 --> 15:20.150]  or are they sort of going into a miscellaneous bucket right now?
[15:20.270 --> 15:22.930]  They're going into kind of like a thought bucket right now
[15:22.930 --> 15:24.310]  where I'm trying to figure out what to do with them.
[15:24.370 --> 15:25.830]  I'm pretty sure I want to make a soundboard.
[15:26.270 --> 15:30.310]  Anyway, the way I fucked up is I farted a perfect question fart the other day.
[15:30.470 --> 15:30.730]  Oh.
[15:30.930 --> 15:35.150]  And it's amazing, but I wanted to have it prepped so I could play it for you guys.
[15:35.230 --> 15:36.650]  And I don't know which one it is.
[15:36.670 --> 15:38.730]  And I don't want to just play a thousand farts for you.
[15:38.810 --> 15:39.450]  You might have to listen.
[15:40.970 --> 15:42.930]  I feel like if you're going to start this,
[15:42.930 --> 15:45.310]  you might as well start organizing them properly from the beginning.
[15:45.350 --> 15:46.290]  Like you need keywords.
[15:46.510 --> 15:47.810]  You need titles on these.
[15:48.310 --> 15:48.870]  I think you're right.
[15:48.970 --> 15:49.490]  They need to be searchable.
[15:49.970 --> 15:52.850]  The thing that I like about them is that they're called,
[15:53.110 --> 15:55.790]  like, you know, I recorded number 35 this morning.
[15:56.310 --> 15:59.810]  Like, I just love that I have 35 individual farts on my phone.
[15:59.910 --> 16:01.990]  I just wish I knew which one is the question fart.
[16:02.110 --> 16:03.650]  Well, the one you sent me, I think, was 20.
[16:04.670 --> 16:05.570]  That was 20? Oh, yeah.
[16:05.570 --> 16:09.710]  So you've recorded 15 farts since the one I got.
[16:09.750 --> 16:09.990]  Yeah.
[16:10.410 --> 16:11.530]  Well, here's what I'm going to do for you.
[16:11.670 --> 16:15.070]  I'm going to promise you that I will get it ready
[16:15.070 --> 16:18.470]  and I will prep my question fart for next episode.
[16:18.970 --> 16:21.450]  You should play it instead of asking a question.
[16:22.110 --> 16:22.770]  I will.
[16:22.970 --> 16:23.490]  I will.
[16:23.890 --> 16:25.610]  So when someone says something, you're just like, huh?
[16:25.770 --> 16:26.410]  But with the fart.
[16:27.170 --> 16:27.830]  Oh, my God.
[16:28.130 --> 16:28.850]  That's a great idea.
[16:28.970 --> 16:30.370]  I want to have a whole soundboard of,
[16:30.490 --> 16:33.410]  I want to see if I can emote only in farts going forward.
[16:34.690 --> 16:35.890]  You need a lot of farts.
[16:36.110 --> 16:36.810]  Like Lassie.
[16:37.950 --> 16:38.510]  How many?
[16:38.710 --> 16:39.970]  Like, when are you going to start rotating?
[16:40.930 --> 16:44.190]  Eventually, you'll be able to tell us that someone stuck down a well using only farts.
[16:47.650 --> 16:48.410]  Oh, God.
[16:48.970 --> 16:49.490]  Uh.

[18:13.850 --> 18:15.070]  Chipotle. For real.
[18:16.190 --> 18:18.330]  I had a question I wanted to ask you, Geoff.
[18:18.430 --> 18:23.390]  It's not a regular f***face because it wasn't screwing myself over.
[18:24.050 --> 18:28.890]  But I played a prank on you recently and there was absolutely no payoff.
[18:29.130 --> 18:32.290]  And I get the feeling that you didn't notice in the slightest.
[18:32.850 --> 18:33.390]  Are you serious?
[18:33.770 --> 18:34.930]  Do you have any idea what it was?
[18:35.650 --> 18:40.090]  Is this like the thing where you've been telling me we're friends for 20 years?
[18:41.610 --> 18:42.430]  17 years?
[18:42.430 --> 18:48.890]  No, it was at the stream we did right before we stopped going to work.
[18:49.070 --> 18:51.730]  That big where we played like Electric Jenga and all that stuff.
[18:51.950 --> 18:54.550]  Like the big 12 hour Achievement Hunter stream?
[18:54.990 --> 18:55.010]  Okay.
[18:55.170 --> 18:59.290]  You, at one point during that stream, found a load of super glue
[18:59.790 --> 19:03.850]  and you started sticking shit to the let's roll table.
[19:04.090 --> 19:05.710]  I glued everything in sight, yes.
[19:05.770 --> 19:05.990]  Yeah.
[19:06.570 --> 19:09.770]  And nobody can tell me no because I'm the boss, which is like the greatest thing.
[19:10.090 --> 19:11.450]  I saw so much displeasure.
[19:11.450 --> 19:14.230]  Before you get there, I just want you to know.
[19:14.550 --> 19:17.710]  It wasn't lost on me when I do something like that,
[19:17.770 --> 19:20.710]  that it is annoying to everybody involved but me.
[19:20.970 --> 19:22.490]  I saw Trevor was annoyed.
[19:22.730 --> 19:23.490]  Lewis was annoyed.
[19:23.710 --> 19:25.050]  Everybody was not having it.
[19:25.350 --> 19:28.630]  And all that does is just make me want to glue more shit.
[19:28.890 --> 19:30.470]  Yeah, it's fuel for you.
[19:30.750 --> 19:33.630]  And you were sticking really pointless stuff.
[19:33.790 --> 19:35.910]  Like it was powerful super glue.
[19:36.130 --> 19:39.070]  The sort of thing where it's like if you touch the cap
[19:39.070 --> 19:40.690]  and you get just a little bit of residue,
[19:40.690 --> 19:44.110]  it will stick your fingers together and it'll be sticky for ages
[19:44.110 --> 19:45.570]  unless you immediately wipe it off.
[19:46.050 --> 19:48.070]  And you stuck stuff like paper to it.
[19:48.190 --> 19:53.050]  So it's just like ripped paper now stuck to that really nice table.
[19:53.350 --> 19:58.430]  Anyway, after you'd done that, I picked up one of the little super glues
[19:59.210 --> 20:02.790]  and you were sat on the floor, but you were sort of sat on your knees.
[20:03.050 --> 20:03.370]  Okay.
[20:03.750 --> 20:10.210]  So your shoes, if you can imagine it, were stuck out, soles up, facing me.
[20:10.210 --> 20:16.090]  So I just crouched down behind you and I dumped an entire tube of super glue
[20:16.850 --> 20:18.570]  all over both of your shoes.
[20:19.890 --> 20:21.790]  And you never said a word about it.
[20:22.250 --> 20:25.990]  So, and then I turned around and walked around with sticky shoes?
[20:26.290 --> 20:27.890]  Yeah, and you never reacted to it at all.
[20:28.430 --> 20:30.570]  Well, how long did I sit there for?
[20:30.710 --> 20:34.870]  Was it possible I sat there for more than seven to 10 seconds, you moron?
[20:35.130 --> 20:37.130]  What is that? Is it dry after 10 seconds?
[20:37.310 --> 20:38.590]  It's fucking super glue, buddy.
[20:38.590 --> 20:41.130]  It dries fast. It's quick drying. It says it on the label.
[20:41.670 --> 20:44.190]  Shit. So I just, like, fixed your shoes.
[20:45.310 --> 20:46.430]  I'm like a gobbler.
[20:48.890 --> 20:50.810]  You just repaired my shoes.
[20:51.130 --> 20:53.370]  Hey, thanks for fixing my shoes, man.
[20:53.550 --> 20:55.390]  It was a real friend thing to do.
[20:55.690 --> 20:58.650]  It was so much glue, though. I can't... I'm really annoyed.
[20:59.210 --> 21:00.830]  What color were my shoes? Do you remember?
[21:02.170 --> 21:04.370]  They were Vans. The bottom were kind of like pale brown.
[21:04.530 --> 21:06.230]  They were Vans and they were brown.
[21:06.230 --> 21:11.670]  So you described, I have a closet with 65 pairs of pale brown bottomed Vans.
[21:12.190 --> 21:14.910]  But only one of them has a really secure sole.
[21:15.370 --> 21:16.990]  I'll look for it. I'll look for it.
[21:17.290 --> 21:17.690]  Lord.
[21:18.250 --> 21:22.550]  And you were flummoxed that I never figured out that you glued my shoes to nothing.
[21:22.890 --> 21:24.550]  I wasn't, like, waiting for the reaction.
[21:24.710 --> 21:28.390]  I assumed that you would at some point start fussing that you had glued to the floor and,
[21:28.550 --> 21:31.610]  like, the carpet was sticking. But it was, like, two days later and I was like,
[21:31.690 --> 21:34.410]  oh yeah, nothing happened with the glue.
[21:34.410 --> 21:38.570]  If we ever start a new podcast called Dipshit Face, you're gonna host.
[21:41.990 --> 21:44.610]  How many pairs of shoes do you have, Geoff?
[21:44.730 --> 21:46.370]  I have a lot, dude.
[21:46.610 --> 21:47.110]  Are you serious?
[21:47.430 --> 21:48.710]  Oh, you didn't know that about me?
[21:48.990 --> 21:49.170]  No.
[21:49.270 --> 21:54.230]  Yeah, I'm addicted. The thing that I'm not embarrassed about collecting is Vans.
[21:54.430 --> 21:56.850]  I have probably 60 pairs of Vans, yeah.
[21:56.990 --> 21:58.190]  Just Vans or, like...
[21:58.910 --> 22:01.470]  No, no, no, no, no, just Vans. I only collect Vans.
[22:01.470 --> 22:06.230]  I'm embarrassed to say now, Andrew, and Gavin, this won't mean anything to you,
[22:06.770 --> 22:11.690]  but Andrew, I am embarrassed to say I own one pair of Kyrie Irvings because they were Celtics colors.
[22:12.050 --> 22:15.050]  Yeah, I have the same. I'm in the same embarrassing boat. I've got a fucking
[22:15.050 --> 22:19.710]  Uncle Drew poster, so I'm in a whole other tier of mistakes with Kyrie Irving.
[22:20.450 --> 22:23.790]  The way before he broke all of our hearts.
[22:24.030 --> 22:28.570]  Yeah, I had a weird realization once where I was wearing an Isaiah Thomas t-shirt and I was
[22:28.570 --> 22:34.930]  Kyrie Irving runners. I wouldn't own these runners if the guy on my shirt wasn't traded
[22:34.930 --> 22:38.710]  for the guy I'm wearing the shoes of. It was a bizarre trade realization.
[22:39.350 --> 22:42.070]  My entire outfit was dictated by Celtics trades.
[22:42.930 --> 22:47.810]  You wouldn't know this, but it's so bad in the NBA with players getting traded back and forth
[22:47.810 --> 22:52.810]  and no team loyalty that I think it's American Express, I want to say.
[22:53.130 --> 22:55.670]  If you buy a basketball jersey through them,
[22:55.670 --> 22:59.590]  you get a year of insurance in case the player gets traded to another team.
[22:59.850 --> 23:00.430]  Like a guarantee.
[23:01.510 --> 23:04.470]  Yeah, you're like, I just dropped 150 bucks on a fucking LeBron,
[23:04.910 --> 23:10.870]  you know, Cleveland jersey and he went to LA Lakers. I'll just use my American Express or
[23:10.870 --> 23:13.870]  whatever. Maybe it was Chase Manhattan or one of those credit card companies,
[23:13.950 --> 23:17.190]  but I'll just use my credit card insurance to get my new Lakers jersey.
[23:17.370 --> 23:21.450]  I only know about the constant trading from the beginning of basketball.
[23:24.050 --> 23:26.890]  What a great primer basketball ended up being for a lot of things.
[23:29.590 --> 23:33.510]  Andrew, do you, uh, speaking of f*** facing, which is what this podcast is,
[23:33.670 --> 23:38.250]  do you want to talk a little bit about your, oh, I don't want to say a war, but your, your...
[23:38.830 --> 23:40.610]  No, we became friends.
[23:40.890 --> 23:44.070]  Yeah. How you befriended, was it the Australian post office?
[23:44.250 --> 23:48.510]  The Australian post office. Yeah, we talked a little bit. You and I were just kind of getting
[23:48.510 --> 23:54.710]  into collecting cards and I had just learned that they made entertainment cards, like for movies,
[23:54.710 --> 23:59.070]  like they had Rocky two cards, a Joss cards, a lot of cards from the eighties, but they even do it
[23:59.070 --> 24:03.130]  for more modern properties now. And I kind of became obsessed with trying to collect like
[24:03.130 --> 24:07.410]  the dumbest autographs I could find. Like I bought a bunch of battlefield earth cards and
[24:07.410 --> 24:12.510]  got a Forest Whitaker signed battlefield earth trading card. Before you go any further, I gotta
[24:12.510 --> 24:21.070]  know, do these cards hold any value? Oh, no. Okay. These are, these are purely face collectibles.
[24:21.310 --> 24:25.990]  They're purely face collectibles. In fact, I'd say the less value they hold, the more valuable
[24:25.990 --> 24:32.250]  they are to my heart. Do you think you, you might have the only Forest Whitaker autograph with no
[24:32.250 --> 24:37.170]  value? It's, you know, honestly, I might have the only Forest Whitaker at this point. It was a
[24:37.170 --> 24:41.990]  really rare card. He signed like 500 of them and they thought that movie was going to be big.
[24:41.990 --> 24:46.370]  So they made a lot of cards. It was a really rare get, I don't know what the numbers are,
[24:46.470 --> 24:51.850]  but it was like a super lucky pull. When we make the officiable face collectible guide,
[24:52.010 --> 24:55.850]  we'll put that one in there for sure. Did you say officiable?
[24:59.090 --> 25:04.470]  Officiable. Officiable. Did I know what I said? I think you said officiable. Did I? No,
[25:04.550 --> 25:09.610]  I think I said the officiable. If I make the officiable, that's what we're going to call it.
[25:09.610 --> 25:15.130]  The officiable face collectible guide. It's the officiable list.
[25:20.010 --> 25:25.890]  God, it's been a long life. Still going though.
[25:26.270 --> 25:29.090]  Dude, I turned 45 pretty soon. Shit.
[25:29.910 --> 25:32.210]  Yeah. That's halfway to 90.
[25:32.690 --> 25:38.370]  I know, dude. Halfway. That means I'm almost halfway through my life because I'm going to
[25:38.370 --> 25:40.870]  be at least 100 now that I think about it. Do you think so?
[25:41.170 --> 25:46.670]  Oh yeah. Everybody in my life lives forever. I guess you eat well, you exercise, you don't
[25:46.670 --> 25:49.010]  drink anymore. It's good shit. I think you'll make it.
[25:49.490 --> 25:54.170]  That's probably what's going to do me in. I probably shouldn't have changed course. It's
[25:54.170 --> 26:00.470]  been 40 something years building up all those immunities. Anyway, Andrew, how did you fall
[26:00.470 --> 26:02.510]  in love with the Australian Post Office? Was it because of Forest Whitaker?
[26:02.690 --> 26:06.450]  It was because of Forest Whitaker. Yeah, I got hooked. Once I pulled the Forest Whitaker card,
[26:06.450 --> 26:11.010]  it became a full obsession, and I was convinced I could pull any card I wanted. And I ordered
[26:11.010 --> 26:16.370]  all these cards off of eBay, not knowing they were from Australia. And as soon as I ordered
[26:16.370 --> 26:20.470]  them, I was double-checking the order, and I noticed I sent them to an address I lived
[26:20.470 --> 26:24.730]  in five years ago. It was a while since I had used that. I signed into the wrong eBay
[26:24.730 --> 26:26.330]  account. The crusty old eBay account.
[26:26.410 --> 26:30.890]  Yeah. I signed into the wrong account, and I shipped them to an address that I lived in
[26:30.890 --> 26:34.850]  five years ago. And I immediately reached out to them, and they said, there's nothing
[26:34.850 --> 26:39.710]  we could do. We immediately shipped out everything. We can't change the address. But they recommended
[26:39.710 --> 26:44.350]  I try to get in contact with the Canadian Post to redirect the package. So I got in
[26:44.350 --> 26:51.170]  contact with them. They said, nothing we can do. So then I was kind of left with, what
[26:51.170 --> 26:56.870]  do I do? It's mailing. I can track this order. I can see it slowly getting here. I can try
[26:56.870 --> 27:00.770]  to contact the people that currently live in the house, who I have no idea who they
[27:00.770 --> 27:08.410]  are. Or I could try to steal my package back. Because I'm not... is that illegal? Is that
[27:08.410 --> 27:12.950]  a crime? If I'm stealing from myself? Oh, I think the trespassing part is a crime.
[27:13.350 --> 27:20.790]  That is true. Yeah. Trespassing. But if I took a package. Addressed to you. Addressed
[27:20.790 --> 27:25.410]  to me. Because they have no idea it's coming. If you saw someone sprint away from your front
[27:25.410 --> 27:30.290]  door with a package, and then they just turned around and yelled, it's mine. Would you be
[27:30.290 --> 27:35.650]  like, oh, okay. That's very suspicious. No, I see what you're saying. This is a weird
[27:35.650 --> 27:40.750]  situation. I had a similar thing the other day where I had some dog food delivered. And
[27:40.750 --> 27:45.370]  for whatever reason, the mailman came up to my door and he said, Hey man, I took your
[27:46.350 --> 27:50.970]  dog food to the neighbors. Sorry. You can just go get it from them. And it's like a big ass
[27:50.970 --> 27:55.450]  bag of dog food, like probably 40 pounds or something. And so I walked over there and I
[27:55.450 --> 27:58.210]  was picking it up to bring it home. And I realized they have a ring camera. And I'm like,
[27:58.210 --> 28:01.590]  my neighbors think I'm stealing from them. Then I was like, what do I do? So I stop and
[28:01.590 --> 28:05.230]  I look at the ring camera and I addressed it. And I said, Hello, I don't know if you can hear me.
[28:05.570 --> 28:10.470]  It's your neighbor. And then I like picked up the package. And then I put the address and the name
[28:10.470 --> 28:14.530]  in front of the camera. And then I thought I better hold it for a while in case it's wobbly.
[28:15.570 --> 28:21.450]  And then I realized I had just been performing in front of their camera for like 45 seconds.
[28:21.510 --> 28:25.770]  And I probably look like a lunatic. And if they hadn't called the cops on me for stealing a package,
[28:25.770 --> 28:28.890]  they definitely would for whatever nonsense they thought I was performing in front of them.
[28:29.090 --> 28:31.990]  I bet they were watching the footage like with the with the sound off. And they're like,
[28:32.070 --> 28:36.350]  oh, he's taking he's taking a pack. He's he's using the package to block the camera's view
[28:36.350 --> 28:43.550]  of his face. Now he's leaving. So allegedly, you decided to steal your package from you
[28:43.550 --> 28:49.050]  from past you. Well, because honestly, what you just described, I'd rather die than have that
[28:49.050 --> 28:53.130]  whole situation. And or like the fact that I don't know, the idea of stealing the package
[28:53.130 --> 28:57.570]  seemed easier than talking to the people that live there and explaining that I bought a bunch of
[28:57.570 --> 29:02.070]  Rocky II trading cards from Australia. It'll let me know if they show up.
[29:02.230 --> 29:04.890]  Were you just in the shrubs with binoculars waiting for the mail?
[29:05.310 --> 29:09.310]  It's worse. Gavin, I am not an amateur. Okay, this is probably I looked at this as like,
[29:09.390 --> 29:13.450]  this is might be the only real heist I get the plan in my life,
[29:13.810 --> 29:18.570]  because I lived there. So I knew where all the blind spots were. So step one,
[29:19.110 --> 29:24.570]  step one, phase one is what Geoff said. If you just show up, that looks very suspicious,
[29:24.830 --> 29:29.010]  show up someone's door and look at a package. So I went to a Chinese restaurant the day before,
[29:29.370 --> 29:32.930]  grabbed as many takeout menus as I could, because if they caught me,
[29:33.270 --> 29:37.590]  the prep phase, you got to have a prep face. If it's a plane, you got to have a prep face.
[29:38.250 --> 29:44.050]  If they caught me, I wasn't a guy taking a package. I was just Chinese food delivery person
[29:44.050 --> 29:47.970]  leaving menus. I don't know if they do that. That's probably not something they do. But my head,
[29:47.970 --> 29:52.470]  that makes sense. That's like an advertisement. I was leaving advertisements for this restaurant.
[29:52.730 --> 29:59.770]  That was phase one. Then I kind of figured out where to park the car. And I enlisted my mom
[29:59.770 --> 30:04.510]  as a getaway driver because I needed someone who I could trust. Was she aware of the criminal
[30:04.510 --> 30:09.810]  activity that she was participating in? Like I explained the situation and she gave no fuck.
[30:09.890 --> 30:14.650]  She was just like, whatever. You're an idiot. Sure. I'll drive you here. I have got to meet
[30:14.650 --> 30:21.030]  your mom someday. She's very lovely. She's not sounds very patient. Extremely patient.
[30:21.310 --> 30:24.990]  Gavin also won't let me meet his mom. We should do a podcast. It's just our three moms talking.
[30:27.790 --> 30:30.650]  Talking about their ultimate face was giving birth to us.
[30:31.430 --> 30:34.190]  What's disappointing about your son today? Well, let me tell you.
[30:35.830 --> 30:40.410]  Okay. So your mom's your getaway driver. She's now an accomplice. She's going to go down for this.
[30:40.570 --> 30:43.850]  I know she won't talk. I can, I can rely on that. I feel pretty good about that.
[30:43.850 --> 30:50.030]  So we parked the car. I get out, I leave the door open because I'm planning on just like going quick.
[30:50.590 --> 30:56.690]  Also, I should mention that whenever there wasn't a post, like we didn't have a mailbox when I lived
[30:56.690 --> 31:01.430]  there. So everything they would leave at the front door, or typically the Canada post doesn't even
[31:01.430 --> 31:06.270]  deliver the package. They'll leave you a card that you take to the post office to grab your own
[31:06.270 --> 31:12.710]  package. So I was assuming I'd find a card there. So I get out the car, I tiptoe, I do my moves.
[31:12.710 --> 31:18.690]  It's very intense. This is an exhilarating, I don't know, 10 feet that I walk. I get to the
[31:18.690 --> 31:23.390]  front of the house. I panic. I decide I don't want to go back the way I come. I came. So I start
[31:23.390 --> 31:28.470]  doing like hand signals to try to get my mom to loop the car around, get in the block a little
[31:28.470 --> 31:34.910]  bit. But she has no concept of what I'm trying to try to relay to her. It was a mess. So I'm just
[31:34.910 --> 31:40.350]  throwing hand signals for like 30 seconds. She eventually gets it. Being a reasonable person,
[31:40.350 --> 31:46.150]  she refuses to drive with the car door open. So she gets out of her side, closes the door.
[31:46.310 --> 31:51.910]  And I'm freaking out about every noise. Loud car door slam, walks to my side, closes my door.
[31:52.130 --> 31:58.830]  Another slam. She hit the sounds. It could blow my cover. I'm deep Gavin at this point. I'm in the
[31:58.830 --> 32:07.290]  heart of this move. I'm coming. I'm near the door. So she closes all the doors. She drives down the
[32:07.290 --> 32:13.110]  block. I get to the front door and there's nothing there. I remember there's a mail slot
[32:13.110 --> 32:16.370]  into the door. So if they had one of those little paper things, they would have put it in there.
[32:16.590 --> 32:22.550]  And I was too scared to look. Knock on the door and say, hi, I used to live here.
[32:22.750 --> 32:27.050]  That's a failed heist at that point. Do you have any baseball cards for me?
[32:29.530 --> 32:34.930]  Then I left. That was my heist. But it was exhilarating. I almost honestly,
[32:34.930 --> 32:39.250]  I considered it as a hobby. It was a lot of fun. There was a point where I thought,
[32:39.410 --> 32:43.130]  what if I just purposely mail things to other addresses near me and then try to
[32:43.130 --> 32:47.010]  retrieve them without getting caught? It's exhilarating. Meanwhile, the local
[32:47.010 --> 32:52.090]  Chinese food restaurant is getting takeout requests through the roof. Business is booming.
[32:53.530 --> 32:57.650]  Can't figure it out. Or the cops come by and they're like, we told you last time,
[32:57.730 --> 33:04.810]  stop passing out flyers in the neighborhood. That's illegal. No unsolicited flyers. And
[33:04.810 --> 33:12.510]  I have no idea how I got there. So what happened with the cards then? Did it ever get returned?
[33:13.130 --> 33:18.390]  Did you never get your Rocky II cards? I never. So I got eventually an email saying
[33:18.390 --> 33:22.910]  that it had been delivered. And then I got another email about two weeks later saying,
[33:23.050 --> 33:28.610]  hey, if you don't grab this in like a week, we're going to send it back. And when I contacted the
[33:28.610 --> 33:32.930]  Australian store, they said, if it gets sent back, we'll just send it to you. No problem.
[33:32.930 --> 33:37.490]  Send it back. I thought, okay, that's not the worst case scenario. So they never claimed it. I
[33:37.490 --> 33:42.710]  never talked to the people that live there. I get the email it's going back. But then in the email
[33:42.710 --> 33:47.190]  for it going back, it says that the place is going to Australia. The company would have to like show
[33:47.190 --> 33:53.190]  an ID and collect it. So I thought, that's not good. So I reached out to the Australian post
[33:53.190 --> 34:01.490]  via Twitter. And we started a beautiful friendship. I said like, how can I... I confirmed that I would
[34:01.490 --> 34:06.990]  need to be there with an ID and it wouldn't even be me. So even if I decided to travel to Australia
[34:06.990 --> 34:12.370]  to get my Rocky II cards, I could not get them. It would have to be someone that represented the
[34:12.370 --> 34:20.310]  store that sent them. Would have to collect them. So once I found that out, I offered a bribe. I
[34:20.310 --> 34:23.650]  said, what if I mailed you guys like really nice chocolates? Would you just send them to me?
[34:24.770 --> 34:29.370]  And it turned into this whole exchange where that first one was a joke. I was like, I'm not
[34:29.370 --> 34:33.490]  going to send bullshit chocolate. I will send really nice chocolates if you guys somehow get
[34:33.490 --> 34:38.250]  this to me. And I was like, I won't even... they won't... you're white. No bullshit white chocolate.
[34:38.690 --> 34:42.890]  And then there was like this whole exchange of like, is white chocolate even chocolate? Which
[34:42.890 --> 34:46.610]  I guess it isn't. I thought they were slamming white chocolate as a chocolate. I guess white
[34:46.610 --> 34:51.830]  chocolate technically isn't chocolate. Wait, what is it? I have no idea, but it's not chocolate.
[34:52.610 --> 34:58.330]  I'll tell you a funny white chocolate story after this. I don't know what it is. But then like some
[34:58.330 --> 35:01.670]  other guy in their office was like, hey, I like white chocolate. And I was like, that guy's an
[35:01.670 --> 35:06.070]  asshole. Nobody likes Tom, right? Because he likes white chocolate. The whole office ganged up on
[35:06.070 --> 35:12.110]  this one guy for liking white chocolate. And I had this whole exchange with them. And I eventually
[35:12.110 --> 35:17.050]  actually emailed them like a nice box of chocolates. It took hours to get their address.
[35:18.250 --> 35:24.610]  And embarrassingly for them, it never got to them. They were unable to give me a clear address
[35:24.610 --> 35:29.590]  to get to themselves. The Australian Post failed at mailing something to them.
[35:29.730 --> 35:32.130]  You didn't accidentally send them to that old house again, did you?
[35:32.270 --> 35:39.470]  No, I did not. Double check that. Yeah, they're terrible. They couldn't deliver a package to
[35:39.470 --> 35:46.010]  themselves. So somewhere is an entire box of autographed fucking Carl Weathers,
[35:47.330 --> 35:53.870]  Rocky II cards. Yeah, they're probably with the buried ET Atari cartridges at this point.
[35:53.870 --> 35:58.890]  Oh, man. Somebody out there has it in for you in the Postal Service, somewhere in the global
[35:58.890 --> 36:04.750]  Postal Service and is just fucking getting sticky chocolate hands all over your Rocky cards right
[36:04.750 --> 36:08.670]  now and laughing, laughing, laughing. So how much money have you pissed away
[36:08.670 --> 36:11.230]  on these cards and now the chocolate? About $45.
[36:13.290 --> 36:17.890]  Chocolates were about the same price. They're old Rocky cards. They're not valuable at all.
[36:18.130 --> 36:21.730]  I don't know how the mail works, though. Like, I get anxiety about mailing anything.
[36:22.290 --> 36:28.290]  I don't know how the mail works. How does it? No, I'm not. Okay, before I get made fun of here,
[36:28.670 --> 36:33.490]  it's fucking wild that you could just put an address on somewhere and then send it to, like,
[36:33.510 --> 36:38.370]  a different country and it just shows up. How many hands that must exchange? You still have to
[36:38.370 --> 36:42.290]  wrap it. You can't write an address on a shoe and just put it in the mailbox. You still have to,
[36:42.310 --> 36:46.830]  like, do some work. Well, you're talking about, though, like, the outer appearance of it. Like,
[36:47.550 --> 36:51.490]  mail a letter. You're just blown away in general about how you just leave
[36:51.490 --> 36:56.250]  something in a box and then it ends up on another continent. Yeah. Like, if I wanted to mail,
[36:56.470 --> 37:02.950]  I don't know, a fucking banana to Australia, I could. And how much, like, how far it would travel
[37:02.950 --> 37:08.110]  and how much work would have to get done for that to happen. It just blows my mind. I wonder what
[37:08.110 --> 37:13.470]  they would take if it just had an address on it. Like, could you write in pen on a banana
[37:13.930 --> 37:18.610]  an address with the correct postage attached? Would they just send the banana? Yeah. Maybe
[37:18.610 --> 37:23.770]  not a banana, but there was a thing on the Internet a few years ago where, like, before
[37:23.770 --> 37:29.310]  YouTube and shit, somebody did, like, a picture story, you know, like, on an old blog where they
[37:29.310 --> 37:34.370]  tried to send, like, wackier, wacky stuff through the post office. Like, can you send a two by four?
[37:34.790 --> 37:39.250]  Can you send a coconut? A lot of shit you can. I think they were able to send a brick,
[37:39.590 --> 37:45.530]  just with, like, the address taped to it. My paranoia for, like, the address stuff,
[37:45.530 --> 37:50.790]  like, I wasn't confident that I even knew my address here, so I shipped a package to myself
[37:50.790 --> 37:54.350]  that I didn't really need. I just shipped one to confirm that this is where I live.
[37:54.470 --> 37:58.790]  You're just testing out the mail route. Yeah, I wanted to make sure that if I sent the package,
[37:58.990 --> 38:04.030]  it would get to my address. It confuses me. The mail system seems very complicated.
[38:04.410 --> 38:08.670]  One time I was at the mall. This is my white chocolate story. One time I was at the mall,
[38:09.870 --> 38:14.470]  and this is during my first marriage, so I hadn't fucked up my first marriage yet,
[38:14.470 --> 38:17.330]  and then started and fucked up my second marriage. So this is way, way back.
[38:17.750 --> 38:22.710]  This is in the process of fucking up my first marriage. And I went to the mall in Austin to
[38:22.710 --> 38:27.470]  get, like, some chocolates or something for my first wife, and it's just like a gift. It was,
[38:27.610 --> 38:31.350]  honestly, who can remember? It was a hundred years ago. It was probably an apology, if I'm being
[38:31.350 --> 38:36.630]  honest. And I went to this little chocolatier stand in the middle of the mall, and there was a
[38:36.630 --> 38:40.930]  nice girl working there, probably, you know, in her early 20s. And she was just really chatty,
[38:40.990 --> 38:44.110]  so I was just kind of chatting with her. And I was like, yeah, I'm picking out some chocolates
[38:44.110 --> 38:48.270]  for my wife or whatever. And she goes, well, do you know what she likes? And I was like,
[38:48.410 --> 38:52.370]  I think she likes white chocolate. I don't remember. I think she did. It's been so long ago.
[38:53.030 --> 38:56.930]  And the girl goes, why? We have some really good white chocolates. Although, you know what?
[38:58.610 --> 39:02.930]  I gotta be honest with you. It's not real chocolate. And I go, excuse me? She goes,
[39:03.030 --> 39:07.690]  it's a big secret. Not everybody knows it, but yeah, white chocolate's not actually chocolate.
[39:07.850 --> 39:11.450]  I don't know. And she explained the reason to me. I don't remember now because it's not important.
[39:11.830 --> 39:16.110]  What is important, though, is she's doing this whole list. And then I'm like, okay. And then
[39:16.110 --> 39:20.130]  she goes, yeah, white chocolate's my boyfriend's favorite, too. He loves it. He can't get enough
[39:20.130 --> 39:24.970]  of the stuff. And I said, well, you should save the white chocolate's not really chocolate story
[39:24.970 --> 39:30.770]  for when you guys break up. And she goes... Her face just fell. And she goes, why would you say
[39:30.770 --> 39:34.310]  that? And I go, what would I say what? And she goes, do you think my boyfriend and I are going
[39:34.310 --> 39:38.130]  to break up? And I go, I don't know. And she goes, do you know my boyfriend? And I was like,
[39:38.130 --> 39:41.630]  no, I don't know either of you. I just, I don't know anything about you. And she goes,
[39:42.050 --> 39:46.430]  why would you say my boyfriend and I are going to break up? And I go, I don't know that you're
[39:46.430 --> 39:49.810]  going to break up. I'm just saying if you ever do, hit him with the white chocolate's not real
[39:49.810 --> 39:54.010]  chocolate and rock his world. And she goes, I just, I don't, I don't know why you would say
[39:54.010 --> 40:00.030]  that. And she just like turned away. And I was like, I guess I'm leaving now. That was fucking
[40:00.030 --> 40:04.950]  brutal. I felt so bad afterward. I was like, man, I really ruined that lady's day. And I did not
[40:04.950 --> 40:12.730]  mean to. I was just, I was just making a joke. I feel like in your early life, it was always a
[40:12.730 --> 40:17.950]  risk when you would interact with normal people, just like regular humans, regular job, living
[40:17.950 --> 40:25.490]  their lives. Yeah. Making some enemies here and there. I, uh, I used to be pretty bad about it.
[40:25.630 --> 40:30.610]  I remember in high school, my last, uh, one of my worst jobs in high school, I was a dishwasher
[40:30.610 --> 40:36.850]  and I washed dishes for like the way the hierarchy at the fried chicken, the local fried chicken
[40:36.850 --> 40:42.650]  fast food restaurant I worked at worked in Alabama was you started in the dishes and then you made
[40:42.650 --> 40:46.850]  your way up to cook. And then you made your way up to front counter. And that's where you got like
[40:46.850 --> 40:52.330]  an extra 25 cents or something. And you didn't have to get fucking covered in grease and, and
[40:52.330 --> 40:56.350]  like have your hands stripped with cleaner and all that stuff. You just had to sell biscuits and
[40:56.350 --> 41:00.970]  chicken to people. And I worked there for a year and a half and I demand, I was like, when do I,
[41:01.090 --> 41:05.270]  like I had, I had brought in buddies be like, come get a job at this place. And they got promoted
[41:05.270 --> 41:09.050]  past me pretty quickly to the point where like all my friends worked at the place that I worked,
[41:09.130 --> 41:13.510]  but they were, I got them all jobs, but they all were higher paid and in better positions than me.
[41:14.190 --> 41:17.970]  And I finally went to the manager and I said, I want to, I want the front. You got to like,
[41:18.210 --> 41:21.430]  come on, man. I've been washing dishes for my entire life here. Let me, let me take a crack
[41:21.430 --> 41:25.610]  at the front counter. And they let me work the front counter for two weeks and they pulled me
[41:25.610 --> 41:31.910]  in and they said, we're putting you back on dishes. And I go, why did I, did I screw up
[41:31.910 --> 41:36.730]  the till or something? He goes, no, no, you got all the money stuff. Right. But, uh, I don't know
[41:36.730 --> 41:39.410]  how to say this. So I'm just going to be honest with you, Geoff. This guy's name was Keith, by the
[41:39.410 --> 41:46.010]  way. He's a real dipshit. But, uh, he was like, uh, he goes, uh, he's sitting in this fucking
[41:46.470 --> 41:51.170]  like lazy, like this roller chair that leans back. That was half broken looking at me.
[41:51.170 --> 41:56.730]  Like he's like the godfather, some 38 year old dude managing 16 year olds at a fast food
[41:56.730 --> 42:02.310]  restaurant. And he goes, uh, well, the thing about it is, and you need to hear this. You need to hear
[42:02.310 --> 42:06.990]  this for your life. Uh, you make people uncomfortable. And I go, what do you mean?
[42:07.250 --> 42:11.430]  And he goes, customers don't like you. They complain about you constantly. They say you
[42:11.430 --> 42:16.110]  make them uncomfortable. They, uh, they don't, they, uh, you just, you weird them out. And I go,
[42:16.210 --> 42:20.490]  I just make jokes and stuff with them. And he goes, yeah, yeah, that's part of it. Uh,
[42:20.490 --> 42:28.630]  we don't get your jokes. It's like, okay. And did any of these interactions ever register as like,
[42:28.690 --> 42:32.250]  Ooh, they're not going to be happy with that. Or would they, you just like constantly completely
[42:32.250 --> 42:40.210]  oblivious. I would get in fights with people all the time. Is there any like thought I'm just going
[42:40.210 --> 42:44.630]  to follow like the, like, what do you want? Like, I don't think I've had a memorable conversation
[42:44.630 --> 42:49.530]  at a fast food place my entire life. The concept that you're constantly getting in fights. I don't
[42:49.530 --> 42:54.430]  know how you get to a point where you could start a fight. Well, here's the thing I had,
[42:54.490 --> 42:58.530]  I didn't have as much of a filter when I was a kid and I was way more sarcastic than I am now.
[42:59.050 --> 43:04.710]  And so the sarcasm was, was the first problem, but also I just, you know, especially when I was
[43:04.710 --> 43:10.470]  a kid, I just wanted to make myself laugh constantly. And so, uh, I would do it at their
[43:10.470 --> 43:14.410]  expense a lot. So I would make a lot, you know, I would just like the, the customers would make
[43:14.410 --> 43:18.530]  me laugh. They would like piss me off or do something dumb. And I would, uh, I would,
[43:19.410 --> 43:23.470]  I would make them uncomfortable, making fun of them. And so, uh, because of that,
[43:23.550 --> 43:26.870]  I got to wash a lot more dishes and I never got to do the front counter again.
[43:27.090 --> 43:30.090]  Even if somebody called in sick, they wouldn't put me on the front counter.
[43:30.310 --> 43:34.330]  That's impressive. Like, cause you think like, how long does an order take? 15, 20 seconds?
[43:34.750 --> 43:37.990]  There's not a lot of time to offend someone. Like, unless you're opening with like,
[43:38.030 --> 43:40.430]  Hey dipshit, what do you want? That's a good point. That's actually,
[43:40.430 --> 43:44.550]  it's impressive to make someone uncomfortable that immediately after meeting them.
[43:44.670 --> 43:50.850]  I was a prick, man. It was a lot of, you know, I was not, I'm not going to defend it and I'm not
[43:50.850 --> 43:54.570]  going to say any of the things I probably would have said, but I was just, I was an obnoxious kid.
[43:55.830 --> 44:00.310]  It's just the fact that you also, that we're clueless about it, that like you could aggravate
[44:00.310 --> 44:04.390]  somebody within a 15 second window and then also be pulled and be like, what's up? Like, why,
[44:04.490 --> 44:06.670]  why are we having this talk? What are you saying?
[44:06.670 --> 44:10.450]  Why would I be like, they'd be like, well, like this guy had this issue with you and I go, Oh,
[44:10.470 --> 44:13.050]  that was hilarious. We had a, we had a funny joke about that. And they'd be like, no,
[44:13.130 --> 44:16.110]  you had a funny joke about that. He was mad. He wanted to punch you in the face.
[44:19.870 --> 44:24.750]  And that's when I knew, uh, I knew that day that Keith didn't have a lot of faith in my future
[44:24.750 --> 44:30.430]  at the fried chicken restaurant. But here's the thing. You also, you then went on, I assume a lot
[44:30.430 --> 44:35.050]  later to work in a call center and you actually were like quite good at your job by the sounds
[44:35.050 --> 44:39.270]  of it and had you got to management and all that stuff, but were you not a sarcastic prick
[44:39.270 --> 44:45.270]  to people down the phone? Well, so the difference between when I was 23 and I got a job at the call
[44:45.270 --> 44:50.310]  center and when I was 16 and working at the fast food restaurant was five years of the army. Oh,
[44:50.470 --> 44:56.070]  okay. Yeah. So, uh, the army beat a lot of like physically beat a lot of sarcasm out of me
[44:57.630 --> 45:01.910]  and, uh, calmed me down quite a bit. So, uh, I learned how to handle it
[45:02.530 --> 45:07.630]  so that I could, I could, uh, at least pay the rent. Let me say that. And, uh, you know,
[45:07.750 --> 45:12.910]  by the time I was 23, I had a wife and a mortgage and I couldn't afford to be a dick to customers.
[45:13.010 --> 45:18.530]  I wonder how post-army Geoff would have gotten on with pre-army Geoff.
[45:18.810 --> 45:21.350]  Not well. Would you have complained to the manager about yourself?
[45:23.530 --> 45:27.770]  I don't think so, but maybe today Geoff would though. Today, Geoff would have
[45:28.650 --> 45:33.890]  zero patience for like 17 year old Geoff or 18 year old Geoff. I would not, I'd, I'd see him coming
[45:33.890 --> 45:36.950]  out and be like, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing all of them. Fucking. I don't care if it's me. I
[45:36.950 --> 45:41.810]  don't care about, I don't care. I'm me. I can't deal with me. It's too much. He was, he was a
[45:41.810 --> 45:47.190]  prick. All right. So it's, it's time. This is the part. This is the part that we get. We nail it.
[45:47.330 --> 45:52.390]  Every episode I'm learning is the outro. So here we go. We got some cuts, some,
[45:52.470 --> 45:56.710]  some gentle coaching from Eric. It's time to end the podcast. We're going to do it smoothly.
[45:57.250 --> 46:04.570]  This has been F*** Face, a F*** Face production. I am, I have been your F*** Facer, uh, Geoff Ramsey
[46:04.570 --> 46:08.650]  with me as always, uh, Gavin Free and Andrew Payton. That sounds like the beginning of F*** Face.
[46:08.810 --> 46:13.150]  No, just end it! You didn't tell us to say any of that! Why did I say all that stuff? You didn't
[46:13.150 --> 46:16.910]  tell us to! Did you end the turnip market this week? Oh my God. Oh, I took the day off of turnips.
[46:16.970 --> 46:21.630]  I took that week off turnips and my fucking girlfriend's sister has $3.59 today. Dude,
[46:21.710 --> 46:26.590]  mine went wrong. Apparently white, white chocolate is not a chocolate. I'm late for
[46:26.590 --> 46:31.990]  a meeting now. White chocolate doesn't contain, it doesn't contain Coke. It doesn't contain
[46:31.990 --> 46:37.070]  chocolate solids. That's why it's not chocolate. But keep it to yourself because you'll break up
[46:37.070 --> 46:40.790]  relationships. It's not good. You'll end friendships. White chocolate's not something
[46:40.790 --> 46:46.090]  to fuck around with. Uh, also, uh, shout out to white chocolate. One of the best pastors in the
[46:46.090 --> 46:52.830]  history of the NBA. Yeah. Oh, Hey, if you like this podcast, do a review thing. Uh, Eric said
[46:52.830 --> 46:57.290]  that people, everybody should review it and review all of the faces that they did in their
[46:57.290 --> 47:03.950]  life or something and give six stars out of five and, uh, tell all of your friends and enemies and
[47:03.950 --> 47:10.870]  teachers and people that you run. If you ever have a bad experience at a fight at a fast food
[47:10.870 --> 47:16.670]  restaurant, tell them about face. Follow Eric on Twitter. No, you don't have to do it here. Hang on
[47:16.670 --> 47:21.610]  just a second. Did you just end the recording? Hey guys, if you could, if you give me two seconds,
[47:21.610 --> 47:26.470]  I'm just wrapping up this other podcast. Um, so I'll be in this meeting in two seconds. I'm just
[47:26.470 --> 47:31.690]  letting you know. I just wanted to jump right in. Okay. There you go. So very late for this meeting.
[47:31.810 --> 47:38.270]  Thanks guys. All right. See you guys next week. Oh, if you go to church, tell, tell God, whatever
[47:38.270 --> 47:43.410]  your God is. If it's any of them, just tell your God about face. We really want to get him involved
[47:43.410 --> 47:47.950]  or her. Uh, maybe there'll be a guest someday. Uh, we can talk about all the terrible things
[47:47.950 --> 47:52.510]  they've done to me, uh, in my life. And, uh, and then the end really start at the top of your
[47:52.510 --> 47:59.970]  beard. Is it a new beard or a continuation of the old beard guys? Is it a new beard? Guys,
[48:00.190 --> 48:03.770]  if you shave your beard, it's a new beard or it's a new beard. What do you think, Eric?
[48:04.250 --> 48:10.630]  Thanks for listening. Goodbye. Bye Eric. Hi Eric. Man. Now that Eric's gone, you want to keep going?
[48:11.310 --> 48:12.290]  Yeah. What do you guys want to talk about?
