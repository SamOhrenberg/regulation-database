[00:40.380 --> 00:43.740]  Hello and welcome to another episode. Why are you laughing?
[00:44.280 --> 00:47.780]  I just collapsed right as you started. Sorry, go again.
[00:49.780 --> 00:53.200]  I hate you. I hate this part. I hate the start and I hate the end.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.580]  It's very not you.
[00:57.100 --> 00:58.480]  I know, I know.
[01:00.400 --> 01:07.540]  All right, well, we already started. But anyway, this is episode four of the F***face Podcast. My
[01:07.540 --> 01:13.820]  host along with Gavin Free and Andrew Panton, two of the f***iest faces I have ever met.
[01:13.900 --> 01:14.520]  How's it going, guys?
[01:14.700 --> 01:15.080]  It's true.
[01:15.340 --> 01:15.600]  Good, man.
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.000]  Pretty good. I have some updates. I have a basket weaving update.
[01:19.560 --> 01:21.760]  Oh, you hit us up with the basket weaving update.
[01:22.680 --> 01:26.840]  Well, first, I mean, to answer the question, we're talking who the LeBron James is,
[01:27.060 --> 01:32.220]  the basket weaving. I have been informed it is apparently Leona Waddell is our LeBron James.
[01:32.340 --> 01:32.940]  Where's she from?
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.320]  Ah, it's a great question, Gavin. You know, I should have done a little bit of research. I
[01:37.320 --> 01:43.140]  just looked at her baskets. You really, you exposed me one second in. I should have considered
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.900]  doing like a little bit of prep. I really came in like I was knowledgeable and you asked one
[01:48.900 --> 01:51.280]  question and the entire trade fell apart.
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.140]  Well, let me ask you a question you're better suited to.
[01:54.320 --> 01:54.800]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:54.820 --> 01:56.060]  How are her baskets?
[01:56.580 --> 02:03.040]  They are really visually impressive. Clearly a basket weaving expert, I can tell you. They
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.540]  are of the highest quality. I kind of got this since she's like the LeBron James, maybe not
[02:07.540 --> 02:10.620]  necessarily Michael Jordan. It sounds like there are people obviously in the past that were
[02:10.620 --> 02:13.100]  incredibly skilled, but pretty good.
[02:13.320 --> 02:17.000]  But they got into weaving other things, do you think? Got bored of baskets?
[02:17.500 --> 02:20.780]  That's it. Yeah. Another great question. I don't know.
[02:21.040 --> 02:27.420]  I have a question. You looked up her weaving skill. How much do her baskets cost? If she's
[02:27.420 --> 02:36.280]  the LeBron James of baskets, is she like the Damien Hirst of baskets? Is it like a million
[02:36.280 --> 02:39.120]  dollars to get one of her wicker baskets or chairs?
[02:39.460 --> 02:44.780]  Once again, being pretty exposed for my lack of information, my lack of research. I watched like
[02:44.780 --> 02:48.460]  six videos and looked at photos. I mainly was watching the videos to make sure I got
[02:48.460 --> 02:49.500]  the pronunciation right.
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.180]  I mean, everyone knows that baskets get more valuable after the weaver dies.
[02:54.180 --> 02:59.000]  That's yeah, very true. I will say she said when she started, she was only selling them
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.840]  for 69 cents. So above 69 cents is what I can't say. I get the sense they're very expensive.
[03:05.180 --> 03:05.860]  It's got to be profit.
[03:06.100 --> 03:10.080]  Do you have any idea how much experience this lady has in basket weaving? How long she's
[03:10.080 --> 03:10.620]  been doing it?
[03:10.780 --> 03:16.080]  Once again, did zero research beyond looking at the baskets, but she is very talented.
[03:17.940 --> 03:21.280]  I really should have. You know, I guess when you bring up something like that,
[03:21.300 --> 03:23.740]  you should anticipate like basic questions being asked.
[03:23.740 --> 03:25.780]  It's kind of an empty update, to be honest, Andrew.
[03:25.820 --> 03:29.480]  No, I'm not done with the update. That was the first, this phase one of the update. I
[03:29.480 --> 03:34.940]  just wanted to clarify that that's who that was. The second update is someone reached
[03:34.940 --> 03:39.440]  out to me who does this for a living. They make baskets or they teach people how to basket
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.040]  weave a certain type and they're going to mail me a kit and I am going to join the basket
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.480]  weaving alliance. I know this is shocking, but I'm going to weave a basket.
[03:50.560 --> 03:55.080]  I have no idea how I watched a video, but I'm going to get the stuff. I don't know how
[03:55.080 --> 03:56.940]  to get it to me because the office is closed.
[03:57.400 --> 04:00.180]  That's awesome. We could auction it off for charity.
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.400]  Oh, no, you can't.
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.860]  I'm kidding. Are you doing this to prove that basket weaving is not difficult and that you
[04:08.860 --> 04:14.060]  can be good at it easily? Or are you doing it to, like, relent and accede that basket
[04:14.060 --> 04:21.040]  weaving is a difficult and artistic endeavor and you're going to give props and respect
[04:21.420 --> 04:23.120]  by doing it and showing how hard it is?
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.400]  Yeah, I think it's a little bit of column A, column B. It'll probably be really difficult,
[04:27.620 --> 04:31.600]  but if I was in the basket weaving community and I fucking nail it out of the gate, I'd be a
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.740]  little bit worried. It's a possibility. I could hit a home run here and not even know what I'm
[04:35.740 --> 04:41.260]  doing. I'm bad at knots, so this is not up my alley in any way. I have no natural artistic talent,
[04:41.260 --> 04:46.240]  but if I fucking home run this thing, that's a bad look for the basket weaving community.
[04:46.400 --> 04:48.120]  They got a lot to lose and I got a lot to gain.
[04:48.500 --> 04:53.600]  That's a really excellent, salient point there. If I were a basket weaver, I'd be on pins and
[04:53.600 --> 04:58.920]  needles for the next... how long? I don't even know. A month, maybe? Until you unleash your
[04:58.920 --> 05:00.160]  basket upon the world?
[05:00.580 --> 05:04.560]  It might be months and it might not be a basket. We'll see how it goes.
[05:04.940 --> 05:06.220]  It might change into something else.
[05:06.740 --> 05:11.200]  You know what we should do? How about you get good at this and you weave a bathtub
[05:11.200 --> 05:17.200]  and then we two use that bathtub to compete in your shitty bathtub town race.
[05:17.660 --> 05:20.220]  You know, I don't... I love the idea.
[05:20.600 --> 05:24.220]  There's actually already a name for a wicker bathtub.
[05:24.940 --> 05:25.200]  Yeah?
[05:25.480 --> 05:32.420]  A basket. It doesn't make it a bathtub if you make it the shape... it's still just a big basket.
[05:34.180 --> 05:35.200]  Is that true?
[05:35.200 --> 05:38.500]  Well, what if we put wax on it to seal it?
[05:38.740 --> 05:40.580]  Yeah, if you seal it, then it becomes a bathtub.
[05:40.940 --> 05:44.220]  Yeah, and if it's the size... if it holds all three of us and it's the size of a bathtub...
[05:44.220 --> 05:46.060]  That's a big tub. I don't know about that.
[05:48.560 --> 05:49.860]  Sure. Let's do it.
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.840]  All right. I'm looking forward to it, Andrew. I can't wait to see your bathtub.
[05:54.980 --> 06:00.540]  It's gonna be bad. I'm not... I have zero natural artistic ability. I had to draw,
[06:00.680 --> 06:04.220]  like, a trumpet in art class and everyone thought it was a shopping cart. Like,
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.560]  I got bad hands. I'm not good at knots.
[06:07.180 --> 06:10.000]  A trumpet that looked like a shopping cart?
[06:10.140 --> 06:13.900]  I was trying to, like, do the part with the bottom where you pull. I also... I took trumpet
[06:13.900 --> 06:18.400]  because I thought all you had to do was hit three buttons and it's a lot harder than three buttons.
[06:18.560 --> 06:23.840]  I thought it was gonna be really easy. That didn't go well. Yeah, no, I'm no artist. I'm
[06:23.840 --> 06:29.180]  bad at knots. I had a boat safety class in school and I didn't do well.
[06:29.400 --> 06:32.780]  Is that something that you learn on your Canadian island? Do you have to learn about
[06:33.840 --> 06:39.120]  nautical stuff because you're on an island? I don't know. It's a weird thing where I don't
[06:39.120 --> 06:43.020]  know anyone else who had mandatory boat safety. And I live on a huge island. It's not like it's
[06:43.020 --> 06:49.320]  small. But yeah, we had, like, 10 mandatory boat safety classes. And I was really... I'm like,
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.080]  I'm gonna nail this. How long are they?
[06:51.320 --> 06:56.180]  They were an hour each. I had, like, 10 hours of boat safety. I learned a lot.
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.020]  You're the captain of the bathtub then, hands down.
[06:59.020 --> 07:03.680]  I am the cap. Yeah, clearly. I'm guessing you guys didn't have boat safety in school.
[07:04.280 --> 07:04.640]  No.
[07:04.660 --> 07:05.580]  I'm gonna make that assumption.
[07:06.140 --> 07:09.980]  So I assume that at no point have you ever needed to get off your island via boat.
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.820]  Like, there's plenty of bridges, roads.
[07:12.120 --> 07:14.380]  No, all the time. Yeah, that's how I leave is by boat.
[07:15.480 --> 07:19.400]  Do you not know, like, just to get to Austin, it's a fucking journey in itself.
[07:19.600 --> 07:21.040]  It's like a Lord of the Rings-like tale.
[07:21.300 --> 07:26.080]  I've heard about... I've heard before, like, when you went to RTX, which is the convention that our
[07:26.080 --> 07:29.900]  company puts on every year. You told me it took you, like, two and a half days to get here one year.
[07:30.420 --> 07:31.620]  What is that process like?
[07:31.860 --> 07:34.700]  Day one is getting on a boat, going to...
[07:35.040 --> 07:39.000]  Yeah, like a ferry. That's, like, two and a half hours. Then I get on a bus.
[07:39.640 --> 07:45.720]  Then I go from the bus to a SkyTrain, which is, like, a train in the sky.
[07:45.860 --> 07:48.280]  I don't know why I explained it. It's kind of self-explanatory.
[07:49.340 --> 07:51.820]  Okay, got it. I have a great mental picture now.
[07:51.940 --> 07:52.160]  Yep.
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.040]  And that's, like, a six-hour journey? Maybe a little less. Maybe, like, five?
[07:56.240 --> 07:59.540]  Probably more like five, but it's just, like, catching a flight at that point is late,
[07:59.620 --> 08:02.680]  so then I just sleep in the airport, and then I leave the next day.
[08:02.840 --> 08:03.300]  But yeah, it's like a two-day trip.
[08:03.300 --> 08:05.780]  Why don't you just take the airport from your island?
[08:06.300 --> 08:09.280]  Yeah, I don't know. You know what? Because I never have, so I haven't.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.800]  There is an airport here. I guess that would, like, really reduce...
[08:11.800 --> 08:15.220]  Because I assume it's not an island where you think, oh, I'm on an island.
[08:15.300 --> 08:17.780]  I assume it's, like, you know, how I feel when I'm in England.
[08:17.960 --> 08:21.020]  I don't think, man, I'm on an island. It's so big that you don't even know it.
[08:21.020 --> 08:25.360]  I don't know. It's, like, you see water almost everywhere, where I live, at least.
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.260]  It's big. It's not like England. You're where you're on the island.
[08:28.560 --> 08:32.500]  I did see a comment on, I want to say, episode one or two from somebody who said,
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.100]  I don't know why Andrew keeps calling this a little island. I live on it, too, and it's massive.
[08:37.640 --> 08:40.700]  It's, I don't know, massive. I don't feel like I said little island.
[08:40.800 --> 08:42.920]  I feel like when you say island, it's assumed little.
[08:44.260 --> 08:45.860]  I don't think I ever said little island.
[08:46.520 --> 08:46.840]  Okay.
[08:47.100 --> 08:50.520]  Every time I meet someone from Australia, I'm going to ask them how they're lying.
[08:53.680 --> 08:56.720]  You should look into the airport where you live.
[08:57.320 --> 08:59.420]  Just see. Just for the hell of it.
[09:00.260 --> 09:03.060]  I don't trust it. I've been there. It's small. I don't like it.
[09:03.060 --> 09:08.460]  It'll save you five, it'll save five to six hours and a day.
[09:08.920 --> 09:09.060]  Transportation.
[09:12.100 --> 09:15.920]  I trust the airport. What's funny is I had, like, ten boat safety classes,
[09:16.280 --> 09:19.180]  and the same year we learned sex ed, we only needed one of those.
[09:19.180 --> 09:23.000]  We had a 45-minute sex ed and ten classes on boat safety.
[09:23.520 --> 09:30.020]  So it takes ten hours of training to drive a dinghy, but to drive your dinghy, an hour max.
[09:33.700 --> 09:36.240]  What, hit us with some boat safety knowledge.
[09:36.500 --> 09:41.040]  Like, distill your ten hours down into one or two things Gavin and I must know
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.400]  before we get into the bathtub with you.
[09:42.440 --> 09:45.920]  Must know. Okay. You know, honestly, the only thing that stuck with me was
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.620]  the heat points of the body if you crash during the water.
[09:49.940 --> 09:55.120]  I think your primary heat points is between the legs, under the arm, and under the chin.
[09:55.540 --> 09:58.420]  So you're supposed to, like, really tighten up, like, almost like a pencil,
[09:58.940 --> 10:00.380]  try to maintain your heat.
[10:00.640 --> 10:04.080]  So you want to trap the heat from under your arms and your neck.
[10:04.080 --> 10:05.220]  That may have been the sex ed class.
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.920]  That's all I remember from that time.
[10:09.980 --> 10:13.280]  Doesn't pencil position make it hard to swim away from the boat?
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.120]  What? You're just floating. The idea of the boat is gone, Geoff. The boat is sunk.
[10:19.340 --> 10:24.300]  Yeah, but if you just stand in the ocean like a pencil, you'll just go straight down.
[10:24.660 --> 10:26.840]  How would you just, you know what, honestly, you cross your arms.
[10:27.020 --> 10:29.180]  It's not really pencil, it's more like an uncross.
[10:29.580 --> 10:32.080]  Okay, so sort of floating on your back with your arms crossed, maybe.
[10:32.280 --> 10:33.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's better.
[10:33.580 --> 10:36.680]  Take a Dracula nap until somebody rescues you, essentially.
[10:37.320 --> 10:37.720]  Exactly.
[10:38.760 --> 10:40.420]  Okay, I'll remember that.
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.960]  I won't tread water, that's for sure.
[10:43.280 --> 10:44.240]  I'll just...
[10:44.240 --> 10:46.920]  No, you're gonna get tired if you do that.
[10:47.180 --> 10:48.080]  It's just wasting heat.
[10:48.540 --> 10:49.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.240]  Okay, so we're gonna be in a giant basket, I guess sealed with some sort of resin,
[10:54.620 --> 10:56.580]  and we'll know what to do when we crash.
[10:56.900 --> 10:58.020]  Candle wax, snowflakes.
[10:58.360 --> 10:59.220]  Wax, okay.
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.840]  Yeah, and then as soon as we crash, which we will, everybody assumes a vampire pencil,
[11:05.180 --> 11:07.420]  and then they'll come fish us out eventually, or we'll die.
[11:07.840 --> 11:08.600]  All right, that sounds good.
[11:08.960 --> 11:10.960]  You have to make wax, do you know how you do it?
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.500]  Yeah, yeah, you just buy wax at the store and then just heat it up in a,
[11:15.560 --> 11:19.260]  like in a fucking pot, and then just dribble it on.
[11:19.420 --> 11:20.520]  That part won't be hard.
[11:20.700 --> 11:22.940]  Isn't it like congealed paraffin?
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.080]  Yeah, it's just paraffin.
[11:24.540 --> 11:26.420]  We just heat it up and melt it onto stuff.
[11:26.780 --> 11:28.020]  That's not gonna be the hard part, buddy.
[11:28.220 --> 11:30.700]  The basket weaving a boat is gonna be the hard part.
[11:30.860 --> 11:31.040]  Yeah.
[11:31.220 --> 11:34.920]  I just, I think, I don't know, I talked to Gavin about this before, I think a lot about
[11:35.300 --> 11:39.860]  if, let's say, a fallout situation happened, everything is gone, you're in a village,
[11:39.860 --> 11:43.460]  and someone was like, the leader was like, hey, you go make chairs,
[11:43.540 --> 11:45.380]  we don't have any chairs, you need to figure that out.
[11:45.620 --> 11:49.180]  If they pointed at me and said, what can you go make?
[11:49.240 --> 11:50.740]  I don't know if I could make anything.
[11:51.320 --> 11:52.120]  Maybe a chair.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.740]  That's why you need to get on this basket weaving shit immediately.
[11:56.400 --> 11:59.100]  I read a book in high school called Lucifer's Hammer.
[11:59.280 --> 12:02.020]  It was a sci-fi, one of those end of the world sci-fi books,
[12:02.260 --> 12:05.300]  probably written in the 70s or the 80s, so the science is dog shit.
[12:05.300 --> 12:10.180]  But the world ends, I think it was like a meteor or something,
[12:10.680 --> 12:13.400]  and the only people, they built these little towns,
[12:13.800 --> 12:16.780]  and you were only allowed in the town if you had a skill they needed.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.580]  So it's like, well, I can fix boats, but if it's like, I'm an accountant,
[12:20.780 --> 12:22.160]  they're like, get the fuck out, you're dead.
[12:22.340 --> 12:24.420]  So you need to learn that basket shit tomorrow.
[12:25.220 --> 12:26.300]  Gavin and I are fucked.
[12:26.500 --> 12:28.780]  We got no appreciable skills, but you at least have an out.
[12:28.900 --> 12:30.500]  What would you get on, Geoff?
[12:30.580 --> 12:31.280]  What would you learn?
[12:32.220 --> 12:38.360]  Well, you know, I could harken back to my days in high school as a fried chicken dishwasher.
[12:39.780 --> 12:41.820]  You fixed tools at one point.
[12:42.240 --> 12:45.520]  I was a hydraulic, electronic, and pneumatic tool repairman.
[12:45.640 --> 12:47.820]  I'm sure I still have all those skills from when I was 17.
[12:49.180 --> 12:51.060]  Oh, I was in the army. I could be a soldier.
[12:51.500 --> 12:52.660]  Oh, that's pretty useful, actually.
[12:53.440 --> 12:55.480]  Yeah. I like you went dishwasher first.
[12:55.600 --> 12:59.020]  I feel like you did those backwards as far as what would be valuable.
[13:00.340 --> 13:04.120]  I could be, I could be the creative director of, you know, whatever.
[13:05.580 --> 13:09.080]  I can make stuff slow and carry boxes of veg.
[13:09.480 --> 13:10.020]  That's true.
[13:10.300 --> 13:11.400]  Those are my two things.
[13:11.620 --> 13:15.600]  If there's a post-apocalyptic olive bar, you can keep it clean, right?
[13:16.240 --> 13:17.160]  What you did at Waitrose.
[13:17.600 --> 13:17.940]  Yeah.
[13:19.100 --> 13:20.440]  Hey, shout out to Waitrose.
[13:20.740 --> 13:22.960]  Shout out to Waitrose. They haven't sponsored us yet, but...
[13:22.960 --> 13:23.220]  No.
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.240]  If you're in England and you want a fancy olive, Kalamata, whatever, go to Waitrose.
[13:29.120 --> 13:32.040]  Can you imagine being the dishwasher guy when there isn't a plate person?
[13:32.440 --> 13:34.920]  That'd be a real problem. Like, they're gonna kick you out.
[13:35.100 --> 13:38.260]  Well, because, like, what if they don't have a guy that can make plates or whatever?
[13:38.620 --> 13:41.220]  Oh, so you're just waiting for plates to be reinvented?
[13:41.220 --> 13:42.520]  Yeah, like, they're gonna kick you off and you're like,
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.060]  listen, you got, you're gonna have a huge problem once the plate person shows up.
[13:47.280 --> 13:50.660]  You guys are all screwed. This is over. You're gonna need me.
[13:50.880 --> 13:53.900]  It's like in the video game Overcooked when you're standing by the dishes,
[13:54.120 --> 13:57.260]  just waiting for, like, where's the dirty plates? I can't do my job.
[13:58.060 --> 14:01.280]  Yeah, you really want a job that's, like, the beginning of the chain.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.980]  You don't want to be waiting on other people.
[14:03.380 --> 14:05.600]  Definitely. Court jester. We could all do that, right?
[14:05.640 --> 14:06.440]  We're funny. Oh.
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.380]  Except the problem with the jester is you have to taste food to make sure it's not poison.
[14:10.680 --> 14:12.220]  Hmm. Like a canary.
[14:13.180 --> 14:16.240]  Yeah. Yeah, a very, like, a hilarious canary.
[14:16.520 --> 14:18.820]  So is that the end of your basket weaving update, Andrew?
[14:19.120 --> 14:20.940]  Yeah, I'm gonna weave a basket. Okay.
[14:20.980 --> 14:23.880]  That's about it, yeah. And also, uh...
[14:23.880 --> 14:24.720]  I'm excited. What was her name?
[14:25.120 --> 14:26.480]  Leona Waddell. Pretty good.
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.440]  Have you got any new leads on a face tattoo? Anything like that?
[14:30.760 --> 14:32.660]  That's sort of in the works. Okay.
[14:32.900 --> 14:35.600]  I don't know. There's a discussion happening, I guess.
[14:35.620 --> 14:38.880]  Because I think that's one of the things I like about F*** Face is that there's always
[14:39.320 --> 14:42.520]  updates between episodes. Like, I feel like we are actually getting somewhere.
[14:42.720 --> 14:45.020]  This is... there's progression in this podcast.
[14:45.440 --> 14:48.180]  I... you know what? That's a good point, Gavin. I hadn't thought about that, but you're right.
[14:48.720 --> 14:52.040]  Speaking of F*** Facing or F***ing and Facing,
[14:53.140 --> 14:56.020]  did anybody f*** themselves this week, F*** Face?
[14:57.660 --> 15:02.400]  Any F*** Facing? I had an anxiety attack about if Yoshi f***s.
[15:02.980 --> 15:06.960]  That happens. Well, he just lays eggs, though.
[15:07.360 --> 15:10.320]  Well, that's the thing. Yeah, I was thinking about, well, like, how does that happen?
[15:10.700 --> 15:14.540]  Does he just lay... do they just lay them? Or, like, how does... is there a process?
[15:14.760 --> 15:17.100]  Do they ever explain this? I think I know.
[15:17.560 --> 15:20.500]  Doesn't Yoshi eat people? Like, can he hold them in his mouth?
[15:20.860 --> 15:23.740]  Uh, yeah, he eats Koopas and stuff, yeah. Yeah, I guess.
[15:23.740 --> 15:29.320]  I wonder if he extracts semen from them in that process, and then that's how he fertilizes his
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.660]  own eggs. Like, you think it's a cute, funny moment in the game, but what's really happening
[15:33.660 --> 15:42.820]  behind the beak, if you will, or the mouth, is a very anatomically disgusting extraction process
[15:42.820 --> 15:46.520]  by which he removes Koopa semen. Someone's been reading the Mario
[15:46.520 --> 15:49.720]  Encyclopedia. That sounds like a pretty official explanation to me.
[15:50.020 --> 15:52.080]  Why were you worried about this this week?
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.660]  Well, I was just thinking about it, and then I thought, well, they lay eggs. What else lay eggs?
[15:56.660 --> 15:59.900]  And I think chickens. And I thought, well, I've never seen a chicken flock.
[16:00.760 --> 16:02.720]  I'm pretty... like, I don't know how that works.
[16:03.040 --> 16:03.700]  It's not pretty.
[16:04.120 --> 16:09.640]  A chicken lays unfertilized eggs most, you know, in farming. They're not getting railed to lay eggs.
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.920]  I don't... you're like, I don't know. I was just thinking about eggs. So then I went on YouTube,
[16:14.140 --> 16:19.780]  and I looked up process of, like, making an egg, of, like, the creation of an egg,
[16:19.780 --> 16:26.360]  and I got 10 seconds in and realized I was watching a human video of how babies are born,
[16:26.940 --> 16:33.900]  and that I did not learn enough in my 45-minute class. There were some holes that were missing.
[16:34.700 --> 16:38.160]  Well, let me tell you, I owned chickens for about two years there,
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.920]  and you do not want to see them. Well, first off, they don't make love. They have very aggressive,
[16:44.260 --> 16:47.920]  angry sex, and it's not pretty, and you don't want to see it. You're better off not knowing.
[16:47.920 --> 16:49.800]  So were you trying to breed chickens?
[16:50.220 --> 16:54.100]  Well, I wasn't trying to breed them, but I had a rooster with my six hens,
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.160]  and so they would get it on occasionally.
[16:56.160 --> 16:57.780]  What was the point of the rooster?
[16:58.180 --> 17:03.720]  To protect them, but eventually I had to get rid of the rooster because he was harming the hens,
[17:04.280 --> 17:07.900]  and then what happens is one of the other hens becomes the protector of the group,
[17:08.120 --> 17:10.840]  and that's what happened. So it turned out it was fine.
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.640]  I'm so stupid that when Gavin asked what was the rooster for, I answered... he asked you.
[17:16.640 --> 17:19.100]  In my head, I answered alarm clock, like that makes sense.
[17:22.080 --> 17:25.680]  Yeah, I mean, that's why I wouldn't want the rooster part. It's just they're loud as hell.
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.040]  I actually... I had such a bad experience, but I love those chickens so much,
[17:30.080 --> 17:33.360]  and they were so much fun to have, but I had just like... I don't know if...
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.720]  I live in the city, and there's just like city possums and city raccoons are brutal,
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.560]  and even in their chicken coop, they would like rip holes in it and like steal the chickens,
[17:44.560 --> 17:50.900]  and I remember my neighbor came over one day, this very polite, usually like 50-year-old woman,
[17:51.100 --> 17:54.900]  and just lit into me about how loud my chickens were at like four in the morning,
[17:55.020 --> 17:58.460]  and I was like, yeah, they got murdered. A raccoon killed them, and she's like...
[17:59.020 --> 18:01.600]  and she's like... just kept going and going. I'm like, my husband's got to get up for work,
[18:01.640 --> 18:04.080]  and he can't be listening to your damn chickens all... and I'm like, they're dead!
[18:04.400 --> 18:08.520]  I don't know how... and she's like... she wouldn't stop, and I'm like, lady, they were murdered!
[18:09.140 --> 18:14.260]  They don't... I don't have them anymore! Stop... I'm dealing with the loss of like three chickens,
[18:14.260 --> 18:21.440]  you're yelling at me! Let me mourn my chickens! Anyway, that lady and I became enemies after that.
[18:22.360 --> 18:26.300]  That's really tough to recover from. I don't see a way in which that gets amended.
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.420]  Talk about kicking somebody when they're down. I'm like, well, it's not gonna be a problem anymore,
[18:30.500 --> 18:34.120]  because the chickens are dead! You know? And she's like, it better not be! And I'm like,
[18:34.280 --> 18:40.160]  oh my god. So, I moved. Eventually. I mean, yeah, I guess like I don't think
[18:40.160 --> 18:42.960]  I've ever been to a funeral where somebody was just talking shit about the person.
[18:44.480 --> 18:47.680]  Hey, what was the... didn't you have a thing at your house? I mean, you moved recently,
[18:47.820 --> 18:51.440]  but didn't you have a thing a couple months ago, Andrew, where you were convinced somebody
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.560]  was putting like badger cages in your yard or something? Oh, yeah. What does that mean?
[18:56.920 --> 19:01.800]  There's... it wasn't... it wasn't badger cages. There was, I think, like someone living in my
[19:01.800 --> 19:07.000]  backyard for a period of time. And that's how it like came to light. I was up late one night,
[19:07.120 --> 19:11.720]  and I keep my window open, and I could hear like footsteps outside my window, and I was on a second
[19:11.720 --> 19:15.940]  story, but it was just our backyard. And it didn't really sound like an animal, but I kind of
[19:15.940 --> 19:20.280]  ignored it, even though it freaked me out. And then it happened again another night, the next
[19:20.280 --> 19:24.220]  night at around the same time. I heard it again, and I started really thinking there's somebody
[19:24.820 --> 19:29.420]  back there. And then it happened a third night in a row, but it was earlier, so I said, fuck this,
[19:29.460 --> 19:33.380]  I'm going to see what's out there. So I grabbed the shitty flashlight, and I couldn't see anything,
[19:33.500 --> 19:37.600]  and I walked on my deck, and I just started shining it in the backyard. And all of a sudden,
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.380]  I just heard something bolt that sounded like a human, like it was too slow to be an animal,
[19:42.520 --> 19:47.540]  and they moved through like all the bushes on the corner of the yard. And that was terrifying.
[19:47.640 --> 19:49.740]  How many legs did it sound like it had?
[19:49.840 --> 19:53.660]  It sounded like two. It sounded like a pretty big person just trying to like move out,
[19:53.680 --> 19:59.540]  because they saw the light. And so that was creepy. But then you kind of just forget about
[19:59.540 --> 20:06.120]  it over time. And then we were moving, or the people below were moving, and there's some issue
[20:06.120 --> 20:09.760]  like they couldn't reach something behind the house, and there's all this garbage there from
[20:09.760 --> 20:14.940]  someone who had previously lived there. And in conversation, they were like, so why did you guys
[20:14.940 --> 20:19.740]  put those hamster cages down here? And we said, what do you mean? And they said, well, why are
[20:19.740 --> 20:24.180]  there... we've been here over like the last six months, there have been like four or five hamster
[20:24.180 --> 20:29.700]  cages added to this trash pile. And it wasn't us, and it wasn't them. So whoever was down there was
[20:30.660 --> 20:31.720]  putting hamster cages.
[20:31.720 --> 20:35.500]  Do you think they were releasing hamsters in your yard and then just
[20:35.500 --> 20:36.900]  putting the hamster cage down?
[20:37.340 --> 20:41.180]  I have no idea. But it was weird. It was a weird week. Geoff, you were in like Europe.
[20:41.760 --> 20:45.860]  I was like messaging you at like 2am like, there's a hamster person in my backyard.
[20:45.940 --> 20:50.780]  You're like, somebody's living in my yard and I don't know what to do. And I was like, you're
[20:51.180 --> 20:55.900]  fucking... you're insane is what... you need to go to the doctor is your problem. Nobody's living
[20:55.900 --> 21:00.560]  in your backyard. And then when you told me no, and they're putting hamster cages, or I thought
[21:01.240 --> 21:06.740]  hamster cages in my yard. I thought you really have lost the plot. I... fuck. Do you have an
[21:06.740 --> 21:09.980]  enemy on the island? Maybe that's trying to drive you insane? Have you considered that?
[21:10.720 --> 21:16.660]  You know, that was before my lasagna championship days. I really fumbled on lasagna. That was a
[21:16.660 --> 21:18.020]  real struggle, but I got over it.
[21:18.800 --> 21:21.220]  That is now the officiable way to pronounce lasagna.
[21:21.560 --> 21:23.820]  Officiable, yes. Add it to the officiable list.
[21:24.840 --> 21:30.120]  Gotta really just struggle on that LA, but keep trying. Gotta keep trying till you get over that
[21:30.120 --> 21:30.260]  hump.
[21:30.260 --> 21:31.860]  Did you ever find a hamster?
[21:32.140 --> 21:37.140]  No, I didn't find anything. They were gone after that, but I think I heard a similar
[21:37.140 --> 21:39.740]  noise like five or six months later, but it was only one night.
[21:40.080 --> 21:41.160]  Is this why you moved?
[21:41.560 --> 21:45.680]  No, it's not why I moved, but it was a great, you know, it's like I'm not gonna miss the
[21:45.680 --> 21:52.000]  hamster person. Gonna be mad like, why didn't I get my tip at Christmas? Living in your backyard.
[21:54.060 --> 21:58.060]  I would love to know what was going on with those hamster cages. If they were trying to
[21:58.060 --> 22:02.580]  release some sort of plague on you, or if they were trying to capture, maybe they used
[22:02.580 --> 22:07.300]  to live. All right, here we go. Maybe it was the you that used to live there. Not Andrew,
[22:07.500 --> 22:11.280]  but an Andrew type person, right? Someone who's weird enough.
[22:11.300 --> 22:12.380]  That's horrifying to think about.
[22:13.040 --> 22:20.000]  Yeah, and just an oddball kid who maybe he and his family moved away to the other side
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.820]  of town and his hamster escaped. And so every night he would come back, or maybe like once
[22:25.820 --> 22:30.460]  a week when he could get away, he would come and release a hamster cage in the yard and
[22:30.460 --> 22:35.360]  fill it with stuff, hoping that his pet hamster would be triggered by it and that he could recoup
[22:35.360 --> 22:38.600]  it. And every night you would scare him off before that moment.
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.000]  I mean, that's a narrative. That was complex. That went deeper than I assumed.
[22:43.660 --> 22:47.980]  I don't know. And the sad thing is, is that hamster was probably his best friend,
[22:48.200 --> 22:52.180]  or maybe it was pregnant and the hamster went off to have the little baby hamsters in the woods
[22:52.180 --> 22:55.840]  and just never came back. I don't know. It's really, honestly, it's probably heartbreaking,
[22:55.980 --> 22:59.400]  this story, and I'm getting kind of sad thinking about it. I just hope this kid finds his best
[22:59.400 --> 23:03.400]  friend or his best friend's litter. Andrew, that story that Geoff just
[23:03.400 --> 23:06.860]  came up with on the spot had more depth than the basket weaving update.
[23:07.260 --> 23:11.200]  That's hurtful, Gavin. I'm going to learn how to write,
[23:11.320 --> 23:15.020]  fuck you, Gavin. And then I'll film it in slo-mo so you can really appreciate it.
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.760]  You don't technically need this car. You say that out loud to yourself.
[23:25.200 --> 23:28.940]  You say, I have no space. You say, eh, I'm just looking.
[23:29.360 --> 23:34.200]  Then you click. Then you zoom in on photo number 87 and whisper, oh no.
[23:34.700 --> 23:37.200]  Then you text a friend, the one who always enables you.
[23:37.540 --> 23:42.260]  You say to yourself, this is the last one, knowing it is not.
[23:42.260 --> 23:47.860]  You don't need this car, but maybe, just maybe, this car needs you.
[23:48.260 --> 23:50.300]  Bring a trailer. It's never just a car.

[24:41.840 --> 24:45.780]  Manscaped offers precision engineered tools for your family jewels. That rhymes.
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.240]  Let me talk about my own personal experience with razors and my penis. I don't know if you've ever
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.320]  nicked yourself before, like with a straight razor or with an electric razor, but if you've
[24:54.320 --> 24:59.260]  done it once, that was one too many times and you know you never ever ever want to do it again.
[24:59.700 --> 25:05.120]  I treat that area of my body very preciously and I try to take good care of it. It takes good
[25:05.120 --> 25:09.120]  care of me, you know. That's why Manscaped has redesigned the electric trimmer, because they
[25:09.120 --> 25:13.380]  want you to take care of you. The Manscaped engineering team spent 18 months perfecting
[25:13.380 --> 25:19.040]  the greatest ball hair trimmer ever created and just released the new and improved Lawnmower 3.0.
[25:19.240 --> 25:22.920]  Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you spent 18 months perfecting anything?
[25:23.140 --> 25:28.740]  You've never done it. You're too lazy. They're not. Think about it. The third generation trimmer
[25:28.740 --> 25:33.460]  features a cutting edge ceramic blade to prevent manscaping accidents. Ceramic. Think about it.
[25:33.460 --> 25:36.960]  What do they make out of ceramics? They make spark plugs. How important are spark plugs? Cars don't
[25:36.960 --> 25:41.540]  run without them. Think about it. Hmm? Millions of balls are about to be nick free thanks to
[25:41.540 --> 25:45.900]  Manscaped's advanced skin safe technology. Manscaping accidents are finally a thing of
[25:45.900 --> 25:54.440]  the past. When I tell you this is premium, I mean premium. P-R-E-M-I-U-M. The battery will last up
[25:54.440 --> 25:58.900]  to 90 minutes, so you can take a longer shave. That sounds better than a massage. One of the
[25:58.900 --> 26:03.920]  coolest features is the LED light which illuminates grooming areas for a closer and more precise
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.520]  trimming. You want to be able to see what you're doing down there, trust me. You make one wrong
[26:07.520 --> 26:14.040]  move and whoa! I'm John Bobbitt. They've also upgraded to a 7,000 RPM motor, that's more than
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.680]  my lawnmower, with quiet stroke technology. And let's not forget about the charging stand.
[26:19.720 --> 26:24.860]  It charges. It stands. I don't know what more you want. Show your mower off loud and proud
[26:24.860 --> 26:29.660]  because this intelligently designed stand is a rapid charging dock powered by USB.

[27:09.760 --> 27:15.040]  want, I don't know, your family or friends or an entire podcast audience to know about it?
[27:15.040 --> 27:24.400]  I'm not saying I have, but if I was potentially a very private collector of something like Beanie
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.680]  Babies and also a reseller, I would want to keep that private. I know most of you are probably
[27:29.680 --> 27:35.240]  thinking, why don't you just use incognito mode on your computer? Assuming that I was a Beanie
[27:35.240 --> 27:40.100]  Baby aficionado. Well let me tell you something, incognito mode does not hide your activity. It
[27:40.100 --> 27:45.020]  doesn't matter what mode you use or how many times you clear your browsing history and whether you
[27:45.020 --> 27:49.780]  update your local host file to change the word Beanie Baby to anything else, your internet
[27:49.780 --> 27:54.500]  service provider can still see every single website you've ever visited. That's why even
[27:54.500 --> 27:59.300]  when I'm at home, which I usually am because of the pandemic, I never go online without using
[27:59.300 --> 28:05.320]  ExpressVPN. Especially if I'm maybe or maybe not searching for the rarest and most expensive Beanie
[28:05.320 --> 28:10.160]  Babies on earth. It doesn't matter if you get your internet from Verizon or Comcast or 123
[28:10.160 --> 28:17.860]  Internet or Internet XLB or any local ISP you have. ISPs in the U.S. can legally sell your
[28:17.860 --> 28:22.200]  information to ad companies. Gross. ExpressVPN is an app that reroutes your internet connection
[28:22.200 --> 28:26.940]  through their secure servers so your ISP can't see the sites you visit or the Beanie Babies
[28:26.940 --> 28:32.600]  you're bidding on. ExpressVPN also keeps your information secure by encrypting 100% of your data
[28:32.600 --> 28:37.600]  that Beanie Baby or otherwise with the most powerful encryption available. Most of the time,
[28:37.600 --> 28:42.580]  I don't even realize I have ExpressVPN on. It runs so seamlessly in the background and it's so easy
[28:42.580 --> 28:47.380]  to use that it's like a dream. All you have to do is tap one button and you're protected.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.960]  ExpressVPN is available on all of your devices, phones, computers, even your smart TV. Not your
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.940]  dumb TV, but definitely your smart TV. There's no excuse for you not to be using it or to still

[29:27.800 --> 29:32.760]  talking over me? Don't talk over me. Expressvpn.com slash face to learn more. I was thinking
[29:32.760 --> 29:39.900]  the other day what my very first f*** face was in my life. And that got me wondering,
[29:40.360 --> 29:45.980]  do you guys remember the first time you f*** faced? I have like a series of them,
[29:46.060 --> 29:49.880]  but not like... I don't have like an event like it sounds like you have. I don't know that mine's
[29:49.880 --> 29:54.100]  an event. I just... and I don't know that I can consciously take credit for it, although I would
[29:54.100 --> 30:02.320]  like to. But I think my first... if I had to think, my very, very, very first f*** face would have been
[30:02.320 --> 30:13.360]  my birth. If I can take credit for being born. And here's why. I was born in 1975. So it was a
[30:13.360 --> 30:19.960]  different time back then. Yeah. And I was supposed... my mom didn't get a sex test to determine
[30:19.960 --> 30:25.320]  what I was going to be. She was poor and living in a trailer and she was like 18. It's a very
[30:25.320 --> 30:31.100]  typical Alabama story. And so she thought, and my grandmother and my family all thought I was
[30:31.100 --> 30:38.340]  going to be a girl. I was supposed to be born. Amanda Jean was going to be my name. And I came
[30:38.340 --> 30:43.300]  out with a penis. It wasn't much of one, but it was enough. And so I'd like to think that... and
[30:43.300 --> 30:47.280]  that's... and so I was never supposed to be... I was never supposed to be a boy. I was supposed to
[30:47.280 --> 30:52.540]  be a girl. And so this... it's a layered f*** facing. So I think that was my first f*** face,
[30:52.600 --> 30:59.380]  was I pulled one over on my mom by being born a boy. She then f*** faced me immediately after
[30:59.380 --> 31:03.560]  in two ways that I have never... one way I've recovered from the second one, I don't think I
[31:03.560 --> 31:10.140]  ever will. Because I was supposed to be a girl and my mom was really poor, her and my grandmother,
[31:10.580 --> 31:18.540]  they made a year's worth of dresses and girls clothing for me. And I then was forced to wear
[31:18.540 --> 31:22.760]  pretty much mostly girls clothing for the first year I was alive because that's what they had.
[31:23.260 --> 31:29.040]  And so my f*** face got me f*** face there because then I had to... I had to dress as a woman for the
[31:29.040 --> 31:35.060]  first year of my life. But the worst f*** face I realized that my mom got over on me is because
[31:35.060 --> 31:41.860]  I... she picked out the name Amanda Jean and I was born with the little penis thing. She on the
[31:41.860 --> 31:46.460]  spot just picked a name, I assume, which is... or I don't know, maybe there was a Toys R Us commercial
[31:46.460 --> 31:52.740]  on TV. So she named me Geoffrey with a G. Not that we have... which is... I've looked it up. It's
[31:52.740 --> 31:58.840]  Welsh and it's... I don't know how... it has nothing to do with my family. I don't know where
[31:58.840 --> 32:03.100]  the f*** she got the name from and I don't think I've ever even asked her. But she named me
[32:03.100 --> 32:10.220]  Geoffrey Paul. Obviously, I replaced the Paul with laser very wisely as an adult. But so I realized
[32:10.220 --> 32:16.960]  that now every day since my birth, since the day my mom f*** faced me with the G. Geoffrey,
[32:17.520 --> 32:24.280]  every time I've had to have to tell my name to a new person, she f*** faces me. For 45 years,
[32:24.280 --> 32:29.880]  every time I have to tell somebody my name is Geoff, it's a f*** face. Because I have to spell
[32:29.880 --> 32:35.080]  it for them or they get it wrong. And at the first day of school, kindergarten through 12th
[32:35.080 --> 32:40.340]  grade was a... probably why I didn't go to college, honestly, was a f***ing nightmare of teachers not
[32:40.920 --> 32:52.260]  going through the roll and going, uh, Godfrey, uh, Joffrey, Goreflux, uh, Gilflip. And then an
[32:52.260 --> 32:56.280]  entire class of people laughing at me and then me going, well, that's it for the year. I'm a
[32:56.280 --> 33:01.720]  pariah in this class. And, uh, that, that was probably the worst f*** facing I've ever got.
[33:01.920 --> 33:05.240]  And, uh, I gotta, I gotta give credit to my mom. I thought I had her with the penis,
[33:05.240 --> 33:09.660]  but she really f***ed me with the name. Were you friends with Goreflux at school?
[33:12.660 --> 33:17.760]  I don't know that I ever knew a Goreflux, but the worst one I ever got, uh, was the, my 10th grade,
[33:17.760 --> 33:22.900]  uh, chemistry teacher, uh, who I spent a year f***ing facing by the way. And then
[33:22.900 --> 33:30.040]  she spent a year f***ing facing my grades. Uh, rightly, rightly so. No offense to her.
[33:30.180 --> 33:35.500]  I like, I, I deserved it. Um, I spent more time outside of the classroom, sitting outside,
[33:35.620 --> 33:39.340]  not being allowed to do class work or participate in class than I spent in the class.
[33:39.680 --> 33:42.800]  Was this the same woman whose car keys you took at one point?
[33:43.240 --> 33:47.780]  Yeah. Yeah. I hadn't forgot. I'd stole them. And then she was taking a cab to work.
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.660]  And then I had to get her keys back to her without her knowing I took them. Yeah,
[33:53.740 --> 33:57.740]  that was the whole thing. Um, this is the exact same lady. She called me Guilford
[33:58.340 --> 34:03.000]  Firk because my last name used to be Fink. I've had a shit ton of names through no fault of my
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.200]  own. Uh, yeah. She thought my name was Guilford. My name was Geoffrey Fink at the time. And she
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.380]  called me Guilford Firk. And so for the entire 10th grade, I was Guilford Firk to everybody who
[34:12.380 --> 34:17.740]  knew me in every class. It died in the summer going into 11th grade. But I spent the 10th
[34:17.740 --> 34:20.740]  fucking grade being Guilford Firk. And it's back now, right?
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.000]  God, you must be like the IRS's worst nightmare. How do they keep track of you?
[34:27.220 --> 34:29.460]  Well, same social security number, so it's not too hard.
[34:29.680 --> 34:29.880]  Yeah.
[34:30.200 --> 34:37.520]  And my extreme paranoia about not paying taxes and going to jail. So I make them well aware.
[34:37.740 --> 34:41.320]  Yeah, no, it's the most horrifying thing you can do in America is earn money.
[34:41.320 --> 34:46.780]  It's funny you mentioned the name thing. I don't know why I have this distinct memory. This is so
[34:46.780 --> 34:52.680]  embarrassing to say is before I knew you. And I don't know if it was I talking about content or
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.860]  something with my cousin. I called you Geoff. I thought I thought your name was Geoff for a period
[34:57.860 --> 34:58.540]  of my life.
[34:59.040 --> 35:01.500]  Oh, yeah, I get that one a lot. Really? That's common? Okay.
[35:01.640 --> 35:02.800]  I don't feel as dumb.
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.680]  No, no, it's common. It's an it's common. It's a it's commonly insulting for sure.
[35:07.140 --> 35:08.120]  You should feel bad about it.
[35:12.320 --> 35:17.780]  Well, it's okay, Andrew, because for most of most of the first I would say six months I knew you.
[35:17.980 --> 35:24.100]  I referred to you as that fucking Andrew Panton, the ball carrier and griffball that fucking kid.
[35:24.320 --> 35:27.440]  Fuck him. How does he do that? Fuck Andrew Panton.
[35:27.820 --> 35:29.840]  Do you still have your griffball skills, Andrew?
[35:30.380 --> 35:34.320]  No, no, I never really had them to begin with. You guys were just all terrible.
[35:34.660 --> 35:35.000]  That's true.
[35:35.300 --> 35:37.320]  Big fish, small pond type.
[35:40.200 --> 35:44.800]  But it was but wasn't that that was wrong. It was like a slightly bigger fish in a really tiny,
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.380]  like a puddle. I was like a small fish in a puddle.
[35:48.500 --> 35:51.300]  It's made griffball, by the way, if you don't know what we're talking about. It's a dumb
[35:51.720 --> 35:56.380]  video game that Gavin and our friend Bernie made in Halo, like a game inside of a game.
[35:56.420 --> 35:57.120]  So it's a game type.
[35:57.620 --> 36:00.200]  Yeah, that became very popular and became official part of Halo. Actually,
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.040]  I think it's a it's an official game type for the last couple games, which...
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.280]  And it's named after you.
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.980]  Well, it's named after a character I played in a cartoon. Yeah. But yeah, I guess so. I guess
[36:08.980 --> 36:12.100]  it's named after me, though. The point of it, I'm not talking about a face. The point of the
[36:12.100 --> 36:16.860]  game is to kill me. So thanks for inventing a game where the point do you win by killing me?
[36:17.140 --> 36:20.900]  Also, I feel like because we were sort of there at the beginning, we were all quite good
[36:20.900 --> 36:25.180]  at the start, I would say, except for you, Geoff. I don't think you were ever good at griffball.
[36:25.340 --> 36:26.400]  I think you were always terrible.
[36:26.620 --> 36:29.140]  I was never good at the game where the point was to kill me.
[36:29.140 --> 36:35.140]  Nah. Something always held me back on the griffball fields. I don't know why. I don't
[36:35.140 --> 36:40.520]  know what it was. Hey, Gav, I have a question. Thinking about my childhood, I remember about
[36:40.520 --> 36:44.860]  a specific moment from your childhood. And I wonder, would you consider that period in your
[36:44.860 --> 36:49.480]  life where you didn't talk for three or four years? Was that a **** face?
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.760]  I guess it was. That was I mean, yeah, once again, like yours wasn't my decision.
[36:56.920 --> 37:02.860]  I just became, you know, when you're like four or five, you sort of take control over the
[37:02.860 --> 37:07.020]  mindless blob that you've been the entire time. And you're like, all right, I'm driving this
[37:07.020 --> 37:12.920]  thing. I guess I'm making decisions for this lump of meat. But for some reason at school,
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.900]  I didn't talk. And I just became sentient in that. And I was like, well, I want to talk to people.
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.060]  I can't just start talking now, though, because everyone will be like, Jesus Christ, he said
[37:23.060 --> 37:31.060]  something. I just stayed silent. Have you heard this, Andrew? No. He described it to me. What
[37:31.060 --> 37:35.120]  grade was it this started in? Oh, right at the beginning. From the moment I set foot into a
[37:35.120 --> 37:41.740]  school, I was like, I don't like what's happening. This is before I took over. Apparently, I don't
[37:41.740 --> 37:46.080]  want to say anything. The way he described it to me the first time he told me, Andrew,
[37:46.460 --> 37:49.300]  is he went to school the first day and he didn't say anything because he didn't,
[37:49.380 --> 37:52.680]  you know, he didn't know who to talk to or who's shy. And then so when he went to school the second
[37:52.680 --> 37:55.920]  day, he thought, well, I didn't say anything yesterday, so I better keep my mouth shut today.
[37:56.460 --> 38:02.560]  And then he just did that for like three years. Like he was the kid in class that doesn't talk
[38:02.560 --> 38:08.400]  like the mute, silent kid that everybody thinks is weird, I assume. Yeah, but it was fine. Like
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.460]  people would still talk to me and they they could tell that I would understand, like I would nod
[38:12.460 --> 38:20.520]  and stuff. And then I would go I would get home and be like, oh, God, just had this pent up energy.
[38:20.520 --> 38:27.440]  And then one day, I think it was year two, I decided I was bored of this existence. And I
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.260]  thought I'm going to talk when they because the teachers had already got into the swing of
[38:31.260 --> 38:36.340]  ignoring me for the for like the morning register. They would read everyone's names, you know,
[38:36.360 --> 38:43.860]  be like Gavin, Goreflax or whatever. And they would say Gavin and just look for me and people
[38:43.860 --> 38:46.860]  would point at me and I would just like sometimes put a hand up and they'd be like, yeah, he's here.
[38:46.860 --> 38:53.460]  And then one day, the beginning of year two, I was like, yeah, here. And every single person
[38:53.460 --> 39:00.460]  in the room looked at me. And I was like, this is my worst nightmare. And then the teacher just
[39:00.460 --> 39:05.320]  said the next the next name on the list. And that was it. That was it. From then on, it was fine.
[39:05.360 --> 39:09.560]  I was like, what the hell was all the fuss about? What was the next moment you spoke? Do you
[39:09.560 --> 39:14.920]  remember? Like at recess, some kid was like, oh, Gavin, you want to play a game of Nobby Tobs or
[39:14.920 --> 39:18.700]  whatever. And you were like, oh, I guess I do. Yeah, it was just people were just coming over
[39:18.700 --> 39:22.640]  and be like, so you talk now? And I was like, I guess so. Yeah, I just went for it.
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.200]  You think you'd be naturally equipped to be a mime at this point? Like if you got into that,
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.500]  would you just be immediately good? How did you communicate at all? Like you must have emoted.
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.380]  There's no like you just didn't do anything. I did quite enjoy the silent times because
[39:38.380 --> 39:42.740]  I got out of doing stuff that I didn't want to do anyway. Like we during like reading,
[39:42.740 --> 39:46.840]  they would just like pass a book around and one person would read to the rest of the class and
[39:46.840 --> 39:51.900]  they just passed it over me because they knew I wouldn't. Suddenly I'm there having to read
[39:51.900 --> 39:57.140]  and everyone's you know, it was it was a shyness thing. You never got called on to answer questions
[39:57.140 --> 40:02.000]  or anything because there was no point. Yeah, until I answered my name that one day. If I
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.480]  look back on it, I probably should have kept it up a little bit longer. You know, it's never too
[40:06.480 --> 40:14.380]  late. Go into what Andrew said about you like having those innate mime skills. That makes me
[40:14.380 --> 40:18.260]  think when my kid went to preschool, she went to a French immersion preschool for like three or four
[40:18.260 --> 40:23.720]  years. And they only spoke French. And so she learned and was fluent in French and hated it
[40:23.720 --> 40:28.600]  and stopped speaking it. And now doesn't remember a word of French. But her teacher told me it's
[40:28.600 --> 40:36.200]  okay because when she's an adult, she her her her like her mouth muscles learned how to how to do
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.020]  those sounds and pronounce and pronounce things that way. And she'll always have that. And if
[40:41.020 --> 40:46.340]  she ever decides to pick up French again, she'll pick it up immediately. Because her her, I don't
[40:46.340 --> 40:51.220]  know her mouth knows how to form words that way from an early age, like since memory, I bet you
[40:51.220 --> 40:58.320]  have innate mime memory, where your body would just snap right back into it. I'd be doing all
[40:58.320 --> 41:07.020]  the gestures. I feel like that'd be like a cop out answer. I'm trapped in a box. Like, how are you
[41:07.020 --> 41:12.040]  gonna prove the French teacher wrong? Like come back in 20 years? Like, that's such a great argument
[41:12.040 --> 41:17.420]  to make. You can't prove them wrong until like 20 years passes. I could I could prove her wrong. I'm
[41:17.420 --> 41:23.520]  still on the mailing list. I still donate money to them every year. Is the sole reason why you're
[41:23.520 --> 41:30.340]  waiting? You promised me! Why French though? French is a is a useless language in Texas. You want
[41:30.340 --> 41:37.360]  Spanish, surely? Uh, yeah, no, if I can be totally honest with you, I mean, high-mindedly, the idea
[41:37.360 --> 41:44.200]  was my ex-wife spoke fluent French and they could speak it together and it would be like a family
[41:44.200 --> 41:49.440]  thing. And then she could help her learn and that kind of thing. But the real honest to God reason
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.780]  was that it was the only preschool we could get her in. Like, it's just like in Texas, in Austin,
[41:56.300 --> 42:02.880]  you have to sign up for preschool probably six months before you conceive to get into a program.
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.260]  And so, uh, we didn't do that. And so when Millie was about a year old, we realized we were gonna
[42:08.260 --> 42:12.740]  need at about two, we were gonna need preschool. So we started looking and they were like,
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.040]  you want to take, you want to put your kid in preschool in a year? Yeah, fat chance buddy. You
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.460]  should have started this process four years ago. And it's like, she wasn't, she was minus three
[42:21.460 --> 42:25.320]  four years ago. And they're like, that's not my problem. Uh, so we were able to get her into the
[42:25.320 --> 42:28.980]  French immersion school. So then we were like, yeah, we, we planned that the whole time. Absolutely.
[42:29.440 --> 42:32.720]  All right, Andrew, I think for next week you should try and get your kid into preschool,
[42:33.020 --> 42:38.420]  even though he's yet to be born. Oh man, I need more than three. I need like negative 20.
[42:40.860 --> 42:46.360]  So I, so I fucked, my face was, my first face was at birth. Uh, Gavin, I don't know if that was your
[42:46.360 --> 42:52.100]  first face, but it was. Oh, so your first face was when you decided not to talk ever did. What
[42:52.100 --> 42:58.200]  about you, Andrew? Do you have any, at least early faces? I have a bunch. Um, you guys know,
[42:58.280 --> 43:01.860]  like before like a movie starts, that's like dangerous or something. They say like, don't
[43:01.860 --> 43:06.580]  perform these stunts at home or like, this is a movie. Don't try to try to do those. I realized
[43:06.580 --> 43:12.760]  those were really made for me. I learned a lot from movies growing up. Like I have a distinct
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.300]  memory of a, like I'd, I'd hear words in movies. I could kind of watch whatever I wanted when I was
[43:17.300 --> 43:21.400]  a kid when I was like four or five and I'd hear like curse words and stuff and I wouldn't know
[43:21.400 --> 43:25.460]  what they meant, but I could kind of tell what they meant based on how the person in the scene
[43:25.460 --> 43:31.560]  reacted to them. So I get a gauge of like how bad the word was that way. Okay. And there was one
[43:31.560 --> 43:35.620]  movie where someone flipped somebody off and it was kind of like, they were kind of annoyed,
[43:35.640 --> 43:40.220]  but also like they thought it was funny. So I had no idea how to read it. I spent the entire day.
[43:40.220 --> 43:44.660]  I was probably like four thinking, is this bad? Is this like an insult? Is this like a,
[43:44.840 --> 43:48.360]  this is like a secret like wave? Like, what is this? I don't know what this move is.
[43:48.660 --> 43:54.960]  So my way to figure this out was as soon as I got home, I walked to the side, I walked in front of
[43:54.960 --> 44:00.300]  my house on the sidewalk and I decided that the next car that drove by, I'm going to flip them
[44:00.300 --> 44:06.820]  off. And depending on how they react, I'll know if I should continue to do this or if I shouldn't do
[44:06.820 --> 44:13.380]  this. So I waited like five or 10 minutes. And then this really, and I remember this so vividly,
[44:13.440 --> 44:20.040]  it was this piece of shit truck, just completely beat up holes in the side. It was a mess. And
[44:20.040 --> 44:25.840]  this big guy driving it, he looked like kind of a Southern like stereotype character. And he looked
[44:25.840 --> 44:29.300]  at me and I looked at him and I had this huge grin on my face. Cause I'm like, I don't know
[44:29.300 --> 44:34.200]  what this means. So I want to kind of look nice, but it probably made it worse. So I smiling as
[44:34.200 --> 44:40.720]  wide as I could. And I flipped him off. And to this date, I think this is the angriest I've ever
[44:40.720 --> 44:47.400]  seen anybody in my life. He was irate. He was so mad. And he immediately flipped me back off again.
[44:47.540 --> 44:51.480]  And I was terrified. I was like, I don't know what I did to this person.
[44:51.660 --> 44:52.400]  And you were four?
[44:52.860 --> 44:54.020]  Yeah, it was like four or five.
[44:54.200 --> 44:58.400]  So he's there driving around, minding his own business. You're ruining his day. He's thinking,
[44:58.400 --> 45:03.160]  whose kid is this? Smugly flipping me off.
[45:03.800 --> 45:07.120]  I was very nervous. And I thought, why I do this in front of my own house?
[45:10.420 --> 45:14.840]  So you as a four year old, you're not thinking like, Oh, sweet. Super Nintendo. Or like,
[45:14.860 --> 45:19.920]  I'm going to play with blocks and shit. You're doing like studies on human communication based
[45:19.920 --> 45:22.700]  on movies. And you're testing that out in the real world.
[45:22.900 --> 45:26.700]  Yeah. I just, I didn't know what it meant. And I don't know. I like making people laugh. So
[45:26.700 --> 45:31.180]  in Godzilla, I used to watch that a lot as a kid. A helicopter gets shot down and they yell Mayday.
[45:31.420 --> 45:34.780]  I had no idea what that meant. But I just yell Mayday. Kids would laugh at it. So I'd
[45:34.780 --> 45:37.880]  yell Mayday all the time when I was in first grade playing tag.
[45:38.300 --> 45:41.680]  Well, maybe if you went to French school, Andrew, you would know what that meant.
[45:41.840 --> 45:44.100]  That's a great point. Probably known two languages.
[45:46.040 --> 45:52.040]  It's amazing how dumb the shit we used to do as kids is. And your story, Andrew,
[45:52.080 --> 45:55.720]  has reminded me of quite a few things I could talk about. But I don't know
[45:55.720 --> 46:00.020]  what the statute of limitations is on some stuff. You know what I mean?
[46:00.600 --> 46:03.700]  We're what, like 40 years out from your childhood at this point?
[46:04.340 --> 46:07.920]  Maybe we're like, maybe stuff I did when I was like 10 or 11. I was just thinking about the
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.260]  maddest I've ever seen somebody. And I mean, the maddest I've ever seen somebody is probably all
[46:12.260 --> 46:21.220]  of my wives. But I remember one time we used to, when I was maybe nine, when I lived in Florida,
[46:21.220 --> 46:26.900]  we used to just be little hooligans that we would dress up in camouflage like Rambo and
[46:26.900 --> 46:32.440]  run around the neighborhood at night. And I remember we used to, there was this pond in my
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.180]  neighborhood. And there was this like, we call it Pampas grass. I don't know if you guys know what
[46:36.180 --> 46:39.740]  that is. But it's popular in Florida. It's like this, it's about like a bush that's like maybe
[46:39.740 --> 46:45.960]  six feet tall. And if you touch it, it's got these long like razor sharp blades of grass that will
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.580]  cut you if you touch them. And in the middle are these like what looked like bamboo shoots with
[46:51.060 --> 46:55.180]  fluffy shit on the top of them. And you can rip those out and use them as like really weak swords
[46:55.180 --> 46:59.260]  and like, fuck around with them. And I remember one night, my friends and I were pulling a bunch
[46:59.260 --> 47:02.360]  of them out of the, just being hoodlums, and we're pulling a bunch of them out of the grass.
[47:02.520 --> 47:09.680]  And we started fucking throwing them at cars. And I remember, I was like, you guys suck here.
[47:09.800 --> 47:13.640]  And I actually, unfortunately, I have two stories about throwing shit at cars. And they're very
[47:13.640 --> 47:18.400]  similar, I realize. But I was like, you guys, you got to throw it like a javelin. And I picked up
[47:18.400 --> 47:23.120]  some pampas grass, and I fucking threw it at a car. And a little, I remember it was a Volkswagen
[47:23.120 --> 47:31.580]  bug. And, and I, and then I heard tires screech. And I heard a guy go, mother fucker. And I looked,
[47:32.220 --> 47:37.560]  I looked up, and because we'd like hid down under a ditch, and I looked up, and the guy's window was
[47:37.560 --> 47:47.160]  open. And, and I, it had gone into his driveway, into the window. And it didn't hit him. I don't
[47:47.160 --> 47:50.980]  think. But it like landed like on his dashboard right in front of him. He wasn't going fast. He
[47:50.980 --> 47:55.280]  was going like maybe 10 miles an hour. It was coming up to a stop sign. But the guy was just
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.420]  sitting there. And I remember looking up at him. And he looked at me. And there's this like fluffy
[48:01.420 --> 48:07.240]  shit in his car. And he goes, I'm gonna fucking kill you. And I heard his car door open, and I
[48:07.240 --> 48:13.760]  took off. And I probably, I probably ran, I might still be running, if I'm being honest with you.
[48:14.700 --> 48:19.460]  I probably ran for two straight hours. And I remember going like, I couldn't go home. I was
[48:19.460 --> 48:22.540]  convinced he would find out where I lived. And so I was trying to get my friends to let me spend the
[48:22.540 --> 48:26.900]  night at their houses. And all their parents were like, fuck you. And eventually, eventually, I just
[48:26.900 --> 48:31.060]  went, I just went home and snuck in the back. But I think that guy probably chased us. There were
[48:31.060 --> 48:36.880]  three of us for at least an hour on foot. Like he was so angry. Allegedly. Maybe that didn't happen.
[48:36.940 --> 48:39.440]  Maybe I made that up. Especially if the guy's still alive and listening to the story.
[48:39.440 --> 48:43.620]  Jesus. Yeah, I can, I can imagine that feeling of just like heart racing, just
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.700]  endlessly sprinting. And knowing an old guy's chasing after you. And old to me. He was probably
[48:48.700 --> 48:56.140]  30. He's probably in way better shape than I was. Oh, God. And that, that, and telling that story,
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.860]  it sounds so bad. It makes me not want to tell the next story. So maybe I won't.
[49:02.220 --> 49:06.420]  Because it's very similar, but worse. Maybe wait another decade. Yeah, maybe wait another decade,
[49:06.420 --> 49:13.340]  just in case. Let it really cool off. Yeah. God damn. The dumb shit we do as kids, man.
[49:14.680 --> 49:17.220]  I got into skateboarding because I saw a monkey do it.
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.880]  I got into skateboarding because a monkey did it? What does that mean?
[49:30.880 --> 49:37.000]  Have you not heard of the MVP film franchise? These are huge in my life. I mean, it makes sense
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.360]  they guess why I'm younger, but there are these series of movies called MVP, Most Valuable Primate,
[49:42.960 --> 49:49.100]  made by the people that made Air Bud, and I fucking love them. I was a big fan of the first
[49:49.100 --> 49:54.740]  one, which was about hockey. And then they made a second one, which is called The Most Vertical
[49:54.740 --> 49:58.660]  Primate, and that one was all about skateboarding, had Bob Burnquist in it, so you know it's official.
[49:59.260 --> 50:05.240]  Okay. Then they made a third one called MXP, Most Extreme Primate, about snowboarding. I'd
[50:05.240 --> 50:09.440]  watched that one the least. I don't really have opinions about that one. But I love the first two,
[50:09.800 --> 50:15.000]  genuinely. As a kid, I thought they were great. As an adult, I love them because their storylines
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.360]  are so overly complicated. The first movie is all about, he's in a research lab and they're
[50:21.360 --> 50:25.040]  doing experiments. It's like Planet of the Apes-ish, and he escapes it and then joins
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.560]  a hockey league and is the best hockey player ever. It's almost like a side story. The second
[50:29.560 --> 50:35.660]  movie is about, he's so fucking good at hockey, they frame him to get out of the league. Like,
[50:35.740 --> 50:41.800]  they set up a brawl and they cover a guy's glove with ketchup and then say that the monkey bit him
[50:41.800 --> 50:45.540]  so he gets thrown out of the league and he can't play anymore because he scored too many goals.
[50:46.140 --> 50:54.300]  They can't handle it. And they not only throw him out of the league, they make him homeless. It's
[50:54.300 --> 50:58.920]  like, they give him his jacket and some jeans and he's just homeless and he's just walking around.
[50:59.220 --> 51:03.440]  And for half that movie, he's just homeless. Why go to all those efforts to get the monkey out of
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.100]  the league? Why not just shoot him while he's walking to his car or something? It's a monkey.
[51:07.920 --> 51:14.280]  It's a kid's movie. This is a fucking kid, fellas. You're gonna put him in a room and just shoot him
[51:14.280 --> 51:20.300]  back in the head? I mean, I think framing him with a ketchup bite is a little excessive,
[51:20.300 --> 51:24.040]  but it's insane. You want to get him out of the league and just fucking kill him?
[51:25.400 --> 51:27.560]  What, you're going to go down for murder as a monkey?
[51:27.920 --> 51:29.500]  Gavin, you don't respect human life.
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.740]  Called out the legitimacy of the plot of a monkey skateboarding movie. He's like,
[51:33.740 --> 51:36.640]  that makes no sense. Why wouldn't they just shoot him? It's so much more complicated.
[51:36.640 --> 51:40.720]  The jail time for offering a monkey has to be shorter than offering a human.
[51:40.940 --> 51:45.460]  You know what though, Andrew? Let me just, let me just, I'll explain Gavin in one sentence right here.
[51:45.460 --> 51:52.920]  When he plays Halo, the first thing he does is kill every AI fucking UNSC soldier so that
[51:52.920 --> 51:56.040]  he can take their ammo and their weapons. He has no respect for life.
[51:56.240 --> 51:58.800]  It's just true. I just shoot him out of the Warthog so I can get in.
[51:58.960 --> 52:03.120]  And I know that there's a button to get him out. It's just, it's Halo. It's not real.
[52:04.300 --> 52:08.060]  I'm not, I wasn't really even concerned about his life. I was more upset by the fact that he was
[52:08.060 --> 52:11.920]  like calling out that they should murder a monkey in a kid's movie. Like he's trying to solve plot
[52:11.920 --> 52:19.080]  problems of MVP 2. It's not murder. It's murder. It's a monkey. It's a living creature.
[52:19.520 --> 52:23.760]  It's cruelty to animals. It's not murder. Is it murder? You can't murder an animal.
[52:24.020 --> 52:28.760]  Of course you can murder an animal. Well, yeah. No, I think he has a point actually.
[52:29.080 --> 52:31.780]  All right. I'm Googling it. You tell your fucking, you tell,
[52:31.900 --> 52:35.100]  do you tell how, tell me about how, how you became a skateboarder while I Google it.
[52:35.120 --> 52:39.400]  Let me say this. I love animals. I am not saying let's kill animals. I'm just saying
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.300]  to frame a monkey seems pretty convoluted. Damn it.
[52:44.480 --> 52:47.640]  You're saying this very confidently though. It's a little alarming.
[52:48.100 --> 52:52.580]  Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without jurisdiction or valid excuse,
[52:52.720 --> 52:59.140]  especially the un... jurisdiction, homicide, manslaughter. I'm looking for animals. Hold on.
[52:59.400 --> 53:03.760]  Damn it. All right. Well, maybe it's not murder. It's yeah, but it's definitely,
[53:03.760 --> 53:07.900]  it's definitely, definitely wrong. Yeah. It's super wrong.
[53:09.340 --> 53:15.180]  It's still killing. Sure. Anyway, this monkey was homeless and he didn't know how to skateboard and
[53:15.180 --> 53:19.060]  he learned how to skateboard. He was immediately doing kickflips. How did he get a skateboard if
[53:19.060 --> 53:23.140]  he was homeless? He met another kid that was homeless and he liked to skateboard and he
[53:23.140 --> 53:27.140]  took the kid's board and then he immediately started doing kickflips. And then the guy that
[53:27.140 --> 53:31.220]  was in home improvement that wasn't Tim Allen helped them and gave them skateboards.
[53:31.220 --> 53:37.600]  The guy that sells garden hoses on TV? Al? Yeah, I'm assuming him. Yeah. The other like lead.
[53:38.380 --> 53:42.440]  Al? Yeah. Anyway, I was convinced that if a monkey could skateboard immediately,
[53:42.680 --> 53:46.520]  then there's no way I wouldn't be immediately good at it. And the only knowledge I had was
[53:46.520 --> 53:51.980]  Tony Hawk and MVP2. And I really pushed my parents to buy me a skateboard. And my dad
[53:51.980 --> 53:56.740]  knew my motivation. And I remember him yelling at me, just because that goddamn monkey can
[53:56.740 --> 54:01.760]  skateboard doesn't mean you can. And I responded like, yeah, of course, obviously. But deep down,
[54:01.780 --> 54:05.660]  I was like, there's no way this monkey can skateboard and I can't. So I got a skateboard.
[54:06.140 --> 54:11.060]  And all I knew was like Tony Hawk and MVP2. And you know, Tony Hawk, like you stand and then you
[54:11.060 --> 54:16.180]  like kick the board down and go like that's how you move in Tony Hawk. Yeah, that's how I wanted
[54:16.180 --> 54:20.180]  to go. I got up on a ramp. And there were like maybe 10 other skateboarders there. And it became
[54:20.180 --> 54:24.300]  like an event like they're all behind me. They knew like I'd never skated before. Wait, you'd
[54:24.300 --> 54:29.040]  never skated before and you dropped in on a like a half pipe or a... No, no, no, no. It's like a
[54:29.040 --> 54:33.220]  small ramp. It was like an incline. Maybe ramp ramp might be generous, but it was an incline that
[54:33.220 --> 54:37.120]  you'd like go down to generate speed so you could go through the rest of the course that was built.
[54:37.500 --> 54:44.640]  That what they call them course tracks. I don't know skateboard terminology. Yeah. Park. I shot
[54:44.640 --> 54:51.460]  twice and I missed both times. Anyway, I had the board tilted like in Tony Hawk and I was explaining
[54:51.460 --> 54:54.800]  what I was going to do. And the guy just kept saying, you don't, that's way harder than if
[54:54.800 --> 54:58.540]  you just put the board down and then push. I'm like, no, this is how they do it in Tony Hawk.
[54:58.580 --> 55:02.640]  So this must be the way they do it. And I've seen a monkey do this. It can't be that hard.
[55:03.040 --> 55:09.000]  I made it like halfway down. I fell. My foot stayed on the board and I did like the splits
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.320]  and immediately started crying. I was bawling my eyes out. And then the park was like, oh,
[55:15.340 --> 55:19.520]  and then they started laughing. And then I walked home and I never touched a skateboard again. That
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.300]  was the end of my career. I realized I couldn't just because a monkey could do it does not mean.
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.580]  I can't believe you gave up. You could have been. There's an alternate timeline where you are one
[55:28.580 --> 55:33.680]  of the most famous skaters alive. It's true. And you just gave up because you didn't beat the
[55:33.680 --> 55:37.320]  monkey. Could you imagine how sad it would be, though, if I was like Tony Hawk and I credited
[55:37.320 --> 55:42.900]  it all to a monkey movie? That'd be awesome. Your story actually would be a lot better, Andrew. See,
[55:42.940 --> 55:46.840]  the way it would have worked is you'd have become a professional skateboarder, a la Bob Bernquist.
[55:46.840 --> 55:51.020]  And when people would ask you about your inspiration, you would talk about this movie
[55:51.020 --> 55:55.960]  MVP. Then eventually you would become so famous that you would get to reboot the franchise,
[55:56.340 --> 56:01.900]  a la Space Jam. And then you could be the Bob Bernquist of MVP, the reboot. And you would have
[56:01.900 --> 56:07.480]  been a fucking movie star who got to hang out with a monkey and be an amazing skateboarder to boot.
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.300]  And you you blew it. You were right there. To be fair, if it was a reboot these days,
[56:13.300 --> 56:19.360]  it would be a CG monkey. That's true. That's a great point. Yeah. Thank you,
[56:19.380 --> 56:22.480]  Gavin. You made me feel better about this. That's fair. That's an excellent point. Damn.
[56:22.660 --> 56:25.380]  I hope Jack is still alive. That's the name of the monkey, by the way.
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.540]  What was that monkey movie with Jason Alexander? Dunstan Checks In.
[56:30.740 --> 56:34.260]  Oh, that's a good movie. That's a great fucking movie. That's a good monkey movie.
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.720]  That is one of the best monkey movies. All the doorknobs are in the middle of the door. Love
[56:43.520 --> 56:50.080]  it. I want to go watch Dunstan Checks In. We should watch it together. Yeah. All right. Let's
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.320]  stop doing this. Let's go do that. You want to end the podcast? Yeah. This is the part where Eric
[56:53.320 --> 56:57.320]  yells at me to end the podcast. OK. Without Eric here, I think he's probably in a meeting getting
[56:57.320 --> 57:03.120]  yelled at for something else. I'm going to try to get it. This concludes another episode of the
[57:03.120 --> 57:09.200]  F*** Face Podcast. I have been your host, Geoff Ramsey. And with me, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Frey.
[57:09.460 --> 57:14.380]  Nobody likes them, but that's OK. They continue to live in my shadow. That's fine. Thanks for
[57:14.380 --> 57:19.460]  listening. If you like it, please rate and review it on Apple Podcasts or Spotify Podcasts or
[57:19.460 --> 57:25.940]  whatever the fuck that is. And if you don't like it, still review it. Stick it to the man. Don't
[57:25.940 --> 57:31.780]  let them tell you that... I lost him. Yeah, so did I. This is the best intro or exit we've ever done.
[57:31.780 --> 57:38.360]  I'll be honest. I tried to distract him. I tried to distract him in the middle of him doing that.
[57:38.500 --> 57:43.320]  Oh, he's back. By calling his phone. And the moment I called him, his audio stopped.
[57:44.820 --> 57:51.940]  What just happened there? Did you not hear me at all? No. Yeah, you called me. I'm on my f***ing
[57:51.940 --> 57:56.200]  phone. So you called me. I just hit mute and I just kept going. It was brilliant.
[57:56.920 --> 58:04.600]  Oh, it was brilliant. Rate reviews on the f***ing thing. Tell everybody. F*** if I stop. Assholes.
