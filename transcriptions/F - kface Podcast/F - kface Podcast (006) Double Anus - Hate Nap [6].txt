[00:40.620 --> 00:42.300]  Let's start the podcast. Okay.
[00:43.740 --> 00:45.800]  Okay, you can start. Are we starting?
[00:46.040 --> 00:47.700]  Yeah, you can start. Oh, okay. Let's do it.
[00:47.820 --> 00:51.460]  Okay. Well, last week you blew in before we were all sat down. This time you said,
[00:51.680 --> 00:54.640]  let's start the podcast and then said nothing for 15 seconds.
[00:54.900 --> 00:58.600]  I was so anxious to step in and say something, but go ahead. You can start now.
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.520]  And that's the intro to episode... what is this? Seven, five, six? What episode is this?
[01:04.520 --> 01:09.380]  No, it's five. No, it's six. It's episode six. Is it six?
[01:09.880 --> 01:12.660]  I think it's six. Episode six of F*** Face,
[01:13.180 --> 01:18.720]  a podcast about feelings. My name is Geoff and I have lots of feelings. With me are two emotionally
[01:18.720 --> 01:25.340]  dead individuals, Gavin Free and Andrew Pinton. You guys are English and Canadian,
[01:25.480 --> 01:28.380]  respectively. That's how I know that. Only Americans really feel.
[01:29.420 --> 01:33.300]  You ever think about how crazy it is that our friendship, like this is the only time where
[01:33.300 --> 01:38.380]  we could be friends in human history. Just with the distance. Well, like how else would
[01:38.380 --> 01:42.900]  he? Geoff's in f***ing Texas. You're from England. I'm on an island in Canada.
[01:43.540 --> 01:47.760]  When else could we have been friends? Well, to be fair, Gavin lives about four
[01:47.760 --> 01:50.780]  miles, maybe three miles from me in Texas. Yeah, but that would have never happened
[01:50.780 --> 01:52.380]  without internet. It's true.
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.180]  Gavin just doesn't suddenly move to Austin if this is f***ing 1820. That doesn't happen.
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.500]  We would have been born, lived our entire lives and died without knowing that we even
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.080]  existed together. That's sad.
[02:03.220 --> 02:06.680]  Gavin, here's a question. Here's something I would like to know, because I don't know
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.540]  the answer to this, because I'm very old and I've met very many people in my life.
[02:11.440 --> 02:15.160]  Do you remember the first time we met in person, Gavin? Was it in New York?
[02:15.480 --> 02:17.720]  Yeah. I stood up.
[02:17.820 --> 02:25.360]  Well, what was it? It was an event for our company at the Kennedy Center or the Lincoln Center in...
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.100]  Lincoln Center, New York. It was a screening of season three.
[02:30.620 --> 02:32.680]  Of Red vs. Blue, which was a cartoon we made.
[02:32.940 --> 02:36.400]  Which I think you cut down slightly, because it was quite long. You did like a little cut down.
[02:37.140 --> 02:40.400]  And then someone in the community made me stand up in front of everyone,
[02:40.500 --> 02:44.460]  because I'd come all the way from England. And he gave me a little bowling trophy that said...
[02:44.460 --> 02:45.740]  How old were you?
[02:46.960 --> 02:47.980]  16 or 17.
[02:48.580 --> 02:49.660]  And you came with your dad.
[02:49.940 --> 02:53.200]  Yeah. My dad didn't come to the event because he wanted to walk around New York and that.
[02:53.820 --> 02:55.260]  But I got a bowling trophy.
[02:55.860 --> 02:58.160]  I'm not going to let you say what the... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:58.160 --> 03:03.240]  A guy in the community gave me a bowling trophy that he stuck like a doll dress on,
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.780]  and he had it engraved with furthest distance traveled. So I stood up,
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.860]  and some people in the crowd clapped, and he gave it to me. And you on the mic said,
[03:13.680 --> 03:15.020]  Gavin, your fly is down.
[03:16.560 --> 03:20.200]  I kind of remember that. But to be fair, I think your fly was down.
[03:20.420 --> 03:26.180]  It was down. But everyone looked at me and laughed, which is nightmare territory for me.
[03:26.180 --> 03:28.040]  Especially when you're 16.
[03:28.440 --> 03:31.820]  Yeah, I sat back down in my seat, sort of slunked down,
[03:32.060 --> 03:35.680]  so no one could even see the back of my head, and just waited for the world to move on.
[03:37.660 --> 03:42.120]  To be fair, there were only maybe 400 people in that room at the time.
[03:42.880 --> 03:45.640]  It's true. I've actually got that on video. I've got the whole thing.
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.020]  Do you really?
[03:46.280 --> 03:46.540]  Yeah.
[03:46.620 --> 03:49.340]  Oh, my God. You should put that up for the F*** Face Archive someday.
[03:51.020 --> 03:54.400]  So was at that moment, were you thinking, this guy's going to be my best friend someday?
[03:54.400 --> 03:58.420]  Yeah, I thought, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to befriend this guy.
[03:58.620 --> 04:01.180]  I treat it like a video game. You've got to get the bar up,
[04:01.560 --> 04:05.160]  and then he'll ask me to move in, and then he'll hire me.
[04:08.440 --> 04:10.440]  Andrew, do you remember the first time we met?
[04:10.640 --> 04:13.040]  Oh, God, I do. I do, unfortunately.
[04:13.460 --> 04:15.360]  I definitely don't. Was it in Seattle?
[04:15.740 --> 04:20.660]  It was in Seattle, and I was so nervous that I didn't introduce myself until day two.
[04:21.020 --> 04:24.040]  I was at the booth all day, day one, and I didn't say hi to anybody.
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.180]  It was a griffball booth, and I just played griffball all day.
[04:27.280 --> 04:30.980]  And I kept thinking, I shouldn't introduce myself. I don't know. It's just a good time.
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.880]  There are a lot of people. I don't want to just be in line and be like, hey, and not buy something.
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.680]  I had a lot of anxiety about it. And then halfway through the first day,
[04:41.920 --> 04:45.620]  the thing at the booth was a griffball tournament. You had this huge whiteboard,
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.520]  and I backed up, and I knocked the whiteboard over, and it made the loudest clack.
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.680]  And everybody working the booth just looked at me as I put the whiteboard back,
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.520]  and I was like, I'm taking an L on day one. We're going to have to come back to this day
[05:00.520 --> 05:06.200]  two is when I definitively decided that there was just no, I couldn't at that point.
[05:06.900 --> 05:10.300]  I think Caleb introduced me. I don't think I even ever actually did.
[05:11.440 --> 05:12.120]  I was nervous.
[05:12.580 --> 05:13.460]  It's scary, man.
[05:14.020 --> 05:14.860]  It's very scary.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.280]  How long had we known each other online at that point?
[05:18.280 --> 05:23.420]  Oh, that's a great question. Maybe eight months, nine months, wasn't that long.
[05:23.660 --> 05:26.560]  That's long enough. We were friendly at that point.
[05:26.940 --> 05:28.640]  Yeah, I guess. I mean, that's a fair point.
[05:29.820 --> 05:32.640]  Okay, next question. Do you guys remember meeting each other?
[05:32.940 --> 05:35.160]  I have absolutely no memory of that.
[05:35.180 --> 05:38.740]  No, no, because it was on probably a griffball game, I'd assume, like it wasn't...
[05:38.740 --> 05:39.200]  In person.
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.220]  In real life, though.
[05:40.220 --> 05:44.140]  Oh, in real life. Yeah, I do. I do remember the first time I met Gavin, actually.
[05:44.140 --> 05:44.540]  When was that?
[05:44.540 --> 05:49.680]  It was really uneventful, and it was pretty... we'd known each other a long time. I flew to
[05:49.680 --> 05:56.380]  Austin in like 2016. What year did Ray leave Achievement Hunter? Was it that year?
[05:56.980 --> 05:57.860]  2015, I think.
[05:58.240 --> 05:58.700]  2015.
[05:59.160 --> 06:00.260]  February of 2015.
[06:00.540 --> 06:05.320]  The only reason I remember that is because I booked like a last minute trip, not knowing
[06:05.320 --> 06:10.760]  anything, and then like a week later Ray announced he was leaving, and it was the week I was there.
[06:10.760 --> 06:16.840]  And I didn't have like... I was between jobs, I had like no budget, so I just followed Caleb
[06:16.840 --> 06:20.060]  everywhere he went, so I just happened to be there that entire week.
[06:20.300 --> 06:23.780]  That must have been a fun time for you to experience Ray's strategy.
[06:24.140 --> 06:24.380]  A lot.
[06:24.700 --> 06:26.620]  With our first high-profile quitting.
[06:26.920 --> 06:32.620]  I do remember meeting you now, actually. I remember having known you for, I don't know,
[06:32.680 --> 06:40.580]  what, almost a decade online. And I remember seeing you in the post-production room.
[06:41.020 --> 06:44.840]  I think talking to Caleb. But I didn't know what you looked like. I realized that after
[06:44.840 --> 06:48.880]  eight or so years of knowing you online, I had no idea what you looked like.
[06:49.240 --> 06:52.500]  And I looked in the room, I was like, I don't know who that is. And then I just
[06:52.500 --> 06:56.520]  continued my day, probably went home. And I don't think I found out it was you until the next day.
[06:56.540 --> 07:01.180]  I was like, shit, Andrew Panton's here? Damn! And then I got excited. But the first day,
[07:01.280 --> 07:02.580]  I just had no idea who you were.
[07:02.740 --> 07:06.760]  Yeah, I think our official meeting was you were in the side office that you had,
[07:06.960 --> 07:10.320]  and Caleb and I walked in and was like, hey, I'm Andrew Panton. And we shook hands,
[07:10.320 --> 07:11.980]  and that was it. Not much of a story.
[07:13.560 --> 07:15.340]  Yeah, I think that was the second day.
[07:17.740 --> 07:23.400]  That's awesome. Hey, happy Fourth of July. If you're listening to this, it's definitely not
[07:23.400 --> 07:27.760]  the Fourth of July, unless you're listening to it one year into the future as a very,
[07:27.980 --> 07:33.400]  very old and perfectly timed replay. Happy Fourth, guys! I know it's a big deal to
[07:33.400 --> 07:36.920]  Canada and to England, America's independence.
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.440]  It's England's favorite day. We love it.
[07:40.600 --> 07:46.000]  Fuck. I bet you guys do right now. I bet there's not a single person in England
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.380]  who's not fucking clicking their heels and fucking chuckling under their breath right now.
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.460]  Have you noticed that Eric has taken to tweeting shit about us while we're recording? Have you
[07:56.460 --> 07:57.200]  seen his newest tweet?
[07:57.540 --> 07:58.660]  No, I haven't. What did he say?
[07:58.860 --> 08:01.280]  He's bitching about us, like, right this second on Twitter.
[08:01.680 --> 08:07.020]  Eric, you want to hop on and sort of say that to our face, or what? I guess that's enough.
[08:07.040 --> 08:11.380]  Yeah, yeah, no, I was saying that somehow this show has devolved in six episodes
[08:11.380 --> 08:13.480]  from just not knowing how to...
[08:13.480 --> 08:14.840]  So you agree it's episode six?
[08:15.280 --> 08:17.280]  Yes, it is episode six.
[08:17.700 --> 08:22.560]  It's not just down to us, though, because usually, like for the other podcasts,
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.820]  the real podcasts that we make, you sort of say...
[08:24.820 --> 08:25.460]  We were once?
[08:25.780 --> 08:30.840]  Yeah, you sort of say, you know, go, or you give us, like, an action, or you give us a countdown,
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.940]  I tried to do that last week, and what happened? What happened last time?
[08:35.180 --> 08:36.920]  Failure in leadership is what happened.
[08:37.300 --> 08:42.080]  That's... I'm sorry, boss, did I fell apart on this one, or what?
[08:42.640 --> 08:43.680]  I'm the producer.
[08:44.680 --> 08:48.960]  I tried to tell you to go last week, and that turned into a whole fucking mess.
[08:49.260 --> 08:53.800]  Somehow in six episodes, this show has devolved into not knowing how to end and not knowing how
[08:53.800 --> 09:00.540]  to start now. Like, we've written stuff out to be like, hey, just say this, and I've written
[09:00.540 --> 09:03.680]  things out for the end to just be like, yeah, say this, and then you're like, yeah, great,
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.360]  and then it turns into whatever this is, to where this time, I was afraid to say, okay,
[09:09.860 --> 09:14.480]  go, because you said, let's start the podcast, and then didn't say anything.
[09:14.680 --> 09:17.760]  You should never be afraid to do your job, but let me ask you a question, Eric,
[09:18.300 --> 09:22.960]  since you brought it up. You said that this podcast has... we have difficulty starting and
[09:22.960 --> 09:28.640]  stopping it. It's descended into a mess. Do you have that problem with any of the other podcasts
[09:28.640 --> 09:29.400]  you produce?
[09:30.120 --> 09:32.820]  Facejam doesn't know how to end, but it knows how to start.
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.760]  So what is it you think you're doing wrong here? You get it right everywhere else,
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.220]  but you can't get it together here. Where do you think it's a combination?
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.960]  You know what I think maybe is happening? I think maybe five minutes before we're supposed
[09:49.960 --> 09:55.420]  to record, one person messages me on Slack and goes, hey, funny story, and it's not a funny
[09:55.420 --> 10:01.200]  story. It's just a lot of technical problems. And so we had, I had to scramble, get out of a
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.840]  meeting and scramble to look at the rest of my week, the day that we're supposed to have off
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.500]  tomorrow. I'm like, all right, maybe we can record two episodes tomorrow to make up for the one that
[10:10.500 --> 10:14.920]  we're going to miss today. So that way we don't have to do it next week. Because if Geoff's gone
[10:15.420 --> 10:18.480]  and you're like, oh, I'll just bring, I can bring my tech on the road,
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.420]  which is fucking insane because it doesn't even work at your fucking house.
[10:22.560 --> 10:24.160]  I totally agree.
[10:24.160 --> 10:32.220]  Insane. Nuts. So I would think that the common thread here isn't the me of what the problem is.
[10:32.540 --> 10:33.580]  That's how I feel.
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.280]  Shit, shit rolls uphill, but only uphill to producer, never up to executive producer.
[10:39.520 --> 10:40.720]  Yep. Yep.
[10:41.660 --> 10:46.660]  That, you know, it's funny you mentioned that, Eric, that I texted you with, hey, I'm having a
[10:46.660 --> 10:52.540]  funny story. I'm having tech problems because Rooster Teeth, our company, faced me in the
[10:52.540 --> 10:57.780]  process of recording this episode. And it was quite frustrating and sort of hilarious,
[10:57.780 --> 11:02.020]  but we got it all worked out. And Andrew, you don't know this. I called Gavin to yell at him
[11:02.020 --> 11:06.240]  about it while I was fixing my computer. I would like to point out that I was in no
[11:06.240 --> 11:08.500]  way involved in any of this. I just received a phone call.
[11:08.700 --> 11:10.700]  No, you just, I just had to vent to you. Yeah.
[11:11.140 --> 11:16.120]  I said, can I call? And you go, yeah. And I go, okay, good. Here's what's happening.
[11:17.540 --> 11:20.900]  Well, it's because I know you're a very busy person, Gavin and Andrew, you're,
[11:20.900 --> 11:29.040]  you know, not. And so what did I do? Nothing. Most days, nothing. That's why I wasn't worried
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.440]  about your time. I was more concerned about Gavin's time. But here's what happened. I was
[11:34.440 --> 11:41.520]  recording audio for this other show we do. That's like a mini golf challenge and we have to do VO
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.760]  for it. And it's, it's particularly difficult because it's two people doing VO while syncing
[11:46.760 --> 11:51.620]  up watching a video and they're short clips, maybe 20, 30, 40 seconds. And, uh, I've been
[11:51.620 --> 11:56.600]  having to do that twice a week for the last six weeks or something. And, uh, it's, it's a different
[11:56.600 --> 12:02.560]  kind of annoying nightmare every time. And it's usually my fault. I will fully admit that like
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.500]  95% of the tech problems I encounter. And according to Eric, I encounter 95% more tech problems than
[12:08.500 --> 12:13.380]  the rest of the company combined are my fault. It's always my fault. I have bad luck and I make
[12:13.380 --> 12:18.280]  poor decisions in the moment. Like you have that moment where you're like, all right, something's
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.660]  going wrong. How do I, how do I, how do I eject from this problem? Or how do I, how do I right
[12:23.660 --> 12:27.740]  the ship? I always go left when I'm supposed to go right. I don't know what it is. Uh, and even
[12:27.740 --> 12:32.000]  sometimes I have the, I have the prescience to think like something's probably going to break
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.300]  and I'm going to have the instinct to go left. Don't follow my instincts, go right. And that's
[12:37.300 --> 12:41.980]  the time that, uh, I was supposed to go left. Actually it's a hundred percent. I fuck it up.
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.460]  But so before I went to record the audio for this, uh, for the mini golf thing this week,
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.400]  you guys sent me a new microphone because the mic I'm recording on right now, uh, is a doo-doo mic.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.560]  And so, uh, and we've been having problems with it. So I switched to the new microphone, which requires
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.460]  like a little, like the Scarlet amp and it's a whole new thing. And I get it all set up. It takes
[13:03.460 --> 13:07.880]  me like an hour to get it all set before the recording session, get it all set up perfectly.
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.220]  It's awesome. I finally can control my gain and do, uh, and I'm a very happy, successfully set
[13:14.220 --> 13:19.180]  up technologically, uh, little boy. And, uh, and the first thing they do is they go, hey,
[13:19.200 --> 13:22.200]  your mic sounds different. And I go, oh yeah, I switched to the new mic you guys sent me. And
[13:22.200 --> 13:27.520]  they go, oh yeah, don't do that. You shouldn't switch mics halfway through, uh, recording a show
[13:27.520 --> 13:33.200]  because the audio won't match, which I understand. However, maybe don't send me the mic and tell me
[13:33.200 --> 13:38.760]  to set it up regardless. I have to tear the new mic out and put the old mic back in, which takes
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.980]  forever and cuts into the recording time. I go, are we good to go? Does it sound good? They go,
[13:43.060 --> 13:47.580]  yeah, sounds great. Record the whole fucking thing. And then I found out 10 minutes before
[13:47.580 --> 13:52.140]  today's podcast, two days later, they come to me and they go, Hey, by the way, all of that audio
[13:52.140 --> 13:56.960]  was bad. The mic was fucked up the whole time, the hour and a half you spent on Monday evening
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.540]  or whatever it was recording all that audio. Uh, it's all just dog shit. And I, and I was like,
[14:03.640 --> 14:08.580]  but I'm supposed to record two podcasts. Cause we're going to go back to back here in 10 minutes.
[14:08.580 --> 14:13.240]  And they go, yeah, you're going to need to fix that. Hop on a call with me. I go to load up
[14:13.240 --> 14:17.660]  my computer and it's acting slow. And I go to reboot it. Rebooting it forces a fucking 30
[14:17.660 --> 14:22.820]  minute update. I have to go through the update. Then I finally get in, fix the mic. And here we
[14:22.820 --> 14:29.100]  are. I'll be honest. Your technical problems are an absolute joy to be around. Like you get
[14:29.100 --> 14:34.720]  frustrated in a way that is always so funny to me. I actually have a video that I took of you on a
[14:34.720 --> 14:45.600]  plane once where, where you were trying to untangle your headphones. And the video is like eight
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.820]  minutes long. If you scrub through, like you can scrub from the first frame to the last frame.
[14:50.820 --> 14:57.960]  It's way more tangled at the end. Did I know you were recording or was it like a secret recording?
[14:58.140 --> 15:02.460]  No, you knew I was recording. Oh man. I'm scared. Cause you lived with me for a long time. I'm
[15:02.460 --> 15:06.000]  scared about how many recordings you have. I don't know about. I think you'd know about all of them.
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.720]  I think, I mean, you might not remember him cause you were drunk for some of them, but I'm always,
[15:11.880 --> 15:17.720]  you know, in your face filming it. Yeah. Can I ask a production question? Yeah. Your new mic
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.640]  in theory would sound better than the old mic, right? Oh, a hundred percent. Big time better.
[15:22.900 --> 15:28.180]  Way better. So why wouldn't you want better audio the rest of the way than maintain with worse
[15:28.180 --> 15:33.780]  audio? Uh, I don't know. I mean, we were, it was within the same episode. So like we had recorded
[15:33.780 --> 15:38.780]  half of episode six and then we needed to record the back half of episode six. And also it is,
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.440]  generally it's, it's not a good idea. I get that. I understand the fault, the logic behind it,
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.200]  but I was literally in the recording session going, we're running out of time. Please don't
[15:47.200 --> 15:50.920]  make me do this. I think it's going to be a bad idea. I don't have good luck with this stuff.
[15:51.160 --> 15:56.000]  And they're like, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. It wasn't fine. And now next Monday I get to
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.820]  rerecord all of that audio again. I just can't see anyone leaving a comment saying like,
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.100]  this is bullshit. He sounded great halfway through. Why does Geoff sound better at the
[16:05.100 --> 16:09.880]  second half? How dare they make him sound better halfway through this episode? I listened to
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.700]  episode five and episode six and six was way better than five. And I don't like it.
[16:13.700 --> 16:19.620]  Can you let us know secretly, which, uh, like when you're rerecording it, can you like slip in a
[16:19.620 --> 16:24.200]  word so that we know that it's from that recording that you're annoyed about and have to do again?
[16:25.180 --> 16:25.980]  Yeah, well...
[16:25.980 --> 16:30.500]  Like slip in, slip in a buttholes in the middle of a sentence or something you wouldn't normally say.
[16:31.220 --> 16:36.240]  Well, I spent a lot of, it was a, an episode that was heavy. Uh, well, I don't want to give any
[16:36.240 --> 16:41.900]  spoilers. Shit. I can't, I can't give any spoilers. Yeah. I would love to tell you,
[16:41.900 --> 16:47.160]  I made a bunch of really mean specific jokes because I was angry, but I can't talk about them
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.460]  because even saying who the jokes are about, which would never get used by the way, but even saying
[16:52.460 --> 16:58.280]  who the jokes are about, uh, would, uh, provide unintentional spoilers for the, the mini golf
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.360]  tournament. And I don't want to do that. Damn, that's fair. But yeah, I'll figure out something.
[17:02.460 --> 17:06.340]  I'll slip in something weird. Yeah. Slip in like a double anus or something that would,
[17:06.460 --> 17:10.560]  is definitely from this podcast and not from mini golf. I don't think he says double anus a lot.
[17:10.560 --> 17:13.900]  Like, I feel like that's something he said. Maybe you should say like, good job, Gavin,
[17:14.200 --> 17:19.240]  or Andrew, I appreciate you doing this with us. Or you're great. That'd be weird if he said,
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.100]  Andrew, I appreciate you doing this with us in a series that you're not in. You know, I'm just
[17:24.100 --> 17:29.620]  like, that'd be clearly like a nod. There's no double anus Geoff says all the time. I think it's
[17:29.620 --> 17:33.640]  a terrible example. It's like, and I'm just going to use a name. I'm not saying that he's still in
[17:33.640 --> 17:37.900]  the tournament, but like, and Trevor steps up to the third hole. And as he lines up the putt,
[17:37.900 --> 17:42.700]  Andrew Panton has been a tremendous help on the podcast we record every Wednesday,
[17:43.380 --> 17:47.280]  and it's a, oh, and he misses. He's got it in two. Oh, that shot was a double anus.
[17:47.780 --> 17:53.520]  Double anus. I have, uh, speaking of double anus, I have found out recently from my girlfriend,
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.780]  who now makes fun of me mercilessly for it, when I get really mad at her and I get annoyed with her,
[17:58.860 --> 18:06.440]  which is fucking often, because she has found, she has an ability to push my buttons in a way
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.700]  that nobody in my entire life has been able to do. Like, and it's instant. She can like,
[18:11.820 --> 18:15.540]  she can annoy me so much, I shut down. I just like, I just like hug myself. And I'm like,
[18:15.580 --> 18:20.360]  just stop. I just can't. Please stop. I can't. I'm glad that someone, not that you finally found
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.880]  someone. I'm glad that someone has finally found you. Oh yeah. Because you deserve that more than
[18:24.880 --> 18:31.640]  anyone. Oh, Jesus. I've met my match far superior at annoying me than I am at her. But apparently
[18:31.640 --> 18:38.560]  when I get really mad at her, she says, I say under my breath, in a very, I guess it sounds
[18:38.560 --> 18:42.560]  like Napoleon Dynamite, which is weird, because I don't like that movie or that character at all.
[18:42.800 --> 18:49.060]  But apparently, when I get really pissed at her, under my breath, I go, anus. I guess that's my,
[18:49.180 --> 18:52.560]  like, I'm just really, I don't know I'm saying it. But every time I'll just be,
[18:53.140 --> 18:56.380]  I'll just be like, mumbling to myself and she'll go, anus? And I'm like,
[18:57.300 --> 19:03.860]  sort of. So that's, uh, oh, I love it. Yeah, let's get to know, I guess. That's how you know
[19:03.860 --> 19:08.000]  you've gotten under my skin. If I say anus to myself, that's me being really, really annoyed.
[19:09.260 --> 19:13.840]  Do you have an awareness that you're saying it? No, I don't realize it until after I've said it.
[19:14.020 --> 19:20.040]  That's weird. This episode is brought to you by Buffalo Trace Distillery. Powerful yet smooth.

[20:27.500 --> 20:33.460]  I have a... I'm a little worried about my brain lately. I don't remember who I was telling this
[20:33.460 --> 20:37.740]  to the other day, but I've been practicing this thing where I'm just having trouble focusing.
[20:38.720 --> 20:43.980]  And so I go for bike rides a lot. You know, I go like, I try to ride about 30 miles a day on my
[20:43.980 --> 20:49.220]  bicycle because it's like the only exercise that I can stomach because it feels like I'm playing,
[20:49.220 --> 20:54.720]  not exercising. And so I listen to music while I ride my bike. And I will all the time,
[20:55.440 --> 21:01.640]  because my mind just wanders and it gets annoying sometimes. I've been practicing starting a song
[21:02.220 --> 21:06.360]  on my playlist and then think, all right, I'm going to listen to this song and pay attention
[21:06.360 --> 21:10.220]  to this song from start to finish all the way through. That's all I'm going to do. I'm just
[21:10.220 --> 21:15.220]  going to listen to this Lana Del Rey song or Nina Simone or whatever the fuck I'm or like,
[21:15.220 --> 21:20.640]  I don't know, T Grizzley, whatever I'm listening to. And I'm just going to focus on the song and
[21:20.640 --> 21:24.240]  sing it in my head or just listen along and enjoy it and pay attention to the lyrics.
[21:24.560 --> 21:27.400]  And if I think about anything, I'll think about what the lyrics maybe they mean to the artist
[21:27.400 --> 21:32.720]  or whatever. And I'll go, OK, and I'll get and then I'll look up and there'll be four songs
[21:32.720 --> 21:36.840]  later and I'll be thinking about building a house in Montana. And I'll go like, what the fuck?
[21:37.160 --> 21:43.180]  And I can't ever get through one three or four minute song and maintain my focus the entire
[21:43.180 --> 21:50.780]  time, which is really frustrating and confusing. And I can't pinpoint when I lose focus because
[21:50.780 --> 21:55.520]  I lose it. And then I'll go like two or three songs later before I realize, oh, right, you were
[21:55.520 --> 22:01.060]  doing that fucking damn it again. Anybody else have that problem? Yeah, I mean, music definitely
[22:01.060 --> 22:04.000]  makes me just zone out and think about other things. I was trying to think while you were
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.240]  saying that I was trying to think of a song that would that would be a complete waste of time with
[22:08.240 --> 22:12.480]  like some songs have lyrics that they're absolutely pointless.
[22:12.780 --> 22:17.480]  Like I was I was listening to the lyrics of Tom Sawyer. What the hell is that song about?
[22:18.880 --> 22:22.880]  I would say anything by the band 311, which is Eric's favorite band, by the way,
[22:23.120 --> 22:29.860]  is pretty just nonsense. One night in Bangkok. I'm pretty sure that entire song is about chess.
[22:31.580 --> 22:37.380]  Is it? I was listening to the words. There's some absolutely insane sentences in that song.
[22:37.380 --> 22:44.580]  Such as? Tea girls, warm and sweet. Some are set up in the Somerset Morm suite.
[22:45.100 --> 22:50.100]  Do you know what a tea girl is? A girl that gives you tea?
[22:51.720 --> 22:59.020]  I'm pretty sure that song is about having sex with trans sex workers called I think it's a
[22:59.020 --> 23:04.500]  derogatory term now, but they were called ladyboys in Bangkok. I'm pretty sure it's a song about
[23:04.500 --> 23:09.880]  prostitution. OK, so they're warm and sweet, which is kind of like a chess game, maybe, you know?
[23:09.940 --> 23:16.560]  Yeah. OK, so maybe he's talking about sort of some sexual activities and chess because I'm
[23:16.560 --> 23:23.780]  pretty sure there's a bunch of chess related sentences. Andrew, care to weigh in on One
[23:23.780 --> 23:28.440]  Night in Bangkok? I'm the orangutan guy. I don't know if you want me to decipher
[23:29.240 --> 23:31.560]  the hidden meanings of anything, really.
[23:33.400 --> 23:38.120]  I'm bad with music. I don't listen to music. You don't listen to any music?
[23:38.500 --> 23:45.140]  No, not really. Just never did. Really? How about this? What was the first album you ever owned?
[23:45.320 --> 23:51.000]  Oh, I couldn't tell you that. I have no idea. No memory. I bought a lot of soundtracks. I bought
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.280]  the soundtrack for The Transporter. That was pretty good. It's probably the earliest soundtrack
[23:56.280 --> 24:01.300]  I remember buying. Jason Statham beats people up while covered in oil with bike pedals on his
[24:01.300 --> 24:05.920]  feet. Fantastic. Good movie. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know a lot about music. It's a definite
[24:05.920 --> 24:11.640]  hole for me. Just never grabbed you? Never. Yeah, just never. Yeah, never listened to it.
[24:11.940 --> 24:15.780]  I watched a lot of movies and games. That's quite a wide range of life to
[24:15.780 --> 24:19.240]  never have got involved with. Yeah, but I'm pretty deep in games,
[24:19.420 --> 24:23.700]  movies and sports. So I feel like I can make up for it in other ways. It's just, yeah, I never
[24:23.700 --> 24:30.500]  invested. If life was a skill tree, I completely skipped music. Didn't put any points in.
[24:30.500 --> 24:34.420]  Yeah, I guess I kind of skipped sports. Like, I used to watch Tottenham when I lived in England,
[24:34.560 --> 24:40.400]  but haven't done that for a while. Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant.
[24:40.940 --> 24:42.220]  Right? Okay.
[24:42.320 --> 24:46.720]  His reserve, a quiet defense, riding out the day's events, the river.
[24:48.180 --> 24:51.220]  So though his mind is not for rent, I interpret as...
[24:51.220 --> 24:55.440]  As that other things might be for rent. Uh-huh. Yeah, like apartments.
[24:56.180 --> 25:00.120]  Catch the witness, catch the wit, catch the spirit, catch the spit.
[25:01.320 --> 25:06.480]  What's he talking about? Catch the spit? Who's gauzing all over the place?
[25:07.120 --> 25:10.760]  Would you rather have a bottle of piss thrown at you or a bottle of spit?
[25:12.980 --> 25:16.040]  Probably... Probably because of the consistency, I'd say piss.
[25:16.360 --> 25:17.700]  Oh, definitely piss. Yeah, piss.
[25:17.700 --> 25:21.500]  It wouldn't slime. Well, it also, pee comes out sterile.
[25:22.040 --> 25:23.900]  A mouth is a dirty, dirty place. I don't think that's true.
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.780]  No, it's sterile in your body, and it's sterile the second it comes out. I mean,
[25:27.820 --> 25:30.760]  if it touches... Whatever it touches outside, it gets contaminated by.
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.440]  But your mouth is fucking gross. And, think about it, I could piss a gal in 18 seconds.
[25:36.780 --> 25:39.760]  You know how long it would take to spit enough to throw on somebody?
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.560]  That almost makes me respect it more, though. Like, that person was really committed
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.360]  to their plan. I agree, though. For me, it's simply the mouth travels.
[25:47.700 --> 25:51.320]  The dick doesn't really... No, it's not as... I don't know. It doesn't scare me as much.
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.460]  The dick doesn't travel? Well, it travels... Like, I kind of know
[25:54.460 --> 25:57.860]  where the dick is gonna go. It's not, like, going... Like, I don't know where the mouth...
[25:57.860 --> 26:02.020]  The mouth can go to a lot of places the dick can't. It's a much scarier place.
[26:03.780 --> 26:08.540]  I would like you to expound upon that, because I am intrigued.
[26:09.100 --> 26:10.700]  Well, like... Where do you think that the mouth...
[26:10.700 --> 26:12.900]  Where do you think that the penis doesn't go that the mouth does?
[26:14.960 --> 26:16.720]  I mean... I didn't think of it that... I mean,
[26:16.720 --> 26:21.160]  I don't know. You can... Food? You're not putting your dick in lasagna, most likely. I mean,
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.280]  someone probably has. I bet somebody does. I bet a lot of people...
[26:25.280 --> 26:29.740]  You're not gonna find food in urine. I would be willing to say that there is
[26:29.740 --> 26:34.960]  nowhere a mouth has been that a dick hasn't. I feel like... Whoa. Wait.
[26:35.260 --> 26:41.680]  Yeah. I'm with Gavin. I think that since the dawn of time, men have searched out interesting and
[26:41.680 --> 26:47.820]  new and weird things to put their penis in or on. Watermelon. Wonder what that's like. Lasagna.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.040]  Mound of dirt at a concert. I saw a video of a dude who started fucking a mound of
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.020]  dirt at a concert the other day. I would be willing to guess that the
[26:58.020 --> 27:02.140]  penis has done more than the mouth. Like, for example, Geoff, you once slammed your
[27:02.140 --> 27:06.300]  penis in a toilet seat. I don't think you ever slammed your mouth in one.
[27:06.560 --> 27:07.840]  No, that would hurt. Not once.
[27:11.700 --> 27:17.240]  That's a weird... I don't know what was going on there. I was like nine or eight.
[27:19.020 --> 27:22.580]  And I was taking a piss one day. And I was looking at the toilet seat. You know how,
[27:22.840 --> 27:28.280]  in the old days, now we have toilet seats that they catch themselves as they go down and they
[27:28.280 --> 27:35.520]  lower slowly. But a toilet seat used to, if you just let it drop, it would drop with the weight
[27:35.520 --> 27:41.180]  of seven bricks and it would go SLAM. And you'd hear your mom go like, stop slamming the toilet
[27:41.180 --> 27:45.140]  seat. And I remember I was just looking at the toilet seat one day after I peed when I was like
[27:45.140 --> 27:50.100]  eight. And I thought, I wonder what it would be like if I stuck my dick on the edge of the toilet
[27:50.500 --> 27:55.220]  and the toilet seat and I just let it slam down and hit me in the dick. And I did it.
[27:55.500 --> 27:57.560]  So did you have to like get down on your knees?
[27:58.060 --> 28:01.840]  Uh, yeah, I think I crouched a little bit. I don't think I was that tall. And I just kind of
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.500]  laid my dick on it. And then I went, all right, let's see what happens. And then I fucking just
[28:05.500 --> 28:10.700]  dropped it. I didn't slam it. I just dropped it and let gravity do it. And I think it was the
[28:10.700 --> 28:18.380]  first time in my life I ever saw stars like in a cartoon. Like in Bugs Bunny.
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.940]  And it wasn't from banging your head. It was from slamming your penis.
[28:21.620 --> 28:28.860]  It was a pain so intense and specific and unique that I had not felt yet. I remember everything
[28:28.860 --> 28:34.600]  got swimmy and there were like little starbursts. And I thought, this is, this is what Wile E.
[28:34.600 --> 28:41.180]  Coyote feels. The worst part is when I was like nine or ten, I was taking a piss one day
[28:41.180 --> 28:46.660]  in the bathroom and I thought, why did I do that? And then I thought, that was dumb. What did it
[28:46.660 --> 28:50.900]  feel like again? I thought, well, it mustn't have been that bad. Let me see. And I did it again.
[28:51.260 --> 28:53.100]  And it was just as bad the second time.
[28:53.420 --> 28:57.380]  It's sadistic. I don't know what you were expecting. You must have been expecting exactly
[28:57.380 --> 29:03.700]  that pain because, you know, you can like flick a penis or just like, like bash it on the corner
[29:03.700 --> 29:09.640]  of something and it kills. And that's nowhere near as hard as slamming a toilet seat on top of it.
[29:09.880 --> 29:13.720]  Yeah. Maybe I wanted a preview of what divorce felt was going to feel like when I was an adult
[29:13.720 --> 29:21.020]  or something. I don't know. I chalk it up the first time to like weird childhood curiosity.
[29:21.420 --> 29:24.360]  I cannot defend the second time. I have no idea why I did it again.
[29:24.680 --> 29:25.940]  But you haven't done it since.
[29:26.380 --> 29:26.580]  No.
[29:26.980 --> 29:28.560]  What, like three decades ago now?
[29:28.940 --> 29:29.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[29:29.780 --> 29:31.120]  I feel like you have to do it again.
[29:31.720 --> 29:36.380]  Like just for scientific purposes, just to see. I mean, the technology's changed. As you said,
[29:36.960 --> 29:38.480]  toilet seats don't fall like they used to.
[29:38.680 --> 29:39.340]  That's true.
[29:39.900 --> 29:43.200]  Imagine going into a random conversation, just be like, man, toilet seats don't fall
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.300]  like they used to. Am I right, guys? Like that's such an unrelatable experience.
[29:51.200 --> 29:56.160]  Hey, Andrew, I don't mean to change the subject, but you've been slacking me about hockey and
[29:56.160 --> 30:00.240]  I've been ignoring it because our friendship now is relegated to this podcast because I don't want
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.620]  anything to be spoiled for me. So what have you been slacking me about for the last week?
[30:05.760 --> 30:08.100]  Is it worth talking about here or is it not?
[30:08.580 --> 30:13.060]  It's not that. It's just the NHL fucking sucks and I hate that I'm a fan of a team that never
[30:13.060 --> 30:19.880]  wins and it's nothing but bad. That's all it is. They had their draft lottery and they
[30:19.880 --> 30:23.900]  structured their draft lottery in a way that teams playing in the playoffs could win the pick.
[30:24.440 --> 30:27.020]  And they're like, here are the teams that aren't going to play. We're going to have our lottery.
[30:27.020 --> 30:32.580]  None of them won first overall. The best they did was second. The team with the worst record
[30:32.580 --> 30:37.000]  in the league is picking third and fifth, the two worst picks they had. So one of the
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.200]  playoff teams is going to win first overall. It's stupid. All the teams in the playoffs
[30:41.200 --> 30:46.460]  have no reason to win. It's better if they lose. It's infuriating. It's just dumb.
[30:46.460 --> 30:47.820]  That sounds very frustrating.
[30:48.180 --> 30:49.340]  I hate hockey. I don't know why.
[30:49.420 --> 30:52.540]  Do you ever regret putting so many points in that skill tree?
[30:52.540 --> 30:57.620]  It's the worst decision I've ever made. It's one of the only times I've ever had a hate nap.
[30:58.080 --> 31:03.680]  It was dumb. When the Canucks had the second, I think they had the second or third worst
[31:03.680 --> 31:08.220]  record in the league and they lost to two teams that barely missed the playoffs and they picked
[31:08.220 --> 31:12.060]  fifth. I was so mad I just had to sleep. I had a nap. I didn't know how to handle it.
[31:12.340 --> 31:15.500]  The angriest maybe I've been in the last five years. Devastating.
[31:15.520 --> 31:16.980]  How did you feel when you woke up?
[31:17.400 --> 31:20.480]  Oh, I was totally fine. Hate naps, I highly recommend a good hate nap.
[31:20.800 --> 31:21.720]  Does that happen a lot for you?
[31:22.680 --> 31:30.360]  No, maybe twice. That was the first hate nap I've ever had. I'm so mad. I just need to literally
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.140]  turn off. But yeah, I'd recommend it. It's good.
[31:34.380 --> 31:39.880]  I don't know how you would get off though. If I was just livid, I wouldn't feel very sleepy.
[31:40.540 --> 31:44.780]  No, I guess. Yeah, I don't know. That's a good point. It's just I was so angry I
[31:44.780 --> 31:49.940]  needed to turn off so I forced it. I forced a good hour-long nap and it was great.
[31:49.940 --> 31:53.040]  Felt way better afterward. So I'd recommend it.
[31:53.200 --> 31:53.400]  Fair play.
[31:53.760 --> 31:56.840]  I could, I might, I might deal with a hate map.
[31:57.540 --> 32:03.060]  Hate map. My hate map would be large. A hate nap after my mic troubles today, actually.
[32:03.400 --> 32:08.320]  Based on how often you have tech problems, you'll be napping daily. It may just be a healthy thing.
[32:08.600 --> 32:12.880]  I don't know why. I don't know what it is, dude. I used to work at a call center,
[32:13.360 --> 32:17.100]  an internet tech support call center. It's where I met Bernie and Gus and we started Rooster Teeth.
[32:17.100 --> 32:23.880]  And I, I was the fastest person promoted through the tech center in the history of the company.
[32:24.440 --> 32:30.360]  And then I became a manager in like less than a year. And I managed like 200 people who were
[32:30.360 --> 32:37.440]  providing tech support, internet tech support, for five and a half years. And now I can't, I,
[32:37.700 --> 32:44.200]  I can't do anything. I can't do the most basic of things. I got so fucking stupid.
[32:44.200 --> 32:50.300]  I used to understand all kinds of stuff. And now I, I, I just, I'm, I'm just, I'm tech dumb.
[32:50.760 --> 32:53.680]  What's the dumbest solution you've had to a tech problem?
[32:54.080 --> 32:58.920]  Well, I haven't used a fire extinguisher yet. Still going. It still works great.
[32:59.360 --> 33:03.700]  Looking at it right now. I'm still in a pillow fort too. I never figured out.
[33:03.840 --> 33:06.340]  You're still in a pillow fort? Are you ever going to live in a normal room?
[33:06.640 --> 33:10.980]  No, that's a great question. I've been using shower curtains as like a blanket for like,
[33:10.980 --> 33:14.440]  how long? When did, like three weeks, two weeks, two and a half weeks.
[33:14.580 --> 33:18.060]  I need to figure out the echo thing in a more productive way.
[33:18.380 --> 33:24.600]  It is weird how you can lose tech savvy. Like Geoff, I was a witness to you doing stuff,
[33:24.920 --> 33:29.300]  like complex stuff at work. I watched you edit the podcast once.
[33:29.380 --> 33:32.160]  I can't imagine you even opening the program now.
[33:32.460 --> 33:38.620]  No, no, no, no, never. Editing is an interesting one because I completely self-taught, you know,
[33:38.620 --> 33:43.700]  as most of us on the internet are. I became a pretty adept editor, you know,
[33:43.720 --> 33:50.240]  because I edited Rooster Teeth content for probably 13 years. And then one day we got to a point where
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.140]  it just didn't make sense for us to edit. Like we could record and create more content than we
[33:55.140 --> 33:58.680]  could edit. And there were people, you know, Rooster Teeth grew to the point where we could
[33:58.680 --> 34:03.740]  hire editors that were specialized and much better at editing than us, which freed us up to be more
[34:03.740 --> 34:09.260]  creative and to create more projects. And the second I turned over my editing, I forgot everything
[34:09.260 --> 34:16.160]  I ever taught myself or knew. Like, I flushed it down the brain toilet in one second and never
[34:16.160 --> 34:21.080]  looked back. I wonder if there are other technical skills that you'll never forget. For example,
[34:22.020 --> 34:26.680]  you are like a god of head bobbing for machinima, like bobbing the heads up and down to audio. I
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.940]  bet you still have that if you had to do it. I do, I do, 100%. Yeah, I will go to my grave saying
[34:32.880 --> 34:39.940]  certain of a few things. One, that I was the greatest Peggle player of all time.
[34:40.720 --> 34:47.200]  Well... I may not be in Peggle fighting shape right now, but I could get back to it. Did you
[34:47.200 --> 34:55.320]  do that yin-yang level or did you get some help? Listen, Dickhead, we were a team, first of all.
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.800]  What Gavin's referring to is, there's this video game called Peggle, it's like a
[35:00.800 --> 35:06.960]  video game for bored housewives and dudes who just need something to do when they're on conference
[35:06.960 --> 35:12.360]  calls, but we became obsessed with it. And there were all these Xbox achievements tied to doing
[35:12.360 --> 35:17.960]  stuff and different ways you play it and stuff. And one of the hardest achievement, I remember it,
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.920]  like it was yesterday, it's called Doctor of the Peggle Arts. And that achievement is to clear
[35:21.920 --> 35:27.440]  every peg from every board on every map of Peggle, of which there are, I don't know,
[35:27.440 --> 35:31.520]  maybe a hundred, Gavin? And typically to beat a level in Peggle, you just have to get rid of the
[35:31.520 --> 35:36.660]  red pegs. The blue ones are just fodder, they're just points. It's very difficult to clear every
[35:36.660 --> 35:41.200]  single peg. Damn difficult. With the bonus difficulty of if you clear all the red pegs
[35:41.200 --> 35:47.940]  before the blue ones, the level ends. Yeah, yeah. And it's quite hard sometimes to not hit
[35:47.940 --> 35:54.520]  the red ones when you're trying not to. So it took us about four years, me, you, and my ex-wife,
[35:54.520 --> 36:00.380]  of intense Peggle playing, and we finally beat it. And you definitely beat the level that is
[36:00.380 --> 36:05.060]  my Kryptonite, Yin-Yang, and I have never beaten that level. I tried again a couple years later,
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.800]  and I've still never beaten it. But I beat so many levels that you and my ex-wife could not beat.
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.160]  So you're saying Gavin is the Pippin to your Jordan, is what you're saying? Yes, 100%, 100%.
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.340]  You needed him to get over the mountain, but... And then Peggle 2 came out, and I did all that
[36:20.340 --> 36:25.520]  shit by myself. And Peggle 2 was a lot harder than Peggle 1, and I have no idea about your
[36:25.520 --> 36:29.240]  prowess in Peggle 2, because I didn't see it. But I'm very confident in my abilities.
[36:29.400 --> 36:31.660]  Yeah, so it drifted off. Was it really harder than Peggle 1?
[36:31.900 --> 36:35.860]  I think so. The achievements, I mean, I don't think that there was a Doctor of the Peggle
[36:35.860 --> 36:41.960]  Arts-style clear every peg achievement, but some of the stuff you had to do was quite difficult.
[36:42.220 --> 36:46.360]  Yeah, they had some really unique and frustrating and difficult achievements in it. But anyway,
[36:46.360 --> 36:50.860]  there's that. I will go to my grave knowing that I'm the best Peggle player in the world,
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.620]  and I will go to my grave knowing I'm the best head bobber of all time. I'm the Michael Jordan
[36:56.200 --> 37:03.440]  and, like, meets Miradonna of head bobbing.
[37:04.140 --> 37:08.600]  And we've got Andrew Panton, who's clearly the best Garfield cart.
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.200]  Yeah, undeniably. Best in the universe. Has anybody beaten your times yet?
[37:13.660 --> 37:18.620]  Like, there are two times that have been... I had this fucking guy DM me. I don't think he knows
[37:18.620 --> 37:23.100]  anything about the podcast or anything. I think he just found that I had Garfield... I think I had
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.580]  world's best Garfield cart player in my Twitter bio, and he messaged me like, hey, I read your
[37:29.580 --> 37:36.020]  bio, you know, and you need to change it, because what you're playing is Garfield cart 2, and I
[37:36.020 --> 37:42.080]  have all the records in Garfield cart 1, and my times are faster than yours, and I'm sure, you
[37:42.080 --> 37:46.540]  do still have the times. I don't know what you're doing in Garfield cart 2, but, you know, you'd
[37:46.540 --> 37:52.140]  probably be trash if you played Garfield cart 1. Fucking psycho. It's a psycho. Did it make you
[37:52.140 --> 37:56.480]  want to play Garfield cart 1? No, fuck him. I looked at his times. He's skipping. He's jumping
[37:56.480 --> 38:02.580]  through walls. He's cheating. It's ridiculous. Fuck that guy. Don't... like, I'm sure he's a
[38:02.580 --> 38:09.100]  great guy, but fuck that guy. Garfield 1, it's a fucking... it's a bullshit game. It barely works.
[38:09.100 --> 38:13.980]  He's jumping through walls. Could you imagine if one guy's like, I got the home run record, and
[38:13.980 --> 38:17.760]  also I did all the steroids. Here's video of it. Like, what do you mean you're bragging about your
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.300]  record? You're cheating. Yeah, it's Barry Bonds, dude. Yeah, I know, but Barry Bonds wasn't like,
[38:22.380 --> 38:27.020]  hey, look at all this video of me injecting steroids. He just did the thing. This guy's
[38:27.020 --> 38:31.240]  video is him cheating. 15 tracks. He's like, the only track I don't have I gave to my brother.
[38:31.520 --> 38:34.880]  Like, fucking, you're jumping through walls. What are you talking about? You're sounding
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.580]  slightly defensive. He sounds a little defensive. I'm not defensive. I'm just, I'm angry that the
[38:39.580 --> 38:43.000]  guy would reach out. So I doubled down and I said I'm the best Garfield Kart player in the
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.500]  fucking galaxy. I didn't respond. I just changed my bio to be wider for how great I am. Look,
[38:48.520 --> 38:53.860]  if you need to take a little hate nap right now, we can wait. I'd love to. Can we do this in like
[38:53.860 --> 38:58.980]  an hour? Yeah, can we come back in an hour? That'd be great. Just let me take down my fucking pillow
[38:58.980 --> 39:06.240]  fort so I can have a nice nap. I'm reading your bio now. Undisputed best Garfield Kart player in
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.400]  the galaxy. Yeah, I changed it because it's like, fuck that guy. I didn't want to respond. Oh,
[39:10.500 --> 39:15.500]  you, you've got a f*** face in your bio. I do. Well, why wouldn't I? That's a good point. Yeah,
[39:15.500 --> 39:19.000]  that's a good point. I guess I should probably do that. I wouldn't think to put, like,
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.340]  a specific Rooster Teeth production in my bio, but yeah, maybe I'll put a f*** face. Well,
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.180]  not everybody gets to be in every production like you, Gavin. That's true. I'm not even in
[39:28.180 --> 39:32.740]  half of them these days. Yeah, I used to be my Twitch channel. I don't really, like, I did that
[39:32.740 --> 39:36.660]  once. That was like a thing I did. So there's no real points. I was like, I should put something
[39:36.660 --> 39:41.960]  more relevant. Was that back when you were doing the, uh, you were earning chicken dinners? Yeah.
[39:42.180 --> 39:47.840]  To eat in real life? That's a fantastic story. Can you tell that story? I, uh, I played PUBG
[39:48.320 --> 39:53.820]  for a month and I decided that I could only eat chicken dinners and I can only eat dinners I
[39:53.820 --> 39:58.700]  earned in the game. So if I got a win, when you win in PUBG, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,
[39:59.280 --> 40:02.840]  uh, you get a message at the end that says winner, winner, chicken dinner, which is a phrase I
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.900]  f***ing hate. I hate it. Can't stand it. Never liked it. Had a resurgence in, like, the mid-2000s
[40:07.900 --> 40:11.660]  with that poker movie. I don't know if you remember 21, but that was the tagline in that
[40:11.660 --> 40:15.060]  movie and it became popular. Had, like, Jesse Eisenberg, right? Or one of the kids? Don't
[40:15.060 --> 40:18.680]  think he was in it. You want to take another shot? Not in the movie. You want to go again?
[40:19.020 --> 40:22.520]  So this is bad. There's a problematic actor in that movie. I'll give you a clue.
[40:23.680 --> 40:24.680]  Problematic. Spacey?
[40:25.280 --> 40:27.540]  Yeah, there you go. Yeah, yeah, it was Spacey. That's right.
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.260]  And the guy that was in the fake Beatles movie. He's also in it. Anyway, tagline was winner,
[40:33.300 --> 40:37.060]  winner, chicken dinner. I hate the phrase. It made it popular. Came back for PlayerUnknown's
[40:38.020 --> 40:41.060]  Battlegrounds. I was thinking one day, like, what if you actually got a chicken dinner?
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.740]  So then I kind of pitched it to you, Geoff, and I told a few friends that I was going to do it.
[40:46.220 --> 40:48.940]  And I didn't really think I was going to do it. And then, like, two days before,
[40:48.940 --> 40:53.220]  I picked February to be the month, to see if I could go a month, because it was the shortest month.
[40:53.740 --> 40:56.720]  And like two days before February, I had a friend say, like, so you're going to do that, right?
[40:57.120 --> 41:02.160]  I kind of hoped everybody would forget about it. And then I did it. I streamed every day. I'd never
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.600]  streamed before, but then I would stream every day me playing PUBG at night, trying to get chicken
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.480]  dinner wins. And so the way it works is, in PUBG, it's called PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,
[41:11.500 --> 41:16.100]  and it's a battle royale video game, which basically, it's like that movie, that Japanese
[41:16.100 --> 41:21.840]  movie. There's an island in the video game, and everybody comes in and like paratroops down onto
[41:21.840 --> 41:27.540]  the island with just your fists. And then you rummage around and you find guns and armor and
[41:27.540 --> 41:32.860]  shit. And then you all kill each other until it goes from 100 people down to one. And that's how
[41:32.860 --> 41:37.160]  you win. You'd be the last of 100 people left alive. So the way you had it set up was you could
[41:37.160 --> 41:44.280]  only eat real food if you won in PUBG. And you'd have to play over and over and over again until
[41:44.280 --> 41:49.440]  you got a win. And then you could only eat an actual chicken dinner for how many days? 28 days.
[41:49.640 --> 41:53.760]  28 days. Month of February. And that's not super easy. Like to win in PUBG, I feel like if I was
[41:53.760 --> 42:00.380]  doing that, I would have starved to death. Pretty quickly. I wouldn't have made it. I'm gifted in
[42:00.380 --> 42:06.120]  the sense that I am delusional with a lot of that type of stuff. And I thought, no problem. As soon
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.500]  as I figured like, okay, first few days going to be rough. I get to that weekend, get five or six
[42:10.500 --> 42:15.380]  wins, and I can just roll from there. I don't think I ever won more than twice on any day.
[42:15.700 --> 42:22.040]  So it was terrible. You were at least net positive on like meals per day though. Yeah, it was never
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.720]  a problem of like not having food, but a constant concern of what if I ran out? Like I just can't
[42:26.720 --> 42:32.200]  have a losing streak. Because you never built enough of a cushion to feel safe. But did you
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.900]  ever go without a meal in any one of the 28 days? No, there's never a point where I wanted food and
[42:37.900 --> 42:43.320]  couldn't get to it. But it was bad. Were you worried though? Were you close? Constantly.
[42:43.700 --> 42:49.320]  I've been playing seven hours and I still haven't won yet. And I'm so hungry. No, it wasn't like
[42:49.320 --> 42:54.020]  that. No, I always had a reserve going, but it was a constant fear of like, fuck, I need to keep
[42:54.020 --> 42:59.640]  winning. I'm not great at this. Like I maybe get one win a night. I need to keep winning. Yeah,
[42:59.660 --> 43:05.220]  I guess you just didn't want to bitch out like you did with the McDonald's hamburger challenge.
[43:05.700 --> 43:11.340]  We'll get to that. We'll get to that another time. Let's talk about that next episode,
[43:11.420 --> 43:15.100]  because I want to hear about that too. Yeah, it sucked. You would think like I
[43:15.100 --> 43:19.400]  went in thinking like, okay, pooping is going to be a problem. Just being bored of food is going
[43:19.400 --> 43:24.880]  to be a problem. But it was like just the mental aspect of it was way worse. It was so draining.
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.820]  Sucked. Would not recommend. But you did it and you had the reward of,
[43:31.820 --> 43:38.800]  uh, I don't know. Knowing you did it, I guess. Yeah, I did it. It's a dumb thing. It's a story
[43:38.800 --> 43:44.160]  that I get to talk about on F*** Face. That was the ultimate reward. As mentioned in your Twitter
[43:44.160 --> 43:49.700]  bio. As mentioned in my Twitter bio. I saw you put your Sea of Thieves footage up on Twitter. I
[43:49.700 --> 43:54.320]  watched it. Oh yeah? What do you think? Pretty good moves, right? Pretty good moves. Pretty
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.300]  funny. You should start a thread on your Twitter so that every time someone listens to a F*** Face,
[43:59.300 --> 44:05.080]  we can just go to your Twitter and sort of see the long list of clips that go with your stories.
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.620]  Because you do document your stuff pretty well. Yeah, I was thinking about doing that. Of like
[44:09.620 --> 44:15.660]  doing a companion type tweet. Like if I have stuff that applies to the episode. Or we could just make
[44:15.660 --> 44:20.940]  a F*** Face Twitter account and put them there. Andrew, have you ever talked about that bet you
[44:20.940 --> 44:26.680]  did recently to see who could step the least in 24 hours? No. Have we talked about that on F*** Face?
[44:26.680 --> 44:31.840]  No, we haven't. Okay, here's what we should do. Let's stop this podcast. Let's quit this F*** podcast
[44:31.840 --> 44:37.560]  because I'm sick of it. So that we can immediately start the next podcast and talk about your
[44:37.560 --> 44:41.740]  McDonald's thing and the stepping thing. And I still didn't get to the thing I wanted to show
[44:41.740 --> 44:47.220]  you guys because I got off on a whole tangent about my dick or whatever. Are we in the second one now?
[44:47.540 --> 44:51.080]  No, we haven't started the second one yet. We have to end the first one. Okay. How would we know
[44:51.080 --> 44:56.320]  That'd be a good way to end it. Let me do it. Check it out.
[44:57.200 --> 45:05.000]  Wow, thanks for listening to F*** Face. It's a podcast about friendship and how magic...
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.580]  That's a Care Bear story. Do you like a Krusty the Klan thing? Yeah, there you go. And wow,
[45:11.860 --> 45:16.600]  what a... I learned a little bit. I hope you did too. If you didn't, that's okay. Not every day
[45:16.600 --> 45:21.860]  needs to be a school day as long as you were slightly entertained. And man, gee, I really
[45:21.860 --> 45:26.980]  appreciate it. And if you did enjoy it, even if you just got like a smirk and maybe not a full
[45:26.980 --> 45:32.720]  on laugh, but just like a little like maybe tell somebody, tell somebody, hey, that show is medium
[45:32.720 --> 45:39.420]  entertaining. Or if you have low standards, that's just funny as f***. Yeah. So and also give a like
[45:39.420 --> 45:44.840]  and a review of that like say like I like and here's the review of my like on the podcast store,
[45:45.940 --> 45:51.720]  Spotify or the iTunes. That's it. Thank you for listening. Goodbye. I think that was pretty good.
[45:52.140 --> 45:56.000]  We didn't even have Eric come in. Was that good, Eric? That was that's the best one we've had in
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.220]  six episodes. Did we wake you up from your hate nap? Woke up just for that.
