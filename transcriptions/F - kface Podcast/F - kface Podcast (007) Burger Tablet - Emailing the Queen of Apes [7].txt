[00:40.540 --> 00:47.900]  Hello, and welcome to F*** Face Episode 7, a podcast about your penis in your mouth and the
[00:47.900 --> 00:54.780]  places you put them. My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[00:55.080 --> 00:55.240]  Hello.
[00:55.400 --> 00:55.820]  How's it going, guys?
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.240]  Hello. I'm good. I'm just curious, any big events happen in your guys' week, the last week? Like,
[01:03.260 --> 01:07.640]  if you had to describe things that had happened in the last week, what would be the notable things?
[01:09.100 --> 01:14.980]  Uh, I had... well, yes, and it's something I want to talk about today. I did something very,
[01:15.600 --> 01:21.020]  very cool yesterday that I want to show you guys, and it's a big event for me because it was,
[01:21.080 --> 01:23.980]  I think it's brilliant, and the realization of a really cool idea.
[01:24.780 --> 01:27.340]  Or do you mean, like, did I get married or have a kid or something?
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.200]  No, just, like, how was your week? Like, if someone said, what happened in your week,
[01:32.340 --> 01:33.060]  what would you say?
[01:33.500 --> 01:34.660]  Up and down. How about you?
[01:34.660 --> 01:38.160]  Up and down. I meant more like a specific event type thing.
[01:38.320 --> 01:39.460]  Oh my god, just tell us!
[01:39.920 --> 01:46.380]  I can tell you that my grill outside has never lit. I've always had to shove, like,
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.980]  an actual lighter down into the gas area, and then it goes, and it scares me. But I found
[01:52.580 --> 02:00.340]  that there's, like, a 9-volt battery hanging out that you can change, and then I did that,
[02:00.380 --> 02:02.380]  and now it sparks and lights itself.
[02:02.820 --> 02:03.940]  Oh, your igniter was dead?
[02:03.940 --> 02:09.400]  Yeah, and I'm so happy that I can light it now. I've only grilled, like, twice, but still,
[02:09.480 --> 02:10.340]  it's very exciting.
[02:10.560 --> 02:13.960]  The idea of you grilling anything fucking terrifies me. It really does.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.500]  If it makes you feel better, I'm mainly doing, sort of, you know,
[02:16.540 --> 02:19.760]  impossible meat and fake sausages so I can't kill myself.
[02:20.060 --> 02:24.120]  Oh, okay. Well, that's good. I actually have a... Andrew, I know you're going somewhere with this,
[02:24.220 --> 02:30.700]  but I actually have a grill-related f***face that I had completely forgotten about until
[02:30.700 --> 02:37.100]  this moment. I just... when I got... I used to be a big griller. I used to be a big smoker and
[02:37.100 --> 02:40.920]  griller. It's like every dickhead with tattoos and a beard in Texas is.
[02:41.300 --> 02:42.680]  Like a big green egg thing.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.060]  Yeah, and so I used to have a bunch of grilling-related stuff, and I left it at the old
[02:47.060 --> 02:54.000]  house when we got divorced and moved out. And so when I got my new house, I wasn't ready to get
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.200]  back into grilling yet, and so I bought, like, a tiny little, like, hibachi that's on the ground,
[02:59.200 --> 03:02.940]  and I've been using that for a year, and it worked fine, but I just got kind of f***ing sick of
[03:02.940 --> 03:08.320]  bending down on my knees or watching my dog bump into it and being scared she's gonna knock the
[03:08.320 --> 03:13.660]  f***ing grill over. So I started doing research, and I bought this thing called a PK Grill.
[03:15.460 --> 03:21.200]  And if you... if you are a fan of Real Housewives or Beverly Hills, it has nothing to do with PK
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.640]  or PK. And you guys won't get that reference at all, but that's okay.
[03:25.340 --> 03:30.120]  Guy... anybody that is a Real Housewives fan definitely will think that that was hilarious.
[03:30.560 --> 03:34.400]  Looks like a silver little... that looks just like a...
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.540]  Mine's black. It's graphite. It's kind of cute and old and kind of 50-ish. Anyway,
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.900]  so I wanted to buy one, and grills are actually a little hard to find right now because of
[03:44.900 --> 03:50.460]  quarantine and, you know, everybody's cooking at home. And so I found this one... I won't call
[03:50.460 --> 03:55.360]  them out locally, but I found this one local place that listed that they had them. And so I
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.140]  went, and I... it said they had one in stock. And so I bought it on, like, Saturday night when I
[04:00.140 --> 04:03.000]  was thinking about it. I was like, I'm gonna f***ing... I'm gonna rip off the band-aid and
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.980]  finally buy this thing. It's kind of expensive, but I've been grilling on my knees for a year.
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.400]  I deserve to at least stand up and grill. And I've always been interested in this thing,
[04:11.700 --> 04:14.540]  and I've done a lot of research on it, and the airflow system is supposed to be really cool.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.120]  Yadda yadda yadda. So last Saturday night, I said, f*** it, I'm gonna buy it because it's a...
[04:20.120 --> 04:23.260]  they have in-store delivery available, and they'll even bring it out to your car,
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.060]  you know, because of safety concerns because of coronavirus and stuff. And so I bought it,
[04:28.100 --> 04:32.040]  and they sent me an email immediately that said, hey, awesome, you can come pick it up tomorrow
[04:32.880 --> 04:38.360]  between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., but don't come. Wait for us to send an email to tell you a designated
[04:38.360 --> 04:43.040]  time. So I went, no problem. So I waited until, like, two or three in the afternoon, and it still
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.480]  hadn't gotten the email, and I was planning on grilling that night. And so I call them,
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.680]  and I'm on the hold, and eventually, I'm on hold forever, and they hang up on me. And I'm like,
[04:51.720 --> 04:54.840]  you know what, it's just down the road, f*** it. So we get in the car, we drive over there,
[04:54.920 --> 04:59.460]  I walk in, and I go, yeah, I bought a grill online, I'm supposed to pick it up today,
[04:59.520 --> 05:02.300]  and they're like, I don't know what you're talking about. And I go, I bought a grill,
[05:02.740 --> 05:07.220]  here's the receipt, I show it to them, and they're like, oh yeah, yeah, that's a great grill.
[05:07.980 --> 05:14.780]  We don't have that. And I go, your website tells me you do. You have... it tells me you have a
[05:14.780 --> 05:22.200]  grill. And they go, no, no we don't. If you bought it, it'll go into our system and we'll
[05:22.200 --> 05:29.200]  order it. And I go, oh, alright, well, I feel a bit duped, but whatever, I've already paid for
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.140]  it, I just want to get the f***ing grill. When can I get it? And he goes, well, the truck comes
[05:33.140 --> 05:37.760]  in on Thursday. This is Sunday, by the way. He goes, the truck will be in on Thursday,
[05:38.040 --> 05:43.500]  and it's a big truck, so it'll take us a couple days to unload it, and you can probably pick it
[05:43.500 --> 05:49.160]  up Saturday. And, you know, exactly seven days after I ordered it. And I was a little
[05:49.160 --> 05:53.240]  miffed about that, but I was like, oh f***ing Christ, okay. And have I told you guys this story?
[05:53.540 --> 05:56.860]  No. No. Okay, I can't remember. I told somebody recently, but I can't remember who it was.
[05:56.980 --> 06:00.840]  I'll be honest, you were pretty deep into the story. Yeah, imagine if we just would have sat
[06:00.840 --> 06:07.280]  here and listened to you retell a story for five minutes. I had the question earlier in my head,
[06:07.400 --> 06:11.440]  but I didn't give myself a break speaking. Like, my mouth was already off to the races,
[06:11.440 --> 06:15.140]  and I had to catch up to it. My brain and my mouth work independently of each other often.
[06:15.800 --> 06:19.020]  So anyway, so I'm like, I'm kind of pissed, because it's like, I f***ing ordered this grill
[06:19.020 --> 06:22.340]  because I said it was in stock, and it's going to take seven days to get here, but whatever.
[06:22.800 --> 06:27.480]  I wake up Monday morning, and the first f***ing thing I do is I check my email,
[06:27.620 --> 06:32.620]  and I get an email from these people saying, hey, we got your grill in stock. Come pick it up.
[06:32.940 --> 06:36.460]  And I'm like, I just talked to the dude less than 24 hours ago. So I go in there,
[06:36.840 --> 06:40.320]  and they go, uh, oh, you're that guy that had the grill, huh? And I go, yeah,
[06:40.320 --> 06:43.780]  I'm the f***ing guy who was here yesterday. And they go, yeah, we got your grill. It's the floor
[06:43.780 --> 06:49.060]  model, though, but don't worry about it. We put it together for you. So it's all done. And I look
[06:49.060 --> 06:52.060]  at the instructions, and I go, oh, yeah, no, no, I don't want to put this together. This looks like
[06:52.060 --> 06:58.440]  a nightmare. Okay. And so he helps me load the floor model in, and I get home, and as I'm setting
[06:58.440 --> 07:02.940]  it up in my backyard, I realize it's covered in scuffs. Like, it's at least a year old. It's got
[07:02.940 --> 07:07.460]  like an inch of dust all over everything, and it's missing about a third of the components.
[07:07.880 --> 07:12.620]  So I got most of a f***ing grill. I paid for all of a grill. I didn't want to go back and deal with
[07:12.620 --> 07:16.380]  those people again, so I just bought everything on the website that I was missing. I was like,
[07:16.440 --> 07:20.980]  f*** it. It's worth it to never go to that place again and talk to those people again. And so I
[07:20.980 --> 07:26.180]  ended up getting most of a grill, and it mostly works, but I'm still waiting on the little things
[07:26.180 --> 07:30.480]  like the temperature gauge, you know? That's my grill story. Sorry. Anyway, Andrew, you were saying
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.880]  something about an event. Wait, you don't have a temperature gauge?
[07:36.540 --> 07:40.620]  No, not currently. But at least you don't have to bend down anymore, right?
[07:40.740 --> 07:44.200]  That's a great point. Yeah, I don't have to bend down. Yeah, I mean, I go by feel anyway,
[07:44.320 --> 07:47.120]  so it was fine. I cooked some steaks. When you said floor model at first, I thought
[07:47.120 --> 07:51.680]  for a split second that maybe it's like a version without a stand. Yeah, that's what I was thinking
[07:51.680 --> 07:57.660]  too. I was imagining it literally being on the floor. Yeah, then I understood the scuffs. Wait,
[07:57.760 --> 08:01.400]  is the temperature... is that the thing in the front that tells you how hot the barbecue is?
[08:01.580 --> 08:04.220]  Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah, that's kind of important. How do you not notice? It's important. Did you
[08:04.220 --> 08:09.200]  just ask if the temperature gauge tells you how hot? Well, I don't know what that part is called.
[08:09.300 --> 08:12.520]  I'm assuming that's what the temperature gauge is, but I'm not going to... I think it's called
[08:12.520 --> 08:17.240]  a thermometer. Yeah. Okay. Well, that works too. I don't know. I thought we'd use an official
[08:17.240 --> 08:21.200]  barbecue lingo here. It's all in on the temperature gauge. You're coming in with a
[08:21.200 --> 08:27.540]  simple thermometer comment, Gavin? We're talking barbecue. We're talking meat heat. It's serious
[08:27.540 --> 08:31.920]  meat. I kind of have a thing to talk about too. Revolving grills. Could be grill. Okay.
[08:31.920 --> 08:36.540]  I'm just going to... these are the events of my week, and it doesn't feel like I've had a
[08:36.540 --> 08:44.060]  really weird week. It's just been a week. I broke a toe. What? I broke a toe by accident. I'm fine.
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.400]  Did you stub it on a fire extinguisher? Oh, you know me too well. No, I opened the door angry.
[08:51.060 --> 08:57.200]  I should have had a nap. You were on the way to your hate nap. I was on the way to my hate nap.
[08:57.200 --> 09:03.360]  Yeah, doors are dangerous. I was just frustrated, and I opened the door as violently as I could,
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.300]  and I didn't know my foot was in the path, and my toe bent back. And when you're in pain,
[09:08.780 --> 09:13.200]  you kind of tense up. So I was just holding the door so it wouldn't give any relief,
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.400]  and then I kind of moved forward, and I'm pretty sure I broke my toe. So that was this part of my
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.640]  week. You seem like such a gentle soul. I can't imagine you really pissed off. I really can't
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.100]  even picture that. It's just one of those things where you think you've solved the problem,
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.580]  but it keeps adding. Geoff is very familiar with this concept. It just doesn't get fixed,
[09:32.680 --> 09:38.420]  and you just keep going back to it. And I just had enough, and I got injured on my way to my
[09:38.420 --> 09:44.500]  hate nap. The second thing Gavin knows about this, Geoff doesn't. I won a Microsoft Surface
[09:44.500 --> 09:50.100]  because I wanted a free burger. And also because of The Last of Us 2. Yeah, you phrased it as you
[09:50.100 --> 09:54.500]  got all worked up over The Last of Us 2, so you won a free Microsoft Surface.
[09:55.140 --> 10:02.180]  But real quick, before that, why did you let me talk for 20 minutes about a mediocre grill story
[10:02.180 --> 10:06.340]  when you were hanging on to a broken toe? You should have told me to shut the fuck up!
[10:06.680 --> 10:10.760]  I didn't know it was a mediocre grill story until you got to the end.
[10:11.280 --> 10:16.040]  I was hoping there'd be a big twist. You could still improve on it, Geoff. You could still walk
[10:16.040 --> 10:22.140]  out, go out there, slam the tip of your dick in your new grill. Dude, it would rip my dick off!
[10:26.420 --> 10:31.480]  It's like cast iron! It's like a weird Strongman competition. You're gonna start
[10:31.480 --> 10:35.800]  slamming your dick on items. I'm like Mr. Lifto from the Jim Rose Side Circus.
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.680]  Congratulations on your Surface? Yeah, so I was playing The Last of Us 2,
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.700]  and that's a stressful game. I don't know if you've ever played those. It's intense.
[10:44.700 --> 10:49.160]  I stopped for a little bit because I got a bit sad with the story, so I just took a little break.
[10:49.500 --> 10:53.760]  Yeah, I was maybe like 30 minutes in. I was really early, and I was stressed. I was like,
[10:53.880 --> 10:58.740]  fuck this game. I need to disconnect. So I went to my spam folder just to see what was there,
[10:58.880 --> 11:02.220]  because I figured that'd be boring. It's like a digital hate nap.
[11:02.540 --> 11:07.520]  Yeah, exactly. I went to my spam folder, and I had an email from Microsoft Rewards saying,
[11:07.580 --> 11:10.700]  hey, you have points. I was like, oh, cool. I have points. Let me look at that. And I only had
[11:10.700 --> 11:17.200]  50 points this month. And I clicked. I had like 5,000, and I know they give gift cards out on
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.060]  Microsoft Rewards. I was like, man, it'd be cool. Can I get a free burger? That'd be awesome. I'd
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.760]  love a free burger right now. So I looked. I needed twice as many points as I needed
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.180]  to get the free burger to get a gift card. So they have this dumb pinata game where you can
[11:31.180 --> 11:34.920]  click it, and you can randomly get points. I've done it before, and I almost never win.
[11:35.620 --> 11:39.120]  I did that like three times, and I won a Surface. So I was trying to get a burger,
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.260]  and I ended up with a Microsoft Surface. That was a pretty good night. How'd it taste?
[11:44.300 --> 11:50.140]  You know, I'll let you know in a week. You should exclusively order burgers on that service.
[11:51.980 --> 11:55.860]  The burger tablet. I like it. How does that work, then? Do you have to sign up for Microsoft
[11:55.860 --> 11:59.620]  Rewards? I don't think I've ever even heard of that. I have so many of those points.
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.020]  You don't use Microsoft Rewards, Gavin? I don't think so. Do I have that automatically,
[12:05.160 --> 12:08.320]  or do I have to start? I don't know. It just seems crazy to me that you wouldn't have...
[12:08.320 --> 12:12.240]  You've been on Xbox Live for over a decade. The fact that you've never registered.
[12:12.560 --> 12:15.240]  Let me try it. Let me see if I can log in and see if I actually have it.
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.480]  I'll tell you something crazy, Andrew. So we used my credit card at Rooseteeth for about five years
[12:20.480 --> 12:26.520]  for all video game purchases. And so I get rewards for all of that. And I've never used
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.380]  my Microsoft Rewards. I forgot they existed until just now. But I get an email every month that's
[12:31.380 --> 12:35.760]  like, you got 8,000 points this month. You got 6,000 points this month. I must have 100,000
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.460]  points. I would love to know how many. Yeah, I don't know if they expire or not. That's great.
[12:39.580 --> 12:46.260]  You should look into that. Holy shit. 24,200 lifetime points. 14,200 available points. So
[12:46.260 --> 12:50.780]  I guess I let some expire. I didn't even know I had this. You can get a burger for that. Or a Tesla
[12:50.780 --> 12:56.700]  or something. I want to sit here and play the piñata game. 100 points, redeem reward. If you
[12:56.700 --> 13:01.060]  win a Surface, what a deflating moment that is for me. Everyone who wins a Surface is left and right.
[13:02.020 --> 13:06.380]  The least significant prize. I would love it if you spent 14,000 points and don't win a Surface.
[13:07.760 --> 13:12.380]  Do I? Okay, one entry. Play now. You have to click. You can click it. If you want to have fun,
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.040]  you click it and it'll break within three clicks. Or you can just say, tell me if I won.
[13:16.400 --> 13:19.460]  It'll open or not open. I want to click it. I want to do it. Yeah, you gotta have fun.
[13:19.760 --> 13:24.120]  You gotta enjoy the experience. Play now. Confirm your... Oh, this is a whole thing,
[13:24.140 --> 13:27.580]  isn't it? Yeah, carry on. This is going to take me some time. So yeah, so I won a Surface.
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.960]  That was pretty cool. And then the third thing that happened this week is, this is kind of a
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.980]  hard thing to explain. I have a friend who I sent a 19 foot inflatable battle bus to,
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.060]  and they had their garage broken into. What is a battle bus? Battle bus is a thing in Fortnite.
[13:45.500 --> 13:51.000]  You hop out of it at the start of the match. You fly over. I don't feel like I need to explain
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.540]  further. Everyone knows what Fortnite is. I like the way you explained PUBG just a mere
[13:55.540 --> 13:59.240]  moments ago, but now Fortnite, you just say Fortnite. Well, Fortnite's a bigger game,
[13:59.540 --> 14:03.960]  I feel like. Yeah, and more culturally relevant, I figure. Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.200]  Womp womp. We're sorry you didn't win this time. Big loser over there. Winner over here.
[14:11.800 --> 14:16.780]  So anyway, I mailed it to this person. We're talking one night about Spencer's GIFs, and like,
[14:16.880 --> 14:22.840]  do Spencer's GIFs still exist? And if they do, what are they doing? I don't see how Spencer's GIF,
[14:22.840 --> 14:28.060]  obviously before pandemic, would survive. Like, who's buying stuff from Spencer's GIFs now?
[14:28.600 --> 14:32.940]  And so we went on their website, and they do. Do you remember how, like, in the back of Spencer's
[14:32.940 --> 14:36.680]  GIFs, they'd have all, like, the kind of weird sex stuff? Like, it'd be like dumb merchandise
[14:36.680 --> 14:40.900]  in the front, like lava lamps and whatnot, and then there'd be kind of weird, like, sex type
[14:40.900 --> 14:47.180]  stuff. What is Spencer's GIFs? Is that like a geeky junk sort of shop? It's like where merchandise
[14:47.180 --> 14:53.920]  goes to die in the life cycle. Like, say, like, you get, like, a Family Guy t-shirt at, let's say
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.980]  it's at Dillard's, and then a year later, it's that shirt is at Target, and then six months later,
[14:58.980 --> 15:05.180]  that shirt is at Walmart, and then it's at Spencer GIFs. It's like the bottom, it's like one step,
[15:05.540 --> 15:11.440]  it's like right outside is the dumpster where, like, licensed merchandise goes to die, and it
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.320]  filters through Spencer on the way to the dumpster. It's a store that when you're, like, eight, you
[15:15.320 --> 15:20.200]  think has edgy merchandise. And then, like, they'll sell a bar of soap with a hole in it, and it's
[15:20.200 --> 15:26.340]  like, put your dick in it. Yeah, that kind of stuff. Edgy. Yeah, and so they had a gaming section.
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.780]  Also, a lot of sex toys on their front page at that time. They're just all in on that. Anyway,
[15:30.820 --> 15:35.160]  they had a gaming section, and I looked, and they had a Fortnite section, and the most expensive
[15:35.160 --> 15:41.920]  thing they had was a 19 foot, or no, 19 foot long, 18 foot high battle bus that you could inflate.
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.140]  Which is the dumbest thing. Nobody needs this. And so we're talking... What was that before? Like,
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.860]  a kid's birthday in a field? What would that be? I don't know. It's the size of an actual bus. It's
[15:52.860 --> 15:58.460]  huge. It's a massive, yeah, it's like a bus-sized inflatable battle bus. Bus. And so we're talking,
[15:58.580 --> 16:02.460]  and it's like, well, we need to have this, but what do you do with a battle bus? So I said,
[16:02.940 --> 16:08.560]  I will buy this, I will send it to you if your roommate will live a full week with it inflated
[16:08.560 --> 16:13.380]  in his room that is much smaller than the dimension of the battle bus. I will get that
[16:13.380 --> 16:17.120]  person something nice. I don't know what it is, we could figure it out later, I don't know what
[16:17.120 --> 16:22.640]  they want. I will get them something. And they agreed to it, so I mailed it, and they lasted
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.520]  one day with the battle bus fully inflated. I have videos and stuff I could post. That was it?
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.960]  One day? They lasted... Well, I guess what happened was the position the battle bus was in was over
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.340]  one of the vents, and it was sucking in all the cold air and spitting it out hot as the inflatable
[16:39.340 --> 16:44.440]  with the fan. So it was apparently extremely hot in there, and he was done after a day.
[16:45.120 --> 16:50.480]  So he never got anything, but this person was recently, their garage was broken into,
[16:51.020 --> 16:57.060]  and they have all sorts of Vans collectible shoes. I know that'll hurt you, Geoff. And they had all
[16:57.060 --> 17:02.160]  this corning equipment, and all this stuff. And the entire time, he's talking about losing all
[17:02.160 --> 17:05.600]  these important, expensive items. I'm just thinking, where's the battle bus? Is the battle
[17:05.600 --> 17:10.600]  bus okay? Did they steal the battle bus? And I asked. They did not steal the battle bus,
[17:10.780 --> 17:15.260]  but they took it out of the cardboard and rolled it out to try to figure out what it was.
[17:15.420 --> 17:19.580]  And that's just the funniest fucking thing to me. Imagining that you're in the middle of
[17:19.580 --> 17:25.880]  robbing someone, and you're like, what is this heavy box? And then opening it to find a 19-foot
[17:25.880 --> 17:30.220]  battle bus, and then rolling it out, and then having to have a conversation about, do we steal
[17:30.220 --> 17:35.880]  this? Is this worth something? What is this? How much was it worth, this thing?
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.480]  Oh, it was like 500 bucks, 450 maybe. Oh my god. Damn, dude.
[17:40.840 --> 17:45.880]  Yeah, we as a group came together to buy this battle bus. But I just love the idea that these
[17:45.880 --> 17:48.840]  people are breaking in, and just being like, oh shit, these are great. These are expensive,
[17:48.980 --> 17:54.340]  rare shoes. All this recording. What is, oh, a battle bus? Just any conversation those people
[17:54.340 --> 17:59.600]  had to have regarding if it was stealable. I imagine it'd be very heavy too, and just, yeah.
[18:00.240 --> 18:04.760]  That was my week. I imagine the thieves unrolling it, and looking at it, and going,
[18:05.120 --> 18:07.480]  you know what? I don't feel bad about robbing these fuckers.
[18:08.800 --> 18:12.460]  Because they had a 19-foot battle bus. Like, these guys are fucking losers.
[18:13.080 --> 18:17.080]  Fuck Fortnite. We're just going to steal you, weren't we? We're going to create more roof.
[18:17.260 --> 18:21.120]  We're doing a second trip. Oh god. I'm going to floss my way out of here.

[19:26.620 --> 19:32.400]  Mack Weldon. He could be like a James Bond. He could be... I'd buy insurance from Mack Weldon.
[19:32.580 --> 19:37.060]  I'd certainly buy a new car from Mack Weldon. I would probably trust him with my investments.
[19:37.860 --> 19:43.180]  Definitely an international man of mystery. Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics,
[19:43.400 --> 19:48.820]  and simple shopping. Well, if those aren't the three tenets of my ethos, I don't know what are.
[19:49.200 --> 19:52.720]  That's why it takes no time to get the best products sent straight to your door.
[19:52.720 --> 19:57.460]  Mack Weldon offers the most comfortable underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts,
[19:57.880 --> 20:01.020]  hoodies, and sweatpants, and more that you will ever wear.
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.800]  They have a line of silver underwear and shirts that are naturally antimicrobial,
[20:06.140 --> 20:10.700]  which means they eliminate stank-ass odor. And it's the same material used by NASA and
[20:10.700 --> 20:15.360]  the Olympic athletes. You know what that means. Space Olympics. I'll buy my ticket today.
[20:15.900 --> 20:19.840]  They want you to be comfortable. They demand it. They deem it necessary.
[20:19.840 --> 20:24.280]  So if you don't like your first pair of underwear, you keep it. They don't care.
[20:24.600 --> 20:28.460]  They'll refund you the money anyway. They just want you to be happy and comfortable, of course.
[20:28.720 --> 20:32.020]  We already covered that. They won't even ask you questions. They don't want to know.
[20:32.360 --> 20:35.920]  They just want to know that you're happy. Not only does Mack Weldon's underwear, socks,
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.760]  and shirts look good, they perform well too. Seriously, these guys ace the MCAT. They don't
[20:42.760 --> 20:47.120]  even care. They're also great for working out, or for going to work, or for going out on dates,
[20:47.120 --> 20:53.040]  or just everyday life. It's essentially, they're like that friend you have who's better looking
[20:53.040 --> 20:59.560]  than you, and also smarter, and faster, and stronger, and pretty much better in every way,
[20:59.740 --> 21:03.460]  and you want to hate him, but you can't because he's also a really nice guy with a good personality
[21:03.460 --> 21:08.560]  and super, like, well-grounded. Yeah, they're like that. They're like him. That guy.
[21:08.780 --> 21:13.620]  The folks at Mack Weldon have even created their own totally free loyalty program.
[21:13.620 --> 21:20.160]  What? It's called Weldon Blue. Level 1 gets you, that's the first level, it gets you free shipping
[21:20.160 --> 21:26.140]  for life. And once you reach level 2, all you got to do is spend $200 to do that. Mack Weldon

[21:31.120 --> 21:38.240]  about. Those are savings, my friend. 20% savings. You know, here's my personal experience browsing
[21:38.240 --> 21:44.300]  the Mack Weldon store the other day. MackWeldon.com, of course. I was overwhelmed with
[21:44.300 --> 21:51.680]  all of the different options and style. I know we talked about the silver thing. If you, I don't
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.200]  know, maybe you want to be the Herald of Galactus someday. I can't think of a better way to do it
[21:56.200 --> 22:02.900]  than to slap on some silver antimicrobial Mack Weldon garments to keep you safe up there in
[22:02.900 --> 22:07.160]  space. It's cold up there. We talked about the Space Olympics earlier. You think you're not
[22:07.160 --> 22:13.400]  going to need warm underwear for that? You are. For 20% off your first order, visit MackWeldon.com

[22:36.400 --> 22:42.080]  I talked about it in the last podcast that I'm really excited about that I think is a whole new
[22:42.820 --> 22:48.580]  genre of entertainment. And I sent it to you guys on Discord. I want you to look at an image and see.
[22:51.080 --> 22:58.190]  Do you see what it is? That's beautiful. Oh my god. How did you... So you had to like...
[22:58.740 --> 23:05.140]  Did you have to stop and like pre-plan the next letter? Yeah. So what I... I'll put this up online
[23:05.140 --> 23:09.340]  somewhere. I thought about just posting it on Instagram today and just saying explanation to
[23:09.340 --> 23:16.140]  come. But what I've been doing... I mentioned it probably in a couple other podcasts, but I ride
[23:16.140 --> 23:21.240]  my bike every day. I try to ride for about 30 miles. And I got it into my head because there's
[23:21.240 --> 23:25.560]  all these apps. Like Under Armour makes an app and I have this one called Pacer where you can
[23:25.560 --> 23:30.200]  record your bike rides or your walks or your drives or whatever. And so I've been recording
[23:30.200 --> 23:35.880]  all of my bike rides and I thought it would be cool someday to layer all those on top of each
[23:35.880 --> 23:42.620]  other. And then maybe someday try to... I try to ride my bike on every street in Austin within
[23:42.620 --> 23:46.200]  the city limits. Like I'd like to like fill the map out. Like think of it like a video game.
[23:46.480 --> 23:52.980]  Like just complete that quest and ride my bike down every single street in Austin that it's
[23:52.980 --> 23:57.240]  legal to ride a bike on. Obviously not the interstate or Mopac or you know that kind of
[23:57.240 --> 24:01.940]  thing. But no highways, but just every surface street. And so I've been kind of doing that,
[24:02.120 --> 24:07.760]  not intentionally, but I just, I record my bike rides every day. And at some point I'm going to
[24:07.760 --> 24:12.020]  figure out the technology of how to put it all together and see what I have left to do so that
[24:12.020 --> 24:16.740]  I can, I can, you know, turn my bike rides into a video game challenge. But it struck me,
[24:17.220 --> 24:23.520]  you could write shit. Yeah. So looking at this, you've had to, I assume, start with the F?
[24:23.520 --> 24:28.500]  I started with the F at Speedway. I started at 38th street and Speedway.
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.640]  So I assume you would go to the top right of the F and backtrack down to make the middle?
[24:34.420 --> 24:41.580]  100%. So I drove from, on my bike, I drove up 38th street to Guadalupe. And then I drove,
[24:41.760 --> 24:47.360]  took a ride on Guadalupe and drove to 42nd street and then back and then backtrack and then down,
[24:47.480 --> 24:52.000]  I think to Avenue C and then in a bit and then down. And anyway, in the course of that,
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.940]  I spelled the word fart in a bike ride just to see if I could. My girlfriend and I did it.
[24:58.440 --> 25:03.060]  And basically what we did was I, we got to the neighborhood and I, I took a screenshot of the
[25:03.060 --> 25:10.380]  map and then we just drew on our iPhones, the best letters we could F-A-R-T and tried to make
[25:10.380 --> 25:17.220]  them connect. And the goal being to never turn off or pause the recording. So I had to, I had
[25:17.220 --> 25:21.660]  to do it in one, you know, like one smooth motion. I had to backtrack and stuff. But yeah,
[25:21.720 --> 25:27.260]  I think it was about, it took about 30 minutes to do. And just like, I was just, it got to the
[25:27.260 --> 25:30.860]  point where I got pretty good at it. I was riding with my phone in one hand, watching me make,
[25:31.160 --> 25:37.260]  like draw on the map as I rode and then we would stop. And then it was, it was quite a painstaking
[25:37.260 --> 25:42.740]  process. But yeah, it took us about 20, 30 minutes and I was able to spell the word fart in my bike
[25:42.740 --> 25:48.240]  ride. And I'm very proud of that. I think that's brilliant. And I'm hoping this ushers in a whole
[25:48.240 --> 25:55.140]  new era of people doing like bicycle map art. Like you could do like a butthole or a giant
[25:55.140 --> 25:59.680]  penis or, you know. You could write F-face. You could write F-face. Yeah. And so I,
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.340]  the possibilities are endless. I'll be honest though, you've switched between capital letters
[26:04.340 --> 26:10.640]  and lowercase there. I did what I could. And I'll be honest with you. Emily and I disagreed about
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.820]  some of the letters. Like she, I was not, I wasn't crazy about the way we did the F and the A,
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.840]  but I will admit, I will concede that, uh, we, we did her route and that worked out better,
[26:22.120 --> 26:26.160]  but I still think the R to the T could have been better. You are such a stickler for
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.940]  lettering. Do you remember the arguments that we used to have trying to write stuff in Minecraft?
[26:30.320 --> 26:36.000]  Like the obsidian and how we could never agree on where the, uh, where the N should be formed
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.600]  because we only had several pixels. My, my font treatment for it has been terrible. Anyway. Yeah.
[26:40.660 --> 26:47.560]  And so, uh, I, I would, I challenge, I give, and obviously every idea I've ever had, uh,
[26:47.560 --> 26:53.380]  3000 people had before me. Yeah. Uh, it's been the story of my life. Like fucking Flora's Lava,
[26:53.380 --> 26:57.620]  the Netflix show, which I pitched to Netflix and they already had it in development. God damn it.
[26:57.980 --> 27:02.320]  You pitched it to Netflix? Yeah. Do you remember when we did, do you remember when we did Lava
[27:02.320 --> 27:07.800]  Chicken? Uh, like two years ago or whatever, we pitched that to Netflix as a show called Flora's
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.220]  Lava. And they were like, yeah, it's already in development. Fuck. I bet it wasn't. They were
[27:11.220 --> 27:17.120]  just like, yeah. It takes two years to make a Flora's Lava show? It seems hard to believe.
[27:17.580 --> 27:22.140]  These things take time. So I like this. I like this challenge, Geoff, because, uh, it's, you know,
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.940]  it's good exercise. And honestly, the further you go, like the longer the distance, the more
[27:26.940 --> 27:32.240]  resolution you have to play with. Like you could do some fancy lettering. Yeah. What you really
[27:32.240 --> 27:38.140]  need is an app where other people can write over your shit, like a physical version of Splatoon.
[27:38.260 --> 27:44.400]  Yes, absolutely. We need some sort of an app. People that make apps need to create some sort
[27:44.400 --> 27:52.580]  of a cool app that encourages, uh, bicycle map art and also some sort of competitive thing like,
[27:52.660 --> 27:57.540]  like Splatoon or Tony Hawk Pro Skater, where you can write over each other's territory and shit.
[27:57.540 --> 28:03.000]  The whole, whole untapped market, I assume, without ever having looked to see if this exists already,
[28:03.160 --> 28:08.220]  and it probably does, and is hugely popular. Much like when we made Red vs. Blue and we thought we
[28:08.220 --> 28:13.780]  invented machinima, and we found out that it had existed for like 15 years, and we were fucking
[28:13.780 --> 28:19.860]  stupid. I assume that I'm fucking stupid here, but I had the idea to spell the word fart with my
[28:19.860 --> 28:25.160]  bicycle on a map, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Was there much debate over what word
[28:25.160 --> 28:34.100]  to spell? No, no debate. Well, yeah, Emily likes caca. She wanted to do caca, but I like fart.
[28:35.980 --> 28:43.460]  And I'll probably do poo and ass as a Simpsons reference for Gus, and I'll do f*** face, and I
[28:43.460 --> 28:49.100]  would like to draw a big veiny dick, but I'm not sure how to do veins and stuff yet, but I'll get
[28:49.100 --> 28:53.540]  there. But I hope the audience does too. I like the idea because you're trying to do this in one
[28:53.540 --> 28:57.660]  smooth motion, that there's some sort of emergency halfway through one of your words, and you're like,
[28:57.900 --> 29:02.500]  no, I can't stop. I gotta keep going. I gotta smooth out this letter. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah,
[29:02.980 --> 29:07.320]  for sure. There is a little bit of that where you're like, I'm riding in the middle of the road
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.220]  because I want to make a straight line, and there's a car behind me honking, and I'm like,
[29:11.300 --> 29:15.660]  fuck you, dude. Go around. If I go to the right, I'm gonna have a squiggle in my T. I'm not doing
[29:15.660 --> 29:21.860]  a squiggly T. But it's essentially cursive, right? Like, it's block letters, but it's essentially
[29:21.860 --> 29:26.300]  cursive in that I couldn't break the line at any point. Now, are you gonna have to go to a
[29:26.300 --> 29:32.460]  different area? Like, do you, even though, I mean, I'm sure you do another run, fart isn't permanent
[29:32.460 --> 29:37.480]  here, but would you feel like you're going over your own, like, design? Oh, like, do I need to
[29:37.480 --> 29:42.140]  find, like, have I filled that chalkboard? Yeah, like, even though that's not permanent, do you
[29:42.140 --> 29:46.120]  feel like you could go over this again, or is this route now done? You can't touch it. No, I could go
[29:46.120 --> 29:51.200]  over it again, I think. Okay. That's the fart route, but we'll make more. It makes me wonder
[29:51.200 --> 29:55.460]  how many times have I accidentally written something without ever realizing? Uh-huh, 100%.
[29:55.960 --> 30:02.600]  Yeah. I bet I've walked a good poo without knowing. Yeah, it's like when you do the word
[30:02.600 --> 30:06.600]  scramble, and, you know, you're supposed to circle, find the words and circle it, and you're
[30:06.600 --> 30:11.000]  like, and then you see a word that's not on the list, and you're like, tree. There's a fucking,
[30:11.040 --> 30:15.540]  they snuck an extra tree in here. It's essentially that. If we could somehow get live tracking,
[30:15.660 --> 30:19.800]  this would be the greatest game ever. Just trying to guess what the word is as you're fucking
[30:19.800 --> 30:26.500]  spelling it. Or do like, or like, or you could even do, uh, I'm giving out million dollar ideas
[30:26.500 --> 30:29.620]  here, but you could, do you remember, like, Twitch plays Pokemon? You could be like,
[30:29.780 --> 30:34.220]  Twitch spells shit, and then Twitch, like, votes and tells you where to write, and you just have
[30:34.220 --> 30:45.420]  to do it. Twitch spells shit. Oh, that's a great idea. I know, I know that it's not yours, and
[30:45.420 --> 30:48.940]  other people have done it. It's innovative. It's a great idea, though. Yeah, it's like you modernized
[30:48.940 --> 30:55.260]  writing something dumb on an Etch-a-Sketch. It's a lot more work. I respect them. Well, it was a lot
[30:55.260 --> 30:59.520]  of work, because it was about 100 degrees when I did it. I'm so surprised an Etch-a-Sketch was so
[30:59.520 --> 31:03.920]  successful. It's impossible to do anything on those. But the people that can, though, they're
[31:03.920 --> 31:08.240]  fucking wizards. Oh, it's amazing. They're amazing. Yeah. Yeah, my ex-wife was quite the Etch-a-Sketch
[31:08.240 --> 31:12.300]  artist, for sure. Yeah, I saw some of those. Yeah. You think you're just naturally good at that,
[31:12.320 --> 31:18.920]  or is that a practice? I mean, obviously you practice whatever, but I was garbage from a
[31:18.920 --> 31:22.280]  practice every day for the rest of my life and not be as good as somebody who could just pick it
[31:22.280 --> 31:28.140]  up and is naturally talented at art. Do you guys have a go-to thing that you can draw? Like, I
[31:28.140 --> 31:33.420]  can't draw anything, really. No. If you had to draw something, do you draw a house or anything
[31:33.420 --> 31:40.140]  simple? No. I can draw a face that's looking up and smiling really well. You can draw a... Yeah,
[31:40.680 --> 31:46.900]  not like a realistic face, like a cartoon face. There is a guy... Could you do one now? No,
[31:46.900 --> 31:51.820]  I don't have paper, I don't have a pencil. Here's a question. Do you have a bicycle?
[31:53.540 --> 31:58.280]  Can you bike it? Yeah, let's bike this. Well, I don't... You know what? Huh, how would that work?
[31:58.600 --> 32:03.120]  I'd have to... I don't know. You know when you're learning to drive a car and how parallel parking
[32:03.120 --> 32:08.280]  is more mechanic? Like you measure up using mirrors and stuff? Yeah. It's not you're going
[32:08.280 --> 32:13.140]  by eye. It's a system you use. That's why I can draw that. There's an art teacher that came in
[32:13.140 --> 32:16.640]  in grade four and taught the whole class how to do that. So I know how to make the lines.
[32:17.160 --> 32:21.160]  That's the only thing I can draw though, because I have no natural drawing ability. I just really
[32:21.160 --> 32:25.200]  want to see it somehow. I think you should walk it out or bike ride it out. But I mean,
[32:25.260 --> 32:28.380]  depending on the complexity, you might have to like cut through people's houses and shit.
[32:28.700 --> 32:33.820]  Yeah, that might be tough. I'm okay with that. I'm committed though. I'll figure that out.
[32:34.140 --> 32:38.980]  I can't even imagine what that looks like. A face looking up. I'm trying to imagine what angle
[32:38.980 --> 32:43.660]  that's from. Can you please tweet us? Draw this and tweet it to us. You know what? Actually,
[32:43.660 --> 32:50.800]  I don't think the angle even really makes sense. Can you scroll it on like a note? Do you have a
[32:50.800 --> 32:54.660]  phone that you just like do a little doodle? I literally have nothing I can write with
[32:54.660 --> 32:59.320]  right now. I don't have a thing. I got a fire hydrant and that's it. That's the only thing
[32:59.320 --> 33:07.140]  I got on my desk. That seems like overkill, but I'm prepared to use it. Have you ever seen a fire
[33:07.140 --> 33:11.900]  hydrant go off? You can't aim those. It's like a bomb. It's like a grenade. They just explode
[33:11.900 --> 33:17.060]  everywhere. It's a mess. The hydrant in the street or the extinguisher? Oh, did I say hydrant?
[33:17.140 --> 33:21.880]  I meant extinguisher. Yeah, that's what I was... Have you seen how big a hydrant is? Like how
[33:21.880 --> 33:26.900]  deep underground they go? They're giant. They're massive. Yeah, like the hydrant bit sticking out
[33:26.900 --> 33:30.320]  the top is just the top of them. It's crazy. That makes sense. Yeah, it makes total sense.
[33:30.460 --> 33:35.260]  It's like an iceberg. Yeah, I'm gonna post one for you. Is it like a well? You got a
[33:35.260 --> 33:43.440]  well length? I have to vamp? Andrew, what's new in your world? Oh, I have an update. I have
[33:43.440 --> 33:46.580]  something I want to talk about that's gonna make no sense, because this is gonna come out two weeks
[33:46.580 --> 33:50.760]  after. We're recording two back-to-back, so it conversationally makes sense now, but when this
[33:50.760 --> 33:58.620]  airs, it's gonna be so old. So orangutan, orangutan. Big revelation for me. I was really upset when we
[33:58.620 --> 34:04.000]  finished recording. I refused to believe that I was completely in the wrong. So I looked into it,
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.260]  and I found multiple sources that said orangutan was appropriate. I saw multiple spellings of
[34:10.260 --> 34:13.820]  orangutan. That's probably just like one of those incorrect spellings and uses that is
[34:13.820 --> 34:18.700]  so commonly misused that it becomes real. I'm ten steps ahead of you, Gavin. It becomes like
[34:19.340 --> 34:24.020]  colloquially... yeah. Yeah, ten steps ahead. You want to try again? I'll be quiet.
[34:24.660 --> 34:32.800]  Cloak? Cloak? Who is good at the end of... I can't say it right now. Why can't I say the word?
[34:33.320 --> 34:37.600]  You want to give it another shot? I kind of want to. Colloquial, colloquial,
[34:38.420 --> 34:42.960]  colloquial, colloquial. God damn it. I can't say it. Keep going. Get it. It's frustrating.
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.560]  You say it. Colloquialism. Yeah, but colloquially. Colloquially. There you go. Thank you.
[34:52.860 --> 34:57.760]  Add that to like collective dole or whatever. What was the mispronunciation you had? Collective
[34:57.760 --> 35:06.220]  dole? What was that? Anyone remember? Oh, uh, officiable. Officiable. I was not even in the
[35:06.220 --> 35:11.880]  right sport. I was in a different state with what I thought that was. I was off. Anyway,
[35:12.380 --> 35:17.580]  I hear what you're saying and I agree. Who knows, maybe common mistake. Maybe it's such a mistake.
[35:17.680 --> 35:22.220]  It's so common. I think it's insane neither of you would heard it, but I could accept maybe it's a
[35:22.220 --> 35:26.240]  common mistake so they kind of allow it. So I thought, who should I... like, I need to clear
[35:26.240 --> 35:30.660]  this up. I can't have this be a mystery in my life. So I reached out to the Queen of the Apes.
[35:30.980 --> 35:37.180]  I sent Jane Goodall an email. What? Looked up her institute. Are you fucking serious? Yeah,
[35:37.360 --> 35:41.760]  I mean, who else am I going to ask? I reached out to the Jane Goodall Institute. See what they're
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.700]  doing. See if they would mind. So I sent them an email explaining the dilemma. Orangutan,
[35:47.880 --> 35:52.800]  orangutan. Is orangutan okay? Queen of the Apes, whatever their ruling is, I'll live with. I'll
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.300]  accept it. I got an email back like a day later. I'll read the results. At the Jane Goodall
[35:58.300 --> 36:04.100]  Institute, we're less familiar with orangutans. Our programs are centered around chimpanzees and
[36:04.100 --> 36:12.140]  in some cases, mandrills. However, we believe it's pronounced orang-yutan. It's derived from
[36:12.140 --> 36:19.640]  the Malay words orang, meaning man, and yutan, meaning forest. So that was it. Forest man? Man
[36:19.640 --> 36:23.420]  of the forest? I guess, yeah, that's the translation. So I have to accept. What's
[36:23.420 --> 36:28.740]  tang translate to? It's a beverage, I believe, Gavin. If you're going to be fucking sarcastic,
[36:28.980 --> 36:38.160]  I can play this game. Man of the beverage. Hey, that's what chef used to be. Yeah, yeah, that's
[36:38.160 --> 36:48.540]  true. You fucking emailed gorillas in the mist. Jane Goodall. Goddamn. You're a ballsy kid, man.
[36:49.260 --> 36:55.400]  Yeah, is that ballsy? I was very polite. It was either her or Dr. Zaius. Man, that's fucking
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.280]  awesome. I wanted a male and female representative, so I tried to reach out to Andy Serkis, but I
[37:00.280 --> 37:06.680]  couldn't. I couldn't find a lot. I figured he would be king of the apes. Were you at the RTX
[37:06.680 --> 37:11.560]  that he came to? You could have asked him then. I was, but I didn't know I was lost at that time.
[37:11.560 --> 37:15.720]  I felt very strongly in my orangutan beliefs at that year.
[37:19.240 --> 37:22.880]  So that was the update on orangutan, which is going to make no sense because this is going to
[37:22.880 --> 37:27.200]  come out two weeks after that conversation. I want to give you an update on the pinata game.
[37:27.260 --> 37:32.860]  I've probably whacked it about 50 times, and all I've won is just more attempts at whacking.
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.960]  Yeah. So no surface just yet. As if anybody didn't need more attempts at whacking in their
[37:38.960 --> 37:45.680]  personal life. Did we vamp enough? What do you mean? Well, you told us to vamp because you were
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.800]  doing something. I was finding a picture of a full-size fire hydrant. Did you do it? Yeah,
[37:49.860 --> 37:54.800]  I posted it. It's like one minute later. I'm looking, I'm looking. It's right there. Yeah,
[37:54.820 --> 37:59.360]  I see it's right there, Eric. It is. You know what it looks like? You know how like when a dog,
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.380]  you know how like when a dog is laying down and his dick pops out a little bit and it looks like a
[38:04.160 --> 38:11.660]  lipstick? That's what this, this looks like a dog's dick. Yeah. What? It looks like a protracted
[38:11.660 --> 38:18.080]  dog's dick. The city's dog dick. That's really interesting. I'd be horrified to hear you in
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.600]  like a Rorschach test. What are these plots? It's a dog dick. That's what those plots look like.
[38:24.740 --> 38:30.260]  You know I'm right. Like different animal dicks. No, I don't, like I don't, I thought it would be
[38:30.260 --> 38:34.500]  a lot deeper, Gavin, based on what you said. I mean, it's pretty big. It's only like, it's
[38:34.500 --> 38:38.380]  like a quarter of the entire thing. It is big. I'll acknowledge that. I just thought it would
[38:38.380 --> 38:43.440]  be longer in my head. Like usually when you, when you look at something like a bank, you know,
[38:43.440 --> 38:53.800]  or a shop, you're looking at most of it. What? Sorry, what? What do you, what? What the fuck?
[38:54.760 --> 38:59.940]  Like a McDonald's, a McDonald's, if you look at a McDonald's, you're looking at like 90%
[38:59.940 --> 39:03.840]  of the McDonald's. I disagree. I've been to a McDonald's that has a basement. You're not
[39:03.840 --> 39:12.480]  seeing half of it. That's a terrible example. You're forgetting the basements. You don't see
[39:12.480 --> 39:19.560]  those second levels. I'll give you there. You don't see basements. I'm not even making a joke
[39:19.560 --> 39:24.660]  about that. I've been in a McDonald's basement. They exist. You know, it's like 50%. Oh yeah,
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.800]  that's a good point. Isn't the basement of the McDonald's where Democrats steal the adrenal
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.860]  glands of children? Or is that pizza restaurants? That was pizza. Domino's.
[39:37.080 --> 39:39.180]  Well, there's a bunch of sponsors we'll never get.
[39:41.700 --> 39:45.360]  Did we have any more sponsors since the other episode? Yeah, I don't think we have to worry
[39:45.360 --> 39:51.340]  about that. Yeah, I don't think it's going to be an issue. Also making this podcast won't be an
[39:51.340 --> 39:56.820]  issue much longer if we don't get any sponsors. God damn it. Why? Because it needs to be profitable?
[39:57.760 --> 40:03.020]  At some point it'll have to make money, I assume. I mean, it's a pretty small crew. There's what,
[40:03.100 --> 40:07.440]  like five of us working on this right now? Yeah. Eric's there. We've got Nick. Well,
[40:07.460 --> 40:13.060]  I would say there's four of us working on it and Eric is there. Well, he was reminding you
[40:13.060 --> 40:16.720]  to look at the hydrant picture. Next to the hydrant picture. That was very useful.
[40:17.700 --> 40:20.200]  I had to get to the hydrant picture to see the note.
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.200]  I gotta look again to make sure he's not... He's gonna bitch about us on Twitter again.
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.840]  He's angry. Did we cover our faces from the last episode that we didn't get to?
[40:31.200 --> 40:34.860]  I think that... What was the one that we said we'd talk about next time? Was that
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.440]  McDonald's? Should we just continue that? I mean, that's kind of... we're near the end here.
[40:40.980 --> 40:44.240]  Do you want to just keep... Oh shit, we have to push it. Are we gonna just do a bit where I
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.260]  keep pushing it? And I still haven't won a surface. Damn it. Womp womp again. I have, you know,
[40:49.260 --> 40:53.800]  something I can talk about. And this is, once again, it's a great idea to reference conversations
[40:53.800 --> 40:59.080]  that happened two episodes ago. Yeah. But before we were... the last episode we recorded, Gavin,
[40:59.100 --> 41:04.020]  you brought up what's the thing you forgot of the most? And I didn't have a really good answer for
[41:04.020 --> 41:08.560]  that. Yeah. And then I was talking to someone and it was probably... I'd say mine is actually
[41:08.560 --> 41:13.720]  stories. There are things that people tell me about that I completely forgot happened until
[41:13.720 --> 41:19.020]  they did. And I had a good one of those. Like to you? Stuff that you yourself experienced?
[41:19.020 --> 41:24.800]  And told them about. Like one of them was our family went to the movies, like our whole family,
[41:24.920 --> 41:30.880]  like grandparents, cousins, a lot of people. And we thought we're gonna sneak, we're not gonna...
[41:30.880 --> 41:34.380]  Popcorn costs so much to go to the movies because that's where they make their money.
[41:34.940 --> 41:40.140]  We're like, we're gonna be fucking smart about this. We're gonna make the popcorn ahead of time,
[41:40.640 --> 41:47.160]  put it in sandwich bags, sneak it in, distribute it in the theater, work around. It's a genius crime.
[41:47.160 --> 41:50.480]  Yeah. I mean, that's, I mean, across like 10 people, that's probably like
[41:50.480 --> 41:54.220]  80 bucks worth. Yeah. It's a lot. Yeah. It's expensive. It's a lot of popcorn.
[41:54.220 --> 41:58.580]  Popcorn for 10 people at a movie theater in 2020 would be a thousand dollars.
[41:58.860 --> 42:00.660]  It's outrageous. It's very expensive.
[42:01.120 --> 42:05.980]  It's very expensive. So we had this whole plan and I volunteered to be the popcorn mule.
[42:06.320 --> 42:12.140]  I was confident in my abilities. So we got this old jacket that was too small
[42:12.560 --> 42:19.560]  and I put eight or nine Ziploc bags of popcorn in this jacket and we zip me up and I was all good.
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.720]  I was more protected than if I was wearing Kevlar. It was so thick. I had so much popcorn
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.900]  and it was so compressed against me. And so we get to the theater, we're all there and I'm like
[42:29.900 --> 42:33.180]  getting nervous about it. So I'm acting like they're my offensive line and I'm like trying
[42:33.180 --> 42:37.220]  to hide behind them and we go through the ticket person and we make it through the ticket person
[42:37.780 --> 42:43.240]  and then we get into the theater and the fucking zipper broke. I couldn't get the jacket off.
[42:43.620 --> 42:49.860]  I tried everything I could and it was so tight. I couldn't get it off and I couldn't get my hands
[42:49.860 --> 42:57.180]  into it. So nobody got popcorn and I watched the entire movie and it's a jacket filled with it.
[42:57.400 --> 43:04.440]  I had like nine bags, like sandwich size Ziploc bags in this fucking jacket, just miserable
[43:04.440 --> 43:09.520]  watching this movie. One of the worst theaters. That's not true, but it was a bad experience.
[43:10.160 --> 43:14.380]  I just imagine them having to cut you out of the jacket when you go over and it just popcorn
[43:14.900 --> 43:22.040]  explodes out. I think we did have to cut open the jacket. It's all like sweaty popcorn. It was
[43:22.040 --> 43:28.220]  terrible. Did you guys eat the popcorn? No. No, the popcorn is over. It's gone at that point.
[43:29.020 --> 43:32.840]  What was the movie? I have no memory of the movie. I forgot this even happened to me. I was
[43:32.840 --> 43:36.500]  talking to someone. They said that it's one of my favorite stories you've ever told me. I was
[43:36.500 --> 43:42.220]  like, oh yeah, that. Yeah. Forgot about it. I'm surprised you don't forever remember that movie
[43:42.220 --> 43:46.200]  as like the popcorn one. Like whenever you watch it again now, you're like, man, I remember watching
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.700]  this with popcorn strapped all around me and I couldn't get out. I've had so many bad theater
[43:50.700 --> 43:57.280]  experiences that it just, I think it got erased. Like I remember Star Trek, what was the second
[43:57.280 --> 44:02.020]  new Star Trek? Like Into Darkness or something? Into the Darkness or some shit. Yeah. I remember
[44:02.900 --> 44:08.040]  just being so hungry because Ray ate my pizza. That's all I think about when I watch that movie
[44:08.040 --> 44:12.240]  now. Like I can remember the point in the movie where I'm like, pretty sure Ray's eating my pizza.
[44:12.480 --> 44:15.700]  And I remember the point where I finally got the pizza towards the end. And I actually,
[44:15.900 --> 44:18.620]  there's such vivid feelings whenever I watch that movie.
[44:21.180 --> 44:25.640]  I think one of like the most obnoxious things that have ever happened to me in a movie theater
[44:25.640 --> 44:30.700]  is halfway through this movie there, I was a kid's movie. So it's like, whatever you accept,
[44:31.080 --> 44:35.220]  you accept that there's going to be noise and chaos. The little girl in front of me got up,
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.420]  stood on her chair and pulled out a thing, a paddle ball and started playing paddle ball
[44:40.420 --> 44:44.380]  in the middle of the movie. It's the most distracting thing I've ever experienced in
[44:44.380 --> 44:49.360]  watching something. Someone's playing fucking paddle ball. Can I tell you the worst thing I've
[44:49.360 --> 44:55.240]  ever done in a movie? Uh, I, oh, I feel like maybe that's not accurate. I'd have to think
[44:55.240 --> 44:59.020]  about that for a while. But the worst thing I've ever done that comes to mind, and it's actually,
[44:59.160 --> 45:04.680]  it kind of hurts my heart to admit it, but I took Millie to see Madagascar, I don't know,
[45:04.760 --> 45:09.560]  two or three, whichever one that was. No, it, it wasn't that. I'm sorry. It was Bolt.
[45:09.980 --> 45:13.400]  Do you remember that movie Bolt? Yeah. With the fucking dog pigeons and shit. Yeah,
[45:13.400 --> 45:19.800]  I played it recently. Terrible film. It was a terrible movie and it was so bad. It was so bad
[45:19.800 --> 45:24.460]  that about an hour into the movie, Millie had to go to the bathroom. It was just us, the two of us,
[45:24.460 --> 45:28.840]  daddy-daughter day. And I took her to the bathroom. And when she came out, she must've been
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.840]  six or seven, whenever that movie came out, maybe less, maybe five. When she came out of the theater
[45:33.840 --> 45:38.060]  and I said, okay, let's go home. And she goes, what do you mean? And I go, uh, oh, the movie's
[45:38.060 --> 45:43.380]  over. And she goes, is it? And I go, yeah, it ended. And she goes, I don't, what happened?
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.600]  And I go, I had the dog. Everybody was happy. And she was like, just like confused. She was like,
[45:48.420 --> 45:52.400]  okay. And then I took her home and I didn't watch, she didn't get to watch the second half of
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.300]  the movie because I was so miserable watching it. And I still, I will go to my grave feeling like a
[45:57.300 --> 46:02.240]  monster for doing that. That and the time that we went to, we're going to a convention in Orlando
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.540]  and Millie was like six, she was six years old. We're going to a convention in Orlando.
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.560]  And I was trying to hide the fact that Disney World was in Orlando because I knew she'd want
[46:12.560 --> 46:17.500]  to go. And we were like flying in late on a Friday night and leaving first thing Sunday
[46:17.500 --> 46:21.700]  morning. I was going to do a convention appearance. She'd look at the plane and see it.
[46:21.940 --> 46:26.440]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, there was no, there was no time to go to Disney World. And so I just
[46:26.440 --> 46:31.820]  didn't want her to know. Cause I didn't want to take that away from her, you know? And so I did
[46:31.820 --> 46:37.920]  a good job of running interference about it. Uh, and then before we were going to, uh, it was back
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.800]  when we traveled a lot. We went to fucking Sydney, Australia the week before we went to Orlando.
[46:43.380 --> 46:47.980]  And we check into the hotel after like a hellacious two hour, you know, like day and a
[46:47.980 --> 46:51.260]  half flight to get there. And the whole thing, you know, Gavin, you've been to Australia a bunch of
[46:51.260 --> 46:54.880]  times. It's a fucking nightmare. And you, you, you're like, you get there, it's like eight in
[46:54.880 --> 46:58.840]  the morning and you're exhausted and it's 90 degrees outside and it's fucking hot and sunny.
[46:59.340 --> 47:04.280]  And you're just all discombobulated. We check into the hotel. Millie goes, can I watch TV?
[47:04.300 --> 47:08.480]  And I go, yeah, dude, fucking go for it. Turn on the TV. I'm gonna take a nap. She turns on the TV
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.680]  and there's a commercial for Disney World in Australia. Like, good night, mate. Go on down
[47:13.680 --> 47:20.900]  to fucking Orlando. Didgeridoo Mickey, you know? And she goes, I watched her face go,
[47:21.940 --> 47:28.480]  Disney, Orlando? Dad? Dad? And I go, yeah. And she goes, is Disney, is Disney World in Orlando?
[47:29.640 --> 47:36.320]  And I go, yeah, yeah, it is. And she goes, uh, are we going to Orlando real soon? And I go,
[47:36.320 --> 47:39.280]  yeah, we're going next week. And she goes, oh my god, we're gonna go to Disney World! She's like,
[47:39.340 --> 47:42.120]  woohoo! She's excited. And I'm like, dude, I don't know that we're gonna have time. I'm trying to
[47:42.120 --> 47:45.320]  set it. And she's like off to the races, running around the room excited, like going, like,
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.540]  Disney World, I'm gonna see Mickey Mouse, blah, blah, blah. And so when we got to Orlando a week
[47:50.540 --> 47:57.040]  later, we got off the bus, or got off the plane, and then you take a tram to, like, the other side
[47:57.040 --> 48:01.220]  of the airport to go to baggage. And there's a Disneyland, there's like a Disney World store
[48:01.220 --> 48:06.340]  in the airport. And she goes, we walked by, and she goes, oh my god, is that Disney World?
[48:06.820 --> 48:12.600]  And I went, yes, it is. Yes, it is Disney World. And she goes, can we go? And I said,
[48:13.260 --> 48:18.200]  yes, you can. And she walked into the store, and she looked at a bunch of stuffed animals,
[48:18.420 --> 48:23.140]  and I let her buy one thing, and then I never told her that it wasn't Disney World. And until
[48:23.140 --> 48:28.440]  she was, until my mom took her when she was like nine, she thought Disney World was a store in
[48:28.440 --> 48:36.160]  Orlando airport. Did she ever find out that she's never seen all of Bolt? Uh, yeah. Yeah,
[48:36.260 --> 48:42.580]  she knows now. She's, like, almost 15. She knows, she's well-versed in all the lame shit I did,
[48:42.700 --> 48:48.860]  yeah. I like the idea of her not knowing, even on the trip, and them walking by at the airport,
[48:49.040 --> 48:54.400]  Millie, being like, where are we going? We're missing it. Why are we leaving? I feel,
[48:54.980 --> 48:59.900]  even telling the story now, like, eight years later, my heart hurts.
[49:01.980 --> 49:06.500]  I can't imagine walking in, being like, man, I didn't know Disney World sold travel plugs.
[49:06.840 --> 49:12.760]  She, she was like, she was like, she, even at six, she was like, I thought it would have been
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.360]  different. And I was like, yeah, no, this is it. This is Disney World. Do you see it on the sides
[49:19.360 --> 49:23.500]  up front? Disney World store, yeah. And she's like, huh. And I know in her head, she's like,
[49:23.500 --> 49:27.580]  I can barely read. I guess I'll just listen. I guess I trust her. Did you feel like you were
[49:27.580 --> 49:32.480]  getting away with a crime in the moment? It was a crime of necessity because I just didn't want
[49:32.480 --> 49:37.200]  to break her heart and, and tell her we went all the way to the land of Mickey Mouse and she
[49:37.200 --> 49:41.860]  couldn't go, but there just wasn't time. And then she's been to, she's been to Disney World twice
[49:41.860 --> 49:47.160]  since then with my mom. So it's, it all evens out, but man, do I still feel like a monster for that?
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.380]  Well, to be fair, if you get to go to real Disney World after an airport job, I bet that's way,
[49:52.380 --> 49:57.920]  that's like a huge boost. Oh yeah. Yeah. I remember she came home, uh, after going to
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.300]  the real Disney World and she just had a look in her face like, you motherfucker.
[50:02.940 --> 50:06.660]  Like, yeah, no, I know. And then, you know, I was like, don't worry, we'll get you therapy.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.100]  Oh dear. I feel like you get points for not lying when she asked, is it in Orlando? And you,
[50:13.160 --> 50:16.740]  you told her, you told her the truth at that point. I did. I didn't have a choice. It was
[50:16.740 --> 50:21.400]  on fucking... No, you say it's Orlando, Kansas. You just say it's the same name. It's in a different
[50:21.400 --> 50:27.860]  place. It's man, I had jet lag. I was not in my middle. I didn't know. I wasn't thinking that
[50:27.860 --> 50:33.020]  fast on my feet at that moment. Oh, well, um, I think that was a nice episode. I've been thumping
[50:33.020 --> 50:37.920]  this pinata for the entire thing. And, uh, I've, I've not won a surface yet. I think you got really
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.660]  lucky, Andrew. I think I did. Yeah. Well, wait, is your motivation to get a burger? Because that
[50:42.660 --> 50:46.700]  might be... Oh no, I was trying to get the surface. Let me try. Let me think. Yeah. I think
[50:46.700 --> 50:50.920]  you gotta, your heart needs to be in the right place. Yeah. So when does yours, when does yours
[50:50.920 --> 50:56.040]  arrive? Uh, I think next week. Are you excited? Those things are no joke these days. They're
[50:56.040 --> 51:01.220]  really good. Are they? I don't really know anything about them. So I know Bill Belichick
[51:01.220 --> 51:05.400]  throws them because he doesn't like them. That's all I know about Microsoft Surface.
[51:06.420 --> 51:11.800]  I'm excited to use them. I think the first thing you should do is install the Grubhub or DoorDash
[51:11.800 --> 51:15.500]  app and order a burger. It's a great idea. Yeah. I bet you could set up some sort of macro where
[51:15.500 --> 51:19.760]  you just press one button and a burger shows up. Your burger button. You should make a burger
[51:19.760 --> 51:25.060]  button. Dude. I kind of had something like that before, but it didn't work. What about this for
[51:25.060 --> 51:30.580]  an app? Uh, whatever you write on the street, on the maps, it's waiting for you when you get home.
[51:30.840 --> 51:34.280]  That would be awesome. What were you gonna say, Andrew? Well, no, I'm just thinking about like,
[51:34.340 --> 51:38.260]  imagine going home and there's a fart waiting. Like how would that be? Is it in like a jar?
[51:39.260 --> 51:41.000]  There is a guy waiting for you.
[51:43.460 --> 51:47.380]  All right. Uh, now's the, I think this is the part of the podcast where Andrew ends it. So, uh,
[51:48.040 --> 51:52.720]  take it away. Yo, you want me to end it? Eric's, Eric's written the instructions right there. You
[51:52.720 --> 51:58.680]  see? Who's, who's, uh, tell. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to thank Geoff and Gavin for joining
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.880]  me on another wonderful episode. Thank you. Thank you. We learned a lot. We, I, we got to see
[52:03.880 --> 52:09.500]  beautiful art. I nearly cried. Gavin's been hitting a pinata for what? 15 minutes. Yep. Not
[52:09.500 --> 52:13.680]  winning a single surface. Didn't win a single surface. Just want to point that out. Once again,
[52:14.440 --> 52:19.520]  not a single win. I want to, what else am I supposed to do? Tell people to tell a friend.
[52:19.700 --> 52:25.760]  If you have a friend or if you have an enemy and you don't like the podcast, tell the enemy about
[52:25.760 --> 52:30.040]  it. Say it's great. Lie to them. If you like the podcast and you have friends, somebody you care
[52:30.040 --> 52:36.160]  about, tell them. We'd really appreciate it. Leave a rating. Five star, I mean, preferably five or
[52:36.160 --> 52:40.220]  four, four to five stars, I guess would be, do we care? I think we care about the rating, right?
[52:40.220 --> 52:44.860]  I don't think you should tell people the, the rating to give. I think you should just say. No,
[52:44.940 --> 52:49.020]  you know, yeah. I mean, obviously, rate from your heart. Yeah, I would say we easily- But if your
[52:49.020 --> 52:53.560]  heart was a five star, that would be great. We tow the line between a solid like five to six out
[52:53.560 --> 52:58.640]  of 10 every week. And then you've got to obviously translate to the five star method. I think it's
[52:58.640 --> 53:03.600]  a solid three. It's, it's a solid, we'll just say five because that's what Eric said. He says
[53:03.600 --> 53:07.300]  it's five. Eric says it's five. Don't listen to Gavin. We're going to get a bunch of mediocre
[53:07.300 --> 53:11.840]  reviews. Well, I mean, that'd be accurate though. That'd be the truth. It's, you're putting it in
[53:11.840 --> 53:16.020]  their head that it's only a three though. Put it in their head that it's a five. Do you think it's
[53:16.020 --> 53:23.360]  a five? Uh, out of 10, at least. But if there's only, if there's only five stars, still use the
[53:23.360 --> 53:28.280]  10 point system. You just go up as high as you can. Got it. As close to the 10. Yeah, the top
[53:28.280 --> 53:34.520]  five stars are hidden. Yeah, exactly. That's how it works. And subscribe. Oh right, you were doing
[53:34.520 --> 53:38.300]  this one. Yeah, yeah, that's what you, you threw it in my court. Now you want it, if you want to take
[53:38.300 --> 53:44.520]  it back, I'll gladly give it to you. I don't, no, I, I, you take the rock. Okay, subscribe on whatever
[53:44.520 --> 53:49.040]  app you're on. In all seriousness, thank you so much for listening. This is such a stupid show
[53:49.040 --> 53:56.220]  that I have so much fun recording with my two friends. One friend, one kind of asshole who likes
[53:56.220 --> 54:05.120]  to fart and stuff. Um, we live with it, but... Holy shit, there's only 50 surfaces in this
[54:05.120 --> 54:11.860]  Pinata. Yeah, I know, it's a pretty good draw, right? Yeah, it's 50 Xbox Live, I've continued
[54:11.860 --> 54:18.600]  the podcast by the way, 50 Xbox Live Ultimate Passes, 25 Xbox One Xs, and 50 surfaces, and the
[54:18.600 --> 54:24.780]  rest are just garbage. How often does it refresh? Is it like 50 a day or just... No, no, it's like
[54:24.780 --> 54:30.080]  waves, I read the rules, I think it's three sets of 50 over like three months. So I could be trying
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.900]  to win a bunch of surfaces that have already been won. Yeah, it's possible that, uh... This is,
[54:35.100 --> 54:41.440]  ah, I've, my browser crashed. Gavin just figured out that gambling isn't worth it. It works for
[54:41.440 --> 54:45.900]  some people like Andrew Panton. I'll gamble, as long as you go in accepting you're gonna lose,
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.160]  it's great, gambling's fun. Couldn't recommend, well, no, I don't recommend it, don't, don't do
[54:50.160 --> 54:54.760]  it, but it's great. It's terrible, but it's fun. I'm still ending this show, right? That's what
[54:54.760 --> 54:59.560]  happening? What did I, I, we subscribed? Did it end, Eric? Was that, was the end in there? I think
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.800]  we're good, I think I got the ratings, I got the, no, we're still, what, what, what do I need to
[55:04.800 --> 55:09.280]  say? What am I missing? I think I got the ratings. No, I think you nailed it, I was, the only thing
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.960]  I was gonna add is that, like, if you have an opinion on Eric, we'd love to hear it. He's
[55:13.960 --> 55:19.320]  typing. He's typing. Hold on, he says... Eric, why don't you just talk? Why are you typing to us?
[55:19.420 --> 55:23.900]  All right, so Eric, Eric wants us to end it with this, so I'll just, I'll just say what Eric said,
[55:23.900 --> 55:33.400]  and then we can just end it, okay? He said, yeah, trying, no, still going, say thanks and goodbye,
[55:33.920 --> 55:40.380]  you're adding something? Why? I said thanks. I told the people thanks. I think Andrew covered
[55:40.380 --> 55:44.700]  all that, I think he did it. I don't, I didn't say goodbye. Well, I just did now. You said yes,
[55:45.100 --> 55:49.160]  you, you were trying, for sure, you were definitely still going, hell, we're still
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.880]  still going, so we're doing that. How long is this exit? Is this the longest exit we've had?
[55:53.900 --> 55:58.660]  I hope so. This is like, I feel like this is like five minutes of us ending the show.
[55:58.900 --> 56:03.220]  Why don't we just cut it, cut it to when Andrew stopped talking the first time?
[56:03.900 --> 56:07.860]  We could do that. When did that happen? Like now? Like when I stop now?
[56:08.400 --> 56:12.760]  Right there, right then. That was it. Uh oh, hold on, I got an email. Was it? Oh,
[56:12.860 --> 56:16.020]  it has nothing, it has nothing to do with this, never mind. It wasn't Eric telling you to stop?
[56:16.260 --> 56:19.680]  No, no, it wasn't at all, actually. Oh, well, I'm at it, I got a lot of emails, hold on.
[56:20.700 --> 56:24.440]  I got an email from Quibi telling me the trending this week is The Stranger. Do you
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.140]  guys see The Stranger on Quibi? What is The Stranger? It's where you sit on your hand,
[56:28.220 --> 56:29.700]  isn't it? It's like a...
