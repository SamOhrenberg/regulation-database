[00:45.240 --> 00:49.760]  Geoff and Gavin for always being so wonderful and hilarious. You two really killed it this episode.
[00:50.380 --> 00:55.520]  I want to thank the brains behind this operation, Nick and Eric. There sure would be a much lesser
[00:55.520 --> 00:59.960]  version of itself without the two of you. And I most importantly want to thank you,
[01:00.020 --> 01:04.640]  the listener. In a world of a billion podcasts, the fact that you've chosen to spend this time
[01:04.640 --> 01:10.160]  with us is greatly appreciated. Without you, there is no us. This is getting long-winded,
[01:10.160 --> 01:14.100]  so I'll just close this by saying, if you enjoy the show and haven't subscribed,
[01:14.760 --> 01:20.680]  please do so. Also, please leave the show a positive rating and a review. Both of those
[01:20.680 --> 01:25.860]  things are a huge help in growing the show. Thank you so much for your support, and have a wonderful
[01:25.860 --> 01:26.100]  day.
[01:26.920 --> 01:32.980]  He wrote it down! He was reading it! It's a script! And you prepared that!
[01:33.280 --> 01:40.660]  You know sometimes when you're listening to a podcast app and you've skipped ahead on an episode
[01:40.660 --> 01:45.080]  right at the end, but then whenever you re-listen to it, it starts at the end? I thought that was
[01:45.080 --> 01:48.720]  happening, but then I realized this is live. Well, Eric always complains about our endings,
[01:48.820 --> 01:52.040]  so I just wanted to make sure we got a good one. Was that good, Eric?
[01:52.240 --> 01:54.680]  That was the best ending we've ever had at the beginning.
[01:54.680 --> 01:57.040]  That was pretty clean. I put some effort into that.
[01:57.140 --> 02:00.600]  Goodbye and welcome to the backwards episode of F*** Face.
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.420]  It's just, you're always like, the endings aren't good, so I figured if we start
[02:04.420 --> 02:08.400]  with the end, then we'll have a lot of time to get that ending down.
[02:08.620 --> 02:12.460]  We know the ending is good now. Yeah, I feel like we got it. It's in the can. We're good.
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.720]  All right, f***ing first take, that one. Congratulations.
[02:15.380 --> 02:19.820]  That was great. I feel like I nailed that. I'll be honest, I had a... no, Andrew,
[02:19.880 --> 02:23.840]  that was perfect. That was brilliant. I had a whole introduction I wanted to do,
[02:23.840 --> 02:26.880]  and you just f***ing steamrolled through it.
[02:27.280 --> 02:29.040]  Well, I feel like you could still... do you want to do the intro?
[02:29.220 --> 02:31.940]  No, no, no, I don't want to do it. That's kind of the outro.
[02:32.340 --> 02:35.800]  Yeah, we'll just save the intro for the end. All right, we'll save the intro for the end.
[02:35.860 --> 02:37.520]  That's a great idea. Can I do the intro? Yeah.
[02:37.720 --> 02:42.460]  All right, that's fantastic. All right, well, thanks for that, Andrew. Thanks for tuning in.
[02:42.700 --> 02:44.880]  No problem. It was good to do a podcast with you.
[02:45.120 --> 02:53.120]  I don't know how to go from end to beginning. Well, I mean, the story about Andrew's burgers
[02:53.120 --> 02:56.560]  was brilliant, and I'm really glad that he told it.
[02:56.580 --> 03:01.020]  Yeah, I mean, we teased that for, like, two shows. Man, what a great story that was.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.480]  I think it worked out great.
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.880]  Could you believe the ending? I know I didn't tell you guys about that twist
[03:05.880 --> 03:09.660]  ending until then. What a moment that was. You guys were shocked. It was great.
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.520]  I'm so f***ed.
[03:15.060 --> 03:18.160]  How about a burger recap? Oh, you want to do a recap?
[03:18.460 --> 03:21.280]  In the same... you think that's necessary? The same episode to recap?
[03:21.280 --> 03:22.880]  Well, just rewind it a bit.
[03:23.160 --> 03:28.140]  Okay, well, I guess where do we even begin? I guess the question is... maybe to open it
[03:28.140 --> 03:32.760]  more broadly... I feel like everybody has a food they think they could eat way more of
[03:32.760 --> 03:33.860]  than they actually can.
[03:34.320 --> 03:37.400]  You came to me with this. You were asking me what I would pick,
[03:37.820 --> 03:41.280]  and you went with McDonald's, just regular hamburgers?
[03:41.400 --> 03:43.160]  Yeah, like a single cheeseburger.
[03:43.640 --> 03:44.580]  A cheeseburger, okay.
[03:44.760 --> 03:50.340]  Yeah, like a basic burger. Not even a cheeseburger. Just a basic burger. That was mine. What was
[03:50.340 --> 03:51.820]  yours, Jack? You don't want cheese.
[03:52.160 --> 03:54.420]  No, well, if you're going to eat a lot of them.
[03:54.500 --> 03:59.120]  Mine is easily black olives. I thought I could eat a thousand black olives in one minute,
[03:59.180 --> 03:59.760]  and I can't.
[03:59.880 --> 04:00.340]  Are you serious?
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.380]  Yeah, you hit a black olive limit a lot quicker than you think.
[04:04.640 --> 04:08.760]  You just f***ing twisted me because you told me banana popsicles at the time. I did not
[04:08.760 --> 04:11.300]  see that coming at all. That was a massive twist.
[04:11.700 --> 04:12.020]  Olives?
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.580]  But black olives... well, banana popsicles I have succeeded in eating. I only ate banana
[04:17.580 --> 04:24.280]  popsicles and banana Laffy Taffy as sustenance for about 14 months, and I'd say 30 pounds.
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.240]  Right after I got separated, when I moved out on my own and I became a quote-unquote
[04:30.240 --> 04:36.220]  single in my 40s, all I knew how to eat, I realized, were banana popsicles and banana
[04:36.220 --> 04:41.000]  Laffy Taffy. But in terms of things that you think you can eat a lot of, and then you find
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.860]  out you can't, Gavin dared me to eat a can of olives on stage live in front of 3,000
[04:46.860 --> 04:52.460]  people once, and in 60 seconds, just large black olives, and I couldn't get through
[04:52.460 --> 04:54.340]  half the can, and I was humiliated.
[04:54.880 --> 04:56.560]  It was embarrassing. I didn't like it.
[04:56.560 --> 04:57.440]  I was embarrassed.
[04:57.880 --> 05:01.620]  Yeah, I was embarrassed for you. So Andrew just came to me one day. I've actually got
[05:01.620 --> 05:05.160]  the Slack still open. He said, what is the food that you think you could eat the most
[05:05.160 --> 05:11.040]  of within a 12-hour time limit? I went for penne pasta, because for some reason, if I've
[05:11.040 --> 05:16.280]  ever just made pasta, I always get seconds. I don't know what it is with penne. So I said
[05:16.280 --> 05:23.380]  I could eat four boxes in 12 hours. And he said, no, I probably couldn't. I think my
[05:23.380 --> 05:24.680]  stomach would just split.
[05:24.900 --> 05:25.600]  There's no way you could.
[05:25.720 --> 05:27.340]  Start leaking penne into my cavies.
[05:27.360 --> 05:29.400]  So many carbs. That's so much pasta.
[05:29.780 --> 05:35.740]  But, you know, it's delicious. Then you said, what about McDonald's single burgers? I think
[05:35.740 --> 05:41.560]  I could, without struggle, eat 50 McDonald's dollar menu burgers in 12 hours.
[05:41.840 --> 05:45.520]  I think I went in saying the hardest part would be not ordering fries as a side. I
[05:45.520 --> 05:47.700]  was very confident in my ability.
[05:48.020 --> 05:53.100]  I then went on to say you're an idiot. You're a fool. That's like one every half an hour.
[05:54.140 --> 06:00.620]  Ridiculous. No, that would be 24 hours. So you're talking, yeah, like four an hour. Ridiculous.
[06:01.140 --> 06:04.920]  I think the time, the math ended up being I needed to eat a burger every 10 minutes
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.340]  for what we settled on.
[06:07.100 --> 06:12.900]  And I predicted that after 20, you'd be seriously slowing down. So how did it go?
[06:12.900 --> 06:17.160]  Well, yeah, well, I think we should also add there's a bet. We had a bet on this
[06:17.160 --> 06:21.180]  as well. Like once we agreed, I essentially asked every person I knew because I thought
[06:21.180 --> 06:24.060]  I could do it and wanted to make a bet with somebody. And you're the first person
[06:24.060 --> 06:27.820]  that agreed to a bet. We had a $50, 50 burger bet.
[06:28.120 --> 06:33.360]  Yeah, I will always be willing to put up money that is, you know, an amount that would be useful
[06:33.360 --> 06:37.980]  in my life and spend it on something completely pointless that I don't even get to see.
[06:38.340 --> 06:39.040]  Yes, absolutely.
[06:39.040 --> 06:41.920]  Like $50, I could buy an Xbox game for that. Well, most of one.
[06:44.960 --> 06:48.620]  But yeah, it was a 50. If I ate all 50, I really we should have done like a middle.
[06:48.780 --> 06:53.380]  If I was smart, like if I hit 25, then we're even. And then I could progress from there.
[06:53.460 --> 06:55.160]  But when did this happen, by the way?
[06:55.860 --> 07:00.100]  According to my timestamps, this was March, the 9th of March.
[07:00.380 --> 07:00.820]  This year?
[07:01.060 --> 07:01.320]  Yeah.
[07:01.840 --> 07:06.680]  So this is in a this is in a fucking quarantine COVID world. You guys are
[07:07.780 --> 07:09.400]  right around the start of it.
[07:09.400 --> 07:14.600]  It wasn't like a real it was right before I'd say, yeah, it is right before it happened.
[07:14.960 --> 07:19.900]  You came to me with so it was the day before you asked me about it about about 2 p.m.
[07:20.260 --> 07:23.060]  9 a.m. the next morning. We were still talking about it.
[07:23.380 --> 07:28.660]  And by 1 p.m., you sent me a picture of three bags full of McDonald's.
[07:29.540 --> 07:30.700]  Yeah, I was ready to go.
[07:30.800 --> 07:34.840]  So wait a minute. Am I meant to believe here that you guys started talking about it at 2 p.m.
[07:34.840 --> 07:38.460]  and we're still talking about it at 9 a.m. as if you gabbed through the night,
[07:38.460 --> 07:41.000]  like two schoolgirls talking about cute boys in class?
[07:41.360 --> 07:43.360]  I think that was a slight break. I don't think we were.
[07:43.980 --> 07:46.920]  No, there were some tough negotiations over pickles. Were pickles allowed?
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.040]  Could I modify the burger?
[07:48.240 --> 07:50.920]  We went up there at like 3 a.m. like, tee hee hee.
[07:51.300 --> 07:53.900]  That's important. That's that's a that's a great point. What is the answer?
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.380]  Are they just like bog standard as they come burgers?
[07:56.780 --> 08:00.820]  I modified them to my liking. So I took the pickles off and I just felt like I needed
[08:00.820 --> 08:03.960]  I took the onions off, too, because it just seemed like any amount of food,
[08:04.400 --> 08:05.420]  additional food would be bad.
[08:05.420 --> 08:07.580]  Do you have an issue with onions and pickles?
[08:07.780 --> 08:10.500]  Are you just I don't like pickles? I'm not a fan of pickles.
[08:10.500 --> 08:13.820]  But yeah, the onions I just felt like from a room perspective.
[08:14.120 --> 08:17.200]  That's I mean, if 50 burgers worth of onions is a lot of onion,
[08:17.460 --> 08:18.980]  so I could I could just get rid of that.
[08:19.380 --> 08:20.300]  I'd be a leg up.
[08:20.500 --> 08:23.520]  Onions are also they're surprisingly high in fat content,
[08:23.620 --> 08:26.620]  although I don't know that an onion in a McDonald's hamburger is a real onion.
[08:27.240 --> 08:31.180]  Uh, I see. I feel like I would keep the onion because I the biggest
[08:31.620 --> 08:34.340]  mental block for me would be just the boredom of the flavor.
[08:34.960 --> 08:38.160]  And I would I would maybe pull some onions out of my first five,
[08:38.220 --> 08:42.780]  sling them all in my sixth one, really get really reset the palate.
[08:43.500 --> 08:46.880]  You should have just yeah, just tell the tell the cook or the chef.
[08:47.560 --> 08:49.040]  Just like surprise me.
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.020]  Give me 50. I don't want them all to be the same.
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.500]  Make these as different as possible using the same ingredients.
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.220]  Um, yeah, I don't and pickles just I don't like pickles.
[09:02.400 --> 09:03.360]  I'm not a pickle guy.
[09:03.360 --> 09:04.640]  I don't really eat pickles.
[09:05.060 --> 09:09.160]  I learned like within a year that pickles were cucumbers and that blew my mind.
[09:09.360 --> 09:10.820]  That was a huge revelation.
[09:11.280 --> 09:14.700]  Yeah, the pickle part is the is the process is the process.
[09:14.840 --> 09:16.080]  Yeah, like a pickled onion.
[09:16.200 --> 09:17.140]  Yeah, I had no idea.
[09:17.580 --> 09:20.980]  I was watching like some cooking video or was like a chef making a fancy burger.
[09:20.980 --> 09:23.140]  And he's like, we're going to make our own pickles.
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.220]  And I was like, how do you do that?
[09:24.260 --> 09:25.200]  And he pulls out a cucumber.
[09:25.340 --> 09:28.600]  I was like, there's no way this isn't they're not connected.
[09:28.860 --> 09:31.920]  Are you a fan of cucumbers or do you dislike cucumbers?
[09:31.920 --> 09:33.880]  I have no opinion on the cucumber.
[09:34.040 --> 09:35.120]  I never really had a cucumber.
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.760]  Cucumbers are fucking delicious.
[09:37.040 --> 09:37.360]  Are they?
[09:37.820 --> 09:40.480]  I just weird to me that that would make you not like pickles.
[09:41.160 --> 09:43.900]  When you found out it started its life as something else.
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.300]  That's not necessarily why it's a texture thing.
[09:46.340 --> 09:47.340]  Mainly for me with pickles.
[09:47.500 --> 09:50.420]  I just I had no idea that they I thought they were in their own thing.
[09:50.480 --> 09:53.940]  I thought you could pull a pickle from like a tree or something at some point.
[09:55.740 --> 09:59.180]  I never thought about I didn't think about where they came from.
[09:59.200 --> 10:01.760]  I just assumed that you could be in a field somewhere and find a pickle.
[10:01.920 --> 10:05.840]  I love the idea of you planting pickle seeds and then it just grows as cucumber.
[10:06.020 --> 10:07.180]  And you're like, God damn it.
[10:07.520 --> 10:08.040]  It's broken.
[10:08.480 --> 10:12.880]  But yeah, ordered 50 burgers, no pickles, no onions.
[10:13.580 --> 10:14.440]  What was the price?
[10:14.980 --> 10:16.460]  What was the cost?
[10:16.520 --> 10:17.520]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[10:17.620 --> 10:18.280]  What is the price?
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.480]  I had it delivered.
[10:19.780 --> 10:20.900]  So it was there's a delivery.
[10:21.040 --> 10:22.260]  I think it came to like $70.
[10:23.100 --> 10:24.760]  So even if I won the bet, I was down.
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.060]  I've got the stats here.
[10:26.200 --> 10:28.600]  50 hamburgers, 240 calories each.
[10:28.940 --> 10:30.680]  Remove pickles, remove onions.
[10:30.680 --> 10:32.500]  Delivery fee, five bucks.
[10:33.060 --> 10:36.040]  Total food and beverage cost $94.50.
[10:36.680 --> 10:37.020]  Really?
[10:37.320 --> 10:37.800]  Wow.
[10:37.900 --> 10:39.580]  So if I would have won the bet, I would have...
[10:39.580 --> 10:41.600]  You tipped the delivery guy $18.
[10:43.580 --> 10:45.260]  That's very generous of you.
[10:45.360 --> 10:47.240]  Well, COVID wasn't quite a thing yet.
[10:48.020 --> 10:52.100]  I'm not trying to slow this story down to pad for time, although that would be awesome.
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.720]  But I am curious if we remove the pickle and the onion, what is left?
[10:57.860 --> 11:00.660]  And like, I would like to know what the composition of the remaining burger is.
[11:00.680 --> 11:02.120]  It's just condiment.
[11:02.600 --> 11:04.180]  It's ketchup and mustard, I believe.
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.000]  So it's all beef patty, ketchup, mustard, sesame seed bun.
[11:08.260 --> 11:08.600]  Yes.
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.060]  Oh no, I don't think there's sesame seeds on the...
[11:11.420 --> 11:12.720]  I think it's just the plain bun.
[11:12.960 --> 11:13.620]  There's no sesame?
[11:13.980 --> 11:15.820]  I don't think there is.
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.060]  I can tell you that with your onion choice, you remove 240 calories of onions.
[11:21.260 --> 11:21.640]  Wow.
[11:22.220 --> 11:23.720]  Surprisingly high in fat content.
[11:23.960 --> 11:25.740]  That's like one whole burger less.
[11:25.740 --> 11:26.580]  Ha ha.
[11:29.300 --> 11:34.220]  There is really no strategy to it beyond, I assume that would take up additional space.
[11:34.580 --> 11:37.180]  And I was trying to... most space I could possibly have.
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.520]  Like, you're smart talking about like the different textures.
[11:39.860 --> 11:40.940]  That was not a consideration.
[11:41.220 --> 11:43.320]  I went into this thinking it would be super easy.
[11:43.760 --> 11:47.180]  I was honestly just blown away at how confident you were.
[11:47.560 --> 11:49.640]  Because a stomach is only so big.
[11:49.800 --> 11:50.860]  And look at those bags.
[11:50.980 --> 11:53.260]  Look at those giant bags full of food.
[11:53.840 --> 11:54.120]  How?
[11:54.540 --> 11:59.580]  It's one thing I've always said about Andrew is he has the confidence of a much more capable man.
[11:59.900 --> 12:00.300]  Yes.
[12:00.640 --> 12:01.320]  Yes, they do.
[12:01.680 --> 12:05.780]  If I think I can do something, there's like 100% I believe I could.
[12:05.880 --> 12:06.740]  There's no 50.
[12:06.940 --> 12:09.060]  It's like, I'm absolutely going to be able to do this.
[12:09.180 --> 12:10.320]  It's zero or 100.
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.360]  I have no middle.
[12:11.900 --> 12:12.540]  And then you did.
[12:12.900 --> 12:13.820]  And then I tried it.
[12:13.900 --> 12:14.120]  Yeah.
[12:14.480 --> 12:15.920]  I was actually... I was nervous.
[12:17.040 --> 12:19.800]  I felt bad submitting a 50 burger order.
[12:19.960 --> 12:21.680]  I got a letter from the people that worked there.
[12:21.720 --> 12:22.460]  They were like, thank you.
[12:22.680 --> 12:23.880]  Thank you for such a big order.
[12:23.880 --> 12:24.980]  We appreciate that.
[12:25.240 --> 12:25.960]  Do they appreciate that?
[12:26.300 --> 12:26.660]  I guess.
[12:26.740 --> 12:27.160]  I don't know.
[12:27.240 --> 12:30.380]  I didn't think they would, but I got a letter from them saying like, this is great.
[12:30.680 --> 12:30.960]  Thank you.
[12:31.200 --> 12:33.300]  Kill them with Canadian kindness every time.
[12:33.660 --> 12:36.700]  By 2pm, according to our Slack conversations,
[12:37.240 --> 12:41.300]  Andrew Panton says, one bite in, I may have greatly underestimated these burgers.
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.440]  Yeah, because I have...
[12:46.440 --> 12:47.200]  One bite in!
[12:47.280 --> 12:47.900]  No, yeah.
[12:48.120 --> 12:52.420]  I have a lot of confidence going into things, but as soon as it starts, I can kind of see my limit.
[12:52.960 --> 12:57.900]  And it went from this is no problem to I took a bite and was like, this is a problem.
[12:58.780 --> 13:01.420]  I greatly underestimated these buns.
[13:01.840 --> 13:03.160]  These buns are an issue.
[13:03.540 --> 13:07.220]  I can't believe you didn't take a dry run at any point and just say,
[13:07.340 --> 13:09.520]  let me eat one burger and see how I feel.
[13:09.760 --> 13:10.640]  Why would I do that?
[13:10.880 --> 13:11.740]  That makes sense.
[13:12.380 --> 13:13.320]  That's a good game plan.
[13:13.760 --> 13:14.760]  Was the first one good?
[13:15.120 --> 13:16.240]  No, the first one was fine.
[13:16.360 --> 13:16.500]  Yeah.
[13:16.880 --> 13:17.400]  I don't mind it.
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.400]  So when did it get shitty?
[13:18.580 --> 13:21.360]  When did it get a little bit palatably boring?
[13:21.880 --> 13:23.940]  Seven. I'd say seven in.
[13:24.460 --> 13:25.340]  Oh, that checks out, actually.
[13:25.720 --> 13:33.740]  At 5.30pm, a bowl of blackberries was introduced at burger eight.
[13:35.280 --> 13:37.560]  Yeah. I had to try to do something.
[13:38.320 --> 13:40.220]  Why would you just eat some random fruit?
[13:40.640 --> 13:41.700]  Oh, because it's small.
[13:41.760 --> 13:42.420]  Eat anything, right?
[13:42.760 --> 13:45.200]  Yeah. I wanted a different taste and it was small.
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.340]  It's a small item to consume.
[13:46.400 --> 13:47.620]  I didn't think it would take up much space.
[13:48.060 --> 13:49.760]  I blazed through the first five.
[13:49.760 --> 13:50.820]  It was impressive.
[13:50.820 --> 13:52.660]  You said you ate four in ten minutes.
[13:53.080 --> 13:53.320]  Yeah.
[13:53.620 --> 13:54.720]  So you were not pacing yourself.
[13:54.920 --> 13:56.920]  No, why would I? This is going to be easy.
[13:57.040 --> 13:58.540]  After four hours, you were at 11.
[13:58.860 --> 14:02.100]  Yeah, I just started... I mean, the first few were no problem.
[14:03.460 --> 14:08.120]  Then I hit five or six and it became a problem pretty quickly.
[14:08.840 --> 14:11.140]  It was filling and the taste... it was so bad.
[14:11.180 --> 14:12.260]  And they started getting cold.
[14:12.800 --> 14:14.980]  I didn't project how bad a cold burger would be.
[14:14.980 --> 14:19.880]  Couldn't you have just put the oven to maybe 100 degrees and just left them in there?
[14:20.340 --> 14:24.700]  You want me to put 44 burgers in the oven at 100 degrees?
[14:25.400 --> 14:27.600]  This is $50 on the line, Andrew.
[14:27.960 --> 14:29.760]  Yeah, but I've already spent $97.
[14:30.120 --> 14:32.260]  Exactly! You've got to recoup some of your loss.
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.840]  I'm going down $47, no matter what.
[14:35.340 --> 14:35.960]  That was bad.
[14:36.400 --> 14:37.780]  And it just kept getting worse.
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.660]  At eight or nine, it was terrible.
[14:41.220 --> 14:42.320]  And I laid down.
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.920]  At that point, that was the first time I thought,
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.680]  I'm going to look into strategy for this.
[14:47.200 --> 14:48.560]  I felt just so full.
[14:48.940 --> 14:53.260]  I was laying down and I watched a video of this professional eater
[14:53.260 --> 14:56.420]  and he was explaining how they eat large amounts of food.
[14:56.540 --> 14:57.980]  Was it like Matt Stonie or someone?
[14:58.240 --> 14:59.680]  I don't remember who it was.
[15:00.080 --> 15:03.960]  But it essentially came down to, you have a limited amount of space.
[15:04.080 --> 15:05.540]  So once you're out of space, you're out of space.
[15:05.640 --> 15:08.580]  So this is what you need to do to create more space before you do anything.
[15:08.580 --> 15:12.000]  And once I had that realization, I was like, this is...
[15:12.000 --> 15:12.820]  I'm not hitting 50.
[15:13.440 --> 15:13.980]  This is bad.
[15:14.360 --> 15:15.660]  Where do you create the space?
[15:15.880 --> 15:17.060]  With an enema, I assume.
[15:17.780 --> 15:20.040]  I mean, I guess I could have tried that.
[15:20.120 --> 15:23.840]  I mean, I looked into how long it takes for burgers to digest.
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.800]  And I wouldn't have the amount of time required to get a full clear.
[15:30.940 --> 15:33.240]  But I mean, I think it's sort of inspirational.
[15:33.360 --> 15:34.620]  I just kept soldiering away.
[15:34.940 --> 15:37.580]  I kept hammering away, doing my best for the whole 10 hours.
[15:37.580 --> 15:41.640]  Even though I had no chance, I'd say, after the first two hours.
[15:42.340 --> 15:45.240]  Also, Gavin fucking renegotiated down to 10 hours.
[15:45.720 --> 15:49.020]  We started at 12, and then he renegotiated 10.
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.800]  Wait, did I want 10?
[15:51.080 --> 15:52.620]  Yeah, you wanted it down to 10.
[15:52.680 --> 15:53.900]  You're like, ah, that looks too easy.
[15:54.440 --> 15:56.340]  And you negotiated down to 10.
[15:56.740 --> 16:00.700]  Andrew, that's something you should know before you enter into any bet with Gavin.
[16:00.860 --> 16:06.700]  He will very quickly, very willingly enter into a bet with you over almost anything.
[16:06.700 --> 16:10.340]  And oftentimes, a ridiculous sum of money on his end.
[16:10.660 --> 16:13.780]  Once you take the bet, the wheels start to spin.
[16:14.060 --> 16:15.740]  He realizes he's on the hook.
[16:15.840 --> 16:18.640]  Then he starts to backpedal.
[16:19.140 --> 16:22.700]  And that's when the price goes down and the requirements go up.
[16:22.880 --> 16:23.660]  100% of the time.
[16:23.960 --> 16:25.660]  Every time you got to be prepared for that with Gavin.
[16:25.860 --> 16:26.620]  Oh, here's what happened.
[16:26.760 --> 16:27.220]  Here's what happened.
[16:27.320 --> 16:28.560]  I clearly lost concentration.
[16:29.240 --> 16:30.140]  You sent me the picture.
[16:30.220 --> 16:31.380]  We'd been talking about 12 hours.
[16:31.480 --> 16:32.540]  I said, shit, that looks doable.
[16:33.060 --> 16:33.960]  Are you going to do it in waves?
[16:34.040 --> 16:36.300]  Or will it be a constant flow throughout the 10 hours?
[16:36.980 --> 16:40.960]  And I just, I guess, just changed the number there because I wasn't paying attention.
[16:41.220 --> 16:44.620]  And then you were throwing a hissy fit.
[16:46.020 --> 16:48.580]  The bet was that I had 12 hours.
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.600]  But now that Mr. Rules and Regulations shows up to see the photo, I will do it in 10.
[16:52.700 --> 16:54.080]  So you took that as a challenge.
[16:54.580 --> 16:56.960]  You didn't just say, nice typo, genius.
[16:57.260 --> 16:58.600]  You were like, no, I can do it in 10.
[16:58.700 --> 16:59.560]  So that's how that happened.
[16:59.780 --> 17:00.120]  Carry on.
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.500]  I don't think it was a typo.
[17:02.620 --> 17:03.580]  And also, I don't know.
[17:03.960 --> 17:05.800]  It's manipulation is what it is.
[17:05.800 --> 17:07.140]  It felt like I was lying to you.
[17:08.100 --> 17:10.820]  I would have never agreed to that if I had a burger first.
[17:11.860 --> 17:13.720]  That was in my complete confidence.
[17:13.920 --> 17:15.000]  I thought I'd do it in like eight.
[17:15.260 --> 17:16.120]  So where did it end up?
[17:16.460 --> 17:17.280]  31 burgers.
[17:17.700 --> 17:19.400]  I ate 31 burgers over the 10 hours.
[17:19.900 --> 17:21.560]  That's really not bad.
[17:22.140 --> 17:23.140]  No, it's pretty impressive.
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.340]  The one additional is impressive to me.
[17:26.400 --> 17:27.820]  The fact that you didn't just call it a 30.
[17:28.020 --> 17:30.300]  You were like, I'll do one more.
[17:31.380 --> 17:33.840]  Yeah, I just, I wanted to do as many as I could.
[17:33.840 --> 17:35.520]  As I said, it's an inspiration.
[17:35.880 --> 17:36.760]  I didn't quit.
[17:37.620 --> 17:40.540]  Were you still, like, set the stage.
[17:40.860 --> 17:42.940]  You have 10 minutes left.
[17:43.320 --> 17:43.960]  I was still eating.
[17:44.180 --> 17:47.860]  You're sitting on your bed surrounded by hamburger wrappers.
[17:48.380 --> 17:51.560]  And what, like 22 or 23 burgers left?
[17:51.620 --> 17:54.320]  And you're like, how many can I cram in in the last 10 minutes?
[17:54.980 --> 17:57.240]  Yeah, no, I was consistently eating.
[17:57.380 --> 17:58.360]  I'd take little breaks.
[17:58.620 --> 18:01.840]  And then I would have, I'd maybe stop for like 30, 40 minutes.
[18:01.880 --> 18:03.200]  And I'd kind of get a second wind.
[18:03.200 --> 18:05.420]  And then I'd eat two burgers and I'd feel great.
[18:05.500 --> 18:06.720]  And then it would hit me again.
[18:07.060 --> 18:08.160]  It was just like a constant.
[18:08.700 --> 18:10.920]  It was almost like waves of like, this is the worst thing ever.
[18:11.040 --> 18:11.900]  I could do this.
[18:12.000 --> 18:12.840]  I can eat two more.
[18:13.540 --> 18:15.740]  And it was like that the entire 10 hours.
[18:16.160 --> 18:18.420]  We, I also have the discussion here of after you lost.
[18:18.600 --> 18:21.060]  You said, since I lost and now owe you $50.
[18:21.940 --> 18:25.280]  However, the world has entered a pandemic and the economy is collapsing.
[18:26.220 --> 18:29.420]  In this Mad Max world, a $50 bill is useless.
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.140]  And then you went on to try and find something that might be worth more, buddy.
[18:33.200 --> 18:40.460]  You came up with a signed Coolio card for the 2003 Ben Affleck Daredevil movie.
[18:40.940 --> 18:45.100]  That is, hey, that is not the most easily gettable card that's set.
[18:45.240 --> 18:47.440]  Which to this day, you never sent me.
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.360]  No, well, we are going to talk about that, but you never responded first of all.
[18:52.420 --> 18:54.240]  So I assume there was no Coolio interest.
[18:54.820 --> 18:56.860]  Second of all, that's a great collectible.
[18:56.940 --> 18:58.060]  He's not even in that movie.
[18:58.260 --> 18:59.820]  He had one scene and they cut it.
[18:59.820 --> 19:03.920]  So it's an autographed card for a movie that the person isn't even in.
[19:04.100 --> 19:07.020]  Coolio has no involvement with the actual film.
[19:07.140 --> 19:09.640]  That must be worth way more than $50.
[19:10.020 --> 19:10.880]  I would love that thing.
[19:11.560 --> 19:12.260]  It's great.
[19:12.440 --> 19:14.300]  Yeah, you should, you probably find online.
[19:14.420 --> 19:18.260]  I think it might be worth $5 is the retail evaluation.
[19:18.680 --> 19:23.520]  Look, as an aside, sidebar, we've talked about building this,
[19:23.620 --> 19:27.240]  the world's best collectible guide or the like the best list of collectibles.
[19:27.240 --> 19:31.100]  So far, it's got Billy Ripken's 1989 Fleer F*** Face card on it.
[19:31.180 --> 19:34.540]  I nominate the second card to be an autographed Coolio
[19:34.540 --> 19:37.780]  Ben Affleck Daredevil 2003 trading card.
[19:37.960 --> 19:39.220]  I think it deserves to be there.
[19:39.560 --> 19:41.820]  I mean, what do you think?
[19:42.120 --> 19:44.040]  I think the Coolio one is way better.
[19:44.420 --> 19:45.320]  You think Coolio is better?
[19:45.660 --> 19:47.680]  I think we should. I think it deserves to be on the list.
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.480]  I'm a big fan of his work on the Keenan & Carroll theme song.
[19:51.640 --> 19:54.200]  We're all a big fan of all of Coolio's work.
[19:54.400 --> 19:54.580]  Yeah.
[19:54.840 --> 19:56.200]  Let's be serious. Let's be honest.
[19:56.200 --> 20:03.820]  He used to do that f***ing MTV show that was like MTV's horror show where they would...
[20:03.820 --> 20:05.060]  It was kind of like our ghost hunting show.
[20:05.720 --> 20:07.280]  I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head,
[20:07.860 --> 20:10.640]  but he was really great in it on the like the celebrity version of it.
[20:10.820 --> 20:12.060]  He's a cool dude, that Coolio.
[20:12.520 --> 20:15.800]  I don't doubt it. Great autograph. Give him credit for that.
[20:15.800 --> 20:20.280]  I feel like... was Gangster's Paradise even more popular than the Stevie Wonder song?
[20:20.680 --> 20:20.940]  Yes.
[20:21.500 --> 20:22.640]  What was the Stevie Wonder song?
[20:23.600 --> 20:24.040]  Uh...
[20:24.520 --> 20:26.560]  It's a song called Past Time Paradise.
[20:27.160 --> 20:32.200]  I don't know. I mean, I don't think any of us are old enough to remember. I don't know.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.600]  It was a popular song though.
[20:34.020 --> 20:37.020]  But it's Gangster's Paradise, but without someone rapping.
[20:38.780 --> 20:41.220]  Oh, it's just like the instrumental is a Stevie Wonder song?
[20:41.540 --> 20:42.960]  No, it's like a song. Like he says...
[20:43.840 --> 20:45.460]  Like the chorus is Stevie Wonder.
[20:45.580 --> 20:46.520]  Living in a past time paradise.
[20:46.980 --> 20:47.540]  Yeah, there you go.
[20:48.040 --> 20:48.100]  Yeah.
[20:48.200 --> 20:51.460]  No, but I'm saying Gangster's Paradise took the instrumental from that.
[20:51.460 --> 20:58.520]  It took the music and then he had like a choir sing the chorus that Stevie Wonder sang.
[20:58.880 --> 21:01.460]  And then he did some rapping over it.
[21:01.860 --> 21:06.660]  And then Michelle Pfeiffer turned a chair around and got tough on students.
[21:07.280 --> 21:07.680]  That's true.
[21:08.160 --> 21:11.840]  What Batman movie was she in? She's in a Batman movie, right?
[21:12.220 --> 21:13.020]  Yeah, she was Catwoman.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.760]  And what one though? Do you remember?
[21:14.940 --> 21:18.140]  Uh... Batman 2, the one with Danny DeVito as the Joker.
[21:18.440 --> 21:19.980]  Or I'm sorry, Danny DeVito as the Penguin.
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.560]  As Chester Cobblepot.
[21:21.940 --> 21:25.540]  I think to the list of dumb collectibles, I would...
[21:25.540 --> 21:28.240]  And they're so hard to get, but there's a Batman and Robin set
[21:28.240 --> 21:33.380]  that has like George Clooney autos, Arnold Schwarzenegger has an auto on that, Joel Schumacher.
[21:34.140 --> 21:35.600]  That'd be a hell of a get for any of those.
[21:35.600 --> 21:41.260]  Listen, we should sit down and put some serious effort into figuring out what these official...
[21:41.260 --> 21:42.920]  what the official collectible list will be.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.800]  Because I want to throw the Menendez Brothers basketball card in there.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.200]  There was a really cool photo of a baseball player from the Phillies
[21:49.200 --> 21:53.280]  that was on Reddit the other day that was nominated as the coolest baseball card of all time.
[21:55.060 --> 21:59.480]  But we're getting too... we're straying too far away from hamburgers right now.
[21:59.680 --> 22:01.040]  We are. Should we go back to hamburgers?
[22:01.440 --> 22:05.440]  Yeah, because I have one thing I'd like to point out when you're totally done.
[22:05.820 --> 22:07.700]  I just have one addendum I'd like to add.
[22:07.920 --> 22:10.780]  Okay, well this is... we're about to go to a second part.
[22:10.960 --> 22:13.800]  So is it tied to the hamburger or do you want to wait until the end?
[22:13.980 --> 22:15.140]  It's tied to hamburgers.
[22:15.320 --> 22:15.920]  Okay, go ahead.
[22:15.920 --> 22:17.560]  I was just going to say, this happened in March.
[22:17.560 --> 22:19.960]  You attempted to eat 50 hamburgers.
[22:20.400 --> 22:21.900]  Failed. Valiant effort.
[22:22.660 --> 22:27.220]  It apparently had no long-term effect on you because yesterday I found out
[22:27.220 --> 22:32.140]  you won a Microsoft Surface by spinning a wheel trying to win more hamburgers.
[22:32.280 --> 22:33.360]  That's true. I guess I'm up.
[22:33.880 --> 22:36.660]  I guess my passion for hamburgers... I mean, if you look into that,
[22:36.720 --> 22:39.160]  that's like a $550 tablet.
[22:39.680 --> 22:40.080]  I'm up.
[22:40.920 --> 22:41.860]  That's a great point, Geoff.
[22:42.000 --> 22:42.360]  Thanks.
[22:42.780 --> 22:44.860]  Andrew, you're a hamburger obsession.
[22:45.120 --> 22:46.160]  It's getting out of control, buddy.
[22:46.160 --> 22:50.760]  I don't know if it's an obsession, but I'd say my pursuit of the joy of a simple burger
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.820]  has led me down some bad roads and some good roads, and I'm up right now.
[22:55.000 --> 22:55.800]  Here's what we need to do.
[22:55.900 --> 22:56.340]  I can make several of these bets.
[22:56.920 --> 22:59.200]  We're obviously going to have this collectible list.
[22:59.300 --> 23:02.980]  This show is very quickly spinning out into being bigger than the three of us.
[23:05.300 --> 23:11.260]  It's obvious to me that we need to develop the world's leading monkey movie
[23:12.580 --> 23:14.000]  rating scale and guide.
[23:14.260 --> 23:15.400]  Obviously, we need to do that.
[23:15.400 --> 23:17.260]  I was thinking about Congo the other day.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.560]  Amy Walt Raindrop Drink.
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.040]  There's so many great monkey movies.
[23:20.480 --> 23:27.320]  Now, I'm thinking we need Andrew's guide to the best burgers in Canada or the world.
[23:28.400 --> 23:29.260]  But we don't have to do that today.
[23:29.440 --> 23:30.260]  Something to think about.
[23:30.460 --> 23:36.300]  What if we just made it on my island so it was useless to 99% of people that see the list?
[23:36.760 --> 23:37.020]  That'd be great.
[23:37.040 --> 23:37.600]  That's even better to me.
[23:37.700 --> 23:40.240]  I mean, it won't be useless to Gavin and I when we come for the bathtub race.
[23:40.480 --> 23:40.780]  That's true.
[23:40.920 --> 23:41.120]  That's true.
[23:41.220 --> 23:42.640]  When we're there, we'll use it.
[23:47.760 --> 23:48.280]  And we'll use it.
[23:48.280 --> 23:51.240]  This episode is brought to you by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery.
[23:51.580 --> 23:55.080]  The Grateful Dead and Dogfish Head have gotten the band back together with the

[25:15.460 --> 25:19.320]  Even though you and most of the septuagenarian and octogenarian,
[25:20.060 --> 25:24.920]  disciplinarian, authoritarian, rotarian, octarians of said secret organization
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.420]  know how cool and super sexy collectible teaspoons and thimbles are,
[25:30.080 --> 25:34.520]  I mean, as an aside, if you have ever held, uh, I don't know, I'm just gonna,
[25:34.680 --> 25:37.680]  off the top of my head, uh, not thinking of anything in specific, but, uh,
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.380]  maybe a gilded and rose-stained ceramic thimble commemorating the June 7th
[25:41.380 --> 25:43.540]  pilot episode airing of The Archers on BBC.
[25:43.540 --> 25:46.860]  If you've ever held that in your hand, tell me that's not sexy.
[25:47.060 --> 25:47.980]  You can't do it.
[25:48.220 --> 25:49.980]  Anyway, back to the hypotheticals.
[25:50.180 --> 25:54.720]  Let's say that lots and lots of people do not understand how cool it is to be a
[25:54.720 --> 25:59.260]  member of a highly coveted organization of said septuagenarian and octogenarian,
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.920]  disciplinarian, authoritarian, rotarian, octarians, and have no appreciation
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.740]  that someone as young as 45, somebody as young as me, 45, sure, why not,
[26:09.020 --> 26:13.040]  could even be accepted into their highly prized and secretive ranks.
[26:13.640 --> 26:15.520]  So you prefer to keep it on the down-low.
[26:16.020 --> 26:18.360]  Now you can, thanks to ExpressVPN.
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.000]  I know most of you are probably thinking, well, if you would like to hide the
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.660]  fact that you're a member of a largely septuagenarian and octogenarian,
[26:26.820 --> 26:32.680]  disciplinarian, authoritarian, rotarian, octarians, hell-bent on collecting only
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.860]  the most prized commemorative teaspoons and thimbles, both metal and porcelain,
[26:38.180 --> 26:41.780]  on planet Earth, do you think incognito mode would probably be good enough to
[26:41.780 --> 26:42.360]  hide that, right?
[26:42.960 --> 26:45.760]  You know, kind of keep those movements to yourself, but it doesn't hide your
[26:45.760 --> 26:46.120]  activity.
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.460]  It doesn't matter what mode you use or how many times you clear your browsing
[26:50.460 --> 26:54.540]  history, your internet service provider can still see every single website
[26:54.540 --> 27:01.320]  you've visited, even a certain forum largely populated by a certain
[27:01.320 --> 27:08.120]  collectible community of people who are maybe in the 70 to 80-year-old range
[27:08.120 --> 27:15.440]  who are shrewd and prefer to keep their very private and top-secret
[27:15.440 --> 27:17.220]  transactions to themselves.
[27:17.540 --> 27:20.940]  That service provider can still see that's going on.
[27:21.200 --> 27:22.060]  I mean, come on.
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.000]  This is why when I'm at home, I never go online without using ExpressVPN.
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.800]  Not that I go to those forums, and not that I am a member of said septuagenarian
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.820]  and octogenarian, disciplinarian, authoritarian, rotarian, octarian
[27:35.820 --> 27:42.240]  collectors of certain prized artifacts from the 1920s up until, let's say,
[27:42.300 --> 27:43.800]  1968 or so.
[27:44.300 --> 27:49.560]  Not that I'm a member of that organization or any organization therein of
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.020]  similar stature or interest, but if I was, I would probably join it and
[27:54.020 --> 27:56.520]  frequent it via an ExpressVPN connection.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.280]  ExpressVPN also keeps your information secure by encrypting 100% of your
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.180]  Spoon and Thimble-related data with the most powerful encryption possible.
[28:05.180 --> 28:08.040]  Most of the time, I don't even realize I'm using ExpressVPN.
[28:08.400 --> 28:12.080]  It just kind of runs seamlessly in the background and I don't have to worry
[28:12.080 --> 28:12.420]  about it.
[28:12.480 --> 28:16.160]  It's very easy to use and all you have to do is tap one button and you're

[28:21.000 --> 28:21.580]  smart TV.

[28:59.860 --> 29:03.320]  Okay, so I lose. I lose the burger bets.
[29:03.940 --> 29:07.400]  As you know, I tried to sell Gavin the Coolio card. I tried to convince him.
[29:07.920 --> 29:08.960]  That did not work.
[29:09.260 --> 29:12.320]  I don't know why I didn't reply. I assume you were messaging me while I was recording
[29:12.320 --> 29:16.140]  and I just never came back to you. But I somehow want to get hold of that.
[29:16.540 --> 29:18.200]  Well, it's off the table now. It's gone.
[29:18.400 --> 29:19.600]  Okay, I missed the window, huh?
[29:19.820 --> 29:21.040]  You missed the window. It's closed.
[29:21.420 --> 29:24.520]  So what are you going to... now that that's off the table, what are you going to replace
[29:24.520 --> 29:26.900]  the $50 of value that you still owe me?
[29:26.900 --> 29:31.300]  No, this is what you don't know, Gavin. I had a whole plan worked out.
[29:31.840 --> 29:34.700]  I came up with this whole thing. What I did, because I care.
[29:34.880 --> 29:38.980]  I don't like owing people stuff. I care. If I owe you something, I will pay you back.
[29:39.500 --> 29:40.600]  It's important to me.
[29:40.600 --> 29:41.300]  Sure, yeah.
[29:41.700 --> 29:45.700]  And also, but we live in different places and just mailing money through the mail,
[29:45.780 --> 29:46.800]  that seems dangerous.
[29:47.060 --> 29:48.440]  Well, especially with your mail problems.
[29:48.620 --> 29:51.020]  It's not like services like Venmo exist.
[29:51.180 --> 29:53.420]  No, I don't know. What's a Venmo?
[29:54.080 --> 29:57.040]  It's a bunch of letters together. I don't know what that is.
[29:57.900 --> 29:58.200]  Fair enough.
[29:58.600 --> 30:03.540]  So I thought, oh, I want to send this to Gavin because I care about him and I owe him this $50,
[30:04.020 --> 30:10.320]  but I also, I want to make sure it's safe. So what I did was I bought four different safes online
[30:10.320 --> 30:16.060]  of different sizes. I bought this really tiny safe that was intended for if you're in a casino
[30:16.060 --> 30:19.040]  and you don't trust yourself, you can just slide the money in there.
[30:19.040 --> 30:25.780]  So I put, I got one of those. I put a nice 50 in for you. Then I bought a slightly bigger safe
[30:26.300 --> 30:31.540]  and I put the small safe in that safe. Then I bought another slightly bigger safe,
[30:31.880 --> 30:37.560]  put that safe in that safe. Then I bought a bigger like hotel safe with the electric lock
[30:37.560 --> 30:42.900]  and I put all the safes in there. And then I locked it. No, I didn't just lock it up because
[30:42.900 --> 30:48.500]  I care about you, Gavin, and I care about you getting your money. So then I bought 500 keys
[30:48.500 --> 30:55.920]  off of eBay and had them shipped to my house. And I took the keys for the safe and all the
[30:55.920 --> 31:02.140]  other safes and I threw them all in the big safe. So there's 500 keys and then four safes.
[31:02.220 --> 31:08.260]  Then I locked up the safe and I was all ready to send it to you. And then the world entered a
[31:08.260 --> 31:13.240]  pandemic. But yeah, that's going to cost like 600 bucks to send through the mail. It's going
[31:13.240 --> 31:19.180]  to be heavy as shit. It's well, yeah, it's over 20 pounds. I have weighed it. It's a matryoshka
[31:19.180 --> 31:25.860]  doll of safes and keys. Oh my God. It sounds it's horrifying to move. It is very heavy,
[31:26.280 --> 31:32.180]  weighs over 20 pounds. And my plan was I'm going to send this to you and then I'm going to sell
[31:32.180 --> 31:37.540]  you the combination so you could get your money back. So I would end up equal. That was the idea.
[31:38.060 --> 31:43.620]  I'd slowly sell you parts of the combination. Then you'd open it and a fucking boatload of
[31:43.620 --> 31:48.280]  keys would pour out and then they'd be great. It'd be hilarious. It'd be a win for me.
[31:49.180 --> 31:54.340]  That was the plan. I'm so mad this never happened. That was the plan. How much would
[31:54.340 --> 31:58.380]  you have charged for the combination number? Oh, I don't know. I didn't figure that out.
[31:59.100 --> 32:03.460]  Yeah. No, I think I'd do one at a time and I'd be like 10. And it's a very specific combination.
[32:03.460 --> 32:07.700]  I was going to leave clues. I filled it with Garfield cards too. A bunch of Garfield
[32:07.700 --> 32:14.460]  collectible cards. It was the whole thing. It's 20 pounds of disaster. But then the world
[32:14.460 --> 32:19.840]  entered a pandemic. Nobody could go outside. So I had this safe just in the corner of my room,
[32:19.880 --> 32:27.020]  this 20 pound bullshit safe just for weeks. And then you had to move house? And then I had to
[32:27.020 --> 32:33.360]  move and I had to physically move this 20 pound safe. I've definitely lost at this point.
[32:34.100 --> 32:39.540]  I still have the safe. So that turned into you f***ing yourself. Oh, absolutely. When you were
[32:39.540 --> 32:43.700]  trying to f***ing face me. Yeah, a hundred percent blew up in my face. I didn't predict
[32:43.700 --> 32:50.340]  a pandemic happening. It really set me back. Shit. I'm going to die. That's awesome.
[32:50.980 --> 32:55.300]  It's a great plan, right? Four safes. That's a great plan. Russian dolling you with the safes.
[32:56.940 --> 33:00.720]  They're good safes too. These are not low quality safes.
[33:03.460 --> 33:09.320]  I'm so stupid. I never even considered just mailing the keys to the office and having someone
[33:09.320 --> 33:14.340]  build the safe for me. That was a realization later. Once I realized it was 20 pounds,
[33:14.420 --> 33:17.040]  I was like, this is going to be... Prefabricated this whole thing and then
[33:17.040 --> 33:19.880]  you yourself have to front the cost. You could have sent it to me,
[33:20.000 --> 33:25.960]  dickhead. I could have done it. Yeah, I know you could have. Yeah, I should have. I just didn't
[33:25.960 --> 33:30.200]  think about that. And then I weighed it and I was like, this is going to cost a billion dollars.
[33:30.200 --> 33:35.340]  This is... I need to figure out a way to make this work. But then the pandemic happened,
[33:35.440 --> 33:39.380]  so I didn't have to figure it out. It's just... I'm going to have this 20 pound
[33:39.380 --> 33:43.860]  bullshit safe filled with keys for months. Filled with keys and safes.
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.900]  The worst part is it would be hard for me to even get the 50 out. I don't know where the keys are.
[33:48.260 --> 33:53.720]  I put the keys in the safe. I can't even pull the money out. So I'm currently just withholding
[33:53.720 --> 33:58.680]  money from myself. I've locked myself out of this whole thing. But on a rainy day,
[33:58.680 --> 34:02.820]  you know, there's 50 waiting for you. That's true. That'll be a frustrating
[34:02.820 --> 34:13.400]  day though when I need that 50. I'm imagining you like taking a cab or something and you don't have
[34:13.400 --> 34:17.800]  any cash and you're like, hold on, I'll go in and I know where $50 is. And it takes you like four
[34:17.800 --> 34:22.700]  hours to get to it. What if I go to like a casino and just put the safe down to like the table?
[34:23.500 --> 34:27.160]  I want 50 on red. It's in here. Trust me. Don't worry about it. It's in there.
[34:29.760 --> 34:33.920]  Wow. Honestly, that story went in a completely different direction than I thought it was going.
[34:33.980 --> 34:38.800]  I had no idea about any of that. I can't believe you've been holding on to that since March.
[34:40.720 --> 34:44.740]  I figured I was going to send it to you and it could have been a video or something, but it's
[34:44.740 --> 34:49.940]  like no one's going to be in a place like in a public, like in an office until it feels like
[34:49.940 --> 34:54.400]  2025. Would you have let me, instead of paying for the combination, would you have let me
[34:54.400 --> 35:01.360]  complete smaller tasks? Like what? Like instead of me paying you like $10 per number of the
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.980]  combination. Well, what would be like a smaller task? Like it may be, depending on what the task
[35:05.980 --> 35:11.040]  is. Like, I don't know, like just little bets where if I complete them, I don't have to pay
[35:11.040 --> 35:14.240]  you the money. Because I kind of want to, I don't want to be, I don't want to break even or be,
[35:14.620 --> 35:19.620]  you know, in loss from this. Like draw a penis on your forehead with sunscreen and then go
[35:19.620 --> 35:24.440]  lay outside for 30 minutes is, uh, yeah, it's like two keys or something or two combinations.
[35:24.820 --> 35:30.400]  Or go and like run a fart into, uh, into Austin. I didn't consider that, but I think if you would
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.320]  have approached me with it, I definitely would have been open to it. That's good. Nothing wrong
[35:34.320 --> 35:40.620]  with that. Yeah. I like that we've negotiated this at every available point to the point where it's
[35:40.620 --> 35:46.040]  not even, it's not anywhere near what we started with the $50 for burgers thing. I feel like though,
[35:46.040 --> 35:51.700]  guys, I feel like this perfectly illustrates the need for this podcast, right? This is what it's
[35:51.700 --> 35:55.580]  like. It's what, this is what it's been like for the three of us to be friends for five or six
[35:55.580 --> 36:02.300]  years now. And it's virtually impossible to capture or film. It always goes wrong or goes awry. And
[36:02.300 --> 36:05.820]  then you're like, well, that was the funniest thing nobody will ever get to find out about.
[36:06.500 --> 36:12.140]  Goddamn. Yeah. Or just even like, sometimes it doesn't even occur to me to share this on
[36:12.140 --> 36:17.480]  public level. Like I've been doing stuff like this for over a decade. Yeah. Honestly, if I,
[36:17.620 --> 36:22.200]  I just need to like keep our Slack conversations or print them or something because it's just
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.660]  golden. Like I just scrolled, I just scrolled past some other random conversation. The next is,
[36:27.880 --> 36:34.100]  shitting would require four steps. Oh, yeah. That's just from another thing that you were doing.
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.580]  Yeah. That was fun. That's one of my favorite things you've done in a while. It's a fucking
[36:39.580 --> 36:43.580]  achievement in the orange box too. Is it really? I was thinking about that the other day. Yeah.
[36:43.800 --> 36:48.360]  Yeah. It's in, uh, it's in portal one, I believe. Oh God. Do you remember? Those portal
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.220]  achievements were awful. Yeah. It was like beat all this stuff without, with barely walking and
[36:53.220 --> 36:57.420]  you just like floating up and down through portals to the end. It's like beat a level in less than
[36:57.420 --> 37:03.740]  nine steps or something. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, they had those in portal still alive. Yeah. Those suck.
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.180]  I want to go back and finish the orange box. I never did that. They're in orange box too. I
[37:08.180 --> 37:11.760]  think they're the only ones that are missing from orange box is those crazy portals. Gavin got a
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.020]  shitload of achievements in orange box. I remember being jealous of that at the time. I like games
[37:16.020 --> 37:20.640]  where there's just a shitload of achievements. Like orange box is great. Master chief collection
[37:20.640 --> 37:27.120]  has like 700 achievements. Yeah. You would love gems of war. It has 4,000 fucking achievements
[37:27.520 --> 37:31.920]  and they're all impossible. I'm so stupid. I thought you were literal. I'm dumb. Ignore me.
[37:32.160 --> 37:35.500]  When you said fourth, I was like, wait a second. That's not, I know master chief collection has
[37:35.500 --> 37:40.780]  most 700, 4,000 doesn't even make sense. I'm an idiot. Jesus. Yeah. I apologize. It's okay though.
[37:40.860 --> 37:44.920]  It's part of your charm. I, uh, yeah, I want to get the orange box because it had the most
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.320]  achievements on the three 60. I think it has 99 and then master chief collection is the most on
[37:50.320 --> 37:54.920]  the Xbox one. So I'd like the a hundred percent, the games that had the most achievements on both
[37:54.920 --> 38:00.860]  generations. I want to see now how many, how many did I get in orange box? I think you're like 80
[38:00.860 --> 38:04.420]  something. I've looked at it. I think you were down to like some bullshit. Some of the team
[38:04.420 --> 38:07.920]  Fortress stuff you didn't, you didn't get. Yeah. You also have the team Fortress two stuff. That's
[38:07.920 --> 38:13.320]  still, still going. You could still get that thousand kills or whatever, dude. I bet the people
[38:13.320 --> 38:19.940]  that are still playing team Fortress two on the Xbox three 60 are fucking good. Like their life,
[38:20.260 --> 38:24.440]  their life progress in their life stopped when that game came out and they're still going strong.
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.940]  They'd fucking ignored the fact that team Fortress two became an entirely different game on the PC
[38:29.940 --> 38:33.840]  and all of that. And they're still just plugging away at that core game. I bet they're phenomenal.
[38:34.620 --> 38:38.960]  Do you think there's one person just sitting in the lobby waiting, waiting months for someone?
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.480]  It's probably like the dude that we met in 50 cent blood on the sand that time. Yeah. I was
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.240]  actually as about to talk about that. One of my biggest regrets in video games is not being able
[38:50.240 --> 38:56.240]  to 100% 50 cent blood on the sand. When I played through it in like two days, I got all the
[38:56.240 --> 39:01.140]  collectibles. I did everything. The only achievements I'm missing. Phenomenal game. It's a fantastic
[39:01.140 --> 39:06.200]  game. But the achievements I'm missing are the play as the co-op character. I hosted all of our
[39:06.200 --> 39:10.500]  sessions. So you have all those achievements. I didn't get any of them. It's the only thing
[39:10.500 --> 39:16.600]  I'm missing. I thought for sure the 50 cent blood on the sand servers have long died. There's no
[39:16.600 --> 39:21.120]  way I looked. You have to get them online. There's no local option. I was disappointed.
[39:21.280 --> 39:25.940]  I was sad for years. I could never do this. I just found out that they're still going.
[39:25.940 --> 39:31.760]  Are you serious? You could still play 50 cent blood on the sand on an Xbox 360. The premise
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.920]  of that game has to be the best premise of any video game I have ever played. Do you remember
[39:36.920 --> 39:45.540]  it, Andrew? Vaguely, it has to do with he does a show, right? Yeah, 50 cent and the G unit,
[39:45.620 --> 39:50.620]  the whole G unit. They go to somewhere in the Middle East. I think to like a fake country,
[39:50.920 --> 39:54.660]  but it may have been a real country. I could be misremembering. And they're going to play a concert
[39:54.660 --> 40:01.780]  and his payment is a diamond skull, I believe, like a skull made out of diamonds. And then a
[40:01.780 --> 40:09.180]  terrorist group steals it. And then 50 cent and like Warren G or whoever. I don't know if the game
[40:09.180 --> 40:14.520]  was in the G unit back then or what. Then it's then it turns into Gears of War and it's a two
[40:14.520 --> 40:21.580]  player cover based third person shooter to kill the terrorists to reclaim 50 cents diamond skull
[40:21.580 --> 40:26.560]  so he can get payment for his concert. I don't think there was any moral issue he had with the
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.920]  terrorists being terrorists. I think he simply wanted to be paid for his show was his motivation.
[40:31.660 --> 40:35.180]  I don't think he cared about anything beyond that. Yes. Yeah, he won payment for services rendered.
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.460]  That's all it's all 50 cent cared about. Is this the same game as the one where they added
[40:39.460 --> 40:46.720]  helicopters because of some kid? Yes. Yes, they had the 50 cent had brought his son who was like
[40:46.720 --> 40:52.320]  seven to like an early build of the game or like they're showing it off to him. And his son really
[40:52.320 --> 40:57.140]  liked helicopters. And his kid was like, there should be helicopters in this. I like helicopters.
[40:57.560 --> 41:02.180]  And 50 cents said, you heard the man put some helicopters in. So there's like four or five
[41:02.180 --> 41:06.940]  helicopter missions in that game just because the seven year old wanted it. And they are not good.
[41:07.300 --> 41:11.860]  They're probably the worst aspect of that game. They feel very forced and completely unnecessary.
[41:11.860 --> 41:17.520]  Dude, that's some power. I bet that was amazing. It's a great accomplishment. But yeah, I'm so
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.640]  excited. I'm going to go back. I don't it's a tough sell to get someone to plug in a 360
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.620]  and be willing to play through all of 50 cent blood on the sand. But is it not backwards
[41:27.620 --> 41:33.240]  compatible? Of course not. No. Oh, they don't feel like a pretty a licensing nightmare. I would
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.320]  happily do it with you, Andrew. But unfortunately, I don't own a 360 anymore. I haven't had I haven't
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.840]  seen one in years. You have the really cool one, though, don't you? Somewhere at Rooster Teeth. I
[41:42.840 --> 41:46.360]  don't know. I would I don't know what would have happened to it. I'm looking at my orange box
[41:46.360 --> 41:51.120]  progress. I'm missing six achievements. Three of them are the portal challenges. And then, yeah,
[41:51.140 --> 41:57.060]  I've got three from Team Fortress. Play with seven friends. Never got that. Accumulate a thousand
[41:57.060 --> 42:02.880]  kills. Never got that. Set five enemies on fire in 30 seconds. Never got that. And I never will.
[42:03.700 --> 42:08.520]  You're never going to go back. I don't think so. I also don't have a 360. I bet that one's
[42:08.520 --> 42:13.560]  backwards compatible. Oh, it might be. No. Yeah, it is. Orange box is backwards compatible. I just
[42:13.560 --> 42:18.820]  picked that up. That whole thing, that whole setup is fucking lame. I mean, I get it. It shouldn't
[42:18.820 --> 42:25.140]  work super well. But when Millie and I went back and played, I guess it was Halo 4 is the one
[42:25.140 --> 42:31.620]  that's not that's only available from on the 360. Is that right? No, they are all in the Master
[42:31.620 --> 42:37.720]  Chief collection, aren't they? Yeah, Halo 4 is in the MCC. Is it? Yeah. Yeah. Halo 5 isn't.
[42:38.380 --> 42:44.020]  Well, no, Halo 5 isn't. Halo 5 is Xbox One. I think, oh my God, I f***ing faced this.
[42:44.660 --> 42:50.700]  What do you mean? I thought Halo 4 wasn't in the MCC because it was fucking 343 not
[42:50.700 --> 42:55.780]  Bungie or something. And so Millie and I downloaded Halo 4, bought it, downloaded it.
[42:55.780 --> 43:00.080]  What? And played the entire game backwards compatible. We couldn't get into a lobby
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.760]  together. So she played as a guest. So she has no achievements in it. We played all of Halo 4
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.640]  together as her as a guest on my f***ing back. Oh my God. So when you're in MCC. Is it really in there?
[43:09.820 --> 43:14.780]  Like scrolling between Halo 1 and 2 and ODST. Did you not find it strange that you had to scroll
[43:14.780 --> 43:22.460]  over Halo 4 to get to ODST? I'll be honest. I don't think I ever saw it. I just don't think I ever saw
[43:22.460 --> 43:28.020]  it. It's not even like they added 4. 4's been in there since the launch. They added ODST. Well,
[43:28.020 --> 43:33.960]  I'm gonna have to go back and take a look at that. Goddamn it. So you were playing like the old
[43:33.960 --> 43:41.740]  probably 30 frames a second 720p version when there's a lovely 60 FPS full HD version there.
[43:41.880 --> 43:45.980]  Well, 4K probably now on there. And I paid to do it. Did you have all your component cables plugged
[43:45.980 --> 43:50.880]  in at least? Yeah, I did have all my component cables plugged in. I'm HDMI-ing. I just want to make sure.
[43:50.880 --> 43:51.760]  Okay, okay.
[43:54.260 --> 44:00.920]  So anyway, I have a question for you guys before we get on to Andrew's steps. I have just a quick
[44:00.920 --> 44:07.140]  minor question. Should I be concerned? I woke up the other morning and I felt like when I was
[44:07.140 --> 44:10.560]  getting out of bed, I felt like a hangnail on my toe. You know how you feel like a hangnail and
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.240]  you're like, oh. And so when I took out the covers, I thought I need to cut my toenail,
[44:14.680 --> 44:19.160]  my pinky toe, because I felt like it snagged for a second. And I looked down at my pinky toe
[44:19.160 --> 44:26.440]  and my entire toenail fell off. Oh God. It was just hanging by a thread and I touched it and
[44:26.440 --> 44:32.000]  it just fell off. And I don't have a pinky toe, toenail anymore. Is that something I should be
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.840]  concerned about? It just went away. It didn't hurt. I never like stubbed it or anything. It just
[44:37.340 --> 44:42.260]  exited from my body of its own volition. I feel like if it had been knocked off,
[44:42.340 --> 44:46.360]  I would have said that's fine. You know, that always happens. Well, not always, but that's
[44:46.360 --> 44:50.680]  not rare. The fact that it just gave up and jumped out of your foot, that's pretty weird.
[44:50.880 --> 44:56.840]  It abandoned ship with no pain. There's no hint of a toenail left. It's just weird,
[44:57.040 --> 45:02.440]  fleshy meat where a toenail used to be. Doesn't really hurt. Doesn't feel good. I don't touch it
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.600]  often. I just don't know what to do about that. Are you concerned about the implication of it?
[45:07.700 --> 45:13.200]  Yeah. Like, what if it's going to keep going? Like, what if you have no toenails in like seven
[45:13.200 --> 45:20.460]  months? If all my toenails start falling off, I assume that I'm dying. I don't know. I don't know
[45:20.460 --> 45:25.460]  what else to think. I think you're fine. I'm going to be scared every day when I wake up to
[45:25.460 --> 45:31.460]  look at my toes. It is disgusting. I mean, there was no blood or anything, but... But medically,
[45:31.620 --> 45:40.160]  I think you're fine. I broke a plate in my room recently, and I don't know where a broom is. I
[45:40.160 --> 45:44.820]  don't have a way to clean up like the little shards. And so my way of picking it up has been,
[45:44.900 --> 45:50.260]  I've just been randomly stepping on small pieces, like the last week, and then finding them that
[45:50.260 --> 45:55.760]  way. So I'm definitely, I'm not a good medical person. Do you have two pieces of notebook paper?
[45:56.580 --> 46:00.320]  Uh, no. No, I don't. Do you have two pieces of printer paper? No, I don't. Do you have a
[46:00.320 --> 46:04.700]  newspaper? No, I don't have a newspaper. Is there a... I know you have flyers for a Chinese restaurant
[46:04.700 --> 46:11.460]  in town. Oh, those are hidden... I was gonna call you Jake for some reason. No, please don't.
[46:11.460 --> 46:15.720]  That would be... Please don't do that. Wow. Don't do that. That would have been bad. How
[46:15.720 --> 46:20.040]  would you do that? That would be an insult. I thought we were friends. Come on. We are friends.
[46:20.380 --> 46:24.720]  Do you remember, this is a completely random detour. Gavin, do you remember when you helped me
[46:24.720 --> 46:30.820]  with the Spike Lee thing with Jake? How did I help? I convinced somebody I'm friends with that
[46:30.820 --> 46:36.080]  they were going to interview Spike Lee in Minecraft. And I said he was like doing the
[46:36.080 --> 46:41.040]  rounds and you guys were going to do an interview with him too. And so I had you tweet at him,
[46:41.140 --> 46:46.340]  good luck with your interview. Oh yeah. And to really sell, really sell it.
[46:48.200 --> 46:53.960]  Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah, it was pretty good. It was all bollocks. Yeah. How did that go?
[46:54.280 --> 46:59.880]  Uh, I had a fake Spike Lee and then like it was a whole thing and I pretended that there was like
[46:59.880 --> 47:03.740]  a voice issue and that's why he couldn't hear Spike Lee, because I don't know Spike Lee,
[47:03.840 --> 47:09.720]  so I couldn't get him involved in this. And then I had the Spike Lee leave the middle of the
[47:09.720 --> 47:13.980]  interview and then told him that it was because Spike Lee was offended by one of the questions
[47:14.600 --> 47:22.700]  and he changed his gamer tag to sorry Spike Lee to like try to amend. I paid for the change.
[47:22.900 --> 47:26.840]  I feel like that's important to say. I paid for both the change and the change back. I said the
[47:26.840 --> 47:32.780]  only way to appease the situation would be if you showed you were sorry by changing your name.
[47:33.340 --> 47:41.610]  You also filmed an apology video. That was a prank that I think two people watched. It was a Twitch
[47:41.610 --> 47:45.850]  stream. It was like all this work, but it was funny. There were two people watching live?
[47:46.350 --> 47:51.850]  Yeah, it was, but it was just people I know. I often, I often wonder if we should bring up,
[47:52.150 --> 47:57.710]  because of all the terrible things you or I or Gavin have done in our lives, I feel like none
[47:57.710 --> 48:06.190]  of them quite reached the level of just the average torture you, you submit your friend Jake to. And
[48:06.190 --> 48:11.570]  I always, I always wonder if we should bring it up or if it's too cruel. Like if it, like if you
[48:11.570 --> 48:16.170]  tell Jake stories and we find out it violates like the Geneva Convention or something. They're not
[48:16.170 --> 48:21.150]  that bad. They're all pretty funny. Yeah, I doubt there's war crimes. I don't know man, they're
[48:21.150 --> 48:25.910]  pretty funny. I don't know, we might lose the audience real fast. Oh, Jake and I are still
[48:25.910 --> 48:30.630]  friends. We're good friends. Does he know like the extent of all of the times you've messed with
[48:30.630 --> 48:35.050]  him though? Oh, yeah. Well, we always talk about it at the end. Yeah, it's never, I don't think
[48:35.050 --> 48:41.410]  there's been an ongoing, you know what? There is a stupid one. I guess the most ongoing one we did
[48:41.410 --> 48:46.630]  is he's such a big Rooster Teeth fan. And he was in college. And when he told us at one point
[48:46.630 --> 48:51.550]  that whenever he'd go to the cafeteria, he'd lose his cell phone signal. You wouldn't get any
[48:51.550 --> 48:57.530]  reception. And every time for like a month and a half, he would leave, we would just spam him
[48:57.530 --> 49:02.330]  like, Oh, Geoff just joined the party. Geoff joined the parties. He's talking. And he believed it.
[49:02.470 --> 49:08.050]  And he thought he had the most unlucky streak in the history of the world. He's like every
[49:08.050 --> 49:12.650]  fucking time. I don't care what I go for dinner. It always happens when I leave. It was great.
[49:14.210 --> 49:17.970]  I got a ban by a Hall of Fame tight end on Twitter and told him it was,
[49:18.490 --> 49:25.710]  that's the whole thing. We need an episode just for him. Yeah, we need a probably a fucking season
[49:25.710 --> 49:30.710]  or a year of Jake episodes. Goddamn, we're running up on time. Should we start the show?
[49:31.090 --> 49:35.950]  Yeah, yeah. Before you start the show, while you were talking there, I did look through
[49:35.950 --> 49:40.990]  Geoff's achievements in Master Chief Collection. And yeah, it goes like Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3,
[49:42.050 --> 49:45.910]  Halo ODST, Halo Reach, and all the Halo 4 achievements are just sat on,
[49:46.130 --> 49:50.010]  like sat locked. Like he's never touched the thing. You got a few multiplayer ones.
[49:55.330 --> 49:59.870]  I played every one of those games in the MCC. How didn't I see Halo 4?
[50:00.490 --> 50:04.010]  It's right there. It's always been there. It's been there for six years.
[50:05.590 --> 50:07.030]  Goddamn, I hate myself.
[50:07.030 --> 50:11.990]  Ugh. All right, can we start the show now? All right, should we stop? Yeah, hold on.
[50:12.610 --> 50:16.750]  Hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face. My name is Geoff Ramsey. As you know,
[50:16.870 --> 50:21.430]  this is a podcast about asset and wealth management. With me is Andrew Panton. And
[50:21.430 --> 50:26.310]  Andrew, I believe you had some particular insights into the Canadian ETF market you
[50:26.310 --> 50:31.070]  wanted to elucidate. What is the ETF? I have a lot of insights. Could you please
[50:31.070 --> 50:36.350]  remind me what the ETF is? I think we could just end it right there. Oh, you want to end it there?
[50:36.970 --> 50:41.890]  No sense. OK. Or we keep talking forever. I don't know. Yeah, we could keep talking. I mean,
[50:41.950 --> 50:45.110]  I've got a little bit of an update. We ended, we started. I think that was the end. I think
[50:45.110 --> 50:47.910]  I think it ends right after you stop talking. Well, the end was at the start.
[50:48.430 --> 50:51.510]  So this is the start. I think it starts. It ends where it starts.
