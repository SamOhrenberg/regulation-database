[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  Mom, dad, my body is growing at an alarming rate.
[00:03.460 --> 00:07.240]  And the clothes you buy me now will be very small, very soon.
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.640]  But your wallet doesn't have to suffer because of fashion,
[00:09.780 --> 00:11.800]  with the low prices of Amazon's Back to School.
[00:12.660 --> 00:14.940]  Amazon, spend less, smile more.
[00:25.490 --> 00:26.690]  On your mark, get set, go.
[00:27.130 --> 00:28.830]  Hello and welcome to another episode...
[00:28.830 --> 00:30.150]  What? Andrew!
[00:30.730 --> 00:31.330]  That was loud.
[00:31.870 --> 00:32.930]  That was very loud, Geoff.
[00:33.410 --> 00:36.410]  Andrew, was I too loud? Or did you step on me?
[00:36.410 --> 00:39.730]  I said, ready, set, go. You said, ready, set, go. I was excited.
[00:40.250 --> 00:41.430]  We haven't done this in a while.
[00:41.890 --> 00:44.490]  You gotta think, Geoff, that people might start this podcast
[00:44.970 --> 00:46.470]  as the first thing they did that day.
[00:46.550 --> 00:48.290]  They don't know where they left their volume.
[00:48.790 --> 00:50.750]  They could be sleeping next to...
[00:50.750 --> 00:52.550]  Someone could be in bed next to them asleep,
[00:52.670 --> 00:54.690]  and you've just blasted their eardrums.
[00:54.710 --> 00:57.950]  I will ramp it up in case it's the first thing they do.
[00:58.350 --> 00:58.590]  Okay.
[00:58.710 --> 01:00.110]  Could you come in with less energy?
[01:00.430 --> 01:02.490]  Do you want to do that again? Do you want to repeat it?
[01:02.530 --> 01:04.170]  If you'll shut the fuck up...
[01:04.170 --> 01:06.570]  Come with less and with more.
[01:06.670 --> 01:07.210]  Okay.
[01:07.870 --> 01:08.270]  It's loud.
[01:08.890 --> 01:11.430]  Hello, and welcome to F*** Face.
[01:11.810 --> 01:20.110]  A podcast about friendships and feet and monkeys and baseball cards.
[01:20.770 --> 01:21.370]  My name is Geoff.
[01:21.650 --> 01:22.690]  Accurate. I'm Gavin.
[01:23.130 --> 01:24.010]  I'm Andrew.
[01:24.550 --> 01:24.890]  Yeah, you are.
[01:24.970 --> 01:26.810]  Yeah. Yeah, I am. It's not a question.
[01:28.170 --> 01:29.250]  How's it going, guys?
[01:29.570 --> 01:31.230]  Oh, you know, pretty good. Pretty good.
[01:31.230 --> 01:35.610]  After the Lost podcast, we were talking about Coolio, we were talking about Stevie Wonder.
[01:36.190 --> 01:43.890]  So I started listening to those songs, and I found this amazing clip from the Billboard Awards in 1995,
[01:44.610 --> 01:50.270]  where Stevie Wonder just walks out into the middle of Gangsta's Paradise and starts singing it with them.
[01:50.510 --> 01:51.190]  It was amazing.
[01:51.330 --> 01:51.870]  What's your news?
[01:52.030 --> 01:53.670]  I bet that was a really cool moment, actually.
[01:53.950 --> 01:56.250]  Yeah, they were like trading lyrics back and forth. It was amazing.
[01:56.950 --> 02:00.210]  I'm going to go ahead and guess that was the highlight of Coolio's lifetime.
[02:01.750 --> 02:03.010]  I mean, what a cool one to have.
[02:03.090 --> 02:08.190]  But goddamn, getting to play, getting to sing with Stevie Wonder on stage, probably not something I'm going to do.
[02:08.530 --> 02:12.910]  Yeah, and Stevie Wonder was singing Gangsta's Paradise, but then Coolio and LV are singing Pastime Paradise.
[02:13.110 --> 02:13.370]  It was top.
[02:13.550 --> 02:18.210]  Oh, f***ing, they flip the script.
[02:18.430 --> 02:18.830]  That's pretty cool.
[02:19.190 --> 02:19.310]  Yeah.
[02:19.470 --> 02:21.110]  Stevie Wonder is blind, right?
[02:21.370 --> 02:21.750]  He's blind.
[02:22.330 --> 02:23.070]  I feel pretty confident.
[02:23.150 --> 02:24.950]  It's one of the things people know about him, yeah.
[02:25.050 --> 02:25.370]  Yeah.
[02:25.370 --> 02:28.510]  Although a lot of people say he's actually not blind at all.
[02:28.790 --> 02:29.690]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[02:29.730 --> 02:30.690]  How far was that walk?
[02:31.210 --> 02:33.150]  That's the most impressive leap in itself.
[02:33.850 --> 02:37.150]  Listen, Gavin and I, and Gavin, I'm sure you know where I'm going with this.
[02:37.490 --> 02:40.270]  Gavin and I lived with a blind woman for a year.
[02:40.810 --> 02:49.910]  And blind people are better at seeing, not seeing than anybody with two or three or four eyes on Earth.
[02:50.250 --> 02:52.110]  We have too many senses.
[02:52.610 --> 02:53.510]  We lived with Daredevil.
[02:54.810 --> 02:57.150]  She could see way better than I could.
[02:57.290 --> 02:58.010]  And I can see.
[02:58.410 --> 02:59.430]  Yeah, it was amazing.
[02:59.610 --> 03:03.010]  She could smell like it was unbelievable.
[03:03.130 --> 03:07.310]  She's an unbelievable woman, our friend Patricia, who she's also an Olympian.
[03:07.590 --> 03:08.290]  Yeah, wow.
[03:08.370 --> 03:09.950]  So pretty, pretty impressive lady.
[03:10.130 --> 03:13.790]  But yeah, blind people can see way better than people with with eyes, I think.
[03:14.190 --> 03:14.350]  Yeah.
[03:14.430 --> 03:15.870]  Oh, I know, not using their eyes.
[03:16.370 --> 03:18.630]  Yeah, not not trying to discriminate in any way.
[03:18.670 --> 03:19.810]  It's just I don't know.
[03:19.890 --> 03:20.610]  Sounds like he works.
[03:20.690 --> 03:21.070]  It's impressive.
[03:21.170 --> 03:21.610]  No, I'm not.
[03:21.670 --> 03:22.770]  I'm giving him props.
[03:22.770 --> 03:25.890]  That was an achievement or it wasn't.
[03:26.010 --> 03:27.550]  I don't know how I think it looks.
[03:28.030 --> 03:30.610]  OK, well, you're doing well so far.
[03:31.630 --> 03:34.970]  We were talking earlier, Gavin, before you got here about how,
[03:35.670 --> 03:38.870]  you know, we joke about how this podcast has kind of ruined our friendships
[03:38.870 --> 03:40.770]  because we don't want to talk off camera.
[03:41.190 --> 03:42.170]  Yeah, it's a little waste.
[03:42.370 --> 03:44.990]  It's it's almost making Andrew and I adversarial.
[03:45.330 --> 03:48.570]  We realized we were both talking in the like the lobby before the recording.
[03:49.810 --> 03:52.390]  And I wanted to talk about what I wanted to talk about,
[03:52.390 --> 03:53.390]  but I didn't want him to hear it.
[03:53.430 --> 03:55.350]  And he felt the same way to the point where we were.
[03:55.430 --> 04:00.390]  We were avoiding talking to each other about face in the face lobby.
[04:00.890 --> 04:04.610]  Is that why the second I arrived in the lobby, you were like, roll,
[04:04.770 --> 04:06.310]  roll audio now. Let's go.
[04:07.390 --> 04:08.570]  Because it was getting real awkward.
[04:10.710 --> 04:11.550]  I got some.
[04:11.550 --> 04:12.190]  It was weird.
[04:12.290 --> 04:13.570]  I got some farts sent to me.
[04:13.850 --> 04:15.630]  I did. I sent you some farts yesterday.
[04:16.110 --> 04:17.770]  I'm jealous. I didn't get farts.
[04:17.970 --> 04:18.930]  Why did I get farts?
[04:19.210 --> 04:19.890]  Because I wanted to.
[04:19.950 --> 04:21.330]  I wanted you to hear him for the first time on.
[04:21.330 --> 04:22.970]  I want to get your genuine reaction.
[04:23.350 --> 04:26.570]  What about what about his what his genuine reaction?
[04:26.730 --> 04:28.270]  I respect his reaction less.
[04:28.490 --> 04:31.990]  Dude, I got a fart because I was talking about how my farts are lame
[04:31.990 --> 04:33.470]  and they all kind of sound like questions.
[04:33.950 --> 04:36.130]  Geoff sent me the ultimate question.
[04:36.570 --> 04:37.370]  You know, I'm going to go.
[04:37.470 --> 04:38.630]  I'm going to just go ahead and play you.
[04:38.930 --> 04:42.310]  We've talked about my question fart in previous episodes, I think.
[04:42.650 --> 04:44.410]  And I'll play this one for you right now.
[04:44.470 --> 04:48.650]  This is the the question fart of all question farts, I think.
[04:48.830 --> 04:49.890]  Here we go. Hopefully you can hear.
[04:53.970 --> 04:55.310]  It's ponderous, as if to say.
[04:57.490 --> 04:58.870]  What is the context?
[04:59.150 --> 05:03.410]  It's like you were doing a task that you were enjoying and someone said your name
[05:03.410 --> 05:06.030]  and you're like, hmm, yes, yes.
[05:07.850 --> 05:11.590]  I went back and curated like 60 farts yesterday
[05:11.590 --> 05:13.790]  and deleted a bunch and recorded a bunch.
[05:13.990 --> 05:15.690]  And I'm glad you actually brought it up, Gavin.
[05:15.770 --> 05:17.790]  It's one of the things I wanted to talk about today.
[05:18.670 --> 05:20.030]  And I'll get back to it in a second.
[05:20.830 --> 05:24.730]  I was I was telling or avoiding telling Andrew earlier
[05:24.730 --> 05:28.650]  that I did something this week that I have never done before.
[05:29.510 --> 05:32.570]  I went back and I listened to old episodes of Face.
[05:33.470 --> 05:35.730]  And yeah, I don't really listen to.
[05:35.890 --> 05:37.870]  I'm one of those people that doesn't like to listen to himself
[05:37.870 --> 05:40.070]  because I all I can hear is how dumb I sound.
[05:41.070 --> 05:43.270]  And so you guys were hilarious, by the way.
[05:43.370 --> 05:46.230]  But my performances are C- at best.
[05:46.490 --> 05:49.650]  Anyway, so I went back and I listened to a couple episodes of Face
[05:50.230 --> 05:53.770]  and I took some notes and I realized there's some some loose threads
[05:53.770 --> 05:55.430]  out there and things that I wanted to talk about,
[05:55.570 --> 05:58.010]  not the least of which was the fart thing.
[05:58.390 --> 06:00.850]  And then Andrew mentioned he had a couple of notes as well.
[06:01.330 --> 06:04.250]  So I was going to pull them up and see if you guys didn't mind
[06:04.250 --> 06:05.910]  if we just go through it. Absolutely.
[06:06.270 --> 06:09.370]  It's like a cleaning house, you know, tying up some loose ends.
[06:10.070 --> 06:12.270]  First off, Andrew, how is your foot?
[06:12.630 --> 06:15.290]  Oh, my foot, my foot is better than it was.
[06:15.410 --> 06:17.290]  Still not great. A little bit better, though.
[06:17.290 --> 06:20.030]  What is that like on a scale of one to ten?
[06:20.150 --> 06:23.450]  Ten being normal, one being misery.
[06:23.810 --> 06:25.810]  Misery. OK, we're doing reverse in my head.
[06:25.910 --> 06:27.810]  I was going like one normal ten misery.
[06:28.210 --> 06:29.970]  I'd say it's about a four.
[06:30.590 --> 06:32.190]  That's not great. That's not.
[06:32.390 --> 06:35.850]  That's that's only that's only three up from James Kahn in misery.
[06:37.550 --> 06:38.770]  That's why I started it, too.
[06:39.250 --> 06:40.130]  So I'm up to four.
[06:40.770 --> 06:41.890]  OK, things are looking up.
[06:42.210 --> 06:44.530]  Are you doing physical therapy or anything?
[06:44.770 --> 06:46.970]  No, no, no. I'll figure it out.
[06:47.290 --> 06:47.850]  I'm good.
[06:47.930 --> 06:49.670]  What are you going to figure out?
[06:49.970 --> 06:51.750]  Well, I think I didn't mention this.
[06:52.090 --> 06:53.630]  I don't think you know this, Gavin.
[06:54.150 --> 06:58.150]  I learned like nine months after doing the chicken dinner challenge,
[06:58.150 --> 06:59.770]  which is the PUBG thing I did.
[07:00.110 --> 07:04.070]  Yeah, I had a partially dislocated wrist for like nine months.
[07:04.310 --> 07:05.230]  I had no idea.
[07:05.830 --> 07:07.010]  I didn't realize it.
[07:07.550 --> 07:09.230]  Yeah, it just it really hurt.
[07:09.350 --> 07:12.550]  Like whenever I tried to like put any pressure on that hand,
[07:12.790 --> 07:14.750]  it would really cramp up on my wrist.
[07:14.950 --> 07:16.030]  It was really painful.
[07:16.030 --> 07:19.210]  So instead of going to a doctor, you were just sat there for nine months
[07:19.210 --> 07:20.510]  trying to figure it out?
[07:20.890 --> 07:21.810]  No, well, no, I didn't.
[07:21.950 --> 07:23.270]  I thought, oh, I sprained it.
[07:23.410 --> 07:24.510]  Like this sprain sucks.
[07:24.530 --> 07:26.510]  He was rubbing dirt on it and walking it off.
[07:26.870 --> 07:28.170]  Yeah, I was doing like the old method.
[07:28.250 --> 07:30.070]  I had leeches. I got this figured out.
[07:31.310 --> 07:32.770]  Throw some snakes on it.
[07:33.470 --> 07:34.190]  God damn.
[07:34.530 --> 07:35.510]  No, yeah, it just sucked.
[07:35.750 --> 07:37.930]  And I didn't. I thought, wow, this sprain stinks.
[07:38.090 --> 07:39.310]  I hate having this sprain.
[07:39.430 --> 07:43.370]  And then like nine months passed and it would flare up and I'd notice it at other times.
[07:43.370 --> 07:46.170]  And then I looked, well, how long does a sprain take to heal?
[07:46.590 --> 07:50.210]  And it said like four days, like between two to four days.
[07:51.190 --> 07:53.110]  And I was nine months in.
[07:53.490 --> 07:56.570]  I thought, oh, that's not I don't have a sprain.
[07:56.890 --> 07:58.670]  I don't think this is bad.
[07:59.230 --> 08:02.750]  Oh, so then I just started trying to roll it whenever I could.
[08:03.250 --> 08:07.550]  And one day I rolled it across my knee and the entire forearm
[08:07.550 --> 08:09.930]  like snapped, like everything adjusted.
[08:10.230 --> 08:11.210]  And then it was good.
[08:11.210 --> 08:13.630]  Zero pain. Back to normal.
[08:14.310 --> 08:16.350]  Have you been rolling your foot over things?
[08:16.690 --> 08:17.470]  Trying to get a snap?
[08:17.810 --> 08:19.350]  No, the toe doesn't work that way.
[08:19.670 --> 08:22.490]  I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure I can't heal it that way.
[08:23.030 --> 08:27.790]  So you relocated your wrist on your own without any medical advice?
[08:28.050 --> 08:29.570]  Yeah. Nice. I'm impressed.
[08:29.890 --> 08:30.930]  Oh, I don't know if it's impressive.
[08:31.230 --> 08:33.270]  I wouldn't give me props for that, but it worked.
[08:33.550 --> 08:35.470]  You're a real Canadian mountain man there, Andrew.
[08:35.710 --> 08:39.390]  I couldn't be less. But sure, I'll take it.
[08:40.570 --> 08:43.990]  I might want to consider seeing a doctor just for the hell of it.
[08:44.310 --> 08:46.130]  Maybe if you get bored on a Wednesday or something.
[08:46.410 --> 08:48.250]  You know what I am actually going to do soon, though?
[08:48.630 --> 08:50.970]  What's doctor? Who needs a doctor? I have some good news.
[08:51.090 --> 08:52.130]  I've been meaning to bring this up.
[08:52.190 --> 08:53.250]  Keep slipping my mind.
[08:53.810 --> 08:55.330]  Very good. This is the moment.
[08:55.850 --> 08:57.690]  This is yeah, this is a great moment to do it.
[08:58.470 --> 09:01.590]  They are relaxing the restrictions
[09:02.150 --> 09:05.170]  to entering long term care facilities where I live.
[09:06.010 --> 09:07.110]  That's some good news.
[09:07.110 --> 09:08.330]  You know what that means?
[09:08.570 --> 09:09.450]  I'm going to get your haircut.
[09:09.910 --> 09:11.690]  I can get my haircut soon!
[09:12.630 --> 09:13.870]  We're getting there.
[09:14.350 --> 09:16.970]  Step by step is coming up.
[09:17.210 --> 09:19.850]  That's one of the things I want to talk about today, actually.
[09:20.190 --> 09:21.550]  OK, we'll get to later.
[09:22.050 --> 09:23.870]  I think we might be doing back to back episodes again.
[09:23.970 --> 09:25.670]  So if we don't get to it this episode, we'll get to it the next.
[09:25.750 --> 09:29.090]  But I'm glad you brought up getting your haircut because that plays into something.
[09:29.310 --> 09:34.170]  I just feel like if you accidentally bring the virus in there,
[09:34.170 --> 09:38.070]  that could be the most damaging haircut history has ever seen.
[09:38.230 --> 09:38.710]  It's a good point.
[09:38.810 --> 09:40.930]  You could wipe out an entire care home.
[09:41.310 --> 09:44.370]  I mean, I've been in quarantine for how long have we been doing this?
[09:44.430 --> 09:46.070]  I barely go out. I'm good.
[09:46.330 --> 09:48.670]  Four months. Four months? That long?
[09:49.810 --> 09:50.890]  It feels longer.
[09:51.250 --> 09:53.730]  Although you have to restart your timer
[09:53.730 --> 09:57.910]  based on when you've emerged from the the bathroom after your move, I think.
[09:58.170 --> 09:59.650]  That's true. That's true.
[10:03.710 --> 10:04.550]  Oh, man.
[10:05.110 --> 10:09.310]  Next thing I wanted to talk about a couple episodes ago, we mentioned
[10:10.450 --> 10:13.530]  Andrew won a Microsoft Surface by spinning a wheel,
[10:13.750 --> 10:15.510]  spinning his Microsoft reward points.
[10:15.770 --> 10:18.990]  First off, I wanted to know if if that Surface came in and if so,
[10:19.030 --> 10:20.970]  if you like it or if you dislike it.
[10:21.130 --> 10:22.350]  So, yeah, kind of.
[10:22.910 --> 10:25.610]  This is a very of course, this is how it worked for me.
[10:25.790 --> 10:28.310]  Turns out you don't get the Surface.
[10:28.310 --> 10:32.270]  You get given store credit to the value of the product you want.
[10:32.550 --> 10:34.070]  So you had to then buy the Surface.
[10:34.430 --> 10:35.830]  Well, it's funny you mention that.
[10:36.470 --> 10:37.570]  Yeah, that's what I was like.
[10:37.610 --> 10:39.590]  Wow, this is I'm like a kid in a candy store.
[10:39.610 --> 10:42.110]  I can get whatever I want with this credit. This is exciting.
[10:42.390 --> 10:44.730]  I think I'm going to get the Surface anyway.
[10:45.210 --> 10:47.230]  I kind of the tablet I have is old.
[10:47.410 --> 10:49.210]  I could use a new tablet. This is perfect.
[10:49.510 --> 10:51.750]  And I go to buy it and it's sold out.
[10:52.170 --> 10:54.830]  So I won a sold out prize.
[10:55.390 --> 10:57.010]  Couldn't claim it if I wanted to.
[10:58.430 --> 10:59.730]  So that was my big win.
[10:59.910 --> 11:01.970]  Did you go for something else or are you just going to hold the credit?
[11:02.570 --> 11:04.410]  Oh, I did. And that was a nightmare, too.
[11:04.610 --> 11:08.310]  I I've always wanted an elite controller for the Xbox.
[11:08.490 --> 11:09.430]  I've never had one.
[11:09.690 --> 11:10.470]  That's so good.
[11:10.770 --> 11:11.910]  I've never had one.
[11:12.010 --> 11:14.230]  I've always wanted one. I thought this is it.
[11:14.310 --> 11:15.410]  This is the perfect time.
[11:15.670 --> 11:17.170]  So I ordered one.
[11:17.370 --> 11:20.150]  And funny enough, when we're recording the last time we recorded,
[11:20.270 --> 11:23.610]  I got a phone call from a private number and I thought that's I don't know, whatever.
[11:23.910 --> 11:26.150]  I just threw my phone and then it clicked.
[11:26.150 --> 11:28.050]  That's probably the controller.
[11:28.850 --> 11:31.930]  And so it turned into it was he didn't know where to find my place
[11:31.930 --> 11:33.730]  and it turned into a whole nightmare.
[11:34.190 --> 11:35.530]  The website said one thing.
[11:35.670 --> 11:38.270]  I called to arrange the delivery at another place.
[11:38.470 --> 11:39.710]  It was a disaster.
[11:40.230 --> 11:43.190]  I ended up finding it, but they didn't want to give it to me
[11:43.190 --> 11:46.970]  because I didn't have an ID with my current address on it.
[11:47.290 --> 11:48.430]  So it became a whole negotiation.
[11:48.490 --> 11:51.630]  I ended up walking away with it, but that's close to my prize
[11:51.630 --> 11:53.270]  being a controller I couldn't get.
[11:53.550 --> 11:54.770]  That was almost my big win.
[11:54.770 --> 11:57.270]  It almost ended up in the Australian postal system.
[11:57.410 --> 12:00.270]  So, yes, exactly.
[12:00.510 --> 12:01.490]  So did you get a Series 2?
[12:01.910 --> 12:03.510]  I got a Series 2. Yeah.
[12:03.530 --> 12:04.350]  Oh, it's so good.
[12:04.930 --> 12:05.930]  Is it worth it? Are you happy?
[12:06.170 --> 12:07.310]  Oh, it's it's awesome.
[12:07.410 --> 12:11.550]  I mean, I don't use the paddles at all because I don't need to for how I play.
[12:11.690 --> 12:12.850]  That's the first thing I took off.
[12:12.970 --> 12:16.410]  But I don't know what I do with the paddles because I play with my finger curves.
[12:17.050 --> 12:18.670]  So I use the paddles.
[12:18.710 --> 12:21.530]  If I'm not using the paddles in the game, I've set my volume on the paddles.
[12:21.610 --> 12:23.350]  So I just use them to control my telly.
[12:23.710 --> 12:24.330]  I can do that.
[12:24.330 --> 12:25.370]  Yeah, you can do that.
[12:25.510 --> 12:26.150]  That's good to know.
[12:26.230 --> 12:26.990]  I didn't know that.
[12:27.130 --> 12:27.930]  Yeah, it's very convenient.
[12:28.270 --> 12:30.730]  I take those paddles off immediately like Andrew and throw them in a drawer.
[12:30.870 --> 12:33.050]  But I wouldn't mind changing the volume.
[12:33.450 --> 12:34.630]  Yeah, I taught myself how to use them.
[12:34.650 --> 12:38.770]  I have like I usually have like jump, crouch, scope and sprint on my paddles
[12:38.770 --> 12:39.990]  in the same place for every game.
[12:40.150 --> 12:40.890]  And it works pretty well.
[12:41.150 --> 12:43.210]  That's pretty. You would think you'd be better given that.
[12:43.390 --> 12:45.270]  Oh, no, it doesn't help me play at all.
[12:46.070 --> 12:47.870]  I just have to move my thumbs less.
[12:48.170 --> 12:52.830]  Well, I'm glad to hear that your Surface turned into probably a much more useful,
[12:52.830 --> 12:54.650]  honestly, Elite 2 controller.
[12:55.050 --> 12:59.930]  But that reminded me that at some point Gavin mentioned that he had something
[12:59.930 --> 13:04.730]  like 26,000 Microsoft reward points lifetime or some shit.
[13:05.250 --> 13:08.350]  Yeah. And I got to wondering, I wonder how many I have.
[13:08.450 --> 13:10.470]  So I looked it up about an hour ago.
[13:10.970 --> 13:15.190]  Would either of you care to guess how many lifetime Microsoft reward points I have?
[13:15.270 --> 13:21.670]  So basing it on the fact that we all used your credit card for years and years,
[13:21.670 --> 13:24.970]  I'd be blown away if you had lifetime less than 50,000.
[13:25.130 --> 13:26.950]  Are these prices right rules?
[13:27.090 --> 13:28.130]  Can I go one?
[13:28.390 --> 13:29.090]  Yeah, I don't give a shit.
[13:29.170 --> 13:29.990]  You can do one.
[13:29.990 --> 13:30.730]  You're not competing.
[13:30.970 --> 13:31.470]  I'm doing one.
[13:31.870 --> 13:32.730]  It's always a competition.
[13:33.170 --> 13:34.710]  OK, well, that was stupid.
[13:35.570 --> 13:40.390]  I have apparently, as of one hour ago, three hundred and fifty four thousand
[13:40.390 --> 13:41.730]  two hundred and forty eight
[13:43.390 --> 13:45.590]  Microsoft reward points at my disposable.
[13:46.050 --> 13:47.750]  So fuck you. I'm rich.
[13:47.790 --> 13:49.950]  I'm retiring. I'm cashing out.
[13:51.150 --> 13:52.950]  You got to you got to hit that pinata.
[13:53.190 --> 13:56.130]  You're going to win store credit for the sold out surface
[13:56.130 --> 13:58.470]  and you're going to have to buy other stuff and sell that.
[13:58.590 --> 13:59.470]  And then you'll be rich.
[13:59.550 --> 14:01.730]  I'm going to retire on elite two controllers.
[14:03.190 --> 14:04.510]  That's a lot of points.
[14:04.710 --> 14:05.650]  It's a lot of points.
[14:05.870 --> 14:06.830]  Are you going to thump the pinata?
[14:06.950 --> 14:08.670]  See if you win anything at some point.
[14:08.810 --> 14:09.850]  We killed the pinata.
[14:10.290 --> 14:11.330]  The pinata is dead.
[14:11.870 --> 14:13.590]  I last time I looked, it's not there.
[14:13.670 --> 14:16.390]  I think people started playing that after we talked about it.
[14:16.450 --> 14:17.710]  We beat it to death.
[14:17.710 --> 14:22.310]  It crashed my browser in the in the recording when I was doing it.
[14:22.330 --> 14:24.330]  And I've never been able to load that page again.
[14:25.230 --> 14:27.830]  I'm pretty sure I can use it for hundreds,
[14:28.050 --> 14:30.450]  if not thousands of dollars in gift certificates and stuff.
[14:30.530 --> 14:31.410]  From what I can tell.
[14:31.750 --> 14:32.250]  That's awesome.
[14:32.470 --> 14:34.430]  If there's a pinata or a wheel, I would rather
[14:34.850 --> 14:37.110]  throw caution to the wind and gamble with it.
[14:37.270 --> 14:41.150]  Yeah. Anyway, all you have to do is never spend or look at your Microsoft
[14:41.150 --> 14:44.630]  reward points and let an entire company charge stuff to your personal credit card.
[14:44.750 --> 14:45.510]  And there you go.
[14:45.950 --> 14:49.190]  I think they expire, which makes that even more impressive.
[14:49.290 --> 14:53.050]  Oh, God, don't tell me that my my fortune is dwindling away.
[14:55.590 --> 14:58.690]  Also, one other little thing some people have pointed out,
[14:58.690 --> 15:01.650]  and I wanted to apologize and issue a retraction
[15:01.650 --> 15:04.490]  throughout the course of the last few podcasts.
[15:04.650 --> 15:08.930]  Andrew and Gavin have repeatedly referred to Jane Goodall
[15:09.570 --> 15:12.510]  as Dian Fossey and Dian Fossey as Jane Goodall.
[15:12.590 --> 15:14.490]  And for shame, you guys got it backwards.
[15:14.490 --> 15:16.430]  I should have stopped you. It wasn't me.
[15:16.670 --> 15:17.850]  What are you talking about?
[15:18.030 --> 15:18.990]  I have no idea what you're saying.
[15:19.150 --> 15:20.170]  You referred to
[15:21.850 --> 15:22.570]  Jane Goodall
[15:24.010 --> 15:26.810]  as as gorillas in the mist, but that was actually Dian Fossey.
[15:27.090 --> 15:29.790]  Oh, so you're saying the thing that you said is something that we said.
[15:30.530 --> 15:32.190]  What you said is the thing. Yes.
[15:32.330 --> 15:35.310]  Oh, OK. OK. Well, I'm very sorry about that.
[15:35.690 --> 15:37.750]  It's OK. You're forgiven, I think. OK.
[15:38.270 --> 15:42.030]  Also wanted to I know that there was some there was some confusion recently.
[15:42.030 --> 15:45.610]  And it was maybe yes, maybe no.
[15:45.770 --> 15:47.890]  But I went ahead and I just wanted to clear it up.
[15:47.990 --> 15:53.270]  I went and I looked and I can confirm that Halo 4 is in the Master Chief collection.
[15:54.390 --> 15:58.730]  So now that now that like definitively we know that it is there now.
[15:59.170 --> 16:02.270]  So no more no more cause for for confusion there, guys.
[16:02.730 --> 16:04.490]  I got to the bottom of it. You're welcome.
[16:04.870 --> 16:07.370]  Oh, I also have an update about something else we're talking about
[16:07.370 --> 16:08.970]  that I read in the comments.
[16:08.970 --> 16:14.050]  Thank you, comments for informing me that One Night in Bangkok is indeed about chess
[16:14.050 --> 16:17.010]  because it's from a musical called Chess.
[16:17.230 --> 16:19.590]  I also saw that. That was one of my notes as well.
[16:19.710 --> 16:21.470]  But that's great.
[16:22.170 --> 16:23.670]  Congratulations on that one.
[16:23.770 --> 16:25.310]  You you were wrong there, too.
[16:25.810 --> 16:29.610]  What else? Oh, oh, a lot of people have asked me for an update
[16:29.610 --> 16:31.870]  on my pinky toe nail falling off.
[16:32.030 --> 16:34.030]  Like, is it growing back? What's happening?
[16:34.170 --> 16:35.270]  Is it gross? Does it hurt?
[16:35.630 --> 16:36.890]  I'll be honest with you.
[16:36.890 --> 16:39.330]  I have made a decision in my life.
[16:39.790 --> 16:43.170]  It's a very personal decision to me, but I will share it with you.
[16:43.490 --> 16:46.330]  Not to look. I have no idea how my toe is.
[16:46.430 --> 16:47.990]  I haven't looked at my foot since that day.
[16:48.130 --> 16:49.350]  I'm a little scared, too.
[16:49.590 --> 16:50.630]  I don't feel any pain.
[16:50.810 --> 16:51.730]  Nothing feels out of whack.
[16:51.890 --> 16:55.230]  But I figure I'll just go a year or so without looking at it.
[16:55.490 --> 16:59.630]  And then maybe in 2021, I'll see if I have a pinky toe.
[16:59.630 --> 17:03.610]  I mean, maybe you just haven't had enough emotional support around looking
[17:03.610 --> 17:05.390]  like we're here now. We're here for you.
[17:05.390 --> 17:08.470]  If you want to take a look, just give it a glance.
[17:08.650 --> 17:10.270]  I'm not going to do it. I'm not looking. I can't do it.
[17:10.350 --> 17:13.530]  I appreciate it. Maybe we'll do some sort of a charity drive.
[17:13.630 --> 17:14.770]  Maybe it's a maybe it'd be a stretch goal.
[17:15.830 --> 17:16.790]  Look at my pinky toe.
[17:16.830 --> 17:18.010]  Geoff looks at his own foot.
[17:19.810 --> 17:20.410]  Extra life.
[17:20.790 --> 17:23.390]  Hit this tier in extreme close up, Geoff's foot.
[17:23.670 --> 17:26.290]  Geoff, do you want to talk about a different fart that you sent?
[17:27.050 --> 17:28.610]  Yeah, well, I was going to I'm going to get there.
[17:28.630 --> 17:29.270]  I'm going to get to the farts.
[17:29.270 --> 17:29.950]  I got a little thing in my mouth.
[17:29.970 --> 17:32.910]  Because I can't wait for you to get to a fart that you sent to both of us.
[17:33.050 --> 17:35.050]  OK, both of you, you and Andrew?
[17:35.050 --> 17:36.990]  Yeah. It wasn't the question fart?
[17:37.350 --> 17:39.530]  No, it was the one that you sent Andrew.
[17:39.710 --> 17:40.670]  I assume it was Andrew.
[17:40.770 --> 17:43.610]  I don't have Andrew's phone number, but I just guess that that was probably the one.
[17:43.750 --> 17:45.030]  Is it the one where I shit my pants?
[17:45.750 --> 17:46.470]  Yes. Yes.
[17:46.870 --> 17:49.250]  I didn't I didn't prep that fart.
[17:50.990 --> 17:52.810]  I prepped other farts. I didn't prepped anything.
[17:53.390 --> 17:54.430]  But here's the thing, right?
[17:54.470 --> 17:56.510]  You sent me this far and you sent it to Andrew.
[17:56.650 --> 17:59.970]  But I noticed that because I assume Andrew doesn't have an iPhone,
[18:00.570 --> 18:01.450]  comes in as green.
[18:01.870 --> 18:04.710]  And I think what that does is that compresses the file
[18:05.050 --> 18:07.510]  because it knows it's not going to an iPhone.
[18:07.890 --> 18:12.110]  So it sounds like really old audio from like a phone
[18:12.110 --> 18:15.790]  20 years ago because I think it had to go to Andrew, too.
[18:16.110 --> 18:18.690]  So all of the fidelity of the fart is gone.
[18:18.790 --> 18:22.770]  And I said to you that it sounded like dash cam audio of a car crash.
[18:26.610 --> 18:30.270]  Well, in some ways, it was a car crash in my swim trunks.
[18:30.450 --> 18:33.430]  How did you not prep that? That is very alarming.
[18:33.430 --> 18:36.210]  How many times have you shit yourself since that happened?
[18:36.770 --> 18:38.610]  That was the last time I shit myself.
[18:38.690 --> 18:40.190]  It was not the last close call.
[18:41.130 --> 18:42.130]  Yeah, Andrew, that's a good point.
[18:42.230 --> 18:43.690]  That doesn't even register for Geoff.
[18:43.830 --> 18:45.370]  That was like it happened. It's gone.
[18:46.430 --> 18:47.990]  Well, yeah. All right.
[18:48.150 --> 18:51.350]  I'll try to I was going to say I had a whole thing going where I was going to,
[18:51.450 --> 18:55.990]  you know, a lot of people think that I am a perfect farter, you know,
[18:56.070 --> 18:59.690]  like I know that I'm kind of I've achieved a level of success
[18:59.690 --> 19:02.690]  partially through farting and fart related content.
[19:02.690 --> 19:05.270]  And I think a lot of people think it comes naturally to me
[19:05.270 --> 19:08.470]  and that like all farts are magic or all farts are gold for me
[19:08.470 --> 19:12.570]  and that I'm in some way better that I'm a better farter than you.
[19:12.690 --> 19:15.590]  And while that may be true, I don't want you to think it's just pure talent
[19:15.590 --> 19:16.690]  and that's not something you can achieve.
[19:16.730 --> 19:18.210]  It's kind of a 10,000 hours type thing.
[19:19.730 --> 19:22.730]  But, you know, not all not all farts are created equal.
[19:22.810 --> 19:25.090]  And I thought I would play a couple that are like, here's one
[19:25.510 --> 19:26.430]  from just the other night.
[19:26.590 --> 19:29.330]  It's going to be hard for you to hear, but there's going to be the slightest
[19:29.330 --> 19:34.130]  the slightest sound of like compressed air, like that's the fart.
[19:34.490 --> 19:36.870]  But you can hear my frustration at the end of it, I think,
[19:37.250 --> 19:40.690]  because I woke up at like three in the morning and I held it and held it
[19:40.690 --> 19:43.750]  and held it to find my phone to then put it up to my butt.
[19:43.890 --> 19:44.470]  And then it happened.
[19:44.590 --> 19:47.590]  And so I just want you to get to know, because I realized when we professionals,
[19:47.810 --> 19:51.370]  whether we're comedians or musicians, nobody puts the outtakes right.
[19:51.590 --> 19:53.430]  You don't hear you hear the finished album.
[19:53.730 --> 19:56.870]  You don't hear all the hours in the in the recording studio
[19:56.870 --> 19:58.330]  that you just threw in the fucking trash.
[19:58.330 --> 20:02.630]  So so here's a here's me at three in the morning trying to catch gold
[20:02.630 --> 20:06.970]  because a golden golden anus and falling a little bit short.
[20:07.150 --> 20:08.650]  So here I hope this plays here.
[20:08.670 --> 20:10.770]  Free birds. Oh, wait. Wrong one.
[20:14.010 --> 20:15.910]  That's funny. I didn't have these in order.
[20:16.150 --> 20:18.770]  So you had time to prep.
[20:19.230 --> 20:20.310]  I did. I did. I did.
[20:20.650 --> 20:21.670]  Labeled free birds.
[20:22.390 --> 20:23.510]  It wasn't. It was.
[20:23.670 --> 20:25.850]  Well, anyway, I bet this we're just going to go through the farts
[20:25.850 --> 20:27.370]  and then I'll tell you. All right, here we are.
[20:28.750 --> 20:29.570]  It's a waste.
[20:30.030 --> 20:31.850]  It's not loud enough. I'll have to boost it and get back to you.
[20:32.110 --> 20:35.630]  The free birds one is it's it's where you can start to hear my family
[20:35.630 --> 20:37.430]  getting sick of me. OK.
[20:39.090 --> 20:40.530]  Oh, that's just a good ass for it.
[20:40.590 --> 20:42.290]  I just said that to hold on.
[20:42.590 --> 20:44.590]  How did you not organize these at all?
[20:44.870 --> 20:46.050]  I didn't organize them nearly.
[20:46.170 --> 20:47.590]  Your thoughts are not filed properly.
[20:47.670 --> 20:48.510]  They're just all in a bag.
[20:48.570 --> 20:49.610]  I know. I know. I know.
[20:50.930 --> 20:51.590]  Free birds.
[20:52.570 --> 20:54.850]  Yes, that one. I didn't finish it.
[20:57.010 --> 20:57.730]  You can't hear.
[20:57.730 --> 21:01.010]  I don't know if you'd hear that, but that was Emily and Millie
[21:01.010 --> 21:02.430]  being disgusted by me.
[21:02.490 --> 21:03.330]  I sensed it.
[21:03.470 --> 21:07.350]  I got one of Millie doing homework the other day real fast.
[21:07.550 --> 21:09.850]  Well, see, I hadn't I hadn't had time.
[21:09.970 --> 21:12.290]  I thought Gavin pushed me into the fart conversation.
[21:12.390 --> 21:13.530]  Sorry, I was really excited.
[21:14.150 --> 21:15.750]  No, no, no. I understand.
[21:15.930 --> 21:17.470]  How about biology homework?
[21:21.330 --> 21:23.350]  As we help Emily with her biology homework,
[21:25.410 --> 21:26.730]  it's like a weird poetry.
[21:26.730 --> 21:30.070]  If anyone in your family hears you just describe the moment
[21:30.970 --> 21:32.370]  they know a fart is coming.
[21:32.530 --> 21:34.230]  Oh, I think this might be me shitting myself.
[21:34.310 --> 21:35.230]  SUV fart.
[21:36.810 --> 21:38.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was it.
[21:38.930 --> 21:40.450]  That's the one. Here, I'll play it again.
[21:40.550 --> 21:41.070]  I'll play it again. It's perfect.
[21:41.170 --> 21:41.590]  Just get real quiet.
[21:41.930 --> 21:43.050]  SUV fart.
[21:44.610 --> 21:47.250]  Yeah, it really sounds like someone getting rear-ended.
[21:47.750 --> 21:52.810]  Yeah, that's well, it was it was it was my shorts getting rear-ended by me.
[21:53.510 --> 21:55.550]  Yeah, that was a that was a wet one.
[21:55.550 --> 21:56.910]  It was a messy duty.
[21:57.510 --> 21:59.630]  I had to immediately wash those shorts.
[22:00.470 --> 22:02.010]  So so you just you were in an SUV?
[22:02.290 --> 22:03.250]  You were in the car when that happened?
[22:03.630 --> 22:07.910]  Yeah, I started labeling my farts for you because you suggested it.
[22:08.010 --> 22:10.890]  And so now I try to put a little head and tail on all my farts.
[22:11.290 --> 22:14.450]  And and then yeah, and then I like try to give some context
[22:14.450 --> 22:15.410]  to what's going on in the world.
[22:15.470 --> 22:18.630]  Like we were eating free birds for dinner when I did the free birds fart.
[22:18.970 --> 22:20.830]  You put a little too much tail on that last one.
[22:21.070 --> 22:24.630]  Oh man, that was it was way too much tail.
[22:24.630 --> 22:28.510]  Yeah, but on the bright side, it disgusted my girlfriend
[22:28.510 --> 22:32.450]  who had to look at me run through our front yard,
[22:32.630 --> 22:35.710]  cupping my butthole in my hand and going, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[22:35.790 --> 22:36.370]  I'll clean it up.
[22:36.810 --> 22:39.390]  So have you just completely let yourself go in front of her now?
[22:39.950 --> 22:40.870]  Not on purpose.
[22:43.190 --> 22:44.370]  I wasn't perfect.
[22:44.750 --> 22:46.050]  Yes, but I wasn't.
[22:46.170 --> 22:47.550]  It wasn't what I was gunning for.
[22:47.930 --> 22:49.470]  It just kind of happened on that one.
[22:49.650 --> 22:54.070]  So you clearly stopped recording before you realized you'd shat yourself
[22:54.070 --> 22:56.150]  or maybe you stopped out of embarrassment.
[22:56.350 --> 23:00.830]  But I feel like you should always leave a little bit more tail room.
[23:01.430 --> 23:06.110]  No pun intended to just sort of take in and realize what has happened,
[23:06.270 --> 23:06.650]  if anything.
[23:07.090 --> 23:08.810]  I was so shocked and horrified.
[23:08.950 --> 23:09.810]  I panic stopped.
[23:10.170 --> 23:13.390]  But yeah, going forward, I'm going to try to be more present
[23:13.390 --> 23:17.310]  in the moment when I'm recording, and I'll try to make sure that I don't
[23:17.310 --> 23:20.070]  I don't cut off early again, because, yeah, that was a that was really
[23:20.070 --> 23:23.890]  that was a real letdown that we I mean, I'm happy that I caught myself.
[23:24.070 --> 23:26.690]  How smug I felt at the beginning of the recording.
[23:26.810 --> 23:28.910]  And then I caught myself literally shitting my pants.
[23:29.010 --> 23:32.310]  But then you get none of my shame, of which there was much.
[23:32.870 --> 23:34.410]  So, um, yeah.
[23:35.450 --> 23:39.150]  Then another thing I've been I think that's all my old notes from the past.
[23:39.330 --> 23:39.990]  Oh, no, it isn't.
[23:40.050 --> 23:41.710]  Andrew, did you ever draw your ups?
[23:41.810 --> 23:42.770]  You're looking up face?
[23:43.230 --> 23:45.830]  No, I completely forgot I was supposed to do that.
[23:45.950 --> 23:46.950]  I forgot that was the thing.
[23:47.290 --> 23:48.590]  Yeah, I want to see your face.
[23:48.970 --> 23:50.830]  I'll prepare because I still can't picture it.
[23:50.930 --> 23:52.730]  I still don't know what that means.
[23:52.730 --> 23:54.010]  Yeah, I don't.
[23:54.190 --> 23:55.170]  I think you're right.
[23:55.190 --> 23:56.870]  I don't think it makes sense visually.
[23:57.350 --> 23:58.910]  But is this something that we can commission?
[23:59.270 --> 24:00.850]  Uh, you know, I think I could do it.
[24:00.870 --> 24:01.630]  I just I don't.
[24:01.710 --> 24:03.450]  Once again, I don't have a paper.
[24:03.650 --> 24:04.750]  Well, I don't have a pen.
[24:04.810 --> 24:05.390]  What kind of person?
[24:05.670 --> 24:08.130]  Like, I get that you might not have paper on you,
[24:08.170 --> 24:12.070]  but what kind of person can't get access to paper within the next hour?
[24:12.450 --> 24:13.510]  Like walk to a printer?
[24:13.830 --> 24:15.470]  We're in a we're doing a podcast.
[24:15.690 --> 24:15.950]  What do you mean?
[24:15.950 --> 24:17.230]  I can't take this with me.
[24:17.590 --> 24:18.870]  Can't throw this in a backpack.
[24:19.590 --> 24:20.530]  What do you want me to do?
[24:21.110 --> 24:23.190]  Well, just before the next podcast, see if you can do it.
[24:23.210 --> 24:24.050]  I forgot. I will.
[24:24.170 --> 24:24.910]  I promise I will.
[24:24.990 --> 24:26.030]  I forgot it was a thing.
[24:26.450 --> 24:30.230]  Do this. Spray the fire extinguisher on the floor and then draw it
[24:30.230 --> 24:31.230]  in the fire extinguisher.
[24:31.810 --> 24:33.010]  Yeah, that'll work great.
[24:33.370 --> 24:35.670]  And maybe Geoff and I were playing a duel with our notes.
[24:35.790 --> 24:39.730]  I could have done it before we recorded, but we're in a fucking duel.
[24:40.250 --> 24:41.210]  It's very intense.
[24:54.200 --> 24:57.000]  We're back together with the release of Grateful Dead Juicy Pale Ale,
[24:57.260 --> 25:00.720]  a light bodied pale ale brewed with sustainable kerns of grains, granola

[26:00.500 --> 26:03.480]  This episode is brought to you by Manscaped.
[26:03.760 --> 26:06.940]  Summer's in full swing, and we're thankful for our sponsor today,
[26:07.020 --> 26:08.560]  Manscaped, for keeping us fresh.
[26:09.020 --> 26:10.500]  You know, the sun's out, the buns out.
[26:10.660 --> 26:15.460]  But hopefully, if you are any kind of a respectable human being,
[26:15.700 --> 26:17.240]  your pubes are not out.
[26:17.460 --> 26:18.840]  Nobody wants to see them.
[26:19.160 --> 26:20.420]  This isn't 1972.
[26:20.980 --> 26:21.800]  It's 2020.
[26:22.440 --> 26:25.880]  Thankfully, Manscaped offers all the right tools to keep your hair groomed
[26:25.880 --> 26:27.200]  above and below the belt.
[26:27.380 --> 26:29.300]  You know, that's something that I've never understood.
[26:29.580 --> 26:33.460]  You go to like a restaurant or back when I was drinking a bar
[26:33.460 --> 26:37.920]  and you see a dude in the mirror, like fixing his hair for 20 minutes,
[26:38.360 --> 26:39.940]  getting it perfectly quaffed.
[26:39.960 --> 26:43.260]  And he's got that that perfect like five o'clock shadow
[26:43.260 --> 26:45.220]  and a really hard groom line.
[26:45.260 --> 26:47.600]  And you realize the guy spends like two hours a day
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.620]  in front of the mirror working on his face.
[26:49.620 --> 26:52.860]  But his junk looks like an ogre.
[26:53.340 --> 26:57.780]  Like, why would you spend so much time trying to look like a supermodel upstairs?
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.260]  But downstairs, you're essentially a troll under a bridge.
[27:01.780 --> 27:04.380]  And somebody is going to see that at some point.
[27:04.600 --> 27:08.100]  Like all the work you put into the upside is so that somebody will see the down
[27:08.100 --> 27:08.740]  downstairs.
[27:09.060 --> 27:12.560]  And if the downstairs looks like a train wreck, what was the point?
[27:12.940 --> 27:13.400]  Come on.
[27:13.660 --> 27:16.800]  They actually just released their Shears 2.0 nail kit,
[27:16.800 --> 27:19.720]  which is the perfect add on to their Lawnmower 3.0.
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.320]  You put those together, that is 5.0 of convenience or the perfect package,
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.060]  as they say.
[27:25.420 --> 27:30.200]  The Shears 2.0 is a luxury four piece nail kit featuring tempered stainless
[27:30.200 --> 27:30.960]  steel tools.
[27:31.200 --> 27:32.620]  I don't know what tempered steel is,
[27:32.860 --> 27:37.120]  but I know that it has a lot to do with knights and the honor and stuff.
[27:37.180 --> 27:37.960]  So it's a big deal.
[27:38.240 --> 27:43.460]  It includes slash tip tweezers, rounded point scissors, fingernail clippers
[27:43.460 --> 27:45.820]  and a medium grit nail file.
[27:45.820 --> 27:51.080]  The perfect package 3.0 kit comes with the essential Lawnmower 3.0 water
[27:51.080 --> 27:51.460]  resistant,
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.520]  cordless body trimmer and a ton of other liquid formulations to round out your
[27:55.520 --> 27:56.520]  manscaping routine.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.700]  I imagine it's a figurative ton,
[27:58.880 --> 28:02.700]  not a literal ton that would be very expensive to mail.
[28:02.960 --> 28:05.680]  And I think we learned on this very podcast that the heaviest thing you can
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.780]  mail through the U S postal system is 70 pounds inside the perfect package.
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.800]  You'll also find the manscaped crop preserver and anti chafing ball deodorant
[28:14.800 --> 28:15.720]  and moisturizer,
[28:16.020 --> 28:19.380]  because we know how painful chafing can be when you're wearing your bathing suit
[28:19.380 --> 28:23.480]  all day. Much as I do. Also, ball deodorant's a good thing.
[28:23.600 --> 28:25.780]  You may not realize it. You're used to your ball smell.
[28:26.040 --> 28:28.700]  Other people are not, and it is pungent.
[28:29.180 --> 28:31.360]  It's like 110 degrees outside in Texas right now.

[28:45.280 --> 28:46.600]  F A C E.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.720]  There are no other words or four letter words that you should be entering in
[28:50.720 --> 28:54.420]  there associated with the title of this show. It's just the face part.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.940]  Summer's here. It's time to manscape.
[28:57.360 --> 29:00.040]  This episode is brought to you by Raycon.
[29:00.400 --> 29:03.840]  Whether you're working from home or working on your fitness, a la Fergie,
[29:03.980 --> 29:08.100]  I assume you want what you're listening to to be what you're listening to.
[29:08.160 --> 29:10.480]  Not what your roommates or parents are listening to.
[29:10.820 --> 29:14.120]  Everyone needs a pair of wireless earbuds. It's like a,
[29:14.120 --> 29:18.340]  it's one of those things you need a food and water and a roof over your head and
[29:18.340 --> 29:20.540]  then a great wireless pair of earbuds.
[29:21.100 --> 29:23.440]  But before you go dropping hundreds of dollars on a pair,
[29:23.720 --> 29:26.020]  why don't you go check out the wireless earbuds from Raycon?
[29:26.340 --> 29:30.300]  You already know Raycon earbuds start at about half the price of any other
[29:30.300 --> 29:33.720]  premium wireless earbuds on the market. And that was easy to say.
[29:34.080 --> 29:37.420]  And that they sound just as amazing as the top audio brands. You know,
[29:37.640 --> 29:38.520]  their newest model,
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.680]  the everyday E250 earbuds are the best ones yet with six hours of
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.960]  playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing,
[29:46.340 --> 29:51.140]  more base and a more compact design that gives you a nice noise isolating fit.
[29:51.500 --> 29:55.060]  And I just spit all over my laptop when I was reading that. That's this,
[29:55.280 --> 29:58.780]  what is wrong with me? Raycon's wireless earbuds are so comfortable,
[29:59.260 --> 30:01.860]  perfect for conference calls or even binging podcasts.
[30:02.040 --> 30:04.180]  Maybe like the one you're listening to right now,
[30:04.200 --> 30:07.980]  or maybe just listening to music. People still do that, right?
[30:08.320 --> 30:11.940]  I like the battery life. I don't know if you've used other wireless earbuds,
[30:11.940 --> 30:14.760]  but I have, and the battery life is always lacking.
[30:15.180 --> 30:16.440]  Not the case with the Raycon though.
[30:16.720 --> 30:21.100]  I appreciate the extra effort y'all went into boosting that battery.
[30:21.600 --> 30:23.200]  Unlike some of your other wireless options,
[30:23.520 --> 30:28.320]  Raycon earbuds are both stylish and discreet with no dangling wires or stems
[30:28.320 --> 30:31.240]  to distract anyone during video calls. Boy,
[30:31.320 --> 30:34.680]  if dangling wires or stems aren't distracting, I don't know what are.
[30:35.120 --> 30:38.500]  You've heard me talk about how the company was founded by Ray J and celebrities
[30:38.500 --> 30:41.620]  like Snoop Dogg and JR Smith are obsessed with Raycons.
[30:41.620 --> 30:44.940]  Shout out to JR Smith. Just got picked up by the Lakers, by the way.
[30:45.540 --> 30:46.580]  Speaking of getting picked up,
[30:46.740 --> 30:50.180]  why don't you pick up a pair of Raycons and see what all the hype is about.
[30:50.580 --> 30:52.720]  Now's the time to get the latest and greatest from Raycon.
[30:53.100 --> 30:57.660]  Get 15% off your order at buyraycon.com slash face.
[30:57.840 --> 31:03.400]  That's buyraycon.com slash face for 15% off Raycon wireless earbuds.
[31:04.020 --> 31:11.600]  That's B-U-Y-R-A-Y-C-O-N dot C-O-M slash F-A-C-E-R.
[31:11.620 --> 31:13.360]  F-A-C-E. Do it.
[31:15.180 --> 31:17.060]  That's pretty much it for my notes, Andrew.
[31:17.140 --> 31:19.620]  So I would like to cede the rest of the podcast to yours.
[31:19.800 --> 31:23.760]  OK, well, mine is just sort of like a what's been happening
[31:23.760 --> 31:27.040]  because we haven't talked since July 3rd, right?
[31:27.380 --> 31:28.700]  Right before July 4th.
[31:29.220 --> 31:30.960]  I think I accidentally made $100.
[31:31.940 --> 31:33.760]  I'm not positive I did.
[31:33.980 --> 31:37.420]  I feel like I feel like it would be illegal what I did.
[31:37.480 --> 31:38.360]  It feels like a scam.
[31:38.360 --> 31:42.240]  Feels like too good of a scam to be something that actually happened.
[31:42.420 --> 31:44.940]  But I think I made $100 on a refund.
[31:45.640 --> 31:47.040]  I think it's possible.
[31:47.920 --> 31:52.060]  I preordered something months ago, like a few months ago,
[31:52.440 --> 31:54.180]  and then I canceled my preorder.
[31:54.880 --> 31:57.740]  And I think it was a product in a different country.
[31:57.980 --> 31:59.520]  So it had an exchange rate on it.
[31:59.860 --> 32:05.340]  And I think the economy has shifted to where on my refund, I got $100 back.
[32:05.960 --> 32:07.860]  Like $100 more than what I put in.
[32:07.860 --> 32:08.980]  I don't think that's illegal.
[32:09.440 --> 32:12.680]  I've just seen like I'd never I think I profited on a refund.
[32:12.760 --> 32:13.900]  And it was totally accidental.
[32:14.300 --> 32:17.260]  That must have been an expensive item if it fluctuated by $100.
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.680]  It was pretty expensive.
[32:18.920 --> 32:20.660]  It's it's called currency manipulation.
[32:20.720 --> 32:22.640]  And you are going to federal prison.
[32:22.900 --> 32:23.420]  Oh, great.
[32:24.020 --> 32:25.420]  Can we can we edit this?
[32:25.920 --> 32:27.300]  We can edit this, right?
[32:27.440 --> 32:28.900]  No, this is live. This is live to tape.
[32:29.140 --> 32:30.840]  And oh, OK. Yeah, yeah.
[32:30.900 --> 32:32.580]  It's it goes on Geoff's tape.
[32:32.940 --> 32:34.120]  Yeah, it goes live to my tape.
[32:34.180 --> 32:36.120]  And then I release it to the FBI.
[32:36.600 --> 32:38.280]  Uh, no, it's not illegal.
[32:38.540 --> 32:41.740]  You're it's I think that there are rules around that if you're doing it as a practice.
[32:41.740 --> 32:43.420]  But I think you just got lucky.
[32:43.740 --> 32:45.240]  Oh, legally lucky.
[32:45.500 --> 32:46.200]  Yeah, that's great.
[32:46.380 --> 32:47.340]  Congratulations. Yeah, I'm up.
[32:47.740 --> 32:48.760]  That was good.
[32:49.080 --> 32:50.520]  It's a good thing that's that's happened.
[32:50.880 --> 32:52.340]  What are you going to spend $100 on?
[32:52.640 --> 32:54.180]  Oh, surface.
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.460]  Oh, I could.
[32:57.040 --> 32:58.520]  I could with the credit I have left.
[32:58.540 --> 32:59.520]  I can get a surface.
[32:59.940 --> 33:01.140]  I like where your head's at, Gavin.
[33:01.460 --> 33:02.200]  This is a great idea.
[33:02.580 --> 33:04.560]  I could draw the face on the surface.
[33:04.560 --> 33:05.740]  Right. You can draw on tablets.
[33:05.740 --> 33:07.200]  That's that's what I was hoping.
[33:07.440 --> 33:08.060]  Yeah. Wow.
[33:08.360 --> 33:09.240]  I won't need paper.
[33:09.380 --> 33:10.500]  This is genius.
[33:11.300 --> 33:15.380]  And if with any money left over, you can use the surface to buy hamburgers,
[33:15.420 --> 33:17.040]  which is its intended purpose anyway.
[33:17.300 --> 33:17.880]  That's true.
[33:18.140 --> 33:19.500]  That is that is the main goal.
[33:19.620 --> 33:21.120]  I wonder how many burgers you could buy.
[33:21.200 --> 33:22.720]  How many points did you say you had?
[33:22.920 --> 33:24.840]  Three hundred and twenty five thousand or so, I think.
[33:25.040 --> 33:27.080]  Three hundred and twenty five thousand or so.
[33:27.100 --> 33:27.800]  I'll look into that.
[33:28.180 --> 33:29.780]  But we're talking about that.
[33:30.540 --> 33:32.040]  Well, I'm looking into that.
[33:32.560 --> 33:36.080]  So I was sitting at my desk since the last time we spoke.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.700]  And there's some stuff happening out my window.
[33:40.060 --> 33:42.100]  There are a bunch of cops, a bunch of people.
[33:42.200 --> 33:43.860]  Something had happened outside.
[33:44.540 --> 33:46.220]  And so I kind of walked away for a minute.
[33:46.260 --> 33:50.880]  I was watching from my window and I saw these people, a lot of cops,
[33:50.940 --> 33:51.360]  a lot of people.
[33:51.460 --> 33:55.800]  And I noticed this woman with two bags and she like kind of walked past the cop.
[33:55.860 --> 33:56.720]  And I thought, that's interesting.
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.320]  This seems something might be happening here.
[33:58.400 --> 33:59.480]  What's in those bags?
[33:59.920 --> 34:01.220]  It was like a mini investigation.
[34:01.220 --> 34:02.520]  I was like, where where's she going?
[34:02.560 --> 34:03.160]  What's she going to do?
[34:03.520 --> 34:05.960]  So I was watching her and she walked past the cop.
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.060]  Then she started walking down a little bit and she went up this little hill.
[34:10.200 --> 34:13.480]  And I could see to the back of a business and they have like a grass parking lot.
[34:13.680 --> 34:14.920]  Like, that's also weird.
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.480]  This is what she is.
[34:16.600 --> 34:19.480]  She planning the bags, like what's in the bags, what's going to happen?
[34:20.080 --> 34:21.520]  And she keeps walking a little bit more.
[34:21.940 --> 34:25.260]  And then all of a sudden she takes her pants down and goes into a deep squat.
[34:25.320 --> 34:27.140]  And I'm now watching this this homeless woman pee.
[34:27.600 --> 34:28.440]  That was my day.
[34:28.580 --> 34:30.620]  God, that was I was shocking.
[34:30.620 --> 34:32.260]  It went from like, is this a mystery?
[34:32.360 --> 34:33.520]  What's going to happen? What's going to happen?
[34:33.640 --> 34:35.680]  Oh, God, that woman's peeing. That woman's peeing.
[34:36.040 --> 34:37.160]  I didn't want to see this.
[34:37.380 --> 34:38.400]  What was your reaction?
[34:39.020 --> 34:40.000]  That was my reaction.
[34:40.380 --> 34:42.200]  Oh, God, I didn't want to see this.
[34:42.220 --> 34:43.320]  It was a side profile.
[34:43.560 --> 34:46.560]  I couldn't see anything, but I could see the act.
[34:47.020 --> 34:47.860]  It was not good.
[34:48.480 --> 34:49.420]  I did not anticipate.
[34:49.840 --> 34:52.680]  This is perfect for something for me.
[34:52.760 --> 34:54.140]  I love this. This is great.
[34:54.280 --> 34:56.620]  You love a homeless peeing story?
[34:56.620 --> 34:57.800]  No, no, no, no.
[34:57.800 --> 35:00.680]  It goes right into the peeing perv.
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.560]  OK, yeah, no, that's great.
[35:02.780 --> 35:04.840]  I this was not premeditated.
[35:05.320 --> 35:07.600]  I this was not a good event in my life.
[35:07.940 --> 35:10.640]  But there's a payoff to this, which is OK.
[35:11.280 --> 35:13.760]  So I watched the pee and that was terrible.
[35:13.960 --> 35:16.920]  And so then an hour later, like an ambulance shows up.
[35:16.960 --> 35:18.080]  I'm like, well, what's going on now?
[35:18.400 --> 35:19.860]  And so I'm looking at the ambulance.
[35:20.100 --> 35:22.940]  And then I noticed the back of the business door open
[35:22.940 --> 35:24.780]  that the person peed in the lineup.
[35:25.340 --> 35:28.080]  And I'm just watching this person with a garbage bag over their head
[35:28.080 --> 35:29.600]  and they're walking down the steps.
[35:29.820 --> 35:31.900]  And I'm just watching saying she's going to walk and pee.
[35:32.300 --> 35:33.580]  That woman's going to walk through pee.
[35:34.020 --> 35:35.940]  And she absolutely walked through pee.
[35:36.160 --> 35:37.160]  I felt so bad.
[35:37.360 --> 35:40.740]  It was like watching a horror movie and I'd be able to yell at the characters.
[35:41.060 --> 35:43.000]  There's nothing I could do to communicate.
[35:43.460 --> 35:44.720]  Don't step through that.
[35:45.080 --> 35:46.120]  She totally did yell.
[35:46.820 --> 35:48.280]  Well, I well, yeah.
[35:48.420 --> 35:49.300]  Well, that'd be weird.
[35:49.400 --> 35:50.960]  Why am I going to just yell from my balcony?
[35:51.640 --> 35:52.180]  The pee!
[35:52.180 --> 35:57.820]  Well, what would you have yelled if you'd have if you'd have had slightly more warning?
[35:58.580 --> 36:00.200]  I think I just would have yelled pee.
[36:00.460 --> 36:02.680]  I would have yelled, hey, pee, pee.
[36:04.680 --> 36:06.200]  I wouldn't have helped anyone.
[36:06.400 --> 36:07.580]  How could I have?
[36:07.760 --> 36:09.320]  You're not describing anything.
[36:09.480 --> 36:10.680]  You just sound like a madman.
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.220]  Yeah, but sometimes when you describe people that know there's a lot of people
[36:14.220 --> 36:14.900]  they're going to look at me.
[36:14.980 --> 36:16.160]  You think like, I don't know.
[36:16.240 --> 36:17.340]  I don't think I could have helped.
[36:17.460 --> 36:18.640]  I had like a five second window.
[36:18.800 --> 36:20.120]  I feel like you could have yelled,
[36:20.680 --> 36:23.260]  that is a massive puddle of piss.
[36:23.800 --> 36:25.800]  Well, I didn't I also didn't know if they'd walk through it.
[36:25.860 --> 36:27.880]  There's a possibility they wouldn't.
[36:28.220 --> 36:30.400]  You don't want to think like you overreacted.
[36:30.660 --> 36:35.680]  Yeah, and then also to Geoff's point, I seem super fucking weird.
[36:35.920 --> 36:36.920]  Am I the pee guy?
[36:37.120 --> 36:38.040]  Like now I'm the pee guy.
[36:38.340 --> 36:40.780]  Like this was a coincidence that I'm not the pee guy.
[36:41.120 --> 36:42.400]  It happened once. It was a coincidence.
[36:42.500 --> 36:43.380]  No, I'm not. Yeah.
[36:43.600 --> 36:44.500]  I witnessed it.
[36:44.980 --> 36:46.440]  That was terrible. I felt bad.
[36:46.940 --> 36:48.520]  She probably still doesn't know she walked through pee.
[36:50.140 --> 36:53.460]  He well, maybe she listens to fuckface and she's about to find out
[36:53.460 --> 36:56.480]  and she's going to say like, oh, those were brand new shoes.
[36:56.640 --> 36:58.680]  I saved up months and months and months for them.
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.440]  They were like limited edition, like Nike SBs.
[37:03.540 --> 37:04.720]  Like, I don't know.
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.000]  And and and they're one of only 300 made.
[37:08.060 --> 37:10.760]  And and I just trudged through homeless piss.
[37:11.040 --> 37:14.620]  And if only if only Andrew had stopped me, he could have saved me.
[37:14.720 --> 37:17.320]  The indignity of wallowing in urine.
[37:18.120 --> 37:18.900]  What would you have said?
[37:18.900 --> 37:23.380]  Stop. Well, she's going to know there's nobody stops.
[37:23.540 --> 37:25.200]  If you're yelling at a crowd of people to stop.
[37:25.440 --> 37:26.880]  I don't think most people stop.
[37:26.960 --> 37:28.360]  I think maybe a few do.
[37:28.440 --> 37:32.000]  I think you get lucky that I'm I'll be honest with you.
[37:32.120 --> 37:35.580]  I don't know what I would do in the moment, but I don't think the moment
[37:35.580 --> 37:38.720]  would happen because I wouldn't be a peeping Andrew from the beginning.
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.220]  You don't if there's an ambulance outside your window.
[37:42.340 --> 37:43.760]  You do not peek at the ambulance.
[37:44.100 --> 37:45.160]  You weren't looking at the ambulance.
[37:45.240 --> 37:47.380]  You were looking at a homeless lady peeing in the back.
[37:47.380 --> 37:48.660]  I didn't know.
[37:48.920 --> 37:51.860]  First of all, it's the back of a business, not a back alley.
[37:52.140 --> 37:53.820]  This is a very public area.
[37:54.180 --> 37:56.520]  Second of all, I didn't. That's not what I wanted.
[37:56.700 --> 37:58.620]  I thought I was getting a mystery, Geoff.
[37:58.960 --> 38:00.460]  I thought this is going to be a good mystery.
[38:00.480 --> 38:02.100]  You got a mystery and you solved it.
[38:02.420 --> 38:04.440]  The mystery of is Andrew a peeping Tom?
[38:04.780 --> 38:06.820]  Yes. No, no, no.
[38:06.940 --> 38:09.420]  If I if you'd have known that.
[38:09.620 --> 38:12.920]  OK, so if you knew that I was about to watch you walk through piss
[38:12.920 --> 38:15.740]  and I didn't say anything and you just walked through all the piss,
[38:15.740 --> 38:16.960]  would you be annoyed at me?
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.760]  Well, if we if I said what the like, if what's the context is just you and I.
[38:22.140 --> 38:23.060]  Is it the same scenario?
[38:23.520 --> 38:24.240]  What is the context?
[38:24.420 --> 38:26.200]  Yes, I'm you in your situation.
[38:26.380 --> 38:27.840]  You're OK. No, I'm you.
[38:28.020 --> 38:32.500]  You're her. No, you're you're the person who was walking through the piss.
[38:32.660 --> 38:34.080]  And I call you two hours later.
[38:34.080 --> 38:35.660]  I'm like, Andrew, you walked through a piss today.
[38:36.480 --> 38:38.460]  And you're like, I'm like, I watched you do it.
[38:38.500 --> 38:39.520]  And you're like, why didn't you warn me?
[38:39.540 --> 38:40.640]  I'll be like, I don't know what to say.
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.300]  Yeah, I never tell the person if I knew the personally, I would never tell them.
[38:44.300 --> 38:48.060]  Right. But if I if I did know you, would you be annoyed that I didn't scream out?
[38:48.160 --> 38:49.420]  Watch out for the piss puddle.
[38:49.940 --> 38:51.560]  I would have said, why didn't you warn me?
[38:51.580 --> 38:55.660]  And then you would have been like me and said, I could like, what am I supposed to say?
[38:55.680 --> 38:56.840]  And then I would have said, good point.
[38:56.900 --> 39:00.200]  There's nothing. That's just a chaos is in motion.
[39:00.300 --> 39:02.140]  You can't stop it. There's too much momentum.
[39:02.420 --> 39:04.860]  Here's how it would how it would really go, Gavin.
[39:05.580 --> 39:07.880]  Hey, Gavin, earlier today, you remember we were hanging out?
[39:08.020 --> 39:09.880]  Yeah. And I waved at you and you came over.
[39:10.240 --> 39:12.380]  You walked through a puddle of a homeless lady's piss.
[39:12.380 --> 39:16.740]  Oh, did you wave me over so I would walk through the piss?
[39:17.080 --> 39:19.040]  One hundred percent. I steered you toward the urine.
[39:19.320 --> 39:20.340]  I don't like you anymore.
[39:20.600 --> 39:22.980]  I know. OK, goodbye.
[39:23.320 --> 39:23.840]  Fair enough.
[39:28.100 --> 39:32.100]  This did. You know, I didn't expect to get slandered by Geoff, which I should have.
[39:32.260 --> 39:33.520]  That's foolish on my part.
[39:33.780 --> 39:34.320]  It's slander.
[39:34.500 --> 39:36.900]  But this this reminds me of something.
[39:37.620 --> 39:38.560]  Watch this, Gavin.
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.200]  I thought giving me time is dangerous.
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.260]  And I had time. OK, we last recorded this.
[39:43.260 --> 39:46.340]  Geoff, say something slanderous about me.
[39:46.600 --> 39:47.600]  Call me out once again.
[39:48.200 --> 39:49.980]  Andrew, I think face face face.
[39:50.800 --> 39:56.520]  So I just I just fucking weaponized our show name again.
[39:57.340 --> 39:58.460]  That's genius.
[39:58.960 --> 40:00.960]  Whenever we need to.
[40:01.440 --> 40:04.000]  But weaponized the show name.
[40:04.500 --> 40:05.760]  Why haven't we been doing this?
[40:06.180 --> 40:10.740]  If you extended the first word in our show name for like 10 seconds,
[40:10.740 --> 40:12.600]  would it be a 10 second bleep?
[40:12.600 --> 40:13.740]  I don't think so.
[40:13.860 --> 40:14.980]  Well, I don't think so.
[40:15.040 --> 40:15.740]  No, I don't know.
[40:16.240 --> 40:17.560]  That was a creative decision.
[40:17.700 --> 40:18.140]  I don't know.
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.440]  I think if it's followed by face, it would have to be.
[40:25.070 --> 40:26.790]  Face. Yeah, that's bleep.
[40:26.890 --> 40:29.370]  That's that's I think you probably I think this hold on.
[40:33.380 --> 40:34.380]  You're my face.
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.900]  Yeah, I don't think my mic cut out.
[40:37.460 --> 40:38.500]  I didn't hear anything.
[40:38.600 --> 40:39.960]  I just I got bleeped already.
[40:40.460 --> 40:41.280]  I got bleeped before I got.
[40:41.380 --> 40:42.000]  God damn it.
[40:44.020 --> 40:45.500]  That was a live one.
[40:45.500 --> 40:47.100]  That's a dumb name for this show.
[40:47.220 --> 40:48.340]  It was a dumb name.
[40:48.700 --> 40:49.720]  Eric is typing.
[40:49.960 --> 40:50.780]  This is terrible.
[40:51.340 --> 40:52.980]  Huh? What does that mean?
[40:53.340 --> 40:55.220]  Like a terrible audio experience.
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.720]  Oh, he's like, this isn't a good show.
[40:58.960 --> 41:02.680]  Oh, it's an indictment on our ability to entertain.
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.360]  I would assume that's rude.
[41:04.940 --> 41:05.400]  It didn't work.
[41:05.520 --> 41:06.640]  I tried to face him.
[41:06.800 --> 41:07.460]  It didn't work.
[41:07.600 --> 41:09.040]  Still, you'd still just see.
[41:09.180 --> 41:13.100]  Also, have you noticed like as much as we try and pretend
[41:13.100 --> 41:17.280]  that all of the listeners to this podcast aren't already aware of us on Rooster Teeth.
[41:17.720 --> 41:21.220]  Have you noticed that if you type F*** Face on our own website,
[41:21.800 --> 41:23.240]  this podcast doesn't come up.
[41:24.260 --> 41:26.420]  You actually have to type the asterisks.
[41:27.000 --> 41:27.560]  That's mental.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.460]  I think it's for all of them, right?
[41:30.060 --> 41:31.120]  I don't think it's just this site.
[41:31.420 --> 41:34.520]  It's a real shame because it's a it's a good one.
[41:34.620 --> 41:36.100]  But you really got to put the work in.
[41:36.320 --> 41:39.700]  If you if you listen to F*** Face, you deserve it because you
[41:40.720 --> 41:42.580]  put some effort into getting there.
[41:42.580 --> 41:43.200]  Yeah.
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.000]  Congratulations.
[41:44.120 --> 41:46.780]  Your reward is you get to listen to a really funny dude
[41:46.780 --> 41:49.060]  and a British guy and a piss fetish kid.
[41:49.740 --> 41:51.160]  F*** F***. God damn it.
[41:51.440 --> 41:54.680]  I just got two f***s off.
[41:55.680 --> 41:56.120]  Shit.
[41:57.440 --> 41:59.120]  I got to be quick on the time now.
[42:01.220 --> 42:02.740]  You're very proud of yourself.
[42:03.120 --> 42:04.640]  That was great. It went really well.
[42:05.080 --> 42:07.980]  Oh, that reminds me of speaking of proud
[42:08.440 --> 42:09.980]  and F*** Face as a podcast
[42:09.980 --> 42:12.680]  and directions to go in and stuff.
[42:12.840 --> 42:15.120]  As you know, I wanted to I wanted to approach the subject of you guys.
[42:15.420 --> 42:17.820]  As you know, maybe this will be the last thing we talk about before we end up
[42:17.820 --> 42:20.800]  because we get we should probably wrap up soon and and then stop and record
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.220]  another one, which, by the way, get ready, Andrew.
[42:24.340 --> 42:27.840]  Your pee thing is definitely involved in the next episode.
[42:27.940 --> 42:28.480]  I don't like it.
[42:28.520 --> 42:29.160]  I can already see where it's going.
[42:29.380 --> 42:30.140]  I don't know. OK.
[42:30.760 --> 42:33.420]  So I listen to a lot of other radio and podcasts.
[42:33.820 --> 42:37.280]  If you know me and you two do, but if you're listening, you might not know me.
[42:37.300 --> 42:37.720]  Why would you?
[42:37.780 --> 42:38.480]  We've probably never met.
[42:38.980 --> 42:42.220]  But I have listened to the Howard Stern show in my entire life
[42:42.220 --> 42:45.980]  since 1995 or so, and I listen to a lot of other podcasts
[42:45.980 --> 42:48.960]  because this is basically all I've ever tried to do
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.420]  is be a shitty version of Howard Stern meets Joan Rivers my entire life.
[42:53.140 --> 42:55.560]  But the other day on the Howard Stern show,
[42:56.080 --> 43:00.200]  I noticed a thing that they did where Sal, a person who's on the show,
[43:00.280 --> 43:03.020]  saw the stockbroker, just a normal dude, a little weird,
[43:03.340 --> 43:05.440]  but he he's got a long foreskin.
[43:05.440 --> 43:08.920]  His foreskin is like they say, like three inches long as it hangs.
[43:09.260 --> 43:14.200]  And he was able to pull his foreskin up and around and stick it
[43:14.200 --> 43:15.200]  in his own butthole.
[43:15.440 --> 43:18.480]  So he was able to like push his foreskin, not his penis,
[43:18.520 --> 43:20.140]  because he's a normal dude. He doesn't have a giant cock.
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.440]  But he was able to push his foreskin because it's so pliable into his butthole
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.820]  so that his butt was eating his his foreskin, essentially.
[43:29.160 --> 43:30.020]  Like a rubberus.
[43:30.300 --> 43:33.740]  Yes. Kind of like that picture you drew of your brother.
[43:34.980 --> 43:37.680]  Then I was listening to Your Mom's House podcast,
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.960]  which is the Tom Segura, Christina Pruszynski podcast.
[43:40.340 --> 43:41.360]  They're famous comedians.
[43:41.960 --> 43:45.440]  And on their show, they had a dude on who they had found on Twitter
[43:45.440 --> 43:46.360]  or TikTok or something.
[43:46.640 --> 43:48.020]  And I apologize, I don't remember the guy's name,
[43:48.480 --> 43:50.340]  but I think he's maybe a gay porn star.
[43:50.700 --> 43:54.240]  But he's also kind of like a from what I understood from the podcast,
[43:54.260 --> 43:57.100]  he's also kind of like a Johnny Knoxville jackass kind of guy.
[43:57.400 --> 44:00.740]  Like they were describing, he does a lot of like sex related stunts
[44:00.740 --> 44:02.000]  and then puts them up on social media.
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.240]  Like he they were saying that he stuck a dildo on the front of a skateboard
[44:06.240 --> 44:09.320]  and then like they had somebody ride the skateboard up a ramp
[44:09.320 --> 44:11.520]  and into his butthole, you know, like that kind of stuff.
[44:12.500 --> 44:15.640]  Well, that guy, that guy was able to
[44:16.500 --> 44:18.240]  take his balls are so big.
[44:18.420 --> 44:23.840]  He was able to take his balls and shove both balls in his asshole.
[44:24.700 --> 44:27.020]  And then well, then I think he proceeded to masturbate
[44:27.020 --> 44:28.240]  because it was like a porno or something.
[44:28.540 --> 44:30.780]  But he was able to fit his balls in his butt.
[44:30.780 --> 44:34.880]  And Sal on The Howard Stern Show was able to put his foreskin in his butt.
[44:35.220 --> 44:39.020]  And I like to stay abreast of popular trends.
[44:39.900 --> 44:43.060]  And that's obviously I mean, both of those happen within two weeks of each other.
[44:43.420 --> 44:46.040]  You can make the claim that one was maybe copying off the other
[44:46.040 --> 44:48.260]  or just great ideas happen all the time.
[44:48.500 --> 44:53.660]  But I'm taking it as a sign that one of you two needs to put something of you in you.
[44:54.160 --> 44:58.620]  I don't think I've ever been so horrified when the introduction to that was
[44:58.620 --> 45:01.060]  your story is going to fit perfectly with this,
[45:01.520 --> 45:04.280]  not knowing what the expectation was going to be at the end.
[45:04.380 --> 45:05.420]  That was horrifying.
[45:05.800 --> 45:08.680]  Yeah. I mean, firstly, there go the sponsors for this one again.
[45:09.020 --> 45:14.240]  And secondly, how do you pee through a three inch foreskin?
[45:14.560 --> 45:16.720]  You can be circumcised and still have one.
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.940]  Yeah, he apparently it's messy and he constantly has to clean out
[45:21.940 --> 45:25.140]  the inside of his foreskin with paper, with like toilet paper.
[45:25.220 --> 45:26.980]  And apparently toilet paper gets stuck in there.
[45:26.980 --> 45:29.880]  And I'm just really I mean, but you don't have it.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.820]  I know you're not circumcised, but I don't think you have a three inch foreskin.
[45:33.320 --> 45:35.480]  I don't think you got a big, you know, a big udder dangling
[45:35.480 --> 45:37.060]  from the top of your dick like he does.
[45:37.200 --> 45:38.360]  Yeah, not even close.
[45:38.500 --> 45:40.300]  It's like it's like a deflated balloon.
[45:40.580 --> 45:42.760]  It's like an oversized turtleneck.
[45:43.280 --> 45:44.040]  Yeah. Yeah.
[45:44.180 --> 45:46.240]  It's like it's like Steve Jobs's
[45:47.120 --> 45:48.720]  turtleneck on Steve Jobs now.
[45:51.640 --> 45:52.280]  Oh, what?
[45:53.060 --> 45:58.900]  So do you think that guy could fit his giant balls up the foreskin of the other guy?
[45:59.380 --> 46:02.060]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's they made a big thing.
[46:02.260 --> 46:05.200]  I mean, to my knowledge, these shows don't know each other exists,
[46:05.240 --> 46:06.040]  let alone the people.
[46:06.660 --> 46:10.760]  But I mean, I know that one time they they've done a lot of stunts on Stern
[46:10.760 --> 46:13.000]  where they'll put stuff in Sal's dick.
[46:13.180 --> 46:18.700]  And I know one time I want to say he put like 25 M&Ms in his foreskin at once.
[46:19.820 --> 46:23.500]  Oh, so I would assume he could fit another man's testicle in there.
[46:23.500 --> 46:24.220]  That's the worst.
[46:24.220 --> 46:26.640]  Like, guess how many are in the jar game ever?
[46:33.180 --> 46:35.300]  That's the funniest thing you've ever said.
[46:38.880 --> 46:40.780]  Goddamn, you're funny for a sex criminal.
[46:43.200 --> 46:45.040]  Oh, I'm going to get you one day.
[46:45.080 --> 46:46.900]  I'm going to count one of those one day.
[46:47.200 --> 46:48.440]  This is an embarrassing.
[46:48.560 --> 46:49.640]  It's like we're having a duel
[46:49.640 --> 46:51.700]  and I'm getting my shot off after I'm dead.
[46:51.880 --> 46:55.620]  I am so slow on the draw.
[46:56.020 --> 46:58.220]  Like you shot a bird in the air as you're falling.
[46:58.620 --> 46:59.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[47:00.080 --> 47:01.320]  That's what I took out with me.
[47:01.860 --> 47:04.540]  Anyway, long story, perfectly timed and told.
[47:05.100 --> 47:08.620]  I I don't expect either of you to come up with something off the top of your head.
[47:08.860 --> 47:10.220]  Why are we involved in this?
[47:10.280 --> 47:11.360]  Well, it's great.
[47:11.460 --> 47:13.240]  It's a great question and it's a great point.
[47:13.300 --> 47:14.680]  And I have a great answer for you.
[47:14.980 --> 47:19.380]  On the Howard Stern show, Howard Stern doesn't put the foreskin in his butt.
[47:19.380 --> 47:23.820]  Sal does. Another member of the show on the Tom Segura, Your Mom's House podcast.
[47:24.180 --> 47:26.360]  Tom Segura doesn't put his balls in his own anus.
[47:26.700 --> 47:29.600]  Somebody who's there from the show to entertain does.
[47:29.760 --> 47:33.640]  So it wouldn't make sense for me to put anything in me.
[47:33.780 --> 47:36.260]  Yeah, because I'm the Tom Segura or Howard Stern of this.
[47:36.360 --> 47:37.460]  It's got to be one of you guys.
[47:37.700 --> 47:40.020]  We're like the Robin or the Fred, though.
[47:40.520 --> 47:43.160]  We're not like we're not the Sal's of this podcast.
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.980]  Well, you know, I well, I mean, I would say that maybe that's up for interpretation.
[47:49.700 --> 47:52.420]  And listen, Gav, I'm not asking you to do it right now.
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.720]  I'm just I'm just saying I want you to think about it and we'll come back to table.
[47:57.060 --> 47:58.900]  I mean, you're a person. Two things.
[47:58.960 --> 48:02.060]  First off, now you get now I'm getting you get me riled up because, A,
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.260]  I know that you would let me shit in your pants or in your lap
[48:05.260 --> 48:08.160]  because we've talked about that extensively to the point where we got so gross
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.220]  with that we had to cut most of the conversation out of this podcast
[48:11.220 --> 48:15.460]  because we all agreed that we were on the wrong side of gross over funny.
[48:15.780 --> 48:19.240]  I would say the whole balls and foreskin is on the wrong side as well.
[48:19.240 --> 48:22.460]  Oh, no, that's up here on two different, very popular podcasts.
[48:22.660 --> 48:24.580]  OK, radio shows way more popular than us.
[48:24.880 --> 48:27.760]  And the other thing is you were going to let me.
[48:27.960 --> 48:31.260]  You wanted to stick Mentos in your asshole and then a funnel
[48:31.260 --> 48:35.240]  and then fill it with coke and then watch Mentos and coke explode out of your butthole.
[48:35.540 --> 48:39.520]  And I had to stop you because I saw a video where it looked like a guy's asshole died.
[48:41.060 --> 48:44.380]  And I'm pretty sure, though, once again, that was you saying
[48:44.380 --> 48:47.180]  you should put Mentos in your asshole.
[48:47.400 --> 48:48.960]  And I was like, I mean, you know, OK.
[48:49.240 --> 48:50.620]  You were all about it.
[48:50.660 --> 48:51.720]  You were like, get the Mentos.
[48:52.040 --> 48:53.020]  I don't think I can fit.
[48:53.100 --> 48:54.360]  And I had to back us off.
[48:54.440 --> 48:55.440]  I had to back us off.
[48:55.600 --> 48:57.040]  Also, I know you're up for it.
[48:57.400 --> 49:00.940]  If what we're going on is like, you know, the sows of the show doing these things.
[49:01.340 --> 49:03.020]  That's not Andrew or myself.
[49:03.200 --> 49:03.820]  That's Eric.
[49:04.180 --> 49:05.400]  I'm OK. That's fair.
[49:05.520 --> 49:06.360]  That's fair, Eric.
[49:06.580 --> 49:09.940]  If Eric can fit something of Eric's in Eric, I would accept that.
[49:10.300 --> 49:11.260]  Eric, how do you feel about it?
[49:11.500 --> 49:12.500]  No, thank you.
[49:13.020 --> 49:14.340]  I'll take that as a maybe.
[49:14.960 --> 49:16.600]  Anyway, this is just a jumping off point.
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.000]  We'll discuss it as we go forward.
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.800]  I'm sure Eric heard the Your Mom's House episode and the Stern episode,
[49:21.940 --> 49:22.380]  for that matter.
[49:22.800 --> 49:23.420]  Eric, weigh in.
[49:23.480 --> 49:24.020]  What do you think?
[49:24.040 --> 49:26.620]  Is this the future of radio and podcasting?
[49:26.680 --> 49:28.280]  Who? No, I hope not.
[49:28.600 --> 49:29.040]  F***face.
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.060]  He said yes.
[49:32.740 --> 49:33.380]  He said yes.
[49:33.460 --> 49:35.000]  Just anyone who's curious, he said yes.
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.800]  Andrew, you've got to get faster.
[49:36.980 --> 49:37.780]  You've got to be ready.
[49:38.100 --> 49:42.740]  I think Eric's in a grumpy mood because I just mentioned his like two favorite
[49:42.740 --> 49:44.360]  things in the world, except for wrestling.
[49:44.900 --> 49:47.820]  And he is like, oh, you just told me
[49:47.820 --> 49:52.220]  to put something of myself inside myself and you want me to be thrilled.
[49:52.720 --> 49:54.280]  I told you to consider it.
[49:55.140 --> 49:55.960]  OK, no.
[49:58.260 --> 50:00.380]  I'm hearing I'm hearing maybe from you.
[50:00.480 --> 50:01.040]  That's fine.
[50:01.320 --> 50:02.700]  We're not looking for a commitment today.
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.120]  I'm just thinking if we all want this podcast to succeed,
[50:05.420 --> 50:08.260]  I think we follow in the footsteps of legends.
[50:08.500 --> 50:09.640]  I want it to succeed.
[50:09.760 --> 50:12.240]  I don't think I have the natural talent to do that, Geoff.
[50:12.780 --> 50:16.100]  Even if I was on board, I don't I could train for years.
[50:16.140 --> 50:17.440]  I don't think I could ever pull that off.
[50:17.960 --> 50:20.160]  Well, I don't think there's anything I could do on that level.
[50:20.460 --> 50:21.660]  We'll have to get creative.
[50:22.100 --> 50:24.180]  Like I said, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[50:24.680 --> 50:28.740]  I'm sure that it took Sal and that dude a while to figure out
[50:28.740 --> 50:32.700]  the mechanics, let alone to have the idea, you know, to have the inspiration,
[50:32.860 --> 50:36.140]  that light bulb moment, and then figure out will the light bulb fit in my ass
[50:36.140 --> 50:37.000]  or is that dangerous?
[50:37.280 --> 50:38.580]  Let's find something else.
[50:38.960 --> 50:40.620]  It wasn't built with foreskin either.
[50:40.980 --> 50:44.260]  I have a serious question, but this is getting ridiculous.
[50:44.760 --> 50:45.740]  I have a serious question about this.
[50:45.740 --> 50:51.420]  If Sal farted with his foreskin up his ass, would it inflate and get stuck?
[50:56.500 --> 50:59.460]  I, yeah, I would assume so.
[50:59.780 --> 51:03.500]  Could you inflate your foreskin like a balloon?
[51:05.200 --> 51:07.940]  We're doing back to back, so I can't do an update on this one.
[51:08.040 --> 51:09.160]  I'll find a doctor.
[51:09.360 --> 51:10.660]  I'll talk to a doctor about this.
[51:10.860 --> 51:11.840]  I'll get some info.
[51:12.100 --> 51:13.320]  I'll see if we can figure this out.
[51:13.320 --> 51:14.280]  That's a great question.
[51:14.740 --> 51:18.180]  Ask the Jane Goodall Institute, right?
[51:18.340 --> 51:19.600]  You've got a line in there.
[51:20.160 --> 51:20.880]  They've got doctors.
[51:21.180 --> 51:25.140]  Really, just quickly, I'd like to point out that Geoff has positioned himself
[51:25.140 --> 51:28.820]  like the Howard Stern or Tom Segura of this podcast.
[51:29.280 --> 51:33.700]  The majority of this episode is Geoff playing his own farts.
[51:36.080 --> 51:38.200]  Something I don't think Stern would do now.
[51:38.560 --> 51:43.020]  So something to consider, I guess, on who's the Sal and Richard
[51:43.020 --> 51:43.800]  of this podcast.
[51:45.640 --> 51:46.960]  All right. Touché.
[51:47.140 --> 51:48.560]  I have no defense of that.
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.200]  Well, at least they were well organized.
[51:50.780 --> 51:55.880]  I'll, you know, I'd say, listen, I realize that it doesn't matter.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.560]  Even though I'm 45 and much older than you two, I have to do
[51:59.560 --> 52:01.960]  a lot of the heavy lifting and a lot of the heavy farting.
[52:02.180 --> 52:05.600]  Do you think you'll find farts funny in your 60s and 70s?
[52:05.780 --> 52:07.420]  I hope so, man. I hope so, too.
[52:07.600 --> 52:08.740]  I think so.
[52:08.880 --> 52:10.420]  There's no way at this point.
[52:10.880 --> 52:11.740]  Absolutely, you will.
[52:11.740 --> 52:12.860]  It's never going away.
[52:13.320 --> 52:14.020]  I don't think it will.
[52:14.100 --> 52:18.720]  I mean, you know, yeah, because I'm still into the exact same shit
[52:18.720 --> 52:19.900]  I was into when I was 15.
[52:19.940 --> 52:22.580]  I listened to the same bands, sing the same songs.
[52:22.880 --> 52:25.420]  I ride my bicycle and I play video games like
[52:26.200 --> 52:28.340]  and I read comic books sometimes like what else?
[52:29.220 --> 52:30.540]  Like, why would farting change?
[52:30.740 --> 52:35.680]  You you turn me on to a new song, Geoff, that I've listened to maybe 10 times
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.480]  called We Are The Meat Men and You Suck.
[52:42.640 --> 52:43.780]  What's that song about?
[52:44.760 --> 52:45.780]  I think it's a musical.
[52:46.460 --> 52:48.440]  That's a statement song for the band.
[52:48.560 --> 52:49.180]  That's their name.
[52:49.280 --> 52:51.900]  That is an old punk rock band from the early 80s.
[52:52.040 --> 52:55.880]  And they were incredibly I feel like I should preface this.
[52:55.880 --> 52:58.780]  If you look up the Meat Men and you listen to any of their songs,
[52:58.900 --> 53:00.320]  they are incredibly offensive.
[53:00.620 --> 53:03.060]  Oh, yes. Incredibly offensive.
[53:03.260 --> 53:07.140]  Like one of their most famous songs is One Down Three To Go.
[53:07.340 --> 53:10.080]  And it's just about how we got rid of we got rid of John Lennon.
[53:10.140 --> 53:11.340]  Now we need to kill the rest of the Beatles.
[53:11.880 --> 53:14.940]  And there's there's like probably some really, really
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.560]  offensive stuff in their catalog.
[53:17.880 --> 53:21.320]  I just you just I don't even know where it came from.
[53:21.400 --> 53:22.660]  You mentioned you did like one of those.
[53:22.980 --> 53:26.220]  Yeah, Trevor posted like you have to combine
[53:26.220 --> 53:30.120]  the day of the day you were born with the date of birth or something.
[53:30.620 --> 53:31.700]  And you get two funny words.
[53:31.760 --> 53:34.380]  And mine came out as Meat Men was the name of my band.
[53:34.780 --> 53:36.520]  Oh, right. Yeah, it was just taken.
[53:36.740 --> 53:40.900]  I saw them play live once at Emo's in 95, I want to say.
[53:40.900 --> 53:44.460]  It was a good show, but that is a band that the world has changed
[53:45.420 --> 53:46.840]  has moved on past that band.
[53:46.900 --> 53:47.820]  I'll just say that now.
[53:50.480 --> 53:52.500]  Hey, should we should we stop so we can start again?
[53:52.820 --> 53:54.280]  Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[53:54.600 --> 53:57.340]  All right. Well, Gavin, I think you would ask to do the outro this week.
[53:57.360 --> 53:58.040]  So go for it.
[53:58.720 --> 54:01.160]  Oh, dude, thanks for watching F*** Face.
[54:01.280 --> 54:02.540]  Andrew, final thoughts?
[54:02.920 --> 54:04.840]  Don't have any. Keep up with it, Gavin.
[54:05.500 --> 54:06.420]  Take us to the end.
[54:06.520 --> 54:07.580]  I realized I said watching.
[54:08.400 --> 54:09.740]  Did I say watching or listening?
[54:09.740 --> 54:11.180]  I wasn't really listening.
[54:11.360 --> 54:12.300]  You said watching.
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.360]  He wasn't listening.
[54:13.740 --> 54:14.560]  Back to you, Andrew.
[54:14.980 --> 54:16.300]  Not back to me. Back to you.
[54:16.380 --> 54:17.780]  I don't I don't want to close this week.
[54:17.780 --> 54:19.660]  Over to Geoff. F*** Face.
[54:20.620 --> 54:22.040]  Well, you got to say it with a subscribe.
[54:22.040 --> 54:24.400]  Oh, right. And thanks for watching.
[54:24.840 --> 54:26.080]  No, no, we didn't do that.
[54:26.340 --> 54:28.960]  Thank you for listening to F*** Face.
[54:29.400 --> 54:31.440]  You can technically watch it on the site.
[54:31.560 --> 54:32.880]  It comes up as a video on the site.
[54:32.900 --> 54:33.940]  So that's not incorrect.
[54:33.960 --> 54:35.260]  Yeah, you can't search for it.
[54:35.620 --> 54:39.100]  You can watch a black screen or a rooster teeth logo or a F*** Face logo or whatever.
[54:39.760 --> 54:41.140]  I mean, I assume you have eyes.
[54:41.220 --> 54:44.520]  Even if you're listening to F*** Face, you're watching something with those eyes
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.780]  unless your eyes are closed and then you're just listening to the dulcet
[54:47.780 --> 54:51.500]  sounds of our dreamy voices in your head as they reverberate around.
[54:52.160 --> 54:53.180]  That's cool, too.
[54:53.860 --> 54:57.720]  As long as you have a good time doing it and maybe like and subscribe.
[54:57.880 --> 54:58.700]  Tell some friends.
[54:59.360 --> 55:00.360]  I got to be honest with you.
[55:00.440 --> 55:04.520]  It's a challenge to name a podcast F*** Face and have it exist and continue to exist.
[55:04.740 --> 55:07.360]  So we got over the first hump in that they let us make it.
[55:07.420 --> 55:08.980]  But now we have to keep making it.
[55:08.980 --> 55:13.700]  And that has a lot to do with you and your desire to listen to each episode
[55:14.260 --> 55:15.760]  seven to eight thousand times.
[55:16.500 --> 55:17.820]  Thank you. Love you.
[55:18.420 --> 55:19.360]  Like you very much.
[55:20.020 --> 55:20.320]  You're OK.
