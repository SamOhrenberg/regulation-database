[00:00.000 --> 00:04.980]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico. Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[00:05.440 --> 00:10.460]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[00:10.560 --> 00:15.380]  but they found something unexpected instead. It was still crisp, lively, and smooth,
[00:15.640 --> 00:18.540]  but it had nothing to do with waves. It was Pacifico,
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.600]  a delicious Mexican lager. It's like it was brewed to be discovered.

[00:41.990 --> 00:45.870]  I don't... I don't think I... I'm in... You're gonna have to start it off, Geoff.
[00:46.190 --> 00:50.990]  I think you just did, and thank you for that thrilling and gripping and highly professional
[00:50.990 --> 00:58.450]  intro, Andrew Panton. My name is Geoff Ramsey, and absent today from our podcast is Gavin Frey,
[00:58.770 --> 01:03.370]  who said something about drowning his sorrows in liquor early, early in the day, which I think
[01:03.370 --> 01:07.610]  is pitiful and sad. But that's kind of Gavin, and part of what I want to talk about today
[01:07.610 --> 01:13.310]  is kind of how pitiful and sad he is. This is F*** Face, and you're listening to it.
[01:13.470 --> 01:14.430]  Is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is F*** Face.
[01:14.690 --> 01:18.270]  Are we really doing the intro? Is this the actual intro to the show that we're doing right now?
[01:18.370 --> 01:21.530]  I think it was, yeah. Okay, we're doing the intro. How long do
[01:21.530 --> 01:25.230]  you think Gavin will be on for? I'll be honest. I left my headphones on
[01:25.230 --> 01:29.990]  while I went to the kitchen. I heard everything. I so contemplated just never coming back
[01:29.990 --> 01:34.430]  because he started without me. Glad I didn't say anything bad.
[01:34.430 --> 01:37.650]  You hear that, Gavin? I didn't say a single negative thing.
[01:37.930 --> 01:42.210]  I was there just pouring some water, getting called an alcoholic. Everyone's having a whale of a time.
[01:42.670 --> 01:46.610]  Gavin, let me ask you a question before we get into it. There's a reason why I'm calling you
[01:46.610 --> 01:50.830]  a sad and pathetic human being. Do you know what it is?
[01:51.130 --> 01:55.470]  Well, I would assume it's because I'm an incredibly sad and pathetic human being.
[01:56.070 --> 01:59.310]  Check sound. Who rides a bicycle like my great grandma.
[01:59.630 --> 02:03.950]  Look, we went on a bike ride. Not all of us have fancy bikes where you don't even have to pedal
[02:03.950 --> 02:07.530]  because the bike does all the work for you. You absolutely have to pedal.
[02:07.770 --> 02:11.490]  And I haven't ridden a bike in so long, I forgot which sides the brakes were on.
[02:11.710 --> 02:14.510]  So when I tried to do a cool skid, I almost flew over the handlebars.
[02:15.350 --> 02:20.910]  But let's put that aside. By the way, your intro of this podcast, pathetic, by the way,
[02:21.150 --> 02:27.110]  because you didn't introduce it as piss boy and grill master. I'm just saying that was the promise
[02:27.110 --> 02:31.710]  from last week that has not come to fruition. Here's the problem with doing two episodes
[02:31.710 --> 02:36.670]  back to back and then taking a week off is I have no fucking memory of what we did last time.
[02:36.950 --> 02:38.910]  That was like, that might as well have been in 2018.
[02:39.470 --> 02:42.190]  Why did you bring up piss boy, Gavin? He forgot about it.
[02:42.470 --> 02:44.990]  Why did you bring it up? I was in the clear.
[02:45.190 --> 02:48.050]  I did. I forgot about piss boy.
[02:48.210 --> 02:51.630]  Dude, I originally predicted he would forget in six episodes. It took him
[02:51.630 --> 02:53.630]  one? One or two?
[02:53.890 --> 02:56.050]  We're definitely taking another two week break after this.
[02:56.130 --> 03:00.270]  Adder, I'm sorry about that. Thank God Gavin is always there to remind me.
[03:00.270 --> 03:03.250]  Next time you get water, you won't believe the negative shit I'm gonna say.
[03:04.570 --> 03:06.390]  I'm ready. The truce is over.
[03:06.690 --> 03:11.150]  You guys know when you have, uh, when you have that, that just that like one day a week or a
[03:11.150 --> 03:16.130]  month when it's the day they give you all the fucking spam calls, they just decide to like
[03:16.130 --> 03:20.350]  overload you on one particular day? Wait, you answer your phone when it rings?
[03:20.530 --> 03:24.190]  You answer to strangers? No, but it doesn't stop them from calling.
[03:24.450 --> 03:29.310]  Oh. And sometimes I do have to answer my phone because I'm a busy businessman and I don't
[03:29.310 --> 03:34.170]  always recognize a number and it might be related to my daughter or like, you never know.
[03:34.470 --> 03:35.850]  That's fair. I have been
[03:35.850 --> 03:41.790]  fucked and I can't, I don't have any specific moments that I can think of, but I promise you
[03:41.790 --> 03:47.190]  I have been fucked on multiple occasions in the year 2020 by not picking up the phone because
[03:47.190 --> 03:51.150]  I assumed it was a spam call and then it wasn't and then it was a nightmare.
[03:51.350 --> 03:55.090]  Has it caused you to lose any money or has it just been sort of massive inconveniences?
[03:55.450 --> 03:58.970]  No, it's caused me to like fuck up appointments and stuff. There we go. They're calling right now.
[03:58.970 --> 04:05.110]  So I was gonna say since about 10 a.m. this morning, I've received 17 fucking spam calls
[04:05.110 --> 04:09.810]  and I thought while we're recording, let's count how many we just had our first.
[04:10.110 --> 04:13.410]  Oh. That's number 18. So during the recording, we've had one.
[04:13.590 --> 04:15.350]  Is this a bad time to say I sold your number?
[04:15.730 --> 04:22.430]  If you did, it was a fucking brilliant move and I kind of hope you did because I have revenge planned.
[04:22.670 --> 04:25.330]  Oh. I definitely didn't, didn't do that.
[04:25.970 --> 04:28.950]  I don't like revenge. Revenge is never a fun word.
[04:28.950 --> 04:31.290]  I like that he's planning revenge on a maybe.
[04:31.590 --> 04:36.530]  I inadvertently came upon a revenge about three weeks ago in a conversation with somebody else
[04:36.530 --> 04:41.930]  and I'm holding on to it for just the right dickhead to slight me so that I can unleash
[04:41.930 --> 04:50.090]  upon them an annoying revenge with the annoying fury of a thousand suns, as Dennis Reynolds would say.
[04:50.210 --> 04:54.370]  So you've got like a right back atcha ready to go, but nothing's come atcha.
[04:54.370 --> 05:00.270]  Yeah. It's like you throw 10, uh, spam calls a day at me and I drop a nuclear bomb on your mom's.
[05:02.070 --> 05:03.230]  It's a little extreme.
[05:03.430 --> 05:04.110]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:04.170 --> 05:07.170]  I feel like those are two different leagues of annoyance.
[05:07.850 --> 05:09.630]  Well, you know, you gotta make a statement.
[05:09.930 --> 05:13.090]  I think I'm in the clear. I don't think you're going to fuck with Krampus.
[05:13.410 --> 05:17.610]  Nobody fucks with Krampus. I can do whatever I want to.
[05:17.690 --> 05:21.990]  Oh, it's happened, Geoff. He's embracing it now. He's taking the, he's taking the moniker.
[05:21.990 --> 05:27.730]  Can I say that I inadvertently have totally become the boogeyman?
[05:27.870 --> 05:33.810]  It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen, but it is a reality. I feel bad about it.
[05:33.890 --> 05:37.190]  You recognize the factual nature of my discovery, right?
[05:37.750 --> 05:43.130]  Well, recognize is not, I don't know if that's the right word. I did a thing and I didn't think
[05:43.130 --> 05:49.230]  about the ripple effects of that thing. And I'm a hundred percent the boogeyman, totally by accident.
[05:49.230 --> 05:52.030]  I was well-intended. I meant well.
[05:52.110 --> 05:55.750]  Did you find yourself under a child's bed and you were like, holy shit, this is me.
[05:56.550 --> 05:59.850]  I don't want to hear this conversation. Legally, I'm not. I have nothing to do with YouTube.
[06:00.710 --> 06:05.390]  It's not that type. It's not that bad. Listen, it was a, I think it's a good idea.
[06:05.770 --> 06:11.510]  It's a positive thing. I might be in Twitter jail, but I meant well. I think that's important.
[06:11.710 --> 06:12.830]  You're in Twitter jail?
[06:13.110 --> 06:14.190]  I'm in Twitter jail.
[06:14.590 --> 06:16.410]  Are you, are you a part of the Trump campaign?
[06:16.410 --> 06:20.690]  No, definitely not. I may have made a red hat, not affiliated in any way.
[06:22.570 --> 06:27.670]  I guess I'll get into what happened. It's sort of, I can't even really explain how my brain went there.
[06:27.790 --> 06:30.850]  But yes, I had a really good day yesterday. I was feeling good.
[06:31.010 --> 06:31.590]  That's great.
[06:31.790 --> 06:35.230]  Yeah, it was awesome. I was like, this is a great day. And then I thought,
[06:35.310 --> 06:41.630]  I wonder how other people's days have been. I wonder how's the world doing? And I thought,
[06:41.630 --> 06:46.450]  well, I've got nearly 7,000 followers on Twitter. That's a lot of people live all over the world.
[06:46.550 --> 06:52.150]  I don't know 99% of them. So I thought I'm just going to try to DM every person who follows me.
[06:52.350 --> 06:58.310]  So the other day was to say, hey, how was your day? It's not invasive. It's not an invasive question.
[06:58.470 --> 07:00.830]  Well, I'm now offended that I didn't get shit.
[07:01.190 --> 07:02.270]  Well, I already know you.
[07:02.330 --> 07:03.270]  What do you mean you know me?
[07:03.330 --> 07:07.430]  I didn't get anything either, by the way. Can I ask a real quick aside before you get too deep into
[07:07.430 --> 07:08.790]  this? Was yesterday your birthday?
[07:09.030 --> 07:09.550]  It was.
[07:09.690 --> 07:11.210]  So was this like a weird birthday thing?
[07:11.210 --> 07:13.450]  No, I just had a good day.
[07:13.610 --> 07:18.570]  By the way, I didn't wish you a happy birthday yesterday because I'm still trying not to talk
[07:18.570 --> 07:18.810]  to you.
[07:19.010 --> 07:22.470]  Okay. I had a great day without your talk. So don't feel bad at all.
[07:22.630 --> 07:23.630]  I wished you a happy birthday.
[07:23.870 --> 07:24.270]  You did.
[07:24.290 --> 07:25.150]  I mean, I did on Twitter.
[07:25.370 --> 07:29.650]  But I just wanted to see what people were doing. So I thought, hey, introduce myself.
[07:29.950 --> 07:35.430]  How was your day? Inoffensive question, gets a variety of responses. Curious to just see. And
[07:35.430 --> 07:38.870]  I'll read. I'm sure there'll be some interesting things. I didn't imagine they'd all be interesting,
[07:38.870 --> 07:44.450]  but I communicate with these people. And let me say it takes a long time to send 7,000 Twitter
[07:44.450 --> 07:46.270]  DMs. It is not a quick process.
[07:46.670 --> 07:48.170]  Were these copy and pastes?
[07:48.350 --> 07:52.270]  Yeah, I wrote it out. I was just going profile, click, profile. I was just going down my list.
[07:53.110 --> 07:57.550]  Same message. I did this for about five hours, five or six hours of DMs.
[07:58.070 --> 08:01.930]  And the reason it stopped... I went to bed was the reason it stopped. And then I picked it
[08:01.930 --> 08:07.090]  back up in the morning and discovered that I am now in Twitter jail. I learned that there is a cap
[08:07.090 --> 08:11.830]  to how many DMs you can send in a 24 hour period. And that is 1,000.
[08:11.990 --> 08:12.210]  Wow.
[08:12.450 --> 08:14.550]  You cannot exceed 1,000 DMs.
[08:14.950 --> 08:15.330]  So...
[08:15.330 --> 08:18.010]  So wait, you can't reply to the people replying to you?
[08:18.090 --> 08:21.910]  Well, my plan was I was going to do a day of sending and then a day of replying,
[08:21.970 --> 08:26.690]  because if I try to go in between, it's just too messy. I'd lose track. I would genuinely
[08:26.690 --> 08:28.510]  want to try to reply to all of these.
[08:28.750 --> 08:34.210]  Except your replies will be 24 hours too late for the people and no longer...
[08:34.210 --> 08:38.870]  I didn't know Twitter jail existed when I came up with this premise, Geoff. This is something I
[08:38.870 --> 08:44.250]  learned later. But what was funny about this, and maybe I should have thought about the fact that
[08:44.250 --> 08:49.670]  on the same day, an episode of our podcast dropped that had the name Andrew the Boogeyman.
[08:50.590 --> 08:55.190]  Didn't factor that in. And also, because I wanted to ask the same question to everybody,
[08:55.330 --> 09:00.710]  as it got later, the question became increasingly bizarre. Asking someone how their day is or how
[09:00.710 --> 09:08.890]  their day was, 8pm, totally fine. Asking someone at 2am, how is your day? Weird question. Very
[09:08.890 --> 09:16.010]  strange. But that just created... that added to the mystique of the whole thing. Because when I
[09:16.010 --> 09:21.590]  woke up, to my delight, and I'm going to post this, I hope you guys can both see the Discord chat.
[09:21.870 --> 09:26.010]  I saw this. I told you both to not look at the subreddit, because that was on the front page.
[09:26.210 --> 09:29.330]  And I thought, this is great. I didn't consider this.
[09:29.330 --> 09:34.150]  This is a Reddit post titled, am I being f**ked faced?
[09:36.390 --> 09:41.610]  With three asterisks, which is confusing. So at 1.53am,
[09:42.490 --> 09:49.370]  et Andrew messaged me on Twitter. I'm not sure if he is just bored trying to mess with me,
[09:49.650 --> 09:54.970]  or that he needs help because his vault collapsed. Has he done this to anyone else?
[09:56.210 --> 10:01.130]  First comment, Krampus Andrew strikes again. Second comment, you mean piss boy.
[10:04.190 --> 10:09.830]  So it was well intended, but all these people seem to think that this is some elaborate plan
[10:09.830 --> 10:13.810]  or prank that I have planned. When really, I just wanted to see how people's days were going.
[10:14.110 --> 10:20.410]  You had a genuinely nice day, and you cared for the general population of pretty much
[10:20.410 --> 10:23.410]  strangers. And all you were met with was suspicion.
[10:23.410 --> 10:28.070]  A lot of suspicion. There's an investigation happening. They're working together
[10:28.070 --> 10:32.690]  to try to figure out what my intent was with this, which I think is very fascinating.
[10:33.010 --> 10:36.830]  I may or may not have shared this with a few group chats I'm in,
[10:36.970 --> 10:41.050]  asking them to muddy the case by adding in comments, adding in things that didn't happen,
[10:41.250 --> 10:45.350]  trying to throw them off their investigation a little bit. Because one person got very close,
[10:45.730 --> 10:49.610]  but I don't know what to do now. How do I, do I respond? Like, I think it's funnier if I don't
[10:49.610 --> 10:53.390]  acknowledge this until they hear this episode. Assuming they hear it.
[10:53.470 --> 10:54.690]  Yeah, we're in the middle of something.
[10:54.910 --> 10:55.630]  I mean...
[10:55.630 --> 10:56.410]  What's the approach here?
[10:56.550 --> 11:01.270]  So half of the people you've terrified, because they think you're some sort of digital boogeyman,
[11:01.490 --> 11:04.690]  and the other half are touched that you reached out to them.
[11:04.790 --> 11:05.070]  Yeah!
[11:05.270 --> 11:08.210]  You're kind of fucked, because if you don't respond to those people,
[11:08.570 --> 11:13.210]  then your gesture meant nothing. And if anything, it was worse than not reaching out at all,
[11:13.290 --> 11:17.750]  because you showed an ounce of interest, and then as soon as they responded,
[11:17.750 --> 11:21.730]  you dropped them flatter than a pancake. So you gotta respond to those people,
[11:21.930 --> 11:24.050]  or 500 people are gonna think you're a prick, right?
[11:24.230 --> 11:29.630]  No, I'm definitely gonna respond in the DMs, but I don't know if I should address that thread.
[11:29.750 --> 11:33.710]  I don't know if I should comment about this on Twitter. We have, what, five, six days before
[11:33.710 --> 11:38.010]  this will come out that's room to do whatever we want with this investigation.
[11:38.550 --> 11:38.770]  Yeah.
[11:38.950 --> 11:39.850]  I don't know what to do there.
[11:39.990 --> 11:41.630]  I would just do whatever Gavin says.
[11:42.090 --> 11:43.430]  Okay, what should I do, Gavin?
[11:43.530 --> 11:46.650]  I'm just trying to read what is, uh, yeah, they're all comparing times.
[11:46.650 --> 11:48.190]  Yep, they're cross-referencing.
[11:48.570 --> 11:51.410]  Time zones are a thing. Some of them are, like, 4am.
[11:51.790 --> 11:54.890]  It felt like watching the deleted scenes of Don't Fuck With Cats,
[11:54.990 --> 11:58.130]  like the level of internet investigation that was going on.
[11:58.310 --> 12:01.710]  I thought I was special. Okay, there's some people who are sad that it's clearly a mess.
[12:01.870 --> 12:02.950]  But it rebounded.
[12:03.070 --> 12:06.270]  Oh, Andrew did not message me, I feel left out. Ooh.
[12:07.010 --> 12:10.630]  They weren't in the most recent thousand. There was no bias in this decision.
[12:10.770 --> 12:15.110]  So the people that have been following you for the longest are getting the most slighted.
[12:15.110 --> 12:18.810]  Well, I'm sure they're tired of my shit. They probably regret that follow by this point, so.
[12:18.910 --> 12:20.050]  They wouldn't still be following you.
[12:20.250 --> 12:23.950]  What you should do is find an object that is made up of, like,
[12:24.230 --> 12:27.890]  2,000 pieces and assign each person to get a different piece,
[12:28.070 --> 12:31.050]  so they think you're building some sort of elaborate machine.
[12:31.310 --> 12:32.950]  So what, I need to ask for their address?
[12:33.230 --> 12:37.210]  You think that's really the move the boogeyman does? You think it's a great boogeyman move?
[12:37.590 --> 12:40.870]  Where do you live? Oh, you think I'm Krampus? Tell me your address.
[12:41.290 --> 12:42.610]  Wait, why would you need their address?
[12:42.610 --> 12:45.150]  Well, aren't I mailing them each a piece of a thing?
[12:45.290 --> 12:47.330]  No, they're mailing you pieces of things.
[12:47.430 --> 12:49.090]  So I'm gonna give all these people my address?
[12:49.130 --> 12:50.790]  So he's gonna give a thousand people his address.
[12:51.690 --> 12:54.690]  I like the address idea. I don't know how you get their address,
[12:54.990 --> 12:59.490]  but it would be funny if you drew, like, if you took, like, an all-white puzzle,
[12:59.670 --> 13:03.010]  like a thousand-piece puzzle, because you've talked to a thousand dickheads,
[13:03.270 --> 13:11.890]  and you draw, like, small unfinished pieces of, like, runes and cryptic symbols and shit on it.
[13:11.890 --> 13:16.110]  And then jumble it up, and then mail one piece to each thousand people,
[13:16.370 --> 13:20.590]  and say that if they can combine and get it together and complete the puzzle,
[13:20.730 --> 13:23.950]  it'll solve the mystery and reveal the secrets of something.
[13:24.170 --> 13:25.530]  The secrets of the universe, or whatever.
[13:25.710 --> 13:28.030]  The premise is absolutely brilliant, but instead of a rune,
[13:28.070 --> 13:30.490]  it needs to be the picture of the guy looking up.
[13:30.730 --> 13:35.070]  So we can finally understand what the hell that thing looks like.
[13:35.190 --> 13:35.770]  Fuck! Andrew!
[13:36.410 --> 13:38.950]  Oh, this is great. You can get...
[13:38.950 --> 13:40.750]  This episode's gonna come out too soon.
[13:41.130 --> 13:42.690]  You can get a puzzle made.
[13:43.070 --> 13:45.870]  Millie and my mom, every year for Christmas, give me a thousand-piece puzzle.
[13:46.630 --> 13:50.070]  This is fake call number two, so far.
[13:51.710 --> 13:55.770]  And it'll always be, like, a picture from a vacation of us in front of a waterfall or something.
[13:56.030 --> 13:59.030]  So you could draw the face, and then get it put on a thousand-piece puzzle.
[14:00.130 --> 14:02.610]  That's a great idea, but yeah, once again, we have till Wednesday.
[14:02.910 --> 14:03.750]  Whatever this plan is.
[14:04.850 --> 14:05.650]  Immediately dismissed.
[14:06.110 --> 14:07.490]  Yeah, okay, I got a better idea.
[14:07.490 --> 14:08.810]  Get this puzzle made.
[14:08.930 --> 14:10.650]  If you can't get it made in time, make it yourself.
[14:11.750 --> 14:12.910]  Picture, like, seriously.
[14:13.310 --> 14:17.470]  Then, and this is gonna sound like a lot of work, but you don't have a lot going on,
[14:17.670 --> 14:19.790]  and you already have put a lot of work into this.
[14:19.910 --> 14:21.710]  You underestimate the schedule at Krampus.
[14:23.410 --> 14:26.510]  If you have time to message a thousand people, you have time for this.
[14:26.750 --> 14:29.330]  Also, messaging a thousand people isn't a thousand messages.
[14:29.510 --> 14:31.470]  It's at least two thousand, because you gotta reply.
[14:31.710 --> 14:34.990]  So you had to know that going in, and you were only stopped by Twitter,
[14:35.090 --> 14:36.070]  otherwise you'd still be going.
[14:36.650 --> 14:38.630]  What you do, you get this puzzle.
[14:38.750 --> 14:40.350]  You get it made, or you make it yourself.
[14:40.450 --> 14:42.210]  You Mickey Mouse, like, bullshit, make it yourself.
[14:42.310 --> 14:42.950]  Go to Hobby Lobby.
[14:43.030 --> 14:44.570]  Is there a Hobby Lobby in Canada?
[14:44.810 --> 14:45.610]  Do you have a...
[14:45.610 --> 14:47.870]  Don't use Hobby Lobby, they're anti-gay, or women's rights.
[14:48.530 --> 14:49.450]  Women's reproductive rights.
[14:49.510 --> 14:49.950]  Don't use them.
[14:50.210 --> 14:53.290]  Go to Michael's, or the Canadian equivalent of Michael's...
[14:53.290 --> 14:54.030]  I got a Michael's.
[14:54.150 --> 14:54.550]  Okay, there you go.
[14:54.570 --> 14:55.330]  I can do a Michael's.
[14:55.410 --> 14:58.310]  Make this fucking puzzle, draw the face looking up, right?
[14:58.670 --> 15:01.310]  Then, disassemble the puzzle, jumble it up in the box,
[15:01.630 --> 15:04.910]  then take a piece out, put it on a blank background,
[15:04.910 --> 15:07.570]  like, say, a wooden table, take a photo of it,
[15:07.750 --> 15:09.110]  and mail it to the first person.
[15:09.290 --> 15:13.370]  Then take another puzzle piece out, and put it on the table,
[15:13.510 --> 15:14.590]  and take a photo of it.
[15:14.710 --> 15:18.110]  Do that a thousand times, and let them figure it out.
[15:18.150 --> 15:21.530]  I feel like we said, and I, once again, love your idea.
[15:21.750 --> 15:24.010]  We pitched one idea of a puzzle, said,
[15:24.210 --> 15:26.370]  we have until Wednesday, that's not viable.
[15:26.610 --> 15:28.510]  And then you're like, I got a new plan.
[15:28.890 --> 15:30.330]  Let's make another puzzle.
[15:30.610 --> 15:31.470]  This is viable!
[15:31.830 --> 15:33.130]  How is that viable?
[15:33.310 --> 15:34.330]  Andrew! Come on, man!
[15:34.330 --> 15:35.590]  You don't need their address.
[15:35.730 --> 15:37.830]  You don't need to get a custom puzzle made.
[15:37.930 --> 15:39.410]  You can do it yourself at Michael's.
[15:39.550 --> 15:41.390]  Oh, I'm sending, I'm taking photos.
[15:41.690 --> 15:43.550]  You're gonna take 1,000 photos.
[15:43.790 --> 15:45.870]  Like, you're so busy being Krampus.
[15:46.050 --> 15:48.490]  So it's gonna be a digital puzzle combined.
[15:48.650 --> 15:49.190]  Is that what you're saying?
[15:49.310 --> 15:50.850]  Yeah! And then you just DM them the photo.
[15:51.270 --> 15:52.470]  That, that could work.
[15:52.590 --> 15:53.330]  That's gonna work!
[15:53.410 --> 15:55.490]  That's a better idea than I was anticipating.
[15:55.850 --> 15:57.830]  And I know, I know this is gonna be hard for you.
[15:57.950 --> 15:59.630]  I know it's gonna be hard, because I know your routine,
[15:59.750 --> 16:00.670]  and you love to do it,
[16:00.710 --> 16:03.390]  and it's what you get up and go to bed for every day.
[16:03.390 --> 16:07.170]  But if you take two days off of spying on homeless women
[16:07.170 --> 16:09.230]  peeing in alleyways,
[16:09.770 --> 16:12.470]  the amount of time alone you'll save there,
[16:12.630 --> 16:13.570]  and it's only temporary,
[16:13.970 --> 16:15.510]  you can go back to your Pea Spy.
[16:15.970 --> 16:18.530]  But just for two days, just don't Pea Spy for a little bit,
[16:18.610 --> 16:19.710]  and you'll have time to get this done.
[16:19.950 --> 16:21.450]  I'm on a three-week streak, though.
[16:21.670 --> 16:23.050]  Like, I'm on a hell of a run.
[16:23.970 --> 16:25.210]  You want me to just throw that away?
[16:25.450 --> 16:29.050]  What if, instead of actually physically buying anything
[16:29.050 --> 16:29.890]  or doing that,
[16:30.170 --> 16:32.470]  just draw the damn thing in Photoshop
[16:32.470 --> 16:36.010]  and export, like, a thousand different squares from it
[16:36.010 --> 16:37.350]  and just DM the images?
[16:37.470 --> 16:39.430]  That also works. I like these plants.
[16:39.630 --> 16:41.710]  I don't think that's any easier or harder than my plan.
[16:41.830 --> 16:44.530]  Just pick the one that makes the most sense to you.
[16:44.630 --> 16:47.010]  Okay. I'm probably not gonna do either,
[16:47.290 --> 16:50.010]  but I appreciate both of these great ideas.
[16:50.070 --> 16:51.990]  Why the fuck did you add these-
[16:51.990 --> 16:53.610]  Gavin and I put effort into that.
[16:53.770 --> 16:57.530]  More effort than you're putting into what could be a legendary thing.
[16:57.590 --> 16:59.610]  We came up with that on the fly, Andrew.
[16:59.630 --> 17:00.850]  It just seems like a lot.
[17:00.850 --> 17:04.470]  I gotta get a Michael's, I gotta draw, I gotta take a-
[17:04.470 --> 17:06.410]  No, I'm saying you don't have to go anywhere.
[17:06.630 --> 17:07.830]  You could just make it in Photoshop.
[17:08.030 --> 17:10.770]  I gotta get Photoshop. That seems like it'll work.
[17:11.550 --> 17:13.250]  Talk about stepping up!
[17:13.330 --> 17:14.610]  Bang! Bang!
[17:15.070 --> 17:16.750]  It's time to level up your game.

[17:56.130 --> 17:57.870]  Hey, it's your mobile hotspot.
[17:57.990 --> 18:02.010]  I can handle a lot, but the other night with everyone live-streaming Uncle Miguel at your karaoke party?
[18:02.250 --> 18:06.130]  Here I am, all alone, whispers in my ear.
[18:06.550 --> 18:09.390]  So many devices. I had trouble keeping up.
[18:09.690 --> 18:11.690]  But Cox Home Internet can keep up with all of it.
[18:11.770 --> 18:15.350]  Plus get one unlimited Cox Mobile line free for a whole year when you bundle with Cox Internet.
[18:15.570 --> 18:18.030]  Just $50 a month for 300 megabits per second.
[18:18.450 --> 18:18.990]  Switch today.
[18:19.450 --> 18:22.910]  Mobile speeds reduce to max 1.5 megabits per second after 20 gigabits per month use.
[18:23.070 --> 18:24.190]  Limited time offer, new customers.
[18:24.350 --> 18:25.190]  Actual speeds may vary.
[18:25.190 --> 18:26.210]  Other restrictions may apply.
[18:26.610 --> 18:33.790]  By the way, I've got to point out the audience can't hear this because Geoff is recording his audio on a different mic than the one we can hear him through.
[18:33.930 --> 18:42.850]  But when he gets animated on whatever the hell USB wire plugged into a tin can he's screaming into, it sounds like utter dog shit.
[18:43.090 --> 18:47.310]  I actually am offended that you treat us with this dog shit audio, Geoff.
[18:47.370 --> 18:48.650]  And you have like seven mics.
[18:48.670 --> 18:49.430]  What's happening over there?
[18:49.550 --> 18:50.590]  I don't have seven mics.
[18:50.630 --> 18:51.290]  I have two.
[18:51.290 --> 18:54.130]  And I'm using the new one, which I have.
[18:54.290 --> 18:55.310]  I'll reduce the gain.
[18:55.570 --> 18:58.190]  Well, no, don't reduce the gain on the one you're recording.
[18:58.250 --> 18:59.050]  Don't mess with that one.
[18:59.110 --> 18:59.830]  That's the important one.
[19:00.110 --> 19:01.910]  Well, then stop telling me to do shit.
[19:02.450 --> 19:04.070]  Did you just you just piped up to whine?
[19:05.690 --> 19:07.770]  Andrew, what does he sound like to you?
[19:07.950 --> 19:08.790]  He sounds great to me.
[19:08.850 --> 19:09.630]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[19:09.710 --> 19:10.290]  Are you shitting me?
[19:10.410 --> 19:10.750]  Thank you.
[19:10.750 --> 19:11.470]  He sounds fine to me.
[19:11.570 --> 19:14.770]  I bet he's rooted his nice mic to you personally.
[19:15.090 --> 19:17.030]  And he's literally sending me the shite.
[19:17.030 --> 19:21.830]  This is why this feeds right into a talking point I have about you later, Gavin.
[19:22.190 --> 19:26.350]  And how a thing that I think should make me feel bad actually makes me feel good.
[19:26.470 --> 19:27.610]  Oh, Eric chimed in, by the way.
[19:27.710 --> 19:28.350]  I'm with Gavin.
[19:28.670 --> 19:29.950]  Yeah, you sound like shit to Eric.
[19:30.070 --> 19:31.370]  I'm gonna have to side with them then.
[19:31.450 --> 19:33.950]  I just don't think I hear what shit sounds like.
[19:34.070 --> 19:35.770]  And I don't want to be on team wrong.
[19:36.130 --> 19:36.870]  So I'm gonna flip.
[19:37.030 --> 19:38.010]  I'm sorry, I'm flipping.
[19:38.390 --> 19:39.270]  You sound like shit.
[19:39.410 --> 19:39.670]  Okay.
[19:39.970 --> 19:40.530]  I'll tell you what.
[19:40.650 --> 19:42.430]  I'll uh... nah, fuck it.
[19:42.710 --> 19:43.030]  Fuck y'all.
[19:43.190 --> 19:44.290]  I'm gonna sound like shit forever.
[19:44.290 --> 19:47.490]  If I can figure out a way to make it worse, I will.
[19:48.730 --> 19:54.350]  And I'll put the effort into making it sound worse that you lazy, non-picture, non-photoshopping
[19:54.350 --> 19:56.910]  DMing a thousand people motherfuckers won't do.
[19:57.350 --> 19:58.790]  That was quite the sentence.
[19:59.010 --> 19:59.210]  Thank you.
[19:59.230 --> 20:01.010]  I'm gonna tip my hat to you on that.
[20:01.050 --> 20:02.410]  Geoff's coming a little hot this week.
[20:02.630 --> 20:04.450]  I'm a little hot, yeah.
[20:04.610 --> 20:05.650]  Yeah, a little upset.
[20:05.830 --> 20:07.210]  How many spam calls have you got recently?
[20:07.390 --> 20:09.670]  Is that influencing maybe your opinion?
[20:09.950 --> 20:10.470]  Maybe it is.
[20:11.710 --> 20:13.450]  Listen, F1 is going strong.
[20:13.450 --> 20:15.070]  The NBA is back.
[20:15.430 --> 20:17.050]  Fucking spam call!
[20:18.510 --> 20:19.230]  Who was that?
[20:19.270 --> 20:19.930]  Who called that number?
[20:20.150 --> 20:20.690]  Was that you, Gavin?
[20:21.070 --> 20:21.450]  No!
[20:21.770 --> 20:22.570]  It's one of you guys.
[20:22.850 --> 20:25.310]  If I called you, it would come up as my number.
[20:25.530 --> 20:27.210]  You use Meg's number or something?
[20:27.670 --> 20:28.910]  You've got her number too!
[20:29.110 --> 20:29.870]  Oh, that's true.
[20:30.090 --> 20:30.490]  That's true.
[20:31.410 --> 20:35.210]  I've never seen somebody so confidently yell something so clearly wrong.
[20:35.450 --> 20:38.230]  Well, because I felt like I could hear it immediately in somebody else's line.
[20:38.230 --> 20:40.790]  I mean, if anyone's got a burner phone ready to play pranks,
[20:40.910 --> 20:42.830]  it's definitely Andrew the Krampus Boogie Man.
[20:42.830 --> 20:44.950]  No, how dare you?
[20:45.150 --> 20:47.630]  How dare you make such accusations?
[20:48.150 --> 20:49.430]  Is it really you, Andrew?
[20:49.750 --> 20:50.970]  No, not me.
[20:51.050 --> 20:52.990]  That would be a bad accusation.
[20:53.290 --> 20:54.190]  I wouldn't do that.
[20:54.590 --> 20:55.630]  Not me at all.
[20:55.690 --> 20:56.170]  Let me know.
[20:56.350 --> 20:56.590]  Yeah.
[20:56.710 --> 20:57.150]  I got that.
[20:57.250 --> 20:58.930]  I got my finger.
[20:59.270 --> 21:03.310]  I got my hand, my left hand on one key, my right hand on the other key.
[21:03.490 --> 21:07.050]  And I can just, all I got to do is turn left and turn right.
[21:07.110 --> 21:09.070]  And I drop the nuclear football on your house.
[21:09.170 --> 21:10.530]  Another fucking call.
[21:10.790 --> 21:11.210]  Gotta be.
[21:11.890 --> 21:14.510]  I feel like I can hear it in the audio when someone's calling.
[21:14.610 --> 21:14.970]  It goes like...
[21:16.230 --> 21:19.070]  That's why I know it's one of you fuckers.
[21:19.110 --> 21:19.650]  It's probably Eric.
[21:20.610 --> 21:22.590]  It's an LA number, which would make sense,
[21:22.650 --> 21:25.890]  because he's too embarrassed to acknowledge being from San Diego with a San Diego number.
[21:27.390 --> 21:28.290]  I don't hear it.
[21:28.450 --> 21:29.190]  Well, it's off now.
[21:29.550 --> 21:35.050]  So before we move on, Andrew, obviously you've asked us for our ideas of what you should do
[21:35.050 --> 21:37.170]  and shut it all down, which is fair.
[21:37.430 --> 21:38.530]  But what did you have any plan?
[21:38.690 --> 21:39.870]  No, that's why I asked you guys.
[21:39.930 --> 21:40.510]  I have no plan.
[21:40.510 --> 21:43.310]  I feel like I've done a lot of work here with this.
[21:43.690 --> 21:44.810]  I was looking for suggestions.
[21:44.930 --> 21:45.630]  I'm not disappointed.
[21:45.790 --> 21:46.790]  You guys had great ideas.
[21:47.090 --> 21:48.950]  I just need to figure out how to make that work.
[21:49.170 --> 21:50.390]  That's not an immediate thing.
[21:50.430 --> 21:51.750]  But I like the online thing.
[21:51.870 --> 21:52.470]  We have a deadline.
[21:52.810 --> 21:57.890]  Yeah, just like a mass puzzle that the only people who can be involved are already involved,
[21:58.010 --> 21:59.490]  and they don't necessarily know it.
[21:59.690 --> 22:02.570]  What if you create a forum online?
[22:02.690 --> 22:04.930]  Just like a PHP BB forum or whatever.
[22:05.450 --> 22:08.430]  I realize it's not 2003 when I created Rooster Teeth,
[22:08.430 --> 22:11.110]  but I assume there's some new version of that.
[22:11.270 --> 22:14.410]  You're gonna need to explain to me what the abbreviation is first before you continue.
[22:14.670 --> 22:15.470]  I'm already lost.
[22:15.570 --> 22:16.970]  It's PHP Bulletin Board, right?
[22:17.070 --> 22:19.470]  That's the first forum we use that Rooster Teeth.
[22:19.630 --> 22:21.150]  Yeah, Geoff's down with the kids.
[22:22.830 --> 22:24.930]  Because, you know, he knows already as well.
[22:24.990 --> 22:27.410]  They're into TikTok and PHP BB forums.
[22:27.690 --> 22:29.410]  You were on that forum, by the way, you little prick.
[22:29.610 --> 22:31.610]  I was, but I'm also 35.
[22:32.290 --> 22:32.790]  I'm 32.
[22:33.050 --> 22:33.730]  You're not 35.
[22:33.850 --> 22:36.350]  Okay, you ride a bicycle like you're 65.
[22:39.010 --> 22:40.410]  Yours was electric.
[22:40.650 --> 22:40.930]  It's bullshit.
[22:40.930 --> 22:41.890]  All right, all right, all right.
[22:42.270 --> 22:43.410]  It's partially electric.
[22:43.550 --> 22:44.230]  What does that mean?
[22:44.470 --> 22:45.510]  It has pedal assist.
[22:45.770 --> 22:48.470]  And I didn't need any assistance to go faster than my grandma.
[22:48.750 --> 22:50.790]  Both brakes look the same, don't they, on most bikes?
[22:51.050 --> 22:51.250]  Yeah.
[22:51.330 --> 22:52.650]  That's a terrible design.
[22:52.750 --> 22:53.650]  I don't know why they do that.
[22:53.730 --> 22:54.090]  What do you mean?
[22:54.230 --> 22:57.290]  Well, the front brake and back brake should look completely different.
[22:57.470 --> 22:58.870]  You don't want to accidentally hit the...
[22:58.870 --> 23:01.770]  Nobody ever wants to hit the front brake unless it's an emergency.
[23:02.010 --> 23:05.030]  But usually you learn as a kid which side is which.
[23:05.170 --> 23:07.510]  And as they say, it's like riding a bike.
[23:07.510 --> 23:11.850]  You're not supposed to forget, but I found out that that's entirely true.
[23:11.990 --> 23:13.550]  It's a 50-50 shot.
[23:13.690 --> 23:14.310]  It is.
[23:14.490 --> 23:15.470]  It's a dangerous thing.
[23:15.570 --> 23:18.250]  We're getting far away from my brilliant bulletin board idea.
[23:18.610 --> 23:23.590]  Okay, but it's like if you had a seatbelt and one button ejected the seatbelt and the
[23:23.590 --> 23:25.430]  other button shot the seat through the car.
[23:26.370 --> 23:28.070]  Why is it the same thing?
[23:28.450 --> 23:30.190]  Why don't they look radically different?
[23:30.370 --> 23:33.430]  But Andrew, you're describing two things that do radically different things.
[23:33.690 --> 23:35.130]  Both brakes do the same thing.
[23:35.390 --> 23:36.590]  They just stop different parts of the bike.
[23:36.590 --> 23:39.990]  Yeah, but one's an eat shit brake and the other is like, I want to stop brake.
[23:40.050 --> 23:44.550]  If you apply them at the same time, then they both work perfectly.
[23:45.090 --> 23:46.750]  I definitely almost ate shit.
[23:47.270 --> 23:51.550]  I went so far forwards, I had to put my foot down, but the bike kept going forwards.
[23:51.910 --> 23:55.810]  So the bar in between the handlebars and the seat hit me in the genitals.
[23:56.030 --> 23:56.810]  It was fucking funny.
[23:57.010 --> 23:59.650]  Are you supposed to hit both brakes at the same time?
[23:59.830 --> 24:01.170]  If you want to stop properly.
[24:01.430 --> 24:01.990]  Are you serious?
[24:02.390 --> 24:07.410]  Yeah, because the back one just skids and the front one, the bike stops and you don't.
[24:07.470 --> 24:09.030]  I've been a back brake guy my whole life.
[24:09.130 --> 24:11.130]  You're unduly wearing down your back brakes.
[24:11.310 --> 24:14.510]  It's like saying, like, are you supposed to keep both hands on the handlebars?
[24:14.690 --> 24:17.210]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, but, you know, take one off, take both off.
[24:17.510 --> 24:18.510]  It's a bike.
[24:18.690 --> 24:22.410]  If you're going to do a cool ass slide like Gavin, use the back brakes.
[24:22.770 --> 24:25.430]  You want to spray some gravel at your friend? You just use the back brakes.
[24:25.590 --> 24:27.850]  You want to do an endo? Use the front brakes.
[24:27.850 --> 24:31.850]  You want to stop like a normal human being and not drive into traffic or risk
[24:31.850 --> 24:34.270]  getting pitched over and killed? Use both brakes.
[24:34.550 --> 24:35.970]  That's why you have both brakes.
[24:36.250 --> 24:38.870]  Use both, but with the back coming slightly before the front.
[24:39.090 --> 24:40.810]  Okay, well, good to know. I didn't know that.
[24:40.930 --> 24:44.630]  I always, I thought it was just back brake if you want to stop, front brake if you want to crash.
[24:44.910 --> 24:45.690]  I appreciate the clarity.
[24:46.090 --> 24:49.010]  So what I was saying is, I was trying to explain this to Gavin because he's 35 now.
[24:50.010 --> 24:52.370]  You would recognize it as a PHP BB forum.
[24:52.590 --> 24:54.970]  But today the kids use something called Discord.
[24:55.570 --> 24:57.710]  You're probably not familiar with that, Gavin, because you're so old.
[24:57.710 --> 25:02.290]  What I think you should do is you should create a private Discord server
[25:02.830 --> 25:05.490]  with an ominous name, or maybe even no name.
[25:06.230 --> 25:12.470]  Or a Krampus, or Pissboy Incorporated, whatever, whatever your favorite nickname is right now.
[25:12.950 --> 25:17.630]  And send out an invite to all those thousand people, and that's it.
[25:17.810 --> 25:19.110]  I just never like even enter.
[25:19.270 --> 25:22.590]  Check in in one week and see what happened.
[25:22.590 --> 25:26.110]  Can I create a Discord, then leave the Discord,
[25:26.330 --> 25:28.210]  and then invite people to that Discord?
[25:28.390 --> 25:29.170]  Because that'd be pretty funny.
[25:29.350 --> 25:30.370]  Yeah, maybe. I don't know.
[25:30.470 --> 25:32.410]  But then what do we get out of that? We don't know how it ended.
[25:32.710 --> 25:34.070]  We know in our heart it's going to be good.
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.510]  We don't need to know the result.
[25:35.630 --> 25:37.870]  We'll know what happens when Andrew checks in in a week,
[25:37.930 --> 25:41.110]  and then he sits here for 45 minutes and reads this funny shit.
[25:41.270 --> 25:43.650]  There will be a post on the subreddit.
[25:43.690 --> 25:45.730]  We'll know about it. It'll be just like the first thing.
[25:45.830 --> 25:46.190]  That's true.
[25:46.210 --> 25:46.710]  It'll be a continuation.
[25:47.070 --> 25:49.150]  I would have hoped the Discord would have occurred naturally.
[25:49.150 --> 25:52.890]  If everyone got like a single piece of the man looking up puzzle,
[25:53.030 --> 25:54.950]  I think they would have had to have formed a Discord,
[25:55.190 --> 25:56.630]  or it would have just been on the subreddit.
[25:56.830 --> 25:59.270]  But I do like the idea of you inviting everyone to a Discord,
[25:59.490 --> 26:00.950]  and none of them know why they're there.
[26:01.150 --> 26:01.250]  Yeah.
[26:01.370 --> 26:02.630]  They're all wondering what it is.
[26:02.730 --> 26:03.870]  It's a great social experiment.
[26:04.190 --> 26:07.170]  You just put a thousand random people in a room together and see what happens.
[26:07.250 --> 26:09.050]  It's like a Battle Royale, but they're all confused.
[26:09.410 --> 26:10.130]  There's no violence.
[26:10.330 --> 26:12.170]  It's a Battle Royale, but they don't know they're playing.
[26:12.330 --> 26:12.450]  Yeah.
[26:12.450 --> 26:14.250]  Why does it have to be a Battle Royale?
[26:14.310 --> 26:15.790]  Why can't it be like a book club?
[26:16.210 --> 26:17.070]  I don't know.
[26:17.170 --> 26:20.450]  When I think of a bunch of people dropping in suddenly to a thing,
[26:20.510 --> 26:21.530]  I think Battle Royale.
[26:21.850 --> 26:23.130]  That's just where my head works.
[26:23.230 --> 26:24.130]  We could definitely do this,
[26:24.190 --> 26:28.670]  and you could report back next week or the week after on what they ended up talking about.
[26:28.790 --> 26:29.510]  Yeah, do that.
[26:29.570 --> 26:30.790]  And also, how about this?
[26:30.870 --> 26:31.210]  Oh, wow.
[26:31.230 --> 26:32.310]  I got another fucking call.
[26:32.570 --> 26:33.670]  How about this?
[26:33.950 --> 26:34.790]  We drop them in.
[26:34.850 --> 26:35.710]  You do the whole thing.
[26:35.990 --> 26:37.050]  We check back in in a week,
[26:37.090 --> 26:42.050]  and then we can cut this thing I'm about to say out of the podcast if this is such a good idea.
[26:42.690 --> 26:43.710]  And then we'll come back in.
[26:43.710 --> 26:47.710]  But what if the point of it is to see who the last person in the room is?
[26:48.150 --> 26:49.190]  Like Battle Royale.
[26:49.590 --> 26:51.830]  And so when there's one person left in the Discord,
[26:51.970 --> 26:53.990]  or the last person to leave the Discord or whatever,
[26:54.310 --> 26:55.830]  or if it's not Discord, some other kind of forum,
[26:55.990 --> 26:57.010]  then we give them a present.
[26:57.250 --> 26:58.930]  Like, congratulations, you won Andrew.
[26:59.150 --> 27:01.130]  You get a pissboy t-shirt.
[27:01.270 --> 27:02.570]  Once again, though...
[27:02.570 --> 27:03.110]  Oh, never mind.
[27:03.210 --> 27:05.850]  Or you get a Russian fuckhat shirt or something.
[27:06.350 --> 27:06.630]  Sure.
[27:07.370 --> 27:07.730]  Perfect.
[27:08.070 --> 27:09.330]  And then there is a point to it,
[27:09.370 --> 27:10.210]  and they just never knew.
[27:10.450 --> 27:12.370]  So a hat becomes a shirt.
[27:12.590 --> 27:13.410]  The hat did become a shirt.
[27:13.410 --> 27:14.070]  Yeah, so hold on.
[27:14.490 --> 27:15.490]  Alright, coming back in,
[27:15.630 --> 27:19.930]  I'm assuming that idea, that little bit was cut because my idea was brilliant.
[27:20.210 --> 27:22.610]  You're declaring that idea so good we had to cut it?
[27:24.210 --> 27:26.470]  It'll spoil the point of the thing!
[27:26.970 --> 27:27.910]  No, that's fine.
[27:27.970 --> 27:29.050]  Don't make any edits.
[27:29.990 --> 27:30.790]  It's fine.
[27:31.170 --> 27:32.150]  It was a great idea, Geoff.
[27:32.250 --> 27:32.750]  I don't care.
[27:32.830 --> 27:33.670]  Do whatever the fuck you want.
[27:33.990 --> 27:34.790]  So we have a shirt.
[27:35.010 --> 27:35.910]  We've got a fucked up shirt.
[27:36.090 --> 27:39.370]  So we went hard with, uh, you know, the amazing shirt pro-
[27:39.370 --> 27:42.030]  Oh, the amazing hat prototype that you posted last week,
[27:42.030 --> 27:45.950]  which you can see on, uh, if you watch this on the site, it's like in the video.
[27:46.110 --> 27:46.970]  And it's on Andrew's Twitter.
[27:47.330 --> 27:52.470]  However, according to Eric, slight difficulties in actually making a hat that looks like that.
[27:52.710 --> 27:58.110]  So Eric came, or I guess the store came up with the, uh, the compromise of a hat shirt.
[27:58.750 --> 28:00.090]  I see that. It's a beautiful thing.
[28:00.370 --> 28:01.490]  I didn't know this.
[28:01.650 --> 28:05.130]  You'd think Eric would tell the fucked hat guy this whole thing.
[28:05.210 --> 28:08.090]  I was the only one apparently not told that this was in the works.
[28:08.290 --> 28:09.710]  Yeah, it was, it was kept from you.
[28:09.710 --> 28:11.930]  It was kept from me, which is a great surprise.
[28:12.250 --> 28:15.710]  But what you need to respect is the ambition of Krampus.
[28:15.790 --> 28:18.590]  Krampus has ambition. He believes in things.
[28:19.230 --> 28:21.450]  And, uh, this is really unfortunate.
[28:21.650 --> 28:25.710]  I'm trying to click to my photos, but my fire extinguisher is blocking my monitor.
[28:26.050 --> 28:27.810]  So I'm going to have to move.
[28:28.290 --> 28:31.310]  Okay, so I introduced the fuck hat last time.
[28:31.810 --> 28:32.870]  People loved it.
[28:33.070 --> 28:34.570]  Response yesterday was ridiculous.
[28:35.170 --> 28:36.630]  People love the fucked up fuck hat.
[28:36.770 --> 28:37.550]  It's a great thing.
[28:37.710 --> 28:38.290]  It was amazing.
[28:38.290 --> 28:42.030]  What you guys don't know about it, it's funnier than you even realize.
[28:42.210 --> 28:44.590]  It is a worse hat than you could even imagine.
[28:44.930 --> 28:47.750]  I had the person who designed the hat, they put it on,
[28:47.950 --> 28:49.730]  they sent me a photo of themselves wearing it.
[28:49.890 --> 28:51.490]  Look at this monstrosity.
[28:51.730 --> 28:53.330]  The letters are for the birds.
[28:53.770 --> 28:55.730]  Look at how high it is.
[28:57.170 --> 29:01.310]  I really, I don't feel like we have enough hats that cater to people that are above you.
[29:01.670 --> 29:05.850]  So, I really, uh, appreciate the design.
[29:05.970 --> 29:07.870]  How does this hat keep getting better?
[29:08.290 --> 29:10.270]  Look at it! It's so shit!
[29:10.510 --> 29:11.230]  That's the worst!
[29:12.030 --> 29:13.450]  It's really bad.
[29:13.770 --> 29:14.870]  It's a great hat.
[29:15.270 --> 29:16.430]  Eric made a great point.
[29:16.550 --> 29:18.130]  This is a short person's hat.
[29:18.290 --> 29:20.670]  It'll look great if you're below 5'2".
[29:20.670 --> 29:21.510]  It's a kid's hat.
[29:21.650 --> 29:24.030]  It's a hat for people who are 5'2 or under.
[29:24.370 --> 29:24.970]  That's great.
[29:25.170 --> 29:26.090]  It's a great hat.
[29:26.550 --> 29:29.130]  But, with that being said, uh,
[29:29.530 --> 29:33.550]  Geoff, you have your own line of clothing, which is very popular,
[29:33.810 --> 29:35.810]  and I hate to step on your territory,
[29:35.810 --> 29:40.590]  but I felt like this was the perfect time to unveil the Pantin line,
[29:40.870 --> 29:43.730]  which, uh, is guaranteed to be absolute hit.
[29:43.790 --> 29:47.290]  I'm sure the store is frantically working, so I went back to my guy,
[29:47.490 --> 29:48.370]  and I said, we need more.
[29:48.430 --> 29:49.810]  We need a line of these.
[29:50.230 --> 29:52.210]  Because this is, this is a great invention.
[29:52.610 --> 29:54.070]  So I'm going to unveil to you all today,
[29:54.290 --> 29:57.790]  what better way to unveil a clothing line than on an audio-only podcast?
[29:58.210 --> 30:00.670]  But let me unveil the Pantin line of hats.
[30:02.030 --> 30:03.070]  Variety of colors.
[30:03.950 --> 30:06.230]  Everyone, you can pick on your,
[30:06.370 --> 30:09.010]  they're all a little different, but they're all special.
[30:09.250 --> 30:12.790]  They're all beautiful in your heart.
[30:13.330 --> 30:15.430]  That's so consistently shit.
[30:15.730 --> 30:17.250]  I don't know how they're doing it.
[30:17.330 --> 30:18.430]  It is a great hat.
[30:18.610 --> 30:20.670]  The only way you can show it off is,
[30:20.730 --> 30:23.630]  is by like taking that downward selfie angle picture,
[30:23.690 --> 30:24.710]  because it's from the top.
[30:24.910 --> 30:25.790]  That's so good.
[30:26.010 --> 30:29.050]  Yeah, it's a great, it's a wonderful hat that I'm sure the store
[30:29.050 --> 30:30.770]  desperately wants to sell.
[30:30.830 --> 30:31.870]  It's part of the Pantin line.
[30:31.870 --> 30:34.890]  Are they, what file are they printing?
[30:35.070 --> 30:38.050]  Is it just the same original design that you gave them?
[30:38.150 --> 30:41.290]  Or did you just say, print those letters and just tell them?
[30:41.530 --> 30:42.630]  No, it was a design.
[30:42.830 --> 30:45.730]  I think the actual design looks totally fine.
[30:45.850 --> 30:48.330]  It's in the making of the hat in which it all falls apart.
[30:48.650 --> 30:50.630]  See, that's why it's so hard for us to make it.
[30:50.690 --> 30:54.670]  I just love how the C turned into like a fat dove.
[30:56.030 --> 30:58.090]  It is. It's a beautiful fat dove.
[30:58.250 --> 31:00.190]  The C is slightly different on all of them.
[31:00.190 --> 31:07.250]  And what I'm going to call the H of the F word is a slightly different length.
[31:07.650 --> 31:10.530]  I like that the one on the right, the F came through finally.
[31:10.810 --> 31:11.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:11.750 --> 31:13.470]  The worst F is on the middle.
[31:13.810 --> 31:14.610]  What has gone on there?
[31:14.890 --> 31:16.650]  They're all disastrous in their own way.
[31:16.750 --> 31:19.690]  But Pantin, the Pantin line has a limited budget.
[31:20.030 --> 31:23.370]  So if we were to go forward with one of these hats,
[31:23.590 --> 31:24.830]  which one would we go with?
[31:24.850 --> 31:25.290]  What color?
[31:25.390 --> 31:26.070]  What are you guys thinking?
[31:26.250 --> 31:30.010]  I think the mess of the red hat on the black hat.
[31:30.410 --> 31:33.210]  We can't design the mess. The mess is what it is.
[31:33.290 --> 31:33.890]  It's like art.
[31:34.410 --> 31:38.690]  The nice kind of thing is each one of these hats is like a snowflake, right?
[31:38.930 --> 31:39.590]  I mean, it's like a fingerprint.
[31:39.590 --> 31:39.690]  Yeah, exactly.
[31:40.310 --> 31:42.010]  And no one, no two are the same.
[31:42.450 --> 31:44.670]  So you're getting, it's like getting a Damien Hirst.
[31:44.830 --> 31:46.830]  Like each one's unique and different in its own way.
[31:46.850 --> 31:50.390]  Yeah, I will say I like the white on black.
[31:50.530 --> 31:52.890]  I don't like that the F is perfect.
[31:53.150 --> 31:55.350]  Or 90% there on the black though.
[31:55.390 --> 31:58.170]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's just, you know, it's the thing that happens.
[31:58.660 --> 32:00.370]  As Geoff said, there's snowflakes.
[32:00.710 --> 32:04.850]  And there's no yellow thread going through it on the black or white ones.
[32:05.150 --> 32:10.830]  I still think the red is the best one, but it's such a problematic color in our current climate,
[32:10.950 --> 32:11.230]  you know?
[32:11.290 --> 32:13.530]  But you know, that is the ultimate f*** face.
[32:13.670 --> 32:15.550]  It is a pretty hard f*** face.
[32:15.630 --> 32:19.090]  It's to sell a hat that people don't want to wear.
[32:19.190 --> 32:22.170]  But our branding is black. The shirt is black. It would go with the shirt.
[32:22.290 --> 32:24.430]  Well, the shirt is red. Have you seen the shirt mockup?
[32:24.510 --> 32:27.430]  Well, no, the other shirt, I'm saying the f*** face shirt is black.
[32:27.430 --> 32:29.590]  To this point, we only have one shirt out.
[32:29.690 --> 32:30.550]  The hat shirt is red.
[32:30.810 --> 32:32.650]  Yeah, but we can change the color of the hat shirt.
[32:32.770 --> 32:34.750]  I think it's red. I think it's got to be a red hat.
[32:34.970 --> 32:37.170]  I think Gavin's right. It's the ultimate f*** face.
[32:37.330 --> 32:37.570]  Yeah.
[32:37.690 --> 32:39.190]  It's so the wrong decision.
[32:39.310 --> 32:42.930]  It's not. It shouldn't. That's a terrible idea.
[32:43.010 --> 32:48.590]  If 100 people picked the best choice, 99 of them wouldn't pick that red hat,
[32:48.670 --> 32:52.550]  which is why it has to be the goddamn red hat.
[32:53.170 --> 32:55.450]  Goddamn it! We have to sell a goddamn red hat.
[32:55.550 --> 32:56.290]  I don't think we do.
[32:56.290 --> 32:57.950]  It says a folded f***.
[32:58.150 --> 32:58.390]  Yeah.
[32:58.630 --> 33:03.570]  Oh, we do. We do. We do. We do. It's such a f*** face. It's f***ing our own faces.
[33:03.850 --> 33:05.010]  Another phone call, by the way.
[33:05.130 --> 33:10.610]  Selling a red hat with white text between the years of 2016 and 2024 is suicide,
[33:11.010 --> 33:12.190]  but I think it has to be done.
[33:12.550 --> 33:15.470]  I don't think it has to be done. I think we should go black.
[33:15.730 --> 33:16.830]  I think it should be a black hat.
[33:16.890 --> 33:20.010]  Dude, it's because you're not a real f*** face. You're not thinking. You're thinking fashion.
[33:20.290 --> 33:22.630]  No, I don't want to align with the red.
[33:22.810 --> 33:23.110]  I know.
[33:23.410 --> 33:24.230]  The red is a bad idea.
[33:24.230 --> 33:26.370]  Nobody does, but that's what you gave us.
[33:26.370 --> 33:29.250]  You clearly do. You're fighting for it. What do you mean nobody does?
[33:29.510 --> 33:30.770]  You're arguing for it.
[33:30.830 --> 33:32.450]  I'm fighting for the brand f*** face, Andrew.
[33:32.650 --> 33:35.290]  I'm fighting for the brand f*** face. I don't want to sell a red hat.
[33:35.430 --> 33:36.470]  The red hat's a bad idea.
[33:36.610 --> 33:37.570]  How about we sell both?
[33:37.710 --> 33:39.450]  No! No! How about we don't?
[33:39.630 --> 33:40.470]  Wait a minute. Why not?
[33:40.690 --> 33:41.170]  Why no?
[33:41.290 --> 33:45.130]  Why don't we sell the black one? Why are we selling the red one? Nobody wants the red one.
[33:45.170 --> 33:53.450]  Because true, true f*** face listeners, the ones who align with f*** facing, will buy the red one.
[33:53.450 --> 33:55.090]  I f***ing hate you guys.
[33:56.290 --> 33:57.270]  Absolute worst.
[33:57.430 --> 34:00.170]  Here's the deal. It's a f***ing f*** face collectible.
[34:00.230 --> 34:06.330]  What about a limited run of the red one? Like, we'll only sell 100 red ones and the rest will be black.
[34:06.570 --> 34:10.830]  I'm gonna strangle both of you. You'll be both absolute worst.
[34:11.030 --> 34:12.630]  Andrew, this is your doing.
[34:12.890 --> 34:18.550]  I know it's my doing. You f***ing assholes that don't remember from two weeks ago,
[34:18.890 --> 34:22.870]  you goddamn idiots, were both anti-red two weeks ago.
[34:22.950 --> 34:23.110]  Yeah.
[34:23.110 --> 34:24.750]  You couldn't have been more anti-red.
[34:24.770 --> 34:28.330]  I listened to that conversation back and I was like, that's not the f*** face move.
[34:28.470 --> 34:32.610]  Just take one quick step back and look at this conversation in its totality.
[34:32.750 --> 34:37.250]  Gavin and I are laughing and miserable because we know the way forward.
[34:37.450 --> 34:43.330]  Andrew, you're just miserable. You created a thing and now you're trying so hard to
[34:43.330 --> 34:47.410]  change it or get out from under it. And that's the essence of what we do.
[34:47.530 --> 34:48.950]  No, I like the thing.
[34:48.950 --> 34:55.050]  You f*** face. There is nothing. Your misery right now is nourishing this podcast.
[34:55.610 --> 35:00.110]  And it's gotta be a red f*** face hat because of how much you hate it.
[35:00.210 --> 35:05.030]  No, well, we all hate it. Okay. I don't think we all want the red hat. We don't want the red hat.
[35:05.130 --> 35:05.890]  No, absolutely not.
[35:06.450 --> 35:10.630]  The red hat's a bad idea. I don't know why you're arguing for the red hat.
[35:10.730 --> 35:13.910]  I live in Austin. I could get killed if I wore a red hat around town.
[35:13.910 --> 35:20.570]  This is my counter. You're arguing that the most f*** faceable thing is to go with the red hat
[35:20.570 --> 35:23.490]  because it is associated with something that none of us support.
[35:23.930 --> 35:28.910]  And that, therefore, it is the funniest because it is against what we believe in
[35:28.910 --> 35:30.590]  and it's the shittiest hat color to sell.
[35:30.690 --> 35:33.990]  Here's what we'll do. What if we put the picture up on... you post the picture on Twitter.
[35:34.370 --> 35:34.470]  No.
[35:34.650 --> 35:35.750]  We let the audience vote.
[35:35.810 --> 35:36.030]  No.
[35:36.170 --> 35:37.650]  No, no, listen, listen. I'm not done.
[35:37.670 --> 35:39.990]  I'm listening to you. I wasn't done either, but continue.
[35:40.170 --> 35:42.870]  No, then you'll finish. Then you'll do... I'm so sorry I interrupted you, sweetie,
[35:42.870 --> 35:44.770]  but I'm gonna let you finish.
[35:45.170 --> 35:45.650]  Okay, girl master.
[35:45.810 --> 35:49.470]  We put it up there. We let the audience vote on it. And the one that they like the least
[35:49.470 --> 35:50.690]  is the one we make.
[35:51.010 --> 35:51.190]  Nope.
[35:51.230 --> 35:52.290]  They were f***ing them and us.
[35:52.410 --> 35:54.270]  No, let me go into this.
[35:54.450 --> 35:54.650]  Okay.
[35:55.050 --> 35:59.550]  This was unbelievable. You two are the absolute worst ever.
[35:59.790 --> 36:04.210]  I am honestly so surprised that you can't see this from our point of view, Andrew.
[36:04.590 --> 36:08.090]  Let me explain why. Quit interrupting.
[36:09.370 --> 36:11.910]  Jesus Christ. I'm trying to get there.
[36:11.910 --> 36:15.590]  Everyone agreed on the black hat a week ago. To quote Gavin,
[36:15.830 --> 36:19.870]  I wouldn't wear the red one, but I would absolutely buy the black one.
[36:19.970 --> 36:21.310]  Can confirm. I did say that.
[36:21.470 --> 36:26.170]  When I showed the Payton line of three hats, I thought, okay, I'm going to show this line.
[36:26.410 --> 36:29.550]  Nobody's going to pick white. White is boring. That's fine.
[36:29.750 --> 36:34.710]  They already said they dislike the red, so there's no point doing the red.
[36:34.990 --> 36:37.350]  So I went ahead. This was all for show.
[36:37.350 --> 36:42.110]  This wasn't really a question. This wasn't an actual conversation.
[36:42.370 --> 36:43.950]  This wasn't a meeting about the merch.
[36:44.310 --> 36:47.410]  This was not a merch meeting. This was just for show.
[36:47.670 --> 36:51.710]  Little bit of advice. Don't ask the question if you don't want the answer.
[36:51.990 --> 36:55.250]  Fucking don't answer the question and then change your answer. How about that?
[36:56.210 --> 37:00.050]  I'm much like the audience is allowed to change their mind on how they're doing
[37:00.050 --> 37:02.650]  seven days later when you finally respond to them.
[37:02.910 --> 37:06.870]  I'm allowed to change my mind. Wasn't a week ago, by the way. It was two weeks ago now.
[37:06.870 --> 37:10.270]  I realized it was two weeks ago. I didn't expect you to go fucking red.
[37:10.510 --> 37:13.310]  Nobody goes red. The whole goddamn country went red.
[37:13.510 --> 37:17.030]  Look at all the fucking black hats I made. What am I supposed to do with the black hats?
[37:17.250 --> 37:20.730]  Oh, God. Let me let you post a picture now. I made a lot of black hats.
[37:20.850 --> 37:23.790]  Oh, my God. They're all so different. What is wrong with you?
[37:23.870 --> 37:25.890]  I love it. It's the paint line.
[37:26.150 --> 37:28.750]  Dude, this is so good. Here's what you do.
[37:28.910 --> 37:32.710]  Give them to the first 10 people that join your Discord server.
[37:32.850 --> 37:35.490]  We're selling these fucking hats. These hats are being sold.
[37:35.490 --> 37:38.830]  The bottom right one has a yellow thread that's barely attached.
[37:39.550 --> 37:41.690]  They're beautiful. Oh, my God, it does.
[37:42.430 --> 37:46.810]  What's wrong with their machine? Okay, hold on. It's on the instructions to their machine.
[37:47.170 --> 37:54.130]  The machine is even listed. It's an EM-1010 home embroidery machine. We could buy our own.
[37:54.350 --> 37:57.690]  This isn't a business you've gone to, surely. It's just some bloke with an embroidery.
[37:57.950 --> 38:02.490]  No, it's a $10,000 machine. I think we need this specific machine
[38:02.490 --> 38:07.670]  because I think it's possessed by some sort of a hilarious f*** face demon.
[38:07.910 --> 38:10.550]  I bet we couldn't achieve these results on any other machine on Earth.
[38:10.750 --> 38:11.430]  It would be tough.
[38:11.510 --> 38:14.550]  My recommendation would be to throw those hats away and start over again with red.
[38:14.710 --> 38:19.930]  Well, go fuck yourself, first of all. Second of all, we can't. It's with devastating news.
[38:20.090 --> 38:22.370]  I have to say that the machine was fixed today.
[38:22.610 --> 38:23.610]  Oh, no.
[38:24.330 --> 38:27.070]  The machine was repaired and the 20 hats didn't even get made.
[38:27.350 --> 38:31.310]  I think we ended up with 14. So this is a very collectible item. 14 black hats.
[38:31.310 --> 38:35.510]  So we have in total, sum total, do we have 14 black hats?
[38:35.690 --> 38:36.470]  I believe so, yes.
[38:36.610 --> 38:38.530]  In existence. How many white hats exist?
[38:38.670 --> 38:38.850]  One.
[38:38.990 --> 38:40.010]  How many red hats exist?
[38:40.310 --> 38:40.630]  One.
[38:41.050 --> 38:42.230]  Those are the collectibles, my friend.
[38:43.110 --> 38:44.630]  Yeah, I mean, technically, you're right.
[38:44.770 --> 38:47.750]  We need to preserve that red and that white hat,
[38:47.830 --> 38:50.150]  and I guess one of those shitty black hats that nobody likes,
[38:50.330 --> 38:52.190]  for the someday the f*** face museum.
[38:52.490 --> 38:56.510]  You know, like when, like, I assume probably in maybe Austin,
[38:56.730 --> 38:59.610]  but maybe maybe in like a bigger city like LA or New York,
[38:59.610 --> 39:00.450]  they'll have like, you know,
[39:00.730 --> 39:05.450]  the f*** face exhibit at like the Museum of Modern Art or like MoMA or,
[39:05.630 --> 39:07.110]  or maybe the Museum of Natural History,
[39:07.270 --> 39:10.770]  because this podcast will be so historically relevant at some point.
[39:10.870 --> 39:12.270]  I got another phone call. That's cool.
[39:12.650 --> 39:13.890]  That's like seven now.
[39:14.250 --> 39:18.590]  That I assume that we'll want to be able to put these three hats in behind the glass
[39:18.590 --> 39:19.990]  so people can look at them forever.
[39:20.230 --> 39:23.990]  Or we could sell the hats that everyone loved two weeks ago that are suddenly garbage.
[39:24.250 --> 39:25.270]  Or we could do that.
[39:25.770 --> 39:28.530]  That's also, maybe we don't f***ing make a pant line
[39:28.530 --> 39:29.610]  and then put it in a museum.
[39:29.870 --> 39:32.810]  That's not a good look. That's a bad look for the opening line.
[39:33.070 --> 39:35.390]  Now it's a product. Let's not, let's put it in a museum.
[39:36.210 --> 39:38.770]  Museums are like revered objects.
[39:39.070 --> 39:41.710]  You could just make anything a museum. I don't think that's true.
[39:41.810 --> 39:42.870]  It doesn't make it revered.
[39:43.370 --> 39:44.530]  I think it does.
[39:44.710 --> 39:45.530]  I don't think it does.
[39:45.750 --> 39:48.250]  If I bought a building and called it a museum
[39:48.250 --> 39:50.850]  and then put a bunch of f***ing Dr. Pepper bottles in it.
[39:51.070 --> 39:52.250]  That's not revered.
[39:52.270 --> 39:52.790]  Hey, Gavin.
[39:53.030 --> 39:53.210]  Yeah.
[39:53.330 --> 39:57.050]  Do you remember the time that you and I went to Berlin, Germany together?
[39:57.050 --> 39:59.690]  It wasn't just us. It was a whole crew of us, about five of us.
[40:00.050 --> 40:03.530]  And while we were there, we went to a place called the Video Game Museum.
[40:03.870 --> 40:07.970]  And it was a very professional, high-class establishment, right?
[40:07.990 --> 40:11.610]  It was like a legitimate museum with all kinds of old video game consoles
[40:11.610 --> 40:17.570]  and historically important artifacts and things from the world of video games, right?
[40:17.690 --> 40:18.370]  Quick question, Geoff.
[40:18.410 --> 40:23.710]  Are you about to make the comparison that you yourself are a revered object?
[40:23.710 --> 40:26.710]  Well, I was just going to say, having appeared...
[40:26.710 --> 40:31.210]  Obviously, our cartoon Red vs. Blue was prominently featured, permanently,
[40:31.730 --> 40:32.750]  permanent exhibit in the...
[40:33.710 --> 40:34.890]  By the way, I have no idea if that's true.
[40:35.250 --> 40:37.730]  But it was in a TV and a wall, so I figured that's pretty permanent.
[40:39.230 --> 40:42.970]  That Red vs. Blue, like episode one and two of Red vs. Blue were showed there on a loop.
[40:43.150 --> 40:46.950]  I stood next to that and Gavin looked at me and I'll never...
[40:46.950 --> 40:48.850]  I'll remember it till the day I die.
[40:49.110 --> 40:51.750]  He looked at me and he said, you, sir, are revered.
[40:52.930 --> 40:54.470]  And then I bowed to him.
[40:54.530 --> 40:54.730]  Yeah.
[40:54.870 --> 40:57.110]  So I think maybe it would be revered, Andrew.
[40:57.370 --> 41:00.650]  I feel like that was a long story that had no point to my point.
[41:00.730 --> 41:02.090]  You're just talking about revered things.
[41:02.830 --> 41:06.930]  I'm saying you should feel revered if your hat makes it in a museum.
[41:07.210 --> 41:09.610]  How about the ultimate compromise, Andrew?
[41:09.930 --> 41:13.190]  That the red version is the shirt, the black version is the hat.
[41:13.290 --> 41:13.950]  I'm fine with that.
[41:14.090 --> 41:14.530]  I don't...
[41:14.530 --> 41:16.350]  The hat or the shirt can be whatever color.
[41:16.530 --> 41:17.770]  I can't change the hat color.
[41:18.030 --> 41:19.230]  Shirt can be whatever it wants to be.
[41:19.350 --> 41:21.550]  You're making it sound like you ordered 20,000 hats.
[41:21.550 --> 41:22.290]  20 hats?
[41:22.410 --> 41:24.270]  I went out of pocket. It wasn't cheap.
[41:24.470 --> 41:25.710]  Nobody asked you to.
[41:25.830 --> 41:27.990]  I paid for 20 hats. Takes money to make them.
[41:28.690 --> 41:30.050]  Nobody told you to do that.
[41:30.110 --> 41:34.130]  No, but I fucking... we don't tell each other our bids before the thing.
[41:34.330 --> 41:37.830]  Okay, Eric is saying we have a store. Why would you make your own?
[41:38.010 --> 41:40.090]  Eric, you just said you can't make them.
[41:40.390 --> 41:40.870]  Make the hat.
[41:40.970 --> 41:43.490]  What do you mean? Why don't you guys make your own? You can't.
[41:43.590 --> 41:44.270]  Eric, get in here.
[41:44.610 --> 41:46.790]  What I said is that they were flummoxed.
[41:46.810 --> 41:49.910]  They were shocked by what the hat was and what happened.
[41:49.910 --> 41:53.970]  I didn't say they couldn't make it. I said that they were shocked by that.
[41:54.250 --> 41:57.890]  Why not tell the fucking guy that's making the hats? Why tell the other two?
[41:58.290 --> 42:02.070]  Well, I made a pact. I try not to talk to you guys during the week
[42:02.070 --> 42:04.550]  because I don't want to ruin the show, so...
[42:04.550 --> 42:09.270]  But you talk to 75% of the show. That's not a good excuse. You talk to two-thirds.
[42:09.650 --> 42:15.190]  If I could say, selfishly, I don't want to be the guy who's making a red hat with white text on it,
[42:15.410 --> 42:18.410]  but if it's a black hat with white text, I can see if I can push it through.
[42:18.410 --> 42:20.510]  Yeah, we already have the hats.
[42:20.790 --> 42:25.090]  But isn't it funnier to us, Eric, that you are the person who has to push through a red hat?
[42:25.150 --> 42:26.410]  No, it's not.
[42:26.570 --> 42:28.870]  I want the hats sold. The hats are funny enough.
[42:28.990 --> 42:30.950]  I don't understand this whole situation.
[42:31.210 --> 42:35.810]  Andrew is presenting himself as if he is the man who has to make these hats.
[42:35.990 --> 42:38.150]  Right, he's some sort of a victim in this process.
[42:38.390 --> 42:39.710]  Like, he was doing...
[42:39.710 --> 42:41.990]  Name another person who has made that fucking hat.
[42:42.270 --> 42:43.350]  Nobody made...
[42:43.350 --> 42:45.450]  But nobody said, Andrew, make these hats.
[42:45.450 --> 42:48.270]  Yeah, but you did say the store can make this hat.
[42:48.510 --> 42:50.010]  Why did they make a shirt?
[42:50.310 --> 42:53.050]  The shirt seemed like it was like, hey, we can't do the hat, but look at this shirt.
[42:53.270 --> 42:54.010]  It's a hat shirt.
[42:54.210 --> 42:55.230]  Yeah, it's a fucking...
[42:55.230 --> 42:56.510]  It's a Russian fuckface hat...
[42:56.510 --> 42:58.230]  Fuck hat shirt, which is funny to say.
[42:58.330 --> 42:59.650]  And also, look at the feedback.
[43:00.070 --> 43:02.450]  We'd feel like assholes if we didn't have any other hats.
[43:02.690 --> 43:03.550]  Just had that one hat.
[43:03.850 --> 43:04.670]  People love that hat.
[43:04.810 --> 43:05.870]  So you made 13?
[43:06.190 --> 43:07.390]  I'm... Well, I tried to make 20.
[43:07.690 --> 43:10.390]  Eric, sometimes dreams are dreams and you can't achieve them.
[43:10.750 --> 43:12.050]  But, you know, we made... We tried.
[43:12.170 --> 43:15.050]  Are you still gonna make the other six or whatever?
[43:15.050 --> 43:16.970]  That math took way too long.
[43:17.090 --> 43:17.950]  And you got it wrong.
[43:18.230 --> 43:20.070]  No, because he made 14 hats.
[43:20.170 --> 43:20.870]  No, he said 13.
[43:20.890 --> 43:22.170]  I'm not... I'm not exactly sure.
[43:22.210 --> 43:23.390]  It's somewhere in that range.
[43:23.590 --> 43:25.630]  I think I have six hats left.
[43:25.790 --> 43:27.930]  Also, Eric, is it your position?
[43:28.490 --> 43:31.210]  And I want to make sure I'm not reading into this too much,
[43:31.350 --> 43:33.190]  but I think I'm... I think what I'm hearing...
[43:33.190 --> 43:35.450]  I think I'm hearing literally this from you.
[43:35.630 --> 43:40.890]  You're saying that red hats are the 2020 equivalent of Hitler's mustache.
[43:41.250 --> 43:41.450]  Yeah.
[43:41.510 --> 43:44.650]  Like they are now out of style forever and they're ruined.
[43:44.650 --> 43:47.710]  The rest of my lifetime, I'll never be able to wear a red hat.
[43:47.770 --> 43:49.970]  No, it's not a forever thing. It's a right now thing.
[43:50.150 --> 43:52.150]  Call me in 2025 and we can talk about it.
[43:52.230 --> 43:56.410]  So what if you can pre-order the red hat, but it doesn't ship till 2024?
[43:56.970 --> 43:57.750]  That's an idea.
[43:57.870 --> 43:58.590]  Now we're thinking.
[43:58.710 --> 44:01.030]  As long as we sell the black hats, I don't give a shit.
[44:01.170 --> 44:01.310]  Whatever.
[44:02.410 --> 44:03.670]  We're selling the black hats.
[44:03.770 --> 44:05.710]  Okay, wait, but you keep saying the black hats.
[44:05.850 --> 44:08.010]  Do you mean the 14 black hats you made?
[44:08.310 --> 44:09.950]  Yes, absolutely, I do.
[44:09.950 --> 44:13.390]  I don't understand how you think that you making the hats,
[44:13.530 --> 44:15.510]  how we as a company are going to sell them.
[44:15.570 --> 44:17.330]  Ah, we just, we ship them to the store.
[44:17.410 --> 44:19.410]  You put the thing on the site, you sell the hats.
[44:19.530 --> 44:23.050]  Are you expected to be paid by Rooster Teeth for your hat printing?
[44:23.310 --> 44:26.190]  I think I'm going to make bootleg merch for the own show that I'm on.
[44:26.290 --> 44:29.310]  The show that I'm on, I'm going to make and sell my own merch.
[44:29.750 --> 44:31.290]  Apparently this whole system's fucked.
[44:31.850 --> 44:34.110]  I believed in the system. That's where I went wrong.
[44:34.170 --> 44:35.010]  Can I ask a question?
[44:35.170 --> 44:35.590]  Yeah, go ahead.
[44:35.730 --> 44:39.490]  Did you think going in that this black hat was going to be a big win
[44:39.490 --> 44:42.190]  and you were going to save the day and you were going to be like Andrew the Hero?
[44:42.750 --> 44:44.990]  No, I thought it was a really stupid thing that'd be funny.
[44:45.150 --> 44:47.230]  Little bet you did. I bet you thought like,
[44:47.350 --> 44:52.470]  this is a classic Andrew misdirection from the whole piss fetish thing.
[44:52.790 --> 44:54.070]  They'll forget all about that.
[44:54.110 --> 44:55.130]  Well, you already forgot about that.
[44:55.230 --> 44:57.970]  I love how busy Andrew is between weeks.
[44:58.410 --> 45:01.590]  We had none of this like two weeks ago. You're so busy.
[45:01.790 --> 45:02.990]  I'm trying to make fucking content.
[45:03.210 --> 45:05.030]  You make stuff happen. I love it.
[45:05.110 --> 45:05.710]  We got hats.
[45:05.710 --> 45:08.810]  I do think, Andrew, that you sadly will have nothing to do
[45:08.810 --> 45:11.270]  with the actual merch that we end up selling.
[45:11.550 --> 45:13.810]  We can't do anything with the 14 hats.
[45:14.050 --> 45:16.410]  And I think that's what Eric is... I think that's their point.
[45:17.370 --> 45:21.590]  That's a problem for the higher ups, the bigwigs to deal with.
[45:21.670 --> 45:22.490]  I don't understand.
[45:22.810 --> 45:26.250]  We're just the talented kids in the weeds. We don't need to worry about that.
[45:26.410 --> 45:28.730]  What I do think, though, is that we should come up with something really
[45:28.730 --> 45:31.650]  fucking cool to do with those 13 or 14 hats.
[45:31.810 --> 45:32.530]  Like sell them.
[45:32.710 --> 45:34.910]  Like count them and find out how many there are.
[45:36.330 --> 45:37.570]  Sell them's pretty cool.
[45:37.850 --> 45:40.990]  What about just give them to 13 people in the Discord that you make?
[45:41.150 --> 45:41.790]  I already said that.
[45:42.010 --> 45:43.750]  Why don't you make 13 hats to give it to them?
[45:43.810 --> 45:44.710]  I don't want to make... I don't know.
[45:44.730 --> 45:46.710]  I wouldn't even know where to start making 13 hats.
[45:47.410 --> 45:49.530]  How about we sell each hat?
[45:49.710 --> 45:51.670]  You, I say you. I'm trying to help you out here.
[45:51.770 --> 45:54.870]  You sell each hat for $100,000 each.
[45:55.050 --> 45:57.510]  No, that's ridiculous. $1,000 each.
[45:57.730 --> 46:01.190]  And then you'll be loaded. You'll have 13 or 14 grand.
[46:01.370 --> 46:04.450]  You're laughing now, but if I can sell those hats for $1,000 each.
[46:04.730 --> 46:05.430]  Egg on your face.
[46:05.430 --> 46:07.990]  Then you get an email from the legal department saying,
[46:08.370 --> 46:10.750]  hey, you're selling our IP that you made.
[46:10.830 --> 46:11.870]  What do you mean their IP?
[46:12.290 --> 46:13.130]  Alright, your IP.
[46:14.670 --> 46:16.590]  Oh, it's just a mess, isn't it?
[46:16.610 --> 46:17.470]  It's a complete mess.
[46:17.650 --> 46:18.330]  Yeah, I love it.
[46:18.410 --> 46:21.470]  I love that we faced ourselves right out the gate with the merch.
[46:21.670 --> 46:22.930]  I can't believe you went red.
[46:23.030 --> 46:24.370]  Both of you suddenly went red.
[46:24.490 --> 46:25.570]  I did not see that coming.
[46:25.670 --> 46:29.110]  I will agree to back down on it having to be red.
[46:29.390 --> 46:30.470]  We'll do it as a pre-order.
[46:30.630 --> 46:31.190]  It'll be fine.
[46:31.390 --> 46:34.150]  However, we do have to start selling a hat.
[46:35.030 --> 46:37.090]  Otherwise, it will be a bootleg item.
[46:37.470 --> 46:38.310]  Well, we have to.
[46:38.370 --> 46:39.010]  And maybe it's these.
[46:39.130 --> 46:39.470]  I don't know.
[46:39.590 --> 46:42.570]  Maybe we can bundle them up and ship them over to RT.
[46:42.950 --> 46:46.770]  Is the fuck hat shirt getting made or is that just a concept?
[46:47.030 --> 46:47.790]  It should, though.
[46:47.950 --> 46:49.210]  It absolutely needs to get made.
[46:49.230 --> 46:49.390]  Yeah.
[46:49.610 --> 46:50.410]  You want it to get made?
[46:50.450 --> 46:51.170]  I can tell them right now.
[46:51.310 --> 46:52.490]  Yeah, we want it to get made.
[46:52.590 --> 46:52.850]  Of course.
[46:53.030 --> 46:54.430]  And then we need to get the fuck hats made.
[46:54.530 --> 46:56.170]  But let's see how the fuck hat shirt does.
[46:56.310 --> 47:03.170]  We can sell the hat shirt and we'll just pick 13 random orders and we'll include the busted up hat.
[47:03.170 --> 47:05.490]  We don't have the fucking hats.
[47:05.610 --> 47:07.130]  They're at Andrew's or whatever.
[47:07.530 --> 47:08.310]  Andrew can ship them.
[47:08.450 --> 47:08.930]  They're in Kansas.
[47:09.070 --> 47:13.390]  And I'm also, once again, I'm not fan of any of the plans where I end up with zero dollars on these hats.
[47:14.250 --> 47:15.810]  Oh, this will be here's what you do.
[47:15.890 --> 47:17.030]  Get the hats, Andrew.
[47:17.370 --> 47:17.610]  Okay.
[47:17.750 --> 47:22.870]  And then put them in, put them in the four saves and then mail them, mail them to the store.
[47:23.070 --> 47:24.030]  How much were the hats, Andrew?
[47:24.290 --> 47:26.450]  I spent around $300 on everything.
[47:26.990 --> 47:28.230]  On 14 hats?
[47:28.430 --> 47:28.850]  Well, 20.
[47:28.930 --> 47:31.770]  I bought 20 hats and then you have to use the machine and services.
[47:31.770 --> 47:33.470]  You didn't get 20 hats.
[47:33.750 --> 47:34.950]  No. Well, okay.
[47:35.110 --> 47:35.750]  Here's the thing.
[47:35.790 --> 47:37.190]  I can't believe they charged you for that.
[47:37.270 --> 47:37.850]  Here's the thing.
[47:38.110 --> 47:41.190]  They were trying to fix the machine on and off and I kept having it pushed off.
[47:41.610 --> 47:46.390]  And while the person was making the final hats today, the guy stopped him and said,
[47:46.450 --> 47:47.610]  I think I can fix this.
[47:47.690 --> 47:49.870]  And he fixed the machine with six hats left.
[47:50.090 --> 47:55.010]  So where we have left off is that person is trying to duplicate a fucked up design,
[47:55.370 --> 47:59.010]  like trying to create that as a graphic and then applying that to the hat.
[47:59.330 --> 48:00.410]  See if it's possible.
[48:00.410 --> 48:01.730]  That'll just be a graphic.
[48:01.910 --> 48:05.650]  Then the beauty of these hats is that each one is, like I said, like a fingerprint.
[48:05.930 --> 48:06.430]  It's unique.
[48:06.550 --> 48:08.170]  The government will be able to track you.
[48:08.450 --> 48:09.450]  I don't know what I did to you.
[48:09.590 --> 48:10.230]  I love you.
[48:10.330 --> 48:12.510]  I love the initiative you took.
[48:12.890 --> 48:14.190]  It's why I'm trying to support you.
[48:14.270 --> 48:17.510]  I'm trying to support the integrity of F*** Face as an entity by sticking with
[48:17.510 --> 48:20.550]  the spirit of F*** Facing by keeping it red.
[48:20.670 --> 48:21.650]  I just got another call.
[48:21.930 --> 48:22.050]  Huh.
[48:22.170 --> 48:25.430]  We've got a whole episode about a hat from last week's episode.
[48:25.930 --> 48:26.170]  Yeah.
[48:27.170 --> 48:28.910]  That's why I fucking made the hats.
[48:28.910 --> 48:31.390]  What would this episode be without my hat making?
[48:31.590 --> 48:32.290]  A lot more calm.
[48:32.530 --> 48:32.910]  That's true.
[48:32.950 --> 48:33.730]  I did a lot of yelling.
[48:33.910 --> 48:35.170]  I do feel bad about that.
[48:35.230 --> 48:38.750]  I've got nine fucking calls since we started recording.
[48:38.930 --> 48:42.710]  What I can't say is I do not feel at all bad about calling you nine fucking times.
[48:42.890 --> 48:45.390]  That doesn't upset me in the slightest.
[48:45.970 --> 48:50.750]  At first, I felt a little bit bad, but then when you went red, I hammered those calls.
[48:50.950 --> 48:51.370]  Did you?
[48:51.550 --> 48:51.990]  Is that you?
[48:51.990 --> 48:52.290]  Oh, yeah.
[48:52.530 --> 48:52.970]  Oh, yeah.
[48:53.410 --> 48:53.810]  Absolutely.
[48:54.030 --> 48:54.190]  It was me.
[48:54.190 --> 48:55.350]  That makes me so glad.
[48:55.570 --> 48:56.190]  I gotta hold on a second.
[48:56.250 --> 48:58.550]  I gotta get my left hand in position to turn this key.
[48:58.550 --> 48:59.950]  Are you being serious now?
[49:00.050 --> 49:00.690]  Was that actually you?
[49:00.750 --> 49:00.930]  Yeah.
[49:01.110 --> 49:01.870]  Here, do you want me to call you?
[49:01.930 --> 49:02.690]  I can call you too.
[49:03.050 --> 49:05.250]  Left hand turn, right hand turn, nuclear football.
[49:05.330 --> 49:06.330]  Okay, let me call Gavin.
[49:06.710 --> 49:07.250]  I'm in California.
[49:07.510 --> 49:08.810]  You are calling me from LA.
[49:09.190 --> 49:10.170]  How is he doing that?
[49:10.370 --> 49:10.570]  Yeah.
[49:10.730 --> 49:12.090]  You were doing that this whole time?
[49:12.310 --> 49:13.290]  Yeah, I was just calling him.
[49:13.330 --> 49:14.650]  Once he went red, I was like, fuck him.
[49:14.890 --> 49:15.990]  I'm just gonna call him constantly.
[49:16.530 --> 49:17.230]  What's up, Gavin?
[49:17.430 --> 49:17.910]  How's it going?
[49:18.490 --> 49:19.270]  It is you!
[49:19.390 --> 49:20.030]  Yeah, what's up?
[49:20.130 --> 49:20.870]  This is awful.
[49:21.170 --> 49:23.110]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with you.
[49:23.250 --> 49:23.550]  I don't know.
[49:23.590 --> 49:24.150]  How about this, though?
[49:24.150 --> 49:29.330]  You leave your f*** face microphone, take a step back,
[49:29.630 --> 49:32.010]  and deliver the entire outro through my phone.
[49:32.190 --> 49:32.430]  Okay.
[49:32.570 --> 49:36.030]  Well, no, I can't do that because I'm using my microphone for the phone.
[49:36.370 --> 49:37.470]  Oh, it's the same mic?
[49:37.490 --> 49:38.530]  I probably shouldn't have called you.
[49:38.730 --> 49:40.350]  Yeah, I'm recording a podcast right now.
[49:40.610 --> 49:44.410]  We'll just mute your track and play just my track of you.
[49:44.410 --> 49:44.530]  Okay.
[49:44.870 --> 49:45.890]  Take it away, Andrew!
[49:46.290 --> 49:46.870]  What am I doing?
[49:47.030 --> 49:52.340]  Sorry, I'm doing the outro.
[49:53.520 --> 49:54.600]  I'm ending the episode.
[49:54.600 --> 49:55.800]  Eric wants me to end the episode.
[49:56.420 --> 50:01.280]  This is California Krampus, aka Pissboy, aka Andrew.
[50:01.540 --> 50:06.220]  Thank you for listening to this monstrosity of a podcast where we argued about hats
[50:06.220 --> 50:09.440]  and learned that Geoff loves mega red more than any other color.
[50:09.960 --> 50:12.120]  Please rate it five stars and subscribe.
[50:12.400 --> 50:14.600]  Maybe DM the podcast to a thousand people.
[50:14.840 --> 50:16.400]  Maybe do that if you feel like it.
[50:16.580 --> 50:17.240]  We'd appreciate it.
[50:17.360 --> 50:17.980]  Maybe not a thousand.
[50:18.060 --> 50:18.820]  You'll end up in Twitter jail.
[50:19.100 --> 50:19.600]  Thank you for listening.
[50:19.700 --> 50:20.380]  That was perfect.
[50:20.640 --> 50:21.220]  That was really good.
[50:21.400 --> 50:25.120]  I like your idea of putting people in Twitter jail by supporting the show.
[50:25.120 --> 50:28.200]  I think that's a great way for our audience to f*** face themselves.
[50:28.580 --> 50:29.260]  Get in on the action.
[50:29.580 --> 50:29.980]  Or don't.
[50:30.040 --> 50:31.280]  Don't do that if that's a bad thing.
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.140]  Is the show over?
[50:32.180 --> 50:33.260]  I feel like we ended the show.
[50:33.340 --> 50:33.620]  I don't know.
[50:33.760 --> 50:34.360]  Are we still...
[50:34.360 --> 50:38.620]  Geoff did that thing again where he took your wonderful outro and just undid it.
[50:38.740 --> 50:39.520]  Geoff hates me today.
[50:39.600 --> 50:40.440]  I don't know what I did to him.
[50:40.460 --> 50:41.160]  I love you!
[50:41.260 --> 50:41.960]  What do you mean I hate you today?
[50:42.060 --> 50:43.160]  I wanted to talk to you.
[50:43.360 --> 50:44.940]  I'm going to talk to you next episode about it.
[50:45.020 --> 50:45.220]  Okay.
[50:45.460 --> 50:47.620]  I'll tell you why I have a California phone number next episode.
[50:47.700 --> 50:49.000]  I can't wait to find out.
[50:49.220 --> 50:50.260]  All right.
[50:50.480 --> 50:51.600]  I mean, we already ended the show.
[50:51.700 --> 50:52.060]  What are we doing?
[50:52.400 --> 50:53.260]  Are we still talking?
[50:53.260 --> 50:55.500]  I'm going to hit stop on recording and then we really are done.
[50:55.840 --> 50:56.320]  Stop it!
