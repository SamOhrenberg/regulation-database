[00:40.110 --> 00:46.990]  Oh, it's me Gavin with piss-point grill master face 11 or 12. I think it's 13. It's way too
[00:46.990 --> 00:51.350]  high. What is it? Shit. Too much? I mean, it was a little too much, but what number are we on? I
[00:51.350 --> 00:56.870]  think it's 13. Wow, I was way off. I certainly named it number 13, so if it's not, my naming
[00:56.870 --> 01:01.830]  scheme is off. Oh, okay. Well, apologies for that. Oh, no, it was good. Yeah, Nick says it's 13 for
[01:01.830 --> 01:07.570]  sure. Eric concurs it's 13. This is 13, he says. Sounds like it's 13. Well, you already started
[01:07.570 --> 01:11.150]  off. I was going to start it off like this, but I loved your entrance. You had a lot of enthusiasm.
[01:11.510 --> 01:15.490]  You came in hot. I really appreciated it. We'll do different takes. Well, let's do Geoff. Here's
[01:15.490 --> 01:20.550]  how I was going to do it. All right. Action. Hello, and welcome to another episode of F*** Face. My
[01:20.550 --> 01:26.130]  name is Geoff Ramsey, and this is a podcast where you, let's say, make an appointment to go to the
[01:26.130 --> 01:32.510]  dentist on the day that you record a podcast. And you make that appointment because it's an
[01:32.510 --> 01:36.950]  emergency, because you've had a week of a terrible, terrible, terrible toothache,
[01:37.070 --> 01:42.650]  and it's keeping you up at night, and you haven't slept for three or four days now. And so the
[01:42.650 --> 01:47.450]  first slot you can get in is at 830 in the morning on the day that you record episode 13 of your
[01:47.450 --> 01:53.350]  podcast. So you go just for some sweet relief, just anything, and you find out that you need,
[01:53.410 --> 01:59.130]  and then you receive a root canal. As with me, as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Benton.
[01:59.130 --> 02:06.330]  You had a rough day. Oh my god, I'm miserable. It feels like two women crawled inside of my mouth
[02:06.330 --> 02:11.310]  for two hours with sharp metal objects, and they were very sweet, and they were very nice,
[02:11.330 --> 02:16.190]  and they numbed me up real good. But as the numbing is wearing off, I feel like hammered
[02:16.190 --> 02:21.190]  shit. I feel like somebody used my face as a piñata, and I'm all drugged up, and I'm so
[02:21.190 --> 02:25.630]  ready to do this podcast. So Andrew, what's it do with you? What exactly is the root canal?
[02:26.230 --> 02:30.810]  It's like your tooth stem. It's like deep, deep tooth, right? Yeah, it's like...
[02:31.790 --> 02:35.530]  Or is it the tooth or the hole for the tooth? I don't fucking know, dude. I'll tell you what it
[02:35.530 --> 02:40.750]  is. It's about 90 minutes of a jackhammer going into your brain, and hearing them go like,
[02:40.830 --> 02:46.850]  I almost got it. You're like, oh my god. You're hearing cranking and gears. It sounds like,
[02:46.950 --> 02:53.030]  if you close your eyes, it almost sounds like an engine overhaul on like a 77 Bronco.
[02:54.370 --> 02:59.230]  And we all know what that sounds like. Yeah, very relatable reference. A lot of pneumatic drills,
[02:59.470 --> 03:04.870]  and whirs, and zings, and clangs. A lot of clangs. They didn't adequately numb you. No,
[03:04.950 --> 03:10.630]  they did a good job. It's just that when two entire human beings crawl into your mouth,
[03:10.730 --> 03:14.750]  you get all stretched out. I mean, they're not in there on their hands and knees, Geoff. Dude,
[03:14.870 --> 03:22.030]  Gavin, it was my molar, my back tooth. So they had to get me, they had to get, they're not large
[03:22.030 --> 03:26.550]  women, but they had to get all of their hands, and their arms, and they're up at least to the
[03:26.550 --> 03:31.890]  biceps. Well, I mean, compared to the human mouth, all women are large. That's four entire limbs in
[03:31.890 --> 03:36.590]  there. And then they had to get the drilling rig, you know, the equipment. They had to get the
[03:36.590 --> 03:42.450]  front loader, and like the raker, and all that stuff. They had to jack you up. Yeah, and then
[03:42.450 --> 03:48.530]  those things require power, so they have to pull that giant battery machine. The three-phase. Yeah,
[03:48.530 --> 03:53.250]  and then you got to have a tech, for if the generator fails, and he's got to have a place
[03:53.250 --> 03:57.950]  to stand. And then, you know, all the bits and pieces of your tooth that are flying out, they
[03:57.950 --> 04:05.690]  got to go somewhere. Anyway, it takes up a lot of space. I feel like I just did a 500 dick gangbang
[04:05.690 --> 04:11.550]  in my butt. You didn't even go for mouth, the source of the pain. I mean, my butt feels like
[04:11.550 --> 04:16.410]  my mouth. My mouth feels like... Wait, what? My mouth feels like what my butthole would feel like
[04:16.410 --> 04:22.250]  if I had gotten gangbanged by 500 dudes of decent length and girth. So you're saying,
[04:22.490 --> 04:27.710]  if you took 500 dudes in the mouth, it wouldn't be as bad. Yeah, and I realize that maybe I'm not
[04:27.710 --> 04:30.810]  making the most logical sense, but that's because I'm on some pills of some kind,
[04:30.930 --> 04:33.990]  and I'm a little loopy. What with the pain and all! Oh, I shouldn't yell.
[04:35.530 --> 04:40.250]  Is this a different tooth, Geoff, than the one that you sucked in half with a piece of taffy?
[04:40.450 --> 04:45.990]  What? Different tooth. Same tooth, other side of the mouth. Yeah, he was just sucking on some
[04:45.990 --> 04:50.890]  saltwater taffy, which I assume was delicious. It was delicious. He was just sucking on it,
[04:50.970 --> 04:55.450]  we're playing like Gears of War 2 or something, and suddenly he just like crunched something.
[04:55.610 --> 05:01.070]  It was like he bit like a pistachio shell or something. It was like... And then he gauzed out
[05:01.070 --> 05:05.970]  like just the top half of his tooth. Just like shaved off. Yeah, just like pulled in half by
[05:05.970 --> 05:12.490]  taffy. That's horrifying. Was it painful? It didn't feel great. You seem more confused than in pain,
[05:12.490 --> 05:17.950]  but... It didn't feel as bad as this. Anyway, that's what kind of podcast this is. Uh, Andrew,
[05:18.310 --> 05:23.690]  uh, did you vertically wipe your way to 50 hamburgers? Oh, are we going vertical wipe
[05:23.690 --> 05:27.510]  off the jump? I think we should tie up the loose threads. Should we put some backstory on the
[05:27.510 --> 05:31.330]  vertical wipe? I might as well just read the email exchange, right? Yeah, I feel like that's probably
[05:31.330 --> 05:35.910]  necessary. I'm glad we're finally getting to this. Eric says in an email to all three of us,
[05:36.250 --> 05:41.510]  hey guys, got this message from sales. Someone wants to send a bidet. I just need an address
[05:41.510 --> 05:46.610]  and pics of their toilet. Any takers? Geoff, I assume already having one, says someone should
[05:46.610 --> 05:52.670]  take it. Andrew said, I already said this once, but I forgot to tag everyone. As a vertical wiper,
[05:52.850 --> 05:58.690]  I'm out. A bidet would add a layer of risk to my wipes that I cannot take. It's a risky game.
[05:59.190 --> 06:03.930]  As you might imagine, that sort of steered the email chain in a slightly different direction
[06:03.930 --> 06:09.510]  to how it started with us all wondering what the hell is a vertical wiper? And then Eric comes
[06:09.510 --> 06:13.930]  flying in, save it for the show. And that was the end. Oh, and then, and then I think he took
[06:13.930 --> 06:19.810]  the bidet. I feel like it's pretty self-explanatory. I've wiped vertically. I don't trust the toilet
[06:19.810 --> 06:25.070]  situation. You wipe vertically. I mean, it doesn't, if, if your ass cheeks make a vertical
[06:25.070 --> 06:29.970]  trench in your ass, doesn't every, who is going to go cheek to cheek when you could just go down?
[06:30.570 --> 06:36.250]  The only way to wipe horizontally would be if you laid down on your side on the ground and got in
[06:36.250 --> 06:42.070]  the fetal position. And then, then it would be a horizontal wipe. Are you shit wiping in the
[06:42.070 --> 06:48.290]  fetal position? No. Is this a piss boy thing? One leg bent just to get it stretched. What I'm saying
[06:48.290 --> 06:53.770]  is most people, I would say wipe in the prone position. You're very vulnerable on a toilet.
[06:53.930 --> 06:58.350]  The wiping position. Wipe in prone? Yeah, well, when you're sitting on it. Like if I'm crawling
[06:58.350 --> 07:04.270]  through like low brush? Not literally prone, but I'm saying in comparison to what I do,
[07:04.270 --> 07:10.410]  which is the vertical wipe. I do my business. I stand up. Then I do the wipe. Then I move on with
[07:10.410 --> 07:16.470]  my day. I don't sit for the wiping part. Sitting is still vertical, Andrew. I know, but it's not,
[07:16.650 --> 07:20.770]  I'm more vertical than you are in the vertical wipe. It's, it's, I'd say it's more straight,
[07:20.850 --> 07:25.590]  maybe. And we're more curved. Yeah, you, that was a, it was a real misnomer, that vertical thing.
[07:25.790 --> 07:32.690]  What you're saying is you're a standing wiper. Yes. Okay. That's a totally different thing. I
[07:32.690 --> 07:37.130]  know it doesn't at all. And I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. I don't know about that.
[07:37.250 --> 07:42.170]  Because I'm a, I'm 45 years old. I'm very well read. I'm very well learned. I've, I've been all
[07:42.170 --> 07:47.830]  around. I've never heard to it referred to as vertical wiping. Also, I myself used to be a
[07:47.830 --> 07:54.870]  standing wiper. And as someone who did, who practiced it daily until he was 45 or so,
[07:54.930 --> 08:01.970]  but 44, uh, I was so confused by your terminology. A standing wiper I get. And, uh, and might I say,
[08:01.970 --> 08:07.070]  Andrew, your fear of using the bidet because you're a standing wiper, uh, you will no longer
[08:07.070 --> 08:11.850]  be a standing wiper. If you get a bidet, I have, uh, seen the light as it were, uh, the golden
[08:11.850 --> 08:17.650]  light. And now I am a sitting wiper. And with the combination of the bidet and the sitting wipe,
[08:17.710 --> 08:25.370]  it's a whole new, fresh, clean, minty, angelic world. I'll be honest. I'm not sure you can get
[08:25.370 --> 08:30.530]  a hundred percent decent wipe. If you're stood up, you're like closing your cheeks over your
[08:30.530 --> 08:34.570]  asshole. No, you definitely can. You can. Yeah, absolutely. It's like trying to get something out
[08:34.570 --> 08:39.190]  of a drawer, but then you like close the drawer up to your wrist and you're just rummaging around.
[08:39.350 --> 08:45.950]  Open the drawer, wipe it clean. You can, you can do it. I'm going to defend Andrew. The drawer's
[08:45.950 --> 08:50.370]  open enough. You can do it. But I will say you will scrub your asshole like sandpaper by the
[08:50.370 --> 08:55.190]  time you're done to make sure it's totally clean. I get it. Okay. So maybe the cheeks are fine.
[08:55.190 --> 09:00.650]  My butthole is 10 years younger because eight months ago I switched to a bidet. 10 years younger.
[09:00.750 --> 09:05.650]  If you saw my butthole, you'd be like, am I looking at Geoff or am I looking at Geoff's 22-year-old
[09:05.650 --> 09:11.350]  butthole? I feel like to get the best wipe, you need to be in the same position that you pooped in.
[09:11.490 --> 09:15.250]  I mean, like when you sit down, not at all, a little, a little bit more anus comes out than
[09:15.250 --> 09:20.150]  maybe there when you're stood up and it sort of gets it primed. And that's where all the poo is.
[09:20.210 --> 09:24.390]  And that's the bit you got to clean. You're right. But if you stand back up, it goes, he's not right.
[09:24.390 --> 09:30.330]  No, no. He's right in the sense that it's ultimately a better wipe to wipe where you poop.
[09:30.430 --> 09:36.090]  He's right about that. He's not right in that it's in any way dirtier for you to stand up. Like
[09:36.510 --> 09:40.550]  I'm sure you have a method. I had a method where you, you kind of hold, you kind of stand to the
[09:40.550 --> 09:44.330]  side and hold your butt cheek in a certain way and you stay totally clean. But having done it
[09:44.330 --> 09:48.730]  both ways, I will say it was a hard transition to make, but once I made the transition, I could
[09:48.730 --> 09:54.390]  never go back to vertical wiping as Andrew so eloquently put it. I would say my issue isn't
[09:54.390 --> 09:59.590]  with the technology. I'm not saying I'm wiping in the most efficient way possible. I'm wiping in
[09:59.590 --> 10:04.630]  the safest way. There's no scenario in which I'm going to get caught off guard. What are the risks?
[10:05.410 --> 10:11.890]  Lethal weapon, bomb in the toilet. I've thoroughly searched that. There's not going to be a surprise
[10:11.890 --> 10:17.050]  bomb. Snake. Never know when a snake could just show up. That's a very scary proposition. You're
[10:17.050 --> 10:22.590]  still pooping. Sat down though. No, but I checked the first time. Then I stand up, do second check
[10:22.590 --> 10:26.770]  and we're all clear. We do a double check. You're worried about this big place while you are shitting.
[10:27.050 --> 10:34.130]  Yes. Right. No, no, no, that makes sense. You're also, you're making fun of the bomb thing. Snake,
[10:34.230 --> 10:38.270]  you never know when a snake will appear. Snakes do not care about your schedule. I think about
[10:38.270 --> 10:43.370]  the snake thing all the time, Andrew. And I will say you're right in the sense that, and Gavin,
[10:43.370 --> 10:47.870]  you got to give him this. He's right in the sense that if somebody has put the bomb in the toilet
[10:47.870 --> 10:52.410]  prior to pooping, uh, I mean, there's no way, there's no way you'd have to be, you'd have to
[10:52.410 --> 10:57.270]  be like the pink Panther to sneak the bomb in to the toilet while he's shitting. You'd have to be
[10:57.270 --> 11:02.250]  like the world's best thief. Uh, however, you do reduce the amount of time you sit on the toilet.
[11:02.370 --> 11:06.810]  So if the snake is somewhere in the pipes and it's making its way up to you, the sooner you get
[11:06.810 --> 11:10.290]  off the toilet, the better the chance are you're going to get off before the snake makes it through.
[11:10.290 --> 11:15.570]  Judging by that logic, the perfect piece of technology is a lifeguard chair that goes over
[11:15.570 --> 11:23.410]  your toilet. Yes. Yes. That was like Jackass 2 style. Like the concept. With a hole cut in it.
[11:23.490 --> 11:31.070]  I don't know why. Guys, I can't, I'm so dizzy. I can't open, I can't keep my eyes open.
[11:32.390 --> 11:36.190]  I don't know whether it's because I was getting disgusted or a piece of spit just moved,
[11:36.190 --> 11:42.030]  but I inhaled something in the middle of it and it's hurting me. But you get what I mean? Yeah.
[11:42.150 --> 11:47.790]  Yeah. Yeah. No, I understand. I don't really want a lifeguard in there with me. Also,
[11:47.890 --> 11:51.370]  my bathroom isn't big enough. That's not a lifeguard for you. It's a lifeguard.
[11:52.310 --> 11:57.010]  What? Did I misunderstand the point of the lifeguard? You misunderstood. What do you think
[11:57.010 --> 12:01.150]  I'm saying? I thought you're saying like an observational person to make sure the snake
[12:01.150 --> 12:05.450]  doesn't come. You didn't really think that's what I meant. That's, that was my interpretation. You
[12:05.450 --> 12:12.690]  needed a second set of eyes to let you know if the snake was coming up the pipe. Because that
[12:12.690 --> 12:16.770]  would make sense. But it's just, I don't have the room in my bathroom. My bathroom's relatively
[12:16.770 --> 12:21.290]  small. It doesn't, it doesn't take up any more room. It's a lifeguard chair that sits over your
[12:21.290 --> 12:27.950]  toilet with a hole in it. It's a toilet seat. Oh, I sit in the chair is your idea. Yes. Yes. It'll
[12:27.950 --> 12:32.810]  keep you off the toilet away from the bombs and the snakes. That's really risky. So you can land
[12:32.810 --> 12:38.650]  your dumps in the toilet and then you could wipe still sat down because you're not on the toilet.
[12:38.890 --> 12:43.730]  Have you seen a snake jump? They get some pretty good distance. I think the chair only adds more
[12:43.730 --> 12:48.870]  risk. I'm not a fan of the chair. Now, if you had like a second person observing, I'm more open to
[12:48.870 --> 12:53.790]  that, but I still don't want that. That's the bit you liked about the story. No, I didn't like it,
[12:53.850 --> 12:59.150]  but I'm saying I'm more open to it than the chair above the toilet. It's just a lot of work to climb
[12:59.150 --> 13:07.410]  up the chair. And then what if I miss and got out? That's not a wind going through. No, but but if
[13:07.410 --> 13:11.490]  you're dropping bombs, you want to hit your target. And even if you miss once with shit, it's a high
[13:11.490 --> 13:16.550]  stakes game. I think the standing wipe is better than the chair. I'm blown away that you think you
[13:16.550 --> 13:20.610]  could miss the ball from like three feet above it. I listen. What if he has like a tub girl
[13:20.610 --> 13:24.790]  explosion? What if he's got diarrhea? What if he had Chipotle? Oh, you're right. No, diarrhea would
[13:24.790 --> 13:28.690]  death. No, you're right. That's a good point. I didn't think about diarrhea. But in Gavin's defense,
[13:28.690 --> 13:34.250]  I think that you got two problems. If you have a lifeguard in the bathroom as a spotter, as a
[13:34.250 --> 13:38.730]  snake spotter, which I'm not totally opposed to. Plus, to be honest with you, it gives you somebody
[13:38.730 --> 13:44.310]  to talk to. But you still can't see the water. Your balls and ass are on it. But the problem is
[13:44.310 --> 13:48.630]  the visibility is going to be severely reduced. So what you're going to have to do is you're going
[13:48.630 --> 13:53.050]  to have to have a glass toilet. Yes. And a glass toilet is going to be expensive. And if it breaks,
[13:53.110 --> 13:56.890]  you're fucked. And you're going to end up with like, we've all seen glass ass. You don't want
[13:57.270 --> 14:03.370]  sit down to have diarrhea and then unintentionally, you know, swallow eight gallons of broken glass
[14:03.370 --> 14:07.730]  up your butthole. I'll be honest. I don't think glass is any less structurally sound than ceramic.
[14:08.050 --> 14:11.750]  Maybe. Yeah. Well, I don't know about that. We'll have to ask a scientist. But the other problem is
[14:11.750 --> 14:15.270]  even if you have the glass toilet and you've got a really good lifeguard who's focused and they've
[14:15.270 --> 14:19.890]  got the binoculars and it's trained on the pipe, the second they see the snake pop through the
[14:19.890 --> 14:23.990]  reaction time is I mean, it's there, man. It's like four inches away from your balls and your
[14:23.990 --> 14:28.030]  at that point, you're not going to be able to move fast enough. If you're in the lifeguard chair,
[14:28.150 --> 14:32.850]  you at least have some warning. No, I feel as though if you have a glass, first of all,
[14:32.910 --> 14:36.890]  not many glass toilets exist. The snake is going to think it's on a stealth mission. It's going to
[14:36.890 --> 14:42.850]  be going slowly. I think there's enough time from when when you would see the pipe to escape,
[14:43.030 --> 14:47.450]  especially if you're prepared. If that's the concern, it's I would look like Usain Bolt
[14:47.450 --> 14:51.630]  coming off the line if I got a snake alert. I'm on the toilet. I don't care what's going off.
[14:51.630 --> 14:56.450]  You and me both, buddy. OK, that's standing wiping. I feel like it's pretty logical.
[14:56.710 --> 15:01.570]  You've made your case. Yeah, I am a reformed standing wiper. I am a sitting wiper now,
[15:01.590 --> 15:06.390]  and I prefer it to the standing wipe. But I do not begrudge you, sir. And you've,
[15:06.390 --> 15:11.370]  I think, definitely articulated your position on the matter and defended it well.
[15:11.490 --> 15:15.650]  It's all vertical. It's all vertical. Well, yeah, but I'm more vertical. I'm more vertical
[15:15.650 --> 15:18.810]  than you. I think that's undeniable. I think that's a fact. I don't think you can dispute
[15:18.810 --> 15:22.970]  that in any way. I'm definitely more vertical than you are. Just in general? Not in general,
[15:23.090 --> 15:27.170]  but I think in that situation. But when shitting? When shitting, yeah, I think I'm in a more
[15:27.170 --> 15:32.070]  vertical position than you. I feel like that makes sense. I feel like I want my anus pointed
[15:32.070 --> 15:36.290]  down if I'm dealing with it at any point. And by standing up, it's pointing backwards.
[15:38.090 --> 15:42.250]  Now, that's just confusing. What you just said is I don't know how to process that.
[15:42.470 --> 15:47.070]  Backwards? Like, my anus needs to be horizontal. Oh, I'm getting loopy.
[15:47.070 --> 15:53.370]  Okay. No, you are a vertical wiper. Your anus is vertical. Well, no, you know, I'm not here to
[15:53.370 --> 15:56.990]  argue about shades of degrees. If you want to identify as a vertical wiper, that's fine too.
[15:57.070 --> 16:01.250]  I just, I think I'm more vertical. I think you're more right than you realized. I think I'm pretty
[16:01.250 --> 16:07.890]  accurate about this. All right. Fair play. All right. I think we got to the bottom of that.
[16:08.110 --> 16:12.490]  You know what? That's not something we do often. Good job, guys. No, we did it. It's amazing.
[16:12.730 --> 16:15.630]  There was little arguments there. There was like, he did discussion, obviously,
[16:15.630 --> 16:20.030]  but Andrew at no point said that he wanted to strangle both of us a couple of weeks ago.
[16:20.250 --> 16:24.330]  Well, that was a rational threat. I think I was pretty justified in that.
[16:24.730 --> 16:28.950]  Pan line momentum through the roof, by the way. People really excited about the possibility of
[16:28.950 --> 16:32.870]  the pan line. A lot of excitement. A lot of messages. I mean, I feel like people are more
[16:32.870 --> 16:38.110]  excited about those specific 14 hats, though. The ones that can't be replicated or sold.
[16:38.330 --> 16:42.130]  Oh, I don't know about that. We'll see. We'll see what the technology is. We'll see how things go.
[16:42.130 --> 16:46.370]  The holy grail of hats. So there was some good suggestions in the audience for maybe
[16:46.370 --> 16:50.910]  putting them as extra life incentives. No, absolutely. Yeah, I definitely I think that's
[16:50.910 --> 16:54.750]  what I want to do with all of them is somehow find a way to use them to raise some amount of
[16:54.750 --> 16:59.270]  money for charity and extra life would make sense for sure. Also, a more good feedback from the
[16:59.270 --> 17:04.390]  audience based on when the last one came out that I read. Apparently, the reason I keep almost flying
[17:04.390 --> 17:10.830]  over the handlebars of my bike is because Americans have the fricking brakes. Did you
[17:10.830 --> 17:15.610]  know that? I was wondering why when I moved to the US, I just forgot how to ride a bike.
[17:15.970 --> 17:19.970]  And every time I don't ride a bike for like two or three years, I get back on it.
[17:20.450 --> 17:24.070]  And, you know, like I said, it's like riding a bike. You're not supposed to forget.
[17:24.430 --> 17:28.730]  And I'm not forgetting. I'm remembering what it was like to ride a bike as a small child in England.
[17:29.210 --> 17:33.210]  So I'm restoring in all those settings. And every time I try and ride a bike now,
[17:33.290 --> 17:38.790]  I almost die. Why does your country insist on flipping everything? Well, the question is,
[17:38.790 --> 17:43.770]  where was the bike first met? That's the main question. Where was it first met? Made. Oh, made.
[17:44.230 --> 17:47.910]  You don't meet a fucking bike, but where was it made? I don't know. Was it the penny farthing?
[17:48.030 --> 17:51.590]  I have no idea. I don't know anything about bikes. I'm just saying that if it was made
[17:51.590 --> 17:55.750]  in Europe. But, you know, when I moved to America, you immediately notice a bunch of
[17:55.750 --> 17:59.770]  weird differences. It's like, well, that's different. But I never noticed the bike was
[17:59.770 --> 18:04.450]  flipped. I just thought I was an idiot. And I've never realized until someone pointed out. I didn't
[18:04.450 --> 18:09.370]  know that was a thing. Madness. It's like when you hop between consoles and you play a Switch
[18:09.370 --> 18:13.590]  game and your B and A are completely flipped and it messes you up. Yeah. It is very confusing.
[18:13.690 --> 18:19.810]  Are your brakes the same as in America, Andrew, on a Canadian bike? You guys are like a Britain
[18:19.810 --> 18:24.490]  Junior, right? So shouldn't you have the same backward brakes? I don't know about that,
[18:24.530 --> 18:29.130]  but the right side is the back brake, right? That correct? Which side is the back brake?
[18:29.130 --> 18:34.350]  Right. Right. Right side. Yeah. Right side. Then. Yeah. Same as America. Okay. I still I'm not
[18:34.350 --> 18:40.750]  exactly sure if you guys are fucking me or me. Wow. That is. I don't think we're doing that.
[18:41.330 --> 18:46.950]  Twitter jail will do some things to you. Should we get into that? Can we find out what? Yeah,
[18:46.990 --> 18:50.830]  let's just let's just transition to that because I don't even know what point I was going to make.
[18:51.070 --> 18:56.250]  It sounds like you didn't do anything regarding burgers. There were no burger updates. I just I
[18:56.250 --> 19:01.110]  with everything else I had going on, I didn't have it in me to do burgers this week. But I did
[19:01.110 --> 19:05.410]  get out of Twitter jail and I've been talking to a lot of people since we last spoke. I've
[19:05.410 --> 19:10.790]  had around 800 different conversations with people. So you get dissed by 200 people? No,
[19:10.890 --> 19:15.950]  those are the ones I haven't gotten back to yet. Okay. I still have like 195 more to go,
[19:16.070 --> 19:20.750]  but I've had 800 talks. They're really awesome. They kind of like ranged from all over the place.
[19:20.830 --> 19:25.950]  I had some surprisingly serious talks and then conversations that were literally people just
[19:25.950 --> 19:30.910]  sending me audio farts. So we kind of went all over the spectrum. Wow. Do you get any good ones
[19:30.910 --> 19:34.770]  that you want to play? Do you get do you get release forms for those? No, I didn't get release
[19:34.770 --> 19:39.050]  forms. Do I have competition? Is that what I'm hearing? You might have some some British
[19:39.050 --> 19:43.530]  competition, Geoff. Okay. All right. I'm sorry to inform you. I'd like to hear a dignified fart.
[19:43.730 --> 19:51.210]  Like a fart with a monocle. Yeah. A stately fart that's in some sort of twill suit.
[19:57.560 --> 20:02.620]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico. Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[20:03.140 --> 20:08.080]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[20:08.120 --> 20:13.720]  but they found something unexpected instead. It was still crisp, lively, and smooth, but it had
[20:13.720 --> 20:19.380]  nothing to do with waves. It was Pacifico, a delicious Mexican lager. It's like it was brewed
[20:19.380 --> 20:25.200]  to be discovered. Pacifico, find your own way. 21 Plus. Discover responsibly. Pacifico Clara Beer.
[20:25.260 --> 20:31.400]  Imported by Krine and Port Chicago, Illinois. Buenos Dias! Café Bustelo espresso-styled ice
[20:31.400 --> 20:35.640]  coffee is hitting refrigerators with a cold front that'll sweep through your senses.
[20:35.960 --> 20:41.280]  So keep the coffee pours long and the cold sips low. Café Bustelo está aquí.
[20:42.460 --> 20:47.740]  To you, my darling. No, to you. The roses were living the dream. More champagne for me, please.
[20:47.740 --> 20:53.700]  Until it all came crashing down. He got fired. Quiet! From the director of Meet the Parents.
[20:53.840 --> 20:58.140]  You're a failure. Women don't like that. If you need a shoulder or an inner thigh to lean on.
[20:58.540 --> 21:05.480]  On August 29th, I just want the house. We want everything. Wow. Stop. Yes, stop! And see the roses.
[21:06.100 --> 21:11.580]  These people. The Roses. Rated R. Under 17, not admitted without parent. In theaters everywhere,
[21:11.740 --> 21:17.540]  August 29th. 2020 has been a year of things happening that are completely and totally out
[21:17.540 --> 21:22.720]  of your control. But there is one and only one thing we can control in our lives,
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.840]  and that's our bush. Our sponsors at Manscaped are here to remind you,
[21:27.260 --> 21:32.680]  you got to take care of business at home first, baby. The Manscaped Lawnmower 3.0 is a premium
[21:32.680 --> 21:38.200]  electric trimmer that's designed to give you a confidence boost through body image. You know,
[21:38.360 --> 21:43.240]  yours. Take an image of your body. Think about it in your head and mental image. Now, uh, uh,
[21:43.240 --> 21:48.820]  improve it by like seven or eight percent. That's because of your manscaping. The ceramic blade and
[21:48.820 --> 21:54.580]  skin safe technology are designed to reduce nicks or tugs on your fellows down low. What that's
[21:54.580 --> 22:01.080]  saying in clever ways is you'll cut your dick less when you use this thing. I don't know if you've
[22:01.080 --> 22:07.380]  ever nicked your balls or the shaft of your penis or if you're a lady and you have the lady version
[22:07.380 --> 22:12.640]  of those parts and you've been doing something similar and you've nicked a labe or whatever it
[22:12.640 --> 22:19.040]  is you call it. It's not fun. The Lawnmower 3.0 is also waterproof, which is excellent if you ever
[22:19.040 --> 22:25.620]  wanted to shave your pubic hair underwater. Like, for instance, say you're Aquaman or Prince Namor.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.080]  What are you going to do? The world isn't for you. The world of men. Thanks for nothing, men.
[22:31.200 --> 22:37.080]  Not true. You can bring this baby underwater and shave your aquatic pubic hair. They have genitals
[22:37.080 --> 22:40.940]  too. Don't think about it too hard. Don't think about if they're fish genitals or human genitals
[22:40.940 --> 22:47.740]  or where they are. Just know that they're grown ass men and like men, they have men hair and men
[22:47.740 --> 22:53.160]  hair needs to be groomed. And you can use an LED light to do it. It gets darker in the bottom of
[22:53.160 --> 22:58.160]  the ocean. Not a lot of natural light sources down there. They also just released their Shears 2.0
[22:58.160 --> 23:05.420]  nail kit, which is the perfect add-on to their Lawnmower 3.0 trimmer. Imagine a freshly shewn
[23:05.420 --> 23:13.720]  pubic area, but then you have these hammer hanging, gross, sharp ass nails. You go down there
[23:13.720 --> 23:20.460]  to maybe caress the smooth and you get a snag and you rip your dick half off. You need the nail kit,
[23:20.860 --> 23:26.600]  the Shears 2.0 nail kit. In fact, listeners of this show will get 20% off. That can't be right.
[23:26.700 --> 23:30.800]  That's too much saving. Let me look, check the card. No, that's right. 20% off plus free shipping
[23:30.800 --> 23:39.460]  with the code FACE20 at manscaped.com. That's 20% off with the free shipping as well at manscaped.com
[23:39.460 --> 23:46.060]  and use code FACE20. That's F-A-C-E-2-0. You can spell FACE20. And if you can't, I just did it for
[23:46.060 --> 23:52.460]  you. Hit rewind, write it down. It's time to grab 2020 by the horns by shaving that front trunk. I
[23:52.460 --> 23:57.780]  wish mine was like a trunk. Dear Face listener, do you have a butthole? Then pay special attention.
[23:57.780 --> 24:02.360]  This ad is for you. It's hard to believe that when we go to the bathroom in this country,
[24:02.540 --> 24:07.020]  most of us wipe instead of wash. And that could be vertical wiping, that could be horizontal
[24:07.020 --> 24:12.320]  wiping. As you know, here at F*** Face Headquarters, we do both and we judge neither.
[24:12.640 --> 24:17.260]  For years, bidets have been available, but hideously expensive, costing thousands of
[24:17.260 --> 24:23.040]  dollars just for the plane ride over to Europe where they exist. The Hello Tushy modern bidet
[24:23.040 --> 24:28.360]  attachment is here to democratize the blessings bestowed by bidets and offer clean buttholes to
[24:28.360 --> 24:35.620]  everyone. Because remember, food, shelter, water, clean butthole. Those are the four tenets of a
[24:35.620 --> 24:41.100]  healthy life. Hello Tushy cleans your butt with a precise stream of fresh water for just $79.
[24:41.980 --> 24:46.220]  It attaches to your existing toilet, requires no electricity or additional plumbing,
[24:46.360 --> 24:51.640]  which is a big deal, trust me. And it cuts toilet paper use by 80%, which let's be honest, right now
[24:51.640 --> 24:56.360]  we should all be cutting our toilet paper use by 80%. So the Hello Tushy bidet pays for itself in
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.060]  a few months. Think of it as paying for itself in just a few poops. Because with Hello Tushy,
[25:02.320 --> 25:07.840]  you don't wipe at all. Even the best hoopla can't cut it when it comes to a hands-free poop experience.
[25:08.180 --> 25:12.200]  You want hands-free when you're driving down the interstate at 75 miles an hour and you gotta take
[25:12.200 --> 25:17.180]  a call from your grandma and you want hands-free when you're pooping and bidet-ing. Ditch paper
[25:17.180 --> 25:20.860]  products and uncomfortable chafing when you switch to the soothing, cleansing stream
[25:20.860 --> 25:25.540]  of water from a Hello Tushy bidet attachment. You know how I feel about bidets. I talk about
[25:25.540 --> 25:31.120]  them all the time. I talk about how unhappy my butthole was until I got a bidet, and then how
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.640]  I turned my butthole frown upside down instantly. The crazy thing was, I didn't realize my butthole
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.920]  was unhappy until I made it happy. It was like I was living... it was like my butthole... I was...
[25:41.920 --> 25:47.700]  I was asleep to the trials and tribulations of my anus. But the bidet changed my life,
[25:47.700 --> 25:53.080]  it can change yours too. Every Hello Tushy bidet attachment comes with a 60-day risk-free
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.620]  guarantee and a 12-month warranty. That's not bad. So join millions of happy Hello Tushy

[26:16.660 --> 26:21.420]  So I went through those messages and you guys had some great ideas last time we spoke about
[26:21.420 --> 26:26.200]  what I should do with the subreddit. That we were going to mess with the people in the subreddit,
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.200]  what would be a good direction to go, and I didn't listen to any of your advice, really.
[26:31.460 --> 26:34.980]  I could tell by the way you were speaking. You listened to... you decided on a subreddit,
[26:35.060 --> 26:39.720]  you're doing that. I made a discord, that is... that is correct. I went with the discord angle,
[26:39.720 --> 26:44.120]  I didn't plan on interacting with it at all, really. I was just going to make a discord,
[26:44.220 --> 26:48.120]  because I really struggled with... I want to mess with these people and I want to keep the
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.020]  Twitter conversations as genuine as possible. The people on Twitter don't necessarily want to be
[26:52.020 --> 26:57.520]  messed with. So I put the Twitter conversations on hold and I focused purely on this discord.
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.900]  And I just posted a link in the discord, no context, about, I don't know, 20 or so people
[27:02.900 --> 27:08.980]  joined into it. And then it just slowly progressed. So the first stage was I posted the
[27:08.980 --> 27:13.960]  1-800 number for Dr. Pepper, because I had a bottle on my desk. No reason, no explanation,
[27:14.360 --> 27:18.280]  just posted it. They called it and then I deleted it to make it seem sort of suspicious.
[27:18.700 --> 27:22.740]  The next day I posted a random photo of a Donkey Kong character and another number,
[27:22.900 --> 27:28.020]  this time to the Pepsi 1-800 number. And they were very confused by this as well. Equal confusion,
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.540]  deleted it. They thought a mystery was going. I followed that up with... I thought, well,
[27:32.540 --> 27:37.980]  how can I mess with these people further? So I posted a riddle. And it had an answer to it,
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.800]  but I had no real plans for the riddle. It just had an answer, it was silly, and they all went
[27:43.800 --> 27:49.400]  nuts for it. So then it turned into a week-long game, or weekend-long. I spent my entire weekend
[27:49.400 --> 27:56.480]  crafting more clues and creating more layers to this insane puzzle. That made no sense.
[27:56.720 --> 28:01.260]  They started a cult, they referred to themselves as a cult, and they worshipped the Lord Krampus,
[28:01.260 --> 28:06.240]  combining Geoff's genius of Krampus and Pissboy. I'm apparently Krampus.
[28:07.360 --> 28:13.680]  And, uh... I like Krampiss. Krampiss is my moniker that they're known for.
[28:14.820 --> 28:20.300]  And I'm gonna share with you a file they made. This is the case file that they were using to
[28:20.300 --> 28:24.820]  solve these riddles. It's dense. I became a really shitty riddler, essentially, over the weekend.
[28:25.340 --> 28:30.600]  And I don't know how to necessarily tackle all this in a linear way. So feel free to ask any
[28:30.600 --> 28:37.400]  questions you may have. Oh my god, it's literally Krampiss Conspiracy. Yeah, it's thick. There's a
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.140]  lot of shitty riddles, and it went to some pretty ridiculous places. Does it have an end goal? Are
[28:43.140 --> 28:47.860]  you just sending them all around? I made the first riddle, and it had an answer, but I didn't
[28:47.860 --> 28:52.140]  plan on doing any other riddles. But they liked it so much, I thought, I'll just keep doing this.
[28:52.160 --> 28:57.060]  So it went on for a few days, and I just kept making stuff up. It's ten pages! It's long.
[28:57.060 --> 29:02.000]  There are a lot of riddles. So after the first day, I thought, well, how can I escalate this?
[29:02.340 --> 29:08.160]  And I remember, I have that California number that I called Geoff a bunch with last time we
[29:08.160 --> 29:13.140]  recorded. And so I posted the number, and said only one person would get through. And so I got
[29:13.140 --> 29:17.780]  a bunch of calls on it, and the guy, I answered, and there was quiet for like three seconds. And
[29:17.780 --> 29:23.600]  then he said, hello? He was so nervous. And I just started playing this random sea shanty,
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.860]  and it was just like, the herring is the king of the sea, the herring is the king of the sea.
[29:28.060 --> 29:32.840]  It went on for like eight seconds, and he just went, what is going on? And then I hung up,
[29:32.860 --> 29:40.100]  and it was fantastic. It was wonderful. So yeah, I didn't do the puzzle thing, but instead I made
[29:40.100 --> 29:46.400]  a elaborate riddle filled with phoning things. I bought a Swedish phone number that just happened
[29:46.400 --> 29:51.240]  to have a 666 in it. So that was amazing. They were calling all over different numbers from
[29:51.240 --> 29:55.920]  across the country. Was it coincidentally a 666, or did you seek that out? Yeah, no,
[29:56.040 --> 30:00.100]  I didn't seek that out at all. It was just a randomly given number to me.
[30:00.300 --> 30:08.360]  You made a pointless ARG. You made an AR no G. Yeah, exactly. It was all online, obviously,
[30:08.540 --> 30:13.820]  but yeah, it got ridiculously elaborate. I used a kangaroo jack trailer. I made another Gmail
[30:13.820 --> 30:18.300]  account to leave comments on YouTube videos for them to find. It was ridiculous. They had
[30:18.300 --> 30:22.860]  no idea what was going on. What's this Matt Bragg thing? So that was another problem. Most of them
[30:22.860 --> 30:28.580]  didn't follow sports at all, and so I tried to leave clues that were sort of rooster-decent. It
[30:28.580 --> 30:33.260]  had nothing really to do with Matt Bragg. Matt Bragg happened to be born really close to where
[30:33.260 --> 30:39.800]  the actual answer of the riddle was. That was the clue. Ella Tubby's The Heisenjake Connection?
[30:40.040 --> 30:45.380]  Yes! Oh, The Heisenjake Connection was so good. So on the second day, I told them,
[30:45.380 --> 30:49.520]  because a bunch of my friends were also in this Discord, I told them that they had a snake in the
[30:49.520 --> 30:53.440]  grass and they had to vote somebody out of the Discord. They had to try to figure out whoever
[30:53.440 --> 31:02.340]  was purposefully misleading them. And so they were trying to figure out who it was. And after that
[31:02.340 --> 31:07.260]  process, I just thought, well, it'd just be funny to reveal other people. And Jake, who I've talked
[31:07.260 --> 31:12.780]  about quite a few times and pulled a lot of pranks on him, his alias is Heisenjake. And I remember
[31:12.780 --> 31:19.400]  Geoff in a video from like five years ago, a Batman Let's Watch, you say, I'm Heisenjake doing the
[31:19.400 --> 31:24.400]  Batman voice. And so I dug that up and I had somebody else say, I just found this. What does
[31:24.400 --> 31:30.060]  it mean? And they posted it and everybody freaked out. They had no idea how to take that information.
[31:30.260 --> 31:35.860]  And then I immediately banned Jake. It was me saying I'm Heisenjake? It was you saying you
[31:35.860 --> 31:41.580]  were Heisenjake. It was such an obscure, like weird joke. They didn't know how to take it. I
[31:41.580 --> 31:46.740]  banned him so he couldn't reply. So it looked like he fled immediately. And it was ridiculous.
[31:46.940 --> 31:53.780]  Who's Denise? Denise. That's, uh, Denise is funny. Denise is Geoff's daughter, Millie. She was voted
[31:53.780 --> 32:00.000]  out. They kicked Denise out, a.k.a. your daughter. They thought that she was suspicious and she was
[32:00.000 --> 32:05.560]  the person who was removed. So my daughter was the person that got voted out from the group? Yes,
[32:05.960 --> 32:11.020]  that was who they assumed the spy was. I gotta say, you guys, I knew that you guys
[32:11.020 --> 32:15.380]  were up to something because Millie gets, she was giggling the other night talking to you.
[32:15.660 --> 32:19.460]  I didn't realize that she was involved in this. That's very fucking funny. She kept it quiet
[32:19.460 --> 32:23.020]  the whole time. She never mentioned anything to me. Maybe she was embarrassed she got kicked out.
[32:24.140 --> 32:29.680]  She was not thrilled. I, uh, I didn't consider that she could rejoin from an old invite. So
[32:29.680 --> 32:33.540]  they voted her out. And then I told her, oh, you got voted out. I'm sorry that that happened.
[32:33.760 --> 32:38.680]  And she rejoined like an hour later. I was like, what the fuck is going on? Like, how dare you?
[32:38.680 --> 32:43.640]  And they didn't know how to take that either. It was great. This added to the confusion.
[32:43.960 --> 32:48.860]  How many people ended up in this discord? I'd say there were probably between 15 to 20 that
[32:48.860 --> 32:52.980]  didn't know anything that were along for this ridiculous ride. So where did it end?
[32:53.280 --> 32:57.580]  Or is it still in progress? No, they finally, they solved it on Monday. So I guess it started
[32:57.580 --> 33:03.260]  like Friday night and they solved it near the end of the day on Monday. But it was insane.
[33:03.380 --> 33:07.280]  How did they solve it? The riddle had an answer. What was the answer to the riddle?
[33:07.280 --> 33:12.940]  Sonny Jergensen. He is this old retired Washington Redskins quarterback that did
[33:12.940 --> 33:17.940]  commentary for them. And it was an inside joke between a friend and I. She'd be driving home
[33:17.940 --> 33:22.940]  and all she'd get is that radio feed. And Sonny Jergensen is kind of a legend for that team.
[33:23.400 --> 33:29.220]  But he would do commentary and he was completely useless. He wouldn't really say anything. He'd
[33:29.220 --> 33:33.980]  just stare out the window and his insights would be like, can't give Tom Brady the ball. And that's
[33:33.980 --> 33:38.640]  all he'd say for like a quarter. And so we loved him because he was a ridiculous character. So that
[33:38.640 --> 33:43.540]  was the, the answer was always Sonny Jergensen, but everything along the way was just made up
[33:43.540 --> 33:48.680]  as far as where I'd go and the phone numbers. I'm sure that was incredibly unsatisfying to solve.
[33:48.960 --> 33:53.920]  Yeah. How bummed were they? No, they were pretty like, here's the thing. It was,
[33:54.180 --> 33:58.240]  it's kind of hard to convey, but they were fully invested in this and they're phoning numbers. Like
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.540]  the journey was a lot of fun. They had a good time solving that aspect of it. And there are
[34:03.540 --> 34:08.140]  so many coincidences that made it look like I was way smarter than I intended. Like I was trying to
[34:08.140 --> 34:14.220]  get them to look at a specific NFL draft to figure out the riddle. And I put Stern in referencing
[34:14.740 --> 34:18.980]  the NBA commissioner, but they interpreted that as Howard Stern because you had mentioned it on
[34:18.980 --> 34:23.340]  a previous episode, Geoff. And so then I tried to redirect them and they just started looking into
[34:23.340 --> 34:28.180]  the NBA commissioner. And it turns out he has two sons, one named Andrew, one named Eric,
[34:28.520 --> 34:32.740]  which I had no idea about. And they're like, that motherfucker. Do you mean David Stern?
[34:32.740 --> 34:37.500]  Yeah. God rest his soul. He passed earlier this year, but yeah. Yes. He really has sons named
[34:37.500 --> 34:42.080]  Eric and Andrew. That is fucking unbelievable. So it was like they were in an escape room, but
[34:42.080 --> 34:46.840]  it was like mutating and evolving as they got stuff wrong. I feel like that is quite cool.
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.760]  It was. I'm just keep looking through. What's the Teletubbies saga? Oh, well, his name's Sonny.
[34:51.960 --> 34:55.520]  So I was trying to like get people to think that was, that was the clue for that. What's that got
[34:55.520 --> 35:00.320]  to do with Teletubbies? I posted the name of the baby who was in Teletubbies in a scrambled way
[35:00.320 --> 35:04.160]  that they had to figure out. And once they solved it, then they thought it had some deeper
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.120]  Teletubbie connection. But I was just trying to illustrate Son. That baby had a name? Well,
[35:08.140 --> 35:12.300]  the baby was a person, Gavin. Yeah. Turns out they existed. Well, yeah, it was like a twin
[35:12.300 --> 35:16.640]  girls, wasn't it? I think her name is Jess Smith. I don't know if she has a twin. I didn't look that
[35:16.640 --> 35:22.220]  deep into it, but that was the Teletubbies saga. All right. So then they solve the Sonny Jurgensen.
[35:22.740 --> 35:28.840]  Is that his name? Jurgensen? Yes. They solve the Sonny Jurgensen saga mystery. And then what is
[35:28.840 --> 35:33.280]  their reward? You just explain to them. I was just fucking around. Listen to F*** Face Tomorrow.
[35:33.420 --> 35:37.160]  It'll make sense. Yeah, well, sort of. Yeah. I mean, there wasn't like a prize reward because
[35:37.160 --> 35:42.040]  I was making it up as I went the entire time. Yeah, it was just sort of it started as a joke.
[35:42.300 --> 35:46.600]  It's not like they were upset by it. I think it was more of they were so invested in this thing
[35:46.600 --> 35:51.020]  and it was so funny for them to hear like how much of it was just me making stuff up as I went.
[35:51.860 --> 35:55.680]  So what happened to the Discord server? Did you keep it up or is it gone? It's up right now,
[35:55.680 --> 35:58.960]  but I'm going to delete it, I think, at the end of the week. What a what an interesting,
[35:59.360 --> 36:03.420]  what a not f*** face. That turned out to be a really cool thing. I feel like you went through
[36:03.420 --> 36:06.520]  all that effort just so you wouldn't have to draw the picture of the guy looking at you.
[36:07.380 --> 36:11.920]  That is, I got somebody sent me a message of what I was talking about. So someone out there knows.
[36:12.140 --> 36:16.600]  So someone's done the work for you? I want to see it. Can we just see their work? You can pretend
[36:16.600 --> 36:20.980]  you did it? It wasn't quite right. That's why I didn't copy it. It was a little different. Could
[36:20.980 --> 36:26.140]  you just do it then? Can you just do it? Yeah, I'll do it. I've been waiting, I feel like,
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.960]  two months to see what you're talking about. It's going to be our logo. By the time it comes out,
[36:31.020 --> 36:34.740]  we're just going to make it the f*** face logo. That'll be our logo. And it's going to be on
[36:34.740 --> 36:40.100]  everything. Next time. I promise. Next time I will do it. Listen, Twitter jail was tough,
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.860]  okay? I didn't have time to make drawings. So with the other part of it, the 800 people you've
[36:44.860 --> 36:49.960]  talked to, you've just essentially strengthened your relationship with 800 new people. Yeah,
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.680]  that's a good way of putting it. That sounds great until they all need help moving on the
[36:53.680 --> 37:02.380]  same weekend. Honestly, I was, I needed, I think, 250 more messages that I had left yesterday. And
[37:02.380 --> 37:06.460]  I thought, oh, this is great. I'll be able to knock out a bunch of these. And then the episode
[37:06.460 --> 37:10.480]  dropped and everybody wanted to know how they could buy the hat. And it completely buried me.
[37:10.720 --> 37:16.920]  So I've made no progress in the last day. It was awesome. I definitely, I don't regret it at all.
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.200]  I feel bad that it's taken me as long as it has to reply to all these people.
[37:21.380 --> 37:27.340]  I'm just blown away that we started on this road and at the end of it was cram piss,
[37:27.520 --> 37:35.560]  which I think is the funniest mashup of two ridiculous jokes from the same dumb episode.
[37:35.800 --> 37:38.920]  I can't believe we didn't come up with it. That's how it's going to live forever. This is like our
[37:38.920 --> 37:43.780]  Baba Booey moment, right? Oh no. When Gary said Baba Booey when he met Baba Louie on the Howard
[37:43.780 --> 37:46.900]  Stern Show. And Howard's like, that's your name from now on. And Gary goes, yeah, that'll
[37:46.900 --> 37:51.300]  stick. I don't think we need to declare that. 35 years later that he's still Baba Booey. Yeah,
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.480]  Howard, just let it go. Yeah, you're cram piss for the rest of your life. No, I don't know about
[37:55.480 --> 37:59.720]  that. I don't think we need to make that declaration. Oh my God. I feel like this was a
[37:59.720 --> 38:06.440]  nice moment that we can leave in the past. It was great. Well, it lasted. I think we can move
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.800]  on from cram piss. It'll stay in the past, except for the moments that it's brought back to the
[38:11.800 --> 38:16.420]  forefront of our memory every time we say hello to you and use the moniker cram piss. Do you think,
[38:16.420 --> 38:20.920]  Andrew, that this podcast has been better or worse for the quality of your life overall?
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.880]  Oh, way better. Oh, really? Okay. You got 800 new friends, dude. Yeah, I just talked to 800 people
[38:25.880 --> 38:29.720]  and had some really interesting conversations. It's exhausting. It's definitely more exhausting,
[38:30.040 --> 38:33.560]  but... What was the weirdest conversation? What was the creepiest one that you wanted nothing to
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.680]  do with? Oh, the creepiest one. That's tough to answer. Because 800 is a good pool. It is.
[38:39.880 --> 38:43.980]  If you had conversations with 800 people, chances are you talked to at least three serial killers,
[38:43.980 --> 38:50.440]  probably. I'd say 80% of them thought I was fucking with them in some way. So they were
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.080]  very on guard initially. And the other 20 thought I was hacked. I'm trying to think what is the
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.360]  weirdest... That doesn't have to be weird bad. Could be weird good. I mean, the getting sent
[38:59.360 --> 39:06.400]  the fart was unexpected. That's a real f*** face fan right there. Yeah. That's how we say hello
[39:06.400 --> 39:11.440]  and f*** face landia with our anus. I don't... Yeah, there's none that stick out for, like,
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.220]  weird, funny. The nose, getting the nose is pretty good, although it wasn't quite right.
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.800]  But at least somebody gets what I was saying. The nose? Well, the face, the face that you're
[39:19.800 --> 39:26.020]  talking about. Oh, it's more of a nose. Yeah. The nose is a little big for what what mine is.
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.200]  There's actually made more sense. In my head, it's some weird Picasso drawing of... I don't
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.580]  know what I'm expecting. I'm more confused than ever. You're going to be so disappointed.
[39:36.560 --> 39:39.260]  It's going to be great. What we should do. Here's what we should do.
[39:39.260 --> 39:44.140]  We should all draw it. Geoff and I will draw it based on what we think it will look like,
[39:44.460 --> 39:47.080]  based on Andrew's description. And then Andrew has to show us the real one.
[39:47.140 --> 39:51.980]  That's a great idea. I will provide any additional info. I think that's a great idea.
[39:52.340 --> 39:56.660]  Now, Gavin, should we have Andrew give us instructions as if he were the teacher,
[39:57.020 --> 40:00.880]  but we're just going by sound like we're doing it over audio? We're not like on a Zoom call or
[40:00.880 --> 40:04.860]  anything. So we're just drawing what we're hearing. Yeah, I would say you can give us like three to
[40:04.860 --> 40:10.300]  five important points that would help us draw it. Nose where the hair should be. Mouth in the
[40:10.300 --> 40:13.860]  middle. Are these all different points? You're giving us nothing. No, these are points. What
[40:13.860 --> 40:16.840]  do you mean? Well, we're not ready to draw yet. I don't even have a pencil. Well, okay. Yeah,
[40:16.880 --> 40:20.380]  just list them out there. List them out. List out all your instructions. Okay. Nose where the hair
[40:20.380 --> 40:24.960]  should be. Mouth in the middle. Standard ears. I think that's pretty good. I think you got all
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.860]  you need. I think you're going to nail it. Does it have eyeballs? No. No, it doesn't.
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.900]  No, it doesn't. It doesn't need eyeballs. That wouldn't make sense with the perspective.
[40:34.320 --> 40:39.700]  Okay. So now I'm imagining. Okay. I guess I was imagining looking up at us before,
[40:39.800 --> 40:45.840]  but now I'm imagining it's just a man standing and we're like square on with them, but he's just
[40:45.840 --> 40:49.660]  looking straight up and we're looking at his like chin and shit. Well, I don't know if he's vertical
[40:49.660 --> 40:53.600]  or not, but yeah, it's, uh, your, the nose is where the hair should be and mouth in the middle.
[40:53.920 --> 40:59.080]  But the ears are the same. Yeah. I honestly, I think I can draw this perfectly. Yeah. Geoff,
[40:59.100 --> 41:03.120]  what do you think? I'm sending it to you guys right now. I've already drawn it. You've already
[41:03.120 --> 41:08.300]  drawn it. Oh shit. I don't have to whip out Microsoft paint here. Hold on. I just drew it
[41:08.300 --> 41:13.560]  on a piece of paper. You have pens? Yeah. I found a pen. I need a pen. I'm going to get, hold on.
[41:13.720 --> 41:16.880]  Where am I looking for this? Is this going to be a text or in the chat? I texted it to you. I got
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.460]  it. Let's see. All right. Wait, wait until I've, uh, I've got text mine as well. Hold on. Geoff
[41:20.460 --> 41:27.080]  isn't even close. I drew what you said, dude. Not even slightly close. I'm going to draw mine. Hold
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.660]  on. Okay. You're going to have to vamp because obviously I've put a lot of effort into this.
[41:30.660 --> 41:34.740]  So should I have drawn a whole head and everything? Yeah, absolutely. You should have. It's a person.
[41:34.820 --> 41:38.620]  They have heads. People have heads. You didn't say to draw a head. Well, I assume the head would be
[41:38.620 --> 41:43.840]  there. Everyone has a head. You always draw a head. Um, okay. So like, Oh, now I'm a little
[41:43.840 --> 41:48.300]  nervous because if Gavin says equally as confused and I, that might fall on me. I don't think I'm
[41:48.300 --> 41:51.800]  confused. I didn't think I was confused either. Gavin. Geoff couldn't have been further off.
[41:51.960 --> 41:57.320]  I'm going to do it again. How's it going Gavin? Uh, I'm trying to load up an app that will let
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.040]  me draw on this iPad. Well, you load up the app. Could I talk about something else? Yeah. Yeah.
[42:02.180 --> 42:06.460]  Okay. This is very important. So you guys are going to need to listen to this. I'm listening.
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.140]  I'm lost. I'm lost in this as someone who is lactose intolerant for most of their life. Someone
[42:11.140 --> 42:17.020]  requested something for me that I want to be able to, uh, give the best answer, but I'm in the grass
[42:17.020 --> 42:22.360]  a little bit as far as this goes. So I got this message randomly, uh, a few days ago and, uh,
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.060]  I responded and it was someone saying, Hey, I have something I'd love to talk to you about.
[42:26.060 --> 42:30.220]  Get back to me and I'll explain more. And I didn't really expect much, but this is,
[42:30.320 --> 42:34.680]  this is the message I got in return. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the tradition in
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.460]  villages over here in the UK, but one of our aged old events is downhill cheese rolling.
[42:39.780 --> 42:44.560]  This event dates back hundreds of years and is at the core of rural English culture. As a gentleman
[42:44.560 --> 42:48.380]  who clearly has a penchant for the less than ordinary, I was hoping you could do the people
[42:48.380 --> 42:54.360]  of Xminster the honor of selecting our cheese for this year's chase. You're picking the cheese? I'm
[42:54.360 --> 43:00.240]  picking the cheese. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh my God. It does have to be a hard cheese and is
[43:00.240 --> 43:05.320]  usually a big wheel of this chosen cheese. My intention would be to dedicate this year's chase
[43:05.320 --> 43:10.200]  to yourself and to send you the cheese wheel once the event has been held. Have you seen footage of
[43:10.200 --> 43:15.920]  that? I love downhill cheese racing. I'm a big fan. It's people just eating shit and like
[43:15.920 --> 43:20.560]  dislocating their shoulder going fine. It's amazing. I want to film it in slow-mo. Andrew,
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.540]  that's one step down from being knighted. Wow. This means more to me than being knighted.
[43:25.660 --> 43:30.100]  I'm a big fan of cheese racing. I bet the queen sees the cheese you picked. Well,
[43:30.100 --> 43:32.860]  that's what I need help with. I don't know anything about cheese. What would be a good
[43:32.860 --> 43:37.120]  cheese? What's the hardest cheese? I have no idea. I feel like it would, oh, I don't know.
[43:37.460 --> 43:44.040]  Edam? I don't even know what that is. Edam? I don't know. Chirpy. It's from yaks milk. It's
[43:44.040 --> 43:50.920]  a rock. Is it? C-H-H-U-R-P-I. It's the world's hardest cheese. You're going to pick a cheese
[43:50.920 --> 43:56.220]  that's going to kill like six people in the world. That would be a concern, I'd assume. I don't know
[43:56.220 --> 44:00.640]  what the standard is for cheese racing. I'm just a big fan of watching people fall. Cheese rolling.
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.360]  Cheese rolling. I mean, they're racing. The cheese isn't racing anyone. Oh, do you know that for a
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.160]  fact? Yeah. You want a good double Gloucester cheese. Gloucester, yeah. Yeah, that's a good
[44:11.160 --> 44:14.660]  one. I'll write all these down. I'll, uh, I'll get back to that person. I'll let you know how it
[44:14.660 --> 44:18.520]  goes. I don't think they expected me to know much about cheese racing. I was saying that just to
[44:18.520 --> 44:24.100]  annoy Gavin. You need to get into it. Okay. I'll have to download a different app, probably. How
[44:24.100 --> 44:29.640]  long does it take you to load an app? I'm trying to do it in notes, but I can't do it. I'm not,
[44:29.680 --> 44:33.520]  you know what? I'm not even mad at you because you've given me so much shit of, where's your pen?
[44:33.800 --> 44:39.960]  Where's your paper? Nobody has a pen. You constantly are yelling it. Taking you six years to draw this.
[44:39.960 --> 44:43.500]  Geoff did it in a minute. I did two of them. I did twice. All right, I'm gonna get a piece of,
[44:43.560 --> 44:47.940]  I'll get a piece of paper. Technology sucks. Was my second one any better? Oh, let me look. I didn't
[44:47.940 --> 44:51.240]  know you sent a second one. Yeah, I sent it immediately because I'm not dumb like Gavin.
[44:51.460 --> 44:55.100]  No, you're still way off, but it's better. You're making progress. Knows where the hair
[44:55.100 --> 45:00.820]  should be. Nose up, not nose forward. I don't know. Up. It's, it's at the top of his brain.
[45:01.100 --> 45:06.500]  No, it's, it's like a horn, like a unicorn is the perspective. Hold on. You said nose up, huh?
[45:06.500 --> 45:11.300]  Nose up. More up than that. I feel like this is clear. Does Gavin ever come back?
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.140]  Is there, is there a scenario in which he just leaves and we never hear from him again? Okay, I'm
[45:19.300 --> 45:25.740]  Okay, mine looks, it doesn't look like it did in my head. What does that mean? It looks a bit like
[45:25.740 --> 45:31.560]  an alien. Well, that's not gonna be right. I'll say that right now. All right, I'm gonna text it.
[45:31.560 --> 45:36.900]  I just sent my third one. Okay. After that. Geoff's second looks like an alien. What is that?
[45:37.200 --> 45:42.480]  Nose was, are you, are you talking to Gavin or me? I'm talking to you. Uh, I'm sending one out.
[45:42.640 --> 45:47.580]  The third one, you said the nose up, so I put it up. You have no idea what nose up means. I put it
[45:47.580 --> 45:52.860]  higher up. This is, you're, you're a bad student. This isn't my fault. This is shit, Geoff. This is
[45:53.980 --> 46:02.500]  Gavin. Gavin essentially has it on his first try. Gavin gets it. He drew a- That's it, essentially. I mean,
[46:02.540 --> 46:06.660]  there's slightly different details. The nose is very pointed. I guess it was based on yourself,
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.540]  but- Well, that's what I look like. He drew a one-eyed man with a- No, that's a mouth. That's
[46:11.540 --> 46:15.960]  clearly a mouth and his nose is up. Geoff, what? I've just looked at Geoff's because I didn't want
[46:15.960 --> 46:22.480]  to cheat. What is the first one, Geoff? I drew what he said. He said, he never said draw hair.
[46:22.480 --> 46:27.380]  He never said draw a face or a circle. He said draw a nose where the hair would be and then draw
[46:27.380 --> 46:31.340]  a mouth and then two ears. That's what I drew. Exactly what he said. Oh, don't make me yell.
[46:31.540 --> 46:36.880]  It's for perspective and Geoff refused to change the angle on the nose the entire time.
[46:37.460 --> 46:39.920]  He just drew like an L. And on the last one...
[46:42.780 --> 46:47.400]  You went full alien for the last one. Like a Teletubby that snapped his coat.
[46:47.400 --> 46:54.900]  Oh, shit. He said to put it higher. Geoff's second and third look like something you'd
[46:54.900 --> 47:01.200]  find in like a tomb. Like a message from a different language. All right, which one of
[47:01.200 --> 47:09.740]  Geoff's designs do we want to put on a shirt? I think the second is- Well, I don't- The second
[47:09.740 --> 47:15.080]  is the worst but the third is hilarious because his interpretation of what nose up meant. I don't
[47:15.080 --> 47:22.820]  know which one I drew. If those were serious suggestions, Geoff, I'm puzzled. I drew what he
[47:22.820 --> 47:30.680]  said. You clearly didn't. Clearly, I did. Gavin's was perfect. That's art. Well, art, it's all about
[47:30.680 --> 47:35.020]  interpretation, right? That's how I interpreted the art. Not when you're trying to copy something.
[47:35.140 --> 47:38.740]  No, it's not about interpretation. Interpretation doesn't factor in at all when you're copying.
[47:38.860 --> 47:44.660]  That's baloney. It's not. It's factual. All right, we'll send all these for the video version.
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.140]  They're beautiful. Oh god, I've got tears in my eyes. I'm gonna upload mine. Look at how shit that is,
[47:50.340 --> 47:56.240]  Eric. It's atrocious. The first two especially. These look like shit. Okay, let me see what Eric
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.380]  thinks of mine. Eric, could you come on for a minute? I want an opinion not involved with this.
[48:01.740 --> 48:06.340]  I want to know if what I said made sense. Yeah, I think it made sense. Okay, let's see. We'll see
[48:06.340 --> 48:10.700]  Gavin's and see what you think. I'll put mine there now. If you think this is what it should
[48:10.700 --> 48:14.820]  look like. Yeah, look at that. Yes, that makes total sense, right? Based on what I've said. What
[48:14.820 --> 48:19.540]  I'm looking at is a nose where the hair should be, a mouth in the middle, and then if you look
[48:19.540 --> 48:24.780]  on the sides, standard ears. Standard ears. Yeah, it looks like an alien. I'm a fucking great teacher.
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.020]  I thought so. It's like an alien with a unicorn. Although you should know, Eric, that Geoff's have
[48:29.020 --> 48:34.960]  all come in in reverse. Like his first, his last one. I mean, it doesn't really matter.
[48:35.120 --> 48:38.880]  Why is the nose above the head? I mean, it doesn't really matter. They all look bad.
[48:38.880 --> 48:43.460]  Because he said it needed to be higher. He's looking up. He said, make the nose higher. Yeah, Geoff's
[48:43.460 --> 48:49.000]  makes no sense. Yeah, Geoff's makes no sense. No. I drew what he said. No. And he said, no, no, what he said,
[48:49.380 --> 48:52.940]  what he, and you can go back and listen to it when Gavin was gone, after I did the second one, he
[48:52.940 --> 48:56.400]  said, no, no, what you've got is essentially correct. The nose just needs to be a little higher up.
[48:56.580 --> 49:01.980]  And I said, okay, and so I did that, and now I'm being ridiculed. Would you describe your drawing
[49:01.980 --> 49:07.840]  as on clear, Geoff? Yeah. Are you familiar with on clear, Andrew? I'm very familiar with on clear.
[49:07.840 --> 49:13.940]  Are you familiar with the real meaning? How familiar with on clear are you? I felt like I
[49:13.940 --> 49:19.560]  was very familiar with on clear, but now you're making me doubt how clear my perception of on clear
[49:19.560 --> 49:28.600]  was. My daughter, Denise, sometimes known as Millie, she keeps me up to date on the lingo,
[49:28.860 --> 49:35.720]  you know? And she decided to trick, because I, she's really, really mad, because one time I
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.460]  convinced her that they're not flip-flops, they're flop-flips, and that she'd been saying it wrong
[49:40.460 --> 49:45.780]  her whole life, and she, kids made fun of her at school for it. And so she's had a, she's had a
[49:45.780 --> 49:49.800]  fucking chip on her shoulder for a long time about that. So she was convincing me that nobody
[49:49.800 --> 49:55.020]  says on fleek anymore, they say on clear. On clear's the new thing. And so for about a good
[49:55.020 --> 50:00.280]  ten days, I walked around the house saying on clear constantly to annoy her, only to discover
[50:00.280 --> 50:05.440]  she made that up. Nobody's ever said that. She just said it to trick me. But it worked! And so
[50:05.440 --> 50:12.520]  now on clear is the, is the hip new cool thing all the kid named Geoff are saying. So this podcast
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.160]  is on clear. It's poggers, we also say. I don't know what that means. Poggers? Oh, that means like
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.220]  this podcast slaps. I know what that means. Okay, I get it. Got it. Yeah. That was a slapping podcast.
[50:24.500 --> 50:29.960]  On clear. Should we end it? Yeah, I'm fucking, I need to go lay down. I almost passed out. Geoff
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.240]  should close it, because he's in the best head space. And Andrew, before we move on, do you plan
[50:34.240 --> 50:39.960]  on doing the burger thing this week? Next week, I will do the burger. What? 25, right? Double? I don't
[50:39.960 --> 50:44.940]  remember what I agreed to. All right, go and listen to the last week's podcast. 25 doubles. Okay, thank
[50:44.940 --> 50:49.260]  you, Eric. Next week, you're gonna lose Gavin. I don't think I will, but I do need a, uh, I want to
[50:49.260 --> 50:53.560]  watch. Hey, Eric, I have a question for the podcast while we're on the podcast. Yeah, sure. Can we have
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.520]  an Instagram account so that we can post all this stuff up on the Instagram account? Okay, so here's
[50:57.520 --> 51:02.600]  my question about that. Who's running it? I will. Okay. Or me, Andrew, and Gavin will. We can all just
[51:02.600 --> 51:07.280]  share a login. Okay, yeah. Yeah, Geoff and Andrew, yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, exactly. Yeah,
[51:07.340 --> 51:12.500]  already dwindling. So, Andrew's gonna run it. Is someone peeing? Andrew's got it. I think that
[51:12.500 --> 51:21.160]  guy's peeing. I gotta go. What? I gotta go. He's gotta get his dick out. He's excited.
[51:24.620 --> 51:29.920]  Oh, I just heard piss boy activate. That was exciting. That was like the bat signal just got
[51:29.920 --> 51:35.280]  flashed. He heard some trickling in an alley. He heard the faint whiff of ammonia and knew he was
[51:35.280 --> 51:44.040]  needed. Oh, I guess that's it. Well, you know. Oh, sorry. That's right. I'm sorry. I'm still
[51:44.040 --> 51:48.840]  right here on clear. Gavin, I am really loopy from this fucking... You got it. You got this. Root canal.
[51:49.840 --> 51:56.100]  Hey, thanks for listening to F*** Face, a podcast about hiring two women to crawl
[51:56.100 --> 52:02.520]  inside of your mouth with all of their bodies and heavy machinery and then do a fucking dance
[52:02.520 --> 52:08.180]  for two hours. If you liked it, good for you. You were supposed to. Mission accomplished.
[52:08.640 --> 52:12.940]  That was the bare minimum you needed to do is just enjoy it. We did all the hard work in
[52:12.940 --> 52:19.020]  being entertaining to you, so why don't you take the enjoyment that you received and also an ounce
[52:19.020 --> 52:24.780]  of initiative and go and rate us five or six or whatever stars because we would appreciate it.
[52:24.780 --> 52:30.600]  Write a little review. Say, I like the F*** Face podcast. I like the art. I like Geoff's art.
[52:30.880 --> 52:37.780]  Not crazy about Gavin. It was false alarm. Andrew's a bit insufferable. There you have it.
[52:37.900 --> 52:41.740]  How was it, Andrew, by the way? False alarm. It wasn't happening? Okay. It was a squirrel.
[52:42.420 --> 52:44.700]  What the fuck does that mean? I gotta go again.
