[00:41.070 --> 00:47.710]  Flintstone Kids. Flintstone Kids. No, is it... oh, it's just them as kids? That's weird.
[00:48.090 --> 00:51.590]  Why wouldn't it be about their kids? If there was another show, there was another cartoon
[00:51.590 --> 00:56.390]  in the 70s that was the Pebbles and Bam Bam show, and it was Pebbles, Bam Bam, and their
[00:56.390 --> 01:02.190]  friends as teenagers. Hey, let me ask you this. What was the Scooby-Doo as a kid called?
[01:02.190 --> 01:07.690]  Oh, a pup named Scooby-Doo. You're damn right! See that, Drew? Yeah! There's been a million.
[01:07.910 --> 01:12.690]  There was also Scooby-Doo and the 13 Ghosts. There was a bunch. Yeah. What was the one
[01:12.690 --> 01:19.030]  where Scooby-Doo was friends with the vampires and Mummy and... Scooby the Vampire Slayer.
[01:19.510 --> 01:24.910]  Well, that's a great one. Then there was the one... who was the kid who said, like, Razzle
[01:24.910 --> 01:30.150]  Dazzle or Flim Flam or something? That's what I remember. Oh, Razzle Dazzle. You mean, uh...
[01:30.150 --> 01:35.490]  Are you talking about the Grey Kazoo? No, no, there was a thing called... there's a character
[01:35.490 --> 01:42.610]  named Flim Flam or something like that. Would he go, Razzle Dazzle? I don't think so. No,
[01:42.690 --> 01:49.410]  he wore a yellow hoodie. This is all just great. I've been rolling as well. Andrew, you rolling?
[01:49.910 --> 01:55.870]  No, I wasn't. Crank up the fire extinguisher, Andrew! Hey, it's good to go. I'm rolling.
[01:56.430 --> 02:00.810]  When did Scooby-Doo team up with a vampire? And how did I not know that this was a thing?
[02:01.290 --> 02:03.110]  Well, what year were you born? 94.
[02:05.010 --> 02:11.150]  But I watched Canadian, like, cartoons filled with, like, old Hanna-Barbera stuff.
[02:11.710 --> 02:18.210]  You were born the same year that Friends came out. Really? That's weird.
[02:19.010 --> 02:21.070]  What year were you born? 94.
[02:21.070 --> 02:26.130]  Oh, fuck. You were born the year that Ace Ventura Pet Detective came out.
[02:26.210 --> 02:30.910]  Yeah, you know what? Fun fact. This is an actual accurate fact. There are only two times
[02:30.910 --> 02:37.790]  where a sequel reached the top 10 of a box office year domestically. When the first one didn't,
[02:37.890 --> 02:40.930]  Ace Ventura is one of those movies. First one not top 10. Geoff hates the second one.
[02:41.070 --> 02:44.050]  Second one in the top 10. That and Rambo. Only two.
[02:44.370 --> 02:47.950]  The second Ace Ventura is unwatchably bad. It's a travesty.
[02:47.950 --> 02:51.650]  Is it fun bad, though? No, it's not. There's nothing good bad about it.
[02:51.870 --> 02:56.530]  I used to love both of those movies, and Geoff explained to me that the second one is,
[02:56.670 --> 03:01.630]  in fact, really bad. And then he gave a bunch of reasons. And now I only see it as bad whenever
[03:01.630 --> 03:08.130]  I watch it. And you can't really enjoy the first one anymore because it's incredibly transphobic.
[03:08.530 --> 03:10.530]  Oh, God, that's right. Yeah.
[03:10.650 --> 03:15.750]  I haven't seen either of them. But from what I know about Ace Ventura, it is hilarious to me
[03:15.750 --> 03:21.150]  that Geoff would have to provide some high level of insight into the failings of the second movie.
[03:21.250 --> 03:22.530]  I thought it was great as a kid.
[03:22.690 --> 03:26.150]  That it was. When you're a kid, that's a different thing. But you're saying like,
[03:26.230 --> 03:31.070]  Geoff really explained to me the deeper meanings of Ace Ventura, too. And then I realized it's not
[03:31.070 --> 03:34.490]  that great. The second one has all these references to other movies. You know,
[03:34.490 --> 03:40.470]  you got the cliffhanger bit at the beginning. But then the character himself is just a complete
[03:41.050 --> 03:44.750]  buffoon. He's a parody of the character in the first movie.
[03:44.750 --> 03:49.790]  In the first one, he's like an insane person, but he actually has he has goals. He has like
[03:50.670 --> 03:56.490]  reasons for doing everything. In the second one, he's an absolute insane asylum person.
[03:56.990 --> 04:02.010]  Yeah. In the first one, he's a wacky dude. He's a wacky human. In the second one,
[04:02.150 --> 04:04.970]  he's just the one liners that a wacky human said.
[04:05.330 --> 04:09.230]  Like Inspector Clouseau type goofy or what goofy are we talking for the first one?
[04:09.330 --> 04:12.570]  Like, yeah, like a dirtier Inspector Clouseau.
[04:12.630 --> 04:12.910]  Okay.
[04:12.910 --> 04:19.010]  I mean, he doesn't like fail forward as much, but he's it's like, well, I guess he kind of does.
[04:19.170 --> 04:26.010]  Yeah, yeah. That's like a modern day, a little more with it, more poop humor Inspector Clouseau.
[04:26.270 --> 04:30.610]  Not as inept, but, you know, still in the same vein.
[04:30.810 --> 04:34.210]  Should we end the movie podcast and start the Facebook?
[04:34.450 --> 04:39.370]  You guys started this. I came in and people were screaming about Scooby-Doo and vampires.
[04:39.370 --> 04:44.550]  Do you know why this happened? I joined the discord. There was no one in here apart from
[04:44.550 --> 04:50.010]  Andrew. I joined and went bam, because I was exactly on 3 p.m., perfectly on time. And he
[04:50.010 --> 04:54.670]  went bam. And then he started talking about Bam Bam. And then it all just went off from there
[04:54.670 --> 04:58.270]  on Flintstones Kids and all that. I didn't know why you did the bam. And then I thought I was
[04:58.270 --> 05:02.390]  dropping some great trivia with Marty O'Donnell and Flintstones Kids. And then it turned into this
[05:02.390 --> 05:07.290]  broader conversation about vitamins and television. Do you remember the song that
[05:07.290 --> 05:11.530]  Bam Bam sang that was like their song? I didn't remember Flintstones Kids, so no.
[05:11.910 --> 05:15.150]  Oh, OK. Well, this was in the original Flintstones. We have to stop talking.
[05:15.590 --> 05:22.250]  So let the sun shine in and chase away your blues. Cause smilers never lose and frowners never win.
[05:22.290 --> 05:24.950]  So let the sun... Have you ever heard that song? That's a fucking awesome song.
[05:25.250 --> 05:27.790]  No, I don't think I have. I'll check it out.
[05:28.050 --> 05:31.010]  The time you try to learn to let the sun shine in.
[05:31.190 --> 05:34.930]  What if you got punched in the head so hard you had muscle failure and you were in a constant
[05:34.930 --> 05:38.430]  state of frown? Does that mean you're just a loser and you shouldn't bother doing anything
[05:38.930 --> 05:41.890]  for the rest of your life? Is this a Flintstones thing?
[05:42.470 --> 05:45.110]  I thought you said losers, but was it frowners?
[05:45.550 --> 05:47.510]  Smilers never lose and frowners never win.
[05:47.770 --> 05:50.030]  I got lost in the rhythm. I wasn't picking up on the words.
[05:51.770 --> 05:53.850]  All right. Remember Wacky Races?
[05:54.350 --> 05:56.750]  Lost in the rhythm should be the name of our next podcast.
[05:57.270 --> 05:59.190]  No, Wacky Races was really good.
[05:59.210 --> 06:01.950]  I want to know about burgers, Andrew. I want to know about hamburgers.
[06:01.950 --> 06:06.410]  You can get the burgers. Wacky Races was a phenomenal show.
[06:06.670 --> 06:10.890]  Wacky Races was a great show, but all I can think of now after Andrew said he got lost in the rhythm
[06:10.890 --> 06:19.550]  is Andrew like in sexy flamenco wear like in a 90s movie in like Miami where he's like some Cuban
[06:19.550 --> 06:25.790]  dude from the streets who knows how to dance like salsa and he works his way up and it's
[06:25.790 --> 06:28.410]  like a rags to riches type story. Did I leave my webcam on?
[06:28.410 --> 06:29.490]  This is...
[06:31.350 --> 06:36.510]  Andrew, can you, by any chance, can you fire your fire extinguisher? Can you use it right now?
[06:36.950 --> 06:40.630]  No. Well, yeah, I mean, I could, but no, I'm not going to. Why would I do this?
[06:40.650 --> 06:43.390]  It would sound really good. It would sound like...
[06:43.390 --> 06:46.670]  There is no coming back from that. The podcast is done.
[06:47.010 --> 06:49.410]  What a perfect start to an episode of F*** Face.
[06:49.730 --> 06:53.490]  Then F*** Facing your desk and everything that holds up the equipment you need to make it.
[06:53.510 --> 06:56.430]  I'm still in my blanket fort. I would ruin my sheets.
[06:56.430 --> 06:58.530]  It would be real bad. We can't...
[06:58.530 --> 07:04.050]  What I'm hearing is the damage would be contained to with inside the safety.
[07:04.190 --> 07:08.050]  No, you have not seen a fire extinguisher go off if you think that's containing it.
[07:08.110 --> 07:09.930]  It is like a bomb. It just goes everywhere.
[07:10.210 --> 07:15.510]  Eric, this is what happens when we get here before you. I'm going to blame you entirely for this.
[07:15.610 --> 07:20.310]  Yeah. Eric is in a weird spot too, because I did something that might be illegal
[07:20.310 --> 07:25.450]  that I deeply tied him to and I was going to tell him about it before we went.
[07:25.450 --> 07:28.690]  But there's no time for that. We'll just find that out later.
[07:29.110 --> 07:34.550]  Well, everyone, welcome to F*** Face, the podcast where we get together every week and
[07:34.550 --> 07:37.690]  talk about fun pranks and what we've all been doing together.
[07:38.090 --> 07:40.410]  Andrew, I heard you've been doing some crazy hamburger stuff.
[07:40.430 --> 07:42.670]  I'll get to it eventually. Do we need to introduce the show?
[07:42.830 --> 07:46.490]  Does anyone ever click on something like a podcast and not know what it is?
[07:46.610 --> 07:48.410]  I don't know, dude. I don't feel like the intro is necessary.
[07:48.730 --> 07:54.390]  I don't know. But if that's the kind of energy and talent that Eric brings to an intro,
[07:54.390 --> 07:58.170]  I think he should do it every week. I think he should be the official announcer of F*** Face.
[07:58.170 --> 08:00.130]  If it's mandatory, I would agree with that statement.
[08:00.290 --> 08:05.890]  Because that was a professional at the top of his game,
[08:06.590 --> 08:11.430]  rolling up, fully prepared, and putting on a clinic. That was good.
[08:12.030 --> 08:13.950]  Thank you very much. You got the job!
[08:14.810 --> 08:17.850]  Oh, great. I don't want it. Well, sleep on it.
[08:18.390 --> 08:21.130]  Is the intro necessary, Eric? Yes, yes, yes.
[08:21.410 --> 08:22.190]  Why though? Why is it necessary?
[08:22.190 --> 08:26.670]  You have to think about it like that. You know what? I can relate it to something that I was
[08:26.670 --> 08:36.510]  doing today. I submitted this show to the streamies. You didn't have to laugh at that part.
[08:37.510 --> 08:38.310]  That's funny.
[08:40.370 --> 08:47.550]  So, I submitted this show to the streamies. And what I had to do was find an exemplary episode
[08:48.110 --> 08:52.730]  and then also a standout highlight. And what I ended up doing was clicking through a bunch of
[08:52.730 --> 08:58.430]  the episodes where they just start with nonsense. And I kept thinking, if I was a person and I found
[08:58.430 --> 09:04.750]  this show or somebody recommended it to me and I listened to the sixth episode and it was this,
[09:04.870 --> 09:08.490]  I would just go, what's happening? I agree with you.
[09:08.990 --> 09:13.230]  The problem with trying to get us to do the intro six minutes into the podcast
[09:13.690 --> 09:18.890]  is that it doesn't throw the intro back through time to the beginning of the recording.
[09:19.390 --> 09:26.250]  That's right. But maybe people stick around and then they go, oh, maybe this show is like
[09:26.250 --> 09:31.270]  this sometimes, but they still do the intro and I'll know what this show is.
[09:31.350 --> 09:35.830]  In that case, I recommend you be here on time next week, Eric, so that we don't get lost in
[09:35.830 --> 09:39.910]  ourselves. Wait, when you say know what the show is, do you mean literally the name of the show?
[09:40.510 --> 09:43.770]  No, just what what is that? You know, somebody might recommend this like,
[09:43.870 --> 09:48.330]  oh, I really like this podcast. It's really funny. You have to check it out. And that
[09:48.330 --> 09:52.090]  might be the end of the recommendation. And then they come in and then it's you going,
[09:52.330 --> 09:55.830]  wacky races, wacky races. You know what this is?
[09:55.930 --> 10:01.450]  It's a great show. You know what it is? I just realized Eric is super fucking excited about
[10:01.450 --> 10:06.230]  just getting the gig as the announcer. And Andrew immediately tries to take that job away from him.
[10:06.230 --> 10:12.630]  Andrew, you can have it. Eric's scrambling. He's scrambling not to lose the thing he just
[10:12.630 --> 10:18.330]  got that he worked so hard for. I fucking applaud you, Eric. I'm on your side. We need
[10:18.330 --> 10:23.050]  an intro every week. And you're right. It has to be you. I've been getting a lot of tweets every
[10:23.050 --> 10:27.810]  time a fuckface comes out. People who find it seem to like it for some reason. However,
[10:28.390 --> 10:35.370]  if you do hashtag fuckface with the asterisks, that doesn't work at all. The asterisks
[10:35.930 --> 10:41.750]  end the hashtag at F. So all you actually get is hashtag F and then a bunch of letters that don't
[10:41.750 --> 10:46.250]  link anything together. It's a worse name than I even thought originally.
[10:46.610 --> 10:50.090]  Oh, it's a perfect. It's a perfect Twitter fuckface. Yeah.
[10:51.770 --> 10:56.430]  You're fuckfacing yourself by trying to reference it with a hashtag. It can't be done.
[10:57.010 --> 11:01.690]  Andrew, if you just give the fire extinguisher a squeeze, we can crack on with the episode.
[11:01.690 --> 11:07.510]  No, I'm not happening. Okay. I mean, maybe episode. No, I'm not going to promise anything.
[11:07.630 --> 11:13.230]  That's a real problem. Fire extinguishers are a real problem. They solve problems.
[11:13.650 --> 11:16.490]  No, if you do it recreationally, it's a real problem.
[11:17.250 --> 11:21.250]  How do you know? Do you speak of experience? I watched a reality show recently where the guy
[11:21.250 --> 11:24.950]  fired a fire extinguisher in a room and it was a fucking disaster. It went everywhere,
[11:25.770 --> 11:30.690]  suffocated the people. Let me counter that argument with an argument that I know for a fact,
[11:30.690 --> 11:37.930]  Gavin will support. Okay. I have seen every episode and film of Jackass multiple, multiple
[11:37.930 --> 11:44.490]  times. Nobody ever died from a fire extinguisher, but every time one went off, it was hilarious.
[11:44.830 --> 11:49.870]  It was always worthwhile. Why are you trying to convince me by saying I'm going to make a
[11:49.870 --> 11:53.430]  statement that Gavin will agree with? Because Gavin agrees with. I agree with that. I agree
[11:53.430 --> 11:57.810]  with that. That doesn't matter. I'm the one that doesn't agree. You're not. You're swaying Gavin.
[11:58.250 --> 12:03.030]  Dude, the point is majority rules. It's two to one. You don't have a choice.
[12:03.310 --> 12:07.230]  Why don't you fucking buy a fire extinguisher and fire it? You start.
[12:07.490 --> 12:12.230]  What? That doesn't help us right now. Are you worried that it's going to break something?
[12:12.750 --> 12:16.050]  It's going to shoot everything. It's going to hit my computer. It's going to hit boxes.
[12:16.470 --> 12:20.050]  You just need to give it a little puff. Yeah. There's no sneeze.
[12:20.490 --> 12:26.650]  I don't. Like four, four percent pressure. I don't. How would I know what that even looks
[12:26.650 --> 12:29.930]  like? I've never fired one. Well, don't floor it. Don't like.
[12:30.770 --> 12:34.410]  I don't trust myself. Don't. Yeah. Don't treat it like a Lamborghini.
[12:34.890 --> 12:37.950]  Well, I'm not going to. I'm not going to force you into this. I'm just saying it would sound
[12:37.950 --> 12:42.390]  amazing and it would be absolutely no effort for Geoff or myself.
[12:43.050 --> 12:47.650]  That's that. That is. I get that logic. I support that fully.
[12:47.650 --> 12:55.150]  Andrew. Yes. Will you take a new photo of your bedroom fort and as
[12:55.950 --> 13:02.390]  as your recording space exists today in this episode? And also, do you have photos of the
[13:02.390 --> 13:07.510]  fire extinguisher set up? Right. Yeah. OK. When we eventually do like baseball cards or something,
[13:07.510 --> 13:12.350]  I think those will be those would be rarities. We've got to include those.
[13:12.350 --> 13:18.510]  We also need to make a card of us redesigned artistically as people from Wacky Races.
[13:19.090 --> 13:25.070]  Oh, yeah. From a baseball card. I think Wacky Races was the first sporting loss that devastated
[13:25.070 --> 13:30.570]  me as a child. I distinctly remember cheering for teams and having them fall apart in the last leg
[13:30.570 --> 13:34.950]  and just being heartbroken. It's the first sporting event I fell in love with.
[13:35.770 --> 13:39.350]  It's a great sport. You know what else we could put on the card, though?
[13:39.350 --> 13:45.290]  Bath race? Bath? Well, that's hey, that could also be on there. I've promised something for a long
[13:45.290 --> 13:50.430]  time, several weeks, and it's fallen through every time I've forgotten. Things have come up.
[13:50.990 --> 13:59.550]  But today. Today, I delivered on this promise. Art. You're about to see art. The photo I've
[13:59.550 --> 14:07.110]  been talking about for weeks. Finally here. Right. But we or you, you wait. It's so long
[14:07.110 --> 14:11.710]  that we already did it last week. What is that? What does that give us now? We already know what
[14:11.710 --> 14:15.850]  a damn thing looks like. No, you didn't know what it looked like. I gave you instructions.
[14:16.470 --> 14:22.670]  As Erica's saying, standard ears, nose where the hair should be, mouth in the middle. My
[14:22.670 --> 14:29.270]  directions were very clear. And it looks great. You scroll up like one screen, all of our drawings
[14:29.270 --> 14:34.750]  already there. That provides nothing. Those are interpretations of the original. I'm providing
[14:34.750 --> 14:40.850]  the original. I'm going back and I'm seeing on my pictures a nose where hair should be,
[14:41.570 --> 14:47.190]  a mouth in the middle, and ears where ears go. I agree we've already done it, but I don't think
[14:47.190 --> 14:55.850]  we should be using your pictures as the example. God damn it. It's pretty close to what I did.
[14:56.550 --> 15:00.230]  Obviously, you've got more detail because yours is bigger. You got more detail on the lobes.
[15:00.230 --> 15:07.930]  On the nostrils. Yeah, I mean, this was it. This has been asked for probably over a month now.
[15:08.630 --> 15:12.490]  And you know what I didn't expect, but I should have fucking getting shit about it when I finally
[15:12.490 --> 15:20.190]  provide it. That's what I didn't anticipate. It's just unnecessary. It's like Gavin and I did 99%
[15:20.190 --> 15:24.990]  of the work and then you show up. Check the fucking tapes. I feel like last week you guys
[15:24.990 --> 15:28.730]  were like, we'll do our interpretations and then you can show yours and we'll see how close they
[15:28.730 --> 15:37.350]  are. That last week would have been the time where you'd have done yours. That's like me ordering 14
[15:37.350 --> 15:42.390]  broken Russian MAGA hats and showing them to you this week when it's already done with. I don't
[15:42.390 --> 15:46.730]  even know what that means. I don't understand what you're saying. Andrew, there's only one of those.
[15:47.210 --> 15:52.410]  The only reason we drew the fucking face perfectly, I might add, at least in my view. You don't know
[15:52.410 --> 16:00.870]  anything about last week. The only reason we drew it. I remember this part. The only reason we drew it
[16:00.870 --> 16:07.270]  is because you wouldn't. No, it's not that I wouldn't. I couldn't. I wasn't opposed. I once again wasn't opposed.
[16:07.390 --> 16:11.110]  That's a good point. Do you remember much of last week, Geoff? Or were you just completely off your tits?
[16:11.290 --> 16:17.490]  I was pretty off my tits. It's like, it's not 100%, but it's better. I gotta go back in like
[16:17.490 --> 16:24.550]  two weeks and get the temporary crown cranked off, and then the root canal fininished.
[16:24.990 --> 16:34.410]  What? Geoff may still be on medicine. I just get the root canal finished, or the root
[16:34.410 --> 16:40.550]  cow fininished, as I just said, and then go through it all over again. So I'll let you,
[16:40.810 --> 16:46.230]  you know, I'm doing okay right now, but I'm not looking forward to being me in like 10 days or so.
[16:46.230 --> 16:51.530]  I'm glad we've seen your version of it, Andrew. I'm glad it's there, but it's not the revelation
[16:51.530 --> 16:56.670]  that I was hoping for. We already got that last week. Yeah, that's my issue with it. You didn't
[16:56.670 --> 17:02.050]  get it last week. What does that one provide? That's what it actually looks like. Yeah,
[17:02.050 --> 17:07.130]  but last week I didn't have any idea. If you had never seen the fucking pyramids and someone
[17:07.130 --> 17:11.270]  described the pyramids for you to draw, and then they showed you the real pyramids, you wouldn't
[17:11.270 --> 17:16.050]  be like, I already seen it. I drew that a week ago. What are you talking about? You're comparing
[17:16.050 --> 17:21.310]  your picture to one of the ancient wonders of the world. I'd say that photo's pretty fucking
[17:21.310 --> 17:29.150]  wonderful. Oh man, I gotta see a side-by-side comparison between Andrew's photo, Andrew's
[17:29.150 --> 17:35.150]  drawing, and the fucking Great Pyramid of Giza. That's awesome. Which one took longer to make?
[17:35.150 --> 17:38.410]  Oh, who drew it better?
[17:39.850 --> 17:44.950]  I'm 32, juggling family, working full-time, and earning a bachelor's degree. At University of

[18:59.770 --> 19:04.870]  about burgers, the old bet. Obviously, you didn't do it last week because you were busy
[19:06.550 --> 19:10.890]  talking to everyone on the internet. Yep. Yeah. But this week... That was a good job.
[19:10.990 --> 19:15.610]  Or was it three weeks ago? No, no. It was two weeks ago. It doesn't matter. I don't think it
[19:15.610 --> 19:19.850]  matters. I don't think it matters either. But you've done the 25 burgers, or you've at least
[19:20.250 --> 19:24.890]  tried. I made an attempt. You don't know the result of the attempt. No, I don't. I talked a
[19:24.890 --> 19:29.090]  lot of shit the day of. You talked so much shit. I'm going to get my slacks up because we were
[19:29.810 --> 19:34.330]  we're talking a lot, but you weren't really giving me any details on how it was. It's sort
[19:34.330 --> 19:38.730]  of weird. Yeah, I didn't know because of the podcast. It's a strange thing to talk about with
[19:38.730 --> 19:46.310]  you. I mean, when you look at the bag, it seems very doable. Looking at a top down, that doesn't
[19:46.310 --> 19:52.690]  seem that bad. I don't I don't know what you're talking about. I wouldn't even be able to eat
[19:52.690 --> 19:56.690]  half of that. Well, you know what? It doesn't look bad. That looks awful. It looks like a cow
[19:56.690 --> 20:04.270]  in a bag. Okay, well, I guess compared to 50 singles, which is the scale I'm using, it's a lot
[20:04.790 --> 20:10.470]  easier to approach. That doesn't seem nearly as scary to me. I talked a lot of shit. And Gavin,
[20:10.690 --> 20:17.050]  I was kind of phrasing things in a weird way that was panicking Gavin. He did not understand
[20:17.050 --> 20:23.250]  how I was moving through these burgers with the speed in which I was doing it. Every single time
[20:23.250 --> 20:27.510]  I would give him a realistic problem on why it wasn't necessarily going to be a breeze.
[20:27.990 --> 20:33.710]  He would just say he was going to do it fast. Yeah, I was going to eat faster than my stomach
[20:33.710 --> 20:39.190]  realized it was full. Makes sense. Makes total sense. And here's here's my strategy. Okay,
[20:39.250 --> 20:44.290]  Gavin, you don't know this. You haven't seen this photo. This is what I did. This is my 200 IQ
[20:44.290 --> 20:50.290]  plate. Last time, the buns were a problem. The buns really weighed me down. So I thought,
[20:50.290 --> 20:55.030]  this is what I'm going to do. We're going to prioritize meat first. So I went all plain
[20:55.030 --> 21:00.410]  with my burger order this time. All plain burgers, put on my own condiments. I used home condiments.
[21:00.870 --> 21:07.730]  This isn't a way game. And I stacked them. I was doing burger stacks. I came out of the gate with
[21:07.730 --> 21:13.950]  an eight burger stack. Just coming out blazing. So that's a looks like six. That's eight.
[21:14.890 --> 21:21.350]  Okay. So it's like an octoburger. It's a bit. Yeah, it's an eight burger stack. And I slammed
[21:21.350 --> 21:25.770]  that thing down. It was a little too big for my mouth. But that still leaves you with 10
[21:25.770 --> 21:31.630]  bun pieces to eat. Yeah, that's a later problem. I just needed to get through the meat. I felt like
[21:31.630 --> 21:36.590]  the buns would be easy to consume slowly over time. It was really... I'm looking at some of
[21:36.590 --> 21:41.690]  our argument here. You were going on about... I was going to suggest, like I did last time,
[21:41.690 --> 21:45.730]  you keep the oven on, keep the other ones warm so that you wouldn't be eating cold burgers.
[21:46.230 --> 21:50.410]  Andrew says, my plan is just to eat them all in the first hour so they don't get cold.
[21:51.490 --> 21:59.070]  And I just wrote one hour. One. He said also no more condiments. This is a home game this time
[21:59.070 --> 22:05.310]  around. No more road condiments. 25 in one hour is what I'm saying. Andrew says, I'm big braining
[22:05.310 --> 22:11.770]  this thing. I said big brain, small stomach, regular human sized stomach. You said if I eat
[22:11.770 --> 22:17.370]  quick enough, my body won't know it's full. I said that's like saying if I quickly fill this
[22:17.370 --> 22:21.710]  pint glass with beer, I'll be able to fit more beer in it. That doesn't... I don't think the two
[22:21.710 --> 22:27.870]  relate at all. When all you're in fact left with is a cup full to the brim and now the beer is foamy.
[22:28.350 --> 22:34.510]  Speed has no play in this. There's nothing to do with speed in any of this. No, you've clearly
[22:34.510 --> 22:41.050]  never tried this. Speed has a lot to do with everything. It's a sprint. You run out of stamina
[22:41.050 --> 22:46.850]  in this. And if you can go fast, you can get a lot done. You need to do a lot in the first,
[22:47.050 --> 22:52.470]  I'd say, 30 minutes. But it's just mass. The mass is the same, Andrew. No, but eventually
[22:52.470 --> 22:59.650]  it becomes a mental game and you can, if you're fast enough, you can clear more damage than before
[22:59.650 --> 23:05.190]  it becomes mental. Okay, how did it go then? What came next? Uh, well, I did really well.
[23:05.950 --> 23:12.830]  I kept going. I had three hours left and this is all that remained. This is it. I was down to three
[23:12.830 --> 23:18.310]  stacks. You didn't eat everything in the first hour? No, no, that was a little ambitious. I also,
[23:19.110 --> 23:24.270]  I just, I, yeah, I, for some reason in my head, I kept thinking doubles were singles. So I was
[23:24.270 --> 23:29.070]  thinking 25 burgers at one point. It was a great miscalculation. So I want to make sure I understand
[23:29.070 --> 23:35.650]  it and can describe this to the audience. I just got confused. You can get into that because I
[23:35.650 --> 23:41.070]  don't know, dude. Uh, it looks like you're left with three burgers that are all... Three stacks.
[23:41.330 --> 23:47.410]  Three stacks. How big are the stacks? Six stacks. Six stacks. So that's 18, okay, six stacks of six.
[23:47.630 --> 23:53.430]  Are you telling me that you ordered 25 doubles but then you were counting single patties as whole
[23:53.430 --> 23:57.990]  burgers? There may have been a point in time at which I was thinking, well, yeah, when I was
[23:57.990 --> 24:02.510]  telling you the 20, when I said I'd done the 20 in the hour, that was just patties with the buns.
[24:02.710 --> 24:08.710]  Right, so really, yeah, nowhere near the 50 that you have to get. So where's all the buns going?
[24:09.050 --> 24:14.070]  Oh, I'm just stacking them to the side. I just have a bun stack on the corner of my desk. So I'm
[24:14.070 --> 24:20.570]  looking at the three burger, the stack right now. This is with three hours to go. There's off camera
[24:20.570 --> 24:27.650]  a pile of buns, like, oh yeah, a great pyramid, if you will, a bun pyramid. Okay. So you're saying
[24:27.650 --> 24:35.170]  once per hour, you have to eat one of those six stacks and then all the remaining buns as well.
[24:35.670 --> 24:39.150]  I'd eventually, yeah, well, my goal is honestly, I just thought if I can get through the meat,
[24:39.230 --> 24:42.750]  I can get through the buns. It's the meat is the real problem. What were you doing for the first
[24:42.750 --> 24:47.390]  seven hours though? What do you mean? I was eating constantly. This is three hours left and you've
[24:47.390 --> 24:51.730]  got all of that left. This is three hours, yeah, that's what I had left with like three hours to go.
[24:52.190 --> 24:59.730]  It's tough. I gotta ask, is a bun with six to eight patties inside, does that taste good?
[25:00.030 --> 25:04.890]  It doesn't look good. It tastes the same as a bun with two. I don't think the number of patties
[25:04.890 --> 25:10.930]  changes the taste of them. That's ridiculous. The ratio's all off. Of course it tastes different.
[25:11.250 --> 25:14.490]  What do you mean by the ratio? Well, I mean, why bother eating any bun at all?
[25:15.150 --> 25:20.010]  If you've got 20 patties and one bun, you're just going to be mainly eating ground beef
[25:20.010 --> 25:24.570]  or whatever a McDonald's burger is made of. I just don't want to eat the McDonald's burger
[25:24.570 --> 25:29.610]  though. I'm a classy individual. I need a bun on that. I'm not just going to eat the meat plain.
[25:29.650 --> 25:34.450]  So you had nothing between the meat, no pickles or onions or sauce?
[25:34.910 --> 25:41.070]  I would do ketchup. I brought my own ketchup into it, but yeah, no pickles. Apparently mustard can
[25:41.070 --> 25:45.870]  cause you to vomit in eating competitions or something. So I avoided that. No mustard this
[25:45.870 --> 25:52.470]  time. That's what I learned the night before the competition. I Googled tips for competitive
[25:52.470 --> 26:00.050]  eating and I read several sites and every tip I would look at, I'd read and go, I'm not doing
[26:00.050 --> 26:04.310]  that. That seems like a lot of work. That seems like, that seems like too much. I'm not interested
[26:04.310 --> 26:07.810]  in that. So, but I did learn the mustard apparently makes you throw up for some reason.
[26:07.950 --> 26:13.450]  Did you throw up? No, I didn't. There was no rule against it, but I felt like that'd be cheating.
[26:14.010 --> 26:19.090]  So I did. At one point during our conversation, I started cheering you on. I said, that makes
[26:19.090 --> 26:22.190]  sense. You know what? I want the best for you. I'm cheering you on. I actually think you can do it.
[26:22.470 --> 26:26.270]  You took that as some sort of weird Jedi mind trick that I was trying to play.
[26:26.450 --> 26:30.170]  Yeah, it's not. I don't believe it. I still don't believe it. That's a blatant lie.
[26:30.550 --> 26:35.570]  Then you said 25 might be ambitious, but I genuinely plan on knocking 12 of these things
[26:35.570 --> 26:40.250]  out within the first 30 minutes. Then once again, I'm reminding you of the actual maths,
[26:40.250 --> 26:44.430]  that that is one every two minutes. Math is just a downer when you're
[26:44.430 --> 26:48.710]  doing something like this. You don't need to know the math. That just makes it seem harder.
[26:48.950 --> 26:52.970]  I broke it down to bites. I was like, oh, so six bites per burger. That's one bite
[26:53.810 --> 26:58.450]  every 20 seconds for half an hour. Yeah, that seems like a lot. If you would lay it out that
[26:58.450 --> 27:03.010]  way, I'd say, no, I couldn't do that. But if I don't do the math and I just go purely on confidence,
[27:03.170 --> 27:07.470]  I'm very confident. I was just trying to make, I was trying to phrase this challenge in a way
[27:07.470 --> 27:11.710]  that would make you see that it's not just going to be a breeze that you can
[27:11.710 --> 27:14.590]  speed through by just shoving stuff down your throat.
[27:14.830 --> 27:19.090]  Deep down, I always know it's not going to be a breeze, Gavin, but if I pretend it is,
[27:19.230 --> 27:25.530]  then if it somehow ends up being, I'm just giving myself confidence is what that is.
[27:25.750 --> 27:28.910]  So did you successfully kid yourself, do you think?
[27:29.710 --> 27:34.070]  Yeah, well, I always kid myself into thinking this is going to be no problem at all. And then
[27:34.750 --> 27:41.650]  unfortunate math and reality comes into play. This is what I ended up with. This is the final
[27:42.410 --> 27:48.010]  picture coming through now. I ate 44 meat patties. That's all I had left,
[27:48.770 --> 27:49.670]  including the buns.
[27:50.510 --> 27:54.090]  So that is the end of 10 hours. Is that a failure?
[27:54.310 --> 27:56.790]  That's the end. That is a failure. I did not do it.
[27:56.910 --> 27:57.830]  You got close.
[27:58.090 --> 27:59.030]  I did get really close.
[27:59.110 --> 28:00.490]  So what is that? There's a...
[28:00.490 --> 28:02.710]  I started making smaller stacks.
[28:02.710 --> 28:07.990]  I can see that you've double bunned the front one and the one at the back looks like it's just buns.
[28:08.470 --> 28:10.730]  It's just buns. Those are just buns.
[28:11.110 --> 28:14.790]  I think you screwed yourself by throwing off your bun to me.
[28:15.310 --> 28:18.690]  I mean, you can't just eat buns with a bun inside. That's gotta be gross.
[28:18.970 --> 28:23.750]  No, I didn't. I never made a bun burger. That was just stacking. That was trying to make a
[28:23.750 --> 28:26.930]  nice picture to show what I had left. That was it.
[28:27.250 --> 28:31.070]  And then there's two... it looks like two halves of two different burgers.
[28:31.550 --> 28:33.590]  Yeah, it's a mess.
[28:33.730 --> 28:36.430]  I can't finish this one, but I'll eat the next half of the next one.
[28:36.990 --> 28:40.750]  Honestly, yes. Because when you look at a bunch of burgers and they're all full,
[28:40.830 --> 28:44.270]  it seems intimidating. But I was like, if I can make these all halves,
[28:44.290 --> 28:47.530]  this is going to seem a lot easier. So I just started eating multiple burgers.
[28:47.950 --> 28:51.290]  God, you are all about the mind games played on yourself. I love it.
[28:51.450 --> 28:56.670]  It's just getting yourself over the edge. And I couldn't do it. But I went all the way down.
[28:57.350 --> 28:59.730]  What did you do with the leftover burgers?
[28:59.730 --> 29:02.110]  I just got rid of the final six.
[29:02.270 --> 29:03.290]  You just threw them away?
[29:03.490 --> 29:07.270]  I don't think I'll eat another burger in 2020. It was a rough one.
[29:07.470 --> 29:11.330]  You didn't think to go downstairs and give them to your girlfriend in the alley, maybe?
[29:11.590 --> 29:13.790]  No, no, I don't know.
[29:14.010 --> 29:16.490]  Those buns look like they could soak up a lot of piss.
[29:17.170 --> 29:17.570]  God.
[29:19.670 --> 29:20.950]  I feel very forced.
[29:21.670 --> 29:23.890]  Krampus doesn't do that.
[29:26.490 --> 29:32.430]  Wow. Okay, so another failure, but impressively close that time.
[29:32.770 --> 29:34.470]  I did way better than last time.
[29:34.670 --> 29:36.950]  Yeah, you were like two thirds if that last time.
[29:37.050 --> 29:39.330]  So next time, next time you're going to do it.
[29:39.350 --> 29:42.070]  No, no, it's not. No, I can't.
[29:42.290 --> 29:47.470]  I think we've finally broken you. It's out of your system. I don't think you have burger confidence.
[29:48.030 --> 29:53.290]  I don't. I've lost my burger confidence because the first time I made enough errors where I thought
[29:53.290 --> 29:57.810]  I could make corrections and I made those corrections. And if I can't get through the meat,
[29:57.870 --> 30:00.510]  then I can't get through the buns. So this is not...
[30:01.750 --> 30:06.190]  You're a perennial loser when it comes to burger and applesauce competitions.
[30:06.770 --> 30:10.910]  I'm proud of one of those. But yeah, that is factually correct.
[30:12.150 --> 30:12.470]  Huh.
[30:12.890 --> 30:14.710]  What do you owe Gav now? What was the bet for?
[30:15.090 --> 30:15.810]  Oh boy.
[30:16.090 --> 30:18.630]  It was going to be... I was going to have to pay him a hundred, but I think...
[30:18.630 --> 30:20.790]  I think... No, I think it was a hundred both ways.
[30:20.790 --> 30:24.510]  I think I'm down. I think I'm down 150 to you now.
[30:26.130 --> 30:33.690]  Which, I don't know, puts me in a tough spot and kind of forced to make some moves here.
[30:34.790 --> 30:39.230]  You know, I've tried to reach out to the Rooster Teeth store. They are ignoring me.
[30:39.650 --> 30:43.930]  They have avoided all attempts at reaching out. They're ignoring everything I said.
[30:43.950 --> 30:46.950]  Are you trying to sell your hats to Rooster Teeth to pay the debt?
[30:46.950 --> 30:55.150]  Well, hear me out, Gavin. I tried. I tried to go a clean route. I wanted to do this the right way.
[30:55.450 --> 31:00.890]  I threatened it in the past. Didn't want to do it. The bootleg store is now on the menu.
[31:01.290 --> 31:01.690]  Oh no.
[31:01.970 --> 31:07.410]  It's possible. It's a possible thing. I don't want to do this. I've reached out to the store.
[31:07.490 --> 31:14.810]  Maybe something will happen. But the bootleg store is now in existence.
[31:14.810 --> 31:17.830]  It's not up up yet, but it's up.
[31:18.030 --> 31:19.190]  It's like pre-up.
[31:19.370 --> 31:26.870]  I've made steps. I've officially made not the roosterteethstore.com because I do not want to
[31:26.870 --> 31:34.590]  get in trouble. This is not the Rooster Teeth store. This is my store that has nothing to do
[31:34.590 --> 31:35.290]  with Rooster Teeth.
[31:35.770 --> 31:43.710]  I'm worried that your legal representation, I assume, Rooster Teeth, will have to sue itself.
[31:44.130 --> 31:46.250]  No, this is a totally different thing.
[31:46.690 --> 31:49.550]  Let me look at the site. If it's up, let me look at the site.
[31:49.830 --> 31:54.090]  It's completely up. It's very navigatable. You navigate it, look at the prices,
[31:54.230 --> 31:57.230]  look at the products. Listen, we've expanded beyond hats.
[31:57.810 --> 31:59.410]  Some shit from Kansas.
[31:59.830 --> 32:05.070]  Well, I guess I'm like 90% sure I'm okay, but there's a 10% chance this is not okay,
[32:05.250 --> 32:07.910]  and I need a fall guy. Everyone needs a good fall guy.
[32:07.950 --> 32:13.290]  You've got additional merch. You've got two hats. You've got a flask.
[32:13.290 --> 32:16.250]  You've just drawn on these, and you're selling your art.
[32:16.490 --> 32:17.650]  You're a guy looking up.
[32:17.850 --> 32:19.470]  It's an original art piece.
[32:19.670 --> 32:20.870]  For a million dollars?
[32:21.390 --> 32:22.830]  What is the address to the store?
[32:23.730 --> 32:24.130]  Ourselves.
[32:25.070 --> 32:25.610]  God damn it.
[32:25.630 --> 32:27.830]  I don't think so. This is not the Rooster Teeth store.
[32:30.230 --> 32:32.750]  Which Geoff is that? Is that Foxworthy?
[32:33.670 --> 32:36.010]  We're in talks with a variety of Geoffs right now.
[32:36.010 --> 32:39.530]  Okay, so we'll get sued by him as well. Let me see. What other pages will we get in trouble
[32:39.530 --> 32:40.070]  over for this?
[32:44.430 --> 32:46.050]  About us, it says,
[32:47.170 --> 32:50.350]  Welcome. Why do you want to know so much about this legal operation?
[32:50.850 --> 32:54.530]  You a cop? Mind your business. Don't tell me your problems.
[32:54.970 --> 32:56.870]  It's a really aggressive store.
[32:57.330 --> 33:01.150]  It's a very open store that people could look at.
[33:02.450 --> 33:06.230]  Well, anyone who would click that would be a cop, so I just wanted to let them know.
[33:06.370 --> 33:09.410]  Contact us is tweeting to Eric Bador.
[33:09.910 --> 33:10.350]  Wow.
[33:10.950 --> 33:15.510]  Well, you'd want to know. I know one thing about Eric. He loves hearing people's opinions.
[33:15.630 --> 33:17.150]  Free shipping on no orders.
[33:19.610 --> 33:20.990]  For a small operation.
[33:21.490 --> 33:24.010]  You've got the one listed in red, but the description says,
[33:24.210 --> 33:25.930]  We ain't selling this shit in red.
[33:27.630 --> 33:30.330]  Well, because people are going to want to know where the hat is. They're going to say,
[33:30.370 --> 33:34.090]  I want the red hat, and I just need to make a page to say we're not selling it in red.
[33:34.270 --> 33:35.670]  The cart doesn't work.
[33:35.970 --> 33:36.310]  The what?
[33:36.970 --> 33:39.270]  I can't add anything to my cart. Pants and leg.
[33:39.270 --> 33:43.250]  Yeah, well, I don't want to actually... we're still... this is a threat.
[33:43.410 --> 33:46.410]  This is the phase one threat. I'm not actually selling anything on this.
[33:47.810 --> 33:51.270]  I'm drawing a line in the sand. I don't want to cross that fucking line.
[33:51.730 --> 33:54.610]  It has an online help thing. What is this?
[33:55.430 --> 33:58.330]  What happens if I put... it's got like a chat thing in the bottom right.
[33:58.870 --> 34:00.250]  Where does that go to, Andrew?
[34:00.770 --> 34:01.770]  Might go to Eric's Twitter.
[34:04.390 --> 34:07.450]  How many Easter eggs are on this fucking store?
[34:07.450 --> 34:09.930]  Name Gavin Free.
[34:10.550 --> 34:13.710]  But yeah, I mean, I don't want to do this. I had the Rooster Teeth store very quiet.
[34:14.150 --> 34:16.110]  I know they see me. I know they see me.
[34:16.270 --> 34:17.130]  This'll wake them up.
[34:17.390 --> 34:24.050]  Yeah. I think the best part about that red fucking Russian fuck hat is the giant
[34:24.510 --> 34:28.550]  stain on the middle of the bill. I can't stop looking at it. What is that stain?
[34:29.130 --> 34:32.370]  I don't know what that is. It's a great question. I'll look into that.
[34:32.670 --> 34:35.370]  So do you think this will get the ball rolling on these hats?
[34:36.330 --> 34:41.110]  I mean, in your defense, we've not heard anything from whether they're making the hats or not.
[34:41.230 --> 34:42.090]  I've not heard anything.
[34:42.350 --> 34:42.570]  Eric?
[34:42.710 --> 34:43.510]  Haven't heard a word.
[34:43.990 --> 34:47.210]  I also have asked about the hats and have not received word on the hats.
[34:47.470 --> 34:48.830]  Sounds like Eric's checking up on it.
[34:49.050 --> 34:51.150]  You know, my bet, my favorite part about this whole deal, Gav,
[34:51.450 --> 34:55.630]  is that Eric is the producer of this show, so this is all his fault. Or problem.
[34:55.710 --> 34:56.630]  Yeah, and problem, yeah.
[34:57.710 --> 34:58.270]  There's no problem.
[34:58.270 --> 34:59.730]  Andrew and I are just talent, man.
[35:00.350 --> 35:04.950]  Yeah, so are my social handles and people can get a hold of me directly through the website I
[35:04.950 --> 35:06.890]  didn't make. It's really interesting stuff.
[35:07.030 --> 35:12.490]  This is incredible, Andrew. You've really put everyone into a sticky situation.
[35:12.810 --> 35:14.270]  And by everyone, I mean Eric.
[35:14.290 --> 35:15.870]  Andrew, you've outfucked yourself.
[35:17.510 --> 35:20.450]  I don't know what that means, but I think this is a great play.
[35:20.630 --> 35:21.670]  It turns out the biggest...
[35:21.670 --> 35:22.170]  It's a show of force.
[35:22.430 --> 35:26.690]  The biggest fuckface so far is Rooster Teeth allowing Andrew to be in Rooster Teeth content.
[35:27.030 --> 35:29.750]  I just found out Eric Baudour has Instagram. How about that?
[35:30.070 --> 35:30.570]  There you go.
[35:31.350 --> 35:32.070]  Sign in.
[35:32.130 --> 35:33.250]  It's all pictures of cats.
[35:33.650 --> 35:34.810]  I'm blown away by that website.
[35:35.390 --> 35:37.630]  It's a great site. I don't want to use it.
[35:37.910 --> 35:39.270]  I don't want to use it.
[35:39.270 --> 35:41.310]  I mean, you've used it. It's there now.
[35:41.490 --> 35:43.390]  I made it. I don't want to use it.
[35:43.730 --> 35:48.010]  I love the fucking manual for the home embroidery machine behind the hat.
[35:49.770 --> 35:52.730]  It was made by a skilled user.
[35:53.250 --> 35:54.650]  They know everything about hats.
[35:54.650 --> 35:56.650]  Did they ever tell you what the problem with the machine was?
[35:58.750 --> 36:02.090]  It was like a screw was loose or something.
[36:02.090 --> 36:05.070]  It was like a mechanical issue.
[36:06.210 --> 36:07.690]  That's a hell of a loose screw.
[36:08.150 --> 36:13.410]  It is. It created some masterpieces that I feel like should be recognized.
[36:13.550 --> 36:15.010]  Not in a museum, but recognized.
[36:15.390 --> 36:16.650]  Geoff, what are your thoughts on this?
[36:17.030 --> 36:19.030]  I'm just... can I be honest with you, Gav?
[36:19.310 --> 36:19.550]  Yeah.
[36:19.830 --> 36:20.730]  I'm just glad I'm not Eric.
[36:21.330 --> 36:21.870]  Me too, man.
[36:22.330 --> 36:25.650]  I can edit the site. I can make adjustments.
[36:25.650 --> 36:31.110]  I have no... I have no... I am just a talent on this show.
[36:31.590 --> 36:35.470]  So that sounds like a whole thing for Eric and the legal department.
[36:36.790 --> 36:38.650]  Andrew's legal representation.
[36:39.130 --> 36:44.610]  It would be funny if the show went under because it sued itself.
[36:44.850 --> 36:46.250]  Like that... I don't think that's happened.
[36:50.110 --> 36:52.690]  No, I don't think it has either. I'm trying to think.
[36:54.150 --> 36:56.190]  I don't think there's a reason to sue, though.
[36:56.270 --> 36:58.630]  This is very clearly not the Rooster Teeth store.
[36:58.870 --> 37:01.710]  That's true. It's true. He's not...
[37:01.710 --> 37:05.190]  It couldn't be more clear. Not the roosterteethstore.com.
[37:05.270 --> 37:08.050]  This is not... If you want the Rooster Teeth store, don't go here.
[37:09.190 --> 37:09.910]  That's fair.
[37:10.950 --> 37:14.590]  I mean, Elon Musk made not a flamethrower, and that seems to work.
[37:14.990 --> 37:17.050]  Hey, I'm not trying to light people on fire.
[37:17.390 --> 37:17.790]  That's true.
[37:17.890 --> 37:18.590]  I'm just trying to sell hats.
[37:18.990 --> 37:21.770]  Well, I mean, some would argue that these hats are fire.
[37:21.770 --> 37:23.350]  I don't...
[37:25.170 --> 37:26.970]  Come on, that was on clear!
[37:27.530 --> 37:28.370]  That was on clear.
[37:28.670 --> 37:29.710]  Thank you very much.
[37:29.930 --> 37:31.750]  That's true. I won't argue that.
[37:33.490 --> 37:35.710]  Do you guys have any suggestions for the store?
[37:36.710 --> 37:38.130]  Gavin brought up a great point.
[37:38.230 --> 37:39.950]  Gavin, I don't think you and I are allowed to comment.
[37:40.930 --> 37:42.210]  Yeah, I'd probably stay out of it.
[37:42.490 --> 37:43.610]  Oh, maybe I could...
[37:43.730 --> 37:46.810]  Product suggestion. I mean, I see there's five products.
[37:48.910 --> 37:53.250]  A sixth one might be a fire extinguisher with the F*** Face logo on it.
[37:54.010 --> 37:55.530]  Can I just sell a boring company?
[37:55.690 --> 37:57.730]  Oh, then I wouldn't have a pop filter holder.
[38:00.190 --> 38:01.850]  I don't know if that's worth it.
[38:02.210 --> 38:06.570]  Can we settle on you firing the fire extinguisher if we make it to 52 episodes?
[38:06.890 --> 38:08.070]  If we make it to...
[38:08.810 --> 38:10.010]  Well, what are the rules?
[38:10.010 --> 38:13.550]  You just... like after a year of F*** Facing,
[38:14.430 --> 38:16.890]  you fire the fire extinguisher off, you send it off,
[38:17.390 --> 38:19.530]  and then we'll replace it with a mic stand.
[38:20.250 --> 38:22.670]  Oh, I just got an email. Not theroosterteastore.com.
[38:22.730 --> 38:23.750]  Did someone send me a message?
[38:24.270 --> 38:26.190]  That went to you? Yeah, I filled out a little...
[38:27.510 --> 38:28.910]  Yeah, let's see what this says.
[38:29.650 --> 38:32.150]  Eric, question mark. No, it wasn't Eric. I just said that.
[38:32.270 --> 38:33.070]  That was just a joke.
[38:33.170 --> 38:35.470]  I didn't even know it directed to me, though. That's cool.
[38:35.650 --> 38:37.770]  That's cool. You should forward those to Eric, I assume.
[38:37.770 --> 38:38.310]  Yeah, you should.
[38:38.570 --> 38:39.490]  That's a great idea.
[38:39.490 --> 38:40.970]  Eric, what's your email?
[38:41.350 --> 38:44.250]  Eric, quickly make a dummy email address for your own sake.
[38:44.530 --> 38:50.270]  Yeah, my email, you can email me at jeffatroosterteeth.com.
[38:50.550 --> 38:52.590]  You can send all your emails there.
[38:53.050 --> 38:54.690]  Don't forget to spell it with a J!
[38:57.310 --> 38:58.350]  jeff.foxworthyatroosterteeth.com
[38:58.350 --> 38:59.550]  Just send it to you, Eric.
[39:00.570 --> 39:01.910]  I don't want it.
[39:03.390 --> 39:05.630]  Why not? It was Gavin who had a question.
[39:05.650 --> 39:06.450]  Why not?
[39:06.730 --> 39:07.630]  Gavin had a question.
[39:07.630 --> 39:10.370]  Well, maybe, Gavin, you should just ask him the question while he's here.
[39:10.730 --> 39:11.770]  And the question was just Eric.
[39:12.130 --> 39:15.250]  Yeah, but that's obviously leading to a broader question.
[39:15.450 --> 39:17.090]  It's like, hey, Eric, is this you?
[39:17.490 --> 39:19.610]  And no one's just like, oh, yeah, OK, cool, it's you.
[39:19.950 --> 39:21.070]  There's always a follow-up.
[39:21.410 --> 39:25.030]  I feel like Andrew is becoming more and more dangerous as each week goes on.
[39:25.210 --> 39:27.450]  I fucking love this. I love it.
[39:27.530 --> 39:29.190]  I feel like it's getting away from us.
[39:30.030 --> 39:31.230]  Why is this dangerous?
[39:31.790 --> 39:37.470]  Geoff has deemed him Krampus, and it's really taken, it's become,
[39:38.250 --> 39:43.270]  it's reached critical mass and is now actually becoming a huge detriment to the product,
[39:43.550 --> 39:44.990]  which I think is perfect.
[39:45.470 --> 39:47.310]  I don't understand why this is dangerous.
[39:47.330 --> 39:48.630]  I thought we'd be aligned in this.
[39:48.710 --> 39:50.090]  I thought we'd all agree this is great.
[39:50.650 --> 39:51.770]  I'm fighting for us.
[39:51.990 --> 39:53.610]  This is a fight for all of us.
[39:53.990 --> 39:56.750]  But the thing is, is you're fighting us for us.
[39:56.750 --> 40:01.640]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[40:01.900 --> 40:05.180]  Well, sometimes the left brain doesn't agree with the right brain.
[40:05.300 --> 40:06.220]  But it's all one unit.
[40:06.320 --> 40:09.280]  I'm trying to get the other side to see the light.
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.380]  It's all I'm trying to do.
[40:10.580 --> 40:13.000]  The ripped corpus callosum of podcasts.
[40:13.520 --> 40:16.260]  I got to be honest, I don't understand that reference.
[40:16.660 --> 40:17.420]  Yeah, I had no idea.
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.580]  Isn't that the thing that links both sides of the brain and they snip them if you're schizophrenic?
[40:21.600 --> 40:22.360]  All right, shut up.
[40:22.460 --> 40:22.960]  Nobody cares.
[40:23.240 --> 40:25.040]  If it's not Flintstones kids, I don't know.
[40:25.300 --> 40:26.340]  Oh, Jesus.
[40:26.340 --> 40:29.580]  I didn't sign up for science class, Poindexter.
[40:30.220 --> 40:31.100]  Fucking hell.
[40:31.960 --> 40:33.060]  It's not Beakman's world.
[40:34.760 --> 40:35.200]  Oh.
[40:37.740 --> 40:38.620]  Oh, dear.
[40:39.060 --> 40:39.280]  Damn.
[40:39.380 --> 40:39.980]  That went great.
[40:40.100 --> 40:42.440]  I think, uh, I appreciate the support of this store.
[40:42.680 --> 40:44.320]  And I'm glad you guys are with me all the way.
[40:44.540 --> 40:47.020]  I can, I am, I think it's highly entertaining.
[40:47.240 --> 40:47.800]  I'll say that.
[40:48.460 --> 40:52.760]  And all of the fallout and ramifications to come will also be highly entertaining.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.180]  At least for two of us.
[40:54.440 --> 40:55.660]  What fallout?
[40:56.140 --> 40:57.080]  I don't know.
[40:57.500 --> 40:58.180]  There will be none.
[40:58.340 --> 41:00.260]  Can't wait to tune in to find out, though.
[41:00.760 --> 41:05.980]  Are we doing, is there any, um, I feel like we've somehow got an entire episode out of
[41:05.980 --> 41:08.440]  wacky races and, uh, a huge legal issue.
[41:08.600 --> 41:09.780]  And we don't, we done burgers.
[41:09.940 --> 41:10.440]  That's a good point.
[41:10.620 --> 41:11.620]  Yeah, burgers, burgers, burgers.
[41:12.020 --> 41:12.660]  I mean, that's pretty good.
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.820]  I feel like there's nothing sort of, uh, teed up for the next episode.
[41:16.860 --> 41:19.440]  But, you know, this doesn't always have to be something for next time.
[41:19.440 --> 41:20.700]  What do you mean not teed?
[41:20.720 --> 41:22.360]  Like, this is all within a week.
[41:22.760 --> 41:22.880]  Yeah.
[41:22.880 --> 41:23.880]  We don't need things.
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.160]  It's just, there's nothing that you're going to stuff your face with in the next week.
[41:27.280 --> 41:30.200]  I basically got nothing to talk to you about in the next week.
[41:30.500 --> 41:31.680]  Which makes me a little bit sad.
[41:32.180 --> 41:32.880]  That's not true.
[41:33.220 --> 41:37.220]  I still have notes on my thing for things I could talk about that happened this week.
[41:37.320 --> 41:39.080]  Well, Eric's been trying to get us to end this one for...
[41:40.060 --> 41:40.600]  Oh, has he?
[41:40.840 --> 41:41.200]  Yeah.
[41:41.700 --> 41:41.920]  Yeah.
[41:42.360 --> 41:45.080]  He's sort of time checking us because the last one went long.
[41:45.660 --> 41:46.140]  Oh, yeah.
[41:46.200 --> 41:48.340]  I have a hundred dollar Garfield bet right now.
[41:48.700 --> 41:50.140]  Ooh, that's a touch on that.
[41:50.240 --> 41:52.340]  That's a great thing to tease for next episode, I guess.
[41:52.340 --> 41:55.640]  How many hundred dollars are you going to lose at the same time?
[41:55.720 --> 41:57.120]  I'm not going to lose that one.
[41:57.240 --> 41:58.700]  I'm the Garfield king.
[41:58.820 --> 41:59.920]  That one isn't happening.
[42:00.260 --> 42:01.980]  My throne is secured, Gavin.
[42:02.360 --> 42:03.280]  You don't need to worry about that.
[42:03.280 --> 42:04.000]  Is that for next time?
[42:04.040 --> 42:05.560]  Or are you going to tell us what it's about?
[42:06.160 --> 42:07.000]  Are we ending?
[42:07.420 --> 42:09.720]  This felt like a weird opening and a weird ending.
[42:09.880 --> 42:10.860]  Yeah, it sounds like...
[42:11.260 --> 42:14.100]  Why don't you just tell us what the Garfield bet is?
[42:14.240 --> 42:15.020]  And that's how we'll close.
[42:16.720 --> 42:18.280]  No, now this is like...
[42:18.280 --> 42:19.900]  That just took the air out of the whole thing.
[42:20.480 --> 42:21.640]  This is like a downer now.
[42:21.640 --> 42:22.660]  Why is it a downer?
[42:23.100 --> 42:24.380]  It feels like a forced thing.
[42:24.520 --> 42:28.200]  Like, oh, I guess if you're going to bring it up, you might as well talk about it.
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.500]  But we should have closed it.
[42:29.860 --> 42:31.460]  Oh, is that how I presented it to you?
[42:31.500 --> 42:31.880]  I'm sorry.
[42:31.900 --> 42:33.200]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[42:33.320 --> 42:34.340]  It does feel like a downer.
[42:34.400 --> 42:35.560]  I'm sad now.
[42:36.480 --> 42:37.860]  The tone of that was bad.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.160]  I don't think we should end, sadly.
[42:39.240 --> 42:40.420]  I was just trying to placate you.
[42:41.360 --> 42:42.540]  Okay, how about...
[42:42.540 --> 42:42.820]  Hold on.
[42:43.060 --> 42:43.440]  Let me see.
[42:44.440 --> 42:46.620]  That was a whole crazy thing.
[42:46.820 --> 42:49.320]  What with the hamburger and the hats and stuff.
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.520]  I wish that was...
[42:50.520 --> 42:51.560]  I feel like we're close.
[42:51.560 --> 42:52.760]  To having a really good episode.
[42:52.840 --> 42:58.160]  But if we had one more fantastic story to just take us over the edge, that would be awesome.
[42:58.420 --> 42:59.540]  I'm all tapped out, though.
[42:59.640 --> 43:01.880]  Gavin, Andrew, do you have anything?
[43:02.400 --> 43:03.540]  You know, I actually had something.
[43:03.840 --> 43:06.780]  But this episode is going to air by the time it's over.
[43:06.860 --> 43:10.600]  So maybe it would make more sense for me to talk about it next week when it's ended.
[43:11.080 --> 43:11.940]  Instead of this week.
[43:11.940 --> 43:13.160]  Well, now you made it a downer.
[43:14.100 --> 43:14.500]  Because...
[43:14.500 --> 43:17.520]  Well, no, I'm just saying that the bet doesn't end until next week.
[43:17.600 --> 43:19.220]  This will air two weeks from now.
[43:19.420 --> 43:20.040]  It ends on...
[43:20.040 --> 43:21.360]  My bet ends on Tuesday.
[43:21.660 --> 43:25.620]  Geoff just dug us out the downer hole and you dumped a chocolate donut.
[43:25.640 --> 43:26.960]  No, this isn't a downer.
[43:27.300 --> 43:28.800]  I fucking hate you guys.
[43:29.360 --> 43:30.000]  Okay, let me...
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  Like and subscribe.
[43:31.860 --> 43:32.800]  Let me pivot this.
[43:32.900 --> 43:33.380]  No, don't...
[43:33.380 --> 43:34.260]  Send us a review.
[43:34.780 --> 43:35.360]  Like and...
[43:35.360 --> 43:36.720]  Yes, all of those things.
[43:36.840 --> 43:37.580]  Send us a review.
[43:37.620 --> 43:38.620]  Hold your horses for a second.
[43:38.920 --> 43:39.800]  I don't want the review.
[43:40.040 --> 43:40.120]  Hold your horses.
[43:41.240 --> 43:42.460]  I do have something I could say.
[43:42.600 --> 43:43.000]  I tweeted...
[43:43.000 --> 43:43.600]  Okay, okay.
[43:43.700 --> 43:44.380]  We'll fucking say it.
[43:45.100 --> 43:45.900]  I'm trying to.
[43:45.960 --> 43:46.920]  You keep interrupting me.
[43:48.120 --> 43:50.840]  I tweeted out my Judge Judy prank number.
[43:51.020 --> 43:51.600]  Hold on a second.
[43:51.980 --> 43:52.200]  It's a public number now.
[43:52.200 --> 43:52.780]  Hold on a second.
[43:52.880 --> 43:53.980]  Before you go any further.
[43:54.300 --> 43:55.100]  How's the mood?
[43:55.220 --> 43:57.240]  Do you feel emboldened to continue the story?
[43:57.560 --> 43:58.020]  Do we need to...
[43:58.020 --> 43:59.440]  Yeah, I feel like this is a good mood.
[43:59.560 --> 44:01.760]  I feel pretty good about how things are at this current moment.
[44:01.760 --> 44:02.620]  By all means, sir.
[44:02.680 --> 44:03.500]  Please proceed.
[44:03.680 --> 44:06.580]  I posted the Judge Judy phone number and I've been getting calls.
[44:06.720 --> 44:07.620]  I've been talking to people.
[44:07.900 --> 44:09.540]  So you gave the internet a phone number.
[44:10.280 --> 44:11.660]  Does the phone ever stop ringing?
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.400]  Uh, I've gotten a little over a hundred calls, I'd say, since I did it.
[44:16.400 --> 44:18.000]  And most of them I haven't.
[44:18.240 --> 44:20.180]  I was doing this really fun thing last night.
[44:21.160 --> 44:23.180]  Uh, Geoff, since you love fun, let's act this out.
[44:23.580 --> 44:27.460]  Call the number, uh, not expecting anyone to pick up.
[44:27.640 --> 44:28.420]  I'll show you what I was doing.
[44:28.800 --> 44:29.080]  Okay.
[44:31.600 --> 44:33.060]  I'll have to look up that...
[44:33.060 --> 44:33.800]  Text me the number.
[44:34.380 --> 44:34.880]  No, it's fine.
[44:34.920 --> 44:35.520]  That's too much work.
[44:35.680 --> 44:36.460]  So Geoff calls.
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.060]  I let it ring.
[44:38.260 --> 44:38.600]  Do the bit.
[44:39.240 --> 44:40.060]  But I don't...
[44:40.060 --> 44:42.180]  The bit won't translate because we won't hear the rings.
[44:42.340 --> 44:42.780]  It doesn't...
[44:42.780 --> 44:45.160]  Why didn't you tell us to do the bit?
[44:45.160 --> 44:47.740]  No, you're gonna do the bit.
[44:48.880 --> 44:50.180]  No, this is not my fault.
[44:50.280 --> 44:50.800]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[44:50.800 --> 44:52.320]  You're focusing on the wrong part of the bit.
[44:52.740 --> 44:53.100]  Ring!
[44:53.620 --> 44:54.440]  There we go, okay.
[44:54.520 --> 44:57.960]  So I let it ring a few times so they think like, oh, maybe it'll be a voice mail.
[44:58.360 --> 44:59.520]  And then I'll answer.
[45:00.300 --> 45:01.020]  I'll answer.
[45:01.100 --> 45:03.220]  So I answer the call and then I say,
[45:03.560 --> 45:06.400]  Hi, you've reached Andrew Panton's Judge Judy prank line.
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.220]  This is a number I bought through Skype, so I don't know if it beeps at the end of a message.
[45:11.400 --> 45:13.080]  But, uh, feel free to leave me one.
[45:13.260 --> 45:13.840]  Have a great day.
[45:14.220 --> 45:16.100]  Okay, so should I leave the message now?
[45:16.600 --> 45:19.920]  And then you leave the message because they think that's a voice recording.
[45:19.940 --> 45:20.960]  So then you would talk.
[45:21.340 --> 45:26.300]  Yeah, uh, this is, uh, this is your, uh, this is your real dad.
[45:26.420 --> 45:27.840]  I'm calling to get in touch with you.
[45:27.960 --> 45:29.520]  Your entire life has been a lie.
[45:30.060 --> 45:31.340]  If you could call me back.
[45:31.420 --> 45:36.280]  My number is, uh, 5555556.
[45:36.900 --> 45:38.560]  I mean, hey, hey, real dad.
[45:38.860 --> 45:39.800]  Yeah, no, I hung up.
[45:39.820 --> 45:40.660]  How's it going, real dad?
[45:40.760 --> 45:41.900]  Sorry, I hung up.
[45:42.480 --> 45:44.480]  This isn't, that actually happened once.
[45:44.960 --> 45:46.440]  That actually, it did happen once.
[45:46.500 --> 45:47.340]  I waited too long.
[45:47.860 --> 45:49.920]  As soon as I jumped back in, they hung up.
[45:50.020 --> 45:54.680]  So you've been just chiming in, in what they think is a voicemail and scaring the shit out of people.
[45:54.700 --> 45:55.060]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.700]  I open as a voicemail and then I'll wait for a good time to jump into the conversation.
[45:59.880 --> 46:00.800]  And I'll be like, what's up?
[46:01.120 --> 46:01.960]  And I did.
[46:02.060 --> 46:03.400]  Oh, I got the first guy.
[46:03.440 --> 46:04.200]  I got so good.
[46:04.660 --> 46:07.280]  He started talking and I said, what's up?
[46:07.320 --> 46:07.860]  And he's like, what?
[46:08.720 --> 46:10.300]  And I said, I'm just messing with you.
[46:10.340 --> 46:11.360]  This is still a voicemail.
[46:11.360 --> 46:14.300]  Leave your message after the beep.
[46:14.960 --> 46:16.740]  And then he said, like, what?
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.420]  Did he do it over?
[46:20.260 --> 46:22.220]  So I was just calling to let you know.
[46:22.540 --> 46:25.220]  And then I jumped back in and said, I'm still doing the voicemail.
[46:25.520 --> 46:26.400]  Leave a message.
[46:26.720 --> 46:28.380]  Seriously, after the beep, there's going to be a beep.
[46:28.420 --> 46:28.900]  Wait for the beep.
[46:29.300 --> 46:30.460]  We did it three times.
[46:30.560 --> 46:31.820]  I reset him three times.
[46:31.940 --> 46:35.200]  And by the fourth time, he still didn't know if it was somehow recording.
[46:35.460 --> 46:36.480]  He's like, I don't understand.
[46:36.600 --> 46:37.300]  Is this real?
[46:37.740 --> 46:39.260]  Is this a real conversation?
[46:39.260 --> 46:43.700]  Did you eventually tell him, like, hey, it was me the whole time?
[46:44.060 --> 46:44.580]  Yeah, no.
[46:44.640 --> 46:45.860]  Then we had a normal conversation.
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.380]  But it took a while for him to accept the fact that I wasn't fucking with him.
[46:49.800 --> 46:50.780]  A, that's hilarious.
[46:51.080 --> 46:53.660]  And B, did you record any of that?
[46:54.100 --> 46:54.400]  No.
[46:54.900 --> 46:55.440]  Why would I?
[46:55.540 --> 46:56.380]  How would I do that?
[46:57.260 --> 46:58.340]  How would I record that?
[46:58.760 --> 46:59.820]  How would you record this?
[47:00.320 --> 47:02.040]  Well, but that's through...
[47:02.040 --> 47:03.980]  Well, I record...
[47:03.980 --> 47:07.860]  Well, it would have been great for the podcast if we could have played a couple of those.
[47:07.860 --> 47:09.940]  You didn't even want to fucking hear the story.
[47:09.940 --> 47:10.780]  No, I did!
[47:14.280 --> 47:15.080]  I'm serious.
[47:15.300 --> 47:16.420]  Okay, I can record these.
[47:16.520 --> 47:16.940]  I just didn't...
[47:17.460 --> 47:19.060]  If I'm calling...
[47:19.060 --> 47:21.320]  Listen, you need to get their permission.
[47:21.940 --> 47:23.200]  Yeah, you need to get a release from everyone.
[47:23.300 --> 47:24.140]  I would get a release.
[47:24.760 --> 47:25.920]  But if I just said...
[47:25.920 --> 47:26.700]  Well, wait, do I need a...
[47:26.700 --> 47:28.200]  Is a verbal release good enough?
[47:28.400 --> 47:30.560]  Eric will work it out with you behind the scenes.
[47:30.680 --> 47:31.780]  He likes to do that kind of stuff.
[47:32.120 --> 47:33.740]  Eric, is a verbal release good enough?
[47:33.880 --> 47:35.120]  I'll be honest, I feel like...
[47:35.120 --> 47:35.980]  A verbal release will do.
[47:35.980 --> 47:38.440]  I feel like face needs its own lawyer.
[47:39.920 --> 47:41.040]  We don't need a lawyer.
[47:41.180 --> 47:43.680]  Everything has been above bar board.
[47:43.820 --> 47:44.860]  What's this expression?
[47:46.120 --> 47:46.960]  Above the bar.
[47:47.180 --> 47:48.400]  Everything's above William Barr.
[47:48.720 --> 47:50.580]  You've been setting the board real low, Andrew.
[47:50.960 --> 47:52.220]  I set the bar real low.
[47:52.460 --> 47:55.020]  But everything I do above it is legal.
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.600]  It's all good.
[47:57.340 --> 47:58.600]  See, I've been talking to people.
[47:58.680 --> 47:59.120]  It's been great.
[47:59.740 --> 48:03.920]  Sometimes people say things that I don't think they'd say if they thought they were talking to a person.
[48:03.920 --> 48:06.860]  Maybe if you put a blanket disclaimer in the tweet,
[48:07.380 --> 48:10.420]  and maybe a small message up front when they call saying,
[48:10.540 --> 48:11.440]  hey, this might be recorded.
[48:11.640 --> 48:12.820]  Maybe that is a release.
[48:13.220 --> 48:16.040]  I think they need more awareness than that.
[48:17.480 --> 48:19.720]  I think as long as I end the call with like,
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.800]  hey, do you mind if this gets maybe used?
[48:22.200 --> 48:23.000]  And they say, sure.
[48:23.360 --> 48:24.920]  I still don't know how to record it, though.
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.640]  Read up however they do it on the Howard Stern show for Sal and Richard do prank calls.
[48:29.640 --> 48:31.180]  Oh, I'm sure I have the same tech they do.
[48:31.520 --> 48:34.080]  No, no, not for the tech.
[48:34.320 --> 48:37.960]  More of like how they they because they solicit approval.
[48:38.100 --> 48:39.600]  All that stuff is fake.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.960]  Now, I think for prank calls on radio, I think you need to do it ahead of time.
[48:43.120 --> 48:44.360]  I don't think any of that stuff is real.
[48:44.620 --> 48:48.260]  Well, something to something to research for sure.
[48:48.760 --> 48:49.260]  I'd agree.
[48:50.220 --> 48:51.140]  Are we at the end now?
[48:51.180 --> 48:52.100]  Is this officially the end?
[48:52.240 --> 48:53.720]  I think you got us there.
[48:53.780 --> 48:56.000]  Yeah, I think I think how long have you been recording?
[48:56.560 --> 48:58.740]  Eric, you don't like our eight outros.
[48:59.280 --> 48:59.920]  You have a problem with.
[49:00.020 --> 49:01.160]  Well, wait, what are we supposed to say?
[49:01.700 --> 49:05.820]  If he doesn't like that intro, he's definitely not going to like whatever this is as an outro.
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.440]  Oh, he's just a curmudgeon.
[49:07.600 --> 49:09.260]  He's he's he's like he can't.
[49:09.600 --> 49:10.920]  You know, Eric, he's very cool.
[49:11.020 --> 49:13.040]  He's the kind of guy that wears like a denim vest.
[49:13.420 --> 49:15.480]  He and he's a ring guy.
[49:15.640 --> 49:18.620]  He can't say he wants to do it because that's not macho.
[49:18.720 --> 49:19.860]  Eric's very macho, dude.
[49:19.900 --> 49:21.920]  You know, Big Dog's got a hunt and all that.
[49:23.060 --> 49:25.200]  So Big Dog's got a hunt.
[49:25.660 --> 49:27.220]  So so he can't.
[49:27.300 --> 49:28.540]  You got to read through the lines with Eric.
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.140]  You know, he obviously he wants to do the outro.
[49:31.140 --> 49:32.660]  But he's not going to come out and say it.
[49:32.920 --> 49:33.860]  Yeah, you got to read between the bars.
[49:34.440 --> 49:34.560]  Yeah.
[49:34.680 --> 49:36.360]  What are we supposed to say for the outro again?
[49:37.060 --> 49:38.140]  That's just what I want to know.
[49:39.380 --> 49:40.540]  Thanks for listening.
[49:40.920 --> 49:41.660]  Thanks for listening.
[49:41.840 --> 49:43.900]  This is for P*** Face.
[49:44.860 --> 49:47.500]  Do we need to say the name of the show in the outro too?
[49:47.740 --> 49:51.320]  I think it's up to the individual.
[49:51.860 --> 49:58.820]  If you enjoyed the podcast, tweet us hashtag F and we'll we'll see it on Twitter.
[49:59.540 --> 50:04.920]  Oh, and and if you are Bill Ripken, we'd love to have you on.
[50:05.660 --> 50:07.160]  I don't know if we want him on.
[50:07.340 --> 50:07.500]  Do we?
[50:07.860 --> 50:08.380]  I don't know.
[50:08.760 --> 50:08.940]  We could.
[50:09.240 --> 50:10.260]  Well, I'll tell you what, if you're Bill Ripken.
[50:10.280 --> 50:11.500]  I'd like to send him a shirt.
[50:11.680 --> 50:17.180]  If you're Bill Ripken, we'd love to send you a shirt and maybe talk to you if you're if you're
[50:17.180 --> 50:17.660]  interesting.
[50:18.320 --> 50:21.840]  Why don't I just call one of these people and they can do the outro for us?
[50:22.300 --> 50:23.120]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[50:23.180 --> 50:23.440]  Do that.
[50:23.720 --> 50:24.900]  Oh, I'm getting a call right now.
[50:24.900 --> 50:25.700]  Actually, this is perfect.
[50:26.020 --> 50:26.680]  Answer it live.
[50:27.020 --> 50:28.020]  Yeah, I'm going to answer it live right now.
[50:28.020 --> 50:28.880]  I think I get a release.
[50:29.280 --> 50:31.680]  Wait, OK, how do I do it?
[50:31.820 --> 50:32.560]  One second.
[50:33.260 --> 50:34.340]  Oh, I just muted myself.
[50:34.460 --> 50:35.060]  I don't know how.
[50:35.780 --> 50:36.520]  How does.
[50:37.260 --> 50:38.420]  Wait, can you hear me?
[50:38.740 --> 50:41.260]  I've never used this on a phone.
[50:41.460 --> 50:42.360]  Aren't you a millennial?
[50:42.740 --> 50:46.360]  All this is going to do is it's going to end his actual podcast recording.
[50:47.560 --> 50:48.240]  Hey, can you.
[50:48.400 --> 50:49.340]  Hey, how's it going?
[50:50.380 --> 50:52.000]  We're recording a podcast right now.
[50:52.060 --> 50:52.500]  Are you OK?
[50:52.640 --> 50:53.780]  Are you OK to be on this podcast?
[50:54.240 --> 50:55.020]  I would love that.
[50:55.100 --> 50:55.820]  He would love that.
[50:56.060 --> 50:57.080]  What's your first name?
[50:57.920 --> 50:58.320]  Chris.
[50:58.600 --> 51:02.600]  OK, so, Chris, I want you to close our podcast for us if you could.
[51:02.820 --> 51:05.920]  I'm going to give you kind of an explanation of what to say, and then I'll say go.
[51:05.980 --> 51:07.080]  Or then you you take it away.
[51:07.720 --> 51:08.120]  Great.
[51:09.780 --> 51:10.180]  Awesome.
[51:10.380 --> 51:16.060]  OK, so I'm going to need you to tell people to please share the podcast with a friend.
[51:16.400 --> 51:18.220]  Please give it a five star review.
[51:18.800 --> 51:20.160]  And what's the other thing?
[51:20.920 --> 51:22.320]  Thank them for listening.

[51:46.550 --> 51:46.910]  Awesome.
[51:47.030 --> 51:47.690]  Thank you so much.
[51:47.750 --> 51:48.430]  You nailed it, Chris.
[51:48.550 --> 51:50.190]  That was better than we've ever done.
[51:50.430 --> 51:51.290]  Can Chris hear us?
[51:52.610 --> 51:53.410]  Fucking great.
[51:53.710 --> 51:55.050]  No, Chris can't hear you.
[51:55.390 --> 51:57.330]  Would you like to relay a message to Chris?
[51:57.330 --> 52:00.290]  Just tell him, tell him Geoff said thank you.
[52:00.350 --> 52:01.670]  And Gavin did not.
[52:01.830 --> 52:02.930]  Geoff said thank you.
[52:02.990 --> 52:05.530]  And Gavin said he's not sure about people with the name Chris.
[52:05.590 --> 52:07.830]  He's had bad experiences, but maybe you're OK.
[52:08.710 --> 52:09.150]  That's fair.
[52:09.350 --> 52:09.890]  That's fair.
[52:09.970 --> 52:12.170]  OK, by the way, I'm just calling about the hat.
[52:12.470 --> 52:13.510]  Oh, yeah, they're not for.
[52:13.630 --> 52:16.150]  Listen, I can talk to you about the hats.
[52:16.490 --> 52:17.770]  Let's talk about the hats.
[52:17.890 --> 52:19.170]  I got a store coming, maybe.
[52:19.610 --> 52:20.050]  Maybe not.
[52:20.270 --> 52:20.990]  I don't know.
[52:21.030 --> 52:22.130]  I'm concerned about legal.
[52:22.990 --> 52:23.870]  It'll be a whole thing.
[52:24.070 --> 52:25.770]  I'm going to call you back after this.
[52:27.550 --> 52:29.270]  OK, I'm in a podcast right now.
[52:29.310 --> 52:30.030]  You did amazing.
[52:30.470 --> 52:30.930]  I love you.
[52:31.150 --> 52:32.250]  I'm going to call you back.
[52:34.370 --> 52:35.110]  OK, see you.
[52:35.630 --> 52:35.990]  Incredible.
[52:36.630 --> 52:38.030]  Yeah, it's a good outro, I think.
[52:38.250 --> 52:41.130]  I can't wait to talk to you guys next week.
[52:41.690 --> 52:42.070]  All right.
[52:42.750 --> 52:43.490]  Oh, bye.
