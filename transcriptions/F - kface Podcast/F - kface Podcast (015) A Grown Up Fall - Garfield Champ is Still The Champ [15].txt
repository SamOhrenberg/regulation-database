[00:00.000 --> 00:04.980]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico. Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[00:05.440 --> 00:10.460]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[00:10.560 --> 00:15.380]  but they found something unexpected instead. It was still crisp, lively, and smooth,
[00:15.640 --> 00:18.540]  but it had nothing to do with waves. It was Pacifico,
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.600]  a delicious Mexican lager. It's like it was brewed to be discovered.

[00:40.840 --> 00:44.900]  I've been thinking a lot about the Janus headbutt thing. Yeah, just like how weird
[00:44.900 --> 00:50.360]  sports culture is. Like, the idea that you could headbutt somebody at the place you work,
[00:50.580 --> 00:54.600]  and then be told, like, nah, he's gonna be out Thursday. He'll be back for, like,
[00:54.660 --> 00:58.560]  a one-day suspension for a headbutt. For people to be like, yeah, we all agree you headbutted this
[00:58.560 --> 01:04.120]  guy. Your penalty is you can't show up to work on Thursday. He'll be back Friday, but you gotta
[01:04.120 --> 01:08.200]  take a day. What do you think the punishment should be for a headbutt? It should be a lot
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.380]  of money, and you probably should miss a couple games. I think a few games is fair.
[01:12.820 --> 01:16.080]  Do you remember when Zidane headbutted that guy in the World Cup final?
[01:16.440 --> 01:19.220]  Yes, I do. What trouble did he get into? He got red-carded, right?
[01:19.640 --> 01:22.860]  Yeah, he got sent off. I'm not sure if you get fined in the World Cup, actually.
[01:23.300 --> 01:28.060]  I don't know. Maybe, well... In Premier League, you get a fine that barely registers
[01:28.060 --> 01:33.640]  in your bank account, and, like, two weeks off. Yeah, it's similar in the NBA. You'll get, like,
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.420]  a $25,000 fine, which is a lot of money unless you make $35 million a year, you know?
[01:39.860 --> 01:44.400]  I think more sports should use cards. Like, the red card should be universal.
[01:44.920 --> 01:45.780]  Yeah. It's fun.
[01:46.100 --> 01:50.020]  Across all sports. I'd like to see one happen in, like, tennis or something.
[01:50.540 --> 01:57.600]  Well, I mean, the NBA has it with Texan flagrants. They just don't have the flourish of slinging out
[01:57.600 --> 02:01.980]  a yellow or red color while they do it, you know? I think they should, instead of cards,
[02:01.980 --> 02:07.800]  they should be those gender reveal powder bomb things that just get hurled at the player's head.
[02:09.020 --> 02:14.900]  I've been watching this video of a man who looks and sounds a lot like Ed Asner masturbating
[02:14.900 --> 02:18.700]  and then getting fucked in the ass by another man who also looks like Ed Asner.
[02:19.120 --> 02:21.460]  Is this, like, a hobby? What is this?
[02:21.680 --> 02:28.480]  No! No, it's just a video online, and it was on, like, your mom's house, and
[02:29.020 --> 02:31.860]  I just can't stop watching it. I don't know why.
[02:32.260 --> 02:33.020]  You're watching gay porn?
[02:33.520 --> 02:40.380]  Kind of, yeah. It's just like a dude looking at the camera going, uh, don't be stingy now, Mark.
[02:40.740 --> 02:43.260]  Can you tell me, can you explain to me how it's only kind of?
[02:43.540 --> 02:47.580]  Well, I'm not watching it for the sexual gratification. I'm watching it because it's fucking funny.
[02:47.820 --> 02:49.380]  Gavin, does that make it less gay porn?
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.460]  No, I feel like if there was some really funny gay porn and I watched it for the lols, it's gay porn.
[02:54.460 --> 02:58.700]  I also think it's sweeter than porn. I think that there's some love there.
[02:59.020 --> 03:00.000]  There can be love in porn.
[03:00.260 --> 03:01.880]  Yeah, I just, that's true. That's true.
[03:02.220 --> 03:04.400]  Uh, now that Mike's here, should we do an episode?
[03:04.720 --> 03:05.940]  Yeah, you should start the episode now.
[03:06.140 --> 03:07.200]  Don't be stingy now, Gavin.
[03:07.440 --> 03:08.280]  Do we have to do the intro?
[03:08.700 --> 03:12.080]  What episode is, does anybody know what episode this is? I could not remember.
[03:12.100 --> 03:12.580]  This is 15.
[03:12.940 --> 03:13.540]  How do you know that?
[03:13.560 --> 03:14.240]  Do you keep in count?
[03:14.380 --> 03:19.380]  No, wait, wait, no, no, I don't think it is 15. Wait, because the, the Sonny Jurgensen photo.
[03:19.940 --> 03:23.400]  Yeah, that was wrong. That was wrong. I listened to that episode today.
[03:23.400 --> 03:24.960]  That episode was 13.
[03:25.160 --> 03:25.520]  Okay.
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.720]  Yeah, that the Instagram called 14. Uh, which makes that even funnier, I think.
[03:29.860 --> 03:33.480]  Uh, what's funny is it also in that episode, I announced it as episode 11.
[03:34.640 --> 03:35.560]  Yeah, I think you did.
[03:37.900 --> 03:38.620]  Oh, f***face.
[03:38.700 --> 03:39.220]  3, 2, 1, go.
[03:39.320 --> 03:40.420]  That's this show. Yeah, there you go.
[03:40.640 --> 03:43.480]  Wait, wait, 3, 3, 2...
[03:44.400 --> 03:45.020]  Where's the 1?
[03:45.300 --> 03:48.620]  No, I was doing it like they do it, they do in like broadcasts where you don't say the 1.
[03:48.940 --> 03:49.260]  Because it might...
[03:49.260 --> 03:50.940]  No, but don't they, don't they do the hand gesture?
[03:51.300 --> 03:52.340]  I did the hand gesture.
[03:52.340 --> 03:54.180]  Well, how is that helpful to us?
[03:54.320 --> 03:55.680]  Well, just imagine me doing it.
[03:55.980 --> 03:57.260]  Okay, okay, let's do it again.
[03:57.480 --> 03:58.220]  All right, all right.
[03:59.580 --> 04:00.420]  Quiet on set!
[04:00.700 --> 04:02.660]  All right, uh, 3, 2...
[04:03.660 --> 04:05.940]  That was a good hand gesture. That was really good.
[04:06.120 --> 04:08.960]  You acknowledged the hand gesture, just making it pointless. I might as well have said 1.
[04:09.220 --> 04:11.580]  No, it was so good, I wanted to acknowledge it.
[04:11.840 --> 04:13.400]  I want to give you credit where credit is due.
[04:13.460 --> 04:15.300]  I'm a big believer in giving credit where credit is due.
[04:15.580 --> 04:19.040]  I mean, Geoff didn't come in with the intro. I feel like he maybe didn't imagine the gesture.
[04:19.400 --> 04:22.140]  I thought Andrew was doing the intro this episode.
[04:22.140 --> 04:23.480]  Why would I do the intro?
[04:23.900 --> 04:24.980]  You were talking a lot.
[04:25.140 --> 04:26.300]  Do you want a recount?
[04:26.400 --> 04:27.980]  It's a fucking podcast, what do you mean?
[04:28.060 --> 04:34.320]  You seemed invested in the, with the energy of the beginning, and so I just assumed you were taking the lead.
[04:34.620 --> 04:35.740]  No, never.
[04:36.260 --> 04:37.420]  Well, we can do it again if you want.
[04:37.700 --> 04:38.140]  I'll count you in.
[04:41.920 --> 04:42.800]  3, 2...
[04:42.800 --> 04:45.340]  Hello, and welcome to episode 15 of...
[04:48.580 --> 04:51.520]  Why, why didn't I see that coming?
[04:52.460 --> 04:55.280]  That's the most obvious stupid thing in the world.
[04:56.440 --> 04:58.840]  Oh man, I'm gonna crawl up my own ass.
[04:59.760 --> 05:01.460]  We're like three minutes in at this point.
[05:01.520 --> 05:04.580]  I'm fucking dumb. This pandemic has made me stupid.
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.120]  I still don't think we need the intro.
[05:06.460 --> 05:07.560]  What do you mean, Andrew?
[05:08.060 --> 05:11.440]  I don't think we need an intro to the podcast. I don't think it's necessary.
[05:11.760 --> 05:14.780]  The intro is routinely half the episode.
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.480]  Thanks to you, we also, we don't have one again. Once again, we don't have one.
[05:18.880 --> 05:20.380]  No, we just did one. What do you mean?
[05:20.380 --> 05:24.600]  Every time an intro starts, I mean, obviously I tried to sabotage it,
[05:24.660 --> 05:27.400]  but with you sabotaging it too, it definitely doesn't get pushed through.
[05:27.640 --> 05:29.580]  And now we're four minutes in without an intro.
[05:29.800 --> 05:32.980]  We definitely said the name of the show. I just don't...
[05:32.980 --> 05:35.440]  No, why do we need an intro? Who needs an intro?
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.240]  What's the point? I still don't know what the point of the intro is.
[05:38.520 --> 05:40.860]  Why do you say hello to somebody when you pick up the phone?
[05:41.100 --> 05:42.900]  It's for people who get told...
[05:42.900 --> 05:44.520]  To acknowledge the start of the thing.
[05:44.740 --> 05:47.540]  They get told about the show. They're not going to start with episode one.
[05:47.540 --> 05:50.720]  Episode one is usually always ropey, no matter what the podcast.
[05:51.100 --> 05:51.960]  Ours definitely was.
[05:52.340 --> 05:55.620]  And then you want to hear who's on it. As if it's the first one.
[05:55.720 --> 05:58.880]  Then you might go back if you like it. You might continue to go forwards.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.640]  But every episode, Andrew, needs an intro.
[06:02.100 --> 06:05.240]  I don't feel... I mean, I feel like we say our names through the thing.
[06:05.360 --> 06:07.900]  And every pod... Even with podcasts with intros,
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.280]  it takes like eight episodes to figure out who's who.
[06:10.720 --> 06:13.320]  It always takes a while. The intro doesn't help in that way.
[06:13.540 --> 06:16.120]  We all sound quite different. We're from three different nations.
[06:16.120 --> 06:19.280]  No, that's true. I'm not gonna... Yeah, that's fair.
[06:19.420 --> 06:22.560]  I just... I don't... I don't know. I don't feel like a traditional intro is necessary.
[06:22.880 --> 06:26.440]  I feel like it's kind of like everyone does it because that's what people do.
[06:26.900 --> 06:30.240]  But I don't think it's needed. It's like how people punt in football.
[06:30.360 --> 06:33.860]  What if... What if... How about... How about this?
[06:34.380 --> 06:36.520]  Well, people... Okay, let me clarify. Because Gavin's very...
[06:36.520 --> 06:38.340]  How about... No, you... Please clarify.
[06:38.460 --> 06:41.400]  Statistically, it's better to always go on fourth.
[06:41.540 --> 06:43.740]  But nobody does it because everybody punts.
[06:43.740 --> 06:46.720]  How is that statistically better to go on fourth?
[06:47.080 --> 06:49.140]  If you do the math, listen, there's a high school coach who never punted...
[06:49.140 --> 06:51.020]  If the ball's on your 30 yard line...
[06:51.880 --> 06:58.040]  Listen, I didn't create math. I didn't invent it. I'm just reporting the facts as they are.
[06:58.160 --> 07:00.180]  How is this relevant to the intro? My point is, Eric,
[07:00.420 --> 07:03.740]  every show has an intro because every other show has an intro.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.060]  There's no actual need for the intro.
[07:06.360 --> 07:08.420]  Are you saying you want me to start the countdown from four?
[07:10.400 --> 07:11.640]  I'm not opposed to it.
[07:13.340 --> 07:19.780]  How about this? How about next week, Andrew, episode 16, we try it your way?
[07:20.060 --> 07:24.020]  I feel like we did it last week my way, and it wasn't my way at the time. It just happened.
[07:24.500 --> 07:25.780]  And it went very well.
[07:26.040 --> 07:29.380]  That episode hasn't aired yet, so let's wait and see audience feedback.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.840]  His way is how we've done the last three, and they've been terrible.
[07:34.140 --> 07:34.580]  What do you mean?
[07:34.840 --> 07:37.120]  Well, the last one didn't have an intro. This one didn't.
[07:37.560 --> 07:40.460]  40% of the episode is arguing about the intro.
[07:41.240 --> 07:44.580]  This one definitely had an intro. I would disagree with that one.
[07:44.760 --> 07:49.560]  I refuse to put this conversation's runtime into the total runtime of the episode.
[07:49.700 --> 07:52.620]  The people are getting ripped off with our constant meetings
[07:52.620 --> 07:58.220]  about the intros and outros in the episode, and now we're at like eight minutes without an intro.
[07:58.320 --> 08:02.100]  What if we did a full episode just about the intro? That'd be pretty good.
[08:02.240 --> 08:05.520]  We can't. We can't. We had half an episode about a hat, Andrew. We can't.
[08:06.940 --> 08:08.340]  I thought that was pretty good.
[08:09.360 --> 08:12.400]  Let's, uh, let's, that's something to work toward. Maybe in our,
[08:12.520 --> 08:14.740]  maybe for our one-year anniversary, it could be the intro episode.
[08:14.940 --> 08:17.160]  I disagree, though. This one definitely had an intro.
[08:17.860 --> 08:20.520]  Okay. Wait, you disagree that it had an intro?
[08:20.740 --> 08:24.400]  No, I disagree that it did not have an intro. This definitely had an intro.
[08:24.660 --> 08:27.840]  Okay. Maybe it was in there. Maybe I just didn't, maybe I missed it.
[08:28.060 --> 08:29.540]  The show name was definitely said.
[08:29.840 --> 08:31.560]  Gavin definitely stepped on it, that's for sure.
[08:33.060 --> 08:42.080]  Oh, man. A little bit of housekeeping since we're started.
[08:42.220 --> 08:45.420]  Wanted to let everybody know if you don't, if you aren't aware of it yet,
[08:45.540 --> 08:51.400]  uh, there is an official now, uh, we've determined the need. We talked about it
[08:51.400 --> 08:58.000]  previously. There's an official f***face podcast Instagram that you can go and, uh,
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.420]  subscribe to if you would. It's just, uh, I guess if I say the name, it's going to get bleeped and
[09:03.420 --> 09:07.820]  you won't know if the bleep is a part of the name. It's, can I, can I, can I spell our name? Does
[09:07.820 --> 09:15.800]  that work? Yeah, you can spell it. It's F-U-C-K-F-A-C-E-P-O-D. That's our Instagram. And
[09:15.800 --> 09:24.000]  it's, uh, rich with, uh, pictures I assume of, of burgers and, uh, drawings of, of, uh, round-faced
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.800]  men looking up at the heavens. Speaking of drawings. And the God that smote them. Yeah. I, I've gotten
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.440]  a lot. People have sent me a lot of drawings based on the discussion of the episode. I'm
[09:35.440 --> 09:41.800]  going to share a few here. I feel like this, this is a very, uh, definitive case. Here's, here's one.
[09:41.920 --> 09:48.000]  Oh yeah. They totally got it. Yeah, they got it. They nailed it. Oh, look, another person
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.380]  who absolutely understood what I was talking about. Here's the third one. You've got,
[09:53.380 --> 09:58.320]  your nose where the hair should be. You got your mouth in the middle and you got your standard ears.
[09:58.680 --> 10:05.120]  Exactly. Prove to me that these aren't professional artists. I mean, for all I know, for all I know,
[10:05.360 --> 10:09.040]  those, that, that's like, that's could be Damien Hirst on the other end of one of those notepads.
[10:09.620 --> 10:15.720]  Obviously, the, the prof- like, world-renowned, oh look, another, I can't even imagine who that is.
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.580]  Is that like, Neckface? Some famous street artist maybe? Is that Banksy? Probably. I'll be honest,
[10:21.580 --> 10:29.160]  I showed the discussion to Meg, my very wonderful girlfriend. And I basically told her that,
[10:29.340 --> 10:33.360]  I played her the bit where Andrew was describing the points that need to be included in the photo.
[10:33.780 --> 10:37.420]  And I asked her, you know, if she can picture what that is. And she's like, absolutely. I've
[10:37.420 --> 10:42.080]  got that in my head. I, and then I showed her Geoff's ones and she honestly thought something
[10:42.080 --> 10:48.880]  was wrong with you, Geoff. Look, well, look, you can judge for yourself because they're up. It's
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.940]  second post on, on the F*** Face pod on Instagram. And you, they're even, you can even rank them
[10:54.940 --> 11:00.000]  there. It's got my three photos and Gavin's one. There's no need to rank them. I, I just googled it
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.160]  and, uh, I got to take it. Oh, that's not ours. We couldn't get just F*** Face? Nah, we can't.
[11:07.240 --> 11:11.520]  Well, we got F*** Face pod. That's good enough. Okay. Yeah. Uh, and, uh, by the time this comes
[11:11.520 --> 11:17.280]  out, I'll, there'll be a bunch of f***ing pictures of, uh, just monstrous McDonald hamburger patties
[11:17.280 --> 11:22.880]  sandwiched in between sad, struggling buns. And God knows what else. We've got a basket
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.520]  weaving on there. We've got grills. We've got, wait, this isn't the right one either. This is,
[11:27.580 --> 11:32.900]  this is another one. F*** Face pod. It's only got two posts. Sorry, I was looking at the one
[11:32.900 --> 11:38.120]  that actually came up first in the search was F*** Face podcast, which isn't us, but it is all the
[11:38.120 --> 11:44.320]  stuff. Pod. Wow. That's the second result. Yeah. We're not even first.
[11:46.380 --> 11:51.220]  We're new to the game. We've got to work out those subscribers so that we rock it to the top
[11:51.920 --> 12:00.060]  of our own search. Oh, also, uh, I'm excited about it though, because it's going to allow us to put,
[12:00.180 --> 12:04.680]  we, we talk about so much stuff visually that then we share on discord that, you know, then
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.860]  maybe eventually at some point finds its way into a Twitter or somewhere, you know, or Reddit.
[12:09.380 --> 12:12.280]  So it's cool that we have a place to kind of coalesce and put it all there.
[12:12.780 --> 12:17.540]  I don't know who's running it or anything, but they seem, uh, pretty hilarious though.
[12:17.880 --> 12:22.820]  Great job so far. Kudos to them, whoever that is. How many shows use this discord
[12:22.820 --> 12:29.520]  for their podcasts? Oh, I don't know. That's an Eric question. Two? Okay. Just two. I was
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.220]  kind of hoping it was more just the concept that people would see these images without any context
[12:34.220 --> 12:40.180]  is wonderful. Just like the nightmare of burgers and up, up faces and a lot of good stuff here.
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.960]  It's true. It's a repository of many wonderful things, uh, that taken out of context are very
[12:44.960 --> 12:50.060]  bizarre. Oh, uh, one other piece of, uh, housekeeping while, uh, while we're starting
[12:50.060 --> 12:54.420]  off. Uh, I mentioned that we have that Instagram thing. And then the other thing is we we've kind
[12:54.420 --> 12:59.400]  of gotten away from it, but, uh, at, at some point in this podcast, it's also about creating
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.300]  the ultimate face collection. And currently it, it exists. Uh, we have two items in it.
[13:05.360 --> 13:13.100]  We have the Billy Ripken face card and we have cool Coolio's daredevil actor card autographed,
[13:13.100 --> 13:16.780]  which is funny because he was cut from the movie, but they still put his autograph in.
[13:16.900 --> 13:23.620]  Uh, and until this moment, uh, Andrew Panton has been the only person on earth to have a complete
[13:23.620 --> 13:28.020]  face collection. But I'd like to draw your attention to the discord.
[13:28.540 --> 13:34.480]  You got both photo, which will also be on the discord, uh, or on the, uh, aforementioned
[13:34.480 --> 13:40.320]  Instagram account. I, uh, am now the proud owner of a Coolio daredevil 2003 movie card.
[13:40.460 --> 13:45.360]  No way. Yeah. I bought a box immediately when Andrew talked about it. We were talking about
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.780]  today that I think there were like 10 or 12 boxes, uh, like on eBay. I bought one that day.
[13:49.800 --> 13:55.540]  It ended up being in Australia. It never showed up. Then like a month ago, I just got a canceled
[13:55.540 --> 14:00.160]  order. So I went to buy another one and there were no more boxes available anywhere. We couldn't
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.620]  buy them anywhere. So Andrew and I think we may have unintentionally inflated the demand for the
[14:05.620 --> 14:09.780]  Coolio cards, but I finally caught a box and then I was reading about it. And I don't, you don't
[14:09.780 --> 14:14.580]  have a very good chance of getting an autograph at all. It's a good pull. And, uh, it was like
[14:14.580 --> 14:18.600]  the sixth pack of cards I opened Coolio autograph, which tells me... You must have been stoked.
[14:18.900 --> 14:24.940]  I was so fucking excited. I was so happy. I rubbed it in Andrew's face immediately. And, uh, it just
[14:24.940 --> 14:30.560]  put me further into the idea. I know you do, buddy. And now we both do. That we're on the right path
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.540]  here with this f*** face collection thing. So there are now two people on earth that I'm aware of,
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.640]  at least with the name Andrew or Geoff, that own both of those cards. You need to get in on this
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.260]  Coolio action, Gavin. Yeah. There's one box left. There's only one. You have mine. What do you mean
[14:45.260 --> 14:50.300]  I have yours? That was what I was meant to get. I don't understand what you're saying. Because
[14:50.300 --> 14:56.460]  I won hamburger bet number one. And when you're going to put your Coolio one in a safe. Oh yeah,
[14:56.520 --> 15:02.020]  but you never responded. So that deals off the table. Well, come on now. You missed it. You had
[15:02.020 --> 15:10.340]  a chance. Go buy a box. Go buy the last box in existence. Go buy a pallet. So there's still only
[15:10.340 --> 15:16.960]  two items in the official f*** face collection. So far that I'm aware of. Andrew and I talked about,
[15:16.960 --> 15:21.720]  we've been talking about it a lot offline, and I don't know if we want to force it, but there's a
[15:21.720 --> 15:26.820]  bunch of funny stuff we could do. Like there's this dude that Andrew found, a hockey player.
[15:27.160 --> 15:31.180]  You could tell the story better, Andrew, if we haven't already. The dude that got traded for a
[15:31.180 --> 15:36.260]  bus. Yeah, there's this guy that got traded to another team in exchange for a bus because the
[15:36.260 --> 15:41.100]  team he was currently playing for needed it to travel to other arenas. And for the rest of his
[15:41.100 --> 15:47.660]  career, his nickname was Bussy for like every team he played. And that's just wonderful. So I
[15:47.660 --> 15:55.620]  think he is definitely in consideration. So Andrew sent me on eBay Canada or Amazon Canada, I had to
[15:55.620 --> 16:00.640]  change my country to view it, some pack of hockey cards that may or may not have a bussy in it. So
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.240]  I bought it. I have no idea if and when the package will show up from Canada, but I'm very
[16:05.240 --> 16:11.600]  excited to get a bussy. It's a great card. You couldn't write that. Like what an unfortunate
[16:11.600 --> 16:19.720]  thing to be known for. So sad. Also like zero control by him. Like that's just a fate that was
[16:19.720 --> 16:25.140]  dealt. Like he can't pick if he gets traded or not or for what. I had a thing happen to me the other
[16:25.140 --> 16:29.680]  night that I feel like no one would ever write because it would have to have happened just so
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.700]  you could have that idea. But I filled my water bottle. It's like a, it's not a thermos, but it's
[16:34.700 --> 16:40.000]  a metal one to keep it cold. And I dropped it in my bedroom and it was full. So it made like an
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.280]  awful clang on the floor. It was like, and then a bunch of black shit went everywhere, like spread
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.820]  across the floor. And I was like, what? And I was like, what happened? Cause the drink thing is blue.
[16:51.860 --> 16:57.800]  And I was like, there wasn't anything black on this. And I realized that the drink flask had
[16:57.800 --> 17:04.140]  landed on my pair of shorts, but on the, on the button for the fly, which was a black plastic
[17:04.140 --> 17:09.420]  button. And it just shattered it all across my bedroom floor. And I was, I've never been so
[17:09.420 --> 17:13.960]  confused. And I was like, no one would ever come up with that. That would have have to happen.
[17:14.420 --> 17:18.420]  You would never just come up with, oh yeah, he dropped his drink on his, uh, his trousers,
[17:18.680 --> 17:24.180]  but it exploded. It's like the worst trick shot of all time. Yeah. And I've got to throw
[17:24.180 --> 17:28.300]  the shorts away. I guess I could use a spare button. I was going to ask if you're, if you're
[17:28.300 --> 17:31.560]  going to replace the button or if you're going to chuck the shorts. I probably won't chuck the
[17:31.560 --> 17:37.400]  shorts. I'll probably keep them for, you know, slow filming. If I get messy. It's been my
[17:37.400 --> 17:42.300]  experience that you hold onto clothes longer than just about anybody I've ever met. Here's my thing
[17:42.300 --> 17:47.580]  with that. If they still function, like if a pair of shorts still does what it's supposed to do.
[17:47.600 --> 17:54.460]  And that, in my opinion is to cover my anus and penis, right? Yeah. They work. If they're ripped
[17:54.460 --> 17:58.800]  or if they're covered in paint or they got some faded old oil stain on them, they still are
[17:58.800 --> 18:02.840]  perfectly functional and I will not throw them away. I just maybe won't wear them to a fancy
[18:02.840 --> 18:07.960]  restaurant. I think it's to be applauded. I mean, what was the first year you came and stayed with
[18:07.960 --> 18:14.380]  me? Do you remember what year, like 2000? 2006. Was it really that long ago? Yeah. Okay. Well,
[18:14.440 --> 18:22.540]  maybe not then, but like I guarantee you in 2008 in my house, you wore wearing shorts or a t-shirt
[18:22.540 --> 18:27.220]  that I've seen you wear in the last six months. Oh, absolutely. It's cool, man. You probably own
[18:27.220 --> 18:35.580]  more... I don't see how that makes any sense, but okay. Yeah, it was a good bleep. Yep. Yep.
[18:35.800 --> 18:39.280]  Oh, we have a we have a system for that. You should have like gave me notification. I could
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.220]  have the show name. Oh, remember? Oh, I should have should have coordinated that. That's a good
[18:45.220 --> 18:51.320]  yeah. You're a live censorship. I am. I'm always late or early. I've never hit it once. I was
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.620]  terrible at it. Have you had anything happen to you that no one would come up with in a script?
[18:55.620 --> 19:01.740]  Oh, literally this morning. Yeah. I feel like that's your life to be honest. It's going to be
[19:01.740 --> 19:07.080]  hard to even articulate. And it's not like a well, it's just a weird thing. The first thing I did this
[19:07.080 --> 19:13.540]  morning was I woke up. I went to use the bathroom and then I immediately face planted. I did right
[19:13.540 --> 19:21.720]  on my face. Just face first to the ground. Why? It was great. My foot got caught on a towel and
[19:21.720 --> 19:27.600]  it started to slide. My foot was sliding left and I was starting to go into like a splits position
[19:27.600 --> 19:33.040]  and I am not James Brown. I'm not ready for that. So I tried to like push. I tried to lean forward
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.780]  to try to counter the splits and I fell and I just landed face first on my bathroom floor.
[19:38.140 --> 19:44.560]  That was the start of my day. I like that you tried to counter side to side movement by leaning
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.920]  forwards. Yeah. Well, like I wasn't prepared. This is a panic move Gavin. I tried to reach for
[19:49.920 --> 19:55.880]  my bathtub to regain balance and I just went face first to the floor. And that was in the bathroom?
[19:56.180 --> 20:00.540]  Bathroom. Yeah. I feel like I've seen people slip in bathrooms in movies and on TV. I feel like
[20:00.540 --> 20:05.980]  I feel like you could come up with that. No, but face first, like nothing else hitting first.
[20:06.120 --> 20:12.980]  It's impressive to fall face first in your bathroom, tripping on a towel. How did you not chip a tooth?
[20:12.980 --> 20:20.200]  I tried. I like landed kind of nose forehead. It was a comedic, it was a comedic face first fall.
[20:20.220 --> 20:23.960]  You're totally fucking fine, but I try to eat some saltwater taffy and half my face falls out.
[20:24.020 --> 20:31.260]  That's really unfair. Did you ever see, did you ever see the movie Skyfall where the Bond villain
[20:31.780 --> 20:36.080]  takes out his false jaw and all this face like caves in? That's what I'm imagining happened to
[20:36.080 --> 20:45.720]  Geoff up there. So, uh, I guess that that woke you up. Yeah, that was a great start to the day.
[20:46.400 --> 20:51.380]  It was awesome. It was one of those things were like the odd sort of like your button,
[20:51.800 --> 20:57.440]  the like when you start a fall standing upright and it's very slow. It's not a fast fall. This
[20:57.440 --> 21:03.620]  was a slow fall. The land face first. Statistically, not very likely. There's something very
[21:03.620 --> 21:09.100]  disappointing about falling as an adult. Like as a kid, it's like flash fell again. But now it's
[21:09.100 --> 21:14.240]  like, as you start a fall, it's like, seriously, am I going to be falling right now? Am I going
[21:14.240 --> 21:20.400]  to fall down in my thirties? Sure am. And it's actually disappointing. And falling as an adult
[21:20.400 --> 21:25.540]  is, it feels very different than falling as a kid. It's hard to shake off a grownup fall.
[21:26.100 --> 21:34.380]  It's true. I used to love to fall. I miss falling. I fucking, dude, I tried to, I changed the position
[21:34.380 --> 21:43.020]  of the seat in my car and I may have to have surgery now. Like I have to get a fucking MRI
[21:43.020 --> 21:49.440]  tomorrow morning because I tried to, I thought I slouched too much and I thought I'd change my
[21:49.440 --> 21:55.360]  posture. So for two months I sat up straight and now my shoulder's eating itself and I may
[21:55.360 --> 22:01.220]  have to get it fucking surgically repaired. I've been in physical therapy for almost four months
[22:01.220 --> 22:08.000]  and the fucking progress report is, yeah, it's not working. We might have to repair it.
[22:08.400 --> 22:14.260]  All I did was sit up. That can't be what did it. Well, I don't know what else it would have been.
[22:14.400 --> 22:19.160]  The only other thing I can even think of that could have possibly contributed to it
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.720]  is when I had to climb 120 feet in the air with that rope and I couldn't move my arm for two weeks
[22:23.720 --> 22:31.620]  after. Which coincides with around the time that the problem started. But probably coincidence.
[22:32.140 --> 22:35.380]  No, I think you're definitely right. It's just from sitting upright. I think you're sitting
[22:35.380 --> 22:40.300]  upright too much. It didn't start hurting and then cause all this until I sat up. That was
[22:40.300 --> 22:45.400]  the fucking catalyst. Geoff, have you ever had any things happen that no one would write?
[22:46.020 --> 22:49.640]  Do you think your saltwater taffy incident would count for that? No, I don't think that would count.
[22:49.640 --> 22:58.440]  I feel like my life for a very long time was a series of small moments like that.
[22:59.340 --> 23:03.160]  And I was actually sitting here listening to you talk about your button story and Andrew
[23:03.160 --> 23:09.480]  doing the James Brown faceplant splits and thinking about how kind of happy I am that
[23:09.480 --> 23:15.760]  I feel like the universe has let me pass that torch on to other people. And that shit
[23:16.360 --> 23:20.360]  like that shit doesn't happen to me like it used to. I can think of a million instances. I can
[23:20.360 --> 23:26.300]  think of one. One of my favorite is you were there for was I do that thing where I can take a bottle
[23:26.300 --> 23:30.600]  cap and I can snap my fingers with the bottle cap at the edge of my fingers and I can like
[23:30.600 --> 23:34.500]  zing it across the room and I can make it go pretty far and I can make it hit. I can make it hurt you
[23:34.500 --> 23:38.480]  if I hit you hard like in the face. That's true. And one time we were in my kitchen. This probably
[23:38.480 --> 23:48.160]  2010 or 11 Geoff and I flicked one at you and it zinged off to the side and it hit the countertop
[23:48.160 --> 23:54.960]  in such a way that it bounced back and hit me in the forehead and embedded into my forehead
[23:54.960 --> 24:02.200]  and cut me open and was hanging out of my fleshy head while it was bleeding in the span of three
[24:02.200 --> 24:06.680]  seconds. It bounced off the counter and then bounced up off the wall behind the counter and
[24:06.680 --> 24:13.080]  just straight back into his head and stuck there and I almost shat exploded with laughter. I could
[24:13.080 --> 24:19.460]  not believe it. It was like in the most instant karma I've ever seen in my life. It only hung there
[24:19.460 --> 24:24.760]  for like a few seconds, but yeah, it fell off. Just like you with both of your hands out in like
[24:25.660 --> 24:29.720]  and it's just like you're like your eyes are crossed inwards trying to look at it.
[24:30.180 --> 24:36.380]  It was an amazing sight in time in the history of the universe. That was a phenomenal one moment.
[24:36.920 --> 24:42.140]  I feel like I've got like 40 something years of those just memories built on top of each other,
[24:42.260 --> 24:47.640]  but now I feel like maybe the universe is gonna go easy on me in my old age. It's like
[24:47.640 --> 24:54.900]  Jesus Christ, the guy's falling apart. He can't ratchet the seat up two positions
[24:54.900 --> 25:00.360]  without his shoulder falling off. We can't be letting him trip out of bed in the morning.
[25:01.720 --> 25:07.900]  Oh, Christ almighty. How's your tooth? It's fine. You know, I go back in like two weeks to get it
[25:07.900 --> 25:12.980]  finished. It's pretty not eventful. I don't chew on that side of my face anymore just to be safe.
[25:13.580 --> 25:17.960]  So the right side of my face is constantly tired and droopy. And I assume that this is
[25:17.960 --> 25:23.480]  it's probably what it would feel like if I had like a minor stroke. You know, I just feel like
[25:23.480 --> 25:28.000]  just like saggy and exhausted from all the over chewing on the right side. Who knows what kind
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.580]  of damage we're doing there. But that's fine. We'll get it all taken care of in like two weeks
[25:32.580 --> 25:39.000]  and then I'll whine about it for a while and mope about, you know, the jackhammering and whatnot
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.420]  to you guys. And then we'll just move on until the next time I dare to use my mouth for its intended
[25:46.420 --> 25:51.180]  purpose. What's unfortunate about the scenario you're describing is you're saying that those
[25:51.180 --> 25:55.860]  events no longer happen to you. And it sounds like they're still happening. It's just not funny
[25:55.860 --> 26:01.920]  anymore. Like you're still getting hurt. Your body is rejecting itself. You're losing toenails.
[26:02.580 --> 26:06.980]  It's just not a great story. Can I give you guys a toenail update? Oh, do you have to?
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.900]  I told you guys I wasn't going to look at my toenail for a year, right? And just look at it
[26:12.900 --> 26:17.640]  in a year. That was what I proclaimed in whatever episode of this podcast. I was like, I'm just not
[26:17.640 --> 26:20.400]  going to think about it. I'm not going to look at it. I don't have to look at my foot. It doesn't
[26:20.400 --> 26:25.080]  have to look at me. We can exist. The other day, curiosity got the better of me in the shower,
[26:25.080 --> 26:33.380]  and I looked totally, completely normal toenail back where like it was never gone.
[26:33.620 --> 26:37.880]  My toenail grew back quickly. I had to cut it. It was too long.
[26:39.440 --> 26:44.740]  You said that like Gavin and I both believe that you genuinely didn't plan on looking at your
[26:44.740 --> 26:51.180]  toenail for a year. I told you. I know you said it, but I didn't think that that was a real thing.
[26:51.180 --> 26:56.000]  Oh yeah, I was not planning on looking at it. How many weeks have passed? That's like over a
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.440]  month ago. You haven't looked at your toe in over a month. I didn't look at my toe for probably six
[27:00.440 --> 27:11.000]  weeks until I finally did. At Cox, we're always a step ahead. Like your dog who barks before the
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.880]  doorbell rings. Senses trouble before there's trouble. Like advanced security that blocks
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.080]  online threats before they happen. And knows when the peanut butter's hiding medicine. That's why
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.600]  we keep surprises off your belt. With Pricelock, the price of your internet and mobile plan won't
[27:26.600 --> 27:32.180]  go up for up to three years guaranteed. Rates are burked a lot. Cox, a step ahead. Requires at least

[29:09.040 --> 29:14.500]  Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics, and simple shopping. Here's the deal,
[29:14.680 --> 29:18.680]  Mack Weldon is certain that they're going to be the most comfortable underwear, socks, shirts,
[29:19.160 --> 29:23.860]  undershirts, hoodies, or sweatpants that you will ever wear. They even have a line of silver
[29:23.860 --> 29:28.360]  underwear and shirts that are naturally anti- this is going to be fun to say, I always have a
[29:28.360 --> 29:33.160]  trouble with it, but they're a trouble, I always have multiple troubles with it. They are naturally
[29:33.160 --> 29:39.140]  anti-microbial. Nailed it that time, yes! Must have been the Mack Weldon I'm wearing.
[29:39.580 --> 29:42.600]  They want you to be comfortable, so if you don't like your first pair of underwear,
[29:42.800 --> 29:48.520]  you can keep it and they will still refund you, no questions asked. That's a level of
[29:48.520 --> 29:54.580]  customer service you don't see that often in the 2020s. It's become a harsh world, it's cold,
[29:54.940 --> 29:59.280]  it's refreshing to know that there are people out there like the Mack Weldons who still prize
[29:59.280 --> 30:04.660]  customer service overall. The folks at Mack Weldon have even created their own totally free
[30:04.660 --> 30:11.660]  loyalty program called Weldon Blue. Weldon Blue sounds like the head rower on the Oxford rowing
[30:11.660 --> 30:16.720]  team. Level 1 gets you free shipping for life, and once you reach level 2 by spending $200,
[30:17.460 --> 30:22.600]  Mack Weldon will start giving you 20% off every order for the next year. And let's be honest,
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.960]  don't we all want a little Weldon Blue in our lives? That dude's taller than us, he's got like
[30:27.960 --> 30:33.540]  curly hair but not too curly hair, and it's like, it's that kind of blonde that's like,
[30:33.560 --> 30:37.680]  it's like dusty blonde. Ugh, it's like too attractive. He's got piercing blue eyes,
[30:37.920 --> 30:45.020]  and he's got this chest from all the rowing. Ugh, Weldon Blue, I wish. I was looking over my
[30:45.020 --> 30:52.520]  underwear selection as it were the other day and realized, while it's good to be frugal, at some
[30:52.520 --> 30:59.740]  point, you gotta recognize it's time for a wardrobe refresh. And so I'm gonna be going to
[30:59.740 --> 31:06.580]  the Mack Weldon store, and I'm just gonna go crazy. I'm gonna go Weldon Wild, and I'm gonna harness
[31:06.580 --> 31:13.340]  my inner rower, my inner Weldon Blue, and I'm gonna row my way to a whole new wardrobe of
[31:13.340 --> 31:19.500]  underwear. And I know my gentlemen are gonna thank me. For 20% off your first order, visit
[31:19.500 --> 31:26.600]  mackweldon.com slash face, and enter promo code face. Your downstairs face will thank you.
[31:28.340 --> 31:35.140]  I feel like, because last week, obviously, we addressed the second failure in hamburger eating,
[31:35.890 --> 31:42.240]  but we didn't really touch on the punishment for you losing. What do you mean? Well, when we made
[31:42.240 --> 31:45.880]  the bet, you don't remember what you had to do when you lost? Well, I just, I owe you an additional
[31:45.880 --> 31:52.880]  100. Right, also, you have to eat a pencil. No, that wasn't part of the bet, was it? Yeah.
[31:53.960 --> 31:58.980]  I don't think that was, I don't think, I think those were two separate conversations. What?
[31:59.600 --> 32:03.340]  I don't think those were, no, I'm pretty sure those were separate, because we talked about
[32:03.340 --> 32:08.740]  eating doors, and then, like, talked about pens. I think those were unrelated. They were not
[32:08.740 --> 32:13.920]  unrelated. That was the whole reason to attempt the freaking burgers again, was there was a pencil
[32:13.920 --> 32:17.540]  at stake, and you were like, oh, I'm gonna grate, I'm gonna grate the pencil, and I thought you were
[32:17.540 --> 32:22.180]  grating burgers. I was like, what you on about? And then you were saying, no, it's a pencil. I remember
[32:22.180 --> 32:27.140]  that completely differently. I remember those as two very separate conversations that had nothing
[32:27.140 --> 32:32.100]  to do with it. Eric, were you there for that one? Do you remember? There's no way. An impartial judge?
[32:32.380 --> 32:38.620]  I do remember, and I have to side with Andrew. I remember them being... Oh, son of a bitch. I'm very sorry.
[32:38.800 --> 32:43.620]  I mean, for content, I would love to side with Gavin, but I do remember these conversations. I
[32:43.620 --> 32:49.500]  remember it was eating a pencil, eating a door, it was all of that, and it didn't, to me, come across
[32:49.500 --> 32:56.060]  like that was part of the bet. I'm incredibly sorry, because I want him to eat pencils, but I have to
[32:56.060 --> 33:02.540]  be true to fuckface. I reckon we got some bad memories up in this podcast. I think we probably
[33:02.540 --> 33:09.180]  need to go to the tape. I'm pretty sure the tape is clear. Let's hold on. This is the part
[33:09.180 --> 33:15.560]  where either Nick Willer won't cut in the rollback. All right, maybe he played it there, or if he
[33:15.560 --> 33:19.480]  didn't have it, then it just immediately cuts to me with his explanation. We kind of need to know.
[33:19.860 --> 33:25.040]  I do. We do need to know. Well, maybe the audience will tell us, and when this comes out... Well, fuck,
[33:25.100 --> 33:30.160]  this won't come out for like two weeks. Here, I'll find out right now. I'll tweet, is
[33:33.260 --> 33:40.080]  Andrew supposed to eat pencils? No, because they're gonna say yes, because it's funny. Let me
[33:40.080 --> 33:46.480]  forget this. The last one that came out was the shitty Riddler. The one before that, Judge Judy
[33:46.480 --> 33:52.840]  Footrub, you hadn't done it yet. The one before that, I forgot about Pissboy. I think that was
[33:52.840 --> 33:58.320]  the one. No, I think the Judge Judy Footrub, I think, was the burger bet, I want to say.
[33:58.920 --> 34:04.380]  I will say, I was talking to a friend about this, and they sent me a list of the ranking
[34:04.380 --> 34:10.100]  the most and least edible types of wood. So, some research has been done, but I have no plans
[34:10.100 --> 34:15.240]  on eating a pencil. I feel like I should get a break after all this burger... I mean, burger
[34:15.240 --> 34:22.060]  stuff was hard. So, you're looking to be rewarded for failure? I'm not looking to be rewarded. I'm
[34:22.060 --> 34:25.940]  saying I don't want to immediately eat a pencil for no reason. Well, it sounds like if you're...
[34:26.480 --> 34:32.000]  I was not part of the bet. Well, the audience hasn't weighed in yet. Yeah, we gotta wait for
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.520]  Eric's tweet to go live. Dad, I'm not... the tweet doesn't matter. The tweet is live. It's just a
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.580]  bunch of people liking it, but no one telling me if he's supposed to eat pencils. Eric Badour
[34:44.160 --> 34:50.900]  tweeted simply this. Is Andrew Panton supposed to eat pencils? Dad, that's the most useless
[34:50.900 --> 34:54.660]  tweet you could have written. There's no context. If somebody responds with,
[34:54.920 --> 35:00.020]  if he loses that bet he is, then we'll know. Exactly. See? Look at Geoff. Geoff knows exactly
[35:00.020 --> 35:03.940]  because you were worried... Why wouldn't you just include the context? No, because you were worried
[35:03.940 --> 35:07.940]  that they were just going to say yes because it was part of the bet and all this stuff. What I'm
[35:07.940 --> 35:11.340]  doing, there's a barrier of entry because now people will say... My point is people want to
[35:11.340 --> 35:15.980]  see someone eat a pencil. That's my point. And with no context to the bet, they're going to say yes
[35:15.980 --> 35:18.760]  because we didn't talk about it. I'm flipping on this. Gavin, I'm on your side. I think he's
[35:18.760 --> 35:25.920]  supposed to eat pencils. I'm definitely not. What a betrayal that was. He moved to the other
[35:25.920 --> 35:32.060]  side of the board. I'm friends with your dad now, Eric. How could this be? How could you turn on me
[35:32.060 --> 35:39.200]  like this? Don't bring my dad into this one. I'm seeing, is there any replies yet? No. No,
[35:39.340 --> 35:44.520]  11 likes. It's just people liking it. I don't like it. Tell me if he's supposed to eat pencils.
[35:45.140 --> 35:52.220]  I will say I have an update related to the burger thing. Before we move on to your update,
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.060]  we are putting a pin in this. This is not a decided issue. I'm not eating a pen.
[35:57.460 --> 36:01.500]  Of course not because that was not part of the bet, but you may have agreed to eat a pencil.
[36:01.980 --> 36:06.340]  I never agreed. I said I think I could do it, I think. I think I said there are ways it could
[36:06.340 --> 36:11.360]  be done. I would shave it. I'd do the shavings as we talked about before. This is just going
[36:11.360 --> 36:18.180]  over old territory. I never said I would eat a pencil if I lost a burger bet. We're going to
[36:18.180 --> 36:23.880]  find out. There's no way you didn't. I definitely did. There's a 0% chance. I'm going to tell you
[36:23.880 --> 36:30.200]  right now, Andrew, I think you're a smart young kid with a good memory, but I will say that
[36:30.200 --> 36:36.980]  virtually every time I've gone, and I hate to admit it, but almost every time I've gone up
[36:36.980 --> 36:43.380]  against Gavin in a battle of memory, I have lost to the tune of a lot of embarrassing things. He
[36:43.380 --> 36:48.500]  owns my car. It's true. I won Geoff's car. Because he had a better memory than I did. Which, by the
[36:48.500 --> 36:52.600]  way, I may need to trade my car in on a new car, so I'll talk to you about that offline. Thanks,
[36:52.700 --> 36:59.020]  buddy. Yeah, so I would hate to be against Gavin on this, just historically. I don't think this
[36:59.020 --> 37:04.460]  is a battle of memories, though. I think Gavin's just trying to will this into existence. I thought
[37:04.460 --> 37:07.780]  the same thing about a little guy named Pubert Adams.
[37:12.480 --> 37:15.680]  All right, well, okay, it's up in the air. It's in the audience's hands, I think.
[37:16.080 --> 37:22.500]  Yeah. We have two replies come in so far. One saying no, and one saying I don't know, but why
[37:22.500 --> 37:27.140]  not? I think that's a definitive no. I'm gonna look. No, no, well, that's one. Let's see. Hold
[37:27.140 --> 37:33.700]  on. Of the people that have said no, no one said yes. 100% of the replies so far have been no.
[37:33.700 --> 37:39.020]  I'll be honest, I'm feeling much less confident. I definitely, you've created two covers. They're
[37:39.020 --> 37:44.440]  back to back, so I could get how it could be confused, but I'm almost 100% sure. Keep looking.
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.700]  How about now? Put a pencil on the line. Well, you don't count. That doesn't count. Oh, a new
[37:50.700 --> 37:56.500]  tweet. Oh, a new tweet by someone here. Just some random member of the audience. If he lost that
[37:56.500 --> 38:02.840]  bet, he does. Oh, that does not sound good for you, Andrew. I, you know, that person also seems
[38:02.840 --> 38:08.780]  to have a problem grasping tenses, um, based on the question. Excuse me, there, there's an update.
[38:09.180 --> 38:13.760]  Someone named Dag said, of course, but if I remember correctly, Geoff has influenced the
[38:13.760 --> 38:19.680]  audience at this point. Hold on, hold on. It says, of course, but if I remember correctly,
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.400]  it was without the graphite. Which we did discuss. Yep. Yep. I don't think I agreed to that.
[38:26.100 --> 38:28.820]  Listen, if I did... I just like Geoff's phrasing.
[38:29.860 --> 38:32.920]  If he lost the bet, he does supposed to eat pencils.
[38:37.640 --> 38:42.520]  We'll look into this. If I said it, then I'll, I'll figure out a way to make this happen. I'm
[38:42.520 --> 38:48.560]  a man of my word, but I don't, I'm almost 100% sure I never, uh, crossed this. We, it's no,
[38:48.580 --> 38:52.080]  there's no need to, we don't need to get upset about it now. We'll, we'll go back and roll the
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.620]  tape and, and we'll, uh, we'll let, you know, facts play this out. If you bring the receipts,
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.720]  I'll accept it. Fair enough. Uh, what was your other update related to your failure?
[39:00.940 --> 39:06.420]  Well, because of my failure, I'm in crippling burger debt. As you know, pant line still
[39:07.160 --> 39:13.300]  hasn't happened. I say you're Luca Donchik card info. Yeah, that's true. But that's only,
[39:13.420 --> 39:18.140]  this is going to go up. It's going to skyrocket those Luca rookie cards. Can't sell them now.
[39:18.560 --> 39:25.040]  So I, uh, I introduced my store last week, the great, not the rooster tea store. Cause it's not
[39:25.040 --> 39:29.660]  the rooster tea store. Eric already provided a link. Didn't even need to do it. I have made
[39:29.660 --> 39:35.640]  updates to my store. Oh, that, uh, I'd encourage you both to, to check out and enjoy. We have
[39:35.640 --> 39:41.520]  added, uh, some additional merchandise. We have a testimonial video because we are a very legitimate
[39:41.520 --> 39:46.060]  business. Oh, so people are going to hear about it for the first time, but look up this version.
[39:46.060 --> 39:52.600]  Yeah. They're going to see 2.0 on the first one. And it's a more, it's a more deep site. There's
[39:52.600 --> 40:02.180]  more info. We've expanded. Oh, so what's, what's new? Geoff line. Geoff line has been expanded.
[40:02.400 --> 40:08.280]  Go into the Geoff line and you will see. Is this, is that Barbara with an eye patch? That looks like
[40:08.280 --> 40:15.720]  Barbara. That's definitely not Barbara. That is a woman with an eye patch. Geoff designed by Geoff
[40:15.720 --> 40:24.880]  Designed by Geoff. Geoff Ross. What? California sunshine. Okay. Geoff been East. It's the next
[40:24.880 --> 40:30.020]  line. Cause I expect the Geoff line to be a huge success. We had four Geoff's including Eric's dad.
[40:30.140 --> 40:34.200]  We got an accomplished line. What's as Trevor with an eye patch? What's with the eye patches?
[40:34.820 --> 40:38.440]  These? No, I don't know. I know. I've never seen Trevor or Barbara with an eye patch. These are
[40:38.440 --> 40:46.940]  two completely different people. What is this? Would you call an old man with a list, a liar
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.420]  video? Oh, that's a testimonial video. That is a people that have experienced the,
[40:52.680 --> 40:58.020]  not the Rooster Teeth store experience and I have nothing but positives to say. Can I play it? Yeah,
[40:58.040 --> 41:00.920]  feel free. All right. I'm going to play it. You guys won't be able to hear me listen to it, but
[41:00.920 --> 41:04.060]  I'm very proud of the store. I think it's going to do really well. And once again,
[41:04.060 --> 41:10.220]  the only name that you've committed to this is Eric Baudour. Well, as I said, I don't know. We'll
[41:10.220 --> 41:14.740]  see what happens when this goes public. How does this YouTube account have nine subscribers?
[41:15.760 --> 41:22.840]  What I used for when I did the Krampus thing. Yeah. Eric, have you had a conversation with
[41:22.840 --> 41:29.580]  legal yet? No, I haven't. But my dad is now involved, so I don't know what's going to happen.
[41:30.080 --> 41:36.120]  How is your dad involved? He designed one of the Geoff shirts. My dad is one of the designers of the
[41:36.120 --> 41:43.820]  Geoff shirts. He is, his name is Geoff. He doesn't go by Geoff, but that's his name. So Andrew asked me
[41:43.820 --> 41:51.220]  to get him to design a shirt. The guy walking the dog. Yeah, it says C.A. Sunshine. Your dad's name
[41:51.220 --> 41:57.600]  is Geoff? Yep. So I'm kind of like your dad. That's spelled completely different. What's great is that
[41:57.600 --> 42:03.320]  he's clearly started drawing the dog first, but when he drew the man, he didn't have enough room
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.080]  for the legs. So he's drawn the legs all the way down below the floor and then created a ramp
[42:08.080 --> 42:15.220]  so that it matches. I think it's a beautiful piece of art. I think all four Geoff's nailed it.
[42:15.640 --> 42:21.420]  Yeah. And as I said, I think it says a lot that this Geoff line is opening with four shirts
[42:21.420 --> 42:28.560]  and not three. I think four is better than three. It's a larger number. That's true, I guess.
[42:28.720 --> 42:36.300]  It's undeniable. Is four not a larger number than three? It is. It is. It's undisputed. I'm very
[42:36.300 --> 42:40.740]  proud of this. I mean, the shirts, shirts still to be made. Shirts are going to get made in the
[42:40.740 --> 42:46.160]  next few days, but we have an outline. Oh, please don't. No, I'm making the shirts. The shirts are
[42:46.160 --> 42:51.080]  coming. I got my hat guy on it, so there's no way it'll go wrong. Oh, yeah, that'll be brilliant.
[42:52.120 --> 42:58.840]  Oh, Christ. I thought you'd be impressed. I know it's. That's definitely got models.
[42:59.380 --> 43:04.560]  It's even models for the shirts. That's a whole other level. That's not cheap. Yeah. I didn't
[43:04.560 --> 43:11.980]  just take those from another store and then use MS Paint and alter them. Those are original.
[43:12.420 --> 43:17.420]  You have a lot of time. I don't have a lot of time. Well, this is for the show. What do you
[43:17.420 --> 43:26.020]  mean? I have a lot of time. Gav, what did you do for the show? For this one? Yeah. I showed
[43:26.020 --> 43:35.460]  Meg your pictures. And I ruined a pair of shorts. What did you do? I bought a bunch of cards. I
[43:35.460 --> 43:39.320]  don't remember buying. And then I had Andrew explain to me why I bought them today when they
[43:39.320 --> 43:45.740]  showed up. That was a short thing. You bought those on like Saturday or Sunday. I got four
[43:45.740 --> 43:51.640]  autographs of four people I've never heard of. You must have taken a knock to your confidence,
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.440]  Andrew, because you've you've come at me with two burger challenges and embarrassingly and
[43:56.440 --> 44:02.160]  publicly failed both. And you may have to eat pencils. But is there anything else that you
[44:02.160 --> 44:08.540]  have on the deck that you think is potential, like impossible to lose for you? Well, you know,
[44:08.540 --> 44:14.280]  I appreciate I don't this is the way you set that up is sort of insane because the next thing I was
[44:14.280 --> 44:22.260]  going to talk about is Garfield champ is still champ. Still the king. Undeniable. I challenged the world.
[44:22.420 --> 44:29.380]  I put a hundred dollars at stake. Nobody came close. Wasn't even close. I crushed everybody.
[44:29.740 --> 44:33.700]  Still number one at Garfield. Well, maybe maybe the stakes weren't high enough. Maybe if you challenge
[44:33.700 --> 44:38.260]  everyone and if you get beaten, you have to eat a pencil. Maybe you'll have more challenges. Yeah,
[44:38.280 --> 44:42.380]  but people aren't going to believe he'll do it now. I never said I wouldn't do it. I said I didn't
[44:42.380 --> 44:47.300]  think it was part of the bet and I'll stand by it. I'm not completely opposed to the idea of doing it.
[44:47.720 --> 44:53.440]  I did one thing. It was sort of mean just before we move on from the Garfield thing. I'm in a
[44:53.440 --> 44:57.640]  discord and a lot of the people in it were trying to beat the times they'd spent like the whole
[44:57.640 --> 45:03.060]  week constantly, like motivating each other to try to do it. And I couldn't sleep on Monday night.
[45:03.100 --> 45:07.380]  It was like two forty five a.m. I was finally going to go to bed. I was setting my alarm clock
[45:07.380 --> 45:12.920]  and I got a discord notification for a photo and one of the people in the chat finally beat one
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.380]  of my times and they were so happy. They're so excited that they did it. And I thought, well,
[45:18.760 --> 45:26.220]  I can't sleep now. So I got back loaded Garfield card up and just went at it for like 40 minutes,
[45:26.280 --> 45:31.780]  just grinding the track over and over again. I beat him by point like five, two seconds.
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.780]  And then I react as like, hey, good job. You beat my time. That's awesome. Good for you.
[45:36.780 --> 45:41.500]  Having already beaten it again and had a screenshot ready and he's like, oh,
[45:41.540 --> 45:45.780]  thank you so much. That's so kind of you. Please don't beat it back immediately. It's
[45:45.780 --> 45:49.440]  like my birthday in a day. That would be really mean. I had already done it.
[45:49.760 --> 45:57.420]  I couldn't for the first time. I was like, oh, OK, well, we should have known. Yeah.
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.560]  Happy birthday. Yeah. Here's an early birthday gift. Enjoy this screenshot. And he's like,
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.920]  you fucking suck. And instead of walking away and then going to bed,
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.240]  I kept playing and I beat his time again, this time by three seconds.
[46:11.880 --> 46:16.620]  And then I was three seconds. It was a three second beat. And then I posted again.
[46:18.140 --> 46:21.680]  Don't come at the king. Don't come at the king that way. I will shatter your dreams
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.480]  in Garfield. I got no sympathy for Garfield. I will crush you in Garfield.
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.740]  You see every every improvement on one of your times, no matter what the game
[46:29.740 --> 46:36.000]  you see as a personal attack to the point where you will put down everything else in your life
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.480]  until you are back on top. Absolutely. You're like Michael Jordan in the last dance.
[46:40.620 --> 46:44.580]  You take it personally. Yes, absolutely. I have to get it back immediately.
[46:45.100 --> 46:48.760]  Also, they were saying like the king is dead. New champion. They're all happy and celebrating
[46:48.760 --> 46:53.340]  his shit. I can't have any of that. I would have been maybe a little little more kind about it
[46:53.340 --> 46:58.280]  if they weren't celebrating. But you got to respect the king. I had to make a show of force.
[46:58.280 --> 47:05.460]  So you you're saying then, in essence, that you have not done the best that you're capable of
[47:05.460 --> 47:11.940]  doing in Garfield because you're when challenged, you are capable of digging deep, finding some
[47:11.940 --> 47:19.980]  bit of true grit inside of you and pushing forward even further to shave off tens or
[47:19.980 --> 47:26.100]  hundreds of seconds to improve on your already world record. That's what you're saying. Iron
[47:26.680 --> 47:29.900]  Do you know if you eventually beat back all my times on Halo 2?
[47:30.280 --> 47:34.500]  Wait, what? Like we were doing like Halo 2 level speed running at one point.
[47:34.860 --> 47:39.200]  This is also totally fabricated. This never happened. What do you mean we're doing Halo
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.400]  2 speed running? It was when I was trying to do Halo 2 achievements and you just got involved.
[47:44.620 --> 47:49.040]  You started beating my time. We did one level. Now we're both going for the achievement. I didn't
[47:49.040 --> 47:52.680]  view that as speed running. I thought we were just sharing times trying to get the achievement.
[47:53.140 --> 47:56.640]  I didn't know we were racing. Well, we weren't really racing the whole game, but there were
[47:56.640 --> 47:59.300]  levels where I'd be like, oh, you know, got a pretty good time on this one. You'd be like,
[47:59.340 --> 48:02.900]  that was interesting what you just said. Here's a better time. And I'd be like, oh, damn it. And
[48:02.900 --> 48:06.300]  then we went back and forth a little bit, but I didn't I don't know where it ended. Like,
[48:06.400 --> 48:11.580]  I assume you just smashed all of my times. Well, no, I mean, I'm sure I did because I've
[48:11.580 --> 48:16.500]  had that achievement and you don't. So I'm just definitely better at Halo 2 going fast. Well,
[48:16.540 --> 48:20.060]  yeah, because you did all levels. I was just getting I was getting hung up. There was one.
[48:20.060 --> 48:26.280]  There was one level where we were racing and it was like a two minute time. And I think this is
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.480]  the last conversation we had about it, actually, where I set the new record by like two seconds
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.480]  and I was doing something and then I saw you sent me a screenshot. And it was a completely
[48:37.480 --> 48:42.480]  different level that said like 20 minutes. I think my time was two minutes, five seconds.
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.440]  And you sent one that's a 20 minutes. And I just glanced at it and assumed it was for that level
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.500]  and that you had set a new record of two minutes. And I was like, this motherfucker. And I loaded
[48:51.500 --> 48:56.280]  up Halo and I started trying to beat two minutes. And I was like, this is impossible. And then I
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.740]  re-looked at it and realized it wasn't even for that level. I still had the top time. You were
[49:00.740 --> 49:05.560]  playing a completely different level. Yeah, that's just that's just me sort of like, you know,
[49:05.620 --> 49:10.900]  sharing my times. I'm kind of, you know, a general across the game. And you're like, this is a
[49:10.900 --> 49:14.480]  challenge. This is a challenge somehow. I'm not even going to look at it properly. And then you're
[49:14.480 --> 49:19.300]  straight in trying to beat time. It's like, it's like, whoa, chill. I was with you most of the way.
[49:19.380 --> 49:22.820]  And now we're just like exchanging times and like talking about things that work for us. We're
[49:22.820 --> 49:27.060]  trying to do it. But that was specifically when we were racing back and forth on that level.
[49:27.320 --> 49:32.220]  That's a full competition. But I thought you're trying to trying to take it back. No, no. I mean,
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.520]  I crushed your trials times. I'm just I mean, you may have burgers. I have literally everything
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.260]  else. Do you do you have his trials times? I crushed him in trials. Yeah, that was like the
[49:42.260 --> 49:48.560]  brutal. He's such a little prick about trials. Like he had that contest with Jack. So basically
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.900]  what you're saying is because Gavin destroyed all of Jack's times and then you destroyed Gavin's.
[49:53.260 --> 49:58.160]  So Jack, who prides himself, a guy we work with, if you're not familiar, he prides himself on being
[49:58.160 --> 50:03.540]  such a phenomenal trials player. But he's like two levels below you, Andrew. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[50:03.620 --> 50:09.200]  I'm not worried about Jack. Jack's way in the back. I was focused on Gavin. I know we talked
[50:09.200 --> 50:13.480]  about a little bit. It took me 100 days. Well, yeah, I think I think we did talk about that
[50:13.480 --> 50:18.860]  because I got some sort of freak accident time where like I didn't fall off somehow and I got
[50:18.860 --> 50:22.660]  propelled forwards. And I was like, I will never be that. It put me in the hundreds, I think,
[50:23.060 --> 50:27.440]  on the world leaderboard. And when you started challenging all my beginner times, I was like,
[50:27.860 --> 50:30.260]  good luck when it gets to that one. And you came at me. You were like,
[50:30.920 --> 50:35.400]  what happened on this level? How did you get such a fast thing? And it took you 100 days and you
[50:35.400 --> 50:40.720]  did it. So it's like every day. That is clearly the best and most accidental thing I've ever done.
[50:40.780 --> 50:45.840]  And you destroyed that. So it's like it's barely worth me trying on most stuff. Did you have to
[50:45.840 --> 50:49.740]  do a crazy accidental thing to beat the time, Andrew, or did you just shave off time? It's
[50:49.740 --> 50:54.540]  just kind of like, yeah, it was like learning the momentum of it and like how you had to hit
[50:54.540 --> 51:00.460]  certain ramps in a certain way. I will say when I get into like serious, stupid competition mode,
[51:00.460 --> 51:05.260]  it's all I think about. And then I'll dream. I'll constantly have dreams about it. And I
[51:05.260 --> 51:10.140]  put a dent in the wall I lived in previously because I was having a trials dream and I was
[51:10.140 --> 51:15.760]  trying to adjust the bike and somehow in my sleep I ended up on my knees and like I was adjusting
[51:15.760 --> 51:21.740]  like the momentum of the bike and I headbutted the wall. I put a dent in it. You were up on your
[51:21.740 --> 51:28.340]  knees in your sleep. I was on my knees in my sleep and I like shifted forward to like try to balance
[51:28.340 --> 51:33.220]  the weight of the bike. And I went right into the wall and I put a hole in the wall. And that's why
[51:33.220 --> 51:38.680]  he's better than you, Gavin. I feel like that's a much better way to live. Like you're not dreaming
[51:38.680 --> 51:46.000]  about any real problems. You're up there having trials nightmares. I mean, the real problems exist
[51:46.000 --> 51:52.760]  too, but... Oh, OK. If I'm in competition, it's fun to focus in on these things. Here's what I'm
[51:52.760 --> 51:57.960]  going to do. I'm going to I'm going to beat one of your times. No, you're not. No, you're not.
[51:57.960 --> 52:02.820]  You already tried this. We've already had this talk. Look, I'm in quarantine,
[52:03.220 --> 52:07.520]  bitch. I've got COVID time. This is what's going to happen. I'm going to beat one of your times
[52:07.520 --> 52:14.200]  in one of the games. I'm not going to tell you which one. Wait, I'm just going to sit there.
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.940]  Can it be any single game he's ever played? Yeah, that's what I was about to ask. Is it out of what we're
[52:19.940 --> 52:25.880]  talking about? I feel like it has to have been in a game that we've been going at each other before.
[52:25.880 --> 52:32.220]  OK. But you won't know which Trials game or which Halo level game. I'm just going to do it quietly
[52:32.220 --> 52:37.240]  and I'm just going to leave it. And maybe I'll let you know that it's done like a month after it's
[52:37.240 --> 52:41.940]  done. You're not going to do it. It's not going to happen. He'll be able to see he'll see you online
[52:41.940 --> 52:49.200]  playing. He could appear offline. There are things he could do. Gavin will fuck that up.
[52:50.420 --> 52:57.460]  And he'll forget for sure. And then two, could it be Garfield? Does it have to be a game he's
[52:57.460 --> 53:05.440]  already played? I said to Gavin a long time ago, if he beat one of the courses on my time or one
[53:05.440 --> 53:10.500]  time on one specific course. Do you need a pencil? Cats in the hood. No, I wouldn't. Well, yeah,
[53:10.560 --> 53:15.500]  I'd even go that far. I told him I'd buy him lasagna for like two months. As much as you wanted.
[53:16.720 --> 53:20.860]  Lasagna is like a once every six months kind of meal for me. I don't know if I'd want it that
[53:20.860 --> 53:26.160]  frequently. I tell you what I put on the table. This is when I beat Gavin's times. This is what
[53:26.160 --> 53:30.040]  he did. He's like, I'm going to get it back. And then he came back with the shittiest. Oh,
[53:30.100 --> 53:33.980]  the graphics don't look too good. This game, the graphics are terrible. I can't play this game
[53:33.980 --> 53:39.460]  because of the graphics. What game are you talking about? Trials. It's an ugly game,
[53:39.460 --> 53:46.900]  dude. Trials HD. It's always been ugly. It's an HD. Yeah, but you look back on it with fondness
[53:46.900 --> 53:51.640]  and then you load it up and you're like, blech. It's the lamest excuse to not beat times. You
[53:51.640 --> 53:56.260]  loaded it up. You tried for like an hour. We're like, this is impossible. I'm going to say,
[53:56.340 --> 54:00.720]  oh, the graphics weren't good enough. I can't, I'm done. The graphics were a bit yucky. It was
[54:00.720 --> 54:04.560]  a little bit off putting, but here's the beauty of this. You're not going to know I'm playing
[54:04.560 --> 54:08.700]  Trials HD. I can be playing any of the trials. I'm updating the Master Chief collection right
[54:08.700 --> 54:13.600]  now just in case that's the direction I go in. You won't know. It'll be brilliant. So all the
[54:13.600 --> 54:18.080]  Trials games are in play because we only did the first one. I mean, I'll gladly crush your times
[54:18.080 --> 54:22.660]  and all the Trials games. I feel like Trials is Trials, you know, if I feel like I'm not going to
[54:22.660 --> 54:26.760]  touch Garfield. It's like a way turf for me. I'm not, I don't know where I stand with that.
[54:27.100 --> 54:32.940]  I know Trials. I know Halo. Let's just limit the pool to that. Maybe Hitman. Any of the Trials
[54:32.940 --> 54:37.380]  games. We did a Hitman thing too. I forgot about that. Yeah, Hitman's included. I killed you in
[54:37.380 --> 54:42.780]  Hitman and then you never even tried. But I have, I have two jobs and you have Hitman, you know?
[54:43.260 --> 54:49.740]  Well, it's, I mean, you play Hitman all the time. Yeah, it's like your favorite game. You're never
[54:49.740 --> 54:55.000]  not playing Hitman. You're always playing it. Hitman's good shit. It's a great game. It could
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.760]  be any, any three of those. I would say you're, you probably like Hitman more than Trials and
[55:00.760 --> 55:06.780]  Halo right now. I'm fond of Halo and Hitman equally, I would say. Okay, you're the most
[55:06.780 --> 55:12.100]  disappointing thing about the Hitman thing was, and he, Gavin doesn't even know this, because we,
[55:12.160 --> 55:16.600]  we agreed this was going to be a thing that we did and then you just never did it. I don't think
[55:16.600 --> 55:23.900]  you've ever looked at the times. I had like a top 65 time on one of the levels. I somehow got.
[55:24.200 --> 55:29.000]  I was like, holy shit, I can't believe I'm in the top 100 for this. This is going to be great. I
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.620]  can't wait for Gavin to see it. Never saw it. Never even looked at. I don't think I even loaded
[55:34.620 --> 55:39.240]  up the level leaderboard to see what you're talking about. No, it's on now. It's on. Loser
[55:39.240 --> 55:47.140]  eats pencil. It's on. Wait, what defines losing? Uh, I just think I have to pick. No, that's not
[55:47.140 --> 55:53.700]  losing. No, no. I have to pick just a random future f*** face recording. And if I can say,
[55:54.280 --> 56:00.220]  no, I have a better time than you on this day, in this game, on this level, then you eat a pencil.
[56:00.220 --> 56:09.860]  That's absurd. I think I get a 24 hour window to try to get it. Oh, I like that. 24 hours. See,
[56:09.960 --> 56:16.420]  in 24 hours, you can do anything that I can't. I don't. 24 is a lot of hours. That's a lot of
[56:16.420 --> 56:21.620]  pencil on the line. He'll have to update the game. That'll take some time. Probably it could be a big
[56:21.620 --> 56:28.000]  update. Maybe he's having slow Internet. OK, yeah, you get you get 12 hours, 12 hours. It's enough
[56:28.000 --> 56:40.780]  to fail a burger bit. 12 hours. I'll take 16. I'll allow it. OK, 16. 16 hours to between me being
[56:40.780 --> 56:44.760]  declared winner and you discovering that you might have to eat a pencil. I can't wait to
[56:44.760 --> 56:49.500]  have to deal with this problem in 2025. That's the whole point. That's the that's the next thing I
[56:49.500 --> 56:54.600]  was going to mention is that I can't guarantee this will happen in like four f*** faces because
[56:54.600 --> 57:00.100]  it could take me eight months just to be any level time. And you could be on my case checking
[57:00.100 --> 57:05.860]  and be right behind me beating them back. Well, yeah, like there are a lot of times you can beat.
[57:05.980 --> 57:10.020]  I mean, I'm not like a speed runner. I mean, I'm sure there's tons of stuff you can do. That's
[57:10.020 --> 57:16.140]  easy. Can we do some structure with this? I'd like I'd like to propose that you guys when that when
[57:16.140 --> 57:21.820]  this happens sometime in the next three or four years, whenever Gavin Lux into accidentally beating
[57:21.820 --> 57:27.760]  one of your times and he announces it, that 16 like we announce it on f*** face when we're
[57:27.760 --> 57:34.180]  recording, when Gavin brings it up and then 16 hours after that moment or the moment we stop
[57:34.180 --> 57:39.220]  recording, we have to log back on and record the results and then we just tack it on to the next
[57:39.220 --> 57:44.340]  episode. So we get it while it's fresh. That's great. We can do that. It'd be like five, just
[57:44.340 --> 57:47.420]  like three, five minutes, whatever, 10 minutes. And then we'll just put it at the beginning or
[57:47.420 --> 57:51.120]  at the end of the next episode. Should we do the pencil in that section? Yes.
[57:52.740 --> 58:00.880]  Well, what happens if I win? Gavin has to eat a pencil. I've never eaten a pencil.
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.620]  Neither have I. I've never eaten a pencil. I thought maybe we just wipe the debt of the burgers.
[58:08.580 --> 58:14.540]  What would you prefer, Andrew? Loser's choice. Loser's choice. By the way, I know Eric told us
[58:14.540 --> 58:19.620]  eight minutes ago to wrap up the podcast, but I'm I'm not including the eight minute discussion
[58:19.620 --> 58:23.600]  about the intro as part of this episode. We still have 20 minutes of outro to do, too.
[58:23.680 --> 58:28.180]  That's true. Oh, yeah, we got to end the show. Forgot that was a thing. I don't know. I have
[58:28.180 --> 58:33.580]  time. I'll think about it. I'll think about what I would propose for my thing. You know what? I
[58:33.580 --> 58:37.900]  won a bet recently that'll actually help me with this. So this is this is exciting. I'm ready for
[58:37.900 --> 58:44.740]  you. I'm ready. OK, I'm ready, too. Oh, while we're talking about bets and ending the show,
[58:44.740 --> 58:50.300]  I had an idea. I was thinking about it at the beginning of this podcast and I looked it up.
[58:51.100 --> 58:58.680]  The F*** Face podcast Instagram has 1400 followers. And I was thinking about when
[58:58.680 --> 59:02.600]  part of why I don't know if people know this, but part of why Rooster Teeth was on YouTube
[59:02.600 --> 59:07.420]  is because I saw that we were within like 30,000 followers of Oprah or subscribers of Oprah.
[59:07.440 --> 59:12.280]  And I thought, I'm going to make a push to get us more followers than Oprah on YouTube or
[59:12.280 --> 59:18.300]  subscribers. And I did back in like 2008. And but it's part of what drove my desire to put
[59:18.300 --> 59:22.560]  Achievement Hunter on YouTube and kind of grow that. And I was thinking it might be similarly
[59:23.220 --> 59:26.840]  fun with this dumb Instagram account. And if it's not, we can cut this part out of the episode and
[59:26.840 --> 59:30.300]  we don't even have to include it. So I was thinking of who would be good for us to race
[59:30.760 --> 59:38.440]  to try to beat. And it hit me. We should try to get more subscribers or followers on Instagram
[59:38.440 --> 59:44.340]  than Coolio. Do you guys have any idea how many he has? Oh, he's going to have six figures. It'd
[59:44.340 --> 59:50.860]  be a lot. I'll say this. The top four photos, one of them is him and Snoop Dogg in fancy clothes.
[59:51.080 --> 59:56.740]  One is him and a bunch of lovely women in bikinis at the beach. Here's him on stage with
[59:56.740 --> 01:00:01.440]  oh, Fluffy, that comedian that's so popular. Everybody loves that dude, Fluffy.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.500]  71.3K. Yeah, 71.3K is what Eric says. I honestly thought you were going to suggest
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:14.060]  us go against one of our own podcasts in some sort of convoluted forced rivalry just to promote
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:18.360]  our own stuff. And I was like, I don't know how I feel. Oh, Coolio? Hell yeah, let's do it.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.720]  Yeah, no, I don't want to do any of that lame inside marketing shit. I just want to compete
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.640]  against somebody. The best kind of competitions are when you're competing against the person
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:33.960]  who has no idea, A, not only that you're competing, but B, that you exist. Yeah.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.660]  You think we're trying to run before we can crawl here, though? We're still not even the
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:45.260]  number one f*** face podcast on Instagram. Set your sights high, baby. I feel like that's the
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:50.640]  first battle. Keep reaching for that rainbow. We'll get there. We can't even search our own
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.860]  podcast. Oh, we're so stupid with this stupid name. You came up with it. I know. If I could
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:03.000]  go back in time three times in my life, I could go back. One would be the f*** face podcast.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.960]  One would be naming Achievement Hunter and the other would be naming Rooster Teeth.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.840]  Achievement Hunter made a lot of sense, though, in the time. If you're listening to this on a
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.440]  podcast app, to go from that moment to finding the same piece of content on our own website,
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:22.660]  just so you can see the pictures, that's like two minutes of your life you'll never get back.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:29.280]  It is buried deep in there. It is impossible. Yeah, yeah. That's why you got to get our dumb
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.520]  Instagram account. Yeah. That I feel like I keep promoting and talking about way too much. I just
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.500]  thought it'd be fun to compete against Coolio, but only if Coolio doesn't know we exist. Okay,
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:46.340]  Eric has copied and pasted the same thing he just wrote. Oh, yeah. Take it away, Geoff, in three,
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:57.980]  two... 71.3k thanks for listening, comma, rate five stars and subscribe you have to end the show.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:05.540]  Thanks for listening, comma, rate five stars and subscribe. Not our worst intro. Still the
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.840]  best one was that guy from last week. Well, it was also not an intro, it was an outro,
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.960]  but thank you for trying. Oh, that's true. I feel like this show had a good intro, though,
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.360]  as well. I feel like we nailed both. You were anti-intro. It didn't have one. I don't like it,
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:26.140]  but I'm saying I think we did a good job. With the not intro? Yeah, well, it was an intro. Before
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.260]  you end your... hold on, I'm adding to the message. Thanks for listening, rate five stars and
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:36.860]  subscribe. Before you end your recordings, I need an end sync. This isn't part of the show.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.320]  Why are you... I don't think you get to decide what is and isn't part of the show.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:50.580]  Why do you keep reading what I'm writing? I'm a little bitch baby. I like to suck on boobies
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:55.220]  and pee-pees. My name is Eric Doody Pants. Why would you write all that? I didn't actually hear
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:00.160]  what Eric said because of what Geoff said, so that pretty much sums it up. I just need a clap sync.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.420]  No. Do we all have to clap at once? I'm gonna count down. I'm gonna say three, two, one,
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.380]  then we'll clap. This is still in the show, by the way. No, it's not in the show. No, no, no.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.060]  If we're recording, the show ends on the clap. All right, we got this. Okay, ready? Okay,
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:28.440]  here we go. Three, two, one, go. No, hang on. Three, two, one. I hit my extinguisher. I expected
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:37.820]  a go. Three, two, one, clap. That's exactly what I said. It's exactly what I said. Three, two,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.020]  and one. When you play rock, paper, scissors, are you doing a shoot or is it just at the end of
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:51.460]  it? It's a shoot. Three, two, one, clap is what we'll do. Yes, which is exactly what I said. Eric's
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.220]  gonna do it right this time. All right, go for it. Okay, ready? Wait, so go or no go? Yeah,
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:02.360]  this is a live ammunition here. I'm not going to say clap. You're going to use my cadence and clap
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:12.220]  after I say one. Three, two, one, clap. Here you go. Ready? Three, two, one. I didn't do it.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:17.780]  Yeah, I could tell. Okay, you do it. And we were definitely not in sync either. Maybe you should
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.720]  say clap. Well, obviously you're not going to be in sync to each other. It's three, two, one,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.000]  clap. Yeah, okay, but then do you clap on clap or do you clap after clap? We'll clap on clap.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.800]  You're going to clap on clap. Okay, you're not going to hear it. I'm going to do it. I'm going
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.840]  to do it. Ready? I'm going to do it too. I can do this. This is going to be really easy. I'm going
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:38.260]  to say clap and you'll clap when I say clap. I'm taking control. On go. Three, two, one, go.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:47.600]  What? Three, what? Three, two, one, go. Three, two, one, go.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:55.940]  How did we not get it once? You can't tell if we've got it because you're on a delay from us.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.620]  You hijacked the clap, you fucker. I feel like I set a consistent rhythm.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.020]  Should we like extend this because it's going to be confusing all these claps. I think we got it.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:14.400]  No, we don't. Three, two, one, clap. I did it that time. I did it. Nailed it. Nailed it. I think
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:19.060]  we got it. Jesus Christ. Claps around the world. Yeah, my hands are sweaty.
