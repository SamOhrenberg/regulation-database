[00:00.000 --> 00:01.980]  At Chipotle, we also have a playlist.
[00:02.740 --> 00:04.420]  Guacamole as it's being hand mashed.
[00:05.020 --> 00:06.660]  The sizzle of adobo chicken on the grill.
[00:07.020 --> 00:08.740]  The chopping of onions and cilantro.
[00:09.320 --> 00:10.240]  We call our playlist...
[00:11.000 --> 00:11.240]  Real.
[00:11.940 --> 00:14.380]  Order now. Chipotle. For Real.
[00:26.560 --> 00:27.960]  3, 2, 1.
[00:29.580 --> 00:31.060]  3, 2, 1.
[00:32.020 --> 00:32.980]  That's what we do, right?
[00:33.060 --> 00:34.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:34.380 --> 00:35.000]  Do it again.
[00:35.420 --> 00:36.920]  3, 2, 1.
[00:37.960 --> 00:38.780]  That's pretty good, right?
[00:39.420 --> 00:40.600]  No, I'm good. My hands are sore.
[00:41.160 --> 00:43.440]  Fucking Eric! You're the announcer!
[00:44.000 --> 00:44.800]  You got hired!
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.740]  I listened to the episode yesterday!
[00:47.140 --> 00:48.480]  I was looking for a hand signal.
[00:48.780 --> 00:51.140]  And I was lost. I was just guessing.
[00:51.620 --> 00:52.860]  We just announced on Instagram
[00:52.860 --> 00:54.680]  that Eric got the gig as the new announcer.
[00:54.940 --> 00:56.720]  And then he fucking flubs it.
[00:57.260 --> 00:58.240]  Take it away, Eric!
[00:58.560 --> 01:00.780]  Hey guys, welcome to F*** Face. This is episode 16.
[01:00.880 --> 01:02.340]  I hope everyone's having a really good time.
[01:02.540 --> 01:05.060]  I'm gonna turn it over to your host, Geoff Ramsey-Gavin
[01:05.060 --> 01:05.980]  for Ian and Andrew Panton.
[01:06.320 --> 01:08.160]  I didn't finish.
[01:08.500 --> 01:10.680]  Hey F*** Faces, what's going on today
[01:10.680 --> 01:12.260]  in your crazy world of
[01:12.980 --> 01:14.760]  collections, funny pranks,
[01:15.020 --> 01:16.040]  and wacky fart noises?
[01:16.840 --> 01:17.820]  Don't put us in a box.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.760]  We should talk about one of those things.
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.800]  Hey Andrew, I didn't put you there.
[01:26.780 --> 01:28.960]  I feel like I already did a whole rant
[01:28.960 --> 01:30.520]  before we started the episode, Gavin,
[01:30.640 --> 01:31.360]  but you missed it.
[01:31.360 --> 01:33.300]  And I realize this is not the
[01:33.300 --> 01:34.540]  Face Jam podcast,
[01:35.400 --> 01:36.860]  this is the F*** Face podcast,
[01:37.180 --> 01:39.000]  and everybody's doing the shipping
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.380]  F*** Face Jam collaborations
[01:41.380 --> 01:43.400]  and stuff, but I don't want to go down
[01:43.400 --> 01:45.180]  that road, but I will say I just read
[01:45.780 --> 01:46.640]  on CNN
[01:47.220 --> 01:48.620]  that Taco Bell is eliminating
[01:49.400 --> 01:51.020]  five more items from their menu,
[01:51.320 --> 01:53.280]  and they are eliminating me
[01:53.280 --> 01:55.280]  as a customer because they keep
[01:55.280 --> 01:56.780]  removing the shit that I eat.
[01:57.260 --> 01:58.500]  And I'm angry about it.
[01:58.500 --> 02:00.300]  I don't really like that place, I think
[02:00.300 --> 02:02.440]  Jack took me there too many times, and I went
[02:02.440 --> 02:04.280]  off it. Taco Bell is, uh,
[02:04.440 --> 02:05.860]  it's, you know, it's
[02:06.340 --> 02:08.520]  a crime to eat Taco Bell when living
[02:08.520 --> 02:10.420]  in a city like Austin, Texas, that has
[02:10.420 --> 02:12.580]  just an amazing amount of
[02:12.580 --> 02:13.960]  variety. And Jack is, like,
[02:14.380 --> 02:15.780]  born and raised in Austin.
[02:16.700 --> 02:18.440]  But we still, it's still
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.420]  like, if you ask Millie Ramsey,
[02:20.560 --> 02:22.480]  the one place I know she wants to eat is Taco
[02:22.480 --> 02:24.160]  Bell, so we eat there probably once a week.
[02:24.700 --> 02:26.420]  And I have been eating a Mexican
[02:26.420 --> 02:28.760]  pizza pretty fucking regularly
[02:28.760 --> 02:30.440]  for, like, the last 30
[02:30.440 --> 02:32.560]  years, and now they've decided
[02:32.560 --> 02:34.620]  to eliminate the goddamn Mexican
[02:34.620 --> 02:36.720]  pizza, which I'm not okay with, Gavin.
[02:36.880 --> 02:38.320]  Like I was telling Andrew earlier,
[02:38.580 --> 02:40.140]  first they got rid of my Enchirito.
[02:40.460 --> 02:42.340]  Then they got rid of my Big Beef Maxi Melt.
[02:42.520 --> 02:44.640]  Now I got no goddamn Mexican pizza, there's nothing
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.600]  left for me to eat on the goddamn Taco Bell
[02:46.600 --> 02:48.300]  menu but a fucking bean burrito
[02:48.300 --> 02:50.640]  and a fucking hard taco. Is a Mexican
[02:50.640 --> 02:52.480]  pizza a pizza that goes up on
[02:52.480 --> 02:54.460]  the left side and then it goes up in the middle
[02:54.460 --> 02:56.340]  and then goes up on the right side and back down?
[02:56.840 --> 02:58.220]  Nah, it's not that cool. Okay.
[02:58.540 --> 03:00.500]  I wish it was. Anyway, sorry, we're getting off
[03:00.500 --> 03:02.520]  track. Andrew, we have not been
[03:02.520 --> 03:04.240]  contacted by your legal representation.
[03:04.740 --> 03:06.420]  No. I don't- well, no,
[03:06.540 --> 03:08.520]  I'm- well, what do you mean? For what? I got
[03:08.520 --> 03:10.140]  a variety of lawsuits going on.
[03:10.400 --> 03:11.820]  Could you be more specific, Geoff?
[03:12.440 --> 03:14.540]  In what context? I feel
[03:14.540 --> 03:16.380]  like I haven't heard the episode, uh,
[03:16.380 --> 03:18.200]  because we record these in a weird sequence,
[03:18.720 --> 03:20.280]  but I feel like we ended
[03:20.280 --> 03:22.320]  things with you refusing
[03:22.320 --> 03:24.360]  to acknowledge that you agreed to eat a
[03:24.360 --> 03:26.640]  pencil and you told us we'd be hearing from your lawyers.
[03:26.640 --> 03:27.960]  You know what? I have some clips.
[03:28.420 --> 03:29.940]  I've got some clips. Oh.
[03:30.300 --> 03:31.840]  Bring the clips. Here's a clip.
[03:32.100 --> 03:34.180]  How about this? Andrew, you owe Gavin $50.
[03:34.560 --> 03:36.260]  I do, but I'm also- I'm okay.
[03:36.580 --> 03:38.260]  Continue. What if we double down?
[03:38.500 --> 03:40.200]  If you win the bet, that
[03:40.200 --> 03:42.160]  is absolved, right? And
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.780]  Gavin gives you $50. Okay? So it's
[03:44.780 --> 03:45.820]  initially a $100 swing.
[03:46.060 --> 03:48.100]  Your $50 debt is wiped out and you receive
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.740]  $50 from Gavin. However,
[03:49.740 --> 03:51.360]  if you lose,
[03:51.460 --> 03:53.600]  you still owe Gavin the
[03:53.600 --> 03:55.420]  initial $50, but
[03:55.420 --> 03:57.740]  you must film yourself eating
[03:57.740 --> 03:59.520]  a leadless pencil. Oh!
[04:00.120 --> 04:01.840]  Oh! That was me. That was
[04:01.840 --> 04:03.680]  my voice. Oh! That was
[04:03.680 --> 04:05.240]  my voice. Bonus clip.
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.600]  Digital handshake on this, Andrew. Digital
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.580]  handshake, okay. You feel like we've got all the
[04:09.580 --> 04:11.840]  details that you wanted in there? I feel
[04:11.840 --> 04:13.600]  like it. I'm a little opposed to the pennies,
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.460]  but... I'm a little worried about
[04:15.460 --> 04:17.700]  the safety of it. Should we check in with
[04:17.700 --> 04:19.700]  the doctor to make sure it's safe for you to eat a
[04:19.700 --> 04:21.620]  pencil on camera? It's not safe, of course
[04:21.620 --> 04:23.680]  it isn't. I'm gonna win, so I'm not gonna eat
[04:23.680 --> 04:25.800]  the pencil. Oh, shit!
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.720]  Wasn't me. I reject that
[04:27.720 --> 04:29.680]  that's my voice. I don't know where you got that recording
[04:29.680 --> 04:31.300]  from. It is you, though,
[04:31.660 --> 04:33.700]  because I was... It didn't sound like me. I
[04:33.700 --> 04:35.600]  don't know. Maybe my reception's a little bad
[04:35.600 --> 04:37.600]  on this Discord call. It sounded nothing like me.
[04:37.860 --> 04:39.400]  Hmm. Geoff, what do you think?
[04:39.540 --> 04:41.660]  You think that was him? Hoisted by his own petard.
[04:41.740 --> 04:43.320]  I heard it right there. He even
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.700]  responded in the clip to the name
[04:45.700 --> 04:47.800]  Andrew. It's true. I don't... well, I mean
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.620]  I don't know if that was staged. I don't know what the
[04:49.620 --> 04:51.700]  context is for that clip. I couldn't really hear it
[04:51.700 --> 04:53.260]  due to the lag in the Discord chat.
[04:53.700 --> 04:55.580]  So I'm gonna refrain from commenting
[04:55.580 --> 04:57.700]  specifically on that. Well, my next question
[04:57.700 --> 04:59.660]  is... I reject that that is mine. Has your
[04:59.660 --> 05:02.080]  pencil arrived yet? Uh...
[05:02.080 --> 05:03.720]  For what context? Because I
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.400]  don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean? Hmm.
[05:05.600 --> 05:06.720]  I feel like... Hmm.
[05:07.400 --> 05:09.380]  I feel like... Oof.
[05:09.580 --> 05:11.640]  Kind of regretting that digital handshake. I feel
[05:11.640 --> 05:12.940]  like maybe it meant nothing to you, Andrew.
[05:13.380 --> 05:15.060]  Uh, why I don't...
[05:15.060 --> 05:16.800]  The clip you played was hard to hear. Right.
[05:16.800 --> 05:19.120]  I don't know what digital handshake you were talking about.
[05:19.460 --> 05:21.140]  I never agreed to eat a pencil.
[05:21.400 --> 05:23.020]  I'm not really sure what to do about this.
[05:23.100 --> 05:24.840]  Like, the way you're acting. I'm not really sure how to
[05:24.840 --> 05:27.000]  handle it. I was a little bit worried
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.840]  about this. I was concerned, because
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.600]  we had a text conversation
[05:30.600 --> 05:32.820]  about this issue. Yeah. And I was very clear
[05:32.820 --> 05:34.800]  then that, uh, not me. I never made that
[05:34.800 --> 05:36.220]  promise. I don't know what you're talking about.
[05:36.520 --> 05:38.880]  So as Geoff mentioned earlier, I, uh...
[05:38.880 --> 05:40.260]  I created a legal team.
[05:40.260 --> 05:42.040]  I consulted some lawyers.
[05:42.340 --> 05:44.240]  I tracked down...
[05:44.240 --> 05:46.460]  I have three law students
[05:46.460 --> 05:48.360]  at varying levels, and one
[05:48.360 --> 05:50.400]  straight-up lawyer. And I have formed
[05:50.400 --> 05:52.300]  a pan-defense group. We have a
[05:52.300 --> 05:54.340]  Discord chat. And, uh,
[05:54.340 --> 05:56.360]  we've been discussing how to progress further with
[05:56.360 --> 05:58.280]  this. So I'm fine going
[05:58.280 --> 06:00.320]  to a judge we can all
[06:00.320 --> 06:02.240]  agree upon. Some sort of arbitrator
[06:02.240 --> 06:03.880]  that can make this choice. Right.
[06:04.020 --> 06:06.420]  And, uh, I think that should be the next
[06:06.420 --> 06:08.300]  step, because I reject that I did that.
[06:08.300 --> 06:10.500]  Have your lawyers seen Exhibit
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.320]  A and B that I just played? Have they heard them?
[06:12.320 --> 06:14.260]  I have presented the things that
[06:14.260 --> 06:16.340]  you refer to as evidence to them.
[06:16.680 --> 06:18.480]  And, uh, they have discussed it.
[06:18.540 --> 06:20.300]  And, uh, they've come up with this
[06:20.300 --> 06:22.320]  document for me that I'll share in the
[06:22.320 --> 06:24.480]  Discord. It's a two-parter. Um...
[06:24.480 --> 06:26.140]  I have, uh,
[06:26.240 --> 06:28.320]  a legal doc for you
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.100]  to process. And, uh,
[06:30.100 --> 06:31.780]  I await further arbitration.
[06:33.620 --> 06:34.060]  Arbitration?!
[06:34.060 --> 06:35.740]  It sounded like a fancy word.
[06:35.740 --> 06:37.540]  Geoff, do you wanna, like, read this
[06:37.540 --> 06:39.260]  aloud for us? Uh, yeah.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.760]  The pencil-eating... R.E.
[06:41.840 --> 06:43.180]  The pencil-eating bet.
[06:43.400 --> 06:45.560]  Dear Geoff Ramsey and Gavin Frey,
[06:46.180 --> 06:47.520]  we represent your colleague,
[06:47.700 --> 06:49.660]  Andrew Panton, in regard to
[06:49.660 --> 06:51.380]  this supposed pencil-eating
[06:51.380 --> 06:53.420]  contract, uh, made between
[06:53.420 --> 06:55.360]  yourselves and our client. You have
[06:55.360 --> 06:57.320]  continued to incorrectly assert that our client
[06:57.320 --> 06:59.700]  agreed to wager, whereupon
[06:59.700 --> 07:01.160]  if he were to lose,
[07:01.420 --> 07:03.620]  he would consume a pencil, a dangerous
[07:03.620 --> 07:05.700]  and completely unreasonable act that no sane
[07:05.700 --> 07:07.460]  individual would undertake willingly.
[07:08.140 --> 07:09.780]  Uh, yet here we are, I'd like
[07:09.780 --> 07:11.680]  to point out. I'm a sane individual, I'd never make
[07:11.680 --> 07:13.680]  this, this alleged agreement. Our client asserts
[07:13.680 --> 07:15.160]  Please, sir, I'm reading.
[07:15.500 --> 07:17.660]  Our client asserts that when discussing
[07:17.660 --> 07:19.400]  the matter, Mr. Ramsey specifically stated
[07:19.400 --> 07:21.800]  that failure in completing the task would then require
[07:21.800 --> 07:23.720]  our client to orally consume a leadless
[07:23.720 --> 07:25.720]  pencil. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary
[07:25.720 --> 07:27.560]  defines a pencil as an implement
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.540]  for writing, drawing, or
[07:29.540 --> 07:31.560]  marking consistent or
[07:31.560 --> 07:33.600]  containing a slender cylindrical
[07:33.600 --> 07:35.380]  or a strip of a solid marking
[07:35.380 --> 07:37.720]  substance. Thus our client could not possibly
[07:37.720 --> 07:38.900]  uh, have to
[07:39.560 --> 07:41.680]  have to a common understanding with Mr. Ramsey
[07:41.680 --> 07:43.560]  or Mr. Free on what he
[07:43.560 --> 07:45.520]  was to consume if he failed to
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.400]  complete the initial act. Since by
[07:47.400 --> 07:49.520]  definition, a leadless pencil does not fit the
[07:49.520 --> 07:51.460]  meaning of the word pencil. Ergo,
[07:51.620 --> 07:53.560]  no contract was formed and our client is
[07:53.560 --> 07:55.560]  under no obligation to perform the
[07:55.560 --> 07:57.560]  specified task. He's getting out
[07:57.560 --> 07:59.480]  of it based on the technicalities of what
[07:59.480 --> 08:01.360]  a pencil is? Welcome to
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.360]  the law, baby! Yeah, just
[08:03.360 --> 08:05.300]  I mean, fuckin' Bill Clinton built a
[08:05.300 --> 08:07.180]  defense around the word is and, you know,
[08:07.240 --> 08:09.480]  succeeded. If a contract was formed,
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.240]  prior accounts have ruled when
[08:11.240 --> 08:13.040]  parties to a contract leave an integral
[08:13.040 --> 08:15.100]  term vague and
[08:15.100 --> 08:17.220]  undefined, the completing party is free
[08:17.220 --> 08:19.160]  to assign any meaning to the term as long as
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.220]  to coincide with the object- this is fuckin'
[08:21.360 --> 08:23.220]  nonsense. This means- these are words that put
[08:23.220 --> 08:25.280]  together mean nothing. Uh, objective
[08:25.280 --> 08:26.940]  meaning of the term is commonly understood.
[08:26.940 --> 08:28.980]  As our client is a generous individual,
[08:29.140 --> 08:30.800]  he is willing to comply with initial
[08:30.800 --> 08:33.100]  agreement, although under...
[08:33.100 --> 08:34.680]  I gotta switch to the next fucking
[08:34.680 --> 08:36.900]  page. No obligation to do
[08:36.900 --> 08:38.960]  so, provided he is allowed to choose the
[08:38.960 --> 08:40.880]  pencil he is to consume at a later
[08:40.880 --> 08:42.780]  date and time. If you continue
[08:42.780 --> 08:44.800]  to assert that our client must comply with the
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.560]  unreasonable terms that you have laid out,
[08:46.820 --> 08:48.780]  we'll be forced to take legal action to protect
[08:48.780 --> 08:50.820]  the reputation and respectability of our
[08:50.820 --> 08:52.500]  client. Respectively,
[08:53.280 --> 08:54.940]  Harvey Birdman, I believe that's a
[08:54.940 --> 08:57.100]  cartoon, attorney at law. Okay.
[08:57.640 --> 08:59.100]  Huh. Didn't expect
[08:59.100 --> 09:00.980]  that. I thought that- I thought the letter would go on to
[09:00.980 --> 09:02.960]  sort of deny that it was Andrew to begin
[09:02.960 --> 09:04.740]  with, but the fact that he- he
[09:04.740 --> 09:07.000]  basically has now admitted that that was him
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.280]  in the conversation. However,
[09:08.700 --> 09:10.860]  the definition of a pencil is
[09:10.860 --> 09:12.740]  what's collapsing around us. Uh,
[09:12.860 --> 09:14.800]  I don't know what you're talking about, and I will be
[09:14.800 --> 09:16.860]  referring to, uh, all things going forward
[09:16.860 --> 09:18.900]  as a writing utensil, based
[09:18.900 --> 09:20.980]  under my guidance. So you'll
[09:20.980 --> 09:23.060]  be eating a writing utensil? No, I
[09:23.060 --> 09:25.060]  won't be eating anything, and I'm unsure
[09:25.060 --> 09:27.020]  what a writing utensil is, but I'm
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.940]  told to say that. Well, Gavin?
[09:30.060 --> 09:30.500]  Huh.
[09:31.020 --> 09:32.780]  How would you like to-
[09:32.780 --> 09:35.080]  Well, first off- What's annoyed me is that I
[09:35.080 --> 09:36.740]  didn't expect this. And I should've.
[09:36.920 --> 09:39.140]  Because it's Andrew we're dealing with. I should've expected this.
[09:39.400 --> 09:41.120]  Huh. I'm a very honorable guy,
[09:41.180 --> 09:43.080]  I just want what's fair. As a very
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.940]  honorable person. There is zero
[09:44.940 --> 09:46.880]  honor here. There is zero honor.
[09:47.060 --> 09:49.180]  All you've done is denied
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.840]  that that was you,
[09:50.840 --> 09:52.940]  and then you've just disappeared off the face of the planet
[09:52.940 --> 09:54.860]  and come back with a legal team. Uh,
[09:54.920 --> 09:57.080]  no, well, I reject that. I think
[09:57.080 --> 09:58.820]  what you said was very hurtful, but I'm
[09:58.820 --> 10:00.740]  such a kind person, I'll forgive you for it.
[10:01.180 --> 10:03.060]  Uh, I think I'm just being honest
[10:03.060 --> 10:04.860]  and displaying the facts as I
[10:04.860 --> 10:06.920]  see them. And if we want to advance
[10:06.920 --> 10:09.040]  to having a, uh, impartial
[10:09.040 --> 10:10.920]  judge of some sorts, review
[10:10.920 --> 10:12.840]  both sides of our case, I'm
[10:12.840 --> 10:14.660]  open to that. Okay, okay,
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.940]  okay, alright. Well, Gavin, it sounds
[10:16.940 --> 10:18.880]  to me like you probably need some sort of
[10:18.880 --> 10:20.960]  legal representation yourself. I don't
[10:20.960 --> 10:22.980]  know if you want to go the route Andrew went
[10:23.380 --> 10:24.860]  or... Can I just go twos up with you?
[10:25.340 --> 10:26.880]  That seems like less effort. Well,
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.880]  listen, I'm, uh, I'm glad
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.840]  you asked. I'm not a part of this
[10:30.840 --> 10:33.000]  bet. I view myself, I
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.720]  view myself... Oh, you are absolutely
[10:34.720 --> 10:36.780]  in! I was, I was a
[10:36.780 --> 10:38.720]  facilitator in the beginning, I was trying,
[10:38.780 --> 10:40.860]  I was trying... Fuck you! I was, let me finish
[10:40.860 --> 10:42.440]  what I'm saying, kind sir.
[10:43.300 --> 10:45.020]  The point is, Andrew,
[10:45.460 --> 10:46.720]  you want, you and Gavin,
[10:46.720 --> 10:48.740]  you guys wanted to have a bet. I was
[10:48.740 --> 10:50.460]  there to work as a middleman
[10:50.460 --> 10:52.760]  to help you both agree to the terms of the bet,
[10:53.120 --> 10:54.600]  thus making me an independent
[10:54.600 --> 10:57.000]  arbiter. I nominate myself
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.920]  as the judge in this
[10:58.920 --> 11:01.080]  arbitration. That's pretty impartial. Fuck your nomination!
[11:01.340 --> 11:02.660]  That's, there's no way you're
[11:02.660 --> 11:04.860]  impartial! No, that's, no, he's right,
[11:04.980 --> 11:06.840]  because... I have no skin in this game, I didn't
[11:06.840 --> 11:08.480]  come up with a bet. He didn't come up with a bet, you,
[11:08.620 --> 11:10.800]  like you and I did, uh, he's not eating the pencil,
[11:11.020 --> 11:13.020]  you are, he's completely impartial.
[11:13.140 --> 11:14.720]  Alright, here's the deal. With Geoff...
[11:14.720 --> 11:16.940]  Andrew. Go ahead. Here's the deal.
[11:17.440 --> 11:18.060]  This podcast
[11:18.660 --> 11:20.340]  has three members.
[11:20.700 --> 11:22.420]  Yep. Three stars, if you will.
[11:22.960 --> 11:24.500]  Andrew, Gavin, and Geoff.
[11:25.400 --> 11:26.620]  There, uh, is
[11:26.620 --> 11:28.700]  a person on one side of the bet, and a person on the other
[11:28.700 --> 11:30.660]  side, and then that leaves one
[11:30.660 --> 11:32.340]  other person to be the independent arbiter.
[11:32.940 --> 11:34.740]  I'll, I'll say this, in
[11:34.740 --> 11:36.680]  the, in the terms of fairness, if you
[11:36.680 --> 11:37.820]  would rather it be Gavin,
[11:38.340 --> 11:40.600]  if you would rather Gavin be the independent arbiter,
[11:40.700 --> 11:43.860]  that's fine, but I think you're better off... I'm open to it.
[11:43.860 --> 11:45.900]  I don't think we should restrict it
[11:45.900 --> 11:47.820]  necessarily to the three of us, I think an
[11:47.820 --> 11:49.960]  outside party, or, or even...
[11:49.960 --> 11:51.840]  I'd do okay with Eric, uh,
[11:51.840 --> 11:54.060]  being a, a, a impartial
[11:54.060 --> 11:55.920]  arbiter. As the producer, I
[11:55.920 --> 11:57.860]  feel like he has to be impartial. But you are
[11:57.860 --> 11:59.680]  absolutely not impartial. You were
[11:59.680 --> 12:01.840]  claiming you were impartial in the text chain
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.020]  while also ordering writing utensils.
[12:04.680 --> 12:05.720]  I'm not having none of this
[12:05.720 --> 12:06.560]  impartial stuff.
[12:07.220 --> 12:09.360]  He did, he was on Amazon buying pencils.
[12:09.700 --> 12:11.920]  You know why? Because I was trying
[12:11.920 --> 12:13.500]  to facilitate the bet.
[12:13.820 --> 12:15.880]  I have, I don't care who wins.
[12:16.060 --> 12:17.740]  You absolutely care. I don't care who loses.
[12:18.260 --> 12:20.000]  All I care about is that it's fair.
[12:20.360 --> 12:21.800]  I feel as though the, uh,
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.700]  the gentlemanly friendship
[12:23.700 --> 12:25.960]  that we had, the three of us, over all
[12:25.960 --> 12:27.380]  these years, over, over a decade,
[12:27.980 --> 12:29.260]  is crumbling away
[12:29.680 --> 12:32.200]  due to the erosion of, of dishonor.
[12:32.620 --> 12:34.120]  And it's, it's sad to see.
[12:34.420 --> 12:35.980]  I don't think there's any crumbling at
[12:35.980 --> 12:37.920]  all, I think it's just, you know, we're, we're figuring
[12:37.920 --> 12:40.060]  out, uh, where the truth is. I feel
[12:40.060 --> 12:42.360]  one way, you feel another. This is, uh,
[12:42.480 --> 12:44.080]  this is some Trump-level gaslighting
[12:44.080 --> 12:45.780]  here, buddy. I feel like I gave
[12:45.780 --> 12:47.680]  pretty... I'm not the one trying to push for red hats.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.780]  I gave some pretty solid evidence,
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.040]  in, in my opinion. As someone who's definitely
[12:54.040 --> 12:55.960]  not impartial, I feel like the evidence
[12:55.960 --> 12:58.000]  was, you know, the, the nail
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.840]  in the coffin for Mr. Panton
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.280]  and his legal representation.
[13:01.880 --> 13:04.140]  Uh, you presented something. I don't know
[13:04.140 --> 13:06.000]  what I'd call it, but I, I will agree
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.900]  you presented a thing. This is gonna get
[13:07.900 --> 13:10.040]  expensive, it's gonna get lengthy,
[13:10.400 --> 13:11.920]  but it could, it could
[13:11.920 --> 13:14.100]  end with just a lovely, consumed
[13:14.100 --> 13:16.040]  pencil. Nah, I don't think it needs to be
[13:16.040 --> 13:17.800]  either of those. How about next episode?
[13:18.380 --> 13:19.780]  We'll, we'll discuss this.
[13:19.920 --> 13:21.760]  We'll go further. You can collect whatever evidence
[13:21.760 --> 13:23.640]  you want. I got my legal team.
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.100]  We can just, we'll come to, whatever
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.820]  our judge decides,
[13:28.500 --> 13:29.480]  I will, uh, support.
[13:29.840 --> 13:32.020]  Because I'm an honorable man. What, what you've
[13:32.020 --> 13:33.900]  caused here is that the audience are now listening
[13:33.900 --> 13:36.120]  to evidence in a legal trial.
[13:36.620 --> 13:38.300]  Andrew, first off, I,
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.420]  I think that you're right. Whatever the judge decides,
[13:40.640 --> 13:42.380]  you'll, we should all live with, and I'd like
[13:42.380 --> 13:44.320]  to, I'd like to thank you for the show
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.460]  of faith. No, not you.
[13:46.680 --> 13:48.000]  Believing in me. Definitely not you. I, I
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.200]  promise that I will weigh both sides. Nope, not you.
[13:50.620 --> 13:52.080]  Uh, with the, the
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.160]  impartiality. Lady Justice
[13:54.160 --> 13:56.240]  is blind. I have seen,
[13:56.660 --> 13:57.860]  uh, I've seen statues.
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.300]  She wears a blindfold. I would rather have
[14:00.300 --> 14:01.880]  Gavin be the judge than you.
[14:02.280 --> 14:03.740]  And my scale is impartial. That's also fine.
[14:03.740 --> 14:05.860]  But if there's anyone who would rather have
[14:05.860 --> 14:07.200]  me be wrong,
[14:07.780 --> 14:09.900]  it's Geoff. Geoff loves it when I'm wrong.
[14:10.040 --> 14:11.260]  He would, he would be
[14:11.260 --> 14:13.780]  potentially unimpartial going the other
[14:13.780 --> 14:15.800]  way. I'll be honest with you, Andrew, I'm still
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.800]  mad at him about the tattoo suit thing
[14:17.800 --> 14:19.260]  and that was over a decade ago.
[14:20.560 --> 14:21.980]  You can't assume
[14:21.980 --> 14:23.960]  that I... I, it is
[14:24.580 --> 14:26.040]  undeniably better content
[14:26.040 --> 14:27.720]  if I were to eat the writing
[14:27.720 --> 14:29.760]  utensil than if I didn't. And as
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.580]  someone who understands good content, you are
[14:31.580 --> 14:33.660]  impartial. You would absolutely want
[14:33.660 --> 14:35.480]  me to consume the writing utensil
[14:35.480 --> 14:37.580]  on the show. Did you just admit
[14:37.580 --> 14:38.940]  that you're deliberately
[14:39.580 --> 14:41.900]  like, trying to remove content from our podcast?
[14:42.300 --> 14:43.600]  No, not at all. I'm not saying
[14:43.600 --> 14:45.600]  that. I'm saying that the scenario that
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.640]  was described by you is something that
[14:47.640 --> 14:49.840]  if it were to happen, would be good content.
[14:50.100 --> 14:51.540]  How about instead of going through
[14:51.540 --> 14:53.400]  this, uh, big legal ordeal,
[14:53.540 --> 14:54.920]  we just switch
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.200]  your little forfeit of the bet
[14:57.200 --> 14:59.600]  to something different. For example,
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.700]  setting off your fire extinguisher.
[15:02.180 --> 15:03.540]  That sounds like someone who thinks
[15:03.540 --> 15:05.780]  they'll lose because they know they're, uh, in the wrong.
[15:06.060 --> 15:07.520]  So no, I don't think I need to compromise
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.680]  at all. I'm trying to give you an easy out. I'm trying
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.660]  to open a new door for you here. I don't need
[15:11.660 --> 15:13.300]  any other doors. A door of honor.
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.260]  The door of truth and honor
[15:15.260 --> 15:17.780]  is very easy to go through. I'm already there.
[15:17.860 --> 15:19.760]  I got my hand on the knob. We're just
[15:19.760 --> 15:21.580]  securing the details to advance. Andrew,
[15:21.900 --> 15:23.520]  you're gonna have to go through a door
[15:23.520 --> 15:24.640]  or you're gonna eat one.
[15:27.340 --> 15:27.740]  It's
[15:27.740 --> 15:29.240]  because he had two options, man.
[15:29.460 --> 15:31.840]  I did talk about doors. Yeah. Admit to that.
[15:31.900 --> 15:33.640]  Yeah. That's how this whole thing started,
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.600]  isn't it? Yeah, you told me you'd eat a door. I thought
[15:35.600 --> 15:37.560]  it was the funniest thing I'd ever heard. Nah.
[15:37.780 --> 15:39.200]  I never said I'd eat a writing utensil.
[15:39.600 --> 15:41.600]  I'm ready. I'll take both of you on.
[15:41.740 --> 15:43.700]  You can do whatever resources you need. I feel
[15:43.700 --> 15:45.600]  very secure in my defense. Alright, alright,
[15:45.700 --> 15:47.760]  motherfucker. How do you want this to go down next
[15:47.760 --> 15:49.600]  week, then? Next Thursday,
[15:49.720 --> 15:51.600]  we're gonna record. Yeah, I think
[15:51.600 --> 15:53.580]  we both compile what we want to compile,
[15:53.660 --> 15:55.620]  what we feel is evidence, and then we have
[15:55.620 --> 15:57.500]  a fake case. We have a little case here.
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.600]  Fake? Well, it's not like we're not
[15:59.600 --> 16:01.740]  a real judge. And then, and then who?
[16:02.180 --> 16:03.740]  And then, okay, so I'm...
[16:03.740 --> 16:06.000]  You know what? I did my... I tried.
[16:06.380 --> 16:07.500]  I tried my hardest
[16:07.500 --> 16:09.720]  to be impartial and to be fair, and
[16:10.520 --> 16:11.640]  unfortunately, only Gavin
[16:11.640 --> 16:13.580]  was an adult, which
[16:13.580 --> 16:15.380]  is a weird thing to even say. I don't like saying
[16:15.380 --> 16:17.620]  Gavin an adult in the same sentence, but I'm having to
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.200]  because Andrew
[16:19.200 --> 16:21.140]  is being so unreasonable
[16:21.760 --> 16:23.140]  that I guess I'm
[16:23.620 --> 16:25.320]  unhonorable? Sure. I don't know if that's a word.
[16:25.780 --> 16:26.880]  But dishonorable is. I'm saying
[16:27.280 --> 16:29.040]  I was being honorable. I was correcting you.
[16:29.160 --> 16:30.480]  You said the wrong statement. I was being honorable.
[16:31.100 --> 16:33.060]  We'll bring it up in a suit because
[16:33.060 --> 16:35.000]  I'm on Gavin's side now. God damn it, I've been
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.920]  pulled into the fray. I didn't want to be,
[16:37.200 --> 16:38.740]  but here we are. Eric,
[16:39.200 --> 16:40.380]  you gotta be our judge.
[16:41.740 --> 16:43.220]  Okay, yeah, I can judge
[16:43.220 --> 16:45.080]  this, I think. Do you feel like
[16:45.080 --> 16:46.980]  you are impartial
[16:46.980 --> 16:49.580]  to Andrew's
[16:49.580 --> 16:51.200]  standards of being impartial?
[16:51.200 --> 16:52.640]  I think I am, because
[16:53.100 --> 16:55.080]  originally when we did this, I was
[16:55.080 --> 16:57.300]  on somebody's side, then I changed sides,
[16:57.380 --> 16:58.400]  but now I'm really
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.100]  waffling on how I feel about this whole thing.
[17:01.160 --> 17:03.160]  So I'm curious about what evidence is gonna be
[17:03.160 --> 17:04.660]  coming my way.
[17:05.040 --> 17:06.760]  As an impartial judge, Eric, potentially,
[17:06.860 --> 17:08.220]  what did you think of my evidence
[17:08.220 --> 17:11.220]  that I brought today? You can't ask the judge
[17:11.220 --> 17:13.160]  to review evidence. This is ridiculous.
[17:13.500 --> 17:14.460]  It's not what the judge does.
[17:14.840 --> 17:15.760]  Yeah, but not now.
[17:17.100 --> 17:19.220]  I'm not ready for this discussion yet.
[17:19.220 --> 17:20.900]  The case is next week.
[17:21.020 --> 17:23.140]  Okay, so we should leave this
[17:23.140 --> 17:25.000]  where it stands today.
[17:25.060 --> 17:25.640]  I agree.
[17:26.380 --> 17:29.240]  Next week we will have our
[17:29.240 --> 17:31.160]  decision. We'll discuss your
[17:31.160 --> 17:33.280]  whatever legal term. I got way too excited
[17:33.280 --> 17:35.020]  when my law team said pridquo-
[17:35.920 --> 17:36.560]  nevermind.
[17:37.740 --> 17:38.700]  Quid pro quo.
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.200]  I'm suddenly feeling better about
[17:41.200 --> 17:42.620]  going against your law team.
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.160]  So this is Panton v.
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.120]  Ramphree. Yes.
[17:47.540 --> 17:49.080]  2020. Why don't we take this
[17:49.080 --> 17:51.160]  to Judy? Forget the foot rub. Why don't we do this
[17:51.160 --> 17:52.080]  for real? No.
[17:53.300 --> 17:55.020]  She seems very
[17:55.020 --> 17:56.740]  serious. I don't think she'd enjoy this.
[17:57.080 --> 17:59.000]  Do you think someday this will be in a
[17:59.000 --> 18:00.960]  law book? It'll set precedent and it'll be
[18:00.960 --> 18:03.020]  known as the Panton defense? It should.
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.080]  I don't see any
[18:05.080 --> 18:06.940]  way I lose this. I bet we should get
[18:06.940 --> 18:08.980]  Judy to join
[18:08.980 --> 18:11.000]  the Discord or something. You think so? Yeah.
[18:11.100 --> 18:12.920]  I should get her opinion. I'll see if anyone
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.640]  knows someone. I like this.
[18:14.640 --> 18:16.760]  We're set. Next week. This is exciting.
[18:17.000 --> 18:18.500]  So we're having a trial next week.
[18:18.560 --> 18:20.780]  Next week. F*** face goes to trial.
[18:21.120 --> 18:22.280]  F*** face goes to court.
[18:22.620 --> 18:24.560]  I'll be honest, I thought the first legal issue we'd
[18:24.560 --> 18:26.840]  encounter would be the pretend store.
[18:27.220 --> 18:28.800]  Yeah, and that's what I thought you were gonna bring up.
[18:28.820 --> 18:30.680]  Yeah, I didn't expect the first
[18:30.680 --> 18:32.640]  and the second legal issue we encountered
[18:32.640 --> 18:34.620]  to be us. Amongst the
[18:34.620 --> 18:34.900]  hosts.
[18:37.660 --> 18:38.660]  This store went pretty
[18:38.660 --> 18:40.420]  well. People seem to like that store.
[18:40.860 --> 18:42.620]  Yeah, well it lit a fire
[18:42.620 --> 18:44.500]  under the RT store's ass
[18:44.500 --> 18:46.200]  because they contacted me
[18:46.200 --> 18:48.760]  about suddenly very interested in the Russian
[18:48.760 --> 18:50.660]  F*** face hat shirt
[18:50.660 --> 18:52.640]  design. So it actually worked? Like they're actually gonna make
[18:52.640 --> 18:54.160]  the hat now? I don't know.
[18:54.280 --> 18:56.780]  I don't wanna get ahead of ourselves, but they're
[18:56.780 --> 18:58.600]  aware of it. Despite all the times we've told
[18:58.600 --> 19:00.620]  them about it. Oh, there's no way they're not
[19:00.620 --> 19:02.600]  aware of it. I did hear rumblings that
[19:02.600 --> 19:04.640]  the original response by our store
[19:04.640 --> 19:06.840]  team was that it was lukewarm.
[19:07.480 --> 19:08.440]  So now I'm glad that it's
[19:08.440 --> 19:10.300]  slightly hotter. Well, you know,
[19:10.300 --> 19:11.920]  the audience has lit a fire.
[19:13.300 --> 19:14.460]  As you do.
[19:14.780 --> 19:15.460]  Thanks, audience.
[19:16.020 --> 19:18.460]  Thank you for showing your demand, audience.
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.040]  Do we hear anything else?
[19:20.160 --> 19:21.580]  Internally in the company? Are we good?
[19:21.860 --> 19:24.240]  Do I need to worry about the lawsuit?
[19:24.720 --> 19:26.200]  Let's worry... I'll tell you what, buddy.
[19:26.300 --> 19:28.140]  Let's worry about one lawsuit at a time. Right now
[19:28.140 --> 19:30.260]  we're focused on you eating a pencil. I really
[19:30.260 --> 19:32.380]  f*** face myself with that website too, by the way.
[19:32.600 --> 19:33.460]  I should've seen it coming.
[19:33.920 --> 19:36.100]  We talked about this, so this is... I felt
[19:36.100 --> 19:38.140]  especially dumb that I didn't
[19:38.140 --> 19:40.360]  consider this as an issue at all.
[19:40.840 --> 19:42.240]  So the podcast
[19:42.240 --> 19:44.280]  came out. People very excited
[19:44.280 --> 19:45.960]  about the site, so I got a lot of attention.
[19:46.820 --> 19:48.160]  And next thing I know, my
[19:48.160 --> 19:49.980]  emails are going off constantly.
[19:50.220 --> 19:51.560]  I'm getting constant notifications.
[19:52.660 --> 19:54.200]  And I knew this,
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.160]  but I never considered the fact that
[19:56.160 --> 19:58.040]  every form of contact
[19:58.040 --> 20:00.180]  page, or if you use the chat on that
[20:00.180 --> 20:02.400]  site, would lead to my personal email.
[20:03.020 --> 20:04.260]  I have gotten
[20:04.260 --> 20:06.280]  over 500 emails
[20:06.280 --> 20:07.660]  in the last day.
[20:09.160 --> 20:09.680]  Flooded.
[20:10.900 --> 20:12.400]  Flooded with NotTheRoosterTeeth
[20:12.400 --> 20:13.640]  Store customer requests.
[20:13.840 --> 20:15.340]  That's some great engagement.
[20:15.740 --> 20:18.000]  It is wonderful engagement, but not
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.140]  necessarily what you want in your personal email.
[20:20.560 --> 20:21.760]  Dude, some of these are coming in
[20:22.280 --> 20:23.640]  minutes apart. Wow!
[20:24.560 --> 20:26.140]  Yeah. It's a lot.
[20:26.520 --> 20:28.320]  And it went on all day. You really f***
[20:28.320 --> 20:29.980]  faced your inbox. I did.
[20:30.300 --> 20:31.520]  You did a good job.
[20:32.560 --> 20:34.000]  Oh man, that's f***ing awesome.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.600]  Are you responding to everyone?
[20:36.060 --> 20:37.520]  No. I can't do that again.
[20:38.100 --> 20:39.740]  I don't want to go to Twitter jail.
[20:40.080 --> 20:41.420]  Is there an email jail?
[20:41.700 --> 20:43.780]  I don't want to find out. I've been in Xbox
[20:43.780 --> 20:45.860]  jail, and I've been in Twitter jail. It's enough for me.
[20:46.940 --> 20:47.980]  You've been arrested by
[20:47.980 --> 20:49.020]  the major domo.
[20:50.260 --> 20:50.700]  Exactly.
[20:51.520 --> 20:53.280]  That's some pretty good f*** facing there, Andrew.
[20:53.900 --> 20:55.680]  It's not the only one I did this week either.
[20:56.480 --> 20:58.060]  This is a good f*** face
[20:58.060 --> 20:58.940]  week for myself.
[20:59.340 --> 21:01.500]  I made some other errors.
[21:02.360 --> 21:03.480]  Geoff, I don't know
[21:03.480 --> 21:05.060]  if you talked to Gavin about this, but
[21:05.060 --> 21:07.680]  Geoff has fallen the Garfield game now.
[21:07.680 --> 21:09.200]  He came from my throat.
[21:11.940 --> 21:13.420]  Geoff has entered
[21:13.420 --> 21:15.380]  my turf. He's come to my corner.
[21:15.740 --> 21:17.700]  I've got some things to say about Garfield.
[21:18.680 --> 21:19.660]  F*** Garfield.
[21:19.900 --> 21:21.620]  F*** Garfield. F*** that game.
[21:21.980 --> 21:23.240]  That game's a piece of s***.
[21:23.660 --> 21:25.560]  That is not a kid's game.
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.860]  That is a f***ing evil, brutal
[21:27.860 --> 21:29.160]  piece of s*** game.
[21:29.160 --> 21:31.280]  The rubberbanding in that game is ridiculous.
[21:31.560 --> 21:33.420]  That game f***ing cheats
[21:33.420 --> 21:35.120]  and the pizza cup can
[21:35.120 --> 21:36.660]  suck my pizza cock.
[21:37.180 --> 21:39.000]  I f***ing hate it. It f***ing
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.340]  cheats every f***ing time.
[21:41.060 --> 21:43.260]  Gavin, here's the f***ing problem
[21:43.260 --> 21:45.080]  with the game, right? You can do time
[21:45.080 --> 21:46.800]  trials on every f***ing lap. That's fine.
[21:46.840 --> 21:48.900]  Or on every course. That's fine. There's like 16 courses,
[21:49.060 --> 21:50.900]  I think. Or 12?
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.660]  16? Whatever.
[21:53.140 --> 21:54.800]  But you can like
[21:54.800 --> 21:56.980]  bulls*** level your car and your
[21:56.980 --> 21:58.880]  character up. It's basically like
[21:58.880 --> 22:01.140]  this car goes fast, but has s***y steering.
[22:01.340 --> 22:02.980]  This car has good brakes, but
[22:02.980 --> 22:04.940]  s***y speed, right? But there
[22:04.940 --> 22:07.160]  is... this character is a douchebag
[22:07.160 --> 22:08.780]  and this character... but they all have...
[22:08.780 --> 22:10.880]  it all evens out. But then they offer these
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.880]  spoilers that you can unlock. And the
[22:12.880 --> 22:15.040]  spoilers do give a little bit of a boost, like above
[22:15.040 --> 22:17.060]  the normal. And you can't win...
[22:17.060 --> 22:18.960]  you can't set any world records without those
[22:18.960 --> 22:20.960]  f***ing spoilers, I'll tell you that right now.
[22:21.240 --> 22:22.680]  However, to get a spoiler,
[22:23.140 --> 22:25.180]  you have to come in... you have to get gold
[22:25.180 --> 22:27.380]  in a cup. A specific cup for the one I want.
[22:27.480 --> 22:29.180]  The pizza cup. Now,
[22:29.620 --> 22:31.080]  it's not just... it's not just
[22:31.080 --> 22:33.120]  coming in gold. Gold is like winning the circuit,
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.940]  right? You know, it's four races,
[22:35.160 --> 22:37.220]  you come out on top over the course of
[22:37.220 --> 22:39.220]  four races. No, the unspoken rule
[22:39.220 --> 22:41.060]  is you have to come in first on every
[22:41.060 --> 22:43.140]  race. One, two, three, four in a
[22:43.140 --> 22:45.100]  row to unlock this f***ing spoiler. And
[22:45.100 --> 22:46.500]  that is
[22:47.100 --> 22:48.720]  bulls***. It's not that hard.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.760]  It is. It's really easy.
[22:50.960 --> 22:53.140]  I'm not good at racing games. I'm
[22:53.140 --> 22:55.320]  not good at games. So you're
[22:55.320 --> 22:57.060]  saying you basically... you can't even
[22:57.060 --> 22:59.120]  get the spoiler that would
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.080]  give you a chance to tackle Andrew's Times.
[23:01.400 --> 23:03.060]  That is exactly
[23:03.060 --> 23:05.220]  what I'm saying. I think that
[23:05.220 --> 23:06.820]  I could beat one of Andrew's Times
[23:06.820 --> 23:08.980]  if I didn't have to beat the game
[23:08.980 --> 23:11.160]  trying to cheat against me for
[23:11.160 --> 23:12.960]  four straight matches. Because
[23:12.960 --> 23:15.120]  it's a kart racer, right, dude? So
[23:15.120 --> 23:17.100]  all the... there's f***ing power-ups.
[23:17.560 --> 23:18.800]  There's pillows
[23:18.800 --> 23:21.160]  that will put you to sleep.
[23:21.160 --> 23:22.620]  There are
[23:23.160 --> 23:25.440]  f***ing aliens that will abduct
[23:25.440 --> 23:27.320]  your car right at the finish line.
[23:28.800 --> 23:29.760]  It is
[23:29.760 --> 23:31.480]  f***ing nonsense.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.240]  It's a kart racer for kids.
[23:33.540 --> 23:34.920]  It's fun. It's not for kids.
[23:35.340 --> 23:37.020]  It is. It's a great kids game.
[23:37.560 --> 23:38.540]  It's a really well-made game.
[23:38.880 --> 23:41.040]  That game's like Thunderdome. It's brutal.
[23:41.820 --> 23:42.860]  And I don't like it.
[23:43.300 --> 23:45.200]  I'm not done with it yet.
[23:45.280 --> 23:46.620]  I haven't given up on it completely.
[23:46.960 --> 23:48.760]  We'll see if I get lucky. I try
[23:48.760 --> 23:50.560]  a couple times a day just to see,
[23:50.760 --> 23:52.480]  you know, see how many races I can get into
[23:52.480 --> 23:54.020]  on the f***ing pizza cup
[23:54.020 --> 23:56.640]  before the game cheats and f***ing ruins
[23:56.640 --> 23:58.760]  my day. What course do you
[23:58.760 --> 24:00.720]  struggle on, or are you just kind of all over the place right now?
[24:00.740 --> 24:02.440]  All over the place, man. All over the place.
[24:02.600 --> 24:04.360]  I've gotten first on three of the four
[24:05.240 --> 24:06.020]  courses, but
[24:06.820 --> 24:07.620]  only once.
[24:08.500 --> 24:10.840]  In one go-through. Well, I know you, Geoff,
[24:10.920 --> 24:12.580]  and I'd heard you're complaining
[24:12.580 --> 24:14.760]  a lot. You're constantly whining about your
[24:14.760 --> 24:16.800]  inability to win in the pizza cup.
[24:16.800 --> 24:17.880]  And I didn't
[24:18.580 --> 24:20.980]  struggle with that at all. I had no problem with it.
[24:21.220 --> 24:22.900]  I talked to other people that struggle with it.
[24:23.060 --> 24:24.960]  I thought, there have been some updates to this
[24:24.960 --> 24:26.880]  game. Maybe it's harder than it
[24:26.880 --> 24:28.820]  used to be. So I made a new
[24:28.820 --> 24:30.680]  Xbox account to start over.
[24:30.860 --> 24:33.240]  I wanted a fresh start. And because
[24:33.240 --> 24:34.780]  I'm such a good friend,
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.800]  I'm such an honorable guy,
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.380]  as I've been saying this whole time,
[24:38.600 --> 24:40.380]  I named my second account
[24:40.380 --> 24:42.500]  After You, is what I did.
[24:42.820 --> 24:44.480]  And I loaded into that pizza cup.
[24:44.480 --> 24:46.480]  I thought, I'm gonna start at the 100,
[24:46.640 --> 24:48.540]  the medium difficulty, then go hard.
[24:48.680 --> 24:50.500]  Won the first three races. Realized
[24:50.500 --> 24:52.200]  I was on hard. I didn't even know it.
[24:52.300 --> 24:54.540]  That's how easy it is. I was on hard the whole time.
[24:55.240 --> 24:56.360]  Beat the pizza cup.
[24:56.620 --> 24:58.580]  First try. No problem.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.020]  Then thought, you know what?
[25:00.560 --> 25:02.440]  Geoff is never gonna be able to do this.
[25:02.500 --> 25:04.640]  He doesn't have the skill. He doesn't have the talent.
[25:04.740 --> 25:06.500]  He doesn't have the natural lasagna gene
[25:06.500 --> 25:08.540]  in him like I have. I'm gonna be
[25:08.540 --> 25:10.440]  a good friend. I'm gonna get
[25:10.440 --> 25:12.740]  fake Geoff on this leaderboard.
[25:12.740 --> 25:14.800]  I'm gonna get him nice and number two
[25:14.800 --> 25:16.560]  so he can feel good about himself,
[25:16.700 --> 25:18.920]  but he's never gonna hit the top.
[25:19.300 --> 25:20.620]  Cause it's just not in him.
[25:21.180 --> 25:22.720]  I don't need to worry about that.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.760]  Except, then the unexpected
[25:24.760 --> 25:26.800]  happened, and I beat
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.800]  my own time by accident, so fake Geoff
[25:28.800 --> 25:29.600]  is currently
[25:30.520 --> 25:33.040]  number one on Play Misty for me.
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.260]  I did it!
[25:34.640 --> 25:35.980]  I did it, baby!
[25:36.620 --> 25:37.780]  I'm the best!
[25:38.820 --> 25:40.440]  I did that on Saturday.
[25:41.220 --> 25:42.180]  I played
[25:42.180 --> 25:44.760]  all weekend. I can't beat that time.
[25:44.940 --> 25:46.520]  I am stuck in second
[25:46.520 --> 25:48.300]  place cause I beat myself
[25:48.300 --> 25:50.300]  as fake Geoff. I like that you
[25:50.300 --> 25:51.840]  try to create these competitions.
[25:52.600 --> 25:54.380]  Either no one shows up for them
[25:54.380 --> 25:56.500]  cause they don't care, or they're literally
[25:56.500 --> 25:58.640]  not good enough, so you play as them
[25:58.640 --> 26:00.360]  and you beat yourself
[26:00.360 --> 26:02.280]  as them. Gavin, I guarantee
[26:02.280 --> 26:04.040]  you I could beat him on a time trial.
[26:04.180 --> 26:06.300]  A time trial, it's just racing. It's just you
[26:06.300 --> 26:08.360]  versus the course. Any track,
[26:08.360 --> 26:10.000]  anywhere, any day.
[26:10.400 --> 26:12.460]  But to be fair, look at those times.
[26:12.780 --> 26:14.480]  It's the kart shit that kills you.
[26:14.760 --> 26:16.220]  He's got like
[26:16.220 --> 26:18.580]  seven seconds now on the next person.
[26:18.840 --> 26:20.320]  I know what those times are.
[26:20.400 --> 26:21.040]  I've competed.
[26:22.100 --> 26:24.260]  I understand how... I've not...
[26:24.260 --> 26:26.180]  The closest I came was within like
[26:26.180 --> 26:28.300]  23 seconds of one of his times.
[26:28.780 --> 26:30.160]  And that's because I can't get that
[26:30.160 --> 26:32.440]  goddamn spoiler. I don't think that matters.
[26:33.680 --> 26:34.160]  But
[26:34.160 --> 26:36.220]  you did it. Now I'm stuck in second, so
[26:36.220 --> 26:37.260]  I'm playing against myself.
[26:38.140 --> 26:40.160]  Are you gonna go try and get your
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.000]  number one time back? Or can you
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  sit there knowing that it's actually you
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.020]  who's number one right now? No, I can't live with that.
[26:46.140 --> 26:48.020]  I need my name up there and that number won't, the gold.
[26:48.420 --> 26:49.760]  So I'm gonna keep at it.
[26:49.980 --> 26:52.120]  Everyone's looking at Geoff's name now. No one's looking
[26:52.120 --> 26:54.160]  at you anymore. Yeah, it's a sad
[26:54.160 --> 26:55.640]  sight. Can't have it.
[26:56.020 --> 26:58.220]  Speaking of bets, we kinda made
[26:58.220 --> 26:59.960]  a bet last week, Gavin, didn't we?
[27:00.320 --> 27:01.620]  We're doing the time thing, right?
[27:02.360 --> 27:03.680]  I think we kinda left that open.
[27:04.220 --> 27:05.920]  Do you feel good about that
[27:05.920 --> 27:07.860]  still, or did you actually try and now you've
[27:07.860 --> 27:09.360]  realized it was a mistake? No, no,
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.040]  what I did was is that
[27:11.720 --> 27:13.740]  it's a long game. I'm gonna just announce
[27:13.740 --> 27:15.720]  that I have a better time than you.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.200]  This is what I think we should do.
[27:17.560 --> 27:19.160]  I'm gonna chime in.
[27:19.660 --> 27:21.700]  We had some discussion about this, but I
[27:21.700 --> 27:23.860]  kinda zoned out last time, so I missed
[27:23.860 --> 27:25.720]  it, so maybe I'm repeating what we
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.860]  said. I think once you issue
[27:27.860 --> 27:29.780]  that time, how many hours?
[27:29.920 --> 27:31.180]  16, right? Yeah.
[27:31.180 --> 27:33.260]  Let's knock it to 12, because that's a better
[27:33.260 --> 27:35.180]  number. Okay. Go down to 12.
[27:35.980 --> 27:37.260]  Once you announce the time,
[27:37.280 --> 27:39.200]  it can only be one time, but once you
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.280]  announce that time, I have 12
[27:41.280 --> 27:43.260]  hours to beat it, you have 12
[27:43.260 --> 27:44.980]  hours to respond. If I do.
[27:45.400 --> 27:47.420]  And we just go back and forth until it's over.
[27:47.660 --> 27:49.340]  Okay, I beat one of your times.
[27:49.820 --> 27:50.560]  Which one did you beat?
[27:51.100 --> 27:52.900]  Aw, fuck, wait. What time is it?
[27:53.420 --> 27:53.800]  Okay.
[27:55.260 --> 27:57.180]  What time? I didn't
[27:57.180 --> 27:58.600]  really, I just wanted to freak you out.
[27:58.600 --> 27:59.840]  I was very nervous.
[28:00.680 --> 28:02.720]  Oh my god. But that's how it's gonna go.
[28:02.920 --> 28:04.680]  It's gonna be one week, you know,
[28:04.740 --> 28:06.280]  in the future, when I do that.
[28:06.580 --> 28:07.900]  I'm thrilled for it.
[28:08.660 --> 28:10.860]  Gav, just as an aside,
[28:12.120 --> 28:12.720]  how do
[28:12.720 --> 28:14.580]  you feel entering into a new bet
[28:14.580 --> 28:16.680]  with Andrew, in the
[28:16.680 --> 28:18.760]  middle of him taking you to court for your last
[28:18.760 --> 28:20.760]  bet? I'm not taking him, I'm defending myself.
[28:20.860 --> 28:22.440]  If anything, he's taking me to court.
[28:22.520 --> 28:23.180]  Look, you know,
[28:24.380 --> 28:26.600]  even if we may be entangled in a giant
[28:26.600 --> 28:28.640]  legal battle internally, I feel
[28:28.640 --> 28:30.360]  like the show must go on.
[28:30.640 --> 28:32.580]  Yeah, no, I appreciate that you're
[28:32.580 --> 28:34.600]  a professional, but do you have any confidence
[28:34.600 --> 28:36.680]  that when you win this bet, like you won
[28:36.680 --> 28:38.100]  the last one, he'll pay up?
[28:38.480 --> 28:40.700]  No, actually, because apparently evidence means
[28:40.700 --> 28:42.720]  nothing, and you could just
[28:42.720 --> 28:44.800]  hire three dipshits and a lawyer
[28:45.760 --> 28:46.240]  to
[28:47.320 --> 28:48.780]  write some crap down.
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.740]  But, you know, I'm just gonna have to give him
[28:50.740 --> 28:52.640]  a second chance on the whole honor thing.
[28:53.500 --> 28:55.040]  See if he can redeem himself.
[28:55.040 --> 28:56.760]  He's a honorable guy. Evidence
[28:56.760 --> 28:59.140]  isn't evidence until esteemed acceptance.
[28:59.140 --> 29:01.200]  Can we get a three dipshits and a lawyer
[29:01.200 --> 29:02.740]  legal firm t-shirt made?
[29:03.420 --> 29:05.080]  I would love business cards.
[29:05.360 --> 29:06.860]  I feel like maybe the next letter will be
[29:06.860 --> 29:08.060]  slightly more aggressive now.
[29:10.680 --> 29:12.460]  I came to terms with the other thing.
[29:12.800 --> 29:14.620]  That was an area we left off.
[29:14.700 --> 29:16.780]  You had your idea for your bet. I don't
[29:16.780 --> 29:18.520]  remember what even your idea was,
[29:18.660 --> 29:20.780]  but I didn't have anything for if I won
[29:20.780 --> 29:22.220]  the bet. I have my bet.
[29:22.220 --> 29:23.420]  So you're saying
[29:23.420 --> 29:26.320]  if you beat it within 12 hours,
[29:26.420 --> 29:28.260]  I then get a 12 hour response period?
[29:28.760 --> 29:29.860]  It bounces back to you.
[29:30.020 --> 29:31.980]  It becomes a volley at that point until
[29:31.980 --> 29:34.200]  whoever is stuck with it loses.
[29:34.400 --> 29:36.260]  Got it. Okay. Got it. I mean, that sounds
[29:36.260 --> 29:37.880]  fair. That sounds fair. And what
[29:37.880 --> 29:40.140]  happens if I lose this bet?
[29:40.600 --> 29:42.040]  Is there any point in us even
[29:42.040 --> 29:44.000]  discussing anything? No, I think there's definitely
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.720]  a point. We didn't come to terms last time.
[29:46.020 --> 29:48.080]  I know what I want. And is this you I'm
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.540]  talking to now? Is this you, Andrew Panton?
[29:49.540 --> 29:51.500]  This is Andrew Panton
[29:51.500 --> 29:53.040]  talking very clearly.
[29:54.540 --> 29:55.500]  Andrew Panton
[29:55.500 --> 29:57.160]  from Vancouver Island, Canada?
[29:57.560 --> 29:59.480]  Yep. Okay. And what
[29:59.480 --> 30:01.500]  do you want in return for my losing
[30:01.500 --> 30:03.560]  of this challenge? If I win,
[30:03.700 --> 30:05.280]  I don't remember what you said last time,
[30:05.520 --> 30:07.600]  but if I win, you have to
[30:07.600 --> 30:09.600]  eat a stick of gum of my
[30:09.600 --> 30:11.440]  choice, has to stay in your mouth
[30:11.440 --> 30:12.260]  for at least a minute,
[30:13.280 --> 30:15.580]  at least 10 shoes. I can pick
[30:15.580 --> 30:17.660]  any gum I want, as long as I don't tamper
[30:17.660 --> 30:19.480]  with it. At least...
[30:19.480 --> 30:20.960]  What did you just...
[30:22.540 --> 30:23.720]  I'm trying to cover all
[30:23.720 --> 30:25.640]  my angles here, because if I say you need to
[30:25.640 --> 30:27.680]  eat a stick of gum, you can just put it in your mouth, bite
[30:27.680 --> 30:29.480]  it, and then spit it out, and then it's over.
[30:29.820 --> 30:31.800]  So is the gum
[30:31.800 --> 30:33.500]  going to be disgusting or spicy
[30:33.500 --> 30:35.480]  or something? I get to pick
[30:35.480 --> 30:37.220]  a piece of gum of my choice,
[30:38.240 --> 30:39.500]  60 seconds in your mouth.
[30:39.760 --> 30:41.980]  Minimum 10 shoes. But it can't be used.
[30:42.340 --> 30:43.360]  No, it can't be used.
[30:44.260 --> 30:44.620]  Unused.
[30:45.880 --> 30:46.280]  Gross.
[30:47.180 --> 30:48.240]  I didn't even consider that.
[30:48.560 --> 30:50.180]  That'd be terrible. No used gum.
[30:50.780 --> 30:52.520]  It'd be a piece of gum
[30:52.520 --> 30:53.940]  nobody's had in their mouth before.
[30:54.340 --> 30:56.820]  Nobody's tampered with in any way. Out of the package.
[30:57.260 --> 30:57.760]  Your gum.
[30:58.220 --> 31:00.500]  I need to do some pre-research. I'm just gonna Google
[31:00.500 --> 31:02.160]  worst gum
[31:02.160 --> 31:03.700]  flavor. Andrew, can I ask a question?
[31:04.320 --> 31:06.540]  Yeah, go ahead. How old is this gum?
[31:06.960 --> 31:08.120]  I'd say any stick.
[31:08.260 --> 31:10.440]  I can pick a stick of gum. Oh, there's blue
[31:10.440 --> 31:12.520]  cheese gum? Oh, you could really make me
[31:12.520 --> 31:14.600]  have some filth. Could it be like
[31:14.600 --> 31:16.440]  a piece of gum
[31:16.440 --> 31:18.580]  stuck to like a Gary Carter
[31:19.180 --> 31:20.640]  1981 baseball card
[31:20.640 --> 31:22.100]  from like a pack of Fleer
[31:22.100 --> 31:24.620]  that's just been stuck in the pack for 35 years?
[31:24.900 --> 31:26.600]  I'm just arguing for any piece of gum.
[31:26.960 --> 31:28.060]  Can we have like a
[31:28.060 --> 31:30.800]  date since manufacture sort of deal?
[31:31.140 --> 31:32.080]  Uh, what do you mean by that?
[31:32.220 --> 31:34.620]  I just don't want to eat gum that's over like a decade
[31:34.620 --> 31:36.460]  old. Oh. No.
[31:36.700 --> 31:38.380]  I'm not comfortable giving up gum.
[31:38.460 --> 31:39.900]  I want to open up all my options.
[31:39.900 --> 31:41.900]  Starting to learn more about...
[31:42.520 --> 31:42.580]  Yeah.
[31:43.740 --> 31:45.740]  I could go spicy, as you said.
[31:45.980 --> 31:47.460]  Blue cheese gum sounds great.
[31:48.160 --> 31:49.960]  I will say, I guess I'll agree
[31:49.960 --> 31:51.900]  to this, but I don't
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.760]  want to eat any cinnamon flavored gum.
[31:54.200 --> 31:55.860]  Hey, on the bright side, Gavin,
[31:56.080 --> 31:57.420]  I'm such a nice guy, I'll agree to that.
[31:58.300 --> 32:00.040]  If you lose, you can always pretend
[32:00.040 --> 32:01.440]  you didn't do it. Yeah.
[32:01.860 --> 32:03.980]  You can pretend like you're not
[32:03.980 --> 32:05.120]  you right now. No.
[32:05.560 --> 32:08.020]  I didn't make it to Face 16
[32:08.020 --> 32:09.000]  recording, I was away.
[32:09.280 --> 32:12.000]  Who would do this? This is very
[32:12.500 --> 32:13.880]  dishonorable, what you're suggesting, Geoff.
[32:14.860 --> 32:16.000]  I'm just blown
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.100]  away that you're committing some of these statements about
[32:18.100 --> 32:20.160]  honor to tape after we've taped
[32:20.160 --> 32:22.020]  all the other stuff. I don't know what you
[32:22.020 --> 32:24.300]  mean. I'm a very honorable, respectful,
[32:24.540 --> 32:26.120]  kind person. I think we all would
[32:26.120 --> 32:26.720]  agree to this.
[32:27.120 --> 32:29.960]  Do you not agree to that? I feel like that's a pretty
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.480]  clear statement. So if I
[32:32.480 --> 32:33.900]  win, am I also
[32:33.900 --> 32:36.180]  picking gum? No, whatever you want.
[32:36.180 --> 32:38.220]  I think you had an idea last week.
[32:38.260 --> 32:40.060]  I don't remember what that was, but whatever
[32:40.060 --> 32:42.140]  you want to go with, I'm open to hear
[32:42.140 --> 32:44.160]  your ideas. Was it that you ate a pencil?
[32:44.680 --> 32:46.340]  I don't know. I mean, there have been discussions
[32:46.340 --> 32:48.080]  about writing utensils. I don't remember
[32:48.080 --> 32:49.640]  if it was applied to that.
[32:51.100 --> 32:52.260]  You could have got out of this
[32:52.260 --> 32:54.200]  in a much easier way, by the way, if you'd
[32:54.200 --> 32:55.900]  have just said that, you know,
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.120]  you could make a pencil out of cake and just eat
[32:58.120 --> 33:00.120]  it. You could have made this so simple. But you went
[33:00.120 --> 33:02.120]  down this legal battle route, and I think
[33:02.120 --> 33:03.540]  you've backed yourself into a corner now.
[33:03.540 --> 33:05.620]  No, I think, you know, we're just
[33:05.620 --> 33:07.780]  going to figure out what happens with this writing utensil.
[33:08.020 --> 33:09.480]  And if I have to eat one,
[33:09.580 --> 33:09.980]  then I will.
[33:11.940 --> 33:12.960]  Because I'm a man of honor.
[33:14.960 --> 33:15.600]  Okay, I'll
[33:15.600 --> 33:17.200]  eat gum, you eat pencil. How about that?
[33:17.620 --> 33:19.640]  Uh, like, uh,
[33:20.260 --> 33:21.440]  sure. Yes.
[33:21.980 --> 33:23.580]  Sorry, sorry. I'll eat gum, you eat
[33:23.580 --> 33:25.600]  writing utensil. Yep, I'll agree to
[33:25.600 --> 33:27.700]  that. No problem. Wait, you want to do
[33:27.700 --> 33:29.040]  a digital handshake?
[33:29.440 --> 33:31.360]  Okay, yeah. I think they always work.
[33:31.360 --> 33:32.940]  So, let's do one of those.
[33:33.260 --> 33:33.600]  Got it.
[33:33.640 --> 33:36.840]  That felt good. That was it, that was it.
[33:36.920 --> 33:38.920]  Okay. It's official.
[33:40.140 --> 33:41.320]  Now, now, this
[33:41.320 --> 33:43.280]  has nothing to do with the previous pencil bet.
[33:43.540 --> 33:44.740]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[33:48.550 --> 33:50.010]  No, this is a separate
[33:51.350 --> 33:51.850]  future
[33:51.850 --> 33:53.750]  legal issue. What is a pencil?
[33:54.630 --> 33:55.410]  Oh, Billy.
[33:55.790 --> 33:56.110]  Sigh.
[34:03.640 --> 34:04.400]  Hellman's believes

[34:06.560 --> 34:08.360]  mayo lover. So, if you know someone who
[34:08.360 --> 34:09.900]  thinks mayo equals bland,
[34:10.240 --> 34:12.300]  show their taste buds the truth and challenge
[34:12.300 --> 34:14.240]  them to try Hellman's flavored mayo.
[34:14.580 --> 34:16.080]  With irresistible flavors like
[34:16.080 --> 34:18.140]  Hellman's spicy mayo, garlic aioli,
[34:18.360 --> 34:19.840]  chipotle, and Italian herb,
[34:20.060 --> 34:21.960]  they'll be eating their words. Challenge
[34:21.960 --> 34:24.040]  haters to try Hellman's flavored mayo and get
[34:24.040 --> 34:26.040]  them to eat their words. Learn more

[35:28.700 --> 35:29.860]  Hello, dear
[35:29.860 --> 35:31.740]  F*** Face listeners. It is I,
[35:31.880 --> 35:33.780]  Geoff, your spirit guide
[35:33.780 --> 35:36.040]  for all things bathroom related.
[35:36.620 --> 35:37.820]  You've heard many, many
[35:37.820 --> 35:38.920]  stories about
[35:40.280 --> 35:41.320]  my escapades,
[35:41.440 --> 35:43.420]  adventures and misadventures
[35:43.420 --> 35:45.840]  in the terrible realm of
[35:45.840 --> 35:47.920]  the toilet and the urinal. That's why
[35:47.920 --> 35:49.960]  I'm here to talk to you today. Do you have
[35:49.960 --> 35:51.680]  a butthole? If you do,
[35:51.840 --> 35:53.460]  then this ad is for you.
[35:53.800 --> 35:55.880]  It's hard to believe that when we go to the bathroom in this
[35:55.880 --> 35:57.940]  country, most of us wipe instead of
[35:57.940 --> 35:59.840]  wash. You've heard us talk about it.
[35:59.880 --> 36:02.160]  You've heard us talk about the dangers
[36:02.160 --> 36:04.040]  and benefits of vertical versus
[36:04.040 --> 36:06.000]  horizontal wiping. You've heard me
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.880]  talk for a long time now
[36:07.880 --> 36:09.580]  about how happy
[36:09.580 --> 36:11.380]  my little butthole is.
[36:11.520 --> 36:14.260]  Thanks to the bidet that I use
[36:14.260 --> 36:15.180]  bidet-ly.
[36:15.880 --> 36:17.920]  I couldn't be cleaner, couldn't be happier.
[36:18.440 --> 36:20.020]  If it could also put a mint
[36:20.020 --> 36:21.200]  in my butt, it would.
[36:21.680 --> 36:23.220]  They don't have that technology yet.
[36:23.600 --> 36:25.980]  But the Hello Tushy modern bidet attachment
[36:25.980 --> 36:28.080]  is here to democratize the blessings
[36:28.080 --> 36:30.040]  bestowed by bidets and
[36:30.040 --> 36:32.080]  offer clean buttholes to everyone.
[36:32.400 --> 36:33.980]  It's not just me. It's not just for the
[36:33.980 --> 36:36.020]  butthole elite, like your
[36:36.020 --> 36:37.320]  old pal Geoff Ramsey here.
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.020]  It's for everybody. We can all
[36:40.020 --> 36:41.840]  have a minty fresh butthole.
[36:41.940 --> 36:43.940]  Hello Tushy cleanses your butt with
[36:43.940 --> 36:46.080]  a precise stream of fresh water
[36:46.080 --> 36:47.980]  for just $79.
[36:49.480 --> 36:50.140]  At Hello Tushy,
[36:50.180 --> 36:52.140]  you don't have to wipe at all. Even the best
[36:52.140 --> 36:54.040]  two-ply can't cut it when it comes
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.960]  to a hands-free poop experience.
[36:56.080 --> 36:58.040]  You want that gentle wash, I'm telling
[36:58.040 --> 37:00.160]  you. You don't use toilet paper on your hair
[37:00.160 --> 37:01.980]  when you take a shower. You don't use
[37:01.980 --> 37:04.100]  toilet paper on your face after you shave.
[37:04.380 --> 37:06.080]  Unless you cut yourself. But why are you
[37:06.080 --> 37:07.640]  cutting yourself and don't cut your butthole?
[37:07.980 --> 37:10.000]  Gross. And every Hello Tushy bidet
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.060]  attachment comes with a 60-day risk
[37:12.060 --> 37:14.140]  free guarantee and a 12
[37:14.140 --> 37:15.860]  month warranty. So join
[37:15.860 --> 37:18.020]  millions of happy Hello Tushy customers
[37:18.020 --> 37:20.020]  right now and have a clean butt
[37:20.020 --> 37:21.900]  with every flush. I've been doing it for
[37:21.900 --> 37:24.100]  a while. You've heard me talk about it.

[37:59.500 --> 38:01.540]  and more, I'm supposed to assume
[38:01.540 --> 38:03.300]  that they mean the Geoff line.
[38:03.600 --> 38:05.340]  The person speaking the best,

[39:16.540 --> 39:17.520]  Hey Gavin?
[39:17.860 --> 39:19.560]  Yeah? Have you f***faced yourself
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.620]  any in the last week? I don't know
[39:21.620 --> 39:23.500]  Geoff, because in my notes for f***face
[39:23.500 --> 39:25.440]  I've written down bog roll
[39:25.440 --> 39:27.580]  folders, but I don't remember
[39:27.580 --> 39:28.040]  what that is.
[39:31.200 --> 39:33.120]  So if anyone has any ideas
[39:33.120 --> 39:35.520]  on what I was thinking or talking
[39:35.520 --> 39:37.300]  about there, please let me know.
[39:37.600 --> 39:39.640]  Bog roll? Bog roll is
[39:39.640 --> 39:41.560]  like toilet roll. Bog roll is like a toilet
[39:41.560 --> 39:43.560]  paper. It's British for toilet
[39:43.560 --> 39:44.660]  paper. Oh.
[39:45.220 --> 39:47.240]  How do you not know what that is?
[39:47.500 --> 39:48.660]  That's so specific.
[39:49.120 --> 39:51.700]  I feel like Geoff and I both suffer
[39:51.700 --> 39:53.480]  from past
[39:53.480 --> 39:55.460]  versions of ourselves leaving crappy notes.
[39:57.600 --> 39:59.080]  When would you have left that note?
[39:59.360 --> 40:01.280]  What is the time frame typically on a note?
[40:01.340 --> 40:03.460]  This was left for me on the 31st of
[40:03.460 --> 40:05.020]  August. So four days ago.
[40:05.260 --> 40:07.380]  And it's underneath
[40:07.380 --> 40:09.020]  no double anus
[40:09.580 --> 40:11.340]  swapped bike brakes
[40:11.980 --> 40:12.420]  hashtag
[40:13.040 --> 40:15.000]  Geoff lies about driver's
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.940]  license price. Oh, I
[40:16.940 --> 40:18.360]  told you one time
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.080]  that it cost $1,000 to get
[40:21.080 --> 40:22.500]  a driver's license in America.
[40:22.500 --> 40:25.040]  And I had you convinced for a long time
[40:25.040 --> 40:26.940]  back when $1,000 was
[40:26.940 --> 40:28.920]  a scary amount of money to you and you were
[40:28.920 --> 40:31.160]  trying to figure out how the f*** you would pay for it.
[40:31.240 --> 40:32.880]  I think you said it was like $3,000
[40:32.880 --> 40:33.980]  to get a driver's license. Maybe I did.
[40:34.600 --> 40:36.320]  And then I just didn't go.
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.260]  I was like reading
[40:38.260 --> 40:40.280]  all the driving books when I got to America
[40:40.280 --> 40:42.260]  and then I never went. And now
[40:42.260 --> 40:44.220]  I've lived here for eight years
[40:44.220 --> 40:45.680]  and I don't have a driver's license.
[40:45.700 --> 40:48.160]  I will say that was kind of a f*** face in myself
[40:48.160 --> 40:50.200]  because you lived with me most of those early
[40:50.200 --> 40:52.100]  years and I
[40:52.100 --> 40:54.300]  definitely intentionally scared you away
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.760]  and I don't think, you know, Gav,
[40:55.760 --> 40:58.240]  I don't think we've ever talked
[40:58.240 --> 40:59.760]  about this before on a podcast.
[41:00.060 --> 41:01.940]  Maybe years ago, but I don't think so.
[41:02.300 --> 41:04.240]  I do think I should
[41:04.240 --> 41:06.260]  take partial credit for you not having a driver's
[41:06.260 --> 41:08.460]  license because I let that go for a long time.
[41:08.900 --> 41:10.200]  You didn't tell me that you lied
[41:10.200 --> 41:12.300]  about it until like eight months later.
[41:12.780 --> 41:14.280]  And I'd already thought like
[41:14.280 --> 41:16.180]  I don't think I told you about it. I think
[41:16.180 --> 41:18.420]  Becca or somebody was like, what the f*** are you talking
[41:18.420 --> 41:18.880]  about?
[41:20.640 --> 41:22.300]  You lied about that and then like
[41:22.300 --> 41:24.240]  eight months later, you told
[41:24.240 --> 41:26.500]  me, hey, I lied to you about something.
[41:27.140 --> 41:28.560]  You didn't tell me what it was.
[41:29.200 --> 41:30.060]  So I was like
[41:30.060 --> 41:31.860]  wrecking my brain. I was like, when? And you were like,
[41:31.860 --> 41:33.820]  since the day you moved here and
[41:33.820 --> 41:35.720]  today, I told you a major
[41:35.720 --> 41:37.880]  lie. And I think it was actually to
[41:37.880 --> 41:39.760]  get back at me for the freaking
[41:39.760 --> 41:41.820]  tattoo suit thing. It was, but it
[41:41.820 --> 41:43.840]  didn't fit. It didn't work. I still am mad about
[41:43.840 --> 41:45.800]  it. It turned out to be a f***ing face
[41:45.800 --> 41:47.840]  on you. But I remember thinking like, oh,
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.660]  you know, I've just moved countries.
[41:49.780 --> 41:51.280]  I don't have any stuff here.
[41:51.720 --> 41:53.860]  I don't have any credit. It's so hard to buy things.
[41:53.920 --> 41:55.420]  So I need to like save up cash.
[41:55.620 --> 41:57.680]  And I was just like, yeah, I guess I'll just
[41:57.680 --> 41:58.980]  wait until I get my license.
[41:58.980 --> 42:01.180]  I ride with Geoff
[42:01.180 --> 42:03.220]  sometimes, so I probably bought other, you know,
[42:03.420 --> 42:04.040]  essentials.
[42:04.580 --> 42:07.020]  And then I just never got a driver's
[42:07.020 --> 42:09.440]  license. I never realized I f***ing
[42:09.440 --> 42:10.780]  faced myself until right now.
[42:11.100 --> 42:12.840]  Yeah, you thought you were screwing me over.
[42:12.900 --> 42:15.100]  You screwed you and everyone else over.
[42:15.640 --> 42:16.280]  I'm sorry.
[42:16.800 --> 42:18.460]  You f***ing faced like half of Austin.
[42:18.880 --> 42:20.960]  I did, I did. Oh, man.
[42:21.400 --> 42:23.340]  I feel like it's still Gavin's
[42:23.340 --> 42:25.100]  f***ing facing because he didn't do
[42:25.100 --> 42:27.020]  any research. He didn't look into
[42:27.020 --> 42:28.680]  it at all. It's just like that. I don't
[42:28.680 --> 42:30.960]  imagine. My research was talking to
[42:30.960 --> 42:32.900]  a friend that I trusted, and that was my
[42:32.900 --> 42:34.540]  first mistake. You trusted Geoff?
[42:35.220 --> 42:36.960]  Yeah, kind of. You know, we were talking about
[42:36.960 --> 42:38.140]  other serious stuff. He was like,
[42:38.460 --> 42:40.920]  he was telling me all this
[42:40.920 --> 42:42.940]  valuable information like you want to, you know,
[42:43.500 --> 42:44.920]  401k, do it as early as
[42:44.920 --> 42:46.920]  possible. Do it as young as possible. Get retirement
[42:46.920 --> 42:48.860]  going now, today. And I was like, oh,
[42:48.920 --> 42:50.960]  God. And then you're like, driving is really
[42:50.960 --> 42:51.780]  expensive here, though.
[42:55.960 --> 42:57.000]  How much does it actually cost?
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.640]  How much does it cost to take a driving test here?
[42:58.880 --> 43:01.140]  I have no f***ing clue. 50 bucks? I don't know.
[43:01.340 --> 43:03.080]  It's not. It's a low amount.
[43:03.600 --> 43:04.400]  Like, I don't know.
[43:05.040 --> 43:07.180]  Eric, do you know? Have you gotten a driver's
[43:07.180 --> 43:09.080]  test recently? It's like, gotta
[43:09.080 --> 43:11.160]  be less than 100 bucks. Yeah, it's
[43:11.160 --> 43:12.980]  gotta be pretty cheap, but no, I haven't gotten
[43:12.980 --> 43:14.060]  a driver's test recently.
[43:14.700 --> 43:16.040]  But it's not $3,000.
[43:17.580 --> 43:18.920]  Did you assume that that was
[43:18.920 --> 43:21.020]  a one-time thing for like the test? Like, you know,
[43:21.100 --> 43:23.140]  you can fail the test. Can you imagine failing
[43:23.140 --> 43:25.200]  a $3,000 driving test?
[43:25.200 --> 43:26.340]  That's why it's such a big deal.
[43:26.800 --> 43:28.780]  I don't know. Looking back on it,
[43:28.820 --> 43:30.780]  I'm an idiot for believing it, but it was just like
[43:30.780 --> 43:32.800]  information overload. Like, we were talking about all the
[43:32.800 --> 43:34.560]  differences between our country. $25?
[43:34.940 --> 43:36.420]  Are you serious? It's $25?
[43:37.960 --> 43:39.040]  If you're between the
[43:39.040 --> 43:41.140]  ages of 15
[43:41.140 --> 43:42.520]  and 18, the cost is $16.
[43:42.960 --> 43:44.940]  If you're 18 to 85, the cost is
[43:44.940 --> 43:46.700]  $25. Why is it more for me?
[43:47.680 --> 43:48.360]  Because you're an idiot.
[43:49.520 --> 43:49.660]  Well,
[43:50.860 --> 43:51.880]  if you wait
[43:51.880 --> 43:53.620]  if you wait until you're over
[43:53.620 --> 43:54.940]  85, it is $9.
[43:55.360 --> 43:56.660]  Oh, there you go.
[43:58.640 --> 43:59.920]  You need to wait.
[44:00.040 --> 44:02.200]  You need to wait until you're past that age.
[44:02.500 --> 44:04.160]  First day you're past, you take that test.
[44:04.220 --> 44:05.880]  Are we talking written? Did you at least do
[44:05.880 --> 44:08.020]  the written test? Or is this just to do the writing
[44:08.020 --> 44:10.000]  test? It was so off-putting. I didn't do
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.260]  anything further
[44:11.720 --> 44:13.460]  in my driving endeavor.
[44:13.540 --> 44:15.360]  But you're aware there are multiple tests, right?
[44:15.980 --> 44:16.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:17.160 --> 44:19.680]  So do you think one cost for all of them?
[44:19.680 --> 44:21.820]  Or each time, like $3,000 for
[44:21.820 --> 44:23.720]  written, $3,000 for driving?
[44:23.720 --> 44:25.620]  No, I assumed it was $3,000 for
[44:25.620 --> 44:27.860]  the practical license.
[44:28.100 --> 44:28.220]  Oh, okay.
[44:28.880 --> 44:31.780]  I gotta say, I realized that I
[44:31.780 --> 44:33.960]  unintentionally fucked myself into making
[44:33.960 --> 44:35.920]  myself drive you around town
[44:35.920 --> 44:38.060]  for years still, honestly.
[44:38.460 --> 44:39.780]  I mean, we're in
[44:39.780 --> 44:41.900]  a pandemic, so we're not seeing each other. But if we were,
[44:41.960 --> 44:43.820]  I'd still be driving your dumb ass around.
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.660]  But, I have to say,
[44:47.660 --> 44:49.660]  and that was back in my drinking days, so I don't have the best
[44:49.660 --> 44:51.640]  memory of it, but, coming
[44:51.640 --> 44:53.600]  to you and telling you that I've been lying to you about
[44:53.600 --> 44:55.560]  something major for eight months is a really
[44:55.560 --> 44:57.760]  funny, cool thing to do. And I'm very
[44:57.760 --> 44:59.820]  proud that I did that. That's fuckin' cool.
[44:59.920 --> 45:01.180]  And it just came out of nowhere.
[45:01.440 --> 45:03.600]  You were just like, I guess you remembered that line,
[45:03.700 --> 45:05.820]  you were just like, I've lied to you.
[45:05.920 --> 45:07.640]  And I was, honestly, for
[45:07.640 --> 45:09.660]  months, I was just wracking my brain. I was
[45:09.660 --> 45:11.200]  like, what's all this stuff?
[45:11.640 --> 45:13.620]  And I was like, is it something small? And you were like,
[45:13.700 --> 45:15.420]  no, no, it's major.
[45:16.820 --> 45:17.420]  Man,
[45:18.020 --> 45:19.520]  that reminds me, fuck, that's awesome,
[45:19.700 --> 45:21.620]  I didn't fuck myself this week,
[45:22.160 --> 45:23.260]  uh, fuckface myself,
[45:23.400 --> 45:25.400]  I didn't fuck myself or fuckface myself this week,
[45:25.560 --> 45:27.320]  but I fuckin'
[45:27.480 --> 45:29.560]  almost did with a fuckface
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.060]  from
[45:32.100 --> 45:33.600]  32 years ago.
[45:33.980 --> 45:34.840]  33 years ago.
[45:37.280 --> 45:39.640]  when I was like, 9 or 10,
[45:40.320 --> 45:41.760]  I made a blow dart
[45:41.760 --> 45:43.500]  out of a pencil and
[45:43.500 --> 45:44.520]  some nails,
[45:46.200 --> 45:47.700]  and it was, uh,
[45:48.280 --> 45:49.420]  it was, uh,
[45:49.420 --> 45:50.820]  I was just fuckin' around in the bathroom,
[45:51.060 --> 45:53.460]  and I was shooting nails out of the blow dart
[45:53.460 --> 45:55.120]  gun at the
[45:55.120 --> 45:57.360]  I was trying to break the mirror in my
[45:57.360 --> 45:58.600]  fuckin' house, I don't know why.
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.540]  I was trying to break the bathroom mirror by shooting nails at it.
[46:01.600 --> 46:03.320]  Sorry, did we transition to what,
[46:03.460 --> 46:05.620]  is this, what age are you?
[46:06.320 --> 46:07.400]  I'm like 10, 9 or 10.
[46:07.420 --> 46:09.480]  Okay, you're still a kid. For a moment, I thought we had
[46:09.480 --> 46:11.420]  now transitioned to present day.
[46:11.420 --> 46:13.580]  You still had the blow dart, and you're still
[46:13.580 --> 46:14.940]  trying to break the mirror in the bathroom.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.960]  I've been trying for 30 years, I can't do it.
[46:17.400 --> 46:19.620]  Uh, it's one of those things where it's like, you realize
[46:19.620 --> 46:21.560]  like, I would have gotten in so much fuckin'
[46:21.640 --> 46:22.920]  trouble. I did get in so much trouble.
[46:23.160 --> 46:25.420]  But I would have gotten in so much different trouble if I had
[46:25.420 --> 46:27.420]  shattered a bathroom mirror. I don't know
[46:27.420 --> 46:28.960]  why that made sense to me at the time.
[46:29.060 --> 46:31.420]  But anyway, I was trying to do it. And in the
[46:31.420 --> 46:33.020]  process of doing it, the,
[46:33.300 --> 46:35.500]  I had a misfire, and I
[46:35.500 --> 46:37.340]  had the, and the nail was like kinda
[46:37.340 --> 46:39.300]  hanging out the edge of the blow dart, and so I
[46:39.300 --> 46:41.100]  tried to suck it back up to
[46:41.100 --> 46:43.360]  blow it again. No! Yeah.
[46:43.960 --> 46:45.280]  So what I did was I
[46:45.840 --> 46:46.720]  inhaled a nail.
[46:47.800 --> 46:48.720]  And it was
[46:49.300 --> 46:51.280]  stuck in my throat, like
[46:51.280 --> 46:53.120]  poking into the side of my
[46:53.120 --> 46:55.640]  fuckin' throat. And so
[46:55.640 --> 46:57.360]  I, like, and every time
[46:57.360 --> 46:58.520]  I tried to swallow, or
[46:59.300 --> 47:01.240]  every time I tried to swallow, I could feel the nail
[47:01.240 --> 47:03.440]  like, digging into my, the inside
[47:03.440 --> 47:04.960]  of my fuckin' windpipe. Oh, Jesus Christ!
[47:06.200 --> 47:07.340]  And it was terrifying
[47:07.340 --> 47:08.880]  and painful in a way that I hope
[47:09.400 --> 47:10.620]  you don't have to feel.
[47:12.520 --> 47:13.300]  So, I went to
[47:13.300 --> 47:14.980]  my mom, and I was like, I ate a nail!
[47:15.260 --> 47:17.260]  You know, and she's like, don't swallow it, what are you doing? And I'm like,
[47:17.300 --> 47:19.260]  it hurts to swallow, it's stabbing me.
[47:19.320 --> 47:21.260]  You know, and she's like, oh my god, oh my god, lay
[47:21.260 --> 47:23.320]  down. And so, like, she put me in the back of the car, and she made
[47:23.320 --> 47:25.160]  me lay down, and we went straight to the emergency
[47:25.160 --> 47:26.460]  room. And
[47:27.220 --> 47:29.060]  they had, they got, I had to get x-rays
[47:29.060 --> 47:30.900]  of my fuckin' chest and my, everything,
[47:31.200 --> 47:33.220]  and sure enough, there was a nail wedged in
[47:33.220 --> 47:35.440]  my throat, and they like,
[47:35.440 --> 47:37.460]  I don't remember, I'm a little
[47:37.460 --> 47:39.620]  hazy on this part, but they like
[47:39.620 --> 47:40.800]  shook me or something?
[47:41.280 --> 47:43.120]  Anyway, they got the nail out of my throat.
[47:43.120 --> 47:45.720]  Oh yeah, the old nail shake. Everyone's favorite
[47:45.720 --> 47:47.500]  doctor maneuver. They got the nail out
[47:47.500 --> 47:49.400]  of my throat somehow, and I could finally breathe again.
[47:49.500 --> 47:51.060]  And then it was just in me.
[47:51.580 --> 47:53.460]  And my mom was like, what the fuck
[47:53.460 --> 47:55.240]  do we do now? And the doctor goes,
[47:55.900 --> 47:57.520]  it'll probably come out
[47:57.520 --> 47:59.340]  in the next few days in his
[47:59.340 --> 48:01.720]  stool. If it doesn't,
[48:01.820 --> 48:03.620]  we'll probably know in another way.
[48:04.860 --> 48:05.260]  Ugh.
[48:05.800 --> 48:07.640]  And she goes, so what do we do?
[48:07.660 --> 48:09.740]  And he goes, just, just like
[48:09.740 --> 48:11.900]  go about your day, live normally,
[48:12.520 --> 48:13.620]  uh, and then every time
[48:13.620 --> 48:15.580]  he takes a shit, look through it,
[48:15.620 --> 48:17.440]  I guess, until you see the nail come out,
[48:17.440 --> 48:18.380]  and then you'll know you're good.
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.700]  Well I, so for like a week after
[48:21.700 --> 48:23.680]  that, or maybe a little bit longer, I would have
[48:23.680 --> 48:25.680]  to like investigate my poop every time
[48:25.680 --> 48:27.720]  I pooped to see if there was a nail sticking out
[48:27.720 --> 48:29.740]  of it. And there never was.
[48:30.380 --> 48:31.480]  Fast forward to last week,
[48:31.480 --> 48:32.660]  I had to get an MRI.
[48:33.680 --> 48:35.560]  And an MRI...
[48:35.560 --> 48:37.480]  What does the M stand for in MRI,
[48:37.640 --> 48:39.160]  Geoff? It stands for magnet.
[48:40.020 --> 48:40.780]  Or magnetic.
[48:41.160 --> 48:43.500]  Where they stick you in, looks like a
[48:43.500 --> 48:45.620]  like a 70s sci-fi machine,
[48:45.800 --> 48:47.520]  kind of like a CAT scan, and then it
[48:47.520 --> 48:49.480]  whirls around in a circle all around you
[48:49.480 --> 48:51.380]  in a really close space and you can't move one
[48:51.380 --> 48:52.860]  muscle for 30 minutes.
[48:53.360 --> 48:55.420]  While it takes a magnetic
[48:55.420 --> 48:56.940]  image of your...
[48:56.940 --> 48:59.360]  I don't know exactly, they explained it,
[48:59.360 --> 49:01.300]  it sounded like science class, I was
[49:01.300 --> 49:02.220]  bored, but
[49:03.080 --> 49:05.120]  the problem is, it's highly magnetized.
[49:05.440 --> 49:07.320]  So if you have any old fillings
[49:07.320 --> 49:09.180]  or if you have any
[49:09.180 --> 49:10.960]  metal in your head or
[49:12.140 --> 49:13.360]  that it can pull
[49:13.360 --> 49:14.820]  it out and, you know,
[49:15.280 --> 49:17.280]  go through you and into the
[49:17.280 --> 49:18.920]  it could fucking, it could wreck you.
[49:19.020 --> 49:21.140]  I imagine you would explode
[49:21.660 --> 49:22.680]  like in a cartoon.
[49:23.440 --> 49:25.140]  And so they go through all the things,
[49:25.220 --> 49:27.320]  and I'm like, and it was a big deal because I
[49:27.320 --> 49:29.220]  have, you know, I have that reconstructed jaw
[49:29.220 --> 49:31.220]  and I have like 22 screws in my mouth
[49:31.220 --> 49:33.260]  and I have some metal lattice work and stuff, and there was
[49:33.260 --> 49:35.520]  a lot of debate over whether the
[49:35.520 --> 49:37.160]  screws are definitely titanium
[49:37.160 --> 49:39.320]  but whether the lattice work would have
[49:39.320 --> 49:41.320]  some sort of other
[49:41.320 --> 49:43.220]  metal components because I got it done in the
[49:43.220 --> 49:45.140]  90s and it was the dark
[49:45.140 --> 49:47.400]  ages in the 90s and there can't
[49:47.400 --> 49:49.500]  guarantee that there wasn't some other kinds of metal
[49:49.500 --> 49:51.080]  in the... Anyway, so
[49:51.080 --> 49:53.200]  they gave me like a little ball to squeeze
[49:53.600 --> 49:55.320]  and he was like, the second you feel your
[49:55.320 --> 49:57.240]  face pulling up, squeeze that ball
[49:57.240 --> 49:59.040]  and hopefully we'll stop it in time before you explode.
[49:59.420 --> 50:01.220]  Hopefully. And so I'm laying
[50:01.220 --> 50:03.340]  there and I'm just like feeling my
[50:03.340 --> 50:05.320]  teeth and feeling my face and just like
[50:05.320 --> 50:06.960]  waiting for anything to feel magnetic
[50:06.960 --> 50:09.040]  and then it hit me
[50:09.040 --> 50:11.280]  I hadn't thought about it for 20 years
[50:11.280 --> 50:13.120]  there might be a
[50:13.120 --> 50:15.320]  fucking missile in my stomach
[50:15.320 --> 50:17.240]  still and I might just be
[50:17.240 --> 50:19.200]  laying here and then suddenly I feel like a
[50:19.200 --> 50:21.340]  like a gurgle and then a
[50:21.340 --> 50:23.400]  30 year old nail shoots
[50:23.400 --> 50:24.720]  through my stomach
[50:25.240 --> 50:27.460]  and out my
[50:27.460 --> 50:29.380]  belly button and into the thing and then
[50:29.380 --> 50:31.040]  I just fucking deflate like a balloon
[50:31.780 --> 50:33.440]  and so I had to lay in there
[50:33.440 --> 50:35.120]  for 40 minutes
[50:35.120 --> 50:37.340]  while I just was
[50:37.940 --> 50:39.400]  perfectly still and
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.340]  just tried to feel if the nail was
[50:41.340 --> 50:43.320]  moving around in my stomach and it didn't
[50:43.320 --> 50:45.420]  I must have shit that nail out a long time ago
[50:45.420 --> 50:47.440]  but I didn't know
[50:47.440 --> 50:49.320]  and I had forgotten about it until I was 10
[50:49.320 --> 50:50.720]  minutes into that MRI
[50:51.360 --> 50:54.260]  I'm just I'm just gonna say I'm happy to be here with you right now
[50:56.620 --> 50:58.460]  Being in the in the machine
[51:01.220 --> 51:06.880]  Yeah, I just got I had to fill out so much paperwork Gavin about anything that could possibly be in me
[51:06.880 --> 51:12.060]  I called my mom. I was like what about this? What about this? No the whole deal. I was super paranoid about it
[51:12.060 --> 51:14.680]  I took off all like everything and yeah
[51:14.680 --> 51:19.520]  And then I just slipped my mind until I was laying in there with my thoughts trying to feel my fillings
[51:19.520 --> 51:26.560]  That means she also forgot about the nail. Yeah. Well, that's insane. I'm just her only child. Why would she remember?
[51:26.700 --> 51:31.980]  I like that you shat you potentially shat a nail without I must have I must have because it didn't come out this time
[51:31.980 --> 51:32.940]  How big was the nail?
[51:33.780 --> 51:39.640]  I want to say it was like inch and a half long. Okay, two inches long
[51:40.240 --> 51:44.740]  Not awful like maybe from your knuckle to the top of your finger, you know your first
[51:44.740 --> 51:49.400]  Yeah, like not your baby knuckle, but like your real like punch, you know, yeah
[51:50.240 --> 51:55.620]  Anyway, but I'm happy to say I'm alive and I survived and another fun thing about it
[51:55.620 --> 51:59.360]  This is where my body faced me on the other end
[51:59.360 --> 52:00.980]  I got the results of the MRI, you know
[52:00.980 --> 52:03.860]  Because I thought I because my shoulder doesn't work anymore and because I'm yeah
[52:03.860 --> 52:09.340]  I'm left-handed and it's my left side and I can only lift like three pounds and I'm useless as a human being
[52:10.180 --> 52:16.360]  Turns out I didn't fuck up my rotator cuff. I just have a whole bunch of old people arthritis
[52:17.280 --> 52:25.300]  Arthritis arthritis in my shoulder and my chest a good case of arthritis as the doctor said or the orthopedist said he said
[52:25.300 --> 52:30.540]  Wow, yeah got yourself a hefty hefty case of arthritis there for a young guy like you
[52:31.820 --> 52:37.400]  Yeah, I like that whenever you do an injury or you have a condition it's always to its like maximum extent
[52:37.400 --> 52:43.320]  Like when you ripped your thumb tendon open so much that he was like the doctor was like, oh no
[52:43.320 --> 52:44.980]  No, so much less than
[52:45.880 --> 52:49.960]  These two things that could have happened because there's two ways to cut your tendon
[52:49.960 --> 52:54.240]  You can cut it long ways across the tendon like down the length of it
[52:54.240 --> 52:59.200]  Which is good because it's easier for us to sew that together or you can sever it in half
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.460]  Right where we have to reconnect it like, you know, like you cut a pencil in half
[53:03.460 --> 53:06.480]  Like say you were gonna eat a pencil. You didn't want to eat it a long pencil
[53:06.480 --> 53:07.640]  You'd cut it in half, right?
[53:08.100 --> 53:12.520]  And I go which way did I cut my finger that I cut my tendon and he goes oh no
[53:12.520 --> 53:18.400]  No, no, no, son. He called me son. He goes son yours is so much worse than that and I go
[53:18.400 --> 53:22.220]  there's only two ways how could it be worse and he goes yours is uh
[53:23.940 --> 53:24.340]  Shredded
[53:25.800 --> 53:28.140]  He goes yours is more mangled than cut
[53:30.160 --> 53:33.840]  And that's why my thumb doesn't work totally but uh, but yeah anyway, so
[53:34.440 --> 53:40.080]  I'm well, I was posture related. You were right in your diagnosis your your posture. That's what triggered the whole shoulder thing, right?
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.780]  Yeah, I just like the way you're changing you're sitting flared it up flared it up, correct
[53:44.780 --> 53:49.340]  And wow, yeah, what a twist that is what a twist. Yeah, that's this is old age for you
[53:49.340 --> 53:52.300]  This is what's gonna happen to you guys. I think we've learned a lot today. We've learned a lot
[53:52.300 --> 53:57.800]  We never figured out what bog roll folders meant, but you know, maybe maybe in future that will come back to me
[53:57.800 --> 54:03.680]  Do you think you were trying to fold toilet paper or were you keeping a folder of information about toilet paper?
[54:04.060 --> 54:06.700]  I just don't know. I just don't know Geoff
[54:07.240 --> 54:09.020]  It should be coming back to me, but it's not
[54:09.640 --> 54:12.180]  Maybe it's because I'm in I'm now in a tense legal case
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.940]  Maybe do you ever get do you ever get your house cleaned sometimes?
[54:16.060 --> 54:21.360]  And then they'll like they or go to a hotel where they fold the toilet paper into like a seashell or something
[54:21.360 --> 54:23.060]  Do you think maybe you were thinking of like?
[54:23.620 --> 54:27.240]  Fancy shapes that they turn toilet paper into yeah, I've definitely seen it folded into a point
[54:27.240 --> 54:30.000]  But I don't know why that would have anything to do with the fuck face
[54:30.840 --> 54:33.340]  I'll sit on it. I'll sit on it for a week fair enough fair enough
[54:33.340 --> 54:37.640]  If you while you're doing that also if you could figure out what the greatest minecraft let's play of all time is I'd appreciate
[54:37.640 --> 54:40.820]  Okay, yeah, we'll do that's the one I can't remember
[54:44.900 --> 54:45.260]  Andrew
[54:47.140 --> 54:51.580]  I'm excited. I'm excited for you to eat this pencil. I'm not gonna be eating any writing utensils
[54:51.580 --> 54:56.520]  I sounds like you there's a good chance. You're gonna eat to next week is the the face
[54:57.340 --> 55:01.400]  Trial number one first of many by the sounds of it. No, I think we only need one
[55:01.400 --> 55:07.180]  I think we're good one. I mean unless you need more time. I feel very confident in my I'm not talking about for this one case
[55:07.180 --> 55:10.120]  I'm just gonna say you're gonna if you're gonna jab up these bets in future
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.800]  We're gonna have several more. I would never do this. What you're accusing me of is something. I never even consider
[55:19.180 --> 55:22.040]  Also Andrew we need to get a hold on the on the collecting thing
[55:22.040 --> 55:26.060]  I've been just buying cards randomly and I spent about 800 bucks this week on basketball cards
[55:26.060 --> 55:30.060]  What are you I I can't I can't be doing it anymore. We gotta I gotta have a chewing
[55:30.060 --> 55:31.760]  I gotta have a face focus
[55:32.240 --> 55:32.560]  I
[55:38.540 --> 55:44.460]  Been sitting at home going crazy buying packs of fucking panini prison basketball cards, dude. I got to
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.640]  Yeah, well what happened I don't talk to you because of the yeah, I got to I was gonna send one to you maybe
[55:53.300 --> 55:56.020]  There I've seen him go for 150 and I've seen him go for like 600
[55:56.020 --> 55:57.260]  So I was thinking about getting him graded
[55:57.260 --> 56:01.640]  Anyway, you need to help me figure we need to figure out a focus for me to focus this
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.740]  Obsession with cards because otherwise, I'm gonna go broke. I'm gonna go broke real fast
[56:05.740 --> 56:09.740]  I just bought I just bought $600 worth of fucking it's
[56:09.740 --> 56:15.580]  2016 2017 cards trying to chase Jamal Murray rookie cards, and I this is not healthy
[56:15.580 --> 56:21.380]  I need to we I need to I need to focus this and like towards a bussy or like oh my god
[56:21.380 --> 56:23.420]  I see we got bussy. I got bussy
[56:23.980 --> 56:26.220]  Should we talk about our idea before we break?
[56:26.300 --> 56:29.280]  I know Eric wants to go but should we talk about our idea with Gavin for the
[56:30.040 --> 56:35.120]  The cards we wanted to collect like the mini collection we were gonna do and how dark that went real fast
[56:35.500 --> 56:37.380]  Well, I mean, I think we could talk about it
[56:37.380 --> 56:39.380]  We don't necessarily need to touch on the darkness
[56:39.380 --> 56:43.960]  But if you want to go all the way, I mean we could we
[56:44.540 --> 56:48.180]  Andrew and I were talking to today Gavin about you know, we got this guy bussy
[56:48.180 --> 56:52.680]  I think Tom Martin is his name the guy who was traded for a bus traded for a bus
[56:52.680 --> 56:56.240]  I have his I have his rookie card right here in front of me or his only card
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.600]  Yeah, and Angie started looking up other people. There was a guy who was traded for
[57:02.720 --> 57:08.300]  What was it like a box of baseball? Yes, he was traded for a box of used baseballs
[57:08.300 --> 57:13.500]  And I read the story behind it is amazing. The photographer didn't want him to do that
[57:13.500 --> 57:15.860]  Like yeah, I guess he'd taken so many minor league cards
[57:15.860 --> 57:18.900]  He wanted to do something original and the guy was very serious
[57:18.900 --> 57:24.920]  And so the only way he could convince the photographer to take the picture as he had every single other player on his team
[57:24.920 --> 57:29.360]  Agree, they would not sign their rights for the cards to be made unless he took that photo
[57:29.360 --> 57:32.260]  And so then he was like, oh fuck. Okay, we'll do it
[57:32.260 --> 57:35.100]  And so he crazy glued a baseball to his nuts
[57:35.100 --> 57:39.260]  On the pants and was starting to fall off as he was taking the photo
[57:39.260 --> 57:44.900]  So he's just frantically yelling at the guy to take the picture and he was very happy. It's a great card. It's a great card
[57:44.900 --> 57:45.540]  I want that card
[57:45.540 --> 57:50.640]  There was a there was a guy who was traded a basketball guy who was traded for
[57:51.120 --> 57:56.860]  I think he was traded to the Celtics or from the Celtics preseason so that they they wouldn't have to
[57:56.860 --> 58:02.940]  Like the trade was we'll trade you this player if you agree to play two of the preseason games for us
[58:02.940 --> 58:07.920]  So we don't have to play them. Was that what it was? I interpreted as like adding preseason games
[58:07.920 --> 58:13.140]  Oh adding preseason games. I thought it was like I thought it was like we don't want to play these two preseason games
[58:13.140 --> 58:15.760]  So if you got if you'll if you'll agree to play then we'll take this player
[58:15.760 --> 58:22.020]  And then there was the one that was fucking dark was there was a guy who was traded for 10 used bats or 10 baseball
[58:22.020 --> 58:23.100]  bats was it 10?
[58:26.420 --> 58:31.640]  Well, it became tragic that was the dark part that's not the dark part it was he was in the minor leagues and
[58:32.960 --> 58:35.240]  he he got traded for these baseball bats and
[58:36.800 --> 58:40.460]  Unfortunately, I think it was he got traded to a Canadian team, right?
[58:40.960 --> 58:45.360]  But then he had a felony or something and so they wouldn't let him cross
[58:45.760 --> 58:50.500]  they wouldn't let him cross over from the US into Canada, so he couldn't join the team and
[58:51.520 --> 58:53.420]  So then they were kind of stuck
[58:53.420 --> 58:56.440]  So then they tried to like tried to reverse the trade
[58:56.440 --> 58:58.560]  But they didn't want him so then the Canadian team
[58:58.560 --> 59:01.240]  Since they couldn't bring him into Canada to play for them
[59:01.240 --> 59:02.380]  They didn't know what to do
[59:02.380 --> 59:08.820]  So they traded him to another team another team for 10, I think 10 or 20 baseball bats, right? Which is very funny except
[59:09.860 --> 59:15.060]  Then the next game when he went to the new team, they started playing the Batman theme every time he played
[59:15.060 --> 59:18.800]  I think he was a pitcher and it got into his head
[59:18.800 --> 59:23.360]  they started calling him Batman and Batboy and it got into his head and
[59:23.360 --> 59:29.300]  even and the audience started to heckle him every time he would play and even I read the umpires heckled him and
[59:29.700 --> 59:35.340]  He washed out of baseball like two weeks later, and then he got into heavy drugs and died of an overdose. Oh
[59:35.340 --> 59:40.180]  That is way darker than the story. You told me you left the information
[59:40.180 --> 59:43.600]  I got none of that was there you edited a lot
[59:43.600 --> 59:45.160]  So what was your dark version?
[59:45.340 --> 59:46.040]  I did some additional
[59:46.520 --> 59:52.180]  Version was that just the guy played baseball and then he partied one night and things got out of hand and he tragically died
[59:52.180 --> 59:57.340]  I had no concept of any of the other stuff. I cut out the part where he washed out of baseball and stuff
[59:57.340 --> 01:00:01.440]  Yeah, I was still reading about it when I was talking to you about a really sad story. He died on election day
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.860]  I think 2016 2018 2016. Woof. Yeah, woof. That's a wolf. It's sad
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:13.580]  It's like it's it's funny to think of getting traded for some baseballs or a bus
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:19.640]  Or whatever and then you you hear the dark side of what it's like to be traded and how it affects you and it's suddenly
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:26.100]  Not as funny. Yeah, it's cool. Okay, I think he's fine. Okay, do we have more Instagram followers than cool here yet?
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:30.060]  Oh, I don't think we're anywhere close. I think we have a wreath out two or three thousand
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.460]  But that's a good point. You should follow us face pod on Instagram
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:40.440]  I think I think we we put up our faces the faces you and I drew I think today
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.440]  We're putting up Andrews face the one that he drew not that anybody gives you original
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.500]  It can't be the original face if it's the third one presented it is the original face you're
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.200]  Yeah, because I had the original face and why did you draw your face if my face no
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:06.080]  It may have been slightly more impressive if you pulled out an actual original from like back in the day when when you learned about it
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.240]  But just draw it a new one. That wasn't original. I don't have anything from back then
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.660]  I don't I couldn't do that, but you wouldn't have your face if it wasn't for my face
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.440]  So I have the original face, you know what I was I was thinking
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.900]  This is kind of is it the face and face? Is this the official face?
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.660]  Andrews drawing that's actually an interesting question. We don't have to answer it right now, but it's something to think about
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.540]  I'd love to hear what the audience thinks too. It might be
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:39.300]  We should make a maybe we should make a Andrew face shirt put it on like a like a pocket to you or something
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.440]  I think Eric is on his third copy and paste for the end of the podcast. Oh, right, right, right
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:51.040]  Yeah, well, I guess he's the announcer not the ender so I'll do it. Hey, this has been another episode of face
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.700]  I believe it was episode 16, but I can never keep that straight. Thank you for listening

[01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:53.230]  It's up to Eric.
