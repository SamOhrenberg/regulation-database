[00:28.120 --> 00:49.870]  Hello, and welcome to episode 17 of F*** Face, a very special episode. If you've been listening
[00:49.870 --> 00:55.730]  to the past ones, you'd be aware that today is a trial. We're having a trial over a burger dispute.
[00:56.750 --> 01:01.630]  Now Gavin, myself, and Geoff had a deal, or a bet, I should say, that I could eat
[01:02.630 --> 01:09.010]  25 doubles in 10 hours or less. And if I couldn't, I'd pay Gavin $100. Now Gavin,
[01:09.010 --> 01:15.270]  out of nowhere after I lost this bet, claimed that I also said I would eat a pencil. This has
[01:15.270 --> 01:19.470]  been very disputed. You will find no evidence anywhere of me ever saying this. This is a
[01:19.470 --> 01:24.310]  completely manufactured lie by Geoff and Gavin. And quite frankly, I'm sad that they went this way.
[01:24.590 --> 01:27.970]  Like, it's upsetting to me. We've had a long friendship for a long time,
[01:28.130 --> 01:33.290]  and for them to try to force me to eat a pencil like this has been difficult. It's been some
[01:33.290 --> 01:38.350]  soul-searching. I wouldn't say there's any love lost between the three of us, but, you know,
[01:38.350 --> 01:43.330]  I've had to find it a little bit. Had to go searching. Typically, by now you would have
[01:43.330 --> 01:49.110]  heard Geoff and Gavin, considering this is our court date, but 90 minutes before we were supposed
[01:49.110 --> 01:56.690]  to do this, out of nowhere, no warning, very mysteriously, I may add, Geoff puts out an email
[01:56.690 --> 02:02.930]  saying that he was not going to be available due to a dental issue? A tooth problem? I don't even
[02:02.930 --> 02:09.170]  think he specified what was happening, but that he couldn't be here and that they'd need to change
[02:09.170 --> 02:15.930]  the recording tomorrow. You can't just change a court date 90 minutes before it happens with no
[02:15.930 --> 02:20.790]  real excuse. I'm calling complete bullshit on this. I think they know their case is weak.
[02:21.070 --> 02:26.450]  I think they know they're lacking the evidence to force this pencil upon myself and that they
[02:26.450 --> 02:31.850]  panicked and they needed extra time. But you can't do that. I reject that. You cannot move a court
[02:31.850 --> 02:38.730]  date 90 minutes before it happened. So we are here today. We are at court. Geoff and Gavin, feel free
[02:38.730 --> 02:43.370]  to make your opening statements. I'll give you the entire floor. Say whatever you want to say about
[02:43.370 --> 02:49.490]  this case. Oh, that's right. They're not here. They didn't show up because they know that they're in
[02:49.490 --> 02:55.350]  the wrong and they just they're too cowardice to address. But that doesn't stop me from being here
[02:55.350 --> 03:00.370]  because I'm an innocent man. I want to clear my name. I am a man of honor. I am a man of integrity.
[03:00.370 --> 03:05.630]  And that's what we're going to do today. So I have a few clips. I had this whole thing planned last
[03:05.630 --> 03:11.110]  week. I presented a document that went over my case from my legal team, very established group
[03:11.110 --> 03:16.390]  of lawyers. And I don't even think I need to go that way. We've already filed it. I'm an innocent
[03:16.390 --> 03:22.830]  guy, so I don't need to work too hard to defend this. I just brought a few clips mainly to show
[03:22.830 --> 03:27.990]  my character and to display the character in which we're dealing with in this case. Now, normally two
[03:27.990 --> 03:35.830]  great guys, but there's been some conflict. Geoff has been blinded by Garfield jealousy and I've got
[03:35.830 --> 03:41.190]  the tapes to prove it. So we're going to open here. This is first just a a kind of general
[03:42.090 --> 03:47.250]  character examination of what we're dealing with. This is not at all doctored. And anyway, this is a
[03:47.250 --> 03:52.590]  very authentic audio clip of the two people that are making these charges against me. So here we go.
[03:52.590 --> 04:00.110]  Here's the clip. Clip one. Exhibit A, you may say. Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, and we can't trust
[04:00.110 --> 04:06.510]  it. Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free admitting their lies. How are you going to trust that? You can't. They're
[04:06.510 --> 04:10.650]  liars. Anything they present, anything they would have brought today would have been a lie. It's
[04:10.650 --> 04:15.250]  looping again because I don't do this often. That's the first exhibit. Now, the second exhibit
[04:15.250 --> 04:21.450]  to further show how good of a guy I am in my character. In contrast to them, I have a very
[04:21.450 --> 04:28.030]  interesting clip of them talking about how sweet I am. So here's exhibit B. Andrew will drop
[04:28.030 --> 04:32.530]  whatever he's doing to help me. I love him so much. He's like it's like I care about him. He's
[04:32.530 --> 04:36.910]  the sweetest, nicest human. And he's so patient with me like he was. I had to platform through
[04:36.910 --> 04:40.610]  that bit in Crota so he could. He's like my everything. He was like, yeah, up there. And
[04:40.610 --> 04:43.650]  he was like shooting where I should jump. And I was like, you should be a good you should be a
[04:43.650 --> 04:50.950]  teacher. He's like my other daughter. He's like my other daughter. High praise from Geoff Ramsey.
[04:51.610 --> 04:57.110]  It's I mean, it just if anything, it makes it sadder to know that he succumbed to the perils
[04:57.110 --> 05:03.790]  of lasagna, that he did not want to climb Lasagna Mountain as a man, but instead tried to take me
[05:03.790 --> 05:08.430]  out via pencil with this whole made up story. I have a mountain of evidence that I mean,
[05:08.450 --> 05:15.190]  you you can't deny those last two clips. But just as a cherry on top, this is Geoff Ramsey's
[05:15.190 --> 05:22.490]  daughter, sadly, disappointedly admitting that not only am I a man of honor, that I am a
[05:22.490 --> 05:29.410]  trustworthy individual, that Geoff Ramsey succumbed to Garfield jealousy. He could not beat the pizza
[05:29.410 --> 05:37.350]  cup. The pizza cup turned this man against his most important ideals. Here's Millie Ramsey.
[05:37.570 --> 05:42.570]  Hello, my name is Millie Ramsey and I am a character witness for Andrew Panton. I am here
[05:42.570 --> 05:47.710]  today to ensure that the court knows that Andrew is not only honorable, but extremely trustworthy.
[05:48.810 --> 05:54.110]  On top of this, I must share that my dad, in fact, manufactured the audio of the pencil
[05:54.110 --> 06:00.090]  bed agreement. After hundreds of failed attempts to beat the pizza cup, he was blinded by jealousy
[06:00.090 --> 06:05.210]  that he could not achieve the same level of Garfield success. I mean, think about it.
[06:05.910 --> 06:12.410]  One of the heads of Rooster Teeth, he must hold some kind of power to be able to do this.
[06:12.930 --> 06:18.690]  I hate having to reveal my dad would do such a thing, but it's true. Andrew Panton is completely
[06:18.690 --> 06:23.570]  innocent and I am personally saddened knowing that my father has made such poor and petty
[06:23.570 --> 06:30.190]  decisions. But I hope he will grow after this court and become truly unclear after this all.
[06:30.450 --> 06:35.830]  So thank you so much for listening to this. I couldn't have said it better. I feel that this
[06:35.830 --> 06:41.690]  whole process at this stage is unclear. I thank you for your time. I thank you to the courts
[06:41.690 --> 06:47.330]  for for listening to this and to have to take time out of your day to deal with such a nonsense
[06:47.330 --> 06:56.410]  allegation by the other side. I appreciate your time. Have a wonderful day. Hello and welcome
[06:56.410 --> 07:05.230]  to another episode of not another continuation of Geoff. Just so you know, this is part two of
[07:05.230 --> 07:13.050]  episode 17. Did you just say episode? Episode. Doesn't matter. Episode. What do you mean it's
[07:13.050 --> 07:18.110]  a continuation? You interrupted a perfectly good intro there. No, no, no, no, no, no. We don't need
[07:18.110 --> 07:22.970]  an intro. I already did the intro. We don't need an intro. Don't worry about it. I'm not doing the
[07:22.970 --> 07:27.270]  intro. I'm not. I'm not doing the intro fight this week. I don't care what episode. No, no, no, no,
[07:27.350 --> 07:33.170]  no. I don't care if it's a fight. I don't care. I don't. I don't care if it's a continuation or not.
[07:33.170 --> 07:38.490]  It's still face. It's still episode, whatever the fuck it is. It's Andrew 17. I think it's like
[07:38.490 --> 07:44.210]  an 8% chance. You're correct. Nobody knows what episode it is. I named it episode 15 on the file.
[07:44.610 --> 07:48.870]  I know what episode it is because I've already recorded part of this episode. Wait, there was
[07:48.870 --> 07:54.510]  an intro already recorded prior to this. We already did this. I already did this. You guys don't need
[07:54.510 --> 07:59.150]  to worry about a thing. Where was I? Well, yeah, here's the thing. Where were you two is the great
[07:59.150 --> 08:04.130]  question. Well, how about this? I'm going to do an intro that will be edited in before yours.
[08:04.390 --> 08:08.110]  No, it can't be. It makes no sense. Wait a minute. Can I get to the bottom of this? Are you
[08:08.110 --> 08:12.970]  bitching right now because we didn't record yesterday when we were supposed to? Not at all
[08:12.970 --> 08:17.730]  bitching. I'm just stating the fact of what happened. Listen, let me explain what happened.
[08:18.450 --> 08:26.130]  We had we agreed last week. Our big case was going to be next week. We record on Thursday.
[08:26.130 --> 08:34.590]  Next episode going to be on a Thursday. We all agreed important trial 90 minutes before the trial
[08:34.590 --> 08:41.270]  was supposed to begin. I get an email saying Geoff's out, can't do it. Mysterious tooth injury
[08:41.270 --> 08:47.730]  suddenly appears. No warning. Very suspicious. And I reject that. I reject that you should be
[08:47.730 --> 08:53.950]  able to move a case 90 minutes before it happened. So what did I do? I went to the courts on time.
[08:53.950 --> 09:00.150]  I showed up for the court date and I won my goddamn trial because you two didn't show up.
[09:00.350 --> 09:05.750]  I won by default. Geoff was the second person who failed to make it yesterday. Eric was already
[09:05.750 --> 09:11.090]  out. He's the judge. Eric already couldn't do it. No, no. I went to the case. Nick can agree. Nick
[09:11.090 --> 09:17.230]  was a witness. I pled my case. It was recorded for judging. I gave you guys the floor. I gave
[09:17.230 --> 09:21.850]  you guys an outrageous amount of time to speak. No words coming from the other side. Makes no
[09:21.850 --> 09:27.110]  sense that you would do court without us. No, I went to the date. I showed up on time. It's not
[09:27.110 --> 09:31.250]  my fault you weren't there. There's nothing mysterious about it, first of all. It was
[09:31.250 --> 09:38.370]  very mysterious. Not to be at ends with my two best friends here, or one of the two idiots that
[09:38.370 --> 09:47.070]  I call best friends, but Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton. F***face. Already did it. You don't
[09:47.870 --> 09:57.050]  already was out. It wasn't just like mysterious circumstances. There are extenuating circumstances
[09:57.050 --> 10:02.030]  which I would love to get into if I can, if I may, but you said you wanted to do the court case
[10:02.030 --> 10:05.490]  first. Yeah, because the court case already happened. I was just letting you guys know that I
[10:05.490 --> 10:11.350]  won. I see. Okay. Well, your practice court case... No, the real case is done. I showed up on time.
[10:11.430 --> 10:15.490]  You can't change a court case 90 minutes before it's supposed to happen. Andrew, I know we're
[10:15.490 --> 10:19.250]  backing you into a corner. You're freaking out. You're getting all uppity. I gotta say,
[10:19.430 --> 10:26.550]  in addition, the world has been tweeting me clips from that other podcast where you incriminate
[10:26.550 --> 10:30.990]  yourself by agreeing to the pencil. You've been replying to some I've seen. You've been all over
[10:30.990 --> 10:38.990]  the Twitter. I'm so f***ing dizzy right now. Geoff, what are you on? Codeine? Yeah, yeah. Here's why.
[10:38.990 --> 10:47.570]  You guys know I had a root canal a few weeks ago, right? Yeah. Well, I f***ed up. I f***ed
[10:47.570 --> 10:56.010]  face myself and I scheduled... I f***ed face myself and face f***ed myself. Only one of those should
[10:56.010 --> 11:01.370]  have to be bleeped because I scheduled a dentist appointment on the day of the recording of a f***
[11:01.370 --> 11:06.150]  face and it turned out to be a root canal, right? So I was all loopy and out of my mind and in pain
[11:06.570 --> 11:11.330]  when we did that recording. Well, I scheduled the follow-up to finish the root canal
[11:12.130 --> 11:17.650]  Wednesday, the day before the podcast. Big brain Geoff did that one. Shouldn't be an issue, right?
[11:18.630 --> 11:22.910]  That was a burp. Right. But here's what happened. I went to my dentist. They said,
[11:23.170 --> 11:25.990]  let me just tell you the whole story. I go to my dentist. I got a toothache. They go,
[11:26.090 --> 11:30.330]  you need a root canal. We're going to do 80% of the root canal today. And then when you come
[11:30.330 --> 11:33.510]  back in to get a new crown put on, because we're going to need to put a permanent crown on your
[11:33.510 --> 11:38.090]  tooth, then we'll finish the root canal and put the crown on, kick you out the door, happy as can
[11:38.090 --> 11:47.330]  be. That was supposed to be Wednesday. Wednesday I go in, they spent two hours in my mouth and said,
[11:48.750 --> 11:55.350]  well, this is a bigger job than we're capable of handling. You've got, it's a big root canal.
[11:55.870 --> 12:00.030]  It's a little bit more than a typical dentist can do. We don't have the right equipment. We
[12:00.030 --> 12:04.790]  could do it. They're skilled. They're trained technicians. The doctors seemed very capable,
[12:04.970 --> 12:09.690]  but they didn't have the right equipment to do it. So they sent me to an endodontist,
[12:09.730 --> 12:14.170]  I believe is what they're called, which is apparently a dentist who just does root canals.
[12:14.250 --> 12:20.010]  It's like the root canal store. And so I was in a tremendous amount of pain and they were like,
[12:20.070 --> 12:25.310]  you better get in to see this endodontist as soon as possible. So the only day the endodontist works
[12:25.310 --> 12:33.150]  is Thursdays. So I left Wednesday in incredible pain and Thursday morning got up and went to the
[12:33.150 --> 12:39.990]  goddamn endodontist and had another root canal. On the same canal. Same canal. So round three
[12:39.990 --> 12:44.630]  on the same tooth that started at 11 a.m. on Wednesday. I wasn't done till four.
[12:47.590 --> 12:51.890]  And this was after two hours the day before? The day before. The day before, yeah.
[12:52.610 --> 12:58.590]  Here's how that ended. By the way, great guy. And then everybody, the dental assistant,
[12:58.690 --> 13:03.370]  everybody was lovely. It was actually, being there in the moment was painless. They did a
[13:03.370 --> 13:08.150]  really good job of numbing me. Just fantastic bedside manner. If you're in the Austin area
[13:08.150 --> 13:14.150]  and you need some recommendations on endodontists, I'll hook you up, hit me up offline. That's for
[13:14.150 --> 13:19.610]  the audience as well, not just you two idiots. But the end result is, that was round three.
[13:19.610 --> 13:27.370]  I am scheduled for round four. Oh no! In two weeks. And then after round four,
[13:27.530 --> 13:32.510]  there will be a round five. Are they like, putting bolts in your gum?
[13:32.610 --> 13:39.110]  No, it's none of that. It's just that like, they have to like, without getting too in the weeds
[13:39.110 --> 13:44.590]  with it, like the dentist was able to get two of the three nerves and then the part of the process
[13:44.590 --> 13:48.970]  of them making it weight is they have to put medicine in to sanitize it. And then you need
[13:48.970 --> 13:53.750]  take a round of antibiotics and steroids and shit. And so when I couldn't do that for the
[13:53.750 --> 13:58.790]  third tooth, I then got kind of reset. And so the endodontist had to go in,
[13:59.770 --> 14:04.730]  fix that third nerve, and then I have to do a round of steroids and a round of treatment and
[14:04.730 --> 14:09.210]  a round of antibiotics all over again. So I have to wait two more weeks before he can then go in
[14:09.210 --> 14:16.230]  and finish it. But he doesn't put crowns on. He only patches holes in root canals. So after that's
[14:16.230 --> 14:21.890]  done, then I have to go back to my dentist to do the crown, whereas the fifth trip is involved.
[14:22.090 --> 14:29.030]  So by the time it's all said and done, this goddamn root canal will be minimum five visits
[14:29.030 --> 14:34.790]  with people in my tooth, people up in my mouth, minimum of five. We're talking about like 11 hours
[14:34.790 --> 14:40.390]  under the knife or the drill, maybe they say in dentistry. I don't know. And it's going to span
[14:40.390 --> 14:46.890]  over two months. I will have been with a temporary mouth, not being able to use the left side of my
[14:46.890 --> 14:53.810]  mouth for two, maybe three months. And I would be lying if I said it's a struggle not to cry
[14:53.810 --> 14:59.050]  out of frustration and pain and sadness every moment I'm awake right now. I hope you feel guilty,
[14:59.250 --> 15:04.570]  Andrew, that after hearing that story, all of the hours, five different trips, that you went to court
[15:05.170 --> 15:08.910]  without him and are now blaming him for not being there. How do you feel about that?
[15:08.910 --> 15:13.270]  I'm not blaming him at all. I feel absolutely great. I think the thing I took away from that
[15:13.270 --> 15:19.570]  story is he learned on Wednesday he had to go on Thursday. Why did we not get notice of this?
[15:19.670 --> 15:24.030]  He went in at 11 by the sounds of it. They told me it wouldn't take more than an hour,
[15:24.110 --> 15:30.810]  hour and a half. I thought I would be done. And I was in the slack and I said, hey, guys,
[15:30.830 --> 15:34.810]  this could be a game time decision. It's taken longer than I thought. Just letting you know,
[15:34.810 --> 15:39.070]  I thought I was going to be able to get it, come in mouth all numbed up on Novocain,
[15:39.230 --> 15:45.690]  full of drugs and be like, oh, and be funny and loopy because I thought it would be I thought
[15:45.690 --> 15:50.150]  my misery, my pain would be y'all's pleasure. Instead, it was just a lot more of my pain.
[15:50.610 --> 15:54.250]  Also, Andrew, we knew that the judge was absent from this court case.
[15:54.270 --> 15:55.430]  Eric's not the judge.
[15:55.910 --> 16:02.750]  And yes, he is. And even in the slack, we've been talking to you for like six weeks in our
[16:02.750 --> 16:08.030]  personal slack, where it's just it's just all of the face crew. And you weren't even in there.
[16:08.030 --> 16:11.650]  You were just not my fault. No, that's not my fault. I wasn't ignoring it.
[16:11.730 --> 16:15.250]  I know I disagree. I disagree that it is not your fault.
[16:15.390 --> 16:17.650]  How is this not my fault? Elaborate.
[16:17.850 --> 16:25.210]  This is absolutely your fault. So when I when I add Andrew Panton onto our slack group and
[16:25.210 --> 16:30.130]  Andrew Panton does not get the messages, how is that anyone's fault but yours?
[16:30.130 --> 16:33.170]  This is OK. Well, here's something that's crazy.
[16:33.850 --> 16:38.290]  First of all, that I never replied to any of them when I'm replying in other slacks.
[16:38.430 --> 16:41.390]  Like you guys, I talk to you in different slack chats.
[16:41.590 --> 16:45.310]  And I just thought you didn't give a shit. Like I'm giving I'm not giving notes on episodes.
[16:45.390 --> 16:48.590]  We're like doing suggestions. We're like sending files that we talked about so we
[16:48.590 --> 16:51.810]  can put them in the picture version on our website. Silence.
[16:52.070 --> 16:53.850]  And I just thought, man, Andrew, don't give a shit.
[16:54.030 --> 16:55.130]  He's a real prick that Andrew.
[16:55.130 --> 17:00.330]  And on top of that, Eric said he sent me multiple messages and I never replied.
[17:00.430 --> 17:02.130]  And he's like, oh, I guess he's just not a slack guy.
[17:02.310 --> 17:05.770]  I've talked to Eric about the fact that I could message him on slack.
[17:06.070 --> 17:09.970]  And he didn't consider that weird that I never acknowledged that any chats had
[17:09.970 --> 17:13.210]  previously happened apparently. I absolutely thought it was weird.
[17:13.390 --> 17:16.210]  But you're also the guy who's going, well, I'll eat the pencil.
[17:16.370 --> 17:20.310]  No, I'm not going to eat the pencil. So I never said I need a terrible example.
[17:20.930 --> 17:23.550]  Also, I never and no offense to Nick. I love Nick.
[17:23.550 --> 17:25.990]  I think Nick's great. And I think he would have done a great job as a judge.
[17:26.110 --> 17:27.870]  But I didn't approve it. And neither did Gavin.
[17:28.210 --> 17:32.550]  And Eric threw it out there. Eric threw it out there as an Eric isn't the judge.
[17:32.830 --> 17:34.370]  Well, then who's the judge? I know more about this case.
[17:34.630 --> 17:37.930]  That's for Eric to reveal. I'll let Eric make that decision when he's right.
[17:38.110 --> 17:41.190]  You don't get to make there doesn't get to be a secret judge.
[17:41.210 --> 17:42.790]  That's not how court cases work.
[17:42.990 --> 17:46.790]  You don't go up to the Supreme Court to present who the judge is either.
[17:46.970 --> 17:50.070]  You don't fucking miss your trial 90 minutes before it happens.
[17:50.210 --> 17:52.210]  You do when it's a medical emergency.
[17:52.210 --> 17:53.530]  I can't yell.
[17:57.770 --> 18:00.870]  It wasn't a sudden emergency, though. You knew a day in advance.
[18:00.950 --> 18:04.650]  You're saying you've already done the intro. You've already done court.
[18:04.650 --> 18:08.770]  Yeah, this podcast is almost at 20 minutes, actually, even though we've been recording for 11.
[18:09.250 --> 18:09.750]  It was a good case.
[18:09.810 --> 18:12.090]  You're saying that Eric isn't the judge anymore.
[18:12.530 --> 18:14.790]  Oh, no. I mean, I don't know who the judge is,
[18:14.910 --> 18:17.930]  but Eric isn't the judge from my understanding. Eric's not the judge.
[18:18.370 --> 18:20.830]  That's what I was told. I'm just relaying what I was told.
[18:20.830 --> 18:22.650]  He vetoed Geoff as the judge.
[18:22.870 --> 18:25.950]  Well, he couldn't be a judge. He's definitely not impartial.
[18:26.490 --> 18:31.050]  I gotta say, I just feel great also that this weight of having to eat the pencil is off me.
[18:31.210 --> 18:36.410]  It's a nice stress relief knowing I have won this case and we can put this behind us.
[18:36.550 --> 18:37.670]  You are a true villain.
[18:38.290 --> 18:39.910]  Not at all. I showed up on time.
[18:40.110 --> 18:43.410]  You are gaslighting on Trumpian levels, my friend.
[18:43.530 --> 18:45.010]  Not at all. I showed up on time.
[18:45.210 --> 18:48.650]  I was excited for court today. It's the end of the day. I've been waiting all day for court.
[18:48.650 --> 18:49.470]  I was excited for court, too.
[18:49.470 --> 18:51.090]  You did cool without me.
[18:51.550 --> 18:52.530]  Bullshit, pull us.
[18:52.870 --> 18:53.350]  Well, yeah, what?
[18:53.830 --> 18:54.970]  Why don't we just have our own court?
[18:55.390 --> 18:56.250]  Why does he get to decide?
[18:56.530 --> 18:57.030]  He's not the boss.
[18:57.590 --> 18:59.410]  Twice for two crimes? For one crime?
[19:00.270 --> 19:01.470]  You can't double charge me.
[19:01.670 --> 19:02.070]  I'm already cleared.
[19:02.070 --> 19:03.950]  You haven't been charged yet. You can't be clear.
[19:04.070 --> 19:06.510]  We went to- what do you mean I wasn't- I was at court yesterday.
[19:06.610 --> 19:10.550]  You can't be clear if you don't even know who the judge was that cleared you, you idiot.
[19:10.910 --> 19:11.330]  No, it's-
[19:11.330 --> 19:11.850]  Think about it.
[19:11.850 --> 19:12.990]  No, no, I-
[19:12.990 --> 19:16.390]  It's not like the Supreme Court. It's like a blind box. You don't know who you're gonna pull.
[19:17.690 --> 19:18.710]  I made a deal.
[19:18.710 --> 19:21.350]  Eric told me that there's a judge in the works.
[19:21.570 --> 19:24.870]  I was so confident about my case, I didn't need to know who the judge was.
[19:25.130 --> 19:28.050]  Well, then how have you already done court if there's a judge in the works?
[19:28.250 --> 19:32.750]  Well, because from my understanding, and I guess I'm gonna have to fucking explain the whole bit,
[19:32.930 --> 19:36.830]  Eric was gonna take the audio from my defense and your argument,
[19:37.190 --> 19:39.630]  and then present it to the person who would be the judge,
[19:39.770 --> 19:43.090]  and then they would make the ruling, and then that would be relayed to us.
[19:43.750 --> 19:45.510]  That was my understanding of the process.
[19:45.730 --> 19:46.450]  That sounds great.
[19:46.450 --> 19:50.050]  How do you boot someone from the discord just so we can do court without Andrew?
[19:50.450 --> 19:50.510]  Eric.
[19:50.530 --> 19:53.030]  You can't. For what? What am I being accused of?
[19:53.350 --> 19:53.610]  Eric.
[19:53.850 --> 19:54.470]  Yes, I'm here.
[19:54.870 --> 20:00.010]  What is your assertion of this? Is this case over? Has Andrew already won?
[20:00.010 --> 20:02.530]  Oh, no, no, no, no. The case isn't over at all.
[20:02.950 --> 20:06.110]  The case is absolutely over. I went to court. I showed up on time.
[20:06.270 --> 20:08.270]  Has the mystery judge ruled?
[20:08.830 --> 20:12.650]  No, no, he has not, because I have not received Andrew's defense,
[20:12.910 --> 20:14.570]  and I have not received your defense.
[20:14.570 --> 20:21.630]  Well, they missed their window to receive the defense. They can't submit any defense.
[20:21.970 --> 20:25.190]  I had a hell of a defense, by the way. I had character witnesses.
[20:25.710 --> 20:28.770]  I didn't even need to go with the legal thing, because as an innocent man,
[20:28.930 --> 20:31.990]  I didn't need much evidence. I just let the truth come out.
[20:32.350 --> 20:36.890]  Every single step of this court case has been tampered with and
[20:36.890 --> 20:41.130]  twisted around by the defendant, and I'm not having it.
[20:41.370 --> 20:43.010]  I don't think it twisted at all.
[20:43.010 --> 20:46.210]  I got audio. I can play audio if you want.
[20:46.510 --> 20:47.010]  Play some audio.
[20:47.310 --> 20:51.870]  You're making William Barr look like a humanitarian right now. You know that, right?
[20:52.130 --> 20:55.590]  I'm just... I showed up to court on time. I don't know how I'm the villain here.
[20:55.790 --> 20:56.790]  I'm the only one that showed up.
[20:56.790 --> 21:00.130]  Court wasn't in session. You may have shown up to the cupboards next to court.
[21:00.230 --> 21:02.590]  We all agreed. We all agreed.
[21:02.930 --> 21:06.910]  And we all agreed beforehand in the agreed-upon slack that it wasn't happening.
[21:07.150 --> 21:08.350]  Well, I wasn't in that slack.
[21:08.610 --> 21:10.670]  That's not our fault! We weren't in court!
[21:10.670 --> 21:13.470]  You weren't in the slack, and we weren't in court!
[21:14.050 --> 21:16.890]  We never... hang on. Now, we never...
[21:16.890 --> 21:22.010]  Now, we never explained why I added Andrew to the Slack channel,
[21:22.150 --> 21:24.530]  but he didn't receive the slacks. Why is that, Andrew?
[21:24.870 --> 21:26.370]  Oh, well, okay. So this is...
[21:26.370 --> 21:30.470]  Why I have two Slack accounts is when I went to add Slack on my phone,
[21:30.890 --> 21:34.430]  I couldn't remember if I used my work email or my personal email.
[21:34.670 --> 21:37.690]  And the guess I made in the car was not the right guess.
[21:37.690 --> 21:41.190]  So I accidentally just made a second account and then panicked,
[21:41.330 --> 21:42.890]  signed out of it, and never thought of it again.
[21:43.190 --> 21:44.550]  So that's why I have two accounts.
[21:45.230 --> 21:48.510]  My main account has limited access privileges.
[21:48.910 --> 21:52.690]  I'm only allowed within the Achievement Hunter part of Slack.
[21:52.910 --> 21:56.350]  My fake account? Complete access to everything.
[21:56.590 --> 21:59.990]  It has more privileges than what my actual account has,
[22:00.110 --> 22:04.370]  and I have several messages I signed in after this reveal
[22:04.370 --> 22:08.130]  that I was in a f*** face Discord or chat Slack that I didn't know about.
[22:08.690 --> 22:11.670]  I signed in, and I've got a lot of messages.
[22:12.110 --> 22:16.050]  I have like seven or eight, and some of them may be related to hats,
[22:16.150 --> 22:21.330]  and may be related to the store, which makes it funny that I've been so aggressive without realizing.
[22:21.850 --> 22:25.110]  You've been shitting on the store this whole time, but you've actually been ignoring them.
[22:25.390 --> 22:30.650]  Yeah, I may have actually have appeared to have ghosted someone who was trying to get a hat
[22:30.650 --> 22:32.250]  to make the hat.
[22:32.690 --> 22:33.790]  We could go back to that in a minute.
[22:33.790 --> 22:36.050]  I just have some very important audio to play.
[22:36.150 --> 22:38.630]  This is a key character witness for me.
[22:38.950 --> 22:41.110]  I think really summarizes the case really well.
[22:41.190 --> 22:45.310]  Hello, my name is Millie Ramsey, and I am a character witness for Andrew Panton.
[22:45.770 --> 22:48.150]  Thank you so much for listening to this.
[22:48.570 --> 22:50.770]  First off, let me say three things.
[22:51.170 --> 22:53.670]  One, there's no proof that that's actually Millie Ramsey, my daughter.
[22:55.250 --> 22:57.610]  Two, I've never taken a DNA test.
[22:57.750 --> 22:59.070]  I don't know that she's my daughter.
[22:59.210 --> 23:00.370]  I've always just assumed.
[23:01.010 --> 23:01.250]  Wow.
[23:02.750 --> 23:08.190]  I gotta say, I did not expect that Geoff's plan would be disown daughter in response to...
[23:08.190 --> 23:09.670]  Three, and two, Millie.
[23:10.210 --> 23:16.190]  And four, I have my own character witness that trumps my lovely, beautiful daughter,
[23:16.650 --> 23:22.410]  who I think the world of, and who just pissed away her birthday next week, which I think is strange.
[23:23.370 --> 23:27.090]  It is going to be a cold, sad 15 for Millie, unfortunately.
[23:27.810 --> 23:28.590]  I gotta...
[23:28.590 --> 23:29.610]  We gotta wrap this up early.
[23:29.610 --> 23:31.750]  I got a lot of shit to send back to Amazon tonight.
[23:33.270 --> 23:36.210]  I got a lot of packages to unwrap.
[23:36.570 --> 23:37.950]  You got some audio for that, Geoff?
[23:38.170 --> 23:38.790]  I gotta...
[23:38.790 --> 23:42.350]  But, you know, if we're gonna throw character witnesses, this is what I would call,
[23:42.890 --> 23:46.630]  and I think we would all agree, this is what they consider a smoking gun.
[23:47.010 --> 23:48.150]  So I'm gonna play it right now.
[23:48.410 --> 23:49.650]  Hi, this is Andrew Panton.
[23:49.890 --> 23:50.890]  I've promised something.
[23:51.230 --> 23:54.450]  I distinctly remember selling me a box of pencils.
[23:54.690 --> 23:55.630]  I want that on record.
[23:55.830 --> 23:57.350]  This is an actual accurate fact.
[23:57.510 --> 23:58.250]  We don't need a lawyer.
[23:58.250 --> 24:00.930]  Everything has been above bar board.
[24:01.110 --> 24:05.710]  Andrew, that is you, in your words, clearly identifying yourself as Andrew Panton,
[24:06.090 --> 24:09.010]  and then agreeing to eat not only a pencil, but a box of pencils.
[24:09.030 --> 24:10.330]  A whole box, Andrew.
[24:10.910 --> 24:14.030]  That is clearly a manipulated audio file.
[24:14.230 --> 24:14.590]  I don't know.
[24:15.090 --> 24:15.970]  I mean, this is clear.
[24:16.030 --> 24:17.010]  I don't even need to defend that.
[24:17.070 --> 24:18.190]  That was terrible editing.
[24:18.710 --> 24:19.990]  It was very choppily put together.
[24:20.290 --> 24:23.510]  Yeah, well, it's about as good as hearing my daughter read a script you wrote for her.
[24:23.510 --> 24:23.850]  How about that?
[24:23.870 --> 24:25.430]  I didn't write anything.
[24:25.610 --> 24:27.590]  That's a false, harsh accusation.
[24:27.590 --> 24:29.050]  I mean, it's up.
[24:29.130 --> 24:32.970]  It's not for me to determine the veracity of this audio.
[24:33.150 --> 24:37.630]  I will say that it was discovered and it was we went through it.
[24:37.810 --> 24:39.310]  It seems legitimate to me.
[24:39.430 --> 24:42.490]  That's definitely your name and your voice and you agreeing to do it.
[24:42.650 --> 24:47.050]  And it's really at this point up to the judge to decide if it was real or not.
[24:47.210 --> 24:51.350]  We sent it to an expert who examined it for splicing, and he found no evidence.
[24:51.490 --> 24:52.110]  You know, it's funny.
[24:52.210 --> 24:55.610]  It's funny that you bring that up, too, because I also have some audio I'd like to share.
[24:55.610 --> 24:58.370]  Just kind of like I made a character witness for myself
[24:58.930 --> 25:02.490]  and I just wanted to display to the court what I was up against.
[25:02.630 --> 25:04.110]  So so here's my audio clip.
[25:09.210 --> 25:10.930]  Once again, I have audio myself.
[25:11.430 --> 25:13.030]  One of us is better at editing than the other.
[25:13.730 --> 25:15.090]  One of us didn't do the editing.
[25:16.930 --> 25:18.750]  Sounds like it was edited on a microwave.
[25:19.790 --> 25:21.330]  I think that's my phone, actually.
[25:21.330 --> 25:24.550]  I wouldn't blame the the person that edited that.
[25:24.770 --> 25:25.830]  Did a wonderful job.
[25:26.130 --> 25:27.170]  Appreciate their contribution.
[25:27.450 --> 25:28.110]  Can you play that again?
[25:28.370 --> 25:28.970]  Geoff Ramsey.
[25:29.090 --> 25:30.150]  A gap in free.
[25:30.610 --> 25:32.450]  And we both lie as you trust.
[25:32.970 --> 25:34.010]  See, I pulled.
[25:35.390 --> 25:36.750]  Not as listen.
[25:36.950 --> 25:39.390]  You have no fucking idea how hard it is.
[25:39.570 --> 25:39.950]  I do.
[25:40.150 --> 25:42.810]  To find a clip of Gavin saying liar.
[25:43.250 --> 25:44.930]  It is infuriating.
[25:45.570 --> 25:48.910]  Do you know how hard it is to find Andrew Panton saying the name Andrew Panton?
[25:49.270 --> 25:50.630]  Because it never does.
[25:51.410 --> 25:53.370]  Well, yeah, the intro is stupid.
[25:53.370 --> 25:54.550]  Doesn't need to exist.
[25:54.630 --> 25:56.070]  It's a useless thing.
[25:56.350 --> 25:57.050]  Hey, real fast.
[25:57.090 --> 25:57.550]  Real fast.
[25:57.690 --> 25:58.510]  Would you do me a favor, Andrew?
[25:58.710 --> 25:59.130]  Yeah, go ahead.
[25:59.510 --> 26:02.370]  Would you say Andrew Panton?
[26:02.890 --> 26:03.670]  Andrew Panton.
[26:04.110 --> 26:04.430]  Excellent.
[26:04.550 --> 26:04.910]  Thank you.
[26:05.650 --> 26:06.930]  That's good for the future.
[26:07.190 --> 26:11.190]  Can you can you quickly say absolute bag of filth?
[26:11.930 --> 26:13.370]  Absolute bag of filth.
[26:14.230 --> 26:18.350]  Can you say can you say real fast is a what?
[26:19.650 --> 26:21.090]  Would you say is a?
[26:21.770 --> 26:21.930]  Oh, OK.
[26:22.410 --> 26:23.210]  Is a.
[26:23.690 --> 26:24.170]  OK, cool.
[26:24.730 --> 26:25.450]  This will be an easy one.
[26:25.450 --> 26:26.390]  I'm excited to see where that.
[26:26.510 --> 26:27.750]  Yeah, I don't know where that's going to go.
[26:28.770 --> 26:33.510]  Well, I just want to point like, OK, maybe hard for me to find me saying my full name.
[26:33.990 --> 26:39.410]  I pulled audio from Chump, which is a show Gavin has been on a few times.
[26:39.650 --> 26:44.430]  And the whole point of that show is to say if someone is telling the truth or is lying
[26:44.430 --> 26:49.170]  and you'd think a show where they say, are they lying constantly?
[26:49.550 --> 26:50.350]  Gavin would say it.
[26:50.490 --> 26:51.610]  He refuses to.
[26:51.790 --> 26:54.970]  He uses every other possible word but liar.
[26:55.150 --> 26:56.190]  It is impressive.
[26:56.510 --> 26:57.530]  It is so frustrating.
[26:57.970 --> 26:59.610]  I don't I think he's telling the truth.
[26:59.710 --> 27:00.390]  Do you think he's lying?
[27:00.450 --> 27:01.450]  I think he's telling the truth.
[27:01.690 --> 27:02.850]  I think that's bollocks.
[27:03.070 --> 27:04.930]  He never fucking says lie.
[27:05.810 --> 27:11.190]  You'll be mad because in episode with Alfredo, I referred to him as liar the entire game.
[27:11.290 --> 27:13.470]  Like I called him by the name liar.
[27:14.770 --> 27:17.970]  That's where I think I pulled the liar from or I found the liar.
[27:18.190 --> 27:22.050]  OK, you could probably watch any faking it episode from Achievement Hunter.
[27:22.330 --> 27:22.930]  Get it that way.
[27:23.330 --> 27:24.010]  I didn't go there.
[27:24.530 --> 27:27.390]  I thought Chump would be an easy pull for that word.
[27:27.630 --> 27:30.730]  I only I only used clips from F*** Face.
[27:30.930 --> 27:34.750]  I will say that everything was was lifted from the episode.
[27:34.750 --> 27:36.370]  So you're limited in your vision is what you're saying.
[27:36.650 --> 27:39.350]  No, I'm just trying to keep it germane to the to the point of the show.
[27:39.650 --> 27:40.450]  Here's the thing, Andrew.
[27:40.550 --> 27:44.410]  I feel like if you'd have taken this court date seriously and you'd come...
[27:44.410 --> 27:49.550]  If you got through the proper channels, all this stuff, I think you would have been OK.
[27:50.090 --> 27:51.530]  Because I am OK. I won the case.
[27:51.930 --> 27:52.290]  You didn't win.
[27:52.510 --> 27:53.270]  Shit, Eric.
[27:53.290 --> 27:53.790]  No, it's over.
[27:54.270 --> 27:55.590]  Where's the judge, Eric?
[27:55.830 --> 27:56.170]  It's over.
[27:56.570 --> 27:58.510]  Cover up is bigger than the lie at this point.
[27:58.510 --> 28:00.450]  If he wants to take the audio from the case.
[28:00.790 --> 28:04.490]  As I was building the case against you, you know, finding the clips that I presented as
[28:04.490 --> 28:09.130]  evidence last week, I noticed that there would have been there would have been a valid path
[28:09.130 --> 28:10.490]  you could have taken to get out of it.
[28:10.530 --> 28:11.390]  You didn't choose that.
[28:11.390 --> 28:15.970]  You just denied it being you and you made up and then you made up some bullshit audio
[28:15.970 --> 28:17.630]  and then you went to court without us.
[28:17.730 --> 28:20.350]  But you didn't actually follow any of the correct channels.
[28:20.490 --> 28:20.510]  You didn't go to court.
[28:22.870 --> 28:23.630]  Where's the judge?
[28:24.210 --> 28:25.230]  We don't need one.
[28:25.910 --> 28:26.590]  I got one more.
[28:26.650 --> 28:30.630]  I got one last clip audio if you want just to like show how I bring it out.
[28:30.710 --> 28:35.610]  It's sort of weird because we're retracing things I played in the first seven minutes
[28:35.610 --> 28:36.150]  of this podcast.
[28:36.470 --> 28:37.550]  Yeah, I don't listen to this podcast.
[28:37.770 --> 28:39.150]  If you want me to hear it, you better play it here.
[28:39.210 --> 28:39.830]  Yeah, I'm going to.
[28:39.950 --> 28:40.610]  No, don't play me.
[28:40.610 --> 28:41.730]  I'm going to play this.
[28:41.850 --> 28:47.210]  This is, once again, it just shows how sad it is that Garfield jealousy has taken such
[28:47.210 --> 28:52.170]  a toll on the two of you that you have turned to this level.
[28:52.290 --> 28:52.930]  You've gone this low.
[28:53.030 --> 28:54.090]  This is some audio.
[28:54.370 --> 28:56.650]  Andrew will drop whatever he's doing to help me.
[28:56.790 --> 28:57.670]  I love him so much.
[28:57.870 --> 28:58.890]  He's like my other daughter.
[28:59.150 --> 29:01.350]  He's like my other daughter.
[29:01.510 --> 29:03.970]  Oh no, why were we so nice about him?
[29:04.290 --> 29:07.290]  To go from there to now, it's sad.
[29:07.650 --> 29:08.790]  I'm saddened by this.
[29:08.790 --> 29:11.130]  I miss, I miss, I miss you too.
[29:11.750 --> 29:14.250]  You've changed due to this Garfield experience.
[29:14.730 --> 29:18.910]  I've also, dude, I don't think Gavin gives a shit about Garfield.
[29:19.490 --> 29:21.090]  No, I'm not jealous.
[29:21.730 --> 29:22.370]  I'm not jealous.
[29:22.550 --> 29:24.150]  I just, I just fucking hate it.
[29:24.610 --> 29:30.530]  I will say, though, I believe if I'm correct, unless it's been changed, don't I have like
[29:30.530 --> 29:32.370]  the number one time on one of those levels?
[29:32.930 --> 29:35.730]  No, much like Gavin's evidence that's fake.
[29:35.830 --> 29:36.390]  That was manufactured.
[29:36.390 --> 29:37.610]  Mm hmm.
[29:37.670 --> 29:41.250]  So, Andrew, you couldn't beat fake Geoff's time again?
[29:41.650 --> 29:43.290]  I haven't really tried, to be honest.
[29:43.490 --> 29:44.470]  I've been kind of wrapped up.
[29:44.530 --> 29:44.990]  No, I haven't.
[29:45.410 --> 29:45.810]  Just being honest.
[29:45.810 --> 29:46.810]  You've been wrapped up in what?
[29:46.870 --> 29:48.270]  You didn't, you didn't do court properly.
[29:48.370 --> 29:48.910]  What have you been wrapped up in?
[29:48.930 --> 29:50.750]  I'm the only one that did court properly.
[29:50.910 --> 29:52.230]  That's an insane statement.
[29:52.370 --> 29:53.550]  I'm the only one that did it.
[29:53.930 --> 29:55.410]  I feel like there's no end in sight.
[29:55.490 --> 29:57.390]  There's no closure on any of this.
[29:57.530 --> 29:59.230]  It's absolutely closed.
[29:59.350 --> 29:59.870]  What do you mean?
[29:59.890 --> 30:01.250]  We promised court this week.
[30:01.390 --> 30:05.350]  Andrew is over here telling us, Andrew is over here telling us that the court,
[30:05.350 --> 30:07.610]  the case is closed and he won the case.
[30:07.990 --> 30:12.690]  But he doesn't know who the judge was or and he hasn't heard their ruling.
[30:13.170 --> 30:14.290]  He's just assuming.
[30:14.550 --> 30:16.630]  You do need to hear the judge's ruling, you idiot.
[30:17.030 --> 30:20.310]  How can you lose a case when there's no evidence on the other side?
[30:20.630 --> 30:22.510]  Well, I gave the evidence last week, Andrew.
[30:22.710 --> 30:23.150]  Doesn't count.
[30:23.470 --> 30:24.090]  You weren't at court.
[30:24.130 --> 30:24.770]  You didn't present it.
[30:24.870 --> 30:25.810]  I presented my evidence.
[30:25.910 --> 30:26.410]  I went to court.
[30:26.490 --> 30:27.170]  I showed up on time.
[30:27.210 --> 30:27.830]  I gave my case.
[30:28.050 --> 30:30.790]  I even said, Geoff and Gavin, the floor is yours.
[30:31.050 --> 30:31.890]  Take it away.
[30:32.590 --> 30:32.990]  Silence.
[30:33.490 --> 30:34.250]  Because you weren't there.
[30:34.770 --> 30:35.050]  Eric.
[30:35.050 --> 30:36.250]  That's a choice you both made.
[30:36.850 --> 30:41.830]  Eric, you're the you're the the judge or the person who negotiates with the judge.
[30:41.990 --> 30:44.210]  What's the what's the official ruling here?
[30:44.330 --> 30:46.190]  Can you tell us what the what the judge said?
[30:46.350 --> 30:47.310]  You, you shut up.
[30:47.690 --> 30:48.570]  Can you tell us what the judge said?
[30:49.470 --> 30:52.050]  I've only just now received the evidence.
[30:52.210 --> 30:54.610]  So in order to have an impartial ruling.
[30:54.730 --> 30:54.990]  What?
[30:55.450 --> 30:58.350]  No, I only just received it.
[30:58.470 --> 31:02.310]  How's it began and ended in court when you've only just seen the evidence?
[31:02.470 --> 31:03.130]  Here's the thing.
[31:03.130 --> 31:05.230]  I want it because we're making a fucking podcast.
[31:05.590 --> 31:08.290]  I wanted to surprise you two on the show.
[31:08.450 --> 31:10.970]  So I didn't send Nick the evidence yet.
[31:11.310 --> 31:12.130]  It's all recorded.
[31:12.190 --> 31:13.370]  It was documented live.
[31:13.510 --> 31:14.110]  He has it.
[31:14.190 --> 31:15.050]  Nick has the evidence.
[31:15.250 --> 31:16.430]  But Nick's not the judge.
[31:16.690 --> 31:18.490]  No, but he's collecting the evidence.
[31:19.370 --> 31:20.330]  He was there to record it.
[31:20.790 --> 31:22.250]  OK, so he's like court secretary.
[31:22.670 --> 31:22.850]  Yeah.
[31:23.050 --> 31:26.010]  Well, and the court secretary didn't give the evidence to the judge.
[31:26.010 --> 31:27.130]  So there can be no ruling.
[31:27.510 --> 31:27.610]  Why?
[31:28.190 --> 31:29.310]  That is correct.
[31:29.410 --> 31:31.990]  You can't have a court without a judge or a prosecution.
[31:31.990 --> 31:32.970]  Eric's not even the judge.
[31:33.510 --> 31:34.610]  What is the matter of Eric?
[31:34.610 --> 31:37.410]  We agreed that Eric was the judge last time.
[31:37.470 --> 31:39.110]  No, we did not agree.
[31:39.250 --> 31:40.770]  Eric was never going to be the judge.
[31:40.810 --> 31:42.670]  We'll have a fucking case about that.
[31:42.850 --> 31:45.070]  If you want, we'll do another court case about that.
[31:45.110 --> 31:50.250]  Because I distinctly fucking remember after being railroaded out as judge,
[31:50.310 --> 31:52.670]  which I would have been incredibly fair and impartial, by the way,
[31:53.330 --> 31:56.370]  that it was determined that Eric would be as the producer
[31:56.370 --> 31:59.210]  and an impartial person that he would be our judge.
[31:59.530 --> 32:01.630]  Once again, I don't want to step on the bit.
[32:01.630 --> 32:04.050]  I agree that we agreed to that in the time.
[32:04.490 --> 32:07.550]  But since I'm the only one that really cares about this goddamn case,
[32:07.630 --> 32:10.250]  the only one that showed up, I've been talking to Eric about it.
[32:10.650 --> 32:12.910]  And he said he was going to get a different judge.
[32:13.190 --> 32:14.930]  Why is he so confused now, though?
[32:15.150 --> 32:18.070]  I wanted true impartiality for what's going on here.
[32:18.110 --> 32:21.350]  So that way you couldn't hold this against me and be mean to me in the future.
[32:21.590 --> 32:26.270]  So now I have all the evidence that I'll need.
[32:26.350 --> 32:29.050]  So that way we can get a proper ruling from a judge.
[32:29.150 --> 32:30.990]  They don't get to display their evidence.
[32:30.990 --> 32:31.850]  They weren't at court.
[32:31.970 --> 32:33.990]  You can't mail in your evidence a day later.
[32:34.390 --> 32:35.610]  It's not how it works.
[32:36.290 --> 32:38.290]  If you notify the court ahead of time, I believe you can.
[32:38.570 --> 32:42.290]  You can't do it 90 minutes before it's supposed to start.
[32:42.490 --> 32:43.370]  It's a big trial.
[32:43.730 --> 32:44.590]  It's a whole football game.
[32:45.190 --> 32:46.130]  What do you mean?
[32:46.390 --> 32:47.790]  No, first of all, you have no idea.
[32:48.070 --> 32:48.730]  Oh, you mean?
[32:48.990 --> 32:50.710]  OK, no, I'm sorry.
[32:50.830 --> 32:52.890]  I thought you meant actual football, not soccer.
[32:53.030 --> 32:54.170]  I had to translate my head.
[32:54.770 --> 32:56.210]  Football games are way longer in my head.
[32:56.790 --> 32:58.030]  That wasn't a diss on...
[32:58.710 --> 32:59.470]  It doesn't matter.
[32:59.710 --> 33:00.370]  Regional thing.
[33:00.370 --> 33:02.350]  But I don't want Eric to...
[33:02.350 --> 33:03.370]  I don't want to step on the bit.
[33:03.450 --> 33:04.650]  You need to fucking eat the bit.
[33:05.010 --> 33:05.730]  The bit's a pencil.
[33:06.090 --> 33:07.210]  I'm not eating anything.
[33:07.470 --> 33:09.670]  You're going to go from courtroom to courtroom at this point.
[33:09.890 --> 33:10.830]  No, I won the case.
[33:10.910 --> 33:11.470]  There's nothing...
[33:11.470 --> 33:11.910]  What do you mean?
[33:12.150 --> 33:13.230]  What else would I be tried for?
[33:13.410 --> 33:15.370]  So what does Eric have to do with his evidence now?
[33:15.450 --> 33:16.270]  What's the next step?
[33:16.610 --> 33:17.430]  I mean, whatever he wants.
[33:17.510 --> 33:20.470]  I don't think he even needs to send it because I'm the only one that should.
[33:20.770 --> 33:24.650]  I'll be taking it to an impartial third party and receiving a ruling.
[33:25.090 --> 33:26.530]  And then that ruling...
[33:26.530 --> 33:31.050]  That ruling will be what we abide by in the show f*** face.
[33:31.390 --> 33:32.050]  No, not...
[33:32.050 --> 33:35.630]  If you present any of their evidence, that is total bullshit.
[33:36.170 --> 33:36.890]  They did not show up.
[33:36.950 --> 33:37.810]  This is insane.
[33:38.410 --> 33:39.330]  They didn't show up.
[33:40.150 --> 33:41.070]  Eric, what do you want me to say?
[33:41.370 --> 33:42.410]  We're going to need to see this evidence.
[33:42.830 --> 33:44.270]  Hey guys, Eric here.
[33:44.370 --> 33:47.630]  I decided that I'm the judge now and Andrew has to eat the pencil.
[33:48.490 --> 33:49.870]  That doesn't mean anything.
[33:49.970 --> 33:50.790]  You can't just decide.
[33:51.350 --> 33:53.770]  Hey guys, I decided I'm the judge.
[33:54.070 --> 33:55.210]  Go fuck all of you.
[33:55.310 --> 33:56.270]  I'm not eating your pencil.
[33:56.270 --> 33:57.310]  I won the case already.
[33:57.510 --> 33:58.630]  I can say things too.
[33:58.850 --> 33:59.430]  I showed up.
[33:59.550 --> 34:00.490]  I followed the process.
[34:00.870 --> 34:01.730]  You did say things.
[34:01.810 --> 34:04.550]  You said I'm going to eat a pencil if I lose the burger bet.
[34:04.730 --> 34:05.270]  That's what you said.
[34:05.370 --> 34:05.770]  That's one thing I never said.
[34:06.030 --> 34:06.450]  Never happened.
[34:07.130 --> 34:08.790]  You won't find a clip of me saying that anyway.
[34:09.470 --> 34:10.630]  I think this went well.
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.300]  Buenos dias!
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.480]  Café Bustelo Espresso styled iced coffee is hitting refrigerators with a cold front
[34:23.480 --> 34:25.100]  that'll sweep through your senses.
[34:25.340 --> 34:28.700]  So keep the coffee pours long and the cold sits low.
[34:28.700 --> 34:30.720]  Café Bustelo está aquí.
[34:32.140 --> 34:33.380]  To you, my darling.
[34:33.480 --> 34:34.220]  No, to you.
[34:34.400 --> 34:35.960]  The roses were living the dream.
[34:36.060 --> 34:37.180]  More champagne for me, please.
[34:37.500 --> 34:39.360]  Until it all came crashing down.
[34:39.720 --> 34:40.520]  You got fired.
[34:40.640 --> 34:40.940]  Fired?
[34:41.380 --> 34:43.160]  From the director of Meet the Parents.
[34:43.260 --> 34:44.820]  You're a failure, women don't like that.
[34:44.900 --> 34:47.560]  If you need a shoulder or an inner thigh, the lean one.
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.380]  On August 29th.
[34:49.400 --> 34:50.560]  I just want the house.
[34:50.720 --> 34:51.520]  We want everything.
[34:51.700 --> 34:51.960]  Wow.
[34:52.320 --> 34:52.780]  Stop.
[34:52.900 --> 34:53.440]  You stop!
[34:53.700 --> 34:54.940]  And see the roses.
[34:55.540 --> 34:56.480]  These people.
[34:56.480 --> 34:57.340]  The roses.
[34:57.720 --> 34:58.280]  Rated R.
[34:58.400 --> 34:59.020]  Under 17.
[34:59.080 --> 34:59.920]  Not a minute without parent.
[35:00.160 --> 35:02.220]  In theaters everywhere August 29th.
[35:02.280 --> 35:04.140]  At Cox, we're always a step ahead.
[35:04.260 --> 35:06.880]  Like your dog who barks before the doorbell rings.
[35:07.940 --> 35:09.960]  Senses trouble before there's trouble.
[35:10.100 --> 35:13.660]  Like advanced security that blocks online threats before they happen.
[35:13.900 --> 35:16.540]  And knows when the peanut butter's hiding medicine.
[35:16.800 --> 35:18.660]  That's why we keep surprises off your belt.
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.700]  With Price Lock, the price of your internet and mobile plan won't go up for up to three years guaranteed.
[35:24.040 --> 35:24.980]  Right, Sir Barkalot?
[35:24.980 --> 35:26.600]  Cox, a step ahead.
[35:26.780 --> 35:30.680]  Requires at least 500 megabits per second speeds and can get unlimited mobile taxes and fees excluded from Price Lock.
[35:30.740 --> 35:32.180]  Mobile data speeds reduce after 20 gigs.
[35:32.340 --> 35:35.000]  Do you have a moose near the caboose that needs to be tamed?
[35:36.320 --> 35:38.420]  I don't know who writes this.
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.380]  I'm talking to Harry Big.
[35:40.620 --> 35:44.000]  And listen, we're on this ride together, audience.
[35:44.140 --> 35:44.880]  Me and you.
[35:44.920 --> 35:46.320]  You're listening to this ad read.
[35:46.340 --> 35:47.440]  I'm living it.
[35:47.660 --> 35:51.740]  So let's ride this ride together.
[35:51.860 --> 35:53.160]  Hands inside the car.
[35:53.160 --> 35:56.240]  And we'll see how fast it goes.
[35:56.680 --> 36:00.360]  I'm talking to Harry Big and needs some support.
[36:01.260 --> 36:09.260]  Thankfully, our sponsor today, Manscaped, has you covered to keep the hair looking nice and trimmed and feeling fully supported.
[36:09.640 --> 36:13.300]  Manscaped offers precision engineered tools for your family jewels.
[36:13.740 --> 36:16.520]  I have the giggles today reading this ad.
[36:16.900 --> 36:17.480]  Beluga!
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.300]  Did you hear that?
[36:19.540 --> 36:22.220]  That's your moose asking for Manscaped.
[36:22.220 --> 36:25.760]  I don't want to say that my balls look like...
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.620]  Oh, I don't know, Ryan Reynolds without his costume on in Deadpool or anything.
[36:30.840 --> 36:32.380]  But I've got some scars.
[36:32.780 --> 36:33.380]  It's not fun.
[36:33.660 --> 36:35.920]  It's like a paper cut times a thousand.
[36:36.300 --> 36:37.840]  Well, thank God that the man...
[36:37.840 --> 36:40.640]  If you believe in him or her or they or...
[36:40.640 --> 36:48.020]  And if you don't, thank the universe that the Manscaped engineering team just perfected the greatest ball hair trimmer ever created.
[36:48.360 --> 36:50.540]  The Lawnmower 3.0.
[36:50.540 --> 36:52.940]  Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.
[36:52.940 --> 36:54.020]  Cut those balls.
[36:54.160 --> 36:54.920]  Cut those balls.
[36:55.260 --> 36:56.060]  Don't cut the balls.
[36:56.340 --> 36:57.100]  Just cut the hair.
[36:57.420 --> 37:05.660]  You can get this trimmer inside the Perfect Package 3.0, which also includes the Manscaped Crop Preserver, Ball Deodorant and the Crop Reviver.
[37:05.800 --> 37:09.640]  Man, I got a whiff of my balls the other day after cutting the grass.
[37:09.700 --> 37:12.180]  It was about 110 degrees outside and I almost...
[37:12.180 --> 37:12.740]  I got woozy.
[37:13.300 --> 37:14.700]  I got woozy from my ball smell.
[37:15.020 --> 37:17.460]  Anyway, they're super practical and they smell great too.
[37:17.460 --> 37:22.180]  Plus, for a limited time when you order the Perfect Package Kit, you get two free gifts.
[37:22.620 --> 37:28.140]  The Shed Travel Bag and the Manscaped Anti-Chafing Boxer Briefs.
[37:28.520 --> 37:29.860]  You need to try this out for yourself.
[37:30.240 --> 37:37.300]  So get 20% off plus free shipping by going to manscaped.com and using code FACE20.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.220]  Your balls will thank you.
[37:39.420 --> 37:45.220]  Get 20% off and free shipping at manscaped.com with code FACED20.
[37:45.220 --> 37:50.820]  That's 20% off with free shipping at manscaped.com using code FACE20.
[37:51.100 --> 37:54.800]  From the moose to the caboose, always use the right tools for the job.
[37:54.960 --> 37:55.860]  I wish I had a moose.
[37:56.260 --> 37:57.140]  I have more of a meese.
[37:57.580 --> 38:00.440]  There are tons of VPN providers out there.
[38:00.640 --> 38:02.600]  You've probably heard of a couple of them.
[38:02.860 --> 38:05.460]  And so you may have even used a VPN before.
[38:05.860 --> 38:10.580]  But I'd like to do research on my sponsors and I only recommend brands to my listeners
[38:10.580 --> 38:12.340]  that I believe in.
[38:12.340 --> 38:18.020]  I can say with full confidence that ExpressVPN is the best VPN on the market.
[38:18.460 --> 38:19.220]  Here is why.
[38:20.320 --> 38:22.220]  ExpressVPN doesn't log your data.
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.440]  Lots of really cheap or free VPNs make money by selling your data to add companies.
[38:27.700 --> 38:33.220]  ExpressVPN developed a technology called Trusted Server that makes it impossible
[38:33.220 --> 38:35.720]  for their servers to log any of your info.
[38:35.840 --> 38:36.620]  Second is speed.
[38:36.820 --> 38:38.660]  I've tried lots of VPNs in the past.
[38:38.660 --> 38:42.680]  Many slow you and your connection down or make your device sluggish.
[38:43.020 --> 38:49.120]  I've been using ExpressVPN for a large amount of time and my internet speeds are blazing fast.
[38:49.180 --> 38:54.280]  Even when I connect to servers thousands of miles away, which I do, I can still stream
[38:54.280 --> 38:57.900]  quality HD videos with zero lag, which I do.
[38:58.300 --> 39:04.640]  The last thing that really sets ExpressVPN apart from the other VPNs is how easy it is to use.
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.860]  Unlike other VPNs, you don't have to input or program anything.
[39:09.460 --> 39:12.440]  You just fire up the app and click one button to connect.
[39:12.520 --> 39:13.120]  It's easy.
[39:13.480 --> 39:15.360]  Even your grandparents could use it.
[39:15.780 --> 39:17.340]  And it's not just me saying this.
[39:17.580 --> 39:23.960]  Wired, The Verge, CNET, and many other tech experts rate ExpressVPN as the number one
[39:23.960 --> 39:26.120]  VPN in the world.
[39:26.380 --> 39:30.040]  So protect yourself with the VPN that I use and trust.
[39:30.040 --> 39:38.560]  I, Geoff Ramsey, use my link expressvpn.com slash face today and get an extra three months
[39:38.560 --> 39:40.460]  free on a one year package.
[39:40.580 --> 39:44.060]  That's expressvpn.com slash face.
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.380]  Visit expressvpn.com slash face to learn more.
[39:49.720 --> 39:57.240]  This has been a Geoff Ramsey ad read, not a robot impersonating Geoff Ramsey, who is not
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.220]  captured and hidden under the Vatican as a part of a global conspiracy.
[40:02.660 --> 40:03.840]  Robot Geoff out.
[40:05.620 --> 40:06.600]  I feel like...
[40:07.940 --> 40:08.300]  Let me see.
[40:08.420 --> 40:09.020]  Let's try this.
[40:09.140 --> 40:09.940]  This is Andrew Pantin.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.100]  I've promised something.
[40:11.180 --> 40:12.860]  I just planned the same thing over and over.
[40:13.260 --> 40:14.620]  So I'm going to eat a box of pencils.
[40:14.660 --> 40:16.360]  It took three hours to make that, right?
[40:16.480 --> 40:17.560]  It says it did.
[40:17.660 --> 40:18.440]  It did take over.
[40:18.520 --> 40:19.140]  It took three hours.
[40:20.220 --> 40:22.540]  I believe I heard you say you were going to eat a box of pencils.
[40:22.720 --> 40:23.860]  I don't even want you to eat the box.
[40:23.940 --> 40:24.800]  Just one of the pencils.
[40:25.160 --> 40:25.480]  I haven't.
[40:25.560 --> 40:25.860]  I'm not.
[40:25.960 --> 40:26.980]  I'm not eating any pencils.
[40:26.980 --> 40:28.020]  I won the case.
[40:28.140 --> 40:29.000]  There's no need for me to.
[40:29.240 --> 40:30.640]  If I would have lost the case, I would have done it.
[40:30.900 --> 40:33.160]  We've been recording for 32 minutes.
[40:33.600 --> 40:34.860]  You've been recording longer, obviously.
[40:35.280 --> 40:39.880]  But we still have potentially 8 to 10 minutes of pencil eating to go.
[40:40.660 --> 40:42.780]  So if you want to just grab the nearest pencil and crack on.
[40:43.100 --> 40:44.120]  There's no reason for me to.
[40:44.160 --> 40:45.360]  If I lost the case, I would have done it.
[40:45.400 --> 40:46.260]  I'm an honorable guy.
[40:46.360 --> 40:47.280]  I'm a trustworthy guy.
[40:47.500 --> 40:48.720]  I think I've established that.
[40:48.940 --> 40:49.940]  Did you not just hear Eric?
[40:50.420 --> 40:51.640]  He just said you lost the case.
[40:51.860 --> 40:53.440]  No, it doesn't matter what Eric says.
[40:53.800 --> 40:54.660]  The case is done.
[40:55.200 --> 40:55.860]  It's over.
[40:55.860 --> 40:56.980]  It happened.
[40:58.360 --> 41:00.900]  We're like five minutes away from sending in bailiffs.
[41:02.800 --> 41:05.200]  You know, the saddest thing to come out of this, Gavin,
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.720]  is finding out that our friend Andrew has no valor.
[41:09.060 --> 41:10.860]  No, no valor, no honor.
[41:11.460 --> 41:14.540]  And there's just no hint of any gentlemanly conduct.
[41:14.760 --> 41:16.520]  And it's sad to realize.
[41:16.760 --> 41:23.640]  I thought this was going to be real court, real evidence getting presented, real emotion.
[41:23.640 --> 41:26.840]  And it's just, just passive garbage.
[41:27.160 --> 41:28.120]  It's a kangaroo court.
[41:28.280 --> 41:29.180]  It's a kangaroo court.
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.060]  No, I was at the...
[41:31.060 --> 41:32.580]  Hey, I was the only one at the kangaroo court.
[41:32.900 --> 41:33.440]  I showed up.
[41:33.500 --> 41:34.880]  I was very gentlemanly yesterday.
[41:35.080 --> 41:40.900]  You showed up for the case that wasn't happening because your dumb ass can't join Slack properly.
[41:41.300 --> 41:42.060]  No, I...
[41:42.060 --> 41:42.920]  Everybody was aware.
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.760]  You can't change the judge case 90 minutes before it happens.
[41:47.160 --> 41:47.540]  To a...
[41:48.480 --> 41:49.200]  Google it.
[41:49.600 --> 41:50.620]  No, look into it.
[41:50.620 --> 41:53.920]  I think both parties need to agree or the court needs to agree.
[41:54.200 --> 41:55.980]  No, if you went to a movie premiere...
[41:56.540 --> 41:57.080]  Eric is the court!
[41:57.460 --> 42:00.680]  And the movie was pushed today, but you still went the day before.
[42:01.080 --> 42:02.760]  You didn't... it doesn't mean you saw the movie.
[42:02.900 --> 42:04.800]  You stood outside in the rain.
[42:05.300 --> 42:05.660]  You did nothing.
[42:05.660 --> 42:06.300]  No, but I went to the thing.
[42:06.460 --> 42:07.260]  No, I went to the court.
[42:07.380 --> 42:10.560]  You can't, you can't, like, you can't have a case coming up and be like,
[42:10.640 --> 42:12.340]  actually, I want to, I'm going to get lunch.
[42:12.420 --> 42:14.200]  So let's just push this to a different day.
[42:14.580 --> 42:15.260]  Can't do that.
[42:15.400 --> 42:16.700]  Because that's what happened.
[42:16.980 --> 42:17.640]  That is what happened.
[42:18.260 --> 42:20.180]  You moved it 90 minutes before.
[42:20.180 --> 42:24.640]  If you would have put it out on Wednesday, you would have said, hey, can't do it.
[42:24.720 --> 42:25.740]  Got a dental thing.
[42:26.020 --> 42:27.140]  No problem at all.
[42:27.560 --> 42:29.460]  We would have had a... you would have been there, I guess.
[42:29.900 --> 42:30.620]  But you didn't.
[42:30.720 --> 42:31.880]  You waited 90 minutes before.
[42:31.980 --> 42:32.620]  That's too soon.
[42:33.000 --> 42:33.600]  That's unreasonable.
[42:34.220 --> 42:35.500]  When did you go to court, Andrew?
[42:35.960 --> 42:37.900]  I went to court at the recorded time.
[42:38.220 --> 42:40.120]  So yesterday, yesterday at 4?
[42:40.520 --> 42:41.340]  1 p.m. for me.
[42:41.580 --> 42:41.820]  Okay.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.140]  I went at noon.
[42:44.060 --> 42:45.000]  And it doesn't matter.
[42:45.100 --> 42:46.440]  That was before the case happened.
[42:47.020 --> 42:47.940]  That was the case.
[42:48.120 --> 42:48.940]  You can't show up.
[42:48.940 --> 42:49.640]  It's your analogy.
[42:49.860 --> 42:51.820]  Once again, you're just standing outside of a building.
[42:51.920 --> 42:52.740]  What are you talking about?
[42:53.780 --> 42:55.600]  I waited for our case to begin.
[42:55.680 --> 42:57.080]  I went when the doors opened and I went in.
[42:57.400 --> 43:00.400]  I didn't expect this to be something we talked about for like 30 minutes.
[43:00.580 --> 43:01.800]  I felt it was pretty clear.
[43:01.900 --> 43:03.180]  I felt like it was pretty straightforward.
[43:03.740 --> 43:04.260]  I won.
[43:04.620 --> 43:05.740]  I'm sorry you missed it.
[43:05.800 --> 43:07.780]  You didn't think we would be outraged by your behavior?
[43:08.300 --> 43:08.640]  No.
[43:08.760 --> 43:09.320]  What do you mean?
[43:09.760 --> 43:10.440]  You missed it.
[43:10.580 --> 43:11.640]  Can I... one point of clarification.
[43:11.860 --> 43:15.460]  Andrew keeps throwing the word 90... the time frame 90 minutes around.
[43:15.940 --> 43:18.840]  Our podcast starts recording at what time on Thursdays, typically?
[43:19.340 --> 43:20.100]  1 p.m.
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.660]  I notified everyone at 12 24.
[43:24.280 --> 43:27.100]  So that's two and a half hours before 90 minutes.
[43:27.200 --> 43:29.160]  That's as long as a football game.
[43:29.160 --> 43:29.760]  No, it was...
[43:30.800 --> 43:31.840]  I got the email.
[43:31.880 --> 43:32.920]  That's the funniest thing.
[43:33.580 --> 43:35.300]  90 minutes is like an exaggeration.
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.020]  It's just it was more like I got it like an hour 45 minutes, but that's just not fun to say.
[43:40.240 --> 43:44.020]  It's a lot of unnecessary syllables in that 90 minutes.
[43:44.120 --> 43:45.020]  We're not in court, Eric.
[43:45.340 --> 43:47.000]  I can't be lying in court if we're not in court.
[43:47.220 --> 43:48.840]  Eric just typed he's lying in court.
[43:49.400 --> 43:49.860]  I'm not.
[43:50.280 --> 43:53.520]  We're going to have to... no, okay, so you may have done court and we may not be doing court now,
[43:53.920 --> 43:56.040]  but we're going to... it's void.
[43:56.300 --> 43:58.860]  The whole the whole trial is a mistrial.
[43:59.320 --> 43:59.900]  We're going again.
[44:00.400 --> 44:00.820]  We're going again.
[44:01.580 --> 44:02.280]  Double jeopardy.
[44:02.700 --> 44:03.480]  Sure, it's a mistrial.
[44:03.560 --> 44:04.460]  I agree there.
[44:04.780 --> 44:05.240]  It's done.
[44:05.380 --> 44:07.120]  I can't be charged for eating a pencil twice.
[44:07.660 --> 44:08.180]  It's over.
[44:08.500 --> 44:09.500]  For not eating a pencil.
[44:10.000 --> 44:10.800]  It doesn't matter.
[44:11.300 --> 44:14.720]  You can't charge me for the same thing twice of accusing me of saying...
[44:14.720 --> 44:17.280]  No, you can't prosecute you twice.
[44:17.920 --> 44:19.680]  You haven't been prosecuted once.
[44:20.300 --> 44:21.220]  No, we can't do this again.
[44:21.280 --> 44:22.080]  We already did it once.
[44:22.160 --> 44:22.840]  You can be charged.
[44:22.860 --> 44:24.220]  We didn't do anything at any point.
[44:24.500 --> 44:25.360]  We did no court.
[44:25.700 --> 44:27.240]  And hey, to you, there was no court.
[44:27.340 --> 44:28.520]  To me, there was a lot of court.
[44:28.900 --> 44:29.940]  I went to a lot of court.
[44:30.520 --> 44:32.700]  I thought you would come in with more lawyer shit.
[44:33.080 --> 44:34.140]  You came in with nothing.
[44:34.260 --> 44:35.080]  You just said I'd done it.
[44:35.120 --> 44:35.660]  I didn't need to.
[44:35.760 --> 44:36.520]  I was an innocent man.
[44:36.860 --> 44:37.860]  I presented my case.
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.200]  All you came in with was an attempt at destroying my family from the inside out.
[44:42.340 --> 44:42.900]  Not at all.
[44:43.080 --> 44:44.900]  All because you're not man enough to eat a pencil.
[44:45.200 --> 44:46.300]  I'll tell you who I feel sorry for.
[44:46.300 --> 44:50.820]  I feel sorry for you because the audience is not going to react well to this.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.160]  You are going to...
[44:52.160 --> 44:52.800]  I agree.
[44:52.980 --> 44:57.560]  I think they're going to be very upset that the two of you are continuing to try to bully me
[44:57.560 --> 44:59.960]  into eating this pencil that I never said I would eat.
[45:01.140 --> 45:02.480]  I think they're going to be outraged.
[45:02.800 --> 45:05.760]  When you were at school and you didn't do your homework,
[45:05.900 --> 45:06.500]  and the teacher's like,
[45:06.580 --> 45:07.240]  Andrea, where's your homework?
[45:07.380 --> 45:08.120]  You would just be like,
[45:08.340 --> 45:08.800]  I did it.
[45:08.840 --> 45:09.300]  I got an A.
[45:09.840 --> 45:10.220]  No.
[45:10.380 --> 45:11.320]  You didn't say I did it.
[45:11.320 --> 45:12.280]  I turned it in yesterday.
[45:12.660 --> 45:13.900]  I'm sorry you weren't here.
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.060]  I came in on Sunday.
[45:16.060 --> 45:17.980]  I got an A and you're too late.
[45:18.220 --> 45:19.280]  Is that what you said to your teacher?
[45:19.620 --> 45:20.420]  I never said that.
[45:20.500 --> 45:23.720]  I would show up to court and school on time as scheduled.
[45:24.440 --> 45:25.060]  That's what I do.
[45:25.500 --> 45:26.200]  I'm reliable.
[45:26.880 --> 45:28.220]  Unlike some people here, apparently.
[45:28.660 --> 45:31.620]  Eric, please schedule Andrew's new court date for him.
[45:31.820 --> 45:33.460]  There's no need for a new court date.
[45:33.540 --> 45:34.240]  We've done court.
[45:34.340 --> 45:34.940]  Court's over.
[45:35.080 --> 45:35.680]  Case done.
[45:36.020 --> 45:36.220]  Nope.
[45:36.420 --> 45:37.480]  I'm sorry you lost.
[45:38.180 --> 45:42.820]  I think you guys had some interesting points that I wish the judge kept in here.
[45:42.840 --> 45:45.220]  You can't keep saying we lost because the judge hasn't ruled yet.
[45:45.220 --> 45:48.980]  The judge who, by the way, you've never met and don't know who is.
[45:49.500 --> 45:50.320]  I don't need to.
[45:50.540 --> 45:53.480]  All you're saying is I presented facts and they didn't.
[45:53.700 --> 45:57.240]  The judge still gets to make a decision, even if he doesn't take our facts into consideration,
[45:57.440 --> 46:00.940]  that he or she or they still get to make a decision.
[46:01.260 --> 46:02.480]  You aren't the fucking judge.
[46:02.700 --> 46:04.400]  You don't get to make the goddamn decision.
[46:04.860 --> 46:07.160]  The judge makes the fucking decision.
[46:07.760 --> 46:10.580]  If this was the first episode of F*** Face that you listened to,
[46:11.480 --> 46:14.340]  have we even said what this whole thing is about?
[46:14.340 --> 46:15.860]  I did in the intro.
[46:15.980 --> 46:18.160]  I recapped it because I know what I'm doing.
[46:18.480 --> 46:18.880]  All right, good.
[46:18.900 --> 46:19.900]  I went to court.
[46:21.480 --> 46:22.240]  Kangaroo court.
[46:22.640 --> 46:23.600]  Call it whatever you want.
[46:23.820 --> 46:29.920]  You've got a mountain of bullshit fucking stuffed into your kangaroo pouch.
[46:30.200 --> 46:34.360]  I don't know how they do the justice system in Canada, but I want nothing to do with it.
[46:35.020 --> 46:38.820]  Typically how it works is you show up when you're assigned and then you discuss,
[46:39.160 --> 46:40.980]  you plead your case, make arguments.
[46:41.340 --> 46:42.260]  I believe that's how it works.
[46:42.380 --> 46:43.800]  I've never been to court before.
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.100]  Would you want to go to court if you'd slipped and you caught your foot on a towel
[46:48.100 --> 46:50.720]  and you knocked all your teeth out on your bathroom floor?
[46:50.780 --> 46:52.180]  Would you want to go to court that day, Andrew?
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.580]  No, but if it happened, that didn't happen.
[46:57.680 --> 46:59.080]  You're just describing a hypothetical.
[46:59.840 --> 47:06.660]  Also, me wanting to go and if I have to go are two completely different questions as well.
[47:07.100 --> 47:07.920]  You're just saying stuff.
[47:08.120 --> 47:09.360]  Here's what I'm going to say, Andrew,
[47:09.760 --> 47:12.440]  and I'm going to put this in Canadian terms so that you can understand.
[47:13.000 --> 47:13.600]  Thank you.
[47:14.040 --> 47:17.220]  What we were hoping for is that you would be a Justin Trudeau,
[47:17.500 --> 47:20.140]  but the reality is you're a Rob Ford.
[47:20.820 --> 47:23.520]  I mean, I think that's just mean. I think that's mean spirit.
[47:23.660 --> 47:24.740]  I showed up on time.
[47:24.740 --> 47:26.300]  I agree. I agree. I agree.
[47:26.820 --> 47:31.760]  You are Toronto's Rob Ford. Rest in peace. He's dead, right?
[47:32.040 --> 47:35.180]  I'm pretty sure he's dead. I'm pretty sure I've never done crack,
[47:35.460 --> 47:38.940]  so I don't think I fit that bill. That was his thing, right?
[47:38.940 --> 47:42.680]  Yeah, he was Toronto's mayor who got caught smoking crack a lot.
[47:42.780 --> 47:43.700]  Yeah. Yeah.
[47:43.880 --> 47:45.260]  I don't think I've ever done that.
[47:45.420 --> 47:50.340]  And he also he also I think he was famous for fucking railroading and bullshitting court cases.
[47:50.940 --> 47:53.740]  Well, I didn't do that either. I showed up on time.
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.040]  Well, apparently, Andrew wins the attendance award.
[47:57.460 --> 47:58.560]  Yeah, yeah, I do.
[47:59.000 --> 48:00.080]  Yeah, you get a gold star.
[48:00.100 --> 48:03.780]  He attended a court case that wasn't happening because everyone else canceled it.
[48:04.240 --> 48:06.420]  Nobody. No, that's not the wording I got.
[48:06.780 --> 48:09.860]  Listen, if I was in that slack, there would be some other context to this.
[48:09.920 --> 48:11.400]  Not my fault. I wasn't in that slack.
[48:11.760 --> 48:13.220]  I think it is 100% your fault.
[48:13.360 --> 48:13.900]  You weren't in the slack.
[48:13.900 --> 48:14.400]  It was my fault.
[48:14.580 --> 48:15.120]  I just admitted.
[48:15.960 --> 48:16.520]  You just admitted.
[48:16.520 --> 48:20.600]  What is it like being against everyone on the podcast every single week?
[48:20.740 --> 48:21.900]  Is it exhausting for you?
[48:22.260 --> 48:24.720]  It's tiring to be the beacon of truth on this show.
[48:24.840 --> 48:27.740]  It is really draining, but you know what?
[48:27.860 --> 48:28.820]  Someone's got to do it.
[48:28.940 --> 48:34.120]  I worry that not only have you become Krampus and you've just embraced that in its entirety,
[48:34.600 --> 48:35.920]  you're starting to kid yourself.
[48:35.920 --> 48:37.960]  You're starting to believe your own shit.
[48:38.080 --> 48:39.260]  I'm starting to kid myself.
[48:39.720 --> 48:40.680]  I'm worried for the future.
[48:40.940 --> 48:41.880]  I'm starting to kid myself.
[48:42.280 --> 48:43.760]  I'm the only one that went to court.
[48:43.940 --> 48:44.540]  I was ready.
[48:45.000 --> 48:45.880]  You didn't go to court!
[48:46.040 --> 48:47.140]  You didn't go to court, Andrew!
[48:47.500 --> 48:49.460]  What's the first seven minutes of this episode?
[48:50.280 --> 48:52.840]  This episode was a 45-minute argument.
[48:54.180 --> 48:54.840]  Still going.
[48:55.680 --> 48:57.120]  I didn't think it would be this long.
[48:57.200 --> 48:58.300]  I had other things I could talk about.
[48:58.320 --> 48:59.320]  Why do you think this?
[48:59.620 --> 49:03.400]  In your head, you would bullshit your way through this whole thing.
[49:03.480 --> 49:04.680]  You'd be like, I went to court yesterday.
[49:04.680 --> 49:07.060]  And you thought we'd go, that's cool, Andrew.
[49:07.140 --> 49:07.560]  Well done.
[49:07.700 --> 49:09.500]  No, I figured there'd be some questions.
[49:09.500 --> 49:10.700]  Good job you didn't have to eat that pencil.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.980]  What other faces have you done this week?
[49:13.040 --> 49:14.260]  You thought that's how it was going to go?
[49:14.540 --> 49:16.760]  I thought I was going to explain what happened.
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.660]  And you two being reasonable people would be like, yeah, we missed the date.
[49:20.720 --> 49:21.120]  You're right.
[49:21.220 --> 49:21.800]  That sucks.
[49:21.920 --> 49:23.200]  Man, we screwed that up.
[49:23.540 --> 49:24.760]  He wins by default.
[49:24.920 --> 49:26.140]  That's because that's what happened.
[49:26.460 --> 49:28.080]  I thought you'd be more accepting more quickly.
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.060]  I didn't think we'd be at technically minute 47-ish of the show and still be talking about
[49:34.060 --> 49:36.260]  this case that I attended and you didn't.
[49:36.540 --> 49:39.380]  You need to write some better fan fiction because that was not how this was going to go.
[49:39.420 --> 49:40.920]  Now you're taking my Twitter lines.
[49:41.080 --> 49:42.680]  This is theft as well.
[49:42.880 --> 49:43.560]  What does that mean?
[49:44.300 --> 49:46.520]  You liked that tweet on Twitter yesterday.
[49:46.900 --> 49:47.500]  About what?
[49:47.840 --> 49:48.280]  Fan fiction.
[49:48.720 --> 49:50.280]  Did you make a tweet about fan fiction yesterday?
[49:50.660 --> 49:51.280]  Yes, I did.
[49:51.700 --> 49:52.340]  I don't remember.
[49:52.480 --> 49:54.480]  Dude, I couldn't fucking count to 10 yesterday.
[49:54.580 --> 49:55.040]  I don't know.
[49:55.420 --> 49:57.400]  I'm saying you subconsciously stole it.
[49:59.460 --> 50:00.340]  Oh boy.
[50:00.720 --> 50:03.980]  Oh, well, I guess we're coming towards the end.
[50:03.980 --> 50:05.540]  I'm disappointed, but...
[50:05.540 --> 50:06.960]  Oh, I mean, there's nothing to be disappointed about.
[50:07.100 --> 50:07.900]  We need a new court date.
[50:08.420 --> 50:09.260]  That's what it comes down to.
[50:09.380 --> 50:10.060]  No, no, we didn't.
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.480]  Hey, speaking of crazy stuff, you ever sit on a toilet that's falling apart while you're
[50:14.480 --> 50:15.100]  trying to use it?
[50:15.100 --> 50:15.940]  Is that cool?
[50:16.560 --> 50:17.920]  Yes, I have.
[50:18.180 --> 50:19.260]  Is this a TUSHY sponsorship?
[50:19.620 --> 50:20.240]  No, it's not.
[50:20.660 --> 50:23.640]  I'm sure their product would actually withstand way better than this.
[50:23.660 --> 50:28.060]  I was trying to take a shit last night and the toilet fell apart while I was using it.
[50:28.460 --> 50:28.700]  Horrible.
[50:28.700 --> 50:29.340]  What does that mean?
[50:29.500 --> 50:31.800]  Like the bolts popped off of it?
[50:32.220 --> 50:33.700]  Not the toilet itself?
[50:33.980 --> 50:35.980]  The seating aspects of it.
[50:36.140 --> 50:39.440]  It's like flying a plane that's falling apart piece by piece.
[50:39.820 --> 50:41.520]  First, because it's already loose.
[50:41.600 --> 50:42.800]  It's kind of like a swivel chair.
[50:42.980 --> 50:44.380]  I should have tightened it down.
[50:44.680 --> 50:46.440]  I've been letting it loose for a while because it's kind of fun.
[50:46.540 --> 50:47.220]  You swivel around.
[50:47.740 --> 50:52.480]  And then while I sat on it, I heard like it started.
[50:52.620 --> 50:55.060]  The swiveling was happening and I was prepared for the swivel.
[50:55.240 --> 50:58.900]  But then the back of the chair popped off, you know, like the lid that you close.
[51:00.080 --> 51:02.160]  So then I was trying to navigate that.
[51:02.160 --> 51:04.680]  I threw the lid to the ground and I'm still...
[51:04.680 --> 51:05.920]  This is all while trying to take a shit.
[51:06.020 --> 51:06.980]  This is very complicated.
[51:07.480 --> 51:12.440]  Then the actual like seat came off and the seat was completely off.
[51:12.600 --> 51:13.760]  It could have fell in the toilet.
[51:13.980 --> 51:15.940]  It was very scary to navigate that.
[51:16.380 --> 51:17.060]  I made it though.
[51:17.400 --> 51:18.240]  So wait, wait.
[51:19.060 --> 51:19.500]  Firstly...
[51:19.500 --> 51:21.360]  I had to reassemble the toilet after I was done.
[51:21.560 --> 51:23.940]  Do you like lean on the lid?
[51:24.280 --> 51:26.440]  I'm always hunched forward when I'm doing twos.
[51:26.620 --> 51:29.200]  No, I'm kind of like I'm stretched back.
[51:29.360 --> 51:29.860]  I'm getting real comfy.
[51:29.860 --> 51:32.720]  Do you know why your seat is swiveling, by the way?
[51:33.240 --> 51:34.900]  I mean, because the bolts were loose on it.
[51:35.100 --> 51:39.940]  No, it's because constant vertical wiping causes a twisting motion.
[51:40.320 --> 51:43.900]  And you've been slowly loosening your toilet every time you've wiped your ass.
[51:44.100 --> 51:48.500]  If there's anyone who is more justified in their vertical wiping, it's me.
[51:48.580 --> 51:49.060]  You see that?
[51:49.260 --> 51:51.480]  I've been tweeted this story like 50 times.
[51:51.600 --> 51:52.820]  That guy that got his dick bit.
[51:53.260 --> 51:53.700]  What?
[51:54.300 --> 51:57.460]  He was on the toilet and a snake came up, bit him in the dick.
[51:57.840 --> 51:59.340]  I can't go down that road.
[51:59.340 --> 52:00.640]  I can't talk about snakes and dicks.
[52:00.820 --> 52:02.840]  That's that's too horrifying for me.
[52:02.920 --> 52:09.300]  But I will say in 1995, when I was in Kuwait in the army, they had they would
[52:09.300 --> 52:12.500]  bring in these portable trailers for you to shit in like a little portable.
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.800]  It would have like two toilets and two urinals and a sink and a shower.
[52:18.340 --> 52:20.300]  And, you know, on day one, it's OK.
[52:20.460 --> 52:22.020]  It's it's it's serviceable.
[52:22.020 --> 52:30.780]  But by like day 60 of thousands of soldiers taking aggressive, manly, military macho shits,
[52:31.120 --> 52:39.500]  it looks like it looks like the house in in in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, essentially.
[52:40.280 --> 52:46.260]  And I it's funny you say that because I sat down on a toilet.
[52:47.060 --> 52:50.520]  In that in one of those porta potties once in the fall of 95
[52:50.520 --> 52:55.220]  and fall of 95, because I also fell and it was a little wiggly like that.
[52:55.320 --> 52:55.940]  And I thought, huh.
[52:56.420 --> 52:59.200]  And then a couple of weeks later, I sat on it again and it was a little more wiggly.
[52:59.320 --> 53:00.940]  And I thought, wow, this thing's not doing too well.
[53:01.900 --> 53:05.640]  And I went to lean back to grab some toilet paper off the because it was like sitting
[53:05.640 --> 53:08.140]  on the back of the thing and the toilet fell through the floor.
[53:09.700 --> 53:11.480]  And I and the toilet fell through the floor.
[53:11.980 --> 53:13.160]  How far did you fall?
[53:14.880 --> 53:15.520]  I fell.
[53:15.860 --> 53:18.660]  I fell 18 inches.
[53:19.580 --> 53:20.100]  Wow.
[53:20.620 --> 53:24.520]  Like like the base of the toilet was under the was through the floor.
[53:24.780 --> 53:27.500]  The bowl caught it and half the back was in.
[53:27.700 --> 53:28.640]  So I was like Lee.
[53:28.740 --> 53:33.640]  It was almost as if I was leaning back in a lazy boy with my legs up in the air,
[53:33.820 --> 53:38.280]  you know, kicking like I'm a cockroach on my back and leaning back against the
[53:38.780 --> 53:40.900]  back against the the the toilet back.
[53:41.400 --> 53:46.340]  And and I had to crawl out and pretend like that wasn't me.
[53:46.380 --> 53:47.200]  And that didn't happen.
[53:47.200 --> 53:51.080]  I just went to a different portable portable party and I never told anybody.
[53:51.220 --> 53:54.000]  And the next day there was tape over that and they fixed it.
[53:54.560 --> 53:58.920]  I was once on a on a film set out in the woods and there was there were these porta
[53:58.920 --> 54:00.500]  parties like two side by side.
[54:00.600 --> 54:04.300]  They were attached together, a little sort of metal staircase leading up to each one.
[54:04.800 --> 54:06.060]  And I was doing a morning too.
[54:06.140 --> 54:08.160]  It's probably like 7 a.m.
[54:08.600 --> 54:11.320]  It was like right before I was about to eat, but I just I didn't have time to poo that
[54:11.320 --> 54:13.620]  morning and heavy dinner last night.
[54:13.960 --> 54:15.220]  Sat there doing all the business.
[54:15.220 --> 54:20.080]  Someone came into the one next door, but tripped on the stairs.
[54:20.220 --> 54:22.080]  And I just heard this massive clang.
[54:22.480 --> 54:27.740]  The entire thing rocked forwards and then rocked back and all of the water splashed
[54:27.740 --> 54:29.060]  up into my undercarriage.
[54:29.240 --> 54:36.180]  And I had to do the entire day without boxes on and with like gammy toilet water all up
[54:36.180 --> 54:36.700]  my back.
[54:36.980 --> 54:38.180]  And I wanted to cry.
[54:38.520 --> 54:38.960]  I wanted to cry.
[54:39.400 --> 54:39.960]  I don't blame you.
[54:40.460 --> 54:41.220]  That's a bad.
[54:41.280 --> 54:42.640]  And those are long days, too.
[54:42.640 --> 54:46.060]  And if I remember if I remember correctly, it was probably cold.
[54:46.580 --> 54:48.700]  Oh, God, it was like November in England.
[54:49.060 --> 54:52.320]  Yeah, I assume you're out doing like like Sherlock Holmes or something because you're
[54:52.320 --> 54:52.740]  out in the woods.
[54:52.840 --> 54:53.780]  I bet it was cold as fuck.
[54:53.940 --> 54:54.780]  Yeah, it was cold as balls.
[54:55.440 --> 54:58.920]  That's probably a day that your balls could have used a nice warm pair of underwear, huh?
[55:00.820 --> 55:02.180]  Yeah, that sucks.
[55:02.660 --> 55:06.240]  You know, while we're on the subject of shits, you know, I was I think I've talked about
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.100]  this in the past, how my girlfriend has never I'm I'm flummoxed by the fact that I've never
[55:11.100 --> 55:13.540]  caught my girlfriend taking a dump and we live together.
[55:13.900 --> 55:19.360]  She moved in in March and I'm still trying just to update, by the way, I'm still trying
[55:19.360 --> 55:23.060]  on almost daily to catch her shitting.
[55:23.460 --> 55:25.580]  And I have still hiding yet to do it.
[55:25.820 --> 55:28.080]  I have done that before.
[55:28.520 --> 55:29.540]  Just get bored.
[55:29.820 --> 55:30.520]  No, she caught me.
[55:31.620 --> 55:33.260]  But like, yeah, it's impossible.
[55:33.380 --> 55:34.680]  She just doesn't she doesn't poop.
[55:34.880 --> 55:35.840]  I don't know what it does.
[55:35.900 --> 55:39.880]  I don't know if it's like, you know, like a chicken excretes like 90 percent of its waste
[55:39.880 --> 55:40.680]  through its skin.
[55:40.860 --> 55:44.360]  Maybe she's like part chicken and she's like sweating the poop out.
[55:44.660 --> 55:45.460]  That's what they say, right?
[55:45.760 --> 55:48.940]  Like chickens like excrete a lot of their waste through their skin.
[55:49.220 --> 55:52.100]  So when you pick up a chicken, you're just touching a load of shit?
[55:52.260 --> 55:57.400]  Or more likely the flavor in the chicken skin and is poop flavor.
[55:57.660 --> 55:59.800]  But yeah, could be a sloth situation.
[56:00.100 --> 56:01.620]  They shit like once a week, right?
[56:02.500 --> 56:03.220]  Isn't that their thing?
[56:03.720 --> 56:05.600]  How do chickens excrete waste?
[56:05.960 --> 56:08.380]  Chickens mix all their excreted waste products with undigested food.
[56:08.380 --> 56:11.600]  So their feces and urine are combined and pass on a single motion.
[56:11.720 --> 56:13.180]  They have no need for urethra since they don't urinate.
[56:13.300 --> 56:15.680]  Instead, they coat their feces with a regular bird anus.
[56:15.700 --> 56:19.480]  I swear I read that or I knew that.
[56:19.620 --> 56:21.720]  Or maybe it's something I was wrong about my whole life.
[56:22.720 --> 56:27.040]  I mean, when you think about the concept that birds shit through their skin,
[56:27.380 --> 56:28.860]  chickens shit through their skin is outrageous.
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.760]  The idea of the entire skin being linked to the intestines like the neck, the top of the head.
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.000]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.440]  It's a popular misconception.
[56:39.100 --> 56:41.520]  Chickens do not urinate through their skin.
[56:41.680 --> 56:43.160]  In fact, they don't sweat either.
[56:43.380 --> 56:44.160]  They don't have sweat glands.
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.200]  It's the byproduct of protein metabolism in mammals is urea,
[56:48.420 --> 56:49.840]  which is water soluble and released.
[56:49.960 --> 56:50.700]  Yeah, okay, that's interesting.
[56:50.920 --> 56:51.780]  I love those misconceptions.
[56:52.100 --> 56:55.460]  There's that one in Goldfinger, the third Bond movie,
[56:55.600 --> 56:59.240]  where Goldfinger kills a woman by painting her gold.
[56:59.560 --> 57:02.780]  And all the people are like, yeah, the skin suffocated.
[57:03.320 --> 57:04.760]  She couldn't breathe.
[57:04.760 --> 57:08.180]  They usually leave a patch of skin empty so that you can breathe.
[57:08.900 --> 57:10.540]  Turns out, nope, you just breathe through your lungs.
[57:10.900 --> 57:11.460]  Just the lungs.
[57:12.580 --> 57:14.120]  Skin's actually not involved at all.
[57:14.520 --> 57:16.660]  But it's like a common misconception at the time.
[57:17.020 --> 57:18.860]  Yeah, I just, my mind is blown.
[57:19.600 --> 57:26.280]  I've been misinforming the world about chicken excretion for maybe 20 years now.
[57:26.400 --> 57:28.520]  You should probably call everyone who you told that to.
[57:28.540 --> 57:29.540]  Everybody I've ever told that to.
[57:29.580 --> 57:30.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.880]  It would be like you with the license.
[57:33.420 --> 57:34.300]  I've told you a lie.
[57:35.160 --> 57:36.440]  Like 10 years have passed.
[57:36.560 --> 57:37.140]  You're calling someone.
[57:37.400 --> 57:38.400]  I lied to you about something.
[57:39.500 --> 57:41.300]  Oh, man, that's really funny that I did that.
[57:41.360 --> 57:42.160]  I didn't remember doing that.
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.380]  But that's very... yeah.
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.880]  I appreciate you're patting yourself on the back now.
[57:46.000 --> 57:46.700]  I totally am.
[57:46.740 --> 57:48.100]  It seems like something I would totally do.
[57:49.620 --> 57:51.920]  You know, yeah, boy, did you do it?
[57:52.160 --> 57:52.380]  Yeah.
[57:52.680 --> 57:53.100]  All right.
[57:53.100 --> 57:54.280]  So we're at the end.
[57:54.640 --> 57:58.000]  We can't end, obviously, until the next court date is given.
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.680]  But once Eric's given us that, we'll do the outro.
[58:01.080 --> 58:01.500]  For what?
[58:01.760 --> 58:03.320]  What's the court date for?
[58:03.320 --> 58:06.860]  Yeah, Eric, we're going to we're going to need you to tell us what the judge determines
[58:06.860 --> 58:08.020]  at some point.
[58:08.820 --> 58:12.820]  And if we hopefully the judge will declare a mistrial and we'll go forward.
[58:12.820 --> 58:15.380]  Wait, you want the judge to declare a mistrial?
[58:15.700 --> 58:16.120]  I don't know.
[58:17.120 --> 58:20.120]  Present the evidence for the judge to present a mistrial,
[58:20.200 --> 58:22.520]  as I believe the thing he is pitching.
[58:22.660 --> 58:25.260]  Yes, that seems just disrespectful to my evidence.
[58:25.460 --> 58:28.020]  Well, I mean, earlier you just did court into an empty room.
[58:28.020 --> 58:29.180]  So anything's possible.
[58:29.340 --> 58:29.980]  Nick was there.
[58:29.980 --> 58:35.620]  I will say having Nick be your only witness as a not audible person is not not useful.
[58:36.020 --> 58:38.700]  It's like bringing a mime in as like your only witness.
[58:38.820 --> 58:39.460]  It's unfortunate.
[58:40.140 --> 58:44.000]  Nick, who has never said a single word on this podcast, but has been listening to all of them.
[58:44.260 --> 58:44.500]  Yes.
[58:44.920 --> 58:53.340]  Our next court case will be there's not there's not Thursday, the 17th from 3 to 4 p.m.
[58:53.780 --> 58:54.620]  OK, all right.
[58:54.680 --> 58:55.900]  I'm going to write that down in a diary.
[58:56.740 --> 58:57.700]  Central time.
[58:58.260 --> 58:59.140]  Central time.
[58:59.140 --> 59:00.640]  Let me make sure I'm going to check right now.
[59:00.720 --> 59:01.380]  Make sure I can make it.
[59:01.480 --> 59:01.820]  I can.
[59:02.120 --> 59:02.980]  OK, yeah, I can.
[59:03.040 --> 59:04.520]  I mean, it's on it's on your calendar.
[59:05.360 --> 59:06.940]  By the way, we'll do it for fun.
[59:07.040 --> 59:11.880]  I cannot make the Thursday, September 24th recording of F*** Faced
[59:11.880 --> 59:16.160]  because I have a root canal at the exact same time.
[59:17.020 --> 59:21.720]  So we'll have to reschedule that one because the root canal man only works on Thursdays.
[59:22.060 --> 59:24.100]  It's a good thing we didn't have a court case on that day.
[59:24.300 --> 59:25.400]  That would have been unfortunate.
[59:25.580 --> 59:29.060]  I'm telling you, don't don't schedule a court case for Thursday, the 24th.
[59:29.060 --> 59:30.640]  There are no court cases left to schedule.
[59:30.820 --> 59:33.120]  Well, if you don't show up, I guess you'll forfeit.
[59:33.540 --> 59:35.200]  I'll be there, but it's not a court case.
[59:35.340 --> 59:37.780]  I am indeed available on the 17th at three.
[59:37.880 --> 59:40.220]  I'm going to accept that calendar invite right now.
[59:40.360 --> 59:41.460]  How are your times going, Gavin?
[59:41.720 --> 59:42.300]  You beat me yet?
[59:43.360 --> 59:44.460]  You know, who knows?
[59:44.920 --> 59:45.140]  Who knows?
[59:45.380 --> 59:46.100]  OK, sure.
[59:46.440 --> 59:47.020]  I'm just asking.
[59:47.480 --> 59:48.860]  I'm not going to tell you straight away.
[59:49.620 --> 59:53.520]  I'm going to wait until you have until I know you have something to do.
[59:53.560 --> 59:56.460]  Like you move or you have some sort of appointment.
[59:56.580 --> 59:57.840]  I'm going to tell you right before that.
[59:57.840 --> 59:59.680]  I'm going to really eat into your 12 hours.
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.680]  If we're going to play dirty or expect dirty.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.820]  I'm the only one playing clean.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.640]  I don't know what you mean.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.020]  If you're going to wait for Andrew to have something to do,
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.120]  you're going to be waiting for a while.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:09.800]  Boom!
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.400]  Yeah.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.420]  Yeah, because I do nothing.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.120]  There you go.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.320]  Also, who's Ian?
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.460]  What's going on?
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.680]  Do you want to talk about that?
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.960]  I don't know if we have time for that.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:17.600]  That's the thing.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.140]  Of course we don't.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.300]  I've spent two weeks of Ian tweets.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.740]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.600]  Yeah, it's annoying.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.680]  Is it a lot?
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.760]  Should we get into it next episode?
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.920]  It's not a lot, but it's a thing.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.160]  That's not for this episode.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320]  It's also not for next episode because we got caught.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.420]  But maybe the one after that.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.020]  No, we don't have any court.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.200]  We're fine.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.360]  Sorry to interrupt the outro.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:36.920]  Just really quick.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.440]  I just want to just drop this in real quick.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.260]  Just, you know, I just thought this was interesting.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.460]  I need medicine.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.360]  So I'm just going to put that there.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:43.860]  Just so you know.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:44.720]  Okay.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.220]  Sorry, Geoff.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:45.600]  Continue.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.200]  You can wrap it up.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.320]  I didn't do much.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.000]  I didn't play much.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.540]  Oh, that's out.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.560]  That's outskirts.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.180]  Yeah.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.060]  I see you sneaky fuck.
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.640]  It looks like Andrew played a video game.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.180]  Congratulations.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:55.940]  No, no.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:01.160]  It looks like Andrew found one of the levels that I'd beaten him at.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.460]  And hadn't told him about.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.180]  And he went and beat it.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:04.960]  Yeah.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.300]  Oh, wait, another one?
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.920]  No, it's just a better view.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.300]  It's a more clear view of that.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:09.620]  Yeah.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.240]  Okay.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.020]  I see you.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.660]  Let me ask you this.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.420]  Do you think that's the only one?
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.040]  I have a better time.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.320]  No, I beat the other one too, dummy.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.580]  I know you did too.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:18.780]  Wait, what?
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.300]  Did you really?
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.760]  Yeah, I beat both of them.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.200]  Balls in your court, dude.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.360]  Ooh.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.920]  Tune in next week on F*** Face for the thrilling conclusion and the court battle
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.160]  to determine will or won't Andrew eat the pencil.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.300]  I have been Geoff Ramsey.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.280]  As with me always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.600]  Hey, if you like this podcast, why don't you go ahead and like and give us a good review.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.820]  Give us a five star rating.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.380]  If it lets you give six, do that too.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.020]  Unless it's like six out of a hundred.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.660]  Don't tank us that hard, buddy.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.560]  Buy the shirt.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.580]  Yeah, buy the shirt.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.880]  We've got the Russian Red Maga F*** Face Hat Shirt is available.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.900]  Unbranded that way, but okay.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.000]  We've already sold a few of them.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.400]  Thank you to the early adopters who had to finger on the buy button the second it went live.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:15.340]  You too can get your very own Red Russian F*** Face Hat Shirt.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.540]  Or the F word shirt, as it's called.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.820]  Or the F word shirt.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.620]  And yeah.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:31.980]  And if you are equally as horrified by Andrew Panton and his just chicanery, let us know.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.020]  See you next week.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:34.900]  Bye.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.460]  Well, what a bulls**t.
