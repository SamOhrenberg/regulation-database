[00:30.180 --> 00:35.900]  Hey, it's Andrew. We recorded these episodes two weeks in advance, but with the response
[00:35.900 --> 00:41.520]  of the trial episode, I wanted to record a quick thing today that acknowledged some of it. I wrote
[00:41.520 --> 00:46.600]  this down to be concise, but I mainly just wanted to say that your feedback, regardless of if it's
[00:46.600 --> 00:50.720]  positive or negative, is heard. Whether you enjoyed the previous episode or not,
[00:51.200 --> 00:54.780]  I want to thank you so much for listening and for caring so much about this show.
[00:55.340 --> 00:59.380]  Nobody would leave feedback on a thing they weren't passionate about, and I love your enthusiasm.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.640]  It honestly blows my mind that anyone actually listens to this, but your support of the show
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.400]  truly means the world to me. Unfortunately, the trial bit didn't land for a lot of you.
[01:09.860 --> 01:14.280]  Not everything can be as glorious as a fuckhead, but please know that everything I do on this show
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.120]  is done with the hope of making you laugh. I certainly won't always be successful,
[01:18.340 --> 01:23.680]  but I'm always trying. I should wrap this up so we can return to our normal ridiculous podcast.
[01:23.800 --> 01:27.220]  I'm sure Gavin shit himself. Not Gavin. Why did I say Gavin shit himself? Well,
[01:27.220 --> 01:30.680]  he did shit himself. I'm going right off the rails. I apologize. Anyway,
[01:31.160 --> 01:34.940]  once again, thank you so much for supporting the show. I hope you enjoy this episode.
[01:35.460 --> 01:38.320]  Have a wonderful day. Be kind to each other. Thank you.
[02:06.470 --> 02:14.270]  On time is better than being early. Yes. Yeah. And you think being early is worse than being late?
[02:14.670 --> 02:21.430]  No, no, no. Being late is the worst. Then being early is, uh, it's fine, but not ideal. Being
[02:21.430 --> 02:27.270]  bang on time, that's perfection. But why, what do you have against being early? Because you,
[02:27.350 --> 02:31.850]  you sounded like vociferously against it for a second there. Well, it's just like people are
[02:31.850 --> 02:37.410]  sort of, you know, if you're in here at two 57, you sort of, you sort of think that, you know,
[02:37.450 --> 02:42.310]  you got some time, like Eric thought he had some time. Right. That's based on every other episode.
[02:42.450 --> 02:47.630]  That's based on every other episode we've ever done where you're here on the dot at three. No,
[02:47.670 --> 02:51.410]  it's like when you make plans with someone, you plan to meet them somewhere and you're, and you
[02:51.410 --> 02:57.950]  know, I'm on track to get there exactly at two or whatever. They text me at one 54, like, Hey,
[02:57.950 --> 03:03.330]  I'm here now. I'm feeling stressed. Why are you feeling stressed? Because now they're waiting on
[03:03.330 --> 03:08.070]  their own. And I'm, I'm thinking like, man, I should have left earlier. Why? But that's of
[03:08.070 --> 03:13.030]  their accord. Yeah, that's, this is insane. Yeah. That's not on you. That's six minutes.
[03:13.150 --> 03:18.050]  Isn't it? It's not on you. It's not incumbent upon you. They did that to themselves. Okay. Well,
[03:18.050 --> 03:24.390]  what if they were meeting at your place? Uh, Hey, come to mine at noon. They're there at 1152. And
[03:24.390 --> 03:29.850]  I'm like, Oh damn, I'm barely dressed. Wait, you're no, I think that's totally fine. Yeah.
[03:29.870 --> 03:36.430]  That's totally fine. I would say within like 15 minutes early. 15 minutes early. Dude. If, if,
[03:36.650 --> 03:41.870]  okay. If you're meeting at my place, be there at the time. Like, don't be there early because I'm
[03:41.870 --> 03:47.690]  not ready. I've budgeted for all of those minutes to, to, you know, get my shit together. If you're
[03:47.690 --> 03:52.950]  here, then I'm rushing. My hair's wet. I'm putting on a t-shirt. It's going to get wet. My chest
[03:52.950 --> 03:58.350]  seeping into all the fabric. Okay. But you're making this all about you. What if it's just
[03:58.350 --> 04:04.870]  like, like for instance, for me, uh, and I I'll recognize that I am, uh, quite probably
[04:05.790 --> 04:10.530]  institutionalized from my five years of service in the United States military, where if you were
[04:10.530 --> 04:15.270]  on time, you were late in the army. You get in trouble for being on time. You have to be
[04:15.270 --> 04:20.690]  everywhere 15 minutes early because that's preparation, right? So even to this day,
[04:20.690 --> 04:25.770]  even though, you know, I got out of the army at 23, here I am 45, I still get places early.
[04:25.930 --> 04:29.570]  If I get to your house, Gav, and you're still, you've got wet chest hair or whatever,
[04:29.710 --> 04:35.430]  because you took a shower, uh, because you, you budgeted your time in such a way that you get
[04:35.430 --> 04:42.030]  ready the second I'm supposed to arrive, like all things in the universe converge in that one
[04:42.030 --> 04:47.990]  moment in time, which is, I gotta say, impressive, uh, from a micromanaging standpoint and more power
[04:47.990 --> 04:53.630]  to you. But I would prefer to leave early, get there early, and then sit in my car and listen to
[04:54.130 --> 04:59.950]  a podcast or the news for five minutes just so I don't have the stress of worrying about getting
[04:59.950 --> 05:04.250]  to your place late. And I don't expect you to open the door early. I'm happy just to sit in my
[05:04.250 --> 05:09.290]  car and count the, count the minutes until it's, until the agreed upon time. I can see that. My,
[05:09.290 --> 05:13.550]  my issue comes mainly from keeping people waiting. I never want to be like, I want to be on time,
[05:13.550 --> 05:19.110]  but if someone else is early, then I feel like I'm keeping them waiting. And that's, that's like,
[05:19.110 --> 05:23.510]  why don't you go earlier? Why are you always trying to hit the dot? If you're worried about
[05:23.510 --> 05:27.430]  people being early, why don't you just start showing up to things early and then they're
[05:27.430 --> 05:31.690]  never waiting? Cause a lot of time, there's not enough time to be early. If you're coming straight
[05:31.690 --> 05:37.810]  off other stuff, if you're back to backing, uh, you know, your appointments. No, I'm that's,
[05:37.870 --> 05:41.930]  I'm not saying within a work context. I'm saying like, if you're going to meet somebody for lunch,
[05:41.930 --> 05:47.010]  why don't you just be early instead of being worried about them being early than you.
[05:47.330 --> 05:51.870]  Ah, now then you see you're dealing with people who are late. You don't know what other people
[05:51.870 --> 05:57.350]  are going to do. For example, uh, you know, some people at this company, if you say meet me at
[05:57.350 --> 06:04.090]  eight, I'll show up exactly at eight. They might show up at eight 40. And then if I was 20 minutes
[06:04.090 --> 06:06.790]  early, I would have been waiting an hour. Can I ask you a question about that?
[06:07.030 --> 06:07.310]  Yes.
[06:07.310 --> 06:12.370]  You said some people like you mean certain people. Would you like to tell us who those people are?
[06:12.970 --> 06:14.430]  It's okay. You're in a safe place.
[06:14.630 --> 06:17.150]  Should we speak ill of those who don't work with us anymore?
[06:17.750 --> 06:18.830]  Uh, yeah, of course.
[06:18.950 --> 06:26.150]  Um, Mr. Ezra Cooperstein would often show up almost a full hour late to the point where I was
[06:26.150 --> 06:32.970]  like, uh, did we go to dinner? Did we have dinner Ezra? Or was I sat here completely on my own
[06:32.970 --> 06:38.230]  with people gulping at me? Uh, you know, wondering if I got stood up.
[06:38.410 --> 06:45.490]  Dude. I one time had dinner with that man in San Francisco at seven o'clock at eight o'clock. He
[06:45.490 --> 06:51.690]  still hadn't shown up. He texts, you know, running a bit late at nine o'clock. He rolls in after
[06:51.690 --> 06:56.330]  literally I've been sitting at a, at a, at a, like a sushi restaurant for two hours with a group of
[06:56.330 --> 07:00.430]  people, but it wasn't just me, but he walks in at nine o'clock. He looks at me and he goes,
[07:00.430 --> 07:06.610]  we said nine o'clock, right? And he just smiled at me and I went, you're the boss. I guess we said
[07:06.610 --> 07:15.370]  nine. That was it. That's insanity. Two hours. Well, not to busy people. I had a great time
[07:15.370 --> 07:20.130]  working with Ezra. I did not have a great time, uh, doing social events with him outside of a
[07:20.130 --> 07:23.770]  work environment. It's funny to me that I did not think it was going to be Ezra. I thought
[07:23.770 --> 07:28.710]  you were going to complain about like, I don't know, Jeremy or Barbara or Blaine or somebody.
[07:28.710 --> 07:33.890]  You went, you went high up. I went, I went right, right to the top. You went to the sea level.
[07:34.110 --> 07:40.410]  All right. The problem in that context though, is when you're doing a group thing, like one-on-one,
[07:40.490 --> 07:44.750]  you can account for that at least. But if there are multiple people, then you are then obligated
[07:44.750 --> 07:49.770]  to show up at the time. The minute it becomes like a group dinner, you're fucked. One-on-one
[07:49.770 --> 07:53.790]  though, you can adjust for that. If he's always an hour late, that's easy to deal with. Just always
[07:53.790 --> 07:59.510]  be late. Yeah. You have to waste your own time learning that about people. No, that's true.
[07:59.910 --> 08:04.830]  It's a good point. God, I got to say the weirdest thing about this to me is, and I can feel it
[08:04.830 --> 08:10.910]  happening and I don't know why, but for now, for something about this conversation, for the rest of
[08:10.910 --> 08:17.290]  my life now, I'm going to think that every time I'm to meet Gavin somewhere, he is one second
[08:17.290 --> 08:23.090]  out of the shower. I know it's not true. I know it's not true. But now for the rest of my mind,
[08:23.090 --> 08:29.130]  something just cemented, two pieces of brain just got superglued together, that now I think that
[08:29.130 --> 08:35.710]  Gavin takes a shower before every appointment or meeting he has. I'll be honest, if I leave the
[08:35.710 --> 08:44.250]  house, usually the last thing I'll do before leaving is have a shower. That's fair. To what,
[08:44.390 --> 08:47.710]  like once, right? Like if you leave in the morning and then leave in the evening, you're not
[08:47.710 --> 08:53.190]  done with showers. No. So one shower. Okay. That's fine. I'll just time it to the point
[08:53.190 --> 08:57.430]  where it's like, if you have to interact with me, I'll be clean. What's fascinating to me about this
[08:57.430 --> 09:03.510]  is if I, if you invited me to go to your house, Gavin, I absolutely would be there 10 minutes
[09:03.510 --> 09:08.850]  early. And I would have never, it wouldn't have even crossed my mind that that would be in any
[09:08.850 --> 09:13.630]  way an inconvenience to you. This has completely changed my perception. I'll tell you the secret.
[09:13.630 --> 09:18.530]  I'm always, okay. Aside from like, uh, when I'm late from like a recording,
[09:18.710 --> 09:22.650]  like two, two, two recordings, like coming back to back, I'll be like late to the podcast or
[09:22.650 --> 09:28.630]  whatever. Aside from that, I'm usually pretty bang on time. And the way I do that is that I'll get
[09:28.630 --> 09:34.650]  somewhere, you know, five to 10 minutes early and just like hide around the corner. This is insane.
[09:35.090 --> 09:42.730]  This is, this is insane. Until like 2.59 and then I'll just stroll around as if I'm completely on
[09:42.730 --> 09:48.050]  time just that way. I've not put any pressure on anyone else. And I'm not late in the slightest.
[09:48.250 --> 09:54.130]  Well, how is that insane, Eric? That's, you just said what you just, you're the person that you
[09:54.130 --> 10:01.390]  said that you didn't want to do that to someone else, but you're happily the person that is doing
[10:01.390 --> 10:07.050]  that. It's the most tone deaf thing I've ever heard. You came out and literally started this off
[10:07.590 --> 10:11.650]  with saying, this is what I hate about people when they do this. And I said, oh,
[10:11.650 --> 10:16.610]  I do this opposite thing this way. And you go, yeah, I hate that. Also. I do that exact same
[10:16.610 --> 10:21.050]  thing. Apparently. I'm not visible. I'm not present. You don't know that I'm there waiting.
[10:21.330 --> 10:26.550]  I will just know that I'm not there. I don't wear a beacon. I don't like roll up with a Geoff
[10:26.550 --> 10:31.190]  signal and fucking flash it. Like I'm like commissioner Gordon needs help. Aren't you
[10:31.190 --> 10:36.310]  making the PR you're now being late. Like what if the person's there and you're waiting to be on
[10:36.310 --> 10:42.790]  time? You're in a sense, you're late. You can already be with them. No, if we're meeting at
[10:42.790 --> 10:48.110]  a restaurant or something, uh, or like a meeting at their place, I'll be there on time. But if
[10:48.110 --> 10:52.070]  they're, if they're like ready to go, then I'll come out early, but I will never make scoping
[10:52.070 --> 10:55.930]  out. Like what is the process? What do you mean? You'll be like, will you be there five? You'll
[10:55.930 --> 11:00.010]  see if they're there. And then if they're not, you'll walk away. What are the rules? I just,
[11:00.530 --> 11:05.950]  the rules are, I don't want to be visibly early to make people freak out and hurry up.
[11:05.950 --> 11:09.850]  And I don't want to be late. That's the only way to do it. If you could think of a better way
[11:09.850 --> 11:16.170]  to always be, you know, on time to the minute. Oh, because then I'm sort of stood outside their
[11:16.170 --> 11:27.490]  front door while they're in my mind, they've just hopped out of the shower face episode 18.
[11:27.590 --> 11:34.450]  How's it going? Everyone? I can't, I would, I would die if I were you. There's like 50 rules
[11:34.450 --> 11:39.250]  for just showing up to a thing. You're going to worry yourself to an early grave like this, buddy.
[11:39.670 --> 11:44.630]  You can't even get over thinking. It makes it weird. It's not even like an anxiety thing to
[11:44.630 --> 11:49.990]  him. Being late is disrespectful. Being early is inconvenient. There's only one way to be,
[11:50.090 --> 11:55.310]  and that is on time. There's a line in the sand. It's like when you open a door for someone and
[11:55.310 --> 11:58.650]  you hold it, there's like, you have to do a measurement of how close they are to you,
[11:58.690 --> 12:02.110]  to the door. If they're too far away, it becomes an inconvenience. You just,
[12:02.110 --> 12:05.630]  there has to be a measurement. There's a line between early and not too early.
[12:06.050 --> 12:10.810]  Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'm just, I just haven't figured out the correct timings yet.
[12:11.170 --> 12:15.150]  If you get somewhere a little early and you need to hide, do you bring disguises?
[12:16.270 --> 12:21.690]  Do you ever roll with like a trench coat and a hat? Just in case they spot you?
[12:23.490 --> 12:28.030]  No, I usually decide if there's a place, like a parking place, I'll just go over there for a bit
[12:28.030 --> 12:32.290]  as if I've just parked a car that I don't know how to drive, and I'm just walking up.
[12:34.210 --> 12:37.390]  You made me all self-conscious about this. I thought this was like a fine thing.
[12:37.610 --> 12:41.610]  The only person getting hurt is myself. I didn't think it was that big a deal.
[12:42.090 --> 12:45.790]  It's just very weird. I mean, no one is getting hurt, but you. It's just very bizarre.
[12:45.990 --> 12:51.770]  It's just, your brain is hurt in a way, and it just shows me every once in a while,
[12:51.790 --> 12:57.030]  and I get surprised by it. I don't know what, like if you fell, or like how something got
[12:57.030 --> 13:02.730]  twisted. Do you remember when you were a kid, and you fell and smacked your, like you fell
[13:02.730 --> 13:08.050]  off the front step and smacked your nose? Yeah. And like it's been, I guess it crookeded it?
[13:08.250 --> 13:11.390]  Yeah, that wasn't as bad as when I fell in the back of my head and went blind.
[13:11.570 --> 13:14.290]  Oh, when you fell in the back, maybe that was it. When you fell in the back of your head and
[13:14.290 --> 13:18.710]  you went blind. Do you think something, like something also got crossed that day
[13:18.710 --> 13:26.030]  that makes you weird? I think about that probably weekly. Like, is that, was that one event,
[13:26.030 --> 13:30.510]  like everything? Sure. If I could go back and undo that event, where would I be now?
[13:30.870 --> 13:35.850]  Like, not to talk about other, or to promote other podcasts and radio shows, obviously,
[13:36.330 --> 13:40.790]  but Gavin, you, and Andrew, I think you listened for a while too, we're all familiar with Sour
[13:40.790 --> 13:46.350]  Shoes, who's a guy who calls into the Howard Stern Show, and he has a photographic memory of every
[13:46.350 --> 13:52.250]  song ever made, or that he's ever heard, and he can play it on a keyboard from start to finish,
[13:52.250 --> 13:57.590]  having only heard it once. It's like a super, superhuman ability, but he also wears a diaper
[13:57.590 --> 14:02.190]  and lives with his parents because he's, he's got the mind of a child, and he's in his 40s or 30s.
[14:02.330 --> 14:07.070]  However, he was a normal dude until he was a baseball player in high school, and he got hit
[14:07.070 --> 14:11.170]  in the fucking head with a baseball, and he came out the other end that guy. Dude,
[14:11.290 --> 14:15.530]  the head is important. You gotta look after your, your old bumps. Yeah, you like, he,
[14:15.730 --> 14:20.990]  he now has the ability to remember every song ever made, but he shits in a diaper. So it's like,
[14:20.990 --> 14:25.630]  I wonder. Sounds like a fair trade. Yeah, I totally agree, by the way. I would take the talent for,
[14:25.730 --> 14:31.630]  for the pooping. But, uh, I just, like, it's just wonder, like, I, how many, like,
[14:31.690 --> 14:35.970]  how different would your life be if you had not had those two falls? Or whatever the fall is,
[14:36.010 --> 14:41.310]  or the catastrophe that happened to you that broke you in the way that you're broken?
[14:41.810 --> 14:47.310]  We'll never know. It's a shame. Hey, who are you? Uh, I'm Geoff. I was gonna say, actually,
[14:47.310 --> 14:53.150]  I thought this was episode 16. And then I looked and it's not you said it's 18. I've now realized
[14:53.150 --> 14:56.990]  much like, uh, I'll never think of you not showering before every appointment. I think
[14:56.990 --> 15:02.910]  every episode of this is 16 for some reason. Yeah, I think last, did you say last week,
[15:02.970 --> 15:08.170]  you named it 15? I think you, I think your naming scheme is what's your local naming scheme is
[15:08.170 --> 15:12.450]  screwing you a little bit. I, yeah, I just am gonna name them all 16. Now, I think I feel like
[15:12.450 --> 15:17.730]  the internet is ablaze since the last one came out. The, the, the, the trial, well, the trial
[15:17.730 --> 15:22.530]  hasn't come out yet, but the, uh, the pre-trial came out and I feel like the comments are just
[15:23.090 --> 15:29.870]  on fire. Andrew, what are your thoughts? I think it went over very well. I think people, uh,
[15:29.870 --> 15:35.470]  very much, uh, enjoying, enjoying the way, uh, it's gone. I don't think there've been any issues
[15:35.470 --> 15:39.910]  or complaints or, or, uh, calling me a coward. I'm starting to feel worried because usually like
[15:39.910 --> 15:46.230]  Geoff and I, we're in videos constantly, uh, years and decades of comments, but you, Andrew,
[15:46.330 --> 15:51.650]  sort of, uh, have been typically background in terms of your interaction with the audience.
[15:51.890 --> 15:55.310]  You know, there's, there's a lot of people who know you, who you are, but it's not like a daily
[15:55.310 --> 16:01.590]  barrage of comments. And, uh, it, I feel like the comments went from Andrew is the funniest person
[16:01.590 --> 16:06.090]  I've ever heard in my life. Where have you been keeping him this entire time to Andrew is a little
[16:06.090 --> 16:12.130]  bitch. Why doesn't he just eat the pencil? What a cowardly little bitch. I hate Andrew. I can't
[16:12.130 --> 16:20.530]  believe get him out of here. That bum. I think the psychology is interesting because the concept
[16:20.530 --> 16:27.790]  that like me pretending, I didn't agree to have a pencil is the worst thing ever. But Geoff saying
[16:27.790 --> 16:33.250]  that I have an obsessive piss fetish and that I'm watching homeless ladies pee is a lie. That is
[16:33.250 --> 16:39.150]  totally acceptable. No issues there at all. No problem. It's by the way, not a lie. That's based
[16:39.150 --> 16:44.970]  on stories you told us. I said one story where I saw a woman pee and I didn't want to see it.
[16:45.210 --> 16:49.630]  It wasn't what I was hoping for. I didn't seek it, but it happened. Can I ask you a question? Yeah,
[16:49.670 --> 16:54.530]  go ahead. You, that happened. You looked out your window, you saw it right at that moment. Have you
[16:54.530 --> 16:58.970]  looked out your window at that spot since? What do you, well, that's an absurd question. Yeah,
[16:58.970 --> 17:04.970]  I've looked out the window. It's a window. Because despite your, your fucking willingness
[17:04.970 --> 17:10.650]  not to be a weirdo. I've looked out the window for 20 years before. Yeah, waiting to see the pee and
[17:10.650 --> 17:14.730]  then you saw it and now your eyes get brought right back to that same spot. Just hoping against
[17:14.730 --> 17:19.310]  hope that maybe one day it'll happen again. Are you disappointed now when you look out the window
[17:19.310 --> 17:23.830]  and there's nothing happening out there? My whole point was that I don't do this. How did this flip
[17:23.830 --> 17:27.870]  into am I disappointed that I don't see it? Because we're getting to the truth here. Here's
[17:27.870 --> 17:32.270]  the thing. Oh, just like I was trying to get to the truth, but that's a big fucking problem. You
[17:32.270 --> 17:38.270]  say that I made it up like a lie. But Andrew, if you were really horrified and didn't like what you
[17:38.270 --> 17:44.710]  saw, you would have bricked in the window. You would have been horrified by seeing homeless
[17:44.710 --> 17:48.190]  ladies. But the fact that you didn't brick in your window and you continue to look out that
[17:48.190 --> 17:53.490]  window tells me you are obsessed with urine. Very telling. You ever bricked in a window ever?
[17:55.070 --> 18:00.110]  Listen, I'm not legally allowed to say about certain things. Okay. I wouldn't even know
[18:00.110 --> 18:05.470]  how to... where do I go to brick a window? Well, I'd go to Home Depot. Well, the brick store. Yeah,
[18:05.550 --> 18:09.770]  I was gonna say, where's the brick store? Home Depot, you buy some bricks and some spackle. I mean,
[18:09.790 --> 18:13.710]  you can make a brick. Wait, I need spackle? You can make a brick. You can make your own spackle.
[18:13.910 --> 18:19.050]  Find some clay, you know, get it wet, make it brick-like, put it in the oven. He's got a point.
[18:19.050 --> 18:25.430]  What is a brick? Like, how do I make a brick? It's heated up clay. What is clay though? It's
[18:26.830 --> 18:31.790]  like super mud. It's everywhere in the world except every biome I use in Minecraft.
[18:32.930 --> 18:38.030]  Do you ever just look at like... like I was looking at a KitKat recently and realized I have
[18:38.030 --> 18:44.350]  no idea what a wafer is. Like, I don't even know where to begin. What a wafer is? Like, if someone
[18:44.790 --> 18:50.550]  said... if... okay. That is a good point. I know what a wafer is. If you said, Andrew, here's two
[18:50.550 --> 18:55.410]  million dollars, go make a legitimate KitKat. And I'm like, okay, I'm gonna get the ingredients. I
[18:55.410 --> 19:00.130]  had unlimited budget. I can do whatever I needed. I'm like, I need chocolate. I can buy chocolate.
[19:00.550 --> 19:08.170]  What the fuck is a wafer? Is it a rice thing? Do I need flour? Do I cook? Do I put it in an oven?
[19:08.170 --> 19:12.510]  I'll be honest. You've blown my mind. Where does a wafer come from?
[19:12.810 --> 19:19.050]  Andrew, I was all in to make fun of you, but you won me over instantly. I got no idea.
[19:19.390 --> 19:21.790]  I have no clue how to make a wafer or what I know what it tastes like.
[19:21.810 --> 19:24.210]  Why don't we go around the group? Geoff, how do you make wafer?
[19:24.570 --> 19:27.850]  I think you would bake it? You bake it?
[19:27.850 --> 19:32.530]  You keep saying it, though. You gotta have it to bake it.
[19:32.690 --> 19:37.430]  I think it's like rice based, maybe? Like rice paper? I don't know.
[19:37.430 --> 19:44.190]  Yeah, exactly. It's a fucking mystery. I just had a nutter butter or a nutty buddy
[19:44.190 --> 19:47.090]  and it's all wafer and chocolate. I don't know what I ate.
[19:47.290 --> 19:52.490]  It's got to be like one degree from a biscuit or a cookie, but like flatter.
[19:52.730 --> 19:56.750]  But it's the texture is different, though. It is. It is. It's like maybe you've got to
[19:56.750 --> 20:02.530]  like crush it. It's almost like precise. Like, you know, what is that dessert you get
[20:02.530 --> 20:08.950]  when you eat at like shawarma places? Baclava? Baclava is the thing you wear on your head.
[20:09.210 --> 20:12.290]  No, not balaclava. Baclava? Yeah, baclava, right?
[20:12.430 --> 20:17.610]  It's like it's like it's like weight. It's like layers of of like pastry on top of each other,
[20:17.690 --> 20:21.990]  like over and over again. It's like a precise version of like a scientific version.
[20:24.150 --> 20:28.550]  I didn't hear a single thing you said because I'm obsessed with the idea that you thought
[20:28.550 --> 20:35.370]  we're suggesting a thing to put on your head like that. We need a clarification. You're like,
[20:35.430 --> 20:40.530]  no, not baclava. It's a head thing. And then you circle back and just say, yeah, it is.
[20:40.650 --> 20:46.050]  They always confuse me. Two people show up to rob a bank. One of them's just got a bunch of
[20:46.050 --> 20:50.790]  Kit Kat sellotape around his head. Those are words that get to me.
[20:51.070 --> 20:54.630]  I've never seen a wafer in the wild is what is the real puzzle to me.
[20:54.770 --> 20:57.090]  Are you expecting it to grow on like a wafer shrub?
[20:57.090 --> 21:03.410]  No, I'm saying like if I'm at a there's a plate of treats, right? Like an assortment of desserts.
[21:03.550 --> 21:07.690]  I'm never like, oh, that's a wafer. You don't see it. It's always with something else. It's
[21:07.690 --> 21:10.810]  covered in chocolate. It's just it's just strange. I only really see it.
[21:11.030 --> 21:16.510]  Can we potentially get the face jam guy who's in this recording to do a little bit of wafer
[21:16.510 --> 21:20.070]  research if he has time? Also cheese. That's another one.
[21:20.170 --> 21:23.230]  Cheese. Listen, fuck off. Cheese is milk. It's just.
[21:23.410 --> 21:26.050]  Yeah, but OK, you get the milk. But then how do you make it the cheese?
[21:26.050 --> 21:27.750]  You leave it. You just leave it alone.
[21:27.890 --> 21:32.710]  So I get a cow. I milk the cow. Then I leave the milk and it turns into cheese.
[21:32.930 --> 21:37.390]  I mean, in the right environment. And you can add sort of like different cheese cultures.
[21:38.090 --> 21:40.510]  But I think basically it's. What is a cheese culture?
[21:40.850 --> 21:45.490]  You just leave milk and it turns to cheese. And then you like you like skim off the top.
[21:45.550 --> 21:49.190]  And sometimes that's the cheese. Yeah, you like heat it and you can like
[21:49.190 --> 21:53.730]  stir it. It starts to like glupify. And then you take your curds of cheese.
[21:53.730 --> 21:57.010]  I don't know. I've never made cheese, but it's pretty milky.
[21:57.370 --> 22:01.730]  It's pretty gross, the process. I just watched him make mozzarella on
[22:01.730 --> 22:04.490]  Fuck That's Delicious. And it's a pretty gross process.
[22:04.730 --> 22:07.690]  I just like going to the wafer concept of I need to make this thing.
[22:07.850 --> 22:12.450]  I definitely I'd buy a cow. I'd buy a bucket. And then it's it's we're going.
[22:12.670 --> 22:15.410]  It's crazy from there. I'm just going to be buying stuff, hoping it works.
[22:15.550 --> 22:22.090]  I think you need a you need a cow, a bucket. You need some cheesecloth and a dark, damp room.
[22:22.090 --> 22:24.530]  Do you need heat? Is that part of it? Or am I making that part?
[22:24.750 --> 22:30.230]  Uh, well, it's is the pasteurize that the heat is the pasteurization is like,
[22:30.250 --> 22:34.050]  I don't know what process that's that is introduced into cheese.
[22:34.410 --> 22:36.870]  Do you pasteurize the milk before you make cheese out of it?
[22:36.970 --> 22:39.690]  Or do you not need to? I don't know. I don't know.
[22:39.870 --> 22:43.630]  Oh, I wish I was a farmer. Do I need the thing that you put the
[22:43.630 --> 22:46.790]  milk into and you hit it with the stick in the bucket?
[22:47.050 --> 22:49.310]  That's how they make butter, right? Oh, like a churner?
[22:49.310 --> 22:52.370]  Like a churner. I feel like I need to do some churning if I'm making cheese.
[22:52.610 --> 22:55.190]  There might be some churning for certain types of cheese.
[22:55.410 --> 22:58.750]  But that's butter, though. Yeah, but I feel like you got to churn
[22:58.750 --> 23:01.430]  the milk. You can't just leave the milk. There has to be a churn.
[23:01.690 --> 23:05.050]  I feel like that's the point. That's like the crossroad is you either you take the
[23:05.050 --> 23:08.870]  milk and you churn or you take the milk and you leave and then you've got two different paths.
[23:09.110 --> 23:11.950]  Maybe that's how butter was invented. Someone trying to make cheese.
[23:12.290 --> 23:16.230]  Is butter milk? Butter's milk. Is it not?
[23:16.630 --> 23:19.290]  Hey, Eric, what's a wafer? A wafer is just a very thin
[23:19.290 --> 23:22.510]  cookie or cracker. It's made out of flour. I don't know.
[23:22.670 --> 23:26.570]  Flour! Yeah, it's just a very thin cookie or cracker.
[23:26.690 --> 23:32.770]  How do you make a wafer? You make a very thin cookie or cracker.
[23:32.910 --> 23:36.170]  It just doesn't seem like a thing that a human can do.
[23:36.290 --> 23:39.530]  That's not true. If I make really thin chocolate chip cookies,
[23:39.550 --> 23:43.030]  those aren't fucking wafers. Yeah, I think it's more to it.
[23:43.150 --> 23:46.670]  It's crazy because you asked me and then I told you and then you told me
[23:46.670 --> 23:52.090]  that I was wrong. You don't know what it is you asked me.
[23:52.210 --> 23:57.310]  I know I'm wrong, but I know you're wrong too. We're all equally wrong. I do know that.
[23:57.470 --> 23:59.110]  I have a work question for you, Eric. Yes.
[23:59.210 --> 24:03.170]  Has any of this episode of F*** Face been an episode of F*** Face yet?
[24:04.050 --> 24:08.850]  I think most of it. I don't think any of it is on the cutting room floor. Maybe some of
[24:08.850 --> 24:14.630]  the beginning, but really I think a lot of that is crucial for the weird early visibility thing
[24:14.630 --> 24:18.390]  where you just really came unglued. You really crumbled.
[24:18.710 --> 24:21.470]  You're just a weirdo. I feel like this has been nice though
[24:21.470 --> 24:25.690]  because obviously we were pretty... we were just hammering Andrew for the last two episodes
[24:25.690 --> 24:29.010]  and now the audience is getting him, so I feel like we don't need to as much.
[24:29.430 --> 24:32.550]  But I'm enjoying this sort of pre-trial discussion time.
[24:32.730 --> 24:34.250]  Yeah. It feels like the old days.
[24:34.390 --> 24:40.630]  It does. I kind of... I'm with you, Gav. I feel like nothing we can do to pile on to Andrew is
[24:40.630 --> 24:45.590]  gonna hold a candle to what the audience has already probably been putting him through.
[24:46.030 --> 24:50.110]  By the time the trial comes out, I heard... I don't know if you've listened to any of that
[24:50.110 --> 24:52.010]  episode yet. I listened to like the first five minutes.
[24:53.130 --> 24:54.190]  Yeah, I said it actually.
[24:54.370 --> 24:58.630]  Yeah, he's in for some fun. But I kind of like the fact that we're avoiding it because it's
[24:58.630 --> 25:05.010]  obviously been... even though Andrew said there was no love lost between the three of us and that
[25:05.010 --> 25:09.970]  though he had to work a little bit to find some of that love, I like kind of ignoring it and
[25:09.970 --> 25:16.090]  pretending like we're not in the middle of a really heated three-way argument and just pretending
[25:16.610 --> 25:20.590]  like that's not happening and then enjoying... I have some stories I could tell. Andrew told me
[25:20.590 --> 25:25.170]  he f***ing faced himself. He wants to talk about that. And let's just pretend like the world's
[25:25.170 --> 25:28.390]  greatest trial never has... isn't happening behind the scenes.
[25:28.490 --> 25:33.090]  I'll be honest though, I don't think I've ever wanted him to eat a pencil less since the start
[25:33.090 --> 25:35.190]  of this. It's like, I don't know. I'm not fussed anymore.
[25:35.470 --> 25:36.590]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[25:36.730 --> 25:38.470]  It's just interesting to see how he handled it.
[25:38.470 --> 25:41.730]  Eric says he has a judge's ruling. I handled it very well, in my opinion.
[25:42.110 --> 25:43.310]  I want to know this judge's ruling.
[25:43.570 --> 25:44.490]  You want to go straight to it?
[25:44.650 --> 25:46.090]  Maybe we should... let's end on it.
[25:46.130 --> 25:46.290]  Yeah.
[25:46.870 --> 25:50.950]  This is very suspicious. I feel like you two know something I don't.
[25:51.070 --> 25:55.050]  That was very weird. That was weird. I sensed that.
[25:55.190 --> 25:59.150]  I don't know anything. I just... I'm just having a really nice time right now.
[25:59.310 --> 26:02.750]  And once we start talking about the trial, I know I'm going to get all worked up
[26:02.750 --> 26:06.230]  and then you're going to get defensive and then Gavin's going to get involved
[26:06.230 --> 26:09.070]  and it's going to turn into a three-way fuck fest of yelling.
[26:09.650 --> 26:10.750]  Enjoy the non-yelling.
[26:10.990 --> 26:11.530]  No, I am.
[26:11.630 --> 26:12.830]  Yeah, right now we're just hanging out.
[26:12.870 --> 26:14.990]  This is great. I just... I... you know, I...
[26:14.990 --> 26:18.710]  I'm at the point where I'm ready to talk about it as like a bit.
[26:19.050 --> 26:20.030]  I mean, the trial's happened.

[28:01.580 --> 28:02.460]  And I'll be honest with you,
[28:02.460 --> 28:03.980]  I don't like going to the grocery store.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.540]  Sometimes grocery stores smell.
[28:05.820 --> 28:07.500]  Sometimes the people at grocery stores smell.
[28:07.640 --> 28:09.120]  I have a sensitive nose, I'm learning.
[28:09.600 --> 28:11.340]  And I would prefer to save it.
[28:11.760 --> 28:14.700]  HelloFresh offers convenient delivery right to your doorstep

[28:27.260 --> 28:29.560]  HelloFresh cuts out stressful meal planning.
[28:29.700 --> 28:30.640]  I don't like stress.
[28:30.940 --> 28:32.060]  I got enough of it in my life.
[28:32.060 --> 28:36.560]  I'm 45 and I got a 15 year old daughter and a bunch of idiots that work for me.
[28:36.660 --> 28:39.540]  I don't have any room in my life for stress.
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.480]  It's flexible for my lifestyle.
[28:41.980 --> 28:44.420]  I can keep my fridge stocked by adding extra proteins
[28:44.420 --> 28:47.000]  and sides like garlic bread to my weekly order.
[28:47.480 --> 28:49.280]  I just, the other night we had some garlic bread
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.620]  and I looked up and I had eaten, oh gosh,
[28:53.160 --> 28:55.280]  three quarters of it before the meal was ready
[28:55.280 --> 28:57.080]  because the garlic bread got done a little early.
[28:57.260 --> 28:59.320]  And then I realized there were two other people in the house
[28:59.320 --> 29:00.740]  and I felt very guilty.
[29:00.740 --> 29:04.740]  But it was a delicious garlic guilt and it was worth it.
[29:04.920 --> 29:06.900]  HelloFresh delivers pre-portioned ingredients.
[29:06.980 --> 29:08.460]  So you're not just overbuying,
[29:08.700 --> 29:11.040]  which is a burden on the planet and your wallet.
[29:11.160 --> 29:12.100]  This is what I'm talking about.
[29:12.240 --> 29:13.620]  Nobody likes a burden, right?
[29:13.800 --> 29:15.100]  My mom certainly didn't want one.
[29:15.140 --> 29:16.040]  That's why I joined the army.
[29:16.440 --> 29:18.600]  The packaging HelloFresh uses to ship your food
[29:18.600 --> 29:23.480]  is almost entirely made from recyclable and or already recycled content.
[29:23.700 --> 29:26.300]  Kind of like a off topic or well,
[29:26.320 --> 29:28.780]  pretty much anything Rooster Teeth does at this point in 2020, right?
[29:28.780 --> 29:32.240]  I know we've talked about how I feel about the garlic bread, right?
[29:32.840 --> 29:33.960]  Don't get me started.
[29:34.100 --> 29:35.300]  I already covered the garlic bread.
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.160]  I can go back into it if I need to.
[29:37.340 --> 29:41.400]  But once the seal is broken on my garlic bread talk,
[29:41.580 --> 29:42.760]  it's we're going to be off to the races
[29:42.760 --> 29:44.840]  and there's probably not enough time left in this ad.
[29:45.080 --> 29:46.600]  So let's just let me just throw that.
[29:46.720 --> 29:47.620]  I'm just gonna throw it out there again.
[29:48.120 --> 29:48.640]  Garlic bread.
[29:48.940 --> 29:50.680]  I think that says everything we need it to.
[29:50.880 --> 29:53.980]  Go to hellofresh.com slash face 80

[30:22.960 --> 30:25.620]  This fall, as you get back into the swing of things,
[30:26.080 --> 30:30.400]  Bespoke Post has brand new seasonal Box of Awesome collections for you guys.
[30:31.020 --> 30:32.420]  Guaranteed to upgrade your life.
[30:32.740 --> 30:38.200]  I know Jeremy, who's a big Chima Hunter, he's a big fan of Box of Awesome.
[30:38.360 --> 30:41.020]  He talks about his Box of Awesome all the time.
[30:41.160 --> 30:43.820]  He's like Bespoke Post this and Box of Awesome that.
[30:44.120 --> 30:47.520]  And I would literally die without it, is what he says.
[30:47.580 --> 30:52.500]  Don't tell my wife, but it's more important to me than her and my family and our future.
[30:52.500 --> 30:56.140]  I care about one thing and one thing only, Box of Awesome.
[30:56.540 --> 30:58.340]  Now, once again, that's according to Jeremy.
[30:58.700 --> 30:59.500]  But he's a smart dude.
[30:59.820 --> 31:03.140]  You don't make it to his age without getting a few things right.
[31:03.560 --> 31:06.260]  So whether it's gear to upgrade your autumn craft beers
[31:06.260 --> 31:08.960]  or cozy threads for when the temperature dips.
[31:09.200 --> 31:12.840]  Man, I went outside today, it's almost October in Texas.
[31:12.940 --> 31:14.780]  It was a balmy like 88.
[31:15.220 --> 31:16.820]  It's starting to get chilly here.
[31:17.240 --> 31:20.080]  Bespoke Post only sends guys the best stuff every month.
[31:20.080 --> 31:24.900]  No matter what you're into, Box of Awesome has you covered from style and grooming goods
[31:24.900 --> 31:26.280]  to bar like barware.
[31:26.560 --> 31:27.600]  You guys like barware, right?
[31:27.900 --> 31:29.540]  You don't want to you're like, let's be honest.
[31:29.860 --> 31:30.900]  You're older now.
[31:31.160 --> 31:32.660]  You're not crushing beers on your forehead.
[31:33.060 --> 31:38.300]  Get yourself a bar cart, some barware from Box of Awesome and learn to make a Tom Collins
[31:38.300 --> 31:41.780]  or something a little more dignified than just Jaeger bombs.
[31:42.300 --> 31:43.120]  Cooking tools.
[31:43.540 --> 31:45.140]  You should also be learning to cook at this point.
[31:45.200 --> 31:47.960]  If you've made it this far into 2020 without learning to cook,
[31:47.960 --> 31:52.280]  you are behind the curve, my friend, because everybody else on Earth has been using this
[31:52.280 --> 31:53.720]  time to learn to cook.
[31:54.060 --> 31:55.080]  And outdoor gear.
[31:55.520 --> 31:59.780]  Also, I feel like if you've tried to rent an RV in the last three or four months in
[31:59.780 --> 32:02.920]  America, you'll find out they're all taken because everybody wants to get out into the
[32:02.920 --> 32:03.440]  great outdoors.
[32:03.800 --> 32:06.460]  Everybody wants to go hang out at a national park or a state park.
[32:06.920 --> 32:09.720]  You're going to need some good outdoor gear if you're going to go do that.
[32:09.780 --> 32:11.100]  That's why Box of Awesome is important.
[32:11.200 --> 32:13.180]  And they have collections for every part of your life.
[32:13.500 --> 32:15.700]  Maybe it's the outdoor gear part of your life.
[32:15.840 --> 32:17.460]  Maybe it's the cooking tool part of your life.
[32:17.460 --> 32:19.180]  Maybe it's the bar wear or grooming.
[32:19.360 --> 32:19.960]  I don't know.
[32:20.200 --> 32:22.160]  Maybe you just want to be a stylish ass dude.
[32:22.400 --> 32:23.100]  I know I do.
[32:23.520 --> 32:28.640]  To get started, take the quiz at boxofawesome.com and your answers will help them pick the Box
[32:28.640 --> 32:30.200]  of Awesome that's right for you.
[32:30.520 --> 32:34.840]  They release new boxes every month across a ton of different categories, and it's free
[32:34.840 --> 32:35.440]  to sign up.
[32:35.680 --> 32:37.800]  Also, you can skip a month or cancel any time.
[32:38.160 --> 32:40.020]  They're not... you're not locked in for life or anything.
[32:40.140 --> 32:40.760]  They're not jerks.
[32:41.020 --> 32:43.960]  By the way, each box only costs... this is the most important part.
[32:44.160 --> 32:45.600]  Each box only costs $45.
[32:45.600 --> 32:49.940]  But the cool thing is, it's got over $70 inside every time.
[32:50.180 --> 32:54.740]  So you're literally making a profit every time you open one of these things up.
[32:54.920 --> 32:55.760]  Just think about that.
[32:56.120 --> 33:01.160]  So, get 20% off your first monthly box when you sign up at boxofawesome.com and enter
[33:01.160 --> 33:04.920]  the code FACE, F-A-C-E, that is FACE, at checkout.
[33:05.300 --> 33:10.200]  That's boxofawesome.com, code FACE, for 20% off your first box.
[33:10.560 --> 33:14.480]  And I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, if you get your first box, it won't be your last.
[33:16.340 --> 33:17.620]  I would like to talk about...
[33:18.540 --> 33:23.080]  Okay, so last week, you very casually, right at the end of the podcast,
[33:23.520 --> 33:29.680]  brought up how you had secretly been looking through my Halo times and beating them.
[33:29.800 --> 33:35.460]  You were basically ready for me to say, hey, I have a better time than you on this level.
[33:35.680 --> 33:37.920]  So you could be like, no, you don't.
[33:38.540 --> 33:41.600]  And I did have a better time than you because I was working on it,
[33:41.600 --> 33:47.320]  but I didn't bring it up because, A, I want to wait a long time before announcing this on you.
[33:47.360 --> 33:48.340]  I want it to be really inconvenient.
[33:48.900 --> 33:52.720]  And B, I wanted to beat myself even more.
[33:53.080 --> 33:55.700]  But you just so casually were like, by the way, I beat your time,
[33:56.120 --> 34:00.900]  to the point where you were so smug at your timing that I was livid.
[34:01.440 --> 34:04.180]  I was like, I can't believe you just casually threw that out there.
[34:04.200 --> 34:07.400]  I worked hard on that time and you beat it without any fanfare.
[34:07.620 --> 34:10.180]  And I didn't even get to sort of spring it on you.
[34:10.660 --> 34:12.300]  Uh, so now it's on.
[34:12.400 --> 34:13.720]  I'm obviously, I'm trying to smash your time.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.280]  And then you're playing, you've got some dirty tricks going on where you say,
[34:18.360 --> 34:24.300]  I basically, I beat the time that you beat and you were suspicious of my methods.
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.560]  And then you just came to me and said, uh, you're screwed.
[34:28.700 --> 34:29.680]  The time is trapped.
[34:30.240 --> 34:30.840]  I trapped it.
[34:31.260 --> 34:32.080]  What does that mean?
[34:32.480 --> 34:33.960]  I trapped, do I need to clarify?
[34:34.100 --> 34:35.440]  I feel like you should know what it means.
[34:35.480 --> 34:36.060]  I trapped it.
[34:36.100 --> 34:37.720]  I'm assuming we're doing the same method.
[34:38.100 --> 34:39.640]  It's a, it's a trap strategy.
[34:40.180 --> 34:45.400]  As soon as you go, I go and we're just, it's back on you.
[34:45.600 --> 34:46.680]  As far as you say it's trapped.
[34:46.900 --> 34:50.940]  What I took that to mean was you have the time done.
[34:51.320 --> 34:52.840]  You just, you just don't have it submitted.
[34:53.280 --> 34:54.560]  Is that what you mean by trapped?
[34:54.820 --> 34:57.400]  Yeah, I think that's a fair explanation.
[34:57.560 --> 34:58.600]  So it's mind games.
[34:58.720 --> 35:04.360]  So you're basically guessing that you have a better time, a trapped time than my trapped
[35:04.360 --> 35:04.740]  time.
[35:04.880 --> 35:06.520]  And we're just not submitting our times.
[35:07.180 --> 35:08.140]  We're in a real stare down.
[35:08.140 --> 35:10.880]  I submitted my, I told you what my trapped time is.
[35:11.280 --> 35:12.120]  You just didn't put it in.
[35:12.320 --> 35:13.360]  No, I was waiting.
[35:13.700 --> 35:14.020]  It's trapped.
[35:14.200 --> 35:14.260]  Here's the thing.
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.720]  This is healthy for the, for the overall bet, because as we keep beating our times or trapping
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.120]  our times, they get harder and harder to beat each time to the point where potentially 12
[35:24.120 --> 35:25.120]  hours might not be enough.
[35:25.440 --> 35:30.640]  So you have, there's a method with which you keep calling it trapping your time, but you
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.020]  like, you beat the time offline or something, and then you just don't, don't sign back on.
[35:35.240 --> 35:37.560]  So for the sake of the audience, I'll just go through it.
[35:37.560 --> 35:43.500]  So the type, the, uh, the level is outskirts, which is a Halo 2 map where, uh, you just fight
[35:43.500 --> 35:45.860]  through where you're in Africa, you're on earth.
[35:46.900 --> 35:49.740]  And the way that the timing works, you can just save and quit.
[35:50.080 --> 35:52.360]  And it will basically hold the time that you have.
[35:52.560 --> 35:55.320]  So restarting a checkpoint continues to add time.
[35:55.400 --> 35:59.380]  But if you die, instead of just having it restart the checkpoint, if you just save and quit,
[35:59.620 --> 36:01.800]  you just go from whatever the time was at that checkpoint.
[36:01.940 --> 36:04.200]  So you can actually sort of slow build your times.
[36:05.040 --> 36:09.040]  And if you do that right before you end the level, you don't have a submitted time, but
[36:09.040 --> 36:09.880]  you have one ready to go.
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.340]  You just have to then do the last checkpoint.
[36:11.480 --> 36:12.360]  Is that what you've been doing, Andrew?
[36:12.660 --> 36:13.600]  That is what I've been doing.
[36:13.720 --> 36:16.720]  Did you know you could do that when you started this?
[36:16.800 --> 36:18.400]  When did you learn that that was an option?
[36:18.820 --> 36:19.640]  Uh, I've always known.
[36:19.900 --> 36:20.240]  Okay.
[36:20.380 --> 36:21.000]  I didn't know.
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.000]  I thought it was just...
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.020]  You got the actual, the speed running achievement without doing that?
[36:26.760 --> 36:27.120]  Yeah.
[36:27.460 --> 36:27.860]  Yeah, I did.
[36:28.180 --> 36:28.760]  Oh shit.
[36:28.960 --> 36:29.880]  So you're really good.
[36:30.960 --> 36:32.340]  I didn't know it was an option.
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.660]  What happened was I was trying to beat Gavin's dumb time and I was in the middle of a great
[36:37.660 --> 36:40.060]  run, I was near the end, and my game crashed.
[36:40.480 --> 36:42.740]  And I was like, fuck, I lost the run.
[36:43.220 --> 36:45.780]  And it was like 4am, so I wasn't really thinking.
[36:46.200 --> 36:50.680]  And instead of just loading up a new run, I accidentally clicked resume and it put me
[36:50.680 --> 36:51.620]  back to where I was.
[36:51.800 --> 36:54.000]  And the time was back to where it was at that checkpoint.
[36:54.300 --> 36:56.520]  And it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.
[36:57.120 --> 36:59.840]  If I wouldn't have, if it would have never crashed, I would have never known.
[36:59.980 --> 37:01.940]  And there's no way I would have ever come close to you.
[37:02.340 --> 37:09.140]  I want to try and find in the slack where you got really suspicious.
[37:10.280 --> 37:11.840]  Yeah, you're good.
[37:12.080 --> 37:15.620]  If the times you're presenting are legitimate, you're very good at Halo 2.
[37:16.200 --> 37:19.020]  Okay, so we would just go back and forth with our times.
[37:19.300 --> 37:22.740]  And then on slack, you said to me, how are you cheating?
[37:24.140 --> 37:27.100]  He's cheating in some way and I don't know what it is.
[37:27.380 --> 37:31.260]  I said, no cheating, just playing some Halo, developing some strats.
[37:31.260 --> 37:35.980]  You said, so I'm supposed to believe you just show up and set the 87th
[37:35.980 --> 37:37.940]  best time in the world for outskirts.
[37:38.400 --> 37:40.800]  I said, sure, why not?
[37:41.200 --> 37:42.420]  New strats, new times.
[37:43.840 --> 37:48.460]  You said, you don't go from hitting a career average of two homers a year
[37:48.460 --> 37:52.260]  and then suddenly hit 87 and say, you're holding the bat differently.
[37:52.920 --> 37:53.760]  Something stinks.
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.980]  And I guess you discovered my technique of saving and quitting.
[38:01.260 --> 38:01.960]  I did.
[38:02.280 --> 38:04.660]  So we've basically got our times down. This is on Legendary,
[38:04.760 --> 38:06.340]  so it's actually incredibly easy to die.
[38:06.580 --> 38:10.760]  But we're now sub four minutes and I'm not using any...
[38:10.760 --> 38:13.640]  Well, I'm using like my... I'm just going my own way.
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.040]  I'm not following videos in hope that you don't know what I'm doing
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.320]  to the point where you can't copy what I've done.
[38:19.560 --> 38:23.640]  If you're saying you're not using videos, you are 100% cheating.
[38:23.840 --> 38:25.060]  There's no way.
[38:25.360 --> 38:26.080]  Not cheating.
[38:26.380 --> 38:27.400]  There's no way.
[38:27.620 --> 38:28.400]  I'm not cheating.
[38:28.400 --> 38:31.740]  I want... I need to see what... You'd have to edit it together
[38:31.740 --> 38:34.820]  because I assume you're closing your game out every 40 seconds.
[38:35.080 --> 38:39.180]  But I would love to see what a run of yours looks like.
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.260]  I'll show you my run after the 12 hours have passed and you've lost the bet.
[38:43.500 --> 38:44.820]  I'm excited for that.
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.360]  I think I might lose, honestly. You're doing really well.
[38:47.640 --> 38:48.980]  I'll say this for him, Andrew.
[38:49.220 --> 38:54.280]  He's got none of your talent when it comes to playing video games.
[38:54.300 --> 38:54.980]  Absolutely right.
[38:54.980 --> 38:56.440]  None of your ability.
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.760]  But he knows Halo and the levels and the maps in Halo better than
[39:02.360 --> 39:04.380]  probably a lot of the people that worked on them.
[39:05.600 --> 39:06.780]  Yeah, I mean, that's fair.
[39:06.900 --> 39:10.780]  I thought I knew Halo as well, but he's showing a whole other level.
[39:11.120 --> 39:13.500]  He came in... I remember being blown away.
[39:13.600 --> 39:15.540]  He came in. We made...
[39:15.540 --> 39:18.960]  This is my being nice about Gavin segment of the podcast.
[39:19.580 --> 39:22.220]  He came in and directed season seven of Red vs. Blue.
[39:22.220 --> 39:25.240]  And so we had already made six seasons at that point.
[39:25.500 --> 39:28.360]  Plus... and a season was 20 episodes, two hours.
[39:28.840 --> 39:32.440]  Plus for every episode we made, we probably made two or three for
[39:32.440 --> 39:36.620]  corporate gigs or sponsorships, whatever.
[39:36.840 --> 39:38.380]  We made a shitload of...
[39:39.660 --> 39:42.340]  Probably by the time we made seven seasons of Red vs. Blue,
[39:42.400 --> 39:44.080]  we probably made 20 seasons worth of content.
[39:44.320 --> 39:46.880]  I thought I knew that game like the back of my hand.
[39:47.020 --> 39:51.180]  Like I knew everything about Halo 1, 2, 3, and Reach at that point.
[39:51.180 --> 39:54.980]  And this little British dickhead came in, and in the first day...
[39:55.680 --> 39:58.620]  By the end of the first day, Bernie and I, our jaws were on the ground.
[39:58.720 --> 40:01.140]  We're like, how the fuck did he know how to do that and that and that?
[40:01.280 --> 40:02.660]  He taught us so much.
[40:03.060 --> 40:06.680]  He must... I can only assume that his life in England,
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.440]  and probably why he moved to America, was so... just abysmal.
[40:12.940 --> 40:16.720]  And I don't know if it was the weather or if he would walk outside,
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.480]  there would immediately be a chav ready to punch him in the teeth.
[40:20.480 --> 40:24.720]  So he just never left his house, or maybe he was scared to leave his bedroom
[40:24.720 --> 40:26.180]  because his parents were abusive or something.
[40:26.300 --> 40:30.520]  I don't know what it was, but he must have just lived inside
[40:31.040 --> 40:34.580]  the world of Halo for the first 17 years he was alive.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.220]  I'll be honest, I know exactly what it was.
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.420]  I was just a teenager who had no friends.
[40:39.620 --> 40:42.240]  I actually was fine at school.
[40:42.380 --> 40:44.520]  Like I had this like pretty solid friend group,
[40:45.060 --> 40:49.540]  but they all got pretty into drugs, which, you know, it was fine with me.
[40:49.540 --> 40:50.980]  I just didn't want to do it.
[40:51.220 --> 40:53.060]  So they just stopped inviting me to stuff,
[40:53.280 --> 40:58.200]  because I was always just like, I'm not gonna be involved.
[40:58.620 --> 41:01.480]  So I was just like, I just was unneeded.
[41:02.500 --> 41:07.060]  So I just stayed in and played Halo for, what, until I found a different group of friends.
[41:07.260 --> 41:09.500]  But that was a good, maybe three or four year period there,
[41:09.560 --> 41:11.540]  where I just play Halo all the time. It was great.
[41:11.900 --> 41:13.620]  I love the idea of you at a party being like,
[41:13.660 --> 41:15.920]  you guys see that new Super Jump on Lockout?
[41:16.460 --> 41:17.720]  Pretty crazy, right?
[41:18.820 --> 41:20.700]  How's everybody's teamwork consistent?
[41:21.640 --> 41:25.720]  You hug the back of the base on Coagulation, you slip down, you hit the Super Jump.
[41:26.880 --> 41:28.220]  I missed that. That was fun.
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.040]  That was fun.
[41:29.440 --> 41:32.000]  I was in a clan in Halo 2 called Nuts on Your Chin.
[41:32.600 --> 41:33.360]  I was like 12.
[41:35.300 --> 41:39.680]  It was me and like a bunch of 20 and 30 year old guys.
[41:39.780 --> 41:41.740]  It was run by a guy who was a tattoo artist.
[41:42.120 --> 41:43.540]  And at the end of every game,
[41:43.580 --> 41:46.380]  you had to teabag people and say nuts on your chin over and over again.
[41:46.380 --> 41:48.000]  It was a very sophisticated group.
[41:48.960 --> 41:49.960]  Was that it?
[41:50.320 --> 41:51.140]  That's it.
[41:52.080 --> 41:54.220]  I'm laughing so hard, I'm laughing quietly.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.420]  I don't know what else do you want from me?
[41:57.620 --> 42:00.620]  I was just sharing a nice Halo 2 story.
[42:00.640 --> 42:02.580]  I thought you were going to tell a nuts on my chin anecdote,
[42:02.880 --> 42:04.640]  and then I wasn't ready for it to be over.
[42:04.980 --> 42:07.420]  No, it's just a weird thing.
[42:07.840 --> 42:09.300]  It's a clan called Nuts on Your Chin.
[42:09.680 --> 42:11.180]  Do you still hang out with those guys?
[42:11.460 --> 42:11.800]  No.
[42:12.420 --> 42:12.640]  Yeah.
[42:13.720 --> 42:17.240]  No, I don't think I'm still in the clan.
[42:17.360 --> 42:18.540]  I think they probably kicked me out.
[42:18.660 --> 42:20.000]  It's a hard group to get into.
[42:20.260 --> 42:23.500]  Do you think the Nuts on Your Chin clan is still going strong?
[42:23.780 --> 42:24.660]  I don't think so.
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.960]  I think that's probably a clan that became less funny with time.
[42:29.120 --> 42:29.480]  I'm sure.
[42:30.200 --> 42:32.120]  That was always the thing with...
[42:32.120 --> 42:34.440]  I mean, my relationship with you, Andrew, and Halo is that
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.780]  I would be very good at one thing, like say, grifball.
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.720]  I mean, I was good at grifball because we were the only people playing it.
[42:41.800 --> 42:43.760]  There were only like eight people playing at the time.
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.360]  And then you came in and just made us all look like infants
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.840]  who didn't know how to hold a controller.
[42:50.160 --> 42:52.980]  And that's just carried on the entire time I've known you.
[42:53.360 --> 42:54.360]  That's been our story.
[42:54.520 --> 42:58.680]  I've been trying to beat you with stuff and you just casually destroy me.
[42:58.820 --> 43:02.800]  And I feel like eventually I'll come out on top, but I just don't know when that will be.
[43:03.080 --> 43:03.940]  You definitely will.
[43:04.040 --> 43:09.680]  The secret, from my perspective, is that you guys are not great at really any game.
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.660]  I'm not. It's not that I'm so good. I'm very average.
[43:14.040 --> 43:18.620]  It's just your bar is so low that I can come in and I look way more aggressive.
[43:18.860 --> 43:19.420]  That's bullshit.
[43:20.220 --> 43:22.660]  Every time I talk, you're into a game.
[43:23.060 --> 43:23.940]  It's not that you're average.
[43:24.200 --> 43:25.660]  We were talking about, like, I...
[43:25.660 --> 43:29.140]  By the way, did you see Left 4 Dead is updating for like 10 years?
[43:29.520 --> 43:30.360]  How fucking crazy is that?
[43:30.380 --> 43:31.980]  Not to turn this into a video game podcast.
[43:32.440 --> 43:34.040]  Dude, get nuts on your chin back together.
[43:34.440 --> 43:36.640]  There's 30 new achievements and there's going to be...
[43:36.640 --> 43:37.900]  Like, that's fucking exciting.
[43:37.900 --> 43:42.100]  But, like, back in, like, the Left 4 Dead days, I would get Andrew to help me.
[43:42.220 --> 43:44.640]  And then Andrew just casually drops one, like, one day.
[43:44.700 --> 43:46.000]  He's like, yeah, I was looking up...
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.060]  I was looking up online some way, I do.
[43:48.300 --> 43:51.500]  And I'm, like, the third best Left 4 Dead player in the world right now.
[43:51.620 --> 43:52.060]  Isn't that weird?
[43:53.600 --> 43:56.020]  What's even weirder about that is I don't remember that.
[43:56.320 --> 43:56.720]  But that happens.
[43:56.720 --> 43:58.660]  I do. It definitely happened.
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.140]  Can you imagine how frustrating it would be for Andrew to be number two in the world at Halo?
[44:03.400 --> 44:04.380]  Like he is at Garfield?
[44:05.480 --> 44:06.940]  And Gavin is number one?
[44:07.500 --> 44:08.740]  I'd be okay with that.
[44:08.820 --> 44:10.580]  If Gavin can get number one, that's great.
[44:10.720 --> 44:15.440]  It wouldn't happen because he would just spend the next 200 days back to back
[44:15.440 --> 44:17.240]  doing it until he was number one.
[44:17.540 --> 44:17.700]  Yeah.
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.140]  Because that's the kind of person he is.
[44:19.240 --> 44:20.580]  The stakes are so high for this.
[44:20.840 --> 44:22.120]  I think I'd give you Halo 2.
[44:22.840 --> 44:26.800]  You've impressed me with the techniques, what you're saying.
[44:26.960 --> 44:29.660]  The fact that you're not using any videos is impressive.
[44:30.040 --> 44:30.600]  I'll give you that.
[44:31.000 --> 44:31.480]  Should we...
[44:31.480 --> 44:33.380]  Geoff, what do you got this week for f*** face?
[44:33.540 --> 44:35.120]  Oh, I do have a little f*** face.
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.600]  Well, and I have some housekeeping I wanted to do as well.
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.760]  I think I'm being pranked or plagued by a gentle ghost.
[44:46.600 --> 44:47.040]  Okay.
[44:47.440 --> 44:51.900]  I was at the, what I'm now referring to as the f*** face intersection in Austin.
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.300]  And I say that because it's, you know, I ride my bike like 30 miles a day.
[44:55.600 --> 44:56.580]  It's my exercise.
[44:56.940 --> 44:59.420]  And so I go, well, I go all over town.
[44:59.500 --> 45:02.500]  But there's this one intersection that I go through pretty often.
[45:02.600 --> 45:03.960]  It's a big intersection.
[45:04.820 --> 45:06.920]  The other day, maybe like a month or two ago,
[45:07.140 --> 45:09.740]  I was stopped at the stoplight waiting to go.
[45:10.100 --> 45:14.460]  And I say it's the f*** face intersection because a guy rolled down his window next to me
[45:14.460 --> 45:16.880]  and goes, hey, and I'm like, ugh.
[45:17.260 --> 45:19.700]  So I turn over and I look and he goes, great job with the f*** face.
[45:20.000 --> 45:21.380]  And I went, oh, thanks, man.
[45:21.420 --> 45:22.100]  He goes, yeah, I love it.
[45:22.160 --> 45:22.680]  Listen to it all the time.
[45:22.900 --> 45:23.540]  And he drove off.
[45:23.660 --> 45:26.740]  I thought he was going to yell at me or make fun of me or ask for directions or something.
[45:26.860 --> 45:30.600]  You thought it was going to be like that guy when we were having drinks at that bar, the homeless guy?
[45:30.600 --> 45:34.060]  Yeah, I think he was going to tell me what's wrong with Austin or whatever.
[45:34.300 --> 45:34.960]  Do you know about that, Andrew?
[45:35.560 --> 45:37.720]  Yes, I think you brought that up on this podcast.
[45:37.940 --> 45:38.200]  Oh, OK.
[45:38.380 --> 45:41.780]  And so every time I stop at that stoplight, I think about that moment.
[45:41.880 --> 45:43.740]  I'm like, oh, this is the f*** face stoplight.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.940]  And I was actually thinking about I had just read some slacks from you, Andrew, about f*** face.
[45:49.560 --> 45:52.940]  Potentially, we talked about making baseball cards, you know, or collectible cards,
[45:52.960 --> 45:54.560]  what they would look like, what would be on the cards.
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.180]  And I was kind of running through the list that you had,
[45:56.240 --> 45:59.560]  you had slacked and kind of thinking about if I want to cut my shorts up or not.
[46:01.400 --> 46:02.820]  And some other stuff.
[46:03.400 --> 46:06.960]  And and while I was doing that, I had been stopped for 30 seconds.
[46:07.080 --> 46:09.320]  I was standing up the same way I always do.
[46:09.420 --> 46:12.720]  Left foot on the ground, right foot on the curb to the right.
[46:12.840 --> 46:14.280]  And I was perfectly vertical.
[46:14.820 --> 46:16.420]  No breeze, no nothing.
[46:16.860 --> 46:18.780]  And I just looked up and I went, yep, light's still red.
[46:18.860 --> 46:20.080]  And then I went back into my head.
[46:20.200 --> 46:21.720]  Think about f*** face collectible cards.
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.560]  And then suddenly I noticed I was very slowly tilting to the right.
[46:25.780 --> 46:27.280]  And I thought, that's weird.
[46:27.280 --> 46:30.640]  And I looked up and the traffic light was crooked, too.
[46:30.980 --> 46:33.660]  And I realized I was really, really slowly,
[46:33.960 --> 46:37.120]  as if by being pushed by the most gentle of ghosts,
[46:37.460 --> 46:40.160]  just being nudged over, like laid down.
[46:40.500 --> 46:42.540]  And there was nothing I could do about it.
[46:42.760 --> 46:45.500]  My right foot was immediately trapped under the bike.
[46:45.820 --> 46:47.580]  And like gravity didn't speed me up,
[46:47.620 --> 46:49.940]  which is why I know it must have been a ghost laying me down.
[46:50.280 --> 46:51.780]  And there was no wind.
[46:52.200 --> 46:53.580]  Gravity didn't intensify things.
[46:53.580 --> 46:55.740]  And it just, as if in a cartoon,
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.960]  slowly laid me down onto the ground under my bike
[46:58.960 --> 47:01.440]  in the exact same position I was standing up in,
[47:01.660 --> 47:04.880]  as if like I got hit with a freeze ray and I just topped over.
[47:04.980 --> 47:08.700]  But without any kind of like a terminal velocity from the gravity.
[47:09.300 --> 47:15.100]  And unfortunately, there were 4,000 cars around and they all saw it.
[47:15.180 --> 47:17.000]  And also it had rained the day before.
[47:17.180 --> 47:20.680]  So the ghost gently laid me down into a mud puddle,
[47:20.700 --> 47:22.020]  like a grassy mud puddle.
[47:22.020 --> 47:26.160]  And so I just laid the entire right side of my body covered in mud
[47:26.160 --> 47:28.740]  and under my bike for a second.
[47:29.080 --> 47:30.700]  And I didn't know what to do.
[47:30.920 --> 47:32.100]  A lot of cars looking at me.
[47:32.220 --> 47:35.120]  I look up every... I make an eye contact with at least 20 people.
[47:35.560 --> 47:41.120]  And so I just sat there and laughed and waited for till every car left.
[47:41.260 --> 47:43.860]  And then I got on my bike and then sat through another cycle and left.
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.860]  But yeah, so now I'm on the lookout to see if the ghost strikes again,
[47:46.880 --> 47:48.860]  because it was super paranormal.
[47:49.220 --> 47:50.360]  I feel like maybe instead of a ghost,
[47:50.360 --> 47:52.400]  you just have like an ear infection or something.
[47:52.620 --> 47:54.040]  I don't think so. I don't think so.
[47:54.740 --> 47:58.700]  Because usually when I start falling, I don't figure it out based on my eyes.
[47:59.040 --> 48:01.040]  I can usually figure out what I'm falling.
[48:01.160 --> 48:04.560]  I'm not like, man, what's with all these 45 degree angles?
[48:04.820 --> 48:07.060]  I noticed it. It was totally noticed the angle. Yeah.
[48:07.320 --> 48:08.440]  It was so strange.
[48:08.940 --> 48:11.100]  Have you been hit by any baseballs recently?
[48:11.280 --> 48:13.680]  No, I haven't. I don't know. I can't play any song.
[48:13.740 --> 48:14.980]  So yeah, no, nothing.
[48:15.120 --> 48:16.760]  I have another question for you, Geoff.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.340]  Of the 30 miles that you cycle a day,
[48:19.340 --> 48:20.940]  how many miles do you actually pedal?
[48:21.160 --> 48:22.080]  The entire time, baby.
[48:22.360 --> 48:24.600]  You gotta pedal. That's how you get places.
[48:24.900 --> 48:25.760]  I'm not driving a car.
[48:25.920 --> 48:27.900]  You got an electric bike that does the driving.
[48:28.100 --> 48:30.560]  It's pedal assist when I need it.
[48:30.860 --> 48:32.320]  I'm not trying to be Lance Armstrong.
[48:32.600 --> 48:35.000]  I'm not shooting myself up with performance enhancing drugs here.
[48:35.100 --> 48:37.680]  I'm just trying to ride around and get some fucking breeze, baby.
[48:37.900 --> 48:39.860]  It's 100 degrees every day in Austin.
[48:40.300 --> 48:43.180]  7am, it's like 75 degrees and breezy. It's beautiful.
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.440]  I wonder if any dopers have used a pedal assist bike as well.
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.420]  I think that would be easier to catch.
[48:50.540 --> 48:52.460]  I mean, the cheating is pretty extreme.
[48:52.560 --> 48:53.340]  I feel like there is.
[48:53.440 --> 48:57.340]  Wasn't there a story of like a guy that had a cork in his mouth or something?
[48:57.480 --> 48:59.460]  And there's a fishing line to a car.
[48:59.680 --> 49:01.380]  He's using that for a little boost.
[49:02.620 --> 49:04.840]  So he's getting pulled along by his teeth.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.260]  Yeah, I believe that was the thing.
[49:06.340 --> 49:10.320]  Or there's even like, I think the best endurance runner in the world.
[49:10.640 --> 49:14.140]  He cheated by using porta potties, which was really smart.
[49:14.140 --> 49:19.120]  He'd run a lap and then he'd hop in a porta potty and wait like eight minutes
[49:19.120 --> 49:21.940]  and then pretend that that was the second lap and run through.
[49:22.260 --> 49:23.260]  And that was his whole game plan.
[49:23.540 --> 49:24.780]  You'd be very innovative with cheating.
[49:25.000 --> 49:25.780]  That's really smart.
[49:25.940 --> 49:26.340]  It was.
[49:26.480 --> 49:27.800]  I thought that was going to be way more interesting.
[49:27.880 --> 49:31.220]  I thought you were going to say that he'd like tunneled between two porta potties.
[49:31.360 --> 49:33.400]  And he was like, I'm fucking Andy Dufresne.
[49:33.700 --> 49:35.540]  He's just asked to wait seven minutes.
[49:39.280 --> 49:40.140]  One other thing.
[49:40.200 --> 49:41.020]  I said I had some housekeeping.
[49:41.020 --> 49:45.920]  As you know, part of the whole point of the F*** Face podcast,
[49:46.260 --> 49:49.080]  aside from telling hilarious stories about how we f*** our own faces,
[49:49.460 --> 49:52.480]  is we have the world's greatest F*** Face collection.
[49:52.820 --> 49:56.600]  And currently, Andrew and I are the only two people in the world to have the complete collection.
[49:56.940 --> 50:01.140]  I know there's been some discussion about adding in Fred Roberts and Bussy,
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.420]  but the initial collection was only the Billy Ripken F*** Face card
[50:05.420 --> 50:09.280]  and Coolio's Daredevil autograph card for the movie he got cut from.
[50:09.280 --> 50:13.940]  Andrew, I wanted to congratulate Logo Da Fish who tweeted me.
[50:14.200 --> 50:16.920]  He or she or they are a member of our club.
[50:17.220 --> 50:21.020]  They displayed their Billy Ripken and their Daredevil card.
[50:21.380 --> 50:27.980]  So if you want to add in a Fred Roberts and a Tom Martin, Bussy, Tom, him?
[50:28.240 --> 50:29.500]  I think it's Tom. I think you're right.
[50:29.620 --> 50:32.520]  It's Tom. Tom Martin and Fred Roberts, feel free.
[50:32.600 --> 50:34.520]  Those will probably be easier to get than the two they already got.
[50:34.680 --> 50:38.360]  But Logo Da Fish, you're in the F*** Face club, buddy.
[50:38.360 --> 50:40.000]  Congratulations. Congratulations.
[50:40.420 --> 50:41.340]  Man, I gotta get involved.
[50:41.620 --> 50:42.880]  Have you got your Fred Roberts card?
[50:43.020 --> 50:43.800]  Looking at it right here.
[50:43.960 --> 50:46.480]  Hell of a hell of a set of eyebrows, Mr. Roberts.
[50:46.940 --> 50:49.260]  Came with a certificate of authenticity.
[50:49.640 --> 50:50.600]  Really? Yeah.
[50:50.720 --> 50:51.960]  For just a normal card?
[50:52.140 --> 50:53.480]  Well, it's autographed, but...
[50:53.480 --> 50:54.560]  Oh, you got an autograph one too?
[50:54.760 --> 50:57.660]  Yeah, 67. It's item number 67604.
[50:58.220 --> 51:01.700]  You mentioned his eyebrows. He is... it's like Anthony Davis level.
[51:01.940 --> 51:05.060]  It is. He was ahead of the curve. He set the bar for Davis.
[51:05.240 --> 51:07.240]  Did you know that there was a guy I was in high school with?
[51:07.240 --> 51:11.080]  I didn't... I wasn't friends with him, so I didn't call him this, but other people did.
[51:11.160 --> 51:12.340]  He would have beat me up if I did it.
[51:12.520 --> 51:17.860]  But he had eyebrows that crossed... kind of like Gus, or like Anthony Davis or Fred Roberts.
[51:18.200 --> 51:20.080]  But his eyebrows crossed a little bit.
[51:20.340 --> 51:23.980]  So they were... it was like a unibrow, but it crossed a tiny bit.
[51:24.260 --> 51:26.660]  And so they called him Malcolm X Eyebrows.
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.240]  Because his eyebrows were like an X.
[51:29.460 --> 51:30.960]  Or some people would call him X-Man.
[51:31.240 --> 51:33.420]  I get it. I like the framing of,
[51:33.420 --> 51:39.080]  Did you know that some kids in the high school I went to called this other kid this nickname?
[51:39.360 --> 51:43.000]  How would we possibly know? We assuredly didn't know that.
[51:43.100 --> 51:44.500]  Oh, did you? You weren't aware?
[51:44.720 --> 51:46.860]  No. No, I was not aware.
[51:47.100 --> 51:48.260]  Okay. Well, it's good to know.
[51:48.320 --> 51:52.200]  You think, uh, if I'm not keeping in touch with nuts on your chin, I'm keeping...
[51:53.460 --> 51:55.440]  Oh, man.
[51:55.700 --> 51:57.720]  Dude, so what's with the Ian shit?
[51:57.900 --> 51:58.940]  Yeah. Can you explain?
[51:59.200 --> 51:59.560]  Okay.
[51:59.780 --> 52:02.420]  Is it time for Ian? We're already kind of at the end of this episode.
[52:02.420 --> 52:05.300]  Well, I have one hell of a great f***face story.
[52:05.560 --> 52:07.020]  So I don't know. Can I fit two in?
[52:07.380 --> 52:09.980]  Ian thing I don't think is that long. The other one, I don't know.
[52:10.240 --> 52:12.620]  Okay. So when we're doing the court case, right?
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.800]  And Geoff and I both came up with our joke pieces of evidence where it was
[52:16.800 --> 52:20.920]  just splices of audio put together to make a singular statement.
[52:21.160 --> 52:23.740]  Yes. One of us did an excellent job with that.
[52:24.380 --> 52:25.580]  I think we both did.
[52:25.780 --> 52:30.220]  But when I went to do that, I thought I'm going to need to source words.
[52:30.220 --> 52:32.340]  How like this is going to be a lot of work.
[52:32.580 --> 52:35.660]  The more people I can get working on this, the easier it'd be.
[52:35.840 --> 52:38.160]  And it's also just fun to involve the community and stuff.
[52:38.340 --> 52:38.880]  So I tweeted.
[52:39.480 --> 52:42.580]  If you are an Achievement Hunter fan and also have a Discord,
[52:43.040 --> 52:45.120]  let me know. I have a project that you could work on.
[52:45.280 --> 52:48.520]  Did not anticipate the response. It was very overwhelming.
[52:48.940 --> 52:52.260]  There were like 300 people requesting invites within the first hour.
[52:52.440 --> 52:54.880]  And I was just inviting people away.
[52:55.220 --> 52:59.920]  I had one friend in there and they were reporting me the chaos that was happening.
[52:59.920 --> 53:04.020]  And I guess what had happened is two of the people had the same name of Ian.
[53:04.420 --> 53:09.180]  And then they thought it would be funny as a joke if they all called themselves Ian.
[53:09.420 --> 53:13.060]  So it'd be harder for me to address specific people, from my understanding.
[53:13.320 --> 53:17.240]  And at that point, I just thought there's no way I'm going to be able to communicate
[53:17.240 --> 53:19.340]  to get like this is chaos.
[53:19.760 --> 53:21.580]  So I just killed the server.
[53:21.780 --> 53:25.760]  And then they made their own server and invited a bunch of people to it.
[53:25.920 --> 53:27.040]  And they became the Ians.
[53:27.040 --> 53:28.780]  And I joined as a joke.
[53:29.140 --> 53:31.880]  And I said, tell me who is the original Ian.
[53:32.100 --> 53:33.220]  He revealed himself.
[53:33.400 --> 53:36.000]  And then I blocked him on Twitter and said, I killed your God.
[53:36.080 --> 53:36.600]  And I left.
[53:36.620 --> 53:39.180]  And I kind of expected it to end there.
[53:39.180 --> 53:40.680]  But they just kept growing.
[53:40.780 --> 53:44.440]  And I'd see their posts on the subreddit, on the RiskyTees subreddit.
[53:44.600 --> 53:45.800]  And it became like a whole thing.
[53:46.120 --> 53:47.160]  So then I joined them.
[53:47.320 --> 53:49.100]  And because there's also a Krampus discord.
[53:49.420 --> 53:52.400]  And I thought these really, they need to merge somehow.
[53:52.560 --> 53:53.840]  So I came into the Ian discord.
[53:54.080 --> 53:56.420]  And I declared a Garfield Kart competition.
[53:56.420 --> 53:59.720]  Both sides would have to nominate a champion.
[53:59.960 --> 54:00.540]  An Ian?
[54:01.040 --> 54:01.720]  An Ian, yeah.
[54:01.940 --> 54:04.120]  Whoever wins gets to keep their server.
[54:04.320 --> 54:05.680]  Loser has to delete their home.
[54:05.960 --> 54:06.940]  You can merge, obviously.
[54:07.040 --> 54:08.100]  There could be an alliance afterward.
[54:08.400 --> 54:09.940]  But there's no need for two servers.
[54:10.160 --> 54:13.540]  So there was a Garfield Kart battle between the Ians and the Krampuses.
[54:15.020 --> 54:18.680]  That was very fun to observe.
[54:19.720 --> 54:22.280]  All the while this was happening, I just made a third discord.
[54:22.400 --> 54:23.900]  Because I thought this is sort of insane.
[54:23.900 --> 54:26.140]  There should just be a f*** face discord.
[54:26.460 --> 54:27.500]  So I started that.
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.880]  And they've since merged.
[54:30.180 --> 54:30.880]  I had two people.
[54:31.260 --> 54:32.840]  One from each of the discords come in.
[54:33.080 --> 54:34.780]  They did a wonderful job.
[54:34.980 --> 54:37.360]  The f*** face discord is way nicer than it should.
[54:37.440 --> 54:38.180]  It is beautiful.
[54:38.400 --> 54:39.820]  They did such a great job.
[54:39.900 --> 54:41.240]  They're incredibly thoughtful people.
[54:41.540 --> 54:42.580]  And so yeah, they had their tournaments.
[54:42.720 --> 54:43.540]  The Ians lost.
[54:43.700 --> 54:44.980]  But then everybody merged.
[54:45.220 --> 54:46.280]  And the Ians are done.
[54:46.480 --> 54:48.620]  I love the kind of people that it attracts.
[54:48.740 --> 54:50.100]  Like the f*** face audience.
[54:50.500 --> 54:51.440]  It's perfect.
[54:51.440 --> 54:55.960]  They immediately start f***ing you back by doing the whole Ian thing.
[54:56.040 --> 54:58.100]  It's really like a magical synergy.
[54:58.360 --> 54:59.400]  It was very confusing.
[54:59.620 --> 55:02.420]  You're supposed to let these things happen naturally.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.160]  And I'm not trying to gently nudge.
[55:05.320 --> 55:10.520]  But I wonder if the f*** face community wants to be labeled as something like face f***ers.
[55:11.620 --> 55:12.180]  F***ers.
[55:12.600 --> 55:15.960]  In the discord, they're referred to as f***ers.
[55:16.060 --> 55:17.080]  F***ers is cool.
[55:17.860 --> 55:21.000]  I think f***ers is better than face f***ers.
[55:21.000 --> 55:21.720]  I don't think anyone...
[55:22.460 --> 55:23.500]  A face f***er is...
[55:23.500 --> 55:25.520]  F*** Andrews or whatever.
[55:25.980 --> 55:27.520]  Nah, it's not a good one either.
[55:27.640 --> 55:28.900]  You don't like face f***ers?
[55:29.680 --> 55:31.200]  No, I'm not a big fan.
[55:31.340 --> 55:33.900]  I'm imagining a very different scene from Alien.
[55:35.900 --> 55:36.740]  Oh my god.
[55:36.860 --> 55:37.500]  So that's the Ians.
[55:37.700 --> 55:38.680]  I feel like I covered it.
[55:38.700 --> 55:39.880]  Okay, I'm glad I'm in the know.
[55:40.020 --> 55:42.620]  I zoned out for some of it, but I'll go back and re-listen to this.
[55:42.940 --> 55:43.840]  What are you doing?
[55:44.540 --> 55:45.040]  I don't know.
[55:45.100 --> 55:46.540]  I was droning on about...
[55:46.540 --> 55:49.740]  I missed the part where the name Ian was a thing.
[55:49.740 --> 55:50.480]  I got...
[55:51.380 --> 55:54.960]  I feel like that was a 90 second explanation.
[55:55.320 --> 55:57.220]  Do you want us to make these episodes shorter, Geoff?
[55:57.420 --> 56:03.040]  Oh, the f***ing ghost guy in the road with his four minute story about having an ear infection.
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.440]  I was there for all of that, Geoff.
[56:05.780 --> 56:09.720]  You can't give me 90 seconds to answer a question you asked me.
[56:10.040 --> 56:11.220]  I didn't bring up the Ians.
[56:11.500 --> 56:12.440]  You asked it.
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.660]  I'm not any happier about it than you are, Andrew.
[56:14.860 --> 56:15.500]  I'm f***ing...
[56:15.500 --> 56:16.580]  I'm also annoyed.
[56:16.880 --> 56:19.060]  I still don't know what the goddamn Ians are.
[56:19.060 --> 56:20.740]  I know that there was a Garfield tournament.
[56:20.980 --> 56:24.840]  And I know that the f***face community is nicer than the Ian community.
[56:25.060 --> 56:27.740]  And that they had a baby or they merged or something.
[56:28.200 --> 56:28.780]  But I don't remember.
[56:28.820 --> 56:29.380]  I don't know why.
[56:29.500 --> 56:30.860]  And then you abandon Ian.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.260]  And then that Ian's not allowed to be your friend on Twitter or something.
[56:34.740 --> 56:37.620]  Andrew, he doesn't talk to you all week.
[56:37.720 --> 56:39.280]  He listens to you one time.
[56:39.660 --> 56:42.960]  I just lost the plot when you were explaining the Ian part.
[56:43.120 --> 56:43.560]  That's all.
[56:43.680 --> 56:45.900]  It wasn't a depth plot is the problem.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.880]  If it was complicated, there weren't layers.
[56:47.880 --> 56:50.120]  I'll go back and listen to the episode later.
[56:50.360 --> 56:51.760]  You're not going to that.
[56:51.940 --> 56:52.600]  No way.
[56:53.120 --> 56:54.180]  Gavin, why are they named Ian?
[56:54.360 --> 56:55.400]  Why are they called Ian?
[56:55.660 --> 56:56.120]  Don't tell him.
[56:56.240 --> 56:57.580]  It's already been explained.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.100]  We don't need to do this.
[56:59.380 --> 57:01.540]  Yeah, I feel like that's on you now, Geoff.
[57:01.660 --> 57:02.420]  Yeah, I agree.
[57:02.980 --> 57:04.480]  Listen, I'm not mad at Andrew.
[57:04.620 --> 57:05.800]  I don't think he did anything wrong.
[57:05.900 --> 57:10.300]  I'm mad at myself and my goddamn inability to pay attention long enough.
[57:10.460 --> 57:11.720]  I was lost in my head.
[57:11.800 --> 57:12.940]  I was thinking about other stuff.
[57:13.120 --> 57:14.400]  Were you getting pushed over slowly?
[57:14.600 --> 57:15.180]  Is that what was happening?
[57:15.940 --> 57:16.720]  No, I wasn't.
[57:16.720 --> 57:18.820]  What were you thinking about, if I may ask?
[57:20.940 --> 57:22.600]  I don't know.
[57:22.840 --> 57:23.120]  Great.
[57:23.740 --> 57:29.240]  I distinctly remember at one point going,
[57:29.520 --> 57:34.920]  oh shit, I think he just explained the Ian thing and I dropped that.
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.580]  I wonder if I can figure it out from context clues as the rest of the explanation goes.
[57:39.940 --> 57:43.440]  And then I tried, I paid double attention for the second half.
[57:43.640 --> 57:44.820]  I just missed the first part.
[57:44.820 --> 57:49.080]  But then you were thinking about paying attention over the top of actually paying attention.
[57:49.420 --> 57:51.720]  It's like sometimes when you're listening to a podcast or something,
[57:51.840 --> 57:55.560]  but you get a message or you read something at the same time and you don't take it in.
[57:55.640 --> 57:57.080]  So then you wind it back.
[57:57.180 --> 57:59.720]  But then you do the same thing again that makes you miss it again.
[57:59.820 --> 58:00.700]  And it's like, oh, forget it.
[58:00.900 --> 58:01.280]  All the time.
[58:01.440 --> 58:02.720]  Yeah, that's essentially what happened.
[58:02.980 --> 58:05.080]  And it's not Andrew's fault in any way whatsoever.
[58:05.260 --> 58:07.620]  I accept responsibility for my addled brain.
[58:08.020 --> 58:09.060]  Are you offended, Andrew?
[58:09.200 --> 58:09.860]  You offended by that?
[58:10.080 --> 58:10.860]  No, I'm not offended.
[58:11.200 --> 58:14.100]  If he's taking responsibility, I have no issue with that.
[58:14.100 --> 58:14.840]  It was just funny.
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.180]  It's also a very self-explanatory explanation for the name, which makes it funnier.
[58:19.320 --> 58:20.260]  Yeah, it's very simple.
[58:20.380 --> 58:21.540]  Yeah, not complicated at all.
[58:21.860 --> 58:23.440]  So going back to the beginning of the episode,
[58:23.600 --> 58:26.180]  Geoff, uh, Eric said that he has the judges ruling.
[58:26.400 --> 58:27.360]  Oh, yeah, we should do that.
[58:27.700 --> 58:27.840]  Fuck!
[58:28.220 --> 58:29.140]  Okay, sure.
[58:29.340 --> 58:30.240]  Why did you yell fuck?
[58:30.360 --> 58:31.320]  Because is this the end?
[58:31.360 --> 58:33.380]  Because I have a really good f*** face.
[58:33.620 --> 58:36.020]  I mean, we can just do it can just be a long episode.
[58:36.260 --> 58:39.380]  It's just like it's up to Geoff because we have two sponsors.
[58:39.580 --> 58:42.060]  So if these are going to be nine minute sponsor reads, you know.
[58:42.180 --> 58:44.020]  I can get this story done in like two minutes.
[58:44.020 --> 58:44.780]  It's a short one.
[58:44.900 --> 58:45.900]  It's just it's a great.
[58:46.060 --> 58:46.660]  It's a wonderful.
[58:47.020 --> 58:50.360]  I feel like it encapsulates the show perfectly.
[58:50.520 --> 58:54.980]  Can I, by the way, before we go any further, I would like to hear.
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.240]  I would I would absolutely like to hear this story and I'd like to hear the judges ruling.
[58:59.580 --> 59:03.460]  But I'd like to address the nine minute ad read comment by Eric.
[59:03.660 --> 59:06.700]  I don't set out to do nine minute ad reads.
[59:07.060 --> 59:12.920]  What happens is usually on Tuesday, Nick will text me or slack me in a panic,
[59:12.920 --> 59:15.740]  in a tizzy and say like, hey, can you can you do these ad reads?
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.240]  This one is more important.
[59:18.840 --> 59:20.960]  I need them as soon as you can get them.
[59:21.040 --> 59:26.100]  And I go, OK, and then I sit down and very rarely are they in any kind of usable format.
[59:26.180 --> 59:27.360]  And that's not an indictment, Nick.
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.400]  That's not a I don't blame Nick for that.
[59:29.420 --> 59:30.860]  But I get bullet points sometimes.
[59:31.320 --> 59:32.780]  And then I'll say, like, is there a script?
[59:32.820 --> 59:34.280]  And he goes, not really this time.
[59:34.320 --> 59:36.140]  They just you just kind of make it up as you go.
[59:36.540 --> 59:42.220]  So then I just hit record and then I say everything on the paper and I try to make myself laugh.
[59:42.220 --> 59:47.360]  I say everything on the paper one way and then I say it again when I try to write a joke for it or something.
[59:47.520 --> 59:50.380]  And then I give him like, I don't know, a 30 minute file.
[59:50.760 --> 59:54.720]  I assume he can cut that down into 30 seconds or a minute or whatever he needs to.
[59:54.940 --> 59:57.280]  If these ads end up coming in at five, six, seven minutes,
[59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.220]  I can only assume it's because they're very good and they're very funny.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.880]  And there's too much good stuff to lose.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.600]  Can't trim gold.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.080]  Do you guys think this was supposed to make the episode shorter or?
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.280]  I will say, and in defense of you, Geoff, I left.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:17.840]  I mentally left six words into that story and came back eight words on the back eight.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.140]  I have no idea what you said, but the ad reads, right?
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:21.900]  They're long.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.280]  Yeah.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:22.660]  Editing.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.280]  You got the, you got the gist of it.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:24.600]  Okay.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.620]  What's the back eight?
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.340]  Like the back eight words, I'd say.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.580]  I'd say I left on the first six, came back back eight.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.120]  Isn't that meant to be like a golf reference with the back nine?
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.380]  Well, it wasn't a reference.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.300]  It was just, I was trying to measure words.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.520]  Like it's kind of weird.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.400]  I didn't know how long he spoke for, but I could kind of say like.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.280]  I just thought golf courses in Canada were different.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.900]  I, anyway, I don't set out to make these ad reads long.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.160]  My point being, Nick makes them long because he doesn't edit them down more.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.040]  I don't set out to hit a double every time I'm up to the plate.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.320]  Sometimes I just hit doubles.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.080]  Would you prefer I hit a single?
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.180]  At least on a double, I'm in scoring position.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.360]  I'd prefer a home run every time, but if I'm getting doubles effort,
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.800]  then I guess that's what we're getting.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.720]  Dude, I'm fucking 45 years old.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.600]  I don't have a lot of dingers left in me.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.300]  Andrew, tell me about how you f*** faced yourself.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.280]  Thank you, Derek.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.680]  It's a great transition by you.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.600]  So I'm going to pay extra attention to I'm going to hear this whole story.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.280]  It's pretty simple one.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.600]  I think last week I brought up the fact that I have two Slack accounts.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.320]  Yeah, Andrew Panton and not Andrew Panton.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.680]  Yeah, I just switched it to not Andrew Panton recently.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.200]  So I made one in 2017.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.440]  Forgot I did it.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.500]  There's a f*** face channel on Slack for us.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.540]  And the other one was in there.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.520]  And I wasn't.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.600]  And nobody realized for like a month.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.120]  It took a month to figure this out.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.780]  I had other messages on that Slack account.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.860]  One of the messages.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.320]  Just let me pull it up.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.000]  Read it word for word from a name I didn't recognize.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.200]  I had two messages from them.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.300]  I thought it was odd.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.840]  So I looked into it.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.140]  And the first message is this was sent on September 3rd.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.340]  I saw this September 11th when we recorded.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.500]  Hi, Andrew.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.800]  Um, blank.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.220]  I'm on the e-com team.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.440]  Would it be possible if we could get one of your f*** face mistakes hats?
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.400]  There are pretty high demand for it.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.480]  And we would love to replicate it and put it on the store.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.540]  They sent that one day after I started not the Rooster Teeth store.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.780]  I talked so much s***.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.880]  From the time the store opened to like a week later when I finally saw this.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.180]  I felt so bad.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.420]  I was talking s*** every day.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.700]  Every chance I could.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.540]  On Twitter, like everywhere public.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.840]  And they're wondering like, man, he's not only talking s***.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.360]  He's not even he's ignoring us too.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.780]  I'm ignoring them.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:42.000]  Their perception was that I was probably this huge a**hole who didn't want these hats.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.080]  But yet kept yelling about making these hats on Twitter, even though they want them.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.760]  They were waiting for me the whole time.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.440]  I was just screaming constantly about it.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.620]  I had in my notes.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.480]  I mean, who would have thought I'd make two Andy Dufresne references in one episode of f*** face.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.380]  But I had in my notes the day we recorded bring up the Andy Dufresne method,
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.680]  rally the community to message the store at least once a week demanding the hats
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.560]  until they break and are willing to make them with no concept of they've wanted them for over a week.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.760]  And I haven't sent them.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.560]  They actually sent two messages.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.740]  They sent another one that was like, hey, just following up.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]  Hope you're doing well.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.140]  Oh no.
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.120]  Can we please get one of those hats?
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.820]  Like they're so friendly.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.500]  And I felt terrible.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:30.620]  So not only are the f***ed up f*** face hats a complete f*** face in their creation,
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.220]  but the making of them also couldn't be more of a f*** face.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.740]  And you turned us against them too.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.100]  Like we're here wondering, like, man, why aren't they making this clearly a high demand?
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:39.820]  What's going on?
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.620]  In my defense, Eric said they were going to email me.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.880]  So I never even considered a slack as an option.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.080]  I was expecting an email.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.340]  How many emails do you have, though?
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.180]  You want the real answer?
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.860]  But the real answer, like emails I use regularly, two.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.500]  No, three emails.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.600]  I just generally have probably 18.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.600]  What?
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.020]  No, actually, probably like 23.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.840]  23 email accounts?
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.180]  Yeah, I think I probably have 23 email accounts.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.400]  For what?
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:13.600]  Sometimes you need to email a show about trellises and you need to be ready for when that day comes.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:14.280]  Yeah.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.880]  Do you think this is the longest?
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.400]  By the way, I heard that entire story.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:18.940]  Me too.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:19.200]  Great.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.940]  I was hanging on your every word.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.820]  I didn't drop any of it.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.760]  I heard the front six.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.100]  I heard the middle 2,000 and the back eight.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.160]  I got the whole thing.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.220]  I was enraptured by your storytelling ability and your prowess is unmatched.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.880]  And I just wanted to say it was a great story.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.020]  And thank you for that.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.800]  If we want to make this short, we could always cut the shit at the beginning about me being early.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.280]  I think that's the best stuff.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.700]  What I was going to ask is, are we trying to cut this shorter?
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.640]  Or should this just be the longest episode of F*** Face we've ever done?
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.980]  We haven't even had the judges ruling.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.360]  Yeah, we haven't had the judges ruling yet.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.960]  And also, if Eric's worried about the ads being too short, I can make them longer.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.740]  Why would I be worried about the ads being too short?
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.500]  When did I say, man, I sure am worried about the ads being too short?
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.520]  Well, it sounds like you just said it.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.400]  And if you give me 30 minutes with Adobe Audition, I can present that to you.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.500]  That's gonna say it.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.400]  Okay.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.400]  Tell us about what happened.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.920]  Yeah, the judges ruling.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:24.680]  Okay, so it is difficult to get a judge to do a ruling on a podcast called F*** Face.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:29.400]  Most judges do not have senses of humor, as I have come to find out.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.440]  They don't think it's funny that you've asked them to do something.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.220]  They don't want to settle your bet.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.520]  Well, we're paying though, aren't we?
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.500]  Yes, and that doesn't seem to matter.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.920]  We paid a judge?
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:39.520]  Yeah.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.740]  What was the hourly cost?
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.840]  I can't tell you. A gentleman does not reveal numbers.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.880]  However, through great effort...
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.900]  Did you hire LegalZoom?
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:49.740]  No.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:06:00.980]  Working with Gus found a website where you can hire a judge for different rulings
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.960]  and things like that.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:09.560]  And so I have actually not one, not two, but three judges rulings
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:14.460]  that are all about a minute to a minute and a half long.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:17.160]  So I don't want to sit here and make you guys listen to every...
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.160]  unless you really want to, you know, listen to every word of all of these rulings.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.280]  But I think you'll get the idea of kind of where they're all going
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.860]  when I play you the first one.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:28.960]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.020]  Here's the first.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.120]  Okay. Hello, this is Shaheen Davari.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.800]  I'm from Hired Judge.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.740]  I also was an attorney for three years and went to law school.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:42.200]  And so I'd like to start by saying at the very top
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:47.880]  that it is patently obvious to anybody who both listens to the podcast
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:54.800]  and understands the scenario that Andrew should, in fact, have to eat a pencil.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.660]  First, he made the agreement and made the bet.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.460]  And I want to say that up top because there was some type of backtracking
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.720]  that Andrew was trying to pretend that truth isn't truth and it wasn't really him.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.680]  But truth is truth, my friend.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.520]  It was clearly your voice and it was recorded.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.820]  And that evidence definitely weighed heavily on the decision here today.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:25.080]  Second, the crackpot legal defense team did not do their job enough to get paid.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.720]  So I really hope that you did not pay these people.
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:33.180]  Saying that you didn't properly define a term in the contract
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.700]  isn't necessary in oral agreement contracts.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.640]  And it's not necessary in contracts.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:46.560]  What's necessary in a contract is an understanding between the parties as to what the pencil is.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.940]  You both understood what you meant by pencil.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.880]  No lead. You don't want any lead.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:51.900]  You don't want someone to get poisoned.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.620]  Graphite pencils are perfectly harmless to eat in very small amounts, meaning one pencil.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:04.420]  And so buck up and eat the fucking pencil.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.200]  I was okay with that ruling until the very end.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.160]  And also no judge says buck up.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.260]  This judge did.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.280]  I'm accepting of the ruling. I have some questions though.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.580]  I want to get drinks with that guy.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.980]  I got an erection.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.440]  Okay.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.120]  Can you believe the part that got me was when he talked about an oral agreement
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.320]  and that you both understood what a pencil was.
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.000]  And it's like, that's exactly right.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.720]  These guys went above and beyond.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.840]  Like I explained to them what was going on and gave them pieces of evidence.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.800]  They listened to like whole episodes.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:36.820]  Oh no.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.820]  That's what I said.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.780]  I'm like, no, don't do that.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:41.220]  Oh no.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.320]  They listened to whole episodes.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.400]  They got back to me in like a day.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.360]  This hiredjudge.com.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.540]  They got back to me in like a day.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.440]  I worked with this guy, Blake.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.380]  He was fucking awesome.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.740]  They like really went above and beyond.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.900]  All three of them said, Andrew has to eat the pencil.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.100]  This is incredible.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.620]  I'm blown away by that.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:59.600]  I don't know what I was expecting.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.960]  That exceeded everything.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:01.620]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.120]  That was phenomenal.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.320]  That was what complicated...
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.800]  When you guys were like, how could you have a trial with no judge?
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.480]  Eric kind of told me that was the direction he was going to go in.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.640]  That was always going to be the case.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.820]  There's never going to be a judge.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.480]  It was a tough thing to defend though.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.820]  That stepping on the amazing bit.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.240]  I can't believe you got three.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.520]  This was really impressive.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:17.920]  Yeah.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.760]  I have two more if you guys want to hear them or we can just insert them into the show later.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  But I'll be honest.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.020]  If you'd have told me when we were recording episode one of F*** Face,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.680]  if you'd have played me that clip that you just played,
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.520]  I would have absolutely no idea how we got there.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.000]  I would never in a million years been able to piece that together.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.040]  In only 16 episodes.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:37.820]  What a journey.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.120]  Yeah.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.780]  And also as a side product of a burger related issue.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.920]  Like the pencil thing was a burger thing.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.120]  I will accept the ruling.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.980]  And now that this is kind of over, I'll be open about my intent.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.900]  I absolutely said I would eat a pencil.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.860]  I didn't think I did at the time.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.640]  When you first brought it up, Gavin, I genuinely didn't think I said that.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.100]  But then I talked to some of my friends who listened to the show.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.040]  And I said, yeah, can you believe Gavin said that?
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.660]  I thought he thinks that I said I would eat a pencil if I lost the bet.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.740]  And they all universally agreed.
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.900]  They're all like, oh yeah, you absolutely said that.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.840]  The thing is, is that I wonder if you were sort of jeffing it.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.700]  Because even though I was saying that to you,
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.980]  you never acknowledged the pencil part in the bet.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.480]  You just kept talking around and asking about other things to the point where
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.880]  technically you never even really, you never agreed on it with me.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.380]  He did.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.420]  I feel like I probably did.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.120]  I summarized it and we were, and both agreed that you were on the same page.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.480]  He definitely did eventually.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.440]  I didn't remember it at the time.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.160]  And then you, that night, Gavin texted Geoff and I audio clips of me agreeing.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.080]  And I felt I had no choice but to just claim that that was not my voice.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.380]  It was the most ridiculous explanation I could come up with.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.740]  And thus we had a trial.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:58.780]  It was the most fucking frustratingly hilarious wall I've been presented with.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:02.480]  Which was you just refusing to acknowledge the naked truth.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.100]  We just couldn't push through the wall. It was impossible. Like nothing we said mattered.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:11.480]  It's just like, kudos. The Trump defense worked very well. Up to the very end.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.840]  I was not going for a Trump defense, but I will say it was sort of horrifying,
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.080]  even though the legal team didn't work out.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.780]  Being transparent to them and saying like, I absolutely did this, get me out of it.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:26.520]  And then seeing the minds of like people that have even a grasp of how the law works
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.220]  working together to get me out of a thing I absolutely committed to was horrifying,
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.620]  but also fascinating. It was weird.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.320]  This was a great learning experience from beginning to end, I think.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:36.540]  Yeah.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.640]  I think we've done good work overall.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.800]  I agree. I mean, it got a little aggressive, but I feel like that was all for the fun of it.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.560]  At least in my end.
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:47.700]  I know we paid those judges. So, you know, fucking congratulations.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.160]  You got your cold hard cash, but also like, thank you.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.040]  That was like, they went above and beyond. That was really cool to have our little debate,
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:04.920]  our little argument get presided upon by not one, not two, but three like crackpot judges.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.040]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.040]  I don't think you know what crackpot means.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:16.200]  I meant to say like, I said crackpot. I meant to say like a crack team of three judges.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.160]  I said crackpot. I was thinking about myself.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.020]  You made it sound like Eric found them in an asylum or something.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.240]  Yeah. Now I've insulted our judges.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.660]  No, I love that they exist and I love that we have access to them now.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:30.080]  And I just, I can't wait for other stuff.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.040]  I have a rapport now. I'm, I'm working with Blake closely.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.320]  He says that he likes the, after listening to this stuff, he likes the show.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:41.940]  Uh, so I don't know, like he's really into it.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:46.120]  So I told him that if we have other stuff that we have to settle across any of these other podcasts,
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.800]  we'll be going, uh, with higher judge so they can help us out.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.960]  That reminds me, I think I actually know what went wrong in my defense.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.660]  I made a critical error. I'm going to blame Eric for this.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.600]  This is Eric's fault. It really, it was my downfall.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:03.900]  After we recorded, when we agreed that we would be having a trial,
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.400]  Eric jokingly sent me a Fiverr link to a wizard
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.480]  that said they knew how to cast a win a court spell.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.460]  Win a trial spell, I believe was the wording, which I promptly got.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.620]  I paid for my spell. Still haven't gotten it yet.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.600]  But I feel like just trying to get a court spell, bad voodoo.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.100]  I think I kind of jinxed myself. I think there's no scenario in which I win.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.320]  The wizard failed me. I guess don't trust wizards is my kind of general point.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.920]  That reminds me, Andrew, you and I were going to do that whole thing where we,
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.200]  we used magic to bet on the NBA.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.920]  Yes, I told Eric that when Eric presented me this, I was like,
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.200]  oh yeah, this is a path that Geoff and I have explored in the past.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.400]  This is the thing we considered.
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.140]  We still got to get, we got to get back on that in the new season.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:51.880]  I agree.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.540]  Do you think we should go back to double recordings?
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.940]  I feel like we've always got way too much stuff for a single recording.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:13:59.840]  This is a weird one.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.060]  This is a weird one. And then also I can't record at the normal time next Thursday.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.380]  I don't know if you saw Eric, but I hit no on the invite.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:07.640]  Yeah, I saw.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.360]  Yeah. Cause I got, it's a, I got a round 36 of the root canal.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.780]  We'll find another day and another time. It's fine.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.920]  There's not a trial anymore. We have it settled.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.560]  We just have to see Andrew eat a pencil now.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.900]  There's not a trial anymore, but we do have three judges on the hook waiting for the next one,
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:24.520]  which is exciting.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.700]  I'm slightly worried about the, what the next week holds for Andrew,
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.100]  because at the time of this recording, the previous episode is yet to come out.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.220]  And that's the one where he sort of...
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.180]  Oh, it's going to be fun.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.140]  Minged up the entire court case.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.220]  Oh, I'm excited. It's going to be great.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.340]  Get ready for the storm.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.780]  People are going to be furious.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.200]  Oh yeah.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.920]  Just know that I love you, Andrew.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.220]  Oh, I appreciate that.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:53.660]  That's what was so funny was listening to two weeks ago's episode when I proposed the trial.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.100]  That was just me like putting my toes into the heel water.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.320]  That was just like a little dip in being a bad guy on purpose.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.020]  And people were like, he's the biggest bitch in the world.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.220]  And I was just laughing like they've got no fucking clue what's going to happen next week.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.420]  They're going to hate it.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.040]  Gavin, Andrew texted me, I want to say yesterday at 7am Texas time.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.020]  So it would have been 5am Canada time.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.260]  He texted me and just said, I've Greg Millard myself.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.140]  I kind of forget the whole world doesn't understand wrestling.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.820]  If you don't know who Greg Miller is, he's a popular video game entertainer,
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.920]  kind of like us, who is the perfect heel as it were.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.420]  But the first like Rooster Teeth content he did, he went full heel.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.920]  Yeah, no other context.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.620]  And then people hated him because they didn't understand what a heel was.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.800]  Yeah, I Greg Millard myself.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.080]  I wouldn't feel without thinking if people know what a heel is.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.400]  We should probably wrap this up.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.800]  Yeah. Hey, thanks for listening to another.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.100]  This episode 16 of F*** Face.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:53.900]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.200]  This was the legal episode.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:02.040]  And thank you to Andrew and Gavin for continued hilarity.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.500]  And Eric for doing the bare minimum.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.480]  And Nick, you're great.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.920]  And I'll go ahead and say it.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.240]  Bare minimum, he got a judge.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.800]  Yeah, I know this is...
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.680]  Congratulations to...
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.480]  Eric did a great job.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.360]  To me...
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.580]  Nick always does a great job.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.360]  Great job, Geoff.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.360]  I mean, you zoned out.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:15.800]  You did well.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.060]  I don't know if you get a great shot.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.280]  Like a 6.5 out of 10.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.480]  That was a first successful story arc.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.620]  I think we should all be very proud of what we've done.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:23.920]  Yeah.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:24.980]  Is that the first one?
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.120]  I mean, that was like a three act story.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:27.760]  Yeah.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.940]  Until we're on the podcast talking about how the bathtub boat race went.
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:32.740]  Probably, yeah.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.500]  I also have to get back to basket weaving.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.840]  Something I've been meaning to do.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.160]  There's... Andrew and I were talking about this the other day, Gav.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:45.660]  Like the world building and the lore of F*** Face for a podcast that's only 16, 18 episodes long.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.300]  It's dense already.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.620]  I thought you don't talk to Andrew in the week anymore.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.720]  No, we found a kind of middle.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.140]  Yeah, it's hard with the playoffs, Gav.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.660]  Like he's the only person I know that I talk about sports with.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:01.580]  Sometimes Eric will text me at night and he'll just be like,
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.580]  how about them Celtics?
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.020]  Or Kawhi's a bitch or whatever.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.700]  And I'll be like, yeah, and I'll talk to him for a second.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:09.440]  But if I'm going to talk about sports, it's got to be with Andrew.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.400]  And so, yeah, there's a truce, as it were.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.600]  The last message from Eric is thanks for listening.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.940]  Rate five stars and subscribe.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.220]  End the episode.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.480]  What are you doing?
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.320]  Thanks, man.
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.240]  Thanks for listening.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.760]  Rate five stars and subscribe.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:30.300]  Oh, and also, dear Boston Celtics, do not F*** Face yourselves tonight again.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:37.020]  Game one was the biggest professional sports F*** Face I have seen in a long time.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.440]  And I had no patience.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.020]  I had no f***ing patience to watch that nonsense happen again.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.300]  So let's not F*** Face ourselves out of the goddamn Eastern Conference finals.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.240]  Eric brings up a great point.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:54.740]  And the results of that round will be completely determined by the time anyone hears this.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.540]  Two weeks old.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.060]  Yeah.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:56.600]  Yeah.
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.180]  Well, I'm mad about it now.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:58.880]  I agree.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.980]  With ads, this is going to be 90 minutes.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.860]  They're calling it the greatest block in playoffs history.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.080]  I don't know about that.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.580]  Which is a little excessive.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.720]  Eric, you're going to have to...
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.600]  I've never seen worse clock management.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:13.940]  You're going to have to step in, Eric.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.140]  Oh, I don't want to talk s*** about my beautiful Celtics or any individual.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:18.920]  Eric, help.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.080]  God bless them all.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.380]  But it was rough.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:23.220]  It was rough.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.100]  Thanks for listening to this episode of F*** Face.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:26.280]  Rate five stars and subscribe.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.240]  And don't forget to check out the f*** hat shirt that's red.
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.380]  It's the red f*** hat shirt.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.620]  Go check it out on the store.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.920]  And you can click the link below.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.820]  We'll see you next time for F*** Face.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.340]  Do you have one, Eric?
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.120]  I'm not done yet.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:36.680]  Do you have that shirt?
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.060]  I'm not done yet.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.260]  No, no, they haven't sent them yet.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.040]  For Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, and Andrew Panton, we'll see you next time on F*** Face.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.780]  What are you going to have for dinner tonight, Eric?
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:47.860]  Jesus Christ.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.880]  Can you imagine drawing up a play where you just stand still, dribble for 10 seconds?
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:52.540]  Oh, s***!
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.720]  That's a great question.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.080]  Andrew...
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:55.540]  End this!
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.860]  Okay, sure, just a second.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.700]  Andrew, have you watched the HBO show Hard Knocks?
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.000]  Yeah, yeah, I watch it every year.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.180]  I've never seen it. That's a great show.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.080]  How early do you show up to a basketball game?
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.220]  Oh, I show up 45 minutes early.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.020]  Yeah, you want to be very early for a sporting event.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:10.880]  Very early.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.680]  Because, A, you want to... I don't know if everybody does this, but I like to walk the
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.940]  length of the arena, you know, because it's a circle.
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.160]  So you want to see where everybody's sitting, where it is.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.180]  You go, you immediately find your spot, right?
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.800]  You go in, make sure everything's good there.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.340]  Then you walk around, you survey all the food, you figure out the very best place to
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:29.560]  eat.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.140]  Then you go get that food.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:35.540]  Then you sit down and you watch Shootaround and, like, pregame warm-ups.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.040]  And then by the time the game starts, you already have pissed, you've eaten, and you're
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:41.780]  ready for basketball.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.020]  Do you ever watch Road to the Winter Classic, Geoff?
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:44.820]  I don't know what that is.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.160]  What is that?
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.020]  It's like Hard Knocks, but hockey.
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:47.440]  What the fuck?
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.140]  What is going on?
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:48.420]  Stop.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:49.280]  Stop.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.540]  Have you... Eric, have you seen Hard Knocks?
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.860]  It's about the Chargers this year.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.560]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.680]  Yeah, I hate the Chargers.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.900]  Yeah, I don't like them anymore.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.440]  Do you like the Rams?
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.080]  No.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.240]  Who do you like in the football?
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.080]  I like Red Zone.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:00.940]  Eric, what are you doing?
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.800]  Red Zone is a great...
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.000]  I'm trying to get this to end.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.920]  I figure if I answer these questions curtly, it'll be over.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.160]  Hard Knocks, it's all about... it's crazy.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.000]  I assume that there are other seasons, but this season, it's all...
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.100]  There's so many seasons.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.740]  Oh, yeah, dude, but it's all about COVID.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:20.120]  It's all about Corona and, like, how they're restarting the NFL in the pandemic.
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:20.860]  It's fascinating.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.280]  I would say that this was a weaker season, Geoff.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.520]  You can make a new voice channel.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.520]  If you enjoyed this one...
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.420]  Is it over already?
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.800]  Yeah, it's over.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:33.840]  Also, Amazon has a football show where they do during the season, which is also very good.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.360]  Oh, I would love to see that too.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.480]  Gavin, if you just end your audio recording, that has to be the end of the episode.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.000]  Oh, there's another voice audio channel come up.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.160]  Are we still going?
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:43.840]  Let's stop.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.220]  I don't know.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480]  I think we should end the podcast.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.440]  Jesus Christ.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.420]  Hey, thanks for listening to F*** Face.
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.620]  Go ahead and like and subscribe and tell a friend.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860]  We love you.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.120]  We already did that.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.380]  No, he did it.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:54.800]  I didn't.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.740]  I thought we ended already.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.160]  Well, you might have to cut this one down.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.240]  All right, that's the end.
