[00:00.000 --> 00:01.980]  At Chipotle, we also have a playlist.
[00:02.800 --> 00:04.440]  Guacamole as it's being hand-mashed.
[00:04.860 --> 00:06.660]  The sizzle of adobo chicken on the grill.
[00:07.240 --> 00:08.760]  The chopping of onions and cilantro.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.320]  We call our playlist...
[00:11.000 --> 00:11.240]  Real.
[00:11.900 --> 00:14.380]  Order now. Chipotle. For Real.
[00:26.490 --> 00:28.370]  So, we start recording at 4.
[00:28.650 --> 00:31.230]  Andrew said let's record at 3.50 as a funny joke.
[00:31.350 --> 00:32.250]  I got here at 3.40.
[00:32.450 --> 00:35.330]  That's what you do. Here's what's fucking great about this.
[00:35.610 --> 00:36.570]  We're all here
[00:36.570 --> 00:39.430]  10 minutes before we're supposed to be because we all thought the same thing.
[00:39.430 --> 00:41.930]  I was so convinced that you were gonna be here
[00:41.930 --> 00:43.690]  and go, I thought you were 10 minutes early to everything.
[00:43.890 --> 00:45.890]  When I said get here 10 minutes early, that means
[00:45.890 --> 00:48.050]  it was on time. So, if you're really 10 minutes
[00:48.050 --> 00:49.630]  early to everything, you would have been 10 minutes early
[00:49.630 --> 00:51.990]  to the 10 minutes early. So, I just fucking got here
[00:51.990 --> 00:53.350]  30 minutes early to be safe.
[00:53.870 --> 00:55.990]  Well, I'm already rolling. We don't have to
[00:55.990 --> 00:57.190]  start, but I've already begun.
[00:57.470 --> 00:59.530]  Yeah, I'm rolling too. We just finished
[00:59.530 --> 01:01.710]  face jam, so we're like...
[01:01.710 --> 01:04.210]  I'm coming down off a food coma. What did you guys eat today?
[01:05.190 --> 01:05.910]  Wendy's has
[01:05.910 --> 01:07.770]  the pretzel pub bacon
[01:07.770 --> 01:10.210]  cheeseburger and pretzel pub
[01:10.210 --> 01:11.810]  chicken sandwich
[01:11.810 --> 01:13.710]  and it is a lot.
[01:13.890 --> 01:16.090]  It's a lot of food. And I have like a headache.
[01:16.290 --> 01:17.110]  I don't feel very good.
[01:17.450 --> 01:20.090]  We also got frostachinos. What's a frostachino?
[01:20.790 --> 01:22.130]  Is that like a frosty
[01:22.130 --> 01:24.330]  cappuccino? Like they put coffee
[01:24.330 --> 01:26.170]  and a frosty
[01:26.170 --> 01:28.270]  in one cup and then you drink
[01:28.270 --> 01:29.430]  it because you're a pig human.
[01:30.710 --> 01:31.230]  Yeah.
[01:32.470 --> 01:34.050]  Now, I don't want
[01:34.050 --> 01:35.990]  to give the impression that I don't listen to
[01:35.990 --> 01:37.890]  face jam. Obviously, I do
[01:37.890 --> 01:39.890]  religiously. Right, of course. But for people
[01:39.890 --> 01:41.990]  who may be listening to F*** Face, who may not
[01:41.990 --> 01:43.390]  listen to our podcast, Face Jam,
[01:44.450 --> 01:46.070]  and why would you? Andrew and I are not in it.
[01:46.190 --> 01:47.850]  But assuming that we're even
[01:47.850 --> 01:50.010]  starting this podcast, do you guys keep
[01:50.010 --> 01:51.830]  a record of your caloric
[01:51.830 --> 01:53.710]  intake per episode? No.
[01:53.970 --> 01:55.270]  I think that would make us all feel
[01:55.830 --> 01:57.130]  worse than we already feel.
[01:57.850 --> 01:59.830]  Like there's no benefit to it. I think it'd be
[01:59.830 --> 02:02.110]  an interesting stat to keep. Well, the audience could do that
[02:02.110 --> 02:03.830]  if they really wanted. Because I imagine
[02:03.830 --> 02:05.650]  everything you just described to me
[02:05.650 --> 02:07.950]  it sounded like 3500
[02:07.950 --> 02:09.870]  calories. Yeah, we ate a whole
[02:09.870 --> 02:11.910]  cheeseburger, we ate a whole chicken
[02:11.910 --> 02:14.010]  sandwich, we ate small fries,
[02:14.530 --> 02:15.530]  and a frost-a-cino
[02:16.210 --> 02:18.050]  which is just a frosty mixed
[02:18.050 --> 02:19.790]  with ice coffee. Like I
[02:19.790 --> 02:21.610]  legitimately have like a headache from
[02:21.610 --> 02:23.650]  like the sodium that I've eaten.
[02:23.830 --> 02:25.510]  Like I don't feel good. I feel bad.
[02:25.630 --> 02:28.030]  Did you say a coffee mixed with an ice coffee?
[02:28.230 --> 02:30.250]  No, I'm sorry. A coffee mixed with a frosty.
[02:30.470 --> 02:31.790]  So is that just ice cream
[02:31.790 --> 02:33.450]  and coffee? Yes. Okay.
[02:33.670 --> 02:35.670]  And then they gave it a fun name and then
[02:36.750 --> 02:37.930]  uh... we ordered it.
[02:38.030 --> 02:39.890]  What did you think of the chicken
[02:39.890 --> 02:41.870]  pub sandwich? Because I had one
[02:41.870 --> 02:44.070]  myself. Oh, did you? Oh, I'd be interested
[02:44.070 --> 02:45.950]  to hear your opinions. Which is good
[02:45.950 --> 02:47.870]  because I don't rate the food on the show. I just
[02:47.870 --> 02:49.670]  make sure they do. Uh, I
[02:50.250 --> 02:51.910]  fucking loved it. I thought it was
[02:51.910 --> 02:54.030]  really good. I thought it was like
[02:54.030 --> 02:55.910]  I don't like pickles, so I picked those
[02:55.910 --> 02:57.710]  pickles off, but I liked everything else about it.
[02:57.770 --> 02:59.990]  What is it you don't like about pickles? I like pickled
[02:59.990 --> 03:01.810]  things. I like pickled onions.
[03:02.090 --> 03:04.050]  I like pickled jalapenos and stuff like that.
[03:04.190 --> 03:06.010]  The pickles themselves are a
[03:06.010 --> 03:07.590]  weird in-between of like
[03:07.590 --> 03:10.150]  this is briny and salty
[03:10.150 --> 03:11.690]  but crunchy
[03:11.690 --> 03:13.470]  but soft, but
[03:13.790 --> 03:15.950]  it's like there's too- it's not any
[03:15.950 --> 03:17.510]  specific kind of thing.
[03:17.750 --> 03:19.870]  I just don't like the flavor at all. But I like cucumbers.
[03:20.170 --> 03:21.850]  I just don't like pickles. Okay. I've never
[03:21.850 --> 03:23.890]  knowingly had a pickle in my life.
[03:24.130 --> 03:26.230]  So I avoid pickles. But I did
[03:26.730 --> 03:28.090]  accidentally bite into a pickle
[03:28.750 --> 03:30.310]  yesterday, biting into that sandwich.
[03:30.610 --> 03:31.590]  I might like pickles.
[03:32.590 --> 03:34.170]  I'm on the fence about it. I don't know.
[03:34.250 --> 03:36.070]  I'm too scared to go further, but
[03:36.070 --> 03:38.110]  I think I might like pickles. I think they might
[03:38.110 --> 03:40.010]  be okay. This is how you learned?
[03:40.250 --> 03:42.030]  Yeah, because typically they only
[03:42.030 --> 03:44.230]  put two pickles on a thing like that.
[03:44.410 --> 03:45.730]  So I took the two pickles off.
[03:45.930 --> 03:47.730]  There was a third rogue pickle
[03:47.730 --> 03:49.730]  hidden underneath an onion ring piece.
[03:50.050 --> 03:52.010]  Bit into it. I thought, that's an unusual
[03:52.010 --> 03:53.750]  crunch. I don't recognize that crunch.
[03:54.050 --> 03:55.990]  Oh, there was a hidden third pickle. That
[03:55.990 --> 03:57.510]  wasn't that bad. Maybe I like pickles.
[03:57.670 --> 04:00.090]  I don't know. I haven't decided yet. What did you do with
[04:00.090 --> 04:01.370]  the other half of the pickle?
[04:01.650 --> 04:03.870]  I just took it off immediately. What? But I didn't
[04:03.870 --> 04:05.670]  mind it. I thought it was okay. Wait.
[04:05.990 --> 04:07.950]  I'm so confused. I feel like this is
[04:07.950 --> 04:09.930]  very straightforward. You took a bite of the
[04:09.930 --> 04:12.070]  sandwich. It had a pickle on it.
[04:12.510 --> 04:14.090]  You ate it. You said,
[04:14.410 --> 04:15.870]  oh, that was okay. I
[04:15.870 --> 04:17.890]  might like pickles. And then
[04:18.530 --> 04:19.910]  instead of taking another
[04:19.910 --> 04:22.010]  bite with the other half of the pickle,
[04:22.330 --> 04:24.030]  you took it off
[04:24.030 --> 04:26.010]  even though you were okay with it.
[04:26.190 --> 04:27.990]  Yeah, because I don't know if I like pickles or not.
[04:28.070 --> 04:29.230]  I'm still on the fence about it.
[04:30.390 --> 04:31.990]  Does that not seem like the opportunity
[04:31.990 --> 04:34.050]  that you were looking for? To test a
[04:34.050 --> 04:36.030]  theory? You were on the cusp!
[04:36.370 --> 04:38.170]  You were there! Yeah, but
[04:38.170 --> 04:40.010]  I'm not that adventurous, okay? I need to
[04:40.010 --> 04:41.890]  mentally prepare myself for Pickle Day,
[04:41.970 --> 04:44.050]  and I was not ready for it. I was just there
[04:44.050 --> 04:45.510]  for the sandwich. Classic sandwich.
[04:45.930 --> 04:48.050]  I took the pickle off because I was aware it was there.
[04:48.310 --> 04:50.050]  If I went whole pickle, this could be...
[04:50.050 --> 04:51.770]  I could be the biggest pickle guy in the planet
[04:51.770 --> 04:53.450]  if I accidentally went full pickle
[04:53.450 --> 04:56.030]  yesterday, but we're still on the fence about it.
[04:56.090 --> 04:57.770]  You just described this as
[04:57.770 --> 04:59.330]  classic sandwich.
[04:59.510 --> 05:01.770]  Geoff, the food that we are
[05:01.770 --> 05:03.430]  talking about has
[05:03.430 --> 05:06.270]  muenster cheese, beer cheese,
[05:06.710 --> 05:07.690]  onion rings,
[05:08.150 --> 05:10.030]  like, what are you talking about?
[05:10.630 --> 05:12.130]  Classic sandwich.
[05:13.330 --> 05:15.370]  Okay, bog standard,
[05:15.630 --> 05:17.850]  typical classic American
[05:17.850 --> 05:19.930]  sandwich. Everyone knows
[05:19.930 --> 05:21.830]  there's like a two pickle limit
[05:21.830 --> 05:24.050]  to a sandwich. What? If you're getting it from a fast
[05:24.050 --> 05:25.610]  food restaurant. If you're getting it from a fast food restaurant,
[05:25.730 --> 05:27.950]  at home, totally different game, there's a
[05:27.950 --> 05:30.210]  two pickle cap that is typically there
[05:30.210 --> 05:31.810]  unless you're having like the pickle burger
[05:31.810 --> 05:33.850]  and there's a million pickles. It's a two pickle
[05:33.850 --> 05:35.770]  average. So I didn't expect the third pickle.
[05:35.910 --> 05:37.950]  Hey Geoff? Yeah? Do you appreciate
[05:37.950 --> 05:39.870]  being dictated how many pickles are the
[05:39.870 --> 05:41.810]  average from a man who doesn't like pickles
[05:41.810 --> 05:43.810]  or maybe doesn't like pickles or picks
[05:43.810 --> 05:45.870]  the pickles off? As somebody who
[05:45.870 --> 05:47.630]  takes the pickles off constantly,
[05:47.630 --> 05:49.470]  I feel like I am a very
[05:49.470 --> 05:51.850]  qualified person to say this. I see it constantly.
[05:52.110 --> 05:53.430]  As somebody who's confused about his
[05:53.430 --> 05:55.670]  obviously confused about his pickle identity,
[05:55.990 --> 05:57.170]  uh, no, I
[05:58.010 --> 05:59.570]  no offense Andrew, but I don't
[05:59.570 --> 06:01.110]  think you get to be the arbiter of
[06:01.630 --> 06:03.650]  pickle placement. I'm not saying I've set the rules,
[06:03.650 --> 06:05.510]  I'm reporting back on what I've seen.
[06:05.710 --> 06:07.690]  It's typically two pickles. Could be different
[06:07.690 --> 06:09.670]  in Canada too, I don't know man, you guys might have
[06:09.670 --> 06:11.550]  different... That's a good point. There might be
[06:11.550 --> 06:13.670]  a pickle law up there, there might be
[06:13.670 --> 06:15.630]  a pickle lobby. It's like a metric kind
[06:15.630 --> 06:17.910]  of thing. Yeah, yeah, there could be a conversion
[06:17.910 --> 06:19.410]  rate, that's, yeah.
[06:19.650 --> 06:21.270]  McDonald's is totally different in Canada.
[06:21.550 --> 06:23.750]  Like, it blew my mind that you guys don't have
[06:23.750 --> 06:25.270]  muffins. It's madness to me.
[06:26.550 --> 06:27.670]  One of my favorite
[06:27.670 --> 06:29.530]  McDonald's items my entire life has been
[06:29.530 --> 06:31.190]  their carrot muffin. It's fantastic.
[06:31.290 --> 06:33.510]  What the fuck? Yeah, I love the
[06:33.510 --> 06:35.330]  muffins. Carrot muffin is something you get at
[06:35.330 --> 06:37.550]  Starbucks. No, you get it from McDonald's
[06:37.550 --> 06:39.430]  here. They have like a whole bakery, we got
[06:39.430 --> 06:41.190]  croissants, we got donuts,
[06:41.730 --> 06:43.830]  it's crazy. They don't allow carrots
[06:43.830 --> 06:45.570]  in McDonald's? Oh yeah, they do.
[06:45.810 --> 06:47.790]  And they put them in muffins. What the hell?
[06:48.310 --> 06:49.930]  Geoff, look at this. I just put it in the
[06:49.930 --> 06:52.050]  look at this thing. Hold on. It's delicious.
[06:52.410 --> 06:53.550]  Is this for real? Yeah.
[06:53.750 --> 06:56.010]  Holy shit! I brought it up casually to somebody
[06:56.010 --> 06:57.990]  and it never occurred to me that that was
[06:57.990 --> 06:59.690]  a Canada thing. They have a whole bakery.
[07:00.030 --> 07:01.810]  The Canadian McDonald's menu is way
[07:01.810 --> 07:04.070]  superior than the American menu. McCafe?
[07:04.410 --> 07:05.750]  Man, McFuck America
[07:05.750 --> 07:07.990]  apparently. Yeah. Jesus. I want a carrot
[07:07.990 --> 07:09.970]  muffin. You see their logo
[07:09.970 --> 07:12.030]  is the red box
[07:12.030 --> 07:13.950]  with the M and then there's a little
[07:13.950 --> 07:15.610]  like maple leaf in it?
[07:15.950 --> 07:17.330]  Yeah, I see that. That's
[07:17.750 --> 07:19.030]  real subtle, Canada.
[07:19.710 --> 07:21.890]  Good muffins. If you're ever in Canada...
[07:21.890 --> 07:24.070]  Can I ask you a question? Yeah, go ahead. Are you guys known
[07:24.070 --> 07:26.090]  for your carrots? Is that a thing you grow
[07:26.090 --> 07:27.890]  in Canada? Is that like
[07:27.890 --> 07:29.870]  it's like, yeah, it's like mousse
[07:29.870 --> 07:31.930]  and maple syrup and carrots.
[07:32.050 --> 07:34.050]  Everybody knows that. That's a great question. I will
[07:34.050 --> 07:36.010]  say I've personally tried to grow carrots
[07:36.010 --> 07:38.050]  two times in my life and it has never
[07:38.050 --> 07:39.970]  turned out. So I'm gonna say no.
[07:39.970 --> 07:41.730]  Just based on personal experience.
[07:41.990 --> 07:44.110]  Do Canadians just love carrots to the point
[07:44.110 --> 07:45.750]  where they're like, we need a carrot muffin.
[07:45.790 --> 07:48.070]  I think you're really focused in on the fact we have
[07:48.070 --> 07:49.850]  carrots. We have all types of muffins.
[07:50.090 --> 07:51.950]  We got muffins all over the place. There's like 10
[07:51.950 --> 07:54.230]  different flavors of muffins. We got croissants.
[07:54.490 --> 07:56.030]  We got donuts. We have all
[07:56.030 --> 07:57.950]  sorts of pastries. Yeah, in America we have
[07:57.950 --> 07:58.790]  Dunkin' Donuts.
[08:00.450 --> 08:01.790]  I don't have that.
[08:02.090 --> 08:04.030]  I got a McDonald's. We have a whole
[08:04.030 --> 08:05.510]  other store for that shit, dude.
[08:05.730 --> 08:07.930]  What about chicken balls? Has anyone here heard
[08:07.930 --> 08:08.570]  of a chicken ball?
[08:09.390 --> 08:11.810]  What? No? Okay.
[08:12.210 --> 08:13.950]  Once again, it's another thing my whole
[08:13.950 --> 08:15.810]  life. Chicken balls, go-to Chinese
[08:15.810 --> 08:17.870]  takeout item. And I was thinking about it
[08:17.870 --> 08:20.030]  of like, that's a really unappetizing name
[08:20.030 --> 08:21.730]  for a dish. Chicken balls.
[08:21.930 --> 08:23.890]  And I brought it up to someone. They had no idea
[08:23.890 --> 08:25.910]  what I was talking about. Let's hear it. What's a
[08:25.910 --> 08:28.030]  chicken ball? It's just like, it's like a chicken
[08:28.030 --> 08:29.950]  nugget. But it's a Chinese chicken nugget.
[08:30.190 --> 08:31.950]  It's the piece of chicken
[08:31.950 --> 08:33.890]  and it's circular and it's
[08:33.890 --> 08:35.990]  covered in batter. It's just a chicken nugget, essentially.
[08:35.990 --> 08:38.090]  Why is it called a Chinese chicken nugget?
[08:38.330 --> 08:40.170]  Well, I'm just saying it's a Chinese chicken nugget
[08:40.170 --> 08:42.110]  because it's called a chicken ball. It's not actually
[08:42.110 --> 08:44.010]  called a Chinese chicken nugget. It's, I mean, it's
[08:44.010 --> 08:45.950]  not Chinese at all. It's a Chinese
[08:45.950 --> 08:47.890]  restaurant item. I see.
[08:48.070 --> 08:49.990]  You don't just go to any restaurant and order chicken. Yeah,
[08:50.050 --> 08:52.110]  that is a classic chicken ball right there.
[08:54.170 --> 08:56.190]  And I guess it's because they kind of look like
[08:56.190 --> 08:57.990]  balls, which is also...
[08:58.910 --> 09:00.050]  But not chicken, like chicken
[09:00.050 --> 09:01.990]  balls, chickens do not have balls
[09:01.990 --> 09:03.870]  that look like that, I don't think.
[09:03.870 --> 09:05.950]  Do they not? I'm pretty confident. I mean, I've never
[09:05.950 --> 09:07.930]  checked, but I'm pretty sure. One thing
[09:07.930 --> 09:09.930]  we do know about chickens is that
[09:09.930 --> 09:11.530]  they don't excrete their urine
[09:11.530 --> 09:13.850]  and their shit through their skin. That is
[09:13.850 --> 09:15.850]  true. We definitely know that.
[09:16.250 --> 09:18.050]  Roosters have testicles, two bean
[09:18.050 --> 09:19.870]  shaped testes located against their
[09:19.870 --> 09:21.510]  backbone in the front of their kidneys.
[09:21.770 --> 09:23.290]  Okay, but they don't look like that.
[09:23.530 --> 09:25.490]  There's not a rooster...
[09:25.490 --> 09:28.030]  Not in scale. There's no way.
[09:28.150 --> 09:29.930]  How's your average chicken ball taste?
[09:30.330 --> 09:32.010]  I mean, it tastes like an average...
[09:32.010 --> 09:34.250]  I mean, you've had lemon chicken, right?
[09:34.670 --> 09:36.110]  Yeah. And I'm assuming lemon chicken
[09:36.110 --> 09:38.190]  is just like the same type of batter, but it's just
[09:38.190 --> 09:39.950]  like flat and cut into pieces?
[09:40.230 --> 09:41.550]  It tastes like that, but it's circular.
[09:41.770 --> 09:44.250]  Well, I tell you what, when we come
[09:44.250 --> 09:46.190]  up for the yearly bathtub race,
[09:46.290 --> 09:48.490]  we're gonna eat chicken balls
[09:48.490 --> 09:50.270]  and carrot muffins in the
[09:50.270 --> 09:51.790]  bathtub while we race.
[09:51.930 --> 09:53.830]  That's gonna be our race fuel.
[09:54.130 --> 09:56.150]  I like it. Can we try eggs, too?
[09:56.250 --> 09:58.290]  I've never intentionally had an egg.
[09:58.610 --> 10:00.370]  What? I'm not an egg guy.
[10:00.730 --> 10:02.590]  I fucking poisoned my girlfriend
[10:02.590 --> 10:03.910]  the other day with bad eggs.
[10:06.270 --> 10:08.590]  I didn't even know that, but see, I've avoided
[10:08.590 --> 10:10.590]  that my whole life. It's not a worry for me.
[10:10.950 --> 10:12.490]  I gave her food poisoning
[10:12.490 --> 10:14.110]  and she threw up like crazy.
[10:15.350 --> 10:15.710]  Oh...
[10:15.710 --> 10:18.630]  I make real good eggs, Andrew. I'll make you some eggs.
[10:18.950 --> 10:20.750]  Oh, that's great. What type of eggs?
[10:21.010 --> 10:22.530]  I'll make sure that they're not expired
[10:22.910 --> 10:24.010]  this time. Awesome.
[10:24.370 --> 10:26.150]  Nah, dude, like, she woke me up the other day.
[10:26.190 --> 10:27.970]  It was like a Saturday morning. She woke me up and she goes,
[10:27.970 --> 10:30.150]  Hey, would you make me the scrambled eggs
[10:30.150 --> 10:31.250]  you always make?
[10:31.490 --> 10:33.690]  I know that it's
[10:33.690 --> 10:35.870]  Saturday morning and you're probably asleep, but I'm
[10:35.870 --> 10:38.070]  just craving them. And you know, when a pretty blonde
[10:38.070 --> 10:39.310]  lady asks you to do anything,
[10:39.890 --> 10:41.890]  you do it. And so I got up and I just
[10:41.890 --> 10:43.830]  ran into the kitchen and I grabbed the eggs and I
[10:43.830 --> 10:45.770]  cooked them and I made some beautiful scrambled
[10:45.770 --> 10:47.830]  eggs and I gave them to her and she ate them and she made a weird
[10:47.830 --> 10:49.850]  face. And then I thought, Are they okay?
[10:49.890 --> 10:51.410]  And she goes, Yeah, they're good. They're good.
[10:51.690 --> 10:53.810]  And then two hours later, she was
[10:53.810 --> 10:55.950]  in Bathroom City and we checked
[10:55.950 --> 10:58.050]  and the eggs had been expired for a while.
[10:58.230 --> 11:00.170]  Oh no! How much did she
[11:00.170 --> 11:01.910]  eat? Uh, I made her four
[11:01.910 --> 11:03.090]  eggs. Jesus!
[11:03.830 --> 11:05.830]  Did she eat all of it? Uh, I don't know.
[11:05.930 --> 11:07.930]  I didn't, like, check her plate, but I'm
[11:07.930 --> 11:10.270]  assuming she ate a good chunk of it. That's brave.
[11:10.610 --> 11:12.010]  And when you can taste something is
[11:12.010 --> 11:13.810]  off, to go the entire way
[11:13.810 --> 11:15.510]  is quite the statement. Well, you know,
[11:15.770 --> 11:17.890]  I don't know. I think
[11:17.890 --> 11:19.750]  she trusted me a little too much, unfortunately.
[11:20.150 --> 11:21.670]  First time I tried to make
[11:21.670 --> 11:23.970]  chicken parmesan, I didn't know you had to
[11:23.970 --> 11:25.750]  cook the chicken in a pan first.
[11:25.950 --> 11:27.750]  I thought you just put it in an oven.
[11:28.070 --> 11:29.150]  And so I
[11:29.950 --> 11:31.930]  coated it, and I put the cheese
[11:31.930 --> 11:34.030]  on it, and then I threw it in an oven
[11:34.030 --> 11:35.930]  for, like, 25-30 minutes
[11:35.930 --> 11:38.250]  until it, like, kind of looked brown.
[11:38.590 --> 11:40.090]  And I ate about half
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.250]  of a raw chicken breast.
[11:41.830 --> 11:43.650]  And I realized immediately,
[11:43.830 --> 11:46.230]  the texture in this just doesn't
[11:46.230 --> 11:48.190]  taste right, but I made it about halfway
[11:48.190 --> 11:50.010]  before I decided to stop. That's why
[11:50.010 --> 11:52.070]  I was interested to see if she ate the plate
[11:52.070 --> 11:53.610]  or not, despite the weird taste.
[11:53.930 --> 11:55.470]  Yeah, I think she probably ate most of it.
[11:56.590 --> 11:57.930]  But, uh... Hey, is this
[11:58.630 --> 11:59.650]  what this show is?
[11:59.870 --> 12:01.610]  No, no, no. This has been the
[12:01.610 --> 12:03.750]  F*** Face Jam collaboration
[12:04.230 --> 12:06.210]  that everybody's been whining about on social media.
[12:06.310 --> 12:07.850]  There you go, you just had it. You had some
[12:07.850 --> 12:09.710]  of F*** Face, and you had some of Face Jam.
[12:09.890 --> 12:12.090]  Yeah, we talked about food and how it fucks you up.
[12:12.230 --> 12:13.710]  That works for me. Works for me, too.
[12:14.030 --> 12:15.890]  Totally unintentional, but I realized about
[12:15.890 --> 12:17.990]  five minutes in that that's where this was headed, so...
[12:17.990 --> 12:19.250]  Yeah, really. Let's just
[12:20.090 --> 12:21.430]  embrace that, and say
[12:21.430 --> 12:23.390]  that that was intentional, and that's what that was.
[12:23.670 --> 12:25.630]  Should I try milk? What? What did you say?
[12:25.790 --> 12:27.170]  No, no, no, no. No. Milk is
[12:27.170 --> 12:28.870]  f***ing gross, dude. Don't try milk. Okay.
[12:29.050 --> 12:30.950]  People try to tell you... How old are you? 26?
[12:31.830 --> 12:33.090]  Yes. Yeah. You're
[12:33.090 --> 12:35.450]  far too long in the tooth to worry about milk.
[12:35.670 --> 12:37.070]  Your bones are your bones.
[12:37.510 --> 12:39.170]  Your teeth are your teeth. Your hair is your hair.
[12:39.310 --> 12:41.230]  Milk ain't helping at this point, so don't worry
[12:41.230 --> 12:43.390]  about it. It's f***ing gross. The milk is a hair thing?
[12:43.650 --> 12:45.370]  I think so, right? Strong bones
[12:45.370 --> 12:47.070]  and a healthy smile, and...
[12:47.070 --> 12:49.050]  Where does the bones come into
[12:49.050 --> 12:51.090]  the hair? I've never heard silky coat
[12:51.090 --> 12:52.590]  bones. Maybe I'm thinking of
[12:53.050 --> 12:54.910]  eggshells to a dog. I don't know, but
[12:54.910 --> 12:57.030]  it probably doesn't hurt your hair. What are
[12:57.030 --> 12:59.110]  you talking about? If you feed a
[12:59.110 --> 13:01.010]  dog eggshells, it's supposed to give it a silky coat.
[13:01.110 --> 13:02.930]  How did my confession of
[13:02.930 --> 13:04.930]  I've never tried milk end up with you
[13:04.930 --> 13:06.910]  being the weird one? That was great. I didn't
[13:06.910 --> 13:09.010]  predict that at all. I went off on a tangent, and
[13:09.010 --> 13:11.110]  that's where we ended up. The point being,
[13:11.170 --> 13:13.030]  I don't think you should try milk. Because here's
[13:13.030 --> 13:15.030]  the thing, too. What kind of milk are you gonna
[13:15.030 --> 13:16.730]  try? It's gotten out of hand.
[13:16.950 --> 13:18.930]  Yeah, there's the 2%. When I was
[13:18.930 --> 13:20.610]  growing up, you had 2%,
[13:20.610 --> 13:22.870]  skim milk, and whole milk.
[13:22.990 --> 13:24.850]  And that was pretty much it. But now,
[13:25.230 --> 13:26.930]  there's like a 1% in there,
[13:27.030 --> 13:28.590]  and then you've got, like, oat milk,
[13:28.810 --> 13:30.770]  you've got soy milk, you've got
[13:30.770 --> 13:32.550]  almond milk, you've got
[13:32.550 --> 13:34.630]  fucking alpaca milk, you've got
[13:34.630 --> 13:36.650]  Eric milk. I don't know. Point is,
[13:36.810 --> 13:38.870]  where do you even go with it anymore? You don't just get,
[13:38.970 --> 13:40.790]  like, don't bother. But oat milk,
[13:41.010 --> 13:42.810]  don't you think that's kind of using a term
[13:42.810 --> 13:44.870]  liberally there? Like, milk? Like, isn't
[13:44.870 --> 13:46.790]  it just juice? I don't know. I've never
[13:46.790 --> 13:48.590]  had it, and I don't know what the process is.
[13:48.770 --> 13:50.770]  But I mean, like, that's what it's like. Almond milk is
[13:50.770 --> 13:52.290]  the same thing, isn't it? Like, you
[13:52.850 --> 13:54.970]  can't milk an almond. You're not pulling
[13:54.970 --> 13:56.850]  on the almond udder to get
[13:56.850 --> 13:58.670]  the milk. I understand. Yeah.
[13:58.790 --> 14:00.750]  I feel like I heard almond milk is, like,
[14:00.810 --> 14:02.790]  terrible for the environment. The amount of water
[14:02.790 --> 14:04.830]  you need to make almond milk, I feel like
[14:04.830 --> 14:06.750]  is absurd. Yeah, you're 100%
[14:06.750 --> 14:08.790]  correct. Almond milk is bad for the environment.
[14:08.910 --> 14:10.970]  And I think soy milk is not great in large
[14:10.970 --> 14:12.910]  quantities for you, so...
[14:12.910 --> 14:14.870]  Maybe I just go chocolate, maybe? Is that, like,
[14:14.910 --> 14:16.950]  the kiddie pool of the milk game? That how
[14:16.950 --> 14:19.070]  I get in? Just get my toes wet? Have you
[14:19.070 --> 14:20.710]  never had chocolate milk? No.
[14:20.890 --> 14:22.910]  I think it's overrated, but you
[14:22.910 --> 14:24.850]  should give it a shot at some point. Okay.
[14:25.070 --> 14:27.050]  What do you think, Eric? I think chocolate milk is good
[14:27.050 --> 14:28.910]  and you can try it, but I don't think you're gonna
[14:28.910 --> 14:31.050]  be blunt. I think for you, it's not gonna be chocolaty
[14:31.050 --> 14:32.830]  enough to warrant having the drink
[14:32.830 --> 14:35.050]  itself. Totally agree. I think you're just gonna be like,
[14:35.110 --> 14:36.930]  well, this is just kind of, like, chocolate-esque
[14:37.270 --> 14:38.910]  drink. I'm not a big chocolate
[14:38.910 --> 14:40.670]  fan, so I don't know if that would phase me.
[14:40.910 --> 14:42.990]  I don't need a lot of chocolate. That's kind
[14:42.990 --> 14:44.830]  of my deal, too. Like, it
[14:44.830 --> 14:46.710]  just tastes like really... yeah, I don't know.
[14:46.950 --> 14:49.090]  I'm not crazy about chocolate milk. I will probably
[14:49.090 --> 14:50.690]  go the rest of my life
[14:50.690 --> 14:52.610]  and never have chocolate milk again. Yeah.
[14:52.810 --> 14:54.830]  And that's just fine. Totally fine. Nothing wrong with that.
[14:54.990 --> 14:57.050]  Hey, can I go... I know that we're deep into the
[14:57.050 --> 14:58.610]  part two of F*** Face Jam, apparently,
[14:58.790 --> 15:00.830]  already. Can I go off on a
[15:00.830 --> 15:02.930]  tangent, if y'all don't mind?
[15:03.050 --> 15:04.890]  Please. Go ahead. So, this
[15:04.890 --> 15:06.930]  all just happened. As I was getting here 30 minutes
[15:06.930 --> 15:08.370]  early to get here 10 minutes early...
[15:08.930 --> 15:09.250]  Uh...
[15:12.050 --> 15:13.010]  I was
[15:13.010 --> 15:15.050]  thinking about that bit
[15:15.050 --> 15:16.890]  they do in Curb Your Enthusiasm
[15:16.890 --> 15:19.010]  where Richard Lewis and Larry
[15:19.010 --> 15:21.110]  always go out to lunch and Richard gets there
[15:21.110 --> 15:22.950]  early. He'll get there to the restaurant
[15:22.950 --> 15:24.530]  like an hour or two hours early.
[15:24.670 --> 15:26.610]  And I can't remember if it's to pay the bill
[15:26.610 --> 15:28.730]  or if it's to get the better
[15:28.730 --> 15:30.510]  table, like the better seat at the table.
[15:30.910 --> 15:33.110]  And it might be both at different seasons.
[15:33.230 --> 15:34.970]  But it got me thinking about Richard
[15:34.970 --> 15:36.970]  Lewis. And the first thing I think about when I think
[15:36.970 --> 15:39.010]  about Richard Lewis is how he
[15:39.010 --> 15:40.770]  looks kind of like a human skeleton.
[15:40.770 --> 15:43.010]  And I'm not trying to be rude or mean
[15:43.010 --> 15:45.010]  to Richard Lewis at all. It's just like his face
[15:45.010 --> 15:47.070]  is like... it's just like... it's bony
[15:47.070 --> 15:49.090]  in a weird way. And that got me thinking
[15:49.090 --> 15:50.750]  about how he and
[15:51.410 --> 15:52.970]  Jamie Lee Curtis used to
[15:52.970 --> 15:55.250]  be in a sitcom together that I f***ing loved
[15:55.250 --> 15:56.910]  when I was a kid called Anything
[15:56.910 --> 15:58.930]  But Love. I don't know if any of you guys are
[15:58.930 --> 16:01.050]  familiar with that show or know what I'm talking about. No clue.
[16:01.210 --> 16:03.010]  Nope. Okay. It was on for like three or four
[16:03.010 --> 16:04.950]  seasons. It was very much like
[16:04.950 --> 16:07.090]  mad about you. It was... they were like on
[16:07.090 --> 16:08.850]  again, off again, like a romantic thing.
[16:09.330 --> 16:10.950]  Bam. I found this... here's the
[16:10.950 --> 16:12.950]  photo of them. I'm gonna
[16:12.950 --> 16:15.070]  put it up in the slack. Here's a photo of them
[16:15.070 --> 16:17.050]  from the show. The first thing you'll
[16:17.050 --> 16:19.070]  notice is that because it was
[16:19.070 --> 16:20.650]  the early 90s, I think it was like
[16:20.650 --> 16:22.950]  89 to 93 or something, they have
[16:22.950 --> 16:24.870]  the exact same hairstyle, which is f***ing
[16:24.870 --> 16:27.230]  hilarious. Is this the podcast? Oh, hey, what's up?
[16:27.370 --> 16:28.690]  Yeah, hey, Gavin. Why'd you
[16:28.690 --> 16:30.890]  start without me? I'm not late. No, we're... you know,
[16:31.430 --> 16:32.790]  we... Geoff was there. I showed up
[16:32.790 --> 16:34.910]  ten minutes early, as I usually do, and
[16:35.290 --> 16:36.870]  you know, we just figured we'd
[16:36.870 --> 16:38.950]  start. This is what I'm talking about with the early thing.
[16:39.030 --> 16:40.990]  Now I'm gonna start feeling pressure not to arrive
[16:40.990 --> 16:42.970]  at like 3.50. It
[16:44.010 --> 16:44.930]  really turned into
[16:44.930 --> 16:46.890]  a whole... it is a whole thing. Bang on
[16:46.890 --> 16:48.990]  time, and I'm late. No, you're not late at all.
[16:49.130 --> 16:50.810]  I am late. You've already started. No,
[16:50.970 --> 16:52.750]  well, we were just here, so we
[16:52.750 --> 16:54.530]  started, but you're not late. You're on time.
[16:55.030 --> 16:56.870]  You're actually early, technically. Weren't you like
[16:56.870 --> 16:58.650]  two minutes early? I was like
[16:58.650 --> 17:00.570]  maybe 90 seconds early.
[17:00.710 --> 17:02.730]  Yeah. Which is on time. Yeah. No, you were
[17:02.730 --> 17:04.670]  totally fine. Not today, I wasn't. No.
[17:04.930 --> 17:06.730]  What was funny, Gavin, is
[17:06.730 --> 17:08.730]  this kind of backfired in its own
[17:08.730 --> 17:10.730]  way. As I said over the weekend
[17:10.730 --> 17:12.610]  to Geoff and Eric, we
[17:12.610 --> 17:14.450]  should show up ten minutes early
[17:14.450 --> 17:16.290]  and start the show ten minutes early
[17:16.290 --> 17:18.530]  because of the whole conversation last week.
[17:18.890 --> 17:20.510]  Geoff showed up twenty or thirty
[17:20.510 --> 17:22.690]  minutes early, cause he thought that
[17:22.690 --> 17:24.690]  it was gonna be a bit where he was then
[17:24.690 --> 17:26.570]  gonna be late to the ten minutes early
[17:26.570 --> 17:28.630]  version of the show, and I came in
[17:28.630 --> 17:30.550]  to Geoff and Eric talking, and
[17:30.550 --> 17:32.550]  I also thought that I had then screwed
[17:32.550 --> 17:34.530]  myself and they had started before I got
[17:34.530 --> 17:36.550]  there. Cause I was ten minutes early. When did this
[17:36.550 --> 17:38.570]  actually start? Uh, twenty or
[17:38.570 --> 17:40.790]  thirty minutes ago. We're twenty minutes in.
[17:41.490 --> 17:42.190]  To the episode?
[17:42.610 --> 17:44.630]  Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Well
[17:44.630 --> 17:46.650]  damn! Why am I
[17:46.650 --> 17:48.490]  even, should I even be on it? No,
[17:48.570 --> 17:50.550]  absolutely! I've already missed half of it. Come on in.
[17:50.570 --> 17:51.990]  No! We're talking about Richard Lewis.
[17:52.370 --> 17:54.650]  So, you see that picture of Richard Lewis
[17:54.650 --> 17:56.770]  and Jamie Lee Curtis. They have the same
[17:56.770 --> 17:58.630]  haircut, right? Which is hilarious in itself.
[17:58.810 --> 18:00.970]  But that's Richard Lewis that I think about
[18:00.970 --> 18:02.750]  as a kid. And now
[18:02.750 --> 18:04.650]  below that is Richard Lewis today.
[18:05.010 --> 18:06.350]  And my point being,
[18:06.530 --> 18:08.410]  fucking age is
[18:08.410 --> 18:10.830]  unfair. He was a really
[18:10.830 --> 18:12.750]  like, eight-nineties good
[18:12.750 --> 18:14.710]  looking guy. And it hasn't been
[18:14.710 --> 18:16.670]  that long. Look at what just a
[18:16.670 --> 18:18.950]  few years has done to that poor man.
[18:19.070 --> 18:20.710]  Looking what he's like, putting his
[18:20.710 --> 18:22.630]  hair through though, I feel like he did himself no
[18:22.630 --> 18:24.670]  favors. Like, when you have excellent hair
[18:24.670 --> 18:26.630]  in your youth, I feel like you're destroying
[18:26.630 --> 18:28.490]  it for later. Oh, it's the worst.
[18:28.710 --> 18:30.850]  Yeah. Lots of product, it's kind of long,
[18:31.130 --> 18:32.810]  it's like mullety. What year
[18:32.810 --> 18:34.670]  was the top photo from? 89
[18:34.670 --> 18:36.710]  to 92, somewhere in there. That was a
[18:36.710 --> 18:38.510]  long fucking time ago. That wasn't-
[18:38.510 --> 18:40.690]  Not to me! That wasn't like five years.
[18:40.990 --> 18:42.710]  That was a long time. Look at Jamie Lee
[18:42.710 --> 18:44.430]  Curtis now. She still looks really good.
[18:44.650 --> 18:46.670]  Yeah, I mean she looks the same old
[18:46.670 --> 18:48.730]  though. No, I mean they both have grey hair,
[18:48.950 --> 18:51.030]  but look at his face and skin.
[18:51.030 --> 18:53.050]  It's just also a bad
[18:53.050 --> 18:55.010]  photo though, he's kind of like- Yeah, you
[18:55.010 --> 18:57.170]  did pick a terrible Richard Lewis
[18:57.170 --> 18:59.090]  photo. That's the first photo
[18:59.090 --> 19:00.870]  that came up when I googled Richard Lewis.
[19:01.110 --> 19:03.150]  That's like him eating lunch. That's
[19:03.150 --> 19:04.550]  his photo from Wikipedia!
[19:05.030 --> 19:06.750]  That's him eating lunch and someone
[19:06.750 --> 19:09.150]  walked in and went, Richard! Dude, it's his photo
[19:09.150 --> 19:11.230]  from Wikipedia! He doesn't put that on there!
[19:11.690 --> 19:12.810]  Wikipedia's not him.
[19:13.070 --> 19:15.210]  Alright, find me a good Richard Lewis photo
[19:15.210 --> 19:17.070]  now. Well, that's the challenge, I wasn't prepared
[19:17.070 --> 19:19.070]  for this. Can we call him? Do you have his
[19:19.070 --> 19:21.130]  number? Here, here's another one. This is him
[19:21.130 --> 19:23.470]  in a fucking tux. Okay, that's
[19:23.470 --> 19:25.050]  yeah, he... is he
[19:25.050 --> 19:27.110]  how- well... This is gonna happen
[19:27.110 --> 19:29.170]  to us. Yeah. Gavin, this is gonna be
[19:29.170 --> 19:31.170]  you tomorrow. Dude, I got
[19:31.170 --> 19:32.990]  a horrible tweet
[19:32.990 --> 19:34.970]  the other- did I tell you about this?
[19:35.230 --> 19:37.170]  So I tweeted about how I found a new
[19:37.170 --> 19:38.130]  dent in my head.
[19:39.770 --> 19:41.190]  Because it's like distracting
[19:41.190 --> 19:43.010]  me every time I walk past the mirror. I'm like, why is this
[19:43.010 --> 19:44.890]  dent in my head? And uh,
[19:45.190 --> 19:46.810]  I guess it's new because I keep noticing it.
[19:46.810 --> 19:49.030]  And uh, you know, I expected some funny
[19:49.030 --> 19:50.870]  replies. And a lot of them
[19:50.870 --> 19:52.730]  were funny. They were like, oh, you got hit in the head with a
[19:52.730 --> 19:54.550]  moon ball, lololol. Have you tried like-
[19:54.550 --> 19:56.690]  Yeah, I saw somebody said I did it.
[19:56.830 --> 19:58.770]  Probably. Yeah, have you tried like holding your
[19:58.770 --> 20:00.910]  nose closed and blowing to pop it back out?
[20:00.950 --> 20:02.230]  That kind of thing, that's funny shit.
[20:02.570 --> 20:04.410]  Then this guy wrote
[20:05.650 --> 20:06.690]  It's your frontal
[20:06.690 --> 20:08.630]  eminence growing. I guarantee
[20:08.630 --> 20:10.870]  if you wait, the hair directly above it
[20:10.870 --> 20:12.710]  along your hairline will begin to
[20:12.710 --> 20:14.890]  die off and hairline recede.
[20:14.890 --> 20:16.730]  Not a joke. Not making fun of you.
[20:16.870 --> 20:19.150]  It's just what's happening. It's natural.
[20:20.030 --> 20:20.890]  That's no fun.
[20:21.110 --> 20:22.330]  And that was such a downer!
[20:22.570 --> 20:24.710]  Because now I'm going to be looking at my frontal eminence
[20:24.710 --> 20:26.250]  every time I'm feeling old.
[20:26.650 --> 20:28.590]  I don't even know what that is. Is it like head lumps?
[20:28.770 --> 20:30.370]  What is that? That can't be good.
[20:31.070 --> 20:32.670]  Well yeah, that's an interesting question.
[20:32.950 --> 20:34.470]  Why did the shifting cause baldness?
[20:34.670 --> 20:36.290]  I feel like that's almost a title.
[20:36.610 --> 20:38.110]  Like when it's like, oh, your royal highness.
[20:38.330 --> 20:39.670]  Oh, your frontal eminence.
[20:40.770 --> 20:42.230]  Yeah, it sounds very
[20:43.110 --> 20:43.790]  cultured. Yeah.
[20:43.950 --> 20:45.910]  Dude, I'm sorry about your frontal eminence.
[20:46.090 --> 20:47.990]  Me too, man. I was just figuring
[20:47.990 --> 20:50.790]  maybe you were getting fat around that spot.
[20:50.850 --> 20:52.050]  It'd be weird to put on weight
[20:52.050 --> 20:52.950]  only in the forehead.
[20:55.430 --> 20:56.150]  It's not really.
[20:56.270 --> 20:58.290]  Even if you put on 100 pounds, I feel like
[20:58.710 --> 21:00.130]  there's not more fat
[21:00.130 --> 21:02.110]  under your foreheads again.
[21:02.250 --> 21:04.530]  You get really embarrassed about having to change hat sizes.
[21:05.850 --> 21:06.710]  It's like a belt.
[21:06.810 --> 21:07.690]  You're going up in rungs.
[21:08.470 --> 21:10.210]  I mean, if your head gets fat, it's
[21:10.210 --> 21:11.630]  going to be mainly on the back.
[21:11.870 --> 21:13.850]  Like where your neck meets your back.
[21:14.150 --> 21:15.390]  Oh, where you get the rolls.
[21:15.490 --> 21:16.990]  Yeah, the nice head rolls.
[21:24.390 --> 21:25.530]  Hellman's believes they can
[21:25.530 --> 21:27.570]  turn any mayo hater into a lover.

[22:21.450 --> 22:23.330]  The Twisted Tale of Amanda
[22:23.330 --> 22:24.550]  Knox is on Hulu.
[22:25.190 --> 22:27.210]  In 2007, Amanda Knox
[22:27.210 --> 22:28.530]  was studying abroad in Italy.
[22:29.090 --> 22:31.070]  She had no idea her dream would
[22:31.070 --> 22:32.390]  turn into a nightmare.
[22:32.990 --> 22:34.950]  Inspired by the actual events of her wrongful
[22:34.950 --> 22:37.250]  conviction and 15 year fight for freedom,
[22:37.710 --> 22:39.170]  watch the new Hulu original
[22:39.170 --> 22:41.310]  series, The Twisted Tale of Amanda
[22:41.310 --> 22:43.270]  Knox. Now streaming on Hulu
[22:43.270 --> 22:45.230]  and Hulu on Disney Plus for bundle

[22:49.450 --> 22:51.410]  Do you have a butthole?
[22:51.990 --> 22:52.830]  Go ahead and check.
[22:53.250 --> 22:55.210]  Yeah? Well, then this ad
[22:55.210 --> 22:57.170]  is for you. It's hard to believe that when
[22:57.170 --> 22:58.750]  we go to the bathroom in this country,
[22:59.050 --> 23:00.810]  most of us wipe instead of wash.
[23:01.210 --> 23:03.450]  I mean, it's barbaric.
[23:03.730 --> 23:05.250]  I've been talking about this for a
[23:05.250 --> 23:07.250]  while. I saw the light a few years
[23:07.250 --> 23:09.490]  ago, and I hope you too. Bidets
[23:09.490 --> 23:11.250]  have been available but hideously
[23:11.250 --> 23:13.210]  expensive, costing thousands
[23:13.210 --> 23:14.710]  of dollars, which is...
[23:15.190 --> 23:17.290]  It creates a huge barrier of entry to
[23:17.290 --> 23:19.290]  bum comfort. And that's what we should all
[23:19.290 --> 23:21.470]  be worrying about. The Hello Tushy Modern
[23:21.470 --> 23:23.330]  Bidet Attachment is here to democratize
[23:23.870 --> 23:25.250]  the blessings bestowed by
[23:25.250 --> 23:27.230]  bidets and offer clean buttholes
[23:27.230 --> 23:29.330]  to everyone, not just
[23:29.330 --> 23:31.450]  the culturally and corporate
[23:31.450 --> 23:33.270]  elite. It attaches to your
[23:33.270 --> 23:35.110]  existing toilet, requires no electricity
[23:35.110 --> 23:37.110]  or additional plumbing, and it cuts
[23:37.110 --> 23:39.170]  toilet paper use by 80%.
[23:39.170 --> 23:41.310]  You're gonna walk outside and every tree
[23:41.310 --> 23:42.490]  you see is gonna be like,
[23:42.930 --> 23:45.190]  Hey buddy, good on ya. Really appreciate that.
[23:45.330 --> 23:47.130]  My cousin? My cousin's alive now because
[23:47.130 --> 23:48.810]  of you. So the Hello Tushy Bidet
[23:48.810 --> 23:51.050]  pays for itself in a few months, and
[23:51.050 --> 23:52.410]  it makes you a bunch of new
[23:53.290 --> 23:55.090]  int friends. I don't know if
[23:55.090 --> 23:57.110]  you remember Lord of the Rings, but having the ints on your
[23:57.110 --> 23:58.730]  side is never a bad idea.
[23:59.050 --> 24:00.990]  Because the Hello Tushy, you don't wipe at all.
[24:01.390 --> 24:03.130]  Even the best two-ply can't cut it
[24:03.130 --> 24:05.390]  when it comes to a hands-free poop experience.
[24:05.650 --> 24:07.130]  Hell, even if you double up a
[24:07.130 --> 24:09.290]  two-ply and make it a four-ply. Let's go eight-ply.
[24:09.450 --> 24:10.730]  It's still not gonna be the same thing.
[24:11.010 --> 24:12.990]  If it was rock, paper, scissors,
[24:13.190 --> 24:15.250]  water, water beats paper
[24:15.250 --> 24:17.030]  every time. The Hello Tushy

[24:43.610 --> 24:45.610]  listening to this butthole service announcement.
[24:47.130 --> 24:49.610]  So what did I miss on the first half of
[24:49.610 --> 24:51.630]  F*** Face? Oh, we did a crossover.
[24:51.990 --> 24:53.650]  We did a F*** Face, Face Jam,
[24:53.770 --> 24:55.610]  F*** Face Jam crossover where
[24:55.610 --> 24:57.850]  we talked about McDonald's and
[24:58.470 --> 24:59.930]  Wendy's and pickles
[25:01.210 --> 25:02.010]  and chicken
[25:03.070 --> 25:04.050]  balls. Andrew's never
[25:04.050 --> 25:06.090]  had an egg. He's never had milk.
[25:06.230 --> 25:07.710]  It was a whole thing. Never had an egg.
[25:07.950 --> 25:10.050]  No. Gavin, do they have
[25:10.050 --> 25:11.910]  muffins in McDonald's
[25:11.910 --> 25:13.690]  in England? I mean, I don't know
[25:13.690 --> 25:16.030]  because I've... I don't know if you know this about me
[25:16.030 --> 25:18.010]  with McDonald's. I've only ever ordered a
[25:18.010 --> 25:20.010]  Big Mac and it's now such a
[25:20.010 --> 25:21.970]  long streak in my life that I can't order anything
[25:21.970 --> 25:23.990]  else. So I rarely look at the menu to be
[25:23.990 --> 25:25.950]  honest. Okay. No, that's fair. I'm not gonna
[25:25.950 --> 25:27.870]  argue about that. Yeah. I mean it's kind of
[25:27.870 --> 25:29.870]  notice... I mean, you don't live there anymore. But now
[25:29.870 --> 25:31.810]  it's like there's a f***ing bakery whenever I go
[25:31.810 --> 25:33.510]  into McDonald's. I mean, I would guess yes.
[25:33.850 --> 25:35.650]  I would guess they have all that breakfast stuff.
[25:35.770 --> 25:38.050]  There's no way that Canada's the only place
[25:38.050 --> 25:39.770]  that has a muffin. We don't have that s***
[25:39.770 --> 25:41.750]  in America, buddy. I know you don't. But
[25:41.750 --> 25:43.690]  are you talking about a muffin or a
[25:43.690 --> 25:45.950]  McMuffin? Carrot muffin. A carrot
[25:45.950 --> 25:47.870]  muffin is one of my favorite McDonald's
[25:47.870 --> 25:49.750]  items. I don't think I've ever seen that.
[25:49.890 --> 25:51.910]  Huh. We have fruit. Like you get a bag of
[25:51.910 --> 25:54.050]  fruit. A bag of fruit? What do you mean by a bag
[25:54.050 --> 25:55.910]  of fruit? Bag of cut up apples and
[25:55.910 --> 25:57.570]  s***. But is it like in a
[25:57.570 --> 25:59.850]  container, you mean? I've never seen
[25:59.850 --> 26:01.910]  a bag of fruit. Oh, I mean a bag
[26:01.910 --> 26:04.110]  is a container. A container is not a bag.
[26:04.530 --> 26:05.850]  It contains the fruit.
[26:06.070 --> 26:07.310]  It's like a net is a container.
[26:07.570 --> 26:09.790]  Anything that contains... No! It's a
[26:09.790 --> 26:11.850]  container. There's no way that a
[26:11.850 --> 26:14.090]  container is a bag. Nobody buys
[26:14.090 --> 26:15.330]  doll bags.
[26:15.590 --> 26:18.110]  Or like cut up like fruit bags.
[26:18.330 --> 26:19.850]  It's not a... Like when I think of bag
[26:19.850 --> 26:21.850]  I think of like bag of milk in a bag. Like it's
[26:21.850 --> 26:23.930]  a real bag. Container is not a bag.
[26:23.930 --> 26:25.890]  So to you a container has to have
[26:25.890 --> 26:28.070]  no holes and has to be a solid. It has
[26:28.070 --> 26:30.030]  to have a lid. A bag doesn't have
[26:30.030 --> 26:32.030]  a lid. It has to have a lid. I think a
[26:32.030 --> 26:33.930]  container must have a lid. A ziplock
[26:33.930 --> 26:36.050]  is a lid. A ziplock isn't a lid. It's
[26:36.050 --> 26:38.210]  a lock. A bag with... It's a seal.
[26:38.370 --> 26:39.790]  A lock to a bag
[26:39.790 --> 26:41.690]  is a lid to a box.
[26:42.010 --> 26:44.010]  I don't... You just threw a lot of words at me
[26:44.010 --> 26:45.810]  that I don't know how to untangle and I don't want to
[26:45.810 --> 26:47.930]  trip myself up. But a ziplock is not
[26:47.930 --> 26:50.050]  a container. That's a seal. That's not a lid.
[26:50.130 --> 26:52.030]  What are you doing to the contents?
[26:52.030 --> 26:54.010]  What is the purpose? What are you... It's just
[26:54.010 --> 26:55.770]  two different types of storage.
[26:55.970 --> 26:58.210]  But what is it doing though? What is the bag doing,
[26:58.450 --> 27:00.010]  Andrew? They're both protecting the items
[27:00.010 --> 27:02.150]  on the inside but they're just two different ways to do
[27:02.150 --> 27:04.030]  it. A beanie isn't a fucking hat.
[27:04.250 --> 27:06.070]  Those are two different things that serve the same
[27:06.070 --> 27:07.870]  purpose. A beanie is a hat. Yeah.
[27:08.030 --> 27:09.830]  No it's not. A beanie is like a...
[27:09.830 --> 27:12.090]  A beanie is a... A beanie is not a hat.
[27:12.170 --> 27:14.110]  Nobody looks at a beanie and says that's a hat.
[27:14.230 --> 27:16.170]  It's literally a hat. No it's
[27:16.170 --> 27:17.870]  not. A hat is a hat.
[27:18.150 --> 27:19.690]  Andrew, I think you've got a very
[27:19.690 --> 27:21.670]  very compelling argument here
[27:21.670 --> 27:23.750]  with container versus bag
[27:23.750 --> 27:26.010]  but you are way off base on the hat
[27:26.010 --> 27:27.970]  thing. You're making bad analogies
[27:27.970 --> 27:29.730]  here. I think steer back
[27:29.730 --> 27:31.550]  towards... You're doing really well.
[27:31.690 --> 27:33.770]  I'm very entertained. I don't
[27:33.770 --> 27:35.210]  know which side... Like I honestly
[27:35.210 --> 27:37.550]  I don't know which side I land on.
[27:37.610 --> 27:39.830]  Is it a container, a bag, or not?
[27:39.950 --> 27:41.750]  But you're just digging yourself a
[27:41.750 --> 27:43.490]  grave with the beanie hat thing. I'm gonna...
[27:43.490 --> 27:45.590]  It's like... It doesn't help. I disagree.
[27:45.870 --> 27:47.570]  I think a hat is a hat and a beanie is a beanie.
[27:47.570 --> 27:49.390]  I don't think you need that to prove your point.
[27:49.550 --> 27:51.570]  What's a top hat? A top hat is
[27:51.570 --> 27:53.690]  a hat. What's a bowler? Bowler
[27:53.690 --> 27:55.570]  is a hat. What's a fedora? That's
[27:55.570 --> 27:57.470]  a hat. I think anything with like a brim.
[27:57.690 --> 27:59.550]  What's a beanie? A beanie is
[27:59.550 --> 28:01.330]  a beanie. You're a fool, Andrew.
[28:01.550 --> 28:03.450]  I listed four hats. You said
[28:03.450 --> 28:05.430]  three of them were hats and then said the other one wasn't.
[28:05.530 --> 28:07.570]  What are you on about? Because they all have
[28:07.570 --> 28:09.510]  brims. They all have brims where there's
[28:09.510 --> 28:11.490]  like a hard part. There's a structure. A beanie is
[28:11.490 --> 28:13.570]  just like a piece of fabric. It's not a hat.
[28:13.770 --> 28:15.550]  You don't need a brim to
[28:15.550 --> 28:17.810]  be a hat, though. I feel like you kind of do.
[28:18.030 --> 28:19.130]  What about a welder's hat?
[28:19.270 --> 28:21.450]  Well, that's not a hat. That's protective
[28:21.450 --> 28:23.310]  gear. What about a brimmed beanie?
[28:23.630 --> 28:25.470]  Says Eric. A brimmed beanie
[28:25.470 --> 28:27.470]  is just confused. What about
[28:27.470 --> 28:29.470]  a thing called a welder's hat?
[28:29.730 --> 28:31.590]  Oh, the welder's hat's not a hat. It's called a
[28:31.590 --> 28:33.170]  hat, but it's not a hat. It's a hat.
[28:33.250 --> 28:35.570]  What's a hard hat? Well, that's a
[28:35.570 --> 28:37.030]  hat. Why? Because it's
[28:37.510 --> 28:39.030]  not a beanie.
[28:40.610 --> 28:41.510]  Seems to me like
[28:41.510 --> 28:43.250]  a beanie is nothing more
[28:43.250 --> 28:45.250]  than a soft hat. What is a
[28:45.250 --> 28:47.170]  welder's hat? What do you even
[28:47.170 --> 28:49.330]  mean by... Like, I looked up welder's hat. I'm not
[28:49.330 --> 28:51.430]  seeing... I've heard of a welder's mask.
[28:51.750 --> 28:53.370]  Do you protect...
[28:53.370 --> 28:55.250]  I mean, it's mainly a mask. It's not really
[28:55.250 --> 28:57.110]  a hat. Did you mean mask?
[28:57.290 --> 28:59.290]  No, no, no. No, dumbass. No.
[28:59.450 --> 29:01.030]  Hold on. Oh, Nick asks,
[29:01.150 --> 29:03.250]  is a fez a hat? I don't know what a...
[29:03.250 --> 29:05.170]  Yes. What is a fez? What do you mean
[29:05.170 --> 29:07.390]  you don't know what a fez is? Is a fez...
[29:07.390 --> 29:09.150]  Oh, no. I know what a fez is. I know the guy from
[29:09.150 --> 29:11.290]  The Mummy had the... A fez
[29:11.290 --> 29:13.110]  is a fez. A fez is not a hat.
[29:13.410 --> 29:15.250]  I don't think you... I think a hat is
[29:15.250 --> 29:17.330]  clothing for your head. I think that's
[29:17.330 --> 29:19.430]  what a hat is. That's too broad.
[29:19.710 --> 29:20.990]  I think a hat is a hat
[29:20.990 --> 29:23.290]  and a fez is a fez. I think you know
[29:23.290 --> 29:25.390]  what a hat is. Well, you might
[29:25.390 --> 29:27.550]  be right, actually. I don't think a turban is a hat.
[29:27.610 --> 29:28.970]  No, it's definitely not a hat.
[29:29.210 --> 29:30.770]  Lincoln Electric, that's a welder's hat.
[29:32.810 --> 29:33.390]  Why wouldn't
[29:33.390 --> 29:34.850]  it be a part of the mask?
[29:35.230 --> 29:36.310]  I don't know. It's just a hat.
[29:36.890 --> 29:39.270]  It's what welders wear. Probably to... I don't know
[29:39.270 --> 29:41.270]  why I'm not a welder! I thought the welder thing
[29:41.270 --> 29:43.410]  covered your full head. Maybe it's
[29:43.410 --> 29:45.170]  to create separation
[29:45.170 --> 29:47.330]  between your head and the thing? Probably
[29:47.330 --> 29:49.350]  to soak up heat, too, because it's hot
[29:49.350 --> 29:51.150]  as dicks in there. I just don't think
[29:51.150 --> 29:53.370]  a beanie is a hat, and I certainly don't think
[29:53.370 --> 29:55.390]  that a cup is a bag. We could Google it.
[29:55.430 --> 29:57.170]  Is a beanie...
[29:57.170 --> 29:59.270]  Look up fruit bag and tell me if you find
[29:59.270 --> 30:01.110]  a single cup. You're not going to.
[30:01.370 --> 30:03.430]  You're gonna find mesh, is what you're gonna find.
[30:03.570 --> 30:05.270]  A fruit bag? Yeah. Well, that's
[30:05.270 --> 30:07.330]  how this all started. You said they sell bags of
[30:07.330 --> 30:08.950]  fruit, and I was very confused by that.
[30:09.290 --> 30:10.990]  Oh, here's another one. Hold on. Look at this.
[30:11.190 --> 30:11.730]  Wait a second.
[30:12.890 --> 30:14.850]  Wait a second. What have you got?
[30:15.090 --> 30:17.170]  McDonald's actually sells fruit bags,
[30:17.510 --> 30:18.710]  but it is not a container.
[30:18.930 --> 30:20.870]  Wait. Post a picture of the fruit bag?
[30:21.050 --> 30:23.330]  Okay. I'm gonna be Geoff. It's gonna take me 20 minutes
[30:23.330 --> 30:25.230]  to save this photo and get it there, but it's
[30:25.230 --> 30:27.290]  coming. Fruit bags exist, but
[30:27.290 --> 30:29.190]  they're not containers. What if you search
[30:29.190 --> 30:30.450]  for Richard Lewis hot?
[30:31.670 --> 30:33.530]  I don't... I mean...
[30:33.530 --> 30:35.190]  Somebody has to be into Richard Lewis.
[30:35.190 --> 30:37.310]  Well, I'm into Richard Lewis. I think the guy's hilarious.
[30:37.430 --> 30:39.190]  I think he's very talented. No, I... yeah, I think
[30:39.190 --> 30:41.150]  he's funny, too, but I'm saying you're talking purely
[30:41.150 --> 30:43.190]  visual. That's a... that's
[30:43.190 --> 30:45.190]  a rough one, Eric. That's a
[30:45.190 --> 30:47.590]  rough Richard Lewis photo. He looks...
[30:47.590 --> 30:49.190]  I sent that. I... what do you mean
[30:49.190 --> 30:50.830]  you said that? Sorry, I was looking at fruit bags.
[30:51.190 --> 30:53.110]  Did I miss a Richard Lewis? I... no,
[30:53.150 --> 30:54.650]  I just sent that... that Richard Lewis photo.
[30:54.810 --> 30:57.150]  Oh, it's... I didn't see... it's just
[30:57.150 --> 30:59.150]  Eric's photo, so I assumed he did. Gavin, do
[30:59.150 --> 31:01.090]  you see what happens when you're late? This is the
[31:01.090 --> 31:03.110]  episode. This is the whole episode. This
[31:03.110 --> 31:05.290]  is a mess. What did you do? This is no good.
[31:05.830 --> 31:06.890]  Um, I feel like
[31:06.890 --> 31:09.110]  I don't know what's been talked about. I'm really
[31:09.110 --> 31:11.210]  intrigued by the egg thing, but I don't want to talk about
[31:11.210 --> 31:13.170]  it because I assume it's been talked about. You
[31:13.170 --> 31:15.190]  should listen to F*** Face. Uh, it'll...
[31:15.190 --> 31:17.170]  we'll cover it really quickly at the beginning.
[31:17.210 --> 31:19.190]  Here we go. Fruit bag. Bam. Uh, I've
[31:19.190 --> 31:21.190]  got a question here. Is a beanie considered
[31:21.190 --> 31:23.190]  a hat? Why or why not? The answer is
[31:23.190 --> 31:25.090]  what is motivating this question?
[31:27.310 --> 31:27.690]  That's
[31:27.690 --> 31:29.450]  a bag of fruit, Andrew. What you tell...
[31:29.450 --> 31:31.150]  That's... Yeah, no, it absolutely
[31:31.150 --> 31:33.270]  is. I agree. Oh, it's like a
[31:33.270 --> 31:35.170]  fruit container. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's not a
[31:35.170 --> 31:37.350]  fruit container. That is a fruit... It's containing
[31:38.410 --> 31:39.050]  multiple pieces
[31:39.050 --> 31:41.030]  of fruit, and it's containing them
[31:41.030 --> 31:43.290]  all together. I've never seen a fruit bag.
[31:43.410 --> 31:45.130]  I said, do you mean they literally have
[31:45.130 --> 31:47.290]  them in a bag? And you said, no, they're in a container.
[31:47.490 --> 31:49.250]  And that's how this all started. I accept
[31:49.250 --> 31:50.950]  that there are fruit bags, but I've never seen one.
[31:51.030 --> 31:53.190]  I literally described it as a fruit bag.
[31:53.250 --> 31:55.170]  I said, bag of fruit, Andrew. But I said,
[31:55.170 --> 31:56.910]  did you mean container? And you said, yes.
[31:56.930 --> 31:59.010]  Which is what caused this whole thing of a container
[31:59.010 --> 32:01.050]  is definitely not a bag. I think we can all
[32:01.050 --> 32:03.030]  agree on that. I don't know. I don't know if you're right.
[32:03.150 --> 32:05.130]  A bag can contain fruit...
[32:05.130 --> 32:07.050]  Well... Objective one for a
[32:07.050 --> 32:08.930]  container, it contains the item.
[32:09.150 --> 32:10.710]  And that's what this bag is doing here.
[32:10.910 --> 32:13.090]  I feel like if you ask a hundred people
[32:13.090 --> 32:15.050]  is this a container, nobody says yes.
[32:15.230 --> 32:17.070]  Out of a hu... You think a hundred for
[32:17.070 --> 32:19.230]  a hundred. I think a hundred for a hundred.
[32:19.350 --> 32:21.470]  I don't think anyone... That's ludicrous.
[32:21.650 --> 32:23.090]  You've got a Discord, right? Put up
[32:23.090 --> 32:25.090]  a poll or something. How about this? If we need
[32:25.090 --> 32:26.930]  to do that, and if you lose, you gotta go
[32:26.930 --> 32:29.010]  full pickle. I wanna see you go to a gas
[32:29.010 --> 32:30.790]  station. I wanna see you buy...
[32:30.790 --> 32:33.110]  I wanna see you buy a pickle in a pickle bag.
[32:33.190 --> 32:35.090]  A big-ass honkin' giant
[32:35.090 --> 32:36.950]  dill pickle, the size of like
[32:36.950 --> 32:38.890]  a porn star's cock. And I wanna see
[32:38.890 --> 32:40.810]  you rip that bag with all that pickle juice
[32:40.810 --> 32:42.770]  and eat that whole fuckin' deep-throated
[32:42.770 --> 32:44.950]  and eat that pickle. Have you never had a pickle?
[32:45.310 --> 32:46.970]  Gavin, what you missed earlier is that Andrew's
[32:46.970 --> 32:48.790]  also never had a pickle. That's fair. Not
[32:48.790 --> 32:50.870]  intentionally. I feel like
[32:50.870 --> 32:53.030]  maybe, Eric, we should do a live
[32:53.030 --> 32:54.950]  recording Twitter poll, like we sometimes
[32:54.950 --> 32:56.870]  do, and see if anyone thinks a
[32:56.870 --> 32:58.550]  bag is a container. No.
[32:58.910 --> 33:00.910]  No, don't do it that way. Don't word it in
[33:00.910 --> 33:02.910]  container or bag. How would you like it worded?
[33:03.010 --> 33:04.970]  I'm trying to fuckin' explain it, Gavin.
[33:05.170 --> 33:06.830]  And you cut me off in my
[33:06.830 --> 33:08.890]  explanation. Just post
[33:08.890 --> 33:11.190]  the photo and say, what is this?
[33:11.670 --> 33:13.090]  And we'll see what they say.
[33:13.210 --> 33:14.890]  You want it to just say
[33:14.890 --> 33:16.770]  what is this?
[33:16.890 --> 33:18.750]  Yes, I do. Because if you say container
[33:18.750 --> 33:20.910]  or bag, some people will be like,
[33:20.970 --> 33:23.010]  oh, everyone's going bag. I'm gonna be wacky
[33:23.010 --> 33:24.950]  container guy. I don't wanna... That's not
[33:24.950 --> 33:26.330]  gonna tell us anything.
[33:26.690 --> 33:28.910]  No, it will. You just want
[33:28.910 --> 33:30.850]  the question to be, what
[33:30.850 --> 33:33.030]  is this? Yes, I do.
[33:33.370 --> 33:34.910]  Because if you give them A or B,
[33:35.150 --> 33:36.850]  some will just pick container because
[33:36.850 --> 33:39.010]  they wanna be goofy and original. Okay, what if
[33:39.010 --> 33:40.850]  you just say, what is a bag? No.
[33:41.250 --> 33:42.910]  That's really confusing. Like,
[33:42.970 --> 33:44.770]  are we going deep? Like, what is the spiritual
[33:44.770 --> 33:46.850]  meaning? What is... There's nothing spiritual
[33:46.850 --> 33:49.070]  about a bag. I mean, if you wanna get
[33:49.070 --> 33:51.130]  serious about any topic, you can go deep.
[33:51.130 --> 33:53.130]  Like, what is a bag? What does it mean?
[33:53.250 --> 33:55.350]  What is the metaphor of a bag? Uh...
[33:55.350 --> 33:57.230]  I'm not expecting you to have an answer. I'm just saying
[33:57.230 --> 33:59.130]  someone would go that way. So, I think you
[33:59.130 --> 34:01.010]  just take the photo. I'm even
[34:01.010 --> 34:03.330]  fine if we remove the bag part
[34:03.330 --> 34:05.010]  of the package and ask,
[34:05.190 --> 34:07.170]  what is this? Wait, hang
[34:07.170 --> 34:08.310]  on. So, you want
[34:08.310 --> 34:10.530]  me to post a picture
[34:11.030 --> 34:12.710]  but remove the bag,
[34:12.970 --> 34:15.230]  which is what we are arguing about
[34:15.230 --> 34:17.210]  if it's a container or not. And you just
[34:17.210 --> 34:19.170]  want that posted and have it
[34:19.170 --> 34:20.830]  say, what is this?
[34:20.930 --> 34:22.270]  People would just say apples.
[34:23.550 --> 34:24.670]  That is a problem.
[34:24.990 --> 34:26.770]  You're right. I'm not gonna argue that.
[34:27.190 --> 34:29.110]  But the issue is, nobody's
[34:29.110 --> 34:31.330]  gonna say container. Well, they also, it's gonna...
[34:31.330 --> 34:32.930]  They're gonna say bag
[34:32.930 --> 34:35.130]  because it says bag on the fucking... That's my point.
[34:35.230 --> 34:37.130]  That's why I said you can cover that if you want.
[34:37.390 --> 34:39.070]  I'm fine with that. But nobody
[34:39.070 --> 34:40.870]  would say container unless you
[34:40.870 --> 34:42.950]  assist them with the word container. What if
[34:42.950 --> 34:44.850]  you post a picture of a bunch of apple slices
[34:44.850 --> 34:47.110]  and you say, how can these
[34:47.110 --> 34:47.890]  be contained?
[34:48.170 --> 34:48.410]  What?
[34:50.830 --> 34:53.130]  That's no good. That's way more
[34:53.130 --> 34:54.990]  complicated. I'll do this right now.
[34:55.070 --> 34:57.250]  I'll post on Twitter. I'll upload
[34:57.250 --> 34:59.230]  a photo of this item.
[34:59.650 --> 35:01.070]  I won't even try to sway people.
[35:01.330 --> 35:03.390]  You are gonna word this in such
[35:03.390 --> 35:05.370]  a lopsided, biased way.
[35:05.450 --> 35:06.710]  It's gonna be infuriating.
[35:06.870 --> 35:09.010]  How is just saying, what is this
[35:09.010 --> 35:11.290]  infuriating or lopsided? Because no one's
[35:11.290 --> 35:13.070]  gonna write container.
[35:13.670 --> 35:15.230]  Exactly! Right, but that's
[35:15.230 --> 35:17.070]  not what you're asking them. If you asked,
[35:17.230 --> 35:19.230]  is a bag a container, we would have
[35:19.230 --> 35:20.850]  some actual information to go off.
[35:21.070 --> 35:22.870]  Some people would say no, some people would say yes.
[35:23.130 --> 35:25.390]  But I'm saying, if a hundred people reply,
[35:25.710 --> 35:27.230]  there will be several people who say yes.
[35:27.490 --> 35:29.150]  But I don't think anyone
[35:29.150 --> 35:31.230]  actually feels that way. I think people, if you
[35:31.230 --> 35:33.290]  give them the option of container, will pick it
[35:33.290 --> 35:34.890]  because they see everyone else going bag.
[35:34.990 --> 35:37.210]  I don't think those will be real answers. I think if you just
[35:37.210 --> 35:39.190]  post the photo... So you don't trust the audience?
[35:39.570 --> 35:40.630]  No, I don't trust people. No!
[35:41.270 --> 35:41.990]  Absolutely not!
[35:42.810 --> 35:44.370]  I've witnessed two different cults,
[35:44.450 --> 35:45.650]  Geoff. I have zero trust
[35:45.650 --> 35:47.770]  for this bit. Says a lot about you.
[35:47.970 --> 35:49.990]  You're probably at your worst point with the audience though
[35:49.990 --> 35:51.950]  because you're deep, like in terms of what's come out,
[35:52.050 --> 35:54.050]  you're deep in like, ruining the court
[35:54.050 --> 35:56.010]  case right now. Tomorrow's the court
[35:56.010 --> 35:57.970]  case, right? We like, they're recording this on a
[35:57.970 --> 36:00.010]  Tuesday. So tomorrow that comes out,
[36:00.090 --> 36:01.430]  woo! Woo boy!
[36:01.870 --> 36:03.490]  Are you worried? No, I'm not worried.
[36:03.650 --> 36:05.950]  I think people generally understand
[36:05.950 --> 36:06.770]  it's a joke.
[36:08.290 --> 36:10.130]  I think there's a percentage that
[36:10.130 --> 36:11.710]  definitely don't, but
[36:11.710 --> 36:14.470]  I think the ones that do will enjoy it.
[36:14.610 --> 36:15.350]  Oh man!
[36:16.610 --> 36:18.330]  I'm certainly gonna enjoy it.
[36:18.530 --> 36:20.250]  Wouldn't it be apropos, like,
[36:20.450 --> 36:22.110]  and I'm not saying we should do this,
[36:22.170 --> 36:24.070]  but maybe we should do this, where
[36:24.070 --> 36:26.130]  since Eric and I showed up 30 minutes
[36:26.130 --> 36:28.190]  early, we should get to leave 10 minutes
[36:28.190 --> 36:30.210]  early, and then Andrew should have to leave 10 minutes
[36:30.210 --> 36:32.050]  after that, and then Gavin has to do the last
[36:32.050 --> 36:34.190]  10 minutes by himself since he showed up late. So it's like
[36:34.190 --> 36:35.610]  a split timeline episode?
[36:36.010 --> 36:38.230]  Otherwise we're all working way harder than you. I'm okay
[36:38.230 --> 36:40.170]  with this. I mean, I wasn't trying to work
[36:40.170 --> 36:42.390]  less hard. You just made that happen
[36:42.390 --> 36:42.850]  yourself.
[36:44.050 --> 36:46.290]  By caring so much about our job
[36:46.290 --> 36:48.290]  we got here early. Early isn't
[36:48.290 --> 36:49.970]  good! I'm telling you, it's not good.
[36:50.130 --> 36:52.370]  Early is good, but Geoff said it
[36:52.370 --> 36:53.790]  in a way that was, like, kind.
[36:53.990 --> 36:56.370]  This was like a joke bid against you. It wasn't
[36:56.370 --> 36:58.150]  from the kindness of our hearts to be this early
[36:58.150 --> 37:00.430]  that kind of flipped against us in our own way.
[37:00.630 --> 37:02.170]  But I'm okay with... I mean,
[37:02.170 --> 37:04.670]  I don't want it to be a nightmare for Nick. I'm happy to...
[37:04.670 --> 37:06.230]  Yeah, it wouldn't be fair to Nick. That's a
[37:06.230 --> 37:08.270]  good point. We had to stick around for Nick. Do it for Nick.
[37:08.410 --> 37:10.250]  That's what we say. Okay, the tweet is out.
[37:10.350 --> 37:12.370]  What's your issue with eggs? I just have never
[37:12.370 --> 37:14.130]  had them. So, uh, I've never
[37:14.130 --> 37:16.290]  had them. Once again, I'm sure I've had them
[37:16.290 --> 37:17.930]  accidentally in another dish.
[37:18.090 --> 37:20.170]  Thanks for that explanation. Yeah,
[37:20.210 --> 37:22.190]  I mean, what do you want from me? Um, we're deep
[37:22.190 --> 37:24.490]  in a bag container thing. Fruit bag.
[37:24.690 --> 37:26.190]  Not a pencil. I don't
[37:26.190 --> 37:28.250]  think this is gonna be a useful tool to
[37:28.250 --> 37:30.270]  get an answer for this. If I
[37:30.270 --> 37:32.050]  send you a bag of eggs, will you eat them?
[37:32.270 --> 37:34.190]  No. No, I wouldn't. I'll cook them for you.
[37:34.190 --> 37:36.190]  It's not I can't find eggs. I can
[37:36.190 --> 37:38.290]  easily go buy eggs. It's just I've never had
[37:38.290 --> 37:39.970]  them. There's so many different ways to prepare
[37:39.970 --> 37:42.030]  eggs, too, and they all taste different. I wonder
[37:42.030 --> 37:44.310]  if you... Yeah. Like, you might
[37:44.310 --> 37:46.450]  find... Ooh, what kind of eggs does Andrew
[37:46.450 --> 37:48.330]  like? Like, a fried egg and a scrambled
[37:48.330 --> 37:50.190]  egg is night and day. I feel like a
[37:50.190 --> 37:52.170]  scrambled egg would be real good. Or
[37:52.170 --> 37:54.190]  like a poached egg, for instance. Yeah.
[37:54.190 --> 37:56.390]  Like, a poached egg's a totally different world. Soft-boiled,
[37:56.490 --> 37:58.350]  hard-boiled. Deviled. Scotch.
[37:58.550 --> 37:59.850]  Sunny-side up.
[38:00.430 --> 38:02.330]  Over-easy. Over-medium.
[38:02.330 --> 38:03.930]  Over-hard. Runny.
[38:04.130 --> 38:06.370]  What kind of eggs? You could go for Balut.
[38:06.710 --> 38:08.270]  I think I'd go scrambled. Feels like a
[38:08.270 --> 38:10.310]  safe, comfort-type egg food.
[38:10.730 --> 38:12.430]  I think I'd start with scrambled. Egg sandwich?
[38:13.030 --> 38:14.090]  Where did the
[38:14.090 --> 38:16.270]  corn thing end up? Corn? Oh!
[38:16.610 --> 38:18.170]  I think they eat, like, 12 cobs.
[38:18.290 --> 38:20.630]  I guess we should describe that to somebody. A moderator
[38:20.630 --> 38:22.230]  on the F*** Face Discord
[38:22.230 --> 38:24.190]  was convinced they could eat 50
[38:24.190 --> 38:26.030]  corns a cob... corn on the cobs
[38:26.030 --> 38:28.510]  in 24 hours. Is it corn on the cobs
[38:28.510 --> 38:30.490]  or corns on the cob? It's corn
[38:30.490 --> 38:32.250]  on the cobs. It's corn on the cobs.
[38:33.310 --> 38:34.450]  It is so tricky.
[38:34.770 --> 38:36.510]  It'll stumble you, like it just did me.
[38:36.710 --> 38:38.470]  But yeah, they couldn't do it. They tried hard,
[38:38.810 --> 38:40.530]  but it's just too much corn. I feel like
[38:40.530 --> 38:42.530]  that'd be easier than burgers, though. No, you're
[38:42.530 --> 38:44.490]  absurd. A burger has this, a lot of
[38:44.490 --> 38:46.550]  density in a burger.
[38:46.970 --> 38:48.210]  A corn is like,
[38:48.490 --> 38:50.450]  the inside is empty. Is that what you meant
[38:50.450 --> 38:52.510]  by it flattens easier? When we were talking
[38:52.510 --> 38:54.470]  about this, you said it flattens better,
[38:54.630 --> 38:56.510]  and I already called you absurd
[38:56.510 --> 38:58.250]  and I didn't even know what that meant, so I
[38:58.250 --> 39:00.210]  didn't want to repeat it. Yeah, I said
[39:00.210 --> 39:02.330]  corn flattens easier and corn
[39:02.330 --> 39:04.470]  is smaller than burger. I mean, once again,
[39:04.530 --> 39:06.110]  you're right, but that makes no difference.
[39:06.210 --> 39:08.330]  They're different foods. Corn has a
[39:08.330 --> 39:10.090]  lot of liquid in it. That adds up.
[39:10.250 --> 39:12.090]  You got more sugar in corn, I assume.
[39:12.330 --> 39:14.210]  Well, maybe not. Doesn't digest great,
[39:14.270 --> 39:15.970]  either. No, it's real bad.
[39:16.270 --> 39:18.390]  Well, that was the, that's where it devolved
[39:18.390 --> 39:20.530]  into, right? Was like, could you create
[39:20.530 --> 39:22.030]  a corn on the cob with a turd?
[39:22.230 --> 39:24.290]  If all you ate was corn, there wouldn't
[39:24.290 --> 39:26.410]  be anything to sort of stick them together
[39:26.410 --> 39:28.270]  in logs. I was worried they'd come out like
[39:28.270 --> 39:29.750]  birdshot and just blast
[39:30.330 --> 39:32.510]  like a sawn-off. Yeah. It didn't go
[39:32.510 --> 39:34.490]  well. I wouldn't recommend it. I, like, that's
[39:34.490 --> 39:36.430]  one I don't think I could ever see. Did you
[39:36.430 --> 39:38.470]  get any detailed information on what the
[39:38.470 --> 39:40.110]  bathroom was like the next day? No.
[39:40.350 --> 39:42.510]  Can you go back and ask? Because I think that would be
[39:42.510 --> 39:44.110]  probably the most useful information.
[39:44.410 --> 39:46.530]  If they, you said they did 13 corns on the cob,
[39:46.630 --> 39:48.290]  corn on the cobs? 13, 14,
[39:48.510 --> 39:50.350]  I'd say. In 12 hours? In
[39:50.350 --> 39:52.170]  24. That's, oh my god!
[39:52.310 --> 39:54.450]  That's not even trying! No. That's a cob
[39:54.450 --> 39:56.450]  every two hours. No, listen.
[39:56.490 --> 39:58.030]  Are they eating the cob, too?
[39:58.350 --> 40:00.410]  No, but they did hit a problem where
[40:00.410 --> 40:02.210]  their gums started to bleed because
[40:02.210 --> 40:04.610]  cobs. So just, so just
[40:04.610 --> 40:06.510]  You gotta scrape it off into a bowl
[40:06.510 --> 40:08.290]  or something. Don't be biting them off the cob.
[40:08.430 --> 40:10.290]  Yeah, scrape it off. Yeah, well, they
[40:10.290 --> 40:12.590]  went to the scrape-off by the time
[40:12.590 --> 40:14.110]  their gums were bleeding. Oh.
[40:14.910 --> 40:16.210]  It was, yeah, it's rough. Yeah,
[40:16.290 --> 40:18.550]  you don't wanna put your teeth through that. No, absolutely
[40:18.550 --> 40:20.370]  not. No. They tried very hard.
[40:20.630 --> 40:22.450]  It's just, once your gums start bleeding,
[40:22.450 --> 40:24.310]  it's an understandable point to stop.
[40:24.510 --> 40:26.450]  When trying to eat that much corn, you should
[40:26.450 --> 40:28.450]  definitely consult a dentist first.
[40:28.730 --> 40:30.310]  I also heard from Eric,
[40:30.510 --> 40:32.430]  Andrew, that you may have had some sort of financial
[40:32.430 --> 40:34.410]  calamity. Oh, boy. Before,
[40:34.570 --> 40:36.330]  okay, we can talk about that,
[40:36.630 --> 40:38.550]  but I wanna pivot
[40:38.550 --> 40:40.490]  for a second, because we were talking about
[40:40.490 --> 40:42.430]  the court case that happened last week.
[40:42.710 --> 40:44.610]  Didn't, it didn't happen. No, it did happen.
[40:44.710 --> 40:46.510]  It did happen. You guys won the
[40:46.510 --> 40:48.390]  case, so I don't know why you're saying it didn't happen.
[40:48.490 --> 40:50.390]  You won. Oh, sorry, you're talking about the one where
[40:50.390 --> 40:52.430]  we got the judge and you actually, we all
[40:52.430 --> 40:54.370]  showed up together. He's talking about the verdict, not the case.
[40:54.390 --> 40:56.490]  Oh, okay. Well, the verdict is clearly part
[40:56.490 --> 40:58.450]  of the trial. You can't have a verdict with no
[40:58.450 --> 41:00.010]  trial for the verdict to exist.
[41:00.230 --> 41:02.470]  You had a trial without anyone else there at all,
[41:02.530 --> 41:04.110]  so what are you talking about? Why are you
[41:04.110 --> 41:06.130]  arguing about something you won?
[41:06.350 --> 41:07.910]  This is such a bizarre thing.
[41:08.070 --> 41:10.350]  You won the thing. Why is this
[41:10.350 --> 41:12.270]  a debate? Because we didn't have the trial last week.
[41:12.330 --> 41:14.390]  You definitely had, the trial definitely happened
[41:14.390 --> 41:16.190]  and you won the verdict. Okay. But,
[41:16.330 --> 41:18.350]  I wasn't so sure about them, so I did
[41:18.350 --> 41:20.870]  some research and I looked it up.
[41:20.950 --> 41:22.630]  I went on their website. Oh, boy.
[41:22.930 --> 41:24.410]  And, uh, you can, when
[41:24.410 --> 41:26.050]  you go on their site, it's just one page.
[41:26.210 --> 41:27.650]  It's really, it's a simple website.
[41:27.890 --> 41:29.830]  On the left, it says,
[41:29.990 --> 41:32.410]  do you need a judge? And on the right,
[41:32.490 --> 41:34.310]  it says, do you want to apply
[41:34.310 --> 41:35.950]  to be a judge? Either request
[41:36.510 --> 41:39.290]  a judge or even apply. Jesus Christ.
[41:39.310 --> 41:40.530]  You're not a judge now, are you?
[41:40.950 --> 41:41.970]  So I applied
[41:42.670 --> 41:44.510]  and I'm absolutely a judge.
[41:44.650 --> 41:46.090]  I gave myself an A. Come on!
[41:46.090 --> 41:48.430]  I gave myself an A in every category.
[41:48.570 --> 41:49.870]  Let me drop this down real quick.
[41:50.250 --> 41:52.010]  The honorable, what's more
[41:52.010 --> 41:53.890]  honorable than a judge? The honorable
[41:53.890 --> 41:55.990]  judge, Andrew Panton. I've been
[41:55.990 --> 41:58.550]  accepted onto HiredJudge.com.
[41:58.870 --> 41:59.610]  I'm a judge.
[41:59.990 --> 42:01.570]  You haven't got any qualifications.
[42:01.750 --> 42:03.770]  Thank you so much for signing up with us. We hope that this
[42:03.770 --> 42:06.050]  experience is awesome. What is
[42:06.050 --> 42:07.870]  this site? I'm sorry. Oh, God.
[42:07.870 --> 42:09.890]  No, I'm very qualified. As an
[42:09.890 --> 42:12.110]  honorable man, I think that's kind of the first
[42:12.110 --> 42:13.970]  basis you need to get into the door.
[42:13.970 --> 42:16.110]  This is just an email confirmation for signing
[42:16.110 --> 42:17.930]  up. This isn't, hey, you're a judge now.
[42:18.190 --> 42:19.990]  No, that's what you, like, there's a bunch
[42:19.990 --> 42:21.710]  of steps and I've gone through the steps. I am a
[42:21.710 --> 42:23.750]  judge on their site. I'm a functioning judge.
[42:23.790 --> 42:25.950]  You're not a judge. I am absolutely a judge.
[42:26.070 --> 42:27.970]  I'm on HiredJudge.com. I don't know how you
[42:27.970 --> 42:30.030]  could deny that. So what cases have
[42:30.030 --> 42:31.970]  you presided over? Oh, no, I'm
[42:31.970 --> 42:34.090]  still, you know, I'm still looking. I'm still
[42:34.090 --> 42:35.910]  looking for a good case to rule on
[42:35.910 --> 42:37.950]  but I'm in the field. I'm
[42:37.950 --> 42:39.790]  seeing what's out there. I'm in a position.
[42:40.010 --> 42:41.910]  We've got to be so careful with what
[42:41.910 --> 42:43.630]  we do around this guy. Yeah, we do.
[42:44.030 --> 42:45.730]  We'd never think anything through.
[42:45.950 --> 42:48.030]  Now he's a judge. This is a nightmare
[42:48.030 --> 42:49.710]  for us. I'm
[42:49.710 --> 42:51.810]  assuming any other rooster
[42:51.810 --> 42:53.790]  teeth dispute, I'll have a seat at the table.
[42:54.050 --> 42:55.990]  I'll be weighing in. So this is, I think,
[42:56.010 --> 42:57.750]  a good position to be in going forward.
[42:57.850 --> 43:00.050]  Once again, you don't have any legal
[43:00.050 --> 43:01.990]  training. I've
[43:01.990 --> 43:04.070]  seen a few episodes of Law & Order
[43:04.070 --> 43:05.810]  and although that's not a judge
[43:05.810 --> 43:07.470]  show, they certainly go to court.
[43:07.890 --> 43:09.990]  Is that a judge show? Maybe I haven't
[43:09.990 --> 43:11.990]  seen. Have I seen SVU? Law &
[43:11.990 --> 43:13.650]  Order has a
[43:13.650 --> 43:16.030]  police part and then a judge part. You see
[43:16.030 --> 43:18.090]  it's like chocolate and vanilla ice cream.
[43:18.130 --> 43:20.070]  You get both sides. So are you the Honorable
[43:20.070 --> 43:22.010]  Andrew Panton? I'm the Honorable Andrew
[43:22.010 --> 43:23.550]  Panton. As I always have been.
[43:24.390 --> 43:25.410]  Esquire. Exactly.
[43:25.690 --> 43:27.570]  You want to talk about me
[43:27.570 --> 43:30.130]  having a long weekend, a financially
[43:30.130 --> 43:31.590]  disastrous weekend? We can do that.
[43:31.770 --> 43:33.930]  I just wanted to make sure that I got the
[43:33.930 --> 43:35.550]  higher judge thing. Well, before we...
[43:36.010 --> 43:38.090]  Mr. No
[43:38.090 --> 43:39.950]  Fun Badour over here is telling us we're at 45 minutes.
[43:40.190 --> 43:41.170]  Well, I'm at like 25.
[43:41.890 --> 43:44.010]  Do you have anything you wanted to cover
[43:44.010 --> 43:46.230]  today, Gavin, since you've had less time?
[43:46.690 --> 43:48.110]  No, just know that I'll be
[43:48.110 --> 43:50.070]  extremely early for the next recording. Can't wait
[43:50.070 --> 43:52.050]  to see you there. We'll start with you. Yep. Andrew,
[43:52.150 --> 43:54.110]  so you have your poverty
[43:54.110 --> 43:56.070]  stricken weekend. I had something
[43:56.070 --> 43:58.090]  I wanted to talk about, but I can definitely wait
[43:58.090 --> 44:00.130]  till next week. I also had a note in my
[44:00.130 --> 44:02.070]  fucking phone, because I keep notes
[44:02.070 --> 44:03.810]  and I went to look at today for the notes.
[44:04.030 --> 44:05.130]  Do you have bog roll folders?
[44:06.270 --> 44:07.090]  We just
[44:07.090 --> 44:09.110]  talked about that last week, right? So here's what
[44:09.110 --> 44:10.910]  the note I fucking found.
[44:10.910 --> 44:13.170]  Ah, shit. How do I find it? Where did
[44:13.170 --> 44:15.310]  it go? Wait, you brought this up without having
[44:15.310 --> 44:17.190]  the note ready? No, I did have
[44:17.190 --> 44:19.390]  it ready, and then I hit a button, and...
[44:19.390 --> 44:20.950]  Andrew, every time you play audio,
[44:21.310 --> 44:23.010]  you play it twice, so
[44:23.010 --> 44:24.930]  let Geoff have his not-preparedness.
[44:25.170 --> 44:27.130]  I've played audio twice once.
[44:27.470 --> 44:29.030]  Twice once? It happened once.
[44:29.290 --> 44:31.130]  My note was... it took me a second to
[44:31.130 --> 44:33.070]  find my email. It says, uh...
[44:33.070 --> 44:35.270]  Talk about bike trip when.
[44:35.490 --> 44:36.930]  Okay. When what?
[44:37.150 --> 44:37.850]  I don't know!
[44:38.750 --> 44:41.090]  What am I supposed to get from that? Why would I write
[44:41.090 --> 44:43.090]  that? Talk about bike trip
[44:43.090 --> 44:44.870]  when? Something obviously
[44:44.870 --> 44:47.230]  happened to me on a bike trip. Here's the problem.
[44:47.450 --> 44:48.970]  I ride my bike every goddamn
[44:48.970 --> 44:50.950]  day. And I wrote the note on
[44:50.950 --> 44:52.990]  September 15th. So how the fuck am I supposed
[44:52.990 --> 44:55.010]  to know what that meant? I feel like everything
[44:55.010 --> 44:57.070]  after when would have been the
[44:57.070 --> 44:58.890]  important part. That would have been the bits of right.
[44:58.950 --> 45:01.070]  I know! And I sent myself that
[45:01.070 --> 45:02.910]  email. And I kept it bold
[45:02.910 --> 45:05.130]  because I wanted to remember it. And it
[45:05.130 --> 45:06.990]  must have meant something to me eight
[45:06.990 --> 45:09.030]  days ago. I just...
[45:09.030 --> 45:11.010]  You sent me a fart.
[45:11.310 --> 45:12.990]  Fucking hate myself. Did you
[45:12.990 --> 45:15.190]  fart on a bike? Oh my god, I had
[45:15.190 --> 45:17.150]  a good fart. Should we play that one? Yeah, play it.
[45:17.170 --> 45:19.090]  Do you have it? Do you have
[45:19.090 --> 45:21.310]  it? Why would he have it? I've been prolific
[45:21.310 --> 45:22.950]  with the farting. He sent me this on
[45:22.950 --> 45:25.090]  Friday. Uh, the caption
[45:25.090 --> 45:27.030]  just said, it smells so
[45:27.030 --> 45:29.050]  bad. Taco Bell drive
[45:29.050 --> 45:29.330]  through.
[45:32.810 --> 45:34.930]  I did it while Emily was ordering
[45:34.930 --> 45:36.310]  so the Taco Bell dude heard it.
[45:37.810 --> 45:39.170]  I got Millie on her birthday
[45:39.170 --> 45:40.510]  the other day. That was a really good one too.
[45:41.170 --> 45:43.090]  The idea of labeling these has
[45:43.090 --> 45:45.210]  just changed my life. Oh, here's
[45:45.210 --> 45:46.910]  one. Here's one called Fart Beat.
[45:47.130 --> 45:49.030]  Isn't her birthday tomorrow? Yeah, but I
[45:49.030 --> 45:50.970]  don't have her this weekend. So we celebrated over
[45:50.970 --> 45:51.910]  the weekend. Check this out.
[45:53.770 --> 45:55.030]  It sounded like a heartbeat.
[45:55.330 --> 45:56.870]  If you loop that, that's my
[45:56.870 --> 45:57.270]  heartbeat.
[45:58.950 --> 46:00.910]  We should loop that. We should put
[46:00.910 --> 46:02.890]  up an EKG monitor
[46:03.870 --> 46:04.730]  with... And then
[46:04.730 --> 46:07.070]  let me find the one that Millie
[46:07.070 --> 46:08.910]  uh, oh my god. She said
[46:08.910 --> 46:10.610]  it was a question fart. Oh, here we go.
[46:10.930 --> 46:11.710]  Millie's birthday!
[46:14.870 --> 46:16.390]  I did it while she was trying to eat cake.
[46:17.830 --> 46:18.770]  Anyway, those are my fart
[46:18.770 --> 46:20.350]  recordings. Andrew, tell us why you're poor.
[46:20.770 --> 46:22.650]  Well, no, I'm not poor. Secondly,
[46:23.070 --> 46:24.730]  is there no bike story? I don't know
[46:24.730 --> 46:26.770]  what it is! My point was, I made the
[46:26.770 --> 46:28.190]  fucking note, and then I thought,
[46:28.650 --> 46:30.830]  oh, this is funny because we just had that conversation
[46:30.830 --> 46:32.750]  last week about bog roll holders
[46:32.750 --> 46:34.790]  or whatever, and I have no
[46:34.790 --> 46:36.430]  fucking clue. I f***ed face to myself.
[46:36.650 --> 46:38.350]  Okay, so what does the actual note say?
[46:38.470 --> 46:40.890]  It said, talk about bike story
[46:40.890 --> 46:42.470]  when. I feel like we could predict
[46:42.470 --> 46:44.590]  maybe what it is. Talk about bike story when
[46:44.590 --> 46:45.770]  the weather was bad.
[46:46.310 --> 46:48.630]  The weather's been bad a lot. Could this be a part
[46:48.630 --> 46:50.830]  two to your ghost? Could it be a ghost story
[46:50.830 --> 46:52.890]  again? When the man passed
[46:52.890 --> 46:54.590]  me. Is it any of these? No.
[46:54.590 --> 46:56.530]  When my butt was itchy.
[46:56.770 --> 46:58.530]  No, I already told the bike story when I
[46:58.530 --> 47:00.350]  fell over, so it wouldn't have been that.
[47:00.470 --> 47:02.510]  I have another point of you writing
[47:02.510 --> 47:04.630]  which I find, I always think this is really interesting
[47:04.630 --> 47:06.490]  to see how our brains work differently
[47:06.490 --> 47:08.630]  for labeling. Okay. So we upload our audio
[47:08.630 --> 47:10.690]  into a drive folder, and none
[47:10.690 --> 47:12.650]  of us do it the same way
[47:12.650 --> 47:14.710]  exactly. There's always a slight difference.
[47:14.850 --> 47:16.590]  Like, I label mine, Drew
[47:17.270 --> 47:18.650]  FF18. Gavin
[47:18.650 --> 47:20.550]  writes his FF18
[47:20.550 --> 47:22.790]  Gav. Eric writes f***face
[47:22.790 --> 47:25.010]  18 Eric. Geoff, no spaces
[47:25.010 --> 47:26.710]  at all. And I'm also
[47:26.710 --> 47:28.630]  just curious about the naming of this one.
[47:28.850 --> 47:30.830]  F***face 16, you're two episodes
[47:30.830 --> 47:32.430]  off. You're two episodes in the past.
[47:32.650 --> 47:34.770]  Then you write Geoff, and
[47:34.770 --> 47:36.870]  then it's haha. F***face
[47:36.870 --> 47:38.430]  16 Geoff, haha.
[47:38.910 --> 47:40.790]  Were you trying to write a message to
[47:40.790 --> 47:42.750]  somebody else? React to something? I don't
[47:42.750 --> 47:44.810]  know, dude. I just write. I write whatever I'm
[47:44.810 --> 47:46.850]  feeling in the moment. I know. Also
[47:46.850 --> 47:48.570]  by the way, I just realized we never started.
[47:48.870 --> 47:50.830]  Welcome to F***face podcast episode
[47:50.830 --> 47:52.630]  16. You didn't even do an intro?
[47:52.910 --> 47:54.750]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me is
[47:54.750 --> 47:56.590]  Gavin Free and Andrew Pantin.
[47:56.730 --> 47:59.030]  What the damn? You're joining us about
[47:59.030 --> 48:00.850]  90% of the way through it, but this
[48:00.850 --> 48:02.770]  is the 16th episode of our podcast. How
[48:02.770 --> 48:04.950]  are they joining us now? What's gonna make
[48:04.950 --> 48:06.870]  them be like, oh, I can sense that the intro
[48:06.870 --> 48:08.250]  is 50 minutes in.
[48:08.970 --> 48:10.550]  We really don't need an intro.
[48:10.750 --> 48:12.590]  Well, we didn't get one this week. I totally
[48:12.590 --> 48:14.690]  we f***faced our intro by bunny
[48:14.690 --> 48:17.110]  hopping who could get here the earliest. What episode
[48:17.110 --> 48:18.510]  did you say that this was?
[48:18.510 --> 48:20.450]  16. Every episode of F***face is
[48:20.450 --> 48:22.490]  16 to me. I've decided. You're making
[48:22.490 --> 48:24.390]  this more complicated for all of us.
[48:24.470 --> 48:26.550]  I got news for you. This F***face file
[48:26.550 --> 48:28.450]  is, I named it 17 and then I said,
[48:28.490 --> 48:30.450]  oh wait, no, this is 16 and I renamed it 16.
[48:30.810 --> 48:32.410]  Can you restart at 20? This has
[48:32.410 --> 48:34.530]  gone, I mean, I was saying last week that
[48:34.530 --> 48:36.470]  can you imagine if that was the first episode?
[48:36.810 --> 48:38.090]  Like, it's gone so off the rails.
[48:38.430 --> 48:40.310]  What is this damn podcast gonna be like
[48:40.310 --> 48:42.590]  at episode 80? Like, what is that gonna sound
[48:42.590 --> 48:44.510]  like? Will it even be an audible product?
[48:44.690 --> 48:46.450]  Well, first off, it'll sound like me saying welcome to
[48:46.450 --> 48:48.790]  F***face 16. I'll be an actual
[48:48.790 --> 48:49.270]  judge.
[48:51.210 --> 48:52.370]  Andrew will have been
[48:52.370 --> 48:53.790]  disbarred and
[48:55.330 --> 48:56.510]  and then found a way
[48:56.510 --> 48:58.530]  to get himself rebarred. I'd like to be
[48:58.530 --> 49:00.490]  knighted, if I can get that done. That'd be a
[49:00.490 --> 49:02.410]  good goal by episode 80. I don't think
[49:02.410 --> 49:04.510]  I can. Can people from the Commonwealth
[49:04.510 --> 49:06.450]  not be knighted? I think
[49:06.450 --> 49:08.430]  you have to be born in Europe,
[49:08.430 --> 49:10.390]  right? I mean, Europe is a big
[49:11.050 --> 49:12.450]  place. I know,
[49:12.530 --> 49:14.430]  I think the restrictions are tighter. I just
[49:14.430 --> 49:16.350]  don't wanna, like, I don't know what they are,
[49:16.430 --> 49:18.590]  but I certainly don't think you can be born in, like, Canada
[49:18.590 --> 49:20.210]  or America. I think you get
[49:22.070 --> 49:22.710]  honorary knighthoods.
[49:23.470 --> 49:24.410]  Doesn't count. There's gotta
[49:24.410 --> 49:26.410]  be something under knighthood that's
[49:26.410 --> 49:28.310]  close you could get, though. Like OBE?
[49:28.630 --> 49:30.750]  If that's a thing. That just sounds like a...
[49:30.750 --> 49:32.550]  I don't like that. I think it's of the British
[49:32.550 --> 49:34.490]  Empire. So you get, like, letters
[49:34.490 --> 49:36.610]  after your name. Wait, let me look up OBE.
[49:36.970 --> 49:38.570]  It's probably not that. I once looked into
[49:38.570 --> 49:40.710]  like, I thought it would be funny to have as many titles
[49:40.710 --> 49:42.670]  before your name as possible. The most
[49:43.250 --> 49:44.650]  excellent order of the British
[49:44.650 --> 49:46.670]  Empire. Eh, it's kinda knighthood or bus
[49:46.670 --> 49:48.530]  for me. I just, I don't think it's possible.
[49:48.670 --> 49:50.630]  I was thinking the other day, if I were
[49:50.630 --> 49:52.530]  ever to become a doctor,
[49:52.850 --> 49:54.690]  like a PhD, which I'm not gonna
[49:54.690 --> 49:56.690]  do because I didn't go to college, or if I ever
[49:56.690 --> 49:58.650]  decided to go to med school and become a doctor, I would change
[49:58.650 --> 50:00.370]  my last name from Ramsey to Dentist.
[50:00.710 --> 50:02.890]  Just to fuck with people, because then I'd be Dr. Dentist
[50:02.890 --> 50:04.270]  and people wouldn't know what to think.
[50:04.430 --> 50:06.530]  I feel like you're creating more problems for you
[50:06.530 --> 50:08.330]  than anyone else. What? Andrew,
[50:08.530 --> 50:10.410]  what's the name of this podcast? What do you mean?
[50:10.410 --> 50:12.710]  Obviously I would fuckface myself with my name.
[50:12.930 --> 50:14.510]  Well yeah, but I'm saying like, I don't think
[50:14.510 --> 50:16.370]  that impacts anyone else as much
[50:16.370 --> 50:18.510]  as it would impact you. Oh, it would be a nightmare
[50:18.510 --> 50:20.270]  to me, because it would be funny exactly
[50:20.270 --> 50:22.350]  four times, and then I would be miserable for the next
[50:22.350 --> 50:24.070]  six or seven years. And,
[50:24.190 --> 50:26.530]  I've changed my name before, uh, you know,
[50:26.610 --> 50:28.550]  the first time, and uh,
[50:28.790 --> 50:30.630]  while I got a fucking awesome middle
[50:30.630 --> 50:32.370]  name out of it, and cool new last name,
[50:32.670 --> 50:34.490]  it totally fuckfaced me for about
[50:34.490 --> 50:36.250]  a decade on legal shit.
[50:36.470 --> 50:38.330]  I still have to have my fucking name change
[50:38.330 --> 50:40.310]  documentation with me, just in case
[50:40.310 --> 50:42.390]  every time I do anything important. Buy a house?
[50:42.650 --> 50:44.130]  Who's Geoff Fink? Ugh.
[50:44.510 --> 50:46.450]  Here we go again. I actually do get
[50:46.450 --> 50:48.370]  a sense of relief when I am filling out
[50:48.370 --> 50:50.290]  important paperwork, and it's like, any other
[50:50.290 --> 50:52.090]  aliases, and you're just like, nah.
[50:52.330 --> 50:54.430]  That's nice. I wouldn't want to have to fill that
[50:54.430 --> 50:56.350]  field in. Dr. Dentist is good.
[50:56.390 --> 50:58.070]  I think Dr. Judge would be good too.
[50:58.310 --> 51:00.410]  Ooh, Dr. Judge, that's
[51:00.410 --> 51:02.370]  interesting. Not as confusing, but just cool.
[51:02.570 --> 51:04.410]  I don't think Dr. Dentist is confusing,
[51:04.630 --> 51:06.330]  is my point. I fully encourage the
[51:06.330 --> 51:08.370]  idea, as you said, it's on brand for the
[51:08.370 --> 51:10.330]  show. Nobody has the last name Dentist.
[51:10.450 --> 51:12.530]  But I'm not phased by last names
[51:12.530 --> 51:14.330]  ever. What? I'm never like, well
[51:14.330 --> 51:16.390]  that's a crazy last name. Like, it never
[51:16.390 --> 51:18.390]  stuns me. I just don't know what you'd get
[51:18.390 --> 51:20.570]  out of it, is what I'm saying, outside of your own misery.
[51:20.790 --> 51:22.430]  The first time somebody said
[51:22.430 --> 51:24.370]  are you a dentist? And I said, no, that's my last
[51:24.370 --> 51:25.990]  name, idiot. That's what I would get out of it.
[51:26.450 --> 51:28.310]  Okay. I mean, hey, if you get
[51:28.310 --> 51:30.190]  something out of that, I encourage it.
[51:30.250 --> 51:32.130]  Yeah, that. So how are you gonna
[51:32.130 --> 51:34.230]  resolve this bag container
[51:34.230 --> 51:36.230]  thing? No one tweeted. Are we just gonna...
[51:36.230 --> 51:38.110]  No, I did. I guess I should check on it.
[51:38.150 --> 51:40.150]  You tweeted? Yeah, I tweeted it at the beginning
[51:40.150 --> 51:42.210]  of the show. Before I was there? No.
[51:42.490 --> 51:43.310]  After you were there.
[51:44.450 --> 51:45.990]  One tweet in the last hour.
[51:46.210 --> 51:48.390]  Let's see this. Fruit bag. What is this?
[51:48.410 --> 51:50.330]  And you just posted the fruit bag picture.
[51:50.510 --> 51:52.250]  Yeah, I did it as I thought it should
[51:52.250 --> 51:54.210]  be done. I'm not seeing any container
[51:54.210 --> 51:55.690]  and I think that's the important thing.
[51:55.830 --> 51:58.270]  Someone called Josh wrote, I see a picture
[51:58.270 --> 52:00.230]  of something that doesn't matter until you eat
[52:00.230 --> 52:02.250]  a pencil. Okay, people are still pissed at you.
[52:02.250 --> 52:03.810]  I don't think they're taking this seriously.
[52:04.050 --> 52:05.890]  Fruit bag? No, there's
[52:05.890 --> 52:07.850]  fresh and juicy fruit bag.
[52:08.110 --> 52:10.370]  Nobody is saying container. That's my point.
[52:10.410 --> 52:12.330]  That's because you didn't ask. I did ask.
[52:12.370 --> 52:14.350]  I said, what is this? What do you mean I didn't ask?
[52:14.430 --> 52:16.270]  That's like saying, like, no one wrote that you
[52:16.270 --> 52:18.210]  should eat it with your hands. But it's like, you didn't
[52:18.210 --> 52:20.070]  ask that. Yeah. I disagree.
[52:20.290 --> 52:21.710]  Not a great example Gavin's given you.
[52:21.810 --> 52:23.130]  He is right.
[52:23.810 --> 52:26.170]  I disagree. It's hard to support him. I think
[52:26.170 --> 52:28.150]  this is the most unbiased way to present
[52:28.150 --> 52:30.270]  the question. Geoff, help me out. Do a better analogy.
[52:30.730 --> 52:31.350]  It's a...
[52:32.030 --> 52:33.110]  What's a better analogy?
[52:34.090 --> 52:35.810]  It's hard. It's like posting
[52:36.490 --> 52:38.610]  a picture of
[52:38.610 --> 52:39.810]  Tom Martin.
[52:40.570 --> 52:41.910]  Okay, we should end this podcast.
[52:42.390 --> 52:43.910]  A picture of
[52:43.910 --> 52:46.190]  Bussy and saying, what is
[52:46.190 --> 52:48.090]  this? And if
[52:48.090 --> 52:49.910]  people just say it's a guy in a hockey
[52:49.910 --> 52:52.150]  uniform, that would be correct. But it's
[52:52.150 --> 52:54.130]  also Bussy. It's also a guy that was traded for
[52:54.130 --> 52:56.230]  a bus, but people might not know that, but it doesn't change the fact
[52:56.230 --> 52:57.890]  that it's not true. That was perfect, Geoff.
[52:57.890 --> 52:59.910]  It's not the first thing people thought of. I was just
[52:59.910 --> 53:01.850]  looking at her Instagram while I was saying
[53:01.850 --> 53:04.010]  that's all. I was just looking at what I
[53:04.010 --> 53:04.190]  saw.
[53:07.070 --> 53:07.710]  I disagree.
[53:08.030 --> 53:09.950]  This is hard. Well, why don't you make that your first
[53:09.950 --> 53:11.610]  case as the Honorable Andrew Panton?
[53:11.910 --> 53:13.570]  I rule in favor of me. Easy.
[53:13.710 --> 53:15.810]  No, you gotta be impartial. I am impartial.
[53:15.970 --> 53:17.910]  I could be Judge Gavel. That's a
[53:17.910 --> 53:19.350]  good name. You know what? How about this?
[53:19.730 --> 53:21.390]  It's like if you post a picture of a...
[53:22.270 --> 53:23.770]  I have a Diet Pepsi in my hand.
[53:24.110 --> 53:25.910]  I have a Diet Pepsi in my hand. So I'm looking at this
[53:25.910 --> 53:27.870]  Diet Pepsi and I'm thinking, if I post a picture of a Diet
[53:27.870 --> 53:29.850]  Pepsi and it just says, what is this?
[53:30.350 --> 53:32.010]  A hundred people might say
[53:32.010 --> 53:33.170]  it's a Diet Pepsi.
[53:34.430 --> 53:35.830]  Maybe nobody says
[53:35.830 --> 53:37.490]  it's an aluminum can,
[53:37.930 --> 53:39.750]  but it still is an aluminum can.
[53:40.030 --> 53:41.890]  That's right. My point was nobody
[53:41.890 --> 53:43.910]  is ever gonna say container. And I
[53:43.910 --> 53:45.950]  feel like this proves that. But a can is a
[53:45.950 --> 53:46.750]  container. What?
[53:48.390 --> 53:49.890]  It's a can-tainer. Yeah, I
[53:49.890 --> 53:51.850]  think, you know, I think you might be right. I think a
[53:51.850 --> 53:53.870]  can might be a container, but I don't...
[53:53.870 --> 53:56.230]  Nobody's gonna call it that. Is a can a bag?
[53:56.550 --> 53:57.730]  A can is definitely
[53:57.730 --> 53:59.890]  not a bag. Is it a hard bag?
[54:00.410 --> 54:02.050]  A bag is a soft
[54:02.610 --> 54:03.990]  container. You're right. A bag
[54:03.990 --> 54:04.790]  is a soft container.
[54:05.370 --> 54:07.630]  Well, I'm glad this was a short one for me.
[54:07.850 --> 54:09.810]  That was... it wasn't really. It was still
[54:09.810 --> 54:11.890]  40 minutes. Yeah, we keep going longer and
[54:11.890 --> 54:13.610]  longer. I mean, you keep...
[54:13.610 --> 54:15.810]  Derek yells at you for making the end
[54:15.810 --> 54:17.650]  too long, so this week you just made the beginning long.
[54:21.030 --> 54:21.750]  Oh, man.
[54:21.750 --> 54:23.650]  That's a good point. Andrew, uh, I
[54:23.650 --> 54:25.770]  still... fuck, we're so late. I guess we can't do
[54:25.770 --> 54:27.850]  it, but I... tell us why you're poor next week.
[54:27.910 --> 54:29.790]  I wanna know. No, yeah, we'll do it next
[54:29.790 --> 54:31.530]  week. And I wanna talk to you guys about a neighborhood
[54:31.530 --> 54:33.790]  and whether the neighborhood is a fuckface or
[54:33.790 --> 54:35.650]  not. When are we starting next week?
[54:35.730 --> 54:37.910]  Probably on time. It'd be really funny if we were late.
[54:39.410 --> 54:41.590]  I don't like all of the content that
[54:41.590 --> 54:43.710]  surrounds the content that isn't
[54:43.710 --> 54:46.070]  in the content. It's inconvenient,
[54:46.370 --> 54:47.650]  it's annoying, the
[54:48.250 --> 54:49.910]  audience doesn't... is not a part of it.
[54:49.910 --> 54:52.330]  I'm having a good time. I guess it is kind of in this one.
[54:52.570 --> 54:53.630]  So is that it then? Are we done?
[54:53.910 --> 54:56.410]  I think so. I think we're good. Hey, uh,
[54:56.450 --> 54:57.950]  special thanks to
[54:57.950 --> 54:59.890]  Andrew for showing up a little bit early today
[55:00.750 --> 55:01.970]  and for Eric for
[55:01.970 --> 55:03.950]  showing up even earlier. I appreciate your
[55:03.950 --> 55:05.450]  diligence and your dedication
[55:05.810 --> 55:07.970]  to the craft. Anytime, Geoff. You guys are the
[55:07.970 --> 55:09.850]  best. Some of you guys are the best. Thanks for listening to
[55:09.850 --> 55:11.570]  the podcast. You gotta say that you
[55:11.570 --> 55:13.450]  still haven't said any of the outro.
[55:14.170 --> 55:15.910]  Uh, why's it gotta be me? Why don't
[55:15.910 --> 55:18.010]  you say it? Because you're the host. Because you're
[55:18.010 --> 55:20.150]  the one who gets paid for making this. I don't get paid
[55:20.150 --> 55:21.970]  for making this any more than you guys do.
[55:22.250 --> 55:23.990]  Are we done with the show? I do it just to hang
[55:23.990 --> 55:26.010]  out with you guys. I don't make any money off this.
[55:26.070 --> 55:27.570]  Are we done? Did Eric leave?
[55:28.110 --> 55:29.410]  Uh, like and subscribe!
[55:30.150 --> 55:31.830]  Five stars! They left.
[55:32.070 --> 55:33.970]  They've got a separate ending one.
[55:34.230 --> 55:35.790]  Are you serious? What is going on?
[55:35.890 --> 55:37.630]  Should we go in there? End show chat.
[55:37.870 --> 55:40.250]  Is this from last week? Hello? Hey, what's up?
[55:40.370 --> 55:42.130]  Is it done now? Uh...
[55:42.130 --> 55:43.950]  Hey, we followed you guys over here. Okay. Yeah.
[55:43.970 --> 55:45.710]  Anyway, so, uh...
[55:45.710 --> 55:47.910]  Is this the end of the show?
[55:48.150 --> 55:49.710]  No, this is the end. Well, you gotta
[55:49.710 --> 55:51.670]  play us out. Thanks for listening. Rate
[55:51.670 --> 55:53.850]  five stars and subscribe. Tell everyone about F*** Face.
[55:53.970 --> 55:55.530]  Let us know. Follow us on Instagram
[55:55.530 --> 55:56.750]  at F*** Face Pod. Bye!
[55:57.910 --> 55:59.710]  I can't believe we had to chase that guy
[55:59.710 --> 56:01.270]  down just to get the end of the show. Jesus Christ.
[56:01.550 --> 56:02.650]  Andrew's not in here anymore.
[56:03.590 --> 56:05.930]  He's back out. Hey, you still over here?
[56:07.170 --> 56:07.530]  Okay.
[56:07.930 --> 56:09.830]  Alright, everyone, end
[56:09.830 --> 56:10.770]  your recordings. We're done.
