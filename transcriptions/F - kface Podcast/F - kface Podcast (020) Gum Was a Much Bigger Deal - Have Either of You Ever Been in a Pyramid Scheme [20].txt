[00:32.940 --> 00:37.440]  intro once again, but I'm here to promote a charitable raffle for an original fucked up
[00:37.440 --> 00:41.360]  fuckhat. This past Saturday was World Mental Health Day, which is something that is incredibly
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.580]  important to me, as I know it is for so many of you. To celebrate this, myself and Juliet,
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.460]  who's a moderator on our podcast Discord, have put together a raffle in which through a minimum
[00:51.460 --> 00:58.200]  of a $10 donation to the Center for Addictions and Mental Health, also known as CAMH, you'll be
[00:58.200 --> 01:03.480]  entered to become the first winner of a black fucked up fuckhat. Entering the raffle is incredibly
[01:03.480 --> 01:10.880]  easy. All you have to do is do the following steps. Step 1. Go to camh.ca and click the donate
[01:10.880 --> 01:15.820]  button in the top right. Every $10 you donate counts as one entry, so a $20 donation would be
[01:15.820 --> 01:22.160]  worth two. Step 2. After making your donation, screenshot proof of it. Step 3. Email the
[01:22.160 --> 01:28.860]  screenshot to fhatraffle at gmail.com. Alongside the screenshot, please include a social media
[01:28.860 --> 01:33.640]  handle that will be used to reach you if you win. Once again, the email has no spaces and
[01:33.640 --> 01:41.700]  is fhatraffle at gmail.com. That's fhatraffle at gmail.com. It also is important to state that if
[01:41.700 --> 01:47.320]  you do win, you must be able to provide some form of shipping address. Entries are open to this

[01:50.920 --> 01:55.820]  if you want. A winner will be drawn on October 18th, so every entry submitted today, which is
[01:55.820 --> 02:01.340]  Wednesday, October 14th, until this upcoming Sunday will be counted. CAMH is the largest

[02:19.320 --> 02:20.780]  attention. Enjoy the show.
[02:31.970 --> 02:35.270]  Gavin's here one minute early. That's a little inconvenient of him.
[02:35.450 --> 02:36.030]  Pretty inconvenient.
[02:36.170 --> 02:37.130]  Little inconsiderate.
[02:37.590 --> 02:38.990]  Who's Tate to the top?
[02:40.270 --> 02:40.930]  It was a whole thing.
[02:41.290 --> 02:41.990]  It was a whole thing.
[02:42.190 --> 02:43.470]  You missed it. You had to be there.
[02:43.610 --> 02:48.810]  It was very funny. That being said, Gavin, Andrew and I came up with an idea that's going to be a bit
[02:48.810 --> 02:52.850]  some point in the future of F*** Face, and I don't know that we'll tell you about it,
[02:52.950 --> 02:56.370]  but know that there's a very funny bit coming sometime in the next three years.
[02:56.530 --> 02:58.070]  Holy shit, I can't wait, Geoff.
[02:58.190 --> 03:02.530]  That's your reaction, I can't wait? With everything that's happened on this show? I'm excited?
[03:02.710 --> 03:04.290]  Oh, I should- oh. Oh, ooh.
[03:04.390 --> 03:08.830]  I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying, like, you and I have different reactions to
[03:08.830 --> 03:13.150]  unexpected bits or things that we know might be coming but aren't.
[03:13.270 --> 03:15.450]  I just feel like it can't be worse than anything else.
[03:15.770 --> 03:18.250]  What does that mean? What's your bar?
[03:19.110 --> 03:20.710]  What's the bar for anything else?
[03:20.910 --> 03:22.990]  Well, I don't know, look at the world.
[03:23.550 --> 03:27.150]  Okay, no, that's fair. In that context, you're right. It's not going to be that bad.
[03:27.370 --> 03:31.810]  Man, Gav, now that Boston has left the NBA playoffs and they cease to exist until the
[03:31.810 --> 03:35.450]  new season starts in January or whenever, I realize I can't talk to Andrew anymore.
[03:35.570 --> 03:36.350]  Because you disagree?
[03:36.530 --> 03:40.230]  No, we're going to have to go back to no communication. I texted him last night
[03:40.230 --> 03:44.250]  and I had something I wanted to say to him, and I couldn't remember what it was,
[03:44.250 --> 03:46.370]  and I texted him and I was like, hey, dude, you around?
[03:46.750 --> 03:51.010]  And then I checked back like 10 minutes later and I had forgotten what I was going to say.
[03:51.270 --> 03:53.350]  And I was like, ah, never mind. I can't remember what I was going to say.
[03:53.990 --> 03:57.630]  And then he was like, is this a bit? Are you doing a bit? And I was like, I don't think so.
[03:57.930 --> 04:00.810]  I can't remember what I was going to say. So I guess it could have been a bit, but I don't think
[04:00.810 --> 04:04.610]  I'm certainly not doing a bit now, but he wouldn't believe me. And then I was
[04:05.010 --> 04:07.310]  confused as to whether he was doing a bit. And now it's just like,
[04:07.310 --> 04:08.610]  I just got to wash my hands of the whole thing.
[04:09.350 --> 04:12.430]  Wait, are you saying that in order to start a text conversation with someone,
[04:12.430 --> 04:16.910]  you don't just type the thing, you say, hello, like, are you there first?
[04:17.290 --> 04:22.530]  No, no, he, no, you didn't do, he meant it was something specific to the show,
[04:22.690 --> 04:27.690]  which then made me suspicious later. It was, I don't remember what the exact wording was,
[04:27.730 --> 04:30.550]  but it was a question and regards to today.
[04:30.750 --> 04:32.710]  Well, all right, I'm just going to pull it up because it's...
[04:32.710 --> 04:35.790]  I think it was like, you ready for tomorrow or something? And I didn't,
[04:35.890 --> 04:37.310]  I was like, yeah, of course.
[04:37.450 --> 04:41.330]  Oh, yeah, yeah. I texted him. I said, hey, are you ready to record tomorrow? And he said,
[04:41.330 --> 04:44.590]  of course, it's my favorite part of the week. I love you. You're my favorite person on earth.
[04:44.770 --> 04:45.670]  Please don't tell Gavin.
[04:45.870 --> 04:46.610]  Some of that is true.
[04:48.030 --> 04:51.630]  While I'm not myself attracted to men, I do find you very attractive,
[04:51.710 --> 04:53.970]  which I thought was a strange thing for him to say, but I was like, cool, man, appreciate it.
[04:53.990 --> 04:57.510]  I think you're great too. And he said, no, no, I mean it. I really mean it. You're sexy.
[04:57.550 --> 05:01.090]  And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I said, anyway, sorry, I forgot what I asked you.
[05:01.610 --> 05:05.910]  I, and I was like, that's lame. I asked you, I was going to, I hit you up like 90 seconds
[05:05.910 --> 05:09.870]  ago to ask you a question. I can't believe I forgot already. And then he, then he lost his mind.
[05:09.870 --> 05:13.890]  I don't think I lost my mind. I just, I was, I brought up a level of concern.
[05:14.070 --> 05:18.230]  It's very odd to forget something 90 seconds later that is so specific.
[05:18.570 --> 05:23.070]  Like you had no clue or you appeared to at least have no clue, which makes no sense.
[05:23.350 --> 05:28.910]  I really don't. I really don't. It's a 45, dude. My brain years are behind me. Although I will say
[05:28.910 --> 05:32.250]  I'm pretty jazzed about my idea to make little baseball bats that say **** face on them.
[05:32.890 --> 05:34.070]  That's a bad idea.
[05:34.510 --> 05:35.710]  It's the best idea ever.
[05:35.970 --> 05:37.730]  Why? Why would we do that?
[05:37.730 --> 05:40.530]  The cute little baseball bats that you get at the game. And then on the bottom,
[05:40.650 --> 05:42.570]  they say **** face instead of with our logo.
[05:42.790 --> 05:45.070]  Do you realize that this isn't actually a baseball podcast?
[05:45.990 --> 05:51.510]  Yeah, but it's called **** face because of a Billy Ripken **** face baseball bat.
[05:52.150 --> 05:56.930]  It's maybe like 1% baseball. It's 99% not baseball.
[05:57.290 --> 05:59.110]  Yeah, but that's a great gift.
[05:59.190 --> 06:03.850]  Yeah. You want to sell baseball cards, baseball, baseball bats, a jersey.
[06:04.090 --> 06:05.830]  I don't care about a jersey. Who said jersey?
[06:06.010 --> 06:06.910]  I don't know. I'm just adding.
[06:06.910 --> 06:09.990]  Listen, if you want to sell a jersey, I think it's a great idea. We'll sell a jersey, Gavin.
[06:10.330 --> 06:14.610]  I think little tiny baseball bats with the **** face logo on the bottom,
[06:14.690 --> 06:16.530]  where Billy Ripken wrote **** face would be...
[06:16.530 --> 06:19.330]  They would be a delight. We make a hundred of them. We'll sell them.
[06:19.610 --> 06:20.510]  It'll become a great thing.
[06:20.750 --> 06:22.930]  I think Andrew's afraid people are going to beat him to death with them.
[06:22.970 --> 06:26.070]  Yeah, I was going to say, I've never seen someone pitch something
[06:26.070 --> 06:28.870]  so excitedly that would arm the audience.
[06:29.010 --> 06:32.470]  It just seems like a terrible idea. I don't know why we'd do it.
[06:32.690 --> 06:34.570]  Did you intro this, by the way, before I got here?
[06:34.570 --> 06:36.950]  Oh, no, we didn't. I don't think...
[06:36.950 --> 06:39.970]  Somebody sent me a whole thing about how I was wrong about the no punting thing.
[06:40.190 --> 06:42.650]  So maybe I need to adjust my position on intros.
[06:42.890 --> 06:44.290]  What was the no punting thing?
[06:44.510 --> 06:47.530]  I said that... or always punt. The reversal of what I just said is what I meant.
[06:47.590 --> 06:48.570]  That you should always punt.
[06:48.850 --> 06:52.250]  But I guess that's flawed data based on high school games. So I don't know.
[06:52.330 --> 06:54.670]  Does that actually apply to whether we need an intro or not, though?
[06:54.750 --> 06:57.830]  My point was that people do things because it's the standard
[06:58.190 --> 07:00.590]  and not because it makes sense on occasion.
[07:00.730 --> 07:01.730]  I understand your point.
[07:01.850 --> 07:03.890]  It's like the granny shot. It's a way better free throw.
[07:04.770 --> 07:08.090]  Statistically and just the physics of the granny shot make way more sense.
[07:08.170 --> 07:11.390]  It has a higher probability of going in, but nobody does it because it looks dumb.
[07:11.610 --> 07:15.190]  Yeah, because athletes still want to get laid at the end of the day. That's the problem.
[07:15.370 --> 07:18.490]  My point is that there's a better way to do a thing that people don't do
[07:18.490 --> 07:20.750]  because it's the standard is to shoot the other way.
[07:21.330 --> 07:22.830]  What's the coolest thing you've done?
[07:23.190 --> 07:25.410]  When I was 27, I...
[07:27.330 --> 07:29.570]  Yeah, I was about 26 or 27.
[07:29.570 --> 07:35.610]  I started a global phenomenon new media production company.
[07:36.130 --> 07:40.490]  That's pretty cool. When I was seven, I won a bunch of tickets in an arcade
[07:40.490 --> 07:43.710]  and I got banned from the arcade. It was great.
[07:43.890 --> 07:45.610]  Wow, really? You won them legitimately?
[07:45.990 --> 07:50.590]  Oh, yeah. Well, sort of. They had this one machine where you'd put the token
[07:50.590 --> 07:53.810]  and it would go down a ramp and depending on where it landed on the ramp,
[07:53.890 --> 07:57.350]  you'd get a certain number of tickets. And I realized if you tilted it a certain way,
[07:57.350 --> 08:00.870]  you would always get 150 tickets. So that's all I did.
[08:01.210 --> 08:04.770]  I just killed them on this ramp game. And then they had this claw machine
[08:04.770 --> 08:08.310]  where you could go in and pick up these massive stacks of tickets.
[08:08.750 --> 08:12.790]  Nobody had ever won it before. I'm the first person to have ever won anything
[08:12.790 --> 08:15.190]  from that machine and they didn't know what to do with me.
[08:15.310 --> 08:18.710]  I got an alarm clock. I got six board games. I cleaned them out.
[08:19.710 --> 08:20.350]  That's awesome.
[08:20.490 --> 08:22.490]  I may have told this on the Rooster Teeth podcast years ago,
[08:22.610 --> 08:24.890]  but I think the coolest thing I've ever done still to this day,
[08:24.890 --> 08:27.970]  I was about 16 or something. I was in Tenerife,
[08:28.150 --> 08:32.910]  one of the Canary Islands and a bunch of sort of holiday friends and I were all together.
[08:33.370 --> 08:37.630]  And I was just kind of sat on a rock and a few of them were trying to throw a stone
[08:37.630 --> 08:40.930]  into this tiny hole, like way up on the side of the cliff.
[08:41.010 --> 08:43.990]  We were like down on a beach and there's like a hole in the cliff up above.
[08:44.270 --> 08:47.830]  And they were honestly trying to throw a stone into this hole for about
[08:47.830 --> 08:50.990]  maybe two and a half, three hours. And people were like winging the side,
[08:50.990 --> 08:57.030]  no one was really close. And there was this plastic chair that someone had smashed to pieces.
[08:57.510 --> 09:00.550]  And I just strolled up after like almost three hours of being like,
[09:00.570 --> 09:02.770]  oh, I'm sick of this. I'm just going to throw a stone in this and be done with it.
[09:03.090 --> 09:07.550]  I put a stone like in the plastic leg of the chair, like in the channel.
[09:07.730 --> 09:13.410]  And I did like a 360 spin and did like a high lie whip with this stone.
[09:13.510 --> 09:16.630]  And it shot hundreds of feet straight into this hole.
[09:17.310 --> 09:20.310]  And to this day, I don't think I've ever been so impressive.
[09:20.990 --> 09:23.210]  I think the moral of the story is Gavin and I are way cooler.
[09:23.430 --> 09:28.050]  No, totally. The only other thing I could say is one time I bought a, when I was a kid,
[09:28.570 --> 09:34.610]  gum was a bigger deal when I was a kid. Like all the gum now,
[09:36.170 --> 09:41.930]  dudes and ladies, people my age will agree with me. In the 80s, gum was a much bigger deal.
[09:42.230 --> 09:47.610]  Like Big League Chew, Hubba Bubba, Bubble Yum, Bubbalicious. It was always on TV.
[09:47.610 --> 09:53.050]  They were wild. It was always like mango, strawberries and banana cherry.
[09:53.310 --> 09:55.970]  And there were all these crazy flavors. Now it's just like fucking some
[09:55.970 --> 10:00.830]  flavor experiment or cinnamon to make you fucking breath feel better or whatever.
[10:01.030 --> 10:06.950]  But there was, there's no pizzazz. The golden era of gum as a kid is over.
[10:07.290 --> 10:11.170]  I defy you to go buy like a six pack of Hubba Bubba with wacky flavors.
[10:11.290 --> 10:14.010]  Now you can't do it. You can't go buy root beer flavored Bubbalicious.
[10:14.390 --> 10:17.090]  When I was a kid, that shit was the shit.
[10:17.090 --> 10:23.090]  So one time I bought a pack of Hubba Bubba and there was like a national...
[10:23.970 --> 10:26.690]  Do you guys know what the GoBots are?
[10:26.990 --> 10:27.210]  No.
[10:27.410 --> 10:28.550]  By name, I do.
[10:28.710 --> 10:30.490]  Okay. Do you know what Transformers are?
[10:30.610 --> 10:30.770]  Yeah.
[10:30.990 --> 10:31.250]  Yes.
[10:31.470 --> 10:36.470]  GoBots were the competitor to Transformers in the 80s. They had a cartoon. It was very popular.
[10:36.770 --> 10:40.510]  It was shitty. It wasn't as good as Transformers. It was like the poor man's Transformers, right?
[10:40.610 --> 10:43.670]  But they had some cool shit. Anyway, so there was like a GoBots competition
[10:43.670 --> 10:46.910]  where you could like enter in in the Hubba Bubba.
[10:47.250 --> 10:50.050]  And then if you win, I don't know, you win some GoBots or some shit.
[10:50.130 --> 10:55.010]  And I won first place. I entered in and I won first place in the Hubba Bubba GoBots thing.
[10:55.130 --> 10:56.290]  Was it just like a submission?
[10:56.590 --> 11:01.410]  Yeah. And I got a free, like four months later in the mail, I got a free GoBot.
[11:01.410 --> 11:02.510]  How much is a GoBot worth?
[11:02.650 --> 11:07.070]  Oh, I don't think it was worth a lot. Like 10 bucks. I don't know.
[11:07.150 --> 11:07.230]  Okay.
[11:07.410 --> 11:09.310]  It was a big deal to me. It was the only thing I ever won.
[11:09.430 --> 11:10.450]  That was the coolest thing you did?
[11:10.510 --> 11:11.350]  That's probably the coolest thing.
[11:11.350 --> 11:12.650]  Coolest thing I've ever...
[11:13.370 --> 11:14.850]  I was kidding about the Rooster Teeth thing.
[11:15.010 --> 11:16.850]  Rooster Teeth is one of the nerdier things I've ever done.
[11:17.710 --> 11:20.390]  Also, you didn't really just stroll up and start Rooster Teeth.
[11:20.690 --> 11:23.070]  It was more of a years-long process.
[11:23.950 --> 11:26.010]  It'd be funny if you could stand in front of a girl and be like,
[11:26.210 --> 11:28.070]  watch this, and then you start a company.
[11:30.470 --> 11:33.610]  It's like an Animal Crossing when you go to the DIY bench like...
[11:36.990 --> 11:38.270]  Here's 400 employee company.
[11:39.390 --> 11:41.930]  I think maybe I told this story on an RT podcast years ago,
[11:42.070 --> 11:44.370]  but when I lived in Jacksonville, Florida, I was maybe 10.
[11:44.830 --> 11:48.210]  All the kids in the summer would meet at this one kid's house,
[11:48.310 --> 11:51.170]  and we would all go ride bikes or throw rocks at each other or whatever.
[11:51.350 --> 11:52.770]  They're two kind of different things there.
[11:52.930 --> 11:55.310]  You didn't grow up in Florida in the 80s.
[11:56.750 --> 11:58.150]  Back when gum was cool.
[11:59.150 --> 12:00.610]  Back when gum was fucking cool.
[12:00.970 --> 12:03.450]  So one day I went over and all the kids were already there,
[12:03.450 --> 12:09.270]  and we had this huge six, maybe seven foot tall quarter pipe
[12:09.270 --> 12:11.190]  that one of the kids' older brothers made.
[12:12.750 --> 12:16.030]  It was too big for us to skateboard on because we were fucking shitty.
[12:16.530 --> 12:17.530]  Or too big to drop in on.
[12:17.570 --> 12:18.850]  We would skateboard on it, but not drop in on it.
[12:18.890 --> 12:21.330]  Anyway, all the kids were standing around on their bikes,
[12:21.390 --> 12:22.350]  and I go, hey, what are you guys doing?
[12:22.430 --> 12:24.550]  And they go, oh, we all just jumped this ramp.
[12:24.750 --> 12:25.910]  And I went, on what?
[12:25.990 --> 12:26.810]  And they're like, on our bikes.
[12:27.250 --> 12:29.290]  And I was like, but it's got like a foot of vert.
[12:29.410 --> 12:30.170]  How did you do it?
[12:30.250 --> 12:32.890]  And they're like, we went down the industry and got going really fast and did it.
[12:32.890 --> 12:35.170]  And I was like, wow, sorry, I missed that.
[12:35.290 --> 12:37.050]  And they're like, yeah, you really did miss it.
[12:37.130 --> 12:37.970]  It was really cool.
[12:38.010 --> 12:38.870]  And we're all really cool.
[12:39.010 --> 12:41.770]  And you're a pussy if you don't do it.
[12:41.810 --> 12:44.630]  And I was like, you know, use the parlance of the 80s.
[12:44.710 --> 12:45.970]  And I go, excuse me?
[12:46.070 --> 12:47.530]  And they're like, yeah, every one of us.
[12:47.570 --> 12:49.530]  They're like, even fucking that kid did it.
[12:49.550 --> 12:51.370]  I don't even remember who that kid was, but...
[12:51.370 --> 12:52.630]  And I was like, oh.
[12:52.870 --> 12:54.630]  And they're like, yeah, you're like, basically,
[12:54.630 --> 12:56.130]  you can't hang out with us if you don't do it.
[12:56.390 --> 12:57.870]  You're like, because we're all in the club now.
[12:58.110 --> 12:59.790]  And you're not cool unless you do it.
[12:59.950 --> 13:01.650]  Did you pull out Andrew and you're like, I did it.
[13:01.770 --> 13:02.270]  I already did it.
[13:02.270 --> 13:08.210]  No, I was like, I was like, fucking feeling the vice grip of peer pressure.
[13:08.330 --> 13:10.970]  And I was like, OK, I guess I'll do it.
[13:11.050 --> 13:12.770]  How far back should I go on my bike?
[13:13.070 --> 13:14.290]  And they're like, it takes a lot.
[13:14.370 --> 13:15.650]  Go down the end of the street.
[13:15.770 --> 13:18.630]  So I went all the way down to the end of the street, which was, by the way, my house.
[13:18.710 --> 13:19.670]  My house was at the end of the street.
[13:20.090 --> 13:22.450]  And I turned around and I rode my bike.
[13:22.470 --> 13:24.350]  And I thought, this is not a good idea.
[13:24.390 --> 13:25.630]  But what choice do I have?
[13:25.650 --> 13:27.410]  I won't have any friends if I don't do this.
[13:27.650 --> 13:28.750]  Like the whole neighborhood did it.
[13:28.930 --> 13:31.310]  I'll be the only kid in the neighborhood who didn't jump the ramp.
[13:31.310 --> 13:32.550]  Sweet old lady next door.
[13:32.670 --> 13:33.290]  She's already done it.
[13:33.370 --> 13:34.330]  Yeah, she's already done it.
[13:34.430 --> 13:34.650]  Yeah.
[13:34.910 --> 13:39.310]  And so I got on my little BMX and I pedaled my ass off and I went as far as I could at this thing.
[13:39.610 --> 13:41.090]  And I just, I'll be honest with you.
[13:41.250 --> 13:47.770]  I closed my eyes and I hit the ramp and my eyes squeezed entirely, like super shut.
[13:47.810 --> 13:50.070]  And I hit this like seven foot tall quarter pipe.
[13:50.530 --> 13:54.130]  And I felt the sensation of being in the air and my stomach dropping.
[13:54.550 --> 13:57.450]  And then I heard, kabam, kabam.
[13:57.790 --> 14:01.090]  And I opened my eyes and there was nothing but smoke.
[14:01.090 --> 14:02.150]  And white around me.
[14:02.210 --> 14:06.270]  And I swear to God, I thought, oh no, I died.
[14:06.390 --> 14:07.010]  Now I'm in heaven.
[14:08.250 --> 14:11.350]  Because I just saw white clouds and all I could see was white clouds.
[14:11.870 --> 14:14.530]  And for like four seconds, I was like, I'm dead.
[14:14.810 --> 14:16.490]  The ramp killed me and I'm in heaven.
[14:16.630 --> 14:18.450]  And I'm looking around like, what the fuck?
[14:18.470 --> 14:19.130]  I'm dead.
[14:19.250 --> 14:20.770]  I'm in, like, is this purgatory?
[14:21.070 --> 14:22.150]  Like, where do I go?
[14:22.490 --> 14:23.510]  And the smoke cleared away.
[14:23.910 --> 14:24.850]  And I realized...
[14:24.850 --> 14:25.910]  Buenos dias!
[14:26.190 --> 14:31.050]  Café Bustelo Espresso-styled iced coffee is hitting refrigerators with a cold front
[14:31.050 --> 14:32.670]  that'll sweep through your senses.

[15:28.410 --> 15:31.850]  Mobile speeds reduced to max 1.5 megabits per second after 20 gigabits per month use.

[15:34.250 --> 15:35.110]  Other restrictions may apply.
[15:35.210 --> 15:38.210]  What happened was, I launched so high and so far into the air,
[15:38.510 --> 15:42.810]  and I came up, I basically, I leveled out, and then I came straight down seven feet,
[15:43.050 --> 15:44.330]  popped both of my tires.
[15:45.370 --> 15:46.170]  Which created...
[15:46.170 --> 15:46.850]  Both of them.
[15:46.890 --> 15:48.870]  Both front and back tire just exploded.
[15:48.870 --> 15:53.030]  There was tons of just fucking debris and smoke, I guess, from that.
[15:53.130 --> 15:53.490]  I don't know.
[15:53.770 --> 15:55.230]  And like dust from it being Florida.
[15:55.450 --> 15:59.110]  And I just assumed that I had died because my eyes were closed and I didn't see what happened.
[15:59.390 --> 16:01.830]  And all the kids had their fucking jaws open.
[16:02.190 --> 16:03.550]  And I was like, am I alive?
[16:04.790 --> 16:06.150]  The coolest thing to say.
[16:06.350 --> 16:07.890]  And they're like, oh my god.
[16:07.930 --> 16:08.550]  And I'm like, what?
[16:08.610 --> 16:10.190]  And they're like, I can't believe you did it.
[16:10.230 --> 16:11.150]  And I'm like, well, of course I did it.
[16:11.170 --> 16:11.690]  You guys did it.
[16:11.710 --> 16:12.270]  I didn't have a choice.
[16:12.310 --> 16:13.230]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[16:13.250 --> 16:14.550]  We were all too scared to do it.
[16:14.630 --> 16:15.270]  Nobody would do it.
[16:15.330 --> 16:17.410]  We just thought we could trick you into doing it.
[16:17.550 --> 16:18.430]  And I was like, oh.
[16:18.430 --> 16:20.950]  And then for that summer, I was the coolest kid on the street.
[16:21.130 --> 16:22.670]  I mean, that is the best outcome for them.
[16:22.850 --> 16:25.110]  Like they watched you just ride away from them.
[16:25.350 --> 16:26.750]  And then there was an explosion.
[16:27.150 --> 16:27.510]  Yeah.
[16:28.390 --> 16:34.330]  And then I didn't have a bike for like a month because I didn't have tires.
[16:34.690 --> 16:37.230]  I had to get my mom to take me to the store and she was not about it.
[16:37.310 --> 16:39.010]  I like that for once you were really popular,
[16:39.130 --> 16:41.330]  but you couldn't go and hang out with them because your bike was gone.
[16:41.510 --> 16:42.570]  Yeah, because my bike was useless.
[16:42.750 --> 16:44.810]  That same fucking bike one time I was riding it.
[16:44.990 --> 16:47.370]  And the day I got a Walkman for my birthday,
[16:47.370 --> 16:49.770]  I got my first Walkman and my first tape.
[16:49.890 --> 16:52.070]  The tape was John Cougar, American Fool.
[16:52.450 --> 16:54.590]  And so I was listening to Jack and Diana riding my bike,
[16:54.730 --> 16:56.870]  going as fast as I could with my headphones on.
[16:57.070 --> 17:03.650]  And the handlebars came off and I fell forward and drove over myself and smashed the...
[17:03.650 --> 17:06.930]  The day I got it on my birthday, smashed my Walkman.
[17:07.070 --> 17:07.370]  Same bike.
[17:07.730 --> 17:12.270]  I appreciate that all three of our coolest moment stories are essentially an accident.
[17:12.630 --> 17:15.370]  It was a thing we didn't mean to pull off, but it happened.
[17:15.590 --> 17:16.670]  There's no skill involved.
[17:16.670 --> 17:19.410]  Just gullibility and luck.
[17:19.590 --> 17:21.010]  Yes, the most important of things.
[17:25.650 --> 17:27.010]  Hey, what's up? It's Geoff.
[17:27.310 --> 17:31.710]  I recommend, these are my words by the way, The Social Dilemma on Netflix.
[17:32.330 --> 17:33.490]  Why, do you ask?
[17:33.770 --> 17:38.090]  Well, in the documentary, Tech Insiders explain how social media is engineered
[17:38.090 --> 17:40.450]  to exploit users' data for profit.
[17:40.990 --> 17:42.970]  They call it surveillance capitalism.
[17:43.490 --> 17:45.130]  I'm cool with normal capitalism.
[17:45.410 --> 17:46.810]  That's how I have a job.
[17:46.930 --> 17:47.990]  It's how most of us do.
[17:47.990 --> 17:51.730]  I'm a willing participant of the transaction every time I go to the store to buy food.
[17:52.010 --> 17:55.470]  But when my data is being harvested so tech billionaires can get even richer,
[17:55.830 --> 17:56.890]  that's where I draw the line.
[17:57.230 --> 18:01.270]  And that is why I put a layer of protection around my data.
[18:01.510 --> 18:03.190]  And I use ExpressVPN.
[18:03.750 --> 18:07.370]  Every time you use the internet, big tech companies mine your data by tracking your
[18:07.370 --> 18:09.690]  searches, messages, and video history.
[18:09.830 --> 18:13.550]  But when you run ExpressVPN on your device, it hides your IP address,
[18:13.690 --> 18:16.230]  which websites can use to personally identify you.
[18:16.230 --> 18:19.850]  That makes your activity more difficult to trace and sell to advertisers.
[18:20.430 --> 18:22.590]  You still need to be careful with what you share on social media,
[18:22.990 --> 18:25.890]  but ExpressVPN can make your web browsing more anonymous.
[18:26.330 --> 18:32.150]  ExpressVPN also encrypts 100% of your internet data to keep you safe from hackers and prying eyes.
[18:32.530 --> 18:35.130]  Many VPNs slow down your internet, but not ExpressVPN.
[18:35.450 --> 18:37.290]  It's incredibly fast and easy to use.
[18:37.490 --> 18:39.190]  Just tap one button and you're protected.
[18:39.550 --> 18:42.950]  So if you don't like the idea of tech companies exploiting your personal information,
[18:42.950 --> 18:47.430]  then visit ExpressVPN.com slash face right now,
[18:47.510 --> 18:50.610]  and you can get three extra months of ExpressVPN for free.
[18:50.930 --> 18:57.590]  That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com slash face to protect your data.
[18:57.870 --> 19:01.350]  Go to ExpressVPN.com slash face to learn more.
[19:02.130 --> 19:03.190]  Hey, butthole.
[19:03.630 --> 19:04.710]  No, not your butthole.
[19:04.810 --> 19:06.490]  I'm talking to you, butthole.
[19:06.730 --> 19:07.390]  Yes, you, butthole.
[19:07.830 --> 19:08.930]  You've got a butthole, right?
[19:09.450 --> 19:11.270]  Well, then this ad is for you.
[19:11.270 --> 19:14.050]  It's hard to believe that when we go to the bathroom in this country,
[19:14.230 --> 19:15.870]  most of us wipe instead of wash.
[19:16.010 --> 19:19.030]  It really is a kind of a uniquely American thing.
[19:19.210 --> 19:23.030]  We consider ourselves to be so culturally elite, typically,
[19:23.450 --> 19:29.170]  but the rest of the world has kind of figured out that dry wiping is not the same as washing.
[19:29.610 --> 19:30.410]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[19:30.750 --> 19:32.150]  Bidets have existed in America.
[19:32.290 --> 19:34.970]  They've been around forever, but they've been very, very expensive.
[19:35.050 --> 19:39.570]  And I think that has been a barrier to entry for most people's barriers.
[19:40.270 --> 19:41.330]  See what I did there?
[19:41.730 --> 19:43.930]  But that's not the case anymore thanks to Hello Tushy.
[19:44.210 --> 19:46.010]  They've democratized butthole cleaning.
[19:46.450 --> 19:49.870]  Now you can get an attachment that fits over your existing toilet
[19:49.870 --> 19:52.770]  for mere pennies on the butthole dollar.
[19:53.210 --> 19:57.710]  Hello Tushy cleans your butt with a precise stream of fresh water for just $79.
[19:59.350 --> 20:02.550]  That's incredibly cheap compared to some of the other bidets out there.
[20:02.790 --> 20:05.790]  I know because I'm a longtime bidet shopper.
[20:06.290 --> 20:09.130]  And it's an expensive game to get into, or at least it was.
[20:09.570 --> 20:10.470]  Until Hello Tushy.
[20:10.890 --> 20:13.190]  So ditch paper products and uncomfortable chafing
[20:13.190 --> 20:17.830]  when you switch to the soothing, cleansing stream of water from a Hello Tushy bidet attachment.
[20:17.930 --> 20:22.430]  You've heard me talk about bidets and my butthole for a while now.
[20:22.530 --> 20:24.570]  This shouldn't come as a surprise or a shock.
[20:24.650 --> 20:27.090]  And if it is, you haven't been paying attention.
[20:27.550 --> 20:30.890]  I talk about my butthole health and welfare constantly.
[20:30.930 --> 20:31.930]  It's important to me.
[20:32.230 --> 20:34.250]  I spend a lot of my life sitting on that butthole.
[20:34.370 --> 20:35.190]  I gotta take care of it.
[20:35.410 --> 20:36.930]  I want it to be clean and fresh.
[20:37.190 --> 20:38.310]  I don't want it to be rashy.
[20:38.310 --> 20:39.490]  I don't want it to be dry.
[20:39.670 --> 20:40.850]  I don't want it to be chafed.
[20:41.290 --> 20:42.890]  I treat it like the king that it is.
[20:43.250 --> 20:47.270]  Also, every Hello Tushy bidet attachment comes with a 60-day risk-free guarantee

[21:16.970 --> 21:19.630]  I, uh, made a NFL bet like two weeks ago.
[21:19.770 --> 21:20.970]  That was almost the worst thing.
[21:21.110 --> 21:22.790]  This is your big financial calamity, right?
[21:22.970 --> 21:23.310]  Yeah.
[21:23.630 --> 21:24.730]  It was a calam-
[21:24.730 --> 21:25.670]  Well, okay.
[21:25.910 --> 21:28.930]  So there's this football pool I play in sometimes
[21:28.930 --> 21:31.530]  and you have to guess who will win the games.
[21:31.730 --> 21:35.110]  And if you get every game right, you win whatever the pool is.
[21:35.250 --> 21:36.790]  Is this why you were crying the other day?
[21:37.030 --> 21:37.330]  Yes.
[21:37.330 --> 21:38.610]  Yes, it was.
[21:40.330 --> 21:44.570]  And so I thought, oh, I'll go in this, uh, right now, whatever.
[21:44.690 --> 21:45.110]  It's 2am.
[21:45.230 --> 21:46.070]  I'll just make a card.
[21:46.210 --> 21:50.870]  It's like a $95,000 pool, which is way more than what it typically is.
[21:50.990 --> 21:51.770]  I'll enter this.
[21:51.870 --> 21:52.810]  I feel really good.
[21:52.870 --> 21:53.810]  I thought about my picks.
[21:54.010 --> 21:58.370]  I made my card, submitted it, and then I was showing it to Eric the next day.
[21:58.510 --> 22:03.010]  And when I was showing it to Eric, I realized I picked the opposite of what I wanted on one
[22:03.010 --> 22:03.590]  of the spaces.
[22:03.850 --> 22:07.150]  And it was like the worst team, the worst team in that area.
[22:07.150 --> 22:09.550]  Like it was by far the biggest underdog pick I could make.
[22:09.890 --> 22:11.610]  So my card was essentially useless.
[22:11.830 --> 22:16.230]  But then I was in this dilemma of, well, do I buy a new card just to be wrong?
[22:16.270 --> 22:18.270]  Because I'm almost certainly not going to win this.
[22:18.330 --> 22:19.710]  Or do I just live with it?
[22:19.750 --> 22:20.030]  Whatever.
[22:20.190 --> 22:22.330]  What are the odds that I get the card right?
[22:22.590 --> 22:23.910]  Except for that one pick.
[22:24.010 --> 22:29.550]  And then as the games progressed, every single miracle in football happened that weekend,
[22:29.550 --> 22:31.330]  and it kept making my card win.
[22:31.550 --> 22:34.170]  It's the only time I never win ever.
[22:34.530 --> 22:36.550]  It's the but every time I was unstoppable.
[22:36.550 --> 22:37.870]  I was on a winning streak.
[22:38.010 --> 22:39.330]  Every game was turning my way.
[22:39.770 --> 22:41.130]  Onside kicks, getting recovered.
[22:41.230 --> 22:42.050]  That never happens.
[22:42.310 --> 22:43.430]  Just crazy comebacks.
[22:43.830 --> 22:44.470]  It was ridiculous.
[22:44.990 --> 22:46.810]  But every time they won, it just hurt more.
[22:47.110 --> 22:51.770]  It's the only time in my life where winning was extremely painful with every game.
[22:52.070 --> 22:55.890]  And it came down to the final game, which was the Raiders versus the Saints.
[22:56.230 --> 22:59.890]  And the Saints were projected to blow out the Raiders, but they lost.
[23:00.310 --> 23:03.910]  And so I didn't have to live with the fact that I would have lost whatever money that
[23:03.910 --> 23:04.630]  card would win.
[23:04.790 --> 23:05.510]  What would it have won you?
[23:05.510 --> 23:07.430]  Turns out it was only like a thousand dollars.
[23:07.610 --> 23:08.090]  Oh, OK.
[23:08.230 --> 23:12.310]  Eight hundred, maybe like it wasn't life changing money, but I didn't know that at the time.
[23:12.430 --> 23:14.910]  So that many other people got it right, too?
[23:15.090 --> 23:19.510]  Yeah, I think like 70 people got it right under the assumption the Raiders would win,
[23:19.630 --> 23:20.810]  which is was rare.
[23:20.970 --> 23:25.050]  So you'd have to think it'd probably be like doubled what they won if the Saints won.
[23:25.490 --> 23:26.290]  There'd be even less.
[23:26.410 --> 23:27.470]  But yeah, it was just miserable.
[23:27.510 --> 23:29.810]  I've never been so happy to be a loser.
[23:30.090 --> 23:34.370]  Like I was just cheering nonstop that the bet I made completely failed.
[23:34.430 --> 23:35.410]  It's the happiest I've been.
[23:35.410 --> 23:38.230]  I don't know if I could have watched football if the Saints wouldn't won that game.
[23:38.450 --> 23:41.810]  What would you have done if it was like you were going to get the entire pool and you
[23:41.810 --> 23:43.130]  lost because of that error?
[23:43.430 --> 23:45.170]  What if you lost like 90 grand?
[23:45.490 --> 23:48.030]  I would have just I would have I don't know what I would have done.
[23:48.150 --> 23:49.590]  I would have walked the streets aimlessly.
[23:49.950 --> 23:52.390]  I probably would have cried in a McDonald's at one point.
[23:53.790 --> 23:55.250]  There'd be a lot of soul searching.
[23:55.510 --> 23:57.250]  I don't think I could watch football ever again.
[23:57.530 --> 23:58.810]  I would be a changed person.
[23:59.010 --> 24:01.170]  You'd wipe the tears away with your favorite carrot muffin.
[24:01.330 --> 24:04.630]  I feel like that we need to prevent this kind of thing from happening at all costs,
[24:04.630 --> 24:09.730]  because the more damaged you get as a person, Andrew, the more dangerous you become to everyone
[24:09.730 --> 24:10.070]  else.
[24:10.230 --> 24:10.370]  Yeah.
[24:10.510 --> 24:12.810]  So it's really good for all of us that...
[24:12.810 --> 24:14.210]  I think it's actually reverse.
[24:14.690 --> 24:16.850]  I don't want to do anything if I'm sad.
[24:17.290 --> 24:20.830]  I think the happier I am, the more I want to fuck with everybody.
[24:21.290 --> 24:22.750]  I think it's flipped.
[24:23.270 --> 24:26.170]  Andrew, you made me sad for the first time on F*** Face.
[24:26.290 --> 24:27.270]  I got bummed out.
[24:27.390 --> 24:28.230]  Yeah, me too.
[24:28.470 --> 24:29.450]  Why is that a sad thing?
[24:29.510 --> 24:30.970]  That was just so real, wasn't it?
[24:31.010 --> 24:31.730]  That's real?
[24:31.730 --> 24:32.830]  What do you mean?
[24:33.270 --> 24:35.070]  Andrew, I wish I could hug you right now.
[24:35.370 --> 24:36.790]  I didn't know that was a sad thing.
[24:36.890 --> 24:37.830]  That was really sad.
[24:37.930 --> 24:41.990]  No, I'm saying that I get joy in doing pranks and like messing with people.
[24:42.270 --> 24:44.750]  So if I was miserable, I wouldn't have that joy.
[24:44.850 --> 24:46.090]  So why would I do those things?
[24:46.270 --> 24:48.910]  Yeah, I just was imagining you just completely without purpose,
[24:49.190 --> 24:52.350]  crying in a McDonald's that may or may not have had a basement.
[24:52.590 --> 24:53.870]  Like a nerdy little Lex Luthor.
[24:54.130 --> 24:55.210]  No, that was...
[24:55.210 --> 24:55.670]  I apologize.
[24:55.870 --> 24:56.950]  That wasn't meant to be a sad thing.
[24:57.530 --> 25:00.490]  You don't have to apologize for being sad.
[25:00.490 --> 25:01.930]  I didn't think that was a sad thing.
[25:02.050 --> 25:03.050]  I feel like reverse.
[25:03.170 --> 25:05.050]  I feel like if anything, that was supposed to be like,
[25:05.110 --> 25:08.710]  I'm an asshole because I enjoy messing with you guys.
[25:08.890 --> 25:12.690]  Well, maybe in that case, you can put a disclaimer on the front of this episode.
[25:12.810 --> 25:14.210]  Be like, look, guys, I'm a prick.
[25:14.330 --> 25:14.970]  I'm an arsehole.
[25:16.590 --> 25:17.730]  That's a great idea, actually.
[25:18.590 --> 25:19.610]  Waluigi is my god.
[25:19.930 --> 25:20.590]  I worship him.
[25:20.690 --> 25:24.190]  That was an interesting back away from the heel roll that you took, I feel like.
[25:24.230 --> 25:24.930]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:25.010 --> 25:25.430]  What do you mean?
[25:25.610 --> 25:27.290]  You know, you were doing a good job of being a heel.
[25:27.430 --> 25:29.770]  Yeah, but I know it's I mean, it's complicated.
[25:29.770 --> 25:34.990]  Like there were I had honestly never heard the word gaslighting before until after that came out.
[25:35.250 --> 25:37.370]  I just thought I was so wrong.
[25:37.450 --> 25:43.370]  Like to be so clearly in the wrong and to deny it was so absurd that it was funny.
[25:43.490 --> 25:46.830]  But I'd never heard of gaslighting or any of that stuff.
[25:46.850 --> 25:50.410]  And I think it weirdly tapped into like political feelings people have,
[25:50.530 --> 25:53.510]  which is the sad statement of what's happening in politics.
[25:53.790 --> 25:57.170]  But yeah, no, it's just that I had a blind spot for that.
[25:57.170 --> 25:59.990]  I didn't realize until you showed me the clip that it was based on
[25:59.990 --> 26:03.930]  that UFC guy that you said was just denying his own voice.
[26:04.150 --> 26:06.330]  Yeah, it was a dumb joke.
[26:06.430 --> 26:09.810]  Like it's a UFC reference from 2010 that nobody remembers.
[26:10.150 --> 26:14.890]  This person said a horrible statement that Lance Armstrong gave himself cancer
[26:14.890 --> 26:16.210]  by taking steroids.
[26:16.530 --> 26:20.350]  And then he was called on it and he refused that he ever said it.
[26:20.690 --> 26:23.330]  And then he went on a radio show and the person said, well, we have the clip.
[26:23.410 --> 26:24.490]  We'd like to play you the clip.
[26:24.570 --> 26:26.010]  Could you could you respond to this?
[26:26.010 --> 26:28.890]  And they play it and it is so clearly him.
[26:28.970 --> 26:30.670]  Like it's undeniably him.
[26:30.830 --> 26:31.070]  It is.
[26:31.230 --> 26:34.810]  And as soon as they go back to him, he says, that sounds nothing like me.
[26:34.870 --> 26:36.270]  You need to get the callers in here.
[26:36.350 --> 26:39.430]  Not a single one of them will think that that is my voice.
[26:39.570 --> 26:41.570]  That person sounds like they're a different ethnicity.
[26:42.030 --> 26:43.050]  That's not me at all.
[26:43.250 --> 26:44.550]  He was like, no, definitely not me.
[26:44.670 --> 26:47.370]  No, that's clearly like a Hispanic voice.
[26:47.670 --> 26:50.470]  And it's just exactly the same voice that's currently talking.
[26:50.730 --> 26:51.870]  Who was that that did it?
[26:51.870 --> 26:54.870]  Chael Sonnen is like a massive troll in MMA.
[26:55.330 --> 26:59.070]  But the absurdity of the denial I always thought was hilarious.
[26:59.230 --> 27:02.550]  So when Gavin presented me the audio, which is so clearly me,
[27:02.590 --> 27:04.170]  it's just where my brain immediately went.
[27:04.330 --> 27:04.990]  It was very funny.
[27:05.310 --> 27:05.970]  How about you, Gavin?
[27:06.070 --> 27:07.770]  You drop any water bottles or anything this week?
[27:07.910 --> 27:09.910]  No, I'm still wearing the shorts.
[27:10.030 --> 27:11.490]  I realized that I smashed the spare button.
[27:11.690 --> 27:13.390]  So all good on the shorts front.
[27:13.550 --> 27:14.210]  Oh, that's nice.
[27:14.390 --> 27:15.130]  Thanks for asking, though.
[27:15.250 --> 27:16.350]  Yeah, I'm similarly.
[27:16.470 --> 27:19.730]  I've had a very faceless week.
[27:19.730 --> 27:23.190]  I even did the root canal. It was fine. No pain, no nothing.
[27:23.390 --> 27:23.730]  That's great.
[27:23.870 --> 27:24.570]  So you're all sorted now?
[27:24.730 --> 27:25.750]  No, I gotta go back.
[27:26.690 --> 27:30.390]  I gotta go back in three weeks to get my crown put on.
[27:30.530 --> 27:33.870]  I still have like a temporary tooth over the root canal.
[27:34.010 --> 27:35.630]  I expect it to be eight weeks long.
[27:35.890 --> 27:37.670]  I don't remember every procedure you said,
[27:37.730 --> 27:40.190]  but when you explained to us in the past what you needed done,
[27:40.250 --> 27:42.610]  it felt like at least eight weeks of continuous work.
[27:42.970 --> 27:45.570]  Yeah, well, you know, by the time I get it on,
[27:45.710 --> 27:48.630]  it'll be like a three month ordeal from start to finish, I think.
[27:48.630 --> 27:51.630]  I just realized when I brought up earlier whether or not we'd done the intro
[27:51.630 --> 27:53.450]  like 15 minutes into the episode.
[27:54.170 --> 27:56.890]  It didn't even cause the intro to happen there.
[27:57.010 --> 27:58.450]  No, I give up fighting.
[27:58.630 --> 27:59.590]  Andrew beat me down.
[27:59.710 --> 28:00.690]  But he said he was wrong.
[28:00.790 --> 28:01.490]  Yeah, I agree.
[28:01.550 --> 28:03.330]  I was saying that I shouldn't have done that.
[28:03.590 --> 28:04.910]  I was wrong about the intro.
[28:05.070 --> 28:07.250]  I agree you were wrong about it, but you beat it out of me now.
[28:07.310 --> 28:07.870]  It's up to you.
[28:07.990 --> 28:09.270]  If you guys want to do an intro, go ahead.
[28:09.370 --> 28:10.470]  I mean, there's no point now.
[28:10.610 --> 28:11.210]  Well, I agree.
[28:11.310 --> 28:11.910]  What's the point?
[28:12.110 --> 28:15.590]  Geoff, did you cycle through a face in section this week?
[28:15.670 --> 28:17.790]  What do you call that thing where the ghost laid you down?
[28:17.790 --> 28:19.550]  Oh, the gentle...
[28:20.130 --> 28:22.670]  I got haunted by a gentle ghost.
[28:22.730 --> 28:23.310]  Is that what you're talking about?
[28:23.390 --> 28:24.130]  Yeah, on the bike.
[28:24.450 --> 28:25.790]  Oh, did I go through that intersection?
[28:26.110 --> 28:27.410]  Yeah, I went through this morning.
[28:27.490 --> 28:29.310]  Any supernatural activity?
[28:29.830 --> 28:30.150]  Nothing.
[28:30.310 --> 28:31.330]  Not a goddamn thing.
[28:31.410 --> 28:33.590]  I even rode by your house two days ago.
[28:33.610 --> 28:33.890]  Okay.
[28:34.730 --> 28:35.370]  Seemed fine.
[28:35.490 --> 28:35.790]  Okay.
[28:35.950 --> 28:36.970]  I didn't stop by or anything.
[28:37.530 --> 28:39.850]  Just wanted to mention you appear to still live there.
[28:40.030 --> 28:40.350]  Congratulations.
[28:40.630 --> 28:40.950]  I do, yeah.
[28:41.490 --> 28:44.430]  Yeah, no, I've been through that intersection a ton of times since then.
[28:44.810 --> 28:45.710]  Oh, I don't know.
[28:45.830 --> 28:47.930]  12 times since that last recording?
[28:48.190 --> 28:48.430]  Nothing.
[28:48.710 --> 28:49.810]  No, I have a thing.
[28:49.950 --> 28:50.850]  I have a thing to talk about.
[28:50.930 --> 28:51.810]  I forgot about this.
[28:51.970 --> 28:52.170]  Okay.
[28:52.250 --> 28:52.790]  I was wrong.
[28:52.950 --> 28:54.550]  I need to admit I was wrong about something.
[28:54.650 --> 28:55.150]  Oh, God.
[28:55.230 --> 28:57.830]  We had our big fruit bag conversation yesterday.
[28:58.070 --> 28:59.290]  Or not yesterday, last episode.
[28:59.410 --> 29:00.150]  Jesus, not yesterday.
[29:00.330 --> 29:00.930]  Fruit bag?
[29:01.050 --> 29:03.510]  We had an argument about is it a container?
[29:03.670 --> 29:04.570]  Is it not a container?
[29:04.750 --> 29:06.130]  And I tweeted it out and I said,
[29:06.250 --> 29:08.910]  there's zero chance a single person calls this the container.
[29:09.010 --> 29:09.550]  And someone did.
[29:09.730 --> 29:10.250]  You were right.
[29:10.370 --> 29:10.990]  I was wrong.
[29:11.310 --> 29:11.670]  Gav.
[29:12.430 --> 29:12.790]  Gav.
[29:13.310 --> 29:14.050]  What do we do?
[29:14.510 --> 29:16.010]  Andrew, what do you think has happened here?
[29:16.190 --> 29:16.570]  I don't know.
[29:16.770 --> 29:17.970]  This is alarming, though.
[29:18.130 --> 29:18.850]  I don't like this.
[29:20.330 --> 29:21.070]  What happened?
[29:21.450 --> 29:21.970]  Tell him, Geoff.
[29:22.210 --> 29:27.670]  Well, it's possible that we posted the image on the Instagram account.
[29:28.310 --> 29:33.510]  And in the comments, Gavin might have, with some leading comments,
[29:33.670 --> 29:36.250]  encouraged people to use to put those words together.
[29:36.570 --> 29:37.590]  Didn't you as well?
[29:37.750 --> 29:40.850]  It's possible I did as well, but we're not talking about me, we're talking about you.
[29:41.590 --> 29:43.330]  It's possible I did it first.
[29:43.330 --> 29:45.090]  Let me find the post while you tell it.
[29:45.230 --> 29:49.890]  So now I can't confirm that they got the word container in their head,
[29:49.950 --> 29:53.350]  because it's once again possible I said fruit container,
[29:53.530 --> 29:55.750]  and it's possible Gavin said container.
[29:56.030 --> 30:03.330]  We don't know for sure that that person read that and then transposed that over to you.
[30:03.710 --> 30:06.830]  But, you know, the timeline adds up pretty well.
[30:06.930 --> 30:08.250]  So the image was posted.
[30:08.510 --> 30:11.270]  Geoff immediately commented, probably the second comment,
[30:11.910 --> 30:14.790]  it looks like some sort of fruit container to me.
[30:15.170 --> 30:17.550]  I was like the fifth comment, and I wrote,
[30:17.850 --> 30:20.590]  well, it's containing the fruit, fruit container.
[30:20.970 --> 30:23.930]  And then I think that has then spread onto Twitter.
[30:24.110 --> 30:27.050]  And then you screenshot the Twitter thing and you're like, well, I'll be damned.
[30:29.450 --> 30:33.630]  I will say, I did press this person on why they said container.
[30:33.810 --> 30:35.950]  And if they got it from YouTube, they did not break.
[30:36.230 --> 30:37.630]  Wow, I'm impressed.
[30:37.750 --> 30:38.190]  That's great.
[30:38.190 --> 30:41.890]  I asked what region they were from because I thought maybe this is a weird regional thing.
[30:42.190 --> 30:43.650]  And what made them say that?
[30:43.730 --> 30:46.070]  And it just it felt like they were just trying to make a joke.
[30:46.390 --> 30:49.790]  But if they got it from YouTube, they did not indicate that in any way.
[30:49.970 --> 30:52.450]  On a similar line, did you see what Geoff found in his book?
[30:53.110 --> 30:53.730]  That's true.
[30:53.950 --> 30:58.450]  I texted you guys a picture today from the book I'm reading, the new Robert Galbraith book.
[30:58.610 --> 30:59.890]  Oh, I changed my number.
[31:00.170 --> 31:01.170]  So I didn't see that.
[31:01.490 --> 31:04.090]  What? Are you fucking serious?
[31:04.510 --> 31:05.450]  Yeah, I changed my number.
[31:05.510 --> 31:07.170]  I don't I don't know where that went.
[31:07.170 --> 31:08.170]  Why don't you tell us?
[31:08.330 --> 31:09.370]  I probably should have.
[31:10.490 --> 31:13.210]  So you've got multiple numbers, multiple slacks, multiple emails.
[31:13.370 --> 31:15.890]  How do we ever know if you're seeing anything we write?
[31:16.070 --> 31:18.070]  I only have like one real phone number.
[31:18.190 --> 31:19.650]  I just I changed it recently.
[31:20.950 --> 31:24.950]  And so the number I text you all the time isn't you anymore.
[31:25.310 --> 31:27.330]  Oh, no, no, Andrew.
[31:27.810 --> 31:29.850]  Does that mean you missed the last couple of farts as well?
[31:29.930 --> 31:30.410]  What farts?
[31:30.670 --> 31:31.930]  Oh, I'm I'm trying to find out.
[31:31.990 --> 31:34.810]  I'm scrolling back to see when was the last time Andrew responded from this number.
[31:35.070 --> 31:35.470]  Oh no.
[31:35.730 --> 31:36.670]  It's been a little bit.
[31:36.670 --> 31:37.830]  You've done it again.
[31:38.810 --> 31:41.290]  You know, I actually I thought about yesterday.
[31:41.530 --> 31:43.510]  Should I text them that I changed my number?
[31:43.630 --> 31:45.310]  And I said, yes, much like the intro.
[31:45.430 --> 31:48.150]  I was like, yeah, it's a good idea that I just kept on moving.
[31:48.250 --> 31:49.430]  Moved on right by that thought.
[31:49.610 --> 31:51.050]  August, end of August.
[31:51.290 --> 31:53.690]  Yeah, it's been like a week, maybe.
[31:53.870 --> 31:54.610]  It hasn't been that long.
[31:54.950 --> 31:58.370]  The last thing you said was my legal defense discord is like
[31:58.370 --> 32:01.390]  if the Farrelly brothers tried to write a John Grisham novel.
[32:02.750 --> 32:04.330]  Yeah, that's factually correct.
[32:04.330 --> 32:07.790]  I texted to Gavin and the person that got your number.
[32:08.130 --> 32:10.250]  Am I still I'm in the convert here.
[32:10.490 --> 32:12.030]  An excerpt from a book I'm reading.
[32:12.170 --> 32:13.030]  Wait, can you find Andrew?
[32:13.190 --> 32:14.170]  Is it in our group chat?
[32:14.370 --> 32:14.510]  Yeah.
[32:14.650 --> 32:15.730]  I'm just going to test.
[32:15.950 --> 32:18.630]  If not, I can paste it into the discord and you can and you can read.
[32:18.750 --> 32:20.170]  Wait, did a new number just get added?
[32:20.630 --> 32:20.950]  No.
[32:21.130 --> 32:22.270]  Oh, I'm still in here.
[32:22.370 --> 32:22.830]  This is weird.
[32:22.890 --> 32:25.590]  It's like I'm in my own thing now, but it still shows.
[32:25.730 --> 32:26.670]  I got a new one now.
[32:26.770 --> 32:27.950]  So this is now you.
[32:28.070 --> 32:28.770]  This is now me.
[32:28.910 --> 32:31.450]  OK, so Geoff, send him the picture on that one.
[32:31.630 --> 32:34.190]  Anyway, it's a page from the new Robert Galbraith novel.
[32:34.730 --> 32:39.130]  Troubled Blood, which is supposedly a little controversial, a little problematic.
[32:39.330 --> 32:40.290]  But I haven't gotten to that part yet.
[32:40.470 --> 32:44.310]  Robin Ellicott is referring to spending the night in a hotel.
[32:44.370 --> 32:45.170]  She wasn't planning on it.
[32:45.210 --> 32:46.910]  So all she had with her was her backpack.
[32:47.130 --> 32:49.270]  So she didn't have stuff like her toothbrush and whatnot.
[32:49.350 --> 32:50.330]  So she feels a little dirty.
[32:50.490 --> 32:53.630]  I'm not setting some some you want some color to this.
[32:53.730 --> 32:57.690]  So she said her backpack contained only what items she carried on her surveillance job.
[32:57.950 --> 32:59.950]  Item number one, a beanie hat.
[33:00.390 --> 33:02.850]  I said I was willing to admit I was wrong on that.
[33:02.850 --> 33:05.790]  I feel like all hats have a hard brim of some kind.
[33:06.830 --> 33:09.210]  Maybe this is the proof that I am definitely wrong.
[33:09.310 --> 33:10.890]  I was less confident about that one.
[33:11.390 --> 33:14.150]  I feel very strongly a container has a lid.
[33:14.590 --> 33:19.430]  But the beanie not being a hat, I'm less serious about.
[33:19.510 --> 33:20.970]  What's a bag with a lid then?
[33:21.670 --> 33:22.470]  What do you mean?
[33:23.290 --> 33:25.210]  Have you ever seen a bag with a lid?
[33:25.450 --> 33:26.690]  You're talking about a seal.
[33:26.830 --> 33:31.070]  No, imagine like one of those plastic tubs you get, like a small crate with a lid, right?
[33:31.070 --> 33:35.170]  Imagine you got you got the lid, you got the rim and then everything below that is a bag.
[33:35.650 --> 33:36.250]  What's that?
[33:36.790 --> 33:37.730]  That doesn't exist.
[33:37.910 --> 33:39.890]  What are you talking about?
[33:40.150 --> 33:40.850]  It's not a thing.
[33:41.070 --> 33:41.730]  But what would it be?
[33:41.910 --> 33:44.970]  It would be a container because it has a lid.
[33:45.170 --> 33:46.750]  OK, so that's what qualifies it.
[33:46.830 --> 33:47.010]  All right.
[33:47.110 --> 33:50.110]  So, Andrew, I have a question because you're not on Instagram then.
[33:50.310 --> 33:51.190]  No, I'm not. That's correct.
[33:51.570 --> 33:59.410]  Someone has been sending Instagram posts beating your Garfield times.
[33:59.610 --> 34:00.410]  No way.
[34:00.410 --> 34:04.150]  Apparently, and I wish I had it to show it to you because the last one I saw,
[34:04.370 --> 34:07.570]  but I guess it disappears after 24 hours if it's in your story or whatever.
[34:07.950 --> 34:14.870]  It said, I have beaten all of the times, but I left one for Andrew so that he can still have
[34:14.870 --> 34:20.170]  some dignity. But Lasagna Mountain got a lot smaller for him. I own Garfield now.
[34:20.350 --> 34:21.670]  Have you not checked your times lately?
[34:21.870 --> 34:23.790]  Have either of you been in a pyramid scheme?
[34:26.110 --> 34:28.970]  I'm just asking. That's a natural pivot.
[34:28.970 --> 34:32.250]  I definitely have things to say about Garfield.
[34:32.590 --> 34:35.990]  My response to the Garfield thing is good job to that person.
[34:36.330 --> 34:38.790]  It's tough being on top of Lasagna Mountain. If anything, it's a relief.
[34:39.050 --> 34:40.070]  I'm glad I'm no longer there.
[34:40.250 --> 34:45.350]  But I argue that the bullshit of I gave them one time to feel good about themselves.
[34:45.610 --> 34:48.050]  That's the fastest fucking time on the planet.
[34:48.310 --> 34:49.270]  That's why they didn't beat it.
[34:49.450 --> 34:50.410]  Was it a pity move?
[34:50.570 --> 34:53.230]  I feel like you're a little crushed about losing all these Garfield times.
[34:53.410 --> 34:55.570]  Like you were on this for months.
[34:55.650 --> 34:57.090]  Were you aware of it before this moment?
[34:57.250 --> 34:57.870]  Yes, I was.
[34:57.870 --> 35:03.090]  Okay, I didn't figure it'd be possible for you to be ignorant of the fact that
[35:03.090 --> 35:05.310]  so many of your times had been beaten so thoroughly.
[35:05.590 --> 35:07.990]  Were you hoping, Andrew, that we wouldn't find out?
[35:08.110 --> 35:10.870]  And that we wouldn't think you were less impressive than you used to be?
[35:10.990 --> 35:13.650]  No, in all honesty, I learned this yesterday.
[35:13.870 --> 35:16.610]  Because I'm not on Instagram, but somebody mentioned it to me.
[35:16.650 --> 35:18.150]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[35:18.530 --> 35:19.910]  The throne is still fine.
[35:20.290 --> 35:21.610]  And then they showed me the post.
[35:22.030 --> 35:22.730]  Yeah, good for them.
[35:23.130 --> 35:25.710]  It's stressful being at the top. I was there for almost a year.
[35:25.710 --> 35:28.550]  I still have the fastest time anyone has ever seen.
[35:28.850 --> 35:29.670]  Feel good about that.
[35:30.190 --> 35:31.910]  They beat that, then I'm out of the game.
[35:31.970 --> 35:33.050]  And who knows, maybe I'll come back.
[35:33.290 --> 35:34.710]  Maybe I'm just going to hide in the weeds a little bit.
[35:34.770 --> 35:36.330]  I'm going to do a Gavin and Halo move.
[35:36.470 --> 35:37.730]  I'm just going to wait for a while.
[35:38.030 --> 35:39.550]  You're trapping Garfield times.
[35:40.070 --> 35:42.950]  Yeah, well, I'm trying to get into the Xbox Hall of Fame at the moment.
[35:43.030 --> 35:43.670]  So I'm a little occupied.
[35:43.910 --> 35:47.750]  I saw from a tweet that Ray is in the Xbox Hall of Fame somehow.
[35:48.010 --> 35:49.070]  Is it gamer score based?
[35:49.270 --> 35:49.690]  Sort of.
[35:49.810 --> 35:51.410]  It was like a promotion they gave.
[35:51.590 --> 35:55.470]  They just inducted a bunch of people who were notable, I guess, for gamer score.
[35:55.710 --> 35:59.950]  But they're doing this contest where you can enter the Hall of Fame by either
[35:59.950 --> 36:03.110]  unlocking the most achievements by, I think, the middle of October,
[36:03.830 --> 36:09.310]  getting the most points or playing the most Game Pass games within that stretch.
[36:09.430 --> 36:12.510]  And it's account wide and only one winner per country.
[36:12.830 --> 36:16.110]  So I was trying to figure out what country had the smallest population
[36:16.110 --> 36:18.990]  that I could get into and try to claim victory of.
[36:19.130 --> 36:20.730]  North Korea, not an option.
[36:21.910 --> 36:26.030]  My immediate didn't think they'd have a large user base or install base there.
[36:26.310 --> 36:26.650]  I don't know.
[36:26.770 --> 36:27.490]  Sweden, maybe.
[36:27.710 --> 36:29.570]  Sweden, I don't know what the install base is.
[36:29.670 --> 36:30.690]  I need to do more research.
[36:30.930 --> 36:32.910]  But now I bet you've got some competition in Sweden.
[36:33.170 --> 36:33.570]  Probably.
[36:33.830 --> 36:34.570]  Maybe Iceland?
[36:34.890 --> 36:35.270]  I don't know.
[36:35.370 --> 36:36.590]  Yeah, I'll write that down.
[36:36.910 --> 36:38.590]  No, Iceland's too big.
[36:38.690 --> 36:40.990]  I would maybe not that big.
[36:41.050 --> 36:43.730]  But doesn't even need to necessarily be literal population.
[36:43.730 --> 36:44.950]  It's install base.
[36:45.150 --> 36:45.390]  Right.
[36:45.470 --> 36:49.030]  So like Tokyo, a lot of people, not many play Xbox.
[36:49.450 --> 36:50.510]  So that could be a viable option.
[36:50.510 --> 36:55.050]  I bet there's some little like Andalusian mountain country you could pick that's got
[36:55.050 --> 36:56.470]  like 2,500 people.
[36:56.730 --> 36:57.290]  I'll write it down.
[36:57.370 --> 36:58.070]  I'll have to go through.
[36:58.630 --> 37:02.130]  I'm in the research phase right now, just making sure I could even pull this off.
[37:02.210 --> 37:03.810]  I don't think they have a rule against it.
[37:04.130 --> 37:06.850]  That doesn't mean it will be approved that they maybe just didn't anticipate.
[37:07.150 --> 37:09.930]  I'm pretty sure you'd have to have...
[37:09.930 --> 37:11.670]  You can't just change your location, surely.
[37:11.770 --> 37:14.270]  Wouldn't you have to have a billing address there to make sure you're from there?
[37:14.390 --> 37:17.130]  Oh, I flip location on Xbox all the time.
[37:17.130 --> 37:20.730]  Andrew probably has a billing address in every country in the world.
[37:21.670 --> 37:24.370]  He's like the Canadian born identity.
[37:24.770 --> 37:29.850]  He's got a passport and currency and a phone number and an email address.
[37:30.230 --> 37:31.170]  He could disappear tomorrow.
[37:31.310 --> 37:31.450]  Yeah.
[37:31.570 --> 37:32.270]  Where's his money?
[37:32.690 --> 37:35.070]  It's got to be spread across so many countries.
[37:35.210 --> 37:38.410]  I was thinking the other day, Andrew is the person I've known the longest,
[37:38.830 --> 37:41.210]  but in a ratio I know the least about.
[37:41.390 --> 37:45.730]  I know absolutely nothing about your day to day, your living situation.
[37:45.730 --> 37:47.050]  I don't know anything.
[37:47.210 --> 37:49.710]  I know that you sit next to a fire extinguisher once a week.
[37:49.870 --> 37:51.810]  That's about it for like how you live.
[37:52.110 --> 37:52.790]  Still in a blanket fort.
[37:53.030 --> 37:54.550]  Everything else is a mystery to me.
[37:54.770 --> 37:57.570]  I assume you live like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window.
[37:58.210 --> 38:01.810]  You just sit in a chair with a tartan blanket around you next to a fire extinguisher
[38:01.810 --> 38:04.530]  and look out the window hoping to catch homeless women peeing.
[38:04.690 --> 38:08.750]  Do you think, Andrew, a good gift would be a telescope so that you could see the pee closer?
[38:08.890 --> 38:09.190]  No.
[38:09.430 --> 38:10.350]  Yeah, like binoculars.
[38:10.970 --> 38:12.130]  No, I don't do that.
[38:12.330 --> 38:12.710]  I'm good.
[38:12.850 --> 38:14.710]  Dude, Jimmy Stewart was a badass.
[38:14.710 --> 38:17.310]  There are worse people to be compared to.
[38:18.190 --> 38:21.350]  My complaint wasn't with being compared to Jimmy Stewart.
[38:21.850 --> 38:26.530]  My issue was with, once again, the continued narrative that I have an obsession of watching
[38:26.530 --> 38:29.490]  homeless women pee and that I need a telescope for it.
[38:29.590 --> 38:31.870]  I was not arguing the Jimmy Stewart point, Geoff.
[38:32.010 --> 38:33.530]  Oh, you don't need the telescope?
[38:33.830 --> 38:35.310]  I don't. I don't do it.
[38:35.350 --> 38:36.690]  So I don't need a telescope for anything.
[38:36.790 --> 38:38.410]  I'm not really into looking into the sky.
[38:38.630 --> 38:41.110]  I can't believe you're turning down a free telescope here.
[38:41.510 --> 38:42.770]  It's a cool piece of kit.
[38:42.990 --> 38:43.610]  They're expensive.
[38:43.610 --> 38:45.430]  Think of all the fun stuff you could do with them.
[38:45.570 --> 38:47.350]  What would be the fun stuff I could do with them, Geoff?
[38:47.570 --> 38:50.790]  I could probably figure out a way to burn ants from your bedroom.
[38:50.970 --> 38:51.510]  That's cool.
[38:51.730 --> 38:52.350]  Wait, how?
[38:52.530 --> 38:54.350]  I don't know, like with refraction, right?
[38:54.530 --> 38:57.150]  So wait, the telescope is in his apartment.
[38:57.510 --> 38:59.970]  You think the sun is in there with him and he can focus?
[39:00.230 --> 39:01.290]  He's got a window, Gavin.
[39:01.370 --> 39:03.830]  He could hang it out the window, put it on a pole, you know?
[39:04.030 --> 39:05.870]  Attach the pole to a C-clamp.
[39:06.190 --> 39:13.590]  Dude, the guy, he lives in a pillow fort supported by, I assume, sofa cushions and a fire extinguisher.
[39:13.590 --> 39:14.870]  That's just pretty convoluted.
[39:14.930 --> 39:17.790]  He'd be better off throwing a Molotov cocktail out the window if he wanted to burn an ant.
[39:19.790 --> 39:20.970]  This seems very extreme.
[39:21.110 --> 39:23.530]  He's like a little, I mean, he's also, he's like a Bourne identity,
[39:23.690 --> 39:26.150]  but he's also a little bit like a MacGyver if you think about it.
[39:26.670 --> 39:29.210]  Wait, could you use a telescope to do that even?
[39:29.430 --> 39:30.790]  Like, logistically, would that work?
[39:31.030 --> 39:32.150]  That feels very extreme.
[39:32.270 --> 39:32.890]  I don't see why not.
[39:33.070 --> 39:35.950]  It'd be like calling in a hammer at dawn against an ant.
[39:36.390 --> 39:38.990]  Like the amount, like normally it's the magnifying glass.
[39:39.130 --> 39:43.110]  Yeah, I mean, the sun is still much bigger than an ant though, like no matter what you use it between.
[39:43.110 --> 39:47.650]  No, but I feel like it's more powerful with the magnifying or the telescope
[39:47.650 --> 39:49.730]  than it would be the magnifying glass. Am I wrong about that?
[39:49.850 --> 39:53.070]  No, I mean, if it's focused to a point, say of like two millimeters,
[39:53.430 --> 39:55.810]  it doesn't really matter what lens that you do that with.
[39:55.850 --> 39:57.250]  It's just, that's the point.
[39:57.350 --> 39:58.970]  Like that's all the focus in that point.
[39:59.390 --> 40:02.390]  You could do, you could do like nine lenses or one if it's the same,
[40:02.490 --> 40:06.230]  like surface area, surely it's the same power if, unless you're losing,
[40:06.730 --> 40:08.910]  if it's like refracting and losing within the lens.
[40:09.170 --> 40:11.670]  Wait, so the number of lenses wouldn't matter?
[40:11.670 --> 40:14.610]  I mean, I would say you're possibly going to lose more light
[40:14.610 --> 40:16.590]  if it goes through more pieces of glass.
[40:16.710 --> 40:17.290]  That makes sense.
[40:17.570 --> 40:20.350]  I mean, like a photography lens, if it's a long lens,
[40:20.630 --> 40:24.410]  usually has a higher f-stop because of why? Who cares?
[40:27.870 --> 40:32.550]  In my head, it makes more sense that a telescope would be more powerful than a magnifying glass.
[40:32.690 --> 40:34.410]  You might be right. I'm just, I'm just guessing.
[40:34.650 --> 40:39.030]  No, your guess is way more educated than mine. Mine is, it is longer and bigger,
[40:39.030 --> 40:41.810]  so it would be more powerful. So I think your logic probably wins.
[40:41.910 --> 40:43.690]  Can I ask you guys your opinion on something?
[40:43.930 --> 40:44.110]  Yeah.
[40:44.210 --> 40:47.310]  I'm trying to decide if this is a f-face or not, and this isn't me,
[40:47.590 --> 40:51.530]  but a couple of weeks ago, I was driving around Austin, bored,
[40:51.890 --> 40:55.110]  and a friend of mine who lives in South Austin had been telling me
[40:55.110 --> 40:57.990]  about this area that she lives by called Onion Creek.
[40:58.270 --> 41:01.250]  And Onion Creek was like a country club and a golf course
[41:01.250 --> 41:03.630]  and just like a little part of town in Southeast Austin,
[41:03.710 --> 41:05.370]  which by the way, like we used to go,
[41:05.790 --> 41:08.530]  that tech company that I worked at with Bernie and Gus,
[41:08.530 --> 41:09.510]  we started Rooster Teeth from.
[41:09.810 --> 41:12.450]  Like that was where they had, at their country club was where they had
[41:12.450 --> 41:14.090]  like the shitty Christmas dinner every year.
[41:14.350 --> 41:20.450]  And like around like 2013, that area flooded really, really badly.
[41:20.570 --> 41:22.850]  There's this area in Austin called the Hundred Year Flood Plain,
[41:23.010 --> 41:24.530]  and like supposedly once every hundred years,
[41:24.690 --> 41:26.070]  it just floods like a motherfucker,
[41:26.450 --> 41:29.050]  and it's hard to get insurance if you live in the flood plain.
[41:29.490 --> 41:30.070]  Yada, yada, yada.
[41:30.270 --> 41:33.550]  So I guess it was so bad with, you know, climate change,
[41:33.570 --> 41:36.310]  or if you don't believe in climate change, bad luck or whatever,
[41:36.790 --> 41:39.150]  it was determined that this is going to continue to happen.
[41:39.330 --> 41:42.650]  And so there are all these neighborhoods that were in Onion Creek
[41:42.650 --> 41:44.770]  that were just in such danger of flooding.
[41:45.210 --> 41:51.050]  The city in 2018 did a buyback program and they bought back about 500 houses.
[41:51.690 --> 41:55.890]  So imagine two neighborhoods that are essentially 500 house neighborhoods.
[41:56.050 --> 41:57.010]  So they're pretty big.
[41:57.090 --> 41:59.050]  I think one was about 400 and the other one's about 100.
[41:59.490 --> 42:03.290]  So the city bought all these houses and I assume they paid fair price.
[42:03.290 --> 42:07.530]  It was like a joint venture between the state of Texas or the city of Austin
[42:07.530 --> 42:09.070]  and the Army Corps of Engineers.
[42:09.370 --> 42:11.830]  And so I think they went and they offered fair market value to these people
[42:11.830 --> 42:13.190]  and then people sold their homes.
[42:13.330 --> 42:16.890]  Then they bulldozed all the homes, all the 500 homes,
[42:17.290 --> 42:23.270]  and took out the power lines and took out any trees that they thought,
[42:23.550 --> 42:26.790]  like ornamental trees that would become a danger to fall over
[42:26.790 --> 42:27.970]  if they weren't cared for, you know,
[42:28.030 --> 42:31.710]  like trees that aren't native to Texas that would be in your backyard,
[42:31.710 --> 42:33.510]  you know, you planted like a crepe myrtle or something.
[42:33.750 --> 42:35.390]  She was telling me about it. She was like, you should check it out.
[42:35.450 --> 42:36.670]  It's like post-apocalyptic.
[42:37.170 --> 42:40.530]  And so I drove over there and I've become obsessed with it, right?
[42:40.890 --> 42:47.130]  Because it's neighborhoods with sidewalks and streets and in some cases,
[42:47.490 --> 42:51.990]  like a trash can, like at the street and sometimes an old mailbox.
[42:52.470 --> 42:55.930]  And sometimes you see like a power generator where somebody's house used to be.
[42:56.110 --> 43:00.250]  But out of the 500 houses, 10 of them refused to sell.
[43:00.250 --> 43:02.570]  And so they're still there.
[43:02.750 --> 43:03.550]  With people living in them?
[43:03.650 --> 43:06.930]  Yeah. And it's fucking crazy because do you remember that movie?
[43:07.030 --> 43:09.570]  It was a book, but do you remember the movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman?
[43:09.650 --> 43:10.530]  That was like a couple of years ago?
[43:10.790 --> 43:11.710]  Yes. Yeah, it was weird.
[43:11.950 --> 43:13.410]  Yeah. The neighborhood looks like that.
[43:13.490 --> 43:14.930]  It's like it was 2018.
[43:15.150 --> 43:17.250]  They started the buyback program and they bulldozed all the houses.
[43:17.810 --> 43:22.170]  So it's all overgrown and kind of like East Texas swampy looking,
[43:22.310 --> 43:23.350]  but it's fucking gorgeous.
[43:23.730 --> 43:25.650]  So it looks like post-apocalyptic, right?
[43:25.670 --> 43:29.370]  It looks like the nature took over the neighborhood back.
[43:29.370 --> 43:32.850]  So do they like send people to collect the bins and stuff still or is that just...
[43:32.850 --> 43:38.430]  Yeah. So they cut power and they cut power lines everywhere but to these 10 houses.
[43:38.670 --> 43:40.690]  So the houses still have city water.
[43:41.190 --> 43:42.130]  They still have gas.
[43:42.210 --> 43:43.670]  They still have electricity forever.
[43:44.050 --> 43:46.530]  The city didn't force the people to sell the houses.
[43:47.050 --> 43:49.650]  They just encouraged it and it became a good deal because of,
[43:50.230 --> 43:51.450]  you know, they were going to fucking flood.
[43:51.670 --> 43:55.550]  So you would think like the people that refuse to sell totally f*** face themselves, right?
[43:55.550 --> 44:00.490]  But they kind of didn't because those houses have been there since like the 50s.
[44:00.550 --> 44:02.910]  And I think this place has flooded that badly once.
[44:03.110 --> 44:04.950]  In their lifetimes, I got to thinking about it.
[44:05.030 --> 44:06.910]  It probably won't flood that badly again.
[44:07.050 --> 44:08.470]  Maybe it will, I don't know.
[44:08.590 --> 44:13.150]  But they have an entire 500 house neighborhood to themselves.
[44:13.570 --> 44:14.110]  That's crazy.
[44:14.230 --> 44:17.010]  I bet there's like barely any busyness noise.
[44:17.450 --> 44:20.270]  I bet they never have to put up with like the leaf blower next door.
[44:20.630 --> 44:22.490]  They bet their systems are never taxed.
[44:22.490 --> 44:27.010]  I bet that internet is racing fast because it's not split across hundreds of houses.
[44:27.450 --> 44:28.730]  It's so weird.
[44:28.870 --> 44:30.810]  And I've been kind of obsessed with the idea.
[44:31.050 --> 44:32.690]  Like I couldn't go buy a house there.
[44:32.830 --> 44:35.570]  But I guarantee you if I drove you guys over there right now,
[44:35.810 --> 44:37.350]  you'd go, this is a beautiful neighborhood.
[44:37.710 --> 44:39.050]  This, you should build some houses here.
[44:39.110 --> 44:39.630]  This is awesome.
[44:39.950 --> 44:44.590]  But they essentially, like the city has turned it into in perpetuity parkland.
[44:44.770 --> 44:49.050]  And so they've designated it like a city park or whatever.
[44:50.010 --> 44:52.370]  They've put some bike paths and stuff through it.
[44:52.550 --> 44:56.670]  But it's just like this crazy weird area where you're driving through neighborhoods.
[44:56.890 --> 45:00.130]  And you can see like a palm tree that used to be in somebody's backyard,
[45:00.590 --> 45:01.930]  like 20 feet in the air.
[45:02.290 --> 45:05.470]  That's like unkempt and just like super doesn't belong there.
[45:05.610 --> 45:08.950]  And you can see where driveways used to be and what's left of it.
[45:09.030 --> 45:13.990]  In two years, just two years, the sidewalks are almost gone from like stuff going over it.
[45:13.990 --> 45:19.570]  And there's just these like 10 people that just live where 500 houses used to be.
[45:19.870 --> 45:21.270]  And they're the only homes.
[45:21.370 --> 45:22.150]  It's crazy.
[45:22.330 --> 45:23.350]  I don't think that's a f*** face.
[45:23.450 --> 45:27.270]  I think those holdouts will now be much more valuable than they ever would have been before.
[45:27.430 --> 45:29.510]  Because people might want that lifestyle.
[45:29.750 --> 45:32.210]  If I bet you couldn't convince them to sell for anything cheap.
[45:32.330 --> 45:34.370]  Like, I don't know what the laws are behind it.
[45:34.390 --> 45:35.610]  I don't know if they can sell.
[45:35.810 --> 45:38.090]  Like, I don't know if you can buy that property or if you sell,
[45:38.170 --> 45:39.350]  you have to sell to the city or something.
[45:39.550 --> 45:40.070]  I don't know.
[45:40.270 --> 45:40.610]  Really?
[45:40.790 --> 45:41.670]  I really don't know, dude.
[45:41.730 --> 45:42.170]  I don't know.
[45:42.170 --> 45:45.670]  All I know is that the city still supplies services to those people.
[45:45.850 --> 45:47.290]  And they have...
[45:47.290 --> 45:52.450]  Like, imagine in your neighborhood, Gavin, if every house you could see got bulldozed.
[45:52.690 --> 45:53.650]  But your house was fine.
[45:54.330 --> 45:57.290]  And then all the debris and everything was moved away.
[45:57.410 --> 46:00.650]  And then the city came in and they cut that grass twice a year.
[46:00.770 --> 46:02.090]  I read the city's plan on it.
[46:02.290 --> 46:04.470]  They cut the vegetation down twice a year.
[46:04.770 --> 46:08.650]  So it's essentially, it's just like left to turn into fields and forests.
[46:08.650 --> 46:12.330]  I'm imagining what happens in Fallout 4 in Sanctuary.
[46:12.450 --> 46:15.450]  If you just like scrap all the other houses apart from your own.
[46:16.750 --> 46:18.530]  That'd be awesome. I'd be all for that.
[46:18.650 --> 46:19.590]  Yeah, it's insane.
[46:19.930 --> 46:23.870]  So it's like, the gamble is your house could be flooded at any point though, right?
[46:23.990 --> 46:26.770]  Yeah, at any point, like irrevocably flooded.
[46:26.890 --> 46:28.710]  Could you lift it up and put on stilts?
[46:28.850 --> 46:29.730]  That's a great question.
[46:29.850 --> 46:30.470]  I don't know.
[46:30.550 --> 46:35.350]  Or do you build your own, like, little fucking moats and shit in your yard?
[46:35.490 --> 46:36.530]  Or build retaining walls?
[46:36.530 --> 46:38.850]  They just look like they're just going about their business.
[46:39.110 --> 46:42.270]  Like, the houses look like they were in a neighborhood with another 400 houses.
[46:42.450 --> 46:43.630]  Like, they don't look like anything special.
[46:43.750 --> 46:44.490]  They don't look fortified.
[46:44.650 --> 46:45.350]  They don't look great.
[46:45.630 --> 46:46.990]  They're not the nicest houses you've ever seen.
[46:47.090 --> 46:50.070]  Are you allowed to buy a crane and live in a house that's hanging off it?
[46:50.150 --> 46:50.490]  No.
[46:50.690 --> 46:50.950]  Why not?
[46:51.210 --> 46:51.470]  Why not?
[46:51.530 --> 46:54.910]  I don't, I don't know why, but no, the answer is no, you can't do that.
[46:54.930 --> 46:58.350]  And then when it floods, your crane gets wet, but you're still good.
[46:59.010 --> 47:01.990]  The crane starts going down, your house is just moving.
[47:02.330 --> 47:03.710]  You end up in a different neighborhood.
[47:03.710 --> 47:06.870]  It lands, like, a block over because the crane tipped.
[47:07.790 --> 47:08.470]  That'd be awesome.
[47:08.630 --> 47:11.930]  If you're in Austin and you know anybody that lives in Onion Creek,
[47:12.030 --> 47:15.610]  Gavin, we used to have a friend who lived in Onion Creek years and years and years ago.
[47:15.690 --> 47:17.650]  I never went to his house when he lived there.
[47:17.970 --> 47:20.710]  But, uh, I don't know if they were in the part that, like,
[47:20.710 --> 47:23.690]  if they had to have their houses bought back or not, but it's just fucking...
[47:23.690 --> 47:26.210]  I haven't been able to stop thinking about this house and whether or not
[47:26.210 --> 47:28.710]  these people fucked themselves or whether they were brilliant.
[47:29.010 --> 47:33.290]  Now, the buyback program is over, so they can't sell the house to the city now.
[47:33.290 --> 47:36.910]  City's like, nah, fuck you. That ship's sailing, you know?
[47:37.190 --> 47:40.990]  So if you lose that bet and that place gets flooded, I think you're fucked.
[47:41.230 --> 47:45.110]  But, um, so I guess it's like as long as Mother Nature plays ball, you're good.
[47:45.350 --> 47:50.730]  But man, what a cool idea to live, like, essentially by yourself in a suburban neighborhood.
[47:51.110 --> 47:53.690]  The people that remained, how... are they spread out throughout?
[47:53.810 --> 47:57.890]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I read in an article that there were 10 surviving houses.
[47:58.010 --> 47:58.990]  I only saw six.
[47:59.170 --> 48:01.810]  I think there's areas I still haven't seen because it's kind of confusing.
[48:02.230 --> 48:05.330]  But I would say they're, um, blocks away from each other.
[48:05.490 --> 48:08.590]  I would be irate if I had a neighbor in that situation.
[48:09.010 --> 48:11.490]  Because the only house with a neighbor, that'd be infuriating.
[48:11.650 --> 48:12.190]  No, absolutely.
[48:12.450 --> 48:14.030]  Can you navigate via the roads pretty well?
[48:14.130 --> 48:14.870]  Roads are totally fine.
[48:15.030 --> 48:16.030]  I think I'd take that gamble.
[48:16.370 --> 48:19.130]  It's not a fuckface until it happens, and it might never happen.
[48:19.290 --> 48:19.610]  Right.
[48:19.790 --> 48:20.770]  I think they're winning right now.
[48:20.890 --> 48:21.450]  Let's go there.
[48:21.590 --> 48:23.230]  Yeah, I'll take you. I'll take you sometime. We'll go.
[48:23.350 --> 48:26.290]  As soon as we can go places in a car together, I'll fucking drive you over there.
[48:26.410 --> 48:29.690]  It seems like somebody should have filmed a movie there by now.
[48:29.690 --> 48:31.690]  I'll watch you two from my telescope.
[48:32.390 --> 48:34.990]  I've just noticed it's 4.55, right?
[48:35.270 --> 48:37.410]  I have to do another show at 5.
[48:37.590 --> 48:42.790]  So if we start the outro process five minutes from when I need to be gone, we should be done in time.
[48:42.950 --> 48:44.890]  Do you think we'll find a new color in our lifetime?
[48:45.110 --> 48:46.270]  Okay, well...
[48:46.270 --> 48:47.350]  What does that mean?
[48:47.470 --> 48:48.410]  That's not the right direction.
[48:48.570 --> 48:49.690]  Like invent a color?
[48:50.010 --> 48:52.470]  Yeah, I mean, do you think we'll find a new color?
[48:52.630 --> 48:54.230]  What, like the color blemph?
[48:54.450 --> 48:57.510]  Oh, it'd just kind of cool if a magazine was like, hey, we found a new purple.
[48:57.510 --> 48:59.770]  That would be purple. It'd be like a shade of purple.
[48:59.910 --> 49:02.490]  Well, that's a new color though. Shade is certainly a new color, isn't it?
[49:02.610 --> 49:05.910]  Well, I mean, sure. I mean, we surely have every visible...
[49:05.910 --> 49:09.330]  or every color that's on our, you know, visible spectrum we've nailed.
[49:10.630 --> 49:16.050]  Are you talking like maybe we'll find something beyond ultraviolet that for some reason we can see?
[49:16.270 --> 49:18.770]  I don't know how colors work. I'm just wondering if we'll find a new one.
[49:18.830 --> 49:19.430]  What would you name it?
[49:19.510 --> 49:23.050]  I have no idea. I'm not the Crayola company. They come up with that, right?
[49:23.050 --> 49:27.410]  Yes, Crayola names. They're the official naming entity of colors.
[49:27.630 --> 49:31.310]  I mean, who names colors? Is someone credited with naming a color?
[49:32.830 --> 49:33.790]  I don't know.
[49:33.950 --> 49:37.650]  I think they all came from different languages based on different super old school shit.
[49:37.810 --> 49:39.230]  Maybe Latin or something.
[49:39.370 --> 49:42.650]  But surely someone had to come up with it, right? Someone had to be like, that's red.
[49:43.190 --> 49:43.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:44.090 --> 49:47.510]  I feel like you guys are acting like this is an insane question. I think it's very reasonable.
[49:47.570 --> 49:50.770]  It's not an insane question. It's just, it's like, it's something I thought about when I was eight,
[49:50.970 --> 49:51.250]  you know?
[49:52.430 --> 49:55.970]  You still don't have an answer. You've been, I just thought about this last week.
[49:56.710 --> 50:00.510]  How old are you now, Gavin? 20 years, no results? Looks bad on you.
[50:02.310 --> 50:04.710]  But you don't, you don't even have anything ready to go. Like where,
[50:04.810 --> 50:06.370]  where could the color possibly be?
[50:06.570 --> 50:09.910]  I will know. I'm not, I don't think I'm going to discover a new color.
[50:10.050 --> 50:14.890]  Are you thinking that there's some combination of paint colors you could put together
[50:14.890 --> 50:16.690]  that nobody's thought of yet?
[50:16.750 --> 50:20.870]  You put a little red in there, a little green, maybe a little brown, put some orange.
[50:21.590 --> 50:27.230]  Shake it a little bit. I don't know. I was asking. I was just asking a question.
[50:27.470 --> 50:31.050]  I'm going to say no. Let me ask you this. Do you believe in Mandela effects?
[50:31.490 --> 50:35.810]  Because I really want to, but now I'm convinced after I spent a lot of time on the subreddit
[50:35.810 --> 50:41.610]  that 99% of Mandela effects, people just don't understand that movies are edited for TV.
[50:41.950 --> 50:45.110]  That's a great point. I actually never thought about that angle. Some of them though,
[50:45.130 --> 50:48.390]  aren't aren't movie related. It's like names, right? And spelling of words.
[50:48.390 --> 50:52.470]  Sometimes, but mostly it's just people don't understand that movies are edited down for TV.
[50:52.830 --> 50:54.190]  Like that color that just went missing.
[50:54.330 --> 50:57.890]  Yeah. Or that sometimes they put something in a trailer that doesn't make it into the film.
[50:58.090 --> 51:02.830]  Like the scene in Dumb and Dumber in the trailer when Lloyd Christmas is running down the jetway
[51:02.830 --> 51:07.410]  and then they back the plane up and he falls and he's like laying funny on the ground,
[51:07.650 --> 51:09.930]  holding the briefcase. I don't think that's in the movie, but it's in the trailer.
[51:10.070 --> 51:10.730]  It is in the movie.
[51:10.910 --> 51:11.430]  Is it in the movie?
[51:11.550 --> 51:15.010]  Of course it is. It's like the best part of the movie. Aside from the snowball in the face,
[51:15.090 --> 51:15.950]  that's the best part.
[51:15.950 --> 51:20.770]  Then there's something in that scene that's in the trailer that's not in the movie.
[51:20.950 --> 51:24.090]  Did Geoff just fall for his own trap that he was complaining about?
[51:24.250 --> 51:27.130]  I mean, he also thought chickens shat through their head skin, so.
[51:27.270 --> 51:27.830]  That's true.
[51:27.970 --> 51:29.190]  Hey, we should probably stop though.
[51:29.310 --> 51:29.550]  Yeah!
[51:29.870 --> 51:31.690]  Before I look any dumber or Gavin's late.
[51:31.950 --> 51:32.730]  Thanks for listening.
[51:32.990 --> 51:35.530]  What about like pillow? It's like a purple and a yellow.
[51:38.070 --> 51:42.950]  All right. Thanks for listening. Rate five stars and subscribe, whatever that means.
[51:42.950 --> 51:46.690]  This has been episode 16 of F*** Face. Thank you for listening.
[51:47.090 --> 51:50.870]  And Nick, go ahead and cut out anything where I look dumb or not super smart.
[51:51.270 --> 51:53.650]  Cut out the whole Mandela effect thing, because I look dumb in it.
[51:53.650 --> 51:56.790]  Or at least the part where I talk about Dumb and Dumber, which I'm misremembering.
[51:56.850 --> 51:59.710]  There's something in the trailer of Dumb and Dumber that's not in the film.
[51:59.850 --> 52:01.990]  There's something in the trailer of Liar Liar that's not in the film.
[52:02.210 --> 52:04.110]  Also involving plane stairs.
[52:04.910 --> 52:06.630]  Maybe that's what I'm misremembering.
[52:06.710 --> 52:07.990]  You ever see the Slender Man movie?
[52:08.250 --> 52:09.490]  No, I heard it was bad.
[52:09.630 --> 52:12.790]  There's a lot of stuff in the trailer that's just not in the movie.
[52:12.790 --> 52:15.590]  Nick and Eric haven't figured out that they need to drag us out
[52:15.590 --> 52:17.810]  and not move themselves into end show.
[52:18.070 --> 52:19.470]  Gavin, you're about to officially be late.
[52:19.650 --> 52:21.730]  Well, now we're just all in here. That doesn't work.
[52:22.090 --> 52:24.590]  Then the show's over. Goodbye. I have to go to a meeting. Goodbye.
[52:26.270 --> 52:27.010]  Oh, he left.
