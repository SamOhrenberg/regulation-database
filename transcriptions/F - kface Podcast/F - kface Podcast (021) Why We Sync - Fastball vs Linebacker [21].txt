[00:00.000 --> 00:03.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.660 --> 00:10.860]  This is number 21, our 146th, 47th episode or so, 200.
[00:11.240 --> 00:16.720]  And my name is Geoff and this is also I got Eric and Gavin and Nick and Andrew.
[00:16.940 --> 00:17.880]  Let's talk to Andrew real fast.
[00:17.940 --> 00:19.800]  So straight away, we should point out.
[00:19.840 --> 00:21.480]  This is the second recording.
[00:21.660 --> 00:23.740]  We stopped recording about a minute ago.
[00:23.940 --> 00:24.780]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:24.920 --> 00:26.900]  We stopped recording about a minute ago.
[00:27.060 --> 00:29.200]  Andrew stopped recording about two minutes ago,
[00:29.200 --> 00:32.300]  then started recording again two seconds later.
[00:32.460 --> 00:35.040]  So, Andrew, without anyone explaining it to you,
[00:35.160 --> 00:38.020]  why do you think we do a sync?
[00:38.440 --> 00:41.780]  We sync because he's going to lay down all of the tracks
[00:42.240 --> 00:43.960]  and then play them simultaneously.
[00:44.460 --> 00:50.040]  And having us all count, he'll be able to figure out, like, the timing of it to get us all aligned.
[00:50.380 --> 00:51.040]  Let me ask you this.
[00:51.660 --> 00:58.280]  What is Nick going to do with a 20-second chunk at the end of your file that's just a sync?
[00:58.280 --> 01:01.380]  Well, it's the same file.
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.120]  There's just a little detour.
[01:04.020 --> 01:05.800]  So it's not even a new track.
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.280]  It's on your existing track.
[01:07.580 --> 01:08.640]  It's on my existing track.
[01:08.720 --> 01:11.160]  So what does that mean for your sync?
[01:12.660 --> 01:14.680]  Well, at the end, we're all counting again.
[01:15.280 --> 01:18.080]  No, at the end, all four of us are counting again.
[01:18.420 --> 01:20.400]  You're counting before we start counting.
[01:20.660 --> 01:23.220]  If you stopped and started, your sync happened sooner.
[01:23.880 --> 01:24.580]  Okay, wait a second.
[01:24.780 --> 01:27.120]  Let me figure this out for a second.
[01:27.670 --> 01:28.540]  I think I'm getting along.
[01:28.660 --> 01:30.520]  So if Nick were to sync...
[01:32.300 --> 01:34.440]  Geoff, Geoff, let me get there.
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.720]  I gotta get there myself or this is gonna be pointless.
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.360]  So you do the back sync to see if we have gotten out of sync, I'm assuming, by the end?
[01:45.060 --> 01:45.200]  Yeah.
[01:45.660 --> 01:45.940]  Okay.
[01:46.060 --> 01:47.320]  Yeah, in case it's like someone's drifting.
[01:47.940 --> 01:48.420]  We got it.
[01:48.540 --> 01:51.220]  Okay, well then, yeah, then what I did would be completely useless.
[01:51.400 --> 01:52.280]  I just panicked.
[01:53.500 --> 01:55.720]  We don't typically...
[01:55.720 --> 01:57.640]  Technically, it could be more than useless.
[01:57.920 --> 01:59.480]  It could be super counterproductive.
[01:59.500 --> 02:04.000]  It would be absolutely detrimental to the recording, but I did not expect Andrew going,
[02:04.140 --> 02:04.800]  Ah, yes.
[02:05.500 --> 02:06.740]  That was an immediate fault.
[02:07.140 --> 02:09.500]  But it is worse than not doing a sync.
[02:09.780 --> 02:10.700]  I just want to point that out.
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.640]  Well, now I know that.
[02:11.780 --> 02:12.660]  I didn't know that before.
[02:13.020 --> 02:16.600]  We just recently got into syncing on audio in that way.
[02:16.680 --> 02:19.480]  We have gone 200 something episodes.
[02:19.620 --> 02:20.660]  No, no, no, no, hang on.
[02:20.900 --> 02:21.520]  He's right.
[02:22.040 --> 02:24.080]  Right, we started syncing for the podcast.
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.020]  I'm asking about a sync in general, which we've been doing for a very long time for our video game videos.
[02:29.680 --> 02:30.920]  Yeah, but not not the podcast.
[02:31.060 --> 02:32.040]  Do you think that's different?
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.060]  No, it's just like in my head.
[02:34.180 --> 02:34.780]  It is different.
[02:34.780 --> 02:35.960]  Like we're doing a podcast.
[02:36.060 --> 02:36.980]  We're not doing a let's play.
[02:37.200 --> 02:38.840]  I've worked in my head and let's play.
[02:38.940 --> 02:40.720]  There will be a front sync and an end sync.
[02:40.920 --> 02:43.960]  And this is what the ritual is as opposed to a podcast.
[02:44.320 --> 02:46.300]  My ritual is different, right?
[02:46.320 --> 02:50.960]  I'm not I'm not faulting you for stopping at the end.
[02:51.180 --> 02:52.340]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:52.340 --> 02:57.660]  You just called it a ritual to do a front sync and a back sync in the gameplay.
[02:57.760 --> 03:00.380]  You understand what I'm saying is you understand there's a reason.
[03:01.100 --> 03:01.800]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:02.140 --> 03:03.120]  Like it's the same.
[03:03.240 --> 03:05.000]  It's the exact same purpose.
[03:05.140 --> 03:07.020]  I'm just saying that like I have a habit.
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.760]  I've established in my head of like I'm doing a let's play.
[03:09.820 --> 03:10.860]  It's going to begin this way.
[03:10.900 --> 03:13.800]  It's going to end this way and that's how it's going to go every time.
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.280]  And the podcast we've done like 200 of them where that was not a thing we did at the end.
[03:19.620 --> 03:21.380]  It is a relatively recent thing.
[03:21.380 --> 03:26.120]  Again, I don't think I don't think anybody's faulting you for not doing the tail sync.
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.060]  It is the understanding of why we sync is was that that's what I was curious about.
[03:31.180 --> 03:34.780]  I think it was more just funny the way you addressed it when you said,
[03:34.940 --> 03:37.300]  Oh, I stopped recording. No worries. I hit recording again.
[03:37.420 --> 03:39.380]  Don't worry about it.
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.620]  Problem solved.
[03:40.880 --> 03:43.540]  That was it was just your your sure.
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.400]  Yes, how sure you were that you had remedied the situation,
[03:47.580 --> 03:49.640]  which was so caught us off guard.
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.980]  Yeah, it was like if I knocked a vase over or something of glass
[03:54.980 --> 03:58.320]  and then quickly grabbed all the pieces and said, don't worry.
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.300]  I got them all like it's yeah, it's not the situation is not resolved.
[04:03.540 --> 04:08.860]  It was just more I realized I had made my mistake because I'm so like instinctually.
[04:08.920 --> 04:11.680]  It's like, okay, we're done. I hit stop as soon as the show is over
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.180]  and I need to not do that and I did that and went.
[04:16.320 --> 04:17.760]  Oh, no, I fucked up.
[04:18.220 --> 04:21.560]  I'm going to hit the record button again to try to reverse this.
[04:21.860 --> 04:23.740]  But now I know it's just gone.
[04:23.900 --> 04:26.340]  I would say it was more equivalent to you knocking over a vase
[04:26.340 --> 04:28.600]  and then quickly throwing a different vase at it.
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.360]  Try putting them both together, idiot.
[04:35.800 --> 04:38.520]  To your to your point, though, Andrew, I have the same problem
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.520]  where I'm a creature of habit as well and I almost hit stop recording
[04:43.520 --> 04:45.620]  almost every time we have to do a tail sync for the podcast.
[04:45.720 --> 04:46.540]  I'm not used to it either.
[04:46.540 --> 04:49.740]  We haven't explained how we actually sync, but I don't know if people know,
[04:49.820 --> 04:52.920]  but we usually we have everyone mute except for one person
[04:52.920 --> 04:56.660]  and they count backwards from five and when you kind of we all join in at three.
[04:56.960 --> 04:59.040]  So we all end up saying three, two, one at the same time.
[04:59.260 --> 05:03.360]  Except usually I would say like eight out of every ten times when we all unmute.
[05:03.420 --> 05:05.520]  Somebody goes, I'm sorry. I came back in at one.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.260]  It also works super well for the four of us that are in Texas.
[05:10.260 --> 05:14.060]  But with Andrew, we're dealing with the speed of light.
[05:14.060 --> 05:18.400]  Yeah, there's there's also there's also a thing that has occurred
[05:18.400 --> 05:26.840]  where the countdown kind of goes like five, four, three, two, one,
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.740]  and that will sort of throw everything into chaos.
[05:29.900 --> 05:35.360]  I am I have real performance anxiety for the count and I fuck it up.
[05:35.480 --> 05:39.300]  I feel like every time I have to do the count like I get it in my head about it.
[05:39.340 --> 05:42.960]  I can't keep a cadence. I'm definitely guilty of making that problem.
[05:42.960 --> 05:46.660]  It is the problem for me of when someone else is doing the count of OK,
[05:46.720 --> 05:50.260]  we're going to do the count and then my brain will wander immediately
[05:50.860 --> 05:55.380]  because I'm muted and it's like I shut off and then I'll wake up
[05:55.380 --> 05:57.820]  unless I constantly yell in my own head.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.360]  You got to focus on the count, focus on the count, focus on the count.
[06:00.740 --> 06:06.080]  Otherwise, I will drift instantly to something else and then panic on like two.
[06:06.520 --> 06:11.100]  It is a problem. Maybe what we should do is we'll have Eric stream
[06:11.100 --> 06:13.620]  some Formula One starting lights.
[06:18.180 --> 06:22.760]  I think I think what we have to do is just put like,
[06:23.300 --> 06:26.460]  I think we just have to get like one of those coin dash runner games.
[06:26.600 --> 06:30.680]  So Andrew can like pay attention to something while we all mute everything.
[06:30.940 --> 06:36.780]  Like it's a TikTok. Like Andrew, if I just throw if if that's on the screen where it's running.
[06:37.100 --> 06:39.900]  Oh no, I'm never going to hit that count.
[06:39.900 --> 06:41.600]  I'm going to be all in on those coins.
[06:41.960 --> 06:44.940]  I thought maybe you would keep your focus just enough.
[06:45.280 --> 06:47.000]  But okay, that's good though. What is that Temple Run?
[06:47.340 --> 06:48.820]  I played the shit out of that game. Yeah, there you go.
[06:50.580 --> 06:57.120]  I had that exact same thing happen recently in a different way of like I get distracted
[06:57.780 --> 07:01.640]  and oh man, it was dumb. I was playing.
[07:03.040 --> 07:08.140]  It's one of the dumbest moments I've had in a while. I was playing this app.
[07:08.540 --> 07:13.260]  It's like a guess the jingle game with my partner and it like plays a jingle thing
[07:13.260 --> 07:16.180]  and it was a voice going ho ho ho.
[07:16.840 --> 07:19.320]  And we're like, what the fuck is that? Like what?
[07:19.540 --> 07:23.040]  What Santa branded thing is this?
[07:23.120 --> 07:25.880]  And in the game, you can get like coins every time you beat a level.
[07:25.960 --> 07:31.780]  You get some coins and you can spend the coins to see the brand logo of the thing that you're hearing.
[07:31.880 --> 07:34.940]  So I did that and it was the Jolly Green Giant, which I didn't know.
[07:34.940 --> 07:37.120]  He went ho ho ho. I had no idea.
[07:37.200 --> 07:39.300]  Ho ho ho Green Giant. What he says.
[07:39.620 --> 07:43.000]  I didn't know that. So I thought I need to find an ad.
[07:43.120 --> 07:45.780]  Like I need to see this. What's the context of this ad?
[07:46.020 --> 07:49.220]  So I open up YouTube. I type in Jolly Green Giant ad
[07:49.220 --> 07:52.960]  and I sort through and I find like a more recent one.
[07:53.240 --> 07:56.500]  I hit play and then, you know, only like open a video on YouTube on the bottom.
[07:56.760 --> 07:59.820]  Comments like pop up for it. It was like comments
[07:59.820 --> 08:04.560]  and it said who else is here because of and it was like some YouTuber or whatever.
[08:05.260 --> 08:09.700]  And I looked at that and I said, what the like, who the fuck is that is where my brain went.
[08:10.400 --> 08:18.740]  And then it went to an ad and I I hit skip ad and then the ad for the ad for the Jolly Green Giant thing started
[08:18.740 --> 08:23.940]  and I forgot what I was doing and I said, what the fuck is this?
[08:24.060 --> 08:29.340]  I said, I hit skip ad. You can't take me to another ad when I hit skip ad.
[08:29.340 --> 08:33.280]  I was outraged in my head and the matter of these three seconds,
[08:33.380 --> 08:36.000]  I was convinced that YouTube had changed their entire system
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.740]  and now skip ad meant skip that ad and not go to the content.
[08:40.360 --> 08:44.880]  And then my partner said, that's the ad you you search for. We're watching what you want.
[08:47.800 --> 08:52.660]  I was so angry. Dude. Wow. You're a creature of habit.
[08:52.700 --> 08:56.620]  I love it. I just I was gone. I was lost in the thing.
[08:56.620 --> 09:00.380]  I've never been so upset and then realized I was so wrong so quickly.
[09:01.120 --> 09:06.600]  Irate. I was so mad about that fucking Jolly Green Giant ad. Pay no attention to me in the chat.
[09:06.700 --> 09:10.480]  I'm just putting images of Jolly Green Giants. You're so excited about these two.
[09:10.580 --> 09:13.860]  I feel like you found this one and you went, oh, we got this baby.
[09:14.360 --> 09:22.220]  I'm just looking for making thumbnails. You just dropped one in this coolest homemade costumes dot com.
[09:23.860 --> 09:26.540]  That is not the coolest homemade costume.
[09:27.220 --> 09:31.840]  Have you seen all the different variations through time of the Jolly Green Giant?
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.180]  Have you ever looked at that? I was looking for the one that was like the dude.
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.100]  Let me green. Let me post it and we can go through and talk about the years of the giant.
[09:42.040 --> 09:45.220]  There are some evolutions that I've certainly have never seen before.
[09:45.440 --> 09:49.640]  He didn't used to be green. What? He started out as just a normal giant.
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.840]  He just ate too many peas. He really liked peas in 1928.
[09:55.560 --> 10:03.560]  Then in 1930, he ate too many peas and he turned green. He was the exact same dude, just fully green, including his clothes.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.780]  I wonder if they just sent the first picture, the 1928 version, to like a different company to update it,
[10:08.800 --> 10:11.880]  but it came through as black and white and they just thought he was all green.
[10:12.220 --> 10:16.500]  Or maybe they were like, we're paying too much money screen printing all these extra colors.
[10:16.500 --> 10:19.520]  Let's just make it green. The peas are green. It's fucking one color.
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.860]  Then they completely redesigned him into sort of what you know today in 1936.
[10:25.980 --> 10:29.140]  But he was all about corn then. I guess it was a big year for corn.
[10:29.760 --> 10:38.340]  Then he goes in 1945, he gets married and has corn and peas. He's way bigger.
[10:38.940 --> 10:43.520]  That's bizarre. It's probably how Shaq feels. Yeah, exactly.
[10:45.500 --> 10:55.000]  100%. I like that in 1980, he got cold. He did. I like that in 1948, clearly his marriage went to shit and he just had a weird phase.
[10:55.140 --> 11:00.460]  He was just trying to find himself again. Yeah, he's like a bluey gray. This is midlife crisis.
[11:00.880 --> 11:08.840]  Yeah, 1950 peas. Then 1960, I think they tried to like get fun with it and he looks like a cartoon character.
[11:08.840 --> 11:16.980]  He looks like he belongs on the Flintstones. 1970s, he looks like he's in an animated show that will teach you how to do math.
[11:17.420 --> 11:22.240]  Like it's very like kid-centric. He got a scarf in the 80s. That's exciting.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.480]  That's the evolution. They haven't really modernized. He's spoiled in 76, unfortunately.
[11:28.800 --> 11:34.360]  Yeah, he's gross. I think that his 1970 look is the best look in the whole thing.
[11:34.360 --> 11:42.300]  The rest of it is so weird. Like the 1961 looks like he's in like a Superman pose and everything. I don't like that.
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.060]  The 1971 is very much like, oh, we're going in like a direction here. And I think it was really smart.
[11:48.300 --> 11:51.860]  And then they just changed it back to grosser green and then gave him a scarf.
[11:52.740 --> 12:00.060]  Geoff, you've been looking for things to fill some space up on your body for tattoos. Maybe go for every Jolly Green Giant.
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.720]  Oh, that's interesting. You know what? I got to get tattooed now that I'm thinking about it.
[12:04.740 --> 12:09.480]  Because we're talking about... Eric and I are brainstorming some ideas on some tattoo related content.
[12:09.680 --> 12:12.460]  I don't have a hot dog tattoo. Oh, you need that?
[12:12.780 --> 12:20.840]  And I don't want to like beat this hot dog thing to death. I've already done now three hot dog episodes on So All Right with some publishing.
[12:21.080 --> 12:21.420]  Oh my God.
[12:21.820 --> 12:24.440]  Yeah, I know. And then all the hot dog related content here.
[12:24.440 --> 12:26.440]  But I got to say, I have never...
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.620]  Protected by Falcons, God bless the Cosmic Crisp Apple, who still shout us out all the time on social media, by the way.
[12:33.740 --> 12:36.520]  Love those guys to death. So many other popular things we've had.
[12:37.260 --> 12:45.200]  Nothing has captured the audience's like fervent imagination and enthusiasm like Hot Dogs has. It's insane.
[12:45.780 --> 12:51.960]  Well, I'm glad that we went back on Hot Dogs. I wanted to address something with you that was hot dog related, Geoff.
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.440]  Bring your spirits up a little bit, because, you know, you just the last episode talking about tough times at the dentist.
[12:58.720 --> 13:06.660]  You have been recently, you brought back your card ripped packs. I fucking destroyed that. That was a terrible.
[13:07.240 --> 13:10.300]  What was the break? It's not the break show. What do you call the daily rip?
[13:10.300 --> 13:13.480]  It was a daily rip. Yeah, I brought it back for like a mission.
[13:13.960 --> 13:19.740]  You did. Yeah, because you were trying. There was a hot dog variant and a top type of tops baseball pack, I believe.
[13:19.740 --> 13:25.520]  What was the top series? Tops 2024 series to baseball has one of the different parallels.
[13:25.620 --> 13:29.700]  They have like summer parallels. Yeah. And one of like a Statue of Liberty fireworks.
[13:29.960 --> 13:38.100]  One of them was a hot dog. And when I found that out, I I decided that I was going to open a pack a day until I got a hot dog parallel.
[13:38.460 --> 13:40.940]  And so I didn't tell you guys about it or anything. I was just doing it.
[13:41.020 --> 13:46.540]  No. Kind of for fun on the side. And on day five, I hit the hot dog parallel. I was very surprised by it.
[13:46.540 --> 13:50.400]  I was excitedly following all of the rips and you finally got it.
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.920]  And I don't think you fully necessarily appreciated how great of a hot dog card you got.
[13:56.140 --> 13:59.940]  So I screencapped it because you didn't mention this at all in the moment.
[14:00.100 --> 14:06.800]  Maybe you have reflected since then, but your man, Matt Strom, that dude's eaten the dog.
[14:07.180 --> 14:11.520]  It's lined up perfectly with his mouth. He's chowing down on a dog.
[14:11.520 --> 14:20.880]  That has to be the best of the hot dog variants. I can't imagine any of them are lined up as good as that.
[14:21.080 --> 14:23.960]  It's incredible. He's just chowing down.
[14:24.160 --> 14:30.420]  I was just so blown away by getting it. I had fully anticipated this taking like 30 or 40 packs.
[14:31.940 --> 14:35.980]  I hadn't seen it. I didn't even notice it until this moment. That is so awesome, Andrew.
[14:36.040 --> 14:37.240]  Thank you for pointing that out.
[14:39.440 --> 14:42.960]  He's just chowing down on a dog. He's Pac-Man.
[14:44.560 --> 14:50.480]  One of my old friends reached out to me the other day. He saw it and he said that guy, Matt Strom, is a big card collector.
[14:50.740 --> 14:53.200]  I was just about to ask, do you know about the card life?
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.700]  Yeah, I don't know about it, but my friend Kevin was telling me that he's real big into card collecting.
[14:58.760 --> 15:00.320]  He has like a belt or something that he wears.
[15:00.600 --> 15:06.240]  He has a belt that like he's all about this belt with cards and all this stuff.
[15:06.240 --> 15:11.980]  He has his own show called The Card Life where he's hosting a show dedicated to sports card collecting.
[15:12.600 --> 15:13.560]  Holy shit.
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.400]  Yeah, he used to be a Padre and then we traded him away or whatever.
[15:17.700 --> 15:21.780]  And then since he's been on, I guess the Phillies is like a relief guy, it's been working out.
[15:21.860 --> 15:25.640]  But like this is his thing. He is super deep in this thing.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.340]  So it's very, very cool. It's very, very cool.
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.740]  Interesting. I'm going to watch his show.
[15:31.100 --> 15:31.220]  Yeah.
[15:31.740 --> 15:34.780]  I learned something about baseball last night at baseball.
[15:36.120 --> 15:38.520]  What did you learn? What did you learn about baseball?
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.680]  The mound is an actual mound.
[15:41.260 --> 15:41.700]  Yeah.
[15:42.340 --> 15:44.200]  It's actually a little bit higher up.
[15:44.520 --> 15:44.740]  Yeah.
[15:45.140 --> 15:45.920]  I had no idea.
[15:46.820 --> 15:49.620]  That's cool. Is that the only thing you learned?
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.360]  Well, it's probably the most obvious thing I learned. Why is it higher?
[15:55.120 --> 15:56.120]  Because it's called the mound.
[15:56.560 --> 15:58.320]  Yeah, but what's the point in throwing from a mound?
[15:58.320 --> 16:02.500]  I believe that it is to give the pitcher an advantage.
[16:02.680 --> 16:08.820]  Because when you're throwing, you get more distance when you're coming off the mound on that stretch.
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.080]  Like your front leg. And you are coming down and forward.
[16:12.420 --> 16:14.360]  And you can throw the ball faster.
[16:14.800 --> 16:17.100]  So if the mound is taller, do you throw it faster?
[16:17.820 --> 16:19.080]  I think that's probably...
[16:19.080 --> 16:21.740]  Probably, yeah. You probably would be able to eke out a little bit.
[16:21.760 --> 16:23.580]  It'd be minuscule, but yeah.
[16:23.640 --> 16:25.240]  I want to see some bigger mounds.
[16:25.980 --> 16:27.220]  A quick Google says,
[16:28.940 --> 16:39.640]  Oh, I disagree. We need to take away the mound.
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.160]  I think that we need to start... I think we need to start doing running pitches.
[16:43.720 --> 16:45.720]  Just like cricket balls in baseball?
[16:46.160 --> 16:46.300]  Yeah.
[16:46.440 --> 16:48.520]  Now I want to see a game of cricket with two mounds.
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.960]  Can you imagine Shohei Otani running at you with a ball in his hand
[16:53.960 --> 16:55.920]  and then throwing it as hard as he can?
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.980]  From a hundred and two right into the small of your back? Yeah.
[16:59.120 --> 17:00.500]  Oh my God.
[17:00.820 --> 17:02.880]  I think we got the plot of Happy Gilmore 3.
[17:04.380 --> 17:06.880]  It's the happy lead up to the pitch.
[17:07.380 --> 17:13.280]  We were talking last night about, would you rather get hit by a fastball
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.700]  or tackled by a linebacker?
[17:15.820 --> 17:17.660]  And where everyone stood on that.
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.260]  There's a lot of layers.
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.920]  How fast is this ball going?
[17:23.560 --> 17:27.500]  Listen, if you're going to get tackled by an NFL linebacker,
[17:27.600 --> 17:29.820]  then we don't get to pick which one,
[17:30.300 --> 17:34.140]  but we can assume a certain size and power level.
[17:34.300 --> 17:37.240]  So I'm going to guess this ball has to be in the nineties.
[17:38.560 --> 17:41.780]  Maybe it's 92, maybe it's 90, maybe it's 101.
[17:42.060 --> 17:43.640]  Maybe it's like Bobby Jenks throwing it,
[17:43.780 --> 17:46.640]  but it's got to be in the nineties somewhere.
[17:46.640 --> 17:47.860]  It's a fastball.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.360]  It's fucking, it's going to hurt.
[17:50.380 --> 17:53.920]  And getting hit by a lineman, are they landing on you?
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.040]  What type of attack is it like going through?
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.000]  Are you just getting bowled over?
[17:58.400 --> 18:03.500]  We determined that you can choose to be hit from a standing still position
[18:03.500 --> 18:05.880]  or hit while running if you would prefer.
[18:06.560 --> 18:08.240]  That's an interesting, that in itself.
[18:08.320 --> 18:10.780]  I think being hit while in motion is the way to go.
[18:11.060 --> 18:13.280]  I think it helps disperse some of the force.
[18:13.900 --> 18:17.300]  Yeah, especially if you're going the opposite direction.
[18:17.620 --> 18:18.700]  You're going a different way.
[18:19.680 --> 18:22.820]  The jolt to your body being hit from a standing still position
[18:22.820 --> 18:24.500]  has got to be pretty damaging, I would think.
[18:24.740 --> 18:26.380]  I think it has to be the lineman, right?
[18:26.620 --> 18:30.400]  Because there's no way a lineman isn't hitting you.
[18:30.740 --> 18:31.100]  I agree.
[18:32.020 --> 18:33.100]  You guys are nuts.
[18:33.260 --> 18:38.480]  All I think about is Johnny Knoxville dying when they take his head off.
[18:38.580 --> 18:40.500]  And it's just like, just hit me, hit me once.
[18:40.580 --> 18:41.400]  You turn your shoulder.
[18:41.840 --> 18:42.920]  You're hopefully getting into the back.
[18:42.920 --> 18:44.480]  It's going to hurt so bad.
[18:45.120 --> 18:48.560]  But, like, even with pads on and everything, dude.
[18:48.680 --> 18:51.140]  Like a linebacker is just going to, he's going to destroy you.
[18:51.160 --> 18:51.500]  Here's the thing.
[18:51.600 --> 18:54.060]  I was imagining if I had to stand and take something,
[18:54.380 --> 18:57.120]  if it was a ball, I could put my hands over my face
[18:57.120 --> 18:58.840]  and it would just smash my hand.
[18:59.280 --> 19:02.440]  But if I put my hands over my face and get tackled by a guy,
[19:02.540 --> 19:04.040]  it's going to hurt either way.
[19:04.120 --> 19:04.460]  You'd have broken arms.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.500]  Dude, but I like, I would, I don't have that much faith in my body.
[19:09.620 --> 19:12.840]  I don't want to end up like Mike Piazza, you know?
[19:12.840 --> 19:14.580]  Like, I don't want brain damage.
[19:14.680 --> 19:16.000]  I don't want to get, I don't want to get,
[19:16.160 --> 19:19.040]  I've seen dudes get broken bones from getting hit by fastballs.
[19:19.200 --> 19:20.240]  Like, that's fucking...
[19:20.240 --> 19:22.020]  You just said you don't want brain damage?
[19:22.500 --> 19:25.660]  So you, so you want to get hit by the linebacker?
[19:25.980 --> 19:29.300]  I just think one hit, it's going to disperse through your body.
[19:29.380 --> 19:31.640]  Your whole body is going to absorb the blow.
[19:32.120 --> 19:35.000]  I think it's going to do, I think it's going to hurt less longer
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.060]  than the intense pain of being hit 80 miles an hour
[19:38.060 --> 19:39.940]  on my shoulder or my elbow or wherever.
[19:40.080 --> 19:41.620]  I think you're, I think you're crazy.
[19:41.620 --> 19:44.020]  I think you're, I think you're, I think you have it totally backwards.
[19:44.120 --> 19:45.300]  I know, I agree with you, Geoff.
[19:45.460 --> 19:46.620]  There you go. I guess it's...
[19:46.620 --> 19:47.520]  I've gone back and forth on this.
[19:47.600 --> 19:49.400]  I think I'm now leaning towards the guy again.
[19:49.900 --> 19:50.260]  Really?
[19:51.020 --> 19:51.300]  Yeah.
[19:51.360 --> 19:51.820]  I think so.
[19:52.220 --> 19:54.280]  Because that's something that actually happens normally.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.260]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[19:56.460 --> 19:57.300]  I mean, we'd get destroyed.
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.000]  I don't know if you've ever seen, there is the great clip of one,
[20:01.240 --> 20:03.860]  remember Pros vs. Joes on Spike?
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.260]  Where it was like athletes against normal dudes.
[20:06.340 --> 20:09.940]  There's a lineman one where it was like trying to like block,
[20:09.940 --> 20:11.140]  or maybe it was a tackle.
[20:11.540 --> 20:14.400]  But there's one of a guy just getting fucking flung
[20:14.400 --> 20:17.400]  by an NFL player that is fantastic.
[20:18.020 --> 20:19.400]  And I would rather do that than,
[20:19.660 --> 20:23.080]  I just feel like a baseball is going to destroy everything it impacts.
[20:23.520 --> 20:25.760]  Where I'm going to get fucked up by the lineman,
[20:25.880 --> 20:28.700]  but I don't, like, it's not necessarily going to break me.
[20:29.100 --> 20:31.620]  Somebody last night at the baseball game was telling us
[20:31.620 --> 20:35.240]  that their mom or their sister or somebody still has a scar
[20:35.240 --> 20:38.020]  from where she got hit with a baseball like 30 years ago.
[20:38.520 --> 20:38.960]  Yeah.
[20:38.960 --> 20:41.960]  It was like, I think maybe, I don't know who it was.
[20:42.020 --> 20:44.440]  But anyway, I just, yeah, I don't know, man.
[20:45.060 --> 20:47.780]  Well, Eric, you also said you had a dented leg or something.
[20:48.060 --> 20:51.700]  Yeah, I got hit with a baseball in the shin, but that's in the shin.
[20:51.880 --> 20:56.580]  I just don't think that getting hit probably in the back by a fastball
[20:56.580 --> 20:59.560]  is something that happens all the time in baseball.
[20:59.880 --> 21:03.480]  And nobody is going, we got to figure out a solution for this.
[21:03.640 --> 21:06.440]  Where it happens all the time in football,
[21:06.480 --> 21:08.260]  and they're making them wear new helmets.
[21:08.860 --> 21:11.160]  Like, they're constantly trying to fix it.
[21:11.180 --> 21:15.120]  Dude, dudes in baseball have fucking elbow guards, wrist guards.
[21:15.200 --> 21:17.440]  Yeah, right. And they have that stuff.
[21:17.900 --> 21:18.800]  And they're not trying...
[21:18.800 --> 21:21.760]  Those are all new solutions, though, that had to be put in place
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.000]  because of how dangerous it is.
[21:23.180 --> 21:25.860]  To blocking specific bone parts.
[21:26.220 --> 21:28.960]  But you block those bone parts and it's hitting you in the back,
[21:29.060 --> 21:29.660]  you're going to be fine.
[21:29.880 --> 21:32.100]  I think you're going to be fine compared to the linebacker.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.800]  The linebacker is going to fuck you up so bad.
[21:34.120 --> 21:36.920]  Like, if I was 21, I think I'd have a different answer.
[21:36.920 --> 21:38.260]  Here's what's going to happen.
[21:38.660 --> 21:41.100]  It's going to ping off your little elbow thing,
[21:41.200 --> 21:44.060]  and it's going to go right up under your neck
[21:44.060 --> 21:46.420]  and hit you in the throat and smash your Adam's apple.
[21:46.760 --> 21:49.820]  And then you're going to fucking choke to death on your own Adam's apple.
[21:50.060 --> 21:52.000]  It's going to be some weird thing like that.
[21:52.140 --> 21:54.580]  It's dangerous the way those things ping off.
[21:55.240 --> 21:58.180]  Compared to the linebacker, that's very, very safe. Yeah, absolutely.
[21:58.300 --> 22:00.840]  But the linebacker, I feel like the transfer of energy is nicer.
[22:01.020 --> 22:05.020]  Like, if I jump at the last minute, and I just go cartwheeling through the air,
[22:05.800 --> 22:07.660]  it's not like a sudden deceleration.
[22:08.240 --> 22:13.200]  I also don't know that I'm going to be able to react fast enough at 49 years old
[22:13.200 --> 22:18.300]  to move to put my back in play when somebody's throwing a ball 98 miles an hour at me.
[22:18.400 --> 22:22.160]  I might see it, recognize what's happening, and then my nose is gone.
[22:22.280 --> 22:22.520]  You know?
[22:23.320 --> 22:27.040]  Eric, if I post a video in the chat, could you screen share for like 30 seconds?
[22:27.260 --> 22:28.680]  Is it the Johnny Knoxville blindside?
[22:28.900 --> 22:32.340]  No, it's not. It's the sports science thing I was talking about.
[22:32.340 --> 22:32.800]  Oh, hell yeah.
[22:32.800 --> 22:35.120]  Four minutes, 15 seconds in.
[22:35.620 --> 22:39.320]  And then if you want to type in on YouTube, sports science, NFL defensive tackle,
[22:39.740 --> 22:41.700]  Chris Jenkins versus Average Joe.
[22:42.220 --> 22:42.860]  Yeah, okay.
[22:43.080 --> 22:46.280]  I guess it wasn't pros versus Joes, but...
[22:46.280 --> 22:46.860]  I'm watching.
[22:47.120 --> 22:49.880]  Okay, I am loading into Eric's feed.
[22:49.880 --> 22:50.300]  It's loading.
[22:50.860 --> 22:52.280]  Yeah, I can see it. Okay.
[22:52.600 --> 22:52.880]  We good?
[22:52.900 --> 22:54.460]  It's like a 10-second clip. Let's do this.
[22:54.680 --> 22:57.460]  So he's hitting play. They're lining up.
[23:00.200 --> 23:02.440]  I mean, that would be terrifying to just stare down.
[23:02.440 --> 23:04.440]  Oh, my God!
[23:07.180 --> 23:08.760]  Look at him leave his feet!
[23:09.380 --> 23:15.980]  He gets hooped, and then flung and lands way before the bag that is supposed to absorb the blood.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.560]  Just instantly.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.520]  Definitely taking that over a fastball.
[23:21.700 --> 23:24.720]  As bad as that looks. Okay, now we're going into the jackass one.
[23:25.040 --> 23:25.340]  Okay.
[23:26.420 --> 23:29.860]  Who is it? Jared something? I don't remember his name. He was on the Vikings forever.
[23:30.900 --> 23:33.260]  I 100% take that over.
[23:34.320 --> 23:36.080]  Like getting hit by a car.
[23:36.340 --> 23:39.020]  Like, that fucking sucks. That's brutal.
[23:41.360 --> 23:47.520]  This is the reason that I'm picking baseball, because of what happens immediately afterwards.
[23:47.900 --> 23:50.460]  This is the guy whose life is being a stuntman.
[23:51.080 --> 23:54.780]  You're doing... Either way, you're on the ground with that.
[23:55.100 --> 23:58.240]  Either scenario, that's you on the ground.
[23:58.240 --> 24:02.540]  Oh, my God. Look at him just...
[24:02.540 --> 24:05.240]  He gets crunched.
[24:07.300 --> 24:08.580]  He's fine. He's fine.
[24:08.820 --> 24:10.280]  Decimated. Decimated.
[24:11.320 --> 24:13.440]  Yeah, I'd rather take that than the ball.
[24:13.480 --> 24:14.140]  You guys are crazy.
[24:15.380 --> 24:16.420]  I think I'd die.
[24:16.920 --> 24:17.400]  Yeah.
[24:17.660 --> 24:17.920]  With the ball.
[24:18.520 --> 24:21.780]  I don't like sharp pain. Like acute pain, you know?
[24:22.240 --> 24:27.120]  There's something about it being another human that makes it less intimidating to me than a ball.
[24:31.400 --> 24:33.080]  Still the Regulation Apple.
[24:33.240 --> 24:38.640]  Cosmic Crisp is back with their continued support of us and you, the Regulation community.
[24:38.860 --> 24:42.520]  This is a real ad from Cosmic Crisp.
[24:43.100 --> 24:44.680]  You guys have made this happen.
[24:45.200 --> 24:46.300]  Worlds are colliding.
[24:46.760 --> 24:50.920]  This is Cosmic Crisp Apples and Regulation podcast.
[24:51.540 --> 24:52.340]  Here's the thing.
[24:52.500 --> 24:58.360]  October is National Apple Month, and it's a great time to stock up on Cosmic Crisps,
[24:58.360 --> 25:00.340]  because they take so long to turn.
[25:00.980 --> 25:02.520]  We've talked about it so many times.
[25:02.640 --> 25:03.820]  You know all these facts already.
[25:03.900 --> 25:05.140]  You already know that they're super crisp.
[25:05.380 --> 25:06.700]  You already know they're exceptionally juicy.
[25:07.040 --> 25:09.120]  And you already know they're beautifully bi-colored.
[25:09.560 --> 25:16.000]  The balance of sweet, tart flavor of Cosmic Crisp is perfect for however you enjoy apples.
[25:16.180 --> 25:16.920]  Bake them in a pie.
[25:17.020 --> 25:18.760]  I think we have a video coming out about that eventually.
[25:18.920 --> 25:19.760]  You can make applesauce.
[25:19.840 --> 25:21.000]  You can just post it on social media.
[25:21.140 --> 25:25.880]  You can keep it in your fridge for a really long time, because they naturally slow to brown.
[25:26.020 --> 25:27.420]  And they're non-GMO.
[25:27.420 --> 25:29.520]  They're available in grocery stores nationwide.
[25:29.720 --> 25:32.040]  Guys, it's the Cosmic Crisp Apple.
[25:32.320 --> 25:33.620]  We talk about it all the time.
[25:33.880 --> 25:35.320]  We love the Cosmic Crisp Apple.
[25:35.560 --> 25:36.560]  We can't say it enough.
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.380]  It's THE regulation apple.
[25:39.940 --> 25:42.040]  There is no apple above this.
[25:42.260 --> 25:43.400]  Put them all on a list.
[25:43.540 --> 25:44.200]  Cosmic Crisp.
[25:44.420 --> 25:44.740]  Boom.
[25:45.200 --> 25:45.900]  Number one.
[25:46.140 --> 25:46.780]  That's where I'd put it.
[25:47.140 --> 25:49.100]  I've also had the Cosmic Crisp Hard Cider.
[25:49.260 --> 25:50.520]  I think it's great also.
[25:50.680 --> 25:54.060]  Look, a Cosmic Crisp is the apple for us, and it should be the apple for you.

[26:03.560 --> 26:06.800]  They love to hear from you, the Regulation Podcast fans.
[26:08.620 --> 26:14.980]  I know the math behind it doesn't make sense, but I'm not scared of a grape being dropped on me from the Empire State Building.
[26:16.020 --> 26:16.980]  A grape?
[26:17.220 --> 26:19.400]  Yeah, like something small and absorbable.
[26:21.060 --> 26:22.500]  Like a kiwi fruit.
[26:22.980 --> 26:24.820]  Like, I know the velocity...
[26:24.820 --> 26:26.480]  A kiwi would be much worse than a grape.
[26:26.880 --> 26:29.740]  Oh, they're both small, they're both... like, in my head, it's no problem.
[26:30.380 --> 26:34.660]  I can catch a grape in my mouth from the Empire State. A kiwi would go through my face.
[26:35.380 --> 26:39.560]  I think they would both do a lot of damage realistically, but because it's so small...
[26:40.400 --> 26:40.940]  A grape?
[26:41.640 --> 26:42.420]  Yeah, because of the speed.
[26:42.420 --> 26:45.240]  What's the terminal velocity of a grape? Like, 20 miles an hour?
[26:45.740 --> 26:47.900]  Well, wait, does it max out?
[26:49.980 --> 26:50.780]  Well, yeah.
[26:52.540 --> 26:54.220]  What's the max speed of a grape?
[26:55.360 --> 26:58.420]  I feel like you can throw a grape faster than you can drop one.
[26:59.540 --> 27:01.760]  Wait, how does that... wait.
[27:02.900 --> 27:05.340]  Because of, like, wind resistance. Air resistance.
[27:05.960 --> 27:08.380]  Okay, well, that's... you know what, you bring up a good point.
[27:09.040 --> 27:11.100]  They're just so light, I don't think they would...
[27:11.100 --> 27:15.140]  I'm just... I'm such a fan of... is there, like... and you're asking if there's a maximum.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.560]  Well, here's the thing, even if you could throw a grape as hard as you possibly could into my mouth, way less damage than a kiwi.
[27:23.200 --> 27:24.040]  Should we try?
[27:26.300 --> 27:29.660]  Should we put a grape in the hot dog cannon and fire it in Gavin's face?
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.800]  But you see, that's gonna be faster than terminal velocity.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.180]  The terminal velocity of a grape is about 65 miles an hour.
[27:36.460 --> 27:36.860]  Right.
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.360]  I would not want to get hit.
[27:38.360 --> 27:41.280]  Whereas if you fight it from a cannon, you could probably get a 200 mile an hour grape.
[27:41.700 --> 27:42.860]  That would suck too.
[27:44.060 --> 27:47.740]  I think you would... would you die?
[27:47.920 --> 27:49.280]  What's the terminal velocity of a kiwi?
[27:49.640 --> 27:55.240]  Somebody specifically left a Quora question that said, will a grape falling from the 22nd floor harm a child?
[27:57.460 --> 27:58.260]  What's the answer?
[27:58.780 --> 27:59.460]  I found my other account.
[27:59.540 --> 28:03.740]  A terminal velocity is 65 miles an hour, it might leave a bruise if it hits their shoulder.
[28:05.760 --> 28:11.140]  Okay. I feel... I've had arguments about this in the past. I feel like I was on the right side, based on this conversation.
[28:11.140 --> 28:11.980]  And what side was that?
[28:12.500 --> 28:15.780]  That I'm not really that worried about the grape falling from the Empire State Building.
[28:15.880 --> 28:16.760]  No, yeah, I think you're fine.
[28:17.160 --> 28:17.880]  I think I'd be okay.
[28:18.640 --> 28:20.600]  Even like a... well now, an orange would be a problem.
[28:21.420 --> 28:22.760]  Apple would be disastrous.
[28:23.380 --> 28:27.480]  I mean, you could have something that's smaller than a grape, but more dense, would do a lot more damage.
[28:28.240 --> 28:30.260]  What's denser than a grape, but smaller?
[28:30.620 --> 28:31.960]  A pinball? Ball bearing?
[28:33.060 --> 28:33.420]  Coin?
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.760]  I know. No, I meant in the context of fruit. Not in general, I thought we were talking fruit.
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.720]  I thought you were... I went immediately like, I can list probably ten things.
[28:43.820 --> 28:44.740]  Yeah, no, right.
[28:44.960 --> 28:48.180]  No, I'm not. That was intended to be in the realm of fruit, not...
[28:48.180 --> 28:51.160]  In the context of fruit, I would say a cherry is denser than a grape.
[28:51.160 --> 28:52.420]  Oh, that's an interesting... yeah.
[28:52.880 --> 28:54.000]  And has a seed in it.
[28:54.020 --> 28:54.640]  Yeah, a seed.
[28:54.880 --> 28:57.120]  A pit. It's gonna fuck you up. An olive.
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.360]  Be like a xenomorph. The fucking... the seed launches out upon impact, does extra damage.
[29:05.180 --> 29:06.240]  Stems from its core.
[29:07.180 --> 29:14.880]  I was just gonna say, I have a quick other, you know, Geoff card thing. I got another Geoff update related thing for you guys. Very exciting.
[29:15.900 --> 29:19.040]  Update on the balloon. As of this morning.
[29:19.260 --> 29:19.700]  A new picture?
[29:20.100 --> 29:22.860]  New picture. Balloon's still up. Still living.
[29:23.560 --> 29:31.540]  I'm pretty sure that that is a vent, and it is sucking the balloon into the vent, and that's the only thing that is keeping that balloon up.
[29:31.860 --> 29:32.740]  Pretty sure of that, are you?
[29:32.920 --> 29:36.060]  Has the air conditioning been on for, like, two weeks straight?
[29:36.460 --> 29:38.820]  Well, it's just, it's on automatic or whatever.
[29:39.680 --> 29:42.560]  Yeah, that... usually it comes on and off, that means it's...
[29:42.560 --> 29:43.980]  I think it's still up there on helium.
[29:44.460 --> 29:45.960]  Maybe it's still...
[29:45.960 --> 29:47.560]  Or it's, like, wedged in a little bit.
[29:48.360 --> 29:49.760]  I think it could be wedged.
[29:50.240 --> 29:50.500]  Yeah.
[29:50.860 --> 30:00.380]  Because I tried to get it out of that corner, and it started to fall, so I had to remove weight from the balloon to get it back in the sky.
[30:01.440 --> 30:05.700]  And it went up, and then it immediately ended up in that corner again, and I haven't touched it since.
[30:05.860 --> 30:07.220]  It's where it wants to be.
[30:07.320 --> 30:10.040]  It's where it wants to be. And that's my great corner update.
[30:10.120 --> 30:10.960]  Geoff, what were you going to say?
[30:11.400 --> 30:13.940]  I was just going to say, summer is officially over now.
[30:14.880 --> 30:18.400]  We're through summer, and we're in the spummer, I guess.
[30:19.560 --> 30:24.920]  But I looked up the... because we talked about it earlier, I looked up the songs of the summer.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.840]  The Billboard Top Ten Global Songs of the Summer for 2024.
[30:28.840 --> 30:34.040]  And I was wondering if you guys had your finger on the pulse enough to be able to name any of them.
[30:34.160 --> 30:38.460]  What would you guys think Billboard would say the song of the summer was?
[30:39.420 --> 30:44.440]  I think the Double Shot of Whiskey song is up there.
[30:44.440 --> 30:48.420]  Yeah, that one's up there, and I think Espresso is probably on there.
[30:50.360 --> 30:55.060]  I would say probably... oh, Not Like Us.
[30:55.580 --> 30:57.220]  Yeah, that has to be the number one.
[30:57.220 --> 31:00.520]  If it's not number one, it's definitely in the top five.
[31:02.540 --> 31:04.140]  What else was big on TikTok?
[31:05.020 --> 31:05.820]  What was that song?
[31:06.000 --> 31:07.960]  I remember papa said, baby.
[31:08.140 --> 31:11.940]  That one that you never heard the full song of? Million Dollar Baby? That's probably on there.
[31:12.620 --> 31:13.780]  What about that Apple one?
[31:14.580 --> 31:17.780]  No, I think that came out too late for it to be on there.
[31:18.240 --> 31:22.040]  What about... I like my whiskey.
[31:23.420 --> 31:25.280]  That one. You know that one?
[31:25.280 --> 31:26.600]  Yeah, I know that one.
[31:28.940 --> 31:29.340]  Pavarazzi?
[31:29.800 --> 31:30.940]  I think you're probably... what?
[31:31.300 --> 31:35.960]  I think I know what you're talking about, but I don't want to say it and be wrong and give one away.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.040]  Is that a Hozier? Did Hozier sing that?
[31:42.060 --> 31:43.240]  Yes, I think he did.
[31:45.100 --> 31:48.400]  We said Espresso, but I think Please Please Please is probably on there also.
[31:48.920 --> 31:53.380]  And if that's on there, that means that Billie Eilish song is on there, Birds of a Feather.
[31:53.380 --> 31:56.460]  That might be too recent. Otherwise, you're right.
[31:56.600 --> 31:57.020]  No shot.
[31:57.460 --> 32:02.300]  You guys are so good at this. I'm so impressed with you.
[32:02.320 --> 32:05.800]  It's just the stuff that you hear on TikTok on repeat.
[32:06.280 --> 32:08.500]  But you guys nailed it. You guys got almost everything.
[32:08.660 --> 32:14.780]  Number 10, I don't know what it is, but number 10 is Gatta Only by Floyd Menor x Chris MJ.
[32:15.220 --> 32:15.780]  I don't know.
[32:15.940 --> 32:17.700]  Which is like their gamer tag, I guess.
[32:18.320 --> 32:21.980]  Number 9 is That Too Sweet by Hozier.
[32:21.980 --> 32:26.540]  Number 8 is something called Million Dollar Baby by Tommy Richman.
[32:26.680 --> 32:27.180]  That's it.
[32:27.740 --> 32:31.460]  Number 7 is Beautiful Things by Benson Boone.
[32:32.400 --> 32:33.400]  I don't know what that is.
[32:33.720 --> 32:38.140]  Number 6 is I Had Some Help by Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen.
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.380]  That Morgan Wallen song.
[32:39.800 --> 32:41.520]  That's his country crossover shit.
[32:41.800 --> 32:43.860]  Number 5 is Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar.
[32:43.940 --> 32:46.100]  Number 4 is Please Please Please by Serena Carpenter.
[32:46.520 --> 32:50.160]  Number 3 is A Bar Song Tipsy by Shaboosie.
[32:50.160 --> 32:51.460]  Oh, that's... yeah.
[32:52.120 --> 32:54.320]  And then number 2 is Billie Eilish's Birds of a Feather.
[32:54.420 --> 32:56.360]  Number 1 was Serena Carpenter's Espresso.
[32:56.420 --> 32:59.020]  So the song of the summer was Espresso by Serena Carpenter.
[32:59.160 --> 33:01.020]  I called that going into the summer.
[33:01.120 --> 33:05.040]  The first time I heard that song, I went, oh, this is going to be everywhere, all the time.
[33:05.640 --> 33:08.660]  Am I crazy, though? That's already a song, right?
[33:08.760 --> 33:10.060]  Like, that's been a song before.
[33:10.720 --> 33:10.960]  What?
[33:11.540 --> 33:12.340]  I don't know what you mean.
[33:12.960 --> 33:17.200]  Like, she released it previously, or you recognize it sounds similar to something else?
[33:17.200 --> 33:21.640]  It sounds like 95% of the way to a song that's old.
[33:21.980 --> 33:22.640]  What song?
[33:23.060 --> 33:25.560]  I don't know. It's been pissing me off for three months.
[33:25.820 --> 33:35.460]  No, like, do you know the story behind the song is the producer took, like, sample stuff from...
[33:35.460 --> 33:36.840]  Oh, what the fuck is that website?
[33:37.600 --> 33:44.780]  There's like a sampling website where you can just download, hey, get like these samples and then you adjust them and everything.
[33:44.780 --> 33:51.300]  He just took the straight samples and then plussed up sort of like some background around it and then repeated it.
[33:51.340 --> 33:54.080]  And that's the song. Like, nobody performed anything on it.
[33:54.180 --> 33:55.980]  He just got like two samples.
[33:56.240 --> 33:56.540]  A GarageBand demo?
[33:56.860 --> 34:00.240]  Yeah. It was just like, oh, here's two samples, put it together, and that was it.
[34:00.660 --> 34:04.400]  This song cost me $17 to make off SoundDogs.com.
[34:04.400 --> 34:06.680]  Uh, yeah, right. It was, uh...
[34:06.680 --> 34:16.240]  So he went to... the main riff and drums featured on the song are loops from a Splice sample track called Power Tools Sample Pack 3.
[34:16.820 --> 34:19.040]  God, it's Power Tools. That's so funny.
[34:19.600 --> 34:29.780]  Well, it's like the, like, gonging sound in Beat It by Michael Jackson was like just a sound demo from...
[34:29.780 --> 34:32.460]  It was like a synthesizer demo disc.
[34:32.460 --> 34:35.000]  And he just took the whole thing and put it in the song.
[34:35.080 --> 34:37.100]  Oh, wow. That's crazy.
[34:37.580 --> 34:38.740]  Stuff like that is awesome.
[34:39.140 --> 34:44.400]  Like, there's one relatively recently I saw of Gorillaz, Clint Eastwood.
[34:44.540 --> 34:48.020]  The whole, like, thing was the default for a keyboard he bought.
[34:48.500 --> 34:51.080]  Like, the entire rhythm of it. Like, he didn't come up with any of it.
[34:51.840 --> 34:54.500]  I saw one recently with the Leica G6.
[34:54.760 --> 35:01.700]  Like, the kind of alarm in that was an accidentally made sound because he put the bell into the wrong track.
[35:01.700 --> 35:05.040]  That was intended for bass. Oh, I love that stuff for music.
[35:05.260 --> 35:11.280]  There's an Action Bronson song where he raps over the hold music at, like, a limo company or something.
[35:11.420 --> 35:12.820]  And he just turns it into a whole song.
[35:13.140 --> 35:14.220]  I thought that was funny.
[35:15.060 --> 35:15.540]  That's great.
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.640]  All that shit is stuff like Shaggy's It Wasn't Me.
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.560]  The vocals on that were like a test recording.
[35:24.680 --> 35:30.880]  Like, they're not even, like, finalized properly recorded vocals because it was uncertain if that would even be a song.
[35:30.880 --> 35:36.100]  I find listening about, like, how music and records are produced so interesting.
[35:36.500 --> 35:40.560]  Oh, yeah, I love that. Gavin, what did you just send that sounds like something from Crash Bandicoot?
[35:42.600 --> 35:43.740]  Are you at the right time?
[35:43.920 --> 35:45.740]  I don't know. What time am I supposed to be at?
[35:47.540 --> 35:49.220]  Like, 7-11, I guess?
[35:49.500 --> 35:49.680]  Okay.
[35:50.820 --> 35:52.960]  What am I listening to?
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.420]  You think that sounds like a Sparrow link?
[35:57.940 --> 35:58.460]  You might have.
[35:59.540 --> 36:01.200]  I don't know what...
[36:01.200 --> 36:01.440]  You think that's Espresso?
[36:01.720 --> 36:03.600]  You said 7-11. I don't know.
[36:03.700 --> 36:04.800]  7-15.
[36:07.660 --> 36:10.320]  Okay, so that's not... Jesus Christ.
[36:10.540 --> 36:11.380]  That was really loud.
[36:11.880 --> 36:12.620]  Yeah, it's the gong.
[36:13.760 --> 36:14.280]  Right.
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.940]  I thought we were still talking about Espresso with you.
[36:17.900 --> 36:19.000]  I thought you found it.
[36:19.700 --> 36:22.720]  No, he found the gong thing from the Michael Jackson thing.
[36:23.100 --> 36:27.100]  But what he linked to at 7-11 sounds like something from Crash Bandicoot.
[36:27.100 --> 36:32.940]  Yeah, I just was looking at the comments because my sound isn't coming through right.
[36:32.940 --> 36:36.640]  It sounds like Jerry trying to Twinkle Toes sneak by Tom.
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.160]  Why did Michael Jackson use that instead of the gong sound?
[36:43.880 --> 36:48.400]  Last night, we were talking about songs we'd heard the most in our lives.
[36:48.540 --> 36:52.280]  And I said the National Anthem is probably way up there for me.
[36:52.660 --> 36:54.980]  And then we were saying like, oh, Geoff, you probably heard that a lot in the Army.
[36:54.980 --> 36:58.200]  And then we're like, oh, no, what's the song they play?
[36:58.380 --> 37:04.400]  And Geoff and Nick started humming Duel of the Fates.
[37:05.660 --> 37:07.500]  That's the song they woke up to.
[37:07.560 --> 37:08.460]  The Army song.
[37:11.060 --> 37:12.980]  And we all just started going...
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.660]  Nick thought that was revelry.
[37:25.440 --> 37:31.740]  With the transition from summer into fall, NFL season is on.
[37:31.840 --> 37:34.960]  We did a kicker picker. We all picked kickers.
[37:35.380 --> 37:39.320]  We're tracking that throughout the next few months, seeing who will get the most points.
[37:39.900 --> 37:41.840]  The field goals and extra points.
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.380]  We also did as part of... I thought, you know, it'd be so much fun for the August Falcon event
[37:48.380 --> 37:52.400]  if we did an eliminator pool, which is something I've never done before,
[37:52.580 --> 37:54.360]  but I've always wanted to do it.
[37:54.360 --> 37:55.560]  It always seems like fun.
[37:55.900 --> 37:59.700]  The idea being that you pick one team every week.
[37:59.820 --> 38:03.760]  And if the team you pick is... if they lose, you're eliminated.
[38:04.140 --> 38:07.940]  If they win, you continue, but you can't pick that team again.
[38:08.020 --> 38:09.360]  They're eliminated from your choices.
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.860]  So I organized a whole Falcon thing around it.
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.460]  I made, I think, 11 different leagues so that we could have multiple winners,
[38:17.540 --> 38:18.440]  which I thought was fun.
[38:19.240 --> 38:21.120]  Put it all together. We started it.
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.540]  And I said to the... I pitched this the night before to everybody here,
[38:25.640 --> 38:27.240]  letting them know that I had done this.
[38:27.500 --> 38:29.620]  And we were going to share an account.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.480]  And we'd go in and egg order.
[38:31.780 --> 38:33.180]  Me starting first.
[38:33.480 --> 38:37.280]  Then we'd go to Nick and Eric, Geoff and Gavin,
[38:37.580 --> 38:40.560]  and see how long we could keep this chain going.
[38:41.160 --> 38:42.640]  I was real excited about it.
[38:43.240 --> 38:46.260]  And how far did we get, guys?
[38:46.420 --> 38:49.860]  Who's ready for your next... your pick?
[38:49.860 --> 38:52.320]  Do you want to talk about your awesome fucking pick?
[38:52.620 --> 38:54.900]  Yeah, you're a really smart, good pick.
[38:55.680 --> 38:57.340]  I could pick any team.
[38:57.600 --> 38:59.380]  And I scrolled through and I was like,
[38:59.460 --> 39:02.640]  well, the first week, you know, you want to go for a favorite
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.420]  because you don't necessarily know how bad the other teams are.
[39:06.480 --> 39:09.480]  So I went with the Bengals against the Patriots in week one.
[39:09.880 --> 39:14.500]  And I didn't even pay attention to that game until late into the morning.
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.060]  And I checked and the Bengals were down by, I believe, nine or eight
[39:19.060 --> 39:22.180]  when I looked and I said, what the fuck is happening?
[39:23.760 --> 39:27.240]  And we're out of the pool. We're eliminated.
[39:27.760 --> 39:29.520]  I am so sorry, guys.
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.640]  Fucking week one, dude.
[39:31.740 --> 39:34.380]  We were out before I even understood what you were doing.
[39:34.540 --> 39:36.000]  He still doesn't understand what you did.
[39:36.040 --> 39:37.260]  I still don't.
[39:37.340 --> 39:42.340]  It was less than 24 hours from me describing what we were going to do
[39:42.340 --> 39:47.800]  and how we're going to rotate who makes the picks to me eliminating us from the pool.
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.780]  There are plenty of other Falcons still in it and I'm tracking it and I'm watching.
[39:53.060 --> 39:55.640]  It's a lot of fun, but I fucking suck.
[39:55.980 --> 39:57.420]  I'm bad at this, apparently.
[39:57.640 --> 39:59.280]  So do the Falcons already know that we're out?
[40:00.340 --> 40:02.980]  In some of the leagues, it's very obvious.
[40:03.140 --> 40:04.160]  In other leagues, no.
[40:04.300 --> 40:07.960]  But now they will all know that we are out of this race.
[40:08.420 --> 40:13.520]  I watched that whole Bengals game because it's in my scrubs, as I call it.
[40:14.440 --> 40:16.920]  And it was a train wreck. It was unbelievable.
[40:16.920 --> 40:19.260]  Also, Ramondre Stevenson looks awesome this season.
[40:20.360 --> 40:25.560]  In my defense, I think it was probably the biggest upset of the weekend.
[40:25.900 --> 40:27.400]  Probably the biggest upset.
[40:27.880 --> 40:31.440]  They were huge underdogs, the Patriots, going into that matchup.
[40:31.520 --> 40:32.480]  Nobody had them winning.
[40:33.200 --> 40:33.860]  No, it's true.
[40:34.020 --> 40:36.060]  I don't think anybody on Earth thought that they were going to win that game.
[40:36.940 --> 40:40.180]  And I picked them and we got eliminated from the pool.
[40:40.760 --> 40:44.920]  But that's not only where my fucking luck ends with football.
[40:44.920 --> 40:47.540]  It's been a terrible start for me and the NFL.
[40:47.820 --> 40:51.300]  We did a Kicker Picker, which is a supplemental you can watch or listen to.
[40:51.440 --> 40:52.760]  Where we went through the NFL.
[40:52.920 --> 40:54.700]  We each picked kickers.
[40:55.020 --> 40:57.140]  We have a roster of kickers.
[40:57.700 --> 41:05.260]  And part of that process that we discuss is if a kicker gets hurt or they get released or whatever,
[41:05.360 --> 41:06.700]  you cannot replace them.
[41:07.880 --> 41:10.480]  And I got betrayed by Cade York.
[41:10.480 --> 41:16.660]  Cade York, one of my picks, got fucking fired from his job in week one.
[41:18.100 --> 41:20.380]  He is cut from the team.
[41:21.220 --> 41:21.300]  Why?
[41:21.860 --> 41:25.040]  Because he missed two kicks in the first week.
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.000]  And so the team fired him.
[41:28.620 --> 41:32.000]  And I'm down a kicker unless somebody else hires.
[41:32.200 --> 41:32.700]  Look at him.
[41:32.820 --> 41:35.580]  I picked him because he had this dumb smile.
[41:35.920 --> 41:37.340]  He seems so happy.
[41:37.560 --> 41:39.060]  But everyone else is serious.
[41:39.880 --> 41:42.400]  And I now have beef with Cade York.
[41:42.520 --> 41:46.740]  I mean, I'm sure he's more upset than I am that he doesn't have a job currently.
[41:47.400 --> 41:48.620]  What team was he on?
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.320]  He was on the Commanders.
[41:50.500 --> 41:51.920]  He was the Washington Commanders kicker.
[41:52.160 --> 41:54.640]  Did you have an acronym that that now fucks up for you?
[41:55.180 --> 41:55.500]  No.
[41:56.020 --> 41:57.440]  Oh. Well, never mind.
[41:58.480 --> 41:59.840]  I can't remember all that.
[42:00.100 --> 42:01.300]  It's just so much to remember.
[42:01.580 --> 42:04.620]  You've got to watch six teams and follow six teams all at once.
[42:04.640 --> 42:05.120]  It's hard.
[42:05.600 --> 42:06.900]  Now that he's not kicking for them,
[42:06.900 --> 42:09.800]  can we hire him if ever we need something kicked?
[42:10.800 --> 42:12.280]  What? Do you need something kicked?
[42:12.880 --> 42:13.320]  No.
[42:13.460 --> 42:15.820]  Not currently, but it's nice to have an official kicker for us.
[42:15.820 --> 42:17.200]  Okay, well, let me rephrase that question.
[42:17.740 --> 42:19.640]  Do you need something kicked accurately?
[42:23.300 --> 42:25.320]  As if not, I got your guy.
[42:26.300 --> 42:28.020]  Kick a kiwi into my mouth.
[42:28.860 --> 42:29.300]  Oh.
[42:30.180 --> 42:31.040]  Aim small, miss small.
[42:32.880 --> 42:35.940]  Do you think it would be juicier to have a kiwi kicked into your mouth
[42:35.940 --> 42:37.180]  than if you were to bite into it?
[42:37.680 --> 42:38.220]  The explosion?
[42:38.740 --> 42:38.940]  Yeah.
[42:39.320 --> 42:40.880]  There'd be an explosion of teeth, alright.
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.160]  Can I add something to... are we still doing the supplemental stuff tomorrow?
[42:46.680 --> 42:46.880]  Yeah.
[42:47.360 --> 42:47.800]  I think so.
[42:48.180 --> 42:49.560]  Can I add something to the itinerary?
[42:50.040 --> 42:50.240]  Yeah.
[42:50.920 --> 42:56.780]  Eric told me that there is no amount of blue cheese on something that is too much.
[42:57.140 --> 42:59.240]  Oh no. Oh no.
[42:59.380 --> 43:00.520]  I love blue cheese.
[43:00.800 --> 43:04.680]  I want to make something that's pretty heavily loaded with blue cheese
[43:04.680 --> 43:06.100]  to see if Eric can get through it.
[43:06.200 --> 43:08.680]  I think that's a good idea. Also, should we...
[43:09.420 --> 43:14.800]  And I don't know if I'll be able to do it, so I'm asking the group because I have a washing machine repairman coming at 9am.
[43:15.200 --> 43:19.400]  But should we pick up all that candy that we talked about so we can do the blind taste test with Gavin?
[43:19.700 --> 43:20.160]  Oh yeah.
[43:20.500 --> 43:22.680]  From the supplemental. That'd be easy to accomplish now.
[43:22.920 --> 43:26.180]  I mean, do we want to meet at a different time tomorrow or is that time still good?
[43:26.700 --> 43:29.660]  The time is still good. There just might be a guy outside the room fixing the washer.
[43:30.140 --> 43:32.560]  Okay, but then we have to go get the candy, right?
[43:33.620 --> 43:36.080]  I was just getting to see if somebody could pick it up beforehand.
[43:36.640 --> 43:39.500]  So here's what the issue is with what we're talking about.
[43:40.620 --> 43:41.380]  We is not me.
[43:42.620 --> 43:45.920]  That's why I'm addressing the group. We could be Nick, it could be Gavin.
[43:46.320 --> 43:49.140]  It could be anybody could pick the candy up today.
[43:49.320 --> 43:51.660]  Is anyone, any four of you going out today?
[43:52.660 --> 43:56.060]  You know what? I can go pick up the candy today after this. I'll do that.
[43:56.380 --> 43:58.020]  I just need a list of what to get.
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.000]  Eric has turned we is not me into me never is... what?
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.180]  I never said Eric's name. I addressed the group.
[44:05.420 --> 44:09.500]  And I said, could somebody maybe, if I can't do it.
[44:09.680 --> 44:10.800]  And then Eric said, it's not me.
[44:10.980 --> 44:13.580]  And I was like, I get it. I didn't say you, but it could be Gavin. It could be Nick.
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.980]  That's how all that went. Yeah, that sounds right.
[44:16.300 --> 44:18.600]  I mean, isn't that how that went? Am I crazy?
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.180]  Yes. You could have it even delivered to you.
[44:22.520 --> 44:25.940]  Am I crazy? Did you really think I was talking to you?
[44:26.260 --> 44:28.460]  Yes, because that's the way to address everyone.
[44:28.840 --> 44:30.240]  I didn't get that tool.
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.480]  No, because here's the issue. And I'm fine with it.
[44:33.740 --> 44:37.240]  I'm fine. I'm fine with I'm fine with talking about it and figuring it out.
[44:37.340 --> 44:46.300]  I'm trying to get ahead of it because a lot of this is like I get worried when we go into these things late that something falls.
[44:46.380 --> 44:53.120]  And then the supplemental that we wanted to do, we couldn't do it because I didn't get around to it because the rest of my day is packed.
[44:53.120 --> 44:59.760]  But Jesus Christ, dude, that's why I addressed the group and said, can somebody get the fucking candy ahead of time?
[44:59.760 --> 45:03.020]  So we're not caught flat footed. I didn't say, Eric, can you get the candy?
[45:03.320 --> 45:07.680]  I was addressing the group as I don't know why you took it as you. I was.
[45:07.780 --> 45:10.080]  No, you're right. I apologize. No, you're right.
[45:10.420 --> 45:16.620]  I just don't want us to be stuck in the room and realize that we could have made more than we than we're going to.
[45:16.780 --> 45:19.000]  And yeah, I will take on the candy.
[45:19.520 --> 45:22.080]  I don't want to make this even more complicated, but we could also try potatoes.
[45:22.080 --> 45:25.440]  You is they. I think that's a great idea as well.
[45:25.460 --> 45:30.380]  Well, it's funny me is we what?
[45:30.800 --> 45:33.520]  What? I'm going to make I'm lost.
[45:33.860 --> 45:35.340]  Oh, I was never found.
[45:35.740 --> 45:39.720]  Um, speaking of potato toast.
[45:40.460 --> 45:42.040]  Yeah, I came prepared.
[45:42.500 --> 45:44.960]  Oh, you got some. I have.
[45:46.040 --> 45:47.820]  Created a sandwich.
[45:48.600 --> 45:51.240]  I open or closed open.
[45:51.540 --> 45:58.000]  It is the open faced mash hash cash sandwich is what I've created.
[45:59.660 --> 46:02.360]  Now, a slight wrinkle with it.
[46:02.500 --> 46:06.080]  I ordered all this stuff this morning to make it.
[46:06.500 --> 46:10.620]  And I did not know that the mashed potatoes would automatically come with gravy.
[46:10.880 --> 46:14.360]  That was not stated in the thing.
[46:15.220 --> 46:22.240]  Let me take a photo of open the open face mash hash cash sandwich.
[46:22.500 --> 46:23.660]  Now, what an open face.
[46:23.820 --> 46:26.580]  How can the gravy be already in mash hash cash sandwiches?
[46:26.860 --> 46:28.160]  You have your toast.
[46:28.660 --> 46:32.640]  You have the mash on top of the toast.
[46:33.200 --> 46:38.140]  You have then some hash browns on top of the mash.
[46:38.400 --> 46:40.980]  And then I had a I'm going to be honest.
[46:40.980 --> 46:48.980]  It was originally going to be the open face mash hash stash sandwich because I had a fake mustache somewhere in my desk.
[46:49.100 --> 46:50.580]  But I couldn't find it.
[46:50.820 --> 46:52.900]  However, I did find a five dollar bill.
[46:53.300 --> 46:54.520]  Pretty good day for me.
[46:54.780 --> 46:56.660]  And it also still rhymes with mash.
[46:57.100 --> 46:57.940]  So what did you eat?
[46:58.140 --> 46:59.720]  Did you eat around the five?
[47:00.080 --> 47:01.820]  No, I haven't tried it yet.
[47:02.280 --> 47:03.500]  I was waiting.
[47:03.760 --> 47:05.980]  There are no bites taken out of this.
[47:06.040 --> 47:08.320]  Half of the bread's been eaten.
[47:08.580 --> 47:09.760]  No, it's I just put.
[47:09.760 --> 47:17.140]  I ordered toast and I get I was given two full slices, but they were cut in halves and I didn't have utensils.
[47:17.320 --> 47:22.260]  So that was the best I could do without getting gravy everywhere because I want to go downstairs.
[47:23.380 --> 47:25.380]  I did this in the small.
[47:25.560 --> 47:26.000]  Whatever.
[47:26.240 --> 47:26.780]  Doesn't matter.
[47:27.100 --> 47:27.620]  Are you not?
[47:27.680 --> 47:36.700]  Can you not just be happy that I have the open faced mash hash hash sandwich and instead criticize all these small details?
[47:36.880 --> 47:38.660]  Is that bag of peanuts behind it?
[47:38.660 --> 47:40.820]  No, those are it's called dragon boat mix.
[47:40.920 --> 47:42.420]  They sell it at save on foods.
[47:42.520 --> 47:43.200]  It's delicious.
[47:43.640 --> 47:44.780]  It looks good.
[47:44.920 --> 47:47.120]  Peanuts with a shell casing.
[47:47.960 --> 47:48.900]  It's a little shell.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.440]  I don't know what the shell is made of, but it's peanuts in a shell.
[47:51.760 --> 47:52.420]  Very good.
[47:52.620 --> 48:00.780]  But it is probably not as good as the open faced mash hash hash sandwich, which I'm prepared to take a bite of.
[48:01.180 --> 48:02.300]  So you've not tried any yet?
[48:02.820 --> 48:04.660]  Haven't tried a bite yet.
[48:05.020 --> 48:07.660]  I've noticed that the entire plate is on top of your keyboard.
[48:08.720 --> 48:11.240]  No, on top of my laptop, actually.
[48:11.600 --> 48:11.820]  Okay.
[48:12.300 --> 48:13.180]  Which has a keyboard.
[48:13.620 --> 48:14.760]  Which does have a keyboard.
[48:15.780 --> 48:16.440]  That is correct.
[48:16.480 --> 48:17.120]  Open laptop.
[48:18.180 --> 48:18.820]  Closed laptop.
[48:19.420 --> 48:20.560]  Why can't I see the keys?
[48:20.700 --> 48:21.800]  You got keys on the top of your lid?
[48:21.840 --> 48:22.760]  No, no, no, no, no.
[48:22.940 --> 48:23.940]  We've been over this before.
[48:24.280 --> 48:25.080]  I have two keyboards.
[48:26.640 --> 48:27.460]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:27.520 --> 48:30.120]  So it's on top of your keyboard, but it's not on top of your keyboard.
[48:30.900 --> 48:32.060]  No, it's not on my keyboard.
[48:32.160 --> 48:32.840]  It's on my laptop.
[48:33.040 --> 48:35.400]  My laptop's closed and there's a keyboard on top of it.
[48:35.400 --> 48:35.860]  Okay.
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.060]  So the keyboard is below the laptop.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.240]  In front of it.
[48:42.600 --> 48:43.620]  It's below and in front.
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.180]  And that's how it gets crumbs, that's how it gets crumbs on it, is because I put the plate
[48:48.920 --> 48:54.040]  on the closed laptop lid, and then crummage happens between me...
[48:54.040 --> 48:55.460]  I've got a solution for this, by the way.
[48:55.760 --> 48:56.640]  Yeah, what's the solution?
[48:57.120 --> 48:59.720]  Put the plate literally anywhere else.
[49:00.180 --> 49:00.920]  I can't, no room.
[49:01.420 --> 49:02.240]  Desk is full.
[49:03.220 --> 49:05.220]  Only space I can fit a plate at the moment.
[49:06.840 --> 49:08.640]  It's like living in an airstream.
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.660]  That, you know, pivots to something else I could do after this we'll talk about.
[49:13.800 --> 49:20.300]  But first, I'm gonna have a bite of this delicious, cold, open-faced...
[49:20.300 --> 49:21.560]  I wonder if he'll hear the crunch.
[49:22.580 --> 49:23.880]  I don't, I'll try.
[49:24.540 --> 49:25.200]  He says cold?
[49:25.740 --> 49:26.100]  Uh-huh.
[49:29.260 --> 49:30.880]  It's not very crunchy.
[49:31.740 --> 49:33.180]  It's not very cloisty.
[49:34.460 --> 49:35.660]  Yeah, he definitely said cloisty.
[49:36.360 --> 49:38.540]  I feel like cold would not be the way to do it.
[49:39.000 --> 49:39.180]  Nah.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.680]  Like, cold mashed potatoes aren't...
[49:42.120 --> 49:48.960]  Would you heat up each element individually, or do you think that now that you've put the $5 bill on it, you just toss that in the microwave and get it going is one thing?
[49:49.400 --> 49:52.540]  Yeah, the $5 bill keeps it from making a mess.
[49:54.920 --> 49:57.380]  It kind of operates like a steam blanket.
[49:57.840 --> 49:58.100]  Yeah.
[50:00.900 --> 50:02.940]  He's so silent. Did you choke and die?
[50:03.760 --> 50:05.100]  I'm just, I'm eating it.
[50:05.260 --> 50:06.900]  Canadian money is plastic, right?
[50:07.280 --> 50:07.400]  Yeah.
[50:08.180 --> 50:10.860]  You know what? It's actually pretty good.
[50:11.540 --> 50:18.660]  I wouldn't order that, but the hash creates a little bit of a fun texture with the mash.
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.760]  And the bread surprisingly combines both things very well.
[50:24.700 --> 50:25.560]  That was pretty good.
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.760]  As I said, I would not expect an open-faced mash hash cash sandwich to be on a menu.
[50:32.140 --> 50:34.520]  And I don't think I'd order it twice if it was.
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.480]  But I'm excited to see your guys' results with this, because I think it was pretty good.
[50:41.140 --> 50:48.260]  I thought that we were one and done with the cookbook, but it's pretty clear to me that we're going to have to make a second one, because we keep coming up with recipes.
[50:50.480 --> 50:51.480]  Yeah, that was good.
[50:52.100 --> 50:54.960]  I'm excited to see what you guys try to do with this sandwich setup.
[50:54.960 --> 50:57.800]  So what do I need to prepare for potatoes?
[50:58.240 --> 51:00.060]  That's a good question, Gavin. What do you expect?
[51:00.400 --> 51:09.560]  Well, what I originally wanted was to spread the mash on toast, and then put the little crispy onion sprinkles with a bit of black pepper.
[51:10.240 --> 51:16.240]  Because in my head, it can just stay pasted to the bread. If you tip the bread upside down, it would all still be on there.
[51:16.860 --> 51:22.100]  And the crispy onion sprinkles are just like the ones you have at Thanksgiving, right?
[51:22.660 --> 51:23.240]  That's what you're talking about?
[51:23.860 --> 51:25.660]  We can make that work, for sure.
[51:25.680 --> 51:29.260]  Yeah, I think it's like the French's onion crispy things.
[51:29.680 --> 51:30.280]  Right, okay.
[51:30.820 --> 51:35.280]  Speaking of things that we need to clean up, Eric, I'm sending you a Slack right now.
[51:35.620 --> 51:36.000]  Okay.
[51:36.180 --> 51:41.240]  We're getting into something serious that we've been putting off for a while, but I believe we're all ready to talk about it now.
[51:42.760 --> 51:43.900]  We did puzzles.
[51:45.100 --> 51:46.520]  We had a puzzle competition.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.020]  Did we turn times in?
[51:48.240 --> 51:49.700]  I don't think we have times from everyone.
[51:49.840 --> 51:52.760]  Gavin said he was done, and he had a time to submit.
[51:52.760 --> 51:54.000]  Is that incorrect?
[51:55.460 --> 51:56.980]  Should I have submitted it already?
[51:57.180 --> 51:57.440]  Okay.
[51:58.380 --> 52:01.380]  Just submit it to Eric via Slack right now.
[52:01.540 --> 52:03.120]  Do you have a time that you can submit?
[52:03.880 --> 52:06.000]  It's been so long, I don't remember my time.
[52:06.240 --> 52:07.520]  I need a picture as well.
[52:07.920 --> 52:08.280]  Okay.
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.480]  What do you mean that you need a picture?
[52:10.480 --> 52:11.940]  I'm gonna send Eric my time.
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.960]  Now, here's, I think, the issue. I have to find where Geoff put his time.
[52:17.540 --> 52:19.820]  Which would have been fucking three months ago.
[52:20.140 --> 52:20.920]  Yeah, don't, yeah.
[52:20.920 --> 52:21.520]  All right.
[52:22.640 --> 52:23.900]  Where do you want this, Eric, on Slack?
[52:24.260 --> 52:25.440]  You can Slack it to me, it's fine.
[52:25.920 --> 52:33.280]  Now, Gavin seemed worried that he had some issue with his, and that made me feel a lot better about mine,
[52:33.340 --> 52:35.820]  because I definitely had some issues that we will get into.
[52:39.200 --> 52:40.000]  Yeah, there's...
[52:42.180 --> 52:44.060]  I'm, like, mad at you, I think?
[52:44.620 --> 52:45.020]  Oh my god.
[52:45.020 --> 52:45.320]  Which one?
[52:45.600 --> 52:45.900]  Who?
[52:46.160 --> 52:46.840]  Which one?
[52:47.400 --> 52:48.220]  I'm mad at Andrew.
[52:48.800 --> 52:49.200]  Okay.
[52:49.720 --> 52:50.200]  Yeah.
[52:50.920 --> 52:51.940]  We'll get into this.
[52:54.060 --> 52:56.400]  This is not, I'm mad at everyone.
[52:57.100 --> 53:01.420]  Geoff is the only one. Hey, Geoff, I'm just letting you know, you win.
[53:02.500 --> 53:02.960]  Oh, okay.
[53:03.060 --> 53:04.460]  Here's, here's what's going on.
[53:04.920 --> 53:05.660]  Here's what's going on.
[53:05.680 --> 53:06.220]  Didn't even get a drumroll.
[53:06.540 --> 53:10.660]  No. No. This sucks. This sucks.
[53:11.380 --> 53:14.620]  We'll go through each entry and then we can explain.
[53:14.620 --> 53:19.760]  I'm trying to find Geoff's time. It doesn't matter. He wins by default.
[53:20.220 --> 53:23.080]  I just, I think I just posted it in the chat.
[53:23.420 --> 53:28.700]  Oh, there we go. Did a great job. Geoff did a great job. I think that's why I couldn't find it, because it was, uh...
[53:30.000 --> 53:31.160]  Four hours, three minutes.
[53:31.160 --> 53:33.140]  Yeah, four hours, three minutes, 26 seconds.
[53:33.820 --> 53:35.040]  Wow. That's incredible.
[53:35.040 --> 53:35.820]  That's really good, Geoff.
[53:36.120 --> 53:37.360]  That's, that's really good.
[53:37.680 --> 53:38.900]  That puzzle was a motherfucker.
[53:39.300 --> 53:39.560]  It was.
[53:39.960 --> 53:44.200]  It was. And Gavin's time was one hour and five minutes.
[53:45.040 --> 53:45.440]  What?
[53:46.360 --> 53:46.760]  Yep.
[53:50.040 --> 53:52.560]  However, that's the image that Gavin submitted to me.
[53:53.500 --> 54:03.860]  So, that's where I was after an hour and five minutes, paused the timer, had to go out, came back, and the cats had kicked it, kicked the shit out of it.
[54:04.720 --> 54:09.060]  And let's face it, if I was at that point at an hour and five minutes, I would have been like for 24 hours.
[54:09.060 --> 54:09.540]  Yeah.
[54:09.580 --> 54:17.780]  I hate that puzzle so much. The entire rim is green and trees. You don't know what you're working on. It's bullshit.
[54:19.340 --> 54:21.960]  I hated it. It was the worst hour.
[54:22.320 --> 54:27.840]  That might be the least impressive amount of work in an hour I've ever seen.
[54:27.940 --> 54:28.620]  Oh, interesting.
[54:28.780 --> 54:34.160]  And that was, that was entirely focused only on the puzzle for an hour straight, and that's what I got out of it.
[54:34.320 --> 54:34.760]  Uh-huh.
[54:34.860 --> 54:35.060]  Really?
[54:35.880 --> 54:37.680]  Geoff, would you like to see Andrew's puzzle time?
[54:37.680 --> 54:43.020]  Yeah, just for the record, he connected 26 puzzle pieces in an hour and five minutes.
[54:43.280 --> 54:44.060]  I counted.
[54:46.320 --> 54:48.620]  That's about one every three minutes, I guess.
[54:48.920 --> 54:49.180]  Uh-huh.
[54:50.400 --> 54:51.840]  So this is my time, and I'll have a story.
[54:51.840 --> 54:53.340]  And it was all edge pieces. Yeah.
[54:54.060 --> 54:57.120]  And then, um, and then here's Andrew's submitted time.
[54:57.900 --> 55:01.500]  My puzzle time, August 13th, 1140 AM.
[55:02.340 --> 55:05.660]  So I started August 13th, 1140 AM.
[55:05.660 --> 55:07.740]  We've talked about, I don't have a table.
[55:08.420 --> 55:12.480]  And so my plan was to take the things off my desk.
[55:12.880 --> 55:13.560]  Which I did.
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.680]  I removed my whole setup, and it wasn't enough space for the puzzle.
[55:19.340 --> 55:23.340]  I just had a giant pile of pieces.
[55:24.440 --> 55:32.960]  And I spent two hours trying to put it together, and I was struggling because I couldn't see the pieces.
[55:33.400 --> 55:40.800]  I did about as many as Gavin did in two hours, and realized I cannot complete it under these conditions.
[55:41.160 --> 55:42.020]  Why don't you just do it on the floor?
[55:42.460 --> 55:44.080]  Oh, yeah. It worked great for you.
[55:44.380 --> 55:45.160]  That's a great plan.
[55:46.140 --> 55:47.240]  Great suggestion, buddy.
[55:48.500 --> 55:49.280]  Good call.
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.820]  Because I knew if I left it on the floor, it would get fucked up in some way.
[55:54.100 --> 55:56.920]  So I couldn't do that. I just didn't have a surface for it.
[55:57.220 --> 56:02.080]  I could have done it on my bed, I guess, but that also, it just, there was no great outcome for me.
[56:02.480 --> 56:04.440]  How would you do a puzzle on a bed?
[56:04.880 --> 56:10.180]  It was a lot larger area than I had on my desk, and the problem was, I had to pile the pieces.
[56:10.560 --> 56:19.540]  So I had all of the edge pieces, and I had a lot of fun setting that up, but it just, I didn't have the space to follow through on my puzzle.
[56:19.880 --> 56:21.400]  Where's your picture of your progress, though?
[56:21.800 --> 56:27.160]  I didn't take a photo of the progress, because there was no, it didn't even occur to me to take, it was so pitiful.
[56:27.160 --> 56:35.840]  Like, I would look at what you did, and it would never consider, like, I wouldn't consider taking a photo, because I knew Geoff would have aced this thing.
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.640]  Can I admit something, though? I didn't know I was even a part of this puzzle thing until one arrived. I thought that was just you and Geoff doing it.
[56:42.900 --> 56:44.880]  No, that was absolutely all of us.
[56:45.060 --> 56:45.360]  Yeah.
[56:46.260 --> 56:47.040]  From the beginning.
[56:47.060 --> 56:48.220]  So Nick and Eric did it?
[56:48.540 --> 56:49.900]  No, it was the three of you.
[56:50.460 --> 56:52.600]  It was pretty clearly covered, I feel like.
[56:52.600 --> 57:01.620]  I felt like it was also pretty clearly covered, and I completely, hand up, I salad-creamed mine. 100%. Absolutely fucked it.
[57:02.020 --> 57:07.460]  I would love, I will do this puzzle when I have the space to do it, there will be an update on that.
[57:07.860 --> 57:13.420]  I haven't had a table in this place for three years, so it might, you know, I don't know, one that will happen.
[57:14.420 --> 57:23.240]  But, I had a lot of fun doing it, and Geoff, I am genuinely, incredibly impressed, because even with a full table, I don't think my time would come close to yours.
[57:23.980 --> 57:26.360]  Your puzzle skills shined.
[57:26.660 --> 57:31.360]  Oh, well that's very kind of you. As the only one who competed, I feel pretty good about myself.
[57:31.560 --> 57:32.140]  Yeah, no kidding.
[57:32.700 --> 57:40.860]  I'd love to do this again someday, maybe when we're all in different places in our lives and can accommodate the space of a 500-piece puzzle.
[57:41.080 --> 57:42.680]  1000-piece. It was a 1000-piece puzzle.
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.140]  That was a 500-piece puzzle, and that's why I picked it.
[57:47.540 --> 57:49.880]  Yeah, we can dumb it down a little bit if you guys need.
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.020]  We can go to 7. I mean, if 7 works a little bit better for you guys.
[57:53.360 --> 58:01.280]  I was very unhappy with my time. Took about an hour longer than I thought. I would like to do it again someday with a different puzzle.
[58:01.760 --> 58:03.780]  Where did you struggle? Was it all the trees and the top?
[58:04.300 --> 58:06.140]  The trees and the leaves.
[58:06.600 --> 58:08.020]  I thought it was such a nightmare.
[58:08.020 --> 58:12.740]  The way to tackle that puzzle is you do the border real fast. You knock it out. That's not hard.
[58:13.060 --> 58:16.880]  Then you pull all the fur out to the side and deal with the bears later.
[58:17.020 --> 58:21.760]  The easiest thing to tackle then is the sky. So you do the sun, all the red and the orange.
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.280]  Once that's done, you don't have much room for the blue, so you fill the blue in, and then it gets hard.
[58:27.480 --> 58:30.060]  Then you gotta work the trees out, and that's where it gets real sucky.
[58:30.260 --> 58:37.140]  I'm such a big fan of you saying that you just knock out the border real quick, and I just scrolled back up to look at Gavin's picture.
[58:38.240 --> 58:42.540]  I could not figure out which tree was on which side. I could not figure it out.
[58:42.640 --> 58:46.040]  Gavin, you certainly have a table. Why did you choose to make it on the floor?
[58:47.020 --> 58:52.660]  That's always where I've done puzzles. I don't think I've ever done a puzzle on a table.
[58:53.420 --> 58:53.620]  What?
[58:54.540 --> 58:57.340]  It's a weird choice.
[58:58.320 --> 59:01.100]  Is it? I thought the floor was the go-to place to do it.
[59:01.240 --> 59:01.400]  No.
[59:02.100 --> 59:03.060]  For a kid.
[59:03.120 --> 59:03.840]  Easy to kick.
[59:03.840 --> 59:07.220]  I mean, Geoff, you're the puzzle professional here. What do you think?
[59:07.680 --> 59:11.740]  I always do it on a table. Yeah, I've always done it on a table.
[59:12.220 --> 59:18.100]  I did that one on my kitchen counter, which is why I had to do it in one sitting, so I just sat down and did it.
[59:18.540 --> 59:27.980]  Yeah, that was my plan. I have very fond memories of going to my grandparents' house, and they would have a table with a puzzle on it, and you could just work away when you felt like it.
[59:28.180 --> 59:32.960]  I don't know that I've ever done a puzzle in one sitting like that before. That was interesting.
[59:32.960 --> 59:38.640]  Because, you know, for me, it's like a stress reliever thing, like you're describing with your grandparents, so I do it like an hour a day or a half hour a day.
[59:39.260 --> 59:41.260]  It was fun to do it that focused.
[59:41.740 --> 59:43.260]  So it was a pleasant four hours?
[59:44.220 --> 59:45.360]  It flew by.
[59:45.620 --> 59:48.140]  Did you have anything on listening to or like watching TV or something?
[59:48.380 --> 59:51.980]  Yeah, I was listening to podcasts. I think I was probably listening to like Bill Simmons or something.
[59:52.460 --> 59:56.920]  Where did you go? Like, what did you have to do, Gavin, that interrupted you from the puzzle?
[59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.260]  Oh, I don't remember. It's like two months ago. I had to go out.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:07.100]  I just I don't know why, like if you had to leave in an hour, I don't know why you'd start a floor puzzle.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.080]  Yeah, I didn't know how long it would take. I thought you'd do it in less than an hour.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:19.760]  I definitely got to say, as a person who owns a lot of cats and has owned them for a while, a floor anything seems like an odd choice.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:28.380]  I think this might be the first puzzle I've done in 20 years. I think I just...
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:28.540]  Okay.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.140]  I don't think I ever got good at them.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.260]  You're just overconfident.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.200]  Done is a strong word. You and I did not do a puzzle.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:41.020]  Well, I mean, as far as I know, you could have just written the date. You didn't even put any time in.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.600]  There's no evidence that you did anything apart from write the date down.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.740]  Okay, you're right. Give me... I'll take 15 minutes and I'll throw the pieces on the floor and combine 26 pieces.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.080]  All right. Okay, genius. Genius. Put together the bottom row in 15 minutes.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.000]  Let me get the pieces out.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.660]  There's no winning, though. Like, I don't know. Like, even if I do that, 15 pieces.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.700]  What's the bottom row? Listen, we both fucked this up tremendously.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:23.760]  I was so worried about mine, knowing I had fucked mine up. And then when you expressed doubt about submitting stuff and concern, I felt so much better.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.240]  Well, I want to go back to the original episode and see if I was ever a part of this.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:28.760]  Yep.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.220]  Well, it's available online for free, so you can do that whenever you choose to.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.100]  And as the person who typically proofs them, you should be the most aware.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.260]  Well, not if it was never said.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:52.060]  Listen, I can't wait to record episode... what is this, 21? I can't wait to record episode 22 for Gavin to go, uh...
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.020]  I got a clip.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:53.840]  I've got a clip.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.560]  I have a clip of me.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.380]  You better have a goddamn clip. Either way.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.100]  He's only going to have a clip if it exonerates him.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.300]  No, I've had clips against me before.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:02.920]  Okay.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.660]  Oh yeah, that's true.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.500]  Fair enough.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.160]  It was...
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:07.960]  We can all be taken down.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:17.340]  It was back in June, the end... June... let's see, let's see what episode this was. I'm trying to narrow in on it.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.300]  Uh...
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.000]  Geoff shared puzzles, and we talked about puzzles for a while.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.240]  I really, like, the reason I bought and sent you a puzzle is because you were part of it.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.580]  So, I don't know, man. I don't know what to tell you.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.640]  What episode was it? I'm going to listen to it.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.600]  That's what I'm looking at right now.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.060]  To see if there's a... it might be 8.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.840]  Potentially could be 8.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.340]  That was 500 pieces.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:43.900]  Yeah.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.580]  A thousand piece puzzle would have been a fucking nightmare to do in one sitting.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:55.760]  For the record, by the way, this went almost exactly as I expected it to go.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.980]  I was on... I was furious.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.720]  What? Why?
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.900]  I started it quite excited, and I can't believe how livid I was after about half an hour.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.080]  I also was very excited.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.740]  Why didn't you just let Meg help you? She wanted to put together the puzzle so bad.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.080]  Oh, she did the puzzle. She did it...
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.480]  She had it finished less than a week later, she'd already done it.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.100]  Did she do it on a table?
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:20.120]  Yeah.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.000]  Oh my god.
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:32.760]  I was trying to find the puzzle. I was like, where did I... where did I put it?
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:39.980]  And then I remembered, oh, it's actually... I remember how I had the Norm DVD supporting the laptop, and I swapped it.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.160]  And the number was under my nose the entire time. It's just right there.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:51.020]  Don't stop. You have to stop showing Gavin your keyboard. He's gonna go insane. He's gonna get so mad.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.160]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.180]  That is the honey mustard remnants that I told you about.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:57.620]  Yeah.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.040]  I spilled it. Little honey mustard remnants.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:11.020]  Can I tell you guys, I gave myself a good old-fashioned f*** face the other day.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:11.580]  Yeah, you did.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.060]  Yesterday.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:12.880]  What did you do?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.900]  I feel like I should share it. I told them last night, Andrew, but you haven't heard it yet.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:27.740]  So yesterday morning, Nick posted to the group a list of about 20 episodes of f*** face that he needed clean audio from.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:40.200]  The reason being, we're going back and we're making best-ofs and compilations and stuff, and we're doing a compilation of different periods of the show, and we need to strip out the licensed music.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:49.040]  The old intro to the show, because we no longer... I guess we can keep the old episodes up that already have it, that we're paid for, but we can't reuse it, right?
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.600]  I just thought we couldn't use it for this.
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:51.980]  Or for this, right?
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.520]  But the old thing is the old thing.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:05:00.800]  The old thing is the old thing where we had the rights for it, but if we re-upload now, we don't have...
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.180]  It's still the old thing.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.100]  I don't know.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.660]  I actually like stripping it out for the purposes of what we're doing here. I think it makes it cleaner.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:16.960]  I don't know. I'll say, yeah, man, go ahead and just put it up with the music, and then we just deal with the consequences, I guess. I mean, I'm not the arbiter of this.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.520]  Well, listen, I already f***ed myself, so there's no reason to do all that.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.260]  So anyway, he posted a list of like 20 episodes. The first one was episode four.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.980]  It went up into the 50s, right? And he said, like, I just need everybody's audio from these episodes.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.520]  And I thought, I'm gonna f***ing... I'm gung-ho about this.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:44.140]  Anytime Nick needs anything, I feel like Nick does a lot of work for regulation that requires other people to send stuff to him.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.140]  And I never want to be the hold-up for Nick to get shit done.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.700]  And so I always try to get it done immediately.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.820]  And so I sat down to find those episodes, and then I realized a couple of things all at once.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:59.680]  One, my favorite thing to do at Rooster Teeth was to mislabel every file I ever created.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.440]  I started doing that to Bernie, like around season two of Red vs. Blue.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:07.300]  And then I did it to Jack for years at Achievement Hunter and the editors.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:13.020]  And then I did it to regulation, to Nick and the editors of f***face and regulation.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:22.260]  And what I have is 205 episodes of f***face that are labeled things like sonicsnutsack.wav
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.800]  or jeffanderickandgavandandrewandnicktalkaboutsomething.wav or...
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.260]  I'll go and put my folder up. Mine's like, you know, f***face193.gav.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:39.040]  And I'll already see a file in there called like thursdaymouthsounds.wav.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.080]  Words with my face.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.280]  Yeah, a lot of that stuff. And so that makes it real hard.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.980]  The other thing that really f***s you is pleasantriesareamotherf***er
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:57.680]  because the episode starts somewhere between like 90 seconds and 18 minutes into the recording.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.020]  And you're only getting your feed.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:08.200]  So you're listening to a third or a quarter of conversations trying to figure out where the goddamn episode is going to start.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:15.340]  And then we didn't label the episodes with numbers on the f***ing podcast apps for the first like 65 episodes.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.900]  So those are no help.
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:21.720]  So you're like just trying to pick a... it f***ing hurts so bad.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.140]  And then another thing that we did that really sucks is we just wouldn't do intros, right?
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.720]  So then even if you find the f***ing intro of the episode, you don't say what episode number it is.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.100]  Sometimes we'd say it at the end.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:38.300]  And so finding 20 distinct episodes where I mislabeled them.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.900]  We don't talk about it for the first nine minutes.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.680]  When we do talk about it, we refuse to say what episode number it is.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.460]  And then we don't publish the episode number when we put it online.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.100]  Made it almost f***ing impossible for me to help Nick out.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.900]  But I did it. It took two and a half hours to find 20 f***ing episodes.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.180]  And I wanted to pull my f***ing hair out by the end of it.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:04.320]  I karmically f***ing faced myself so hard for 22 years of being a dickhead with file naming.
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:09.740]  And I just want everybody that I have wronged in the past through that to know it got me.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.340]  It got me hard yesterday.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.540]  Can I tell you what I would have done?
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:14.320]  Yeah.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.380]  I would have looked at the date that the folder was created and then looked at the date on my file.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.820]  The date the folder was created was just like an empty folder that didn't have anything in it.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.600]  It was like created the day, like yesterday.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.420]  The Google Drive folder?
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.260]  Where I was uploading stuff, yeah.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.460]  Yeah, those are new.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.480]  Those are new.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.360]  But you could just type in, you could just go to the folder of f***face 103 or something and it'll tell you the date.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.400]  Do we have access to those old Google Drives?
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:40.860]  I don't think so.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.640]  I don't think we do.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.520]  I do.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:43.440]  Don't you?
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.160]  No.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.420]  No? You linked me that whole thing?
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.460]  Yeah, can you send that to Nick?
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:48.180]  Yeah.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:58.940]  Just as an example of what Geoff's talking about, this is a random episode of the f***face podcast and his audio is uploaded as whofuckingknows.wave.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.300]  Yeah.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.680]  The only person who never uploaded to these was Nick.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:12.400]  Do you have them and not upload them so you're the only person on Earth who can actually recreate an episode of f***face in its pure form?
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.320]  I am so important right now.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.500]  Well, you also didn't know about these folders.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:27.380]  Well, anyway, anything you can do to make Nick's life easier. It comes too late to help me in any way whatsoever, but that's fine.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.080]  The universe got its pound of flesh yesterday.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:37.920]  Do you have any favorite filenames, Geoff, or is it just like, you do the joke and it's gone?
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:48.920]  Yeah, usually the joke is only for me that makes sense to something that happened to me 15 minutes to an hour earlier and I forget it one second after I make it to myself.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.560]  Yeah, it's not, I don't, it doesn't stick with me.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.460]  Like, I don't look, they don't look like anything to me. I don't know what they mean when I look back on them.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:05.360]  Somebody brought up, I saw a post of my desktop with things that I apparently have an audacity file called commercial takes. Is that AUP?
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.200]  Oh, that's the one you were talking about.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:15.040]  I wonder if that's the like 25 minutes of me just doing different takes. And if so, you should probably release that.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.820]  If so, we should release that.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:23.060]  Because that commercial never came out. I never, I never learned which take they would have went with.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.600]  Yep. Oh man. Well, we should wrap this episode up.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:27.780]  We should.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:33.240]  And we should look at that commercial takes thing because boy, that could be some good supplemental content of just noises.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.180]  As we wrap this up, let me leave you guys with a thought for some potential supplemental content that I don't think we should make.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.520]  You guys have heard of time capsules, right?
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:43.380]  Yep.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:43.980]  Yes.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:52.680]  What if we all made a special kind of time capsule where each one of us went and stole one thing from somewhere in the world and we all put it into a time capsule.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.340]  We call it a crime capsule and then we bury it.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.000]  This is awesome.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.340]  And if anyone finds it, we all go to jail.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.180]  Dude, crime capsule rules.
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.780]  Yeah, those are my notes.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.640]  Oh my God.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.420]  So we just have to make sure the result of a crime is in there.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.440]  Yeah. Yeah. Crime capsule.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:24.400]  Crime capsule is such a funny sketch where it's like, oh, this is, I didn't pay for the movie. Like it's all low stakes thing. And somebody just puts in a bloody knife.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:30.900]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. The escalation, like the heightening for that sketch is so good. That's awesome.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.340]  Oh, that's such a funny premise, Geoff.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.500]  Oh, well, thank you. There you go.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.200]  I love that.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.620]  Let's think about our crime capsules and what we would put in there.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.840]  Wow. I love the crime capsule.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:51.000]  All right. Well, thanks for listening to the podcast. What would you put in your crime capsule? Don't actually do it. And if you do do it, don't credit us with it.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.980]  It was a joke. We're not trying to get anybody killed and put into a capsule.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:05.940]  But you should listen to our podcast. Subscribe to our Patreon if you want to. You can just go to Regulatrion.com or Geoff.Sucks.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:06.420]  I think.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.100]  Because that's probably my name. And we'll see you next week.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.780]  Is putting a swordfish in your ass a crime?
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:13.540]  Okay.
