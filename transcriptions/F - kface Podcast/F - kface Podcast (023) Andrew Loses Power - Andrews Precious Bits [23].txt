[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  Crystal clear waters, white sandy beaches.
[00:03.380 --> 00:05.300]  Stress doesn't exist here, but back home,
[00:05.440 --> 00:08.360]  an undetected water leak can turn into costly water damage.
[00:09.180 --> 00:12.500]  Moen Flow detects leaks and stops your water main automatically,
[00:12.780 --> 00:14.480]  from anywhere, even paradise.
[00:15.880 --> 00:18.500]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:30.490 --> 00:31.970]  This is my desktop.
[00:33.230 --> 00:34.430]  This is just...
[00:34.430 --> 00:35.410]  Oh my god!
[00:35.590 --> 00:36.910]  This is just how I'm living.
[00:37.230 --> 00:38.410]  That's my desktop.
[00:38.610 --> 00:39.490]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[00:41.270 --> 00:42.530]  It's not good.
[00:42.590 --> 00:44.150]  Oh my god!
[00:44.230 --> 00:45.070]  It's real bad.
[00:45.430 --> 00:47.470]  Why does it even do that?
[00:47.950 --> 00:51.770]  Why does it just go like dot dot dot and stack them?
[00:52.890 --> 00:55.410]  Did you stack them like that or does it...
[00:55.410 --> 00:59.130]  No, no, I don't touch that at all. I just, I don't look at it.
[00:59.330 --> 01:00.850]  But how did it get there?
[01:01.510 --> 01:05.990]  I don't know. I guess I do a lot of like, grabbing photos of like,
[01:06.510 --> 01:07.670]  sports news and stuff.
[01:07.670 --> 01:11.270]  You can set where it puts a screenshot, by the way.
[01:11.430 --> 01:13.510]  You don't have to send them to the desktop.
[01:14.330 --> 01:17.870]  I didn't know. I just screen grab them and then I just go on with my life.
[01:17.970 --> 01:19.770]  I don't put much thought into the process.
[01:19.930 --> 01:23.810]  But I recently saw that for the first time in a while.
[01:23.910 --> 01:26.370]  I was like, oh my god, this is not good.
[01:28.010 --> 01:30.550]  That's absurd. I've never seen anything like it.
[01:30.990 --> 01:33.830]  I just, I never navigate. I don't see that screen.
[01:33.830 --> 01:37.370]  I always have my browser open. And if I want to file, I go to find it.
[01:38.010 --> 01:39.250]  I never interact with this.
[01:39.810 --> 01:41.270]  And I never delete anything.
[01:41.570 --> 01:46.150]  If I, there are definite, like, some things that are like seven or eight of the same thing.
[01:46.230 --> 01:47.390]  Because I just don't.
[01:47.610 --> 01:49.310]  One of them's just a picture of donuts.
[01:50.910 --> 01:52.690]  Yeah, there's a donut conversation.
[01:54.770 --> 01:55.430]  Donut talk.
[01:55.870 --> 01:56.770]  That's my desktop.
[01:57.830 --> 01:58.510]  How are you two doing?
[01:59.590 --> 02:00.550]  I'm pretty good.
[02:00.650 --> 02:01.630]  I think we're in. I'm recording.
[02:01.850 --> 02:02.510]  I think I'm recording.
[02:02.530 --> 02:03.070]  I hope so.
[02:03.670 --> 02:08.670]  That screen, we have to put a screenshot of that in the fucking episode for sure.
[02:08.670 --> 02:10.910]  Well, no, we can't put that in. It's like personal stuff there.
[02:11.330 --> 02:11.610]  Yeah.
[02:12.810 --> 02:17.850]  Like, one of the screenshots just says $3,420. Who knows what that could be about?
[02:17.970 --> 02:18.330]  Really?
[02:19.390 --> 02:20.610]  Well, I don't even know.
[02:20.890 --> 02:22.670]  Here's what we need to do. All right, here's what we need to do.
[02:22.710 --> 02:25.970]  We can't show it because it's got too much. It's got Andrew's personal banking.
[02:26.150 --> 02:28.330]  Oh, I'm a fucking idiot.
[02:28.750 --> 02:31.490]  I should have mentioned something last episode.
[02:31.610 --> 02:32.650]  Sorry, go ahead. Continue.
[02:32.650 --> 02:33.390]  You do your thing.
[02:33.950 --> 02:37.390]  I was just going to say we should we should do like the jelly bean game and
[02:37.390 --> 02:40.410]  Gavin and you and I should try to count, make a guess how many
[02:40.410 --> 02:44.110]  how many files are on that desktop and then have Andrew count it up and see who got closest.
[02:44.510 --> 02:45.730]  Yeah, I'll gladly do that.
[02:46.070 --> 02:47.710]  I'll just because it's a relation.
[02:47.790 --> 02:50.490]  When you said that, Gavin, I thought I have no idea what that's about.
[02:51.050 --> 02:52.070]  I do know what that's about.
[02:52.570 --> 02:57.490]  I'm doing a hat raffle right now for one of the original fuck hats,
[02:57.550 --> 03:00.410]  the black fuck hat through the Discord community.
[03:00.410 --> 03:04.450]  And at that point, we had raised $3,420 through it.
[03:04.590 --> 03:05.770]  Oh, shit. That's really cool.
[03:05.950 --> 03:08.410]  Yeah, we're at a little over $4,000 right now.
[03:08.570 --> 03:09.950]  So it's been going really well.
[03:10.090 --> 03:14.350]  So we have an insanely thoughtful and kind community for a show
[03:14.350 --> 03:17.370]  that's called Fuck Face about Geoff shitting himself.
[03:17.870 --> 03:18.790]  It's been really nice.
[03:19.330 --> 03:22.410]  I think there's probably 700 files on your desktop.
[03:23.050 --> 03:23.990]  Also, awesome community.
[03:24.430 --> 03:25.070]  That's my guess.
[03:25.170 --> 03:28.850]  My guess is 776 files.
[03:28.850 --> 03:30.090]  Gavin just brought...
[03:30.090 --> 03:32.130]  Or not Gavin, I am so bad with names today.
[03:32.250 --> 03:33.890]  Eric brought up a great point.
[03:34.490 --> 03:37.930]  There's only fucking four of us and I can't get these names right.
[03:38.410 --> 03:40.750]  Eric brought up a great point that the raffle is over.
[03:40.970 --> 03:42.610]  Long over by the time you're going to hear this.
[03:42.730 --> 03:43.490]  Oh, well...
[03:43.490 --> 03:44.530]  We're way in the future.
[03:44.750 --> 03:46.790]  Have you recorded a bit for a previous episode?
[03:46.890 --> 03:47.850]  We could slop it in.
[03:48.230 --> 03:49.430]  Could I... I couldn't...
[03:50.010 --> 03:51.670]  Could I do that? Would that be possible?
[03:51.930 --> 03:53.150]  I don't know, I feel like you do that a lot.
[03:53.550 --> 03:57.210]  What, like forget to mention a thing that turns out I did actually mention it
[03:57.210 --> 03:58.590]  and it got cut and it's not my fault?
[03:58.590 --> 04:00.510]  I never said anything, is that what you're trying to reference?
[04:00.730 --> 04:05.170]  Before we get to this, what episode of F*** Face is this, Geoff?
[04:05.470 --> 04:05.910]  16.
[04:06.310 --> 04:08.330]  Oh man, that was the wrong person to ask, wasn't it?
[04:08.450 --> 04:09.430]  I don't know why I didn't see that coming.
[04:10.170 --> 04:11.390]  I think it's episode 23.
[04:11.710 --> 04:12.450]  And you are?
[04:12.690 --> 04:13.010]  Geoff.
[04:13.250 --> 04:13.650]  Hey!
[04:14.450 --> 04:15.170]  You're doing an intro?
[04:15.750 --> 04:15.990]  Yeah.
[04:16.070 --> 04:16.690]  I love these.
[04:17.350 --> 04:18.530]  Welcome to F*** Face.
[04:18.990 --> 04:19.790]  Who are you?
[04:20.430 --> 04:21.690]  Andrew, I think.
[04:21.850 --> 04:22.870]  Maybe Gavin?
[04:23.290 --> 04:23.690]  Or Eric?
[04:23.730 --> 04:24.490]  I'm bad with names.
[04:24.850 --> 04:25.550]  Who knows?
[04:25.930 --> 04:27.390]  And I'm Gavin.
[04:27.930 --> 04:28.510]  Guess what?
[04:28.630 --> 04:29.330]  I guess that makes me Andrew.
[04:29.750 --> 04:30.750]  Guess what I just found, Andrew?
[04:31.050 --> 04:31.910]  What did you just find?
[04:32.170 --> 04:36.090]  I was looking through my storage facility for some stuff and I thought,
[04:36.270 --> 04:38.450]  while I'm there, since you and I have been f***ing around with cards,
[04:38.790 --> 04:42.110]  I'll look for all my old good baseball and basketball cards.
[04:42.750 --> 04:47.950]  And I vaguely remembered that somebody came to me and said their kid had started collecting cards
[04:47.950 --> 04:50.750]  and I was feeling very generous and I said,
[04:50.810 --> 04:55.830]  you know what, they can have all my good ones, the ones I used to pay rent with
[04:55.830 --> 04:57.990]  when I was in the army and I was poor, I would sell cards to pay rent.
[04:58.310 --> 04:59.850]  And I still had a ton of really good stuff.
[05:00.050 --> 05:03.250]  And I went today to see if that was a false memory or a real memory.
[05:03.690 --> 05:05.870]  Turns out it was a real, totally real memory.
[05:06.190 --> 05:09.210]  I have no idea who I gave those cards to or whose kid I gave them to,
[05:09.290 --> 05:12.230]  but I gave them so many thousands of dollars worth of cards.
[05:12.910 --> 05:15.270]  But when I was cleaning out some financial stuff,
[05:15.650 --> 05:17.850]  I just found Shaq's rookie card,
[05:18.870 --> 05:21.710]  just f***ing in with some old tax papers.
[05:22.110 --> 05:25.090]  So I found a college Shaq classic rookie card.
[05:25.090 --> 05:26.850]  I looked it up. It's like 700 bucks.
[05:27.070 --> 05:28.910]  Wow. Is it in good condition?
[05:29.470 --> 05:31.150]  Yeah, I'd say it's probably like a nine five.
[05:31.290 --> 05:32.250]  I might get it graded.
[05:32.330 --> 05:33.010]  Are you going to sell it?
[05:33.210 --> 05:34.230]  No, I'll f***ing hold on to it.
[05:34.250 --> 05:34.990]  I love Shaq too much.
[05:35.190 --> 05:35.890]  It's a great character.
[05:36.250 --> 05:37.410]  He's the funniest f***ing dude.
[05:37.690 --> 05:39.930]  Him and Charles Barkley on TNT.
[05:40.530 --> 05:42.850]  They are probably the best panel in sports.
[05:43.110 --> 05:45.570]  Oh yeah, they are the Abbott and Costello of the modern era.
[05:45.930 --> 05:48.170]  Those two, they are phenomenal together.
[05:48.410 --> 05:51.730]  Hey, so turns out, uh, breaking news.
[05:52.330 --> 05:52.730]  GERPL?
[05:53.070 --> 05:53.990]  What about GERPL?
[05:54.550 --> 05:55.370]  That it's real?
[05:55.630 --> 05:56.130]  That I said it?
[05:56.170 --> 05:57.250]  That it's real? That you said it?
[05:57.330 --> 05:58.610]  And Nick cut it?
[05:58.830 --> 06:00.350]  We got confirmation from Nick.
[06:00.850 --> 06:01.670]  I said it.
[06:02.030 --> 06:06.490]  Well, we got to bring Nick in again to explain himself now that he knows it was there.
[06:06.650 --> 06:07.570]  Nick, hey.
[06:08.370 --> 06:09.310]  Hey, uh oh.
[06:11.690 --> 06:12.570]  What happened?
[06:13.670 --> 06:18.130]  Apparently, uh, there's an end bit where Geoff is starting to wrap up and say,
[06:18.210 --> 06:19.770]  cut out anything that I said that was stupid.
[06:20.010 --> 06:23.250]  And as you said that, underneath, Andrew was saying,
[06:23.250 --> 06:24.910]  GERPL, GERPL, GERPL.
[06:24.970 --> 06:26.510]  He was doing a bunch of different lines.
[06:27.450 --> 06:30.490]  And I apparently just lowered the track for it.
[06:30.570 --> 06:32.570]  I was like, oh, we'll let Geoff shine here, I guess.
[06:34.070 --> 06:35.670]  I mean, that's always fair.
[06:36.270 --> 06:40.290]  I just assume that when you heard Geoff say, cut anything stupid,
[06:40.450 --> 06:43.210]  you just immediately went to me and just removed everything I said.
[06:43.750 --> 06:47.270]  There's probably no thought into what the actual content was.
[06:47.390 --> 06:48.370]  So it's really my fault.
[06:48.610 --> 06:51.730]  Is that where you got the idea that Andrew had told you to cut something,
[06:51.730 --> 06:54.190]  but it was actually Geoff telling you to cut stupid?
[06:54.610 --> 06:56.510]  They both told me to cut something.
[06:56.830 --> 06:58.550]  Andrew asked me to cut something else,
[06:58.890 --> 07:02.990]  but I had just assumed that that apparently entailed that as well.
[07:03.090 --> 07:03.590]  It did not.
[07:03.990 --> 07:07.250]  So that was your pyramid scheme or whatever that you wanted to cut?
[07:07.530 --> 07:07.870]  Yeah.
[07:08.290 --> 07:09.090]  That you don't want to talk about?
[07:09.490 --> 07:11.270]  No, I'll talk about the pyramid scheme.
[07:11.530 --> 07:14.090]  I just did a horrible job explaining it in that context.
[07:14.330 --> 07:16.870]  So you were trying to distract us from your Garfield times by
[07:16.870 --> 07:19.530]  just changing the subject to a pyramid scheme.
[07:19.530 --> 07:21.850]  But I guess it worked too well?
[07:22.250 --> 07:23.550]  It did. I guess it was effective.
[07:23.690 --> 07:26.730]  Yeah, I didn't actually plan on telling the story in that moment.
[07:26.910 --> 07:30.730]  It was just supposed to confuse and then we would pivot away to something else.
[07:30.930 --> 07:32.990]  Geoff and I went all in on the pyramid scheme.
[07:33.110 --> 07:34.190]  We were like, oh, what have you got?
[07:34.290 --> 07:39.410]  I got the impression that he really didn't want to go down the Garfield rabbit hole.
[07:39.930 --> 07:41.670]  And so I backed off because I was like,
[07:41.710 --> 07:43.610]  I think he's really upset that he lost those times.
[07:44.170 --> 07:47.810]  And he's like, he's being real nonchalant defeatist about it,
[07:47.810 --> 07:51.330]  which isn't, I think, akin to your typical personality.
[07:51.630 --> 07:54.170]  So I was like, Andrew must not be having a...
[07:54.170 --> 07:57.930]  I'll just back off and we'll just go down the pyramid scheme rabbit hole instead.
[07:58.270 --> 08:01.110]  See, at that point, I thought I had Nickelodeon Racers 2 in my pocket
[08:01.110 --> 08:02.170]  and I was ready to go.
[08:02.410 --> 08:04.870]  Little did I know, zero leaderboards.
[08:05.770 --> 08:07.710]  But the pyramid, if we want to get into the pyramid scheme,
[08:08.250 --> 08:11.410]  a friend and I climbed to the top of the pyramid scheme at one point.
[08:11.690 --> 08:13.050]  It turned into a whole contest.
[08:13.510 --> 08:16.790]  I don't know if you ever heard of Staropoly.com?
[08:16.790 --> 08:18.230]  I think that's what it was called.
[08:19.170 --> 08:20.170]  It was this website.
[08:20.610 --> 08:25.290]  Yes. Was it like a like celebrity stock market or something?
[08:25.550 --> 08:27.130]  Yes, that's exactly what it was.
[08:27.210 --> 08:29.510]  It was Kelsey Grammar was like the face of it.
[08:29.730 --> 08:32.530]  And it was this attempt to say, like,
[08:32.750 --> 08:34.930]  celebrities are going to kickstart the economy
[08:34.930 --> 08:37.910]  by making this social networking site
[08:37.910 --> 08:41.190]  where you could also sell products and promote things.
[08:41.390 --> 08:43.950]  It was very odd, like you'd pay for a subscription.
[08:44.310 --> 08:46.410]  And I feel like their big selling point was
[08:46.410 --> 08:48.350]  you could do HD video emails.
[08:48.410 --> 08:49.510]  It was like, they're big.
[08:49.630 --> 08:50.850]  This is going to change everything.
[08:52.390 --> 08:53.650]  He was the face.
[08:54.370 --> 08:57.330]  Corbin Bleu, I want to say, was in this as well.
[08:57.430 --> 09:00.830]  He was like the fourth most popular person from High School Musical.
[09:01.270 --> 09:05.590]  It wasn't like it was Kelsey Grammar, then a bunch of much lower personalities.
[09:06.030 --> 09:06.570]  Oh, good Lord.
[09:06.890 --> 09:11.130]  I think it turned out to be a pyramid scheme slash credit card scam.
[09:11.650 --> 09:13.050]  The entire thing was extremely corrupt.
[09:13.130 --> 09:14.150]  It was just so bizarre.
[09:14.150 --> 09:17.370]  All the messaging and Kelsey Grammar being involved with this.
[09:17.770 --> 09:21.410]  And there were these links that would tell you that he's going to do a conference call
[09:21.410 --> 09:23.690]  to explain the future of product.
[09:24.110 --> 09:26.290]  Just the concept of Kelsey Grammar doing that was absurd.
[09:26.830 --> 09:29.130]  And you couldn't really find where any of this stuff was.
[09:29.130 --> 09:31.570]  It was buried because I don't think really any of it existed.
[09:31.930 --> 09:33.050]  Did he know it was a scam?
[09:33.370 --> 09:37.150]  I think he agreed, from my understanding, he agreed to be a part of it,
[09:37.410 --> 09:40.510]  but not to the extent in which they used his likeness.
[09:40.850 --> 09:42.730]  They made him the star of the website.
[09:42.730 --> 09:45.610]  I think he sued the company that made it.
[09:45.910 --> 09:47.030]  I could be wrong about that, though.
[09:47.070 --> 09:48.150]  This is a long time ago.
[09:48.290 --> 09:50.950]  This was probably around the time he was getting divorced from Camille Grammar
[09:50.950 --> 09:52.170]  and he was looking for extra cash.
[09:52.530 --> 09:55.390]  It was like 2009-ish, I would say.
[09:55.970 --> 09:56.110]  Yeah.
[09:56.230 --> 09:58.090]  So if that lines up, then that makes sense.
[09:58.630 --> 10:04.570]  So the company that made it was called Todd HD, and the website was Staropoly.
[10:05.230 --> 10:09.750]  And I don't remember if they were star points or Todd points,
[10:09.890 --> 10:12.370]  but it essentially had a leaderboard of efficiency.
[10:12.730 --> 10:16.410]  Whoever the top sellers were, you would get on the leaderboard,
[10:16.730 --> 10:18.090]  and you could get to the top of it.
[10:18.210 --> 10:21.210]  And it was based on, I guess, in theory, how profitable you were
[10:21.210 --> 10:24.610]  to try to incentivize people to see what profits they could make.
[10:25.030 --> 10:30.490]  And a friend of mine showed me that there is a way to get 200 of those points a day.
[10:30.970 --> 10:35.870]  And it was by, I don't know if you watched an ad or if you gave them your email address,
[10:35.970 --> 10:39.070]  but you would go through this process and you would click the link
[10:39.070 --> 10:41.010]  and you'd get 200 points when you clicked it.
[10:41.010 --> 10:45.210]  But if you click the thing multiple times, you'd get as many times as you clicked.
[10:45.570 --> 10:48.730]  And you could do this pretty frequently. I don't think it was once a day,
[10:48.790 --> 10:51.430]  because we're doing it multiple times. But you could get 200 points.
[10:51.510 --> 10:55.290]  So it was intended to be a small amount. And the top people had like 700,000.
[10:55.790 --> 10:59.910]  I think Kelsey Grammar was the top of like 750,000 of these Todd points.
[11:00.170 --> 11:03.510]  And so it turned into a competition between a friend and I,
[11:03.850 --> 11:08.110]  where we were just mashing that button as frequently as we could over a week.
[11:08.110 --> 11:11.650]  And we slowly crossed everybody. There's two accounts that...
[11:14.110 --> 11:16.410]  Well, I've lost Andrew. Where did he go?
[11:16.910 --> 11:18.250]  Yeah, he just straight, yeah, it's gone.
[11:18.610 --> 11:19.150]  He's gone.
[11:19.430 --> 11:20.030]  What happened?
[11:20.470 --> 11:21.890]  Maybe Kelsey Grammar came for him.
[11:22.070 --> 11:23.750]  I think his laptop caught up to him.
[11:24.170 --> 11:26.050]  He's gonna be telling the story.
[11:26.290 --> 11:26.530]  Yep.
[11:26.690 --> 11:27.650]  Thinking we're still listening.
[11:27.830 --> 11:29.510]  I bet there's some good stuff going on right now.
[11:29.970 --> 11:32.310]  I bet it's really kicking into overdrive right now.
[11:32.470 --> 11:34.870]  Yep. What do you think Kelsey Grammar's doing at this part?
[11:35.310 --> 11:37.570]  Sounds like he wants to be dethroned by Andrew and friend.
[11:37.570 --> 11:41.410]  Yeah, I think Andrew's about to overtake Kelsey Grammar. Is that what we're headed?
[11:41.550 --> 11:42.290]  Yeah, I think so.
[11:43.210 --> 11:46.590]  Dials! And then he's upset that he doesn't have the most points anymore.
[11:46.930 --> 11:49.750]  When you think of Kelsey Grammar, what's the first thing that comes to mind?
[11:50.690 --> 11:51.890]  Beast from X-Men.
[11:52.470 --> 11:54.130]  That's fair. That's fair. Gavin?
[11:55.310 --> 11:55.750]  Frasier.
[11:56.210 --> 11:58.170]  For me, it's him falling off that stage.
[12:01.470 --> 12:02.950]  God, I forgot about that.
[12:02.950 --> 12:06.730]  I probably watch that video five times a year still.
[12:06.870 --> 12:08.750]  Just every couple months when I need to pick me up.
[12:08.910 --> 12:12.950]  I just watch him go, oh good lord, and fall fucking hard.
[12:13.690 --> 12:17.190]  He fell like six fucking feet in front of kids, too.
[12:17.250 --> 12:18.590]  It was like a Disney World or something.
[12:19.150 --> 12:20.470]  Oh, poor guy.
[12:20.850 --> 12:23.210]  Oh, such a slam, dude.
[12:23.590 --> 12:26.830]  He was an odd choice for Beast. He's a pretty good Beast, though.
[12:26.930 --> 12:29.370]  No, it worked. Beast was supposed to be smart,
[12:29.530 --> 12:31.850]  and the smartest person in television is Frasier.
[12:31.850 --> 12:33.130]  I think ipso facto.
[12:33.870 --> 12:38.410]  I feel like there's no way the guy's ever read a comic book in his life.
[12:38.670 --> 12:41.510]  No, of course not. But the comic book character is a scientist,
[12:41.810 --> 12:43.510]  and he's super, super smart.
[12:44.170 --> 12:46.290]  New Beast is that kid, isn't it, from...
[12:46.290 --> 12:46.730]  Yeah.
[12:47.490 --> 12:48.870]  About a Boy, what was he in?
[12:49.210 --> 12:57.010]  I feel like all of those X-Men movies stopped mattering the second the MCU started.
[12:57.710 --> 13:01.550]  I think they probably stopped mattering before that, but I think you're right.
[13:02.150 --> 13:05.570]  It kind of tracks. Also, those movies are not good.
[13:05.990 --> 13:07.510]  Like, go back and watch any of those movies.
[13:07.790 --> 13:10.350]  Like, you'd be like, oh, X2, the movie's not good.
[13:10.430 --> 13:11.810]  No, no, no, no.
[13:12.090 --> 13:17.350]  And they make so many of them. There's like First Class and Days of Future Present,
[13:17.470 --> 13:19.070]  like all those ones that popped up.
[13:19.430 --> 13:22.430]  I feel like they all existed just to help Logan get made,
[13:22.550 --> 13:25.210]  which was a phenomenal movie, and then we just forget about them.
[13:25.530 --> 13:29.850]  I liked One, Two, and First Class. I think those are my favorite three.
[13:29.850 --> 13:36.030]  I think that they are necessary evils, like the first Spider-Man.
[13:36.450 --> 13:39.550]  Like, they're necessary evils to get us to the point where we are now,
[13:39.650 --> 13:43.790]  where these movies are like, I guess you could say like an elevated place.
[13:44.150 --> 13:47.250]  But man, if you go back and watch those with like, now vision,
[13:48.830 --> 13:53.530]  man, that first Spider-Man movie is like, it's weird.
[13:53.710 --> 13:56.890]  Sam Raimi is such a weird directing choice for that first Spider-Man movie.
[13:56.950 --> 13:57.850]  It doesn't make any sense.
[13:58.090 --> 13:58.870]  Yes, he is.
[13:59.430 --> 14:05.330]  Like, the part at the end where Willem Dafoe just goes like,
[14:05.430 --> 14:08.230]  Godspeed Spider-Man, and then like the thing flies into him,
[14:08.350 --> 14:12.190]  and there's like this weird like jostling camera and like these zooms.
[14:12.410 --> 14:15.670]  It looks like Evil Dead, but it's a movie that came out in like 2000.
[14:15.970 --> 14:18.610]  It's like he didn't learn how to do anything else. It was wacky.
[14:20.130 --> 14:25.150]  Like, it's like if Geoff was doing like his own machinima now and just going like,
[14:25.210 --> 14:27.330]  well, that's my signature. Like, that's all I do.
[14:27.330 --> 14:29.870]  I just do Halo 1 machinima.
[14:30.150 --> 14:32.850]  Yeah, I only do this. That's my thing.
[14:33.190 --> 14:36.230]  It's like, oh, you didn't evolve. You should like keep learning new things.
[14:36.730 --> 14:39.310]  Or unlearning, which would be more the case for me.
[14:39.490 --> 14:41.570]  Now I just have to fucking talk and stare into a microphone.
[14:41.950 --> 14:44.710]  Hey, Geoff, I saw you riding your bicycle the other day.
[14:44.990 --> 14:45.550]  Oh, yeah.
[14:46.130 --> 14:47.050]  Was he pedaling?
[14:47.330 --> 14:47.610]  Did you say hi?
[14:47.610 --> 14:49.530]  So that's what I was going to point out.
[14:50.810 --> 14:52.270]  Gavin, it looks unnatural.
[14:53.190 --> 14:59.790]  When he pedals, you can tell that there's an assist because he's not pedaling hard enough
[14:59.790 --> 15:02.090]  for the bike to be moving as fast as it is.
[15:02.590 --> 15:03.830]  I'm a fucking speed demon, baby.
[15:03.950 --> 15:04.590]  No, you're not.
[15:04.930 --> 15:10.410]  You look like you're on a... like, you pedal like you're on a beach stroll,
[15:10.710 --> 15:13.970]  but you are moving like you are with traffic.
[15:14.450 --> 15:15.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:16.710 --> 15:17.770]  Where was I?
[15:18.350 --> 15:19.530]  Over by Dart Bowl.
[15:19.710 --> 15:27.270]  I was coming back from Twin Liquor and I went like, oh, there's Geoff on his bicycle.
[15:27.590 --> 15:28.650]  But I think he had headphones in.
[15:28.810 --> 15:30.510]  So it was like I was going to beep and do a whole thing.
[15:30.590 --> 15:32.550]  But then I went, I don't I don't care about this that much.
[15:32.750 --> 15:35.270]  I wouldn't hurt you when I have my headphones in.
[15:35.410 --> 15:39.190]  I mean, I have the noise cancelling off so I can hear the world around me.
[15:39.250 --> 15:40.610]  But I was probably in the zone.
[15:40.870 --> 15:42.750]  Does Eric not count as the world around you?
[15:42.910 --> 15:44.630]  Well, yeah, I'm just saying if like somebody was honking,
[15:44.710 --> 15:46.850]  I probably wouldn't have been paying attention to notice it.
[15:46.850 --> 15:47.910]  He would have, you know what I mean?
[15:48.130 --> 15:49.970]  You wouldn't have been paying attention if someone honked at you?
[15:50.270 --> 15:52.170]  Not if you were being, I don't know.
[15:52.370 --> 15:54.210]  I'll tell you what, next time honking me, we'll see if I see it.
[15:54.490 --> 15:54.750]  Okay.
[15:55.330 --> 15:57.910]  I'll tell you what, I'll go ride by Dart Bowl later this week.
[15:58.750 --> 16:00.610]  I'll just keep circling around Dart Bowl.
[16:00.970 --> 16:01.850]  We'll see what's going on.
[16:02.110 --> 16:02.690]  It'll be a good time.
[16:03.150 --> 16:07.250]  So what do you think is happening in the Pyramid Skim story now?
[16:08.030 --> 16:09.370]  He said he texted us.
[16:09.410 --> 16:10.510]  He said his power went off.
[16:12.130 --> 16:13.570]  I replied, do you need power?
[16:13.950 --> 16:16.830]  And he said, no, my computer runs on coal.
[16:16.850 --> 16:18.330]  So that was pretty funny.
[16:19.210 --> 16:22.010]  And he's still, he's checking his breaker now.
[16:22.510 --> 16:26.410]  While we're waiting for Andrew, let me pose a business idea to you guys
[16:26.410 --> 16:27.730]  and let me see what you think about it.
[16:27.750 --> 16:28.890]  Do we want to wait for Andrew though?
[16:28.910 --> 16:32.670]  I feel like, I feel like anyone else on this podcast is totally replaceable,
[16:32.990 --> 16:35.390]  but we've lost, like, f***face himself.
[16:35.590 --> 16:37.070]  And that's what I was going to say.
[16:37.170 --> 16:39.210]  Just produce, putting the producer hat on.
[16:40.230 --> 16:44.250]  This could potentially be, if he lost his first part of his recording,
[16:44.250 --> 16:47.250]  could be a real issue for Nick and his recording.
[16:48.150 --> 16:51.230]  This might be a f***faced episode.
[16:51.530 --> 16:53.510]  And this might be a lost episode of f***face.
[16:53.990 --> 16:54.730]  I'm just saying.
[16:54.950 --> 16:56.030]  This is so funny.
[16:56.290 --> 16:57.110]  I'm just saying.
[16:57.450 --> 17:00.070]  I hope, I hope to God that that's not the case.
[17:00.250 --> 17:02.030]  I, you know, I hope, I hope so too.
[17:02.370 --> 17:03.290]  Is he recording?
[17:03.450 --> 17:04.690]  What does he use to record, Audacity?
[17:05.410 --> 17:06.750]  I think so.
[17:06.870 --> 17:09.810]  Either that or it's like a phonograph that takes an hour and a half to export.
[17:10.090 --> 17:12.110]  I don't remember what it was.
[17:12.110 --> 17:14.550]  It's transcribing it into a record.
[17:16.170 --> 17:18.710]  It's like, it's like cutting, cutting lines in wax.
[17:19.250 --> 17:20.330]  Oh, Andrew's got an update.
[17:20.690 --> 17:21.350]  This is troubling.
[17:21.770 --> 17:22.470]  He says...
[17:22.470 --> 17:23.630]  Nope, not breaker specific.
[17:23.830 --> 17:24.870]  I have no power.
[17:25.050 --> 17:27.950]  I heard a boom and then everything went out.
[17:28.490 --> 17:30.770]  I guess we might be done here.
[17:31.050 --> 17:32.930]  Yeah, I think this might be a lost episode, guys.
[17:34.470 --> 17:40.650]  Well, if, if Nick, if you can salvage it or if Andrew's able to save that file,
[17:40.650 --> 17:42.870]  it would be fun to have this as a throwaway extra.
[17:43.250 --> 17:45.590]  And I need to, I need to, we need to record another episode
[17:45.590 --> 17:48.010]  because I gotta get this fucking business idea out.
[17:49.590 --> 17:50.310]  It's brilliant.
[17:50.530 --> 17:52.110]  I mean, we can try on a different day.
[17:52.190 --> 17:52.990]  Why can't we do Thursday?
[17:53.090 --> 17:54.530]  You got like another tooth thing or something?
[17:54.970 --> 17:56.310]  Uh, why can't I do Thursday?
[17:56.930 --> 17:57.870]  You don't even know?
[17:58.370 --> 17:59.310]  Hold on, I gotta look at my calendar.
[17:59.790 --> 18:00.950]  Did I say I couldn't do Thursday?
[18:02.090 --> 18:03.690]  Yeah, that's why we're doing it today.
[18:03.770 --> 18:04.970]  That's why we're doing it on Tuesday.
[18:05.210 --> 18:05.830]  Is this real?
[18:06.170 --> 18:08.510]  Why the fuck did I ask us to move Thursday?
[18:08.850 --> 18:09.570]  I thought you did.
[18:09.630 --> 18:10.130]  Did you not?
[18:10.650 --> 18:11.330]  No, I did.
[18:11.710 --> 18:12.530]  I said, I did, I did.
[18:12.610 --> 18:15.650]  I said, hey, oh, oh, that's right.
[18:15.730 --> 18:20.870]  I'm having some shelves put in in my library and they're gonna be banging and screwing and...
[18:21.510 --> 18:22.690]  You're not putting in your own shelves?
[18:23.270 --> 18:23.930]  Uh, I did.
[18:24.050 --> 18:29.650]  I pulled out the shelves that I put in and having like built-ins put in that are like,
[18:29.950 --> 18:30.870]  that are made for the space.
[18:31.210 --> 18:31.430]  I'll be honest.
[18:31.590 --> 18:33.970]  I don't think I would have moved this podcast for shelves.
[18:35.030 --> 18:36.210]  Well, here's why.
[18:36.350 --> 18:36.750]  Here's why.
[18:36.750 --> 18:37.730]  I got a window.
[18:38.210 --> 18:43.510]  I got a window because then the next week I'm out of town and they couldn't do it any other time.
[18:43.630 --> 18:46.290]  So it was either this Thursday or like a month from now.
[18:46.510 --> 18:47.450]  And you got to get those shelves.
[18:47.970 --> 18:49.410]  They have been designed.
[18:49.670 --> 18:51.270]  It's been a six week process.
[18:52.030 --> 18:52.330]  I got it.
[18:52.650 --> 18:53.450]  I gotta get past it.
[18:53.770 --> 18:55.110]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:55.210 --> 18:57.370]  And here's, here's why it's, here's why it's important.
[18:57.610 --> 18:58.230]  Here's why it's important.
[18:58.450 --> 19:03.710]  Because when they put in the built-in shelves, they're putting in a, they're building a built-in
[19:03.710 --> 19:09.830]  desk for me as well that will allow me to, uh, open up my, my, uh, my setup a little bit
[19:09.830 --> 19:12.710]  and will allow me not to, uh, not to be so cramped.
[19:12.850 --> 19:15.510]  And I'll be able to perform better and make better podcasts.
[19:15.590 --> 19:18.290]  That'll also give me the room to put in the new PC and stuff that I'm buying.
[19:18.290 --> 19:20.510]  So it's future-proofing for a f***ing face.
[19:20.690 --> 19:22.230]  You're getting new, hang on.
[19:22.790 --> 19:29.030]  You're getting new shelves and a new desk put in so you can perform better in the show
[19:30.390 --> 19:35.930]  where Andrew is talking about overcoming Kelsey Grammar on a defunct pyramid scheme website.
[19:36.530 --> 19:38.110]  That is correct. Factually correct. Yes.
[19:38.450 --> 19:39.470]  Great. Fantastic.
[19:39.470 --> 19:40.730]  Yeah, I'm still rolling, Nick.
[19:41.050 --> 19:42.390]  Yeah, yeah, we're all still rolling.
[19:42.590 --> 19:43.050]  Yeah, of course.
[19:43.450 --> 19:46.430]  Just like, who knows where this will live? I guess that's why we have the Instagram.
[19:46.590 --> 19:49.810]  You can put this up on like a reel and people can just keep playing it. Who gives a s***?
[19:50.170 --> 19:53.210]  Also, I feel like I never got a chance to mention last episode.
[19:53.290 --> 19:55.110]  God, I really want to talk about my business project.
[19:56.590 --> 20:01.210]  I forgot to mention last episode, or at least I tried to, but I couldn't get a word in.
[20:01.690 --> 20:11.330]  I'm talking to you guys on a fully functioning, totally complete, A-OK, 100% mouth.
[20:11.870 --> 20:11.930]  Nice.
[20:11.930 --> 20:13.370]  Oh, are you all done with teeth?
[20:13.810 --> 20:17.390]  Yesterday, I went in to get my permanent crown put on.
[20:17.710 --> 20:22.770]  It was the final step of the five-trip saga, the three-month saga.
[20:22.770 --> 20:26.490]  And I went in at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, and they said,
[20:26.830 --> 20:28.170]  this should take about 15 minutes.
[20:28.530 --> 20:28.570]  No.
[20:29.110 --> 20:30.930]  We're not even going to have to numb your mouth.
[20:31.250 --> 20:31.610]  No.
[20:31.970 --> 20:37.450]  90 minutes later, I limped out of that chair with a very, very bloody numb mouth.
[20:37.610 --> 20:42.650]  However, it's done. It's done.
[20:43.290 --> 20:45.730]  I f***ing chewed on the left side of my mouth today.
[20:45.950 --> 20:48.770]  Hadn't done that in three months. It was glorious.
[20:49.410 --> 20:49.550]  Wow.
[20:49.550 --> 20:50.690]  It was phenomenal.
[20:51.250 --> 20:53.910]  And I'm done. I'm f***ing done, baby.
[20:54.010 --> 20:57.370]  My mouth's good. I don't have any temporary anything.
[20:57.610 --> 21:03.650]  I got a permanent tooth, and I'm done getting 7,000 needles stuck in it.
[21:03.810 --> 21:09.810]  I'm done having people, like, f***ing working in my mouth like it's a f***ing 68 Buick.
[21:10.190 --> 21:13.550]  I'm totally, totally back in business.
[21:13.870 --> 21:17.610]  Do you think you could tackle a bag of taffy to prove it, or would you be worried?
[21:17.670 --> 21:20.090]  Yeah, that's a good idea. That's a good idea.
[21:20.630 --> 21:22.190]  That's scary. I don't know about that.
[21:22.350 --> 21:23.690]  I don't want to go through this again, man.
[21:24.070 --> 21:28.390]  And they were like, they were like, it was like, I knew what was going to happen before they did.
[21:28.750 --> 21:31.450]  They sat me down. They go, we don't even have to numb you. It's going to be fine.
[21:32.030 --> 21:34.630]  We're just going to pull this out. If you feel, you might feel a little pressure,
[21:34.890 --> 21:36.750]  but it shouldn't hurt. And I go, okay. And she goes,
[21:39.350 --> 21:40.750]  Huh, that doesn't seem to be coming.
[21:41.230 --> 21:43.070]  I mean, let me get the dentist. And the dentist comes in and goes,
[21:44.770 --> 21:45.550]  And she goes,
[21:46.690 --> 21:49.110]  Well, we're going to have to cut the temporary in half.
[21:49.110 --> 21:52.690]  That's okay though. We still don't need to do a pain meds or anything.
[21:52.810 --> 21:55.990]  It should just take a second. And she's in there and they're like cutting and cutting.
[21:56.210 --> 21:58.450]  And then they go, she's in there. And I heard,
[22:00.150 --> 22:03.510]  Didn't feel anything because, you know, it was just the temporary thing that we're cutting.
[22:03.710 --> 22:04.770]  And it goes, and she goes,
[22:06.930 --> 22:10.810]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and get a syringe and we're going to numb you up.
[22:11.330 --> 22:14.610]  And then 10 minutes turned into almost two hours.
[22:15.790 --> 22:18.670]  But I'm done! I'm back in business!
[22:20.270 --> 22:23.250]  Oh, Andrew has pointed out. He's texted me that the, uh,
[22:23.290 --> 22:27.490]  the pyramid scheme was edited out of one episode. It is now interrupted by a power outage.
[22:28.330 --> 22:31.050]  It's just way funnier at this point if you just never tell.
[22:32.550 --> 22:35.390]  This is almost long enough to be a full episode called what happened.
[22:35.550 --> 22:37.590]  I would honestly put it out as a full episode.
[22:37.670 --> 22:40.090]  I just don't want to deprive the audience of an, of a week of Andrew.
[22:40.470 --> 22:41.290]  Yeah, that's right.
[22:41.370 --> 22:42.330]  It should be supplemental.
[22:42.910 --> 22:46.390]  Maybe we should make it a supplemental, like, uh, this is episode 16 and a half or something.
[22:46.390 --> 22:50.410]  Yeah, I mean, we can do that. It's just going to be like, can you, that's going to drive me,
[22:50.450 --> 22:54.510]  that would drive me insane if I was looking at the count. I guess it doesn't matter.
[22:54.710 --> 22:58.170]  It's just like, I look at stuff and like when 22 matches with 22, that feels good.
[22:58.270 --> 23:01.710]  When 22 and it's like number 23, it's like, I'm going to jump out the window.
[23:02.190 --> 23:05.270]  Well, well, look, what can we do to appease you there, Eric?
[23:05.290 --> 23:08.150]  No, you know what? Because it doesn't matter. No, listen, because it doesn't matter because
[23:08.150 --> 23:11.270]  we've uploaded other things on this channel. There's a teaser and like all this other stuff.
[23:11.270 --> 23:14.970]  So really, we got fucked on the number to begin with. So it doesn't matter.
[23:14.970 --> 23:20.150]  We could always just sling this on the end of the episode that we eventually finish.
[23:20.510 --> 23:24.130]  That's a good point. And then just be like, halfway through recording this episode,
[23:24.290 --> 23:26.930]  Andrew just disappeared. We carried on without him.
[23:27.090 --> 23:31.230]  Andrew says, I think we shouldn't even address it in the return. Just a really hard cut.
[23:33.050 --> 23:33.570]  Okay.
[23:36.970 --> 23:43.110]  So Andrew wants it to be, he stops talking and then we just start talking about something else.
[23:44.470 --> 23:49.670]  And we're just, 30 minutes later, he just shows up and finishes his Kelsey Graber story.
[23:52.310 --> 23:57.050]  The worst part about this is he's not going to get his power back anytime soon. I don't think.
[23:58.270 --> 24:03.550]  So we're going to have to wait two weeks before we can get back to it.
[24:03.890 --> 24:07.410]  Yeah, we just do it on Thursday with the banging going on.
[24:07.590 --> 24:10.610]  There's all kinds of shelves and Geoff has to perform better.
[24:10.830 --> 24:12.350]  That's funny. That's still good.
[24:13.110 --> 24:19.030]  I can, uh, no dude, it's going to be like eight dudes in here and it's not a big room.
[24:19.370 --> 24:20.470]  That's really funny.
[24:20.970 --> 24:23.830]  Well, Gavin, do you think it's actually going to be eight dudes?
[24:24.470 --> 24:27.510]  Especially considering the first half of the episode won't have that.
[24:31.090 --> 24:33.730]  And then suddenly the room is full of dudes.
[24:35.430 --> 24:39.090]  All you're going to hear is, all you're going to hear is, dum, dum, dum.
[24:40.930 --> 24:43.590]  It's going to sound like, it's going to sound like me at the dentist.
[24:46.930 --> 24:49.530]  All right, I think we should do it, I think we should go ahead Thursday.
[24:49.770 --> 24:52.450]  It's up, I can put it on the schedule, but it's up to you, Geoff.
[24:52.570 --> 24:55.130]  I don't want, I don't want to make you do anything you don't want to do.
[24:55.230 --> 24:57.350]  I'll tell you what, let's put it up on the schedule.
[24:57.610 --> 25:00.310]  And let's just hope for the best.
[25:00.630 --> 25:01.310]  Oh, Andrew's back.
[25:01.790 --> 25:03.010]  Oh shit! Andrew's is back. Hold on.
[25:03.070 --> 25:03.330]  Where?
[25:03.730 --> 25:04.170]  Hold on.
[25:04.270 --> 25:06.390]  Oh, he might be on his phone or something.
[25:06.650 --> 25:07.610]  All right, let's see, let's see.
[25:07.610 --> 25:11.330]  I see you. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you have to join voice chat.
[25:12.210 --> 25:16.370]  Well, don't tell him audibly. You gotta type it. I was already typing it.
[25:17.510 --> 25:22.010]  Well, in that case, maybe, maybe, maybe we just roll. No, because it's gonna sound,
[25:22.110 --> 25:25.190]  it's gonna sound like dog shit, dude. It's gonna be like him through his phone.
[25:25.630 --> 25:28.290]  This will be funny for like a minute or so.
[25:28.910 --> 25:32.910]  This episode is brought to you by Corona. When you're on a beach with a nice cold
[25:32.910 --> 25:37.430]  Corona in hand, how can you not feel centered? But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?

[29:05.350 --> 29:11.250]  so you're on your phone. I'm on my phone. Yeah. Is your power still out? Yes. When you,
[29:11.470 --> 29:14.750]  when your power, did you get a chance to save your audio before your computer turned off?
[29:15.070 --> 29:20.310]  From the last episode? Well, yeah, obviously, from this one. I exported. I'm pretty sure I
[29:20.310 --> 29:24.850]  saved. I definitely exported. Then, wait, but not from, that was the last one, not from this one.
[29:25.110 --> 29:27.590]  Well, no, not from this one. Why would I answer from this one?
[29:28.830 --> 29:31.950]  How could I save in the middle of a recording? When you're, when you,
[29:36.170 --> 29:40.750]  did you save the project first and then start recording? What are you talking about?
[29:43.030 --> 29:47.530]  We're trying to find out if we can recover your audio when you get your power back or not,
[29:47.530 --> 29:52.010]  so that we can determine if what we've been doing for the last 40 minutes can still be
[29:52.010 --> 29:57.190]  considered content. He's coming so aggressively. I thought something was happening. I thought
[29:57.190 --> 30:01.970]  there was, the show was continuing. I didn't understand the context of the chat. I was
[30:01.970 --> 30:05.450]  surprised people were even here. I just remembered I had a Discord app on my phone. We just kept
[30:05.450 --> 30:09.970]  going. We're not gonna, we're gonna probably cut it from the main episode. But it's very,
[30:10.130 --> 30:14.110]  well, it's funny to me, actually, Nick just said the same thing. He, to me, sounds better than
[30:14.810 --> 30:19.070]  But, but he's not recording, but we don't have a way of recording his individual audio,
[30:19.070 --> 30:22.970]  which is what we use in the edit. It's all going to be the scratch, and it's going to
[30:22.970 --> 30:27.390]  sound like dog shit. Isn't that every other podcast that we make is the scratch? Yeah,
[30:27.450 --> 30:31.830]  this one, this is an audio podcast, so it can sound good. Don't, okay, hang on. Nick's suggestion
[30:31.830 --> 30:37.910]  is insane for this show. Nick, just say we can't do it. What you're doing is not helping.
[30:37.910 --> 30:42.910]  Just don't overtalk each other. That's not going to happen in this show.
[30:43.430 --> 30:48.670]  Well, here's what, here's what could happen. No, here's what could happen. Nick mutes Geoff and me
[30:48.670 --> 30:54.830]  and you, but not Andrew. Well, I can't, there's, there's no way. I've got like 500 megabytes of
[30:54.830 --> 31:03.990]  data. There's no way I could do 40 minutes. Wait, you're on like cellular? Yeah, I'm on a
[31:03.990 --> 31:08.890]  power. How else would I be? You sound so good. I'm still on my phone.
[31:11.230 --> 31:17.750]  You sound as good as normal. You sound better than Geoff. Oh my God. Whatever this is,
[31:17.810 --> 31:22.930]  we're 35 minutes into it, and it's highly entertaining to me. That's what I saw on the
[31:22.930 --> 31:26.810]  thing. I thought, oh, I was looking in the discord, and I remembered I had it, and then I
[31:26.810 --> 31:30.590]  saw all of you still here, which was alarming to me, and I assumed something was happening,
[31:30.590 --> 31:35.430]  so I just wrote, I see you. Now I'm muted. Yeah, I was telling a mouth story about my
[31:35.430 --> 31:40.110]  fucking last trip to the, uh, to the dentist. Yeah, a lot of this recording has been us talking
[31:40.110 --> 31:44.770]  about what we're going to do with this recording, but that's some pretty good stuff, but I feel
[31:44.770 --> 31:48.010]  like we can't put it out as a main episode, because you're not in it. As a main episode,
[31:48.110 --> 31:52.590]  yeah. Yeah, but he's in it now, and he's in it at the beginning, so. I'm okay with it. Okay,
[31:52.910 --> 31:58.430]  I leave this steaming pile of content to Nick and Eric's capable hands to figure out. I mean,
[31:58.430 --> 32:02.670]  Nick said that he's muted everyone but Andrew, so this is bizarre. So potentially,
[32:03.050 --> 32:08.370]  if we're all still recording, and he's recording this with Andrew, you guys could just pick up
[32:08.370 --> 32:11.910]  where we left off. But he doesn't have the megabits on his phone. Oh, that's right. I
[32:11.910 --> 32:14.790]  don't know what I'm thinking. Yeah, you're totally right. He doesn't have the megabits.
[32:15.250 --> 32:22.130]  I don't have the bits. I'm a severe lack of bits right now. Can we just pay for your phone this
[32:22.130 --> 32:31.350]  month? How do we get you more bits? My phone plan goes right through. I don't have a main
[32:31.350 --> 32:37.530]  phone plan, so it'll just charge to my card whatever the overage is. That could be scary.
[32:37.690 --> 32:43.090]  I don't like the idea of just having a faucet of cash that's on that I don't know how much is
[32:43.090 --> 32:47.370]  coming out of. All right, well, this could be the nice ending to this supplemental part where
[32:47.370 --> 32:52.490]  we find Andrew again. Andrew, you missed out. I hope you listened to it. There was some good
[32:52.490 --> 32:55.630]  stuff in there that you missed out on. Andrew, did you realize the only reason we're not doing
[32:55.630 --> 33:01.670]  this on Thursday is because Geoff's having a shelf put up? He said he had a contractor coming
[33:01.670 --> 33:08.190]  over. I assumed it was more than a shelf. It's in the room that I record, and it's not just a shelf.
[33:08.310 --> 33:13.590]  It's also a desk. The desk that I'll be recording on. You can't move. You're on a laptop, right?
[33:13.590 --> 33:18.510]  Isn't the whole point of your computer? No, I'm on an iMac. I'm on an iMac. You can't move an iMac
[33:18.510 --> 33:24.510]  because the screen is part of the fucking computer. It's the most portable. Also, you have a laptop, too.
[33:24.870 --> 33:31.850]  I'm getting lectured by a guy who doesn't have access to electricity or megabytes. That wasn't
[33:31.850 --> 33:36.210]  my fault, okay? I don't have the bytes. I don't have the power, but I have the will and the
[33:36.210 --> 33:41.430]  determination. And if a shelf was coming into my house, I would just move where I record. I would
[33:41.430 --> 33:46.430]  not force a double-edged sword. They're still gonna be hammering and sawing and making noise. I can't
[33:46.430 --> 33:52.010]  promise. I said the same thing, Andrew. I would not have moved. All right, all right, all right.
[33:52.110 --> 33:57.890]  Well, we're gonna record part two or whatever the fuck this is. We're doing it
[33:57.890 --> 34:05.890]  again on Thursday. So, Andrew, if you can, at all possible, get an extension cord and run it
[34:05.890 --> 34:10.570]  down the alley, run it down piss alley to the McDonald's or whatever, and get them to plug it in
[34:10.570 --> 34:15.070]  and then or maybe take up a like if you can go outside and panhandle for some extra megabits
[34:15.070 --> 34:21.130]  just so that you're ready to go. How do I check my bits on my phone? How do I do this?
[34:21.210 --> 34:25.630]  Can I do this live? Can I do a bit check? Because I might be okay. I don't know what the bit ratio is
[34:25.630 --> 34:31.110]  here. I mean, are you asking these other two how to check something on your phone? I'm just kind of
[34:31.110 --> 34:35.190]  asking. I'm gonna click the button on my phone. I don't know if I'm gonna... You still hear me?
[34:35.190 --> 34:42.450]  Yeah, go to general and then... But you don't have an iPhone though.
[34:43.130 --> 34:46.850]  Oh, yeah, I have a completely different phone. I realized it was pointless to ask.
[34:49.330 --> 34:53.450]  I'm on a Google Pixel. If anyone in the comments knows where I can find my bits.
[34:54.190 --> 34:59.770]  What comments? What comments? This is live. What are you talking about? I'm saying when this comes
[34:59.770 --> 35:04.590]  out, Eric, I'm saying if I don't find the bits. This is like never coming out. Like, I don't know
[35:04.590 --> 35:08.650]  could this be? Like, is this an episode? Like, I don't even know what this is. This is definitely
[35:08.650 --> 35:16.470]  an episode. I'm just trying to find my bits. So are we now saying that this is an episode? No.
[35:16.750 --> 35:21.530]  I think this is definitely part of the show. But you weren't in most of it. It's content. I just
[35:21.530 --> 35:26.210]  don't know what to call it. This is definitely content. Well, if this isn't content, why am
[35:26.210 --> 35:30.970]  I wasting my time here on this phone with you? These are precious bits. Here's the deal, Andrew.
[35:30.970 --> 35:34.850]  I said we could make it a supplemental, like this could be episode 16.5 or something,
[35:34.970 --> 35:39.650]  but Eric doesn't like asymmetry. Okay. So he said... I don't give a shit what we do with it.
[35:39.690 --> 35:43.810]  We're doing something with this now. I'm using bits. This is a bit investment. I think this could
[35:43.810 --> 35:47.550]  be... I don't know what it sounds like, but apparently... We should decide now whether we're
[35:47.550 --> 35:52.830]  keeping this as just the episode as it happened or whether we have the first half of the episode
[35:52.830 --> 35:59.310]  that we'll finish on Thursday. I mean, Nick is saying have it be the episode. He made a second
[35:59.310 --> 36:07.110]  account so we can record, but then he could also listen. I'm recording Andrew only on this computer
[36:07.110 --> 36:14.550]  and everyone else on the other one. He has gone through hoops to make this work. I feel like this
[36:14.550 --> 36:18.430]  is definitely part of the episode. I just... We got a bit problem. I need to figure out my bit
[36:18.430 --> 36:23.910]  situation. So Kelsey Grammer... I don't think... I don't really have anything else to say about
[36:23.910 --> 36:30.410]  that and I think... Oh, come on! We lost you mid-sentence. You left us mid-sentence.
[36:30.890 --> 36:36.930]  Well, where did I leave off? I need to... Oh, no! Kelsey Grammer had 700,000
[36:37.770 --> 36:42.510]  Todd points and then you and your friend were getting 200 Todd points every time you... You think Kelsey Grammer cut my power?
[36:43.470 --> 36:48.570]  Do I need to be... Should I be nervous about this? You got... You got attacked by the Grammer Hammer.
[36:48.970 --> 36:52.150]  Yeah, I did. I think this is a clear Grammer Hammer attack.
[36:52.710 --> 36:57.110]  There could be a phase two of my bit situation. Do you ever see something alarming and then just
[36:57.110 --> 37:01.490]  never do something about it and not realize it was a problem until later with like an accident
[37:01.490 --> 37:06.610]  or something? That's a weird way to describe that. You saw your outlet earlier.
[37:06.950 --> 37:10.950]  Your junction box was sparking when you went to get the air blower and you thought that'll be fine.
[37:11.710 --> 37:17.030]  Exactly. No, I had a thing when I... A long time ago, I used to have my desk at a window
[37:18.330 --> 37:21.530]  and I was watching a show. I just started Friday Night Lights
[37:22.170 --> 37:26.150]  and a power cable exploded, which I don't know if either of you have witnessed that.
[37:26.690 --> 37:31.650]  It was like a flashbang went off. It was like just this bright light blinded me for like three
[37:31.650 --> 37:37.210]  seconds. And then I looked and I could see a cable was hanging on the line and fire was shooting out
[37:37.210 --> 37:43.930]  of it like four feet. It's like a flamethrower in the air. And I looked at it. I was really
[37:43.930 --> 37:48.890]  enjoying Friday Night Lights. And I said, that's probably a problem. I turned Friday Night Lights
[37:48.890 --> 37:53.970]  back on. I just went about my day. Zero other thought. Never even occurred to me of who I
[37:53.970 --> 37:58.230]  should call or that I should call anyone. It was fine. Nothing got caught on fire. It was around a
[37:58.230 --> 38:01.790]  bunch of trees. It was super dangerous. But was the woman in the alley in danger?
[38:03.050 --> 38:07.350]  I gotta assume she was safe. Did anybody ever come to fix it?
[38:07.550 --> 38:10.810]  No, I just... The fire stopped eventually and I never saw anyone else fix it.
[38:11.030 --> 38:13.890]  I assumed it was fine. I'm sure someone lost power.
[38:14.370 --> 38:17.410]  So is your whole building off? Yeah, I have no idea. I don't know. I'm
[38:18.150 --> 38:23.110]  just just definitely my unit is. I didn't know where the fuse box was. So that was a whole search.
[38:23.630 --> 38:27.810]  You heard a loud bang, huh? Yeah, it was like a it was like a bang.
[38:27.990 --> 38:32.130]  And then everything went off. And then I heard another bang, which I assumed meant it would come
[38:32.130 --> 38:35.750]  back on. I think the bangs may have been unrelated. I think the banging noises were just
[38:35.750 --> 38:40.150]  things that happened. I was thinking that maybe it was a car crashing into the power pole outside.
[38:40.670 --> 38:43.610]  Yeah. The second bang makes no sense unless he was trying to crash it back on.
[38:45.030 --> 38:50.590]  Gavin, were you at lunch with me the day we saw that truck run into that power pole outside of
[38:50.590 --> 38:54.870]  Lucy's Fried Chicken? Oh, I think so. It was like me and you and John Mike and those guys.
[38:55.110 --> 38:59.390]  And we heard this like crazy bang. And then we looked up and there was a truck wrapped around
[38:59.390 --> 39:03.270]  a power pole in just the middle of the day. Right. And everybody just ate their fried chicken
[39:03.270 --> 39:07.830]  and watched as the ambulance showed up. Yeah. I feel like we used to see a lot of stuff happen
[39:07.830 --> 39:11.930]  like that. A lot of stuff goes on in Austin if you got your eyes open. I found the bits, guys.
[39:11.930 --> 39:15.870]  I found the bits were good. I'm only 49 bits. I feel like we're good.
[39:17.810 --> 39:22.850]  So so you got it. You got to you got to you got to kill this Kelsey Grammar story for us. It didn't
[39:22.850 --> 39:27.770]  go anywhere. How did it end up? Oh, we just we took the top of it and I'm sure they were very
[39:27.770 --> 39:32.150]  confused. So you got ahead of Kelsey Grammar. Yeah, we got ahead of Kelsey Grammar and the
[39:32.150 --> 39:36.130]  guy that runs the site. We had like two million points each and we just kept trading for the top
[39:36.130 --> 39:40.730]  of the leaderboard. And then eventually the whole site got shut down because it was a giant pyramid
[39:40.730 --> 39:45.690]  scheme. But we climbed to the top of it. Nobody ever contacted you and said congratulations or
[39:45.690 --> 39:52.250]  hey, you're no, you're fucking with the system or and you never made money out of this pyramid
[39:52.250 --> 39:58.170]  scheme. No, there was no like you could win. You could spend your points on like an HD wallpaper.
[39:58.390 --> 40:02.570]  And that was about it. There is no there is an implication that your points could be used in
[40:02.570 --> 40:07.490]  a further way. But it was it's just the wallpaper at the time. Did you buy two million points worth
[40:07.490 --> 40:12.150]  wallpaper? I should have, but no, I don't think I did. I was in a race, Geoff. This is very serious.
[40:12.270 --> 40:18.070]  I had to keep every point I had. How many HD wallpapers did they have available? Oh, just one.
[40:18.150 --> 40:25.270]  There was one. It was just the company logo. They made you pay for it. Wow. What a colossal waste of
[40:25.270 --> 40:30.490]  time. Kind of like this podcast. Nick says we're at 44 minutes already. Wait, really? Yeah. I was
[40:30.490 --> 40:35.710]  gone that long. I felt like I left like 15 minutes maybe and I came back maybe 10 minutes ago.
[40:35.710 --> 40:41.090]  You were gone for a while. Wow. I kept wanting to. I told the whole story about how I survived,
[40:41.210 --> 40:46.330]  like my mouth's better. We had a lot of a lot of discussion about whether this was content or not
[40:46.330 --> 40:51.550]  and what to do with it. We made fun of Geoff for his shelves and desk. I mean, the shelf thing is
[40:51.550 --> 40:55.770]  absurd. A lot of making fun of me for trying to improve my situation and trying to get a desk
[40:55.770 --> 41:03.090]  built so I have room to record. Geoff, what a spin that is. That is a great spin, Geoff. That's true.
[41:03.090 --> 41:06.050]  It's true. That was my whole take from the beginning.
[41:06.690 --> 41:10.810]  Geoff tried hard not to tell his amazing business plan, which I guess now he can actually tell.
[41:11.150 --> 41:13.570]  Oh, I got a new business plan. I want to talk about it.
[41:13.630 --> 41:14.950]  OK. What's your business plan?
[41:14.950 --> 41:18.450]  What do you guys think about this? And I can't take full credit. I was hanging out with Trevor
[41:18.450 --> 41:23.010]  and Barb the other day. We were hanging out, Emily and I. And we kind of came up with the
[41:23.010 --> 41:27.270]  idea together. But it's my idea. They have an idea they're going to take and run with,
[41:27.310 --> 41:29.850]  and I'm going to run with this one. You know OnlyFans, right?
[41:30.390 --> 41:30.630]  Yeah.
[41:30.630 --> 41:39.510]  Yeah. What if I started an OnlyFans where people bought audio recordings of me farting for them?
[41:40.190 --> 41:41.190]  It's funny you mentioned this.
[41:41.370 --> 41:46.830]  Like, what if I say like, like somebody pays like 50 bucks and they're like, and I take it and then
[41:46.830 --> 41:52.810]  I go, OK, happy birthday, Kyle. And then I and then that's I turn it in and then I get I fucking
[41:52.810 --> 41:57.090]  sell my farts, OnlyFarts. Well, it sounds closer to cameo. It sounds like fart cameo.
[41:57.090 --> 41:59.870]  Yeah, I was about to say, it just sounds like you're just doing cameo, but you're farting.
[41:59.870 --> 42:02.430]  Yeah, but it's like, I don't need to cameo.
[42:02.530 --> 42:06.490]  I don't want to. I don't want to undercut anything here, but that this was something
[42:06.490 --> 42:12.810]  that was discussed on the Rooster Teeth podcast that happened last night as of this recording.
[42:13.030 --> 42:14.930]  So did they mention that it was for me?
[42:15.210 --> 42:19.890]  Yes. The barber played a barber, played a fart, and then it turned into a conversation about that
[42:19.890 --> 42:26.290]  briefly about like, what if it was you could sell these? And everyone said, I think everyone
[42:26.290 --> 42:32.010]  said, like, that's gross and crazy. But here we are. So maybe you can do this thing.
[42:32.430 --> 42:35.890]  Yeah, well, that's I kind of had a different angle with your fart thing.
[42:36.230 --> 42:39.670]  This is going to come out like three weeks after that. What's what's your fart angle?
[42:39.990 --> 42:42.950]  I was thinking like, I thought, who buys albums anymore?
[42:43.590 --> 42:46.950]  What if we made like a greatest hits Geoff's fart album?
[42:46.950 --> 42:50.210]  Oh, yeah, let's try to sell that and then press it onto vinyl.
[42:50.650 --> 42:55.390]  No, not even necessarily vinyl, but like CD. I just feel like nobody would buy CDs anymore.
[42:55.390 --> 43:01.070]  How hard could it really be to have like a top CD? People still buy them in a number that would not
[43:01.070 --> 43:06.230]  be close to what we could do with your greatest farts. But it's crazy, really, because CD audio
[43:06.230 --> 43:11.570]  quality is actually really good in comparison to most streaming and like all mp3 downloads.
[43:11.750 --> 43:15.510]  It's actually a lot better sounding. I just don't have a disk drive.
[43:16.030 --> 43:22.630]  Yeah, who does? I just like I just love the idea of monetizing the air that comes out of your anus.
[43:22.630 --> 43:24.470]  I think most people can't do that.
[43:24.910 --> 43:29.950]  I think I think like if I could because I'm already the whole thing started because Barb was pissed
[43:29.950 --> 43:34.750]  off. I'd never sent her a fart and she asked for one. So I gave her a really good one called
[43:34.750 --> 43:39.830]  Brussels sprouts and garlic because that's what I was eating. And oh, it sounds like it was already
[43:39.830 --> 43:43.830]  played on the RT podcast, but I got it right here. Can you play here? It's relevant here as well.
[43:43.830 --> 43:44.910]  Here you go.
[43:48.510 --> 43:56.170]  I'll give that to Nick. You can I can smell I can smell the fart when I hear it. It was so bad.
[43:56.690 --> 44:01.030]  Emily made me go fart on the other side of the house and I brought it back. It like followed
[44:01.030 --> 44:05.170]  me. How much would you charge for that one? Would they all be the same price? Yeah, I think so. Like
[44:05.170 --> 44:11.530]  like if like I could know how about this? I give you a fart 20 bucks. Just like I walk around.
[44:11.530 --> 44:15.750]  I walk around and I just capture every fart and then I just sell them farts. But if you want a
[44:15.750 --> 44:20.030]  personalized part, no, no, no. It's like you don't want to do it. Oh, maybe. Yeah. Like maybe all my
[44:20.030 --> 44:24.090]  monthly farts are like 20 bucks or whatever, or 10 bucks a month on OnlyFans. You get access to
[44:24.090 --> 44:31.610]  all my farts. Then on another level, if you want to buy a custom fart from me and I can say like
[44:32.410 --> 44:38.890]  happy anniversary, Grandma Smith, then that's like 50 bucks because it's like you're the only
[44:38.890 --> 44:42.210]  person in the world getting that fart. It's just for you. I don't share it with anybody else.
[44:42.590 --> 44:46.210]  And it's a it's between it's a contract between you and I. What you do with the fart after that
[44:46.210 --> 44:51.510]  is your business. But but yeah, and I personalize it with a little note like, you know, you're
[44:51.510 --> 44:59.910]  finally 21 or however. OK, I don't like putting your farts behind a paywall, though. This is I'm
[44:59.910 --> 45:03.910]  now going to have to pay you for this. Andrew, you're my friend. You get access to all my farts
[45:03.910 --> 45:08.730]  for free all the time. However, I got like I'm not getting any younger. I'm definitely getting
[45:08.730 --> 45:13.750]  older. This internet video games podcasting, it's a young man's game. I got to start. I've
[45:13.750 --> 45:18.550]  been giving away farts for 18 years. I got to start. I got to start thinking about my future.
[45:18.750 --> 45:23.470]  I got to start thinking about retirement. I got to start. You know, I've given away
[45:23.470 --> 45:30.890]  a 10 lifetimes worth of farts. I think it's time that I start attaching some sort of monetary value
[45:30.890 --> 45:35.050]  to it because I think I'm worth it and I think they're worth it. Can I pay to not get them?
[45:36.490 --> 45:41.290]  That's a great question. Because I mean, you say you've been giving them away for free this
[45:41.290 --> 45:46.290]  whole time. I must have gotten thousands of dollars worth of free farts. And I feel like
[45:46.290 --> 45:50.350]  I would have paid to not have that. If you want to give me thousands of dollars, I won't send
[45:50.350 --> 45:56.670]  any more farts. No, I like them. I'm into just hearing them, not smelling them. Yeah. And it's
[45:56.670 --> 46:01.930]  like, I don't know. It's a fun little project. And, you know, everybody farts. Farts are awesome.
[46:01.930 --> 46:07.110]  Farts are fun. I think it's a big part of my personality. And I think it's one of the things
[46:07.110 --> 46:14.110]  that makes me who I am. So why shouldn't I reap the rewards of my butthole? I take good care of
[46:14.110 --> 46:20.950]  it. I bidet it all the time. You know, I'm real clean. It's a good butt. That's a great point.
[46:21.290 --> 46:27.430]  I found out something about because I've also delved into the bidet arena. I don't know where
[46:27.430 --> 46:34.890]  the middle of my butthole is when I'm spraying it. Like, I can't tell when I'm spraying the
[46:34.890 --> 46:43.430]  middle. Like, it just all feels like my butthole. I mean, it is, but I can't ever tell where it
[46:43.430 --> 46:50.950]  meets. I know what you mean, dude. I wonder if your stream is too wide. Like maybe, I don't know
[46:50.950 --> 46:56.150]  what kind of settings you have. Because sometimes I'm like, oh, I want to make... Eric said butthole
[46:56.150 --> 47:01.530]  blindness. Yeah. Sometimes I will really want to make sure it's spraying, you know, in the middle.
[47:02.050 --> 47:06.410]  But I'm on the edge and I'm like, am I in the middle? And then suddenly I'll move and it will
[47:06.410 --> 47:11.770]  like shoot water into my anus. And I'll be like, oh, that was the middle. But I can't ever tell
[47:11.770 --> 47:16.730]  just from like swinging my asshole around where I actually am. I'm right there with you, dude.
[47:16.950 --> 47:25.990]  I have traveling anus. And it's like, every time I sit down, it's a, yeah, it's always a bit of a
[47:25.990 --> 47:30.370]  And it's weird because Howard Stern talked about that a lot. Like it took him like probably a year
[47:30.370 --> 47:35.230]  of using his bidet before he dialed it in every time where he gets right in the, you know, right
[47:35.230 --> 47:42.570]  in the starfish. And I am not there yet. As much as I feel like I got to jostle and move and like
[47:42.570 --> 47:47.530]  position, every time is a different experience. Yeah, I've really got, it takes me about five to
[47:47.530 --> 47:52.290]  ten seconds to really hunt for the middle of mine. Man, once you find it though, you are
[47:53.590 --> 47:59.070]  aware. Is it a fun five to ten at least? It's frustrating. It doesn't feel bad. I just don't,
[47:59.170 --> 48:02.970]  I'm not sure whether you're meant to get it in your anus. I assume not. I think you are. I think
[48:02.970 --> 48:07.590]  you are. You are? That's where the poopoo is. Yeah, I just want to give myself an infection
[48:07.590 --> 48:12.450]  or something by blasting shit upwards when it should be going downwards. No, it's electrolyzed
[48:12.450 --> 48:16.370]  water. You'll be fine. That's what enemas are all about. Yeah, but there's some debate about
[48:16.370 --> 48:20.910]  how effective those are. Yeah, or like high colonics. High colonics, they were a big deal
[48:20.910 --> 48:25.870]  back in the early 2000s. Do I need to get on this bidet thing? Well, you had the option of a free,
[48:25.930 --> 48:31.590]  a free, uh, you said it would be an issue for vertical wipers. It is, but I mean, I don't know,
[48:31.610 --> 48:35.390]  it sounds like you guys are taking your asshole to the water park every day and that sounds fun.
[48:35.570 --> 48:39.530]  I could get on board with that. Yeah, it's like, it's like six flags in your asshole every day,
[48:39.570 --> 48:44.490]  pretty much. There's no going back. I'll tell you that, Andrew. Like once you, once you squirt,
[48:44.670 --> 48:48.370]  you will never stop. I think you should do it, Andrew. I think you should, uh, at least,
[48:48.370 --> 48:54.810]  how many bogs do you have? Uh, three. Just get one for one of them. And if you don't like it,
[48:54.850 --> 49:00.610]  just don't use that bog. Yeah. So wait, which one? Well, how hard is it to take out? Cause do
[49:00.610 --> 49:07.890]  I then put it, do I put it in the one that I use the least amount? I really struggled on that one.
[49:08.810 --> 49:12.290]  Do you have one that you don't want to use? Like if you put it in the, in the least used one
[49:12.290 --> 49:16.630]  and you like it, will you have an issue using that one all the time? Yeah. Yeah. I'd have to
[49:16.630 --> 49:22.930]  walk several floors to then just for the experience. Yeah. I live in a small space
[49:22.930 --> 49:26.650]  that's very vertical. Here's what you should do. That's why you're a vertical wiper. Yeah.
[49:27.470 --> 49:31.930]  Yeah. I'm all about that vertical lifestyle. That's uh, here's what you do. Watch a YouTube
[49:31.930 --> 49:36.410]  video and then see if it looks hard. To install, not use. You don't, you don't need to watch a
[49:36.410 --> 49:40.010]  video on how to use it. That would be great. I say just leave it alone if you don't like it,
[49:40.030 --> 49:43.870]  but just because taking it off again will be annoying. It's just easy just to not.
[49:43.870 --> 49:48.790]  That's true. I guess I have the option to just not use it, but it's always equipped. I'm prepared.
[49:49.430 --> 49:54.730]  Yeah. I mean, just, yeah, you could poo through it without using its features, I guess. Yeah.
[49:55.010 --> 50:01.050]  Okay. I might try this. I might look into this. At the, at a minimum, dude, it's got a, a seat
[50:01.050 --> 50:06.210]  heater. So even if you don't use the other functions, it will, you will have a warm toasty
[50:06.210 --> 50:10.690]  butt while you're pooping. I thought I wouldn't like that because in my head, it just, to me,
[50:10.690 --> 50:15.370]  sounded like I'd be sat on a toilet that just, it feels like someone else was just sat there.
[50:15.490 --> 50:20.650]  It doesn't feel like that at all. It feels nice, nice and warm. It feels like when you get in a
[50:20.650 --> 50:27.350]  car on a cold day that has seat warmers and you're like, ah, you just kind of relax all over. I feel
[50:27.350 --> 50:31.230]  like you do really have to get to know your anus though, because there, there have clearly been
[50:31.230 --> 50:37.650]  some times where I've not found the middle. And so after I'm done, you know, blasting and I'll
[50:37.650 --> 50:42.290]  have like a cleanup wipe. Uh, it turns out I have more blasting to do. Yeah. That's happened
[50:42.290 --> 50:46.590]  a couple of times. Oh, that sounds terrible. That sounds way worse than just not blasting at all.
[50:46.630 --> 50:50.950]  I don't want to do too much. It's a rare occurrence, dude. Yeah. It's just, I'm just
[50:50.950 --> 50:54.530]  getting used to it still. Yeah. Let us know in the comments, if you had the same thing,
[50:54.570 --> 50:59.470]  if you've also invested in a, an arse blaster. Would you or would you not want a camera in there?
[50:59.770 --> 51:04.070]  No, no, would not, would not, no. What if you could, what if you could get a camera that thing,
[51:04.070 --> 51:08.350]  have an app in your phone. You can really aim that target up. You can figure out what's going
[51:08.350 --> 51:15.050]  on. You're no longer shooting in the dark. I have never in 45 years seen my butthole.
[51:15.250 --> 51:19.790]  And I don't intend to see it now. I think you would learn things about your anus that you would,
[51:20.050 --> 51:24.430]  you can never unlearn. I'm scared to see it. I'm scared to see it. I don't want to know what
[51:24.430 --> 51:28.830]  it looks like. I'm scared. It's ugly. I'm scared. It's got, it's weird. Or I'll be like, what is that
[51:28.830 --> 51:32.130]  hanging off of it or something? Not that there's anything hanging off of it, but I don't want to
[51:32.130 --> 51:36.910]  find out. I don't want to know. What if it's, what if it's, what if it's, you know how people
[51:36.910 --> 51:40.370]  get their asshole bleached, like porn stars to get their butthole bleached. What if I find out
[51:40.370 --> 51:44.910]  I got a really like brown butthole and then I'm just like horrified. I don't want to know.
[51:45.650 --> 51:49.050]  We may live in the future, but I still don't want to have a conversation with someone
[51:49.050 --> 51:53.210]  where I'm explaining to them that I need to wipe the lens on my toilet. I don't think,
[51:53.470 --> 52:01.130]  I think that's too much of a first world problem to have. Also, a butthole works in a way that you
[52:01.130 --> 52:09.050]  may not realize in that it kind of, it kind of turns like a little bit inside out when you do
[52:09.050 --> 52:18.150]  some twos. Oh, like a prolapse? Like it kind of has to feed it out by basically slightly protruding.
[52:19.350 --> 52:23.150]  Does it look kind of like when you take a long sleeve shirt off and it gets stuck at the,
[52:23.210 --> 52:26.610]  at the wrist? I mean, I don't know what it looks like. I just know that that was
[52:26.610 --> 52:31.830]  explained to me by a doctor once when I had a bit of a butthole issue a few years ago.
[52:32.810 --> 52:37.690]  I feel like maybe you should expound upon that. I wasn't aware that you had a butthole issue.
[52:37.790 --> 52:40.770]  Do you want to talk about it? Oh yeah, I talked about it on a podcast. I had to have some
[52:41.970 --> 52:46.550]  suppositories. I had to put some wax pills up my ass for a little while.
[52:46.870 --> 52:51.010]  Were you just constipated? I can't remember the issue I was having.
[52:51.570 --> 52:55.170]  How do you not remember the issue? Suppositories help you shit more typically, so...
[52:55.590 --> 52:57.930]  Oh, I think I would just, I think I shat some blood once.
[52:59.450 --> 53:04.510]  Yeah, that was it. I just blasted, uh, I just blasted the bowl with blood and I got really
[53:04.510 --> 53:08.630]  worried. So the solution was shit more? No, no, no. The suppositories were like
[53:08.630 --> 53:12.430]  to reduce inflammation, I think. But the thing that, the thing is, and I think the part I told
[53:12.430 --> 53:16.870]  on the podcast was that you might have, I had, I was having a really hard time keeping them up there
[53:17.370 --> 53:22.570]  because you put something in your butt like that and it just, to me, felt like I needed to poo.
[53:22.570 --> 53:27.710]  Like I really needed to go. But you're supposed to like lock it in and wait for it to melt a
[53:27.710 --> 53:32.110]  little. But one of the times I was doing it, I was like about to head out the door, like there
[53:32.110 --> 53:38.330]  was an Uber waiting. So I shoved it up before work and I didn't really have enough time to let it
[53:38.330 --> 53:42.090]  melt. So I was like, I just was holding, I was just clenching it while I was grabbing all my
[53:42.090 --> 53:46.730]  stuff and running out the front door. And as I opened my front door, it just blasted back out
[53:46.730 --> 53:53.370]  into my boxes. So I had to go back inside and like change my boxes and like clean out a load
[53:53.370 --> 54:00.010]  of waxy. It was awful. It's a terrible story. That was an awesome story. So then I had to put
[54:00.010 --> 54:07.350]  another one up. Thanks for listening to the most broken episode of F***face that we could ever have
[54:07.350 --> 54:12.730]  made. I loved it. It was, it was something. Andrew, thanks for figuring out a way to make
[54:12.730 --> 54:17.170]  it back to us, buddy. It's, uh, it's no problem trying to do a bit check already. Yeah. Yeah.
[54:17.190 --> 54:22.030]  Let's see what your final bits are at. You're at like 61.53. Oh, I got bits for days. I got
[54:22.030 --> 54:26.950]  bits for days. This is easy. This is no problem at all. You only spent like 20 bits or 25 bits,
[54:26.990 --> 54:33.510]  maybe. Yeah. Since I last did my bit check. Yeah. 20 bits. Wow. I assumed it would be way more.
[54:33.930 --> 54:41.410]  I guess not. I'd be at zero. Well, congratulations. Yeah. Thanks. This is a great, uh, no power.
[54:41.930 --> 54:46.730]  Fantastic. I'm excited to actually listen to an episode because I'm not, I'm not in part of it.
[54:46.790 --> 54:51.590]  So this is great. If you're listening to this with power or without power, or you have a butthole,
[54:51.730 --> 54:54.790]  go ahead and like and subscribe. We really appreciate it. Leave us a review. Talk about
[54:54.790 --> 54:58.870]  your butthole. Talk about how happy it is when you listen to F***face. Was your, was the butthole
[54:58.870 --> 55:02.870]  stuff too much? I feel like we could maybe trim some of that out. It's a bit vulgar. No, I think
[55:02.870 --> 55:07.470]  it's, that's, it was more medical than anything. Yeah. I just, I don't, I don't think it was super
[55:07.930 --> 55:13.250]  medical. I also think it was obviously vulgar. So it's weird. Like we just kept stacking on. So
[55:13.250 --> 55:17.010]  what do you mean? You think it was, it was definitely vulgar. Uh, Nick says it's under
[55:17.010 --> 55:21.550]  the medicine umbrella and we didn't even mention the part. Eric says, nope, all good. We didn't
[55:21.550 --> 55:27.690]  even mention the part where Eric says that pooping is like puckering your lips, which that was a
[55:27.690 --> 55:31.930]  little gross. I thought like your butthole. It looks like puckering lips when you, when you go.
[55:31.950 --> 55:36.530]  Eric, have you seen it? I can't confirm or deny. I can just let you know that what you're describing
[55:36.530 --> 55:43.250]  is what that's like. So Nick says he saw it. Well, thanks for listening to this episode
[55:43.250 --> 55:50.090]  of F*** Face. Andrew and Joyce sitting in the dark and guys, we'll see you next time on F*** Face.
