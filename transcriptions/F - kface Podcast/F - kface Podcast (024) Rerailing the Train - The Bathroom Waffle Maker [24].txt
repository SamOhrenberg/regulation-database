[00:46.260 --> 00:50.540]  Are we going to do an intro? Or do we have to? Yeah, I think we're very serious about the intro.
[00:50.940 --> 00:56.840]  The belch was the intro. Welcome to F*** Face. It's a podcast. I thought we had more time because
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.120]  Andrew was pissing about. I took a mouthful. Hold on. What are you eating? You weren't talking.
[01:01.360 --> 01:05.540]  You just interrupted the intro to say that you couldn't talk when you weren't talking. No, I do.
[01:05.540 --> 01:10.520]  It's a peanut butter thing. It'll take me forever. Hold on. It was a nutty, nutty buddy.
[01:11.120 --> 01:15.060]  Oh, nutty buddies are good. Is that like a candy? Do they have those in England?
[01:15.460 --> 01:19.760]  Not that I've ever seen. Yeah. That's why America's better. What is a nutty buddy?
[01:20.140 --> 01:23.880]  America loves putting peanut butter and chocolate in the same place. Oh yeah, baby.
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.460]  Oh yeah. I'm okay with it. It's because we know what's up. All right. You can continue on the
[01:29.460 --> 01:36.060]  intro. What are you guys? All right, hold on. Hello and welcome to another hilarious or deep
[01:36.060 --> 01:43.180]  thinking or provocative or boring episode of F*** Face. I believe it's episode 23. Is that sound
[01:43.180 --> 01:50.680]  right, Nick? 24. 24, whatever. 16. My name is Geoff and oh, the 16 joke is so played out,
[01:50.780 --> 01:55.020]  Andrew, please. That's so passe. That's so last week and the week before and the week before.
[01:55.020 --> 01:59.420]  You're the absolute worst. You're Andrew Pantin. I am Geoff Ramsey and Gavin Free
[01:59.420 --> 02:03.440]  has got a mouthful of penis or peanut butter or something. His mouth was so full,
[02:03.480 --> 02:10.000]  I couldn't understand what he was saying. That's me. Yeah. Hey, penis mouth. You were just talking
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.560]  about how... I'm padding a little bit because I have to have a potentially uncomfortable
[02:15.560 --> 02:21.280]  conversation with you in specific and I'm beating around the bush here. But you were just saying...
[02:21.280 --> 02:28.920]  My anus? No, no, no. Well, no, not that I can see, but if you can draw the line out and connect it
[02:28.920 --> 02:35.840]  to it'll be interesting. OK. And I'm willing to go there. You were just saying that America loves
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.280]  to put peanut butter and chocolate together, which is, I guess, I wouldn't think a unique
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.580]  thing, but that not done as much in England as it is in the States. Is that what you're getting at?
[02:44.940 --> 02:49.300]  If it is done, I'd never noticed it. I never noticed it. I mean, it's a thing here.
[02:49.300 --> 02:55.340]  Everything with peanut butter is with chocolate. So let me ask you this. What are two things that
[02:55.340 --> 03:01.020]  get put together in the U.K. that are kind of synonymous with like, like in America,
[03:01.160 --> 03:06.320]  it's like chocolate and peanut butter. It's a joke. What is there like, like black currant and
[03:06.320 --> 03:10.340]  I don't know, toffee or like what do you what is the combination in England
[03:10.340 --> 03:14.260]  that is in everything that you just don't see here? Tea and hot water.
[03:16.740 --> 03:21.800]  I don't think that answers the question because all the tea here is freaking freezing.
[03:21.960 --> 03:23.800]  Well, it literally is. It's iced tea in it.
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.180]  Nobody. Wait, I'm not a tea drinker. Nobody drinks warm tea in America.
[03:30.500 --> 03:34.320]  They do all the time. But it's like, it's not the, like, usually if you order tea,
[03:34.340 --> 03:39.700]  you have to specify if you want it hot or cold. Oh, my God. That's not what I expected to say,
[03:39.740 --> 03:41.840]  but I'll take it. I'll take it. What did you expect?
[03:41.840 --> 03:49.380]  It's definitely not as popular here as it is. What I would expect, like potato chips and prawns
[03:49.380 --> 03:53.040]  or I don't know, like you guys always have prawn cocktail crisps. You're right.
[03:53.640 --> 03:58.840]  They're pretty rank, though. I mean, sorry to anyone who likes a nice Walker's prawn cocktail.
[03:59.700 --> 04:01.580]  Do you? Does your family eat those?
[04:02.360 --> 04:05.700]  Not really. We never really like junk food family.
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.820]  What is is there a food that your family ate a lot that you just couldn't stand,
[04:11.980 --> 04:16.220]  but that like your family is really into? Like for me, I'll give you an example. For me,
[04:16.300 --> 04:23.520]  growing up in the south in Alabama and Florida and Louisiana, my family, they ate collard greens
[04:23.520 --> 04:28.220]  constantly. I can't fucking stand collard greens. And the thought of them makes me retch a little
[04:28.220 --> 04:33.540]  bit. Is there like a thing that you guys like every meal there's a plate, like a bowl of collard
[04:33.540 --> 04:39.780]  greens and they're like, eat up, it's iron. One thing that was strange for me after I grew up and
[04:39.780 --> 04:44.300]  started working in a supermarket with veg and fruit and stuff is, you know, like a gooseberry.
[04:44.820 --> 04:50.160]  No, but what is spelled like gooseberry? It's like a green thing, but apparently you're supposed
[04:50.160 --> 04:56.540]  to cook them or like mash them into jam and stuff. But everyone in my family just used to eat them
[04:56.540 --> 05:02.000]  cold and raw. And I think that is not the way it's supposed to be. But honestly,
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.880]  I can't eat them any other way. And they're, they're so, yeah, there you go. Eric just posted
[05:05.880 --> 05:13.060]  some gooseberries. They're actually like awful. They're, they're, they're hairy. Uh, I don't know
[05:13.060 --> 05:17.960]  why everyone in my family just started snacking on these things. And they're so immensely sour.
[05:18.240 --> 05:22.540]  You're supposed to wait for them to get squishy, I guess. And they turn a little bit sweeter, but
[05:22.540 --> 05:28.760]  everyone in my family ate them under ripe and raw. And that's the only way I know how to eat them.
[05:28.760 --> 05:34.880]  I have a similar thing. Everybody, everybody in my family, they're fucking gross looking,
[05:34.980 --> 05:40.580]  by the way. Uh, everybody in my family eats turnip root raw, like an onion or like a,
[05:40.620 --> 05:44.080]  like if you were to eat a raw potato. I don't know if you've ever eaten turnip root,
[05:44.260 --> 05:47.780]  but I don't know anybody outside of my family that does it. I don't even know anybody else in
[05:47.780 --> 05:52.460]  the South that did it. It was just something that we do. Just get a big ass turnip root and just
[05:52.460 --> 05:56.440]  walk around, chew on it all day. It's always weird when something you grew up with as normal
[05:56.440 --> 06:01.960]  is revealed to you as incredibly strange behavior. And I noticed that a lot more after having moved
[06:01.960 --> 06:08.180]  to America, like looking back on the way Americans react to the monarchy and how that is totally
[06:08.180 --> 06:12.200]  normal for me to have a queen. But now I've lived here for so long, it's like, it's actually super
[06:12.200 --> 06:17.740]  weird that there's still a monarchy in the year 2020. That's crazy. It's a little odd. Yeah.
[06:18.020 --> 06:23.620]  You guys just love your tradition. I don't think I have one of those. A tradition? No, no,
[06:24.340 --> 06:28.520]  tradition's obvious, but I'm saying like a cultural barrier. Like Canada, I don't feel
[06:28.520 --> 06:33.040]  like we have like a shocking twist like that. You guys have poutine, which I think is really gross.
[06:33.500 --> 06:41.540]  Why is cheese with fries gross with gravy? It's not cheese, it's cheese curd. It's the C-U-R-D.
[06:41.980 --> 06:48.520]  It's like lumpy and weird and inconsistent and gross. I don't like it. It's really good. No.
[06:48.520 --> 06:54.280]  I've never had it. On paper, it isn't great. And even a picture of it isn't great. But poutine
[06:54.280 --> 07:00.400]  is delicious down the throat. I can't. I respect that people like it and I recognize that I'm in
[07:00.400 --> 07:04.780]  the minority, but it kind of creeps me out. I honestly didn't realize that you disliked a food
[07:04.780 --> 07:11.000]  that wasn't white. Yeah, I listen. I don't like, it's well documented throughout my professional
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.460]  career that I do not like most things that are white. But there are some other colors
[07:17.020 --> 07:22.440]  in certain combinations that I'm not crazy about. Definitely, definitely poutine. I don't like to
[07:22.440 --> 07:26.020]  say it. I don't like to think it. I don't like to think it. I don't like the word curd now. It's
[07:26.020 --> 07:32.860]  not. Poutine is a fun word. I'll fight you on that. It sounds, it sounds like, it sounds like a
[07:32.860 --> 07:37.960]  diarrhea. And it kind of looks like a diarrhea. Eric has just posted a picture of some poutine
[07:37.960 --> 07:43.980]  and looking at it in comparison to that pot of gooseberries, the poutine is way more appetizing
[07:43.980 --> 07:47.000]  to look at. Yeah, that's true. I'll give you that.
[07:49.500 --> 07:55.700]  I have a, I think there's something that Andrew needs to answer for based on when I was listening
[07:55.700 --> 07:59.760]  to a previous episode. I think it was the one from two weeks ago. Okay. Well, I don't know if
[07:59.760 --> 08:04.520]  you remember Andrew, but you said this. For kids. And so let's change all the weapons of the puke
[08:04.520 --> 08:10.460]  guns. So the bad guys puke. Kids think puke is real fun. Is the drowning scene in the game as well?
[08:10.960 --> 08:17.560]  I've never played or watched Minority Report. I've never played or watched Minority Report.
[08:17.940 --> 08:22.200]  Yes. Is that a good movie? It's not bad, is it? Minority Report? Yeah, I remember being a very
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.300]  blue movie. I think it's okay. It's okay. I enjoyed it. It's not one of those movies I've,
[08:26.300 --> 08:30.300]  I think I've seen it twice, but I don't think I, it's not a movie I'd want to see again. No. I
[08:30.300 --> 08:34.100]  feel like the action in it and the, and the kind of just the pacing of the movie is really good,
[08:34.940 --> 08:41.900]  no less than 25 seconds later, you contradicted yourself. I assumed to mess with us and somehow
[08:41.900 --> 08:46.480]  neither of us noticed. How often do you do this to us? How often do you just lie to our faces?
[08:46.580 --> 08:51.580]  Have you seen it or not? I definitely haven't seen it. And I completely anticipated you two
[08:51.580 --> 08:56.180]  to make a joke about it. I wasn't anticipating just having a fake Minority Report review
[08:56.180 --> 09:00.880]  in the thing, because I just said I didn't see it. So then immediately give an opinion,
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.580]  which I'm talking about the pacing and action is absurd. So I expected you two to make a comment
[09:05.580 --> 09:10.700]  about it and it just nothing happened. So then I was listening to that back. I was like, what the
[09:10.700 --> 09:15.560]  hell? How did that slip by both of us? It's not like we went to somewhere else in the conversation
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.420]  and came back. That was no, that was just the conversation as it played out. Zero reaction
[09:20.420 --> 09:25.160]  by both of you. I have an answer to that. And I got to say on the face of it, it looks pretty
[09:25.160 --> 09:30.820]  bad to us. It makes us look fucking stupid. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to double back to
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.840]  where I was the other week. And when Andrew talks, I sometimes I just check out. But it doesn't make
[09:35.840 --> 09:40.800]  any sense because I'm so excited to listen to Andrew every week. I literally hear him for about
[09:40.800 --> 09:46.720]  an hour a week. And so the fact that half the shit he says I don't hear is disturbing to me.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.620]  I will say I appreciate you bringing that moment up because I did some some work. I have a lot
[09:53.620 --> 09:58.060]  of stuff prepped for this episode. I have a lot to talk about. But one of the things I did, Geoff,
[09:58.100 --> 10:02.700]  a few weeks ago, we recorded a bunch in advance. So this is going to be a little weird. Went on
[10:02.700 --> 10:09.040]  this whole thing about Jack's moment. Jack loved the gavel, the gavel line by Gavin, Judge Gavel.
[10:09.140 --> 10:14.960]  Superfan Jack as we call him. Superfan Jack. Yes, exactly. As we call him. Loved the gavel line.
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.020]  So I asked Jack, could he give us a moment, his favorite moment of the last episode? And that was
[10:21.020 --> 10:28.260]  the moment. The Minority Report scene. Jack moment, he scales at 7.5. That's a 7.5 Jack moment of the
[10:28.260 --> 10:34.320]  week. So just anyone keeping track. Judge Gavel's a nine, just so we have the scale. Jack really
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.780]  loves the shit that gets no reaction whatsoever. He does. He's a big fan of it. I believe he said
[10:39.780 --> 10:46.020]  it gave him a solid chuckle or two, but that is a 7.5 on the Jack scale of, I guess, missable moments.
[10:46.220 --> 10:50.720]  That's funny. Hey, by the way, I don't want to derail that, but when there's an appropriate
[10:50.720 --> 10:56.960]  time to crowbar it in, this whole Minority Report joke thing reminded me of a f***face story
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.160]  from my past that I haven't thought about since I was like 18. Is that you saying you're not
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.700]  gonna tell it yet? Yeah. No, I just don't want to derail Andrew if he's going in a direction,
[11:06.860 --> 11:11.140]  but I wanted to pipe in and say it just so we don't get too far down the road. You did derail it though.
[11:12.260 --> 11:18.320]  Yeah, but now I'm offering to rerail Andrew. You derailed the train to say you're open to
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.720]  rerail it, is what you did. That's fine. You go ahead. You tell your story. I'd love to hear it.
[11:22.900 --> 11:27.840]  Okay. When I was... I'm going to try... I'm remembering this. It's popping into my head
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.500]  as we're having the conversation, so I'll do my best to explain it. When I was in... You guys know
[11:33.500 --> 11:39.920]  I was in the Army for five years, from 18 to 23, and I was a journalist, Army photojournalist and
[11:39.920 --> 11:49.000]  print journalist. And I was in journalism school in the military, which was a very difficult school.
[11:49.540 --> 11:55.040]  Only about 50% of the people that enter that school graduate. It's got the second highest
[11:55.040 --> 12:00.240]  failure rate out of all schools in the military, or at least it did at the time. I think it was
[12:00.240 --> 12:05.280]  behind linguistics and maybe air traffic control, so maybe it was the third. Anyway, I never expected
[12:05.280 --> 12:12.080]  to pass it because I was a shit student and kind of a shit everything, and I was super mediocre.
[12:12.480 --> 12:17.800]  And I just realized that throughout my life, I've been a C student. No matter how difficult school
[12:17.800 --> 12:23.360]  is, I could go to Harvard and be a C student, or I could go to a community college and still be a
[12:23.360 --> 12:30.440]  C student. I just am dead in that 70 to 75 zone, always on the brink of failing, but just doing
[12:30.440 --> 12:36.940]  enough. I don't know how I've been able to make it 45 years like that, but that just seems to be
[12:36.940 --> 12:42.160]  my trajectory. So I didn't expect to pass journalism school because people were dropping
[12:42.160 --> 12:48.980]  like flies all around me. And I think we started with 48 people, and we graduated like 23,
[12:49.220 --> 12:54.220]  so more than half the people failed out and had to go like fucking hump guns and be artillery and
[12:54.220 --> 13:01.540]  MPs and shit. And so during journalism school, you go through this intensive period where you,
[13:01.700 --> 13:06.960]  it's called feats, where you have to learn how to write features. And the goal is the first one
[13:06.960 --> 13:13.900]  you turn in, they dismantle you and just destroy you emotionally and mentally. And there were
[13:13.900 --> 13:17.320]  people you would turn in the paper, there were people that got like, their first grade was like
[13:17.320 --> 13:26.160]  a negative 70. There was somebody, like one of my best friends got like a negative 25. I got like a
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.680]  30, and I felt like a fucking hero. But your mind is just Swiss cheese during this period,
[13:31.740 --> 13:36.340]  because you're still like training and going and like fucking living in the woods and it's freezing
[13:36.340 --> 13:40.780]  and... How do you get a negative though? They will just, they just find enough mistakes to give you
[13:40.780 --> 13:45.920]  negative. It's purely only to demoralize you. If instead of turning it in, I turned in like an
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.620]  apple, would I get a higher score? Yeah, potential, potentially. But that's not the
[13:50.620 --> 13:54.660]  point of the exercise. The point of the exercise is to is just to shit down your mouth and see how
[13:54.660 --> 14:01.440]  you respond. And it's a kind of the army as a whole. So I was in like, the third week of this,
[14:01.520 --> 14:08.060]  like feats three. And I was known as the school's called DINFOS, the Defense Information School.
[14:08.200 --> 14:15.180]  And I was known as the DINFOS sleeper, because I could not stay awake. I fell asleep in class
[14:15.180 --> 14:19.460]  every day, they would make me stand up and go to the back. I fell asleep standing up,
[14:19.760 --> 14:25.020]  fell onto a wall once, kind of like you did in the in the closet during the making of RVB season
[14:25.020 --> 14:31.120]  five. And I went to do an interview with a guy, a very serious interview for my feats three,
[14:31.440 --> 14:40.620]  it was a dude who was on a on a shooting range in the military and a Marine went nuts and started
[14:40.620 --> 14:45.840]  shooting at people. And this guy had to kill the Marine, he had to shoot him and to defend the
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.440]  other people. It's a guy just like lost his mind on a shooting range. This is in the late 80s,
[14:49.500 --> 14:56.400]  probably. And I was interviewing him about this. And I kept falling asleep during the interview.
[14:56.860 --> 14:57.560]  Oh my god.
[14:57.820 --> 15:02.140]  But there were two other people that are with me. And so I thought I got away with it. I would like
[15:02.140 --> 15:07.160]  not off catch myself not enough and wake up. And when I got home that night, or when I got to the
[15:07.160 --> 15:14.160]  night, I started to transcribe my notes from my little tape recorder. And in the tape recorder,
[15:14.660 --> 15:19.360]  while I was sometimes I was sleeping, he would stop telling the story. And they just start saying
[15:19.360 --> 15:24.920]  shit to me about me being asleep, or being an idiot, or I was never gonna pass. And then as I
[15:24.920 --> 15:29.380]  started to come back around, he would just effortlessly dive back into the story. And I
[15:29.380 --> 15:35.200]  interviewed the dude for fucking 45 minutes. And he never said a word to me. I never knew I left
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.340]  thinking that was a pretty good interview. And I don't think he caught me sleeping at all. And
[15:38.340 --> 15:42.140]  the two people that I was with never said a word to me. I wish I still had that tape. In the tape,
[15:42.200 --> 15:48.420]  he's just like, just making fun of me, calling me dumb, making fun of my big ears, like telling me
[15:48.420 --> 15:52.700]  there's no way I'm gonna pass this class, just making up shit. And he probably did it like seven
[15:52.700 --> 15:56.140]  or eight times throughout the course of this interview. And I got back and I felt like the
[15:56.140 --> 16:01.460]  dumbest motherfucker. I was so fucking embarrassed. And then I passed with like a 74.
[16:01.880 --> 16:06.200]  That's crazy that because you probably heard the entire story. You must have kept waking up,
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.120]  being like, I feel like I'm still on board. Every time I would like jostle back awake,
[16:11.420 --> 16:15.840]  he would just be in the middle of, I'd be missing some of it, but I cut with context clues.
[16:16.300 --> 16:20.880]  It doesn't sound to me like that would be a boring story.
[16:21.080 --> 16:26.840]  No, no, it wasn't boring at all, dude. I was fucking, I was just tired. I was just, I was
[16:26.840 --> 16:32.080]  sleep concept that you think you could sneakily sleep. Like when you sleep, there's nothing subtle
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.480]  about sleeping covers. Not at all. You can't hide that. It's so obvious. Like you, your head tilts.
[16:38.300 --> 16:42.360]  Absolutely. Can't you like facing him in a chair? Like, well, yeah,
[16:43.020 --> 16:47.900]  he was at a desk and I was at the end of the desk, but he was talking to two other people
[16:47.900 --> 16:54.300]  as well. And so I'd be like three people. Isn't a lot. You don't get lost. I'm a crowd. I know.
[16:54.300 --> 16:59.020]  I know it sounds ludicrous. And I wish I had the tape to go back and play it to you because it
[16:59.020 --> 17:04.420]  sounds impossible. I guess they must have been in on it or he signaled them to shut the fuck
[17:04.420 --> 17:09.300]  up or something. But like when I transcribed that tape, it was like, it was like my heart fell
[17:09.880 --> 17:17.120]  through my body and then like dribbled out my dick all over my shoes. And I just had like bloody
[17:17.620 --> 17:23.880]  dick heart all over my feet. And I was like, I never, I haven't thought about it since then.
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.440]  And, uh, and I was just like, there is no fucking way I'm passing the school.
[17:28.620 --> 17:33.040]  He's going to tell my teachers. These teachers are really smart and hard.
[17:33.540 --> 17:40.080]  Uh, and I'm fucking done. And then I, I asked somebody about it later and they were go and
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.280]  they said, oh yeah, he does that all the time. Uh, people are always falling asleep. We keep
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.380]  you guys so tired that it just, it's common because you know, they're getting you up at
[17:49.380 --> 17:52.520]  like five in the morning and you're like doing like a five mile road march and then you have
[17:52.520 --> 17:57.660]  nine hours of class and then you go do drills and stuff in the evening and then you get to start
[17:57.660 --> 18:03.200]  writing your paper at like 8pm and you have to have, and you have to do it till like 3am and
[18:03.200 --> 18:06.140]  then you get three hours of sleep or two hours of sleep and then you do it again. You did that for
[18:06.140 --> 18:12.140]  eight months essentially. And so they, they keep you so like, it's almost like Scientology, right?
[18:12.140 --> 18:16.440]  They keep you so sleep deprived you'll believe anything. That tape has to be somewhere, right?
[18:16.780 --> 18:22.440]  I don't think so. I, maybe, maybe. Well certainly it's somewhere. I have, I have a, I have a briefcase
[18:22.440 --> 18:25.960]  full of my old uh, journalism school shit. I can go through it and see if it's there.
[18:26.820 --> 18:30.880]  That'd be amazing. I doubt it would be, but maybe I kept it and didn't realize it. Anyway,
[18:31.020 --> 18:36.180]  that's uh, that's my, my 18 year old f*** face journalism school story that Andrew's
[18:36.180 --> 18:39.760]  minority report thing just popped into my head that I probably haven't thought about in 25 years.

[19:58.830 --> 20:04.570]  Do you have a butthole? Well, then this ad is for you. Actually, it's not for you. It's for
[20:04.570 --> 20:09.530]  your butthole. So you can tune out, but I would like your butthole to pay attention. If you feel
[20:09.530 --> 20:13.230]  more comfortable, if you don't want to be a part of the conversation, why don't you stand up, turn
[20:13.230 --> 20:19.310]  around, put your butthole towards the screen, and I'll talk directly to it. It's hard to believe,
[20:19.450 --> 20:24.670]  butthole, that when you go to the bathroom in this country, your owner, I guess he doesn't own
[20:24.670 --> 20:32.390]  you, he or she, they don't own you, I guess your human partner tends to wipe. What an antiquated,
[20:32.390 --> 20:40.730]  terrible, Machiavellian torture for such a tender, kind soul as the butt. All you do,
[20:40.810 --> 20:47.450]  all day long, what an unsung hero. You sit, you stand, you eliminate waste, and you keep us comfy
[20:47.450 --> 20:53.470]  and cozy, and sometimes you look pretty good. If I've been playing enough tennis, you know,
[20:53.590 --> 20:58.370]  I don't look too bad. Anyway, I think it's criminal, and that's why I want you to learn
[20:58.370 --> 21:04.570]  about bidets. Yes, that's right. Never again shall we sandpaper your poor little anus apart.

[22:36.290 --> 22:40.910]  I just want to give you credit. You perfectly tied a bow. You put the train back on the tracks
[22:40.910 --> 22:44.850]  with a Scientology comment. It was perfect. I don't think that was even intentional.
[22:44.850 --> 22:49.210]  You did a great job. That's a great transition back. Are we about to go into Scientology?
[22:49.590 --> 22:54.890]  Nah, I have... going back to the food, if we want to put the train in reverse, I've had... I made
[22:54.890 --> 23:00.170]  a change in my life recently, food-related. Oh no. And it has been groundbreaking. You started eating
[23:00.170 --> 23:06.130]  eggs. No, haven't done that yet. That's not even in consideration. What I did, and let me tell you,
[23:06.190 --> 23:09.190]  this is... you're going to have to stay with me. This is a little... it's a little weird,
[23:09.330 --> 23:14.090]  but it may be the best choice I've made in a long time. I bought myself a waffle maker.
[23:14.090 --> 23:19.530]  I make morning waffles as soon as I wake up. I put it in my bathroom, I brush my teeth,
[23:19.870 --> 23:24.410]  I mix a waffle, I have a waffle every day. So you're like... you're like a La Quinta Inn.
[23:24.830 --> 23:29.930]  I don't know what that is. It's a hotel famous for their morning waffles. Oh, well, I guess.
[23:30.070 --> 23:35.890]  Make your own waffles. Did you say you put the waffle in your bathroom? I do, because the sink
[23:35.890 --> 23:40.610]  is right there, and I have the mixer under the sink, and then I have the powder. You can't just
[23:40.610 --> 23:45.710]  casually say these things. I'm like properly listening now, all right? Every time you put
[23:45.710 --> 23:51.510]  them out, I'm listening to every single word. Are you an insane person? What do you mean? No,
[23:51.770 --> 23:58.110]  no. It's... listen, being able to make a breakfast food from your room is revolutionary. It's maybe
[23:58.110 --> 24:03.170]  the greatest thing I've ever done. I put it in the bathroom because the sink is there. I put the mix,
[24:03.370 --> 24:07.590]  I put the mix in the container, then I add the water with the sink, I stir it up, and then I
[24:07.590 --> 24:13.490]  pour my waffle. It's in the bathroom sink? No, it's next to the sink. I have a counter,
[24:13.650 --> 24:17.550]  it's a sink... I probably should move it out of the bathroom, now that I think about it,
[24:17.590 --> 24:22.470]  that's a moisture area. There's a reason that a bathroom, not the most hygienic place, if you've
[24:22.470 --> 24:27.890]  got a toilet in there, there's fecal particles. The lid's down. The lid's down by us, you're
[24:27.890 --> 24:31.650]  flushing that thing, it's going everywhere, landing on your waffle machine. It's definitely
[24:31.650 --> 24:36.030]  not. It's definitely not landing on the waffle machine. Even if it did, the waffle machine would
[24:36.030 --> 24:42.470]  superheat it away. It's just, it's been a huge change, and I would recommend, maybe don't put
[24:42.470 --> 24:46.650]  it in your bathroom, but get a waffle maker, put it somewhere in your room, get a little bit of
[24:46.650 --> 24:52.190]  Pam, it's great. They're easy to make. Is all of that stuff in the bathroom with the waffle maker?
[24:52.250 --> 24:58.050]  Oh yeah, I got my measuring cup under the sink, and then I got the mix in one of the side drawers
[24:58.050 --> 25:04.650]  next to my razors and stuff. Andrew, let me, I'm gonna just, this is a bad idea. Okay. A,
[25:04.650 --> 25:12.090]  it's a terrible idea to have food prep in a place of fecal excitation. Everything is very secure.
[25:12.790 --> 25:18.670]  And two, waffles every day, you're gonna die. Well, here's the thing. We haven't got to,
[25:18.850 --> 25:23.310]  I made a mistake here. Let me just first, let me just bring up, I'm working, I have some pretty
[25:23.310 --> 25:29.570]  fucking cool, this is my waffle maker. It is fantastic. It makes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
[25:29.570 --> 25:33.990]  waffles that are really fucking cool. So it's just a good way to start your morning.
[25:34.750 --> 25:40.390]  First of all, there's some joy. It's fucking awesome. It wasn't even that expensive. Can I,
[25:40.510 --> 25:46.030]  can I come out in support of this? I, I, I think the opposite of Gavin. I think this is ingenious,
[25:46.150 --> 25:50.970]  and I think it's efficient. And I'm, I'm all for it. This is the problem now. Just imagining you
[25:51.490 --> 25:57.370]  soaking wet, like towel wrapped around you, mixing waffle mix, taking a dump, you get off,
[25:57.470 --> 26:00.710]  the waffles are made. No, no, no, no, no. It's ridiculous. No, no, no, no. Does the,
[26:00.810 --> 26:03.890]  does the waffle maker make you sing the song to yourself while you're doing it?
[26:03.890 --> 26:07.910]  No, it's just, the whole thing is a joy, Geoff. Every part of it. I don't even need to sing the
[26:07.910 --> 26:14.030]  song. It's fantastic. Do you keep syrup in there with you? No, but I have a mini fridge in my room
[26:14.030 --> 26:17.730]  and I put the, I butter in there. So I'm set. I'm not a big syrup guy, but I got a little bit
[26:17.730 --> 26:23.290]  of butter. Butter in your bedroom, waffles in the bathroom. What's in the kitchen? Shampoo?
[26:23.850 --> 26:28.010]  No, I got a lot. Actually, I'm looking into getting a second waffle maker for my kitchen
[26:28.010 --> 26:31.810]  because it's kind of an inconvenience when I'm in the kitchen. The first one should be in the
[26:31.810 --> 26:36.290]  kitchen. The second one is the bathroom one. No, no, no. I get way more use out of it in my
[26:36.290 --> 26:40.070]  bathroom than I would in the kitchen. But it's just, sometimes you want a waffle in a kitchen
[26:40.070 --> 26:43.650]  and it's an inconvenience to go all the way to my room to get the waffle maker and pull it back.
[26:43.990 --> 26:48.070]  It would never happen. How far is your bedroom slash bathroom from the kitchen? It's a different
[26:48.070 --> 26:53.990]  floor. So it's some work. It's, it's, it's some stairs. It requires thought. You got to think
[26:53.990 --> 26:57.730]  about it if you're going to go down there. Have you noticed a change in your health since
[26:57.730 --> 27:03.290]  consuming? What is waffle mix? Like flour and eggs every day? What is it? We're going to get
[27:03.290 --> 27:08.570]  into that. You guys are going to laugh at me. Cause some waffle mix, you have to get an egg.
[27:09.110 --> 27:15.430]  Yeah. I mean, I go with ones that don't need eggs. It's often optional. I think he's right. It's
[27:15.430 --> 27:22.050]  usually, you just mix it up with milk or water. Oh boy. This is, uh, I don't even know how to
[27:22.050 --> 27:25.490]  approach this. You guys are going to laugh. I feel like you're about to admit something that
[27:25.490 --> 27:33.850]  you know is insane to us. Well, did you know that pancake mix and waffle mix are not the same
[27:33.850 --> 27:39.830]  thing? Correct. I thought that they were because sometimes you see pancake and waffle mix as a
[27:39.830 --> 27:45.130]  joint product. So if you can make pancake and waffle mix, why wouldn't every mix you make be
[27:45.130 --> 27:50.690]  a pancake and waffle mix? What's the point of even having a specific pancake and a specific waffle
[27:50.690 --> 28:00.490]  mix? It makes no sense. So I bought, I was on Amazon yesterday and I'm running low. I'm running
[28:00.490 --> 28:04.550]  low on some mix and I, they had a really good deal on. And I thought, you know, it'd be good.
[28:04.730 --> 28:09.870]  I'm really enjoying this. This is a lifestyle change. I'm just going to buy, I'm just going to
[28:09.870 --> 28:16.310]  buy some, uh, some pancake mix, assuming it would work with my waffle maker. And I kind of panic
[28:16.310 --> 28:24.450]  when they show only a few other items left. I buy all of them. 10 pounds? You bought 70 pounds
[28:24.450 --> 28:31.790]  of pancake mix? 10 pounds times 7? Did it come on a pallet? I haven't got it yet, but I bought 70
[28:31.790 --> 28:42.790]  pounds of pancake mix. Oh my God. I bought a child's worth of pancake mix. Dude, that's,
[28:42.790 --> 28:49.850]  that's like a, that's like a seven year old's worth of pancakes. Jesus. Here's what you do,
[28:49.910 --> 28:55.910]  man. You just get a hot, you just get yourself a hot plate and one pan and a flipper and spatula.
[28:56.290 --> 29:00.670]  And then you just make, you just make, just make waffles or make pancakes in your bathroom.
[29:02.470 --> 29:07.490]  Did you think it was ounces? Like what were you thinking? No, I knew it was 10 pounds,
[29:07.590 --> 29:11.410]  but it was a good deal. And they only had seven. So I thought if I buy it and I like it,
[29:11.410 --> 29:14.070]  I'll want more. And there's, what if they're gone? So I just bought them.
[29:14.550 --> 29:18.970]  Like the Krusty's company, it's limited edition pancake mix. They're like,
[29:19.010 --> 29:22.390]  oh, we're all out for 2020. You have to wait for next year's edition.
[29:22.950 --> 29:26.690]  How much was that? It was a good deal. It wasn't that much.
[29:29.210 --> 29:35.510]  The problem, the problem is I didn't know until after I paid for everything that they're
[29:35.510 --> 29:41.010]  different. And so I've been asking people, is this okay? And I'm getting answers all over the place.
[29:41.010 --> 29:44.730]  I've had people tell me it's going to break my waffle machine. Cause it's too gummy.
[29:44.850 --> 29:48.750]  I've had people tell me it's totally fine. It's all over the place.
[29:48.970 --> 29:53.550]  Well, have you considered just switching to pancakes considering you have 70 pounds of
[29:53.550 --> 29:58.450]  pancake mix? Great point, Gavin. Fantastic point. I thought that too. They don't make any cool
[29:58.450 --> 30:03.690]  pancake machines. I really like my turtles pancakes. No, there's zero turtles pancakes.
[30:04.070 --> 30:10.350]  It's a real, it's under saturated. You could sort of, uh, maybe get a piece of metal,
[30:10.830 --> 30:16.910]  like a brand for a cow that is turtles, and then just stab the top of your pancake when it's done.
[30:17.150 --> 30:20.850]  That seems like work though. The whole point, I'm making bathroom waffles. You
[30:20.850 --> 30:24.210]  think I want to add additional steps to this? This is all about convenience.
[30:25.670 --> 30:28.410]  70 pounds. Yeah, that's the thing. A lot of people have said, I don't know,
[30:28.450 --> 30:31.790]  just try it and see if the pancake mix thing works in the wall. Also, I don't know,
[30:31.830 --> 30:36.010]  am I making a waffle or a pancake at that point? I'm putting pancake mix in a waffle maker. Is
[30:36.010 --> 30:43.830]  that a waffle or a pancake? Your heart, your arteries. It's a waffled pancake. Okay.
[30:44.350 --> 30:48.710]  I've been calling it a waffle. The waffle is part of the process, right? You waffle something. So
[30:48.710 --> 30:55.650]  it's a waffled pancake. So you're pretty much teed up for another food challenge. I don't view it
[30:55.650 --> 31:01.510]  that way. This is just a daily joy. And hopefully the pancake mix works. Daily joy for what,
[31:01.510 --> 31:07.050]  two and a half years? How long is it going to take you to eat 70 pounds? That's the other problem.
[31:08.130 --> 31:13.970]  It's not 70 pounds of food. You're adding stuff to the mix. It's going to be way more than 70.
[31:14.230 --> 31:18.590]  You're going to be eating like 200 pounds of pancakes. I viewed this as like my lifetime
[31:18.590 --> 31:24.290]  supply of pancake waffle mix. I figured I'd be good for a long time. I'm never going to have
[31:24.290 --> 31:29.390]  to think about it again. It's fantastic. It's not like honey though. It's going to expire.
[31:29.390 --> 31:36.850]  I'm getting to that. It turns out that the Krusty's buttermilk pancake mix is best before
[31:36.850 --> 31:44.730]  six months from when they made it. So if I wanted to consume all of my pancake slash waffle
[31:45.390 --> 31:50.150]  within the time it was good, I need to eat a little bit more than 10 pounds a month.
[31:50.150 --> 32:00.850]  Of waffles. Could you make 70 pounds of pancaked or waffled pancakes and then freeze them?
[32:01.490 --> 32:06.750]  That doesn't seem... They'll keep for like a year and a half in the freezer.
[32:07.230 --> 32:11.830]  I guess that's what Eggo waffles are, right? Like Millie has Eggo waffles. That's a great point.
[32:12.050 --> 32:16.410]  Eggo waffles are a thing. She pulls them out of the freezer and sticks them in the fucking
[32:16.410 --> 32:22.230]  the toaster and boom. You need to open a kitchen or something. You're going to have to get rid
[32:22.230 --> 32:27.470]  of these by giving them away. Do you live with family? I mean, I could give them the family,
[32:27.690 --> 32:33.870]  but it's like once it's 70 pounds of mix that I was very excited about and has turned into a problem.
[32:34.190 --> 32:39.970]  What's crazy is this isn't an error. This is a fuckface. You've done this because you are you
[32:39.970 --> 32:44.930]  and it's funny. Oh, I was very excited when I made this order that this was a great decision.
[32:44.930 --> 32:49.030]  And then I woke up this morning and thought, I can't believe I bought 70 pounds of mix
[32:49.030 --> 32:53.990]  for a thing that might not turn out. These could be total shit. I'm going to have to try
[32:53.990 --> 32:58.990]  and see what it's like. I've never had a pancake mixed waffle. So I just don't understand the
[32:58.990 --> 33:04.870]  mindset of it being a good deal. Like anything in bulk is a good deal. You could buy 90 kilograms
[33:04.870 --> 33:11.450]  of toothpaste. It doesn't mean it's a good idea. You'd probably be way cheaper, but you've got to
[33:11.450 --> 33:16.210]  store that shit forever. Yeah, but then you just don't think about it. Imagine never having,
[33:16.310 --> 33:20.310]  if you're having a waffle a day and you all of a sudden just have to, you don't have to think
[33:20.310 --> 33:25.410]  about where the waffles are coming from. That's a big thing. That's a nice change. I used to be
[33:25.410 --> 33:31.130]  big into the bulk purchases. Like I once bought 200 rolls of toilet paper because I thought,
[33:31.190 --> 33:35.970]  you know, this doesn't go bad. I'll just wipe my ass forever. And that's all fun and games until
[33:35.970 --> 33:42.530]  you have to move house. And now I'm filling up like four moving boxes with just bulk roll. It's a
[33:42.530 --> 33:47.330]  terrible plan. Don't even get him started on the fucking boxes and boxes of salmon colored shorts
[33:47.330 --> 33:54.990]  he got off that truck. Another thing I asked, I went to Twitter about this and I thought I,
[33:55.430 --> 34:00.130]  Chef Mike is like the only chef I'm aware of that I know that might answer me. So I asked Chef Mike,
[34:00.350 --> 34:04.930]  he gave me a little, like he gave some insight, but then he also just said this. And I've got
[34:04.930 --> 34:10.010]  no fucking idea what that means. I have no clue how to translate. Surprisingly, ketchup will do
[34:10.010 --> 34:16.750]  the trick. Andrew Panton, surprisingly, ketchup. Is he saying add it to the batter? I don't know.
[34:16.870 --> 34:21.250]  I asked, would it work? And he's like, yeah, it's actually, it's fine. And then he just made a
[34:21.250 --> 34:25.470]  second tweet and said, surprisingly, ketchup will do the trick. I got no idea what that means. Where
[34:25.470 --> 34:30.050]  do I put the ketchup in the thing? Here's the deal with Chef Mike. I love Chef Mike. I think he's a
[34:30.050 --> 34:37.550]  great dude. Uh, big fan, consider him a friend, but all of his food advice always comes down to
[34:37.550 --> 34:42.250]  just make ice cream bread. And I don't know what that is, but if you ever get any advice from me,
[34:42.290 --> 34:45.470]  he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then, uh, then you make ice cream bread. He can say whatever he
[34:45.470 --> 34:49.750]  wants and people listen because he is a chef. That is what makes it confusing. If anyone else
[34:49.750 --> 34:53.830]  would have said, surprisingly, ketchup will do the trick, I would be unfazed and walk right by,
[34:53.910 --> 34:57.530]  but I have no idea what that means, but I assume it's a good tip. I started watching his YouTube
[34:57.530 --> 35:02.310]  videos. His shit looks delicious. Not his actual feces. His stuff, the stuff he makes looks damn
[35:02.310 --> 35:09.110]  good. It looks incredibly unhealthy too, which I guess is why it looks good. Was there any thought
[35:09.110 --> 35:14.130]  by anybody that Chef Mike's YouTube channel was him filming his shit? Did we need the clarification?
[35:15.170 --> 35:24.130]  Chef's Mike? Did you say Chef's Mike? I don't know what I said. I'm heated about these waffles and
[35:24.130 --> 35:29.350]  pancakes. I've got a lot going on. I'm really excited to see a picture of them when they arrive.
[35:30.050 --> 35:36.490]  Saturday. It won't take long. Oh, you know, Pancake Day is coming up. It's a poor fucking
[35:36.490 --> 35:43.410]  Amazon delivery guy. He's going to pull his back out, trying to take the pallet of pancakes out of
[35:43.410 --> 35:47.290]  his truck. He separated it into three different things. It'll be fine. It's not one 70 pound box
[35:47.290 --> 35:52.210]  of batter. Dude, Shrove Tuesday is in three months. I reckon that's your day. That's when you whip
[35:52.210 --> 35:56.290]  them all up. You give them out, walk out, give one to the woman in the alley. Everyone's going to
[35:56.290 --> 36:01.550]  be wanting pancakes. I don't think I could make 70 pounds of pancakes in a day. Not even with your
[36:01.550 --> 36:05.710]  bathroom set up? No, I don't think so. Even if I incorporated the tub, I think that's just not
[36:05.710 --> 36:11.130]  enough. The making of it, the time to cook. The tub? Are you going to mix it all in the bath? Well,
[36:11.270 --> 36:16.810]  if I'm making 70 pounds of fucking pancake mix and I'm in my bathroom, why wouldn't I utilize the tub
[36:16.810 --> 36:21.070]  at that point? I don't think the mixing stage is the bottleneck. I think it's the cooking them
[36:21.070 --> 36:26.090]  stage. But I just want... you need the rapid... I could just scoop. If I put it in the tub, I get my
[36:26.090 --> 36:30.430]  thing. I just scoop from the tub, pour it in the machine. It's way faster. You should get one of
[36:30.430 --> 36:36.030]  the ores left over from the bathtub races to mix it. And then you should... I don't use ores. That's
[36:36.030 --> 36:42.190]  absurd. You should... Okay. You should overnight like three more Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
[36:43.290 --> 36:48.230]  waffle makers so you can start mass producing these things. How many outlets do you have in
[36:48.230 --> 36:56.810]  your bathroom? Two. Okay. You're going to need some power strips. Because there's nothing safer
[36:56.810 --> 37:05.130]  than a power strip on the floor of a bathroom. If anyone has a waffle maker or pancake maker
[37:05.130 --> 37:08.990]  suggestion, feel free to send them to me. Well, I'm the market for a second maker.
[37:11.270 --> 37:16.610]  They make pancake machines. No, no, no. Andrew, let's think about it this way.
[37:16.610 --> 37:22.190]  What's the first part of the word pancake? Pan. Yeah. It's because it's made in a pan.
[37:22.770 --> 37:27.370]  There's not a pancake maker. It's just a pan. It's a cake in a pan. The first part of the word
[37:27.370 --> 37:32.230]  is waff, waff, and you don't make a fucking waffle in a waff. I don't get your point. That's not a
[37:32.230 --> 37:36.610]  word, waff! You're just saying you're putting three letters together and saying that's how you
[37:36.610 --> 37:41.390]  cook it. You definitely... There are pancake machines, you told me. The hotel. No, I said
[37:41.390 --> 37:48.790]  I said there are waffle machines. No. Oh, maybe you did. I've seen pancake. But pancake machines
[37:48.790 --> 37:54.510]  definitely exist. I've seen things that like will just squirt a circle and then they'll go
[37:54.510 --> 38:00.490]  through like a heater. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have to get like an industrial hotel pancake
[38:00.490 --> 38:05.370]  machine. Is the waffle machine the turtles one? Is it one of the ones that flips or does it just?
[38:05.970 --> 38:09.270]  No, no, you just pour it in, you close the lid, you're good to go. So you get an uneven
[38:09.270 --> 38:15.570]  cook, basically. The tops are going to be softer. It's worth it for the turtle. All right. Is that
[38:15.570 --> 38:21.690]  a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or a Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles waffle maker? I don't get
[38:21.690 --> 38:28.490]  that joke. What is that joke? When it was on in England originally, ninjas were too violent,
[38:28.930 --> 38:36.710]  I suppose. So they named it Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. And also there were no nunchucks or
[38:36.710 --> 38:42.370]  one of the characters weapons was cut. I didn't know that. Yeah, I actually for Christmas one
[38:42.370 --> 38:46.930]  year, I got Gavin a bunch of Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle merchandise. I had shipped it over from
[38:46.930 --> 38:51.730]  England as his present. It's true. I've still got that stuff. And they even changed, they like
[38:51.730 --> 38:57.130]  sung the theme tune twice with both versions. We're not allowed to play turtles theme tune on
[38:57.130 --> 39:04.670]  here, are we, Eric? I think it's a safe assumption now. He said no, absolutely not. Europe has very
[39:04.670 --> 39:10.830]  strict laws for like what type of content you could be producing on television or airing on
[39:10.830 --> 39:15.570]  television at certain times. Like one of my favorite sports stories of recent years was
[39:15.570 --> 39:20.810]  there is this MMA event called Bellator, which is like the second biggest promotion. And they were
[39:20.810 --> 39:27.390]  doing their first big show. And they had a card that was airing in London. I mean, Europe generally.
[39:27.790 --> 39:33.790]  And every single fight went wrong. There were no finishes. Every fight was as long as it possibly
[39:33.790 --> 39:37.850]  could, which they didn't project for in the scheduling. And they did it to accommodate
[39:37.850 --> 39:42.910]  North American time. So it went all night. And during the main event, the second round, I want
[39:42.910 --> 39:49.110]  to say the five round fight, they hit 7 a.m. where I guess it's you can't have violent content on at
[39:49.110 --> 39:55.090]  that time. So anyone watching in London immediately had the fight flipped from that to Peppa Pig,
[39:55.230 --> 40:00.630]  and they could not reverse it. So people had stayed up for hours watching this thing,
[40:00.630 --> 40:04.690]  and they finally get to the main event, and it flips to Peppa Pig in the middle of it,
[40:04.850 --> 40:08.710]  and they could not see it. Yeah, the Brits used to be, or maybe still are,
[40:09.210 --> 40:13.810]  pretty fussy about violence on the old television. So what does this have to do with Scientology?
[40:14.530 --> 40:19.150]  Oh, you sell waffles to the Scientologists? Yeah, I got to sell waffles to Scientologists.
[40:19.250 --> 40:22.890]  That's not the only thing. That's not the only change that has happened in my life since we
[40:22.890 --> 40:30.210]  last spoke. We took a week off last week. Because of the show. We did not record last week. From
[40:30.210 --> 40:34.950]  nothing to the people listening. But I missed you guys. I miss you guys a lot. I have a lot
[40:34.950 --> 40:41.130]  of fun doing these. I missed you guys. So I put a thing together, because it's so fun to do.
[40:41.270 --> 40:48.030]  It's a project I've been working on kind of on and off for over a month. I did some community
[40:48.030 --> 40:52.970]  casting. This is going to be an interesting podcast moment where we potentially listen to a
[40:52.970 --> 40:59.830]  podcast on a podcast. I miss you guys so much. I made a new podcast. Very original title.
[41:00.210 --> 41:05.430]  Called Fluke Face. It really is just, it came from the heart, because I missed you two a lot.
[41:05.510 --> 41:09.790]  I'm trying to, it's still working on getting it on Spotify and iTunes, because RSS feeds make
[41:09.790 --> 41:17.270]  zero sense. But we recorded an episode last week, one we would typically record. And I'll just...
[41:18.530 --> 41:22.270]  Did the image not load? Do you guys see the image? I can see it. I can see it. I see it.
[41:22.850 --> 41:28.290]  It's a fantastic piece of art that I had made. So here, if you want to listen to a little bit of
[41:28.290 --> 41:36.090]  this, what I did was, it's on SoundCloud at the moment. I transcribed our first episode. I had it
[41:36.090 --> 41:41.830]  transcribed. It's essentially word for word. And I casted three people to play us, and they read
[41:41.830 --> 41:45.770]  the script of our first episode. It's actually the first time I've ever listened to the show.
[41:45.950 --> 41:53.770]  Wasn't a bad first episode. A little slow. But that's Fluke Face. I got a friend of mine named
[41:53.770 --> 42:00.730]  Evan to be me. I casted a friend named Geoff with a J to play Geoff. And then I just tweeted,
[42:01.070 --> 42:07.130]  anyone have a British accent that I could use for a thing? And I took the first person who replied,
[42:07.730 --> 42:13.770]  a woman named Meg, and she did fantastic as Gavin. What if I'd have replied? That would
[42:13.770 --> 42:19.550]  have been weird, I guess. I think I would have cast you if you were first. Can I start playing
[42:19.550 --> 42:24.870]  this? Yeah, go ahead. You can listen to it. It's a thing. It is word for word,
[42:25.610 --> 42:30.010]  the transcript of our first episode. It's not the whole episode. It is the whole episode. Oh,
[42:30.050 --> 42:37.050]  I saw 104. I thought that was minutes. It's 104 hours? It is the first episode, and there's zero
[42:37.050 --> 42:42.490]  editing. There's zero editing, so there are some pauses. Instead of laughter, because that would
[42:42.490 --> 42:47.050]  be forced, whenever there's laughter and it's in the script, they just say laugh. And sometimes
[42:47.050 --> 42:52.170]  a person would miss their laugh, and then there would be a long pause where they're waiting for
[42:52.170 --> 42:58.470]  a laugh to happen. It happens a few times. I've got an honest question. Is this better than our
[42:58.470 --> 43:04.230]  original episode? I haven't listened to our actual original episode, so I don't know. I
[43:04.230 --> 43:11.930]  couldn't comment on that. Are you okay, Geoff? Yeah, I'm just kind of at a loss. I'd recommend
[43:11.930 --> 43:16.110]  giving it a little listen. It starts a little slow. I'd say it picks up maybe 15 minutes or
[43:16.110 --> 43:22.050]  so in. They get their footing, but it's quite good. Us too, by the way. The first 15 minutes of
[43:22.050 --> 43:26.550]  our first episode was a little rough. The person playing me has a really nice voice. Yeah,
[43:26.730 --> 43:31.230]  and Meg absolutely killed it. For literally being the first person who my casting was,
[43:31.290 --> 43:36.350]  you replied first, you can do it. Did amazing. How did you explain this? Were they just like,
[43:36.650 --> 43:40.490]  okay, I'm going to pause it now because I'm going to listen to this later. Were they just like,
[43:40.590 --> 43:43.990]  all right, yeah, makes sense? Or were they kind of questioning your motivation?
[43:44.390 --> 43:48.810]  Oh, no, everyone was on board. I knew two of the people already from a long time ago,
[43:48.890 --> 43:54.390]  and Meg was not hard to convince. Are you going to have them record episodes two through 16 and
[43:54.390 --> 43:59.850]  then all the 16s? I thought about it. That's a lot of work, though. I don't think anyone will
[43:59.850 --> 44:05.330]  actually listen to this. It was more of just an exercise of me missing you two and getting to
[44:05.330 --> 44:09.410]  continue to do the podcast. That's so sweet. That's really sweet. I missed you too. I was,
[44:09.410 --> 44:14.590]  honestly, and still am blown away that we moved the entire podcast for a shelf.
[44:15.810 --> 44:21.390]  We were discussing whether we were going to be filming or doing one this week, weren't we? And
[44:21.390 --> 44:26.750]  you and I had a little conversation on Slack, Andrew. Geoff said, I'm good for tomorrow. This
[44:26.750 --> 44:31.850]  was yesterday. I said, I'm okay for tomorrow, but my floor has some fluff on it and I need to vacuum.
[44:32.010 --> 44:37.070]  So maybe we should move the entire podcast. Andrew said, I also have concerns that a strong breeze
[44:37.070 --> 44:42.930]  might rattle my door. I'll check the weather reports and report back. Geoff said, your jokes
[44:42.930 --> 44:50.570]  mean nothing to me. It was a lot more than that, wasn't it? Also, you guys are acting like we took
[44:50.570 --> 44:55.430]  last week off for the shelves. We moved the podcast two days for the shelves. Last week,
[44:55.450 --> 45:03.050]  I was out of town. That's true. Yeah, it had nothing to do with the shelving. If you want
[45:03.050 --> 45:08.850]  a bitch that we had to move the podcast so that I could go to Detroit, you can do that.
[45:11.790 --> 45:15.850]  So this and the last one is the longest gap we've ever had between episodes.
[45:16.750 --> 45:21.470]  Because not only was it a week missed, it was two days earlier than normal.
[45:21.830 --> 45:25.770]  Then you know what? Since Gavin, you said a nice thing and Andrew, you obviously missed
[45:25.770 --> 45:29.790]  us terribly. I'm going to say for the purposes of this podcast, I missed you guys too.
[45:29.790 --> 45:33.210]  That's nice of you to say. For the purposes of this podcast, I'll say this is nice.
[45:33.590 --> 45:38.010]  Yeah, there you go. That's a nice thing. We're all friends. For the purposes of this podcast.
[45:38.910 --> 45:44.350]  I got to wrap up real soon just because I got to go trade in Gavin's car for a new car.
[45:45.550 --> 45:52.370]  You're getting rid of it? That's the uncomfortable part. If you don't know,
[45:52.450 --> 45:58.510]  Gavin won my car in a bet. I've had it for six years now.
[45:58.510 --> 46:03.370]  I got it quite soon after you bought it. It was within like three months.
[46:04.350 --> 46:09.410]  And I have to, I have to, it's time and I'm really sorry. But on the bright side,
[46:09.530 --> 46:12.910]  I guess the ownership transfers to you. So you're about to get a really nice new car.
[46:14.170 --> 46:17.290]  Dude, what does this mean for my tax return this year? Do I have to do it?
[46:18.050 --> 46:20.610]  I have no idea. We'll have to work that out with the lawyers.
[46:20.870 --> 46:22.810]  Oh, I'm excited that you're getting me a new car.
[46:23.010 --> 46:26.450]  I'm really sorry that I'm trading in your car without getting your permission.
[46:26.750 --> 46:28.150]  But it's pretty much a done deal.
[46:30.190 --> 46:32.170]  I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
[46:33.770 --> 46:37.350]  As soon as we, as soon as we hang up, I'm hopping in your old car
[46:37.350 --> 46:40.970]  and I'm driving it to South Austin to say goodbye to it.
[46:41.050 --> 46:45.090]  I, I really liked when I, when I owned that car and I still lived with you cause
[46:46.210 --> 46:51.030]  I'd walk by it like to get to my little studio. I'd walk past it and be like, that's my car.
[46:53.230 --> 46:59.490]  Oh, by the way, uh, by the way, Millie, uh, who is 15 and has a learner's permit,
[46:59.610 --> 47:05.650]  has driven your car now infinitely more times than you will ever drive that car or your new car.
[47:05.870 --> 47:12.790]  I gotta get a license. I can't have Millie beat me to a driver's license, right?
[47:12.810 --> 47:15.450]  You got like seven or eight months before you're fucked, buddy.
[47:15.550 --> 47:19.150]  Ah, easy. I'll be, I'll be driving before Andrew finishes his pancakes.
[47:19.390 --> 47:19.930]  Oh, definitely.
[47:26.170 --> 47:28.190]  Well, congrats. I'm happy for you.
[47:28.330 --> 47:33.870]  Oh, thanks. I'm just, I felt, I felt, I realized today when I was making the deal that I hadn't
[47:33.870 --> 47:40.330]  actually asked your permission to trade your car in. And I, I, I'm not lying. I was at the
[47:40.330 --> 47:44.630]  dealership going, Oh, I feel a little shitty about this. And I thought, Oh, I'll just,
[47:44.710 --> 47:47.170]  I'll just gloss over it really fast in the podcast and move on.
[47:49.130 --> 47:50.250]  Oh, that's amazing.
[47:50.250 --> 47:56.790]  Yeah. Uh, by the way, 2020, great time to, to put a bunch of money into buying a new car.
[47:57.150 --> 48:02.090]  Wouldn't, wouldn't be doing it if it was at all possible. But I gotta be honest with you, man,
[48:02.290 --> 48:05.950]  your car kind of fell apart this year. Kind of a piece of shit.
[48:06.910 --> 48:11.390]  Didn't it fall apart like a year ago as well? Like I feel like you've been dealing with this
[48:11.390 --> 48:12.890]  car dripping apart for ages.
[48:12.990 --> 48:18.290]  Your car's been a bit of an issue. Uh, what finally did it for me was two days ago,
[48:18.290 --> 48:23.230]  I went out to go run some errands and your car wouldn't start. And I had to call a guy,
[48:23.630 --> 48:27.050]  I was going to have him tow it. And, uh, he was like, no, no, no, it just needs to jump.
[48:27.110 --> 48:30.410]  Your battery's fine. So he jumped it. And I did every, I rode or drove it around for a couple
[48:30.410 --> 48:34.990]  hours to let the battery charge up. And then yesterday morning I woke up and, uh, went to,
[48:35.110 --> 48:40.290]  to similarly take your car to go run some errands and it was deader than dead.
[48:40.510 --> 48:43.530]  And I called the dude and I said, take it to the dealer. And then I
[48:43.530 --> 48:47.090]  just drove to another dealer. And I said, I'm going to buy a new car.
[48:47.090 --> 48:51.450]  I have a piece of shit at another dealership getting its battery replaced. I'm trading it in
[48:51.450 --> 48:56.110]  and I'm done with it. It was like two dead batteries in two days was too much for me.
[48:56.290 --> 48:59.990]  It proves how good a friend you are though, because you've put a lot of money into my car
[48:59.990 --> 49:05.610]  over the years. Dude, I had to put $10,000 into your car this summer and I'm never getting back
[49:06.150 --> 49:11.970]  when they had your car for two and a half months at the dealer. That was like, that was the straw
[49:11.970 --> 49:15.790]  that broke the camel's back when they had your car for two and a half months. And I took it in
[49:15.790 --> 49:19.630]  to get the air conditioner fixed, and it cost over $10,000. And then...
[49:20.250 --> 49:21.370]  Jesus, what a money pit.
[49:21.530 --> 49:27.490]  Then, oh, it's a huge... it was a perfect car for like five years. And then when it hit the wall,
[49:27.630 --> 49:33.710]  it just hit the wall super hard. And then yeah, the two dead batteries in two days was just too
[49:33.710 --> 49:39.370]  fucking much. I got that kind of mad where you don't yell or get angry. You just, your entire
[49:39.370 --> 49:44.910]  body catches on fire and you're burning and you get real calm. And I just, I took an Uber
[49:45.790 --> 49:50.530]  in the pandemic. I took an Uber to a dealer and I just walked around and I was like, I want that
[49:50.530 --> 49:55.150]  car. He was like, all right, man. There is something impressive about you,
[49:55.190 --> 50:00.230]  Geoff, that has been consistent the entire time I've known you. And that is, it takes you like
[50:00.230 --> 50:04.710]  10 seconds to buy a car. You will just be like, need a car. And then you'll just have one that
[50:04.710 --> 50:09.870]  day. You won't get any thought. You'll be like, oh, I want a, I want like a BMW. You come back
[50:09.870 --> 50:13.570]  with an Audi or something. It's like, oh, I didn't really want one that bad. How did you know I'm
[50:13.570 --> 50:21.950]  trading the Audi for a BMW? Are you following me? That's amazing. That's amazing. You like your
[50:21.950 --> 50:27.710]  German engineering. I do. I do. And you know, part of it is like, and part of it is in response to
[50:27.710 --> 50:33.490]  everybody that we know getting a Tesla. I just like, you just want to keep burning petrol. Yeah.
[50:33.510 --> 50:37.970]  I just want to roll coal all day long. No, I just, I just don't want to drive the same car as every
[50:37.970 --> 50:43.550]  single friend I have. I feel like I'm in some sort of a weird car club. I haven't seen a
[50:43.550 --> 50:49.390]  lot of Tesla roadsters. You can get one of them. Yeah. I'm just, I'll buy one. They're only like
[50:49.390 --> 50:56.370]  250 grand or something. I have a, I have a hate. Well, I'd listen. I, that's never going to happen.
[50:56.430 --> 51:01.070]  I'm never going to pay a house for a car. That's fucking ludicrous. I only buy used. I, when I buy
[51:01.070 --> 51:07.690]  your car, when I buy you new cars, I only get that. I'm buying you a very nice 2019. Maybe next week
[51:07.690 --> 51:15.730]  we could bet your house. Fucking hell. But, uh, no, I want to move. I want to join the electric revolution,
[51:15.730 --> 51:20.890]  but I just, Elon Musk is so gross. I just can't. You don't have to get a Tesla. There's loads of
[51:20.890 --> 51:25.610]  electric cars. Yeah, I know, but they're all pretty fucking expensive and I want to wait till like the
[51:25.610 --> 51:31.810]  next generation. Dude, have you guys seen, I'm not a fan of Hummers. Uh, I had to drive home these in
[51:31.810 --> 51:36.330]  the army. They are not fun. But, uh, that, have you guys seen the commercial for that new fucking
[51:36.330 --> 51:40.350]  Hummer that's coming out? That electric Hummer with a thousand horsepower that's coming out in
[51:40.350 --> 51:44.490]  like two years. You can already pre-order it. No, I can't remember the last time I saw a car commercial.
[51:44.750 --> 51:50.410]  It was on during the world series. It crab walks where it's fucking crazy. Watch the video. It's like
[51:50.410 --> 51:55.490]  it's science fiction. It moves all of its wheels? What? Yeah. Yeah. It like, it shows it trying to go up a hill
[51:55.490 --> 52:01.270]  and then it encounters a rock. And instead of like, it just drives sideways around the rock
[52:01.270 --> 52:05.410]  and then forward. It was, it's the fucking weirdest thing. So parallel parking is done. It's just
[52:05.410 --> 52:11.490]  perpendicular parking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent. That is exactly correct. Is that
[52:11.490 --> 52:14.970]  what you needed, Gavin? Is this the technology that has held you back from getting your license?
[52:15.150 --> 52:20.070]  Where you finally innovated to the point where you feel confident? I mean, parallel parking sucks ass.
[52:20.410 --> 52:25.250]  Especially on a hill. It's not, it's mechanically not that bad though, once you learn it. Well, I
[52:25.250 --> 52:30.430]  did learn to drive. I have done it. I just didn't get a license. Also, all the fucking cars now that
[52:30.430 --> 52:34.430]  come out like in the last two or three years, you just hit a button and it goes parking spot
[52:34.430 --> 52:42.950]  detected. Parking for you, idiot. Yeah. Maybe this is it. Maybe I just, I was just waiting for CarTech.
[52:43.370 --> 52:49.290]  Yeah. I think, I think CarTech has caught up with you. Finally. I wonder if you could use it to
[52:49.290 --> 52:54.710]  really violently change lanes. Yeah, there it is. The Hummer EV. Jesus Christ. It's like a side
[52:54.710 --> 52:59.730]  swipe in a video game. Like a kart racer. Just hit a button and it like launches to the other lane.
[53:00.090 --> 53:04.370]  That's way cooler than that Cybertruck. Oh, it is way cooler than the Cybertruck. Eric said
[53:04.370 --> 53:09.330]  it's like a, you can paint it like Halo or Saints Row. It is absolutely like the ludicrous vehicles
[53:09.330 --> 53:13.830]  you get in Saints Row three and four that just do dumb shit. Speaking of Saints Row, I didn't
[53:13.830 --> 53:19.570]  realize until I went to California the first time that those freaking like kneecapper things that
[53:19.570 --> 53:25.770]  stick out of rims are real. You could, people drive on the roads with those. Yeah. That, what, what's
[53:25.770 --> 53:30.950]  that about? What are they for? That's a thing here more than back home. Oh, I've seen them mainly in
[53:30.950 --> 53:36.810]  California. You, uh, you've seen Saints Row, right? Yeah. That's what they're for. Yeah, but
[53:36.810 --> 53:42.150]  how is that road legal? Like there are some laws about cars where it's like, well, you can't have
[53:42.150 --> 53:47.430]  a light, uh, this bright underneath the car door because of safety. But you can have a freaking
[53:47.430 --> 53:53.230]  spinning piece of metal that sticks out like a foot from the car? Insanity. No, no. Can I have
[53:53.230 --> 53:57.810]  an ejector seat? I think a lot of them are illegal, actually. And, uh, people just don't give a shit.
[53:57.810 --> 54:02.570]  Same way, like, you can only get your window tinted so dark, you know, but people don't care.
[54:02.670 --> 54:06.790]  They just blow through that and get it, like, limo tinted. And then, like, you play the percentages,
[54:06.950 --> 54:11.390]  like, what are the odds you're gonna get pulled over and get a tint? Is an ejector seat possible?
[54:12.270 --> 54:19.770]  Oh my god. That is absurd. Dude, Emily's dog is farting so bad I can't take it. Ugh.
[54:21.250 --> 54:25.430]  Have you done any fart cameo yet? Only Farts? Oh, I haven't started Only Farts yet. I need
[54:25.430 --> 54:29.990]  to get on that. I really do. When I was listening back to the other episode where Andrew was lying
[54:29.990 --> 54:35.970]  to our faces, or maybe it was the one after that, uh, you played a fart that was like broccoli and
[54:35.970 --> 54:40.010]  what was it? I don't know what it was. It was like two food items. It was like broccoli and
[54:40.010 --> 54:44.470]  brussels sprouts or something. But it sounded exactly like the double-barreled fart from the
[54:44.470 --> 54:50.690]  fart machine. You know, like that classic sound bank of farts. It was like, it was exactly like
[54:50.690 --> 54:54.890]  that. Thanks, man. That was, it was a good one. I've been having trouble capturing my farts lately.
[54:55.290 --> 54:59.730]  Actually, I've been thinking, I obviously don't have the technical expertise to do something like
[54:59.730 --> 55:06.650]  this, but if somebody out there does, I'm, I'm, I'm dealing with a real problem, which is when I
[55:06.650 --> 55:11.290]  realize I have one in the chamber, I get excited, right? And I hold it for a second and I go and I
[55:11.290 --> 55:16.470]  grab my phone and I have a, I, you know, swipe down to hit record, voice record. And then by the
[55:16.470 --> 55:20.750]  time I get it over to my butt, my butt gets like fart fear or something. And it's like, it's
[55:20.750 --> 55:25.830]  something psychological that I can't work out. And I'm having a real trouble, like seven out of
[55:25.830 --> 55:30.530]  10 times, if I, by the time I go through that process, which is very quick, my butt's like,
[55:30.670 --> 55:34.470]  no, I've changed my mind and it eats the fart and then I don't fart at all. Or it gives me like a
[55:34.470 --> 55:39.710]  really lame fart. I was thinking somebody should develop like a belt or something you can wear
[55:39.710 --> 55:44.830]  that essentially works like Xbox does when something cool happens in a video game and you
[55:44.830 --> 55:49.490]  hit the jewel and you go record the previous 30 seconds. Like you should be able to do that where
[55:49.490 --> 55:54.350]  you like rip an awesome fart out of the blue and then you can just like hit a button and it records
[55:54.350 --> 55:58.010]  the last 30 seconds of your butt. You can easily do that. Yeah, you just need like an audio recorder
[55:58.010 --> 56:03.610]  that has like a RAM buffer or something like a loop and then you can save your, backdate your farts.
[56:03.810 --> 56:07.470]  I was gonna say the technology exists and it's not in belts. I don't know why you're thinking
[56:07.470 --> 56:11.410]  about belts for this. Well, I don't want to put it in my butt, but. No, you have pockets.
[56:11.970 --> 56:16.070]  You certainly have pockets. Yeah, I don't know if that would muffle the fart sound. I, listen,
[56:17.130 --> 56:22.030]  it's, you guys both sound really smart and really clever. I will be the first person to sign up for
[56:22.030 --> 56:27.890]  your GoFundMe. I think the answer is boxes with like an additional layer of fabric and between
[56:27.890 --> 56:35.750]  your arsehole layer and the outer layer sits a small condenser mic and we'll just plug it into
[56:35.750 --> 56:40.870]  something in your pocket. I will donate a thousand dollars to your GoFundMe if you can get that made.
[56:41.050 --> 56:44.790]  Why am I making it? Because you're the one that had the brilliant idea, the dual layered
[56:44.790 --> 56:50.590]  fucking fart mic thing. I presented the problem and you're coming up with the solution. You're a,
[56:50.810 --> 56:55.530]  like, you, like, look at what you did with Slow Mo Guys. I have the ultimate faith that you can do,
[56:55.650 --> 57:01.210]  you could make this fart mic. The refart is what you, I don't, you don't have to call it that.
[57:01.250 --> 57:03.750]  You can call it whatever you want. You're a clever kid. I don't know. I feel like I'm more
[57:03.750 --> 57:07.250]  of an ideas man than a maker. I feel like Andrew, the one with the, uh, you know, the kitchen
[57:07.250 --> 57:11.150]  bathroom. He's the innovator here with the, with the tech. That's a good point. I think we should,
[57:11.150 --> 57:16.030]  we could combine forces. How about this? Gavin and I will be the money men. We will be the
[57:16.030 --> 57:22.670]  silent partners that fund your, uh, very unsilent machine. The problem is I don't like pants. I'm
[57:22.670 --> 57:27.910]  not a pants guy. So this is, this goes against my, my moral code. Eric says we're the silent
[57:27.910 --> 57:33.730]  fartners. I don't own any pairs of pants. I don't like pants. You don't wear pants.
[57:33.950 --> 57:37.530]  Well, you wear shorts only? Shorts only. Always. Yeah, but you still have to wear underwear.
[57:37.850 --> 57:41.310]  Oh yeah, but I don't know what that has to do with pants. Oh, I guess. What if it's,
[57:41.470 --> 57:45.970]  what if it's five degrees outside? In my head, I was still thinking the belt idea. I had forgotten
[57:45.970 --> 57:50.270]  that we'd moved on to the underwear system. Well no, you said it would go through the pants.
[57:50.750 --> 57:54.630]  That's what my confusion was. You said the charge would loop through the pants. I guess
[57:54.630 --> 57:57.210]  that could be shorts. It doesn't have to be pants. Yeah, just cut a hole in the pocket.
[57:57.910 --> 58:03.390]  Yeah, you'll figure it out. You're smart. Why don't you, you, do you wear boxes? Yeah. Okay.
[58:03.810 --> 58:07.050]  I don't know what you have against, you live in Canada too. Don't you want to have like,
[58:07.530 --> 58:11.370]  warm shins occasionally? Nah, it's fine. I don't mind the cold shins. I just, it's
[58:11.870 --> 58:16.590]  claustrophobic. I don't like pants. It's a lot of work. Pants are so much more work than shorts.
[58:17.130 --> 58:21.810]  It makes no sense. Why would anyone go with pants? You have to get them hemmed. I would assume
[58:21.810 --> 58:26.830]  weather. You have to get them hemmed. Who's buying, who's buying trousers with the bottoms
[58:26.830 --> 58:31.530]  unhemmed? You gotta, there's adjustments. I always feel like there's a whole process with pants. You
[58:31.530 --> 58:34.950]  buy the pants, they don't quite fit right. You have to go, you have to take them to a person,
[58:34.950 --> 58:39.290]  they put pins in the pants. It's a whole thing. Just buy shorts. I'll go one up.
[58:39.910 --> 58:45.470]  Shorts are worthless. Buy fucking, buy swim trunks. Then you're ready, then you're ready
[58:45.470 --> 58:49.950]  for a pool party. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. I like that. Do you only
[58:49.950 --> 58:54.150]  buy like, suit trousers? Why are you getting these? Just buy a pair of jeans or something.
[58:54.570 --> 58:59.370]  I've never bought jeans. I don't know. They're pretty, pretty simple. You buy the jeans and
[58:59.370 --> 59:04.130]  you put them on. If you need a belt, you wear that too. I want to figure out a way to fund the
[59:04.770 --> 59:11.650]  Andrew's big day where he wakes up and he puts on his first pair of blue jeans and then eats eggs.
[59:11.970 --> 59:16.510]  That sounds terrible. And then we'll do like four other things. We'll do four other things you've
[59:16.510 --> 59:21.250]  never done. It'll be like Andrew's one big day where he tries all the stuff he's never tried.
[59:21.950 --> 59:28.330]  Like jeans. Andrew, you're getting... Like denim. You're getting weirder by the week. This was a
[59:28.330 --> 59:33.370]  weird one for you. It was great content. There was three really weird things you said this episode.
[59:33.370 --> 59:37.630]  I think all of them are reasonable. And if you attempt them, what were the weird things? The
[59:37.630 --> 59:43.150]  waffle thing. I think if you tried a breakfast waffle from your room setup, you'd be on board.
[59:43.490 --> 59:49.290]  It's a great idea. I don't have the space to put... I got like no surfaces. Waffle makers aren't big.
[59:49.730 --> 59:53.350]  You just need a counter. I'm probably going to move it to my end table. I'm going to sleep next
[59:53.350 --> 59:56.530]  to my waffle machine. You've got like toothbrush and like toothpaste and a razor. Yeah, move it
[59:56.530 --> 01:00:00.190]  out of the bathroom. You don't even need it in the bathroom. Just put it in your room somewhere.
[01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:04.590]  Dude, you know what you should do while you're at it? You should figure out a way to tie your
[01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:09.430]  waffle maker to your alarm clock. So like five minutes before your alarm goes off,
[01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:13.710]  it turns on the waffle maker and it starts cooking your waffle. And then you probably
[01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:18.150]  get woken up by the smell even before the alarm. This is totally doable. How do I get the mix in?
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:22.870]  Well, you can pre-pour it the night before. That seems like it would be bad. Wouldn't it be
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:27.450]  terrible, the mix? I don't feel like the mix would last. Wrap the whole thing in like a cellophane
[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:33.170]  bag or something. Once again, the key thing with all my ideas is lack of effort. You're
[01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:38.630]  adding effort to this. It ruins. It's not adding effort. You're putting the mix in either way.
[01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:43.370]  Just try it. I bet it keeps overnight. No, but he's saying to put a bag in it. He's done. Don't
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:47.810]  put a bag in it. That was a joke suggestion. Before you go to bed. Fucking do it tonight,
[01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.090]  Andrew. Do it in your bathroom. Before you go to bed, pour some waffle mix in, go to sleep,
[01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:55.550]  wake up in the morning, click it on, do a taste test, see how it compares to a fresh waffle,
[01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:59.690]  see if there's a difference. Okay, I'll live dangerously. It's just waffle mix and water,
[01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.430]  right? That's all you're doing? Yeah, it's just waffle mix and water. Yeah,
[01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:06.490]  so I don't think that the water is going to activate it in a way that's going to make it go
[01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:10.010]  bad. Yeah, I think this is doable. You could even, if you don't want to have it to an alarm,
[01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:13.990]  you could put it on one of those like smart switches with a phone app and you just flick
[01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:17.950]  it on with your phone when you wake up. That is a great idea. Yeah. I think that would be a
[01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:22.770]  practical way of doing it. I have one more thing I feel like I should say before we advance.
[01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:26.890]  Don't go and sell my car though. It'll be brief. It's just a quick,
[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:32.150]  it's a quick thing. It was another big life change. And this one, it hurts my soul to report this.
[01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:38.670]  I am no longer a judge. I've been, I've been stripped of my judging abilities.
[01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:45.310]  That was short lived. It was very short lived. Oh, it goes deep though. So one night after the
[01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:49.910]  podcast came out, which I revealed, I had joined the judges that I lived amongst them.
[01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:55.970]  I received a random email. I'll just read it word for word from one Blake Longfellow. Greetings.
[01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:01.090]  It has come to our attention that you have entered into the hired judge pool of judges
[01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:07.510]  with dishonorable intentions. This dishonor is evident in your self-evaluation of yourself as
[01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:12.950]  an A grade judge in every single category, despite probably not knowing what most of
[01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:17.190]  these events are. The hired judge staff pride ourselves in providing high quality judges
[01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:21.810]  for competitions across the country, and it has been deemed that you do not meet the criteria
[01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:27.550]  for judge assignment. Thus you will be, then it just ends. We wish you and the whole F*** Face
[01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:33.670]  crew the best of luck in your future endeavors. Best regards, Blake Longfellow, hired judge founder.
[01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:40.030]  So that was upsetting. Like the main guy, even though he knows who you are from F*** Face.
[01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:45.710]  Yeah. He still stripped you of your judge-dom. No tolerance for it at all. I was hurt. It was a
[01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:50.350]  personal hurt. So you just lied on the test? You just aced the test? Oh, it says you can give
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:55.230]  yourself your own evaluation. So yeah, I just put an A for everything. And I said that in the episode.
[01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:59.150]  So I thought, I guess he heard it. And you know what? That's whatever. I think it would have been
[01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:03.930]  fun to keep me there. I think I'm a good judge, but they stripped me. Now here's the real controversy.
[01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:11.990]  I got sources in the judging. I got ears everywhere and hiredjudge.com. And I got sent another email.
[01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:18.210]  What happened? It wasn't that he listened and he found out about it. We have a rat. Somebody ratted
[01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:24.910]  to him directly and told him that I had snuck in. A listener? A listener emailed in. This is what a
[01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:31.310]  listener said. A user named Andrew Panton recently, and then in quotations, became a judge on your
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:37.670]  website. He is from a semi-popular podcast called F*** Face and recently had a dispute that was
[01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:43.430]  solved by one of the judges on your site. He is a sneaky little eel and often does things like this.
[01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:48.190]  Lying to get his way onto a website such as yours clearly goes against the principles you stand for.
[01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:53.630]  So I suggest you kick and block him. Feel free to let him know who reported him too. It'll make
[01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:58.770]  podcast content. Either way, he shouldn't be able to abuse your website for his own selfish
[01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:04.730]  and dishonorable purposes. If he's already been reported, feel free to ignore this. Have a good
[01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:11.450]  day. F*** Face fan won't say their name. You've been stabbed in the back by a fan with the
[01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:17.330]  pencil you refuse to eat. Dude, that's definitely a pencil guy, isn't it? That's a pencil. That is
[01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:23.470]  that is an upset. Yes, that is an upset pencil guy. Blake replied, thank you for bringing this
[01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:29.070]  to our attention. We're familiar with Andrew and his dishonorable antics. He has been removed from
[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:33.970]  all hired judge databases of judges and will be marked on our blacklist. So I'm on the hired
[01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:39.690]  blacklist. I went from I went from the highest standing of judge to being blacklisted from the
[01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:44.950]  entire community. What do you what do you think the chances are that that blacklist has one name
[01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:53.030]  on it? Oh, very high. Very high. I don't even know. Can you have a list of one? I think overall,
[01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:57.290]  that's awesome news, though, that we're semi popular. That's great. Yeah, I'll take that.
[01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:01.630]  I'm glad you could take that from that. I'm in shambles over here. No longer honorable.
[01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:05.850]  Still going to call myself honorable, but the official title is gone. I feel like that was a
[01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:11.830]  great podcast. There's no better way to end it than, you know, the loss of Andrew's judgehood.
[01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:17.170]  There's also one more loss that I'd like to mention, Andrew, is that someone beat your final
[01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:22.670]  Garfield time, it seems. I saw that. I didn't know that. And that's the one that you were like,
[01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:28.890]  no one's ever getting that one. Yeah. You think there's a reason I fell to waffle the breakfast
[01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:34.170]  waffles every day? I went to a dark place, Gavin, between the judge stripping my title
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:37.910]  and losing Garfield. It's been a rough time, but the waffles are bringing me back.
[01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:46.030]  I don't think you should stand for that, Andrew. I think you should bin your waffles.
[01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:49.290]  You should get back into Garfield and smash everyone back.
[01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:54.370]  The greatest origin story ever of a guy just throwing his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
[01:05:54.370 --> 01:06:00.490]  waffle maker off his balcony. Take your 70 pounds of waffle mix and dump it in the nearest harbor.
[01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:04.870]  You're going to make like a Rocky montage with the 70 pounds of waffle mix.
[01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.950]  You should trade it for lasagna. Get back in that game, buddy.
[01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:13.270]  Yeah, I never really liked lasagna. It's probably a thing I shouldn't admit. Never,
[01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:18.570]  never really into it. It's okay. It's just okay. It's all right. I think I think a good ravioli
[01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:23.390]  kicks a lasagna's ass any day of the week. But I would. I'm not going to. I'm not going to kick
[01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:29.330]  lasagna out of bed. I don't think I've had a ravioli. God, we'll put it on the jeans egg day.
[01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:35.910]  We got to have like the first day if we ever record this podcast in real life together,
[01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:40.770]  all three of us as friends, we should just have a food episode where you eat all the shit you've
[01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:44.710]  never eaten that is normal for people to eat. And we'll just get your opinions on them.
[01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:48.890]  Okay, gooseberries. Yeah, gooseberries. I'll bring the gooseberries. I'll bring you a turnip root.
[01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:53.710]  A gooseberry looks like a grape that wants to be a melon. It was a very confusing photo.
[01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:58.890]  It's like a sour, hairy grape. It seems very confused in what it wants to be.
[01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:05.410]  All right, well, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go get rid of Gavin's car. Okay. Goodbye, old friend.
[01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:09.850]  Don't worry, you're getting a shiny new car that you'll like even more, I promise.
[01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:15.650]  Ah, does it have any good features? The new one? It's got everything to 2013. No,
[01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:18.770]  it doesn't have that. But it's got all the features that were invented in the last seven
[01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:23.850]  years that the 2013 didn't have. Sweet. Well, that'll do it for F*** Face. Don't forget to
[01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:27.850]  check out store.roosterteeth.com or the description below to get the new GERPL shirt.
[01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.650]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, GERPL came out. We should have talked about GERPL.
[01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:36.230]  Like, comment, and subscribe. Tell a friend about F*** Face. It's a podcast that's really hard to
[01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:41.290]  describe, and when people say, what is this? You just go, I'm not... I don't know. So, check it
[01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:46.710]  out, and we'll see you next time. Hey, Eric, can I have a freaking shirt at some point? Can I get
[01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:54.410]  the GERPL? Can I get the F*** Face shirt? Yeah, I've asked the store team again to send them,
[01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:58.450]  so hopefully there's one this week. Sweet. So, you seemed really mad about that,
[01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:02.890]  but I was already taking care of it. So, we'll see you next time on F*** Face. Bye.
