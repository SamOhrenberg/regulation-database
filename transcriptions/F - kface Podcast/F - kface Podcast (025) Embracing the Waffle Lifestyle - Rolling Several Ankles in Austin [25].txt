[00:30.000 --> 00:33.220]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[01:10.550 --> 01:16.710]  And they would monitor your heart rate. And you had to keep your heart rate within a certain area
[01:16.710 --> 01:21.930]  to continue to make money. And John McEnroe would like serve tennis balls at you while you sat in
[01:21.930 --> 01:27.030]  the chair, trying to make you more scared. Or like they'd just drop a bunch of snakes next to your
[01:27.030 --> 01:32.970]  chair. You'd have to sit there and answer questions about like, who is the second president? It was a
[01:32.970 --> 01:35.190]  great show. So are you recording right now, Andrew?
[01:35.490 --> 01:37.870]  Oh yeah. That's what I'm talking about. I'm looking at the bars.
[01:37.870 --> 01:39.210]  Are you recording, Geoff?
[01:39.550 --> 01:46.250]  Yeah. So I guess the podcast already started. Here's what happened. We didn't record for a week,
[01:46.310 --> 01:53.530]  which I would love to get into. Also, by the way, I have decided to provide Nick today with pictures
[01:53.530 --> 01:57.690]  of the shelves. I took them before the podcast and I will be putting them in Discord in a second.
[01:58.450 --> 02:00.310]  Because I feel like Nick deserves to see them.
[02:00.730 --> 02:02.030]  Why Nick before us?
[02:02.390 --> 02:03.670]  You'll see it at the same time.
[02:04.190 --> 02:07.230]  Yeah, but you really seemed excited to show Nick and not the rest of us.
[02:07.230 --> 02:08.090]  I like Nick.
[02:08.590 --> 02:13.470]  I mean, it depends, too. I feel like Nick has been asking. I don't think any of us have been asking.
[02:13.810 --> 02:14.690]  No, I was asking.
[02:15.050 --> 02:18.210]  I don't remember you asking. Nick has definitely been the voice of the shelves.
[02:18.610 --> 02:21.130]  You weren't even in one of the episodes. Your power went off.
[02:21.250 --> 02:22.290]  I listened to that one, though.
[02:22.590 --> 02:28.470]  Well, here's what's happened post that. It's infected all of us, apparently. I logged in.
[02:28.530 --> 02:35.290]  Andrew was going strong. I was having immediate feedback issues where I'm getting your levels
[02:35.290 --> 02:39.910]  in my audition for some reason. Then Gavin couldn't... we couldn't hear him.
[02:40.590 --> 02:44.830]  And then as soon as Gavin eventually got back in and Nick verified that my shit works okay,
[02:45.150 --> 02:48.290]  Andrew got an error message and his shit broke.
[02:48.550 --> 02:52.110]  Yeah, I had to close Discord. And when I opened it again, it tried to update,
[02:52.510 --> 02:59.070]  but it couldn't find itself. And it threw up about 97 error messages that took me forever to close.
[02:59.390 --> 03:03.910]  And then I realized, it sat down finally, got it all working, took a sip of my cup of tea that
[03:03.910 --> 03:08.630]  I've just made, and it's rank. I've got a really disgusting cup of tea in front of me,
[03:09.270 --> 03:12.250]  and it's my only source of caffeine now for the entire show.
[03:12.510 --> 03:14.010]  How did that happen? What's wrong?
[03:14.110 --> 03:19.270]  I think, you know, if you don't like run a tap for a bit, it gets a little bit sort of,
[03:19.630 --> 03:22.810]  this water's been sat in the pipe for a week sort of taste to it.
[03:22.930 --> 03:23.890]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:23.890 --> 03:26.590]  But I boiled that, and now I've got like that, but hot.
[03:26.830 --> 03:28.330]  Austin tap water stinks.
[03:28.530 --> 03:29.010]  It's rank, man.
[03:29.010 --> 03:31.110]  One of the worst tap waters I've ever had.
[03:31.130 --> 03:31.730]  It's terrible.
[03:31.730 --> 03:32.010]  It's so bad.
[03:32.010 --> 03:32.970]  All right, listen.
[03:34.330 --> 03:35.290]  It's... all right.
[03:35.590 --> 03:36.390]  No, there's no defense.
[03:36.430 --> 03:39.110]  Why am I trying to defend Austin's tap water?
[03:39.310 --> 03:40.410]  No, you don't need to, it's fine.
[03:40.930 --> 03:43.970]  Sometimes, I don't know, I don't know, what am I doing? Who am I?
[03:44.030 --> 03:45.170]  Fucking shut up, idiot.
[03:45.190 --> 03:45.810]  Shut up, tea.
[03:46.150 --> 03:46.810]  What are you doing?
[03:47.210 --> 03:47.570]  Goddammit.
[03:47.630 --> 03:49.610]  But yeah, on occasion...
[03:50.390 --> 03:51.810]  God, I feel like I got to stand up for Austin.
[03:52.110 --> 03:53.270]  On occasion...
[03:53.270 --> 03:53.530]  It sucks.
[03:53.890 --> 03:54.510]  It smells.
[03:54.830 --> 03:56.270]  Yeah, or it gets this like blue algae stuff.
[03:56.270 --> 03:57.410]  It doesn't taste good ever.
[03:57.570 --> 03:59.270]  I don't give a fuck if it smells occasionally.
[03:59.470 --> 04:00.470]  It never tastes good.
[04:00.650 --> 04:01.670]  It mostly tastes fine.
[04:01.670 --> 04:03.290]  I use a Brita filter.
[04:03.910 --> 04:05.230]  Yeah, you're wrong, you're wrong.
[04:05.730 --> 04:07.870]  I've... Andrew, do you drink out of the tap where you live?
[04:07.910 --> 04:09.230]  Always, constantly.
[04:09.530 --> 04:10.370]  No filter needed.
[04:10.770 --> 04:14.350]  Samurai used to live just delicious, straight out of the tap, just guzzling it all day.
[04:14.690 --> 04:17.070]  This stuff here is bizarre.
[04:17.430 --> 04:20.910]  And a lot of people here who grew up here just drink it and think that's what water tastes like.
[04:21.150 --> 04:25.650]  Which I think is why so many people drink like Big Red and shit.
[04:26.050 --> 04:27.230]  Big Red is terrible too.
[04:27.550 --> 04:27.970]  What?
[04:28.450 --> 04:32.190]  It's just, it's like an overcompensation of the shitty tap water.
[04:32.370 --> 04:34.250]  It's like a million bags of sugar and red dye.
[04:34.650 --> 04:36.970]  There's no like, there's no taste to that beyond sweet.
[04:37.110 --> 04:39.170]  What you just described sounds delicious.
[04:39.510 --> 04:40.110]  Nah, it's not.
[04:40.470 --> 04:41.090]  It's not.
[04:41.710 --> 04:45.890]  Maybe the tap water here is poisoned so that people drink the fizzy drinks.
[04:46.110 --> 04:47.130]  That's a great point.
[04:47.590 --> 04:50.810]  I will say, in defense of Big Red, the one time I had it,
[04:50.850 --> 04:53.470]  I had like two bottles and then I vomited later that day.
[04:54.070 --> 04:55.110]  Fantastic puke color.
[04:55.410 --> 04:56.070]  It was a great red.
[04:56.070 --> 04:58.910]  I have a serious, serious question for you, Andrew.
[04:59.090 --> 04:59.370]  Go ahead.
[04:59.450 --> 05:00.930]  How often do you throw up?
[05:02.150 --> 05:02.950]  Oh, okay.
[05:02.970 --> 05:03.910]  You want to get into this?
[05:04.150 --> 05:04.650]  This is good.
[05:05.130 --> 05:08.370]  I had a fear of vomiting for years.
[05:08.370 --> 05:13.270]  Like when I was like eight or nine, I had bad Chinese food and I vomited up a bunch of Chinese
[05:13.270 --> 05:14.390]  food and it was horrible.
[05:14.830 --> 05:16.990]  So then I had a fear of vomiting for a long time.
[05:16.990 --> 05:19.210]  Was that like a mesophobia or something?
[05:19.330 --> 05:19.690]  Was it cool?
[05:19.750 --> 05:21.250]  I have no idea what it's called.
[05:21.330 --> 05:23.030]  I just really didn't want to ever do it.
[05:23.110 --> 05:23.950]  It was a whole problem.
[05:23.950 --> 05:29.530]  But then I went through this phase where I kept getting signed up for like these exercise classes
[05:29.530 --> 05:34.550]  and I would vomit at the end of every class and I was doing like two or three a week.
[05:35.010 --> 05:40.170]  So I just quickly it went from like a thing I was scared of to I'm an all time great vomiter.
[05:40.370 --> 05:40.990]  I'm loud.
[05:41.230 --> 05:42.150]  I'm efficient.
[05:42.650 --> 05:45.990]  I'm really good at vomiting and it was fantastic.
[05:46.490 --> 05:51.270]  One of the classes was me and these two women who were like in their 40s and they just they
[05:51.270 --> 05:52.830]  like kind of flirting with the trainer.
[05:52.830 --> 05:54.730]  They were just having a great time.
[05:55.470 --> 05:55.870]  No, no.
[05:55.930 --> 05:56.750]  This was like a gym.
[05:56.870 --> 05:57.830]  Like I'm going to a gym.
[05:58.090 --> 05:58.830]  This is a trainer.
[05:58.990 --> 05:59.730]  This is like a class.
[05:59.790 --> 06:00.610]  This wasn't a school thing.
[06:01.030 --> 06:05.070]  So it's these two like 40 year olds and they kind of like flirt the trainer and just like
[06:05.070 --> 06:08.710]  talk about wine they liked and like they were super buddy buddy.
[06:09.130 --> 06:12.390]  And then I had absolutely nothing in common with them at all.
[06:12.470 --> 06:16.870]  I was just the worst third wheel ever and I would constantly vomit so they couldn't
[06:16.870 --> 06:17.770]  have liked me less.
[06:18.310 --> 06:21.410]  And there was this one time where I had the vibe.
[06:21.410 --> 06:23.650]  Oh, I couldn't have killed the vibe more.
[06:23.930 --> 06:25.190]  I was the complete vibe killer.
[06:25.590 --> 06:30.730]  But there's this one time I drank like a strawberry protein shake before I went.
[06:31.190 --> 06:32.310]  And that was also like we did.
[06:32.370 --> 06:33.250]  These stairs were outside.
[06:33.330 --> 06:34.310]  We typically wouldn't be outside.
[06:35.050 --> 06:41.550]  And I walked like five feet after doing them and just the largest projectile vomit I've
[06:41.550 --> 06:42.110]  ever had.
[06:42.130 --> 06:43.310]  And they could all see.
[06:43.530 --> 06:46.490]  And it is bright like strawberry red.
[06:46.750 --> 06:48.550]  And these women were terrified.
[06:49.030 --> 06:50.110]  They were so frightened.
[06:50.110 --> 06:51.350]  And I'm a loud vomiter.
[06:51.510 --> 06:55.610]  I'm like, it's a lot of like, like, it's very loud.
[06:55.830 --> 06:57.390]  It was fantastic.
[06:57.770 --> 07:02.030]  Because I feel like when I've rarely talked to you outside of this podcast, usually on
[07:02.030 --> 07:04.450]  Slack or something, you'll be telling me a story.
[07:04.770 --> 07:06.690]  And you'd be like, yeah, yeah, I threw up all over myself.
[07:06.850 --> 07:08.050]  And then the story continues.
[07:08.110 --> 07:12.410]  And like the vomit part is usually like a side issue to the main story.
[07:12.510 --> 07:16.250]  And it's most of your stories involve you chunking somewhere.
[07:16.750 --> 07:18.750]  I feel like the ratio might be off.
[07:18.750 --> 07:22.070]  I think it's just maybe such a memorable aspect of something I tell.
[07:22.170 --> 07:23.590]  I don't vomit that often.
[07:24.050 --> 07:24.770]  It's been a while.
[07:24.910 --> 07:25.610]  Sounds like you do.
[07:25.930 --> 07:28.870]  I thought last time I vomited, I think was three weeks ago.
[07:29.450 --> 07:31.490]  I don't know why we're talking about that.
[07:31.590 --> 07:32.650]  That's pretty recent, dude.
[07:32.810 --> 07:35.970]  It is recent, but I'm saying before that it would have been months.
[07:36.270 --> 07:38.890]  How many times a year on average do you vomit?
[07:39.270 --> 07:40.730]  Maybe two or three.
[07:41.130 --> 07:43.690]  Gavin, how many times a year on average do you vomit?
[07:44.350 --> 07:45.230]  Maybe twice.
[07:45.370 --> 07:48.330]  But I do have to add that the last time I vomited was yesterday.
[07:48.830 --> 07:49.750]  There you go.
[07:50.190 --> 07:51.670]  Well, we need to get into that.
[07:51.950 --> 07:56.610]  I would say since I got sober, I average zero times a year vomiting.
[07:57.090 --> 07:58.530]  Why are you guys puking so much?
[07:58.870 --> 07:59.870]  Twice a year, isn't it?
[07:59.870 --> 08:02.270]  I mean, that's like I ate something bad once, probably.
[08:02.570 --> 08:03.630]  Did you eat something bad yesterday?
[08:04.010 --> 08:05.270]  No, but my cat did.
[08:05.390 --> 08:12.210]  Boy, at like 4am, he started making that sort of drain clog noise in his throat and started
[08:12.210 --> 08:13.790]  chunking all over the floor.
[08:14.450 --> 08:19.770]  And it was this thing, he does it sometimes where, like he's a cat, so he'll sometimes
[08:19.770 --> 08:20.830]  just chunk up what he ate.
[08:21.310 --> 08:25.930]  But he sometimes does this thing where he chunks up literal shit, like he will shit
[08:25.930 --> 08:26.850]  out of his mouth.
[08:27.290 --> 08:31.250]  It looks like turd, it smells like turd, like an absolute biohazard.
[08:31.530 --> 08:34.730]  And we took him to the vet after the first time and it was fine, apparently.
[08:35.130 --> 08:37.050]  Is he eating shit when you're not looking?
[08:37.050 --> 08:44.370]  No, he's just vomiting like severely digested something, food, to the point where it's just
[08:44.370 --> 08:45.330]  like brown paste.
[08:47.570 --> 08:55.230]  And I was cleaning up, I was cleaning up, but Meg was asleep, so I was trying to clean
[08:55.230 --> 08:56.110]  it up without gagging.
[08:56.190 --> 09:01.170]  So I was like stifling my gags while I was smearing up all this shit in the dark.
[09:01.470 --> 09:05.190]  And eventually I just had to get up, walk to a different room and throw up because the
[09:05.630 --> 09:07.430]  stifling had started to hurt my stomach.
[09:07.550 --> 09:10.050]  And it was every time I looked at the poo, I was almost vomiting.
[09:10.150 --> 09:11.010]  So I just had to get it out.
[09:12.410 --> 09:13.210]  That's hideous.
[09:13.910 --> 09:18.190]  So I will say, Andrew, in defense of what you were talking about, this is my aside,
[09:18.370 --> 09:24.590]  is when I was when I was in the army way back many, many years ago, I was in the fast
[09:24.590 --> 09:29.510]  running group and our drill sergeant, this is in like basic and journalism school and
[09:29.510 --> 09:34.090]  stuff, and my drill sergeant would not let us stop running until we vomited.
[09:34.090 --> 09:38.530]  So he said, until you throw up, you don't run hard enough.
[09:38.970 --> 09:42.410]  And so I threw up six days a week for eight months.
[09:42.650 --> 09:43.930]  That's so bad.
[09:43.990 --> 09:47.830]  Because I was not allowed to not throw up.
[09:47.970 --> 09:54.090]  And then when I went to Fort Hood and I began my first duty station, I would be so hung
[09:54.090 --> 10:00.170]  over that you would want to throw up really quickly in PT because what would happen was
[10:00.170 --> 10:02.850]  you would feel like you were dying all the way through PT.
[10:02.850 --> 10:07.690]  And then if you threw up, you would instantly feel better and it would erase the memory
[10:07.690 --> 10:08.450]  of doing PT.
[10:09.010 --> 10:13.110]  So I would really look forward to throwing up because either I could stop running or
[10:13.110 --> 10:16.670]  because it would erase the memory of having to work out feeling sick.
[10:16.970 --> 10:19.210]  And then I quit working out for years and years and years.
[10:19.630 --> 10:25.550]  But then every time since, like one time Gav, Dan Godwin, and I took a Krav Maga class,
[10:26.150 --> 10:29.050]  and like halfway through, I was like, I'll be right back.
[10:29.090 --> 10:32.150]  And I had to go outside in the front of the place and throw up, come back in,
[10:32.150 --> 10:34.630]  work out for another 10 minutes, go back out, throw up.
[10:34.970 --> 10:43.590]  I did some sort of a CrossFit class at a gym one time, and I had to leave in the middle
[10:43.590 --> 10:44.250]  of it and throw up.
[10:44.350 --> 10:45.450]  And everybody's like, are you okay?
[10:45.690 --> 10:47.810]  And I'm like, yeah, I'm just throwing up because I'm working out.
[10:48.010 --> 10:50.090]  And people are like, nobody does that.
[10:50.130 --> 10:51.770]  And I realized that nobody does that.
[10:51.890 --> 10:59.270]  But my brain is now tricked where I work out to vomit as quickly as possible, I guess,
[10:59.270 --> 11:03.610]  because like the rote memory is that like, I can stop as soon as I puke.
[11:03.730 --> 11:05.930]  So I get to puke really fast.
[11:06.310 --> 11:07.270]  And that's why I don't work out.
[11:07.530 --> 11:09.390]  You also puke as though it's nothing.
[11:09.770 --> 11:15.570]  Like at that time where you tried to put your dog tag chain down your nose hole and out your mouth.
[11:15.890 --> 11:16.270]  No.
[11:16.610 --> 11:19.930]  And you threw up everywhere and clogged the sink.
[11:20.150 --> 11:21.090]  I filled the sink with puke.
[11:21.090 --> 11:25.110]  For some reason, threw up in the sink instead of the toilet and clogged it.
[11:27.070 --> 11:31.530]  The disappointing thing there was that was so easy to do when I was like 18.
[11:32.030 --> 11:37.150]  And I was so dismayed to find out that at that point in my late 30s or whatever I was,
[11:37.470 --> 11:43.710]  that it was so goddamn physically difficult to do it that I threw up an entire sink worth.
[11:43.890 --> 11:45.270]  Yeah, I got through it though.
[11:45.290 --> 11:45.730]  I did it.
[11:45.850 --> 11:46.630]  I'll never do it again.
[11:46.710 --> 11:48.250]  But I fucking did it that one last time.
[11:48.430 --> 11:49.170]  You just disappeared off.
[11:49.350 --> 11:50.770]  You're like, yeah, I can still do this.
[11:50.790 --> 11:51.990]  And you were like, you started doing it.
[11:52.030 --> 11:53.070]  Then you're like, oh, hold on, be right back.
[11:53.070 --> 11:56.590]  And then you came back with it threaded through your sinuses.
[11:56.850 --> 11:59.490]  And then you're like, hey, check this out.
[11:59.530 --> 12:01.110]  And you took me to your sink.
[12:01.930 --> 12:03.690]  You just disappeared off on your own.
[12:04.150 --> 12:05.310]  OK, I'm looking at the shelves.
[12:05.490 --> 12:09.030]  Yeah, I want to just make a quick point before before we continue.
[12:09.850 --> 12:13.830]  Nick very kindly looked at the shelves, said that's something that I imagine something
[12:13.830 --> 12:14.550]  far less grand.
[12:14.870 --> 12:16.330]  And he said, that looks amazing.
[12:16.370 --> 12:16.730]  Well done.
[12:17.150 --> 12:18.090]  You didn't do anything.
[12:18.170 --> 12:18.890]  You paid somebody.
[12:19.190 --> 12:20.010]  You don't get a well done.
[12:20.010 --> 12:24.510]  That's like a full like armoire shelving cabinets.
[12:25.170 --> 12:26.210]  There's like a ledge.
[12:26.390 --> 12:27.970]  There's probably what?
[12:28.130 --> 12:31.870]  Twelve, fifteen shelves there, maybe on the side shelves.
[12:32.170 --> 12:36.450]  And on the and then on the other side is that it is a built in desk and more shelves.
[12:36.890 --> 12:37.650]  That's why.
[12:37.750 --> 12:39.490]  And it's all in the room I record in.
[12:39.590 --> 12:41.170]  That's why I couldn't record in the room.
[12:42.150 --> 12:45.010]  Nine dudes in there for 14 hours that day.
[12:45.130 --> 12:47.230]  I feel like you did describe it like that.
[12:47.230 --> 12:51.270]  But in my head, whenever we went back to it, I was just thinking about you putting up
[12:51.270 --> 12:57.490]  like a couple of like a hundred percent, 100 percent.
[12:57.670 --> 13:00.810]  I was explaining to you what a major ordeal this was.
[13:01.110 --> 13:04.390]  And when we got back on, you guys were like, you hung an Ikea shelf, asshole.
[13:04.590 --> 13:09.010]  What Nick posted is exactly what I was picturing.
[13:09.150 --> 13:15.050]  I was like, well, congrats on your shelves.
[13:15.150 --> 13:16.490]  They they look nice.
[13:16.490 --> 13:17.730]  We congratulate them.
[13:17.870 --> 13:18.550]  They do look nice.
[13:18.630 --> 13:19.990]  Does he need a congrats?
[13:20.530 --> 13:22.490]  I appreciate that, Andrew.
[13:22.590 --> 13:22.910]  Thank you.
[13:23.870 --> 13:25.210]  Congrats to you as well.
[13:25.910 --> 13:28.010]  Yeah, this is painted, obviously.
[13:28.350 --> 13:29.150]  And I got to go.
[13:29.310 --> 13:29.970]  It's a whole.
[13:30.210 --> 13:31.770]  Are you matching the color of the ceiling?
[13:32.010 --> 13:32.270]  Yeah.
[13:32.370 --> 13:32.570]  Yeah.
[13:32.570 --> 13:33.750]  Matching the color of the ceiling.
[13:33.750 --> 13:36.910]  And then in the other one where the desk is, there's wallpaper that's got to be installed.
[13:36.990 --> 13:37.970]  It's a whole fucking thing.
[13:38.030 --> 13:38.510]  I'm not anywhere.
[13:38.670 --> 13:39.450]  I'm not close.
[13:39.750 --> 13:40.330]  Not even close.
[13:40.470 --> 13:41.790]  You must like your house.
[13:42.130 --> 13:42.530]  I'm not.
[13:42.650 --> 13:43.150]  I'm not.
[13:43.390 --> 13:44.990]  Well, yeah, I don't hate it.
[13:44.990 --> 13:46.410]  I don't know.
[13:46.470 --> 13:48.830]  I just never lived in a house long enough where I'm like, yeah,
[13:48.870 --> 13:50.650]  I'm going to do all this custom stuff to it.
[13:50.870 --> 13:51.190]  Dude.
[13:51.330 --> 13:53.170]  But yeah, you've you've done it.
[13:53.270 --> 13:53.730]  That's awesome.
[13:53.850 --> 13:55.010]  That's that's money invested.
[13:55.390 --> 13:58.950]  I hope you get to a point in your life where you feel like installing built ins.
[13:59.550 --> 14:01.030]  And it seems like a wise investment.
[14:01.130 --> 14:01.930]  That's the dream, Geoff.
[14:01.990 --> 14:04.890]  I've been I've kind of been pitching this already.
[14:05.070 --> 14:06.810]  You don't need to go all the way to a shelf, Gavin.
[14:06.850 --> 14:07.890]  You can make small changes.
[14:08.330 --> 14:10.470]  You can customize things in a small way.
[14:10.670 --> 14:11.650]  You can make your space your own.
[14:12.030 --> 14:14.350]  Andrew, I know you have a thousand things to talk about.
[14:14.350 --> 14:15.450]  Gavin, what do you got going on?
[14:15.610 --> 14:19.070]  Well, I just feel like we should mention that we took another break.
[14:19.430 --> 14:23.890]  Andrew, 11th hour last week, cancelled the podcast recording.
[14:24.310 --> 14:25.610]  Way later than I cancelled.
[14:25.770 --> 14:27.350]  Way later than when I cancelled.
[14:27.350 --> 14:28.610]  Not from my perspective.
[14:29.250 --> 14:30.250]  Not from my perspective.
[14:30.530 --> 14:33.270]  It was like, what, two hours before we were going to do it?
[14:33.530 --> 14:34.350]  You were like, we can't.
[14:34.390 --> 14:35.010]  We can't do it.
[14:35.330 --> 14:36.170]  No, it's not true.
[14:36.550 --> 14:37.230]  That's not true.
[14:37.490 --> 14:38.170]  You're making it.
[14:38.270 --> 14:38.570]  I try.
[14:38.750 --> 14:42.190]  It's worse than that because I reached out in the morning to talk shit about Geoff
[14:42.190 --> 14:43.670]  and that I wasn't going to cancel.
[14:43.670 --> 14:45.710]  That is a hero for not cancelling.
[14:45.930 --> 14:47.150]  Let me look at the timestamp.
[14:47.330 --> 14:50.210]  It was, I want to say, 7.30-ish AM.
[14:50.350 --> 14:51.710]  It was around 7 AM, I'd guess.
[14:51.930 --> 14:52.950]  You're talking earlier in the morning.
[14:53.030 --> 14:54.630]  I must record from my phone again.
[14:55.390 --> 14:57.450]  Tried my best, but I can't record today.
[14:57.710 --> 14:58.250]  Can't do it.
[14:58.490 --> 15:00.950]  That was at 1.30 for a three-minute recording.
[15:00.950 --> 15:01.930]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:01.990 --> 15:02.670]  It was before that.
[15:02.750 --> 15:03.550]  Keep scrolling up.
[15:03.790 --> 15:06.290]  Yeah, you said you might have to record from your phone.
[15:06.430 --> 15:10.290]  You didn't cancel it and end the whole day until 1.30.
[15:10.770 --> 15:12.710]  Yeah, but I also said I'd be willing to record on my phone.
[15:12.710 --> 15:14.270]  90 minutes, dude, 90 minutes.
[15:14.430 --> 15:15.390]  At the end, at the end.
[15:15.670 --> 15:20.690]  And might I point out that I couldn't tell if it was fucking real or a bit.
[15:21.070 --> 15:24.550]  So I showed up to record anyway, just in case.
[15:25.570 --> 15:27.670]  So it's still wasted my time.
[15:27.950 --> 15:29.430]  I was there at three o'clock.
[15:29.530 --> 15:35.470]  I stuck around till 3.15 just to make sure by myself in the fucking Discord.
[15:35.770 --> 15:37.650]  But the way, the things you were saying,
[15:38.270 --> 15:41.730]  you were basically calling yourself a hero for even attempting it.
[15:41.770 --> 15:44.370]  It was an act of heroism.
[15:44.850 --> 15:48.670]  Then you said you wouldn't be able to record from your desk.
[15:48.850 --> 15:51.650]  You said you wouldn't be able to record comfort, comfortably.
[15:52.290 --> 15:52.530]  Nope.
[15:52.770 --> 15:55.770]  You said you could do about 25 minutes in this condition.
[15:56.230 --> 15:57.790]  But an hour would be tough.
[15:58.190 --> 15:58.990]  What on earth?
[15:59.390 --> 16:00.490]  Because you wouldn't tell us anything.
[16:01.010 --> 16:02.470]  What on earth are you talking about?
[16:02.490 --> 16:04.170]  Do you want to get into it, Andrew?
[16:04.350 --> 16:04.910]  Do we want to?
[16:05.370 --> 16:06.270]  OK, we can.
[16:06.290 --> 16:09.910]  I've wanted to know badly for a full fucking week.
[16:09.910 --> 16:11.410]  And I've just been sitting here waiting,
[16:11.810 --> 16:14.910]  sitting on my hands, trying not to talk to you because I don't want to spoil it.
[16:14.930 --> 16:17.850]  In my head, you Michael Scotted your foot.
[16:18.370 --> 16:21.570]  You stepped on your waffle maker like he stepped on his George Foreman.
[16:21.690 --> 16:23.150]  That's what I've been picturing all week.
[16:23.770 --> 16:24.130]  Absolutely.
[16:24.590 --> 16:26.510]  I definitely Icarus myself.
[16:27.290 --> 16:33.510]  I embraced a new lifestyle and I flew a little too close to the sun and it escalated poorly.
[16:33.830 --> 16:37.550]  So last time we spoke, I had ordered the 70 pounds of mix.
[16:38.090 --> 16:39.110]  Yeah, I was waiting for it.
[16:39.110 --> 16:42.290]  On the previous early on Saturday, I rolled.
[16:42.650 --> 16:43.430]  I have shitty ankles.
[16:43.590 --> 16:44.870]  I've always had awful ankles.
[16:45.330 --> 16:46.450]  Just the worst.
[16:46.570 --> 16:49.290]  Even when I was a kid, like I'd run with a limp when I wasn't hurt.
[16:49.390 --> 16:50.230]  Just bad ankles.
[16:50.710 --> 16:51.670]  And I rolled.
[16:52.330 --> 16:56.790]  I rolled my right ankle on a walk because the curb wasn't level and I didn't notice.
[16:56.910 --> 16:58.150]  So I rolled my right ankle.
[16:59.270 --> 17:02.230]  Then later in the day, the 70 pounds of mix came,
[17:02.430 --> 17:05.030]  which the boxes were not built to carry that much weight.
[17:05.130 --> 17:08.390]  They put them in like three different Amazon boxes and they were falling apart
[17:08.390 --> 17:09.630]  as it's carrying them.
[17:10.130 --> 17:15.130]  So I'm on one leg and I'm trying to carry 70 pounds of mix of several sets of stairs.
[17:15.490 --> 17:16.630]  And I keep falling.
[17:17.170 --> 17:20.230]  Yeah, I did initially try to carry everything up the one go and I fell.
[17:20.390 --> 17:21.090]  And that was a mistake.
[17:21.370 --> 17:25.350]  With a rolled ankle, you took all 70 pounds in your hand.
[17:25.390 --> 17:26.150]  I tried.
[17:27.050 --> 17:27.890]  I tried.
[17:27.970 --> 17:28.410]  I almost fell.
[17:28.630 --> 17:32.550]  I almost did the Home Alone fall where I was like slowly falling backwards off the stairs.
[17:32.550 --> 17:33.650]  It was like, oh, I can just grab.
[17:33.770 --> 17:34.470]  Oh no, I can't.
[17:34.490 --> 17:35.050]  I can't grab.
[17:35.410 --> 17:36.670]  And I barely caught myself.
[17:36.670 --> 17:39.070]  But so then I hurt.
[17:39.690 --> 17:43.110]  I hurt my ankle, my other ankle doing that.
[17:43.230 --> 17:45.350]  I hurt my left, my right ankle.
[17:45.410 --> 17:47.410]  I rolled walking my left ankle.
[17:47.530 --> 17:53.250]  I hurt trying to get the mix up and it was bad, but it wasn't the worst injury I've had.
[17:53.290 --> 17:54.210]  I've had this before.
[17:54.250 --> 17:58.110]  I've had issues with my ankles before where it typically is like I'm out for a week.
[17:59.450 --> 18:02.170]  But I really I've embraced this waffle lifestyle.
[18:02.410 --> 18:06.650]  I've had so much fun and I thought I need to add more because I have a fridge.
[18:06.670 --> 18:08.210]  So I have a fridge.
[18:08.310 --> 18:09.170]  I have everything I need.
[18:09.290 --> 18:12.150]  I don't need to necessarily stop at waffles.
[18:12.490 --> 18:16.490]  So I made a new investment to add to my lifestyle.
[18:16.710 --> 18:17.770]  I bought this.
[18:18.170 --> 18:19.730]  I thought this could be perfect.
[18:19.850 --> 18:20.590]  I could have breakfast.
[18:20.710 --> 18:21.610]  I could have lunch.
[18:23.170 --> 18:24.330]  Later in the day.
[18:24.570 --> 18:30.130]  You posted a toaster that toasts hot dog buns and hot dogs.
[18:30.350 --> 18:32.490]  Yes, I bought a dog toaster.
[18:32.610 --> 18:34.030]  I thought I'll sit at my desk.
[18:34.090 --> 18:35.810]  I could cook some dogs up for lunch.
[18:35.810 --> 18:36.970]  I have a hurt ankle.
[18:37.170 --> 18:38.070]  This is perfect.
[18:38.570 --> 18:39.990]  I'm so glad I invested in this.
[18:40.250 --> 18:41.570]  This is it arrived on Tuesday.
[18:41.770 --> 18:44.170]  It arrived middle of the week.
[18:46.190 --> 18:49.830]  I had this whole dog fantasy lined up, Gavin, that you have no idea.
[18:49.950 --> 18:51.870]  I was so excited to add to the waffles.
[18:52.350 --> 18:54.650]  You've got the shortest attention span ever.
[18:54.730 --> 18:56.850]  You've already ignored the 70 pounds of pancakes.
[18:56.970 --> 18:58.190]  You're on to dog toasting.
[18:58.230 --> 18:59.290]  Is this also in your bedroom?
[18:59.590 --> 19:00.350]  Yes. Oh, yes.
[19:00.410 --> 19:03.210]  Putting it on my desk was the whole game plan I had.
[19:03.270 --> 19:04.370]  I had my dogs on my desk.
[19:04.370 --> 19:07.230]  I was going to make desk dogs and I was just going to love life.
[19:07.330 --> 19:10.890]  I could make waffles in bed, dogs at my desk, fully covered.
[19:11.290 --> 19:12.310]  This is a great thing.
[19:12.650 --> 19:13.650]  So I get the maker.
[19:13.870 --> 19:14.830]  My ankle is sore.
[19:15.070 --> 19:15.810]  It's not that bad.
[19:15.810 --> 19:16.950]  I'm recovering on Tuesday.
[19:17.270 --> 19:19.570]  I get the hot dog maker on Tuesday.
[19:20.270 --> 19:21.150]  I'm hurting.
[19:21.390 --> 19:25.650]  I don't have any food in my room, but I do have a packet of hot dogs and some buns.
[19:26.070 --> 19:26.690]  In the fridge.
[19:26.930 --> 19:27.590]  In my fridge.
[19:27.830 --> 19:31.790]  And I thought I'm going to cook a desk dog up on the podcast.
[19:31.790 --> 19:34.690]  That will be my introduction to this thing.
[19:34.870 --> 19:39.250]  That'd be really funny if I just throw some desk dogs on, eat a dog while we record.
[19:39.790 --> 19:41.630]  But I was hungry and I thought, oh, fuck it.
[19:41.650 --> 19:42.590]  I'll test it anyway.
[19:42.730 --> 19:49.070]  So I read the instructions and the instructions say experience or get ready to to have a strong
[19:49.070 --> 19:51.310]  chemical odor on your first cook.
[19:51.490 --> 19:52.490]  So it's prepared for that.
[19:52.530 --> 19:53.290]  I wasn't worried about it.
[19:53.310 --> 19:53.870]  It's basic.
[19:54.110 --> 19:56.550]  It's literally just a toaster you put hot dogs into.
[19:56.790 --> 19:58.190]  So I put the dogs in.
[19:58.730 --> 20:00.890]  I'm afraid I don't want to undercook the dogs.
[20:00.890 --> 20:04.310]  I don't know how effective the heating mechanism is on the inside of this thing.
[20:04.530 --> 20:05.710]  Well, I assume they're cooked already.
[20:05.890 --> 20:06.690]  You're just heating them up.
[20:06.830 --> 20:07.630]  Yeah, I'm heating them.
[20:07.750 --> 20:08.330]  It's fair.
[20:08.590 --> 20:09.550]  Yeah, I'm just heating them.
[20:09.550 --> 20:10.910]  I wanted a good heat, though.
[20:11.010 --> 20:17.250]  So I cranked it all the way to the highest setting and I'm sitting at my desk tracking
[20:17.250 --> 20:19.190]  the election, got my desk dogs going.
[20:19.510 --> 20:23.690]  It's a good night and I can really smell this strong chemical odor.
[20:23.850 --> 20:26.130]  And it's really, it's strong, but I expect it.
[20:26.170 --> 20:26.690]  So it's fine.
[20:27.170 --> 20:28.310]  And I'm just relaxed.
[20:28.410 --> 20:29.190]  I'm really happy.
[20:29.270 --> 20:30.150]  I'm enjoying life.
[20:30.150 --> 20:37.070]  And then my room starts vibrating because I have triggered the loud, the loudest,
[20:37.650 --> 20:40.270]  the loudest smoke alarm I've ever heard.
[20:40.350 --> 20:44.910]  I set off the smoke alarm in my bedroom, cooking my desk dogs, and it was ringing.
[20:45.410 --> 20:46.450]  Everything was shaking.
[20:46.750 --> 20:47.630]  It was so bad.
[20:47.810 --> 20:49.310]  I go into full panic mode.
[20:49.650 --> 20:51.370]  I ripped the machine off my desk.
[20:51.510 --> 20:56.410]  Dogs go flying and I hobble into my bathroom because there's no smoke machine in my bathroom.
[20:56.590 --> 20:57.930]  Not smoke machine, smoke alarm.
[20:58.110 --> 20:59.690]  I don't have a smoke machine in there either.
[20:59.690 --> 21:01.550]  But I'm worried about the smoke alarm.
[21:02.010 --> 21:03.010]  No fears about a machine.
[21:03.390 --> 21:08.650]  So I put the desk dog device in underneath where my towels are in my bathroom.
[21:09.070 --> 21:10.090]  I'm good there.
[21:10.890 --> 21:12.110]  Initial problem solved.
[21:12.290 --> 21:12.950]  Dogs are somewhere.
[21:13.070 --> 21:14.190]  I don't know where they flew to.
[21:14.370 --> 21:15.090]  Not a worry.
[21:15.430 --> 21:21.630]  My next concern is that I have triggered the fire system for my entire building is my worry.
[21:21.810 --> 21:25.370]  So then I have to stumble out into my hallway, make sure there are no other alarms.
[21:25.550 --> 21:27.350]  Thankfully, I only activated mine.
[21:27.990 --> 21:31.790]  Um, but recently they tested all the smoke alarms.
[21:31.970 --> 21:36.170]  And whenever they'd set one off, a guy was on a phone talking to someone off site.
[21:36.390 --> 21:37.950]  And they're like, yeah, no, it went off.
[21:38.010 --> 21:38.290]  We're good.
[21:38.330 --> 21:39.210]  We can go to the next one.
[21:39.470 --> 21:44.810]  So I thought, oh, shit, this is going to send a signal to somebody potentially.
[21:45.030 --> 21:46.690]  And the fire cavalry might be coming.
[21:47.090 --> 21:48.530]  I don't know if they're going to send somebody.
[21:48.710 --> 21:54.490]  And I don't know how I can explain the desk dogs was the cause of this fire investigation.
[21:55.430 --> 21:58.850]  So I'm nervous about them embracing my new lifestyle.
[21:59.710 --> 22:04.450]  So I sit for a second and then I think I need to do something about all of my pancake mix.
[22:04.570 --> 22:06.490]  So like they were bags of cocaine.
[22:06.790 --> 22:10.930]  I grabbed them one at a time and start frantically hiding them throughout my room
[22:10.930 --> 22:16.670]  because I just don't want them to stumble into 70 pounds of pancake mix and the waffle machine.
[22:16.770 --> 22:17.790]  What's wrong with you?
[22:17.850 --> 22:19.190]  They could take the wrong idea.
[22:19.390 --> 22:19.870]  They would.
[22:20.230 --> 22:20.850]  I don't know.
[22:20.890 --> 22:21.750]  I thought I could get in trouble.
[22:21.830 --> 22:23.230]  I don't think this is probably a normal thing.
[22:23.230 --> 22:27.110]  I don't imagine the building manager would love this new lifestyle I've embraced.
[22:27.270 --> 22:30.870]  So I'm hiding everything and I get it all done.
[22:30.950 --> 22:33.710]  And then the dog adrenaline has worn off at this point.
[22:33.810 --> 22:39.130]  And my ankle is very sore because I've been running around moving 10 pound bags of pancake mix,
[22:39.410 --> 22:42.750]  running up and down stairs, making sure alarms weren't going off.
[22:42.950 --> 22:43.750]  It was the whole thing.
[22:44.430 --> 22:50.810]  And so the pancake mix initially fractured, fractured me, put a dent in the armor.
[22:50.810 --> 22:53.170]  And the desk dogs broke.
[22:54.270 --> 22:59.610]  That's how my ankle fell apart, was the moving of the desk dogs on Tuesday.
[22:59.850 --> 23:02.930]  Could not walk, could not stand the next day.
[23:03.290 --> 23:04.310]  Just couldn't do anything.
[23:04.670 --> 23:07.930]  Had to spend the next several days just laying in bed.
[23:08.030 --> 23:13.390]  I don't understand why you couldn't do it from your desk, but you could still do it from your phone.
[23:13.710 --> 23:14.690]  I... yeah.
[23:14.910 --> 23:19.170]  I drove from multiple root canals straight to the podcast.
[23:19.170 --> 23:22.110]  And you had a sore... you had an ankle.
[23:22.370 --> 23:22.610]  Owie.
[23:22.910 --> 23:26.030]  No, my ankle was so bad I couldn't sit at my desk.
[23:26.190 --> 23:27.710]  I couldn't. I had to have it elevated.
[23:28.210 --> 23:29.070]  I couldn't have it down.
[23:29.430 --> 23:32.910]  The day we tried to record that morning, when I said, like, give me an hour,
[23:33.130 --> 23:38.170]  I took five Advils at once and then was just going to see if it would numb my foot.
[23:38.230 --> 23:39.770]  And it didn't. It didn't make any difference.
[23:39.910 --> 23:40.690]  That's what I have to call it.
[23:40.690 --> 23:41.870]  You shouldn't do that.
[23:42.210 --> 23:43.190]  I made a real effort.
[23:43.290 --> 23:43.650]  Yeah, that's probably a lot.
[23:43.830 --> 23:45.170]  Your liver's going to fail.
[23:45.390 --> 23:48.790]  It was a terrible idea, but I tried it because I'm a hero.
[23:48.790 --> 23:50.670]  And I want to be here for you guys.
[23:50.750 --> 23:53.010]  I'm like Geoff, worried about some shelves.
[23:53.230 --> 23:54.370]  I make every attempt.
[23:54.690 --> 23:56.970]  And so I could have... I tried.
[23:57.150 --> 24:02.830]  I'd sit at my desk and I'd go like every ten seconds because my ankle would throb.
[24:02.930 --> 24:06.090]  It was a throbbing, stabbing pain that was horrendous.
[24:06.630 --> 24:07.670]  You know what you should have done?
[24:07.770 --> 24:09.690]  You should have made a tourniquet with hot dogs.
[24:10.050 --> 24:11.370]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[24:11.730 --> 24:12.490]  Split it up.
[24:12.670 --> 24:17.070]  I'm worried now that we... that Geoff and I live so far from you.
[24:17.070 --> 24:19.750]  Like something... you're going to kill yourself by accident.
[24:20.370 --> 24:25.430]  Look, look, you almost burnt down your entire building with desk dogs.
[24:25.670 --> 24:27.370]  And then you took five Advils.
[24:27.870 --> 24:29.030]  That was one day.
[24:29.130 --> 24:30.770]  And then it took you a week to recover.
[24:31.070 --> 24:32.730]  Well, I'm still recovering.
[24:32.950 --> 24:34.470]  I don't have pain, but I can't really walk.
[24:35.090 --> 24:36.490]  But everything was fine.
[24:36.610 --> 24:38.490]  I don't take that many that often.
[24:38.630 --> 24:40.610]  It was like, I need... we're trying to record today.
[24:41.010 --> 24:42.230]  This is what did happen though.
[24:42.770 --> 24:44.710]  I, for the very first time, dangerous.
[24:44.710 --> 24:47.210]  Don't recommend it unless you absolutely need it.
[24:47.330 --> 24:50.230]  Took a pain reliever that was beyond what you could get.
[24:50.450 --> 24:51.390]  Just like at a counter.
[24:51.910 --> 24:53.330]  Like a prescription...
[24:53.330 --> 24:54.650]  You got prescription painkillers.
[24:55.010 --> 24:56.490]  Prescription painkillers.
[24:56.670 --> 24:57.670]  Real game changer.
[24:57.990 --> 24:58.510]  Big help.
[24:58.850 --> 25:00.070]  That's why you were texting me.
[25:00.610 --> 25:01.890]  I feel like I'm cheating.
[25:02.510 --> 25:05.370]  This is what... yes, this is literally...
[25:05.370 --> 25:08.330]  I had a really bad night before I took the first one.
[25:08.510 --> 25:09.030]  It was rough.
[25:09.570 --> 25:10.410]  And I'm laying in bed.
[25:10.430 --> 25:11.710]  I'm like, I need to do something.
[25:12.070 --> 25:14.370]  So I ordered a walking boot off of Amazon.
[25:14.370 --> 25:15.730]  I could make this.
[25:15.810 --> 25:16.610]  It's going to arrive in two days.
[25:16.690 --> 25:17.130]  I can last.
[25:17.210 --> 25:17.670]  It'll be fine.
[25:18.510 --> 25:20.410]  I then got the prescription painkillers.
[25:20.470 --> 25:21.150]  And I took two.
[25:21.390 --> 25:23.670]  I canceled my boot order 40 minutes later.
[25:23.810 --> 25:24.590]  I'm like, I'm good.
[25:24.810 --> 25:26.210]  Don't need the boot anymore.
[25:26.730 --> 25:28.830]  Don't you guys have socialized health care?
[25:28.910 --> 25:30.350]  Can't you just go to the doctor and get a boot?
[25:30.610 --> 25:32.030]  I couldn't leave.
[25:32.610 --> 25:33.490]  I couldn't move.
[25:33.710 --> 25:34.910]  What's he going to limp to his boot?
[25:36.510 --> 25:39.850]  Eric suggested I throw myself off the series of balconies,
[25:39.870 --> 25:41.310]  which I could have technically done.
[25:41.710 --> 25:42.930]  But like, there's no way...
[25:42.930 --> 25:43.710]  I was stuck in my room.
[25:44.190 --> 25:46.470]  Today's the first day I left my room in like 10 days.
[25:47.310 --> 25:49.010]  Well, let me ask you two questions.
[25:51.310 --> 25:53.250]  First, did you say fire cavalry?
[25:53.650 --> 25:53.930]  Yeah.
[25:54.090 --> 25:55.330]  I didn't know who was going to come.
[25:55.450 --> 25:56.010]  Fire department.
[25:56.210 --> 25:57.430]  Maybe the people who work here.
[25:57.510 --> 25:58.010]  A whole group.
[25:58.150 --> 25:58.950]  I didn't know how many.
[25:58.990 --> 25:59.250]  Okay.
[25:59.370 --> 26:00.610]  I didn't know if that's like...
[26:00.610 --> 26:02.010]  That's what they call the fire department.
[26:02.130 --> 26:03.330]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:03.410 --> 26:03.650]  All right.
[26:03.670 --> 26:04.850]  And I was going to ask like, what the...
[26:04.850 --> 26:06.530]  Now I got to know, what do they call it in England?
[26:07.010 --> 26:07.430]  The brigade.
[26:07.970 --> 26:09.130]  The fire brigade, right?
[26:09.170 --> 26:10.250]  Brigade is a good word too.
[26:10.390 --> 26:11.090]  Well, they used to.
[26:11.330 --> 26:12.370]  I'm not sure if they still do.
[26:12.630 --> 26:13.350]  Second question.
[26:13.710 --> 26:16.750]  Have you had a successful hot dog since?
[26:16.910 --> 26:17.570]  And how are they?
[26:17.830 --> 26:19.290]  That's a great question, Geoff.
[26:19.830 --> 26:23.570]  Amongst the pain of Tuesday night, my ankle throbbing, still sore.
[26:23.750 --> 26:24.630]  Never ate dinner.
[26:24.970 --> 26:27.910]  But I was scared to set the alarm off again.
[26:28.250 --> 26:31.950]  So I sneakily, I sneakily cooked some dogs in my closet.
[26:32.470 --> 26:35.730]  For a little sneaky desk dog closet action.
[26:37.050 --> 26:38.230]  I had two of them.
[26:38.450 --> 26:39.210]  And they were fine.
[26:39.670 --> 26:42.010]  It had enclosed unventilated space.
[26:42.010 --> 26:44.370]  Where probably a bunch of fabric is.
[26:44.890 --> 26:45.830]  Uh, yeah, there's a bunch of fabric.
[26:46.010 --> 26:47.390]  I don't, you know, it was late.
[26:47.470 --> 26:50.110]  I kept the lights off so I couldn't see if there was.
[26:50.290 --> 26:50.810]  I was just very nervous.
[26:50.810 --> 26:52.030]  You can't see it, it doesn't exist.
[26:52.630 --> 26:53.350]  It's far.
[26:53.430 --> 26:55.410]  It was on the opposite corner of the alarm.
[26:55.550 --> 26:56.510]  I had a fan going.
[26:56.650 --> 26:57.910]  I'm sure everything was fine.
[26:57.950 --> 27:01.590]  To be fair, if the lights are off, you're going to notice the fire sooner.
[27:04.530 --> 27:05.410]  There's no fire.
[27:05.470 --> 27:09.290]  I'm 32, juggling family, working full time and earning a bachelor's degree.
[27:09.290 --> 27:13.670]  At University of Phoenix, I earn career-relevant skills with every five-week course.
[27:13.810 --> 27:16.230]  Skills I can use now, not just after graduation.
[27:16.650 --> 27:18.550]  Earn skills weeks, not years.
[27:18.890 --> 27:20.030]  Visit phoenix.edu.
[27:20.570 --> 27:22.850]  You don't technically need this car.
[27:23.170 --> 27:25.010]  You say that out loud to yourself.
[27:25.450 --> 27:27.010]  You say, I have no space.
[27:27.310 --> 27:29.210]  You say, eh, I'm just looking.
[27:29.610 --> 27:30.710]  Then you click.
[27:31.210 --> 27:34.450]  Then you zoom in on photo number 87 and whisper, oh no.
[27:34.950 --> 27:37.450]  Then you text a friend, the one who always enables you.
[27:37.450 --> 27:42.550]  You say to yourself, this is the last one, knowing it is not.
[27:43.030 --> 27:44.170]  You don't need this car.
[27:44.590 --> 27:48.130]  But maybe, just maybe, this car needs you.
[27:48.510 --> 27:48.990]  Bring a trailer.
[27:49.330 --> 27:50.530]  It's never just a car.
[27:51.010 --> 27:53.110]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico.
[27:53.590 --> 27:55.630]  Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[27:56.070 --> 28:01.070]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells.
[28:01.150 --> 28:03.110]  But they found something unexpected instead.
[28:03.410 --> 28:05.890]  It was still crisp, lively, and smooth.
[28:05.890 --> 28:07.910]  But it had nothing to do with waves.
[28:08.210 --> 28:10.770]  It was Pacifico, a delicious Mexican lager.
[28:11.230 --> 28:13.270]  It's like it was brewed to be discovered.
[28:13.930 --> 28:15.650]  Pacifico, find your own way.

[28:25.440 --> 28:30.580]  Let's take a break from this dumb podcast for a second to talk about the social dilemma on Netflix.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.980]  It's a documentary where tech insiders explain how social media is engineered
[28:34.980 --> 28:37.440]  to exploit users' data for profit.
[28:37.440 --> 28:39.920]  They call it surveillance capitalism.
[28:40.300 --> 28:42.540]  And look, I'm cool with normal capitalism, obviously.
[28:43.060 --> 28:45.540]  I've made a living off of selling dumb slogans on t-shirts.
[28:46.100 --> 28:50.460]  And while I'm a willing participant of transactions, like every time I go to the store to buy food,
[28:50.760 --> 28:54.500]  or when I go buy cases and cases of Diet Pepsi,
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.980]  but when my data is being harvested so tech billionaires can get even richer,
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.540]  that's where I draw the line.
[29:00.940 --> 29:04.780]  And that is why I put a layer of protection around my data with ExpressVPN.
[29:04.780 --> 29:08.020]  Every time you use the internet, big tech companies mine your data
[29:08.020 --> 29:11.100]  by tracking your searches, your messages, your video history.
[29:11.440 --> 29:14.620]  They find out about all the stuff you don't necessarily want them to know about.
[29:14.920 --> 29:16.080]  You know what I'm talking about.
[29:16.380 --> 29:17.260]  Spoons and thimbles.
[29:17.720 --> 29:19.220]  Spoons and thimbles.
[29:19.680 --> 29:23.000]  But when you run ExpressVPN on your device, it hides your IP address,
[29:23.420 --> 29:25.700]  which websites can use to personally identify you.
[29:25.920 --> 29:29.300]  That makes your activity more difficult to trace and sell to advertisers.
[29:29.660 --> 29:32.220]  You still need to be careful with what you share on social media.
[29:32.220 --> 29:35.640]  But with ExpressVPN, you can make web browsing more anonymous.
[29:36.220 --> 29:40.780]  It also encrypts 100% of your internet data to keep you safe from hackers and prying eyes.
[29:41.060 --> 29:43.220]  You know, the collectible spoon cabal.
[29:43.400 --> 29:44.840]  We've talked about it in the past.
[29:45.040 --> 29:48.940]  So hey, if you don't like the idea of tech companies or anybody for that matter,
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.660]  exploiting your personal information,
[29:51.120 --> 29:55.080]  then please visit expressvpn.com slash face right now
[29:55.080 --> 29:58.100]  and you can get three extra months of ExpressVPN for free.
[29:58.480 --> 30:02.060]  That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N
[30:02.220 --> 30:05.920]  dot com slash face to protect your data.
[30:06.160 --> 30:08.240]  By the way, did you see how well I spelled that?
[30:08.500 --> 30:10.060]  First try. Nailed it.
[30:10.300 --> 30:13.880]  Go to expressvpn.com slash face to learn more.
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.820]  Support for Face comes from Manscaped, who's the best in men's below the belt grooming.
[30:20.360 --> 30:24.580]  Manscaped offers precision engineered tools to help your family jewels.
[30:24.840 --> 30:27.560]  Hey, fellas, listen up. It's getting close to Christmas.
[30:27.900 --> 30:30.620]  It's time to pin those jingle balls to the walls.
[30:30.620 --> 30:33.440]  Untrimmed pubes can be a thing of the past.
[30:33.780 --> 30:37.380]  It's time to gear up and get yourself the gift of shaving this holiday season.
[30:38.500 --> 30:38.980]  Smooth.
[30:39.800 --> 30:42.720]  I'm talking about Manscaped, the perfect package 3.0.
[30:42.960 --> 30:46.600]  I don't know if you have ever cut your balls while shaving.
[30:46.840 --> 30:49.480]  I've done it with an electric razor. I've done it with a straight razor.
[30:50.080 --> 30:51.840]  I'd like to do neither again.
[30:51.920 --> 30:54.600]  And I would, even though I don't personally know you,
[30:54.860 --> 30:58.440]  I would like for you to have the same comfort in your lives.
[30:58.440 --> 31:03.000]  I don't want to see you nicking your balls, or your shaft,
[31:03.540 --> 31:07.720]  or any of your important regions that you might want to shave.
[31:07.920 --> 31:12.280]  That's why I'm recommending you take a look at the revolutionary company Manscaped,
[31:12.560 --> 31:14.360]  because they've redesigned the electric trimmer.
[31:14.660 --> 31:19.040]  Their Lawn Mower 3.0 has proprietary advanced skin safe technology.
[31:19.340 --> 31:21.420]  The skin is the part we're trying to keep safe.
[31:21.740 --> 31:24.180]  So it's like context clues. They put it in the title.
[31:24.360 --> 31:26.720]  Keep your skin safe with this trimmer.
[31:26.720 --> 31:31.020]  You don't want to put a cut on your nut, or anywhere that's important to you for that matter.
[31:31.400 --> 31:33.540]  It's also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower,
[31:33.920 --> 31:36.660]  or drop it in the shower, and pick it back up and continue to use it.
[31:36.920 --> 31:40.760]  The Lawn Mower 3.0 comes inside the brand new Perfect Package 3.0.
[31:40.980 --> 31:43.280]  I think I said that earlier, the Perfect Package 3.0,
[31:43.400 --> 31:45.160]  but I didn't tell you what it was, so here we go.
[31:45.240 --> 31:47.180]  It makes it a perfect holiday gift this season.
[31:47.280 --> 31:52.600]  It's literally everything you need to keep trimmed, cut free, and smelling nice down there.
[31:52.720 --> 31:55.480]  Because I'll be honest, I'm the kind of guy who takes two showers a day.
[31:55.480 --> 31:56.780]  We've talked about that.
[31:57.100 --> 32:01.540]  And even after two showers, sometimes if I go for a bike ride, or for a long walk,
[32:01.560 --> 32:03.780]  I'm not running, that's for sure. I would never do that.
[32:03.980 --> 32:05.540]  But you know, maybe I cut the grass.
[32:05.940 --> 32:08.040]  You know, two showers a day might not be enough.
[32:08.280 --> 32:10.460]  That's why you might want to do a little something extra.
[32:10.860 --> 32:12.880]  Like get the Perfect Package 3.0.
[32:13.100 --> 32:17.060]  And for God's sake, don't use the same trimmer on your face as you're using on your balls.
[32:17.420 --> 32:22.220]  Two entirely different regions, entirely different sensitivity levels.
[32:22.980 --> 32:24.420]  Plus, it's just nasty.
[32:24.420 --> 32:26.580]  It's like rubbing your sweaty balls on your face.
[32:26.840 --> 32:27.860]  Which maybe that's your thing.
[32:28.040 --> 32:28.880]  I'm not judging.
[32:29.120 --> 32:32.040]  I'm just saying, uh, you're getting ready for a job interview.
[32:32.340 --> 32:34.680]  You probably don't want a face smelling like sweaty balls.
[32:35.060 --> 32:39.000]  Get 20% off and free shipping at manscaped.com slash face.
[32:39.100 --> 32:44.080]  That's 20% off with free shipping at manscaped.com slash face.
[32:44.460 --> 32:46.900]  Clean up your nuts and make Santa proud this year.
[32:49.340 --> 32:51.080]  How... I'm worried about your ankle.
[32:51.140 --> 32:52.400]  You say you always roll your ankle.
[32:52.400 --> 32:56.260]  You've been to Austin to see us several times.
[32:56.400 --> 32:56.820]  Yeah.
[32:56.920 --> 32:58.440]  And you've done fine.
[32:58.780 --> 32:59.520]  Walking around.
[32:59.820 --> 33:02.140]  No, no, no, no, I haven't.
[33:02.220 --> 33:03.460]  In fact, has not.
[33:03.800 --> 33:05.240]  Oh, did you roll an ankle at Austin?
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.540]  Yeah, oh yeah, I've rolled several ankles.
[33:07.900 --> 33:12.520]  I feel like the last time you were in Austin, I don't even know if I saw you.
[33:12.840 --> 33:15.260]  You spent like 48 hours in a bathtub or something.
[33:15.700 --> 33:16.680]  I don't remember that.
[33:17.700 --> 33:19.780]  But I will say there was one time...
[33:19.780 --> 33:21.920]  One time I went to...
[33:21.920 --> 33:23.400]  It wasn't the last time I went.
[33:23.460 --> 33:25.480]  It was one of the first times I went to Austin.
[33:25.820 --> 33:28.000]  I went to your house, Geoff, said goodbye.
[33:28.280 --> 33:28.600]  It was great.
[33:28.620 --> 33:29.520]  It was at night.
[33:29.960 --> 33:30.680]  Great night.
[33:31.160 --> 33:33.620]  Gave you a hug, gave Millie a hug, said goodbye.
[33:33.720 --> 33:34.480]  Everything was great.
[33:34.740 --> 33:37.320]  I wasn't familiar with your street and the curb.
[33:37.660 --> 33:40.840]  And your curb was like four feet off the ground.
[33:41.300 --> 33:42.800]  I immediately rolled it.
[33:43.680 --> 33:44.100]  Badly.
[33:44.300 --> 33:45.300]  It was a bad roll.
[33:45.620 --> 33:49.040]  And so then I get in the Uber and I'm leaving the next day and I can't walk.
[33:49.780 --> 33:54.020]  And I nearly fainted in the airport because I hadn't eaten anything.
[33:54.160 --> 33:56.060]  And I started losing my vision.
[33:56.340 --> 34:00.220]  And my bag was like 20 pounds because I only pack one bag when I travel.
[34:00.360 --> 34:02.260]  And it's like genuinely 20 pounds.
[34:02.400 --> 34:03.440]  And I'm stumbling.
[34:03.760 --> 34:05.000]  I'm just dragging my foot.
[34:05.080 --> 34:09.880]  And I bought three slices of pizza and a Gatorade while my vision was going out.
[34:10.060 --> 34:10.880]  Like, I couldn't see.
[34:10.980 --> 34:13.040]  I was on my way to blackout, just hobbling.
[34:13.420 --> 34:14.420]  And I'm all good.
[34:14.480 --> 34:15.300]  Like, I got the pizza.
[34:15.460 --> 34:15.980]  I had the Gatorade.
[34:16.020 --> 34:16.820]  Everything is fine.
[34:16.820 --> 34:20.840]  But yeah, say I've never had an ankle injury in Austin is a lot.
[34:21.060 --> 34:24.600]  Didn't you get so sick you couldn't leave your bed or the bathtub or something?
[34:24.720 --> 34:27.420]  You were like, you landed in Austin deathly ill.
[34:27.540 --> 34:28.300]  I remember this.
[34:28.420 --> 34:28.800]  I know.
[34:28.980 --> 34:29.900]  I half the time.
[34:30.300 --> 34:30.980]  Well, the day.
[34:31.760 --> 34:32.240]  Okay.
[34:32.980 --> 34:34.060]  I'm gonna throw up.
[34:35.240 --> 34:36.480]  Twice in two days.
[34:37.560 --> 34:39.840]  Gavin, you're blowing through your quota.
[34:40.000 --> 34:40.620]  Slow down.
[34:40.760 --> 34:41.840]  That's my yearly allowance.
[34:42.080 --> 34:43.000]  Oh, I'm crying.
[34:43.020 --> 34:44.680]  I've had no pukes left for 12 months.
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.140]  I'm freaking just tearing up.
[34:47.660 --> 34:53.420]  So the time I vomited Big Red was it was after I get sick.
[34:53.520 --> 34:55.300]  70% of the time I go to Austin.
[34:55.620 --> 34:56.580]  I just have terrible luck.
[34:56.920 --> 34:57.780]  It must be the water.
[34:58.540 --> 35:00.080]  Yeah, it's clearly the water.
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.240]  I always get a cold.
[35:02.480 --> 35:03.140]  I got everybody.
[35:03.260 --> 35:03.800]  It was bad.
[35:03.840 --> 35:04.500]  I always get sick.
[35:04.580 --> 35:05.260]  It's never good.
[35:05.580 --> 35:10.080]  But the day I vomited Big Red, I was super sick and I didn't know it yet.
[35:10.220 --> 35:14.000]  And I was staying with people and we made an agreement that I would pay
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.780]  for the Uber to the convention center.
[35:17.160 --> 35:18.260]  They would pay for it back.
[35:18.540 --> 35:22.360]  They had never used one of these apps before, and they could not figure out
[35:22.360 --> 35:24.540]  how to call a car that wasn't eight blocks away.
[35:24.920 --> 35:28.500]  They called a car genuinely eight blocks away from the convention center.
[35:28.660 --> 35:29.600]  So we're walking.
[35:30.000 --> 35:30.980]  I've been out all day.
[35:31.040 --> 35:31.580]  It's hot.
[35:31.940 --> 35:32.900]  I'm exhausted.
[35:33.440 --> 35:34.760]  And it's just a nightmare.
[35:35.060 --> 35:39.060]  I had a whole thing with a homeless guy that I don't know if I should get into at this time.
[35:39.120 --> 35:40.120]  That was the whole story.
[35:40.580 --> 35:42.060]  It was like a Jerry Maguire moment.
[35:42.180 --> 35:43.180]  He was yelling at me.
[35:43.180 --> 35:44.620]  It was a weird friendship.
[35:45.060 --> 35:46.320]  He invited me to an orgy.
[35:46.480 --> 35:47.640]  It was a strange thing.
[35:48.220 --> 35:51.580]  But then we eventually get to the car and I thought I had heat sickness.
[35:52.180 --> 35:55.000]  Andrew, I don't know why I don't already know that story,
[35:55.100 --> 35:57.360]  but we are going to have to get into it at some point.
[35:57.580 --> 35:57.860]  Okay.
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.260]  I mean, we could get into it now.
[36:00.440 --> 36:01.500]  No, no, let's continue.
[36:01.700 --> 36:02.040]  Continue.
[36:02.180 --> 36:03.440]  Just I'm going to put a pin in that one.
[36:03.760 --> 36:04.180]  Anyway, okay.
[36:04.220 --> 36:05.220]  So we walk like eight.
[36:05.520 --> 36:06.680]  My friend was useless, too.
[36:06.820 --> 36:07.980]  Like he was with me the whole time.
[36:08.020 --> 36:09.040]  Didn't say a single thing.
[36:09.080 --> 36:09.920]  Didn't help me at all.
[36:10.020 --> 36:11.680]  While I'm getting invited to this homeless orgy.
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.440]  I may have sent it to a hotel that I didn't stay at because I didn't know what to do.
[36:15.620 --> 36:16.620]  It was very, it was intense.
[36:17.000 --> 36:17.620]  It's a weird story.
[36:17.900 --> 36:20.440]  Anyway, the point is I've been sick in Austin a lot.
[36:20.500 --> 36:21.280]  I guess I vomited.
[36:21.420 --> 36:23.800]  I thought I had heat stroke because I was walking eight blocks.
[36:23.900 --> 36:25.320]  But it was just I was super sick.
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.280]  Well, to be fair, Austin in July is about 312 degrees.
[36:29.860 --> 36:31.940]  So it would be easy to get heat stroke.
[36:31.980 --> 36:35.220]  I feel like the only times I've ever seen you in real life is in Austin.
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.980]  And I feel like you were just holding in the pain the entire time
[36:38.980 --> 36:40.500]  because you've always seemed fine.
[36:40.500 --> 36:44.200]  But you've probably rolled your ankle three times that day and thrown up.
[36:44.320 --> 36:45.300]  There was a time...
[36:45.300 --> 36:47.060]  I didn't try to burn a bottle, I fell down.
[36:47.620 --> 36:52.840]  Gavin, you have a role in a story that you don't know, I think.
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.460]  Oh, did I hurt you somehow?
[36:54.920 --> 36:56.420]  No, you did not hurt me.
[36:56.700 --> 36:58.140]  But I was in a spot.
[36:58.360 --> 36:59.400]  I was in a rough spot.
[36:59.580 --> 37:03.020]  It was a Fourth of July party at your house, Geoff.
[37:03.160 --> 37:03.920]  I remember this.
[37:03.920 --> 37:04.380]  It was hot.
[37:04.600 --> 37:06.560]  We handled this, though. We took care of this.
[37:06.740 --> 37:07.840]  We did. We were fine.
[37:07.840 --> 37:09.540]  But it was hot.
[37:09.640 --> 37:11.280]  And I'm talking to people I don't know.
[37:11.740 --> 37:13.480]  And all the good seats are taken.
[37:14.120 --> 37:15.560]  And I'm just like, I just want to sit down.
[37:15.620 --> 37:17.400]  But everyone's outside. It'd be weird to be inside.
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.180]  And then Geoff had these really plasticky old chairs.
[37:22.560 --> 37:23.820]  Oh, those things were shite.
[37:24.040 --> 37:25.320]  They were rickety old things.
[37:25.540 --> 37:28.000]  They were rickety old plastic chairs.
[37:29.060 --> 37:30.920]  And I think someone was using one.
[37:30.980 --> 37:31.700]  And they just got up.
[37:31.760 --> 37:32.420]  And I was like, oh, great.
[37:32.440 --> 37:33.360]  I'm going to go sit down.
[37:33.660 --> 37:34.120]  I'm tired.
[37:34.280 --> 37:35.420]  It's post-RTX.
[37:35.740 --> 37:36.500]  Just exhausted.
[37:37.040 --> 37:39.480]  And I miscalculated how low the chair was.
[37:39.620 --> 37:41.240]  So I kind of fell into it.
[37:41.300 --> 37:43.920]  And as soon as I fell into it, I heard a crack.
[37:44.260 --> 37:45.060]  The chair cracked.
[37:45.380 --> 37:47.140]  And everybody is outside.
[37:47.740 --> 37:50.580]  And it's like in a movie when somebody steps on a landmine.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.660]  And then they can't move.
[37:51.820 --> 37:52.700]  That's how I felt.
[37:52.880 --> 37:56.200]  I'm in this chair that could shatter at any moment.
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.020]  It would be incredibly embarrassing.
[37:58.320 --> 38:00.740]  But I just have to sit and not move.
[38:01.040 --> 38:01.720]  And that's all I did.
[38:01.760 --> 38:02.400]  I sat there.
[38:02.440 --> 38:03.020]  I didn't move.
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.300]  People would come in and out.
[38:04.500 --> 38:06.020]  I'd just look around a little bit.
[38:06.020 --> 38:09.420]  You, Dan, and Meg were at the part.
[38:09.480 --> 38:10.120]  You came over.
[38:10.240 --> 38:10.960]  You said hi.
[38:11.280 --> 38:13.220]  And I didn't get up out of the chair because I couldn't.
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.460]  And I felt weird to not stand up and be like, hey.
[38:15.820 --> 38:17.100]  And so we had a little talk.
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.760]  And you had no concept of the fear that was going through my mind.
[38:21.540 --> 38:24.700]  You were stood on a frozen lake right in the middle.
[38:24.920 --> 38:25.700]  But it was all cracked.
[38:26.140 --> 38:28.900]  Yeah, I was on a pane of glass that was slowly shattering.
[38:29.240 --> 38:30.360]  And there was no help.
[38:30.600 --> 38:31.920]  The worst part was...
[38:31.920 --> 38:33.620]  So I sat in that chair for like an hour.
[38:34.140 --> 38:34.940]  And then...
[38:37.920 --> 38:42.860]  Enough time had passed in the chair that you and everybody you were with had done talking.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  You finished your evening.
[38:44.140 --> 38:45.220]  You're done talking with everyone.
[38:45.340 --> 38:46.480]  And you decided to go home.
[38:46.860 --> 38:48.260]  And you walked over to say goodbye.
[38:48.640 --> 38:50.420]  And Meg put her hand on my shoulder.
[38:50.580 --> 38:52.320]  And it was the scariest moment of my life.
[38:52.500 --> 38:54.260]  It was an additional...
[38:54.260 --> 38:55.440]  There was extra weight.
[38:55.820 --> 38:56.660]  And it was like a nice...
[38:56.660 --> 38:58.140]  It was like, hey, it was nice seeing you.
[38:58.280 --> 39:00.260]  But in my head, it was like, this is gonna shatter.
[39:00.500 --> 39:01.100]  I'm done.
[39:01.380 --> 39:01.940]  You're gonna know.
[39:02.400 --> 39:04.740]  And so I stayed there until the evening.
[39:05.100 --> 39:06.520]  And everybody had left.
[39:06.580 --> 39:08.780]  And it was just Geoff and I at that point.
[39:08.860 --> 39:10.200]  You had to just wait everyone out.
[39:10.460 --> 39:12.340]  He sat there for like six hours.
[39:12.760 --> 39:15.060]  Gavin, this is the year that we had the pool.
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.280]  And Linda was there.
[39:16.400 --> 39:16.940]  And the whole thing.
[39:17.140 --> 39:18.800]  Yeah, that was a really fun day.
[39:18.960 --> 39:21.920]  We were in that backyard for 10 hours, probably.
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.060]  It was like two in the afternoon until the sun went down.
[39:26.240 --> 39:29.000]  Yeah, which is like 4 a.m. in Texas in the summer.
[39:30.240 --> 39:31.940]  So it's just Geoff and I at that point.
[39:32.020 --> 39:32.620]  We have a talk.
[39:32.720 --> 39:33.520]  We're talking for a bit.
[39:33.580 --> 39:35.160]  And he's like, well, you know, everyone's inside.
[39:35.220 --> 39:36.340]  I guess we should probably go.
[39:36.680 --> 39:38.020]  I was like, I gotta tell you something.
[39:40.280 --> 39:41.420]  I'm in a spot here.
[39:42.500 --> 39:44.260]  And I explained what had happened.
[39:44.640 --> 39:46.300]  He's like, well, you know, we'll just we'll figure it out.
[39:46.340 --> 39:46.560]  We'll see.
[39:46.620 --> 39:47.460]  Let's see what happens.
[39:47.760 --> 39:50.260]  I move like an inch and the chair shatters.
[39:50.400 --> 39:51.280]  It just falls.
[39:51.840 --> 39:52.480]  Fall over.
[39:53.120 --> 39:53.960]  It was perfect.
[39:54.080 --> 39:54.600]  I was right.
[39:54.680 --> 39:57.720]  It actually was a nice justification that I truly was trapped.
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.880]  And I never told a soul from that moment until now.
[40:03.160 --> 40:03.920]  No, I didn't.
[40:04.020 --> 40:05.000]  I wouldn't care if you did.
[40:05.120 --> 40:05.820]  It's a great story.
[40:06.320 --> 40:08.320]  Yeah, but it was your story to tell.
[40:08.840 --> 40:11.000]  Oh, oh, my God.
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.300]  And it's a shame, too, because we were having such a good time.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.300]  And I assume I thought you weren't having a good time.
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.860]  Because I was probably like, he doesn't really want to talk to me.
[40:23.920 --> 40:25.480]  He just doesn't want to stand up.
[40:25.480 --> 40:27.580]  He was just like sitting, smiling at people.
[40:30.600 --> 40:31.820]  What else did he do?
[40:31.840 --> 40:32.420]  Head nods.
[40:32.480 --> 40:33.780]  He was like, hey, what's up?
[40:33.900 --> 40:35.800]  He did that about 7,000 times.
[40:35.940 --> 40:38.420]  Lots of one word replies and then looking away.
[40:43.020 --> 40:43.680]  It was a good party.
[40:44.180 --> 40:45.120]  It was a good party.
[40:45.500 --> 40:46.160]  It was a good party.
[40:48.060 --> 40:48.860]  Good times.
[40:49.120 --> 40:50.200]  That hurts so bad.
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.640]  I'm not a good party guest, generally speaking, anyway.
[40:53.680 --> 40:55.400]  But that was a whole other level of fear.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.120]  That nobody else was aware of.
[40:57.200 --> 41:00.460]  According to my telephone, that was July 2016.
[41:01.060 --> 41:01.540]  Oh, wow.
[41:01.960 --> 41:02.580]  Does that sound about right?
[41:02.840 --> 41:03.140]  Sure.
[41:03.580 --> 41:05.060]  Oh, oh, man.
[41:05.460 --> 41:06.220]  Where does the time go?
[41:06.460 --> 41:08.100]  Oh, shit, Andrew, damn.
[41:08.100 --> 41:08.820]  What are we talking about?
[41:09.100 --> 41:13.780]  So from your point of view, though, as you said, you're not like the biggest party guy.
[41:14.160 --> 41:14.680]  No, not at all.
[41:14.680 --> 41:16.580]  And stuff just happens to you constantly.
[41:16.780 --> 41:19.620]  Was that like a normal overall experience for you?
[41:19.660 --> 41:22.120]  Or was that like one of the biggest nightmares of your life?
[41:22.480 --> 41:23.180]  No, it wasn't.
[41:23.180 --> 41:27.860]  Honestly, I think that was maybe the first like adult party I had gone to.
[41:28.120 --> 41:28.980]  So it was fun.
[41:29.260 --> 41:29.840]  I had a good time.
[41:30.460 --> 41:32.680]  I didn't have a lot to measure against.
[41:32.960 --> 41:34.280]  And I didn't mind the chair was fine.
[41:34.480 --> 41:35.620]  It was constant fear.
[41:35.820 --> 41:38.520]  But it was also an understanding of that.
[41:38.620 --> 41:39.980]  This is going to be a great story one day.
[41:40.120 --> 41:45.120]  I'm imagining in my head, you know, how like a party, if you if someone's got a camera
[41:45.120 --> 41:48.140]  and they set up a time-lapse and you see there's all the things of everyone.
[41:48.300 --> 41:51.060]  And they're like in this room, they're in that room and the sun's going down.
[41:51.060 --> 41:53.220]  But you're just in the chair all night.
[41:55.580 --> 41:57.740]  No, I don't think I even had a drink.
[41:57.880 --> 41:58.500]  It was.
[41:59.180 --> 42:00.800]  Yeah, I would have got you one.
[42:01.160 --> 42:02.900]  Well, I couldn't just say, hey, can you get that?
[42:02.960 --> 42:03.360]  Be weird.
[42:03.480 --> 42:04.560]  That'd be a weird thing to say.
[42:04.640 --> 42:07.100]  I couldn't in any way that I'm already up.
[42:08.000 --> 42:08.340]  You're all.
[42:08.500 --> 42:10.280]  Everyone was essentially already up.
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.240]  There is no like five people down at like a bench.
[42:14.340 --> 42:16.440]  You're a fire and everyone else.
[42:17.220 --> 42:17.900]  Everyone else is up.
[42:18.760 --> 42:19.280]  Oh, God.
[42:19.340 --> 42:20.640]  I will say this.
[42:20.640 --> 42:25.820]  One nice thing about skipping the recording last week, which I guess I'm ruining right now,
[42:25.820 --> 42:30.000]  is I was not looking forward to one of the last things we talked about.
[42:30.380 --> 42:33.060]  The previous episode was that I had to go sell your car, Gavin.
[42:33.440 --> 42:34.940]  I was going to trade it in for a new car.
[42:35.320 --> 42:35.840]  How'd it go?
[42:36.360 --> 42:39.400]  Well, I was afraid you guys were going to ask me how the new car was.
[42:39.500 --> 42:41.920]  And it was at that moment in the shop getting fixed.
[42:44.180 --> 42:46.720]  Exactly one week later, it was back in the shop.
[42:47.260 --> 42:49.100]  Did you buy someone's broken car?
[42:49.100 --> 42:51.100]  No, I bought a 2019.
[42:51.780 --> 42:55.120]  It just needed to have like the clear coat.
[42:55.360 --> 42:58.780]  I bought this like special clear coat for the for the outside and the
[42:59.420 --> 43:01.400]  inside to help it be more protected.
[43:02.100 --> 43:04.900]  And then then I had to get the brakes worked on.
[43:05.000 --> 43:05.720]  They were a little squeaky.
[43:06.140 --> 43:07.760]  But the timing was just impeccable.
[43:07.820 --> 43:08.560]  It was like that morning.
[43:08.620 --> 43:15.460]  I was like, oh, the as a matter of fact, in similar funny fashion, I drove it this morning.
[43:15.460 --> 43:20.080]  And when I got into it, it gave me an alert that the brakes need to be checked again.
[43:23.860 --> 43:26.100]  I feel like you may have bought me another money pit.
[43:27.640 --> 43:30.720]  Well, this time I bought you a money pit with a five year
[43:31.360 --> 43:32.860]  everything warranty that I paid a lot of.
[43:32.880 --> 43:35.580]  I paid about what it cost me to fix the old money pit this summer.
[43:36.660 --> 43:38.700]  I got a great trade in on that money pit, though.
[43:39.700 --> 43:40.420]  And nice.
[43:40.900 --> 43:41.640]  You're going to love you.
[43:41.680 --> 43:42.600]  You're going to love your new car.
[43:42.700 --> 43:43.260]  It's beautiful.
[43:43.700 --> 43:45.040]  I'm excited to eventually see it.
[43:45.040 --> 43:48.300]  I'm excited to get to drive it once it's not in the shop.
[43:48.460 --> 43:49.760]  I'm excited to walk.
[43:52.580 --> 43:55.760]  So what are you going to do long term about your ankles?
[43:55.960 --> 43:57.420]  Because you're in the prime of life.
[43:57.700 --> 44:03.680]  Like your life and the youthfulness of your body won't ever get any better than it is now.
[44:03.780 --> 44:05.020]  Now, yeah, it's downhill from here.
[44:05.460 --> 44:05.860]  Absolutely.
[44:06.440 --> 44:07.000]  I've had this.
[44:07.140 --> 44:09.500]  This is like maybe the 12th time I've had this injury.
[44:09.720 --> 44:10.600]  This isn't the worst one.
[44:10.720 --> 44:11.220]  So I'll be fine.
[44:11.600 --> 44:12.440]  It just takes a little time.
[44:12.440 --> 44:16.420]  When I worked at an electrical warehouse, I had this for a little over a month
[44:16.420 --> 44:18.560]  because I could never get enough time to heal it.
[44:19.020 --> 44:20.220]  I didn't want to take time off work.
[44:20.500 --> 44:22.760]  So just for a month and a half, I was limping everywhere.
[44:22.900 --> 44:23.800]  I was sitting on carps.
[44:24.100 --> 44:24.980]  It was terrible.
[44:25.500 --> 44:27.960]  Is it possible?
[44:28.980 --> 44:30.120]  And I'm just throwing this out there.
[44:30.240 --> 44:30.520]  Go ahead.
[44:31.500 --> 44:35.880]  Once you're feeling better, like maybe three weeks to a month down the road,
[44:36.580 --> 44:38.080]  everything's A-OK with your ankle.
[44:38.160 --> 44:38.980]  You're feeling great.
[44:39.510 --> 44:44.880]  You go to a physical therapist and start doing something to strengthen it
[44:44.880 --> 44:45.900]  so it doesn't happen again?
[44:46.320 --> 44:49.560]  Yeah, I mean, that would be the smart thing to do.
[44:50.060 --> 44:52.240]  I should at least learn how to wrap my ankle.
[44:52.320 --> 44:53.160]  I don't know how to do that.
[44:53.380 --> 44:56.920]  And I say this as a guy who did four months of physical therapy on his shoulder
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.480]  for the end result to be,
[44:59.380 --> 45:01.680]  yeah, your shoulder's just going to suck for the rest of your life
[45:01.680 --> 45:02.980]  because you're old and have arthritis.
[45:03.480 --> 45:06.120]  So I'm not saying that the solution is a solution,
[45:06.280 --> 45:07.760]  but it's maybe worth exploring.
[45:07.880 --> 45:08.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[45:08.580 --> 45:10.920]  I think it's a good thing to attempt to explore.
[45:11.720 --> 45:18.960]  That was the bottom of the warehouse was like a month and a half of limping everywhere
[45:19.540 --> 45:21.380]  and just it being being terrible.
[45:21.620 --> 45:22.440]  I cried.
[45:23.060 --> 45:26.680]  There was a guy who worked there who was like a retired hockey player
[45:26.680 --> 45:29.340]  who was like really tough, like guy's guy, not emotional in any way.
[45:29.600 --> 45:35.460]  And I cried with my shitty, ugly foot on his lap as he rolled my ankle.
[45:35.460 --> 45:42.260]  It was it was a great, great low, but it's fine.
[45:42.400 --> 45:42.940]  It'll be good.
[45:43.580 --> 45:47.920]  I eventually that healed and it takes a little more than a week,
[45:48.060 --> 45:48.800]  but then I'm good to go.
[45:48.980 --> 45:50.020]  I have a dilemma, though.
[45:50.280 --> 45:52.020]  I have a few things to still talk about this.
[45:52.300 --> 45:53.500]  I broke my phone.
[45:54.260 --> 45:55.340]  I shattered my phone.
[45:55.620 --> 45:56.400]  It's not shattered.
[45:56.640 --> 45:57.680]  I put a hole in it.
[45:58.000 --> 45:58.980]  The glass is cracked.
[45:59.440 --> 46:02.620]  It's OK, though, but it might be the dumbest phone break.
[46:03.240 --> 46:04.240]  Certainly, I've ever had.
[46:04.240 --> 46:06.100]  What does that mean for all the bits inside?
[46:06.400 --> 46:07.640]  The bits are still fine.
[46:07.760 --> 46:08.860]  They're safely secure.
[46:09.980 --> 46:12.480]  But it was such an effort to, like, get up.
[46:12.580 --> 46:15.280]  My bathroom is only maybe eight feet from my bed.
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.600]  And it was this whole process every time for the first few days after the dog disaster.
[46:19.820 --> 46:20.960]  It was a real struggle.
[46:21.480 --> 46:23.660]  And it sometimes would be hard to even leave.
[46:23.780 --> 46:25.680]  So I'd always want to bring my phone with me.
[46:25.680 --> 46:28.480]  So I'd have something to communicate with or just even entertain myself.
[46:28.940 --> 46:30.580]  So every time I'd go to the bathroom,
[46:30.580 --> 46:33.320]  I needed both hands to pull myself there.
[46:33.500 --> 46:37.320]  So I put the phone in my teeth, kind of like that.
[46:37.440 --> 46:40.600]  That was the move I was doing for transporting the phone.
[46:41.020 --> 46:43.280]  And I heard a crack one day.
[46:43.720 --> 46:44.740]  I didn't think much of it.
[46:45.040 --> 46:45.900]  I bit too hard.
[46:46.020 --> 46:47.060]  I bit a hole into my phone.
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.240]  The glass has a little tooth hole at the top of it.
[46:51.640 --> 46:57.200]  I was expecting it to slip out of your mouth.
[46:57.560 --> 46:57.920]  No.
[46:59.880 --> 47:01.360]  No, it was not.
[47:01.380 --> 47:02.640]  I was not going to let that thing fall.
[47:02.640 --> 47:04.140]  I got a good bite on it.
[47:04.240 --> 47:04.520]  Gavin.
[47:04.640 --> 47:10.000]  Imagine you biting a hole through your phone, stepping over waffle makers, dog toasters.
[47:10.640 --> 47:12.020]  Dodging flying hot dogs.
[47:12.880 --> 47:17.080]  You have everything in your capacity to make your life totally normal.
[47:17.120 --> 47:20.160]  And you refuse at every junction, at every opportunity.
[47:20.600 --> 47:21.600]  You make your life weird.
[47:21.880 --> 47:23.140]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:23.140 --> 47:32.480]  Gavin, if I gave you an hour and $1,000 if you could bite a hole into your phone with your own mouth,
[47:32.860 --> 47:35.840]  do you think you could- do you think you have it in you to do that?
[47:36.820 --> 47:39.760]  I don't think I could bring myself to give it enough beans.
[47:39.900 --> 47:41.340]  I'd be so worried about cutting myself.
[47:41.580 --> 47:41.900]  I mean-
[47:41.900 --> 47:45.500]  Or, yeah, there's no way in hell I could chew into a phone.
[47:45.700 --> 47:46.940]  Yeah, it's glass and metal.
[47:47.020 --> 47:48.160]  I think I'd break a tooth.
[47:48.460 --> 47:49.800]  Oh, your tooth would be gone.
[47:50.180 --> 47:51.400]  How did you-
[47:51.400 --> 47:54.500]  Do you have like, do you have like Moonraker Jaws teeth?
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.780]  I mean, to be fair, it's near where there already was a crack,
[47:58.900 --> 48:01.140]  but there used to only be one hole and now there's two holes.
[48:01.380 --> 48:02.740]  Wasn't that Spy Who Loved Me Jaws?
[48:03.240 --> 48:04.360]  Oh, was that Spy Who Loved Me Jaws?
[48:04.420 --> 48:04.820]  Yeah, sorry.
[48:05.380 --> 48:07.180]  And by the way, Gavin, we haven't talked.
[48:07.260 --> 48:07.860]  My condolences.
[48:08.560 --> 48:09.520]  Oh, Sean Connery?
[48:09.740 --> 48:11.440]  Yeah, I know you got to be pretty sad about that.
[48:11.840 --> 48:12.460]  Yeah, that was sad.
[48:12.820 --> 48:15.940]  If it makes you feel any better, Andrew and I had a- we suffered a loss together
[48:15.940 --> 48:17.960]  that we have been debating on whether we talk about.
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.180]  But but first, you were going to say something more about you're chewing through your phone.
[48:22.560 --> 48:25.700]  Like, I mean, I put a hole in it and it's not that hard to do.
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.020]  So be careful if if someone listening tries that mode of transportation,
[48:30.020 --> 48:34.040]  which I'm sure isn't going to happen, but just throwing it out there.
[48:34.100 --> 48:36.160]  Was it your top teeth or your bottom?
[48:36.380 --> 48:37.420]  Top teeth. Top teeth.
[48:37.540 --> 48:38.180]  Top teeth. Okay.
[48:38.360 --> 48:39.040]  Yeah. Yeah.
[48:39.400 --> 48:40.680]  I think the pointy one.
[48:40.960 --> 48:42.440]  Why were you biting so hard?
[48:42.680 --> 48:44.400]  Because I didn't want it to fall out of my mouth.
[48:44.640 --> 48:45.700]  And shatter.
[48:45.700 --> 48:49.060]  Every every single inch, Gavin, I'm going.
[48:51.620 --> 48:55.220]  So it's like a bit of leather when someone's getting their legs torn off.
[48:55.500 --> 48:59.120]  Yeah, I didn't I didn't want like that sort of also was a perk of it.
[48:59.180 --> 49:00.160]  But yeah, it was constant.
[49:00.520 --> 49:04.620]  I had to move my phone, but I also was in extreme pain and wanted to yell about it
[49:04.620 --> 49:06.560]  every second of my journey.
[49:06.940 --> 49:09.200]  Okay, I have a one word question.
[49:09.460 --> 49:09.780]  Go ahead.
[49:10.080 --> 49:10.300]  Pocket.
[49:10.780 --> 49:12.600]  Okay, that's that's another thing.
[49:12.600 --> 49:16.200]  It was I went bottomless during this whole run.
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.000]  It was just too much effort to put bottoms on and off that hurt.
[49:21.100 --> 49:22.900]  I had to lift my leg up every time.
[49:23.220 --> 49:25.100]  So you weren't wearing boxes?
[49:25.660 --> 49:26.240]  No, nothing.
[49:26.380 --> 49:28.880]  I went complete bottomless during this entire injury.
[49:29.080 --> 49:32.680]  So you're just running around like Winnie the Pooh this whole time?
[49:33.000 --> 49:33.500]  Yeah, I was.
[49:33.800 --> 49:34.960]  I was Winnie the Poohing it up.
[49:35.260 --> 49:41.940]  You're participating in the dicks out, two ankle busted obstacle course
[49:41.940 --> 49:43.560]  with an iPhone in your mouth.
[49:44.480 --> 49:45.620]  Absolutely, I was.
[49:45.980 --> 49:47.340]  I heard that's the new Spartan games.
[49:47.640 --> 49:48.860]  Oh my god.
[49:49.400 --> 49:50.920]  Yeah, bottomless.
[49:51.160 --> 49:53.280]  So how long were you without pants?
[49:54.480 --> 49:57.720]  I put I put underwear on for the first time yesterday.
[50:02.740 --> 50:04.620]  Yesterday was it was bad.
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.460]  Yesterday is the first day I had a bath or a shower since the injury too.
[50:09.840 --> 50:11.000]  I was scared.
[50:11.720 --> 50:14.740]  I was scared I wouldn't be able to get out of the tub, but it was a risk.
[50:14.820 --> 50:15.460]  I had to take it.
[50:15.540 --> 50:16.620]  It had been too long.
[50:16.960 --> 50:17.820]  I felt gross.
[50:18.160 --> 50:19.780]  Did that become pungent over time?
[50:20.620 --> 50:21.940]  It wasn't a concern.
[50:22.560 --> 50:23.180]  If I know.
[50:23.660 --> 50:24.140]  Yeah, I wasn't.
[50:24.220 --> 50:25.260]  That wasn't a big issue.
[50:25.320 --> 50:26.040]  I had other problems.
[50:28.100 --> 50:30.900]  It sounds like you've got a lot of other problems, buddy.
[50:31.060 --> 50:31.960]  Oh, I had another one.
[50:32.000 --> 50:32.620]  Should I include?
[50:32.780 --> 50:35.000]  I mean, we should probably wrap up.
[50:35.480 --> 50:37.320]  You could tell us in the next one if it.
[50:37.320 --> 50:38.620]  Because we're rolling.
[50:39.580 --> 50:42.700]  OK, well, we continue my last.
[50:42.820 --> 50:43.560]  I had a real problem.
[50:43.720 --> 50:45.480]  I have a few other issues that came from this.
[50:45.940 --> 50:51.020]  But I think I think we should talk about our loss, Geoff, because it is a meaningful.
[50:51.560 --> 50:53.660]  We lost a meaningful figure to our lives.
[50:53.920 --> 51:00.400]  And I would say more so to our relationship than than like is where I feel the loss.
[51:00.560 --> 51:04.220]  Oh, before before we end, though, I'm going to say we never did it.
[51:04.220 --> 51:06.720]  So welcome to Face episode something.
[51:07.180 --> 51:08.400]  I don't know what episode this is.
[51:08.480 --> 51:09.700]  Twenty twenty five.
[51:09.960 --> 51:10.260]  Twenty five.
[51:10.400 --> 51:11.180]  Welcome to fuck.
[51:12.900 --> 51:16.840]  Oh, I don't know what happened there.
[51:16.980 --> 51:18.820]  Welcome to Face episode twenty five.
[51:18.940 --> 51:19.860]  I'm your host, Geoff Ramsey.
[51:19.860 --> 51:22.200]  With me, as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Pantin.
[51:22.320 --> 51:25.040]  Andrew, I believe you you're a phone eater now.
[51:25.120 --> 51:25.580]  That's interesting.
[51:26.080 --> 51:26.960]  We'll get into that.
[51:27.320 --> 51:28.360]  And then we just did.
[51:28.980 --> 51:29.260]  Yeah.
[51:29.340 --> 51:33.860]  So let's dedicate this episode to to Sean Connery, but also to the great Tommy Heinsen,
[51:33.860 --> 51:35.960]  Gavin, you have no idea who he is.
[51:36.840 --> 51:41.680]  He was he has an interesting, a really unique and interesting legacy.
[51:42.180 --> 51:47.420]  He was initially a player for the Boston Celtics, and then he became a coach for the Boston Celtics.
[51:47.780 --> 51:52.180]  And then he became an announcer for the Boston Celtics.
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.040]  And so he has the distinction of being in the Hall of Fame as a Hall of Fame player
[51:57.040 --> 51:58.940]  and a Hall of Fame coach.
[51:59.640 --> 52:03.260]  And the Radio Hall of Fame is bullshit or the I don't know what the announcer Hall of Fame
[52:03.260 --> 52:05.360]  but he's a very distinguished announcer.
[52:05.560 --> 52:12.460]  He was in the Celtics organization for 60 years and is the only person on fucking earth
[52:12.460 --> 52:17.800]  who was a member of the Boston Celtics for all 17 of their championships,
[52:18.240 --> 52:20.160]  which is unbelievable to think about.
[52:20.460 --> 52:23.780]  Over 60 years, the Celtics won until this year when the Lakers won.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.020]  They had the most championships ever with 17.
[52:26.600 --> 52:27.500]  Now it's tied.
[52:27.840 --> 52:30.020]  And Tommy was there for every single one of them.
[52:30.020 --> 52:34.180]  The reason it's important to Andrew and I, I mean, because we loved him,
[52:34.500 --> 52:37.440]  is because, you know, there was that period where Andrew thought I hated him for a couple
[52:37.440 --> 52:39.460]  of years for some reason, and we just didn't talk.
[52:40.180 --> 52:42.500]  It was basketball that brought us back together.
[52:42.840 --> 52:45.980]  And he and I, he was looking to get into basketball.
[52:46.260 --> 52:47.520]  I recommended the Celtics.
[52:47.800 --> 52:53.320]  He did this very Andrew thing where he went to every NBA team's subreddit and made a post
[52:53.320 --> 52:55.440]  that said, I'm looking about getting into basketball.
[52:55.580 --> 52:58.220]  Tell me why I should vote, why I should be a fan of your team.
[52:58.280 --> 52:58.900]  I was a free agent.
[52:58.900 --> 53:01.360]  Which went about, he was a free agent, which went about as well as you'd expect.
[53:01.660 --> 53:05.940]  Anyway, he fell in love with the Celtics, and he and I used to bond over all the,
[53:06.180 --> 53:10.680]  just the ludicrous, crazy, wacky shit that Tommy used to say.
[53:10.900 --> 53:15.680]  And I would say that Tommy, he was a focal point of bringing us back together and
[53:15.680 --> 53:19.040]  like reigniting our friendship that you were hiding from me.
[53:19.760 --> 53:21.440]  I didn't realize you ever broke up.
[53:21.780 --> 53:24.200]  I didn't either until like three episodes ago.
[53:25.180 --> 53:27.020]  No, I wouldn't say it was a breakup.
[53:27.020 --> 53:30.080]  There was maybe like a year and a half where I didn't talk to anybody.
[53:30.520 --> 53:30.760]  Yeah.
[53:30.780 --> 53:33.280]  That was with you guys or part of the company.
[53:33.500 --> 53:39.740]  But yeah, what made Tommy so special is that we would watch and when I say watch,
[53:39.760 --> 53:40.580]  I meant to look.
[53:40.680 --> 53:43.420]  Do you do you remember how early it was into that season?
[53:44.020 --> 53:48.040]  It was the post Isaiah Thomas season, the season after that.
[53:48.240 --> 53:51.460]  I want to say it was like, yeah, 12 games or 13 games in.
[53:51.880 --> 53:54.320]  Yeah, I just decided I was going to follow the Celtics.
[53:54.380 --> 53:55.600]  I'd been doing so casually.
[53:55.600 --> 53:58.500]  And then they played Golden State.
[53:58.680 --> 54:00.480]  And we're talking about that early in the day.
[54:00.560 --> 54:04.220]  And Geoff and I watched like the entire game together over Slack,
[54:04.360 --> 54:05.980]  just messaging things back and forth.
[54:06.120 --> 54:09.620]  And we did that for like essentially every game of that season.
[54:09.840 --> 54:10.220]  I want to say.
[54:10.420 --> 54:12.880]  Yeah, we watched almost every game together.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.480]  The only ones that we like, if one of us had to travel or something, we could.
[54:17.080 --> 54:22.160]  And Tommy was just such a great focal point because he's such a ridiculous character.
[54:22.160 --> 54:24.460]  And as somebody who was trying to get into basketball,
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.620]  he was like this, not even like human figure.
[54:28.740 --> 54:31.360]  Like you just imagine that when he wasn't calling games,
[54:31.400 --> 54:34.000]  he was in a diner talking about the team constantly.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.960]  Like you didn't have a life beyond like him and Mike, who is his partner,
[54:38.500 --> 54:40.420]  just talking about the team.
[54:40.580 --> 54:44.180]  And he had such a bias for the team that it was wonderful.
[54:44.180 --> 54:50.100]  Like it was such an extreme, irrational hatred for both refs
[54:50.100 --> 54:53.400]  and any player on any other team that it was wonderful.
[54:53.400 --> 54:55.540]  It was so much fun to listen to his games.
[54:56.020 --> 55:01.120]  It's going to be a real miss because he had moved away like last season, I think.
[55:01.460 --> 55:03.860]  I mean, before COVID, he was only doing like home games.
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.540]  And even then it was like every few home games.
[55:07.040 --> 55:09.700]  And then sometimes it was only some of the game as well.
[55:09.740 --> 55:11.840]  Like he was he died at 86. He's pretty old.
[55:11.900 --> 55:12.080]  Yeah.
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.260]  And he so he wasn't like an every every game figure anymore.
[55:16.260 --> 55:21.500]  But man, did we have a lot of fun laughing at the wild Homer shit that he would say?
[55:21.500 --> 55:22.740]  Just not even the home.
[55:22.860 --> 55:27.000]  Just like the way he'd phrase things or his unwillingness to go with jokes.
[55:27.180 --> 55:30.160]  Like I remember there's this time where it was like a three man booth
[55:30.160 --> 55:33.940]  and you could tell they're kind of getting ready to transition Tommy out of his role.
[55:34.340 --> 55:35.920]  And they were having some argument.
[55:36.260 --> 55:40.460]  And the third guy and Mike wanted to do this thing where he pretended that like Tommy hit him.
[55:41.320 --> 55:43.180]  And he's like, oh, my foot.
[55:43.260 --> 55:45.480]  And then Tommy just said, I didn't do nothing.
[55:47.220 --> 55:49.700]  He didn't play into it at all.
[55:49.700 --> 55:50.820]  It was just moments like that.
[55:51.100 --> 55:51.840]  It's fantastic.
[55:52.260 --> 55:54.540]  He saw this this there was a he doesn't play for us.
[55:54.600 --> 55:55.660]  Anybody plays for the Phoenix Suns.
[55:55.680 --> 55:59.160]  But there was this Australian player played center for us named Aaron Baines,
[55:59.320 --> 56:04.180]  who you actually Nick used to play for your San Antonio Spurs, I believe.
[56:04.200 --> 56:06.140]  And I think maybe even has a ring with them.
[56:06.300 --> 56:09.560]  And apparently his dick is the size of a Buick.
[56:09.760 --> 56:11.880]  And Tommy saw him in the shower.
[56:12.140 --> 56:16.040]  And he talked about that guy's dick every game,
[56:16.040 --> 56:21.540]  every time Aaron Baines had the ball or made any kind of a defensive play.
[56:21.740 --> 56:23.800]  Tommy found a way to talk about that guy's dick.
[56:23.920 --> 56:24.860]  It was so funny.
[56:25.140 --> 56:28.640]  It felt like it changed their dynamic in like how he'd call him.
[56:28.960 --> 56:31.420]  Like he didn't even say he wasn't specific.
[56:31.720 --> 56:33.640]  He said, I believe his line at the time was,
[56:34.080 --> 56:36.240]  I was watching Baines in the shower earlier.
[56:36.660 --> 56:38.800]  And boy, does that guy look like all of Australia.
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.840]  And he said it in such a way.
[56:41.220 --> 56:43.400]  And then every time Baines would play,
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.460]  he just seemed to have like an additional level of love for Baines.
[56:46.560 --> 56:49.680]  He had a new appreciation for Aaron Baines, which was amazing.
[56:50.200 --> 56:52.920]  There's another player named Daniel Tice, who is German.
[56:53.360 --> 56:55.700]  And he got fouled out one game just like playing.
[56:55.900 --> 56:58.580]  Like there was nothing crazy about the calls, but he got fouled out.
[56:58.960 --> 57:02.940]  And Tommy just yelled like four seconds after the call had happened.
[57:03.180 --> 57:04.900]  He just screamed at the top of his lungs.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.280]  That ref hates Germans.
[57:06.840 --> 57:07.980]  There's no other point.
[57:08.140 --> 57:09.820]  There's no like basis for that.
[57:10.220 --> 57:11.120]  He's just amazing.
[57:11.540 --> 57:12.260]  He will be missed.
[57:12.260 --> 57:13.860]  Anyway, he will be very missed.
[57:14.020 --> 57:17.960]  And Andrew and I got really choked up the other day when he died and we talked about it.
[57:18.260 --> 57:19.680]  That's our sincere moment.
[57:20.340 --> 57:21.980]  That's the end of this fucking episode.
[57:22.460 --> 57:27.200]  I don't think I've laughed so hard in a recording in like four years.
[57:27.720 --> 57:31.500]  Dude, I had to walk away from my mic at one point because I was crying.
[57:32.060 --> 57:34.460]  Yeah, that was pretty intense.
[57:34.800 --> 57:36.760]  I think I can make Gavin vomit next episode.
[57:37.400 --> 57:38.360]  Oh, you probably could.
[57:38.860 --> 57:43.840]  Yeah, I have two funny-ish things, but they're not vomit funny.
[57:44.100 --> 57:45.220]  But I look forward to it.
[57:45.220 --> 57:46.640]  No, this isn't vomit funny either.
[57:46.760 --> 57:48.860]  I just think Gavin's going to vomit when he sees this.
[57:50.560 --> 57:51.340]  Oh, God.
[57:51.520 --> 57:51.740]  All right.
[57:51.880 --> 57:52.940]  Well, that was F*** Face.
[57:53.500 --> 57:59.580]  Rate and subscribe and like and tell your friends and buy a t-shirt for your mom.
[58:01.460 --> 58:03.740]  Garpel and all that other bullshit.
[58:04.060 --> 58:07.100]  Oh, and guess what I just got in the fucking mail.
[58:07.100 --> 58:13.320]  Do you know how I convinced them to make us F*** Face baseball bats?
[58:14.300 --> 58:14.860]  Yes.
[58:16.600 --> 58:20.340]  At your extreme urging to the contrary.
[58:21.440 --> 58:25.780]  I'm going to hand F*** Face every one of them and they're going to come with a certificate
[58:25.780 --> 58:30.740]  of authenticity. And the certificate of authenticity looks suspiciously like a
[58:30.740 --> 58:35.900]  certain baseball card style. And it has like a little message. And then I'm going to Sharpie
[58:35.900 --> 58:40.540]  sign each one as the authenticity. And those came in the mail yesterday. So I have a bunch of
[58:40.540 --> 58:44.520]  baseball cards to sign. No, the bats don't come till next year. But I got the cards of
[58:44.520 --> 58:46.240]  authenticity. So I'm going to sign each one.
[58:46.560 --> 58:47.640]  Takes a year to make a bat.
[58:48.020 --> 58:50.380]  Takes a while to get them from wherever the fuck they got them from.
[58:50.560 --> 58:52.560]  Are you going to sign the bats too or are you just signing the cards?
[58:52.720 --> 58:57.120]  Yeah, so the bats are like novelty bats. And they say they have like the F*** Face logo
[58:57.120 --> 59:00.140]  on the like where the Louisville Slugger logo is on the fat part of the bat.
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.440]  And then on the bottom, they don't do custom engravings.
[59:04.440 --> 59:08.080]  Like nobody on Earth does custom engravings on bats that aren't full size, I guess.
[59:08.280 --> 59:15.280]  And so I'm going to hand F*** Face, just write F*** Face, but with the stars on every bat.
[59:15.400 --> 59:19.400]  And then we'll include a baseball card with my signature authenticated.
[59:19.600 --> 59:20.640]  So wait, it's a small bat?
[59:21.100 --> 59:22.600]  Uh, it's like 18 inches, maybe.
[59:23.020 --> 59:24.700]  And how? So what's the point of it?
[59:24.980 --> 59:25.780]  So people can buy it.
[59:25.880 --> 59:27.540]  To hit balls with it or just to have it?
[59:27.680 --> 59:28.860]  Just to have it. Just like collectible.
[59:29.020 --> 59:29.540]  Little fun thing.
[59:29.600 --> 59:31.380]  Why don't just sell the stump, the handle?
[59:31.800 --> 59:35.080]  Nobody wants to just buy a knob. What are you talking about?
[59:35.220 --> 59:36.620]  You want me to just sell the knob?
[59:37.320 --> 59:40.120]  Well, that's the bit that's got the F*** Face on it.
[59:40.760 --> 59:41.960]  Yeah, that's the whole aim now.
[59:42.500 --> 59:43.620]  Nobody's buying knobs.
[59:43.960 --> 59:48.760]  Look, think of 200 bats, how big that is, and then think about 200 bat knobs.
[59:49.540 --> 59:53.820]  Yeah, but if you bought just a knob, Gavin, you'd be like, where's the rest of this bat?
[59:54.180 --> 59:57.440]  That's you'd feel like you got screwed over. It's a bad investment.
[59:57.900 --> 59:59.160]  I don't want the whole rest of it.
[59:59.740 --> 01:00:02.800]  Nobody just wants the knob. You're full of shit.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.820]  Jesus Christ. I don't even know where to go with that.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:08.780]  I think we should just end.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.520]  That's it. All right. All right.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.020]  Face out.
