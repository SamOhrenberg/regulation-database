[00:00.460 --> 00:02.640]  This episode is brought to you by Corona.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.420]  When you're on a beach with an ice-cold Corona in hand,
[00:05.600 --> 00:06.860]  how can you not feel centered?
[00:07.080 --> 00:08.980]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[00:09.280 --> 00:12.320]  That's because whether after work, at barbecues, or at a bar,
[00:12.540 --> 00:13.940]  with just a squeeze of lime,
[00:14.060 --> 00:16.160]  Corona brings you La Playa mentality.
[00:16.620 --> 00:18.480]  Because while we all want the beach life,
[00:18.780 --> 00:21.000]  paradise doesn't always have palm trees.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.440]  Corona. La Playa awaits.

[00:27.400 --> 00:29.040]  Imported by Crown Imports Chicago, Illinois.
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.720]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.280]  Hello, and welcome to episode 26 of F*** Face.
[00:51.360 --> 00:54.860]  Hard to believe, feels like just yesterday we were at episode 16.
[00:56.400 --> 00:58.100]  Andrew and Gavin, how are you guys doing?
[00:58.460 --> 00:59.160]  Not bad, man.
[00:59.320 --> 01:02.040]  About as good as I was five minutes ago.
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.960]  Yeah, it's been about 30 seconds since we talked.
[01:04.420 --> 01:05.620]  I don't think we were recording,
[01:05.780 --> 01:07.820]  but Gavin and I were making lots of fun of you
[01:07.820 --> 01:10.580]  because you, I guess you do the podcast on an abacus?
[01:10.860 --> 01:11.860]  My computer's old.
[01:12.540 --> 01:13.840]  I don't think it's...
[01:13.840 --> 01:15.500]  If you guys have any advice
[01:15.500 --> 01:17.180]  outside of making fun of my old computer
[01:17.180 --> 01:19.140]  of how I can make it go faster, I'd take that.
[01:19.180 --> 01:19.880]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:19.940 --> 01:22.280]  I press stop on Audacity on my computer.
[01:22.480 --> 01:24.220]  Like on all my computers, this is the same way.
[01:25.260 --> 01:26.680]  And we usually go for about an hour.
[01:26.780 --> 01:29.420]  It takes about three to four seconds to export.
[01:29.900 --> 01:31.540]  And then I upload it, just drag it and drop it.
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.880]  You somehow export it over three minutes.
[01:34.880 --> 01:37.720]  It was two minute 51 upload or export.
[01:38.020 --> 01:39.560]  I have no control over that.
[01:39.640 --> 01:41.520]  It's not like I'm failing in any capacity.
[01:41.660 --> 01:42.240]  It's the computer.
[01:42.680 --> 01:43.460]  How am I failing?
[01:43.740 --> 01:44.460]  I'm doing everything.
[01:44.820 --> 01:46.340]  Well, I'd just say something must be wrong.
[01:46.460 --> 01:47.480]  Like, I don't have...
[01:47.480 --> 01:50.220]  You don't need like an overly fast computer to save an audio file.
[01:50.520 --> 01:51.320]  It's just a WAV file.
[01:51.540 --> 01:54.460]  I mean, you have seen my desktop and nothing has changed.
[01:54.540 --> 01:57.740]  If anything, it's probably gotten worse since I last shared it.
[01:58.200 --> 01:59.320]  So, I mean, there's some reasons.
[01:59.640 --> 02:00.880]  Did you ever find the hot dogs?
[02:01.020 --> 02:04.860]  Is there a chance that there's a hot dog wedged in your computer somewhere?
[02:04.860 --> 02:07.640]  Do we want to be real honest about this?
[02:08.180 --> 02:08.800]  Do we want to be honest?
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.180]  I would like to be honest.
[02:10.220 --> 02:14.300]  I recovered the dogs that went missing and those were the dogs I ate later in the evening.
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.300]  Oh, come on.
[02:16.500 --> 02:17.980]  Where did you find them?
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.940]  You flung them across your bedroom.
[02:20.160 --> 02:23.240]  They landed in some corner and then you dusted them off and ate them?
[02:23.280 --> 02:24.620]  They were under my desk.
[02:25.020 --> 02:26.940]  They were under my desk, I grabbed them.
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.540]  Come on, that's a grubby spot.
[02:28.960 --> 02:31.820]  Where your unwashed, dirty ankle is?
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.480]  Yeah, that's like foot dust.
[02:33.480 --> 02:35.780]  That's fecal particles from your foot.
[02:36.280 --> 02:36.660]  That's mean.
[02:36.940 --> 02:38.600]  I'm cooking waffles in the bathroom.
[02:38.720 --> 02:40.400]  You're yelling at me about fecal particles.
[02:40.520 --> 02:42.380]  I'm dropping stuff in my bedroom.
[02:42.540 --> 02:44.060]  You're yelling at me about fecal particles.
[02:44.380 --> 02:45.400]  I don't know how to make you laugh.
[02:45.520 --> 02:47.840]  Because everywhere in your bedroom is fecal.
[02:47.940 --> 02:48.640]  That's my point.
[02:48.960 --> 02:50.200]  Why are you yelling at me about it?
[02:50.200 --> 02:51.960]  I can't do nothing about the fecal particles.
[02:52.140 --> 02:52.440]  They're everywhere.
[02:52.820 --> 02:57.400]  If you prepare some nice dogs in your dog toaster and then eat them fresh out of the toaster,
[02:57.920 --> 03:00.740]  there's less fecal on that than if they've rolled across your door.
[03:01.560 --> 03:02.880]  Here is my logic.
[03:02.880 --> 03:10.520]  I put these at 1am and I didn't want to set the smoke alarm off again, especially at 1am.
[03:10.700 --> 03:13.940]  So I thought these are probably like 60% heated,
[03:14.120 --> 03:17.200]  could cook them on a low setting and I'll be totally fine.
[03:17.200 --> 03:18.560]  Are they the ones you did in the closet?
[03:19.240 --> 03:19.920]  Yes, they were.
[03:19.980 --> 03:22.680]  The closet dogs were a continuation of the desk.
[03:22.700 --> 03:23.940]  They were twice cooked.
[03:24.540 --> 03:25.980]  They were double heated dogs.
[03:27.520 --> 03:29.260]  Actually, triple cooked two dogs.
[03:29.740 --> 03:32.580]  Yeah, because they would have been, as you said, made before.
[03:32.580 --> 03:35.020]  They came to Andrew Cooked, Gavin.
[03:35.260 --> 03:35.280]  Yes.
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.440]  He's just reheating them.
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.640]  I mean, I have them in my fridge right now.
[03:38.700 --> 03:40.520]  You can see... are these expired?
[03:41.960 --> 03:44.040]  He's got a fridge right there, I keep forgetting.
[03:47.120 --> 03:48.240]  Should I see?
[03:48.340 --> 03:49.480]  How long do hot dogs last?
[03:49.520 --> 03:49.980]  Am I good?
[03:50.100 --> 03:50.940]  Because I've been scared.
[03:51.360 --> 03:52.760]  I think they last for a very long time.
[03:52.880 --> 03:53.740]  Are you sure about that?
[03:54.000 --> 03:54.140]  No.
[03:54.400 --> 03:55.520]  A few months, probably.
[03:55.880 --> 03:57.900]  There's no way these last a few months.
[03:58.060 --> 03:58.620]  I opened the bag.
[03:59.260 --> 04:00.240]  A couple of months?
[04:00.940 --> 04:01.520]  Like cooked?
[04:01.760 --> 04:02.140]  Yeah, like...
[04:02.140 --> 04:03.860]  There's gotta... I mean, there's gotta be a...
[04:03.860 --> 04:04.240]  There's gotta be a...
[04:04.240 --> 04:07.560]  I mean, once you break the seal, it might be like a couple of weeks or something.
[04:07.820 --> 04:08.700]  At least a couple of weeks.
[04:08.940 --> 04:09.800]  The seal is broken.
[04:09.960 --> 04:10.260]  How long?
[04:10.380 --> 04:11.000]  Oh, is this it?
[04:11.220 --> 04:12.540]  There should be a Best Buy date.
[04:12.840 --> 04:13.160]  There is.
[04:13.200 --> 04:13.780]  I'm trying to read it.
[04:13.780 --> 04:14.240]  Or a Sell Buy.
[04:15.460 --> 04:16.100]  December 29th.
[04:16.300 --> 04:17.100]  Yeah, a couple months.
[04:17.280 --> 04:17.660]  Yeah, okay.
[04:17.680 --> 04:17.920]  I'm fine.
[04:18.060 --> 04:19.320]  By the way, I don't like...
[04:19.320 --> 04:21.260]  Can I just bitch about something real fast?
[04:21.360 --> 04:22.200]  I don't like...
[04:22.200 --> 04:26.020]  When you go to a grocery store, and I don't know if it's the same in England or in Canada,
[04:26.420 --> 04:28.500]  so correct me if it's different in your other countries,
[04:28.500 --> 04:31.020]  but Gavin, you live in America, so you should recognize this as well.
[04:31.280 --> 04:33.780]  I don't like that when you go to a grocery store,
[04:34.180 --> 04:37.820]  your perishable goods notify you in one of two ways.
[04:38.160 --> 04:40.780]  They say, Best Buy, which makes sense.
[04:41.260 --> 04:44.380]  This hot dog, it's best if you eat it by November 12th.
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.020]  After November 13th, you could do it, but you're on your own time.
[04:49.360 --> 04:50.320]  We've warned you.
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.880]  You're taking your life into your own hands.
[04:53.160 --> 04:57.180]  Or the infinitely less useful Sell Buy date.
[04:57.180 --> 05:00.740]  I don't give a shit when the grocery store needs to sell it by.
[05:00.860 --> 05:02.180]  I want to know when it's safe to eat by.
[05:02.340 --> 05:04.860]  I got to do some kind of weird math at the end of it,
[05:04.900 --> 05:07.580]  when it's like, well, the grocery store said I have to sell it by tomorrow.
[05:07.760 --> 05:08.640]  So how much longer?
[05:08.880 --> 05:11.100]  Like, it's November 11th.
[05:11.160 --> 05:12.640]  The Sell Buy date is November 10th.
[05:12.780 --> 05:13.720]  Is it still good?
[05:14.400 --> 05:16.800]  What's my grace period from when I buy it to when I eat it?
[05:16.940 --> 05:17.860]  They don't tell you.
[05:18.080 --> 05:18.580]  It's bullshit.
[05:18.900 --> 05:20.260]  The Sell Buy is like the minimum time.
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.880]  Like, stuff will start going iffy after that.
[05:21.880 --> 05:23.580]  But if they don't give you a maximum time...
[05:23.580 --> 05:25.160]  It could be one day. It could be four days.
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.360]  That's not helpful.
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.460]  The Sell Buy is just like, get it off the shelves legally by this day,
[05:30.520 --> 05:31.400]  and you can't get in trouble.
[05:31.600 --> 05:32.820]  Yeah, that's bullshit.
[05:32.980 --> 05:35.540]  That puts all the onus on you, right?
[05:35.800 --> 05:40.000]  And it's putting... it's fucking... it's bullshit, crass commercialism, right?
[05:40.200 --> 05:41.360]  This is what corporations do.
[05:41.500 --> 05:42.960]  They're protecting themselves.
[05:43.200 --> 05:43.740]  Yeah, they are.
[05:43.740 --> 05:45.120]  They're protecting, like, no litigation,
[05:45.340 --> 05:48.660]  because we said it had to be sold by this date, and we sold it by this date.
[05:48.780 --> 05:50.320]  But they're not helping out the consumer.
[05:50.540 --> 05:53.960]  The consumer wants to know, how long is it safe to fucking eat the thing?
[05:53.960 --> 05:56.300]  It helps with the rotation of the products.
[05:56.420 --> 05:58.640]  It helps with when... when do you reduce it?
[05:58.660 --> 06:00.360]  I don't give a fuck about their rotation.
[06:00.480 --> 06:02.120]  Who gives a shit? That's their problem.
[06:02.380 --> 06:04.200]  Develop your own internal system to handle it.
[06:04.200 --> 06:05.740]  I am with Geoff all the way.
[06:06.040 --> 06:06.980]  This is bullshit.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.100]  It's bullshit.
[06:08.580 --> 06:12.340]  It's... and if you are, as a consumer in the world, Gavin,
[06:12.520 --> 06:15.000]  you should be as outraged as Andrew and I are.
[06:15.000 --> 06:18.200]  Well, I'm saying, the people who work in the store, which used to be me,
[06:18.520 --> 06:20.460]  we don't have special access to these products.
[06:20.540 --> 06:21.880]  We gotta pick them up and look at them too.
[06:22.160 --> 06:22.980]  I'm not mad at you.
[06:23.400 --> 06:24.520]  I'm mad at the system.
[06:24.700 --> 06:26.980]  If they're Sellbuy today, we gotta get them off the shelves, man.
[06:27.340 --> 06:29.540]  I'm not attacking the day-to-day worker of the store.
[06:29.660 --> 06:32.640]  I'm attacking the corporations in the system in which they've created.
[06:32.780 --> 06:35.300]  That's like saying, get these fricking barcodes off these.
[06:35.380 --> 06:36.320]  I don't need the barcode.
[06:36.580 --> 06:38.340]  No, it's not. It's not saying it at all.
[06:38.580 --> 06:43.120]  It's just like Sellbuy is only good to protect the store, the grocery store.
[06:43.260 --> 06:45.460]  It doesn't help the consumer in any way whatsoever.
[06:45.460 --> 06:47.460]  How does the barcode help the consumer?
[06:47.820 --> 06:49.800]  I can scan it myself at the till.
[06:49.880 --> 06:50.820]  What do you want from me?
[06:51.260 --> 06:52.240]  I can just... it's easy.
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.300]  I know how barcodes work.
[06:53.440 --> 06:56.180]  That's just you working, like taking the workload off the supermarket.
[06:56.600 --> 06:56.880]  Yeah.
[06:57.340 --> 06:59.780]  Well, I'm just... I don't know why you're defending this corporation.
[07:00.060 --> 07:00.880]  This is nonsense.
[07:01.360 --> 07:02.760]  Gavin's very big business.
[07:03.060 --> 07:04.600]  I don't understand what you're doing.
[07:04.980 --> 07:08.040]  I'm saying, yeah, put a Best Buy, a Best Before on there also.
[07:08.400 --> 07:11.980]  But to be honest, if you're looking at something that's past its Sellbuy,
[07:12.060 --> 07:13.880]  you should probably be eating it then.
[07:14.180 --> 07:15.940]  That's why it has a Sellbuy.
[07:16.300 --> 07:20.340]  Nah, Sellbuy is different from Best Buy because I've talked to people at the grocery store before.
[07:20.340 --> 07:26.220]  And I've been like, it says, it says, I, I, this is, I gotta, you gotta sell this by Wednesday.
[07:26.740 --> 07:28.340]  How long is it good after that?
[07:28.380 --> 07:30.660]  And the guy's like, I don't know, a couple days or something.
[07:30.720 --> 07:31.360]  They don't know.
[07:31.580 --> 07:32.180]  It's useless.
[07:32.280 --> 07:33.080]  There's no help there.
[07:33.460 --> 07:34.120]  It only helps...
[07:34.600 --> 07:41.740]  Because a head of lettuce doesn't overnight go from a nice green delicious sandwich filler
[07:41.740 --> 07:43.180]  to a bunch of brown goo.
[07:43.460 --> 07:46.640]  It's, it depends on the conditions that it's kept in.
[07:46.720 --> 07:50.080]  You have been indoctrinated.
[07:50.500 --> 07:53.400]  Because you worked at Waitrose when you were a kid.
[07:53.660 --> 07:56.100]  You've got, you, they have gotten to you.
[07:56.380 --> 07:57.740]  Dude, we had high standards at Waitrose.
[07:58.520 --> 08:03.260]  If you were caught, if you were caught with something in your section that was like a day
[08:03.260 --> 08:06.300]  past its Sellbuy, you'd get a bollockin'.
[08:06.300 --> 08:08.100]  You'd get an absolute rollickin'.
[08:08.100 --> 08:10.140]  Based on what Gavin said, you know what they should do, Geoff?
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.640]  You know what they should add on top of this?
[08:11.700 --> 08:14.740]  It's like, once again, I think our point is they're just not doing enough work here.
[08:14.980 --> 08:18.260]  They should have ratings of the storage of the store.
[08:18.620 --> 08:19.580]  I want store rating.
[08:19.580 --> 08:20.740]  I want an understanding.
[08:20.900 --> 08:24.020]  I want a system where I can tell how good their storing of the product is.
[08:24.320 --> 08:27.000]  So I can then make a better evaluation of, okay,
[08:27.440 --> 08:28.460]  sold by is past.
[08:28.780 --> 08:29.980]  Am I safe eating this?
[08:30.100 --> 08:30.820]  Is this good?
[08:30.880 --> 08:31.840]  I want more information.
[08:32.220 --> 08:32.980]  And here's the deal.
[08:33.120 --> 08:33.480]  Here's the deal.
[08:33.560 --> 08:34.840]  I totally agree with you, Andrew.
[08:34.900 --> 08:37.700]  And I think independent of this, that needs to exist.
[08:38.100 --> 08:42.620]  But here's a great example of Best Buy technology fucking exists.
[08:43.040 --> 08:43.360]  All right?
[08:43.420 --> 08:45.260]  They don't have to invent anything to come up with.
[08:45.420 --> 08:46.340]  They understand.
[08:46.600 --> 08:49.060]  Half the products in the stores have Best Buy technology.
[08:49.060 --> 08:51.460]  Which means they know how to calculate that.
[08:51.780 --> 08:54.820]  All I'm saying is, if you're going to put a fucking sell by date on it,
[08:54.900 --> 08:59.320]  put the best buy as well, because you already are doing the calculation for other products.
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.700]  And you know how to do it.
[09:00.820 --> 09:03.680]  You're not going to have to invent the whole arm of new technology to do it.
[09:03.860 --> 09:07.240]  Just give us all the information or don't give us the sell by date.
[09:07.380 --> 09:09.280]  Because I don't give a fuck when you have to sell a buy.
[09:09.420 --> 09:11.400]  I just want to know when I have to eat it by.
[09:11.680 --> 09:12.360]  That's just reasonable.
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.280]  But don't you ever have it where even the best buy is way off?
[09:16.280 --> 09:18.720]  Like your milk goes minging before it or...
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.420]  There are anomalies in all circumstances.
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.360]  Yes, it happens on occasion.
[09:25.720 --> 09:26.840]  Your milk will go bad early.
[09:28.020 --> 09:30.640]  But it has to be the exception to the rule.
[09:30.920 --> 09:32.320]  The rule is the best buy date.
[09:32.600 --> 09:34.200]  Right, but you've sold things.
[09:34.700 --> 09:37.600]  What if your shirt went bad after...
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.420]  I can't even be bothered.
[09:38.520 --> 09:39.420]  I'm not going to go down that.
[09:39.440 --> 09:40.480]  No, that's terrible.
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.080]  As the consumers, Gavin, we don't need to be reasonable.
[09:45.080 --> 09:46.400]  That's not our job.
[09:46.460 --> 09:48.560]  Our job is to articulate where we're being failed.
[09:48.800 --> 09:49.880]  Geoff did a great job.
[09:50.140 --> 09:50.820]  Thank you very much.
[09:50.880 --> 09:51.380]  I appreciate that.
[09:51.540 --> 09:53.440]  That was not a rant I intended to go on.
[09:53.580 --> 09:55.180]  No, I appreciate it.
[09:55.300 --> 09:58.740]  It just was birthed out of you looking for your hot dog.
[09:58.920 --> 10:01.860]  I have my own rant as well about another industry.
[10:02.420 --> 10:04.560]  I had never looked into this.
[10:05.020 --> 10:09.240]  This is maybe the biggest fucking scam of any industry I've ever seen.
[10:09.600 --> 10:10.900]  Nobody's talking about this.
[10:11.100 --> 10:13.580]  I don't understand why this isn't being discussed everywhere.
[10:13.580 --> 10:14.740]  Bed sheets.
[10:15.160 --> 10:16.240]  Buying new bed sheets.
[10:16.660 --> 10:19.160]  Fucking the biggest gimmick of all time.
[10:19.780 --> 10:20.400]  What's happening?
[10:20.940 --> 10:21.960]  It is so complicated.
[10:22.480 --> 10:23.540]  Why is it so complicated?
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.880]  Why do I need to order six different things just to get all the bed stuff?
[10:28.320 --> 10:29.440]  It makes no sense.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.960]  I've noticed that about here.
[10:31.120 --> 10:33.240]  There's like, you get the mattress sheet.
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.280]  You get like a flat sheet, which goes between that.
[10:36.820 --> 10:40.080]  And for some reason, nobody here has like duvet covers.
[10:40.080 --> 10:43.920]  They all have comforters, which you just don't put a sheet on.
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.100]  I just put a photo in.
[10:45.340 --> 10:47.300]  What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?
[10:47.380 --> 10:48.140]  Do I need all of it?
[10:48.200 --> 10:49.080]  Do I need one of it?
[10:49.560 --> 10:50.940]  You've got king duvet set.
[10:51.020 --> 10:52.160]  You've got king bedding set.
[10:52.320 --> 10:53.060]  King comforter.
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.760]  King comforter set.
[10:55.420 --> 10:57.460]  What's the difference between a duvet and a comforter?
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.660]  Okay, so you just don't understand how beds work.
[11:00.820 --> 11:02.080]  It's super complicated.
[11:02.360 --> 11:04.480]  It's so much more complicated than it needs to be.
[11:04.780 --> 11:06.240]  So Gavin, do you want to do it?
[11:06.480 --> 11:06.940]  Or do you want me?
[11:07.300 --> 11:07.560]  You got it.
[11:07.560 --> 11:15.040]  As far as I'm aware, a duvet is sort of the fruffering thing that you put a sheet over,
[11:15.140 --> 11:15.440]  right?
[11:15.620 --> 11:18.200]  A comforter, I've never grown up with that.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.360]  I don't know what the point of that is.
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.500]  That seems to be something that you don't put a sheet on that goes on the bed.
[11:23.920 --> 11:25.060]  Andrew, I'm going to explain this for you.
[11:25.100 --> 11:27.220]  And what is the difference between a comforter and a set?
[11:27.400 --> 11:28.240]  Like what is the set?
[11:28.520 --> 11:29.320]  So hold on.
[11:29.380 --> 11:30.200]  So I'm going to explain it to you.
[11:30.240 --> 11:31.240]  All right, I'm going to go down the list.
[11:31.960 --> 11:35.540]  Andrew has presented us a list that says king duvet set.
[11:35.540 --> 11:39.020]  A king duvet is like the white blanket.
[11:39.300 --> 11:39.460]  Yes.
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.700]  Like the puffy blanket that you have like at hotels and stuff that goes on top of your bed.
[11:43.760 --> 11:51.000]  A duvet cover is when you buy like a big fitted, typically with a zipper,
[11:52.800 --> 11:54.580]  cover for that that you put over.
[11:54.740 --> 11:57.520]  It's made, you know, it looks like a sheet, but it's all encased.
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.080]  And that way, if you get sick of having a blue blanket on your bed,
[12:02.160 --> 12:04.620]  you take that duvet cover off and you replace it with a gray one.
[12:04.620 --> 12:07.260]  And you've got a whole new set without having to buy another $200
[12:08.280 --> 12:10.200]  main blanket for your bed.
[12:10.780 --> 12:12.960]  The next one is king bedding set.
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.440]  Bedding set is going to be, in most situations, it's going to be your fitted sheet.
[12:17.820 --> 12:20.780]  It's going to be your unfitted sheet, right?
[12:20.820 --> 12:22.720]  Which goes between the fitted sheet and the blanket.
[12:22.880 --> 12:24.520]  And then it's going to be two pillowcases.
[12:25.100 --> 12:25.780]  That's your bedding set.
[12:26.600 --> 12:26.860]  Okay.
[12:27.280 --> 12:29.740]  A king comforter is just a fucking blanket.
[12:29.880 --> 12:30.740]  It's got a print on it.
[12:30.780 --> 12:33.960]  It's got like paisley or like, I don't know.
[12:33.960 --> 12:38.200]  It's gingham or some design.
[12:38.560 --> 12:40.700]  And you buy it and you're set with that forever.
[12:40.840 --> 12:42.300]  It looks like the way it's going to look forever.
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.360]  So you bought it and maybe it's nice, but that's what it's going to look like always.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.220]  But do you put that against your skin?
[12:49.160 --> 12:50.360]  No, you put it on top.
[12:50.720 --> 12:53.700]  That goes on top between your fitted sheet and your unfitted sheet.
[12:54.040 --> 12:55.740]  It goes fitted sheet, right?
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.240]  Then unfitted sheet, then duvet or comforter.
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.540]  Then you lift up your duvet or comforter and your unfitted sheet,
[13:05.640 --> 13:07.300]  and then you slide in between those.
[13:07.640 --> 13:10.880]  So what's that weird thing that people do where they have the duvet,
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.560]  but then they have something on top of it that's just below the knees?
[13:14.980 --> 13:16.020]  Oh, that's like an extra blanket.
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.380]  But what is the set?
[13:17.580 --> 13:19.340]  Those things, Gavin, I know what you're talking about.
[13:19.400 --> 13:20.100]  I know what you're talking about.
[13:20.260 --> 13:23.180]  They're like oddly shaped and weird and long and they look useless.
[13:23.640 --> 13:26.820]  Yeah, that's purely ornamental.
[13:26.980 --> 13:28.800]  It is decorative shite.
[13:28.800 --> 13:33.000]  All anyone needs is a fitted mattress sheet
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.660]  that sort of hooks under the bottom of the mattress corners
[13:35.660 --> 13:37.580]  and a duvet with a cover on it.
[13:37.680 --> 13:39.020]  That's all anyone needs to sleep.
[13:39.140 --> 13:40.680]  You want a sheet between the du-
[13:40.680 --> 13:40.740]  No!
[13:40.820 --> 13:41.760]  Yeah, you do.
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.800]  No, you don't, because then you can't-
[13:43.800 --> 13:44.940]  your legs get all trapped.
[13:45.100 --> 13:46.920]  Do you know why? Because you sweat.
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.560]  And dude, think of it this way.
[13:48.800 --> 13:51.000]  You sweat in your sleep sometimes.
[13:51.320 --> 13:52.920]  Your skin chafes off.
[13:53.280 --> 13:53.660]  What?
[13:53.660 --> 13:58.920]  You release gross shit in your sleep from your body.
[13:59.100 --> 13:59.120]  Yeah?
[13:59.320 --> 14:00.480]  That's why you change your sheets.
[14:01.080 --> 14:02.780]  And you change-
[14:02.780 --> 14:05.260]  but if you're sleeping directly under your comforter,
[14:05.640 --> 14:07.320]  then you gotta wash your comforter all the time.
[14:07.540 --> 14:08.980]  That's why you need the unfitted sheet.
[14:09.060 --> 14:11.100]  Take the comforter and throw it out the window.
[14:11.240 --> 14:12.080]  No one needs one of them.
[14:12.100 --> 14:12.600]  I totally agree.
[14:12.940 --> 14:13.440]  I totally agree.
[14:13.540 --> 14:16.000]  And by the way, by the way, a sheet and a duvet,
[14:16.220 --> 14:17.140]  you change the sheet-
[14:17.140 --> 14:19.140]  Duvet cover is a pain in the ass to take off.
[14:19.340 --> 14:22.380]  It is, but at least you can clean it as a year and then.
[14:22.380 --> 14:26.460]  It's way easier just to slop a sheet down in between the duvet cover.
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.220]  Yeah, you know, look, look, this is my point.
[14:29.320 --> 14:31.040]  I can't go down this road with you, man.
[14:31.080 --> 14:31.700]  It's my point.
[14:31.780 --> 14:35.460]  When you change your sweaty black sheet that goes between,
[14:35.560 --> 14:37.940]  apparently, between you and the duvet,
[14:38.440 --> 14:40.980]  you gotta change the duvet cover at the same time.
[14:41.260 --> 14:42.040]  No, you're not.
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.180]  You wash the duvet cover.
[14:43.580 --> 14:48.520]  You wash your fitted sheet and your other sheet and your pillowcases once a week.
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.840]  And then you wash the duvet cover whenever the dog
[14:51.840 --> 14:53.380]  has a leaky anus.
[14:53.880 --> 14:54.980]  Or you spill a soda.
[14:55.600 --> 14:58.920]  Right, but it all comes, as Andrew has stated here, it comes as a set.
[14:59.020 --> 15:01.440]  So you're not going to take off your nice blue sheet
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.400]  and then leave on your big Christmas duvet when it's like the next year.
[15:07.040 --> 15:07.280]  What?
[15:07.420 --> 15:08.220]  What are you saying?
[15:08.600 --> 15:10.180]  Okay, this is my problem.
[15:10.360 --> 15:11.740]  We're getting, we're straying from the,
[15:11.800 --> 15:14.540]  I feel like I already made my point that this is fucking nonsense
[15:14.540 --> 15:15.780]  and it's way too complicated.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.520]  It all makes sense and it's not complicated.
[15:17.520 --> 15:18.400]  I just want-
[15:18.400 --> 15:19.180]  No, it doesn't.
[15:19.320 --> 15:21.660]  I just want-
[15:21.660 --> 15:24.720]  Is your comforter and some pillowcases that look like the comforter.
[15:24.920 --> 15:26.040]  Don't need a comforter.
[15:26.080 --> 15:26.540]  That's great.
[15:26.680 --> 15:26.940]  You don't need a comforter.
[15:27.120 --> 15:28.060]  Go with a duvet.
[15:28.420 --> 15:28.820]  You don't need a comforter.
[15:28.820 --> 15:30.160]  I want to buy, this is all I want.
[15:30.300 --> 15:32.180]  I want to just put it in a thing.
[15:32.580 --> 15:34.060]  I just want all the sheets I need.
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.200]  Don't, I don't want to buy six different fucking bundles to have a full bed.
[15:38.200 --> 15:39.020]  You don't need to.
[15:39.380 --> 15:40.240]  I clearly do.
[15:40.380 --> 15:41.200]  There's four options.
[15:41.780 --> 15:44.760]  You're going to have more sheets than duvet covers.
[15:44.880 --> 15:47.900]  Like you're looking at sheets and a blanket, essentially.
[15:48.200 --> 15:51.160]  The blanket you buy once, you're going to have like multiple sheets.
[15:51.160 --> 15:55.920]  But if I want a cool, if I want a cool themed bedding, I need to buy all of it.
[15:56.020 --> 15:57.720]  And I can't just buy it in one thing.
[15:57.940 --> 15:59.440]  I have to buy four different pieces.
[15:59.820 --> 16:01.180]  You don't need the comforter.
[16:01.240 --> 16:02.020]  You don't need the comforter.
[16:02.140 --> 16:03.880]  Get the bedding set, right?
[16:04.060 --> 16:07.700]  But I can't, okay, but I have a duvet and I need a cover for it, right?
[16:07.760 --> 16:09.040]  So I can't just get the duvet.
[16:09.080 --> 16:11.860]  The king duvet set would clearly come with the duvet cover.
[16:12.040 --> 16:14.980]  And so if I don't have the cover, then it's like, I'm just have a blanket.
[16:15.040 --> 16:16.400]  It's not part of the cool set.
[16:16.600 --> 16:19.000]  What do you mean you're not going to get in every single one of those options?
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.940]  Like the bedding set and the duvet set will come with a duvet cover.
[16:23.060 --> 16:23.720]  Oh, really?
[16:23.860 --> 16:24.740]  Oh, okay.
[16:24.940 --> 16:26.220]  Yeah, that's more reasonable.
[16:26.600 --> 16:28.280]  You want the king bedding set.
[16:28.660 --> 16:28.800]  Okay.
[16:29.240 --> 16:33.080]  See, in my head, this is what was so confusing about this, because I have no idea how beds work.
[16:33.460 --> 16:35.520]  I thought it would be like buying a car.
[16:35.600 --> 16:35.920]  Why would you?
[16:36.020 --> 16:37.280]  You spend a third of your life in them.
[16:37.340 --> 16:38.600]  Why would you understand how they work?
[16:38.860 --> 16:40.740]  I just appreciate them for what they are.
[16:40.960 --> 16:41.600]  I enjoy it.
[16:41.660 --> 16:43.880]  It's comfy, but I didn't know what to buy.
[16:43.960 --> 16:45.520]  Like, do I buy all of those things?
[16:45.640 --> 16:46.740]  Do I need all those things?
[16:46.740 --> 16:50.840]  I definitely don't need a comforter and a comforter set, but do I just need the comforter
[16:50.840 --> 16:51.200]  set?
[16:51.340 --> 16:53.480]  Is the comforter set different than the bedding set?
[16:53.980 --> 16:55.340]  It's just very complicated.
[16:55.540 --> 16:55.860]  It's not.
[16:55.980 --> 16:56.700]  I understand.
[16:57.220 --> 17:01.100]  I can understand how there would be a barrier to entry.
[17:02.800 --> 17:08.920]  But once you crack the code, Andrew, it's pretty fucking simple to keep up.
[17:08.960 --> 17:11.080]  When I googled, why is this so confusing?
[17:11.260 --> 17:12.560]  I got articles left and right.
[17:12.660 --> 17:14.580]  19 steps you need before buying bedding.
[17:14.580 --> 17:17.180]  There shouldn't be 19 steps to bedding ever.
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.140]  What are you doing?
[17:18.340 --> 17:20.000]  This whole system is a disaster.
[17:20.360 --> 17:21.800]  Yeah, and then you're not even...
[17:21.800 --> 17:22.080]  That's all SEO shit.
[17:22.200 --> 17:22.940]  You can't count that.
[17:22.940 --> 17:25.100]  You're not even getting to throw pillows and stuff.
[17:25.480 --> 17:25.660]  Ugh.
[17:25.820 --> 17:27.020]  So what do you have now?
[17:27.100 --> 17:28.860]  Did you just get a new king bed or something?
[17:29.100 --> 17:30.260]  No, I've had a bed for a while.
[17:30.380 --> 17:33.060]  I ripped the sheet while I was injured right down the middle.
[17:33.180 --> 17:34.160]  Totally destroyed.
[17:34.360 --> 17:35.520]  So I'm looking into new bedding.
[17:35.720 --> 17:36.640]  I love my bedding.
[17:36.680 --> 17:37.660]  I want something cool.
[17:38.260 --> 17:39.320]  What do you have now?
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.880]  Do you have just the mattress sheet and the duvet sheet?
[17:43.880 --> 17:45.480]  This is what I have, okay?
[17:45.760 --> 17:46.740]  I don't speak bed.
[17:46.980 --> 17:48.520]  So you're just gonna have to bear with me here.
[17:48.720 --> 17:49.680]  I got the bed.
[17:49.880 --> 17:52.580]  I got a mattress support above the bed.
[17:52.720 --> 17:55.340]  Then I have a cover that covers all of that.
[17:55.560 --> 17:57.220]  Then I got a sheet above that.
[17:57.560 --> 17:58.720]  Then I got my duvet.
[17:59.060 --> 18:00.280]  No cover, just a plain duvet.
[18:00.280 --> 18:02.020]  So you're another middle sheeter.
[18:02.640 --> 18:03.360]  I guess I'm middle sheeter.
[18:03.360 --> 18:03.920]  I'm blown away by this.
[18:04.140 --> 18:05.000]  Most people are, Gav.
[18:05.000 --> 18:05.920]  I don't... I keep it loose.
[18:05.920 --> 18:06.620]  It's too hot.
[18:06.860 --> 18:07.300]  It's too hot.
[18:07.440 --> 18:09.040]  You never tuck it in.
[18:09.180 --> 18:10.220]  You don't want to feel trapped.
[18:10.320 --> 18:10.700]  I'm with you.
[18:10.800 --> 18:12.300]  You trap your legs if you tuck it in.
[18:12.300 --> 18:15.800]  I like to feel trapped, but I guess you don't.
[18:15.960 --> 18:18.980]  If you've got the sheet on the duvet, it's a two-in-one.
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.280]  It is your middle sheet.
[18:20.500 --> 18:25.920]  No, because it's way more of a hassle to replace a duvet cover than it is just to wash that
[18:25.920 --> 18:26.940]  fucking sheet, buddy.
[18:27.360 --> 18:29.200]  Like, I can't go down that road with you.
[18:29.200 --> 18:30.100]  You're gonna drool on it.
[18:30.360 --> 18:32.340]  You're gonna be, like, touching it with your hands.
[18:32.680 --> 18:34.800]  This is not nearly as often.
[18:35.020 --> 18:36.340]  I do this.
[18:36.520 --> 18:37.960]  I sit at home.
[18:38.060 --> 18:38.840]  I do the laundry.
[18:39.280 --> 18:40.820]  I wash the sheets once a week.
[18:40.820 --> 18:45.980]  I wash the duvet cover whenever the dog, like, drools on it, which is not all the time.
[18:46.320 --> 18:50.980]  Every time, I just rip all the sheets off, and I wash them all, and I put a new set on.
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.220]  A whole lot at once.
[18:52.320 --> 18:53.380]  Why would you do some and not the other?
[18:53.440 --> 18:54.660]  Because then you've got a different rota.
[18:54.840 --> 18:55.120]  You're over-washing it.
[18:55.140 --> 18:56.060]  You're over-washing it.
[18:56.080 --> 18:56.560]  I'm with Gavin.
[18:56.960 --> 18:57.760]  You do them all at once.
[18:58.200 --> 19:00.740]  Gavin's making it to be more complicated.
[19:00.780 --> 19:04.700]  I'm not doing my mattress weekly and my duvet bi-weekly.
[19:05.040 --> 19:08.820]  He's dead fucking on about comforters.
[19:08.960 --> 19:10.380]  Comforters are a scam.
[19:10.380 --> 19:11.600]  You don't need them.
[19:11.700 --> 19:12.620]  They're bullshit.
[19:12.860 --> 19:17.220]  All a comforter does is make you spend more to limit your options.
[19:17.560 --> 19:18.060]  They're doo-doo.
[19:18.180 --> 19:19.320]  You want a duvet and a duvet cover.
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.160]  But you shouldn't be taking your duvet out of your duvet cover very often at all,
[19:23.540 --> 19:25.840]  because that's what your fucking fitted sheets are for.
[19:26.240 --> 19:26.840]  It's a mess.
[19:27.480 --> 19:28.020]  I will say that.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.200]  Something else I learned.
[19:29.360 --> 19:31.440]  We are 20 minutes into talking about beds.
[19:31.540 --> 19:32.620]  Yeah, I'm not done yet either.
[19:33.000 --> 19:33.680]  This is a very...
[19:34.520 --> 19:36.240]  How many pillows do you guys use?
[19:36.700 --> 19:37.080]  One.
[19:37.720 --> 19:37.960]  Two.
[19:38.140 --> 19:38.780]  Are you serious?
[19:39.020 --> 19:40.080]  I use two.
[19:40.080 --> 19:42.800]  I used to be a double pillow kind of guy.
[19:42.920 --> 19:44.660]  I used to like sticking an arm between them.
[19:45.180 --> 19:50.520]  Now I just have a very dense, very supportive single pillow.
[19:50.780 --> 19:51.260]  Oh, okay.
[19:51.720 --> 19:52.240]  I have...
[19:52.860 --> 19:54.940]  Okay, I have eight pillows on my bed.
[19:55.240 --> 19:55.920]  Shut up.
[19:56.240 --> 20:00.280]  I mean, I have eight pillows on my bed, but you take most of them off.
[20:00.420 --> 20:01.160]  I have eight pillows.
[20:01.580 --> 20:01.640]  Why?
[20:02.360 --> 20:03.320]  Don't get me started.
[20:04.820 --> 20:05.600]  It's decorative.
[20:06.300 --> 20:07.260]  Get them out of there.
[20:07.560 --> 20:08.440]  No, they're all great.
[20:08.500 --> 20:09.140]  I have eight pillows.
[20:09.140 --> 20:10.740]  I have two of them are like...
[20:10.740 --> 20:12.860]  They're not body pillows, but they're like long pillows.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.120]  They're like half body pillows.
[20:14.300 --> 20:14.880]  They're thick.
[20:15.100 --> 20:15.940]  So I have two of those.
[20:16.500 --> 20:18.300]  And then I have six standard pillows.
[20:18.980 --> 20:21.060]  How many pillows do you think I use when I go to sleep?
[20:21.500 --> 20:21.780]  One.
[20:22.140 --> 20:22.660]  That's your guess.
[20:22.700 --> 20:22.920]  One.
[20:23.020 --> 20:23.880]  Geoff, do you want to make a guess?
[20:24.300 --> 20:25.180]  I don't know, man.
[20:25.220 --> 20:26.240]  I would say zero.
[20:26.800 --> 20:27.180]  I don't know.
[20:27.420 --> 20:28.220]  Why would I use zero pillows?
[20:28.440 --> 20:31.040]  I don't know, because it's got to be the most ludicrous answer.
[20:31.680 --> 20:33.960]  I use eight pillows.
[20:34.720 --> 20:35.360]  I use all of them.
[20:35.360 --> 20:35.720]  You don't.
[20:36.040 --> 20:36.800]  You don't.
[20:37.280 --> 20:38.040]  Yes, I do.
[20:38.040 --> 20:39.560]  I use all of them, and I don't even think about it.
[20:39.560 --> 20:41.180]  Why even have a bed at that point?
[20:41.200 --> 20:42.720]  Just sleep in a pillow fort.
[20:43.080 --> 20:43.840]  What do I do?
[20:44.460 --> 20:45.160]  I don't know.
[20:45.260 --> 20:48.300]  It's never struck me as weird to constantly use one pillow.
[20:48.500 --> 20:48.760]  Go ahead.
[20:48.960 --> 20:50.060]  Let me guess where you put them.
[20:50.280 --> 20:50.360]  Right.
[20:50.580 --> 20:50.960]  Sure, go ahead.
[20:51.020 --> 20:52.540]  You have two under your head.
[20:52.700 --> 20:53.820]  You're hugging one.
[20:54.240 --> 20:54.360]  Nope.
[20:54.360 --> 20:56.760]  You're probably a weirdo who has one between your knees.
[20:56.980 --> 20:57.120]  Nope.
[20:57.120 --> 20:57.740]  Because I know people do.
[20:57.840 --> 20:58.920]  Okay, I've got no idea.
[20:59.140 --> 20:59.800]  I stack them.
[21:00.240 --> 21:03.440]  I put the two hard ones at the bottom to build good structural integrity.
[21:03.720 --> 21:05.000]  And then I stack six.
[21:05.520 --> 21:06.660]  And then I fall into it.
[21:06.660 --> 21:07.940]  The bottom of the bed.
[21:08.100 --> 21:09.020]  So we have the bed.
[21:09.180 --> 21:13.020]  And then I put the two body pillow type things first.
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.000]  They're down at the bottom.
[21:14.220 --> 21:15.680]  Wait, you say bottom.
[21:15.720 --> 21:16.620]  You mean where your feet?
[21:16.620 --> 21:19.240]  You make a second bed of pillows?
[21:19.740 --> 21:20.220]  No, okay.
[21:20.280 --> 21:21.540]  So I put the two at my head.
[21:21.720 --> 21:23.060]  The two body pillows at my head.
[21:23.520 --> 21:25.320]  And they're like the base of the Jenga tower.
[21:25.600 --> 21:27.340]  And then I just stack six up.
[21:27.820 --> 21:28.380]  That's how I lay them.
[21:28.380 --> 21:30.340]  So you have eight pillows tall?
[21:30.700 --> 21:31.700]  Yeah, it's eight pillows tall.
[21:31.720 --> 21:33.880]  No, you see, but you sleep bow upright.
[21:34.040 --> 21:35.360]  What do you mean eight pillows tall?
[21:35.580 --> 21:36.080]  No, I don't.
[21:36.080 --> 21:38.520]  What I do, I make like a comfort mountain.
[21:38.680 --> 21:40.220]  And then I put my shoulder into it.
[21:40.260 --> 21:40.620]  And I'm out.
[21:40.900 --> 21:41.680]  I just go to sleep.
[21:41.800 --> 21:42.380]  It's fantastic.
[21:42.880 --> 21:44.040]  But you're sleeping.
[21:44.300 --> 21:46.160]  You're sitting up mostly at this point.
[21:46.200 --> 21:47.020]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:47.060 --> 21:47.800]  I'm stretched out.
[21:47.880 --> 21:48.540]  I'm laying down.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.580]  But my upper half is definitely on its side.
[21:51.700 --> 21:52.500]  I'm probably...
[21:52.500 --> 21:55.800]  My head is probably, I don't know, three feet from the bed.
[21:55.960 --> 21:57.180]  Two and a half feet from the bed.
[21:57.880 --> 21:58.780]  I'll tell you what's happening.
[21:58.920 --> 22:01.900]  Your heart is just fucking pumping blood straight to a bad ankle.
[22:02.280 --> 22:03.080]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[22:03.200 --> 22:04.240]  That's what's going on.
[22:04.240 --> 22:05.480]  It never occurred to me.
[22:05.580 --> 22:05.900]  It's weird.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.740]  It also never occurred to me to only use one.
[22:07.880 --> 22:08.440]  I have eight.
[22:08.600 --> 22:09.520]  Why wouldn't I use all eight?
[22:09.740 --> 22:10.260]  Pillows are great.
[22:10.340 --> 22:11.400]  Why wouldn't I use all of them?
[22:11.680 --> 22:12.400]  Your spine!
[22:12.560 --> 22:16.620]  Okay, so I'm imagining if I've walked into your bedroom.
[22:16.740 --> 22:17.640]  I've seen you asleep.
[22:18.140 --> 22:19.740]  I'm looking from the top down.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.600]  There's your head and then maybe the headboard.
[22:23.320 --> 22:23.540]  Yeah.
[22:24.300 --> 22:27.420]  Does your head sleep higher than a headboard?
[22:28.760 --> 22:32.220]  I don't think I could sleep with a headboard in my current sleep system.
[22:32.600 --> 22:33.160]  It would be hard.
[22:33.160 --> 22:34.820]  I don't understand.
[22:35.640 --> 22:40.980]  So are you just lent against a wall of pillows or are you at the top of pillow mountain?
[22:41.460 --> 22:42.500]  No, I'm laying on the wall.
[22:42.780 --> 22:50.900]  So my ass is on the bed and then my upper half is just engulfed in this pillow mountain.
[22:51.360 --> 22:56.140]  But where does your head, if from one to eight, where is your head lent against?
[22:56.400 --> 22:58.600]  Oh, probably like, probably like seven.
[22:59.160 --> 23:01.280]  Can you do me a favor?
[23:02.040 --> 23:04.700]  At some point in the future, can you draw this?
[23:05.980 --> 23:08.960]  I'm having a hard time visualizing it.
[23:08.960 --> 23:13.100]  I will stack my pillows for how I lay in them and I'll take a photo of my setup.
[23:13.400 --> 23:16.320]  All right, I'm putting it on or I'm going to get it put on Instagram.
[23:16.640 --> 23:17.400]  Just do it now.
[23:17.620 --> 23:18.700]  In your room now.
[23:18.780 --> 23:20.980]  I gotta walk around my foot.
[23:21.420 --> 23:24.140]  He probably wants to show off his new comforter and stuff too.
[23:24.180 --> 23:24.420]  Yeah.
[23:25.060 --> 23:26.040]  Oh my god.
[23:26.180 --> 23:28.180]  I'll wait until I get the new sheets and everything.
[23:28.340 --> 23:28.980]  It'll be a whole thing.
[23:29.320 --> 23:30.980]  But it never occurred to me that that was weird.
[23:30.980 --> 23:33.520]  When you lie down, like if you lie down on your side.
[23:33.740 --> 23:33.960]  Yep.
[23:34.260 --> 23:38.480]  There's a gap between where your shoulder and your head are.
[23:38.720 --> 23:41.400]  Because your shoulders could touch the bed, but your head doesn't.
[23:41.420 --> 23:42.000]  Not how I lie.
[23:42.740 --> 23:47.040]  If any man lays on their side, there's a gap under their head.
[23:47.260 --> 23:47.440]  Right?
[23:47.740 --> 23:47.960]  Right.
[23:48.200 --> 23:50.000]  Put one pillow there.
[23:50.580 --> 23:51.200]  See you later.
[23:51.360 --> 23:51.860]  Jobs are good.
[23:52.120 --> 23:53.680]  No, you need way more than that.
[23:53.760 --> 23:55.540]  I like to feel secure.
[23:55.740 --> 23:56.820]  I want everything solid.
[23:57.160 --> 23:59.500]  When I was younger, I was like maybe a three pillow kid.
[23:59.500 --> 24:03.740]  And I would just put them all against the wall and just lay into the wall as hard as I could.
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.800]  I had a very quick neck.
[24:05.020 --> 24:06.060]  Very quick neck sleep.
[24:06.360 --> 24:07.360]  How is your posture?
[24:07.900 --> 24:08.400]  Oh, it's great.
[24:08.560 --> 24:09.620]  I think my posture is fine.
[24:09.660 --> 24:10.320]  I'm sitting upright.
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.100]  Somehow, the way your head has been in your sleep, that's somehow affected your ankles.
[24:15.340 --> 24:15.500]  I bet.
[24:15.860 --> 24:17.240]  I bet your ankles are out of whack.
[24:18.520 --> 24:18.880]  Totally.
[24:19.600 --> 24:25.800]  Your spine has been tugging on your pelvis, ripping your shins up and bending your ankles.
[24:26.140 --> 24:26.680]  You're getting...
[24:26.680 --> 24:27.620]  Yeah, he's right.
[24:27.860 --> 24:29.480]  You're doing something to yourself here.
[24:30.920 --> 24:32.980]  Nothing, nothing about you is normal.
[24:34.740 --> 24:36.320]  No, I'm very normal.
[24:36.520 --> 24:40.720]  But the pillow thing, once again, I just think it makes sense if you have pillows,
[24:40.880 --> 24:42.680]  use as many as you can while being comfortable.
[24:43.000 --> 24:43.840]  You're too high up.
[24:43.940 --> 24:45.560]  Did you ever get a nosebleed in your sleep?
[24:47.060 --> 24:48.280]  That's too high altitude.
[24:48.780 --> 24:49.180]  It's tough.
[24:49.720 --> 24:50.680]  It's tough up there.
[24:50.840 --> 24:51.360]  No, it's not.
[24:51.640 --> 24:52.060]  Oh, shit.
[24:52.380 --> 24:53.640]  I have great sleeps.
[24:53.820 --> 24:55.040]  I have a fantastic sleep.
[24:55.400 --> 24:55.900]  It's great.
[24:57.140 --> 24:58.560]  What do you dream about?
[24:58.560 --> 25:00.880]  Do you always dream that you're super tall?
[25:01.080 --> 25:01.880]  That was...
[25:03.360 --> 25:04.800]  I've never had a tall dream.
[25:05.040 --> 25:05.880]  I should now.
[25:06.220 --> 25:06.880]  I should have one.
[25:07.000 --> 25:07.760]  I'm very high up.
[25:11.560 --> 25:12.560]  I dreamt a lot.
[25:12.620 --> 25:13.140]  I have a lot.
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.420]  When I was on the pain, the prescription pain pills, I was constantly falling asleep
[25:17.420 --> 25:20.620]  and then waking myself up because I'd be writing somebody a message
[25:20.620 --> 25:24.860]  and then my thumb would hit the keyboard and I'd get excited that I got an alert.
[25:25.360 --> 25:25.980]  Like, oh, an email.
[25:26.580 --> 25:27.460]  Wake myself up.
[25:27.700 --> 25:28.440]  I had a lot of sleep.
[25:28.560 --> 25:31.100]  Oh, I can't handle it today.
[25:31.340 --> 25:33.000]  Anyway, this isn't crying.
[25:33.200 --> 25:33.980]  This isn't even...
[25:34.780 --> 25:35.800]  I have another bed dilemma.
[25:36.360 --> 25:37.180]  We're almost...
[25:37.180 --> 25:38.600]  Fucking please, please.
[25:38.640 --> 25:39.420]  What's your next bed dilemma?
[25:39.840 --> 25:41.520]  So this is a serious issue.
[25:42.240 --> 25:43.900]  It's 12 p.m. at night.
[25:44.060 --> 25:44.580]  It's late.
[25:44.860 --> 25:45.080]  Do you mean?
[25:45.220 --> 25:45.400]  Okay.
[25:45.740 --> 25:46.460]  It's 12 a.m.
[25:46.480 --> 25:46.980]  12 a.m.?
[25:46.980 --> 25:47.560]  12 a.m.
[25:47.580 --> 25:48.160]  You're right.
[25:50.080 --> 25:51.980]  Tell me one of those dilemmas solved.
[25:52.420 --> 25:55.520]  Yeah, one of those late afternoons.
[25:55.920 --> 25:56.580]  12 a.m.
[25:56.840 --> 25:57.400]  It's shifted.
[25:57.400 --> 26:00.980]  In my head, I was gonna say 1159, but that's a weird time.
[26:01.320 --> 26:02.400]  That's why I got tripped up.
[26:02.980 --> 26:04.360]  But the point is, it's late.
[26:04.580 --> 26:05.160]  I'm by myself.
[26:05.520 --> 26:06.640]  I can't walk.
[26:07.020 --> 26:07.700]  Now I'm out.
[26:07.940 --> 26:08.620]  I need pills.
[26:08.860 --> 26:12.680]  I need to take my prescription pain pills or else there's no chance I'm going to sleep.
[26:13.140 --> 26:13.880]  This is what I have.
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.960]  I'm laying in my bed.
[26:16.200 --> 26:17.920]  I look to my left at my end table.
[26:18.440 --> 26:19.560]  This is what I'm dealing with.
[26:19.920 --> 26:20.580]  What do you do?
[26:21.020 --> 26:22.300]  You need to swallow two pills.
[26:23.200 --> 26:24.480]  The cans are empty.
[26:24.960 --> 26:25.940]  You got no water.
[26:25.940 --> 26:27.220]  The cans are empty.
[26:27.660 --> 26:29.980]  These are all the resources you have.
[26:30.200 --> 26:31.180]  There's no help.
[26:31.660 --> 26:32.540]  There's no help.
[26:32.620 --> 26:33.140]  What do you do?
[26:33.520 --> 26:33.960]  All right.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.140]  Well, you dry swallow the pills because you're an adult and it's not hard to do.
[26:38.340 --> 26:39.040]  No, no, no, no.
[26:39.120 --> 26:39.560]  You've never...
[26:40.040 --> 26:41.480]  I've never dry swallowed.
[26:41.640 --> 26:42.680]  That seems very intimidating.
[26:42.680 --> 26:43.380]  Don't dry swallow.
[26:43.560 --> 26:44.360]  He's an idiot.
[26:44.720 --> 26:46.620]  You want to take two pills in your hand.
[26:46.740 --> 26:50.080]  You want to give them a light coating of Pam and they'll slide right down.
[26:53.060 --> 26:53.920]  Well, that was the application.
[26:53.920 --> 26:55.760]  Shove them in a hot dog and eat it.
[26:55.940 --> 26:57.560]  You're hiding a pill from a dog.
[26:59.380 --> 27:02.860]  Also, why are you storing the ketchup upside down?
[27:03.120 --> 27:03.560]  What do you mean?
[27:04.120 --> 27:04.960]  What do you mean?
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.400]  Why am I storing the ketchup upside down?
[27:06.540 --> 27:07.740]  That's the top.
[27:08.060 --> 27:08.620]  What do you mean?
[27:08.820 --> 27:10.420]  No, the top is the cap.
[27:10.820 --> 27:11.480]  No, it's not.
[27:11.800 --> 27:12.520]  Why would it be the cap?
[27:12.600 --> 27:13.000]  That's dangerous.
[27:13.160 --> 27:15.940]  Why would you have the part where it could seep out facing down?
[27:15.960 --> 27:16.700]  No, it doesn't seep out.
[27:16.720 --> 27:17.260]  It's a seal.
[27:17.420 --> 27:19.960]  And it means that when you pick it up, it's ready to go.
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.660]  And the ketchup is at the cap.
[27:23.120 --> 27:23.580]  You've got...
[27:23.580 --> 27:25.620]  Did you not find it weird that the label's upside down?
[27:26.440 --> 27:26.840]  No.
[27:27.080 --> 27:28.900]  No, why would you have the cap down?
[27:30.500 --> 27:34.620]  If I put the cap down, there's a scenario in which it comes out of the cap.
[27:34.680 --> 27:37.500]  If I cap up, there's no way in which it comes out of the cap.
[27:37.660 --> 27:40.140]  Every label is the right way up except for the ketchup.
[27:40.300 --> 27:41.060]  What are you talking about?
[27:41.100 --> 27:41.780]  I don't understand.
[27:41.780 --> 27:42.800]  What are you talking about?
[27:44.000 --> 27:44.740]  He's right.
[27:44.960 --> 27:45.160]  You don't put...
[27:45.580 --> 27:46.300]  No, this...
[27:46.300 --> 27:47.240]  What I'm saying makes sense.
[27:47.240 --> 27:48.840]  That's why the cap is flat, dude.
[27:48.940 --> 27:51.680]  So the cap is flat and it has a seal.
[27:51.920 --> 27:55.340]  That's so you don't have to fucking shake it like a psycho
[27:55.340 --> 27:57.480]  to get the ketchup toward the fucking...
[27:57.480 --> 28:00.840]  If you flip that open and hold it upside down, it won't come out.
[28:00.900 --> 28:04.580]  You've got to squeeze through the little anus, the little sphincter in the cap.
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.140]  I think there's a 1% risk cap down, so I go cap up because there's zero risk there.
[28:09.360 --> 28:12.300]  You don't put a fucking Dr. Pepper face down, that's flat too.
[28:12.580 --> 28:14.820]  That's liquid, that's gravity with a hole.
[28:15.220 --> 28:17.100]  That's the freaking ketchup, Andrew.
[28:17.500 --> 28:22.860]  If there's the risk and you're avoiding that, instead of the risk, which won't leak out,
[28:22.860 --> 28:27.040]  you have to bash and wait for your ketchup to land at the hole.
[28:27.260 --> 28:28.200]  Do you want to get fucking real?
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.780]  Do you want to have a real answer to this?
[28:29.900 --> 28:30.500]  Well, yeah.
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.180]  Cap down, right?
[28:32.280 --> 28:35.000]  You put cap down, there's momentum and gravity,
[28:35.320 --> 28:39.060]  and sometimes you open the cap, you're fucking coated in ketchup.
[28:39.340 --> 28:40.460]  Never happens.
[28:40.600 --> 28:41.580]  That's not real.
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.860]  Literally happened the day I used the fucking ketchup.
[28:45.260 --> 28:46.120]  That's why it's cap-
[28:46.120 --> 28:49.000]  Waffle, did you open it with it already squeezed?
[28:49.240 --> 28:52.000]  Are you squeezing it like you're trying to choke the life out of something
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  as you're popping the cap?
[28:53.060 --> 28:54.420]  No, no, no, I don't know.
[28:54.620 --> 28:55.680]  The air was in there.
[28:55.700 --> 28:56.780]  It's so heavy-handed.
[28:58.160 --> 29:00.960]  He's always biting down too hard through his phones.
[29:01.280 --> 29:02.640]  He's always squeezing his ketchup.
[29:04.340 --> 29:05.640]  Calm down, man.
[29:05.860 --> 29:08.740]  I'm telling you, if you have a bottle of ketchup like that,
[29:08.960 --> 29:13.500]  and you keep it cap down, and you just open the cap, it will spray on you at one point.
[29:13.520 --> 29:13.840]  No, no.
[29:14.080 --> 29:14.800]  It will happen.
[29:15.080 --> 29:15.660]  It will happen.
[29:15.860 --> 29:16.660]  Now, now.
[29:17.040 --> 29:17.180]  It happened to me.
[29:17.780 --> 29:19.040]  I have to ask about the ketchup.
[29:19.860 --> 29:20.660]  Are you doing?
[29:20.800 --> 29:21.880]  Are you doing the Chef Mike?
[29:22.420 --> 29:27.260]  No, I was, uh, I had, uh, I had, like, something that could use ketchup on it.
[29:27.660 --> 29:28.880]  Oh, a desk dog?
[29:29.060 --> 29:30.980]  That was a desk dog, uh, yes.
[29:31.020 --> 29:35.640]  But is there ready to be used in Chef Mike's, uh, whatever he was talking about?
[29:35.860 --> 29:36.940]  Yeah, I still have no clue.
[29:37.260 --> 29:38.260]  I'm sure it was a great tip.
[29:38.660 --> 29:39.720]  So what did you do?
[29:39.920 --> 29:40.760]  Well, what would you do?
[29:40.800 --> 29:41.720]  I guess is the first question.
[29:42.420 --> 29:46.600]  I would dry swallow the fucking pills because I am an adult human being.
[29:46.900 --> 29:48.260]  Okay, well, I had a cup too.
[29:48.260 --> 29:49.800]  It's not really present there.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.820]  I, I just kind of, I asked people, uh, what I should do.
[29:53.080 --> 29:55.400]  It's kind of a different, like, use the Pam, use the ketchup.
[29:55.520 --> 29:58.760]  Some people just said, use your own spit, which seemed crazy to me.
[29:59.000 --> 29:59.840]  That's also doable.
[30:00.200 --> 30:00.640]  I don't know.
[30:00.740 --> 30:01.480]  I, I tried it.
[30:01.500 --> 30:02.520]  I did do it last night.
[30:02.620 --> 30:03.300]  It wasn't pleasant.
[30:03.840 --> 30:06.440]  It was very difficult to generate enough spit.
[30:06.620 --> 30:11.540]  I also, they made fun of me because I started spitting into a cup to try to accumulate the spit.
[30:11.540 --> 30:12.600]  Oh, what is that?
[30:12.740 --> 30:13.080]  Oh.
[30:13.120 --> 30:15.020]  Why, why is that grosser?
[30:15.180 --> 30:15.540]  Oh.
[30:15.620 --> 30:16.700]  I don't think that's grosser.
[30:16.700 --> 30:18.200]  Spit out of your mouth.
[30:18.340 --> 30:20.320]  Once it leaves your mouth, it can't go back in.
[30:20.680 --> 30:25.980]  Any, any liquid that your body produces when stored is disgusting.
[30:26.500 --> 30:26.700]  Yes.
[30:26.760 --> 30:29.440]  Like if you have a cup of sweat or piss.
[30:29.560 --> 30:31.500]  I'm not saving this for fucking Christmas.
[30:32.060 --> 30:33.780]  I'm going to drink it in a minute.
[30:34.200 --> 30:37.040]  Oh, the second it leaves your body, you can't come back.
[30:37.840 --> 30:40.020]  It's not going to drink it.
[30:40.240 --> 30:45.360]  Like, we already drink spit constantly.
[30:45.360 --> 30:46.880]  I don't know why this is a big deal.
[30:47.080 --> 30:49.360]  I don't know why putting it in the cup is a big deal.
[30:49.360 --> 30:50.300]  I don't drink spit.
[30:50.440 --> 30:53.600]  I swallow what is like overproduced in my mouth.
[30:53.680 --> 30:58.760]  I don't like, I don't think, oh, let me just get a nice mouthful going and then drink it down.
[30:59.440 --> 31:01.980]  It's a byproduct of me using my mouth.
[31:02.080 --> 31:03.240]  I'm not like, oh, I'm thirsty.
[31:03.540 --> 31:04.420]  No, but you consume it.
[31:04.420 --> 31:07.820]  You certainly don't spit into a Solo cup for an hour and then fucking drink it.
[31:07.840 --> 31:09.860]  I viewed it as like chewing tobacco.
[31:09.960 --> 31:13.760]  When people said you spit, I was like, well, I certainly can't generate enough in my mouth at
[31:13.760 --> 31:14.200]  one time.
[31:14.300 --> 31:18.320]  So I started trying to spit into one of the cans and that didn't work well.
[31:18.420 --> 31:19.160]  So that was a dead end.
[31:19.220 --> 31:20.380]  Oh, my God.
[31:20.580 --> 31:23.940]  So one of those cans is Dr. Pepperdregs and one is a can of spit.
[31:24.240 --> 31:27.480]  Well, OK, and then I used the bottle because I thought, well, I don't,
[31:27.620 --> 31:29.200]  I'm not just going to spray Pam into my mouth.
[31:29.280 --> 31:30.560]  So I tried to fill it with a cup.
[31:30.920 --> 31:33.080]  Very hard to fill Pam in a cup.
[31:33.100 --> 31:34.560]  Just kind of sticks to the side.
[31:35.000 --> 31:35.960]  Smells very good.
[31:36.240 --> 31:38.380]  Not too bad in small amounts.
[31:38.780 --> 31:40.820]  A little bit of Pam, not too bad.
[31:40.820 --> 31:43.520]  The problem is I then looked at the label.
[31:43.660 --> 31:48.900]  I did further investigating on the Pam label and it says intentional misuse by deliberately
[31:48.900 --> 31:52.500]  inhaling concentrated vapors may be harmful or fatal.
[31:52.660 --> 31:55.060]  I'm not sure if my use was misuse.
[31:55.140 --> 31:56.480]  I don't know if it would be categorized.
[31:56.660 --> 31:57.700]  That could be huffing.
[31:57.980 --> 31:58.840]  Could be a huffing.
[31:58.960 --> 32:02.640]  Yeah, that's like the aerosolizing stuff they put in, right?
[32:02.920 --> 32:03.340]  Did you?
[32:03.460 --> 32:04.460]  So did you?
[32:04.600 --> 32:06.420]  You just inserted them anally, I'm guessing?
[32:06.440 --> 32:07.380]  No, I used the ketchup.
[32:08.000 --> 32:08.300]  That's what I did.
[32:08.360 --> 32:10.260]  So you ate pills with ketchup?
[32:10.260 --> 32:12.660]  Yeah, I just had some ketchup and then some spit.
[32:13.520 --> 32:15.800]  I'm impressed you even considered the Pam.
[32:16.100 --> 32:16.900]  I tried it.
[32:17.220 --> 32:18.060]  It smells good.
[32:18.300 --> 32:19.100]  Just smells like butter.
[32:19.480 --> 32:20.140]  It does smell good.
[32:20.320 --> 32:21.560]  How many calories is Pam?
[32:21.940 --> 32:22.600]  That's probably a lot.
[32:22.820 --> 32:23.960]  I'd go see, but I can't.
[32:24.060 --> 32:27.420]  I mean, it's not designed to be consumed in quantities.
[32:27.900 --> 32:29.440]  My end table looks no different.
[32:30.340 --> 32:32.160]  That photo was taken four days ago.
[32:32.600 --> 32:34.400]  Everything's still in the exact same position.
[32:34.700 --> 32:38.300]  So you're like a leaving cans around the nightstand kind of guy, huh?
[32:38.300 --> 32:40.180]  Well, when I can't walk, yeah.
[32:40.580 --> 32:41.620]  Yeah, I can't.
[32:41.660 --> 32:42.580]  Well, I'm going to do that.
[32:42.680 --> 32:43.000]  What do you mean?
[32:43.080 --> 32:43.980]  I'm not walking out.
[32:44.280 --> 32:47.600]  I just don't understand the point of a can in your own house.
[32:47.960 --> 32:49.440]  I don't understand your question.
[32:49.520 --> 32:50.100]  What does that mean?
[32:50.380 --> 32:51.200]  Like, cans are good.
[32:51.280 --> 32:51.940]  You're out and about.
[32:52.100 --> 32:54.400]  You got to store your liquid in a portable container.
[32:54.840 --> 32:57.260]  Why don't you buy like a bigger container for home use?
[32:57.400 --> 33:00.660]  And then you're not blowing through cans and leaving cans everywhere.
[33:00.860 --> 33:02.320]  I'm not leaving cans everywhere.
[33:02.660 --> 33:03.600]  My ankles sore.
[33:03.680 --> 33:04.960]  I have a fridge in my room.
[33:05.120 --> 33:07.500]  I got some Dr. Pepper to put in the thing.
[33:07.500 --> 33:09.020]  A little treat while I'm upset.
[33:09.660 --> 33:10.340]  I'm dealing with this ankle.
[33:10.860 --> 33:11.500]  You're upset.
[33:11.720 --> 33:13.100]  Yeah, I guess I have a makeshift.
[33:13.280 --> 33:13.940]  It's a little treat.
[33:14.260 --> 33:14.420]  Yeah.
[33:15.020 --> 33:15.840]  I don't know what the issue is.
[33:15.940 --> 33:18.760]  I think, uh, I think that's it for my bed issues.
[33:18.920 --> 33:20.540]  I think we went through the bedding.
[33:21.140 --> 33:23.720]  I have one other thing completely unrelated to everything.
[33:23.880 --> 33:24.960]  It's just important to note.
[33:25.100 --> 33:26.340]  I feel like I should hit on this.
[33:26.920 --> 33:27.560]  It's a scandal.
[33:27.600 --> 33:30.500]  Was the spit thing the thing you were going to make me throw up with?
[33:30.640 --> 33:32.860]  No, I still have another thing that I could read.
[33:32.880 --> 33:33.240]  Oh, God.
[33:33.720 --> 33:35.480]  Do you want to do that or do you want a quick update?
[33:35.520 --> 33:36.720]  I have the hired judge update.
[33:36.720 --> 33:37.860]  It's very small.
[33:37.880 --> 33:37.960]  Oh, yeah.
[33:38.140 --> 33:40.180]  I also I had a look because we're running out of time.
[33:40.280 --> 33:41.800]  I have three things I could talk about.
[33:41.920 --> 33:44.760]  I'll list them all and you guys can pick and then we'll just cover the others later.
[33:45.200 --> 33:45.320]  All right.
[33:45.320 --> 33:46.400]  What's your hired judge update?
[33:46.940 --> 33:50.900]  Uh, my hired judge update is, uh, as everyone knows, I'm a slippery eel.
[33:51.140 --> 33:53.380]  Apparently, uh, I was called out.
[33:53.760 --> 33:55.520]  I was kicked out by them.
[33:56.140 --> 33:57.440]  They, uh, they removed me.
[33:57.500 --> 33:58.420]  I'm on the blacklist.
[33:58.800 --> 34:01.340]  I might be the only person ever to be on that blacklist.
[34:01.600 --> 34:04.940]  But later that day, I got an email.
[34:05.460 --> 34:06.340]  I got another email.
[34:06.340 --> 34:09.340]  Very interesting one from hired judge.
[34:09.700 --> 34:11.720]  They can try to kick me out.
[34:11.980 --> 34:13.540]  They can put me in the blacklist.
[34:13.620 --> 34:15.900]  They can say whatever they want on their message boards.
[34:16.060 --> 34:17.480]  I'm still getting the emails.
[34:17.700 --> 34:19.500]  I'm getting the judging opportunities.
[34:19.820 --> 34:20.660]  I'm there.
[34:20.860 --> 34:21.400]  I'm watching.
[34:21.640 --> 34:23.580]  They can't remove me from the servers.
[34:24.300 --> 34:26.980]  They can take me out of their little feed or whatever.
[34:27.240 --> 34:28.640]  I'm still getting all the updates.
[34:28.920 --> 34:30.620]  They needed an emergency judge.
[34:30.740 --> 34:31.720]  I was available.
[34:31.980 --> 34:34.400]  I said, no, that was on them.
[34:34.960 --> 34:35.840]  They did that.
[34:37.180 --> 34:38.060]  Wait, this...
[34:38.060 --> 34:40.480]  So they're not replacing you with this, are they?
[34:40.800 --> 34:45.340]  No, they put out a thing because they're like, he's out of the system.
[34:45.340 --> 34:45.860]  He's gone.
[34:46.200 --> 34:48.200]  Little did they know, I'm still hiding in the back.
[34:48.300 --> 34:49.500]  I'm still getting the updates.
[34:49.700 --> 34:52.200]  I'm constantly still getting jobs for hired judge.
[34:52.560 --> 34:53.560]  They couldn't get rid of me.
[34:54.340 --> 34:55.380]  Easily remove you from that.
[34:55.680 --> 34:57.400]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:57.620 --> 34:58.560]  I'm still getting in there.
[34:58.680 --> 35:00.300]  They needed an emergency judge.
[35:00.520 --> 35:01.440]  I was available.
[35:02.280 --> 35:02.860]  But guess what?
[35:02.880 --> 35:03.520]  I'm blacklisted.
[35:03.520 --> 35:04.100]  Sorry.
[35:04.500 --> 35:04.940]  Out of luck.
[35:05.460 --> 35:05.980]  You did that.
[35:06.200 --> 35:07.000]  They did that to themselves.
[35:07.100 --> 35:11.180]  Someone's going to email them now and tell them to take you off the mailing list.
[35:11.300 --> 35:11.740]  Try it.
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.060]  They already tried.
[35:13.220 --> 35:14.700]  They already told me I'm on the blacklist.
[35:15.060 --> 35:15.780]  I'll wait and see.
[35:16.220 --> 35:17.220]  We'll see what happens.
[35:17.940 --> 35:18.840]  Oh, good Lord.
[35:19.120 --> 35:20.140]  I don't think they can do it.
[35:20.180 --> 35:21.040]  I don't think they know how.
[35:21.200 --> 35:22.320]  I think I'm just there.
[35:22.760 --> 35:24.740]  I wonder which judge had to back out.
[35:25.180 --> 35:25.940]  That's a great question.
[35:26.000 --> 35:26.400]  I don't know.
[35:26.960 --> 35:27.580]  I could have.
[35:27.720 --> 35:28.400]  I could have helped.
[35:28.500 --> 35:29.480]  But no, I'm blacklisted.
[35:29.880 --> 35:31.700]  I'm a slippery eel, apparently.
[35:31.700 --> 35:33.700]  So I hope it went well.
[35:33.880 --> 35:34.880]  I hope they found their judge.
[35:35.040 --> 35:36.360]  I hope they did too.
[36:18.700 --> 36:29.580]  You know, it's never too early to start gift shopping for the holidays,
[36:29.840 --> 36:33.940]  especially because today you can save big on a gift they'll use every day.
[36:33.940 --> 36:35.660]  Raycon wireless earbuds.
[36:36.400 --> 36:38.200]  I'll say this for Raycon wireless earbuds.
[36:38.380 --> 36:41.500]  I got some for my mom and she's in her 60s.
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.880]  So she is, you know, not Elon Musk with technology or anything.
[36:46.260 --> 36:49.920]  And she uses them very simply and to great success.
[36:50.300 --> 36:53.320]  And she found I didn't even have to help her set them up, which is a miracle.
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.140]  With seamless Bluetooth pairing and a comfortable noise isolating fit,
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.240]  you can start listening right away and keep listening for hours.
[37:00.380 --> 37:01.280]  They've got a good battery.
[37:01.360 --> 37:02.020]  That's what that means.
[37:02.360 --> 37:03.700]  The audio quality is amazing.
[37:03.700 --> 37:05.960]  Comparable to what you get from other premium bands,
[37:06.120 --> 37:08.060]  except Raycons start at half the price.
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.240]  So this holiday season, get them something they can use for calls or music,
[37:12.580 --> 37:15.760]  work or play, home or on the go.
[37:16.120 --> 37:17.620]  It's either or thing all the way through there.
[37:17.900 --> 37:19.560]  Or hell, pick up a pair for yourself.
[37:19.840 --> 37:22.060]  Trust me, you're going to use them every day.
[37:22.500 --> 37:25.600]  Earbuds have become like a basic human right.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.620]  You know, like the right to food and water and shelter and earbuds
[37:30.620 --> 37:32.140]  for your phone calls in public.
[37:32.140 --> 37:37.820]  Go to buyraycon.com slash face today to get 20% off your Raycon order.
[37:38.180 --> 37:38.700]  But hurry.
[37:40.980 --> 37:42.140]  Seriously, though, hurry.
[37:42.340 --> 37:45.900]  This offer is available for a limited time only and you don't want to miss it.
[37:46.280 --> 37:52.180]  That's buyraycon.com slash face to get 20% off your Raycons.
[37:52.420 --> 37:54.900]  Buyraycon.com slash face.
[37:54.900 --> 38:03.220]  That's B-U-Y-R-A-Y-C-O-N dot com slash F-A-C-E face.
[38:03.680 --> 38:05.780]  All right, let's get into the down and dirty.
[38:05.940 --> 38:10.040]  Let's talk about how easy and stress free HelloFresh is.
[38:10.260 --> 38:12.200]  They offer convenient no contact delivery,
[38:12.380 --> 38:15.760]  which I'm sure we all can agree is important in this day and age.
[38:15.980 --> 38:17.360]  It comes right to your doorstep.
[38:17.700 --> 38:19.400]  Easy home cooking for the family.
[38:19.720 --> 38:21.000]  The recipes are easy to follow.
[38:21.400 --> 38:24.000]  Even I can follow them and I can barely read.
[38:24.000 --> 38:24.940]  I grew up in Alabama.
[38:25.400 --> 38:26.700]  I think you know where I'm going with that.
[38:26.980 --> 38:30.580]  But simple steps and pictures, pictures help me guide you along the way.
[38:30.900 --> 38:33.240]  They cut out the stressful meal planning and grocery store trips.
[38:33.320 --> 38:35.740]  I don't know about you guys, but I try to be responsible
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.200]  and make a list on Sunday of all the things I think I need.
[38:39.280 --> 38:41.000]  And then what happens is by Wednesday,
[38:41.320 --> 38:44.320]  I realize I didn't get half of what I needed and I'm not going to eat
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.540]  like at least 25% of the other crap that I got.
[38:46.620 --> 38:47.560]  And so it's going to go bad.
[38:47.680 --> 38:49.460]  It's a vicious cycle.
[38:50.040 --> 38:51.560]  And HelloFresh has helped me break out of it.
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.840]  They deliver fresh, high quality, pre-proportioned ingredients.
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.360]  So you make the meals that are delicious and nutritious
[38:57.360 --> 38:59.200]  and you don't end up with a lot of overage.
[38:59.260 --> 38:59.960]  You don't know what to do with it.
[38:59.980 --> 39:01.940]  You're like, I got a half a celery stalk now.
[39:02.160 --> 39:03.960]  I only knew how to make one thing with celery.
[39:04.360 --> 39:06.000]  What am I supposed to do with this celery stalk?
[39:06.360 --> 39:08.540]  I'll pretend like I'm going to eat it maybe with peanut butter.
[39:08.620 --> 39:10.120]  But what will really happen is in three weeks,
[39:10.140 --> 39:12.380]  I'll see it in the crisper and I'll throw it away and think,
[39:12.500 --> 39:13.360]  well, that was a waste of money.
[39:13.660 --> 39:14.580]  Not with HelloFresh.
[39:14.660 --> 39:15.040]  It's not.
[39:15.160 --> 39:16.560]  They help you eat more sustainably.
[39:16.680 --> 39:19.380]  It's the first global carbon neutral meal kit company,
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.060]  which is an easy thing to say.
[39:21.060 --> 39:23.040]  Obviously, rolls right off the tongue.
[39:23.460 --> 39:25.840]  But by skipping the grocery store and using HelloFresh,
[39:26.060 --> 39:28.400]  you're reducing food waste by at least 25%,
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.700]  like that celery stalk I was talking about earlier.
[39:31.180 --> 39:33.100]  The packaging used to ship your food
[39:33.100 --> 39:35.020]  is almost entirely made from recyclable
[39:35.020 --> 39:36.760]  or already recycled content.
[39:37.240 --> 39:38.980]  Kind of like all of our jokes for the last 10 years,
[39:39.080 --> 39:40.180]  just continually recycled
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.260]  because we care about the environment.
[39:41.820 --> 39:43.040]  It's great for your lifestyle.
[39:43.260 --> 39:44.580]  You can change your delivery days
[39:44.580 --> 39:45.880]  or your meal plan preferences.
[39:46.440 --> 39:47.460]  You can skip a week.
[39:47.740 --> 39:49.560]  You know, when you decide your keto for a month,
[39:49.620 --> 39:50.600]  you can switch to that.
[39:50.600 --> 39:52.200]  Then when you realize you want bread again,
[39:52.260 --> 39:53.120]  you can switch back.
[39:53.500 --> 39:54.060]  They don't care.
[39:54.480 --> 39:57.780]  Go to hellofresh.com slash face 90.
[39:58.020 --> 40:02.220]  That's F-A-C-E 9-0 and use code face 90.
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.460]  Once again, that's F-A-C-E 9-0 to get $90 off,
[40:06.560 --> 40:07.720]  including free shipping.
[40:08.020 --> 40:10.640]  Go to hellofresh.com slash face 90.
[40:10.820 --> 40:14.440]  That's F-A-C-E 9-0 and use code face 90
[40:14.440 --> 40:16.860]  to get $90 off, including free shipping.
[40:18.580 --> 40:19.660]  What's your update, Geoff?
[40:19.660 --> 40:20.780]  Okay, here's...
[40:20.780 --> 40:22.400]  Well, maybe we have time to get into more than one,
[40:22.480 --> 40:23.160]  but here's the deal.
[40:23.420 --> 40:24.260]  I'll let you guys pick.
[40:25.120 --> 40:30.220]  License plate or flat tire or blow dryer.
[40:30.460 --> 40:32.800]  Those are the three notes I had to talk about.
[40:33.080 --> 40:34.620]  Blow dryer, in my opinion.
[40:34.860 --> 40:35.160]  Gavin?
[40:35.520 --> 40:36.220]  Yeah, let's go with that.
[40:36.260 --> 40:36.460]  All right.
[40:36.540 --> 40:39.120]  Well, the blow dryer is the second shortest story.
[40:40.040 --> 40:41.440]  The flat tire being the longest.
[40:41.940 --> 40:44.480]  I have taken Andrew to heart a little bit
[40:44.480 --> 40:46.880]  and him finding efficiencies in life.
[40:47.380 --> 40:50.160]  And I started a few years ago blow drying my hair
[40:50.600 --> 40:51.920]  and I really got into it.
[40:51.960 --> 40:54.780]  I always thought that was like for people that had fancy hair
[40:54.780 --> 40:58.800]  and I was just like a dumb army kid
[40:58.800 --> 41:01.080]  who you just towel it dry and go about your day.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.440]  But I started blow drying my hair
[41:03.440 --> 41:06.060]  and I found I really liked the ceremony of it all.
[41:06.160 --> 41:07.100]  And I liked the feeling.
[41:07.940 --> 41:09.420]  And I have done this off and on,
[41:09.560 --> 41:10.680]  but never with any...
[41:10.680 --> 41:11.720]  throughout the course of my life,
[41:11.780 --> 41:13.560]  but never with any intent or purpose.
[41:14.260 --> 41:16.380]  And now I've started when I get out of the shower,
[41:16.380 --> 41:17.220]  I towel off.
[41:17.320 --> 41:18.840]  But you know when you get out of the shower,
[41:18.980 --> 41:20.860]  no matter how long you towel off,
[41:20.900 --> 41:22.400]  you're still damp in certain places
[41:22.400 --> 41:25.760]  and there becomes a point of diminishing returns, right?
[41:25.780 --> 41:26.260]  Where you're like,
[41:26.420 --> 41:30.100]  I could continue drying off with this towel that's now wet,
[41:30.260 --> 41:32.420]  but I'm getting less and less dry per,
[41:32.700 --> 41:34.380]  you know, by percentage as I go.
[41:35.640 --> 41:37.140]  At some point, the towel...
[41:37.140 --> 41:39.380]  you're not going to dry off with two towels, right?
[41:39.560 --> 41:40.400]  Nobody's going to be like,
[41:40.420 --> 41:41.440]  well, this towel is mostly wet.
[41:41.700 --> 41:43.420]  Let me get the second towel to finish the job.
[41:43.640 --> 41:44.580]  You're just not going to do that.
[41:44.580 --> 41:46.900]  But since I'm already blow drying my hair,
[41:47.060 --> 41:48.380]  I've started to do...
[41:48.380 --> 41:51.600]  I got this routine where I put my deodorant on
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.200]  and then I blow dry the deodorant dry onto my underarm.
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.240]  That way you don't like put a black shirt on
[41:57.240 --> 41:58.920]  and end up with like the white streaks or whatever.
[41:59.180 --> 42:00.060]  Or you don't like...
[42:00.060 --> 42:01.040]  if you use clear deodorant,
[42:01.200 --> 42:02.720]  you don't put it on and just feel like icky,
[42:02.880 --> 42:04.240]  kind of sticky a little bit.
[42:04.340 --> 42:05.860]  So I blow dry my arms,
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.060]  my underarms totally dry to like bake the deodorant on.
[42:10.240 --> 42:10.980]  It takes a few seconds.
[42:11.320 --> 42:13.800]  Then I blow dry the rest of my entire body,
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.200]  paying special attention to my...
[42:16.200 --> 42:19.180]  my shins seem to hold a lot of water for some reason.
[42:19.700 --> 42:21.040]  What do you mean?
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.980]  They always seem to be a little wetter.
[42:23.100 --> 42:23.540]  Or maybe it's a...
[42:23.540 --> 42:24.780]  Is it a hair thing?
[42:24.980 --> 42:26.180]  You got hairy shins.
[42:26.300 --> 42:27.520]  I got hairy legs, right?
[42:27.620 --> 42:27.980]  I guess so.
[42:28.160 --> 42:29.460]  Not my Gavin hairy or anything,
[42:29.600 --> 42:30.620]  but you know, I'm human.
[42:31.500 --> 42:34.600]  And so I pay special attention to my shins,
[42:34.620 --> 42:36.080]  make sure my leg hair gets nice and dry,
[42:36.160 --> 42:37.440]  which feels lovely, by the way.
[42:37.580 --> 42:42.620]  And then I blow dry my butthole and my taint and my balls for a while.
[42:42.620 --> 42:43.740]  You got to be careful
[42:43.740 --> 42:46.760]  because you will burn your dick on a high setting with a blow dryer.
[42:46.940 --> 42:48.860]  But if you like, if you, you know,
[42:49.300 --> 42:50.800]  and I don't like to dial it down.
[42:50.900 --> 42:52.080]  I like to keep my settings on high
[42:52.080 --> 42:54.620]  because I like to because I like go 100% all the time.
[42:55.040 --> 42:56.360]  But so you have to be careful.
[42:56.800 --> 42:57.960]  But can I ask a technical question?
[42:58.240 --> 42:58.480]  Yeah.
[42:58.660 --> 43:02.160]  Are you using the incredibly fancy and expensive Dyson blow dryer?
[43:02.740 --> 43:03.520]  Yes, I am.
[43:03.720 --> 43:04.240]  Okay, nice.
[43:04.760 --> 43:07.300]  Oh, I'm just wondering what kind of blow you're getting.
[43:07.420 --> 43:08.340]  Just a Dyson blow dryer.
[43:08.500 --> 43:08.660]  Yeah.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.260]  And I have not been happier.
[43:11.260 --> 43:16.360]  There is something to be said about completely and totally dry warming your body
[43:16.360 --> 43:20.020]  and then putting on a pair of underwear and a pair of pants and a pair of socks.
[43:20.400 --> 43:21.360]  It's different.
[43:21.560 --> 43:23.940]  I'm telling you, it hits different.
[43:24.440 --> 43:26.400]  And I cannot recommend it enough.
[43:26.740 --> 43:28.260]  Blow dry your whole body.
[43:28.280 --> 43:29.560]  Getting dressed a little bit damp.
[43:29.560 --> 43:30.420]  Just normally.
[43:30.600 --> 43:31.640]  And then you like, you put your underwear on.
[43:31.700 --> 43:33.560]  You're like, oh, it's a little damp there.
[43:33.720 --> 43:34.780]  Or like a pair of socks.
[43:34.800 --> 43:37.700]  And like one sock goes on a little harder than the other sock.
[43:37.740 --> 43:40.940]  And you realize, oh, I didn't dry my foot as well as the other foot.
[43:40.940 --> 43:42.440]  It happens.
[43:42.800 --> 43:43.040]  All right.
[43:43.200 --> 43:43.400]  Sure.
[43:43.500 --> 43:44.820]  And I know you know what I'm talking about.
[43:45.080 --> 43:50.280]  But if you just dry the whole thing, give yourself an extra, I don't know,
[43:50.380 --> 43:53.440]  80 seconds in the bathroom with the blow dryer.
[43:54.040 --> 43:55.420]  It'll set your day.
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.020]  I'm telling you, you will like, it's kind of like how they say, like, make your bed in the morning
[43:59.020 --> 44:01.300]  and you'll feel better throughout the rest of the day.
[44:01.420 --> 44:02.180]  I subscribe to that.
[44:02.240 --> 44:02.900]  I do it still.
[44:03.780 --> 44:05.560]  It's the first thing I do when I get up, make my bed.
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.360]  I'm sorry, I make our bed.
[44:07.580 --> 44:08.180]  Emily and I's bed.
[44:08.740 --> 44:12.220]  But I have now, like, I feel like I have better days
[44:12.220 --> 44:15.520]  because I blow dry my butt and my balls and my legs.
[44:15.860 --> 44:17.460]  And I recommend you do the same.
[44:17.760 --> 44:18.380]  It's like a hug.
[44:18.660 --> 44:21.740]  You're just kind of giving yourself a little nice little warm hug slip into that underwear.
[44:21.880 --> 44:22.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:22.520 --> 44:23.340]  You don't have to heat up.
[44:23.500 --> 44:26.540]  It makes clothes feel like, you know how when you put on a pair of pants or a shirt
[44:26.540 --> 44:29.500]  straight out of the dryer and they're kind of like warm and huggy.
[44:29.640 --> 44:32.340]  It makes all clothes feel like they came straight out of the dryer
[44:32.340 --> 44:33.960]  because your body is that warm.
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.160]  It is a dangerous game.
[44:35.160 --> 44:38.520]  Eventually, do you think you'll upgrade to a second hairdryer
[44:38.520 --> 44:41.040]  so you can get it done in twice, twice the speed?
[44:41.260 --> 44:41.860]  I'm not in a hurry.
[44:42.240 --> 44:43.320]  I think that's too dangerous.
[44:43.480 --> 44:45.500]  I'm learning to take and I agree with Andrew.
[44:45.580 --> 44:46.220]  It could be dangerous.
[44:46.540 --> 44:48.960]  I'm learning to take time to enjoy stuff.
[44:49.060 --> 44:49.720]  I don't know, man.
[44:49.740 --> 44:51.900]  You bring it in like you're dealing with precious parts.
[44:52.300 --> 44:54.020]  And yeah, he said he burnt his dick.
[44:54.360 --> 44:55.900]  I have burned my dick.
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.740]  Having two, it's just like you're factoring in a lot of different heat.
[44:58.880 --> 44:59.600]  You're moving all over.
[44:59.780 --> 45:02.720]  You got to bifurcate your brain and like, think about like you
[45:02.720 --> 45:04.900]  deal with two different heat streams at the same time.
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.500]  Like you're micro, you suddenly you're multitasking.
[45:07.860 --> 45:10.960]  My lights drop to like 50% brightness when I turn on my hairdryer.
[45:11.020 --> 45:12.060]  So maybe they go all the way off.
[45:13.500 --> 45:14.800]  You need to test that.
[45:16.100 --> 45:16.880]  That's interesting.
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.080]  Michael does that, you know, he stands there completely naked and blows himself dry.
[45:21.760 --> 45:22.060]  Smart dude.
[45:22.300 --> 45:24.420]  Dry being important for that sentence.
[45:24.860 --> 45:25.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[45:25.880 --> 45:28.040]  No, I, I, I, I support it.
[45:28.060 --> 45:29.500]  And I recommend everybody try it.
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.300]  I'll try a waffle.
[45:30.420 --> 45:31.140]  I could do with that.
[45:31.140 --> 45:33.300]  That might help me out when people arrive early.
[45:33.400 --> 45:37.300]  Because as you know, I'm putting on shirts and the chest hair is still wet.
[45:37.600 --> 45:38.840]  I got like a cup of water.
[45:38.920 --> 45:40.940]  I got like a whole cup stored in my chest.
[45:41.480 --> 45:42.380]  And then it looks like dry.
[45:42.500 --> 45:45.320]  You come to the front door and it looks like you've been working out or something.
[45:45.440 --> 45:46.620]  And you've got a sweaty chest.
[45:46.700 --> 45:47.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.980]  I'm on board with most of what you said, except for the shins thing.
[45:51.000 --> 45:51.940]  That was insanity.
[45:52.320 --> 45:53.960]  Just kick your legs a few times.
[45:54.060 --> 45:54.800]  A little water will come off.
[45:55.220 --> 45:57.100]  You got like a sponge shin.
[45:57.360 --> 45:59.300]  Don't knock it till you shin try it.
[45:59.300 --> 46:04.060]  I will say the shin thing is also puzzling because you're wearing swim trunks all the time.
[46:04.160 --> 46:06.000]  So I don't know why the shins are an area.
[46:06.340 --> 46:08.240]  Well, you know, I have been wearing pants lately.
[46:08.700 --> 46:09.360]  Why? Really?
[46:09.740 --> 46:12.360]  Well, there have been some days when it's been cooler.
[46:13.100 --> 46:16.820]  And like sometimes when I go for my bike ride, it's only in the 50s.
[46:17.040 --> 46:18.560]  I don't want to wear shorts in the 50s.
[46:18.560 --> 46:19.680]  So I'll put on a pair of pants.
[46:19.700 --> 46:20.400]  You don't want shinsicles.
[46:20.960 --> 46:22.140]  Yeah, I don't want shinsicles.
[46:22.460 --> 46:24.240]  They fucking yeah, I could lose my legs.
[46:24.720 --> 46:25.700]  No, it's fine.
[46:26.200 --> 46:28.640]  It's actually nice when you do that when it's cold.
[46:28.640 --> 46:32.220]  And your feet get cold and you heat them up.
[46:32.620 --> 46:34.240]  There comes a time like.
[46:34.620 --> 46:35.100]  What do you mean?
[46:36.500 --> 46:37.760]  It's nice sometimes.
[46:37.760 --> 46:40.040]  So I only wear shorts or underwear.
[46:40.220 --> 46:40.980]  I've never there never.
[46:41.120 --> 46:42.420]  There's never a pants situation.
[46:42.920 --> 46:44.980]  Very rarely fabric around my feet.
[46:45.080 --> 46:46.120]  You have to get them hemmed.
[46:46.380 --> 46:47.620]  Yeah, it's like a whole thing.
[46:47.720 --> 46:48.980]  It's a whole nonsense, a headache.
[46:49.120 --> 46:50.600]  I don't I want my legs to feel free.
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.300]  And I also used to love always having my window open year round.
[46:54.400 --> 46:55.140]  Doesn't matter when.
[46:55.140 --> 46:59.240]  So there'd be times in the winter months where I'd be at my desk,
[46:59.320 --> 47:01.240]  like I'd be playing a game for a few hours at night,
[47:01.420 --> 47:04.020]  and then the cold would just completely numb my feet.
[47:04.240 --> 47:07.660]  And then you'd go to bed and your feet would slowly heat up.
[47:07.820 --> 47:08.760]  And it was a nice feeling.
[47:09.180 --> 47:09.960]  It's not always bad.
[47:10.080 --> 47:10.860]  That's all I was trying to say.
[47:11.160 --> 47:14.320]  OK, I thought you I thought you're going to be like heating by the fire or something.
[47:14.600 --> 47:16.280]  No, you just go on the bed and you slowly.
[47:16.940 --> 47:18.700]  Have you ever had chill blains?
[47:19.280 --> 47:19.900]  Chill blains?
[47:20.480 --> 47:20.860]  Have you?
[47:21.260 --> 47:22.820]  No, but I was always warned about it.
[47:22.820 --> 47:25.920]  If you have really cold feet and then you immediately heat them up,
[47:25.980 --> 47:27.900]  you can get is it chill blains?
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.020]  I've never looked up what that is.
[47:30.040 --> 47:31.700]  I don't even I've never heard that word.
[47:31.960 --> 47:33.680]  It's like, oh, you'll get chill blains.
[47:34.280 --> 47:35.020]  That's just bad.
[47:35.480 --> 47:36.280]  I gotta look up what that is.
[47:37.200 --> 47:38.720]  I had an anal fissure recently.
[47:39.480 --> 47:40.980]  I haven't had a chill blain though.
[47:42.360 --> 47:45.040]  I would say that that's worse.
[47:45.280 --> 47:48.820]  There goes the there goes the license plate and the flat tire.
[47:49.140 --> 47:51.060]  Andrew, would you would you care?
[47:51.060 --> 47:52.640]  My second waffle maker just shipped.
[47:53.200 --> 47:53.920]  That's great.
[47:54.280 --> 47:54.820]  Sorry, go ahead.
[47:55.360 --> 47:58.960]  Well, first off, is the second waffle maker teeny weeny turtles?
[47:59.300 --> 47:59.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:59.900 --> 48:01.960]  I wanted to secure a backup just in case.
[48:02.080 --> 48:02.600]  OK, that's fair.
[48:02.800 --> 48:03.080]  Something went wrong.
[48:03.340 --> 48:04.800]  Uh, what's up with the anal fissure?
[48:05.080 --> 48:06.280]  It was a side effect.
[48:06.380 --> 48:08.100]  So I was recovering from my.
[48:08.200 --> 48:09.540]  I've been eating so many goddamn waffles.
[48:10.480 --> 48:11.360]  Yeah, yes.
[48:11.500 --> 48:12.940]  No, it wasn't waffle related.
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.480]  It was the prescription painkiller related.
[48:15.620 --> 48:20.520]  I was saving my ankle to spite my butthole is what I didn't realize at the time.
[48:20.920 --> 48:22.020]  And it was bad.
[48:22.140 --> 48:24.340]  Is this going to make me throw up?
[48:24.400 --> 48:25.360]  No, I don't think so.
[48:25.500 --> 48:28.480]  It's just it's like I was shitting at a rock and it was awful.
[48:28.800 --> 48:29.880]  It's a terrible experience.
[48:30.200 --> 48:34.440]  You know, when you bite like dentine, icy, fresh gum and you get like that freshness
[48:34.440 --> 48:35.640]  in your mouth, that freshness.
[48:36.100 --> 48:39.080]  Yeah, that's how my asshole felt for like three hours.
[48:40.720 --> 48:42.720]  And at first it was pleasant.
[48:42.840 --> 48:44.440]  I was like, this isn't that bad.
[48:44.720 --> 48:47.740]  This is like someone squirted a bunch of tea tree up your asshole.
[48:47.740 --> 48:50.600]  Yeah, like it was kind of a cooling, numbing feeling.
[48:50.780 --> 48:52.960]  It was a dentine, fresh feeling in my asshole.
[48:54.180 --> 48:57.660]  But then it just shifted the pain and then it was just really sore.
[48:58.280 --> 49:00.020]  And I don't know exactly what.
[49:00.180 --> 49:01.340]  Maybe it wasn't an anal fissure.
[49:01.800 --> 49:02.140]  Read online.
[49:02.140 --> 49:03.040]  You're just guessing.
[49:03.500 --> 49:05.220]  Well, the symptoms matched up.
[49:05.300 --> 49:08.600]  I didn't hire a fucking team of investigators to check in on Gavin.
[49:09.440 --> 49:10.340]  We established last episode.
[49:10.420 --> 49:12.520]  He's not leaving his house to go to the doctor or anything.
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.420]  So I just I went to bed and I woke up the next day and it was fine.
[49:16.420 --> 49:17.800]  But it was a unique pain.
[49:17.960 --> 49:20.400]  And I think something probably a little tear.
[49:20.540 --> 49:21.480]  I probably had a little tear.
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.000]  Well, was there blood in your stool or on the paper?
[49:25.340 --> 49:26.220]  I didn't observe either.
[49:26.480 --> 49:27.240]  I don't know.
[49:27.320 --> 49:31.300]  OK, so you're shitting rocks, but you don't think,
[49:31.440 --> 49:33.560]  Oh, I should probably have a peek at what that was.
[49:33.720 --> 49:35.420]  And you're shitting and wiping blind?
[49:36.080 --> 49:36.780]  No. Yeah, I did.
[49:36.820 --> 49:37.740]  I was wiping blind.
[49:38.160 --> 49:39.680]  I made sure everything was fine.
[49:40.020 --> 49:40.440]  How do you know you're done?
[49:40.680 --> 49:41.840]  Yeah. How do you know it's clean?
[49:42.320 --> 49:43.260]  I just you can feel.
[49:43.680 --> 49:45.120]  Gavin, you can't feel at that time.
[49:45.280 --> 49:45.960]  No, it's not.
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.460]  No. OK, hear me out.
[49:47.500 --> 49:49.320]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[49:49.320 --> 49:51.460]  Shut up for a minute.
[49:51.660 --> 49:52.240]  Let me talk.
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.620]  You can tell when you're having a bad one or a good one that you can also.
[49:58.240 --> 49:59.060]  Mostly, yes.
[49:59.140 --> 50:03.820]  90% Yes, but sometimes you can have a really confident wipe and think
[50:03.820 --> 50:05.820]  I've absolutely nailed that one.
[50:05.820 --> 50:08.800]  And then you look down and it's an absolute pooh bar.
[50:08.940 --> 50:09.780]  No, no, no.
[50:09.780 --> 50:10.820]  I never had that.
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.900]  I bet a very high percentage of accurately projecting.
[50:16.420 --> 50:17.760]  You can't, you don't verify it!
[50:17.760 --> 50:19.760]  You don't know because you're not looking, you're not verifying.
[50:20.280 --> 50:21.440]  I would gather on this one.
[50:21.820 --> 50:23.600]  There are times in your life when you go,
[50:23.660 --> 50:25.700]  I was way off base on that one.
[50:26.220 --> 50:26.900]  This is the thing.
[50:27.920 --> 50:29.560]  Literally, it was shitting rocks.
[50:29.700 --> 50:31.980]  There was no substance to this, there was no smearing.
[50:32.560 --> 50:34.140]  There was nothing there.
[50:34.660 --> 50:35.380]  And then I thought,
[50:35.540 --> 50:37.680]  I wonder if they were like,
[50:37.720 --> 50:39.260]  how big that was, that felt horrible.
[50:39.340 --> 50:41.400]  It was the worst feeling I've ever had.
[50:41.520 --> 50:43.360]  I've never passed a kidney stone,
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.380]  but I imagine it felt like that,
[50:45.480 --> 50:47.000]  but my asshole, yeah.
[50:47.060 --> 50:47.920]  It was terrible.
[50:48.340 --> 50:50.260]  By the way, Nick, in all caps, has written,
[50:50.440 --> 50:52.300]  you were pantsless the last week.
[50:52.480 --> 50:52.960]  Yeah, I was.
[50:53.740 --> 50:56.880]  You were sitting down on unverified wipes.
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.120]  No, it's fine.
[51:00.020 --> 51:01.180]  I clearly was right,
[51:01.240 --> 51:01.920]  because there are no stains.
[51:03.220 --> 51:05.400]  Now we know why he's buying new bedsheets, Gavin.
[51:05.720 --> 51:07.120]  No, I literally ripped them in half.
[51:07.200 --> 51:08.500]  I'll take a photo if I need to.
[51:08.580 --> 51:10.160]  It's like they were split down the middle.
[51:11.400 --> 51:12.840]  So I did that,
[51:12.980 --> 51:14.340]  and I did go to check,
[51:14.460 --> 51:15.820]  but the light was off, and I couldn't see.
[51:15.940 --> 51:18.420]  So I just accepted that I wouldn't know what they looked like.
[51:18.500 --> 51:19.440]  Where's the light switch?
[51:19.700 --> 51:21.220]  It's on the other side of the wall.
[51:21.400 --> 51:23.720]  I couldn't reach it at that time.
[51:24.220 --> 51:26.420]  I'd have to hobble over, hit the switch,
[51:26.480 --> 51:28.120]  and then hobble back to get a peek.
[51:28.460 --> 51:30.340]  So you didn't have an itchy butt or anything?
[51:30.680 --> 51:30.960]  No.
[51:31.180 --> 51:32.040]  You really were Winnie the Pooh.
[51:32.300 --> 51:36.480]  No, it was an icy feel that was really nice
[51:36.480 --> 51:37.620]  for maybe two hours,
[51:37.620 --> 51:39.480]  and then it was just constant pain.
[51:41.060 --> 51:43.620]  We need to get this kid a bidet ASAP.
[51:44.620 --> 51:46.020]  He had the opportunity.
[51:46.240 --> 51:47.940]  He didn't want it because he's a vertical wiper.
[51:48.280 --> 51:48.680]  It's fine.
[51:48.880 --> 51:51.060]  I'm telling you, it works for vertical wipers.
[51:52.500 --> 51:53.140]  I'm sure it does.
[51:54.300 --> 51:56.080]  I'm going through changes enough as it is.
[51:56.180 --> 51:57.640]  I got these waffle makers, Geoff.
[51:57.680 --> 51:59.460]  I got a hot dog. I'm making desk dogs.
[51:59.580 --> 52:01.840]  He's going through changes that are filling up his bathroom.
[52:01.960 --> 52:03.820]  He doesn't have room for things like bidets.
[52:04.580 --> 52:06.600]  Gavin, I don't know if it's the same for you,
[52:06.600 --> 52:07.380]  but I just went,
[52:07.900 --> 52:10.080]  I guess two weeks ago now,
[52:10.160 --> 52:12.540]  I went on that road trip up to Detroit and back,
[52:12.880 --> 52:14.340]  so I didn't have the bidet with me
[52:14.340 --> 52:16.640]  for seven days, eight days.
[52:17.160 --> 52:18.680]  And man, you instantly
[52:19.580 --> 52:20.800]  notice the absence
[52:20.800 --> 52:22.540]  of the bidet when you have to go back
[52:22.540 --> 52:23.260]  to dry wiping.
[52:23.760 --> 52:26.600]  It feels like you're going back
[52:26.600 --> 52:28.100]  in time to the caveman days.
[52:28.400 --> 52:30.840]  I'm telling you, Andrew, you would be so instantly
[52:30.840 --> 52:33.120]  converted, and I would
[52:33.120 --> 52:34.520]  be more comfortable knowing,
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.500]  especially if I ever come to visit you,
[52:36.600 --> 52:38.720]  that if you're walking around Donald Ducking
[52:38.720 --> 52:40.480]  it or Winnie the Poohing it around your apartment
[52:40.480 --> 52:42.100]  90% of the time, that
[52:42.100 --> 52:44.380]  there's going to be a much higher percentage
[52:44.380 --> 52:45.820]  that I'm going to sit down in a clean seat.
[52:46.020 --> 52:48.540]  I almost never am in
[52:48.540 --> 52:49.500]  Winnie the Pooh mode.
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.060]  It's a rare occurrence.
[52:52.180 --> 52:54.040]  With my injury, it wasn't worth it.
[52:54.580 --> 52:56.360]  I completely agree with you. I'm sure
[52:56.360 --> 52:58.540]  I'd be converted easily, but I'm also
[52:58.540 --> 53:00.440]  scared to take on new things that I would
[53:00.440 --> 53:01.760]  then have a hard time being without.
[53:01.760 --> 53:03.860]  One of the reasons I don't drink coffee.
[53:04.060 --> 53:05.800]  I don't like the idea of feeling like
[53:05.800 --> 53:07.500]  what if I need coffee and I can't get it?
[53:08.000 --> 53:08.740]  If I don't drink coffee.
[53:08.960 --> 53:12.000]  Let me reassure you here. You can get coffee
[53:12.000 --> 53:12.680]  everywhere.
[53:13.440 --> 53:15.420]  Yeah, but what if...
[53:15.420 --> 53:17.540]  You go to a bank and get coffee.
[53:17.660 --> 53:19.680]  There's nowhere that doesn't have coffee.
[53:19.720 --> 53:21.760]  What if the coffee just goes away one day?
[53:21.880 --> 53:23.540]  Everyone else is stuck on this coffee.
[53:23.640 --> 53:25.600]  I'm fine. It doesn't make a difference to my life.
[53:25.680 --> 53:27.760]  It's not like smack. It's not like you're
[53:27.760 --> 53:29.880]  going to die from going cold turkey and relapsing.
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.660]  I've become reliant on the coffee
[53:31.660 --> 53:33.900]  and the energy. I just don't drink coffee.
[53:34.280 --> 53:34.980]  Or tea or anything.
[53:35.600 --> 53:36.540]  I'm not a caffeine person.
[53:36.920 --> 53:38.760]  Do you drink Dr. Pepper?
[53:39.160 --> 53:41.340]  I know, but that's a regular.
[53:41.480 --> 53:42.820]  I'm not a big caffeine guy.
[53:43.180 --> 53:44.140]  What's the worst that could happen?
[53:45.560 --> 53:47.280]  Something could though. That's my point.
[53:47.360 --> 53:48.920]  If I don't do anything, nothing will happen.
[53:48.940 --> 53:51.540]  He'll get debilitatingly addicted to coffee
[53:51.540 --> 53:53.620]  and then somehow all the world's
[53:53.620 --> 53:55.020]  coffee stores will disappear
[53:55.020 --> 53:57.940]  and like the rest of us, he'll be without coffee
[53:57.940 --> 53:58.960]  and then he'll be sad.
[54:00.100 --> 54:02.160]  He's planning his life around that
[54:02.160 --> 54:03.220]  potentiality.
[54:04.620 --> 54:05.740]  He lives
[54:05.740 --> 54:07.600]  on potential risk.
[54:07.840 --> 54:09.980]  He sculpts his life around the what-ifs.
[54:10.760 --> 54:11.160]  No I don't.
[54:11.340 --> 54:12.540]  You're all about the comfort.
[54:14.660 --> 54:15.840]  It's all backwards.
[54:16.080 --> 54:18.020]  You won't have to catch up the right way up
[54:18.020 --> 54:19.040]  because of the what-ifs.
[54:19.300 --> 54:21.640]  But you won't not put a waffle maker
[54:21.640 --> 54:23.620]  in the bathroom aside from
[54:23.620 --> 54:26.260]  the electrocution and poo what-ifs.
[54:26.260 --> 54:27.640]  It's all backwards.
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.880]  I got ketchup on my shirt that morning.
[54:29.960 --> 54:31.700]  That's why it's up. That wasn't a what-if.
[54:31.860 --> 54:33.020]  That was a live the life.
[54:33.180 --> 54:35.760]  You gotta not be clenched.
[54:36.120 --> 54:37.560]  I'm not clenched.
[54:37.780 --> 54:40.180]  I'm telling you. There was some previous air
[54:40.180 --> 54:41.840]  in the bottle. It was near the bottom.
[54:41.980 --> 54:42.980]  There was some trapped air.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.260]  You don't want to store ketchup in a vacuum.
[54:46.800 --> 54:49.340]  It's normal to just flip open.
[54:50.200 --> 54:50.700]  There was some
[54:50.700 --> 54:52.140]  forward momentum, Gavin.
[54:52.260 --> 54:53.600]  That lid was holding back.
[54:53.600 --> 54:55.300]  It was just waiting to go. It was like a trap.
[54:55.540 --> 54:56.820]  It was a sprung trap.
[54:57.160 --> 54:59.620]  As soon as I opened that lid, ketchup everywhere.
[54:59.880 --> 55:01.840]  Here's where you shouldn't
[55:01.840 --> 55:03.600]  have ketchup stored downwards.
[55:04.020 --> 55:05.300]  If you're on a plane
[55:05.300 --> 55:07.100]  and it was stored downwards
[55:07.100 --> 55:09.120]  at zero feet and you're opening it
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.460]  at 38,000.
[55:11.440 --> 55:13.160]  That's going to be a risk.
[55:13.640 --> 55:15.440]  In your bedroom, depending
[55:15.440 --> 55:17.320]  on if you've taken it to the top of Pillow Mountain,
[55:17.660 --> 55:19.380]  you should be fine to just
[55:19.380 --> 55:20.580]  flip open the cap.
[55:20.580 --> 55:22.800]  I do put my ice cream
[55:22.800 --> 55:24.540]  down. Does that make you happy?
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.800]  The lid down on the ice cream. I do that.
[55:27.680 --> 55:28.800]  I don't know, Gav.
[55:28.920 --> 55:29.760]  I don't know what he means.
[55:30.860 --> 55:32.980]  I put lid down for the ice cream.
[55:33.100 --> 55:34.560]  The ice cream's frozen.
[55:34.860 --> 55:36.460]  What do you mean? The ice cream doesn't...
[55:36.460 --> 55:37.240]  What do you mean?
[55:38.660 --> 55:39.980]  It's frozen solid.
[55:39.980 --> 55:43.240]  You make fun of me all you want.
[55:43.500 --> 55:44.860]  I put the ice cream
[55:44.860 --> 55:47.020]  lid down. Not base down.
[55:47.220 --> 55:48.740]  Lid down because it's
[55:48.740 --> 55:49.860]  better for the ice cream.
[55:50.080 --> 55:52.960]  What do you mean? How is it better for the ice cream?
[55:53.280 --> 55:54.840]  It does because the moisture,
[55:55.080 --> 55:56.460]  the way the moisture processes
[55:56.460 --> 55:57.960]  in the thing...
[55:57.960 --> 55:59.440]  in the freezer, I'm saying.
[56:00.300 --> 56:02.800]  I'm not just putting this on a table. When I put the ice cream
[56:02.800 --> 56:04.840]  in the freezer, you always go lid down.
[56:05.360 --> 56:06.740]  Are you saying that...
[56:08.940 --> 56:09.480]  Go ahead.
[56:10.440 --> 56:12.620]  So you never eat the back of the ice cream.
[56:12.740 --> 56:14.780]  What do you mean? If you eat all of the ice cream...
[56:15.280 --> 56:16.520]  If you go lid up, you know how
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.520]  sometimes when you go lid up with your ice cream,
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.720]  I'm sure you've experienced this as ice cream
[56:20.720 --> 56:21.760]  basic people.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.760]  It gets icy. You get some ice in that ice cream.
[56:24.880 --> 56:26.580]  The liquid, the ice, the
[56:26.580 --> 56:27.900]  water, it gets in the bottom.
[56:28.380 --> 56:30.280]  You're leaving it in your freezer too long and your
[56:30.280 --> 56:31.340]  freezer's too cold.
[56:31.720 --> 56:34.700]  I don't know about freezers. I just know ice cream
[56:34.700 --> 56:36.660]  and I know if I put lid down, the ice
[56:36.660 --> 56:37.960]  cream never goes that way.
[56:38.020 --> 56:40.640]  So the water droplets seep
[56:40.640 --> 56:42.580]  upwards is what you're saying. So they would seep into
[56:42.580 --> 56:43.140]  the base.
[56:43.140 --> 56:45.360]  It's not a problem.
[56:45.500 --> 56:47.200]  You know, you might be onto
[56:47.200 --> 56:49.240]  something. I don't know about that. I just thought you
[56:49.240 --> 56:50.940]  wanted it to be closer to the lid, but
[56:50.940 --> 56:52.660]  my point was that it doesn't move.
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.240]  You avoid the ice thing. If you put
[56:55.240 --> 56:57.260]  the ice cream lid down, it's a
[56:57.260 --> 56:59.080]  thing. I do do that. You're upset
[56:59.080 --> 57:01.100]  that I don't put the ketchup down
[57:01.100 --> 57:03.200]  so I tell you I put the ice cream down and you're
[57:03.200 --> 57:04.660]  still mad at me. I can't win.
[57:05.080 --> 57:06.240]  Yeah, I'm kind of mad, yeah.
[57:10.140 --> 57:10.920]  Should I show
[57:10.920 --> 57:12.780]  Gavin my waffle, Geoff?
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.200]  That's the thing I think will make Gavin probably
[57:15.200 --> 57:17.060]  vomit. Yeah, show him your waffle.
[57:17.400 --> 57:19.040]  So, here's some good waffles,
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.080]  Gavin. These are like, I'm
[57:21.080 --> 57:23.000]  calling them a pawful because it's a pancake mix
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.880]  and a waffle maker, so it's not really a pancake,
[57:25.000 --> 57:26.960]  not really a waffle. That's the quality.
[57:27.400 --> 57:28.640]  Is that working out, by the way?
[57:28.780 --> 57:30.540]  Is this from the 70 pound bag?
[57:30.820 --> 57:32.700]  Yeah, that was a 70 pound cook.
[57:32.780 --> 57:34.640]  These are the pawfuls from the 70 pound.
[57:34.760 --> 57:36.800]  This is another one. Still figuring out
[57:36.800 --> 57:38.940]  the spread. Need a good spread
[57:38.940 --> 57:41.100]  on it. You're just not pouring enough
[57:41.100 --> 57:43.000]  mix in. Yeah, I need to get the
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.960]  spread right. I need more mix. I'm still finding
[57:44.960 --> 57:47.000]  that balance. You've got a solid urtle there, though.
[57:47.180 --> 57:48.780]  I do. It's a great urtle.
[57:49.280 --> 57:50.980]  Yeah, if you don't up your mix, you're never gonna get
[57:50.980 --> 57:52.600]  through the other 69 pounds.
[57:52.880 --> 57:54.940]  Even when they don't turn out well, though, your
[57:54.940 --> 57:56.980]  room smells so good. It is the
[57:56.980 --> 57:59.080]  greatest smell. It is a fantastic odor.
[58:00.260 --> 58:01.060]  But, yesterday,
[58:01.240 --> 58:02.680]  because the podcast came out,
[58:03.380 --> 58:04.860]  people learned about the waffle
[58:04.860 --> 58:07.380]  thing, I thought, I'm gonna make
[58:07.380 --> 58:09.460]  some waffles this morning, show
[58:09.460 --> 58:11.240]  the process. I recorded a little video
[58:11.240 --> 58:13.360]  for it. But, the waffle didn't
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.260]  quite turn out well, because I'm trying a new system.
[58:15.420 --> 58:17.360]  I'm putting the batter, or the mix, in a
[58:17.360 --> 58:19.400]  water bottle, and then I'm just pouring water into
[58:19.400 --> 58:21.420]  the bottle, then I'm shaking it. That's how I'm
[58:21.420 --> 58:23.300]  mixing it. And I'm still feeling it.
[58:23.400 --> 58:25.400]  I'm not measuring it yet. Like a shake and
[58:25.400 --> 58:27.560]  bake. Like a shake and bake type thing, yeah.
[58:27.980 --> 58:29.040]  But this was, uh,
[58:29.340 --> 58:30.980]  this is the waffle that came out
[58:31.580 --> 58:33.660]  yesterday. It was very wet,
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.500]  and it just didn't cook properly.
[58:36.560 --> 58:37.740]  It was not good.
[58:38.220 --> 58:39.560]  Seeing it next to the
[58:39.560 --> 58:41.580]  good ones makes it look even worse.
[58:42.100 --> 58:43.500]  Oh, yeah. It's a real
[58:43.500 --> 58:45.520]  disappointment. I can see the soggy
[58:45.520 --> 58:47.420]  It was
[58:47.420 --> 58:49.500]  undercooked. It looks like
[58:50.580 --> 58:51.700]  It looks like a waffle
[58:51.700 --> 58:53.600]  that fell in a pool, and someone fished it out.
[58:53.940 --> 58:55.620]  Oh, it's a wet waffle!
[58:56.080 --> 58:57.140]  It's a wet waffle.
[58:57.480 --> 58:59.680]  It was not cooked properly. I will
[58:59.680 --> 59:01.720]  say, though, it did not
[59:01.720 --> 59:02.920]  taste any better than it looks.
[59:03.960 --> 59:05.200]  It wasn't that bad.
[59:05.480 --> 59:06.620]  You got 70 pounds!
[59:07.200 --> 59:09.040]  Yeah, but I cooked it
[59:09.040 --> 59:10.420]  and I was like, well, I should try it.
[59:10.640 --> 59:13.020]  The real dilemma was that nose.
[59:13.120 --> 59:14.780]  You can kind of see it's a hard nose.
[59:14.900 --> 59:16.680]  There was a real bump in that nose. I was like,
[59:16.700 --> 59:18.980]  what's going on with this nose? I bit into it.
[59:19.060 --> 59:20.980]  Just powder. Just the powder that
[59:20.980 --> 59:22.740]  uncooked. It was just a chunk of powder
[59:22.740 --> 59:23.440]  in the nose.
[59:24.500 --> 59:26.660]  It was more like a crepe. It was sad.
[59:26.860 --> 59:28.760]  It was a sad thing. So wait, how was that
[59:28.760 --> 59:30.700]  because you're not meant to be pouring any powder
[59:30.700 --> 59:32.580]  into the actual waffle iron.
[59:32.680 --> 59:34.200]  He didn't mix it well enough.
[59:35.480 --> 59:36.940]  The shakage didn't.
[59:37.820 --> 59:38.940]  I've noticed the giant
[59:38.940 --> 59:41.040]  batter stain there on the table.
[59:41.300 --> 59:42.740]  Yeah, that was from that cook.
[59:43.440 --> 59:44.960]  There was a batter stain top left
[59:44.960 --> 59:46.400]  because it was a very liquidy.
[59:46.400 --> 59:48.340]  This is why it shouldn't be in the bedroom, Andrew.
[59:48.420 --> 59:50.540]  There's no dry wipe surfaces. This is like
[59:50.540 --> 59:52.400]  varnished wood. You're not meant to be
[59:52.400 --> 59:54.040]  putting waffle mix on it.
[59:54.280 --> 59:55.080]  I'm sure it's fine.
[59:56.360 --> 59:59.000]  You've got waffle stains next to your bedroom lamp.
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.300]  Yeah, it's a nice lamp.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.320]  I zoomed in. Don't do that.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.180]  It's glistening.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.660]  It looks wet.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.980]  It is glistening. It is very wet.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.980]  It needed more cook, but I'm also
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.080]  very paranoid because of the smoke alarm now
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.260]  about cooking stuff in here. It is a concern.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.280]  Yeah. Do you have one in your kitchen?
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.500]  No, I don't.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.280]  It's almost as though
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.120]  you should be doing it in there.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.160]  Maybe, but then I'd have to carry 70 pounds of batter
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.260]  back down the stairs, and I don't want to do that.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.280]  No, most people wouldn't store the batter
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.040]  in their bedroom.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.280]  You put it where the thing is, right?
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.640]  That's not illogical.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.380]  I feel like you could tackle that
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.260]  challenge and find a way to slide it
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.520]  downstairs in some overly complicated way
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.960]  that saves you from having to help.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.280]  You're right. I could literally just drop it from
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.060]  my balcony, and it would land on the balcony
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.560]  at that level. It wouldn't be that bad.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.360]  I've got to be honest as well. The hinge system
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.500]  on that waffle maker is driving me nuts.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:54.640]  What do you mean?
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.880]  It's asymmetrical. It's pissing me off.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.750]  It's a great waffle maker. How dare you?
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.200]  You take that back.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.080]  You take that back.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.300]  He's right. It's asymmetrical.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.680]  And there's an odd amount of space
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.400]  on the right one.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.580]  Would the bag explode if I dropped it
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.060]  one story onto another surface?
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:13.900]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.180]  Well, it depends on the bag. Is it just a clear bag?
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.500]  No, it's just a plastic bag.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.260]  It does have a seal.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.600]  It's not like a full zip.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.120]  Take your ripped up sheet
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.240]  that you ripped in half,
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.820]  cut it into strips, tie it, make it into a rope,
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.480]  lasso it around the
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.520]  bag, and then lower it down
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.560]  like Rapunzel. Make it dumb, will ya?
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.440]  Should I do that? Are we wrapping up?
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.180]  You want me to do that?
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.540]  You guys wrap up the show. I'm going to go lower
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.400]  the pancake. You've got some homework.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.620]  You've also got to take a picture of the
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.800]  bed situation
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.920]  at some point. Oh, you're right.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.040]  I should take a photo of it before I do it.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.960]  And there's stuff on the bed. I'm not going to do that.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.240]  I'll save it.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.740]  I'll try it. I'll do it later.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.880]  Alright, well thanks for
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.060]  listening to F*** Face.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.260]  Did we do an intro?
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.900]  Hello and welcome to episode...
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.720]  Yeah, we did. Did we?
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.940]  No, we didn't. Hello and welcome to
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.960]  episode four... fuck. Hello and
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.760]  welcome to episode 26 of F*** Face,
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.660]  a podcast about nothing.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.500]  Nick is saying we did.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.640]  Oh, we did. Undo it. Undo that.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.540]  How do you undo an intro?
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.660]  Please forget everything I just
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.440]  said. It no longer
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.480]  has relevance for the purposes
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.440]  of this podcast, which you have been listening
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.480]  to now for the last hour or so. Thank
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.720]  you so much. This has been another
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.780]  F*** Face production.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.300]  If you liked it, and I'm assuming
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.660]  you didn't, but maybe you did,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.300]  give us a like or
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.300]  a rate. People, we love
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.260]  those stars. Give us all five of them. We would
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.400]  appreciate it. I don't know where you do that, but the place
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.040]  that has stars. Go to the Star Store,
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.280]  buy us five. Do we have an Instagram, Geoff?
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.840]  Yeah, we do. We have an Instagram. Oh, wow.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.260]  And we got hats in that, although
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.420]  not yet. Do we? No, we don't have hats.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.300]  No, we won't have the hats until January.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.280]  Can we? Well, wait. Okay,
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.360]  so that was the whole thing. And I haven't responded
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.220]  yet. Can we pre-order sell
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.400]  the hats? No. No, pre-orders
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.300]  are a whole thing. It's, there's...
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.360]  Let me just,
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.300]  can I just say that my
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.280]  18 years of this
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.280]  industry and starting the Rooster Teeth
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.160]  store and running it for seven or eight years,
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.140]  pre-orders are
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.220]  a nightmare, logistically
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.100]  and legally, that you don't want to
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.540]  do if you go with it. Okay. Fascinating.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.340]  It just, it seemed like a great
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.020]  f*** face thing of the
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.360]  best Christmas gift the store has
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.240]  to offer doesn't arrive until
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.340]  after Christmas. But I think maybe we'll get
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.360]  the Ian shirt, so maybe we'll have that.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.360]  Where's the Ian shirt? I don't think I've even
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.460]  seen that. Uh, it's back
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.460]  a bit. It's just like a pocket tee with the Ian
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.340]  face. Yes, the Ian
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.380]  looking up face. Yeah. Oh, that's Ian?
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.200]  Yeah, that's Ian. That's his name.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.280]  Yeah. Oh, okay. I guess you
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.260]  weren't a part of that conversation. Where was I?
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.260]  Well, I don't think, I
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.840]  don't think you were on that text
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:04.100]  that Andrew and I had about it.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.380]  Oh, well. Did you want to
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.460]  be? I could... Here's what we're
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.000]  thinking, Gav. We're thinking about naming that
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.640]  character Ian. How do you feel about that?
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.020]  I think it's great. Alright.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.160]  And I'm telling you too,
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.080]  selling these bat knobs, I think it's
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.420]  a great plan. Nobody wants
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.340]  the knob. If we can sell, well
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.580]  listen, listen Gavin, I'll say this. It's a desk
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.100]  toy. If we can
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.540]  let's, let me sell the first
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.120]  however many bats we bought
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.300]  and if I can get through those and there's
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.460]  additional demand, then maybe we'll
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.260]  sell the knobs. But what if
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.400]  what if the demand for knobs is so much higher
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.080]  and people are holding out for knobs?
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.320]  It's just, okay, if people really want
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.380]  the knobs, they're getting the whole bat. What a
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.180]  savings we're bringing to them. We're
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.160]  selling the knobs, but you get a whole bunch of other
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.160]  wood too. What a fantastic deal.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400]  Yeah. I really want a product
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.120]  called the F*** Face Bat Knob.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.340]  I mean, I
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.300]  think we have one. I think it's gonna be
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.660]  sold at some point in the near future.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.440]  In the next six months, you will see
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.760]  a limited edition
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.860]  F*** Face Bat Knobs, as signed
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.660]  by Gavin Free.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.720]  Were you mad at me for pushing that you
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.560]  had to sign those? I hope you didn't mind.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.640]  I felt like I really... No, I was happy to do it.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.860]  I want it to feel like a special
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.640]  limited edition authenticated thing.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.820]  It's kind of the whole point of this.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.000]  Sure, of course.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.700]  I was happy to do it. I mean, I'm happy
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.780]  right now. We'll see how I feel 200 bats
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.780]  from now, but yeah. It's sort of funny that
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.760]  I lied and said that you tore
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.820]  your asshole and then I tore my asshole
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:34.180]  I'm here weeks later. That was foreshadowing.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.760]  That's what's called
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.060]  asshole karma. Yeah.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.720]  It really came back to bite me. You know who's not
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.080]  tearing their asshole, by the way?
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.660]  Dudes that use bidets. Can you delete that waffle?
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.600]  Probably could. Give me a second.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.700]  It's disgusting. Yeah, it's fine.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:48.760]  Thanks, man.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.660]  You posted it again.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.600]  Here, just let me push the waffle
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.820]  out because I don't want you to have to look
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.580]  at that one. I need all these. I need these
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.740]  saved for posterity because I have to
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.360]  get it up on the Instagram.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.940]  By the person that does that.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.300]  I'm back. I left.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.240]  Okay. I guess we should go, right?
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.720]  I'll be Eric.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:10.600]  Stop!
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.720]  Stop! You're too
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.700]  funny! You're too talented! You're being too
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.580]  entertaining! Knock it off!
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.640]  The podcast's over!
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.540]  What podcast is he yelling at in this context?
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.800]  Because it's not ours. That's Eric yelling
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.600]  at us for being too entertaining.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:26.740]  Bye.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:26.920]  Bye.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.240]  It's hard to end without Eric yelling at us.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:31.820]  Did it end?
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:32.960]  I don't know.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.400]  I hope you guys have a really nice
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.740]  rest of your day. And I'm excited to tell
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.800]  you guys about the second best license
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.060]  plate I've ever seen.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.680]  And the flat tire.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.100]  And about the flat tire saga.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.880]  The longest of the stories.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.440]  Yeah, we'll see.
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.240]  Tune in next time!
