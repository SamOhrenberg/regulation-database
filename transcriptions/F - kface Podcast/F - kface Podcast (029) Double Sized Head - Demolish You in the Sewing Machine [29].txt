[00:31.260 --> 00:33.560]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:45.630 --> 00:49.730]  I'm already ready to go. No, Andrew's still exporting. There's no way he's
[00:49.730 --> 00:54.810]  recording. You have to give him 25 minutes. You think that we've done how many of
[00:54.810 --> 00:59.370]  these? 28? You think I'm ready to go? Why are you never ready? Andrew's got to
[00:59.370 --> 01:03.210]  spin up the hamster wheel so he can save his fucking file. I'm doing the audio and
[01:03.210 --> 01:08.930]  W-A-V. Andrew's not ready. Eric's leaving. Maybe we should do it next week.
[01:09.610 --> 01:13.470]  I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Let's do a short one. Unless you've got somewhere to
[01:13.470 --> 01:20.510]  go, Gav. No, I've got nothing. Because I already blocked out the full allotted
[01:20.510 --> 01:26.070]  time, Eric. Yeah, well, next time I should do that. I'd like to point out...
[01:27.290 --> 01:30.610]  I'm going to assume we're going. Yeah, we've started like a minute ago. We've
[01:30.610 --> 01:34.150]  obviously started it. This is episode 29 of F*** Face. If you're tuning in, you
[01:34.150 --> 01:36.990]  don't know what the hell's going on. I think this episode started when Eric
[01:36.990 --> 01:42.770]  went, you can do another one, I guess. All right. Bye. This is the podcast that's
[01:42.770 --> 01:46.910]  produced by the very talented Eric Bador. And I say produced in light terms
[01:46.910 --> 01:51.670]  because he's only here about once every five episodes these days. I think that's
[01:51.670 --> 01:54.510]  what that's what that's where we're at right now. He's now accounting this when
[01:54.510 --> 01:58.130]  he's been here for one of the last five podcasts. He's definitely a guest on 27
[01:58.130 --> 02:03.230]  also. Oh, you're still here. Jesus. Yeah. Well, let's just how late can you go to
[02:03.230 --> 02:06.450]  this meeting? I'm I'm already 12 minutes late for this meeting.
[02:06.950 --> 02:13.070]  Well, what's another 42 minutes? That would be the whole meeting. So I have to go.
[02:13.470 --> 02:15.970]  But you haven't yet. You still you want to be in this episode.
[02:16.210 --> 02:21.250]  No, I want to. I need to go. But I'm Andrew. I'm waiting for Andrew to come back.
[02:21.550 --> 02:24.770]  So that way you guys have a third person. What's the meeting about?
[02:25.890 --> 02:29.910]  It's about new podcasts. Well, why don't you stick to the ones that we're still
[02:29.910 --> 02:34.030]  making? You're not even on them. I don't need to be on all of them. I just need to
[02:34.030 --> 02:38.130]  start getting these other ones going. What do you guys think Andrew's doing right now?
[02:38.670 --> 02:42.190]  He's probably managing the steam engine that's powering his computer.
[02:42.290 --> 02:45.090]  Yeah, he's cranking the generator. Yeah, the coal going in.
[02:45.290 --> 02:47.990]  OK, well, you guys talk amongst yourselves. I have to go to this meeting.
[02:49.370 --> 02:50.670]  OK. OK, bye.
[02:53.450 --> 02:58.330]  He's fucking gone. He's straight up gone. Just just the absentee producer.
[02:58.590 --> 03:01.730]  That's what we should credit him as. Geoff, were you more mad about the
[03:01.730 --> 03:05.870]  thing, or would you have been more mad if we'd done absolutely nothing and didn't make
[03:05.870 --> 03:12.850]  content from from that whole ordeal? Obviously, obviously, Gavin. Obviously,
[03:13.210 --> 03:18.670]  it's footage and that's all that matters. It's footage. It's footage. That's how we roll.
[03:19.130 --> 03:24.590]  That's how we live our lives. But it doesn't mean that it wasn't psychologically torturous
[03:24.590 --> 03:30.590]  for me, of course, for about two weeks. It was also followed up by Andrew seeming
[03:30.590 --> 03:35.090]  to have absolutely no understanding about how to make a bat because because we were talking about
[03:35.090 --> 03:38.070]  the bat knobs. If we want to sell smaller things and don't want to ship a full bat,
[03:38.130 --> 03:41.630]  we would just sell the knob because that's the signed bit. Yeah, but I don't know what he was
[03:41.630 --> 03:47.750]  so confused about. I was not confused. You two are ridiculous. Are you recording? Yeah, I'm recording.
[03:47.970 --> 03:52.190]  No, I just decided to talk. I've been here the whole time. It's just why would I talk if I'm not
[03:52.190 --> 03:58.750]  recording? What's the point? So now I'm talking. Why? You're ridiculous. Once again, my point was
[03:59.110 --> 04:03.630]  okay, so when you make a bat, you have a certain amount of material, right? Yeah. If you're just
[04:03.630 --> 04:07.710]  making knobs, how many knobs could you make with the same amount of material you would take to
[04:07.710 --> 04:11.510]  make a full bat? That's all I was saying. Well, obviously you would get a lot of knobs, but
[04:11.510 --> 04:16.210]  there's no one out there making just the knobs. That's not the question I was saying. That's not
[04:16.210 --> 04:22.130]  my point, though. I would also like to point out that you didn't ask it that coherently
[04:22.130 --> 04:28.750]  at any point. I feel like I did multiple times. Your summary now is approaching common sense.
[04:29.130 --> 04:33.450]  No, it was always common sense. It's approaching sensical, but you were nowhere near that
[04:33.450 --> 04:39.110]  success. No, I absolutely was. You two were just obsessed about making bats for some reason.
[04:39.510 --> 04:42.590]  You're both just saying nobody does that, and I'm like, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying how
[04:42.590 --> 04:46.530]  much could you make? You can make a lot of knobs for the amount of material you make one bat.
[04:46.530 --> 04:53.470]  But you'd have to custom get knobs, because no one mills a bat down to just the knob and
[04:53.470 --> 04:57.790]  puts it in a box ready. No one's going to buy that. But that's not what I'm saying. I'm not
[04:57.790 --> 05:02.910]  seeing people do this. I was just asking how many could you produce for the amount it would take to
[05:02.910 --> 05:06.830]  make one bat. You could probably make a bunch of knobs. That's all I was saying. But who's this
[05:06.830 --> 05:12.030]  person doing this? That's not the point. That's not the point. There doesn't need to be a person.
[05:12.030 --> 05:17.110]  This is a hypothetical how many knobs make a bat. It was hypothetical. Why are we talking about it
[05:17.110 --> 05:24.670]  then? What are you saying? What are you saying? I was just trying to make a point that for the
[05:24.670 --> 05:29.950]  amount you pay for one bat, if you were to sell knobs, you would get way more knobs for the same
[05:29.950 --> 05:34.630]  cost of material of one bat. But we're explaining this, and in the text you say that's crazy to me.
[05:34.710 --> 05:38.690]  A knob is a knob. Well, because you guys went this whole other way. I don't have it in front
[05:38.690 --> 05:44.470]  of me. I'm sure I could explain why it was crazy. You guys seem to imply that you can only have a
[05:44.470 --> 05:50.030]  knob if you made a bat. That the knob could not exist without being connected to the bat. That was
[05:50.030 --> 05:53.030]  the implication I was getting. Well, we were talking about a real product. We were saying
[05:53.030 --> 05:59.830]  it's going to be cheaper and easier to buy a load of bats and saw off the knobs than get custom knobs
[05:59.830 --> 06:04.690]  built. I was just saying, hypothetically, if you were to only make knobs, it would be more cost
[06:04.690 --> 06:08.410]  effective. Because you could make way more of them for the same amount of resources you would
[06:08.410 --> 06:13.950]  need to make a full bat. At no point did you make that point, that clearly. That was the entirety of
[06:13.950 --> 06:17.430]  my point. That's nonsense. That's absolutely nonsense. No, absolutely not. I'll be honest with
[06:17.430 --> 06:23.050]  you. Anytime anybody mentions bat or knob, my fucking, the hairs on the back of my neck stand
[06:23.050 --> 06:29.570]  up, so I'm on edge immediately. So it's possible I was a little, I was a little on guard from the
[06:29.570 --> 06:34.670]  outset of that conversation, but if memory serves, and it usually does, Gavin is right, you were
[06:34.690 --> 06:39.270]  being a bit of a lunatic and not making any sense. No, I wasn't. I was being... Look at this little
[06:39.270 --> 06:46.370]  section of the conversation. Andrew says, you couldn't just make a knob bat. I said, what does
[06:46.370 --> 06:52.290]  that mean? Geoff says, no dude, a bat has one knob on it. To get more knobs from a length of bat,
[06:52.350 --> 06:57.490]  you need to get the wood before they lathed it, blah blah. Andrew said, well, it's just shaped
[06:57.490 --> 07:03.810]  wood, isn't it? Wait, so they attach the knob? I said, no, oh my god. Honestly, this conversation
[07:03.810 --> 07:10.350]  is pages long, and it doesn't align with anything that you just said, Andrew. No, my whole point,
[07:11.510 --> 07:15.810]  no, is that a text conversation? We have so many conversations in different places. Okay.
[07:16.310 --> 07:21.470]  I don't even have my phone on me. That was my point the entire time, was that the amount of
[07:21.470 --> 07:25.590]  knobs you can make with the same resources you make with a bat would be a lot more. So in my
[07:25.590 --> 07:29.470]  head, it's more cost effective to make knobs because you can make more of them. Instead of
[07:29.470 --> 07:33.610]  just selling one bat, you can make however many knobs with that same amount of material.
[07:33.990 --> 07:37.190]  That was my point. Then you guys were talking about, like, bats need knobs,
[07:37.570 --> 07:41.770]  and you made it sound like knobs couldn't be adjacent from the bat. And then I was talking
[07:41.770 --> 07:45.570]  about, like, what if you just did a bat of knobs? Like, what if it was just knobs the whole way?
[07:45.630 --> 07:50.210]  Why couldn't it just be all knobs? And you're very opposed to that, from my memory. No,
[07:51.250 --> 07:57.590]  wait, how was I opposed? I feel like somebody, maybe it was Geoff, but people were not supportive
[07:57.590 --> 08:04.510]  of that idea. You just have a knob of bats. Or a knob bat? A knob of bats? A bat of knobs? A bat
[08:04.510 --> 08:08.790]  of knobs. Yeah, that'd be the better way to say it. It's ludicrous. Just ludicrous. I think it'd
[08:08.790 --> 08:13.250]  be fun. I still think there's a market there for the bat knobs. We just have to make the knobs.
[08:13.590 --> 08:19.230]  Yeah. We just have to get the knobs made. Listen, I'm not opposed to it. If we do it, I'd like them
[08:19.230 --> 08:25.190]  to be full-size knobs. I'd like them to be... I don't want to sell toy bat knobs. I'd like to sell
[08:25.190 --> 08:35.350]  full-size baseball bat knobs. And if we can get them that size, I would... if I can burn them again
[08:35.350 --> 08:41.090]  or whatever, eventually. Or we can come up with something else to do that one of you two could do
[08:41.090 --> 08:44.850]  that would be cool. I think it's really good when you do it. I think people really like that. I
[08:44.850 --> 08:48.550]  think that's the feedback we're going to get is we specifically really like when Geoff signs the
[08:48.550 --> 08:52.490]  small knobs. Well, the one thing that I'll say is if it was a full-size knob, it would probably be
[08:52.490 --> 08:57.630]  a hell of a lot easier. A hell of a lot easier to number. Also, if we sawed off the main part
[08:57.630 --> 09:01.910]  of the bat, then that bat... that wood is then clean for engraving. Yeah, that's true. What do you mean?
[09:02.470 --> 09:07.410]  That's no varnish. Oh yeah, that's a great point. Yeah, fuck that varnish, let me tell you.
[09:07.690 --> 09:12.710]  Well, that is the question. Was the varnish part of the bat or were they manipulated? I don't think
[09:12.710 --> 09:16.390]  we'll ever know. I think we still don't know. Yeah. And the one man who could tell us is left.
[09:17.690 --> 09:24.810]  He's derelict in his duty again. Ay-yi-yi. Fucking... and then, so I was thinking about like what's next
[09:25.310 --> 09:31.210]  and then actually my girlfriend said, what if you get... what if you should make a zine
[09:31.730 --> 09:36.090]  about Andrew? And I thought that's a great idea actually because Andrew says a lot of dumb
[09:36.090 --> 09:40.550]  off-the-wall stuff and I thought we could just make a zine about Andrew or a f***face zine.
[09:40.990 --> 09:46.210]  That would be a lot of fun to do. Dude, don't start. And then I put it in the merch. I said,
[09:46.210 --> 09:50.410]  hey, I want to make a zine. And then like a year later when Andrew got his phone back,
[09:51.170 --> 09:55.230]  he just out of the blue said, what's a zine? And then I was like, A, how do you not know what
[09:55.230 --> 09:59.230]  a zine is? But I thought, what do you think a zine is? And then it turned into the most
[09:59.230 --> 10:04.630]  frustrating conversation. The closest I think Andrew got was he said, uh, is it a hat? No.
[10:05.450 --> 10:13.450]  No, I didn't. No, I didn't. No, you're... what a twist of words. I compared it to a magazine. I
[10:13.450 --> 10:17.470]  said, is it a magazine? Is a part of the magazine? I didn't know what it was. I had no context for
[10:17.470 --> 10:24.330]  it. I, my point was, if someone has no idea what it is asking, what do you think it is? What's
[10:24.330 --> 10:29.110]  the value in that conversation? Are you having someone, are you paying someone to be you on
[10:29.110 --> 10:35.310]  Slack? Because you on Slack and you never agree. I don't know what that means. I will go to the
[10:35.310 --> 10:41.810]  Slack log right now. I definitely thought it was a magazine. I, well, I said, is a zine a hat as
[10:41.810 --> 10:46.810]  a joke? Because it was a reference to... Yeah, that was the point of that. I didn't actually
[10:46.810 --> 10:53.450]  think a zine was a hat. And then I say, magazine related. That's my first real guess. I wasn't all
[10:53.450 --> 10:58.230]  about this hat. But then it turned into a whole, well, what is a zine then? No, then it, then you
[10:58.230 --> 11:03.330]  want to know what a maga is. Well, because it's tied to the zine. And then you want to know what
[11:03.330 --> 11:09.130]  an iam is. Well, that was a conversation I had with someone. I, I do a quiz thing with, with a friend.
[11:09.130 --> 11:15.050]  And one of the questions was, what do you put in a terrarium? And I narrowed it down to either
[11:15.050 --> 11:21.490]  tomatoes or turtles. It was one of the two. And I thought, okay, well, if a turtle is in a terrarium,
[11:21.550 --> 11:26.950]  you put fish in an aquarium, both have iams. Is there an iam connection? What is the joint iam?
[11:27.290 --> 11:30.790]  I went tomatoes, even though I know how you grow tomatoes and there's no terrarium involved,
[11:30.830 --> 11:34.710]  it was a terrible guess. Obviously wrong. So I was just wondering what the iams were.
[11:34.710 --> 11:39.710]  It's like a, just a Latin ending, isn't it? It is. It's, uh, and I answered that in the...
[11:39.710 --> 11:43.310]  Yeah, you did. You explained all of it. Here's the conversation. Andrew says,
[11:44.030 --> 11:50.130]  what's a zine? Uh, Andrew says, what's a zine? I, I say, uh, what do you think it is? Andrew responds,
[11:50.330 --> 11:56.430]  that's an insane response. Eric says, this is very good. No, I don't think it's an insane response.
[11:56.710 --> 11:59.910]  I think it's interesting. If you don't know what something is, I'd just like to know what your first
[11:59.910 --> 12:04.550]  guess is. I say, no, I think it's a fair response. Happy to answer you, but I'd love to know your
[12:04.550 --> 12:09.710]  initial thoughts before it's tainted with actual information. You said, that would be like if we
[12:09.710 --> 12:15.350]  took a random person and said, what's Gerpol? To which I responded, I don't know, I don't think
[12:15.350 --> 12:20.910]  that's a bad idea. I think we could do that. And you said, a zine certainly isn't a hat. I say,
[12:21.130 --> 12:27.010]  okay. You respond, is a zine a hat? I believe you thought a zine was a hat. No, I never did. It was
[12:27.010 --> 12:33.710]  a joke. This is a joke, Geoff. Okay. I still think we should make a zine. I still don't, you explain
[12:33.710 --> 12:38.450]  to me what it is, I don't understand what you mean. I sent you Wikipedia articles. No, I know what it is,
[12:38.510 --> 12:42.550]  I just don't understand how it would be executed. I don't know what you want from it. I would, I would,
[12:42.630 --> 12:48.190]  I would, here's what, here's how it would be. I would make a face zine or an Andrew zine. I would,
[12:48.790 --> 12:53.270]  either way, I'm giving you the foreword to it, the intro. You would write a page of something
[12:53.270 --> 12:59.510]  about what this is, episode one. Uh, then, uh, Gavin would, we would give some, some tips on
[12:59.510 --> 13:03.710]  how to live your life. Like, uh, how to store your ketchup. Here's a helpful guide, how to
[13:03.710 --> 13:08.010]  store your ketchup. We'd write it all out, make some funny, some funny stuff there. Gavin would,
[13:08.050 --> 13:12.110]  uh, illustrate it because he's obviously the talented artist among the three of us based on,
[13:12.130 --> 13:16.050]  uh, his... Well, ever since Andrew taught me how to draw... Yeah, ever since Andrew told you how
[13:16.050 --> 13:20.790]  to draw, we could have, uh, like a little game, like how to draw a face. We could do that a little
[13:20.790 --> 13:27.530]  bit. Maybe have an article, uh, on, uh, I don't know, how to make a, how to make a hot dog in your
[13:27.530 --> 13:31.650]  closet. Sounds like a nice beefed up version of our Instagram. Yeah, like a little beefed up,
[13:31.650 --> 13:36.570]  beefed up version, and then you add some pictures and stuff, and then you photocopy it, and staple
[13:36.570 --> 13:43.190]  it, and fold it in half, and then sell it. I understood. Got it. That makes sense. That sounds
[13:43.190 --> 13:48.550]  good. I can support that. I think it would be a fun one-time thing, a unique thing to do, like
[13:48.550 --> 13:54.250]  the bats, and I'm sure, now that I've breathed that idea into the world, uh, it will come back
[13:54.250 --> 13:58.590]  to torture and torment me in some way. No, not at all. In the back of the first issue, we should
[13:58.590 --> 14:02.790]  have, like, a dotted outline where you can cut it out and construct your own hat from the zine,
[14:02.910 --> 14:08.410]  so that technically a zine is a hat. That's a great idea. Could I sponsor the zine? Is the
[14:08.410 --> 14:13.570]  zine looking for sponsors for, for the publication of it? Yeah, if you want to sponsor it with, like,
[14:13.690 --> 14:16.550]  Not the Rooster Teeth Store. As the owner of Not the Rooster Teeth Store, I'd be willing to maybe
[14:16.550 --> 14:21.470]  kick some money your way, get a good ad for it, because it is the Christmas season. I would give
[14:21.470 --> 14:26.470]  you preferred ad placement. That's great. And then we could sell it on your website where it arrives
[14:26.470 --> 14:31.690]  a year and a half from now. Yeah, exactly. This is all coming together perfectly. I have multiple
[14:31.690 --> 14:37.050]  businesses now. Thank me later. Building a little empire here. Yeah, but let me, you know what, this
[14:37.050 --> 14:41.950]  is actually a great time, uh, because I'm assuming, uh, the, uh, well, I'm not assuming anything,
[14:41.950 --> 14:46.810]  because this is my idea, and I'm not at all being influenced by what I assume was successful and was
[14:46.810 --> 14:51.230]  a really good idea by someone else. I just came up with this myself. Not the Rooster Teeth Store,
[14:51.230 --> 14:55.330]  Christmas, coming around the corner, might want to get a gift. I figured, what would be better
[14:55.330 --> 15:01.710]  than a bat? So, I put some work in, I really put the time and effort in, and, uh, we're gonna have
[15:01.710 --> 15:07.190]  bats on the store. Wait. What? We're gonna have some bats. Aw, he's made a, he's made a fluke-faced bat.
[15:07.330 --> 15:12.350]  No, it's a totally original idea, not related to anyone else, completely influenced by me. It was
[15:12.350 --> 15:17.190]  my thought. I like bats a lot. Big fan of knobs. Like all of it. Think it's a great thing. So I
[15:17.190 --> 15:22.690]  made some bats. What logo? Whose logo is that on the side? That's the fluke-face logo. That is
[15:22.690 --> 15:26.530]  the official fluke-face logo. No, the other one. Which, oh, that's the company that made the bat.
[15:26.890 --> 15:32.550]  Couldn't remove that. That's theirs. No, didn't have that option. It's a great looking bat.
[15:33.190 --> 15:36.950]  Fluke-face. What size, what size is this bat? It looks like a real-sized, looks like a normal-sized bat.
[15:36.950 --> 15:40.610]  I don't think it's, I think it's, it's either gonna be a normal, nah, I think it's a trophy bat,
[15:41.070 --> 15:45.810]  but just, uh, putting it out there. Not theroosterteethstore.com. Fluke-face bats.
[15:45.810 --> 15:53.730]  It's mainly someone else's logo on a bat, Andrew. Nah, it's maybe 50-50 at best. At best, Gavin,
[15:53.830 --> 15:58.370]  50-50. It's a pretty good bat. I don't, I don't think that bat's as good as the other bat.
[15:58.690 --> 16:04.270]  I think it's a pretty good bat. Got it engraved on the side. Because I like minimal effort,
[16:04.350 --> 16:08.170]  unlike Geoff. I don't, I like to put nothing into the project, so I just had them do it.
[16:08.470 --> 16:14.830]  There's also only going to be one of these, so. Stock a little limited, not that we sell things
[16:14.830 --> 16:21.750]  anyway, but it's going to be a tough guess. Just engrave one on it. Yeah, just one of one. So
[16:21.750 --> 16:27.670]  Fluke-face has a bat. And do you think that'll ship before Christmas? Uh, definitely not. That,
[16:27.950 --> 16:32.270]  we, we run our shipping through a company called Thank Me Later, unrelated, I'm not double dipping
[16:32.270 --> 16:40.830]  at all. So somewhere between four to 12 months is my understanding. I may be looking into cricket
[16:40.830 --> 16:45.170]  bats and ping pong paddles. Who knows? Maybe this is a whole market. We'll see. We'll see what the
[16:45.170 --> 16:49.930]  future has to hold. I can't wait to see your rip off zine you make. I don't know what that is,
[16:49.950 --> 16:58.650]  so don't worry about it. Just don't put a hat store. I actually got feedback from somebody
[16:58.650 --> 17:04.350]  who, there are hats in the wild now by people. And I got feedback from someone who I sent through
[17:04.350 --> 17:08.990]  one of the charity things. And they're messed up in a way that we didn't even understand. Like,
[17:08.990 --> 17:14.630]  the layers of how fucked up these hats are is still unfolding. Are you serious? Yeah,
[17:14.750 --> 17:20.670]  the person said they were going to send a photo of them wearing it to the Instagram account. But
[17:20.670 --> 17:25.250]  when they put it on, it's like, it's not deep enough to wear properly. It like doesn't fit
[17:25.250 --> 17:29.750]  on their head. Like the depth of the hat, it doesn't line up. So it's not even like a good
[17:29.750 --> 17:35.210]  thing to wear. And they're short. They were like four foot something. And so the logo being at the
[17:35.710 --> 17:40.630]  remember like the fuck across is way too high. They were optimal for that. And it still just
[17:40.630 --> 17:45.230]  doesn't work. There's no scenario in which that hat works. Wait, what's their height got to do
[17:45.230 --> 17:50.730]  with it? Well, cause we were joking that the logo on the hat, like it goes up. Like it's on the top.
[17:51.030 --> 17:54.870]  So if you're short, people could look down and see the logo. Sorry, I thought you were saying
[17:54.870 --> 17:58.950]  that the depth of the hat was to do with how short they are. Like they have a shorter head.
[17:59.270 --> 18:02.790]  No, no. It had nothing to do with that. I was just saying that it was an additional way in
[18:02.790 --> 18:07.750]  which the hats were screwed up. So it's like a skull. It's like a scalp covering. It apparently
[18:07.750 --> 18:11.950]  is. Yeah. I haven't tried to wear one. My head is certainly big anyway. It wouldn't work no matter
[18:11.950 --> 18:21.870]  what. But it apparently doesn't for even a normal head. Large head, long back. Bad ankles. Yeah,
[18:22.010 --> 18:27.330]  it's like my body type would be like if you squeeze the thing of toothpaste, like it's not
[18:27.330 --> 18:37.860]  a lot at the bottom. And then there's we're going really big top. Do you own do you? Can you wear
[18:37.860 --> 18:44.180]  hats? No, I can't. I don't have any. I buy I've bought a few hats. There's no hat that fits me.
[18:44.440 --> 18:49.320]  It sucks. I'd love to be a hat guy. A beanie will fit you. No, I can't wear a beanie. I don't look
[18:49.320 --> 18:54.500]  good in a beanie. Beanie is no good for me. I'd love to be a hat guy. It just doesn't work. In a
[18:54.500 --> 19:01.720]  perfect world, if we could find if we could identify and find the right size, what kind of
[19:01.720 --> 19:06.700]  hat do you see yourself wearing? Do you mean like are you thinking like a baseball cap or like a top
[19:06.700 --> 19:13.040]  hat? Yeah, no, I don't want a top hat. I just want a baseball hat. I'm not asking for a lot. I'd love
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.260]  to be a baseball hat guy. You don't do like a Sherlock Holmes hat or maybe like a pork pie hat
[19:17.260 --> 19:22.240]  like you're in a ska band. That seems hot. Yeah, you just want to just a regular old baseball hat,
[19:22.240 --> 19:27.260]  but one that fits a giant, giant head. Yeah, it's been a real problem. I'm sure that that
[19:27.260 --> 19:33.500]  company exists. We used to work with a guy, uh, Gav, you remember him? Bernie? Uh, he had a giant
[19:33.500 --> 19:38.340]  head and I think he had a special, he had to special order his baseball caps from a, like a
[19:38.340 --> 19:48.320]  big and tall head store, right? I'm not making that up. I didn't mention it. But I've never understood
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.520]  when people say like, people say, are you, I've got a big head. It's only a head can only be so
[19:53.520 --> 19:59.640]  big. I would say that. No, no. Next time we're in Austin and you're done laughing at my broken ankle,
[19:59.860 --> 20:03.760]  you're going to look at my head and be like, that's a big head. Well, I have photos of you
[20:03.760 --> 20:09.680]  that I've taken with other people in them and your head is just, it's not, it matches. No,
[20:10.100 --> 20:15.500]  no. I'm telling if next time, next time we're in the same location together, you'll do an analysis.
[20:15.500 --> 20:19.480]  He'll be like, that's a big head. I think we got to measure head. I think we got to measure
[20:19.480 --> 20:24.220]  head size. I will absolutely measure. I bet you my head is almost double the size of Gavin's head.
[20:24.540 --> 20:30.040]  That's impossible. Double. I got a double head on Gavin. Well, wait, how big, you've got a tiny
[20:30.040 --> 20:36.940]  smushed in nose that can't be broken. Mine sticks out like half the length of my head. That has
[20:36.940 --> 20:41.100]  nothing to do with head size. That's no size. That's a different thing. That's on my head.
[20:41.340 --> 20:44.900]  What do you think the nose is? No, but it's part of the head, but it's not like you don't wear a
[20:44.900 --> 20:49.920]  on your nose. It doesn't matter how big your nose is. You don't wear a hat on your nose.
[20:49.920 --> 20:50.920]  One of those plague doctors.
[20:53.580 --> 20:59.600]  Should we do moulds? Should we do casts of our heads? Yes. How do we do that? It's a process,
[20:59.780 --> 21:04.420]  but we could get them done and then we could maybe have paperweights. And if you have like
[21:04.420 --> 21:08.660]  really, if you live in a really windy place with a lot of paper, that's when you buy the Andrew one
[21:08.660 --> 21:14.080]  because it's apparently so much bigger. I don't think my head could fit on my desk. I don't think
[21:14.080 --> 21:19.440]  I have space for it. I'm not saying my head is bigger than my desk. I'm saying for the amount
[21:19.440 --> 21:23.820]  of space I have on my desk, it would not fit. I'd have to move things. Yeah, you'd move the
[21:23.820 --> 21:31.440]  waffle maker, the condiments. That's near my bed. Relax. Have you made a bed waffle yet? Have either
[21:31.440 --> 21:36.460]  of you done that? You said you're going to do it. No, I just... Disappoint. No, I haven't received
[21:36.460 --> 21:41.420]  my waffle maker yet. You bought one? Well, I don't want to say. I don't want to talk about it.
[21:41.420 --> 21:48.380]  Okay. Well, you just did. So it's too late. I don't currently have a bedroom waffle maker.
[21:48.660 --> 21:53.900]  Okay. I'll say that. And I'll be able to talk about it more early next year, probably.
[21:54.600 --> 22:00.420]  What? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a whole thing. Speaking of making molds of our head,
[22:00.520 --> 22:05.440]  that reminded me, I recently heard a story on... fuck, it was probably another podcast, honestly,
[22:05.540 --> 22:10.620]  so I'm probably poaching somebody else's content. But did you ever hear that story about
[22:10.620 --> 22:19.480]  Geoff Daniels and his plaster face mask on SNL? No. No. He apparently was... this is a long time
[22:19.480 --> 22:26.520]  ago. He was doing an episode of SNL he was hosting, and they put like a plaster... get like
[22:26.520 --> 22:32.140]  a plaster mold of his face. And the only thing... I hope I'm not fucking this story up. I'm going
[22:32.140 --> 22:36.280]  off memory. It was like his face was totally covered except for two little nose holes.
[22:36.860 --> 22:43.920]  And they went to take the plaster off, and it wouldn't come off. And it was like rock hard,
[22:44.100 --> 22:49.680]  and they couldn't figure out how to get it off. And I think that like his mouth was covered too,
[22:49.840 --> 22:55.980]  and he wasn't feeling well. And he was like... they were terrified because if he vomited or
[22:55.980 --> 23:02.460]  he would choke and die. And they were trying to figure out how to get it off. And I think
[23:02.460 --> 23:08.060]  eventually they got it off after hours and hours. They had to take it off with a hammer,
[23:08.620 --> 23:13.280]  and I think he lost... I think he lost his eyebrows, and his eyelashes, and some of his other
[23:13.280 --> 23:19.400]  hair. And then they found out... I'm looking up a story about it now. It says they took six hours,
[23:19.540 --> 23:25.480]  and by one in the morning he was ready to go. But he held down the vomit from his jambalaya
[23:25.480 --> 23:30.880]  that he had because he was gonna die. They ripped out all the stubble in his beard. It was like
[23:31.240 --> 23:35.540]  painful. And then they got it off. And then they found out later, I think... and this part I might
[23:35.540 --> 23:38.580]  be making up, but I don't think so. I think they found out later that somebody in the costume
[23:38.580 --> 23:46.420]  department was disgruntled or got laid off and tampered with that mold. Like the bats. Yeah.
[23:46.800 --> 23:50.900]  And supposedly Geoff Daniels, he was sick to his stomach the whole time because he had some bad
[23:50.900 --> 23:55.220]  food. And if he had vomited while he was wearing that thing that they couldn't get off, he would
[23:55.220 --> 24:00.320]  have died. And it took like six hours to get off. I wonder if the vomit would have blown it off.
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.240]  I don't know, dude. I think that would... I think... I don't know about you guys,
[24:05.360 --> 24:10.280]  but I think if I was trapped with only my nose holes out for that long while they couldn't get
[24:10.280 --> 24:15.560]  something off my face and it was probably pitch black and, you know, I couldn't... I couldn't
[24:15.560 --> 24:18.880]  breathe. I couldn't open my mouth or anything. I think I'd probably would lose... I think I'd
[24:18.880 --> 24:23.000]  probably lose my mind. I think that would break me. I think I'd probably just die.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.620]  I've had that done. I've had the thing where you just have like straws in your nose and that's
[24:27.620 --> 24:33.180]  the only thing that you can do because your mouth is snugly covered. Yeah, it's it's not great.
[24:33.640 --> 24:40.560]  It's not a relaxing experience when you're not about to hurl. Yeah, no, I... I don't... I hope
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.900]  I don't ever have to do that. I'm not scared of like enclosed spaces or anything, but I think that
[24:44.900 --> 24:48.880]  would fuck me up. Didn't we just have a conversation about molding our entire faces?
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.980]  Wasn't that the lead into this? I hope I hope I hope I never have to do this. We're literally
[24:54.980 --> 24:59.700]  we're talking about doing this. I mean, I'll do it for my skull. I'll do my cranium. I just
[24:59.700 --> 25:04.040]  don't want to do my mouth and my nose. What do you mean? You could do the whole thing. All right,
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.380]  I'll do the whole thing, but nobody can tamper with the solution and we have to make sure that
[25:08.380 --> 25:14.160]  it's not it hasn't like Nick isn't disgruntled or something. As the people who make f*** face,
[25:14.260 --> 25:18.840]  we should have a code word where this shouldn't be mentioned on the podcast either. We'll have
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.680]  it privately, but where we want to just not mess with each other for the duration of a project.
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.580]  And if we all say the code word, then we just make a gentleman's agreement that we will not
[25:28.580 --> 25:33.840]  mess with said discussion. I would never do something that would that would like to that
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.540]  level. That'd be terrible. I'm OK with with jokes, a little bit of a mental manipulation
[25:39.540 --> 25:43.780]  for for a good laugh. Nobody gets hurt as long as nobody really gets hurt. We're good.
[25:44.180 --> 25:50.100]  But I wouldn't do that. I'm not trapping anybody. This episode is brought to you by Dogfish Head

[27:31.280 --> 27:39.740]  of Rooster Teeth. One could say that I'm a professional genital discusser, in some circles
[27:39.740 --> 27:48.520]  and I can tell you, from getting jalapeno juice on my balls to using a straight razor,
[27:48.740 --> 27:55.660]  I've punished them. Manscaped is here to take some of that punishment away. What a weird thing to
[27:55.660 --> 28:01.440]  say. The point is, it's a good product. I'll say that. And your balls and your dick are sensitive
[28:02.080 --> 28:07.560]  and you don't want to... this is not where you want to screw around. You want to use the good

[29:15.520 --> 29:21.980]  you're with them 24 hours a day, but your feet stink. They always do. And if you're wearing
[29:21.980 --> 29:27.900]  Birkenstocks or Tevas or any open-toed anything, I can smell them. We all can. So do us a favor.

[30:15.740 --> 30:20.740]  Look who's back. No. Is it Eric? I have a question. I'm back, baby.
[30:21.460 --> 30:26.580]  I'm glad Eric is here. How'd the meeting go? It was good. It was productive. I think we're
[30:26.580 --> 30:31.840]  going to have a new slate of some stuff coming in January and into February. I'm really excited
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.000]  about the new products and the new shows that we're putting out for Rooster Teeth and roosterteeth.com,
[30:36.080 --> 30:39.760]  the Rooster Teeth phone application. Eric, would you get a mold of your head done?
[30:40.200 --> 30:45.080]  Oh, that would be cool. Yeah. How would you do that? We didn't get that far. We're just discussing
[30:45.080 --> 30:49.700]  molds. We're trying to decide. We want to get molds of our heads so we can see if Andrew's
[30:49.700 --> 30:55.460]  is twice the size of Gavin's. Andrew said, get this, his head is twice the size of mine.
[30:56.620 --> 31:02.560]  I have a huge head. Can't you just measure hat size? We could, but I think it just escalated
[31:02.560 --> 31:07.220]  to doing a full mold. They wanted to go the extra mile. Eric, you and I listen to a lot of the same
[31:07.220 --> 31:12.820]  podcasts. Did you recently hear a story about Geoff Daniels being stuck in a mold on SNL from
[31:12.820 --> 31:16.840]  one of the podcasts we both listened to together? What? No, I haven't heard that yet. I don't know
[31:16.840 --> 31:22.660]  I heard it from them. How do you get stuck in a mold? Well, I'll tell you what, you should listen
[31:22.660 --> 31:28.680]  to this episode of F***face because we already covered it. Or just come, just be here, you know,
[31:28.760 --> 31:35.440]  to produce. I found a thing on how to make head molds. Oh, that seems easy. Yeah, I'm a producer.
[31:36.660 --> 31:42.120]  You didn't produce anything, you googled something. I found solutions for what you can do
[31:42.120 --> 31:46.460]  if you want to get a mold of your head. The thing that you didn't have a solution for. So if you
[31:46.460 --> 31:50.500]  have any more questions, let me know. I just don't want to, I just don't want to throw up and die.
[31:50.740 --> 31:55.640]  No, that'd be terrible. I have a question. I've asked this to a few people. There's no range.
[31:55.740 --> 31:59.440]  Either people don't know this. I was in the camp that didn't know this. And then there are people
[31:59.440 --> 32:03.140]  that do. And the people that do seem to think you're the dumbest person in the world for not
[32:03.140 --> 32:08.280]  knowing this. How do you differentiate what are your teen years? Do you know this? Without saying,
[32:08.280 --> 32:13.040]  You both know this, Geoff and Gavin? Do I know? If it ends in the word,
[32:14.600 --> 32:21.660]  it's a teen year. Okay. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Yeah, because of teen. It says teen in the name.
[32:21.960 --> 32:27.120]  19. Eric, did you know that? Yeah, I don't understand. I mean, I feel like you're gonna
[32:27.120 --> 32:30.380]  trick us or something. And you're gonna be like, it actually extends to 22. Yeah.
[32:31.840 --> 32:37.200]  It's just like the teen. If you consider like 12 your teens, but it's not. It's 13 through 19.
[32:38.100 --> 32:43.840]  I've asked this. I've gotten equal didn't know and know. I didn't know that. I had no idea. There
[32:43.840 --> 32:48.360]  was a whole thing. I didn't know where my teen years began and ended. I was unsure if I was a
[32:48.360 --> 32:54.100]  teenager when I was like 17. Maybe it's different in Canada. Teenage. It's all in the word. Teen.
[32:54.420 --> 33:00.080]  I know. I just never made the connection. I never thought about it. Okay, let's follow the line
[33:00.080 --> 33:06.040]  then. Do you know what dictates when you're in your 20s? Well, you're in your 20s. Oh,
[33:06.040 --> 33:13.020]  it's the word thing again? 21. How about 30s? I always view it as a number thing. I don't view
[33:13.020 --> 33:21.780]  it as a word thing. The word is a number. No, no, no, no, no. You're making a terrible point
[33:21.780 --> 33:30.100]  because when you're a kid, you're a kid or you're a child. It's not a child to a child to set child
[33:30.660 --> 33:40.640]  and it doesn't apply the same way. No, shut up. You think that the one situation negates the rest
[33:40.640 --> 33:46.380]  of ages. You think because child doesn't have a number associated with it. You don't. 10, 20,
[33:46.680 --> 33:52.620]  30, 40. You think all of those are negated. You don't do it with child or adult. You only do it
[33:52.620 --> 33:56.880]  with teen. So it's kind of weird. It just is a thing that comes in the middle. It's the numbers.
[33:57.380 --> 34:01.880]  It's just the numbers. I get it's the numbers when I'm saying it's a weird operating system
[34:01.880 --> 34:07.060]  because it applies. It's like almost a convenience thing. I don't feel like... it's just strange.
[34:07.140 --> 34:11.560]  That's why I never thought about it because I wasn't... there's no number thing from 1 to 11.
[34:12.040 --> 34:14.980]  What's a 12? 12. 1 to 12. Yeah, 13.
[34:17.460 --> 34:21.840]  And then there's nothing for adult going above that. So it's just sort of this weird thing of
[34:21.840 --> 34:28.260]  time. You flip the 20s, 30s. That's a thing. But like kid, adult or child, teenager, adult.
[34:28.820 --> 34:32.000]  What do you mean there's nothing above it? No, they're two different systems, aren't they?
[34:32.540 --> 34:36.160]  When you're in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 10s. Well, 10s wouldn't work.
[34:37.420 --> 34:42.160]  Senior, middle aged. Yeah, but those are like all terms. Teen
[34:42.160 --> 34:45.740]  is part of those terms and it's the only one that has numbers tied to it for the
[34:45.740 --> 34:48.480]  pronunciation of the numbers. That is not incorrect.
[34:52.740 --> 34:58.040]  It's not. I don't even know how to respond to that.
[34:58.440 --> 35:02.740]  I joined this podcast and I feel sick now. Like I don't feel well.
[35:03.200 --> 35:06.660]  I don't... what? I'm not... I'm saying I should have known that, obviously,
[35:06.820 --> 35:10.760]  but I don't think it's crazy to not make that connection because it's such a small window of
[35:10.760 --> 35:17.180]  time. I think the reaction is so extreme because if you grow up, if you learn it and you notice it
[35:17.180 --> 35:23.640]  the time where you learn it for the first time, it's so normal to you that it's insane that people
[35:23.640 --> 35:30.640]  didn't know what they were saying this whole time. I feel like every child in the world is excited
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.720]  and counting down the days till they become a teenager, which begins the day you turn 13.
[35:36.300 --> 35:44.020]  I don't know how you don't. It's not just imbued in your psyche from growing up and being a child
[35:44.020 --> 35:50.260]  and being around other kids who also celebrate birthdays. I just didn't know when it started.
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.060]  It's not that I wasn't excited about it. I just wasn't. When did you think it started?
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.480]  I had no idea, Geoff. I had no clue when that transition happened from child to teen.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.600]  I didn't know. So you were 17 and you were wondering if you were a teen. I distinctly
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.060]  remember being 17 and thinking like, am I still a teenager? Did I miss the whole teenage thing?
[36:08.060 --> 36:16.580]  Where am I on this arc? You blink and you'll miss me. Yeah, that was sort of what it was. It's like,
[36:16.820 --> 36:20.520]  wow, did I go through my entire teenage years without even knowing I was a teenager?
[36:20.800 --> 36:24.500]  I never liked to make that declaration. So you were like, bopping along to Teenage Dirtbag,
[36:24.760 --> 36:32.400]  didn't realize the age range. Yeah, no clue. I just never made that association. I was just curious.
[36:32.540 --> 36:36.580]  I bet you some people who listen to this haven't either. And they'll learn something.
[36:38.600 --> 36:45.300]  I would love it if you're brave enough to put in the comments that you also didn't understand
[36:45.300 --> 36:50.660]  what being a teenager, what the age range of teenage years was. If you want to admit to that,
[36:50.780 --> 36:55.060]  where the whole world can see, I'd love to know it, because I kind of feel like Andrew's alone
[36:55.060 --> 37:00.240]  on an island here. I'm definitely not. I hope he is. I hope he is. This isn't like a crazy thing
[37:00.240 --> 37:04.880]  to not know. It is. It is 100% a crazy thing not to know. I just never made that connection.
[37:04.880 --> 37:09.140]  I was hoping one other person here also wouldn't have. Universal though,
[37:09.260 --> 37:15.820]  everyone knows. It's fine. I was just curious. You ever think about how much it sucks to be 20?
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.860]  It's such a weird year. You're not a teenager anymore, but you're not an adult. You have that
[37:22.860 --> 37:28.460]  one in-between year where you don't get to be a teenager, so you don't get to shrug your shoulders
[37:28.460 --> 37:34.040]  and say, eh, I'm just a teen, you know? I fucked up. But you don't get to go get drunk at a bar.
[37:34.040 --> 37:40.580]  You're just 20. It just sucks. Your insurance doesn't go down, you don't get any real benefits,
[37:40.820 --> 37:45.060]  but you lose the teen moniker, and you don't get to call yourself an adult.
[37:45.340 --> 37:49.020]  I didn't really have that. Yeah. But you didn't leave your house for the first 25 years.
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.380]  How would you? Well, I mean, I could drink at 18, so I wasn't thinking 20. What can't I do? I could
[37:55.380 --> 37:59.520]  do everything at 20. I guess maybe that's a fair point. I guess it's a uniquely American thing
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.540]  because the drinking age is 21 here. It's pretty high. That'd be one of the highest
[38:03.540 --> 38:08.140]  drinking ages on the planet. Yeah, yeah, it probably is the highest drinking age on the
[38:08.140 --> 38:14.780]  planet. I could drink as a teenager. What about you, Andrew? Yeah, I think 18. I'm not much of
[38:14.780 --> 38:19.800]  a drinker, so once again, not entirely sure when that started. I think 18. So when you say you're
[38:19.800 --> 38:26.460]  not much of a drinker, do you just never, ever drink even social things? I drank recently. I
[38:26.460 --> 38:33.160]  just... this is... okay. I just pulled everything out of the pantry and had a sip of it because
[38:33.160 --> 38:40.380]  I was just curious of just the things that I had. And I wouldn't recommend trying Chinese
[38:40.380 --> 38:46.540]  cooking wine. Not a great beverage. That's not a good one. That ranked the lowest of the things I
[38:46.540 --> 38:52.960]  had in my pantry. I didn't even know that was a thing. Chinese cooking wine. I'm assuming it's
[38:52.960 --> 38:56.940]  a cooking thing. I don't know why I have it. Chinese cooking wine, not a great beverage.
[38:57.700 --> 39:02.560]  Sake, of all the things I had, was by far the best. I have no memory of how I have these things
[39:02.560 --> 39:06.460]  or when I got them. But I had like five... Did you buy them? Yeah, I guess over time. I guess
[39:06.460 --> 39:11.340]  I would have. And I don't remember when. What do you think you were making when you bought the
[39:11.340 --> 39:16.460]  Chinese cooking wine? I have no clue what I was cooking. I don't... a lot of the things I'd never
[39:16.460 --> 39:20.940]  even opened. I opened them for the first time and I had a sip of everything. Sake, by far the best.
[39:21.280 --> 39:27.560]  Chinese cooking wine just tastes like ocean. I wouldn't recommend sipping it at all. I don't
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.120]  think you're supposed to. I had wine in the thing and it had an alcohol content, so I assumed it was
[39:32.120 --> 39:36.640]  drinkable. I assumed it was a beverage. But I'm gonna say no. According to Google, the United
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.820]  States and 11 other countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 21 years old. The highest
[39:41.820 --> 39:46.620]  minimum legal drinking age of all the countries where it's legal to drink. Although some areas
[39:46.620 --> 39:52.400]  of India have drinking ages as high as 30 years old. I mean, a lot of places in India you can't
[39:52.400 --> 39:56.180]  drink at all. That's true. A lot of places in the world you can't drink at all. But there are some
[39:56.180 --> 40:00.680]  places in India where I guess you can once you hit your 30s. Wow, that's insane. I didn't think...
[40:01.640 --> 40:07.260]  Wow, that's really high. I feel like you wouldn't want to drink if you hadn't drank by 30. You
[40:07.260 --> 40:11.060]  wouldn't do it. If you've made it to 30 without drinking, there'd be no reason to start.
[40:11.760 --> 40:17.800]  Maybe a high drinking age is a better thing. Yeah, I mean, I would have taken it as a challenge.
[40:19.500 --> 40:27.360]  I think you already did. Yeah, you know, I would agree with that. As the resident alcoholic in the
[40:27.830 --> 40:33.860]  I would argue that maybe it's better not to drink at all. That'd be a good argument. I have drunk
[40:33.860 --> 40:39.140]  once at a social event one time in my life, Gavin, and it was a disaster. Did you get drunk?
[40:39.680 --> 40:46.260]  I think I did. I was definitely on the edge. I was going to a Christmas party and I'm like,
[40:46.300 --> 40:49.100]  I'm not a big party guy. And I'm like, oh, I'd be really nice to like, I don't know,
[40:49.100 --> 40:54.740]  be more social or maybe, you know, I never drink. What if I try drinking and that'll maybe make me
[40:54.740 --> 40:58.320]  a little bit more social, be more comfortable. I won't have the anxiety I typically have.
[40:58.740 --> 41:04.440]  So I went into my kitchen, got a giant cup, like something from like 7-Eleven,
[41:04.760 --> 41:10.240]  like a Slurpee almost type cup. And I filled it with orange juice and vodka. I just put a bunch
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.760]  into both. I did no measuring. I just filled it and I drank it really quickly and it hit
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.680]  immediately and I felt like I had lava in my stomach, which I don't think is normal. I don't
[41:18.680 --> 41:23.880]  think you're supposed to feel that way. And I just started sweating profusely. I could not stop
[41:23.880 --> 41:29.660]  sweating. And so then I go for it's just like no matter what I do, every time I move, I feel
[41:29.660 --> 41:34.720]  lightheaded. My stomach feels like there's a fucking volcano inside of it. I can't stop sweating.
[41:35.020 --> 41:40.300]  It's doing all the opposite things that I want. Like that is not a good social look at a party
[41:40.300 --> 41:46.500]  where everyone's relaxed and you're just sweating profusely. And so I go from my place to my dad's
[41:46.500 --> 41:52.360]  and they're getting ready and soccer's on TV. I don't watch soccer at all. And I say to his
[41:52.360 --> 41:57.960]  girlfriend, you know why I hate soccer? Too many leagues. I just said that like I had no opinions
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.820]  on it. I'm so glad she didn't ask name more than one because I couldn't. It's like there's MLS. I
[42:02.820 --> 42:07.360]  guess there's the Premier League and MLS is all I know, but certainly that's not an extreme amount.
[42:07.720 --> 42:11.980]  Bundesliga. Yeah, I didn't know that one either. So that like my point, I know two leagues.
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.460]  I just was saying stuff. It was like I was on the brink of not being able to control what I was
[42:17.460 --> 42:22.760]  tight to be able to say what I wanted. So then I didn't want to speak at all.
[42:23.340 --> 42:27.480]  Yeah. So I didn't want to speak at all. So then we go to the party. I'm still sweating profusely.
[42:27.620 --> 42:32.420]  I still feel like I have a volcano in my stomach and I'm just not talking to people, just sitting
[42:33.380 --> 42:38.780]  sweating nonstop. I cannot stop it. Or I'm having brief conversations. It made it a million times
[42:38.780 --> 42:44.980]  worse. It was a terrible, terrible social experience. So I just don't drink. I didn't
[42:44.980 --> 42:49.440]  drink before that. And I don't drink socially now. And I'm not opposed to it. I just don't do it.
[42:49.720 --> 42:54.060]  Oh, God. What made you pick vodka and orange juice?
[42:54.420 --> 43:00.040]  Because it's just what I had. It was what was available at that time. And I just wanted to
[43:00.040 --> 43:03.700]  drink because I don't like the taste of alcohol. Had you ever had that before?
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.400]  No, I don't think so. I literally just filled a giant cup with both.
[43:09.040 --> 43:10.900]  Just one big sweaty screwdriver.
[43:10.900 --> 43:15.620]  Just one massive, yeah, sweaty screwdriver. So your chemistry must be off or something.
[43:15.820 --> 43:18.400]  I feel like nothing has the desired effect on you.
[43:18.800 --> 43:23.360]  I think I might be allergic. I don't think those are normal. Like, I get stuffed up and sweaty
[43:23.360 --> 43:26.640]  whenever I drink. Did you throw up at all from the alcohol?
[43:26.660 --> 43:31.460]  No. No, I didn't. And you drank a big gulp size...
[43:32.400 --> 43:35.120]  I didn't drink all of it. I drank a lot of it. Okay.
[43:35.500 --> 43:38.380]  It was a lot. So would you say that you were drunk or you
[43:38.380 --> 43:40.420]  were just feeling side effects that weren't anything to do with?
[43:40.420 --> 43:44.760]  Well, I don't have anything to compare it to. I think it's maybe the most drunk I've been.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.740]  I'm assuming that's what being drunk is. I've never been like black before.
[43:47.740 --> 43:51.260]  It's hard to describe being drunk. I feel like stuff's just floaty.
[43:51.600 --> 43:54.040]  Everything's floaty and warm. Fuzzy, yeah.
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.160]  Everything kind of feels like a hug. Had the warmth.
[43:56.820 --> 44:02.660]  And it starts to get a little hazy and spinny, I would say.
[44:02.920 --> 44:06.600]  Okay. I was probably drunk then. I mean, I definitely would have been drunk,
[44:06.600 --> 44:11.800]  but it was like, I had an awareness to it. So then I just didn't really want to talk to anybody.
[44:12.160 --> 44:16.020]  I was like, I don't know if I have full control here at this time.
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.380]  I'm just going to be yelling about soccer leagues, a sport I don't watch or actually
[44:20.380 --> 44:23.880]  have any opinions about. Just had to chime in.
[44:24.060 --> 44:25.680]  I just had to chime in. Too many leagues.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.560]  Were they soccer fans or did it just happen to be on the TV?
[44:28.560 --> 44:31.380]  No, it just happened to be on TV. There was no soccer
[44:31.920 --> 44:35.500]  established thing at all. It was just what was on. Too many leagues.
[44:35.500 --> 44:39.760]  I bet you've bet on soccer before, though. Oh, I've bet on...
[44:39.760 --> 44:43.500]  Do you want to get into the... Oh my God. Pavel Khodov, I fucking hate you.
[44:43.840 --> 44:46.780]  You're never going to listen to this. No one knows you exist.
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.520]  Cannot stand you. You're my archenemy in life. You're awful.
[44:50.860 --> 44:52.760]  Is this handball? This isn't handball.
[44:52.860 --> 44:58.180]  This is Russian tennis. This was a Russian qualifier tennis tournament.
[44:58.720 --> 45:01.880]  It's maybe the most angry I've ever been about any gambling thing ever.
[45:01.880 --> 45:05.540]  I had this idea of I'm just going to bet on massive favorites one night,
[45:05.680 --> 45:09.360]  and I was betting really tiny amounts, but I kept winning because they're massive favorites.
[45:10.020 --> 45:16.940]  Pavel Khodov was more than a four-time going to win. The other guy was a nine-to-one underdog.
[45:17.480 --> 45:24.100]  I spent the entire night watching this game as Pavel Khodov blew his lead slowly throughout the
[45:24.100 --> 45:30.860]  night. I was up until 3 a.m. on a stat tracker website following this Russian tennis qualifier
[45:30.860 --> 45:35.900]  that nobody else on the planet cares about, losing my mind because Pavel Khodov doesn't
[45:35.900 --> 45:40.580]  know how to close a game. Maybe the worst tennis player of all time. He's going against a guy that
[45:40.580 --> 45:45.760]  had won like $1,000 in all his years playing tennis, and he was in his mid-30s. So this is
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.220]  a hobby. He lost to a guy who's a hobbyist. Outrageous. Did you have a lot of money riding
[45:50.220 --> 45:55.300]  on this? No, it was like $10, but I was just furious. Couldn't believe it.
[45:55.300 --> 46:00.430]  Do you think you're the only person in history to bet on Pavel? What was his name? Pavel Khodov?
[46:01.780 --> 46:07.820]  Pavel Khodov. I don't know about that. Never bet on Pavel Khodov. Don't do it.
[46:08.020 --> 46:09.660]  That guy has a baseball card. We need to get it.
[46:10.060 --> 46:13.120]  He doesn't. He definitely doesn't. A tennis baseball card?
[46:13.420 --> 46:19.680]  And the worst part... the worst part is there's nobody to complain to about Pavel Khodov because
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.500]  nobody knows who it is. It's a Russian qualifier that nobody cares about. So I'm like looking
[46:24.500 --> 46:30.440]  online to try to find any place I could rant to about, can you fucking believe Pavel Khodov
[46:30.440 --> 46:35.980]  blew six match points in a row and lost? This is the worst thing ever. I hate Pavel Khodov.
[46:36.160 --> 46:38.760]  I certainly didn't give a shit when you texted me about it.
[46:38.940 --> 46:40.480]  I was infuriated.
[46:42.420 --> 46:46.940]  Speaking of, I have tennis lessons tomorrow. You just reminded me. Very excited.
[46:47.160 --> 46:48.120]  You're doing tennis lessons?
[46:48.160 --> 46:49.580]  You guys know I've been taking tennis lessons?
[46:49.920 --> 46:50.200]  Why?
[46:50.200 --> 46:52.080]  Uh, to play tennis.
[46:52.480 --> 46:55.580]  Oh, no, I mean, yeah, I gathered that. I'm just...
[46:55.580 --> 46:59.900]  I've been, I've been, I've been taking lessons for like three months now. Two months, two,
[46:59.960 --> 47:01.300]  two, three months. Yeah.
[47:01.420 --> 47:03.040]  Why'd you want to, why'd you want to get good at tennis?
[47:03.420 --> 47:09.780]  Uh, it seems like a, I mean, A, it's something different to do. It's a sport. It's an outside
[47:09.780 --> 47:15.420]  activity. You know, I have that whole issue with the arthritis in my shoulder and how I'm dying
[47:15.420 --> 47:20.720]  slowly from the inside. And I thought it might help like lube, lube up my arm and keep me mobile,
[47:20.840 --> 47:24.420]  keep me moving from, from getting the, uh, the thing that they told me was going to happen to
[47:24.420 --> 47:27.980]  me that I'm terrified of, which is that my shoulder will freeze in place for the rest of my life. And
[47:27.980 --> 47:31.200]  I'll never be able to use my arm properly again. So I thought like, this would be a good way to
[47:31.200 --> 47:37.540]  do it. And so, yeah, like, uh, every week, uh, for probably three months now, taken,
[47:37.700 --> 47:42.920]  taking tennis lessons on Fridays now, used to be on Saturdays and it's fun and it's socially
[47:42.920 --> 47:47.660]  responsible because it's, uh, distanced and it's COVID safe. Oh, you still have to touch the ball.
[47:48.140 --> 47:55.120]  Not if you play right. I always wondered, I know it'd be really hard to do, but if you hit somebody
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.720]  with the ball, you immediately get a point. And I always thought if I was a professional tennis
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.560]  player, that's all I'd do off the serve is just try to get a point. Well, if you hit the person
[48:03.560 --> 48:08.540]  with the ball, like if you're serving and I hit you with the ball and obviously you can't hit it
[48:08.540 --> 48:13.320]  back, like I just pelt you with it, then I get the point. Let's hit the ground though. Well, no,
[48:13.420 --> 48:18.380]  if I, I'm aiming directly at you. Oh wait, off the serve. No, off the serve, I would have to hit the
[48:18.380 --> 48:21.280]  ground. You're right. So it'd have to be the follow-up shot. I'd have to hit it in the box
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.160]  on the serve. I just always thought that pelting the person with the ball would be easier than,
[48:25.620 --> 48:30.740]  than like the volley. That would be my strategy for tennis is just trying to inflict damage with
[48:30.740 --> 48:35.040]  the ball. And yeah, I feel like if you're trying to hit them, you're gonna have to hit hard enough
[48:35.040 --> 48:38.860]  so that they can't react. Yeah. But if you miss, then it's definitely going out.
[48:39.140 --> 48:43.600]  It's a high risk, high reward, but I don't know if anyone in the tennis game has attempted this
[48:43.600 --> 48:51.760]  strategy. You either get the point or you don't, but isn't that every play? You either win or you
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.740]  don't. We haven't, we haven't covered that section of tennis yet in my classes, but I will definitely
[48:56.740 --> 49:02.480]  bring up, uh, like strategies for hitting your opponent. Is it just you and like an instructor?
[49:02.480 --> 49:09.380]  Are there other people there? Well, I took an initial, a small class of like three people.
[49:09.520 --> 49:16.260]  It was me, Emily, uh, and then another lady, uh, and then did that for a month, two months,
[49:16.380 --> 49:22.700]  maybe. And then I, we got up like a private tennis coach, uh, A cause it seems safer. And then B,
[49:22.720 --> 49:27.660]  it's like, it's, you just get more time, you know, honestly. And so, uh, Emily and I, we,
[49:27.660 --> 49:32.860]  we take a private lesson with a, with a dude, uh, shout out to Brent tennis coach. He's pretty
[49:32.860 --> 49:40.740]  fucking good. Uh, and, uh, yeah, it's just like an hour or yeah, about an hour, uh, every week he
[49:40.740 --> 49:45.500]  tells us how not to do dumb shit. And then I play tennis probably three times a week with Emily,
[49:45.680 --> 49:49.400]  you know, just go hit the ball around. Does he make you like serve into a hula hoop?
[49:49.680 --> 49:53.400]  Ooh, no, I haven't done that yet. I haven't served into a hula hoop. Have you done any foot
[49:53.400 --> 49:57.260]  exercises? Are you on like the ladder on the ground? Are you doing the sewing machine?
[49:57.600 --> 50:02.900]  Are you working on your foot movement? No, we don't do that stuff. We hit the ball a lot.
[50:03.180 --> 50:10.060]  And we, we, we practice rushing the net and like forearms and back arms for a long time and volleys
[50:10.060 --> 50:15.880]  and continental grip versus, you know, wait, Andrew, you play tennis. I play tennis for a
[50:15.880 --> 50:19.460]  long time, but I'm just surprised. No foot exercises at all. You're just hitting the ball.
[50:19.460 --> 50:25.260]  Well, he doesn't have straw ankles. No, it's not even straw ankles. It's foot movement. You gotta
[50:25.260 --> 50:28.880]  have quick feet in tennis. You gotta move. Yeah, we do a lot of like side to side movement and
[50:28.880 --> 50:34.080]  knowing like how to anticipate the ball. And like we do a lot of rotations and stuff, a lot of drills,
[50:34.400 --> 50:39.080]  but at no point did he use those terms. Either of my coaches. I'm just curious.
[50:39.560 --> 50:43.200]  What is this sewing machine? Yeah, the sewing machine and climbing the ladder.
[50:43.700 --> 50:47.840]  No, you lay the ladder down. It's like a plastic ladder and you lay it down and you have to go
[50:47.840 --> 50:52.700]  through each rung between the rungs of it. Sounds like NFL training camp. Yeah, it is. It's sort of
[50:52.700 --> 50:56.600]  like a combine thing, but that's what that was part of the thing when I played tennis that you
[50:56.600 --> 51:02.700]  do. So who brought the ladder? The coach did, the instructor. What kind of ladder was it? It's
[51:02.700 --> 51:06.980]  like it's not a real ladder. You couldn't climb. It's a very flimsy. It's a floppy ladder. You lay
[51:06.980 --> 51:11.140]  it on the ground. Like a rope ladder? It wasn't like an A-frame? No, it was more like a plastic.
[51:11.340 --> 51:17.320]  It wasn't a rope ladder. It was more like a... what's another type of material that isn't rope?
[51:17.320 --> 51:24.920]  Almost like a velcro-ish type material, but not velcro. A velcro ladder? Like felt? Yeah, like more
[51:24.920 --> 51:32.360]  of a felty type thing. Yeah. Glass? It wasn't glass. That'd be horrifying. Oh, high risk. It seems
[51:32.360 --> 51:37.480]  dangerous. How'd you break your leg? I was playing tennis with a ladder. When you don't play it with
[51:37.480 --> 51:41.520]  it, it's part of the training. It's like practicing footwork. You practice all aspects of your game.
[51:41.900 --> 51:46.240]  I think you're probably at an age, no disrespect to you, your footwork is probably what your
[51:46.240 --> 51:51.940]  footwork is. You're also not, you know... I'll take it. My footwork's fucking on point. I don't know.
[51:51.960 --> 51:56.880]  I would kick your ass in tennis, buddy. If we did the sewing machine, I would demolish you in the
[51:56.880 --> 52:01.400]  sewing machine. It is a complicated procedure. You got one foot in, one foot out. You got to go side
[52:01.400 --> 52:05.720]  to side. Can you describe it? I want a picture of the sewing machine. It's really hard to describe
[52:05.720 --> 52:09.940]  because it's hard to do. It's one of those things where when you try to learn it. Okay, so... You draw
[52:09.940 --> 52:15.300]  a diagram? No, I can't. How do I draw a diagram for physical... Here's the thing, Andrew. Whenever
[52:15.300 --> 52:19.920]  we ask you to draw something, you're never ready to go. Yeah, well, no, but this is a complicated
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.040]  thing to draw. This needs to go in the zine, so I'm going to need you to figure out how to draw it.
[52:24.640 --> 52:29.820]  Well, that's Gavin's job. This is Andrew's tennis tips. No, I'll give the tips. Gavin's drawing.
[52:30.180 --> 52:35.400]  We already gave that job to him. So you put... You go one foot in the first rung, then the second
[52:35.400 --> 52:40.060]  foot in, and then one foot to the right side. The sewing machine uses the ladder as well?
[52:40.640 --> 52:43.980]  Yeah, it's... You have to go between the ladder. That's why it's called the sewing machine. It's
[52:43.980 --> 52:51.000]  like you're stitching. It's like you're stitching with your feet. Okay. So one foot in, other foot
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.700]  in, then the first foot you had in goes out to the side, then the other foot goes out to the side,
[52:55.840 --> 53:00.480]  then the other foot goes into the next set of rungs, and then so on and so on until you...
[53:00.480 --> 53:04.600]  So it's in, in, out, out, in, in, out, out. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It sounds like sideways
[53:04.600 --> 53:11.620]  hopscotch. I never played hopscotch. I don't know. What was... Did you go to school?
[53:11.620 --> 53:18.740]  Yeah. Yeah. He was absent the day they covered hopscotch in teenage years. I played red ball,
[53:18.800 --> 53:22.920]  and I played soccer. Look, you go to school, your first day, you look at the ground, there's
[53:22.920 --> 53:27.240]  a hopscotch. It's like lesson one in being a school child, that you just see, they're everywhere.
[53:27.480 --> 53:31.360]  If you look at a chessboard, doesn't mean you know how to play. I've seen them. I just, I don't
[53:31.360 --> 53:39.060]  know the mechanics. Oh my god, they're... they're... wow. I think you are conflating that, buddy. There
[53:39.060 --> 53:47.160]  is no correlation between chess... oh my god... and hopscotch. My point is, if you look at where
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.840]  the place is played, the court of play doesn't tell you how the game is played necessarily.
[53:51.360 --> 53:55.540]  I don't know the rules. I don't know how you move. You just have to watch like a seven-year-old
[53:55.540 --> 54:00.100]  for one second, and then you know how to play. Why am I watching seven-year-olds play hopscotch?
[54:00.420 --> 54:04.660]  There's no reason for me to do that. Because you're also seven. No, I'm playing soccer. I'm
[54:04.660 --> 54:09.780]  playing red ball. I don't have time for that. That's not a different... What is red ball? It's
[54:09.780 --> 54:14.360]  that game that kids played where it has like a million different names, where like you had...
[54:14.360 --> 54:18.640]  I don't remember the rules exactly, but you had to throw the ball and then catch it, or if it hit
[54:18.640 --> 54:24.640]  you or something... Dodgeball? Dodgeball. No, it's not dodgeball. You... if you missed, you had...
[54:24.640 --> 54:28.360]  yeah, it was like wall ball. I think that's another term for it. You had to stand on the wall and...
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.140]  well, yeah, you throw... it's like a tennis ball. You throw it at the wall. If you screw up in some
[54:32.140 --> 54:36.480]  way, you have to stand in front of the wall and you get pelted with the ball. And then it just goes
[54:36.480 --> 54:40.640]  back to play until someone else has to get up. Oh, I never played that. So you... what you're describing to me
[54:41.220 --> 54:46.160]  is a made-up game called red ball where the kids stood you in front of a wall and pelted you with
[54:46.160 --> 54:52.540]  tennis balls. No. No, I was very rarely pelted. I don't think you... I don't know if I was ever pelted. I don't think you were playing a sport. I think you were being... I think you were being bullied.
[54:52.940 --> 54:58.500]  Geoff, if there was a red... red ball hall of fame, I would be in it. I was never pelted once. I have
[54:58.500 --> 55:01.480]  no memories of being pelted. I was an exceptional red ball player.
[55:03.820 --> 55:08.580]  That was weird. Why did nobody had a follow-up to their own? I thought... I thought Geoff was
[55:08.580 --> 55:14.100]  gonna talk. No, I'm just disappointed in the whole hopscotch thing. What about it? Just like... I feel
[55:14.100 --> 55:19.660]  like... I feel like if you just look at the ground and you see hopscotch, you know how to play it.
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.460]  I can't believe you compared it to chess. Can you imagine a show like Queen's Gambit but about the
[55:24.460 --> 55:29.860]  best hopscotch players? It's like you don't teach a horse how to stand up. It just... it doesn't.
[55:30.220 --> 55:34.080]  When it's born, the mama horse looks at it and says, stand up. And the horse is like,
[55:34.180 --> 55:39.840]  okay, it's natural. I'll do it. That's hopscotch. I will send you a thing, Geoff. I bet you I could
[55:39.840 --> 55:44.640]  blow your sewing machine time out of the water. We can do it with chalk. Today? You can do a chalk
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.620]  setup. Not today. Today? Because I'm still... my ankle's recovering. I have a marathon still on.
[55:48.620 --> 55:53.980]  I don't care about sewing machines and ladders and climbing the sewing machine and whatever that is.
[55:53.980 --> 55:59.240]  You said you had exceptional footwork. I do. I feel confident in my footwork, but I would rather
[55:59.240 --> 56:03.640]  show it to you by playing you in tennis. Are you prepared to get pelted by balls? I'm prepared to
[56:03.640 --> 56:09.500]  dodge them and win those points. Andrew, I couldn't beat you in tennis, but I would wipe the floor
[56:09.500 --> 56:13.960]  with you in a sewing machine. There's no way you could beat me in a sewing machine. All right,
[56:13.980 --> 56:18.380]  we're having a three-man sewing machine tournament. That's the ladder. The next time. That is the...
[56:18.380 --> 56:23.020]  Eric just posted the ladder in the Discord. That's what you work with. Agility ladder. Oh,
[56:23.020 --> 56:27.880]  so specifically for this one purpose. Well, it's, I mean, there are all sorts of different exercises
[56:27.880 --> 56:33.240]  you can do using that ladder, but it was, uh, the sewing machine was always my favorite. I was
[56:33.240 --> 56:36.880]  really good at the sewing machine. Do you see what's right above the ladder is a little girl
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.080]  in red shoes playing hopscotch? I'm gonna let you in on a secret. Nobody taught her how to play
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.520]  hopscotch. She figured it out. No. All right, Andrew, how do you, in your head, how do you play
[56:45.520 --> 56:56.440]  hopscotch? Well, I need to see the board first of all. I need to evaluate. So you have to,
[56:56.860 --> 57:01.560]  one foot in the one hole, two foot, like when there's two, you have to put both feet in those
[57:01.560 --> 57:05.840]  holes, I'm guessing. And then there's numbers. I'm not sure how the numbers correlate. Okay,
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.240]  I'm looking at this now. One, two, three, four. So I'm guessing you just have to hop in the
[57:10.240 --> 57:15.940]  sequence of the numbers. So one foot, one foot, two feet, one foot, two feet, one foot. Is that
[57:15.940 --> 57:19.320]  hopscotch? There's variants too, like sometimes you gotta chuck shit and land them in the numbers.
[57:19.740 --> 57:23.300]  You throw like a beanbag at a number and then you have to jump into that number. Or a stone
[57:23.300 --> 57:30.040]  if you're poor. You don't have beanbag money. Nah, I just used to pick up a nearby rock.
[57:32.740 --> 57:36.600]  Well, where do you have, in Gavin's defense, it's not even a money thing. Very rarely in life
[57:36.600 --> 57:45.140]  do I ever have beanbags. I need to think of a time I've had one. I think that's a great place
[57:45.640 --> 57:52.220]  to end it right there. I imagine you'd be good at hacky sack and stuff. I was never good at hacky
[57:52.220 --> 57:56.620]  sack. The kid's got glass ankles, he can't do anything ankle related. No, the sewing machine,
[57:56.780 --> 58:04.440]  I'm amazing at. He's talking a good sewing machine game, but I bet you if you put him out there it'd
[58:04.440 --> 58:11.740]  fucking Samuel L. Jackson in Unbreakable. Andrew, realistically, actually, not even for content,
[58:11.920 --> 58:16.720]  do you think you could beat me at sewing machine? Not even for, I couldn't be more certain.
[58:17.180 --> 58:21.540]  Absolutely. How much do you want to put on this? I'd put whatever you wanted on it,
[58:21.580 --> 58:25.720]  because sewing machine was my shit. I was always exceptionally good at sewing machine.
[58:25.880 --> 58:32.720]  What if we put $300 on a sewing machine? Sure, that works for me. Once again, it's like my back
[58:32.720 --> 58:38.460]  and my tall thing. You would think I'm way taller. On the sewing machine, you would think I was
[58:38.460 --> 58:43.940]  Usain Bolt for how quick I would clear that ladder when you do sewing machine. There'd be kids that
[58:43.940 --> 58:49.620]  were faster than I was, and I would catch them every time. I'd have to slow down for them. I was
[58:49.620 --> 58:54.100]  dominant on the sewing machine. I just can't imagine it. Bold statement. I'm sure that's
[58:54.100 --> 58:58.420]  what it's called. I don't think Eric can even find it. I think Eric thinks that I've made this up.
[58:58.420 --> 59:02.980]  I'm almost 100% sure it was called the sewing machine. Well, it might have been just what your
[59:02.980 --> 59:08.360]  coach called it. It could be. That'd be weird if they invented their own name for the thing.
[59:08.440 --> 59:13.060]  That'd be strange. This was a podcast about absolutely nothing today. They're all about
[59:13.060 --> 59:19.360]  nothing. One question quickly before we close this, I guess. When you throw the bean bag onto
[59:19.360 --> 59:27.120]  the hopscotch, what does that mean? If I remember correctly, you had to throw sequentially. And if
[59:27.120 --> 59:31.540]  you missed, you'd still have to hit that number. Oh, so it's like cornhole with hopping. But you
[59:31.540 --> 59:35.480]  still have to go the length of the hopscotch. And you could draw them. You could draw some
[59:36.280 --> 59:39.940]  pretty wicked looking ones. So it's just you have to throw it and then jump there.
[59:40.380 --> 59:44.640]  Okay, I got it. I think it's like whoever gets to 10 first wins or something, right?
[59:45.200 --> 59:49.480]  Oh, both of these boards say 8, Geoff. As the hopscotch enthusiast, it seems like 8 is the
[59:49.480 --> 59:54.940]  standard. But if a bishop plays, he can only play diagonally. That's true. One of the rules
[59:54.940 --> 01:00:00.720]  of hopscotch. Yeah, I get it. It's a chess joke. Very funny. It's a very funny chess joke.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:07.560]  We got to stop this. Yeah, I think we're good. That's a good episode. This one wore me out.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.780]  I think you're tired from the last one. Maybe we shouldn't have done two. No, I think it's
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:18.320]  fine. Andrew has a thing where he makes my brain tired sometimes. No, it was the bat thing. I think
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.600]  you're fatigued from learning about the bat thing previous episode. It's possible that I was a
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.420]  little on edge from the bat stuff, but I think it felt like it really went downhill for me when
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:33.080]  you flustered me with the teenage stuff. I would be interested to see in the comments, like you
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.960]  said, if other people are blown away. I don't think that's going to be the revelation. No, I don't
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.960]  think based on this, I'm going to say maybe 10% of people that hear this. It's got to be less.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:50.220]  I can't imagine it's that high. Yeah, it's probably like 5%. If it was higher, if it was higher than
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:56.060]  1%, I would be shocked. Somebody is definitely going to have this realization like I did.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:04.580]  You say there are some people out there who have voted. Oh, 100%. People that I would consider
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:09.020]  smart haven't made this realization. It was surprising to them. It's just sometimes you
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.120]  don't think about that stuff. I don't think you have to. I think some stuff's just intrinsic
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:20.720]  knowledge that you gain through, I don't know, osmosis. Just through existence. I mean, I didn't.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:27.820]  Nobody teaches you how to breathe or blink your eyes. You just kind of know. But if you think
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:34.720]  about it, it gets a little weird. It does. You're right about that. Don't ever become self-aware.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.240]  Don't ever think about blinking or breathing because it'll ruin about 30 minutes of your
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.240]  life when you try to equalize and get back to normal. Someone at school once told me that if
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.060]  you don't push your eyes in once a month, they start to come forward and eventually fall out.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.600]  Did you push your eyes in once a month for like 10 years? Yeah, I just closed my eyes and just
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.480]  lightly push on them just to make sure. I didn't know if it was true, but I didn't want to find out.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:07.100]  What is the weirdest thing you can do? You have a weird skill as far as, I guess,
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:13.880]  anything? Weird skill. Like a distinct... I don't have the skill to end podcasts, that's for sure.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.480]  I can put a chain through my nose and out my mouth and only throw up 11 times doing it.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.940]  I can hold one leg and jump over it. I can do that thing where you walk like a crab,
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:34.000]  like you hang your legs over your arms. Okay. Not really skills, just things that I've tried
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.140]  and I haven't hurt myself doing yet. I'm sure anyone could do those things. How about you, Andrew?
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:45.720]  I can wiggle my ears. I can wiggle my ears as well. Can you? That's great. Yeah. No wonder we're
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.340]  friends. I've been looking for an ear wiggler my entire life and I didn't expect it would be you.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.180]  God didn't give me ears like this without the power to use them. How much height do you
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:01.020]  think... we should do an ear combine. How much elevation can you get without moving any other
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.060]  part of your body? Can you guys go up and down? Yeah. I was thinking like side to side. No, I can do either.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.640]  I can do either. Wow, you might have more... Geoff might be a better ear mover than I am.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:16.700]  Maybe, maybe, maybe not. I don't know. I don't want to... I'm not trying to like... I'm not trying
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:20.560]  to flex on you. I'm just saying I can also... I'm not confident in the way you're confident
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.980]  with sewing machines. I'm just saying I can win layers. Can you do one up, one down? No. No, I'm doing
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.780]  both right now. I think I can do the right one up. I don't think I can do the left one
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.000]  independently, but I can do the right one if that makes sense. I can't do it. I guess I just have
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.660]  standard ears. Standard ears. Now we're just all wiggling our fucking ears quietly. I'm wearing
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:48.540]  headphones. I don't even... I'm doing it through the headphones. What? You shitting me? No. I can move
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:54.640]  like the inner ear too. Your canal? Yeah, like I'm moving... I got a little canal moving.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:04.540]  What does that mean? I know what I can do that a lot of people don't seem to be able to do,
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:10.340]  but is a totally real thing. I can turn my nose off. What does that mean? I can choose not to
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.660]  smell. That's why I don't understand when people's stuff smells bad and people freak out about it.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.600]  I can just turn my nose off and not smell. And I've googled it and a lot of people can do it.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.780]  A lot of people can do it. The people that know how to turn their nose off are surprised. I don't
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.840]  know how to explain it and don't know how to... how other people can't do it. Are you just not
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.080]  breathing through your nose? No, no, no. There's more than that. There's like... I can... there's
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.440]  like little flaps. I can feel them in the back of my nose and that you just like... you like just
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.780]  like move a muscle and they like freeze up and then no smell gets through. What are you talking
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.900]  about? I don't... I think you're a maniac. Are you a fucking alien from the faculty? What are you
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.640]  talking about? You can close your nose. End. End. End the show. No, Eric, we can't end. Do you hear
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.940]  what he just said? You have to end the show. He has a nose switch. What are you talking about?
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.240]  This is... this is insane. He's just talking about not breathing through his nose for a short period.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.000]  No, no, no, no. It's not. It's different. It's different. It's different. Right. No, he said
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.180]  that it's different. I understand that he said it was different. But with your nose off, could you
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.060]  take a breath through your nose and still smell nothing? I don't know. I don't know. I've never
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:15.860]  tried that. It's because he's just not breathing through his fucking nose. The particles land on
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:22.860]  shit inside your nose. Have you seen the faculty, Geoff? You must. Yeah. Yeah, I saw it here. I saw
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:28.040]  it here in Austin. Is it like that? Is it like that level of nose control? Is that we're talking
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:33.180]  for blockage? I don't remember the nose control part of the faculty. I just know that like if
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:38.100]  something smells bad and it's not just turning. It's not just not smelling because people swear
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.960]  to me that they can still smell something even if they just don't breathe through their nose. So
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:46.440]  you've got smell doors. I got smell doors. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've got like barn doors on a camera.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:51.500]  I have like smell doors. I don't think you do have that. I do. I do. I do. And I guarantee you
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:56.900]  more people in the comments will agree that they also have smell doors than people that don't
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.500]  understand how teenage years work. I think if they're at the back of your nose, that's behind
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:05.620]  all of your receptors anyway, though. I don't know, dude. I'm just telling you I can turn off smell
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:09.720]  and then I don't smell anymore. The problem too now is if I search for it, everything's COVID
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.760]  related because of the goddamn COVID thing. But before that, there was a whole thread. I've read
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:18.700]  lots of like forum threads and stuff from other people that are like, hey, how come?
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.080]  How come I do this and people are freaked out by it and say they don't know what I'm talking about?
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.580]  Am I the only one that can do this? And then like about one in every five or six people be like, oh,
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.560]  no, I can totally do that, too. It always weirds me out when people people don't understand that
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.280]  you can do it and people don't know how to do it. And none of us know how to tell you how to do it.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.340]  It's just something that you know how to do. Of course, the guy with some of the worst smelling
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:44.600]  farts on the planet is also the guy that can turn off his nose. I appreciate that. Thank you.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.740]  I could turn this podcast off. Can you end this podcast in the same way?
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.060]  All right. This has been another episode of F*** Face. I believe it was episode 28.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.260]  Is that right? Or 29? No, we did 28 last time.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:05.900]  29. This has been episode 29 of the F*** Face podcast. I hope you liked it. I hope you're one
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:11.700]  of the people out there who understands how age works. And probably if you are, you also know how
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:16.620]  to play hopscotch. I never made the connection. I get it now. I hope you make the connection
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:22.260]  to the like and subscribe button. I hope you make the connection to five stars and
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.500]  gee, boy, gee, we really appreciate it that you listen to it. And thanks for saying I didn't
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:35.120]  understand the connection between 22 and 23. I don't I don't see how that
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:41.940]  connects at all. I was I was 27 years old before I realized, wait a minute, this shit's sequential.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:48.880]  I always knew that. That's obvious. But it's a it's a pronunciation of the numbers to a very
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:55.120]  specific set of years. It's not just it's not just numbers. It's a word thing and how they are
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:01.700]  applied to those numbers. It's literally numbers. No, but it's the pronunciation of those numbers.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:07.460]  The only numbers you as the audience need to be worried about are the numbers five out of five
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:13.260]  stars or ten out of ten stars or how many fucking stars it is. Where do the stars come from? Why
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:17.820]  don't we always ask people to rate us with the stars? Is that like an Apple thing or Spotify
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:23.120]  thing? Apple, I don't know. I thought you actually meant way before Apple. Yeah, it is way before
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:29.400]  Apple. But this Apple is the one that we're like relying on. eBay. Yeah, eBay. Give us five eBay
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.080]  stars. Thank you. Plus for listening and find us on Instagram FacePod. We'll see you next time.
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:41.300]  How many goodbyes would you shut up? Shut up by our zine. Shut up by the zine. 6 p.m.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.780]  I still Andrew, I still don't know what it is. The sewing machine. I don't understand.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.560]  I keep looking it up and I don't I can't. I'm looking up sewing machine exercises.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:06.360]  I'm looking up sewing machine like contests. I'm looking up sewing machine like like P.E.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:12.940]  I got nothing, dude. I think. Wait, I think I let me look. Let me look at it. I'm trying to find a
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:16.920]  video of it. All of these are like 10 minutes long and it's just like I don't want that. I'm
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.060]  just looking for one. I don't need to know what I give me any minutes. I have zero minutes right now.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:27.080]  Google's not helping me. Dude, I don't like it has to be called like it's not that's not the name
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.220]  of it. That's not the name of anything. It is. It's I think it's the step shuffle, but this guy
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.940]  has terrible form. It's cheating. Dude, I'm searching step shuffle sewing machine and it's
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:42.920]  just goddamn fucking sewing machines. But it's with the ladder. That's with the ladder.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:51.440]  Do you think your tennis instructor in your tennis class created something, some piece of
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.340]  busy work to do off on the side while everybody else played tennis? Like, no, Andrew, you're the
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:10:00.260]  king of the sewing machine. Keep it up. If you can beat your time, I bet you can beat your time.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.320]  Anyway, kids, we're going to go serve. If you say it's the icky shuffle, I'm going to be real mad.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:15.080]  Is it this? I'll show. How do we have a disclaimer for a fucking what are we doing?
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:20.500]  I'm watching the top. Well, the disclaimer is, hey, this isn't fake or invented by a man on a
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.600]  podcast. This is a real thing. You just think it's fake. Look at what the first guy's doing.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.200]  I don't know. It is not the shuffle. That's a great shuffle. The daintiest shuffle.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:42.160]  What? Which video is this? Both feed in before you can vote.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:56.050]  Andrew, you can link with a timestamp. Yeah, well, that makes work, man. I'm watching
[01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:02.030]  shuffle videos. Figure it out. It's the second exercise he does. It's early in the video.
[01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:08.210]  It's the two feet in? No, it's not two feet in.
[01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:12.790]  Crossover shuffle? Crossover shuffle. It's like the crossover shuffle.
[01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:15.370]  Give us a time. Oh, that actually looks difficult.
[01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:19.530]  He's cheating. You're supposed to have both feet in before you move the other one.
[01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:22.390]  He's only ever putting one in. That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:26.690]  Like a proper sewing machine, both feet in before the other one.
[01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:30.050]  You keep calling it a sewing machine. Because that's what it's called.
[01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:32.550]  It's not what it's called. It's what it was called.
[01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:39.950]  No, it's what somebody you know called it. What am I supposed to call it?
[01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:43.710]  Because he's got bad sewing machine form. That is what the sewing machine is.
[01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.670]  We're not even recording this. What's going on?
[01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.290]  This is bad in the episode.
[01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:53.630]  It's 100% bad in the episode. Which one is it?
[01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:01.250]  Third one, the step shuffle, Geoff. It's the second thing he does.
[01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:05.930]  This is the icky shuffle. No, it's not the icky shuffle.
[01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:07.910]  No, it's not. It is!
[01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:11.770]  We need to record. Where is the icky shuffle?
[01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:14.390]  Look at this woman break it down slowly.
[01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:19.910]  Yeah, because I looked up icky shuffle and it wasn't anything like what I was saying.
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:26.230]  Look at the way she does it in 25 seconds. It's two feet in and then she steps out.
[01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:31.350]  She never has both in. Yes, she does.
[01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:32.950]  Yes, she does. There's a brief moment.
[01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:35.950]  You know what it is? Yeah, I guess it is the icky shuffle, but not all.
[01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:39.750]  Oh, really interesting. Really fucking interesting how it's not the icky shuffle.
[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:41.250]  And then it's the icky shuffle.
[01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:46.250]  I looked at a video I'll post. You know what? Fuck you. I'll go to the icky shuffle video I saw.
[01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:52.850]  But you know what's really interesting about this? None of them are called sewing machine.
[01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:56.570]  It's true. It's repeating back what I was told it was called.
[01:12:56.810 --> 01:13:01.570]  OK, you know what? This isn't even better. Eric, your bullshit icky shuffle video.
[01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.190]  This is a person that knows how to sew a machine.
[01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:07.250]  That they do two feet in. This is a good one.
[01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:10.090]  The one I just posted, that's some good sewing machine.
[01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:15.190]  Bam, bam, bam. It's so fast. But it's called the icky shuffle.
[01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:18.930]  But that's not what I call it. That's what I was taught. Sewing machine.
[01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:21.810]  This is... Geoff, do something. Geoff, do anything.
[01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:24.530]  I don't know what to say to that. It's the icky shuffle.
[01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:28.910]  It's the icky fucking shuffle. And it's... I don't know why you called it the sewing machine
[01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.010]  relentlessly. That's what I've been told it was called.
[01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:35.510]  Right. But then when we figured out that that's not what it was called,
[01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.390]  you just keep saying that's what it's called.
[01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:42.970]  Because that's what I was taught it as. And also there are things that have multiple names.
[01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:46.770]  Right. I agree with you that sometimes things have multiple names.
[01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:49.490]  This is apparently not one of those instances.
[01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:53.730]  Where did my tennis instructor... I can't find the other names for it.
[01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:56.750]  Where did my tennis instructor get sewing machine from then?
[01:13:58.090 --> 01:14:02.170]  They just came up with that? I highly doubt it. They all called it sewing machine.
[01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:06.570]  Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl?
[01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:14.470]  Let's do this other icky shuffle. So we cast icky shuffle, the one you posted.
[01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.730]  So, Andrew, are we doing... You said I never had a goldfish.
[01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.650]  Are we doing icky shuffle for $300?
[01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:26.930]  Yeah, I mean, if that's what we're going to call it, I guess. Yeah,
[01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:28.570]  I think I'm really good at the sewing machine.
[01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:31.850]  What if we do the icky shuffle while holding a sewing machine each?
[01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.030]  That seems difficult. That's so fucking stupid.
[01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:38.510]  How did we... How did the podcast get better when we stopped?
[01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:41.230]  Yeah, right. No kidding. It stopped when we stopped.
[01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:45.030]  Oh, no, it got better because we just proved Andrew wrong.
[01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:48.350]  That's all it took. You just had to understand and then go,
[01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:51.910]  well, that's not right. And then he went, no, and but he's wrong.
[01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.930]  Goddamn. Okay, so you shuffle. I just I didn't know that.
[01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.630]  I wasn't trying to be difficult. I didn't know that.
[01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:01.530]  You're saying it's not the before. I'm not hung up on the before, Andrew.
[01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:04.170]  I need you to understand. I need to be like crystal clear.
[01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.910]  I'm not hung up on the before. No, I get what you're saying, Eric.
[01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:12.850]  If you've called something one way for like 16 years of your life,
[01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.590]  it's not an immediate flip. Okay, I'm going to need time.
[01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:18.330]  No, I understand. I can promise you, Eric,
[01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:21.350]  I'm going to make a real effort. I'm going to really try hard to start
[01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.890]  saying icky shuffle for you because it clearly means a lot.
[01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:27.850]  It's kind of tough for me right now, so I'm working towards that point.
[01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:31.650]  So I'm going to need you to have some space for me to say sewing machine.
[01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:36.270]  I'm not giving you, absolutely not. I'm not giving you any space for sewing machine.
[01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:41.130]  In the face of evidence, you just went, some things have two names, right?
[01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.450]  Yeah, because red butt, the name, and then my name.
[01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:49.570]  Yeah, right. The name that everyone knows and a thing I made up.
[01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:53.990]  But I don't, okay. I guess there's no other use as a sewing machine.
[01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:57.110]  And if that's true, then it was just my thing. I apologize.
[01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.090]  I just need some space, Eric.
[01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.170]  I would love to know what other fake names you have for shit.
[01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:07.190]  I don't think I have any other fake names for any other thing.
[01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:08.350]  Oh, God.
[01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:12.570]  I can't find a single instance where it's also called the sewing machine.
[01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:15.090]  I've been Googling the entire time.
[01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:17.270]  You got a tennis message board.
[01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:18.210]  What?
[01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:22.930]  It could be a tennis thing. You got a tennis message board.
[01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.950]  Is it maybe a Russian tennis thing?
[01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:31.770]  It's definitely not a Russian tennis thing.
[01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:33.510]  A sewing machine goes up and down.
[01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:36.750]  Yeah, but it's stitches. It's like a stitch pattern.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:51.200]  I think if we had a sewing machine contest where we, I'm sorry, an icky shuffle contest,
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.020]  I think you would end up like Icky Woods.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.740]  You would be on the disabled list for the rest of your life.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.900]  You are, it is one of my skills.
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.060]  You would suffer a career enduring ankle injury.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:07.280]  No, you would be shocked how good I would do at the icky shuffle.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.800]  I don't think I would.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.740]  I think I would be shocked at how quickly we ended up in the emergency room.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.440]  I think I'd be like, immediately? Not even five minutes in?
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:22.920]  No, it's you're discrediting the amount of icky shuffle work I had done.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.140]  I've never heard of the icky shuffle.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.060]  I can easily do it faster than you.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:32.140]  I just don't know what the fuck to call it now. It's like Voldemort. I'm scared to say anything.
[01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:40.790]  Beat you in the foot race thing we're doing that's not really a race but
[01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.250]  involves feet going in and out of a ladder we may or may not have.
[01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:52.470]  Is it funny if Voldemort, like Voldemort's just a guy? Why is that a thing to...
[01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:54.970]  He's so much more than just a guy.
[01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.750]  He's just a gray-faced guy with no nose.
[01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:00.650]  Yeah, he's got no nose so you can't break it.
[01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:02.970]  The unbreakable nose.
[01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:08.950]  That's interesting. A lot of parallels here.
[01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:10.210]  Can we go now?
[01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:11.990]  Yeah, I'm gonna go away now.
[01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.790]  I'm exhausted.
[01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:15.470]  I feel like I got in a fight.
[01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:23.910]  First episode, awesome. That was the most exhausting thing I've been a part of in a while.
[01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:28.770]  Do another outro right now. An outro to the extra material.
[01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.710]  Nah, for what?
[01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:33.010]  I'm just fascinated.
[01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.070]  Absolutely not.
[01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:37.770]  Just asking.
[01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:40.870]  I don't even know what I'm gonna have for dinner tonight.
[01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:45.450]  Yeah, I'm sitting in a dark room lit by computer screens and I'm hungry.
[01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:46.730]  Yeah, the sun went down.
[01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:51.570]  Oh, that's a great question. What's everybody gonna do for dinner?
[01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:54.150]  Maybe I'll get some ideas.
[01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:55.930]  Andrew, what are you eating for dinner tonight?
[01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:59.850]  I don't know. It's a good call. I live next to so many restaurants.
[01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:03.910]  Maybe Greek and maybe get Greek or Indian.
[01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:05.950]  Maybe like a...
[01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:09.930]  Now, are you gonna risk your ankles to go out and get it?
[01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.910]  Or are you just gonna have something?
[01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:13.630]  No, no, I'm like 90%. My ankles are almost good.
[01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:15.310]  Gavin, what are you gonna have for dinner tonight?
[01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.890]  Pasta.
[01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:19.070]  I've got some ground beef. I'm gonna have some soft tacos.
[01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:21.050]  Eric?
[01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:25.510]  I think I made some crockpot chicken, so I'm gonna make chicken enchiladas.
[01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:27.550]  All right, Nick?
[01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:31.890]  I was snacking on chips and queso during the episode, so I'm good.
[01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:37.550]  Queso! That was the word I was looking for earlier. Is queso a dip, like a condiment?
[01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:38.270]  Yeah.
[01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:42.730]  You didn't end up hungry and alone in the dark?
[01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:44.530]  Yeah, just the rest of us.
[01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:47.990]  No, I'm in the dark. I just ate queso in the dark.
[01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.510]  Yeah.
[01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:51.570]  How are we all... I'm also in the dark.
[01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:52.150]  How are we all in the dark?
[01:19:52.150 --> 01:20:00.870]  Because we started and then we talked about an icky shuffle for 40 minutes.
[01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:06.870]  Can we just put this argument out instead of the episode we made?
[01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:08.510]  Yeah, no kidding. Just do this.
[01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:09.650]  Put it out first.
[01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:14.030]  Here's some bonus content, idiots.
[01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:17.590]  So my options are chips and queso.
[01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.710]  What do you mean your options?
[01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.150]  If I eat off you guys, chicken enchiladas.
[01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.510]  Oh, shit.
[01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.290]  Greek.
[01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:26.410]  If I eat based off what you guys are eating.
[01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:28.230]  Oh, okay. That's not what I thought you said.
[01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:31.430]  Eat off of you, yeah. Or if I physically eat off of your body.
[01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:33.270]  Just go get a slice of pizza.
[01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:37.510]  Go to Homeslice. Go get the sandwich from Homeslice.
[01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:40.070]  Dude, that's what I'm gonna get for dinner tonight. I'm gonna get Homeslice.
[01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:42.230]  The meatball sub from Homeslice is so fucking good.
[01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:43.030]  Yeah, it's fucking great. There you go.
[01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:45.030]  You're welcome, bud.
[01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:46.430]  Thanks, man. I appreciate that.
[01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.930]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.850]  It's just okay.
[01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.070]  It's fucking great.
[01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:50.870]  You're a prick.
[01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:52.870]  Okay, bye.
[01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.610]  Bye, bye.
[01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.010]  I feel like Firehouse is better.
[01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:59.810]  You feel like Firehouse subs is better than the fucking subs at Meatball?
[01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:00.830]  Meatball for Meatball?
[01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:01.230]  Yeah.
[01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:02.590]  Suck my cum.
[01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:04.530]  All right, you live about four miles.
[01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:07.230]  Come over here and suck my dick right now.
[01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:11.570]  Come over and get on your little bike or get your girlfriend to drive you
[01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:13.670]  and come over and suck my fucking dick.
[01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:15.090]  I'll meet you right home.
[01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.990]  Okay.
[01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:18.570]  I don't think I've ever had a meatball.
[01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:20.210]  I'm out. I'm gone.
[01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:21.850]  I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
[01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:24.130]  Goodbye. Goodbye, everyone.
[01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.630]  Bye.
[01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:25.090]  I can't do it.
[01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:27.630]  I gotta go too.
[01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:28.210]  That's enough.
[01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:28.850]  What the hell?
