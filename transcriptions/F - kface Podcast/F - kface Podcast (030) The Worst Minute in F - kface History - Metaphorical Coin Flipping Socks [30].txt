[00:00.460 --> 00:02.640]  This episode is brought to you by Corona.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.420]  When you're on a beach with an ice-cold Corona in hand,
[00:05.640 --> 00:06.860]  how can you not feel centered?
[00:07.080 --> 00:08.980]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[00:09.280 --> 00:12.320]  That's because whether after work, at barbecues or at a bar,
[00:12.540 --> 00:13.940]  with just a squeeze of lime,
[00:14.060 --> 00:16.160]  Corona brings you La Playa mentality.
[00:16.700 --> 00:18.480]  Because while we all want the beach life,
[00:18.780 --> 00:21.000]  paradise doesn't always have palm trees.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.440]  Corona. La Playa awaits.
[00:23.700 --> 00:25.580]  Get yours at ordercorona.com.
[00:25.780 --> 00:26.520]  Relax responsibly.
[00:26.700 --> 00:27.340]  Corona Extra Beer.
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.040]  Imported by Crown Imports Chicago, Illinois.
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.520]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:45.700 --> 00:47.700]  Nothing a little old reboot wouldn't do.
[00:47.840 --> 00:48.620]  Okay, this is me.
[00:48.700 --> 00:49.420]  Jet 1, 2, 3.
[00:49.540 --> 00:50.120]  1, 2, 3.
[00:50.220 --> 00:50.660]  All right, I sunk.
[00:50.980 --> 00:51.520]  What are you sinking?
[00:52.020 --> 00:52.960]  Yeah, what did you sink to?
[00:53.060 --> 00:53.920]  What did you just sink?
[00:54.940 --> 00:56.580]  I've been doing too much Achievement Hunter today.
[00:56.960 --> 00:58.240]  I did some Achievement Hunter today.
[00:58.300 --> 00:59.440]  It's an old Achievement Hunter joke.
[01:00.060 --> 01:01.340]  All right, so here's the thing, boys.
[01:02.040 --> 01:03.580]  We had a false start earlier.
[01:03.820 --> 01:05.220]  It's okay, it wasn't any good anyway.
[01:05.800 --> 01:08.400]  I was being very critical of it in my head as it was happening.
[01:08.740 --> 01:09.640]  Did you save the audio?
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.620]  It was a bad minute.
[01:10.700 --> 01:11.580]  No, no, I didn't save it.
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.320]  I decided I didn't.
[01:12.500 --> 01:13.380]  What is a bad minute?
[01:13.840 --> 01:15.800]  I don't think you can determine a minute is bad.
[01:16.260 --> 01:17.480]  It wasn't crazy entertaining.
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.240]  Hey, Andrew, give us a good minute and go.
[01:20.600 --> 01:23.780]  Well, there's no way I can do a good minute with that amount of pressure.
[01:23.940 --> 01:24.280]  You give us a good minute.
[01:24.280 --> 01:24.920]  Not with that attitude.
[01:25.140 --> 01:26.280]  You've wasted five seconds.
[01:26.460 --> 01:27.720]  Let's get a good 50 seconds.
[01:27.860 --> 01:28.080]  Let's go.
[01:28.100 --> 01:28.780]  What do you want?
[01:28.800 --> 01:29.160]  What do you want?
[01:29.180 --> 01:29.840]  What is a good minute?
[01:30.380 --> 01:31.120]  I could talk about...
[01:31.120 --> 01:32.020]  What do you want me to talk about?
[01:32.140 --> 01:33.340]  I'm asking you for it.
[01:33.520 --> 01:36.320]  Why am I asking you if I'm going to provide you how to make the minute good?
[01:36.700 --> 01:37.740]  You've lost 20 seconds.
[01:37.860 --> 01:39.620]  Let's get a good 40 seconds and go.
[01:39.640 --> 01:43.660]  There's no hope of me recovering from a lost 20 seconds.
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.620]  It's only down from here.
[01:46.280 --> 01:48.240]  Down to a good 30 seconds.
[01:48.380 --> 01:49.380]  Take it away, Andrew.
[01:49.840 --> 01:50.940]  No, I'm just not going to speak.
[01:51.320 --> 01:51.960]  This is a protest.
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.020]  Well, yeah.
[01:57.420 --> 02:02.260]  Geoff, is this a better minute than the minute we lost or what has been...
[02:02.260 --> 02:03.520]  I feel like the other minute was better.
[02:04.340 --> 02:05.980]  Here's how I f***ing faced myself.
[02:05.980 --> 02:10.040]  Uh, I referenced how bad the previous minute was,
[02:10.580 --> 02:17.500]  all but ensuring that you guys created what might be the worst minute in the history of f***face.
[02:18.140 --> 02:18.320]  What?
[02:18.480 --> 02:19.960]  I should have seen that coming.
[02:20.180 --> 02:21.540]  But you're still in that minute.
[02:22.000 --> 02:22.840]  You're a part of it now.
[02:23.180 --> 02:24.500]  There's no way we're still within the minute.
[02:24.500 --> 02:25.180]  It's too little, too late.
[02:25.240 --> 02:26.380]  There's no way we're still in that minute.
[02:26.760 --> 02:26.960]  Really?
[02:27.080 --> 02:28.400]  I hope to God we're not.
[02:28.520 --> 02:29.660]  I would like to put that...
[02:29.660 --> 02:33.880]  I would like to put as much distance between that minute and us as humanly possible.
[02:34.560 --> 02:37.400]  I think technically every second is adding distance.
[02:37.580 --> 02:38.360]  So we're good.
[02:38.580 --> 02:39.900]  It just naturally happens.
[02:40.060 --> 02:43.440]  Have you ever listened to a thing, though, and thought that was a great minute?
[02:43.600 --> 02:46.440]  No first minute of a podcast is that great.
[02:46.700 --> 02:51.680]  We've had some great final minutes, like when you were being attacked by your mic setup.
[02:51.960 --> 02:52.700]  That was gone.
[02:52.780 --> 02:54.360]  That didn't... that was not uploaded.
[02:54.580 --> 02:55.160]  That was deleted.
[02:55.680 --> 02:56.120]  That's true.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.060]  Nobody listened to that.
[02:57.340 --> 03:00.140]  So it's like you're not... you're mentioning something that never happened, essentially.
[03:01.720 --> 03:02.920]  That was a bad burp.
[03:03.340 --> 03:06.580]  If we're going to start judging things, that burp was not great, Geoff.
[03:06.920 --> 03:07.640]  That was a low burp.
[03:07.900 --> 03:09.840]  I wasn't going for... I wasn't trying to break it.
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.780]  Well, I wasn't going for the greatest fucking comedy minute ever.
[03:12.820 --> 03:14.140]  But apparently we're judging that.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.460]  But I was asking for it, Andrew.
[03:15.500 --> 03:17.840]  I didn't say, Geoff, do the best burp right now.
[03:17.920 --> 03:19.300]  That was just a normal burp.
[03:19.380 --> 03:21.800]  Yeah, but he's expecting things for the first minute.
[03:21.920 --> 03:24.060]  You can't just say, have a great first minute.
[03:24.260 --> 03:25.420]  These things just happen.
[03:26.080 --> 03:27.140]  You can't plan for them.
[03:27.680 --> 03:30.540]  You can't just on the spot declare for a fantastic minute.
[03:30.640 --> 03:31.160]  That's ridiculous.
[03:31.160 --> 03:33.280]  What are we at? Like three minutes now?
[03:33.460 --> 03:33.580]  Four?
[03:34.020 --> 03:35.740]  We're almost at five minutes.
[03:35.940 --> 03:38.920]  But to what extent that this five minutes is used, who knows?
[03:39.160 --> 03:41.020]  All right. Well, here's what I want to talk about today.
[03:41.420 --> 03:44.120]  One, I cheated on you guys.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.400]  And I want to apologize.
[03:45.840 --> 03:49.820]  But also, I'm kind of excited about what opportunities lay ahead for us.
[03:50.400 --> 03:57.880]  And two, I need to discuss something that's been bothering me for a very long time that I can't...
[03:58.480 --> 04:01.060]  I've been scared to talk about because I think, A,
[04:01.120 --> 04:02.920]  it's going to make me look incredibly stupid.
[04:03.760 --> 04:06.640]  And B, I think you might... I might be losing...
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.220]  You might think I've lost my mind.
[04:08.400 --> 04:10.020]  Are you selling your car already?
[04:10.440 --> 04:11.940]  No, no, no, no, no, nothing like that.
[04:12.140 --> 04:14.040]  Car's doing great. Car's better than ever.
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.000]  I drove it to get chilaquiles for breakfast today.
[04:18.100 --> 04:19.080]  And it worked like a charm.
[04:19.300 --> 04:20.760]  Got me there. Got me back.
[04:21.120 --> 04:23.160]  Easy lickety split. A++.
[04:23.820 --> 04:26.220]  Yeah, no, the first thing, the easy thing...
[04:26.840 --> 04:29.320]  Well, first off, those are the two things I want to talk about.
[04:29.640 --> 04:32.800]  Cheated on you guys, feel real bad about it, but it also kind of made me excited.
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.480]  And then I think I'm losing my mind, and I need...
[04:36.140 --> 04:38.900]  I don't know why I need to talk to you two idiots about it, but I've decided to.
[04:40.220 --> 04:42.500]  And what do you guys got? Anything?
[04:42.960 --> 04:44.900]  I have, yeah, if we want to...
[04:44.900 --> 04:46.520]  So Cyberpunk just came out.
[04:47.040 --> 04:50.020]  I don't know if you've played it, Gavin. I assume you haven't, Geoff.
[04:50.220 --> 04:51.900]  I played it. I'm about four hours in.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.940]  Really? Okay, that's great.
[04:54.120 --> 04:54.720]  How do you know I've played it?
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.500]  Because you're more of a video game guy to me than Geoff is,
[04:58.600 --> 05:01.640]  so I would have assumed that you would have played it, because it's a massive game.
[05:02.100 --> 05:03.320]  You assumed correct, yes.
[05:04.080 --> 05:08.920]  Okay, well, I played it, and I typically had an interesting experience.
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.580]  So typically, I don't give a shit about character creators,
[05:12.060 --> 05:14.000]  but there's so much excitement around this game,
[05:14.360 --> 05:16.520]  and it seems like it's going to be such a massive game.
[05:16.580 --> 05:18.860]  I thought, I'm going to really invest in this character.
[05:19.260 --> 05:23.600]  I'm going to try to make it as accurate of representation of myself as I can.
[05:23.600 --> 05:26.140]  I'm going to really put the time in, adjust the things.
[05:26.380 --> 05:28.580]  Not a lot of options. I was kind of disappointed.
[05:28.800 --> 05:32.120]  You can do like a million different things, but you have like six choices per thing.
[05:32.300 --> 05:36.020]  I feel like there's not a lot of body options, like you can't set back length.
[05:36.400 --> 05:39.880]  No, back length was not... that was all... yeah, that was obviously disappointing.
[05:40.520 --> 05:44.580]  But anyway, I go through this whole process, and I make a character I'm happy with.
[05:44.660 --> 05:47.120]  It's like the first time I've ever done this with a game where I'm like,
[05:47.320 --> 05:50.160]  I invested time. This is me in this universe.
[05:50.160 --> 05:51.840]  I load up the game.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.440]  The very first fucking thing you do is put your nose back in the place because you broke it.
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.300]  Took me out immediately. I am not that character.
[06:00.620 --> 06:04.840]  My nose would never break. It ruined the immersion instantly.
[06:05.680 --> 06:08.460]  It was such an unexpected thing to ruin it.
[06:08.580 --> 06:11.920]  But it's literally the first option you have when you load that game.
[06:12.660 --> 06:13.320]  Set your nose.
[06:13.540 --> 06:15.460]  You must have picked a different path.
[06:15.900 --> 06:16.340]  Oh, really?
[06:16.700 --> 06:17.340]  I didn't do that.
[06:17.580 --> 06:18.520]  What path did you pick?
[06:18.520 --> 06:20.100]  You didn't fix your broken nose?
[06:20.420 --> 06:23.640]  No, I'm a corpo. I'm a corpo dude.
[06:24.080 --> 06:24.700]  What do you do?
[06:25.660 --> 06:26.900]  Andrew, you picked street kid?
[06:27.140 --> 06:28.020]  Yeah, I picked street kid.
[06:28.200 --> 06:28.940]  I picked street kid.
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.580]  I feel like most people picked nomad or street kid, but I was just feeling a bit businessy.
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.280]  So I just went that path.
[06:35.680 --> 06:39.520]  That's interesting. I didn't even consider that those choices would align differently.
[06:39.780 --> 06:42.180]  So my nose is untouched so far.
[06:42.380 --> 06:46.060]  So I picked the only option in which it would have ruined the immersion for me.
[06:46.060 --> 06:48.220]  Life does not imitate art there.
[06:49.100 --> 06:52.480]  Did you pick a penis length or did you give yourself a vag?
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.480]  I went penis. I just went basic.
[06:55.680 --> 06:57.520]  I didn't put a lot of thought into that process.
[06:57.700 --> 06:59.240]  How about you put middle sized penis?
[06:59.620 --> 07:02.720]  I think so. Yeah, I think I went penis one and then just normal sized balls.
[07:02.940 --> 07:06.980]  You think so? How is penis not like a big decision that you made?
[07:07.320 --> 07:09.600]  I just didn't think it would go into the gameplay that much.
[07:09.900 --> 07:12.880]  You can pick whether your penis is circumcised or uncircumcised.
[07:12.880 --> 07:16.020]  And I think you can pick from three sizes.
[07:16.360 --> 07:17.580]  Yeah, not a lot of options.
[07:17.860 --> 07:21.060]  Well, there's less for the vagina. The options for vagina is vagina.
[07:23.160 --> 07:26.260]  I didn't see any of that shit. I just hit random and went for it.
[07:26.260 --> 07:29.020]  I had no clue when you were talking about the penis thing earlier today.
[07:32.340 --> 07:34.580]  Also, FYI, Andrew sounds like a robot to me.
[07:34.760 --> 07:37.460]  Gavin sounds fine, so I'm having trouble picking up what Andrew's saying.
[07:37.860 --> 07:39.660]  Geoff sounds a little robotic to me.
[07:40.120 --> 07:43.780]  You've sounded like you sounded a bit dog shit this entire recording.
[07:43.900 --> 07:45.000]  You should reboot, maybe.
[07:45.100 --> 07:45.840]  Maybe do another reboot.
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.600]  I don't hear anything.
[07:46.940 --> 07:48.440]  And then we could redo the minute, Geoff.
[07:48.620 --> 07:48.920]  Hello?
[07:49.060 --> 07:50.260]  You can finally get your minute.
[07:50.860 --> 07:54.860]  Hey, it's Eric. If you do reboot, are you going to save the audio or...?
[07:55.280 --> 07:57.140]  I don't know. That's a great question.
[07:57.280 --> 07:57.760]  Is he gone?
[07:58.540 --> 07:58.800]  Geoff?
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.560]  Did Geoff just reboot?
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.580]  Just immediately rebooted?
[08:04.080 --> 08:06.720]  Why does this happen with him so much?
[08:06.720 --> 08:10.560]  It's a bold move to just immediately reboot, or he's just not talking.
[08:10.980 --> 08:15.860]  I think his computer got all messed up.
[08:15.880 --> 08:17.260]  Oh, you think this isn't on purpose?
[08:17.420 --> 08:18.940]  You think he's crashed in some capacity?
[08:18.960 --> 08:19.580]  Do you think it's...?
[08:19.580 --> 08:20.620]  Okay, so how do we make sure?
[08:20.700 --> 08:21.780]  How do we see if it's an on purpose?
[08:23.320 --> 08:25.560]  I guess we ask him when he comes back?
[08:26.140 --> 08:30.280]  I did hear him say a little bit ago, you guys are breaking up.
[08:30.340 --> 08:32.160]  He said that right in the middle of you talking, Andrew,
[08:32.240 --> 08:34.140]  but I feel like we just ignored him.
[08:34.380 --> 08:35.720]  No, I didn't hear that at all.
[08:35.720 --> 08:39.020]  I heard him after say like, Andrew kind of sounds like a robot to me.
[08:39.080 --> 08:40.200]  Oh, wait, no, that's...
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.160]  God damn it.
[08:41.260 --> 08:42.160]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[08:42.260 --> 08:42.600]  I just got...
[08:44.240 --> 08:44.820]  He's here.
[08:46.100 --> 08:47.140]  He said he just got.
[08:47.440 --> 08:48.080]  Can you hear me now?
[08:49.440 --> 08:51.240]  I know, I don't hear Geoff at all.
[08:52.440 --> 08:54.620]  Sorry, Eric, when are we rescheduling the...
[08:54.620 --> 08:55.320]  Yeah, I can...
[08:55.320 --> 08:56.200]  All right, Gavin's fine.
[08:56.720 --> 08:57.220]  Gavin's fine.
[08:58.180 --> 08:59.860]  You want to just call Andrew on the phone?
[09:00.100 --> 09:00.240]  Yeah.
[09:02.520 --> 09:03.540]  Wait, what do you mean?
[09:03.880 --> 09:04.380]  Call me?
[09:05.060 --> 09:06.680]  Well, he's having an issue with you, Andrew.
[09:07.120 --> 09:08.100]  Oh, I can't hear Geoff.
[09:09.500 --> 09:10.620]  Andrew can't hear me?
[09:11.940 --> 09:13.960]  Why wouldn't Andrew and I be able to hear each other?
[09:14.300 --> 09:16.200]  They're just talking over each other now.
[09:16.500 --> 09:18.060]  I have no idea what Geoff's saying.
[09:18.260 --> 09:18.720]  This is...
[09:18.720 --> 09:19.980]  This is like lunacy.
[09:20.200 --> 09:21.040]  This is how...
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.580]  This is how GERPL happened.
[09:23.100 --> 09:24.060]  No, OK, I'm going to...
[09:24.060 --> 09:25.220]  Whenever Geoff's thing...
[09:25.220 --> 09:26.500]  We need to set up an honor system.
[09:26.580 --> 09:28.520]  When Geoff lights up, I'll stop talking.
[09:28.840 --> 09:29.460]  That doesn't...
[09:29.460 --> 09:30.520]  But it's a podcast.
[09:30.540 --> 09:32.300]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it'll be fine.
[09:32.360 --> 09:32.680]  It'll be fine.
[09:32.860 --> 09:33.540]  Gavin will have...
[09:33.540 --> 09:36.360]  It's like a choose-your-own-adventure happening simultaneously.
[09:36.680 --> 09:37.940]  And Gavin is the main character.
[09:38.180 --> 09:39.900]  What, like I gotta pick who I want to listen to?
[09:40.260 --> 09:43.620]  No, we'll just go back and forth and people can decide what path they like.
[09:44.020 --> 09:45.700]  By the way, Andrew sounds fine now.
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.980]  Andrew, can you hear Geoff?
[09:50.420 --> 09:51.400]  Oh, absolutely not.
[09:51.900 --> 09:53.580]  I can hear Andrew sounds...
[09:53.580 --> 09:54.860]  Andrew sounds totally fine to me.
[09:55.080 --> 09:56.460]  Could you see him lighting up, Andrew?
[09:56.680 --> 09:58.180]  Oh, I can see him lighting up.
[09:58.280 --> 09:58.640]  Absolutely.
[09:58.780 --> 09:59.400]  That's how I know.
[09:59.460 --> 10:01.200]  It's like a red light, green light scenario.
[10:01.360 --> 10:03.180]  Whenever I see that light go up, I go quiet.
[10:03.540 --> 10:07.300]  If you want to make Geoff laugh, that's going to be difficult.
[10:07.480 --> 10:09.020]  I feel like that's a big part of this podcast.
[10:09.880 --> 10:10.720]  Oh, he's laughing.
[10:10.860 --> 10:11.400]  Did you hear that, Andrew?
[10:11.720 --> 10:12.420]  No, I didn't.
[10:13.880 --> 10:16.120]  Okay, I'll recite what Geoff's saying.
[10:17.660 --> 10:18.660]  That's what he's saying now.
[10:19.060 --> 10:19.580]  Oh, that's great.
[10:20.020 --> 10:20.560]  That's great.
[10:21.340 --> 10:22.860]  Why can't Andrew just jump...
[10:22.860 --> 10:26.580]  Andrew, just get off the call real quick, quit Skype, open it back up, come back in,
[10:26.620 --> 10:27.220]  but just don't stop recording.
[10:27.220 --> 10:28.520]  What do you mean quit Skype?
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.200]  I'm sorry, Discord.
[10:30.720 --> 10:31.040]  Discord.
[10:31.420 --> 10:32.580]  Why don't we try on Skype?
[10:32.580 --> 10:33.540]  Shut up.
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.620]  I maintain that somehow Andrew's the problem.
[10:38.960 --> 10:40.260]  I'm telling you it's not my fault.
[10:40.580 --> 10:42.580]  Wait, so wait, you can hear Geoff.
[10:43.020 --> 10:43.780]  What do you mean?
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.540]  You just replied to him.
[10:45.840 --> 10:47.720]  This is bullshit, you just replied to him.
[10:47.960 --> 10:48.360]  What do you mean?
[10:48.420 --> 10:49.400]  You did, you did.
[10:49.620 --> 10:50.500]  No, I didn't hear.
[10:50.660 --> 10:51.980]  I just left and came back.
[10:52.080 --> 10:52.780]  I didn't hear anything.
[10:52.960 --> 10:54.760]  I just was declaring it was not my fault.
[10:55.060 --> 10:55.580]  No, I'm not.
[10:55.660 --> 10:56.340]  This isn't a bit.
[10:56.580 --> 10:57.220]  I couldn't hear you.
[10:57.220 --> 10:58.160]  Wait, you were doing a bit.
[10:58.360 --> 10:59.860]  You were doing a fucking bit.
[11:00.080 --> 11:01.020]  No, I wasn't doing a bit.
[11:01.880 --> 11:02.840]  This is no bit.
[11:03.220 --> 11:04.360]  But you can hear him now.
[11:04.700 --> 11:05.600]  Yeah, I can hear him now.
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.520]  You sound great, Geoff.
[11:06.520 --> 11:06.740]  Okay.
[11:07.480 --> 11:08.200]  How's it going, buddy?
[11:08.200 --> 11:08.760]  I missed you.
[11:09.080 --> 11:09.820]  I missed you too.
[11:09.940 --> 11:13.000]  So, you picked the street guy.
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.000]  And your nose got broken after you've broke it.
[11:18.320 --> 11:19.400]  Or your nose got fixed.
[11:19.580 --> 11:20.520]  And then Gavin's a corpo.
[11:20.620 --> 11:21.520]  What's it like being a corpo?
[11:21.740 --> 11:23.000]  That seemed like the lamest one.
[11:23.300 --> 11:25.280]  Yeah, it felt like the lamest one.
[11:25.920 --> 11:27.840]  Starting at the top and going downhill from there.
[11:27.960 --> 11:29.560]  But I just wanted to see all the shiny.
[11:29.560 --> 11:32.000]  And that seemed like the shiniest option to me.
[11:32.160 --> 11:33.920]  Wait, what do you mean, see all the shiny?
[11:33.920 --> 11:34.520]  Yeah, you're fucking kidding me.
[11:34.620 --> 11:35.880]  Like, it's shiny windows.
[11:36.160 --> 11:38.840]  Like, rich people, metallic floors and stuff.
[11:38.920 --> 11:40.120]  It seemed all shiny-like.
[11:40.200 --> 11:40.720]  Well, now I've lost everybody.
[11:40.720 --> 11:41.940]  But it's an open world game.
[11:42.020 --> 11:43.180]  Clearly, you'd get there eventually.
[11:43.500 --> 11:44.700]  Isn't the whole world shiny?
[11:44.880 --> 11:46.220]  Like, you don't get your own area.
[11:46.540 --> 11:46.880]  I don't know.
[11:46.940 --> 11:48.460]  I had just something about starting in the dust.
[11:48.580 --> 11:49.520]  Didn't feel like doing it.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.160]  I like the idea that they propose...
[11:52.160 --> 11:55.180]  Like, they say, hey, if you pick this choice, this is your life.
[11:55.240 --> 11:57.040]  If you pick this choice, this is your life.
[11:57.040 --> 11:59.620]  And your determination was just, what's the shiniest?
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.600]  You gave no fucks about any of the other options.
[12:03.200 --> 12:06.780]  I wanted to see the ray tracing and the puddles and stuff.
[12:07.140 --> 12:07.740]  That's fair.
[12:08.140 --> 12:09.800]  If you put it in that context, I get it.
[12:09.860 --> 12:10.500]  I'm going to fix this.
[12:10.620 --> 12:11.060]  I'll be right back.
[12:13.320 --> 12:14.720]  We've got like two minutes.
[12:14.720 --> 12:15.340]  What happened?
[12:15.660 --> 12:16.180]  What are we doing?
[12:16.180 --> 12:17.680]  No, I think this is all good.
[12:17.980 --> 12:19.000]  What is Geoff doing?
[12:19.460 --> 12:20.760]  I told you this isn't my fault.
[12:21.600 --> 12:24.140]  I told you it wasn't my fault and that it is his.
[12:24.360 --> 12:25.660]  And I wasn't doing a bit.
[12:25.660 --> 12:29.540]  Maybe while Geoff's gone, we can have a few updates on last week's recording.
[12:29.860 --> 12:31.000]  Or the week before.
[12:31.280 --> 12:33.140]  I mean, I guess they're the same day for us.
[12:33.700 --> 12:35.920]  Andrew, has your salad cream arrived?
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.620]  No, it's following the thank us later model.
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.280]  It's not expected to arrive until December 26th to like January something.
[12:45.800 --> 12:46.080]  Oh, wow.
[12:46.080 --> 12:46.840]  It's going to be a while.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.240]  Might be a Boxing Day treat.
[12:48.700 --> 12:49.020]  It might.
[12:49.160 --> 12:50.620]  I don't know if I want to call it a treat.
[12:50.940 --> 12:52.640]  I learned I accidentally ordered two.
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.220]  I ordered an allotment of two and I'm disgusted to even have one.
[12:56.320 --> 12:57.100]  I regret it.
[12:57.200 --> 12:57.340]  Why?
[12:57.700 --> 13:01.460]  I don't like anything about it.
[13:01.900 --> 13:04.400]  I know it's not the most outrageous thing,
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.800]  but the idea of using a Heinz bottle to put anything on a salad seems absurd.
[13:09.240 --> 13:10.760]  Just seems like it would be a bad idea.
[13:11.720 --> 13:15.040]  I don't want to use a Heinz bottle on anything green.
[13:15.420 --> 13:19.200]  That makes no sense because so much stuff of Heinz you put on green stuff.
[13:19.400 --> 13:19.840]  Like what?
[13:20.640 --> 13:21.100]  Name something.
[13:21.100 --> 13:21.300]  Uh.
[13:24.000 --> 13:24.720]  Fucking exactly.
[13:25.100 --> 13:26.740]  Do Heinz make a mayonnaise?
[13:27.400 --> 13:29.780]  Yeah, they do, I guess, but not in like a bottle, I don't think.
[13:30.580 --> 13:32.820]  You wouldn't want a squeeze bottle for mayonnaise, would you?
[13:32.840 --> 13:35.200]  I feel like mayonnaise is a knife condiment.
[13:35.460 --> 13:37.300]  No, I've got a squeeze bottle for mayo.
[13:37.580 --> 13:37.940]  Really?
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.140]  And it's an upside down one too.
[13:39.460 --> 13:39.620]  Hello?
[13:40.860 --> 13:41.800]  I'm not a mayo guy.
[13:41.860 --> 13:43.800]  As I said, I'm a sneaky mayo eater.
[13:44.180 --> 13:45.460]  I'll never put it on anything.
[13:45.780 --> 13:49.640]  I kind of don't like the idea of eating it, but if it's on an item I order,
[13:49.640 --> 13:52.020]  I won't take it off and I'll probably enjoy it.
[13:52.020 --> 13:54.340]  Wow, Heinz make dressings too.
[13:54.920 --> 13:55.660]  As a spray.
[13:57.020 --> 13:58.160]  What do you mean a spray?
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.000]  What the fuck?
[14:00.100 --> 14:01.280]  They got spray bottles.
[14:01.460 --> 14:06.980]  I'm looking at Heinz balsamic with a hint of garlic, Heinz raspberry balsamic,
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.560]  chili and lime, and zesty lemon salad dressing spray.
[14:12.080 --> 14:13.900]  Oh, it really is salad dressing spray, yeah.
[14:14.220 --> 14:14.420]  Hello?
[14:14.620 --> 14:15.360]  That's amazing.
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.220]  And that's going all over your green stuff, Andrew.
[14:17.700 --> 14:18.400]  Yeah, that's true.
[14:18.400 --> 14:20.620]  I guess, you know, I was considering...
[14:20.620 --> 14:22.240]  Oh, that's not what I imagined that.
[14:23.380 --> 14:25.560]  I guess, I mean, the bottle technology exists.
[14:25.660 --> 14:26.720]  Why wouldn't Heinz use it?
[14:27.040 --> 14:27.420]  Leading company.
[14:27.420 --> 14:29.180]  I think more food should be sprayed on.
[14:29.760 --> 14:30.340]  Like, right?
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.200]  What do you mean?
[14:31.580 --> 14:32.520]  This is gonna work.
[14:33.160 --> 14:33.360]  We're good.
[14:33.960 --> 14:35.040]  What do you mean this is gonna work?
[14:35.080 --> 14:35.640]  What did you do?
[14:36.120 --> 14:37.020]  I just rebooted my internet.
[14:37.440 --> 14:37.760]  Okay.
[14:38.100 --> 14:39.220]  You're not on Wi-Fi, are you?
[14:39.440 --> 14:40.380]  Well, here's the problem.
[14:40.620 --> 14:46.180]  I am, unfortunately, because I'm in my bedroom and I can't run a Cat5 cable that far.
[14:46.220 --> 14:48.220]  Your bedroom has all the shelves in it, or...?
[14:48.220 --> 14:49.620]  No, the library has the shelves.
[14:49.860 --> 14:51.760]  It's... listen, library's still getting work done.
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.760]  I had somebody here today.
[14:53.260 --> 14:54.000]  Who's that, me?
[14:54.080 --> 14:56.140]  I don't want to get into a whole thing.
[14:56.220 --> 14:56.460]  Okay.
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.460]  But because people gave me the order wrong to get shit done because people...
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.040]  Everybody's well-meaning, but motherfucker, I just...
[15:04.040 --> 15:06.120]  I got the wallpaper in.
[15:06.160 --> 15:09.640]  I got the wallpaper in two weeks ago or last week, however long ago it was.
[15:09.820 --> 15:10.360]  I don't remember.
[15:10.460 --> 15:11.760]  Do you remember when I got the wallpaper in?
[15:11.840 --> 15:13.920]  It was a fucking eternity ago, I'll tell you that.
[15:14.300 --> 15:17.640]  And today, the guy comes in to look at the support for the desk
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.920]  because the desk needs a support, needs a metal beam on it,
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.040]  otherwise the fucking desk isn't gonna be strong enough
[15:22.040 --> 15:25.400]  and my fucking monitors are all gonna crash into each other like Jeremy's ass kick.
[15:25.760 --> 15:28.980]  And he goes, oh, it's too bad about the wallpaper.
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.440]  We're gonna have to rip all that up.
[15:33.280 --> 15:35.420]  I didn't even think I was gonna have to talk about this today
[15:35.420 --> 15:40.300]  because I agreed after this morning that I wasn't gonna think about it for a while
[15:40.300 --> 15:43.220]  because I was frustrated and then you guys drug it out of me
[15:43.220 --> 15:45.580]  because I realized I'm on fucking Wi-Fi in the bedroom.
[15:45.580 --> 15:47.100]  But it shouldn't be a problem, guys,
[15:47.280 --> 15:50.380]  because I've been on Wi-Fi in the bedroom for like the last five fucking episodes
[15:50.380 --> 15:53.660]  because this library's never gonna get finished!
[15:53.900 --> 15:54.860]  Here's the thing as well, though.
[15:54.920 --> 15:59.780]  You could just spend about eight bucks on just a long Cat5 cable.
[16:00.060 --> 16:00.540]  That's true.
[16:00.540 --> 16:01.260]  And just use it for a bit.
[16:01.480 --> 16:03.100]  And then bung it in a cupboard when you're done.
[16:03.380 --> 16:06.860]  The best thing I can do is if I get a 50-foot Cat5 cable,
[16:06.960 --> 16:12.360]  I could run it out the library window and then into the sliding glass door in my bedroom, I think.
[16:12.540 --> 16:15.160]  But it hasn't been, I considered that just now.
[16:15.160 --> 16:18.520]  However, it hasn't been a fucking issue for the last five episodes.
[16:18.740 --> 16:20.120]  So why would it be one today?
[16:20.260 --> 16:22.380]  It's a sunny day outside. There's no bad weather.
[16:22.560 --> 16:24.440]  Internet should be great. I love it.
[16:24.700 --> 16:26.700]  So in order to prop up your desk,
[16:27.140 --> 16:30.400]  I assume it would just be like a leg under the desk or something.
[16:30.600 --> 16:31.940]  They're ripping down all the wallpaper.
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.380]  I don't want a leg to like bang my knee into.
[16:35.960 --> 16:37.240]  It'd have to be like in the middle.
[16:37.560 --> 16:40.620]  And so they're going to build like a metal L beam
[16:40.620 --> 16:42.780]  that's going to go into the stud and come out,
[16:43.140 --> 16:44.900]  which is the elegant solution.
[16:44.900 --> 16:46.760]  And the right way to do it, to build it properly.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.140]  However, that's going to require them to rip out the sheet rock
[16:51.200 --> 16:55.740]  that I just had, that they just had me get re-sheet rocked.
[16:57.620 --> 16:59.020]  So who's in charge of the order?
[16:59.140 --> 17:01.400]  Is there like a project manager who should be arranging that?
[17:01.480 --> 17:01.920]  Or is that you?
[17:02.020 --> 17:03.280]  That's the problem.
[17:04.260 --> 17:07.560]  It's, listen, a lot of lessons learned on this library.
[17:07.740 --> 17:09.220]  It's going to be fucking beautiful.
[17:09.480 --> 17:10.400]  It's going to be wonderful.
[17:10.460 --> 17:11.280]  It's going to be amazing.
[17:11.280 --> 17:15.280]  Tomorrow, I'm going to have drawer pulls on all of my drawers
[17:15.280 --> 17:17.400]  and I'm going to be able to start using them.
[17:17.680 --> 17:19.940]  I'm going to have a light installed where I need a light installed.
[17:20.060 --> 17:21.000]  That's going to be great too.
[17:21.200 --> 17:24.860]  I'm going to be, I'm going to have 30% less wallpaper than I have today,
[17:24.980 --> 17:27.120]  but I'll deal with that problem tomorrow.
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.220]  Well, you missed us talking about Heinz salad dressing spray,
[17:33.460 --> 17:36.140]  but I don't think you really missed out on too much there.
[17:36.420 --> 17:37.780]  No, it was kind of interesting.
[17:37.920 --> 17:38.900]  It was mildly interesting.
[17:38.900 --> 17:42.300]  That's a whole thing, that salad dress dressing shit.
[17:42.540 --> 17:44.140]  Have you experienced that? Have you used that?
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.260]  Nah, dude, it looks gross as all hell.
[17:46.600 --> 17:49.560]  What do you mean that it's a whole thing? What is that based off of?
[17:49.580 --> 17:52.300]  I just be getting it. We've been getting a ton of fucking tweets about
[17:53.960 --> 17:56.620]  salad dressing sprays and creams and whatever.
[17:56.840 --> 17:58.780]  You already knew about the sprays before I just looked it up?
[17:59.120 --> 18:01.340]  The salad dressing spray? I thought we were talking about the thing from the other day.
[18:01.720 --> 18:01.900]  No.
[18:02.080 --> 18:03.280]  The salad cream. Look in the discord.
[18:03.720 --> 18:04.440]  Oh, hold on.
[18:04.920 --> 18:08.780]  It's like a balsamic with garlic. I guess they're, well, no, half of them.
[18:08.780 --> 18:11.740]  Well, why? Why do you need that?
[18:12.200 --> 18:15.000]  Andrew said he didn't want to put Heinz on anything green.
[18:15.520 --> 18:18.300]  So I found some good examples of stuff that goes on green.
[18:18.500 --> 18:20.740]  Dude, I bet that raspberry balsamic is good.
[18:20.860 --> 18:26.560]  All right, Gavin, you can only have one of those four salad dressing sprays
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.140]  for the rest of your life. You're using it on every salad you have.
[18:29.180 --> 18:29.780]  Which one do you pick?
[18:29.900 --> 18:32.700]  I think I'll just pick classic balsamic with a hint of garlic.
[18:32.920 --> 18:34.260]  Yeah. How about you, Andrew? Which one are you going?
[18:34.460 --> 18:36.380]  You're a spicy dude. You're going to do chili and lime?
[18:36.380 --> 18:40.280]  No, no, no. I don't trust Heinz with fruit in the slightest.
[18:40.400 --> 18:41.740]  They're not a fruit company to me.
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.180]  I'd veer away from anything that they're claiming has fruit in it.
[18:45.420 --> 18:46.600]  So I'd have to go with the garlic.
[18:46.600 --> 18:48.700]  What? Heinz stuff has fruit in it, typically.
[18:49.100 --> 18:53.020]  This, this, all three, three of the four of those have a fruit in them.
[18:53.420 --> 18:54.460]  I don't trust the fruit.
[18:55.260 --> 18:56.740]  Isn't tomato technically a fruit?
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.220]  Yeah, I guess technically you're right.
[18:58.300 --> 19:01.020]  But that's a whole nobody considers that's like a weird thing.
[19:01.020 --> 19:03.640]  Like the main, the main Heinz condiment.
[19:03.640 --> 19:04.680]  It's all they use.
[19:04.920 --> 19:09.700]  Yeah, but the tomato fruit thing is very like, oh, I know a lot about tomatoes.
[19:09.920 --> 19:11.720]  I mean, it's technically a fruit, not a vegetable.
[19:11.880 --> 19:12.900]  Like you'd assume it would be.
[19:13.060 --> 19:14.220]  So you're okay with their veg?
[19:14.600 --> 19:16.680]  Yeah, I'm totally fine with the vegetables.
[19:17.140 --> 19:18.020]  So you'd eat their beans?
[19:18.580 --> 19:20.980]  Yeah, the Heinz baked beans, pretty good.
[19:21.180 --> 19:22.320]  You're into their legumes?
[19:22.880 --> 19:24.420]  Yeah, no problem with that.
[19:24.500 --> 19:27.040]  I just don't, where's Heinz getting their lemons from?
[19:27.100 --> 19:27.800]  Or a raspberry.
[19:28.240 --> 19:30.100]  Where the fuck is Heinz getting the raspberries?
[19:30.360 --> 19:33.420]  But why do you care so much about, like, if you eat some chicken soup,
[19:33.420 --> 19:35.020]  you ever think like, where's this?
[19:35.180 --> 19:36.240]  Where did this chicken live?
[19:36.760 --> 19:38.400]  I went actually beyond that, Gavin.
[19:39.020 --> 19:44.180]  I had a realization like a year ago of where's the chicken in the chicken noodle soup?
[19:44.660 --> 19:48.400]  Because the chicken noodle soup I would always get didn't have chicken in it.
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.940]  Okay, so my entire life, so I'm not a big soup guy.
[19:53.020 --> 19:57.500]  But when I get chicken noodle soup, I get it from a company, like in a box.
[19:57.920 --> 20:00.160]  And there was no chicken chunks in that.
[20:00.340 --> 20:01.080]  It was just like a packet.
[20:01.080 --> 20:02.780]  Because you have to add the chicken, probably.
[20:02.780 --> 20:04.740]  So it's just chicken stock, maybe.
[20:05.120 --> 20:05.760]  I guess so.
[20:05.860 --> 20:07.680]  So yeah, anyway, that was my realization.
[20:07.920 --> 20:10.540]  I thought, well, where's the chicken in the chicken noodle soup?
[20:10.760 --> 20:12.780]  And the person I said this to was stunned.
[20:13.220 --> 20:16.520]  I had never heard of putting actual pieces of chicken in the soup.
[20:16.760 --> 20:17.840]  It was something I learned.
[20:18.120 --> 20:21.800]  I've never put chicken in, but I have had chicken noodle soup with chicken in it.
[20:22.160 --> 20:22.860]  Hence the chicken.
[20:23.240 --> 20:24.180]  Yeah, I've never had it.
[20:24.660 --> 20:26.060]  So I thought, is it a broth thing?
[20:26.120 --> 20:27.480]  I guess it must be a broth thing.
[20:27.520 --> 20:30.840]  And then I looked it up and saw that I guess most chicken noodle soup have chicken.
[20:31.320 --> 20:32.280]  Like actual pieces.
[20:32.780 --> 20:35.800]  My dog's screaming, I gotta go.
[20:35.940 --> 20:37.400]  I'll be back in one second.
[20:37.480 --> 20:38.200]  I gotta let her out.
[20:38.380 --> 20:39.440]  Be right back.
[20:39.860 --> 20:40.900]  What are you doing today?
[20:40.940 --> 20:42.120]  Is this for real?
[20:42.460 --> 20:44.660]  Is this a real episode of this show?
[20:44.960 --> 20:50.060]  I'll be honest, if Geoff had done the podcast the same day his shelves were getting put up,
[20:50.140 --> 20:51.840]  it would have been less intrusive than this.
[20:52.240 --> 20:53.840]  A hundred percent.
[20:54.200 --> 20:55.040]  A hundred percent.
[20:55.760 --> 20:59.940]  I'm doing the metadata right now, and I'm just putting in Geoff is hardly in this one, kind of.
[20:59.940 --> 21:04.400]  I was having such a good day, and now I'm all discombobulated.
[21:04.600 --> 21:06.900]  I'm calling salad cream, salad spray.
[21:07.100 --> 21:07.920]  I'm all backwards.
[21:08.120 --> 21:08.920]  I'm fucking...
[21:08.920 --> 21:09.300]  That's alright.
[21:10.560 --> 21:12.420]  Dude, everything fell apart all at once.
[21:12.680 --> 21:14.020]  I listened to the one from two weeks ago.
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.280]  I totally heard the dog fart.
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.080]  It was so loud.
[21:17.120 --> 21:19.580]  I'm not sure if they boosted it, but it was amazing.
[21:19.860 --> 21:21.900]  I got a lot of comments on the dog fart, actually.
[21:22.140 --> 21:23.340]  I got Henry right here next to me.
[21:23.360 --> 21:24.420]  I'm hoping he'll fart again today.
[21:24.520 --> 21:28.600]  It was, I think most people's highlights of that episode was a dog that didn't say anything.
[21:29.940 --> 21:31.420]  They tend to not say anything.
[21:32.560 --> 21:34.220]  What happened to only farts?
[21:34.760 --> 21:35.700]  I was thinking about that.
[21:35.780 --> 21:36.960]  Oh, I just haven't...
[21:36.960 --> 21:38.000]  You know, I'm still...
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.400]  My butthole's still kind of like a dry fart memory right now.
[21:43.780 --> 21:44.560]  Yeah, I just...
[21:44.560 --> 21:46.780]  I'm waiting to get inspired as soon as I do.
[21:47.600 --> 21:51.340]  I actually went through, and I just deleted a bunch of farts out of my phone because I just...
[21:51.340 --> 21:52.660]  I was listening to them, and they were just...
[21:52.660 --> 21:53.640]  I was struggling.
[21:54.260 --> 21:57.420]  You know, you get like a four, and you're just like wishing it's a six.
[21:57.660 --> 21:59.700]  But you can't lie to yourself, so I just...
[21:59.700 --> 22:01.060]  A bunch of them.
[22:01.120 --> 22:03.500]  It adds a lot more pressure when you go in for the record.
[22:03.600 --> 22:04.720]  It does, it does.
[22:05.200 --> 22:06.380]  It really, it's...
[22:06.380 --> 22:08.040]  There's fart anxiety that's real.
[22:08.420 --> 22:08.740]  You're trying to catch...
[22:08.740 --> 22:11.320]  Yeah, we haven't come up with a fart buffer design yet.
[22:11.740 --> 22:13.440]  No, that's still in the works.
[22:14.940 --> 22:16.600]  Could I get my own?
[22:16.660 --> 22:18.400]  Just before we pivot away from sauces.
[22:19.200 --> 22:23.380]  One thing that was very surprising to me, a lot of people had honey mustard in their top three.
[22:23.660 --> 22:24.940]  Most of the time, one or two.
[22:25.260 --> 22:26.660]  Honey mustard's my number one.
[22:26.920 --> 22:27.520]  I love it.
[22:27.520 --> 22:30.120]  I don't feel like a lot of people talk about honey mustard, though.
[22:30.480 --> 22:33.180]  I feel like it's a sleeper, all-time sauce.
[22:33.640 --> 22:35.020]  I just hear honey mustard.
[22:35.680 --> 22:38.680]  My only interaction with it is that I hear it in a list of other sauces,
[22:38.860 --> 22:40.200]  and then I don't pick honey mustard.
[22:40.560 --> 22:41.400]  Why don't you pick it?
[22:41.760 --> 22:42.880]  Because there's always something nicer.
[22:43.400 --> 22:45.560]  No, I think you got to give it another chance.
[22:45.660 --> 22:47.400]  Honey mustard, I think, is the top sauce.
[22:47.820 --> 22:49.980]  I feel like it's like a sauce subset.
[22:50.820 --> 22:52.460]  I'm with Gavin on that one.
[22:52.680 --> 22:56.760]  It's maybe in a certain situation, but if I'm feeling mustard,
[22:56.760 --> 23:03.700]  I'd probably just rather have plain old yellow mustard than a mustard with flourish.
[23:04.160 --> 23:06.540]  Well, if you're putting it on a dog, I don't think you want honey mustard.
[23:06.700 --> 23:09.680]  But for a lot of other items, fries, chicken strips, chicken,
[23:09.800 --> 23:12.520]  a lot of the chicken items, honey mustard, fantastic.
[23:13.200 --> 23:14.460]  I completely disagree.
[23:14.920 --> 23:17.180]  Can I get my own honey mustard?
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.760]  Is there anything blocking me from doing that if I pursued it?
[23:21.020 --> 23:21.680]  What do you mean?
[23:22.080 --> 23:24.800]  You know how every actor has a fucking vodka?
[23:24.800 --> 23:27.860]  Could I get my own honey mustard if I wanted to?
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.900]  Is there anything blocking me from that?
[23:30.420 --> 23:31.380]  I don't think so.
[23:31.420 --> 23:33.440]  Maybe FDA approval.
[23:34.040 --> 23:34.780]  No, I wouldn't.
[23:34.920 --> 23:36.880]  Like, do you think the actors are making vodka?
[23:37.100 --> 23:41.400]  They just find the company that is willing to put their brand on it and they sponsor it.
[23:41.420 --> 23:42.540]  I'd love to have my own honey mustard.
[23:42.600 --> 23:47.700]  What you need to do is put a snazzy little pitch together and then give it to Ryan Reynolds,
[23:47.880 --> 23:49.660]  get him on board, and then you're set.
[23:49.740 --> 23:51.120]  He has 7,000 companies.
[23:51.340 --> 23:52.600]  I tried that, didn't work.
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.120]  I already went that route.
[23:54.120 --> 23:55.780]  Specifically with Ryan Reynolds?
[23:56.160 --> 23:57.480]  Yeah, specifically with Ryan Reynolds.
[23:57.580 --> 23:58.120]  Didn't work.
[23:58.340 --> 23:59.500]  Tried that already, Geoff.
[23:59.880 --> 24:00.980]  You're two months behind.
[24:02.300 --> 24:03.120]  Well, what happened?
[24:03.440 --> 24:03.780]  Nothing.
[24:04.220 --> 24:05.020]  Absolutely nothing.
[24:05.480 --> 24:06.040]  I don't remember.
[24:06.160 --> 24:10.280]  I think I was trying to sell Not the Rooster Teeth store to Ryan Reynolds and I had no reply.
[24:11.660 --> 24:12.140]  Didn't work.
[24:12.140 --> 24:12.700]  Ah, here you go.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.960]  Eric gave you guys some helpful...
[24:14.960 --> 24:16.120]  No, I looked into that, Eric.
[24:16.180 --> 24:17.160]  I don't want to do that.
[24:17.220 --> 24:18.380]  That seems like a lot of work.
[24:18.540 --> 24:19.640]  I just want to put...
[24:19.640 --> 24:20.980]  I want to have a sauce I like.
[24:21.060 --> 24:21.560]  I'll try it.
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.620]  If I don't like it, I wouldn't sign to it.
[24:23.620 --> 24:27.660]  But if I liked it, I'd want to sign it and then support it, endorse it.
[24:27.920 --> 24:28.580]  That's what I want.
[24:28.740 --> 24:32.080]  I want minimal effort, but I want my own honey mustard because I'd love to have that.
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.260]  Who wouldn't want a sauce?
[24:33.840 --> 24:36.720]  No, I think a lot of people are doing that these days, too.
[24:36.840 --> 24:41.180]  Like, I'm pretty sure Action Bronson sells olive oil now, as an example.
[24:41.460 --> 24:44.160]  Yeah, another celebrity and his sauce.
[24:45.140 --> 24:47.560]  Because I haven't really heard of many sauce celebrities.
[24:47.780 --> 24:49.700]  Action Bronson is a really natural fit, though.
[24:49.860 --> 24:50.460]  That makes sense.
[24:50.820 --> 24:51.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:51.160 --> 24:52.040]  I support that idea.
[24:52.040 --> 24:55.620]  You could start a source and call it F*** Face That's Delicious.
[25:00.700 --> 25:04.100]  I feel like the mustache photo would work really good on a sauce, too.
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.140]  Like the old lady for Frank's Red Hot.
[25:07.440 --> 25:10.660]  Like, I feel like it's just like a good branding face.
[25:11.900 --> 25:12.940]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[25:13.300 --> 25:14.160]  I totally agree.
[25:15.780 --> 25:16.960]  I'm all about it, dude.
[25:17.020 --> 25:17.920]  Tell me how to invest.
[25:18.440 --> 25:19.400]  You need to come up with...
[25:19.400 --> 25:20.180]  You need to start...
[25:20.180 --> 25:21.720]  You need to get in the lab.
[25:22.240 --> 25:23.040]  Like Eminem.
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.200]  And you need to start mixing some shit together and figuring out your ratios.
[25:26.280 --> 25:27.660]  Do you know how to make honey mustard?
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.400]  Oh, OK.
[25:29.620 --> 25:33.880]  So if we were going to make honey mustard, I guess the first thing I think I'd...
[25:33.880 --> 25:35.880]  Well, I would need mustard and mayo.
[25:36.060 --> 25:36.620]  Or not mayo.
[25:36.920 --> 25:37.740]  Honey, right?
[25:38.960 --> 25:39.360]  Mayo.
[25:39.480 --> 25:41.800]  Well, wait, mayo is in mustard, isn't it?
[25:42.300 --> 25:42.720]  Do you cut?
[25:42.820 --> 25:43.360]  Do you use honey?
[25:43.920 --> 25:46.020]  I think there's mayo somewhere in the honey mustard.
[25:48.400 --> 25:49.140]  I don't know.
[25:49.140 --> 25:53.260]  But the fact that you got one of the two ingredients wrong is in the name.
[25:55.640 --> 25:56.860]  It was a misstep.
[25:57.180 --> 26:01.400]  I'm looking at these Heinz balsamic things and they're making me think of mayo because
[26:01.400 --> 26:02.880]  that's how the conversation started.
[26:03.040 --> 26:05.020]  Sounds like you're making mayo mustard and that's your sauce.
[26:05.120 --> 26:05.940]  No, no, no.
[26:06.100 --> 26:06.900]  I'd get...
[26:06.900 --> 26:08.320]  I think I'd go half and half.
[26:08.880 --> 26:11.020]  Half a thing of honey, half a thing of mustard.
[26:11.400 --> 26:12.720]  And then you just stir it.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.140]  I don't want to do any of that, though.
[26:14.180 --> 26:15.920]  Once again, I'm not trying to make honey mustard.
[26:15.920 --> 26:19.760]  I want an established honey mustard to then brand.
[26:20.320 --> 26:21.600]  You want something like...
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.160]  So Achievement Hunter has coffee, right?
[26:24.320 --> 26:24.720]  King's Coffee.
[26:25.200 --> 26:25.780]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.740]  And that guy Wayne, lovely dude, he flew down from New York with a bunch of different coffees
[26:31.740 --> 26:32.980]  and he says, pick out what you like.
[26:33.060 --> 26:35.340]  And you put two or three together and you go like this one, this one, this one.
[26:35.360 --> 26:36.340]  And he goes like, all right, cool.
[26:36.780 --> 26:37.880]  And you're like, and I like that.
[26:37.900 --> 26:39.120]  And he goes, no, you don't.
[26:39.200 --> 26:40.080]  And you're like, oh, I don't.
[26:40.100 --> 26:41.180]  And he's like, no, you don't like that.
[26:41.220 --> 26:41.760]  And you're like, okay.
[26:41.820 --> 26:43.720]  And then he puts it together and he goes, doesn't this taste good?
[26:43.820 --> 26:44.860]  And you're like, I helped.
[26:44.860 --> 26:45.520]  Yeah.
[26:45.860 --> 26:46.740]  Yeah, that's what I want.
[26:47.080 --> 26:48.620]  Yeah. Andrew, you're right there.
[26:48.820 --> 26:54.940]  It seems to be mayonnaise, honey, mustard, lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
[26:55.220 --> 26:57.760]  So I nailed the top three ingredients and you're laughing at me.
[26:57.760 --> 26:58.000]  You did.
[26:58.180 --> 27:01.300]  I was laughing because it sounded like you were wrong when in fact,
[27:01.780 --> 27:03.540]  like a lot of the time, you were absolutely correct.
[27:03.640 --> 27:04.360]  That happens a lot.
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.500]  The ice cream thing I was right about, the ketchup thing is debatable.
[27:08.060 --> 27:09.880]  My record is way better than it appears.
[27:10.620 --> 27:14.680]  I wonder, I know you don't want to do the hard work, but I bet
[27:15.660 --> 27:18.060]  there's somebody on your little giant island
[27:18.060 --> 27:22.600]  who has bees that you could get local honey from, and that could be your angle.
[27:23.160 --> 27:26.840]  Oh, I lost Geoff. I don't know if that's just me.
[27:27.220 --> 27:28.100]  Did Geoff go again?
[27:28.320 --> 27:29.540]  I think Geoff's gone again.
[27:29.780 --> 27:31.020]  He's talking about bees.
[27:31.640 --> 27:33.100]  You guys can't hear me. Can you hear me now?
[27:33.480 --> 27:35.200]  No, no, no. You're back. You're talking about bees.
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.100]  No, I was saying that, uh...
[27:46.060 --> 27:46.880]  Is that why you're laughing?
[27:47.620 --> 27:50.100]  Geoff, why did you repeat the whole point?
[27:50.280 --> 27:50.920]  No, Geoff.
[27:50.920 --> 27:53.360]  You repeated the whole thing.
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.760]  Get a wire and run it to your...
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.300]  Just run the wire out of the office, out of the window.
[28:00.300 --> 28:01.680]  Everything is wrong with Nick.
[28:02.400 --> 28:03.180]  Geoff set up Nick.
[28:03.300 --> 28:08.760]  Yeah, Nick, Geoff is on Wi-Fi because his office still isn't done.
[28:09.240 --> 28:11.660]  And it's about to be undone a little bit as well.
[28:11.780 --> 28:14.160]  And he went on this whole rant about how, like,
[28:14.180 --> 28:16.860]  we drug out him having to talk about his office.
[28:17.240 --> 28:19.580]  Literally, all that was said was, are you on Wi-Fi?
[28:19.580 --> 28:21.060]  What is going on?
[28:21.540 --> 28:25.140]  There is no lead-in. There is no psychological techniques to bring this out of him.
[28:25.400 --> 28:28.460]  One question. Are you on Wi-Fi? And then he fell apart.
[28:28.820 --> 28:31.440]  I believe Andrew. Are you a good chef? Are you good at cooking?
[28:31.920 --> 28:35.420]  Yeah, I'm actually... I think I'm surprisingly good. I don't think you'd assume.
[28:35.420 --> 28:37.120]  What's your go-to dish that you...
[28:37.120 --> 28:42.700]  I'm a big chicken parmesan guy. Absolutely. Great chicken parmesan.
[28:43.080 --> 28:45.340]  Yeah, a lot of grilling. What about you? Are you a chef?
[28:45.340 --> 28:50.040]  No, I don't... Honestly, just not having a ton of time usually.
[28:50.280 --> 28:53.960]  I just cook really quick stuff. Stuff that takes less than an hour.
[28:54.100 --> 28:57.240]  Or, like, less than 40 minutes. A lot of pasta things.
[28:57.860 --> 29:01.560]  And if I can eat it straight out of the pot I cooked it in, bonus. No washing up.
[29:01.560 --> 29:04.120]  Oh, yeah. It's the absolute best.
[29:04.460 --> 29:04.700]  Yeah.
[29:05.320 --> 29:09.520]  I had a sad... I have a sad update about my cooking, my cooking life.
[29:09.840 --> 29:11.180]  My cooking life has changed, Gavin.
[29:11.580 --> 29:12.020]  Is it waffle based?
[29:12.020 --> 29:14.360]  Dreams have died. It's waffle based.
[29:14.360 --> 29:17.660]  It's not just waffle based. It's everything based.
[29:17.860 --> 29:21.120]  It's the waffle. It's the, I guess, closet dogs.
[29:21.540 --> 29:24.360]  I've still been doing the closet dogs. Oh, there he is, Geoff.
[29:24.360 --> 29:29.400]  I thought you did closet dogs in order to not set off the fire detectors one time.
[29:29.420 --> 29:34.740]  Yeah, but once I established that the closet worked, it became the home of the dog maker.
[29:34.860 --> 29:39.380]  So I guess it's closet dogs. I wanted desk dogs, so it's just the closet dog machine.
[29:39.660 --> 29:41.700]  Do you have, like, a little table in there or something?
[29:41.800 --> 29:42.940]  Or are you just doing this on the floor?
[29:43.520 --> 29:46.060]  It's the floor. It's just you got a nice floor set up.
[29:46.080 --> 29:47.600]  So you get in your closet, you close the doors,
[29:47.760 --> 29:51.400]  you hunch over the floor toaster, and you make your dogs.
[29:51.880 --> 29:57.040]  I lift the toaster up. I don't hunch. I feel like saying that I hunch to put the dogs in is,
[29:57.260 --> 29:58.420]  it's a worse image.
[29:58.660 --> 29:59.360]  Wait, so you're...
[29:59.360 --> 29:59.720]  So I lift the machine.
[29:59.880 --> 30:01.820]  You're holding the toaster.
[30:02.260 --> 30:05.700]  I elevate the toaster to put the dogs in, then I put it down.
[30:06.360 --> 30:06.760]  Hello?
[30:07.040 --> 30:09.420]  Then we get the dogs cooking. Geoff's back once again.
[30:09.440 --> 30:10.280]  Hey, what's up, Geoff? Where did you guys go?
[30:10.660 --> 30:11.820]  What do you mean? Where did you go?
[30:11.820 --> 30:16.640]  I don't know. I ran to try to... the 25-foot cable's not long enough, unfortunately.
[30:18.020 --> 30:21.200]  But I tried. Man, I don't know what kind of episode this is.
[30:21.420 --> 30:24.080]  What I was trying to say is surely there's somebody on your island...
[30:24.580 --> 30:25.540]  Back to the bees?
[30:25.780 --> 30:28.720]  There's somebody on your island who has bees and makes honey.
[30:28.940 --> 30:31.620]  And then if you know an old Canadian mustard recipe,
[30:31.780 --> 30:35.020]  I don't know if you guys are famous for your mustards, you can probably...
[30:35.760 --> 30:40.660]  I think if you put a little bit of work into it, it would pay off huge dividends.
[30:40.660 --> 30:41.140]  Here's the problem.
[30:41.540 --> 30:44.120]  Because I love what you're saying, Geoff.
[30:44.180 --> 30:46.620]  I've even considered getting into making my own honey.
[30:46.780 --> 30:48.860]  I've thought about it. I've looked into what I would need.
[30:49.800 --> 30:53.560]  Selling... you can't sell sauces that you make in your own home.
[30:54.260 --> 30:55.580]  So the selling is the problem.
[30:55.760 --> 30:56.080]  Why not?
[30:56.160 --> 30:57.280]  Well, make it in somebody else's home.
[30:57.520 --> 31:01.320]  Well, no, I think it's a whole thing.
[31:01.400 --> 31:06.020]  And then you need to send the recipe off for approval for them to do calorie analysis or
[31:06.020 --> 31:06.300]  something.
[31:06.480 --> 31:06.660]  What if it's secret?
[31:06.660 --> 31:08.580]  It seemed like a lot of busy...
[31:08.580 --> 31:10.920]  Nah, it can't be secret. Then how am I going to sell?
[31:10.920 --> 31:12.700]  You can't produce it in your home?
[31:13.120 --> 31:17.060]  You can't produce it and sell it. This was a U.S. article. It said certain states will
[31:17.060 --> 31:19.480]  allow it within small amounts, but generally, no.
[31:19.800 --> 31:22.280]  You cannot sell something that you produced in your own home.
[31:22.580 --> 31:24.340]  From my understanding of one search.
[31:24.640 --> 31:27.160]  Is that because you'd technically be naked in the same room
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.500]  or the same place that you're making your sauce?
[31:29.920 --> 31:31.940]  I don't think that's the consideration, no.
[31:32.300 --> 31:34.760]  What if you live in a mustard factory?
[31:35.340 --> 31:37.940]  That's a great point. I don't know. You should ask them, Geoff.
[31:38.460 --> 31:39.500]  I'm not setting the rules.
[31:39.500 --> 31:42.520]  All right. I got you. You want to do it with little effort.
[31:42.720 --> 31:44.440]  You want as little effort.
[31:44.580 --> 31:48.880]  I looked at maximum effort, though, just for the record.
[31:49.020 --> 31:50.580]  I did look into making my own sauce.
[31:50.880 --> 31:54.540]  There's laws preventing that from being a thing.
[31:54.800 --> 31:56.700]  Is syrup technically a sauce?
[31:57.220 --> 32:00.640]  I think that was a conversation I had yesterday. Syrup, absolutely a condiment.
[32:00.860 --> 32:05.620]  I think if you can get it at a fast food place in a container, you're good.
[32:05.800 --> 32:08.000]  Or a packet. That's definitely a condiment.
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.000]  If somebody can come up to you and ask if they can have it off of your table
[32:12.460 --> 32:14.600]  because they need it, it's a condiment.
[32:14.860 --> 32:17.800]  Absolutely. And not all condiments apply to that.
[32:17.940 --> 32:20.260]  But if it is that, it's absolutely a condiment.
[32:20.660 --> 32:23.020]  So if you're unsure, it's an easy rule of thumb.
[32:23.800 --> 32:24.260]  It's a condiment.
[32:24.460 --> 32:25.400]  What about peanut butter?
[32:25.900 --> 32:27.060]  Peanut butter is a condiment.
[32:28.500 --> 32:29.900]  Peanut butter is a main ingredient.
[32:30.520 --> 32:33.400]  No, you would call peanut butter an ingredient more than a condiment?
[32:34.140 --> 32:36.100]  It's not called a jelly sandwich.
[32:36.100 --> 32:38.540]  Do you want to throw some peanut butter on it as a condiment?
[32:38.940 --> 32:41.820]  It's at the number one in the title. Peanut butter and jelly.
[32:41.820 --> 32:44.380]  Yeah, but I don't start a sandwich with the peanut butter.
[32:44.720 --> 32:47.760]  It goes on top of the bread. The bread is the constant.
[32:48.140 --> 32:51.580]  That's like saying the bread is the constant in a ham sandwich.
[32:51.920 --> 32:52.840]  Ham's not a condiment.
[32:53.540 --> 32:54.620]  So the ham is the condiment?
[32:56.760 --> 32:59.700]  No, I don't think... that's actually interesting.
[33:00.380 --> 33:03.040]  It is a weird line of like, is a spread a condiment?
[33:03.480 --> 33:05.560]  I think it's situational, right?
[33:05.560 --> 33:09.800]  If you go to a Denny's, and there's breakfast there,
[33:09.900 --> 33:12.980]  and they have those little packets of grape jelly, that's a condiment.
[33:13.300 --> 33:16.020]  But if you're going to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
[33:16.220 --> 33:19.800]  where it's one of the two ingredients mentioned, and it is the star,
[33:20.100 --> 33:23.380]  then it's no longer in the realm of condiment. It is the main attraction.
[33:23.680 --> 33:24.880]  Can you get a ham spread?
[33:25.560 --> 33:26.380]  No, I don't think so.
[33:26.580 --> 33:28.600]  Yeah, it's called spam. You absolutely can. Spam.
[33:28.720 --> 33:30.620]  What about pate? That would be...
[33:32.220 --> 33:33.480]  We're back in the ham zone.
[33:33.480 --> 33:36.380]  When did we turn into a... oh yeah, we're back in the ham zone.
[33:37.060 --> 33:39.120]  When did we turn into a food podcast?
[33:39.700 --> 33:42.780]  When your internet broke, and you're running back and forth,
[33:42.880 --> 33:44.780]  and you're not here for 80% of the episode.
[33:45.220 --> 33:46.900]  Somewhere in that space.
[33:47.460 --> 33:48.260]  So glad that happened.
[33:48.820 --> 33:50.920]  By the way, out of the blue, I mean,
[33:51.220 --> 33:53.840]  I recorded for over an hour with Achievement Hunter this morning.
[33:54.020 --> 33:55.780]  No problems whatsoever. Totally fine.
[33:56.060 --> 33:58.880]  You can't say out of the blue when you have technical difficulties
[33:58.880 --> 34:00.400]  every recording day of your life.
[34:00.420 --> 34:03.000]  I didn't have technical difficulties last week when we recorded.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.020]  Did you not?
[34:04.360 --> 34:05.360]  No. Is that an exception?
[34:05.660 --> 34:06.180]  You did.
[34:06.340 --> 34:08.500]  No, I didn't. I didn't have technical difficulties.
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.820]  I had to do a thing which then put me back because Nick wanted me to record a test.
[34:13.500 --> 34:14.740]  I had no technical difficulties.
[34:16.920 --> 34:19.860]  I do think jelly and peanut butter would be a spread.
[34:20.180 --> 34:20.380]  Yeah.
[34:20.580 --> 34:21.700]  Which would then make it a condiment.
[34:22.040 --> 34:23.260]  I think they're both technically condiments.

[35:58.140 --> 36:00.020]  So here's the thing about HelloFresh.
[36:00.740 --> 36:01.300]  Hello...

[36:18.000 --> 36:19.340]  That's what we in the business say.
[36:20.200 --> 36:22.040]  A lot of people tell you it's cooking.
[36:22.160 --> 36:23.680]  We call it putting the food together.
[36:24.020 --> 36:28.340]  And it's easy to feed the whole family because the prices for larger boxes are super affordable
[36:28.340 --> 36:31.640]  and more servings means more savings.
[36:31.860 --> 36:33.320]  What a clever thing to think.
[36:33.900 --> 36:35.480]  It's also delicious and nutritious.
[36:36.120 --> 36:37.860]  It's super flexible for your lifestyle.
[36:38.020 --> 36:41.580]  For instance, you can change your delivery days or your meal plan preferences.
[36:41.980 --> 36:44.000]  Like if you need to skip a week because you're out of town.
[36:44.480 --> 36:47.500]  I think I said something earlier about it helping you eat more sustainably.
[36:47.640 --> 36:53.480]  That's true because it's actually the very first global carbon-neutral meal kit company.
[36:53.940 --> 36:55.160]  So they got that under their belt.
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.380]  And you can skip the grocery store which means you're reducing your food waste by at least 25%.
[37:00.380 --> 37:05.220]  I know I throw away like for whatever reason it feels like half of everything I buy
[37:05.220 --> 37:08.800]  because I just don't cook smart when I don't use HelloFresh.
[37:09.060 --> 37:18.180]  So go to hellofresh.com slash face80 and use the code face80 to get $80 off including free shipping.

[37:32.200 --> 37:34.920]  And why not have some free shipping while you're at it?
[37:36.260 --> 37:38.120]  Have you planned your marathon yet?
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.360]  I have planned it. I have planned it. I'm gonna need some more time.
[37:44.140 --> 37:46.980]  I'm gonna need some more time for the ankle. A little ambitious.
[37:46.980 --> 37:48.560]  What percent on the ankle are we at?
[37:48.620 --> 37:50.460]  You were at 90% last week. What are you at now?
[37:50.520 --> 37:56.140]  I felt I was at 90% and then I went on like my first kind of distance walk
[37:56.140 --> 37:59.400]  and it wasn't far and I was limping on the way back.
[37:59.700 --> 38:02.380]  Wasn't great. I'm gonna need more time. A few more weeks.
[38:02.520 --> 38:04.120]  I'm telling you, you're gonna need months.
[38:04.600 --> 38:07.060]  And you need to have surgery or something.
[38:07.460 --> 38:10.780]  No, no, no, no, no, no. It's gonna be fine.
[38:11.460 --> 38:14.920]  But what I was talking about, we kind of went off course because Geoff came back, laughed.
[38:14.920 --> 38:16.760]  Geoff, my waffle days are done.
[38:17.100 --> 38:17.520]  Why?
[38:17.780 --> 38:21.260]  My morning waffle, my desk dogs. It has come to a sad end.
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.040]  I didn't see this coming. I mean, I guess I should have considered it.
[38:26.600 --> 38:33.900]  The electrical cost of making waffles and dogs every day is a lot.
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.260]  Yeah, I got the first electric bill since this operation.
[38:40.860 --> 38:43.380]  It put me in a different tier. I'm not that much over.
[38:43.380 --> 38:46.780]  Yeah, I think I'm borderline because I have a million things plugged in,
[38:46.860 --> 38:50.280]  but it was more expensive than before.
[38:50.560 --> 38:53.180]  I have to retire. I need to use less power.
[38:53.320 --> 38:56.120]  It's surely you're heating because it's winter. It's getting colder.
[38:56.360 --> 38:59.640]  No, no, no, no. I'm not a heating guy. I'm not a heating guy. I don't use heat.
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.060]  Oh, right. You like to have your feet get cold with the open window.
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.580]  Yeah, I'm a cold guy. I don't need the heat. It's not a heating thing.
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.020]  It's the only thing I can think of. I've been cooking waffles and hot dogs like it's a fucking...
[39:11.020 --> 39:14.000]  That can't be it. That's such a short amount of time every day.
[39:14.080 --> 39:17.420]  They're constantly plugged in, though. Waffle maker, not the dog.
[39:17.560 --> 39:18.600]  I agree with Gavin.
[39:18.900 --> 39:19.380]  I don't know.
[39:19.620 --> 39:21.440]  I wouldn't throw in the towel yet if I were you.
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.820]  A, I think Gavin's right. I think that you're overstating the electrical draw.
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.320]  But if you're truly committed to the convenience of waffles and hot dogs
[39:31.540 --> 39:35.780]  on your toilet and in your bed, why don't you just start unplugging shit you're not using?
[39:36.100 --> 39:37.740]  Yeah, make the saving somewhere else.
[39:37.740 --> 39:42.660]  Yeah, like just kill that phantom power and prioritize your power where it matters.
[39:43.080 --> 39:44.820]  I don't know what to cut. That's the problem.
[39:44.980 --> 39:47.340]  Unplug your Xbox when it's not in use.
[39:48.700 --> 39:51.000]  Definitely unplug the waffle maker when you're not using it.
[39:51.140 --> 39:54.180]  Do I have to? Well, if I turn off the Xbox, it surely works, right?
[39:55.060 --> 39:59.160]  I mean, more than... Yeah, I think it probably still draws a little power, but not...
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.800]  It's just I got other devices coming in, too. I just I think I need to put it behind.
[40:03.800 --> 40:09.300]  I tell you what, you could probably, instead of having your fridge with a microphone in it,
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.280]  so the fridge door is leaking open the whole time, maybe you could not do that
[40:13.280 --> 40:15.160]  and then get back to waffles. I fixed that.
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.740]  OK, I fixed that. That's not that's not a problem anymore.
[40:17.840 --> 40:20.640]  You busted out the window, the glass window in the fridge.
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.400]  No, no, no, I didn't bust it open. No, I just I attached it to an end table.
[40:25.660 --> 40:28.060]  So are you guys liking Cyberpunk? Are you enjoying playing it?
[40:28.260 --> 40:29.460]  So far, yeah. Yeah.
[40:29.720 --> 40:32.100]  I mean, I'm not really that far into having an opinion, but...
[40:32.100 --> 40:34.640]  It is open world, right? I assume so.
[40:34.720 --> 40:37.260]  I just keep going from mission to mission, so I don't ever explore.
[40:37.700 --> 40:40.320]  But when one gets the impression and I don't have a map,
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.280]  so one gets the impression it's it's a big game, but I can't really tell.
[40:43.620 --> 40:47.920]  I'm 90 minutes in. I feel like I've maybe played 15 minutes of like actual gameplay.
[40:48.040 --> 40:50.360]  I think I'm like 10% on the character thing.
[40:50.560 --> 40:52.920]  OK, so how did you cheat on on us?
[40:53.040 --> 40:56.040]  I'll tell you how I cheated and I want you to know I feel real bad about it.
[40:56.460 --> 41:01.160]  I've been making podcasts for a very long time, probably 12, 15 years now,
[41:01.160 --> 41:02.400]  however long we've been doing them at the company.
[41:03.320 --> 41:06.300]  The Rooster Teeth podcast, I always viewed that as Gus's podcast.
[41:06.480 --> 41:08.120]  Off topic, I always viewed that as Michael's.
[41:09.400 --> 41:11.380]  I love to sit in on other podcasts here and there,
[41:11.460 --> 41:15.400]  but I've never had like a podcast that I would consider to be like partially mine.
[41:15.620 --> 41:15.980]  This one?
[41:16.120 --> 41:17.300]  This one. Yeah. All three of us.
[41:17.560 --> 41:19.760]  So I've never had ownership over a podcast before.
[41:19.980 --> 41:20.480]  Not really.
[41:21.200 --> 41:23.300]  And so not only do I feel like I cheated on you guys,
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.300]  I feel like I cheated on myself and I feel really weird about that.
[41:27.240 --> 41:30.160]  But Gus and I, who's another asshole that we work with,
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.720]  we'd been talking about making some sort of a podcast together
[41:34.720 --> 41:36.980]  that's not his podcast and it's not our podcast.
[41:37.480 --> 41:42.620]  And so I went and he and I went to a coffee shop to be socially responsible
[41:42.620 --> 41:43.940]  and socially distant.
[41:43.940 --> 41:49.640]  And we set up a podcast set up and we recorded in person next to each other.
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.420]  Well, a safe six feet apart, we recorded a podcast together.
[41:54.060 --> 41:57.800]  And it just, having never owned a podcast before,
[41:57.800 --> 42:02.820]  I never felt the pang of two-timing my own podcast.
[42:02.940 --> 42:04.740]  And I felt a little dirty, I have to admit.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.680]  And so I'm sorry that I did a test podcast with someone that wasn't either of you.
[42:11.100 --> 42:13.100]  I don't want you to think I'm stepping out on you.
[42:13.420 --> 42:18.300]  But the thing that excited me is that it was so much fun to record in person
[42:18.300 --> 42:19.600]  and we've never done that.
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.260]  Like every episode of this podcast has been purely online
[42:23.920 --> 42:27.460]  and no two of us even have been in the same room at the same time and recording.
[42:27.460 --> 42:30.820]  I haven't seen Andrew in real life for like four years.
[42:30.920 --> 42:31.820]  It's been a minute, yeah.
[42:31.920 --> 42:34.440]  Not since he wouldn't get up for me to leave the party.
[42:36.240 --> 42:37.380]  Was that the last time?
[42:37.620 --> 42:38.540]  Yeah, probably.
[42:38.820 --> 42:40.180]  Might have been, yeah.
[42:40.520 --> 42:41.780]  I can't think of a time.
[42:41.920 --> 42:42.780]  That's a pretty long time ago.
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.380]  But, you know, in a post-vaccine world, we'll be able to ideally at some point
[42:48.380 --> 42:52.420]  be in the same room and make this podcast together, at least on a rare occasion.
[42:52.640 --> 42:54.120]  And it's going to be really fun.
[42:54.320 --> 42:55.740]  It's totally different doing it in person.
[42:55.740 --> 42:58.220]  Really, in what way would you say the dynamic would change?
[42:58.400 --> 42:59.500]  I could look in your eyes.
[42:59.660 --> 43:00.280]  That is true.
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.760]  You can see reactions, you know, you can see that how dumbfounded Gavin looks.
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.480]  The moment things are good, say we're all vaccinated, we're all good.
[43:08.820 --> 43:13.640]  The second that happens, we should fly Andrew straight in the moment he's able to.
[43:13.900 --> 43:14.420]  I think so.
[43:14.500 --> 43:17.400]  It would, I, because I thought like, well, how would it be different?
[43:17.540 --> 43:20.560]  But the amount of times I'm throwing my hands in the air
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.220]  while one of you two are saying something, it's constant.
[43:23.500 --> 43:23.660]  Yeah.
[43:23.660 --> 43:25.160]  It's like an absurd statement.
[43:25.160 --> 43:25.940]  Yeah.
[43:26.040 --> 43:29.880]  I honestly, I picture you sat in your chair completely motionless
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.160]  because I always think that you're worried that some sort of fire extinguisher will fall over on you.
[43:36.620 --> 43:37.700]  Fire extinguishers away.
[43:37.840 --> 43:41.600]  I don't think I ever talked about the fire extinguisher is so sticky now.
[43:41.660 --> 43:42.900]  I never want to touch it again.
[43:42.980 --> 43:44.460]  I'm so glad we have a new setup.
[43:44.820 --> 43:46.780]  It got drenched in soda.
[43:47.120 --> 43:48.120]  It was a whole thing.
[43:48.420 --> 43:49.580]  It was a disaster.
[43:49.760 --> 43:50.920]  How did it get drenched?
[43:51.080 --> 43:52.160]  I got myself a treat.
[43:52.160 --> 43:55.500]  Have you guys ever had Canada Dry cranberry ginger ale?
[43:55.800 --> 43:56.020]  Yes.
[43:56.180 --> 43:56.560]  No.
[43:56.780 --> 43:57.480]  It's fantastic.
[43:57.760 --> 43:58.000]  It's good.
[43:58.040 --> 43:58.660]  It's one of my favorites.
[43:58.860 --> 44:00.260]  It's a really good ginger ale.
[44:00.420 --> 44:02.100]  Canada Dry, fantastic ginger ale.
[44:02.540 --> 44:03.500]  But I got it as a treat.
[44:03.600 --> 44:04.820]  I got a plastic bottle.
[44:05.120 --> 44:06.260]  I'm like, I'm going to enjoy this.
[44:06.560 --> 44:07.260]  I opened it.
[44:07.320 --> 44:08.040]  I had one sip.
[44:08.140 --> 44:09.040]  I put it on my desk.
[44:09.440 --> 44:15.360]  I dropped something and like all the cables flew off my desk and the Canada Dry went flying
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.340]  like the fucking greatest wide receiver of all time.
[44:18.580 --> 44:21.580]  I caught it one handed midair while it was moving.
[44:21.580 --> 44:23.200]  And I was so proud of myself.
[44:23.200 --> 44:24.920]  I'm like, I saved the fucking soda.
[44:25.020 --> 44:25.700]  This is amazing.
[44:25.860 --> 44:27.540]  I didn't have the lid fully tightened.
[44:27.960 --> 44:32.400]  So then it just fizzed from the impact and the movement and then hitting my hand.
[44:32.460 --> 44:33.480]  It like shook the soda.
[44:33.760 --> 44:34.820]  It fizzed up.
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.600]  And for two seconds, I just stood there as it was like a fountain.
[44:39.920 --> 44:43.360]  Like it was just shooting soda everywhere in a circular pattern.
[44:44.680 --> 44:46.720]  What are those things called on your ceiling?
[44:47.460 --> 44:47.640]  Fan.
[44:48.100 --> 44:48.380]  No.
[44:48.720 --> 44:49.000]  Light.
[44:49.400 --> 44:50.040]  That's water.
[44:50.040 --> 44:51.740]  They shoot water for fires.
[44:51.860 --> 44:53.820]  Gavin, you've made a video on fire extinguishers.
[44:54.240 --> 44:54.600]  Sprinkler.
[44:55.140 --> 44:56.740]  That's the word I was looking for.
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.940]  Are they called sprinklers if they're in the sky?
[44:59.420 --> 44:59.680]  Yeah.
[44:59.860 --> 45:01.060]  What do you mean if they're in the sky?
[45:01.240 --> 45:03.800]  If they're on the roof, I feel like they have a different name.
[45:03.900 --> 45:05.880]  I feel like there's a fancier fire name.
[45:06.040 --> 45:07.120]  Oh, like a sprunkler?
[45:08.060 --> 45:08.780]  No, exactly.
[45:09.000 --> 45:09.640]  A sprunkler.
[45:09.760 --> 45:11.120]  I think it's a sprinkler.
[45:12.460 --> 45:15.380]  Anyway, it like a sprinkler shot in all directions.
[45:15.380 --> 45:18.500]  And I just had to stand there and like look at it as it happened.
[45:18.560 --> 45:19.540]  There's nothing I could do.
[45:19.540 --> 45:21.500]  I think there was probably a few things you could have done.
[45:22.020 --> 45:24.520]  No, in the moment, Geoff, this was like a bam bam.
[45:24.680 --> 45:26.180]  Like it was a second and a half.
[45:26.580 --> 45:27.860]  There's no time to react.
[45:28.180 --> 45:29.180]  You just had to stare.
[45:29.580 --> 45:32.380]  I guess technically I could have twisted the cap, but it was...
[45:32.380 --> 45:33.460]  This is very quick, Geoff.
[45:33.720 --> 45:35.100]  You would not be prepared for this.
[45:35.220 --> 45:37.280]  Which way up were you storing this Canada Dry?
[45:37.640 --> 45:38.080]  It was up.
[45:38.120 --> 45:39.120]  It was a plastic bottle.
[45:39.220 --> 45:39.840]  It was not...
[45:39.840 --> 45:40.780]  That's a Heinz joke.
[45:40.840 --> 45:41.320]  I get it.
[45:41.400 --> 45:42.360]  I went with the label.
[45:42.500 --> 45:43.100]  It went up.
[45:43.300 --> 45:45.640]  It went all over the fire extinguisher and then you didn't wipe it?
[45:45.760 --> 45:46.060]  No.
[45:46.580 --> 45:48.220]  No, it got everywhere.
[45:48.220 --> 45:49.820]  Can I just say as an aside?
[45:50.180 --> 45:51.140]  That was a pretty funny minute.
[45:51.280 --> 45:51.700]  Good job.
[45:51.900 --> 45:52.260]  Thanks.
[45:52.340 --> 45:52.900]  That was good, actually.
[45:52.960 --> 45:54.000]  Yeah, it was a good minute.
[45:54.320 --> 45:55.280]  It went everywhere, Gavin.
[45:55.340 --> 45:56.760]  So I'm not going to clean the fire extinguisher.
[45:56.840 --> 45:57.460]  It hit the fridge.
[45:57.580 --> 45:59.100]  It coated the side of my body.
[45:59.400 --> 46:00.560]  It went all over the floor.
[46:00.740 --> 46:03.020]  The entire thing fizzed out of the bottle.
[46:03.120 --> 46:04.360]  I got one sip out of it.
[46:04.420 --> 46:04.820]  That's it.
[46:05.060 --> 46:09.200]  And now my fire extinguisher is kind of purply pinkish and it's very sticky.
[46:09.260 --> 46:10.300]  I never want to touch it.
[46:10.300 --> 46:11.300]  It sounds like...
[46:11.300 --> 46:12.800]  Because I feel like you would have mentioned it otherwise.
[46:12.980 --> 46:15.560]  It sounds like all of that happened without you rolling your ankle.
[46:15.860 --> 46:16.760]  No, I was in a chair.
[46:16.840 --> 46:17.180]  I'm safe.
[46:17.180 --> 46:22.000]  My ankle is only at risk when laying in bed or making any other form of movement.
[46:22.540 --> 46:24.060]  In a chair, I'm secure.
[46:26.020 --> 46:27.480]  What were we talking about, though?
[46:27.680 --> 46:28.340]  How did we get here?
[46:28.540 --> 46:32.540]  Well, we were a little bit talking about you coming here, but I was worried that you'll get hurt.
[46:32.780 --> 46:32.940]  Yeah.
[46:33.240 --> 46:33.960]  Oh, I definitely will.
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.180]  I have gotten sick or hurt every trip at once to Austin.
[46:38.640 --> 46:39.260]  Every trip.
[46:39.680 --> 46:42.800]  Terrible colds, fevers, you name it, I've got it.
[46:43.160 --> 46:45.800]  If I don't hurt my ankle, I'm definitely going to get sick.
[46:45.800 --> 46:47.440]  I'll probably get you too sick.
[46:47.660 --> 46:49.160]  Not in a serious way.
[46:49.280 --> 46:49.920]  At worst, fever.
[46:50.140 --> 46:54.620]  You also have tremendous difficulty just getting here and back in general, don't you?
[46:54.680 --> 46:59.020]  Like, didn't you once have a travel journey that door to door was like over a day?
[46:59.220 --> 47:02.960]  Yeah, don't you have to take like a bus to a train to a cart?
[47:03.140 --> 47:03.800]  Yeah, it's everything.
[47:04.020 --> 47:05.420]  Swim a channel to... yeah.
[47:05.600 --> 47:08.300]  It's like winning Running Man just to get to the airport for me.
[47:08.360 --> 47:09.260]  I have to get on a boat.
[47:09.540 --> 47:10.880]  I have to travel.
[47:11.120 --> 47:13.120]  It's a whole fucking experience.
[47:13.900 --> 47:14.740]  It's not great.
[47:15.200 --> 47:16.140]  It's a full day.
[47:16.260 --> 47:19.220]  I spend a night at the airport whenever I traveled to Austin.
[47:19.380 --> 47:20.860]  But I think you're just doing it wrong.
[47:20.960 --> 47:23.440]  You must be able to fly from your nearest airport.
[47:23.720 --> 47:25.660]  Yeah, I don't... but that seems like work.
[47:25.740 --> 47:26.400]  I take the boat.
[47:26.480 --> 47:27.280]  The boat is fun.
[47:27.560 --> 47:28.480]  I cross the water.
[47:28.680 --> 47:29.720]  I get on a bus.
[47:30.160 --> 47:31.380]  I then get on a train.
[47:31.800 --> 47:32.760]  And then I'm at the airport.
[47:33.140 --> 47:36.200]  But with the flights, there's not a lot of Austin flights.
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.240]  So like, unless I want to show up at Austin at like fucking 10 p.m. or midnight.
[47:40.460 --> 47:41.080]  That's fine.
[47:41.300 --> 47:43.860]  No, because you waste a whole day that way.
[47:43.860 --> 47:45.540]  I'd rather come earlier in the day.
[47:45.620 --> 47:49.140]  So then I spend a night in the airport, catch a really early flight.
[47:49.200 --> 47:51.520]  And then I get to Austin like midday.
[47:51.560 --> 47:55.120]  Guys, should I tell like the worst Austin travel experience I ever had?
[47:55.200 --> 47:56.040]  Like the craziest one?
[47:56.100 --> 47:57.160]  You both know this.
[47:57.320 --> 47:57.860]  Yeah, please.
[47:58.040 --> 47:59.720]  I'm traveling and you always have to connect.
[47:59.860 --> 48:00.980]  So I'm going from Vancouver.
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.000]  Typically, I connect in Arizona, sometimes Denver, mainly Arizona.
[48:05.180 --> 48:06.140]  So we connect.
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.700]  And when you're on a plane, there is no... maybe not even plane specific.
[48:11.360 --> 48:15.940]  Generally speaking, there is no greater joy than not having the seat next to you taken
[48:15.940 --> 48:16.980]  and you're going on a flight.
[48:17.080 --> 48:17.760]  It's fantastic.
[48:18.260 --> 48:20.540]  It's such a great feeling just to have that extra space.
[48:20.700 --> 48:22.460]  The seats are so uncomfortable.
[48:22.700 --> 48:23.720]  Flying is so uncomfortable.
[48:24.180 --> 48:25.260]  Having that space is great.
[48:25.500 --> 48:29.500]  So I'm on the plane to Arizona and nobody's sitting next to me.
[48:29.620 --> 48:30.800]  And I'm so excited.
[48:30.800 --> 48:34.280]  And I'm doing the thing where I'm looking at every single person boarding the flight.
[48:34.460 --> 48:37.100]  And just as they walk by me, I get more and more excited.
[48:37.100 --> 48:38.740]  And I see this one guy.
[48:38.940 --> 48:39.920]  I'm a big guy.
[48:39.920 --> 48:40.940]  And this guy was a big guy.
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.100]  He was very John Goodman-esque in appearance.
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.040]  He's wearing this white shirt that's just covered in dirt.
[48:47.480 --> 48:49.000]  Just dirt all over it.
[48:49.180 --> 48:54.140]  Like he had just killed somebody, buried the body, and is now fleeing to go to a different state.
[48:54.320 --> 48:55.660]  That's the kind of dirt it was.
[48:55.940 --> 48:57.020]  Yeah, that's what it looked.
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.840]  It looked like a Breaking Bad scenario dirt.
[49:00.080 --> 49:03.100]  It just seemed like there was a crime attached to that dirt.
[49:03.100 --> 49:04.940]  And plus the size.
[49:05.360 --> 49:07.940]  I just thought, please don't sit next to me.
[49:08.140 --> 49:09.340]  Anyone else but you.
[49:09.480 --> 49:10.860]  And he sits next to me.
[49:11.040 --> 49:11.920]  He's a really nice guy.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.120]  He says he's a roofer.
[49:13.200 --> 49:16.040]  I mean, you don't know anything to be true when you're talking to someone on a plane.
[49:16.100 --> 49:16.860]  There's no proof.
[49:17.160 --> 49:19.140]  But he claimed that he worked in the roofing industry.
[49:19.640 --> 49:21.020]  Seemed like a really sweet guy.
[49:21.420 --> 49:21.900]  We're flying.
[49:22.020 --> 49:23.980]  We're doing basic plane small talk.
[49:24.500 --> 49:27.700]  And in the middle of the flight, he's like, oh, I wonder what that movie is.
[49:27.940 --> 49:30.980]  And I used to do this movie league where I'd get my friends together.
[49:30.980 --> 49:32.600]  We'd have a fake auction over the summer.
[49:32.700 --> 49:34.980]  And whoever had the most money would win for the movies they pick.
[49:35.360 --> 49:37.580]  So I could call out essentially any movie at that time.
[49:37.600 --> 49:38.660]  And I'm like, oh, it's that movie.
[49:39.100 --> 49:40.440]  And he was blown away by this.
[49:40.620 --> 49:43.200]  And I said, well, yeah, I used to do this movie league thing.
[49:43.220 --> 49:44.600]  And he's like, well, was there money involved?
[49:44.660 --> 49:45.280]  And I said no.
[49:45.320 --> 49:47.100]  And he's like, oh, so then you're just a massive dork.
[49:47.220 --> 49:50.400]  It's like, OK, he's like, oh, I guess I don't need to kill you for your money.
[49:50.640 --> 49:51.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.040]  Anyway, we continue our small talk.
[49:54.060 --> 49:55.220]  We're about to get to Austin.
[49:55.340 --> 49:56.140]  I'm so excited.
[49:56.480 --> 49:58.300]  I have people that are going to pick me up from the airport.
[49:58.300 --> 50:00.180]  And then we divert.
[50:00.540 --> 50:02.280]  The plane immediately adjusts.
[50:02.600 --> 50:06.040]  And the pilot comes on and says, there is a lightning storm
[50:06.040 --> 50:09.220]  that is currently only happening above the airport.
[50:09.700 --> 50:10.980]  It just hit the airport.
[50:11.360 --> 50:12.420]  We're going to Houston.
[50:12.640 --> 50:14.380]  We have to land the plane in Houston now.
[50:14.440 --> 50:15.440]  We'll figure out flights later.
[50:15.980 --> 50:17.340]  I've never experienced this.
[50:17.420 --> 50:19.420]  I don't know how this process works at all.
[50:19.480 --> 50:20.600]  I was on a really tight budget.
[50:20.980 --> 50:24.280]  I didn't understand how they'd create a new flight from Houston to Austin
[50:24.280 --> 50:26.200]  for everybody technically that was on the plane.
[50:26.200 --> 50:28.260]  I just didn't know how that would work.
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.360]  So the guy sitting next to me, I'll call him Evan.
[50:31.800 --> 50:34.880]  Evan says, I might just get a car and drive.
[50:35.840 --> 50:37.080]  It was San Antonio.
[50:37.300 --> 50:38.840]  We were getting diverted to San Antonio.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.280]  He said, I might just get a car and drive to San Antonio.
[50:41.640 --> 50:42.900]  If you want to come, you can.
[50:43.260 --> 50:44.760]  I thought that was a ridiculous request.
[50:44.840 --> 50:46.260]  But then I'm thinking more and more about it.
[50:46.580 --> 50:50.200]  We land and we get out and I decide I'm just going to start following Evan
[50:50.200 --> 50:51.060]  because I'm on a budget.
[50:51.180 --> 50:52.520]  I don't know how the plane thing works.
[50:52.700 --> 50:54.200]  And then he goes to the bathroom.
[50:54.200 --> 50:57.820]  And it's one of those moments where you can decide I can either walk away
[50:57.820 --> 50:59.540]  and just try to figure this out.
[50:59.860 --> 51:03.360]  Or if I stay here, I'm now committed to Evan for wherever this goes.
[51:03.740 --> 51:06.260]  And I thought about it and I decided to stay.
[51:06.740 --> 51:10.680]  Evan booked the car and we walked and he got like the last vehicle.
[51:11.040 --> 51:13.460]  Except they kind of said a different name than what he said on the plane.
[51:13.560 --> 51:16.820]  So then I started getting paranoid that I actually don't know anything about this person.
[51:17.120 --> 51:18.720]  I've never met them before on this plane.
[51:19.040 --> 51:20.080]  Now we're best buds.
[51:20.340 --> 51:22.060]  And he's got that crime dirt all over him.
[51:22.060 --> 51:23.300]  He's got the crime dirt.
[51:23.440 --> 51:26.860]  And he looks like John Goodman, who is one of his personalities.
[51:26.980 --> 51:30.800]  John Goodman ish too, which is the scariest personality to deal with
[51:30.800 --> 51:34.760]  because he can be a psychotic killer while also being extremely warm.
[51:35.100 --> 51:36.980]  I've seen that range from John Goodman.
[51:37.060 --> 51:39.720]  So applying it to this person was terrifying.
[51:39.800 --> 51:43.540]  On top of the fact I've never been to San Antonio and I don't have a cell phone.
[51:43.900 --> 51:48.040]  I have a cell phone, but I don't know how like I'm scared that I'm going to get overage charges
[51:48.040 --> 51:49.620]  because it's a whole like roaming.
[51:49.620 --> 51:52.740]  You're in Houston trying to get to Austin, but you're going to San Antonio.
[51:52.960 --> 51:55.340]  No, no, no. Sorry. I misspoke earlier with Houston.
[51:55.440 --> 51:58.020]  We got diverted to San Antonio to go to Austin.
[51:58.140 --> 52:02.840]  So I'm in San Antonio with Evan, this guy I met on the flight.
[52:03.180 --> 52:04.640]  And we just had basic small talk.
[52:04.900 --> 52:06.540]  And now we're going on a road trip together.
[52:06.920 --> 52:09.560]  And so I follow him. We get a car. He lets me go.
[52:09.620 --> 52:10.720]  I don't have to pay for anything.
[52:10.940 --> 52:15.740]  But now I'm in a car with this 60-year-old guy who works in the roofing industry named Evan.
[52:15.940 --> 52:17.700]  I've got nothing in common with him.
[52:17.700 --> 52:21.360]  And we're going from San Antonio to Austin, a trip I've never done before.
[52:21.800 --> 52:23.660]  So I'm kind of scared I'm going to get killed.
[52:23.860 --> 52:24.880]  And I have no phone.
[52:24.980 --> 52:27.100]  So like if something happens, I've got no way to call it.
[52:27.160 --> 52:29.900]  I have no way to know if we're going is the right way.
[52:30.400 --> 52:32.060]  So it becomes this whole process.
[52:32.500 --> 52:38.780]  And it's the weirdest thing of like we elevate from small talk on the plane to now we're having real
[52:38.780 --> 52:43.960]  talk about like his family dynamics and how things are tough at home and like what his son is doing.
[52:43.960 --> 52:47.040]  And that they just had a loss in their family.
[52:47.260 --> 52:49.660]  And that his kid is an alcoholic.
[52:49.900 --> 52:51.200]  And they're going through that process.
[52:51.460 --> 52:52.520]  And it gets really heavy.
[52:52.620 --> 52:56.520]  I have a really heavy emotional talk with Evan on the way there.
[52:56.660 --> 52:57.640]  How old are you at this point?
[52:57.880 --> 52:59.360]  I am... how old am I?
[52:59.540 --> 53:00.340]  I'm maybe 20.
[53:00.680 --> 53:01.880]  I'm like 20 or 21.
[53:02.080 --> 53:06.740]  So I'm wondering, do you have the wisdom that he's after here with this conversation?
[53:08.880 --> 53:13.720]  I think based on everything on this podcast, the answer would be absolutely not.
[53:13.720 --> 53:15.220]  But I'm really good at listening.
[53:15.740 --> 53:16.920]  I'm good at listening.
[53:17.020 --> 53:17.740]  I was listening.
[53:17.880 --> 53:20.320]  I was just hearing it like I was just being very generally supportive.
[53:20.600 --> 53:24.100]  But this is a guy I met on an airplane an hour and a half ago.
[53:24.180 --> 53:27.800]  And now we're in a car together from San Antonio to Austin, maybe.
[53:27.840 --> 53:28.500]  Like, hopefully.
[53:28.580 --> 53:30.040]  I don't know actually where we're going.
[53:30.480 --> 53:32.220]  And that's what, like an hour and a half journey?
[53:32.480 --> 53:33.540]  Yeah, it's a 90 minute.
[53:33.800 --> 53:36.320]  Well, yeah, I heard it was 90 minutes, but I have no idea.
[53:36.380 --> 53:37.760]  I've never gone this route before.
[53:38.100 --> 53:40.640]  So me and Evan are just talking back and forth.
[53:40.680 --> 53:42.960]  And then I talk about like stuff that's happening in my life.
[53:42.960 --> 53:46.860]  I think there's kind of a weird freedom and an understanding of we're never going to interact
[53:46.860 --> 53:47.700]  with each other again.
[53:48.080 --> 53:50.920]  So there is an ability to say kind of whatever you want to.
[53:51.120 --> 53:52.540]  And there's no repercussion.
[53:52.700 --> 53:57.780]  It felt like a very strange, like indie coming of age movie with this 20 year old and this
[53:57.780 --> 54:00.880]  60 year old with nothing in common making this road trip.
[54:00.940 --> 54:06.600]  I then get scared, though, because his phone rings and he takes the phone off the thing
[54:06.600 --> 54:08.360]  like he's using it for a MapQuest.
[54:08.520 --> 54:10.540]  And then he just stops using it, which made me uncomfortable.
[54:11.040 --> 54:12.400]  And he's talking for a little bit.
[54:12.400 --> 54:15.320]  And then he's like, hey, I'm going to put us on speaker.
[54:15.500 --> 54:16.480]  It was his wife.
[54:16.560 --> 54:20.900]  And his wife had the most thick, like comedically thick Southern accent.
[54:21.140 --> 54:22.960]  And he explained the scenario to her.
[54:23.040 --> 54:24.900]  And she's just like, you're the nicest guy ever.
[54:25.280 --> 54:26.260]  I know that wasn't Southern accent.
[54:26.320 --> 54:26.940]  I'm not going to try.
[54:27.040 --> 54:28.200]  It'd be atrocious if I did try.
[54:28.480 --> 54:29.680]  It's just very loud.
[54:30.020 --> 54:31.740]  I really wish you would try.
[54:32.100 --> 54:33.500]  It's no, it's going to be bad.
[54:33.600 --> 54:35.400]  This is once again, like the minute thing.
[54:35.500 --> 54:36.580]  There's too much pressure.
[54:36.800 --> 54:37.680]  I can't do it.
[54:37.860 --> 54:39.320]  But it was comedically thick.
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.020]  If almost someone was doing a shitty impersonation, I should have just done it.
[54:43.260 --> 54:44.340]  That's how thick it was.
[54:44.780 --> 54:50.400]  And it just turned into now the scenario of I'm talking to Evan and his wife just about life.
[54:50.640 --> 54:53.020]  And I'm just trying to go to a convention in Texas.
[54:53.540 --> 54:56.260]  This is a complete detour.
[54:56.700 --> 54:58.020]  And it's a 90 minute trip.
[54:58.360 --> 54:58.960]  And it was wonderful.
[54:59.160 --> 55:03.320]  Definitely a moment where you're like, how did I end up at this point in my life?
[55:03.460 --> 55:06.040]  Yeah, like the first episode of F*** Face,
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.260]  we talked, well, I guess I went with like I had to go with them.
[55:09.400 --> 55:10.960]  That wasn't a thing I needed to do.
[55:11.080 --> 55:13.200]  But none of this was like forced by me.
[55:13.220 --> 55:14.740]  It just kind of all happened.
[55:14.860 --> 55:17.060]  I just followed the path until the destination.
[55:17.380 --> 55:17.920]  I'll be honest.
[55:18.220 --> 55:21.060]  In a million years, I never would have made that decision.
[55:21.400 --> 55:22.500]  I never would have gone with the guy.
[55:23.780 --> 55:27.600]  I've done the exact same thing, but on a much longer drive when I was in the army.
[55:27.880 --> 55:28.120]  Really?
[55:28.300 --> 55:28.760]  It was brutal.
[55:29.060 --> 55:30.900]  Yeah, I've been in your position, Andrew.
[55:31.180 --> 55:32.120]  I'll tell the story sometime.
[55:32.200 --> 55:33.180]  I don't feel like telling it right now.
[55:33.180 --> 55:41.640]  But I went from El Paso to Fort Hood with a newly married couple who was fighting
[55:41.640 --> 55:46.240]  with a newborn baby who had been on a plane for like 24 hours straight.
[55:46.500 --> 55:51.360]  And the baby screamed for the, I don't know, nine hours we were in the car, maybe.
[55:52.280 --> 55:53.180]  The entire time.
[55:53.380 --> 55:53.560]  Yeah.
[55:53.780 --> 55:59.140]  And they asked me to hold it for a while because they were fed up with it.
[55:59.140 --> 56:00.060]  They didn't know what else to try.
[56:00.340 --> 56:02.400]  So I had to hold some strange baby for a while.
[56:02.400 --> 56:02.960]  It was...
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.020]  You sound sad just talking.
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.500]  I can't tell if this is the feet of your cable.
[56:08.660 --> 56:10.340]  That put you in a dark place.
[56:10.620 --> 56:12.120]  Yeah, you were really down to that.
[56:12.220 --> 56:13.920]  I'm all discombobulated from earlier.
[56:14.100 --> 56:17.180]  All the fucking tragedy of the first 30 minutes of this podcast.
[56:17.940 --> 56:18.400]  And then...
[56:18.400 --> 56:19.640]  It was a great 30 minutes.
[56:19.700 --> 56:23.700]  Then I've been working up the courage to talk about this thing that is creeping me out.
[56:24.020 --> 56:30.840]  And then Andrew forced me to remember of a memory of the time that I went AWOL
[56:30.840 --> 56:32.660]  from the army for like four days.
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.360]  And it was a whole thing.
[56:34.720 --> 56:37.560]  And I just hadn't thought about that since like in probably 15 years.
[56:37.720 --> 56:41.380]  So I'll need to collect my thoughts on that story and I'll tell it next time.
[56:41.640 --> 56:42.420]  What was creeping you out?
[56:42.520 --> 56:43.520]  Is that a story for next time?
[56:43.680 --> 56:43.900]  Yeah.
[56:44.020 --> 56:45.260]  What was creeping me out?
[56:45.400 --> 56:45.760]  Didn't you...
[56:45.760 --> 56:46.680]  Oh, is that the same thing?
[56:46.980 --> 56:48.360]  No, the thing that I don't...
[56:48.360 --> 56:52.540]  I want to talk about, but I've been struggling with this thing for a while.
[56:52.900 --> 56:56.440]  I don't know if we want to get into it now or if we want to wait for more technical problems or...
[56:58.440 --> 57:00.320]  I think that's for you to decide, Geoff.
[57:00.320 --> 57:02.060]  I don't know how to...
[57:02.060 --> 57:02.280]  All right.
[57:02.580 --> 57:04.820]  This is something that's been bothering me for years.
[57:05.060 --> 57:05.460]  Okay?
[57:05.780 --> 57:06.000]  Okay.
[57:06.140 --> 57:06.680]  I say that.
[57:06.860 --> 57:14.700]  And I swear to you that this is with 100% honesty and transparency that I'm telling you these things.
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.820]  And I'm being very vulnerable to you, two of my closest friends right now.
[57:21.180 --> 57:24.540]  And I'd like you to take that into consideration as you mock me.
[57:24.540 --> 57:24.880]  Do you...
[57:24.880 --> 57:25.380]  Before we laugh.
[57:25.400 --> 57:25.980]  No, do you...
[57:25.980 --> 57:26.720]  No, time out.
[57:26.720 --> 57:32.220]  I fucking said last episode that I didn't know what years my teenage years were.
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.100]  What podcast do you think you're on that you need to do this whole, like...
[57:36.100 --> 57:38.500]  We need to be careful if I say something stupid.
[57:38.700 --> 57:39.960]  Well, no, I just...
[57:39.960 --> 57:40.500]  How about this?
[57:40.900 --> 57:46.320]  Would you think it would be weird if you were to wake up every day of your life for...
[57:47.100 --> 57:47.540]  I don't know.
[57:47.560 --> 57:49.080]  Let's say three years, maybe longer.
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.840]  And next to your desk, there was a coin.
[57:52.160 --> 57:52.940]  Like, let's say a quarter.
[57:53.060 --> 57:54.120]  Just a bog-standard quarter.
[57:54.120 --> 57:57.580]  Or a loonie, or whatever the fuck they call it in Canada.
[57:58.060 --> 58:01.240]  And the first thing you did when you got up every day was you picked up that coin,
[58:01.320 --> 58:01.960]  and you flipped it.
[58:02.320 --> 58:03.320]  And you called heads or tails.
[58:03.500 --> 58:07.160]  And every day for, let's just say, three years, it was tails.
[58:07.920 --> 58:09.160]  100% of the time.
[58:09.380 --> 58:09.980]  Never heads.
[58:10.140 --> 58:10.360]  Ever.
[58:10.640 --> 58:12.940]  And you started to get freaked out by it.
[58:13.180 --> 58:17.060]  So you would put a different quarter down, and you threw the other quarter away.
[58:17.560 --> 58:19.680]  And it was still tails every day.
[58:19.980 --> 58:22.740]  So you got a nickel, and you tried that, and it's still tails.
[58:22.740 --> 58:25.140]  So you take it outside, and you throw it up in the air, and you let it hit the ground.
[58:25.700 --> 58:26.280]  Still tails.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.280]  Everything that you can do, the coin still flips tails every day of your life.
[58:31.880 --> 58:33.720]  That's been happening to me with socks.
[58:35.080 --> 58:35.480]  What?
[58:37.320 --> 58:37.720]  What?
[58:38.480 --> 58:42.980]  I was about to make a Harvey Dent joke, and then you switched it to socks.
[58:43.340 --> 58:44.220]  What do you mean?
[58:44.380 --> 58:45.760]  I don't know how that even applies.
[58:46.100 --> 58:49.160]  I was so excited about this coin story.
[58:50.180 --> 58:51.280]  I was riveted.
[58:51.500 --> 58:52.660]  I'm just trying to make it make sense.
[58:52.660 --> 58:54.300]  No, time out for a second.
[58:54.660 --> 58:57.980]  Have you not been flipping a coin every day of your life?
[58:58.320 --> 58:59.260]  Metaphorically, I have.
[58:59.480 --> 59:00.680]  What the fuck?
[59:00.960 --> 59:01.840]  What do you mean?
[59:02.520 --> 59:06.000]  I was imagining you in your backyard throwing a coin.
[59:06.260 --> 59:08.020]  That's the picture I want you to have.
[59:08.320 --> 59:13.540]  I want you to understand, Andrew, my frustration, and my concern, and my fear.
[59:13.940 --> 59:18.780]  I'm trying to make it relatable to you, because it's such a weird thing I'm about to explain to you.
[59:18.820 --> 59:20.000]  What the fuck?
[59:20.380 --> 59:22.220]  Okay, so let's... here.
[59:22.660 --> 59:25.740]  And before you say it, you're gonna come up with lots of ways that I can test this,
[59:25.800 --> 59:27.560]  and I'm gonna tell you I have an answer for every one of them.
[59:27.900 --> 59:28.260]  Okay.
[59:28.580 --> 59:28.820]  Alright.
[59:29.480 --> 59:30.660]  Every day of my fucking life.
[59:30.740 --> 59:31.720]  What was that?
[59:31.780 --> 59:32.960]  Every day I get up.
[59:32.980 --> 59:34.860]  Been doing the same with socks.
[59:37.460 --> 59:37.820]  Every...
[59:38.400 --> 59:39.940]  My girlfriend doesn't even know about this.
[59:40.040 --> 59:41.600]  I've never even mentioned it to her, and I live with it.
[59:41.780 --> 59:43.040]  I suffer in silence.
[59:43.160 --> 59:45.100]  I can't imagine how that applies.
[59:45.280 --> 59:47.720]  You're the only people I've ever spoken to about this.
[59:48.440 --> 59:49.740]  Every year, guys.
[59:50.300 --> 59:52.960]  900,000 days in a row, maybe, of my life.
[59:53.260 --> 59:59.500]  I am at a point in my life where every pair of socks I own has an L or an R on the toe.
[59:59.860 --> 01:00:00.140]  Right?
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.040]  You know how you get a pair of nice socks.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.760]  Gavin, you remember the whole sock revolution we had at Achievement 100 years ago,
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.020]  and I bought you guys all nice socks.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.300]  Well, if you look at your nice socks, if you have any pairs of nice socks...
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.660]  Socks now, they have a left sock and a right sock.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.680]  And they'll tell you, right?
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.580]  By the big toe, there's an L.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.800]  And right by the other big toe, there's an R.
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.240]  Meaning that the L sock is obviously for your left foot.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.620]  It's probably designed that way to be ergonomic and hug and comfort your foot.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.540]  And then the other sock, same thing, obviously.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:31.720]  Just makes sense.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:38.480]  However, what happens to me is every day when I get up and I go through the same routine,
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.120]  and then I sit down and I pick up...
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.080]  I'm left-handed, right?
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.500]  I sit down on my sofa or wherever, and I go to pick up a sock.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.840]  And I instinctively pick up to put a sock on my right foot.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.200]  I fucking hate this.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.580]  I pick up every single time the left sock.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.060]  Why did you do the coin story?
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.080]  Because it's the same thing.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.120]  I've got a 50-50 shot of getting the left or the right sock.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.180]  I know, but that still applies to the sock.
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.140]  Why is it only the left sock every time?
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.680]  I fold them differently. I mess them up.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.960]  I can't not pick the left sock.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.920]  But why tell the coin thing?
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.440]  It's the same story.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.080]  You just changed the item.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.040]  You told the same story twice.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.600]  Like we couldn't comprehend the sock thing without the coin thing.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.700]  I wasn't sure you could.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.160]  I was trying to come up with an analogy.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.580]  You're explaining a 50% probability.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.980]  You're getting bogged down in the coin thing.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.160]  Well, because you brought it up.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.800]  Help me fix my problem.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.500]  It was a great story.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.100]  My point is, I think I'm living in a simulation.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:45.460]  And every day at this moment, something syncs or reboots.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.680]  And I'm getting stuck with the goddamn left sock on my right foot.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.580]  And I've done everything I can think of to do it.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.940]  I've laid the socks out the night before.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.900]  And somehow I still end up with the left sock.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.180]  And I always forget, right?
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.960]  I even think, like one time, I've even left myself notes on my nightstand.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.720]  Don't forget the sock thing.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.280]  And what invariably happens is, I'll get up and I'll go through the motions.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.060]  And the next thing I know, I'm just sitting down with my left sock on my right foot.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.080]  Every time.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.220]  I can't see it coming.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440]  I can't predict it.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.040]  I'm powerless to stop it.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.800]  I've even gone through periods where I'm like, fuck it.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.240]  I'm just gonna tell the universe, I like it that way.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.280]  I'm gonna put my left sock on my right foot.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.040]  And I've done it.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.980]  I've done it for months.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.120]  Just to spite the universe?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:27.660]  Just to spite.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.820]  And the universe doesn't care.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.480]  There's no trick in it.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.620]  It's still... and I hate it.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.760]  And I'm lying to myself.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.860]  I have a brief side question.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.020]  What age did you start sitting down to put your socks on?
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.300]  Oh, I'm lazy, dude.
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.440]  Probably like 15.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.100]  To me, that's like an old dude thing.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:46.600]  That's fine.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.780]  What do you stand up and put your socks on?
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.960]  Yeah, but I don't have fancy L and R's.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.300]  I just...
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.960]  You probably have more L's and R's on your socks than you would realize.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:54.580]  Oh, maybe.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.740]  I just stand with one sock in both hands.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.120]  I just shove my foot down it.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.080]  And I do the same again.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.720]  Once you become aware that there are sides to your socks, it's gonna fuck with you.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.020]  I even like...
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.160]  This morning, I was in the shower.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.020]  And I was taking a shower.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.140]  And I looked down.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.520]  And I was like, I saw my feet.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.280]  And I went, oh, fuck.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.140]  I haven't done my socks yet.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.160]  I'm gonna fucking think about it.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.680]  And I'm like, no, but I always forget.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.600]  Like the universe always fucks with me and it makes me forget.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.080]  So I thought, like, I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna visualize everything I'm about to do
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.620]  until I get to the socks, right?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.920]  And then I'm gonna force myself to pick the right sock.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.980]  And so I'm in the shower.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.140]  I'm like, I'm gonna finish showering.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.520]  And then I'm gonna towel off.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.560]  And there's my towel right there.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.780]  And then I'm gonna get the blow dryer.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.900]  I'm gonna blow dry my hair and my balls and my butt.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.740]  I'm gonna blow dry my shins and my underarms.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.960]  And then fucking, there's arrows barking.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.980]  I need to, I gotta let her out of the crate or she's gonna piss the fucking crate.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:45.800]  Which reminds me, I need to clean the, her pad again because her butthole's been smelling bad lately.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:46.940]  And oh my god!
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.060]  I'm already, I've already got the left sock in my hand and my right foot out.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.040]  How did this happen?
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.880]  It just fucking, it just comes out of nowhere every day.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.900]  And I don't know what to do about it.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.600]  And I can't pick up the right sock.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.740]  Why don't you try picking the socks up from the other side?
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:01.600]  I've done that!
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.100]  I've even folded them different.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.100]  The point is, there's a blank space in my mind where somewhere between before I get to the socks
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.260]  and to the moment of realization where I am powerless.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:17.080]  I'm like on autopilot and I can't affect that moment in time until it's too late.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.320]  It's like the beginning of prey.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.780]  I think you're just living the same day over and over again and they're just resetting things.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.860]  It feels like it.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.140]  It fucking feels like it.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.600]  And it manifests itself in my feet every single day of my life.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.460]  And I wish to God I didn't even have socks with L's and R's, but I do.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.360]  Here's what we'll do.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.800]  I'm gonna buy you some gloves.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.460]  We'll see what happens with those.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.460]  All right.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.880]  Then I gotta put on gloves every day?
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.760]  Where are the L's and the R's on the socks?
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.080]  I went to get my socks while you were talking.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.940]  I'm looking, I have two socks right now.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.080]  I have no fancy socks.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.800]  Do they have to, like, why are you...
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.020]  Here, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.140]  I'm gonna send you a picture of it.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:54.580]  See, what I did, the greatest sock thing I've ever done, I gave away all my socks,
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.000]  and then I just bought all the same pair.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.860]  One of the best moves I've ever made.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.240]  What, they all like white socks?
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.640]  No, they're all like black socks.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.380]  It's like, I never, like, I always, they always match.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.720]  I'm never missing a sock.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.700]  I put no thought into it.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.460]  I just grab my socks.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.000]  I've said some absurd things on this podcast.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.460]  I think Geoff's coin thing is the craziest moment that has ever happened.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.400]  Why do you say that?
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:21.020]  Because it was so unnecessary, and I was so much more invested in your coin.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:27.140]  Do you know how weird it is to try to fucking explain this weird sock thing?
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.580]  I thought it was a little hard to wrap your head around.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.880]  I was trying to cushion the blow.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:31.880]  No, it's not.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.820]  It's 50-50.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.120]  You have a left sock and a right sock, and you keep getting the...
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.080]  Gavin, how do you feel?
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:39.320]  Are you as outraged at Andrew that I told the coin flip thing?
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.620]  Uh, I'm with him in that we absolutely would have understood.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.380]  Oh, is that a picture of your sock?
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.500]  Yeah, see, there's the L.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.500]  You actually have an L.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.020]  Oh, it's there. I was thinking it'd be on the toe.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.900]  It moves around. It varies from sock to sock.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.880]  I was thinking ankle.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.580]  It moves around. It's wherever the company that produced that sock puts it.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.940]  Eric said it's on the wrong foot. That's his left foot, Eric.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.900]  That's my... it's on the right foot now because I fucking fixed it.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.520]  But this morning, I tried to put that sock on my right foot,
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.940]  and there was nothing I could do about it.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.340]  Eric said that looks wrong.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.680]  Eric, what the hell does your foot look like? Do you have a big toe on the outside?
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.040]  No, I...
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.300]  I agree with Eric. The L shouldn't look that way.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:17.680]  Yeah.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.180]  The L should be pointed at you in the photo. In the photo, the L is like a bad T.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.020]  There's something about it that just looking at it looks like you...
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:29.180]  I understand what you're saying. It's L and it's left foot. I get it.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:33.740]  But there's something about the way that it looks that looks like you did it wrong.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.020]  Yeah.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.460]  You said it's on the wrong foot.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.480]  It's not on the wrong foot.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.380]  I'm looking at it in my knee-jerk rea...
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.140]  If I didn't see the L, I would go, that sock's not on the right foot.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.360]  Yeah, but socks are upside down when you wear them.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.460]  Is this the Rooster Teeth podcast? What the fuck did you just say?
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.180]  Like, when you're looking at socks, you hold them, like, opening at the top.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.400]  But when you wear them, you look at your toe and that's...
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.140]  What? Oh, thanks for...
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:57.680]  What are you saying?
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.320]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:58.640]  Thanks for watching...
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:03.600]  I'm gonna send one more photo. Just so you can see.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.840]  Yeah, go ahead. Send another one.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.200]  I still have one brief thing I really need to document.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.000]  We're... this is so... we're so over time.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.680]  Yeah, it's really quick.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.760]  Eric, you know. I gotta mention this. You know.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.540]  You know what this is.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.820]  Yeah, no, no, go for it. Go for it.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.400]  They don't know what it is. We have an amazing community.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:20.860]  Oh, boy.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.260]  That is absurdly creative and thoughtful. And they've been working... the people on the
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.880]  Discord... some of the people on the Discord have been working on a project for weeks,
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:34.600]  top secret. I have a very small role in it. Eric has a really small role in it. It's really...
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:40.140]  It was their creation. It's so impressive. They made a f*** face Christmas album.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.880]  Like a legit Christmas album. They like changed lyrics around. They got their own music. They had
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.360]  their own recordings. I'm loading up my desktop to post the album art because it takes f***
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.000]  forever because I'm on a slow machine and it's not going to be here because nothing
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.500]  ever works the way I want. But they made an entire f*** Christmas album. It's absurd.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.400]  Twelve songs.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.240]  Is this the last episode before Christmas?
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:00.800]  No.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.620]  No, there'd be one. Yeah, it is. This would come out December 23rd, I think.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:04.920]  Okay.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.020]  I don't know if Eric can back me on that. Is that right, Eric?
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:08.480]  Yes.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.400]  Nick says yes.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.380]  So this would be the Christmas episode. Here it is. Here's the album art. And then I'll post
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:19.300]  something. Obviously, I can't really listen to it right now, but just we're sharing. It's amazing
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:24.380]  what they did. They made a f***ing infomercial for it. It's fantastic. It's like a whole f***ing
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.500]  Christmas thing. I just felt like it was worth mentioning.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.960]  The F*** Face Discord Orchestra.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:36.840]  Yes, that looks awesome. And I'm excited to hear it. But what I want to know, there's a better
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.680]  picture of my feet, by the way. You can see the L and the R.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.620]  Some people will be very excited about that.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.020]  See, that's upside down now.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.200]  What I want to know is how do I fix this f***ing, like, am I living in a simulation?
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.920]  Am I, is this the Matrix? Or B, how the f*** do I get past this? Because it's, it's,
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.460]  it's destroying me mentally.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:01.200]  Throw away all the left and right socks and get some universal any foot goes pairs of socks.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.160]  Yeah, they made 12 f***ing socks.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.260]  F***ing 12, 12 socks.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.140]  Your sock thing is fine, Geoff. Like, who cares if you got the left and the right?
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.740]  Yeah, I mean, I think it would be, I just think it would be more interesting if you did flip
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.220]  that coin and it always came up tails.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.720]  It would be way more interesting.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.000]  I'm doing it. It's the same thing. I'm coming up left every time.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.360]  Thank you for using the analogy as it was intended, though, Eric.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.800]  I can tell that my lesson worked with you.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:29.420]  What do you mean?
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.580]  I bet you're subconsciously looking and glancing at the left.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.780]  I'm not. I'm desperate not to do it.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:38.060]  And left always comes before right. So you're just grabbing that one.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.540]  Oftentimes, I can't even see the L or the R. I just pick it up randomly and I go,
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.480]  surely this can't be that. Nope, it's the f***ing left.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.980]  Do you think Emily is sabotaging you somehow?
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.320]  How could she control that?
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:53.600]  I don't think she's that detail oriented.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.080]  I thought maybe she was like, like she had like witch powers or something.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.400]  Oh, yeah, I think it's more. I think it's more science-y than that.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  But I think I just think it's a long, a long con.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.140]  I mean, this has been going on for years,
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.020]  and I just don't think that she would stick to it that long.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.700]  We're a couple of dipshits is a Christmas song.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.540]  They like they parodied. They're all related to the show in some way.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.940]  We should end this before this becomes the new longest.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.360]  It already is, but it's fine.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.900]  You got to cut out the first hour because f***ing.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.600]  No, I think it was really good.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.380]  We had updates.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.940]  Yeah, Geoff, you weren't here for it. You couldn't hear me.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.820]  I was saying it was like a choose your own adventure.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.940]  I was not talking when your thing would light up. It was a whole thing.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.320]  Oh, I heard some of that. Yeah.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.680]  No, he could hear you.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.680]  Wait, he can hear me.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.720]  I can hear you fine.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.300]  That's interesting. I thought we couldn't hear each other at all.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.880]  I thought it was two ways. I misunderstood that.
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.740]  Yeah, because he was responding to you.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.020]  Oh, that's less interesting.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:44.960]  I'm going to. All right.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.640]  Well, I'm excited to listen to these Christmas songs
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.920]  and what an amazing community and all that.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.560]  But I'm going to f***ing get up tomorrow morning and I'm going to take a shower
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.280]  and I'm going to get ready and I'm going to put my socks on my shoes on
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.660]  and I'm going to grab my left f***ing sock from my right foot.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:59.340]  And I'm going to be I'm going to feel like you guys are bad friends.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.940]  Because you did nothing to help.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.480]  You talked about it. So now tomorrow you grab the right sock.
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.300]  It's like you broke the curse.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.940]  If that happens, I'll I'll f***ing I'll do f***ing backflips.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.960]  Put a GoPro on your head.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.560]  I want to see the footage and I want to see how real this is.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.160]  Yes. And don't give any context.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:19.580]  Like just for a week. Just please do this.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.700]  Don't explain why you're doing it and be as irate as you are.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.260]  Yeah. Every day on Instagram.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.940]  Let's have a video of you putting on socks.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.920]  I'll try to remember. I'll put it on my phone.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.220]  What do you mean? Remember tomorrow?
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:30.820]  I'll put it on my phone.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.580]  Start tomorrow.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.220]  He'll be sat there with his right sock in his left hand thinking,
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.540]  Damn it. I forgot again.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.060]  Sock thing. Sock thing.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.320]  All right. All right. All right. All right.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.900]  All right. OK, cool.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.760]  So you said Eric is on this Christmas album?
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.380]  Yes. He has a small part.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.040]  What did you do, Eric?
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.980]  I think you have to listen to the whole album and find out.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:51.920]  That's a great point.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.180]  Did you perform an instrument?
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:54.040]  I did not.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.100]  What did you do, Andrew?
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.740]  I did some singing. I did a very brief amount of singing.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.140]  Guys, it's getting dark again.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.240]  I have an important question for Eric because Eric likes to yell and he wants this to end.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.860]  But this is I meant to bring this up earlier.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.900]  Do we continue to call it the sewing machine or do we now call it?
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.620]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.320]  Thank you for listening to F*** Face.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.200]  We'll see you guys later.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:16.880]  Thanks for listening.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.020]  Give us a five star rating.

[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.140]  Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho from everyone here at F*** Face.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.460]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.220]  We're not talking about the sewing machine or the icky shuffle.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.080]  No. Goodbye.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.720]  And P.S. We're living in a simulation.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.640]  Open your eyes. Look for the seams.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.860]  They're visible everywhere.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:35.800]  Pay attention.
