[00:00.460 --> 00:02.640]  This episode is brought to you by Corona.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.420]  When you're on a beach with an ice-cold Corona in hand,
[00:05.620 --> 00:06.860]  how can you not feel centered?
[00:07.080 --> 00:08.980]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[00:09.280 --> 00:12.320]  That's because whether after work, at barbecues, or at a bar,
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.940]  with just a squeeze of lime,
[00:14.060 --> 00:16.160]  Corona brings you La Playa mentality.
[00:16.620 --> 00:18.480]  Because while we all want the beach life,
[00:18.780 --> 00:21.000]  paradise doesn't always have palm trees.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.440]  Corona. La Playa awaits.
[00:23.700 --> 00:25.600]  Get yours at ordercorona.com.
[00:25.780 --> 00:26.520]  Relax responsibly.
[00:26.700 --> 00:27.340]  Corona Extra Beer.
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.040]  Imported by Crown Imports Chicago, Illinois.
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.520]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.420]  What you're about to hear was recorded just minutes after the last episode.
[00:48.820 --> 00:50.180]  I'm literally recording right now.
[00:50.280 --> 00:50.980]  So, fuck you.
[00:51.460 --> 00:52.300]  I'm rolling. I'm rolling.
[00:52.580 --> 00:53.360]  Yeah, so...
[00:53.360 --> 00:53.920]  I'm rolling, I guess.
[00:53.920 --> 00:54.760]  That was a great episode.
[00:55.180 --> 00:56.520]  What are we going to do here, Gavin?
[00:56.540 --> 00:57.640]  This is kind of your idea.
[00:57.820 --> 00:58.880]  I wish we weren't rolling.
[00:59.040 --> 00:59.960]  I wish I didn't make this a thing.
[01:00.080 --> 01:00.480]  I thought...
[01:00.480 --> 01:02.720]  Okay, I tried to come in and make a little quick joke.
[01:03.060 --> 01:04.600]  Eric didn't understand it twice.
[01:05.060 --> 01:07.300]  And now I've been here for like a minute.
[01:07.520 --> 01:08.860]  Because you came in...
[01:08.860 --> 01:09.800]  Do you know why I didn't understand?
[01:09.940 --> 01:11.320]  I'll tell you exactly why I didn't understand it.
[01:11.500 --> 01:14.540]  Because you came here earlier, way earlier.
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.820]  So, I assumed that you were plotting something with Andrew.
[01:19.040 --> 01:22.700]  So, that way after the episode is over, you leave and then come back.
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.100]  I understand what you're saying now.
[01:24.320 --> 01:24.800]  I get it now.
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.000]  It came from you constantly changing the time of the podcast.
[01:28.220 --> 01:28.780]  You changed it.
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.500]  We used to always be at three.
[01:30.780 --> 01:32.740]  And now we're always at 3.30.
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.210]  Constantly, constantly changing.
[01:35.760 --> 01:36.640]  The last three recordings.
[01:36.640 --> 01:38.940]  Yeah, and that's not constantly changing.
[01:39.120 --> 01:41.060]  We changed the time to 3.30.
[01:41.500 --> 01:41.880]  Why?
[01:42.220 --> 01:42.980]  A, why?
[01:43.360 --> 01:49.400]  And two, Andrew forgot and he was here 20 minutes early to the three o'clock recording.
[01:49.520 --> 01:50.580]  I'm very aware.
[01:50.880 --> 01:52.040]  And so, when I saw you...
[01:52.040 --> 01:58.660]  When I was here and I was in a meeting and I saw you jump in with Andrew and talk to him.
[01:58.740 --> 02:01.540]  And then all of a sudden you close out of this and come back in.
[02:01.640 --> 02:04.140]  I thought you guys were scheming something.
[02:04.140 --> 02:08.860]  Nope, I only went in with Andrew, which he thought was 20 minutes early.
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.400]  It was actually 50 minutes early.
[02:10.500 --> 02:12.700]  It's on your calendar.
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.480]  No, I only went in because you in the Discord wrote,
[02:17.780 --> 02:19.560]  you're here early talking to Andrew.
[02:19.720 --> 02:22.080]  So I was immediately alerted to Andrew being in.
[02:22.380 --> 02:23.440]  He was here early.
[02:23.820 --> 02:25.260]  I know that!
[02:25.580 --> 02:29.040]  So I came in to find out why he was early.
[02:29.140 --> 02:33.040]  And we discussed that he was not only early, he was early for the wrong time.
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.400]  So I was then trying to say to Andrew because Andrew was telling me I was early.
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.400]  And I was like, Andrew, this isn't early.
[02:39.440 --> 02:41.580]  I'm here at the wrong time.
[02:41.860 --> 02:44.540]  This is too early to be considered early for the recording.
[02:44.840 --> 02:49.700]  So just now, as a joke, I popped back in after we ended the last video.
[02:49.920 --> 02:52.120]  And I said, I'm here early for the next recording.
[02:52.420 --> 02:53.260]  Like a week early.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.580]  I understand that now.
[02:55.800 --> 03:01.100]  I hope that you see that this feels like a classic Andrew scheme
[03:01.100 --> 03:05.600]  where I got very worried that there was something being plotted against me,
[03:05.780 --> 03:06.780]  like Geoff and the bats.
[03:07.260 --> 03:08.180]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:08.420 --> 03:09.760]  That would never happen to you, Eric.
[03:10.320 --> 03:11.040]  Absolutely not.
[03:11.140 --> 03:11.940]  Oh my God.
[03:12.180 --> 03:13.700]  Why would you think that would happen to you?
[03:13.940 --> 03:17.320]  Can we talk about how are we going to get Geoff to only have left socks?
[03:17.600 --> 03:18.820]  How are we going to do this?
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.920]  That's all I've been thinking about.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.100]  How do we get rid of all of his right socks and only make sure he has left?
[03:24.140 --> 03:26.660]  We need to contact Emily or we need to contact Millie and say,
[03:26.780 --> 03:28.320]  you need to get rid of all of his right socks.
[03:28.320 --> 03:30.840]  But we need socks as a replacement.
[03:31.280 --> 03:33.480]  Oh, you're saying get more left socks.
[03:33.720 --> 03:37.920]  Yeah, like remove, not just steal his socks, replace them.
[03:38.060 --> 03:42.160]  You need a recon pass on all the socks he owns so you can buy the same pairs again.
[03:42.540 --> 03:44.880]  And then we need to swap out the rights for more lefts.
[03:45.120 --> 03:46.600]  That is actually a good point.
[03:46.700 --> 03:48.820]  It kind of implied he had old socks.
[03:49.200 --> 03:51.780]  We need to figure out if those socks are still in the rotation
[03:52.260 --> 03:54.060]  and then flip them if they are.
[03:54.480 --> 03:57.000]  If not, we need to somehow get him to change all his socks.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.880]  I was blown away that socks could have a left and a right.
[04:00.040 --> 04:00.700]  I didn't even know that was a thing.
[04:00.700 --> 04:01.480]  I've never heard of that.
[04:02.120 --> 04:02.920]  It's never heard of it.
[04:03.380 --> 04:08.060]  For like Argyle and like more really like dressier socks, they're just cut.
[04:08.240 --> 04:10.180]  So there's like a little bit of a curve.
[04:10.340 --> 04:14.560]  So like your big toe kind of goes where it's supposed to naturally go and whatever.
[04:14.960 --> 04:19.020]  But also like if it's causing him so much aggravation for,
[04:19.160 --> 04:21.920]  I mean, what he explained to be 30 plus years.
[04:22.620 --> 04:25.300]  What is he? Why would he keep the socks?
[04:25.300 --> 04:27.360]  Just get universal socks.
[04:27.580 --> 04:28.620]  It is strange.
[04:28.900 --> 04:32.100]  So when I joked that I was here early for next week's one.
[04:32.660 --> 04:33.740]  What is this now?
[04:34.220 --> 04:35.320]  This isn't next week's one.
[04:35.620 --> 04:36.900]  No, I think this is next week's one.
[04:37.020 --> 04:39.080]  How could it be? It can't possibly be.
[04:39.240 --> 04:40.640]  We can't start it without Geoff.
[04:41.040 --> 04:41.740]  I'm sure he'll.
[04:41.900 --> 04:43.360]  Why don't you text Geoff to come back?
[04:43.460 --> 04:43.980]  We've made it.
[04:44.200 --> 04:45.560]  No, it's dark, Andrew.
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.380]  I'm alone in the dark and I'm hungry again.
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.100]  It happened again.
[04:48.640 --> 04:51.380]  I think if we yell socks enough, he might just show up.
[04:51.440 --> 04:53.580]  I feel like that might be like a calling word for him.
[04:53.760 --> 04:54.960]  He did start without me once.
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.880]  That is a good point, Nick.
[04:55.960 --> 04:58.400]  That maybe maybe this is a midweek.
[04:58.720 --> 05:00.040]  Oh, wait, we are already midweek.
[05:00.160 --> 05:02.100]  Maybe this is a weekend snippet.
[05:02.100 --> 05:03.780]  Right. You throw it in on like a Saturday.
[05:04.500 --> 05:08.060]  Because you love like you would love a 30.5, wouldn't you?
[05:08.060 --> 05:09.640]  You'd love the way that messes with the.
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.660]  It's already fucked up.
[05:11.740 --> 05:12.400]  Who cares?
[05:12.840 --> 05:14.520]  It's already a fucking mess.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.420]  I mean, like his coin flip thing.
[05:18.500 --> 05:19.900]  I'm still not on board.
[05:20.160 --> 05:20.380]  I know.
[05:20.780 --> 05:21.640]  Thank you, Eric.
[05:21.900 --> 05:23.220]  It was that was in.
[05:23.220 --> 05:24.380]  That was really.
[05:24.600 --> 05:26.000]  Thank you, Gavin.
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.640]  You seem way too calm about that.
[05:27.760 --> 05:29.520]  I think is it was insanity.
[05:29.660 --> 05:33.860]  But I also had so many questions about I wanted it needs to go forward because.
[05:34.340 --> 05:35.320]  Yeah, it was insane.
[05:35.420 --> 05:36.520]  I was playing down.
[05:36.660 --> 05:38.700]  I regret playing down how insane that was.
[05:38.820 --> 05:41.040]  That was a complete 90 degree turn on that story.
[05:41.080 --> 05:41.980]  It was ridiculous.
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.920]  I was so deep into the coin thing.
[05:43.980 --> 05:46.140]  I was already thinking of things to say about the coins.
[05:46.260 --> 05:48.140]  I was thinking about solutions for the coins.
[05:48.340 --> 05:52.080]  When he said socks, if I had a mouthful of water, it would have gone all over my desk.
[05:52.080 --> 05:54.720]  Oh, I spit on my monitor at some point.
[05:54.840 --> 05:57.080]  I took like, I think it may have been the sock thing.
[05:57.160 --> 06:00.380]  I just filled my mouth with water and then he pivoted and I spit everywhere.
[06:00.520 --> 06:00.940]  Disgusting.
[06:01.040 --> 06:01.980]  Wasn't even a spit deck.
[06:02.300 --> 06:02.800]  The anger.
[06:03.160 --> 06:08.800]  The indignance that Andrew had for him saying socks was like.
[06:09.540 --> 06:10.020]  Outrageous.
[06:10.080 --> 06:12.220]  It was how cool.
[06:12.420 --> 06:16.960]  It was based around him thinking we wouldn't understand the concept of a 50-50 choice.
[06:16.980 --> 06:17.960]  What does that mean?
[06:18.740 --> 06:21.700]  And this coin story is way cooler than the sock story.
[06:21.700 --> 06:23.400]  Cooler than the sock story.
[06:23.580 --> 06:24.500]  It reversed.
[06:24.760 --> 06:26.820]  It's not a 50-50 chance.
[06:26.960 --> 06:27.960]  Because here's the thing.
[06:28.300 --> 06:30.380]  It's a 50-50 chance if you flip a coin.
[06:30.680 --> 06:38.280]  It's not a 50-50 chance to go into a drawer of socks and grab a sock and then pick a foot for it to go on.
[06:38.700 --> 06:40.060]  It doesn't make any sense.
[06:40.460 --> 06:41.940]  It's not flipping a coin.
[06:42.120 --> 06:47.600]  There's so many solutions, but I couldn't provide them because I was so distracted by the coin.
[06:47.940 --> 06:48.980]  And he was also saying.
[06:49.140 --> 06:49.480]  I had no room.
[06:49.480 --> 06:53.040]  He was explaining the coin like it was something he had to do every day.
[06:53.120 --> 06:54.640]  He was compelled to flip this coin.
[06:54.760 --> 06:55.380]  It was his thing.
[06:55.780 --> 06:57.800]  And then he said, I've been doing that with socks.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.500]  Immediately, I'm thinking he's flipping socks.
[07:01.640 --> 07:03.800]  He's like throwing socks up in the air before he puts them on.
[07:04.200 --> 07:06.000]  No, he's just putting on socks.
[07:06.460 --> 07:09.420]  There's no weirdness behind that.
[07:09.440 --> 07:10.420]  He's just getting dressed.
[07:10.980 --> 07:13.880]  Why did he get into the specifics of the Canadian dollar?
[07:14.240 --> 07:18.700]  Why did he like make a point of like what type of coin he was giving it?
[07:18.700 --> 07:21.960]  He was giving examples of other coins.
[07:22.120 --> 07:25.280]  He was trying to get us to visualize the coin.
[07:25.460 --> 07:31.360]  He would put so much effort into the coin thing for it to mean nothing, nothing at all.
[07:31.640 --> 07:32.480]  Zero purpose.
[07:32.760 --> 07:37.460]  Oh, this has been like a debrief on the last recording because we couldn't have it with
[07:37.460 --> 07:40.000]  Geoff here because he would just, you know, he's too close to it.
[07:40.260 --> 07:40.900]  It's true.
[07:41.040 --> 07:44.500]  We should start doing commentary tracks on our episodes.
[07:44.700 --> 07:47.560]  Oh, that's what this is.
[07:47.560 --> 07:51.580]  Can we can we insert a hidden like audio description?
[07:52.180 --> 07:55.740]  Do they have like accessibility tracks in podcasts that we can hide this on?
[07:56.100 --> 07:57.160]  I don't think we can.
[07:57.300 --> 08:05.060]  But what we can do is release this as a Saturday like compendium for like it's just like it's
[08:05.060 --> 08:13.840]  like play this on your like play the episode on your like computer and then load this compendium
[08:13.840 --> 08:18.260]  on your phone and we'll be debriefing and doing commentary on the episode.
[08:18.460 --> 08:19.600]  I feel like that's right.
[08:19.960 --> 08:21.200]  Yeah, I think we do that.
[08:21.200 --> 08:24.820]  Or do we just attach this to the front of the next episode?
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.240]  Don't tell Geoff at all.
[08:26.620 --> 08:27.700]  And he finds out about it.
[08:28.180 --> 08:29.060]  That's the longest.
[08:29.300 --> 08:32.400]  Why do you guys insist on making these like the longest episodes?
[08:32.560 --> 08:34.320]  Because we'll just make it shorter.
[08:34.420 --> 08:37.060]  We'll just like Gavin will just be like, we already got 10 minutes.
[08:37.140 --> 08:37.900]  Yeah, well, it's fine.
[08:38.060 --> 08:38.680]  Oh, my God.
[08:38.720 --> 08:39.220]  No, that one.
[08:39.280 --> 08:39.800]  No, we can't.
[08:39.840 --> 08:40.840]  We don't have that kind of control.
[08:40.940 --> 08:42.340]  Andrew, this podcast was over.
[08:42.340 --> 08:44.420]  And then Geoff talked about coins.
[08:44.700 --> 08:50.520]  I think it's funnier if it's on the next episode and we're it's like a completely different pivot.
[08:50.800 --> 08:52.020]  And then the episode starts.
[08:52.100 --> 08:56.240]  And Geoff has no idea that it's 10 minutes of calling him a lunatic because of his coin.
[08:57.340 --> 09:00.480]  I think that's funnier than just releasing this randomly on a
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.060]  Saturday because then we're just going to talk about it on the next recording anyway.
[09:05.600 --> 09:06.120]  Interesting.
[09:06.840 --> 09:08.220]  No, I understand your point.
[09:08.380 --> 09:09.280]  I think it's a strong point.
[09:10.140 --> 09:12.780]  What if this is very dismissive?
[09:13.060 --> 09:14.320]  That's like you're full of shit.
[09:14.400 --> 09:15.940]  I'm not going to do what you're saying.
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.040]  But what if we do this?
[09:17.120 --> 09:20.480]  What if we do this at the end of the one that we just finished recording?
[09:21.640 --> 09:27.920]  Eric records a bit saying that bit was so insane that we had to wait for Geoff to leave
[09:27.920 --> 09:29.140]  so we could talk about it.
[09:29.180 --> 09:31.000]  And that bit is on our website.
[09:31.700 --> 09:32.100]  Wow.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.440]  Andrew was not into that idea.
[09:35.880 --> 09:37.400]  Like, not into that.
[09:37.940 --> 09:38.720]  Loud and clear.
[09:39.800 --> 09:40.960]  It's not a bad idea.
[09:41.060 --> 09:43.420]  I just think it's the least funny of the options so far.
[09:43.520 --> 09:44.400]  Oh, yeah, it's not funny.
[09:44.640 --> 09:45.180]  I was just...
[09:45.180 --> 09:45.280]  No.
[09:45.520 --> 09:46.560]  Well, then why are we doing it?
[09:46.580 --> 09:48.260]  I feel like the point of this is to be funny.
[09:48.360 --> 09:49.220]  This is a funny thing.
[09:49.360 --> 09:49.520]  Yeah.
[09:50.020 --> 09:54.040]  The point of this is not to drive people to our website like every other piece of content.
[09:54.180 --> 09:55.780]  The point is to face us.
[09:55.880 --> 09:56.700]  You're absolutely right, Andrew.
[09:56.820 --> 09:58.820]  It was actually a terrible idea.
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.080]  I mean, it was a good idea for literally anything else we do.
[10:03.240 --> 10:04.620]  But it's the wrong show.
[10:04.840 --> 10:05.060]  Correct.
[10:05.140 --> 10:06.860]  It was a good idea for any other show.
[10:07.800 --> 10:08.440]  That's right.
[10:08.760 --> 10:08.880]  Yeah.
[10:09.180 --> 10:10.840]  This is all about pursuing funny.
[10:11.180 --> 10:16.640]  Why is he still not in his office?
[10:17.560 --> 10:18.340]  I don't understand.
[10:18.680 --> 10:19.450]  It was like...
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.500]  Because he's incapable of moving his leg without bashing his knee if there's a thing in the middle.
[10:26.140 --> 10:27.980]  That was one of those physical moments.
[10:28.180 --> 10:31.320]  When he explained that, was your first thought also,
[10:31.520 --> 10:34.440]  well, you're gonna hit your head when you go underneath the desk or something?
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.740]  Like, he's gonna hurt himself still.
[10:36.740 --> 10:37.980]  Oh, absolutely.
[10:38.460 --> 10:39.720]  Wait, what's he gonna hit his head on?
[10:39.880 --> 10:41.560]  Oh, he's gonna go underneath his desk.
[10:41.740 --> 10:43.560]  He's gonna drop a pen down there or something.
[10:43.940 --> 10:45.780]  And it's gonna be a thing where it's like,
[10:45.820 --> 10:47.400]  well, I won't bang my knee against the pole.
[10:47.580 --> 10:48.280]  It doesn't matter.
[10:48.620 --> 10:51.440]  He's still gonna like bang his head on like the underside of the desk,
[10:51.580 --> 10:53.480]  grabbing like a dollar that he dropped or something.
[10:53.940 --> 10:55.000]  Like, he's trying to...
[10:55.000 --> 10:55.580]  Yeah, like the coin he flipped.
[10:58.400 --> 11:01.440]  His left sock is gonna roll underneath the desk.
[11:04.220 --> 11:07.660]  He's trying to solve a problem that will come back to get him no matter what.
[11:08.640 --> 11:10.780]  I think that was a good debrief over the last episode.
[11:10.780 --> 11:11.600]  I think that was good, too.
[11:11.720 --> 11:12.620]  We just need to decide.
[11:12.720 --> 11:16.760]  I really think it would make me so fucking happy to record the next episode
[11:16.760 --> 11:19.280]  knowing that this is the start of it and Geoff has no idea.
[11:19.520 --> 11:20.100]  I'm fine with that.
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.220]  If you want to, I'm not opposed to it.
[11:22.520 --> 11:23.480]  Are you okay with it, Gavin?
[11:23.660 --> 11:24.820]  Because I just think that'll be...
[11:24.820 --> 11:28.400]  I think it'd be so much fun to know that this is there and he doesn't.
[11:28.420 --> 11:30.880]  Why don't we play it for him?
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.700]  It's kind of long, isn't it?
[11:32.820 --> 11:35.640]  Yeah, we're 11 minutes in, Gavin.
[11:35.900 --> 11:36.860]  This is not a clip.
[11:37.320 --> 11:39.580]  This is like a portion of an episode.
[11:40.120 --> 11:44.520]  We could edit together a little trailer of it so he knows what we talked about.
[11:44.720 --> 11:47.420]  Who is going to edit together a little trailer?
[11:47.860 --> 11:53.860]  I think the paranoia is better.
[11:54.080 --> 11:56.080]  I don't think he should know anything about this.
[11:56.200 --> 11:56.380]  I think it's the bad thing once again.
[11:56.380 --> 12:01.300]  The only reason I worry about that is that when Geoff thinks he's being messed with,
[12:01.300 --> 12:03.920]  he shuts down and he gets really crappy.
[12:05.900 --> 12:09.740]  And we could potentially ruin ourselves for some good Geoff
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.520]  if we tell him right at the beginning.
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.440]  Well, then don't tell him at the beginning, tell him at the end.
[12:13.440 --> 12:14.900]  Yeah, I think we tell him at the end.
[12:15.020 --> 12:17.120]  I think literally like nothing has happened.
[12:17.640 --> 12:20.560]  It's... hey guys, thank you so much for listening to this episode of F*** Face.
[12:20.660 --> 12:23.780]  By the way, the first 19 minutes of this episode...
[12:27.120 --> 12:29.160]  I think that's what you have to do.
[12:29.160 --> 12:32.720]  One of you has to volunteer to do the outro at a certain time.
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.320]  It's got to be early.
[12:34.540 --> 12:39.860]  Like 35 minutes in, like absurdly early, just like force the end.
[12:40.220 --> 12:42.060]  Because we're going to probably do two anyway.
[12:42.220 --> 12:45.100]  I feel bad, though, because people come to this podcast
[12:45.100 --> 12:46.900]  because it's the only place they get Geoff.
[12:47.260 --> 12:50.440]  And we just did half of it without him when he was completely available.
[12:50.820 --> 12:54.680]  No, Gavin, you're... no, see, you're... I understand what you're saying.
[12:54.860 --> 12:57.280]  However, in the episode that we're debriefing from,
[12:57.280 --> 13:00.460]  he did say that he has stepped out on this podcast
[13:00.460 --> 13:03.280]  and has begun recording another podcast where they can get more Geoff.
[13:03.520 --> 13:04.580]  That's true. That's what he gets there.
[13:04.580 --> 13:04.920]  That's a great point.
[13:05.380 --> 13:05.660]  So...
[13:05.660 --> 13:07.780]  He's made himself less important in this one.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.660]  That's it. That's all. I'm not saying. I'm just saying, you know?
[13:11.040 --> 13:13.520]  OK, I'm never going to leave.
[13:13.620 --> 13:17.540]  I'm going to sit in the recording area now for an hour after every podcast
[13:17.540 --> 13:18.720]  because there's no trust.
[13:18.920 --> 13:22.180]  We've just established a new layer of no trust that cannot be reversed.
[13:22.900 --> 13:25.360]  This is really something. This is a different level.
[13:25.780 --> 13:27.020]  This is really a different level.
[13:27.020 --> 13:28.120]  This is something else.
[13:28.220 --> 13:31.460]  How did you notice Andrew in the thing earlier?
[13:31.860 --> 13:35.600]  Because I was sitting in here because I thought I might be late because I had a meeting.
[13:35.980 --> 13:38.260]  So I was getting out of one meeting into the next one.
[13:38.640 --> 13:42.120]  And I just saw like I had it at the ready, like everything was ready to go.
[13:42.200 --> 13:42.480]  Ah.
[13:42.680 --> 13:43.900]  So I could come in and hit record.
[13:44.260 --> 13:46.520]  But then I noticed all of a sudden he's in the audio thing.
[13:46.540 --> 13:47.400]  And I'm like, oh shit.
[13:47.500 --> 13:51.220]  But then Gavin was in and I got like in this meeting.
[13:51.220 --> 13:55.860]  I had my camera on and I was looking in this meeting and then all of a sudden
[13:55.860 --> 13:57.960]  panicked, like looking at like my second monitor.
[13:59.100 --> 14:01.400]  It was really, man, it was something.
[14:01.840 --> 14:03.140]  It was making me worried.
[14:03.240 --> 14:03.520]  It was great.
[14:03.540 --> 14:03.800]  Oh boy.
[14:03.920 --> 14:06.020]  This could never happen if we were recording in real life.
[14:06.280 --> 14:06.540]  No.
[14:06.600 --> 14:08.420]  Unless someone like went into the room early.
[14:08.740 --> 14:09.560]  No, yeah, right.
[14:09.700 --> 14:12.100]  It would be a thing where Geoff left.
[14:12.200 --> 14:13.520]  He's like in a hurry to get out.
[14:13.660 --> 14:17.240]  And then you just walked out to get a soda and then came back in and we went.
[14:18.380 --> 14:22.620]  We just like all pretended to walk out and he gets in his car and we all just come back in.
[14:25.780 --> 14:28.460]  Well, I think this is a good starting point for this episode.
[14:28.540 --> 14:30.660]  I hope you guys enjoy episode 31 of F*** Face.
[14:31.160 --> 14:34.260]  And I don't know who's doing the intro, but I hope it's a good one.
[14:34.760 --> 14:36.580]  Oh, what do you think we're going to talk about, Gavin?
[14:36.760 --> 14:37.400]  Oh, Jesus.
[14:37.500 --> 14:38.340]  You have anything lined up?
[14:38.400 --> 14:38.860]  No, it's quick.
[14:38.880 --> 14:41.080]  You try to debrief the next episode.
[14:41.480 --> 14:46.680]  Yeah, I'm saying like, what do you think will be a subject we touch on next week?
[14:47.040 --> 14:47.660]  Next episode?
[14:48.460 --> 14:51.700]  Oh, it'll be right before New Year's.
[14:51.720 --> 14:52.600]  It'll be on the 30th.
[14:53.120 --> 14:56.540]  Yeah, that will be the episode release.
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.360]  Yeah, I think we'll be back on sewing machine because that was what was at the end of this.
[15:00.480 --> 15:01.700]  That is a great thing.
[15:01.800 --> 15:04.100]  Yeah, we need to talk about that because I really have a question.
[15:04.220 --> 15:05.220]  I'm not trying to fight you, Eric.
[15:05.280 --> 15:06.480]  It's just I think I have a point.
[15:06.700 --> 15:08.540]  I'm just curious what your thoughts are.
[15:08.760 --> 15:09.100]  All right.
[15:09.120 --> 15:14.280]  So why don't you why don't you hand it off now to yourself in the future?
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.660]  Oh, I like this.
[15:16.900 --> 15:21.140]  Take it with the intro, followed by the sewing machine, Andrew.
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.420]  Okay, wait, wait, wait a second.
[15:22.520 --> 15:22.820]  Wait a second.
[15:22.900 --> 15:23.360]  I'm lining up.
[15:23.480 --> 15:23.840]  I'm lining up.
[15:23.900 --> 15:24.580]  I'm throwing it.
[15:26.340 --> 15:27.360]  Oh, this is good.
[15:27.380 --> 15:28.100]  You're going to catch it.
[15:28.140 --> 15:28.840]  You're going to catch it.
[15:28.840 --> 15:30.680]  You're going to catch it next week.
[15:30.780 --> 15:31.860]  I'm going to catch it next week.
[15:32.120 --> 15:33.400]  I'm going to catch it next week.
[15:33.660 --> 15:34.660]  That ball's in the air.
[15:34.820 --> 15:35.540]  It's flying.
[15:35.800 --> 15:36.520]  That's fucking great.
[15:36.760 --> 15:37.920]  Wait, wait.
[15:38.080 --> 15:38.640]  Here it comes.
[15:39.260 --> 15:39.820]  Here it comes.
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.680]  And I caught it.
[15:41.820 --> 15:42.120]  I caught it.
[15:42.120 --> 15:43.040]  Gavin, you see that catch?
[15:43.300 --> 15:43.660]  Nice catch, dude.
[15:43.660 --> 15:44.620]  You see that catch, Gavin?
[15:45.300 --> 15:46.020]  Fantastic catch.
[15:46.320 --> 15:47.380]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[15:47.400 --> 15:47.800]  Take it away.
[15:48.340 --> 15:49.100]  I dropped the ball.
[15:49.500 --> 15:49.980]  In what way?
[15:50.080 --> 15:50.540]  In what sense?
[15:51.620 --> 15:52.740]  I didn't catch it.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.600]  I dropped it.
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.700]  Oh, it wasn't going for you.
[15:54.780 --> 15:55.480]  It was going for me.
[15:55.620 --> 15:57.220]  It was a toss to myself.
[15:57.580 --> 15:58.540]  I caught it perfectly.
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.760]  I had another ball and I dropped it.
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.360]  It rolled under the bed.
[16:03.400 --> 16:05.340]  I can't even get to the ball now without a broom handle.
[16:05.560 --> 16:07.760]  You threw it, caught it, stood next to Geoff.
[16:07.860 --> 16:08.680]  He dropped his ball.
[16:09.160 --> 16:10.300]  Yeah, and you didn't even throw it.
[16:10.600 --> 16:11.120]  How embarrassing.
[16:11.480 --> 16:13.120]  You're just holding a ball that slipped from your hand.
[16:13.400 --> 16:14.140]  Tell me about it.
[16:14.220 --> 16:15.220]  I'm the one that's happening to you.
[16:15.260 --> 16:15.980]  I'm living it right now.
[16:16.320 --> 16:16.480]  Yeah.
[16:16.520 --> 16:17.640]  This is my hell.
[16:17.940 --> 16:18.320]  It is.
[16:18.860 --> 16:19.380]  How's your day going?
[16:19.420 --> 16:19.700]  Okay.
[16:19.700 --> 16:21.220]  Was that what I was supposed to do?
[16:21.280 --> 16:22.220]  What the fuck was that?
[16:22.700 --> 16:23.720]  No, don't worry about it.
[16:23.880 --> 16:24.520]  We're good.
[16:24.740 --> 16:24.820]  Huh?
[16:24.920 --> 16:26.160]  Just show as normal now.
[16:26.260 --> 16:26.480]  Continue.
[16:26.880 --> 16:27.260]  What's up?
[16:27.760 --> 16:28.600]  What is that about?
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.220]  What do you mean what is that about?
[16:30.960 --> 16:31.760]  What is...
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.360]  Gavin, what is going on here?
[16:33.540 --> 16:34.580]  Don't worry about it.
[16:34.840 --> 16:35.700]  Andrew, I told you.
[16:36.160 --> 16:36.760]  Yeah, you're right.
[16:36.960 --> 16:37.980]  Gavin, you're totally right.
[16:38.100 --> 16:38.480]  But it's fine.
[16:38.620 --> 16:39.800]  Geoff, let's just go.
[16:40.320 --> 16:40.720]  Start.
[16:40.980 --> 16:41.960]  What did he tell you?
[16:42.260 --> 16:43.140]  I know my Geoff.
[16:43.540 --> 16:43.820]  Yeah.
[16:44.800 --> 16:46.240]  What did you say I would do?
[16:46.600 --> 16:46.820]  Nothing.
[16:47.060 --> 16:47.300]  Crappy.
[16:52.320 --> 16:53.620]  Do we do...
[16:53.620 --> 16:55.780]  Well, I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[16:55.880 --> 16:56.840]  All right, don't worry about it.
[16:57.000 --> 16:57.320]  It's great.
[16:57.520 --> 16:58.320]  We should just tell him.
[16:58.380 --> 16:59.400]  No, I don't think so.
[16:59.640 --> 17:00.440]  I don't think we need to.
[17:00.480 --> 17:01.020]  Nothing happened.
[17:01.440 --> 17:02.060]  Tell him about what?
[17:02.140 --> 17:02.280]  Okay.
[17:03.320 --> 17:03.680]  Well...
[17:03.680 --> 17:07.120]  Do we tell him that we were going to pretend that something happened?
[17:07.120 --> 17:10.460]  I don't know if you'll get a full real episode out of Geoff without telling him.
[17:11.380 --> 17:13.460]  Well, I think...
[17:13.460 --> 17:14.080]  Do we...
[17:14.080 --> 17:14.980]  Do we tell him?
[17:15.640 --> 17:16.420]  Eric, what do you think?
[17:16.960 --> 17:18.360]  Or do we pretend...
[17:18.360 --> 17:19.300]  Because nothing happened.
[17:19.300 --> 17:19.880]  Geoff.
[17:20.400 --> 17:21.500]  Or did something happen?
[17:22.160 --> 17:22.640]  I...
[17:22.640 --> 17:24.660]  Geoff has shut down.
[17:24.860 --> 17:26.260]  I think you have to.
[17:26.520 --> 17:27.420]  Yeah, it's exactly...
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.400]  That's exactly what I was saying.
[17:28.900 --> 17:29.360]  He's gone?
[17:31.060 --> 17:31.700]  I'm here.
[17:31.960 --> 17:32.500]  Oh, okay.
[17:33.320 --> 17:34.980]  Listen to that even tone.
[17:35.280 --> 17:36.480]  Listen to his tone.
[17:37.560 --> 17:38.960]  Nick said he's gone.
[17:39.280 --> 17:40.000]  So I was kind of...
[17:40.000 --> 17:40.580]  He actually left.
[17:40.720 --> 17:43.120]  And then he qualified that with mentally.
[17:43.440 --> 17:43.580]  Okay.
[17:44.040 --> 17:44.240]  Yeah.
[17:44.740 --> 17:44.860]  Yeah.
[17:45.040 --> 17:47.540]  This is a really weird part of the show.
[17:47.800 --> 17:48.360]  This is strange.
[17:48.460 --> 17:49.160]  This is a weird opening.
[17:49.300 --> 17:50.400]  It was your opening.
[17:50.520 --> 17:51.460]  I'd like you to continue.
[17:51.660 --> 17:55.040]  I think that was a worse minute than last week's bad minute.
[17:55.280 --> 17:56.140]  Oh, I don't...
[17:56.140 --> 17:57.840]  We're not getting into the minute thing again.
[17:58.260 --> 17:59.240]  A minute is unreasonable.
[17:59.860 --> 18:01.180]  It's an unreasonable request.
[18:01.740 --> 18:02.960]  Do you want to do the intro to the show, Geoff?
[18:03.300 --> 18:04.320]  You do a great job.
[18:04.760 --> 18:05.300]  Really good at it.
[18:05.500 --> 18:06.640]  Would you like me to do...
[18:06.640 --> 18:09.060]  Is you're saying it's time for me to do the intro?
[18:09.440 --> 18:10.460]  Yeah, I think we should do the intro.
[18:10.620 --> 18:10.760]  Sure.
[18:11.340 --> 18:11.500]  Yeah.
[18:11.700 --> 18:13.640]  Hello and welcome to episode...
[18:13.640 --> 18:18.340]  I believe it's 31 of F*** Face podcast starring myself, Geoff Ramsey.
[18:20.060 --> 18:23.140]  Also, my friend Gavin Free and co-worker Andrew Pan.
[18:24.420 --> 18:28.860]  Compare the energy levels between that one and the full stock that was like four minutes ago.
[18:29.180 --> 18:31.040]  And that's exactly what I'm talking about, Andrew.
[18:31.300 --> 18:32.220]  He's very defensive.
[18:32.540 --> 18:33.260]  It is interesting.
[18:33.580 --> 18:34.980]  It is a weirdly guarded...
[18:34.980 --> 18:36.400]  That was a weirdly guarded intro, Geoff.
[18:36.880 --> 18:37.860]  And I noticed the co-worker.
[18:38.400 --> 18:39.200]  I don't get...
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.340]  I get the shaft on the credits, the co-credit.
[18:42.720 --> 18:43.880]  Just trying to cover all the bases.
[18:45.340 --> 18:47.140]  How's your week so far?
[18:47.340 --> 18:48.660]  It's been a while since we talked, Andrew.
[18:48.660 --> 18:49.640]  What's going on in your world?
[18:50.520 --> 18:52.200]  I'm doing pretty good.
[18:52.940 --> 18:53.620]  That's great.
[18:53.700 --> 18:54.540]  Gavin, how about you?
[18:54.840 --> 18:55.900]  Oh, no, you have more to go?
[18:56.100 --> 18:56.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:57.220 --> 18:59.360]  I have a question, Gavin, for you.
[18:59.700 --> 18:59.880]  Yeah.
[19:00.120 --> 19:02.180]  Have you been flipping coins recently?
[19:02.400 --> 19:03.480]  How's your coin flipping going?
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.860]  No, I haven't flipped any coins.
[19:05.200 --> 19:05.540]  Really?
[19:05.980 --> 19:10.360]  I've been flipping a coin every day since we last recorded.
[19:10.980 --> 19:13.920]  And let me tell you, it's landed about heads to tails equally.
[19:14.800 --> 19:15.680]  Completely uneventful.
[19:16.020 --> 19:17.460]  Yeah, nothing going on.
[19:17.460 --> 19:21.300]  Thank you for proving my point that it's highly improbable
[19:21.300 --> 19:24.240]  that I would always put the left sock on the right foot.
[19:24.420 --> 19:27.020]  Now that you've mentioned it publicly and you've brought it,
[19:27.100 --> 19:29.960]  you've made it real by talking about the sock thing, has it continued?
[19:30.480 --> 19:30.780]  Yes.
[19:32.440 --> 19:32.840]  Yes.
[19:34.260 --> 19:36.100]  And I continue, I continue...
[19:37.120 --> 19:37.960]  Oh, hold one.
[19:38.080 --> 19:39.640]  My dog demands my attention.
[19:40.080 --> 19:40.920]  I'll be right back.
[19:41.020 --> 19:42.260]  I don't want to let the dog wait.
[19:42.620 --> 19:42.900]  What?
[19:43.780 --> 19:44.980]  All right, yeah, Andrew, you've got to tell him.
[19:45.060 --> 19:46.300]  Yeah, you have to tell him now.
[19:47.140 --> 19:49.900]  This is all we're going to get. We have to do two episodes.
[19:50.520 --> 19:53.020]  I told you last week this is what would happen.
[19:53.140 --> 19:54.140]  I do it instead.
[19:55.060 --> 19:56.000]  What is happening?
[19:56.420 --> 20:00.080]  You can't let his guard down. He doesn't know what's going on. You have to tell him.
[20:00.700 --> 20:01.240]  I've returned.
[20:03.340 --> 20:04.320]  But nothing happened.
[20:05.960 --> 20:11.360]  Yeah, I believe we were talking about sock things continuing unabated as always.
[20:11.700 --> 20:15.560]  I have discovered that I do have a few pairs of socks that don't have L's and R's on them.
[20:15.560 --> 20:22.400]  So those days when I have the privilege of noticing, they make the day go a little easier.
[20:23.100 --> 20:24.700]  Well, how about you, Gavin? What's going on in your world?
[20:25.060 --> 20:26.660]  I've got some stuff to talk about.
[20:26.940 --> 20:31.740]  Well, I mean, what do we want? How do we want to do this?
[20:32.100 --> 20:35.720]  This is a weird duel. I feel like we all have stuff, but nobody wants to lead with it.
[20:36.380 --> 20:38.260]  Well, I feel like we're not really in the show yet.
[20:38.620 --> 20:40.800]  You're not? You think Geoff is still...
[20:40.800 --> 20:43.040]  It's still started, obviously. This is in the show.
[20:43.040 --> 20:46.460]  I already did the intro. I believe I covered all the basics.
[20:47.140 --> 20:50.280]  Yeah. Geoff, you sound still very guarded. Is everything okay?
[20:50.640 --> 20:54.180]  I don't know what you mean by guarded. I'm just Geoff, man.
[20:54.940 --> 20:55.860]  I don't know about that.
[20:55.920 --> 20:58.380]  Known me for a long time. Same voice.
[20:58.540 --> 20:58.940]  I have.
[20:59.140 --> 21:02.080]  Same wacky sense of humor. Same everything.
[21:02.860 --> 21:04.660]  This is a different tone. This is an interesting tone.
[21:05.660 --> 21:08.360]  Gavin, you're right. You're right. I was wrong.
[21:08.920 --> 21:11.700]  But surely we can't explain what has happened.
[21:11.700 --> 21:12.500]  No, you can.
[21:12.880 --> 21:17.740]  No, can't we? Because then how long are we going to talk about that? We're running out of show.
[21:20.540 --> 21:23.800]  See, I burped. Look, I had potty humor. That's what I do.
[21:24.060 --> 21:27.840]  Okay, we have to talk about it. We have no choice. It must be talked about.
[21:28.620 --> 21:31.680]  Do you want to talk? Because it was kind of your thing, Gavin. I'm going to blame you for this.
[21:31.760 --> 21:33.180]  This is your creation.
[21:33.620 --> 21:33.900]  You're doing it.
[21:34.160 --> 21:35.100]  Inadvertently, sure. Yeah.
[21:35.420 --> 21:39.620]  Yeah. So do you want to not talk about it? I just threw the ball to you and you're like,
[21:39.680 --> 21:40.980]  yeah, I agree. And then nothing.
[21:40.980 --> 21:42.640]  I dropped the ball. What did you do?
[21:42.720 --> 21:44.660]  Yeah, you did. Okay, well...
[21:45.360 --> 21:49.220]  Did your ball roll under your couch too? Would you like to borrow my broom handle?
[21:50.180 --> 21:55.000]  As you know, Geoff, maybe you don't know. Did we talk about it last time? I showed up
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.760]  50 minutes late because I thought we were recording at 1 and I was early for the 1.
[22:00.220 --> 22:03.700]  Yeah. And then Gavin came in and said I was too early to be early
[22:03.700 --> 22:06.240]  because the recording's at 1.30 and that doesn't count.
[22:06.640 --> 22:09.280]  Yeah. I said that's not early. That's just the wrong time.
[22:09.600 --> 22:09.920]  Yes.
[22:09.920 --> 22:11.220]  That's correct. Yes.
[22:11.300 --> 22:16.420]  Did not count. So then we recorded a show. Great episode. I thought it was really good.
[22:17.460 --> 22:22.180]  Christmas episode. The intro song, fantastic as well. We should talk about that after.
[22:22.940 --> 22:26.800]  But what was I saying? What was I talking about? Oh, Gavin left. Okay,
[22:26.900 --> 22:29.720]  so we stopped recording, right? And then you left because we were done.
[22:30.360 --> 22:35.920]  And then Gavin came back after you left to do the joke that he was here for next week's recording.
[22:36.160 --> 22:39.080]  Yeah, I thought it'd be funny and just show up immediately after we ended being like,
[22:39.080 --> 22:44.580]  all right, I'm here early for next week. But that just confused Eric because Eric thought,
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.640]  I thought we were recording another episode then. So then we got into an argument. We got into an
[22:50.640 --> 22:54.300]  argument about how Eric was dumb and he didn't get my joke because I was just trying to say that
[22:54.300 --> 22:58.900]  and then nip straight back out because, you know, the rest of the day to continue living in.
[22:59.060 --> 23:05.760]  And then we just started arguing for a little bit. And then we just, we started to debrief
[23:05.760 --> 23:09.620]  over what you were talking about, Geoff, but with the coin flip thing, how you were
[23:09.620 --> 23:15.480]  linking the sock thing to the coin thing. And it went on like 15 extra minutes.
[23:16.040 --> 23:21.280]  And so after last week's episode, after I bitched out or I'm sorry, I peaced out
[23:21.280 --> 23:24.700]  because I fulfilled my obligation. You guys did a whole other podcast.
[23:25.100 --> 23:30.180]  We unintentionally did a continuation. And then we couldn't decide where it would go. Like,
[23:30.200 --> 23:35.240]  did we put it on the end of last one or do we cut it and then put it on the beginning of this one?
[23:35.240 --> 23:40.260]  And I think we determined that we'll put it on the beginning of this one and that Andrew should
[23:40.260 --> 23:44.740]  sort of throw the ball to himself a week in the future, which he did. He caught the ball,
[23:44.880 --> 23:49.000]  but I did warn him that if you didn't know what was going on, you would shut down.
[23:50.960 --> 23:56.200]  I denied this. I thought Geoff would be fine. And then we have five minutes of what this show is.
[23:56.360 --> 24:02.940]  So, so far, this episode is like 15 minutes of us talking about the end of the previous episode
[24:02.940 --> 24:09.600]  and then 15 more minutes of us talking about the debrief of our debrief to Geoff. This is truly
[24:09.600 --> 24:15.160]  an episode of nothing. In summary, you're not being pranked or anything like that. No. Oh,
[24:15.220 --> 24:20.560]  it's fine. Here's what happened. You guys, I realized I was in the middle of a bit I wasn't
[24:20.560 --> 24:27.100]  aware of instantly, obviously, because I'm not stupid. And then I saw Gavin's reaction of
[24:27.100 --> 24:34.000]  thinking I wasn't going to play along. So I didn't. Yeah. Gavin's the reason I didn't play
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.780]  along there. So I was right because I made myself right. Yeah, you created my response. You're just
[24:41.780 --> 24:46.380]  so ready to go with whatever's happening that... And then once I started with it, you know, I have
[24:46.380 --> 24:50.820]  that, uh, I can't, I can't bail out of something. Yeah, obviously. When I'm in a bit. I could have,
[24:50.840 --> 24:54.340]  I would have had to, unfortunately, if you guys had, and I'm really, thank you, by the way.
[24:54.340 --> 24:58.580]  Thanks for ending it when you did, uh, because I would have gone for the full two episodes
[24:58.580 --> 25:03.660]  like that. And I was not looking forward to it. I was beginning to feel bad that we, uh, we started
[25:03.660 --> 25:07.720]  the episode by debriefing the debrief and then the rest of the episode would have just been
[25:08.500 --> 25:13.320]  awkward silence, mostly. And I just felt bad for the audience, to be honest. I was starting to feel
[25:13.320 --> 25:20.420]  bad for the audience too. Here's the, here's the deal. I fucked up last episode in one big way.
[25:20.420 --> 25:27.820]  I was so overwhelmed with the improbability of the issue that I have, uh, regarding my socks
[25:27.820 --> 25:34.060]  and my feet, which by the way, I still am. It's still plaguing me. Um, and I've, I've still gotten,
[25:34.220 --> 25:38.980]  uh, no help or relief from either of you other than Andrew trying to, to try to figure out a way
[25:38.980 --> 25:46.980]  to make money off my feet. What? What? That is such a gross mischaracterization of what happened.
[25:46.980 --> 25:54.100]  I'm the fucking nicest friend you have, and I took your bullshit sock issue seriously. I sent you so
[25:54.100 --> 25:59.060]  many messages of like, what if we tried this? What if we tried this? What about this system?
[25:59.300 --> 26:05.700]  You are ridiculous. I think the best option is that we sell, we make f*** face socks that just
[26:05.700 --> 26:13.560]  say L on both foot. That's actually part of the debrief, Geoff. That's in the debrief. We talk
[26:13.560 --> 26:19.140]  about that. Getting you only left socks. Yeah, only left socks. Uh, anyway, I was so overcome
[26:19.720 --> 26:27.060]  that Andrew dropped one of the coolest things that has ever happened on us in the form of the
[26:27.060 --> 26:32.900]  fucking f*** face Christmas album. And I just glossed over it because I was so overcome with
[26:32.900 --> 26:37.740]  my own pain. Uh, but after the episode I listened to, I guess while you guys were doing the rest of
[26:37.740 --> 26:44.740]  the episode, I listened to it. I've been listening to it non-fucking-stop. It's phenomenal. Everybody
[26:44.740 --> 26:51.180]  involved with that thing is so talented and so clever. And it's, it's got so many inside jokes
[26:51.180 --> 26:56.580]  that like, by like, you're still picking stuff out the third listen through, you know? So you like
[26:56.580 --> 27:01.040]  appreciate it a little differently each time. It's, they did a really great job. And the whole time,
[27:01.100 --> 27:07.020]  we can get into it. I made, or I say I, Emily and I cooked, spent all day Sunday baking
[27:07.020 --> 27:11.480]  cookies, like different, like five, six different kinds of cookies, made like hundreds upon hundreds
[27:11.480 --> 27:16.540]  of cookies. And then we packaged them up in little boxes and we, we gave them out to people. And, uh,
[27:16.540 --> 27:20.860]  the entire time we were making cookies, we were listening to, I was singing along to like,
[27:20.920 --> 27:27.860]  we're a couple of dipshits. And, and, uh, do you want to make a podcast and stuff? It's really,
[27:27.980 --> 27:33.380]  really great. And it also, uh, once again, pisses me the f*** off that, uh, that life is unfair
[27:33.380 --> 27:39.040]  because I get reminded constantly that everybody on earth can sing but me.
[27:41.160 --> 27:47.220]  It makes me so mad. I got all the same equipment that the f***ing, that the people that made this
[27:47.220 --> 27:53.420]  Christmas album have. Physiologically, we're almost identical. I bet, I would gather. Yet
[27:53.420 --> 27:58.620]  when they say things, when they string words together in a melody, it sounds like music.
[27:58.620 --> 28:04.540]  And when I do it, it like, people cry. The great thing is though, the beautiful thing is,
[28:04.600 --> 28:08.100]  it doesn't stop me from singing. No, it doesn't. Well, I sing in defiance.
[28:10.180 --> 28:14.640]  But anyway, I just, I feel so bad. I felt, I was listening to next week's episode already,
[28:14.720 --> 28:17.720]  which luckily didn't have that thing at the end of it. Otherwise I would have been,
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.600]  uh, keen to your little bit, but I was listening to it. And, uh, and I was just thinking like,
[28:22.620 --> 28:26.300]  man, it sucks that it sucks that we just kind of blew through it. Cause I really,
[28:26.300 --> 28:30.560]  I really want to talk about it and, and, and thank them for it. Cause they did such a great job.
[28:30.700 --> 28:36.080]  Anyway, that's all. It was a great job. And I enjoyed Andrew and Eric's cameos.
[28:36.380 --> 28:41.260]  I enjoyed Eric's cameo. Eric's cameo was fantastic. Mine was terrible. I'm not going to pretend. It
[28:41.260 --> 28:45.740]  was a great, it's insane that they pulled that off. And it was so exciting to like get updates
[28:46.220 --> 28:50.500]  across. I don't know. It felt like a few months or at least a month of just things and like
[28:50.500 --> 28:54.580]  everything they did, whether it was the album art or the infomercial, it was just all so cool.

[30:43.410 --> 30:48.110]  Let's talk about HelloFresh for a second. With HelloFresh, you get fresh, pre-measured
[30:48.110 --> 30:52.930]  ingredients and mouth-watering seasonal recipes delivered right to your door. And guess what?
[30:52.990 --> 30:58.530]  It's a season right now, so they will have recipes that are appropriate for this season.
[30:59.110 --> 31:03.070]  They also let you skip those trips to the grocery store, and they make home cooking easy,
[31:03.210 --> 31:08.750]  fun, and affordable. And that's why it's America's number one meal kit. The savings in gas alone is
[31:08.750 --> 31:17.010]  tremendous, unless you live in the grocery store. I saw a condo downtown one time that had a secret
[31:17.010 --> 31:21.970]  door at the bottom that went into the little grocery store. I didn't end up living there,
[31:22.030 --> 31:26.230]  but that was a huge selling point. How cool, you just go downstairs on the elevator, and then
[31:26.230 --> 31:32.070]  you're right into a little grocery store where you can pick up some eggs and Diet Coke. Anyway,
[31:32.470 --> 31:36.750]  HelloFresh cuts out stressful meal planning and grocery store trips so you can enjoy cooking
[31:36.750 --> 31:41.690]  and get dinner on the table in like 30 minutes or less. That's always the most daunting thing is
[31:41.690 --> 31:44.750]  when you sit down and you start adding up doing the math and figuring out it's gonna take me like
[31:44.750 --> 31:50.350]  90 minutes to cook this. Not a problem with HelloFresh because they take your time into
[31:50.350 --> 31:56.530]  their consideration. They offer like more than 23 recipes a week featuring a range of flavors,
[31:56.810 --> 32:02.210]  cuisines, ingredients, so you never get bored. I know that in the before times when I before I would
[32:02.210 --> 32:07.430]  use HelloFresh, I would get caught cooking like the same three things over and over again until
[32:07.430 --> 32:13.510]  you're just bored to death. It's nice that HelloFresh has so many opportunities to stretch
[32:13.510 --> 32:19.830]  your palate as it were. Eating healthier has never been easier with low-cal, carb-smart, vegetarian,
[32:20.050 --> 32:25.290]  pescatarian options every week. And no matter what you choose, every single recipe is packaged with
[32:25.290 --> 32:29.890]  fresh produce sourced directly from farmers. They're the ones that make the food. They're
[32:29.890 --> 32:34.710]  the food makers. Farmers. That's what we consider America's food makers. Cut down on grocery bills
[32:34.710 --> 32:39.230]  and waste, HelloFresh delivers pre-portioned ingredients so you're not over buying which
[32:39.230 --> 32:42.490]  is a burden on the planet and your wallet and you're gonna end up throwing away a bunch of
[32:42.490 --> 32:48.130]  stuff anyway. I threw away so much celery today. I don't know why I was possessed. I like celery
[32:48.710 --> 32:53.550]  and it hurt to throw away all the extra celery. I don't know why I bought so much and how I forgot
[32:53.550 --> 32:57.910]  about it but I did and now it's in the trash. HelloFresh's Easy Eats offering has tons of quick
[32:57.910 --> 33:02.230]  and easy meal solutions like oven ready or 10 to 20 minute meals which are perfect for your busy
[33:02.230 --> 33:07.650]  schedule. I am assuming you have a busy schedule. I think everybody does at this point. So stop
[33:07.650 --> 33:12.110]  bragging about it. We get it. You're very busy. Just get the HelloFresh. So go to hellofresh.com

[33:31.210 --> 33:37.350]  not bad. Oh, and free shipping. That's even better. Andrew started messing with me this week,
[33:37.370 --> 33:41.990]  I feel like. Andrew was messing with you this week? What do you mean I turned? I think the
[33:41.990 --> 33:44.770]  bat thing isn't over. Why do you think I'm messing with you? The bat thing isn't over
[33:44.770 --> 33:50.850]  and I'm getting messed with. What does that mean? Well, I'm just going to read a text sent to me
[33:50.850 --> 33:57.630]  here by Geoff Ramsey to the group text. Geoff said, because with his cookies, he delivered my bat.
[33:58.190 --> 34:04.390]  Geoff said, how is the bat, Gav? Did you get it? What does that mean? I feel like that means,
[34:04.410 --> 34:09.190]  did you get the bat? Yeah, I brought the bat to your house. I handmade it for you.
[34:09.910 --> 34:15.010]  You're a member of Face. It's our first piece of like, cool, unique merchandise. I just wanted
[34:15.010 --> 34:19.930]  to know how you felt about it. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine and dandy. But I'd already thanked you
[34:19.930 --> 34:26.270]  for the bat in our own private text. And we'd already talked about it. So why would you then
[34:26.270 --> 34:31.630]  ask me again, in the group text how the bat was? Because I forgot that we had already talked about
[34:31.630 --> 34:36.110]  it in your personal text. Okay. All right. Also, I went back and looked at because you're right,
[34:36.110 --> 34:40.310]  we did. Because when I sent that text to the group chat, I thought, did I already ask this
[34:40.310 --> 34:46.410]  question? And I went back and you said, you just said, thanks for the cookies and Batman. And I
[34:46.410 --> 34:51.330]  said, no problem. And that was our conversation. Did you think I was talking about Batman? No,
[34:51.490 --> 34:59.470]  but I still didn't know what you thought about the bat. Also, you have no idea. So
[35:00.390 --> 35:06.010]  to go back a bit, spent all Sunday making these fucking stupid cookies, these Christmas cookies.
[35:06.550 --> 35:13.310]  There's so many people in Achievement Hunter and like Gus and Matt and everybody. And so I made
[35:13.310 --> 35:17.210]  like the Christmas list of people who I wanted to make. Not one, I wanted to make cookies for
[35:17.210 --> 35:22.010]  everybody on earth, but the people that I was going to deliver Christmas cookies to. And then
[35:22.750 --> 35:27.570]  I went and I got in my car and I just drove around to all of your houses. I know where all of you
[35:27.570 --> 35:31.310]  live now, by the way. And I dropped the cookies off and then I came home and Emily was like,
[35:31.350 --> 35:36.090]  what do people think of the cookies? And I was like, I don't know. I didn't think to ask them.
[35:36.350 --> 35:40.070]  And she goes, oh, nobody said thank you. And I go, well, I didn't talk to anybody.
[35:40.510 --> 35:44.110]  And she's like, well, nobody where people's nobody home. And I was like, I don't know. I
[35:44.110 --> 35:47.890]  just put them on people's front porches and got the fuck out of there because I don't want to
[35:47.890 --> 35:51.530]  talk to anybody, you know, in person. And I don't want to inconvenience them. And she was like,
[35:51.530 --> 35:56.310]  you don't just drop food off on people's front porch and then leave. And never did you text them
[35:56.310 --> 36:01.730]  and tell them it was there. And I didn't. And apparently that's really rude. So I didn't know
[36:01.730 --> 36:06.670]  that. But I dropped off like 20 packages of cookies to people around town. And I assume by now they've
[36:06.670 --> 36:11.990]  most of them have figured it out. But how is it rude? It says it says from Geoff on him. Yeah,
[36:12.030 --> 36:15.830]  I figured you'll go out to the mailbox at some point or you'll leave to go to the grocery store.
[36:15.930 --> 36:19.950]  At some point, you'll open your front door and there you'll see that there were cookies. Although
[36:19.950 --> 36:24.810]  I guess some people are out of town and I'm I haven't heard back from Berkeley. So that was
[36:24.810 --> 36:31.570]  four days ago. I would have done the exact same thing you did, Geoff. I just wanted to chime in
[36:31.570 --> 36:36.250]  and let you know that I support you a hundred percent. I would not have. I didn't know ringing
[36:36.250 --> 36:41.190]  a doorbell, no knocking on a door, no. You texted me the day before and you said, I'm doing this
[36:41.190 --> 36:45.890]  tomorrow. I need to look out for it. Boom. It was there. Done. I would have done the exact same
[36:45.890 --> 36:49.950]  thing. It wasn't. Thanks, man. Thanks, man. I appreciate that. From Geoff. I feel like you're
[36:49.950 --> 36:53.990]  completely in the clear. It was it certainly wasn't an attempt to be rude. I was thinking
[36:53.990 --> 36:58.750]  I was trying to be like, if anything, more gracious, because like, you know, what's the
[36:58.750 --> 37:01.990]  worst? Like what happens? What's the first thing you think of when your doorbell rings?
[37:02.790 --> 37:10.210]  I just wasn't rhetorical. I think I think, God damn it. Now I got to go to the door.
[37:10.670 --> 37:16.010]  What if it's a stranger? What if it's somebody that needs something? What if it's a crazy person?
[37:16.430 --> 37:21.050]  What if it's they want to give me literature? What if it's like my friend who's showing up
[37:21.050 --> 37:27.010]  because they need like, it's never good. The best case scenario is your Uber Eats order is on the
[37:27.010 --> 37:31.970]  ground, but then you're expecting that doorbell. So when it's an unexpected doorbell ring, it's 99%
[37:31.970 --> 37:35.950]  of the time going to be annoying. So way better just not to have it. It could be someone just
[37:36.550 --> 37:41.530]  saying, can you help me move? Yeah, exactly. That would be really bad. Or like my car broke down
[37:41.530 --> 37:46.450]  in your front yard. Can I have all like I need all of your tools and your phone and also I'm
[37:46.450 --> 37:50.990]  hungry. I don't know. You know, and so I didn't want to do that. I don't want to burden you guys.
[37:51.050 --> 37:54.330]  Some people have kids and stuff. Kids take naps. You don't want to fuck up their sleep schedule
[37:54.330 --> 38:00.710]  ringing doorbells. And then I got home and I felt bad because I realized I gave a bat. I hand
[38:00.710 --> 38:06.510]  delivered a bat to Eric, Nick, and Gavin. Gavin, yours was kind of funny. And then I realized we
[38:06.510 --> 38:11.690]  didn't get anything for Andrew. So we called the McDonald's in Andrew's town and tried to order
[38:11.690 --> 38:21.390]  40, was it 20 or 40? 20. Carrot muffins, whatever the fuck they're called, McMuffins or whatever.
[38:22.150 --> 38:26.890]  And then McDonald's was like, sir, we don't have that many. We only have six. So I asked
[38:26.890 --> 38:34.570]  them for an assortment of muffins. Let me tell you that story from my perspective. I randomly
[38:34.570 --> 38:39.410]  get a text. It was very nice text. It was great. It seemed very sweet. It's like we're going to
[38:39.410 --> 38:43.590]  send you something. I was like, that's incredibly kind. That's such a sweet gesture. Thank you.
[38:43.930 --> 38:51.410]  I gave my address and then I got a text saying expected in 10 to 15 minutes. And I was terrified.
[38:51.990 --> 38:56.670]  I had full bat paranoia because of everything leading up. I'm like, is this a bit? And are they
[38:56.670 --> 39:01.430]  going to fucking shoot a hornet's nest at my door? What do I need to be prepared for? It was stressful.
[39:01.870 --> 39:05.350]  I had no idea what to expect because of all the bat stuff. I didn't know if it was a bit. I was
[39:05.350 --> 39:09.790]  very thoughtful messages. It'd be strange if this was a bit, but this could totally be a bit.
[39:10.330 --> 39:14.490]  And then I got the McDonald's bag and I immediately knew it was either one of two things.
[39:14.590 --> 39:20.450]  It's either muffins or 50 burgers. And there was just dread and holding these giant bags
[39:20.450 --> 39:24.270]  because I couldn't tell what they were. They're just two massive heavy bags. It could have been
[39:24.270 --> 39:28.690]  either. And I was so relieved it was the muffins because I don't think I could do 50 burgers again.
[39:28.890 --> 39:33.770]  That would be the end of it. You didn't in the first place. It went from like, oh,
[39:33.770 --> 39:39.330]  this is such a sweet gesture to what the fuck is going on to, oh my God, are there burgers to,
[39:39.430 --> 39:43.570]  oh, this is fantastic. What a nice thing. Have you eaten all 20 muffins yet? Oh,
[39:43.590 --> 39:48.090]  no. I think I've had three muffins. My freezer is filled with muffins.
[39:49.770 --> 39:53.670]  It's almost all muffins. So you said my bat was funny. Why is it funny?
[39:54.130 --> 40:01.150]  Oh, your bat was funny because I delivered. I made like a map and I delivered in a line to everybody
[40:01.730 --> 40:06.630]  and I went from your house to Bernie's house to I don't know. Anyway, I went to eat from your house
[40:06.630 --> 40:10.570]  to a couple others. It was near the end because we live kind of close to each other and I dropped
[40:10.570 --> 40:15.470]  off your cookies and everything and then I drove over and as I was dropping Gus's thing off and
[40:15.470 --> 40:19.950]  thinking I was done, I looked down and I saw your stupid bat on my passenger seat and realized that
[40:19.950 --> 40:24.250]  I had dropped off everybody else's bat but yours. I forgot about you. So I had to drive all the way
[40:24.250 --> 40:28.530]  back across town to your house, drop off your bat in the same spot as your cookies, which I noticed
[40:28.530 --> 40:33.650]  you hadn't found yet, but I thought that if you were paying attention to your ring camera, you
[40:33.650 --> 40:39.030]  would see me show up twice that might appear suspicious. Well, I got them both. Got the bat.
[40:39.470 --> 40:43.450]  It's fine. What do you think? What do you think? You think it's worth... what are we selling them
[40:43.450 --> 40:51.850]  for? A thousand dollars? I had to text Andrew about the bat and then I believe that Andrew
[40:52.590 --> 40:58.290]  filled you in on some of my doubt about the bat. Gavin is very paranoid, but I get him.
[40:58.530 --> 41:02.690]  I am. Because I thought Geoff was setting a hornet's nest at my door, so I understand your paranoia.
[41:04.170 --> 41:08.090]  You asked me a very weird question. This is what Gavin asked me. I mean, you have the tax
[41:08.090 --> 41:13.850]  out. I'm assuming you could see it. He asked me how big are the bats and then he told me he had
[41:13.850 --> 41:19.030]  one in his possession. It was a strange question. I don't understand why you... I guess I wasn't paying
[41:19.030 --> 41:24.170]  attention when you were talking about the bats as to how big the bats were. I was imagining
[41:24.570 --> 41:32.150]  the size of a bat, but it's a tiny little bat, like barely like halfway up my shin in length.
[41:32.790 --> 41:37.190]  So I was like, did he deliberately get me a small bat? And then I looked at some pictures. I was
[41:37.190 --> 41:40.850]  like, I think they're all small, but I was... and then there was that picture of you holding one of
[41:40.850 --> 41:47.150]  the bats. And I was holding my hand out in the same way, trying to match the size to your photo.
[41:47.650 --> 41:52.070]  And then I just asked Andrew, I was like, how big are the bats that Geoff was engraving? Andrew
[41:52.070 --> 41:57.530]  said, I have no idea. What's your shoe size? Yeah. Uh, which then is a different discussion
[41:57.530 --> 42:01.970]  we ended up having. And then I was like, ah, I just thought they were full-size bats. Andrew's
[42:01.970 --> 42:05.910]  like, no, they were never full-size bats. Why do you ask? And then that conversation ended and
[42:05.910 --> 42:12.230]  Andrew asked me, how big is your bat? And I said, small. And then Geoff asked me, how's your bat?
[42:12.870 --> 42:17.310]  So what's it... am I just paranoid and you're just playing off it? Or did you,
[42:17.310 --> 42:22.610]  did you give me a gammy little tiny bat? I will say the... okay, so the shoe size thing,
[42:22.690 --> 42:26.630]  just to go back to that for a minute. I didn't think you had your bat yet, Gavin. You didn't
[42:26.630 --> 42:31.950]  tell me. I had no context for if you had it or not. So I thought you were asking me how big the
[42:31.950 --> 42:37.630]  bat was in the photo. And I assumed it would be about the length of your arm. But I was trying
[42:37.630 --> 42:41.090]  to think of like a visual indicator. Because isn't it like a thing where if you put your shoe
[42:41.090 --> 42:46.450]  on like your forearm, it's like the size of like from your elbow to your fingertip or something?
[42:46.450 --> 42:50.330]  Like isn't that matchup? No. I feel like that's a thing. No, I feel like it's definitely a thing.
[42:50.330 --> 42:53.410]  Wait, your elbow to your fingertip? I'm going to get my shoe. I'll be right back.
[42:53.630 --> 42:58.090]  There's no way. I feel like it definitely, I know it feels like there isn't, but...
[42:58.090 --> 43:02.770]  Maybe your shoulder to your elbow? I don't know. So is it a normal bat, Geoff?
[43:03.370 --> 43:10.770]  Let me go back to a conversation I had with Andrew. This is from Tuesday. Andrew, Andrew,
[43:11.270 --> 43:17.570]  Gavin thinks you gave him a fake bat. I said, interesting. Interesting. What makes him say that,
[43:17.790 --> 43:23.890]  Andrew? He thinks it's too small. I say, I would tend to agree. Because I've been
[43:23.890 --> 43:29.870]  bitching about how small they are. The damn knob is forever. He said, ha ha ha. Then a day later,
[43:30.290 --> 43:35.390]  he says, what did you tell Gavin that I told you? And I said, nothing. Why? And he said,
[43:36.010 --> 43:40.530]  interesting. And that's it. This is the conversation I had with Andrew. I don't know who's,
[43:40.530 --> 43:44.370]  I don't know who's fucking with who at this point. I thought at that point, it had flipped back
[43:44.370 --> 43:49.050]  around on me again. And I was getting like triple fucked. And so I just washed my hands of the
[43:49.050 --> 43:54.010]  whole thing. All I could hope for is that Gavin spent at least 10 minutes inside his house looking
[43:54.010 --> 43:57.650]  at a bat going, is this thing fucking good? Is this going to blow up in my face? Is it going to,
[43:57.670 --> 44:01.290]  is it going to smell like dog turds? Like what's the problem? Because that's what my life was like
[44:01.290 --> 44:05.090]  for like two weeks. So if I could get 10 minutes of that in Gavin's house, I'm fine.
[44:05.090 --> 44:11.710]  I'll take it. I'll take a fucking, it's gold to me. After I saw the message, Geoff, that you wrote
[44:11.710 --> 44:19.390]  in the group text, how's your bat? I just, you know, I was like, yeah, great. Later on that day,
[44:19.470 --> 44:25.570]  Andrew texts me, when Hitman 3 releases, we should have a contest, blah, blah, blah. I just said,
[44:25.750 --> 44:33.070]  I don't trust you. You've let my bat doubt slip to Geoff. He said, what? What did Geoff tell you
[44:33.070 --> 44:38.270]  that I told him? And I said, just what he asked in the group text. He said, I don't see how that's
[44:38.270 --> 44:43.470]  a betrayal. I said, you always betray your greatest allies. He said, what does that mean? I said,
[44:43.470 --> 44:49.370]  there's no innocence here. He said, if I think if anyone has betrayed anyone here, it's you.
[44:49.950 --> 44:55.270]  And then we ended up just arguing with each other. This is all from nothing. There's nothing,
[44:55.370 --> 44:59.810]  nothing has happened. This is okay. Well, this is what happened, Gavin. Cause I thought that
[44:59.810 --> 45:05.810]  group text, your group text thing was Geoff's group text of how are the bats? Cause I didn't
[45:05.810 --> 45:10.330]  know the context that he had asked you in another way that didn't register to me as weird at all.
[45:10.370 --> 45:16.270]  So when you said, I felt like Geoff must've sent you something directly. So then I went to Geoff
[45:16.270 --> 45:20.790]  to see what he'd say that he sent you. And then I was going to ask you the same. And I was going
[45:20.790 --> 45:26.030]  to like cross interview, both of you seeing what the other person said, but you had nothing. It
[45:26.030 --> 45:31.550]  was just a comment that Geoff made in a group text. There's nothing there. You're right. It's a
[45:31.550 --> 45:35.010]  whole bunch of paranoia over nothing. It's all because I didn't pay attention to how big the
[45:35.010 --> 45:39.490]  bats were. Yes. You, for some reason thought these were full size bats. We just need to sell these
[45:39.490 --> 45:45.450]  fucking bats. We just need it to be done with. We need to move on, sell the amazing bats. I think,
[45:45.630 --> 45:51.570]  I think they're coming out like January 8th. Is that right? Is that when this, when is this
[45:51.570 --> 45:57.230]  podcast? Is this, are we, this is the week after Christmas. Yeah. We're recording this December
[45:58.190 --> 46:04.770]  17th, I believe. That's what day it is. Yeah. Yeah. I think the, the bats, the, the, uh,
[46:04.830 --> 46:12.190]  Russian miss fuck the Russian fuck hat. And, uh, the Ian shirt all come out like on the same day
[46:12.190 --> 46:17.170]  in January. Right. I know. Right. Cause we were, we were talking about Andrew and I were talking
[46:17.170 --> 46:24.550]  about how fucking how face of it, of us. It is that we're releasing our biggest merch drop ever
[46:24.550 --> 46:29.690]  right after Christmas. After everybody's done spending money, not just right after Christmas,
[46:29.930 --> 46:35.870]  after Christmas pass, when there's ever a sale, there's no sale around. Well, yeah, it's like,
[46:35.910 --> 46:41.250]  like two weeks after everybody got their presents and then spent all the money that they got for
[46:41.250 --> 46:47.670]  Christmas. So everybody is dead ass broke. Like probably the brokest you'll be in the year is
[46:47.670 --> 46:52.490]  January 6th to the 9th or something. And, uh, and so that's when we're going to release our
[46:52.490 --> 47:00.590]  merchandise. So dude, speaking of the bats, uh, Jack super fan, Jack texts me, uh, an absolute
[47:00.590 --> 47:07.350]  revelation. He said, Katie pointed out that a bat knob is just a door handle, just a doorknob. Yeah.
[47:07.350 --> 47:11.030]  They're just door. So we could just sell like cabinet knobs,
[47:12.730 --> 47:17.150]  sign those. Has there, have we ever sold doorknobs? I think that's the first.
[47:17.330 --> 47:21.730]  I think it is a first. Do you sell a doorknob as a, as a bat knob?
[47:22.970 --> 47:26.410]  We can have the official face doorknob bat knob.
[47:26.670 --> 47:29.990]  No, we just call it doorknob too. Where it'd be like, how did you come to,
[47:30.130 --> 47:34.330]  how did you get to doorknob? And it's like, you don't want to know. It's a, it's a long road.
[47:35.470 --> 47:40.370]  I like the idea of tracing from the very beginning of the podcast. How do we get to selling a doorknob?
[47:43.050 --> 47:46.690]  Uh, well, we'll find out what the second poorest day of the year is,
[47:46.730 --> 47:50.950]  and then we'll release the doorknobs on that day. That'd be awesome. Yeah. That'd be great.
[47:51.570 --> 47:55.050]  Uh, I'm excited about the E actually I'm excited about the bats. I hope people like them.
[47:55.290 --> 47:59.970]  Uh, and I hope people buy them, uh, because of all the misery that went into each bat,
[48:00.090 --> 48:02.850]  but I'm excited about that Ian shirt too. Cause I just selfishly want to wear it.
[48:02.850 --> 48:06.290]  Yeah. I mean, I think every, all the merch for that is amazing. Finally, the hats
[48:06.290 --> 48:09.030]  are being sold. How long has that been in the works?
[48:09.470 --> 48:12.930]  Uh, like seven years. Can you guys hear the dog eating his squeaky toy?
[48:13.570 --> 48:18.450]  No. No, I can't. I heard something.
[48:21.210 --> 48:24.710]  In case you think that a clown is being beaten to death, uh, in the background.
[48:26.310 --> 48:30.970]  I'm glad that I've got a normal small bat. It's amazing what paranoid,
[48:30.970 --> 48:35.430]  what your own brain can do to you. It's the worst dude. We are our own worst enemies. I was
[48:35.430 --> 48:41.970]  miserable. I put the bats, I put the bats in the spare bedroom closet
[48:43.850 --> 48:50.310]  for like a full, probably 10 days before. Oh, can you hear it? Yes.
[48:52.890 --> 48:58.430]  For probably, probably a full 10 days before I took him back out again. I was just like,
[48:58.430 --> 49:05.210]  I got to get it away from me. I don't trust it. Speaking of normal bats, regular bats,
[49:05.430 --> 49:11.010]  I got my bats this week. I received my bat shipping. Your fluke face bat. My fluke face,
[49:11.050 --> 49:16.110]  my fluke face bats. I've got that on the, uh, on our text exchange as well.
[49:16.570 --> 49:20.270]  Yeah. Do you want to go through that? Well, you posted a picture, uh, on it.
[49:20.270 --> 49:26.430]  It says, uh, fluke face at the end, the fluke, the, uh, the classic fluke face logo,
[49:26.430 --> 49:32.370]  and that says fluke face further down the bat as well. And under it, you wrote a fluke face bat
[49:32.370 --> 49:41.110]  in the text. Geoff said, it's huge under that under the fluke face on the bat. It says all is one
[49:41.110 --> 49:56.270]  word. Not the, uh, store, not the store is what it looks like. So I just wrote nothing else. I
[49:56.270 --> 50:05.770]  wrote, well, that's unfortunate. I didn't notice. I was so happy with the bats. It was like a flex.
[50:05.850 --> 50:12.190]  It was my bat flex. And there's this huge error. You get the first face. I don't know this print.
[50:12.790 --> 50:18.810]  I'll just post it in here. This is my great fluke face. Not the R store. Not the store.
[50:20.890 --> 50:26.010]  I cannot believe it. I know I could. I mean, it's so me. I assumed
[50:26.010 --> 50:30.470]  I made the error though. But then I looked at my order and I sent it correctly.
[50:30.950 --> 50:36.590]  They, it was a company error on their side. They fucked it up. That was not twice as much now.
[50:36.850 --> 50:42.490]  Not me. That's a very rare, rare bat. Geoff, I'm putting a light in your face right fucking now.
[50:42.690 --> 50:49.350]  I'm looking at you right in the eyes. This is suspicious. I emailed the company about the bats
[50:49.830 --> 50:55.550]  explaining my issue. This is what I got back as a reply. Who the fuck is Goffrey?
[50:55.550 --> 51:01.130]  That's not a real name. That is clearly you as an alias. I think you're on the inside. I think
[51:01.130 --> 51:06.090]  you're so deep in the bat game. You got a whole side bat business that I accidentally stumbled
[51:06.090 --> 51:13.610]  onto. And you're fucking me from the inside. So you're fucking me. You think that I would
[51:13.610 --> 51:20.450]  have an alter ego that's just a misspelling of my name? Yes. Yes, I do. You think that Geoff
[51:20.450 --> 51:26.170]  went out there, got ahead of this, started a bat company in hope that you would use it?
[51:26.510 --> 51:31.290]  Yes. No, no, no. No, not that I would use it. I think Geoff found out that he's got a deep love
[51:31.290 --> 51:38.370]  of bats, joined a bat company under his alias, and then I happened to use that same service
[51:38.370 --> 51:44.530]  and Geoff is sabotaging me from the inside because he wants to own the bat market. That is not a real
[51:44.530 --> 51:53.650]  name. A couple things. One, Gavin's idea makes way more sense to me that I would do it to fuck
[51:53.650 --> 51:59.170]  with you, not that I would have some sort of love of bats. And two, that is a brutal, brutal
[51:59.770 --> 52:06.570]  bastardization of my name. I have in 45 years never seen it misspelled quite like that. That's
[52:06.570 --> 52:13.330]  offensive. I understand it's probably how that poor man's or I'm not sure how that person identifies,
[52:13.330 --> 52:19.030]  but that poor person's literal, like it might be the name on their birth certificate, so it
[52:19.030 --> 52:24.310]  sucks for them, but I would never in a million years assume that identity. I hate, I would be
[52:24.310 --> 52:30.270]  like, I'd be like, I'd be like... Your explanation right now makes me think it's just you. I'd be,
[52:30.430 --> 52:34.910]  what do you mean? I was gonna say I'd be Dirk, but that's taken. I'd pick a really cool name,
[52:35.510 --> 52:42.090]  like Dirk. Why is it, Andrew, that if you ever try and get anything made, there's a huge
[52:42.090 --> 52:48.310]  manufacturing issue? That's what I said. That's what, in the first episode of this show,
[52:48.610 --> 52:53.030]  Geoff is like, you bring it on yourself. I don't bring this on myself. This wasn't my fault.
[52:53.390 --> 53:00.070]  I exude f*** face. This is just my life. I did everything right, and that's what I get.
[53:00.350 --> 53:05.330]  There is nothing else I could have done. It just happens. I would argue that the right thing would
[53:05.330 --> 53:15.410]  be not to get the bat made. No! The thing here is that Andrew's paranoia comes from projection
[53:15.410 --> 53:23.870]  to a degree that is like insane. He's like, Geoff, clearly this is you. You set up an alter ego.
[53:24.150 --> 53:30.670]  You're so deep in the bat game. And the only reason he thinks that is because he set up four
[53:30.670 --> 53:36.510]  or five dummy accounts so he could record an episode because he felt like doing it at a
[53:36.510 --> 53:45.170]  different time. I mean, like, no one thinks at the level that Andrew is thinking, but he's putting
[53:45.170 --> 53:50.870]  that on everyone else. Yeah, no one could even possibly dream of being one step ahead of where
[53:50.870 --> 53:56.330]  Andrew might go. There's absolutely no indication at any point that like what happened today.
[53:56.330 --> 54:01.190]  I was going about my business, having a day. My phone pops up a discord notification
[54:01.810 --> 54:10.430]  saying Gavin Free has joined the discord. I was like, what? Later on, I go. This is like
[54:10.430 --> 54:16.650]  half an hour before the podcast starts. I look at our recording room that we record in.
[54:17.430 --> 54:26.790]  Wait. Fascinating. Fascinating. Geoff just admitted that he. Sorry, go ahead. Sorry.
[54:28.070 --> 54:32.150]  So I look at the room. You can see the list of names who are in the room that you recorded.
[54:32.510 --> 54:39.010]  I look in the room. I see Andrew, Geoff, Eric, Nick and myself. Actually, I don't think Nick
[54:39.010 --> 54:45.870]  was in there yet. So I joined and Andrew was talking, but his voice was coming out of all
[54:45.870 --> 54:52.270]  four accounts at the same time. It sounded like a face nightmare. And then Nick came in and I hope
[54:52.270 --> 54:57.370]  recorded some and then you guys came in. But how could we predict that was going to happen, Andrew?
[54:57.730 --> 55:01.570]  I don't I don't know what the point you're trying to make. How is it my job for you to
[55:01.570 --> 55:05.710]  predict what I'm going to do? Oh, you're saying because of Geoff, because I'm saying that Geoff.
[55:05.990 --> 55:09.630]  No. And once again, I'm not saying that Geoff planned this. Yeah, I'm not saying Geoff planned
[55:09.630 --> 55:14.890]  this. My whole thing is that Geoff really is into bats. Geoff crazily saying I'm not that much of a
[55:14.890 --> 55:19.270]  bat guy. All he's talked about for eight weeks in a row. You're the biggest bat guy I know.
[55:19.470 --> 55:23.950]  You definitely would get into the bat business. And I think you would just be lazy with your
[55:23.950 --> 55:28.970]  alternate alias. I've never seen that name anywhere before. And my bats got suddenly
[55:28.970 --> 55:35.350]  fucked. It's very mysterious. Here's the deal, Andrew. That's a that's a ludicrous, ludicrous
[55:35.350 --> 55:41.950]  assertion. I'm not going to tell you it's not true, though. It's probably not true. It's probably
[55:42.630 --> 55:49.190]  very, very most likely not true. But it could be. You're 99 percent sure that it's not true.
[55:49.530 --> 55:54.010]  Could be. It's definitely not true. And you're 99 percent sure. I know it's true, though. Like,
[55:54.030 --> 55:57.250]  you're trying to do like a mind game with me where you're trying to make me think it's not true.
[55:57.550 --> 56:01.410]  It is true. I'm just going to believe that it is true. It could be. It absolutely could be true.
[56:01.530 --> 56:06.110]  I could. It could be true. I could have done those things in that way that you described.
[56:06.410 --> 56:11.690]  Absolutely. Yeah. I think the only way to end all this paranoia is absolutely no contact during
[56:11.690 --> 56:15.570]  the week. What does that mean? Well, like the paranoia just came from talking to you,
[56:15.670 --> 56:20.030]  just talking to the both of you, for me at least this week. And I feel like it's dangerous
[56:20.030 --> 56:25.010]  and we shouldn't do it. I feel like the source is the bats, right? I mean, technically, if we want
[56:25.010 --> 56:30.450]  to get really serious about this, Gavin, and follow the thread to the beginning, this is your
[56:30.450 --> 56:36.250]  fault. This is all your fault. This is our fault. So for you to then be the solution is talk to
[56:36.250 --> 56:44.010]  nobody. Fascinating. It is my fault. Yeah, you were the first. You pushed the first domino over
[56:44.010 --> 56:50.330]  and they're still falling. I got to say, though, misery definitely loves company and it makes me
[56:50.330 --> 56:58.350]  so happy inside that you two are both paranoid because I'm just happy that I'm not the only
[56:58.350 --> 57:05.610]  one that got out of this bat scenario scathed. No, no, we're all broken. I like that I feel
[57:05.610 --> 57:11.050]  vulnerable enough around you guys to come clean, though, and just ask about it straight up
[57:11.050 --> 57:16.750]  instead of holding on to the paranoia and keeping it inside me. I at least was able to talk to you
[57:16.750 --> 57:22.150]  both about it, so that's nice. Yeah. Yeah, I assume that's a dig at Andrew. And a good way
[57:22.150 --> 57:27.770]  to end the episode, probably, as Eric points out, we have to accommodate the cool intro. Are we
[57:27.770 --> 57:33.490]  putting in any of the f*** face demon that Andrew made? I don't know. It was bad. I don't know if
[57:33.490 --> 57:38.250]  anyone wants to listen to that. I think Nick had an idea, a.k.a. me. I had an idea, a.k.a. Nick.
[57:40.910 --> 57:45.990]  He'll talk to you about it. It's a good idea on paper. It's a good idea I didn't but did come up
[57:45.990 --> 57:50.470]  with. But I didn't. But I'm Nick. But I'm not Nick. I'm all of you. Andrew is talking out of
[57:50.470 --> 57:57.310]  our mouths and typing as us as this episode. Should I should I end the podcast as all of you?
[57:57.570 --> 58:02.410]  Which Nick is talking right now in the chat? Is that real Nick? I have no idea.
[58:02.410 --> 58:09.090]  That's a great question. Real Nick. But I could just write real Nick. How do you know? Like,
[58:09.230 --> 58:14.650]  Geoff, write something in the chat or Gavin. Somebody right now, Eric. Eric or Geoff,
[58:14.990 --> 58:19.970]  write something in the chat. Chat. Who's talking? Me. I don't understand. Can we just wrap the
[58:19.970 --> 58:23.890]  episode? I'm in hell. This is hell. What's going on? You want to wrap the episode? This has got to
[58:23.890 --> 58:30.650]  be our the oddest episode we've had. Yeah, definitely up there is most bizarre, like,
[58:30.650 --> 58:34.450]  front to back. So do we keep topping that? It doesn't make any sense. All right. So,
[58:34.610 --> 58:38.150]  Andrew, you're going to unmute everyone and do it. Yeah, let me let me let me do the group
[58:38.150 --> 58:45.490]  outro. Oh, God. Now there's two voices. We got three. What am I supposed to say again?
[58:47.690 --> 58:51.270]  Thank everyone for listening. Yeah. Could you just write it?
[58:51.270 --> 58:58.170]  Are you read it? I brought Nick in here. So this is I'm going to bring it down.
[58:59.610 --> 59:06.810]  I'm going to. OK, so everybody, this is a visual joke for an audio podcast. I don't know why we
[59:06.810 --> 59:11.890]  did this. This is why it came into, by the way. This is why I arrived into. Yeah, me too. It's
[59:11.890 --> 59:17.230]  a it was a mindfuck for sure. You know what? That attitude? I'm just not going to say anything.
[59:17.230 --> 59:23.330]  I came in. I came into this followed up immediately by you guys throwing balls to each other.
[59:24.210 --> 59:28.830]  It was it was not a welcoming way to enter into the podcast.
[59:28.930 --> 59:33.650]  Wait, take it away. So he's not. Oh, right. So he's done. He's done. He's taken away. Andrew,
[59:33.790 --> 59:40.550]  Geoff, Eric, Kevin, go. Thanks for listening to the Face podcast. If you made it all the way to here,
[59:40.570 --> 59:46.010]  you're made of Stern stuff. Speaking of Stern, Howard Stern just signed up for another five
[59:46.010 --> 59:49.470]  years. I know he's I was going to call him a competitor. And I thought, that's not right.
[59:49.490 --> 59:52.950]  I'll call him a peer. But that's also not right. We are not on the same level. But congratulations
[59:52.950 --> 59:58.030]  to that. He'll be one hundred and four by the time he finishes that contract and five stars like and
[59:58.030 --> 01:00:03.490]  subscribe. I have it on good authority that people are really liking this podcast. And apparently
[01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:09.710]  it's it's doing very, very well in the in the charts. So keep up the good work. And I'm sorry
[01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.370]  about Andrew. Thanks for listening.
