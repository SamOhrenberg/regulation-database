[00:00.000 --> 00:04.460]  You don't technically need this car. You say that out loud to yourself.
[00:04.880 --> 00:08.640]  You say, I have no space. You say, eh, I'm just looking.
[00:09.060 --> 00:13.940]  Then you click. Then you zoom in on photo number 87 and whisper, oh no.
[00:14.360 --> 00:16.900]  Then you text a friend, the one who always enables you.
[00:17.240 --> 00:21.960]  You say to yourself, this is the last one, knowing it is not.
[00:22.460 --> 00:27.580]  You don't need this car. But maybe, just maybe, this car needs you.
[00:27.580 --> 00:30.060]  Bring a trailer. It's never just a car.
[00:30.620 --> 00:33.740]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:45.650 --> 00:53.450]  Hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face, a podcast about three dipshits doing dipshit stuff.
[00:53.530 --> 01:00.390]  My name is Geoff. With me, as always, are Gavin and my very, very, very, very, very, very, very good friend, Andrew.
[01:00.830 --> 01:04.610]  What an overcompensation that was. Hello. Hello.
[01:05.390 --> 01:09.130]  Is it 2021 now? God, I hope so.
[01:09.210 --> 01:14.230]  We ended 2020 on F*** Face with a weird left turn.
[01:14.830 --> 01:18.850]  I think it's a great episode. I disagree with this. It'll be interesting to see the response.
[01:19.250 --> 01:23.570]  You haven't heard the first 15 minutes of it. I think they're a quality 15 minutes.
[01:24.250 --> 01:28.470]  It's a great episode. Let's promise not to outdo that episode with this episode.
[01:28.790 --> 01:33.190]  Okay. Should I just open with... There's something I meant to mention last episode.
[01:33.190 --> 01:35.470]  We didn't get around to it. I think this is pretty exciting.
[01:35.770 --> 01:39.510]  We didn't get around to anything. No, yeah, we didn't.
[01:40.010 --> 01:45.990]  We didn't really talk about anything. But the one thing I did want to talk about, we did not address at all.
[01:46.150 --> 01:49.230]  I don't think Geoff even knows about this. I'd be surprised if he does.
[01:50.110 --> 01:56.210]  Okay. Did you know, Geoff, that Thank Us Later, real thing now.
[01:56.690 --> 01:59.610]  I made a website for Thank Us Later. It's a totally real site.
[02:00.250 --> 02:03.890]  We're kicking... I'm gauging interest. I meant to ask you.
[02:04.290 --> 02:07.830]  Yeah. Last episode, did you run an ad on the RT podcast?
[02:08.290 --> 02:14.350]  That's the thing. I ran an ad on the RT podcast for Thank Us Later, just to gauge interest.
[02:14.670 --> 02:18.050]  We have a new... We have superfan Gus now, as well as superfan Jack.
[02:18.370 --> 02:22.510]  Gus was kind enough to do it. Ran an ad for Thank Us Later.
[02:22.750 --> 02:27.150]  I've been getting... I've gotten like 70 emails from people, mainly confused.
[02:27.750 --> 02:29.650]  A lot of people don't know how to react.
[02:29.990 --> 02:36.350]  Some people somehow think that somebody stole the business idea and launched it within the week and got an ad for it.
[02:36.610 --> 02:39.030]  I've gotten a lot of those, too, which would be incredible.
[02:39.390 --> 02:45.270]  Although, if there's one business you could immediately steal and run with, it's one where they don't do anything for the first four months.
[02:45.350 --> 02:46.950]  You literally would only need one thing.
[02:47.770 --> 02:53.450]  So, is this the same superfan Gus that you told us before the episode started,
[02:53.530 --> 02:56.830]  because you didn't want to talk about it in the episode, that you were starting a war with him?
[02:56.830 --> 03:01.150]  No, I'm not starting a war with Gus at all. I completely disagree with that.
[03:01.250 --> 03:05.590]  I was just... You know what happened was, I was listening to the podcast.
[03:05.870 --> 03:09.070]  I wanted to hear the ad. Gus did a great job. Such a nice guy.
[03:09.650 --> 03:13.430]  Gus has a podcast of his own, as well, called Black Box Down.
[03:13.530 --> 03:18.350]  I don't know if you've looked into Black Box Down. Geoff or Gavin? Fantastic show. Great podcast.
[03:19.190 --> 03:21.370]  Have you been to their website? Just curious.
[03:21.530 --> 03:24.030]  They have a... They have a Black Box Down website?
[03:24.030 --> 03:30.050]  Yeah, they have their own website, and, you know, it's really nice, because, like, superfan Gus is great. Really great guy.
[03:30.390 --> 03:34.930]  Went on their website, and I was so touched. It was such a nice gift to us.
[03:34.990 --> 03:36.550]  I didn't realize they were such big fans.
[03:37.470 --> 03:41.710]  Black Box Down is just kind of a fan site for f***face, which I didn't anticipate.
[03:42.030 --> 03:46.250]  I just put a link in the thing. Black Box Down. Very official site.
[03:48.090 --> 03:49.330]  Black Box Down.
[03:50.210 --> 03:51.810]  It's Black Box Down. It's their podcast.
[03:52.790 --> 03:54.550]  Oh, you had Eric post it.
[03:57.890 --> 04:00.690]  Oh, I did. Eric did post it. Whoops, I forgot what happened.
[04:07.370 --> 04:09.630]  You're getting tangled in your web of lies, Ed.
[04:10.150 --> 04:16.610]  No, I'm not. I just made the fall guy. This has nothing to do with me. I saw this. It's Eric's fault. Eric did this.
[04:18.310 --> 04:19.110]  BlackBoxDown.com
[04:19.110 --> 04:21.610]  BlackBoxDown. Yeah, I was shocked.
[04:21.610 --> 04:23.590]  The number one f***face fan blog.
[04:24.630 --> 04:29.770]  Yeah, superfan Gus. I didn't expect it, but it was really nice.
[04:30.110 --> 04:32.630]  Did you draw that on some notepaper?
[04:33.150 --> 04:39.130]  No, I didn't do any of the drawings. These are wonderful drawings from maybe the community. Maybe I don't know who made them.
[04:39.170 --> 04:42.050]  Maybe the community did. I don't know. I didn't make the site. Gus did.
[04:42.190 --> 04:47.090]  Superfan Gus and the podcast. I think it was very touching, so I wanted to share it.
[04:47.090 --> 04:49.170]  I didn't expect it. I just stumbled onto this.
[04:49.470 --> 04:52.790]  It's a cute drawing. We should make a t-shirt out of it.
[04:52.870 --> 04:57.430]  There's a picture of the f***face logo. There's a picture of the disgusting waffle.
[04:57.830 --> 05:01.730]  Oh, I see what you've done, you son of a bitch.
[05:02.530 --> 05:03.830]  What do you mean, what I've done?
[05:04.970 --> 05:06.550]  I'm sorry, who made this site again?
[05:06.630 --> 05:07.230]  Superfan Gus.
[05:07.870 --> 05:09.990]  Superfan Gus made this site. Okay.
[05:10.750 --> 05:13.850]  What's the one next to the waffle? It looks like someone's gut in a wetsuit.
[05:15.550 --> 05:16.350]  What is that?
[05:16.610 --> 05:18.550]  That's the f***hat.
[05:18.930 --> 05:21.550]  Did you not recognize the f***hat?
[05:21.930 --> 05:22.170]  No.
[05:23.130 --> 05:25.130]  Why did you say it like a gut in a wetsuit?
[05:25.290 --> 05:29.790]  Yeah, you know the iconic f***face moment. The gut in the wetsuit.
[05:29.990 --> 05:31.210]  I thought it was someone's front.
[05:32.110 --> 05:33.730]  The old gut in the wetsuit.
[05:35.290 --> 05:40.110]  Can we sell f***face wetsuit guts? Just the front of a wetsuit car.
[05:41.330 --> 05:42.910]  To go with the doorknobs.
[05:43.390 --> 05:50.010]  Can you have the front of the wetsuit without the back? Don't you need a back of a wetsuit to have the front? Isn't it just part of a wetsuit at that point?
[05:50.670 --> 05:55.150]  Wait, you don't know that you buy wetsuits in halves? You think they come as one whole wetsuit?
[05:55.270 --> 06:01.610]  No, they come as one whole wetsuit. Don't try to f*** with me. I know about wetsuits. You get a wetsuit. You're not going to trick me on wetsuits, Gavin.
[06:01.910 --> 06:03.150]  I was trying to get you like this.
[06:04.870 --> 06:06.190]  Andrew knows wetsuits.
[06:06.370 --> 06:08.170]  I f***ing know wetsuits.
[06:08.170 --> 06:09.730]  Why do you know wetsuits so much?
[06:09.730 --> 06:15.750]  I had a wetsuit when I was growing up. I know how a wetsuit works. I've worn a wetsuit, Gavin.
[06:15.870 --> 06:23.210]  Well, I'm not saying the whole front of a wetsuit. I'm saying we cut the stomach off and just make like a... it'd be like a mouse mat almost.
[06:23.870 --> 06:24.510]  Sure, yeah.
[06:25.070 --> 06:25.330]  Wetsuit guts.
[06:25.330 --> 06:31.790]  That's a good idea. I was just saying, can you have a front without a back? Can you just sell a front of a wetsuit? It's just part of a wetsuit at that point.
[06:32.030 --> 06:34.410]  There's nothing identifiable about a front of a wetsuit.
[06:34.770 --> 06:36.610]  I think we could. Yeah.
[06:36.610 --> 06:39.750]  I just think labeling it as the front of a wetsuit is weird.
[06:39.930 --> 06:45.270]  Well, it's just like, think of it this way. Like, you want to go swimming, you want to go surfing, you want to go boogie boarding.
[06:45.770 --> 06:51.510]  And you're pretty resistant to the cold, but for whatever reason, your abs get cold.
[06:52.090 --> 06:56.410]  You've got chilly abs, and you just want to cover that part.
[06:56.810 --> 06:57.870]  You've got a sensitive tummy.
[06:58.670 --> 07:02.610]  So we'll sell the front of the wetsuit, and we'll make like a strap.
[07:04.870 --> 07:05.730]  That's a good idea.
[07:06.510 --> 07:07.810]  I'm now on board for this.
[07:07.910 --> 07:11.610]  Could it have like a buckle system, like those really shitty cheap buckles?
[07:11.770 --> 07:14.370]  Could that be the... great. I love this.
[07:14.370 --> 07:16.190]  It could be whatever you want it to be. You're helping design it.
[07:16.450 --> 07:17.990]  There's actually two pieces of art, too.
[07:18.050 --> 07:20.890]  If you go to the About section, another great black box down.
[07:21.190 --> 07:25.250]  Whatever artist, or maybe Gus did, I don't know. Whoever did this. Phenomenal job.
[07:25.770 --> 07:33.030]  You know, I've got to say, because the latest one to come out at the point of this recording is the one where you talked about teenagers,
[07:33.030 --> 07:38.410]  I did see a few people thinking that 18 and 19, they weren't a teenager.
[07:38.950 --> 07:39.650]  It is, though.
[07:39.810 --> 07:45.930]  I would say the majority of comments I saw were people that were both on my side for that, and the sewing machine.
[07:46.270 --> 07:49.130]  I would say that I had the majority opinion for that episode.
[07:49.150 --> 07:52.530]  Wait, you think the majority of comments didn't know what a teenager was?
[07:52.850 --> 07:58.570]  No, no, no, no, no. I think a majority of comments were on my side that it's not as crazy to not know what that is.
[07:58.650 --> 07:59.550]  That it is a weird thing.
[08:00.310 --> 08:06.090]  I disagree. I don't think the majority at all was 40.
[08:06.090 --> 08:09.170]  At all? I would say at best it was 50-50.
[08:09.990 --> 08:15.690]  No, I would say 70-30. There were a surprising number of people that acknowledged that they had never thought about it either.
[08:16.230 --> 08:21.230]  Which, it just blows my mind. But it certainly wasn't the majority.
[08:21.890 --> 08:25.890]  Oh, I think there was a lot of people that were like, Geoff and Gavin, this is the first time.
[08:25.990 --> 08:29.250]  A lot of people saying, I hate to do this, but Andrew was right.
[08:29.250 --> 08:30.570]  I did see a few of those.
[08:31.770 --> 08:37.390]  Yeah, it was a nice even mix of, wow, hate to say it, but Andrew was making a lot of sense in this one.
[08:37.690 --> 08:41.150]  Combined with, I don't know what's wrong with Andrew. He needs help.
[08:41.750 --> 08:47.990]  I also saw a few, not very many, but a few that were like, you guys were a little mean to Andrew over the icky shuffle thing.
[08:48.090 --> 08:51.410]  Which I think is ludicrous to say. I don't think we were too mean at all.
[08:52.670 --> 08:54.610]  Oh, it was mainly Eric. Eric was just wrong.
[08:55.930 --> 09:00.630]  What's everyone saying about Sonic Burger? They're calling you the Sonic Burger guy.
[09:00.850 --> 09:03.070]  Oh yeah, you're some sort of a hypocrite.
[09:03.230 --> 09:14.290]  I thought that the name of the restaurant was Sonic Burger, and only found out recently during a Face Jam episode that it is not called Sonic Burger, it is just called Sonic.
[09:14.750 --> 09:16.350]  Oh, so you were called out on that podcast?
[09:16.490 --> 09:16.770]  Yes.
[09:16.810 --> 09:17.730]  Or in the comments?
[09:18.070 --> 09:18.970]  Oh, both.
[09:20.590 --> 09:24.950]  Can I just say, Eric, because you're at a much more mature podcast than Face Jam.
[09:26.410 --> 09:32.710]  Perfectly understandable mistake, and these things happen. I think we can all agree that that's totally understandable.
[09:32.890 --> 09:41.350]  I think to me it's just confusing the hedgehog with the hamburger, and I think that's an easy mistake to make because I feel like most people who play the hedgehog game also eat the hamburger place.
[09:41.750 --> 09:43.930]  So, it makes sense. I will say...
[09:43.930 --> 09:45.310]  Sonic the Burger.
[09:45.310 --> 10:02.670]  Yes. I will say, in my defense against the icky shuffle thing, and really I feel like the comments that people left for Andrew saying I'm right, I think that crazy people leave comments.
[10:02.990 --> 10:12.150]  When was the last time you left a comment on something that you consumed as a fan? That's all I'm saying, just something to put out there, something to think about.
[10:12.890 --> 10:20.390]  You know, you gotta take it for what it is, and really the people who are saying I agree with Andrew, I mean, really, that's...
[10:20.390 --> 10:24.030]  That's like saying, why do you read comments? They're all left by comment leavers.
[10:25.050 --> 10:27.190]  Right. Right. No, you're right. That's it.
[10:28.690 --> 10:33.530]  I think the people that leave comments are fantastic. Eric, get yourself back off mute. You're not done.
[10:34.310 --> 10:44.470]  We had an exchange yesterday. We went back and forth. Eric just making shit up about the sewing machine, and that I made it. I didn't come up with it, it's just what I was told it was.
[10:44.730 --> 10:58.310]  And I was open to being incorrect. We went back and forth. I called him out about the Sonic Burger thing. Eric then replied, maybe I will because I would not do that with Sonic the Hedgehog, the thing that would be easily confused for the hamburger sandwich shop.
[10:58.310 --> 11:08.550]  I replied, what the fuck is a hamburger sandwich shop? Eric said he'd get back to me on that, that he could find one. Haven't heard anything about it. Where's your hamburger sandwich shop?
[11:08.850 --> 11:14.870]  It's tough to find. When you Google hamburger sandwich shop, it's a lot of pictures of hamburgers and not much else.
[11:15.450 --> 11:18.410]  There's no such thing as a hamburger sandwich shop.
[11:18.410 --> 11:31.570]  Here's what I think. I think there are a lot of hamburger sandwich shops, but they all don't have websites and aren't on Google Maps because they're all run by old men who just go with the internet. That fad.
[11:32.370 --> 11:34.270]  I feel like I'm right about that.
[11:36.010 --> 11:40.550]  What even would be a hamburger sandwich shop? I don't even understand what that business is.
[11:40.550 --> 11:43.630]  A shop that sells hamburger sandwiches. I think it's pretty clear. It's pretty self-explanatory.
[11:43.630 --> 11:50.630]  But why would they only do that? Like an ice cream shop, I get it's only ice cream, but nobody's just selling hamburgers.
[11:52.090 --> 11:55.730]  Well, why would you think that that denotes that they only sell hamburgers?
[11:55.730 --> 11:57.810]  Because, Geoff, because he's a crazy person.
[11:57.890 --> 12:01.150]  No, because if you're... no, no, no, no, no. Shut up for a second.
[12:01.410 --> 12:09.530]  If you're making it anything else, you just call it a fucking restaurant or a drive-in or a diner. There are names for what these businesses are.
[12:09.530 --> 12:17.630]  If you're going as far to specifically call yourself the hamburger sandwich shop, that's because you only sell hamburger sandwiches.
[12:17.710 --> 12:18.830]  There'd be no other reason.
[12:18.930 --> 12:20.230]  Hey, Geoff. Have you ever been to Dan's?
[12:20.950 --> 12:21.770]  Dan's Hamburgers?
[12:21.830 --> 12:28.270]  Oh, are you talking about Dan's Hamburgers? Well, that must be the only one. There certainly wasn't a spin-off restaurant from Dan's Hamburgers, was there?
[12:28.810 --> 12:30.390]  You mean the one called Fran's Hamburgers?
[12:30.390 --> 12:36.330]  Oh, Fran's Hamburgers. That's interesting. Now, Geoff, when you ate at Dan's Hamburgers and Fran's Hamburgers and you went, I'm sure you got a hamburger.
[12:36.330 --> 12:39.050]  Were there other things at the hamburger sandwich shop?
[12:39.390 --> 12:43.730]  Sometimes I'll get a shake or some french fries.
[12:44.030 --> 12:44.630]  Interesting.
[12:44.950 --> 12:49.170]  Over at Hat Creek Hamburgers, I'll often get tater tots.
[12:49.330 --> 12:55.450]  I'm not saying hamburger places don't exist. I'm saying none of them identify as a hamburger sandwich shop.
[12:56.090 --> 13:04.910]  Go to fucking Dan's or Fran's and say, are you a hamburger sandwich shop? And just watch the soul leave their eyes. Nobody will know what you're talking about.
[13:04.910 --> 13:06.330]  None of them will say yes.
[13:06.870 --> 13:12.230]  Yeah, they got divorced. I think Fran's is actually gone now, but Dan's is still around.
[13:12.350 --> 13:14.950]  Yeah, I think there's two Dan's now, so there's no more Fran's.
[13:15.310 --> 13:19.210]  Nick also pointed out that there's the Texas Hamburger Company. That's weird.
[13:21.150 --> 13:28.730]  Well, I don't entirely understand what the argument is. Like, if you go to Cheesecake Factory...
[13:29.590 --> 13:30.630]  But that's a restaurant.
[13:30.650 --> 13:33.350]  That's a perfect example, Gavin. Thank you.
[13:33.350 --> 13:42.070]  They don't identify themselves as a fucking factory. If you go into Cheesecake Factory and say, are you factory workers? None of them will say yes. It's a restaurant.
[13:43.410 --> 13:43.930]  What?
[13:44.710 --> 13:51.130]  It's a restaurant. It's not a factory. They don't identify themselves as a factory. The restaurant is called the Cheesecake Factory.
[13:51.470 --> 13:52.870]  Another day at the factory.
[13:54.930 --> 13:59.170]  That's my point. Nobody would identify that as the factory.
[14:00.470 --> 14:02.990]  Oh, which one? The Cheesecake Factory.
[14:07.470 --> 14:12.790]  I mean, it's what you brought up with. It's a perfect point for me to make my point. None of them are factory workers.
[14:12.990 --> 14:15.830]  Is a restaurant not like a food factory by default?
[14:16.430 --> 14:17.470]  What does that even mean?
[14:17.650 --> 14:18.850]  What's the definition of a factory anyway?
[14:19.770 --> 14:24.070]  I don't know, but it's certainly not the Cheesecake Factory. It does not fall under those definitions.
[14:24.490 --> 14:27.590]  I mean, if you had like a robot making a cheesecake, would that make it a factory?
[14:27.590 --> 14:29.650]  I don't think so.
[14:29.990 --> 14:37.930]  Factory. Noun. A building or group of buildings where goods are manufactured or assembled chiefly by machine.
[14:38.150 --> 14:42.930]  Yeah, we get ourselves a cheesecake making robot. We've got ourselves a factory.
[14:43.910 --> 14:46.970]  I said chiefly. It doesn't necessarily mean it has to be.
[14:47.330 --> 14:50.870]  I feel like a factory needs to have a big smoke cloud.
[14:51.110 --> 14:52.150]  How about spaghetti warehouse?
[14:52.890 --> 14:54.530]  And we get the definition of warehouse.
[14:54.530 --> 14:59.090]  Warehouse. Definition.
[15:00.050 --> 15:05.770]  A large building where raw materials or manufactured goods may be stored before their export or distribution for sale.
[15:05.830 --> 15:06.610]  I would say that applies.
[15:07.430 --> 15:10.010]  How does that apply? They're selling them at the place. They're not exporting.
[15:11.050 --> 15:12.270]  Yeah, prepared for distribution or sale.
[15:12.390 --> 15:14.650]  Yeah, you're distributing it to your tummy.
[15:15.270 --> 15:15.890]  There you go.
[15:16.570 --> 15:21.030]  There's no scenario in which people are going to side with the hamburger shop.
[15:21.030 --> 15:24.450]  Is this where you wanted to be at the start of 2021?
[15:26.170 --> 15:27.230]  Arguing this point?
[15:27.710 --> 15:29.030]  Is this how you wanted to start your year?
[15:29.190 --> 15:32.670]  I didn't. I felt like it was a very straightforward thing.
[15:33.430 --> 15:37.850]  And I'm surprised that you and Gavin are backing up this factory hamburger shop nonsense.
[15:38.670 --> 15:40.030]  I mean, I...
[15:40.730 --> 15:42.350]  Hamburger sandwich shop, specifically.
[15:42.690 --> 15:46.310]  I'm fine with the hamburger shop. Hamburger sandwich shop is absurd.
[15:47.330 --> 15:49.070]  What if the person's last name is Hamburger?
[15:51.410 --> 15:52.590]  Hamburger sandwich shop.
[15:52.590 --> 15:56.230]  But they don't identify their business as the hamburger sandwich shop.
[15:56.730 --> 15:57.330]  They'd be a restaurant.
[15:57.530 --> 15:58.950]  John Hamburger Sandwich Shop.
[15:59.350 --> 16:02.630]  It's ridiculous. You're ridiculous, Geoff. You're ridiculous.
[16:03.090 --> 16:06.770]  I don't know, man. I think I got a side with Eric on this one.
[16:07.130 --> 16:07.670]  What do you mean?
[16:08.050 --> 16:08.430]  I win.
[16:08.630 --> 16:10.170]  Name a hamburger sandwich shop.
[16:10.670 --> 16:13.850]  Name one place that identifies themselves as a hamburger sandwich shop.
[16:13.890 --> 16:15.390]  I think we listed a bunch that was a hamburger sandwich shop.
[16:15.390 --> 16:18.450]  No, you didn't. You listed burger joints.
[16:18.450 --> 16:20.270]  You didn't list places that would identify as a hamburger sandwich shop.
[16:20.270 --> 16:26.510]  I'm sorry, hang on. So originally you were just disqualifying anything that had the hamburger because they sold other things.
[16:26.630 --> 16:28.650]  Now you're qualifying it as a hamburger joint.
[16:29.030 --> 16:30.710]  So you just keep moving goalposts, man.
[16:30.990 --> 16:31.990]  Do they sell joints?
[16:33.030 --> 16:34.050]  That's a great question.
[16:34.610 --> 16:37.870]  That's up to them to decide. They could, depending on what state. It's possible.
[16:38.110 --> 16:39.330]  I googled...
[16:40.090 --> 16:42.730]  I googled hamburger sandwich shop.
[16:43.350 --> 16:46.390]  Three places in town showed up.
[16:46.990 --> 16:49.910]  Luke's Inside Out, Food Heads, and Lily's Sandwich.
[16:50.410 --> 16:52.490]  50 greatest burgers in town.
[16:52.970 --> 16:53.670]  What's it in then?
[16:54.050 --> 16:59.970]  I mean, Andrew, as basic as this question could be, is a hamburger not a sandwich to you?
[17:00.970 --> 17:04.730]  I wouldn't call it that, but I'm fine if it is. I just don't think that's fun.
[17:05.190 --> 17:06.870]  I wouldn't want to refer to a hamburger as a sandwich.
[17:07.750 --> 17:11.270]  I mean, I've never referred to them as that, but I think they are, technically.
[17:11.710 --> 17:14.430]  What was the name of the place, Geoff, you said a minute ago?
[17:14.430 --> 17:16.950]  Oh, I've already moved on. I don't know.
[17:17.030 --> 17:20.110]  But I will say this, Andrew, and this may be in defense of you.
[17:20.430 --> 17:27.430]  When I googled hamburger sandwich shop in quotes, TripAdvisor returned a hamburger...
[17:28.770 --> 17:31.650]  different hamburger slash sandwich shop.
[17:32.270 --> 17:35.930]  Eric, pick a place. Pick a location for me, please.
[17:37.610 --> 17:38.490]  Dance hamburgers.
[17:38.950 --> 17:42.310]  No, no, no, no. Pick a location. Dance hamburgers? You want to go dance hamburgers?
[17:42.450 --> 17:43.350]  We can do dance hamburgers.
[17:45.590 --> 17:46.390]  Dance hamburgers...
[17:46.390 --> 17:47.450]  Are you going to call them?
[17:47.550 --> 17:52.510]  Is it Austin right now? I'm going to contact dance hamburgers and we're going to fucking settle this.
[17:52.710 --> 17:56.070]  They don't even know they're on this podcast. We can't use this.
[17:56.490 --> 17:58.750]  No, I can't. I'm not going to call them. That'd be rude.
[17:59.070 --> 18:04.350]  I also don't know where my phone is, but I'm going to send them an email right now asking if they identify.
[18:05.490 --> 18:06.350]  Andrew, what would...
[18:06.350 --> 18:07.710]  Dance hamburger shop takes a while to enter.
[18:08.030 --> 18:12.290]  While we're on the food subject, A, has your salad cream arrived yet?
[18:12.290 --> 18:18.410]  And B, have you noticed your electricity bill go down since you gave up on the burger on the waffle dream?
[18:18.690 --> 18:20.770]  I won't know the...
[18:22.510 --> 18:24.110]  Is Geoff flipping a coin?
[18:24.650 --> 18:26.110]  Are you trying to get anything with tails?
[18:27.990 --> 18:30.750]  What was your question? Salad cream hasn't arrived yet.
[18:31.390 --> 18:34.150]  And no, I get my power bill like once every month.
[18:34.650 --> 18:36.510]  Okay, so we've got to wait a few weeks still.
[18:37.010 --> 18:38.730]  Yep. I think it's two months actually.
[18:38.730 --> 18:46.830]  If you determine that there's been no consumption, like no less consumption, will you go back to waffles and hot dogs?
[18:48.310 --> 18:50.790]  I will. You know what? Actually, I forgot to set it up.
[18:51.230 --> 18:51.850]  Oh, no.
[18:52.790 --> 18:54.730]  This is a mistake. Can you hear me?
[18:55.530 --> 18:55.710]  Yeah.
[18:57.610 --> 19:01.270]  I was trying to email Dan's and I got a pinwheel.
[19:01.570 --> 19:02.890]  Oh, my email doesn't work.
[19:03.010 --> 19:04.430]  Let me close the email. Sorry.
[19:07.250 --> 19:10.070]  I don't think we made this episode less weird, guys.
[19:10.150 --> 19:11.310]  I don't think we did either.
[19:11.930 --> 19:14.550]  What was your question? I got so distracted by the hamburgers.
[19:14.930 --> 19:17.930]  Salad cream and my bill and then what were you saying, Geoff?
[19:18.310 --> 19:21.710]  I was going to say if there's no change in the bill, will you go back to...
[19:21.710 --> 19:22.410]  Oh, that's what I was going to say.
[19:22.610 --> 19:23.490]  I bought a Keurig machine.
[19:23.690 --> 19:25.030]  So I'm going to put that in the rotation.
[19:25.230 --> 19:25.710]  I was going to try coffee for the first time.
[19:25.710 --> 19:26.670]  But you don't drink coffee.
[19:26.990 --> 19:29.750]  Yeah, I was going to try it for the first time on the show.
[19:29.970 --> 19:31.410]  I just forgot to set it up.
[19:31.470 --> 19:34.370]  Because I was so consumed by SuperfanGus's website.
[19:34.410 --> 19:36.010]  I like this idea.
[19:36.310 --> 19:38.110]  Set up. Do you have it?
[19:39.670 --> 19:40.470]  I mean...
[19:40.470 --> 19:43.170]  Here, I'll tell Gavin a story.
[19:44.130 --> 19:45.690]  It's going to take a while to set up.
[19:45.690 --> 19:46.490]  Yeah, take your time.
[19:46.890 --> 19:48.590]  Dude, I used to have a Keurig.
[19:48.770 --> 19:51.230]  Plug it in, put water in the back, good to go.
[19:51.550 --> 19:53.470]  Drop a pod in 60 seconds.
[19:53.470 --> 19:55.170]  Get a non-recyclable pod in there?
[19:55.230 --> 19:57.070]  Look, we're barely 20 minutes into this.
[19:57.130 --> 19:58.770]  We've got another 40 minutes ahead of us.
[19:58.830 --> 20:00.350]  You've got plenty of time to make coffee.
[20:00.670 --> 20:02.330]  This is great. What a great way to start 2021.
[20:02.330 --> 20:04.030]  With your first cup of coffee.
[20:04.130 --> 20:05.130]  I love this idea.
[20:05.690 --> 20:07.810]  I feel like you just want to talk about something.
[20:07.910 --> 20:09.390]  And you don't want me here for it.
[20:09.630 --> 20:12.470]  No, no, no. I want to talk about anything.
[20:12.650 --> 20:13.290]  And this is anything.
[20:13.670 --> 20:15.290]  This is something happening in the podcast.
[20:15.450 --> 20:16.870]  And you can keep your headphones on, Andrew.
[20:17.610 --> 20:18.390]  No, I can't. What do you mean?
[20:18.490 --> 20:20.850]  I have to fucking walk down a flight of stairs.
[20:21.010 --> 20:21.770]  I can keep my headphones on.
[20:21.770 --> 20:23.070]  Well, that could be dangerous for you.
[20:23.410 --> 20:25.390]  What is it with you and changing floors?
[20:25.450 --> 20:27.050]  You make it sound like you're going to the airport.
[20:27.050 --> 20:28.950]  No, you're saying...
[20:28.950 --> 20:33.410]  Gavin, my headset cord is maybe 5 feet long.
[20:33.670 --> 20:35.990]  There's no way in which I can make it down there.
[20:36.250 --> 20:36.690]  How's the ankle?
[20:36.690 --> 20:37.810]  I'm not even saying that.
[20:37.870 --> 20:40.810]  I'm saying the majority of the time spent setting it up
[20:40.810 --> 20:41.890]  will be setting it up.
[20:41.910 --> 20:45.250]  Not the brief 40 seconds it takes to go downstairs and get it.
[20:45.350 --> 20:45.970]  I was just...
[20:45.970 --> 20:48.770]  I was countering that you said you could keep your headphones on.
[20:48.850 --> 20:49.850]  There's no way I could.
[20:49.890 --> 20:51.450]  You can keep it on while you're setting it up.
[20:52.150 --> 20:53.690]  I thought you meant while I get it.
[20:55.050 --> 20:56.830]  You'd be halfway done by now
[20:56.830 --> 20:58.290]  if you had left when we told you to.
[20:58.630 --> 20:59.830]  Okay, I'll go get it.
[21:00.010 --> 21:00.850]  Alright, do it.
[21:00.930 --> 21:02.630]  I'm going to go get it.
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.100]  How did everything go okay?
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.560]  What am I picking?
[21:09.640 --> 21:10.100]  What am I having?
[21:11.420 --> 21:12.240]  What are your options?
[21:12.460 --> 21:13.460]  Wow, that was fast, Andrew.
[21:13.640 --> 21:14.800]  You had gone like one minute.
[21:15.840 --> 21:17.220]  I don't have a mug.
[21:18.560 --> 21:19.360]  I'll have to get that.
[21:19.800 --> 21:22.360]  Okay, so I got dreamy creamy salted caramel.
[21:23.480 --> 21:24.460]  Options one.
[21:25.120 --> 21:25.340]  Okay.
[21:25.940 --> 21:27.220]  That was one flavor.
[21:28.050 --> 21:28.940]  Raspberry chocolate.
[21:30.110 --> 21:30.440]  Okay.
[21:30.900 --> 21:32.020]  French vanilla.
[21:34.740 --> 21:35.400]  Uh...
[21:35.400 --> 21:37.120]  Jamaican rum yum.
[21:38.620 --> 21:40.160]  I think that might be it.
[21:41.360 --> 21:42.680]  Gone bananas.
[21:42.960 --> 21:45.060]  I don't know how this machine works.
[21:45.140 --> 21:46.520]  Andrew, do you have coffee?
[21:46.860 --> 21:48.360]  Just fucking normal coffee?
[21:49.360 --> 21:50.520]  No, I...
[21:51.720 --> 21:52.400]  Um...
[21:52.400 --> 21:54.260]  Mine's sister hazelnut.
[21:54.400 --> 21:55.360]  I mean, these are all medium roast.
[21:57.100 --> 21:58.480]  Stay away from hazelnut.
[21:59.120 --> 22:00.180]  I mean...
[22:00.180 --> 22:02.780]  You don't have just like medium roast
[22:02.780 --> 22:04.220]  French drip?
[22:04.600 --> 22:05.100]  French roast?
[22:06.620 --> 22:09.720]  I got French toast roast.
[22:10.300 --> 22:11.140]  You okay with that?
[22:11.800 --> 22:12.520]  That okay?
[22:13.340 --> 22:13.720]  That okay?
[22:14.500 --> 22:15.660]  I've never...
[22:15.660 --> 22:18.520]  Those are some...
[22:19.180 --> 22:20.540]  French vanilla is probably
[22:20.540 --> 22:22.440]  your closest to
[22:22.440 --> 22:24.120]  actual coffee option there.
[22:24.680 --> 22:25.160]  Okay.
[22:26.420 --> 22:28.780]  Are we going French vanilla? Do you have an opinion on this, Gavin?
[22:29.900 --> 22:30.380]  No.
[22:31.260 --> 22:31.740]  Okay.
[22:32.380 --> 22:33.440]  How do I do this?
[22:33.560 --> 22:35.880]  Do I just put it in the machine and hit go?
[22:36.240 --> 22:38.740]  Well, did you fill the reservoir with water?
[22:38.920 --> 22:39.060]  Yeah.
[22:39.420 --> 22:40.640]  Yeah, I did the water thing.
[22:41.160 --> 22:43.440]  Is it plugged into an outlet?
[22:43.900 --> 22:44.620]  It's plugged in.
[22:44.620 --> 22:46.340]  Are you prepared to spend the electricity?
[22:46.960 --> 22:48.400]  Yes, I'm prepared. I got the bits.
[22:48.900 --> 22:49.740]  I got the bolts.
[22:50.120 --> 22:52.140]  Just like stick the cup in.
[22:53.160 --> 22:54.640]  Close the thing and then
[22:54.640 --> 22:55.440]  hit the go button.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.340]  There was like a teabag in there. What do I do with the teabag?
[22:58.560 --> 22:59.980]  Take it out?
[23:00.400 --> 23:01.720]  But what do I do with it?
[23:02.080 --> 23:03.020]  It was in its own box.
[23:04.480 --> 23:06.100]  There was like a teabag thing.
[23:06.420 --> 23:07.700]  Put it in a drawer? I don't know.
[23:08.100 --> 23:09.520]  I was just curious. It was weird.
[23:10.280 --> 23:11.700]  Mine didn't come with a teabag.
[23:18.090 --> 23:19.370]  Should we talk about how
[23:20.230 --> 23:21.470]  until last week
[23:22.090 --> 23:23.770]  I didn't know that people listened
[23:23.770 --> 23:24.470]  to this podcast.
[23:25.630 --> 23:27.050]  Oh, did you want to talk about that?
[23:27.350 --> 23:28.030]  That's funny.
[23:28.650 --> 23:30.610]  So like a couple of months ago
[23:32.250 --> 23:33.810]  I was talking to Geoff
[23:33.810 --> 23:35.630]  about just life and stuff
[23:35.630 --> 23:37.370]  and you were telling me about
[23:38.130 --> 23:40.090]  how no one listened to F*** Face
[23:40.090 --> 23:41.810]  and it was like ranking bottom
[23:41.810 --> 23:43.510]  among all the recent podcasts.
[23:44.470 --> 23:45.950]  And I was like, oh, that sucks.
[23:45.950 --> 23:47.590]  I think it's pretty good.
[23:47.650 --> 23:49.250]  I think we have fun making it.
[23:49.310 --> 23:50.570]  It's a shame that no one listens to it.
[23:51.050 --> 23:53.310]  And I thought that for months, last week
[23:54.630 --> 23:55.910]  Geoff and Eric were just talking
[23:55.910 --> 23:57.830]  about the performance of F*** Face.
[23:58.090 --> 24:00.050]  It's like number two in the whole company.
[24:00.630 --> 24:02.050]  Yeah, it's behind the RT podcast
[24:02.410 --> 24:03.890]  and I'm hoping that we'll take that over
[24:03.890 --> 24:04.690]  before too long too.
[24:04.850 --> 24:06.790]  And I was like, wait, people do listen to this?
[24:06.870 --> 24:08.950]  And you were like, oh yeah, I just told you no one listened to it
[24:08.950 --> 24:09.890]  so you'd work harder.
[24:11.310 --> 24:12.210]  What does that mean?
[24:12.210 --> 24:14.050]  If anything, maybe work
[24:14.050 --> 24:15.530]  less hard because I was like
[24:17.390 --> 24:17.830]  well...
[24:17.830 --> 24:19.690]  No, I know you. I know you.
[24:19.810 --> 24:22.310]  If you think it's like... I think you'll try harder.
[24:23.030 --> 24:23.910]  What do you mean try harder?
[24:23.910 --> 24:25.170]  How do you try on a podcast?
[24:25.730 --> 24:27.870]  The podcast isn't doing well. Be funnier.
[24:28.950 --> 24:30.430]  You can't just...
[24:30.430 --> 24:32.390]  I'm not there every week being like
[24:32.390 --> 24:34.510]  oh man, if more people were listening
[24:34.510 --> 24:35.690]  I would turn up the funny.
[24:35.910 --> 24:38.270]  No, I was slightly demoralized.
[24:38.430 --> 24:40.590]  I was feeling a bit sad for the next few months
[24:40.590 --> 24:42.790]  because I believed
[24:42.790 --> 24:44.410]  it was pretty decent.
[24:45.090 --> 24:47.130]  Now you tell me you were lying the whole time.
[24:47.910 --> 24:49.250]  Like it's going to make it...
[24:49.250 --> 24:51.150]  Gavin, it's doing incredibly well
[24:51.150 --> 24:52.570]  up until the last two podcasts
[24:52.570 --> 24:54.070]  it's been doing incredibly well.
[24:54.470 --> 24:56.290]  I have no idea how these two are going to be receiving.
[24:56.570 --> 24:58.230]  So like in conversation with other people
[24:58.230 --> 25:00.470]  like if Trevor's talking to me about Red Web
[25:00.470 --> 25:02.430]  or something, I've always just been like
[25:02.430 --> 25:04.230]  yeah, shame about it.
[25:04.390 --> 25:08.670]  He must have been like, what are you talking about?
[25:09.570 --> 25:10.810]  It's one of the
[25:10.810 --> 25:12.710]  most listened to podcasts we do
[25:12.710 --> 25:13.970]  in the entire company.
[25:14.250 --> 25:16.450]  It is like, it does
[25:16.450 --> 25:18.910]  it does so well.
[25:19.450 --> 25:20.530]  I'll be honest
[25:20.530 --> 25:22.510]  between episodes like
[25:22.510 --> 25:24.230]  8 and 30
[25:24.230 --> 25:26.950]  I thought it was like the dreads of the list.
[25:27.690 --> 25:28.630]  And I was
[25:28.630 --> 25:30.230]  actually bummed about it.
[25:30.770 --> 25:32.830]  It's been doing
[25:32.830 --> 25:34.730]  so well for like
[25:34.730 --> 25:36.610]  a while now and like
[25:36.610 --> 25:38.670]  and that's thanks to everyone who listens
[25:38.670 --> 25:40.550]  and everything. Are you going to like
[25:40.550 --> 25:42.770]  coast now? Like how are you going to
[25:42.770 --> 25:43.230]  change?
[25:43.610 --> 25:46.610]  My point is it can't affect my
[25:46.610 --> 25:48.390]  performance. I was just sad.
[25:48.970 --> 25:50.150]  Well you just said if
[25:50.150 --> 25:50.990]  anything
[25:52.510 --> 25:54.390]  it made you work less
[25:54.390 --> 25:56.610]  so now that you know it's successful you're going to work
[25:56.610 --> 25:58.590]  harder so we can expect a better version of
[25:58.590 --> 25:59.210]  Gavin's performance.
[25:59.230 --> 26:01.750]  That's the stupidest mindset ever.
[26:02.530 --> 26:04.410]  Why'd you always
[26:04.410 --> 26:06.590]  lie about the most pointless thing?
[26:10.210 --> 26:12.390]  I believed that you were bummed
[26:12.390 --> 26:14.470]  as well. You were like proper
[26:14.470 --> 26:16.190]  giving it like yeah I mean
[26:17.370 --> 26:18.410]  I hope
[26:18.410 --> 26:20.450]  the views pick up otherwise we won't be able to make
[26:20.450 --> 26:20.950]  it anymore.
[26:21.950 --> 26:22.910]  Here's the deal.
[26:25.130 --> 26:26.350]  The day we had
[26:26.350 --> 26:28.570]  that conversation I think that was true.
[26:28.790 --> 26:30.370]  It was just only true for
[26:30.370 --> 26:31.510]  like another three days.
[26:34.470 --> 26:34.910]  I
[26:34.910 --> 26:36.770]  just never updated you
[26:36.770 --> 26:38.070]  when things were going well
[26:38.070 --> 26:39.270]  because I didn't see the point.
[26:41.250 --> 26:41.850]  Yeah you
[26:41.850 --> 26:44.030]  were talking to Eric about it I think a couple
[26:44.030 --> 26:45.770]  of weeks ago after we ended it. I was
[26:45.770 --> 26:47.530]  blown away. I was like what?
[26:48.330 --> 26:50.050]  Yeah it's doing super well.
[26:50.430 --> 26:51.810]  I just hit myself with coffee.
[26:52.630 --> 26:53.630]  It's my first experience.
[26:54.530 --> 26:55.370]  Was it hot?
[26:56.990 --> 26:58.230]  Yes it was.
[26:58.990 --> 26:59.550]  Yes it was.
[27:00.190 --> 27:01.470]  While you two were talking
[27:01.470 --> 27:03.650]  I was just going fuck because I just
[27:03.650 --> 27:05.130]  threw coffee in my face.
[27:06.470 --> 27:07.870]  Why can't you operate
[27:08.390 --> 27:09.790]  basic things like mugs?
[27:11.050 --> 27:11.650]  It's a big
[27:11.650 --> 27:13.510]  mug and I wanted to get a good whiff
[27:13.510 --> 27:15.510]  so I was like ooh I'm going to spin the liquid
[27:15.510 --> 27:17.550]  around a little bit and it rode right up the cup
[27:17.550 --> 27:19.670]  hit me in the forehead. Not good.
[27:19.950 --> 27:21.070]  Andrew did you know that
[27:21.070 --> 27:22.810]  this podcast is doing alright?
[27:23.810 --> 27:25.390]  Yeah I was here last week. What do you mean?
[27:26.090 --> 27:27.490]  Of course I do.
[27:27.490 --> 27:28.570]  It's a great content Gavin.
[27:28.830 --> 27:30.650]  Before that, did you know?
[27:30.690 --> 27:32.070]  What do you mean? Oh.
[27:32.550 --> 27:33.970]  I don't care.
[27:34.130 --> 27:37.870]  I hope it does but I don't think about it.
[27:37.910 --> 27:39.730]  That's a performer right there.
[27:39.950 --> 27:41.110]  He's doing this for him.
[27:41.390 --> 27:43.590]  He's not worried about the numbers.
[27:43.830 --> 27:45.110]  He's doing it for the fans
[27:45.110 --> 27:47.390]  and that's great. He's a real podcaster.
[27:47.870 --> 27:49.450]  I still did it
[27:49.450 --> 27:51.250]  all those 20 weeks
[27:51.250 --> 27:53.050]  that I thought it was shit. I was doing it
[27:53.050 --> 27:55.790]  for the love as well. I was just sad at the same time.
[27:56.390 --> 27:57.490]  Here's the deal Gavin.
[27:57.610 --> 27:59.010]  I didn't want to have to stop making it.
[27:59.510 --> 28:01.170]  I feel like our friendship
[28:02.670 --> 28:03.730]  operates at it's
[28:03.730 --> 28:05.130]  highest level of
[28:05.890 --> 28:07.450]  efficiency and success
[28:07.450 --> 28:09.830]  when we trust each
[28:09.830 --> 28:11.390]  other and what comes out of our mouth
[28:11.390 --> 28:12.670]  less and less.
[28:13.890 --> 28:15.350]  I want you to question
[28:15.350 --> 28:17.450]  everything I tell you for the rest of your life.
[28:17.570 --> 28:19.450]  And I feel like, by the way,
[28:19.750 --> 28:21.530]  I feel like I've been displaying that for
[28:21.530 --> 28:23.850]  years. I don't feel like this is a new thing.
[28:24.710 --> 28:25.790]  This is just a continuation
[28:25.790 --> 28:27.890]  of the lineage
[28:27.890 --> 28:29.610]  of the tenure of
[28:31.310 --> 28:32.110]  our manipulating
[28:32.110 --> 28:33.950]  and lying to each other. Yeah, I just feel
[28:33.950 --> 28:35.890]  like I should trust you less by
[28:35.890 --> 28:37.550]  now. And I don't for some reason.
[28:40.530 --> 28:41.850]  Hey, in all seriousness
[28:41.850 --> 28:43.210]  Gavin, congratulations on
[28:44.670 --> 28:45.830]  your assistance in the
[28:45.830 --> 28:47.030]  success of this podcast. You're doing great.
[28:47.030 --> 28:49.030]  I was just very...
[28:51.550 --> 28:53.030]  Jesus Christ. What the
[28:53.030 --> 28:55.190]  fuck? Coughing like he smoked a
[28:55.190 --> 28:55.610]  cigarette.
[28:56.810 --> 28:58.190]  People drink this?
[28:59.170 --> 29:00.970]  What was that? Oh my god.
[29:01.090 --> 29:02.710]  How do you live every...
[29:02.710 --> 29:04.770]  How do you survive day to day?
[29:05.730 --> 29:06.990]  What does that mean?
[29:07.490 --> 29:08.550]  What do you mean by that?
[29:08.670 --> 29:10.990]  This is horrendous. What don't you
[29:10.990 --> 29:12.610]  like about it? Everything.
[29:13.070 --> 29:15.010]  It'd be easier to answer what I do like
[29:15.010 --> 29:16.730]  about it. What do you like about it? The smell.
[29:16.810 --> 29:19.070]  The smell is okay. Everything else, not good.
[29:19.190 --> 29:20.710]  This isn't good. What is it?
[29:20.930 --> 29:22.970]  So take us through it. Did you have a...
[29:22.970 --> 29:24.750]  Did you gulp it? Did you have just a sip?
[29:24.850 --> 29:26.890]  I just... I try... I mean it's too hot
[29:26.890 --> 29:29.070]  to gulp. I was gonna gulp it, but I took a
[29:29.070 --> 29:30.870]  sip and it's just... it's terrible.
[29:31.290 --> 29:32.310]  This is not good.
[29:32.870 --> 29:34.270]  Why did I buy a coffee machine?
[29:35.170 --> 29:36.930]  Well, I'll tell you. I'll be honest with you
[29:36.930 --> 29:39.070]  dude. You got a bunch of weird ass flavors.
[29:39.550 --> 29:41.090]  None of those flavors sound like coffee.
[29:41.590 --> 29:42.430]  Coffee is great.
[29:43.050 --> 29:44.510]  It's when you start adding hazelnut
[29:44.510 --> 29:45.550]  and shit to it that it gets weird.
[29:46.150 --> 29:47.670]  You might be a person,
[29:48.110 --> 29:49.810]  and I would caution against it,
[29:50.710 --> 29:51.870]  I've said this many times,
[29:52.430 --> 29:54.330]  your life will be easier if you just drink
[29:54.330 --> 29:56.390]  black coffee, but you might be one of those people
[29:56.390 --> 29:58.370]  that needs a little bit of milk or cream
[29:58.370 --> 30:00.130]  or sugar or Splenda
[30:00.130 --> 30:02.070]  and you need to find that ratio
[30:03.090 --> 30:04.750]  where you gotta like de-coffee
[30:04.750 --> 30:06.430]  it a little bit and sweeten it up
[30:06.430 --> 30:08.710]  to get it to appease
[30:08.710 --> 30:10.190]  your palate. I can't. Okay.
[30:10.890 --> 30:11.970]  We're gonna try something.
[30:12.010 --> 30:12.730]  This is a mistake.
[30:16.230 --> 30:17.890]  Sweeten, right? That's what you do with coffee?
[30:18.330 --> 30:20.190]  Like if you think it's too bitter, you sweeten it?
[30:21.130 --> 30:22.290]  That's what a lot of people do, yeah.
[30:23.190 --> 30:24.570]  I just dropped like...
[30:24.570 --> 30:25.590]  How many are these?
[30:25.830 --> 30:27.130]  1, 2, 3, 4...
[30:27.130 --> 30:28.670]  What are you putting in there?
[30:29.290 --> 30:30.190]  Sounds like ice.
[30:31.090 --> 30:34.390]  I have these Maynard Sour Patch Kids
[30:34.390 --> 30:35.230]  watermelon things.
[30:36.110 --> 30:36.810]  They're sweet.
[30:37.670 --> 30:38.410]  They're sweet.
[30:38.810 --> 30:40.730]  Do they melt? They'll melt. They melt in your mouth.
[30:40.830 --> 30:41.990]  So why wouldn't they melt in the coffee?
[30:43.170 --> 30:44.950]  So wait, you're adding sour to bitter?
[30:45.810 --> 30:46.710]  I guess, yeah.
[30:46.750 --> 30:48.290]  I just dropped like a bunch of like
[30:48.690 --> 30:51.090]  sour Maynard's watermelon things in.
[30:51.190 --> 30:52.830]  Do you think that will cancel it out?
[30:53.050 --> 30:54.030]  Or do you think that will...
[30:54.030 --> 30:56.430]  What's that gonna do? What does sour-bitter taste like?
[30:56.950 --> 30:58.230]  It can't taste worse.
[30:58.910 --> 31:00.950]  I'm putting something in. Maybe it'll taste better.
[31:01.330 --> 31:02.210]  I'm adding stuff to the mix.
[31:02.210 --> 31:04.610]  I think you might find out it can taste worse.
[31:05.230 --> 31:06.590]  I don't have really any...
[31:06.590 --> 31:08.950]  I have a sugar cookie on my desk. Should I put that in too?
[31:09.150 --> 31:09.990]  No! Sugar!
[31:10.670 --> 31:12.090]  You're putting food into your coffee.
[31:12.670 --> 31:13.810]  Yes, you're asking.
[31:14.130 --> 31:15.790]  You said I need to make it sweeter.
[31:16.090 --> 31:17.810]  I don't have any sweet stuff.
[31:17.870 --> 31:20.630]  I'm grabbing what I have. I've got a fucking sugar cookie.
[31:21.150 --> 31:22.890]  I could put a bit of the sugar cookie in there.
[31:22.990 --> 31:23.990]  That has icing in it.
[31:24.450 --> 31:26.850]  You know what you should do, dude?
[31:26.950 --> 31:28.470]  There's actually sugar on the cookie.
[31:28.590 --> 31:29.410]  I'm putting the cookie in.
[31:29.610 --> 31:32.450]  Dip the cookie in the coffee.
[31:32.450 --> 31:33.770]  It's already in the coffee.
[31:33.890 --> 31:35.870]  You put the whole thing in?
[31:36.390 --> 31:38.070]  Yeah, I just put the cookie in the coffee.
[31:38.250 --> 31:39.030]  You're an animal.
[31:40.510 --> 31:42.810]  Go downstairs and get sugar.
[31:43.810 --> 31:46.430]  No, I've already been gone for 15 minutes.
[31:46.510 --> 31:47.270]  I'm not leaving again.
[31:47.530 --> 31:48.230]  It's bubbling.
[31:48.810 --> 31:50.050]  This is bubbling.
[31:50.450 --> 31:52.590]  I also have Honey Nut Cheerios nearby.
[31:52.830 --> 31:55.230]  Stop putting food in your coffee!
[31:55.750 --> 31:57.250]  The Honey Nut Cheerios is not going to help.
[31:57.650 --> 31:59.290]  Why wouldn't the Honey Nut Cheerios help?
[31:59.370 --> 32:00.550]  Because that's also sweet.
[32:00.550 --> 32:01.790]  There's a nice honey flavor.
[32:02.010 --> 32:04.510]  I've added sugar through the sugar cookie.
[32:04.670 --> 32:06.830]  Oh, it's corn, wheat, coffee, Cheerios!
[32:07.630 --> 32:09.090]  Let's pour some Cheerios in.
[32:09.190 --> 32:11.050]  It's something other than coffee now.
[32:11.530 --> 32:11.890]  Okay.
[32:12.270 --> 32:14.330]  So I have some honey in there.
[32:14.670 --> 32:16.210]  They're like marshmallows almost.
[32:17.590 --> 32:18.110]  Um...
[32:18.110 --> 32:20.450]  This is really...
[32:20.450 --> 32:22.770]  The first cup of coffee you've ever had.
[32:23.190 --> 32:23.410]  Yeah.
[32:23.950 --> 32:25.190]  I had one sip. It was no good.
[32:25.770 --> 32:26.410]  This might be better.
[32:26.410 --> 32:27.990]  He's making soup.
[32:28.110 --> 32:28.650]  This is soup.
[32:30.170 --> 32:30.990]  I'll take a photo.
[32:31.150 --> 32:33.230]  This is like when Millie was like two.
[32:33.730 --> 32:35.830]  And she would cook for me.
[32:36.930 --> 32:38.410]  She'd be like...
[32:39.030 --> 32:40.530]  Here's a bunch of flathead screws
[32:40.530 --> 32:42.650]  in an open can of chicken noodle soup.
[32:43.170 --> 32:43.910]  I made it for you.
[32:44.570 --> 32:45.310]  This looks delicious.
[32:45.490 --> 32:47.770]  Have you had any yet?
[32:48.430 --> 32:49.370]  No, I'm just taking a photo.
[32:49.710 --> 32:51.250]  Post in the Discord.
[32:52.790 --> 32:53.930]  It's going to be soggy.
[32:53.930 --> 32:56.650]  This might be the first ever
[32:57.350 --> 32:58.350]  f*** face recipe.
[32:58.490 --> 32:59.750]  This could go towards our recipe book.
[32:59.810 --> 33:00.750]  Oh, the recipe book.
[33:01.590 --> 33:02.670]  You might not like this.
[33:03.070 --> 33:04.390]  It does not look good.
[33:04.710 --> 33:07.550]  We'll throw that in with the wetsuit guts
[33:07.550 --> 33:08.570]  and the doorknobs.
[33:08.770 --> 33:09.810]  The ab warmer.
[33:12.110 --> 33:13.190]  What on earth?
[33:13.270 --> 33:14.450]  There's no coffee in there.
[33:15.550 --> 33:16.590]  Dude, that's so f***ing gross.
[33:17.230 --> 33:19.270]  That's a cookie and Cheerios
[33:19.270 --> 33:20.190]  at the bottom of a mug.
[33:20.910 --> 33:22.270]  No, there's actually
[33:22.270 --> 33:23.930]  a decent amount of liquid. It's a big mug.
[33:24.330 --> 33:25.550]  It's a really long mug.
[33:26.330 --> 33:27.130]  That's so gross.
[33:28.730 --> 33:30.150]  Yeah, Nick's right. It looks like a
[33:30.150 --> 33:32.370]  f***ed up ramen cup. That's exactly what it looks like.
[33:32.390 --> 33:34.130]  It does look like a ramen cup.
[33:34.270 --> 33:35.670]  It looks like beef ramen noodles.
[33:36.670 --> 33:37.950]  It's f***ing gross, dude.
[33:39.050 --> 33:41.410]  How's it taste, though?
[33:42.010 --> 33:42.430]  Honestly?
[33:43.310 --> 33:44.750]  I got banned for spamming.
[33:45.490 --> 33:47.510]  I was trying to get it off the screen.
[33:48.610 --> 33:49.210]  Honestly?
[33:49.790 --> 33:50.250]  Yeah.
[33:50.770 --> 33:51.690]  I could drink this.
[33:52.950 --> 33:54.150]  You would drink that?
[33:57.290 --> 33:57.990]  This is...
[33:57.990 --> 34:00.190]  This is substantially better.
[34:01.170 --> 34:03.030]  Got a little bit of crunch with the Cheerios.
[34:03.750 --> 34:04.630]  It's not that bad.
[34:06.210 --> 34:06.810]  I...
[34:07.790 --> 34:09.870]  You're either getting weirder by the week
[34:09.870 --> 34:11.370]  or you were just
[34:11.370 --> 34:13.310]  hiding it better at the beginning.
[34:14.310 --> 34:15.970]  I would never order this
[34:15.970 --> 34:18.110]  but it doesn't taste as strong
[34:18.110 --> 34:18.570]  as it did.
[34:18.650 --> 34:21.810]  Why would you never order coffee with Cheerios
[34:21.810 --> 34:22.790]  and a cookie in it?
[34:23.250 --> 34:25.470]  There's actually a really bad back taste. This isn't good.
[34:26.690 --> 34:27.950]  This isn't good at all.
[34:29.470 --> 34:30.610]  That sneaks up
[34:30.610 --> 34:31.870]  on you. That back taste.
[34:32.550 --> 34:33.990]  Is that the same as an aftertaste
[34:33.990 --> 34:36.370]  or is that a taste specifically in the back of your mouth?
[34:36.750 --> 34:37.830]  No, it's like a back...
[34:37.830 --> 34:40.310]  You thought the taste went down.
[34:40.530 --> 34:42.190]  You thought it was gone and then it crawled
[34:42.190 --> 34:43.750]  back up and is like, I got more
[34:43.750 --> 34:44.570]  of it. It's not good.
[34:44.970 --> 34:48.370]  What is that shit stain on the left side of the mug?
[34:49.190 --> 34:49.910]  Oh, it was a hot
[34:49.910 --> 34:50.530]  chocolate mug.
[34:51.510 --> 34:53.270]  Wait, it's an old mug?
[34:53.430 --> 34:53.790]  It's a dirty mug?
[34:55.210 --> 34:56.630]  It's the only mug I had.
[34:57.170 --> 34:59.590]  So you made coffee in a dirty, hot
[34:59.590 --> 35:00.470]  chocolate mug?
[35:00.770 --> 35:03.490]  Well, that's contaminated the experiment!
[35:04.110 --> 35:05.270]  You went downstairs
[35:05.270 --> 35:07.010]  and you came back with a dirty mug?
[35:07.590 --> 35:09.750]  I never went downstairs. I had one on my desk
[35:09.750 --> 35:11.790]  and it had hot chocolate at the bottom
[35:11.790 --> 35:13.430]  of it. I was like, I'm not going to go
[35:13.430 --> 35:13.990]  downstairs.
[35:14.350 --> 35:16.970]  I'm going to be honest with you, Andrew.
[35:17.110 --> 35:19.690]  I still don't think you've tried coffee now.
[35:20.370 --> 35:21.990]  What you're drinking is not coffee.
[35:23.370 --> 35:23.890]  Can I
[35:23.890 --> 35:25.050]  ask a question about the hot chocolate?
[35:25.590 --> 35:26.610]  When was that from?
[35:27.770 --> 35:29.650]  Last night. Okay, that's not too bad.
[35:30.090 --> 35:30.970]  It's still disgusting.
[35:31.630 --> 35:32.690]  It's not terrible, though.
[35:33.070 --> 35:35.710]  What time did you have hot chocolate last night?
[35:36.710 --> 35:37.530]  I don't know, like
[35:37.530 --> 35:38.810]  10pm maybe? It was late.
[35:38.810 --> 35:40.110]  It's a late night hot chocolate.
[35:40.130 --> 35:40.910]  What prompted you?
[35:42.030 --> 35:44.570]  Just a little hot chocolate at night.
[35:44.690 --> 35:46.570]  It's pretty good. Was that to settle your tummy
[35:46.570 --> 35:47.570]  before you go to bed or something?
[35:48.590 --> 35:50.690]  No, it's just you enjoy a nice cup of
[35:50.690 --> 35:52.110]  hot chocolate. It's the time, Geoff.
[35:52.290 --> 35:54.310]  Did you make it or did someone make it for you?
[35:54.390 --> 35:54.990]  I made it.
[35:56.670 --> 35:57.870]  You heat some milk,
[35:58.610 --> 35:59.870]  pour in the mix, stir it.
[36:00.310 --> 36:01.290]  Did you use water or milk?
[36:02.250 --> 36:03.070]  I used milk.
[36:03.990 --> 36:06.530]  I used to use water. I'm now a milk guy.
[36:07.030 --> 36:09.610]  Did it have marshmallows in it?
[36:09.830 --> 36:10.210]  Yeah, it did.
[36:10.310 --> 36:11.810]  It had some marshmallows, whipped cream.
[36:12.350 --> 36:13.250]  It was fantastic.
[36:13.270 --> 36:13.770]  That's pretty good.

[36:49.550 --> 36:51.610]  Okay, so it's 2021.
[36:52.230 --> 36:53.490]  We're ready to put
[36:53.490 --> 36:55.850]  2020 in the rearview
[36:55.850 --> 36:56.350]  mirror.
[36:56.930 --> 36:59.350]  Hey, real quick though, take a look back there,
[36:59.430 --> 37:01.330]  and what do you see? That's right, it's your
[37:01.330 --> 37:03.730]  butthole. You've been neglecting
[37:03.730 --> 37:05.830]  it. I've been telling you for a long time,
[37:06.690 --> 37:07.810]  yes, run from
[37:07.810 --> 37:09.910]  2020, but don't run from your
[37:09.910 --> 37:11.810]  own anal comfort. You need this.
[37:12.130 --> 37:13.590]  So pay attention. We're talking about TUSHY.
[37:14.010 --> 37:15.810]  It's the future of toileting.
[37:15.970 --> 37:17.490]  It's technically been around for centuries,
[37:17.830 --> 37:19.710]  but it's been expensive
[37:19.710 --> 37:21.910]  and it's cost thousands of dollars, and
[37:21.910 --> 37:23.890]  as an American, if you're an American
[37:23.890 --> 37:25.730]  you know what I mean, it wasn't readily
[37:25.730 --> 37:27.730]  available for us here. I get that it's all
[37:27.730 --> 37:29.510]  over Europe, they're very refined people,
[37:29.990 --> 37:31.710]  they have very sophisticated
[37:31.710 --> 37:33.890]  buttholes in Europe
[37:33.890 --> 37:35.590]  and other parts of the world, but we were definitely
[37:35.590 --> 37:37.950]  lagging here in America. But thank
[37:37.950 --> 37:39.550]  God, the brand new
[37:39.550 --> 37:41.750]  Hello TUSHY 3.0 Modern Bidet
[37:41.750 --> 37:43.790]  Attachment is here to level that playing
[37:43.790 --> 37:45.890]  field. And not just for us, I think
[37:45.890 --> 37:47.010]  you can use it too, Europe.
[37:47.530 --> 37:50.150]  It's for everybody. Let's all, let's democratize
[37:50.150 --> 37:51.030]  our buttholes, right?
[37:51.510 --> 37:53.870]  It's stylish, it's eco-friendly, it's easy to
[37:53.870 --> 37:55.190]  install, it's affordable,
[37:55.630 --> 37:57.850]  and it doesn't just cleanse your butt, it does so
[37:57.850 --> 37:59.610]  with a precise stream of fresh water.
[37:59.730 --> 38:01.850]  And I don't know if you've ever squirted water in your
[38:01.850 --> 38:03.910]  butt. Maybe
[38:03.910 --> 38:05.770]  it sounds a little weird at first, but I'm telling
[38:05.770 --> 38:07.270]  you, it's a clean
[38:07.730 --> 38:10.150]  like you want to experience.
[38:10.450 --> 38:12.090]  And once you have it, it's intoxicating.
[38:12.390 --> 38:13.810]  It's an intoxicating way to clean
[38:13.810 --> 38:16.130]  yourself, I'll say it. You'll never get enough of it.
[38:16.310 --> 38:17.990]  It cleans itself also,
[38:18.430 --> 38:19.370]  not just you,
[38:19.830 --> 38:21.910]  because it's got this smart spray
[38:21.910 --> 38:23.670]  automatic self-cleaning nozzle thing,
[38:23.870 --> 38:25.490]  so it takes care of all the
[38:25.490 --> 38:27.810]  dirty on you and it, which is
[38:27.810 --> 38:29.930]  super convenient. And you're gonna save on
[38:29.930 --> 38:31.830]  toilet paper. You're not gonna use nearly
[38:31.830 --> 38:33.350]  the toilet paper you used to use.
[38:33.670 --> 38:36.030]  You're not gonna be driving to the store
[38:36.030 --> 38:37.890]  to buy toilet paper as often as you
[38:37.890 --> 38:39.190]  were, so you're gonna save in gas.
[38:39.530 --> 38:41.890]  And the trees will thank you. Plus,

[39:03.650 --> 39:05.410]  How do you choose which internet service
[39:05.410 --> 39:07.750]  provider to use? The sad thing is
[39:07.750 --> 39:09.490]  most of us have very little choice
[39:09.490 --> 39:11.690]  because ISPs operate like monopolies
[39:11.690 --> 39:12.890]  in the regions that they serve.
[39:13.110 --> 39:15.590]  They then use this monopoly power to take advantage
[39:15.590 --> 39:17.470]  of customers. Like, uh,
[39:17.490 --> 39:19.430]  when your friend owns every
[39:19.430 --> 39:21.510]  property on one entire side of
[39:21.510 --> 39:22.830]  the monopoly board, and
[39:23.350 --> 39:25.590]  there's no way you can get out of there unscathed. They take advantage
[39:25.590 --> 39:27.870]  of you. Data caps, streaming
[39:27.870 --> 39:29.610]  throttles, the list goes on.
[39:30.190 --> 39:31.450]  Uh, plus St. James,
[39:31.590 --> 39:33.630]  the whole thing. But worst of all, many
[39:33.630 --> 39:35.570]  ISPs log your internet activity and
[39:35.570 --> 39:37.570]  sell that data to other big tech companies
[39:37.570 --> 39:39.690]  or advertisers. To prevent ISPs
[39:39.690 --> 39:41.590]  from seeing my internet activity, and you know
[39:41.590 --> 39:43.610]  what I'm talking about, it's thimble related,
[39:43.890 --> 39:45.650]  it's decorative spoon related,
[39:45.990 --> 39:47.610]  it's highly collectible, it's highly
[39:47.610 --> 39:49.550]  sought after, and it's my private
[39:49.550 --> 39:51.910]  information. I protect all of my devices
[39:51.910 --> 39:53.310]  with ExpressVPN.
[39:53.310 --> 39:55.410]  So what is ExpressVPN?
[39:55.910 --> 39:57.250]  Well, it's a simple app for your
[39:57.250 --> 39:59.230]  computer or smartphone that encrypts all your
[39:59.230 --> 40:01.090]  network data and tunnels it through a secure
[40:01.090 --> 40:03.250]  VPN server so that your ISP
[40:03.250 --> 40:05.270]  can't see any of your activity. Just
[40:05.270 --> 40:06.750]  think about how much of your life is on the internet.
[40:07.170 --> 40:09.330]  Sadly, every site you visit, video
[40:09.330 --> 40:11.130]  you watch, or message you send gets
[40:11.130 --> 40:13.270]  tracked by ISPs or other tech giants
[40:13.270 --> 40:15.250]  who can then sell that information for
[40:15.250 --> 40:17.590]  profit. That's the reason I recommend ExpressVPN
[40:17.590 --> 40:19.110]  as the best way to hide your

[41:05.830 --> 41:07.070]  Speaking of weird
[41:07.990 --> 41:09.130]  liquids and beverages,
[41:09.350 --> 41:10.690]  this is gonna... I think this photo's sideways.
[41:10.850 --> 41:12.850]  Maybe it isn't. I don't know. So I have a dilemma.
[41:13.030 --> 41:14.550]  I've been meaning to bring this up for weeks now.
[41:15.710 --> 41:16.990]  Do you remember when...
[41:17.410 --> 41:18.790]  How long ago, Geoff, was it
[41:18.790 --> 41:20.930]  when I made that... Do you remember how long the waffle video
[41:20.930 --> 41:22.990]  was? Uh, it's been about a month.
[41:23.210 --> 41:24.630]  Maybe. It's been about a month?
[41:24.830 --> 41:25.490]  Three weeks to a month, yeah.
[41:26.670 --> 41:28.830]  What I did, because it was when my ankle was
[41:28.830 --> 41:30.890]  fucked up, so I didn't have... I just
[41:30.890 --> 41:32.830]  needed to use something to mix everything, so
[41:32.830 --> 41:34.850]  I was using a water bottle, and I
[41:34.850 --> 41:37.030]  put everything in that. I didn't end up
[41:37.030 --> 41:37.930]  using all the mix.
[41:38.910 --> 41:40.650]  I still have that water bottle
[41:40.650 --> 41:42.950]  with mix in it, and I don't know what to do with it.
[41:43.230 --> 41:45.050]  Oh, throw it away. I'm scared.
[41:45.050 --> 41:46.450]  I don't know. I'm scared to touch it.
[41:46.530 --> 41:48.830]  It's inflated, but I also am concerned
[41:48.830 --> 41:49.610]  it might explode.
[41:50.830 --> 41:52.770]  Oh, no. Oh, my God.
[41:53.270 --> 41:54.610]  It just keeps inflating.
[41:56.690 --> 41:57.170]  Uh...
[41:57.170 --> 41:58.530]  I would leave it alone.
[42:00.070 --> 42:01.130]  I'm scared to
[42:01.130 --> 42:03.290]  touch it. Do you live in filth?
[42:03.610 --> 42:04.390]  Do you? Are you? No.
[42:05.310 --> 42:07.070]  No. I'm a very clean person.
[42:07.430 --> 42:09.190]  It just was kind of tucked to the side
[42:09.190 --> 42:10.710]  of my bathroom countertop.
[42:10.970 --> 42:12.670]  I just never paid attention to it.
[42:12.670 --> 42:14.590]  And then one day, I looked at it and was like,
[42:15.030 --> 42:16.710]  that's not good, and I went to touch it.
[42:16.850 --> 42:18.090]  It was very inflated.
[42:18.630 --> 42:20.890]  I'm scared to touch it, and I don't really...
[42:20.890 --> 42:22.770]  How do I dispose of it? Yeah, it releases tons
[42:22.770 --> 42:23.390]  of gas.
[42:24.410 --> 42:26.750]  I don't know what to do. I would just
[42:26.750 --> 42:28.630]  let it... I would let it
[42:28.630 --> 42:29.710]  play out its
[42:31.710 --> 42:32.510]  natural progression.
[42:32.890 --> 42:34.330]  Just keep it as is? Yeah.
[42:34.470 --> 42:35.890]  I would just see what happens. Document it.
[42:36.690 --> 42:38.470]  I kind of am. Oh, dude.
[42:38.470 --> 42:39.910]  Do you have a tape measure?
[42:40.910 --> 42:41.310]  No.
[42:42.130 --> 42:44.110]  Oh, you could get one, and you could measure
[42:44.110 --> 42:45.450]  it and see how big it gets.
[42:46.150 --> 42:48.050]  Yeah. Measure the size. Treat it like a science
[42:48.050 --> 42:49.990]  experiment. Yeah, we'll get the resources
[42:49.990 --> 42:52.070]  when we're measuring heads, and I can just apply
[42:52.070 --> 42:53.450]  it to the bottom. There you go.
[42:53.970 --> 42:55.230]  Two in one. That's a great idea.
[42:56.170 --> 42:58.070]  Yeah. Flawless. Are you guys
[42:59.350 --> 43:00.030]  still playing
[43:00.030 --> 43:01.970]  Cyberpunk? I am.
[43:02.130 --> 43:03.670]  Thank you so much for bringing that up.
[43:03.790 --> 43:05.550]  I have a question for two of you. Okay.
[43:06.930 --> 43:07.910]  This is the
[43:07.910 --> 43:10.010]  number one thing... I mean, not the number one
[43:10.010 --> 43:12.070]  thing. My game is completely broken. I can't
[43:12.070 --> 43:14.010]  progress through the story because one of
[43:14.010 --> 43:16.010]  the main missions is bugged. But this drives
[43:16.010 --> 43:18.030]  me crazy. I haven't heard anyone else
[43:18.030 --> 43:20.090]  talk about this. So every
[43:20.090 --> 43:22.150]  time you do a mission, they give you a chip,
[43:22.290 --> 43:23.990]  right? And then you're like, yeah, I'm gonna
[43:23.990 --> 43:25.750]  see what's up with this. And you put it in your head.
[43:26.350 --> 43:28.090]  I have yet to pull a fucking chip
[43:28.090 --> 43:30.130]  out of my head. How many slots does
[43:30.130 --> 43:32.130]  this guy have? Is the whole side
[43:32.130 --> 43:34.050]  of his head ports? Well, surely he's pulling
[43:34.050 --> 43:35.930]  out when the thing ends.
[43:36.730 --> 43:38.070]  You never see that though.
[43:38.270 --> 43:39.870]  Well, if you pulled something
[43:39.870 --> 43:41.530]  out of the side of your head,
[43:41.970 --> 43:43.330]  would you need to look at it?
[43:44.070 --> 43:45.910]  No, but I see it peripherally the entire way.
[43:46.130 --> 43:47.510]  I see it peripherally going in.
[43:47.510 --> 43:48.970]  I don't see it peripherally go up.
[43:49.070 --> 43:51.850]  If I'm reaching around the back of my dumb iMac
[43:51.850 --> 43:53.290]  and I'm trying to put in an SD card,
[43:54.090 --> 43:55.850]  I'm looking at the SD card. I'm trying to
[43:55.850 --> 43:57.970]  figure out the right way I'm putting it in. When I take
[43:57.970 --> 43:59.890]  it out, I reach blindly behind it
[43:59.890 --> 44:01.370]  and I pull it out. I don't look at it.
[44:02.330 --> 44:03.850]  No, it doesn't. If you, Eric,
[44:03.850 --> 44:05.930]  pulls up a clip in the game, you're putting
[44:05.930 --> 44:07.870]  it in, you put it in and then you put your hand down
[44:07.870 --> 44:09.330]  immediately. There's no extracting.
[44:09.630 --> 44:12.010]  I have like 89 fucking chips
[44:12.010 --> 44:13.750]  in my head. Can't we just assume that it
[44:14.330 --> 44:15.910]  can't we just assume that it happens
[44:15.910 --> 44:17.990]  off camera? Like, you also have an apartment
[44:17.990 --> 44:19.970]  with a bathroom, but you don't
[44:19.970 --> 44:21.890]  take a shit. We just
[44:21.890 --> 44:22.870]  assume that it happens.
[44:23.610 --> 44:25.770]  But, I don't know, I feel like it's weird because they
[44:25.770 --> 44:27.930]  establish you can pull it out. There are scenes where
[44:27.930 --> 44:29.970]  you're pulling stuff in and out, at least with one
[44:29.970 --> 44:31.930]  chip. So it's just odd to me that
[44:31.930 --> 44:34.250]  there's no animation of you extracting
[44:34.250 --> 44:36.150]  it in any way. It's just there.
[44:36.490 --> 44:37.890]  Maybe the way it works is
[44:37.890 --> 44:39.770]  you feed it in, kind of like a dot matrix
[44:39.770 --> 44:42.030]  and then as it's being used, it goes through your
[44:42.030 --> 44:43.270]  head and then it poops out the back.
[44:44.850 --> 44:46.370]  It just goes into your pocket.
[44:46.970 --> 44:47.170]  Yeah.
[44:48.150 --> 44:50.090]  I don't think that's
[44:50.090 --> 44:51.970]  true. I'd love to know if somebody
[44:51.970 --> 44:54.110]  I'm sure somebody will. Someone needs to make
[44:54.110 --> 44:56.070]  a video of all the times you put chips
[44:56.070 --> 44:58.150]  in your head and then find out how many chips
[44:58.150 --> 45:00.010]  you would have at the end of the game. In your head.
[45:00.010 --> 45:01.130]  I bet you it's hundreds.
[45:01.770 --> 45:03.050]  Oh, it has to be for sure.
[45:03.710 --> 45:05.850]  I'm enjoying the game. I love the game.
[45:06.430 --> 45:07.990]  It's so... here's my problem
[45:07.990 --> 45:09.830]  with it. I don't sleep well anymore.
[45:10.250 --> 45:11.930]  Because I'm playing... I can't stop
[45:11.930 --> 45:13.690]  playing. I like...
[45:13.690 --> 45:15.910]  I one more minute it or like turn
[45:15.910 --> 45:17.970]  in one more mission it until it's like
[45:17.970 --> 45:19.850]  fucking three or four in the morning. I've been
[45:19.850 --> 45:21.870]  I had worked out a schedule. I've been going to bed
[45:21.870 --> 45:23.810]  like 11 o'clock every night waking up like
[45:23.810 --> 45:25.550]  super refreshed at 7 a.m.
[45:25.890 --> 45:27.930]  Now I'm playing goddamn cyberpunk till three
[45:27.930 --> 45:29.490]  or four in the morning waking up at eight.
[45:29.690 --> 45:31.570]  Wanting to murder everybody.
[45:32.190 --> 45:32.710]  It sucks.
[45:34.050 --> 45:35.950]  And I realize that's what
[45:35.950 --> 45:37.890]  it was always like my entire life
[45:37.890 --> 45:39.470]  because of video games and drinking and stuff.
[45:39.850 --> 45:41.790]  I'd never had good sleep until
[45:41.790 --> 45:43.730]  this last couple years
[45:43.730 --> 45:45.550]  and I really have grown to like it.
[45:46.210 --> 45:47.210]  Fucking I hate.
[45:47.950 --> 45:49.870]  I wish I wasn't so addicted to this game.
[45:50.370 --> 45:51.950]  I'm sort of the same way because I don't
[45:51.950 --> 45:54.190]  find a ton of time in the day time
[45:54.190 --> 45:56.010]  when it's probably the most
[45:56.010 --> 45:57.230]  appropriate time to play. So I
[45:57.870 --> 45:59.830]  sometimes start playing at like 11 p.m.
[45:59.870 --> 46:01.590]  and then it's 1 and I'm like
[46:01.590 --> 46:03.270]  oh man I stayed up late.
[46:03.890 --> 46:05.870]  It is also a buggy broken game
[46:05.870 --> 46:07.430]  but it's so much fun it doesn't matter.
[46:07.770 --> 46:09.830]  A lot of bugs are funny
[46:09.830 --> 46:11.270]  and a lot of the other ones
[46:11.270 --> 46:13.590]  I've not reached a game breaking bug yet.
[46:13.710 --> 46:15.870]  I've reached some immersion
[46:15.870 --> 46:17.510]  breaking bugs but
[46:17.510 --> 46:19.810]  nothing that's ruined the experience
[46:19.810 --> 46:21.910]  for me yet. I've been handed a lot of
[46:21.910 --> 46:22.810]  stuff that's invisible.
[46:22.810 --> 46:24.890]  I very
[46:24.890 --> 46:26.790]  often cannot get on my motorcycle
[46:26.790 --> 46:28.470]  I just don't get a prompt for it.
[46:28.550 --> 46:30.790]  And if I kick it or punch it
[46:30.790 --> 46:32.510]  I'll be able to. Just dumb shit like that.
[46:32.590 --> 46:34.370]  I see a lot of guns floating in the air.
[46:34.770 --> 46:36.590]  A lot of floating guns. A lot of floating data pads.
[46:36.710 --> 46:38.910]  But I am playing on PC where
[46:38.910 --> 46:41.010]  I guess it's way less buggy than
[46:41.490 --> 46:42.670]  last gen consoles.
[46:43.830 --> 46:44.650]  Are you close to
[46:44.650 --> 46:45.170]  beating it?
[46:46.490 --> 46:48.610]  I don't know. Do you know how the
[46:48.610 --> 46:50.490]  story progression works? Because there's like the three
[46:50.490 --> 46:51.970]  the three bars
[46:51.970 --> 46:54.550]  on the start screen
[46:54.550 --> 46:55.890]  and it has like the one
[46:56.610 --> 46:58.550]  I'm at 90, 20
[46:58.550 --> 46:59.390]  and 40.
[47:00.350 --> 47:02.430]  I'm at like
[47:03.190 --> 47:04.030]  25 and
[47:04.930 --> 47:05.790]  4 or something.
[47:06.010 --> 47:08.310]  I don't think the left one is story related.
[47:08.510 --> 47:10.230]  It's like notoriety or something like that.
[47:10.350 --> 47:12.310]  It's your rep, I think, in the world. I don't know.
[47:12.490 --> 47:13.870]  I was confused about that too.
[47:14.090 --> 47:16.510]  I'm at a point where I had to pick
[47:16.510 --> 47:17.610]  up a mission to go
[47:18.490 --> 47:19.570]  to see Hanaka
[47:19.570 --> 47:21.530]  and it was like, I went to start it
[47:21.530 --> 47:23.450]  and it said, just so you know, if you start this mission
[47:23.450 --> 47:25.470]  you can't come back to the rest of the game until the game is over.
[47:25.610 --> 47:26.230]  So I backed out.
[47:27.830 --> 47:30.030]  This is probably boring as fuck for our podcast.
[47:30.250 --> 47:31.390]  I'm like level 20 or something.
[47:32.590 --> 47:33.290]  What about you, Gavin?
[47:34.050 --> 47:34.370]  12.
[47:36.170 --> 47:37.690]  I haven't had too many great
[47:37.690 --> 47:39.510]  bugs. I think the best bug
[47:39.510 --> 47:41.410]  that has happened to me is I summoned my car
[47:41.410 --> 47:43.450]  and it drove up the street to my right
[47:43.450 --> 47:44.870]  and I was like, great, I'm going to get in it.
[47:44.870 --> 47:47.210]  And instead of turning left to me, it took a right
[47:47.210 --> 47:49.050]  and then just started driving down the highway.
[47:49.250 --> 47:50.510]  It was just leaving without me.
[47:50.870 --> 47:52.430]  It became, like, fully automated.
[47:52.950 --> 47:54.830]  Have you ever summoned your... oh, I have a motorcycle
[47:54.830 --> 47:56.550]  but have you ever summoned your car and had it hit you?
[47:57.050 --> 47:58.950]  No. That happens to me all the time.
[47:59.010 --> 48:00.770]  It's fucking hilarious. I get run over
[48:00.770 --> 48:01.470]  by my own car.
[48:03.410 --> 48:04.710]  What do you think would happen
[48:04.710 --> 48:06.830]  if you put
[48:06.830 --> 48:08.670]  on a glove, like a safety glove,
[48:08.730 --> 48:10.730]  or like an oven mitt, put on an oven mitt, right,
[48:10.790 --> 48:12.850]  because that'll protect your hand, and you go in
[48:12.850 --> 48:14.110]  to your bathroom
[48:14.830 --> 48:16.350]  and you shake that bottle.
[48:18.990 --> 48:20.390]  Why do I need an oven mitt for it?
[48:20.470 --> 48:21.630]  To protect your hand from shrapnel.
[48:21.630 --> 48:22.470]  Yeah, if it explodes.
[48:23.770 --> 48:25.190]  Your hand is ground zero.
[48:25.910 --> 48:28.650]  But would an oven mitt, is an oven mitt providing that?
[48:28.670 --> 48:30.470]  Well, yeah, if the plastic is sharp enough
[48:30.470 --> 48:32.710]  as it whooshes by your hand skin,
[48:32.770 --> 48:33.370]  it could cut you.
[48:33.790 --> 48:36.290]  You'd get like a paper cut, but the oven mitt will protect the hell out of you.
[48:36.510 --> 48:38.730]  I don't have an oven mitt. I mean, I have a sock.
[48:38.930 --> 48:40.770]  I still have a sock on my desk
[48:40.770 --> 48:41.850]  Sock would work.
[48:42.170 --> 48:44.210]  When we did the left sock thing.
[48:44.330 --> 48:45.130]  Okay, I got a sock.
[48:45.430 --> 48:47.030]  So you're gonna do a sock and shake?
[48:48.190 --> 48:49.650]  I guess I'll do a sock and shake.
[48:50.230 --> 48:51.290]  I guess is that what we're doing?
[48:52.210 --> 48:54.090]  I'm really taking one for the team this episode.
[48:54.550 --> 48:55.890]  I'm drinking shit coffee.
[48:56.490 --> 48:57.510]  I'm shaking stuff.
[48:58.430 --> 49:01.370]  Well, I feel like we're starting off 2021 right.
[49:01.470 --> 49:03.490]  It's the year of Andrew taking one for the team.
[49:03.750 --> 49:04.490]  And here we go.
[49:06.250 --> 49:06.650]  Okay.
[49:07.410 --> 49:08.750]  I guess I'll go do this.
[49:08.750 --> 49:09.370]  Every episode.
[49:10.170 --> 49:12.410]  Why don't you do it in front of the mic though?
[49:12.450 --> 49:13.310]  So we can have progress.
[49:13.430 --> 49:17.030]  So if it explodes, you want it to be in front of all the tech?
[49:17.570 --> 49:18.530]  Well, are we gonna hear it?
[49:18.570 --> 49:19.950]  Why even do it if we can't hear it?
[49:20.410 --> 49:22.490]  Well, why am I even doing it at all, Gavin?
[49:22.490 --> 49:23.670]  This is a horrible idea.
[49:23.710 --> 49:24.910]  Just put your sock on.
[49:25.710 --> 49:28.150]  It's already on. The sock's on, Geoff.
[49:28.230 --> 49:30.530]  It's just we're talking about the logistics of this.
[49:30.650 --> 49:31.310]  Can I ask a question?
[49:31.890 --> 49:32.390]  Yeah, go ahead.
[49:32.590 --> 49:34.390]  Was the sock on before I brought it up?
[49:34.390 --> 49:36.270]  I don't think we need to get into that.
[49:40.950 --> 49:44.130]  If you told me Andrew had two sock puppets on
[49:44.130 --> 49:45.450]  A Geoff and a Gavin sock puppet
[49:46.030 --> 49:48.030]  the entire time we record every podcast
[49:48.030 --> 49:49.330]  and he was just mouthing us
[49:50.210 --> 49:52.510]  Who did you think superfan Gus is?
[49:54.410 --> 49:55.750]  Andrew last time said that
[49:55.750 --> 49:58.110]  a lot of the visuals of this podcast would be him
[49:58.110 --> 50:00.330]  flinging his hands up in the air above his head
[50:00.330 --> 50:01.770]  in disbelief, and now I'm imagining
[50:01.770 --> 50:02.790]  just two socks
[50:04.290 --> 50:05.770]  Two socks coming up
[50:05.770 --> 50:06.470]  above his head
[50:06.470 --> 50:07.850]  with little button eyes
[50:11.030 --> 50:12.690]  I could bring it over but like
[50:12.690 --> 50:13.290]  what if it
[50:14.350 --> 50:15.430]  I need a cover
[50:16.870 --> 50:17.770]  I need a cover
[50:17.770 --> 50:20.590]  I'm gonna put it in a shirt and I'm gonna shake it
[50:20.590 --> 50:21.150]  That's what I'm gonna do
[50:26.890 --> 50:28.490]  What do you think Andrew's doing?
[50:29.390 --> 50:30.210]  I think he's
[50:30.210 --> 50:31.230]  trying to figure out
[50:32.110 --> 50:34.350]  I don't think he's taking the socks off
[50:34.350 --> 50:35.430]  to wrap it in the shirt
[50:35.430 --> 50:37.290]  and I think he's trying to cut corners
[50:37.290 --> 50:38.950]  he really should take the socks off
[50:39.610 --> 50:41.590]  prepare the ball and then put them back on
[50:41.590 --> 50:44.130]  but I think he's trying to fumble his way
[50:45.210 --> 50:45.790]  What do you mean?
[50:46.210 --> 50:46.430]  What?
[50:47.770 --> 50:49.270]  Were you gonna wrap it in a shirt?
[50:50.050 --> 50:51.390]  Yeah, so what are you saying?
[50:51.650 --> 50:52.170]  What should I do?
[50:53.210 --> 50:55.130]  I'm not saying you should do it, you should just do what you're doing
[50:56.290 --> 50:57.430]  Well then what are you talking about?
[50:57.690 --> 50:59.450]  Talk us through it, well we couldn't hear you
[50:59.450 --> 51:01.350]  so we were trying to figure out what you were talking about
[51:01.350 --> 51:02.210]  I was imagining what was happening
[51:02.210 --> 51:04.010]  So I grab the shirt
[51:04.770 --> 51:06.310]  This is not good
[51:06.310 --> 51:09.410]  This feels really bad
[51:09.410 --> 51:10.930]  Nick has written in the chat
[51:10.930 --> 51:12.690]  If the bottle survives
[51:13.210 --> 51:15.410]  Do you think he has the waffle maker nearby?
[51:15.650 --> 51:17.030]  Could he try and cook the stuff?
[51:17.550 --> 51:18.310]  I'll tell you what Andrew
[51:18.310 --> 51:20.930]  We should try that as an alternate
[51:20.930 --> 51:22.870]  and I'll pay for the electric cost
[51:23.370 --> 51:23.850]  What?
[51:24.250 --> 51:25.350]  For that waffle, don't worry
[51:25.350 --> 51:27.050]  What's the worst that could happen?
[51:27.050 --> 51:28.510]  I don't think anything is going to happen
[51:29.040 --> 51:32.270]  I think it exploding and then me vomiting
[51:32.270 --> 51:33.590]  because it's going to smell so bad
[51:33.590 --> 51:34.930]  It feels so full
[51:34.930 --> 51:37.650]  I can't even grip it with the sock
[51:39.150 --> 51:41.470]  Okay, so let's tie a knot I guess
[51:41.970 --> 51:44.810]  What did you tie a knot in?
[51:45.430 --> 51:45.970]  I don't know
[51:45.970 --> 51:47.630]  My hand, I'm wrapping my hand
[51:47.630 --> 51:49.010]  I'll take a photo
[51:49.930 --> 51:50.830]  Please take a photo
[51:50.830 --> 51:51.650]  What?
[51:52.250 --> 51:55.010]  Please, these will all, as with all photos
[51:55.010 --> 51:55.870]  from this website
[51:55.870 --> 51:57.450]  I mean, what? This podcast
[51:59.270 --> 52:00.930]  As with all photos from this podcast
[52:00.930 --> 52:02.830]  They appear on our Instagram
[52:02.830 --> 52:05.270]  This is my hand right now
[52:05.270 --> 52:06.290]  What is that?
[52:06.850 --> 52:09.250]  That's my hand wrapped in a shirt with a bottle
[52:09.250 --> 52:10.950]  You can see the bottle outline at the top
[52:12.370 --> 52:13.650]  This is very alarming
[52:13.650 --> 52:15.310]  Is that an action photo?
[52:15.450 --> 52:16.650]  I love the blurs
[52:16.650 --> 52:19.010]  Because I have a shit phone
[52:19.010 --> 52:20.210]  Because I broke my phone
[52:20.210 --> 52:22.950]  So I bought an old, broken, shitty phone
[52:22.950 --> 52:24.670]  What do you want from me?
[52:25.490 --> 52:27.630]  You're fucking whining about the blurriness
[52:27.630 --> 52:29.790]  And I'm holding a waffle bomb in my hand
[52:29.790 --> 52:30.350]  So fuck
[52:30.350 --> 52:31.950]  I got a waffle bomb
[52:32.770 --> 52:34.450]  Fucking worried about the blurriness
[52:34.450 --> 52:35.290]  You asshole
[52:35.290 --> 52:36.930]  I got a waffle bomb
[52:38.310 --> 52:39.330]  What do you want?
[52:40.510 --> 52:43.250]  I'm scared to shake it, it feels so full
[52:44.550 --> 52:45.890]  Do I just shake it?
[52:46.690 --> 52:48.790]  You gotta shake it vigorously, like it's a shake wave
[52:48.790 --> 52:49.730]  I know, yep
[52:50.730 --> 52:52.010]  It's gonna explode
[52:52.710 --> 52:53.190]  It's gonna explode
[52:53.190 --> 52:55.190]  It's not gonna explode
[52:55.730 --> 52:57.630]  It's gonna explode
[52:57.630 --> 53:00.230]  Are you shaking it now or are you just looking at it?
[53:00.370 --> 53:00.690]  No, no, no
[53:00.690 --> 53:04.070]  I'm holding it like it's a grenade
[53:04.070 --> 53:05.150]  That the pin is out of
[53:05.150 --> 53:07.170]  And as soon as I release it, it's gonna explode
[53:07.170 --> 53:08.810]  I'm very nervous about this
[53:08.810 --> 53:11.890]  It's in the safety shirt, you're fine
[53:11.890 --> 53:12.470]  Fuck
[53:12.470 --> 53:14.190]  It totally is
[53:14.190 --> 53:16.270]  What if I lose my fucking hand?
[53:16.270 --> 53:18.130]  What if the bottle takes my hand off?
[53:18.630 --> 53:19.750]  You got a high volume
[53:19.750 --> 53:22.290]  You got a sock on, you'll be fine
[53:24.030 --> 53:25.930]  The sock will collect all the bits
[53:26.490 --> 53:28.670]  Honestly, I'm gonna take another photo
[53:28.670 --> 53:29.930]  Cause I like rewrapped it
[53:29.930 --> 53:31.150]  This is like a cast
[53:31.150 --> 53:32.590]  This is so good
[53:33.490 --> 53:34.830]  You're right, this is so good
[53:35.310 --> 53:37.710]  This is restoring my faith in this podcast
[53:38.210 --> 53:40.010]  After the last two, I was like
[53:40.010 --> 53:41.910]  We were all fucking high-fiving
[53:41.910 --> 53:43.550]  How well the first 30 went
[53:43.550 --> 53:45.330]  And how many people were listening to it
[53:45.330 --> 53:46.730]  And then we made these last two
[53:47.690 --> 53:49.790]  You think every episode sucks
[53:49.790 --> 53:52.570]  The one before this was the weirdest episode ever
[53:52.570 --> 53:53.930]  No, you've always seen it
[53:53.930 --> 53:55.010]  What was the one before that?
[53:55.170 --> 53:56.630]  Oh, you're counting this one as these two
[53:57.070 --> 53:58.370]  Yeah, these two, this one
[53:58.370 --> 53:59.790]  Yeah, have you been here for this podcast?
[54:00.410 --> 54:02.310]  Look at how secure that is
[54:02.310 --> 54:03.790]  It is so wrapped
[54:03.790 --> 54:05.710]  I could knock somebody out with this
[54:05.710 --> 54:08.270]  I just shook it, I did a fist thing
[54:08.270 --> 54:11.210]  Why are you bothering with the socks now?
[54:11.210 --> 54:13.130]  Why don't you just grab that and shake it?
[54:14.050 --> 54:16.410]  Because you told me to put the fucking sock on
[54:16.410 --> 54:18.050]  I thought you were just shaking it
[54:18.050 --> 54:19.030]  Now you're wrapped in a shirt
[54:19.030 --> 54:21.390]  Take your hands out of the socks, grab the shirt, shake that
[54:21.390 --> 54:23.230]  No, the sock, it listened
[54:23.230 --> 54:24.490]  Oh, I grabbed the shirt
[54:24.490 --> 54:25.390]  Oh, I see
[54:25.870 --> 54:28.090]  Don't listen to Gavin
[54:28.090 --> 54:30.030]  If it blows up
[54:30.030 --> 54:32.910]  And it blows your fingers off
[54:32.910 --> 54:34.610]  The sock will hold them in
[54:35.050 --> 54:36.410]  So the doctors can reattach them
[54:36.410 --> 54:37.430]  I think the socks are okay
[54:37.430 --> 54:38.910]  It's gonna collect all your gubbins
[54:39.550 --> 54:39.950]  Okay
[54:40.730 --> 54:41.790]  Okay, here we go
[54:42.490 --> 54:43.190]  Oh boy
[54:46.510 --> 54:47.310]  Oh god
[54:49.470 --> 54:50.970]  He's really going for it
[54:50.970 --> 54:52.570]  I did, what do you mean?
[54:52.650 --> 54:54.950]  You fucking told me to shake it, I don't think anything's happening
[54:56.210 --> 54:57.210]  I'm gonna look at it
[54:57.710 --> 54:58.990]  I'm extracting the bomb
[54:59.950 --> 55:01.150]  I think it was diffused
[55:02.490 --> 55:03.870]  This is really hard to get out
[55:05.030 --> 55:06.150]  I'm gonna drop the bottle
[55:08.230 --> 55:09.250]  Don't drop the bottle
[55:10.890 --> 55:11.370]  Don't drop the bottle
[55:11.870 --> 55:12.910]  Bottles coming out
[55:13.810 --> 55:14.590]  No it's not
[55:14.590 --> 55:17.330]  Okay, here we go
[55:27.510 --> 55:29.710]  I feel like it's getting fuller
[55:29.710 --> 55:33.230]  I would pay a million dollars to hear an explosion right now
[55:35.470 --> 55:36.690]  It's out of the shirt
[55:36.690 --> 55:37.930]  That'd be very dangerous
[55:37.930 --> 55:39.190]  I'm covering my eyes
[55:41.370 --> 55:42.530]  How's it look?
[55:43.850 --> 55:45.970]  Can you peep through your fingers to look at it?
[55:46.150 --> 55:46.230]  Yeah
[55:47.210 --> 55:50.970]  Honestly, it feels way more full than it did before
[55:50.970 --> 55:52.210]  I don't like this at all
[55:53.110 --> 55:53.810]  What if I
[55:53.810 --> 55:55.170]  Are you gonna keep shaking?
[55:56.450 --> 55:57.910]  If I open it, will it explode?
[55:58.670 --> 55:59.870]  No, that would lose the pressure
[55:59.870 --> 56:00.770]  You don't want to do that
[56:01.850 --> 56:04.450]  I'm willing to open it for the sound of it opening
[56:04.450 --> 56:05.590]  But will it?
[56:06.230 --> 56:07.150]  Okay, you know what?
[56:07.290 --> 56:09.250]  One of two things is gonna happen
[56:09.710 --> 56:11.090]  We're either gonna set it aside
[56:11.090 --> 56:13.070]  And then wait for it to explode
[56:13.070 --> 56:15.110]  And have you document the damage
[56:16.030 --> 56:19.130]  Or we can open it right now
[56:19.130 --> 56:21.270]  And then you can describe the smell
[56:22.930 --> 56:23.330]  Okay
[56:23.330 --> 56:25.210]  I'm gonna open it in the shirt
[56:25.210 --> 56:26.570]  I don't think it was ever gonna explode
[56:26.570 --> 56:29.130]  I think the top was gonna blow off, if anything
[56:29.950 --> 56:31.230]  That's kind of an explosion
[56:31.230 --> 56:32.130]  Yeah?
[56:32.370 --> 56:34.310]  The top is very inflated
[56:34.310 --> 56:36.330]  Okay, so I'm gonna open this in the shirt
[56:37.650 --> 56:39.710]  I'm scared to even fuckin' open this
[56:39.710 --> 56:41.130]  Pour some in your coffee
[56:43.610 --> 56:44.730]  Oh boy
[56:44.730 --> 56:46.190]  I hope we can hear the hiss
[56:46.790 --> 56:47.350]  Oh!
[56:48.210 --> 56:50.310]  The fuckin' smoke shot out!
[56:50.770 --> 56:52.510]  Smoke shot out through the shirt!
[56:52.810 --> 56:54.370]  What the fuck was that?
[56:54.450 --> 56:55.150]  Was that batter?
[56:55.710 --> 56:56.850]  What was that?
[56:56.850 --> 56:58.190]  Am I dead?
[56:58.970 --> 57:00.370]  Is this like a trap?
[57:00.630 --> 57:01.670]  Did I just poison myself?
[57:02.870 --> 57:04.850]  Am I gonna turn into the fuckin' alien
[57:04.850 --> 57:05.970]  From District 9?
[57:06.550 --> 57:07.730]  There was smoke
[57:09.010 --> 57:11.550]  Oh god, we still haven't cracked the seal
[57:11.550 --> 57:12.850]  I think that was just peripheral
[57:12.850 --> 57:14.610]  Like mix on the inner lid
[57:14.610 --> 57:15.950]  It shot out!
[57:18.330 --> 57:19.470]  It's been released
[57:20.790 --> 57:22.010]  It's been released, yeah
[57:22.010 --> 57:24.430]  It was like the fuckin' tomb opening in the mummy
[57:24.430 --> 57:26.290]  Yeah, I was about to say, this is the plot of the mummy
[57:27.490 --> 57:28.690]  Okay, we're gonna smell it
[57:29.730 --> 57:30.370]  Oh god
[57:30.970 --> 57:32.210]  God, I hope you're Brendan Fraser
[57:39.710 --> 57:40.770]  It's so bad
[57:42.310 --> 57:43.330]  It's so bad
[57:44.270 --> 57:44.850]  Another one
[58:07.400 --> 58:09.560]  Oh god
[58:18.120 --> 58:26.160]  I can't breathe, Gavin
[58:28.420 --> 58:30.340]  My stomach hurts
[58:30.340 --> 58:32.220]  My stomach hurts too
[58:32.220 --> 58:34.260]  I can't breathe
[58:34.260 --> 58:37.400]  I can't catch my breath
[58:37.400 --> 58:43.980]  Oh, it's extra funny when the discord
[58:43.980 --> 58:45.500]  Like cuts it out slightly
[58:46.030 --> 58:46.960]  I know
[58:47.780 --> 58:49.460]  Oh god damn
[58:49.460 --> 58:53.900]  That was like a dangerous laugh
[58:53.900 --> 58:56.920]  Oh man, if that had been like 3% funnier
[58:56.920 --> 58:57.920]  I might not have been able to breathe
[58:58.560 --> 58:59.820]  I could've died
[58:59.820 --> 59:01.420]  Oh Jesus
[59:01.420 --> 59:03.820]  I think I have a perfume idea, guys
[59:06.240 --> 59:07.260]  I gotta say
[59:08.060 --> 59:09.460]  Geoff, I'm gonna mail it to you
[59:09.460 --> 59:11.500]  How bad was that? Like 1 to 10
[59:11.500 --> 59:12.880]  10 being the worst ever
[59:14.120 --> 59:14.920]  Well, it's
[59:14.920 --> 59:16.060]  That was bad
[59:17.680 --> 59:18.800]  That was like an 8
[59:19.440 --> 59:20.640]  Can you still smell it?
[59:20.880 --> 59:21.540]  What'd you do with the bottle?
[59:22.640 --> 59:25.420]  It's still on my desk, I just put a lid on it, I capped the demon
[59:26.420 --> 59:27.100]  It's bad
[59:27.800 --> 59:29.440]  What would you describe the smell?
[59:30.560 --> 59:31.360]  Just like
[59:31.940 --> 59:33.500]  Spoiled milk, I guess
[59:33.500 --> 59:34.920]  It was a very milky
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.220]  Was there milk in there?
[59:39.260 --> 59:41.120]  No, there was no milk in there
[59:41.120 --> 59:42.280]  Oh god
[59:43.520 --> 59:45.440]  I think if I took another whiff
[59:47.720 --> 59:49.240]  I'm impressed Gavin didn't throw up
[59:49.240 --> 59:52.420]  He's got such a mincey little stomach
[59:52.420 --> 59:53.680]  You wanted to know what it smelled like?
[59:53.720 --> 59:54.560]  Let me take another whiff
[59:56.120 --> 59:57.340]  Please do, thank you
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.140]  It smells
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.020]  Ugh
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.620]  Stop it
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:08.940]  I'm done
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.640]  It smells like
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.260]  Milk and paint
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.200]  How much did you drink it?
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:18.580]  Milk and paint
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.720]  No, I'm not drinking it
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.700]  I don't want you to drink it, that'd be dangerous
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.480]  I want you to taste it
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.220]  You don't have to ingest it, I just want you to put a little on your tongue
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.700]  No, I fucking opened a waffle bomb
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.280]  for you
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.340]  You drink so weird shit
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.440]  I'm drinking a diet Dr. Pepper
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.700]  You know what, I'll save this for you Geoff
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.000]  And I'll send it to you
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.820]  You can have a sip
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.120]  I don't think it's legal
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.220]  You might get in trouble for sending that
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.240]  cross country
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.340]  Just a little on the tip of your tongue
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.180]  Just a little drop
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.060]  No, I didn't
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.340]  I fucking opened a bomb
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.260]  I drank bullshit coffee
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.660]  I'm good
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.500]  I think Eric wants us to stop anyway
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.200]  Oh god
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.960]  I feel like I got an ab workout
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.940]  I'm ready to warm him up
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.560]  Jesus Christ
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.000]  Was that one of the less weird?
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.280]  We're on a tear of weird episodes
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.140]  Wait, where did he go?
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:21.940]  He left
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.740]  Did he leave the
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:24.580]  Is that it?
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.680]  What the fuck
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.640]  Geoff, wrap it up
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.280]  But I'm still
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.400]  The fake me is still
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.240]  The fake you is still there
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.380]  He hung up the wrong one
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.180]  He didn't realize
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.940]  Alright, well that seems like
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.800]  We should probably check on him
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880]  Oh by the way
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.120]  This is I think the last podcast I'll record in my bedroom
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:49.920]  As of
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.720]  Let's not get ahead of ourselves
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.980]  As of today
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.080]  Contractor left today
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.460]  I was before I came in here
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.640]  I was even painting the ceiling
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.180]  I'm almost done
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.880]  They already un-wallpapered and stuff
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.780]  Andrew, where'd you go?
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.100]  I got all that sorted out
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.480]  I mean I'm dying over here
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.000]  I'm gonna leave
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.740]  Before I left I just had to once again give a shout out and a thanks to Superfang Gus
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:14.920]  That's all
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.060]  That's all
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.380]  Well there you have it
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.720]  He's gone again
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.340]  Alright, let's
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.060]  2021 off to a weird start
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.040]  Let's just wrap it
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.460]  Alright, thanks for listening to another episode of F***face
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.540]  If you did
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.760]  You have my sympathy
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.260]  We done yet?
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.520]  Why'd you keep leaving?
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.320]  End the f***ing episode
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.720]  Jesus Christ, how long is it gonna take?
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.940]  I'm dying over here
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.800]  We'll do the outro and we'll go
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.700]  You do the outro
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.960]  I'm doing f***ing everything
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.900]  You keep interrupting me doing the outro
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.800]  Okay, we'll do the outro then
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.200]  Thanks for listening to another episode of F***face
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.400]  I hope you enjoyed it, but I doubt it
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.520]  Hey, check it out, it's 2021
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.780]  We're off to the races
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.460]  I wish I could say it's gonna get better from here
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.880]  But at best
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.860]  I think it's just gonna get weirder
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.980]  But tune in to find out next week
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.780]  Or don't, whatever
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.600]  I'm not your dad
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.280]  As far as I know
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.460]  I'm certainly not your boss
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.980]  So I can't force you to listen if you don't want to
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.440]  This is America, it's a free country
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.580]  Probably a free country wherever you're living too
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.140]  I don't presuppose that everyone that listens
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.640]  Andrew is right, this is too long
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.560]  I don't know how this isn't wrapping up
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.700]  I'm trying to end it right now, people keep interrupting me
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.100]  Anyway, so like us and subscribe
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.580]  Five stars on the Apple
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.060]  And hey, we really appreciate it
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:37.980]  Don't forget
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.520]  F*** face pod
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.120]  Is the name of our Instagram
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.960]  Where we put pictures of all this stuff up
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.960]  I believe we have a Twitter too
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.000]  And oh, merchandise
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.280]  Let's not forget about the f*** face merchandise
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.860]  That's coming your way January 8th
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.080]  What day is this?
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.300]  Do we know, Eric?
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.280]  I think this is the 6th
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.320]  This January 6th in just two days
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.460]  You just had Christmas
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.100]  You thought that was fun and now you're broke
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.340]  But don't be broke
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.060]  Sell or sell something
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:07.940]  Of your grandma's
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.100]  To get a little bit more money
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.380]  Because Chris Manuary is out
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.220]  It's the new holiday
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.560]  It's the new holiday
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.940]  That starts in January
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.980]  You don't want to wait a whole other year to buy presents for people
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.860]  Or to get presents
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.600]  So we started a new holiday, Chris Manuary
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.720]  Where you can buy three
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.560]  Different f*** face items
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.800]  They make great stocking stuffers
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.640]  For your Chris Manuary stocking
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.700]  We got a baseball bat
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.720]  We got a Russian mistake hat
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.040]  And we got an Ian pocket tee
[01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:38.820]  So check those out in two days
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.460]  And as always, thanks for listening
