[00:46.110 --> 00:48.050]  And f***face. Congratulations.
[00:48.650 --> 00:51.110]  Welcome to f***face. You've survived the year 2020.
[00:51.650 --> 00:57.730]  Just for posterity's sake, we are recording this episode on January 7th
[00:57.730 --> 01:03.470]  in what has already turned out to be the most uneventful and boring week in history.
[01:03.810 --> 01:05.930]  Nothing going on in the world, certainly not in America.
[01:05.930 --> 01:07.930]  But over the holiday break...
[01:08.510 --> 01:09.710]  What the f***, Nick?
[01:11.690 --> 01:12.170]  What?
[01:12.790 --> 01:13.910]  You had a baby?
[01:14.470 --> 01:14.730]  Yeah.
[01:14.930 --> 01:16.290]  You didn't tell us you were pregnant!
[01:16.670 --> 01:17.310]  I thought I did.
[01:17.610 --> 01:17.810]  No!
[01:18.690 --> 01:19.650]  Aw, congrats.
[01:19.890 --> 01:20.470]  Thank you.
[01:21.050 --> 01:22.130]  That's so cool.
[01:22.330 --> 01:24.950]  Yeah, congratulations. Give us the deets. What are the stats?
[01:25.250 --> 01:27.910]  Oh, he's good. He's two weeks old now.
[01:28.170 --> 01:32.110]  And he's real cute. He's almost sleeping through the night sometimes.
[01:32.890 --> 01:34.150]  Did you name him Geoff?
[01:34.150 --> 01:35.890]  No, his name is Arthur.
[01:36.270 --> 01:37.890]  Missed opportunity. Arthur's a good name, though.
[01:37.990 --> 01:38.510]  Good name.
[01:38.630 --> 01:39.510]  The original, not the remake.
[01:39.610 --> 01:44.030]  My wife wanted to name him Gavin, but I was like, I work with a Gavin. That might be weird.
[01:45.190 --> 01:50.950]  Well, dude, in all seriousness, congratulations. I totally was caught off guard when that was announced.
[01:51.310 --> 01:58.030]  I'm so glad that I'm not the only one, because I realize Nick is probably the person I like the most but know the least about,
[01:58.270 --> 01:59.610]  because I didn't even know he had a wife.
[01:59.610 --> 02:07.730]  So that was like... there was a four-day stretch of like, Nick has a wife? Good for Nick. That's great. I didn't know that. That's crazy.
[02:07.910 --> 02:13.610]  And then finding out four days later that you had a kid. It was like, oh shit, and she's pregnant? And he has a kid?
[02:13.830 --> 02:15.810]  I know nothing about Nick, apparently.
[02:16.030 --> 02:17.370]  A vinful year for Nick, apparently.
[02:17.570 --> 02:17.890]  Wait.
[02:18.070 --> 02:19.230]  Why do you like him so much?
[02:19.430 --> 02:21.850]  Yeah, why is Nick your favorite? What's that?
[02:22.070 --> 02:24.890]  Nick's a great guy, and Nick may or may not have audio.
[02:24.890 --> 02:31.190]  I don't know what he has, what he doesn't have, so I'm definitely not playing to potential blackmail.
[02:31.670 --> 02:33.950]  But Nick's great. That's all I'll say. Great guy.
[02:34.230 --> 02:36.850]  You always kiss the ass of the editor. You have to.
[02:37.210 --> 02:38.090]  What happened, Andrew?
[02:38.470 --> 02:43.830]  What happened was... so I have all those Discord accounts, and we're on break. We had a two-week break.
[02:44.230 --> 02:48.170]  And I was like, I got nothing going on, so I'm just gonna sign in... I don't even remember who I signed in as.
[02:48.170 --> 02:49.870]  I think I signed in as my Eric account.
[02:50.310 --> 02:54.950]  And then I joined the chat, and then I said, like, uh, why are you here, in reference to me,
[02:55.230 --> 02:58.730]  thinking people might get notifications and show up and that something might happen?
[02:59.110 --> 03:01.950]  And then nothing really did. Gavin joined and said... he was confused.
[03:02.090 --> 03:03.170]  Said Happy New Year and left.
[03:03.430 --> 03:05.810]  It was on New Year's Eve, wasn't it? Or New Year's Day? When was it?
[03:05.930 --> 03:08.390]  Oh, it was last Thursday? Was that New Year's Eve?
[03:08.910 --> 03:09.610]  It may have been.
[03:10.130 --> 03:11.830]  Maybe the first day? I don't know. It doesn't matter.
[03:12.090 --> 03:15.590]  Anyway, I did that thing, and it was completely uneventful. Nothing happened.
[03:15.590 --> 03:20.910]  I closed out of Eric, but then I forgot to close out of my main account, and I was just in general,
[03:21.310 --> 03:23.950]  for like six hours without knowing it with my mic on.
[03:24.050 --> 03:28.910]  I put myself in a hot mic scenario, and I had a nap in that time.
[03:29.190 --> 03:35.230]  And I looked at my phone, and I saw there's a bot we use to record audio, and I saw a notification for it,
[03:35.450 --> 03:40.810]  that it was summoned, but I cleared the screen, and then when I checked Discord, that message was no longer there.
[03:40.810 --> 03:45.450]  So I was very paranoid. I thought, did I dream that? Like, I was kind of disoriented when I saw it.
[03:45.670 --> 03:48.910]  Maybe that didn't exist. So then I texted Gavin about it.
[03:49.150 --> 03:53.030]  He confirmed that he also got the alert, which then created a lot of paranoia.
[03:54.230 --> 04:00.530]  I kind of have an idea of what Nick may or may not have, but I don't know to what extent he has it.
[04:00.610 --> 04:04.530]  So Nick has like five hours of your bedroom?
[04:04.790 --> 04:08.050]  Just Andrew beating off horror for five hours.
[04:08.050 --> 04:11.310]  No, that's not in the audio. I don't have to worry about that.
[04:11.510 --> 04:14.810]  Some illicit drug deals going on, probably. Who knows?
[04:14.990 --> 04:18.650]  I'm guessing Nick has shared the audio with you based on what you just said. This is very concerning.
[04:20.250 --> 04:21.170]  Now I'm terrified.
[04:23.610 --> 04:28.750]  I can either confirm or deny the ownership of any such files.
[04:30.190 --> 04:34.430]  Nick, do you care to weigh in? Have you listened to all six hours of Andrew beating off and selling drugs?
[04:34.710 --> 04:37.010]  I'm only two hours in, but I'll let you know what I thought.
[04:38.050 --> 04:43.190]  It really picks up in the fourth hour. Stick with it. There's a good arc. It's coming.
[04:43.450 --> 04:47.910]  So we haven't talked in about two... I want to say... well, it sounds like you guys said hello to each other last week.
[04:47.970 --> 04:50.890]  But we haven't recorded in like two weeks, which...
[04:50.890 --> 04:51.470]  Almost three.
[04:51.630 --> 04:52.010]  Three weeks?
[04:52.130 --> 04:54.930]  Yeah, I think technically three weeks. I think it's the longest break we've had.
[04:55.030 --> 04:57.330]  Yeah, this was the longest gap. It's been horrible.
[04:57.790 --> 05:02.310]  Way, way, way too long to go without recording.
[05:02.310 --> 05:08.050]  I got so fucking lonely. At one point, I texted Gavin sweet stuff.
[05:08.110 --> 05:08.550]  Really?
[05:08.970 --> 05:09.690]  It's true.
[05:09.850 --> 05:10.270]  Wow.
[05:10.430 --> 05:19.050]  I got so low, I texted... and I was thinking about him, and I just texted nice stuff to him that made me feel incredibly lame after I sent it. But I still did it.
[05:19.190 --> 05:21.290]  I think I texted some nice stuff back, didn't I?
[05:21.370 --> 05:22.670]  You did. You're fairly nice.
[05:22.750 --> 05:22.950]  Yeah.
[05:23.130 --> 05:27.630]  What nice stuff? What tier of niceness are we talking about? Just sappy? Just like sweet?
[05:27.830 --> 05:29.390]  Super sappy. And like...
[05:29.930 --> 05:31.210]  Miss ya buddy type thing?
[05:31.710 --> 05:36.230]  Codependent, and like sad, and lovey, that kind of stuff.
[05:36.390 --> 05:37.430]  Okay. I love it.
[05:37.530 --> 05:43.210]  And I just talk to you a hell of a lot over the holiday. Andrew, I probably talk to you more than anybody outside of my girlfriend or my daughter.
[05:43.370 --> 05:57.870]  I feel like I've started texting Andrew more than everyone else combined. Like, I probably, in the last five years, text Andrew like 50 times, but in the Christmas period, I've probably sent him a thousand texts.
[05:57.870 --> 06:02.470]  That was like the weird thing of the break is Gavin and I have established a texting friendship.
[06:02.710 --> 06:05.470]  Oh, I love that. That's so adorable.
[06:05.950 --> 06:11.970]  I missed these interactions so much. And it, you know, as you could expect, things get out of hand over texts as well.
[06:12.710 --> 06:18.870]  Andrew has spent a lot of the last week trying to beat Donkey Kong 64 just from a random text conversation we had.
[06:20.230 --> 06:34.610]  Before we go any further into that, I have to ask, since we talked about Nick's snooze over the break, has anyone else associated with f***face in any way had any major life-changing events in their personal lives they want to talk to that happened over the break?
[06:34.810 --> 06:35.930]  Anyone? Eric? Maybe?
[06:36.210 --> 06:39.450]  No, I can't think of anything. Maybe, uh, no? I don't...
[06:41.670 --> 06:42.070]  Nope.
[06:42.530 --> 06:43.650]  I can't fucking believe you.
[06:43.850 --> 06:44.130]  Okay.
[06:44.390 --> 06:45.910]  What? What do you want me, Geoff, what is it?
[06:45.910 --> 06:46.950]  What happened to Eric?
[06:47.090 --> 06:48.190]  Yeah, what happened to Eric, Geoff?
[06:48.190 --> 06:52.430]  Nothing. I, uh, apparently nothing. Uh, okay, Andrew, you were talking about Donkey Kong 64.
[06:52.450 --> 06:57.210]  Okay, hey, listen, okay, here, here, I got, there, I, and I got f***ed, and then that's it.
[06:57.350 --> 07:01.410]  You got fucking f***ed, which also we found out on social media!
[07:01.630 --> 07:11.130]  Yeah, because I don't talk about my personal life publicly, but I share with my friends, which I consider you, even though Andrew said that Nick is his favorite.
[07:11.370 --> 07:11.890]  Well, I didn't...
[07:11.890 --> 07:15.070]  So you got, you got bleep. That's really exciting for you, Eric.
[07:15.290 --> 07:15.470]  Yep, yep.
[07:15.630 --> 07:16.910]  Congratulations on bleep, man.
[07:16.910 --> 07:17.310]  Thank you.
[07:17.350 --> 07:28.710]  That's really cool. Yeah, I, uh, all the, all the happiness and love to, to Eric on his bleep and Nick on his baby, and also getting married, apparently, to the woman you had the baby with, which is cool, too.
[07:29.310 --> 07:33.250]  I still can't believe that Nick is Andrew's favorite, even with the blackmail.
[07:33.410 --> 07:34.610]  Of course he is.
[07:34.790 --> 07:44.430]  Well, he's never had to deal with negativity from Nick, but all he gets from you, Eric, is, uh, end the show now, what are you talking about, shut up, end the show.
[07:44.430 --> 07:50.530]  You have no idea the ideas, the amount of ideas he comes to me with that I facilitate or try to help him.
[07:51.070 --> 07:59.190]  There's stuff that's never gonna come to fruition that is just out of control, and I don't know how to make a judgment call with him. It's gonna be a mess.
[07:59.450 --> 08:13.450]  You need to just start a bleep face fund and give the credit card to Andrew, and all you need to do, Eric, is make sure that four to five thousand dollars is in that account at all times, and just wait and see what happens.
[08:13.450 --> 08:21.810]  I will say, now that Nick is gone, I can say that I specifically said my favorite that I know the least about. I didn't say favorite, Eric.
[08:22.570 --> 08:24.170]  Oh, so it's a ratio thing.
[08:24.650 --> 08:31.370]  It was a ratio, Nick is great, I'm not saying he's my favorite of all time ever, great guy, love Nick, but I didn't say that.
[08:31.870 --> 08:43.250]  Second of all, I have an appreciation for Eric because I brought up something to him that is an absurd thing to spend any amount of money on, makes no sense, and he never once asked why.
[08:43.250 --> 08:48.990]  I said what it was, and he essentially said, like, well, what color? And I love it, I appreciate it, it's fantastic.
[08:49.750 --> 08:50.030]  That's awesome.
[08:50.030 --> 08:55.350]  So I have a lot of respect for Eric as well. Eric ranks high. I didn't know Eric got bleeped, so apparently I don't rank high.
[08:55.630 --> 09:01.310]  There you go. You should follow each other on social media. That's how he talks to his friends, apparently. And the rest of the world.
[09:01.570 --> 09:04.330]  I text Geoff and he doesn't text me back, does that happen to you guys too?
[09:04.390 --> 09:06.830]  That's not true, I always text you back!
[09:07.010 --> 09:09.230]  I mean, just let me know if that happens to you guys also.
[09:09.410 --> 09:10.730]  Hey Eric, do I text you back?
[09:10.830 --> 09:11.870]  I don't think I have your number.
[09:11.870 --> 09:12.850]  There you go.
[09:16.330 --> 09:21.330]  Well, maybe if you sent me a thousand texts, like the new text buddies, I would respond to a few of them.
[09:21.490 --> 09:24.690]  Text you on Monday, hey, did you watch the New Year's Tom Segura arm break shit?
[09:24.910 --> 09:26.850]  Oh, shit, I'm sorry, I didn't respond.
[09:26.850 --> 09:29.250]  Oh, no, no, don't apologize, I get it.
[09:29.310 --> 09:31.190]  No, I wanted to, no, Eric...
[09:31.190 --> 09:34.570]  It's fine, I understand. I talk to Emily sometimes, it's not a big deal, don't worry about it.
[09:34.570 --> 09:39.650]  Yeah, I did watch it, and by the way, if you're not familiar with what Eric's talking about,
[09:39.750 --> 09:44.170]  another peer or competing podcast of actually famous people that are talented,
[09:44.790 --> 09:49.710]  the Tom Segura, your mom's house, well, actually, Tom Segura and Burt Kreischer's Two Bears, One Cave,
[09:49.750 --> 09:54.390]  they did a live show on New Year's Eve, and they had footage of them playing basketball,
[09:55.010 --> 10:01.530]  and Tom went up to do a dunk, and all of, I guess he tore the patella in his knee,
[10:01.530 --> 10:07.390]  which is a really bad thing to tear, and so he collapsed, and his left arm was behind him,
[10:07.870 --> 10:14.670]  and so he got like a Joe Theismann or Gordon Hayward or Paul George-level broken bone,
[10:15.130 --> 10:20.090]  where he just crushed his arm, and it was bent backwards, and he was laying on the ground,
[10:20.190 --> 10:24.970]  and they have it in 37 different fucking angles, because they were filming it for a TV, for an online special,
[10:25.190 --> 10:27.710]  and then Burt Kreischer walks over when they realize what's happened,
[10:27.710 --> 10:33.210]  and he just picks up his bent backwards arm, and just goes, let me get that for you, and just bends it back straight,
[10:33.350 --> 10:37.770]  and you can see like the bones sticking out and shit. It is fucking horrendous.
[10:38.350 --> 10:38.490]  Ew.
[10:38.750 --> 10:43.390]  Is there a good thing to tear in your knee? You said it was a bad thing, apparently a bad thing to tear.
[10:43.390 --> 10:44.470]  I don't think there's a good thing.
[10:44.530 --> 10:48.010]  No, I don't think there is either, but I think it's worse than, like, it's like if it were a sports injury,
[10:48.070 --> 10:51.310]  it would have been a career-ending injury. Anyway, we can cut that from the podcast if it's not interesting,
[10:51.470 --> 10:55.690]  but it was fucking crazy, and I did, and I've seen it so many times, Eric, that I'm desensitized to it.
[10:55.710 --> 10:56.690]  It doesn't gross me out anymore.
[10:56.690 --> 10:58.210]  I think it would gross people out.
[10:58.250 --> 10:58.990]  So gross.
[10:59.490 --> 11:05.630]  Anyway, now that we're all caught up on well wishes and catching up and your budding text friendship,
[11:06.010 --> 11:08.970]  how's everybody's break? Do you guys have a lot of stuff to talk about?
[11:09.110 --> 11:13.430]  I looked at my phone, my notes I keep, and I have ten things to talk about, which means...
[11:13.430 --> 11:13.790]  Really?
[11:14.110 --> 11:18.890]  That'll be my content for the next six months, because we'll probably get to one every other week.
[11:19.570 --> 11:25.510]  I feel like the last ten episodes have been Geoff struggling to squeeze in one thing off his list.
[11:26.190 --> 11:28.610]  It's been tough, but it's hard to get to.
[11:28.670 --> 11:31.770]  I didn't have much happen over the break, so this might be you.
[11:31.950 --> 11:32.250]  Alright.
[11:32.490 --> 11:37.770]  I'm trying to think, what happened? I had to run around my building almost naked, mainly naked, like a blanket.
[11:38.190 --> 11:38.790]  That was fun.
[11:38.950 --> 11:41.890]  Oh, you said you got, like, tricked by a delivery driver or something?
[11:42.050 --> 11:47.430]  Oh yeah, it was infuriating. So my building is weird where my door doesn't line up with the door to the building,
[11:47.550 --> 11:52.230]  so sometimes people deliver things to the front of the building, even though that's not where I'm at.
[11:52.330 --> 11:55.230]  Your door doesn't line up with the door to the building.
[11:55.230 --> 12:02.230]  No, if you go to the front, it's like a complex, and if you go through the front door of the complex, you'll never find my door.
[12:02.510 --> 12:04.150]  It just isn't, it's not attached to that.
[12:05.170 --> 12:06.170]  Do you just not live there?
[12:06.350 --> 12:08.330]  No, I don't live there. Technically, I don't live there.
[12:08.490 --> 12:11.670]  But it's my address, so it's super confusing for getting deliveries.
[12:12.130 --> 12:17.810]  But most of the time it's not an issue, because I can put a pin of where they need to go, even though it doesn't match with the address, they'll go there.
[12:17.810 --> 12:24.930]  But this person completely ignored the pin, and I had ordered it, every piece of bottom half clothing I had was in the wash at that time,
[12:25.270 --> 12:27.630]  so I was Winnie the Pooh-ing it, once again, no pants.
[12:27.850 --> 12:29.330]  Is that a pretty common thing for you?
[12:29.570 --> 12:29.930]  No.
[12:30.150 --> 12:33.070]  Because I'm starting to see you in my head that way, it happens so much.
[12:33.110 --> 12:38.750]  No, I know it happened with the ankle, but outside of that, this is the only other time where I've been in this situation.
[12:39.050 --> 12:42.490]  Yeah, I'll be honest, it's like replacing my mental image of you.
[12:42.590 --> 12:44.810]  Yeah, same, same, it's like when I think of Andrew...
[12:44.810 --> 12:51.690]  Usually when I think of someone, like I think of Geoff or I think of Andrew, I think of someone just in a generic outfit, I'm not imagining what they're wearing,
[12:51.750 --> 12:56.770]  but you now, I'm specifically imagining your lower half just with your knob out all the time.
[12:56.910 --> 12:59.790]  What color shirt is he wearing when you're imagining it?
[12:59.890 --> 13:02.030]  I think he's wearing a pale blue for me.
[13:02.190 --> 13:06.590]  It's red just like Winnie the Pooh for me. It's like he's literally wearing a Winnie the Pooh shirt.
[13:07.310 --> 13:09.950]  This shirt's even got a collar, it's a short-sleeved shirt with a collar.
[13:13.390 --> 13:20.630]  So I ordered it, and then they text you like a photo of where they left it, and it was the photo of the front of the building, and I was waiting for it,
[13:20.770 --> 13:24.430]  and so I didn't have any bottoms, so I just grabbed what I had, which was this small blanket,
[13:24.810 --> 13:30.390]  and I had to run through the rain and lap the building essentially, quickly grab my food.
[13:30.550 --> 13:35.510]  I ran past like two people, and all I have is this small throw blanket covering my bottom half.
[13:35.650 --> 13:39.750]  I don't even have shoes on because it's a popular area, I don't want my food to get stolen.
[13:39.750 --> 13:46.050]  So I grab it and I run back. I'm frustrated, I open everything, and I got a lemonade,
[13:46.190 --> 13:51.350]  because lemonade, I think a very underrated thing about lemonade, may be the best travel beverage of all time.
[13:51.470 --> 13:56.470]  If you're getting it from a fast food restaurant, it travels so well, the ice doesn't impact it, it's a great...
[13:56.470 --> 13:58.390]  I would say it's the best travel beverage you could get.
[13:58.670 --> 13:58.990]  Interesting.
[13:59.290 --> 14:01.690]  Do you know where they make the best lemonade in the world, Andrew?
[14:01.910 --> 14:03.030]  I don't, I'd love to know.
[14:03.190 --> 14:05.530]  Gavin, do you remember where they make the best lemonade in the world?
[14:05.690 --> 14:07.350]  Oh, was I there at the best lemonade?
[14:07.350 --> 14:13.130]  You were, yeah. It's in Hungary, in Budapest, Hungary, supposedly is where the best lemonade in the world is.
[14:13.730 --> 14:14.410]  Based on what?
[14:14.550 --> 14:15.210]  It's a whole thing there.
[14:15.530 --> 14:21.570]  So if you ever go to... what I'm saying is, not only does it travel well, but if you go to Hungary, it will taste really well too.
[14:21.750 --> 14:22.690]  Okay, Andrew, if you ever go.
[14:22.710 --> 14:24.590]  Okay, noted. On my list.
[14:25.030 --> 14:31.970]  So I get my drink, and I'm trying to put the straw in, and it just won't go in, and I'm getting frustrated, and the straw is bending,
[14:31.970 --> 14:38.270]  and I can't figure it out, and then I lift the lid, because I think, like, maybe there's two lids, and that's just one lid.
[14:38.630 --> 14:44.490]  They fucking, with clear tape, they taped over the lid, the straw hole. I've never seen that.
[14:44.770 --> 14:48.090]  I don't know what the purpose of that is outside of fucking with me, why would you do that?
[14:48.150 --> 14:48.910]  Probably a hygiene.
[14:49.270 --> 14:52.290]  Yeah, they're probably just taping the lid down, so it doesn't spill.
[14:52.510 --> 14:59.590]  No, but it's just like fucking, they use scotch tape. It wasn't like a sticker, it was like somebody scotch taped across, over the hole,
[14:59.590 --> 15:04.830]  and I couldn't see it, because it's clear tape, and it's a clear, it's like a, it matches the lid.
[15:05.010 --> 15:09.170]  Are you still, are you back in your place now, or are you holding up a blanket still?
[15:09.170 --> 15:11.630]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm now back in my place.
[15:11.750 --> 15:12.870]  Okay, Dick's out again.
[15:13.150 --> 15:22.470]  Dick is still out, thing's still in the dryer, and I'm just furiously stabbing this drink with a straw, and it will not go through, and it was a tape issue.
[15:22.470 --> 15:30.550]  I've ordered plenty of food before, I've never had the top sealed like that, and also the bag was like, stapled shut, so it's like, what are you doing?
[15:30.890 --> 15:33.870]  I don't need that much security, I don't know what the value is of the tape.
[15:33.930 --> 15:37.310]  No, it's like, tamper-proof, it's making sure the drivers aren't eating your food.
[15:37.410 --> 15:42.210]  They could just take the fucking lid off, if they want to, second of all, I'm ordering...
[15:42.210 --> 15:45.410]  Isn't the lid taped down too? Like, doesn't the tape extend over the lip?
[15:45.410 --> 15:52.070]  No, the lid was just the lid, they just taped down the little, it was a tiny little cross that only covered the straw hole.
[15:52.110 --> 15:56.490]  And it's like, I'm ordering from a fucking fast food place, I don't need it to be Fort Knox.
[15:56.630 --> 16:01.990]  I'm okay, I'm accepting a level of risk, I can live with that, but I've never had it taped before.
[16:02.190 --> 16:09.730]  And it just felt like I was being fucked with, and for it to go back to back, with my pantsless run around the building, and then have the drink thing, I was just fed up.
[16:09.830 --> 16:12.510]  I was furious. As irate. So that was my food thing.
[16:12.630 --> 16:14.090]  Was it from a hamburger sandwich shop?
[16:14.550 --> 16:16.930]  Those don't exist. So, no.
[16:17.570 --> 16:24.770]  I'm gonna go out on a limb, Andrew, and say that they weren't pranking you, they were just trying to keep it from spilling. Probably from past experience.
[16:24.970 --> 16:28.870]  How often does a thing spill out the straw hole? That never happens.
[16:29.030 --> 16:35.910]  I would ask the professionals. As a matter of fact, why don't you order from them again, and in the special notes, ask them the question.
[16:35.910 --> 16:46.950]  Be like, last time I ordered, I noticed, or two times ago, I noticed some tape over the lip. Is this a common practice? And if so, is it born from being overly cautious? Was there an inciting incident?
[16:47.170 --> 16:51.450]  How are they gonna reply, though? Are they gonna leave a note? They're not gonna send a representative with the food.
[16:51.530 --> 17:02.490]  Dude, if you can order a pizza from Domino's and ask them to draw a Pikachu on it, and they fucking do it in full color, I'm sure they can jot a note down saying, yeah, dipshit, we don't want it to spill.
[17:03.750 --> 17:04.950]  Also, we spit in everything.
[17:04.950 --> 17:19.930]  I've gotta be honest, if I had nothing to wear, I don't think I would resort to just putting a blanket around my bare cock and balls and ass. I would probably just quickly put on something dirty, because that's gonna be a lot more convenient than holding a blanket around myself.
[17:19.990 --> 17:26.430]  Before the blanket, I would grab a t-shirt and put my legs through the fucking armholes and pull it up and tie it like a belt.
[17:26.570 --> 17:28.730]  Well, then you'd be dangling through the neck hole.
[17:28.930 --> 17:31.570]  Not if you leave enough space, like MC Hammerpants, kind of.
[17:32.030 --> 17:37.170]  You guys are also just summoning items. I didn't have either of those. Those weren't choices. I had to go.
[17:37.270 --> 17:42.290]  So you had no access to any lower half clothing anywhere?
[17:42.650 --> 17:51.310]  No, not at the time. I would have had to go up several levels. It couldn't have been further from me where my clothing was.
[17:51.670 --> 17:56.750]  So I just grabbed what I had in the space that I was in, and the most cover I could get was a blanket.
[17:56.910 --> 17:59.570]  You hate changing floors. I feel like we've established this.
[17:59.570 --> 18:11.310]  Here's the thing. It's not even a hatred of changing floors. My food is out there, Gavin. Busy street. Every second is a layer of risk, and I'm taking a gamble by going for the extra levels.
[18:11.810 --> 18:15.370]  I mean, if it's that desperate, why are you ordering food with no pants on?
[18:15.550 --> 18:27.850]  Well, because it's never happened before. This is an anomaly. This was a shocking thing that has never happened, and for it to go back to back with also the straw being covered was wild. It was too... never seen it before.
[18:27.850 --> 18:37.550]  If I saw a guy shuffling through the rain holding a blanket around his lower half, I would definitely think he's got no underwear on. That's exactly what that says to me.
[18:37.770 --> 18:42.210]  Yeah, but why do you care? I don't care. That doesn't bother me.
[18:42.550 --> 18:44.610]  Oh, well, yeah, that's a good point.
[18:44.610 --> 18:56.630]  What if it was the guy's first day and then, like, the next day he came into work and his boss was like, listen, we've had like 30 complaints from bottomless Canadian men who had to go outside in the rain to get their orders.
[18:56.770 --> 19:00.830]  You've gotta... we gotta mix things up. You gotta do things differently. It's upsetting the balance.
[19:01.150 --> 19:05.430]  I didn't complain. I just... I went about my day and was very confused by the lemonade.
[19:05.750 --> 19:07.050]  How was the lemonade when you got it open?
[19:07.370 --> 19:11.290]  Delicious. It travels so good. Lemonade is such a good travel drink.
[19:11.350 --> 19:13.250]  Do they put, like, chunks of real lemon in it?
[19:13.250 --> 19:15.810]  Absolutely not. No, this is like a fast food.
[19:15.950 --> 19:22.550]  Have you got any extra use out of your Keurig since the cookie coffee and all that garba?
[19:22.770 --> 19:29.090]  Have I ever? I'm loving the Keurig. I haven't made a cup of coffee in it since, but I'm loving it. I'm having a great time.
[19:29.250 --> 19:32.150]  I still think you should give coffee another chance, maybe in a clean mug.
[19:32.150 --> 19:40.750]  I definitely will. I'm not done with coffee. I just have been really enjoying... I got a whole hot chocolate lifestyle going right now. Fantastic from bed.
[19:41.050 --> 19:45.450]  I haven't moved my Keurig. It's where my waffle maker used to be. It's still next to my bed.
[19:45.790 --> 19:54.250]  I feel like your level of enjoyment of anything is very highly impacted by how little you have to move.
[19:54.570 --> 20:00.590]  Like, if everything that you need is in the same room, it, like, boosts your joy somehow.
[20:00.590 --> 20:07.010]  How delightful. Just imagine, Gavin, how delightful it is. You wake up. You don't even have to get out of bed.
[20:07.090 --> 20:12.050]  You're still wrapped up in covers. You're comfy. And you click a button and you got hot chocolate all of a sudden.
[20:12.250 --> 20:16.870]  Now you're drinking hot chocolate from bed. You haven't even gotten out of bed. That's a win on the day.
[20:16.990 --> 20:20.230]  You're like the poor version of Caligula Bot in Futurama.
[20:21.590 --> 20:25.930]  I just like hot chocolate. It's a delicious beverage and I can enjoy it from my bed.
[20:26.030 --> 20:29.510]  What's the first thing you did this morning after you left your bedroom?
[20:30.470 --> 20:31.970]  Have you left your bedroom today?
[20:32.790 --> 20:37.050]  No, I have. I have. I'm trying to think. I went to the kitchen, I guess.
[20:37.610 --> 20:39.570]  Yeah, I went to the kitchen. I made toast.
[20:39.810 --> 20:40.370]  You made toast?
[20:40.510 --> 20:41.730]  Yeah, it's not that eventful.
[20:41.790 --> 20:44.290]  What was the clothing situation on that journey?
[20:44.490 --> 20:45.830]  I had underwear. I had underwear on.
[20:45.910 --> 20:46.650]  Okay, cool.
[20:46.950 --> 20:47.830]  I'm not a pants guy.
[20:48.070 --> 20:49.270]  Teddy whities or boxers?
[20:49.270 --> 20:52.390]  Never. No, I'm more of a boxer, boxer brief guy.
[20:52.550 --> 20:53.170]  Gotcha. Me too.
[20:53.830 --> 21:03.910]  So in our big long text conversation, we got into the subject of Donkey Kong 64, which to me is a game that I played in like 1999 or whatever it came out.
[21:04.110 --> 21:05.370]  When did it come out, Andrew? Somewhere around then?
[21:05.490 --> 21:06.010]  I have no idea.
[21:06.230 --> 21:08.870]  Yeah, I don't know why I'm asking. So I love it because I was a kid.
[21:09.130 --> 21:14.250]  Andrew is always talking about how it's such a shit game and he lists reasons it's shitty.
[21:14.450 --> 21:20.770]  And looking back on it, yeah, it has like a billion collectibles and you have to play every level like five times because it's five characters.
[21:20.770 --> 21:26.030]  So it is a pain in the ass and they make you play the original Donkey Kong, which is freaking impossible for me for some reason.
[21:26.290 --> 21:28.130]  It's not a fun game, the original Donkey Kong.
[21:28.310 --> 21:32.650]  No, I'm so bad, especially on a Nintendo 64 controller for some reason.
[21:33.390 --> 21:37.690]  So Andrew, he's always been shitting on it. And then he announces to me, I've never played it.
[21:38.050 --> 21:38.450]  No.
[21:38.690 --> 21:45.150]  Never touched it. So I challenged him to play the whole of Donkey Kong 64 by the next recording, which is today.
[21:45.390 --> 21:50.090]  And I was thinking he'd probably actually quite enjoy it. Andrew, thoughts?
[21:50.090 --> 21:55.930]  It starts out awful. It's terrible. Like the first, I don't know, 10 hours, not great.
[21:56.530 --> 22:02.350]  Then it gets enjoyable for maybe six hours. And then I haven't played it because it's dreadful once again.
[22:02.550 --> 22:07.670]  There's so many characters. There's so many unnecessary currencies. There's just too much everything.
[22:08.190 --> 22:14.770]  Geoff, I had him stream just to me his progress in Donkey Kong. And I didn't have a mic, no game audio.
[22:14.930 --> 22:19.450]  I'm just like going about my day, glancing at my iPad with his Donkey Kong stream.
[22:19.450 --> 22:25.470]  And he finally gets to the original Donkey Kong bit. You have to pull a lever on an arcade machine.
[22:25.870 --> 22:27.690]  And you have to watch that cut scene every time you try it.
[22:27.950 --> 22:33.050]  And I was watching him eat shit at original Donkey Kong over and over and over again.
[22:33.110 --> 22:36.730]  Even to the point where I got Meg. I went and got her. I was like, you got to watch this.
[22:36.790 --> 22:39.910]  He's trying to beat this. He's trying to beat like four levels of original Donkey Kong.
[22:40.250 --> 22:43.790]  And at one point he got so far and we were both like on the edge of our seats.
[22:43.930 --> 22:46.550]  We're like, oh, he's going to do it. And then he ate it right at the end.
[22:46.550 --> 22:52.490]  Like for some reason, walked into Donkey Kong as Mario. Just like walked into his ass and died.
[22:52.990 --> 22:55.930]  And I immediately was like, oh, he's going to be pissed at that.
[22:56.170 --> 23:00.510]  And immediately on the stream, it comes out of the arcade machine back to 3D Donkey Kong.
[23:00.670 --> 23:04.550]  And he just starts slapping the shit out of the machine and throwing grenades at it.
[23:04.650 --> 23:07.310]  So I was like, oh, he's definitely pissed off.
[23:08.110 --> 23:12.510]  They don't explain how to beat Donkey Kong. They just introduce an entirely new mechanic.
[23:12.750 --> 23:15.010]  And I thought, well, maybe I need to interact with him in some way.
[23:15.010 --> 23:17.990]  But you don't. You just die immediately. Back to the beginning.
[23:18.510 --> 23:22.230]  I was playing Donkey Kong while I believe you're watching The Hobbit, Gavin.
[23:22.350 --> 23:26.530]  And I think you may have finished The Hobbit before I beat the Donkey Kong thing.
[23:26.730 --> 23:32.110]  I was going to finish The Hobbit, but in the end I just paused The Hobbit because I thought what you were doing with Donkey Kong was more entertaining.
[23:33.030 --> 23:38.150]  I did it. It took like, what, two hours? I think I played that for at least two hours straight.
[23:38.230 --> 23:41.690]  I was very impressed. I've never had the patience to get past that bit.
[23:41.850 --> 23:43.890]  It's a good game, but it's not a good game.
[23:43.890 --> 23:49.990]  At the time, I could see why. I said to Gavin, it's like the cookie dough ice cream of video games.
[23:50.350 --> 23:57.430]  Or it's like your favorite if you played it as a kid, but then once you learn what good things taste like and become sensible as an adult, you can't go back to it.
[23:57.630 --> 24:03.550]  I feel like being an adult is people telling you that the stuff you like, in fact, isn't very good.
[24:04.030 --> 24:08.350]  Like you with Donkey Kong, Geoff, obviously, with telling me that Ace Ventura 2 isn't good.
[24:08.810 --> 24:11.930]  And just people just tearing down your childhood pleasure.
[24:11.930 --> 24:14.590]  I still like cookie dough ice cream.
[24:14.670 --> 24:15.270]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[24:15.410 --> 24:16.510]  When was the last time you had it?
[24:16.630 --> 24:19.010]  Uh, well, we have something in Austin.
[24:19.870 --> 24:24.530]  We have HEB. Our grocery store has ice cream and they have something called cookie two-step.
[24:24.810 --> 24:29.150]  And I have it all the time. It's half cookie dough and then half like Oreo ice cream.
[24:29.330 --> 24:32.190]  But that's a different thing. You're just talking about a different ice cream flavor.
[24:32.410 --> 24:33.790]  But half of it is cookie dough.
[24:33.930 --> 24:36.150]  Yeah, but there's a different fucking flavor. What do you mean?
[24:36.290 --> 24:37.970]  That's not, you can't, those don't correlate.
[24:38.090 --> 24:40.970]  It's both. It's cookie two-step. Half of it is cookie dough.
[24:40.970 --> 24:41.810]  It's not mixed.
[24:42.170 --> 24:43.350]  You eat half of the time?
[24:43.810 --> 24:45.930]  No, I like both, so I eat both at the same time.
[24:45.950 --> 24:46.710]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[24:46.710 --> 24:47.530]  The point is I like cookie dough ice cream.
[24:47.530 --> 24:48.390]  You're no longer eating...
[24:48.390 --> 24:55.490]  If the goddamn other kind of, if the other step in the two-step wasn't there, I would be just as happy eating the cookie dough.
[24:55.610 --> 24:57.990]  I don't know about that. It's a very basic ice cream.
[24:58.130 --> 25:07.070]  I think if I wasn't fucking keto right now, I would go buy some right now and film a video of me eating a carton of cookie dough ice cream with a fucking smile.
[25:07.230 --> 25:08.630]  I gotta try that. Sounds good.
[25:08.630 --> 25:10.630]  It is good. It's fucking super good. It's H-E-B, baby.
[25:11.070 --> 25:16.550]  Or if it's not H-E-B, it's either H-E-B or it's the other one, Blue Bell. I can't remember.
[25:16.930 --> 25:18.330]  The one with the...
[25:18.770 --> 25:19.130]  Botulism.
[25:19.490 --> 25:19.610]  Yeah.
[25:21.590 --> 25:25.230]  If that's where you're going with that, yeah. It's one of the two.
[25:28.010 --> 25:30.370]  So you don't like Donkey Kong 64, huh?
[25:30.630 --> 25:36.690]  It's a bad game. If you're a kid, it would be great. It has things in it that are really impressive for the time, but playing in 2020, it's not great.
[25:36.690 --> 25:48.310]  I mean, mostly I was just blown... because I was just thrown out like, oh, maybe you could beat it before we next record. And suddenly you're playing it. It's like, it takes like 30 hours to beat the thing. I've just ruined your week, by the sounds of it.
[25:48.330 --> 25:53.630]  Yeah, I was mad at you. It's very easy to get me to do something. You said, I challenge you to do it. And I was like, yeah, I'll do it.
[25:53.990 --> 25:57.350]  We didn't even do it for any prize or any money or anything. You're just doing it.
[25:57.350 --> 26:11.110]  Yeah, there's no stakes. You said, I challenge you to do it. I'm like, okay, sure. And then I looked at how long to beat, which Eric posted, and it's like a 28 hour game. I think I just said, you fuck, and I sent you a screenshot of like the average playthrough time.
[26:11.390 --> 26:14.550]  It's a 28 hour game, but not the way you would have played it, when you're racing that beetle.
[26:15.570 --> 26:21.830]  Fucking beetle. There's a slide, Geoff, where you have to beat this beetle and get 50 coins, and it just is terrible. It's impossible.
[26:22.290 --> 26:25.090]  Yeah, I wouldn't know. I've never even owned a 64.
[26:25.410 --> 26:26.070]  It's a great console.
[26:26.070 --> 26:27.710]  I guess. I don't know.
[26:27.890 --> 26:32.050]  Mario Party? Come on, but the first two Mario Parties are so good. Great games.
[26:32.130 --> 26:33.210]  Those are good games, for sure.
[26:33.570 --> 26:36.350]  Classics. No Donkey Kong 64 you could skip.
[26:36.490 --> 26:47.150]  I was actually kind of mad at you over the break a little bit, Andrew, because you texted me out of the blue for no other reason than to just tell me everything I thought about Fruit was wrong.
[26:48.130 --> 26:48.990]  Oh, yeah.
[26:48.990 --> 26:59.850]  I got so annoyed, and I felt so dumb, and I was just getting mad and belligerent at you, and then I would just be wrong every time. It was like every time I was wrong, and I just felt... it made me madder and more belligerent.
[26:59.930 --> 27:01.610]  Maybe we should find that text conversation.
[27:01.910 --> 27:08.290]  I don't remember every aspect of it, but yeah, I said something, and Geoff called me an idiot for asking, and I was right.
[27:08.390 --> 27:11.490]  He was like, is a fruit a banana? And I'm like, of course it is, you idiot. Stop.
[27:12.010 --> 27:14.290]  No, it's a banana berry.
[27:14.490 --> 27:18.590]  Banana berry, that's it. And I'm like, of course it's not, you moron. And apparently it is.
[27:18.590 --> 27:22.270]  That was my reaction too, and so then I put it in to see, because there are things...
[27:22.270 --> 27:24.990]  And then strawberries aren't berries!
[27:25.370 --> 27:26.270]  It's very confusing.
[27:26.790 --> 27:28.130]  Blackberries aren't berries!
[27:28.530 --> 27:36.690]  People call me crazy, and that I'm like an alien? The world just doesn't make sense. I don't think it's a me issue. Labeling of things makes zero sense at all.
[27:36.690 --> 27:46.450]  I remember the basis of that argument was that you were saying whether a banana would want to be considered a berry or not.
[27:46.650 --> 27:52.550]  And my argument was that a banana is a big enough thing on its own, it's surpassed berrydom.
[27:52.890 --> 27:56.210]  It's bigger. It's like Justin Timberlake and NSYNC, right?
[27:56.430 --> 28:00.350]  The berries are NSYNC. Blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, those are NSYNC.
[28:00.770 --> 28:02.810]  And a banana is Justin Timberlake.
[28:03.270 --> 28:06.530]  Yeah, he's a part of NSYNC, but he's got a much bigger career on his own.
[28:06.870 --> 28:12.630]  And if he ever goes back and hangs out with the other berries, it's only to help them make a little bit of money because they're not doing as well as him.
[28:12.850 --> 28:14.770]  NSYNC is like a berry smoothie.
[28:15.010 --> 28:17.390]  Because you always get banana in that for some reason.
[28:17.650 --> 28:17.810]  Yeah.
[28:17.970 --> 28:19.230]  I guess because banana's a berry.
[28:19.450 --> 28:21.050]  I think you're overrating the banana.
[28:21.270 --> 28:24.610]  No, I think bananas on their own, they're a whole industry, man.
[28:24.830 --> 28:25.510]  In what sense?
[28:25.750 --> 28:26.490]  They're iconic.
[28:26.730 --> 28:27.570]  In what way?
[28:28.010 --> 28:28.370]  Bananas?
[28:28.650 --> 28:29.010]  Yeah.
[28:29.170 --> 28:32.630]  You don't think a banana is a bigger thing than all other berries put together?
[28:32.970 --> 28:34.370]  You mean like in literal size?
[28:34.530 --> 28:35.150]  Like in dollars?
[28:35.510 --> 28:37.870]  No, like in notoriety and fame.
[28:40.050 --> 28:40.410]  Notoriety?
[28:40.790 --> 28:44.170]  What are you tracking, that it has a Gwen Stefani song?
[28:44.310 --> 28:45.930]  When you think of a monkey, what do you think of?
[28:45.990 --> 28:46.730]  You think of a banana.
[28:47.090 --> 28:48.770]  When you think of people slipping, what do you think of?
[28:48.990 --> 28:49.910]  You think of a banana.
[28:51.170 --> 28:52.210]  I don't think of a banana.
[28:52.210 --> 28:54.330]  It has more screen time than the other berries.
[28:54.330 --> 28:57.130]  Yeah, it has way more star power than the other berries.
[28:57.490 --> 28:59.090]  Banana's Justin Timberlake, that's all I'm saying.
[28:59.310 --> 29:01.370]  Donkey Kong gets health by eating watermelons.
[29:01.770 --> 29:02.230]  Not bananas.
[29:02.670 --> 29:04.010]  Very confusing. It's a curveball.
[29:04.170 --> 29:04.770]  You wouldn't expect that.
[29:05.130 --> 29:07.690]  But he's off to bananas the whole time.
[29:07.830 --> 29:09.110]  He collects them. Doesn't eat them.
[29:09.230 --> 29:11.570]  So what's a gooseberry? Is that a berry?
[29:12.130 --> 29:12.770]  I have no idea.
[29:13.030 --> 29:15.290]  Nothing called berry is a berry, apparently.
[29:15.570 --> 29:17.670]  I was thinking about where does the goose come from?
[29:17.730 --> 29:19.070]  Why is there goose in gooseberry?
[29:19.310 --> 29:20.310]  That's what was confusing me.
[29:20.310 --> 29:21.530]  How do we get the goose?
[29:21.830 --> 29:23.190]  Where's the straw in a strawberry?
[29:24.470 --> 29:26.430]  Once again, that's another good question.
[29:26.570 --> 29:28.110]  I can't argue blueberry.
[29:28.410 --> 29:29.030]  That one's pretty obvious.

[29:36.110 --> 29:38.050]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[29:38.270 --> 29:39.770]  That's because whether after work,
[29:39.830 --> 29:41.350]  at barbecues, or at a bar,

[31:14.160 --> 31:16.120]  shops I've bought from in my life. I bet it's
[31:16.120 --> 31:18.180]  not 30,000. But I bet they've
[31:18.180 --> 31:19.940]  all been within that 30,000. Anyway,

[32:48.620 --> 32:50.080]  HelloFresh. Good for them.
[32:50.500 --> 32:51.820]  The thing for me is variety.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.140]  I get bored easily, and that's where HelloFresh
[32:54.140 --> 32:55.960]  is super convenient because they
[32:55.960 --> 32:58.020]  have more than 23 recipes

[33:05.740 --> 33:07.940]  and ingredients. So boredom is not
[33:07.940 --> 33:09.620]  an issue. I also am
[33:09.620 --> 33:11.820]  always trying to eat healthier, especially as I get
[33:11.820 --> 33:13.920]  older, and it gets harder and
[33:13.920 --> 33:15.080]  harder to shake off the weight.
[33:16.100 --> 33:17.960]  And luckily, it's never been

[33:26.440 --> 33:27.940]  every single recipe is
[33:27.940 --> 33:29.540]  packed with fresh produce
[33:29.540 --> 33:31.980]  sourced directly from the farmers and not
[33:31.980 --> 33:33.920]  the oil companies. So cut down on your

[34:09.780 --> 34:11.420]  conversations. Andrew, are you hungry?
[34:11.860 --> 34:13.700]  Are you just hungry? No, I didn't bring this up.
[34:13.780 --> 34:15.240]  You were talking to me about what the best
[34:15.240 --> 34:17.140]  food to faint into would be.
[34:17.520 --> 34:19.580]  Yeah, we had a whole conversation, Geoff,
[34:19.640 --> 34:21.640]  that we had a few things that we'd like
[34:21.640 --> 34:23.740]  you to kind of solve or get your opinion on
[34:23.740 --> 34:24.900]  part of our text conversation.
[34:25.280 --> 34:27.560]  We're talking about if you were gonna
[34:27.560 --> 34:29.580]  pass out while eating at a dinner
[34:29.580 --> 34:31.640]  table, let's say. Assuming you're at a restaurant
[34:31.640 --> 34:33.640]  specifically, and you're
[34:33.640 --> 34:35.480]  going face first, and you know
[34:35.480 --> 34:37.600]  there's nothing you can do, you just gotta pick a
[34:37.600 --> 34:39.580]  spot to land, like the plane is crashing, you
[34:39.580 --> 34:41.700]  gotta land somewhere. What would you
[34:41.700 --> 34:43.580]  ideally hope was on the plate
[34:43.580 --> 34:45.740]  for you to land on? To sustain the
[34:45.740 --> 34:47.080]  least damage. Easy.
[34:47.500 --> 34:48.440]  Loaf of bread.
[34:48.780 --> 34:51.420]  Who just has a loaf of bread on their plate?
[34:52.400 --> 34:53.640]  There's always a loaf of
[34:53.640 --> 34:54.800]  bread in the middle of the table.
[34:55.600 --> 34:57.360]  You're like sat at your...
[34:57.360 --> 34:59.200]  You do not have the reach.
[34:59.200 --> 35:01.220]  You don't have time to leap forward
[35:01.220 --> 35:02.820]  like a salmon and land on
[35:02.820 --> 35:03.840]  a loaf of bread.
[35:04.700 --> 35:07.240]  If I don't have time to leap over the salmon, then I'll
[35:07.240 --> 35:08.020]  go with...
[35:11.300 --> 35:13.300]  I think a beef wellington would be
[35:13.300 --> 35:15.000]  soft. A beef wellington?
[35:15.060 --> 35:17.220]  That's very specific. Well, it's because
[35:17.220 --> 35:19.520]  it's got... it's multi-layered,
[35:19.640 --> 35:20.900]  right? So there's gonna be padding.
[35:21.400 --> 35:23.260]  You've got the beef in the middle, and that
[35:23.260 --> 35:25.300]  beef is gonna be tender because it's been cooked for a long
[35:25.300 --> 35:27.020]  time, so the beef's gonna be spongy and soft.
[35:27.020 --> 35:28.960]  Then you've got that duxelle or whatever
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.020]  layer around it, which is
[35:31.020 --> 35:33.100]  like mushrooms and shit, and that's gonna create
[35:33.100 --> 35:34.840]  a... even if it's like microscopic,
[35:35.020 --> 35:37.060]  a tiny little air pocket between
[35:37.060 --> 35:39.100]  them. And then on top of that, you put
[35:39.100 --> 35:41.040]  the... sometimes some parma ham
[35:41.040 --> 35:43.120]  or something around it, and that's another layer
[35:43.120 --> 35:45.020]  and ham's pretty soft. I think we all know that.
[35:45.260 --> 35:47.060]  And then on top of that, you
[35:47.060 --> 35:49.200]  put the pastry, the flaky
[35:49.200 --> 35:51.100]  pastry, and if I'm hitting...
[35:51.100 --> 35:53.300]  I'm not gonna complain about putting my face through pastry
[35:53.300 --> 35:55.040]  ever. I feel like
[35:55.040 --> 35:56.880]  you're at a juice risk with a
[35:56.880 --> 35:58.940]  beef wellington. You could hit a pocket of
[35:59.540 --> 36:00.900]  meaty, hot juice that could
[36:00.900 --> 36:02.900]  jet out into your face. You could?
[36:03.200 --> 36:05.100]  So, okay, it sounds like you guys have put a lot
[36:05.100 --> 36:07.180]  of thought into this. We have. What did you come up with?
[36:07.220 --> 36:09.060]  Well, it started because I once
[36:09.060 --> 36:10.640]  watched someone faint into
[36:10.640 --> 36:13.140]  tomato soup. It was a blood
[36:13.140 --> 36:14.740]  bath. That would be brutal.
[36:16.300 --> 36:17.080]  And Andrew was
[36:17.080 --> 36:19.200]  like, man, that must be the worst thing to faint into
[36:19.200 --> 36:21.100]  because you could drown
[36:21.100 --> 36:23.120]  in it. And burn yourself if it's hot,
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.300]  right? Yeah, that was my whole thing.
[36:25.420 --> 36:27.180]  Yeah, like, not only do you sustain the
[36:27.180 --> 36:29.380]  blow, there's no relief from the impact
[36:29.380 --> 36:31.220]  of hitting that bowl. You're then just
[36:31.220 --> 36:33.460]  in a hot bowl of liquid constantly
[36:33.460 --> 36:35.080]  burning you. Like a DPS.
[36:35.260 --> 36:37.440]  Like an RPG game. Like a Borderlands
[36:37.440 --> 36:37.960]  like weapon.
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.380]  Yeah, they're face down
[36:41.380 --> 36:43.080]  in the soup and you just see numbers
[36:43.080 --> 36:45.180]  appearing above their head over and over
[36:45.180 --> 36:47.220]  and over again. You don't get that with a
[36:47.220 --> 36:49.160]  loaf of bread. It's kind of what happened to Whitney Houston.
[36:49.420 --> 36:51.160]  I don't know what that means. What do you mean? She drowned in a
[36:51.160 --> 36:51.720]  hot bathtub.
[36:52.260 --> 36:55.120]  Not at all. How is that anything
[36:55.120 --> 36:57.080]  alike? Because she passed out
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.140]  and drowned in hot liquid.
[36:59.520 --> 37:00.860]  But that's not... we're talking
[37:00.860 --> 37:02.960]  tables. This is somebody passing out
[37:02.960 --> 37:05.220]  and drowning. You just said it's a drowning risk
[37:05.220 --> 37:07.220]  and that it would be hot. How is it any
[37:07.220 --> 37:08.960]  different? It is slightly
[37:08.960 --> 37:11.060]  more connected than your whole fucking
[37:11.060 --> 37:13.000]  eating two ice creams and calling it one
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.440]  but it's still ridiculous. If you're eating alone
[37:15.440 --> 37:17.100]  and you have some hot ass
[37:17.100 --> 37:18.720]  tomato soup and you pass out
[37:18.720 --> 37:20.420]  face first into the tomato soup
[37:20.420 --> 37:22.680]  you could drown and burn. Yeah but
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.620]  Geoff, if somebody gave you tomato soup
[37:24.620 --> 37:26.760]  would you ever say this reminds me of Whitney Houston?
[37:27.100 --> 37:28.100]  Like it's such a leap.
[37:28.540 --> 37:30.220]  I don't think it's a leap.
[37:30.420 --> 37:32.620]  I would never connect to this. It's like watching
[37:32.620 --> 37:34.880]  a kid fall into a pond and drown
[37:34.880 --> 37:37.000]  and be like man I want some tomato soup.
[37:38.920 --> 37:40.440]  I don't think
[37:40.440 --> 37:42.520]  those two things are alike at all because
[37:42.520 --> 37:44.640]  I'm not eating tomato
[37:44.640 --> 37:46.580]  soup and then thinking I want to see Whitney Houston
[37:46.580 --> 37:48.240]  drown. Like there's
[37:48.240 --> 37:50.720]  very false equivalencies there between
[37:50.720 --> 37:52.660]  like I... yeah no no I think you're
[37:52.660 --> 37:54.820]  way off base. I think that the two dangers
[37:54.820 --> 37:56.800]  of passing out into tomato soup
[37:56.800 --> 37:58.620]  are the exact same dangers
[37:59.280 --> 38:00.580]  that befell Whitney Houston.
[38:00.980 --> 38:02.040]  I don't see how you don't see that.
[38:02.480 --> 38:04.160]  It's just a weird connection to make.
[38:04.300 --> 38:06.740]  It's the only person I can think of that died by drowning
[38:06.740 --> 38:08.500]  in something hot. If it was anybody
[38:08.500 --> 38:10.720]  else I would have said them. You know it was hot.
[38:10.820 --> 38:12.240]  Yeah she got like second degree burns.
[38:12.440 --> 38:14.200]  It was like scalding hot. Oh Jesus Christ. Yeah it was brutal.
[38:14.200 --> 38:16.180]  To be fair I think the head
[38:16.180 --> 38:18.200]  landing in the soup bowl actually displaced
[38:18.200 --> 38:20.240]  most of the soup. You can drown
[38:20.240 --> 38:21.860]  in a teacup of water they say.
[38:22.100 --> 38:23.760]  A teacup? Or a teaspoon of water.
[38:25.580 --> 38:28.540]  If you can drown in a teaspoon you can definitely drown in a teacup.
[38:28.820 --> 38:29.960]  What if it's one of the ones at Disney World?
[38:30.100 --> 38:31.620]  Disneyland. Those things are huge. Andrew
[38:32.020 --> 38:34.180]  challenged me to pick a food that would be perfect to faint into
[38:34.180 --> 38:35.700]  and I think my
[38:36.440 --> 38:37.240]  suggestion was
[38:37.960 --> 38:40.240]  sponge cake. It was but I felt
[38:40.240 --> 38:42.200]  like that was cheating. I felt like that was like
[38:42.200 --> 38:44.360]  when you're playing a game of you meet a genie
[38:44.360 --> 38:46.160]  and you get three wishes and saying one of your wishes
[38:46.160 --> 38:48.080]  is more wishes. I technically
[38:48.080 --> 38:50.180]  could do that but it's like a cheat. I think you're
[38:50.180 --> 38:51.880]  just telling me that's the perfect answer.
[38:52.060 --> 38:54.220]  No I gave you an even better answer. I initially
[38:54.220 --> 38:56.140]  said that the mashed potato is the
[38:56.140 --> 38:58.180]  crash pad of the food world. Like it's
[38:58.180 --> 39:00.040]  such a perfect thing to land into. Not at all.
[39:00.140 --> 39:02.100]  And Gavin disagreed. You
[39:02.100 --> 39:04.200]  disagreed too. I think that's crazy. I think it's
[39:04.200 --> 39:06.140]  such a good food to land into. No I think
[39:06.140 --> 39:08.160]  that's bad as well. Mashed is hot and also
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.260]  if you've got it in a bowl you could drown in it.
[39:10.260 --> 39:12.420]  And if you've got it on a plate your face
[39:12.420 --> 39:14.280]  will just displace it all and you just
[39:14.280 --> 39:16.160]  hit the plate. He's right. There's no
[39:16.760 --> 39:17.960]  structure to mash but listen
[39:17.960 --> 39:20.240]  I'm a fucking huge fan of mashed potatoes.
[39:20.360 --> 39:21.220]  I love them to death.
[39:22.200 --> 39:23.780]  There's no way you're a bigger potato guy.
[39:24.500 --> 39:26.240]  100% way I'm bigger. I could
[39:26.240 --> 39:28.200]  easily eat you under the table in
[39:28.200 --> 39:30.860]  mashed potatoes. No chance. 100%.
[39:30.860 --> 39:31.540]  I don't even care.
[39:32.080 --> 39:34.340]  I could eat mashed potatoes
[39:34.340 --> 39:35.900]  while doing the
[39:35.900 --> 39:37.800]  fucking sewing machine
[39:37.800 --> 39:39.900]  while you just sat there in bed
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.780]  with no pants on eating mashed potatoes and I would still
[39:41.780 --> 39:43.460]  beat you. I love mashed potatoes that much.
[39:43.740 --> 39:45.740]  But there's no
[39:45.740 --> 39:47.880]  rigidity to it. There's no structure to it
[39:47.880 --> 39:49.960]  like there is with a sponge cake. Gavin's
[39:49.960 --> 39:51.660]  right. You would hit those mashed potatoes and they would be
[39:51.660 --> 39:53.700]  gone instantly. They would fly 30
[39:53.700 --> 39:55.700]  feet. And you're potentially dealing with
[39:55.700 --> 39:57.720]  an immediate seal in your mouth and
[39:57.720 --> 39:59.680]  up your nostrils. If you fall into a
[39:59.680 --> 40:01.860]  big mound of it you're gonna get it right
[40:01.860 --> 40:03.780]  up in there. We're assuming that you
[40:03.780 --> 40:05.660]  have some level of control and impact
[40:05.660 --> 40:07.820]  you would go side of head. You'd land on it
[40:07.820 --> 40:09.500]  like a pillow and it would be great.
[40:09.840 --> 40:11.820]  But then we pivoted
[40:11.820 --> 40:13.740]  because we argued about this and I came to the
[40:13.740 --> 40:15.680]  conclusion that if you're gonna
[40:15.680 --> 40:17.680]  faint at a table you want to do it at breakfast
[40:17.680 --> 40:19.680]  because as the meals and the table
[40:19.680 --> 40:21.880]  progresses through time it becomes more dangerous.
[40:22.080 --> 40:23.620]  The most dangerous table is
[40:23.620 --> 40:25.920]  the dinner table at a restaurant. Safest
[40:25.920 --> 40:27.580]  by far breakfast and
[40:27.580 --> 40:29.620]  name a better food to crash into than a pancake.
[40:29.900 --> 40:31.400]  Just a stack of pancakes
[40:31.400 --> 40:33.480]  it's an edible pillow. Yeah, you got a good point.
[40:33.480 --> 40:35.700]  Pancakes is a good one. Pancakes is real good.
[40:35.760 --> 40:37.420]  And you are right about dinner because you know
[40:37.420 --> 40:39.380]  dinner you've probably got maybe a fancy
[40:39.380 --> 40:41.360]  wine glass and if you land
[40:41.360 --> 40:43.500]  face first on that the stem is gonna go up
[40:43.500 --> 40:45.560]  your jugular. Plus there's probably like a
[40:45.560 --> 40:46.900]  steak knife there. Yeah.
[40:47.320 --> 40:49.540]  You might have meat on the plate and if there's
[40:49.540 --> 40:51.140]  meat there's probably a jagged bone.
[40:51.420 --> 40:53.500]  You have a flame scenario at dinner
[40:53.500 --> 40:55.540]  that you don't have at any other meal. There's gonna
[40:55.540 --> 40:57.400]  be a lit candle most likely. You know the problem with
[40:57.400 --> 40:59.720]  breakfast though is there might be hot coffee
[40:59.720 --> 41:01.620]  around. Maybe not in your world because you're scared
[41:01.620 --> 41:03.640]  of it. I'm not scared. Coffee is like the hottest
[41:03.640 --> 41:05.520]  liquid at the table. Also
[41:05.520 --> 41:07.520]  Americans cook bacon until
[41:07.520 --> 41:09.580]  it's completely rigid to
[41:09.580 --> 41:11.660]  the point where you could land on that and get some
[41:11.660 --> 41:13.620]  pretty severe scratches on
[41:13.620 --> 41:15.620]  your face. It's an interesting, yeah
[41:15.620 --> 41:17.640]  it's an interesting point. I'm
[41:17.640 --> 41:19.700]  trying to think though. In defense of our
[41:19.700 --> 41:21.580]  bacon, our American bacon, I think that
[41:21.580 --> 41:23.540]  we cook it so that it would break
[41:23.540 --> 41:25.620]  apart very easily. Why do you need bacon to
[41:25.620 --> 41:27.660]  break? You want it to be crunchy and crumbly.
[41:27.940 --> 41:29.640]  That's the best way to have bacon. When you eat a
[41:29.640 --> 41:31.760]  steak, are you annoyed when it doesn't snap in half?
[41:31.940 --> 41:33.540]  Those are different things. Totally different.
[41:33.740 --> 41:35.580]  Once again. You guys just have like
[41:35.580 --> 41:37.600]  the worst example. That's such a bad example.
[41:37.900 --> 41:39.520]  No, it's like I want all my meat
[41:39.520 --> 41:41.500]  I want to cook ribs to tender
[41:41.500 --> 41:43.400]  sort of come off the bone nicely. Cook a nice steak.
[41:43.500 --> 41:45.520]  I want my bacon to crumble
[41:45.520 --> 41:47.540]  and snap. What? Well don't you
[41:47.540 --> 41:49.480]  snap into a Slim Jim? Isn't that meat?
[41:49.820 --> 41:51.520]  Slim Jim is... Slim Jim doesn't
[41:51.520 --> 41:53.560]  snap. Snap into a Slim Jim
[41:53.560 --> 41:55.780]  is the fucking... I mean at Achievement Hunter
[41:55.780 --> 41:57.500]  it's slip into a Slim Jim but it's the same thing.
[41:57.500 --> 41:59.100]  Snap into a Slim Jim. Also
[41:59.900 --> 42:01.680]  what about burnt ends on brisket?
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.120]  Like the more cooked the better.
[42:03.480 --> 42:05.680]  The harder the better. You want to gnaw on that shit.
[42:05.960 --> 42:07.500]  Mmm. I mean we'll never agree on
[42:07.500 --> 42:09.180]  bacon. I'm European. It's never gonna happen.
[42:09.320 --> 42:11.480]  That's fair. That's fair. I'm not... I don't want to argue
[42:11.480 --> 42:13.520]  about it. It's just a weird argument that you
[42:13.520 --> 42:15.500]  think all meat should be done the same way
[42:15.500 --> 42:17.400]  is more my issue with your statement. Yeah, I gotta
[42:17.400 --> 42:19.380]  agree with Andrew. Well most meat
[42:20.960 --> 42:21.760]  is... bendy.
[42:22.440 --> 42:23.620]  What? It is!
[42:23.780 --> 42:25.600]  What do you mean most meat is bendy?
[42:26.140 --> 42:27.820]  Most meat, if you hold it at one end
[42:27.820 --> 42:28.920]  it flops at the other end.
[42:30.640 --> 42:31.700]  Okay. Pizza does
[42:31.700 --> 42:33.580]  the same. What do you mean? I don't know
[42:33.580 --> 42:35.360]  what you're talking about. What does the same?
[42:35.840 --> 42:36.920]  He thinks...
[42:37.620 --> 42:39.880]  Gavin's saying that if bacon doesn't
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.560]  flop it's not cooked
[42:41.560 --> 42:43.400]  right. It's overcooked. Yeah.
[42:43.640 --> 42:45.580]  Holding bacon at one end it shouldn't be like a
[42:45.580 --> 42:47.600]  diving board at the other end. And I'll tell you
[42:47.600 --> 42:49.680]  in America when we pick up a piece of bacon
[42:49.680 --> 42:51.480]  if it flops over we think we're gonna get
[42:51.480 --> 42:52.860]  botulism and die.
[42:54.100 --> 42:54.860]  It is undercooked
[42:55.380 --> 42:57.020]  pork. I think the main issue
[42:57.020 --> 42:59.000]  is that Americans use a different piece of the
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.420]  pig for their bacon. Yeah.
[43:00.880 --> 43:02.880]  Yeah, for sure. I don't know if that's true. You guys
[43:02.880 --> 43:04.560]  in Canada, you guys call
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.980]  ham bacon. Yeah, it's a bullshit.
[43:07.260 --> 43:08.920]  Canadian bacon is bullshit. Do you guys
[43:08.920 --> 43:11.020]  call it Canadian bacon there? Isn't that a little
[43:11.020 --> 43:12.600]  redundant? No, it's cause it's not.
[43:12.740 --> 43:14.800]  We have bacon as well. Bacon is bacon
[43:14.800 --> 43:16.600]  and there's Canadian bacon which is just like ham.
[43:16.820 --> 43:19.200]  I see. It's not good. Well that was fascinating.
[43:20.640 --> 43:21.040]  Um...
[43:21.040 --> 43:21.420]  Cool.
[43:23.660 --> 43:24.680]  Why did you break?
[43:24.940 --> 43:27.100]  I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
[43:27.100 --> 43:28.700]  or something, man. I've been off all day.
[43:28.820 --> 43:31.160]  Why are you off? You know, man, I don't know
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.000]  because I'm in a good mood. I've been
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.100]  in a good mood. We just
[43:35.100 --> 43:37.120]  made it worse. No! I'm still in a
[43:37.120 --> 43:38.680]  good mood. Nothing bad happened.
[43:39.220 --> 43:41.200]  I was excited to film. I was really
[43:41.200 --> 43:42.520]  looking forward to filming today.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.040]  And then it's one of those days where you just
[43:45.040 --> 43:46.940]  start talking and you're like, I don't like
[43:46.940 --> 43:47.640]  anything I'm saying.
[43:49.380 --> 43:49.920]  You know
[43:49.920 --> 43:51.360]  what I'm talking about? Does that never happen to you?
[43:51.520 --> 43:53.320]  No, no, no. Absolutely. That's every day.
[43:53.400 --> 43:55.180]  We're all performers. We do it all the time.
[43:55.480 --> 43:57.400]  It's not every day for me. There are days when I'm
[43:57.400 --> 43:59.160]  quite entertained by myself.
[43:59.500 --> 44:01.040]  I'm a big fan of me sometimes.
[44:01.620 --> 44:03.580]  But I'm a harsh critic of me
[44:03.580 --> 44:05.560]  as well and today, I don't like what
[44:05.560 --> 44:07.940]  this dude's talking about. I have it retroactively
[44:07.940 --> 44:09.240]  for sure, but I try not to
[44:09.240 --> 44:11.460]  do it while I'm talking.
[44:12.020 --> 44:13.580]  I try not to be halfway
[44:13.580 --> 44:15.340]  through a sentence and then I'm like...
[44:15.340 --> 44:17.420]  I'm just trying to be more self-aware.
[44:17.720 --> 44:19.540]  I love, Gavin, when you are saying something
[44:19.540 --> 44:21.340]  and realize mid-sentence, nobody
[44:21.340 --> 44:23.420]  cares. It just pivots off. It's fantastic.
[44:23.600 --> 44:25.380]  I'm a big fan of when you do that. I think it only happened
[44:25.380 --> 44:27.680]  once on this podcast when we're talking about magnifying
[44:27.680 --> 44:29.300]  glasses. You wanted this whole thing
[44:29.300 --> 44:31.340]  where it's just like, nobody cares. Sometimes you gotta
[44:31.340 --> 44:33.180]  cut your losses. Yeah, for sure.
[44:34.640 --> 44:35.460]  I have a question
[44:35.460 --> 44:36.980]  for you, Geoff. I got an answer.
[44:37.200 --> 44:39.500]  What was your bit at the start
[44:39.500 --> 44:40.960]  of this recording? What was that?
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.300]  What was the plan? What was my bit at the start
[44:43.300 --> 44:45.200]  of recording? I'm typically
[44:45.200 --> 44:47.200]  the first one here. And then you were in
[44:47.200 --> 44:49.240]  the chat, just saying like, seven
[44:49.240 --> 44:51.020]  minutes until we record
[44:51.020 --> 44:53.240]  and then you're doing a countdown. What was
[44:53.240 --> 44:54.800]  the point? What was the purpose of that?
[44:55.060 --> 44:57.660]  Here's what I said. I said, hello, castmates
[44:57.660 --> 44:59.260]  and production partners. Oh, that
[44:59.260 --> 45:01.320]  was really you? I am excited to be filming
[45:01.320 --> 45:03.360]  the first two podcast of the year
[45:03.360 --> 45:04.900]  with you. Good tidings.
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.180]  And then I said, getting close to a full crew.
[45:07.260 --> 45:09.100]  I, for one, can't wait because Nick and Eric
[45:09.100 --> 45:10.820]  and Andrew here were just waiting on Gavin.
[45:10.820 --> 45:12.900]  And then when I saw that we had seven minutes to go,
[45:12.960 --> 45:15.080]  I said, seven minute warning. I was just
[45:15.080 --> 45:16.960]  being nice?
[45:17.620 --> 45:18.800]  Polite? I don't know. There's
[45:18.800 --> 45:20.860]  no bit? No, there wasn't a bit.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.820]  I was just like, it's the start of the new
[45:22.820 --> 45:24.500]  year. It's a fresh start. 2021.
[45:25.140 --> 45:26.420]  We're seven days into the year.
[45:26.780 --> 45:28.760]  America's on fire. I was just trying to be like,
[45:28.980 --> 45:30.680]  put some positivity forward. And everybody
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.900]  was just like, nobody would talk to me. And everybody just kept responding
[45:32.900 --> 45:34.780]  with, hmm. Well, it
[45:34.780 --> 45:36.920]  felt like a bit. No. And then I assumed
[45:36.920 --> 45:38.520]  everyone would think that it was me
[45:38.520 --> 45:40.660]  in my Geoff account. Yeah, that's what I thought.
[45:40.820 --> 45:42.560]  So then I just tried to kind of take ownership
[45:42.560 --> 45:44.540]  of it. Because I didn't know
[45:44.540 --> 45:46.620]  what you were doing and it scared me. You're just being
[45:46.620 --> 45:48.240]  positive. I thought it was a whole bit.
[45:48.460 --> 45:50.540]  Oh yeah, I stopped looking after all that. I missed all that.
[45:50.600 --> 45:50.860]  Let's see.
[45:52.160 --> 45:54.360]  I mean, there's not a lot there to look at, but
[45:54.360 --> 45:56.580]  I was expecting it to lead to somewhere
[45:56.580 --> 45:58.200]  and it was just you being nice. No, no, no.
[45:58.300 --> 46:00.400]  The only thing I had planned was
[46:00.400 --> 46:02.300]  to make a joke about how nothing happened
[46:02.300 --> 46:03.760]  has happened yet in the year.
[46:05.240 --> 46:06.380]  So I actually
[46:06.380 --> 46:08.260]  debated on even wanting to talk
[46:08.260 --> 46:10.640]  to you guys about it. We avoid politics
[46:10.640 --> 46:12.100]  on F*** Face because we talk about
[46:12.100 --> 46:14.400]  f***s and faces and farts and butts
[46:14.400 --> 46:16.280]  and stuff. So I don't want to get all political,
[46:16.480 --> 46:18.360]  but I do think it's curious that I'm the
[46:18.360 --> 46:20.280]  only American in the main
[46:20.280 --> 46:22.400]  cast and you're British and you're Canadian
[46:22.400 --> 46:24.000]  and I'd love to get some insights.
[46:24.200 --> 46:26.140]  But then I figured, you know, it's dangerous
[46:26.140 --> 46:28.080]  territory to tread on when our podcast
[46:28.080 --> 46:29.760]  is very much not about that stuff.
[46:30.060 --> 46:31.980]  So then I really didn't have anything.
[46:32.140 --> 46:34.000]  I think you psyched yourself out. Just the
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.020]  ten things I wanted to talk about
[46:36.020 --> 46:37.300]  that I know we'll never get to.
[46:38.780 --> 46:39.960]  But I feel like you
[46:40.600 --> 46:41.980]  have this list, but now you're
[46:41.980 --> 46:43.940]  proud of how much you have on this list and you don't want to
[46:43.940 --> 46:46.180]  spend it. No, I'm happy to. To the point where now
[46:46.180 --> 46:47.900]  when there's a five second
[46:47.900 --> 46:49.920]  silence, you just stay in
[46:49.920 --> 46:52.120]  silence. Yeah. They're not all winners.
[46:52.460 --> 46:53.640]  No, I just...
[46:55.080 --> 46:55.860]  Some of them are.
[46:55.980 --> 46:57.940]  Some of them are. Dude, I did some...
[46:57.940 --> 46:59.320]  I had a first.
[46:59.800 --> 47:01.320]  You want to hear one of them? I'll tell you one of them right now.
[47:01.320 --> 47:03.560]  Yeah, tell us. I'm gonna tell you one right now.
[47:03.600 --> 47:04.760]  Okay, look at this one.
[47:05.060 --> 47:07.340]  How about this one? There was a day
[47:07.340 --> 47:09.240]  during the break, I think it was after Christmas
[47:09.240 --> 47:11.280]  but before New Year's, where I
[47:11.280 --> 47:13.320]  pissed my pants in public and then
[47:13.320 --> 47:15.320]  I came home and while I was talking
[47:15.320 --> 47:17.000]  about it with Emily and Millie,
[47:17.220 --> 47:19.180]  I shit my pants. What? Really?
[47:19.300 --> 47:21.580]  What has happened to your lower half?
[47:21.760 --> 47:23.300]  Yeah, dude, I don't know. We were
[47:23.300 --> 47:25.360]  at a container store of all places
[47:25.360 --> 47:27.460]  walking around and I had to piss
[47:28.280 --> 47:29.760]  and I was like,
[47:29.760 --> 47:31.160]  I gotta go to the bathroom, I'll be right back.
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.520]  And I hate going to the bathroom in public places
[47:33.520 --> 47:35.640]  during the pandemic and stuff because it just feels extra dirty
[47:35.640 --> 47:37.760]  and you feel extra paranoid. But so I ran into
[47:37.760 --> 47:39.680]  there and it was cold so I had a jacket on
[47:39.680 --> 47:41.720]  and my belt got stuck in my jacket
[47:41.720 --> 47:43.500]  somehow and I was trying to get it off
[47:43.500 --> 47:45.680]  and I got close and
[47:45.680 --> 47:47.240]  then my zipper got hung but my dick
[47:47.240 --> 47:49.580]  had the idea that things were happening and so
[47:49.580 --> 47:51.480]  I let a little bit go, I thought,
[47:51.560 --> 47:53.280]  and then I peed and I dried off and everything
[47:53.280 --> 47:55.240]  and then I walked out and I looked down
[47:55.240 --> 47:57.600]  because something felt weird and it was
[47:57.600 --> 47:59.720]  way more than a little bit. It was like
[48:00.500 --> 48:01.860]  I pissed hard
[48:02.200 --> 48:03.960]  in like brown, like tan
[48:03.960 --> 48:05.660]  pants so I had like a big
[48:05.660 --> 48:07.660]  brown piss middle and
[48:07.660 --> 48:09.740]  I just ran and I picked up a box
[48:09.740 --> 48:12.020]  and I just held it at lap height
[48:13.120 --> 48:13.740]  and I fucking
[48:13.740 --> 48:15.700]  walked around the container store until I found Emily and
[48:15.700 --> 48:17.640]  Millie and I was like, we gotta go. And they're like,
[48:17.660 --> 48:19.140]  we're not done shopping. I'm like, alright, well
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.740]  you know, okay. And then they didn't
[48:21.740 --> 48:23.780]  notice that I was holding it weird so I didn't say anything for a while
[48:23.780 --> 48:25.600]  and they were like lollygagging so then
[48:25.600 --> 48:27.040]  eventually I was like, hey,
[48:27.560 --> 48:28.940]  can we get out of here? I
[48:29.580 --> 48:31.600]  had an accident. And they're like, oh no, are you
[48:31.600 --> 48:33.440]  okay? What's wrong? And I was like, I kinda
[48:33.440 --> 48:35.580]  pissed my pants. And they're like, ha ha
[48:35.580 --> 48:37.560]  no really. And then I moved the box and
[48:37.560 --> 48:39.580]  showed and their eyes got so
[48:39.580 --> 48:41.620]  big and they started laughing so
[48:41.620 --> 48:43.040]  loud and then Emily
[48:43.600 --> 48:45.580]  pointed and there were
[48:45.580 --> 48:47.320]  people looking and
[48:47.320 --> 48:49.500]  everybody in the container
[48:49.500 --> 48:51.540]  store from that moment heard the conversation
[48:51.540 --> 48:53.580]  about how I pissed my pants because Emily was
[48:53.580 --> 48:55.440]  repeating everything I said at volume
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.520]  and Emily was not being subtle
[48:57.520 --> 48:59.280]  either. And then I got home
[48:59.280 --> 49:01.480]  and I dried off and
[49:01.480 --> 49:03.460]  then I thought
[49:03.460 --> 49:05.700]  like, uh, that was crazy
[49:05.700 --> 49:07.620]  right? And we were talking about it. And I was
[49:07.620 --> 49:09.380]  like, yeah, that was kind of embarrassing. And then I had to fart
[49:09.380 --> 49:11.620]  and so I moved my leg a little bit. It was one
[49:11.620 --> 49:13.700]  of those, you know how you have a fart that's like a slow
[49:13.700 --> 49:14.960]  bubble that you can feel coming
[49:15.720 --> 49:17.620]  out of you? And then it like comes
[49:17.620 --> 49:19.620]  out of your butt and then it does like a satisfying little
[49:19.620 --> 49:20.900]  pop, a little fart pop?
[49:21.300 --> 49:22.800]  Uh, I had one of those except
[49:22.800 --> 49:24.880]  it was a wet pop. And then so I had to run to
[49:24.880 --> 49:26.780]  the bathroom and then I came back
[49:26.780 --> 49:28.840]  after I had to take a shower and everything and they
[49:28.840 --> 49:31.100]  were like, where are you? And I was like, uh,
[49:31.220 --> 49:32.800]  you guys didn't know, you guys didn't see me shit
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.740]  my pants there? And they just, I guess they
[49:34.740 --> 49:36.820]  hadn't known. So I realized that I outed myself
[49:36.820 --> 49:38.840]  and I didn't have to. I just like the
[49:38.840 --> 49:40.660]  idea of all of your underwear
[49:40.660 --> 49:42.840]  in your drawer, just, oh, they don't know which one's
[49:42.840 --> 49:44.760]  gonna be taken for the day. And the
[49:45.200 --> 49:46.620]  underwear you picked that morning had
[49:46.960 --> 49:48.340]  absolutely no idea what was coming.
[49:48.340 --> 49:50.040]  It was gonna be piss and shit.
[49:50.560 --> 49:52.320]  Also, you were bragging
[49:52.320 --> 49:54.340]  recently on a f*** face that you don't
[49:54.340 --> 49:56.380]  vomit much. No, never. Do you
[49:56.380 --> 49:58.440]  shit and piss yourself more than you throw
[49:58.440 --> 50:00.080]  up? Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
[50:00.380 --> 50:02.380]  I mean, you make it say like
[50:02.380 --> 50:04.360]  listen, I don't want to sound like
[50:04.360 --> 50:06.340]  I piss myself. It was a one
[50:06.340 --> 50:08.500]  time, currently, a one time thing.
[50:08.920 --> 50:10.320]  I definitely shit my
[50:10.320 --> 50:12.460]  pants way more than I would ever
[50:12.460 --> 50:14.380]  pee my pants. I have now officially
[50:14.380 --> 50:16.480]  pissed my pants while I peed
[50:16.480 --> 50:18.380]  the bed one time when I was still
[50:18.380 --> 50:19.800]  married to my ex-wife. And then
[50:20.240 --> 50:22.320]  this time, yeah. So I've
[50:22.320 --> 50:24.480]  peed myself as an adult twice. I have
[50:24.480 --> 50:26.280]  shit myself many times. I've shit myself
[50:27.140 --> 50:28.460]  probably four or five times in the last
[50:28.460 --> 50:30.440]  year. I thought it would get
[50:30.440 --> 50:31.400]  better when I quit drinking, but
[50:32.140 --> 50:34.440]  it's just different shits now. It makes me wonder
[50:34.440 --> 50:36.260]  how many, like in the next decade,
[50:36.680 --> 50:38.620]  how many times do you think you'll shit yourself?
[50:39.180 --> 50:40.180]  And, oh, maybe we should
[50:40.180 --> 50:42.280]  predict it. Maybe we can, like, place bets.
[50:42.520 --> 50:44.420]  I would say I average
[50:45.000 --> 50:45.880]  shitting myself
[50:46.360 --> 50:48.380]  three times a year. So probably 30
[50:48.380 --> 50:50.280]  times in the next decade. That's a lot.
[50:50.360 --> 50:52.260]  Unless things get worse. You know,
[50:52.420 --> 50:54.420]  I'll be 55 by
[50:54.420 --> 50:56.300]  then. I don't imagine things will improve.
[50:57.080 --> 50:58.060]  So, you know,
[50:58.280 --> 51:00.500]  we could probably throw another 5 to 10 shits
[51:00.500 --> 51:01.760]  in there, easily,
[51:02.320 --> 51:04.300]  just to account for, you know,
[51:04.420 --> 51:06.400]  the declination of my body. So what
[51:06.400 --> 51:08.420]  is that, 35? Yeah, I think 35
[51:08.420 --> 51:10.420]  I will shit myself 35 times in the next
[51:10.420 --> 51:11.720]  10 years. How about you, Andrew?
[51:12.140 --> 51:12.540]  Um,
[51:14.240 --> 51:15.700]  maybe twice? Nonsense.
[51:15.800 --> 51:17.920]  Maybe? Enjoy it while you can.
[51:18.280 --> 51:19.240]  Life catches up to you.
[51:19.740 --> 51:21.940]  Your asshole is gonna catch up to you, buddy.
[51:22.340 --> 51:23.620]  Well, is the number raising with you?
[51:23.680 --> 51:25.820]  With age? I just assume in my head
[51:25.820 --> 51:27.420]  that this has been your lifetime average.
[51:27.560 --> 51:29.660]  Well, I think now a lot of it's age
[51:29.660 --> 51:30.640]  before I think it was
[51:32.060 --> 51:32.960]  booze, you know?
[51:33.200 --> 51:35.600]  So I think I wasted my good anal
[51:35.600 --> 51:37.740]  years being
[51:37.740 --> 51:39.840]  shitting my pants because I was drunk.
[51:39.840 --> 51:41.300]  You gave your best years a handicap.
[51:41.440 --> 51:43.700]  I gave my best years to the bottom of the bottle.
[51:44.700 --> 51:46.040]  My best butt years
[51:46.040 --> 51:46.680]  are behind me.
[51:47.380 --> 51:49.760]  It's unfortunate. For me, I feel like
[51:49.760 --> 51:51.840]  shitting and throwing up are directly
[51:51.840 --> 51:53.560]  related to how much I travel.
[51:53.920 --> 51:55.860]  Like, I have shit myself more in other
[51:55.860 --> 51:57.900]  countries than the one I
[51:57.900 --> 51:59.860]  live in. And it's usually just food poisoning
[51:59.860 --> 52:01.560]  or new diet or like new
[52:01.560 --> 52:03.700]  gut climate. You are
[52:03.700 --> 52:05.880]  very, very sensitive
[52:06.880 --> 52:07.880]  to different
[52:07.880 --> 52:09.740]  foods in different locations. I've noticed that about you.
[52:09.820 --> 52:11.800]  You have a very sensitive tummy when it comes to that stuff.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.980]  Not that it stops you from eating, but I've
[52:13.980 --> 52:15.900]  noticed over the course of all of our travel
[52:15.900 --> 52:17.160]  we've traveled together extensively
[52:17.980 --> 52:18.980]  that your tummy
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.720]  definitely is affected by
[52:21.720 --> 52:23.900]  locale a lot. I think there's a direct
[52:23.900 --> 52:25.220]  attack going on there. I have
[52:25.740 --> 52:28.140]  thrown up more from Australians
[52:28.140 --> 52:29.720]  cooking me bad food than
[52:29.720 --> 52:31.180]  I think any other single thing.
[52:31.520 --> 52:33.740]  Every time we do an event in Australia
[52:33.740 --> 52:35.460]  you know, in the past we've gone to
[52:36.160 --> 52:37.560]  cookouts and barbecues and
[52:37.560 --> 52:39.300]  stuff and a bunch of community there and they were
[52:39.300 --> 52:41.380]  cooking up stuff. I throw up
[52:41.380 --> 52:43.540]  every single time from poorly
[52:43.540 --> 52:45.520]  cooked Australian meat and I don't know
[52:45.520 --> 52:47.500]  why. It just is the exact same
[52:48.020 --> 52:49.500]  stuff, surely. It's a dead
[52:49.500 --> 52:51.180]  cow. I have an idea about that.
[52:51.680 --> 52:53.560]  I think that they're poisoning you because
[52:53.560 --> 52:55.100]  you're British and they don't like that.
[52:55.820 --> 52:56.980]  I think that
[52:57.720 --> 52:59.100]  even if it's subconscious
[52:59.100 --> 53:01.380]  I think Australians serve British
[53:01.380 --> 53:03.440]  people bad meat because they don't
[53:03.440 --> 53:05.260]  like them. I also, for the record,
[53:05.400 --> 53:07.580]  I think the entire world does that to Americans
[53:07.580 --> 53:09.380]  as they should. I mean I
[53:09.380 --> 53:11.240]  get it. Listen,
[53:11.440 --> 53:13.220]  I get it. But I think we just
[53:13.220 --> 53:15.200]  it's kind of like Princess Bride, right?
[53:15.420 --> 53:17.140]  Our stomachs are tougher
[53:17.140 --> 53:19.060]  because we get poisoned by way more countries.
[53:20.340 --> 53:21.460]  Whenever I think of
[53:21.460 --> 53:23.380]  Australia now, one of my first
[53:23.380 --> 53:25.180]  mental images is like a hotel
[53:25.180 --> 53:27.040]  toilet with vomit in it.
[53:27.200 --> 53:29.200]  And that's unfortunate because I really like Australia
[53:29.200 --> 53:31.280]  as a place. It's just a shame about
[53:31.280 --> 53:32.640]  all the people trying to poison me.
[53:32.860 --> 53:35.080]  It is a shame. Australia is fantastic, dude.
[53:35.160 --> 53:37.300]  Yeah, I love it. Also, I gotta say, I'm looking at my notes
[53:37.300 --> 53:38.700]  number two on my list.
[53:39.120 --> 53:41.440]  I have to say I was so
[53:42.180 --> 53:42.620]  just
[53:44.060 --> 53:45.020]  overjoyed by the
[53:45.020 --> 53:47.140]  nose flap response I got on social
[53:47.140 --> 53:49.120]  media. It was weeks ago now because
[53:49.120 --> 53:51.160]  we talked about this so long ago, but I mentioned
[53:51.160 --> 53:53.200]  how I can turn smell off and I have nose flaps.
[53:53.340 --> 53:55.240]  I was amazed at how
[53:55.240 --> 53:57.200]  many people, probably more people
[53:57.200 --> 53:59.220]  reached out about this one thing than
[53:59.220 --> 54:01.120]  maybe anything that
[54:01.120 --> 54:02.480]  I've been reached out to
[54:03.120 --> 54:05.140]  for related to Rooster Teeth in years.
[54:05.320 --> 54:06.680]  It was unbelievable.
[54:06.920 --> 54:08.800]  Let me get this straight. You can
[54:08.800 --> 54:11.040]  take in a big, deep breath
[54:11.040 --> 54:13.280]  through your nose, sucking in all that air,
[54:13.600 --> 54:15.260]  but because your flap is shut,
[54:15.360 --> 54:16.460]  you don't smell the air.
[54:17.440 --> 54:19.060]  It's more like where
[54:19.060 --> 54:21.100]  the smell is, there's
[54:21.100 --> 54:23.240]  a valve, or to me it feels like a
[54:23.240 --> 54:25.240]  flap. And I've heard other people say that that's
[54:25.240 --> 54:27.180]  the closest approximation they can have, but
[54:27.180 --> 54:29.040]  they don't think it's a flap. That's like a muscle,
[54:29.220 --> 54:31.320]  I guess. And I just like, you just shut it.
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.760]  Then you just don't smell. Can I
[54:32.760 --> 54:35.160]  have an endoscope? Can I shove it up your
[54:35.160 --> 54:37.120]  nose and you close the flap and
[54:37.120 --> 54:38.780]  I'll see if I can see it? Yeah.
[54:39.120 --> 54:41.180]  Yeah, I think so. I think that'd be a good video once we
[54:41.180 --> 54:43.060]  can, uh, probably
[54:43.060 --> 54:44.500]  the worst thing to do in a
[54:45.700 --> 54:46.880]  COVID pandemic is be
[54:46.880 --> 54:48.200]  messing around in your mucus.
[54:50.280 --> 54:51.000]  Yeah, no,
[54:51.120 --> 54:52.940]  for sure. Anyway, I just wanted to say
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.920]  I've been wildly
[54:54.920 --> 54:56.880]  amazingly disappointed
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.820]  in the lack of sympathy
[54:58.820 --> 55:00.860]  or help or response for my
[55:00.860 --> 55:03.000]  sock problem, but the nose flap response
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.980]  was truly fantastic. So thanks to the
[55:04.980 --> 55:06.860]  audience for that. Also, wanna let you guys know
[55:06.860 --> 55:08.800]  I tried something new the other day and I highly recommend
[55:08.800 --> 55:10.500]  you do it if you ever get a chance.
[55:11.020 --> 55:12.480]  Fart into a hot blow dryer.
[55:12.860 --> 55:13.520]  It's gross.
[55:15.500 --> 55:17.180]  Okay. You know how I
[55:17.180 --> 55:18.800]  blow dry myself dry now
[55:18.800 --> 55:20.660]  when I get out of the shower, like the balls of my butt and stuff?
[55:20.960 --> 55:22.560]  I had a fart in the chamber the other day
[55:22.560 --> 55:24.600]  and so I was like, I've never farted
[55:24.600 --> 55:27.060]  into a blow dryer before. I was already blow drying my butt dry.
[55:27.240 --> 55:28.240]  So I farted into it.
[55:28.300 --> 55:30.360]  It immediately baked it and it became
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.940]  three times worse, the smell. It was hideous.
[55:33.100 --> 55:34.440]  Oh, so it actually changed the aroma.
[55:34.620 --> 55:36.180]  It's like a bathtub fart.
[55:36.300 --> 55:38.740]  Yeah, yeah. It was like, it added a level of
[55:38.740 --> 55:40.540]  spice and depth to the
[55:40.540 --> 55:41.860]  fart that
[55:42.280 --> 55:44.480]  just was new to me. I just, you don't
[55:44.480 --> 55:46.300]  think you can experience body smells
[55:46.300 --> 55:48.560]  from your own body in a different way this late
[55:48.560 --> 55:49.400]  in life. And I was
[55:49.980 --> 55:51.420]  I was excited to find out that
[55:51.420 --> 55:53.500]  there are still things that we can do to ourselves that are
[55:53.500 --> 55:55.400]  interesting and new. Do you get all dried
[55:55.400 --> 55:57.480]  out from blow drying your entire body? Do you have
[55:57.480 --> 55:59.140]  like dry skin now? Absolutely not.
[55:59.380 --> 56:00.900]  Huh. No, not at all. That's ridiculous.
[56:01.280 --> 56:03.420]  I'd think he'd be less flaky, would be
[56:03.420 --> 56:05.580]  my guess. Less flaky? I think so.
[56:05.760 --> 56:07.340]  I think he would be, I think it would be good
[56:07.340 --> 56:09.080]  for the ski. Got a lot of air.
[56:09.780 --> 56:11.480]  Pressurized air. Knock the flakes
[56:11.480 --> 56:13.620]  off. Yeah, but I feel like it would create
[56:13.620 --> 56:15.400]  flakes. Well, I don't know that it would
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.140]  create flakes, but I do think that
[56:17.140 --> 56:19.220]  Andrew is missing out on the
[56:19.220 --> 56:21.120]  idea that a towel acts as an
[56:21.120 --> 56:23.240]  astringent and probably like sloughs
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.320]  off more dead skin than you would blow
[56:25.320 --> 56:27.040]  off with a blow dryer. No, that's fair.
[56:27.120 --> 56:29.100]  Like the friction of the towel. That's a good point.
[56:29.200 --> 56:31.040]  Andrew, are you a passive dryer or
[56:31.040 --> 56:32.920]  an active one? I don't know what that means.
[56:33.140 --> 56:34.860]  What do you mean by that? Like you get out of the shower,
[56:35.340 --> 56:37.000]  do you get the towel and just go to town
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.980]  rubbing it all in everywhere or do you just sort of wrap
[56:38.980 --> 56:41.200]  yourself and drip it dry? Oh, no.
[56:41.360 --> 56:43.060]  We're getting everywhere. Absolutely
[56:43.060 --> 56:45.140]  not. No. I don't want to drip
[56:45.140 --> 56:47.320]  dry. It's terrible. So you're just immediately
[56:47.320 --> 56:48.980]  out of the bathroom. Yeah.
[56:49.120 --> 56:50.660]  As soon as I get out, towel,
[56:51.060 --> 56:53.100]  and then immediately toweling off. We're getting aggressive
[56:53.100 --> 56:55.240]  with the towel. Something that happens to
[56:55.240 --> 56:57.080]  me a surprising amount of times, though.
[56:57.400 --> 56:59.160]  I don't know what it is. Maybe this is just a me
[56:59.160 --> 57:00.460]  problem. I have a feeling it is.
[57:00.980 --> 57:03.360]  Do you ever just forget to like dry your ass?
[57:05.800 --> 57:07.120]  For some reason, I
[57:07.120 --> 57:09.180]  completely miss the ass and then I'll go
[57:09.180 --> 57:11.160]  to put on like underwear and it'll be wet
[57:11.160 --> 57:13.200]  and it'll be gross and I have to take it off. I have to do a
[57:13.200 --> 57:15.020]  re-dry because I just miss that area.
[57:15.820 --> 57:17.280]  If you start
[57:17.280 --> 57:18.800]  blow-drying your body,
[57:19.040 --> 57:21.320]  you'll never have that happen again. I'm telling
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.720]  you. I might have to invest.
[57:23.160 --> 57:25.260]  Gentle warm air up your butthole
[57:25.260 --> 57:27.380]  and on your taint is one of the best pleasures
[57:27.380 --> 57:29.340]  in life. It's like one of the things that makes it great
[57:29.340 --> 57:31.200]  to be a guy, I think. And once
[57:31.200 --> 57:33.140]  you experience it, you will look forward to
[57:33.140 --> 57:34.380]  showers because of
[57:34.380 --> 57:36.920]  what you get to do after. Do I need...
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.900]  Oh, I mean, Andrew, I got a waffle maker.
[57:39.420 --> 57:40.960]  Oh, shit! You get a blow dryer
[57:40.960 --> 57:42.960]  because at Christmas, I couldn't talk about it
[57:42.960 --> 57:45.020]  at the time. Way back in the day when we were talking
[57:45.020 --> 57:46.920]  about it and you were like, you need to get one and I was like, I need to
[57:46.920 --> 57:48.760]  find the right one. I bought Emily that day
[57:48.760 --> 57:50.900]  a Spider-Man waffle maker. I was just waiting for it to come to me.
[57:52.160 --> 57:52.860]  It makes like
[57:52.860 --> 57:54.760]  spiderweb waffles. It's fucking awesome.
[57:54.980 --> 57:56.800]  You haven't left any mix in a plastic
[57:56.800 --> 57:58.860]  bowl? No, I didn't do any of that gross stuff.
[57:59.240 --> 58:01.040]  So, do you think your pleasure from blow-drying
[58:01.040 --> 58:02.880]  your nuts and back and ass
[58:02.880 --> 58:04.800]  and all that stuff, if you got three pieces of wood,
[58:04.900 --> 58:06.980]  cut like two holes in each piece, mounted
[58:07.860 --> 58:09.060]  six blow-dryers,
[58:09.060 --> 58:10.700]  do you think that would increase
[58:10.700 --> 58:13.360]  the enjoyment you get out of that with more blow-dryers
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.120]  or do you think one is enough? I think
[58:15.120 --> 58:17.040]  it might, I mean, it would be
[58:17.040 --> 58:19.080]  super efficient, right? Like you'd be
[58:19.080 --> 58:21.160]  done faster and it might be
[58:21.160 --> 58:22.940]  fun to have like the whole body
[58:22.940 --> 58:24.940]  experience all at once. Yeah. But
[58:24.940 --> 58:26.940]  I think there is something nice about
[58:26.940 --> 58:29.100]  like, the older I get, the
[58:29.100 --> 58:30.880]  more I'm really starting to
[58:30.880 --> 58:32.480]  identify and
[58:33.180 --> 58:34.800]  enjoy and look forward to
[58:34.800 --> 58:36.960]  routine and just like the repetition
[58:36.960 --> 58:38.960]  of doing little things over and over again.
[58:39.340 --> 58:40.900]  Yeah, like picking up your right foot, grabbing
[58:40.900 --> 58:43.060]  the left sock. Yeah, which still
[58:43.060 --> 58:44.440]  you know, happens all the time.
[58:45.240 --> 58:46.980]  But, like, I look forward
[58:46.980 --> 58:48.820]  to standing in front of the mirror and I have a little
[58:48.820 --> 58:51.040]  routine, you know, I don't even like, it's like, it almost
[58:51.040 --> 58:52.960]  becomes like sense memory where you like, I start with my
[58:52.960 --> 58:54.900]  right underarm and then I go across my chest and then
[58:54.900 --> 58:57.020]  I do my beard a little bit. Wettest part of my
[58:57.020 --> 58:59.000]  body, 100% always the beard
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.900]  so it needs like three or four go-throughs and
[59:00.900 --> 59:02.900]  you do your hair a little bit and then let that air dry and then you
[59:02.900 --> 59:05.060]  go down your chest and then you get the balls
[59:05.060 --> 59:07.060]  and you gotta lift your dick up off the balls to get
[59:07.060 --> 59:09.340]  into that area and then you go around
[59:09.340 --> 59:11.140]  your left leg up and then lift my leg
[59:11.140 --> 59:13.080]  up a little bit to go right up in the gooch and get
[59:13.080 --> 59:15.000]  that and then I go down the back of my
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.080]  thighs, that's also nice. Warm
[59:17.080 --> 59:19.060]  air on the back of your thighs is nice. Then also
[59:19.060 --> 59:21.060]  I go up my back, the small of my back
[59:21.060 --> 59:23.280]  that tickles, that's fun, it always
[59:23.280 --> 59:24.960]  is cold and tickly, you know, and then
[59:24.960 --> 59:27.120]  you get to the shins and then I use my right hand to rub
[59:27.120 --> 59:29.220]  my shins while I use my... I'm surprised
[59:29.640 --> 59:30.960]  that... So much detail...
[59:30.960 --> 59:33.040]  the super powerful Dyson
[59:33.040 --> 59:35.200]  hair dryer doesn't have enough
[59:35.200 --> 59:36.980]  oomph to lift your penis up.
[59:37.080 --> 59:39.020]  Maybe it would have enough to lift your penis
[59:39.020 --> 59:39.480]  up.
[59:43.740 --> 59:46.200]  I like that that would be a measurement of the quality
[59:46.200 --> 59:46.840]  of the blow dryer.
[59:48.300 --> 59:49.580]  Can you levitate?
[59:51.000 --> 59:52.100]  It's got 4 inch
[59:52.100 --> 59:53.240]  penis lifting power.
[59:54.900 --> 59:56.140]  I bet I could find a hair dryer
[59:56.140 --> 59:57.760]  that could lift and suspend a penis.
[59:57.940 --> 59:59.940]  Oh, I'm sure. There's probably one on the market
[59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.660]  right now, Target, that would do it.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.600]  You think you could just go to Target and find one?
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.680]  I don't know about that. That's a lot of force and you
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.640]  need like an angle. There's probably be an angle thing too,
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.340]  right? Like you need a good angle for it.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.560]  Dude, I'm fucking blowing through my idea of all the stuff
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.540]  I wanted to talk about. I know.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.620]  Can I just say real fast, before Eric tells us
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.680]  to stop? You do know, like, we have two of these.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.700]  We don't have to get into it and make
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.380]  a whole thing out of it because I have some other stuff.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.500]  Let me just say, I fucking hate
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.580]  computers. I hate personal computers. I hate
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.140]  PCs. I got one.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.540]  Fucking Alfredo put a bunch of work into
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.080]  helping me pick out and order
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.400]  this awesome Origin PC and then it took
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.540]  almost three months to come in
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.500]  and then it came in in a crate
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.460]  and I had to like crowbar it out of
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.400]  the crate and set it all up and turn it on and it goes
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:43.520]  REEEEMMMM
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.460]  REEEEEEMMM
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.540]  and then I had to go take it
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.340]  to Alfredo for a couple days
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.600]  while Alfredo figured out that a fucking
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.560]  heat sink fan cable
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.240]  disconnected and it was overheating
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.520]  and it was a fucking
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.200]  And then, and I haven't even talked to Alfredo since because I felt so bad, shit still doesn't work right.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.820]  And I can't join local networks because Windows 10 is a piece of shit, and I fucking hate PCs.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.020]  So I have like four thousand dollars worth of PC set up right next to me so I can stream and so that Andrew and I
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.780]  can do like, f*** face streams if we want to do and with baseball cards and stuff and all this other nonsense so I can play
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.840]  GTA with you Gavin because the Achievement Hunter guys want me to play GTA a bunch and it's all it's just fucking
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.980]  broken money sitting at my desk.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:29.220]  Fucking hate PCs, and that's f*** face. Thanks for listening.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.740]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you wrap up the show you brought up waffles before Geoff.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:42.020]  with the waffle bar and everything. It was very dangerous and the coffee as well was a very...
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.300]  That was an intense moment.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:49.220]  It's a little... some of the things of the podcast a little dangerous, high stakes,
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.120]  so I recruited, I went back, you remember when we did Fluke Face or when I did Fluke Face
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.980]  I guess and we had the other people playing as us. Yeah, it was when you did the that was the radio play
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.480]  Yeah, we took the transcript of the episode casted people in different roles
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.960]  just with like the danger of everything so I went to the company and I got a stunt double and
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:14.020]  Outros have been deemed too dangerous for me to do there. That's a high-risk scenario after the waffle thing
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:14.980]  I just got to be really safe
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:20.500]  So I got the fluke face me and they're gonna they're gonna fill in for the outro because it's high stakes
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.000]  It's dangerous. Is this the thing you asked Eric for where he said what color? No
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:31.140]  Completely different thing. I'm gonna go you guys can do the outro. It's just a little dangerous. Good luck with it. Have fun
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:38.800]  Sir, Andrew has joined a new discord account called a new pantin. Is this Andrew? Hello, right?
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.560]  Hi, so I'm supposed to be here to a stuntman for Andrew. Is this live?
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.920]  Is what live? I mean, I'm a real live human
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:52.740]  Is that what you're responding to me and the words that I say human are you is your name also Andrew?
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:59.380]  No, no, my name is Evan. Well, we didn't ask for your name. Okay. Why do you sound so much better than Andrew?

[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.600]  No, I'm American. You're American you say interesting good even better import issues. Do you wear pants?
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.820]  Can we please wrap up this episode of this podcast? Can we please do the outro, please?
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.200]  Andrew Evan take take us out. Alright, so that was face
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.640]  congratulations on facing your

[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.720]  It didn't sound like he did anything dangerous there. It's not dangerous at all. Yeah, why are we paying for?
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.800]  Why is this coming out of the show budget? You guys are paying me?
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.380]  Jesus Christ. All right. Well like and subscribe I guess
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:50.640]  Now you say I don't fucking stars leave a star leave a review leave a star the Andrew double didn't do huff the outro
