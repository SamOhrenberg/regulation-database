[00:00.000 --> 00:08.360]  Crystal clear waters, white sandy beaches. Stress doesn't exist here, but back home, an undetected water leak can turn into costly water damage.
[00:09.180 --> 00:14.660]  Moen Flow detects leaks and stops your water main automatically from anywhere, even paradise.
[00:15.880 --> 00:18.500]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:29.970 --> 00:36.890]  Welcome to episode 34 of F*** Face. I am Geoff, and with me are Gavin and Andrew, and
[00:37.870 --> 00:40.290]  What do you guys wanted to talk about Donkey Kong some more you said?
[00:40.510 --> 00:44.110]  No, we're good with Donkey Kong. I think we covered all our Donkey Kong bases, but Eric...
[00:44.630 --> 00:47.430]  Geoff took a real interest in the fact that we talked about Donkey Kong.
[00:47.950 --> 00:48.930]  He seemed really fascinated.
[00:48.930 --> 00:56.390]  No, I didn't. We were having a conversation, which I thought would actually be good for the episode, where Gavin talked about how our...
[00:57.250 --> 01:02.610]  Our... I guess, I don't know what you would call it. Our reviews of our own
[01:03.210 --> 01:06.510]  episodes are better than the episodes when we like argue about what the episodes were like.
[01:06.510 --> 01:10.170]  And I pointed out that I thought that it was a good episode.
[01:10.310 --> 01:16.830]  You guys had the good Donkey Kong conversation, and you took it to be me being snotty or snide and insulting your Donkey Kong conversation.
[01:16.930 --> 01:21.510]  But I thought it was fantastic comedy. I don't know about that. All right. Well now it's worse almost. Yeah.
[01:21.630 --> 01:25.570]  Look, it was a quick story about what we've been up to over Christmas. Just threw it in.
[01:26.510 --> 01:31.110]  Now we're talking about it again. Geoff's clearly unhappy with it. I was not unhappy!
[01:31.690 --> 01:36.850]  I'm... He's like, it's like, I hate you. The more you talk about it, the more it feels like you're really unhappy with it.
[01:37.150 --> 01:39.150]  You're trying really hard to convince us.
[01:40.610 --> 01:47.650]  Should we send Geoff a Nintendo 64 so he can experience the joy of Donkey Kong? I don't want to play it.
[01:47.790 --> 01:54.070]  I'll be honest. I've got something I want to run by you both. I was reading a comment left by one of those
[01:54.850 --> 01:56.990]  pesky comment leavers on our content.
[01:57.750 --> 01:58.890]  Comment leavers, yeah.
[01:59.470 --> 02:01.370]  But I didn't understand it at all.
[02:02.290 --> 02:06.350]  This is the comment. It was on an episode from a few weeks ago.
[02:06.450 --> 02:10.590]  I assume we're talking about bat knobs and stuff. The comment reads as follows.
[02:11.850 --> 02:18.730]  Oh my God, this whole time I, for some reason, was imagining the bat knobs as like the handles. I'm so stupid.
[02:18.930 --> 02:23.130]  They're just the knobs. This is the dumbest revelation I've ever experienced.
[02:23.770 --> 02:27.730]  The person below said, you're not alone. Exact same thing happened to me.
[02:27.730 --> 02:32.830]  I don't understand what they're talking about. I do. I get it. I do too. What does that mean?
[02:33.450 --> 02:37.830]  They thought like you grab the knob. You grab it by the knob, is my interpretation of that thing.
[02:38.310 --> 02:41.550]  Not that the knob is like a support for your hand so it doesn't fly off the bat.
[02:41.830 --> 02:44.310]  I'd assume that's the purpose of the knob, right? Yeah.
[02:44.890 --> 02:49.290]  It's so that when you swing it, your hand hits it and so it doesn't fly out. Yeah, exactly.
[02:49.810 --> 02:53.930]  So they're saying that they thought that you grabbed the knob and that the knob was a name for the handle.
[02:54.970 --> 02:57.630]  I think that's all that is. I don't think that that was that complicated.
[02:57.810 --> 03:00.790]  I still don't understand it, but what did you just say?
[03:01.610 --> 03:11.470]  They think the handle, they thought up until that moment, they thought the handle, you know, the part that you put both hands on that's wrapped in tape, that's skinny, the skinniest part of the bat, that's called the handle.
[03:11.750 --> 03:13.170]  They thought that was the knob.
[03:13.770 --> 03:19.350]  Is that not the knob? They didn't realize the knob is the little door handle at the bottom of it, the little door knob at the bottom of it.
[03:19.350 --> 03:21.370]  I think I think we've now uncovered the problem.
[03:21.730 --> 03:24.350]  What do you mean, Gavin, is that not the knob?
[03:25.550 --> 03:27.150]  The knob is just the knob.
[03:27.470 --> 03:30.290]  The knob is the thing I burned it 5000 times.
[03:30.570 --> 03:33.030]  Yeah. Well, I was imagining the bat knobs being like.
[03:34.490 --> 03:35.590]  A handle and a knob.
[03:35.690 --> 03:36.970]  The end plus a bit of handle.
[03:37.350 --> 03:39.250]  No, the knob is just the knob.
[03:40.630 --> 03:42.330]  Maybe like a couple of inches of handle.
[03:42.710 --> 03:45.790]  No, that's just the bottom half of a bat at that point.
[03:45.870 --> 03:47.890]  That's not it. It's not just the knob. Yeah.
[03:48.330 --> 03:51.170]  You got that. That's the knob and partial handle.
[03:51.450 --> 03:53.210]  So even I didn't know what I was talking about.
[03:53.450 --> 03:54.690]  That's yeah, you were the one.
[03:54.790 --> 03:58.070]  I think you pointed out this comment to be like, look at how dumb these people are.
[03:58.150 --> 03:59.530]  You are the idiot. You have no idea.
[03:59.830 --> 04:04.790]  Well, I was imagining it because when Jack was like, oh, it's like a door handle or like a cabinet knob.
[04:05.150 --> 04:08.210]  There's still a bit of extrusion from the cabinet.
[04:08.350 --> 04:09.590]  It's not just like a button.
[04:10.630 --> 04:11.810]  Well, it depends on the handle.
[04:13.250 --> 04:14.830]  There's all I mean, there are variables to it,
[04:14.830 --> 04:17.410]  but I could see a scenario in which would be the same as like a door handle.
[04:18.430 --> 04:21.090]  Yeah. OK, so there's a difference between the handle and the knob.
[04:21.650 --> 04:23.230]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[04:23.390 --> 04:24.770]  The different. How do you know how far?
[04:24.830 --> 04:26.010]  Where does the handle start then?
[04:26.610 --> 04:27.990]  It's not like it'll starts when.
[04:28.290 --> 04:30.170]  What do you mean where the knob is baffling?
[04:30.590 --> 04:32.470]  They're very different. No, not where the knob.
[04:32.750 --> 04:35.330]  How where does the handle end on the other end of it?
[04:36.490 --> 04:39.130]  What do you mean? Oh, where's the other?
[04:39.410 --> 04:41.250]  It's like it's like where it gets.
[04:41.350 --> 04:44.130]  Yeah, where the bat starts to where the bat starts to flare out.
[04:44.230 --> 04:45.750]  OK, where it starts to flare out.
[04:45.750 --> 04:49.590]  But you can also hold the bat on the flare because it's a bunt and you get a bunt.
[04:49.850 --> 04:50.890]  In that case, I think.
[04:50.910 --> 04:53.990]  Well, you also probably put pine tar on that part of the bat,
[04:54.110 --> 04:55.550]  which is a whole other thing.
[04:55.830 --> 04:59.070]  Well, in that case, I think we should sell bat handles. Why?
[05:00.050 --> 05:02.850]  Because you could still put the logo down the side of it
[05:02.850 --> 05:06.330]  or engrave the knob on the end, but without shipping the whole bat.
[05:07.090 --> 05:08.110]  Do we? It did.
[05:08.270 --> 05:11.770]  Listen, dude, if we're selling bat knobs with handles attached,
[05:11.810 --> 05:13.610]  let's just sell the whole fucking bat.
[05:13.610 --> 05:16.390]  We're selling them 55% of the bat.
[05:16.890 --> 05:19.270]  Like what a weird place to cut it off.
[05:19.550 --> 05:20.130]  It is strange.
[05:20.530 --> 05:21.930]  No, most of the way in the leg.
[05:22.410 --> 05:28.330]  Do we have any idea if one person bought a fucking bat anyway?
[05:28.910 --> 05:31.470]  Oh, like today is today is January 7th.
[05:31.510 --> 05:33.350]  We're filming this. They come out tomorrow.
[05:33.770 --> 05:36.930]  We have no fucking clue if anybody we might be.
[05:37.110 --> 05:41.530]  We might have to go and cut this part out because the bats did so badly
[05:41.530 --> 05:43.510]  that we want to pretend like it never happened.
[05:43.890 --> 05:45.850]  Why would we do it out like it never existed?
[05:45.850 --> 05:46.890]  Because it's so embarrassing.
[05:47.030 --> 05:48.490]  It's even better if it's embarrassing.
[05:48.990 --> 05:50.090]  No, I know. I know.
[05:50.850 --> 05:52.470]  I agree. And I think the bats will sell well.
[05:52.650 --> 05:54.790]  Well, I was just I was just thinking of international shipping.
[05:55.290 --> 05:57.370]  I just think that we should don't trust me, dude.
[05:57.490 --> 06:00.710]  I mailed a bat to Andrew, which I'm assuming he doesn't have yet.
[06:00.810 --> 06:02.090]  No, because he hasn't mentioned it.
[06:02.230 --> 06:07.350]  I mailed a bat to Andrew the day after I gave you your bat, Gavin.
[06:07.590 --> 06:10.750]  Well, they probably delivered the bat to the door that wasn't aligned
[06:10.750 --> 06:11.550]  with where he lives.
[06:11.590 --> 06:13.870]  That is not only a great question.
[06:14.550 --> 06:17.270]  Not only did they do that, but do you know how much it cost me?
[06:17.530 --> 06:21.230]  The cheapest method I could send a fucking bat novelty
[06:21.230 --> 06:23.590]  bat to Andrew was was like 120 bucks.
[06:23.930 --> 06:25.430]  Seriously? Yeah.
[06:25.710 --> 06:26.290]  It's more than that.
[06:26.490 --> 06:28.630]  I think I think all the bats cost that much.
[06:28.690 --> 06:29.770]  I think you got ripped off.
[06:29.870 --> 06:32.930]  No, because it's a fucking irregular size.
[06:33.390 --> 06:35.630]  It's not. It was a whole thing.
[06:35.810 --> 06:36.190]  A tube or something.
[06:36.450 --> 06:40.210]  And I had to they went into a custom cut poster, too.
[06:40.210 --> 06:41.030]  It was a whole thing.
[06:41.250 --> 06:42.770]  It was like it was like with tax and everything.
[06:42.850 --> 06:45.830]  It was like one hundred and seventeen bucks or something. Wow.
[06:46.490 --> 06:48.310]  Just send him a fucking stupid bat.
[06:48.410 --> 06:49.530]  And he doesn't have it yet.
[06:49.630 --> 06:52.810]  A bat handle you could put in an envelope, a bat knob.
[06:52.870 --> 06:53.530]  You could do the same.
[06:53.590 --> 06:56.210]  You could put so many more bat knobs in an envelope compared.
[06:56.730 --> 06:57.310]  I don't think about it.
[06:57.450 --> 06:59.090]  I don't think the knob on its own is a sell.
[06:59.210 --> 07:00.650]  You could lose that in your pocket.
[07:00.930 --> 07:02.510]  I think it's got to be something substantial.
[07:02.990 --> 07:03.950]  You know, it's crazy, Gavin.
[07:04.370 --> 07:05.610]  You know, it's absolutely nuts.
[07:06.190 --> 07:09.390]  I've been waking up every morning and I flip my bat knob
[07:09.870 --> 07:12.750]  and it lands face up.
[07:13.850 --> 07:14.690]  I've changed knobs.
[07:15.450 --> 07:16.550]  I've done everything.
[07:22.110 --> 07:23.290]  Let's while we're talking,
[07:23.350 --> 07:26.710]  while we're talking about old fucking done to death content and jokes,
[07:26.870 --> 07:29.290]  how about let me go down my list.
[07:29.550 --> 07:30.150]  Here's one.
[07:30.610 --> 07:31.550]  Icky shuffle.
[07:31.850 --> 07:34.670]  OK, you you want to talk about the icky shuffle for a second.
[07:35.450 --> 07:38.050]  You guys know that I have a tennis.
[07:38.050 --> 07:39.830]  I take tennis lessons, right?
[07:40.230 --> 07:42.790]  Emily and I have to have a take private tennis lessons.
[07:44.150 --> 07:48.270]  We did. Unfortunately, our tennis instructor is going through
[07:48.270 --> 07:51.550]  some kind of a surgery, and so he's going to be out of commission for six months.
[07:51.750 --> 07:54.690]  So now we're shopping for a new tennis pro.
[07:54.870 --> 07:56.310]  I guess they call him a new tennis instructor.
[07:56.510 --> 07:59.650]  However, the last session I had with him was right before the end of the year.
[08:00.270 --> 08:03.270]  And after it was all said and done, I even forgot.
[08:03.410 --> 08:05.010]  Emily goes, Hey, do you?
[08:05.450 --> 08:07.490]  You know a lot about obviously you're teaching tennis.
[08:07.490 --> 08:08.250]  You know a lot about tennis.
[08:08.310 --> 08:09.690]  And he goes, Well, I certainly do.
[08:09.830 --> 08:12.430]  I grew up wanting to be a professional tennis player.
[08:12.630 --> 08:16.910]  I performed in high school, in college, semi pro.
[08:17.650 --> 08:21.430]  I went to I went I got my degree in kinesiology and I've been sports medicine.
[08:21.790 --> 08:24.550]  And now I don't know if he said sports medicine, but anyway.
[08:24.610 --> 08:28.390]  And so I became a professional tennis instructor.
[08:28.690 --> 08:30.310]  He's like licensed and certified.
[08:30.510 --> 08:32.970]  I think he might have gotten gotten gotten a master's degree or some shit.
[08:33.170 --> 08:35.710]  Anyway, the guy has been living, breathing tennis his entire life.
[08:35.710 --> 08:37.890]  Is this why you have to tell us he plays rugby now?
[08:38.550 --> 08:41.810]  No, no. He's been living and breathing tennis his entire life.
[08:42.450 --> 08:45.590]  Emily asked him, Do you know what the sewing machine is?
[08:45.790 --> 08:46.950]  And he goes, I don't know what that is.
[08:46.990 --> 08:47.950]  And she goes, It's a drill.
[08:48.230 --> 08:50.250]  And then she goes, Will you do this with your feet?
[08:50.350 --> 08:51.810]  Kind of. And he goes, The Icky?
[08:52.470 --> 08:54.190]  And I go, Excuse me? He goes, Yeah, the Icky.
[08:54.270 --> 08:55.110]  That's what we call it. The Icky.
[08:55.490 --> 08:56.370]  Is that what you're talking about?
[08:56.430 --> 08:57.370]  And then he did it.
[08:57.630 --> 08:59.470]  And I go, Yeah, the Icky.
[08:59.550 --> 09:00.930]  He goes, Yeah, like the Icky Woods.
[09:00.990 --> 09:01.710]  It's like the Icky Shuffle.
[09:01.930 --> 09:04.610]  Because I never heard of anybody called the what do you call it?
[09:04.610 --> 09:05.990]  The sewing machine.
[09:06.110 --> 09:07.470]  And I go, Yeah, you've never heard that at all.
[09:07.510 --> 09:10.670]  He goes, Nah, man, I've been doing tennis my whole life and teaching it.
[09:10.710 --> 09:11.350]  And I'm an instructor.
[09:11.510 --> 09:12.750]  And I've never heard that before.
[09:12.830 --> 09:15.770]  Sometimes people call it the Dion, you know, but that's a little different.
[09:15.950 --> 09:18.430]  They're they're miscategorizing it when they call the Icky the Dion
[09:18.430 --> 09:19.530]  because Dion's is a little different.
[09:19.710 --> 09:22.810]  But as far as I know, in all tennis camps
[09:22.810 --> 09:25.650]  and wherever I've seen tennis instructed, we call it the Icky.
[09:26.750 --> 09:30.450]  Is that all just is that whole story just to say that the sewing machine
[09:30.450 --> 09:32.410]  isn't a popularized term for that drill?
[09:32.970 --> 09:35.550]  I just I'm just giving you more information.
[09:35.590 --> 09:39.190]  OK, about a conversation I had because I went out and I talked to an expert
[09:39.190 --> 09:43.390]  and I got I got a machine from an expert as well.
[09:43.510 --> 09:44.290]  So I don't know.
[09:44.670 --> 09:45.670]  Andrew's having none of it.
[09:45.890 --> 09:48.210]  No, there's no all you did.
[09:48.310 --> 09:52.270]  We all agree the sewing machine is not the popular name for that drill.
[09:52.330 --> 09:53.550]  I've never argued that.
[09:53.630 --> 09:54.470]  Here's what we need to do.
[09:54.650 --> 09:57.630]  Let's get your tennis instructor and my tennis instructor to play.
[09:57.750 --> 09:59.510]  I'm pretty sure my tennis instructor is dead.
[10:00.170 --> 10:01.610]  Did I win it, baby?
[10:03.110 --> 10:04.690]  Yeah, yeah, I guess you would.
[10:04.850 --> 10:06.450]  In that case, sure.
[10:07.010 --> 10:08.150]  How do you know that they're dead?
[10:09.210 --> 10:11.150]  I just based on how old they were.
[10:11.250 --> 10:15.450]  Well, I don't I don't remember one of them just vanished and the other one.
[10:16.110 --> 10:18.470]  They just stopped. They just stopped being there.
[10:18.590 --> 10:19.590]  I don't know what happened to them.
[10:19.810 --> 10:23.170]  Do you think it's like it's like a situation like your hairstylist
[10:23.170 --> 10:27.150]  where they they tried to hide from you and retire and move somewhere else
[10:27.150 --> 10:28.210]  and you just haven't found them yet?
[10:28.210 --> 10:31.890]  To continue, I want to I want to have a haircut so badly.
[10:32.250 --> 10:33.950]  I still haven't got my haircut.
[10:34.210 --> 10:37.110]  I need I need COVID to end for that.
[10:37.170 --> 10:40.110]  I mean, obviously, much more important reasons for COVID to end.
[10:40.410 --> 10:41.850]  I'm so excited to get a haircut.
[10:42.690 --> 10:43.250]  I am too.
[10:43.730 --> 10:45.510]  I've thought about just shaving my head again.
[10:46.210 --> 10:47.010]  What's stopping you?
[10:47.470 --> 10:48.270]  Yeah, it looks stupid.
[10:48.590 --> 10:49.690]  Geoff knows it looks dumb.
[10:50.070 --> 10:53.290]  I actually thought he looked kind of kind of charming.
[10:53.670 --> 10:56.030]  Was that with or without your beard on my head?
[10:56.030 --> 11:00.010]  Obviously, minus the pubes stuff, but I actually thought I didn't have the pubes.
[11:00.430 --> 11:02.090]  Or what? Yeah, you did, didn't you?
[11:02.270 --> 11:03.470]  Or underarm hair, whatever.
[11:03.970 --> 11:05.130]  No, you had my hair on.
[11:05.450 --> 11:07.210]  You did. You had a pube mohawk.
[11:08.590 --> 11:10.670]  That was your beard, it wasn't your pubes.
[11:11.150 --> 11:13.010]  Oh, same shit, dude. It's my face pubes.
[11:14.530 --> 11:15.510]  I guarantee you.
[11:15.570 --> 11:18.390]  I guarantee you if I shaved a bunch of my beard and a bunch of my pubes
[11:18.390 --> 11:20.770]  and put them in two different bags, you couldn't tell which was which.
[11:20.770 --> 11:21.710]  I could tell immediately.
[11:22.030 --> 11:23.010]  Are you kidding me?
[11:23.290 --> 11:25.950]  I've looked at your face for years of my life.
[11:26.030 --> 11:26.970]  There's no way.
[11:27.310 --> 11:28.570]  And I've seen your penis.
[11:29.570 --> 11:31.570]  That's true, too. Wiry hair is wiry hair.
[11:33.910 --> 11:36.170]  Also, I'm looking down the list of stuff I still want to talk about.
[11:36.310 --> 11:37.950]  Oh, banana convo fruit conversation.
[11:38.090 --> 11:39.070]  We already did that one.
[11:39.190 --> 11:40.370]  Yeah, we covered it.
[11:40.650 --> 11:42.990]  Can we, before we continue with your list, just quickly,
[11:43.070 --> 11:46.530]  just before we go too far away, we're talking about nuts and the nut thing.
[11:47.370 --> 11:50.510]  Gavin and I, part of our text conversation, we didn't cover all of it.
[11:50.530 --> 11:54.170]  We had the food thing, but then we had another thing we'd like for you to settle.
[11:54.170 --> 11:55.890]  What is a better sequel?
[11:56.210 --> 11:59.090]  The peanut M&M or the SNES?
[11:59.550 --> 12:00.530]  What is a better sequel?
[12:00.950 --> 12:04.570]  What is the better a peanut M&M or an SNES?
[12:04.870 --> 12:08.890]  Yes. We're talking about like best sequels, not movie related.
[12:09.070 --> 12:12.150]  And I said the peanut M&M might be the best sequel of all time.
[12:12.170 --> 12:13.970]  If you like not viewing it in a film context.
[12:14.210 --> 12:17.650]  Your response to me saying that the SNES was amazing
[12:17.650 --> 12:20.430]  because you you just threw out I was blown away.
[12:20.570 --> 12:23.530]  Name a name a better sequel than the peanut M&M.
[12:23.530 --> 12:26.590]  And I just thought, well, you know, the Nintendo was good.
[12:26.730 --> 12:28.150]  The Super Nintendo was great.
[12:30.470 --> 12:33.870]  And Andrew wrote, Super NES is such a great pick.
[12:33.970 --> 12:37.730]  If we were doing a draft of best sequels after you dropped SNES,
[12:37.950 --> 12:40.530]  I'd be like, this guy is out here to win.
[12:41.410 --> 12:42.350]  It's a great pull.
[12:43.430 --> 12:45.170]  I would never think SNES.
[12:45.430 --> 12:46.490]  I love video games.
[12:46.710 --> 12:49.470]  I just I would never go there, but it's such a good pick.
[12:49.470 --> 12:52.490]  Here's why the answer is
[12:53.110 --> 12:57.590]  it is a great pick SNES, but the answer is definitely M&M peanut M&M.
[12:57.670 --> 12:58.350]  Based on what?
[12:58.970 --> 13:00.330]  Well, here's why I'll say
[13:01.390 --> 13:02.550]  they both did.
[13:02.670 --> 13:04.650]  They both did the same job, right?
[13:04.690 --> 13:09.210]  They took a really good and popular item and they improved upon them
[13:09.210 --> 13:09.770]  and they made them better.
[13:09.830 --> 13:10.450]  See, I would disagree.
[13:10.590 --> 13:14.290]  I would say that the original M&M isn't anything to write home about.
[13:14.370 --> 13:15.950]  That was sort of my argument. Not great.
[13:16.270 --> 13:17.150]  No, I think the original.
[13:17.410 --> 13:19.030]  Well, that that makes it even more powerful
[13:19.030 --> 13:22.270]  because the peanut M&M is a fucking home run in candy.
[13:22.390 --> 13:24.390]  It's great. Like the peanut M&M is fantastic.
[13:24.810 --> 13:27.430]  So so by even saying that,
[13:27.530 --> 13:32.770]  that marker makes the accomplishment of the peanut M&M that much greater.
[13:32.950 --> 13:34.750]  But isn't it by your design?
[13:35.270 --> 13:38.310]  It took something that wasn't any good and made it phenomenal.
[13:38.550 --> 13:40.430]  I argue that M&Ms are fine.
[13:40.730 --> 13:42.230]  I'm not a huge fan, but I think they're OK.
[13:42.670 --> 13:44.350]  I wouldn't kick an M&M out of bed.
[13:44.350 --> 13:49.830]  Uh, and so isn't it harder to improve on greatness than something average?
[13:50.610 --> 13:55.830]  Here's why. Here's why the M&M, the peanut M&M is better than the SNES.
[13:56.190 --> 13:58.010]  All right. I think the SNES.
[13:58.090 --> 13:59.770]  I think the SNES. No, I got this.
[13:59.890 --> 14:02.510]  I think the SNES is is foundationally very important.
[14:02.510 --> 14:06.910]  And it was it was it was a part of the rich pastiche of the video game history
[14:06.910 --> 14:10.130]  and super and a very important brick on that wall.
[14:10.450 --> 14:14.070]  But it was a brick on a wall that continues to move
[14:14.070 --> 14:17.170]  and to elevate, and it's been left kind of to the dustbin of history
[14:17.850 --> 14:20.150]  and and and relegated to nostalgia.
[14:20.510 --> 14:24.290]  Right. The peanut M&M is as big as it's ever been.
[14:24.530 --> 14:28.530]  And I project it will continue to be as big going forward
[14:28.530 --> 14:30.450]  for many, many, many years to come.
[14:30.530 --> 14:32.750]  It's still the star of the M&M world.
[14:32.990 --> 14:33.690]  There are others.
[14:33.870 --> 14:35.930]  You know, you could point to the essence from the SNES.
[14:36.010 --> 14:40.590]  You could go to the 64 and the Wii and the GameCube
[14:40.590 --> 14:45.150]  and all the all the other iterations of an SNES.
[14:45.430 --> 14:50.290]  And you could point to peanut M&Ms, peanut butter M&Ms, like mint M&Ms,
[14:50.410 --> 14:54.970]  like whatever all the fucking Cadbury M&Ms, whatever bullshit M&M flavors are.
[14:55.970 --> 14:58.050]  Like all the mashups and stuff. Right.
[14:58.430 --> 15:04.830]  But the peanut M&M is still the fucking it's still the Mike Tyson of M&Ms.
[15:04.930 --> 15:05.930]  It's still at the top of the game.
[15:06.050 --> 15:08.250]  It's still being sold in great quantities.
[15:08.470 --> 15:10.390]  Nobody's going to a store right now buying an SNES.
[15:10.390 --> 15:13.530]  Unless they're buying some little like combo deal for a nostalgia play.
[15:13.590 --> 15:16.890]  But that's more of like a statement on the market and like video games.
[15:17.070 --> 15:20.230]  Like, I know it's a statement on the enduring legacy of the M&M.
[15:20.370 --> 15:22.930]  If the SNES was perfect, they wouldn't have iterated on it.
[15:23.050 --> 15:24.310]  We would still be playing the SNES.
[15:24.470 --> 15:25.290]  But it wasn't perfect.
[15:25.450 --> 15:29.130]  And they can they continue to say you could say that the M&M,
[15:29.310 --> 15:32.570]  the peanut M&M is living in the past and they've not ever been able
[15:32.570 --> 15:33.970]  to replicate the success of it.
[15:34.190 --> 15:38.950]  They've never been able to best it because it's still as great as it ever was.
[15:38.950 --> 15:41.430]  People aren't bored of the peanut M&M.
[15:42.090 --> 15:45.270]  You I guarantee you, if I gave you an SNES, you'd be bored of it in a week
[15:45.270 --> 15:46.850]  and begging to play cyberpunk.
[15:46.850 --> 15:50.590]  You know, you're not going to get like you're not going to get bored of a peanut M&M.
[15:50.770 --> 15:52.550]  It's it is what it is.
[15:52.570 --> 15:53.810]  It's still it's simple.
[15:53.810 --> 15:55.230]  But that doesn't really make any sense.
[15:55.330 --> 15:56.350]  I don't eat a peanut.
[15:56.550 --> 15:58.010]  I don't eat a bag of peanut M&Ms.
[15:58.470 --> 16:00.010]  Because it's still popular.
[16:00.590 --> 16:01.510]  It's still big.
[16:01.570 --> 16:04.990]  It's still doing fucking great numbers and huge success.
[16:05.390 --> 16:08.150]  There's still peanut M&Ms commercials on TV.
[16:08.150 --> 16:12.870]  Famous actors and fucking voice actors play peanuts, play M&Ms on TV
[16:12.870 --> 16:14.850]  and have dumb conversations about eating each other.
[16:15.010 --> 16:15.210]  That's true.
[16:15.510 --> 16:18.290]  The world, my daughter has never seen an SNES.
[16:18.470 --> 16:20.750]  Yeah, but just to counter just to counter that argument.
[16:21.030 --> 16:23.970]  Could you make an argument that maybe there are no consoles
[16:23.970 --> 16:28.030]  beyond the SNES if it isn't what it is like the influence of them
[16:28.030 --> 16:31.410]  being able to carry forward that momentum because of the SNES?
[16:32.190 --> 16:34.710]  But you're kind of taking away the credit of all the other consoles, saying that
[16:34.710 --> 16:37.570]  they they they evolved the platforms.
[16:37.570 --> 16:39.310]  They advanced the technology.
[16:39.570 --> 16:42.650]  No, I think I think you're just I think it's just a but that doesn't happen.
[16:42.770 --> 16:44.250]  I think it's just a poor what it is.
[16:44.770 --> 16:47.130]  I think it's just a poor apples to apples comparison.
[16:47.250 --> 16:50.390]  I mean, I assume the PS2 was a much better financial sequel,
[16:50.530 --> 16:52.990]  but it didn't it didn't change the industry like the SNES.
[16:53.370 --> 16:56.310]  Also, Geoff, if if Andrew's thrown in peanut M&M
[16:56.850 --> 16:59.810]  and I've thrown in SNES, it was between that and Aliens.
[17:00.130 --> 17:01.090]  What would your?
[17:02.310 --> 17:04.750]  What would your sequel be that you would throw into this ring?
[17:05.270 --> 17:06.310]  Well, you said I can't do a movie.
[17:06.310 --> 17:07.470]  Yeah, let's not do movies.
[17:07.950 --> 17:09.130]  Yeah, movies are out.
[17:09.390 --> 17:12.430]  But I would say, you know, that would be my movie if we were picking them.
[17:12.490 --> 17:14.370]  I appreciate the angle you went with, Geoff.
[17:14.470 --> 17:17.650]  Just let me say that you went in a completely different direction to me.
[17:17.690 --> 17:21.150]  It's a measurement of what's better evolving on something that's complete
[17:21.150 --> 17:23.590]  dog shit, which I think the base M&M is terrible
[17:24.090 --> 17:27.710]  or somehow making an improvement on a thing that people absolutely love,
[17:27.790 --> 17:28.730]  which is the NES.
[17:29.350 --> 17:31.530]  I made a better version of a beloved thing.
[17:31.770 --> 17:34.570]  According to you guys both, they made a better version of something
[17:34.570 --> 17:36.210]  that you saw no value in.
[17:36.730 --> 17:38.930]  They created value out of something that you guys saw no value in.
[17:39.390 --> 17:41.250]  I'm assuming you guys like peanut M&M's.
[17:41.350 --> 17:43.230]  Oh, yeah. You wouldn't. Yeah, it's a great candy.
[17:43.830 --> 17:44.350]  That's solid.
[17:44.510 --> 17:48.070]  Well, so I'm going to I'm going to assume that
[17:48.630 --> 17:50.530]  I should take media out of it.
[17:50.630 --> 17:53.670]  Like if we're not doing movies, I shouldn't do a book or a song
[17:53.670 --> 17:55.230]  or an album or anything like that. Right.
[17:55.270 --> 17:56.230]  I should do something weird like it.
[17:56.390 --> 17:58.630]  I think it should be a product, a product.
[18:00.610 --> 18:01.330]  Best sequel.
[18:02.090 --> 18:04.770]  The best sequel product.
[18:05.590 --> 18:08.150]  Oh, man. I'm looking around my house.
[18:11.590 --> 18:12.590]  You know what?
[18:12.890 --> 18:14.490]  This play, you know, had a sequel.
[18:14.950 --> 18:16.670]  I don't think Plato's ever had a sequel.
[18:16.770 --> 18:17.050]  That's pretty.
[18:18.650 --> 18:20.330]  Plato has always just been Plato.
[18:20.450 --> 18:21.850]  Yeah, there's never been a Plato, too.
[18:21.910 --> 18:25.590]  I don't think that's what about that sand shit that is dry
[18:25.590 --> 18:27.190]  when you pull out of the fish tank.
[18:27.390 --> 18:28.570]  Is that Plato, though?
[18:28.570 --> 18:30.930]  Or is that like another company trying to move in on Plato?
[18:30.930 --> 18:32.110]  I don't know. It looked pretty cool.
[18:32.150 --> 18:34.050]  I always saw the ad for it. Never had it.
[18:34.330 --> 18:35.830]  OK, OK, OK.
[18:37.870 --> 18:39.030]  Allow me to.
[18:40.350 --> 18:41.870]  I don't know if you guys will let me do this.
[18:41.990 --> 18:42.530]  I don't know if you guys will.
[18:42.610 --> 18:45.930]  This is either going to be a huge letdown or you're going to blow both of us
[18:45.930 --> 18:46.490]  out of the water.
[18:46.690 --> 18:50.450]  I can't quite. I would say the best sequel.
[18:50.970 --> 18:52.470]  I don't think you guys are going to let this fly.
[18:52.830 --> 18:56.510]  I would say the best sequel is Alexa from The Clapper.
[18:57.850 --> 19:00.190]  What? The Clapper.
[19:00.350 --> 19:02.610]  Clap on, clap off, turn your lights off by clapping.
[19:03.090 --> 19:08.430]  I would say Amazon Alexa is a better is the best improvement upon that of all time.
[19:08.610 --> 19:09.950]  I think that's the best thing.
[19:10.250 --> 19:12.430]  I don't know if they're different things, but
[19:13.570 --> 19:17.510]  do you think it's kind of harsh to call that a sequel to the clapper, though?
[19:17.790 --> 19:19.690]  Yeah, that's what I use my Alexa for.
[19:21.070 --> 19:25.870]  Dude, Alexa, Alexa, Alexa, turn off living room lights.
[19:26.530 --> 19:27.810]  Yeah, it just did it.
[19:28.270 --> 19:30.010]  I don't have a clapper anymore.
[19:30.030 --> 19:30.870]  They do the same.
[19:31.070 --> 19:34.450]  The nuclear reactor is a sequel to the candle.
[19:35.090 --> 19:38.410]  No, they do. They perform the exact same function,
[19:38.770 --> 19:42.890]  but one does it a whole lot cooler and a lot more shit as well.
[19:44.690 --> 19:45.550]  That's my answer.
[19:46.270 --> 19:47.190]  You guys don't have to agree.
[19:47.430 --> 19:47.990]  That's my answer.
[19:48.430 --> 19:50.990]  The Alexa is a much better version of The Clapper.
[19:52.330 --> 19:52.970]  That is.
[19:53.390 --> 19:56.330]  It's like saying the phone is the greatest sequel to the clock.
[19:56.330 --> 19:58.810]  Like, yeah, it tells the time, but look at all the other shit it does.
[19:59.090 --> 20:02.390]  All right. Cell phone is a best sequel to the phone.
[20:02.730 --> 20:04.790]  It's a better little library than a cell phone than a rotary phone.
[20:04.950 --> 20:05.730]  Just take his.
[20:06.890 --> 20:07.690]  I gotta be honest.
[20:07.790 --> 20:10.830]  As funny as these answers are, they're pretty damn good sequels.
[20:11.390 --> 20:12.190]  Yeah, the phone is.
[20:12.290 --> 20:15.010]  I know the Alexa thing is a little bit of a reach, but...
[20:15.010 --> 20:18.570]  The Alexa is so immensely far from The Clapper.
[20:19.130 --> 20:19.950]  What do you like?
[20:19.990 --> 20:21.430]  What would be a sequel to the phone, though?
[20:21.430 --> 20:23.750]  They perform... answer me this question.
[20:24.030 --> 20:25.550]  What does The Clapper do?
[20:25.550 --> 20:26.930]  What is the function of The Clapper?
[20:27.110 --> 20:29.890]  It activates something based on the sound of a clap.
[20:30.730 --> 20:33.750]  What does... does Alexa perform that function?
[20:35.530 --> 20:37.370]  Yeah, but it does a lot of other stuff because it's...
[20:37.370 --> 20:37.790]  Exactly!
[20:38.070 --> 20:38.290]  Different.
[20:38.670 --> 20:43.630]  It took it... it replicated the thing that The Clapper did and then improved upon it.
[20:43.690 --> 20:47.590]  I will... the only criticism I have, Geoff, is that Amazon didn't make The Clapper.
[20:47.930 --> 20:50.770]  If they did, I'd be more aligned with this idea.
[20:50.910 --> 20:51.930]  I'd be more accepting of it.
[20:52.230 --> 20:55.090]  Also, do you think the original production company has to make the sequel?
[20:55.090 --> 20:57.030]  Well, at both of ours...
[20:58.070 --> 20:58.510]  What did you say, bud?
[20:58.510 --> 20:59.030]  That's a great question.
[20:59.370 --> 21:00.790]  Like, do you know anyone who had a Clapper?
[21:02.470 --> 21:04.870]  Wasn't it for, like, insanely wealthy people?
[21:06.110 --> 21:08.250]  That is not what I would assume The Clapper was for.
[21:08.370 --> 21:13.110]  No, I thought it was for trashy people who buy TV gimmicks.
[21:13.650 --> 21:14.830]  Oh, Eric says it was for old people.
[21:14.990 --> 21:15.370]  That's pretty...
[21:15.370 --> 21:15.610]  Yeah.
[21:15.970 --> 21:16.550]  That's pretty good.
[21:16.690 --> 21:18.410]  Like an accessibility light switch.
[21:18.890 --> 21:22.050]  Let's... I tell you what, let's get Eric in here
[21:23.490 --> 21:25.930]  and ask him what he thinks.
[21:26.010 --> 21:29.430]  I was just reading a thread on Reddit today about how people want more Eric in the episodes.
[21:29.630 --> 21:32.410]  They said Eric needs to step up into the content world.
[21:32.430 --> 21:36.570]  I replied to that guy and just said, this rules, because he was so mean.
[21:38.130 --> 21:44.730]  I think... I really think that, like, the phone thing is good.
[21:45.170 --> 21:46.830]  And I don't... But here's the...
[21:46.830 --> 21:50.650]  Here's the issue, is that I don't think it quite has the spirit
[21:51.250 --> 21:53.750]  of what we're trying to get at.
[21:53.990 --> 21:58.270]  Like, there's there's too many steps removed between the phone and the cell phone.
[21:58.910 --> 22:05.310]  That, like, I think that the peanut M&M really is like, man,
[22:05.450 --> 22:08.350]  that's a fucking good answer.
[22:08.590 --> 22:12.230]  Because as a kid, I loved a regular M&M.
[22:12.630 --> 22:15.910]  But fuck, the first time I had a peanut M&M, it was like,
[22:16.350 --> 22:18.930]  oh, this blew the last thing out of the water.
[22:19.950 --> 22:21.650]  What what an incredible sequel.
[22:21.910 --> 22:24.970]  I think it's hard to top a peanut M&M.
[22:25.030 --> 22:27.370]  I really do. I think that's a fantastic answer.
[22:27.470 --> 22:29.170]  I I'm right there with you, dude.
[22:29.190 --> 22:31.130]  I think I think it was the perfect answer initially.
[22:31.470 --> 22:35.310]  I like that you were agreeing with Andrew at one point, but then he kind of
[22:35.310 --> 22:38.390]  I felt like didn't like the way that you were agreeing with him.
[22:38.610 --> 22:40.910]  So he said, yeah, kind of pushing back.
[22:41.090 --> 22:44.030]  He he disagreed with my agreement.
[22:44.090 --> 22:46.610]  So then he switched teams. Yeah, no, no, no.
[22:46.670 --> 22:48.210]  No, I don't. I don't feel like I disagreed.
[22:48.210 --> 22:51.050]  I feel like I was trying to give you credit for the way you process
[22:51.050 --> 22:52.250]  that was different than I did.
[22:52.850 --> 22:56.730]  The you know, in all this, I think I've thought of the best sequel of all time.
[22:56.750 --> 22:57.490]  What's that? I have one, too.
[22:58.310 --> 23:00.650]  Wi-Fi. As opposed to what?
[23:02.190 --> 23:03.970]  A cable Internet connection.
[23:04.550 --> 23:05.070]  Yeah, that's good.
[23:05.910 --> 23:09.110]  The fact that I don't know that that's a secret, a direct.
[23:09.350 --> 23:12.010]  I think that's that's similar to the phone conversation with Eric.
[23:12.150 --> 23:13.310]  I would say you'd have to go.
[23:13.390 --> 23:14.290]  There's too many steps in between.
[23:14.350 --> 23:17.270]  I would say you could go from dial up to cable.
[23:17.870 --> 23:22.350]  Yeah, but the moment I could type to people on MSN in my bed
[23:22.890 --> 23:26.750]  from going from MSN on the computer downstairs, that was it was a game changer.
[23:26.830 --> 23:27.850]  I the biggest one of all time.
[23:28.010 --> 23:32.310]  I don't think that's any different than my clapper Amazon Alexa argument.
[23:32.470 --> 23:34.670]  I think that wasn't I think you can't go people.
[23:35.010 --> 23:36.430]  You weren't there using the clapper.
[23:36.450 --> 23:38.230]  And then the next day, the Alexa came out.
[23:38.270 --> 23:40.550]  That wasn't like one jump to the other.
[23:41.050 --> 23:43.810]  How when was the clapper from like decades ago?
[23:43.810 --> 23:47.890]  Yeah, but like I think but I think Geoff is right where it's like
[23:48.870 --> 23:50.250]  it's the spirit of it.
[23:50.430 --> 23:54.450]  Like there's only one step from peanut like like regular M&M to peanut M&M
[23:54.450 --> 23:57.110]  or Nintendo to Super Nintendo.
[23:57.990 --> 24:01.690]  And I just think that like I agree with you that Wi-Fi was like game changing.
[24:01.790 --> 24:04.370]  I just think that it's too far removed from the initial thing.
[24:04.890 --> 24:06.650]  OK, yeah, I can see that.
[24:06.750 --> 24:09.590]  I don't know. I don't know who to give credit to for this one.
[24:09.650 --> 24:12.010]  Like specific somebody would have had to have done it first.
[24:12.010 --> 24:13.510]  The stuffed crust.
[24:14.130 --> 24:14.950]  Fantastic sequel.
[24:15.410 --> 24:16.350]  Whoever did that for me.
[24:16.770 --> 24:17.230]  Great idea.
[24:17.830 --> 24:19.810]  Great idea. You're crazy.
[24:19.870 --> 24:20.870]  Eh, ridiculous.
[24:21.070 --> 24:22.390]  It looks better in the adverts.
[24:22.970 --> 24:23.770]  No, it's a great.
[24:24.250 --> 24:25.370]  Are you seriously?
[24:25.490 --> 24:28.790]  I'm in a minority opinion here that the stuffed crust isn't a fantastic thing.
[24:29.350 --> 24:29.970]  It's fine.
[24:30.070 --> 24:31.270]  But here's the problem with stuffed crust.
[24:31.510 --> 24:32.790]  And I think Gavin will agree with me here.
[24:33.030 --> 24:35.690]  It's good immediately after it's been cooked.
[24:35.870 --> 24:38.330]  If that thing sits for three minutes, it starts to get.
[24:38.530 --> 24:39.210]  Yeah, it's not great.
[24:39.490 --> 24:41.070]  You got to have it so fresh.
[24:41.790 --> 24:43.050]  I don't know. It's like eating.
[24:43.210 --> 24:44.930]  It's like eating oysters or squash blossoms.
[24:45.110 --> 24:49.070]  It's like oysters, squash blossoms and stuffed crust go bad instantly.
[24:49.410 --> 24:50.210]  Can I ask a question?
[24:50.750 --> 24:51.130]  Go ahead.
[24:51.630 --> 24:53.530]  What in the name of Christ is a squash blossom?
[24:54.690 --> 24:57.550]  So the blossom that falls off of a squash or that you pick off a squash
[24:57.550 --> 25:01.370]  and they're fucking phenomenal, people put like lamb heart in them
[25:01.370 --> 25:04.250]  or like ground beef or like different kinds of things.
[25:04.470 --> 25:05.350]  I don't put lamb heart in it.
[25:05.350 --> 25:05.890]  I think that's gross.
[25:05.970 --> 25:08.790]  But I've cooked them for you, Gavin, because I used to cook.
[25:08.910 --> 25:09.790]  I used to grow squash.
[25:09.790 --> 25:12.190]  And then I would make squash blossoms.
[25:12.310 --> 25:14.530]  And they're they're only good for about like six hours.
[25:14.650 --> 25:17.110]  So you have to like cook them and then immediately or like pull them
[25:17.110 --> 25:17.890]  and immediately cook them.
[25:18.130 --> 25:19.450]  And they taste like I don't know how to describe it.
[25:19.470 --> 25:20.870]  They just taste really fucking good.
[25:21.190 --> 25:22.450]  Edible yellow flower.
[25:23.170 --> 25:24.310]  Yeah, they're just fucking delicious.
[25:24.670 --> 25:28.610]  But they're they're barely the window of them being good is kind of like an oyster.
[25:28.710 --> 25:29.510]  You want to have it immediately.
[25:29.930 --> 25:31.250]  Can I can I ask a question?
[25:31.310 --> 25:33.770]  Sorry. Sorry to the one guy who doesn't like when I chime in.
[25:33.830 --> 25:35.970]  I just wanted to ask a quick question to settle on that.
[25:36.390 --> 25:37.370]  The one guy?
[25:37.730 --> 25:38.930]  Yeah. Just real quick.
[25:39.370 --> 25:42.570]  You were talking about the squash blossom and then edible flower.
[25:42.750 --> 25:44.110]  OK, can you eat any flower?
[25:44.350 --> 25:45.250]  Is like a flower?
[25:45.550 --> 25:49.170]  It's not necessarily like food, but like if you were to like grab a flower
[25:49.170 --> 25:50.970]  and like start eating it, you'd get looks.
[25:51.270 --> 25:53.530]  But try to eat a flower, right?
[25:54.090 --> 25:56.490]  Some are probably toxic, like a mushroom.
[25:57.870 --> 26:00.110]  I think you could eat a single.
[26:00.330 --> 26:01.170]  Well, no, that's absurd.
[26:01.330 --> 26:04.730]  There's definitely there has to be a bad flower out there that will take you down.
[26:04.730 --> 26:07.110]  But I think the majority could eat one of them be fine.
[26:07.310 --> 26:09.030]  Like I wouldn't eat a Venus flytrap.
[26:09.930 --> 26:12.430]  Right. But I would think it would be a rose.
[26:13.250 --> 26:15.530]  No. Or like a daffodil.
[26:17.690 --> 26:18.870]  What? All right. How about this?
[26:19.730 --> 26:22.350]  Well, let's eliminate squash blossoms because we know they're
[26:22.350 --> 26:23.450]  they're flowers for food.
[26:24.030 --> 26:26.130]  What? Think of all the flowers you can think of in your head.
[26:26.190 --> 26:28.490]  What looks like the yummiest flower?
[26:28.550 --> 26:31.710]  I was just saying, what would you assume is the most delicious flower?
[26:31.890 --> 26:32.710]  I think I have an answer.
[26:33.170 --> 26:34.890]  Mmm. Passion flower.
[26:35.210 --> 26:35.930]  They look delicious.
[26:36.370 --> 26:38.410]  Hmm. I think a tulip.
[26:38.550 --> 26:39.490]  I think a tulip would be nice.
[26:39.710 --> 26:41.730]  I think a tulip looks delicious.
[26:41.970 --> 26:44.590]  It comes in different colors, which would give us the idea
[26:44.590 --> 26:46.690]  that it comes in a lot of different flavor and variety.
[26:47.310 --> 26:48.530]  It's the fruit loops of flowers.
[26:49.070 --> 26:50.890]  Yeah, I think it's pretty succinct in size.
[26:51.010 --> 26:53.310]  I think it'd be easy to bite into. I think a tulip.
[26:53.390 --> 26:55.130]  Yeah, I think it looks the most like a fruit.
[26:55.230 --> 26:57.370]  Like it kind of looks like a pepper, a bell pepper.
[26:58.130 --> 27:01.510]  Yeah, I think a I think a tulip is like a solid
[27:03.430 --> 27:07.970]  like eating a tulip is like going to like a thirty dollar a meal restaurant.
[27:08.110 --> 27:08.890]  Like, it's just really good.
[27:08.970 --> 27:09.690]  You expect to get there.
[27:09.850 --> 27:12.750]  I think I think like I think if you wanted to really blow it out of the water,
[27:12.830 --> 27:13.650]  you'd eat an orchid.
[27:13.790 --> 27:15.890]  That would be like an eighty dollar meal.
[27:15.950 --> 27:16.470]  Yeah. Yeah.
[27:16.510 --> 27:17.910]  That'd be like a hundred dollar steak, right?
[27:18.010 --> 27:19.250]  Yeah. Fucking orchid.
[27:19.310 --> 27:21.870]  That would be like we're splurging tonight, honey.
[27:21.910 --> 27:22.630]  We're eating orchids.
[27:22.890 --> 27:23.290]  I agree.
[27:24.110 --> 27:25.830]  That is definitely the top of the flower pyramid.
[27:26.130 --> 27:27.290]  What about like a lily pad?
[27:28.450 --> 27:29.670]  Oh, I think that would be fucking great.
[27:29.670 --> 27:30.670]  It'd be like eating seaweed. Terrible.
[27:30.970 --> 27:32.050]  Gross and watery. Yucky.
[27:32.430 --> 27:33.450]  And it would taste like frog slime.
[27:35.370 --> 27:38.490]  It'd be on the plate, like under the flower that you want to eat.
[27:38.630 --> 27:39.670]  Yeah, exactly.
[27:42.090 --> 27:42.990]  Tires matter.

[29:11.290 --> 29:15.110]  Why not start with the cleanest butthole possible?
[29:15.410 --> 29:17.730]  Talking about starting off on the right foot.
[29:18.230 --> 29:18.870]  Oh, my God.
[29:19.010 --> 29:22.590]  There is nothing better in the world than a bidet anus.
[29:23.050 --> 29:24.370]  And Hello Tushy can provide it.
[29:24.570 --> 29:26.070]  They are the future of toileting.
[29:26.070 --> 29:26.730]  All right.
[29:26.790 --> 29:29.770]  Well, technically, it's also the present and the past of toileting
[29:29.770 --> 29:32.150]  because they've been around, bidets have been around for centuries.
[29:32.670 --> 29:33.990]  But they've been very expensive.
[29:34.150 --> 29:35.030]  They've been very out of reach.
[29:35.150 --> 29:36.010]  And you've had to be
[29:36.910 --> 29:40.050]  honestly in like a monarch in a fancy country,

[30:00.250 --> 30:02.390]  It's got smart spray technology.
[30:02.770 --> 30:04.690]  That's the kind of technology you want to put in a toilet.
[30:05.090 --> 30:06.490]  Do you want dumb spray?
[30:06.770 --> 30:07.710]  Nobody wants dumb spray.
[30:07.810 --> 30:11.590]  You want smart spray, automatic self-cleaning nozzles in everything.
[30:12.070 --> 30:14.550]  Right now, apparently they're only available on the Tushy.
[30:14.770 --> 30:18.130]  But I think we should there's there should be a smart spray revolution.
[30:18.430 --> 30:19.390]  They should be in everything.
[30:19.730 --> 30:21.930]  However, we're talking about Tushy right now.
[30:21.950 --> 30:25.430]  Because with Hello Tushy, you don't even have to wipe your butthole anymore.
[30:25.890 --> 30:30.270]  Just poop, spray, dry, and off you go.
[30:30.690 --> 30:35.770]  Into the sunset, riding on a horse, feeling very clean, very fresh,
[30:36.130 --> 30:39.850]  enjoying the wide open desert air, the skies.
[30:40.670 --> 30:43.370]  Oh, my God, the whole world is out in front of you.
[30:43.470 --> 30:44.050]  Look at the cactus.
[30:44.450 --> 30:47.070]  Look, there's a coyote off howling in the in the wilderness.
[30:47.270 --> 30:50.470]  And you have nothing to worry about because your butthole is clean.
[30:50.470 --> 30:52.050]  Sanitation is simple.
[30:52.530 --> 30:57.370]  It has a schmutz shield that offers easy cleaning and the knobs are naturally
[30:58.010 --> 30:58.490]  antimicrobial.
[30:59.030 --> 31:01.790]  I don't know what microbials are, but I know I'm anti them.
[31:02.370 --> 31:03.610]  Maybe you've already got a Tushy.
[31:03.950 --> 31:05.090]  Is it the 3.0 though?
[31:05.230 --> 31:07.390]  If it's not, I think it's time for an upgrade.
[31:07.670 --> 31:08.690]  Like we said, it's 2021.
[31:09.190 --> 31:10.110]  Let's start fresh.

[31:36.030 --> 31:37.390]  that's going on with my toilet?
[31:38.510 --> 31:44.770]  Oh, boy, I don't think I've seen someone laugh harder over text than Andrew at
[31:44.770 --> 31:45.710]  your bog problem.
[31:45.790 --> 31:46.410]  It made me very happy.
[31:46.990 --> 31:47.550]  It was great.
[31:48.250 --> 31:52.330]  I feel bad, I feel a little bad about it because it's awful, but I mean, it's
[31:52.330 --> 31:52.830]  pretty funny.
[31:53.530 --> 31:57.410]  I've been I've been debating on whether to talk about it and then debating on
[31:57.410 --> 32:01.190]  whether to talk about the genesis of the whole thing.
[32:01.510 --> 32:02.230]  I think you have to.
[32:02.430 --> 32:05.750]  Yeah, I think I think at this point, I'm going to take it from the I'm going to
[32:05.750 --> 32:06.330]  take it from the beginning.
[32:06.590 --> 32:09.450]  And I'm going to start off by saying, because I know she's going to be
[32:09.450 --> 32:13.530]  horrified, my mother will be vindicated throughout the course of this
[32:13.530 --> 32:18.870]  conversation. My mom came to visit in October, November.
[32:20.850 --> 32:21.970]  We were very safe.
[32:22.110 --> 32:23.430]  We got tested before she came.
[32:23.790 --> 32:25.110]  She got tested before she came.
[32:25.170 --> 32:25.910]  We all quarantined.
[32:25.950 --> 32:27.150]  And then she stayed with us for a month.
[32:28.850 --> 32:28.970]  And.
[32:30.190 --> 32:35.570]  OK, sorry, the dog was looking dogs missing his ball, but I can't get it
[32:35.570 --> 32:40.830]  right now. Anyway, so, Henry, buddy, I love you, but you're going to have to
[32:40.830 --> 32:42.330]  wait until a daddy finishes the story.
[32:42.330 --> 32:44.590]  I'm not daddy until stepdad finishes the story.
[32:44.710 --> 32:46.950]  OK, you OK?
[32:47.890 --> 32:49.790]  Yeah, I just can't get the ball for Henry.
[32:49.910 --> 32:50.930]  I'm not going to call him.
[32:51.070 --> 32:51.650]  No, I understand.
[32:51.790 --> 32:52.610]  I understand your dilemma.
[32:52.730 --> 32:53.650]  I'm just OK.
[32:53.690 --> 32:55.130]  I love the dog. I just love the dog.
[32:55.190 --> 32:59.690]  So God, clearly, clearly, he's just like he's like my best friend in the world.
[32:59.890 --> 33:03.850]  Sorry, guys. Yeah, these days we just I spend more time with Henry than anybody
[33:03.850 --> 33:06.270]  else, including my other dog.
[33:08.070 --> 33:08.790]  Anyway, stepdad.
[33:10.450 --> 33:15.370]  So fucking well, I you know, I didn't I wasn't there when they got Henry as a
[33:15.370 --> 33:18.310]  baby or anything, you know, I came in late.
[33:18.690 --> 33:19.790]  Yeah, a puppy. There you go.
[33:19.910 --> 33:22.390]  Dog baby. OK, so here's the story.
[33:22.510 --> 33:23.930]  So my mom comes to save us for a month.
[33:24.330 --> 33:28.790]  She comes in after like the third day and she goes, I am.
[33:29.170 --> 33:30.470]  She just looks mortified.
[33:30.690 --> 33:31.750]  I feel so bad for her.
[33:32.010 --> 33:35.790]  She and she goes, I I'm really sorry, but I I clogged the toilet
[33:35.790 --> 33:36.710]  or your toilets clogged.
[33:36.750 --> 33:37.970]  I didn't do anything. I just peed.
[33:37.970 --> 33:39.370]  And it's clogged.
[33:39.710 --> 33:42.910]  And so I spend like 20 minutes unclogging it.
[33:43.030 --> 33:43.670]  It's just brutal.
[33:43.870 --> 33:45.270]  And I get it unclogged.
[33:45.410 --> 33:47.450]  And I'm like, then it becomes a joke for me.
[33:47.610 --> 33:50.610]  I'm like, well, I just spent 20 minutes unclogging your your
[33:50.610 --> 33:53.090]  the most viscous pee ever, I guess.
[33:53.330 --> 33:55.490]  So I'm definitely bringing this up on the podcast.
[33:55.690 --> 33:57.610]  And my mom was like, please don't talk about this in the podcast.
[33:57.610 --> 33:59.570]  And I was like, she's like this.
[33:59.670 --> 34:00.830]  That's horrible. It's horrifying.
[34:01.990 --> 34:04.890]  And so I didn't I wasn't I was just going to use it as a threat
[34:04.890 --> 34:06.490]  for pretty much the whole time she was here.
[34:06.950 --> 34:08.710]  It's like any time she annoyed me, I'd be like, well,
[34:08.790 --> 34:10.230]  I can always talk about it on the podcast.
[34:11.690 --> 34:13.890]  And then she left and there were no more toilet.
[34:14.010 --> 34:16.470]  There was like it got clogged like one more time while she was here.
[34:16.850 --> 34:18.270]  But it became a joke, you know,
[34:19.410 --> 34:20.230]  in the family.
[34:21.090 --> 34:22.290]  And then my mom left.
[34:22.410 --> 34:25.590]  And then the other day, Millie said that the toilet was clogged.
[34:25.630 --> 34:26.930]  And so I unclogged it for her.
[34:27.590 --> 34:31.410]  And then like another day later, I went in and I just it was I
[34:31.410 --> 34:33.650]  the toilet was fine and I just peed in it.
[34:33.650 --> 34:38.110]  And then I flushed and just brown doo doo water came out
[34:38.110 --> 34:39.770]  as soon as I flushed.
[34:39.770 --> 34:41.950]  And I was like, well, I came back up to clean water.
[34:42.070 --> 34:42.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:42.730 --> 34:46.410]  Came back up to clean water like and I was like, oh my God, I've never seen that.
[34:46.470 --> 34:47.770]  That's like what happens in a movie.
[34:48.110 --> 34:49.390]  This is like Money Pit, you know?
[34:50.050 --> 34:53.790]  And so I call a plumber and he goes in and.
[34:55.790 --> 35:00.310]  He puts a camera in the toilet
[35:00.310 --> 35:03.070]  and in through the escape valve thing or whatever.
[35:04.570 --> 35:06.170]  And my house is pretty old.
[35:07.550 --> 35:09.130]  I think it was built in the 30s, maybe.
[35:09.690 --> 35:13.810]  And so it was built with cast iron pipes, which is not that.
[35:13.970 --> 35:15.190]  I mean, it's uncommon now.
[35:15.310 --> 35:15.990]  They don't use them anymore.
[35:16.050 --> 35:17.110]  It was pretty uncommon back then.
[35:17.370 --> 35:20.110]  My other house that I lived in before here had cast iron pipes as well
[35:20.110 --> 35:21.350]  that I had problems with.
[35:21.590 --> 35:24.230]  Anyway, that's the stuff that you're not supposed to wash to keep the flavor.
[35:25.390 --> 35:26.990]  Cast iron. Yeah, that's the stuff you're seeing.
[35:27.750 --> 35:31.810]  If we were cooking, if we were cooking like jambalaya or something, yeah, you'd want to.
[35:33.750 --> 35:35.670]  Or if you were like seasoning a steak or something.
[35:35.850 --> 35:37.970]  Yeah. However, so I've got these cast iron pipes.
[35:38.070 --> 35:41.190]  One of those pipes, turns out it collapsed
[35:41.930 --> 35:44.770]  and I got to see the video of it and the video looks like something.
[35:44.950 --> 35:45.910]  You mentioned aliens earlier.
[35:46.150 --> 35:49.830]  It looks like something from Alien or Aliens where they're going through the tunnels.
[35:50.010 --> 35:53.810]  It's just like it's like PVC, PVC, PVC, a little bit of metal.
[35:54.130 --> 35:55.490]  Now it's dark and a little rusty.
[35:55.490 --> 36:00.710]  And then the gates of hell have opened up and there's bugs and worms
[36:00.710 --> 36:03.190]  and the fucking side is caved in.
[36:03.590 --> 36:06.970]  And there's just like, it's just it's like a horror show.
[36:07.170 --> 36:09.450]  It's like you. It's just it's hideous.
[36:09.850 --> 36:12.490]  It would, Gavin, you would throw up if you looked at the camera footage.
[36:12.690 --> 36:17.830]  So is it like just cracked open and spewing your fecum all under your house?
[36:18.230 --> 36:19.050]  Under my house. Yeah.
[36:20.450 --> 36:24.610]  Well, anytime we flush it, what happens is it goes down, it hits this obstruction.
[36:24.610 --> 36:29.010]  It goes over it and washes over it and it takes some dirt and stuff with it.
[36:29.070 --> 36:31.470]  But yeah, but then like every once in a while it would build up and back up,
[36:31.530 --> 36:32.390]  which is what happened there.
[36:32.550 --> 36:35.230]  We got that cleaned, but I still have this fucking pipe.
[36:35.530 --> 36:39.270]  Unfortunately, I just had my I spent six months getting my front yard redone.
[36:39.970 --> 36:43.950]  And that was a whole thing and very expensive and went 50 percent over budget.
[36:44.050 --> 36:44.710]  And that was a nightmare.
[36:45.170 --> 36:47.050]  So anyway, the guy goes, all right, you got two options here.
[36:47.090 --> 36:48.370]  He goes, well, it's going to be.
[36:49.570 --> 36:52.430]  It's going to be ten grand to fix your bathroom.
[36:52.950 --> 36:54.150]  Yeah. Ten thousand dollars.
[36:54.250 --> 36:57.650]  And he goes, however, here's the the additional problem I have for you.
[36:57.710 --> 37:02.310]  I think I have a picture that I took of the screen of the dirty toilet.
[37:02.430 --> 37:04.050]  I was going to. Oh, God.
[37:04.710 --> 37:08.510]  Yeah. Let me send that to you guys right now.
[37:09.330 --> 37:10.250]  Oh, boy. It's hideous.
[37:11.730 --> 37:15.870]  OK. Anyway, so he was like, but the real problem is you've got cast iron pipes
[37:15.870 --> 37:17.390]  everywhere under your kitchen and stuff, too.
[37:17.510 --> 37:20.450]  And so you need to have all that replaced because that shit's going to
[37:20.450 --> 37:22.670]  that shit's going to collapse any minute now, too.
[37:23.350 --> 37:27.630]  And so that's got a I got a tunnel thirty five feet under your house to do it.
[37:27.710 --> 37:30.970]  And that's going to be that's forty thousand dollars.
[37:31.790 --> 37:34.290]  So, oh, my shit.
[37:35.610 --> 37:37.290]  No, it's Gavin. It's my shit.
[37:37.410 --> 37:40.370]  And it's all in my front yard, under my front yard, under my house.
[37:40.390 --> 37:43.150]  And it's going to cost ten thousand dollars to fix.
[37:43.890 --> 37:44.770]  Forty potentially.
[37:45.330 --> 37:47.190]  So I got a second and a third opinion.
[37:47.190 --> 37:48.910]  And the second and the third opinion
[37:48.910 --> 37:51.490]  both agree that I may not have to do the rest of the house.
[37:51.570 --> 37:54.850]  The cast iron looks like it looks to be in pretty good shape.
[37:55.170 --> 37:58.090]  So but at a minimum, they're starting like a week.
[37:58.250 --> 38:01.430]  That's going to take at least one to two weeks, probably two weeks,
[38:01.430 --> 38:04.250]  because there's so much construction in Austin right now.
[38:04.830 --> 38:09.010]  Permits are backed up and they have to hire an engineer to come out
[38:09.010 --> 38:11.930]  and inspect the hole because they have to dig a tunnel
[38:11.930 --> 38:15.250]  under my house, through my front yard by hand,
[38:16.170 --> 38:19.090]  then get under the house, then support the foundation and all that.
[38:19.150 --> 38:21.770]  Then they have to have an engineer come in and certify it,
[38:22.150 --> 38:26.090]  that it's safe, that they can work and that the house is safe for us to live in.
[38:26.310 --> 38:29.530]  And then we have to get permits and an inspector has to come.
[38:29.810 --> 38:32.090]  And so it's going to be like two.
[38:32.410 --> 38:34.730]  So I haven't had a toilet now for two weeks,
[38:34.790 --> 38:38.430]  and I'm not going to have it for another three weeks, probably minimum.
[38:38.550 --> 38:41.390]  And then maybe way more if they end up having to replace all the other pipes.
[38:41.650 --> 38:42.590]  It was really funny.
[38:43.200 --> 38:45.530]  I feel terrible, but it's pretty funny.
[38:45.690 --> 38:46.970]  Yeah, it was pretty good.
[38:47.470 --> 38:51.610]  I've never, I've never seen, I agree with Gavin
[38:51.610 --> 38:55.890]  and that it might be the, I could tell Andrew was having trouble breathing.
[38:56.210 --> 38:58.510]  I was crying laughing when I was reading it.
[38:58.610 --> 38:59.250]  It was great.
[38:59.350 --> 39:02.290]  And I was like, I was fucking mad and frustrated
[39:02.290 --> 39:03.830]  and needed a little bit of friendship.
[39:04.030 --> 39:07.490]  And y'all had so much fucking fun.
[39:07.730 --> 39:10.990]  I didn't think, I don't think I was making too much fun.
[39:11.010 --> 39:11.690]  No, not at all.
[39:11.690 --> 39:13.070]  Oh, no, I said I could do it.
[39:13.210 --> 39:14.230]  I said I could do it for cheaper.
[39:14.770 --> 39:15.930]  Yeah, we did that after.
[39:16.150 --> 39:17.250]  You're initially sympathetic.
[39:17.530 --> 39:22.050]  Geoff said it was a $40,000 quote, and I immediately just started laughing.
[39:22.450 --> 39:23.170]  He did.
[39:25.110 --> 39:26.150]  It's so expensive.
[39:26.610 --> 39:28.410]  Oh, you just want shelves.
[39:28.650 --> 39:30.130]  I don't even think your shelves are done.
[39:30.950 --> 39:32.790]  Oh, my God. Are your shelves done?
[39:33.450 --> 39:34.010]  Yeah, shelves.
[39:34.170 --> 39:37.550]  I mean, oh, dude, I'm recording for the first time ever an episode.
[39:37.750 --> 39:40.550]  The last episode in this episode are in the spot, in the place.
[39:40.550 --> 39:42.270]  Dude, congrats, does it feel great?
[39:42.670 --> 39:43.550]  It feels awesome.
[39:43.770 --> 39:45.550]  You got your new office with your broken computer.
[39:46.090 --> 39:47.190]  Yeah, that reminds me.
[39:47.390 --> 39:48.590]  Yeah, my PC doesn't work.
[39:48.690 --> 39:49.190]  That reminds me.
[39:49.670 --> 39:52.390]  Let me know if I sound weird because I didn't really do any testing or anything.
[39:52.510 --> 39:53.710]  I just assumed it would work.
[39:54.550 --> 39:54.970]  Thanks, man.
[39:55.090 --> 39:55.610]  I mean, I did.
[39:56.530 --> 40:01.530]  The very first thing I did was the ad reads, the last batch of ad reads in here.
[40:01.650 --> 40:05.410]  So those already aired, I think, on this week's episode.
[40:05.630 --> 40:08.490]  But yeah, you know, I'm in.
[40:08.570 --> 40:09.130]  I'm finally done.
[40:09.130 --> 40:15.650]  By the way, the fucking library got finished and it was nine days later that my toilet broke.
[40:16.090 --> 40:18.050]  So I had nine days.
[40:18.210 --> 40:22.150]  I had nine days of of of like beautiful, perfect house harmony
[40:22.690 --> 40:25.890]  before I found out that they're going to rip up the entire front yard.
[40:26.010 --> 40:27.190]  I just spent six months.
[40:27.450 --> 40:30.030]  How did that not come up in the inspection, by the way?
[40:30.370 --> 40:32.270]  It didn't. It didn't.
[40:32.270 --> 40:33.910]  It didn't come up in the inspection. It's a great question.
[40:34.110 --> 40:35.410]  I even went back and I fucking looked.
[40:35.410 --> 40:40.430]  I have like a 55 page report on the inspection and it didn't register any issues.
[40:41.030 --> 40:42.730]  How do I add a fucking?
[40:43.050 --> 40:44.330]  I'm not sure. Yeah, I don't see this picture.
[40:44.430 --> 40:44.870]  Where'd you put it?
[40:44.950 --> 40:47.590]  I keep sending it just as compressing every time I try to send it.
[40:47.790 --> 40:49.530]  So I keep trying to resend it.
[40:50.250 --> 40:55.130]  I was just thrilled as well by like the concept of a $40,000 toilet flush.
[40:55.610 --> 40:59.850]  It's the most expensive singular flush that I'm aware of outside of like
[41:00.370 --> 41:03.990]  there's that McMillions documentary and the guy flushed a million dollar game piece.
[41:03.990 --> 41:05.910]  So that's, I guess, a million dollar flush technically.
[41:06.130 --> 41:09.030]  But as far as people I know, I've never heard of a more expensive flush.
[41:09.650 --> 41:10.550]  Forty thousand. That's brutal.
[41:11.330 --> 41:14.010]  Oh, it is. It's the nightmare of my life.
[41:14.230 --> 41:15.410]  Yeah. Yeah. So what's going to be?
[41:15.770 --> 41:19.090]  What do you think will happen after this pipe nightmare is over?
[41:19.210 --> 41:19.650]  What will be the next thing?
[41:19.650 --> 41:20.930]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[41:20.990 --> 41:22.750]  I'm going to text this to you two idiots.
[41:23.030 --> 41:24.650]  And then you put it to the discord.
[41:24.830 --> 41:28.030]  So for some for some reason, I cannot get it to the discord.
[41:28.310 --> 41:30.510]  What is the most expensive flush you've ever had, Gav?
[41:30.910 --> 41:33.290]  Any prices? It wasn't my flush, it was my mom's flush.
[41:33.770 --> 41:37.430]  Well, I mean, if I've eaten a fancy meal, does that count?
[41:37.890 --> 41:40.670]  Nah, I guess. Yeah, sure. That counts.
[41:41.190 --> 41:43.410]  Yeah, I once had like a...
[41:43.410 --> 41:44.490]  It's a different question.
[41:44.490 --> 41:46.650]  A really nice sushi meal in Vegas.
[41:47.830 --> 41:49.990]  OK. So that was probably it.
[41:50.290 --> 41:53.430]  But but once again, you know, it's like that I don't want to keep it.
[41:53.870 --> 41:54.870]  No, fair enough.
[41:55.190 --> 41:56.270]  And it doesn't retain its value.
[41:56.830 --> 41:58.890]  Oh, oh, what is that?
[41:59.270 --> 42:01.410]  That's the inside of my PVC pipe
[42:01.410 --> 42:05.230]  where all the poop and mud and rusted metal and stuff.
[42:05.350 --> 42:06.230]  Oh, it looks like.
[42:06.710 --> 42:11.270]  Oh, it looks. Yeah, it looks like it looks like chocolate cornflakes.
[42:11.550 --> 42:14.150]  It looks like it looks like what it is, Gavin.
[42:14.230 --> 42:17.870]  It's it's shit and rust and dirt and mud and bugs and shit.
[42:17.990 --> 42:19.310]  And definitely feces.
[42:19.690 --> 42:21.450]  It's weirdly so gross.
[42:21.450 --> 42:23.050]  It's not gross to look at for me.
[42:23.370 --> 42:25.450]  No, the first one looks like a steak.
[42:26.570 --> 42:27.050]  Yeah.
[42:27.050 --> 42:33.590]  Hey. You wouldn't eat a box of this, Gavin.
[42:34.270 --> 42:36.130]  Oh, tasty treat.
[42:39.050 --> 42:41.110]  Is this the best sequel to cornflakes?
[42:42.530 --> 42:45.850]  No, this might be the worst sequel of all time.
[42:46.750 --> 42:48.810]  Oh, oh, you know what's a good sequel?
[42:49.350 --> 42:53.790]  What? The sequel Chex Mix from Chex cereal.
[42:55.150 --> 42:56.150]  Are they connected?
[42:56.550 --> 42:58.070]  Yeah, I never made that.
[42:58.310 --> 43:00.910]  I think so. I think Chex Mix would be the sequel to Chex cereal.
[43:00.990 --> 43:02.190]  They took Chex and they made it better.
[43:02.290 --> 43:02.710]  They made it more.
[43:02.810 --> 43:05.410]  They made it something new and different using the same ingredients
[43:05.410 --> 43:06.190]  and then added to it.
[43:06.410 --> 43:10.850]  Maybe Crunchy Nut is the best sequel to cereal with cornflakes.
[43:12.430 --> 43:15.210]  Mm. Oh, oh, fucking Captain Crunch.
[43:15.310 --> 43:18.950]  Crunch Berries is an amazing sequel to Captain Crunch,
[43:19.090 --> 43:20.870]  which is an amazing cereal.
[43:21.750 --> 43:23.550]  It's not really mainstream enough.
[43:23.670 --> 43:24.670]  I don't think that's what that's not.
[43:24.670 --> 43:27.030]  You don't think Captain Crunch is mainstream?
[43:27.630 --> 43:30.170]  Nah, it's sort of North America, mainly.
[43:30.450 --> 43:31.990]  Oh, I guess so.
[43:32.610 --> 43:34.490]  I mean, to me, Captain Crunch is like
[43:35.090 --> 43:38.470]  it's like a top three cereals of all time.
[43:38.950 --> 43:40.150]  I guess that it just doesn't.
[43:40.410 --> 43:41.850]  I guess the captain doesn't have any.
[43:42.510 --> 43:44.290]  His rank doesn't have his jurisdiction.
[43:44.570 --> 43:46.670]  Yeah, that's a shame.
[43:47.310 --> 43:50.610]  I realized that the mac and mac and cheese stands for macaroni yesterday.
[43:51.170 --> 43:52.170]  That was the thing I realized.
[43:52.710 --> 43:54.130]  What do you think it was, Macintosh?
[43:54.730 --> 43:56.150]  I never just thought about it.
[43:56.250 --> 43:57.390]  I put it in Mac.
[43:57.850 --> 43:59.990]  Yeah, I just I never questioned it.
[44:00.470 --> 44:03.590]  I finally asked myself the question of what is the mac and the mac and cheese
[44:03.590 --> 44:05.990]  and macaroni was an immediate realization.
[44:06.450 --> 44:08.970]  I just never pieced the two together until yesterday.
[44:09.530 --> 44:11.170]  You know what? I had a similar thing.
[44:11.790 --> 44:15.850]  I had a I had a similar thing the other day where I was riding my bike
[44:16.350 --> 44:19.370]  downtown in down like that in Austin.
[44:19.370 --> 44:22.330]  We have a lake that like Town Lake that runs through the city
[44:22.330 --> 44:26.830]  and there's like an extensive amount of bike and hiking trails and shit around it.
[44:27.070 --> 44:29.630]  And so I was on the river, on the lake, riding my bike.
[44:29.690 --> 44:33.710]  And I drove by my bike right by the Chive, you know, that place that
[44:34.530 --> 44:39.190]  that the website that that sure they whatever they post pictures
[44:39.190 --> 44:41.970]  of chicks and jokes and memes and stuff or whatever.
[44:42.330 --> 44:44.210]  And they have like this crazy facility.
[44:44.350 --> 44:45.150]  I've actually been there once.
[44:45.150 --> 44:48.970]  I went there with with Meg, actually, because I did a photo shoot there
[44:48.970 --> 44:52.590]  and they had like a whiskey bar and a fucking slide to go from the second floor
[44:52.590 --> 44:53.130]  to the first floor.
[44:53.210 --> 44:56.750]  And it's every like every tech bro thing you could imagine in the world was there.
[44:57.550 --> 44:59.350]  But it was I can't believe you went through with it.
[44:59.450 --> 45:03.050]  They were, you know, I lost the bet or something or agreed to it.
[45:05.730 --> 45:09.470]  But anyway, so I rode my bike by there and I think about that day
[45:09.470 --> 45:12.270]  every time I ride by there, how awkward and weird that day was.
[45:14.610 --> 45:16.090]  Yeah, it was just fucking bizarre.
[45:16.270 --> 45:18.790]  And now none of those people from the Chive wanted me anywhere near
[45:18.970 --> 45:23.010]  that building, and they just had to fucking stomach me
[45:23.010 --> 45:26.030]  because I went with your girlfriend who insisted I'd be a part of it.
[45:26.090 --> 45:26.810]  It was very funny.
[45:27.570 --> 45:28.790]  She didn't think you'd go through with it.
[45:29.270 --> 45:30.070]  Yeah, no, I did.
[45:31.450 --> 45:32.770]  And I'm up for anything, dude.
[45:32.970 --> 45:35.410]  But anyway, I was riding my bike by it and then it hit me and I looked at it
[45:35.410 --> 45:37.870]  and I was like, oh, that's that place where the Chive is.
[45:38.330 --> 45:40.190]  And then and I have never understood that name.
[45:40.310 --> 45:42.050]  Like, why would you name? I like chives.
[45:42.430 --> 45:43.230]  I think chives are great.
[45:43.450 --> 45:44.430]  I love my baked potatoes.
[45:44.930 --> 45:48.610]  But like, I never understood where the genesis of that name came from.
[45:48.610 --> 45:49.550]  And then it hit me.
[45:49.630 --> 45:50.970]  I bet it's the Chive.
[45:51.330 --> 45:54.130]  I bet it's short for archive because it's like an archive of memes
[45:54.130 --> 45:55.570]  and photos of hot chicks and stuff.
[45:55.770 --> 45:57.730]  And I bet it was never meant to be the Chive.
[45:57.830 --> 46:00.450]  I bet the Chive came from the mispronunciation of Chive.
[46:01.030 --> 46:01.650]  Is that what it is?
[46:02.070 --> 46:04.110]  I don't know. In my head, that's what it is.
[46:04.470 --> 46:06.230]  Well, you didn't even bother to check?
[46:06.470 --> 46:09.490]  You thought, I'll just tell it on the podcast and look it up later.
[46:11.450 --> 46:15.270]  Did Andrew check that Mac stands for macaroni or did he just assume?
[46:15.390 --> 46:18.410]  No, it's just so obvious that my point was that mainly it was
[46:18.410 --> 46:19.890]  I think it's pretty obvious.
[46:20.290 --> 46:22.990]  I think it's pretty obvious that no one in the right mind would name something
[46:22.990 --> 46:24.230]  the Chive. No, I'm going to.
[46:24.550 --> 46:26.730]  Do you think they'd more likely name it the Chive?
[46:27.150 --> 46:28.090]  I don't know.
[46:29.190 --> 46:29.730]  I'm going to look.
[46:30.690 --> 46:33.790]  Where, Andrew, where did
[46:34.490 --> 46:37.650]  did the name of the Chive come from?
[46:37.910 --> 46:39.030]  I'm just guessing.
[46:39.970 --> 46:41.390]  It's already done. I put it in the thing.
[46:42.490 --> 46:44.770]  Oh, oh, I was wrong.
[46:47.290 --> 46:49.170]  Ah, that makes even more sense.
[46:49.270 --> 46:50.510]  It was like a play off the onion.
[46:51.190 --> 46:56.970]  I guess I will say that the the Chive being named after the onion is funny,
[46:57.090 --> 47:00.770]  but I don't know how, how I don't know that's broad enough to make sense.
[47:00.910 --> 47:03.550]  I think I think my my answer makes more sense than theirs.
[47:04.870 --> 47:08.490]  I think it would have been interesting if it turned out to be true.
[47:08.790 --> 47:09.950]  Well, who's to say what's true?
[47:10.170 --> 47:11.750]  Have you told anybody this?
[47:12.150 --> 47:12.830]  No, just you guys.
[47:13.490 --> 47:17.150]  OK, I had the thought of my bicycle for like it's the fact
[47:17.150 --> 47:18.850]  you didn't check this at all is baffling.
[47:18.990 --> 47:21.050]  Yeah, why would I make sense in my head?
[47:21.770 --> 47:23.190]  Because you're saying it is a fact.
[47:23.690 --> 47:24.730]  You don't say it was a fact.
[47:24.890 --> 47:25.950]  I never said it was a fact.
[47:26.070 --> 47:30.130]  I said, I bet I feel like you presented it in a way of like
[47:30.130 --> 47:33.370]  you also had an insight into something and you're like,
[47:33.510 --> 47:35.530]  I thought it was going to be like, I guessed it right.
[47:35.610 --> 47:36.090]  I nailed it.
[47:36.130 --> 47:39.610]  But it's just an unfinished fuck if I ever had insight.
[47:42.110 --> 47:46.350]  I had a I had like a deconstructive word moment where I was talking to someone
[47:46.350 --> 47:49.490]  about something that I reacted to at the time.
[47:49.550 --> 47:51.870]  But then I was thinking about how I felt about it later.
[47:51.870 --> 47:53.650]  And I was like, yeah, I was telling them all this stuff.
[47:53.730 --> 47:54.850]  And they're like, oh, why didn't you tell me at the time?
[47:54.850 --> 47:58.350]  And I was like, well, I just I'm just giving it more of like a retroactive
[47:58.350 --> 48:00.650]  perspective on it. And I was like, oh, no, there's a word.
[48:00.710 --> 48:01.850]  There's already a word for that.
[48:02.110 --> 48:04.850]  This retrospective is exactly those two words smashed together.
[48:05.590 --> 48:08.870]  But I'd never I'd never considered that that word is those two words.
[48:09.030 --> 48:09.590]  I also have a question.
[48:09.590 --> 48:11.410]  I haven't verified that. That's probably true, though.
[48:11.550 --> 48:15.850]  Yeah, well, until you verify it for all I know, mac and cheese stands for
[48:16.730 --> 48:17.890]  McIlzeo and cheese.
[48:22.290 --> 48:25.110]  Famous Italian chef McIlzeo.
[48:25.110 --> 48:29.030]  I like that I said that I learned what mac and cheese meant a day ago.
[48:29.090 --> 48:30.910]  You somehow told a dumber story.
[48:31.490 --> 48:33.430]  I really that's what I'm here for, man.
[48:33.990 --> 48:37.670]  What, that I came up with a fake that a fake etymology for
[48:37.670 --> 48:45.030]  a dumb website that that was I just said that's like I just what I thought up on my bike ride
[48:45.030 --> 48:46.590]  when I was riding my bike, I was like, what?
[48:46.690 --> 48:47.490]  Well, that's a stupid name.
[48:47.590 --> 48:50.570]  What? Why? Where would they could where would they arrive at?
[48:50.790 --> 48:52.090]  Like the kind of company?
[48:52.870 --> 48:53.870]  Oh, fuck. This doesn't.
[48:55.270 --> 48:56.790]  Say good things for Rooster Teeth, though,
[48:57.170 --> 48:59.770]  let's say the kind of company that would name themselves something that's stupid,
[48:59.770 --> 49:03.390]  but then also gets to have a building in downtown Austin that's all to their own
[49:03.390 --> 49:05.130]  on a river like it just doesn't make any sense to me.
[49:05.210 --> 49:07.290]  But then we named a company Rooster Teeth.
[49:07.290 --> 49:09.750]  And we also had a building downtown in Austin.
[49:09.850 --> 49:10.970]  I know. Shut up.
[49:15.510 --> 49:18.570]  I've got to try and find a list of what would that be?
[49:18.630 --> 49:22.410]  A list of stuff that is obvious, but a lot of people don't know.
[49:22.470 --> 49:23.810]  Like I feel like mac and cheese.
[49:24.550 --> 49:26.090]  Most people know that's macaroni.
[49:26.190 --> 49:27.210]  What am I looking for?
[49:27.570 --> 49:29.570]  I want to find a big list and present them to Andrew.
[49:29.770 --> 49:30.930]  I think I just need a journal.
[49:31.390 --> 49:33.830]  I just need to write a journal down of all these thoughts.
[49:34.070 --> 49:34.550]  Read it one day.
[49:34.650 --> 49:35.410]  Yeah, but the thing is,
[49:35.410 --> 49:38.030]  you probably don't know a lot of what you don't know.
[49:38.390 --> 49:39.130]  No, that's true.
[49:39.190 --> 49:42.390]  But I come across things pretty frequently of like, I didn't.
[49:43.130 --> 49:45.890]  The teenage thing was like a fucking that was crazy.
[49:46.410 --> 49:49.690]  You need to be writing everything down so that we can put it in the zine.
[49:50.270 --> 49:52.630]  I also think potentially once we're past the zine,
[49:52.650 --> 49:55.830]  or maybe this could be a part of the zine, we need to release a book.
[49:55.970 --> 49:58.050]  You know how like some successful TV shows
[49:58.050 --> 50:01.450]  they'll eventually release the scripts as like a hardback or something.
[50:01.730 --> 50:03.270]  We need our texts
[50:04.070 --> 50:07.350]  like a collection of our best text conversations as a book.
[50:07.450 --> 50:09.250]  At some point, we just need to have more conversations.
[50:11.090 --> 50:13.030]  Because it's gold. It's good stuff.
[50:13.550 --> 50:17.450]  I feel like if we reread our conversation where you're criticizing me
[50:17.450 --> 50:20.510]  about only making knobs out of the same material out of wood,
[50:20.870 --> 50:24.190]  knowing that you didn't know what a knob was, it'd be interesting to reread that
[50:24.190 --> 50:26.550]  because you're very much against me in that conversation.
[50:27.070 --> 50:28.670]  And you just didn't know what a knob was.
[50:28.850 --> 50:29.870]  You mistook the knob for that.
[50:30.430 --> 50:32.390]  Yeah, that's a great point, Andrew.
[50:32.390 --> 50:36.730]  Because Gavin's idea of what a knob was would have produced so many fewer knobs.
[50:36.910 --> 50:38.450]  Yeah. Yeah.
[50:38.530 --> 50:42.370]  But if I was the one suggesting we sell the knobs,
[50:42.450 --> 50:45.510]  then technically I was the one who was right and everyone else was wrong.
[50:45.770 --> 50:48.150]  I don't know how that works.
[50:48.210 --> 50:51.090]  It's a lot of some gymnastics there as a leader.
[50:51.090 --> 50:53.350]  Yeah. Yeah, I think you might be right.
[50:53.770 --> 50:54.610]  I think you might be. Yeah.
[50:54.730 --> 50:58.890]  I like who would you even tell like to say, I want bats that are cut in half,
[50:58.890 --> 51:02.270]  but not like not in the middle, not in the middle.
[51:03.290 --> 51:06.190]  Like most of the I want like 30% of a bat.
[51:06.430 --> 51:08.430]  Could you please make me a bunch of 30%?
[51:08.430 --> 51:12.030]  It would probably be like the bottom 20, 20% is what I was considering selling.
[51:12.470 --> 51:13.330]  You know what you need?
[51:13.830 --> 51:15.270]  You need to partner to fit the logo on it.
[51:16.230 --> 51:19.370]  Yeah. I feel like the only thing that you can like work with those
[51:19.370 --> 51:21.470]  the like the bat mug things.
[51:21.610 --> 51:23.450]  I feel like you want the other half of that.
[51:23.510 --> 51:25.010]  I feel like that's perfect for what you're doing.
[51:25.010 --> 51:28.030]  Yeah, like that's the part.
[51:28.170 --> 51:30.930]  They don't want the offcuts of the bat mugs. Exactly.
[51:31.810 --> 51:33.550]  Maybe we could reach out to that company.
[51:34.010 --> 51:37.150]  Yeah, they although they certainly they don't make a full bat for those.
[51:37.250 --> 51:38.510]  And the cut. What's the dumbest?
[51:38.930 --> 51:40.710]  What's the dumbest thing you could sell?
[51:40.910 --> 51:43.030]  A bat knob is pretty fucking dumb.
[51:43.330 --> 51:45.910]  I mean, a wetsuit gut is pretty dumb because it's expensive.
[51:46.090 --> 51:47.710]  Oh, I forgot about the wetsuit gut.
[51:48.390 --> 51:50.550]  So you could have. Yeah, that was a good one. Keep your.
[51:50.630 --> 51:53.170]  And I think that there'd actually be a use to them.
[51:53.190 --> 51:54.230]  And that would be the mouse mat.
[51:54.230 --> 51:56.710]  I think a wetsuit gut would make a good mouse mat.
[51:58.270 --> 52:00.370]  You know what? You know what I think would be dumb to sell?
[52:00.730 --> 52:03.870]  What? A coffee mug handle.
[52:04.350 --> 52:06.890]  Oh, so we decided
[52:07.550 --> 52:11.410]  we decided the best sequels, the dumbest product to sell.
[52:11.530 --> 52:13.330]  Yeah, it's like, what are you gonna do with a coffee mug handle?
[52:13.750 --> 52:17.430]  Did you see those defective Ubisoft mugs that were great?
[52:17.550 --> 52:19.130]  Where the handle was in backwards?
[52:19.430 --> 52:20.610]  The handle was in the cup.
[52:21.630 --> 52:22.690]  It's a great product.
[52:22.690 --> 52:24.590]  That's a fantastic dumb product.
[52:24.630 --> 52:25.790]  That can't be real.
[52:26.390 --> 52:27.490]  No, they make like it was.
[52:27.590 --> 52:29.110]  I think it was done on purpose.
[52:29.390 --> 52:29.790]  I think you could resell.
[52:30.270 --> 52:34.570]  You could resell broken coffee mug handles as drawer pulls.
[52:35.670 --> 52:36.170]  Eric, find them.
[52:36.170 --> 52:37.170]  They're like ceramic.
[52:37.470 --> 52:38.330]  How do you affix them?
[52:39.370 --> 52:40.230]  There we go. Thank you.
[52:40.350 --> 52:41.650]  Look at how great that is.
[52:41.890 --> 52:43.310]  That's a great dumb product.
[52:45.610 --> 52:47.670]  That's. So wait, that wasn't done to be funny?
[52:48.370 --> 52:52.530]  No, they didn't present it as it being done to be funny, but it's so funny.
[52:52.530 --> 52:53.950]  You feel like it has to be on purpose.
[52:54.530 --> 52:57.290]  They said that was a genuine bug in their like processing.
[52:57.730 --> 52:59.210]  But it's so funny.
[53:00.330 --> 53:01.710]  That's yeah, that's funny.
[53:01.830 --> 53:02.610]  That is really funny.
[53:02.750 --> 53:04.790]  I'm mad we can't sell a face inward mug.
[53:06.290 --> 53:09.610]  Yeah, the they fucking stole our idea that they had first
[53:09.610 --> 53:10.890]  and then that we came up with after.
[53:11.790 --> 53:12.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:13.490 --> 53:14.230]  Sons of bitches.
[53:15.890 --> 53:17.030]  I mean, we could sell that, right?
[53:18.350 --> 53:21.150]  It'd be like making them would be the weird thing, but they don't own mugs.
[53:21.150 --> 53:22.650]  Ubisoft doesn't own mugs.
[53:23.050 --> 53:29.210]  Do you think I've come across noticeably stupider in the last two episodes?
[53:31.150 --> 53:33.570]  I think you're tripping up on stupider.
[53:34.010 --> 53:36.130]  I think I'm in trouble.
[53:37.550 --> 53:38.710]  I think you're doing.
[53:38.910 --> 53:39.650]  It's been two episodes.
[53:40.550 --> 53:41.510]  What do you say?
[53:42.510 --> 53:44.690]  I'm at the end of my rope. I'm a lizard.
[53:45.210 --> 53:48.050]  Maybe today was the wrong day to do two episodes back to back again.
[53:48.130 --> 53:50.230]  This fucking country, this fucking year.
[53:51.130 --> 53:52.330]  I'm losing my mind.
[53:52.350 --> 53:53.570]  It's twenty four in a new year.
[53:53.670 --> 53:54.950]  I'm sitting. I got a car.
[53:54.950 --> 53:58.190]  I got a fucking car buried under my house sitting on itself.
[53:59.870 --> 54:01.230]  That's what I'm excited about.
[54:01.370 --> 54:04.170]  I never said that when they dig up your entire yard
[54:04.170 --> 54:06.530]  and it turns out your house is on a burial ground.
[54:06.690 --> 54:08.390]  That's what I'm really excited, dude.
[54:08.630 --> 54:11.150]  What I'm excited about is when they dig up my yard
[54:11.150 --> 54:12.970]  and they find that I have foundation problems
[54:12.970 --> 54:15.130]  and then they're going to be like, Oh yeah, your house is sinking.
[54:15.690 --> 54:17.330]  Yeah, this is way worse than we thought.
[54:17.330 --> 54:20.350]  The plumbing, but I'm excited to hear a dude go.
[54:21.130 --> 54:24.290]  I'm excited to hear a dude with a hard hat, lean on a shovel
[54:24.290 --> 54:26.670]  with a fucking sweat stain around his neck and go,
[54:27.050 --> 54:28.210]  I'm going to be honest with you, buddy.
[54:28.870 --> 54:30.190]  Plumbing's the least of your problems.
[54:30.630 --> 54:31.850]  That's what I'm excited to hear.
[54:32.530 --> 54:33.670]  Plumbing's the least of your problems.
[54:33.770 --> 54:35.330]  You do everything in the wrong order somehow.
[54:35.630 --> 54:38.950]  I like that you've done the yard over a completely useless dead pipe.
[54:40.150 --> 54:42.010]  That was the first thing I did in the house.
[54:44.750 --> 54:45.810]  Maybe you should move.
[54:45.830 --> 54:46.990]  That's not true. That's not true.
[54:46.990 --> 54:49.970]  The first thing I did in the house was replace the entire air conditioning system
[54:49.970 --> 54:53.390]  and some of the ducting when the when the AC went out
[54:53.930 --> 54:55.490]  in the second week of living here.
[54:55.670 --> 54:57.610]  That was that was the very first thing I did.
[54:58.050 --> 54:58.750]  I feel sorry for you.
[54:58.850 --> 55:02.650]  It's it's it's unfortunate how funny it is, because I do feel sorry for you.
[55:02.890 --> 55:05.630]  It's just all your problems are happening in the wrong order
[55:05.630 --> 55:08.630]  and are obscenely expensive one after another.
[55:09.490 --> 55:13.390]  Yeah, well, you know, thank God for insurance and savings and stuff.
[55:13.490 --> 55:16.510]  And and I'm just fingers crossed that I am only going to replace
[55:16.510 --> 55:19.050]  my bathroom pipes and not the kitchen as well, because then it's like,
[55:19.730 --> 55:24.430]  you know, I'll have to be, you know, I'll have to I'll have to sell you my new car.
[55:26.650 --> 55:28.430]  I think you should just do the kitchen.
[55:29.170 --> 55:30.230]  I go back and forth, man.
[55:31.030 --> 55:32.490]  I don't know. I'm on the fence.
[55:32.910 --> 55:34.250]  You probably redo the fences, too.
[55:34.690 --> 55:36.930]  I got shit. I'm on the fence is fucking solid.
[55:37.030 --> 55:38.550]  I'm on the fence and I got shit.
[55:38.650 --> 55:41.130]  I got to jump into shit on the left or piss on the right.
[55:41.210 --> 55:42.150]  I don't know which way to jump.
[55:42.530 --> 55:43.370]  They both suck.
[55:43.630 --> 55:46.310]  If it's you one after the other, I think you go piss first.
[55:46.310 --> 55:49.270]  Based on your track record, I think you go piss and then you shit.
[55:49.530 --> 55:54.830]  I am not going to be happy if pissing my pants becomes like a routine thing.
[55:54.990 --> 55:58.870]  Isn't it weird that you can't shit without pissing unless you're shitting your pants?
[55:59.150 --> 56:01.530]  Yes. Yes. Yes.
[56:02.470 --> 56:04.010]  How fucking annoying is that?
[56:04.430 --> 56:05.510]  Well, I think that's better.
[56:05.550 --> 56:07.430]  Is it annoying? Yeah, I think it's a good thing.
[56:07.510 --> 56:09.750]  I think it's just that you can't shit with a nice failsafe.
[56:09.990 --> 56:11.330]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[56:11.870 --> 56:14.050]  I. Hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[56:14.050 --> 56:15.310]  Andrew and Gavin, huh?
[56:16.130 --> 56:19.670]  Since the last episode, have either of you had a baby or gotten married?
[56:20.550 --> 56:23.790]  No, not yet. No, unfortunately, no, no.
[56:23.890 --> 56:24.770]  OK, just want to make sure.
[56:25.150 --> 56:27.750]  Apparently, that's a question we need to ask between episodes
[56:27.750 --> 56:28.850]  because stuff comes up.
[56:29.130 --> 56:31.910]  We should also ask, is Andrew wearing pants or underwear?
[56:32.590 --> 56:33.470]  Underwear. Yeah, absolutely.
[56:33.850 --> 56:37.010]  Have you ever done a fuck face in Winnie the Pooh mode?
[56:38.210 --> 56:39.250]  That's a good question.
[56:39.350 --> 56:43.190]  No, I don't think so, because we didn't record when my my ankle was really bad.
[56:43.670 --> 56:44.790]  Andrew? No, I don't think so.
[56:45.090 --> 56:48.070]  Yeah. Would you be willing to? Of course.
[56:48.690 --> 56:49.610]  What if we did?
[56:50.170 --> 56:54.630]  What if we did an all Pooh episode where we're all dressed
[56:54.630 --> 56:58.250]  and we all just have fucking shirts on and no one just dicks out?
[56:58.670 --> 57:00.250]  I don't I don't know.
[57:00.530 --> 57:01.710]  Well, I don't know what that adds.
[57:02.510 --> 57:03.030]  I don't know that.
[57:03.190 --> 57:04.090]  Maybe we call it the Donna.
[57:04.350 --> 57:05.490]  Maybe don't go Pooh, because that's it.
[57:05.570 --> 57:07.970]  We do like we all like the Donald Duck episode.
[57:08.330 --> 57:09.050]  The Donald Duck.
[57:09.110 --> 57:11.710]  We're just not like maybe it'll be funny or maybe we'll be more relaxed.
[57:11.750 --> 57:12.510]  We'll be freer.
[57:12.510 --> 57:15.770]  Maybe maybe we'll find it to be bonding.
[57:16.010 --> 57:18.730]  Maybe it'll be horrifying and we'll agree that we it was so bad
[57:18.730 --> 57:20.230]  we never release it and don't talk about it.
[57:20.530 --> 57:21.410]  But it'd be fun to find out.
[57:21.570 --> 57:25.130]  I don't feel like it'll have an impact on anything, but I'm willing to.
[57:25.790 --> 57:28.910]  Dude, I would be a different person if I was sitting in this chair
[57:28.910 --> 57:32.430]  right now with my balls like melting to the leather chair.
[57:33.090 --> 57:37.210]  I guarantee you it would change my mood, whether it would elevate it or lower it.
[57:37.290 --> 57:37.670]  I don't know.
[57:38.010 --> 57:41.070]  Donald Duck was created in 1934.
[57:41.070 --> 57:43.050]  So maybe for episode 34.
[57:43.550 --> 57:44.430]  That's this episode.
[57:44.850 --> 57:45.950]  Oh, shit.
[57:46.450 --> 57:47.210]  You know what?
[57:47.310 --> 57:48.730]  We got to wait for another hundred.
[57:50.830 --> 57:51.630]  You know what?
[57:52.330 --> 57:53.990]  I think you might be onto something, Geoff.
[57:54.930 --> 57:55.390]  Why is that?
[57:55.610 --> 57:56.230]  Did you take your pants off?
[57:56.650 --> 57:59.030]  Yeah, because initially I felt no different at all.
[57:59.150 --> 58:00.030]  Maybe 20 seconds.
[58:00.270 --> 58:02.370]  And it definitely there's a different vibe now.
[58:02.730 --> 58:03.570]  What are you talking about?
[58:04.010 --> 58:05.090]  I don't. I'm Donald Ducking.
[58:05.470 --> 58:06.430]  Describe the vibe.
[58:07.210 --> 58:08.570]  It I don't know.
[58:08.570 --> 58:11.130]  It feels there's an uneasiness that didn't exist before.
[58:11.290 --> 58:12.410]  I feel more vulnerable.
[58:12.790 --> 58:14.970]  I feel it is episode 34.
[58:15.110 --> 58:17.270]  I'm going to have to feel like you're flying by wire.
[58:17.390 --> 58:19.670]  Right. Well, yeah, it feels a little dangerous.
[58:20.230 --> 58:21.490]  All right. Here's what I'm going to do.
[58:21.730 --> 58:22.390]  Because Millie's home.
[58:22.590 --> 58:23.790]  I'm going to have to tell her now.
[58:23.990 --> 58:26.070]  I'm going to have to tell her not to come into the room for a second.
[58:26.130 --> 58:27.070]  I'll be right back. Hold on.
[58:27.110 --> 58:28.270]  Have her like feed the dogs.
[58:28.690 --> 58:29.330]  I'll be back.
[58:30.490 --> 58:31.890]  Hey, I'm going to take my pants off for a minute.
[58:42.950 --> 58:43.830]  All right.
[58:43.870 --> 58:46.270]  I hope I'm not the only one because all my balls are already stuck.
[58:48.110 --> 58:48.990]  Oh, yeah.
[58:49.370 --> 58:51.430]  What's your chair situation?
[58:51.650 --> 58:56.690]  Because I'm on a I'm on like a nice fabric chair that I honestly my main emotion
[58:56.690 --> 58:59.850]  that I'm feeling new is that I feel like I'm going to have to wash the chair
[58:59.850 --> 59:02.890]  and I'm uncomfortable putting my bare ass on this chair.
[59:03.350 --> 59:07.130]  Here's I feel comfortable because this nobody else sits here
[59:07.130 --> 59:10.370]  except for Emily sometimes, but she's she's dealt with worse for me.
[59:11.450 --> 59:15.410]  And it's a cheap chair I bought on like Wayfair or something.
[59:15.490 --> 59:17.170]  It's like imitation leather office chair.
[59:17.210 --> 59:22.090]  It was just like it was just meant to be like a stopgap for the pandemic,
[59:22.090 --> 59:24.170]  you know, because I didn't ever want to have an office here.
[59:24.750 --> 59:26.510]  So I was in the I was already going to get rid of it.
[59:26.510 --> 59:27.370]  So I'm not going to clean it.
[59:27.390 --> 59:29.870]  I'm just going to leave I'm just going to leave my butt juice on it.
[59:29.970 --> 59:32.530]  And it's your balls and knob touching the chair.
[59:33.150 --> 59:34.350]  My ball. Let me see.
[59:34.470 --> 59:37.930]  My balls are they were kind of trapped by my legs.
[59:37.970 --> 59:39.290]  Hold on. Yeah, my dad.
[59:40.090 --> 59:42.530]  Because I don't have because I've just pulled mine down.
[59:42.710 --> 59:45.650]  It's kind of compressing my legs into themselves.
[59:45.890 --> 59:47.950]  Yeah, I put my turn lifting my
[59:49.390 --> 59:50.770]  genitalia up onto my legs.
[59:50.990 --> 59:52.350]  All right. So I was in the same situation,
[59:52.350 --> 59:55.090]  but I just have put my pants all the way down to my ankles
[59:55.090 --> 59:57.330]  and it's allowed me to be out a little bit more.
[59:58.830 --> 01:00:03.230]  My balls are super resting on this, on the on the chair.
[01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:04.450]  It's nice. Andrew, what about you?
[01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:07.830]  It's warm. I'm kind of like a front chair sitter.
[01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.990]  So it's kind of I got a little bit of a dangle going.
[01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:12.250]  Oh, you're a front chair sitter.
[01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.670]  You're like you're perched. Yeah.
[01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.090]  I'm kind of perched right now. I got a little bit of a dangle.
[01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:18.410]  I got a sweet dangle going.
[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.190]  Are your balls dangling off the edge?
[01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:23.030]  Oh, I'm dangling as well.
[01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.710]  Gavin, Gavin. Eric is also a front chair sitter.
[01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.810]  Yeah. Gavin, dangle.
[01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:32.270]  All right. I'm dangling. I'm dangling now, too.
[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:32.930]  It's cool.
[01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:34.590]  Nick isn't editing these, right?
[01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:36.330]  He's going to be on break for this one, too.
[01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.990]  He's going to be away.
[01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.830]  Yeah, he's going to be on break for this.
[01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.270]  OK, great. Eric's my new favorite.
[01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:41.970]  Nobody tell Nick.
[01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:44.650]  OK, so now it's breezy.
[01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.590]  It's cold. My balls are hanging down.
[01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.510]  Wow.
[01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.590]  I got to say, which one of your balls hangs lower than the other?
[01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.850]  Do you guys have a ball, like one ball that's always hangs down?
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:00.290]  One step away from being like a medical exam over the podcast format.
[01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:01.810]  Over the medium of podcast.
[01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:04.050]  It's my left ball, for sure.
[01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:06.830]  My left ball's got a lot more hang in it.
[01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.870]  I think mine used to be the left, but then it got stapled down or up, I guess.
[01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:14.490]  You had a ball problem before, right, Gavin?
[01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.090]  Like, didn't it get in a knot or something?
[01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:17.430]  What happened to your balls?
[01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:19.090]  Yeah, it twisted around.
[01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.570]  It twisted around. Torsion, testicle torsion.
[01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:23.630]  I had that happen recently.
[01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.730]  I think I had that happen.
[01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:26.250]  It was like, what was your...
[01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.390]  Was it like just moving anywhere extremely painful?
[01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:32.610]  I mean, that happened a few times, but when it actually went full torsion.
[01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.610]  I mean, there's no way you wouldn't know that you have it.
[01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.010]  You'd have to go straight to hospital.
[01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:40.570]  Like it became like the size of an orange.
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.610]  Well, you said it was kind of black, too, right?
[01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.170]  Like you were a couple hours from losing it. It was going to die.
[01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:46.610]  Yeah, well, I didn't see it.
[01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:48.390]  It was they had to cut it open to see it.
[01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:52.310]  But Jesus. Yeah, I think I had half recently.
[01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.050]  I had a half torsion scenario.
[01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:54.870]  It was no fun.
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:58.170]  Yeah, I guess I had like a kinked line to the point where it would sort of
[01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:01.330]  partially twist and then cut off blood and then it would untwist.
[01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:03.230]  And eventually it just went all the way.
[01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:05.150]  And it was no good.
[01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:05.850]  That's alarming.
[01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.930]  I don't know. That was the worst Christmas day ever.
[01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:10.090]  It was my Christmas.
[01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:11.790]  Dude, I was watching something.
[01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:14.970]  You talk about how like how quickly your balls like, because when you said
[01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.910]  like you were like an hour or two from your ball dying.
[01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:18.770]  Yeah, that's what the surgeon said.
[01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.330]  Yeah. So I was watching this.
[01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.630]  I was watching this thing the other day where Dr.
[01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:27.370]  Drew was watching videos of anus is prolapsing.
[01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:29.470]  Oh, man. And like importance and stuff.
[01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:32.650]  And he was saying that that's super dangerous, too, because that tissue,
[01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.170]  like if it gets kinked at all, your anus will die real fast
[01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.350]  and you could just lose your whole butthole to a prolapse.
[01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:39.470]  Very, very dangerous.
[01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:41.990]  Don't ever prolapse your butthole if you can avoid it.
[01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:42.870]  That sounds terrible.
[01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:44.130]  Yeah. Blood flow.
[01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.290]  Very important to all of those things.
[01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:47.890]  Well, I was half torsion.
[01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.110]  It was a lot of pain moving anywhere.
[01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:54.250]  And so I tried to correct it by doing a ball flip like I did a twist of it.
[01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:55.670]  I didn't know which way to twist, though.
[01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.110]  I guess I just guessed I took it.
[01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.090]  It was a bold move.
[01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:01.370]  It's like when you don't know where to spin the twist ties.
[01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:04.910]  I just grabbed it and I did a counterclockwise roll.
[01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.190]  Immediate relief.
[01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.130]  But it must have been agony to touch it, though, at first.
[01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.030]  Oh, it was awful.
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:14.010]  It was a lot of pain, but it was even worse moving anywhere.
[01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:15.710]  So I was like, I just got to correct this.
[01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:17.570]  I don't know which way I got to turn it.
[01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:18.890]  I think this is a turn situation.
[01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.170]  I did a half flip.
[01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.930]  I probably would have thinking back on it.
[01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:26.170]  I think I could have corrected it with small vibrations.
[01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.930]  Really? Hmm. Yeah.
[01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:32.490]  Maybe just like rustling the entire sack would have naturally turned it back.
[01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:35.990]  What do you think would have happened, Andrew, if you had turned it the wrong way?
[01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:36.750]  Nightmare.
[01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.610]  I'm probably in a hospital.
[01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:40.450]  I think you'd have blacked out.
[01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:42.330]  I think I would have blacked out immediately.
[01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:43.490]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:45.910]  But my pants are back on, by the way.
[01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:47.090]  I didn't dangle for very long.
[01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:48.390]  I'm still hanging.
[01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:49.750]  I'm not dangling anymore.
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:51.770]  I'm sitting back in the seat because of posture.
[01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:54.850]  But my balls are fucking cozy between my legs.
[01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:57.490]  Overall, I didn't I didn't enjoy the experience.
[01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.110]  Yeah, I don't think this is great.
[01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:01.790]  I didn't say at a great time.
[01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:03.130]  It's just it's a need.
[01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:05.970]  Both times I Donald Duck that it was a need.
[01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.570]  Look, I'm not I don't know what y'all are talking about.
[01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.390]  This is awesome.
[01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:11.090]  In a chair. I don't know.
[01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:12.830]  I'm not hating this at all.
[01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:14.610]  Eric, how are you feeling about your dick being out?
[01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:17.790]  I think this has been a great episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.450]  I want to thank everyone for tuning in to episode thirty four.
[01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:24.990]  And I want to say thank you for everyone who made the bats such a success.
[01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:26.390]  Wow. Incredible stuff.
[01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:28.050]  Don't forget to subscribe.
[01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:32.650]  Leave us a five star rating and we'll see you next time on another episode.
[01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:34.630]  He's lying to you.
[01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:36.230]  He doesn't know how the bats did.
[01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.030]  They're not out yet.
[01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.210]  It's only January seven.
[01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:41.570]  You think sitting with your dick out is the best sequel to sitting normally?
[01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.390]  No, definitely not.
