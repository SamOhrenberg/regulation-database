[00:00.000 --> 00:04.460]  You don't technically need this car. You say that out loud to yourself.
[00:04.880 --> 00:08.640]  You say, I have no space. You say, eh, I'm just looking.
[00:09.060 --> 00:13.940]  Then you click. Then you zoom in on photo number 87 and whisper, oh no.
[00:14.360 --> 00:16.900]  Then you text a friend, the one who always enables you.
[00:17.240 --> 00:21.960]  You say to yourself, this is the last one, knowing it is not.
[00:22.460 --> 00:27.560]  You don't need this car. But maybe, just maybe, this car needs you.
[00:27.560 --> 00:30.060]  Bring a trailer. It's never just a car.
[00:31.460 --> 00:33.700]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:45.370 --> 00:46.910]  Boy, do we have a lot to talk about today.
[00:47.170 --> 00:49.150]  Do we? I don't know. We got a few things.
[00:50.210 --> 00:53.090]  Uh, I'm going to say a list of shit that I don't want to get dropped, alright?
[00:53.210 --> 00:54.670]  Because I want to make sure we talk about it. Why are you yelling?
[00:54.890 --> 00:58.590]  I don't, I'm not yelling. No, he's kind of quiet to me, Gavin. I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:58.670 --> 01:00.910]  Oh, really? Yeah. But he's screaming down my a-hole.
[01:01.430 --> 01:02.770]  No. No. Oh my god.
[01:03.150 --> 01:06.130]  Alright, well, step one, uh, the first thing I want to talk about is how,
[01:06.570 --> 01:08.910]  You need to go to the doctor. You need to get everything checked out.
[01:08.930 --> 01:10.690]  Because you're all wrong.
[01:11.350 --> 01:12.550]  Uh, no, I want to talk about...
[01:12.550 --> 01:15.090]  I'll go to the doctor and say, Doctor, I can hear too well.
[01:15.410 --> 01:19.290]  Yeah, I did. Check out if I have super sensitive hearing.
[01:20.310 --> 01:21.750]  Uh, a lot of that going around these days.
[01:23.310 --> 01:24.170]  What was that?
[01:24.750 --> 01:26.450]  Uh, just saying hi to the people listening.
[01:29.130 --> 01:30.390]  What? Okay.
[01:30.530 --> 01:32.830]  Uh, I wanted to talk about the baseball bats.
[01:32.970 --> 01:34.730]  They came out right after we, yeah.
[01:34.730 --> 01:37.390]  And I wanted to talk about, that I forgot to talk about,
[01:37.510 --> 01:39.290]  the Billy Ripken thing
[01:39.290 --> 01:41.110]  that I discussed with you guys in text.
[01:41.550 --> 01:43.290]  And then, uh, how Eric
[01:43.750 --> 01:44.970]  completely and totally
[01:46.590 --> 01:47.470]  misinterpreted my
[01:47.470 --> 01:48.970]  uh, my recommendation.
[01:49.490 --> 01:50.110]  I already know.
[01:50.890 --> 01:52.450]  And how, uh, and how
[01:53.930 --> 01:55.350]  Andrew, uh, thinks
[01:55.350 --> 01:57.410]  that he and I are, Andrew thinks
[01:57.410 --> 01:58.950]  that we are ridiculous on the same scale
[01:58.950 --> 02:00.210]  and I think that that's ludicrous.
[02:00.690 --> 02:02.230]  What do you want to start with? What episode is this?
[02:02.230 --> 02:03.030]  That's, that's a lot.
[02:04.030 --> 02:05.970]  That's a good question. What episode is this? 38?
[02:06.090 --> 02:06.730]  Is that a guess?
[02:07.970 --> 02:09.430]  Welcome to episode 38.
[02:09.810 --> 02:11.930]  That can't be right. 35 feels low.
[02:11.990 --> 02:13.350]  I feel like last week was 35.
[02:13.730 --> 02:15.310]  You think we've done a few 35s already?
[02:15.930 --> 02:17.050]  I think it's possible.
[02:17.730 --> 02:20.470]  I don't understand what you mean when you say that can't be right.
[02:21.190 --> 02:21.790]  What does that mean?
[02:21.790 --> 02:23.250]  No, you know what? You're right.
[02:23.310 --> 02:24.590]  That was my fault, Eric.
[02:24.750 --> 02:27.670]  I accidentally called last week's episode 35
[02:27.670 --> 02:29.470]  when I saved it. That's why I thought that.
[02:29.470 --> 02:30.990]  You're right. This is 35. You're right.
[02:31.330 --> 02:32.550]  That's my mistake. Thanks.
[02:33.110 --> 02:33.710]  You're right.
[02:34.290 --> 02:37.330]  You know, I have a wallpaper in my office
[02:37.330 --> 02:39.090]  and I was just looking at it
[02:39.090 --> 02:41.490]  and I just noticed that if you look at it
[02:41.490 --> 02:42.530]  from a certain angle
[02:43.010 --> 02:44.330]  it looks like a
[02:45.010 --> 02:46.550]  one of the, it's like a flower
[02:46.550 --> 02:48.010]  it looks like a bull
[02:48.010 --> 02:50.570]  is getting anally penetrated
[02:50.570 --> 02:53.470]  by a dildo with spikes.
[02:54.430 --> 02:55.110]  I'm going to need a picture.
[02:55.290 --> 02:57.910]  I don't think that's going to come across too well.
[02:57.910 --> 02:59.590]  I'm going to send it to you right now.
[03:00.030 --> 03:02.170]  Do you remember his last topic?
[03:02.470 --> 03:03.810]  No, I think I'm good.
[03:03.870 --> 03:04.870]  I don't think I need that one.
[03:05.090 --> 03:07.730]  His last topic was that
[03:07.730 --> 03:09.970]  he is less ridiculous than I am.
[03:10.190 --> 03:12.190]  So how did that start?
[03:12.610 --> 03:14.270]  The slack was kicking off today.
[03:14.330 --> 03:15.770]  I didn't get involved. I didn't want to waste
[03:17.270 --> 03:18.210]  content for this.
[03:18.390 --> 03:19.250]  What went down?
[03:19.910 --> 03:22.250]  Hold on, I need to sit still to take the photo better.
[03:22.790 --> 03:24.610]  Let me text this photo to you.
[03:25.470 --> 03:26.510]  Here's what happened.
[03:26.510 --> 03:27.410]  Here's what happened.
[03:30.230 --> 03:31.270]  Before you do this,
[03:31.350 --> 03:32.210]  maybe we should ask Gavin
[03:32.210 --> 03:33.230]  because he didn't look at it.
[03:33.270 --> 03:34.370]  We could just get Gavin's opinion.
[03:35.730 --> 03:38.530]  Gavin, you know how Geoff has been doing
[03:38.530 --> 03:39.450]  the blow dryer thing?
[03:42.850 --> 03:44.570]  Is there any other process
[03:44.570 --> 03:46.130]  outside of using the blow dryer
[03:46.130 --> 03:47.050]  based on what Geoff said?
[03:47.630 --> 03:48.150]  What do you mean?
[03:48.490 --> 03:49.750]  So you get out of the shower
[03:50.630 --> 03:52.090]  Geoff gets out of the shower
[03:52.090 --> 03:53.070]  and then what does he do?
[03:54.590 --> 03:55.350]  Well, I see
[03:56.370 --> 03:57.690]  towel off and then give himself
[03:57.690 --> 03:58.190]  a blast.
[03:58.330 --> 03:59.050]  Thank you.
[03:59.310 --> 04:03.050]  Thank you.
[04:03.190 --> 04:04.930]  Geoff has never brought up a towel.
[04:05.150 --> 04:06.230]  Yes he has.
[04:06.810 --> 04:09.010]  I even talked about how the towel was a good thing
[04:09.010 --> 04:10.290]  because it acts as an astringent
[04:10.290 --> 04:12.030]  and it sloths off the dead skin.
[04:13.270 --> 04:14.710]  Eric was bitching
[04:14.710 --> 04:16.670]  that he dried himself off with the dryer
[04:16.670 --> 04:18.630]  and it's bullshit because his arm is sore
[04:18.630 --> 04:20.010]  because it took too long
[04:20.010 --> 04:22.470]  because he didn't dry his body off with a towel first.
[04:23.110 --> 04:24.150]  Okay, but Eric
[04:24.150 --> 04:25.990]  does that mean that you get out of the shower
[04:25.990 --> 04:27.110]  hair soaking wet
[04:28.290 --> 04:29.950]  go straight to the hair dryer
[04:29.950 --> 04:31.110]  and get your hair dry like that?
[04:32.610 --> 04:34.570]  He didn't say anything about a towel
[04:34.570 --> 04:36.330]  I wanted to see what he was talking about
[04:36.330 --> 04:37.970]  I'm talking about just in general
[04:37.970 --> 04:39.350]  with your use of hair dryers
[04:40.570 --> 04:42.030]  Here's the thing
[04:42.430 --> 04:44.090]  I don't want you to think that this is something
[04:44.090 --> 04:45.050]  that I do all the time
[04:45.050 --> 04:47.670]  I'm trying to put into practical use
[04:47.670 --> 04:49.450]  what has been talked about on this podcast
[04:49.450 --> 04:52.230]  So, I took a shower one time
[04:52.230 --> 04:53.770]  and didn't dry my ass
[04:53.770 --> 04:55.330]  and then put on clothes
[04:55.330 --> 04:56.830]  because Andrew talked about that
[04:56.830 --> 04:57.810]  That was terrible
[04:57.810 --> 05:01.930]  That felt awful
[05:01.930 --> 05:02.990]  I don't know why
[05:02.990 --> 05:06.030]  I don't know how you would forget
[05:06.030 --> 05:07.510]  to dry your own ass
[05:07.510 --> 05:09.190]  but it was awful
[05:09.190 --> 05:10.990]  It's a terrible experience
[05:12.040 --> 05:12.990]  Here's what I said
[05:12.990 --> 05:14.370]  I said when you get out of the shower
[05:14.370 --> 05:15.890]  and you towel yourself off
[05:15.890 --> 05:17.810]  you notice parts of you are still wet
[05:17.810 --> 05:20.410]  your butthole area might be a little damp
[05:20.410 --> 05:21.570]  under your balls is moist
[05:21.570 --> 05:23.470]  sometimes you miss some stuff on your back
[05:23.470 --> 05:25.430]  and so when I'm drying my hair
[05:25.430 --> 05:27.470]  I hit those moist spots with the dryer
[05:27.470 --> 05:29.270]  and I fell in love with it
[05:29.270 --> 05:30.170]  and I've got a whole new routine
[05:30.170 --> 05:31.850]  I think I was very clear
[05:31.850 --> 05:34.170]  and I think if we go back and look at the tape
[05:34.170 --> 05:36.510]  we can find multiple instances where I mention a towel
[05:37.870 --> 05:39.110]  I'm not going to do that
[05:40.730 --> 05:42.290]  Gavin understood it to be that
[05:42.910 --> 05:47.970]  I've never got dripping wet and picked up a hair dryer for a start. Usually a hair dryer is just...
[05:47.970 --> 05:48.350]  Well, neither had I!
[05:49.570 --> 05:50.590]  So why were you doing it?
[05:50.650 --> 05:52.610]  Because, because, that's why I couldn't...
[05:52.610 --> 05:53.250]  Because you could have blown it across the bathroom.
[05:53.390 --> 05:56.850]  I just told you that I'm trying to put into practical use the things that were talked
[05:56.850 --> 06:01.210]  about on this show. So I thought I was doing what Geoff was talking about, drying himself
[06:01.210 --> 06:06.230]  with a hair dryer, because I remember him saying the towel was astringent, and I thought that
[06:06.230 --> 06:07.890]  was a bad thing, maybe?
[06:08.150 --> 06:11.570]  No, I said it was good because it's, it's, it's... we were talking about something else
[06:11.570 --> 06:15.010]  and I was just saying a towel can act as an astringent, it's good because it rubs off
[06:15.010 --> 06:15.590]  dead skin.
[06:15.970 --> 06:18.910]  And you, and you both thought this, uh, Andrew as well?
[06:19.370 --> 06:24.390]  Yeah, I had, I thought that Geoff was selling a towel-less world, which I could get behind,
[06:24.510 --> 06:26.930]  and I was excited about this idea, but...
[06:26.930 --> 06:30.270]  I mean, you could probably shake off if you want to avoid the towel, but I wouldn't be, like,
[06:31.290 --> 06:35.110]  soaked through, throwing water all over my bathroom, propelled by air. That sounds a
[06:35.110 --> 06:35.670]  bit mental to me.
[06:35.690 --> 06:38.150]  I dried my entire body with the hair dryer.
[06:38.610 --> 06:39.730]  It must have taken you a year.
[06:39.730 --> 06:45.350]  It took so, my arm was so exhausted, I just went, why does he, I kept thinking, why does
[06:45.350 --> 06:48.790]  he do this every time he takes a shower?
[06:49.230 --> 06:52.890]  Here's what I, here's what I know. I know you're a reasonably good guy, Eric, and I
[06:52.890 --> 06:57.310]  know you're not as dumb as you're sounding right now. So what I'm gonna assume is you
[06:57.310 --> 07:02.330]  probably had to leave for a quote-unquote meeting when we were talking about it fully,
[07:02.410 --> 07:03.570]  and you missed the part where I-
[07:03.570 --> 07:07.190]  No, I just remember you saying the towel's astringent, and I thought that was a bad thing,
[07:07.390 --> 07:07.750]  so I went-
[07:07.750 --> 07:12.270]  That wasn't even, that wasn't even the part when, that towel astringent thing, that was
[07:12.270 --> 07:18.090]  recently. I have been promoting this as a time-saving, life-improving tool for a long
[07:18.090 --> 07:18.370]  time.
[07:18.590 --> 07:20.530]  How is it time-saving though, at that point?
[07:20.690 --> 07:23.470]  No, it's apparently, it's not, I don't think it was a time-saving thing.
[07:23.610 --> 07:25.450]  I don't think there's any time-saving-
[07:25.450 --> 07:29.690]  It's saving time compared to what Eric's doing. And here's how it's saving time, Andrew.
[07:30.270 --> 07:33.090]  If you're drier and warmer and comfier, I bet you move faster.
[07:34.070 --> 07:35.610]  I would certainly get dressed quicker.
[07:35.610 --> 07:38.330]  Yeah, you get dressed quicker, you do.
[07:38.690 --> 07:40.890]  A towel could only give you so much dryness.
[07:41.650 --> 07:42.710]  What does that mean?
[07:43.170 --> 07:46.010]  You can't get completely dry with a towel.
[07:46.490 --> 07:46.790]  You absolutely can.
[07:46.790 --> 07:50.910]  At some point, the harder you work with a towel, you're getting diminishing returns.
[07:50.910 --> 07:56.770]  It's diminishing returns, yeah. Your hair especially, like the scalp area, you can't
[07:56.770 --> 07:58.930]  really shove a towel down all of those hairs.
[07:59.250 --> 08:00.350]  This is insane to me.
[08:00.610 --> 08:01.270]  What do you mean?
[08:01.710 --> 08:05.050]  Then why use a blow dryer for anything?
[08:05.570 --> 08:06.230]  Well, I guess the hair...
[08:06.230 --> 08:08.030]  No, it's you know, I just don't use the blow dryer.
[08:08.130 --> 08:08.970]  It's not part of my routine.
[08:09.250 --> 08:10.210]  So it's just odd to me.
[08:10.550 --> 08:11.690]  I think the towel is fantastic.
[08:12.170 --> 08:15.650]  I didn't use a blow dryer for probably 35 years.
[08:15.830 --> 08:18.810]  And then someone convinced me to, or I read about it or something.
[08:18.870 --> 08:20.510]  And I tried one and I'll never go back.
[08:20.770 --> 08:21.470]  Changed my life.
[08:21.750 --> 08:22.230]  In what way?
[08:22.850 --> 08:24.250]  Well, it makes your hair...
[08:24.250 --> 08:27.010]  It made my hair a lot less plaster to my head, first of all.
[08:27.170 --> 08:28.470]  It got me out of the house.
[08:28.470 --> 08:31.770]  It got me out of the house faster on cold days because I didn't have to wait for my
[08:31.770 --> 08:32.890]  hair to completely dry.
[08:33.410 --> 08:37.010]  It made it faster for me when I had to like put shit in my hair and style it and stuff.
[08:37.050 --> 08:39.110]  I didn't have to wait an extra 15 minutes for my hair to dry.
[08:39.610 --> 08:41.710]  Like, and it made me warm and happy.
[08:41.790 --> 08:47.570]  And it led to me discovering that a blow dryer on your balls and in your butt crack and behind
[08:47.570 --> 08:50.510]  your knees and under your arms is fucking awesome.
[08:50.710 --> 08:51.370]  Behind the knees?
[08:51.630 --> 08:52.670]  It's not even any hair though.
[08:52.730 --> 08:53.610]  I don't see the point of that one.
[08:53.930 --> 08:54.690]  There's water there.
[08:55.210 --> 08:59.230]  Eric, you said earlier in the week, you said that you deliberately didn't dry your ass.
[08:59.290 --> 08:59.870]  Yeah, I want it.
[08:59.930 --> 09:01.390]  I'm trying to explain that.
[09:01.490 --> 09:05.830]  I'm trying to put what what is happening into this show, into practical use to see what
[09:05.830 --> 09:07.310]  it's like and...
[09:07.310 --> 09:10.150]  What practical use is there with Andrew forgetting to dry his asshole?
[09:10.370 --> 09:13.690]  I had to see what it was like because I don't think I've ever like...
[09:13.690 --> 09:20.010]  It just seems like so insane to dry your entire body and then not dry your ass.
[09:20.070 --> 09:21.210]  You forget about your ass.
[09:21.210 --> 09:23.310]  Just to be like, well, I got my legs.
[09:24.190 --> 09:25.190]  Skip on up.
[09:25.230 --> 09:26.030]  Got my torso.
[09:26.950 --> 09:29.290]  Yeah, you have to actively jump the gap.
[09:29.630 --> 09:30.750]  No, definitely.
[09:31.110 --> 09:34.710]  I'm clearing that gap frequently and I'm not aware of it.
[09:34.770 --> 09:38.010]  And then it's it's a real sadness that I'm glad Eric can now relate to.
[09:38.070 --> 09:40.870]  And you put your underwear on and it's just damp.
[09:40.990 --> 09:42.430]  It's just a bad start.
[09:42.850 --> 09:47.610]  It felt like, you know, when you're about to jump in a pool and you know the pool is
[09:47.610 --> 09:49.430]  cold, but you're just going to let go for it.
[09:49.430 --> 09:53.610]  That's how it felt putting on my underwear, knowing my ass was still wet.
[09:53.670 --> 09:56.790]  It was just like, oh, we're about to get into something that's not going to be good.
[09:56.950 --> 09:58.570]  Yeah, that's a whole other layer.
[09:58.650 --> 09:59.510]  I never see it coming.
[09:59.890 --> 10:00.750]  I can't relate to that.
[10:00.770 --> 10:02.650]  That's gotta set you up for a bad day.
[10:02.930 --> 10:03.670]  It is demoralizing.
[10:03.670 --> 10:05.190]  It's a lot to recover from.
[10:05.670 --> 10:09.290]  It is rare to feel like you've lost when all you've done is enter the bathroom,
[10:09.390 --> 10:11.710]  but you feel like you've lost on the day and you have ground again.
[10:11.770 --> 10:12.670]  It's not game over.
[10:12.870 --> 10:15.090]  Just take them off, dry them and put on new ones.
[10:15.230 --> 10:17.070]  It, Gavin, you got to try it.
[10:17.130 --> 10:18.590]  It's a real demoralizer.
[10:18.590 --> 10:23.070]  If anything, it's sort of a motivator because you feel like you need to win the day back,
[10:23.130 --> 10:27.190]  like you're starting at a deficit, like you fumbled the ball on the first drive
[10:27.190 --> 10:29.110]  and you now need to get those points back.
[10:29.190 --> 10:30.710]  So in a way, it may be a good thing.
[10:31.130 --> 10:31.570]  I love it.
[10:31.950 --> 10:32.970]  Oh, I got another thing, too.
[10:33.190 --> 10:34.110]  I hate to say it.
[10:34.370 --> 10:36.030]  I got more foot related problems.
[10:36.410 --> 10:36.830]  Oh, God.
[10:37.290 --> 10:43.210]  You might remember recently I had an issue which continues to persist,
[10:43.530 --> 10:45.310]  including the socks I'm wearing right now.
[10:45.310 --> 10:52.830]  My yellow van socks that I had today fucked me in the butt and switched on me as my socks do every day.
[10:53.030 --> 10:54.610]  Well, it's been brought to my attention.
[10:54.830 --> 10:57.390]  My girlfriend pointed it out because I'm always bitching about it.
[10:57.770 --> 11:01.110]  I can't leave the house without stepping in dog shit.
[11:03.550 --> 11:05.590]  My backyard, I got two old dogs.
[11:05.670 --> 11:07.270]  They shit a decent dog amount.
[11:08.050 --> 11:09.290]  I clean it up constantly.
[11:09.650 --> 11:14.570]  I try to stay on top of it because I spend so much time spraying dog shit off my shoes.
[11:15.010 --> 11:17.630]  They're not inordinately large shitters.
[11:17.810 --> 11:18.850]  You know, they're normal dogs.
[11:19.010 --> 11:22.050]  They have, I think they're actually on low residue diets.
[11:22.510 --> 11:25.290]  So I don't understand.
[11:26.490 --> 11:29.330]  I had an idea, you know, because I have been trying.
[11:30.030 --> 11:34.690]  I've been trying for, well, Emily moved in in March, right?
[11:34.730 --> 11:36.150]  And we'd been dating for a couple years before that.
[11:36.230 --> 11:39.270]  I've been trying to catch her in the act of shitting, right?
[11:40.190 --> 11:41.610]  Because she persists.
[11:43.950 --> 11:46.970]  Much like Kim Jong, her body produces no fecal matter.
[11:49.770 --> 11:51.890]  And nor does it fart.
[11:52.070 --> 11:53.530]  It just burps constantly.
[11:54.210 --> 11:56.430]  And she apparently expels all of those things through her mouth.
[11:57.570 --> 11:58.510]  But I don't buy it.
[11:58.630 --> 11:59.350]  And then it struck me.
[11:59.410 --> 12:01.030]  I've been stepping in shit so much.
[12:01.150 --> 12:02.530]  And it's more than two dogs can shit.
[12:02.610 --> 12:03.530]  And I sweep the yard constantly.
[12:03.790 --> 12:05.270]  I think Emily's shitting in the backyard.
[12:05.270 --> 12:09.490]  Or maybe she's shitting into a bag in the toilet and then throwing it in the backyard.
[12:09.670 --> 12:10.790]  But it fucking hit me.
[12:10.990 --> 12:11.330]  Two things.
[12:11.470 --> 12:19.010]  A, not only am I cleaning up my girlfriend's shit in doggy bags, but I'm also stepping in it.
[12:19.130 --> 12:20.830]  Why are you in your backyard so much?
[12:21.910 --> 12:23.150]  Well, I got to get to my bicycle.
[12:24.030 --> 12:25.670]  And I got to pick up the dog shit.
[12:28.710 --> 12:30.450]  I got so many windows in my house.
[12:30.550 --> 12:31.050]  I can't look out.
[12:31.090 --> 12:33.930]  If I look out my back window, I will see a pile of dog shit.
[12:33.990 --> 12:34.930]  And I have to run out.
[12:34.930 --> 12:36.030]  It's like an obsession with me.
[12:36.250 --> 12:38.130]  I have to run out and immediately pick it up.
[12:38.150 --> 12:42.470]  Because I don't like the idea of feces just languishing about, relaxing.
[12:43.690 --> 12:45.310]  Like it's sunning in my backyard.
[12:45.550 --> 12:47.450]  I mean, that's where most of the feces is, though.
[12:47.510 --> 12:48.290]  It's just sunning.
[12:49.930 --> 12:50.690]  I mean, not humans.
[12:50.910 --> 12:51.410]  Most humans don't.
[12:51.410 --> 12:55.690]  Gavin, most of it is smooshed into the waffle print of the bottom of my veins.
[12:56.570 --> 12:57.970]  That's where most of it is.
[12:58.230 --> 13:02.370]  I have to bring up the earnestness in which you wrapped up your whole thing about your
[13:02.370 --> 13:04.470]  girlfriend not shitting with, I don't buy it.
[13:04.470 --> 13:05.590]  That was incredible.
[13:05.830 --> 13:08.850]  You said that with such an honesty, like it's implausible.
[13:09.510 --> 13:11.010]  Like it could be a convincing lie.
[13:11.550 --> 13:12.610]  I've been mad about it for years.
[13:12.790 --> 13:13.770]  For a long time, dude.
[13:15.210 --> 13:16.170]  It's impossible.
[13:16.530 --> 13:19.670]  She moved in two weeks before the goddamn pandemic.
[13:20.050 --> 13:22.370]  And then we didn't leave the house for nine months.
[13:23.030 --> 13:23.250]  Wow.
[13:23.430 --> 13:27.870]  You mean to tell me that that woman, that five foot six little blonde lady,
[13:28.270 --> 13:30.750]  has not shit in ten months?
[13:31.290 --> 13:32.150]  At this point?
[13:32.750 --> 13:33.970]  It's bullshit.
[13:34.750 --> 13:38.070]  We're down to one bathroom, guys, because my fucking toilet.
[13:38.390 --> 13:40.630]  Because the plumbing under my house disintegrated, right?
[13:41.030 --> 13:43.330]  So it's two people, one bathroom.
[13:43.550 --> 13:44.730]  The bathroom's in our bedroom.
[13:44.950 --> 13:46.030]  I'm in our bedroom a lot.
[13:46.130 --> 13:46.650]  I sleep there.
[13:46.810 --> 13:48.110]  I'm gonna see it if she goes in there.
[13:48.230 --> 13:49.730]  I hide in her closet sometimes.
[13:49.950 --> 13:52.590]  I'm telling you, if she shits, she does it in the yard.
[13:53.090 --> 13:53.670]  I don't think she does.
[13:53.870 --> 13:53.890]  I don't know how.
[13:54.490 --> 13:56.590]  I think it's more likely, she's classier than that.
[13:56.670 --> 14:00.270]  It's more likely that while some of the yard work was going on, or while some of the, you know,
[14:00.270 --> 14:01.530]  the library work was going on,
[14:01.870 --> 14:06.270]  she had a secret bathroom commissioned that you don't know where it is.
[14:06.350 --> 14:07.530]  I think that's much more likely.
[14:07.870 --> 14:12.090]  I used to think, I used, and I was gonna follow her, but it starts to get stalkerish.
[14:12.230 --> 14:13.290]  I don't wanna do that, you know?
[14:13.350 --> 14:15.610]  I don't wanna, I don't wanna be a creepy dude.
[14:16.030 --> 14:19.430]  But like, I used to think that maybe on her way to or from work,
[14:19.510 --> 14:22.010]  she had like a Starbucks, or like an Office Depot,
[14:22.430 --> 14:26.810]  or like a Best Buy she stopped at that's like her, her toilet away from home,
[14:27.090 --> 14:28.650]  where she does all of her secret shitting.
[14:28.650 --> 14:31.650]  Because she insists that you can't shit at her salon,
[14:32.350 --> 14:34.310]  because there's people there getting their hair done,
[14:34.430 --> 14:36.690]  and it would stink, so nobody poops at her salon either.
[14:36.930 --> 14:39.510]  So that, so if she doesn't shit at home, and she doesn't shit at work,
[14:39.690 --> 14:41.110]  she's got to be shitting en route.
[14:41.850 --> 14:44.910]  So it's like the mentality of like, if you're in a hotel room with someone,
[14:45.150 --> 14:46.510]  you don't know each other super well,
[14:46.910 --> 14:48.670]  you'll go down to the lobby to take the shit.
[14:48.710 --> 14:50.270]  Yeah, yeah, shit in the lobby, 100%, 100%.
[14:50.270 --> 14:53.270]  But then the pandemic happened, and she stopped working for a long time.
[14:53.450 --> 14:58.250]  So it wasn't like she could like, pop on off to Best Buy to drop her load,
[14:58.250 --> 14:58.870]  right?
[15:00.690 --> 15:02.190]  Anyway, I got off on a tangent.
[15:02.430 --> 15:05.610]  I just wanted to say, I'm so fucking sick of foot-related issues,
[15:05.710 --> 15:08.050]  and I'm so fucking sick of cleaning dog shit off my feet.
[15:08.230 --> 15:11.130]  I've had to wash this pair of Vans that I'm wearing now three,
[15:11.250 --> 15:13.350]  what's today, Thursday? Three times this week.
[15:13.750 --> 15:16.490]  If I gave you a hundred thousand dollars,
[15:16.830 --> 15:21.110]  or let's say that I was going to cover the entire cost of ripping up all your pipes,
[15:21.650 --> 15:24.790]  job done, but you have to shit in a Best Buy for a year, would you do it?
[15:25.030 --> 15:25.310]  Yes.
[15:25.790 --> 15:27.390]  You just, you can only shit at Best Buy.
[15:27.390 --> 15:29.730]  Middle of the night, you gotta hold it in till the next morning.
[15:30.610 --> 15:30.930]  Oh.
[15:31.470 --> 15:32.630]  That's such an easy bet.
[15:33.310 --> 15:34.730]  What if it's like a diarrhea situation?
[15:35.550 --> 15:36.030]  Wait, can-
[15:36.030 --> 15:37.430]  Oh, then I hope you're in a Best Buy.
[15:38.230 --> 15:41.570]  Like if it just evacuates, like if I shit in my pants last week.
[15:42.270 --> 15:43.090]  Could it be any Best Buy?
[15:43.250 --> 15:45.370]  Any Best Buy, yeah. Not a specific Best Buy.
[15:45.670 --> 15:49.050]  And I can only shit there, like this isn't a thing of like,
[15:49.090 --> 15:52.850]  what if I shit myself outside? Like it's an uncomfortable shit.
[15:53.010 --> 15:54.890]  I lose the bet. It has to be in a Best Buy.
[15:54.890 --> 15:58.770]  All of your turd has to land from anus to water in a Best Buy.
[15:59.110 --> 16:04.370]  Okay. What if I, what if I shit in a bucket and then bring it into a Best Buy?
[16:04.470 --> 16:05.530]  No, no, no, no.
[16:06.370 --> 16:07.430]  I think I could make this work.
[16:07.470 --> 16:08.470]  I don't think you could do that though.
[16:08.490 --> 16:10.930]  I don't think you're allowed to walk into Best Buy with buckets of feces.
[16:11.030 --> 16:12.110]  Well, I feel like for this bet-
[16:12.110 --> 16:13.210]  If they don't catch you.
[16:13.610 --> 16:14.750]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[16:15.130 --> 16:18.290]  For the bet rules, if you're allowing me to do that, I feel like you'd let me.
[16:18.510 --> 16:21.630]  Here's what you do, Andrew. Here's what you do. I have the perfect cover for you.
[16:21.770 --> 16:24.510]  What you need to do is you get like a Dickies jumpsuit.
[16:24.930 --> 16:25.590]  Right? Okay.
[16:25.770 --> 16:27.830]  Just put a name on the front of it.
[16:28.190 --> 16:29.130]  Like an embroidered name.
[16:29.210 --> 16:29.830]  Doesn't have to be your name.
[16:29.910 --> 16:31.510]  Just could be Craig or Bill or whatever.
[16:31.870 --> 16:37.270]  Right? Then just get a clipboard with some paper on it.
[16:37.310 --> 16:38.070]  Doesn't have to be anything.
[16:38.510 --> 16:39.350]  Just a clipboard.
[16:39.850 --> 16:41.710]  And then in your other hand, get a tool chest.
[16:41.850 --> 16:44.850]  Put the shit in a box, like in a bag in the tool chest.
[16:45.010 --> 16:48.430]  And then walk in like you're on, like you're there to fix something.
[16:48.730 --> 16:48.990]  Okay.
[16:49.090 --> 16:50.750]  Nobody questions the repairman.
[16:51.130 --> 16:52.630]  Yeah, that's a great plan.
[16:53.150 --> 16:53.330]  Yeah.
[16:53.330 --> 16:56.210]  I'm a personal home game shitter.
[16:56.330 --> 16:57.890]  I don't shit on the road that much.
[16:57.930 --> 16:58.950]  I don't like public restrooms.
[16:59.190 --> 17:02.390]  But if I have to shit in essentially one Best Buy,
[17:02.470 --> 17:04.530]  I think that would become my home game pretty quickly.
[17:04.910 --> 17:06.590]  That'd be like my home stadium, that toilet.
[17:06.710 --> 17:07.950]  I'd get to know it really comfortably.
[17:08.430 --> 17:10.850]  So I think if I can make it through like the first week, I'd be good.
[17:10.870 --> 17:15.370]  Do you think if you picked, if you chose to go this route, what is it, a year?
[17:15.790 --> 17:18.510]  Do you think after like maybe a month of shitting in the Best Buy,
[17:18.590 --> 17:21.030]  you would bring stuff from home to start to make it feel more,
[17:21.150 --> 17:22.950]  like to start to modify it to make it feel a little bit more...
[17:22.950 --> 17:24.150]  Like a candle in a magazine?
[17:24.710 --> 17:27.670]  Yeah, or like, you know, a doily or you spruce it up a bit.
[17:28.130 --> 17:29.830]  I would bring my own toilet paper.
[17:30.070 --> 17:32.090]  A hundred percent. Can't use their bullshit.
[17:32.350 --> 17:33.550]  You got to bring your own toilet paper.
[17:34.210 --> 17:35.130]  I don't know. I don't.
[17:35.190 --> 17:37.570]  I don't think I've ever been in a Best Buy toilet.
[17:37.690 --> 17:38.350]  Do they even have them?
[17:40.130 --> 17:40.890]  I assume they do.
[17:41.170 --> 17:43.190]  Yeah, I shit. I shit. I don't shit.
[17:43.570 --> 17:47.830]  I'm similar to Andrew. I prefer to shit at home and not in the yard.
[17:48.310 --> 17:48.690]  Home advantage.
[17:49.410 --> 17:53.290]  But I pee in a lot of container stores now.
[17:54.290 --> 17:55.770]  People have pants in a lot of container stores.
[17:55.870 --> 17:58.810]  A lot of Home Depots and Lowe's and they also have decent bathrooms.
[17:59.470 --> 18:02.410]  Speaking of bathrooms, I've had a... I don't know if I was telling you about how
[18:02.410 --> 18:04.130]  I had a blocked sink.
[18:04.250 --> 18:04.350]  Yeah.
[18:04.610 --> 18:09.330]  The guest sink. It's usually where Dan sleeps when he's there, but hasn't been in about a year.
[18:09.490 --> 18:11.150]  So it's been just a bit empty.
[18:11.390 --> 18:13.830]  The other day I was just washing my hands in it or something.
[18:14.530 --> 18:18.210]  And the water just... it was draining slowly before.
[18:18.210 --> 18:20.390]  The water just stopped dead in the sink.
[18:20.490 --> 18:22.710]  I was like, oh no, what's going on here?
[18:22.730 --> 18:27.690]  So I put some... I did some Drano, which I've heard can sometimes be bad for your pipes.
[18:27.750 --> 18:28.450]  That didn't do anything.
[18:28.610 --> 18:30.350]  It just... the Drano got stuck.
[18:31.030 --> 18:35.650]  And then I did baking soda and vinegar, which I also thought was going to work.
[18:35.710 --> 18:36.250]  Didn't do anything.
[18:36.510 --> 18:41.470]  In the end, I bought off Amazon a little... it's like a plastic orange thing with a bunch
[18:41.470 --> 18:43.130]  of barbs on it and you shove it down.
[18:43.350 --> 18:44.650]  It's meant to pull hair out.
[18:45.330 --> 18:46.050]  Did that.
[18:46.190 --> 18:47.250]  Shoved it all the way down.
[18:48.330 --> 18:49.370]  Struggled with it a little bit.
[18:49.470 --> 18:50.070]  Pulled it up.
[18:50.250 --> 18:54.350]  A gigantic drain hole sized mushroom.
[18:54.770 --> 18:55.090]  What?
[18:55.590 --> 18:57.630]  It was... I got sink shrooms.
[18:58.330 --> 19:02.330]  It was just a massive mushroom that had the cap was completely...
[19:02.970 --> 19:07.530]  I think I got some like major mold problems in the guest bathroom.
[19:08.090 --> 19:09.050]  I don't know what to do about it.
[19:09.550 --> 19:13.330]  Yeah, that sounds... that sounds bad.
[19:13.330 --> 19:14.090]  Yeah.
[19:14.430 --> 19:20.610]  That sounds... there shouldn't be enough standing anything for it to grow in there.
[19:21.210 --> 19:22.910]  You... you know what it sounds like?
[19:22.970 --> 19:24.290]  It sounds like what the problem I'm having.
[19:26.990 --> 19:33.570]  You... you should probably... you should probably call a plumber and ask them.
[19:34.410 --> 19:38.710]  Tell them what you just told us in the exact same way you told us and say,
[19:38.810 --> 19:40.330]  is it an issue in my house?
[19:40.350 --> 19:41.790]  Which I think is a fairly new house.
[19:41.870 --> 19:43.090]  My house is like 100 years old.
[19:44.050 --> 19:49.150]  Is it an issue that my bat... my guest sink is growing giant mushrooms?
[19:49.450 --> 19:52.210]  And I'm going to... I'm going to guess they're going to come down immediately.
[19:52.630 --> 19:54.990]  And you're going to... you and I are going to be...
[19:54.990 --> 19:58.570]  you and I are going to be partners in misery for a couple...
[19:58.570 --> 20:00.170]  I immediately turned around.
[20:00.410 --> 20:02.570]  I went and got a mask and some rubber gloves.
[20:02.670 --> 20:06.350]  And I just had to smash that thing to pieces until it all went down.
[20:06.390 --> 20:07.510]  And I poured bleach down.
[20:07.530 --> 20:09.430]  I was... I was trying to murder this fungus.
[20:09.950 --> 20:11.490]  I just don't know how far it goes down.
[20:11.490 --> 20:13.250]  Because I assume there was just some...
[20:14.690 --> 20:16.310]  I assume there was just some water.
[20:16.410 --> 20:17.570]  It's like sat in the little...
[20:20.250 --> 20:21.670]  It was like...
[20:21.670 --> 20:23.790]  It was like slimy and black.
[20:24.050 --> 20:29.390]  If you had to guess... if you had to guess how many feet in it is, how would you...
[20:29.390 --> 20:29.870]  what would you guess?
[20:30.110 --> 20:32.530]  I think it was growing from the base of where it curves.
[20:34.290 --> 20:37.010]  So not in the wall yet, just under the sink.
[20:37.170 --> 20:39.090]  Oh, I don't know. I don't want to take off the...
[20:39.530 --> 20:41.130]  I don't want to... I don't want to open the pipe.
[20:41.130 --> 20:43.950]  I know what's in there and I don't want to see it.
[20:44.130 --> 20:45.330]  Because I was gagging.
[20:45.510 --> 20:48.330]  I was... as I was trying to flush it down, I was spitting.
[20:48.490 --> 20:50.510]  I was choking on the look of it.
[20:50.770 --> 20:52.370]  I almost threw up in the mask.
[20:52.830 --> 20:54.150]  It was splashing on me.
[20:54.470 --> 20:55.530]  It was a nightmare.
[20:55.710 --> 20:59.330]  All I did, I smashed it to pieces, flushed what I could of it down.
[20:59.430 --> 21:00.730]  I made sure the water drained again.
[21:00.870 --> 21:03.350]  Then I closed the bathroom door and I closed the room door.
[21:03.450 --> 21:04.270]  And I haven't been in there since.
[21:04.870 --> 21:07.690]  It's the fucking... that's the joys of homeownership, man.
[21:07.830 --> 21:09.230]  My kitchen sink stopped working.
[21:09.750 --> 21:12.130]  If you both have to dig up your entire yards,
[21:12.130 --> 21:14.950]  I'm going to be the happiest I may have ever been in my life.
[21:15.130 --> 21:15.830]  I'm so excited.
[21:16.110 --> 21:17.610]  I think I'm going to have to open the wall, Andrew.
[21:17.870 --> 21:18.870]  I think I'm going to have to...
[21:18.870 --> 21:20.530]  I don't want to live in a fungus house.
[21:20.730 --> 21:24.310]  I already... did I tell you about my carpet mushrooms that I had in my first house?
[21:24.930 --> 21:25.290]  No.
[21:27.130 --> 21:28.810]  You have a whole mushroom thing.
[21:29.090 --> 21:32.590]  If you would have pulled the mushroom out of the fucking sink while I was there,
[21:32.650 --> 21:34.490]  I would think you were doing a magic trick.
[21:34.810 --> 21:36.670]  I can't. I would never even consider it.
[21:36.970 --> 21:38.810]  I've never heard anything like this.
[21:38.810 --> 21:40.150]  For some reason, it happened.
[21:40.270 --> 21:43.370]  It happened, what, six years ago, seven years ago, maybe.
[21:43.750 --> 21:45.810]  I had my carpet mushrooms and now they've returned.
[21:45.910 --> 21:48.210]  Seven years later, the carpet mushrooms were...
[21:48.210 --> 21:52.390]  It was in my office, which was an old garage conversion.
[21:52.970 --> 21:55.170]  Used to be like a two-car garage, then became my office.
[21:55.690 --> 21:58.010]  But every so often, I would just get this cluster,
[21:58.210 --> 22:00.150]  maybe like the size of a cereal bowl,
[22:00.490 --> 22:03.330]  a cluster of mushrooms that would just grow up through the carpet.
[22:03.730 --> 22:07.190]  And I'd have to trim them and then I'd just take the vacuum over
[22:07.190 --> 22:09.110]  like I was mowing my carpet.
[22:09.410 --> 22:11.710]  And they'd come back every, like, few months.
[22:11.750 --> 22:13.470]  I'd have new mushrooms and I'd trim them again.
[22:13.650 --> 22:15.310]  And eventually, I moved.
[22:16.170 --> 22:19.730]  You never, like, asked anybody about the mushrooms?
[22:19.930 --> 22:20.810]  You didn't go for assistance?
[22:20.890 --> 22:22.290]  You just lived with...
[22:22.290 --> 22:23.570]  No, I just mowed the shrooms.
[22:24.250 --> 22:28.050]  And I was like, the house I got sucks and I should move out of it.
[22:29.230 --> 22:31.350]  Can I ask one more question about this?
[22:31.690 --> 22:31.870]  Yeah.
[22:31.870 --> 22:35.270]  Is this guest bathroom, uh, is it on the...
[22:35.270 --> 22:36.250]  Is it a...
[22:36.810 --> 22:38.030]  Well, you're British, right?
[22:38.030 --> 22:38.050]  It's upstairs.
[22:38.270 --> 22:39.050]  It's an upstairs.
[22:39.990 --> 22:42.870]  I can't imagine that improves the situation.
[22:43.110 --> 22:45.630]  I was really hoping you were gonna say it was a downstairs bathroom.
[22:46.110 --> 22:48.190]  What, for my sake or for comedy's sake?
[22:49.030 --> 22:50.410]  Well, for your sake.
[22:50.510 --> 22:54.450]  For comedy's sake, it being a second floor bathroom, I think is way funnier.
[22:54.810 --> 22:55.310]  I think that's...
[22:55.310 --> 22:55.450]  Oh, man.
[22:55.450 --> 22:57.730]  I think that is a...
[22:57.730 --> 22:58.690]  That's a bad sign.
[22:58.690 --> 23:05.430]  I assume Dan shaved in it once and then gauzed on it, brushing his teeth or something,
[23:05.710 --> 23:09.670]  and it just sat, and he left, and it just sat without a rinse.
[23:09.870 --> 23:10.750]  I think that's what happened.
[23:11.290 --> 23:13.230]  Well, he's probably covered in fungus anyway.
[23:14.170 --> 23:15.990]  Eric says, definitely Dan's fault.
[23:16.030 --> 23:16.710]  Yeah, I agree, Eric.
[23:17.070 --> 23:17.350]  Yeah.
[23:18.370 --> 23:20.530]  Dan's a human being I haven't thought of in a long time.
[23:20.830 --> 23:22.670]  I wonder how he weathered the pandemic.
[23:24.610 --> 23:25.790]  He's enjoying himself.
[23:26.270 --> 23:27.330]  Yeah, I bet he is.
[23:28.270 --> 23:30.570]  I had my own house issue as well.
[23:30.670 --> 23:31.950]  I can relate to this.
[23:32.050 --> 23:32.490]  Okay.
[23:32.570 --> 23:33.190]  I had my own problem.
[23:34.070 --> 23:36.710]  I have a Donkey Kong 64 update as well.
[23:37.310 --> 23:38.090]  Very sadly.
[23:38.510 --> 23:39.310]  Close your ears, Geoff.
[23:39.910 --> 23:40.830]  Oh, my God.
[23:42.970 --> 23:45.430]  You guys were doing this shit in text the other day, too.
[23:45.850 --> 23:49.770]  But by the way, the fucking Face Show, it just never stops now.
[23:50.010 --> 23:52.970]  It's a 24-hour-a-day fucking...
[23:52.970 --> 23:53.790]  It's gone too much.
[23:53.850 --> 23:56.730]  ...onslaught via Slack and text, and it just...
[23:56.730 --> 24:03.850]  I'm so mad about Donkey Kong 64 and how I'm not mad about it now because of you fuckers.
[24:05.010 --> 24:06.530]  I don't give a shit about it.
[24:06.530 --> 24:07.110]  I don't care.
[24:07.410 --> 24:08.390]  Talk about it.
[24:08.970 --> 24:10.530]  I have good news, Geoff, for you.
[24:11.150 --> 24:13.530]  This will be the last Donkey Kong 64 update.
[24:14.030 --> 24:16.250]  I'm never gonna beat Donkey Kong 64.
[24:17.110 --> 24:17.370]  Why not?
[24:17.890 --> 24:22.690]  I was getting ready for bed, and I have a fan that I turn on before I go to sleep,
[24:22.750 --> 24:24.730]  just as like a noise thing to drift off to.
[24:25.290 --> 24:26.070]  Yeah, a bit of white noise.
[24:26.450 --> 24:29.030]  A bit of white noise, and it wasn't on.
[24:29.270 --> 24:32.150]  Like, it was working, and it just wasn't start.
[24:32.510 --> 24:34.470]  So I thought, oh, sometimes the plug gets loose.
[24:34.890 --> 24:39.370]  So I shoved the plug in, and it like puttered, and nothing happened.
[24:39.410 --> 24:40.110]  I was like, that's weird.
[24:40.190 --> 24:44.070]  And I shoved it back in, puttered, nothing happened, shoved it in a third time.
[24:44.270 --> 24:51.810]  Then like a large spark flew out of the plug, and then I smelt smoke, and it didn't work.
[24:51.810 --> 24:56.630]  And I tripped the breaker in my room, and everything went out,
[24:56.710 --> 24:59.350]  and my Donkey Kong 64 didn't save properly.
[24:59.730 --> 25:00.850]  So I lost my save.
[25:01.810 --> 25:05.490]  Lost all progress trying to plug this fan in.
[25:05.810 --> 25:09.170]  I had too many devices plugged into my room, I believe, shockingly.
[25:09.450 --> 25:10.250]  I don't know if you believe that.
[25:10.910 --> 25:12.230]  Yeah, and I lost Donkey Kong 64.
[25:12.230 --> 25:13.990]  But it's because you got half a kitchen there.
[25:14.410 --> 25:16.650]  Yeah, that's, you know, it's a great point.
[25:16.990 --> 25:17.630]  I think you're right.
[25:17.690 --> 25:20.670]  I think the kitchen took down my Donkey Kong 64.
[25:21.830 --> 25:23.190]  But it's a fair trade.
[25:23.750 --> 25:24.990]  I'm loving the Keurig machine.
[25:25.090 --> 25:25.750]  I was here earlier.
[25:25.970 --> 25:29.110]  The reason why I had Craig in here is because somebody messaged me like,
[25:29.190 --> 25:31.010]  you should make ramen using the Keurig.
[25:31.090 --> 25:32.290]  Because I never really thought about it.
[25:32.290 --> 25:33.390]  It's just like a hot water machine.
[25:33.750 --> 25:34.750]  So I tried that.
[25:35.390 --> 25:36.110]  Pretty good.
[25:36.590 --> 25:39.690]  I thought it was going to shoot water everywhere, and I was going to burn myself.
[25:39.850 --> 25:40.950]  I was very nervous about it.
[25:41.010 --> 25:42.830]  That's why I wanted to have like a recording of it.
[25:43.090 --> 25:46.790]  It's like the saddest sputter of water I've ever seen.
[25:47.150 --> 25:47.930]  There's no risk.
[25:48.410 --> 25:49.930]  I don't know what the strength button does.
[25:50.010 --> 25:51.570]  Does anyone know what that, what does that mean?
[25:52.030 --> 25:53.890]  I think it just makes your coffee stronger.
[25:54.230 --> 25:54.990]  But what does that mean?
[25:55.370 --> 25:58.570]  I think it just puts more water through the pods before saying, hey, I'm done.
[25:59.890 --> 26:00.930]  Infuses longer, maybe.
[26:01.650 --> 26:01.950]  Okay.
[26:02.430 --> 26:05.030]  Well, I did medium strength, and yeah, I made a ramen before.
[26:05.170 --> 26:06.030]  Medium strength water?
[26:06.790 --> 26:07.970]  Yeah, medium strength water.
[26:08.290 --> 26:10.410]  What the fuck is that?
[26:11.950 --> 26:13.350]  Medium strength water.
[26:13.690 --> 26:14.330]  What do you mean?
[26:15.010 --> 26:16.370]  It only affects the pods.
[26:17.210 --> 26:19.910]  Unless you had a ramen pod in there, which I don't think you did.
[26:19.910 --> 26:22.290]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:22.290 --> 26:23.010]  I just had the bowl.
[26:23.150 --> 26:24.070]  Well, what does this?
[26:24.390 --> 26:27.390]  Well, the buttons, it doesn't manipulate the pot in any way.
[26:27.450 --> 26:28.910]  It'd be how the water flows, would it not?
[26:29.590 --> 26:29.890]  What?
[26:30.170 --> 26:30.330]  What?
[26:31.510 --> 26:33.110]  The pod is just the pod.
[26:33.150 --> 26:34.850]  The pod is a stationary object.
[26:35.070 --> 26:38.310]  I don't think any of the buttons impact the pod in any way.
[26:38.450 --> 26:42.450]  Yeah, but I'm saying the strength probably affects how long the water stays in the pod
[26:42.450 --> 26:44.130]  or how quickly it shoots through the pod.
[26:44.170 --> 26:47.350]  If it like goes slowly through the pod, I assume you get stronger coffee.
[26:47.350 --> 26:48.790]  Yeah, but I'm saying whatever...
[26:50.830 --> 26:53.170]  Medium water means nothing, is what he's saying.
[26:53.430 --> 26:57.410]  When you take the pod out, you can have hard, medium, or soft water.
[26:57.530 --> 26:59.170]  You're still gonna make the same fucking ramen.
[26:59.450 --> 27:00.530]  Which, by the way, just get a tea kettle.
[27:01.490 --> 27:04.310]  Well, I have a Keurig machine in my room, so why would I get a tea kettle?
[27:04.470 --> 27:05.010]  That's too much work.
[27:05.990 --> 27:07.750]  Yeah, well, it shoots hot water.
[27:07.890 --> 27:09.490]  It can be... it's whatever you want it to do.
[27:09.590 --> 27:12.310]  I feel like, honestly, a kettle would be more useful.
[27:13.050 --> 27:13.070]  Yeah.
[27:13.850 --> 27:15.630]  Well, how am I gonna heat the fucking kettle?
[27:15.630 --> 27:17.490]  I'd have to bring something else in.
[27:17.990 --> 27:21.030]  I don't have any... I can't naturally heat the kettle from my room.
[27:21.550 --> 27:24.670]  Just plug it in. Get an electric little tea kettle.
[27:25.010 --> 27:26.390]  I can get an... do I have those?
[27:26.750 --> 27:29.050]  Yeah, I have... that's what I make my coffee with.
[27:29.070 --> 27:31.410]  I use French press. It's what I make my coffee with every day.
[27:31.770 --> 27:34.330]  I thought you need to like put those on like an oven and then...
[27:34.730 --> 27:36.030]  No! That's a teapot!
[27:36.690 --> 27:37.630]  Oh, well, no.
[27:37.910 --> 27:39.270]  No, that's a tea kettle.
[27:39.470 --> 27:41.050]  That's a stove kettle. That's like a...
[27:41.050 --> 27:41.810]  Yeah, it's different.
[27:42.210 --> 27:43.310]  One with the whistles at the end.
[27:43.310 --> 27:46.950]  Yeah, you don't know you could electrically heat water. What do you think a microwave is doing?
[27:47.290 --> 27:50.730]  No, I know what a microwave is, but I don't want to put a whole microwave in here.
[27:50.770 --> 27:53.550]  If I could just get like a kettle, that's something to consider, but then...
[27:53.550 --> 27:57.170]  Yeah, you can get tea. You can get like instant coffee. You could do your ramen.
[27:57.770 --> 27:59.450]  Maybe a little curry pot.
[27:59.870 --> 28:02.470]  I feel like that's redundant though, now that I have a Keurig.
[28:03.470 --> 28:05.510]  I feel like I should have just bought that and not got a...
[28:05.510 --> 28:06.450]  Well, what's the difference?
[28:06.610 --> 28:07.390]  It's more specific.
[28:07.630 --> 28:11.790]  Yeah, I think a Keurig has narrowed you down in what you can achieve in your bedroom.
[28:11.790 --> 28:17.570]  Yeah, a Keurig is for one cup of coffee or one hot cocoa. In your case, I think hot cocoa.
[28:17.910 --> 28:21.170]  Ramen as well. The ramen turned out pretty good.
[28:21.410 --> 28:22.490]  It's not for ramen.
[28:23.150 --> 28:24.470]  It worked pretty good.
[28:24.810 --> 28:26.530]  My medium water...
[28:27.390 --> 28:32.810]  I'm gonna guess the amount of work you put in to make that ramen is way greater than it needed to
[28:32.810 --> 28:32.990]  be.
[28:33.350 --> 28:37.970]  What do you mean? I fucking... I opened the lid. I poured the packet in. I was very worried about
[28:37.970 --> 28:41.590]  what the strength meant. I put it on high heat and I clicked go. It was just like...
[28:42.110 --> 28:45.010]  Do you put the packet through the Keurig?
[28:45.890 --> 28:46.510]  What do you mean?
[28:47.230 --> 28:49.610]  What do you mean? I thought you were heating the water.
[28:50.330 --> 28:53.530]  Are you making the ramen in the Keurig machine?
[28:54.290 --> 28:59.130]  Well, I mean, I can't put the fucking ramen in the machine, but I just put it where the cup would go.
[28:59.250 --> 29:00.970]  Oh, I see. Okay. I thought...
[29:00.970 --> 29:02.210]  The way you said it...
[29:02.210 --> 29:02.770]  Like it was...
[29:02.770 --> 29:03.890]  The way you said it for a second...
[29:04.770 --> 29:06.270]  Yeah, you scared me for a second.
[29:06.270 --> 29:07.690]  No, I didn't dump the fucking ramen in the water.
[29:07.690 --> 29:11.330]  Put the ramen in the reservoir and just put spaghettis out the other end.
[29:12.830 --> 29:13.230]  Jesus.
[29:13.990 --> 29:19.290]  Honestly, Andrew, I think your life is overly complicated. The way you operate is absolute
[29:19.290 --> 29:20.230]  insanity. I think...
[29:20.770 --> 29:21.750]  How is that complicated?
[29:22.090 --> 29:25.370]  I think this will help you a lot. You need to move your bed to the kitchen.
[29:25.950 --> 29:30.190]  And I think all of your problems will go away. You're making it too complicated by bringing
[29:30.190 --> 29:31.870]  the kitchen to you. You need to go there.
[29:32.190 --> 29:32.570]  He's right.
[29:32.850 --> 29:33.250]  And sleep.
[29:33.870 --> 29:38.110]  How is this complicated, though? Explain to me how this is in any way complicated.
[29:38.390 --> 29:40.990]  Well, you blew a fuse for a start. You blew the breaker.
[29:40.990 --> 29:43.710]  Yeah, you lost 20 hours of Donkey Kong work, dude.
[29:43.870 --> 29:45.330]  Yeah, which you've now got to do again.
[29:45.890 --> 29:49.030]  So that you can save 30 seconds on a ramen packet.
[29:50.690 --> 29:54.270]  You cost yourself 20 hours. How many hours in that game were you?
[29:55.710 --> 29:58.110]  Easily, like, probably 25, I'd say.
[29:58.570 --> 30:04.510]  I think you should try it. Maybe start with a sleeping bag and then maybe work on putting a
[30:04.510 --> 30:05.530]  small bed in the kitchen.
[30:06.570 --> 30:10.350]  There's no... I love my bed so much and it wouldn't fit in a kitchen.
[30:10.350 --> 30:12.530]  It wouldn't fit in my kitchen, at least.
[30:12.750 --> 30:13.270]  What about the dining room?
[30:13.270 --> 30:13.790]  I could make this work.
[30:15.450 --> 30:18.750]  I don't... I really don't feel like I'm gaining anything here with this move.
[30:18.810 --> 30:20.570]  I feel like what I'm doing now is perfect.
[30:20.970 --> 30:23.050]  I mean, there are adjustments to definitely be made.
[30:23.210 --> 30:25.310]  I shimmy to my bed every day.
[30:25.990 --> 30:28.850]  I agree, like, there are things I need to adjust about my room.
[30:29.250 --> 30:32.650]  But I don't think moving to the kitchen solves that.
[30:33.970 --> 30:39.950]  Since you say your situation is perfect, but you have set off multiple fire alarms...
[30:39.950 --> 30:42.010]  You almost burned the place down.
[30:42.150 --> 30:44.050]  You had the whole waffle bomb scenario.
[30:44.650 --> 30:45.830]  You don't like...
[30:45.830 --> 30:47.770]  He had desk floor dogs.
[30:48.010 --> 30:49.690]  You had desk floor dogs.
[30:50.990 --> 30:55.770]  You're spending 10 times the amount of effort to make ramen noodles than you would be if you
[30:55.770 --> 30:56.750]  were just sleeping in the kitchen.
[30:57.090 --> 31:00.690]  And you're lucky you didn't burn your whole room down with that fan.
[31:01.670 --> 31:03.070]  It doesn't sound like it's going well.
[31:03.630 --> 31:05.610]  You know, things I think are going great.
[31:05.790 --> 31:07.830]  You guys are greatly overestimating.
[31:07.830 --> 31:10.050]  You just get trapped outside naked the other day.
[31:10.130 --> 31:11.690]  She had to show the delivery guy your dick.
[31:12.590 --> 31:15.210]  I don't understand what that has to do with my room.
[31:15.430 --> 31:15.810]  Nothing.
[31:16.010 --> 31:16.750]  That's just a thing that happens.
[31:17.870 --> 31:20.710]  I've never seen where Andrew lives.
[31:20.930 --> 31:26.450]  I'm picturing it as like a seven-story building with a different room on each floor.
[31:26.570 --> 31:28.310]  And each floor is just the size of one room.
[31:28.590 --> 31:31.730]  And it's so much effort for you to go to the kitchen for the bedroom.
[31:31.910 --> 31:32.530]  It's like a trek.
[31:32.590 --> 31:34.210]  You need to put on boots to do it or something.
[31:34.770 --> 31:36.030]  It is a real effort.
[31:36.430 --> 31:39.050]  And I don't think moving down there would be useful in any way.
[31:39.170 --> 31:40.390]  Why don't you just get a stair lift?
[31:40.710 --> 31:41.270]  A stair lift?
[31:41.350 --> 31:42.750]  Oh, like what is that?
[31:42.850 --> 31:43.570]  One of those chairs?
[31:44.110 --> 31:45.410]  Like a lady in Gremlin's head.
[31:45.810 --> 31:48.330]  Oh, nah, that doesn't... that seems like work.
[31:48.810 --> 31:50.250]  Do you hit a button at the top of the lift?
[31:50.970 --> 31:53.790]  The Keurig starts boiling the water by the time you get to the bottom.
[31:53.970 --> 31:56.450]  You just put a mug in and keep moving.
[31:56.950 --> 31:57.410]  It'll be great.
[31:58.290 --> 31:59.110]  I don't think so.
[31:59.450 --> 32:00.190]  I like my room.
[32:00.210 --> 32:04.210]  I need to move some things because I do, as I said, I shimmy to my bed every day.
[32:04.530 --> 32:05.730]  I need to move some things.
[32:06.170 --> 32:07.710]  But outside of that, it's great.
[32:08.190 --> 32:10.450]  It's interesting the life hacks that we share on this.
[32:10.590 --> 32:13.470]  Like Geoff's obviously got his full body blow dry.
[32:13.870 --> 32:16.290]  Andrew's got his kitchen in his bedroom.
[32:16.670 --> 32:17.870]  Yeah, what do you what do you have, Gavin?
[32:18.070 --> 32:20.750]  You have the bathroom, you grow mushrooms in the bathroom.
[32:21.510 --> 32:22.550]  I got the fungus.
[32:22.990 --> 32:24.690]  We need to combine rooms, Gavin.
[32:24.850 --> 32:26.650]  We've got a kitchen set up going on.
[32:26.690 --> 32:27.870]  I could use those mushrooms.
[32:28.070 --> 32:29.250]  Maybe we can make some sort of dish.
[32:29.530 --> 32:30.870]  Oh my God, it was so bad.
[32:31.330 --> 32:34.730]  I think my main life hack, the one I do, it's not a funny one.
[32:34.730 --> 32:38.110]  It's just very convenient because it's got rid of a problem that I used to always have,
[32:38.190 --> 32:44.150]  is that I keep a Phillips head screwdriver and a pair of scissors in almost every room
[32:44.150 --> 32:49.830]  because I constantly and I would not like to add up all the amount of time that I've
[32:49.830 --> 32:53.730]  spent looking for scissors in my life because it's like, I open this quickly with scissors,
[32:54.150 --> 32:54.570]  where are the scissors?
[32:54.690 --> 32:55.190]  No idea.
[32:55.330 --> 32:56.170]  Now they're everywhere.
[32:56.290 --> 32:58.270]  And the same with iPhone cables.
[32:58.730 --> 33:00.090]  I have the same thing with fingernail clippers.
[33:00.410 --> 33:03.830]  I probably have 20 pairs of fingernail clippers because when you need them, they're never there.
[33:04.730 --> 33:07.630]  When do you emergency need fingernail clippers?
[33:08.210 --> 33:09.930]  Surely you're just like, this is getting long.
[33:10.050 --> 33:10.410]  Let me just...
[33:11.230 --> 33:11.710]  All right.
[33:11.830 --> 33:12.650]  Here's here's.
[33:12.890 --> 33:13.390]  All right.
[33:13.530 --> 33:15.190]  Although you do compulsively trim.
[33:15.770 --> 33:17.930]  Yeah, I'm kind of compulsive about my nails.
[33:18.130 --> 33:19.210]  But then also there's...
[33:22.070 --> 33:23.790]  I don't know that we need to get into it today.
[33:23.930 --> 33:25.270]  I don't know that I want to get into the whole thing.
[33:25.430 --> 33:25.590]  Okay.
[33:25.930 --> 33:26.890]  You can trust us.
[33:27.270 --> 33:27.910]  I know.
[33:28.050 --> 33:30.970]  It's just that, like, I just really want to talk about the bats and Billy Ripken.
[33:31.070 --> 33:31.770]  This is gonna be a whole thing.
[33:31.950 --> 33:33.610]  You guys are gonna make fun of me for this and stuff.
[33:33.690 --> 33:34.150]  And I just...
[33:34.830 --> 33:38.330]  I can't cut my fingernails, all 10 fingernails at once.
[33:38.430 --> 33:39.030]  I get...
[33:40.110 --> 33:40.730]  You get bored?
[33:41.030 --> 33:41.570]  I get bored.
[33:43.210 --> 33:44.650]  I'm good for three.
[33:45.230 --> 33:46.310]  By the time I do...
[33:46.310 --> 33:47.170]  And I'll do two.
[33:47.170 --> 33:50.470]  I have a system right now where I'll do two on one hand and then one on the other.
[33:50.850 --> 33:52.190]  And then that's enough.
[33:52.350 --> 33:53.810]  And then I'll get to the rest later.
[33:53.950 --> 33:59.890]  And so I need to have fingernail clippers in my car and in my backpack and in my nightstand
[33:59.890 --> 34:02.450]  and in the bathroom and in the kitchen.
[34:02.870 --> 34:04.570]  How do you keep track of...
[34:04.570 --> 34:05.770]  Oh, that sounds like a nightmare.
[34:05.990 --> 34:09.430]  Surely you've got some fingers that haven't been trimmed for, like, a month
[34:09.430 --> 34:10.950]  and the other ones have got, like, a week on them.
[34:11.270 --> 34:12.090]  No, it's never...
[34:12.090 --> 34:13.530]  I don't let it get that out of control.
[34:13.730 --> 34:14.410]  But it's like...
[34:14.410 --> 34:15.890]  But the end result is...
[34:15.890 --> 34:17.930]  I have this problem with gas, too.
[34:18.350 --> 34:21.630]  Like, I have trouble sitting still while I'm pumping gas.
[34:22.110 --> 34:24.250]  So, like, I'll get to, like, a half a tank and I'll go,
[34:24.410 --> 34:24.890]  that's enough.
[34:25.070 --> 34:25.950]  I'll finish that later.
[34:26.270 --> 34:28.290]  And then I'll just get, like, a half a tank of gas and then leave.
[34:28.350 --> 34:28.850]  Because I just...
[34:29.350 --> 34:34.530]  It's so hard for me to sit still and just watch the fucking meter go up.
[34:34.890 --> 34:37.070]  I thought you were going to say, like, you couldn't fart all at once.
[34:37.350 --> 34:40.550]  I was really confused as to what gas was going to be.
[34:40.570 --> 34:42.650]  I have to release my farts in stages.
[34:43.350 --> 34:44.710]  No, it's just like...
[34:44.710 --> 34:46.510]  So how do you get by, like, brushing your teeth?
[34:46.570 --> 34:47.310]  Because that's boring.
[34:47.450 --> 34:49.870]  That's like, you've got to just sit there and do it.
[34:50.070 --> 34:51.730]  Do you just do half and then the rest later?
[34:52.670 --> 34:54.030]  No, I just...
[34:54.030 --> 34:54.710]  This is an uppercut.
[34:55.170 --> 34:56.430]  I just brush my teeth.
[34:56.670 --> 34:57.410]  It's like, that's what...
[34:57.410 --> 34:58.650]  It's like some shit you just got to do.
[34:58.850 --> 35:02.050]  That takes longer than cutting all ten fingers.
[35:02.270 --> 35:02.830]  Oh, for sure.
[35:03.330 --> 35:03.550]  Totally.
[35:04.110 --> 35:04.450]  Yeah, it sucks.
[35:04.570 --> 35:04.990]  How many nails...
[35:04.990 --> 35:06.090]  So you do three nails.
[35:06.890 --> 35:07.430]  So this is...
[35:07.430 --> 35:07.730]  Sometimes more.
[35:08.050 --> 35:08.610]  I've done...
[35:08.610 --> 35:09.490]  There are times...
[35:09.490 --> 35:10.210]  I'm sorry, what's that?
[35:10.450 --> 35:12.350]  Is it like once a day you do three?
[35:12.510 --> 35:13.730]  Or, like, what is the average?
[35:13.770 --> 35:15.550]  How long does it take for you to do all your nails on average?
[35:15.770 --> 35:16.650]  Oh, less than a week.
[35:17.930 --> 35:18.990]  Less than a week?
[35:19.510 --> 35:20.350]  What do you mean?
[35:21.230 --> 35:22.190]  Less than a week?
[35:23.070 --> 35:23.710]  I would...
[35:23.710 --> 35:25.170]  I really want to see your calendar.
[35:25.810 --> 35:26.850]  I can't make this meeting.
[35:27.630 --> 35:29.490]  Trim the ring finger and the little finger.
[35:29.850 --> 35:34.830]  Like, I can tell right now my right thumbnail and my left pinky nail are too...
[35:34.830 --> 35:35.390]  I need to be...
[35:35.390 --> 35:35.830]  That...
[35:35.830 --> 35:37.950]  The out of synchness would drive me apeshit.
[35:38.370 --> 35:41.530]  It takes maximum 90 seconds to do all ten.
[35:41.630 --> 35:42.670]  Oh, it's the worst.
[35:42.930 --> 35:43.630]  So boring.
[35:43.970 --> 35:44.790]  I can't do it.
[35:45.190 --> 35:47.070]  So, you know, maybe I'll do it like...
[35:47.070 --> 35:48.110]  I'll do it in like an hour.
[35:48.250 --> 35:49.230]  I go back and do a few more.
[35:49.470 --> 35:50.250]  Sometimes I'll do more.
[35:50.350 --> 35:51.890]  I have done all ten at once.
[35:51.990 --> 35:52.990]  I just don't...
[35:52.990 --> 35:53.370]  I just...
[35:53.370 --> 35:54.110]  I wouldn't say...
[35:54.110 --> 35:56.710]  I'd say, like, maybe twice a year.
[35:56.710 --> 35:57.870]  How long does it take?
[35:58.870 --> 35:59.510]  A couple seconds.
[35:59.550 --> 36:00.410]  You're just like...
[36:00.830 --> 36:03.490]  Whenever I get annoyed by one finger, I'll just go do that finger.
[36:03.570 --> 36:04.370]  And then I'll go like...
[36:04.370 --> 36:06.130]  Well, now the rest are long.
[36:06.350 --> 36:06.990]  And then I'll go like...
[36:06.990 --> 36:09.530]  Well, I'll just do, like, the two that are the longest.
[36:09.790 --> 36:11.450]  And then that's good for a while.
[36:11.570 --> 36:12.870]  And then, like, three days later, I'll go like...
[36:12.870 --> 36:13.730]  Oh, I noticed this one's gone.
[36:13.870 --> 36:14.770]  So I'd say about a week.
[36:14.810 --> 36:15.970]  I cut all my fingernails.
[36:17.090 --> 36:17.430]  Oh, my God.
[36:17.430 --> 36:18.790]  Maybe less than a week.
[36:19.310 --> 36:20.930]  Anyway, I don't want to talk about that.
[36:21.230 --> 36:22.370]  That makes me sound weird.
[36:22.990 --> 36:23.390]  What's that?
[36:23.930 --> 36:26.530]  The hassle of having to cut one fingernail.
[36:27.110 --> 36:28.250]  It's just awful.
[36:28.470 --> 36:28.790]  Yeah.
[36:29.670 --> 36:30.390]  Oh, my God.
[36:30.770 --> 36:31.150]  I know.
[36:31.270 --> 36:35.370]  I know it costs me more time in the long run because of setup and teardown, right?
[36:35.610 --> 36:38.990]  I feel like there's a small period after you've done your fingernails where
[36:38.990 --> 36:42.190]  you've got to get used to them being a little bit shorter than they were.
[36:42.270 --> 36:43.830]  And that's like a little bit of adjustment.
[36:43.910 --> 36:45.710]  But you must be constantly adjusting to that.
[36:46.150 --> 36:46.650]  Yeah, probably.
[36:47.530 --> 36:49.390]  There are days when I just can't take it.
[36:49.410 --> 36:51.930]  And I'm like, oh, I hate how this finger is shorter than the others.
[36:52.090 --> 36:54.490]  And I'll just, like, buckle down and cut the rest of them.
[36:54.490 --> 36:55.470]  This is insane to me.
[36:55.470 --> 36:57.450]  This is one of the most mental things you've ever said.
[36:57.570 --> 36:58.110]  You are right.
[36:58.210 --> 37:00.510]  Yeah, I'm going to make fun of you for this.
[37:00.550 --> 37:01.170]  You're absolutely right.
[37:01.370 --> 37:02.470]  That was crazy.
[37:02.850 --> 37:04.670]  I didn't really want to go there.
[37:05.950 --> 37:08.570]  It certainly wasn't where I wanted to take today's podcast.
[37:11.050 --> 37:14.070]  As somebody who's saying that you're just as weird,
[37:14.170 --> 37:16.450]  and it's just taking a longer time for it to come out.
[37:16.650 --> 37:17.390]  You're on a roll.
[37:17.590 --> 37:18.930]  You're on a roll with this nail thing, too.
[37:19.270 --> 37:20.470]  I don't think that's weird.
[37:20.610 --> 37:22.470]  I think I just have a short attention span.
[37:23.210 --> 37:25.570]  Yeah, but your attention span is so long on other things.
[37:25.570 --> 37:25.890]  There's a ritual for it.
[37:26.110 --> 37:27.990]  Yeah, and it's like a whole process.
[37:28.550 --> 37:30.130]  You've put so much thought into this.
[37:30.890 --> 37:31.510]  So much thought into what?
[37:32.330 --> 37:33.090]  Cutting your nails.
[37:33.450 --> 37:34.670]  The amount of thought and effort.
[37:34.670 --> 37:35.590]  It's not a lot of thought.
[37:35.750 --> 37:36.430]  It really isn't.
[37:36.510 --> 37:36.810]  It's a whole process.
[37:37.090 --> 37:40.350]  The nice thing about my brain is it can do two things at once most of the time, too.
[37:40.450 --> 37:43.890]  So it's not like it requires all of my mental faculties to deal with the fingernails.
[37:44.310 --> 37:48.330]  I bet, because this is F*** Face, and we have a wonderful F*** Face audience,
[37:48.530 --> 37:51.870]  I bet we're going to see a bunch of those comment leavers
[37:52.630 --> 37:54.950]  saying that they also do the same thing with their nails.
[37:56.030 --> 37:59.970]  I'm going to guess that I get less positive feedback
[38:01.250 --> 38:04.250]  about the fingernails than I did about the nose flaps,
[38:04.470 --> 38:07.710]  but way more than I did about the left sock.
[38:08.090 --> 38:09.090]  I think it'll be in the middle.
[38:09.670 --> 38:11.610]  A lot of people have taken objection to Eric's statement.
[38:11.750 --> 38:12.490]  Eric, did you see this?
[38:12.550 --> 38:15.010]  There's a lot of comment leavers, Eric,
[38:15.410 --> 38:19.250]  who are saying that they are actually normal people leaving comments.
[38:19.250 --> 38:22.150]  Well, yeah, that's what comment leavers would say.
[38:22.670 --> 38:27.370]  That's the thing about comment leavers is that they don't see themselves as comment leavers.
[38:27.910 --> 38:28.910]  That's the hard part.
[38:29.050 --> 38:33.170]  That's the thing they have to overcome and understand is that they are just own it.
[38:33.250 --> 38:33.690]  That's OK.
[38:33.950 --> 38:36.350]  If you're going to leave comments, be a comment leaver.
[38:36.910 --> 38:39.050]  But, you know, don't tell me that you're not in the comments.
[38:39.270 --> 38:39.790]  That's...

[39:53.590 --> 39:55.110]  Crazy. What are you doing?
[39:57.930 --> 40:02.330]  Speaking of the comment leavers, those people also tend to buy bats.
[40:02.670 --> 40:05.130]  And should we talk about how the fucking bats went?
[40:05.490 --> 40:05.770]  Yeah.
[40:05.970 --> 40:09.370]  They were on sale for like eight seconds or something.
[40:09.990 --> 40:12.050]  I think... I don't know that...
[40:12.050 --> 40:14.890]  I think somebody told me 7 or 13 seconds.
[40:15.030 --> 40:18.670]  I don't know that they can get that down to the second with the detail.
[40:19.090 --> 40:21.930]  But they went out of stock immediately.
[40:22.830 --> 40:23.050]  Oops.
[40:23.530 --> 40:26.050]  And there were some questions as to how many were for sale.
[40:26.870 --> 40:29.870]  I think I made 50.
[40:29.990 --> 40:39.010]  The ones I made for you and Nick and Andrew and Eric were outside of the 50.
[40:39.390 --> 40:40.810]  I had extra bats.
[40:40.810 --> 40:43.650]  So the ones I made for us and the one I made for me as well,
[40:43.730 --> 40:46.450]  those are not a part of the 51 that I made.
[40:46.530 --> 40:49.790]  So I think out of the 51 that were for sale,
[40:49.890 --> 40:56.050]  49 of them went for sale because one went to Jack and one went to Rebecca in England.
[40:56.530 --> 40:56.930]  So yeah.
[40:57.010 --> 41:00.310]  So I think it was 49 bats that went on sale and they sold out in...
[41:00.310 --> 41:00.750]  I don't know.
[41:00.830 --> 41:01.690]  Fucking nothing.
[41:01.830 --> 41:02.130]  No time.
[41:02.210 --> 41:02.990]  Like less than a minute.
[41:03.230 --> 41:03.650]  10 seconds.
[41:03.870 --> 41:04.230]  That's crazy.
[41:04.410 --> 41:05.550]  They're like super rare.
[41:06.150 --> 41:07.290]  Yeah, that is really crazy.
[41:07.990 --> 41:09.330]  And I feel bad about it.
[41:09.330 --> 41:13.990]  I'm excited about it because I'm excited that people thought enough of the whole thing to buy
[41:13.990 --> 41:14.150]  them.
[41:14.590 --> 41:18.350]  But so we feel bad about it because a lot of people wanted to get bats that couldn't.
[41:18.410 --> 41:20.410]  So I think we're looking into it right now.
[41:20.610 --> 41:23.530]  But we're looking at making like a second run of bats.
[41:23.810 --> 41:29.030]  But then I don't want the first bat people to feel any less special for their bat.
[41:29.130 --> 41:31.130]  So the new bats that we make would be different.
[41:31.330 --> 41:32.410]  Like we'll do a different design.
[41:32.630 --> 41:33.230]  Like shit, yeah.
[41:33.770 --> 41:34.630]  Yeah, well, that would be different.
[41:34.710 --> 41:37.490]  But maybe the colors, like the colorways would be different on it, you know?
[41:37.830 --> 41:38.890]  It would be like a pair of Jordans.
[41:39.390 --> 41:42.650]  I saw a picture of the one where you wrote f***face on it.
[41:42.770 --> 41:44.350]  I guess that's the person who wrote that one.
[41:44.490 --> 41:45.170]  That's number one, yeah.
[41:45.750 --> 41:47.450]  Boy, did you make a dog's dinner of that.
[41:47.750 --> 41:49.550]  I can see why you switched to numbers.
[41:50.950 --> 41:51.830]  No, you're right.
[41:52.030 --> 41:54.090]  And that's blown up, dude.
[41:54.130 --> 41:54.970]  That thing is tiny.
[41:55.250 --> 41:56.510]  Like, you know how big your bat is.
[41:57.050 --> 41:59.490]  Now transpose it to look at it, like look at your knob and think,
[41:59.550 --> 42:01.530]  how did he write those eight fucking letters on that thing?
[42:01.610 --> 42:02.330]  There's no room.
[42:02.810 --> 42:03.230]  It's brutal.
[42:03.750 --> 42:05.630]  And I won't burn, and I'm not burning shit anymore.
[42:05.630 --> 42:06.770]  Not the next one.
[42:06.850 --> 42:09.290]  The next one will not be hand-numbered by Geoff.
[42:09.690 --> 42:12.850]  Maybe we'll have an autograph card in it, and we'll all autograph it or something,
[42:13.010 --> 42:14.590]  but I'm not numbering anymore for a while.
[42:14.850 --> 42:17.410]  The next one will just be f***ing bats, and they'll be cheaper.
[42:18.690 --> 42:20.850]  And people, they'll be available for people to get.
[42:21.010 --> 42:22.050]  Who wants that?
[42:22.730 --> 42:23.050]  Yeah.
[42:23.070 --> 42:24.610]  The people that get the first bat.
[42:24.630 --> 42:26.930]  The pain and the turmoil is why people bought them.
[42:27.370 --> 42:31.210]  I really, I feel like you're overvaluing how many people wanted actual bats.
[42:31.590 --> 42:34.030]  The bats, I feel like, the actual material.
[42:34.450 --> 42:35.730]  I don't think it matters that much.
[42:35.750 --> 42:37.110]  And they don't function as bats.
[42:37.510 --> 42:37.770]  No.
[42:38.970 --> 42:41.750]  I think there has to be a level of suffering, Geoff, for this game.
[42:41.750 --> 42:43.350]  All right, I don't want to number them, though.
[42:43.470 --> 42:44.230]  I can burn them.
[42:44.370 --> 42:45.130]  I just want to do it differently.
[42:45.130 --> 42:46.310]  Why don't you brand them?
[42:47.190 --> 42:47.830]  That's a great idea.
[42:48.310 --> 42:50.030]  Well, I just don't want it to suck.
[42:50.090 --> 42:51.630]  I don't want to lose a whole weekend again.
[42:54.750 --> 42:57.670]  It took you a whole weekend to number 50 bats?
[42:58.290 --> 42:59.510]  Uh, in stages.
[43:00.310 --> 43:01.550]  Because I get bored.
[43:02.070 --> 43:04.490]  I was about to say, I just talked to the fucking,
[43:04.610 --> 43:06.330]  it takes you a week to do your fingernails.
[43:06.430 --> 43:10.330]  Why am I shocked that it took you a whole weekend for 50 bats?
[43:10.350 --> 43:12.690]  In my head, I would spend an hour sanding the bottoms,
[43:12.890 --> 43:15.110]  and then I would spend maybe 90 minutes numbering them.
[43:15.250 --> 43:15.930]  In my head, that's how it's gonna go.
[43:15.930 --> 43:17.390]  Oh, way more than 90 minutes.
[43:17.410 --> 43:17.690]  No.
[43:17.950 --> 43:18.190]  It's a thing.
[43:18.330 --> 43:19.450]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:19.470 --> 43:19.750]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:19.750 --> 43:20.710]  I guarantee it.
[43:21.030 --> 43:22.470]  You're dealing with magnifying...
[43:22.470 --> 43:23.130]  Oh, you know what?
[43:23.870 --> 43:26.270]  With a wood burner and a magnifying glass,
[43:26.430 --> 43:27.970]  and, like, all these tools,
[43:28.090 --> 43:29.770]  and the wood burner gets overheated,
[43:29.910 --> 43:31.290]  and then it burns too fast,
[43:31.290 --> 43:33.210]  so you gotta take breaks and unplug it for a while,
[43:33.370 --> 43:34.710]  and let it cool down, and then burn it.
[43:34.950 --> 43:35.530]  Like, it's a whole...
[43:35.530 --> 43:37.250]  It was... I got it down to a science.
[43:37.430 --> 43:40.730]  I would say from bat 30 to 51,
[43:40.990 --> 43:42.110]  I was fucking humming.
[43:42.950 --> 43:44.250]  But those first 30 were rough.
[43:44.950 --> 43:46.910]  I could do the lot in half a day.
[43:47.070 --> 43:48.450]  Well, then you're gonna do the next batch.
[43:48.890 --> 43:49.130]  All right.
[43:49.670 --> 43:51.590]  All right, I have all the equipment.
[43:51.770 --> 43:52.690]  I'll drop it off at your house.
[43:53.170 --> 43:53.950]  How much is the lot?
[43:54.770 --> 43:56.270]  Are we doing, like, another 50?
[43:56.430 --> 43:57.010]  Is that by a lot?
[43:57.010 --> 43:57.670]  No, we would do...
[43:57.670 --> 43:59.030]  I would say we'd probably do 200.
[43:59.450 --> 44:00.270]  100 or 200.
[44:00.270 --> 44:01.650]  There were at least that many people.
[44:02.270 --> 44:03.970]  Does that change your scale, Gavin,
[44:04.070 --> 44:05.130]  for how long you think it would take?
[44:05.390 --> 44:06.850]  Nah, I'll get them done.
[44:07.210 --> 44:07.550]  I love it.
[44:07.550 --> 44:10.390]  I think I could do 200 bats in, like, three hours.
[44:10.590 --> 44:12.850]  If I'm just numbering them, that seems super easy.
[44:13.350 --> 44:14.330]  Should we briefly...
[44:14.330 --> 44:16.150]  With all this confidence flying around the room,
[44:16.250 --> 44:18.090]  do we want to briefly mention that,
[44:18.130 --> 44:20.570]  in between the last recording and this one, Geoff,
[44:22.170 --> 44:24.450]  Andrew suggested a third burger bet,
[44:24.710 --> 44:26.770]  and then turned his back on it immediately?
[44:27.210 --> 44:29.090]  Oh my god, I forgot.
[44:29.310 --> 44:30.050]  What was that?
[44:30.050 --> 44:32.370]  Was that, like, a momentary lapse in sanity?
[44:32.910 --> 44:33.790]  That was so weird.
[44:34.010 --> 44:35.490]  I felt so bad that he was gonna...
[44:35.490 --> 44:37.270]  basically, it was gonna be double or nothing again,
[44:38.330 --> 44:39.810]  and I just couldn't...
[44:39.810 --> 44:40.970]  I couldn't let him go through with it.
[44:41.030 --> 44:43.650]  I was like, I don't care what you've thought of.
[44:43.730 --> 44:45.450]  It still isn't gonna happen.
[44:45.610 --> 44:46.910]  It just seemed desperate.
[44:47.090 --> 44:48.450]  I wasn't sure what was going on.
[44:48.590 --> 44:50.590]  No, there was no desperation at all.
[44:50.690 --> 44:51.410]  It was... I was...
[44:51.410 --> 44:53.150]  I woke up really early that day,
[44:53.230 --> 44:53.950]  I was in the shower,
[44:54.050 --> 44:55.090]  and I was like, you know what?
[44:55.310 --> 44:56.910]  Those burgers are no fucking problem.
[44:56.910 --> 44:58.210]  I can eat those burgers.
[44:58.510 --> 45:00.570]  No problem at all.
[45:00.670 --> 45:01.570]  You've done it twice.
[45:02.170 --> 45:03.230]  Yeah, yeah.
[45:03.410 --> 45:05.210]  I had a slight adjustment.
[45:05.370 --> 45:06.150]  I was like, you know what?
[45:06.290 --> 45:07.470]  This is a mental game,
[45:07.510 --> 45:10.210]  and I think if I make this small change,
[45:10.550 --> 45:11.670]  I can make this work.
[45:12.150 --> 45:12.910]  I think I'm good.
[45:13.230 --> 45:14.930]  I had so much burger confidence
[45:14.930 --> 45:18.290]  from between, like, 4am until, like, 9am.
[45:18.630 --> 45:20.750]  Then it began to reduce a little bit,
[45:20.830 --> 45:22.610]  and then I had a burger in the evening,
[45:22.870 --> 45:23.790]  and it was shot.
[45:23.930 --> 45:25.890]  It was shot, but then I had one burger,
[45:25.890 --> 45:28.350]  and I was like, I was grounded back to reality.
[45:28.770 --> 45:31.190]  Because you were aggressively confident for a little bit.
[45:31.190 --> 45:34.370]  I felt really good about it from 4am to 7am.
[45:34.390 --> 45:35.150]  It was on Monday.
[45:35.410 --> 45:37.310]  You started the text conversation with,
[45:37.510 --> 45:39.930]  I'm feeling spicy this morning, Gavin.
[45:40.870 --> 45:43.130]  Geoff replies with, what does that even mean?
[45:43.290 --> 45:46.010]  Andrew says, 25 double burgers,
[45:46.570 --> 45:48.510]  round three, double or nothing again,
[45:48.670 --> 45:50.910]  but if I lose, we bump it from a pencil
[45:50.910 --> 45:52.970]  to a 30 centimeter ruler.
[45:53.270 --> 45:55.470]  The burger confidence is back.
[45:55.470 --> 45:56.990]  I have a new strategy.
[45:57.870 --> 45:59.830]  Geoff's saying, that's a ton more wood.
[46:01.590 --> 46:03.110]  That's so much wood and a ruler.
[46:04.430 --> 46:06.730]  Yeah, and then I think, so that was at 9am.
[46:08.950 --> 46:09.830]  Uh, by...
[46:09.830 --> 46:11.010]  Oh, it went down a little bit.
[46:11.550 --> 46:13.530]  Oh yeah, when the burger confidence hits,
[46:13.610 --> 46:14.650]  there's no stopping it.
[46:14.830 --> 46:17.230]  That was about three in the afternoon.
[46:18.690 --> 46:21.890]  By 7.30, the burgers are off the table.
[46:22.230 --> 46:22.810]  Not possible.
[46:27.060 --> 46:29.800]  What happened was, I was like a fighter
[46:29.800 --> 46:32.320]  who's in retirement and just got a little
[46:32.320 --> 46:33.200]  excited for a minute.
[46:33.340 --> 46:35.520]  And I did one sparring round and I realized,
[46:35.700 --> 46:38.680]  this is not, I'm talking beyond my depth.
[46:38.700 --> 46:41.360]  It's ever a big deal when a boxer who's
[46:41.360 --> 46:43.440]  never won a fight comes out of retirement.
[46:43.880 --> 46:45.660]  I never said it was a big deal.
[46:46.020 --> 46:48.220]  I just said, I felt like I could finally win one.
[46:48.240 --> 46:49.140]  I know what you mean.
[46:49.140 --> 46:50.060]  I know what you mean, Andrew.
[46:50.160 --> 46:52.120]  Every once in a while, I go to the beach
[46:52.120 --> 46:54.380]  and I'll think, I'm going to go surfing again.
[46:54.380 --> 46:57.080]  And then I get to the moment when it's
[46:57.080 --> 46:58.780]  time to surf and I go, that's a lot of work.
[46:59.960 --> 47:00.560]  You know what?
[47:01.700 --> 47:02.040]  Nevermind.
[47:02.180 --> 47:03.400]  So we'll leave it to my youth.
[47:03.960 --> 47:06.600]  What was the revelation you had that didn't pay off?
[47:07.640 --> 47:09.340]  Well, I mean, you bring up a great point,
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.700]  Gavin, and that you'd think that me never
[47:11.700 --> 47:13.580]  being successful at it would make me less
[47:13.580 --> 47:15.620]  motivated, but it just makes me want to do it more.
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.800]  I feel like it's this mountain I'm going to
[47:17.800 --> 47:18.680]  eventually climb.
[47:18.760 --> 47:19.800]  I just haven't got there yet.
[47:20.900 --> 47:23.000]  And your question was, what made me realize,
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.420]  what was my sparring session?
[47:25.480 --> 47:26.900]  Is that what you're asking?
[47:27.280 --> 47:29.480]  I guess you've already explained what brought it on.
[47:30.700 --> 47:32.680]  There was nothing that brought it on.
[47:32.860 --> 47:34.660]  I just felt I had the burger confidence.
[47:34.880 --> 47:37.080]  I woke up with the burger in my mind.
[47:37.220 --> 47:38.680]  I was like, I bet I could fucking do this.
[47:39.020 --> 47:39.940]  Let's do this.
[47:40.220 --> 47:42.700]  But that's why it's not gone.
[47:43.020 --> 47:44.420]  This is not going to happen.
[47:45.000 --> 47:45.800]  We have a deal.
[47:45.900 --> 47:48.120]  We have the framework of a deal in place now.
[47:48.400 --> 47:50.900]  And when I get that burger confidence back,
[47:51.020 --> 47:52.780]  I can just roll with it.
[47:52.780 --> 47:54.040]  I don't even need to talk to you.
[47:54.080 --> 47:54.960]  There's no negotiating.
[47:55.220 --> 47:57.060]  But your stomach is the same size.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.820]  Yeah, but this is a mental game, I think.
[48:01.120 --> 48:02.240]  And I just need to get there.
[48:02.300 --> 48:03.520]  That was a big factor of it.
[48:03.800 --> 48:05.680]  If I'm going to do this, it's going to be a day
[48:05.680 --> 48:08.260]  where I have ridiculous amounts of confidence about it.
[48:08.480 --> 48:10.140]  And I didn't have that after eating that burger.
[48:10.480 --> 48:11.280]  I felt a little full.
[48:11.600 --> 48:15.040]  I can't believe I'm saying this, but Gavin,
[48:15.100 --> 48:16.180]  I think he's 100% right.
[48:16.300 --> 48:17.280]  I do think it's all mental.
[48:17.780 --> 48:20.360]  And if he can strike while the confidence is high,
[48:20.360 --> 48:21.960]  like if you would have...
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.080]  The reality is, Andrew,
[48:23.400 --> 48:24.880]  if when you woke up that morning
[48:24.880 --> 48:26.400]  and you felt that burger confidence,
[48:26.740 --> 48:28.400]  if you'd immediately placed that order
[48:28.400 --> 48:30.700]  and had those burgers in your house within an hour,
[48:30.900 --> 48:32.420]  you probably could have done it right then.
[48:33.040 --> 48:36.140]  I would have had a huge start without a doubt.
[48:36.360 --> 48:37.800]  And that's all I think I need.
[48:37.860 --> 48:39.620]  I think I just need that initial momentum
[48:39.620 --> 48:40.900]  and I can carry the rest of the way
[48:40.900 --> 48:42.260]  because I was close last time.
[48:42.700 --> 48:44.180]  It wasn't like I missed it by a lot.
[48:44.260 --> 48:45.140]  I was pretty close.
[48:45.800 --> 48:47.980]  You weren't close enough to try it again.
[48:48.860 --> 48:49.220]  Yeah.
[48:49.220 --> 48:52.100]  I had like 42 of the patties.
[48:52.240 --> 48:53.500]  That's pretty good.
[48:53.820 --> 48:55.520]  The patty is part of the burger.
[48:55.720 --> 48:57.620]  You're saying it like you had 42 burgers.
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.980]  You had 42 patties.
[48:59.320 --> 49:02.220]  You also lost count to like a factor of two.
[49:02.380 --> 49:03.960]  You thought you were eating singles
[49:03.960 --> 49:05.060]  thinking they were full burgers.
[49:05.180 --> 49:06.560]  Your math was so wrong.
[49:07.080 --> 49:08.440]  My math was really wrong.
[49:08.540 --> 49:10.720]  But once again, that just it's a confidence thing.
[49:10.780 --> 49:12.260]  I don't need the math for it to be right.
[49:12.420 --> 49:14.920]  Like if anything, my math being bad just makes it better.
[49:15.220 --> 49:16.340]  I think you've lost the plot
[49:16.340 --> 49:17.560]  and I think you're going to try again.
[49:17.640 --> 49:18.360]  You're going to lose again.
[49:18.360 --> 49:20.220]  You're going to say, I'm never trying this again.
[49:20.340 --> 49:22.260]  Six months down the line, burger round four.
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.380]  I think we're in a constant f*** face cycle here.
[49:25.960 --> 49:28.360]  Until I do it, I think, yeah, it's going to be a thing.
[49:28.400 --> 49:29.100]  And it can be done.
[49:29.220 --> 49:31.120]  Like people have eaten way more burgers.
[49:31.420 --> 49:35.120]  It's not an impossible thing, but it'll happen one day.
[49:35.720 --> 49:36.600]  I will climb that mountain.
[49:36.700 --> 49:37.640]  I will climb Burger Mountain.
[49:38.060 --> 49:40.720]  Dude, do you have a ruler in your hand?
[49:40.780 --> 49:42.520]  Like a 30 centimeter ruler in your hand?
[49:43.340 --> 49:45.960]  I, uh, no, but I distinctly...
[49:46.600 --> 49:47.060]  Do you own one?
[49:47.060 --> 49:48.600]  No, I used...
[49:48.600 --> 49:49.520]  Okay, they're so big.
[49:50.080 --> 49:51.720]  No, they're not that big.
[49:52.380 --> 49:54.660]  That's like five pencils worth of wood, man.
[49:56.440 --> 49:58.020]  I have, I have a...
[49:58.020 --> 50:02.080]  When I was in the third grade, my teacher yelled a lot
[50:02.080 --> 50:04.540]  and then I'd get upset about it, even though I was like a really good kid.
[50:04.860 --> 50:05.900]  I just didn't make me uncomfortable.
[50:06.040 --> 50:06.900]  I didn't like the conflict.
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.940]  So they try to like go the extra effort in connecting with me.
[50:11.240 --> 50:14.920]  And there was one time where they're trying to prove some point about like,
[50:15.900 --> 50:17.660]  leverage, I guess, was the lesson.
[50:18.160 --> 50:19.880]  And I had a wooden ruler and they knew it.
[50:20.340 --> 50:21.900]  And they said, try to break your ruler.
[50:22.520 --> 50:24.000]  And they knew I couldn't.
[50:24.100 --> 50:25.840]  They knew I wouldn't be able to with my hands.
[50:26.300 --> 50:27.620]  And so they're like, try to break your ruler.
[50:27.740 --> 50:28.920]  And so like, I'm trying my hands.
[50:29.420 --> 50:30.960]  And then they continue on with their lesson.
[50:31.220 --> 50:33.060]  And then I thought, well, he wants me to...
[50:33.060 --> 50:33.620]  I misinterpreted.
[50:33.640 --> 50:35.220]  I thought he actually wanted me to break my ruler.
[50:35.580 --> 50:37.840]  So then I put it on my knee and I cracked it in half.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.120]  And the crack was so loud.
[50:40.140 --> 50:44.000]  And it just echoed through the room and everyone went quiet.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.800]  And the teacher just had like the biggest sigh of just like...
[50:50.240 --> 50:51.680]  Did he try and make you eat it?
[50:51.880 --> 50:52.980]  Is this like...
[50:52.980 --> 50:54.500]  No, no, no.
[50:54.680 --> 50:55.540]  But he was just so disappointed.
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.760]  I'm saying like, I have a ruler in my mind because of that experience.
[50:59.960 --> 51:00.380]  I got you.
[51:00.460 --> 51:02.180]  It's stuck in my ruler story.
[51:02.720 --> 51:03.460]  So it is cemented.
[51:03.540 --> 51:04.880]  I know what I'm dealing with with a ruler.
[51:05.000 --> 51:05.740]  It was mainly my point.
[51:06.160 --> 51:07.240]  I don't think you should eat one.
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.120]  Well, I don't think I should eat a pencil either.
[51:09.240 --> 51:11.380]  But like at a certain point, it doesn't matter.
[51:11.380 --> 51:14.900]  I think if you gave yourself six months to fully finish the pencil,
[51:15.020 --> 51:15.780]  you could do it without.
[51:16.240 --> 51:18.720]  I'm saying I think the shavings are the way to go with that.
[51:18.820 --> 51:19.540]  Bit of garnish.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.440]  I wonder what's more dangerous for your body.
[51:22.600 --> 51:27.480]  Like what's less healthy, eating a ruler or eating 50 burgers?
[51:27.920 --> 51:29.920]  Oh, I'd say the burgers.
[51:30.460 --> 51:34.180]  I think the burger splinters would be an issue.
[51:34.540 --> 51:34.980]  Yeah.
[51:36.560 --> 51:37.940]  He's not like a beaver.
[51:37.960 --> 51:39.360]  So much what a ruler, Andrew.
[51:39.480 --> 51:40.640]  I know you know what one is.
[51:40.640 --> 51:42.540]  But it's a lot of wood.
[51:42.820 --> 51:45.780]  Also, when you fail this bet, what's the what's round four going to be?
[51:45.840 --> 51:48.020]  You're going to just like eat the contents of a pencil case.
[51:48.160 --> 51:48.900]  Where does it end?
[51:49.240 --> 51:50.660]  No, that's what in my head.
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.220]  I kind of like the idea of elevating it every time to eventually just be a door to where we start.
[51:55.660 --> 51:56.680]  To where it stops.
[51:56.840 --> 51:57.900]  It can't be the door.
[52:00.180 --> 52:01.620]  I think that'd be the goal.
[52:01.760 --> 52:02.480]  That'd be the dream.
[52:02.760 --> 52:05.400]  But yeah, there is burger confidence and it faded.
[52:05.520 --> 52:06.680]  But we have something on the table.
[52:06.780 --> 52:09.920]  So next time I really feel it, I'll just go.
[52:09.920 --> 52:13.720]  Yeah, I think you're you got to start strike when the iron's hot.
[52:14.060 --> 52:14.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[52:15.400 --> 52:15.860]  For sure.
[52:17.320 --> 52:23.320]  Oh, another thing, since we're talking about bats, Billy Ripken.
[52:24.020 --> 52:24.500]  Yes.
[52:24.640 --> 52:25.980]  Kind of the namesake of this podcast.
[52:25.980 --> 52:30.800]  If you don't know, we got we got the name because he the idea for the name of the podcast came from
[52:30.800 --> 52:37.280]  Billy Ripken wrote Face on a baseball bat, and they ended up making a 1989 Fleer baseball card out of it.
[52:37.320 --> 52:39.900]  It became an error and highly sought after in the 80s.
[52:40.480 --> 52:47.940]  Anyway, I have a real fucking problem that's not related to dog shit or plumbing or my girlfriend
[52:47.940 --> 52:53.420]  shit or any of that. The problem I have is that Andrew and this podcast have started me on a
[52:53.420 --> 52:56.460]  fucking dark path of collecting cards again.
[52:56.740 --> 53:00.600]  And it is not I don't have a healthy relationship with it.
[53:01.480 --> 53:07.800]  But a part of that is that I spend way, way, way, way, way too much of my free time lurking in
[53:07.800 --> 53:11.000]  baseball and basketball card forums across the Internet.
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.160]  Now, I spent a lot of my free time. I feel really bad because I used to lurk in architectural
[53:17.160 --> 53:20.200]  forums about Austin, just like all the Austin skyscrapers and stuff going up.
[53:20.320 --> 53:24.340]  And I've completely avoided that community now for the basketball card community.
[53:24.840 --> 53:29.200]  However, in the process of this, I noticed, especially over the holiday break,
[53:29.360 --> 53:33.520]  on like four different threads, two on Reddit and two on other websites,
[53:33.520 --> 53:39.000]  where people were talking about this Billy Ripken face card and they couldn't figure out
[53:39.540 --> 53:40.940]  why it's worth so much money.
[53:41.120 --> 53:46.140]  All of a sudden, it used to go. It used to go for like twenty, twenty five bucks.
[53:46.160 --> 53:48.840]  And now people are saying it's on eBay for like three hundred dollars.
[53:48.900 --> 53:50.760]  And people are like, what the fuck happened?
[53:50.900 --> 53:53.260]  This has always been a funny joke card, but it's never.
[53:53.360 --> 53:55.320]  It hasn't been worth anything in like 20 years.
[53:55.320 --> 53:57.760]  Like, did Billy Ripken die? He did not, by the way.
[53:57.960 --> 54:00.920]  Like, did he get it? Did he get added to the Hall of Fame?
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.180]  Like, what's the deal? And they don't seem to know why.
[54:03.180 --> 54:05.240]  And I think we can take credit for that.
[54:05.540 --> 54:06.500]  I mean, that might be true.
[54:06.800 --> 54:10.260]  I don't know. I mean, who else is pushing Billy Ripken's face card right now?
[54:11.080 --> 54:12.060]  That's a great point.
[54:12.520 --> 54:15.280]  Is that the most valuable card you have now, you think?
[54:15.820 --> 54:16.320]  Who, me?
[54:16.860 --> 54:17.180]  Yeah.
[54:17.580 --> 54:18.880]  No, no, no, no.
[54:18.880 --> 54:19.380]  You don't think so?
[54:19.520 --> 54:21.880]  Well, what about for for how much?
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.440]  I got that. Emily got me that box of that immaculate box.
[54:24.500 --> 54:25.620]  I had a lot of stuff in there. What's up?
[54:25.840 --> 54:28.840]  That's true. I'm just thinking of like, well, what do you think is your most valuable card?
[54:29.260 --> 54:32.840]  I have a Charles... I have an autographed Charles Barkley rookie card that I've had since...
[54:33.560 --> 54:38.100]  Well, that's how I got the Charles Barkley story from... that I've had since 16.
[54:38.940 --> 54:41.220]  He was less than excited to do it, right?
[54:41.280 --> 54:45.240]  Yeah. He was less than enthused. I don't know, man. I got a lot of like...
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.620]  I got a really cool Randy Orozarena, like, one of one the other day.
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.240]  I got some stuff. Right now, I'm collecting...
[54:53.240 --> 54:56.660]  I've decided I'm gonna own every Marcus Smart rookie card.
[54:56.700 --> 54:58.000]  He's my favorite player on the Celtics.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.060]  And so I... and now I'm flirting with the idea of instead of just having
[55:02.060 --> 55:05.120]  every Marcus Smart rookie card, like, because, you know, there's like...
[55:05.120 --> 55:09.960]  Andrew knows this, but there's like 60 versions of a rookie card in a year.
[55:10.140 --> 55:12.500]  Like, probably, literally, there's probably 60 different
[55:12.500 --> 55:15.060]  Marcus Smart rookie cards from 2015 or 2014.
[55:15.360 --> 55:17.640]  So I was thinking, I'll collect all of them.
[55:17.740 --> 55:20.320]  And then I was thinking, instead of collecting one of each,
[55:20.400 --> 55:23.160]  what if I just collect every Marcus Smart rookie card on Earth?
[55:23.720 --> 55:26.400]  So now I'm buying... because they're not super expensive,
[55:26.400 --> 55:30.900]  I'm buying, like, lots of, like, 20 of his Donruss rookie card at a time,
[55:31.020 --> 55:32.020]  because it's, like, eight bucks.
[55:32.220 --> 55:34.220]  And I get, like... and now... and I'm getting...
[55:34.220 --> 55:36.020]  like, this is where it's... what I'm saying, it's getting dark.
[55:36.080 --> 55:39.320]  This is getting really dark. I'm getting way too... way too into it.
[55:39.500 --> 55:42.320]  But I think that we have manipulated, unintentionally,
[55:42.360 --> 55:45.800]  but I think that we have helped increase the value of the Billy Ripken card
[55:47.180 --> 55:49.200]  because it's going for, like, a couple hundred bucks on eBay,
[55:49.340 --> 55:52.080]  whereas before our podcast, it was going for, like, 20, 30 bucks.
[55:52.620 --> 55:53.480]  You don't need to do.
[55:53.920 --> 55:54.480]  I didn't get one.
[55:54.960 --> 55:56.600]  No, that's your problem, Gavin.
[55:57.060 --> 55:59.080]  I'm going to continue this. You can get in on this.
[55:59.640 --> 56:02.000]  There's a very clear thing we need to do now.
[56:02.900 --> 56:06.040]  What is the cheapest, most bullshit card we can find
[56:06.040 --> 56:07.560]  and then buy a bunch of?
[56:07.980 --> 56:10.400]  Raise the value on that. Media profit.
[56:10.760 --> 56:12.920]  I'm kind of trying to do that with Marcus Smart cards right now.
[56:13.740 --> 56:17.140]  I don't think... I don't know about the Marcus Smart market.
[56:17.300 --> 56:19.740]  I think we need to pick... because Marcus Smart has value.
[56:19.980 --> 56:21.680]  He's a loved player. He's popular.
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.440]  I think we need to find someone who has no value at all.
[56:25.620 --> 56:28.920]  No disrespect to them. No value at all. Terrible player.
[56:29.700 --> 56:30.080]  Just fill that market.
[56:30.080 --> 56:32.660]  Is it legal to do this kind of artificial inflation?
[56:32.800 --> 56:34.160]  It's almost like inside a trading.
[56:34.760 --> 56:37.300]  Who's going to stop us? Fucking the Panini company?
[56:37.540 --> 56:39.920]  What are they going to do? I'm not worried about Panini.
[56:40.180 --> 56:42.440]  Don't think of it as... think of it as a social experiment.
[56:42.560 --> 56:44.360]  Don't think of it as a money-making venture, Gavin.
[56:44.400 --> 56:44.620]  Yeah.
[56:44.740 --> 56:46.660]  Think of it as, like, you know how everything is terrible?
[56:46.880 --> 56:49.900]  Do you know those dudes, the people that they collect the Jerry Maguire VHS tapes?
[56:50.320 --> 56:51.460]  And they're building, like, a...
[56:51.460 --> 56:55.860]  a shrine in the desert with, like, hundreds of thousands of Jerry Maguire VHS tapes?
[56:56.080 --> 56:57.640]  Think of it like that. It's like performance art.
[56:57.740 --> 57:04.160]  We're collecting every 1991 Detlef Schrempf fucking Topps card, or whatever it is.
[57:04.900 --> 57:07.300]  We just need to figure out... and I bet the audience could help us.
[57:07.500 --> 57:11.600]  Who's the best character to pick to do this with?
[57:11.620 --> 57:15.040]  Just a useless... why do they even have a card player?
[57:15.120 --> 57:17.840]  I feel like Andrew was going for money, though.
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.440]  Oh, I definitely was. But, I mean, I'm open to performance art, too.
[57:21.440 --> 57:28.160]  But for the purposes of us saying it in public on this podcast, he's not.
[57:28.780 --> 57:29.280]  No, exactly.
[57:30.220 --> 57:30.660]  Bad play.
[57:30.940 --> 57:31.220]  It's art.
[57:32.580 --> 57:35.000]  Yeah, we just need to figure out, like, who's the... who's the, like...
[57:36.980 --> 57:40.260]  who's the Matt Bragg of professional sports?
[57:42.080 --> 57:43.580]  Think about it.
[57:48.150 --> 57:48.870]  Poor Matt.
[57:49.230 --> 57:52.850]  Yeah, that wasn't necessary. That was a blow-off, Geoff. That was just mean.
[57:52.850 --> 57:56.130]  Only because I love him so much, and he'll never know because he doesn't listen.
[57:56.830 --> 57:58.250]  I think they'll know about that one.
[57:58.510 --> 58:00.410]  Yeah, that was unnecessary.
[58:01.470 --> 58:04.630]  Do you have any collectibles, Gavin? Do you collect any shit?
[58:08.010 --> 58:13.330]  I think collectibles... do you remember when Hurricane Katrina happened and Bungie sold...
[58:15.830 --> 58:19.290]  I'm sorry, I just didn't expect... I didn't expect Hurricane Katrina
[58:19.290 --> 58:21.990]  to come out of the collectible talk. Go ahead, I apologize.
[58:21.990 --> 58:28.950]  And they sold a shirt. I think all the proceeds went to some Katrina charity or, like, money pool.
[58:29.610 --> 58:34.090]  So they had this diagram of Master Chief kicking the flood, and it said,
[58:34.290 --> 58:38.390]  Fight the Flood on a shirt. They sold that shirt to make money. Anyway,
[58:38.490 --> 58:43.710]  I've got the original sketch of that, which I bought at the charity auction at the end.
[58:44.370 --> 58:47.570]  That's probably the only thing that's, I would say, collectible that someone who
[58:47.570 --> 58:48.850]  likes Halo might actually want.
[58:48.850 --> 58:52.310]  You get a certain piece of art from a certain artist that's pretty fucking cool.
[58:52.470 --> 58:55.270]  One of a kind. What are you referring to? Damien Hirst?
[58:55.530 --> 58:57.870]  Yeah. Yeah, Damien Hirst signed, uh,
[58:58.390 --> 59:01.650]  some, like, a coverall that I was wearing. That's pretty cool.
[59:01.750 --> 59:04.390]  Not really a collectible. It's not really, like, a well-known item, though.
[59:04.810 --> 59:06.350]  Yeah. It's just, he doodled on me.
[59:07.130 --> 59:09.110]  I think a Damien Hirst doodle is pretty collectible.
[59:11.330 --> 59:13.470]  Those are cool options. Yeah.
[59:13.590 --> 59:17.630]  I just, like, it's... I feel like I need... I just have dumb stuff.
[59:17.630 --> 59:22.090]  Like, that's the best collectible items I have are just items nobody needs.
[59:22.730 --> 59:26.810]  Like, I think my Forest Whitaker autographed Battlefield Earth card,
[59:26.930 --> 59:29.610]  probably the best collectible I have. Nobody needs that.
[59:29.810 --> 59:32.130]  That's not a thing anyone wants. I'm jealous of it.
[59:32.550 --> 59:34.910]  It's a really stupid... It was a rare pull.
[59:35.150 --> 59:38.930]  I think this is probably the greatest pull I'll ever have in my life from a box.
[59:39.290 --> 59:41.410]  And it's for a card nobody actually cares about.
[59:41.470 --> 59:44.190]  Should it... Should we do this once or should we do this...
[59:44.850 --> 59:47.950]  Oh, like, because, you know, I'm sitting here trying to think of who's, like,
[59:47.970 --> 59:54.730]  the goofiest athlete or, like, the worst baseball card you can think of to pick.
[59:55.050 --> 59:57.790]  But, like, you bring up... You bring up that, like, should...
[59:57.790 --> 01:00:02.490]  Like, we could... We could pick a Daredevil the movie card, too.
[01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.130]  Or it could be, like, a Garbage Pail Kid.
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:05.510]  It doesn't have to be sports.
[01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:06.630]  That's true.
[01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:07.050]  Yeah.
[01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:08.130]  Entertainment cards.
[01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:08.870]  I don't know.
[01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:10.930]  Although I do think sports probably makes more sense.
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.790]  I think so, too. There's...
[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.610]  There's a hockey player.
[01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.230]  I don't know. I should look if Dale Weiss has cards.
[01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:18.930]  Okay.
[01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.850]  I like Dale Weiss.
[01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:23.090]  Dale Weiss is this hockey player who's, like, a fourth-line guy,
[01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.890]  meaning that he's, like, he's a professional athlete,
[01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:31.310]  but he's as barely a professional athlete as you can be within the sport of hockey.
[01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:37.110]  And there was a lockout a few years ago, and almost every player went to either,
[01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.430]  like, the Swedish Elite League or the Russian, like, the KHL, like, the main Russian league.
[01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:46.730]  And Dale Weiss went to, like, this Dutch league that no other player went to
[01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.810]  that is, like, barely above amateur.
[01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:54.050]  And he scored, like, 50 goals and had, like, 60 assists in 20 games.
[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.730]  And so then he came back after the lockout, and everybody was calling him Dutch Gretzky,
[01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:00.070]  which I thought it was because he was...
[01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:02.870]  He lit it up over there like nobody has ever seen.
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:07.090]  It was like he was the LeBron James for, like, two weeks and then came back to reality.
[01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:09.210]  So Dale Weiss, I'm going to put in the ring.
[01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.830]  All right.
[01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:12.350]  A card that I can't imagine has any value.
[01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.150]  I don't think anyone's collecting Dale Weiss cards.
[01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:16.730]  We'll put him in the ring, and I'm going to think of...
[01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:17.470]  I'm going to think of people.
[01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:18.650]  Yeah.
[01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:21.430]  OK, I'm on it.
[01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.010]  I'm going to come up with some options, too.
[01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.410]  I'm fascinated to hear what Gavin will come up with.
[01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:27.390]  Yeah, me too.
[01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:28.410]  It's what I'm interested in.
[01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.130]  Somebody who doesn't know anything about this.
[01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:30.930]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:35.050]  I tried to get Ernie Johnson to intro this podcast once.
[01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.410]  I should mention that.
[01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:36.550]  No, you didn't.
[01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:37.210]  I can't.
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.150]  Did you really?
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.210]  I did.
[01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.790]  Yeah, it didn't go anywhere, but I tried.
[01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:43.830]  Gavin, you don't know who that is, but he's a basketball dancer.
[01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.010]  That's fucking cool.
[01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.650]  One of the best.
[01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.170]  Yeah, his DMs are open on Twitter for some reason.
[01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.670]  I thought that was crazy.
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.370]  So I was just like, hey, Ernie, what's up?
[01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.410]  Sliding into Ernie's DMs.
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:58.090]  I slid so hard into Ernie's DMs to try to get him.
[01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:59.270]  It was when we're doing...
[01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.610]  I don't...
[01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:01.330]  Did we even do an intro to this episode?
[01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:02.130]  I don't think we did.
[01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:03.390]  Hey, hello and welcome.
[01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.230]  Yeah, we did because it's episode 35 or 38.
[01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.970]  Oh, that's right.
[01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:07.290]  Yeah.
[01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:08.150]  No, I guess we did.
[01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.410]  He seems really professional,
[01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.230]  so I thought he'd be able to give us a good intro.
[01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:12.790]  So I tried.
[01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:13.930]  It reached out, nothing happened.
[01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.190]  Well, hopefully the audience will have some suggestions for us too.
[01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:21.890]  The collective brainpower of the Christmas...
[01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.130]  If they can make a Christmas album,
[01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:25.710]  they can come up with a funny card for us to collect, for sure.
[01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:28.710]  Valentine's Day album on the way, from what I hear.
[01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.670]  Are you serious?
[01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:30.550]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:31.650]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:34.470]  It's rare that not many people make Valentine's Day albums,
[01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:35.270]  but it's in the works.
[01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.450]  Also, if anyone in the audience has tips on drain mushrooms,
[01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.130]  whether I should do it or whether I should move, let me know.
[01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:42.650]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:46.770]  And if you have a line on bat knob manufacturers, let us know.
[01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.650]  Oh, fuck, Geoff.
[01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:49.350]  I've been meaning...
[01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.630]  Thank you for saying that.
[01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:53.330]  I even queued this up to load.
[01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.310]  I'm going to post a photo in the Discord.
[01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.030]  I have a knob guy.
[01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.810]  And when I was talking to him about knobs, as one does,
[01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.110]  he showed me this photo and was like, which one do you want?
[01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:08.510]  I feel like, as much as I hate to say it, Gavin might have a point,
[01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:12.010]  because those are definite Gavin understandings of what a knob is.
[01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:14.390]  Well, the one on the right looks like a butt plug.
[01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:16.810]  I'd say the middle one is the best knob.
[01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:20.410]  That could be a cabinet handle, and you could write something on it.
[01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:23.850]  I think the one on the left is like, that's what a knob is to me.
[01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.490]  That's what a knob is to me.
[01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:29.030]  On the left, that could be anything.
[01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.510]  That could be the back of a pin.
[01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:36.190]  What? Like a badge.
[01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.010]  Yeah, but yours could be a fucking doorknob, as you said.
[01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.490]  Like, I don't know.
[01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:43.990]  Yeah, but that's you got to have a little bit of stick to make it a knob.
[01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.130]  A knob on its own.
[01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.930]  I think, think of it this way, Gavin.
[01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.950]  We could flip that that knob coin.
[01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:51.230]  It's like a knob coin.
[01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:52.470]  Just the knob.
[01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:55.570]  You could flip that and it might land the same way.
[01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.350]  Then if we want to be flipping stuff, the whole point was a knob.
[01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:00.050]  It is a knob.
[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:00.590]  What do you mean?
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.830]  That is all a knob.
[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.490]  What you're arguing for is beyond the knob.
[01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:05.150]  It's not a knob.
[01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:10.170]  A knob needs some shaft as a context to qualify its knobness.
[01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:11.330]  That's not true.
[01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.070]  That's absolutely not.
[01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:14.590]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.850]  A knob is a knob.
[01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.970]  What do you mean?
[01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:17.530]  What do you mean?
[01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:18.830]  Look, if I give you...
[01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:19.590]  A knob is a knob, man.
[01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:25.090]  It's like saying a wheel needs part of an axle to still be a wheel.
[01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:27.110]  But you couldn't open a door.
[01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.890]  You couldn't twist a door open with what you've got on the left.
[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:31.830]  If you hammered it into a fucking thing, you could.
[01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:33.070]  What thing?
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.210]  Well, you couldn't hit a baseball with any of those.
[01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:38.430]  Well, they're not bats, they're knobs.
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.630]  Well, the one on the right is half a bat.
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.590]  It's like a tenth of a bat.
[01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:44.670]  Okay, look.
[01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:47.530]  By definition, what's a knob?
[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:49.130]  Does anyone know?
[01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:50.090]  Something you can grip.
[01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:50.890]  It feels like an Eric thing.
[01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.390]  Hold on.
[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.390]  You can definitely grip that knob.
[01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:55.190]  With...
[01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:56.250]  Hold on.
[01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:57.730]  I'm looking up that knob definition.
[01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:03.590]  A rounded lump or ball, especially at the end or on the surface of something.
[01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:04.530]  Oh!
[01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.230]  I think I just won.
[01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:08.450]  No, because you could remove it from the thing.
[01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:09.210]  It would still be a knob.
[01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:12.330]  Okay, if that's not a fucking knob on the left, what is it, Gavin?
[01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.510]  Um, a circle of wood?
[01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:17.610]  Like a completely useless, coin-shaped piece of wood?
[01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.070]  What do you mean?
[01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:19.790]  What would you call that?
[01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.550]  It's just not a thing now?
[01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:22.530]  That doesn't exist.
[01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:23.310]  That's not a thing.
[01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:25.310]  The one in the middle is an actual knob.
[01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:26.710]  No, it's not.
[01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.010]  Well, they're all knobs.
[01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:31.930]  Technically, they all have a knob, but I think there's an unnecessary amount of...
[01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:32.170]  Ah, shit.
[01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:33.730]  Eric, what are these?
[01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:34.710]  Which one's the knob?
[01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:36.930]  Yeah, maybe we'll have to let Eric decide.
[01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:41.230]  Uh, I think we should let the fans decide, but I think it's the middle one,
[01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:42.990]  because the one on the left looks like a coin.
[01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.310]  Yes!
[01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.970]  And I understand where everyone's coming from,
[01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:50.830]  but I think if you were to show people on the left the, like, or people,
[01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.830]  the one on the left, I think they would look at it and go,
[01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:54.550]  well, that's a button.
[01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.690]  And then the middle one looks like a knob.
[01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:58.290]  I'm sorry, but that's how...
[01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:01.470]  I don't think anyone would say the middle one is a knob either, though.
[01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.570]  Without context, that just looks like a bottom part of a bat.
[01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:06.310]  Yeah, right, right, right.
[01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:08.210]  The bottom part of a bat, which is known as...
[01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:10.110]  Yeah, but it's about how we phrase it again.
[01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:11.570]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:14.270]  We need to post a poll, A, B, or C.
[01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.870]  Yes, I agree.
[01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:15.790]  Which one is the knob?
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:16.910]  I'm okay with that.
[01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:18.290]  C is ludicrous.
[01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.730]  If we're gonna make C, we might as well say it's a fucking hat.
[01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:22.330]  C is ludicrous.
[01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.350]  A or B, please.
[01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:26.110]  We'll put the picture up.
[01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:27.790]  We'll put a big red fucking cross in C.
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.390]  Fuck C.
[01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:29.670]  It's gotta be A or B.
[01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.170]  Okay, I think that's good.
[01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:32.230]  Okay.
[01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:33.930]  All right, we'll let the audience decide.
[01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:37.830]  Andrew, can this person, can this knob person crank out knobs?
[01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:41.930]  I said, well, I believe so.
[01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:44.330]  I asked, how many knobs could you make me?
[01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:45.470]  And they said, as many as you need.
[01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:51.910]  Okay, well, let's put them in touch with Tony in merch, or Robert in merch.
[01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:56.930]  And let's get, well, first off, we gotta get, well, let's get, make the introduction
[01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.710]  so that they know each other, and then we'll figure out what the cost is and stuff.
[01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.890]  Why are you, what are you doing?
[01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:02.370]  What are you, what is this?
[01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:03.890]  We're gonna shell knobs!
[01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:08.330]  Yeah, I don't know why you're doing the business end of it right now with teaching Andrew how to do it.
[01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:09.690]  Oh, it's a peer behind the veil!
[01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.490]  The audience loves to see that.
[01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:11.910]  Oh, fuck.
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.230]  They're way into it.
[01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:14.810]  But Andrew, it's the secret sauce.
[01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:19.790]  Are these the knobs of a full-size bat, or tiny bat knobs again?
[01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.510]  I, uh, I don't, I don't know how bats work.
[01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:26.670]  If we're gonna sell bat knobs, they need to be full-size knobs.
[01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.250]  I, uh...
[01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.570]  I agree.
[01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:32.730]  There's no point in, there's no point in selling what we just,
[01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:35.790]  like, the bat that we sold in knob-only form.
[01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.830]  I want to see, I want to see these, like, a nice finished kitchen,
[01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.470]  you know, all looking really nice, but one of the cabinets has our bat knob on it.
[01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:45.090]  Yeah.
[01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.950]  That's the dream for me.
[01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:47.490]  Yeah.
[01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:48.150]  That's the dream?
[01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:49.230]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:52.450]  I think those are normal-size knobs, are they not?
[01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:54.430]  I don't, I don't, I haven't got the bat...
[01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.230]  There's no scale there.
[01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.870]  Yeah, but I, I think...
[01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:58.190]  That's a, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:07:58.270 --> 01:07:59.410]  It is a, there is some scale.
[01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:00.610]  Oh, it's a pool table.
[01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:01.410]  That's a pool table.
[01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:02.910]  So...
[01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:07.270]  There's still no scale, it's not right by the pocket.
[01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.190]  No, it's not.
[01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:11.690]  No, you could kind of, I feel like you could kind of figure that out.
[01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:14.290]  I'd say that's, uh, it's like the size of a pool ball.
[01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:17.670]  The middle one's probably about the size of a pool ball, right?
[01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:18.470]  No.
[01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:23.310]  I think the knob, it would, I think you could put a pool ball on that, just the knob.
[01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:24.830]  I think it would sit on there fine.
[01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.550]  I really like the middle one, guys.
[01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:27.990]  I really like the way that looks.
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.950]  I...
[01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:32.330]  I'm with Andrew, but, you know, here we are.
[01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:33.010]  It looks like the reverse cork to me.
[01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:34.650]  I think we got to let the audience decide.
[01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:36.790]  Do they want a little bit of, do they want a little bit of stick in there?
[01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:38.330]  Do they want a little bit of knob in, or...
[01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:38.530]  Yeah.
[01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:39.770]  I can't talk.
[01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:41.790]  Which one is the knob, A, B, or C?
[01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.350]  Not C, fuck C. A, A or B.
[01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:45.630]  Which one do you want, A or B?
[01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:46.090]  It's in the picture.
[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:47.670]  Yeah, I'll put it in there.
[01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:49.630]  In, like, a year when this comes out.
[01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.690]  How far, when does this, when does this air?
[01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.070]  Two weeks from now.
[01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:54.070]  In, like, two weeks?
[01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.670]  We're not that far ahead.
[01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:55.470]  Okay, all right.
[01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.630]  Yeah.
[01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.450]  We will be so...
[01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:57.970]  We're not that far.
[01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.510]  Hey, man.
[01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:00.150]  Yeah, but we...
[01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:00.170]  We're that far behind.
[01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.410]  We're not that far ahead.
[01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:01.910]  Come on.
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:06.350]  The way our, the way we, our dumb shit works, we'll be so far past knobs by in two weeks,
[01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:07.510]  we'll be talking about some other dumb shit.
[01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:11.730]  We'll be trying to sell Gavin's magic mushrooms or whatever.
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.430]  Biohazard.
[01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:15.790]  Are we just doing one or two today?
[01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:16.610]  No, we're just doing one.
[01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:17.190]  I gotta, I gotta get here.
[01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:17.850]  Yeah, it's just one.
[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:19.010]  And we should end this one.
[01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.230]  Oh yeah, let's do that.
[01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.850]  Hey, thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:26.530]  I believe it was episode 35, but it also could have been episode 38.
[01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.790]  Either way, it was 35 is what I'm hearing, potentially.
[01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:32.270]  Probably not 38, probably 35.
[01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:33.610]  Like and subscribe.
[01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:34.770]  I don't know why I say that.
[01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:35.610]  This is not on YouTube.
[01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:43.530]  But hit, give us all the stars and leave us a review and be sure to let us know
[01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:48.950]  who, who you think we should own every basketball or baseball or sports card of.
[01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:49.730]  That's a great call.
[01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.430]  Also, I'm looking to sell, not the Rooster Teeth store.
[01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:53.450]  So interested, let me know.
[01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:54.150]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:57.910]  Also, bats are out of, out of, out of stock.
[01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:03.070]  The base, the hats are also the, the, the Russian f*** hats are out of stock.
[01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:05.430]  But we do still have Ian shirts.
[01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:06.370]  That is true.
[01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:09.750]  So if you wanted to pick up an Ian pocket tee, they're still available in the store.
[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:10.610]  Can I have a hat, Eric?
[01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.350]  Yes.
[01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.050]  And we have our own section now in the store.
[01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:16.430]  And I'd like to point out that the Ian tee has been in the store now for a while,
[01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.010]  and I still don't have one.
[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:19.850]  I don't have a GERPL shirt, Geoff.
[01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:20.850]  I don't either.
[01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:22.250]  Do we sell that yet?
[01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.730]  Yeah.
[01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:24.590]  Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.
[01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.370]  Oh my God, end the f***ing episode.
