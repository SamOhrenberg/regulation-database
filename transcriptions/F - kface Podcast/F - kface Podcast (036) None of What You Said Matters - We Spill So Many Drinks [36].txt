[00:30.980 --> 00:33.400]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:44.760 --> 00:47.740]  You have no fucking idea the problems, guy.
[00:47.760 --> 00:50.000]  You have no idea the problems I've been through today.
[00:50.100 --> 00:51.500]  They know because they showed up.
[00:51.660 --> 00:53.820]  I was here. What do you mean I didn't show up?
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.980]  You can't always say you're here on time when your shit's broken and mostly you're not here.
[00:59.180 --> 00:59.880]  It doesn't work.
[01:00.160 --> 01:01.460]  I don't understand what that means.
[01:01.800 --> 01:05.840]  You being here early is irrelevant if by the time three o'clock comes around,
[01:05.900 --> 01:08.520]  we can't press record and start because you're not there.
[01:08.520 --> 01:11.120]  Hit record, Gavin, so I don't know what you want from me.
[01:11.340 --> 01:13.940]  I'm recording. Have you hit record yet, Gavin?
[01:14.260 --> 01:15.060]  Because I'm recording.
[01:15.360 --> 01:21.520]  Can I just say, every time it's not me, I am so happy.
[01:21.640 --> 01:22.660]  How do I adjust this?
[01:23.700 --> 01:25.500]  How do I adjust my waveforms?
[01:25.940 --> 01:27.960]  My gain, right? I got to twist it up or down?
[01:28.240 --> 01:28.440]  Down.
[01:28.680 --> 01:29.340]  That... down.
[01:29.600 --> 01:31.760]  Down? Oh, I twisted it all the way up.
[01:32.220 --> 01:32.600]  I don't...
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.880]  The word is gain as well.
[01:35.020 --> 01:35.500]  It's like a...
[01:36.560 --> 01:37.560]  That's a great point.
[01:37.560 --> 01:39.000]  You know, that's a great point.
[01:39.060 --> 01:40.800]  I never considered the literal thing for gain.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.780]  Can I talk about the disaster?
[01:43.880 --> 01:45.180]  You're having a great time, Geoff.
[01:46.380 --> 01:47.690]  I have... I don't even...
[01:48.920 --> 01:51.760]  Okay, so I get my setup ready.
[01:52.420 --> 01:54.320]  Geoff hosts in the Discord.
[01:54.720 --> 01:57.040]  I have something I want to talk about before we start.
[01:57.220 --> 01:59.140]  I'm always here like 20 minutes early.
[01:59.500 --> 02:01.080]  So I was like, great, I can talk to Geoff.
[02:01.400 --> 02:02.560]  I'll have somebody to talk to.
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.140]  I put my thing in.
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.060]  I set everything up.
[02:05.360 --> 02:06.160]  Nothing's working.
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.540]  Can't figure out why.
[02:07.660 --> 02:10.740]  So I'm like, I don't know, maybe there's like a USB port issue.
[02:11.080 --> 02:13.880]  So I go to like adjust the USB port on my computer.
[02:14.300 --> 02:15.680]  I knock my computer over.
[02:15.900 --> 02:17.800]  It knocks my monitor over.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.480]  It knocks over my cup of water that is like a liter.
[02:22.020 --> 02:23.280]  Fire extinguisher goes flying.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.340]  Everything goes flying.
[02:25.600 --> 02:27.820]  I have a giant puddle on my floor.
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.420]  I have to clean everything up.
[02:29.560 --> 02:31.060]  I still don't know what the issue is.
[02:31.120 --> 02:32.580]  I go through all this shit.
[02:32.720 --> 02:35.940]  We're going back and forth for like 10 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong.
[02:35.940 --> 02:40.620]  The issue was I plugged my microphone into, I think, the second mic slot.
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.220]  I think that's what caused all this.
[02:43.140 --> 02:48.220]  So you created a comical Rube Goldberg machine in your room.
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.600]  Everything fell.
[02:49.720 --> 02:52.080]  My monitor is literally dripping right now.
[02:52.080 --> 02:53.440]  It got covered in water.
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.620]  Recording setups on the top of a house of cards.
[02:56.160 --> 02:56.620]  It is.
[02:56.720 --> 02:58.400]  Yeah, it was a fucking disaster.
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.720]  It might be, it might have something to do with the fact that you've crammed everything
[03:02.720 --> 03:05.260]  that's important to you in your life into your bedroom.
[03:05.260 --> 03:06.500]  Here's the...
[03:06.500 --> 03:09.900]  Okay, so just to pivot off of that, I've added a new thing.
[03:10.300 --> 03:11.200]  I made a mistake.
[03:11.720 --> 03:14.280]  I've always wanted to learn how to play piano.
[03:14.640 --> 03:15.720]  Good Christ.
[03:15.980 --> 03:18.580]  I bought an 88 key digital piano.
[03:19.060 --> 03:22.000]  Those things are way bigger than you would anticipate.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.620]  Those things are fucking huge.
[03:25.240 --> 03:25.920]  They're huge.
[03:26.420 --> 03:27.960]  It's five feet long.
[03:28.240 --> 03:31.300]  I'm imagining the width of 88 fingers.
[03:31.300 --> 03:35.200]  It is five feet long, or it's like just barely under five feet.
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.860]  I was not prepared for that.
[03:37.320 --> 03:38.480]  It has been an issue.
[03:39.780 --> 03:41.460]  I don't have room for it.
[03:41.540 --> 03:43.140]  So I just, I put it on my bed.
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.040]  Have you considered putting it maybe in another room?
[03:46.800 --> 03:49.980]  But what I'm imagining is a bunch of completely empty rooms.
[03:50.540 --> 03:50.820]  Yeah.
[03:51.320 --> 03:54.900]  I could imagine the kitchen full of shit, a bedroom full of shit,
[03:55.180 --> 03:57.660]  three other empty rooms is how I picture your living situation.
[03:59.460 --> 04:00.460]  That's a good point.
[04:00.460 --> 04:03.400]  I don't have a stand for it, and I'd have to move a chair in there.
[04:03.560 --> 04:05.020]  It's more work, too.
[04:05.440 --> 04:06.700]  I'd have to move a chair, Gavin.
[04:07.080 --> 04:08.300]  But now it's on your bed.
[04:08.320 --> 04:10.340]  You have to move it every time you want to sleep.
[04:10.380 --> 04:11.560]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.520]  I'm just sleeping with it.
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.400]  It's just on my bed.
[04:13.480 --> 04:14.660]  This is my life right now.
[04:15.260 --> 04:16.640]  Is it on the pillow?
[04:16.780 --> 04:19.580]  You're just sleeping next to it like I used to sleep next to a vacuum cleaner.
[04:20.320 --> 04:21.660]  Yeah, it's just, it's fine.
[04:22.060 --> 04:22.500]  It's five feet long.
[04:22.500 --> 04:23.280]  Oh my God.
[04:23.700 --> 04:25.400]  I'm imagining you rolling over and it just goes...
[04:30.060 --> 04:32.500]  It's a great, it's a great possible alarm clock.
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.500]  I've left it on just to see if that is ginormous.
[04:35.740 --> 04:38.580]  It's fucking huge and it's heavy.
[04:38.880 --> 04:40.540]  I thought it would be half the size.
[04:40.680 --> 04:41.920]  Oh my God.
[04:41.960 --> 04:46.440]  I'm honestly quite excited for you that you've you've seemed to have taken up
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.360]  what seems to be a normal hobby and not cooking in the closet.
[04:51.400 --> 04:52.280]  That's not a hobby.
[04:52.940 --> 04:53.820]  That's just fun.
[04:53.820 --> 04:55.440]  That's just pleasure for myself.
[04:55.600 --> 04:56.180]  This is a hobby.
[04:56.340 --> 04:57.160]  Isn't that what a hobby is?
[04:57.320 --> 04:58.080]  Like desk dogs?
[04:58.300 --> 04:59.080]  Is that not a hobby for you?
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.120]  No, I don't think desk dogs is a hobby.
[05:01.160 --> 05:01.860]  Keurig noodles?
[05:02.080 --> 05:02.620]  That's not a hobby?
[05:03.680 --> 05:03.960]  Okay.
[05:04.620 --> 05:07.680]  Hey, whatever happened, whatever happened with the, uh,
[05:07.720 --> 05:08.060]  what was it?
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.740]  Kool-Aid you were going to put through the Keurig?
[05:10.020 --> 05:12.020]  Oh, we'll do an intro first before we get into this.
[05:12.040 --> 05:12.540]  Oh yeah, sorry.
[05:13.160 --> 05:15.180]  Welcome to episode 36.
[05:15.780 --> 05:16.280]  Is that right?
[05:17.840 --> 05:19.080]  Yeah, I think that's right, actually.
[05:19.800 --> 05:20.120]  Wow.
[05:20.360 --> 05:21.400]  I think I just got it right.
[05:21.420 --> 05:21.840]  You did it.
[05:21.980 --> 05:23.360]  Holy shit, I got it right.
[05:24.460 --> 05:30.480]  Hello and welcome to episode 36 of F*** Face, a podcast about, uh,
[05:30.580 --> 05:31.820]  dipshits doing dipshit things.
[05:32.080 --> 05:32.940]  I am Geoff Ramsey.
[05:33.060 --> 05:36.660]  With me as always is British Gavin and Canadian Andrew, as we call them.
[05:37.440 --> 05:37.780]  Yes.
[05:38.180 --> 05:39.920]  And San Diego Eric.
[05:41.640 --> 05:42.860]  Wow, he didn't say hi.
[05:43.260 --> 05:44.080]  Yeah, he's rude.
[05:44.200 --> 05:44.740]  It's fine, he's rude.
[05:45.880 --> 05:49.920]  Anyway, so, man, first off, do you guys have a lot to talk about today?
[05:49.980 --> 05:52.480]  Because I am proud to admit that I don't.
[05:52.780 --> 05:53.060]  Oh.
[05:53.100 --> 05:53.680]  I have a lot.
[05:53.820 --> 05:55.040]  I have a lot.
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.380]  I would love to.
[05:56.440 --> 05:57.400]  I got one thing.
[05:57.900 --> 05:59.260]  Well, Andrew, you missed it.
[05:59.340 --> 05:59.660]  I'm sorry.
[05:59.800 --> 06:02.120]  And this is a dickhead move, I realize, for the audience.
[06:02.400 --> 06:05.920]  I had a story to tell that is not for the podcast.
[06:06.120 --> 06:09.000]  And I told Eric and Gavin before the podcast.
[06:09.120 --> 06:11.400]  And I'll have to sync up with you someday to tell you.
[06:12.000 --> 06:15.400]  It was an insane thing that happened to me today, but it is not funny.
[06:15.500 --> 06:16.400]  It is very sad.
[06:17.020 --> 06:20.640]  So, and it's not, I don't want to...
[06:21.100 --> 06:23.920]  It's just not, it's just a sad story that happened today.
[06:24.280 --> 06:25.520]  So why bring it up?
[06:26.020 --> 06:27.920]  Yeah, it sounds like it's really sad.
[06:28.420 --> 06:29.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:29.260 --> 06:30.700]  To be, like I said, it's a dickhead move.
[06:30.780 --> 06:31.960]  I was doing it to be a dick.
[06:32.220 --> 06:34.300]  Like, you know, sometimes you want to be a dick.
[06:35.100 --> 06:36.620]  Something insane happened to me today.
[06:36.820 --> 06:37.500]  Absolutely insane.
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.720]  And I'm not going to talk about it.
[06:41.380 --> 06:44.580]  I feel like you're just trying to generate interest in this story you have no plan on telling.
[06:45.180 --> 06:46.060]  I'll never tell it.
[06:46.460 --> 06:47.260]  I don't know, maybe I'll tell it.
[06:47.580 --> 06:47.900]  Okay.
[06:48.320 --> 06:49.460]  I think that's for you to decide.
[06:49.460 --> 06:50.860]  The ending is good.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.160]  Geoff was crying.
[06:52.720 --> 06:53.120]  I did cry.
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.300]  I cried for like 20 straight minutes.
[06:54.900 --> 06:56.620]  Like sad tears or like happy tears?
[06:56.800 --> 06:57.320]  Like funny tears?
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.000]  Both.
[06:58.800 --> 06:59.960]  Nothing funny about it.
[07:00.280 --> 07:01.820]  Sad tears, relieved tears.
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.200]  But yeah, it's uh...
[07:03.200 --> 07:03.480]  Okay.
[07:03.700 --> 07:05.660]  But I do, just real quick, and then I'll shut up.
[07:05.700 --> 07:07.100]  I won't talk for the rest of the podcast.
[07:07.360 --> 07:08.540]  No, why?
[07:09.360 --> 07:11.000]  I just have one thing.
[07:11.140 --> 07:12.700]  I just don't want to, I don't want to be a time burglar.
[07:12.800 --> 07:13.600]  I don't want to monopolize.
[07:13.760 --> 07:17.760]  But I do want to thank, on Twitter, a guy or a lady or a...
[07:18.720 --> 07:21.160]  they named Roadmaster 74.
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.660]  Roadmaster 74 tweeted to me.
[07:24.180 --> 07:28.240]  Roadmaster 74, I'm gonna say that name a lot, Roadmaster 74, because Roadmaster 4,
[07:28.700 --> 07:33.400]  they are the first human being, although their picture is of a fox,
[07:33.480 --> 07:35.260]  so maybe they're not a human, maybe they're a fox.
[07:35.800 --> 07:38.660]  They're the first entity, the sentient entity,
[07:39.020 --> 07:45.100]  that gave me salient, useful, simple, helpful, hit myself on the forehead,
[07:45.100 --> 07:47.060]  why didn't I think about that first?
[07:47.800 --> 07:50.820]  Advice and suggestion on how to fix my sock problem.
[07:51.060 --> 07:55.280]  So I want to say, Roadmaster 74, you're a fucking genius,
[07:55.360 --> 08:00.300]  because Roadmaster 74 said, hey, at Geoff L. Ramsey, about your sock situation,
[08:00.800 --> 08:03.040]  why not put them in the shoes already?
[08:03.460 --> 08:07.340]  That way, when you go to put your shoes on, the right sock is in the right shoe,
[08:07.460 --> 08:09.380]  and the left sock is in the left shoe.
[08:09.500 --> 08:12.240]  Just trying to help, love fuckface, love you, keep it up.
[08:12.240 --> 08:14.960]  It means you preload your shoes with your socks,
[08:15.060 --> 08:18.140]  so when I go the night before, like when I go to bed, I'll lay my socks,
[08:18.240 --> 08:20.820]  I just stick the left sock in the left shoe, and the right sock in the right shoe,
[08:21.020 --> 08:25.200]  then when I wake up in the morning, then I'll just grab my shoe, I'll just put it on.
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.520]  What do you mean, just preload them onto your feet, if anything, in the morning?
[08:29.060 --> 08:36.040]  You still have to look at your sock, and see if it's left or right, to preload the shoes.
[08:36.680 --> 08:38.520]  Just put them straight on your feet the next morning.
[08:39.360 --> 08:42.320]  God damn it, you're right, I still gotta look at them the night before.
[08:46.180 --> 08:49.080]  Here's why it may work, here's why it may work, here's why it may work, here's why it may work.
[08:49.220 --> 08:53.960]  Okay, it might work because, because, because, because, because, because the specific problem
[08:53.960 --> 09:01.560]  I have is I pick up my left sock from a right foot, but what if, what if I just pick up a sock,
[09:01.760 --> 09:05.400]  and I see what color it is, and then I just go put it in the, or color, sorry,
[09:05.600 --> 09:08.500]  I pick up a sock, and I see what letter it is, and then I just go put that letter
[09:08.500 --> 09:12.340]  in the appropriate shoe, and then it doesn't matter because I'm not applying it to my foot,
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.300]  my foot, my foot and my sock together is where it goes wrong, but if I just pick up a sock and
[09:16.300 --> 09:21.000]  look at it, ah, I don't know. It doesn't change a single thing, Geoff, that doesn't, all that does
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.240]  is move the problem to the night before. Think about, yes, Geoff, think about when we were actually
[09:27.240 --> 09:32.780]  trying to solve this. The issue that you talked about was that putting socks on is a mindless
[09:32.780 --> 09:38.320]  activity, and you're incapable of putting any thought into this process. All you've done is
[09:38.320 --> 09:42.700]  put thought into putting socks in the shoes. If you really want to sort the situation out,
[09:42.720 --> 09:47.300]  if you actually need a solution, put all your left socks in one drawer, and all your right
[09:47.300 --> 09:52.740]  socks in the other, and put them on your feet from those drawers every morning. Don't be
[09:52.740 --> 09:56.700]  farting around, bending over, putting socks in your shoes the night before. It's mental.
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.860]  Absolutely mental what you're saying. I think it's a feel thing. That's also good advice. I
[10:01.860 --> 10:07.060]  think that's the only true way to fix it. Gavin, I don't know where you were the last 2,000 times
[10:07.060 --> 10:11.360]  we talked about this, but that is decent advice. Well, I wasn't giving serious answers last time.
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.980]  I just gotta separate the drawers. It's not a real problem, Geoff. It is a real problem for me,
[10:16.040 --> 10:21.480]  and it's existed for fucking years. I wouldn't be talking about it every day of my fucking life if
[10:21.480 --> 10:32.500]  it wasn't a problem. Obviously, it's a problem. And thank you for the solution. I understand what
[10:32.500 --> 10:37.660]  you're saying about whatever this fucking kid's name was again. Now I forgot it. Roadmaster74.
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.940]  I get it. I'm just pre-loading the problem to provide a false sense of security 24 hours later
[10:43.940 --> 10:48.860]  or in the morning. I can wrap my head around that. But I also think that I'm mad at you, Gavin. I'm
[10:48.860 --> 10:54.420]  mad at you for saying it's not a problem when it's very clearly, very lucidly a problem. But also,
[10:54.480 --> 10:58.320]  I'm kind of happy with you because you gave me a decent idea with the drawers. Maybe I'll try that.
[10:58.760 --> 11:00.860]  Thanks. Andrew, what did you want to talk about?
[11:05.180 --> 11:06.380]  Are you all right, Andrew?
[11:07.020 --> 11:09.920]  Yeah. It's like none of what you said matters.
[11:11.440 --> 11:13.440]  It's even more insulting than what I said.
[11:13.900 --> 11:17.060]  No, it's like for solving the issue, it's a new thing.
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.680]  It's less than a problem. You should stop talking about it.
[11:23.060 --> 11:26.840]  No, no, no. I'm not saying you should stop talking about it. I'm saying all of your
[11:26.840 --> 11:30.920]  solutions that you're saying, like, that's a great idea, doesn't solve the issue because it's
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.100]  a new thing. You're going to have to fucking clean those socks. They're going to come out of the
[11:34.100 --> 11:38.040]  drawer. And then it's just going to be about how all your fucking right socks end up in the left
[11:38.040 --> 11:43.680]  drawer somehow. It's a new thing. You're just changing where the problem is. You're just
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.220]  moving the ball. You're not actually solving anything.
[11:46.600 --> 11:47.680]  How do I fix me?
[11:48.100 --> 11:51.580]  I think it's a feel thing. I've talked about that. I think you need to have something on the sock
[11:51.580 --> 11:55.060]  that's like a feel. You feel it and you're like, that's the left sock.
[11:55.120 --> 11:56.320]  Why don't you wake up backwards?
[11:56.840 --> 11:57.540]  You know what?
[12:00.400 --> 12:01.800]  That's the best idea of all.
[12:02.600 --> 12:05.560]  I've now talked about it too much. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
[12:06.180 --> 12:06.580]  Okay.
[12:07.260 --> 12:08.840]  I've just all worked up about it.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.720]  You had a useless suggestion there, Geoff, in the comments. I saw a useless comment
[12:13.940 --> 12:18.240]  where I was asking for like other things, like how Andrew didn't know that the mac
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.540]  in mac and cheese was macaroni. And like, what other obvious things does he not know?
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.260]  Someone in the comments, I can't remember what the name was, glanced it and laughed at it,
[12:26.260 --> 12:31.120]  said it took me ages to realize that can was short for canister.
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.640]  And I thought, I don't think that's true. I looked it up and I got what it just Googled
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.140]  is can short for canister. And you know how Google just like finds your answer and makes
[12:41.140 --> 12:45.600]  it big above all the results. It's quite an aggressive answer. Can, which date,
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.420]  which dates back to old English and canister, which didn't show up until at least the 16th
[12:50.420 --> 12:57.820]  century, are two separate words. Can is not and never has been a short form of canister.
[12:58.780 --> 13:04.680]  Really? Someone really like angrily typing about... Somebody's sick of hearing that.
[13:05.660 --> 13:14.220]  Fucking misnomer. And don't ask again. Stop it. It's not short for archive. It's the onion.
[13:15.300 --> 13:23.400]  Uh, should we get into at any point the fucking pod, the fucking Discord podcast that happened
[13:23.400 --> 13:29.340]  or Slack podcast that happened earlier this week? Oh, yeah. No, for sure. We're going to get two
[13:29.340 --> 13:35.500]  separate incidents that I, I was so confused to back into. And then it lasted. It was it
[13:35.500 --> 13:40.020]  got quite lengthy and aggressive. I think our biggest issue is that we record on the wrong day.
[13:40.020 --> 13:44.320]  Every Andrew seems to cause everything to happen on like a Monday or a Tuesday,
[13:44.500 --> 13:49.320]  and then we have to wait two days. I think maybe an even bigger issue is just that this
[13:49.320 --> 13:53.660]  fucking podcast is now happening 24 hours a day in our lives. It's just like the only way we know
[13:53.660 --> 13:58.120]  how to communicate with each other. You know, my biggest issue is the two knives in my back
[13:58.120 --> 14:05.020]  that Gavin shoved there. You say Gavin shoved two knives in your back? He backstabbed me twice.
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.960]  Right after Gavin and I had a conversation, I was like, man, it seems like you and I always just
[14:09.960 --> 14:14.740]  end up in an alliance, like you and I are together. It's strange, like even when it's not
[14:14.740 --> 14:20.000]  expected where we joined forces. Next week, he stabs me in the back. Three days later, he stabs
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.900]  me in the back again. Wait, what was the second knife? The second knife was the vote, how you
[14:24.900 --> 14:32.400]  described the vote. That was an absurd take on the vote. Look, I I'm sorry, but the judgment was
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.520]  ruled and it was ruled that it was fair and not insulting to you. And if anything, made you sound
[14:37.520 --> 14:44.080]  funny and cool. So between recordings, Andrew was complaining about this backstabbing and we ended
[14:44.080 --> 14:48.960]  up having another judgment. Geoff was the impartial judge. This all happened between this recording
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.740]  and the last one. Andrew, do you want to run us through what happened? Should we go in order?
[14:53.180 --> 14:56.600]  Let's go through the burgers first, because the burgers are brief. It's a brief thing. Sorry,
[14:56.620 --> 15:01.020]  I want to let this all go, but you're asking, should we do this in order? And you might as
[15:01.020 --> 15:07.320]  well just do it in whatever way you want, because I don't think the three of us understand how
[15:07.320 --> 15:14.660]  any of it happened or why it was just a thing that you started and did. So, okay, this is oh,
[15:15.100 --> 15:20.880]  no, no, no, no, no, no. Andrew goes any further. Can I ask a question then? I assumed that I was
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.880]  the only one lost in this whole thing and that Eric and Andrew and Gavin were all on the same
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.540]  page and I was playing catch up. Is that not the case? Are you guys confused too? Yeah, absolutely
[15:30.540 --> 15:36.040]  no idea what's going on. I don't understand what I don't know. I have no idea that. Thank you so
[15:36.040 --> 15:41.080]  much. Andrew, please. I can explain this, and this is, I know, funny. The audio is going to be
[15:41.080 --> 15:48.060]  on my side on this one. The previous episode, we talked about how I initiated the bet and then I had
[15:48.060 --> 15:53.980]  my sparring session. I ate a burger and I felt full that night, so I called it off. We had that talk.
[15:54.380 --> 15:59.700]  And in that conversation, I said, at least we have a framework done. And you agreed with me, Geoff,
[15:59.780 --> 16:05.200]  that when I do this again, I'm going to need to feel super confident about it and I won't have
[16:05.200 --> 16:10.780]  to ask anybody at least, because we've already agreed to the terms. I can just start. That's
[16:10.780 --> 16:16.340]  what happened. On Friday, I felt very confident, so I said to Eric, I need to let you know,
[16:16.520 --> 16:21.980]  because I figured if I failed, I would reveal on the show that I did it and I failed. And if it
[16:21.980 --> 16:26.160]  actually started to go well, I'd reveal after the first set because I changed my strategy.
[16:26.580 --> 16:31.000]  So that's all that happened. We agreed that I could just start this thing whenever I wanted
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.700]  to. That is not a crazy thing that I came out of left field. Do we remember this?
[16:36.600 --> 16:42.140]  No. Yes. I do. Andrew, I do remember. It was, I think, the last time we recorded,
[16:42.420 --> 16:46.440]  honestly. It was. I mean, I remember you saying that when you were feeling confident,
[16:46.480 --> 16:49.860]  I didn't I guess I didn't realize you were just going to go without saying.
[16:50.020 --> 16:55.920]  I guess I did it to back up Gavin a bit there. I guess I didn't either. But based on your
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.560]  retelling and now my recollection, I think I just might have missed that. But I think that you
[17:00.560 --> 17:06.040]  I think you were clear with it. I just didn't pick up on it. Same. Absolutely. And that's fine.
[17:06.160 --> 17:10.820]  That's why that's that's not that's not the betrayal part. I understand that. What happened
[17:10.820 --> 17:16.700]  was so my new strategy this time around was I'm going to order the burgers and waves because I
[17:16.700 --> 17:21.440]  feel like if I can beat it and like wave after wave like a boss, you do it in horde mode. Yeah,
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.640]  I'm doing a horde mode. I think if I mentally am like I'm cleared half the waves, I only got half
[17:26.640 --> 17:31.920]  the go. I can go the extra mile. But this is where things go wrong between like Left 4 Dead.
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.720]  It's like, oh, here they come. And all the burgers show up again. Every fifth burger's
[17:36.720 --> 17:43.700]  a boss burger. It's a double. Yeah, exactly. So I ordered 10 burgers. But this is the problem.
[17:43.800 --> 17:48.120]  I was so excited. I was so pumped up about it on Friday. I ordered the wrong burger.
[17:48.560 --> 17:53.500]  Every time we've done this, I've ordered the basic McDonald's hamburger and then the double
[17:53.500 --> 17:59.700]  hamburger. I accidentally ordered 10 McDouble's, which means they all have cheese on them. That's
[17:59.700 --> 18:06.400]  a lot of cheese to go the rest of the way with. So I paused the timer and I wanted Gavin's ruling.
[18:06.540 --> 18:11.740]  I wasn't even trying to argue with you. I felt that since I am doing a harder burger and I've
[18:11.740 --> 18:16.360]  already committed to this, I've ordered 10 of them. If I go the rest of the way and finish
[18:16.360 --> 18:21.360]  all these McDouble's with cheese on them, then I win the bet, even though it's not the regulation
[18:21.360 --> 18:28.120]  burger we agreed upon. But if I lose, it doesn't count because I was doing a harder burger. I was
[18:28.120 --> 18:33.800]  looking for a ruling for that. Gavin said, what's going on? I explained the situation. Never replied.
[18:34.200 --> 18:38.220]  Never made any comment about it. Still hasn't given a ruling. I think I was in the middle of
[18:38.220 --> 18:44.720]  a recording. I just got an alert saying we have a potential burger controversy. Clock is paused.
[18:44.720 --> 18:53.200]  25 minutes in. We need a judgment. Well, here is my fear. Just one quick addition.
[18:53.600 --> 18:58.660]  My fear was that I would eat all the doubles, right? Or I'd eat 10 of them and then you'd say
[18:58.660 --> 19:02.600]  doesn't count because those aren't the burgers we agreed upon. So I just wanted clarity was the
[19:02.600 --> 19:06.500]  main thing I was looking for. Go ahead, Jack. Okay, I just wanted to say real fast and I apologize for
[19:06.500 --> 19:11.800]  this. I just wanted to ask if Eric and Gavin have been listening to the last two minutes and
[19:11.800 --> 19:17.000]  everything Andrew said kind of made sense and you're aligned with it because I had an unfortunate
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.440]  in the middle of his story. I knocked my diet Dr. Pepper over on my keyboard and I had to run and
[19:23.440 --> 19:28.100]  get a towel and clean everything up. So I may have missed some of it. But if you guys were on board,
[19:28.260 --> 19:32.300]  then I'll just back you. I'll just be on board with that episode. I the only part that I would
[19:32.300 --> 19:40.680]  refute of Andrew's telling of that so far is that he was looking for a ruling from Gavin because
[19:40.680 --> 19:47.180]  then when I tagged Gavin, I got a message from Andrew that said that he considered that a
[19:47.180 --> 19:53.560]  betrayal. It was a definite betrayal. How many betrayals are involved? Is that a third knife
[19:53.560 --> 19:58.880]  in your back then? That is that. Yeah, but Eric was doing the right thing. So did you win the bet?
[19:59.320 --> 20:04.180]  No, I never got a ruling. So I stopped eating the burgers before. Just one quick detail to add.
[20:04.320 --> 20:08.840]  Well, I mean, give us some notice. I'm busy. I can't even get a chance to really read everything
[20:08.840 --> 20:14.540]  until like four hours after all this conversation. You've had over a fucking week to make a ruling.
[20:14.740 --> 20:18.860]  First of all, you still you haven't weighed in just generally on how you felt. Wait, how does
[20:18.860 --> 20:23.040]  it still apply now, though? I thought I just curious what your answer. No, there's no window.
[20:23.320 --> 20:29.600]  Are you trying to get me to rule over it's the one burger because you got cheese in him?
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.680]  No. OK, once again, I feel like my question is very simple. I ordered the wrong burger.
[20:34.680 --> 20:39.020]  It's a tougher burger. If I pursued with the tougher burger,
[20:39.220 --> 20:43.140]  would you count that as a win? And if I failed, would you count that as a loss?
[20:43.720 --> 20:48.220]  But I didn't specify the original burger, Andrew. But we always come from you.
[20:48.680 --> 20:52.460]  No, we've always used the base hamburger. That's the regulation burger.
[20:52.600 --> 20:56.160]  But why were you doing doubles last time? You did 25 doubles.
[20:56.420 --> 21:00.700]  When I did the doubles, I did the double hamburger. I accidentally ordered the McDouble.
[21:00.700 --> 21:03.320]  There's a difference between the double hamburger and the McDouble.
[21:03.320 --> 21:09.160]  The difference between 50 hamburgers and 25 double hamburgers is a bigger difference than
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.920]  25 double hamburgers and 25 McDoubles. The structure is different.
[21:15.240 --> 21:17.240]  It's just what I was saying. I was just looking for clarity.
[21:17.620 --> 21:23.040]  What it sounded like to me was like you have erroneously ordered these other burgers, which
[21:23.040 --> 21:29.720]  to me is still the same amount of burgers. And you've also said I'm willing to go through with
[21:29.720 --> 21:34.560]  it. If I win, I still win. But if I lose, I don't lose.
[21:35.340 --> 21:39.660]  I viewed it as like when you beat the game on hard and you get the achievements for normal and easy.
[21:40.020 --> 21:45.320]  But if you don't beat the game, you lose. Like it's still double or nothing,
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.560]  but you decided it wouldn't be nothing. Well, because I'm going with a tougher
[21:49.560 --> 21:54.140]  burger. So I was just curious. But you're only going with a tougher burger
[21:54.140 --> 21:58.260]  because of your inability to follow through with the bet properly.
[21:58.740 --> 22:04.260]  I accidentally ordered the wrong burgers. But you also already said you're ordering in waves.
[22:04.780 --> 22:08.040]  So surely the rest of the burgers would be normal and you could just do that.
[22:08.340 --> 22:09.580]  I know. Oh yeah.
[22:11.240 --> 22:14.680]  Am I understanding this? Were you trying to take 50 burgers
[22:14.680 --> 22:18.260]  and turn them into 25 McDoubles or would it be 50 McDoubles?
[22:19.140 --> 22:21.600]  No, it'd be 25. Because we're still...
[22:21.600 --> 22:25.400]  I think, Geoff, he's iterating off the second bet, which was 25
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.000]  25 double patty burgers. Oh, so we're at 25. Okay.
[22:32.580 --> 22:37.140]  What I was saying, Geoff, is what I was scared about is because I technically it's the wrong
[22:37.140 --> 22:41.960]  burger. It's not the regulation burger. So I didn't want to eat 10 of those and then find
[22:41.960 --> 22:44.760]  out that those didn't actually count. But from my point of view, Andrew,
[22:44.820 --> 22:48.540]  I'm there. I'm doing, you know, I'm doing some work and suddenly my phone's going off.
[22:48.760 --> 22:52.140]  The clock is stopped. The clock is stopped. We need to rule it now.
[22:52.140 --> 22:59.000]  No, no, it's totally fine. Honestly, as Eric said, I was feeling pretty full after the first three.
[22:59.260 --> 23:03.900]  So I'm like, I don't mind that Gavin's taking time. The problem is when it's burgers,
[23:04.040 --> 23:10.660]  if you extend over multiple days, Gavin, that was the issue, that there was no ruling over days.
[23:11.020 --> 23:15.820]  I didn't really fully understand what I was ruling over, honestly. And then you refused
[23:15.820 --> 23:19.480]  to give me a nice summary and we ended up just bickering for about three days.
[23:19.480 --> 23:23.580]  I gave you multiple summaries. Andrew said that he wanted the clock
[23:23.580 --> 23:29.220]  stopped because, quote, this is like when a fighter gets kicked in the balls in the UFC,
[23:29.500 --> 23:33.420]  but I kicked myself in the balls and I'm taking all the time I can.
[23:33.720 --> 23:38.860]  So he also said, quote, I view those pings as a personal betrayal.
[23:39.920 --> 23:46.400]  So if somebody gets hit in the balls in the UFC, do they just hide in a room and nobody can look
[23:46.400 --> 23:52.500]  at them or check on them or what's going on? No, no, this is no. Once again, like I'm not
[23:52.500 --> 23:56.380]  saying I'm saying I was trying to take advantage of that clock. I was more joking when I said it
[23:56.380 --> 24:01.920]  was a betrayal. I figured Gavin would be busy and you pinging him that definitely made him be aware
[24:01.920 --> 24:06.280]  that something was happening. I was OK with it to him taking hours because I viewed that as
[24:06.280 --> 24:11.520]  digestion time that I could hide behind. But he just never answered. So it was unfortunate.
[24:13.500 --> 24:18.940]  Also before just a quick addition to that, before I even started, the first thing I did was filled
[24:18.940 --> 24:24.040]  the cup that I knocked over today. I filled it with water, put on my desk, knocked it over
[24:24.040 --> 24:29.180]  immediately, fell all over my keyboard, all over the floor. I have spilt that one liter cup of
[24:29.180 --> 24:37.060]  water all over my desk while it's full three times in the past week. Three times.
[24:37.720 --> 24:44.060]  OK, so that's we're through the burger. Yes. So you're so you view you view Gavin
[24:44.620 --> 24:50.120]  having stabbed you in the back by refusing to to render a judgment. He never gave a ruling. Yeah,
[24:50.200 --> 24:55.280]  I felt that it was because I wasted. You didn't need to stop the clock after 25 minutes.
[24:55.700 --> 25:00.500]  Just know if you've only ordered some, just forget it. Call it a wash. Mulligan. Go again
[25:00.500 --> 25:05.540]  another time. Burgers cost money. Gavin, I spent money on those burgers. I'd like a ruling on the
[25:05.540 --> 25:10.720]  burgers. I'd like to not have to pay for additional burgers. I do think you could make a
[25:10.720 --> 25:17.460]  bit of an effort to be available, Gavin. Just over multiple days. The conversation for an immediate
[25:17.460 --> 25:22.860]  conversation was so long. By the time I was able to sit down and read it, I wasn't fully in
[25:22.860 --> 25:27.580]  understanding of what was going on. So I did ask you, Andrew, for a brief summary. And all you did
[25:27.580 --> 25:32.480]  was argue with me again. No, I did more. I explained it. Where's the summary here? I can't
[25:32.480 --> 25:37.880]  point to your summary that I was meant to be ruling on. We've had a lot of talk. I felt
[25:37.880 --> 25:41.140]  like I was very clear in explaining I ordered the wrong burgers and all that. If I didn't,
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.200]  that's on me and I apologize. That's my fault. Okay, I found the bit where I asked for a summary.
[25:45.680 --> 25:52.180]  I said, I'll need a brief summary of the events. Geoff said, why did this happen? Andrew just says,
[25:52.320 --> 25:58.620]  what do you mean? What prompted the bet lift off? It ends up just being a really long conversation.
[25:58.620 --> 26:03.800]  I said, I saw no sign off or green light. You said, didn't need one. Yeah, because we had on
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.300]  the podcast, we talked about, I didn't need that. We talked about this. Yeah, that's what you're
[26:07.300 --> 26:13.360]  referring to. And then you said Gavin sabotaged the bet. Yeah. I asked for his ruling and he
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.140]  refused to give it. Still hasn't. And at this point, you still haven't told me the summary
[26:19.140 --> 26:25.160]  of what I'm ruling over. I am so confused. I've said it three times on this podcast alone.
[26:25.160 --> 26:29.420]  Well, I know now what you were asking for. I was talking, the reason I didn't rule.
[26:30.180 --> 26:35.260]  Could you just give a ruling now? Because I open with a ruling. I'm almost certain I did. If I
[26:35.260 --> 26:39.780]  didn't, that's my fault. I don't know. Do you actually want a ruling now? I'd love one, just
[26:39.780 --> 26:44.740]  so I know. It's fine. Okay, there, that's all I was looking for. That's all I needed. That's all
[26:44.740 --> 26:51.280]  I wanted. We're good. Burgers are good. But you do understand what could have been a 30 second
[26:51.280 --> 26:58.540]  typing effort has extended into hours of slack arguing and a giant chunk of this podcast arguing
[26:58.540 --> 27:03.120]  about what you want. That's not my fault. I would say a multi-day argument. Yeah, it was. Yeah,
[27:03.180 --> 27:09.280]  at this point. Mildly infuriating. Yes, yes. I bought the burgers, how do you think I feel?
[27:09.620 --> 27:15.800]  So what happened with the bet? No, it just paused because I lost the momentum. Are we going to
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.780]  declare this a mulligan, not a failure? I just don't understand why you want a ruling if you
[27:20.780 --> 27:26.560]  stopped completely and have no intention of eating like a week old burger. Well, I was just curious
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.100]  now. I'd like a ruling now because you never gave one. So I was just curious what it was. It's
[27:30.100 --> 27:33.920]  mainly out of curiosity. It's not related to the bet. I was just curious what you'd actually say.
[27:34.040 --> 27:37.840]  Here's my thinking. As an overall, to prevent any future need of ruling,
[27:39.520 --> 27:47.600]  50 patties have to make it down your gullet with bread. 25 breads. With 25 breads. Okay,
[27:48.120 --> 27:54.240]  that's it. 25 bread combos, top and bottom. Because once again, and this is the last
[27:54.240 --> 27:57.300]  closing point on the burgers because I thought this would be a three-minute conversation.
[27:58.020 --> 28:03.260]  The whole point of the green light ahead of time was that, and we agreed, I need to feel the
[28:03.260 --> 28:08.420]  momentum and excitement. Being stalled for like eight hours, I just didn't have it in me at that
[28:08.420 --> 28:14.000]  point. The excitement died. I lost the will, Gavin. But it's all you. It all came from you.
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.440]  You were like free solo trying to go up on the wrong day. Yeah, exactly, Geoff. I can't imagine
[28:21.440 --> 28:26.800]  a bunch of people turning up to the annual hot dog eating contest and then just stopping because
[28:26.800 --> 28:32.280]  they're wheat buns instead of white. I also can't imagine them saying, we've got a discrepancy,
[28:32.340 --> 28:37.180]  can we get a ruling? And the judge not answering. Yeah, and the judge is in a different country
[28:37.180 --> 28:42.520]  doing something else. You know what the most hurtful part of that was? I saw you in a different
[28:42.520 --> 28:47.640]  Slack channel make a comment in the evening. I was like, you motherfucker. You son of a bitch.
[28:47.660 --> 28:51.860]  That's the worst. You son of a bitch. By the way, I fucking recognize every time you guys do that,
[28:51.920 --> 28:56.600]  just so you know. And I catalog it and I remember it.

[30:15.320 --> 30:20.140]  Hello, hello! The greatest love story ever told is the one between your butthole
[30:20.840 --> 30:27.160]  and Hello Tushy. There's nothing more romantic than true love's kiss, aka the kiss of your sweet
[30:27.160 --> 30:35.060]  anus kissing the refreshing, clean, electrolyzed water of the Hello Tushy spray up in your butthole
[30:35.060 --> 30:37.680]  keeping it clean, keeping it happy, keeping it fresh.
[30:37.980 --> 30:42.860]  It's the future of toileting and it has arrived. And it has been here for a very,
[30:43.080 --> 30:47.820]  very long time. It arrived thousands of years ago. It just didn't make its way to America
[30:47.820 --> 30:57.200]  when people loaded up all the... well, when the Europeans, at least, loaded up all their shit
[30:57.200 --> 31:01.700]  and moved over on the boats. They didn't bring their bidets. They left that technology behind
[31:01.700 --> 31:04.880]  and it's taken us years and years and years to catch back up.
[31:04.940 --> 31:10.380]  But here we are, thankfully, with the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 modern bidet attachment,
[31:10.780 --> 31:15.580]  which levels the playing field. It's the stylish, eco-friendly, easy-to-install,
[31:15.760 --> 31:22.200]  affordable way to go to the bathroom and make your butt smile with freshness and cleanness.
[31:22.460 --> 31:25.880]  And it just, it makes you feel a little bit more alive, if I'm being honest with you.
[31:25.880 --> 31:30.400]  You've heard me talk about it a million times. I love my butt. I love my toilet.
[31:30.960 --> 31:35.600]  I love my bidet. And you put those three together and it is a... they call it the
[31:35.600 --> 31:41.160]  triangle of anal success. Because with Hello Tushy, you don't even have to wipe.
[31:41.520 --> 31:46.500]  You just poop, spray, dry, and go. They call that the quadrant of success.
[31:46.900 --> 31:51.780]  Poop in one side, spray in the other, dry in the other, and go. It's the square of success.
[31:52.180 --> 31:56.180]  And let's not forget, there's a certain special day coming up. And for that special someone in
[31:56.180 --> 32:01.560]  your life, that rump you would love to hump, this Valentine's Day, give the gift of Hello Tushy.

[32:16.720 --> 32:23.040]  Hello, hello, hello, fresh. What is hello fresh, Geoff, you might be saying to me. And I would say
[32:23.040 --> 32:27.620]  why are you asking me a question? This is not a two-way conversation, but I'm going to answer
[32:27.620 --> 32:33.240]  it just this once. It is a way to cut out the stress of meal planning and grocery store trips
[32:33.240 --> 32:37.860]  so that you can enjoy the fun part, which is cooking and getting dinner on the table in about
[32:37.860 --> 32:45.300]  30 minutes or less. I don't know about you, but thanks to the internet and TV on demand and video
[32:45.300 --> 32:52.880]  games and robot cars and everything else going on in the world, my attention span is about 32 minutes
[32:52.880 --> 32:59.720]  or less. So cooking without HelloFresh is a long, arduous, boring process. So thanks for the time
[32:59.720 --> 33:04.940]  back, HelloFresh. I appreciate it. I can now use it to spend more time on TikTok and on Instagram.
[33:05.180 --> 33:10.100]  HelloFresh offers 23 recipes a week featuring a range of flavors, cuisines, and ingredients,
[33:10.220 --> 33:16.880]  so you'll never get bored. But even worse than boredom is eating unhealthy. I just hate it.
[33:17.120 --> 33:22.260]  I hate it. It's the worst. Gross, gross, gross. What I want to do is I want to eat healthy. I
[33:22.260 --> 33:26.800]  want to be carb smart. I want to be vegetarian and pescetarian at the same time. Those things
[33:26.800 --> 33:31.560]  don't conflict if you don't want them to. And no matter what you choose, every single recipe from
[33:31.560 --> 33:37.940]  HelloFresh will be packed with locally sourced, direct from farmer produce, whatever available,
[33:38.120 --> 33:42.960]  cut down on grocery bills by saving up to 40% instead of shopping at your local store. HelloFresh
[33:42.960 --> 33:47.680]  delivers pre-proportioned ingredients, so you're not overbuying, which is a burden on the planet
[33:47.680 --> 33:52.200]  and the wallet, and it's kind of the American way. Buy, buy, buy. That's what we do. We just
[33:52.200 --> 33:59.120]  consume and buy and own. But listen, I only need so much tarragon. And for me to hold on,
[33:59.180 --> 34:04.000]  think of the warehousing fees just on spices alone in your house. If you had to pay like a
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.100]  warehousing fee for each can of spice or each shaker of spice that you're probably never going
[34:10.100 --> 34:14.120]  to use. So get it with HelloFresh with a little pre-proportioned ingredient. You get exactly what
[34:14.120 --> 34:19.680]  there's no anything else to hang on to. You're not overburdened. You're not in that whole like,
[34:19.960 --> 34:27.320]  you know, your belongings own you, Tyler Durden type scenario. They're really, they're freeing

[34:50.760 --> 34:54.740]  All right, so that's knife one. That's right. That's knife one. Well, one and two because
[34:54.740 --> 35:00.500]  of Eric's knife. Yes. Oh, right. So what about the other knife? We had a vote. Who should set
[35:00.500 --> 35:07.720]  this? Should I set this up? I think you're the one who feels slighted and you're the one with
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.360]  the issue. So I think it's fair that you should be able to express that. Okay. Well, we had,
[35:13.580 --> 35:19.200]  so Eric asked if he said there's another podcast, they want to put a trailer on the RSS feed for
[35:19.200 --> 35:24.940]  this podcast. Is that a big deal or do we care? Yes or no? Are we okay with it? I don't think
[35:24.940 --> 35:29.220]  any of us care. I think we're all fine with it. Gavin immediately, or Geoff immediately said yes.
[35:29.580 --> 35:36.060]  Then Gavin said he voted no because he wanted to put me in a swing vote position,
[35:36.060 --> 35:42.340]  which I viewed as an act of war. You said, I wish I had the exact wording,
[35:42.560 --> 35:45.600]  but your wording was very much like, I'm going to say no, just to be interesting.
[35:46.080 --> 35:52.020]  And I'm going to put all the pressure of this choice on Andrew. I've watched 40 seasons of
[35:52.020 --> 35:58.400]  fucking Survivor. You do not try to pressure me in a vote scenario. Doesn't happen. You don't
[35:58.400 --> 36:04.740]  fuck with me in a vote. All I'm doing is giving you the entire vote. No, you're not. That's
[36:04.740 --> 36:08.520]  another thing I'm going to dispute. We went over that. I wish we didn't have a million fucking
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.340]  messages. I'm going to try to scroll to find our conversation. So I thought about this for quite
[36:13.340 --> 36:20.200]  a bit. Oh, I found it. Okay. I said, I'm going to say no, just so that Andrew has to be the one
[36:20.200 --> 36:24.800]  who decides the outcome. Yeah. I viewed that as an act of war. I viewed that as you're trying
[36:24.800 --> 36:31.540]  to put me in an odd spot. And I took that personally. I did. I took it personally. I
[36:31.540 --> 36:36.180]  can't find the conversation, but I essentially said that I'm betting Gavin is assuming I'm going
[36:36.180 --> 36:42.820]  to say yes. So to get back at Gavin, to fuck with Gavin, I think I'm going to say no. Because
[36:42.820 --> 36:47.860]  in a scenario in which there's a two no vote on a three vote, it doesn't really matter who the
[36:47.860 --> 36:52.580]  swing is. Two votes equally mean the same. Yeah. You guys are fucking annoying. That's for sure.
[36:54.660 --> 36:59.660]  So we went through this whole thing and I felt that I was pretty clear constantly in my messaging of
[36:59.660 --> 37:06.900]  that I am voting no purely to make Gavin uncomfortable. Because I live in a different
[37:06.900 --> 37:11.180]  country. The person whose podcast it is, I don't work with them. I don't really interact with them.
[37:11.280 --> 37:15.060]  I have no issue with them. I think they're great. Don't really talk to them. Gavin,
[37:15.180 --> 37:19.080]  you might be at a Christmas party with this person. There's going to be some level of social
[37:19.080 --> 37:24.580]  interaction. And I figured they'd be on another podcast with you to promote it. And so the timing
[37:24.580 --> 37:28.040]  of it could have been really funny where it's awkward. If we're the only show that doesn't
[37:28.040 --> 37:33.000]  promote this other show, I thought that could be really funny. That person is already, I'm pretty
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.420]  sure, convinced that Gavin and I hate him. So I don't think this is helping. Well, that was the
[37:40.420 --> 37:47.300]  entire thing. It had nothing to do with them. It had everything to do with making it as uncomfortable
[37:47.300 --> 37:52.760]  for Gavin as possible because I felt like he was trying to put me in a corner and I flipped it on
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.160]  him. I can read what you wrote. This is an interesting position to be in. I immediately
[37:57.160 --> 38:02.480]  want to say no because I imagine Gavin is anticipating me as a yes vote. If we are
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.120]  the only show that doesn't, it probably gets noticed by him and he definitely wouldn't want
[38:07.120 --> 38:13.040]  to put the blame on me. If he asked Eric why, he would have to say Gavin and Andrew voted no,
[38:13.280 --> 38:19.140]  which would make me feel sort of bad, but it would be much more awkward for you, I imagine.
[38:19.680 --> 38:23.420]  I would feel bad, but once again, it's much more painful for you.
[38:24.460 --> 38:32.260]  It's all about making it as miserable for you. So then you're on a podcast. They're promoting
[38:32.260 --> 38:37.380]  the podcast with you and you brought this up. Can we go further? That's not where the votes
[38:37.380 --> 38:41.140]  ended though. Okay. There was additional voting between that point and the podcast. Another great
[38:41.140 --> 38:46.500]  point, Geoff. The reason we're now at a tie. I think it's a what? No, we're not. We're at 2-1
[38:46.500 --> 38:53.180]  right now. No. We're at 3-3 now, but we were at 2-1 at that moment. We were at 2-1. So then I've
[38:53.180 --> 38:59.720]  said, I got one of the editors, I asked their opinion, they voted, and then I used my second
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.500]  account to rebalance the vote. So we're at a tie. Remember that two Slack accounts? Yeah,
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.440]  they voted yes. And so I was like, well, just to be funny, I forgot I have two accounts. I
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.240]  technically have two votes, so I'll just vote no again. So we're back at a tie. But the whole
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.680]  reason why we're at a tie right now and it's not a no vote is because I asked if I could change my
[39:17.680 --> 39:22.220]  vote and I also asked somebody else if they wanted to vote. So if anything, I'm the reason
[39:22.220 --> 39:27.560]  why we're tied and that it's not a no. This was not... it's an important detail to remember later.
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.600]  Who were the three yes votes? Me, Eric, and who? The editor. The editor. Wait,
[39:33.740 --> 39:39.100]  did Eric even vote? Eric didn't vote. I thought he voted yes. Eric and I were...
[39:39.100 --> 39:43.460]  Not on the Slack. I don't know if he voted somewhere else. Didn't vote in the Slack
[39:43.460 --> 39:46.060]  conversation. I originally thought Eric did vote, but looking back on it, he was...
[39:46.560 --> 39:49.560]  Yeah, I also thought he voted. He was just yelling at us to vote.
[39:49.560 --> 39:55.100]  There's three of you. It should just be an easy vote.
[39:58.960 --> 40:00.160]  Unfortunately, it was.
[40:02.020 --> 40:07.660]  Look, you know the show we started here, Eric, and you expect to do normal business in our Slack
[40:07.660 --> 40:12.600]  channel? Yeah, you know, honestly, yes, I did. And that's my mistake, apparently.
[40:16.260 --> 40:23.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we're tied 3-3. And then, honestly, and then I think everybody,
[40:24.120 --> 40:27.180]  with the exception of maybe Eric, who still had to deal with it, I think all of us forgot that
[40:27.180 --> 40:32.180]  that happened, right? Like it left, it was just like a week later. In my head, I was like, ah,
[40:32.180 --> 40:35.820]  that was funny. I mean, obviously, we're going to put it in. Yeah, same, but I don't think we
[40:35.820 --> 40:39.960]  ever doubled back and readdressed or anything. We just left it and we just left that business
[40:39.960 --> 40:45.140]  unfinished. And then, yeah, Eric really wanted to talk about it on the other podcast that we were
[40:45.140 --> 40:51.800]  on. That's true. I wanted to talk about it because I knew I could get it resolved. That's it. All I
[40:51.800 --> 40:57.220]  wanted was resolution. And I knew that that would be a point of resolution in that moment. And I was
[40:57.220 --> 41:04.740]  fine with it. Obviously, again, I was wrong. Right. But I feel like at that point, I did have to
[41:04.740 --> 41:09.260]  explain the situation to John, which I knew we would have to do at, you know, the moment we
[41:09.260 --> 41:12.820]  started having the discussion. I thought this would be he'll find this funny, probably eventually.
[41:14.180 --> 41:19.300]  So I explained it all to him. And Andrew absolutely livid about it.
[41:19.740 --> 41:26.340]  You okay. So you explained it. One, I think the outcome of the story is really important because
[41:26.340 --> 41:32.460]  that whole conversation ends with him saying, with John saying, I didn't realize Andrew hated me.
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.700]  And not even in a jokey way. It's just like a like a it was a point of like realization.
[41:37.700 --> 41:44.180]  I don't know at all. So I feel like at that point, you voted failing on your I voted no because of
[41:44.180 --> 41:50.440]  Gavin because I also don't hate John. And I voted no. I did it because of the face, Eric. I don't
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.320]  know, man. If I were John, I might feel like you both fucking hate me right now because you both
[41:55.320 --> 42:01.860]  voted no. Maybe you don't hate me, but I would think like maybe I'm so inconsequential that a
[42:01.860 --> 42:07.440]  lame throwaway joke is funnier to make than to help me in my career. That's maybe what I would
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.520]  think. This is way better promotion, though. Yeah. What's the name of the fucking podcast,
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.340]  Gavin? This whole conversation for some reason has been not naming that podcast
[42:18.340 --> 42:25.300]  or the Rooster Teeth podcast, and I can't figure out why. I don't know why I just started following
[42:25.300 --> 42:29.160]  along with that. I always felt bad saying John because I realized no one else had. I don't know
[42:29.160 --> 42:34.180]  why. Why are we omitting all the names? Yeah, I don't know either. I have no idea. It's just
[42:34.760 --> 42:40.440]  poor fucking John. Poor real canon. Poor them for just having to deal with us. Honestly, what I
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.160]  wanted. This is this is my whole plan with the no vote. And once again, I told you this, Gavin,
[42:45.240 --> 42:50.840]  you knew this wasn't presented in your version of how that vote happened. I wanted it to be a no
[42:50.840 --> 42:56.940]  vote. I didn't want the podcast trailer on our feed because I was going to tell John that.
[42:57.260 --> 43:00.980]  And I figured John would be on the Rooster Teeth podcast and I would talk to him and say,
[43:00.980 --> 43:04.580]  it'd be funny if you kind of acted annoyed about Gavin because I assume the trailer would have
[43:04.580 --> 43:08.940]  been out before you did that podcast. And so there'd be a reason for him to naturally realize
[43:08.940 --> 43:13.880]  we're the only show that didn't have the trailer on it. And then I could bring it up on the show
[43:13.880 --> 43:18.800]  as like it was a planned bit. And it would be way better advertising for the show than it was if we
[43:18.800 --> 43:24.240]  just had a trailer. It would be content. That was my thing. But the way the story was presented
[43:24.240 --> 43:29.120]  was just that I hate John. That isn't at all the case. I don't think I presented it that way. I
[43:29.120 --> 43:34.320]  explained the situation. And the reason that it happened was because it's a f*** face.
[43:34.720 --> 43:40.000]  So at this point, at this point in the situation, by the way, Andrew, I think that that's some
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.640]  brilliant marketing on your part. Works better if you let anybody else on earth know about it.
[43:44.960 --> 43:46.400]  Well, I would tell them on the show.
[43:46.880 --> 43:50.060]  No, why would I? Why would I need to let you know about that?
[43:50.400 --> 43:51.420]  You have no role in this.
[43:51.500 --> 43:56.390]  We all deal in this show together. We all promote this show together. You don't know what I or
[43:56.390 --> 44:00.190]  Gavin could be on and how it could come up naturally and then sandbag your joke.
[44:01.590 --> 44:06.270]  But I don't like what you're saying. Like, this was all behind the scenes stuff. Only John and I
[44:06.270 --> 44:10.490]  would know. And I let Eric know. And then I realized, well, the dates are just not going
[44:10.490 --> 44:14.430]  to line up. So it doesn't matter. It didn't work. Okay. So it was a possibility.
[44:14.630 --> 44:18.570]  Which part of my retelling did you have the issue with? What part did you take to the judge?
[44:18.990 --> 44:25.610]  I just I felt like you didn't at all articulate my motive. The motive you gave was just like I
[44:25.610 --> 44:28.250]  was against it because I thought it was funny to be against it.
[44:28.350 --> 44:30.490]  But you did think it was funny to be against it.
[44:30.690 --> 44:36.070]  Yeah, but specifically funny because it would make you feel bad and it was bad for you.
[44:36.450 --> 44:42.190]  Your anger is that it was an oversimplification of the complex comedy.
[44:42.370 --> 44:45.490]  Because I made it seem like you didn't like John when in fact you don't like me.
[44:45.850 --> 44:49.370]  No, I think you're great, but I enjoy making you uncomfortable.
[44:49.530 --> 44:49.790]  Yeah.
[44:50.310 --> 44:51.950]  For the show specifically.
[44:52.130 --> 44:53.010]  So then what happened?
[44:53.010 --> 44:58.890]  So that was my issue. The issue was I did not feel my motive was presented accurately.
[44:59.230 --> 45:02.050]  Had nothing to do with John. Had everything to do with you.
[45:02.130 --> 45:05.910]  So not necessarily a lie. It was just more of a mission.
[45:06.830 --> 45:12.430]  Yes. Your version of the story was very much like Andrew kind of forced a no vote.
[45:12.570 --> 45:16.930]  Where it was like, no, I mean, if I did, it was because of Gavin putting me in that position.
[45:16.930 --> 45:18.110]  You did force a no vote.
[45:18.510 --> 45:22.730]  I did, but because you put me in that position because you're trying to put me in a corner.
[45:22.730 --> 45:28.430]  You keep taking the outcome and adding something behind it that doesn't change the outcome.
[45:29.210 --> 45:32.290]  He also acknowledged that he did that in the retelling.
[45:32.450 --> 45:37.190]  He said, I voted no to force Andrew to have to be the swing vote because I thought it would
[45:37.190 --> 45:41.250]  make him uncomfortable. Like he's acknowledging that his part in it and that he also said no.
[45:42.110 --> 45:46.850]  I just felt that the telling of the story was mainly slanted on me being the no guy
[45:46.850 --> 45:49.710]  without my motive. That's what I felt was a betrayal.
[45:50.290 --> 45:52.570]  And I was a little sensitive after the burger ruling.
[45:52.570 --> 45:55.550]  That also probably played a factor. I was on edge with the burger.
[45:56.130 --> 45:56.950]  This was a one-two.
[45:57.670 --> 46:05.290]  I would argue, I would argue, Andrew, that if the two of you together, let's leave fake
[46:05.290 --> 46:09.610]  accounts and editors and stuff out. We get to the original three votes, right?
[46:09.910 --> 46:14.590]  The two of you together comprise 100% of the no vote, right?
[46:14.610 --> 46:14.910]  Yes.
[46:15.690 --> 46:20.870]  Gavin went first, you went second. Now, I would argue that because you went second and you had
[46:20.870 --> 46:27.810]  the knowledge of knowing that your vote is the swing vote, I would argue that at best Gavin had
[46:27.810 --> 46:32.610]  a 49% of that no vote and you had 51%. That's absurd. That's a ridiculous statement to make
[46:32.610 --> 46:37.190]  because you need both votes for a no. It doesn't matter who's first. That's what I was arguing.
[46:37.690 --> 46:39.570]  Yeah, but one has already happened and you've seen it.
[46:39.810 --> 46:40.750]  You have knowledge. That doesn't matter.
[46:40.830 --> 46:42.430]  You have prior knowledge. That is such bullshit.
[46:42.690 --> 46:44.130]  No, that doesn't matter at all.
[46:44.190 --> 46:47.570]  If it were the other way and it was I was a yes and you were a no and then Gavin was
[46:47.570 --> 46:51.010]  the swing vote and he voted no, I would say he was 51% responsible.
[46:51.650 --> 46:56.790]  Okay, but do you agree if somebody declares an act of war on you, you need to respond?
[46:56.990 --> 46:58.310]  I totally understand that.
[46:58.430 --> 47:03.950]  I had to respond. Gavin put me in this position to do it and then told a story in which I was
[47:03.950 --> 47:07.130]  the sole bad guy when really he's the one that initiated it.
[47:07.150 --> 47:08.150]  I said that I initiated it.
[47:09.090 --> 47:13.370]  So then you took it to the world's most impartial judge and I looked at all the data.
[47:13.570 --> 47:15.530]  I've got the ruling right here.
[47:15.590 --> 47:16.710]  Yeah, you read the ruling, Gavin.
[47:16.710 --> 47:18.130]  It was a whole thing.
[47:18.510 --> 47:22.490]  We obviously, once again, had the argument about whether the judge was impartial.
[47:23.010 --> 47:25.690]  I guess we eventually said that Geoff, in fact, was impartial.
[47:26.070 --> 47:28.070]  Geoff writes, impartially.
[47:28.770 --> 47:33.190]  If I think anyone threw you under the bus, Andrew, it was Eric.
[47:34.050 --> 47:38.930]  As Gavin made a tiny effort to bring it up, it got passed by and Eric jumped in to make
[47:38.930 --> 47:39.950]  sure it was addressed.
[47:40.610 --> 47:45.350]  And the way he said it implied controversy, which Gavin then had to play to.
[47:45.350 --> 47:51.550]  That being said, I didn't really feel like any of it was character shaming or assassinating.
[47:51.790 --> 47:56.090]  And if anything, you came across sounding funnier and comedically maniacal.
[47:56.570 --> 47:58.550]  I think Gavin kind of talked you up.
[47:58.890 --> 48:01.710]  My judgment is that no offense was committed or intended.
[48:02.270 --> 48:04.290]  Eric replies with a picture of a gavel.
[48:05.410 --> 48:08.470]  Yeah, I respect that you feel that way.
[48:08.570 --> 48:09.010]  I disagree.
[48:09.350 --> 48:11.550]  But I'm not, you know, that's how it goes.
[48:11.970 --> 48:14.190]  Thank you for showing me the respect.
[48:14.310 --> 48:15.070]  I respect you as well.
[48:15.350 --> 48:21.850]  I think the issue I had more with it was that the only person that seemed to clearly articulate
[48:21.850 --> 48:26.330]  what my intent was Barbara, who had the least amount of context for any of the stuff that
[48:26.330 --> 48:26.590]  happened.
[48:27.090 --> 48:27.650]  He had no clue.
[48:28.730 --> 48:30.810]  John was like, I think, I guess he hates me.
[48:30.890 --> 48:32.470]  And she's like, I don't think he hates you.
[48:32.670 --> 48:35.350]  I think it's how much he hates Gavin or the show.
[48:35.770 --> 48:39.050]  It's like, yeah, it has nothing to do with John or the podcast.
[48:39.690 --> 48:42.110]  It's everything to do with Gavin, making Gavin uncomfortable.
[48:42.110 --> 48:46.830]  And he forced the situation by putting me in a pressure swing position.
[48:47.670 --> 48:49.390]  And thus ends the second knife.
[48:50.210 --> 48:51.050]  Thus ends the second knife.
[48:51.070 --> 48:51.710]  I'm going to be careful.
[48:51.810 --> 48:56.690]  I don't sort of stub my toe later today and find out I've stabbed you a third time in
[48:56.690 --> 48:58.110]  the back or looked at you funny.
[48:58.330 --> 49:04.890]  The problem with comedy is that it's edgy and very often when you throw a comedic bomb
[49:04.890 --> 49:06.650]  out there, people get shrapnel.
[49:07.010 --> 49:10.070]  John was going to get hit with some shrapnel one way or the other in this.
[49:10.070 --> 49:11.270]  And it sucks for him.
[49:11.370 --> 49:14.310]  But if you're going to be a fearless comedian, that's the price people pay.
[49:14.530 --> 49:17.990]  But you should check out his wonderful new podcast, Real Cannon.
[49:18.330 --> 49:21.050]  There may or may not be a trailer in the feed of this podcast.
[49:21.090 --> 49:21.710]  Can I put it up?
[49:21.710 --> 49:22.890]  Fucking who knows, dude?
[49:24.750 --> 49:25.690]  I don't know!
[49:26.010 --> 49:26.430]  That's all!
[49:26.570 --> 49:28.090]  If you still don't know, when are you going to do it?
[49:28.190 --> 49:30.850]  This whole thing has just been me trying to get a resolution.
[49:31.490 --> 49:33.090]  I just want to know if I can put it up.
[49:35.210 --> 49:35.570]  Let's...
[49:35.570 --> 49:36.190]  Yeah, I have no issue with it.
[49:36.550 --> 49:37.130]  Let's vote.
[49:37.230 --> 49:38.550]  All right, Andrew, we'll vote again.
[49:38.610 --> 49:39.870]  We'll do a new vote, the three of us.
[49:39.870 --> 49:40.810]  Andrew, you go first.
[49:40.910 --> 49:42.550]  Yeah, I'm totally fine with it.
[49:42.590 --> 49:42.970]  I don't care.
[49:43.430 --> 49:43.770]  Okay.
[49:44.170 --> 49:44.470]  Gavin?
[49:44.730 --> 49:45.210]  Absolutely.
[49:45.970 --> 49:47.210]  I'm going to be a no.
[49:49.170 --> 49:50.810]  Two to one, you guys win.
[49:51.050 --> 49:54.210]  I disagree with your decision, but that's democracy for you.
[49:54.550 --> 49:55.350]  That's how it works.
[49:56.370 --> 50:00.950]  No love for John here from me, but good on you guys.
[50:02.950 --> 50:03.550]  Happy, Eric?
[50:03.850 --> 50:04.210]  Thrilled.
[50:04.350 --> 50:04.870]  Thanks, guys.
[50:05.110 --> 50:05.490]  We good?
[50:05.910 --> 50:06.210]  All right.
[50:06.350 --> 50:06.510]  Great.
[50:06.610 --> 50:07.470]  We did good work here.
[50:07.510 --> 50:08.930]  It only took, I think, a week.
[50:08.930 --> 50:10.290]  Was that a week ago?
[50:12.270 --> 50:16.130]  I don't know how we talk about nothing for so long.
[50:16.750 --> 50:17.190]  We fight.
[50:17.390 --> 50:18.550]  I was thinking about this earlier.
[50:19.090 --> 50:22.870]  If I had to describe this podcast, this 36 episode podcast,
[50:23.190 --> 50:25.750]  I would just say it's 36 episodes of one argument.
[50:26.250 --> 50:30.230]  And it goes in different tangents, but it's still essentially just an argument.
[50:30.430 --> 50:31.990]  I was listening to one of these the other day.
[50:32.410 --> 50:34.230]  I guess I never used the podcast app.
[50:34.290 --> 50:36.370]  I wanted to hear one of the ads just to see what we were getting.
[50:36.370 --> 50:38.810]  And then it just played an old podcast.
[50:39.170 --> 50:41.490]  Andrew, you're a lot more quiet on the early ones.
[50:41.550 --> 50:46.830]  You were sort of very sort of like gentle soul compared to the animal that you've become.
[50:46.950 --> 50:49.910]  But I was listening to a really funny bit about how Geoff,
[50:49.970 --> 50:52.890]  you were talking about infamous second son or whatever,
[50:52.890 --> 50:57.470]  and how you captured a bunch of video without the red component cable plugged in.
[50:58.290 --> 51:01.870]  And I was like, oh, I remember him telling the story, but I never went and looked at the videos.
[51:02.350 --> 51:05.310]  And I couldn't tell whether you were joking or not about uploading those.
[51:05.310 --> 51:07.010]  And you weren't.
[51:07.090 --> 51:07.550]  They're up there.
[51:08.910 --> 51:11.930]  Because in my head, I was like, oh, I just like the red channels missing.
[51:12.890 --> 51:15.530]  Maybe it just looked cool, like a cool stylistic choice.
[51:15.990 --> 51:17.610]  It looks absurd.
[51:18.110 --> 51:20.270]  Like not only is there a bunch of color missing,
[51:20.710 --> 51:24.650]  but there's like clearly like vertical scan timing that's gone all wrong.
[51:24.750 --> 51:28.370]  There's like weird glitches and lines flipping about all over the place.
[51:28.590 --> 51:31.110]  And you're just like, but you want to walk over.
[51:31.910 --> 51:32.930]  Here's the deal, dude.
[51:33.110 --> 51:33.570]  Here's the deal.
[51:33.570 --> 51:36.710]  First off, I played, I almost beat the game like that.
[51:37.010 --> 51:41.610]  I played like, I was probably 15 hours in before Michael noticed that you showed me.
[51:43.450 --> 51:45.130]  But it's like so infamous.
[51:45.270 --> 51:48.070]  Second Son, if you're not familiar with it, it was a PS4 game, I believe.
[51:49.090 --> 51:50.050]  Or PS3, PS4?
[51:50.190 --> 51:50.830]  I don't know, who cares?
[51:50.950 --> 51:52.350]  It's probably PS3 if you're using components.
[51:52.370 --> 51:53.590]  It's probably PS3, yeah.
[51:53.770 --> 52:00.070]  And it's like an open world game about a dude in like a post-apocalyptic cityscape kind of thing.
[52:00.530 --> 52:02.190]  And with like superpowers and shit.
[52:02.190 --> 52:05.170]  So I assumed that it was a stylistic choice,
[52:05.270 --> 52:08.050]  because it's like a near-future Dark World kind of thing.
[52:08.750 --> 52:10.410]  I just embraced it.
[52:10.410 --> 52:11.930]  What was the style, shit?
[52:12.090 --> 52:14.310]  That would be the worst style ever.
[52:14.610 --> 52:17.530]  I wouldn't have played for more than about seven seconds before I was like,
[52:17.570 --> 52:18.610]  oh, something's wrong here.
[52:18.830 --> 52:21.890]  We really just wanted to feel like every scene was garbage.
[52:22.190 --> 52:26.210]  Just like it was filmed with a smeared lens and there was only green.
[52:26.730 --> 52:29.470]  Or you had a magnet on top of your TV or something.
[52:31.150 --> 52:31.950]  Here's the deal.
[52:31.950 --> 52:34.130]  If you follow those guides, you'll get those trophies.
[52:38.110 --> 52:40.110]  You must have mentioned it earlier too,
[52:40.190 --> 52:41.370]  because all the comments are like,
[52:41.750 --> 52:44.390]  oh boy, Geoff forgot to plug in the red cable.
[52:44.550 --> 52:46.990]  But those comments are from like seven years ago.
[52:50.190 --> 52:51.990]  Yeah, it's not by my strong suit.
[52:52.410 --> 52:54.370]  Have you been able to play Hitman 3, Gavin?
[52:55.590 --> 52:57.030]  I played one for a video.
[52:57.390 --> 52:59.930]  I'm going to play the first level again though,
[52:59.930 --> 53:05.530]  I was in a on-camera goofy mode instead of I want to listen and hear the story mode.
[53:05.810 --> 53:08.050]  Also, I downloaded it right before we started this.
[53:08.070 --> 53:10.390]  I wanted to try and play before we started recording this very episode.
[53:10.750 --> 53:15.590]  You know how you can download like 40% of the game and then play?
[53:16.830 --> 53:17.810]  So I did that.
[53:17.990 --> 53:22.470]  The game wasn't fully downloaded, but none of the dialogue was there.
[53:22.550 --> 53:23.230]  It was just music.
[53:23.550 --> 53:25.250]  So I think they let you play the first level,
[53:25.250 --> 53:31.850]  but maybe the sound and the audio recordings are all in the last 90% or something.
[53:32.130 --> 53:35.250]  I find that like, I would say like nine times out of ten,
[53:35.350 --> 53:38.890]  when you can play a game before it's fully downloaded, the experience isn't worth it.
[53:39.010 --> 53:39.850]  Definitely hit or miss.
[53:40.010 --> 53:42.930]  Sometimes it's just, oh, you can go on the menu now.
[53:43.090 --> 53:43.850]  Yes, yeah.
[53:43.850 --> 53:48.030]  Or like Plants vs. Zombies, you can just walk around a mini-map.
[53:48.110 --> 53:48.670]  It's like, cool.
[53:49.110 --> 53:51.370]  Yeah, that was probably the most pointless feature.
[53:52.230 --> 53:53.370]  Yeah, it didn't work at all.
[53:53.370 --> 53:56.350]  I'm frustrated with Hitman 3 because I love Hitman.
[53:56.550 --> 53:58.470]  It's one of my favorite video game series ever.
[53:58.930 --> 53:59.870]  I play them so much.
[53:59.930 --> 54:00.770]  I love those games.
[54:01.390 --> 54:02.850]  The third one just came out.
[54:03.170 --> 54:06.330]  And when you're loading into the third one, you get prompted with the screen saying,
[54:06.490 --> 54:09.330]  do you want to carry over all your progress from Hitman 2?
[54:09.370 --> 54:10.330]  And I believe Hitman 1.
[54:10.850 --> 54:11.790]  Definitely Hitman 2.
[54:12.010 --> 54:14.670]  Well, Hitman 2 had Hitman 1 levels as a part of it.
[54:14.830 --> 54:18.130]  So if you played Hitman 1 on Hitman 2, you can take that with you.
[54:18.790 --> 54:20.190]  Okay, I did do that.
[54:20.310 --> 54:21.770]  I played so much Hitman 2.
[54:21.850 --> 54:22.870]  I love those games.
[54:23.550 --> 54:25.850]  And so I was like, yeah, I'll carry my progress over.
[54:26.090 --> 54:26.210]  Perfect.
[54:26.370 --> 54:27.890]  All my unlocks, all my stats.
[54:28.010 --> 54:28.770]  I love that stuff.
[54:29.050 --> 54:29.750]  Let's do it.
[54:29.830 --> 54:30.870]  The website's down.
[54:31.170 --> 54:31.910]  The transfer stuff.
[54:32.110 --> 54:32.330]  Yeah.
[54:32.450 --> 54:33.110]  Doesn't work.
[54:33.430 --> 54:34.370]  Haven't been able to play it.
[54:34.570 --> 54:37.990]  And if you play Hitman 3, if you start it and then transfer it after,
[54:38.150 --> 54:40.970]  you lose everything you earned in the time between.
[54:41.050 --> 54:42.290]  Well, I just can't play Hitman 3.
[54:42.310 --> 54:42.770]  It's up now.
[54:43.010 --> 54:44.810]  I already transferred my stuff earlier.
[54:45.630 --> 54:46.630]  No, it doesn't work for me.
[54:47.330 --> 54:49.110]  No, I just tried.
[54:49.210 --> 54:50.130]  I tried it while we're talking.
[54:50.210 --> 54:51.030]  It still does not load.
[54:51.170 --> 54:51.850]  It's still broken.
[54:51.850 --> 54:53.390]  Maybe it doesn't like Canadians.
[54:53.930 --> 54:54.250]  Maybe.
[54:54.710 --> 54:54.950]  Maybe.
[54:55.250 --> 54:55.850]  It's a great game.
[54:56.210 --> 54:56.630]  Is it?
[54:56.790 --> 54:56.910]  Good.
[54:57.150 --> 54:58.490]  Well, I mean, just the franchise in general.
[54:58.650 --> 54:58.950]  It's awesome.
[54:59.250 --> 54:59.630]  Oh, okay.
[54:59.990 --> 55:00.070]  Yeah.
[55:00.090 --> 55:01.150]  I don't think I've ever played that game.
[55:01.350 --> 55:03.510]  I mean, other than like doing like two videos with you, Gavin.
[55:03.650 --> 55:04.230]  They're so good.
[55:04.430 --> 55:04.870]  Puddle Pile.
[55:05.330 --> 55:07.130]  I like that Cyberpunk.
[55:07.650 --> 55:08.310]  You still playing it?
[55:08.430 --> 55:09.070]  Fuck yeah, dude.
[55:09.090 --> 55:09.530]  Every day.
[55:09.730 --> 55:10.830]  I play it for like an hour every day.
[55:10.950 --> 55:11.690]  Just do side missions.
[55:12.050 --> 55:15.390]  I just, honestly, I just, it's gonna sound dark,
[55:16.530 --> 55:19.650]  but there's something just works so well about it.
[55:19.650 --> 55:23.870]  I just, I just walk around with a shotgun and dismember people.
[55:26.030 --> 55:27.250]  So are you done with Cyberpunk?
[55:27.350 --> 55:27.950]  Have you beaten it?
[55:28.330 --> 55:28.590]  Who, me?
[55:28.790 --> 55:29.130]  And who?
[55:29.210 --> 55:29.390]  Yeah.
[55:29.610 --> 55:30.050]  No, I haven't beaten it yet.
[55:30.050 --> 55:30.710]  I know you're done.
[55:31.350 --> 55:31.550]  Yeah.
[55:32.310 --> 55:33.730]  Is it taking a backseat to Hitman now?
[55:33.890 --> 55:34.210]  Yeah.
[55:34.990 --> 55:35.570]  I'll come back to it.
[55:35.590 --> 55:35.970]  I don't know how that goes.
[55:36.070 --> 55:38.130]  Maybe a couple of patches later, I'll come back to it.
[55:38.450 --> 55:39.170]  I don't know how that goes.
[55:39.370 --> 55:41.170]  Poor, uh, poor Gems of War.
[55:41.330 --> 55:44.110]  It's just, uh, it's collecting dust right now while I play Cyberpunk.
[55:44.730 --> 55:46.830]  Well, you played also Fallout 3 for you.
[55:47.710 --> 55:48.330]  Fuck off.
[55:50.490 --> 55:51.170]  I'll get back to it.
[55:51.170 --> 55:53.990]  Have you played through the parade mission yet, Geoff, in the campaign?
[55:54.010 --> 55:54.610]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:54.610 --> 55:55.210]  Have you gotten that far?
[55:55.810 --> 55:57.190]  Did you know, I don't know.
[55:57.470 --> 55:59.110]  Are we in like a point where we can talk?
[55:59.190 --> 56:00.890]  Well, I don't know about spoiler talk.
[56:00.970 --> 56:02.950]  I don't think this will even, I'll just be super vague.
[56:03.190 --> 56:03.790]  I haven't done that yet.
[56:03.790 --> 56:05.890]  I'll be, okay, I'll be super vague.
[56:05.970 --> 56:09.090]  It's one, it's one of the coolest missions in a video game that I've done in a while.
[56:10.170 --> 56:14.650]  After that mission, there's a thing that can happen that's optional that you can miss.
[56:14.730 --> 56:15.590]  Did you miss it, Geoff?
[56:15.990 --> 56:18.450]  Are you aware that there's an optional thing for you to do there?
[56:18.450 --> 56:20.210]  I guess I don't know what you're talking about.
[56:20.290 --> 56:22.110]  Is this what caused you to get the shit ending, Andrew?
[56:23.010 --> 56:26.150]  No, it isn't, but there is a...
[56:26.150 --> 56:28.410]  Is it listed as an optional objective?
[56:28.910 --> 56:29.870]  No, I don't think so.
[56:30.170 --> 56:32.130]  This is something I had no awareness of.
[56:32.310 --> 56:36.770]  It is a, I would say personally, I think it's a big kind of story thing that can happen.
[56:36.950 --> 56:40.370]  And I had no idea that it was a choice and that I had missed the choice.
[56:40.870 --> 56:43.110]  It was shocking to learn hours later.
[56:43.330 --> 56:46.090]  I don't want to spoil it for Gavin, but there's a,
[56:46.090 --> 56:52.010]  there's an optional thing that I guess I'm assuming you're past that and you didn't do.
[56:52.770 --> 56:53.130]  I guess so.
[56:53.190 --> 56:54.650]  I'm at like meet Hanako at Embers.
[56:54.890 --> 56:56.170]  It just tells me that all the time.
[56:56.950 --> 56:57.350]  Okay.
[56:57.450 --> 56:59.630]  I think that might be after what I'm talking about.
[56:59.710 --> 57:00.070]  It is.
[57:00.110 --> 57:01.610]  It's like the last mission before you beat the game.
[57:02.030 --> 57:02.290]  Okay.
[57:02.490 --> 57:02.890]  Then yeah.
[57:03.610 --> 57:04.310]  Do you care, Gavin?
[57:04.690 --> 57:05.610]  If I mention this?
[57:05.650 --> 57:06.730]  Well, I could take my headphones off.
[57:06.850 --> 57:07.450]  When shall I turn it on?
[57:07.450 --> 57:08.090]  All right.
[57:09.190 --> 57:11.290]  Put it in the Discord and I can watch again.
[57:11.950 --> 57:12.170]  Sure.
[57:12.370 --> 57:13.610]  It'll be really brief.
[57:14.230 --> 57:16.690]  What's the, your buddy that you do the parade thing with?
[57:17.050 --> 57:17.330]  That guy?
[57:17.610 --> 57:18.090]  The, the...
[57:19.610 --> 57:19.930]  Takamura?
[57:20.730 --> 57:20.910]  Yeah.
[57:21.210 --> 57:21.830]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[57:22.030 --> 57:22.770]  Something like that?
[57:23.270 --> 57:23.390]  Yeah.
[57:23.510 --> 57:25.890]  He dies in that sequence if you don't save him.
[57:25.990 --> 57:26.670]  Did you know that?
[57:26.990 --> 57:28.190]  Did you realize you had to save?
[57:28.270 --> 57:29.050]  I had no idea.
[57:29.190 --> 57:30.110]  I didn't know that was a thing.
[57:30.430 --> 57:30.810]  I didn't know he died.
[57:30.810 --> 57:31.930]  No, I thought he was just supposed to die.
[57:32.430 --> 57:33.350]  No, you can save him.
[57:33.510 --> 57:34.190]  You can go get him.
[57:34.810 --> 57:36.170]  You have to go pull him out.
[57:36.810 --> 57:37.150]  Are you serious?
[57:37.150 --> 57:37.930]  You have to like walk over.
[57:38.010 --> 57:38.130]  Yeah.
[57:38.150 --> 57:40.930]  You can walk over and like pull him out and save him and you're good.
[57:41.090 --> 57:42.710]  I didn't realize I had to do that.
[57:42.710 --> 57:44.210]  And I didn't know he died.
[57:44.530 --> 57:46.650]  It took me hours and someone having to tell me.
[57:46.970 --> 57:50.810]  I knew he died because I think they mentioned like he didn't make it or something.
[57:51.190 --> 57:55.030]  But I had no idea it was even possible to save him.
[57:55.310 --> 57:57.010]  Yeah. You could have just walked over and pulled him up.
[57:57.110 --> 57:58.490]  He was like stuck under some rubble.
[57:58.670 --> 57:59.710]  Missions and shit after that?
[57:59.950 --> 58:00.950]  I don't think so.
[58:01.030 --> 58:02.990]  I think it's just more like a narrative thing.
[58:03.050 --> 58:06.570]  Like he'll talk to you in a way, but it's not like a substantial...
[58:06.570 --> 58:10.710]  From my understanding, it wasn't a substantial thing to lose that character after that point.
[58:10.710 --> 58:12.990]  Okay, I said I told Gavin it was good.
[58:13.150 --> 58:13.270]  Yeah.
[58:13.330 --> 58:13.910]  All right, I'm back.
[58:14.550 --> 58:15.730]  All right, sorry about that.
[58:16.270 --> 58:19.730]  Yeah, he was just telling me he was just telling me a spoiler about Cyberpunk.
[58:19.950 --> 58:20.090]  Okay.
[58:20.650 --> 58:21.950]  About this specific character.
[58:22.570 --> 58:23.670]  I can tell you his name if you want.
[58:23.890 --> 58:26.590]  And then I can tell you the spoiler if you want.
[58:26.630 --> 58:27.910]  But what else did you say?
[58:28.590 --> 58:29.450]  Say some other shit?
[58:29.730 --> 58:30.810]  No, we just talked about the spoiler.
[58:31.030 --> 58:31.570]  Just Cyberpunk.
[58:31.710 --> 58:32.790]  What would you think we talked about?
[58:33.330 --> 58:33.650]  Me?
[58:34.110 --> 58:35.130]  Why would we talk about you?
[58:35.350 --> 58:37.170]  Wait, how many knives are in my back?
[58:37.270 --> 58:37.530]  Hold on.
[58:37.610 --> 58:39.530]  Why would you think we would be talking about?
[58:39.550 --> 58:40.630]  Let me let me look in my bag.
[58:40.630 --> 58:42.550]  Hold on a second while you're looking at your back.
[58:42.690 --> 58:44.650]  Why don't you why don't you leave the chat?
[58:45.030 --> 58:47.290]  I'm gonna I'm gonna tell Andrew another spoiler real fast.
[58:47.370 --> 58:49.470]  I don't like this thing we've started.
[58:49.850 --> 58:51.230]  I'll slack you as soon as I know.
[58:51.310 --> 58:53.090]  It's another spoiler related to the spoiler he told me.
[58:53.330 --> 58:58.890]  It's actually this is a really funny coincidence that this this whole like bit is happening right
[58:58.890 --> 59:04.550]  now because unlike Gavin, who's been stabbing knives in my back all the time, I'm a really
[59:04.550 --> 59:05.150]  good friend.
[59:05.210 --> 59:10.390]  And Geoff, you discussed recently on an episode that you have a problem that you are down
[59:10.390 --> 59:11.070]  a shitter.
[59:11.590 --> 59:12.790]  You've lost a shitter.
[59:13.370 --> 59:14.350]  Don't have a bath.
[59:14.430 --> 59:15.910]  Your toilet is out of commission.
[59:16.890 --> 59:22.630]  So I, as the good friend that I am, has solved this problem for you.
[59:22.910 --> 59:24.970]  It is outside your front door.
[59:25.430 --> 59:26.670]  You want to go check it out?
[59:27.870 --> 59:28.550]  No, it's not.
[59:29.050 --> 59:29.490]  It is.
[59:30.090 --> 59:31.150]  I'll be right back.
[59:33.030 --> 59:34.330]  Is today the day?
[59:34.810 --> 59:35.850]  Today's the day.
[59:36.070 --> 59:37.330]  I can't believe it.
[59:38.830 --> 59:39.790]  Oh, no, really?
[59:40.170 --> 59:40.450]  Really?
[59:40.890 --> 59:41.130]  Yeah.
[59:44.030 --> 59:44.470]  Yeah.
[59:44.530 --> 59:47.310]  Wait, didn't you know it was expensive?
[59:47.930 --> 59:48.370]  No.
[59:48.950 --> 59:50.070]  Oh, I thought it was.
[59:50.450 --> 59:52.150]  There was nothing on my front porch, by the way.
[59:52.150 --> 59:52.450]  Thank you.
[59:53.450 --> 59:54.230]  That's not good.
[59:54.670 --> 59:55.870]  Wait, it's not there.
[59:56.610 --> 59:59.570]  No, no.
[59:59.670 --> 01:00:00.330]  I'll go look at it.
[01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.910]  Hold on.
[01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.050]  Do you think he just looked on the doorstep?
[01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.070]  What it's like?
[01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.270]  I hope it's there.
[01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.190]  If it's not there, nobody say anything.
[01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:11.510]  I got to make some calls.
[01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.670]  Wait, when we came back, you didn't see it?
[01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:17.830]  No, it's not.
[01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:19.330]  It's not a subtle object whatsoever.
[01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:21.550]  This was the what color thing, right?
[01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:25.130]  Did you send it to the wrong house?
[01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:27.650]  Did you send it to one of my old houses?
[01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:29.410]  I'm gonna have to call some people.
[01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.990]  We're at like an hour.
[01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.450]  We're going to have an early episode.
[01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:36.750]  We should wrap up, guys, right?
[01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.510]  We should wrap up.
[01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:38.750]  I have to make some calls.
[01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.610]  How is it not out there?
[01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:44.370]  That's a great question, Gavin.
[01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:45.970]  That's a great question.
[01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:47.450]  Hold on.
[01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:49.950]  Maybe it would have been in the street.
[01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:54.570]  I mean, you would have immediately opened your door and seen it and then yelled,
[01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:55.790]  what the fuck?
[01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.670]  And we would have heard you on the microphone.
[01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.470]  Why don't you go out and have a real look around?
[01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:01.390]  So I'm going to go out.
[01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.230]  Or is this the joke?
[01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:05.890]  And the joke is to get me to take my headphones off.
[01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:08.170]  No, there's no.
[01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:09.850]  No, it's yeah.
[01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:14.530]  I would like to wrap this up so I can make some calls because we're at an hour.
[01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:16.210]  Then we won't get a reaction.
[01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:20.170]  Yeah, but it doesn't sound like there's a thing for him to react to at the moment.
[01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:25.350]  Get ready for the 2025 Pepsi National Battle of the Bands.
[01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.370]  Saturday, August 23rd at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.
[01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:30.710]  Come see the top HBCU marching bands in the country.
[01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.570]  Battle it out on the field and in the stands.
[01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:35.450]  Featuring national talent, a fan experience and a college fan.
[01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.550]  Supporting HBCUs with over 1.7 million in scholarships.
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.270]  Tickets start at $25 off the Pepsi National Battle of the Bands.
[01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:43.430]  Also sponsored by Walmart and JPMorgan Chase.

[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:49.870]  Um, Gavin?
[01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:54.110]  Yeah, but if we end it and then he's like, oh, there it is.
[01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.290]  I see your point.
[01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.970]  No, I don't.
[01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.950]  I think he would have seen it if it was there.
[01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.150]  I'm gonna make, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, for the sake of comedy.
[01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:06.330]  Even though I may be getting played.
[01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.130]  I'm gonna take one more look.
[01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:09.650]  Were you sitting there the whole time to see if we talk shit?
[01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:11.990]  I think he was there the whole time.
[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.210]  Yeah, I think, I think that was a test.
[01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.430]  No, I'm still not sure if you guys are fucking with me or not.
[01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:18.430]  I'm gonna go look one more time.
[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:21.510]  There's, there's no way you haven't seen it if it's there.
[01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:22.310]  I gotta call.
[01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:23.770]  I gotta make so many calls.
[01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:26.050]  If it's not there, it's not there.
[01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:27.850]  No, it's not.
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:28.790]  It's not there.
[01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.510]  If it is not there, it is not there.
[01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:32.030]  Get them to send you a picture of where it is.
[01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:33.270]  Will they do that?
[01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:34.430]  Is that something they do?
[01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:36.450]  I gotta make some calls.
[01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:38.270]  I gotta make, I don't know.
[01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.430]  I need to call some people.
[01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.050]  I think usually people can see them when they...
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.170]  Let's wrap it up.
[01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.910]  We have to wait for Geoff to come back so we can wrap it up.
[01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.090]  He's, he's doing a lap around his house.
[01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:48.710]  Andrew, do the outro.
[01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:52.030]  Well, I gotta, I mean, we've got to wait for Geoff to come back.
[01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:52.930]  This is funny.
[01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:54.290]  This is...
[01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:54.950]  That's not good.
[01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:59.630]  The only thing that's in my front yard that wasn't, that's not supposed to be there
[01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:02.590]  is all of the dirt and mud that used to be under my house.
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.530]  Where they dug a giant fucking tunnel.
[01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.190]  Could you do an outro, please, Geoff?
[01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:07.870]  What did I miss while I was gone?
[01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:10.590]  It was mostly Andrew saying, we need to wrap this up.
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:11.990]  I need to make some calls.
[01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.830]  It was mostly that the entire time you were gone.
[01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.130]  Do you, uh, here's what I'm going to guess.
[01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:20.390]  I'm going to guess Andrew thought he ordered a port-a-potty to my house.
[01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:22.930]  I'm not, I'm not saying anything.
[01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.950]  And I'm going to guess it wasn't delivered.
[01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:25.890]  I'm not saying anything.
[01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:29.530]  I hope you didn't send a port-a-potty to somebody else's house.
[01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:30.830]  I'm not saying anything.
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.610]  I gotta make some calls.
[01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:37.390]  Let's wrap this up, Geoff.
[01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:39.990]  Okay, let's end the episode.
[01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:42.890]  I think we covered everything I wanted to talk about.
[01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.870]  Uh, basketball cards are getting real dark for me.
[01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:46.830]  I need to get out of that.
[01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.470]  Uh, it's starting to destroy me.
[01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:50.650]  And, uh, Gavin, you got anything else?
[01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.390]  No, just the outro that you're about to do.
[01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:54.550]  Okay, Andrew, you want anything else you want to cover?
[01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:55.890]  Any more knives in your back or anything?
[01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:59.150]  Yeah.
[01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:05.970]  All right, well, uh, thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.210]  I believe this was the 36th episode.
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:12.150]  And gosh, if you're hearing me say this right now, that means you listened to the whole episode.
[01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:13.670]  And we sure appreciate that.
[01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:20.610]  It's your support that allows us to continue and to, uh, to help grow our little friendship
[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:21.670]  through this podcast.
[01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:26.130]  And I just, I know I'm speaking for the other guys here, but I just want to say,
[01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:28.370]  we really, really do appreciate your support.
[01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.230]  We love you so much.
[01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:33.130]  And if it weren't for you listening to it, we wouldn't be able, wouldn't be able to do this.
[01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:36.450]  And, uh, wouldn't be able to afford things like porta-potties to send to people's houses,
[01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.930]  I'm assuming.
[01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:41.630]  Uh, so, uh, take that love and like or energy or whatever, if you liked it,
[01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:42.950]  and, uh, tell somebody about it.
[01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.550]  Tell a friend.
[01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.490]  See if you can get somebody else to subscribe to our podcast.
[01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:48.650]  You mentioned how many stars they should leave, Geoff.
[01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:49.690]  I will. I'll get there.
[01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:52.990]  Give a, you know, convince somebody to listen to an episode or two.
[01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.950]  Maybe your favorite one out of the 36.
[01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.710]  A lot of people like episode 16.
[01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.690]  I know that was a particularly, uh, popular, uh, one.
[01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:02.830]  And, uh, you know, tell a friend.
[01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.410]  Tell a family member, uh, if you like, uh, the show a lot,
[01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:08.790]  you could support us by buying a t-shirt or a fuck hat.
[01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:12.230]  I'm wearing one of the, one of the Russian fuck hats now, these days.
[01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:12.970]  I got one in the mail.
[01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.510]  And, uh, I didn't think that it would fit my head well.
[01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.550]  But I'm surprised to say, Gavin and Andrew, it does really well.
[01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:21.270]  It's, uh, it's actually become my favorite hat.
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:23.670]  Yeah, it has replaced my Geoff hat that I used to wear.
[01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.510]  Uh, so my, the Russian fuck hat's my number one hat.
[01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.170]  And I have gotten some compliments on it.
[01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:33.910]  Oh, and I meant to tell you that Marcus, Marcus Andrew, I did a photoshoot, uh, today.
[01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.070]  And Marcus was there, Marcus Laporte.
[01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:39.630]  And he told me to tell you thank you for the incredibly kind stuff you tweeted to him.
[01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:41.370]  When he mentioned the fuck hat.
[01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:41.630]  Great.
[01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.770]  He really appreciated that.
[01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.950]  Also, go ahead and give us five stars.
[01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.490]  Leave a review on Apple Podcast.
[01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:51.450]  And, uh, we'll see you next week here for episode 37 of F*** Face.
[01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:55.030]  Starring Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free, and Andrew Pant.
[01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.670]  Produced by, uh, Eric Baudour.
[01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:02.190]  And, uh, I have no idea who's editing it right now because I believe Nick is on paternity leave.
[01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:04.270]  But, uh, thank you.
[01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:06.550]  And we'll see you next week.
[01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:07.190]  Bye-bye.
