[00:30.840 --> 00:33.520]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:46.280 --> 00:52.020]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of F*** Face. We just flew into Vancouver Island.
[00:52.260 --> 00:58.620]  Eric and Gavin and Geoff and I were pulled up in Andrew's sort of apartment next to the apartment
[00:58.620 --> 01:03.940]  complex. It's a pile of just rubble. And my building was on fire.
[01:04.120 --> 01:05.380]  Did you say Geoff and I?
[01:05.840 --> 01:10.520]  What? I don't know. This might be... was it Roadman or whatever? I think
[01:10.520 --> 01:11.760]  if he did, I missed it.
[01:11.940 --> 01:15.120]  I'm pretty sure he said I'm here with Andrew and Geoff and I.
[01:15.360 --> 01:18.500]  Maybe. It's possible. Can't rule it out.
[01:19.700 --> 01:22.920]  What episode is this? Not actually from Vancouver.
[01:23.340 --> 01:24.280]  No. What episode is this?
[01:24.620 --> 01:29.160]  13... 39, right? Last one was 38. We did a vote. I betrayed Gavin. That was fun.
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.600]  This will be 39. Yeah.
[01:30.840 --> 01:31.040]  Yeah.
[01:31.200 --> 01:35.200]  I'm sitting uncomfortably because the knife is like rubbing against the back of my chair,
[01:35.260 --> 01:36.160]  and I've got to lean forwards.
[01:36.840 --> 01:39.900]  It does suck, doesn't it? If it makes you feel any better, Gavin,
[01:39.900 --> 01:45.300]  I made that alliance with him before the podcast, and I didn't trust it for one second.
[01:45.560 --> 01:48.300]  I mean, I don't doubt that, but I also made the alliance.
[01:48.920 --> 01:53.320]  I know! I was really expecting you two to text each other about it at some point or
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.360]  some form of communication.
[01:54.680 --> 01:59.620]  Look, I'm so scared at all times of destroying the bit. I just go along with it at this point.
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.960]  I don't know who I'm going to be screwing over if I let someone else know about your
[02:03.420 --> 02:07.760]  games. And all that did is closed my eyes to the knife that was flying at me.
[02:07.760 --> 02:12.480]  It was fun to text you both word for word the same things back and forth.
[02:12.580 --> 02:17.600]  It feels like in this relationship that we all share, this friendship,
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.240]  and I'll include Eric in this now too, it feels like there's not a safe place ever.
[02:23.800 --> 02:27.920]  There's no safe move. There's no place that's safe to talk. Everything is fodder.
[02:28.420 --> 02:31.940]  Everything is open for a bit, and everything is probably a bit.
[02:32.420 --> 02:35.160]  I don't trust any genuine moment anymore.
[02:35.820 --> 02:39.020]  This is the worst thing that's happened to my friendship with you two.
[02:39.200 --> 02:39.340]  Three.
[02:39.760 --> 02:47.580]  The paranoia on this show is like unmatched on anything I've ever, I mean, I've ever worked on.
[02:47.840 --> 02:54.700]  Ever. It is, there is constantly scheming on top of scheming behind other schemes,
[02:55.060 --> 02:59.040]  and you can't trust simple questions. It's like, it's really incredible.
[02:59.340 --> 03:03.160]  It must be what it was like to be on the set filming like Jackass 2 or 3.
[03:03.480 --> 03:03.680]  Yep.
[03:05.160 --> 03:08.600]  You don't know whether your head's gonna get shaved or shit smeared in your eye or something.
[03:08.660 --> 03:10.780]  It's like, hey Gav, come here for a second. No.
[03:11.180 --> 03:12.320]  Go over there for a second. No.
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.680]  Do you want to eat? No.
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.140]  Do you need to go to the bathroom? No.
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.200]  Do you want to take a nap? No.
[03:16.280 --> 03:17.160]  Do you want to sit? No.
[03:17.420 --> 03:18.520]  Do you want to stand? No.
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.680]  Yeah, it's like, no, I'm not gonna go over there.
[03:21.480 --> 03:22.720]  I'm gonna stay right here.
[03:22.960 --> 03:24.140]  On this snake, oh!
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.680]  I will say...
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.620]  I sent you a text, Andrew.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.480]  Yeah, I saw, I was laughing at it.
[03:32.480 --> 03:34.920]  Why am I... no, no, I think I'm...
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.400]  You guys are conspiring!
[03:37.760 --> 03:38.960]  No, it was a great text.
[03:39.880 --> 03:41.620]  I feel like we should bring up for...
[03:41.620 --> 03:44.340]  because the episode that just aired was the one where I was like,
[03:44.400 --> 03:46.660]  I need to call somebody because I'm sending something to Geoff.
[03:46.940 --> 03:50.440]  The amount of people that think I actually bought a port-a-potty is absurd.
[03:50.960 --> 03:53.440]  Well, it's entirely like you.
[03:53.580 --> 03:54.460]  You convinced me.
[03:54.680 --> 03:55.460]  I was convinced.
[03:55.780 --> 04:01.040]  The amount of people on this podcast that believed you actually bought a port-a-potty is 100%.
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.260]  Yeah, the people who know you the most in place thought you'd done it.
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.760]  So the people who don't know you, you're surprised they thought you did it?
[04:09.360 --> 04:13.520]  Yeah, well, I guess, I don't know, there's like a certain level to that that's so extreme
[04:13.520 --> 04:16.340]  that I was like, wow, I can't believe everyone was like...
[04:17.020 --> 04:19.620]  I mean, I did, I sent... Gavin knows what I sent.
[04:19.700 --> 04:21.860]  I did send you something that'll arrive on Monday, Geoff.
[04:22.080 --> 04:25.160]  And I feel like we'll pay off a little bit on this whole port-a-potty thing.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.420]  You got that to enjoy.
[04:26.940 --> 04:28.860]  It's not an inconvenience, would you say, Gavin?
[04:29.300 --> 04:30.000]  I can't hear you.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.840]  The knife is blocking sound waves, I guess, through my headphones.
[04:33.080 --> 04:34.280]  Oh, OK. No, fair enough.
[04:34.500 --> 04:35.080]  Fair enough.
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.780]  I feel like I handled it like an adult when you betrayed me twice.
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.900]  Oh, yeah, I guess I'm sulking too much.
[04:42.100 --> 04:42.920]  I've only got one knife.
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.700]  By the way, we seem to have never addressed the salad cream.
[04:51.080 --> 04:54.460]  Oh, I've had a fucking salad on my desk for the entire episode.
[04:54.460 --> 05:00.340]  We just sat there looking at a salad.
[05:00.440 --> 05:02.580]  Yeah, no, I've just been staring at it.
[05:02.740 --> 05:06.200]  I just, I just like to point out when things like that happen,
[05:06.280 --> 05:12.800]  and it's a 14 minute change for us, people are waiting weeks for this bit to pay off.
[05:13.200 --> 05:13.680]  Weeks.
[05:14.280 --> 05:17.420]  We need, we need like a big board kind of like,
[05:17.480 --> 05:20.900]  like they have in Family Feud that shows like the ranked shit.
[05:21.040 --> 05:23.760]  That's just like stuff we have to address per episode.
[05:23.760 --> 05:27.000]  And we should just go down because we forget so much important stuff.
[05:27.380 --> 05:29.460]  That is a great point. I still need to make a basket.
[05:29.820 --> 05:32.620]  That's been on my list for episode one.
[05:32.960 --> 05:34.440]  Yeah, it's like episode six.
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.880]  Last episode, we agreed that we were going to pick a card and announce it on Instagram,
[05:39.180 --> 05:41.340]  which by this point we must have done.
[05:41.500 --> 05:44.720]  But because we just went straight from that episode to this one,
[05:44.820 --> 05:47.540]  we don't know. Like we're still in the past.
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.120]  That's why I was super against the cliffhanger ending,
[05:50.120 --> 05:53.920]  because there's no guarantee we would have even revealed the vote result in this one,
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.800]  because we could have been sidetracked with salad.
[05:56.080 --> 05:56.580]  Who knows?
[05:56.940 --> 05:57.940]  That's a hell of a cliffhanger.
[06:01.740 --> 06:05.220]  So I like the idea of Andrew's had this salad on his desk
[06:05.220 --> 06:08.540]  and was definitely not going to bring up the salad cream himself.
[06:08.760 --> 06:11.560]  I think you would have happily sat there for two recordings
[06:11.560 --> 06:14.200]  and never mentioned the salad if you could have.
[06:14.620 --> 06:18.700]  No, I was, I planned on, because we agreed I'd do it next episode,
[06:19.440 --> 06:21.000]  two episodes ago at this point.
[06:21.580 --> 06:24.700]  And we were at like 40 minutes and Geoff's like, well, we got two things.
[06:24.720 --> 06:27.800]  We got to deal with the Zimmer situation and we got to do this vote.
[06:27.960 --> 06:30.500]  And I was like, well, I guess I'm just not doing salad. We'll do it next one.
[06:30.620 --> 06:33.280]  You should have interjected on benefit of salad.
[06:33.400 --> 06:35.780]  Well, you know, end of show this one.
[06:35.900 --> 06:39.140]  I got the salad ready. I got the salad cream. I got everything good to go.
[06:39.300 --> 06:41.560]  You can play us out with a salad. I like it.
[06:41.720 --> 06:44.100]  I can play us out with a salad.
[06:44.240 --> 06:46.020]  We'll eat it live. I love it.
[06:46.020 --> 06:51.240]  I like that you sniffed the salad cream two weeks ago and you're going to eat it today.
[06:52.140 --> 06:52.500]  Yeah.
[06:53.220 --> 06:55.380]  Oh, Eric wants to start with the card vote.
[06:55.660 --> 06:57.680]  No, there's no more card vote. We did the card vote.
[06:57.880 --> 06:59.340]  Did we? Well, no, we're not doing a card vote.
[06:59.520 --> 07:00.440]  Oh, the card game.
[07:00.600 --> 07:02.740]  We got to, we got to figure out who does 99 versus one.
[07:02.900 --> 07:03.800]  The number wang.
[07:03.900 --> 07:07.080]  Yeah, but that's not a vote. I don't think Eric knows his role.
[07:07.200 --> 07:09.380]  And Eric, you have to pick a number between one and 25.
[07:09.620 --> 07:11.680]  Okay. Do you want to explain it to Eric and the audience real fast?
[07:11.680 --> 07:16.100]  Okay. Yeah. So to determine who only has to sign one thing,
[07:16.740 --> 07:19.320]  Eric is going to pick a number in his head between one and 25.
[07:19.840 --> 07:23.040]  Geoff and I will go back and forth trying to guess what that number is.
[07:23.360 --> 07:26.840]  Whoever gets it right first wins and only has to sign one thing.
[07:27.320 --> 07:28.240]  Loser has to sign 99.
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.020]  Okay. Do I need to, should I like tell Gavin what the number is?
[07:31.040 --> 07:32.460]  So that way nobody thinks I'm tricking anyone?
[07:32.700 --> 07:34.200]  Yeah. Yeah. That's a great idea.
[07:34.300 --> 07:35.000]  That is a great idea.
[07:35.100 --> 07:37.080]  Gavin, do you want me to like message you on here?
[07:37.120 --> 07:38.400]  Or like, what do you want me to do?
[07:38.580 --> 07:39.280]  Why don't you call me?
[07:39.400 --> 07:40.460]  I don't have your number.
[07:43.320 --> 07:44.900]  Okay. Why don't they both deafen?
[07:45.100 --> 07:46.780]  Yeah. You both deafen and I'll say come back.
[07:46.860 --> 07:47.480]  Okay. Okay.
[07:47.840 --> 07:52.200]  Yeah. I was trying to, I had to tell Geoff to like contact you for me the other day
[07:52.200 --> 07:54.560]  because I don't have your number. So I don't like it. What was I going to do?
[07:54.700 --> 07:56.040]  Do you want it? I'll give it to you after this.
[07:56.060 --> 07:57.340]  Yeah. Yeah. After this. Yeah. Yeah. Just in case.
[07:57.380 --> 07:59.640]  Cause if there needs to be more schemes, you know what I mean?
[08:00.080 --> 08:00.580]  Uh, yeah.
[08:00.660 --> 08:01.820]  Anyway, the number is six.
[08:01.960 --> 08:03.860]  Okay. Lower than I thought it'd be.
[08:03.920 --> 08:04.680]  Yeah. Me too.
[08:04.760 --> 08:07.360]  That's a very interesting pick. Okay. Yep. Yep.
[08:07.540 --> 08:09.380]  Geoff can't figure out how to undeafen.
[08:10.380 --> 08:11.320]  Geoff can't figure it out.
[08:11.320 --> 08:12.780]  Can I pick first? Cause I'm here first.
[08:12.780 --> 08:15.140]  Uh, no. We have to wait for Geoff. Oh, okay. Did you figure it out?
[08:15.300 --> 08:16.180]  Did you figure out how to undeafen?
[08:16.540 --> 08:18.020]  Yeah. No, I was dealing with the fucking dog.
[08:20.460 --> 08:22.200]  Were you calling it by my name?
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.460]  Yeah. Little Eric got his ball stuck under the coffee table. So I had to get it out.
[08:29.320 --> 08:33.680]  It's his owl. It's his favorite toy. And so we call it Owl Owl.
[08:33.740 --> 08:35.420]  And he gets mad if he can't get to it. So.
[08:35.720 --> 08:36.800]  Okay. It's okay little buddy.
[08:37.060 --> 08:39.260]  I call him, I call him a little mini 64.
[08:39.260 --> 08:43.400]  Oh, that's fun. That's very fun. Uh, okay. Who gets to go first?
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.860]  Uh, you can go first if you want, Geoff.
[08:46.660 --> 08:50.240]  Okay. So I need to guess a number between one and 25.
[08:50.520 --> 08:51.380]  That's right. One and 25.
[08:52.600 --> 08:55.420]  Okay. Uh, I'm going to guess the number...
[08:59.380 --> 09:00.460]  Two. No.
[09:01.280 --> 09:02.260]  25. No.
[09:02.460 --> 09:03.140]  Three. No.
[09:03.660 --> 09:05.020]  Six. What was that?
[09:05.380 --> 09:07.620]  Six. I can't hear. Can you hear what he's saying?
[09:07.820 --> 09:09.380]  What did you say? Six.
[09:09.380 --> 09:10.960]  Are you saying six?
[09:11.360 --> 09:14.560]  Why don't you say a long noise and then end with the number?
[09:14.880 --> 09:15.520]  Yeah. What?
[09:15.820 --> 09:17.860]  Just go like, uh, six.
[09:18.020 --> 09:20.680]  Okay. I think I'm going to pick six.
[09:20.840 --> 09:21.780]  Yeah. Six is the number.
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.580]  Really? Yeah. Six is the number.
[09:23.680 --> 09:27.080]  That's why I was asking you to play it again because you kept cutting out and we weren't sure,
[09:27.220 --> 09:30.060]  but that is the number. For us, we just heard like, six.
[09:30.320 --> 09:31.040]  This is fantastic.
[09:31.320 --> 09:33.360]  I thought maybe there was a chance you were saying 26,
[09:33.760 --> 09:35.360]  even though the number was one to 25.
[09:35.780 --> 09:36.600]  No. Yeah.
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.520]  No. Was there a reason for picking six? Because I had a strategy.
[09:40.900 --> 09:42.200]  No. A strategy?
[09:42.640 --> 09:46.540]  Yeah. I just Googled what Don Zimmer's number was and he was 66.
[09:48.700 --> 09:51.920]  Don Zimmer was 66, so I was like, I'll just go with a six.
[09:52.420 --> 09:55.220]  You just picked six just because there's no Zimmer connection?
[09:55.340 --> 09:56.520]  No. That's fucking great.
[09:56.780 --> 10:00.220]  Thanks, Zim. I was living the Zen of Zim life.
[10:00.260 --> 10:03.880]  I was in the Zimmer zone and I only need to sign one card.
[10:03.880 --> 10:06.900]  That is two men meeting head-to-head in the Zim zone.
[10:07.420 --> 10:12.460]  I feel like that was lucky because Geoff was just slowly heading towards six with his guess.
[10:12.680 --> 10:14.320]  You had to nip him in the bud and you did.
[10:14.540 --> 10:15.260]  That's fantastic.
[10:15.460 --> 10:19.860]  Andrew, congratulations. You're the Black Onyx Parable or whatever.
[10:19.980 --> 10:22.820]  Great. So we're mailing one card to Canada?
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.860]  Yeah. I'll do 99, you do 300, and then Andrew will do one.
[10:28.220 --> 10:31.560]  And the funny part is a hundred of your 200 won't go to anybody.
[10:32.320 --> 10:33.160]  Of your 300.
[10:33.160 --> 10:35.420]  I think this went really well.
[10:36.420 --> 10:38.940]  Yeah, you came out on top, I guess.
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.800]  What a surprise that Andrew had the idea and Andrew managed to come out on top
[10:44.740 --> 10:46.140]  through manipulating the system.
[10:46.880 --> 10:52.740]  What a surprise that Andrew Hedge Fund Penton managed to come out on top and beat the little guy.
[10:53.240 --> 10:55.820]  I am the absolute little guy. Get out of here.
[10:55.860 --> 10:59.400]  I'm always against you doing burger bets because I know you won't be able to do it
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.260]  and you'll just lose more money or eat more pencils.
[11:01.820 --> 11:03.940]  And I sort of try and talk you out of them every time.
[11:04.020 --> 11:07.300]  But if you want to try it again, I'm open for it.
[11:08.320 --> 11:10.060]  My burger days are behind me.
[11:10.180 --> 11:13.740]  What about your confidence? What about your confidence and go confidence?
[11:14.160 --> 11:17.980]  Yeah, it's just the burger confidence is gone. I'll have that in other areas.
[11:18.200 --> 11:21.380]  I've retired from burgers. I just don't. It's a young man's game.
[11:21.480 --> 11:24.400]  We've heard this before. We've heard these exact same words.
[11:25.240 --> 11:26.700]  I'm telling you, this is different.
[11:27.100 --> 11:27.760]  It's not different.
[11:27.940 --> 11:30.980]  I tried. No, it is. It is. The last one.
[11:31.260 --> 11:34.420]  I think my favorite comment about the whole burger controversy,
[11:34.500 --> 11:36.540]  me trying to explain it, and I felt like it missed the point,
[11:36.620 --> 11:37.500]  but it was just really funny.
[11:37.880 --> 11:39.040]  But somebody said something like,
[11:39.320 --> 11:42.820]  wait, so are you telling me this guy accidentally added 10 slices of cheese
[11:42.820 --> 11:45.540]  and then just tried to find a way where he can't lose because of that?
[11:45.780 --> 11:47.140]  Is this the most simple breakdown?
[11:47.580 --> 11:49.720]  I was like, I kind of did that, but that wasn't the point.
[11:50.080 --> 11:51.160]  I just wanted clarification.
[11:51.500 --> 11:53.920]  I would have been fine with it failing and it being an official fail.
[11:54.260 --> 11:55.060]  I was just looking for clarity.
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.180]  Neither of us ever specified which burgers you have to eat.
[11:59.280 --> 12:00.560]  It was all you. We can't go down this road.
[12:00.560 --> 12:01.780]  You changed it.
[12:01.880 --> 12:03.640]  I don't know why you stopped eating burgers.
[12:03.840 --> 12:04.920]  That's all I'll say about it.
[12:05.020 --> 12:05.900]  I just wanted clarification.
[12:06.680 --> 12:07.900]  I can't believe I won.
[12:08.460 --> 12:08.960]  That went great.
[12:09.240 --> 12:10.100]  Can we talk about something?
[12:10.260 --> 12:13.020]  You know what I feel really shitty about that we should have talked about?
[12:13.260 --> 12:13.940]  Same session.
[12:14.240 --> 12:16.240]  So it doesn't it's just we're a few weeks in the future now.
[12:16.900 --> 12:20.200]  That fucking VR game that the person in the community made.
[12:20.380 --> 12:21.220]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[12:21.860 --> 12:22.260]  Ridiculous.
[12:22.620 --> 12:24.400]  That's so awesome that they made that.
[12:24.500 --> 12:27.440]  I believe their username was Lord Beardsteak.
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.160]  I like the pillow stacking part.
[12:29.880 --> 12:31.640]  Pillow stacking was great.
[12:32.200 --> 12:37.000]  Actually, Gavin, that was my main pitch to Geoff and to get him to vote you out.
[12:37.380 --> 12:41.180]  I was talking to that guy and he brought up that you haven't had like a definitive
[12:41.180 --> 12:43.140]  fuck face yet for yourself.
[12:43.480 --> 12:44.480]  Now, like I have the pillows.
[12:45.060 --> 12:46.060]  Geoff has the toilet.
[12:46.140 --> 12:46.820]  I have the pencil.
[12:47.200 --> 12:49.260]  You haven't had your version of the pencil yet.
[12:49.300 --> 12:50.140]  I have socks.
[12:50.340 --> 12:51.120]  He has socks.
[12:51.320 --> 12:54.020]  I had a frickin mushroom growing out of my drain.
[12:54.100 --> 12:54.660]  That's true.
[12:54.760 --> 12:55.480]  That's a great point.
[12:55.540 --> 12:56.640]  What's going on with the mushroom?
[12:56.800 --> 12:58.280]  Yeah, we get a mushroom update.
[12:58.280 --> 12:59.460]  It hasn't come back yet.
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.760]  I've been deliberately using that sink a lot to prevent fungal growth.
[13:04.220 --> 13:04.980]  I'll be honest.
[13:05.120 --> 13:07.460]  A lot of people in the comments weren't that worried about it.
[13:07.580 --> 13:08.900]  They were like, oh, you know, it happened to me.
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.080]  Happens. Mushrooms.
[13:10.280 --> 13:13.040]  I've never seen that in my life in a sink.
[13:13.300 --> 13:17.280]  I was pretty disappointed by how not shocked people were.
[13:17.720 --> 13:20.420]  And there were people that were like plumbers that were like,
[13:20.480 --> 13:23.500]  happens all the time, especially if it's a rarely used sink.
[13:23.560 --> 13:24.260]  It's no big deal.
[13:24.260 --> 13:29.760]  I was hoping against hope that they were going to have to like weed kill your entire house.
[13:30.260 --> 13:32.900]  And it was going to they were going to have to put like the big
[13:32.900 --> 13:35.800]  red and white striped tent over your house for like a month.
[13:35.920 --> 13:38.060]  And you have to go live in a hotel and none of that.
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.500]  Because usually people on the Internet are absolute worry warts.
[13:41.660 --> 13:44.640]  They'll they'll feed you info that's like, oh, you're going to die or something.
[13:44.800 --> 13:47.420]  Or like your brain's coming out of your head because you have a dent now.
[13:47.540 --> 13:50.360]  Yeah, you're going to sneeze and brain will split it off.
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.040]  This was like, I don't worry about it.
[13:52.040 --> 13:53.520]  It's just just drain fungus.
[13:53.520 --> 13:54.640]  Good news for me.
[13:56.180 --> 13:57.560]  Is it really just that?
[13:57.680 --> 14:00.260]  That seems like a simplification of that problem.
[14:00.640 --> 14:04.280]  I would maybe burn down my entire house if I had mushrooms in my pipes.
[14:04.440 --> 14:05.620]  Well, I mean, I guess it makes sense.
[14:05.680 --> 14:06.680]  It's dark and damp.
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.340]  And if there's sitting water or just like dregs of water, I can see it happening.
[14:10.520 --> 14:10.960]  That's fair.
[14:11.340 --> 14:11.800]  I don't know.
[14:11.800 --> 14:14.580]  I just it would be like in my head that the last of us has started.
[14:14.700 --> 14:16.000]  This is where you've wave one.
[14:16.180 --> 14:19.600]  That's what I was thinking when I was looking at my carpet that one time.
[14:20.180 --> 14:21.460]  The last of us has begun.
[14:21.840 --> 14:22.020]  Yeah.
[14:22.020 --> 14:25.140]  It sucked to be patient zero in a zombie apocalypse.
[14:25.400 --> 14:28.040]  I think it'd be better than being further down the line.
[14:28.440 --> 14:28.980]  Less fear.
[14:29.280 --> 14:29.580]  Can I?
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.100]  This is a how do I set this up?
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.780]  One time I almost kicked a child in the chest.
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.240]  Why?
[14:42.600 --> 14:45.680]  Okay, well, I just moved.
[14:46.080 --> 14:46.880]  I just moved.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.780]  It was a new neighborhood and wasn't in like the greatest part of town.
[14:50.780 --> 14:52.580]  I mean, that doesn't even really justify this.
[14:53.020 --> 14:55.060]  So I was walking the first.
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.140]  Is the first time I had gone on a walk in this neighborhood and I was going around and I was
[15:03.140 --> 15:06.700]  thinking like, man, you ever have those thoughts like, man, what if somebody was following me?
[15:06.740 --> 15:07.340]  That'd be weird.
[15:07.380 --> 15:09.980]  And so I like I checked my shoulder every once in a while.
[15:10.120 --> 15:12.160]  I did it like maybe once, once or twice.
[15:12.160 --> 15:14.380]  And so I'm walking and I was like, should I listen to music?
[15:14.420 --> 15:14.960]  I don't know.
[15:15.080 --> 15:15.340]  It's new.
[15:15.480 --> 15:16.900]  I think I just I'll listen.
[15:16.980 --> 15:17.180]  Whatever.
[15:17.240 --> 15:17.940]  I'll listen to a podcast.
[15:17.940 --> 15:21.000]  So I'm walking and I'm like maybe three minutes from my house.
[15:21.040 --> 15:23.900]  And I had one of those thoughts like, man, wouldn't it be fucking crazy if somebody was
[15:23.900 --> 15:24.400]  following me?
[15:24.580 --> 15:29.780]  So I turned around and there was a black outline of a child and they were just standing still.
[15:29.900 --> 15:32.120]  They're like maybe a six year old boy, six or seven.
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.660]  And I looked at him and I said, hey, and the kid didn't say anything.
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.480]  And the way that the streetlights were hitting him, there was nothing but black.
[15:40.480 --> 15:43.080]  It was like literally a black outline of a person.
[15:43.500 --> 15:45.840]  And they just started slowly walking towards me.
[15:46.140 --> 15:47.600]  And I just kept saying, hey, what's up?
[15:47.600 --> 15:48.280]  How's it going?
[15:48.380 --> 15:48.840]  How's it going?
[15:48.900 --> 15:49.500]  Hey, how's it going?
[15:49.700 --> 15:53.060]  And I'm walking backwards, talking to this kid as he's walking forwards.
[15:53.220 --> 15:54.220]  And it was freaking me out.
[15:54.260 --> 15:55.100]  It was super creepy.
[15:55.280 --> 15:56.420]  I couldn't there's like no face.
[15:56.480 --> 15:56.800]  There's nothing.
[15:56.860 --> 15:58.360]  It's just a black outline of a person.
[15:58.740 --> 16:02.740]  And we got to the point if that kid would have taken like three more steps.
[16:02.740 --> 16:07.520]  I in my head was like, I'm kicking you in the chest because this is a zombie apocalypse.
[16:07.980 --> 16:10.120]  I'm not fucking zombie number six.
[16:10.320 --> 16:12.180]  We're making it through at least day one.
[16:12.620 --> 16:15.780]  So we're walking and then all of a sudden I hear a door open.
[16:15.780 --> 16:20.460]  And this like a normal mom just yelled like Peter, it's dinner.
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.500]  And then the kid just turned around and left.
[16:22.740 --> 16:24.220]  I was fucking terrified.
[16:24.420 --> 16:26.020]  He's just out there fronting on people.
[16:26.240 --> 16:26.480]  Yeah.
[16:26.700 --> 16:30.520]  I like the idea that in your brain, all logic had gone and you were thinking,
[16:30.900 --> 16:34.680]  well, I'm going to regret not kicking the kid if I end up being zombie number six.
[16:34.820 --> 16:35.260]  Absolutely.
[16:36.260 --> 16:38.240]  I felt like I'd given enough warnings.
[16:38.340 --> 16:39.720]  I was walking backwards.
[16:40.060 --> 16:43.300]  I felt like I was completely in my rights to kick this kid.
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.360]  How tall do you think he was?
[16:45.360 --> 16:47.060]  Oh, maybe four feet.
[16:47.200 --> 16:49.160]  He was very small.
[16:49.460 --> 16:50.520]  Do you have a hook on the age?
[16:50.600 --> 16:51.800]  Like any idea how old he was?
[16:52.120 --> 16:54.080]  I would say below the age of eight.
[16:54.160 --> 16:54.880]  How tall are you?
[16:55.120 --> 16:56.340]  I'm like five foot ten.
[16:56.540 --> 16:59.520]  So before this eight year old kid's mom called him in,
[16:59.600 --> 17:02.260]  he was about to beat the living shit out of you is what it sounds like.
[17:02.420 --> 17:03.460]  Nah, no, no.
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.460]  Because I was going to fucking kick him in the chest.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.920]  I'd work this out because if he is a zombie, I want some range.
[17:09.080 --> 17:10.800]  This is definitely a kicking situation.
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.340]  I was going as hard as I can to the chest and just running home.
[17:14.340 --> 17:16.560]  You're about to go this is panting on him.
[17:16.560 --> 17:17.580]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:17.780 --> 17:21.980]  I was going to go full this is panting, unload on his chest.
[17:22.240 --> 17:24.800]  I think, you know, at that point, no matter what I would have ran
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.420]  because it was just a kid and he probably would have cried
[17:27.420 --> 17:30.260]  and I would have felt awful and I'd run from the scene of the assault.
[17:30.740 --> 17:35.540]  I feel like any time you have to get into a fight with someone,
[17:35.700 --> 17:39.560]  you should yell ham zone at the top of your lungs before swinging.
[17:39.900 --> 17:43.220]  I don't think I'm glad that the mom called him because I don't know if
[17:43.220 --> 17:47.040]  saying I thought he was a zombie would hold up in defense of the act.
[17:47.740 --> 17:50.180]  See, like he caved in his chest. I thought he was a zombie.
[17:50.600 --> 17:51.420]  I went ham zone.
[17:51.720 --> 17:54.720]  I said hi multiple times and the kid did not respond.
[17:54.980 --> 17:56.940]  That was like a pivotal moment in your life.
[17:56.960 --> 17:58.420]  I think there's an alternate reality
[17:58.420 --> 18:02.580]  where you're in a completely different place and the split was your foot
[18:02.580 --> 18:04.660]  hit in the rib cage of that kid.
[18:04.720 --> 18:08.360]  Yeah, you got arrested and you're like, oh, I thought he was a zombie.
[18:08.480 --> 18:09.700]  The judge sends you down.
[18:11.020 --> 18:12.420]  Oh, the poor kid.
[18:12.420 --> 18:14.160]  What do you mean the poor kid? The poor kid.
[18:14.300 --> 18:15.000]  I don't, I mean...
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.360]  If you in a world where a five foot ten man kicks an eight year old kid as hard as he can in the chest.
[18:19.620 --> 18:20.640]  Yeah, the poor kid.
[18:20.740 --> 18:22.560]  I would never want to do that.
[18:22.900 --> 18:24.480]  I was not, you know, I thought he was a zombie.
[18:25.640 --> 18:27.940]  He's breathing out of a bag for the rest of his life.
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.360]  He can't, he doesn't walk anymore.
[18:29.860 --> 18:32.340]  Why can't the kid say hi or stop falling?
[18:32.400 --> 18:33.360]  It was very creepy.
[18:33.760 --> 18:36.800]  I think most people in my position would have been very concerned.
[18:36.940 --> 18:37.800]  Probably had headphones in.
[18:38.000 --> 18:38.600]  No, he didn't.
[18:38.680 --> 18:41.780]  He's probably listening to the Wiggles or Raffy or something going about his day.
[18:43.320 --> 18:45.900]  He's like, I love you, you love me.
[18:46.080 --> 18:47.260]  Sucking chest wound.
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.220]  I was, I was staring him down, even though I couldn't see his eyes.
[18:52.320 --> 18:54.680]  There was a stare down and I was yelling, hey, what's up?
[18:54.680 --> 18:55.780]  Were you making yourself big?
[18:55.860 --> 18:57.420]  Were you like swinging your arms out?
[18:57.620 --> 18:58.840]  Like up in the shoulders?
[18:59.060 --> 19:00.420]  No, no, no.
[19:00.480 --> 19:02.120]  I was more the every step back.
[19:02.140 --> 19:03.780]  I was like, is he going to keep moving forward?
[19:03.880 --> 19:04.620]  Is he a zombie?
[19:04.820 --> 19:05.720]  Where am I going to kick him?
[19:05.740 --> 19:08.880]  I'm going to kick him square in the chest with all my force if he keeps coming.
[19:09.380 --> 19:10.480]  If he catches me.
[19:11.120 --> 19:12.180]  I don't want to do this.
[19:12.180 --> 19:14.940]  I let us get very close and I didn't fire.
[19:15.080 --> 19:18.300]  I was going to wait till the last minute, but I just in my head, I had it worked out.
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.540]  That kid's going down.
[19:20.420 --> 19:21.900]  I didn't think it was a kid, though.
[19:21.960 --> 19:22.740]  I thought it was a zombie.
[19:23.080 --> 19:24.000]  What might have happened.
[19:24.860 --> 19:25.980]  Here's what I see happening.
[19:26.340 --> 19:27.320]  You kick a kid.
[19:27.580 --> 19:31.800]  The second you connect with this poor kid's chest, his mom opens the door to tell him
[19:31.800 --> 19:32.340]  dinner's ready.
[19:32.720 --> 19:39.080]  She sees an adult man beating up her eight year old son and she grabs a broom and she
[19:39.080 --> 19:40.040]  puts you in the hospital.
[19:41.680 --> 19:44.380]  Um, I don't like there was some distance.
[19:44.600 --> 19:46.580]  The kid wasn't exactly in front of his house.
[19:46.920 --> 19:48.600]  I think I could have evaded.
[19:48.620 --> 19:50.460]  There is enough like wooded area.
[19:50.820 --> 19:53.420]  I would have booked it so fucking fast after that kick.
[19:53.860 --> 19:58.660]  But the thing is, OK, so really the deciding point is if you would have sewing machined
[19:58.660 --> 20:00.060]  your way all the way to the forest.
[20:00.680 --> 20:01.820]  Yes, I would have.
[20:01.860 --> 20:06.140]  I would have used that sewing machine dexterity to get there in record time.
[20:07.340 --> 20:08.660]  That's the only consideration.
[20:08.660 --> 20:11.820]  If the kid was actually a zombie, I'm running home.
[20:11.960 --> 20:15.680]  If the kid just starts crying, then I'm running into the woods.
[20:15.760 --> 20:17.940]  I just love the idea of that headline.
[20:18.320 --> 20:21.820]  Like man kicks kid and runs into the woods.
[20:21.960 --> 20:23.560]  And you're like, I could explain.
[20:25.380 --> 20:26.820]  It was very, I don't know.
[20:26.860 --> 20:28.580]  Do you guys know what I mean by like the light?
[20:28.720 --> 20:31.560]  There was no, he was a fucking black shadows.
[20:32.200 --> 20:32.640]  Terrifying.
[20:32.900 --> 20:34.060]  He was silhouetted.
[20:34.880 --> 20:37.060]  Vancouver child kicker strikes again.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.420]  The city under siege.
[20:45.680 --> 20:49.000]  It was very intimidating.
[20:49.600 --> 20:51.880]  Are you telling me you would not, in that situation,
[20:52.380 --> 20:56.620]  there's no way in which you would kick the kid if he just keeps moving forward?
[20:56.700 --> 20:58.020]  I don't think so, man.
[20:58.960 --> 21:01.360]  14th child kicked in Vancouver Island.
[21:02.580 --> 21:05.800]  I'm not, I'm not a serial child kicker.
[21:05.860 --> 21:07.200]  When will this man be stopped?
[21:07.200 --> 21:09.320]  He kicked two people tonight.
[21:09.400 --> 21:10.660]  I'll be honest, Andrew.
[21:10.940 --> 21:13.400]  You don't know that you're not a serial child kicker.
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.500]  I'm, I'm pretty sure I'm not.
[21:15.620 --> 21:16.380]  Would I not know?
[21:16.460 --> 21:20.160]  Every one of us is a serial child kicker who just hasn't kicked their first child yet.
[21:21.240 --> 21:23.400]  That could have been your moment you found out.
[21:23.880 --> 21:24.940]  Once you pop.
[21:28.240 --> 21:29.680]  It became an addiction.
[21:30.260 --> 21:33.060]  I can't stop.
[21:34.280 --> 21:36.760]  Oh man, scurrying into the woods.
[21:37.200 --> 21:42.320]  This is like, imagine, imagine a very short version of that.
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.300]  That's what I was dealing with.
[21:45.040 --> 21:50.040]  Imagine, imagine that movie poster, but like him with shoes on his knees.
[21:54.140 --> 21:55.240]  It's like Dorf.
[21:58.480 --> 22:00.980]  I want a variant where you can just see the front.
[22:01.160 --> 22:03.580]  It's like wearing one of those hats to have a propeller on it.
[22:04.980 --> 22:09.280]  I'm imagining some sort of crazy chase scene between you and the police.
[22:09.780 --> 22:13.600]  You're like running down the street and someone cleaning the windows knocks over his ladder.
[22:13.760 --> 22:16.360]  And you look at the ladder on the floor and you're like, this is my time.
[22:16.480 --> 22:20.040]  And then you just speed up as you do the sewing machine through the ladder.
[22:20.280 --> 22:21.540]  That's Andrew and the kiddie kick.
[22:27.380 --> 22:29.920]  How did we get there? What were we talking about?
[22:34.800 --> 22:39.300]  You somehow managed to engineer yourself winning the, the signing thing.
[22:39.300 --> 22:41.500]  I don't know, but how did we get to whatever?
[22:41.800 --> 22:42.180]  Does it matter?
[22:42.320 --> 22:44.120]  You just said that you almost kicked a kid once.
[22:44.260 --> 22:44.580]  Yeah.
[22:45.740 --> 22:46.580]  There's a reason.
[22:46.960 --> 22:50.800]  I certainly didn't just come out of left field with a confession of that, that nature.
[22:50.920 --> 22:51.440]  I think you did.
[22:52.040 --> 22:52.940]  I don't think so.
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.640]  I'm pretty sure that came out of nothing.
[22:55.400 --> 22:58.940]  No, I think, I think that definitely came from somewhere.
[22:59.040 --> 22:59.880]  It came from you.
[23:00.200 --> 23:00.480]  Randomly.
[23:02.640 --> 23:09.260]  Gavin, do you, uh, do you ever find yourself possessed of any hyper violent urges?
[23:13.260 --> 23:14.440]  No, no, not really.
[23:15.120 --> 23:15.520]  Same.
[23:16.240 --> 23:19.840]  That was not hyper violent. That was purely a distance move.
[23:20.260 --> 23:24.200]  I didn't want to actually hurt. I wanted some distance. I wanted separation. I was very scared.
[23:24.400 --> 23:25.000]  It was intimidating.
[23:25.640 --> 23:29.160]  I don't think it's, uh, it's great that you're mocking this traumatic point in my life,
[23:29.220 --> 23:31.260]  which I almost kicked a kid. I was very scared.
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.300]  Oh, oh man.
[23:36.040 --> 23:36.860]  Oh my God.
[23:36.860 --> 23:39.820]  That kid, he has no idea how lucky he is.
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.260]  No, he has no clue. That's a great point. That kid is just living.
[23:43.560 --> 23:47.320]  Or how lucky Canada might be. He could grow up to be the next Justin Trudeau.
[23:48.500 --> 23:50.720]  Some kid called Peter listened to this podcast.
[23:52.920 --> 23:54.840]  He's like, oh, got away with that one.
[23:58.460 --> 24:00.740]  So how's your salad holding up? Is it wilting?
[24:01.060 --> 24:01.780]  Yeah, you gonna eat it now?
[24:02.400 --> 24:05.060]  Yeah, I guess we could. Well, how far are we into the show?
[24:05.060 --> 24:06.900]  We're 25 minutes in.
[24:07.080 --> 24:07.760]  We're like 25 minutes. Wow.
[24:08.420 --> 24:11.700]  Can I say one other thing? Because I meant to bring this up last time,
[24:11.800 --> 24:13.920]  and this is not going to be nearly the same type of pivot.
[24:14.440 --> 24:18.920]  I learned what this means. Gavin's talking about common things people know. I'll just
[24:18.920 --> 24:25.220]  type this into our Discord. I misunderstood what that has meant my entire life. I was right,
[24:25.300 --> 24:29.320]  though. I was kind of right about what it means. I just didn't understand it was an abbreviation.
[24:29.600 --> 24:30.540]  Like an acronym, you mean?
[24:30.780 --> 24:31.060]  Yeah.
[24:31.320 --> 24:32.000]  What did you think it was?
[24:32.120 --> 24:34.640]  I thought it was just like, like a huff sound.
[24:34.640 --> 24:36.480]  Make the sound you think it was.
[24:37.460 --> 24:38.620]  It'd be like a...
[24:41.940 --> 24:43.800]  I don't know whether that was cut off.
[24:47.400 --> 24:48.360]  There's no S sound.
[24:49.160 --> 24:51.740]  No, there's a lot of pressure in that moment, Geoff. And I was like,
[24:51.780 --> 24:55.620]  well, what sound would it be? And then I broke and then I kind of made the sound I wanted
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.160]  after doing that. It's just more like a perplexed noise you would make with your mouth.
[25:01.160 --> 25:04.920]  For those who can't see this part of the audio, Andrew has typed...
[25:06.040 --> 25:09.640]  We should have made a game where we see if the audience can guess what he's trying to say.
[25:09.880 --> 25:12.640]  Oh, we can. But I assume the reveal is going to be in this podcast.
[25:13.040 --> 25:13.820]  Yeah, that's true.
[25:13.920 --> 25:15.360]  We can cut my explanation if you want.
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.180]  I think we should do it the next episode. That's my vote. Maybe we should tease this.
[25:19.400 --> 25:20.240]  Great cliffhanger.
[25:20.580 --> 25:22.940]  All right. So what is it? Make the sound one more time.
[25:23.140 --> 25:24.000]  I don't think I can.
[25:24.260 --> 25:27.320]  Do your best. It's three letters. You just got to make the sound.
[25:27.520 --> 25:30.700]  And audience, you have to guess the three letters of the acronym.
[25:30.700 --> 25:32.220]  And what the acronym is. Okay.
[25:32.480 --> 25:33.880]  All right. Do it one more time for clarity.
[25:36.940 --> 25:37.900]  You're the worst.
[25:42.320 --> 25:43.160]  It's like a...
[25:45.340 --> 25:45.840]  Was that it?
[25:46.120 --> 25:49.900]  No, I'm trying... My mouth is very dry. This is a lot of pressure.
[25:50.540 --> 25:51.560]  Drink some waffle juice.
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.780]  I'm gonna... No, I have the waffle. I still have the waffle bomb.
[25:56.320 --> 25:59.820]  Okay. You know what? Actually, let's try it. No, I would genuinely vomit.
[25:59.820 --> 26:01.360]  We just need you to make the sound.
[26:04.680 --> 26:06.280]  That was a lot of letters.
[26:06.340 --> 26:10.600]  What was that? That's the best I can do at this moment.
[26:10.800 --> 26:11.500]  Okay, there you go.
[26:11.560 --> 26:11.980]  I tried.
[26:13.120 --> 26:15.640]  The audience, what do you think that was?
[26:15.720 --> 26:16.380]  There's no way.
[26:16.380 --> 26:19.360]  What three letter acronym do you think Andrew is trying to convey?
[26:20.960 --> 26:21.780]  There's no way.
[26:22.100 --> 26:22.460]  Okay.
[26:25.940 --> 26:26.680]  Maybe that?
[26:27.240 --> 26:27.760]  Like a...
[26:28.680 --> 26:30.380]  It's more like there's a body gesture.
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.540]  No, none of the sounds you made correspond with any of those letters.
[26:34.680 --> 26:40.880]  No, the irony is I can see what he's saying and I feel like he can make a sound that
[26:40.880 --> 26:44.000]  fits to what it is, but he's not even using the right letters.
[26:44.960 --> 26:46.380]  Well, it's tough to make the...
[26:49.780 --> 26:50.900]  Is that it?
[26:51.240 --> 26:56.640]  Gavin, I would ask you and I to make it too, but I don't want to make it too.
[26:57.060 --> 26:58.600]  Yeah, I feel like I would nail it.
[26:58.700 --> 26:59.320]  It'd be really easy.
[26:59.520 --> 27:01.740]  Same. I feel like if I said it, audience would get it immediately.
[27:02.080 --> 27:04.720]  So, Andrew, why don't you give it to us five or six more times?
[27:17.580 --> 27:22.680]  There is no way anyone on earth gets that from that.
[27:22.680 --> 27:26.700]  There's no point.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.620]  That's not even the argument I'm trying to make.
[27:28.700 --> 27:29.480]  I'm not saying I just...
[27:31.180 --> 27:32.960]  I misunderstood what it was.
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.140]  I thought it was a noise.
[27:34.460 --> 27:36.800]  Every single noise you made was completely different.
[27:37.100 --> 27:37.900]  Oh my god.
[27:39.760 --> 27:40.900]  I tried, okay?
[27:41.200 --> 27:44.920]  You had three letters at your disposal and you used the other 23.
[27:45.320 --> 27:46.400]  I tried really hard.
[27:46.960 --> 27:49.840]  I want all those noises to be played back to back, like all five of them,
[27:49.840 --> 27:52.840]  and then subtitled with the same three letters every time.
[27:56.700 --> 27:58.560]  It's really more of a mood.
[27:58.660 --> 27:59.740]  I felt like it was a vocal.
[27:59.980 --> 28:01.680]  It was like there's more than a sound.
[28:02.220 --> 28:03.700]  That letter, it was like an attitude.
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.980]  And the attitude represented what the action of the letters represent.
[28:09.240 --> 28:10.080]  Attitudes such as...
[28:14.320 --> 28:15.600]  And, and, and...
[28:17.300 --> 28:20.580]  See, I feel like that last one was pretty good.
[28:20.940 --> 28:22.360]  That's sort of what I wanted to go for.
[28:22.660 --> 28:23.780]  I think that's a good representation.
[28:24.540 --> 28:26.520]  This episode is brought to you by Wayfair.

[28:53.600 --> 28:57.160]  Did you know you lose 91 days a year to scrolling?
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.080]  That's your entire summer, gone.
[28:59.640 --> 29:04.100]  So this summer, log off and show up with friends and some ice cold Heinekens.
[29:04.440 --> 29:06.520]  Then instead of commenting on your crew's stories,
[29:06.920 --> 29:08.120]  you'll be making memories with them.
[29:08.620 --> 29:09.580]  Sorry, social media.
[29:09.860 --> 29:13.640]  The scrolling ends and the fun begins with cold Heinekens and good friends.
[29:13.640 --> 29:16.540]  Heineken, social networking since 1873.
[29:16.880 --> 29:20.560]  Available at your local Heineken retailer or for delivery at heineken.com.
[29:20.620 --> 29:21.980]  Must be 21 plus to purchase.
[29:22.220 --> 29:23.240]  Enjoy Heineken responsibly.
[29:23.980 --> 29:29.120]  Buenos dias! Café Bustelo espresso styled ice coffee is hitting refrigerators
[29:29.120 --> 29:31.640]  with a cold front that'll sweep through your senses.
[29:31.920 --> 29:35.220]  So keep the coffee pours long and the cold sips slow.
[29:35.840 --> 29:47.250]  If you're like me, you start thinking about what to eat for dinner when you're eating lunch.
[29:47.250 --> 29:50.630]  And you start thinking about what to eat for lunch when you're eating breakfast.
[29:50.950 --> 29:53.050]  And you start thinking about what to eat for breakfast
[29:53.050 --> 29:55.290]  when you're eating dinner again last night.
[29:55.350 --> 29:57.010]  Oh my god, it's a vicious cycle.
[29:57.290 --> 30:00.390]  And what am I supposed to do when I'm so busy
[30:00.390 --> 30:03.630]  that I don't have time to go into the kitchen and plan the perfect meal?
[30:04.050 --> 30:05.950]  I tell you what I do. I use Postmates.
[30:06.530 --> 30:10.370]  With Postmates, you can get food delivered without leaving your house or apartment.
[30:10.810 --> 30:13.730]  Or maybe you live at a Home Depot.
[30:13.970 --> 30:14.930]  You could probably get it delivered there.
[30:15.010 --> 30:17.090]  Maybe you live in a fitness gym.
[30:17.250 --> 30:18.530]  A lot of people do that these days, I hear.
[30:19.070 --> 30:22.950]  Anyway, Postmates, they'll deliver it without you having to leave your fitness gym house.
[30:23.470 --> 30:25.830]  Or even open your front door or their front door.
[30:25.890 --> 30:29.850]  It's probably most gyms, I would imagine they have the automated doors.
[30:29.990 --> 30:30.750]  But you get the gist.
[30:31.230 --> 30:35.270]  Anyway, with the current state of the world in mind, they've created no contact deliveries.
[30:35.810 --> 30:39.310]  So now when I order from local restaurants, everything gets left on my doorstep.
[30:39.450 --> 30:41.070]  And the app lets me know when it's been delivered.
[30:41.310 --> 30:44.470]  And then not only is that COVID safe,
[30:44.470 --> 30:47.470]  but it's introverted safe as well.
[30:48.070 --> 30:52.570]  Postmates also offers a pickup option, which I actually do use from time to time.
[30:52.670 --> 30:54.030]  Because you find yourself out and about.
[30:54.210 --> 30:56.230]  And sometimes you don't want to have to wait on a delivery driver.
[30:56.310 --> 30:58.190]  You want to be the delivery driver.
[30:58.290 --> 31:00.610]  You want to live vicariously through others.
[31:01.590 --> 31:03.930]  You know how you see the dude in the construction site and you think like,
[31:03.970 --> 31:07.950]  man, I better be cool to, I don't know, mix concrete all day long instead of play video games.
[31:08.970 --> 31:12.330]  And then he's probably like, man, I better be cool to be a dentist all day long and mix concrete.
[31:12.330 --> 31:16.510]  And the dentist is like, man, I bet it'd be really cool to be a librarian, etc, etc.
[31:17.410 --> 31:20.610]  But here you get to live the life of a delivery driver for a brief minute
[31:20.610 --> 31:22.930]  using Postmates to go pick your stuff up.
[31:22.930 --> 31:30.110]  And on top of all that, Postmates isn't just about burgers and sushi or sushi burgers or burger sushi.
[31:30.750 --> 31:33.790]  You can order anything from toilet paper to home chargers.
[31:33.910 --> 31:34.890]  I wouldn't eat those things.
[31:35.330 --> 31:37.570]  Those are not meant to be ordered as food
[31:37.570 --> 31:40.390]  because you can go to stores like Walgreens or 7-Eleven
[31:40.390 --> 31:43.050]  and Postmates will drop that stuff off on your front door too.
[31:43.170 --> 31:46.470]  Like say you need batteries for your Xbox controller at three in the morning.
[31:46.970 --> 31:51.490]  Postmates? Hello? It's me, Geoff. I need batteries. What's that?
[31:52.010 --> 31:52.890]  And then there they are.
[31:53.290 --> 31:55.730]  So just download Postmates on iOS or Android,
[31:56.370 --> 31:59.550]  find your favorites and get anything you want delivered within the hour.

[32:04.870 --> 32:06.910]  for your first seven days.

[32:12.550 --> 32:16.150]  That's code FACE for $5 off your first five orders
[32:16.150 --> 32:18.850]  when you download the Postmates app or sign up online.
[32:19.090 --> 32:21.610]  Anything you need, anytime you need it, Postmate it.
[32:22.030 --> 32:24.810]  You've heard me ask this question before, but I'm going to do it again.
[32:24.970 --> 32:26.190]  What is HelloFresh?
[32:26.430 --> 32:29.010]  Well, it's rhetorical because I know what HelloFresh is.
[32:29.050 --> 32:30.110]  You know what HelloFresh is.
[32:30.270 --> 32:33.850]  It's how to get the best made pre-measured ingredients
[32:33.850 --> 32:37.410]  that you turn into mouthwatering seasonal recipes,
[32:37.410 --> 32:41.630]  get it delivered to your house so that you just whip it up in the kitchen
[32:41.630 --> 32:46.070]  and you have perfectly portioned meals that are perfectly delicious,
[32:46.250 --> 32:48.570]  perfectly fun, and perfectly affordable.
[32:49.070 --> 32:51.770]  HelloFresh cuts out stressful meal planning and grocery store trips
[32:52.370 --> 32:56.250]  so you can enjoy cooking and get dinner on the table in about 30 minutes or less.
[32:56.730 --> 33:00.770]  I don't know about you, but I can't get through one aisle of the grocery store
[33:00.770 --> 33:01.770]  in less than 30 minutes.
[33:02.410 --> 33:05.670]  That place is a madhouse right now, even on the best of days.
[33:05.670 --> 33:10.930]  Even in the most non-pandemic of times, 30 minutes is nothing at a grocery store.
[33:11.610 --> 33:14.750]  HelloFresh also offers more than 25 recipes each week
[33:14.750 --> 33:17.970]  featuring a range of flavors and cuisines and ingredients
[33:17.970 --> 33:19.250]  so you'll never get bored.
[33:19.690 --> 33:23.030]  Don't be like me and eat the exact same thing every day.
[33:23.750 --> 33:29.450]  Live a little. Enjoy a range of flavors, a range of cuisines, a range of ingredients.
[33:30.170 --> 33:33.790]  And speaking of the grocery store time burglar that it is,
[33:33.790 --> 33:36.570]  it's also a savings burglar.
[33:36.790 --> 33:40.290]  Did you know that by using HelloFresh, you can cut down on your grocery bills
[33:40.290 --> 33:42.270]  by up to 40%?
[33:42.630 --> 33:47.050]  So it's not just time you're getting back, you're getting time and money back.
[33:47.130 --> 33:49.790]  I don't know how to get a better deal than that.
[33:50.090 --> 33:53.590]  HelloFresh is basically giving you fun, fresh food
[33:53.590 --> 33:56.170]  that you get to have a fun, fresh time cooking.
[33:56.310 --> 33:58.930]  You're getting fun, fresh time back from the grocery store
[33:58.930 --> 34:02.290]  and you're getting fun, fresh 40% savings from the grocery store.
[34:02.290 --> 34:05.190]  It's almost like we owe them. This deal's too good.
[34:05.470 --> 34:11.150]  So go to HelloFresh.com slash FaceTen and use code FaceTen for 10 free meals,
[34:11.350 --> 34:12.790]  including free shipping.
[34:13.190 --> 34:16.010]  That's HelloFresh.com slash FaceTen.
[34:18.250 --> 34:20.090]  Well, that was something out of nothing.
[34:20.630 --> 34:21.830]  Oh, God.
[34:22.090 --> 34:26.270]  Wow, that was a lot of podcast out of three letters that Andrew typed in the Discord.
[34:26.550 --> 34:27.910]  Oh, man.
[34:29.190 --> 34:31.050]  He's just prolonging his cream, though.
[34:31.050 --> 34:32.430]  I think that's what he's going for.
[34:32.810 --> 34:33.570]  Should I shake this?
[34:33.670 --> 34:35.170]  Like, OK, so this is what I did.
[34:35.490 --> 34:38.770]  I tweeted out, what is the best things to put on a salad?
[34:39.170 --> 34:40.150]  I got a huge list.
[34:40.510 --> 34:41.930]  A lot of people said a lot of different things.
[34:42.210 --> 34:43.770]  I'm taking the coffee approach.
[34:44.030 --> 34:46.970]  I just put all of the suggestions in that I could, essentially.
[34:47.170 --> 34:49.450]  So it's going to be a great salad because I put all the best things in it.
[34:49.470 --> 34:52.110]  So we got we got chow mein in here.
[34:52.170 --> 34:53.070]  We got croutons.
[34:53.170 --> 34:53.790]  We got bacon.
[34:53.870 --> 34:54.470]  We got chicken.
[34:54.550 --> 34:55.310]  We have some beef.
[34:55.630 --> 34:59.630]  We have almonds, walnuts, some apple.
[35:00.030 --> 35:02.130]  There's like 25 ingredients in the salad.
[35:02.250 --> 35:03.470]  Sounds like half of Waldorf.
[35:04.750 --> 35:05.150]  Yeah.
[35:05.610 --> 35:08.890]  Wait, when you said like the coffee thing, you mean your coffee thing?
[35:09.150 --> 35:10.130]  Not like the coffee thing?
[35:10.370 --> 35:11.070]  Yeah, my coffee.
[35:11.170 --> 35:13.970]  You know how I was just putting everything in the coffee to try to make it good?
[35:14.330 --> 35:15.610]  These are professional.
[35:15.790 --> 35:16.910]  I don't know if I'd say professional.
[35:17.070 --> 35:19.710]  These are, I'm assuming, informed opinions by people.
[35:19.910 --> 35:20.710]  By comment leavers.
[35:21.050 --> 35:22.150]  Comment leavers, yes.
[35:22.550 --> 35:24.790]  And so I just put all of them in the salad.
[35:24.930 --> 35:26.970]  So this I don't see how this could go wrong.
[35:26.970 --> 35:31.530]  And if it does, then salad cream just fucking sucks because these are all the best things
[35:31.530 --> 35:32.130]  to put in a salad.
[35:32.330 --> 35:33.350]  Okay, so let me get this straight.
[35:33.810 --> 35:38.610]  You've decided that in your tasting to determine whether you like this flavor of this thing
[35:38.610 --> 35:43.190]  you've never had, you thought you would create a salad that had every other possible flavor
[35:43.190 --> 35:43.930]  in it.
[35:44.090 --> 35:46.750]  I mean, I just asked, what are the best things to put in the salad?
[35:46.810 --> 35:47.810]  And I got an answer.
[35:47.970 --> 35:48.790]  I got a lot of answers.
[35:48.810 --> 35:49.770]  And I just went with those.
[35:50.030 --> 35:51.330]  I understand what you're saying.
[35:51.430 --> 35:53.570]  You're basically, you're saying to set yourself up for success.
[35:53.570 --> 35:55.690]  You want the cream of the ingredient crop.
[35:55.690 --> 35:57.210]  You want all of the best of the best.
[35:57.370 --> 36:03.650]  And if you top load the salad with the best flavors that it could possibly be in a salad,
[36:03.950 --> 36:06.830]  then and still don't like salad cream.
[36:07.010 --> 36:09.210]  It can only be the fault of the salad cream.
[36:09.690 --> 36:10.090]  Exactly.
[36:10.370 --> 36:11.410]  It's a very Panton approach.
[36:11.530 --> 36:11.970]  I like it.
[36:12.050 --> 36:14.410]  I'm trying very hard to like salad cream.
[36:14.530 --> 36:15.670]  How much do I put on?
[36:16.010 --> 36:16.350]  Enough.
[36:16.710 --> 36:16.990]  Enough.
[36:17.110 --> 36:17.910]  I don't know what that means.
[36:18.190 --> 36:19.350]  I do half a cup.
[36:19.410 --> 36:21.190]  Yeah, you don't fucking, I'm not talking to you.
[36:21.270 --> 36:22.250]  You've never had salad cream.
[36:22.450 --> 36:24.690]  What we do, what's the cap situation?
[36:24.690 --> 36:25.470]  Is it a slit?
[36:25.750 --> 36:26.430]  What do you mean?
[36:26.470 --> 36:27.270]  It's just like a bottle.
[36:27.390 --> 36:28.310]  Well, how's it dispensing?
[36:28.390 --> 36:29.470]  Is it through a hole or a slit?
[36:29.690 --> 36:30.230]  Through a hole.
[36:31.070 --> 36:34.650]  I'd give it maybe a spiral two second squeeze.
[36:34.850 --> 36:36.350]  A spiral two second squeeze.
[36:36.470 --> 36:36.670]  Okay.
[36:36.970 --> 36:38.870]  Do you do clockwise or counterclockwise, Gavin?
[36:39.190 --> 36:40.250]  What hemisphere is he in?
[36:40.430 --> 36:41.550]  I'd go clockwise.
[36:41.910 --> 36:42.190]  Really?
[36:42.710 --> 36:46.010]  I feel like my natural spiral squeeze would be counterclockwise.
[36:46.730 --> 36:47.090]  Really?
[36:47.390 --> 36:48.330]  What if it's because I'm left-handed?
[36:48.650 --> 36:49.570]  Oh, I think that's it.
[36:49.650 --> 36:49.810]  Yeah.
[36:49.850 --> 36:51.250]  Because I'm going away from my body.
[36:51.550 --> 36:51.930]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:52.110 --> 36:52.970]  Let me try it.
[36:52.970 --> 36:55.730]  It's tough to get all this stuff on one fork pull.
[36:55.830 --> 36:56.990]  I gotta make sure I got some bacon.
[36:57.450 --> 36:58.510]  I got some chow mein.
[36:59.210 --> 36:59.590]  Chips.
[36:59.730 --> 37:00.490]  I got some pine nuts.
[37:00.590 --> 37:01.250]  I got some almonds.
[37:01.970 --> 37:03.510]  I don't think I can fit an apple in here.
[37:04.170 --> 37:04.630]  Here we go.
[37:05.270 --> 37:07.770]  It's like just even getting it to the mouth is difficult.
[37:08.010 --> 37:10.550]  Did you have a control bite with no salad cream first?
[37:10.690 --> 37:11.350]  Yeah, what are you doing?
[37:11.410 --> 37:12.730]  Are you eating just the salad now?
[37:16.850 --> 37:19.470]  So there's no salad cream on this yet?
[37:19.670 --> 37:21.010]  No, I put the salad cream on.
[37:21.910 --> 37:24.050]  Wait, you did put it on?
[37:24.350 --> 37:24.550]  No.
[37:25.950 --> 37:28.070]  I don't either.
[37:28.370 --> 37:28.990]  Why wouldn't I?
[37:29.190 --> 37:31.470]  Because you haven't tried it without the salad cream yet.
[37:31.610 --> 37:32.890]  There's no dressing on it.
[37:33.110 --> 37:33.410]  What?
[37:33.850 --> 37:35.110]  That's just gonna be a shitty salad.
[37:35.210 --> 37:35.770]  There's no dressing.
[37:36.130 --> 37:38.450]  You're the one that said you don't like dressing on salad.
[37:39.010 --> 37:40.470]  You told us you like it dry.
[37:41.150 --> 37:43.610]  Yeah, but I typically don't put this much dry stuff on it.
[37:43.650 --> 37:45.230]  This is just like ridiculously dry.
[37:47.550 --> 37:48.810]  I don't understand.
[37:49.510 --> 37:50.310]  How is the salad?
[37:50.310 --> 37:52.530]  I couldn't really taste it because all the other stuff...
[37:57.170 --> 37:58.130]  And try again.
[37:58.190 --> 38:01.210]  You're like a nightmare on legs.
[38:02.750 --> 38:03.890]  Eric, I agree with you.
[38:03.930 --> 38:06.390]  Eric just wrote, I still don't know if the cream is on it or not.
[38:06.750 --> 38:07.950]  You are the...
[38:07.950 --> 38:08.830]  I put the cream on it.
[38:08.970 --> 38:09.630]  Fucking what?
[38:10.070 --> 38:11.330]  I put the cream on it, you know what?
[38:11.670 --> 38:12.710]  There's no benchmark.
[38:13.350 --> 38:14.110]  What do you mean though?
[38:14.370 --> 38:15.850]  What do you mean, what does he mean?
[38:16.090 --> 38:18.910]  Did you stir in the cream or are you just eating lumps of salad cream?
[38:18.910 --> 38:20.710]  No, I stirred it in.
[38:20.910 --> 38:22.690]  God, you are the definition of frustration.
[38:23.210 --> 38:29.470]  This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear the first moment someone tried salad cream and you've...
[38:29.470 --> 38:30.090]  It was very good.
[38:30.210 --> 38:30.990]  Made it pointless.
[38:31.650 --> 38:34.370]  No, what do you mean I made it pointless? I tried the salad cream.
[38:34.970 --> 38:36.770]  There was no control.
[38:37.230 --> 38:40.230]  We don't know whether you like this salad cream or this salad.
[38:40.610 --> 38:43.870]  Yeah, oh, I see you're... oh, no, this is a great salad.
[38:44.070 --> 38:45.630]  With salad cream, it was also good.
[38:46.430 --> 38:47.430]  Let me ask you this.
[38:47.550 --> 38:49.570]  Have you ever had this salad before?
[38:50.010 --> 38:51.290]  No, of course not.
[38:51.330 --> 38:53.190]  There's like 40 fucking ingredients in this.
[38:53.530 --> 38:54.390]  It's loaded.
[38:55.510 --> 38:57.030]  I would never make this salad.
[38:57.130 --> 38:58.030]  It's way too much work.
[38:58.170 --> 38:59.450]  That's why I didn't make it last week.
[38:59.530 --> 39:00.630]  It requires a lot of time.
[39:00.750 --> 39:04.870]  It's like being like, all right, let's test out how well this poison works on this person here.
[39:05.010 --> 39:08.190]  I'm gonna shoot him a bunch first, but we'll see how the poison works.
[39:08.510 --> 39:09.130]  Okay, what about this?
[39:09.170 --> 39:14.030]  What if I just go clean leaf, nothing else, just salad leaf, cream on salad leaf?
[39:14.090 --> 39:14.990]  Would that be acceptable?
[39:14.990 --> 39:16.170]  That's revolutionary.
[39:16.430 --> 39:17.690]  How did you come up with that?
[39:17.850 --> 39:18.730]  That's, uh, you know what?
[39:19.230 --> 39:20.550]  I'm a genius, Gavin, that's why.
[39:21.010 --> 39:22.790]  Take some water to cleanse your palate first.
[39:23.110 --> 39:23.590]  Take a swig.
[39:23.870 --> 39:25.030]  I have Gatorade, is that okay?
[39:25.050 --> 39:25.430]  That's fine.
[39:25.590 --> 39:26.550]  Is Gatorade... okay.
[39:26.830 --> 39:27.750]  Eat some ginger.
[39:28.070 --> 39:29.050]  Oh, that would have been a good addition.
[39:29.170 --> 39:30.090]  I didn't put ginger in this.
[39:31.290 --> 39:34.510]  Okay, well, I just almost fucking knocked my Gatorade over.
[39:35.210 --> 39:36.830]  I threw the salad cream.
[39:37.130 --> 39:38.050]  That could have went bad.
[39:39.570 --> 39:40.950]  Oh, shit, my bad.
[39:41.030 --> 39:42.610]  People waited three weeks for this.
[39:43.310 --> 39:44.330]  I'm trying another bite.
[39:44.330 --> 39:47.270]  This is just pure salad cream on the salad leaf.
[39:48.090 --> 39:49.650]  Eat the salad on its own first.
[39:49.710 --> 39:50.890]  I'm eating, relax.
[39:51.070 --> 39:51.470]  I am.
[39:51.530 --> 39:52.830]  What the fuck do you want me to do?
[39:53.290 --> 39:54.270]  I'm doing it.
[39:54.650 --> 39:55.790]  I don't think you are.
[39:56.030 --> 39:57.810]  You said you put the salad cream on it.
[39:57.990 --> 39:59.930]  You want me just to fucking taste lettuce?
[40:00.410 --> 40:01.570]  What are you talking about?
[40:03.670 --> 40:07.670]  Aren't we trying to decide whether salad is made better with salad cream or not?
[40:07.970 --> 40:10.570]  Yeah, I thought it was just, do I like the taste of salad cream?
[40:10.670 --> 40:11.730]  I don't mind it.
[40:11.970 --> 40:14.050]  I feel like I'm successful in this test.
[40:14.050 --> 40:14.910]  All right.
[40:15.110 --> 40:15.590]  Okay.
[40:15.810 --> 40:16.110]  Okay.
[40:16.410 --> 40:17.990]  Let me, let me ask you a question.
[40:19.210 --> 40:20.890]  That's a completely different question.
[40:20.970 --> 40:23.310]  We're not asking, does the salad cream elevate the salad?
[40:23.730 --> 40:24.890]  It's, do I like the salad?
[40:25.270 --> 40:26.410]  I like the salad.
[40:26.990 --> 40:27.090]  Wait.
[40:27.230 --> 40:27.710]  The cream is good.
[40:27.990 --> 40:29.170]  Have you guys ever heard of this salad?
[40:29.290 --> 40:34.970]  You think, you think that the question that's being asked is, do you like the salad?
[40:35.910 --> 40:36.390]  Yeah.
[40:36.550 --> 40:38.010]  What else would be the point of this?
[40:39.750 --> 40:43.890]  A salad that you just made up that we haven't even discussed before.
[40:44.050 --> 40:46.490]  The whole point was the salad cream.
[40:47.430 --> 40:47.910]  No.
[40:48.610 --> 40:49.090]  No.
[40:49.610 --> 40:50.250]  The salad cream is...
[40:50.250 --> 40:50.650]  No.
[40:50.810 --> 40:50.970]  Okay.
[40:51.090 --> 40:52.630]  This is, you're being ridiculous.
[40:52.870 --> 40:55.790]  The salad cream is so clearly part of the salad.
[40:56.050 --> 40:56.930]  I put it in.
[40:57.430 --> 41:02.710]  So two weeks ago when you were sniffing the salad cream, I, I'm so confused.
[41:02.910 --> 41:04.390]  I don't understand why you're confused.
[41:04.470 --> 41:04.590]  Wait.
[41:04.670 --> 41:04.830]  Okay.
[41:04.850 --> 41:05.190]  Hang on.
[41:05.290 --> 41:05.950]  Let's find out.
[41:06.050 --> 41:09.950]  Hey, Geoff, what's on the salad that we're seeing if Andrew likes it or not?
[41:10.250 --> 41:11.330]  Why does that matter?
[41:11.770 --> 41:12.930]  Because that's the question.
[41:12.930 --> 41:15.430]  If you like the salad, I guess.
[41:15.870 --> 41:19.230]  No, I thought, okay, well, the salad, let me, let me, okay.
[41:19.330 --> 41:21.070]  Let's take a few steps back here.
[41:21.170 --> 41:26.030]  I didn't think this could be taken down so far from what it could have been.
[41:26.190 --> 41:26.930]  No, no, no, no, no.
[41:27.090 --> 41:30.550]  The ultimate question was, do I like salad cream?
[41:30.570 --> 41:30.830]  Right?
[41:31.010 --> 41:31.570]  Isn't that it?
[41:31.710 --> 41:32.850]  Wasn't that what we're going for?
[41:32.970 --> 41:33.890]  Salad cream good.
[41:34.270 --> 41:35.610]  Isn't that the point of this question?
[41:35.810 --> 41:36.290]  Uh, yeah.
[41:36.550 --> 41:36.710]  Yeah.
[41:37.070 --> 41:37.290]  Yeah.
[41:37.350 --> 41:37.750]  Right.
[41:37.950 --> 41:38.290]  Okay.
[41:38.290 --> 41:45.150]  So then I made a fucking great salad with salad cream and I had a great time eating.
[41:45.390 --> 41:46.270]  Tasted great.
[41:46.530 --> 41:48.770]  Then you're like, well, what about the cream?
[41:48.850 --> 41:49.370]  What about the cream?
[41:49.390 --> 41:50.750]  The cream was in the fucking salad.
[41:50.930 --> 41:53.230]  So then I took all the stuff off the salad.
[41:53.330 --> 41:55.090]  I just had fucking lettuce and cream.
[41:55.310 --> 41:56.150]  Still good.
[41:56.490 --> 41:58.170]  I don't see how this doesn't answer.
[41:58.590 --> 41:59.790]  Salad cream isn't that bad.
[41:59.990 --> 42:03.310]  Because you said the question was if you like the salad.
[42:03.930 --> 42:05.470]  Maybe I misspoke.
[42:05.470 --> 42:08.330]  Which I don't care if you like the salad.
[42:08.450 --> 42:10.790]  I want to know about the salad cream.
[42:11.250 --> 42:14.990]  Eric, Andrew wasn't into the benchmark and he was applying real world to it.
[42:15.610 --> 42:20.050]  But if I didn't like the salad, then I certainly would have disliked the cream.
[42:20.350 --> 42:22.390]  If I like the salad, I like the cream.
[42:22.750 --> 42:24.250]  It's answering the same question.
[42:24.910 --> 42:29.830]  If this cream is in the salad and I like the salad, then I like the cream.
[42:29.830 --> 42:35.390]  That's like saying if I put ketchup on these chips, I like it.
[42:35.450 --> 42:38.370]  If I put it on this dead fox, I don't like ketchup.
[42:38.570 --> 42:38.930]  What?
[42:40.430 --> 42:42.810]  This ketchup isn't making the roadkill any good.
[42:42.890 --> 42:44.430]  This is my favorite show.
[42:46.210 --> 42:48.290]  I'm genuinely confused by what you want from me.
[42:48.330 --> 42:50.290]  I feel like I've accommodated you in every way.
[42:50.390 --> 42:50.930]  Wait, hang on.
[42:51.070 --> 42:53.490]  We can get Geoff to sort this out.
[42:53.690 --> 42:55.050]  Geoff, how do you feel about this?
[42:55.570 --> 42:56.590]  Guys, I'll be honest.
[42:56.590 --> 43:00.190]  I don't. I think Andrew broke me a little bit here.
[43:00.470 --> 43:02.730]  You've just been silent for like four minutes.
[43:02.770 --> 43:03.030]  Okay.
[43:03.310 --> 43:05.390]  I don't know how to respond.
[43:07.610 --> 43:14.190]  Andrew's obfuscation and double talk is so frustrating and he's got me confused.
[43:14.290 --> 43:15.310]  I don't know anymore.
[43:15.850 --> 43:21.030]  I went in knowing and then Andrew got me all jumbled and I don't know what's up or down.
[43:21.130 --> 43:21.630]  I don't know.
[43:22.970 --> 43:24.310]  That made me dumber.
[43:24.310 --> 43:26.170]  I feel dumber too!
[43:26.570 --> 43:28.770]  No, let's go back to the start, okay?
[43:29.210 --> 43:32.170]  Oh, do we have to dissect how you fucked us on this?
[43:32.430 --> 43:33.110]  Yes. Yeah.
[43:33.370 --> 43:33.990]  Yeah, I do.
[43:34.170 --> 43:34.930]  I need to know.
[43:35.170 --> 43:36.590]  How can I correct this?
[43:36.710 --> 43:37.230]  What can I do?
[43:37.370 --> 43:37.930]  It's over.
[43:38.310 --> 43:39.410]  You did what you did.
[43:39.590 --> 43:40.370]  No, what can I do?
[43:40.490 --> 43:41.350]  How do I correct this?
[43:41.410 --> 43:42.370]  What should I have done?
[43:42.550 --> 43:43.630]  What would have been the thing to do?
[43:43.890 --> 43:46.150]  Oh, in my opinion, you would have prepared a very simple salad.
[43:46.390 --> 43:48.730]  Sort of the most basic benchmark salad.
[43:48.950 --> 43:50.710]  You would have eaten it with nothing on it.
[43:50.710 --> 43:54.430]  Or maybe some dressing, some standard dressing that you've had before.
[43:54.830 --> 43:58.090]  And then you would have the same salad again, but with salad cream.
[43:58.350 --> 44:03.170]  And that would tell us whether salad cream improved the salad or whether it made it worse.
[44:03.390 --> 44:05.550]  I feel like we even had a discussion about that.
[44:05.650 --> 44:07.750]  I feel like we had a conversation where we even said,
[44:08.010 --> 44:10.770]  like, you'll eat it, eat one salad with the salad cream,
[44:10.850 --> 44:12.710]  and then one salad with your favorite dressing.
[44:12.870 --> 44:16.270]  And you said, I don't typically eat dressing on my salad, I like it dry.
[44:16.370 --> 44:19.050]  And we said, okay, well then a dry salad like you normally eat it,
[44:19.050 --> 44:22.190]  and then a salad with salad cream, and then...
[44:22.190 --> 44:24.130]  There's still salad that doesn't have cream on it.
[44:24.150 --> 44:29.030]  He treated it like a child would in a hotel ordering everything on the room service menu.
[44:29.350 --> 44:29.530]  Yes.
[44:29.610 --> 44:30.790]  And then he put salad cream on it.
[44:30.830 --> 44:35.570]  I wanted to like salad cream, so I asked people what the great salad toppings were,
[44:35.690 --> 44:38.530]  and I went with the people. I'm a man of the people. I listened to their advice.
[44:38.530 --> 44:43.190]  It's like when you're a kid and your uncle takes you to like Baskin Robbins for the first time,
[44:43.390 --> 44:46.730]  and he's irresponsible, and you're like, what can I get?
[44:46.770 --> 44:48.730]  And he's like, I don't know, I'm an uncle.
[44:48.730 --> 44:50.410]  And you're like, okay, I'll get everything.
[44:51.790 --> 44:53.790]  You get 32 flavors of ice cream,
[44:53.850 --> 44:55.970]  and then you can't sleep for the next week because you got a tummy ache.
[44:56.030 --> 44:58.090]  So your issue is just I put too much in the salad.
[44:58.130 --> 45:02.090]  Well, also, by the time that we had even started talking about the order of things
[45:02.090 --> 45:03.990]  and whether you're going to do a benchmark salad,
[45:04.330 --> 45:06.890]  you had salad cream in your esophagus.
[45:07.030 --> 45:07.330]  Yes.
[45:07.450 --> 45:08.530]  Already at that point.
[45:08.630 --> 45:12.130]  It's like you were squirting it down your gullet while we were talking about it.
[45:12.150 --> 45:15.590]  There's still a large part of the salad that is untouched by cream.
[45:15.590 --> 45:18.010]  I could have another sip or not sip.
[45:18.090 --> 45:21.370]  I'm going to sip to have a cleanse and palate cleansing right now.
[45:21.650 --> 45:22.430]  Let me ask you a question.
[45:22.670 --> 45:26.730]  As a palate cleanse, I'll have another bite of salad. No cream.
[45:27.050 --> 45:27.990]  Let me ask you this.
[45:28.090 --> 45:31.010]  Did that salad cream segment go as well as you hoped?
[45:31.810 --> 45:33.390]  I mean, I'm eating a great fucking salad.
[45:33.530 --> 45:34.350]  Dude, I'm doing okay.
[45:34.690 --> 45:35.670]  It's a win-win for you.
[45:35.890 --> 45:38.010]  I'll be 100% honest.
[45:38.150 --> 45:39.010]  Andrew gave me a headache.
[45:39.510 --> 45:40.710]  I now have a fucking headache.
[45:42.150 --> 45:47.970]  I've been like pushing my hands into my forehead and the top of my nose and just trying to...
[45:48.550 --> 45:49.410]  and now I have a headache.
[45:49.910 --> 45:52.010]  I just had a big bacon chunk on that one.
[45:52.130 --> 45:53.310]  Bacon is such a good topping.
[45:53.570 --> 45:54.990]  You physically wronged me.
[45:55.770 --> 45:57.130]  Let me ask you a question, Andrew.
[45:57.630 --> 46:01.030]  In salad cream on like bacon and apples.
[46:01.410 --> 46:03.870]  I understand, based on previous conversations,
[46:04.530 --> 46:06.550]  that you don't typically have salad dressing.
[46:06.690 --> 46:09.070]  But I assume that if you must have salad dressing...
[46:09.070 --> 46:11.770]  and in this scenario, we're not talking cream right now, okay?
[46:12.430 --> 46:15.670]  If you have to have a dressing and all dressings are available to you,
[46:16.010 --> 46:17.110]  what salad dressing do you pick?
[46:17.410 --> 46:19.770]  I might go... well, you know, it kind of depends on the salad.
[46:19.910 --> 46:22.490]  Like, obviously, if you're going with a Caesar, you'd have a Caesar dressing.
[46:22.610 --> 46:26.670]  If I'm just having my average salad, I'd probably have like a honey mustard vinaigrette.
[46:26.750 --> 46:27.290]  Okay, thank you.
[46:28.230 --> 46:28.650]  Next question.
[46:28.770 --> 46:29.910]  You have the same salad.
[46:30.010 --> 46:30.590]  It's not a Caesar.
[46:30.690 --> 46:31.570]  It's just a salad salad.
[46:31.890 --> 46:33.650]  Maybe it's got some of the components in this salad.
[46:33.710 --> 46:34.270]  Maybe it doesn't.
[46:34.470 --> 46:35.170]  I don't give a fuck.
[46:35.350 --> 46:36.310]  But you got three of them.
[46:36.510 --> 46:37.470]  You got one dry.
[46:37.470 --> 46:39.890]  You got one with honey mustard vinaigrette.
[46:39.970 --> 46:42.010]  And you've got one with salad cream.
[46:42.590 --> 46:43.910]  Which one do you reach for?
[46:44.150 --> 46:45.150]  You're only eating one.
[46:45.490 --> 46:46.610]  I'm gonna have the dry one.
[46:46.750 --> 46:48.130]  I'd rank dry one number one.
[46:48.650 --> 46:49.830]  Honey mustard number two.
[46:49.970 --> 46:50.690]  Salad cream three.
[46:50.830 --> 46:51.050]  Okay.
[46:51.190 --> 46:52.350]  You don't like salad cream.
[46:52.810 --> 46:54.790]  No, it's not that I dislike salad cream.
[46:54.930 --> 46:57.990]  It's just I like the other two more than salad cream.
[46:58.130 --> 47:03.210]  It's just like you would choose any other dressing or the absence of dressing over it.
[47:03.310 --> 47:05.690]  Yeah, well, yeah, I guess you got to make the scale right.
[47:05.690 --> 47:07.590]  The top of the pyramid is no dressing.
[47:07.810 --> 47:10.370]  That's like a solid, that's like a 9.7.
[47:10.630 --> 47:11.650]  So it's good.
[47:11.850 --> 47:14.430]  It's good, but not as good as not existing.
[47:14.770 --> 47:17.510]  Yeah, I don't think I'd ever order salad cream.
[47:17.770 --> 47:21.010]  But if there was like, I just happened to be on my salad.
[47:21.270 --> 47:25.230]  I didn't notice that it was listed on the menu as being a topping for the salad, the dressing on it.
[47:25.410 --> 47:26.410]  I wouldn't return it.
[47:26.590 --> 47:27.390]  I'd be okay with it.
[47:27.810 --> 47:29.150]  It's better than I anticipated.
[47:29.590 --> 47:29.850]  Okay.
[47:29.970 --> 47:33.690]  When you were doing science class at school and the teacher was like,
[47:33.690 --> 47:36.750]  I'm gonna pour this shit in this beaker, mix it with this shit.
[47:36.930 --> 47:40.950]  Did you just walk past all that and walk up to the teacher and just say, tell me the answer?
[47:41.570 --> 47:43.710]  I feel like you're giving me a lot of shit.
[47:43.910 --> 47:47.870]  And I'm giving you like four different salad takes here about this salad cream.
[47:48.010 --> 47:49.630]  I think I deserve an A+.
[47:49.630 --> 47:52.590]  I've gone the extra mile and trying to accommodate your needs.
[47:52.870 --> 47:59.950]  You're, listen, I'll give you an A plus for how thorough you with, but your lab work was spotty.
[48:01.710 --> 48:02.910]  I will, you know what?
[48:02.910 --> 48:04.350]  I'm willing to own that.
[48:04.590 --> 48:07.830]  I wanted to be a man of the people, so I wanted to make kind of my own salad,
[48:08.010 --> 48:12.450]  but I understand for the purposes of evaluation that that wasn't the way to go.
[48:12.510 --> 48:13.670]  You know what I think just happened?
[48:13.870 --> 48:15.430]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a different angle on this.
[48:15.730 --> 48:17.950]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna choose to, I'm gonna choose to sunny side up this.
[48:18.450 --> 48:24.370]  Andrew, why don't you lay out the ingredients of the salad you just invented?
[48:24.430 --> 48:25.730]  The Andrew Panton salad.
[48:25.970 --> 48:27.810]  That's what I was gonna do, Geoff.
[48:27.870 --> 48:28.890]  The Panton, the official.
[48:29.590 --> 48:30.330]  What do you call it?
[48:30.330 --> 48:31.130]  What do you call your salad?
[48:31.310 --> 48:32.090]  I don't know.
[48:32.090 --> 48:34.250]  I feel like a Panton salad is not a great name.
[48:34.530 --> 48:35.410]  The child kicker?
[48:35.590 --> 48:37.230]  The child, I like the child kicker.
[48:37.230 --> 48:37.890]  Yeah, chest burster.
[48:38.170 --> 48:39.930]  I don't like it, but it's the chest.
[48:41.450 --> 48:43.570]  I think that's the right, the right type angle.
[48:43.690 --> 48:45.850]  I don't, I think I honestly, I need to look at my list.
[48:45.970 --> 48:46.910]  There's so many ingredients.
[48:47.030 --> 48:49.570]  As I said, there are almonds, walnuts, there's some beef in there.
[48:49.610 --> 48:51.490]  There's some bacon, there's some chicken.
[48:51.750 --> 48:55.890]  We should try and get a restaurant to sponsor this podcast and potentially put that on their menu.
[48:55.990 --> 48:59.010]  What kind of greens are you, are you building this out of?
[48:59.010 --> 49:02.950]  I got some, your standard kind of romaine lettuce, but also I got some spinach in there
[49:02.950 --> 49:04.390]  because that was a recommendation as well.
[49:04.510 --> 49:04.670]  Okay.
[49:05.050 --> 49:05.690]  Higher iron too.
[49:05.710 --> 49:06.150]  Best of both.
[49:06.890 --> 49:07.810]  Yeah, that's great.
[49:07.890 --> 49:08.670]  This is a great salad.
[49:09.030 --> 49:09.650]  Salad cream.
[49:09.970 --> 49:10.650]  No salad cream.
[49:10.810 --> 49:11.150]  Good salad.
[49:11.250 --> 49:14.030]  I think it has to have salad cream to be a part of it.
[49:14.050 --> 49:14.910]  I agree for this.
[49:15.070 --> 49:15.690]  Yes, for this.
[49:15.750 --> 49:19.170]  I'm just saying on off days, personally, I probably wouldn't go cream on it.
[49:19.370 --> 49:22.250]  So F*** Face has taken the collectible world by storm.
[49:22.330 --> 49:24.510]  Now we're taking the culinary world by storm.
[49:24.590 --> 49:25.890]  We have our first official recipe.
[49:26.170 --> 49:28.810]  If we can get Heinz to sponsor, Heinz UK to sponsor an episode,
[49:28.810 --> 49:29.490]  that'd be ideal.
[49:29.770 --> 49:29.890]  Yeah.
[49:30.310 --> 49:32.530]  Andrew, I assume you've already contacted them.
[49:33.010 --> 49:34.070]  Not about this.
[49:34.430 --> 49:38.130]  I haven't talked to them since the bottle, since the bottle thing.
[49:38.630 --> 49:40.090]  I will say, you know, an interesting part.
[49:40.170 --> 49:41.230]  I never really considered this.
[49:41.610 --> 49:45.290]  Having all these toppings in, it kind of gives you the perspective of what is like
[49:45.290 --> 49:46.490]  the greatest salad topping.
[49:46.990 --> 49:48.210]  The bacon really shined.
[49:48.670 --> 49:51.990]  Getting that little bit of bacon in there, the flavor, the texture, really,
[49:52.190 --> 49:53.930]  it might be the best salad topping.
[49:54.070 --> 49:57.330]  I'm glad from this salad cream experiment, we've established that you like bacon.
[49:57.330 --> 49:58.810]  I'm glad we got that out of it.
[49:59.670 --> 50:03.330]  All right, now I have to ask a question, because bacon can mean a lot of things.
[50:03.770 --> 50:08.810]  Is these like the crunchy little like kind of reddish bacon bits that you shake out of a can?
[50:08.870 --> 50:12.370]  Or are they ones, the ones that come out of the bag that's like supposed to be real bits
[50:12.370 --> 50:13.050]  of crumbled bacon?
[50:13.250 --> 50:15.470]  Or is this like strips of bacon you cooked yourself?
[50:15.810 --> 50:18.990]  I cooked strips of bacon and then I cut it into smaller pieces.
[50:19.330 --> 50:19.810]  Oh, wow.
[50:20.250 --> 50:21.690]  Kudos, sir. You are a true chef.
[50:21.810 --> 50:22.410]  That sounds delicious.
[50:22.650 --> 50:26.770]  So I've got to ask, because we started this whole conversation with you asking me what
[50:26.770 --> 50:27.990]  salad cream tasted like.
[50:28.330 --> 50:29.530]  Let me ask you this, Andrew.
[50:29.610 --> 50:31.010]  What does salad cream taste like?
[50:31.150 --> 50:32.950]  Kind of like a watery honey mustard.
[50:33.490 --> 50:33.890]  Watery?
[50:34.010 --> 50:34.930]  Did you not shake it?
[50:35.110 --> 50:38.670]  No, I was shaking a lot during the whole kicking the kid conversation.
[50:38.870 --> 50:41.090]  It should have the consistency of like a mayo.
[50:41.510 --> 50:45.390]  It does have, yeah, it does have the consistency of a mayo.
[50:45.530 --> 50:49.630]  It kind of has the smell and tang of like a honey mustard, like a lighter honey mustard.
[50:49.950 --> 50:51.110]  But it tasted like bacon.
[50:51.690 --> 50:53.210]  No, the bacon tasted like bacon.
[50:53.330 --> 50:54.930]  I was a big fan of the bacon taste.
[50:55.130 --> 50:56.070]  Doesn't taste like that.
[50:56.070 --> 50:57.690]  It's a lesser honey mustard.
[50:57.830 --> 51:02.090]  I feel like if you like honey mustard, you probably would be OK with salad cream.
[51:02.230 --> 51:02.430]  Interesting.
[51:02.490 --> 51:04.530]  Although honey mustard has a huge range of flavors.
[51:04.770 --> 51:07.950]  It's interesting to hear the thoughts of someone on your continent.
[51:08.490 --> 51:09.690]  Do your thoughts differ from mine?
[51:09.950 --> 51:11.230]  I'd have to have it again. It's been a while.
[51:11.550 --> 51:11.930]  That's fair.
[51:12.410 --> 51:14.970]  You know, as funny as I ordered this and it was shipped to me from Ireland,
[51:15.410 --> 51:17.450]  and I went to the grocery store and it was just there.
[51:20.090 --> 51:22.410]  I could have went five minutes and pick one up.
[51:22.490 --> 51:24.070]  I had it sent to me from Ireland.
[51:24.630 --> 51:28.510]  Oh, I wonder if you could taste the difference between your special imported
[51:28.510 --> 51:30.070]  salad cream or whether you're local.
[51:30.070 --> 51:32.170]  They say the Guinness tastes better in Ireland, right?
[51:32.270 --> 51:33.550]  Maybe the salad cream does too.
[51:33.770 --> 51:36.090]  That's true, though. It actually does taste really good there.
[51:36.210 --> 51:36.650]  What does?
[51:36.910 --> 51:37.270]  Guinness.
[51:37.570 --> 51:39.010]  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[51:39.390 --> 51:41.370]  That's where the factory is, right?
[51:41.830 --> 51:42.450]  Ireland? No.
[51:43.530 --> 51:44.530]  Yeah, that's right.
[51:44.930 --> 51:47.510]  This might be the first face that I've wanted to end.
[51:48.730 --> 51:49.950]  Why do you want it to end?
[51:50.250 --> 51:51.810]  I don't know, just be worn out.
[51:52.190 --> 51:52.370]  Yeah.
[51:52.370 --> 51:54.790]  To be fair, I shoved the knife in his back.
[51:54.930 --> 51:55.750]  Yeah, and I got the knife.
[51:55.850 --> 51:57.070]  The knife was real good. Yeah.
[51:57.210 --> 51:59.730]  I got the salad cream covered knife in my back.
[52:04.450 --> 52:05.790]  Wait, it's not dark yet.
[52:06.010 --> 52:06.750]  It is not dark.
[52:07.210 --> 52:07.970]  Eric, turn your lights on.
[52:09.330 --> 52:12.090]  I gotta say that when we do them back to back,
[52:12.370 --> 52:15.490]  by about halfway through the second one, I do start to get tired.
[52:16.350 --> 52:18.930]  It is always your fault, though, that we do two back to back.
[52:19.030 --> 52:20.570]  It is my fault that we're doing two back to back.
[52:20.670 --> 52:21.110]  I apologize.
[52:21.110 --> 52:24.370]  I was ready. I was able to do one next Tuesday, but nobody wanted to.
[52:24.630 --> 52:27.150]  I don't think this was a bad episode. It was mind-blowing.
[52:27.410 --> 52:27.870]  It was mind-blowing.
[52:27.870 --> 52:30.590]  It was a mind-blowing episode, which I feel like is a good episode.
[52:30.790 --> 52:33.650]  I agree. I don't think this was bad at all. I think it was illuminating.
[52:34.130 --> 52:38.770]  I think it's episodes like this that give the audience a real taste of what it's been like
[52:38.770 --> 52:41.270]  for you and I to be friends with Andrew over these many years.
[52:41.310 --> 52:43.050]  Yeah, and it wasn't even like it was a letdown.
[52:43.270 --> 52:43.550]  No.
[52:43.710 --> 52:44.890]  It was a let sideways.
[52:45.470 --> 52:45.770]  Yes.
[52:46.550 --> 52:48.010]  It was a lateral let.
[52:48.130 --> 52:50.090]  It's kind of what it's like to be friends with Andrew.
[52:50.090 --> 52:52.890]  It's a lot of lateral movement, a lot of lateral things.
[52:53.030 --> 52:55.190]  Some might call it a sewing machine.
[52:55.890 --> 52:57.350]  Some might. I would.
[52:59.590 --> 53:00.430]  Oh, man.
[53:01.070 --> 53:02.870]  You know what else fucking sucks?
[53:03.370 --> 53:05.310]  I was talking about this with Andrew last night.
[53:08.270 --> 53:09.630]  I like what else?
[53:09.890 --> 53:11.950]  Yeah, what is the else, Geoff?
[53:12.010 --> 53:14.830]  Could you please specify on what the what is, maybe?
[53:15.130 --> 53:15.610]  What's what now?
[53:15.710 --> 53:17.130]  What is the thing that sucks?
[53:17.370 --> 53:18.450]  What is the comparative?
[53:18.770 --> 53:19.890]  Oh, let me tell you about it.
[53:19.890 --> 53:23.310]  How many fucking parallels they put in base cards these days?
[53:23.570 --> 53:24.170]  Oh, it's absurd.
[53:24.250 --> 53:28.810]  Gavin, I've been trying to collect this Peyton Pritchard rookie card, this Prism rookie card.
[53:28.930 --> 53:32.610]  You know how many parallel, how many different versions of this one card there are?
[53:32.770 --> 53:33.210]  Six.
[53:33.550 --> 53:33.930]  31.
[53:35.510 --> 53:37.090]  What, are they like different colored borders?
[53:37.310 --> 53:38.310]  They're different colored borders.
[53:38.590 --> 53:39.690]  You just described 31.
[53:39.810 --> 53:40.270]  Yeah, that's it.
[53:40.510 --> 53:40.850]  31.
[53:41.090 --> 53:41.810]  That's not interesting.
[53:42.170 --> 53:42.930]  Why do they do that?
[53:43.070 --> 53:43.870]  Because it's interesting.
[53:44.710 --> 53:47.430]  Because there are people like Geoff trying to buy all 31.
[53:47.910 --> 53:48.990]  Can you get a shiny?
[53:48.990 --> 53:52.330]  I gotta get all 31 flavors of this guy's fucking card, even though he's got a bad knee.
[53:52.510 --> 53:53.630]  Uh, yeah, they're all shiny.
[53:53.870 --> 53:54.990]  It's just a matter of how shiny.
[53:55.430 --> 53:59.050]  Anyway, I'm just frustrated by that because I'm not anywhere near as close as I thought I was.
[54:01.490 --> 54:01.850]  Okay.
[54:05.200 --> 54:06.660]  Got real quiet there for a second.
[54:06.780 --> 54:07.380]  Are you doing okay?
[54:10.120 --> 54:14.880]  I didn't realize my Peyton Pritchard Prism problems were a conversation killer.
[54:15.220 --> 54:16.060]  No, it wasn't even that.
[54:16.140 --> 54:18.100]  I just, I just looked down at myself.
[54:18.740 --> 54:21.760]  And I've just looked, I'm just like hot and sweaty.
[54:22.140 --> 54:23.720]  It's been a journey.
[54:24.100 --> 54:29.880]  From the salad cream test, I thought that my building was on fire an hour ago.
[54:30.560 --> 54:33.340]  It has been quite the back-to-back session.
[54:33.460 --> 54:34.440]  Although I'm very happy.
[54:34.520 --> 54:36.160]  Once again, I won the thing.
[54:36.220 --> 54:36.840]  How great is that?
[54:36.880 --> 54:38.100]  I can't wait to send that message.
[54:38.320 --> 54:41.640]  How great is it that you won the thing that you had engineered to win?
[54:42.580 --> 54:45.020]  Like there was any chance you weren't gonna win.
[54:46.040 --> 54:47.520]  Do you feel good about yourself, Andrew?
[54:48.100 --> 54:50.220]  I feel great about how that worked out.
[54:50.400 --> 54:53.380]  I thought, I thought you two would definitely just vote again.
[54:53.540 --> 54:54.860]  Because it's the biggest f*** face.
[54:55.320 --> 54:58.780]  I thought you would both do what would be the biggest f*** face for that scenario.
[54:59.220 --> 55:02.400]  Voting me to do the 300 immediately and not even letting me play.
[55:02.520 --> 55:05.680]  I was either gonna vote, I mean obviously I was either gonna vote Geoff or you,
[55:05.780 --> 55:08.120]  but I was thinking very heavily about voting for you.
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.060]  I just didn't think Geoff would.
[55:09.240 --> 55:12.560]  That's the other problem I had, Gavin, where I thought if I aligned with you,
[55:12.600 --> 55:14.120]  you've stabbed me in the back twice.
[55:14.500 --> 55:17.940]  If we have a three-way tie and I'm the only one that votes Geoff,
[55:17.940 --> 55:22.160]  you vote me, Geoff votes you, then you both absolutely vote me on the re-vote.
[55:22.580 --> 55:24.960]  So I had to, I felt it was safer to go with Geoff.
[55:25.180 --> 55:29.720]  And that would be my instinct for sure, but you swayed me in the 11th hour today
[55:29.720 --> 55:32.320]  by convincing me that Gavin's never been f*** faced.
[55:32.760 --> 55:35.560]  And that this was his time, which I got behind.
[55:35.920 --> 55:37.440]  That's not really true though, is it?
[55:37.580 --> 55:40.760]  Go cry in your mushroom sink. It must be so hard for you.
[55:44.840 --> 55:47.260]  I can't really remember any other good examples.
[55:47.940 --> 55:51.100]  That's not really a f*** face, that's just something that happened in my sink.
[55:51.280 --> 55:52.400]  Yeah, no shit, dude.
[55:53.660 --> 55:56.460]  You know where I am right now? I'm in my library.
[55:56.860 --> 56:01.760]  Where I wasn't for six months, next door to a bathroom I haven't used in five weeks.
[56:03.420 --> 56:04.960]  Yeah, I guess it's a fair comment.
[56:06.020 --> 56:09.280]  Yeah, I mean, this is, hey, now you get your shot.
[56:09.420 --> 56:11.620]  You got a knife in your back. That's the collectible knife.
[56:11.700 --> 56:13.100]  That's a 101 right there.
[56:13.100 --> 56:14.520]  I do enjoy that.
[56:16.860 --> 56:21.460]  And I feel like this went pretty well. This whole situation, I'm pretty happy with it.
[56:21.560 --> 56:23.760]  I'm sure you do.
[56:24.480 --> 56:25.180]  You're a winner.
[56:26.100 --> 56:28.940]  Yeah, I mean, I've lost every burger bet we've ever done.
[56:29.060 --> 56:32.320]  I think in this show, this is the first time I've ever come out on top.
[56:32.440 --> 56:33.660]  I don't know if calling me a winner.
[56:33.840 --> 56:36.320]  You've lost every court case you've ever been a part of.
[56:37.660 --> 56:38.540]  That is true.
[56:38.660 --> 56:40.360]  Every judgment's gone against you.
[56:40.940 --> 56:42.640]  I think outside of this.
[56:42.780 --> 56:47.620]  Well, no, I also just like if you fade me in gambling, you're going to do so good.
[56:47.740 --> 56:49.040]  Yeah, I'm not. I'm not a winner.
[56:49.140 --> 56:50.280]  That is an uncharacter.
[56:52.380 --> 56:54.180]  That is not an accurate comment.
[56:54.280 --> 56:56.840]  Um, I feel like for this episode, especially,
[56:56.940 --> 56:59.500]  I'd love to get our producers opinion on how this one went.
[56:59.980 --> 57:01.880]  I missed most of the first one.
[57:01.960 --> 57:07.680]  And I am more exhausted from this one than I am from our typical two shots.
[57:07.680 --> 57:13.320]  Like if someone were to ask me, Hey, did Andrew end up liking the salad cream?
[57:13.600 --> 57:14.900]  I would have to answer.
[57:15.120 --> 57:15.960]  I think so.
[57:16.420 --> 57:17.440]  But it's OK.
[57:17.580 --> 57:18.460]  But I'm not sure.
[57:18.680 --> 57:20.380]  It's fine. I feel like I was clear on that.
[57:20.460 --> 57:23.500]  Now, listen, I I'm I'm not for the comment leavers.
[57:23.600 --> 57:25.480]  I've made that clear, but I'm very excited.
[57:25.700 --> 57:31.120]  I'm very excited to see what everyone is going to have to say about whatever this episode is, man.
[57:31.380 --> 57:33.740]  I don't know. That sounds pretty pro comment leaver, Eric.
[57:33.740 --> 57:36.520]  For episode 39 of F*** Face, I'll say it.
[57:36.560 --> 57:37.600]  I'm pro comment leaver.
[57:38.980 --> 57:40.440]  So I don't know, man.
[57:40.620 --> 57:42.320]  This this one is out there.
[57:42.460 --> 57:43.720]  Geoff is just like it.
[57:43.920 --> 57:47.180]  Geoff is in like big spurts of not saying anything.
[57:47.480 --> 57:48.940]  It is so unusual.
[57:49.720 --> 57:51.840]  I like that Geoff went silent for like four minutes.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.320]  We went silent for 10 seconds and he was livid.
[57:55.140 --> 57:58.200]  Because there was still conversation flow going with you two idiots.
[57:58.540 --> 57:59.660]  I was silent listening.
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.760]  You guys were silent, sticking your fucking thumbs up your ass,
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.640]  waiting for Geoff to make people fucking laugh.
[58:04.900 --> 58:05.740]  God damn it.
[58:07.920 --> 58:08.720]  Fucking anus.
[58:08.860 --> 58:09.900]  I don't think I got an answer.
[58:10.240 --> 58:12.640]  Would either of you pick the child at any point?
[58:12.720 --> 58:13.700]  You didn't get an answer?
[58:15.420 --> 58:17.060]  Oh, you poor little boy.
[58:17.260 --> 58:19.880]  Oh, Andrew, please let us give you an answer.
[58:19.960 --> 58:21.060]  What would you like an answer on?
[58:21.480 --> 58:26.480]  Let us be clear and succinct so there's no ambiguity in the answer.
[58:26.740 --> 58:28.420]  What would you like an answer on, pal?
[58:28.900 --> 58:30.380]  Would you have kicked the kid?
[58:30.780 --> 58:31.040]  No!
[58:34.440 --> 58:35.640]  Oh, shit.
[58:36.120 --> 58:37.020]  You don't kick kids.
[58:39.380 --> 58:40.420]  Unless you're a kid.
[58:40.440 --> 58:41.300]  That's good life advice.
[58:41.640 --> 58:45.700]  The day you turn 18, you relinquish your ability to kick kids.
[58:48.500 --> 58:50.160]  So let's recap.
[58:52.340 --> 58:53.760]  Andrew, let's see.
[58:53.940 --> 58:55.020]  We picked a card.
[58:55.500 --> 58:56.800]  We don't know what it is.
[58:57.160 --> 59:00.060]  But you and the audience have known for a week.
[59:00.220 --> 59:00.980]  You're way more...
[59:00.980 --> 59:05.280]  This is the dumbest we'll ever be about our own podcast.
[59:05.960 --> 59:06.960]  Ever, probably.
[59:07.220 --> 59:08.640]  This moment in time right now.
[59:08.940 --> 59:12.540]  The entire world is smarter about us and our lives and our podcast than we are.
[59:12.760 --> 59:15.920]  We couldn't be further from smart than this fucking moment.
[59:16.140 --> 59:18.040]  I have no idea what we're collecting with Don Zimmer.
[59:18.520 --> 59:22.360]  We don't know if Andrew liked the fucking salad dressing or not.
[59:22.460 --> 59:22.840]  Nobody knows.
[59:23.240 --> 59:23.400]  I did.
[59:23.620 --> 59:24.460]  I did.
[59:24.820 --> 59:25.680]  I've said it so many times.
[59:25.680 --> 59:29.720]  We think Andrew might have been trying to admit to committing a crime.
[59:29.720 --> 59:33.100]  But then at the last second, he backed out and changed the narrative.
[59:33.400 --> 59:34.180]  Like, that's crazy.
[59:34.280 --> 59:34.860]  I didn't kick him.
[59:34.920 --> 59:35.860]  You would have kicked him though, right?
[59:35.920 --> 59:37.160]  I mean, I wouldn't have been crazy to kick him.
[59:37.380 --> 59:38.480]  Anybody would kick the kid, right?
[59:38.600 --> 59:39.600]  We would all kick the kid.
[59:39.740 --> 59:41.280]  Why wouldn't everybody else kick the kid?
[59:41.320 --> 59:42.360]  I mean, I didn't kick the kid.
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.500]  Obviously, Andrew kicked the kid and buried him in the woods.
[59:46.120 --> 59:47.460]  We got to get to the bottom of that.
[59:47.980 --> 59:48.840]  What else did we cut?
[59:48.840 --> 59:49.740]  What else happened this week?
[59:50.160 --> 59:53.840]  Oh, Andrew cheated the system and he has to sign his name once.
[59:54.700 --> 59:55.020]  What?
[59:55.880 --> 59:56.960]  Oh, I didn't cheat.
[59:57.100 --> 59:58.580]  That was luck.
[59:59.140 --> 59:59.680]  Natural luck.
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.680]  If podcasts could have thumbnails, this would be a nice salad on a table.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:08.740]  And then just a load of squirted out salad cream just on the floor in the street.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.240]  Geoff, you don't have a porta potty.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.260]  So be happy about that.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.040]  That's not, hey, you don't have that.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.720]  If you're a Canadian kid listening with a footprint on your solar plexus, feel free to write in.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.900]  He's kept the sweater as evidence.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.500]  Does your chest have a backwards Nike swoosh on it forever?
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:43.660]  Do your friends call you Waffle Peter because there's a waffle on your chest?
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.080]  Is your hip hop name Waffle Pee?
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.380]  Five stars.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.060]  Oh, my brain hurts.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.220]  Rate and review.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.380]  Or whatever.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.220]  Who cares?
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.180]  Buy a hat or don't.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.360]  Tune in next week.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.580]  Don't tune in next week.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.800]  Fucking throw your computer in the river.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:07.760]  I don't know.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.540]  Are the hats back on sale?
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:11.940]  I asked that before.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:12.580]  Are they back?
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.680]  I don't know if they're back yet.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.420]  This would be a great season finale.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.620]  We're taking a two week break, sort of.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.920]  So in a sense.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.820]  Tune in next week for season two.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.100]  What should the cliffhanger be?
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.160]  We got to end on a cliffhanger.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.620]  Gotta do this good season finale.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.180]  Uh, that's a great idea.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:36.820]  I'll here.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.660]  I'll start by, uh, I forgot.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.720]  I wanted to mention to you guys.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.520]  You will never believe what happened yet.
