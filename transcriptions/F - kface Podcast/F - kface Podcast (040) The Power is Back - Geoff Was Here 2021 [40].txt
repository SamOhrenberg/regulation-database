[00:00.640 --> 00:02.640]  This episode is brought to you by Corona.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.420]  When you're on a beach with an ice-cold Corona in hand,
[00:05.620 --> 00:06.860]  how can you not feel centered?
[00:07.080 --> 00:08.980]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[00:09.280 --> 00:12.320]  That's because whether after work, at barbecues or at a bar,
[00:12.540 --> 00:13.940]  with just a squeeze of lime,
[00:14.060 --> 00:16.160]  Corona brings you La Playa mentality.
[00:16.700 --> 00:18.480]  Because while we all want the beach life,
[00:18.780 --> 00:21.000]  paradise doesn't always have palm trees.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.440]  Corona. La Playa awaits.

[00:45.310 --> 00:49.330]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of F*** Face.
[00:49.850 --> 00:55.130]  As always, you are here with me, Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Free,
[00:55.310 --> 00:59.450]  and well, sir, how would you like me to address you?
[01:00.350 --> 01:04.190]  I'd like you to address me as the guy with the pinwheel still going.
[01:04.350 --> 01:05.370]  Still got my pinwheel.
[01:05.630 --> 01:06.770]  Are you not recording yet again?
[01:07.150 --> 01:08.730]  Oh, I'm trying. Okay, we're good.
[01:08.790 --> 01:09.370]  We're going. We're going.
[01:09.430 --> 01:10.330]  We're fine. We're fine.
[01:10.330 --> 01:12.130]  My feet know. I'm recording.
[01:12.570 --> 01:15.450]  I thought I gave him enough cover time by having that whole conversation
[01:15.450 --> 01:18.370]  about how I thought Gavin was in a bad mood just to piss Gavin off before...
[01:18.370 --> 01:20.210]  Yeah, Geoff insulted me a lot.
[01:20.350 --> 01:22.690]  And then, like, while I'm responding, saying,
[01:22.790 --> 01:24.530]  no, he starts the episode.
[01:25.730 --> 01:29.830]  He gave no ability for you to respond or to me to even say
[01:29.830 --> 01:32.390]  there's no way to judge Gavin's pre-show performance
[01:32.390 --> 01:34.630]  because he shows up on time, at the time.
[01:34.650 --> 01:36.270]  Yeah, there's very little to go on.
[01:36.330 --> 01:37.770]  There's no pre-show with Gavin.
[01:37.930 --> 01:40.050]  There's plenty of time when Gavin shows up on time
[01:40.050 --> 01:42.630]  that we're dealing with Andrew's technical issues
[01:42.630 --> 01:45.870]  where I can gauge Gavin's... I can gauge his mood.
[01:46.990 --> 01:52.010]  I've actually been thinking about moving on time to 01 of the hour
[01:52.010 --> 01:55.230]  just to give Andrew that extra minute that he's always wasting his life.
[01:56.670 --> 01:59.590]  I feel like the tech problems are a recent addition.
[01:59.750 --> 02:01.890]  And I feel like if you measured them against Geoff's,
[02:02.010 --> 02:04.290]  I've had less tech problems than Geoff has had.
[02:04.510 --> 02:06.090]  Yours are more constant, though.
[02:06.190 --> 02:09.390]  Geoff had, like, a construction project.
[02:09.390 --> 02:12.410]  But yours is just nothing over and over again.
[02:12.810 --> 02:15.730]  Yeah, mine was always tied to a reason, I feel like.
[02:15.930 --> 02:16.870]  Yours are just...
[02:16.870 --> 02:21.930]  I think we're forgetting where you had, like, 40 different microphones every single week.
[02:22.170 --> 02:25.190]  There was a whole phase where every week you had a different microphone.
[02:25.870 --> 02:26.670]  That's ancient history.
[02:26.810 --> 02:27.270]  It is.
[02:27.910 --> 02:31.590]  I thought we were going to have a little pre-show chat today.
[02:32.010 --> 02:33.330]  Just because it's been so long.
[02:33.390 --> 02:37.130]  It's been... well, we had the week off and then we had the apocalypse.
[02:37.750 --> 02:39.410]  I thought we would have a little bit of chat.
[02:39.610 --> 02:41.790]  Just, you know, see what was... we just went straight into it.
[02:41.850 --> 02:42.030]  All right.
[02:42.150 --> 02:43.690]  Well, here's why, dude.
[02:43.850 --> 02:46.590]  First off, let's have the pre-show chat now.
[02:47.690 --> 02:48.370]  In the show?
[02:48.830 --> 02:49.230]  Yeah, sure.
[02:49.230 --> 02:49.590]  After the intro.
[02:49.810 --> 02:49.950]  Okay.
[02:50.190 --> 02:50.590]  After the intro.
[02:50.650 --> 02:50.790]  Why?
[02:50.910 --> 02:51.650]  We'll have our pre...
[02:51.650 --> 02:52.370]  Here's the way.
[02:52.590 --> 02:54.630]  Audience, we're going to give you a peer behind the veil.
[02:54.970 --> 02:57.490]  This is what a typical pre-show chat looks like.
[02:58.210 --> 03:00.570]  But as we warm up for an episode of F*** Face.
[03:00.710 --> 03:04.290]  But also, a caveat I would say is that I tried to have a pre-show chat with you
[03:04.290 --> 03:06.090]  and you were having none of it because you were in a shitty mood.
[03:08.130 --> 03:09.310]  That's not true.
[03:09.650 --> 03:14.170]  I would like to say that technically I was the only one on time today for the first recording
[03:14.170 --> 03:17.830]  session. I was here at five and nobody else was.
[03:18.070 --> 03:18.130]  All right.
[03:18.570 --> 03:19.390]  Very disappointed.
[03:19.710 --> 03:21.790]  That brings up one annoying point that we need to cover.
[03:22.030 --> 03:23.970]  And so here's what I feel like we need to do.
[03:24.370 --> 03:31.150]  I'm going to set the pre-show chat aside for a second because Andrew's gone off on a bit of a
[03:31.150 --> 03:31.430]  tangent.
[03:31.710 --> 03:32.610]  No, I was pre-show.
[03:32.610 --> 03:37.690]  We need to address, obviously, Andrew's revelation during the downtime.
[03:38.530 --> 03:47.010]  We need to talk about, in some fashion, Austin's technical problems for about eight days there
[03:47.010 --> 03:47.710]  because of snow.
[03:48.210 --> 03:50.870]  I hurt myself real bad.
[03:51.110 --> 03:52.310]  I wouldn't mind talking about that.
[03:53.070 --> 03:58.690]  And maybe we could even mention the Zimzone and what an... that thing has gone insane.
[03:59.430 --> 04:02.470]  I did not expect that much response that quickly.
[04:02.470 --> 04:03.490]  On the Zimzone.
[04:04.430 --> 04:06.970]  But first off, Gav, how you been, man?
[04:07.690 --> 04:09.110]  I've noticed you've been in a bad mood lately.
[04:09.290 --> 04:10.970]  Is everything okay at home with you and Meg?
[04:13.450 --> 04:14.550]  Andrew, what's up, dude?
[04:14.850 --> 04:20.610]  Hey, I showed up at 5 a.m. because we're incapable of organizing anything properly.
[04:20.830 --> 04:21.370]  Oh, what a deflection.
[04:21.630 --> 04:24.890]  And Geoff sent like 20 different... is this not what you wanted?
[04:24.950 --> 04:26.230]  I could pivot back to you if you want.
[04:26.310 --> 04:26.750]  We could do that.
[04:27.190 --> 04:27.490]  No, no, no, it was great.
[04:27.570 --> 04:28.630]  I was just saying I got away with it.
[04:28.710 --> 04:29.630]  I was just saying that to myself.
[04:30.010 --> 04:30.590]  Yeah, no, that was...
[04:30.590 --> 04:31.150]  So what happened?
[04:31.150 --> 04:32.770]  You and Meg broke up or something?
[04:32.870 --> 04:33.450]  Is that what's going on?
[04:33.710 --> 04:33.890]  No.
[04:34.030 --> 04:34.690]  Are you announcing it here?
[04:37.510 --> 04:39.030]  Why do you keep bringing it back to me?
[04:39.370 --> 04:40.010]  I don't know.
[04:40.910 --> 04:44.590]  I think that the reason I sound low energy is it's very early morning and...
[04:45.570 --> 04:46.230]  It's early morning.
[04:46.590 --> 04:46.990]  Cold...
[04:46.990 --> 04:47.730]  It's noon!
[04:48.850 --> 04:51.070]  Well, early... I know it's not actually the morning.
[04:51.470 --> 04:53.370]  It's earlier than our usual 3 p.m.
[04:53.550 --> 04:53.910]  It is.
[04:54.190 --> 04:57.030]  And my house hasn't warmed up yet for the day.
[04:57.410 --> 04:59.490]  And it was a bit cold in the old bedroom last night.
[04:59.490 --> 05:02.550]  And I got a bit of, like, morning throat from it.
[05:02.930 --> 05:06.850]  Oh, and you're moving a little slow from sleeping cold.
[05:06.970 --> 05:09.230]  Yeah, I got a bask. I'm like a reptile.
[05:09.510 --> 05:12.730]  Yeah, I understand why you're feeling so shitty now.
[05:12.890 --> 05:15.110]  What you need, I prescribed to you, sir,
[05:15.630 --> 05:18.850]  20 minutes in your lawn chair in the backyard soaking up sun.
[05:19.110 --> 05:20.830]  That's it. That's what Gavin needs to feel better.
[05:21.050 --> 05:21.450]  I love that.
[05:21.550 --> 05:23.030]  Did you ever see me doing that when I lived with you?
[05:23.110 --> 05:23.910]  I used to do that all the time.
[05:24.090 --> 05:26.030]  That's why I prescribed it to you, because I know that's...
[05:26.030 --> 05:27.470]  I know you physically...
[05:27.470 --> 05:30.230]  Like, I physically need to ride a bike like five or six times a week.
[05:30.450 --> 05:33.570]  I think you physically need to recharge your batteries in the sun.
[05:34.290 --> 05:35.310]  Get that D.
[05:35.790 --> 05:37.030]  Yeah, you love your D.
[05:37.270 --> 05:38.350]  Did I tell you why I stopped?
[05:38.390 --> 05:40.330]  You remember when we lived in that rental house?
[05:41.190 --> 05:42.910]  I used to do that in the...
[05:42.910 --> 05:44.950]  There wasn't really a backyard, but there was a front.
[05:45.470 --> 05:47.970]  Yeah, it was a bit awkward because people walking by all the time.
[05:48.010 --> 05:50.550]  But I would just sit in the front yard, soaking up the sun.
[05:50.890 --> 05:52.250]  Did I ever tell you why I stopped that?
[05:52.570 --> 05:53.570]  No, I don't think so.
[05:54.510 --> 05:56.030]  Someone... I'm convinced of it.
[05:56.270 --> 05:58.050]  Someone threw a tree branch at my head.
[05:59.850 --> 06:00.290]  What?
[06:00.630 --> 06:06.030]  Okay, either a branch snapped out of the tree and landed on my forehead and it really hurt.
[06:06.550 --> 06:06.650]  Correct.
[06:06.890 --> 06:13.310]  Or you threw a tree branch at me from a window and hid and never admitted to it.
[06:14.190 --> 06:16.230]  Or some member of the public did it.
[06:16.350 --> 06:18.090]  I have no idea, but I had...
[06:18.090 --> 06:21.590]  That was the last time I ever laid out in the sun at that location.
[06:21.730 --> 06:23.230]  Why would a member of the public do that?
[06:23.230 --> 06:24.970]  All right, full disclosure.
[06:25.450 --> 06:30.890]  I have no memory of throwing a tree branch out of the window at you.
[06:32.230 --> 06:35.690]  But I can absolutely see myself doing that.
[06:36.450 --> 06:42.850]  I thought... I was very confused, but I thought it wasn't you because it was such a big branch.
[06:42.970 --> 06:45.410]  I thought that's a little extreme even for Geoff.
[06:45.470 --> 06:49.450]  I would have thought maybe like a ball of socks or something just to get a reaction.
[06:49.810 --> 06:53.210]  I didn't think you would go for like the drawing blood out of my forehead approach.
[06:53.230 --> 06:54.590]  I probably wouldn't have.
[06:54.810 --> 06:57.030]  So maybe it was just a tree branch fell.
[06:57.930 --> 06:59.030]  That's also possible.
[06:59.410 --> 07:03.870]  You interpreted that as someone threw a tree branch at you out of all the outcomes you described.
[07:04.010 --> 07:05.210]  OK, well, where's the nearest tree?
[07:05.710 --> 07:06.870]  Is there a tree close by?
[07:07.110 --> 07:08.450]  Hold on. I'd like to point out.
[07:08.490 --> 07:14.090]  I'd like to point out that this is coming from the man who, because he spoke to a little boy
[07:14.090 --> 07:17.330]  and the boy didn't respond three times, he was ready to kick his chest.
[07:17.470 --> 07:18.030]  No, it was.
[07:18.170 --> 07:19.530]  There was really dark out.
[07:19.590 --> 07:20.730]  I couldn't see anything.
[07:20.950 --> 07:21.930]  It was very creepy.
[07:21.930 --> 07:24.630]  Gavin probably couldn't see anything but stars for a few minutes.
[07:26.690 --> 07:30.870]  I just feel like it's a leap to blame the tree last, like of all the suspect.
[07:31.090 --> 07:31.850]  Well, I guess you would.
[07:32.070 --> 07:33.910]  Honestly, you'd probably be number one on my list.
[07:33.970 --> 07:35.070]  And then I'd move past that.
[07:35.150 --> 07:39.010]  I'd never guess a random person threw a fucking tree at me.
[07:39.350 --> 07:42.190]  I don't think it was a random person just because of the neighborhood we were in
[07:42.190 --> 07:43.510]  and the area we were in.
[07:43.650 --> 07:46.430]  Yeah, that seems that seems a little random for that.
[07:46.510 --> 07:47.790]  For that boring ass neighborhood.
[07:47.790 --> 07:51.730]  We were in there, Gav, of old people wearing Birkenstocks and fucking talking to you about
[07:51.730 --> 07:52.730]  somebody else's garden.
[07:54.150 --> 07:56.650]  But but I would say there's a 50 50 shot.
[07:56.750 --> 07:57.790]  It was me or the tree.
[07:58.470 --> 08:03.270]  I guess you just what you just have to figure out what who you pissed off more that day.
[08:03.590 --> 08:04.810]  It just didn't match anything.
[08:05.250 --> 08:07.690]  The branch didn't match the tree that I was near.
[08:10.070 --> 08:12.730]  In my head, it definitely came from someone's hair.
[08:14.070 --> 08:16.630]  Maybe they just took a dislike to what I was doing.
[08:16.890 --> 08:20.830]  Well, OK, so let's assume this was someone who threw it.
[08:20.830 --> 08:21.590]  Wasn't Geoff.
[08:21.990 --> 08:23.790]  They just have this branch with them.
[08:23.970 --> 08:25.510]  What were their plans with the branch?
[08:25.610 --> 08:26.950]  Was this a calculated move?
[08:27.010 --> 08:27.830]  You did this a lot.
[08:27.970 --> 08:28.670]  Maybe they were waiting.
[08:29.350 --> 08:31.910]  There are a lot of questions about who just has a branch.
[08:32.390 --> 08:36.390]  Maybe they were trying to start like the new viral hate crime.
[08:36.590 --> 08:39.830]  You know how like in New York City, people were punching people in the back of the head
[08:39.830 --> 08:43.750]  for a while or like, you know, people throw eggs out of cars and people walking around
[08:43.750 --> 08:44.130]  downtown.
[08:44.350 --> 08:49.330]  Maybe maybe somebody was trying to do like the new viral like hate thing, which is to
[08:49.330 --> 08:51.390]  throw a tree branch at somebody sunning.
[08:51.490 --> 08:53.250]  And it's just it just didn't take off.
[08:53.310 --> 08:56.830]  I thought I was breaking some American custom of some sort.
[08:56.890 --> 08:59.130]  I don't even in the country for a year.
[08:59.310 --> 09:01.490]  I thought maybe it's maybe it's rude to do this.
[09:01.930 --> 09:02.710]  It is absolutely not.
[09:02.910 --> 09:03.530]  It is not rude.
[09:03.730 --> 09:05.250]  We need to talk about the 5 a.m. thing.
[09:05.550 --> 09:08.170]  Well, yeah, are we still is it is this still the pre-show chat or not?
[09:08.610 --> 09:13.350]  Well, I don't know what the qualify that as I also don't think it matters at all.
[09:13.610 --> 09:16.610]  But well, I'd like to pivot away from the pre-show chat.
[09:16.610 --> 09:21.230]  I don't feel like the 5 a.m. thing is part of that.
[09:21.430 --> 09:22.130]  OK, that's fair.
[09:22.230 --> 09:22.410]  That's part.
[09:22.590 --> 09:27.010]  But I will say I'm a little confused as to how you got up and showed up for the 5 a.m.
[09:27.050 --> 09:29.790]  recording when it was never supposed to be today.
[09:30.330 --> 09:36.810]  What happened was what happened was we were supposed to record every Thursday at 3 p.m.
[09:37.070 --> 09:39.370]  Eric asked if we wanted to do two episodes this week.
[09:39.590 --> 09:42.070]  I thought we said, no, we just wanted to do one.
[09:42.490 --> 09:45.550]  There was all kinds of confusion on my part about whether we were doing
[09:45.990 --> 09:49.070]  whether we said no to two or we said no to back to back.
[09:49.310 --> 09:51.690]  But it seemed to me like y'all wanted to do two.
[09:51.830 --> 09:53.030]  So I was like, fuck it, we'll do two.
[09:53.330 --> 09:58.170]  So I know that Andrew and myself were keen on on getting to some stuff earlier in the week,
[09:58.210 --> 09:59.950]  just because we missed last week's one.
[10:00.190 --> 10:00.950]  For sure. Absolutely.
[10:01.010 --> 10:02.310]  And I totally understand that.
[10:02.430 --> 10:04.490]  So then we determined to film.
[10:05.350 --> 10:09.970]  Eric gave us three possible slots, one today at noon right now.
[10:10.570 --> 10:14.710]  The only problem there was that Eric and Nick wouldn't be able to attend.
[10:14.710 --> 10:16.990]  And I wasn't a fan of that one. That was my least favorite option.
[10:17.330 --> 10:19.090]  Gavin was not a fan of that one. Neither was I.
[10:19.590 --> 10:22.650]  Gavin suggested 5 a.m. Wednesday, which is tomorrow.
[10:22.930 --> 10:26.470]  Well, Eric said, I said, when's the next time we can all be together?
[10:26.730 --> 10:28.350]  Eric said early on Wednesday.
[10:28.710 --> 10:31.390]  So in my head, early is like five in the morning.
[10:31.550 --> 10:33.370]  So I just threw out 5 a.m.
[10:33.370 --> 10:35.470]  Eric said, no, I was thinking like 10.
[10:35.890 --> 10:39.410]  Now, so 10 a.m. doesn't work for me on Wednesday, unfortunately.
[10:40.510 --> 10:42.850]  So but Eric and Nick are both available.
[10:42.850 --> 10:47.050]  So Eric and Nick are available for 10 a.m. on Wednesday or 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
[10:47.730 --> 10:48.990]  Gavin's available for all of it.
[10:49.250 --> 10:50.170]  Andrew was the one.
[10:50.410 --> 10:52.290]  It sounded to me like we were going to do 5 a.m. Wednesday.
[10:52.370 --> 10:56.210]  But then Andrew said he would have to whisper for some reason.
[10:56.430 --> 10:58.050]  And so 3 a.m. for Andrew.
[10:58.130 --> 10:59.310]  Yeah, it would be 3 a.m.
[10:59.310 --> 11:01.090]  And I don't live in my own house.
[11:01.650 --> 11:03.230]  Sure, sure, sure. I understand that.
[11:03.450 --> 11:08.550]  If only you could if only you could give them that same courtesy when it came to fire alarms.
[11:09.390 --> 11:09.970]  I agree.
[11:09.970 --> 11:15.410]  However, so somehow it was determined that the least favorite day of everybody,
[11:15.570 --> 11:17.510]  which is right now, is the day that we're recording.
[11:18.910 --> 11:23.450]  But for some reason, Andrew was one of you wanted to record a 5 a.m. last night?
[11:23.750 --> 11:23.870]  No.
[11:24.070 --> 11:24.390]  Yeah.
[11:24.410 --> 11:28.950]  So he showed up at 5 a.m. today for some reason when it was never a part of the conversation.
[11:29.190 --> 11:32.610]  This is this is what you explain that in a way that made sense.
[11:32.870 --> 11:35.810]  There were times flying left and right different days.
[11:35.850 --> 11:36.530]  You could do this.
[11:36.690 --> 11:38.250]  You're like, maybe we'll do it this time.
[11:38.330 --> 11:38.950]  Maybe we won't.
[11:38.990 --> 11:39.510]  I don't know.
[11:39.510 --> 11:40.990]  It was super confusing.
[11:41.250 --> 11:42.510]  I don't trust anybody.
[11:42.730 --> 11:48.670]  So I said, I'm showing up at every suggested time between now and the last day,
[11:48.750 --> 11:49.990]  which would have been, I guess, Thursday.
[11:50.430 --> 11:51.930]  So I'm covering all my bases.
[11:52.510 --> 11:53.650]  So I showed up at 5 a.m.
[11:53.670 --> 11:55.070]  Yesterday was never discussed.
[11:55.350 --> 11:56.670]  Yeah, I don't know about that.
[11:58.190 --> 12:02.930]  Geoff refused to reply to the calendar invite until about when did you say?
[12:03.010 --> 12:05.490]  Because it was you put it in as a maybe on the calendar.
[12:05.550 --> 12:06.950]  Yeah, which to me is the most useless.
[12:07.110 --> 12:08.710]  That's the exact same as not responding.
[12:08.710 --> 12:10.210]  Yeah, it is.
[12:10.370 --> 12:14.210]  No, it's better than not responding because it's saying, yes, I am aware.
[12:14.670 --> 12:16.410]  I know that a time needs to be.
[12:16.810 --> 12:18.610]  I understand that there's an appointment.
[12:19.070 --> 12:20.750]  I'm just not going to tell you whether I'm going or not.
[12:20.810 --> 12:21.970]  But at least, you know, I know.
[12:22.090 --> 12:23.730]  As opposed to not responding.
[12:23.790 --> 12:25.890]  You think like, well, maybe he just didn't see the invite.
[12:26.070 --> 12:27.670]  No, I saw the inbounding.
[12:27.750 --> 12:28.970]  It's like I'm probably going to be there.
[12:28.990 --> 12:30.090]  I just haven't hit accept.
[12:30.330 --> 12:33.150]  Maybe it's like there's a solid chance I won't be there.
[12:33.310 --> 12:35.430]  There was a solid chance I wasn't going to be here for sure.
[12:35.430 --> 12:38.250]  Well, I need to get into.
[12:38.470 --> 12:39.990]  So I did the five.
[12:40.110 --> 12:44.150]  I was the only one here at five because apparently nobody else even considered it on this day.
[12:44.270 --> 12:45.150]  You weren't here at five.
[12:45.270 --> 12:47.630]  I was I was in here for 30 minutes at five.
[12:47.730 --> 12:50.510]  And I thought, well, it's three a.m.
[12:50.630 --> 12:52.210]  What am I going to wake up at three a.m.?
[12:52.210 --> 12:53.790]  So I stayed up the entire night.
[12:53.910 --> 12:55.210]  I didn't go to bed until four.
[12:56.050 --> 13:02.050]  I then developed an irrational fear after all of our alarm talk that I would somehow sleep
[13:02.050 --> 13:02.890]  through the alarm.
[13:02.890 --> 13:05.450]  I woke up at 620 a.m.
[13:05.490 --> 13:08.670]  And I said, I'm not going to sleep through an alarm in a bathtub.
[13:08.970 --> 13:09.890]  I went to my tub.
[13:10.090 --> 13:12.690]  I spent the next three hours sleeping in my bathtub.
[13:13.070 --> 13:14.430]  I slept in my bathtub this morning.
[13:14.750 --> 13:17.270]  You can't just say stuff like that as if it's normal.
[13:17.710 --> 13:21.690]  So wait, you wanted to be deliberately uncomfortable in a light sleep.
[13:21.950 --> 13:22.150]  Yeah.
[13:22.370 --> 13:23.370]  So you slept in the bath.
[13:23.910 --> 13:24.130]  Yeah.
[13:24.270 --> 13:29.350]  I thought there was no way I would be comfy enough to sleep through an alarm in my bathtub.
[13:29.550 --> 13:30.630]  So I just moved to the tub.
[13:30.730 --> 13:31.470]  I spent three.
[13:31.530 --> 13:32.090]  It was awful.
[13:32.090 --> 13:33.270]  A terrible sleep.
[13:33.470 --> 13:34.150]  Would not recommend.
[13:34.910 --> 13:35.930]  I'm super tired.
[13:37.370 --> 13:47.590]  I think if you had only read the slack one more time, you could have saved yourself a lot of hassle.
[13:47.810 --> 13:48.810]  It was very confusing.
[13:49.290 --> 13:54.350]  Oh, did you think it was tonight because I showed a screenshot of me setting an alarm for 4 a.m.?
[13:54.350 --> 13:56.010]  That was, you know what?
[13:56.050 --> 13:58.590]  I thought that you would be there based on that.
[13:58.650 --> 14:00.150]  That was a factor.
[14:00.150 --> 14:03.130]  So as a joke, I turned on one of my early alarms.
[14:03.850 --> 14:06.930]  I think 4.45 and I just sent the screenshot.
[14:07.630 --> 14:10.670]  But I just turned that off immediately afterwards because it was the wrong day.
[14:11.030 --> 14:12.430]  Yeah, I didn't. I didn't interpret them right.
[14:12.530 --> 14:15.290]  And then I got sick about the way I do my alarms.
[14:15.490 --> 14:16.450]  Oh, it's ridiculous.
[14:18.050 --> 14:19.830]  Listen, we're getting off on.
[14:19.950 --> 14:22.410]  So we're we're we're tangenting on our tangent right now.
[14:22.650 --> 14:23.450]  But I got it.
[14:23.550 --> 14:24.230]  I know it's OK.
[14:24.290 --> 14:25.450]  I got to back you up on that.
[14:25.470 --> 14:27.650]  And I swear to you, there's an off topic.
[14:28.170 --> 14:34.750]  Years ago or an RT podcast where either you or Gus made fun of me for having a million alarms
[14:34.750 --> 14:37.590]  and not just editing the existing alarm.
[14:37.750 --> 14:38.350]  Yeah, I don't know.
[14:38.410 --> 14:39.710]  I don't know when I started doing that.
[14:39.830 --> 14:41.390]  It could have been you that put me onto it.
[14:41.450 --> 14:43.650]  But it turns out there's two types of people.
[14:44.130 --> 14:47.470]  There's alarm adders and alarm editors.
[14:48.190 --> 14:52.610]  I'm an alarm adder because you need different times for different days for different days of the week.
[14:52.890 --> 14:54.910]  Like if I have to be up at 6 a.m. every Wednesday,
[14:55.090 --> 14:57.030]  then I'm going to set an alarm for 6 a.m. every Wednesday.
[14:57.650 --> 15:01.150]  So what I've got is on my alarms page in the iPhone,
[15:01.630 --> 15:04.290]  I've just got a list of every alarm I've ever set.
[15:04.550 --> 15:06.250]  And to set an alarm, I just scroll down.
[15:06.550 --> 15:08.330]  It's very rare that I add one now.
[15:08.610 --> 15:10.470]  But I've just got every alarm I've ever needed.
[15:10.610 --> 15:12.870]  There's probably like 40 different alarm times.
[15:13.190 --> 15:14.550]  And I just scroll and pick it.
[15:14.570 --> 15:17.590]  Because in my head at the time, to edit the alarm on the iPhone,
[15:17.750 --> 15:21.310]  you've got to edit it and then fart about with that stupid wheel.
[15:21.610 --> 15:22.690]  You don't do the wheel anymore.
[15:22.750 --> 15:23.630]  You just type the number in.
[15:23.950 --> 15:24.910]  Yeah, I guess it's...
[15:24.910 --> 15:26.250]  I mean, I haven't done it in a long time.
[15:26.250 --> 15:29.510]  But to me, having a shitload of alarms is a lot quicker than
[15:29.510 --> 15:32.450]  manually editing one alarm every single time.
[15:32.670 --> 15:33.490]  Not when you put it in.
[15:33.750 --> 15:37.110]  At this point, I would say you're spending way more time cycling through
[15:37.110 --> 15:40.270]  your fucking 80 alarms to try to find the one that relates to you.
[15:40.510 --> 15:41.490]  You're at a loss here.
[15:41.730 --> 15:43.390]  Comment leavers, let us know in the comments.
[15:43.710 --> 15:46.050]  Are you an alarm editor or an alarm adder?
[15:46.890 --> 15:49.610]  So we determined that...
[15:51.330 --> 15:53.590]  You know, you could be a hybrid too, now that I think about it.
[15:53.590 --> 15:56.430]  I probably have about 25 alarms.
[15:56.630 --> 15:59.450]  And I'd say I edit them about half the time.
[15:59.670 --> 16:04.070]  Like, sometimes it's easier just to change an alarm from 545 to 530
[16:04.070 --> 16:05.790]  than it is to go create a 530 alarm.
[16:06.250 --> 16:07.330]  You don't ever do that?
[16:07.970 --> 16:08.270]  No.
[16:08.750 --> 16:10.390]  I probably do about... I probably do 50-50.
[16:10.890 --> 16:11.770]  No, I've got so many.
[16:11.910 --> 16:13.890]  Like, some is like, I've got 6am.
[16:14.330 --> 16:16.150]  One is like 6.01am.
[16:18.370 --> 16:21.950]  If you needed to get up at 6.01am, why not just turn on the 6am alarm?
[16:22.390 --> 16:23.610]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[16:23.930 --> 16:25.690]  That's that's me. That's my bathtub.
[16:25.850 --> 16:29.530]  That's me making sure I don't sleep through the 6am by putting another one at 6.01am.
[16:29.530 --> 16:30.470]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[16:30.610 --> 16:33.790]  As we were talking about this, I realized it would have been a much better strategy
[16:33.790 --> 16:36.990]  to just add a second alarm or a third alarm to make sure
[16:36.990 --> 16:39.170]  instead of sleeping in a tub for three hours.
[16:39.830 --> 16:43.750]  So we wanted to rush the recording of this podcast out early.
[16:44.650 --> 16:48.610]  And then, as Andrew mentioned, it became a whole kerfuffle in times.
[16:48.610 --> 16:51.890]  And this was the least exciting time.
[16:52.090 --> 16:55.330]  So for some reason, we're doing it without Eric, who I would love to have been here.
[16:55.330 --> 16:56.350]  There's a reason for that.
[16:56.650 --> 16:57.970]  Who I would love to have been here.
[16:58.130 --> 16:58.930]  I know. Don't get me wrong.
[16:59.030 --> 17:00.650]  Ben is here and I'm happy to have been here.
[17:00.950 --> 17:06.010]  But you, Andrew, made the startling revelation that was such a big deal
[17:06.010 --> 17:09.150]  that we determined we needed to record the podcast early to address it.
[17:09.250 --> 17:12.250]  Like to point out, we're now 25 minutes into that podcast
[17:12.250 --> 17:17.070]  and we're talking about alarms and our pre-show conversation
[17:17.490 --> 17:18.870]  and Gavin's bad mood.
[17:19.170 --> 17:21.950]  But at no point, Gavin get...
[17:22.850 --> 17:25.810]  Maybe I may or may not have assaulted Gavin with a tree branch.
[17:26.010 --> 17:27.990]  I like that you genuinely don't know.
[17:28.690 --> 17:29.470]  I really don't.
[17:29.550 --> 17:32.950]  But I mean, it definitely sounds like if you had a video of me doing it,
[17:33.010 --> 17:34.590]  I'd go like, yeah, I guess I remember that.
[17:34.790 --> 17:35.250]  But I don't.
[17:37.990 --> 17:39.990]  Anyway, the point being, if we're...
[17:39.990 --> 17:42.970]  If it's such a big goddamn deal for us to record two days early,
[17:43.690 --> 17:44.870]  should we talk about it?
[17:44.870 --> 17:47.770]  Well, I think before we get into that, Geoff,
[17:47.990 --> 17:52.010]  is there's a reason that we're recording early that you're not aware of.
[17:52.310 --> 17:52.850]  Oh, OK.
[17:53.090 --> 17:54.070]  Yeah, so let's go...
[17:54.910 --> 17:55.990]  Well, first of all...
[17:55.990 --> 17:57.910]  Can I point out, if you're about to...
[17:58.570 --> 18:01.030]  If this is about to be some sort of a prank on me,
[18:01.510 --> 18:03.810]  can I just say, I don't have to get into the story.
[18:04.190 --> 18:07.890]  I am in a tremendously disadvantaged physical state.
[18:08.110 --> 18:08.370]  Yeah.
[18:08.930 --> 18:11.110]  It is very difficult for me to move.
[18:11.270 --> 18:14.490]  The left side of my body is in excruciating pain.
[18:15.150 --> 18:17.850]  And my hands are pretty fucked up.
[18:18.410 --> 18:20.090]  So don't make me...
[18:21.630 --> 18:23.550]  Don't make me lift anything heavy.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.590]  And why do I have a voicemail?
[18:25.830 --> 18:27.450]  I... do you have a voicemail?
[18:27.710 --> 18:30.670]  I just got a phone call from an Austin number and they left a voicemail.
[18:30.770 --> 18:31.310]  Is this you?
[18:31.610 --> 18:32.450]  What's the voicemail say?
[18:32.810 --> 18:33.690]  That might be me.
[18:34.810 --> 18:35.210]  OK.
[18:35.290 --> 18:36.230]  Can you play it over Discord?
[18:36.670 --> 18:37.250]  Well, hold on.
[18:37.290 --> 18:38.750]  That might be my lunch or Millie's lunch.
[18:38.850 --> 18:39.050]  Hold on.
[18:39.130 --> 18:40.010]  I'll be right back.
[18:41.210 --> 18:41.990]  Talk amongst yourselves.
[18:42.370 --> 18:42.590]  OK.
[18:42.710 --> 18:43.470]  What am I looking for?
[18:43.890 --> 18:44.870]  It's going to be...
[18:44.870 --> 18:47.930]  It's a thing for me to get out of a chair and get back into it right now.
[18:48.230 --> 18:49.430]  So do I need to get up?
[18:50.010 --> 18:51.230]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:51.950 --> 18:55.650]  Well, I guess before we get into that, people very upset.
[18:55.790 --> 18:56.870]  We're doing a lot of pivots.
[18:58.150 --> 19:00.370]  People upset about disappointed in the porta potty.
[19:00.470 --> 19:01.490]  Do you want to share the porta potty?
[19:01.510 --> 19:02.550]  You got your porta potty check.
[19:02.890 --> 19:03.730]  I got my porta potty.
[19:03.830 --> 19:05.030]  Didn't I do that on camera?
[19:05.070 --> 19:05.970]  I thought we were in an episode.
[19:06.150 --> 19:07.370]  No, that was off camera.
[19:07.750 --> 19:08.670]  Oh, yeah, I got...
[19:08.670 --> 19:09.710]  You sent me a porta potty.
[19:09.870 --> 19:10.210]  I did.
[19:10.370 --> 19:10.650]  Explain.
[19:11.250 --> 19:12.110]  It's a little...
[19:12.510 --> 19:15.210]  Uh, we were we were talking when it happened.
[19:15.330 --> 19:16.670]  So was it before or after an episode?
[19:16.810 --> 19:18.610]  I guess you were in a picture of it.
[19:18.690 --> 19:19.370]  You just text it.
[19:19.790 --> 19:20.270]  Oh, I guess so.
[19:20.310 --> 19:21.550]  I thought I was talking to Andrew when it happened.
[19:21.710 --> 19:22.410]  No, I guess I wasn't.
[19:22.630 --> 19:28.690]  Um, it's a it's a little matchbook matchbox dump truck kind of thing.
[19:28.990 --> 19:31.350]  That's carrying two little blue porta potties.
[19:31.530 --> 19:32.150]  I'll put it.
[19:32.430 --> 19:32.750]  There it is.
[19:32.770 --> 19:33.470]  Yeah, that's it right there.
[19:33.710 --> 19:34.550]  The Poop King.
[19:35.050 --> 19:35.870]  It's very cute.
[19:36.370 --> 19:37.890]  It's a very cute delivery.
[19:38.510 --> 19:39.990]  Yeah, it's called the Poop King.
[19:40.050 --> 19:41.150]  It's called the Poop King.
[19:41.210 --> 19:41.930]  It's a great name.
[19:41.930 --> 19:43.150]  It's a great matchbox car.
[19:43.670 --> 19:45.250]  People are just really disappointed.
[19:45.910 --> 19:46.770]  Or some people were.
[19:46.870 --> 19:47.090]  I don't know.
[19:47.170 --> 19:49.370]  Some people, I think, were confused by the whole thing.
[19:50.490 --> 19:52.270]  But I felt like I had to deliver.
[19:52.430 --> 19:54.310]  So I got you got you that porta potty.
[19:54.550 --> 19:55.150]  I love it, dude.
[19:55.210 --> 19:58.950]  I have it sitting on my desk right next to my sweet pickles van.
[19:59.270 --> 19:59.730]  Oh, really?
[20:00.170 --> 20:00.990]  Yeah, that's great.
[20:01.030 --> 20:05.690]  I'm glad you love it because the real thing is going to arrive like this week.
[20:05.790 --> 20:07.330]  I think I don't need it, dude.
[20:07.330 --> 20:11.530]  I have A, I have working bathrooms now and B.
[20:12.010 --> 20:13.830]  Well, that's just it's inconvenient.
[20:14.070 --> 20:15.550]  You told me that it would take months.
[20:15.690 --> 20:16.750]  I was trying to be a good friend.
[20:17.610 --> 20:21.810]  Probably needs to go to another disadvantaged family in Austin right now
[20:21.810 --> 20:24.930]  who might not have plumbing considering everything they've gone through.
[20:25.050 --> 20:25.950]  Well, oh, it's pink.
[20:26.270 --> 20:28.390]  It's yeah, it's it's a beautiful.
[20:28.590 --> 20:30.690]  It's a beautiful pink porta potty.
[20:31.170 --> 20:32.030]  He's son of a bitch.
[20:32.070 --> 20:32.930]  I ordered this.
[20:33.190 --> 20:33.270]  You.
[20:33.490 --> 20:35.450]  I ordered it three weeks ago.
[20:36.070 --> 20:38.830]  Before we recorded the double episodes, I ordered this.
[20:38.930 --> 20:39.070]  Yeah.
[20:39.350 --> 20:43.390]  And so every time every time I mentioned those, like, it'd be absurd if I did this.
[20:43.430 --> 20:44.850]  And it was already on the way.
[20:44.970 --> 20:46.470]  This has been a whole process.
[20:46.970 --> 20:51.750]  I remember thinking at the time when you were like, I can't believe anyone thought I would
[20:51.750 --> 20:52.550]  actually do that.
[20:52.670 --> 20:57.410]  And I remember thinking to myself, man, this is the least face we've ever been to take the
[20:57.410 --> 20:58.130]  sensible route.
[20:58.210 --> 20:58.870]  That's crazy.
[20:58.970 --> 21:00.910]  And Eric's like bitching about the cost of them.
[21:01.110 --> 21:03.030]  And I was thinking, we have sponsors.
[21:03.030 --> 21:04.350]  We should have a little bit of budget.
[21:04.350 --> 21:05.390]  This is insane.
[21:05.710 --> 21:09.510]  But I'm glad that you were a true face of the entire time, Andrew.
[21:09.910 --> 21:10.930]  Oh, absolutely.
[21:11.050 --> 21:12.350]  This isn't even sponsored.
[21:12.490 --> 21:13.570]  This is I paid for this.
[21:13.710 --> 21:15.650]  This is maybe the nicest gift I've gotten anybody.
[21:16.810 --> 21:18.390]  This is this is for Geoff.
[21:18.470 --> 21:19.970]  I heard a friend in need.
[21:20.390 --> 21:21.510]  He was down a shitter.
[21:22.030 --> 21:25.770]  He was complaining about his daughter having to come into his room at night.
[21:25.810 --> 21:27.050]  That was uncomfortable for her.
[21:27.310 --> 21:29.510]  I needed a solution for the family.
[21:30.050 --> 21:33.530]  So I got you this beautiful pink porta potty.
[21:33.530 --> 21:36.770]  And it should it I it ships today.
[21:36.970 --> 21:38.290]  I don't know how porta potties work.
[21:38.490 --> 21:39.270]  That's the whole thing.
[21:39.570 --> 21:44.390]  This has been a very difficult process because there's not a lot of resources online for
[21:44.390 --> 21:46.390]  how porta potties work in this scenario.
[21:46.610 --> 21:47.430]  Is it rental?
[21:47.870 --> 21:49.230]  No, it's I bought it.
[21:49.290 --> 21:49.850]  It's yours.
[21:50.010 --> 21:50.490]  You own it.
[21:50.590 --> 21:52.010]  You do whatever you want with it.
[21:52.950 --> 21:55.610]  Please, please don't have done this.
[21:55.710 --> 21:56.610]  No, I did this.
[21:56.610 --> 21:57.130]  I'm sorry.
[21:57.310 --> 21:57.870]  I can't.
[21:57.970 --> 21:59.170]  I can't reverse it.
[21:59.270 --> 22:02.870]  That call might be related to the porta potty for delivering it.
[22:03.530 --> 22:05.110]  I was just trying to be a good friend.
[22:05.230 --> 22:06.930]  And you also you love collectibles.
[22:07.170 --> 22:08.510]  You can start collecting these.
[22:08.970 --> 22:10.690]  Please don't let this be true.
[22:10.890 --> 22:12.090]  No, this is absolutely.
[22:12.610 --> 22:13.130]  I'm sorry.
[22:13.510 --> 22:15.230]  This is 100% true.
[22:15.490 --> 22:16.770]  I gotta go look out my window.
[22:17.090 --> 22:17.530]  I know.
[22:17.670 --> 22:21.990]  OK, well, here's the thing, Geoff, and I feel especially bad about this.
[22:22.070 --> 22:27.950]  Now, I bought this without doing any research on how porta potties work or any of this process.
[22:28.130 --> 22:32.490]  So there is a phase in which I ordered it and I thought, oh, shit.
[22:32.490 --> 22:34.170]  Sometimes you need to assemble these.
[22:34.330 --> 22:37.810]  That never even crossed my mind that it could be flat on a simple.
[22:38.130 --> 22:38.570]  Exactly.
[22:38.890 --> 22:40.630]  So that was like a whole scramble.
[22:40.850 --> 22:41.790]  I'm emailing people.
[22:41.970 --> 22:42.950]  I'm trying to do research.
[22:43.270 --> 22:44.190]  I ordered this.
[22:44.310 --> 22:45.850]  I thought you'd get it weeks ago.
[22:46.110 --> 22:47.850]  It was in my mind.
[22:48.130 --> 22:48.910]  I ordered.
[22:49.030 --> 22:50.990]  I thought, well, he's not going anywhere or doing anything.
[22:51.050 --> 22:51.510]  It'll be fine.
[22:51.750 --> 22:58.310]  You went on vacation the next week and I was became this huge scramble of OK.
[22:58.430 --> 23:00.750]  Geoff's not going to be at his house for most of that week.
[23:00.750 --> 23:03.830]  Does somebody need to sign for this if they show up?
[23:04.030 --> 23:08.430]  If it comes unassembled, can I hire like a handyman to come over and build this?
[23:08.610 --> 23:09.990]  So it's there when he returns?
[23:10.310 --> 23:11.190]  It was a whole process.
[23:11.490 --> 23:15.230]  Ended up not even being shipped out until today, I believe, is the ship date.
[23:15.530 --> 23:17.650]  There's no there's no toilet in my front yard.
[23:17.850 --> 23:19.150]  Yeah, well, OK, well, I know.
[23:19.390 --> 23:20.230]  I know that for a fact.
[23:20.290 --> 23:23.330]  You didn't even need to look because once I solved the.
[23:23.650 --> 23:24.290]  No, I had to.
[23:24.390 --> 23:25.070]  I had to look.
[23:25.190 --> 23:25.810]  I didn't have a choice.
[23:27.190 --> 23:28.730]  Well, here's the problem, Geoff.
[23:29.110 --> 23:30.450]  It does come assembled.
[23:30.450 --> 23:33.910]  The thing I then learned and I do, I feel bad about this.
[23:33.990 --> 23:34.310]  I'm sorry.
[23:34.410 --> 23:37.270]  I didn't realize this until weeks after I ordered it.
[23:37.310 --> 23:38.170]  You son of a bitch.
[23:38.290 --> 23:40.910]  They do not unload it off the truck for you.
[23:41.250 --> 23:45.210]  You are going to need to unload the part of body from the truck.
[23:45.410 --> 23:49.270]  It looks very mean it like they will drive it to your house.
[23:49.510 --> 23:50.910]  Well, so he needs a forklift.
[23:51.070 --> 23:51.970]  No, no, no, no, no.
[23:51.990 --> 23:52.750]  I looked into this.
[23:52.790 --> 23:53.830]  You only need a dolly.
[23:53.990 --> 23:57.950]  It's surprisingly easy to move them, but getting it off the truck.
[23:58.030 --> 23:59.910]  I don't know what type of truck it's going to appear in.
[23:59.910 --> 24:01.850]  You got to tilt it and let it drop.
[24:01.950 --> 24:03.350]  I could send you some videos online.
[24:03.470 --> 24:07.250]  It does look very easy, but you're going to have to unload it because they will not.
[24:07.390 --> 24:13.470]  That it's there's no way that driver has ever delivered a port of play to somebody doesn't want it.
[24:15.230 --> 24:18.990]  So he's going to be he's going to be there causing asking Geoff to do all the work.
[24:19.110 --> 24:20.650]  Geoff's like, I don't want the damn thing.
[24:21.010 --> 24:22.390]  I not only do I not want it.
[24:22.410 --> 24:25.270]  I'm not in the shape to do to deal with anything heavy right now.
[24:25.330 --> 24:27.450]  And B, I'm just not going to answer my door.
[24:28.270 --> 24:31.370]  But that poor guy been driving around with a pink port.
[24:31.470 --> 24:32.610]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:32.770 --> 24:34.150]  And you should have thought about that.
[24:34.270 --> 24:37.670]  No, I listen, I believe you're a content guy.
[24:37.850 --> 24:39.610]  You wouldn't reject the content.
[24:39.970 --> 24:40.590]  You got to have the port.
[24:41.210 --> 24:43.050]  It's the nicest gift I've ever given.
[24:43.130 --> 24:45.230]  Geoff, you're going to have to turn down the real poop king.
[24:49.030 --> 24:52.130]  Here's here's here's what Andrew fails to realize.
[24:54.110 --> 24:55.990]  I have a lot of time on my hands.
[24:58.150 --> 25:04.410]  A lot of a lot of time to work on a revenge scenario, and I don't think it needs to go
[25:04.410 --> 25:04.910]  that route.
[25:05.150 --> 25:06.470]  I don't want to have to.
[25:07.270 --> 25:10.470]  It's like as I've gotten older, Gavin, I've calmed down.
[25:10.550 --> 25:14.570]  I think you can acknowledge and agree that as I've matured, I've slowed down a little
[25:14.570 --> 25:14.930]  bit.
[25:15.290 --> 25:18.330]  A, in my annoyance, but B, in my malevolence as well.
[25:18.630 --> 25:19.010]  I agree.
[25:19.130 --> 25:19.650]  I don't agree with that.
[25:19.650 --> 25:26.310]  Yeah, I'm trying to like settle into a more relaxed, mature, easier age.
[25:26.310 --> 25:29.850]  But I still have access to those younger parts of me.
[25:30.010 --> 25:34.690]  And I don't relish the idea of having to to to access them.
[25:35.010 --> 25:36.290]  But I will.
[25:36.510 --> 25:39.570]  And I'll use that to make your your life terrible.
[25:40.690 --> 25:41.890]  I know it's terrible.
[25:42.290 --> 25:44.910]  I don't see why you're viewing this as a bad thing.
[25:45.570 --> 25:48.830]  I'm the only one who stepped up and tried to solve a problem for you.
[25:48.950 --> 25:50.670]  You were like, oh, no, I don't have a toilet.
[25:50.710 --> 25:51.690]  My toilet doesn't work.
[25:51.750 --> 25:52.890]  It's not going to be fixed for months.
[25:53.090 --> 25:55.010]  A problem that was solved three three weeks ago.
[25:55.010 --> 25:55.970]  You knew was solved.
[25:55.970 --> 25:56.610]  No, no, no, no.
[25:56.710 --> 26:00.190]  Last time we recorded, you said they're not going to solve this for months.
[26:00.450 --> 26:01.750]  That's something you said.
[26:02.310 --> 26:03.150]  And who stepped up?
[26:03.450 --> 26:04.590]  Who stepped up for you?
[26:04.930 --> 26:05.390]  This guy.
[26:05.550 --> 26:06.630]  I got you a toilet.
[26:07.210 --> 26:07.850]  Thank you, Andrew.
[26:08.270 --> 26:12.670]  I will say I'm not sure how I'm not sure if Andrew knows how capable Geoff is.
[26:13.270 --> 26:17.550]  Oh, doing these back at you because Geoff went through a phase where
[26:17.550 --> 26:21.290]  he would buy me the most obnoxious gifts possible.
[26:21.290 --> 26:25.970]  At one point, I think I was asleep in the in the house that we,
[26:26.110 --> 26:28.230]  the same house where the branch hit me in the head.
[26:28.630 --> 26:29.910]  Probably like 1 a.m. or something.
[26:30.930 --> 26:33.190]  Crashing noise comes wailing through the door.
[26:33.270 --> 26:34.630]  My bedroom door swings open.
[26:35.090 --> 26:39.170]  It's Geoff on one of those little micro bikes, a little tiny little motorbikes.
[26:39.230 --> 26:39.690]  What are they called?
[26:40.130 --> 26:41.350]  And he does a little motorcycle.
[26:41.570 --> 26:46.050]  Yeah. And he just sort of straddled it, wheeled it in to my bedroom.
[26:46.210 --> 26:47.690]  I was bleary eyed, confused.
[26:48.170 --> 26:49.450]  And he just said, I got you a gift.
[26:49.530 --> 26:50.330]  And then he left it.
[26:50.330 --> 26:51.830]  That was in my room for weeks.
[26:51.990 --> 26:52.810]  And it didn't work.
[26:53.530 --> 26:54.310]  No, it didn't work.
[26:55.130 --> 26:58.310]  It was heavy and hard to move.
[26:58.710 --> 27:02.410]  I think we tried to start it with the pull cord and we broke it off.
[27:02.630 --> 27:04.830]  In a video, dude. We used that in a video.
[27:05.190 --> 27:05.550]  Yeah.
[27:05.790 --> 27:08.670]  Do you remember way, way, way, way, way, way, way back in the day
[27:08.670 --> 27:10.190]  when we would do videos at Rooster Teeth
[27:10.190 --> 27:12.190]  and we would do gameplay like things to do videos?
[27:12.310 --> 27:14.570]  And then at the end, we would film a live action equivalent.
[27:14.950 --> 27:17.190]  Like we'd try to recreate the point live action.
[27:17.510 --> 27:19.430]  That was back then. That's when we did that.
[27:19.690 --> 27:19.830]  Yep.
[27:19.830 --> 27:22.810]  Anyway, I don't see a pink port-a-potty yet, Andrew.
[27:22.990 --> 27:28.550]  But if I do, well, we'll just see how that goes, I guess.
[27:29.150 --> 27:30.730]  Oh, it's going to I mean, it'll get there.
[27:30.890 --> 27:34.370]  I'm trying to find right now the the order confirmation for it.
[27:34.530 --> 27:35.170]  Andrew, are you worried?
[27:35.450 --> 27:36.070]  Are you slightly worried?
[27:36.430 --> 27:37.310]  No, I'm not worried.
[27:37.410 --> 27:38.750]  What about retaliation?
[27:39.110 --> 27:39.250]  Yeah.
[27:39.430 --> 27:41.410]  No, I think that'd be a real unnecessary move.
[27:41.430 --> 27:42.870]  I did a clearly nice thing for Geoff.
[27:42.890 --> 27:43.650]  I don't know why he'd retaliate.
[27:43.710 --> 27:46.090]  There's a lot of there's a lot of nice stuff I can do for you.
[27:47.830 --> 27:49.390]  It's good. I appreciate nice things.

[28:42.180 --> 28:44.660]  That must mean it's close to lunch.
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.420]  Hopefully, I have some HelloFresh in my HelloFridge for my HelloTummy.
[28:50.420 --> 28:51.760]  What's HelloFresh, you may ask?
[28:52.060 --> 28:57.160]  Well, why don't I tell you and also say to you a good hearty hello.

[29:05.760 --> 29:09.640]  I don't know if it's a prerequisite that you own a door or not, but it very well may be.
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.180]  HelloFresh lets you skip those trips to the grocery store.
[29:12.260 --> 29:14.020]  And we all hate the grocery store.
[29:14.560 --> 29:15.820]  That's where people are.
[29:16.100 --> 29:16.920]  They're the worst.
[29:16.920 --> 29:20.260]  And it makes home cooking easy, fun, and affordable.
[29:20.600 --> 29:22.040]  And we all like affordable, right?
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.240]  Because that allows Geoff to buy more basketball cards.
[29:25.500 --> 29:28.340]  And that's why it's America's number one meal kit.
[29:28.520 --> 29:32.420]  The cool thing about HelloFresh is that it cuts out all the stress of meal planning
[29:32.420 --> 29:36.780]  and going to the grocery store like I just mentioned where the other people are.
[29:36.980 --> 29:38.320]  And people are gross.
[29:38.460 --> 29:39.560]  Nobody wants people.
[29:40.080 --> 29:41.640]  We all hate people.
[29:42.140 --> 29:45.760]  So instead, send the groceries to you and you can enjoy cooking

[29:48.640 --> 29:52.460]  That's because they offer 10 to 20 minute meals that are low prep.
[29:52.560 --> 29:54.080]  And when I mean low prep, I mean low prep.
[29:54.140 --> 29:57.840]  It's more than like peeling the film off of your microwave dinner.
[29:58.000 --> 30:01.520]  But you're not like it's not 2000 ingredients and like you're not like
[30:02.220 --> 30:06.840]  stewing stuff for like six hours in a slow pot outside in the cold or anything.
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.660]  This is low prep.
[30:08.340 --> 30:09.840]  Quick breakfasts, quick lunches.
[30:09.880 --> 30:11.080]  It's perfect for your busy schedule.
[30:11.120 --> 30:12.780]  I assume it's perfect for your busy schedule.
[30:12.800 --> 30:14.040]  It's perfect for my busy schedule.
[30:14.040 --> 30:17.240]  From what I understand from most people I talk to, it's perfect for theirs.
[30:17.720 --> 30:20.720]  Plus, with more than 25 recipes to choose from each week,
[30:20.920 --> 30:24.000]  there's something for everyone to enjoy, which is nice.

[30:26.140 --> 30:26.740]  I like everyone.
[30:26.920 --> 30:27.580]  Everyone likes me.
[30:27.720 --> 30:30.460]  So I want everyone to have something to enjoy.

[30:59.300 --> 31:00.380]  We survived 2020.
[31:00.620 --> 31:01.440]  It's 2021.
[31:01.900 --> 31:05.080]  It's a new year, new rear, new you.
[31:05.280 --> 31:10.700]  So don't just make commitments to lose weight or wash your hands every time you poop
[31:10.700 --> 31:13.960]  or eat less of that thing that you really, really like.
[31:14.040 --> 31:17.420]  And so you've decided to deprive yourself of that thing.
[31:17.460 --> 31:20.600]  Or you're gonna read a thousand books or whatever.
[31:21.040 --> 31:24.000]  Instead, go the extra mile and just wash your butthole.
[31:24.340 --> 31:24.680]  That's right.
[31:24.740 --> 31:26.240]  The future of toileting has arrived.
[31:26.440 --> 31:29.960]  And it did it thousands of years in the past because it's been around forever.
[31:30.280 --> 31:33.900]  We're just slow to adopt the good stuff here in America sometimes.
[31:34.280 --> 31:36.500]  It took us forever to get bidets and baguettes.
[31:36.640 --> 31:38.740]  I don't know why, but thank Christ they're here.
[31:38.740 --> 31:42.380]  Also, peri-peri chicken, looking at you, England, it's very good.
[31:42.700 --> 31:46.280]  And after you have your peri-peri chicken, you're gonna want a bidet.
[31:46.680 --> 31:47.260]  That's right.
[31:47.560 --> 31:53.220]  The brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 modern bidet attachment is here to level the anal playing
[31:53.220 --> 31:53.540]  field.

[31:55.160 --> 31:56.160]  It's easy to install.
[31:56.360 --> 31:57.060]  It's affordable.
[31:57.480 --> 32:01.800]  And you're gonna... you're gonna... if you get the extra spicy peri-peri chicken, you
[32:01.800 --> 32:02.560]  know what I'm talking about.
[32:02.680 --> 32:03.700]  You're gonna want it.
[32:03.800 --> 32:04.260]  Trust me.
[32:04.480 --> 32:05.080]  I've been there.

[32:07.520 --> 32:08.260]  Take a look at it.
[32:08.260 --> 32:09.300]  Do you have an older model?
[32:09.500 --> 32:11.040]  I'm sure it's still serving you very well.
[32:11.280 --> 32:14.300]  But you might want to consider upgrading to the new 3.0.

[32:39.340 --> 32:41.120]  Geoff, how did you injure yourself?
[32:45.080 --> 32:45.520]  Well...
[32:47.820 --> 32:49.680]  I thought I disconnected from the call.
[32:49.700 --> 32:50.820]  Yeah, I was checking my internet.
[32:51.080 --> 32:52.180]  I was already checking my internet.
[32:52.620 --> 32:54.180]  I was just thinking about it.
[32:56.780 --> 32:58.060]  It was Saturday.
[32:59.880 --> 33:05.500]  And, you know, we had just gone through the big freeze and we had all been cooped up in
[33:05.500 --> 33:10.940]  our houses in the cold for a week or so without electricity.
[33:11.180 --> 33:14.500]  Or if we did have electricity, we weren't supposed to use it, you know,
[33:14.560 --> 33:20.380]  and with boiling water and the whole deal because Texas just fell apart as a state.
[33:20.740 --> 33:24.760]  And I was going a little stir crazy, you know.
[33:25.100 --> 33:29.620]  And so my neighborhood was actually really...
[33:29.620 --> 33:30.660]  Like I tried to...
[33:30.660 --> 33:33.560]  I was supposed to get Millie and from her mom's.
[33:33.920 --> 33:35.980]  And I got in the car and it was so bad.
[33:36.280 --> 33:41.140]  I got my car stuck in for almost an hour and it took like six people to try to push it out.
[33:41.620 --> 33:42.960]  And so I was like, I couldn't...
[33:42.960 --> 33:43.400]  Like you couldn't...
[33:43.400 --> 33:47.700]  It was really hard to even drive or walk in our neighborhood because it was just so much
[33:47.700 --> 33:48.540]  ice everywhere in the streets.
[33:48.600 --> 33:51.490]  And, you know, we don't have salt and all that stuff to...
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.440]  We don't have the infrastructure to clear the roads.
[33:54.760 --> 33:56.800]  So I was just like sitting in the house for a week.
[33:56.900 --> 33:59.040]  And so on Saturday, it had melted enough.
[33:59.060 --> 34:03.500]  It started to melt on Friday that I thought maybe I'll just go for a bike ride.
[34:03.560 --> 34:06.120]  I'd just be super, super, super careful.
[34:08.520 --> 34:10.600]  So I got on my bike and I started going...
[34:10.600 --> 34:11.040]  Insane decision.
[34:11.560 --> 34:12.880]  Started going on my bike.
[34:13.020 --> 34:15.140]  Well, they got dumber.
[34:16.120 --> 34:21.400]  And so the roads were muddy, but pretty safe.
[34:21.620 --> 34:22.900]  Like wet, but not icy.
[34:23.240 --> 34:23.380]  Right?
[34:23.540 --> 34:29.840]  And so I probably was about five miles into my ride, this normal ride I have.
[34:30.280 --> 34:33.220]  And I get to one of my two favorite spots in Austin.
[34:34.060 --> 34:37.360]  And it's just a place where I can get my bicycle.
[34:37.460 --> 34:41.600]  I can go very, very, very fast down a hill and do some slightly dangerous stuff.
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.380]  And so this is like the second best little danger spot that I like to hit.
[34:47.260 --> 34:48.800]  And it looked clear.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.560]  Basically, what it is, it's a road that goes downhill really fast.
[34:51.680 --> 34:53.400]  And then it goes under an overpass, right?
[34:53.440 --> 34:54.000]  Under a bridge.
[34:54.360 --> 35:00.420]  And on the left, there's an embankment that goes, I don't know, maybe 20, 25 feet up in the air.
[35:00.760 --> 35:02.820]  You know, at maybe like a 60 degree pitch.
[35:02.820 --> 35:05.940]  And it's like, you know what I'm talking about, right?
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.040]  Like under a bridge.
[35:07.180 --> 35:10.080]  It's just like that, that concrete, smooth concrete embankment that goes all the way up.
[35:10.480 --> 35:16.300]  Well, you can do a thing where you can kind of, if you get going really fast down this hill,
[35:16.820 --> 35:20.780]  you can kind of bunny hop onto that little, that 60 degree incline,
[35:20.940 --> 35:23.220]  and then ride up it to get extra speed.
[35:23.420 --> 35:25.980]  And then take a sharp turn and go straight down.
[35:26.220 --> 35:29.940]  And you can get going like, you know, 35, 40 miles an hour on a bicycle doing this.
[35:30.620 --> 35:32.340]  And it's a little dicey because there's traffic.
[35:32.340 --> 35:34.680]  You know, and there's not a lot to stop you.
[35:34.820 --> 35:36.240]  And you're going towards traffic.
[35:36.240 --> 35:37.720]  It's oncoming traffic as well.
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.420]  So that all part kind of sucks.
[35:40.860 --> 35:46.360]  Anyway, so I approached that and I had a split second decision and I made the wrong decision.
[35:46.560 --> 35:50.200]  The decision I made was to gun it because it looked clear.
[35:50.800 --> 35:53.600]  And so I went down and I got, I was only going about 22.
[35:54.200 --> 35:58.200]  I looked at the speedometer, I was going about 22 when I hit the ice that I couldn't see.
[35:58.300 --> 35:59.040]  Oh my god.
[35:59.040 --> 36:04.120]  So I hit the bunny hop and I go up and I climb pretty high up,
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.340]  maybe 12 feet in the air or whatever.
[36:07.060 --> 36:09.820]  And up top, because it's dark, that's where the ice is.
[36:10.120 --> 36:11.080]  I didn't see it.
[36:12.020 --> 36:14.860]  So I hit that going, you know...
[36:14.860 --> 36:18.100]  So you hit ice going sharply uphill?
[36:18.920 --> 36:20.460]  At that point, I'd kind of leveled out.
[36:20.540 --> 36:21.760]  So I was kind of just going straight.
[36:22.040 --> 36:27.020]  But, you know, only the left side of my bike is touching the ground, right?
[36:27.040 --> 36:28.260]  Like you're riding on an angle.
[36:28.260 --> 36:32.000]  So you're like, yeah, not there's no traction, you know, far off a wall ride.
[36:32.100 --> 36:33.180]  It's it's it's a wall ride.
[36:33.260 --> 36:35.960]  Yeah, it's kind of dicey on a sunny, dry day.
[36:36.720 --> 36:38.640]  But I've never crashed at that point.
[36:38.860 --> 36:40.200]  I've never crashed at that part before.
[36:40.700 --> 36:41.460]  Boy, have I now.
[36:41.740 --> 36:48.480]  So anyway, about 22, I think, is when I the bike got out from under me when I hit the patch of ice.
[36:48.760 --> 36:54.160]  And then I, you know, I was all bundled up with gloves and jackets and thermal
[36:54.680 --> 36:56.680]  long johns and stuff because it's fucking cold still.
[36:57.800 --> 37:03.340]  So what happened was the bike went out from under me and it hooked my leg and it took my leg with it.
[37:03.460 --> 37:06.840]  So we're going downhill really fast now.
[37:07.280 --> 37:10.340]  And we're going right at the traffic that's coming at me.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.340]  And and so I put my arms out and like the ground grabbed them and it kind of pulled
[37:17.340 --> 37:21.460]  them behind me and it kind of wrenched both of my arms, especially my left arm,
[37:21.520 --> 37:24.060]  unfortunately, which is the one that I just did all that physical therapy for
[37:24.060 --> 37:25.700]  and that I have arthritis in.
[37:25.700 --> 37:28.620]  That one, it damn near ripped it out of socket.
[37:29.020 --> 37:35.120]  Anyway, so I became a like a little meat bullet and I was headed right for the like
[37:35.120 --> 37:42.360]  wrapped up in my bicycle and and and headed straight at the at the what I thought I was
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.420]  headed straight at the cars, you know, and I thought, well, that's the end of that.
[37:46.820 --> 37:52.320]  But however, what I missed was the giant concrete pylon that was supporting the
[37:52.320 --> 37:54.540]  the bridge, I guess, in between the cars.
[37:54.540 --> 37:59.680]  I came upon that big pillar and it broke my fall at speed.
[38:00.400 --> 38:05.620]  So I slammed into that going downhill on the ice with the bike wrapped up in the bike.
[38:05.980 --> 38:13.780]  And luckily, there was enough mud and snow and rocks and water and dirt all collected
[38:13.780 --> 38:16.540]  at the bottom that I just slammed right into that.
[38:16.620 --> 38:21.420]  And it was like real gentle, except I hit it so hard and knocked my hat off and both
[38:21.420 --> 38:30.280]  my headphones, my AirPods took off and my it was it was a whole rigmarole and a lot
[38:30.280 --> 38:30.920]  of sunglasses.
[38:31.200 --> 38:32.500]  You crashed your headphones.
[38:32.860 --> 38:34.960]  I crashed my headphones out of my ears.
[38:35.560 --> 38:40.360]  And then I just lay in there and I'm just covered in like black ice and mud and stuff.
[38:40.380 --> 38:46.420]  And I'm wedged in under my bike between this wall, this this graded wall and this
[38:46.420 --> 38:48.900]  pylon and cars are just zooming by me.
[38:48.900 --> 38:51.860]  And I, you know, you like you stay you lay there for a second, you take a breath, you
[38:51.860 --> 38:53.920]  feel like nothing's nothing's broken.
[38:54.140 --> 38:56.260]  I don't feel I don't feel like anything protruding or anything.
[38:56.580 --> 39:00.500]  So I but I can feel this is kind of the funniest part, I guess.
[39:00.720 --> 39:03.920]  I can feel my hands were on fire, like my hands were burning.
[39:04.280 --> 39:07.340]  And I was like, oh, what the fuck is by the way, my phone is going crazy with somebody
[39:07.340 --> 39:08.140]  trying to call me and leave.
[39:08.680 --> 39:11.240]  It better not be a goddamn portal potty.
[39:11.360 --> 39:12.740]  You should answer that.
[39:12.860 --> 39:13.440]  You should answer.
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.460]  No, I'm absolutely not.
[39:14.580 --> 39:15.500]  If they call again, I will.
[39:15.500 --> 39:19.580]  So so anyway, I look at my hands, I pick up my hands and my hands just have the gloves
[39:19.580 --> 39:20.340]  on them and they're fine.
[39:20.480 --> 39:23.640]  But something looks weird about my hands and I can't it takes me a second to figure it
[39:23.640 --> 39:23.740]  out.
[39:23.780 --> 39:30.400]  And then I realized my gloves, my like my little knit like gloves are somehow now backwards
[39:30.400 --> 39:31.080]  on my hands.
[39:32.220 --> 39:37.620]  My thumb is through the pinky finger and my pinky fingers through the thumb on both hands.
[39:37.740 --> 39:43.480]  Like my gloves did a 180 on my hands and then perfectly put themselves back, put themselves
[39:43.480 --> 39:45.460]  back in the right finger slot.
[39:45.480 --> 39:46.720]  What are you talking about?
[39:47.020 --> 39:48.180]  I swear to God.
[39:48.680 --> 39:50.000]  Like, well, they weren't totally down.
[39:50.100 --> 39:53.360]  They were still like they were kind of puffed up a little bit, but I guess like because I
[39:53.360 --> 39:54.640]  put my hands out behind me.
[39:55.340 --> 39:57.180]  Well, anyway, so I went like, that's weird.
[39:57.280 --> 39:59.460]  So I and my hands just like hurt so bad.
[39:59.460 --> 39:59.700]  Right.
[39:59.720 --> 40:03.740]  And so I turn the gloves around and as I turn the gloves around to put them on right, the
[40:03.740 --> 40:08.880]  holes in the glove lined up in the holes where my skin used to be on on both hands.
[40:08.880 --> 40:11.680]  And I realized that I had rubbed off.
[40:11.680 --> 40:16.180]  You know how like if you break a jawbreaker in half and you can see the different layers
[40:16.180 --> 40:17.220]  of different color.
[40:17.740 --> 40:21.060]  That's what my that's what my palm looks like on my left hand.
[40:21.360 --> 40:25.440]  And then the top of my right hand, because I guess that one was backwards and it just
[40:25.440 --> 40:28.680]  rubbed all the skin off my knuckles and my hand and stuff.
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.220]  And then but the really bad one is my left hand.
[40:32.920 --> 40:35.600]  And anyway, so I got up and it took me a while.
[40:36.020 --> 40:36.920]  I'll be honest with you.
[40:36.920 --> 40:42.260]  I was dizzy because I hit that pylon so hard that it knocked the shit out of me, you know.
[40:42.680 --> 40:46.120]  And so it took me a couple seconds to figure out where I was and what had happened.
[40:46.400 --> 40:51.060]  And then I collected my... it took me a while to find my AirPods, my glasses.
[40:51.680 --> 40:54.300]  And then I rode away and realized I'd left my hat.
[40:54.420 --> 40:56.820]  So I had to turn around and go back and then put my hat on.
[40:56.900 --> 41:00.400]  And I looked down and I had destroyed an entire pair of pants.
[41:00.520 --> 41:02.000]  Like the left side of my pants was gone.
[41:02.160 --> 41:04.060]  It was just shredded like in a cartoon.
[41:04.060 --> 41:08.400]  But luckily my long johns were still on and they were fine.
[41:08.480 --> 41:10.160]  My sock, my left sock was gone.
[41:10.280 --> 41:12.680]  It was just stripped up into shreds and my gloves were ruined.
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.300]  So I was five miles into a 30 mile ride and it cost me a pair of pants,
[41:18.020 --> 41:23.120]  half the skin on my hands, quite possibly a concussion, a pair of socks,
[41:23.400 --> 41:24.500]  and definitely a pair of gloves.
[41:25.060 --> 41:30.520]  And so I was so frustrated that I determined that I was going to have
[41:30.520 --> 41:32.000]  the best ride of my life to make up for it.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.800]  I managed about another 15 miles before I had to turn around and go home and bandage myself up.
[41:37.880 --> 41:43.080]  I'm imagining a nice static frame of you going up that thing like,
[41:43.220 --> 41:47.700]  yeah, badass! You go up and then without any change,
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.560]  you just come sliding down in a mess of crumpled heap in the same image.
[41:51.820 --> 41:56.360]  Your hands are backwards, like a shitty version of Tenet,
[41:56.620 --> 41:58.560]  but it's just your hands have gone backwards.
[42:00.680 --> 42:02.100]  Dude, it hurts so bad.
[42:02.640 --> 42:03.280]  Still in pain?
[42:04.500 --> 42:06.440]  Yeah, well, it was Saturday. Today's Tuesday.
[42:06.700 --> 42:09.760]  So yesterday was really bad. Today's gotten better.
[42:10.240 --> 42:17.060]  But anyway, my bike's pretty fucked up, too.
[42:17.460 --> 42:18.760]  I don't know that I can ride it anymore.
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.700]  Well, I was able to ride it for the rest of the day, but it needs a lot of work.
[42:22.340 --> 42:27.020]  It's at a lot of odd angles now and I lost a lot of it.
[42:27.020 --> 42:28.840]  A lot of stuff popped off.
[42:29.100 --> 42:30.800]  What an insane decision to do that.
[42:31.180 --> 42:35.080]  It's hard to describe how... I mean, there are obviously colder places.
[42:35.420 --> 42:38.700]  A lot of people making fun of Texas for not being able to handle a little bit of snow.
[42:38.880 --> 42:42.800]  And it got down to like minus 16 in Austin, I think, in Celsius,
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.120]  which is pretty cold in general. Insane for Texas.
[42:47.260 --> 42:48.560]  Never seen anything like it.
[42:48.760 --> 42:50.560]  Been here 28 years, I've never seen anything like it.
[42:50.700 --> 42:53.740]  Well, I mean, even today, it's like 26 degrees Celsius today.
[42:54.120 --> 42:55.380]  Yeah, T-shirt weather.
[42:55.380 --> 42:57.140]  It's T-shirt and shorts time.
[42:57.300 --> 42:59.240]  So the fact that it dropped so low was mental.
[42:59.560 --> 43:02.040]  But to then go on a bike ride during it.
[43:02.560 --> 43:04.640]  God, I can't believe that.
[43:04.700 --> 43:05.940]  It seems pretty self-inflicted.
[43:06.180 --> 43:07.820]  Probably won't do it again anytime soon.
[43:08.160 --> 43:08.640]  Probably?
[43:09.740 --> 43:10.640]  Probably won't.
[43:11.180 --> 43:13.520]  If you hadn't hit the pillar, would you have slid into traffic?
[43:13.940 --> 43:15.160]  Uh-huh. Yeah.
[43:15.540 --> 43:16.960]  Yeah, I was going pretty fast.
[43:18.220 --> 43:23.820]  Just with like the speed and shock of how hard I hit the pillar
[43:23.820 --> 43:26.980]  tells me that I was going pretty fast at that point, you know.
[43:27.240 --> 43:29.560]  I think we should point out that pillar.
[43:29.640 --> 43:31.740]  Maybe we could spray paint a little bit of graffiti.
[43:32.500 --> 43:33.940]  Geoff was here 2021.
[43:35.600 --> 43:36.800]  Definitely, definitely do that.
[43:36.940 --> 43:38.040]  I ride by it all the time.
[43:38.300 --> 43:41.400]  I'm sure I'm not in shape to ride my bike again right now,
[43:41.400 --> 43:42.700]  and I'm going to have to get it worked on.
[43:42.840 --> 43:45.080]  But I'm sure by this weekend, I'll be riding again.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.720]  And I'll swing by there.
[43:47.220 --> 43:51.160]  Yeah, because I'd love people to be able to know that was the pillar that saved you.
[43:51.180 --> 43:53.180]  And also knocked your headphones out.
[43:53.180 --> 43:53.860]  Yes.
[43:53.860 --> 43:54.720]  Fucking hurt so bad.
[43:54.860 --> 43:55.840]  Knocked my gloves backwards.
[43:56.080 --> 43:58.700]  The modern day, knocked my socks off.
[43:58.780 --> 44:00.380]  Yeah, it's like headphones out.
[44:00.700 --> 44:03.440]  Literally knocked my gloves backwards on my hand.
[44:04.540 --> 44:06.300]  Imagining just an explosion.
[44:10.940 --> 44:12.900]  So Andrew, you're not really Andrew.
[44:13.560 --> 44:13.660]  What?
[44:15.660 --> 44:16.440]  Right, right.
[44:16.580 --> 44:17.920]  Well, that caught me off guard.
[44:18.400 --> 44:18.900]  I was excited.
[44:19.020 --> 44:20.080]  Imagine how we felt.
[44:20.300 --> 44:21.100]  That was a pivot.
[44:21.100 --> 44:24.100]  I'm just just to put a bow on it.
[44:24.180 --> 44:26.860]  I don't feel bad about sending you a port-a-potty while injured now.
[44:27.300 --> 44:29.020]  I think that sounds like it was your fault entirely.
[44:29.640 --> 44:30.400]  I don't feel bad about it.
[44:30.400 --> 44:31.240]  I felt bad before.
[44:31.680 --> 44:34.400]  Yeah, that story made me feel better about the overall timing of the thing.
[44:34.620 --> 44:36.940]  I didn't pick for the timing, but I felt really bad.
[44:36.980 --> 44:37.700]  I don't feel bad now.
[44:38.060 --> 44:39.180]  That's a crazy move by you.
[44:40.580 --> 44:42.320]  What do I have a voicemail from now?
[44:42.640 --> 44:43.440]  God damn it.
[44:43.740 --> 44:44.380]  I sent a text.
[44:44.520 --> 44:46.080]  Could you listen to the voicemail, please?
[44:46.340 --> 44:47.620]  I'm going to listen to it right now.
[44:47.620 --> 44:47.880]  OK.
[44:49.060 --> 44:49.700]  Don't speak.
[44:49.700 --> 44:51.840]  Well, one of them might be my lunch order, so.
[44:54.680 --> 44:55.500]  Yeah, it's not.
[44:56.240 --> 44:57.080]  It's not.
[44:57.200 --> 44:57.360]  OK.
[44:57.780 --> 44:59.180]  It was just it was just the pharmacy.
[44:59.720 --> 45:00.680]  That's what's exciting.
[45:01.160 --> 45:04.400]  I like the idea that every unknown call you're going to get from now
[45:04.400 --> 45:07.600]  until maybe the end of the week is going to be a level of fear.
[45:07.980 --> 45:10.080]  Yeah, it's a huge level of fear.
[45:10.120 --> 45:12.520]  And also the fact that, like, I'm waiting.
[45:12.520 --> 45:20.000]  I've gotten into the like the Goodwill online sports card bidding.
[45:20.600 --> 45:20.720]  Sure.
[45:20.820 --> 45:24.660]  Because Goodwill, you know, Goodwill has cards and you can you can shop Goodwill like you can eBay.
[45:25.100 --> 45:30.120]  And so I'm waiting on like nine different lots from Goodwill to show up on my front door as well.
[45:30.200 --> 45:34.960]  So now it's like I've already been I've already been a 10 year old waiting by the door for mail
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.060]  for the last fucking week because the mail's been shit because of all the snow.
[45:39.060 --> 45:44.160]  And I'm waiting on like a gold mine of thousands of cards, plus all my eBay purchases.
[45:44.620 --> 45:48.600]  So now I'm going to now I'm going to now I'm going to be waiting with dread and anticipation.
[45:48.800 --> 45:51.400]  Dude, people have gone deep into the Zimmer zone.
[45:51.620 --> 45:52.240]  They have.
[45:52.420 --> 45:53.820]  Based on the fuckface Instagram.
[45:54.300 --> 45:56.380]  Dude, Zimzone is ridiculous.
[45:56.620 --> 46:01.380]  I'm getting I bought all the Zimmers I needed before, luckily,
[46:01.880 --> 46:03.640]  because I wouldn't be able to keep up with the bids now.
[46:03.680 --> 46:05.600]  They're going out of fucking control right now.
[46:05.840 --> 46:06.280]  There's Zimmers.
[46:06.500 --> 46:08.720]  There's Zimmer manager cards on for like 20, 30 bucks.
[46:08.720 --> 46:14.860]  I saw, Andrew, you you text us a screenshot of people being very confused as to why the value
[46:14.860 --> 46:16.100]  is jumped up.
[46:16.340 --> 46:20.240]  Yeah, there is a thread on the baseball subreddit of just somebody saying,
[46:20.400 --> 46:21.860]  what is causing this? What is happening?
[46:21.980 --> 46:24.180]  Dude, it made my heart so happy to see that.
[46:24.320 --> 46:27.080]  It's also, you know, I told you we could get on the top 100 or whatever.
[46:27.280 --> 46:27.480]  Yeah.
[46:27.620 --> 46:30.060]  Most we're there already on there.
[46:30.280 --> 46:31.520]  Somebody on Twitter sent me that today.
[46:31.880 --> 46:34.820]  What were we at? Like 80? I think I saw the same tweet.
[46:34.880 --> 46:36.620]  I want to say we're like something like something like that.
[46:36.700 --> 46:38.080]  Yeah, I don't know. It's gone up.
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.080]  It's there as well on the Instagram that someone had bought some Zim stock.
[46:43.180 --> 46:48.300]  It's like some some random company that's said, I am.
[46:49.040 --> 46:49.900]  What's Zim stock?
[46:50.420 --> 46:52.000]  It's taking it to a new level.
[46:52.220 --> 46:54.740]  Don Zimmer cards are the new currency, right?
[46:54.780 --> 47:00.460]  Like if bottle caps can be currency in fucking Fallout, why can't or bullets in
[47:01.020 --> 47:03.640]  Metro? Why can't we have Don Zimmer cards be currency?
[47:04.100 --> 47:04.580]  I agree.
[47:05.120 --> 47:07.200]  Or the book. The book is great.
[47:07.200 --> 47:09.320]  I wish there was a card of the book covers.
[47:09.720 --> 47:10.180]  Those are great.
[47:10.360 --> 47:10.820]  No, me too.
[47:11.100 --> 47:12.360]  Me too, dude.
[47:12.660 --> 47:16.320]  So speaking of Zimmer, let me I'm going to send you guys a video I took.
[47:16.400 --> 47:17.320]  I wanted to show you this earlier.
[47:17.760 --> 47:22.580]  This is fucking I mentioned how out of control I am on this card collecting thing, and I don't
[47:22.580 --> 47:23.440]  think you guys get it.
[47:23.720 --> 47:27.160]  So here is a video of I took earlier today.
[47:27.520 --> 47:35.520]  That's just of all the current orders I have out that I've won on eBay for cards.
[47:35.520 --> 47:41.940]  Not just existing auctions, of which there are very many or orders that I've gotten.
[47:42.020 --> 47:44.020]  And these are just all the outstanding stuff.
[47:44.380 --> 47:47.820]  Orders that I've bought that I'm waiting to receive.
[47:48.040 --> 47:48.980]  So I took a little video of it.
[47:49.060 --> 47:50.120]  I sent it to the discord.
[47:50.360 --> 47:51.400]  I don't know if it showed up yet.
[47:52.240 --> 47:55.740]  That's fucking compressing a file, which means it'll never hate that.
[47:56.900 --> 48:01.080]  I don't think when anyone on this show has ever said I'm going to send something, it
[48:01.080 --> 48:01.920]  has ever gone well.
[48:02.200 --> 48:04.100]  I know it's a minimum of three minutes.
[48:04.100 --> 48:05.960]  Everything fails that could possibly fail.
[48:06.220 --> 48:07.560]  I looked into Zimstock.
[48:08.200 --> 48:10.060]  Zimstock on the way down, sadly.
[48:10.240 --> 48:11.360]  Yeah, Zimstock is...
[48:11.360 --> 48:12.600]  It's skyrocketed.
[48:12.960 --> 48:14.420]  It says Zim...
[48:14.420 --> 48:15.560]  It's like a shipping company.
[48:16.200 --> 48:18.040]  Integrated Shipping Services Limited.
[48:18.620 --> 48:20.200]  Imagine if they delivered the port-a-potty.
[48:20.540 --> 48:21.620]  What a great thing that would be.
[48:21.640 --> 48:23.160]  What if it was a Zim delivery?
[48:23.400 --> 48:25.380]  Dude, I would accept it if it's a Zim delivery.
[48:25.540 --> 48:26.840]  I mean, you're accepting it no matter what.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.580]  Well, we'll see about that.
[48:29.040 --> 48:30.780]  It's $20 a share of this company.
[48:31.260 --> 48:32.320]  Dude, stock market's dangerous.
[48:32.320 --> 48:33.800]  I'm not even sure that...
[48:35.340 --> 48:38.860]  Listen, don't buy Zimstock because we said,
[48:38.960 --> 48:41.560]  I don't want to go to jail for doing some sort of illegal stock.
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.600]  Wait, are you invested in Zimstock?
[48:43.960 --> 48:45.000]  No, I don't think so.
[48:45.140 --> 48:47.140]  But if I am...
[48:48.220 --> 48:50.180]  What a conspiracy that would be.
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.380]  I just like baseball cards.
[48:52.540 --> 48:53.620]  I don't want...
[48:53.620 --> 48:54.540]  I'm not trying to convince people to get stuck.
[48:54.540 --> 48:55.400]  You're defensive court.
[48:55.980 --> 48:57.120]  I just like baseball cards.
[48:57.740 --> 48:57.960]  All right.
[48:58.040 --> 49:01.420]  For whatever reason, when I put stuff on Discord from my phone, it never goes there.
[49:01.420 --> 49:03.240]  So let me do it this way.
[49:03.700 --> 49:04.380]  What do you mean?
[49:04.480 --> 49:05.080]  Like it doesn't load?
[49:05.800 --> 49:06.200]  Yeah.
[49:06.460 --> 49:07.640]  What is the video of?
[49:08.100 --> 49:10.780]  It's just a video of all of me scrolling through all the existing
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.640]  packages, all the existing cards that I have on the way from eBay right now.
[49:16.120 --> 49:16.520]  Okay.
[49:17.140 --> 49:19.280]  Over, under, Gavin, 25.
[49:19.880 --> 49:20.620]  25 what?
[49:21.060 --> 49:22.500]  Over... for what he just said.
[49:22.580 --> 49:25.760]  Are you not... he just described a scenario and I said a line for you.
[49:25.920 --> 49:27.080]  Oh, it's going to be way over 25.
[49:27.400 --> 49:28.000]  You think way over?
[49:28.280 --> 49:28.480]  Yeah.
[49:28.780 --> 49:30.120]  I'm going to guess 28.
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.520]  We do another number game.
[49:31.800 --> 49:33.020]  It's in Slack now.
[49:33.260 --> 49:36.200]  While we're looking at this, I feel like I need to ask Geoff.
[49:36.560 --> 49:37.220]  Here's another thing.
[49:37.320 --> 49:39.460]  This has been on my mind for days now.
[49:39.600 --> 49:47.120]  The last time we recorded, you very happily declared that your pipes will be fine for
[49:47.120 --> 49:47.900]  the rest of time.
[49:48.240 --> 49:49.760]  How are your pipes through this storm?
[49:49.980 --> 49:50.720]  Everything good?
[49:51.240 --> 49:52.420]  I'll be honest with you.
[49:53.140 --> 49:54.520]  I've had a lit...
[49:54.520 --> 49:55.180]  I've had...
[49:55.180 --> 49:58.440]  I've had, uh, like, pipe survivor guilt.
[50:00.420 --> 50:07.200]  My pipes got fixed about, I don't know what, 10 days before the storm.
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.620]  And I would guess that partially because of that, because I had two problem areas.
[50:14.100 --> 50:20.600]  One, a leak in the wall that they found that absolutely would have frozen and blown my
[50:20.600 --> 50:22.840]  wall out where it was in the house.
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.320]  And then the issue under the house.
[50:25.320 --> 50:30.680]  Both of those would have 100% exploded, uh, during this snowstorm.
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.760]  So, getting them fixed, uh, fixed the two weak areas I had.
[50:36.100 --> 50:37.820]  And, uh, my plumbing was...
[50:37.820 --> 50:43.260]  I mean, aside from having no pressure and having to boil water, my pipes were fine the entire
[50:43.260 --> 50:43.640]  time.
[50:43.780 --> 50:45.480]  I bundled them really well.
[50:45.600 --> 50:46.320]  I kept them warm.
[50:46.640 --> 50:51.160]  One of them froze up a little bit on the second day, so I took out a space heater and a blow
[50:51.160 --> 50:53.800]  dryer and I thawed it out and then re-wrapped it and it was fine.
[50:53.800 --> 50:56.360]  I dripped them until they told us not to drip anymore.
[50:56.560 --> 50:58.380]  And I never had a frozen pipe.
[50:58.520 --> 51:01.640]  I never had any kind of plumbing problems the entire time.
[51:01.880 --> 51:05.060]  And I felt really terrible about that until I was sitting there thinking about all the
[51:05.060 --> 51:10.260]  people that I know that have had pipes burst over the last week and how, how, uh, how that
[51:10.260 --> 51:12.420]  was my life for the six weeks leading up to this moment.
[51:12.440 --> 51:14.480]  So I've decided I'm not gonna feel...
[51:14.480 --> 51:18.420]  I'm not gonna feel guilty about it anymore because I got all of my bad plumbing luck
[51:18.420 --> 51:20.180]  out of the way leading up to this incident.
[51:20.180 --> 51:26.380]  But man, do I, I feel sympathy for all of my brothers and sisters in Austin who are
[51:26.380 --> 51:29.720]  now having to deal with prolonged plumbing problems because I've been there.
[51:30.120 --> 51:31.100]  I've been there and it's not fun.
[51:31.260 --> 51:32.180]  Good time to be a plumber.
[51:32.440 --> 51:33.560]  Yeah, great time to be a plumber.
[51:33.720 --> 51:35.020]  Good time for a career change.
[51:35.180 --> 51:35.420]  Maybe.
[51:35.760 --> 51:36.960]  I'm looking at your video now, Geoff.
[51:37.100 --> 51:38.680]  That looks to be around 25.
[51:39.160 --> 51:39.960]  There's 40.
[51:40.280 --> 51:41.040]  It was like 48.
[51:41.220 --> 51:41.520]  Is it 40?
[51:41.900 --> 51:42.960]  Yeah, it was in the 40s.
[51:43.420 --> 51:44.720]  What about you, Gavin?
[51:44.800 --> 51:45.720]  How's your plumbing?
[51:45.980 --> 51:46.680]  Everything good?
[51:47.120 --> 51:48.280]  Yeah, no, my bugs are fine.
[51:48.720 --> 51:49.560]  No, it's all good.
[51:50.180 --> 51:51.240]  No need to send anything.
[51:51.860 --> 51:52.560]  It's on a mixture.
[51:53.080 --> 51:55.020]  You didn't get a two for one special, did you?
[51:56.500 --> 51:58.020]  No, they do not.
[51:58.340 --> 51:59.900]  There's not a buy one, get one free.
[52:00.160 --> 52:02.160]  I see what you're saying, Andrew, and I love it.
[52:02.220 --> 52:05.320]  You think I should take the porta potty to Gavin's house and leave it there.
[52:05.560 --> 52:06.780]  No, it's a great idea.
[52:07.140 --> 52:11.860]  I'm just saying that if he needed it, I was just asking in case he needed it because I'm
[52:11.860 --> 52:12.380]  a good friend.
[52:12.580 --> 52:13.020]  You're right.
[52:13.100 --> 52:13.860]  You're right, Andrew.
[52:13.940 --> 52:14.380]  You're right.
[52:14.460 --> 52:16.780]  I now have an extra bathroom where I don't need it.
[52:16.780 --> 52:21.140]  And there are a lot of people named Gavin in Austin that might have plumbing problems
[52:21.140 --> 52:22.620]  right now, thanks to the last week.
[52:22.720 --> 52:26.040]  And I should absolutely lend a hand to my fellow neighbor.
[52:26.200 --> 52:27.240]  And I'm going to bring this.
[52:27.540 --> 52:29.880]  I'm going to bring this pink porta potty the second I get it.
[52:29.900 --> 52:30.840]  I'm going to take it to Gavin's house.
[52:30.960 --> 52:32.820]  Won't be needing one of those.
[52:33.200 --> 52:35.520]  Well, it'll be there for you if you need it.
[52:36.840 --> 52:38.440]  I'll just I'll put it in your front yard.
[52:38.480 --> 52:38.840]  Don't worry.
[52:39.960 --> 52:41.080]  Damn, Andrew, you're smart.
[52:41.180 --> 52:41.520]  Thanks, man.
[52:41.740 --> 52:42.500]  Yeah, I'm a good friend.
[52:42.560 --> 52:43.700]  I'm just trying to look out for people.
[52:43.840 --> 52:44.900]  You solved that problem for me.
[52:44.900 --> 52:46.840]  Yeah, it wasn't a problem to begin with.
[52:46.880 --> 52:47.940]  It was a very kind gesture.
[52:48.160 --> 52:50.300]  I kind of don't like the concept of it being a problem.
[52:50.460 --> 52:52.760]  But, you know, Gavin needs it.
[52:53.040 --> 52:53.820]  That's always an option.
[52:54.740 --> 52:56.400]  I think I was quite clear.
[52:57.460 --> 53:00.720]  You know, I've got mushrooms, but I've got I don't need a porta potty.
[53:00.780 --> 53:02.060]  Yeah, you know, you never know.
[53:02.340 --> 53:03.820]  Portabello mushroom, porta potty.
[53:05.160 --> 53:06.220]  Some symmetry there.
[53:08.140 --> 53:08.740]  That's perfect.
[53:10.260 --> 53:10.960]  Is that it?
[53:11.060 --> 53:11.520]  Is that really?
[53:11.520 --> 53:15.360]  Geoff, would you say, so Texas completely shut down.
[53:15.920 --> 53:17.520]  This terrible, terrible thing's happening.
[53:18.060 --> 53:22.120]  Would you say the biggest loss for you during that time was you riding a bike?
[53:22.460 --> 53:24.360]  Is that the greatest consequence you suffered?
[53:24.500 --> 53:25.240]  Well, you didn't have power.
[53:25.480 --> 53:26.200]  You had to boil water.
[53:26.520 --> 53:27.820]  You didn't really stop him, did you?
[53:28.100 --> 53:28.340]  No.
[53:28.600 --> 53:30.740]  I mean, I still did my bike ride.
[53:30.980 --> 53:35.860]  Like, I remember getting on my bike and thinking, like, I want nothing more than to go home
[53:35.860 --> 53:39.480]  and peel these clothes off of my fucking scabs that are already forming.
[53:40.920 --> 53:43.000]  And run hot water over all of it.
[53:43.120 --> 53:44.860]  Here's a couple reasons why I didn't.
[53:44.980 --> 53:45.940]  There was no hot water.
[53:47.380 --> 53:50.340]  It's not like I could go home and there was a boil notice on.
[53:50.720 --> 53:53.740]  So any water, I was like, I could take a shower with cold,
[53:53.880 --> 53:56.160]  dirty water that'll probably infect my fucking skin.
[53:56.760 --> 54:00.080]  They specifically said don't shower if you have, like, open wounds.
[54:00.100 --> 54:01.540]  Open wounds and shit, which I did.
[54:01.620 --> 54:02.960]  I had a lot of all at once.
[54:03.200 --> 54:04.140]  You were a wound.
[54:04.700 --> 54:08.740]  Which I ultimately ended up doing anyway, because what else was I going to do?
[54:08.740 --> 54:13.440]  And then I just used I just doused my body in hydrogen peroxide a couple times a day.
[54:13.520 --> 54:20.280]  But anyway, yeah, I got I got up and I after I came to my senses and realized where I was
[54:20.280 --> 54:26.440]  and collected all my shit, I remember thinking about this time that I wrecked my bike in high
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.040]  school and I ripped my knee out like you can still see it.
[54:30.100 --> 54:31.280]  I have on my left knee.
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.800]  You can see I have a giant scar that's just scar tissue where my knee cap used to be.
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.860]  I lost the whole thing in one fell swoop, falling off my bike and getting drugged by it.
[54:40.960 --> 54:42.580]  And it just like it just it was gross, dude.
[54:42.580 --> 54:43.220]  I could see bone.
[54:43.320 --> 54:43.860]  It was a whole thing.
[54:44.280 --> 54:50.100]  Anyway, and I was walking home and I was about a mile and a half from home walking up a huge,
[54:50.920 --> 54:51.680]  huge hill.
[54:52.020 --> 54:58.640]  I might point out crying and like pushing my bike up a hill and it was all crooked and
[54:58.640 --> 54:58.920]  sideways.
[54:58.920 --> 55:05.160]  And my dad drives up in this 1971 red Ford Courier pickup truck.
[55:05.160 --> 55:06.260]  I'll never forget it.
[55:06.300 --> 55:10.580]  A big like not a big as a tiny little pickup truck, but had a bed, had a bed that would
[55:10.580 --> 55:11.100]  have held a bike.
[55:11.140 --> 55:11.760]  That's for sure.
[55:12.300 --> 55:13.400]  And he goes, what happened?
[55:13.780 --> 55:15.200]  He pulls up, pulls up by me in the truck.
[55:15.240 --> 55:15.760]  He goes, what happened?
[55:15.840 --> 55:16.920]  And I go, I fell off my bike.
[55:16.980 --> 55:17.800]  I'm hurt pretty bad.
[55:17.800 --> 55:20.320]  And he goes, well, bring it on home and we'll clean you up.
[55:20.360 --> 55:26.140]  And then he drove away and I had to walk the rest of the mile and a half up the hill, pushing
[55:26.140 --> 55:30.120]  a bike with now two flat tires, dripping blood down my leg.
[55:30.140 --> 55:33.720]  And I was thinking about that and I thought, yeah, I guess I'll just get back on my bike
[55:33.720 --> 55:34.660]  and finish my ride.
[55:36.080 --> 55:38.860]  That's what my, you know, because that's what my dad, that's what my dad would have made
[55:38.860 --> 55:40.080]  me like recommended I do.
[55:40.300 --> 55:43.920]  And so I just got back on my bike and finished my ride until it hurt too bad.
[55:44.120 --> 55:44.880]  You're no quitter.
[55:45.200 --> 55:47.360]  After about 20 miles, I was going to go for 25.
[55:47.520 --> 55:49.440]  After about 20 miles, I fucking packed it in.
[55:50.600 --> 55:55.800]  You somehow have the ability to get the most injured of the least movement possible.
[55:56.420 --> 55:59.740]  But remember when we put that video up of the rain run where you were?
[55:59.900 --> 56:01.700]  Oh, dude, it was it was raining.
[56:01.800 --> 56:02.760]  There was a lightning storm.
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.980]  And because I guess we were just children at the time, you decided that you wanted to
[56:07.980 --> 56:10.260]  run the run the street in the rain.
[56:10.280 --> 56:11.600]  And it was shit to get down.
[56:11.700 --> 56:13.540]  There was lightning every like five seconds.
[56:14.160 --> 56:20.140]  Geoff just disappears off into the darkness, into the mist of the rain and lightning comes
[56:20.140 --> 56:23.660]  back limping and covered in blood.
[56:24.640 --> 56:27.400]  And he was only gone for like 35 seconds.
[56:27.500 --> 56:28.120]  It came back.
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.960]  It looked like he'd been hit by a car.
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.420]  And then you ran into the bathroom, I guess, to tend your wounds.
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.940]  And then you slipped over in there and smashed your glass shelf.
[56:38.200 --> 56:40.460]  It was like you're a walking calamity.
[56:40.640 --> 56:44.780]  And then you came out and your towel fell off and you flashed me.
[56:45.060 --> 56:48.120]  It was it was a really eventful two to three minute period.
[56:48.520 --> 56:48.960]  Yeah.
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.340]  What actually happened?
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.740]  Because it's not on camera what you did.
[56:51.820 --> 56:52.560]  Where did you go?
[56:53.500 --> 56:54.720]  On the rain run thing?
[56:54.720 --> 57:02.100]  Oh, I ran across the street and I went to stop, you know, like to like hit the brakes.
[57:02.360 --> 57:05.340]  And I hit some gravel, like some wet gravel.
[57:05.580 --> 57:07.540]  And I just my legs slid out from under me.
[57:07.560 --> 57:12.940]  And I just slid my leg down the fucking down the street and then ripped all my I remember
[57:12.940 --> 57:15.860]  I was like, rip my jeans up and I had a fucking blood everywhere.
[57:15.980 --> 57:16.700]  And I came home.
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.360]  He just came back and he just goes, he just runs past me because I'm filming it.
[57:21.560 --> 57:23.640]  And he runs and says, I need to go to the hospital.
[57:24.720 --> 57:27.960]  And I get into the bathroom and I'm in like tremendous pain.
[57:28.100 --> 57:31.120]  I remember and there's like a glass shelf in that bathroom that holds
[57:32.840 --> 57:35.260]  like toothbrushes and deodorant and toothpaste and all that stuff.
[57:35.540 --> 57:39.000]  And I bit down to catch my breath because I thought I was going to throw up for a second
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.600]  from the pain, you know, like the pain and the shock.
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.880]  And so I was like, I was like, oh, and I put my head down, like, and I kind of breathe,
[57:46.940 --> 57:47.880]  you know, kind of catch my breath.
[57:48.060 --> 57:53.220]  And when I stood up, the back of my head hit that fucking glass at speed and knocked it.
[57:53.320 --> 57:53.920]  You did it with your head?
[57:53.920 --> 57:55.100]  I did with my head, yeah.
[57:55.860 --> 57:59.080]  And so I fucking, I actually, I don't think I even talked about it with you,
[57:59.140 --> 58:04.120]  but I cut the back of my head open on that sharp glass that night a little bit.
[58:04.240 --> 58:06.540]  It was just the least of my problems anyway.
[58:06.720 --> 58:08.460]  And so then I was barefoot at that point, naked.
[58:08.580 --> 58:10.660]  And then the glass shattered all around me.
[58:10.740 --> 58:13.340]  And so I was barefoot in the bathroom, covered in blood and wet,
[58:14.220 --> 58:15.340]  shattered glass all around me.
[58:15.360 --> 58:17.320]  And I couldn't move without like, it was...
[58:17.320 --> 58:20.800]  Oh, if you want to see the video of that, it's probably on YouTube.
[58:21.400 --> 58:24.420]  I guess just look for happy hour rain run, I think.
[58:25.100 --> 58:26.660]  I'll say this, that one sucked.
[58:26.960 --> 58:27.920]  This hurt way more.
[58:28.460 --> 58:28.880]  Oh, really?
[58:29.360 --> 58:31.120]  Yeah, this was way, this was pretty bad.
[58:31.300 --> 58:33.040]  You slammed into a pillar on this one.
[58:33.380 --> 58:34.560]  I feel like that's a whole other level.
[58:34.820 --> 58:37.760]  I was, I had to have the, like when I was standing there trying to like,
[58:38.360 --> 58:41.460]  trying to like build myself back up to get on the bike and be like,
[58:41.520 --> 58:42.540]  you're a tough guy, you can do it.
[58:42.600 --> 58:44.260]  You know, what would your dad, you know, I was doing the whole thing like,
[58:44.340 --> 58:47.180]  like your dad made you walk home with a fucking busted leg.
[58:47.240 --> 58:49.500]  You can get on your bike and ride it for, you know.
[58:49.500 --> 58:51.500]  And I was just thinking, I was like, you know, you're like,
[58:51.580 --> 58:53.000]  I already lost a pair of pants.
[58:53.220 --> 58:55.980]  I lost a pair of gloves and I lost a pair of socks on this ride.
[58:56.040 --> 58:57.640]  And I'm only 20 minutes in.
[58:57.680 --> 58:58.580]  I'm going to get my money's worth.
[58:58.780 --> 59:00.000]  I'm going to get my pants worth out of it.
[59:00.420 --> 59:03.820]  But yeah, no, this one, uh, this one, this one was pretty rough.
[59:04.720 --> 59:07.580]  I feel like a key detail that we kind of went over.
[59:07.680 --> 59:10.040]  You said your left sock, you lost your left sock.
[59:10.060 --> 59:12.420]  That improves your odds of grabbing.
[59:12.640 --> 59:13.420]  Well, I threw the pair away.
[59:13.640 --> 59:14.040]  Oh, okay.
[59:14.080 --> 59:14.500]  When I got home.
[59:14.680 --> 59:15.000]  Nevermind.
[59:15.180 --> 59:15.360]  Yeah.
[59:15.660 --> 59:16.540]  You didn't just keep a right?
[59:16.760 --> 59:17.280]  You just...
[59:17.280 --> 59:19.040]  No, I was, I was bummed too.
[59:19.100 --> 59:20.960]  Cause they were pretty, pretty good.
[59:21.060 --> 59:21.680]  New socks.
[59:21.840 --> 59:23.200]  I hadn't had them that long.
[59:25.260 --> 59:27.040]  What was the last time you bought socks?
[59:27.240 --> 59:30.220]  The such, maybe the fucking most boring question I've ever asked.
[59:30.300 --> 59:30.600]  Yesterday.
[59:30.920 --> 59:30.940]  Ever.
[59:31.420 --> 59:31.820]  Yesterday.
[59:31.980 --> 59:32.600]  What about you, Gavin?
[59:32.940 --> 59:34.260]  I subscribe to socks.
[59:34.580 --> 59:35.060]  Oh, really?
[59:35.480 --> 59:35.720]  Okay.
[59:35.880 --> 59:36.020]  Yeah.
[59:36.040 --> 59:39.800]  So every month I'll get a, uh, one pair of socks, same with underwear.
[59:39.800 --> 59:43.840]  And then I'll go into my drawer and I'll find the shittiest, like,
[59:43.840 --> 59:47.600]  hole-filled pair of socks that I've probably had since 2007.
[59:48.180 --> 59:49.200]  And I'll chuck those away.
[59:49.440 --> 59:51.140]  And I'm just slowly replacing my socks.
[59:51.380 --> 59:52.360]  I do something similar.
[59:52.820 --> 59:54.560]  Uh, the way Gavin does it is very smart.
[59:54.720 --> 59:55.980]  I just do it like once a year.
[59:56.160 --> 59:58.120]  I'll just buy all new underwear and all new socks.
[59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.260]  And then when they come in, I'll just get rid of the other stuff.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.940]  To me, it's a, it's a psychological thing.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.400]  Like I can't stand to throw away stuff in bulk.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.140]  Like if I, if I was just going to grab 20 pairs of socks and throw them all in the bin.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.480]  Just feels, I don't know.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.180]  It feels wasteful in a weird way.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.320]  Even though I'm doing it slowly over time.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.500]  I understand that.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.040]  I understand that.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.460]  But also, like, maybe it's just how I'm living.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.900]  But socks get holes in them really fast now too.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.100]  So I feel like I'm blowing through socks pretty quickly because of holes.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.080]  Is it because you're spending less time in shoes?
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.200]  Maybe it's because I'm spending less time in shoes.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.640]  Or maybe it's because I'm spending a lot of time sliding across pavement.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.100]  I don't know.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.520]  Yeah, that could be a factor.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.180]  A bit of both.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.900]  I'm not a socks guy, generally speaking.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.140]  I'm never wearing socks.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.060]  The only time I'll put socks on is when I'm going to somebody else's house.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.360]  I would rather, unless I'm swimming, I would rather have socks and shoes on.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.560]  The only time I'd prefer to be barefoot would be in water.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.120]  I don't know why you like wearing shoes in the house though.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.300]  I'm wearing, yeah, I don't know.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.460]  I'll wear them till I go to bed.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.860]  I'll take off my shoes to go to bed.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.460]  I just feel like it's, you're gonna have like an overly sweaty foot for no reason.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.440]  I don't though.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.400]  I'm not like you.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.960]  For whatever reason, like, I don't have the same issues.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.160]  I don't wear shoes in my house.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:06.560]  It's weird.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.280]  It's outside.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.220]  There's germs from like the street and dog shit and like public bogs all on the bottom of shoes.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.080]  I don't want that on my nice, I don't know, office carpet.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:16.640]  It's rank.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.120]  No, I understand that for sure.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.860]  That's why I don't, I can't stand.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.440]  I can't stand when I see people walk around with their shoes untied.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:26.300]  Like they don't care.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.420]  Because you know, you know that shoe lace gets trapped under that shoe and it gets piss on it
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:40.060]  and it gets doody on it and it gets like all kinds of gross juice from like the ground.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.640]  I'm telling you though, if you've got shoelaces on your shoes, they're covered in piss.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:45.760]  That's just how it works.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.080]  It doesn't have to be if you keep them tied, dude.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:48.920]  No, it does.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.880]  Look, if you, if you use a urinal or a urinal, people will make fun of the way I say that.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.060]  The splash, the top of your shoes are as mingling as the underneath.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.260]  It doesn't matter if your shoelace is tied.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.500]  If you stand up and pee in a urinal now.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.300]  I, listen, I have fully, fully embraced the bidet.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.760]  I am not going to pass up an opportunity to sit on a warm toilet.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.660]  I'm a sit down peer most of the time now.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.880]  I have been for many years.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.280]  Yeah, because the fucking toilet makes it so much fun.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.360]  I didn't realize this as well.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.880]  Apparently you get more out of your bladder if you, if you're sat down.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:29.480]  Because the way it folds, um, if you're stood up, you can't empty the bottom bit of your bladder
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.120]  just because of physics.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.600]  I didn't know that.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.880]  I don't even know if that's important or if it has any effect on it.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.560]  But I like pissing sitting down.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.380]  It means you have to wash the bog less as well.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.040]  Oh, totally.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.780]  Yeah, you can be more precise with it.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.800]  You can like, you get both hands free to play on your phone.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:49.500]  Also, very often when I sit down to pee, have a happy little like sit down pee,
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.720]  I'll pop out a little, a little surprise poop too, you know, get that out of the way.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.460]  Then you're like, you feel better about yourself.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.500]  Like, I didn't even know I had that in me and I needed to get rid of it.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.180]  But now it's gone.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.460]  I feel a little bit lighter on my feet.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.460]  Can't do that standing up.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.360]  Well, you can.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.580]  No, you shouldn't.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:03.720]  Definitely shouldn't.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:07.140]  Does every, do toilet companies make urinals?
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.280]  Is there a urinal company?
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:08.780]  Yeah.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:09.360]  Yeah.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.900]  It's just, they make everything.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.760]  There's not like a specific...
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.340]  Armature shanks.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.940]  It's not like an Android and Apple scenario of the toilet world
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.540]  that there's like only a urinal company.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:19.560]  I don't think so.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.300]  Maybe.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.960]  I feel like if you're making urinals, you're making bogs.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.980]  It makes sense to do both.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:26.720]  Part and parcel.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:27.220]  Yeah.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:27.540]  Yeah.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.620]  It seems like you need to leave money on the table otherwise.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.840]  Like you already have access to the location.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.360]  They're already hiring you to do half the job.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.020]  I'm sure if you're specking out a new building,
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.740]  you don't want to talk to two different companies for one bathroom.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.040]  You probably don't, no.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.480]  You want to do a company that's gonna...
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.840]  You don't want to have a tile guy and a sink guy and a towel dispenser guy
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.140]  and a toilet guy and a urinal guy.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.120]  Dyson Airblade guy.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.080]  Yeah.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.700]  It's a lot of guys.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.500]  So, uh...
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.640]  I'm sorry. I was just looking at your...
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.200]  There's a urinal that's more expensive than a port-a-potty.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.300]  This is crazy.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.240]  So are we just not going to address Andrew's name?
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.440]  We can talk about it.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.640]  Yeah, I mean, there was...
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.320]  Eric will be telling us to end it at this point.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.500]  The whole reason we were fucking...
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.160]  We recorded this early.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.460]  No, it was for the port-a-potty.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.000]  It had nothing to do with your name.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.420]  So we got that.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.580]  But Andrew just...
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.560]  When our power's off, Andrew just made...
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:30.780]  The person who edited episode 38 of F***face didn't have time to upload it before the power went out.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.200]  It was sat there on a computer that couldn't be turned on.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.840]  I assume an internet that didn't work.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.200]  So Andrew made a small piece to go up in its place, letting people know that it'll be delayed.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.100]  I did.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.940]  Once again, very courteous person thinking about everybody else.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.140]  What did you say in that piece for the people that are listening now that may not have heard it?
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:56.960]  Well, I may have revealed or said, claimed, that Andrew Payton is an alias.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.260]  And, like, stage name of sorts.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.740]  And is not my real name.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.160]  My real name.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.200]  And the proposed audio is Raymond Somer.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.160]  I don't see why this is crazy.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.180]  I played...
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.760]  I played that to Meg.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.780]  And she was just, like, sat back, you know, just, like, listening.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.760]  When you said that, she, like, leapt forward on the couch and was like,
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.920]  No. There's no way.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.140]  Yeah. It's a thing that happened.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.940]  And I was like, there's no way.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.900]  Well, maybe... how do we want to do... do you want to ask questions about it?
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.240]  Because I feel like there's doubt by both of you.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.600]  Independently, I got a lot of suspicion. Understandable.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.000]  If it was a bit, I would say it wasn't a bit.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:36.960]  So I get it.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.080]  Wait, are you telling us how you're going to lie about it?
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.520]  No, I'm saying if it... if I was doing a bit, if this was a bit, I would...
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.560]  Then you would lie and say it wasn't a bit.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.840]  I would claim it wasn't a bit.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.460]  So I understand the suspicion.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.540]  Which makes it difficult for us to get to the bottom of
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.920]  whether you're actually named Raymond Sommer or not.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.920]  Yeah. Because if it was a bit, I'd say it wasn't a bit.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.020]  But you already had that Twitter account?
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.700]  Yeah. Well, I had... Okay. So do we want to get into the history of... of the all of this?
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.060]  Is this for next episode?
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:13.280]  Are you maintaining that you were born Raymond Sommer, not Andrew Panton?
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.000]  I'm saying it's not impossible.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.220]  We're going to get nothing out of him, Geoff.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.340]  No, it's...
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.020]  Well, thanks for tuning in for another episode of Face.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.760]  I believe this was episode 40.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.320]  I hope you had a good time.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:28.780]  Next week, we'll intend to get to the bottom of this.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.180]  But we did this week as well.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:30.880]  And here we are.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.680]  Thanks for listening.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:39.140]  And like and subscribe or send us a rate your way or their way or whose way.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.040]  Hey, see you next week.
