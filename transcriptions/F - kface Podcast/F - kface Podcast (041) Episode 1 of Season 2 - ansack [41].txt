[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  You don't technically need this car. You say that out loud to yourself.
[00:04.880 --> 00:08.640]  You say, I have no space. You say, eh, I'm just looking.
[00:09.060 --> 00:13.940]  Then you click. Then you zoom in on photo number 87 and whisper, oh no.
[00:14.360 --> 00:16.900]  Then you text a friend, the one who always enables you.
[00:17.220 --> 00:21.960]  You say to yourself, this is the last one, knowing it is not.
[00:22.460 --> 00:27.580]  You don't need this car. But maybe, just maybe, this car needs you.
[00:27.580 --> 00:30.080]  Bring a trailer. It's never just a car.
[00:31.220 --> 00:34.680]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:46.250 --> 00:51.190]  Jesus fucking Christ, dude. I'm so like... I should have just fucking missed this one too.
[00:51.370 --> 00:54.150]  Like, what a joke. Are you fucking kidding me?
[00:54.290 --> 00:55.650]  I'm just gonna start recording.
[00:55.670 --> 00:56.490]  Are you kidding me?
[00:56.610 --> 00:59.450]  No, what do you mean? I'm not the fucking sound guy.
[00:59.530 --> 01:02.310]  You guys are saying I'm low, so I twisted the note a little bit.
[01:02.450 --> 01:06.570]  Every single week. Okay, it's 3.04. This has gotta be the episode now. It's 3.04.
[01:06.570 --> 01:08.230]  Oh yeah, we're in the episode.
[01:08.710 --> 01:13.270]  Last week I talked about moving on time to be 3.01, and it was still not enough.
[01:13.550 --> 01:15.170]  I was here at 3 anyway, just to be safe.
[01:15.310 --> 01:22.830]  I assumed that because we recorded an episode two days ago at this point, Andrew's shit would still be functioning.
[01:23.270 --> 01:24.670]  Absolutely not. Impossible.
[01:24.910 --> 01:29.510]  Okay, well apparently it was never fixed. That's not my fault. I can't hear what I sound like.
[01:29.710 --> 01:32.690]  It's based on you. I was here 30 minutes early.
[01:32.830 --> 01:36.070]  You can see your waveforms in Audacity. That's how you know...
[01:36.070 --> 01:38.810]  I don't... I don't know how to read waveforms.
[01:39.070 --> 01:41.330]  It's not language. You just look.
[01:42.710 --> 01:47.190]  Yeah, but I don't know. See, now I feel like I'm coming in super hot, but before I'm too low.
[01:47.270 --> 01:49.070]  I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make people...
[01:49.070 --> 01:53.650]  It's the salad cream all over again. I'm trying to make you happy. I don't know how to do it.
[01:53.710 --> 01:56.910]  I do one thing, it's wrong. I do another thing, it's wrong. What do you want from me?
[01:56.930 --> 02:02.550]  And we've just had to let Eric know that not only did we not talk about your name, Andrew,
[02:02.550 --> 02:06.270]  we didn't even talk about the three-letter acronym.
[02:06.710 --> 02:09.730]  As a matter of fact, Eric, Eric, I'm glad you're here.
[02:10.670 --> 02:14.970]  Andrew and Gavin and I, we'd like to talk to you. This comes from a place of love,
[02:15.290 --> 02:20.750]  but I think we need to have a bit of an intervention in your inability to keep us on track
[02:20.750 --> 02:25.830]  because we have now blown two very important things that absolutely should have been talked about.
[02:25.870 --> 02:29.770]  And as the producer, I feel like it's on you to keep us on track.
[02:29.770 --> 02:34.850]  Hang on, Geoff is saying me keeping you on track and Gavin is saying attendance.
[02:35.270 --> 02:38.270]  They go hand in hand. They're both, they're the same thing.
[02:38.470 --> 02:41.570]  You can't keep us on track if there's no attendance.
[02:42.210 --> 02:42.990]  Do you? It's really.
[02:43.150 --> 02:48.790]  Nobody listening to this knows how fucking hard it was to schedule any of the fucking shows for this week.
[02:49.090 --> 02:53.210]  And it still wasn't set by the time this was all happening.
[02:53.690 --> 02:59.430]  Like, this was like, oh, are we recording at 5am? No, why would we do that?
[02:59.430 --> 03:03.310]  Okay, well, I'll be there at 5am. Why are we doing this?
[03:03.690 --> 03:09.010]  Nobody was at the 5am record again this morning. Once again, just saying, nobody was there.
[03:09.090 --> 03:09.830]  Wait, what? Why?
[03:11.330 --> 03:15.130]  It was the perfect attendance by me. I was there every time nobody else was there.
[03:15.230 --> 03:17.430]  That's not even...
[03:18.070 --> 03:22.630]  A part of your intervention also, Eric, is reining Andrew's attendance thing in a little bit.
[03:22.810 --> 03:25.030]  He keeps showing up at 5am for no reason.
[03:25.190 --> 03:26.250]  He's over attending.
[03:26.250 --> 03:31.410]  I have said over and over that we're not doing anything at that time. Don't, like, no.
[03:31.730 --> 03:34.570]  It does not matter. It doesn't matter.
[03:35.890 --> 03:39.650]  Andrew, are you tired again because of that? Did you sleep in the tub and get a shit night's sleep?
[03:39.750 --> 03:42.250]  No, no, no, I didn't sleep in the tub. I'm good.
[03:42.470 --> 03:48.930]  You literally asked us last night if we're doing the 5am thing. I said, only if you live in Japan.
[03:49.250 --> 03:50.970]  And I thought that was a pretty clear answer.
[03:51.510 --> 03:57.130]  Okay, well, do we want to be serious about this? Or what do we want to do here?
[03:57.450 --> 03:59.910]  I still don't have a port-a-potty, by the way.
[03:59.930 --> 04:02.010]  Yeah, okay, well, we can talk about that as well.
[04:02.810 --> 04:04.730]  The 5am thing, obviously ridiculous.
[04:05.070 --> 04:06.050]  I was just trying to get somebody else...
[04:06.050 --> 04:11.610]  Talk about the SMH! Talk about Raymond Sommer! What are you talking about? This is insane!
[04:11.690 --> 04:12.610]  Well, you gave away SMH.
[04:12.610 --> 04:14.750]  Well, you gave it away. It was SMH.
[04:14.750 --> 04:21.730]  Boy, we really... I was just having a conversation with Gavin earlier, right before this podcast started,
[04:21.830 --> 04:25.070]  where I said, you know, I was listening to this week's episode and then next week's,
[04:25.090 --> 04:30.330]  and I don't think we ever got back around and said what that three-letter acronym or those three letters were,
[04:30.870 --> 04:33.210]  and Eric blew his fucking top.
[04:33.510 --> 04:35.490]  Yeah, he went red and steam came out.
[04:35.590 --> 04:43.450]  And I think what we need is a brief, previously on f***face, that is cut together just for us to listen to right before we start.
[04:43.930 --> 04:50.390]  Because we are utterly useless. The only stuff we hear, we end up catching up on the ones two weeks ago,
[04:50.410 --> 04:53.450]  because that's the ones that usually just come out while we record.
[04:53.630 --> 04:58.950]  So we're always in this weird week gap hole where we don't address anything from the previous episode.
[04:59.210 --> 05:05.550]  It's funny, a couple episodes ago, I said, at this point now, I said, we're as dumb as we'll ever be about our own show,
[05:05.610 --> 05:10.630]  and I felt pretty safe saying that. We knocked that out of the park instantly.
[05:11.090 --> 05:13.870]  We are so much dumber about our show than we were two weeks ago.
[05:14.290 --> 05:22.170]  When you said that you recorded on an off day, at a time where I had to pull teeth to get an answer on any phone,
[05:22.330 --> 05:28.870]  anyone was going to show up, and you didn't talk about the stuff that was the whole reason for the episode,
[05:29.350 --> 05:34.250]  I, like, I lost, I stood up. Like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
[05:34.630 --> 05:38.050]  What am I supposed to do? Talk about it. This is insane.
[05:38.050 --> 05:45.750]  I gotta be honest with you. I, I, uh, I agree. That's why I wish you would have been there.
[05:46.630 --> 05:52.390]  That was even the whole point. I was like, I don't want to do it on Tuesday because Eric won't be there and Nick can't be there.
[05:52.850 --> 05:55.230]  Because I don't trust us anymore.
[05:55.450 --> 06:02.090]  Is it, is it dumber that I thought about it and didn't bring it up that I was waiting for the episode to come out before we talked about it?
[06:02.290 --> 06:03.550]  I'm so mad at you. I'm so mad at you.
[06:03.550 --> 06:06.610]  I was, like, why, it never even occurred to me to bring it up.
[06:06.610 --> 06:10.350]  I saw the doorbells ringing. This better not be a goddamn port-a-potty.
[06:10.690 --> 06:13.450]  I don't think it would be there that soon.
[06:13.590 --> 06:21.330]  Eric, I'm scrolling back through the slack where you were trying to, really working hard to nail down a time for us to do this additional episode that we sprung on you.
[06:21.730 --> 06:27.590]  And it just goes in the worst circles. At one point, you just wrote, this sucks.
[06:27.950 --> 06:32.670]  And then you, and then, like, 18 lines down, you wrote, I hate this.
[06:33.230 --> 06:37.390]  You can tell just by that, the direction that was going.
[06:37.710 --> 06:39.750]  Because Geoff wouldn't agree to anything.
[06:39.890 --> 06:43.310]  No! At all! He put maybe! Maybe attending.
[06:43.730 --> 06:45.250]  What does that do for us?
[06:45.550 --> 06:52.290]  I, as a joke, said 5 a.m. because you said early. Andrew then ran with 5 a.m. He was obsessed with getting up at 5.
[06:52.390 --> 06:54.090]  It went nowhere, I can't believe it.
[06:54.330 --> 06:59.330]  And it's, and it's like that, so when it's like, yeah, wrangle us, what does that, what, how?
[06:59.610 --> 07:01.190]  Do, to do, how? How?
[07:01.550 --> 07:09.330]  Well, I feel like if you were in the recording, if you'd actually, if we were able to schedule at a time where you and Nick were available, we definitely would have talked about SMH.
[07:09.510 --> 07:11.930]  By the way, it was SMH. I feel like we've mentioned that at this point.
[07:12.050 --> 07:19.930]  Yeah. I don't know if, well, I may have fought against that. In my head, it made more sense to wait until they responded. The audience heard it and then responded.
[07:20.170 --> 07:21.850]  They all got it. So many of them got it.
[07:21.990 --> 07:27.090]  Why, why would it make more sense for the audience, why, and then so you wait two weeks? Why does that make more sense?
[07:27.090 --> 07:32.590]  Yeah, well, because the whole point of the thing was if people could figure out if, if what it was or not.
[07:32.730 --> 07:34.270]  But what does that change for the audience?
[07:34.650 --> 07:39.350]  But what, but well, why would we talk about it again before that?
[07:39.530 --> 07:43.330]  Because it's a week-to-week podcast, not an every-two-week podcast.
[07:43.730 --> 07:48.570]  I don't think it's worth talking about three weeks in a row, though. I think it's worth waiting.
[07:48.590 --> 07:50.150]  You just have to talk about it one time.
[07:50.610 --> 07:52.410]  You just have to talk about it on the next one.
[07:52.410 --> 07:58.430]  No, under your scenario, we would talk about it the second week. We'd be like, oh, this is what the word was.
[07:58.490 --> 08:03.970]  And then they would react. And then I'd talk about it again on the third week being like, I guess I'm a pretty good actor.
[08:04.090 --> 08:07.610]  I didn't think I did that great. Almost everyone seemed to got it.
[08:07.930 --> 08:11.250]  Yeah, I feel like I was good in my performance. So then we have three weeks of it.
[08:11.250 --> 08:20.390]  We haven't overtly discussed that we had like a 15-minute argument on which episode we would reveal the results to a vote that we took.
[08:20.390 --> 08:24.850]  That was recorded in the episode. It was already revealed.
[08:25.330 --> 08:26.950]  Immediately before the argument.
[08:27.450 --> 08:29.910]  Yeah, but if that wasn't, it would have been edited.
[08:30.130 --> 08:30.970]  We are so stupid.
[08:31.010 --> 08:34.390]  Yeah, I just don't know if we... would it have been edited? Could we just put it out?
[08:35.210 --> 08:36.270]  No, I think it wouldn't have been.
[08:36.270 --> 08:40.410]  The whole point was that if we... I mean, it was a stupid thing, but...
[08:40.410 --> 08:50.230]  Like at the time, the only people on the planet who didn't know was me and Geoff. And you, I guess, as well.
[08:50.770 --> 08:55.350]  But we were arguing on behalf of the audience, like, oh, they won't like it if we leave them hanging. They already do.
[08:55.790 --> 08:56.590]  They already do.
[08:56.630 --> 09:04.050]  That might have been the dumbest moment. And I'd like to be able to say, oh, you know, I was talking about our reactions to it. They want to hear our reactions.
[09:04.410 --> 09:04.490]  No.
[09:04.690 --> 09:08.550]  Nope. Didn't even think of it. I just didn't know myself. And I thought no one else did.
[09:09.210 --> 09:15.530]  No, same. I was listening to the episode, and I got to that point, and I thought, wait a minute. And I immediately texted Gavin.
[09:15.770 --> 09:22.570]  And I said, correct me if I'm wrong, but are we the dumbest people ever? And Gavin was like, motherfucker.
[09:24.410 --> 09:26.730]  It didn't make any sense, but I feel like it would have been edited.
[09:26.890 --> 09:28.090]  How fucking stupid are we?
[09:28.150 --> 09:29.010]  I mean, we're really dumb.
[09:29.010 --> 09:39.950]  Hey, so I was gone for a second, dealing with a door-to-door salesman, unfortunately. Thank God it wasn't a porta potty. What'd I miss? Did you guys cover the three letters in the Raymond Sommer thing yet?
[09:40.010 --> 09:44.350]  Yeah, I mean, Eric already said it, but yeah, it was SMH. The audience did get it.
[09:44.710 --> 09:45.310]  Yeah, a lot of them did.
[09:45.770 --> 09:45.790]  Yeah.
[09:45.790 --> 09:46.230]  They were smart.
[09:46.930 --> 09:50.830]  Geoff, do you think it's worth talking three weeks in a row about, though? That bit?
[09:50.850 --> 09:51.370]  About what?
[09:51.990 --> 09:52.790]  About SMH?
[09:53.190 --> 09:57.070]  I don't think we need to dissect it and talk about it in depth.
[09:57.070 --> 09:59.630]  Wait, why would it be three weeks in a row?
[09:59.710 --> 10:00.090]  I don't know.
[10:00.350 --> 10:02.170]  It doesn't matter. Like, it doesn't matter.
[10:02.270 --> 10:08.770]  No, no, it would be three weeks, because if we would have mentioned it, the one we recorded last, that's the next episode to come out, I believe.
[10:09.570 --> 10:16.530]  So that'd be second. If we did, though. If we did, though, that'd be two. And then I'd talk about it again on this one.
[10:16.570 --> 10:17.990]  Why would you talk about it a third time?
[10:18.510 --> 10:25.630]  Because about my performance. About how people got it. Because we didn't know until this recording that people got it.
[10:25.630 --> 10:25.890]  They did.
[10:25.890 --> 10:30.670]  So it ended up being talked about three times. I think that's too much. This is currently being talked about twice.
[10:30.910 --> 10:34.170]  This one started in such a mess that I don't think it had an intro again.
[10:34.430 --> 10:35.050]  No, it didn't.
[10:35.090 --> 10:48.830]  Hello, and welcome to F*** Face, episode 41, I want to say. My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Gavin Free and, uh, International Man of Mystery, sir.
[10:49.010 --> 10:53.250]  I asked you what to call you last week. You never gave me a clear answer. I'll ask you again.
[10:53.250 --> 10:57.490]  Do we refer to you as Andrew? Do we refer to you as Raymond? And either way, why?
[10:57.510 --> 11:00.670]  You can call me whatever you want to call me. I'm open to either. It's whatever you prefer.
[11:00.950 --> 11:02.890]  Are we going to get into this now, or are we going to wait for later?
[11:02.890 --> 11:05.790]  Yeah, let's do it. Who knows? We might not get to it.
[11:05.790 --> 11:07.930]  You absolutely cannot wait to talk about it.
[11:07.930 --> 11:08.350]  Are you sure?
[11:08.530 --> 11:12.150]  That is some excellent producing by Eric's part. Good job, Eric.
[11:12.150 --> 11:16.170]  Okay, well, how do we want it? Do we just want the whole story?
[11:16.570 --> 11:21.470]  Like, I guess, first of all, I should say that I'm going to tell this story. I'm going to explain what happened.
[11:21.930 --> 11:27.550]  I don't really care if people believe me or not. Also, I'm not really asking for people to investigate deeply into this.
[11:27.610 --> 11:31.370]  It's just I'm going to tell the story. If you want to believe it, you can believe it. If you don't, that's fine.
[11:31.870 --> 11:40.290]  Do whatever you want to do with it. But, my real name is Raymond Somer, and I've gone by that name between the ages of one to ten.
[11:40.290 --> 11:47.470]  And I didn't change until Andrew Panton, until a little after I met you guys. And it was a panic move, because I did.
[11:47.650 --> 11:49.930]  So, wait, you weren't named until you were one?
[11:50.210 --> 11:52.450]  Well, whatever. You know, I'm talking here, Gavin.
[11:52.510 --> 11:54.210]  So, birth to ten is what you're trying to say?
[11:54.330 --> 12:00.910]  Birth to ten, yeah. There wasn't a name change. I don't have a name. Not a double. But, yeah, that was my name.
[12:01.470 --> 12:03.850]  That's like the idea if you got born a year old.
[12:04.290 --> 12:17.470]  So, let me ask you a question. Is it possible that at some point in time, the Vancouver police were looking for Raymond Somer, the Vancouver child kicker, and that's why you changed your name?
[12:17.770 --> 12:24.690]  No, I mean, no comment to that, maybe, possibly. I don't, I won't know. You know what, actually, I'm going to go on the record and say I've never kicked a child.
[12:25.110 --> 12:31.590]  I'd just like that to be known. It has never happened. I considered it, it got close once, but I've never kicked a kid.
[12:31.590 --> 12:43.250]  So, to that point, if you're a child, or at some point, if you are listening to this podcast, and at some point you were a child, or you are indeed still a child, and you've been kicked by Andrew Panton, we'd like to hear your story.
[12:43.530 --> 12:57.270]  You're not going to hear anybody. Nobody, there's no, I've never kicked a kid. But, so for the name thing, I'm Raymond Somer, and then I got on Xbox when I was 11, and my gamertag was ANSAC something.
[12:57.590 --> 12:58.410]  What does that mean?
[12:58.570 --> 12:59.670]  It was ANSAC 13.
[12:59.670 --> 13:11.290]  No, I changed it every year because I was super cool. I started as ANSAC 11. I don't know what it meant. It was a nickname I got as a kid, when I was like 5 or 6 maybe, and it just stuck.
[13:11.490 --> 13:17.070]  So, as a small 5-year-old, 6-year-old kid called Raymond, your nickname was ANSAC.
[13:17.070 --> 13:29.130]  Yep, no idea what it meant. One person gave it to me, it's what they called me, so it was sort of like my name thing. And then it sucked because, like I was, okay, so I loved Halo so much, like that was my thing growing up.
[13:29.230 --> 13:41.190]  And I was so excited to get Xbox Live, and my cousin also really liked it, and we're talking about how like you have to have a gamertag online, and he wanted us to use our gamertag name so we'd get comfortable saying it online.
[13:41.190 --> 13:51.250]  Except his was just Bobslayer, and his name wasn't Bob. So I just called him Bob, and I had to be called ANSAC, which was a really shitty exchange. Ridiculous name.
[13:51.750 --> 14:01.050]  So I was ANSAC for a long time, and my obsession was Halo, and I loved Bungie. This is sort of just a pivot to how I met you guys as well.
[14:01.050 --> 14:09.930]  So I watched Red vs. Blue, like season three maybe? A few episodes? And I enjoyed it because I loved Halo stuff. And then it just kind of was something I didn't think about.
[14:10.270 --> 14:20.410]  And then years pass, I love Halo 2, there is a bonus disc, I had the collector's edition, and there's a collector, like a B-roll on that disc, like a documentary of making the game.
[14:20.850 --> 14:28.350]  And my goal was to play with somebody from Bungie. So I wrote down the names on the B-roll, most of them didn't work, I found one that worked.
[14:28.350 --> 14:35.530]  I sent a random friend request to somebody, it was just the shortest name of the most recently played to that person.
[14:35.970 --> 14:45.030]  They sent me an invite later, I'm freaking out, I don't know what to do. I join the game, they say, hey, I never accept random friend requests, who are you?
[14:45.490 --> 14:54.790]  I'm like 13, maybe, at this time? 12? I completely panic, I lie, and I just tell them, yeah, we played a game before, and you seemed cool, so I sent you a friend request.
[14:54.790 --> 14:59.250]  That was not at all, I just saw it was a Bungie connected thing through the disc. Smooth.
[14:59.510 --> 15:04.550]  Yeah, that person turned out to be Nico, who did all the music for Red vs. Blue. No shit!
[15:05.270 --> 15:12.110]  Yeah, so it was a complete accident, and he mentioned something about his boss just signed on, and I asked, oh, that's weird.
[15:12.390 --> 15:18.070]  As a kid, I thought it was strange to have your boss as a friend on Xbox. He was like, yeah, I do the music for Red vs. Blue.
[15:18.670 --> 15:22.870]  I was like, oh, that's awesome, because I had a vague awareness of it, but I didn't really know anything about it.
[15:22.870 --> 15:27.890]  And that's what got me back into the community. Then I became good friends with Nico, and we played games a lot.
[15:28.010 --> 15:33.730]  Then I met Luke McKay through him, who used to do the comic. We became friends, and then Grifball came out.
[15:34.110 --> 15:43.010]  And it's around this time that my fandom for Rooster Teeth stuff in general increased, and I made this super embarrassing fan map.
[15:43.250 --> 15:47.570]  Just real quick, before you go any further, if you're listening to this and you're not sure what Grifball or that is,
[15:48.090 --> 15:55.670]  Red vs. Blue, obviously a cartoon that we filmed in a video game called Halo. Within Halo, you could make your own game types,
[15:55.830 --> 15:59.930]  and we created one called Grifball. Gavin actually did, I did not. Gavin and Bernie did.
[16:00.010 --> 16:04.950]  That ended up becoming an official game type in Halo, and so that's what Andrew's referring to.
[16:05.250 --> 16:12.750]  Yes. So it was sort of before that time, though, I was friends with Nico and Luke, and I made this map that was super embarrassing,
[16:12.750 --> 16:20.230]  as Ansac. They met me as Ansac. When you made a map, it was connected to your profile, and as I started meeting more people in the community,
[16:20.350 --> 16:29.550]  I was so embarrassed by it. I was like, I can't figure out how to delete this. I'm just gonna change my name so it's not listed as me as the creator of this thing that I'm embarrassed of.
[16:29.910 --> 16:38.050]  And that's where Andrew Panton came from. Panton was the last name of somebody I went to school with, and Andrew was just a name of a family member.
[16:38.050 --> 16:45.930]  So I flipped it to Andrew Panton at that point. Just kind of had a vague connection with people, but then Grifball came out, and I ended up being one of the better Grifball players,
[16:46.070 --> 16:52.470]  and Luke McKay asked me to be in a tournament that you guys were running. And then because I was one of the better players, I ended up on Bernie's team,
[16:52.870 --> 17:00.190]  and then we started playing games a lot and became good friends. And then through that, I think it was at the time you were doing the 10,000 gamerscore thing, Geoff?
[17:00.330 --> 17:02.650]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, you and I were buddies then, at that point.
[17:02.650 --> 17:09.370]  No, I met you around that time because I think Bernie was trying to mess with you, and he was talking to me about different ways.
[17:09.550 --> 17:14.470]  I'm just assuming that's how that came up, and he was talking to me about it, and I think he talked to you about it.
[17:14.810 --> 17:21.790]  And so then you messaged me at around that time. So then we became friends through that. Anyway, I guess the point is that I didn't mean to meet any of you people.
[17:21.890 --> 17:27.830]  I was just trying to play with Bungie, and then I ended up here. It was a total accident.
[17:27.830 --> 17:34.890]  So then the Twitter account. So I became friends with all of you, Geoff and Gavin, and we would talk on aim a lot.
[17:34.990 --> 17:41.730]  And then I went through this thing. I forgot my password. That's what happened. For like six or seven months, I couldn't remember my password.
[17:42.130 --> 17:49.250]  And then I finally remembered it, and I signed on. And I always had this anxiety thing of sometimes you get feelings like,
[17:49.330 --> 17:53.230]  oh, your friends don't really like you, and you're more of a burden to them, like they tolerate you.
[17:53.530 --> 17:54.850]  I think Gavin feels that a lot.
[17:57.090 --> 18:01.930]  So I didn't talk to any of you for like six months, and I signed on to aim. I didn't have any messages.
[18:02.050 --> 18:07.570]  So I just interpreted that as like, oh, I guess I like burn bridges somehow in some like social way.
[18:07.730 --> 18:14.510]  So I just didn't talk to any of you for like two years. There was like a two-year break from like 2013 to 2015.
[18:15.270 --> 18:20.310]  No communication. That's when I made the Raymond Sillmayer Twitter account, because I thought about then using it,
[18:20.310 --> 18:25.470]  because I had no reason to continue to be Andrew Pantin at that point. But I'm just not a social media guy.
[18:25.570 --> 18:30.810]  Like my Andrew Pantin account has maybe 500 tweets in like 10 plus years of existing.
[18:31.030 --> 18:36.410]  And almost all of them at this point are related to the show. So I made the account, didn't really use it.
[18:36.770 --> 18:44.210]  And then what happened was in 2015, playing Destiny, Geoff randomly joined my game when I was doing a daily.
[18:44.710 --> 18:47.270]  And I thought, oh, I guess Geoff doesn't hate me. That's all.
[18:48.430 --> 18:53.650]  Nope, still never hated you. By the way, just for the audience, and we've talked about this before,
[18:54.090 --> 18:58.890]  I was under the impression we were very good friends this entire time. I just was busy with work,
[18:58.910 --> 19:05.110]  and I assumed Andrew was busy with what he was doing. At no point was I avoiding or ignoring you.
[19:05.670 --> 19:08.370]  I just never saw you online on AIM. You were just never around.
[19:08.390 --> 19:14.050]  No, it's totally justified. It was just an in-my-head anxiety thing, but I didn't talk to anybody for like two years.
[19:14.050 --> 19:18.750]  I would have never talked to anyone again, because I guess that's done.
[19:19.230 --> 19:23.410]  And then you joined that game in Destiny, and I messaged you on AIM the next day,
[19:23.470 --> 19:25.130]  and we've talked regularly since then.
[19:25.470 --> 19:29.570]  Can I just say whether that's true or not, and I certainly think elements of it are true,
[19:29.690 --> 19:38.150]  maybe even the majority of it is true. In all seriousness, I think that making the music for Red vs. Blue
[19:38.150 --> 19:41.410]  is now the second coolest thing Nico has done for me.
[19:45.010 --> 19:47.170]  Wow, that was quite the story.
[19:47.410 --> 19:48.390]  What do you think about this, Gavin?
[19:48.650 --> 19:52.290]  A load of shit. A load of old bollocks. What have you got this week, Geoff?
[19:56.510 --> 20:01.050]  That's it? What do you think is not true about that story?
[20:01.230 --> 20:05.730]  I just think no. I've just listened to it, and I just... N-O.
[20:05.990 --> 20:12.070]  Okay. Alright, let's talk about this a little bit, Gav. You and I, now, let's reach back into our minds.
[20:12.070 --> 20:17.230]  We were both... we've been good friends with Andrew for a long time. We've been good friends for much longer.
[20:17.770 --> 20:23.470]  I'm trying to search backwards to try to think of the first times I remember Andrew.
[20:23.630 --> 20:31.790]  I definitely remember talking to Andrew about Left 4 Dead or soliciting his help during the 10,000 Gamerscore Challenge.
[20:32.010 --> 20:34.390]  And I think there might even be a video to that effect.
[20:35.010 --> 20:38.630]  I also... but I remember him, I think, just from Grifball.
[20:38.630 --> 20:44.870]  Like, I don't know that I remember him before being... there was a time when he was the best Grifball player in the world, and he was on Bernie's team.
[20:45.850 --> 20:48.490]  And he was too nice to hate. I remember that.
[20:48.830 --> 20:55.990]  Yeah. There was a brief period where I was the best on the entire planet at Grifball, but that's probably because, like, 16 people were playing it.
[20:56.130 --> 20:59.530]  And then Andrew came along and just rinsed the floor with all of us.
[20:59.690 --> 21:02.410]  You were in Austin at that time. We were living together, right?
[21:04.530 --> 21:06.830]  Uh... no, I think I was in England for Grifball, still.
[21:07.350 --> 21:09.650]  I'd been there, I just didn't think I was living there.
[21:09.890 --> 21:10.070]  Okay.
[21:10.390 --> 21:13.790]  There's some coincidences here in the story that I would like to point out.
[21:13.970 --> 21:14.410]  Yeah, go ahead.
[21:14.790 --> 21:17.310]  Andrew was the name of a family member.
[21:17.630 --> 21:21.270]  Not a... like, it's what we called them. It wasn't, I think, their birth name.
[21:21.830 --> 21:24.990]  Coincidentally, you were nicknamed An-sack.
[21:25.410 --> 21:28.790]  Yeah, well, I mean, what does sack have to do with anything?
[21:28.790 --> 21:34.410]  Did you come out of Andrew's ball sack? Is that like... oh, it's like you're, like, from Andrew's sack.
[21:34.810 --> 21:35.070]  No.
[21:35.430 --> 21:35.870]  Okay.
[21:36.770 --> 21:37.210]  No.
[21:37.450 --> 21:44.490]  Is it possible that's a secret your family has held onto for years and years and years and you're just now finding out your parents aren't your real parents?
[21:44.930 --> 21:49.690]  An-sack was a nickname given to me by one guy that I was kind of friends with in school.
[21:49.870 --> 21:54.170]  And I've considered recently trying to reach out to them and figure out... there's no way they'd remember.
[21:54.170 --> 22:00.490]  So when changing your name, your gamertag, from An-sack to I have to make something else because of the embarrassment...
[22:00.490 --> 22:00.570]  Yeah.
[22:00.650 --> 22:06.270]  Not only am I going to use the first two letters of my current gamertag, I'm not going to base it on that.
[22:06.310 --> 22:10.610]  I'm going to base it off someone else's name that just happens to be the same.
[22:10.930 --> 22:18.310]  The amount of coincidences that happened for me to meet you guys, I feel like, of all the things, that isn't an unbelievable coincidence.
[22:18.650 --> 22:22.950]  Is that coincidence how everyone met or is that just how life panned out? Is that a coincidence?
[22:22.950 --> 22:26.150]  I mean, I didn't intend to meet any of you and I did.
[22:27.990 --> 22:29.810]  That's how people meet though, isn't it?
[22:30.170 --> 22:31.330]  No, but...
[22:31.330 --> 22:35.930]  Oh, I can't wait to be 40 and meet Steven Dilbridge. I don't know who that is yet.
[22:36.410 --> 22:42.890]  And also, it sounds like you super, super intended to meet us because you wanted to play Halo with people who were involved with Halo.
[22:43.150 --> 22:50.430]  Yeah, specifically Bungie. Like the way that certain people would idolize a band as a kid, I idolized Bungie as a company.
[22:50.430 --> 22:53.670]  Yeah, sure, they made it, technically, but we made it dumb.
[22:54.050 --> 22:59.890]  Yeah, listen, I appreciated what you guys did, but it wasn't, you know, I had no real involvement.
[23:00.370 --> 23:02.630]  I hadn't thought about Red vs. Blue at that point for a while.
[23:03.010 --> 23:08.470]  I think that's a weird, like, that's a strange thing for me to, for you to be like, that's the smoking gun to you.
[23:08.770 --> 23:10.270]  That ANSAC has an AN in it.
[23:10.750 --> 23:11.710]  ANSAC's not a nickname.
[23:12.030 --> 23:17.290]  I know, it's, I don't know, I feel like it probably was like an insult in some way. I just don't know what it was.
[23:17.290 --> 23:23.990]  I wish I could get to the real meaning of the name ANSAC, like, not the bullshit one that you've come up with, but like, where did it really come from?
[23:24.050 --> 23:25.890]  Did you like Action Sack, the playlist?
[23:27.430 --> 23:28.430]  Oh, that's interesting.
[23:29.410 --> 23:31.890]  That existed before Action Sack did.
[23:32.190 --> 23:32.510]  ANSAC.
[23:32.550 --> 23:33.870]  Yeah, you're probably right there.
[23:34.170 --> 23:34.710]  Yeah, he is.
[23:34.870 --> 23:38.130]  I genuinely don't know where it came from or the meaning of it. I'd love to know.
[23:38.330 --> 23:45.710]  So if a friend from high school saw you on the street, would they say, hey Raymond, or would they say hey Andrew?
[23:46.230 --> 23:46.510]  Raymond.
[23:47.010 --> 23:48.810]  Anyone who I went to school with.
[23:49.790 --> 23:51.950]  Would they call you Ray or Raymond?
[23:52.310 --> 23:52.950]  They'd call me Ray.
[23:56.780 --> 24:01.740]  Oh, it's, uh, Eric is asking how to spell ANSAC. I believe it's A-N-S-A-C-K, yeah.
[24:02.920 --> 24:08.800]  Uh, here's, here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need a high school yearbook photo for Raymond Somer.
[24:09.180 --> 24:10.020]  I don't have any of those.
[24:11.960 --> 24:14.400]  I don't either, so I can't fault you for that.
[24:15.220 --> 24:21.080]  I can see if, if I have elementary school photos, I can see if I have those. Would my name be in those?
[24:21.500 --> 24:22.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:22.540 --> 24:24.300]  Okay, I'll see if I can find those.
[24:24.440 --> 24:30.600]  Can I get a piece of, can I just get a piece of mail addressed to Raymond Somer, like a bill?
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.360]  I could send you that, yeah.
[24:32.640 --> 24:33.900]  Did you ever win a sports trophy?
[24:34.940 --> 24:39.900]  I don't think one, I played soccer, I grew up, but I don't think it was named.
[24:40.900 --> 24:45.100]  I never played, like, to the point, it was just, like, basic, between the ages of, like, five to eight.
[24:45.280 --> 24:48.880]  So what other nicknames did you have? Like, what Ray-based nicknames?
[24:49.060 --> 24:51.060]  That was it. I didn't have any other nicknames.
[24:51.360 --> 24:55.620]  No one called you, like, Raymondo or, like, uh, they just called you ANSAC?
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.900]  Yeah, well, not, not, like, almost nobody called me ANSAC either. It was mainly just my name.
[25:01.080 --> 25:02.220]  It was just a nickname I had.
[25:02.220 --> 25:07.220]  If I needed an alias, yeah, well, that's why I pivoted, because I thought it would be weird to use.
[25:07.320 --> 25:10.940]  I was, as a kid, I didn't want to use my real name on an online thing.
[25:12.280 --> 25:15.120]  You're walking down the street, like, you're headed to McDonald's.
[25:15.520 --> 25:17.760]  How have we entertained this for so long?
[25:17.840 --> 25:23.260]  Somebody says, hey, Ray, and you turn around. And then somebody says, hey, Andrew, and you turn around?
[25:23.580 --> 25:25.360]  I don't buy it. That's too many names.
[25:25.720 --> 25:26.580]  It's two names.
[25:26.860 --> 25:29.840]  You're living two, you're not living two lives. I don't buy it.
[25:29.860 --> 25:31.340]  No, it's, it's so situational.
[25:31.940 --> 25:33.620]  It's all, it all smells terrible.
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.760]  Okay, how about this? Raymond, Ray, I'm sorry, Ray.
[25:37.040 --> 25:37.400]  How about this Ray?
[25:37.400 --> 25:38.240]  You can call me whatever you want.
[25:38.680 --> 25:39.600]  How about this Ray?
[25:40.140 --> 25:47.660]  Why does that Raymond Someracount follow one person, fucking, or have one person following him, and it's Mark Duplass?
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Okay, so that was, like, he did...
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.140]  Yeah, he's got one person following him, and he's following his fucking famous movie director, Mark Duplass.
[25:55.400 --> 25:57.420]  Wait, how do you mean he has one person following him?
[25:57.600 --> 25:58.720]  It was before...
[25:58.720 --> 25:59.140]  Oh, okay.
[25:59.280 --> 25:59.940]  Before it was public.
[25:59.940 --> 26:12.060]  He did a charity thing. I was a big fan of his work, and he did, like, a charity thing, and I changed, I had that account, and I thought, well, I'm not really using it, and so I participated in the charity thing, and he followed the account.
[26:12.820 --> 26:15.540]  That's it. It's not a great story, but that's, that's why that happened.
[26:15.840 --> 26:17.900]  That makes sense. That's plausible.
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.620]  I believe that you would do a charity thing, and I definitely believe that if Mark Duplass was involved, you'd do it, because you're so fucking into the Duplass brothers.
[26:26.060 --> 26:26.800]  At that time, I was.
[26:27.220 --> 26:28.840]  I just don't fucking believe you.
[26:28.840 --> 26:29.740]  That's okay.
[26:30.020 --> 26:32.040]  Did you ever at any point believe this, Geoff?
[26:32.580 --> 26:32.900]  No.
[26:33.140 --> 26:34.980]  I would understand why you wouldn't believe it.
[26:35.220 --> 26:35.540]  No.
[26:36.480 --> 26:47.140]  Did I believe him? No. Did I believe it was, and do I believe it's possible, and that he is the kind of person that's capable of doing it? Yes.
[26:47.140 --> 27:01.200]  I also think that Andrew or Raymond or whoever is probably possessed of a regret now in this moment, realizing that this is absolutely something that he could have and would have done if he could turn the time, like get a time machine and go back and actually do this.
[27:01.260 --> 27:01.840]  I think he would.
[27:02.080 --> 27:05.980]  I think his only real regret here is that he didn't have this idea early enough to make it real.
[27:06.380 --> 27:08.620]  What do, uh, what does Eric think about this?
[27:08.820 --> 27:12.540]  I want it to be real so badly, but I do not think it is.
[27:12.540 --> 27:19.000]  Uh, I cannot believe that you did a whole episode where you were supposed to talk about this and you didn't. That's really how I feel about it.
[27:20.280 --> 27:21.200]  That's the main worry.
[27:22.340 --> 27:23.340]  You talked about it.
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.160]  Maybe we should put these episodes out back to back, like have this one be an extra or something.
[27:27.300 --> 27:30.840]  Oh, because the last one was delayed, so we'll put two out this time?
[27:30.960 --> 27:32.460]  What if we flip the episodes?
[27:33.020 --> 27:34.360]  Yeah, it's a, I don't like that idea.
[27:34.520 --> 27:35.420]  He doesn't like that idea.
[27:35.640 --> 27:36.800]  We couldn't put this one out first?
[27:37.100 --> 27:41.000]  We, I mean, we could put this one out first. It just makes the whole thing fucked up.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.760]  Then we f*** face everybody. Then nobody knows who's f***ed and who's faced.
[27:45.160 --> 27:45.520]  At that point.
[27:46.060 --> 27:50.840]  I think, I think narratively we gotta try to maintain the linear structure of this thing.
[27:51.380 --> 27:51.740]  But...
[27:51.740 --> 27:53.780]  Yeah, right. Yeah, otherwise it would be chaos.
[27:56.020 --> 27:57.280]  I feel like...
[27:57.280 --> 27:57.840]  Sorry, go ahead again.
[27:58.140 --> 27:59.480]  No, I was gonna change the subject. Keep going.
[27:59.780 --> 28:00.620]  No, please change the subject.
[28:01.680 --> 28:04.080]  So, the power went out for days, recently.
[28:04.300 --> 28:07.360]  You guys didn't talk about that either? What did you talk about?
[28:07.480 --> 28:09.060]  No, we did, we did. I just didn't talk about this.
[28:09.060 --> 28:11.960]  We told you I hurt myself. It was an owie.
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.000]  Yeah, Geoff got a bad owie. Oh, did you graffiti the pillar yet, Geoff?
[28:16.120 --> 28:20.500]  I haven't graffitied the pillar yet, I forgot. What am I supposed to graffiti it with again?
[28:20.720 --> 28:22.920]  Geoff was here 2021, hashtag f***face.
[28:23.280 --> 28:26.040]  Okay. Yeah, I'll definitely do that.
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.020]  But because the power was off, I was trying to keep myself occupied here and there, playing some board games.
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.680]  Picked up my Switch, which I left in the dock, so that was fully charged.
[28:33.860 --> 28:36.760]  And I thought to myself, I've already told Geoff and Andrew this.
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.420]  I thought, I'll load up Stardew Valley, a game I haven't played for several years.
[28:41.820 --> 28:44.540]  I think I put it down in 2017. Are you aware of this game, Eric?
[28:45.060 --> 28:46.100]  Stardew Valley? Yes, I am.
[28:46.260 --> 28:50.500]  Yeah, so I loaded it up, found myself in year four on the farm.
[28:50.780 --> 28:52.620]  So I was like, oh yeah, I've made some good progress on this farm.
[28:52.680 --> 28:54.700]  There's a new update, so I thought I'll just continue where I am.
[28:55.220 --> 28:59.680]  I load up the game, and it displays my name, and the name of my farm.
[29:00.160 --> 29:03.100]  The name of my farm, Eric. F***face Farm.
[29:03.360 --> 29:03.680]  No.
[29:04.020 --> 29:04.700]  Can you believe it?
[29:04.860 --> 29:05.420]  Are you serious?
[29:05.420 --> 29:06.480]  I called it F***face.
[29:07.200 --> 29:07.900]  That's crazy.
[29:08.180 --> 29:09.680]  I don't know if I believe this.
[29:09.900 --> 29:10.440]  What do you mean?
[29:10.720 --> 29:12.080]  What are the odds?
[29:12.220 --> 29:16.560]  Yeah, do you have like a childhood photo with the name F***face?
[29:17.940 --> 29:21.740]  Is there a bill of some kind? Like an order?
[29:22.400 --> 29:25.480]  Could you show me the receipt in which you paid for the game when you got it?
[29:25.680 --> 29:27.840]  Whenever it is, that it came out on the Switch.
[29:27.880 --> 29:32.220]  I'd already played it on my PC a lot, but I loved the idea of having it on the Switch.
[29:32.220 --> 29:35.780]  So whatever day it came out on the Switch, is the day I made that farm.
[29:36.100 --> 29:39.980]  And I regret it, because I picked the water farm. It's the shittiest. There's no room on it.
[29:40.240 --> 29:42.520]  But it genuinely is called F***face Farm.
[29:42.760 --> 29:49.340]  And I just did a mission where I had to give the guy that runs the saloon, or the tavern, a load of eggs.
[29:49.640 --> 29:52.180]  And then he made a bunch of eggy food that they all ate.
[29:52.300 --> 29:54.120]  And one of the people who ate the food went,
[29:54.320 --> 29:56.060]  Mmm, F***face eggs.
[29:59.640 --> 30:01.760]  I took a screenshot. It made me full of joy.
[30:01.760 --> 30:05.600]  Genuinely, absolutely 100% true, that's what I named my farm.
[30:05.840 --> 30:06.580]  That's awesome, dude.
[30:06.820 --> 30:11.920]  It just shows we've all been living this F***face life and ideology for a long time.

[31:05.250 --> 31:08.030]  Well, guess what? That's about to change thanks to Honey.
[31:08.470 --> 31:11.730]  Manually searching for coupon codes is now a thing of the past.
[31:12.070 --> 31:18.330]  That's right, thanks to Honey, the free browser extension that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best ones to fit your cart.
[31:18.330 --> 31:24.990]  Honey supports over 30,000 stores online, and I bet you've shopped at every single one of them.
[31:25.130 --> 31:27.070]  Think of all the savings you could have had.
[31:27.450 --> 31:34.430]  I mean, seriously, they range from sites that have tech and gaming products to fashion stuff, like me, you know, I'm big into the popular fashion.
[31:34.970 --> 31:36.850]  And even food delivery stuff, honestly.
[31:37.330 --> 31:41.430]  Here's how it works. So imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites, and when you go to checkout,
[31:41.810 --> 31:45.630]  the Honey button drops down, and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.
[31:45.630 --> 31:51.250]  You wait a second or two as Honey searches all across the internet for the coupons that it can find for that site,
[31:51.690 --> 31:56.310]  and if it finds a working one, it'll apply it, and then your prices will drop.
[31:56.730 --> 32:04.590]  And I'm serious, I think we bought a sofa not too long ago, and I was about to hit Purchase on it,
[32:04.930 --> 32:07.950]  and my girlfriend was like, wait, wait, wait, I have Honey on my phone, let me check.
[32:08.390 --> 32:13.910]  And we ended up getting it for, I don't want to say, like 15% off what I would have paid?
[32:13.910 --> 32:15.930]  Anyway, it was a sofa, it was a pretty significant fee.
[32:16.170 --> 32:19.650]  Anyway, enough about me, nobody cares about me and my boring sofa stories.
[32:20.130 --> 32:24.370]  Honey has found its over 17 million members, over $2 billion in savings.
[32:24.570 --> 32:29.590]  That's way more interesting than when I did or didn't buy a sofa, and on whose phone it was on.
[32:30.010 --> 32:34.850]  So, if you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up missing out on free savings.

[32:48.970 --> 32:56.930]  Does it make sense that the same company who controls half of online retail also passively eavesdrops on your private conversations at home?
[32:57.310 --> 33:05.390]  You know the ones I'm talking about, the thimble-related conversations, the decorative spoon-related conversations.
[33:06.110 --> 33:14.310]  What about the idea that a single company controls 90% of internet searches, runs your email service, gets to track everything you do on your smartphone?
[33:14.730 --> 33:21.430]  Big tech is more powerful than most countries are, and they profit by exploiting your personal data.
[33:21.530 --> 33:27.050]  It's time to put a layer of protection between your online activity and these tech juggernauts.
[33:27.290 --> 33:29.270]  That's why I use ExpressVPN.
[33:29.750 --> 33:33.430]  Think about how much of your life is on the internet, browsing those thimble forums.
[33:33.430 --> 33:41.870]  Sadly, every site you visit, video you watch, or message you send to another spoon enthusiast gets tracked and data-mined.
[33:42.290 --> 33:43.290]  That's how they get you.
[33:43.690 --> 33:50.830]  But when you run ExpressVPN on your device, the software hides your IP address, something big tech can use to personally identify you.
[33:51.150 --> 33:55.450]  So ExpressVPN makes your activity harder to trace and sell to advertisers.
[33:56.130 --> 34:02.310]  ExpressVPN also encrypts 100% of your internet data to keep you safe from hackers and eavesdroppers on your network.
[34:02.310 --> 34:06.930]  Listen, your data is too important to hand over to big tech. Don't do it.
[34:07.210 --> 34:17.330]  Take all your spoon and thimble-related searches and musings and shipping-related content that maybe you've created and protect it with ExpressVPN, damn it.
[34:17.650 --> 34:22.410]  Go to expressvpn.com slash face. That's expressvpn.com slash face.

[34:35.750 --> 34:38.850]  Did I mention I got an email about the port-a-potty today?
[34:39.050 --> 34:39.730]  Did you really?
[34:40.070 --> 34:43.950]  Yeah. It's on its way. It's shipping. It's headed to you.
[34:44.190 --> 34:50.130]  Hey Eric, I don't know if you heard about this, but apparently Andrew did buy me a port-a-potty and it's pink and it's big.
[34:50.310 --> 34:58.090]  And he's delivering it to my house and I need you to arrange to have it picked up and taken to Rooster Teeth.
[34:58.090 --> 35:01.650]  Yeah, I'm busy that day, so we're gonna have to figure out something else.
[35:01.790 --> 35:05.730]  I don't need you to pick it up. I just need you to work with facilities to have it picked up.
[35:05.730 --> 35:11.570]  Yeah, and I'm busy doing that also. It seems like he's helping you out is my understanding.
[35:11.790 --> 35:14.050]  The way that he's pitched this to me is that he's helping.
[35:14.310 --> 35:14.750]  I am.
[35:14.910 --> 35:16.650]  I don't need that kind of help.
[35:16.870 --> 35:17.130]  Oh.
[35:17.430 --> 35:21.030]  Yeah, and I don't want it. I have all my bathrooms now.
[35:21.290 --> 35:22.490]  You have all your bathrooms fixed?
[35:22.690 --> 35:24.990]  Where have you been, man? My bathroom's been fixed for a while.
[35:24.990 --> 35:32.010]  I don't know if you know this, but you weren't here and we took a bunch of time off and then I missed one episode.
[35:32.710 --> 35:33.010]  So...
[35:33.010 --> 35:37.870]  Okay, well at some point in there, before the snow storm, my pipes got fixed.
[35:38.250 --> 35:40.830]  Oh, there you go. According to Nick, I talked about it on the episode you were on.
[35:40.830 --> 35:41.810]  Yeah, you mentioned it.
[35:41.930 --> 35:46.930]  But once again, the recording before that recording, you said it would take months for that toilet to be fixed.
[35:47.070 --> 35:50.810]  You know what's funny? It did take months. It took almost two months.
[35:50.810 --> 35:58.690]  I don't think I mentioned this part, but I took a sample of the paint color because they had to drywall my bathroom and stuff.
[35:59.030 --> 36:01.310]  And then they wouldn't put the toilet back in until they drywalled it.
[36:01.470 --> 36:04.470]  And then they wouldn't put the toilet in until they painted it after that.
[36:04.750 --> 36:05.270]  So it was a whole thing.
[36:05.370 --> 36:08.910]  But anyway, I had to go get paint and I took the sample in and I got the paint for the walls.
[36:09.170 --> 36:14.870]  And then the guy came and painted the walls and I came in and my white bathroom is now like doo-doo yellow.
[36:15.230 --> 36:16.250]  Like old lady yellow.
[36:16.490 --> 36:17.610]  What do you mean you took a sample?
[36:17.610 --> 36:20.810]  I had like a piece of drywall with paint on it and you can take it and you give it to them.
[36:20.870 --> 36:22.510]  And then they like read it with like the little scanner.
[36:22.770 --> 36:23.910]  And then it's like the paint.
[36:24.250 --> 36:25.850]  What? That's blowing my mind.
[36:26.150 --> 36:27.230]  It's been that way for many years.
[36:28.110 --> 36:34.430]  Yes. I think everywhere I've ever lived, I've left the walls, whatever color they were already.
[36:34.930 --> 36:38.570]  Yeah. Home Depot and Lowe's figured that out in the, I want to say the 90s, maybe.
[36:38.930 --> 36:39.730]  Maybe the early 2000s.
[36:40.270 --> 36:44.510]  I mean, I could kind of see it happening with wet paint, but with dried paint, how do they do it?
[36:44.690 --> 36:46.870]  You got to take into account the dry shift.
[36:46.870 --> 36:51.970]  Anyway, for some reason, it was supposed to be something white, like cabin white or some shit.
[36:52.130 --> 36:54.610]  And it turned out to be like old lady yellow.
[36:54.890 --> 36:59.290]  And so now Millie and Emily and I, every time we walk into the bathroom, we're disgusted by it.
[36:59.490 --> 37:00.430]  Why didn't you just repaint it?
[37:00.890 --> 37:05.050]  Because I had already paid 400 bucks to get it painted. I'm going to live with it.
[37:05.250 --> 37:07.690]  No, it's not your fault that they painted it the wrong color.
[37:07.910 --> 37:10.250]  And they painted it the color that the guy gave them.
[37:10.450 --> 37:15.610]  If it's anybody's fault, it's the guy at Lowe's who fucking messed the mix up, I guess.
[37:15.610 --> 37:20.130]  That's how it sounds in this story. It's everyone else's fault. That's what's going on.
[37:20.910 --> 37:24.570]  Look, I took a piece of white and I said, I want this white. And the guy said, no problem.
[37:24.790 --> 37:27.050]  And then the guy came and painted it and it was yellow.
[37:27.350 --> 37:33.390]  So wait, wait, he painted the new drywall and it doesn't match the rest of the room? Or he painted the whole room?
[37:33.730 --> 37:37.290]  He painted it and it didn't match. He said the shades are looking a little off.
[37:37.490 --> 37:41.270]  Do you want me just to paint the whole room? Because there was a bunch of scuffs and stuff in the room from others.
[37:41.810 --> 37:42.130]  Listen.
[37:42.290 --> 37:43.250]  So it's your fault.
[37:43.390 --> 37:44.150]  How was it my fault?
[37:44.150 --> 37:45.210]  Well, you should have checked.
[37:45.450 --> 37:46.910]  Because you told him to paint the whole room.
[37:47.150 --> 37:52.330]  Well, I just said make it all match. And he said, okay. It looked white when he did it. It dried yellow.
[37:53.530 --> 37:58.410]  Look, dude, I don't know what to say. All I'm saying is my bathroom's done. It's just ugly.
[37:58.990 --> 38:00.930]  Well, now you don't need to worry about it. You got an alternative.
[38:01.250 --> 38:01.950]  I love painting.
[38:02.290 --> 38:06.110]  I'm going to get it painted again when you come over and do it.
[38:06.210 --> 38:07.650]  I'll come over and paint your bathroom.
[38:07.810 --> 38:08.210]  Thank you, sir.
[38:08.210 --> 38:10.590]  But you have to sign the 300 cards.
[38:11.670 --> 38:15.590]  By the way, merch came looking for those and I sent them to you. I hope you've signed them.
[38:15.910 --> 38:20.130]  Yeah, remember when it snowed and you left them on the floor outside my house?
[38:20.470 --> 38:23.290]  I left them outside your house like days and days before that.
[38:23.390 --> 38:23.630]  Yeah.
[38:24.410 --> 38:25.730]  So whose fault is that?
[38:25.810 --> 38:28.130]  Wait, did you just leave them on your front porch forever?
[38:28.630 --> 38:30.350]  No, I took them in. I just was trying to scare you.
[38:30.530 --> 38:35.310]  I was about to say, I sent you a video. Remember I shit the apple out of my butt for you?
[38:35.750 --> 38:36.410]  You did.
[38:36.890 --> 38:38.010]  I still haven't signed them though.
[38:38.010 --> 38:43.370]  My favorite thing to do is drop stuff off at Gavin's house so that then I can make lewd gestures on his ring cam.
[38:44.810 --> 38:49.230]  It's always a joy. I always send him the clips afterwards just so he knows his work.
[38:49.850 --> 38:53.410]  I don't know if I ended up winning this card signing thing.
[38:53.690 --> 38:58.570]  Because I still have to mail it back. And it's almost more of an annoyance that it's only one.
[38:58.930 --> 39:00.030]  What name did you sign?
[39:00.370 --> 39:04.090]  I haven't got it yet. I got an email about it today. It's supposed to arrive later.
[39:04.430 --> 39:04.790]  We'll see.
[39:04.790 --> 39:08.570]  What I really hope for? Honestly, I'm going to buy one of the vats and I hope I get the card.
[39:08.790 --> 39:10.790]  I hope I get the 101. That'd make me very happy.
[39:11.250 --> 39:14.690]  I can't believe you expect us to believe your name is Raymond Somer.
[39:15.010 --> 39:19.270]  You can believe whatever you want to. I mean, there's no reason for you to not believe it.
[39:19.570 --> 39:23.910]  I'm telling you what the story is. I've answered your questions.
[39:24.250 --> 39:26.910]  Andrew, do you believe that we believe you?
[39:27.090 --> 39:29.550]  No, absolutely not. It's a ridiculous thing.
[39:29.550 --> 39:39.930]  But I guess if I had to equate it to something, imagine like that 4th of July party chair that I was just stuck in and that was my life and I didn't do anything about it until everyone was gone.
[39:40.270 --> 39:44.410]  It's that just extended over years. It's the same concept.
[39:44.710 --> 39:46.190]  I do believe that's possible.
[39:46.570 --> 39:56.490]  What's crazy about that chair story is that you've known us all so long at the point you were sat in that chair that I can't believe you didn't just say, I sat in this chair and it's like cracked in half.
[39:56.490 --> 40:00.510]  Well, how do you... how do I pivot to that conversationally?
[40:00.830 --> 40:04.410]  It's not like a naturally... what do I say? How do I bring that up?
[40:04.550 --> 40:06.690]  How do you bring up anything ever? What do you mean?
[40:06.950 --> 40:11.530]  Well, it's just sort of a strange thing to be like, yeah, the chair I'm sitting in right now, I think it's broken. Can't move.
[40:11.770 --> 40:16.130]  I think I would... I don't think it's strange at all. I think I would mention it immediately.
[40:17.290 --> 40:22.230]  I don't know. It just seemed like an odd thing to bring up. And I also wasn't really talking to anybody for that.
[40:22.230 --> 40:33.610]  It was brief, like, hey, how's it going? Have a good time. Like, those were the type of talks I was having. It'd be weird. It wasn't extended dialogue. Hey, how's it going? Enjoy the party. This chair's broken. Can't leave. Bye.
[40:34.290 --> 40:34.870]  Like, what?
[40:35.610 --> 40:37.110]  I spoke to a bunch that day.
[40:37.390 --> 40:38.710]  No, definitely not.
[40:38.890 --> 40:39.490]  You haven't laughed.
[40:39.790 --> 40:43.110]  No, I feel like 30 seconds in, 30 seconds out.
[40:43.330 --> 40:48.730]  No, a load of bollocks. Because at one point you were in the living room. You were the only one in the living room. So I came over and I said hi to you there.
[40:48.930 --> 40:50.150]  I don't remember that at all.
[40:50.150 --> 40:50.390]  Okay.
[40:50.390 --> 40:57.190]  Yeah, okay. That's not me. I just meant within the chair. Within the chair, I talked to essentially nobody.
[40:57.210 --> 41:01.750]  That was much later in the day, so I feel like most of our conversation was had, maybe, at that point.
[41:01.930 --> 41:12.330]  It's possible. But it's the same idea. If I get stuck in a thing, I would just ride it out for as long as I could. I didn't plan on bringing up the Raymond Somer thing, but a fucking snowstorm happened.
[41:12.530 --> 41:13.390]  You just had to, right?
[41:13.390 --> 41:31.610]  Yeah, I looked at it. I thought, okay, I have a time in which I have to do this. I'm the only one who can record for this. What is something I could bring up that's content, that can be brief, and is something so people get, maybe not a full episode, but they get something at least.
[41:31.970 --> 41:34.490]  And I thought, well, I guess this is a time in which I could do this.
[41:36.090 --> 41:48.350]  So if I were to... if someone that you've known for a long time were to send you monogrammed towels for Christmas, what would the initials probably be?
[41:48.690 --> 41:59.030]  Well, if I was sending them to you, it would be Andrew Pan. It would be AP, because that is the name, the alias, that I was going under. Everything that I'd send to you as a gift would be under the name that you know me as.
[41:59.150 --> 42:03.110]  What if, like, are you saying somebody who isn't outside of...
[42:03.110 --> 42:16.010]  Are... do you mean to tell... does your mother know... are you... see, no, I don't want to approach this like it's fucking true. Are you insinuating... are you trying to tell me that your mother knows that you go by the alias Andrew Pan and she's familiar with this?
[42:16.210 --> 42:16.470]  Yes.
[42:16.770 --> 42:27.030]  So the people in your life that are... people in your physical, personal, Vancouver Island life, who are different from your video game career, podcasting life...
[42:27.030 --> 42:27.430]  Yes.
[42:27.430 --> 42:36.290]  To them, you are and always will be Raymond Somer, and they understand that the rest of the larger world thinks that you are someone named Andrew Pan.
[42:36.410 --> 42:47.730]  So let me talk about... address something. In the very first episode of this show, we had a conversation and we joked about naming this podcast... I don't remember if it was Andrew Pan or if it was just Andrew.
[42:48.010 --> 42:49.570]  I wanted to name it Andrew, yeah.
[42:49.570 --> 43:02.630]  Okay. Well, I talked about that and I told a story about how I told my mom that that's what we're going to call the show and that I said I would have to change my name later as a joke because that's what the thing was called.
[43:02.910 --> 43:03.390]  I remember that.
[43:03.530 --> 43:18.310]  And it made her cry. Yeah. That wasn't... that didn't happen that way. That was something that happened in reverse of that, where I told her once, should I just legally change my name to Andrew Pan? And she did not like that idea at all. She was not a fan.
[43:18.310 --> 43:23.690]  So I took that story and I incorporated it into the show thing just for content within the show.
[43:25.130 --> 43:25.650]  Here's...
[43:27.790 --> 43:31.750]  These moments of thought that I'm left with after he stops talking.
[43:32.090 --> 43:33.930]  It's so frustrating.
[43:34.430 --> 43:38.970]  I'm 100% sure he's full of shit, but there's just that little glint of like...
[43:38.970 --> 43:39.690]  I know, dude.
[43:39.710 --> 43:40.770]  But what if, though?
[43:41.210 --> 43:46.850]  It's like a splinter in my thumb of, oh, it's aggravating and it's not...
[43:47.330 --> 43:57.170]  So when you came to visit Achievement Hunter, we worked with someone who was called Ray. Did he walk up to you and say, hey, what's up, Ray? Nice to meet you. And you went, hey, I'm Andrew.
[43:57.530 --> 43:59.550]  Are you calling me Ray or are you Ray?
[43:59.870 --> 44:02.530]  I don't understand why this is fucking confusing to you guys.
[44:02.530 --> 44:07.270]  Because if a guy called Ray meets another guy called Ray, then surely you have like a little Ray bonding moment.
[44:07.430 --> 44:14.350]  Not when you're going under an alias of Andrew Pan. It's not what I'm known as in this group. It's like a stage name, essentially.
[44:14.950 --> 44:16.830]  So, no, I would never acknowledge it.
[44:16.990 --> 44:19.350]  I just, I don't want to believe the fucking conversation.
[44:20.290 --> 44:29.110]  Could you imagine if I did in that context? And then that's how, like, how do I, how would he be the only one that knew? That'd be weird.
[44:30.570 --> 44:38.870]  Here's the frustrating thing, Gavin. I buy the mom's story and I buy that he told it backwards. I've done, I can see that.
[44:39.770 --> 44:42.470]  I think he's hunting for stuff that he can pivot.
[44:42.470 --> 44:48.750]  I know, I know, but that part, as someone who has legally changed their name in the past and had that conversation with his mom,
[44:49.090 --> 44:57.030]  I gotta admit that it just, maybe I'm just, maybe I'm putting my, maybe I'm looking for a reason to believe it.
[44:57.110 --> 45:00.510]  But it felt authentic to me based on my previous experiences.
[45:00.610 --> 45:03.330]  But maybe it's just me bleeding, putting my feelings on it.
[45:03.810 --> 45:07.710]  Um, I don't wanna, it's fucking annoying.
[45:08.170 --> 45:10.550]  I'm gonna have to think about this for the rest of my goddamn life.
[45:10.550 --> 45:12.430]  I'm not gonna think about it ever again after this.
[45:12.630 --> 45:16.330]  I have to scrub at the moment. I have to get it out of my brain.
[45:16.430 --> 45:19.150]  It's, this is garbage. I'm storing all this shite.
[45:19.610 --> 45:21.410]  It's, what a load of bollocks, Andrew.
[45:21.810 --> 45:28.170]  Okay, but let's just say, I understand your position, but think about it in a different context.
[45:28.770 --> 45:33.610]  If this is true, how do you now feel about everything that you, your position on this?
[45:33.750 --> 45:35.270]  That's a question, Gavin.
[45:35.590 --> 45:37.150]  I would love to know the answer to that too.
[45:37.570 --> 45:40.330]  Assuming it was true, like, let's suspend disbelief for a second.
[45:40.710 --> 45:41.350]  You might not need to.
[45:41.450 --> 45:44.730]  Does this change anything for you? How do you feel about this person?
[45:45.150 --> 45:49.130]  Uh, if it was true, it wouldn't change anything.
[45:49.330 --> 45:52.090]  Someone's name is like the least important thing about them.
[45:52.250 --> 45:53.250]  Yeah, I didn't even mean that.
[45:53.550 --> 45:57.710]  I'm saying you're very aggressively like, this is bollocks, you're full of shit.
[45:58.050 --> 46:01.370]  If it's true, how do you feel about that?
[46:01.570 --> 46:02.790]  How do you feel about these clips?
[46:03.090 --> 46:04.490]  I'd be very wrong, I guess.
[46:04.670 --> 46:04.850]  Yeah.
[46:04.850 --> 46:05.630]  I'd stick by it.
[46:05.730 --> 46:09.550]  These extra words you're spewing aren't making me...
[46:09.550 --> 46:12.310]  You're trying to change my percentage of how much I believe you.
[46:12.450 --> 46:12.930]  I'm not.
[46:12.990 --> 46:14.410]  I'm not trying to change anything.
[46:14.610 --> 46:18.330]  I'm just addressing the fact that your most compelling evidence against that you stated
[46:18.330 --> 46:23.110]  is that Andrew Panton and Ansac both share two letters.
[46:23.510 --> 46:24.010]  But I don't...
[46:24.550 --> 46:28.190]  It's not on me to find evidence of your name not being...
[46:28.910 --> 46:30.210]  You're asking a lot of us.
[46:30.410 --> 46:30.890]  No, I'm not.
[46:30.950 --> 46:33.970]  I'm just saying that's the thing that you've said is the biggest hurdle for you.
[46:33.970 --> 46:36.710]  That was your smoking gun and it's an absurd statement.
[46:37.050 --> 46:38.330]  I've never seen his passport.
[46:38.550 --> 46:38.950]  I don't...
[46:38.950 --> 46:41.710]  I mean, he sounds just American to me.
[46:41.970 --> 46:42.750]  I could send you a photo.
[46:43.030 --> 46:44.550]  What if you don't live in Canada?
[46:45.110 --> 46:45.930]  That's a great point.
[46:46.270 --> 46:47.750]  Gavin, what if he lives in Austin?
[46:48.110 --> 46:49.170]  What if he's in like Round Rock?
[46:50.290 --> 46:52.590]  What if he's been like four miles away the whole time?
[46:52.950 --> 46:56.210]  Every time we fly him to Austin, he has to fly to Canada first.
[46:56.450 --> 46:56.810]  Yeah.
[46:57.450 --> 46:59.310]  That's why the journeys are so long.
[46:59.490 --> 47:02.290]  He's like, oh, I gotta take a ferry and then fly off a different island.
[47:02.290 --> 47:06.290]  No, he's just on the way to Canada so he can fly from Canada back to Austin.
[47:06.630 --> 47:07.950]  Now that makes sense.
[47:09.390 --> 47:13.750]  This is such a different episode in comparison to the one that just came out.
[47:13.890 --> 47:16.030]  I am gonna... you're totally right.
[47:16.350 --> 47:21.570]  And I'm so glad we didn't do these last two episodes back to back because I would go from this...
[47:21.570 --> 47:24.750]  As it is, we're gonna stop recording at four o'clock.
[47:25.350 --> 47:26.830]  I'm gonna go to bed.
[47:27.290 --> 47:29.650]  I'm physically and emotionally drained from this.
[47:29.750 --> 47:31.650]  I can't imagine if we had done them back to back.
[47:31.650 --> 47:33.350]  I'd have to go straight to the hospital.
[47:34.210 --> 47:37.570]  You'd have to admit me into a facility for exhaustion.
[47:39.010 --> 47:40.050]  That seems extreme.
[47:40.410 --> 47:44.070]  Andrew, how would you feel if one of us revealed that we were actually called something else?
[47:44.250 --> 47:44.750]  I wouldn't care.
[47:45.030 --> 47:46.990]  I mean, we don't care either.
[47:47.210 --> 47:51.650]  But what would it mean to you if we'd known you this long and never told you our real name?
[47:51.830 --> 47:54.210]  Okay, well, I think I'm a bad person to ask.
[47:54.270 --> 47:56.990]  I think I talked about it on the show before.
[47:56.990 --> 48:02.410]  There's a time a power line exploded outside of my house and fire was shooting out of it.
[48:02.510 --> 48:03.370]  And there are trees nearby.
[48:03.750 --> 48:05.130]  And I looked at it for a second.
[48:05.250 --> 48:06.390]  I thought, oh, that's no good.
[48:06.730 --> 48:08.310]  I just went back to watching TV.
[48:08.550 --> 48:10.730]  I'd be completely unfazed by this reveal.
[48:10.910 --> 48:11.570]  It would mean nothing.
[48:11.750 --> 48:13.010]  I'd just carry about my day.
[48:13.350 --> 48:13.910]  Like, oh, okay.
[48:14.190 --> 48:14.910]  That's all you'd get.
[48:16.170 --> 48:17.890]  I don't think we ever talk about this again either.
[48:18.230 --> 48:19.110]  I said my story.
[48:19.110 --> 48:19.510]  No, we shouldn't.
[48:19.630 --> 48:22.290]  We spent the last episode not talking about this enough.
[48:22.490 --> 48:26.090]  And this episode, talking about it for way too long.
[48:26.090 --> 48:27.950]  Okay, here's what I propose.
[48:28.130 --> 48:31.570]  Do you remember the movie Beer Fest?
[48:31.970 --> 48:32.290]  No.
[48:32.690 --> 48:34.170]  Well, I'm aware it exists.
[48:34.410 --> 48:35.490]  Gavin, have you seen it?
[48:35.530 --> 48:35.990]  Do you remember it?
[48:36.150 --> 48:36.830]  Did you show it to me?
[48:37.050 --> 48:37.630]  Probably, yeah.
[48:37.690 --> 48:39.630]  I think we watched it in a hotel together with Bernie and Matt.
[48:40.670 --> 48:46.190]  In that movie, the guy that plays Farva, kind of the bigger guy, he's also in Sky High.
[48:46.270 --> 48:46.690]  He's really funny.
[48:46.790 --> 48:48.890]  Anyway, he plays a character who dies.
[48:49.410 --> 48:53.910]  And then they replace him with his twin brother who looks exactly like him.
[48:53.910 --> 49:01.230]  And then he says, in my brother's honor, why don't you guys just refer to me as his name for the whole movie.
[49:01.470 --> 49:04.590]  So basically, the character dies and they replace him with him again.
[49:04.730 --> 49:05.430]  And it's the same dude.
[49:05.830 --> 49:11.130]  Maybe we should kill Raymond Somer and replace him with Andrew Panton and just move on with our lives.
[49:12.150 --> 49:12.170]  What?
[49:13.590 --> 49:15.450]  I zoned... I'm gonna be honest.
[49:15.590 --> 49:17.450]  I zoned out and I came back into death.
[49:17.450 --> 49:18.090]  Oh, for God's sake.
[49:18.550 --> 49:24.370]  I like that you tell this 25 minute elaborate story of a lot of bollocks about your name being the wrong thing.
[49:24.510 --> 49:27.750]  And then we try to tell you a 10 second story and you shoot out.
[49:27.990 --> 49:32.290]  Well, what happened was I started thinking about Super Troopers and if I like that movie.
[49:32.370 --> 49:36.390]  I don't think I do. People seem to really like Super Troopers. It's okay. It's a great movie.
[49:36.570 --> 49:38.670]  Brian Cox bite in the soap. That's a great moment.
[49:38.870 --> 49:42.930]  Getting hit in the head with a fucking maple syrup at this diner at the beginning is phenomenal.
[49:43.210 --> 49:44.810]  And when he throws up, it's real.
[49:45.070 --> 49:46.410]  Yeah. Is Super Troopers good?
[49:46.410 --> 49:50.310]  Yes. Super Troopers 2, I don't remember as well, but one is a classic.
[49:50.590 --> 49:50.850]  Okay.
[49:51.070 --> 49:56.270]  Man, I wrote down so much for this episode. I didn't... there was no chance of ever getting into it.
[49:56.390 --> 49:57.430]  What do you got? What do you got?
[49:57.670 --> 50:00.030]  Listen, before we go, let's do one thing.
[50:00.210 --> 50:00.650]  We're an hour.
[50:00.870 --> 50:02.010]  One thing. One quick thing.
[50:02.130 --> 50:02.510]  One thing.
[50:02.610 --> 50:06.470]  We can't... it's been such a downer listening to Andrew lie to us like this. We got to have something fun.
[50:06.570 --> 50:11.150]  I didn't lie. As I said, if it was a bit, I'd pretend it wasn't a bit. It's not a bit.
[50:11.150 --> 50:19.450]  You know, when you're growing up and you go to school and it's like the first time you're mixing with other humans and you sort of learn the boundaries of other humans and how they work.
[50:19.690 --> 50:26.030]  I needed to have grown up with someone like Andrew because I'm 32 years old and I have no idea how to handle this.
[50:26.230 --> 50:26.370]  Yeah.
[50:26.610 --> 50:34.570]  I mean, funny enough, at one point in this show, Gavin, you said, I am the person that you've known the longest and know the least about. And that was a very funny moment for me.
[50:38.050 --> 50:44.750]  Yeah, I've known you for so many years, yet most of my thoughts about you are my own imagination.
[50:45.150 --> 50:50.170]  Like I just imagine what you're doing or like what your life is like because I have no freaking idea.
[50:50.410 --> 50:50.710]  Yeah.
[50:51.270 --> 50:57.570]  It's weird that we've known all known each other for as long as we have and have spent in person very little time together.
[50:57.830 --> 51:02.150]  We have still yet to record an episode of F***face in person.
[51:02.330 --> 51:04.230]  I wonder when that will be, if ever.
[51:04.230 --> 51:05.110]  I don't know.
[51:05.430 --> 51:06.090]  That's a good question.
[51:06.370 --> 51:11.590]  I bet that would be a really weird episode. And I don't mean like chaotic weird, like crazy.
[51:11.790 --> 51:13.470]  I think it would just be awkward.
[51:13.830 --> 51:19.710]  Super, not awkward, but way toned down because we're not used to looking at each other while we do this.
[51:19.830 --> 51:26.170]  It's funny because we were talking about before, you know, before the pandemic, Rooster Teeth, we produced content differently.
[51:26.290 --> 51:28.590]  And then because of the pandemic, we had to start doing stuff like this.
[51:28.590 --> 51:32.930]  We wouldn't have normally done an audio only remote podcast.
[51:33.350 --> 51:37.010]  That's just not the way we, from a quality standpoint, we wanted to approach things.
[51:37.110 --> 51:39.630]  And then we figured out a way to get it done and get it.
[51:39.630 --> 51:42.110]  It turns out we can do it very high quality and do it very well.
[51:42.430 --> 51:43.750]  And now the opposite is true.
[51:43.830 --> 51:46.830]  I can't imagine ever doing a podcast with you two in person.
[51:47.090 --> 51:48.830]  Well, you and I have done loads in person.
[51:49.090 --> 51:50.990]  Yeah, I'll do it if we have to.
[51:52.770 --> 51:55.370]  I really appreciate the safety of this screen.
[51:55.730 --> 51:58.390]  And I really appreciate as much as I love you two.
[51:58.730 --> 52:04.830]  When I stop and I upload that video and then I take my headphones off, I get like, I appreciate that you're not in the room with me for a couple minutes.
[52:05.230 --> 52:11.230]  I think that you would struggle a lot more to loudly eat a salad and think you got away with it if we were in person.
[52:14.630 --> 52:15.230]  That's fair.
[52:15.550 --> 52:16.910]  So, Gav, what were you going to talk about?
[52:16.910 --> 52:22.450]  We don't have to talk about it, but let's give the audience a tease about what you want to bring to the table next week.
[52:22.610 --> 52:24.650]  We're in season two. I forgot about that whole bit.
[52:24.750 --> 52:26.910]  Yeah, what can we expect from season two?
[52:27.270 --> 52:30.870]  I bought a coat once and they forgot to take the security tag out.
[52:31.090 --> 52:32.890]  And then I just decided to leave it in.
[52:33.230 --> 52:39.190]  And I set off between 400 and 500 alarms in stores.
[52:41.210 --> 52:41.610]  Okay.
[52:42.110 --> 52:42.770]  That's a teaser.
[52:43.110 --> 52:45.090]  Is that the whole story or is there more to it?
[52:45.090 --> 52:49.390]  Well, I mean, it was a f***ing face, really, is that I could have just cut it out when I got home.
[52:49.770 --> 52:52.950]  But instead, I'm telling it now, aren't I? Well, instead, I...
[52:52.950 --> 52:54.930]  Sonic, what are we doing? Are we ending it or what?
[52:55.130 --> 52:56.270]  How old were you?
[52:56.530 --> 53:00.250]  Yeah, we're ending it. You can just end it. You can tell people to rate and subscribe.
[53:00.690 --> 53:06.410]  Alright, well, thanks for tuning in to episode 41 of Face, episode one of season two.
[53:06.690 --> 53:12.990]  Hope you tune in for episode two of season two when you find out more about Gavin's thrilling coat.
[53:12.990 --> 53:15.770]  Wait, but we already did the first episode of series two.
[53:15.910 --> 53:16.930]  Yeah, this was the first episode.
[53:17.210 --> 53:18.290]  No, last week.
[53:18.550 --> 53:19.250]  Oh, shit.
[53:19.590 --> 53:22.210]  Because this is exactly the problem. It hasn't come out yet.
[53:22.330 --> 53:25.790]  It's the week, it's the black hole of the last episode that we've fallen into again.
[53:25.870 --> 53:29.750]  It's too late. This is titled episode one of season two. This is, that's the title.
[53:29.910 --> 53:36.570]  Okay. Hello, thanks for tuning in to f***face episode 41, also known as episode two of season two.
[53:36.750 --> 53:37.750]  Episode one of season two.
[53:37.750 --> 53:44.250]  Last week we treated you to an Eric-less and Nick-less episode. We did our best to fill in with Adam.
[53:44.370 --> 53:48.170]  We talked a lot about Gavin getting hit in the head and being paranoid that people are throwing sticks at him.
[53:48.630 --> 53:56.110]  I believe we talked about some other things as well. Episode two, you heard us conclude the Raymond Saumur saga.
[53:57.190 --> 54:03.030]  I think it probably... yeah, it took about six months off my life that I won't get back now.
[54:03.630 --> 54:06.190]  I feel diminished. I feel a little bit like...
[54:06.190 --> 54:07.850]  You know how, you know how...
[54:07.850 --> 54:09.290]  No, it's over. Nope, this is over.
[54:09.370 --> 54:14.270]  Yeah, no, no, I'm saying goodbye. I'm just gonna end it. I'm just gonna... you know how Palpatine turns wrinkly?
[54:14.710 --> 54:15.890]  I've never seen Star Wars.
[54:16.050 --> 54:16.870]  Well, I'm not talking to you then.
[54:17.010 --> 54:17.550]  From the lightning.
[54:17.770 --> 54:23.590]  Yeah, from the lightning, he turns like wrinkly and old. I feel like that kind of happened to me, my soul a little bit.
[54:23.810 --> 54:26.410]  Yeah, Andrew was Samuel L. Jackson with a purple lightsaber.
[54:26.690 --> 54:30.070]  Yeah, and my Palpatine soul is wrinkled now.
[54:30.070 --> 54:36.030]  I just hope that the rest of season two is nothing like this one. I don't even want to proof this one.
[54:36.250 --> 54:38.170]  I'll be honest. I don't want to have to listen to that again.
[54:39.790 --> 54:42.730]  Oh my God, I just bent down and hit my forehead. I almost knocked myself.
[54:43.030 --> 54:43.910]  Jesus Christ. Okay, bye!
[54:45.050 --> 54:47.170]  Ow, it's a metal bar!
[54:47.250 --> 54:47.990]  It hurts!
[54:48.450 --> 54:48.810]  Fuck!
