[00:00.460 --> 00:02.640]  This episode is brought to you by Corona.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.420]  When you're on a beach with an ice-cold Corona in hand,
[00:05.620 --> 00:06.860]  how can you not feel centered?
[00:07.080 --> 00:08.980]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[00:09.280 --> 00:12.320]  That's because whether after work, at barbecues or at a bar,
[00:12.540 --> 00:13.940]  with just a squeeze of lime,
[00:14.060 --> 00:16.160]  Corona brings you La Playa mentality.
[00:16.700 --> 00:18.480]  Because while we all want the beach life,
[00:18.800 --> 00:21.000]  paradise doesn't always have palm trees.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.440]  Corona. La Playa awaits.

[00:25.780 --> 00:26.520]  Relax responsibly.

[00:27.400 --> 00:29.040]  Imported by Crown Imports Chicago, Illinois.
[00:31.280 --> 00:33.700]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:45.340 --> 00:46.620]  Hey, I was on time, Gavin.
[00:47.100 --> 00:47.440]  Look at me.
[00:47.480 --> 00:49.020]  Yeah, it didn't matter because, uh,
[00:49.040 --> 00:50.620]  Aaron was just yakking away this time.
[00:50.980 --> 00:52.320]  Yeah, we were waiting for you, so it's fine.
[00:52.580 --> 00:53.760]  No, I was here at half three, so.
[00:54.120 --> 00:55.000]  No, I disagree.
[00:55.460 --> 00:55.800]  Fuck.
[00:56.220 --> 00:57.700]  Hello, hello, hello.
[00:58.020 --> 01:02.380]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:02.720 --> 01:04.120]  I believe it's episode 42.
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.740]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always,
[01:07.860 --> 01:09.860]  Gavin Free and Raymond Sommer.
[01:09.860 --> 01:10.940]  How's it going, boys?
[01:11.180 --> 01:12.640]  What have you been up to since...
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.420]  When did we do this last?
[01:13.580 --> 01:14.160]  Like two days ago?
[01:14.460 --> 01:15.260]  It's like a week ago.
[01:15.340 --> 01:16.580]  Can I be honest with you guys?
[01:16.840 --> 01:17.360]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:17.580 --> 01:18.780]  That sounded...
[01:19.860 --> 01:22.840]  That sounded like such a fucking podcast-y podcast intro.
[01:22.980 --> 01:23.420]  I hate it.
[01:23.480 --> 01:23.980]  Can we do it again?
[01:24.140 --> 01:25.700]  You're the host of a podcast, but yeah.
[01:25.880 --> 01:27.900]  Yeah, I don't know what you think you're doing.
[01:28.100 --> 01:28.620]  It's a podcast.
[01:31.540 --> 01:33.060]  Listen, while I was saying it,
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.860]  I was envisioning me saying...
[01:34.860 --> 01:36.620]  I looked like a person I would want to punch.
[01:37.420 --> 01:39.420]  Like, if I heard me delivering...
[01:39.420 --> 01:42.760]  I'm just like a random dude and I hear me delivering the intro to that podcast,
[01:42.900 --> 01:43.660]  I want to hit me.
[01:43.780 --> 01:47.900]  I think it's mainly because we can all hear you ramping up to that mode,
[01:48.220 --> 01:49.640]  but while you're talking.
[01:49.860 --> 01:50.620]  Because you're always like...
[01:52.160 --> 01:54.920]  Well, it's because I keep wait...
[01:54.920 --> 01:56.160]  I keep waiting to get interrupted.
[01:56.340 --> 01:56.940]  So I only...
[01:56.940 --> 01:59.320]  Like, I ramp up the further I get from being interrupted.
[01:59.760 --> 02:00.560]  The higher the...
[02:00.560 --> 02:02.520]  Like, increases the chance that I'm not going to get it.
[02:02.580 --> 02:03.760]  So yeah, I put more in.
[02:04.600 --> 02:06.080]  Anyway, this is F*** Face.
[02:06.200 --> 02:07.540]  It is episode 42.
[02:08.120 --> 02:08.980]  I am Geoff.
[02:09.240 --> 02:09.800]  You are Gavin.
[02:09.900 --> 02:10.920]  And you are Raymond.
[02:11.180 --> 02:13.080]  And I feel a lot better about that intro.
[02:13.220 --> 02:13.720]  I don't...
[02:13.720 --> 02:15.760]  If I heard that, I would be like...
[02:15.760 --> 02:17.680]  Oh, that's a guy slightly defeated doing an intro.
[02:17.880 --> 02:18.660]  And I wouldn't want to hit him.
[02:18.860 --> 02:22.260]  I guess we're making up for the episodes that had no intro by having two on this one.
[02:22.460 --> 02:23.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.340]  How many didn't have intros?
[02:24.940 --> 02:26.120]  I feel like most had intros.
[02:26.280 --> 02:26.820]  I know we went through a wave.
[02:26.820 --> 02:31.100]  We can't possibly talk about intros anymore than we already have.
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.500]  Okay, I was just asking.
[02:32.800 --> 02:33.760]  Isn't this season two?
[02:33.860 --> 02:34.820]  Aren't we on the new stuff?
[02:35.400 --> 02:35.880]  That's true.
[02:35.880 --> 02:38.240]  I mean, but you're the one doing two f***ing intros.
[02:38.320 --> 02:39.580]  What do you mean are we on the new stuff?
[02:39.640 --> 02:40.400]  You're doing the repeat.
[02:40.860 --> 02:42.600]  Oh, maybe that's what Geoff thinks season two is.
[02:42.640 --> 02:43.940]  Every episode has two episodes.
[02:44.000 --> 02:44.400]  I mean, intro...
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.320]  Oh, s***, sod it.
[02:48.460 --> 02:51.060]  F*** it, Nick says 30% don't have an intro.
[02:52.600 --> 02:54.160]  There's no way it's that high.
[02:54.340 --> 02:55.660]  I bet you it is.
[02:55.820 --> 02:57.200]  I bet there's a pretty good chance it is.
[02:57.220 --> 03:00.820]  Wait, does it count if we do it like 45 minutes in and do an intro?
[03:00.940 --> 03:01.560]  Does that count?
[03:01.740 --> 03:02.680]  Or does that not count?
[03:03.140 --> 03:03.840]  That doesn't count?
[03:03.900 --> 03:04.720]  Then what's the point of it?
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.440]  There was a run of episode 16s that I don't think had intros alone.
[03:08.520 --> 03:10.240]  That was probably 20 of those.
[03:10.320 --> 03:13.420]  I think at least 50% of episode 16s didn't have an intro.
[03:14.120 --> 03:16.940]  Do we know what the first episode 16 was?
[03:17.340 --> 03:17.680]  I keep meaning...
[03:17.680 --> 03:18.420]  Yeah, it was episode 16.
[03:18.800 --> 03:19.700]  Yeah, I know, but I mean, was it...
[03:19.700 --> 03:21.260]  It came right after episode 15.
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.440]  Wow, that's great.
[03:22.740 --> 03:23.640]  I appreciate that insight.
[03:24.120 --> 03:24.660]  I was just curious.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.340]  We did a lot of 16s.
[03:27.620 --> 03:28.420]  Episode 16?
[03:28.880 --> 03:29.800]  I don't know, man.
[03:29.800 --> 03:30.940]  That was like a million years ago.
[03:31.160 --> 03:31.520]  I know.
[03:31.720 --> 03:34.200]  I was just curious what even is on the first episode 16.
[03:34.200 --> 03:34.920]  I have no idea.
[03:35.060 --> 03:36.860]  Would that be like pencil times?
[03:37.260 --> 03:39.040]  Let me look at episode 16.
[03:39.540 --> 03:41.260]  Oh, they're not numbered.
[03:42.300 --> 03:43.440]  That's gonna make it difficult.
[03:44.160 --> 03:44.980]  That would...
[03:44.980 --> 03:46.740]  Do you want what episode 16 was?
[03:47.580 --> 03:48.840]  Wait, the new ones are numbered.
[03:50.180 --> 03:51.480]  Episode 39 is numbered.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.640]  Episode 40 is numbered.
[03:52.880 --> 03:53.920]  Nothing else is numbered.
[03:54.520 --> 03:54.820]  Why?
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.500]  A variety of lawsuits.
[03:57.100 --> 03:58.240]  Bog roll folders.
[03:58.700 --> 04:00.140]  Oh, yeah, that was probably deep in pencil.
[04:00.360 --> 04:01.180]  Then if there's lawsuits...
[04:01.180 --> 04:01.820]  That was probably pencil.
[04:01.920 --> 04:03.360]  I don't remember what the bog roll is.
[04:04.120 --> 04:04.760]  There we go.
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.780]  Geoff, Gavin, and Andrew talk about Gavin's assembled legal team,
[04:09.120 --> 04:12.720]  Geoff's first take place, Garfield finish,
[04:13.220 --> 04:14.700]  bog roll folders, and more.
[04:14.940 --> 04:16.640]  I forgot you played Garfield.
[04:16.740 --> 04:17.100]  Briefly.
[04:17.680 --> 04:18.340]  Yeah, you know what else?
[04:18.420 --> 04:21.660]  I remember when I kept calling you on the Anaheim number that I had,
[04:21.760 --> 04:22.880]  because you mentioned...
[04:22.880 --> 04:23.180]  I forgot.
[04:23.240 --> 04:24.940]  There are a lot of things I forgot that happened.
[04:25.440 --> 04:25.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:25.460 --> 04:26.840]  You kept calling me on that California number.
[04:26.920 --> 04:27.240]  That's true.
[04:27.340 --> 04:28.320]  Yeah, that's great.
[04:28.740 --> 04:31.020]  I have an issue with Eric I want to talk about immediately,
[04:31.180 --> 04:31.900]  just before we get too far.
[04:32.740 --> 04:33.940]  I'm glad that you did that.
[04:34.040 --> 04:34.540]  Hold on a second.
[04:35.000 --> 04:35.320]  Okay.
[04:35.620 --> 04:36.000]  All right.
[04:36.400 --> 04:37.120]  I had to get that out.
[04:37.820 --> 04:39.300]  I got nothing.
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.160]  I got nothing for today.
[04:41.160 --> 04:41.740]  What was that?
[04:42.240 --> 04:42.780]  I was a burp.
[04:42.940 --> 04:44.380]  I got that burp, and that was it.
[04:44.560 --> 04:45.580]  I got a burp, and that...
[04:48.740 --> 04:54.140]  I stopped at Raymond Somer and Zimmer and the acronym.
[04:54.440 --> 04:56.940]  My brain turned off after the last episode,
[04:57.100 --> 04:58.520]  and nothing has happened in my life since,
[04:58.540 --> 04:59.520]  so I got nothing to talk about.
[04:59.840 --> 05:00.140]  Okay.
[05:00.140 --> 05:04.860]  Well, I wanted to talk to Eric about the fact he gave a lot of shit
[05:04.860 --> 05:09.100]  about not doing the shake my head reveal in that episode.
[05:09.480 --> 05:10.840]  Talked a lot about it last time.
[05:11.180 --> 05:12.580]  Nobody commented on it.
[05:12.800 --> 05:14.160]  Nobody was in suspense.
[05:14.480 --> 05:17.180]  It was not a big deal, but it would have made more sense to just wait.
[05:17.500 --> 05:20.860]  I think that's only because there was a bigger thing that we hadn't talked about.
[05:21.620 --> 05:25.880]  It just seemed he put a lot of force into that.
[05:25.940 --> 05:27.320]  We were idiots for not covering that.
[05:27.480 --> 05:28.060]  Nobody cared.
[05:28.380 --> 05:29.460]  Nobody cared about that coverage.
[05:29.460 --> 05:30.560]  Lack of coverage.
[05:30.660 --> 05:32.380]  I mean, I think you nailed it, Gavin.
[05:32.540 --> 05:32.940]  I don't know.
[05:33.300 --> 05:34.180]  Like, I don't know.
[05:34.260 --> 05:36.800]  You dig a big hole, and then you dig a bigger hole next to it,
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.600]  and people go, wow, that's a really big hole.
[05:39.740 --> 05:41.020]  Oh, okay, there's a small.
[05:41.060 --> 05:43.720]  But look how big this giant hole is, so...
[05:43.720 --> 05:45.340]  Yeah, I also don't know if...
[05:45.340 --> 05:48.040]  Like, the response being that people didn't seem to care
[05:48.040 --> 05:51.500]  doesn't make it what we did any less dumb.
[05:51.720 --> 05:55.120]  It just means that either they were focused on the bigger hole,
[05:55.280 --> 05:57.780]  or they're so conditioned to disappointment
[05:57.780 --> 06:01.000]  that they just, that was, that's like, that's the bar.
[06:01.560 --> 06:04.520]  And that's a great point, you know, and which isn't a good thing either.
[06:04.840 --> 06:08.480]  Can I say, I've really been enjoying the f*** face Instagram.
[06:08.720 --> 06:13.040]  It's really my only window into how out of control this ZimmerZone thing has gone.
[06:13.440 --> 06:14.280]  It's amazing.
[06:15.140 --> 06:19.520]  So many confused people who know nothing of this podcast around the world.
[06:19.620 --> 06:20.100]  I love it.
[06:20.360 --> 06:25.880]  It might be the crowning achievement of all things we've done in Rooster Teeth,
[06:26.040 --> 06:27.140]  or at least in my career,
[06:27.140 --> 06:31.720]  is seeing all these articles and comments on Twitter and Instagram
[06:31.720 --> 06:34.300]  and on baseball card forums from people going,
[06:34.640 --> 06:36.460]  what the f*** is going on with Don Zimmer?
[06:37.040 --> 06:38.980]  Why is this card have value all of a sudden?
[06:39.320 --> 06:42.320]  It's been a thing. I mean, I guess we have to thank the audience
[06:42.320 --> 06:44.500]  because they have taken it to a whole level
[06:44.500 --> 06:48.020]  and the entire hobby is in mass confusion.
[06:48.120 --> 06:51.240]  And just reading the different theories has been incredible.
[06:51.600 --> 06:52.860]  They've ranged so far.
[06:53.160 --> 06:55.220]  Kudos to the audience because it is 100%.
[06:55.220 --> 06:58.020]  We pointed you guys in a direction or we presented an idea
[06:58.020 --> 07:00.600]  and the audience is how it happened, right?
[07:00.680 --> 07:04.100]  They ran with it and also proved a really interesting point,
[07:04.180 --> 07:07.380]  which is you can affect a market.
[07:07.660 --> 07:12.760]  It doesn't take that many people focused in a direction to affect a market.
[07:13.240 --> 07:14.100]  It really doesn't.
[07:14.180 --> 07:16.840]  I mean, how many people could have been buying Zimmer cards
[07:16.840 --> 07:21.100]  in the last month to make it explode into what it's become?
[07:21.380 --> 07:24.520]  Like, what does a Zimmer card go for on eBay right now?
[07:24.520 --> 07:25.840]  Do you know, Andrew, off the top of your head?
[07:26.420 --> 07:29.820]  I think it's ranging between $15 to $20 per card.
[07:30.100 --> 07:32.440]  I don't think I've seen one go for less than $15.
[07:32.540 --> 07:37.280]  I've been trying to buy one of every Zimmer card,
[07:37.580 --> 07:40.580]  kind of like I do with Marcus Smart, you know, just like every different one.
[07:40.740 --> 07:42.120]  And so I've got about six or seven now.
[07:42.220 --> 07:43.980]  And I was buying them for a buck apiece.
[07:44.040 --> 07:45.720]  And now I think the last one I bought for $12.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.100]  They're definitely getting up there.
[07:49.420 --> 07:53.740]  Also, Nick has written that the episode with the SMH actual reveal
[07:54.260 --> 07:55.040]  isn't out yet.
[07:56.060 --> 07:59.360]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's like, what can you do?
[07:59.500 --> 08:03.660]  It's not even worth having the conversation about because somehow I'm still wrong.
[08:03.940 --> 08:07.000]  So it doesn't matter what you just have to.
[08:07.160 --> 08:09.740]  You have to find something where Andrew Peters off.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.660]  And then the conversation can just sort of go.
[08:12.980 --> 08:15.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's think about this for a minute.
[08:15.260 --> 08:16.960]  I need to go in my head because I don't.
[08:17.040 --> 08:19.900]  I need because it would have been the following episode.
[08:20.060 --> 08:22.760]  The shake my head thing did not happen in the last episode that aired.
[08:22.760 --> 08:23.980]  It was the one before that.
[08:24.060 --> 08:25.840]  So we would have mentioned in that one.
[08:25.920 --> 08:29.120]  If we followed your order, is the whole point of the one that comes
[08:29.120 --> 08:32.020]  after the episode that just came out is that you weren't here.
[08:32.260 --> 08:36.260]  And one of the things you yelled about was the lack of reveal in that episode.
[08:36.400 --> 08:37.520]  Right. So I'm still right.
[08:37.800 --> 08:38.520]  My point is still valid.
[08:38.700 --> 08:40.580]  See, Gavin, isn't that what I just said?
[08:40.820 --> 08:42.720]  I said, don't why? Why even bother?
[08:43.100 --> 08:43.840]  Why even bother?
[08:44.280 --> 08:49.800]  I was extra trying to pay attention to what Andrew was saying and what his stance was.
[08:49.840 --> 08:52.240]  I don't I don't know what you mean.
[08:52.240 --> 08:54.280]  How is this not? This is OK.
[08:54.460 --> 08:57.620]  Because all I said was that the SMH reveal hasn't come out yet.
[08:57.900 --> 08:58.060]  Well, yeah.
[08:58.200 --> 09:01.120]  The one where Eric was like, you didn't even talk about SMH.
[09:01.520 --> 09:02.240]  That's yeah, I know.
[09:02.500 --> 09:03.240]  I'm aware of that.
[09:03.320 --> 09:06.420]  I'm addressing the fact that he yelled at us for not addressing it.
[09:06.840 --> 09:08.220]  And I said, go ahead.
[09:08.380 --> 09:12.760]  Before you go any further, I hate to cut in to further exacerbate things.
[09:12.760 --> 09:15.200]  But just to kind of reinforce what Gavin just said,
[09:15.580 --> 09:18.800]  I lost interest and I am not paying attention to anything y'all are talking about.
[09:18.860 --> 09:19.680]  I couldn't follow it.
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.880]  So y'all continue and just like loop me back in when you're done.
[09:24.540 --> 09:26.080]  Why even speak then?
[09:26.560 --> 09:27.600]  Why? Why comment?
[09:28.020 --> 09:29.880]  What's the point of you saying that?
[09:31.220 --> 09:32.180]  What are you doing?
[09:32.900 --> 09:33.940]  Are you talking to me?
[09:34.340 --> 09:35.300]  Yeah, I'm talking to you, Geoff.
[09:35.420 --> 09:37.160]  No, circle back to me when you're finished.
[09:37.340 --> 09:39.200]  No, I'm done at this point.
[09:39.300 --> 09:41.600]  I just don't understand the argument.
[09:41.720 --> 09:45.560]  So there's no point in listening because nothing anybody's saying is making any sense.
[09:45.800 --> 09:47.000]  I was just saying we got yelled at.
[09:47.040 --> 09:47.660]  We didn't need to be.
[09:47.660 --> 09:48.660]  I think we deserve.
[09:48.680 --> 09:49.600]  I think we deserve.
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.580]  I listened to that episode last night in bed.
[09:51.680 --> 09:53.280]  We definitely deserve to be yelled at.
[09:53.920 --> 09:54.820]  I don't know.
[09:54.880 --> 09:55.800]  I don't know about that.
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.480]  I'd say the reaction says otherwise.
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.360]  Have we started this podcast yet?
[10:03.780 --> 10:08.280]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[10:08.740 --> 10:09.920]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[10:10.080 --> 10:13.780]  With me, as always, Gavin Free and Lady Somaire.
[10:14.540 --> 10:17.080]  And what do you guys want to talk about this week?
[10:17.080 --> 10:25.440]  We solved, or I would say we crested Somaire Mountain and the SMH Mountains.
[10:26.040 --> 10:30.600]  And we have driven f***ing full steam through the Zimmer Zone and come out the other side.
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.340]  What do we have?
[10:32.520 --> 10:34.080]  I don't think we're done with the Zimmer Zone.
[10:34.580 --> 10:37.160]  I was curious what your guys' favorite theories have been.
[10:37.400 --> 10:38.600]  What theories have you heard?
[10:38.880 --> 10:42.920]  There's a group of people that believe that this was a money laundering scheme,
[10:43.060 --> 10:45.800]  which I think is a fantastic concept.
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.500]  The idea that anyone would launder money, $10 at a time, for Don Zimmer cards on eBay.
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.260]  At one point, the FBI was like, it's too low to be laundering.
[10:55.740 --> 11:05.420]  Yeah, I've heard that it's some sort of a Reddit group that exists to manipulate markets,
[11:05.600 --> 11:08.020]  kind of like GME, GameStop, Bitcoin.
[11:08.840 --> 11:15.580]  It's very NFT, new media, tech, scammy type stuff.
[11:16.280 --> 11:23.600]  I've heard that I was accused by somebody on some comment somewhere of setting all of this up
[11:23.600 --> 11:28.060]  just so that I could sell my personal collection of Don Zimmer cards and rake in a bunch of money.
[11:28.340 --> 11:34.420]  As if, once again, as if for the last 10 years I've been hoarding millions of Zimmer cards
[11:34.420 --> 11:37.520]  for $0.10 each so I could turn around and sell them for $8 a pop
[11:37.520 --> 11:39.780]  and slowly get rich $8 at a time.
[11:39.920 --> 11:42.260]  You would have to have a warehouse of so many.
[11:42.980 --> 11:47.000]  I'll get that. That's where I want to pour my energy.
[11:49.340 --> 11:53.620]  I'm just imagining somebody breaking down because their Zimmer warehouse caught fire.
[11:53.960 --> 11:57.340]  All their future profits. You've been holding these for so long.
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.880]  Yeah, it was great. There's a whole thing about how a shadowy group was buying the cards themselves,
[12:03.900 --> 12:09.280]  buying them at higher prices to try to generate hype and adjust the market. It was great.
[12:09.280 --> 12:12.940]  I saw another one. I saw another one the other day where people were speculating
[12:12.940 --> 12:16.840]  that this meant that more manager cards were going to become in vogue.
[12:16.900 --> 12:19.760]  And Zimmer was just a start. And people were like,
[12:19.780 --> 12:22.100]  who do you think is going to be next? And people were trying to figure out
[12:22.100 --> 12:23.720]  who the next hot manager is going to be.
[12:24.120 --> 12:29.440]  I like as well that it's actually going really well. It's quite big now.
[12:29.740 --> 12:32.060]  This is actually registering to people outside of this podcast.
[12:32.620 --> 12:35.680]  But I feel like our listeners... I can't...
[12:37.620 --> 12:40.500]  You feel like our listeners are... Hold on. Let me take it.
[12:40.580 --> 12:42.320]  Okay. Yeah. Okay. Roll back.
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.120]  I feel like our listeners...
[12:48.500 --> 12:55.850]  Why is this so hard for you? What are you doing? Why are you broken?
[13:00.930 --> 13:03.430]  Whatever point you're going to make is not going to be worth this.
[13:04.850 --> 13:09.050]  You should never have stopped. Can we push the recording one more day?
[13:09.090 --> 13:11.250]  You know you never get to start again.
[13:15.070 --> 13:17.530]  What's your point? I'd love to hear it.
[13:17.590 --> 13:21.470]  Well, I feel like our listeners are so true f*** faces that they're actually not
[13:21.470 --> 13:25.430]  letting anyone else know where it's coming from. They're all in on it with us.
[13:25.790 --> 13:28.750]  And I think that's the best part of it is that it's so big,
[13:28.770 --> 13:32.130]  but it's not big enough to the point where people are finding out where it's coming from.
[13:32.130 --> 13:35.070]  Totally agree. All the f*** facers out there
[13:35.070 --> 13:38.910]  that are taking part in this fun little experiment and enjoying this,
[13:39.250 --> 13:43.810]  thank you so much for keeping this close to your vest. It's been so wonderful to see
[13:44.370 --> 13:49.830]  people going out and looking to try to find the solution and not being able to.
[13:49.970 --> 13:53.870]  Can you believe I made that observation and told you about it in the first try?
[13:56.810 --> 13:57.890]  Delivered it perfectly.
[14:01.980 --> 14:05.980]  What a clear, interesting thought that you succinctly delivered.
[14:06.240 --> 14:07.280]  It was very concise.
[14:08.420 --> 14:13.760]  As somebody who just f***ing yelled at me for being confusing and not clear,
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.240]  I really appreciated the delivery you gave and I'm taking notes. I'm going to learn a lot from you.
[14:18.380 --> 14:25.680]  I'm bad at podcasting if I have to be quiet for a long time. If I'm listening for several minutes
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.580]  back to back, I start to get worked up in my own head when I should talk again. And then when I do,
[14:30.580 --> 14:34.980]  it's like... Dude, I do the same thing. You get like a car revving, you're like...
[14:35.860 --> 14:39.320]  Because you don't want to be quiet enough to the point where someone realizes that you've
[14:39.320 --> 14:41.680]  not said anything in a while, and then they ask you why you're not saying anything.
[14:41.900 --> 14:44.600]  You don't want to get to that point, but you want to chime in at some point,
[14:44.880 --> 14:46.160]  and it's hard to time in my head.
[14:46.360 --> 14:51.500]  Do you have the reverse where you get a spot and then you start talking? And then you think like,
[14:51.580 --> 14:55.440]  well, now they're listening to me, I better go. And then after a while, you're like,
[14:55.500 --> 14:59.460]  why am I still talking? And am I just saying the same thing over and over again in different ways?
[14:59.460 --> 15:03.200]  Because I had that earlier in the beginning of the podcast. I don't even remember what it was,
[15:03.200 --> 15:10.020]  but I remember going to loop, make a note to Nick to tell him to cut out like 45 seconds of some
[15:10.020 --> 15:14.980]  shit I said in the first 10 minutes. I think I get that much less frequently because I try and
[15:14.980 --> 15:21.000]  say everything and be done talking as quickly as possible. And I don't like it if I've like right
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.320]  now. What do you mean? It was going on too long. I wanted it to be over. I had to end it.
[15:26.940 --> 15:30.900]  Okay. I don't, I feel like you just stopped talking. I don't even feel like you made a
[15:30.900 --> 15:34.300]  point. Was your point that you have nothing? I don't know. I feel like I have like a hard
[15:34.300 --> 15:41.940]  30 second limit where if I've not stopped, then I've just got to pack it in. What about you,
[15:42.040 --> 15:46.180]  Andrew? Well, I'm still, we're still, what's going on with the Zimmer zone shirt? Is that
[15:46.180 --> 15:51.120]  out at this point? It's St. Patrick's Day, by the way, on this Earth. Happy St. Patrick's Day.
[15:51.120 --> 15:58.040]  Is it St. Patrick's Day? Really? What is that? March 17th. Oh, happy. That's cool. You know,
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.500]  that's, that means today is the fourth anniversary of the day I quit drinking.
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  Hey, accidentally on St. Patrick's Day. I had no idea.
[16:06.820 --> 16:10.800]  Your last drink. Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, I do. I remember my last five drinks because they
[16:10.800 --> 16:17.220]  happened in, well, I had, yeah, I remember my last five drinks. I had them in rapid succession. Yeah.
[16:19.780 --> 16:23.000]  I've told that story a million times. I don't want to bore anybody with old stories about me
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.240]  drinking and throwing up blood and stuff. But it was, it just so happens that March 17th is the
[16:29.240 --> 16:32.720]  four year, today is the four year anniversary of the last drink I took. So I don't think I know
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.600]  that story. You have to tell me offline. Yeah, it was like six in the morning. I was fucking,
[16:37.780 --> 16:46.300]  you know, drunk, drunk, drunk. And I got up and I was shaken. And so I took, I usually take shots in
[16:46.300 --> 16:51.240]  the morning. You know what? I'll tell you later. What? It's a sad story. You've gone way too far.
[16:51.800 --> 16:55.860]  Okay. That's far. That's fine. If you're going for darkness reasons, that's fine. I just like
[16:55.860 --> 17:00.380]  the idea of that morning. You're just like, that's enough. I'm done. All right. So I got up, you
[17:00.380 --> 17:05.080]  know, and I was like, it was six in the morning. I had Millie. Millie gets up. It's okay. I've
[17:05.080 --> 17:08.600]  told it on another podcast. Millie gets up. We can cut it from this. So it doesn't have to be in
[17:08.600 --> 17:13.860]  this podcast if you want to see it here. No, I'm fine with it. I don't understand why you've teased
[17:13.860 --> 17:17.760]  it like five times in the show and gone. I'll tell you online. Then you start telling it again.
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.760]  If you want to cut, we'll cut it. But also I don't care. I just don't want to bore the audience
[17:22.760 --> 17:27.960]  because the audience is probably, do you think, do you think just tell, just tell, tell the story,
[17:28.040 --> 17:31.760]  Geoff, please. Okay. So I was up one morning. Eric is making the story take longer.
[17:32.140 --> 17:38.060]  It's March 17th. It's during South by I'm off that week. I get up in the morning at six,
[17:38.220 --> 17:43.160]  you know, cause I'm an early riser and I got to take, get Millie up at seven. So I go into the
[17:43.160 --> 17:48.040]  kitchen and I take my morning, I take two shots of bullet whiskey every morning. Uh, well, if
[17:48.040 --> 17:50.880]  that's what I have, right at the time I had bullets. So I drank two shots of whiskey to kind
[17:50.880 --> 17:55.120]  of steady the nerves and it didn't steady my nerves. I was still shaking really bad. So I thought, Oh,
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.980]  I better take another shot. And that didn't work. So I took two more shots so that I could get to
[17:59.980 --> 18:04.100]  normal so that I could, you know, make breakfast and stuff for Millie because that's, you know,
[18:04.380 --> 18:10.400]  I was in a, I was in a bad way. And, uh, and when I, I swallowed the fifth shot, it, um,
[18:10.400 --> 18:16.200]  something happened to my stomach and it immediately, I went, it's coming up. And I turned to toward
[18:16.200 --> 18:21.900]  the bathroom as vomit, projectile vomited out of my mouth, across my entire kitchen,
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.520]  into my hallway. And it's in the old house, Gav, you know, that house, like, you know, where it
[18:26.520 --> 18:31.040]  kind of hit that wall over where the bathroom was and it was blood and shit. And I thought,
[18:31.640 --> 18:36.340]  A, that's not good. B, Millie's not awake yet. I don't want her to see this. And so I got down on
[18:36.340 --> 18:40.640]  hands and knees and I was like cleaning up blood and puke with my shirt because it's what I had.
[18:40.660 --> 18:43.620]  And I was all fucked up. And then I thought, I should probably stop. This is probably enough.
[18:43.780 --> 18:46.840]  And that was the, that was the, that was when I quit drinking. Well, I'm glad you did.
[18:47.060 --> 18:51.600]  Congrats on four. Thanks, man. Here's to many more. No, thanks. I appreciate it. It's always,
[18:51.960 --> 18:55.240]  um, I don't know if we should go into vomit stories if we're going to cut that, actually.
[18:55.560 --> 18:59.060]  Uh, it's okay. Never, never say never, you know, I don't want to be one of those people that says
[18:59.060 --> 19:02.900]  I'll never drink again, but I sure as hell hope I don't. I find that if I ever projectile vomit,
[19:02.900 --> 19:08.640]  usually from a previous night of drinking, I always like, if I'm not going to make it as a
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.080]  toilet, I always try and go for the mouth cover, but it's always the wrong move. I think you're
[19:13.080 --> 19:19.500]  much better off just vomiting forwards as you're walking because then it doesn't go on the ceiling
[19:19.500 --> 19:23.720]  and the walls through your hands. Totally agree. And you end up with a dirty hand that you have
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.480]  to clean before you can use your hand to clean. It's like vomiting on a broom.
[19:36.180 --> 19:39.100]  You're ruining the tool you need to clean it, right?
[19:42.060 --> 19:48.260]  I did not expect that analogy. It's a good one. I've never even considered vomiting in the hand,
[19:48.320 --> 19:51.700]  so you got to just embrace the projectile vomit when it happens. So when you vomit,
[19:51.920 --> 19:55.540]  project, when you projectile vomit, Andrew, do you just, are your arms at your sides?
[19:56.080 --> 20:02.640]  Oh yeah. Yeah. My, my arms are on my knees. I'm getting into as much force as I can. This
[20:02.640 --> 20:08.220]  is where we're at. I'm going to make the most of it. Just imagining a broom covered in vomit.
[20:11.080 --> 20:18.480]  You'd have to just throw it away. How do you clean a broom? I know, I know. It's a flawed
[20:18.480 --> 20:22.800]  analogy, right? Because it's like, it's not like if I was like, ah shit, the dog threw up,
[20:22.880 --> 20:27.180]  somebody grabbed the broom. It's not like I'm cleaning up puke with a broom. I should have
[20:27.180 --> 20:34.020]  mopped. Yeah. Mop would have been better. Or inside a small tub of Lysol strips or whatever.
[20:36.880 --> 20:40.360]  I feel like that's a paper towel fix. I don't think it's that hard to clean up. It's always
[20:40.360 --> 20:46.240]  tragic when you ruin a piece of cleaning equipment. And I feel like a vacuum is the same way.
[20:46.680 --> 20:50.960]  Because Dan told a story to me once where he just chunked off the side of his bed and then
[20:50.960 --> 20:54.400]  he cleaned it up with paper towels and then ended up just like vacuuming up the rest of it.
[20:54.400 --> 20:59.220]  But until he stopped using that vacuum cleaner years later, every time he vacuumed,
[20:59.520 --> 21:02.800]  just the smell of vomit would be pumped out of it, even though it's technically clean.
[21:03.340 --> 21:06.600]  There's just something about it was stored inside and it would always smell like chunk and he'd
[21:06.600 --> 21:14.540]  always be heaving when he was vacuuming. Gavin, it's so funny you say that. I just had that happen
[21:14.540 --> 21:22.580]  last week. You threw up in your Dyson? No, dude, no. But I don't fully know what happened and I
[21:22.580 --> 21:28.040]  haven't done the investigation to figure it out. But what I think happened, because I picked up my
[21:28.040 --> 21:32.880]  Dyson the other day, the cordless kind to clean up something, and it wasn't working and I went
[21:32.880 --> 21:40.740]  to clean the trap out and it was full of what appeared to be vomit, right? And what I dissected,
[21:40.780 --> 21:45.660]  because Millie wasn't here at the time, what I put together was that I think Arrow or Henry
[21:45.660 --> 21:51.100]  must have thrown up a bunch of dog food and then Millie tried to clean it up with the vacuum cleaner.
[21:51.840 --> 21:58.600]  And so it was just a bunch of wet, soggy dog food and puke clogging the thing up. I had to take,
[21:58.680 --> 22:04.020]  or Emily and I had to take, the entire thing apart piece by piece and hand clean the entire Dyson
[22:04.020 --> 22:09.040]  vacuum cleaner. And I was retching the whole time because it just smelled like... I don't know how
[22:09.040 --> 22:14.020]  long it had been in there. And all I can say, I look at it and I'm like, I wasn't mad, but at the
[22:14.020 --> 22:18.060]  same time I'm like, somebody, either Emily doesn't want to accept that she did this or Millie did it.
[22:18.060 --> 22:21.420]  Either way, they were trying to solve a problem. They were trying to clean something up,
[22:21.520 --> 22:25.200]  so I shouldn't be mad at them for, you know, trying to clean up this issue, but it was fucking
[22:25.200 --> 22:30.180]  stinky gross. There needs to be like a potpourri bomb or something that you can mow up in a vacuum
[22:30.180 --> 22:36.560]  that cleans the smells out automatically. Yeah. Are you a big cleaner, Andrew? How often do you
[22:36.560 --> 22:43.580]  tidy your shit? Because in my head you live in just a pigsty of waffles and trash. I don't live
[22:43.580 --> 22:48.440]  in a pigsty of waffles and trash. I still have the outline of when I was living in a pillow fort
[22:48.440 --> 22:53.060]  when we recorded these. I still have boxes all around my desk. But outside of that, things are
[22:53.060 --> 22:58.940]  okay. I wouldn't say it's too dirty. I'd love to have like a fucking Roomba or something though.
[22:59.240 --> 23:03.740]  That seems great. Those seem fun. I feel like they're a lot better in theory. Yeah, I could
[23:03.740 --> 23:08.140]  see that. If you get stuck on small stuff or if you've got cats, there's probably a cat toy getting
[23:08.140 --> 23:15.160]  wedged in it. I feel like they've decreased in functionality over time as they've improved,
[23:15.540 --> 23:20.200]  if that makes any sense. I got a new Roomba not too long ago because I had a bunch of Roombas. I
[23:20.200 --> 23:25.420]  was a huge Roomba proponent back in the day. We had the Roombas fight with knives, Gavin. I had
[23:25.420 --> 23:30.160]  the Dyson Roomba for a while that I gave up in the divorce. You had the one that ran over the dog
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.040]  turd and smeared it all over the house. Yeah, I had two instances of the dog shit happening,
[23:34.040 --> 23:42.300]  once with the Dyson, once with the Roomba. Which one handled it better? The Dyson was easier to
[23:42.300 --> 23:50.400]  clean. The Roomba died. It killed that Roomba. It never worked again. I got a new Roomba a couple
[23:50.400 --> 23:55.480]  months ago and it's like the brand new model. It's supposed to be the best one, but I feel like
[23:55.480 --> 24:01.660]  the lint trap or the vacuum trap where they collect all the shit is half the size of the
[24:01.660 --> 24:06.460]  old Roomba. So it doesn't even make it through one cycle before it has to be changed. The new
[24:06.460 --> 24:10.680]  fancy ones empty themselves, don't they? That's why they have a small hole. Well, they have that
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.300]  you can't buy. When I went to buy it, you couldn't buy the empty itself thing. Like you can get the
[24:15.300 --> 24:18.660]  Roomba, but you can't get the trap thing. They were just like not available. They were selling
[24:18.660 --> 24:24.640]  on eBay for like 1200 bucks just for that at the time. It's fucking ludicrous. Forget Zimmer.
[24:25.540 --> 24:29.680]  I know, right? But then this fucking this new Roomba who's lovely, but it gets caught on
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.900]  everything all the time, every day. I feel like Roombas have gotten worse as they've increased
[24:34.900 --> 24:41.320]  in price and I don't know, technology. Interesting theory. What's the worst thing you have on your
[24:41.320 --> 24:49.080]  desk? You have a clean desk? Worst thing. Worst thing. Like I'll just put something on my desk
[24:49.080 --> 24:54.200]  and forget it's there. I just pulled the waffle bomb out. It's still on my desk. Oh, come on. Why
[24:54.200 --> 24:58.640]  is that on your desk? It's just there. I think I moved it. I was scared it was going to get
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.900]  knocked over where it was before, so I put it in the corner of my desk. I thought, do I still have
[25:02.900 --> 25:08.220]  this? I do. I just can't concentrate. If my desk is full of trash, I can't. Like if there's an
[25:08.220 --> 25:13.340]  empty mug or a drink that I've already drank, I can't have like an empty glass and stuff. I've
[25:13.340 --> 25:18.340]  got to get rid of that shite because I'll knock it over. Why? Why? Why is that the case for you
[25:18.340 --> 25:24.280]  at home? But at work, your desk has 7000 half empty cups and you don't give a shit. I tell you
[25:24.280 --> 25:29.200]  why, because that's not my trash. My desk is the closest to the door. People leave their- I don't
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.700]  drink out of cans. People leave their shite all over my desk. They carve holes in it. They write all over it.
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.240]  They kick it in half. I'm not dealing with my desk at work. That is- that is the work- that is the
[25:39.240 --> 25:45.520]  office's desk and I can't care about it. If I care about it, I'll get upset when someone kicks it
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.840]  off, won't I? Some of that's true, but all those fucking Dixie cups are yours, buddy. You're the
[25:50.840 --> 25:54.780]  one that walks over to the water machine and fucking gets a little half cup thing of water
[25:54.780 --> 25:59.580]  and then leaves it there until you've got, uh, like, a baker's dozen of them on your desk. Yeah, but it's only
[25:59.580 --> 26:06.200]  water. It's not sticky shit that's gonna get all mold and like- It's only water. It's only 17
[26:06.200 --> 26:11.720]  half empty or half full cups of water on a desk full of a computer equipment where we throw shit
[26:11.720 --> 26:16.480]  around constantly. Yeah, but over the space of six months, that's pretty decent because I can reuse
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.280]  those cups. So I keep going back and forth until I wake up and there's a cockroach in one of them,
[26:20.280 --> 26:25.340]  which has happened. It's a miracle you don't get, uh, fucking knock a moon ball into one of them and
[26:25.340 --> 26:29.640]  short-circuit something and set the whole place on fire. Have you ever, have you realized that
[26:30.100 --> 26:35.860]  electronics are actually pretty resilient to liquids? Like, I spilled drinks and water all over pretty
[26:35.860 --> 26:40.340]  much everything electronic at some point in my life. I don't think I've ever broken anything
[26:40.340 --> 26:46.700]  from water. Yeah, Millie, uh, Millie told me, I don't know, maybe a year ago, her MacBook, she
[26:46.700 --> 26:52.460]  spilled a Dr. Pepper, I think it was, in her MacBook Air. And she was like, uh, it doesn't
[26:52.460 --> 26:56.140]  work anymore. And I was like, turn it upside down and check on it in a week. Millie's still using
[26:56.140 --> 27:02.440]  that MacBook Air to this day. Yeah, I had a thing where my cat knocked an iPad into the bath and I,
[27:03.080 --> 27:06.740]  while I was listening to it, I wasn't in the bath, but I was about to get in and watch something.
[27:07.300 --> 27:12.260]  And, uh, my AirPods just suddenly cut out because I guess Wi-Fi or Bluetooth doesn't work through
[27:12.620 --> 27:17.420]  water. It just instantly cut it off. And I just saw the splash. I was like, God damn it. Cause
[27:17.420 --> 27:23.280]  they're not cheap, them iPads. Yeah. Didn't work. I left it, I turned it, I left it off for a couple
[27:23.280 --> 27:27.140]  of weeks. Uh, I didn't bother with the rice thing cause I heard that's a load of bollocks. So I just
[27:27.140 --> 27:31.320]  left it. Uh, it didn't work after two weeks, started charging it, still didn't work. I just
[27:31.320 --> 27:37.320]  chucked it in a drawer. About nine months later, I tried again and it works. It was, I guess,
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.980]  needed longer than two weeks or the opposite. Like I got, when I got my iPhone 10, I was having a
[27:42.980 --> 27:45.800]  conversation with Emily about how they're waterproof. And I was by the pool and she's
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.560]  like, they say they're waterproof, but they're not waterproof. So I dunked my iPhone 10 in the
[27:49.560 --> 27:57.260]  water to show her they were waterproof. Didn't work for two days. It immediately broke. And I
[27:57.260 --> 28:02.540]  had to go put it in. I had to put it in rice at Emily's old place. Exactly. She had the pool
[28:02.540 --> 28:08.800]  two days immediately broke. Didn't you also get that Insta360 camera? And the first thing you
[28:08.800 --> 28:12.780]  did was you put it in water and it wasn't waterproof. Oh, big time, dude. That thing
[28:12.780 --> 28:18.620]  spent more time underwater than above water. Yeah, there was nothing waterproof about that.
[28:19.020 --> 28:24.800]  And you also, you also thought you were taking videos, but you were just taking pictures of
[28:24.800 --> 28:31.800]  yourself looking into it. A couple of grandparents trying to figure out.
[28:32.680 --> 28:37.060]  I'll find that photo and I'll have, I'll have them put it up on the, on the Instagram.
[28:37.420 --> 28:39.780]  Yeah, we've mentioned that before. It's pretty, it's so funny to me.
[28:44.550 --> 28:50.310]  I don't know about you, but I feel like I'm always looking at a screen and now more than ever. Also,
[28:50.310 --> 28:55.550]  when you're an avid news watcher or in serious need of a distraction, unplugging yourself is
[28:55.550 --> 29:01.870]  easier said than done. Uh, my entire life, uh, could be used as a case study for that thesis.
[29:02.490 --> 29:06.530]  One of my favorite ways to rest my eyes though, and still get the content I'm itching for
[29:06.530 --> 29:13.070]  is by putting on my Raycon wireless earbuds and listening to something great. I don't want to look
[29:13.070 --> 29:18.110]  at shit. I want to listen to it. Whether you're catching up on your favorite news podcast,
[29:18.550 --> 29:22.450]  binging an audio book or powering through your workout with a pumped up playlist,
[29:22.450 --> 29:27.770]  a pair of Raycons in your ears can make all the difference. All of it. Every single amount
[29:27.770 --> 29:33.630]  of difference can be made. I personally endorse Raycons. I think they're a game changer. No
[29:33.630 --> 29:40.410]  dangling wires or stems. Those get in your way, but not with Raycons. Why? They come in a range
[29:40.410 --> 29:47.130]  of stylish colorways like sneakers, but also with a comfortable in-ear fit for a more discreet look.
[29:47.250 --> 29:51.150]  So they might look as cool as those Air Jordans, but they're not as uncomfortable because they're
[29:51.150 --> 29:57.010]  discreet and secret. Raycons are built to perform anywhere and anytime, which is convenient because
[29:57.010 --> 30:01.790]  anywhere and anytime is where you often find yourself. With water and sweat resistant
[30:01.790 --> 30:07.190]  construction and Bluetooth that pairs quickly and seamlessly, it's a joy. And with enough battery
[30:07.190 --> 30:13.030]  life for six hours of playtime, have you ever played anything for six hours? You're crazy if
[30:13.030 --> 30:17.230]  you think you can right now. You're not in that kind of shape. Yeah, you're thinking of the old
[30:17.230 --> 30:22.950]  you. The one from the before times. Yeah, the one with abs. That's not you anymore. You can't
[30:22.950 --> 30:26.730]  handle more than six hours of playtime. That's more than enough for you. It's plenty. But that's
[30:26.730 --> 30:31.410]  not the best part. The best part is the part that I haven't told you yet. The nugget of information
[30:31.410 --> 30:36.670]  that I'm holding on because knowledge is power and I have power over you. And once I tell you
[30:36.670 --> 30:40.850]  the best part, then I'm going to democratize the power. And then there goes my power, right?
[30:41.150 --> 30:45.550]  That being said, I have to say it, so I'm just going to get it out of the way. Raycon makes great sound
[30:45.550 --> 30:50.070]  accessible to everyone there. I said it. It's with the wireless earbuds because they started
[30:50.070 --> 30:55.390]  half the price of the other premium audio brands. I said the whole thing. Now everybody knows. Raycon
[30:55.390 --> 31:00.050]  is offering 15% off all their products for my listeners. And here's what you've got to do to
[31:00.050 --> 31:07.450]  get it. Go to buyraycon.com slash face. That's it. You'll get 15% off your entire Raycon order.
[31:07.670 --> 31:14.890]  So feel free to grab a pair and a spare. Those two words rhyme. That's 15% off at buyraycon.com
[31:14.890 --> 31:21.970]  slash face. Buyraycon.com slash face. And now a break from our podcast to speak about Postmates.
[31:22.210 --> 31:27.150]  If you're like me, you start thinking about what to eat for dinner when you're eating lunch. And
[31:27.150 --> 31:31.070]  you start thinking about what to eat for lunch always. You're always thinking about food. You're
[31:31.070 --> 31:37.170]  hungry. That's the point. I love it. I love food. I love eating it. I love preparing it. I love
[31:37.170 --> 31:41.750]  thinking about it. I love dreaming about it. But sometimes getting into my kitchen and cooking
[31:41.750 --> 31:47.810]  something delicious to eat doesn't make it on my to-do list. It makes it on my to think about list
[31:47.810 --> 31:54.050]  and to fancify list and to daydream about list, but it doesn't make it on my actual put effort
[31:54.050 --> 31:58.430]  into it list, which is why Postmates is pretty cool. With Postmates, you can get food delivered
[31:58.430 --> 32:02.370]  without leaving the house or even opening your front door. I mean, eventually you will have to
[32:02.370 --> 32:08.190]  open your front door. But what they do is they put the food or items in front of you and then
[32:08.190 --> 32:12.290]  like ring your doorbell or knock. You can even give them instructions and then they take off.
[32:12.410 --> 32:16.930]  And then when you feel safe, you open the door. This is the part where you do have to open a door
[32:16.930 --> 32:21.150]  at some point and then you bring the stuff in and then you shut the door. Don't forget to shut the
[32:21.150 --> 32:25.410]  door. They offer a pickup option too, though, in which case you're also going to open your door
[32:25.410 --> 32:29.490]  because you're going to have to open your door to go out to get into your car or truck or van to
[32:29.490 --> 32:34.330]  drive to the location to do the pickup thing. So be prepared for that. Anyway, they do offer a pickup
[32:34.330 --> 32:39.150]  option. And I do that sometimes if I feel like getting out of the house, it gives me purpose
[32:39.150 --> 32:45.070]  for a minute. I can say like, hey, I also matter. I can go out of the house and I can go have a
[32:45.070 --> 32:51.730]  little chore, a little mission. And the XP I receive is food. So that's fun. And it's a great
[32:51.730 --> 32:56.410]  way to support local restaurants. It is very important that we support and uplift our communities
[32:56.410 --> 33:02.010]  right now. And what better way than with food? And Postmates isn't all just burgers and sushi,
[33:02.010 --> 33:06.270]  although it definitely is those things sometimes at the same time. But you can also
[33:06.270 --> 33:12.630]  order anything from toilet paper, which has become almost a unit of currency in this current climate,
[33:12.770 --> 33:17.270]  to phone chargers from places like Walgreens or 7-Eleven. And they'll drop it right outside
[33:17.270 --> 33:21.610]  your front door, too. Once again, at some point, you're going to have to open that door. So just
[33:21.610 --> 33:26.470]  download Postmates on iOS or Android, find your favorites and get anything you want delivered
[33:26.470 --> 33:31.370]  within the hour, within reason. For a limited time, Postmates is giving our listeners five

[33:57.290 --> 34:00.990]  a Port-a-Potty. What's up with this fucking Port-a-Potty? It's in Dallas. It was supposed to,
[34:00.990 --> 34:05.350]  I guess with the storm, it got pushed back for delivery. It hit Dallas today, so I imagine early
[34:05.350 --> 34:09.710]  next week. But where's it coming from? Why didn't you order a local one? Well, I just, I bought,
[34:09.910 --> 34:14.350]  I went online and I bought a Port-a-Potty. What do you mean? It seems like you've moved a Port-a-Potty
[34:14.350 --> 34:19.050]  across the whole of the United States. Where's it from? I think I did, actually. I think it,
[34:19.210 --> 34:25.230]  I think I bought it from a place based in Colorado. Why didn't you buy one that was in Austin? Look,
[34:25.230 --> 34:32.030]  here's the deal. It's gonna get redirected to Rooster Teeth anyway. There's no way it
[34:32.030 --> 34:37.030]  stays in my yard. You've got to use it at least once in your yard. Yeah, absolutely.
[34:38.230 --> 34:43.150]  I don't think I do. I don't think I do. No, you definitely do. I really think you should record
[34:43.150 --> 34:50.790]  one episode of F*** Face from inside there. You think that now? You won't after 30 seconds of
[34:50.790 --> 34:53.810]  hearing me in it with the echo. You're gonna go like, all right, all right, all right, tear it
[34:53.810 --> 35:00.730]  down. We can't, it's impossible to talk to you. I think, yeah, I agree with Gavin. I think that's
[35:00.730 --> 35:05.290]  absolutely a move you have to do. Yeah, well, I'll believe it when a giant pink Port-a-Potty
[35:05.290 --> 35:08.890]  shows up in my front yard because I've been hearing that for three episodes. That's fair.
[35:09.210 --> 35:13.390]  It should be coming soon. This could be the long play. This could be utter bulls**t and he never
[35:13.390 --> 35:20.590]  ordered one again. I'd be, no, I, I would, I would almost be more annoyed at that than if it's a real
[35:20.590 --> 35:25.670]  Port-a-Potty because he really has me believing it's coming. Like, I really don't want to believe
[35:25.670 --> 35:31.290]  it, but I do. Eric, I have a question. I have a business question. Yeah. This is just a crew
[35:31.290 --> 35:35.650]  conversation, not for the audience, but we should leave it in anyway. We have sponsors every week,
[35:35.810 --> 35:42.390]  several. Why do we have zero dollars towards the budget of F*** Face? Oh, do you think that that's
[35:42.390 --> 35:50.770]  how that works? Uh, yeah, I mean, okay. Yeah. Okay. Because it, cause this people pay to
[35:50.770 --> 35:55.770]  advertise on everything you're about to say. I a hundred percent agree with, I'm not asking Andrew
[35:55.770 --> 36:03.670]  paying out of his own Canadian pocket for bogs in that. And I feel like you used corporate money.
[36:03.830 --> 36:09.670]  Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, no, I, I, everything you're saying, I agree with a hundred percent,
[36:09.670 --> 36:17.170]  but I'm not the guy. I'm not the guy who makes the money happen. I am given the money that I'm
[36:17.170 --> 36:22.510]  given for each show. And I just feel like, you know, give and take support. Uh-huh. I agree.
[36:22.650 --> 36:27.590]  And we need to start taking, I just don't know how to do that. Cause Geoff's doing all the giving.
[36:28.170 --> 36:33.690]  Right. What does that mean? Well, you're doing all the ad reads. Uh-huh. Oh, that's true. I do
[36:33.690 --> 36:40.890]  all the goddamn ad reads and buy them. Yeah. Boy, do I love it. I mean, who do you want to do the
[36:40.890 --> 36:46.890]  ad reads? No, no, that's fine. I'm doing it. Uh, I was just about to say, uh, I, I, I appreciate all
[36:46.890 --> 36:52.150]  of the sponsors that sponsor our podcast and make it possible for us to continue. Although, although
[36:52.150 --> 36:57.210]  I do have one complaint still about the ads. Um, what's that? I feel like there's gotta be someone
[36:57.210 --> 37:04.150]  out there who used the code, you know, instead of face. Yeah. Hmm. I feel like the first company
[37:04.150 --> 37:09.070]  to go all in on that. That'd be a great ad read. I think you're right. Okay. I can run that up and
[37:09.070 --> 37:14.250]  I can also see about getting more budget for the show. More than zero. Yeah, absolutely.
[37:17.270 --> 37:23.470]  I got sent a, uh, a missed opportunity. This wasn't a thing when this came about. There is
[37:23.470 --> 37:28.370]  a portable small toilet that you can buy from, I think it was Home Depot. That is a Zimmer toilet.
[37:28.870 --> 37:34.070]  Zimmer bucket. Zimmer bucket toilet. All comes back to the Zimmer zone. Is that the brand? Zimmer?
[37:34.230 --> 37:38.530]  Yeah. The brand of the toilet, like the company that makes it was a Zimmer, I believe. The Zimmer
[37:38.530 --> 37:43.490]  bucket toilet for like camping. I wonder if anybody from Don Zimmer's family is still alive.
[37:43.870 --> 37:48.270]  I thought about that too. You think he might be the last Zimmer? He could be the last Zimmer.
[37:48.290 --> 37:53.250]  Did he have kids? I'm the last Ramsey in my line. Uh, if Millie doesn't have kids and
[37:53.710 --> 37:59.930]  name them Ramsey, I guess. I'm the last male Ramsey. How long has Zimmer been dead?
[38:00.390 --> 38:06.670]  Uh, he died like 10 years ago, maybe. Right? Andrew, when did Zimmer die? I feel like 10 years ago. I
[38:06.670 --> 38:11.630]  think that's right. Yeah. Somewhere around there. It is a shame. It was a huge loss. 2014.
[38:12.190 --> 38:19.130]  Seven years ago. Did he have kids? He has three children. Three children. Okay. Oh, the porta potty came
[38:19.130 --> 38:22.570]  from Indiana. Just so you know, Gavin. Answer your question. I don't know what that is. Is that
[38:22.570 --> 38:26.890]  somewhere in the middle? Yeah. That's kind of, that seems befitting because Indiana, uh, is often
[38:26.890 --> 38:33.910]  considered the toilet of America. So I wonder if his kids know how much joy he's bring, he still
[38:33.910 --> 38:38.570]  brings the world. Like, obviously they know how much joy he brought the world when he was with us.
[38:38.730 --> 38:43.210]  Uh, and how much joy he brought his family, no doubt as well. But, but, uh, since his unfortunate
[38:43.210 --> 38:51.230]  passing, he has, uh, lived a new life, if you will. An infamous life that has only just started. And
[38:51.230 --> 38:57.210]  I bet his children have no idea. This new technology zimmer that, uh, that exists. Since looking at
[38:57.210 --> 39:03.370]  that picture of his hat getting pushed in his eyes, I've watched the clip. I didn't realize that it
[39:03.370 --> 39:10.450]  wasn't a fight at all. It was like a half second moment where he ran at someone and the other guy
[39:10.450 --> 39:14.990]  just pushed him to the ground. There wasn't any scrap whatsoever. He just charged like a bull.
[39:17.390 --> 39:21.810]  I don't even know. I don't even know if I could say it was a shove. Like it reminds me of when
[39:21.810 --> 39:25.990]  you watch those like Zen master, like martial arts videos where they like sidestep and the
[39:25.990 --> 39:30.110]  guy falls over. Like he put his hat in front of his face and then Zimmer just goes down.
[39:30.510 --> 39:36.050]  I don't know if I've laughed harder. He bounced so hard as well. The only way it could have been
[39:36.050 --> 39:41.590]  more embarrassing is if Pedro Martinez just stuck out his right hand and it hit Zimmer's forehead
[39:41.590 --> 39:49.710]  and Zimmer just ran in place swinging his arms. Oh, it's so funny. I mean, it's not funny. I mean,
[39:49.990 --> 39:55.070]  the actual like written in on paper, it's not funny. It's very funny though. It's hard to
[39:55.070 --> 39:59.890]  describe. Zimmer knew what he was doing when he charged him. Come on. It's a lunatic. Do you think
[39:59.890 --> 40:04.310]  Zimmer would go for a second charge? Because it just stopped. Look, it could have gone the other
[40:04.310 --> 40:10.510]  way. Everybody remembers when fucking who was it? Robin Ventura charged the mound on Nolan Ryan.
[40:10.510 --> 40:15.210]  Robin Ventura was like 20 years old. Nolan Ryan was like 45 and Nolan Ryan beat the shit out of
[40:15.210 --> 40:19.190]  him. Zimmer might have thought it was going that way for him. He's like, I got, I may have 30 years
[40:19.190 --> 40:25.310]  on Pedro Martinez, but I got Nolan Ryan energy. And then suddenly he couldn't, he could only see
[40:25.310 --> 40:36.650]  the inside of his hat and then he was on the ground. I wonder what his goal was. What his
[40:36.650 --> 40:41.190]  move? Did he have a plan? Did he have like a right hook he was loading up on? Like what, what did he
[40:41.190 --> 40:46.130]  want to happen when he began the bull rush? Did he just go for a collar grab? I'd love to know
[40:46.130 --> 40:49.130]  what his strategy was. I reckon he was trying to flip him over his shoulders, like literally like
[40:49.130 --> 40:53.930]  a bull. Yeah. I think he was like, I think it was going to be like the charger in Left 4 Dead 2,
[40:53.990 --> 41:00.470]  right? Just run right through him. I didn't stop until I hit a wall.
[41:07.040 --> 41:09.880]  I don't think anyone falling has brought me this much joy.
[41:10.360 --> 41:16.140]  I've laughed so much just watching him fall. It's great. Ah, there's one other fall I think
[41:16.140 --> 41:20.580]  that's up there, which is the Kelsey Grammer fall. That thing, that lives in infamy as well.
[41:20.780 --> 41:25.400]  Another Kelsey face favorite. Yeah. Oh dear Lord. I don't, I'm not familiar with the Kelsey Grammer
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.300]  fall. When did Kelsey Grammer fall? Hold on a second. Let me find it for you. Okay.
[41:31.700 --> 41:35.560]  You don't want to, you don't, you need to see it in your life if you've never seen Kelsey Grammer
[41:35.560 --> 41:39.600]  fall. I love a good fall. It's also, it's just so great that it's him, you know?
[41:40.420 --> 41:46.900]  Why? It's just because he's just such a straight-laced, like, serious, boring person.
[41:48.880 --> 41:54.040]  And then for him to fall in such a funny way, his reaction, his reaction is the funny part.
[41:54.240 --> 42:01.500]  Kelsey Grammer falls. We might get Andrew's live reaction to, uh... I'm very excited to
[42:01.500 --> 42:06.500]  watch Kelsey Grammer fall. Andrew's live reaction. Hold on a second. All right, here we go. It's,
[42:06.500 --> 42:11.700]  he's talking to kids at Disney World, I believe. It's about his experiences at Disney World.
[42:12.740 --> 42:16.260]  All right, Andrew, give it a watch. You got to listen too, so be sure to listen. Yeah,
[42:16.320 --> 42:20.580]  I'm listening. I'm going to watch this. It looks like a very dark room in defense of Kelsey
[42:20.580 --> 42:26.540]  Grammer. Kelsey G... I love it's just called Kelsey G, 35 seconds, the appropriate length for
[42:26.540 --> 42:48.790]  a fall video. I think I'm okay now. I love the ensuing, like, 20 seconds of people checking on
[42:48.790 --> 42:56.860]  him and he's just like... Did he continue the speech? Did he go back to talk about it's a
[42:56.860 --> 43:07.940]  small world or whatever he was saying? If not audience, I highly encourage you to go to YouTube
[43:07.940 --> 43:13.440]  and look that clip up. Do you think that would be in the top three internet fools? I feel like
[43:13.440 --> 43:19.320]  Grape Lady has to be number one. Oh, Grape Lady's gotta be number one. There's nothing better than
[43:19.320 --> 43:27.180]  her. I mean, Grape Lady was pretty good, but she's, I mean, doing a stupid thing. Like the
[43:27.180 --> 43:32.200]  grape, like it's a goofy, she's doing something goofy or like acting into the goofiness. Kelsey
[43:32.200 --> 43:39.420]  Grammer couldn't be more serious talking about his interpreter. Yes. She got what was she...
[43:39.420 --> 43:44.440]  Grape Lady got what was coming to her because she tried to cheat on the grape race. Yeah. So,
[43:44.560 --> 43:49.140]  you know, there's like some comeuppance there, but Kelsey Grammer, he was just boring some people
[43:49.140 --> 43:54.720]  in an auditorium. Just being a boring ass old, boring dude in an auditorium. And he,
[43:54.840 --> 44:03.580]  and then the next thing you know, he's like, oh, oh, oh, good Lord. He fell fucking far too for
[44:03.580 --> 44:08.760]  how old that motherfucker is. You know that, you know that hurt. Oh, he just missed the stage.
[44:08.840 --> 44:17.800]  He didn't even trip. He just tried to walk beyond the stage. I wonder, I would like,
[44:17.800 --> 44:22.440]  I wonder what the audience, what's your favorite Internet falling video? It's got to be specific
[44:22.440 --> 44:26.100]  to somebody falling or tripping. I would love to know what else is out there that we're not
[44:26.100 --> 44:35.840]  thinking of right now. What's your, Andrew, what's your all time? I can't believe you've
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.960]  never seen it. I can't believe we had that whole Kelsey Grammer conversation about when you tried
[44:40.960 --> 44:47.080]  to gain his stock market or whatever. Yeah, this is this is great. I feel like I have a lack of
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.180]  knowledge. I'm just an appreciator of the fall. I think the fall is a great thing. It's so
[44:52.180 --> 44:57.480]  embarrassing. There's no recovery from it. You can't suddenly get out of a fall. It's just a
[44:57.480 --> 45:02.400]  wonderful. What's this? Are you guys familiar with this fall video that Eric posted? Oh,
[45:02.540 --> 45:08.400]  Sal Governale? Yeah, this is long. Oh, I've not seen this. When's the fall happen? Yeah, about 15
[45:08.400 --> 45:13.000]  seconds in. OK, yeah. Geoff, you know that you haven't seen this? No, I've never seen it. Oh,
[45:13.000 --> 45:18.220]  this is great. What is this? It's Sal being Sal. And then he's Sal right off the stage.
[45:18.940 --> 45:23.440]  Was that Gary over there trying to get him off stage? Yeah, I think so. Is that is that? And
[45:23.440 --> 45:31.100]  that's already. Yeah. Oh, he falls hard. Yeah, he does. Is he wearing like a bababooey mask too?
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.420]  What a fucking idiot. Yeah, he's like he's like dancing around and all this stuff. Oh,
[45:36.180 --> 45:42.740]  he does like the arm thing off the stage. He does like the breakdance as he falls. That's awesome.
[45:42.740 --> 45:48.340]  So here's the thing. They liked it so much on Stern that they did an 11 minute special on Howard
[45:48.340 --> 45:54.700]  TV specifically about Sal falling off the stage. I don't know how I I don't know how I missed that.
[45:54.740 --> 45:58.400]  I never saw it. I don't either. It's great. I don't think I've ever seen you outsterned.
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.000]  Yeah, really. And that's not even a hard one. Dude, I'm not even I'm not even close to the
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.840]  biggest Stern fan in the company now. Jordan is huge Stern fan. Ryan Hall, Eric. There's a couple
[46:08.840 --> 46:12.300]  other new employees that are big Stern fans. Yeah. Wayne is a is a big Stern fan, apparently.
[46:13.120 --> 46:20.220]  It's growing numbers at a time when when Stern is dying. I had a I had a memory of another face
[46:20.220 --> 46:24.880]  that happened. I think, yeah, this was the week I moved to America because I feel like, Geoff,
[46:25.160 --> 46:29.800]  that was when you were at the height of your just screwing with me wherever you could,
[46:29.900 --> 46:35.580]  like lying to me about the price of driving tests and such. Yeah, I I moved to America with just
[46:35.580 --> 46:42.240]  the important stuff because I figured I'd get a lot of stuff when I got there. The stuff that I
[46:42.240 --> 46:47.380]  when I can just buy some there. But the first night in your house, I didn't have any shampoos.
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.220]  I was like, you got any? Can I just borrow some shampoo for tonight? And you were like, yeah,
[46:51.220 --> 46:55.780]  there's one in there. Don't use this one. Just use whatever else is in there. And I was like,
[46:55.800 --> 46:59.740]  all right, OK. And I used the other one, the one that you didn't not the one you didn't want me to
[46:59.740 --> 47:04.920]  use. And it just smelled a bit weird. I was like, it's different, I guess. American shampoo might
[47:04.920 --> 47:11.440]  have different flavors. Finished rinsing it out. And my hair was all like it was a bit weird.
[47:11.440 --> 47:15.840]  Just felt a bit weird. I went back to have a look. It was, uh, it was pet shampoo for poppies.
[47:17.720 --> 47:21.780]  And after work the next day, because I just went straight to work. I slept, woke up,
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.500]  showered with that, went straight to work. After work, the night we got home, I was like,
[47:25.520 --> 47:28.540]  ah, damn, I didn't get any shampoo again. So I went in there and had to use it again.
[47:28.940 --> 47:34.440]  You used dog shampoo! I used dog shampoo the first two nights that I spent in America.
[47:35.380 --> 47:38.360]  I used dog shampoo because I wasn't allowed to use your fancy one.
[47:38.960 --> 47:43.900]  You didn't tell me that there was pet shampoo right next to the human shampoo. Who leaves
[47:43.900 --> 47:49.180]  their pet goods next to all the human stuff? They're like with a fluffy mane.
[47:52.620 --> 47:59.680]  What do you mean I told you not to use the fancy shampoo? It's not like I have shampoo that's like
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.340]  only for me. It's like you can't use the good stuff. That's only, that's like we only bring
[48:05.340 --> 48:09.400]  out the fine china and the fancy shampoo for Christmas. You said something specifically
[48:09.820 --> 48:15.960]  not using one of them, use the other one. I probably told you don't use the pet shampoo.
[48:16.260 --> 48:23.940]  It's for the dog. Use the human shampoo, you fucking idiot. You fucking idiot. If there were
[48:23.940 --> 48:31.180]  two shampoos and I told you not to use one, I goddamn told you not to use the non-human shampoo
[48:31.180 --> 48:37.640]  and you fucked it up, you dummy. I'm not taking the heat, I'm not taking the heat because you're
[48:37.640 --> 48:45.260]  illiterate. You weren't trying to get me to use your dog shampoo. No! Maybe. Was I? I don't know.
[48:45.620 --> 48:52.820]  Because I think it was, I think it was someone else's. I think it was like specifically,
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.640]  I think there might have been another cheaper shampoo in there but it wasn't where you said
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.140]  it was. It might have been in the cupboard or something. But there was definitely some dog
[49:01.140 --> 49:07.600]  shampoo out. Did you enjoy it? Was it good? Was it better than human shampoo? No. No, it smelled
[49:07.600 --> 49:13.140]  weird. One of two things happened. Either you're a fucking idiot and you misunderstood what I told
[49:13.140 --> 49:18.260]  you and you used dog shampoo over human. I was jet lagged. Or I'm a fucking genius and I pulled
[49:18.260 --> 49:23.340]  off a hilarious prank that I forgot about and didn't find out about until 12 years later.
[49:23.340 --> 49:29.140]  I guess I'm okay with either resolution. And it was definitely a move for me to
[49:29.140 --> 49:32.640]  deliberately use it for the second time. And after that shower, after I got dry,
[49:32.980 --> 49:36.480]  I walked straight to the supermarket and got like three shampoos.
[49:40.510 --> 49:45.110]  Wow. The amount of stuff in my life where I think you've messed with me and you haven't.
[49:45.290 --> 49:50.030]  It's unbelievable. I don't know. Maybe I did mess with you. I don't know. I'm pretty sure
[49:50.030 --> 49:54.730]  I didn't throw a giant branch at your forehead. You've just done such good work that you can now
[49:54.730 --> 49:59.370]  take credit for just the things that happen to me normally. I don't know. I would love to go back
[49:59.370 --> 50:03.130]  because chances are, you know, we were on the bevs. It was exciting. I just switched countries.
[50:03.310 --> 50:10.250]  So I may have completely heard the opposite of what you're telling me. But I don't think I'm that...
[50:10.250 --> 50:12.850]  How wrong can you get that? I don't think I would have been like,
[50:12.950 --> 50:17.170]  I'm going to use the one he told me not to use. You got a 50-50 shot.
[50:17.170 --> 50:27.070]  You also picked up a container clearly labeled Pet Shampoo. Probably had a picture of a dog on it,
[50:27.130 --> 50:31.310]  I'm going to assume. Probably like a golden retriever or some dog with like beautiful,
[50:31.670 --> 50:38.270]  like an Irish setter with like beautiful flowing fucking dog hair that probably said Acme Pet
[50:38.270 --> 50:42.950]  Shampoo. And you held it up in your right hand, you're right-handed, and you looked at it,
[50:42.950 --> 50:47.430]  had eye contact with it while you squeezed it into your left hand the whole time looking at it.
[50:47.610 --> 50:52.070]  Then your eyes followed as you put it down and then you went back and you washed your hair.
[50:52.130 --> 50:56.590]  So you were, you had eye contact with dog shampoo for at least a minute and a half.
[50:56.930 --> 51:02.310]  No one continues to read. If I, if my eyes saw the word shampoo on a thing that was by a bath,
[51:02.610 --> 51:06.790]  I'm not going to keep reading. If that was the first one I saw, I'm set. That's shampoo.
[51:07.390 --> 51:10.650]  I tell you what, if I was in somebody else's bathroom and I was looking to get clean,
[51:11.070 --> 51:14.250]  everything I picked up, I'd probably fucking read. And if it had a picture of an English
[51:14.250 --> 51:18.170]  bulldog on it, I probably wouldn't put it in my hair. Oh, okay. Here's, here's probably what
[51:18.170 --> 51:23.370]  happened. You said, uh, yeah, don't use the orange one. Use the other one. I avoided the orange one.
[51:23.450 --> 51:26.930]  The other one was pet shampoo. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened because there was
[51:26.930 --> 51:31.430]  no mention of pet at any point. It never came out of your mouth. Hey, be careful of the dog shampoo.
[51:31.870 --> 51:36.030]  You need to give a warning for that. I feel like you would just naturally know to avoid the dog
[51:36.030 --> 51:41.470]  shampoo. I don't know. If you were, if you're having someone over Andrew and you had two
[51:41.470 --> 51:45.610]  shampoos, one was for, you know, like a parrot. Wouldn't you warn them about that? Wait, a parrot?
[51:45.770 --> 51:49.530]  A parrot shampoo? Do parrots need shampoos? I don't know. I'm just trying to think of something
[51:49.530 --> 51:53.870]  that you wouldn't want to put on your own head. Sure. I mean, am I? Well, why wouldn't I? Why
[51:53.870 --> 51:59.590]  can't I use the parrot shampoo? What is the difference between the human shampoo? Yeah,
[51:59.590 --> 52:05.950]  I mean, dogs have hair. Gavin's have hair. They both got to get clean. Soap is soap, right? Yeah,
[52:05.950 --> 52:10.450]  but I guess there's a reason that L'Oreal aren't making dog shampoo. Is that what it looked like,
[52:10.510 --> 52:14.510]  Gavin? Because if that's what it looked like, you've no excuse. No, it didn't look like that.
[52:14.570 --> 52:18.490]  There was no picture of a dog on it. I like the idea of you just reading oatmeal shampoo and
[52:18.490 --> 52:22.910]  being like, that's odd. We're going to go with this. I like to believe that I found the only
[52:22.910 --> 52:29.130]  container of fucking dog shampoo that doesn't have a dog on it. Bullshit. It was like, it may
[52:29.130 --> 52:33.350]  have had like a silhouette or something that was small, but I remember it was a white bottle with
[52:33.350 --> 52:38.850]  like a maroon top. No, it's the poster pictures of giant dogs on the front of the shampoo. It was
[52:39.330 --> 52:43.450]  silhouetted. It was suggested for dogs. They don't want to be too overt with the messaging.
[52:43.790 --> 52:48.010]  But I tell you something. Oh, was that it? No, that's still got a big dog on it. You mean the
[52:48.010 --> 52:51.970]  one with the picture of a fucking dog on it? No, they're getting smaller. The giant Dalmatian
[52:51.970 --> 52:56.490]  right there. They're getting smaller. I tell you what though, I sure as shit didn't have fleas on
[52:56.490 --> 53:09.050]  my first two days in the country. Audience, if you can find a dog shampoo in your house that
[53:09.050 --> 53:13.550]  doesn't have a picture of a dog on it, please send it to us. No, it can have a picture of a dog, but I'm
[53:13.550 --> 53:17.890]  telling you, if the word shampoo is bigger than the picture of the dog, I'm just gonna see that
[53:17.890 --> 53:24.050]  and stop reading. If it's not like blindingly dog shampoo, I don't know who would...
[53:24.050 --> 53:30.710]  Who studies a shampoo? That's, I mean, a fair point, but I feel like so many of these bottles
[53:30.710 --> 53:35.890]  I would look at and go, this isn't, this isn't correct. This is, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm...
[53:39.490 --> 53:46.130]  Maybe we're focusing this in the wrong... at the wrong person. Dog shampoo industry, if you're
[53:46.130 --> 53:52.390]  listening to this podcast, maybe, maybe be a little more overt with your advertising. Maybe
[53:52.950 --> 53:59.630]  make the dog, maybe go into Photoshop and add the picture of your dog shampoo, the design, and
[53:59.630 --> 54:06.130]  click on the dog and then make it 30% bigger. And then make it 10% bigger for Gavin. And then
[54:06.130 --> 54:12.910]  make the word dog at least 20 points bigger. I'm gonna google how does pet shampoo differ
[54:12.910 --> 54:17.750]  from human shampoo. Yeah, I'm curious. Can I use pet shampoo? Different amount of sulfates, pH levels,
[54:17.750 --> 54:24.750]  and cost. Okay, I'm gonna say right now. Is it cheaper? Gavin, if that, if that bottle of
[54:25.430 --> 54:30.730]  Tropiclean Oatmeal and Tea Tree Pet Shampoo is the one in my bathroom, I can see how you would
[54:30.730 --> 54:35.430]  have fallen for it. That is a tiny, tiny picture of a dog. The what, the tea one? Yeah. I think
[54:35.430 --> 54:41.460]  that's, I think it might be something like that. It's tinier, the dog is tinier than the word,
[54:41.460 --> 54:49.280]  the and sign. Yeah, I will say if it is that, okay, great. I will also say it's been 10 minutes
[54:49.280 --> 54:54.620]  of this conversation, and that's the first time we found one that's even close to passable as
[54:54.620 --> 54:59.160]  maybe this is people shampoo. I also would look at that bottle and think it's probably also
[54:59.160 --> 55:06.200]  sunscreen. Yeah, maybe. How does, I think you are setting me up for failure whether you knew it or
[55:06.200 --> 55:11.800]  not. Or it could be, it could be, it could be skin cream too. It could just be like lotion.
[55:12.180 --> 55:17.360]  That is a deceptive bottle. I just remember having to use a lot of it to get it to work.
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.380]  That one, see, that wouldn't be acceptable. I think it was definitely a white or a cream
[55:24.900 --> 55:29.480]  bottle mainly. Can a human use dog shampoo? I mean, obviously you did, but like, is there a
[55:29.480 --> 55:34.420]  danger to it? Is there a negative? Different, different pH levels and whatnot. Yeah, I mean,
[55:34.420 --> 55:38.920]  I feel like it did the trick. Like it, it definitely took the, the travel out of my hair.
[55:39.300 --> 55:44.300]  I just, now I'll be honest with you. That looks like, that looks familiar to me. That's probably
[55:44.300 --> 55:50.440]  the dog shampoo I would have used. Now that clearly has a horse, a dog, and a cat. There's
[55:50.440 --> 55:58.040]  more animals. And that looks like, that looks like some shit I would have bought. I don't recognize
[55:58.040 --> 56:02.620]  any of those other dog shampoo brands, but that one, that one, that one looks the most like
[56:02.620 --> 56:07.980]  medicine though. Yeah. Not one person. Eric's right. There's not one, there's not one silhouette
[56:07.980 --> 56:13.600]  of a person. I will give you this Gavin. All three of those animals are silhouetted on the,
[56:13.660 --> 56:19.620]  on the shampoo bottle, but they are very, that is very clearly a horse. What's the person? How many,
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.000]  how many of your shampoos have people on it? All of them. You got a picture of a human on
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.380]  your shampoo? No, no, no, no. I have a bottle of shampoo on my desk. No, that's true. That's true.
[56:30.380 --> 56:37.020]  No, no person. Goat milk shampoo. Wait, I wanted to, I wanted to use an example of something that
[56:37.020 --> 56:41.520]  has an animal, but it's not for the animal. I believe this is goat milk shampoo, but it's not
[56:41.520 --> 56:45.580]  shampoo for goats. Ah, so she's got pictures of goats all over it, but you wouldn't want to use
[56:45.580 --> 56:55.740]  it on a goat. Yeah, different pH levels. This is my shampoo. Here's my shampoo. I don't think that
[56:55.740 --> 57:00.500]  I would be confused. This is shampoo I have in my bathroom right now. You want me to click a link?
[57:01.020 --> 57:06.080]  I guess so. It just says the word surf on it. Yeah, there's no. Yeah. Yeah, it says surf, and then it
[57:06.080 --> 57:13.380]  says, it says, uh, foam wash shampoo, shampooing for buoyant body and soft sea breezy texture.
[57:13.660 --> 57:17.780]  And then it says it in other languages too, but at no point does it say anything about it being
[57:17.780 --> 57:25.200]  for a dog. $27? Jeez. Well, I don't buy it. It's, I get, my girlfriend owns a hair salon. Oh,
[57:25.200 --> 57:31.160]  fair play. That's like 10 times the price of like a head and shoulders. I get like two bottles of
[57:31.160 --> 57:36.680]  dog shampoo at that price. Andrew, what shampoo are you rocking? I, it's a, I don't know. It's a
[57:36.680 --> 57:40.820]  bumble and bumble thing, I guess. I don't know. I just kind of grab shampoos. I don't put a lot of
[57:40.820 --> 57:45.640]  thought into it. I might try a dog shampoo. The variety we've, we selected. Bumble and bumble is
[57:45.640 --> 57:50.000]  what I use. Are you, do you and I use the same shampoo? No, I use a different type. I'm using the,
[57:50.000 --> 57:56.120]  the, the gentle, the BB gentle shampoo, I guess. Oh, are you serious? Emily uses that, I think.
[57:56.200 --> 58:01.640]  Uh, yeah. It's on my desk. Um, do you find most shampoo too rough for your hair? Uh, no,
[58:01.660 --> 58:05.620]  I've never really made any observation about shampoo. Geoff, I think I fucked with your
[58:05.620 --> 58:11.860]  shampoo somehow, but I don't remember what it was. Okay. I don't, I just, I'd love to hear that.
[58:11.940 --> 58:15.780]  What does that mean? Like you messed with it or you've used it? Yeah, I know I messed with it
[58:15.780 --> 58:21.140]  in some way or I was, yeah, I was in or what happened with that? That definitely happened.
[58:21.520 --> 58:25.440]  What do you mean? Well, there's something with Millie and I were the shampoo. We talked about
[58:25.440 --> 58:30.260]  messing with your shampoo, I think. Did you replace it with pet shampoo? I don't remember
[58:30.260 --> 58:33.840]  what it was. This was a long time ago. I completely forgot about this, but I think
[58:33.840 --> 58:38.720]  something happened to your shampoo at some point. Really? What was it? I don't remember. I just
[58:38.720 --> 58:41.800]  remember there was a conversation about doing something to your shampoo. I don't remember
[58:41.800 --> 58:45.100]  what it was. I forgot all about it until I saw your photo of the shampoo. I was like,
[58:45.100 --> 58:51.100]  that's a familiar bottle. How many years ago was this? Uh, maybe like two? A year and a half,
[58:51.200 --> 58:55.480]  maybe? So you're probably a few bottles on from that. Yeah, you're, it's not currently in the
[58:55.480 --> 58:59.040]  rotation. You would have used the bottle by now. Maybe nothing happened. What did you do to my
[58:59.040 --> 59:04.520]  shampoo? I don't know. I wish I did, but there was some talk about doing something. What is that?
[59:04.520 --> 59:10.120]  Are you fucking with me right now? No, I'm not. There is a conversation about your shampoo and
[59:10.120 --> 59:14.860]  doing something to it. I just don't remember what that was. You son of a bitch. Oh,
[59:14.860 --> 59:18.200]  I mean, it wasn't my idea. I don't think I feel like it was presented to me. And then
[59:18.200 --> 59:22.680]  a conversation happened about the options that could be used. How do you remember nothing of
[59:22.680 --> 59:28.400]  importance about it? Yeah, I know it's, it's odd. I remember discussing it. I don't remember if it
[59:28.400 --> 59:33.640]  happened because I wasn't there. I didn't physically do this, but yeah, I think, I think
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.240]  I fucked with your shampoo. I would love it if you would sit down and figure out what you did.
[59:38.360 --> 59:42.280]  I'll think about it. I'd love to know how I was fucked with. Next episode. If it happened,
[59:42.700 --> 59:49.380]  I'll, uh, I'll figure it out. I'll look into that. I, my least favorite development in this podcast
[59:49.380 --> 59:55.560]  is when the Andrew Panton is the portion when, I'm sorry, Raymond, uh, presents, uh, some scenario
[59:55.560 --> 01:00:01.160]  where he may be fucking with me or not. And I'm left to try to, to try to figure it out for a
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.720]  week or two or three. I'll, uh, I dunno, a giant pink porta potty that may or may not show up in
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.160]  my house every day of my life that I have to, every day I go to bed and I think today I dodged
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.040]  the porta potty. Thank Christ. Now I'm going to have to, every day I'm going to take a shower and
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.100]  think like, what did Andrew do to my shampoo? And has he done it again? No, it's a one-time thing.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:25.200]  I, I just, I, I asked Millie. I don't know. I'll get back to you. I don't, I don't. Thanks. I'm
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:34.390]  not sure. You okay, Geoff? Yeah, I'm just thinking about buying new shampoo now. Oh, no, you don't
[01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:38.950]  need to buy new shampoo. I think we're supposed to close the show, Geoff. This is, this is your job.
[01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:43.150]  It's what you do. All right, well, thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:47.170]  Uh, I'll be honest with you. I don't know what we talked about today. What, what did we cover?
[01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:52.210]  What was the point of today? Can I talk about a F*** Face that we did to ourselves? I tried. I did
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:56.370]  my best to point us in the right direction. No, no, no, hold on a second. Hold on a second here
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.430]  because I'm not sure we have a full show yet. Andrew, let's see what you've got. No, this is,
[01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:05.210]  this is a small thing. We might have a ZimmerZone shirt that might be releasing as the same time as
[01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:09.690]  this episode. I tried to bring it up. You mean on St. Patrick's Day? Yeah, well, I don't know.
[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:13.650]  We're talking about, I asked, they asked when do we want to release the ZimmerZone shirt and I
[01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:17.930]  asked what you guys thought. Haven't heard. We made a small modification to the, the image,
[01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:23.350]  if I remember correctly. Uh, I, I asked on our behalf for that change. I don't know if that's
[01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:28.330]  going to happen, but uh, what is it out yet? Do we think it's out yet? Is the shirt out yet?
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.570]  Yeah, if it is, it'll be on our Instagram. I'm going to be optimistic and say yes.
[01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.910]  And if they want to find that Instagram, where can they find it?
[01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:40.890]  On Instagram? What a stupid question. Jesus Christ. Do you not link to Instagram?
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:45.730]  And where do you go on description, Eric? I do, but I want to know, I want to know you
[01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:48.670]  can say it out loud and then people hear it and then they go, Oh, I'll go check it out right now.
[01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:53.210]  Do you, do you know the answer? F*** Facepod. Thank you. What I'm trying,
[01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:58.430]  I'm trying to get you, the host, to say the name because it holds more weight than when I,
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:04.610]  some dipshit, say it. The, you mean some dipshit, the producer, producer Eric?
[01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:08.790]  Yeah. Dude, you need, you need to have, you need to believe in yourself a little bit more,
[01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:11.630]  Eric. You need to work on yourself. Guys, we might have, we might have
[01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:17.310]  10 to $15 worth of budget next week. I'm excited. I can get a bottle of dog shampoo. This is great.
[01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:24.790]  Thanks for listening to F*** Face. If you haven't heard about it,
[01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:31.370]  not only are we a podcast, we're also an Instagram. And you can find our stuff on that Instagram. And
[01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:35.210]  Eric wants you to know about that. He even said the name of it earlier. I don't want to step on
[01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:39.450]  him, so I won't say it again. But if you didn't catch it, rewind a few minutes till Eric's talking.
[01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:44.570]  He'll, I promise you, he says it clearly. And then you can then from that point on,
[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.590]  you can continue till you catch up. And then this is all new from this point on,
[01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:51.410]  or you can just fast forward back to this point right here or a few seconds back so you don't
[01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:55.330]  miss anything. And then continue on with the end of the episode, which is what this is.
[01:02:55.670 --> 01:03:01.370]  Hopefully, you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you. And if so, it would be really
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:07.190]  swell if you would tell a friend or a family member or a coworker or an enemy or some sort
[01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:12.650]  of a despot about our podcast and recommend that they listen to it. Maybe listen to one,
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:16.710]  maybe listen to 100 episodes, maybe listen to the same episode 100 times. I don't tell you
[01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.710]  how to enjoy your content, but I do want you to enjoy it. And I want you to tell other people
[01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:25.810]  to enjoy it, too, if that's your jam. If not, that's cool. We also like reviews and rates and
[01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:29.850]  all those things. There's stars you can click. There's words you can use to tell other people
[01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:35.390]  in a comment about how much you like the show, or you can review it like Eugene Siskel himself
[01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:41.250]  and tell the world all about the two thumbs up you gave F*** Face. And that's it for me.
[01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.970]  Gavin and Andrew, would you like to finish out the episode?
[01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:50.310]  I peeled an orange and ate it within your intro. I just ate an entire orange. I peeled it and ate
[01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:54.930]  it. I think we're good. How big was it? Wait, wait, how big was this orange? It's a tangerine
[01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:59.190]  orange. I just ate the whole thing in one bite. Yeah, I threw it all in my mouth because I was
[01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:05.770]  trying to be Geoff on the outro. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Don't go anywhere. Do not go anywhere.
[01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:12.150]  Do not go anywhere. I'll be right back. It somehow didn't end. Wow, that might be the
[01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:17.370]  most end we've ever had without ending. That was over. Well, we did three intros,
[01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:23.890]  so we might as well do two outros. I'm peeling another orange, but I don't I don't think I'm
[01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:29.210]  back. Hold on. Hold on. I'm preparing something. So you're going to peel and eat in one bite?
[01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:32.430]  No. All right. Well, here's I'm going to do it with a picture of my hand.
[01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.790]  OK, see a mouse and my hand. Am I eating another orange?
[01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:40.890]  No. I just want to know what that means when you say you ate an orange. So here's what I'm
[01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:45.630]  going to do. I'm going to send. Oh, that's a bad photo of an orange. That's what that's a bad.
[01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:51.930]  Blurry. I don't take good photos. OK, one more. No, you don't. You've covered. All right,
[01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:56.010]  here we go. It's because he's hammering the take picture button like before the app is open.
[01:04:56.170 --> 01:05:00.530]  Is the tangerine not an established size for an orange? I feel like we all know. It's not an
[01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.950]  orange. If it's tangerine, it's not an orange. It's not an orange. It's tangerine. And you said
[01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:09.050]  orange. So that's why it confused me here. What is a tangerine? Like clementine, satsuma, tangerine.
[01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.530]  None of them are oranges. Wait, what does that mean? It means they're not they're not an orange.
[01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:21.030]  Well, what is this? Since I can't ever get since I can't ever. Nick, I'm sorry. I don't have.
[01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:25.710]  I don't have your phone number. I'm just going to send this is an orange is a big fruit.
[01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:33.190]  I texted you guys a photo, OK? Oh, you have it in that photo are two oranges. Which size would
[01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:37.350]  you say is approximate to what you? I apparently don't even have an orange. I thought it was like
[01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.990]  apples. It was like different types of names for apples. I thought this was an orange.
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:47.230]  Why is your hand in the picture? To give you a reference to size. But I put my hand. I put my
[01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:53.150]  hand and the mouse in for size. You put your hand behind it. Yeah, you can see the plastic stuff
[01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:57.790]  that's back there. What is that? Oh, that is a piece of plastic that I from the bag that I ripped
[01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:02.510]  the orange out of. You had to get it really quickly. I was tearing it open like a raccoon.
[01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:06.750]  Yeah, I was running through the groceries. So, Andrew, point to an orange. Is it the one on
[01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:10.470]  the left? It's the one on the left. Yeah, it's the one on the left. It's the closer one. That's
[01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:15.670]  that's like a little cutie. That's a yeah, but it's an orange. That's still an orange on the
[01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:20.410]  right. God damn it. I couldn't put an entire. I don't think I could do that in my mouth at one
[01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:25.650]  time. That's even that's what was so mystifying to Gavin and I. I guess I could try. I mean,
[01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:30.050]  are they all oranges that we've just given different? Like, I guess there's a blood orange.
[01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.490]  No, that's different. That's what I'm saying. Is a tangerine, a clementine, an orange?
[01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:37.530]  A tangerine is a Mandarin orange, if that's what you're asking. Yeah, it's an orange. It's
[01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:41.870]  a type of orange. All right. Well, I just want to know what size. So you ate so you ate a tiny
[01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:48.130]  orange. That's not nearly as impressive as you eating an orange. It was more of a point of how
[01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:53.210]  long that outro was, which didn't end up even being an outro. The one that we're still doing, you
[01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:58.950]  could have eaten two regular oranges by now. How many regular oranges should you be able to eat in
[01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:06.910]  one standard length outro? What? I want to know if he's like, I want to know. I want to know how
[01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:15.340]  long now. Did he stop? Did he? What happened to his? I don't know what he did. He disappeared.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:20.600]  I don't know. No, I was just wondering if you were trying to. Yeah, Geoff was Geoff was yelling and
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.680]  then stopped yelling. Well, I was I was going to say for the confusion, if tangerine and Mandarin
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.100]  and Satsuma are oranges, then what's an orange? That's a great question. Like what is the regular
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:37.420]  orange that you juice? That's like a juice of tangerine because it's not like a Granny Smith
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:43.760]  and then a Bramley and then a Braeburn and then an apple. They're all apples. Right. Right. Well,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.920]  if you want to find out the answer to that question and more, tune in to the next episode
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:54.580]  of Face, which is a great outro. And that's I think Eric might have answered my question.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.640]  I was trying to now we're now we're using oranges as a unit of measurement now that we've landed
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:06.400]  on the size of an orange. Andrew said that my intro was long enough to peel and eat one small
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.880]  orange of tangelo or Satsuma side. So I'm trying to figure I was just trying to determine what and
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.540]  what like in in orange time, what an appropriate length is. Is it like half an orange? Is it like
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:21.260]  you just appeal and then I should be done before you could even get the orange in your mouth?
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.740]  Should you be able to fully peel an orange in my outro?
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.200]  Is that too long? I don't know. I'm just trying to get a sense.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.700]  I'm going to this is my last orange. So that orange.
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.340]  Have you started it yet?
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.820]  He's already he's already eating. Can you read? Can you unpeel it and then repeal it?
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:38.300]  No.
