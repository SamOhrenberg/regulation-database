[00:05.620 --> 00:06.860]  how can you not feel centered?
[00:07.080 --> 00:08.980]  But did you know you can get that vibe anywhere?
[00:09.280 --> 00:12.320]  That's because whether after work, at barbecues or at a bar,

[01:01.120 --> 01:01.640]  Hello!
[01:03.560 --> 01:04.660]  Wow, man.
[01:04.860 --> 01:06.480]  Why do you do that every time?
[01:06.520 --> 01:08.600]  You hate yourself when you go overly enthusiastic.
[01:08.960 --> 01:12.940]  Geoff wants to always land on like a 6 out of 10 for enthusiasm,
[01:13.180 --> 01:14.420]  but that was 11.
[01:14.740 --> 01:16.280]  I don't know why you overshot so far.
[01:16.380 --> 01:19.840]  Yeah, he opens 11 and then he hates himself for it,
[01:19.900 --> 01:21.120]  and then he goes down.
[01:21.260 --> 01:23.460]  Yeah, at least he didn't do the whole thing this time.
[01:23.520 --> 01:24.540]  He stopped after hello.
[01:24.900 --> 01:26.100]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[01:26.640 --> 01:28.400]  One of you guys is gonna do the intro this week.
[01:28.660 --> 01:29.220]  I'm taking a break.
[01:30.800 --> 01:31.520]  Okay, interesting.
[01:31.600 --> 01:32.240]  Who's gonna do it?
[01:32.500 --> 01:33.700]  I nominate Gavin.
[01:33.760 --> 01:34.340]  You wanna do a vote?
[01:34.740 --> 01:35.600]  Oh, you do a vote.
[01:35.900 --> 01:36.700]  I like a good vote.
[01:36.980 --> 01:37.580]  How about this?
[01:37.580 --> 01:39.360]  I don't like the vote.
[01:39.720 --> 01:41.360]  The vote's gonna go sideways.
[01:41.780 --> 01:42.740]  How about this?
[01:43.480 --> 01:44.480]  You can't vote me.
[01:44.620 --> 01:45.560]  It's either of you.
[01:45.820 --> 01:46.940]  I'm abstaining.
[01:47.080 --> 01:47.720]  I vote Geoff.
[01:47.780 --> 01:49.840]  What if we do the number thing?
[01:50.140 --> 01:53.160]  Eric can pick a number and you guys try to get closest to it.
[01:53.180 --> 01:55.160]  This seems way too complicated for us to just do the intro.
[01:55.180 --> 01:55.300]  Okay, I got it.
[01:55.320 --> 01:55.840]  I picked the number.
[01:55.940 --> 01:56.160]  Go ahead.
[01:56.360 --> 01:56.660]  Give me...
[01:56.660 --> 01:57.240]  Go ahead and say a number.
[01:57.520 --> 01:58.580]  What's the range?
[01:58.820 --> 01:59.300]  1 to 100.
[01:59.540 --> 01:59.980]  Give me a number.
[02:00.060 --> 02:00.220]  Okay.
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.500]  No, I'm not gonna say it.
[02:01.580 --> 02:02.240]  Gavin, you go ahead.
[02:02.320 --> 02:02.640]  You go first.
[02:02.860 --> 02:04.300]  You gotta mute.
[02:04.540 --> 02:05.100]  You gotta deafen.
[02:05.620 --> 02:06.640]  Why do I have to deafen?
[02:06.640 --> 02:08.120]  We're going back and forth on numbers.
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.780]  Welcome to F*** Face, the podcast where Geoff, Gavin, and Andrew get into wacky hijinks and
[02:12.780 --> 02:13.800]  talk about it weekly.
[02:14.140 --> 02:15.100]  Are you new to the show?
[02:15.360 --> 02:17.180]  You have a lot of catching up to do.
[02:17.240 --> 02:18.460]  Welcome to the Zimmer zone.
[02:18.640 --> 02:20.000]  Did you know Andrew didn't eat a pencil?
[02:20.420 --> 02:22.140]  Gavin washed his hair with dog shampoo.
[02:22.540 --> 02:25.160]  This and more on today's episode of F*** Face.
[02:25.280 --> 02:26.220]  So here's what happened, right?
[02:26.260 --> 02:29.020]  I bought this jacket and it had the alarm thing still in it.
[02:29.080 --> 02:32.780]  Didn't realize, walked out, probably set the alarm off, got home, it was still in there.
[02:32.900 --> 02:34.620]  I thought, I could probably cut this out.
[02:34.620 --> 02:36.120]  But then I thought, I'll leave it in.
[02:36.140 --> 02:37.640]  I'll see what happens out in the world.
[02:38.840 --> 02:46.260]  Probably of the 400 theft alarms I set off in various shops around England, it was investigated
[02:46.260 --> 02:48.700]  maybe three times.
[02:49.680 --> 02:54.820]  And every time I just had to say, oh, it's like in this jacket and they'd go, okay.
[02:55.420 --> 02:58.300]  At no point was a bag that I was holding ever checked.
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.140]  The worst time was at, I think I went to Alton Towers, which is a theme park.
[03:04.980 --> 03:05.700]  In England.
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.480]  And it set off what I thought was a metal detector, but it happened to also be set off
[03:10.480 --> 03:10.980]  by that thing.
[03:11.160 --> 03:12.960]  They came over, some police were there.
[03:13.060 --> 03:13.860]  They were like, what are you doing?
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.260]  I was like, I just got it in my jacket.
[03:15.360 --> 03:15.820]  And they're like, all right.
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.300]  It was a very inconvenient, but because I'd never actually stolen anything, it became
[03:21.300 --> 03:26.580]  funny because my friends were always annoyed and they never wanted to go shopping with
[03:26.580 --> 03:29.260]  me, which was great because I don't really like going shopping.
[03:29.500 --> 03:31.300]  Anyway, that's about it really.
[03:31.300 --> 03:37.020]  Just over the course of a couple of years, testing all of the alarms around England.
[03:37.420 --> 03:41.460]  Did you ever come up with a strategy to deal with this?
[03:41.600 --> 03:44.920]  To avoid being, well, I guess it happens so rarely, but did you ever adjust your approach
[03:44.920 --> 03:45.920]  when entering stores?
[03:46.240 --> 03:47.660]  What, like trying to not set them off?
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.280]  Like testing?
[03:48.520 --> 03:49.040]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:49.120 --> 03:49.360]  Okay.
[03:49.480 --> 03:51.760]  So I forgot that this had happened to me.
[03:51.840 --> 03:53.040]  I had the same experience.
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.660]  I could never figure out what was triggering it, but I had one combination of clothing
[03:57.660 --> 04:01.540]  that would set off an alarm every time I'd go into stores.
[04:02.020 --> 04:02.400]  A combination?
[04:02.940 --> 04:04.560]  Yeah, like I couldn't figure out what it was.
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.300]  I like, I think it may have been the underwear, but like it would happen frequently.
[04:08.940 --> 04:09.480]  I don't know.
[04:09.760 --> 04:12.420]  I never figured out what piece was doing it.
[04:12.680 --> 04:18.180]  This thing in my jacket was like a coaster sized disc and I can't imagine having one of
[04:18.180 --> 04:20.460]  those in underwear and being able to sit down on it.
[04:20.520 --> 04:22.220]  No, no, it wasn't like a coaster.
[04:22.460 --> 04:26.060]  It was like I woke up and this was like a superpower I gained overnight.
[04:26.060 --> 04:27.760]  Like it just suddenly started happening.
[04:27.920 --> 04:29.180]  How old are you when this happened?
[04:29.480 --> 04:33.060]  Oh, probably 16, maybe 17.
[04:33.340 --> 04:33.640]  Okay.
[04:33.740 --> 04:34.160]  In that range.
[04:34.300 --> 04:37.200]  I have some questions for the coaster sized disc when we're past that.
[04:37.300 --> 04:38.620]  But let's talk about this right now.
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.540]  How did you like?
[04:39.620 --> 04:40.680]  What was the culmination?
[04:40.780 --> 04:44.360]  I was well, it's just like short, like what items of clothing did I have on?
[04:44.540 --> 04:45.580]  Or like how did it?
[04:45.580 --> 04:45.840]  What did it?
[04:45.860 --> 04:47.180]  What did it lead up to?
[04:47.380 --> 04:48.640]  Did it just like stop one day?
[04:48.980 --> 04:52.260]  Yeah, it was just like one day I noticed the alarm went off and I was like,
[04:52.300 --> 04:53.060]  huh, that was weird.
[04:53.100 --> 04:55.080]  And then it happened like four more times in a row.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.600]  And I thought that's probably not a coincidence.
[04:57.060 --> 04:58.100]  This is probably me.
[04:58.360 --> 05:00.300]  And then every time I'd go into that store,
[05:00.740 --> 05:03.640]  the alarm would go off and I was wearing some piece of clothing.
[05:03.780 --> 05:03.980]  I don't know.
[05:03.980 --> 05:05.480]  So it's just one store.
[05:05.840 --> 05:08.420]  Yeah, it was mainly one stores where I remember it.
[05:08.480 --> 05:09.020]  Yeah, it was weird.
[05:09.060 --> 05:11.180]  It was like a London drug site, but it was in both of them.
[05:11.300 --> 05:12.660]  But then it just stopped all at once.
[05:12.660 --> 05:14.060]  Like just suddenly it didn't go off anymore.
[05:14.140 --> 05:14.960]  Or did you know?
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.620]  I think I threw away the underwear and then it stopped.
[05:17.680 --> 05:20.560]  But I can't like I don't understand why the underwear would have been the cause.
[05:20.940 --> 05:23.600]  I don't see how a combination is in effect.
[05:23.880 --> 05:24.120]  Yeah.
[05:24.120 --> 05:28.120]  Did you always wear the same pair of underwear with the same socks or something?
[05:28.220 --> 05:30.000]  And that's why you couldn't narrow it down?
[05:30.480 --> 05:31.880]  Well, yeah, I'm not like a socks guy.
[05:31.900 --> 05:36.680]  I don't have a large range of outfits and I would buy multiples of the same thing.
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.220]  You're not a socks guy.
[05:40.300 --> 05:40.560]  What?
[05:40.840 --> 05:42.080]  Can you kill?
[05:42.160 --> 05:42.380]  All right.
[05:42.480 --> 05:43.840]  Can we talk about that for a second?
[05:44.220 --> 05:44.380]  Sure.
[05:44.440 --> 05:44.660]  Go ahead.
[05:44.860 --> 05:45.540]  What does that mean?
[05:45.560 --> 05:47.800]  When you say I'm not a sock guy, what does it explain?
[05:48.040 --> 05:48.700]  Elaborate, please.
[05:48.880 --> 05:49.740]  I own socks.
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.140]  I don't often wear them unless I'm going to somebody's house.
[05:53.140 --> 05:54.960]  I'm going to someone's house, then I'll wear them.
[05:55.200 --> 05:55.300]  Okay.
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.320]  All right.
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.860]  So I'm going to take us through a scenario.
[05:59.140 --> 06:00.260]  I just want to understand this.
[06:00.460 --> 06:00.600]  Yeah.
[06:00.660 --> 06:01.420]  So you get up.
[06:01.580 --> 06:03.600]  You're moving about your house barefoot probably or whatever.
[06:03.680 --> 06:04.040]  That's fine.
[06:04.100 --> 06:04.440]  That's cool.
[06:05.140 --> 06:06.200]  You decide you're going to leave.
[06:06.320 --> 06:06.980]  It's Tuesday.
[06:07.420 --> 06:09.640]  You're going to leave your house to go.
[06:10.180 --> 06:12.760]  By the way, we are assuming this is in a non-pandemic world.
[06:12.980 --> 06:13.540]  This is like...
[06:13.540 --> 06:13.700]  Yep.
[06:13.940 --> 06:16.000]  Pandemic never happened or it was before the whatever.
[06:16.000 --> 06:24.020]  So you're going to go to the convenience store to buy a lottery ticket.
[06:24.280 --> 06:28.740]  And then you were going to go to the movies and McDonald's to get some food and come home.
[06:29.120 --> 06:35.540]  You would put closed-toed shoes on, like a pair of Nikes with no socks.
[06:35.740 --> 06:35.940]  Yeah.
[06:36.200 --> 06:37.640]  And then go do all of those things.
[06:37.840 --> 06:41.620]  And then come home and then take it off and go about your day barefoot.
[06:42.220 --> 06:45.180]  However, if it's a Wednesday and you are going to go do...
[06:45.700 --> 06:46.860]  You're going to go to the grocery store.
[06:46.940 --> 06:51.540]  But then you're also going to swing by Gavin's house to help him set up his Xbox
[06:51.540 --> 06:55.380]  because he's too stupid to understand how to close his gnat or how to open his gnat up.
[06:55.500 --> 06:56.420]  And he's having all kinds of...
[06:56.420 --> 06:57.560]  And you try to do it over the phone.
[06:58.120 --> 07:00.120]  And then you even try to do it over a Zoom call.
[07:00.240 --> 07:02.300]  And it's just pointless because Gavin is...
[07:02.300 --> 07:03.960]  He's just not there mentally.
[07:04.140 --> 07:07.300]  And so you're going to go over to Gavin's house and you're going to help him open up his gnat,
[07:07.400 --> 07:08.360]  which is the easiest thing in the world.
[07:08.460 --> 07:11.500]  Anyway, so you would put socks on for that purpose.
[07:11.640 --> 07:13.000]  Now, is that correct?
[07:13.400 --> 07:13.640]  Yes.
[07:13.960 --> 07:15.000]  Is that for a smell?
[07:15.180 --> 07:15.740]  Reason?
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.260]  Or is that because if you're afraid you're going to take your shoes off at Gavin's house,
[07:20.380 --> 07:22.060]  you don't want to walk around Gavin's house barefoot?
[07:22.300 --> 07:25.520]  Yeah, I'm assuming if I'm going to someone's home, I'll take my shoes off.
[07:25.600 --> 07:28.400]  And I feel like going barefoot in another person's home is rude.
[07:28.600 --> 07:29.100]  I would agree.
[07:29.220 --> 07:36.120]  I would also say that a sock has a job that it does pretty well in that it's the cleanable part.
[07:36.480 --> 07:38.020]  You can easily wash a sock.
[07:38.080 --> 07:41.400]  And as it soaks up, you know, the day's worth of foot sweat,
[07:41.400 --> 07:46.140]  it's not going to sit there overnight for months on end in an unwashed shoe.
[07:46.240 --> 07:47.700]  You just swap the sock.
[07:47.860 --> 07:51.140]  You maintain a nice smelling shoe for much longer.
[07:51.260 --> 07:56.300]  Listen, Gav, there's a whole lot to dive into in terms of how disgusting this is.
[07:56.380 --> 07:58.340]  I just wanted to get through the facts first, so we understood.
[07:58.940 --> 08:05.340]  Obviously, Andrew, as an adult male human being who sweats and goes about
[08:05.340 --> 08:10.240]  the rigors of being a human being, he must have stinky fucking feet.
[08:10.240 --> 08:12.340]  The sock hides the stink.
[08:12.440 --> 08:12.740]  Oh, yeah.
[08:13.040 --> 08:13.960]  The sock absorbs the stink.
[08:14.080 --> 08:16.460]  So you must have... and stinky feet are sour.
[08:16.840 --> 08:17.640]  They're gross.
[08:18.040 --> 08:18.900]  It's a bad one.
[08:19.540 --> 08:19.660]  Sour?
[08:21.340 --> 08:21.740]  Yeah.
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.820]  You ever smell like a sour, stinky foot?
[08:23.940 --> 08:27.860]  Like somebody ran around all day long and sweated in their fucking shoe.
[08:28.240 --> 08:28.980]  And they're in their Nikes.
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.260]  Oh, it's the worst smell.
[08:30.320 --> 08:32.220]  Geoff, I'm not out here smelling feet, okay?
[08:32.340 --> 08:33.920]  I don't have my fucking nose in shoes.
[08:34.520 --> 08:37.660]  Unfortunately, for those of us who wear socks diligently,
[08:37.660 --> 08:43.100]  we don't always have a choice because we're not subjected to stinky feet in our homes,
[08:43.100 --> 08:48.200]  so we don't have the opportunity to develop any natural immunities to it.
[08:48.320 --> 08:50.680]  So when I go out on the street, if I go to the grocery store or whatever,
[08:50.840 --> 08:52.520]  and somebody's got stinky feet out,
[08:52.660 --> 08:56.980]  I'm going to notice it even more than, say, you would because you live in filth and stinky feet.
[08:57.040 --> 09:01.100]  I also feel like a shoe alone doesn't absorb great.
[09:01.260 --> 09:05.400]  I don't ever wear a shoe without a sock on because, to me, I don't like the feel.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.860]  But I can imagine after a hot, you know, sweaty Texas day,
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.900]  there might be some slush in the shoe.
[09:11.080 --> 09:12.040]  How bad can it get?
[09:12.360 --> 09:12.660]  Pretty bad.
[09:13.060 --> 09:13.860]  I don't live in Texas.
[09:14.140 --> 09:16.640]  I don't know, like, the fucking Texas scenario does nothing to me.
[09:16.740 --> 09:17.920]  I live in a pretty cold place.
[09:18.240 --> 09:18.780]  Yeah, I have.
[09:18.880 --> 09:19.800]  Oh, I guess I have.
[09:19.960 --> 09:20.800]  Do you pop socks on?
[09:21.360 --> 09:22.500]  Let me think, yeah.
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.160]  Do I put socks on... do I put socks on in Texas?
[09:26.700 --> 09:28.360]  I... yeah, I think I do.
[09:28.580 --> 09:31.160]  Yeah, I'm a socks guy on the road, I guess, depending on climate.
[09:31.160 --> 09:32.140]  Socks on the road.
[09:32.140 --> 09:35.240]  Well, let me, let me, let me ask you another question.
[09:35.540 --> 09:35.980]  Either of you.
[09:36.240 --> 09:41.380]  Do either of you know what the grossest thing on the planet Earth is?
[09:42.640 --> 09:45.800]  Like a bodily fluid that is collected in invisible...
[09:45.800 --> 09:47.580]  like a cup of sweat, to me.
[09:47.960 --> 09:48.900]  So like...
[09:48.900 --> 09:48.980]  Gross.
[09:49.240 --> 09:49.640]  Yeah, okay.
[09:49.980 --> 09:51.620]  So yeah, cup of sweat would be gross.
[09:51.700 --> 09:53.880]  So some of the stuff they did in Jackass 2 was...
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.600]  Yeah, there you go.
[09:56.320 --> 09:57.360]  Andrew, how about you?
[09:58.220 --> 10:01.100]  I'm trying... I would agree with... that would be bad.
[10:01.100 --> 10:04.060]  I don't know, maybe fucking just shit everywhere.
[10:04.780 --> 10:05.580]  Toilet exploded.
[10:05.960 --> 10:06.980]  That'd be pretty bad.
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.260]  All right, an exploded toilet.
[10:08.560 --> 10:09.640]  Yeah, like...
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.820]  You said it in a gross way as well.
[10:12.260 --> 10:12.940]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10:12.940 --> 10:15.780]  It's just, I was talking to somebody yesterday and they're saying at their work,
[10:15.880 --> 10:17.000]  their sink got clogged.
[10:17.040 --> 10:18.860]  It was a Vans in Texas.
[10:19.560 --> 10:21.800]  And they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the sink.
[10:22.140 --> 10:24.060]  And somebody flushed and then the sink drained.
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.100]  They're like, that was weird.
[10:25.420 --> 10:28.580]  And then they came back and apparently like the toilet fucking exploded
[10:28.580 --> 10:30.860]  and shit covered all the walls.
[10:30.860 --> 10:33.720]  They needed to get like a team in there to deal with that.
[10:33.760 --> 10:35.340]  It's a pretty fucking gross thing.
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.040]  It's an immediate one that comes to mind.
[10:37.500 --> 10:39.560]  If you have to call a team, it's gross.
[10:39.560 --> 10:41.060]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:41.400 --> 10:42.280]  Those are both hideous.
[10:42.380 --> 10:43.320]  Those are, I agree with you both.
[10:43.340 --> 10:44.240]  Those are both terrible things.
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.900]  However, there is one, at least one thing grosser.
[10:47.560 --> 10:48.760]  The grossest thing on earth.
[10:48.840 --> 10:56.280]  And the grossest thing on earth is the black, hard, crusted surface of the inside
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.700]  of a pair of Birkenstocks.
[10:58.700 --> 11:02.860]  When a person wears a pair of Birkenstocks and they sweat and it turns black
[11:02.860 --> 11:06.140]  and just like, just shimmery and gross.
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.520]  And the only difference between those Birkenstocks and anybody who doesn't wear
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.640]  socks with their fucking Nikes is that we have to see the Birkenstocks and we can't
[11:14.640 --> 11:15.240]  see the Nikes.
[11:15.720 --> 11:18.440]  My point being, I bet your shoes, you should wash your shoes.
[11:18.720 --> 11:20.760]  What, because a Birkenstock, you can see inside it?
[11:20.840 --> 11:22.500]  Yeah, you can see inside it because there's no sides.
[11:22.680 --> 11:25.900]  So you can see the damage that a dirty foot does to the insole.
[11:26.100 --> 11:28.060]  But in a regular pair of shoes, it's hidden.
[11:28.060 --> 11:32.520]  Yeah, I mean, I assume, Andrew, if you wore the same pair of socks for the same length
[11:32.520 --> 11:36.420]  of time you wore a pair of shoes, like say you got two years out of a pair of shoes,
[11:36.560 --> 11:38.140]  but you just wore a pair of socks for two years.
[11:38.620 --> 11:41.240]  I imagine it would be a hideous, crusty mess.
[11:41.580 --> 11:42.660]  It would probably not be good.
[11:42.780 --> 11:46.680]  I buy one pair of shoes a year and I just ride those out.
[11:47.180 --> 11:48.340]  Those probably don't smell great.
[11:48.480 --> 11:51.140]  But once again, I'm never smelling shoes in the wild.
[11:51.380 --> 11:52.380]  Yeah, but other people are.
[11:52.620 --> 11:52.980]  Oh, who?
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.160]  I'm saying who?
[11:54.440 --> 11:55.740]  My hand is raised.
[11:55.740 --> 11:58.940]  What if you get into a lift, get into a cab of some sort?
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.700]  Yeah, you know, I don't think you smell shoe smell in a cat.
[12:03.760 --> 12:04.200]  What do you mean?
[12:04.700 --> 12:06.380]  I'm not fucking sitting my legs up.
[12:06.500 --> 12:06.840]  What do you mean?
[12:09.620 --> 12:10.440]  Everything's down low.
[12:10.540 --> 12:13.340]  When you go to somebody's house, they have a fucking shoe closet, typically.
[12:13.680 --> 12:20.060]  I think the problem is, Andrew, it's like as a smoker doesn't ever smell cigarette smoke.
[12:20.660 --> 12:21.500]  I think you just don't.
[12:21.560 --> 12:23.000]  You're just immune to the smell.
[12:23.340 --> 12:24.900]  I'm nose blind is what you're saying.
[12:24.900 --> 12:26.560]  You might be a little nose blind to it.
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.660]  Anyway, so you never did you did you throw the underwear away or?
[12:31.920 --> 12:33.560]  I believe I threw the underwear away.
[12:33.680 --> 12:34.940]  And that's when it stopped.
[12:35.240 --> 12:37.820]  Yeah, I remember it stopping kind of around then.
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.420]  Or maybe like I don't I think it was the underwear, but it wouldn't make sense to be the underwear.
[12:42.520 --> 12:43.960]  But it stopped around that time.
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.340]  I had completely forgotten that this was the thing I went through until Gavin brought up
[12:48.340 --> 12:48.940]  that story.
[12:49.020 --> 12:54.160]  I was curious if he had a system, though, because what I did, my genius idea to deal with this
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.100]  because I was worried that somebody was going to approach me and be like, what's going on?
[12:57.240 --> 12:59.520]  I started going into that store backwards.
[12:59.800 --> 13:00.860]  That was my plan.
[13:01.380 --> 13:05.920]  Because then if anyone looked at the alarm, I'd also be looking at the sound where the
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.540]  alarm was.
[13:06.700 --> 13:10.340]  So I would just always walk into the London Drugs backwards during that time.
[13:11.240 --> 13:13.520]  It's like I don't understand that tool.
[13:14.020 --> 13:18.780]  OK, well, if I'm in the store, right, if I'm in the store already, I'm going to be look
[13:18.780 --> 13:20.020]  like the alarm goes off.
[13:20.060 --> 13:21.200]  I'm going to be looking at that.
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.760]  If I'm going in forward, I very clearly just walked in.
[13:24.960 --> 13:26.060]  I caused that alarm.
[13:26.180 --> 13:31.180]  If I go in backwards, I'm a guy near the front of the store that is also confused by the
[13:31.180 --> 13:31.400]  alarm.
[13:31.540 --> 13:34.880]  But if you're walking in backwards, you're pointing in the direction that someone would
[13:34.880 --> 13:36.240]  be facing if they were stealing.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.600]  Yeah, but I'm at the entrance of the store.
[13:39.700 --> 13:41.080]  Nobody enters on that side.
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.700]  Wait, why do they have one on the entrance?
[13:44.620 --> 13:46.440]  They got one on the entrance and exit.
[13:46.560 --> 13:47.520]  Nobody exits on that side.
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.120]  You exit near the tills, which are on the opposite side of the store.
[13:50.120 --> 13:52.860]  I'd never dare walk through what would be the exit.
[13:53.020 --> 13:57.160]  So you look like a guy walking in the entrance only backwards.
[13:57.420 --> 13:59.000]  Wait, I still don't understand.
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.840]  If they pull you into the security room and they show you the footage, are you going to
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.540]  be like, your security system is clearly recording backwards.
[14:06.660 --> 14:07.360]  I'm on the way out.
[14:07.700 --> 14:12.780]  No, if they brought me in, I'd say, look, this is the length in which I didn't want
[14:12.780 --> 14:13.220]  to be here.
[14:13.300 --> 14:14.380]  This is a clothing thing.
[14:14.680 --> 14:18.500]  I walked in backwards so that you wouldn't suspect it was me because I just didn't want
[14:18.500 --> 14:19.180]  to talk to anybody.
[14:19.180 --> 14:20.680]  Because it was front of the store.
[14:20.760 --> 14:22.100]  They had all the drinks and stuff.
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.060]  If you're prepared to do that, and I have another way I want to take this.
[14:27.160 --> 14:30.580]  But first off, if you're prepared to have that conversation, why not just have it in
[14:30.580 --> 14:31.160]  advance?
[14:31.680 --> 14:31.880]  What do you mean?
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.680]  Why not just find the security guy and say, listen, my underwear sets off the alarm.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.740]  Just to let you know, I come here a couple of times a week.
[14:39.040 --> 14:39.900]  Don't arrest me.
[14:40.220 --> 14:43.160]  See, back then, I really didn't mind talking to people.
[14:43.240 --> 14:46.580]  I used to like going through those sort of procedures as an innocent person.
[14:46.580 --> 14:50.500]  Like I didn't ever mind if my bag was like randomly inspected at airport.
[14:50.580 --> 14:54.860]  I'd be like, yeah, I feel like if you look through that bag, you'll find absolutely no
[14:54.860 --> 14:55.860]  criminal items.
[14:56.200 --> 14:57.680]  So yeah, thank you very much.
[14:57.720 --> 14:58.220]  I'll be on my way.
[14:58.380 --> 15:02.720]  But it was, it was just really good because if I ever didn't buy anything and my friend
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.860]  did and he had a bag, I would just set the thing off and I'd be like, oh my, this guy.
[15:06.940 --> 15:09.200]  And I just point at the guy and then he would get searched.
[15:09.340 --> 15:10.640]  They would almost never search me.
[15:10.760 --> 15:14.240]  And I got to the point where I was so confident doing this that even if they did search me,
[15:14.680 --> 15:17.640]  I would just be like, oh, I stole this coat from a different store.
[15:17.720 --> 15:17.940]  Don't worry.
[15:18.020 --> 15:18.760]  I didn't take it from here.
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.820]  And they'd be like, if I were you, Andrew, what I would have done is taken the underwear
[15:24.320 --> 15:27.100]  and I would have staged myself outside, balled it up.
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.560]  And then I would have waited for an old man to walk in.
[15:29.980 --> 15:32.300]  And then I would have slipped the underwear in his pocket.
[15:32.380 --> 15:34.440]  And then I would have followed him around the store.
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.900]  And then at the end, if the alarm went off, they would have come in to check on the old
[15:38.900 --> 15:39.960]  man and it would have been weird.
[15:40.020 --> 15:41.640]  And then he would have pulled the underwear out.
[15:41.640 --> 15:44.000]  And then you could have been like, oh, weird.
[15:44.140 --> 15:45.220]  Old man has my underwear.
[15:45.680 --> 15:46.780]  He's a creep.
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.200]  And then you could have got your underwear back knowing that it had that power.
[15:50.660 --> 15:53.920]  Or if you walked, if the guy walked out and the alarm didn't set off, A, you know, the
[15:53.920 --> 15:54.680]  underwear is not special.
[15:54.880 --> 15:55.540]  You let it go.
[15:55.740 --> 15:58.860]  Or B, you can do the same thing and go, hey, that old man has my underwear.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.140]  Why do you have my underwear, old man?
[16:00.180 --> 16:01.240]  And then you get your underwear back.
[16:01.580 --> 16:03.960]  Yeah, but with my shoe smell, I'm never going to sneak up on anybody.
[16:04.540 --> 16:05.300]  While with your plan.
[16:06.580 --> 16:09.120]  How am I going to creep up with this apparent shoe smell I'm dealing with?
[16:09.320 --> 16:11.100]  So we got to go all the way back to there first.
[16:11.100 --> 16:13.880]  I'm glad you shove a pair of socks on for other people's houses, though.
[16:13.900 --> 16:15.020]  I think that's quite considerate.
[16:15.440 --> 16:18.620]  And I feel like that is what I would expect of someone.
[16:18.780 --> 16:24.800]  But in America, there's like a weird thing with socks because Americans, you could either
[16:24.800 --> 16:28.940]  get the barefoot or you could get the person who doesn't even take the shoe off, which
[16:28.940 --> 16:31.400]  to me is an insane decision to make.
[16:32.080 --> 16:35.100]  It's you never know when you when you invite someone into your house.
[16:35.280 --> 16:37.600]  You never know what their norm will be.
[16:37.600 --> 16:42.160]  And usually, in my experience, it's people putting their shoes on my couch.
[16:42.560 --> 16:42.760]  All right.
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.280]  There's no need for it.
[16:44.520 --> 16:45.640]  The sock is fine.
[16:45.800 --> 16:50.780]  It's probably cleaner than the barefoot and the shoe because it's the least used thing.
[16:51.320 --> 16:57.200]  Yeah, I got to say, if we're not at the beach, I don't want to see your feet ever.
[16:57.340 --> 17:02.140]  I will never subject anyone to a barefoot unless there's water involved.
[17:02.360 --> 17:04.040]  There's got to be water involved, right?
[17:04.060 --> 17:05.640]  There's got to be water sports involved.
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.900]  I also, I got to go.
[17:07.960 --> 17:08.620]  I agree with you, Gavin.
[17:08.660 --> 17:11.920]  I think it's a little, um, it's just you just think about all the doo-doo and stuff you bring
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.480]  in on your shoes into somebody else's house.
[17:13.580 --> 17:14.540]  I mean, I guess it's their house.
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.780]  But you are one of the people who yelled at me for for going sock in-house.
[17:19.100 --> 17:20.540]  Yeah, I just don't like socks.
[17:22.900 --> 17:26.820]  I don't know why you would rather me walk around your house with shoes and sit on your
[17:26.820 --> 17:27.660]  couch with shoes on.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.120]  I don't want you sitting on my couch with shoes on.
[17:30.160 --> 17:31.380]  I don't want you to put the shoes on my couch.
[17:31.500 --> 17:32.500]  Wait, what do you want from me then?
[17:32.560 --> 17:33.160]  What do you want from me?
[17:33.160 --> 17:36.260]  I've always just slipped the shoes off the door, just gone socked.
[17:36.560 --> 17:38.320]  I don't have a problem with you going socked.
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.740]  When did I ever have a problem with you going socked?
[17:40.780 --> 17:43.160]  I'm sure there's a recorded conversation.
[17:43.380 --> 17:47.200]  I don't want to see I don't want to see your feet and seeing your socks is better than
[17:47.200 --> 17:49.320]  seeing your feet, but it still looks like a foot a little bit.
[17:49.480 --> 17:52.520]  So like if you know how people have foot fetishes, I guess I'm the opposite.
[17:52.900 --> 17:54.720]  I'm the I have I have a foot anti-fetish.
[17:54.920 --> 17:57.040]  I don't want to ever say I don't want to see what your foot looks like.
[17:57.100 --> 17:58.000]  I don't want to see your foot shape.
[17:58.340 --> 17:59.680]  I don't want to see your toes sticking out.
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.080]  So I guess I guess when I lived with you and I had to look at your dumb feet through socks,
[18:04.080 --> 18:06.140]  I probably got annoyed over time.
[18:06.440 --> 18:07.260]  You know what?
[18:07.900 --> 18:08.960]  I'll go ahead and say it, Gav.
[18:09.040 --> 18:11.320]  It was probably an unwinnable situation for you.
[18:11.480 --> 18:12.220]  Yeah, I apologize.
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.100]  But then again, when when like Ben would come to stay, he was his socks were off as he was
[18:17.100 --> 18:17.800]  walking in.
[18:18.200 --> 18:20.060]  He would he would be kicking socks all over the place.
[18:20.300 --> 18:23.260]  He had probably 12 pairs of socks around your living room.
[18:23.320 --> 18:25.320]  And to me, that was outrageous.
[18:25.540 --> 18:28.160]  But you still yelling at me about my socks on.
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.700]  I love Ben.
[18:30.060 --> 18:31.000]  We all love Ben.
[18:31.600 --> 18:35.760]  But Ben was an unteachable, untrainable person when it came to that stuff.
[18:35.940 --> 18:42.180]  There was no point in me trying to get Ben to pick up candy wrappers or throw away pizza boxes
[18:42.180 --> 18:46.420]  or keep his socks anywhere out of my important shit.
[18:46.900 --> 18:48.160]  It just wasn't going to happen.
[18:48.320 --> 18:49.840]  So I just learned to live with it.
[18:49.880 --> 18:51.200]  You got to temper your expectations.
[18:51.500 --> 18:53.880]  You, I have higher standards or different standards.
[18:53.880 --> 18:54.780]  I shouldn't say higher standards.
[18:54.940 --> 18:55.400]  They're not higher.
[18:55.820 --> 18:56.900]  I had a lot of high standards for it.
[18:56.900 --> 18:59.160]  I just I have different standards for you, Gavin.
[18:59.220 --> 19:01.400]  And I think that there are things that you are capable of.
[19:01.600 --> 19:02.560]  Well, I did my best.
[19:02.840 --> 19:04.840]  I was I'm in a new country.
[19:04.980 --> 19:06.440]  You know, I didn't know what you wanted from me.
[19:06.520 --> 19:08.920]  I just assumed this was the least offensive move.
[19:09.220 --> 19:09.760]  I listen.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.160]  I thought it was a huge success when we lived together.
[19:12.360 --> 19:12.900]  I loved it.
[19:13.220 --> 19:14.000]  I would go back to that.
[19:14.300 --> 19:14.460]  Yeah.
[19:14.780 --> 19:16.600]  Would you say you're a shoe guy, Geoff?
[19:16.980 --> 19:17.180]  Yeah.
[19:17.560 --> 19:20.820]  Do you now are you a shoe guy because you like shoes or that's how much you hate feet?
[19:21.200 --> 19:21.520]  Both.
[19:21.840 --> 19:24.100]  I like I like I like a kind of shoe.
[19:24.140 --> 19:24.820]  I like vans.
[19:24.820 --> 19:27.660]  You know, I've got like my 60 pairs of vans or whatever.
[19:28.420 --> 19:33.640]  And then and like two pairs of Nike's, one for running and one for cross training, like
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.340]  climbing, like like like mountain climbing and not mountain climbing.
[19:37.660 --> 19:38.180]  I don't do that shit.
[19:38.300 --> 19:42.300]  Like hiking, you know, like like cross training or whatever they call it for running around
[19:42.300 --> 19:44.180]  the woods and then for running around in streets.
[19:44.360 --> 19:47.680]  There's the only acceptable time to wear running shoes.
[19:47.840 --> 19:48.980]  And then the rest is vans.
[19:49.240 --> 19:49.880]  Like trail running.
[19:50.260 --> 19:50.460]  Yeah.
[19:50.600 --> 19:50.840]  OK.
[19:51.120 --> 19:54.400]  So I do like, you know, I do collect those shoes, I guess.
[19:54.820 --> 19:56.700]  But I also I just don't I just don't like feet.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.260]  I don't like to think about them.
[19:58.760 --> 19:59.640]  Are you a shoe guy, Gavin?
[20:00.000 --> 20:00.380]  Do you buy?
[20:00.560 --> 20:02.380]  How many pairs of shoes do you buy per year?
[20:02.680 --> 20:06.320]  I usually buy like one pair of custom Converse every year.
[20:06.360 --> 20:06.520]  OK.
[20:06.800 --> 20:10.400]  And I try and make them hideous to look at, like offensive to the eyes.
[20:11.160 --> 20:11.920]  You do great.
[20:12.020 --> 20:12.660]  What's do you have?
[20:12.720 --> 20:15.860]  Do you have like an example of like a best of worst shoe?
[20:16.020 --> 20:23.420]  My current ones have like the zebra striped rubber around the rim with avocados and lemons
[20:23.420 --> 20:27.680]  and strawberries in like a clashing pattern all around the thing.
[20:27.980 --> 20:29.060]  And I think a pink part.
[20:29.480 --> 20:30.620]  I don't know, I can send you some pictures.
[20:30.900 --> 20:32.500]  They're awful.
[20:33.200 --> 20:34.360]  That sounds bad.
[20:34.700 --> 20:34.840]  Yeah.
[20:35.120 --> 20:36.680]  Nick's not a sock guy either.
[20:37.220 --> 20:37.300]  Yeah.
[20:37.540 --> 20:40.640]  Nick, what are your thoughts on this sock situation?
[20:40.820 --> 20:42.400]  Why do you why do you avoid the sock?
[20:42.760 --> 20:44.440]  Well, no, I don't like socks.
[20:44.740 --> 20:48.100]  They're not very comfortable and I won't wear them around my own house.
[20:48.180 --> 20:49.780]  I will stay barefoot at all times if I can.
[20:50.140 --> 20:52.480]  If I'm going to a friend's house or whatever, I'll wear socks,
[20:52.480 --> 20:57.220]  wear shoes and I'll make sure to keep them on unless my friend is cool with me taking off the shoes.
[20:57.560 --> 20:58.800]  What if you're going to the store?
[20:59.080 --> 21:01.000]  Are you going to throw socks on to go to the store?
[21:01.380 --> 21:03.540]  Yeah, we'll throw socks on for that.
[21:03.760 --> 21:04.960]  See, that's too much work.
[21:05.340 --> 21:06.960]  Yeah, I feel like you are a sock guy then.
[21:07.500 --> 21:08.460]  Yeah, he is a sock guy.
[21:08.620 --> 21:09.960]  I disagree with him.
[21:10.140 --> 21:12.620]  In your own home doesn't really count, I think.
[21:12.700 --> 21:14.020]  No, you can do whatever you want.
[21:14.160 --> 21:14.840]  You set the rules.
[21:15.020 --> 21:20.480]  I wear socks at home for a good reason in that there's four cats and there's probably like
[21:20.480 --> 21:22.800]  cat food crumbs around where we feed them.
[21:22.920 --> 21:27.440]  And I hate having to scrape that off the bottom of my foot and a sock will get in the way of that.
[21:27.660 --> 21:28.940]  And then I sweep that shit.
[21:29.400 --> 21:32.980]  It's just a lack of convenience having to throw socks on if you're just doing like one stop.
[21:33.160 --> 21:34.260]  So I'm not a sock guy.
[21:34.640 --> 21:37.240]  I only own, I have like 40 pairs of the same sock.
[21:37.600 --> 21:38.800]  I'm a big convenience person.
[21:39.120 --> 21:42.460]  Yeah, but you live in the most, you have to shimmy into bed every night.
[21:42.500 --> 21:43.380]  No, no, no, no, I fixed that.
[21:43.420 --> 21:44.240]  I fixed that, Gavin.
[21:44.480 --> 21:45.040]  That's done.
[21:45.540 --> 21:46.380]  I moved things around.
[21:46.380 --> 21:49.060]  Last time you knocked over a cabinet or something.
[21:49.600 --> 21:50.860]  Slipped on a sushi bag.
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.620]  I did, well, it's a plastic container.
[21:52.720 --> 21:53.060]  It's not a bag.
[21:53.700 --> 21:54.760]  We're not having that debate again.
[21:54.920 --> 21:57.520]  So what modifications were made to your living situation?
[21:57.700 --> 22:00.140]  Oh, I just, I moved, I had this 50 inch TV.
[22:00.460 --> 22:01.740]  It was kind of blocking the way.
[22:01.920 --> 22:05.000]  Moved that and I moved the filing cabinet and we're all good.
[22:05.600 --> 22:06.660]  I have so much more room.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.140]  You have a filing cabinet?
[22:07.220 --> 22:07.940]  Filing cabinet.
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.220]  Yeah, I have a filing cabinet.
[22:09.360 --> 22:10.600]  For all of your documents.
[22:10.820 --> 22:12.960]  Yeah, how many documents do you have that you need a cabinet?
[22:13.440 --> 22:16.020]  I have less than six documents, I'd assume.
[22:16.020 --> 22:19.840]  It's mainly filled with like old video games and shit like that.
[22:21.360 --> 22:22.620]  So Andrew, I have a question.
[22:22.820 --> 22:25.020]  You just said you have, you're a big convenience guy.
[22:26.120 --> 22:27.460]  That was convenient for me.
[22:28.260 --> 22:31.120]  And you said you have like 40 pairs of the same socks.
[22:31.560 --> 22:31.760]  Yep.
[22:32.180 --> 22:34.020]  But you don't wear socks.
[22:34.820 --> 22:36.240]  So here's what I'm worried about.
[22:36.340 --> 22:39.580]  I'm worried that we haven't keyed into the, I think we've gotten very close.
[22:39.920 --> 22:42.880]  But I don't think we've keyed into the fact that you might be a hoarder.
[22:43.120 --> 22:44.180]  No, I'm not a hoarder.
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.940]  40 pairs of socks you don't wear?
[22:46.280 --> 22:48.660]  No, they're all in a fucking, they're in a nice thing.
[22:49.060 --> 22:50.560]  It's one of the best things I've ever done.
[22:50.900 --> 22:52.120]  Yeah, they're in a beautiful filing cabinet.
[22:52.540 --> 22:54.560]  They're filed under S.
[22:54.720 --> 22:55.060]  For socks.
[22:56.700 --> 22:59.520]  You're joking, but I do think I put my socks in there at one point.
[22:59.580 --> 23:01.120]  But they're no longer in the filing cabinet.
[23:01.540 --> 23:02.060]  Come on.
[23:02.800 --> 23:04.660]  Well, it's like a fancy filing cabinet.
[23:04.780 --> 23:05.840]  It's not like a metal one.
[23:05.980 --> 23:08.460]  Filed under N for never wear.
[23:10.560 --> 23:13.080]  On the road, when I travel, I bring socks.
[23:13.080 --> 23:15.880]  And it was always an inconvenience if you fucking lose a sock.
[23:15.920 --> 23:17.920]  And then you miss, they match.
[23:18.040 --> 23:18.880]  I can't fucking speak.
[23:19.220 --> 23:20.160]  How do you lose a sock?
[23:20.560 --> 23:21.420]  Well, they just vanish.
[23:21.440 --> 23:22.500]  What do you mean, how do you lose a sock?
[23:22.540 --> 23:25.020]  I feel like the sock is the most relatably lost thing.
[23:25.400 --> 23:26.120]  It just vanished.
[23:26.420 --> 23:27.120]  You can never find pairs.
[23:27.480 --> 23:28.760]  Yeah, you never find pairs though.
[23:28.960 --> 23:30.240]  It's a constant struggle for pairs.
[23:30.460 --> 23:32.020]  So I gave away all my socks.
[23:32.180 --> 23:35.240]  And then I just bought like 40 pairs from Costco.
[23:35.580 --> 23:36.500]  All of the same.
[23:36.700 --> 23:37.880]  And I just don't think about it.
[23:38.120 --> 23:41.240]  What if socks worked like kids mittens?
[23:41.240 --> 23:44.140]  Like, do you ever have a pair of mittens where they were attached with string?
[23:44.380 --> 23:47.080]  And they go down your sleeve, like around your back and down the other one.
[23:47.420 --> 23:53.460]  What if socks went up each leg of your shorts or trousers and were connected that way?
[23:53.780 --> 23:54.300]  That makes sense.
[23:54.720 --> 23:56.300]  Ah, that just seems like it would get dirty.
[23:56.820 --> 23:57.340]  I'm not a fan.
[23:57.380 --> 23:57.920]  Like, I'm okay.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.320]  We just get no socks.
[23:59.780 --> 24:00.940]  Unless I'm going to someone's house.
[24:01.540 --> 24:02.360]  Then I'll follow the rules.
[24:02.520 --> 24:03.340]  I'm not a monster.
[24:04.260 --> 24:05.860]  I wouldn't subject somebody to that.
[24:06.220 --> 24:06.620]  Getting wet.
[24:06.700 --> 24:08.500]  Do we have any other talk about socks?
[24:08.540 --> 24:09.820]  Because there's something I want to press.
[24:10.120 --> 24:10.980]  Are we good with socks?
[24:11.620 --> 24:17.740]  Well, you know, I would like to point out, I think we are still releasing two left socks.
[24:18.180 --> 24:18.460]  Are we?
[24:18.860 --> 24:19.840]  I think so.
[24:20.060 --> 24:20.520]  I'm not sure.
[24:20.740 --> 24:21.160]  What happened with that?
[24:21.380 --> 24:23.860]  I think that it takes longer to get socks made than other things.
[24:24.440 --> 24:27.480]  They're not print on demand socks, unfortunately.
[24:27.740 --> 24:30.240]  Also, one episode, you're like, we need to do the sock thing.
[24:30.280 --> 24:32.440]  And then the next episode, you're like, I'm fucking done with socks.
[24:32.500 --> 24:33.760]  Let's never talk about socks again.
[24:33.840 --> 24:34.620]  So it's kind of like...
[24:34.620 --> 24:35.380]  I still want to sell them.
[24:35.560 --> 24:38.100]  I still want people to be able to enjoy the bit.
[24:38.160 --> 24:40.980]  I mean, technically, Andrew, this is a new conversation about socks.
[24:40.980 --> 24:45.000]  This isn't rehashing Geoff's stupid foot thing.
[24:45.440 --> 24:48.180]  This has nothing to do with the mysteries of my feet.
[24:48.280 --> 24:51.200]  And it wouldn't at all have even come up if you hadn't brought it up, Andrew.
[24:51.280 --> 24:52.320]  I was not going to mention.
[24:52.420 --> 24:53.240]  I wasn't going to make the correlation.
[24:53.240 --> 24:55.460]  The product was absolutely connected to that.
[24:55.520 --> 24:55.980]  But that's fine.
[24:56.160 --> 24:57.060]  What are you going to say?
[24:57.880 --> 25:02.160]  I was going to say, while we're talking about merch,
[25:02.880 --> 25:06.300]  should we figure out the record thing at some point?
[25:06.600 --> 25:08.320]  Yeah, I have something to say about that.
[25:08.320 --> 25:14.240]  So we have a merchandise chat and we're talking about somebody in the community
[25:14.240 --> 25:17.460]  suggested we do a vinyl of an episode of the show.
[25:17.560 --> 25:19.540]  Which my daughter told me is a good idea.
[25:19.700 --> 25:20.500]  And that's all I need.
[25:20.660 --> 25:22.060]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a fun thing.
[25:22.120 --> 25:23.720]  Like, we could do art on the thing.
[25:23.780 --> 25:26.100]  It's just it'd be kind of a cool collectible to have.
[25:26.380 --> 25:28.020]  There's discussion, like, what episode?
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.520]  And we're kind of leaning towards the first.
[25:29.900 --> 25:32.500]  And then there was talk of like, well, what if we just
[25:32.900 --> 25:34.920]  redo the first episode word for word?
[25:35.420 --> 25:36.940]  I've done... that's fluke face.
[25:36.940 --> 25:39.020]  You're just fucking describing fluke face.
[25:39.120 --> 25:39.600]  We've done that.
[25:39.600 --> 25:40.460]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:40.500 --> 25:41.880]  That's not what I was suggesting at all.
[25:42.060 --> 25:46.400]  And to further make sense of it, Gavin said maybe we should do episode 16.
[25:47.040 --> 25:48.540]  I said we should do episode 1.
[25:48.660 --> 25:52.000]  Gavin brought up the point that episode 1 of fluke face is not very good.
[25:52.300 --> 25:53.560]  It's not worth listening to.
[25:53.720 --> 25:55.740]  It doesn't reflect what we became.
[25:55.940 --> 25:56.720]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[25:56.780 --> 26:00.360]  I would say the last 15 minutes are OK, but the first 20 is a little rough.
[26:00.500 --> 26:01.280]  So I do agree.
[26:01.380 --> 26:03.000]  It feels weird to celebrate that.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.040]  So what I was saying, Andrew, is not to redo it word for word,
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.280]  but to look at the topics that we covered and then put those in our heads
[26:12.280 --> 26:16.100]  and then go through it again and do like a fresh second take.
[26:16.260 --> 26:18.640]  Now that we're so much more comfortable doing fluke face.
[26:18.960 --> 26:20.620]  So it's essentially the same conversation.
[26:20.640 --> 26:21.580]  It's not word for word.
[26:21.780 --> 26:24.660]  It's just it's similar, but we're better at it.
[26:24.740 --> 26:26.240]  And then we put that on the record.
[26:26.300 --> 26:31.920]  And then it's episode 1, like H.D. George Lucas version, whatever, right?
[26:31.920 --> 26:33.320]  And the only way to hear it.
[26:33.420 --> 26:34.020]  Yeah, special edition.
[26:34.180 --> 26:38.040]  The only way to hear it is on that record, which then increases the value of the record.
[26:38.060 --> 26:41.500]  And it doesn't fuck with the timeline of the podcast online.
[26:41.800 --> 26:42.220]  What is?
[26:42.360 --> 26:43.480]  It's a great thought.
[26:43.820 --> 26:47.660]  But what if the vinyl was the first thing we recorded in person?
[26:48.100 --> 26:49.640]  Well, when are we going to do that?
[26:49.740 --> 26:51.780]  We're fucking going to release a vinyl in 2024.
[26:52.420 --> 26:53.140]  Like, what do you mean?
[26:53.520 --> 26:55.680]  Well, I mean, we could we could all meet up this year.
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.220]  Potentially. Yeah, I guess.
[26:57.240 --> 26:58.340]  But that's like a long way.
[26:58.340 --> 27:00.140]  Like we're putting that on ice for a while.
[27:00.140 --> 27:02.400]  And also, it's going to take Andrew.
[27:02.540 --> 27:05.500]  He's going to need at least six weeks notice to start the trip.
[27:05.820 --> 27:06.540]  That's true.
[27:08.720 --> 27:10.820]  If I could survive making it out of my place.
[27:11.040 --> 27:14.080]  I wouldn't be surprised if Andrew, for some random reason,
[27:14.380 --> 27:18.280]  was the last person in the entirety of Canada to get vaccinated.
[27:18.680 --> 27:22.120]  It wouldn't be on purpose.
[27:22.240 --> 27:23.440]  I'd love to get the vaccine.
[27:23.980 --> 27:26.340]  I think the problem with doing your idea, Geoff, rehashing,
[27:26.340 --> 27:28.260]  I remember episode one pretty clearly,
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.860]  because it's one of the only episodes I've ever listened to,
[27:31.280 --> 27:33.540]  because I rerecorded it when I did Flukeface.
[27:33.700 --> 27:33.900]  Yes.
[27:34.380 --> 27:38.440]  I don't think there's really any updates to the kind of main topics of that episode.
[27:38.580 --> 27:39.820]  I still haven't got my haircut.
[27:40.240 --> 27:42.120]  I'm still not allowed to go to the retirement home.
[27:42.240 --> 27:43.600]  I don't even know if that guy's still working.
[27:44.060 --> 27:45.740]  Was that basket weaving in that one?
[27:46.600 --> 27:47.580]  That came later.
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.840]  We'll just have that conversation again.
[27:50.340 --> 27:52.120]  Just imagine if we were like, all right, that was good.
[27:52.320 --> 27:53.520]  Let's do it again. Take two.
[27:53.820 --> 27:55.400]  We're not following the script word for word,
[27:55.400 --> 27:57.200]  but we're just going over the same themes.
[27:57.320 --> 27:58.540]  Maybe we add a little bit more to it.
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.160]  Maybe we remember the story a little bit differently,
[28:00.320 --> 28:01.380]  but we're more confident.
[28:01.700 --> 28:02.800]  We've got more chemistry.
[28:03.300 --> 28:05.880]  We've worked, you know, we're better at what we're doing.
[28:06.240 --> 28:08.700]  We're past our 10,000 hours of ****.
[28:08.700 --> 28:10.900]  Sure. Yeah, that's fair.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.640]  I just, I don't know what other takes we would have on the subjects of that episode.
[28:15.640 --> 28:19.920]  I also don't care enough one way or the other to make a big deal out of it.
[28:20.100 --> 28:23.760]  We could also not make the album, or we could make the album and put episode one on it,
[28:23.760 --> 28:26.280]  or we could make the album and put episode 16 on it.
[28:27.140 --> 28:32.620]  Or we could just ****, we could throw a dart at a board and use that episode for all I care.
[28:33.000 --> 28:33.660]  I just want to make a record.
[28:33.740 --> 28:34.080]  We could make a cassette.
[28:34.600 --> 28:35.500]  What about cassettes?
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.680]  We could do that too.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.140]  Nobody's making cassettes.
[28:38.920 --> 28:40.080]  Reel-to-reel tape.
[28:40.380 --> 28:41.800]  Yeah, we can make an 8-track.
[28:42.260 --> 28:44.640]  We can make a laserdisc, an audio-only laserdisc.
[28:44.660 --> 28:45.880]  Oh man, that'd be great.
[28:46.420 --> 28:47.380]  Laserdiscs were awesome.
[28:47.760 --> 28:48.080]  Yeah, they were.
[28:48.500 --> 28:49.800]  I never, I never touched one.
[28:50.240 --> 28:50.460]  Really?
[28:50.520 --> 28:50.700]  Really.
[28:51.280 --> 28:53.160]  They were pretty fancy and for pretty rich people.
[28:53.160 --> 28:55.220]  It was like a big DVD, wasn't it?
[28:55.460 --> 28:58.220]  Yeah, my mom, like my grandma had a friend who had one,
[28:58.300 --> 29:01.180]  and we would go over and watch the Star Wars laserdisc sometimes.
[29:02.300 --> 29:02.780]  Fancy.
[29:07.650 --> 29:10.630]  Imagine jumping in the shower and not turning on the water,
[29:10.810 --> 29:12.910]  just wiping your body with dry paper.
[29:13.230 --> 29:16.850]  People would call you crazy, stupid, ridiculous, annoying.
[29:17.070 --> 29:18.610]  Why is he doing that, they say?
[29:18.730 --> 29:20.090]  What's wrong with that person?
[29:20.250 --> 29:21.070]  Oh my lord.
[29:21.390 --> 29:25.570]  So why wipe a dry toilet paper instead of washing with water?
[29:25.770 --> 29:28.130]  The future of toileting has arrived.
[29:28.410 --> 29:29.890]  Thousands and thousands of years ago,
[29:30.050 --> 29:34.290]  but it's circled around the block and it's back again, but cheap this time.
[29:34.490 --> 29:38.670]  Because now the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 modern bidet attachment
[29:38.670 --> 29:40.530]  is here to level the playing field.
[29:40.890 --> 29:44.590]  It's stylish, it's eco-friendly, it's easy to install, and it's affordable.
[29:45.130 --> 29:49.090]  Hello Tushy 3.0 doesn't just cleanse your butt with a precise stream of fresh water.
[29:50.090 --> 29:51.270]  That's the stream sound.
[29:51.450 --> 29:52.630]  It cleans itself.
[29:53.290 --> 29:53.850]  SSSSSS.
[29:53.970 --> 29:54.830]  That's the clean sound.
[29:55.170 --> 30:00.550]  Before and after it's used with the smart spray automatic self-cleaning nozzle.
[30:00.830 --> 30:05.030]  It attaches to your existing toilet, requires no electricity or additional plumbing,
[30:05.030 --> 30:07.750]  and it cuts your paper use by 80%.
[30:08.310 --> 30:11.270]  So the Hello Tushy bidet pays for itself in a few months
[30:11.270 --> 30:13.970]  and the trees, the ints, will thank you.
[30:14.090 --> 30:16.470]  Because with Hello Tushy, you don't wipe at all.
[30:16.690 --> 30:20.010]  Just poop, spray, dry, go, and save the trees.
[30:20.010 --> 30:25.350]  And sanitation is simple because the Smudge Shield offers easy cleaning and the knobs are naturally
[30:26.010 --> 30:30.430]  antimicrobial which, I gotta be honest, in 2021 I feel like that's gotta be the base standard for
[30:30.430 --> 30:35.390]  all knobs. All knobs should be antimicrobial from this point on. Plus, every Hello Tushy
[30:35.390 --> 30:40.250]  bidet attachment comes with a 60-day risk-free guarantee and a 12-month warranty. Have you
[30:40.250 --> 30:44.610]  already got a tush on your pot? Why not upgrade to the new 3.0 model? If you're new to the
[30:44.610 --> 30:49.330]  revolution, join millions of happy Hello Tushy customers right now and have a clean butt with
[30:49.330 --> 30:56.290]  every flush. Our listeners can go to HelloTushy.com slash face for 10% off plus free shipping. Get 10%

[31:02.510 --> 31:08.550]  slash face. Butt. Clean. Go. We've got a very different kind of sponsor for this episode.
[31:08.690 --> 31:14.390]  That different kind of sponsor is none other than the Jordan Harbinger Show. It's a podcast you
[31:14.390 --> 31:19.090]  really should be listening to, which I'm gonna figure you like podcasts, right? You're listening
[31:19.090 --> 31:23.890]  to this one, so it stands to reason that you might like to listen to a different one in addition to
[31:23.890 --> 31:28.510]  this one. And I know that every day somebody tells you, like I'm about to do, you've got to listen
[31:28.510 --> 31:33.410]  to some podcast. And you're like, yeah, sure, okay, I'll listen to that. Right. Put that on my to-do
[31:33.410 --> 31:39.910]  list. Flush. Yeah. But this is not one of those moments. This is actually one of those shows you
[31:39.910 --> 31:46.590]  should probably go listen to. Jordan's show was named one of the best of 2018 by Apple. Good lord,
[31:46.590 --> 31:50.870]  I got it right that time. And it's aimed at making you a better informed, more critical thinker,
[31:51.050 --> 31:54.750]  so you can get a sense of how the world actually works and come to your own conclusions about
[31:54.750 --> 31:58.490]  what's happening, even inside your own brain. I don't know about you, but I could use a couple
[31:58.490 --> 32:03.490]  of conclusions about what's going on inside my brain, because it is frustrating. Each episode
[32:03.490 --> 32:07.290]  is a conversation with a different fascinating guest. And when I say there's something for
[32:07.290 --> 32:12.110]  everybody, I do mean that. There's hostage negotiator interviews. There's interviews
[32:12.110 --> 32:18.170]  with cinematographers who talk about lost cities in the jungle. I know Trevor is really big on
[32:18.170 --> 32:23.550]  lost stuff and conspiracy stuff. I know that would be interesting to him. So as you can see, hopefully,
[32:23.830 --> 32:27.750]  there's a whole bunch of stuff you might find interesting. He's always focused on pulling
[32:27.750 --> 32:32.010]  useful, practical insights out of his brilliant guests. And we're not talking about pop psychology
[32:32.010 --> 32:37.070]  or wishwashy self-help stuff here. The episodes are loaded with bits of wisdom that you can use
[32:37.070 --> 32:40.870]  to legitimately change your mind and improve your life right away. And I don't know about you,
[32:40.870 --> 32:46.630]  but I'm on the improving train. Personally, I hope you are, too. If that's not worth checking out,
[32:46.950 --> 32:51.070]  I'm not sure what is. We really enjoy this show, and we think you will as well. Search for the
[32:51.070 --> 32:58.650]  Jordan Harbinger Show. That's H-A-R-B as in boy, I-N as in Nancy, G-E-R as in gir,
[32:59.030 --> 33:03.810]  on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.
[33:05.650 --> 33:11.070]  Well, you know, remember when the salad cream was big on f**kface, and we had all this build-up,
[33:11.530 --> 33:16.390]  and then Andrew... I don't know what you would call what he did to that bit. He definitely
[33:16.390 --> 33:20.490]  improved it, but it was not what I expected. Well, you... I take... I confirm... Once again,
[33:20.550 --> 33:24.230]  I reject that. Before we just go too far, I want to bring up something because we keep forgetting
[33:24.230 --> 33:27.890]  this. Oh, okay. Gavin, you and I talked about this immediately. Geoff, are you good with merch?
[33:28.210 --> 33:31.670]  Do we want to go back to merch? Are you good with socks? I don't think we got an answer to
[33:31.670 --> 33:34.290]  what episode we're going to release, but I don't... No, I'm definitely good with socks. Oh,
[33:34.310 --> 33:39.870]  are you hoping for a resolution? I was hoping to give Tony and Robert some marching orders.
[33:40.450 --> 33:44.670]  We'll figure it out. We can do that later. Great. Thank you. I have a very important
[33:44.670 --> 33:52.090]  question for you, Geoff. Where the f**k is the port-a-potty? What's going on with the port-a-potty?
[33:53.850 --> 33:57.010]  You're asking me? I'm asking you. Where the f**k is the port-a-potty?
[33:57.010 --> 34:01.910]  Uh, well, first off, I don't appreciate your aggressive tone. No, I'll be very aggressive.
[34:02.030 --> 34:05.890]  I bought you. That is a very f**king expensive gift that was out of the kindness of my heart.
[34:06.130 --> 34:11.590]  Where's the port-a-potty? Here's the deal. I don't know. Oh, come on. No, I don't know.
[34:11.750 --> 34:17.390]  What do you mean you don't know? I mean, I don't know where it is. They definitely,
[34:17.710 --> 34:26.210]  they have definitely called. Unfortunately, I wasn't available to take the call when they called
[34:26.210 --> 34:32.990]  and they left me a message, a very nice message, about delivering a port-a-potty,
[34:34.690 --> 34:41.810]  which leads me to believe that it is real and does exist. No, it does. Unfortunately, as far as
[34:42.370 --> 34:49.510]  we know, the number to call them back was garbled. And then it, I don't know, it got deleted or
[34:49.510 --> 34:52.830]  something. So I couldn't, I could never find the number to call them back. Yeah. And then...
[34:52.830 --> 34:58.830]  It's in your history. It wasn't, though. It was weird. And then they called again and left
[34:58.830 --> 35:03.690]  another message and then the same thing happened. And then they called a third time. And unbelievably,
[35:03.690 --> 35:10.750]  I missed that call, too. And so we just keep missing each other. Yeah, here's the problem
[35:10.750 --> 35:14.750]  with that. I know. It's frustrating, right? It's frustrating for me, too. No, it's not,
[35:14.990 --> 35:19.150]  I'm calling. We were in a fucking meeting yesterday and you said word for word,
[35:19.150 --> 35:23.690]  I'm trying to fucking dodge these calls. I've been working on dodging these calls left and right.
[35:23.990 --> 35:27.130]  You said it yesterday in passing. Eric was there. I don't know if Eric heard it,
[35:27.570 --> 35:32.230]  but you said it. I don't remember. I don't remember saying it in that way. I can confirm
[35:32.230 --> 35:38.750]  he did say that. I think I remember saying, I'm trying not to dodge these calls is what I
[35:38.750 --> 35:44.390]  remember saying. I'm doing my best to dodge these port-a-potty calls, which I will not stand for.
[35:44.410 --> 35:47.670]  This is frustrating. I'm doing my best not to dodge these calls, but it just keeps being
[35:47.670 --> 35:53.330]  inconvenient. Geoff, if you do not get this port-a-potty, I will not stop sending you fucking
[35:53.330 --> 35:59.290]  port-a-potties until you get one. Look, man, I want it, too. No, you don't. They have my address,
[35:59.630 --> 36:05.510]  Andrew. What am I supposed to do? You've got to consider the carbon footprint of this port-a-potty's
[36:05.510 --> 36:10.770]  journey. He didn't buy one in Austin. He bought one in like Indiana or something. Then it's
[36:10.770 --> 36:15.710]  probably that if we're worried about the carbon footprint of it, then it's probably doing more
[36:15.710 --> 36:20.450]  good for the environment sitting in a warehouse somewhere in Austin. Not being loaded onto a
[36:20.450 --> 36:28.910]  truck full of gas and coal while it belches destruction all the way to my house, destroying
[36:28.910 --> 36:35.110]  every bit of life in its wake. I don't want that for our Geoff. I'm trying to keep a world around
[36:35.110 --> 36:41.070]  for my daughter and her kids. Let's think about the future. If that port-a-potty is not there,
[36:41.210 --> 36:45.690]  we're recording two episodes today. If that port-a-potty is not there by the next time we
[36:45.690 --> 36:51.950]  record, there will be consequences and it will not stop. It will not fucking stop. Oh yeah, you
[36:51.950 --> 36:56.750]  just add another one to the cop. I like it. Look man, I'm as frustrated as you. It's gonna go beyond
[36:56.750 --> 36:59.730]  port-a-potty. No, you're not. You're stalling. You're dodging this. You're doing everything
[36:59.730 --> 37:05.510]  you can. If that port-a-potty is not there by the next time that we record, there will be fucking
[37:05.510 --> 37:08.810]  problems. What do you want me to do? They haven't brought it. Get the fucking port-a-potty. It's
[37:08.810 --> 37:14.470]  there. What do you mean? What do you want me to fucking call them? I don't have the guy's number.
[37:14.470 --> 37:20.990]  What do you mean? They called you. They called you. I get so many calls. Oh, shut the fuck up.
[37:21.190 --> 37:25.750]  That is such bullshit. I get so much spam. I get 20 calls of spam a day. That's established. We've
[37:25.750 --> 37:30.610]  talked about that many times on the podcast. You could call them right now. You could. I don't know
[37:30.610 --> 37:36.230]  the number. Give me the number. They called you. Fucking... I don't know. How many freight companies
[37:36.230 --> 37:41.470]  do you have phoning you, Geoff? I don't know. Zero, except for the fucking port-a-potty number.
[37:41.470 --> 37:47.030]  When was the last time they called? About four days ago. A while ago, because it arrived in
[37:47.030 --> 37:56.690]  Austin on March 6th. That's almost two weeks ago. I don't understand how it's my fault that I haven't
[37:56.690 --> 38:02.730]  received something that was sent to me. I didn't ask for it. Because you're actively avoiding
[38:02.730 --> 38:08.290]  getting it. What do you mean you don't understand? I'm in my house. Bring it over right now. I haven't
[38:08.290 --> 38:13.110]  left. There's a pandemic. I haven't gone anywhere in a year. They know where I live.
[38:13.530 --> 38:19.150]  You gave them my address. Just answer the phone. I don't like to talk to strangers, Andrew. I'm shy.
[38:21.970 --> 38:27.770]  Why don't they text me? I'll handle it with text. They can text me. No. If that port-a-potty isn't
[38:27.770 --> 38:33.530]  there. It's 2021. I'm not doing this like it's 1965. They can text me. It could be a landline.
[38:34.350 --> 38:40.390]  I don't think a lot of freight companies are there on mobiles. Really? Really, you don't?
[38:40.490 --> 38:47.570]  They've probably got an HQ with some 65-year-old bloke on the phone. Okay. I don't understand how
[38:47.570 --> 38:53.810]  I'm in trouble because some fucking dipshit hillbilly freight company can't figure out
[38:53.810 --> 38:57.970]  how to get to my house. No, it's not that. They need to organize for you to get it. No,
[38:58.010 --> 39:01.090]  it's not where they don't fucking know where you live. They know where you live. You need to be
[39:01.090 --> 39:05.930]  there to receive it. I don't have to be here to receive it. Yes, you do. It's mainly that you're
[39:05.930 --> 39:12.070]  not only dodging the port-a-potty, you're dodging content. I'm not dodging content. That's what I'm
[39:12.070 --> 39:17.090]  so ashamed of. That's why I didn't think Geoff would ever do that. He is dodging content. That's
[39:17.090 --> 39:22.170]  where I get it. Talk to Eric about this. I thought Geoff would never do that. Regardless of the
[39:22.170 --> 39:27.610]  inconvenience, this is content and Geoff wouldn't skip that. That goes against everything he stands
[39:27.610 --> 39:34.810]  for. You're breaking your own personal code, Geoff. I just realized what I'm going to do with
[39:34.810 --> 39:42.590]  this port-a-potty when I get it. Yeah? What's that? Well, when I receive the content in my front yard,
[39:43.550 --> 39:50.250]  I'm then going to make sure that nobody else dodges that content by sending it on a journey
[39:50.250 --> 39:55.010]  to everybody's house. So Nick will get it next. I have Nick's address. Nick will get it next,
[39:55.010 --> 39:58.690]  then I'll send it to Eric's house for a while until he gets sick of it because I do know where
[39:58.690 --> 40:01.930]  Eric lives because I have his address, and then I'll leave it at Gavin's house and then he can
[40:01.930 --> 40:07.810]  figure it out. So you're going to collect them as well? I'll call. I'll get the... I'll get the...
[40:07.810 --> 40:12.450]  I'll tell you what. When the people show up to drop it off, I'll get their land line number
[40:12.450 --> 40:17.230]  and I'll call them back and I'll say, hey, I got a pickup at Eric Baudour's house. Can you take
[40:17.230 --> 40:21.490]  it over to Gavin Frese's house? And he'll be like, aye, aye, captain. It's 1962 over here still.
[40:21.490 --> 40:28.270]  We'll do it. I don't... I like this. You're right. You're right. I like this. I hope I don't... I
[40:28.270 --> 40:33.590]  mean, I hope I... I just hope that the next time they call, I'm... I'm not in... I'm in a place
[40:33.590 --> 40:37.370]  where I can answer it. I'll get you the number. And that we can end up having the conversation
[40:37.370 --> 40:42.330]  and then that we can get this worked out because I am excited about the future of this porta potty
[40:42.330 --> 40:47.690]  and the journey it's about to take. Do you have your dolly, your hand truck ready? I do have it
[40:47.690 --> 40:54.150]  ready. The tires are flat, but I will air them up. All right. Pretty good. I hope Eric and Nick
[40:54.150 --> 41:00.190]  have got theirs ready too. Gavin, you'll need one as well. I could probably throw it in the
[41:00.190 --> 41:08.590]  back of Emily's car or SUV and take it to you, Gav. That's a good point. Thanks, Andrew. You're
[41:08.590 --> 41:12.650]  right. This is going to be good content. We already talked about this. If this comes around
[41:12.650 --> 41:18.930]  on me, I know it wasn't intentional. I know it wasn't your aim, but that's going to mean,
[41:19.470 --> 41:23.710]  you know, that might mean a change of my path through this story. Yeah, I don't know what
[41:23.710 --> 41:28.470]  that means. What does that even mean? You might get some collateral, you know, splashback
[41:28.970 --> 41:34.130]  from my end. Oh, I'm fully prepared. See, I expected Geoff to take the porta potty and then
[41:34.130 --> 41:38.730]  come back at me for some reason, even though it's a great gift. I expect a retaliation. What I never
[41:38.730 --> 41:45.170]  anticipated is Geoff just running from content. That's what shocked me. It sounds to me like I'm
[41:45.170 --> 41:50.870]  running towards content. You are now. It just keeps missing me. I feel like Geoff has salad
[41:50.870 --> 41:58.610]  creamed the porta potty. Yeah, but salad cream was five dollars in a grocery store. This is a
[41:58.610 --> 42:04.710]  one thousand dollar purchase. Most expensive gift I've ever given anybody. Well, it doesn't matter,
[42:04.710 --> 42:10.050]  Andrew, because I've got the sequel to Salad Cream for you. OK, you said last week that you
[42:10.050 --> 42:16.670]  were open to pickles. No. What? No, I'm not open to pickles. OK, you've closed. What does that mean?
[42:16.810 --> 42:22.310]  You close? No, no, no, no, no. I was open to the concept of things being pickled. Right. I never
[42:22.310 --> 42:28.890]  said I was open to pickles. Whatever. That still works. Have you heard of Branston pickle? No.
[42:29.390 --> 42:33.550]  OK, so to me, when when you're talking about pickles, like a pickle cucumber that you find
[42:33.550 --> 42:38.810]  in a burger and that to me, that's like an American style cucumber that I would call a gherkin.
[42:39.250 --> 42:47.090]  Like in a Big Mac, you got gherkin in there. To me, pickle is like a brown paste that you get out
[42:47.090 --> 42:53.650]  of a jar. And that is your next salad cream. Excuse me? I want you to buy. Let me get a picture of it
[42:53.650 --> 42:59.510]  for you. So we're on the same page. OK, but like I don't like pickles. Right. But you like pickled
[42:59.510 --> 43:06.070]  onion. OK, what does it taste like? So this what this is, is if you open this jar, you will be
[43:06.070 --> 43:14.390]  greeted to a brown sort of slimy goo with very small chunks of pickled onion in there. And what
[43:14.390 --> 43:20.130]  you're going to do, Andrew, you're going to spread that onto a sandwich, maybe with a bit of cheese
[43:20.130 --> 43:25.250]  in there. So maybe like a cheese and pickle sandwich. Hard cheese or soft cheese? Hard.
[43:25.250 --> 43:32.510]  Probably if you want my opinion, I'd go for some a nice chunk of British sharp cheddar and smear
[43:32.510 --> 43:38.010]  some of that on top. And that is a textbook British sandwich. So all the British people
[43:38.010 --> 43:41.470]  right now, they're like licking their lips. They're like, oh, he's describing the perfect
[43:41.470 --> 43:45.170]  British sandwich. Like they all know they all know what you're talking about. I think they'll
[43:45.170 --> 43:49.710]  know what I'm talking about. I think it is quite a polarizing thing. I wasn't a fan of it until my
[43:49.710 --> 43:57.590]  20s. I've always avoided Branson pickle. Pickle in general. Is the consistency of Branson pickle,
[43:57.690 --> 44:03.290]  is it sort of like Vegemite or is it more like jelly? It's like it's got chunks, like it's
[44:03.290 --> 44:09.750]  crunchy. So it's like preserves. It's all in like a brown gunk. Nothing about that sounds appealing
[44:09.750 --> 44:13.610]  or interesting. What's it taste like? Tastes pretty good, actually. It's definitely an acquired taste
[44:13.610 --> 44:18.790]  for me. Does it taste like pickles? Like your pickles? Like, I'm sorry, like our American
[44:18.790 --> 44:25.030]  gherkin pickles? No. Well, there's no cucumber in it. It's onion, I think. Is that the fucking,
[44:25.470 --> 44:28.910]  is that the sushi container? Yeah, that's the sushi. That's what took me down.
[44:29.350 --> 44:33.690]  That was the remnants. You can see the rib top left. It looks like a foot went through it. I can
[44:33.690 --> 44:38.610]  see the corners ripped. Yeah, I know. Yeah, that reminds me, before we started the show, you were
[44:38.610 --> 44:42.510]  saying something about being all hopped up on painkillers. Yeah, what happened? Oh yeah, my
[44:42.510 --> 44:50.230]  ankle exploded. Andrew texted me earlier. Like the shitty bathroom at the Vans? No, not that bad,
[44:50.290 --> 44:55.170]  but like bad. He texted me earlier, he said, he just wrote, one of your favorite comedic things
[44:55.170 --> 44:59.530]  happened. And I was, I read that, I thought about it for a few minutes, I just replied,
[45:00.070 --> 45:04.830]  you rolled an ankle? And he replied, blew it out. What does that mean? What does that mean?
[45:05.350 --> 45:11.230]  It means my ankle kind of exploded. Because last week, your ankle was,
[45:11.790 --> 45:16.250]  it was in good shape. It was your back, I think, that was the problem. We were discussing,
[45:16.570 --> 45:23.910]  we were discussing the marathon. Yeah. Yeah. No, I was excited about it. I was ready. I was
[45:23.910 --> 45:28.730]  feeling like the marathon was going to happen. Then, you know, I get made fun of. I get teased
[45:28.730 --> 45:34.650]  for the fact that I keep so many things in my room. At the Waffle Maker, I have a Keurig still next to
[45:34.650 --> 45:39.010]  my bed. I was just walking to the kitchen. And then all of a sudden, I had a sharp pain in my
[45:39.010 --> 45:44.730]  ankle. I thought that's not good. Took a few steps, still hurt. Six hours later, whole ankle
[45:44.730 --> 45:50.930]  swollen. Just the entire thing. Entire ankle fucking just twisted in every angle. I was up
[45:50.930 --> 45:56.810]  until 5am, just rolling constantly saying, nowhere is good. Nowhere is comfortable. No matter what
[45:56.810 --> 46:03.630]  position my foot is in, radiating pain. Just the absolute worst. You somehow have these colossal
[46:03.630 --> 46:10.090]  injuries that don't have a story. No. It's just like the anti-ankle story. Yeah. Yet somehow,
[46:10.650 --> 46:16.270]  you're completely immobilized. What happened? I just walk into the kitchen, which is what...
[46:16.790 --> 46:20.830]  I'm scared now. I'm scared to go in that kitchen. I was just walking there. And then all of a sudden,
[46:20.870 --> 46:26.390]  I did something to my foot. And now I can't walk. I can't stand. Oh, it's bad. It's a bad injury.
[46:26.730 --> 46:32.630]  You know what it is? What? Go ahead. I do know what it is. And it's unfortunate. I think you were a
[46:32.630 --> 46:40.350]  real legendary piece of shit in a previous life. And you are paying karma for some previous version
[46:40.350 --> 46:45.350]  of you. And it's totally unfair because you're a decent dude. But the old you, like the previous
[46:45.350 --> 46:52.230]  Andrew, must have been a real shithead. Yeah. I mean, that's viable, I guess. We're now potentially
[46:52.230 --> 46:57.350]  months out from the marathon again. No, I don't think it'll be that bad, although I'm on a lot
[46:57.350 --> 47:01.350]  of painkillers right now. So maybe I'm underestimating. I'm hiding. The pain is being
[47:01.350 --> 47:06.230]  What percentage of painkillers taken throughout your life have gone to the ankle area?
[47:06.670 --> 47:15.790]  Oh, 90% easily. Solid 90. I'd say I've taken more for ankle injuries than I have like a headache,
[47:16.110 --> 47:23.110]  without a doubt. I'm like, I'm like Achilles, but everything's bad and the ankles are just worse,
[47:23.230 --> 47:27.850]  like reverse Achilles. How do you do anything? I don't understand. It can just give out at
[47:27.850 --> 47:33.870]  any time for no reason. I think I must. Maybe I heard it in the fall, the sushi fall, and it's
[47:33.870 --> 47:38.730]  just been hanging by a thread. And then I just did an angle like the back pain was delayed. So
[47:38.730 --> 47:43.830]  maybe the ankle was on an even longer delay. I think so. Yeah, that's a great point. But yeah,
[47:43.870 --> 47:48.610]  not good. You need surgery, I think. I don't think it's a surgery. I don't know. I'm not.
[47:48.670 --> 47:54.310]  What else would it be? I don't know. It's not sustainable. Get an x-ray. It's not. But I don't
[47:54.310 --> 47:58.330]  think it needs. It's not like I broke anything. It's just like a tendon thing. I've always had
[47:58.330 --> 48:05.170]  bad ankles. Couldn't skate for shit. It was bad. Not a great skater. Listen, man, I've always had
[48:05.170 --> 48:10.810]  bad ankles. So like, that's the way to go through life. You're not getting any younger. It's only
[48:10.810 --> 48:16.070]  going to get worse. You should you should fix it now. Do physical therapy or whatever. Yeah,
[48:16.070 --> 48:21.690]  there's still time, Andrew. Don't give up on your ankles. Envision a life where you can roll over on
[48:21.690 --> 48:25.870]  the left side of your body and not sprain your ankle while you're sleeping. That should be
[48:25.870 --> 48:31.170]  possible. It's very rare. The ankle thing kind of recovered for a while and it's just been recently
[48:31.170 --> 48:36.230]  past three months, I guess. Two ankle injuries. This one won't be bad. I think this will be OK.
[48:36.770 --> 48:42.210]  It was just funny, like the the level of which it was swollen. It's like the whole whole every
[48:42.210 --> 48:46.890]  angle. It's like I pulled every muscle from every possible angle. So you just look like a tree stump
[48:46.890 --> 48:52.750]  from the knee down. Yeah, but it's like a bumpy tree stump. It's like you're trying to feel out
[48:52.750 --> 48:59.530]  a word or something. It goes up and down. Like there's braille inside your leg. Yeah, it's like
[48:59.530 --> 49:04.370]  braille. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. Yeah, that's my ankle. Yeah, it's not great,
[49:04.450 --> 49:08.850]  but well, fine. Maybe don't go to the kitchen for a while. That's what I'm saying. Sounds
[49:08.850 --> 49:15.250]  pretty dangerous. It is. Yeah. Keurig on next to your bed is such a good idea. I'd still recommend
[49:15.250 --> 49:19.770]  that you have carpet in your bedroom. No, I do not. I think I think you could do with more carpet.
[49:19.870 --> 49:25.310]  I think that will soften things for you. Less. No. Well, maybe less slipping, but I don't know.
[49:25.510 --> 49:31.410]  Carpet. I'm not a fan. Are you still cooking with your Keurig? Yeah. Yeah. Ramen. Yeah. How many
[49:31.410 --> 49:36.690]  how many meals a day would you say you eat through the Keurig? Not often. Many meals per day. I will
[49:36.690 --> 49:41.450]  say I've made more ramen significantly than I have made coffee using my Keurig machine. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:41.450 --> 49:48.510]  Without a doubt. Would you say that the Keurig company is potentially even like misadvertising
[49:49.090 --> 49:52.010]  and missing a whole a whole market that they don't understand?
[49:52.470 --> 49:57.450]  They should definitely be promoting it for sure. Yeah. I'd say ramen number one,
[49:57.910 --> 50:02.590]  number two, hot chocolate and then very distant coffee. I don't think I've made a coffee since
[50:02.590 --> 50:07.790]  we did the show. I'm sure they could make a nice big fat slot that you could put in a slab of ramen
[50:07.790 --> 50:15.790]  and it would slowly dispense out. That's a brilliant idea. You just load like a PEZ dispenser.
[50:16.050 --> 50:21.710]  You just load a ramen cartridge in and then you basically get like enough ramen that it looks like
[50:21.710 --> 50:28.310]  a full loaf of bread and you just stack them in and it just dispenses. Oh my god. Dibs, we got
[50:28.310 --> 50:33.070]  that. Registered trademark. That's a f*** face. That's a f*** face. F*** face trademark. See,
[50:33.150 --> 50:37.270]  the thing is there's a reason that hasn't been made yet. And usually you can sort of think
[50:37.270 --> 50:42.310]  forwardly towards why that is. I don't know why that wouldn't work. Yeah, everybody said that,
[50:42.470 --> 50:47.790]  but they said that about the meat bracelet. But in three years, you won't be able to go
[50:47.790 --> 50:51.750]  to Town Lake without watching people eat meat while they're jogging down the f***ing trail.
[50:53.210 --> 50:59.330]  You'll see. Maybe like the ramen-y crumbs would eventually... I don't know. I think that could
[50:59.330 --> 51:03.690]  work. Oh wait, how does it disperse? Like do you put it in a container and then pull it out or?
[51:03.690 --> 51:07.690]  I imagine you would stack up, you'd stack your ramen, they would be stacked on and you press
[51:07.690 --> 51:13.330]  like one or two and it would just go and it would fall into the machine into a chamber full of
[51:13.330 --> 51:16.690]  boiling water and it would sit in there for a while and then it would dispense through a little
[51:16.690 --> 51:22.130]  nozzle as loose flowing ramen. I don't want loose flowing ramen. That doesn't sound good. What do
[51:22.130 --> 51:27.450]  you mean? Here's what it looks like. It's how you eat it. No, I don't. You load the ramen in like
[51:27.450 --> 51:32.530]  it's a VCR, right? And then you shut it. Yeah. And then you hit a button and then it makes a little
[51:32.530 --> 51:37.590]  noise. And then two minutes later, you know how you've seen how like when people pull pasta out
[51:37.590 --> 51:41.690]  when they're rolling pasta, it looks like that. It just kind of bubbles out that just kind of
[51:41.690 --> 51:48.430]  drops down into a bowl with a liquid. And I assume instead of a pouch of the flavor, instead of like
[51:48.430 --> 51:53.850]  individual pouches per ramen, you would just have like a internal canister full of that stuff and
[51:53.850 --> 51:58.070]  you can pick the flavor as you're putting the noodles through and it would just apply it. Yeah,
[51:58.070 --> 52:04.930]  or the the noodles come pre-treated with their flavor even maybe. Yeah. Okay. I just I don't like
[52:04.930 --> 52:09.750]  the idea of having ramen out of a nozzle. That just seems upsetting to me. Why not? It just
[52:09.750 --> 52:14.090]  seems upsetting. There's nothing appealing about that to me in any way that just seems bad. I
[52:14.090 --> 52:18.950]  wouldn't want that. You have a waffle in a bottle. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but I don't even know if we
[52:18.950 --> 52:22.810]  can call that a waffle at this point. Although I thought, should I try to cook that? Just out of
[52:22.810 --> 52:29.230]  curiosity. What would that turn out like? Before this episode ends, I wanted to ask Eric how budget
[52:29.230 --> 52:35.430]  conversations went. No, there have been people that have reached out and we will be getting more
[52:35.430 --> 52:40.570]  budget in the coming weeks. Don't worry about it right now. And this also isn't pertinent to anyone
[52:40.570 --> 52:44.390]  listening that they would need to know anything about this. No, it is. It is because we had the
[52:44.390 --> 52:49.310]  conversation, our behind-the-scenes conversation in front of the audience. Yeah, I agree. And that's
[52:49.310 --> 52:55.110]  the only time that needs to happen. Oh, so it only needs to happen when it's a behind-the-scenes
[52:55.110 --> 52:58.870]  conversation in front of the audience. I see. Do you guys want to have a behind-the-scenes
[52:58.870 --> 53:03.150]  conversation in front of the audience right now? Yeah, sure. Okay. What's this thing about budget
[53:03.150 --> 53:07.430]  I keep hearing about? I don't know. I wasn't really listening. Yeah, what's up with that, Eric?
[53:09.970 --> 53:14.010]  Something about budget? I think we lost Eric. Yeah, I don't think you want to stun me. Andrew,
[53:14.090 --> 53:18.350]  I'm doing this for you. I'm making sure that all of the future port-a-potties that you send to
[53:18.350 --> 53:22.370]  Geoff's house, I'm making sure they don't come out of your pocket. Let me stop you right there before
[53:22.370 --> 53:27.270]  you continue. Don't say, when you send to Geoff's house. That's not what's happening here. Andrew
[53:27.270 --> 53:32.390]  might send them through my house, but they're not going to my house because they don't stay here.
[53:32.610 --> 53:39.710]  They go from my... Think of me as another warehouse. I receive the port-a-potty, and then I determine,
[53:40.010 --> 53:47.110]  does it go to Nick, Eric, or Gavin? Or maybe back to Andrew, if I want to pay international fees.
[53:47.110 --> 53:53.070]  I just wanted to make that distinction. It never came from Andrew. No. It wasn't a Canadian
[53:53.070 --> 53:58.650]  port-a-potty. No. Or maybe it will go to Andrew. Well, first you have to receive it. That's step
[53:58.650 --> 54:06.110]  one. Get that fucking port-a-potty. Give me a call, people. I posted a number. I think,
[54:06.210 --> 54:11.530]  at this point, we're in a different game where Geoff is seeing how long this port-a-potty can
[54:11.530 --> 54:17.410]  stay in limbo, which is also interesting. It's going to be real interesting when a fucking
[54:17.410 --> 54:24.750]  Armada port-a-potty show up. That's going to be great. Oh, what's this? A tracking number?
[54:25.250 --> 54:29.230]  That's the tracking. I gave you a number. I gave you a website. You have no excuses.
[54:30.930 --> 54:37.510]  You can't... I'm not... You can't make me work on your thing. Well, you refused to.
[54:37.930 --> 54:41.270]  I fucking refused to, Geoff. I'm right here. I'm right here, man.
[54:41.270 --> 54:44.810]  Call him. Do a simple thing. I can't. I'm doing a podcast.
[54:45.530 --> 54:50.850]  What do you mean you can't? This is hardly a podcast. To call this a podcast is very generous.
[54:51.330 --> 54:57.230]  I was getting grief in the other one because I said I don't know where Indiana is,
[54:57.410 --> 55:03.330]  and everyone pointed out that I've been there. I feel like that changes nothing. You can fly to
[55:03.330 --> 55:05.590]  a place and have no idea where it is, right? Absolutely.
[55:05.930 --> 55:09.850]  I've been to like 30 states. If you ask me to point where they all are, absolutely no idea.
[55:09.850 --> 55:13.110]  I'm not flying the plane. Do I need to know that? No, I agree with you.
[55:13.210 --> 55:18.690]  Also, it's like every single person... I'm going to guess it's Americans, you know,
[55:18.790 --> 55:23.970]  because Indiana is in America. And so I'm going to guess it's Americans making fun of you for
[55:23.970 --> 55:28.070]  not knowing where Indiana has been, even though they've been there. I bet you none of those
[55:28.070 --> 55:33.150]  motherfuckers can point to three cities on a map in England and say what they are. I'm sure if you
[55:33.150 --> 55:38.030]  were like, point to Nottingham, they'd be like... I'm sure if they've been to Nottingham, fine.
[55:38.030 --> 55:43.610]  But if they'd also been to 27 other cities in England, I don't think they would necessarily
[55:44.170 --> 55:46.870]  be able to point out where Bath is. Yeah.
[55:47.310 --> 55:49.150]  Or Ealing. Or Slough.
[55:49.670 --> 55:51.330]  Slough. Staines.
[55:51.530 --> 55:55.850]  Or East Farvenburg. Well, East Havermire.
[55:56.350 --> 55:57.650]  Yeah. Hull.
[55:58.150 --> 55:59.610]  Harvard. Farzenmar.
[56:01.290 --> 56:02.490]  Northern Nor North.
[56:02.690 --> 56:03.390]  Northern Nor North.
[56:04.410 --> 56:05.830]  Oh, those are old dumb jokes.
[56:06.450 --> 56:07.910]  Should we stop doing this podcast?
[56:07.910 --> 56:11.170]  I think we're good. We got to do another one, so end this.
[56:11.510 --> 56:13.530]  Andrew, do you need to pill up or anything before the next one?
[56:13.550 --> 56:14.310]  No, no, I'm good.
[56:14.670 --> 56:17.790]  Okay. Well, this is the end of that podcast, then.
[56:18.330 --> 56:21.330]  Oh, it trailed off. It ended on quite low energy, didn't it?
[56:21.610 --> 56:22.270]  Oh. What do you mean?
[56:23.470 --> 56:24.970]  No, I can see how you would say that.
[56:25.990 --> 56:28.210]  How would you like to rectify that?
[56:28.350 --> 56:32.270]  No, I agree. It ended on low energy, but we want the openings to also have low energy,
[56:32.410 --> 56:35.410]  so isn't that a bookend for both things? Or is that too low?
[56:35.410 --> 56:37.830]  Maybe we go low and we end high.
[56:39.050 --> 56:42.970]  Okay. Well, you love it when you go high, so please end this show on a high note, Geoff.
[56:43.230 --> 56:43.450]  Okay.
[56:44.150 --> 56:48.030]  Hey, man, thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[56:48.670 --> 56:54.510]  This has been Geoff and Andrew and Gavin, the baby Raymond, and Nick did the editing
[56:54.510 --> 56:59.490]  and did the sound, and Eric did nothing but be grumpy because we asked him about his job
[56:59.490 --> 57:02.030]  and he doesn't want to talk about it. And he's all like, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.
[57:02.030 --> 57:06.710]  And hopefully you liked it, and you laughed, and maybe it even caused you to think a little
[57:06.710 --> 57:10.610]  bit about something different. And if you're the porta potty guy, give me a call. I'm here
[57:10.610 --> 57:14.970]  right now. I'll answer if I can. And although I get pretty busy pretty fast, so maybe I can't.
[57:15.030 --> 57:15.470]  I don't know.
[57:15.530 --> 57:17.570]  You sound like Jack. You sound like Jack.
[57:17.890 --> 57:18.670]  What does that mean?
[57:19.010 --> 57:20.090]  It just sounded like Jack.
[57:20.650 --> 57:22.090]  You just interrupted the outro, Eric.
[57:22.270 --> 57:25.630]  I'm sorry. It was just like, really like, I didn't know if it was like,
[57:26.430 --> 57:28.270]  on purpose. It was just like, really at me.
[57:28.270 --> 57:28.550]  You're right.
[57:28.930 --> 57:29.150]  Yeah.
[57:29.530 --> 57:31.510]  I was trying to start low to work high.
[57:32.030 --> 57:35.570]  So I could build it up. And I feel like you just totally cut that off.
[57:36.330 --> 57:39.190]  I mean, you could take the torch. You could continue at Geoff's energy level and go...
[57:39.190 --> 57:40.130]  Can we just end this?
[57:40.290 --> 57:44.850]  Hey, thank you for listening to the podcast. I think you guys did a great job.
[57:45.130 --> 57:50.490]  Great podcast, 44. Stay tuned, 45. See you next time. Is that good?
[57:51.050 --> 57:51.570]  Yeah, that was good.
[57:52.110 --> 57:52.750]  Ended medium.
[57:53.010 --> 57:53.670]  Okay, cool. Thank you.
[57:53.910 --> 57:55.010]  Yeah, it's over.
[57:55.490 --> 57:56.910]  I don't think that's what I did, but fine.
