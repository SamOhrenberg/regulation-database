[01:09.400 --> 01:15.360]  Hello and welcome to episode 45 of F*** Face. My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always
[01:15.360 --> 01:22.020]  Gavin Free and Andrew Pantin. And how's it going boys? I'm doing about as good as I was 10 minutes
[01:22.020 --> 01:28.960]  ago when we wrapped up the last one. Still good? Yeah. Gavin, what'd you get to eat? Is Gavin not
[01:28.960 --> 01:34.360]  back yet? Did we just assume Gavin was back? Did we start without Gavin? Did we? I thought he was
[01:34.360 --> 01:40.500]  there. I heard him much. I could have sworn Gavin was a part of the conversation earlier. Oh,
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.240]  shit. Are you good? Yeah. My headphones are off. I just heard a bunch of people saying my name
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.100]  through it. What's going on? What? Why were your headphones off and you're just sitting here? Why
[01:51.100 --> 01:55.480]  would you do that? I'll get a snack. I'll tell you, I didn't eat yet today. I'm gonna stuff it down.
[01:55.780 --> 01:59.700]  Gavin, Gavin, we're in the middle of the next episode. We just started the next episode. We
[01:59.700 --> 02:03.860]  thought you were here, man. We heard you talking. I thought we were still waiting for Andrew
[02:03.860 --> 02:10.440]  Steam Engine. No, I'm good to go. What are you eating? I'm just stuffing some crisps down. First of all,
[02:10.640 --> 02:16.060]  you're eating a meal. That's not a snack. You can't claim what are you eating. You're eating
[02:16.060 --> 02:23.420]  lunch. Crisps? Yeah. Okay, that's a snack. That's a snack. I had a bit of celery and some hummus,
[02:24.140 --> 02:29.460]  just topping it off with something crunchy, getting it down. What flavor? Flame-grilled
[02:29.460 --> 02:35.520]  steak flavor. What brand? McCoy's. Real McCoy's. Huh. I don't know if I'm familiar with that.
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.800]  They're employed. Flame-grilled seems like an unnecessary word for that product.
[02:40.380 --> 02:47.880]  Flame-grilled steak? You're gonna fucking serve sous-vide flavored steak? Why is it flame-grilled?
[02:48.260 --> 02:53.260]  Yeah, I know what you mean. That's like Burger King's whole deal, right? It's flame-broiled.
[02:53.700 --> 02:58.120]  I think it's just that, like, when you go to McDonald's, for instance, or like, I can't say
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.260]  I never worked at McDonald's, but I did work at Sidney's Fried Chicken. And on that, you just cook
[03:02.260 --> 03:08.280]  your patties on, uh, just like a flat oven that's heated, right? So there's no, it's not touching
[03:08.280 --> 03:14.140]  any actual flames, so you don't get like the little, I guess, like the burnt edges. You know what I mean?
[03:14.440 --> 03:20.020]  Yeah. So this is the second episode of a back-to-back. Last time I said, next time we record,
[03:20.100 --> 03:24.680]  if that port-a-potty is not there, there will be consequences to pay. We're doing back-to-back
[03:24.680 --> 03:29.140]  recordings. That does not apply here. So it will be the next recording on this one that that
[03:29.140 --> 03:34.640]  port-a-potty better have touched your hands. I don't care if it's in Gavin's yard by the time
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.940]  that we're talking. You have received the port-a-potty is what has happened. And that brings
[03:39.940 --> 03:45.080]  me to something I want to talk about. I'm assembling, we're assembling a group to help with
[03:45.080 --> 03:52.700]  bits, Geoff. An army will be pointed at you if this does not occur. I've made an email called
[03:52.700 --> 03:59.120]  effacebits at gmail.com. I have ambitious ideas for things that require help. If you're listening
[03:59.120 --> 04:02.760]  and you want to contribute to these, if you doesn't really matter what your skill set is,
[04:02.780 --> 04:08.000]  or maybe you just even know somebody that has a specific skill set or is helpful in some capacity,
[04:08.500 --> 04:14.500]  feel free to email at effacebits at gmail.com. I'm going to make a spreadsheet and note what
[04:14.500 --> 04:19.120]  everybody says that they can claim to do. And we're going to mobilize against you, Geoff.
[04:20.440 --> 04:25.300]  So I'm just, that'll probably be the first thing. So hopefully, I really hope, I'd love for you to
[04:25.300 --> 04:30.440]  receive the port-a-potty. And I'm hoping you do. How can my own podcast and audience mobilize
[04:30.440 --> 04:36.600]  against me? Also, this was tweeted before the last recording. Yeah, this was tweeted this morning.
[04:36.700 --> 04:39.940]  I was going to mention it last show, but then I thought, well, Geoff is doing this. So it would
[04:39.940 --> 04:43.820]  make sense that this is the last opportunity before the squad mobilizes against you.
[04:43.820 --> 04:50.160]  We'll come from all angles. So wait a minute. Is the point of the squad to be anti-me?
[04:50.580 --> 04:54.180]  No, no, no, no, no, no. You've just crossed the line. You've broken your own code. But isn't it
[04:54.180 --> 05:00.500]  also my squad as much as yours or Gavin's? Yeah, but you have, you've crossed the code here. Can
[05:00.500 --> 05:05.880]  I just turn around and mobilize them back against you? Yeah, you could, but you don't have the
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.340]  fucking password to the email account. So I got that going for me. Geoff, you don't have to make
[05:10.340 --> 05:15.240]  your own one. Hey, Andrew, can I ask you a question? Go ahead. Can I get the password to
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.700]  that email account? We'll talk about it. Maybe if you're at the porta potty, I'll gladly share it
[05:19.700 --> 05:25.200]  as soon as that thing gets there. Look, man, it's not my fault. They won't bring it to my house.
[05:25.200 --> 05:31.280]  It's your fault. I've been here the whole time. You're ignoring their calls. We've already done
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.320]  this. We don't need to do this again. So just let me repeat that one more time. That's effacebits
[05:37.220 --> 05:43.780]  at gmail.com. Any skill at all. I don't care if you just happen to if you're somebody's dentist
[05:43.780 --> 05:48.500]  that could be of interest. Doesn't matter. Just if you can help in any way and you want to,
[05:48.860 --> 05:52.680]  feel free to email. I'll put you in the spreadsheet. I might reach out to you
[05:52.680 --> 05:56.980]  if there's something we can do. Hey, if you're in the audience, if you're in the face audience,
[05:57.080 --> 06:01.000]  first off, thanks. Appreciate that. Yeah, absolutely. Good on you. That was cool of you.
[06:01.040 --> 06:05.520]  We owe you owe you one for that favor. But if you're in the face audience currently and you're
[06:05.520 --> 06:10.320]  listening to this and considering sending an email to that address to Andrew, I would just
[06:10.320 --> 06:14.860]  like you to consider that you don't know what he's going to do with this information and mobilize
[06:14.860 --> 06:19.460]  against you. How well can you really trust? How well can any of us really trust Andrew? I'd like
[06:19.460 --> 06:23.580]  you to think about that before you just send an email that could be used. Who knows what kind of
[06:23.580 --> 06:28.040]  personal information he might be stealing from you, data mining from you. I don't know. I just
[06:28.040 --> 06:32.280]  want you to think before you hit send on that email. Think to yourself, do I even know his real
[06:32.280 --> 06:38.160]  name? First of all, I don't know why that would even matter as an initial response. And secondly,
[06:38.760 --> 06:43.700]  once again, Geoff, this is your squad, too. It's just it's not my fault that you have crossed us
[06:43.700 --> 06:48.520]  and you've made this wrong turn. This is for the betterment of everybody. It's just because you
[06:48.520 --> 06:54.120]  broke your own code that this is currently being a good. Yeah, you did. I'm sad about it. I don't
[06:54.120 --> 06:58.900]  know, Andrew. I feel like dodging that port-a-potty. Your words, not mine. They were your
[06:58.900 --> 07:03.760]  words, literally your words in a meeting yesterday. Well, that's your your words that they were my
[07:03.760 --> 07:09.600]  words. My words and Eric backed it up. That's what you said. Well, I think we all I think we all know
[07:09.600 --> 07:15.420]  Eric's a little suspect when it comes to trustworthiness. Whose relationships have been
[07:15.420 --> 07:20.880]  mostly the most affected by this podcast? Because I feel like my relationship with Andrew is much
[07:20.880 --> 07:26.280]  stronger than when we started. However, I feel like Andrew's relationship with Geoff has deteriorated
[07:26.280 --> 07:32.860]  somewhat dramatically. No, I disagree. I think you're onto something. I disagree. I feel like
[07:32.860 --> 07:39.360]  Andrew and I were much closer before. No, I disagree strongly. I'd be willing to say Eric
[07:39.360 --> 07:45.000]  and Geoff have also deteriorated. My relationship with you? No, with Eric. Oh, with Eric. I don't
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.280]  know that I would consider what Eric and I had before to be a relationship. I think it's as
[07:49.280 --> 07:55.840]  strong as ever. Really? Oh, thanks buddy. You seem mad more. No, that's just by nature of the work I do.
[07:55.840 --> 08:01.780]  Okay. So there we are. I think I cleared it. ffacebits at gmail.com. Yeah, I think we're good.
[08:02.180 --> 08:06.340]  Feel free to email. Anytime you reach out to a stranger on the internet, you should think about
[08:06.340 --> 08:09.440]  it first. That's all I'm saying. Safety first. We're going to do some cool stuff. Safety first.
[08:09.620 --> 08:13.040]  We're going to do some amazing things. Sure. You know what? We can talk about that. Child
[08:13.040 --> 08:18.240]  Kicker. The short film. I'm working on that. I'm putting the Child Kicker short together.
[08:18.760 --> 08:24.020]  What? Yeah. I talked about this like two weeks ago. You wanted to put it in a film festival?
[08:24.020 --> 08:27.940]  Yeah, I want to fucking make a Child Kicker short. We're going to submit it to festivals.
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.300]  I don't know how you missed that. I talked about that not like the last time we recorded over a
[08:33.300 --> 08:38.340]  week ago. Yeah, I said I wanted to work on it. Yeah, he did. In passing, I confirmed Gavin and
[08:38.340 --> 08:42.920]  I sorted kind of a thing out. We're going to get a scene from Gavin in Child Kicker. It's going to
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.720]  be this piece of shit short that's going to have one scene that's filmed with an absurdly expensive
[08:47.720 --> 08:54.160]  camera. Does Vancouver Island have a festival? I'm sure they do. I'm sure they do. But I want to
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.600]  submit it to Sundance. I don't know what I have to do to do that, but I'm just going to submit
[08:58.600 --> 09:07.100]  everything. Is the Vancouver Child Kicker shirt out yet? That's a great question as well. Are the
[09:07.100 --> 09:11.680]  stickers out? Should we talk about the Child Kicker franchise as a whole? I feel like...
[09:11.680 --> 09:17.040]  That shirt is badass. It's a great shirt. We all agree that the Vancouver Child Kicker
[09:17.040 --> 09:24.200]  as an IP has a lot of leg. Oh, definitely. For sure. This is like... I'm seeing trilogy.
[09:24.840 --> 09:29.340]  This is like... Yeah, franchise. Yeah, this is like... If Robert Rodriguez got a hold of it,
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.340]  it would be like nine movies. It would. Yeah. And that's, you know, moving away from being
[09:33.340 --> 09:39.360]  pointed at Geoff. That's the type of thing I'd love to use the effacebits at gmail.com account for.
[09:39.660 --> 09:44.720]  Yeah. Certain ideas that I, you know, I can't pull off, but would just be amazing. Are you
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.420]  directing, by the way? I think producing is probably a better title for that. I'm trying
[09:50.420 --> 09:54.640]  to put everything together. How much actual, like, filming I'm going to do? I don't think a lot.
[09:54.920 --> 09:58.580]  So you're going to hire different location directors, I guess? I, you know, I don't even
[09:58.580 --> 10:03.360]  know if hire is the right word. We'll figure it out. I have more. I'm not an idea. Maybe get Michael
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.260]  Bay to do some. Yeah. Yeah. You know, well, I mean, you're attached. Why not? Things are limitless
[10:09.260 --> 10:15.160]  as far as this is going to be SAG or how are we doing? No, I think we're going to go none. I don't
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.340]  know. I'd have to look into that once again. Like these are things I need to. I'm not a fine ideas
[10:19.340 --> 10:24.860]  guy. I'm like a broad, like, let's we're going to do these things. I want a song like we're doing
[10:24.860 --> 10:28.940]  all the major stops of like movies. Yeah. Movies always have an original song. I'll be looking for
[10:28.940 --> 10:33.980]  that. Speaking of songs, how fucking cool was that? Oh, Geoffrey Boy song that they made.
[10:33.980 --> 10:37.580]  One second. I'm getting a call from Texas right now.
[10:39.020 --> 10:41.860]  Is about to be rerouted back to Indiana. Hello.
[10:43.420 --> 10:46.980]  Okay. It's the free company. Geoffrey.
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.360]  Has he been ignoring the calls? Have you tried to reach him and he hasn't been
[10:53.360 --> 10:59.440]  responsive? Could you tell me the number and I can have him call you immediately.
[11:01.620 --> 11:05.620]  So perfect. Thank you so much.
[11:07.720 --> 11:24.240]  Okay, so for the tracking 721-339-277-726-234-422-396-4327-530.
[11:25.700 --> 11:30.020]  This is great. I'm so glad this is happening right now.
[11:30.020 --> 11:34.860]  888-245-1162. Okay. I think I got it. Sorry,
[11:34.960 --> 11:41.260]  since people are talking in the background. 396-37-344-686.
[11:41.620 --> 11:45.420]  Okay. Thank you so much. I'll have him call you immediately. He was very accusatory. He was
[11:45.420 --> 11:48.100]  immediately saying that you were ignoring. Okay. Thank you. Have a great day.
[11:49.640 --> 11:53.000]  Okay, Geoff. Thanks, buddy. You're up. There you go. Yeah.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.160]  Yeah, there's your number. Thanks, man. I don't believe it. That was cool.
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.200]  Geoff, we can wait. We're very early into this podcast. We'll wait while you make this call.
[12:00.320 --> 12:03.020]  Yeah, you need to call them. Call them right fucking now.
[12:03.320 --> 12:06.820]  It turns out content is not easily dodged on Facebook.
[12:07.320 --> 12:09.840]  No. Okay, hold on, hold on.
[12:10.200 --> 12:13.900]  Tracking number just to make it even really easy for you. That's the fucking tracking number. The
[12:13.900 --> 12:17.980]  first one's the phone number. I love this podcast.
[12:19.220 --> 12:21.420]  Unbelievable. What are the chances they would call you
[12:21.420 --> 12:24.340]  right as we're in a recording? Yeah, it's fucking crazy.
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.320]  They just happen to be done with Geoff's shit as we're making an episode.
[12:28.700 --> 12:32.680]  We'll obviously have to bleep the numbers, but that was some good. That was a good bit.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.680]  He was annoyed with me because Geoff was fucking...
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.780]  Were you listening to Geoff as you were listening to him?
[12:37.860 --> 12:40.760]  Well, I had my headphones in. Yeah. And then Geoff just started saying numbers
[12:40.760 --> 12:44.100]  on the wrong tracking, so I had to knock my headphones off. And he was not
[12:44.100 --> 12:48.340]  thrilled when it took me like five times to write down the full tracking.
[12:49.040 --> 12:50.960]  Do you not like annoying people like that?
[12:52.540 --> 12:56.820]  No, I felt bad. Yeah, you did sound remorseful.
[12:56.900 --> 12:59.500]  Oh, yeah, I was genuine. You know, it's not my fault.
[12:59.900 --> 13:02.960]  He doesn't know. No, he has no idea.
[13:03.620 --> 13:08.420]  Yeah. My name is Geoff Ramsey. I received a call from this number about a freight delivery.
[13:11.020 --> 13:16.000]  Definitely not able to pick it up. Unfortunately, I'm out of town next week,
[13:16.020 --> 13:19.740]  but I could receive it the following week. I don't hear anything anymore.
[13:19.740 --> 13:22.340]  I'm not even sure that other one is a real address, honestly.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.900]  Is the address wrong? No, the address isn't wrong.
[13:24.920 --> 13:26.460]  All right. Sounds great. Thank you.
[13:27.800 --> 13:29.680]  Yeah, genius. The address was wrong.
[13:30.220 --> 13:33.640]  I got the address from you and you didn't give it to him properly.
[13:33.960 --> 13:34.380]  What do you mean?
[13:34.840 --> 13:36.820]  Whose address did you just give it to?
[13:37.160 --> 13:40.000]  I sent it to me. No.
[13:40.260 --> 13:42.180]  What do you think? You just chose the address.
[13:42.580 --> 13:44.660]  What? No, you didn't. Geoff, you didn't do that.
[13:45.160 --> 13:47.140]  What? Why would I do that?
[13:47.140 --> 13:51.360]  Oh no, Andrew, this is disaster. He's not even gonna have to deal with the delivery.
[13:51.460 --> 13:53.380]  He's redirected it before it even arrived.
[13:53.780 --> 13:55.360]  That's crazy talk. Why would you do that?
[13:55.480 --> 13:57.200]  Why would I do that? That doesn't make any sense.
[13:57.400 --> 13:58.920]  Why wouldn't you just take the...
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.420]  He's diverted the content. He's not even avoiding the content. He rerouted content.
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.980]  That's not what happened at all. I think that you're jumping to conclusions.
[14:07.420 --> 14:08.620]  Why do you sound so smug?
[14:09.180 --> 14:11.020]  I don't know. Why do you?
[14:11.500 --> 14:13.240]  I'm not smug. I'm confused.
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.080]  I'm not smug. I'm confused. You're smug. You're confused.
[14:16.080 --> 14:16.960]  I'm both.
[14:19.620 --> 14:25.260]  No, he had my address wrong. He was gonna deliver it. I'll be honest, I don't even know
[14:25.260 --> 14:28.920]  it's a real address, what he had. I don't know where Andrew got that from, but it definitely
[14:28.920 --> 14:30.760]  was not my address. It is now.
[14:32.200 --> 14:35.860]  So Andrew just got it into Austin, but that was about as far as it could go.
[14:35.940 --> 14:39.500]  Yeah, he was gonna send it to a fucking fake address or somebody three blocks over.
[14:39.920 --> 14:42.280]  I got it from when you sent me the bat.
[14:43.060 --> 14:44.400]  Yeah, you probably read it wrong.
[14:44.400 --> 14:46.540]  Can you compare your notes?
[14:46.960 --> 14:48.260]  Andrew seems very upset about this.
[14:48.560 --> 14:49.260]  I am very upset.
[14:49.740 --> 14:53.400]  I talked to the dude on the phone in front of you guys.
[14:54.440 --> 14:57.480]  I coordinated. He's bringing it a week from Monday.
[14:58.300 --> 14:59.500]  So far away.
[14:59.720 --> 15:00.100]  I know.
[15:01.440 --> 15:03.220]  I told him I'm out of town next week.
[15:04.240 --> 15:05.520]  Are you not?
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.880]  Yeah, good point, Nick. He also thought the delivery guy or the guy receiving it was called
[15:12.880 --> 15:13.820]  George Ramsey.
[15:13.820 --> 15:14.720]  But it's true.
[15:15.920 --> 15:17.040]  That's not on me.
[15:17.380 --> 15:21.480]  You sent a port-a-potty to George Ramsey at a different address than mine.
[15:21.940 --> 15:25.160]  No, Andrew, you're not as good at this than I thought.
[15:25.460 --> 15:27.420]  Thank God I saved the bit.
[15:27.780 --> 15:28.260]  Oh, shit.
[15:28.520 --> 15:29.320]  No, this is bullshit.
[15:29.580 --> 15:31.900]  It would have just languished.
[15:32.320 --> 15:35.420]  Big ass pink port-a-potty would have just languished in some guy's yard.
[15:36.100 --> 15:37.600]  Seven fucking streets over.
[15:37.780 --> 15:38.740]  I would have never known.
[15:38.980 --> 15:39.880]  View your order.
[15:41.960 --> 15:43.000]  I am upset.
[15:43.820 --> 15:45.580]  This is an expensive gift for you, Geoff.
[15:46.220 --> 15:47.860]  And he's upset that he pissed off that guy.
[15:48.280 --> 15:53.600]  Yeah, while he's dealing with the damage he's doing to some poor old guy's sanity over there.
[15:54.540 --> 15:57.780]  Gavin, you know, one of the frustrating things about I'm going to let Andrew play with his
[15:57.780 --> 15:58.360]  tracking numbers.
[15:58.740 --> 16:02.140]  The one of the frustrating things about this podcast sometimes when we get stuck in these
[16:02.140 --> 16:05.340]  recording in advance things, which I that's my alarm.
[16:05.660 --> 16:08.500]  I do understand is my fault that we're having to record ahead next week.
[16:08.500 --> 16:16.140]  Yeah, but like we release a bit like like Meat Bracelet or the NFT and then or a Don
[16:16.140 --> 16:18.320]  Zimmer thing or a port-a-potty.
[16:18.460 --> 16:20.700]  And then it's so long before we can talk about it again.
[16:21.080 --> 16:23.260]  And then sometimes we get to talk about it again.
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.480]  But then we still the audience, because we're so far ahead, the audience hasn't hit yet.
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.480]  So we have like my point is, I have no idea what we should be referencing or talking about
[16:32.480 --> 16:32.800]  right now.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.660]  What would have landed with the audience?
[16:34.700 --> 16:35.400]  They might want us.
[16:35.400 --> 16:37.340]  They might be like fucking talk about that.
[16:37.700 --> 16:39.780]  And we're not talking about it because I don't know.
[16:40.040 --> 16:41.460]  Do I text you this?
[16:41.680 --> 16:44.240]  The last one that came out, I think.
[16:44.620 --> 16:45.740]  David, you know where Geoff lives?
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.020]  It's the like, I don't know.
[16:48.640 --> 16:50.840]  I think the one that just came out is the one you hated.
[16:51.500 --> 16:51.620]  Yeah.
[16:51.660 --> 16:55.040]  And then it caused you to go ape shit with Meat Bracelets.
[16:55.480 --> 17:00.140]  But it's like it's like I don't know if we ever like the Don Zimmer shirt came out.
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.020]  We don't we never talked about it.
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.860]  If it was a big deal or not.
[17:03.860 --> 17:07.320]  We never we don't know if I tried in Vancouver.
[17:07.320 --> 17:09.840]  A child kicker thing is a success.
[17:09.980 --> 17:12.160]  We don't know if I saw we might be millionaires.
[17:12.500 --> 17:17.320]  The NFT, my ham sandwich NFT might have taken off and it might be might have already
[17:17.320 --> 17:18.780]  it might be hanging in a gallery somewhere.
[17:18.940 --> 17:19.780]  And we don't even know.
[17:19.900 --> 17:20.600]  We're foolish.
[17:21.380 --> 17:22.340]  I just texted you, Geoff.
[17:22.380 --> 17:23.680]  That is my address.
[17:24.100 --> 17:25.620]  That's what was on the shipping information.
[17:25.960 --> 17:27.660]  That's not what the address he said out loud.
[17:27.980 --> 17:29.220]  Well, he also called you, George.
[17:29.360 --> 17:29.640]  So maybe.
[17:29.820 --> 17:30.540]  Yeah, I don't.
[17:30.640 --> 17:31.200]  I just don't think.
[17:31.380 --> 17:33.620]  And then when I corrected it, he said that's not the address.
[17:33.620 --> 17:34.420]  Well, you heard him.
[17:34.940 --> 17:36.640]  It sounded like an old guy on a landline.
[17:36.900 --> 17:37.360]  That's all I'm saying.
[17:39.040 --> 17:40.480]  How do you fuck that up?
[17:41.040 --> 17:41.400]  Okay.
[17:45.710 --> 17:47.210]  Why did you do this to me?
[17:47.530 --> 17:48.030]  How do I?
[17:48.250 --> 17:49.310]  How do I get this?
[17:49.450 --> 17:50.910]  Because you wanted a toilet.
[17:51.050 --> 17:52.630]  This is so long in the making.
[17:52.770 --> 17:52.970]  Yeah.
[17:53.070 --> 17:54.490]  Your pipes were broken.
[17:54.870 --> 17:55.690]  You're supposed to get this.
[17:55.890 --> 17:56.530]  Mine was pretty.
[17:56.670 --> 17:58.490]  I was pretty clear that I know you are.
[17:58.930 --> 18:02.510]  And I was like, please do not send me a porta potty over and over again.
[18:02.930 --> 18:03.910]  No, I don't remember that.
[18:04.430 --> 18:05.630]  I don't remember that at all.
[18:06.330 --> 18:07.090]  That was a real.
[18:07.670 --> 18:07.870]  Okay.
[18:07.950 --> 18:08.490]  I think we're good.
[18:08.590 --> 18:09.430]  I think it's next.
[18:09.590 --> 18:10.290]  Not this Monday.
[18:10.410 --> 18:11.810]  The following Monday.
[18:11.870 --> 18:12.610]  Yeah, apparently.
[18:13.390 --> 18:18.630]  Geoff, if you are an NFT millionaire, by the time this comes out, can we use some of that money for the budget?
[18:19.090 --> 18:19.410]  Yeah.
[18:20.090 --> 18:23.170]  Dude, if I'm an NFT millionaire, we're all NFT millionaires.
[18:26.190 --> 18:30.370]  We, you know, for all I know, Gav, we might be the three of us.
[18:30.470 --> 18:30.850]  I'll say, fuck it.
[18:31.330 --> 18:32.550]  The five of us.
[18:32.990 --> 18:33.690]  We're a group.
[18:33.690 --> 18:39.210]  The five of us might be in a boardroom meeting right now with Mark Cuban going over the finer
[18:39.210 --> 18:40.670]  points of Beef Bracelet.
[18:41.270 --> 18:41.710]  I don't know.
[18:42.030 --> 18:42.410]  It's true.
[18:42.850 --> 18:45.810]  That might be why we have to move a future recording for that meeting.
[18:46.250 --> 18:51.970]  We might be in court right now dealing with a lawsuit from the estate of Don Zimmer.
[18:52.150 --> 18:54.250]  I have no idea what's going on.
[18:54.610 --> 18:55.430]  You know what I mean?
[18:57.810 --> 18:59.170]  I can't believe that happened.
[18:59.190 --> 18:59.510]  I'm sorry.
[18:59.510 --> 19:05.950]  I'm still lost that I got a call from them while we're recording right after I talked
[19:05.950 --> 19:10.730]  about pointing the crew at you, the bits.
[19:10.910 --> 19:13.990]  Do you know who got a call from them right before you did?
[19:15.850 --> 19:17.950]  You dodged a call on this podcast.
[19:18.510 --> 19:20.530]  I'm not going to pick up the phone while I'm on the podcast.
[19:20.650 --> 19:21.130]  I'm a professional.
[19:21.310 --> 19:21.390]  Oh, yeah.
[19:21.790 --> 19:22.230]  Oh, yeah.
[19:22.790 --> 19:23.690]  I didn't know it was him.
[19:23.710 --> 19:24.470]  Because it's content.
[19:24.850 --> 19:26.590]  And I thought we were about content, Gav.
[19:26.590 --> 19:27.810]  I didn't know.
[19:27.810 --> 19:29.910]  I didn't know that it was them calling.
[19:30.110 --> 19:30.850]  It was just a number.
[19:31.050 --> 19:32.070]  I didn't know who it was.
[19:32.550 --> 19:33.590]  I feel like you have to.
[19:33.830 --> 19:35.510]  Yeah, you have to pick up, though, in the content.
[19:35.670 --> 19:37.430]  And you're just being fucking naive.
[19:37.530 --> 19:37.930]  You're pretending.
[19:38.310 --> 19:38.450]  I'm not.
[19:38.510 --> 19:42.350]  Briefly, going into the Zimmers zone, you said last time, Geoff, that there was some
[19:42.350 --> 19:46.390]  discussions about people trying to predict the next manager card that might have value.
[19:46.470 --> 19:48.370]  Has that leaked into other managers yet?
[19:48.390 --> 19:50.170]  Or is it still mainly Zim?
[19:50.630 --> 19:52.650]  It's still Zim, as far as I know.
[19:52.730 --> 19:57.010]  I think for it to leak into other managers, it would require a push by us.
[19:57.010 --> 19:58.250]  And I don't know.
[19:58.390 --> 19:59.650]  I don't know who the next manager would be.
[19:59.810 --> 20:02.590]  Although I will say, I will say, and I'm not advocating.
[20:02.970 --> 20:04.690]  I'm not advocating that we...
[20:04.690 --> 20:07.010]  First off, I don't want to turn this into a manager thing, right?
[20:07.430 --> 20:08.430]  I think it should come naturally.
[20:08.630 --> 20:10.870]  If it's going to leak to other people, it's even better.
[20:11.150 --> 20:11.770]  It's like Inception.
[20:12.130 --> 20:15.390]  It's like we just point the idea and then it just takes its own form.
[20:15.670 --> 20:16.310]  Well, it's exactly.
[20:16.430 --> 20:18.930]  It's like we didn't pick Zimmer, first of all.
[20:19.310 --> 20:20.210]  Zimmer picked us.
[20:22.110 --> 20:24.270]  If you think about it, we were...
[20:24.270 --> 20:25.730]  He picked us seven years after he died.
[20:25.730 --> 20:27.630]  We were looking at...
[20:27.630 --> 20:28.350]  We were going to be...
[20:28.350 --> 20:30.270]  I think we were going to do Bobby Valentine or something.
[20:30.650 --> 20:31.670]  And then Zimmer popped up.
[20:31.750 --> 20:34.950]  And then suddenly we were awash in the glow of Don Zimmer.
[20:35.510 --> 20:39.870]  And it was a huge light bulb moment that was as big as his smiling, sunny cheeks.
[20:40.230 --> 20:43.770]  And we realized that that was that was that was meant to be.
[20:44.050 --> 20:45.350]  So we'll find the next Don Zimmer.
[20:45.670 --> 20:49.750]  I don't think it's necessarily going to be Jim Leland or some other baseball coach.
[20:49.870 --> 20:50.990]  But, you know, maybe it will.
[20:51.190 --> 20:51.590]  Who knows?
[20:51.970 --> 20:53.090]  A million dollars, Geoff.
[20:53.090 --> 20:57.650]  But you have to receive the total amount of chewing tobacco
[20:57.650 --> 21:00.630]  that has been spit out of Don Zimmer's mouth in his life.
[21:01.710 --> 21:02.850]  How do I receive it?
[21:02.970 --> 21:04.530]  It just gets put on your front lawn.
[21:05.050 --> 21:05.830]  Oh, yeah, I'll do that.
[21:06.090 --> 21:07.270]  He's never going to receive that.
[21:07.390 --> 21:07.890]  I would do that.
[21:08.030 --> 21:08.810]  I would do that in a second.
[21:09.290 --> 21:13.510]  You ever drink fucking chewing tobacco like somebody else's spit cup?
[21:13.530 --> 21:13.870]  No.
[21:13.930 --> 21:14.630]  Oh, God, no.
[21:15.030 --> 21:15.910]  I did that once in the army.
[21:16.370 --> 21:19.450]  It was instant vomit.
[21:19.650 --> 21:21.750]  Yeah, I think we've talked about it before, probably on old podcasts.
[21:21.750 --> 21:24.850]  That's also another problem with doing podcasts for like 20 years,
[21:24.950 --> 21:28.330]  is, man, you covered all your shit like in the first two years,
[21:28.390 --> 21:30.890]  and then you've just spent the last 18 saying it over again.
[21:31.290 --> 21:33.910]  Yeah, and then things like a port-a-potty show up,
[21:34.030 --> 21:35.630]  and you just don't answer those calls.
[21:36.030 --> 21:38.450]  You just reject everything you did to it.
[21:38.630 --> 21:40.890]  Yeah, it would have been way funnier if a port-a-potty showed up,
[21:40.930 --> 21:42.930]  and I took a picture of it, and then we put the picture up on Instagram,
[21:43.210 --> 21:45.230]  and then we didn't have all this to talk about.
[21:45.650 --> 21:46.970]  You not doing anything?
[21:46.990 --> 21:47.930]  We just don't want two phone calls.
[21:47.930 --> 21:52.610]  If I had answered that phone the first 712 times they called,
[21:52.710 --> 21:55.390]  we wouldn't have caught it on the fucking podcast.
[21:55.390 --> 21:58.390]  It would be in Eric's yard right now is where it would be.
[21:59.090 --> 22:00.270]  They'd be different content.
[22:00.550 --> 22:01.710]  No, it wouldn't. It wouldn't.
[22:01.790 --> 22:03.070]  And I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why.
[22:03.270 --> 22:07.990]  Because I didn't have the idea to do that at all until you pissed me off last episode.
[22:08.350 --> 22:11.850]  You pissed me off last episode, and that's when I got the idea in that moment.
[22:12.030 --> 22:13.250]  I gave you the idea.
[22:13.630 --> 22:16.850]  You gave me the idea in the episode because you were mad at me
[22:16.850 --> 22:21.150]  because I didn't receive the fucking thing yet, and because I didn't receive it.
[22:21.550 --> 22:25.830]  That gave you the idea to give me the idea to give Eric the port-o-potty,
[22:25.890 --> 22:27.810]  which is brilliant, so you're all welcome.
[22:27.930 --> 22:30.190]  I think the relationship has deteriorated.
[22:30.350 --> 22:33.770]  Check the fucking tapes in the snow.
[22:34.070 --> 22:36.370]  The snow episode, the first snow episode,
[22:36.510 --> 22:37.750]  I said, Gavin, how was your pipes?
[22:37.830 --> 22:39.350]  And Gavin did not want to answer how his pipes were,
[22:39.630 --> 22:41.670]  and I suggested you give him a toilet.
[22:42.170 --> 22:42.990]  That's when this started.
[22:43.250 --> 22:44.050]  What about my pipes?
[22:44.050 --> 22:47.830]  Back in the snow episode, first episode after the snow,
[22:47.930 --> 22:50.090]  where I revealed the port-o-potty to Geoff,
[22:50.490 --> 22:51.850]  Geoff was not thrilled about it.
[22:52.110 --> 22:53.630]  I said, Gavin, how are your pipes?
[22:53.730 --> 22:55.230]  Maybe you need a port-o-potty,
[22:55.450 --> 22:57.850]  to which Geoff was very happy about the suggestion.
[22:58.190 --> 23:01.710]  It is not my fault you then forgot that you had that concept
[23:01.710 --> 23:04.090]  or that you embraced it and then remembered it weeks later.
[23:04.550 --> 23:06.030]  That idea has existed long ago.
[23:06.570 --> 23:08.070]  I don't remember why we're arguing.
[23:11.530 --> 23:15.070]  Yeah, but that wasn't, now I have the idea as vendetta.
[23:15.630 --> 23:16.630]  That was to help Gavin.
[23:16.890 --> 23:20.510]  This is to get even with Eric and Nick for existing.
[23:20.750 --> 23:23.390]  I feel like I've been a bystander to the whole port-o-potty.
[23:23.450 --> 23:24.750]  I've just been enjoying it on the side.
[23:24.910 --> 23:27.810]  That's part of your, that's part of your guilt.
[23:28.230 --> 23:31.510]  I don't really understand why, why would you get even with me?
[23:31.690 --> 23:33.110]  I want to get even with everybody.
[23:33.790 --> 23:36.050]  But you specifically said getting even with me.
[23:36.050 --> 23:36.770]  I don't know.
[23:37.430 --> 23:38.250]  I don't know.
[23:38.310 --> 23:39.310]  Because you're in front of me right now.
[23:39.790 --> 23:40.270]  Yeah, why not?
[23:40.770 --> 23:41.490]  It was you or Nick.
[23:41.870 --> 23:43.270]  I mean, Nick's not a sock guy.
[23:43.610 --> 23:48.030]  The bench, the bench isn't deep for me to be, for me to point my anger at here.
[23:51.090 --> 23:51.870]  That was great.
[23:52.330 --> 23:53.410]  You're gonna have a port-o-potty.
[23:53.470 --> 23:54.330]  It's really cool, dude.
[23:54.370 --> 23:54.850]  It's pink.
[23:55.130 --> 23:55.730]  It's big and pink.
[23:56.030 --> 23:56.390]  It's awesome.
[23:56.790 --> 23:57.590]  I'm excited for you.
[23:57.770 --> 23:59.690]  You got to do at least one episode inside it.
[23:59.690 --> 24:01.570]  I think that's all I need.
[24:01.950 --> 24:04.770]  I think, I think that's a great idea too.
[24:04.770 --> 24:06.450]  And I'll do it.
[24:06.450 --> 24:08.550]  And then you'll do your episode in your yard.
[24:09.790 --> 24:13.710]  And then Eric can produce it from the port-o-potty once.
[24:14.030 --> 24:16.130]  And then Nick can do whatever Nick does.
[24:16.430 --> 24:22.230]  I think it's harder to mess with Andrew because he doesn't have a yard to get stuff dumped.
[24:22.430 --> 24:23.410]  No, yeah.
[24:23.490 --> 24:25.750]  And we're not even sure what his fucking name is.
[24:25.910 --> 24:28.030]  His apartment isn't even attached to the building.
[24:28.310 --> 24:29.810]  No, it would never get to me.
[24:30.050 --> 24:30.890]  That's the funniest part.
[24:30.970 --> 24:33.210]  It would just be in a lobby and I wouldn't know it was there.
[24:33.210 --> 24:35.190]  You'd have to come out wearing a towel.
[24:35.390 --> 24:36.070]  I would.
[24:38.230 --> 24:39.610]  I'm not going anywhere right now.
[24:40.090 --> 24:41.150]  Don't send anything to me.
[24:41.230 --> 24:41.970]  I'm not getting it.
[24:42.090 --> 24:42.890]  Do you have a wheelchair?
[24:43.390 --> 24:45.110]  No, I should get crutches though.
[24:45.270 --> 24:46.450]  I keep thinking about that.
[24:46.770 --> 24:47.530]  Crutches would be good.
[24:48.010 --> 24:49.790]  Wheelchair would be no good because I have several levels.
[24:50.350 --> 24:51.330]  Unless I build ramps.
[24:51.390 --> 24:52.670]  I could do ramps, but then how do I get up?
[24:52.690 --> 24:57.950]  You should get the, you should get the little, like the stair chair like the old lady in Gremlins.
[24:58.250 --> 24:59.530]  Yeah, that could be fun.
[24:59.970 --> 25:00.210]  Yeah.
[25:00.370 --> 25:02.070]  Do they make those that like go up and down?
[25:02.190 --> 25:03.070]  Or is it just straight?
[25:03.070 --> 25:06.070]  No, they go up and then the people just die up there.
[25:06.390 --> 25:08.350]  Well, if there's Gremlins, they die.
[25:09.290 --> 25:10.590]  I want like a loop one.
[25:11.090 --> 25:11.710]  That'd be fun.
[25:12.130 --> 25:12.570]  A loop?
[25:12.950 --> 25:16.030]  Yeah, like a track that kind of like goes up and around and then down.
[25:16.330 --> 25:19.390]  I think it's more efficient to go up to go down the one you just came up.
[25:19.590 --> 25:23.090]  It's supposed to go across the stairs and back down the other side.
[25:23.470 --> 25:26.190]  No, I want to do, I want to go from wall to wall.
[25:26.310 --> 25:27.750]  You're like, oh, fuck, I forgot that.
[25:27.830 --> 25:29.610]  I forgot my glasses on that table.
[25:29.870 --> 25:31.190]  I got to go around again.
[25:32.790 --> 25:37.350]  I wanted to be like an on rails, like when you're on tracks in a video game segment.
[25:37.550 --> 25:38.850]  I want both walls covered.
[25:39.010 --> 25:39.750]  I want to go all over.
[25:39.870 --> 25:44.430]  If we could get a stairlift company to build basically like a
[25:45.350 --> 25:49.630]  railed racecourse around your house going all through each floor, that'd be brilliant.
[25:50.150 --> 25:51.350]  Yeah, you could just stay on.
[25:51.530 --> 25:51.770]  I'm all about it.
[25:52.110 --> 25:53.610]  You wouldn't ever have to get off that chair.
[25:53.710 --> 25:57.350]  If you if you need a mug from the kitchen, just wait until it passes the kitchen door.
[25:57.450 --> 26:00.850]  Reach in, grab it, get some water from the bathroom as it goes by.
[26:01.190 --> 26:02.670]  That's the perfect life for you.
[26:02.710 --> 26:03.650]  Andrew on rails.
[26:03.870 --> 26:04.530]  That's Andrew.
[26:04.770 --> 26:06.990]  That's that's a great that's a great product rails.
[26:07.350 --> 26:08.870]  I would even use bits for that.
[26:09.250 --> 26:09.890]  Life on rails.
[26:10.310 --> 26:12.290]  Oh, that's fancy.
[26:12.410 --> 26:12.950]  I like this.
[26:13.010 --> 26:14.330]  This sounds like a TLC show.
[26:14.670 --> 26:19.130]  What would be your preferred speed for like a full loop of the house?
[26:19.570 --> 26:21.970]  Oh, would you want like a five minute loop?
[26:22.250 --> 26:24.010]  Oh, no, that's way too slow.
[26:24.530 --> 26:25.010]  Five minutes.
[26:25.130 --> 26:25.830]  That's too slow.
[26:26.010 --> 26:27.690]  Have you seen how slow those things move?
[26:28.010 --> 26:28.870]  Yeah, that's too slow.
[26:28.990 --> 26:29.310]  Five minutes.
[26:29.370 --> 26:29.870]  No, I haven't.
[26:29.870 --> 26:31.330]  Well, yeah, I mean, I've seen them.

[27:45.970 --> 27:48.730]  But I've never really noticed the slowness of them.
[27:49.030 --> 27:51.510]  I've never seen them on a cool track either though, so.
[27:51.930 --> 27:52.230]  That's true.
[27:52.790 --> 27:55.710]  Boost the speed up a little bit. It'd be pretty good.
[27:56.610 --> 27:59.010]  Like minute loops. I think you'd be hauling ass.
[27:59.350 --> 28:02.890]  I want to haul ass on this chair.
[28:03.070 --> 28:04.930]  You'd be pulling some G's around the corners.
[28:07.190 --> 28:10.630]  That'd be great. I'm all about this. I support this fully.

[29:26.380 --> 29:30.580]  annoying, hard day at work, when you realize, oh, I didn't even think about dinner,
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.000]  when you open up your fridge, like I do, and you see that HelloFresh package and you think,
[29:35.140 --> 29:38.940]  ah, I'm 30 minutes away from flavor, good flavor, healthy flavor.

[29:59.680 --> 30:04.520]  There are tons of VPN providers out there. You've probably heard of a couple of them,
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.800]  and some of you may have even used a VPN before. But I like to do research on my sponsors,
[30:10.100 --> 30:14.340]  and I only recommend brands to my listeners that I believe in.
[30:14.340 --> 30:20.920]  I can say with the fullest of full confidence that ExpressVPN is the best VPN on the market.
[30:21.500 --> 30:27.840]  Here's why. ExpressVPN doesn't log your data. Lots of really cheap or free VPNs make money
[30:27.840 --> 30:32.760]  by selling your data to ad companies, kinda. ExpressVPN developed a technology called
[30:32.760 --> 30:37.460]  trusted server. I love that word, trusted. I love that other word, server. You put them together,
[30:37.840 --> 30:41.400]  well, that's something you can believe in. It makes it impossible for their servers to log
[30:41.400 --> 30:46.560]  any of your info. Second is speed. I've tried lots of VPNs in the past. Many slow your connection
[30:46.560 --> 30:53.900]  down, or make your device sluggish, like Gavin going through life. I've been using ExpressVPN for
[30:53.900 --> 30:58.760]  a long amount of time, and my internet speeds are blazing fast. Even when I connect to servers
[30:58.760 --> 31:02.680]  that are thousands of miles away, not that I do, and if I did it wouldn't be any of your business
[31:02.680 --> 31:08.180]  anyway, but I could still stream HD quality videos with zero lag, assuming I would do such a thing.
[31:08.420 --> 31:10.780]  Not that I'm doing such a thing. Leave me alone.
[31:11.400 --> 31:13.100]  Back off. I'm not judging you.
[31:13.560 --> 31:18.860]  The last thing that really sets ExpressVPN apart from the other VPNs is how easy it is to use.
[31:19.200 --> 31:24.560]  Unlike other VPNs, you don't have to be a fancy rocket scientist. You don't have to use an input
[31:24.560 --> 31:30.520]  or a programming language, any of that stuff. You just fire up the old app, and you click a button,
[31:30.720 --> 31:36.220]  and you're done. It's so easy even your grandparents could use it. And it's not just me saying this.
[31:36.220 --> 31:43.720]  Wired, The Verge, CNET, and many other tech experts rate ExpressVPN the number one VPN in the world.
[31:44.000 --> 31:49.400]  Just ask your average collectible spoon enthusiast. So protect yourself with the VPN
[31:49.400 --> 31:56.960]  that I use and trust. Use my link expressvpn.com slash face today and get a thimble full, a
[31:56.960 --> 32:03.540]  collectible thimble full extra three months free on a one-year package. That's expressvpn.com slash

[32:11.740 --> 32:15.700]  I forgot as I was like, what was it? What was I going to say? Did we talk about what Don Zimmer
[32:15.700 --> 32:20.340]  wanted to do when he fought Pedro Martinez? No. I think we discussed what we believe. Like,
[32:20.340 --> 32:24.960]  it seemed like he was steamrolling him. I saw a clip of him at like some benefit talking about
[32:24.960 --> 32:29.320]  his whole fight strategy, his whole game plan. We kind of nailed it going off of memory.
[32:29.320 --> 32:35.100]  He wanted to bull rush Pedro Martinez and knock him over with his head and then punch him. That
[32:35.100 --> 32:41.160]  was his game plan. I've never heard anyone have that attack plan. He's like, I was going to run
[32:41.160 --> 32:45.160]  as fast as I could, which wasn't fast. And I was going to put my head in his chest and I was going
[32:45.160 --> 32:50.160]  to punch him in the face. I think that would take me down. You think? Oh, Don Zimmer could take you
[32:50.160 --> 32:55.600]  down for sure. Absolutely. You know who another, I know we're not going to get caught up on managers,
[32:55.600 --> 33:00.660]  but the beauty of Don Zimmer is that he's such a fucking character.
[33:00.900 --> 33:03.840]  And he also looks like if Popeye got stung by a wasp.
[33:06.580 --> 33:09.800]  There is. And I think we may have even mentioned it when he died. But
[33:09.800 --> 33:14.500]  Tommy Lasorda was also another great, great, great baseball manager who was a lunatic
[33:14.500 --> 33:19.980]  and who had who was a crazy character. I feel like there needs to be some sort of
[33:19.980 --> 33:28.320]  entity that that that exists to highlight and showcase the antics of old, dead baseball
[33:28.320 --> 33:32.940]  managers. It's like a lost art. Yeah, I just I just I feel like there's so many of those,
[33:33.020 --> 33:36.820]  like so many of those great characters that you don't see anymore. You know, nobody's nobody's
[33:36.820 --> 33:42.400]  putting like shoe polish mustaches on and going and trying to secretly coach anymore. Not in 2021.
[33:43.900 --> 33:48.460]  No, that era of professional sports seems to be behind us. What put an end to that?
[33:50.240 --> 33:54.820]  What is this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, is this a fall video? Please know it's a fall video.
[33:55.360 --> 34:00.060]  Let me load this up. Love it by a bat after being hit by bat. Was it like thrown?
[34:00.920 --> 34:06.560]  Oh, please tell me it's thrown. Oh, what a hit. Oh, the bat shattered. Is he playing?
[34:08.860 --> 34:13.340]  No, I think he's coached. He was coached. Did they show an angle of what happened? Yeah,
[34:13.340 --> 34:31.760]  they need to be all started. Oh, fuck. It looks like it looks like a weeble wobble falling.
[34:36.580 --> 34:41.140]  He went down. You know, look at the end of the Matrix when he was on the minigun and he's just
[34:41.140 --> 34:48.540]  mowing down agents in the water. He went down like he got shot.
[34:53.550 --> 34:55.810]  You're getting taken down by a fucking bat.
[34:58.050 --> 35:01.510]  It didn't even look like he was trying to catch it like he was like waving it off.
[35:01.730 --> 35:11.170]  By the way, in the process of, you know, we talked about the falls. We mentioned that Kelsey
[35:11.170 --> 35:14.810]  Grammer fall, which people talked about, I guess, a couple of times on the on this podcast.
[35:15.950 --> 35:20.430]  But people started sending in their favorite falls. Did you guys see? I'd never seen it before.
[35:20.730 --> 35:26.730]  But did you guys see the Travis Scott one falling? No, no. Travis Scott falling in autotune.
[35:26.930 --> 35:29.570]  Hold on a second. You got to listen to it, though, because that's an autotune.
[35:30.530 --> 35:36.350]  Hold on a second. Well, I'll make sure this is it. How many Travis Scott autotunes could there be
[35:36.350 --> 35:40.470]  of him? There's two different versions. I'm trying to find that. OK, I got this is that
[35:41.170 --> 35:46.670]  it is like you went down like a bowling pin, like there was no you had no strength in his legs.
[35:47.190 --> 35:52.130]  Oh, you found it. Yeah. We should start a face YouTube playlist where people can.
[35:52.450 --> 35:55.950]  We really should. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. Watch that one with sound.
[35:56.170 --> 36:02.890]  OK, I don't know. And I didn't do it. The autotune sound doesn't do it.
[36:02.990 --> 36:06.050]  Oh, wait, this is the I'm going to say the wrong one. This is this one.
[36:06.770 --> 36:13.010]  I have to. This is a better one. This is a better. OK, there's got a good one.
[36:13.270 --> 36:18.550]  There was great. Yeah. Oh, man. What's the third one? This is your third.
[36:19.030 --> 36:24.890]  I think. Yeah. OK. You said that's the worst one. Yeah. I did time to figure out which one was the
[36:24.890 --> 36:29.430]  best. And you still said the worst one. Here's why. I didn't realize there were two versions
[36:29.430 --> 36:34.070]  of that. I just knew that it was from that angle. OK. Is that not actually what the sound that came
[36:34.070 --> 36:38.030]  out? I think it is. How's this two versions of it, then? I don't know. Do they sound different?
[36:38.290 --> 36:42.210]  They do. The second one is my favorite. The second one is the best one.
[36:48.310 --> 36:52.010]  Anyway, I don't know who said that to us on Twitter, but I saw it the other day and I thought
[36:52.010 --> 36:58.230]  that was that's definitely up there for me. That's a great fall. Tommy Lasorda. I'm just
[36:58.230 --> 37:01.830]  going to I just want to watch Tommy Lasorda clips the rest of the day of him falling over. I could
[37:01.830 --> 37:06.010]  watch that on loop. Is there a gif? There has to be a gif of that. That would bring me joy.
[37:06.690 --> 37:12.130]  I've never seen someone fall so easily. So we need a face YouTube playlist. That's a great idea.
[37:12.430 --> 37:17.570]  That is a fantastic idea. We just keep it up to date every few weeks. Does it have to be things
[37:17.570 --> 37:22.590]  we talk about on the shark? We just throw in find a weird thing. I don't know. I don't care
[37:22.590 --> 37:27.470]  one way or the other. OK. Gavin's still thinking about it, though. No, I appreciate the thought.
[37:28.490 --> 37:32.390]  You just let us know when you get there, OK? Yeah. You think you want to go get another snack?
[37:32.510 --> 37:36.950]  I think it's been decided within the group. Has it? Oh, did I tell you? Did you guys see that
[37:36.950 --> 37:43.870]  thing I said last night about 20 boxes of 89 Fleer to try to get more face cards? Oh, yeah. 20 sealed
[37:43.870 --> 37:48.990]  boxes. Yeah. They're going to be black box. Yeah, I'm sure they are. But how much does that cost?
[37:48.990 --> 37:56.770]  Uh, I bought it on Goodwill, so I think I think I paid 100 bucks. Yeah, whatever it is,
[37:57.310 --> 38:01.930]  five bucks, five bucks a box or something. Hmm. Have you opened any of them? No,
[38:01.970 --> 38:05.830]  I haven't received them yet. I just bought them yesterday when I. Oh, OK. It'll be a while.
[38:06.110 --> 38:12.770]  The other rare one in that is the Randy Johnson Marlboro car. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's even
[38:12.770 --> 38:17.570]  rarer than the Billy Ripken, I think, though. I believe so. I think it's a really limited run
[38:17.570 --> 38:23.870]  because I know that when the one like you bought us those boxes and I got a Randy Johnson,
[38:23.870 --> 38:29.630]  but it was it was it had already been edited. What's the last do they still make error cards
[38:29.630 --> 38:33.230]  like that anymore? I'm trying to think like what was the most recent great error card?
[38:33.770 --> 38:40.270]  Um, I don't know if there's a recent great one, but there's one in this year's 21 hoops where.
[38:40.270 --> 38:48.030]  Um. I don't know, like some player auto Porter or somebody has a Jeremy Lamb on the back instead
[38:48.030 --> 38:51.590]  of them, I believe, but it's like just that kind of like boring. Yeah. Different front from the
[38:51.590 --> 38:56.370]  back. Yeah, I've gotten like a bonus card with the wrong team logo on it, but it's yeah, as far
[38:56.370 --> 39:00.090]  as like a great I don't feel like they make the same. Is it because they're not making them in
[39:00.090 --> 39:06.850]  the same volume, I wonder, or like what? I guess. I don't know. Or maybe the just the quality control
[39:06.850 --> 39:13.310]  is a lot higher. That could be it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So now that we've cut that conversation,
[39:13.570 --> 39:18.150]  what where do we leave before we were cut off? You could go into a new subject just that. Oh,
[39:18.150 --> 39:23.730]  yeah. OK, I'm I'm on it like the way Gavin your hummus thing in the beginning or whatever you
[39:23.730 --> 39:27.990]  had. I've been like that ever since that phone call. That's just why I like I can't. It's going
[39:27.990 --> 39:32.210]  to take me a while to wrap my head around that Texas called. We organized this Porter body thing.
[39:32.230 --> 39:35.950]  It's finally going to happen. How do you have an American number, by the way? Oh,
[39:35.950 --> 39:41.070]  for the poster. Do we want to talk about that back to the show? I mean, just in general,
[39:41.130 --> 39:46.570]  when I text you, I'm not texting a Canadian number. We discussed this. Remember that episode
[39:46.570 --> 39:52.430]  he was calling me from his L.A. number or whatever? Yeah, I forgot I made that because I
[39:52.430 --> 39:56.770]  did a prank where I told somebody that we're going to be a Judge Judy. And so I had a California
[39:56.770 --> 40:01.350]  number. But how? Wait. So when I if I'm texting Canada every time I text you, is that charging me
[40:01.350 --> 40:06.110]  for every text? No, it shouldn't. No, it shouldn't be. I mean, on most plans, it's free.
[40:06.190 --> 40:11.910]  I have free texting international. Part of my plan. I can't tell you what's part of your plan.
[40:13.690 --> 40:18.190]  Would it make a difference if you had to pay to talk to Andrew? Would you not?
[40:18.830 --> 40:23.530]  I don't know. We had that run where we were texting nonstop. I bet that cost me like 80 bucks.
[40:25.050 --> 40:29.070]  We might have another run. I feel like we go on texting runs when we don't have an episode that
[40:29.070 --> 40:33.030]  week. That seems to be the pattern that I've noticed when you don't have a show.
[40:33.170 --> 40:38.450]  What have you guys been texting about most recently? Oh, not like interesting show stuff,
[40:38.510 --> 40:43.850]  I'd say. A lot about Hitman, the game. Yeah, a lot about Hitman. I'd say, yeah, not like fun.
[40:43.950 --> 40:49.210]  I opened my text to Andrew the other day and I found something that I was going to text,
[40:49.350 --> 40:55.870]  but I forgot to send. And then I just erased it. What was it? I was annoyed about, you know how
[40:55.870 --> 41:02.170]  some games they use the name of the game in the game? Like if you're playing Uno, it's like you
[41:02.170 --> 41:07.610]  shout Uno. Or like if you're playing snooker, you could snooker somebody. It's like when you block
[41:07.610 --> 41:12.870]  them from hitting their other balls. I was playing Scrabble. You know what it's called when you use
[41:12.870 --> 41:19.470]  every tile in Scrabble? No. Is it called a Scrabble? It's called Bingo. No. Is it really?
[41:19.770 --> 41:23.270]  Yeah, it just annoyed me. I was like, you got perfect. It's like a term for using all the
[41:23.270 --> 41:30.170]  freaking tiles and they didn't call it a Scrabble? Insanity to me. Anyway, I typed that out. I read
[41:30.170 --> 41:34.530]  it back. I thought there's no point in saying this to someone. No, I'm outraged by this.
[41:34.870 --> 41:39.030]  What is a Scrabble then? I couldn't believe it. Nothing. Scrabble isn't anything. It's just the
[41:39.030 --> 41:46.110]  game. When you Google what is a Scrabble, the top people also ask is what is Scrabble all about?
[41:47.110 --> 41:51.570]  I think we kind of know what Scrabble is at this point. What's the deal with Scrabble?
[41:53.410 --> 41:59.730]  God damn. Yeah, I was irrationally annoyed. It's a perfect term for that. You Scrabble someone.
[42:00.810 --> 42:06.910]  Nope. Bingo. It's 50 points though. What the fuck? Why? Is it an additional 50 points for
[42:06.910 --> 42:11.250]  using all seven letters? Additional 50 bonus points for a Bingo in Scrabble. In addition to
[42:11.250 --> 42:15.590]  whatever. That's a hell of a... What was the score? Do you remember? No. Did you get a Bingo?
[42:16.050 --> 42:19.490]  I did get a Bingo. I can't remember what it was. You don't remember what it was. Did you win that
[42:19.490 --> 42:24.770]  game? Yeah. Were you playing against Meg? Yeah. Boy, you guys have a lot of fun. That's cool. We
[42:24.770 --> 42:31.230]  didn't have power for four days. That wasn't a lot of... We couldn't play snooker. Listen, you're
[42:31.230 --> 42:35.710]  being very defensive from me saying you guys have fun. Sounds like you're having a blast over there.
[42:36.030 --> 42:41.470]  Scrabble is fun. You got a Bingo. With someone you like... How is the best? Bingoing someone in
[42:41.470 --> 42:46.090]  Scrabble that you like. It's an amazing feeling. When was the last time you did that? I don't know
[42:46.090 --> 42:52.450]  I've ever Bingoed anybody. I gotta be honest with you. I don't know that I've ever Bingoed. I do
[42:52.900 --> 42:58.190]  think that you're right. It sounds... I think that that should be a shirt. What did you say? Bingoing
[42:58.190 --> 43:06.290]  somebody in Scrabble feels really good. It's one of the weirder sentences, I'll be honest.
[43:09.210 --> 43:13.070]  What? Does the game immediately end when you Bingo? What would be the disadvantage?
[43:13.070 --> 43:18.310]  Why would it be a point value? It's the golden snitch. Yeah, I thought it was the golden snitch.
[43:18.550 --> 43:22.930]  Because I'm on a Scrabble subreddit and the person's like, should I play the Bingo here?
[43:22.990 --> 43:26.290]  And they're all having like strategy talk of like, I don't know if you should play it yet.
[43:26.670 --> 43:30.850]  I don't like, why wouldn't you? Well, you could potentially get a better score with two different
[43:30.850 --> 43:36.810]  words. Wait a minute. Andrew, do you not play Scrabble? I mean, I've played Scrabble. I wouldn't
[43:36.810 --> 43:40.970]  say I'm a Scrabble player. So, you know, there's like a triple word score. Maybe the Bingo would
[43:40.970 --> 43:45.070]  take you away from those bonuses and it wouldn't be worth playing. Or if you hold on to it for a
[43:45.070 --> 43:48.430]  little while and just try to throw some easy vowels out that you know you'll replace, you can
[43:48.430 --> 43:52.870]  wait till the board moves in a direction where you can pop the Bingo down and get a bigger fucking
[43:52.870 --> 43:56.690]  payday, maybe. I think they need to address the value of the Bingo then, because the Bingo should
[43:56.690 --> 44:01.130]  be like a huge play. You should just have a massive... 50 points is pretty big. Yeah, well,
[44:01.190 --> 44:05.090]  then you should always play the Bingo. Like, that's just the weird thing. Like, I don't want
[44:05.090 --> 44:10.210]  to play a small word with a three time score. I just want the Bingo. If the Bingo was only
[44:10.210 --> 44:15.350]  available over... like, if a six letter word could go over a triple word score away from the Bingo,
[44:15.430 --> 44:20.290]  you probably want to do that. Yeah, it should be a rule where if you have a Bingo, you have to play
[44:20.290 --> 44:27.390]  it. How do you know if you... Scrabble's not about, like, you automatically generate it. I get it. I'm
[44:27.390 --> 44:32.890]  saying, though, if you know, there should be no... How do they know you know? How does anyone check
[44:32.890 --> 44:37.430]  that? They can't see you. Have you ever played Scrabble? I have played Scrabble. Nobody should
[44:37.430 --> 44:42.630]  be lying in the game of Scrabble. It's a gentleman's game. You know what, though? They
[44:42.630 --> 44:47.910]  shouldn't be allowed to use Bingo. As a word? Yeah, it's taken. You yell Bingo when you get a
[44:47.910 --> 44:53.570]  Bingo. That's too confusing. Maybe we just don't know what Bingo means. Maybe Bingo actually means
[44:54.770 --> 45:01.830]  completion. What does Bingo mean? Like, using up one's inventory could mean Bingo. Hold on,
[45:01.850 --> 45:06.390]  I'm looking it up. A game in which players mark off numbers on cards. Used to express
[45:06.390 --> 45:11.150]  satisfaction or surprise at a sudden positive event or outcome. So, I guess, technically...
[45:11.150 --> 45:14.770]  I want to know if there's a Scrabble in Bingo. Yeah, right? Like, in Bingo,
[45:15.410 --> 45:20.430]  you should be able to Scrabble. Yeah, you could Scrabble other people. Yeah.
[45:24.900 --> 45:31.600]  Like, if you get a Bingo... In Bingo, if you get a Bingo without using the free space,
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.600]  that should be a Scrabble. Could I talk about... I don't think we'll ever talk about Bingo again.
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.400]  Can I talk about the worst prank I've probably ever done to anybody? Didn't deserve it at all.
[45:41.560 --> 45:47.160]  It's Bingo-related? It is Bingo-related. I think you just played it on the audience by saying,
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.500]  the last time we'll ever talk about Bingo again, because that pretty much ensures that
[45:50.500 --> 45:56.160]  there's going to be a Bingo podcast at some point in the future. We could make face Bingo.
[45:56.680 --> 46:00.960]  I can't see us. We could. Andrew blowing out an ankle has to be at least two spaces, though.
[46:01.360 --> 46:05.720]  Yeah. And if you get a Bingo with Andrew blowing out his ankle, that's a Scrabble.
[46:05.720 --> 46:10.600]  We'll make a Bingo card now, and it will be played against episode 100,
[46:10.920 --> 46:13.920]  but it'll be so far out that we won't remember what we put on the Bingo card,
[46:14.060 --> 46:17.400]  and we'll see if anyone gets a Bingo. And then we'll be saddened by how little
[46:17.400 --> 46:23.080]  the jokes have changed. We'll be like, oh, this shit all still applies exactly.
[46:23.940 --> 46:29.820]  Fucked up the intro? Bingo. Oh, God. What were you saying, Andrew?
[46:29.820 --> 46:36.440]  Well, yeah, Bingo. So I used to play Bingo with my family. It would get very heated. We got a
[46:36.440 --> 46:40.240]  whole wheel, got a Bingo wheel. And when I say it was my mom, my grandma and I,
[46:40.940 --> 46:45.980]  and I was probably, I don't know, 15. Does Canada play weird American ruled Bingo
[46:45.980 --> 46:51.160]  where there's like letters as well? No, it's just, well, yeah, yeah. It's like B4
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.680]  or whatever. I'm trying to remember. I don't remember if the balls had that or not. We went
[46:55.680 --> 47:00.340]  through a run of Bingo. We played it a lot and I was super competitive that I'd get really mad if
[47:00.340 --> 47:04.660]  I didn't win, even though it's a random game. This is like, I'm going to win this game. And
[47:04.660 --> 47:10.940]  we're playing and I lost the first one to my mom and she was very happy. And the second game we
[47:10.940 --> 47:14.280]  played, I was like, I'm going to get you back. She won a second game in a row. She started
[47:14.280 --> 47:19.460]  celebrating more. And then she won a third game in a row and it was a full on celebration.
[47:19.700 --> 47:23.360]  And internally, I was mad. She's like, I'm the Bingo queen. I'm the Bingo queen. I'm like, yeah,
[47:23.360 --> 47:29.820]  you're the Bingo queen. That's so great. So I waited until everyone went to bed and I went
[47:29.820 --> 47:34.120]  to her purse and I thought, well, if you're the Bingo queen, you should be able to play Bingo
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.660]  whenever you want to, because you're the Bingo queen. You should be able to defend your crown
[47:38.660 --> 47:45.440]  at any moment. So I emptied her entire purse out and I put all of the Bingo stuff in the purse.
[47:45.500 --> 47:50.260]  I put the cards in. I put all the chips we would use to lay the cards. I even put the fucking
[47:50.260 --> 47:54.020]  wheel in. You know, when like you're trying to fit this, the last thing in a suitcase,
[47:54.020 --> 47:59.000]  you have to like sit in it and it kind of becomes spring loaded. I barely got the wheel in,
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.020]  but the cards were everywhere. So I do this. I'm like, great. I'm going to wake up tomorrow.
[48:03.280 --> 48:07.860]  I'm going to say, hey, you're the Bingo queen. And we'll laugh about the purse. Next day comes,
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.540]  I wake up. Great morning. Just a great day. Brush my teeth, enjoying life, reading my emails.
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.260]  Then I remember I did this. I totally forgot. So I run out my room. She's nowhere on the upper
[48:18.260 --> 48:23.340]  level. Run downstairs. She's not. She's not in the kitchen or the dining room. So I checked the
[48:23.340 --> 48:29.480]  one last spot that confirmed she's still here. Car is not in the garage. She is left. She did
[48:29.480 --> 48:34.900]  not notice that I had taken everything out of her purse. She would keep her keys in a drawer so
[48:34.900 --> 48:38.420]  she'd have no reason to check the purse for the keys. So she would have got the keys, grabbed
[48:38.420 --> 48:44.660]  her purse, left. She doesn't have her license, any way to pay for anything. I took everything
[48:44.660 --> 48:50.380]  out of the purse. All she has is this Bingo stuff. She apparently went to the grocery store
[48:50.380 --> 48:56.320]  to buy the week's worth of groceries that day. And I'm just sitting on the stairs. Just I know I'm
[48:56.320 --> 49:03.320]  going to get yelled at. She went to she filled a cart of items, went went to the front. The guy
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.260]  asked, could you could you? Yeah, like you got to pay this. She opened it. The fucking wheel
[49:08.260 --> 49:14.100]  shot up. Cards fly everywhere. Chips fly everywhere. She is so embarrassed. She's the
[49:14.100 --> 49:19.560]  most lovely person, doesn't deserve any of this. Just chips flying left and right. The guy's like,
[49:19.660 --> 49:24.700]  what's going on? She just leaves the cart and walks. She just walks away, leaving cards on
[49:24.700 --> 49:29.540]  the floor. She just leaves the store. Couldn't shop there for a while. As soon as I heard the
[49:29.540 --> 49:36.040]  garage door open, I was like, oh, God. And I got yelled at real good. Meanest prank I think I've
[49:36.040 --> 49:39.900]  done to anyone who didn't deserve. Oh, did she? Did she see the humor in it or was she just?
[49:39.900 --> 49:45.460]  Oh, no, no. She was mad. She was real. It's probably the most in trouble I've ever been.
[49:45.960 --> 49:49.340]  And it was immediate. As soon as she opened the door, I was already I was like, I'm sorry. I'm
[49:49.340 --> 49:53.220]  sorry. I didn't want to do that. That's not what I wanted to do. I forgot. I'm so sorry.
[49:53.360 --> 49:59.580]  No, that was not part of the plan. She was outraged. But what became the genius of this prank
[49:59.580 --> 50:05.520]  is that we would use these little plastic chips and they stayed in her purse for months.
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.820]  So I don't think I've played bingo with chips or a wheel. Like what bits of bingo are you on about?
[50:11.060 --> 50:14.680]  Well, you know, like instead of pressing the card with the fucking stamp, we had little
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.220]  plastic chips that are like reusable. Yeah. Reusable plastic chips for the card. So we'll
[50:20.220 --> 50:24.180]  scatter them. The bingo wheel, like you spin a wheel and the ball comes out of the wheel.
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.520]  And that's how you call the balls. You're not aware of the bingo wheel. I mean, I wouldn't
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.560]  I've seen like the little like cylindrical cage thing. Yeah, but it's a wheel. It's like a crank
[50:32.560 --> 50:35.780]  wheel. It was a small it was like it was a wheel. It was big, but it wasn't huge.
[50:36.160 --> 50:40.560]  He's thinking it's it's it's like our thing. It's what it's what we do for real. It's just a smaller.
[50:41.360 --> 50:46.600]  Do you think that like after she walked out the door, the one like bagger employee
[50:47.040 --> 50:50.960]  looked to the checker and was like, what the fuck was that? And the checkout guy was like,
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.540]  I don't know what that lady's kid comes in here all the time and is constantly shoplifting.
[50:55.540 --> 51:02.900]  So I'm not surprised. I've never shoplifted, but. Oh, you should probably start your shopping
[51:02.900 --> 51:08.400]  challenge soon, Andrew. The shopping only from the ends. I should. Yeah. Yeah. Once I'm able to
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.100]  leave my place, I will. Yeah. Yeah. I'll do that. But what would happen is because I left these
[51:13.100 --> 51:18.800]  chips everywhere throughout her purse, like three months later, she was in another grocery store
[51:18.800 --> 51:24.280]  doing self checkout, tired, long day after work, just trying to pay for the stuff. And she wasn't
[51:24.280 --> 51:29.660]  paying attention. She put like three chips in the machine and the machine malfunctioned and locked
[51:29.660 --> 51:35.460]  up and was like, emergency, we need help. So she had to go to customer like the customer service
[51:35.460 --> 51:40.620]  area. Someone had the manager came over with a key and opened it and had to like give her the
[51:40.620 --> 51:44.840]  chips back. And she was like the manager gave off like you're trying to steal from us vibe with
[51:44.840 --> 51:50.100]  these comments. She would never do that. It just made her so upset. But like every few it would be
[51:50.100 --> 51:53.660]  like, oh, she accidentally puts them in a tip jar at Starbucks. Like it would just, it was an
[51:53.660 --> 52:01.560]  ongoing, it followed her for like a year, these chips. It's probably the most ongoing prank I've
[52:01.560 --> 52:06.280]  ever done. And it didn't at all deserve to happen to that person. Do you ever do the big shop for
[52:06.280 --> 52:11.340]  your family? Do you ever go and do that? I've no, I've never done the big family shop. Interesting.
[52:11.820 --> 52:16.140]  Have you? Well, yeah, but I just hope that they, uh, I mean, I worked in a supermarket,
[52:16.180 --> 52:20.000]  so it was easy for me. I just want, I want you to be in the middle of the shopping from the
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.840]  end's challenge when you get asked for the first time to provide for the family, just so they're
[52:25.840 --> 52:33.420]  confused. What do I gain from this? It's like, he's like trying to explain it. No, it's funny.
[52:33.480 --> 52:36.920]  It was a funny thing I agreed to. We gained nothing from this. There's no game. You can,
[52:36.960 --> 52:42.880]  you can use one of those litter picking sticks. Like if you can reach it from the end, even if
[52:42.880 --> 52:46.660]  it is down the aisle, I think you have that available to you as well. I don't know because
[52:46.660 --> 52:50.740]  he'll, you got to be careful with Andrew, man, because he'll find a way to take advantage of
[52:50.740 --> 52:56.340]  that. And he'll have a stick that telescopes out the entire length of the fucking aisle.
[52:56.480 --> 52:59.540]  And then it'll be like, oh, but it was too heavy. So we put a wheel on the bottom of it. And then
[52:59.540 --> 53:04.380]  it's got the next thing, you know, it's like, he's got access to anything in the store. He's
[53:04.380 --> 53:09.740]  eventually just got a shopping cart with like a two foot handle. It's like a fishing line.
[53:09.780 --> 53:14.580]  Like I'm cranking it out. I don't know. I feel like it should be somewhat skill-based. Okay.
[53:16.080 --> 53:20.720]  So feel free to get inventive. Yeah. Okay. I'll think about it. I'll get a clarification
[53:20.720 --> 53:24.860]  on the rules before I do this. Yeah. If I need to make a judgment, just let me know
[53:24.860 --> 53:29.440]  and give me a nice summary. I will. Yeah, I will. I'll make sure you give a good ruling
[53:29.440 --> 53:36.740]  and it won't go on for days. All right. I think we're good. That was a good episode.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.520]  Yeah. It feels okay. That's like a strange one. I think the highs were really high. And then just
[53:42.520 --> 53:46.340]  the Texas call was like a fucking curveball. That was brilliant. That was probably one of my
[53:46.340 --> 53:50.480]  favorite moments. It's a crazy one. Especially when Geoff was just screaming numbers and Andrew
[53:50.480 --> 53:55.180]  was genuinely getting all caught up in this. Yeah. I had to knock my headphones off, Geoff,
[53:55.220 --> 54:00.440]  because you were doing that and he was getting irritated, repeating it. What an unac... Much
[54:00.440 --> 54:05.920]  like Tommy Lasorda did not see that coming. The best part about that too is I did not, not only
[54:05.920 --> 54:10.360]  did I not need that fucking tracking number, I didn't use it. You wrote that down for nothing.
[54:11.100 --> 54:16.860]  He knew exactly who I was when I fucking called. He was like, oh you, where the fuck have you been?
[54:17.120 --> 54:19.420]  I was like, I don't know, hanging out without a tracking number.
[54:22.980 --> 54:27.600]  I guess we'll be back and you'll have a port-a-potty next time because we sort of... I guess.
[54:27.780 --> 54:31.840]  I mean, it'll be, it's a good episode in that like, it's one of those weird ones where we
[54:31.840 --> 54:35.500]  set a bunch of shit out into the world and then it hasn't come back to us yet,
[54:35.540 --> 54:40.280]  so we have no idea what to respond to. I really can't believe you told him to wait a week.
[54:40.360 --> 54:43.700]  When you are perfectly capable of receiving it next week.
[54:43.920 --> 54:45.980]  How do you know I am? Maybe I am out of town.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.100]  Because you said you're not out of town.
[54:47.500 --> 54:48.360]  Did I? You told us.
[54:48.620 --> 54:49.300]  When did I say that?
[54:49.580 --> 54:50.360]  In this podcast.
[54:50.860 --> 54:51.500]  I was probably kidding.
