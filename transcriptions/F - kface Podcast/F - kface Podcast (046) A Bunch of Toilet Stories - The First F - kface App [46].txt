[00:47.940 --> 00:50.460]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[01:02.570 --> 01:04.990]  Hang on one sec. I'll be 20 seconds.
[01:04.990 --> 01:11.690]  One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi. Four Mississippi. Five Mississippi. Six Mississippi.
[01:13.310 --> 01:20.450]  19 Mississippi. 20 Mississippi. 21 Mississippi. 22 Mississippi. 23 Mississippi. 24 Mississippi.
[01:20.450 --> 01:26.270]  Why'd you go beyond 20? I was back at 20. You were back at 20! I was back! When? At 20!
[01:26.450 --> 01:28.810]  I sat down at 20! You didn't say anything! Well, I thought you'd stop counting!
[01:29.150 --> 01:32.330]  Well, how am I supposed to know you're back? When they start a race, they don't go
[01:32.330 --> 01:35.650]  3, 2, 1, 0, minus 1, minus 2. People just go!
[01:35.870 --> 01:40.350]  Typically, when they start a race, the people in the race are in front of each other and they can see each other.
[01:40.570 --> 01:45.750]  Yeah, but when they don't do races over the internet, if you could see me in real life, you'd know that I was there waiting to race.
[01:45.870 --> 01:52.450]  If I could see you in real life, I would be dis-a-fucking-pointed, because I FaceTimed with you earlier today and you had a ponytail.
[01:52.910 --> 01:55.350]  What, am I gonna just have hair in front of my eyes?
[01:55.650 --> 01:58.950]  Yes. Or cut your dirty, stringy hair, Gavin!
[01:59.290 --> 02:00.770]  It's very clean, actually.
[02:01.350 --> 02:03.330]  That's fair. Ponytail.
[02:03.550 --> 02:04.290]  We went places.
[02:04.650 --> 02:08.070]  I wash my hair every day and I got told that you're not supposed to do that.
[02:08.350 --> 02:09.010]  With human shampoo?
[02:09.310 --> 02:13.990]  I think it depends on your hair, actually. Some people are supposed to. Most people not.
[02:14.330 --> 02:17.810]  I've always just done everything every day. Seems like the easiest schedule.
[02:18.110 --> 02:24.210]  Same here, buddy. Start at the top, work your way down, first thing in the morning, done. Rinse, repeat, every day until you die.
[02:24.590 --> 02:26.050]  Which episode is this?
[02:26.050 --> 02:33.830]  This is episode 46 of F*** Face, a podcast about... you two idiots doing dumb stuff. And I watch.
[02:34.010 --> 02:36.510]  Eric said, uh, washing your hair every day is too much.
[02:36.870 --> 02:37.590]  Oh, so you're one of them.
[02:37.830 --> 02:43.510]  It's not, it's not. It depends on who you are. If you're a greasy, greasy-headed person like me, you gotta wash it every day.
[02:43.790 --> 02:47.810]  How often should you wash? Is it just literally, like, how often do you wash your hair?
[02:48.990 --> 02:52.010]  Uh, typically every other day or every third day. I rinse it.
[02:52.010 --> 02:54.350]  Okay, every two or three days. Okay, wash, don't always use...
[02:54.350 --> 02:54.930]  Every third day?
[02:55.390 --> 02:55.550]  Yeah.
[02:55.630 --> 02:56.670]  That seems like a lot, three days.
[02:56.990 --> 03:00.490]  I'm not, I'm not, like, a super greasy guy, you know? I'm not like Geoff.
[03:00.650 --> 03:00.770]  That's fair.
[03:01.090 --> 03:09.770]  I will say, uh, my girlfriend doesn't wash her hair every day, but I think that's common, uh, with women with lots of hair, because it's, like, uh, like a two-hour process.
[03:10.150 --> 03:11.490]  Yeah. It's like a whole f***ing thing.
[03:11.910 --> 03:12.090]  Yeah.
[03:12.310 --> 03:18.550]  Just to clarify, when we say wash, we mean use product, not, like, you're not showering for three days. This is...
[03:18.550 --> 03:21.650]  I'll be honest, if I'm ever in the shower, I'm never gonna not do my hair.
[03:21.650 --> 03:27.390]  Yeah, yeah. I've never rinsed off without soap. You know what I mean? Like, like, when you say, like, oh, I'm gonna go rinse off.
[03:27.530 --> 03:35.070]  I guess maybe if you, like, if you, like, leave the ocean, and then you go through the sand, and then you wanna rinse off on that little thing to get the sand off before you get in your car.
[03:35.170 --> 03:35.390]  Ah.
[03:35.470 --> 03:41.950]  But in terms of, like, hopping into a shower to rinse off, I've never been in a shower and not taken a full shower in my life.
[03:42.310 --> 03:46.670]  I don't know how you take a half shower in your actual shower. Like, what would the context even be for that?
[03:46.690 --> 03:50.190]  I guess you just run the water through your hair, is what Eric's saying.
[03:50.510 --> 03:57.230]  Okay. Is that a half shower? I still feel like that's a full shower. I don't know. I feel like there are terms, there are classifications for this that are confusing.
[03:57.650 --> 04:04.710]  While we're early in this episode, are we gonna mention what you told me about in the week, or is that too much information for this podcast?
[04:05.250 --> 04:09.310]  Oh, I don't know. I didn't plan on bringing that up. It's kind of an uneventful thing.
[04:10.430 --> 04:13.690]  Would you call it eventful? I don't think it would be eventful. I don't think it's eventful.
[04:13.690 --> 04:14.950]  I think it's very eventful.
[04:15.190 --> 04:16.490]  Really? I don't think it's eventful.
[04:16.770 --> 04:17.850]  Are we talking about the same thing?
[04:17.850 --> 04:22.270]  I don't know what else we would be talking about. Are we talking about the same thing?
[04:22.530 --> 04:27.950]  How about Andrew doesn't think it's eventful, Gavin does. Why don't you let me decide? I'll be the tiebreaker.
[04:28.230 --> 04:32.930]  Should we say what the thing is on three to make sure we're both talking about the same thing?
[04:33.230 --> 04:37.950]  No, I feel like there's no way we're not talking about the same thing. We can if you want to.
[04:38.410 --> 04:43.810]  Who wants to do the countdown? Stop at the count. Don't just keep counting.
[04:44.570 --> 04:48.610]  Stop it after one. We'll say it and then you can stop counting.
[04:48.670 --> 04:50.410]  I don't think this is a fun story, Gavin.
[04:50.470 --> 04:54.390]  Okay. Three, two, one.
[04:54.750 --> 04:55.610]  I was shitting blood.
[04:55.830 --> 04:56.650]  Negative one.
[04:59.450 --> 05:00.890]  Yeah, I don't think that's a fun story.
[05:02.250 --> 05:05.870]  Well, here's the reason why. Okay, so we should only talk about it if you want to.
[05:05.870 --> 05:14.350]  But when you were telling me on text, I'm pretty sure that you'd done this exact same thing last time you rolled your ankle.
[05:14.690 --> 05:15.470]  No, I didn't.
[05:15.470 --> 05:15.730]  No?
[05:16.170 --> 05:19.010]  No, this has never happened before. That's why it was eventful.
[05:19.250 --> 05:28.690]  I thought that last time you rolled your ankle, you were ODing on the painkillers and you had like an anal fissure of some sort.
[05:29.050 --> 05:30.130]  No, never happened.
[05:30.730 --> 05:32.330]  What's going on with your butt, dude?
[05:32.430 --> 05:35.110]  Geoff, didn't he say that he had an anal fissure because he was taking too much?
[05:35.110 --> 05:38.490]  No, no, no, no, no. I think this is where the confusion was.
[05:39.530 --> 05:43.390]  Nick's about to chime in. He said he had something akin to that.
[05:43.590 --> 05:45.870]  Listen, Nick is the arbiter. He knows.
[05:46.150 --> 05:52.250]  What happened is when I take one of the types of pills, I stop shitting. And so everything hardens up.
[05:52.750 --> 06:00.450]  And I took the hardest, widest shit I've ever taken. And it was like icy hot was on my asshole for like hours.
[06:00.450 --> 06:05.970]  And at first it was nice. It was like kind of this cool feeling. Yeah, I didn't there was no like fissure.
[06:06.090 --> 06:12.210]  I just it was too much. It was like I squeezed something through that was too big and it fucked my asshole up for an evening.
[06:12.310 --> 06:13.130]  It wasn't fun.
[06:13.650 --> 06:14.550]  But what happened this time?
[06:14.550 --> 06:18.270]  There was no fissure. I just I was shitting blood for a few days.
[06:18.510 --> 06:19.430]  And why was that?
[06:19.810 --> 06:21.510]  Because I took too much ibuprofen.
[06:22.170 --> 06:27.350]  Why do you always take... your first thing to do whenever you roll an ankle, you pull your back while sitting.
[06:27.370 --> 06:27.950]  This was a bad one.
[06:27.950 --> 06:29.850]  You just take like a handful.
[06:29.850 --> 06:33.050]  You eat ibuprofen like it's like they're Skittles.
[06:33.370 --> 06:35.290]  No, I was following the recommended thing.
[06:35.390 --> 06:38.550]  The only thing I cut corners on was it said always take with a meal.
[06:38.650 --> 06:40.530]  And I didn't always have a meal when I was taking it.
[06:41.190 --> 06:45.290]  The first time I took it, I read the bottle and it said take with a meal.
[06:45.690 --> 06:49.050]  I had Sour Patch Kids Cherry Blasters was the only thing around me.
[06:49.070 --> 06:50.390]  I was like, I guess this is a meal.
[06:50.710 --> 06:51.670]  I had a few of those.
[06:52.030 --> 06:56.190]  It's like the time where you were trying to cleanse your palate with water, but you only had Gatorade.
[06:57.210 --> 06:58.110]  Yeah, sure.
[06:58.110 --> 07:15.590]  So I don't know offense, but if you're taking it, if you're taking ibuprofen, you said if you take an ibuprofen at the recommended prescribed dosage, either by the doctor on the bottle, taking it on an empty stomach isn't going to make your asshole shoot blood out.
[07:15.750 --> 07:17.030]  It's just going to give you a tummy ache.
[07:17.110 --> 07:24.150]  Maybe I don't think that's where I don't think that's what I don't think it's like eat on a full stomach or anal leakage will occur.
[07:24.150 --> 07:28.010]  And I don't think the Sour Patch Kids caused it either.
[07:28.210 --> 07:32.310]  I think that that might be something you want to seek medical professional help for.
[07:32.490 --> 07:33.350]  We're all good now.
[07:33.670 --> 07:34.810]  It's fine now.
[07:35.150 --> 07:35.870]  Everything's good.
[07:36.310 --> 07:37.410]  It was just like two days.
[07:37.530 --> 07:38.550]  Nothing sounds good.
[07:38.790 --> 07:43.350]  The thing that worried me was that you were asking me if I'd ever shit blood.
[07:43.470 --> 07:44.430]  And I was like, you know, it's happened.
[07:44.610 --> 07:45.550]  It's happened a few times.
[07:45.710 --> 07:46.390]  I've never done that.
[07:46.730 --> 07:49.610]  I've had like a inflamed something at one point.
[07:49.910 --> 07:50.930]  That's fucking gross.
[07:51.130 --> 07:53.650]  That's when I had to put that wax pill up my ass and it shot out.
[07:53.650 --> 07:56.850]  But then Andrew was like, I've he texted me.
[07:56.890 --> 07:57.450]  He's like, you ever done that?
[07:57.530 --> 08:01.110]  I was like, yeah, he's like, I just stopped shitting blood for three days.
[08:01.210 --> 08:02.450]  I was like, oh, my God.
[08:02.690 --> 08:04.490]  Why did you tell me after three days?
[08:04.490 --> 08:04.970]  Like what?
[08:05.070 --> 08:06.430]  What if you just dropped dead?
[08:06.470 --> 08:09.730]  Tell me at the beginning of you shitting blood so I can keep an eye on you.
[08:10.150 --> 08:11.890]  Or wait till the podcast.
[08:12.110 --> 08:17.330]  If you're going to wait till after it's over, at least wait till the podcast so you can get maximum effect.
[08:17.410 --> 08:19.350]  I didn't plan on bringing it up on the podcast.
[08:19.570 --> 08:20.590]  Well, apparently Gavin did.
[08:21.270 --> 08:23.630]  Yeah, well, I mean, I didn't I didn't know when it would end.
[08:23.890 --> 08:24.730]  I wasn't sure.
[08:25.030 --> 08:27.850]  There is a possibility of like it could have went a few different ways.
[08:28.610 --> 08:30.430]  And I felt the story had ended.
[08:30.470 --> 08:32.450]  So I felt comfortable talking about it at that point.
[08:34.170 --> 08:35.790]  Fucking whole thing going on over here.
[08:35.990 --> 08:36.850]  What, you got some dog shit?
[08:37.370 --> 08:40.630]  Well, Henry gets excited when it's time to record the podcast.
[08:40.890 --> 08:43.950]  I've I've learned that he thinks it's his job also.
[08:44.850 --> 08:49.890]  And what he started doing is when I swear to Christ, when I start recording the podcast,
[08:49.890 --> 08:55.270]  he goes and he finds a squeaky toy and then he brings it in and sits next to me and squeaks.
[08:55.510 --> 09:02.090]  Right. And and so I hid all the fucking squeaky toys today just because I thought about it ahead of time.
[09:02.570 --> 09:04.610]  And then I made sure Henry was taking a nap.
[09:04.910 --> 09:09.650]  And right as we were starting, Henry sneaks in with one of the sneaky squeaky toys I found.
[09:10.030 --> 09:12.810]  And then he goes over and he just drops it at me like, is it OK?
[09:13.010 --> 09:14.590]  And so I picked up and I put it on the thing.
[09:14.630 --> 09:16.090]  And then he just stared at it the whole time.
[09:16.090 --> 09:18.410]  While Andrew was telling his butt story, it looked like he was crying.
[09:18.590 --> 09:21.890]  So I dropped it down on him and he jumped on it and knocked the table over.
[09:25.590 --> 09:26.790]  How did he get that?
[09:27.650 --> 09:35.270]  Anyway, it was really alarming about the only like why I didn't say also it was really it was like it was bad.
[09:35.350 --> 09:36.430]  It was not bad, but it was bad.
[09:36.730 --> 09:39.110]  You don't expect to see blood when you wipe your ass.
[09:39.190 --> 09:41.730]  Geoff, you will, I hope, not have this experience.
[09:42.150 --> 09:44.150]  Yeah, so let me ask you a question.
[09:44.150 --> 09:46.650]  All right, because I want to understand what blood means, right?
[09:46.790 --> 09:49.730]  Because I just told Gavin that I've never bled from my anus.
[09:49.790 --> 09:51.210]  And I definitely think that he's gross.
[09:51.590 --> 09:53.150]  But I want to emphasize that.
[09:53.570 --> 10:01.930]  But I have like wiped too hard where you get like you get like like a little bit of pink, you know, where you're like, oh, I rubbed my asshole too hard.
[10:02.010 --> 10:04.430]  Maybe I like maybe I like a little bit of scrub.
[10:04.730 --> 10:09.930]  Like I just scrub some like some some like, you know, surface level blood out right out of toilet paper.
[10:09.930 --> 10:12.010]  No. Yeah. Is there blood?
[10:12.310 --> 10:15.150]  Like, is it coming out of your out of your little hole?
[10:15.390 --> 10:17.230]  No, I described it to get out.
[10:17.350 --> 10:21.990]  First of all, I didn't realize it had happened until after the act was done and I was going in for the wipe.
[10:22.130 --> 10:28.090]  I described it to Gavin as is like the scene when John Voight gets shot on the bridge and Miss Mission Impossible.
[10:28.390 --> 10:30.130]  And you just look down at his hands.
[10:30.250 --> 10:31.030]  They're covered in blood.
[10:31.530 --> 10:33.590]  The whole sheet was just red.
[10:33.790 --> 10:36.630]  I was like, that is not this isn't good.
[10:36.650 --> 10:38.030]  And I didn't anticipate this.
[10:38.870 --> 10:41.950]  And, uh, yeah, yeah.
[10:42.030 --> 10:46.930]  That is the immediate image that went by head.
[10:47.030 --> 10:49.530]  I was just shocked to see this red sheet.
[10:50.910 --> 10:53.190]  It's the most surprising thing in the world.
[10:53.850 --> 10:56.690]  It's absolutely like a dreadful sight.
[10:57.050 --> 11:01.650]  I'm surprised that you've never had that, Geoff, because you've got all kinds of cloggage in your ass.
[11:01.650 --> 11:08.510]  Like I said, I have definitely wiped my wiped so hard that there's been like pink streaks.
[11:08.670 --> 11:12.450]  But I've never seen blood blood anywhere near my butthole.
[11:12.630 --> 11:16.970]  Even like from the colonoscopy and all my butthole diseases and stuff.
[11:17.250 --> 11:18.490]  I don't think I've ever.
[11:18.750 --> 11:22.210]  I mean, I've had some weird stuff come out, you know, from like the medicines and stuff they take.
[11:22.290 --> 11:23.570]  It was never blood.
[11:24.770 --> 11:25.710]  It was like my...
[11:28.410 --> 11:34.630]  It was like my asshole was like an alleyway that murders kept happening on like twice a day.
[11:35.090 --> 11:36.690]  Like I couldn't tell the difference.
[11:36.790 --> 11:39.450]  But then I just like you'd review, you just like sweep the area.
[11:41.350 --> 11:42.810]  It was no good.
[11:43.030 --> 11:47.750]  So when you looked down and saw just, I assume, blood soaked paper.
[11:48.070 --> 11:50.630]  What did you say? Anything out loud or were you just like...
[11:50.630 --> 11:53.370]  I immediately went John Voight was the first thing I thought.
[11:53.370 --> 11:55.470]  And then I was just panic every time.
[11:55.810 --> 11:56.350]  Not really panic.
[11:56.450 --> 11:57.670]  It was like, that was weird.
[11:57.890 --> 11:59.370]  Hope that doesn't happen again.
[11:59.490 --> 12:00.890]  And then it happened again the next day.
[12:00.930 --> 12:02.470]  I was like, I need to look into this.
[12:03.330 --> 12:04.770]  And you did.
[12:04.990 --> 12:06.110]  You did look into it.
[12:06.290 --> 12:06.610]  I did.
[12:07.050 --> 12:09.870]  I'm surprised because usually you're an unverified wiper.
[12:09.990 --> 12:10.690]  We've established this.
[12:10.750 --> 12:12.490]  You're a vertical unverified wiper.
[12:12.950 --> 12:13.190]  Yeah.
[12:13.430 --> 12:15.970]  I mean, when it's bright red, it catches your eye.
[12:16.070 --> 12:19.410]  When the sheet changes to a color unexpected.
[12:21.190 --> 12:24.010]  I just don't want it to be one of those things where we think you're okay.
[12:24.010 --> 12:27.430]  And then like in episode 75, you're like...
[12:27.430 --> 12:27.450]  Yeah.
[12:27.610 --> 12:30.950]  You mentioned the time you had to get like a third of your colon removed or something.
[12:31.210 --> 12:31.270]  Sure.
[12:31.490 --> 12:32.670]  I remember that time I was...
[12:32.670 --> 12:32.970]  Yeah.
[12:33.170 --> 12:37.170]  Turns out I had to get like six feet of colon taken out.
[12:37.470 --> 12:38.750]  No, I'm going to get it checked out.
[12:38.990 --> 12:39.230]  Okay.
[12:39.310 --> 12:39.770]  I'm going to...
[12:39.770 --> 12:41.030]  Yeah, I'm going to get it checked out, but I'm good.
[12:41.250 --> 12:41.510]  Okay.
[12:41.870 --> 12:42.150]  Good.
[12:42.550 --> 12:43.210]  I have a few...
[12:43.210 --> 12:44.290]  I have another toilet story.
[12:44.870 --> 12:45.870]  Geoff knows about this.
[12:45.930 --> 12:46.490]  Gavin doesn't.
[12:46.610 --> 12:48.110]  This is something I was going to talk about.
[12:48.110 --> 12:49.310]  That's toilet related.
[12:49.530 --> 12:50.430]  I had...
[12:50.430 --> 12:51.150]  I experienced...
[12:51.150 --> 12:54.090]  I think I took maybe the saddest image anyone has ever taken, Gavin.
[12:55.090 --> 12:56.050]  Historically sad.
[12:56.530 --> 12:58.810]  Just a disappointing photo.
[12:59.330 --> 13:00.010]  Are you going to post it?
[13:00.010 --> 13:00.770]  Every sense of the word.
[13:00.990 --> 13:01.730]  Yeah, I'll share it.
[13:01.730 --> 13:02.170]  I'll get there.
[13:02.230 --> 13:03.090]  We got to build to it.
[13:03.390 --> 13:04.230]  Saturday night.
[13:04.690 --> 13:05.550]  Saturday night.
[13:05.950 --> 13:07.110]  This is going to be great.
[13:07.190 --> 13:07.970]  I'm going to relax.
[13:08.490 --> 13:09.450]  I'm going to have a great time.
[13:09.830 --> 13:13.690]  I bought two cupcakes from my favorite cupcake place in town.
[13:14.150 --> 13:14.970]  Two of them.
[13:15.110 --> 13:16.250]  My favorite flavor.
[13:16.770 --> 13:17.910]  This is going to be...
[13:17.910 --> 13:18.870]  What a time.
[13:19.070 --> 13:19.570]  What a treat.
[13:19.990 --> 13:21.130]  I grabbed the cupcakes.
[13:21.510 --> 13:26.390]  Andrew, before you continue, I just have to say, I think it says a lot about the nature
[13:26.390 --> 13:30.910]  of the friendship you have with Gavin, the information you choose to share with him
[13:30.910 --> 13:36.770]  on a Saturday night, and our friendship, the information you choose to share with me on
[13:36.770 --> 13:37.230]  a Saturday night.
[13:37.390 --> 13:41.490]  I have no idea what that means, but you are definitely having two different conversations
[13:41.490 --> 13:42.590]  with your friends.
[13:42.750 --> 13:44.550]  Which one is the better friendship, do you think, Geoff?
[13:44.750 --> 13:45.730]  Listen to find out.
[13:45.730 --> 13:46.730]  Well, I didn't...
[13:47.450 --> 13:47.850]  I don't know why.
[13:47.910 --> 13:50.770]  I feel like Gavin is the butt blood guy for some reason in my head.
[13:51.230 --> 13:55.130]  You did say, name something worse to drop than a cupcake.
[13:55.470 --> 13:56.770]  So I assumed you dropped one.
[13:57.090 --> 13:59.010]  So I get my cupcakes.
[13:59.510 --> 14:01.070]  I put both of them in a bowl.
[14:01.170 --> 14:04.110]  What I like to do, as I put them in a bowl, I mix them all up.
[14:04.190 --> 14:06.210]  I eat them with a spoon, like a cake.
[14:06.450 --> 14:06.930]  You are a freak.
[14:06.930 --> 14:07.450]  Yeah, I know.
[14:08.070 --> 14:08.550]  I know, dude.
[14:09.530 --> 14:10.250]  It's delicious.
[14:10.570 --> 14:11.690]  He makes cupcake soup.
[14:11.850 --> 14:12.190]  It's fucking strong.
[14:12.190 --> 14:13.470]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:13.510 --> 14:14.010]  What's wrong with you?
[14:14.270 --> 14:14.710]  No, no.
[14:14.710 --> 14:16.230]  Hear me out, okay?
[14:16.350 --> 14:17.370]  There's a reason for this.
[14:17.490 --> 14:18.090]  I need the bowl.
[14:18.210 --> 14:19.950]  If I'm not doing this, I'm not going to eat in the bowl.
[14:20.050 --> 14:22.490]  But what I was going to do is I put it in the bowl.
[14:22.810 --> 14:23.830]  I mix it all up.
[14:24.250 --> 14:26.110]  And then I'm going to have a bath.
[14:26.150 --> 14:28.470]  And I'm going to eat the cupcakes in a bath with a spoon.
[14:29.150 --> 14:30.910]  It's going to be so relaxing.
[14:31.130 --> 14:32.410]  This is my Saturday night.
[14:32.590 --> 14:33.310]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[14:33.330 --> 14:33.830]  I'm going to unwind.
[14:34.050 --> 14:35.710]  You can't keep saying...
[14:36.570 --> 14:41.830]  You can't keep saying these insane things and then just keep going like it's normal.
[14:42.730 --> 14:43.870]  What are you on about?
[14:44.330 --> 14:45.310]  What's the problem?
[14:48.550 --> 14:50.450]  The bowl wasn't big enough.
[14:50.610 --> 14:52.030]  Like it barely fit the two.
[14:52.150 --> 14:52.930]  But it was like whatever.
[14:53.070 --> 14:54.070]  This is going to be a great night.
[14:54.210 --> 14:55.690]  So I get them in the bowl.
[14:55.910 --> 14:57.210]  I go to my bathroom.
[14:58.170 --> 15:02.050]  My toilet is level with my bathtub perfectly.
[15:02.450 --> 15:04.250]  To the point where it's like a table.
[15:04.410 --> 15:05.210]  It's like a little table.
[15:05.350 --> 15:07.470]  So if I'm going to eat, I have a little drink or snack in there.
[15:07.590 --> 15:10.310]  I'll put the glass or the bowl on top of the toilet seat.
[15:10.650 --> 15:11.390]  It's perfect.
[15:11.690 --> 15:12.250]  It's like...
[15:12.250 --> 15:12.830]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[15:13.710 --> 15:14.510]  Incredibly unhygienic.
[15:14.570 --> 15:15.310]  It gets dumber.
[15:15.430 --> 15:15.870]  No, it's not.
[15:16.410 --> 15:17.290]  How is it?
[15:17.730 --> 15:18.490]  First of all, how is it?
[15:18.590 --> 15:19.350]  Because it's in a container.
[15:19.850 --> 15:20.370]  There's poo in the air.
[15:20.670 --> 15:22.150]  There's poo everywhere, Gavin.
[15:22.230 --> 15:23.750]  We live in a filthy society.
[15:24.010 --> 15:25.050]  That's always your excuse.
[15:25.670 --> 15:28.050]  All your excuse is there's poo everywhere in every room.
[15:28.310 --> 15:30.130]  But there's loads of poo in the toilet.
[15:30.470 --> 15:31.590]  It's everywhere in there.
[15:31.790 --> 15:33.070]  It's on the lid.
[15:33.250 --> 15:34.010]  I put it in a bowl.
[15:34.130 --> 15:35.210]  I put the bowl on the lid.
[15:35.350 --> 15:36.610]  It's in its own contained thing.
[15:37.190 --> 15:37.930]  Everything's fine.
[15:38.310 --> 15:39.790]  That's not the issue, Gavin.
[15:40.530 --> 15:44.090]  The problem, Gavin, is that my toilet is broken.
[15:44.250 --> 15:45.170]  It exploded.
[15:45.590 --> 15:46.770]  The lid is off.
[15:46.850 --> 15:48.230]  It's on the floor in the corner.
[15:48.530 --> 15:51.170]  The seat that you sit on is also loose.
[15:51.570 --> 15:52.090]  I need...
[15:52.090 --> 15:55.650]  Like, I can fix all these things, but it takes a moment to fix.
[15:56.030 --> 15:57.950]  I need to, like, re-bolt everything down.
[15:58.350 --> 15:59.650]  I don't feel like doing this.
[15:59.730 --> 16:02.170]  This is a relaxing cupcake time.
[16:02.750 --> 16:04.430]  I'm also going to be in there for a little bit.
[16:04.770 --> 16:05.490]  He knew it.
[16:05.490 --> 16:06.450]  He knew it.
[16:06.450 --> 16:08.270]  He knew it was broken going in.
[16:08.270 --> 16:10.590]  He's done this before, Gavin.
[16:10.690 --> 16:12.390]  So he knew the dangers.
[16:12.910 --> 16:14.970]  He has no one to blame but himself here.
[16:15.230 --> 16:19.730]  And I guarantee you the cleanup took longer than it would have to fix that fucking toilet seat.
[16:20.050 --> 16:20.510]  No, okay.
[16:20.590 --> 16:21.350]  So this is...
[16:21.350 --> 16:24.790]  I also forgot to mention I'm going to be there for a while, so I'm bringing in a few items.
[16:24.870 --> 16:25.790]  I'm bringing in my phone.
[16:26.130 --> 16:27.230]  I'm bringing in my tablet.
[16:27.690 --> 16:29.310]  And I'm bringing in my Xbox headset.
[16:29.830 --> 16:32.070]  Because I just want to listen to stuff if I want to.
[16:33.090 --> 16:33.490]  Isolated.
[16:33.850 --> 16:35.150]  So these are my items.
[16:35.150 --> 16:38.330]  I got my cupcake bowl, my tablet, my phone, and my headset.
[16:38.650 --> 16:40.650]  Someone please draw this for us.
[16:41.150 --> 16:43.570]  Andrew in the bathtub with his cupcake bowl.
[16:43.590 --> 16:44.630]  I'm just imagining Andrew.
[16:44.850 --> 16:46.010]  A still image of Andrew.
[16:46.390 --> 16:47.330]  An Xbox headset!
[16:48.110 --> 16:49.230]  One foot in the bath.
[16:49.430 --> 16:51.730]  With just his arms wrapped around all these items.
[16:51.870 --> 16:53.010]  Trying to step into the bath.
[16:53.130 --> 16:53.790]  Slipping over.
[16:54.050 --> 16:55.050]  Sushi on the floor.
[16:55.690 --> 16:56.790]  Cupcake in the bowl.
[16:57.130 --> 16:57.850]  In the toilet.
[16:58.390 --> 16:59.530]  Keyboard in the bed going,
[16:59.730 --> 17:01.230]  Come back to bed, honey.
[17:04.550 --> 17:08.270]  My headset looks like one of those helicopter, like, pilot headsets.
[17:08.370 --> 17:09.130]  It's a big thing.
[17:09.250 --> 17:11.250]  This isn't easy to move.
[17:11.710 --> 17:14.530]  So I can't fix the toilet.
[17:15.090 --> 17:19.210]  So what I do is I stack the lid on top of the seat in like a cross formation.
[17:19.690 --> 17:20.910]  And I figure, like, that'll be good.
[17:20.970 --> 17:21.330]  That's fine.
[17:21.390 --> 17:21.910]  This will be level.
[17:22.490 --> 17:23.370]  Nothing's going to move.
[17:23.710 --> 17:26.910]  I place the cupcake bowl on the toilet.
[17:27.190 --> 17:27.710]  It's fine.
[17:28.010 --> 17:28.770]  Nothing happens.
[17:28.850 --> 17:29.850]  It's perfectly balanced.
[17:29.850 --> 17:31.770]  I climb into the bathtub.
[17:32.330 --> 17:33.850]  I run the water halfway.
[17:34.630 --> 17:37.130]  I grab my tablet from the top of the toilet.
[17:37.270 --> 17:38.590]  Move it to the side of the tub.
[17:39.090 --> 17:40.750]  I then grab my headset.
[17:41.230 --> 17:47.570]  And I try to place it on the little piece, the little ceramic spot between where, like, the lid and the tank is.
[17:47.990 --> 17:48.530]  You know what I mean?
[17:48.630 --> 17:50.830]  That little area that's just, like, blank.
[17:51.150 --> 17:52.630]  It's for, like, where the lid to go up to.
[17:52.750 --> 17:54.030]  So on the top of the tank?
[17:54.390 --> 17:54.910]  No, no, no.
[17:55.050 --> 17:56.030]  On the lid level.
[17:56.130 --> 17:56.810]  Like, seat level.
[17:56.810 --> 18:00.250]  There's a ceramic spot that's intended for, like, the base of the lid.
[18:00.630 --> 18:01.210]  For it to go up.
[18:01.210 --> 18:02.770]  Like where all the piss splash lands.
[18:03.150 --> 18:03.530]  Sure.
[18:03.670 --> 18:04.810]  Like a level spot.
[18:04.970 --> 18:05.110]  Yeah.
[18:05.430 --> 18:08.110]  Like where all the butt dust and hair goes.
[18:08.490 --> 18:09.110]  Yeah, whatever.
[18:09.530 --> 18:10.350]  That's the spot.
[18:10.750 --> 18:14.030]  I place the headset on there for a moment.
[18:14.270 --> 18:15.190]  Oh my god.
[18:15.710 --> 18:17.190]  This creates momentum.
[18:17.610 --> 18:18.270]  The lid...
[18:19.690 --> 18:24.210]  The lid starts slowly rolling down the front of the toilet.
[18:24.210 --> 18:26.950]  The seat is also just wiggling all around.
[18:27.050 --> 18:27.750]  I can't do anything.
[18:27.850 --> 18:31.470]  I'm put in a very stressful position, Gavin.
[18:31.650 --> 18:33.330]  I need to decide...
[18:33.330 --> 18:34.150]  It's like an earthquake, but nothing's happened.
[18:34.150 --> 18:34.590]  It is.
[18:36.350 --> 18:38.030]  I have a choice to make.
[18:38.370 --> 18:43.710]  I can either drop my Xbox headset in the toilet and save my cupcakes.
[18:46.770 --> 18:47.370]  Or...
[18:47.370 --> 18:49.450]  I can let the cupcakes fall.
[18:49.970 --> 18:51.650]  I had to make a choice.
[18:52.990 --> 18:54.490]  I'm gonna put this in the chat.
[18:54.590 --> 18:57.270]  This is the saddest photo I've ever taken.
[19:01.790 --> 19:02.370]  Ball down.
[19:03.030 --> 19:03.990]  Icing down.
[19:04.770 --> 19:07.610]  That's an absolutely ginormous bowl.
[19:08.030 --> 19:10.090]  I like when the bowl wasn't big enough.
[19:11.190 --> 19:12.150]  No, it's...
[19:12.150 --> 19:12.890]  It's very...
[19:13.210 --> 19:15.010]  Like, the shape of it is like...
[19:15.010 --> 19:15.610]  It's not...
[19:15.610 --> 19:16.930]  Cupcake's the size of your head!
[19:17.030 --> 19:17.610]  No, it's...
[19:17.610 --> 19:18.390]  No, that's deceiving.
[19:18.470 --> 19:19.370]  It's like a vase!
[19:19.730 --> 19:20.330]  No, it's not.
[19:20.850 --> 19:21.350]  It's not.
[19:21.370 --> 19:22.150]  It's a lampshade.
[19:22.150 --> 19:23.770]  It's an eight-gallon bowl.
[19:23.970 --> 19:25.970]  It's like a vat of cake.
[19:26.270 --> 19:28.030]  The shape of cupcakes...
[19:28.030 --> 19:29.210]  It doesn't fit well.
[19:29.410 --> 19:30.890]  It barely fit the tip.
[19:31.070 --> 19:32.390]  The size of a fishbowl!
[19:32.630 --> 19:33.850]  It's not a bowl cake.
[19:35.570 --> 19:37.310]  Well, it's good for the mixing.
[19:37.510 --> 19:39.590]  It's like the shape of it, it stays in the middle.
[19:39.970 --> 19:40.790]  But it fell.
[19:41.190 --> 19:43.510]  So now that you've heard that story, Gav, what do you think?
[19:44.350 --> 19:47.970]  Who's got the better deal between you and I?
[19:48.450 --> 19:51.970]  Oh, I don't know.
[19:52.170 --> 19:54.110]  That is an infuriating story.
[19:54.690 --> 20:00.550]  Because every week I'm here saying, I'm imagining you living in a filthy, disgusting mess.
[20:00.690 --> 20:02.970]  And every week you tell me, no, it's fine.
[20:03.030 --> 20:04.950]  It's very, you know, there's a lot of cleanliness going on.
[20:05.430 --> 20:06.570]  Load of old shit, Andrew.
[20:07.950 --> 20:10.450]  I don't even know where to start with some of these things.
[20:10.630 --> 20:13.270]  Dude, you want to know something even sadder real fast before we do that?
[20:13.270 --> 20:24.290]  When Andrew sent me this story, or told me this story, my girlfriend and I got on Uber Eats and we scoured Vancouver Island for cupcakes to send to him as a replacement cupcake.
[20:24.550 --> 20:31.310]  There was no option available from like Saturday to, I want to say like Tuesday or Wednesday.
[20:31.630 --> 20:34.830]  They were like, all the cupcake places are shut the fuck down right now.
[20:35.090 --> 20:36.670]  That's a great point that Geoff makes.
[20:36.990 --> 20:38.890]  Geoff suggested, go get some new cupcakes.
[20:39.330 --> 20:41.550]  I thought, you know what, I could do that, possibly.
[20:41.550 --> 20:45.430]  It's only seven o'clock. It's probably closed, but I'll check.
[20:45.850 --> 20:49.090]  I looked them up. They closed at four on Saturday.
[20:49.670 --> 20:52.270]  They would not open again until Wednesday afternoon.
[20:52.730 --> 20:56.210]  I was the furthest point from getting new cupcakes, essentially, from this place.
[20:56.630 --> 20:59.330]  Dreadful. The worst time for this accident to happen.
[20:59.590 --> 21:01.770]  Well, it's landed face down perfectly, it seems.
[21:02.230 --> 21:06.070]  But if you lifted the bowl up, would the top of that pile be edible?
[21:06.570 --> 21:08.110]  Well, that's, here's the thing, Gavin.
[21:08.350 --> 21:10.210]  I was in the tub, it was half filled with water.
[21:10.210 --> 21:16.550]  I just looked at it, I took the photo, and I thought, I'm not capable of dealing with this at this time.
[21:17.070 --> 21:20.010]  That bowl laid like it did for the next two hours.
[21:20.590 --> 21:21.630]  It just stayed there.
[21:22.110 --> 21:27.350]  Two hour down bowl, I got out of the tub, I did everything else first before I dealt with the bowl.
[21:27.610 --> 21:29.490]  Is the bowl fine?
[21:29.790 --> 21:30.570]  Yeah, the bowl's fine.
[21:30.910 --> 21:31.850]  No chips or anything?
[21:32.190 --> 21:33.690]  No, no chips, nothing.
[21:34.470 --> 21:37.850]  Bowl is all good. Bowl is great.
[21:37.850 --> 21:42.270]  It luckily landed, if you noticed, it landed largely on the towel.
[21:42.730 --> 21:44.930]  So it was very easy to pick up.
[21:45.170 --> 21:49.250]  It didn't really stick, I don't know if the two hours re-hardened, like it separated?
[21:49.670 --> 21:52.790]  Like the icing on the towel divided from the thing?
[21:53.010 --> 21:56.670]  It was a very clean, easy cleanup to do.
[21:56.810 --> 21:58.350]  Oh dude, today's Wednesday.
[21:58.790 --> 21:59.350]  It is Wednesday.
[21:59.730 --> 22:00.950]  Are you gonna get replacement cupcakes?
[22:01.410 --> 22:03.150]  Oh shit, that's a great point.
[22:03.430 --> 22:05.810]  I didn't even consider that, I should. I'll do that after we record.
[22:05.810 --> 22:08.450]  You've got three hours before they close, right?
[22:08.570 --> 22:12.050]  Yeah, we're fine. I'll get three hours.
[22:12.370 --> 22:15.350]  Now the question, did I eat the cupcakes, is the big question.
[22:15.630 --> 22:16.390]  I don't think you did.
[22:16.470 --> 22:16.790]  Did you?
[22:17.070 --> 22:18.650]  You don't think I did? Gavin, what do you think?
[22:19.010 --> 22:20.210]  Oh, you certainly did, yeah.
[22:20.510 --> 22:21.750]  Oh, I absolutely ate the cupcakes.
[22:22.210 --> 22:25.430]  Yeah, you cut the top off and you ate the underneath of the top.
[22:25.690 --> 22:28.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got rid of the icing.
[22:29.170 --> 22:31.750]  You ate a two hour old floor cupcake.
[22:32.470 --> 22:33.810]  Bathroom floor cupcake.
[22:33.810 --> 22:36.750]  Bathroom floor cupcake, and you took the icing off, which is the best part.
[22:36.950 --> 22:40.010]  It didn't really land on the floor, it landed on a towel.
[22:40.170 --> 22:44.410]  A towel on a bathroom floor is no cleaner than the floor.
[22:44.810 --> 22:48.030]  Well, here's the thing, it was a hand towel, I'm not a hand towel guy.
[22:48.150 --> 22:49.310]  I don't really use hand towels.
[22:50.510 --> 22:53.330]  Can we have a, I'm not a blank guy.
[22:54.130 --> 22:56.830]  Socks, hand towels, meatballs.
[22:58.410 --> 22:58.850]  Jesus.
[22:59.230 --> 23:00.230]  We need a full list.
[23:00.230 --> 23:03.910]  So I had to do like a whole thing of like, well, where did that hand towel come from?
[23:03.950 --> 23:05.870]  And what did, I didn't really think about it until after.
[23:05.970 --> 23:08.250]  I cleaned up, I think, soap with that hand towel.
[23:08.650 --> 23:09.670]  I think that was a soap use.
[23:09.730 --> 23:13.270]  I knocked over a soap dispenser and soap spilled everywhere.
[23:13.410 --> 23:16.170]  And I think I used that to collect the soap.
[23:16.610 --> 23:16.970]  I believe.
[23:17.090 --> 23:21.630]  You knock stuff, I just need to, I want to live with you for a month.
[23:21.710 --> 23:22.450]  Just to watch.
[23:22.690 --> 23:25.010]  I'll be completely unintrusive, I'll just sit in the corner.
[23:25.430 --> 23:26.250]  I just want to watch.
[23:26.250 --> 23:26.810]  Yeah.
[23:27.010 --> 23:33.210]  To clarify, Gavin, the soap dispenser fell when I also knocked down the sushi lid that eventually took me out.
[23:33.290 --> 23:34.610]  It was all part of the same collapse.
[23:34.950 --> 23:36.330]  This was not several collapses.
[23:36.830 --> 23:37.810]  This is one act.
[23:37.930 --> 23:38.990]  Was that different to the cabinet?
[23:39.430 --> 23:39.910]  The cabinet.
[23:40.250 --> 23:40.950]  Which one was the cabinet?
[23:41.090 --> 23:42.930]  That was the cabinet that was knocked over before.
[23:43.030 --> 23:43.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:43.570 --> 23:44.450]  Oh, yeah.
[23:44.690 --> 23:45.110]  It was causing a shimmy.
[23:45.310 --> 23:47.570]  That would have been, no, yeah, that was a different time.
[23:47.670 --> 23:48.650]  The cabinet was a different time.
[23:48.710 --> 23:48.890]  Okay.
[23:48.930 --> 23:50.570]  But that, those are the two main ones.
[23:50.850 --> 23:54.810]  I will say, Gav, both of our stories were toilet centric, at least.
[23:54.810 --> 23:56.250]  Well, it's because he lives in there.
[23:56.330 --> 23:58.310]  He has everything he needs in the bathroom.
[23:59.990 --> 24:03.210]  How are any stories supposed to happen anywhere else?
[24:06.270 --> 24:09.270]  I don't have a waffle maker on my end table anymore.
[24:09.890 --> 24:10.650]  That's a good thing, right?
[24:11.370 --> 24:12.550]  I moved it to the kitchen.
[24:12.710 --> 24:13.230]  I've got two.
[24:13.390 --> 24:16.310]  I've got one in my closet, unopened, and I've got one in my kitchen now.
[24:16.450 --> 24:17.850]  How the fuck are you going to make waffles now?
[24:17.870 --> 24:19.070]  Are you going to go all the way to your kitchen to make waffles?
[24:19.070 --> 24:19.330]  I know.
[24:19.490 --> 24:20.610]  I've got to go all, yeah, I know.
[24:20.790 --> 24:22.150]  I'm a ridiculous human being.
[24:22.310 --> 24:22.590]  Super.
[24:22.590 --> 24:27.530]  Somebody on the subreddit created like a list of information regarding my room.
[24:42.930 --> 24:48.050]  Starting a business can seem like a daunting task, unless you have a partner like Shopify.
[24:48.530 --> 24:51.450]  They have the tools you need to start and grow your business.
[24:51.450 --> 24:56.830]  From designing a website, to marketing, to selling, and beyond, Shopify can help with everything you need.
[24:57.270 --> 25:02.310]  There's a reason millions of companies like Mattel, Heinz, and Allbirds continue to trust and use them.
[25:02.710 --> 25:05.650]  With Shopify on your side, turn your big business idea into...
[25:11.230 --> 25:15.230]  I'm like trying to piece together like a scene, like it was a crime scene just based on what was said.
[25:15.590 --> 25:18.650]  And one of the things was mentioning that I have Pam on the table.
[25:19.150 --> 25:20.050]  And I was like, that's ridiculous.
[25:20.110 --> 25:20.950]  Oh, no, I still do.
[25:20.950 --> 25:21.510]  It's still there.
[25:21.590 --> 25:22.570]  The Pam is still there.
[25:22.790 --> 25:25.770]  I don't have the waffle maker, but I still have a Pam container.
[25:26.450 --> 25:28.190]  But the Keurig is still in there.
[25:28.410 --> 25:29.530]  Oh, Keurig is still in there.
[25:29.610 --> 25:29.770]  Yeah.
[25:30.250 --> 25:31.410]  Yeah, Keurig is still doing good.
[25:31.910 --> 25:32.250]  It's great.
[25:32.430 --> 25:33.010]  It's insane.
[25:38.090 --> 25:39.510]  We all chew gum.
[25:39.790 --> 25:40.710]  I assume.
[25:40.850 --> 25:42.930]  I have no data to support that.
[25:43.210 --> 25:44.630]  It's one of those old adages.
[25:44.790 --> 25:45.110]  Is it?
[25:45.170 --> 25:45.830]  I don't know.
[25:46.190 --> 25:48.130]  But not all gum is created equal.
[25:48.290 --> 25:49.390]  That I do know.
[25:49.390 --> 25:54.270]  Some might come in fancy packaging, but they only cover up bad breath.
[25:54.410 --> 25:57.870]  Others are loaded with sugar that can wreak havoc on your teeth.
[25:58.330 --> 26:02.930]  Luckily, the oral care experts at Quip have made a gum that stands out from the pack.
[26:03.290 --> 26:05.490]  And one that can help prevent cavities.
[26:05.890 --> 26:08.470]  Back in the old days, people would say, are you brushing your teeth?
[26:08.590 --> 26:10.610]  Now they're going to say, are you chewing your teeth?
[26:10.830 --> 26:11.390]  Okay, good.
[26:11.830 --> 26:16.150]  It was only a few short years ago that Quip reinvented the toothbrush for the modern age.
[26:16.150 --> 26:17.090]  They've done it again.
[26:17.350 --> 26:19.310]  This time, for chewing gum.
[26:19.750 --> 26:23.410]  Well, they've launched a new gum that's actually good for your oral health.
[26:23.590 --> 26:28.190]  And it comes with a dispenser that'll remind you of the one-click candy you loved as a kid.
[26:28.510 --> 26:31.490]  Except it's good for your teeth, unlike most candy.
[26:31.910 --> 26:35.590]  It dispenses one piece of candy at a time.
[26:36.030 --> 26:37.250]  One at a time, dispenser.
[26:37.450 --> 26:37.990]  Click, click, click.
[26:38.430 --> 26:43.390]  Quip gum can help prevent cavities and freshen breath when chewed for 20 minutes after eating.
[26:43.390 --> 26:48.130]  It's sugar-free and has tooth-friendly xylitol with zero calories.
[26:48.430 --> 26:49.970]  Mmm, xylitol.
[26:50.490 --> 26:54.510]  And to satisfy your taste buds, Quip added a long-lasting mint flavor,
[26:54.930 --> 26:59.410]  crunchy tri-layer design, and stamped it all with the classic Quip tongue.
[26:59.690 --> 27:03.690]  The slim travel-ready dispenser, available in five colors, metal or plastic,
[27:04.130 --> 27:06.430]  packs and protects up to 10 gum pieces at a time.
[27:06.630 --> 27:09.490]  And it fits into just about any purse or pocket for on-the-go.
[27:09.890 --> 27:13.050]  And, in a world where we all need to be extra safe and hygienic,
[27:13.050 --> 27:15.810]  the quick-release button means you can still share with friends.
[27:16.070 --> 27:17.890]  No wrappers, hands, or hassles.
[27:18.270 --> 27:21.070]  Remember, though, it's not a substitute for brushing and flossing,
[27:21.210 --> 27:23.490]  but it is a great support for your oral health.
[27:23.750 --> 27:29.030]  Pair it with a Quip electric toothbrush for kids and adults, refillable floss, and more great products.
[27:29.550 --> 27:32.770]  And if you go to getquip.com slash face right now,
[27:32.890 --> 27:36.110]  you can get a free plastic dispenser with any refill plan.
[27:36.410 --> 27:39.690]  That's a free dispenser at getquip.com slash face.
[27:39.690 --> 27:44.670]  Spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P dot com slash face.
[27:45.070 --> 27:51.250]  You can also find the Quip electric toothbrush, refillable floss, and more in the oral care aisle at your local Walmart.
[27:51.770 --> 27:53.290]  Quip, the good habits company.
[27:53.710 --> 27:55.890]  I shop online all the time.
[27:56.150 --> 27:59.770]  Last night, at about 1.30 in the morning, I was shopping online.
[28:00.370 --> 28:03.150]  It's true. I bought a stand-up paddle board.
[28:03.470 --> 28:05.490]  Who knows if I'll use it, but that's not the point.
[28:05.490 --> 28:10.490]  The point is, we've all seen that promo code field taunt us when we go to checkouts.
[28:10.810 --> 28:14.950]  But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is now a thing of the past.
[28:15.250 --> 28:20.170]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[28:20.490 --> 28:28.710]  It supports over 30,000 stores online, which range from sites that have tech and gaming products to fashion, food delivery, you name it.
[28:29.010 --> 28:31.630]  Here's how it works. Imagine you're shopping at one of your favorite sites.
[28:31.630 --> 28:36.570]  When you go to checkout, the Honey button drops down, and all you do is click Apply Coupons.
[28:36.830 --> 28:40.650]  Wait a few seconds, and it searches for coupons. It can find for that site on the internet.
[28:40.790 --> 28:41.310]  It's like...
[28:42.010 --> 28:45.890]  And then if Honey finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop.
[28:46.310 --> 28:52.190]  Well, I just mentioned about a stand-up paddle board that I may have bought, let's just say, on a whim.
[28:52.570 --> 28:56.090]  Will I use it? Chances are pretty good I'll use it twice.
[28:56.310 --> 28:59.530]  Will I use it a third time? I wouldn't put my money on it.
[28:59.530 --> 29:03.350]  But what I did put my money on is Honey Savings when I got it.
[29:03.710 --> 29:08.370]  Honey has found us over 17 million members, over $2 billion in savings.
[29:08.590 --> 29:12.050]  If you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up missing out on free savings.
[29:12.190 --> 29:14.630]  It's literally free, and it installs in a few seconds.
[29:14.790 --> 29:18.430]  And by getting it, you're doing yourself a solid and supporting this podcast.

[29:26.350 --> 29:34.090]  Do you guys ever do dumb little things with technology?
[29:36.290 --> 29:37.510]  I don't know how to describe it.
[29:37.870 --> 29:42.990]  I did the dumbest little thing this morning, and I'm still embarrassed about it and kind of mad at myself for it.
[29:43.050 --> 29:44.390]  And I don't know what to do about it.
[29:44.630 --> 29:48.310]  Earlier today, I was on my cell phone, and I was reading Reddit.
[29:48.970 --> 29:54.130]  I was reading a story off of Reddit, or the comments of a story off of Reddit.
[29:54.930 --> 30:01.010]  And you know how on an iPhone, an email alert will come down, and it'll swipe down from the top?
[30:01.530 --> 30:04.290]  And when it swiped down, it covered half of what I was reading?
[30:04.890 --> 30:11.830]  And I just, out of the blue, without thinking at all, just my natural reaction was to try to blow it away.
[30:11.830 --> 30:17.970]  And I did. I went and tried to blow away the email alert on my fucking phone.
[30:19.470 --> 30:19.910]  No.
[30:20.650 --> 30:22.330]  Have you ever done anything like that?
[30:22.750 --> 30:24.630]  No, I've never blown at my phone.
[30:27.190 --> 30:28.870]  I can't believe I did it.
[30:29.110 --> 30:30.250]  What do you think, a relief?
[30:30.550 --> 30:33.790]  I don't know. No, it was in my way, and I tried to blow it out of the wind.
[30:36.090 --> 30:37.530]  Oh, that's gonna be a feature.
[30:37.530 --> 30:43.590]  They could add that. If the mic detects a gust of air, it should blow the notifications off the screen.
[30:43.730 --> 30:46.550]  It should, dude! It's brilliant, right? It's way better.
[30:47.030 --> 30:54.790]  My stupidity should be an app, the fuck-off app, to get rid of shit when you're trying to read,
[30:55.090 --> 30:59.450]  fucking patented, f*** face app, first f*** face app right there, the fuck-off app.
[31:00.110 --> 31:01.670]  Get out of my fucking screen, I'm trying to read.
[31:01.910 --> 31:04.710]  How's it gonna be an app, though? You have to open the app to blow on it.
[31:05.330 --> 31:07.310]  I don't know, you just open the app and it runs in the background.
[31:07.630 --> 31:08.930]  I don't know.
[31:09.550 --> 31:10.990]  That is incredibly stupid.
[31:11.750 --> 31:15.350]  Geoff, I have one that's not that. It's also cupcake-related.
[31:15.850 --> 31:16.450]  Oh, I'd love to hear it.
[31:16.610 --> 31:23.970]  It's equally dumb. I had the cupcake photo on my tablet, and my phone was in front of my tablet.
[31:24.090 --> 31:28.630]  I just woke up. I was gonna take a photo on my phone, and so when I opened the photo app,
[31:28.850 --> 31:34.210]  it immediately just was the cupcake photo, and I was very confused how my phone was able to see
[31:34.210 --> 31:37.890]  what was happening in my bathroom. I was spooked by this for a good second.
[31:38.350 --> 31:42.030]  And then I was like, what is going on? How's my phone camera in the bathroom?
[31:42.290 --> 31:47.430]  And I moved my phone camera a little bit, and it was still just different bathroom,
[31:47.530 --> 31:49.430]  like it expanded because it was zoomed in on the bowl.
[31:49.670 --> 31:51.050]  I was like, what's going on?
[31:51.430 --> 31:55.430]  And then I realized, I'm an idiot, I just have that photo open on my tablet,
[31:55.610 --> 31:57.290]  and that's what I'm looking at through my phone.
[31:57.670 --> 32:01.430]  Is this podcast, as a weekly event in our lives, making us way dumber?
[32:01.430 --> 32:04.690]  I don't think it's making us dumber, I think it's just calling attention
[32:04.690 --> 32:07.450]  to something that's naturally happening in our lives.
[32:07.470 --> 32:09.510]  It's documenting our dumb, that's the thing.
[32:09.950 --> 32:11.010]  Documenting the decline.
[32:11.270 --> 32:18.330]  Andrew, I do have to ask, what is better about a mashed up bowl of cupcake than eating a cupcake?
[32:18.910 --> 32:23.290]  It's just, it's like, the spoon is nice, and if you get a premium cupcake,
[32:23.590 --> 32:27.570]  you know, there's stuff on the inside, it's not just like all, what would you call the material?
[32:27.750 --> 32:29.090]  Cake, I guess? Obviously?
[32:29.090 --> 32:32.310]  It's not all just pure cake, there's like, there's filling in it,
[32:32.610 --> 32:33.830]  and you just mix it all up, it's good.
[32:34.150 --> 32:36.910]  That's a Black Forest cupcake, you got some cherry in the center,
[32:37.230 --> 32:38.810]  just kind of spread it around, it's great.
[32:39.130 --> 32:40.050]  You know what I just realized?
[32:40.430 --> 32:40.610]  What?
[32:40.950 --> 32:44.170]  We're 30-something minutes into this fucking podcast today,
[32:44.350 --> 32:49.310]  and we've spent the entire time talking about bathrooms and toilets and shit going on in bathrooms,
[32:50.070 --> 32:56.010]  and nobody has asked, at any point, about the stupid port-a-potty that I was threatened with,
[32:57.290 --> 32:58.470]  Oh yeah, what's the latest?
[32:58.470 --> 33:01.770]  if I've received it or not, any of that nonsense.
[33:01.790 --> 33:04.610]  Which, by the way, the audience was like,
[33:04.750 --> 33:10.090]  is Andrew really shitting on Geoff for salad dressing a fucking bit right now?
[33:10.290 --> 33:11.110]  Eat the pencil, Andrew!
[33:11.230 --> 33:13.530]  And I was like, oh yeah, that's a good point, and audience, thank you.
[33:13.810 --> 33:19.510]  There's two, I mean, there's a difference between eating a pencil and a $999 gift.
[33:20.690 --> 33:22.130]  Those are two different things.
[33:22.250 --> 33:26.910]  You've not asked, at any point, did I receive the port-a-potty?
[33:27.990 --> 33:31.170]  Geoff, did you receive the port-a-potty? Is it well?
[33:32.610 --> 33:34.290]  Tell me about the port-a-potty, Geoff.
[33:34.790 --> 33:39.490]  I will say, before you do, quickly, I got panicky and thought you redirected it,
[33:39.550 --> 33:42.650]  and I was like, fuck, how can I, because you did, on the call, you changed the address,
[33:43.070 --> 33:48.410]  so I went back into your recording, and I analyzed to make sure all was good.
[33:48.590 --> 33:51.050]  You listened to Geoff's raw audio from last week?
[33:51.070 --> 33:55.110]  I listened to Geoff's raw audio from when he gave the person the address to confirm.
[33:56.430 --> 34:02.190]  How about this? Here, you guys keep talking for a second, I'll be back.
[34:02.450 --> 34:02.650]  Okay.
[34:03.190 --> 34:05.890]  It's a good point, though, because Geoff was dodging this content,
[34:06.370 --> 34:10.270]  but at no point did he take anyone to court and hire lawyers over it,
[34:10.650 --> 34:14.270]  so it's maybe considered less of a content dodge than the pencil.
[34:14.590 --> 34:16.850]  I mean, I feel like you're just explaining content.
[34:17.190 --> 34:18.890]  That was all content that came from that.
[34:19.130 --> 34:21.110]  If I just ate the pencil, that content doesn't exist.
[34:21.410 --> 34:23.410]  What do you mean? That's content.
[34:23.790 --> 34:27.050]  Well, no, I'm saying there's more content made from not taking it
[34:27.050 --> 34:29.270]  than if I would have just ate the pencil, that would have been boring.
[34:29.830 --> 34:32.070]  People love yelling at me about eating the pencil.
[34:32.330 --> 34:34.970]  It's true. And I guess, I mean, after what you did with the salad cream,
[34:35.050 --> 34:37.430]  it probably would have been as frustrating.
[34:37.430 --> 34:39.430]  I still don't understand what was wrong with the salad cream.
[34:39.530 --> 34:43.010]  I feel like I lived up to what was requested. I confirmed that it's decent.
[34:43.150 --> 34:46.770]  Do you really not understand what you did with the salad cream?
[34:46.810 --> 34:48.070]  No, well, I feel like the question is...
[34:48.070 --> 34:50.430]  You made a salad that doesn't exist that we can't...
[34:50.430 --> 34:51.790]  Oh, I can't get into it again.
[34:51.790 --> 34:53.690]  Okay, alright, can you guys hear me?
[34:54.330 --> 34:55.870]  I just...
[34:55.870 --> 34:57.750]  How do I sound?
[34:57.870 --> 34:59.430]  It sounds a bit echoey, Geoff.
[35:01.270 --> 35:06.110]  Well, that's because I'm now recording from inside the porta-potty.
[35:08.090 --> 35:14.970]  I'm imagining a still image of the front of your house with muffled speech coming out of a pink porta-potty.
[35:15.110 --> 35:15.710]  Is it on the drive?
[35:17.110 --> 35:19.550]  Yeah, it's where my girlfriend parks.
[35:23.230 --> 35:24.830]  I gotta be honest with you, it's...
[35:25.390 --> 35:26.710]  I hate to admit it.
[35:26.830 --> 35:28.470]  Wow, it sounds like shit.
[35:28.690 --> 35:30.770]  But it's kind of growing on me in here.
[35:31.210 --> 35:32.290]  It's pretty spacious.
[35:32.730 --> 35:34.210]  It's a nice color pink.
[35:34.810 --> 35:35.930]  It's very clean.
[35:36.410 --> 35:37.730]  It's still got the plastic on.
[35:37.750 --> 35:38.830]  Can you take a selfie in there?
[35:38.930 --> 35:42.210]  Hold on a second, I'm sending you guys a photo right now, then I'll take a selfie.
[35:43.130 --> 35:45.930]  It's just taking forever because I'm outside, you know.
[35:47.370 --> 35:51.990]  And I don't want to do this for too long because I imagine the audio is pretty rough.
[35:52.230 --> 35:55.110]  Wow! That's a nice porta-potty, Geoff!
[35:55.110 --> 35:56.590]  It looks so nice!
[35:56.930 --> 35:57.410]  Wow!
[35:59.750 --> 36:00.570]  That's great!
[36:01.130 --> 36:02.470]  What's that thing? The sink?
[36:02.910 --> 36:05.150]  I think it's the urinal. I think he's got a little urinal in there.
[36:06.270 --> 36:07.690]  It's got a urinal in it!
[36:07.910 --> 36:08.390]  Wow!
[36:09.570 --> 36:13.670]  This truly is the greatest gift I've given anybody. Look at how nice that is!
[36:13.670 --> 36:18.670]  It's got like a ventilation pipe coming up so I guess the poo smell doesn't go inside.
[36:18.830 --> 36:19.730]  That's amazing!
[36:20.630 --> 36:21.770]  You went all out, Andrew!
[36:22.190 --> 36:24.030]  I did! Look at me!
[36:24.930 --> 36:26.110]  You're welcome, Geoff!
[36:26.270 --> 36:27.630]  Andrew, it's a lovely gift.
[36:27.950 --> 36:32.990]  And it's been kind of great off the bat.
[36:33.410 --> 36:40.430]  When the guy in the 18-wheeler delivered it and asked me why the fuck I had been avoiding them and dodging them,
[36:40.710 --> 36:42.950]  I had to explain to him that it was a prank.
[36:42.950 --> 36:45.790]  He totally got it. He got excited about it.
[36:45.990 --> 36:47.850]  He offered to buy it from me.
[36:47.930 --> 36:50.610]  So I have a $600 offer on the table.
[36:50.870 --> 36:52.070]  How much? Hello?
[36:52.830 --> 36:53.530]  Can you guys hear me?
[36:53.790 --> 36:55.430]  It's cutting out a little bit for me.
[36:55.610 --> 36:56.110]  Can you guys hear me?
[36:56.150 --> 36:58.930]  Yeah, it's cutting out a little bit, but you're good.
[36:59.390 --> 37:00.690]  Alright, hold on. I'll just leave it.
[37:02.450 --> 37:07.310]  He didn't wire his phone for internet.
[37:08.730 --> 37:09.350]  Is it working?
[37:13.410 --> 37:14.670]  Are you okay, Geoff?
[37:14.670 --> 37:16.070]  Is Geoff gone?
[37:16.270 --> 37:18.070]  How did he record that bit?
[37:18.430 --> 37:19.190]  I don't know.
[37:20.870 --> 37:22.150]  What the fuck?
[37:28.620 --> 37:31.080]  It's a portable studio. This is great.
[37:32.020 --> 37:33.860]  Did he flush the phone down the toilet?
[37:34.020 --> 37:34.580]  What the hell was that?
[37:34.960 --> 37:36.760]  I don't know. He's gone.
[37:37.540 --> 37:38.380]  Where's Geoff?
[37:39.940 --> 37:42.660]  Do you think he fell over on the couch?
[37:42.900 --> 37:43.800]  No, I'm back.
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.400]  It was obvious that we couldn't communicate, so I switched back to my house.
[37:48.400 --> 37:49.860]  That was so good.
[37:51.300 --> 38:01.020]  What I was going to say is, as soon as I explained to the guy that it was a prank, which he thought was very cool for some reason, he offered me $600 on the spot for it.
[38:01.160 --> 38:02.680]  Why didn't you just shift it to him?
[38:03.180 --> 38:09.060]  I could have been like, don't even take it off the truck, just give me $600 in cash and move on with your life.
[38:09.060 --> 38:18.640]  And it would have essentially been Andrew wiring me a $600 cash gift with a $400 processing fee.
[38:18.820 --> 38:21.540]  That's even better money laundering than the Zimmer cards.
[38:21.740 --> 38:22.300]  Oh my god.
[38:22.720 --> 38:28.900]  But instead I said, no, no, no, here, take it out. I took his number down so I can always sell it to him if I want to.
[38:29.440 --> 38:31.320]  But it's kind of grown on me.
[38:31.720 --> 38:32.500]  So here's what I'm thinking.
[38:32.600 --> 38:36.140]  I'm going to have John Mace pick it up, take it to Rooster Teeth.
[38:36.540 --> 38:38.460]  Maybe we turn it into a recording booth.
[38:38.460 --> 38:41.100]  I could line it with acoustic foam.
[38:41.420 --> 38:42.560]  We can do something with it.
[38:42.800 --> 38:47.180]  I was even thinking, we have an album in search of a purpose, right?
[38:47.580 --> 38:50.420]  The audience wants us to make a vinyl album, we don't know what to do.
[38:50.700 --> 38:55.320]  What if we get Wes, the Rooster Teeth photographer, who's super talented, too talented to work for us,
[38:55.500 --> 38:59.840]  and we take the port-a-potty and we take it somewhere and we set it up somewhere majestic.
[39:00.540 --> 39:03.080]  Like on a hill overlooking all of Austin.
[39:03.080 --> 39:04.140]  Like a nice vista.
[39:04.640 --> 39:05.660]  Beautiful vista or something.
[39:05.660 --> 39:09.620]  And we have Wes take this gorgeous, picturesque photo.
[39:10.040 --> 39:13.140]  And then we slap that on an album cover and we call it like,
[39:13.200 --> 39:14.940]  F*** Face, Talkin' Shit.
[39:15.480 --> 39:17.340]  Or like, Down with the Chronicles.
[39:17.740 --> 39:18.880]  Flushin' it, or whatever.
[39:19.140 --> 39:22.380]  And then that's the point of the album.
[39:22.780 --> 39:28.700]  It's either us recording from inside the port-a-potty, or us just talking shit about people.
[39:29.320 --> 39:29.860]  Or something.
[39:30.480 --> 39:31.980]  We could call it the Pink Album.
[39:32.520 --> 39:34.100]  There's all kinds of cool stuff we could do.
[39:34.100 --> 39:36.120]  I love this idea, Geoff.
[39:36.200 --> 39:38.640]  And I'm so glad that you've pivoted to this direction.
[39:38.980 --> 39:42.140]  Because I was planning counter-attacks for your $600 idea,
[39:42.760 --> 39:45.300]  and I really like this direction more than what I had planned.
[39:45.620 --> 39:48.160]  Oh, I think I'm gonna make way more money than the $600 if I do it this way.
[39:49.660 --> 39:52.500]  So have you shat in it yet or anything?
[39:52.640 --> 39:53.580]  Or are you just gonna keep it clean?
[39:54.000 --> 39:54.660]  No, it's pristine.
[39:55.060 --> 39:57.880]  Dude, as a matter of fact, it was shrink-wrapped.
[39:58.300 --> 40:00.420]  I didn't open it up until two hours ago.
[40:00.420 --> 40:03.600]  Could you climb down the bog hole and sit in there?
[40:05.220 --> 40:06.800]  Yeah, I think I probably could.
[40:07.800 --> 40:10.100]  We've gotta have a picture of your head poking out the toilet.
[40:10.820 --> 40:11.960]  That's what I want.
[40:14.380 --> 40:15.960]  Okay, I'll tell you what.
[40:17.600 --> 40:19.580]  It's never gonna get any cleaner than it is now, right?
[40:20.780 --> 40:27.400]  Why don't I, after the podcast is over, I'll hop out and I'll see if I can get in there and get a photo taken.
[40:27.400 --> 40:30.460]  You should film yourself trying to get in because that's gonna be good.
[40:30.680 --> 40:32.560]  Okay, yeah, I'll do that.
[40:35.120 --> 40:38.580]  What a great gift. What an expensive gift.
[40:38.980 --> 40:44.480]  I gotta be honest, Andrew, I was resistant to it just because of the size and I didn't know what the fuck to do with it.
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.920]  But it was a bit like a blessing in disguise. Hopefully not a Trojan horse, but a blessing in disguise.
[40:49.020 --> 40:49.880]  That's what it feels like now.
[40:50.180 --> 40:52.500]  Yeah, I'm genuinely jealous.
[40:52.500 --> 40:57.920]  Dude, if we keep that nice, we could have that on the convention floor at RTX.
[40:58.560 --> 40:59.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[40:59.800 --> 41:01.540]  People could come and sit in it, take a picture.
[41:02.140 --> 41:10.140]  100%. You know what we could do? We could put it on the floor and we could pump speakers into it and we could have like a little three-minute f***face episode.
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.520]  And the only way to hear it is to go sit on the toilet, put the headphones on.
[41:14.520 --> 41:17.820]  We're not even gonna have headphones because that'd be gross, but just sit on the toilet and listen to it.
[41:17.820 --> 41:21.040]  And then you get like a little special f***face episode right there on the show floor.
[41:21.040 --> 41:22.260]  I think that's perfect.
[41:22.360 --> 41:23.480]  The hardest thing is gonna be my dick.
[41:23.480 --> 41:24.660]  The hardest thing will be to get people not to shit in it.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.360]  Oh, right. Yeah, that part too. We can bolt that down.
[41:27.720 --> 41:28.260]  We could.
[41:28.660 --> 41:28.780]  Yeah.
[41:30.180 --> 41:38.980]  So, your original plan, Geoff, is now off the table. You're not going to weaponize this and just drop it off at the other people who work on the show? Their driveways?
[41:39.380 --> 41:41.180]  Well, I'd never say never, you know?
[41:41.280 --> 41:48.760]  I also think that there's a lot of power in, I guess, creating more misery for those of you that work on the show with me.
[41:48.760 --> 41:55.020]  And I'm always open to do that, but my current sights are more aspirational than that.
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.920]  I see. Well, I found out about your offer. You talked about the 600. I was aware of that.
[42:00.080 --> 42:00.580]  600 bucks!
[42:00.920 --> 42:12.080]  Yeah, and that's a great deal. So, immediately, I went into, because I don't know if you remember, I made hats at one time that I talked about making a profit off of, and you were very against this idea.
[42:12.340 --> 42:15.540]  So, I was trying to think, like, well, how could I screw up Geoff's deal?
[42:15.800 --> 42:16.100]  Okay.
[42:16.100 --> 42:26.960]  And my first thought was, I could just fill the shitter with cement and make it extremely heavy and unmovable. Just make it as annoying as possible for you to do anything with.
[42:27.120 --> 42:28.240]  The immovable toilet.
[42:28.460 --> 42:29.860]  The immovable toilet.
[42:30.060 --> 42:30.360]  Okay.
[42:30.360 --> 42:35.920]  That'd be pretty annoying, yeah. Then I thought about, like, you could even tip it over and use it like a mold and just fill it all with cement.
[42:35.920 --> 42:41.900]  And I came to the conclusion that would murder somebody. That would fall on someone and they would die. I cannot do that.
[42:42.200 --> 42:52.940]  But then I thought about, at that time, you said the hat was such a great item. It was so magnificent. It was beautiful. It belonged in a museum. I couldn't dare possibly sell it.
[42:53.380 --> 43:02.920]  So, I have been emailing essentially every museum in Texas, explaining the situation and seeing if any of them would take it as an exhibit.
[43:02.920 --> 43:09.120]  And we're making progress. We're finding... I've gotten some replies. I don't have a place yet, but it's a possibility.
[43:09.520 --> 43:14.520]  So, I'm happy that we're going this other angle. I don't think I'll continue to pursue the museum thing, necessarily.
[43:14.680 --> 43:15.760]  It's always a nice backup, though.
[43:16.060 --> 43:16.960]  Yeah, it's good as a backup.
[43:17.280 --> 43:17.980]  Yeah, it's a great backup.
[43:17.980 --> 43:27.760]  You know, we need to maximize this porta-potty. I was just thinking, like, what kind of... could we make mini porta-potties that we could sell? Like, little pocket-potties?
[43:27.860 --> 43:29.740]  What? Like a toy, you mean?
[43:29.820 --> 43:31.800]  What, so that, like, you shit in on the go?
[43:31.800 --> 43:38.200]  No, it'd be more like a tchotchke, right? Like a keychain or something. I don't want it, like, I don't... I mean, I guess we could do that.
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.500]  I mean, you'd have a miniature porta-potty. Like, it's possible. I've sent you a mini porta-potty.
[43:42.780 --> 43:43.140]  That's true.
[43:43.200 --> 43:48.380]  Can you imagine how disgusting a real-sized human turd would look in a very tiny porta-potty?
[43:48.460 --> 43:49.180]  Oh, no.
[43:49.500 --> 43:51.180]  Like a man-sized poo.
[43:51.520 --> 43:53.880]  Well, wasn't that the opening shot of Jackass 2?
[43:57.920 --> 44:01.000]  Wasn't it like Dave England shitting on a tiny toilet or something?
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.140]  There was...
[44:02.140 --> 44:02.280]  Yeah.
[44:02.920 --> 44:05.220]  Was it the third one where he shot the volcano?
[44:11.020 --> 44:17.540]  I have a question for everybody here. I'm just curious. I asked this question to some other people. I was surprised by their answer.
[44:18.200 --> 44:24.800]  What is... you order a pizza. Okay, this is the scenario. You get a pizza, you order it, you leave it on the counter, you leave it wherever you leave it.
[44:25.320 --> 44:29.860]  What is the longest you've gone back to eat a pizza? A piece of pizza that has been left out.
[44:30.940 --> 44:33.140]  Left out, like not put in the fridge.
[44:33.380 --> 44:34.500]  Not put in the fridge.
[44:34.660 --> 44:36.260]  Is it wrapped in cellophane or anything?
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.760]  No, it's just in the box. It's in the box. You've left it out, not in the fridge. It's just room.
[44:41.760 --> 44:43.940]  Am I heating it up or am I just grabbing it?
[44:43.980 --> 44:51.480]  No, you're just... it doesn't... whatever. I think both are fine. Just how much time has it spent out? What is the longest gap you've gone?
[44:51.520 --> 44:52.300]  No more than an hour.
[44:52.660 --> 44:53.580]  No more than an hour.
[44:53.720 --> 44:59.460]  I'm probably good for... I would say I would eat a pizza that's been out on the counter for two or three hours.
[44:59.460 --> 45:00.560]  But no more than that.
[45:00.700 --> 45:01.960]  Two or three hours?
[45:02.000 --> 45:09.320]  Like 6 p.m., we got a pizza. At 9, I'm still hungry. There's like one slice of pizza left on the counter. I'd probably still eat it.
[45:09.400 --> 45:11.760]  But I wouldn't go any later than that. I wouldn't go past bedtime.
[45:12.240 --> 45:14.480]  Nick said 12 hours. Eric said two days.
[45:14.960 --> 45:15.300]  Oh my god.
[45:15.300 --> 45:17.920]  Two days? Just unrefrigerated? That can't be great.
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.240]  That's got bacteria growing on it. That's not healthy.
[45:20.440 --> 45:22.440]  It's gonna start shriveling. It'll be dehydrated.
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.580]  It's like... the botulism is making salmonella at that point.
[45:27.420 --> 45:28.680]  I asked this question.
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.100]  That's how COVID started.
[45:30.440 --> 45:36.560]  Yeah, maybe one hour is a little bit too harsh. Maybe like... I'd push it to two, but I rarely want to have pizza for lunch and dinner again.
[45:37.560 --> 45:42.780]  Alright, so Andrew's clearly left us out for like a week and a half. What have you done? What have you done, you disgusting animal?
[45:44.740 --> 45:46.120]  I asked this question.
[45:46.540 --> 45:47.760]  You blended it and put it in a bowl.
[45:48.480 --> 45:52.900]  I expected most people to be like, Eric, like maybe three days? Two to three days?
[45:53.460 --> 45:57.760]  Almost everyone was like, maybe I left it out overnight once and ate a slice in the morning.
[45:57.760 --> 46:04.980]  The longest duration, I would say, between leaving a pizza out and then coming back to eat it is like 10 days, I want to say?
[46:05.600 --> 46:08.420]  What are you talking about, Andrew?
[46:08.640 --> 46:10.240]  That's why your asshole's bleeding!
[46:10.680 --> 46:14.380]  Yeah, your liver's gonna fail, your kidneys are gonna explode.
[46:14.820 --> 46:18.480]  Your body's fighting off contagions left and right because you're ingesting it.
[46:18.480 --> 46:21.740]  This was months ago, unrelated to what happened.
[46:21.920 --> 46:23.220]  I wish you would have said years ago.
[46:23.360 --> 46:23.980]  Months ago?
[46:24.680 --> 46:25.640]  10 days?
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.500]  It was probably like 10 days.
[46:27.500 --> 46:30.620]  You can order something from China in less time!
[46:32.020 --> 46:35.820]  I could get something through the UK post-Brexit faster!
[46:36.020 --> 46:36.380]  Probably not.
[46:37.600 --> 46:40.800]  Nick said it's become cardboard when it sits at that point.
[46:41.580 --> 46:47.000]  Yeah, but it was Little Caesar, so it was always cardboard. There's no going down, you're already at the bottom.
[46:47.300 --> 46:48.280]  Pizza jerky.
[46:48.280 --> 46:54.280]  Nah, it was not great. Listen, it was like 2.30 a.m. in the middle of the week.
[46:54.600 --> 46:59.480]  It was on my filing cabinet, I had one piece left in a box, it was just there.
[46:59.880 --> 47:01.180]  And I was hungry.
[47:01.440 --> 47:01.940]  What was on it?
[47:02.200 --> 47:04.100]  Just pepperoni. It was a pepperoni slice.
[47:04.720 --> 47:07.680]  The pepperoni's probably fine, because pepperoni's cured.
[47:08.240 --> 47:11.280]  But, oh god, the fucking...
[47:11.280 --> 47:13.440]  It was like eating a giant crouton.
[47:13.780 --> 47:17.080]  How are there not flies laying eggs in that after a week?
[47:17.080 --> 47:18.080]  No, it was...
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.120]  Because they'd already hatched.
[47:19.320 --> 47:19.800]  Everything was contained.
[47:21.920 --> 47:22.800]  At that point.
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.360]  He's waiting a week, he's like, I'm just waiting off the larva. Once that's gone, I'm gonna eat it.
[47:29.080 --> 47:30.300]  I'm dry-aging it.
[47:32.240 --> 47:38.740]  Andrew, no one has... where did you go to school? Why did no one teach you not to eat old, old frickin' food?
[47:38.820 --> 47:41.160]  Well, no, no, no, no, I know you're not supposed to.
[47:41.380 --> 47:45.200]  It was a rare... yeah, it was a rare time, and it was a very small amount. I was hungry.
[47:45.200 --> 47:48.100]  Why not just throw a hot dog in your closet and cook one up?
[47:48.440 --> 47:54.060]  Because I caused the fire alarm to go off last time I did that, and I'm very scared of using that machine ever since then.
[47:56.340 --> 48:01.560]  I need my fan blowing, it's a whole process if I want to cook dogs in my room. I don't do it.
[48:01.700 --> 48:03.420]  We need to get you a frickin'...
[48:03.420 --> 48:08.040]  I could do it outside, actually. I've got a balcony, I could... that's actually a good idea.
[48:08.040 --> 48:15.320]  We need one of those life alert thingies around your neck from when you eat like a three week old milkshake and your gut starts dissolving.
[48:15.320 --> 48:17.660]  I've never had a milkshake. That's not gonna happen.
[48:19.840 --> 48:23.320]  Wait, what did you say? He hasn't had a milkshake. Oh, come on.
[48:23.740 --> 48:27.240]  He had the milk allergy, didn't he? Yeah, I had the milk allergy, so I never had a milkshake.
[48:27.340 --> 48:28.420]  That no longer applies somehow.
[48:28.820 --> 48:34.960]  Should I try... 7-Eleven has a Slurpuccino, I haven't tried coffee since the last time on this show.
[48:34.960 --> 48:41.600]  It wasn't coffee. It wasn't coffee. Should I go for the Slurpuccino? That's coffee and a Slurpee, that might be like the next step.
[48:41.840 --> 48:43.980]  Yeah, pour it in the cake bowl, that'll be perfect.
[48:45.120 --> 48:47.320]  That'll be the milk to your weird cake cereal.
[48:47.960 --> 48:49.760]  There's no milk in it, apparently.
[48:50.120 --> 48:53.440]  Okay. So here's what it boils down to, Gavin.
[48:54.140 --> 48:58.820]  Andrew texts you on a random day and it's about a bloody anus. Yeah.
[48:59.200 --> 49:02.340]  Andrew texts me and it's he's sad because he dropped his food.
[49:03.900 --> 49:12.680]  I don't understand how you choose to funnel information to people. It's just so weird.
[49:13.240 --> 49:18.580]  Like, where's the... I'm thinking about like when you hack in Cyberpunk and you're like... you know what I mean?
[49:19.240 --> 49:20.640]  Like, I don't understand.
[49:21.060 --> 49:27.880]  Or like the pipes in Biohazard when you're trying to put the pipes together. How does that information flow from A to B?
[49:28.180 --> 49:30.840]  You want an honest answer to that? There was a thought process to it.
[49:30.840 --> 49:36.080]  I thought, I haven't talked to Geoff in a few days. I miss Geoff. This is the thing that just happened in my life.
[49:36.380 --> 49:40.760]  I'll talk to Geoff about it. I want to talk to Geoff. I didn't view it as show content at that time.
[49:41.020 --> 49:42.880]  It was just a thing that was happening. Yeah.
[49:43.100 --> 49:47.320]  And then you said, oh, this feels like show content. And I was like, I guess it is. I guess I'll talk about it on the show.
[49:47.660 --> 49:49.580]  That's why I talked to you about it. Then I asked Gavin.
[49:49.860 --> 49:55.980]  Maybe that's where the filing cabinet comes in. It hits the Andrew newsroom and then he has to file it into different...
[49:55.980 --> 49:57.840]  Who is he going to text this to?
[49:58.460 --> 50:06.380]  That is fair. I will say in Andrew's defense, most of the time he texts me now, I respond with, is this going to be content or could this be content?
[50:06.840 --> 50:09.360]  And if so, stop talking to me. Shut up.
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.700]  We have a show to make. It has destroyed our friendship. It really has.
[50:17.040 --> 50:19.520]  Gavin, I can't remember the last time I talked to you on the phone.
[50:19.880 --> 50:22.260]  Well, why would we? Yeah, I guess that's true.
[50:23.880 --> 50:25.220]  I guess that's true.
[50:27.360 --> 50:33.880]  I guess another... oh, I got a... we got a prototype for a product. We got a beef bracelet prototype. Somebody sent me.
[50:34.760 --> 50:42.680]  Someone else made it? Yeah, someone made it. It's not really a beef bracelet. There's a video of the making of. I wish they would have just taken a photo of it.
[50:43.700 --> 50:50.340]  Here's a link. They made a Slim Jim sunglasses. It's not quite the beef... we talked about a whole clothing line.
[50:50.340 --> 50:55.980]  This is something that came out of the FaceBits email I've made, which is doing very well.
[50:56.540 --> 50:59.060]  3D printer, SLA printer.
[50:59.620 --> 51:05.500]  It's like a little clip that you slip the Slim Jim into, made by somebody who emailed in.
[51:05.940 --> 51:08.240]  Dude, this is a hell of a setup. It's a great setup.
[51:08.900 --> 51:13.020]  This guy's like a scientist. I don't even know how to stuff it. Look at all the different gloves he's got.
[51:13.220 --> 51:17.820]  Oh, look at that. Automatically lowering. That's fucking... that's nice.
[51:17.820 --> 51:23.700]  I want that and I don't even know what it is. Yeah. Is it like setting it, like sealing it somehow? I believe so.
[51:23.980 --> 51:32.260]  Oh, I love it. Look at him go. I mean, I think the bracelet's better, but it's not like we can't... they both can't exist.
[51:32.560 --> 51:36.400]  No, yeah. I mean, we talked about doing a whole clothing line. This kid's a genius.
[51:36.720 --> 51:43.180]  Now he's water cutting some aluminium. Oh, yeah, you're going... Gavin didn't fast forward like I did. He's watching the whole video.
[51:43.720 --> 51:46.540]  Should I not? No, that's fine. Go for it. It's a good video. It's a great video.
[51:46.540 --> 51:51.700]  Yeah, so this... was this my suggestion of having the Slim Jims in the glasses? I don't know.
[51:51.960 --> 51:55.300]  If you want it to be, take credit for it. Who cares? Yeah, you could own it. Sure. Of course.
[51:55.560 --> 52:01.380]  That's pretty much exactly what I imagined. Yeah. Wow. It's even got the f***ing Face logo on it.
[52:01.680 --> 52:11.340]  Yeah. It's great. I made that bits email. There are so many remarkably talented people in ways that, like, I don't even know how we'll use, but it's amazing.
[52:11.340 --> 52:19.060]  I've been amazed at some of the stuff people have latched on to. The audience, first off, we talked about it earlier, they love the idea of us making an album.
[52:19.400 --> 52:31.860]  Maybe we'll make the pink album. Maybe it'll be something else. They also, they absolutely f***ing love all of the crazy different ways that you can come up with to put meat on stuff.
[52:31.940 --> 52:40.160]  That's awesome. I'm amazed at how they've latched on to that. They're brilliant. Also, the NFT, going stronger than ever. I checked on it today.
[52:40.600 --> 52:49.080]  The lady or the person that bought it, they put it up for sale for, you know, I sold it for one tenth of one dollar, E-dollar, whatever the f*** it is.
[52:49.320 --> 53:02.320]  Ethereum. Somebody offered her one, 0.175 for it, which is a 0.075 increase. She has not accepted that offer. It sat there alone for like two weeks.
[53:02.320 --> 53:14.760]  Just the other day, somebody offered 0.176 for it. So that's one thousandth of a dollar more, I think. So it's, hey, these things are picking up.
[53:15.220 --> 53:18.680]  But Ethereum isn't a dollar. They're like two grand or whatever.
[53:19.060 --> 53:27.080]  No, I don't think it's that bad, but maybe. I don't know. Anyway, speaking of like ridiculously talented audience members and community members,
[53:27.080 --> 53:40.620]  I've been meaning to mention for a while that we got contacted a while back by a person who actually works at one of the companies that makes trading cards, baseball cards, basketball cards, the company Panini,
[53:41.160 --> 53:46.780]  and sent us some of their designs and some of the cards, which are just phenomenal. And I can share them with you guys.
[53:47.240 --> 53:53.460]  This person named Jody, I don't know if they want me to read the letter or not, so I won't, but they did say to tell Andrew to eat the pencil.
[53:53.460 --> 54:01.220]  And they sent along like three, four, five, six cards that they designed from like Dan Marino, John Morant.
[54:02.060 --> 54:11.520]  Literally, they are a baseball card artist and they design baseball cards, which is like the coolest job in existence. I wasn't aware.
[54:11.660 --> 54:15.340]  And anyway, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate that. Thanks for reaching out, Jody.
[54:15.340 --> 54:24.200]  And let it be said from this point on that F***face Jody is the, probably the preeminent card designer on Earth.
[54:24.360 --> 54:32.340]  Probably, I would say, the Van Gogh, if you will, of baseball card and basketball card design.
[54:32.680 --> 54:38.720]  And so it's really cool that the greatest living card artist reached out to us. Appreciate that.
[54:38.960 --> 54:39.460]  That's awesome.
[54:40.520 --> 54:47.320]  You know what's crazy about that? We made those bats. We didn't know how they would do. We just made the 50.
[54:47.520 --> 54:54.160]  Obviously, I was miserable burning them all and they sold out like in a couple seconds.
[54:54.300 --> 54:55.920]  Like it was pretty much instant. That was cool.
[54:56.360 --> 55:04.220]  So when we made the next round of bats, we made six times the amount of bats that we made the first time, figuring that might be enough.
[55:04.440 --> 55:06.920]  And they once again sold out instantly.
[55:07.480 --> 55:14.880]  So the next thing we make, we're gonna have to, I'll try to make sure that we, I don't know, we create enough of it for the demand.
[55:15.240 --> 55:19.780]  But I guess that's the question too. Like where do we go? We have the original burned bats.
[55:20.120 --> 55:25.820]  We now have the black bat with the card. Is next the bat knob?
[55:26.220 --> 55:27.520]  Yeah, I think we got a thousand knobs.
[55:28.180 --> 55:29.020]  A thousand knobs?
[55:29.140 --> 55:29.920]  A thousand knobs.
[55:30.240 --> 55:32.040]  Yeah, I think a thousand knobs is a nice little...
[55:32.800 --> 55:33.680]  I was afraid you'd say a thousand knobs.
[55:33.680 --> 55:36.300]  It's a nice name for a drop, isn't it? The thousand knob drop?
[55:36.300 --> 55:37.860]  Yeah, I like that.
[55:38.180 --> 55:39.400]  Here's what I was gonna say.
[55:41.080 --> 55:43.260]  I've been working with merch for a while.
[55:44.140 --> 55:50.140]  They cannot find a source to make only bat knobs.
[55:52.520 --> 55:55.660]  It's just not a thing that's done in 2021.
[55:56.240 --> 55:58.580]  However, it has been discussed.
[55:59.620 --> 56:05.660]  I really fucking hate that I'm offering this, but I want to provide the audience with their goddamn bat knobs, right?
[56:05.660 --> 56:14.320]  And I refuse to accept that we can't market and sell a product that our audience is desirous of.
[56:14.800 --> 56:16.560]  Dare I say it, demanding of.
[56:18.200 --> 56:22.660]  So I mentioned to them that if we were to get a couple hundred bat knobs...
[56:23.420 --> 56:26.460]  A couple hundred bats. Just get our hands on a couple hundred custom-made bats.
[56:26.800 --> 56:30.620]  I would be willing to buy a saw and saw them off.
[56:30.920 --> 56:33.380]  And then I guess I would need to sand the ends smooth.
[56:33.380 --> 56:36.320]  And that's the way we could get to the five...
[56:36.320 --> 56:38.080]  I was gonna say five hundred, but you said a thousand.
[56:38.320 --> 56:39.560]  Which seems like way too much work.
[56:41.260 --> 56:42.840]  I just don't know what else to do.
[56:43.260 --> 56:44.260]  I like that idea.
[56:44.340 --> 56:46.560]  I don't want to personally make five hundred bat knobs.
[56:46.980 --> 56:49.340]  But I don't know how else we're gonna get there.
[56:49.360 --> 56:51.400]  Are they mini bats again?
[56:51.640 --> 56:52.600]  Are they knobs from mini bats?
[56:52.820 --> 56:55.400]  No. I think these knobs would be full-size, right?
[56:55.780 --> 57:01.620]  So what are you gonna do with a thousand most of a bat that's left over?
[57:01.620 --> 57:03.760]  That's a great fucking question, Gavin. I don't know.
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.660]  That's another thing. We would have to determine what do we do with noblest bats.
[57:08.060 --> 57:10.940]  Maybe you could like wallpaper a room with them or something cool.
[57:11.100 --> 57:15.000]  Or we turn them into... maybe we can figure out a way to sell them to the audience.
[57:16.300 --> 57:17.860]  Like world's biggest toothpick.
[57:19.540 --> 57:22.140]  Yeah. Or a deck chair made out of 16 bats.
[57:22.600 --> 57:24.640]  Yeah. Or vampire steaks.
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.100]  Oh yeah, that works.
[57:26.620 --> 57:27.040]  I don't know.
[57:27.760 --> 57:30.980]  That's gonna be way worse than you signing the tip of a bat.
[57:30.980 --> 57:34.960]  I don't know. I don't know. Well, okay. In my head it's not.
[57:35.400 --> 57:40.140]  You're gonna need to... you're gonna definitely need a big fat bench and an electric saw.
[57:40.240 --> 57:42.400]  You're not gonna do that by hand anytime soon.
[57:42.520 --> 57:45.740]  No. I would need a chop saw. Here's the way I'm thinking.
[57:45.960 --> 57:51.420]  I get a chop saw. I put it on my workbench. I dial in. I get everything set up right.
[57:51.520 --> 57:53.680]  I just take the knobs, the bats. I stick it in.
[57:53.920 --> 57:55.040]  You need to make a knob guide.
[57:55.040 --> 58:00.100]  Knock it off. Put a new one. I do that a thousand times. That seems easy.
[58:00.260 --> 58:04.760]  And then I get a belt sander and then I just sand the edges so that there's no splinters or anything.
[58:05.580 --> 58:08.800]  Do you think anyone on earth would have wrecked that many bats?
[58:09.320 --> 58:09.620]  No.
[58:09.760 --> 58:11.220]  You might have a world record if you do that.
[58:12.020 --> 58:14.940]  Do you have any idea what a thousand bats is gonna look like?
[58:15.320 --> 58:15.680]  No.
[58:15.920 --> 58:17.200]  We can't do a thousand.
[58:17.420 --> 58:18.720]  A load of pallets. No.
[58:19.400 --> 58:24.060]  Well, you know what happens when you only put up a few hundred. They're gone within one minute. Less than one minute.
[58:24.060 --> 58:25.020]  That's true.
[58:25.100 --> 58:27.700]  Let's sell something that is on the site for more than a minute.
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.120]  Okay, well come over and help me make fucking knobs then.
[58:32.660 --> 58:35.080]  But I didn't say we should go... that was all you.
[58:35.760 --> 58:40.540]  You guys have been wanting knobs forever. I'm trying to make... I'm trying to come up with a solution for the audience.
[58:40.680 --> 58:44.240]  I don't want to make the fucking things, but nobody else on earth is gonna do it for us.
[58:44.280 --> 58:46.100]  Well, here's the thing. Here's the way I see it.
[58:46.440 --> 58:50.060]  Eric is a producer and that means to make something.
[58:50.420 --> 58:52.140]  I'm not doing that. You can just move on.
[58:52.140 --> 58:55.760]  We're at the end. I was typing out that we're at the end of the episode, so we don't even need to get...
[58:55.760 --> 58:58.580]  We don't even need to broach the subject of me doing anything with the bats.
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.920]  Huge waste of time. Huge... not even content. Not even gonna begin to go there.
[59:04.060 --> 59:08.280]  So you could... you just go to like the next... go to like... how can we make Andrew do it?
[59:08.400 --> 59:09.500]  Just go to like the next person.
[59:09.640 --> 59:16.120]  Eric is in almost every episode and he is yet to have to burden these signatures or burnings or bat creations.
[59:16.300 --> 59:18.160]  So I think it's Eric's turn for the thousand knobs.
[59:18.640 --> 59:20.020]  All right. Sounds like it's settled.
[59:20.920 --> 59:21.700]  Andrew, are you still there?
[59:21.700 --> 59:25.160]  Yeah, no, I'm here. I just... there's another way... I would love to help Geoff.
[59:25.220 --> 59:27.920]  If I was in Texas, I would help you with those bat knobs.
[59:28.120 --> 59:30.900]  Well, it's... maybe the audience will chime in, I would say.
[59:31.160 --> 59:33.740]  Maybe the audience will chime in and say, you know what, Geoff, don't worry about it.
[59:33.780 --> 59:37.980]  We don't want the knobs that bad. Just sell us... just make a new t-shirt or something.
[59:38.820 --> 59:40.080]  And they'll let me off the hook.
[59:40.180 --> 59:46.360]  The great thing about this, though, is if you do them by... if you eyeball them, every knob will be a slightly different length.
[59:46.620 --> 59:47.960]  And I think that's a great point.
[59:48.100 --> 59:49.380]  It's like a fingerprint, like a snowflake.
[59:49.380 --> 59:52.220]  Yeah, that's great. That's a great point, Gavin.
[59:52.720 --> 01:00:00.060]  I wonder how the knobs will change over time. Like, will knob 2 be vastly different from knob 806?
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.880]  That was certainly the case with burning the numbers. So I would assume that by like 700, I will have it down.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.540]  If... if... could we sell the broken bats?
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.520]  No, how'd this work? I was thinking like it'd be... if you bought a knob, you can then buy a broken bat,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.340]  and you'd have to try to hope to match the bat with the knob. Like a real Cinderella type scenario.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:30.280]  Everyone at RTF can bring their knobs and bats and try to match up which knob was from which bat.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.900]  That's a great idea!
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.400]  Be like the world puzzle.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.520]  We'll sell knobs, and then like a month later, we'll sell knobless bats.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.140]  If you didn't get a knob, buy the bat it came from.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.460]  Oh, this is so stupid.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:53.460]  Well, anyway, I gotta go crawl in a toilet, so you guys have a good day. Thanks for listening.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.860]  Like and subscribe, do a review, tell a friend, all that shit.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.340]  This has been F*** Face. See you next week!
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:01.900]  Bye!
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:02.340]  Bye!
