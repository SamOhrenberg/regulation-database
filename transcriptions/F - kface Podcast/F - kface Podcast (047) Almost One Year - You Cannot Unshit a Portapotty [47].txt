[01:07.870 --> 01:11.630]  I hung out with Jack the other day and he mentioned that he was listening to F*** Face,
[01:11.930 --> 01:15.630]  and then Eric was like, you sounded like Jack, and I took it like an insult,
[01:15.850 --> 01:19.550]  and now I'm self-conscious about how I start the show because I don't want to insult Jack.
[01:19.750 --> 01:22.870]  What? I don't know how to start the show anymore.
[01:23.170 --> 01:26.290]  What do you mean? You've never learned how to begin with. This is a weird dilemma.
[01:26.810 --> 01:31.670]  That's an excellent point. Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Jack I F*** Face
[01:31.670 --> 01:39.490]  podcast. Episode 47. My name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always, Gavin Free. And how would you like
[01:39.490 --> 01:44.230]  to be referred to this week, sir? Oh, however you want. Both names work. Yeah. We'll go
[01:44.970 --> 01:51.190]  with Peyton Sommer this week. Oh, nice. Yeah, that's great. I actually for how I have that
[01:51.190 --> 01:57.690]  bits email, I have it. I think it's Andrew Slatt. It reads like Andrew Raymond Sommer Peyton,
[01:57.690 --> 02:02.930]  which is great. It's a great structure. It's a very like how I should look at it.
[02:03.190 --> 02:07.110]  Hey, so I want to get back into what we were just talking about, Andrew. Before
[02:08.450 --> 02:14.850]  Gavin, we were dancing dangerously on the precipice of doing content before the show
[02:14.850 --> 02:20.350]  started. Oh, shit. Luckily, we stopped. How early were you guys here again then? Because I was here
[02:20.350 --> 02:26.070]  at three. Andrew and I were both here. We were here about 15 minutes ago. Just talking. Yeah.
[02:26.070 --> 02:29.090]  We were talking about you a lot. And we'll cover it with you later.
[02:30.290 --> 02:32.510]  Don't worry. It's coming from a place of love.
[02:34.490 --> 02:38.910]  But we don't want to do it on camera right now. Oh, that's kind of you. Yeah. Anyway,
[02:39.030 --> 02:43.530]  Andrew was telling me that we were talking about how we're almost at the one year anniversary of
[02:43.530 --> 02:49.770]  the show, or at least the 52 episode anniversary of the show. And he was saying that he was really
[02:49.770 --> 02:54.090]  excited that for the anniversary, he wants to fire off his fire extinguisher. He was trying to
[02:54.090 --> 02:58.810]  figure out ways to do it safely. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. I figured it'd be like a cool,
[02:58.930 --> 03:03.230]  exciting thing that was going to be a surprise at the time. But now I guess we'll just talk about
[03:03.230 --> 03:06.410]  it because I brought it up. What do you mean safely? Like you don't want to inhale it? Yeah.
[03:06.450 --> 03:10.370]  Well, no, I don't want it to shoot all over my apartment. I don't want it to be a thing I have
[03:10.370 --> 03:13.990]  to clean up because they can really spread it. They can be a nightmare from what I've seen.
[03:14.170 --> 03:17.650]  So do you want to talk about? Well, first off, if you don't want to talk about this, we can.
[03:17.850 --> 03:20.230]  No, no, no, no, no, no. We've already gone so far.
[03:20.230 --> 03:26.250]  We could also we could also just beep that whole part out. No, no, we could just talk about it.
[03:26.730 --> 03:31.490]  I'd be curious to hear if Gavin had any ideas on how to accomplish this or maybe people would know
[03:31.490 --> 03:36.230]  a better way to do this. Just shut your eyes and hope for the best. No, that's not I could do that
[03:36.230 --> 03:40.710]  any day. That doesn't solve any problems. You're just explaining firing the extinguisher. I mean,
[03:40.710 --> 03:45.590]  you've cleaned up worse. You had to clean up an upside down bowl full of cupcake. I really don't.
[03:45.590 --> 03:48.370]  I mean, that was an easy clean. It landed on the towel.
[03:48.950 --> 03:52.010]  You cleaned it. You cleaned it with your damn mouth is why it was easy.
[03:52.170 --> 03:55.110]  No, no, no, no, no, no. It took you two hours to clean it.
[03:55.330 --> 03:59.010]  It wasn't emotionally easy, Andrew. It definitely was not.
[03:59.170 --> 04:02.830]  It was emotionally devastating. And I'm not going to get out of my comfy,
[04:03.030 --> 04:06.910]  warm bath to deal with that cupcake in that time. I'd have to reset everything.
[04:08.810 --> 04:12.870]  I don't I don't think I told you, Geoff. I told Gap. Well, you may have been together,
[04:12.870 --> 04:18.410]  so you may have heard by proxy. But I the next week, literally one week later, same cupcake,
[04:18.590 --> 04:23.010]  same place, walking them up to my room because I got made fun of for the bowl. I put them on a
[04:23.010 --> 04:29.610]  plate. They're both on a plate. And I'm in my room and I fall. I fell with the cupcakes landed on
[04:29.610 --> 04:35.530]  the bed. They're fine. Save the cupcakes. But I just can't. It's dangerous. Those cupcakes are
[04:35.530 --> 04:37.630]  apparently dangerous for my health. What do you trip on?
[04:37.810 --> 04:42.850]  I stepped on like an adapter I had for a wall, like a converter. It was just on the floor and
[04:42.850 --> 04:47.870]  I stepped on it. My ankle immediately panicked and I just fell on the bed. But it led more into a
[04:47.870 --> 04:53.930]  conversation of if there is an item in my hands and I will fall, I will break both my legs before
[04:53.930 --> 04:59.390]  I let that item. It does not matter. The item immediately becomes a million times more valuable,
[04:59.550 --> 05:04.230]  even if it's like a glass of water. And it doesn't matter if it has value or not. It's just I will
[05:04.230 --> 05:10.190]  never I immediately go into save the item mode. When I see your floor in my head, it's the floor
[05:10.190 --> 05:17.550]  of a six year old child. It's just like Legos and plastic shards, crayons, puzzle pieces. Yeah,
[05:17.690 --> 05:23.730]  there's it's just a just candy wrappers everywhere. I mean, it's not true, but I'm also looking at a
[05:23.730 --> 05:29.570]  candy wrapper on my desk. But it is not. This is this is an exception. And Pam and a waffle bomb.
[05:29.830 --> 05:33.710]  The Pam, the waffle bomb is gone. Here's what I was gonna say, Andrew. Here's what I think you
[05:33.710 --> 05:37.610]  should do. I do. I do. I appreciate Gavin just saying close your eyes and hope for the best.
[05:37.610 --> 05:42.250]  But I think you need to I think you need to prepare for contingency. It is going to make a
[05:42.250 --> 05:46.870]  bit of a mess. That's not a reason not to do it. In fact, I would argue it's a reason to do it.
[05:47.290 --> 05:52.690]  However, I think you need to allow yourself some some plausible deniability. So here,
[05:52.790 --> 05:58.730]  let me construct a scenario for you. OK? OK. We want to set off the fire extinguisher. We
[05:58.730 --> 06:04.710]  want to mitigate the amount of cleanup and damage. And we need to have a good exit story in case
[06:04.710 --> 06:10.650]  things go sideways and the police or the fire department gets called out for what they think
[06:10.650 --> 06:14.830]  is some sort of a fire related emergency. So here's what we do. Here's what we do. We don't
[06:14.830 --> 06:19.610]  know what's going to happen. Here's what we do. Crank up the hot dog warmer in the closet,
[06:20.010 --> 06:25.530]  go in, shut the door, set off the fire extinguisher in the closet. That should eliminate
[06:25.530 --> 06:30.490]  most of the mess. But if for some reason the power is so strong, it blows the door off
[06:30.490 --> 06:35.670]  or whatever, and it causes some sort of a catastrophe, you can always tell the police
[06:35.670 --> 06:40.250]  or the fire department. My hot dog machine caught on fire and I was trying to put it out.
[06:40.350 --> 06:46.370]  OK, so your solution is to add a fire hazard to make it more valid. It doesn't really prevent
[06:46.370 --> 06:51.390]  any damage. Yes, because it gives him an out. It gives him a story out, which is what he's
[06:51.390 --> 06:57.110]  going to need. An out from the police who will be deployed, obviously, to any squeeze of a fire
[06:57.570 --> 07:01.050]  extinguisher. Whatever, whoever, whatever, public. I don't know how it works in Canada.
[07:01.150 --> 07:05.690]  Whoever shows up to help. It's not in public, though, is it? He's not. No. He's not blasting
[07:05.690 --> 07:10.710]  it in a supermarket. I don't know what you know, but he's in an apartment complex. It sounds like
[07:10.710 --> 07:13.990]  Eric says it sounds like I might not know how it works in America either. I don't mean cops,
[07:14.090 --> 07:20.790]  cops. I just mean like EMS, whoever comes when there's a problem. The other day when Andrew's
[07:20.790 --> 07:26.070]  fire alarm went off, sirens showed up. We heard it. It was on the fucking podcast. Whoever drove
[07:26.070 --> 07:30.830]  that siren, that's who I'm preparing for. That's a fire alarm. Pressing a fire extinguisher doesn't
[07:30.830 --> 07:36.190]  have anything to do with the alarm. Who knows what could happen? A bunch of white dust goes
[07:36.190 --> 07:40.130]  everywhere. That's what happens. That's it. I don't know if there's a chemical, though,
[07:40.230 --> 07:45.750]  in the stuff that would activate the alarm. Who knows? I don't know. I don't know. Like,
[07:45.770 --> 07:50.570]  definitively, I think all I know is when you when you set off a fire extinguisher indoors,
[07:51.130 --> 07:55.690]  there are going to be unintended consequences and you need to protect yourself with an out.
[07:55.690 --> 08:01.090]  That's all I'm saying. Uh, I mean, I feel like that's not really I'm just explaining how it
[08:01.090 --> 08:06.470]  happened in that case. And I don't know if that's even a less dumb of a way. It's just I feel like
[08:06.470 --> 08:12.210]  just saying it was a bit on a podcast is more reasonable than the whole hot dog scenario that
[08:12.210 --> 08:18.270]  you're laying out, I guess. But then you're then you're basically saying I did this as a meme or
[08:18.270 --> 08:24.090]  a lull. And if there if there's any if there's any cost incurred, I would assume you would be.
[08:24.770 --> 08:28.570]  I don't feel like that changes with your story, though, in any way. I don't think there would be
[08:28.570 --> 08:32.930]  hot dog sympathy for I think there would be hot dog sympathy. I think there would be hot. I think
[08:32.930 --> 08:38.150]  any time, any time a house catches on fire from a wacky appliance or something, they're not that
[08:38.150 --> 08:42.210]  that's their sympathy for that. I don't want any mess, though. I don't like I don't want it. It
[08:42.210 --> 08:48.230]  has to be clean. It has to be a clean shot closet, probably. Probably is a key word. And also,
[08:48.230 --> 08:52.050]  like, if I fire it in the closet, I'm not going to pick it up on Mike. It has to be at my desk or
[08:52.050 --> 08:56.770]  I'd well, I guess I could. I don't think I could move my setup. My setup is very set.
[08:57.310 --> 09:03.470]  It's not a film on your phone. Yeah. Yeah. My phone. I'm going to film it on my phone.
[09:03.970 --> 09:09.410]  You remember that video I sent you, Gavin? I'm going to film it on my phone. It's a great idea.
[09:10.070 --> 09:15.850]  A fucking postage stamp of a video everyone will enjoy. I sent Gavin my phone's a piece of shit.
[09:15.850 --> 09:19.970]  And I sent Gavin a video off of it because something happened in a game like a glitch.
[09:19.970 --> 09:25.010]  And I don't know what happened, but it sent Gavin the photo. It was the size of a postage stamp. It
[09:25.010 --> 09:31.150]  was completely unviewable. It was like 60 pixels wide or something. It was insane. But I just put
[09:31.150 --> 09:36.350]  something in the mail, Andrew. You did. And maybe that problem won't be a thing anymore. That's a
[09:36.350 --> 09:39.990]  weird. You said that in a threatening way, even though I know it's a nice gesture.
[09:41.230 --> 09:45.270]  I immediately think of like jingle all the way with the bomb pack and like none of the
[09:45.270 --> 09:50.550]  someone says I sent you something in the mail. I don't know. There's a there's a tone to that.
[09:50.910 --> 09:55.430]  I sent you something nice. You know, I think I got to take umbrage with you too.
[09:55.970 --> 10:02.810]  You're criticizing me for telling Andrew to overcomplicate theatrically his fire extinguisher
[10:02.810 --> 10:08.170]  when Andrew's life mission is to overcomplicate things. I feel like I feel like you're pointing
[10:08.170 --> 10:12.250]  a lens at me that you never point inwardly at yourself or that Gavin points at you.
[10:12.250 --> 10:17.330]  I think that's a totally fair thing. I think a lot of the overcomplication comes, though,
[10:17.430 --> 10:22.730]  in the moment of anxiety and panic. It's not calculated. A lot of the time, I'd say that
[10:22.730 --> 10:28.010]  would be a very calculated point. Or like if the plan is calculated, it's to make less effort for
[10:28.010 --> 10:32.490]  myself and that what you're describing is more effort. Yeah, but less effort than going and
[10:32.490 --> 10:36.890]  collecting a bunch of Chinese food menus and then placing them around a neighborhood just
[10:36.890 --> 10:41.670]  so you can get close to a house to pick up a package. Yeah, that's less effort. Yeah. No,
[10:41.670 --> 10:48.290]  you're right. That's fair. You're right. Yeah. No, I was wrong. It falls in the category. I just
[10:48.290 --> 10:52.810]  don't think it's effective is the problem. I don't see how I'm helping myself with your thing
[10:52.810 --> 10:56.990]  in any way. That's totally fair. I was just trying to give you some sort of a dignified
[10:56.990 --> 11:02.030]  out. That's not like so you don't end up on the news. I appreciate local local podcaster. All
[11:02.030 --> 11:09.130]  you know, triggers fire since half of Vancouver Island for for Internet bit. You know that that's
[11:09.130 --> 11:14.170]  more of a story than like, what was there a fire trucks? Oh, yeah, there was like some sort of a
[11:14.170 --> 11:18.190]  problem with a with a with a toaster or something like, oh, OK, whatever. I think it would be
[11:18.190 --> 11:22.370]  Garfield Legend Falls. Considering the last time I was in the paper, I think it would be a follow
[11:22.370 --> 11:28.750]  up. Garfield Legend Falls, there you go. How many different reasons could you end up in the paper?
[11:29.030 --> 11:34.890]  Oh, I mean, it's limitless. I think it's not hard. I feel like the fire alarm one is super easy.
[11:34.890 --> 11:40.470]  That's one of the easiest ways to get the paper. Yeah. I mean, but I could go a lot, a lot lower.
[11:40.610 --> 11:45.010]  I think as long as you blast this thing in a room that doesn't have a smoke detector,
[11:45.210 --> 11:51.670]  like a bathroom, a room that's used to steam and particulates, cupcakes, just do it in there.
[11:52.250 --> 11:56.370]  It will give you a great excuse to clean. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not. I'm not firing
[11:56.370 --> 12:01.030]  it without a cover. Like, I need something to slip. I need some way to absorb the mess.
[12:01.030 --> 12:06.930]  You need a big tarp. I need a. Yeah, well, like I said to Geoff, my idea was to duct tape a bunch
[12:06.930 --> 12:11.110]  of trash bags to the nozzle. But then when I explained that to somebody, they said. Just fire
[12:11.110 --> 12:16.390]  it to a bag? Yeah, I was just going to fire it to a bunch of trash bags. They said either the bag
[12:16.390 --> 12:21.210]  would blow out at the end, like from the force of the pressure or where I taped would not hold
[12:21.210 --> 12:24.770]  and it would just shoot off and then go everywhere. Yeah, I think you need a very big bag because
[12:24.770 --> 12:30.990]  it's compressed into that, you know, metal container. How how about this? Do you have a
[12:30.990 --> 12:35.830]  neighbor that you hate? No. Oh, do you have a neighbor that you don't know very well that you'd
[12:35.830 --> 12:41.110]  like to get to know? All of them. OK, well, here's here's what you do if you want to mitigate mess
[12:41.110 --> 12:45.970]  on your end. Let's do this. Wait for a neighbor to go to work. Then you know they're not home
[12:45.970 --> 12:49.890]  and then we'll just take it into the hallway and we'll stick the nozzle under their door.
[12:50.190 --> 12:57.310]  We set it off that way and then you just go back to your room and we can maybe stick like a
[12:57.670 --> 13:00.710]  try to stick like a like a little pin camera under there so we can kind of see the mess.
[13:01.090 --> 13:05.210]  But anyway, and then just be out in the hallway later and be like when the guy or lady is getting
[13:05.210 --> 13:08.150]  off work and just be like, it's a crazy day. It was all kinds of noise and all kinds of weird
[13:08.150 --> 13:12.030]  stuff. They open up their door and they're like, oh, did it happen to you too? Weird happened to
[13:12.030 --> 13:16.930]  me. Let me help you clean it up. And then you can go in and you can videotape the mess and and then
[13:16.930 --> 13:24.110]  we'll get to see that. I like this idea more. The fire alarm went off today in my place. I think
[13:24.110 --> 13:27.890]  you're right. I just need to. But it wouldn't line up. What are the odds it lines up? I mean,
[13:27.890 --> 13:31.570]  we've been pretty lucky with things, so that'd be insanely lucky if it lines up with that episode.
[13:33.370 --> 13:37.010]  Well, I just run out of here in the middle of the recording to start firing a fire
[13:37.010 --> 13:42.850]  extinguisher everywhere just to like make sure everything's good. I was precautionary. Yeah,
[13:42.850 --> 13:52.230]  exactly. Oh, my God. Where's Nick today, by the way? He's late. He had to handle some sort of a
[13:52.230 --> 13:57.570]  work related emergency. Oh, is he going to be in this later? Yeah. Oh, he'll be here later.
[13:57.790 --> 14:03.770]  One of my notes for today's episode is to talk to Nick about something. I have a theory. I have
[14:03.770 --> 14:08.470]  a theory about Nick, but I'll wait until he's here. Maybe he's dodging you. Oh, maybe. Maybe
[14:08.470 --> 14:13.890]  he saw my notes. So I have one, two... I have a lot that we could talk about today, but we don't
[14:13.890 --> 14:17.730]  have to talk about any of it. Do you want to go through your stuff? Your Nick-less stuff, Gav?
[14:18.150 --> 14:21.850]  I feel like I should save the Nick stuff in case he does show up, but I have prepared... That's why
[14:21.850 --> 14:28.990]  I said Nick-less stuff. Yeah, I have... All right, chill out. I have prepared a small sound clip
[14:28.990 --> 14:32.970]  that I would like to play. Okay. Took an embarrassing amount of time to make this,
[14:33.190 --> 14:36.710]  going looking through old stuff. I'll just play it. It's about 40 seconds long. Are you ready?
[14:36.710 --> 14:43.590]  Yeah. Okay. When you were telling me on text, I'm pretty sure that you'd done this exact same thing
[14:43.590 --> 14:49.510]  last time you rolled your ankle. No, I didn't. No? No, this has never happened before. That's
[14:49.510 --> 14:55.930]  why it was eventful. I thought that last time you rolled your ankle, you were ODing on the
[14:56.470 --> 15:02.690]  painkillers and you had like an anal fissure of some sort. No, never happened. What's going on
[15:02.690 --> 15:06.390]  with your butt, dude? Geoff, didn't he say that he had an anal fissure because he was taking too much?
[15:06.390 --> 15:11.150]  No, no, no, no, no, no. I had an anal fissure recently. I haven't had a chill going on.
[15:12.010 --> 15:17.370]  Uh, what's up with the anal fissure? It was the prescription painkiller. I was saving my ankle
[15:17.370 --> 15:24.410]  to spite my butthole. Um, I don't know if you know anyone exactly like you, Andrew, but that's
[15:24.410 --> 15:32.330]  about how frustrating it is to interact with me on a weekly basis. Let me... Okay. I don't...
[15:32.890 --> 15:42.890]  Now I gotta look it up. I didn't realize... I apologize. Oh my god. Um, anal fissure... what is a...
[15:44.510 --> 15:48.830]  Now I gotta look into what... You do go on to say that you don't know if it is one because
[15:48.830 --> 15:52.150]  you didn't really look and it just felt like you were shitting rocks and you had like
[15:52.570 --> 15:57.670]  icy hot on your arsehole and that. But yeah, I'm honestly going... I'm really,
[15:58.370 --> 16:03.830]  weakly, really trying to listen to the things you're saying. I'm trying to take it in. I want
[16:03.830 --> 16:08.650]  to pull off this content for future episodes. I want to have a good sort of visualization of
[16:08.650 --> 16:13.470]  what we talk about so we can be on top of it. And you're making it very difficult for me,
[16:13.830 --> 16:19.270]  I'll be honest. That was my fault. There was no bleeding in the past. Um,
[16:20.270 --> 16:25.170]  I think what happened was I probably googled it right before we recorded and only read
[16:25.170 --> 16:29.150]  when you pass very hard or large stools during a bowel movement. I was like,
[16:29.210 --> 16:33.670]  that seems like it was what happened. I don't think I had a... Maybe I did. I mean,
[16:33.770 --> 16:38.210]  I'm not a butt doctor. I can't diagnose myself. I just know there was no blood in the past.
[16:38.350 --> 16:42.610]  It's less important what you actually had, but more importantly what the things that you say
[16:42.610 --> 16:48.190]  seem to count for nothing. Nah, I just, I didn't... I forget what happens in this podcast.
[16:49.530 --> 16:54.150]  You think I'm going to remember how I phrased a butt injury from what? How far ago?
[16:54.150 --> 16:57.150]  Phrase it identically. That's how you phrased it. Yeah. And also,
[16:57.250 --> 17:06.050]  why do I remember how you phrased it? I don't know, Gavin. I had to go back. I had to look
[17:06.050 --> 17:09.750]  through. I, you have no idea how long ago that was. I thought it was much more recent.
[17:10.070 --> 17:14.790]  That episode was from November. Yeah. That was a long time ago.
[17:17.490 --> 17:22.070]  I did not expect... That was quite the twist, Gavin. I thought it was going to be Waffle Bomb
[17:22.070 --> 17:27.170]  related because you asked me about that episode somewhat recently. I did not know. I apologize.
[17:27.690 --> 17:32.450]  I didn't remember using that terminology. I accept your apology. It was worth it for doing
[17:32.450 --> 17:38.990]  that, I think. That was, Gavin, that was brilliant. That was the best thing you've ever done for this
[17:38.990 --> 17:43.210]  podcast. Maybe also the only thing you've ever done. One of the only things you've ever done
[17:43.210 --> 17:51.490]  for this podcast. Makes me feel shitty about this. I'll be taking offense to that.
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.720]  It's like I'm living in my... I'm never... Fuck it. I'm not... Never mind. Go on. Continue.
[18:01.640 --> 18:05.540]  Go ahead. Geoff, Geoff, should we... I mean, this is like both of our bit.
[18:05.800 --> 18:10.440]  Should we talk about our bike ride? Okay. Yeah. Here's what we got. I have the...
[18:14.980 --> 18:21.960]  Yeah, let's do the bike ride. You want to start? No, you take it away. I'm sorry. I'm laughing
[18:21.960 --> 18:27.980]  at stuff. Sunday now, Gavin and I... Gavin and I have been trying to go for a bike ride together
[18:27.980 --> 18:34.360]  for over a month. And one of us keeps canceling it for work or whatever. Or the weather. The
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.820]  weather fucking shit on our mouths twice last week, I think we were trying to do it. I was
[18:39.820 --> 18:43.560]  like texting Gavin and he's like, this isn't happening. I'm like, yeah, I know. And so Sunday,
[18:43.620 --> 18:49.040]  we finally got to go on a lovely little bike ride together. And first off, I have discovered a new
[18:49.040 --> 18:56.300]  joy in life. And that joy is leisurely riding to the top of a hill to sit and turn around and
[18:56.300 --> 19:03.840]  wait and watch while Gavin struggles mightily for hours to make it up that hill. Goddamn, dude. His
[19:03.840 --> 19:13.220]  bike is even more bullshit than it seems to look at. He can ride no handed, leaning back like he's
[19:13.220 --> 19:19.260]  straight up a hill. And I'm just switched down to like gear one. And he's looking back at me,
[19:19.300 --> 19:24.860]  my bike swaying back and forth. You know, when people are like swinging all over the place
[19:24.860 --> 19:29.440]  to make it up like 200 feet of hill that he decided we should immediately start with.
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.980]  And he's just cruising up. And then he's talking to me while he's doing this.
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.900]  He's telling me stories. Suddenly I'm like 50 meters behind him. I'm like,
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.700]  Geoff, come on. And I can't hear most of the story. And I'm having to pedal really hard to hear what
[19:44.700 --> 19:52.440]  he's on about. He's not wrong. We immediately went up this giant hill and then I got to the top of
[19:52.440 --> 19:57.440]  it and I fucking I thoroughly enjoyed watching Gavin get up there. And then I thought it's going
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.300]  to be a lot more hilly this way. Let's just turn around and go back down and go the other way.
[20:01.300 --> 20:05.360]  And so we just immediately turned around. It was for no reason. And my bike,
[20:06.420 --> 20:10.620]  because it's been, whenever we last went on a bike ride and we talked about how the brakes
[20:10.620 --> 20:15.020]  are switched and I almost died. That was the last time I rode this bike. So now both the tires are
[20:15.020 --> 20:20.200]  flat. The air just, I guess there's a hole in one of them. We pumped it up immediately after about
[20:20.200 --> 20:25.360]  two minutes. They were like flaccid. And every time I went over a hump, I could feel it bottoming out
[20:25.360 --> 20:33.280]  against the metal. You never mentioned that. So I'm riding up hills with basically two flat
[20:33.280 --> 20:40.760]  tires while a lazy boy up here is just cruising up them. Andrew, when he says lazy boy, he means
[20:40.760 --> 20:47.660]  it really. I realized the disparity in our gear really quickly. And so in an effort to be as
[20:47.660 --> 20:54.000]  insulting to Gavin as possible and as smug and as dickheadish as possible, I went up the whole
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.960]  hill without using my hands. And instead I interlocked them behind my head and leaned back
[20:58.960 --> 21:05.740]  on the bike as if I was taking a nap in a chair. Then I get scared by this. We were on the road,
[21:05.840 --> 21:10.000]  so there was a car coming up behind us. The first car that got up behind us, I was sort of
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.520]  a little bit scared. It was clearly impatient. I thought I'll get out of the way. Geoff just
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.700]  leisurely cruises out into the road, slowing this car down. And I panicked and I just turned
[21:19.700 --> 21:23.780]  off the wrong way, which Geoff found really funny that we ended up in different directions down the
[21:23.780 --> 21:29.440]  street. Then later on it happened again. It's in like a one lane. Geoff's like we're running through
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.900]  the middle of the road and clearly like some cars are piling up behind us. So my thought is let me
[21:33.900 --> 21:38.480]  get to the side. Geoff doesn't think this at all. He's like, I'll stay in the middle. But then I was
[21:38.480 --> 21:43.960]  so panicked by this car. I put so much pressure on me that the bottom of my pedal twatted the curb
[21:43.960 --> 21:49.220]  and it bounced my bike up. Geoff starts shitting himself with laughter again.
[21:50.840 --> 21:58.380]  You wrecked, you loser! I came off. I had to pull off to the side. I was laughing too. I couldn't see.
[21:59.040 --> 22:04.240]  We're both just like laughing all over each other. Geoff makes fun of me for ages about this. And then
[22:04.800 --> 22:12.680]  no less than what, eight minutes later, Geoff crashes for no reason into a wall. His handlebars
[22:13.560 --> 22:19.200]  hit the wall in front of a load of people, by the way. And I'm talking to him, not looking at
[22:19.200 --> 22:23.980]  him. I'm just to his side. He's telling a story. All I hear all of a sudden is...
[22:25.100 --> 22:30.600]  I look over. Geoff has hit the wall and I guess he like stops the front of his bike dead. I look
[22:30.600 --> 22:37.560]  over. His ass is about two feet above the saddle and he's still holding on. It was the most bizarre
[22:37.560 --> 22:43.440]  freeze frame. And I think a much more embarrassing wreck than the one I did. It almost pitched me
[22:43.440 --> 22:49.320]  full over the front of the bike somehow. You turned right as I caught myself. And it was more
[22:49.320 --> 22:53.620]  embarrassing, if only because you were right. There were probably 25 people in front of us.
[22:53.820 --> 22:59.240]  There was a girl looking and laughing and I just started. I felt like that was the perfect time to
[22:59.240 --> 23:04.240]  point and laugh at you as well. Oh yeah, you certainly did. Here's the deal, Andrew. You said,
[23:04.340 --> 23:09.780]  how did I hit a wall? We were on a bridge going over Lake Austin or Travis, whatever it is,
[23:09.780 --> 23:16.180]  fucking water. And that bridge has a, you know, it's fucking death on the left side over the
[23:16.180 --> 23:19.800]  railing. And then on the right, there's just a wall that goes up to the, like a highway or
[23:19.800 --> 23:25.960]  something. And I just, that was, I was trying to weave between people and I just, I just weaved a
[23:25.960 --> 23:30.740]  little too hard to the right. And I, my, the handlebar caught an edge and then it just pulled
[23:30.740 --> 23:35.120]  the whole bike into the wall. Then I flipped over it and got it. We're two grown men though. We're
[23:35.120 --> 23:38.580]  crashing like we're six year olds who just learned to ride. I don't know what's wrong with us.
[23:38.580 --> 23:45.620]  It might be the hardest I've laughed in two or three months. It was, I felt like,
[23:46.740 --> 23:53.300]  I felt like I was, I had so much fun. I felt like I was 10 years old again. I went to bed going,
[23:53.460 --> 23:58.600]  I want to get tomorrow and ride my bikes with my friend again. Of course we didn't, but it was like,
[23:59.020 --> 24:03.860]  it was the most fun. I can't tell you how much fun it was. We must have laughed for three straight
[24:03.860 --> 24:09.080]  hours. It was good. Yeah. But do you, you gotta be honest. Do you crash most times that you ride?
[24:09.200 --> 24:13.420]  Because there's no way. Once again, I feel like I'm always around you when this stuff's happening.
[24:13.580 --> 24:18.880]  It can't be anything to do with me. It must be a basically a daily basis that this happens.
[24:19.320 --> 24:26.920]  I crashed today, but not bad, but yeah, I did crash today. Oh wait, what, what does that mean?
[24:27.220 --> 24:32.640]  I just, my tire like caught a edge wrong when I was going over like a, like a concrete area.
[24:32.640 --> 24:36.500]  And uh, yeah, and I fell off the bike for a second, but it wasn't bad. I wasn't going fast
[24:36.500 --> 24:40.420]  and it wasn't bad. It just got like jammed up. But yeah, I would say probably every time I ride,
[24:40.680 --> 24:47.780]  which is every day. I was telling Gavin in that moment though, Andrew. So I realized I've
[24:47.780 --> 24:54.100]  unintentionally made the repairman and the bug person think that I'm a porn director, I think.
[24:55.240 --> 25:02.120]  Cause, uh, well, uh, Emily and I went to Marfa and out to West Texas for like a little time away
[25:02.120 --> 25:06.480]  recently. And we like rented a little house out in the desert, you know, and in that house,
[25:06.540 --> 25:13.560]  it had this really cool, uh, little like portable projector. And we got kind of jazzed about it
[25:13.560 --> 25:16.920]  cause you just kind of move it around the house and it was really easy to use all Bluetooth and
[25:16.920 --> 25:20.720]  stuff. And so when we came home, I started looking at them and I found one that looks just
[25:20.720 --> 25:24.800]  like a little Bluetooth speaker and it's got like a five hour battery. And so I bought one.
[25:25.240 --> 25:30.420]  And uh, cause it was pretty cheap and we just stuck it in the bedroom on a tripod and pointed
[25:30.420 --> 25:35.760]  at the ceiling, uh, just for the hell of it and instantly became hooked on watching ceiling TV.
[25:36.380 --> 25:42.340]  But it, now I have a giant tripod with a big glowing black thing with a green dot pointing
[25:42.340 --> 25:47.100]  right at my bed and we just walk around that we don't ever think about it. But then I caught,
[25:47.200 --> 25:52.560]  we had the bug guy come over the other day and I saw him, uh, I just saw him looking at it for a
[25:52.560 --> 25:57.180]  while and I thought, oh fuck, he thinks we film ourselves or something. And I, and I didn't know
[25:57.180 --> 26:01.820]  how to explain to him cause we hadn't had any kind of dialogue yet. I didn't know how to explain
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.520]  to him. Yeah, that's a, that's a projector. That's not, that's not a camera. You know,
[26:05.880 --> 26:10.880]  that's where I project my porn. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so, and then later in the day I was
[26:10.880 --> 26:14.460]  having the, and I don't know that I want to get into it today, but you know, I was having a
[26:14.460 --> 26:19.500]  foundation repair man come out and look at my house and then he was like, uh, he was like, uh,
[26:19.880 --> 26:24.600]  you got interesting, uh, stuff going on in here. And I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh. And then I explained
[26:24.600 --> 26:30.780]  it to him. He brought it up. Uh, but uh, anyway, and then on top of that, on it, I watch my breaks,
[26:30.860 --> 26:34.120]  right? I watch my baseball card, basketball breaks, that kind of stuff. And I do that on YouTube,
[26:34.460 --> 26:38.500]  but I can't be bothered. I don't actually have a YouTube account. Like I've always just used
[26:38.500 --> 26:43.300]  like different roosterteeth accounts cause for work and stuff. So it like every time it loads
[26:43.300 --> 26:48.460]  YouTube on my ceiling, it tries to get me to log in. And so I have to hit skip, but that fucking
[26:48.460 --> 26:52.640]  login screen every time give you, I give you a hundred dollars. If you can guess what it is,
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.440]  Andrew. Oh, there's no way I'm going to guess. I'll tell you what it is. It's a giant Gavin free.
[26:57.880 --> 27:03.580]  So it's like a slow-mo guys still. So on my ceiling every night when I want to watch TV,
[27:03.580 --> 27:07.860]  the first thing I have to do is like, look at Gavin's face. Like it's fucking Queen's Gambit.
[27:08.100 --> 27:12.400]  I'm like, I'm learning Gavin chess moves every night of my life. He's one of the last things I
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.140]  see before I fall asleep. No, I should have guessed that because I have the annoying thing. That's,
[27:16.140 --> 27:20.660]  that's my cable box app does the same. Every time I log into my fucking YouTube app through
[27:20.660 --> 27:26.100]  the cable box, I have to see Gavin's dumb face because I'm like framed perfectly on the left,
[27:26.260 --> 27:32.540]  but then all of the sign in text is covering up Dan. Well, I do appreciate crystal clear waters,
[27:33.260 --> 27:39.420]  white, sandy beaches, tropical drinks with little umbrellas stress doesn't exist here,
[27:39.500 --> 27:44.740]  but it could back at home where an undetected water leak can turn into costly water damage.
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.780]  But with Moen Flow, you can enjoy your vacation with no worries. It detects leaks and stops your
[27:51.780 --> 27:58.760]  water main automatically from anywhere. So the only thing on your mind is having nothing on your mind.
[27:59.360 --> 27:59.720]  Moen.

[28:30.740 --> 28:36.780]  Buenos dias! Café Bustelo Espresso styled iced coffee is hitting refrigerators with a cold front
[28:36.780 --> 28:42.020]  that'll sweep through your senses. So keep the coffee pours long and the cold sips low.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.420]  That part. If I had to look at Gavin and Dan, that'd be a rough day. But I can stomach look at
[28:50.420 --> 28:53.080]  one of you, but every night I'm laying up and I'm just thinking about like, I'm just thinking about
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.540]  that little girl in the fucking episode one of the Queen's Gambit moving chess pieces around.
[28:58.520 --> 29:00.640]  But I'm doing it with a British idiot. Yeah.
[29:06.930 --> 29:14.910]  Why not get the perfect Mother's Day gift for the woman in your life who wiped your butt first?
[29:15.470 --> 29:19.830]  Years before you even considered it. Not only did she do it, she did it with love,
[29:19.910 --> 29:24.650]  and then most likely she taught you how to do it. For a woman who's done so much for you,
[29:24.810 --> 29:30.250]  why don't you bring her into the future with the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 modern bidet attachment?
[29:30.250 --> 29:36.050]  Oh my God, it's stylish. It's eco-friendly. Moms love eco-friendly stuff. It's easy to install.
[29:36.390 --> 29:40.790]  Moms love easy to install stuff. They hate hard to install stuff. It's on the list. It's one of
[29:40.790 --> 29:46.470]  the things that moms hate most in the world. It also helps stop flushing her retirement down the
[29:46.470 --> 29:52.290]  toilet in toilet paper costs. Once you're on a fixed income, those hiking, rising toilet paper
[29:52.290 --> 29:57.030]  costs, they will really eat into all of those retirement benefits. It's brutal. But the Hello
[29:57.030 --> 30:03.410]  Tushy 3.0 cleans butts like a champ. And it cuts down on those toilet paper costs by eliminating
[30:03.410 --> 30:09.310]  up to 80% of the need for toilet paper. It also cleans itself. Mom cleaned up after you,
[30:09.430 --> 30:13.470]  not just your butt. She cleaned up your lunch and your mess and your clothes and your socks and
[30:13.470 --> 30:19.770]  your sleepover parties and your breakfast every all the stuff that mom did for you. She cleaned
[30:19.770 --> 30:24.890]  for you. You can clean for her too. It cleans itself with the smart spray. It's an automatic
[30:24.890 --> 30:28.530]  self-cleaning nozzle. Just think about that for a second. Have you thought about it? Okay,
[30:28.650 --> 30:33.370]  that's good. Plus, every Hello Tushy bidet attachment comes with a 60-day risk-free
[30:33.370 --> 30:38.370]  guarantee and a 12-month warranty. Has mom already got a Tushy? Well, that's okay. You
[30:38.370 --> 30:43.430]  can upgrade hers to the 3.0 or get one for a second toilet. Your mom probably has two dumpers.

[31:00.350 --> 31:05.690]  show's new sponsor, BetterHelp Online Therapy. A lot of us take care of our bodies, but 2020
[31:05.690 --> 31:12.870]  and 2021 have been tough. Very, very obviously tough. So we might want to take care of our
[31:12.870 --> 31:17.270]  minds too. There's a misunderstanding of what therapy is. It can be whatever you want it to be.
[31:17.490 --> 31:23.070]  It doesn't have to be sitting around and talking about feelings or your childhood or anything like
[31:23.070 --> 31:28.430]  that. I talk about my career a lot. I talk about work decisions. I have my therapist help me work
[31:28.430 --> 31:34.130]  out, you know, which direction do I want to go, which is a better option for me, that kind of
[31:34.130 --> 31:39.370]  stuff. And it's been invaluable in my life. A lot of people battle with their temper or their
[31:39.370 --> 31:44.970]  stress is about to kill them, or they have depression, anxiety, PTSD, the list goes on.
[31:45.030 --> 31:50.130]  And if this is you, you can use therapy to get some tools to make life easier. I certainly have.
[31:50.130 --> 31:54.650]  When everyone is struggling with something, there's no more shame. You don't have to tell
[31:54.650 --> 31:58.190]  everyone your personal business, but you can talk to a therapist about it privately.
[31:58.810 --> 32:03.730]  BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions
[32:03.730 --> 32:07.850]  with your therapist. So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to. It's much
[32:07.850 --> 32:11.570]  more affordable than in-person therapy, and you can start communicating with your therapist in

[32:34.590 --> 32:40.530]  You just dropped, I feel like, a horrifying image, Geoff, into our Discord without context.
[32:40.690 --> 32:43.670]  Oh, yeah. I got distracted by that. What is that? Yeah, I'm looking in the chat.
[32:43.670 --> 32:46.550]  I dropped it in so we could talk about it in a minute, but we can get into it.
[32:47.070 --> 32:49.690]  This is something that came through the Instagram, I believe,
[32:50.270 --> 32:56.330]  that someone from a comment leaver alerted us to. That is a Don Zimmer teddy bear
[32:57.290 --> 33:03.270]  that was created as a promotional item by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and given away at baseball games.
[33:03.430 --> 33:07.510]  Oh, it's just horrific. Somehow he looks sweaty.
[33:12.250 --> 33:17.590]  He does. He does have a gleam to him. Yeah, a bit of an oily sheen.
[33:17.610 --> 33:22.210]  It's like something designed to be cuddled that looks like it doesn't want to be cuddled at all.
[33:22.290 --> 33:23.750]  Absolutely. A very serious expression.
[33:24.290 --> 33:28.270]  Only wants to talk about baseball. I'm just imagining that now in that
[33:28.730 --> 33:34.010]  scene in E.T. where it just runs slowly across the screen. What would be the last
[33:34.010 --> 33:38.310]  thing to be picked up by a kid? I hope somebody makes that image.
[33:40.090 --> 33:42.110]  We'll put it on the Instagram if you make it, please.
[33:42.570 --> 33:49.050]  Oh, my God. So I bought three of them, one for each of us immediately. The second I found it.
[33:49.210 --> 33:54.570]  So I'll let you guys know when they come in. Awesome. It's funny. As soon as I got the text
[33:54.570 --> 33:58.530]  about it, I went to buy that. I went to two different listings and they were sold immediately.
[33:58.690 --> 34:03.990]  Those were the two I bought. Yeah, but that that's while we're talking Zimmer.
[34:04.310 --> 34:07.210]  Gavin, did you see the thing that that hit Twitter today?
[34:07.770 --> 34:12.810]  Trevor showed it to me about the predictive off topic from like a year ago.
[34:13.210 --> 34:13.330]  No.
[34:13.750 --> 34:17.570]  All right. Andrew hasn't read it, hasn't heard it either. I've listened to it. I think it's
[34:17.570 --> 34:21.370]  insane. I'm gonna try to play it to you guys through my microphone. If it doesn't work or
[34:21.370 --> 34:25.550]  if it sounds like shit, I'm sure Nick can superimpose for the episode. But you guys can
[34:25.550 --> 34:30.730]  just listen to it on your own. I'll send you the link. But this is from an off topic over a year
[34:30.730 --> 34:36.870]  ago. Off topic number 229. That's a podcast that we do. Some of us do at the company that predates
[34:36.870 --> 34:39.710]  this one. It's called Red Dot Dooley. Listen to this.
[34:40.270 --> 34:45.970]  That's the shirt that's going to crop up when we're like 10 years from now on a Reddit post
[34:45.970 --> 34:52.350]  or a Twitter post or whatever. Zimzam social media comes out 10 years from now. Yeah, I'm
[34:52.350 --> 34:56.910]  going to zam a shirt up there. That's what you do in the future. We're going to see photos of
[34:56.910 --> 35:01.070]  people being like, oh, I just picked up this shirt at, you know, Goodwill and it says front
[35:01.070 --> 35:05.690]  on the back. You guys know what is this? I just I can't wait for that moment when it's like
[35:05.690 --> 35:10.510]  completely irrelevant and no one has any grounding for anything for it. Trevor Collins
[35:11.050 --> 35:16.410]  over a year ago unintentionally predicted predicting the Zimmer shirt.
[35:18.110 --> 35:22.550]  He was in the Zimmer zone before any of us. He fucking created the Zimmer zone.
[35:22.670 --> 35:30.830]  We're swimming in his wake. The Zimzam whatever. Am I on that podcast? Uh, I don't know.
[35:31.350 --> 35:34.570]  I wonder if he's subconsciously influenced me if I'm on it.
[35:34.570 --> 35:40.530]  If I'm not on it, I've probably not heard it. I don't know. Let's see. It just says
[35:40.530 --> 35:45.850]  Michael was on it. Trevor was on it. Matt Bragg was on it. I assume Dually was on it.
[35:46.150 --> 35:51.510]  I don't see you on there, Gav. Alfredo. Yeah. How fucking nutso is that, though?
[35:51.750 --> 35:56.070]  That is bonkers. We've had some pretty ridiculous coincidences on this podcast.
[35:56.410 --> 36:01.270]  We have. That's like that. Well, I think we can obviously we should talk about the coincidence
[36:01.270 --> 36:05.290]  of the port-a-potty phone call because some people in the audience, some comment leavers
[36:05.290 --> 36:09.110]  seem to have trouble believing that that was legit. But also like similarly, I was telling
[36:09.110 --> 36:15.990]  Andrew earlier that story, Gav, about how you and I were filming a Minecraft series for the company
[36:15.990 --> 36:20.410]  where the point of the series is when you die, you're dead. It's called you're dead. You're
[36:20.410 --> 36:24.150]  dead. So you only get one life. And the goal is to be the last person alive. And it can take
[36:24.150 --> 36:29.550]  hours and hours across weeks. Right. And in it, you were chopping down a tree,
[36:29.550 --> 36:34.270]  which there's a new mechanic in Minecraft. When you chop a tree down, you actually fell the tree
[36:34.270 --> 36:37.910]  like in the old days, it would just pop and all the gubbins. I think it might be a mod that we're
[36:37.910 --> 36:42.030]  using. Oh, OK. Maybe it's a mod. But now it's like timber and it falls and it does like what a tree
[36:42.030 --> 36:45.630]  does. It like kicks back a little bit and you stand back. Kind of reminds me of that game,
[36:45.710 --> 36:52.830]  the forest we used to play, actually, the way it falls. But in that episode, we Gavin was telling
[36:52.830 --> 36:59.210]  the story about how or we were discussing the story that you told on Face about how you thought
[36:59.210 --> 37:05.570]  threw a branch out of a second story window to hit you in the forehead. And now you don't sunbathe
[37:05.570 --> 37:10.630]  anymore. And while while we're telling that story and people are like, why would you think Geoff
[37:10.630 --> 37:16.070]  would hit you in the head like with a tree of all things? Gavin cuts a tree down, chops a tree down,
[37:16.170 --> 37:20.290]  and it kicks back in a way that it doesn't normally. And it fucking kills him. And so
[37:20.290 --> 37:23.870]  we're like, I'm like telling the story and then it pops up and it because Minecraft has death
[37:23.870 --> 37:29.190]  messages and it just says Gavin free was killed by a tree. It was so shocking that I didn't even
[37:29.190 --> 37:35.530]  really make a death noise. You can just hear me go like a little gasp of like, oh, it was the
[37:35.530 --> 37:42.230]  craziest coincidence and timing. And I it was so weird. And I feel like that happens so perfectly
[37:42.230 --> 37:47.570]  and so often for us at Face. It's it's almost like as if the universe has ordained the show.
[37:47.930 --> 37:53.330]  Yes. Like everything is circling face somehow. We don't even know it. It was hard to convince
[37:53.330 --> 37:57.530]  people that I didn't do it on purpose. Yeah. And I mean, the way I play games of videos,
[37:58.030 --> 38:02.330]  very careless. I try and be as careless as possible, but I don't ever do anything
[38:02.330 --> 38:07.930]  like that on purpose. I mean, I play in a dangerous way for sure. But I don't that was
[38:07.930 --> 38:13.710]  so unbelievably perfectly real. And I can't believe it happened. Absolutely. It is an insane
[38:13.710 --> 38:18.590]  moment. There's another one like even before the port-a-potty call, which was crazy. I mean, like
[38:18.590 --> 38:24.090]  the the layers of which us being able to capture that. I didn't even I didn't even think about it.
[38:24.090 --> 38:28.450]  But yeah, like we had to move the recording for I don't even know why we moved it, but we moved it.
[38:28.510 --> 38:33.270]  We typically record on Thursday. We recorded it on a Friday that week, which is rare. And then we
[38:33.270 --> 38:39.190]  had to do two because Geoff was out the next week. So unless like we did two episodes and we moved
[38:39.190 --> 38:43.970]  the day, it's the only reason like if we only did one episode that day, we still would have missed
[38:43.970 --> 38:48.850]  it. It was like 30 minutes into the next episode. It was just an insane coincidence. And honestly,
[38:48.930 --> 38:53.710]  ideal for me because I hate talking to people on the phone, like especially numbers I don't
[38:53.710 --> 39:00.550]  recognize. So but it became like the oh, this is so clearly insanely perfect show content overrid
[39:00.550 --> 39:06.550]  any personal anxiety I have. So it was ideal for dealing with this. But you're very good
[39:06.550 --> 39:09.690]  on the phone. You're very polite. I feel like people like talking to you on the phone. Why
[39:09.690 --> 39:15.290]  don't you? Oh, but internally terrified the entire time. I just yeah, yeah, it might sound
[39:15.290 --> 39:22.850]  good on the surface inside panic factory happening, but it overruled the moment overruled the anxiety
[39:22.850 --> 39:28.730]  for me. I'll go further and say to that if that hadn't happened in that moment, I would I only
[39:28.730 --> 39:33.670]  picked up the phone for content. I would have continued to I guarantee you there was not I
[39:33.670 --> 39:37.450]  still would not have seen that porta potty at this point. If that hadn't happened on camera,
[39:37.890 --> 39:41.250]  then you couldn't have forced me to pick up the phone. And I would have continued to dodge that
[39:41.250 --> 39:46.150]  or get creative or come up with some other bit. But I did not intend for the porta potty to make
[39:46.150 --> 39:51.150]  its way to my house. That picture of you inside it, by the way, phenomenal. Oh, amazing. Yeah,
[39:51.150 --> 39:56.630]  we'll put that up, I guess, whenever next week, right? Next week. Yeah, last week or next week,
[39:56.630 --> 40:02.630]  whenever we film the stuff. But yeah, I mean, I intended to do stuff with the bit and to continue
[40:02.630 --> 40:09.650]  to go, but I didn't want it at my house. And and then it turned out to be a blessing in disguise
[40:09.650 --> 40:13.650]  because we ended up having so much fun and came up with so many ideas for the for the porta potty.
[40:13.690 --> 40:20.790]  And I was able to have it in my front yard next to a mega walking and bike riding path where tons
[40:20.790 --> 40:29.310]  of people commute and get exercise. And for eight fucking days or something, nobody used the porta
[40:29.310 --> 40:35.830]  potty. I was I was terrified. And every morning I would get up and check was so scared, so scared
[40:35.830 --> 40:40.190]  because the second that thing the second some stranger Peter pooped in it, it was dead.
[40:41.090 --> 40:46.550]  It was no there's no recovering from that. There's no amount of cleaning that fixes that
[40:46.550 --> 40:51.950]  porta potty so that we can then use it for future face endeavors. It was going right in the trash.
[40:52.070 --> 40:57.590]  You can't un-shit a porta potty. You cannot un-shit a porta potty. That is you should put on a shirt, Gavin.
[41:01.930 --> 41:06.370]  So is it at the office now? Did it get picked up? Yeah, yeah, they picked it up. I think it got
[41:06.370 --> 41:10.930]  picked up yesterday. And I'd like to point out not a single neighbor, not that I know any of my
[41:10.930 --> 41:15.470]  neighbors, not a single one of them came over and said, hey, what's with the big ugly pink shitter
[41:15.470 --> 41:20.550]  in your front yard? Well, it's because it was beautiful. If it was HOA, they'd be like you got
[41:20.550 --> 41:26.110]  to paint that a different color. Yeah, exactly. That porta potty is one inch too tall.
[41:28.310 --> 41:34.610]  Oh, another like sort of random, not nearly as exciting as the porta potty call. When I was
[41:34.610 --> 41:39.190]  doing one of those bullshit puzzle things, like when I made that server and I was just kind of
[41:39.190 --> 41:45.370]  making it up as I go, like the riddle thing, I had a clue and it was related to the old NBA
[41:45.370 --> 41:49.250]  commissioner or something. I don't remember what it was. It was so long ago. I don't remember the
[41:49.250 --> 41:54.650]  specifics of it. David Stern? Yeah, I had like a David Stern thing. And then it just, I didn't
[41:54.650 --> 41:59.830]  know this. David Stern has two kids and their names are Andrew and Eric. And it just, I had
[41:59.830 --> 42:02.750]  no idea. And so then people, that's how they interpreted the clue. And they went on this
[42:02.750 --> 42:06.470]  whole thing about David Stern's kids. I just didn't know. This is a random coincidence.
[42:06.470 --> 42:11.330]  It's just like the amount of things that just happened to connect accidentally with the show
[42:11.330 --> 42:16.650]  are phenomenal. That's how I remember that. That was insane. Other Don Zimmer products we kind
[42:16.650 --> 42:20.570]  of went over. I just wanted to share these as well. I feel like Tampa really took advantage
[42:20.570 --> 42:25.470]  of the Zimmer zone more than any other team did. Yeah, they knew what they had. Product not as
[42:25.470 --> 42:32.190]  great, but the box, I just think it's fantastic. Look at that smile. Look at Zimmer's grin. I don't
[42:32.190 --> 42:37.270]  know if he has eyes, but he looks thrilled to be a Snuggle. It's weird. The only thing I can think
[42:37.270 --> 42:44.010]  to describe that is that his face is so much bigger than his face. Yeah, yeah. Like there's
[42:44.010 --> 42:53.050]  too much face for his eye holes. Yeah. The product not great doesn't really look like him, but that
[42:53.050 --> 43:01.610]  box, what a fantastic box. The product actually looks like Bob Hope a little bit. And they also
[43:01.610 --> 43:07.290]  made fans, which is great. Somebody selling an autographed fan, which is just a fantastic box.
[43:07.970 --> 43:16.650]  It's like 20% throat. I bet it's cooling abilities are much higher than anyone else's.
[43:20.850 --> 43:24.750]  The second this podcast is over, I'm on eBay buying those. Oh my God.
[43:24.750 --> 43:34.170]  Uh, man, speaking of Jesus, is there more? No, I mean, I have one more. It's not quite as good.
[43:34.190 --> 43:40.350]  I could share it. They did. It's more just like he looks like a fucking hot dog in. Maybe I didn't
[43:40.350 --> 43:45.410]  even save that. Give me a second. I got to go pull the image. They made bobbleheads. They made this
[43:45.410 --> 43:50.590]  Zimmer. I think it was checkers. It wasn't even the team. Checkers made a bobblehead of Zimmer,
[43:51.110 --> 43:56.530]  and he just looks hot dog, like kind of orangey red. What color would you say a hot dog is?
[43:56.910 --> 44:02.790]  Red. Brown. Brown. You'd say brown. I don't know what I'd necessarily like, but it's hot,
[44:02.950 --> 44:07.910]  like a hot dog. I would say nature's orange. It's a hot dog Zim for you. Nature's orange is
[44:07.910 --> 44:14.010]  literally an orange, Geoff. That's true. Not nature's fruit orange, nature's color orange.
[44:14.130 --> 44:19.230]  Well, yeah. What? It's like, it's like, it's like the orange is the meat we'll get. Maybe.
[44:19.610 --> 44:24.950]  I think oranges are way more complicated than we realized. That's something I've learned from this
[44:24.950 --> 44:29.510]  podcast. I would, what was your, the Mandarin, not calling a Mandarin an orange, Gavin? Oh,
[44:29.570 --> 44:35.190]  yeah. Yeah, that was that whole orange related discussion. Eric, what color is, what color is
[44:35.190 --> 44:39.370]  a hot dog? You're asking me what, are you asking me what color a hot dog is? Yeah,
[44:39.450 --> 44:42.010]  let me get it outside of it. Were you not listening, Eric? Aren't you supposed to be
[44:42.010 --> 44:49.170]  listening? I am listening. I'm, I was taken back because I don't, or there's a lot to oranges
[44:49.170 --> 44:54.570]  Yeah, I think there's, oh, is orange a clementine, an orange? Yeah. What color is a hot dog? Uh,
[44:54.690 --> 44:58.830]  we were just talking about the color of a hot dog. That's how we got to oranges. That's right.
[44:58.970 --> 45:04.290]  But then circling back really fucking got me. That was, uh, bizarre. What's the color of a
[45:04.290 --> 45:09.210]  cooked hot dog? Uh, I would give it a pink color. Do you not think it's a pink hue? Maybe pink.
[45:09.550 --> 45:14.970]  After cooked, I would say less pink. I would say it's like a brownish. Like a brownish? When I put
[45:14.970 --> 45:20.510]  ketchup on a hot dog, it's red on brown, kind of. But here, here's the thing. Like when I think
[45:20.510 --> 45:25.570]  of a hot dog, I don't think of one that I'm holding in my hands with like grill marks on it. I think
[45:25.570 --> 45:33.370]  of what a hot dog in a commercial looks like. And to me, it's like that really pink hue that it never
[45:33.370 --> 45:37.970]  really is when you eat it. Like that in my head is what color a hot dog is. You know what I mean?
[45:38.290 --> 45:44.810]  I think that settles it. Case closed. There you have it. See you later. Thanks, Eric. I mean,
[45:44.810 --> 45:53.910]  brown is just dark orange, really. Are we going down another Gerpel route? Oh, man. We already
[45:53.910 --> 46:01.730]  did the color thing. Oh, yeah. Even though Andrew never said it. So, oh, I did say Gerpel. That's
[46:01.730 --> 46:06.210]  no. We will go back to the tapes on that. You said I didn't, and then we reviewed it. Yeah,
[46:06.230 --> 46:12.110]  you said it. You said it. In the process of like buying this dumb Zimmer shit, Andrew and I have
[46:12.670 --> 46:16.830]  we've all been working on kind of in the background, an idea for sort of like a live
[46:16.830 --> 46:21.810]  streamed event things kind of around like dumb baseball cards and collectibles and stuff and
[46:22.430 --> 46:26.290]  open it up and kind of like having fun with them, whatever. And so Andrew and I've been looking at
[46:26.290 --> 46:33.970]  doing some research and on like weird, funny stuff to collect. And I discovered that there are
[46:33.970 --> 46:39.970]  apparently it's very popular. Game of Thrones trading cards are very, very popular and they're
[46:39.970 --> 46:45.010]  very expensive. Actually, I bought a box for this thing, this live stream that we may do,
[46:45.090 --> 46:49.690]  and it cost me like one hundred fucking twenty dollars, which I'm hoping will be worth it in
[46:49.690 --> 46:54.030]  the end. But they as a part of it, they're we're looking for chase cards, things to look for.
[46:54.270 --> 46:59.310]  And they make these autograph cards, but they're quote autograph cards. So the characters will
[46:59.310 --> 47:04.850]  put like a famous quote that that they said down and then they'll sign their name. So as you can
[47:04.850 --> 47:10.010]  see, like here's an image of some you can see like Arya Stark there said Maisie Williams said
[47:10.010 --> 47:14.710]  Valar Morghulis. That makes sense. Jamie Lannister just wrote Kingslayer. The guy that plays the
[47:14.710 --> 47:20.210]  hound wrote I like to kill people. But my favorite my second favorite on the left is the lady who was
[47:20.210 --> 47:24.490]  one of the one of the mean religious shame ladies. She just wrote shame and an exclamation point
[47:25.010 --> 47:28.430]  and signed her name, which I want to get now. I think that's fucking phenomenal.
[47:28.650 --> 47:33.010]  But on top of that, the dude that plays Hodor, his card, he just wrote Hodor,
[47:33.010 --> 47:37.570]  Hodor, and then signed his name. It's like Gus's shirt.
[47:40.670 --> 47:46.790]  That shame. Hannah Waddingham, I think is the name. Yeah. Ted Lasso. Have you seen that?
[47:47.050 --> 47:50.390]  No, I haven't. But everybody tells me it's pretty good. Yeah. Is she good in it?
[47:50.650 --> 47:55.630]  She's amazing in it. All right, well, calm down. We'll resell it. Anyway, I thought those were
[47:55.630 --> 47:59.970]  funny. And then, Andrew, you found some weird you found some lost shit that was really bizarre.
[47:59.970 --> 48:04.210]  I did. I found I was trying to get I didn't save the photo of one. Do you remember that character
[48:04.210 --> 48:08.790]  that had the eyepatch? Hurley's in like season? No, not Hurley. I'm talking about a different card
[48:08.790 --> 48:13.710]  first. The there's the eyepatch guy. He was like bald and he was menacing. He worked for the
[48:13.710 --> 48:21.290]  Dharma Initiative. Is he the guy who kills Charlie? Yeah. Drowns. Yeah. The grenade thing.
[48:21.350 --> 48:25.930]  Yeah. He just did. They had a series of cards that were just his eyepatch from the show,
[48:25.930 --> 48:30.530]  which seems super inconvenient for like that character that I like the idea of like stealing
[48:30.530 --> 48:34.770]  someone's eyepatch and then cutting into pieces and selling it. But even better than that,
[48:34.830 --> 48:40.590]  there was a Hurley card and the great the rare piece with authentic show item. And it's just sand.
[48:40.910 --> 48:46.250]  It's just a sand Hurley card. I assume fake sand as well. Yeah, I assume they're not actually
[48:46.250 --> 48:51.950]  stealing. No, they're not stealing the beach. They're just grabbing the beach, calling it a card.
[48:53.230 --> 48:57.670]  Um, I just don't know. And I don't remember what the fake sand was for. I need to go back and see
[48:57.670 --> 49:03.910]  because I feel like they buried somebody with sand in that season. Well, he's got a in the photo on
[49:03.910 --> 49:08.930]  the card. He's got a like a container and it looks like a skull or something in the sand. Well, I
[49:08.930 --> 49:15.510]  know Nikki and Paulo died, but I think other people get killed in that season. Oh, yeah,
[49:15.530 --> 49:21.350]  they get buried alive because they have that paralysis. That is true. They bury them. But
[49:21.350 --> 49:25.450]  I don't know if Hurley did that. I feel like Hurley was he was in love with Libby and Libby
[49:25.450 --> 49:30.310]  gets shot. This turned way deeper into a lost conversation than I intended. That Paulo guy
[49:30.310 --> 49:35.970]  was that crazy looking dude in 300, wasn't he? The guy with all the shit in his face. Oh,
[49:36.050 --> 49:43.390]  the bad guy? Yeah. Xerxes. Yeah, well, he was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he was. I don't I can't
[49:43.390 --> 49:48.650]  think of him in any other role, though. It's 300 and lost. Was he in love, actually? No, was he?
[49:48.650 --> 49:57.050]  No, it was. I don't know. Doesn't really matter. There's some great stupid entertainment carts
[49:57.050 --> 50:02.150]  that exist. I don't know where it ranks on the towel. I think the towel collectible cards might
[50:02.150 --> 50:08.310]  be the greatest dumb thing I've ever seen. It's I was talking to we were we had this idea. There's
[50:08.310 --> 50:13.410]  no way we can accomplish this. But a card company, we're talking about this. Gavin needs to do like
[50:13.410 --> 50:19.550]  the grossest inserts. I've seen like I'd be so excited for cups like in the US, like a run of
[50:19.550 --> 50:24.870]  UFC cups. It's just the guy's cutlery, especially like if he was fighting against like the greatest
[50:24.870 --> 50:29.430]  of all time. Having a cup that was accidentally kicked by like an amazing fighter would be a
[50:29.430 --> 50:34.690]  fantastic like that'd be pretty good. But I don't know. Is there anything else we want to talk about
[50:34.690 --> 50:38.390]  the stream thing? I feel like we're still planning. No, no, no. Just we're still in the planning
[50:38.390 --> 50:41.590]  phases. We got a long way to go, but we've got some really funny stuff that I'm pretty excited
[50:41.590 --> 50:45.450]  about. And we figured out the perfect role for Gavin on Sunday, which I'm really jazzed about,
[50:45.590 --> 50:50.210]  too. I'm actually a little jealous of Gavin. It's the role I've always wanted to play in something.
[50:50.670 --> 50:55.050]  So I'm a little I'm a little jealous that he gets to do it. But yeah, yeah, we'll figure that out.
[50:55.110 --> 50:58.370]  And then that'll happen some point or we won't. And it won't. And then you'll never hear from
[50:58.370 --> 51:06.590]  it again either way. Really behind this idea? I just, you know, I like to set expectations
[51:07.450 --> 51:14.890]  low, as it were. Do you go? Eric said it's I'll make sure it doesn't happen. Wow. I want to quiz
[51:14.890 --> 51:19.110]  Eric on his lost knowledge. He seems to be on the or is he just Googling it? I think he's Eric. Do
[51:19.110 --> 51:23.230]  you know Lost? What a weird collectible. Yeah, I like Lost a lot. I think that was probably like
[51:23.230 --> 51:28.050]  the last TV show that I watched where it was like worth my time. Hmm. You think the ending was worth
[51:28.050 --> 51:32.410]  your time? Yeah. You know, I didn't hate the ending. I didn't you know, I didn't love where
[51:32.830 --> 51:37.270]  how long it took to get there, but I didn't hate the ending. I didn't hate the ending the way that
[51:37.270 --> 51:40.770]  everyone like that, like a lot of other people hated it. I thought I was good. It's like the
[51:40.770 --> 51:44.930]  Sopranos. I like that ending too. I like the ending ending, but I thought all of that being
[51:44.930 --> 51:51.230]  like nullified by it. It's ah, let's not get into it. Nullified? What are you talking about?
[51:51.290 --> 51:57.130]  Well, all of like the alternate reality stuff turns out to be a load of bollocks. Not real.
[51:57.610 --> 52:00.850]  No, because that was the finding. Listen, you really want to talk about this,
[52:00.850 --> 52:05.490]  no one wants to hear it. You guys are going to give if there's any audience that's listening to
[52:05.490 --> 52:09.570]  this, it's a holdover from the RT podcast. They're going to get PTSD. We spent years
[52:09.570 --> 52:16.330]  talking about that show and they begged us not to. If you do, I can tell you a story about
[52:16.330 --> 52:20.990]  the most treacherous horse ride of all time, if you'd like. Yeah, I'd love to hear it. All right.
[52:21.110 --> 52:26.790]  So a couple weeks ago, Emily and I were out in West Texas in the desert. We went to we were in
[52:26.790 --> 52:32.610]  the mountains, kind of near Big Bend. And we noticed that there was an ad that we were looking
[52:32.610 --> 52:38.310]  for stuff to do. And I like to ride horses. She's a big horseback rider as well. A lot of fun. And
[52:38.310 --> 52:44.730]  so we found a place that did horseback riding that was open and appeared safe and everything
[52:44.730 --> 52:50.590]  with COVID protocols. And it was like a small group. So we scheduled it for like late in the
[52:50.590 --> 52:56.770]  day. It was like a sunset thing. Thought that'd be fun. And we drove out there and we get to this
[52:57.290 --> 53:03.770]  place. And first off, it's giant. It's on the side of a mountain and there's nobody there. And we
[53:04.210 --> 53:09.710]  walk around going through like restaurants and buildings and stuff. And it's just like a ghost
[53:09.710 --> 53:14.470]  town. And it and suddenly I feel like somebody's behind every window staring at us, you know,
[53:14.510 --> 53:18.350]  like it was super creepy. And I thought like, oh, we're gonna get murdered. There's like one road
[53:18.350 --> 53:21.890]  out. We're like, we're deep into this place. This is a little scary. And then a lady showed up and
[53:21.890 --> 53:27.810]  she was totally normal and it was fine. But she put us on these horses. And she goes,
[53:28.010 --> 53:32.450]  while we're getting on the horses, she goes, do you guys want to wear helmets? And I go,
[53:32.590 --> 53:37.310]  well, yeah, of course. And she goes, okay, you don't have to. And I go, well, yeah, but we're
[53:37.310 --> 53:40.490]  horseback riding. And she's like, yeah, that's fine. The helmets are over there. And as we're
[53:40.490 --> 53:44.150]  going over there, I was like, do we have to wear a helmet? And she's like, I just have to.
[53:44.270 --> 53:48.270]  I'm just required to recommend you wear them. But and I was like, are you gonna wear a helmet? And
[53:48.270 --> 53:52.990]  she's like, no, probably not. And I was like, I guess I won't wear a helmet then. Why not? And
[53:53.890 --> 53:58.170]  that turned out to be fine, the decision, but it was a huge mistake that I realized instantly.
[53:58.450 --> 54:01.930]  And I'll tell you why. And I will never ride a horse without a helmet again. Very dangerous.
[54:02.030 --> 54:08.570]  I won't do that. So she was like, it's a gentle trot. It's gonna be real easy. If you've ridden
[54:08.570 --> 54:12.710]  horses before, this is gonna be no problem. So it's not really dangerous. These are real calm
[54:12.710 --> 54:17.950]  horses. We're like, cool. Then she pointed us towards a mountain and we went straight up it.
[54:17.950 --> 54:26.850]  Like, like you see a goat hanging off the side of Everest up. And I look around and you realize
[54:26.850 --> 54:31.050]  that these mountains from a distance, you see these like green hills and they look kind of like
[54:31.050 --> 54:35.330]  as they go up and then you see like little rocks dotted out throughout it just looks really soft
[54:35.330 --> 54:46.570]  and pretty up close. It's it's it's limitless boulders that are jagged to like it's almost as
[54:46.570 --> 54:53.670]  if it's almost as if you took a razor blade and you made it a ball and and then covered the ground
[54:53.670 --> 54:58.610]  with rock ball razor blades. The horses are like stumbling around and I'm like, oh my lord.
[54:59.130 --> 55:03.790]  And I'm like, this is a little more cowboy than I have done before. And she's like, yeah, it's cool.
[55:03.850 --> 55:06.810]  These guys do this all the time. And she's like, keep it as calm and talking to us. But it's a
[55:06.810 --> 55:11.210]  little it's a little like we're going like straight up and then it's starting to get dark.
[55:11.310 --> 55:15.450]  We get really, really far up where and it's beautiful. There's like this huge sunset and
[55:15.450 --> 55:19.690]  stuff. But early on at this point, I look at Emily and I'm like, which one of these horses do you
[55:19.690 --> 55:24.170]  think we're going to have to shoot before this is over? Because I just imagine when these horses
[55:24.170 --> 55:29.410]  fall and break in a leg or something, you know, it's terrifying. And we get all the way up there
[55:29.890 --> 55:32.950]  and we're stopping and we're talking and we're kind of viewing the the vista and stuff. And
[55:32.950 --> 55:36.110]  she's like, OK, now we're going to go back down. And I turn around and I look down this mountain
[55:36.110 --> 55:39.290]  and I'm like, oh, I'm definitely dying. Like, there's no way I'm making it back down. It was
[55:39.290 --> 55:45.250]  brutal getting up. And we go down and we're going down a little bit. And then we get to a point
[55:45.250 --> 55:50.070]  and it's a little rocky and she's like, yeah, we'll be a little careful over here. And then I
[55:50.070 --> 55:55.410]  don't know how to explain this other than it was me in the back, then Emily, then the rider, the
[55:55.410 --> 56:04.870]  trail ride and their horse. And the horse just out of the blue fell in slow motion and fell on the
[56:04.870 --> 56:12.790]  lady in slow motion on the side of at the top of a mountain as the sun was going down. And I had no
[56:12.790 --> 56:19.070]  cell service. I don't know how the fuck to. We're miles from civilization. I don't know where the
[56:19.070 --> 56:24.530]  fuck we are. And the horse just falls over on this lady. And I go, oh, my God, are you OK? And
[56:24.530 --> 56:28.650]  she just immediately goes, I'm fine. It's no big deal. Don't get off your horse. And I'm looking
[56:28.650 --> 56:33.150]  at Emily and I'm like, should we help her? She's like, it's OK. Just stay calm. It's not a big
[56:33.150 --> 56:40.030]  deal. I'm fine. But from under the horse and then I'm like frozen. And I just like I just I like
[56:40.030 --> 56:44.010]  fish out my phone real fast to see if I have signal and I don't. And I'm like, this is all
[56:44.010 --> 56:48.490]  happening. It probably happens in 15 seconds, but it feels like a year, you know, and because I'm
[56:48.490 --> 56:56.770]  just looking around and all I see is is Desert Mountain. That's darkness, a jagged, boulder
[56:57.490 --> 57:03.030]  filled, razor bladed path going down that I don't even know where it goes. We're going down a
[57:03.030 --> 57:08.730]  different way that we came up. Not that I could have figured it out the other way either. I'm
[57:08.730 --> 57:12.490]  thinking this lady's going to die. How do I pick up a thousand pound horse? She's trapped under it.
[57:12.690 --> 57:17.130]  She's laying on all these jagged rocks like this is like we're going to have to medevac somebody
[57:17.130 --> 57:20.250]  like there's gonna be a helicopter. You know, she's going to be like the lady. We're going to
[57:20.250 --> 57:24.470]  strap her in. She's going to spin. You know, I'm like, I don't know how this is. Am I going to be
[57:24.470 --> 57:29.090]  able to get back by tonight? Like, am I going to freeze up here on the mountain? How do we all
[57:29.090 --> 57:32.130]  the stuff's going through my head in about 10 seconds? And then she just yells at the horse.
[57:32.170 --> 57:35.190]  She's like, I don't remember the horse's name. So I'm gonna say Bill. She's like, get up, Bill.
[57:35.190 --> 57:40.830]  And the horse goes, it doesn't move. And she goes, Bill, get up. And then the horse just fucking
[57:40.830 --> 57:49.090]  un-crashes. Like it just in slow motion stands back up and the lady just stands up. She just
[57:49.090 --> 57:52.830]  like dusts her legs off, hops on the horse and just takes off. It's like, all right, sorry about
[57:52.830 --> 57:58.010]  that. Let's keep going. Like it was no big deal. I like in your mind, you had already started
[57:58.010 --> 58:01.790]  visualizing. I'm going to have to cut her horse open and hide inside it while she's underneath.
[58:02.650 --> 58:05.870]  I'm it's exactly it's like, all right, we need to I'll take one of the I'll take one of the
[58:05.870 --> 58:10.230]  razor blade rocks and I'll taunt on the horse. Right. I'll stuff Emily and she'll that'll keep
[58:10.230 --> 58:15.210]  her warm. I don't know. I'll bathe and I'll use the intros, I guess that'll keep me warm. I don't
[58:15.210 --> 58:19.450]  know. You know, and then it's like, I don't know how to set a broken bone. I figure the lady's got
[58:19.450 --> 58:23.890]  hours to live, Max. I figure her lungs have collapsed, you know, and it was she was totally
[58:23.890 --> 58:27.850]  just like, just like, yeah, that never happens. But, uh, you know, it's why you got to be careful.
[58:27.850 --> 58:31.950]  Anyway, keep going. And then we just go down pretty as you please. Had a wonderful rest of
[58:31.950 --> 58:38.030]  the ride. And what about our day? Was that the most stressful sunset that you've had?
[58:38.250 --> 58:43.790]  That was the most horrific sunset I have experienced in 45 years. It was beautiful.
[58:44.130 --> 58:48.290]  But I was like, if that lady hadn't been OK, I might still be up there.
[58:49.770 --> 58:55.170]  I'm also reasonably certain because we were on a desert in the desert on a mountain
[58:55.830 --> 59:03.370]  surrounded by rocks and cactuses and shit. I am convinced that had I had to get off that horse,
[59:03.430 --> 59:09.530]  I would have been eaten by snakes within 15 minutes. They would have devoured. They would
[59:09.530 --> 59:14.170]  have. They would have found they would have found like half of my shoe. And that'd be the only way
[59:14.170 --> 59:20.470]  they knew that Emily and I were even there. That'd be like a horse femur and half my shoe.
[59:21.030 --> 59:25.730]  And that would be that they would put a they'd put a fucking they'd make one of those rock graves
[59:25.730 --> 59:30.410]  as a marker for me. And like somebody would put two sticks together and they'd wrap it with
[59:30.410 --> 59:34.750]  fucking twine and stick it in. They'd be like, we think he probably got eaten here.
[59:35.030 --> 59:41.270]  I just love the idea of them finding three dead horses, two dead people and a bloated snake like
[59:41.270 --> 59:48.270]  slithering off like the other guy must have left. Not even a snake. He said snakes like a gang of
[59:48.270 --> 59:57.730]  snakes made an alliance just for Geoff. Anyway, anyway, I just mentioned maybe maybe I shouldn't
[59:57.730 --> 01:00:01.230]  imagine that I didn't wear a helmet, but I just wanted to like always wear a helmet safety first
[01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:07.510]  before I had a momentary lapse in judgment. I was fine. It worked out OK. But the second I started
[01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:11.270]  to go up that mountain, I realized that if I were to fall off that horse, I was going to die. It's
[01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:15.570]  amazing that the lady didn't die. She was fine. She might have come across stronger because of it.
[01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:22.110]  She was a pro, but I was terrified for the hour and a half that I was doing that. Are you worried
[01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:28.150]  about the helmet centric comment leavers by saying that? Oh, no. I assume that they'll say
[01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:33.210]  wear a helmet, idiot. And I'll go. I agree. I totally agree. Totally. Yeah. Andrew, before we
[01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:39.810]  wrap up this one, I know that you've opened up FFaceBits at Gmail.com. Yeah. That's a great point.
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:44.910]  More or less than 50 percent of the emails have been people telling you to eat the pencil.
[01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:51.230]  Oh, I mean, I've gotten a lot of emails. I'm working through them. There's currently 447
[01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:57.590]  that I've yet to touch. Not many, I feel like, are pens. What I was more surprised by, and I guess I
[01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:02.310]  shouldn't have been surprised by this because I said it in a way that was a declaration of war,
[01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.590]  but I'd already talked about it on Twitter beforehand, so I didn't really think about it
[01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:09.790]  as that actually be the inspiration for it, for going after Geoff with the Portapotti Armada.
[01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:15.190]  A lot of people willing to sign up to go against Geoff. That's what I'd say an overwhelming majority
[01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:20.030]  have been subject lined as. And that's not really what that email's intended for. It's just like if
[01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:25.750]  you have something you want to contribute in some way. Also, and it's a mistake in a sense of it's
[01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:30.130]  wonderful. It's been so exciting seeing all the different skills and talents and how amazing
[01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:35.190]  people are in the community with what they can do. But it's just a constant reminder of how useless I
[01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:41.570]  am creatively or artistically. It is just the extent and just the volume of which people are
[01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:47.370]  talented is impressive. Feel free to email that email at fxbits at gmail.com. That felt like a
[01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.270]  whole promo wasn't intended to be. It's just genuinely super impressive what people are
[01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:57.710]  able to do. I would refute that, Andrew. I think you are creative and artistic in different ways.
[01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:04.310]  Yeah. Like you're mentioning, we're talking about this whole thing and about the Portapotti Armada.
[01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:09.310]  If you hadn't sent the Portapotti, if you hadn't had that creative artistic idea to
[01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:14.530]  send a ludicrous pink Portapotti to threaten it and then to actually do it, we wouldn't have the
[01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:20.030]  idea to stuff all of us in the Portapotti, including Eric, and make us record an entire
[01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:25.190]  album called the Pink Album. That wouldn't exist. That's art that's going to exist because of you.
[01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:29.170]  Could we do like a hands on a hard body scenario of like the last? Well,
[01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.870]  no, nobody wants to win the Portapotti. I was going to say last person in the Portapotti
[01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:36.470]  gets the Portapotti, but nobody wants to just be a rush to try to get out.
[01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:40.430]  First person out has to win. First person out wins the Portapotti.
[01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:45.310]  I like that idea. That could be even better. Yeah. Flipping it. Whoever can last the longest.
[01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:47.850]  Oh, not even the longest. Just has to outlast the other.
[01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:52.430]  What are the chances that all four of us fit in? I don't know. You're going to have to get into
[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:55.630]  the end, which is another reason why it's good nobody Peter pooped, because you're going to have
[01:02:55.630 --> 01:03:01.090]  to get into the toilet. Probably you're the smallest. You're you're very you're very limber.
[01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:05.690]  So it's going to have to be you. What what we'll do is we'll put Andrew,
[01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:11.610]  I was thinking we'll put you sit on the you would put you in the Portapotti and then maybe I could
[01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:16.030]  sit around it. So your head's coming out of the toilet, Gavin, between your legs. Yeah,
[01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:21.270]  between my legs and then I come back and then we'll have Eric can kind of wedge in because
[01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:25.130]  Eric's got to produce it. He can kind of wedge in by the urinal. Oh, I was imagining Eric like
[01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:29.590]  Sam Fisher up in the ceiling. So we could do that. We can maybe do that, too. There is there is
[01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:34.690]  they are taller than than wide. Right. So there's more vertical space. And then Andrew's just like
[01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:40.090]  in the in the main floor area. But and then I'll be at the lobby. He's in the lobby.
[01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:46.490]  And then and then I figure we'll we'll mic ourselves up and then we'll record whatever
[01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:51.430]  an album is. I think 44 minutes and then we'll call it the pink album. But we'll have to we'll
[01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:55.210]  have to do that post covid like that might be a year from now. That's just someday. Yeah,
[01:03:55.210 --> 01:04:00.630]  it would be. I think that'd be probably the least enjoyable podcast maybe record
[01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:04.150]  and roosterteeth history. I'd imagine. I think that's what the audience is betting on.
[01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:09.230]  I just would be terrible. Yeah, I think it would be funny for like maybe the first two minutes and
[01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:14.070]  then it would occur what we'd have to do for the rest of the show. Yeah. I mean, we saw how long
[01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:20.450]  Geoff lasted in there just on his own. It was about 90 seconds. You almost got stuck inside the
[01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:26.570]  I don't think you mentioned. Yeah, we didn't talk about that. I did briefly get stuck inside the
[01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:36.850]  body and went from zero to call 911 in my head very quickly. My leg, my left leg got
[01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:43.690]  wedged in a way that it was instantly painful and I didn't think I could get out. And I was like
[01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:48.750]  pushing on it, trying to figure out how to break the metal brads to like like like Hulk myself
[01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:55.130]  out of the porta potty, you know, like just push the thing apart. And then luckily I was able to,
[01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:59.650]  in a fucking panic, just like just vibrate my way out of there real fast.
[01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:06.950]  However, I think that I think that the idea of us stuffed into a porta potty,
[01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:11.050]  much like people used to stuff in the phone booths, I think is so funny that the comedy
[01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:16.110]  will be. Is anyone claustrophobic? Yeah, I'm not not claustrophobic. No, I'm good.
[01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:21.130]  You're good. Good as far as that goes. Yeah, I like that. Geoff said in a way that it'd be hard
[01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:26.730]  to believe that his brain went from zero to 15, called the police when his last story was a
[01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:31.890]  person fell over and he immediately was ready to bury the body, cut open the horse and die on a
[01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:36.550]  hill due to a body mistakes. It's very believable, Geoff. Well, you did not have to sell us on the
[01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:44.850]  immediate panic of going 911. Dude, I was fucking scared for like maybe eight seconds. You got in
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:49.650]  the porta potty. I was impressed of how deep I was. I was hoping to get all the way in and like
[01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:56.290]  below. So I wasn't visible. I'm not possible. I'm I'm a little too tall for that. But I think Gavin
[01:05:56.290 --> 01:06:01.630]  might be able to do it. Or am I going to be more cramped than that time you buried me in a coffin?
[01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:09.930]  You buried Gavin in a hill? Yeah, you'll be. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you'll be you'll be less
[01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:17.070]  immediately immobile like you won't be buried under like a foot of dirt like you were like in
[01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:21.170]  the coffin. You were stuck. You couldn't dig your way out of that. You couldn't have. There was so
[01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:25.090]  much weight on top of you. You wouldn't have been able to push the top off. Also, I we hammered it
[01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:28.370]  in. So you were hammered into the coffin as well. So you could have you couldn't have gotten out
[01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:33.410]  regardless. I couldn't even bend my knees to like kick against the lid like I couldn't get my my
[01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:38.230]  legs that way. Yeah, but you were squishy. You were you were late. You were stretched out in the
[01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:44.310]  you're going to be pretzeled in the port-a-potty. That's going to be more frustrating. Okay. Why?
[01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:51.890]  What's what? Why? Why? Why was he buried in a coffin? Oh, if you had if you had an opportunity
[01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:57.490]  to bury Gavin, wouldn't you? No, it's fair. It's a great point. I built I built I built a two season
[01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:02.850]  ghost hunting show around the idea of covering Gavin in pig's blood and putting him in the
[01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:08.210]  naked in a field so that he could attract a chupacabra, which we never got to do.
[01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:12.210]  And bury Gavin alive was the other idea. I accomplished one of those two ideas.
[01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:18.670]  I also tied me to a train track and then and then got a fake train to come up the track, scare the
[01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:25.090]  shit out of me. I did do that. Geoff with budget is dangerous. I'm actually glad that Eric can't
[01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:30.710]  secure any money for the show. Okay, well, we should wrap up. We're getting yelled at by our
[01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:39.370]  incredibly angry producer. All right. You guys got anything else you want to say? Take it away,
[01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:46.770]  Andrew. I what do we ever make a definitive call and what color hot dog is brown? Is that I think
[01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:54.930]  it's pinkish brown, pink and brown. Okay, I'm I'm going to try to retreat away from my orange
[01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:59.630]  nature's orange statements and try to put as much distance between me and that stupid moment as
[01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:04.450]  possible. So, okay, I'm embracing pink and I'm embracing pink and brown and I'm going to pretend
[01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:09.790]  like the color orange never existed. Perfect. Why don't you wrap it up, Gavin? Oh, see that?
[01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:13.130]  See that subtle play I just did there. That wasn't even a joke at all. I just gave it to
[01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:16.850]  you. I just made you hold it. That's really good. Yeah, that's a professional move right there.
[01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:23.790]  That was a pro graceful. Thanks for that. Thank you. How are you worse than Geoff is like,
[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:28.910]  if you do it bad once, you never get asked to do it again. So no, that's a great point. But
[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:33.030]  now you you revealed that. So it's a ruin. What do you mean? At least he fucking did it.
[01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:37.010]  You passed it off. Well, yeah, I asked a great question, I feel like. And then I passed out.
[01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:40.130]  You want me to close the show? I'll close the fucking show. Thank you for listening
[01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:46.150]  to another. What episode is this? Forty seven. Forty seven. Thank you for listening. Episode
[01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:51.930]  sixteen. Forty seven. That's a great point. He never said save my neck conversation.
[01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:56.990]  He's dodging you. Oh, oh, that's a cliffhanger. Oh, and because people real fast. We're saying
[01:08:56.990 --> 01:09:00.190]  goodbye. Emergency went long. We're saying goodbye. And we're wrapping it up, Eric. And
[01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:03.050]  this is us saying goodbye. Love you. See you next week and all that stuff. But before we go,
[01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:06.990]  I do want to mention that we don't want to make you guys wait for a whole year
[01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:11.250]  to get a pink album. So we are going to. I think the plan is to make episode 16
[01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:16.970]  the series as a record thing. And thank you for listening. And what is it called? Review
[01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:22.930]  and rate and do the stars and suck all the butts. Face out. Come and leave.
