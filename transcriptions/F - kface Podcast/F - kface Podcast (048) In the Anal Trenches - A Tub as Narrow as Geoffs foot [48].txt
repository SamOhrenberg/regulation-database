[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  Mom, Dad, my body is growing at an alarming rate.
[00:03.440 --> 00:07.220]  And the clothes you buy me now will be very small very soon.
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.640]  But your wallet doesn't have to suffer because of fashion
[00:09.640 --> 00:12.020]  with the low prices of Amazon's back-to-schools.
[00:12.700 --> 00:14.780]  Amazon, spend less, smile more.
[00:15.060 --> 00:19.580]  You've heard me talk about how convenient HelloFresh's contact-free delivery is forever.
[00:19.760 --> 00:21.960]  But it's been especially helpful this past year.
[00:22.220 --> 00:22.960]  Haven't signed up yet?
[00:23.240 --> 00:26.460]  Well, right now you can get 12 free meals, including free shipping,
[00:26.460 --> 00:32.140]  when you go to hellofresh.com slash 12face and use code 12face.
[00:33.360 --> 00:35.760]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:47.520 --> 00:48.760]  All right, go for the intro.
[00:49.440 --> 00:51.040]  Welcome to F*** Face?
[00:51.700 --> 00:52.400]  Not a question.
[00:52.580 --> 00:54.980]  All right, that was the intro. That was Andrew's intro.
[00:55.080 --> 00:58.000]  Anyway, you were saying something about Nick.
[00:58.400 --> 00:59.840]  So I have a theory about Nick.
[01:00.040 --> 01:03.620]  And I feel like because this has lasted across multiple weeks,
[01:03.620 --> 01:08.180]  it's going to be a huge letdown because it's a very tiny, you know,
[01:08.240 --> 01:10.500]  not an important theory I've had about Nick.
[01:10.920 --> 01:11.900]  Here's the thing about Nick.
[01:12.340 --> 01:14.520]  Nick is probably our best editor, right?
[01:14.980 --> 01:17.660]  I don't like the episodes that he doesn't edit.
[01:18.800 --> 01:20.340]  We've had editors who...
[01:20.340 --> 01:22.820]  Well, we've had editors who just gave up.
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.260]  They're just like, I'm not doing that.
[01:25.720 --> 01:27.480]  Shots f***ing fired.
[01:27.780 --> 01:32.020]  We've had some other good ones, but I feel like Nick needs the fewest notes.
[01:32.020 --> 01:34.800]  He's always like cutting out stuff that we clearly don't want.
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.960]  And even if we don't mention it,
[01:36.020 --> 01:38.960]  he's probably cutting out us eating and breathing down the mic hole.
[01:39.360 --> 01:39.980]  Very good.
[01:40.380 --> 01:43.340]  And the best part about it, almost no feedback every week.
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.880]  Well, I think it's because Nick has been around since...
[01:47.880 --> 01:50.840]  He understands what F*** Face is because he's helped to build it, right?
[01:51.060 --> 01:51.200]  Yeah.
[01:52.460 --> 01:56.340]  But I feel like whenever we talk to Nick on the podcast,
[01:56.740 --> 01:58.360]  he comes in and he's like,
[02:00.020 --> 02:03.040]  And he's sort of flubbing all over his words.
[02:03.140 --> 02:04.320]  He's not making much sense.
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.420]  But when the episode comes out, he speaks with perfect articulation.
[02:09.700 --> 02:11.440]  He is very well spoken.
[02:11.700 --> 02:13.040]  And my theory is this.
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.700]  He is re-recording his input to these episodes.
[02:19.420 --> 02:21.320]  I think he's doing ADR.
[02:21.520 --> 02:23.840]  I think he's doing replacement takes.
[02:24.640 --> 02:27.960]  I 100, 100% agree with that and believe that that's happening.
[02:27.960 --> 02:28.620]  Thoughts, Nick?
[02:29.080 --> 02:30.160]  Yeah, that's happened twice.
[02:32.640 --> 02:33.360]  Absolutely, 100%.
[02:34.900 --> 02:37.920]  Part of the reason I do it, though, part of the reason I do it, though,
[02:37.940 --> 02:40.580]  is because Gavin will turn to me or like,
[02:40.680 --> 02:42.820]  I assume he's turning to me in these moments and like,
[02:42.940 --> 02:43.940]  Nick, what do you have to say?
[02:44.080 --> 02:44.660]  And I'm like,
[02:45.380 --> 02:49.100]  I better open a recording program and I have no way to match up my audio.
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.380]  So later on, I just am like,
[02:51.440 --> 02:52.660]  Oh, this is this is s***.
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.180]  I'm just going to re-record my audio.
[02:57.580 --> 02:59.540]  First off, Gavin, excellent ear.
[02:59.780 --> 03:00.500]  Great job.
[03:01.280 --> 03:04.980]  And secondly, I think that is the right of the editor, right?
[03:05.220 --> 03:10.400]  Like back in the old days before f***face and all this stuff,
[03:10.580 --> 03:13.140]  you know, we used to at the day job, Bruce Teeth,
[03:13.260 --> 03:15.280]  I used to make a cartoon called Red vs. Blue.
[03:15.380 --> 03:19.520]  And I did most of the audio recording and editing for most of the seasons.
[03:20.000 --> 03:20.940]  And I would wait.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.040]  And I was also a character, right?
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.080]  So I would do my lines like everybody else.
[03:24.080 --> 03:26.840]  And then after everybody would go home for the day,
[03:26.900 --> 03:28.320]  I would re-record everything I did,
[03:28.440 --> 03:32.900]  like three or four or sometimes 60 or 70 times until it sounded decent.
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.660]  And nobody ever had to know.
[03:34.800 --> 03:35.640]  And I didn't talk about it.
[03:35.800 --> 03:39.120]  But I guarantee you that character Griff had more lines re-recorded
[03:39.120 --> 03:41.520]  than the rest of the rest of the characters put together.
[03:42.560 --> 03:43.580]  I'm kind of bummed though.
[03:43.680 --> 03:45.860]  It's like let's f***ing maybe maybe take 300.
[03:45.880 --> 03:46.340]  It'll be better.
[03:46.420 --> 03:46.880]  I don't care.
[03:47.020 --> 03:47.800]  It's, you know, it doesn't matter.
[03:48.140 --> 03:50.180]  When I'm sort of bumbling my way through these points,
[03:50.220 --> 03:51.940]  sometimes I wish I could do a redo.
[03:51.940 --> 03:56.040]  But yeah, maybe I'll start submitting separate takes of stuff after the episode.
[03:56.220 --> 03:57.600]  That won't complicate things.
[03:57.780 --> 04:02.500]  Would you say, here you are talking about how Nick has gone back and edited
[04:03.520 --> 04:06.160]  a more cogent response in.
[04:06.860 --> 04:09.380]  How do you feel about editing stuff out of the episode, Gavin?
[04:10.200 --> 04:10.880]  What do you mean?
[04:11.380 --> 04:12.740]  Well, like having stuff removed.
[04:13.180 --> 04:13.720]  What's your point?
[04:14.140 --> 04:14.500]  What's your point?
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.180]  Just curious.
[04:15.700 --> 04:16.180]  I've done it.
[04:16.700 --> 04:16.900]  Yeah.
[04:17.280 --> 04:19.040]  That is, that is a set.
[04:19.420 --> 04:21.200]  Here's the, yeah, we have all done it.
[04:21.200 --> 04:25.700]  If a conversation sort of trails off into nothing and it's like, what was the point of even,
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.260]  nah, just lop it off?
[04:27.500 --> 04:29.680]  Or if it's just too gross, we've done that before.
[04:30.420 --> 04:33.320]  Here's the, Geoff is teeing me up is what he's doing.
[04:35.640 --> 04:37.280]  Geoff, this is like.
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.020]  One of these episodes, it's one of these behind the scenes arguing episodes.
[04:42.260 --> 04:45.860]  Gavin, I want you to know that I decided I was not going to bring this up.
[04:46.960 --> 04:48.320]  I'd mentioned it to Geoff.
[04:48.720 --> 04:50.460]  Well, you didn't tell me you weren't going to bring it up.
[04:50.460 --> 04:53.880]  No, I didn't, but I didn't think you'd fucking tee me up for it either.
[04:53.980 --> 04:55.360]  Oh, come on, I'm a professional.
[04:55.560 --> 04:56.920]  This is my day job.
[04:57.020 --> 04:58.180]  What else am I going to do?
[04:58.360 --> 04:59.220]  Fair enough.
[05:00.300 --> 05:06.620]  But I was, you, you got, and I don't know to what extent, Gavin, but we, we talked about,
[05:06.900 --> 05:09.240]  we talked about a butt blood incident.
[05:11.200 --> 05:14.060]  And I didn't plan on bringing that up on the show.
[05:14.320 --> 05:17.200]  That was the thing that was brought up because you brought it up.
[05:17.200 --> 05:20.800]  And I was like, I don't think I really want to talk about this.
[05:20.800 --> 05:22.040]  Well, I was worried about you.
[05:22.140 --> 05:25.480]  I was just making it clear that we need to know when you're bleeding from the anus.
[05:25.740 --> 05:26.580]  So we can keep tabs.
[05:27.020 --> 05:29.660]  I don't, that's not necessarily a podcast talk.
[05:29.980 --> 05:31.180]  This is entertainment.
[05:31.500 --> 05:33.160]  It's called fucking F*** Face.
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.560]  It's a comedy show.
[05:35.880 --> 05:38.580]  And this is, so I was like, I'm not going to bring this up at all.
[05:38.700 --> 05:39.420]  You brought it up.
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.220]  And then Geoff thought my fucking John Voight joke was the funniest thing ever.
[05:43.260 --> 05:45.480]  So I was like, fuck, then I can't remove this.
[05:45.480 --> 05:47.860]  It was a really funny joke.
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.640]  But then I learned because you mentioned this on the RT podcast,
[05:52.760 --> 05:54.800]  which is why I even feel comfortable bringing it up at all.
[05:54.980 --> 05:59.840]  You had a story yourself that you had edited from the show.
[06:00.220 --> 06:01.540]  And I was deep.
[06:01.620 --> 06:05.620]  I was like, I didn't want to talk about this, but I know Gavin has a story too.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.620]  We're in the anal trenches together.
[06:07.940 --> 06:09.560]  I'm willing to ride this out.
[06:09.600 --> 06:11.980]  And I feel like you kind of just left me.
[06:13.280 --> 06:14.300]  That's how it felt.
[06:15.020 --> 06:17.020]  I don't know to what extent what was edited.
[06:17.660 --> 06:20.460]  I just know that you requested because it was gross.
[06:20.580 --> 06:23.500]  It's a super fucking gross episode without a doubt.
[06:23.760 --> 06:26.520]  The episode overall, I just thought was so disgusting.
[06:27.100 --> 06:27.300]  Yeah.
[06:27.520 --> 06:30.660]  Uh, Nick's saying that it was like 20 minutes of the episode.
[06:30.860 --> 06:35.000]  I had about 50 seconds cut just because I was telling I was just going back.
[06:35.060 --> 06:36.280]  I was trying to make you feel comfortable, Andrew.
[06:36.400 --> 06:37.980]  I was telling my butt story.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.560]  Yeah, but yeah, no, I get it.
[06:39.640 --> 06:42.180]  When I listened to it back, I was like, this provides nothing.
[06:42.180 --> 06:44.320]  And it's very disgusting.
[06:44.580 --> 06:45.560]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[06:45.780 --> 06:47.380]  Disgusting than Andrew's butt story.
[06:47.800 --> 06:50.860]  But then you go on to do the disgusting cupcake story.
[06:50.960 --> 06:53.560]  And I didn't feel as bad to be honest, but I felt like it added nothing.
[06:53.660 --> 06:55.540]  And I was happy to, I was happy to lose it.
[06:55.900 --> 06:57.080]  But here's the thing, Gavin.
[06:57.440 --> 06:59.800]  I felt okay going forward.
[06:59.880 --> 07:03.480]  I'm like, because we're in this together and you just left.
[07:03.580 --> 07:05.100]  So now I'm just stuck.
[07:05.460 --> 07:05.960]  I'm stuck.
[07:06.100 --> 07:09.400]  I'm just like, I didn't factor in the ability of you retreating.
[07:09.400 --> 07:14.000]  You know, when they build like an arched bridge over like a river or something,
[07:14.120 --> 07:16.880]  and they build support beams while they're building a bridge.
[07:17.020 --> 07:20.080]  And then at the end, once the bridge is built, they demolish the beams.
[07:20.340 --> 07:21.160]  And they just crumble away.
[07:21.460 --> 07:24.540]  I was just your anal beams, Andrew.
[07:27.220 --> 07:29.060]  Look, I didn't think, right.
[07:29.340 --> 07:34.040]  My story, I didn't, I didn't mind it being told because I told it.
[07:34.080 --> 07:35.060]  I was happy for that to be it.
[07:35.080 --> 07:37.020]  I just felt like listening back to it.
[07:37.020 --> 07:39.860]  It's just one disgusting thing after another.
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.460]  And mine wasn't even very funny.
[07:41.740 --> 07:42.800]  Mine was just like, ugh.
[07:43.180 --> 07:43.520]  I'm happy.
[07:43.720 --> 07:45.420]  I'm happy to tell it again and leave it in.
[07:45.500 --> 07:48.240]  I just felt like it was detrimental to the comedy.
[07:48.540 --> 07:49.380]  Oh God.
[07:49.600 --> 07:50.860]  I don't think we need to double back.
[07:51.020 --> 07:54.500]  It was just very much like, I felt like we were in, we were in it together.
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.700]  That was sort of my comfortability of it.
[07:56.720 --> 07:59.220]  Of like, I don't want to talk about this, but Gavin brought it up.
[07:59.440 --> 07:59.800]  You know what?
[07:59.940 --> 08:04.340]  Gavin, lack of a better word, also has blood on his hands for this.
[08:04.340 --> 08:05.640]  Will equally be...
[08:06.280 --> 08:07.000]  He's got blood on his shorts.
[08:08.900 --> 08:13.640]  Well, I mean, to be fair, I described what I cut when I was talking about the Rooster Teeth podcast.
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.440]  So there's no...
[08:14.440 --> 08:14.800]  You did.
[08:14.920 --> 08:15.900]  You mentioned it passing.
[08:16.380 --> 08:18.100]  But you also, that whole...
[08:18.100 --> 08:20.980]  I didn't realize that you did it in a reply, in your Slack.
[08:21.060 --> 08:23.400]  You did it in a reply thread, which is why I didn't see it.
[08:23.440 --> 08:26.560]  So it's like when I heard, I heard about it, someone told me that you were going to edit
[08:26.560 --> 08:26.880]  that out.
[08:26.920 --> 08:27.820]  And I was like, that motherfucker.
[08:27.980 --> 08:29.520]  He did it under the radar even.
[08:29.680 --> 08:30.820]  And then I noticed the reply thread.
[08:31.040 --> 08:34.320]  It's, I assume, easier for Nick if all the notes are below the episode.
[08:34.320 --> 08:35.140]  Absolutely.
[08:35.760 --> 08:37.240]  We're not chatting about bat knobs and shite.
[08:37.720 --> 08:39.100]  Yeah, totally fair.
[08:39.540 --> 08:45.260]  In future, I'll consult you when I tee you up for a nice bloody Ada story.
[08:45.740 --> 08:47.820]  I'll let you know if I'm thinking about cutting it.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.420]  I'm all good.
[08:49.580 --> 08:50.460]  I got checked out.
[08:50.520 --> 08:50.760]  I'm good.
[08:51.100 --> 08:52.640]  There's no, there are no issues.
[08:52.980 --> 08:55.580]  That was so fucking entertaining for me.
[08:55.640 --> 08:58.100]  I admit, looking back at it, I should have told you.
[08:58.180 --> 08:59.000]  And I apologize.
[08:59.560 --> 09:00.380]  I left you out there.
[09:00.880 --> 09:01.140]  Okay.
[09:01.400 --> 09:02.520]  In the anal trenches alone.
[09:02.680 --> 09:03.180]  You just left.
[09:03.280 --> 09:03.460]  Yeah.
[09:03.460 --> 09:10.140]  While we're apologizing, Gavin, that is a great natural segue for something that I'm
[09:10.140 --> 09:13.180]  gonna have to do that I'm not too fucking excited about.
[09:13.620 --> 09:17.220]  I do like, though, by the way, that Andrew didn't bring that up with me.
[09:17.360 --> 09:20.620]  He just, he just, he just bitched to you about it.
[09:20.780 --> 09:21.240]  No, no, no.
[09:21.240 --> 09:23.060]  This is why, this is why I did it.
[09:23.060 --> 09:25.440]  Because you requested something to be edited out.
[09:25.860 --> 09:29.100]  And I would never bring it up on the show if you wanted it to be removed.
[09:29.260 --> 09:31.880]  So I was asking Geoff, like, are the ethics of this okay?
[09:31.880 --> 09:35.400]  Because you mentioned it on the podcast, and I didn't know what your reasons necessarily
[09:35.400 --> 09:36.620]  were for wanting it to remove.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.980]  So it was more of a question to Geoff of, is this appropriate for me to even discuss
[09:40.980 --> 09:41.420]  on the show?
[09:41.440 --> 09:41.700]  Oh, absolutely.
[09:41.800 --> 09:43.460]  He threw you under the anal blood bus, dude.
[09:43.540 --> 09:45.080]  You have every right to talk about it.
[09:46.880 --> 09:48.060]  Every right to talk about it.
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.820]  I love some of the sentences coming out of this podcast.
[09:52.800 --> 10:00.280]  It is your God-given podcast right as a professional podcaster to address that Gavin
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.440]  faced you hard.
[10:02.640 --> 10:10.320]  Oh, speaking of facing, I don't like to do this, but I need to issue an official face
[10:10.320 --> 10:10.860]  retraction.
[10:11.100 --> 10:11.680]  Holy crap.
[10:11.760 --> 10:12.540]  We haven't had one of those.
[10:12.720 --> 10:13.160]  I don't know.
[10:13.240 --> 10:14.020]  I don't know that we have.
[10:14.460 --> 10:16.020]  But if we haven't, this will be the first.
[10:16.240 --> 10:16.740]  Hopefully the last.
[10:16.900 --> 10:18.740]  Yeah, I'm not proud of it.
[10:18.840 --> 10:19.980]  I'm not excited about it.
[10:20.300 --> 10:26.440]  I've been living with the guilt of something for about, I guess, two or three weeks now.
[10:26.820 --> 10:30.200]  And I'd be lying if I said it hasn't been kind of eaten away at me.
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.040]  And so I wanted to say this to Andrew a lot earlier, but I realized that everything that
[10:34.040 --> 10:36.360]  we do has to be filtered through the lens of this podcast.
[10:36.600 --> 10:37.280]  So I've been waiting.
[10:37.640 --> 10:41.140]  Andrew, I need to apologize to you and to the audience for something.
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.640]  And I feel really shitty about it.
[10:42.920 --> 10:43.140]  Yeah?
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.200]  I eviscerated you over sockless shoe wearing.
[10:49.320 --> 10:52.520]  I even thought in the moment, am I being a little too critical?
[10:52.760 --> 10:54.200]  And then I thought, who cares?
[10:54.620 --> 10:55.620]  Did you switch teams?
[10:55.620 --> 11:02.260]  However, I got on my bike about a week ago, not too long after you and I went for our bike ride,
[11:02.380 --> 11:02.800]  actually, Gavin.
[11:03.380 --> 11:08.360]  And I realized, I looked down and I realized I was wearing shoes without socks.
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.540]  And then I realized that I had somehow in that rant against Andrew, I had forgotten
[11:14.540 --> 11:19.260]  that I had a major life change about a year ago, around the time COVID started.
[11:19.880 --> 11:27.880]  And that was when I switched to an all bathing suit only wardrobe, right?
[11:28.140 --> 11:28.320]  Yeah.
[11:28.380 --> 11:32.100]  And as a part of that, I started taking my oldest shoes, my oldest vans,
[11:32.200 --> 11:36.240]  the ones that I use to cut the grass in, and I started wearing them without socks
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.580]  while I rode my bike.
[11:37.720 --> 11:43.320]  So I didn't have, you know, like, fucking, like, unburned sock legs, you know?
[11:43.320 --> 11:45.660]  So I don't walk around looking like I'm wearing socks when I'm not wearing socks.
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.980]  So it didn't look weird having socks on.
[11:47.980 --> 11:49.760]  And I do that almost every day.
[11:49.980 --> 11:52.440]  I wear shoes without socks almost every day when I ride a bicycle.
[11:52.600 --> 11:55.240]  And I fucking, I just, I just attacked you.
[11:56.300 --> 11:57.960]  Meanwhile, doing the exact same thing.
[11:58.020 --> 11:58.980]  And I just, I'm sorry.
[11:59.140 --> 11:59.740]  I really am.
[11:59.800 --> 12:01.680]  I will say, I still think it's gross.
[12:01.800 --> 12:04.840]  And I do, I realized I do wash those shoes once a week.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.560]  How, how could you?
[12:07.240 --> 12:09.220]  But I just like, I just blanked.
[12:09.260 --> 12:10.680]  Like, I'm 45, right?
[12:10.720 --> 12:13.320]  I was going off at 44 years of information.
[12:13.520 --> 12:16.260]  And I just forgot about 11 months of it.
[12:16.340 --> 12:17.380]  Like the most recent 11 months.
[12:17.380 --> 12:21.380]  I also had a giant bit about putting on the wrong sock every day.
[12:21.660 --> 12:23.020]  And sometimes you don't even wear them.
[12:23.240 --> 12:24.740]  I still, I wear socks every day.
[12:24.900 --> 12:25.320]  At some point.
[12:25.980 --> 12:26.700]  At some point, yeah.
[12:27.780 --> 12:29.640]  Wait, you've said you ride your bike every day.
[12:29.900 --> 12:30.920]  Yeah, I do now, just about.
[12:31.180 --> 12:36.220]  But it was also like, it was also, uh, I think coming out of winter and the snow stuff.
[12:36.280 --> 12:37.460]  And I hadn't been on the bike a lot.
[12:37.480 --> 12:39.060]  So it wasn't top of mind, you know?
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.220]  Like I hadn't been able to ride my bike in a lot lately.
[12:41.520 --> 12:44.580]  So, uh, now I've been, I've been, you know, I've ridden it every day except for today.
[12:44.580 --> 12:45.620]  Cause it's been rainy.
[12:45.620 --> 12:48.120]  But, uh, so anyway, Andrew, I'm sorry.
[12:48.420 --> 12:55.940]  I'm a dirty, no sock, shoe wearing scumbag who wears sockless shoes when he rides his bicycle.
[12:55.940 --> 12:58.580]  And he does it a couple hours a day, six days a week.
[12:59.300 --> 13:00.040]  And so I'm sorry.
[13:00.940 --> 13:02.480]  No, I guess I accept your apology.
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.080]  But it's also like you called me a dirty, sockless scumbag in your apology.
[13:07.220 --> 13:08.200]  I don't know how to feel about this.
[13:08.460 --> 13:10.820]  Yeah, I don't know how effective of like...
[13:10.820 --> 13:12.040]  I still think it's disgusting.
[13:12.280 --> 13:14.900]  I just am a part of, I'm just also disgusting.
[13:15.620 --> 13:19.100]  So wait, you, whenever you ride your bike, you don't wear socks.
[13:19.340 --> 13:21.680]  Uh, well, if I wear shorts, I don't wear socks.
[13:22.360 --> 13:23.680]  And so I had been wearing...
[13:23.680 --> 13:24.780]  This seems so complicated.
[13:24.820 --> 13:25.840]  It's not, it's not, it's not.
[13:25.920 --> 13:27.460]  If you wear pants, you wear socks.
[13:27.740 --> 13:29.000]  That's, that just makes sense.
[13:29.000 --> 13:29.240]  Okay.
[13:29.500 --> 13:29.720]  Right?
[13:30.080 --> 13:31.260]  Mostly you wear socks.
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.880]  But if it's a hundred degrees outside in Texas and you're riding a bicycle and you wear
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.300]  swim trunks, it looks dumb to wear swim trunks with socks, you know, and shoes.
[13:41.300 --> 13:46.080]  So you take the socks off and you just wear like, you know, gardening shoes, essentially.
[13:46.180 --> 13:48.660]  Why don't you just wear some low ankle socks?
[13:48.860 --> 13:50.420]  I can't wear those socks and I'll tell you why.
[13:50.800 --> 13:50.940]  Okay.
[13:51.400 --> 13:52.040]  Goddamn, dude.
[13:52.120 --> 13:54.380]  If I could, believe me, I wish that I could.
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.420]  However, I have very, I have very thin feet.
[13:59.920 --> 14:01.360]  That's, that's not a brag.
[14:01.920 --> 14:05.740]  It's just that my very thin, very long, thin feet.
[14:06.340 --> 14:09.200]  And so shoes are always a little too wide for me.
[14:09.460 --> 14:09.680]  Okay.
[14:09.760 --> 14:10.980]  So narrow, not like...
[14:11.500 --> 14:12.760]  Way for thin underneath.
[14:12.840 --> 14:13.460]  They're not way for thin.
[14:13.520 --> 14:13.860]  They're narrow.
[14:13.980 --> 14:14.820]  I have narrow feet.
[14:15.060 --> 14:18.180]  I have svelte, narrow, very thin ankles, very narrow feet.
[14:18.700 --> 14:20.020]  And so socks won't stay.
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.120]  The only socks that'll stay up are socks that are like long socks.
[14:23.380 --> 14:25.460]  So I can't wear those little short socks.
[14:25.660 --> 14:27.300]  I've had like runners versions.
[14:27.520 --> 14:28.320]  I've bought vans.
[14:28.640 --> 14:30.780]  I bought like a million different kinds of those little short socks.
[14:30.880 --> 14:34.580]  And what happens is when I put them on, even the ones that have the rubber stopper that
[14:34.580 --> 14:38.020]  are supposed to grab the back of your ankle or whatever, they, within five minutes, they're
[14:38.020 --> 14:39.800]  all bunched up in the front of the shoe.
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.340]  Surely it's nothing to do with the width of your foot.
[14:42.460 --> 14:45.260]  Like that's all ankle and heel that holds on a sock.
[14:45.660 --> 14:47.040]  No, it's, it's the whole package, dude.
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.040]  I don't fill out a sock.
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.900]  And then I, and then you walk around and then within 10 minutes, the socks are off and at
[14:54.900 --> 14:56.560]  the front of my shoes, squishing my feet.
[14:57.640 --> 14:58.600]  They go right off.
[14:59.900 --> 15:01.920]  I can't be the only person that has that problem.
[15:05.100 --> 15:09.040]  I mean, I don't, I feel like I don't have a wide foot either, but I don't, I'm not like
[15:09.040 --> 15:10.780]  that kicking my socks off when I run.
[15:12.120 --> 15:13.740]  Dude, I wish I wasn't.
[15:13.960 --> 15:15.640]  Maybe we should, here's what we do.
[15:15.780 --> 15:17.340]  He's like the worst force gump.
[15:17.780 --> 15:19.480]  His socks just falling as he's running.
[15:20.300 --> 15:23.220]  Next time we see each other, which hopefully won't be too long.
[15:23.340 --> 15:26.400]  Hopefully you'll be a big boy and buy a bicycle so we can go be friends again.
[15:26.560 --> 15:26.740]  Yeah.
[15:26.900 --> 15:31.300]  And, uh, I sent you two different, three different options, all perfectly lovely.
[15:31.760 --> 15:35.760]  Next time I see you, let's measure our feet and let's see whose feet are more narrow.
[15:36.580 --> 15:36.940]  Yeah.
[15:39.520 --> 15:42.100]  I mean, you can't, it's just a weird request.
[15:42.180 --> 15:46.120]  I'm convinced like, you know, you have those in like a fancy shoe.
[15:46.200 --> 15:50.360]  You'll have like a wooden foot bit that goes inside, keeps the shoe good.
[15:50.840 --> 15:51.620]  You know what I'm talking about?
[15:51.820 --> 15:52.440]  What, a shoe horn?
[15:52.900 --> 15:54.220]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:54.220 --> 15:57.060]  A shoe horn is like, is how you get in and out of a shoe.
[15:57.680 --> 15:59.080]  It's like in the toe.
[15:59.340 --> 16:00.960]  I don't know what it does, but yeah, I know what you mean.
[16:00.960 --> 16:07.380]  I've seen them as like a wooden toe section with like a metal bar leading to like a wooden heel.
[16:07.580 --> 16:10.020]  Oh, to maintain the shape of the shoe.
[16:10.200 --> 16:10.220]  Yeah.
[16:10.420 --> 16:10.580]  Yeah.
[16:10.800 --> 16:16.160]  I'm convinced if you put a sock on that, which is pretty much the narrowest foot of all time,
[16:16.440 --> 16:17.620]  I bet a sock would stay on that.
[16:17.880 --> 16:18.540]  I bet it wouldn't.
[16:18.660 --> 16:20.260]  I'm pretty sure the heel would keep it on.
[16:20.420 --> 16:22.400]  Not if it walked and rode a bicycle, it wouldn't.
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.120]  I promise you.
[16:24.620 --> 16:26.260]  There's nothing wrong with my heels, buddy.
[16:26.340 --> 16:27.560]  I got normal ass heels.
[16:27.800 --> 16:30.540]  I'm just telling you, socks don't stay up on these feet.
[16:30.540 --> 16:33.420]  Maybe your foot doesn't go back beyond your heel.
[16:33.840 --> 16:39.660]  I also have to, every pair of shoes I own, and part of why I own Vans is because they fit me a little bit better.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.360]  But I have to cinch like shoelaces as tight as they'll possibly go.
[16:44.560 --> 16:47.880]  And I still, my feet still slide around inside the shoe.
[16:48.080 --> 16:48.400]  Left to right.
[16:48.900 --> 16:50.640]  I think you're doing something wrong.
[16:51.200 --> 16:52.380]  Yeah, I have narrow feet.
[16:54.380 --> 16:55.660]  I always have.
[16:56.580 --> 16:59.420]  Should we put paint on our feet and stand on paper?
[16:59.420 --> 16:59.860]  Yes!
[17:01.660 --> 17:03.040]  Let's measure our feet.
[17:03.200 --> 17:04.160]  Let's get a tape measure.
[17:04.300 --> 17:05.240]  Let's measure our feet.
[17:05.540 --> 17:07.600]  Let's do sock studies, if you want.
[17:07.740 --> 17:08.800]  We'll both get the same socks.
[17:08.860 --> 17:12.440]  We can run around, do calisthenics, do physical activity, see whose socks stay on better.
[17:12.660 --> 17:16.620]  I guarantee you, you'll find my socks bunched up at the front of my fucking shoes for no reason.
[17:16.820 --> 17:20.720]  And it doesn't matter if it's Vans or Nikes or Adidas or whatever, or fucking dress shoes.
[17:20.740 --> 17:21.440]  It's all the same.
[17:21.660 --> 17:25.340]  Andrew, I feel like you're not a normal foot guy.
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.840]  I don't know what that means.
[17:27.020 --> 17:27.820]  What does that mean?
[17:27.820 --> 17:31.740]  You're just not like a blank guy.
[17:31.900 --> 17:34.700]  So I feel like there's something with your feet that you have an issue with.
[17:34.980 --> 17:36.420]  I mean, you got the bad ankles, obviously.
[17:36.640 --> 17:38.080]  Like, how is the rest of your foot looking?
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.960]  I don't feel like, yeah, I don't think I have any weird.
[17:42.080 --> 17:45.560]  But then there's like things where you don't know that are weird or not.
[17:45.880 --> 17:47.340]  I don't want to completely pivot away.
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.120]  But when you guys have a bath, this is somebody, somebody yelled at me about this.
[17:52.220 --> 17:55.780]  And I had never, I had never put any thought into this.
[17:55.940 --> 17:57.320]  I just, there's zero consideration.
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.880]  When you have a bath, do you fill the tub with any amount of water first and then hop in?
[18:03.120 --> 18:07.760]  Or do you just hop into the tub and then turn the water on and let it fill?
[18:09.060 --> 18:12.380]  I fill the bath and then I get in it once it's full.
[18:12.760 --> 18:16.900]  I do the same, but I do feel like you're being unfairly maligned here.
[18:17.040 --> 18:21.000]  I don't think it's that weird to get into an empty tub and fill it up.
[18:21.080 --> 18:24.140]  It feels like something you do when you're a kid more than an adult.
[18:24.140 --> 18:30.520]  But then you get all the weird, like sticky, like your skin will get all stuck to the side of the bath if there's no water in it.
[18:30.540 --> 18:32.900]  It's like not a great material to be naked against.
[18:33.400 --> 18:39.880]  Um, no, well, no, I don't, it's just, I never thought, I never even considered there was any other option.
[18:40.260 --> 18:42.600]  I climb into the tub while it's completely empty.
[18:45.760 --> 18:47.720]  This is apparently a weird thing.
[18:48.040 --> 18:49.160]  I did not know this.
[18:51.460 --> 18:54.960]  It's just a weird, it's just a weird way to spend your time, man.
[18:55.140 --> 18:59.960]  Like while that bath is running, you could be doing, you could be brushing your teeth or doing any, eating a cupcake.
[19:00.360 --> 19:01.300]  You could be doing anything else.
[19:01.400 --> 19:04.240]  Yeah, you could be mashing up your cupcakes, you could be collecting the headset.
[19:06.440 --> 19:08.920]  This is just like, for me, this is my logic.
[19:09.140 --> 19:11.820]  One, I get complete temperature control the entire way.
[19:12.140 --> 19:13.040]  I like a hot bath.
[19:13.460 --> 19:16.140]  So I'm, I'm, I'm gauging it the entire process.
[19:16.140 --> 19:20.360]  And then two, I don't trust that like the water, it's just going to overflow when I get in.
[19:20.480 --> 19:21.840]  I don't know what the cap is.
[19:22.160 --> 19:23.700]  I guess I'd learn that over time.
[19:24.020 --> 19:25.580]  I'm sure you just eventually figure that out.
[19:25.900 --> 19:27.060]  But when you get in, the water rises.
[19:27.320 --> 19:28.460]  Yeah, well, here's what you could do.
[19:28.940 --> 19:32.500]  Next time you have a bath, fill it up when you're in it, then get out.
[19:32.980 --> 19:35.440]  That's the amount of water you could put in before you get in.
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.620]  Or I could just hop in and then turn the water on and not think about it at all.
[19:39.860 --> 19:40.600]  I mean, you can.
[19:40.780 --> 19:44.940]  You could, it's just, A, it's boring to wait for a bath to fill.
[19:45.500 --> 19:47.980]  And if you're trying to like watch something or listen to something,
[19:48.100 --> 19:49.420]  you got the loud noise of all the water.
[19:49.640 --> 19:52.620]  You forgot, Gavin, I'm bringing in 50 devices with me.
[19:52.800 --> 19:53.300]  I'm not bored.
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.020]  I got a whole.
[19:55.240 --> 19:56.540]  Yeah, you're playing toilet Jenga.
[19:58.660 --> 20:01.680]  I just, I'd never considered that as being a strange thing.
[20:01.860 --> 20:05.480]  I did a Twitter poll and there's like 2000 votes right now.
[20:05.860 --> 20:07.540]  88% are filled before entering.
[20:07.940 --> 20:13.100]  And I feel like 90% of the 12% are people that click the wrong one by mistake.
[20:13.100 --> 20:14.960]  It feels like it's a very small minority.
[20:15.320 --> 20:16.120]  I'm open to it.
[20:16.160 --> 20:17.640]  Like, I'll try it for sure.
[20:17.800 --> 20:18.660]  I just never considered it.
[20:18.880 --> 20:20.320]  I want to, I want to enjoy the bath.
[20:20.440 --> 20:23.400]  I don't want to be doing all the fill work.
[20:23.420 --> 20:26.660]  But I would argue I'm enjoying more of the bath than you.
[20:26.760 --> 20:28.140]  I'm getting the full bath process.
[20:28.360 --> 20:28.740]  There's no way.
[20:29.020 --> 20:30.080]  Because he's not, he's not wrong.
[20:30.220 --> 20:33.860]  Once you're done doing the ratios and you're like, oh, this is a good temperature and it's full.
[20:34.200 --> 20:37.060]  You've been in the bath for probably like 5 or 10 minutes to that point.
[20:37.160 --> 20:38.180]  And you probably want to get out soon.
[20:38.500 --> 20:39.640]  Well, he's like pre-gaming though.
[20:39.720 --> 20:42.280]  That's like, that's like, yeah, that's that's tailgating.
[20:42.280 --> 20:45.320]  The bath hasn't started until the water turns off, right?
[20:45.420 --> 20:45.940]  It's pre-tubbing.
[20:46.060 --> 20:46.940]  It's exactly, Nick's got it right.
[20:47.000 --> 20:47.480]  It's pre-tubbing.
[20:48.740 --> 20:51.300]  That doesn't, pre-tubbing doesn't count against the bath.
[20:52.100 --> 20:53.740]  Yeah, but you don't want to get all wrinkled.
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.340]  How long are you staying in the bath, Andrew?
[20:56.580 --> 20:58.880]  For like the entirety of my bath on average?
[20:59.060 --> 21:01.040]  Probably like an hour, hour and a half, maybe?
[21:01.140 --> 21:01.900]  Hour and a half.
[21:02.100 --> 21:04.540]  What are you watching a full fucking movie in there?
[21:04.760 --> 21:05.700]  Yeah, I might be.
[21:05.960 --> 21:06.720]  Yeah, hour and a half.
[21:07.160 --> 21:09.340]  If you're an hour and a half in a bathtub,
[21:09.340 --> 21:13.380]  you're having to empty out water and then refill it to keep a constant temperature.
[21:13.780 --> 21:14.740]  Well, that's the problem.
[21:15.180 --> 21:19.560]  If I could have like a random ability, it would be like water hot, like as a command.
[21:19.820 --> 21:23.320]  I'm really bad at, even though I'm in the tub before the water gets in there,
[21:23.560 --> 21:26.940]  I am the absolute worst at gauging what temperature I want.
[21:27.220 --> 21:29.320]  I want it to be super hot, but then I get too hot.
[21:29.380 --> 21:33.260]  So I put cold in and it gets too cold and I can never get back to the hotness I want.
[21:33.400 --> 21:34.160]  It's a struggle.
[21:34.260 --> 21:35.080]  I'm really bad at maintaining.
[21:35.080 --> 21:37.320]  Do you have like rationed hot water?
[21:38.140 --> 21:38.880]  What do you mean?
[21:38.880 --> 21:40.520]  What do you mean by rationed hot water?
[21:40.680 --> 21:41.780]  Like I have a limited tank.
[21:42.120 --> 21:42.540]  That's what you mean.
[21:42.540 --> 21:45.940]  Yeah, like in England, the heater came on like twice a day.
[21:46.020 --> 21:49.080]  And if you used up all the hot water in the morning, that was it until it came on at night.
[21:49.540 --> 21:51.820]  Yeah, I don't know exactly what the recharge is.
[21:51.880 --> 21:53.440]  But yeah, you run out of hot water.
[21:53.660 --> 21:55.100]  And is that why you can't get it hot again?
[21:55.160 --> 21:55.680]  Or you just...
[21:55.680 --> 21:58.900]  Yeah, that is the problem of like, yeah, like I get it super hot.
[21:59.020 --> 22:01.540]  I kind of want it to be soup like, but then it gets a little too hot.
[22:01.600 --> 22:04.680]  So I put cold in and then like I've already used too much of my cap.
[22:04.740 --> 22:05.640]  So I can't get it back.
[22:05.960 --> 22:06.620]  It's a problem.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.220]  Here's what I did.
[22:07.260 --> 22:08.200]  I feel like this is much easier.
[22:08.200 --> 22:09.880]  I'll run a bath, right?
[22:10.020 --> 22:10.660]  All the way to the top.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.960]  Maybe a couple of inches lower than the drain thing at the top because I'll displace a few.
[22:15.400 --> 22:17.540]  If it's too hot, dip a dip a little foot in.
[22:17.640 --> 22:18.820]  If it's too hot, just wait a bit.
[22:19.320 --> 22:23.180]  I'm not adding cold to it because that because that will really throw it cold too quickly.
[22:23.520 --> 22:25.180]  OK, that's good advice.
[22:25.240 --> 22:28.700]  I was just curious because it never it was a thing I never considered.
[22:28.900 --> 22:32.000]  And when I told the cupcake thing, I mentioned it and someone yelled at me about it.
[22:32.140 --> 22:35.700]  I don't think it's as weird as the audience has latched on to.
[22:35.820 --> 22:36.720]  I got to be honest with you.
[22:36.740 --> 22:38.060]  And I do think I've done it that way.
[22:38.060 --> 22:43.280]  I do think the way Gavin is describing it is the is the way most the vast majority of
[22:43.280 --> 22:44.280]  people take baths.
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.860]  Although I Gavin's fear of adding cold water and for fucking up the ratio is weird.
[22:48.960 --> 22:49.860]  I don't know why you wouldn't do that.
[22:49.980 --> 22:51.260]  It's not it's not hard.
[22:51.560 --> 22:52.940]  I just I don't want the back and forth.
[22:53.700 --> 22:54.920]  Let me ask you a question, Andrew.
[22:55.240 --> 22:57.880]  How many how many baths on average?
[22:57.980 --> 22:59.320]  How many baths a week do you take?
[22:59.760 --> 23:00.520]  Uh, I don't know.
[23:00.560 --> 23:01.600]  Maybe two, two or three.
[23:01.620 --> 23:02.800]  Is a bath your like?
[23:02.880 --> 23:04.040]  Are you more of a shower guy?
[23:04.220 --> 23:05.580]  No, no, I'm more of a shower.
[23:05.580 --> 23:08.680]  Yeah, I'm a bath is purely a relaxation.
[23:09.020 --> 23:13.760]  Yeah, I only take baths when my girlfriend makes me because I'm whining about how sore
[23:13.760 --> 23:14.900]  my shoulder is or whatever.
[23:15.080 --> 23:16.640]  And she's like, take a bath with Epsom salts.
[23:16.800 --> 23:19.140]  So I don't ever think to take a bath.
[23:19.640 --> 23:23.220]  It's something that's thrust upon me that I then have to acquiesce to.
[23:23.840 --> 23:25.020]  How often do you take baths, Gavin?
[23:25.440 --> 23:31.540]  I'm a pretty frequent bather these days because when I lived with you in my little studio,
[23:31.580 --> 23:32.240]  I didn't have one.
[23:32.240 --> 23:36.220]  And then when we lived in that rental house, did that house have one?
[23:36.380 --> 23:36.700]  I don't think.
[23:36.920 --> 23:36.940]  No.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.320]  I think you had one, but I didn't.
[23:38.460 --> 23:40.640]  Yeah, you've been shower-centric.
[23:40.680 --> 23:42.560]  Yeah, so I was just a shower dude for years.
[23:42.640 --> 23:45.660]  And then when I finally got my own house, I was all about a bath.
[23:45.760 --> 23:46.160]  I love them.
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.340]  Good relaxing time.
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.480]  Good time to do emails and that.
[23:49.560 --> 23:50.960]  Watch something you've been putting off.
[23:51.160 --> 23:51.680]  I love it.
[23:51.940 --> 23:53.020]  Yeah, it's a great...
[23:53.020 --> 23:54.180]  Here's the other thing with my bath.
[23:54.260 --> 23:55.980]  Why I don't think I can even...
[23:55.980 --> 23:59.980]  Even let's say I agree the better method is to fill it to an extent or whatever and check it.
[23:59.980 --> 24:03.380]  My bathtub really fucking sucks where I live.
[24:03.480 --> 24:06.840]  It's very narrow.
[24:07.400 --> 24:08.540]  It's like surprisingly narrow.
[24:08.760 --> 24:10.420]  It's like if Geoff's foot was about to...
[24:10.420 --> 24:12.480]  Yeah, I bet it couldn't hold up a sock.
[24:12.720 --> 24:15.080]  Yeah, it definitely couldn't hold up a sock.
[24:15.260 --> 24:16.780]  Audience is going to back me up on this.
[24:16.840 --> 24:19.660]  There's a lot of people out there that have sock issues like me, I promise you.
[24:20.820 --> 24:23.180]  So I need to, for how this tub is shaped,
[24:23.640 --> 24:26.520]  I need to hold my back to the wall the entire time of it.
[24:26.580 --> 24:29.180]  It's a tub shower because if I don't...
[24:29.180 --> 24:30.260]  What did you...
[24:30.260 --> 24:31.240]  What do you mean? Go ahead.
[24:31.380 --> 24:33.320]  What did you just say? Do that bit again.
[24:33.580 --> 24:33.800]  Yeah.
[24:34.060 --> 24:35.000]  I don't understand.
[24:35.700 --> 24:38.540]  I was trying to picture it. I don't know what you said.
[24:38.900 --> 24:42.100]  Okay, it's a tub shower. It's weirdly shaped. It's very narrow.
[24:42.420 --> 24:43.300]  But it is a bath.
[24:43.580 --> 24:46.940]  Yeah, it's a bath like there's a bath and there's a shower part to it.
[24:47.000 --> 24:47.180]  Yeah.
[24:47.240 --> 24:50.820]  But it's like, it's just like you have a curtain instead of a door, whatever. It's both.
[24:50.860 --> 24:53.000]  You're describing like every...
[24:53.000 --> 24:53.780]  Describing a bath.
[24:54.020 --> 24:54.220]  Yeah.
[24:54.480 --> 24:58.120]  Well, there are bathtubs that don't have shower attachments. But yeah, I guess you're right.
[24:58.120 --> 25:00.480]  It's a little redundant to get into the specifics of it.
[25:00.860 --> 25:08.020]  But the point is mainly the shape issue. If I slide off that back wall, water gets behind me
[25:08.020 --> 25:12.360]  and then I can't go backwards or else it fires out the back of the tub and gets all over the floor.
[25:12.380 --> 25:13.260]  You've lost me again.
[25:13.900 --> 25:16.680]  You're acting as a dam for your own bathtub.
[25:17.060 --> 25:24.420]  Yeah, like I need to hold the wall, the back wall of the tub or it will get behind me.
[25:24.420 --> 25:29.100]  And if it's like a fucking, it's like in a movie where they step on the trip mine or whatever,
[25:29.240 --> 25:32.920]  like I need to, I can't move a certain extent or else it will fire out the tub.
[25:33.080 --> 25:34.760]  Is there a perfect seal?
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.800]  Andrew's fucking Hodor fighting off the water walkers.
[25:37.980 --> 25:42.440]  I am. I am. Yeah. I just, I cannot allow water.
[25:42.600 --> 25:43.260]  He's Hobar.
[25:45.560 --> 25:51.200]  It's, I am the fucking Gandalf of water of like, it cannot pass me because if it does,
[25:51.440 --> 25:53.100]  it's going to get all over the floor.
[25:53.100 --> 25:57.280]  Wait, I'm imagining it all wrong.
[25:57.420 --> 26:00.900]  I'm imagining that you just sat in the middle of the path and there's only water in front of you.
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:02.200 --> 26:04.060]  You say your back is at the wall.
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.220]  My back is at the wall of the tub at the very, like as far back as it could get.
[26:08.320 --> 26:09.800]  You're creating a skin seal.
[26:10.160 --> 26:12.780]  Yeah. I'm blocking it off. So all the water goes in front of me.
[26:12.980 --> 26:18.040]  Right. But if the water gets behind you, you can't just slowly sit back against the wall.
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.960]  If I, if I slowly go back against the wall, the water shoots out of the back.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.060]  It's like a cork in a bottle.
[26:29.440 --> 26:30.780]  That's a great descriptor.
[26:31.520 --> 26:34.180]  The first, I didn't, I didn't realize this.
[26:34.400 --> 26:39.080]  I didn't realize this the first time I was here and I got out of the tub and my floor was drenched.
[26:39.500 --> 26:41.180]  Just water all over.
[26:41.260 --> 26:43.500]  Someone coming up and be like, Andrew, why is there water on the ceiling?
[26:43.860 --> 26:47.260]  It doesn't fire that right.
[26:47.260 --> 26:49.140]  It's just slightly goes over.
[26:51.600 --> 26:53.220]  It's not like launching water.
[26:53.440 --> 26:53.900]  So what do you say?
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.340]  Are you just saying the back of the tub or is there a wall at the back of the tub also?
[26:59.520 --> 27:02.100]  I don't, maybe I'll just take a photo of it.
[27:02.180 --> 27:04.180]  Like, it's just, it's all one piece.
[27:04.220 --> 27:06.680]  Like the shower plastic to the tub is all one piece.
[27:06.720 --> 27:07.860]  Could you take a photo now?
[27:09.080 --> 27:09.880]  Uh, sure.
[27:09.880 --> 27:18.300]  Uh, well, while he's taking a photo, uh, well, he's off.
[27:19.020 --> 27:23.080]  Do you remember the, the fucking Don Zimmer, Pedro Martinez fight, Gavin?
[27:23.300 --> 27:23.500]  Yeah.
[27:23.720 --> 27:27.920]  Did we look at the, did we do the action images of that or just the image of him getting,
[27:28.300 --> 27:29.580]  did we show all the images?
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.760]  I made a little flip book that I've been going through it.
[27:31.920 --> 27:35.700]  Oh no, I mean, we watched the, we looked at that one picture with the hat being pushed
[27:35.700 --> 27:37.880]  in his eyes and then, and then we watched the clip.
[27:38.080 --> 27:39.860]  See if I can add all three of these.
[27:39.860 --> 27:42.100]  I've been bouncing back and forth between the three of them all day.
[27:42.300 --> 27:44.400]  And I've been laughing so fucking hard.
[27:44.840 --> 27:47.740]  I was looking them up for an, for an idea I have for an image.
[27:47.740 --> 27:51.600]  And then, uh, and then I noticed that I don't think I had ever seen.
[27:52.440 --> 27:55.860]  I've never seen the stills from this angle.
[27:56.240 --> 27:57.380]  I've seen the, the hat one.
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.400]  It's just amazing.
[27:59.400 --> 28:02.440]  The one with his just, it looks like he's dead on the ground.
[28:02.700 --> 28:04.180]  I'm waiting for the third one to load.
[28:04.400 --> 28:04.860]  Oh, okay.
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.380]  You haven't seen it.
[28:05.400 --> 28:05.880]  It's the best.
[28:05.880 --> 28:10.200]  Oh, yes.
[28:13.080 --> 28:14.080]  Thank you, Geoff.
[28:14.320 --> 28:19.640]  Andrew, I was telling, I was filling time and I was telling Gav that I, uh, oh yes.
[28:19.720 --> 28:23.960]  I was looking at pictures of Zimmer and Pedro fighting today for a project that I want to do.
[28:24.100 --> 28:27.980]  I was, I could talk about, but I was talking about with Andrew earlier and I realized that
[28:27.980 --> 28:31.700]  there were some awesome action photos and I made like a little flip book on my, on my,
[28:31.700 --> 28:36.660]  on my Apple where I just like write, I write trigger between them and just watch them fall.
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.040]  That's gotta be a gift.
[28:38.420 --> 28:45.020]  But that last one, you could Photoshop a red, a red rag into that guy's hand and it would be amazing.
[28:47.020 --> 28:48.160]  It would be amazing.
[28:49.100 --> 28:52.840]  I was, I was at, this is, this is like walking back to Christmas.
[28:52.840 --> 28:54.760]  I was asking Geoff about this earlier.
[28:54.880 --> 28:56.460]  He sent me like the one we've all seen.
[28:56.500 --> 28:59.680]  And I'm like, is, do you think there's a photographer that has like in the process
[28:59.680 --> 29:02.000]  of fall? Because I want to see him right before impact.
[29:02.200 --> 29:03.540]  I want to see him on impact.
[29:03.920 --> 29:04.540]  This is great.
[29:04.860 --> 29:04.960]  Yeah.
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.320]  The last one looks like his heart stopped, like on that frame.
[29:10.780 --> 29:12.560]  I had an idea this morning, Gavin.
[29:12.800 --> 29:14.040]  I think it's okay to talk about it.
[29:14.120 --> 29:16.600]  If it's, if, if, if you're hearing this, then we didn't cut it.
[29:16.660 --> 29:19.000]  If you're not hearing it, we cut it and you don't even know that we talked about it.
[29:19.220 --> 29:23.400]  But I had an idea this morning, Gavin, where, uh, I was telling Andrew, I showed it to him.
[29:23.460 --> 29:27.480]  You know how they make mosaic images out of smaller versions of the same thing?
[29:27.540 --> 29:27.840]  Yeah.
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.700]  So I was thinking we could, it would be funny to make a giant mosaic art piece
[29:32.700 --> 29:36.560]  of Don and Pedro fighting called the Don Pedro project,
[29:36.800 --> 29:39.320]  but it's made out of baseball cards of Don and Pedro.
[29:39.640 --> 29:40.640]  Oh, it's phenomenal.
[29:40.800 --> 29:42.720]  And so I found a program online that'll do it.
[29:42.760 --> 29:46.620]  And I counted up, I need, I found, I just need to collect cards now.
[29:46.740 --> 29:50.520]  It's going to be about 2030 cards, I think is what it would take to make it.
[29:50.580 --> 29:53.800]  And so I just need like probably about 15 different Pedro and Don cards,
[29:53.860 --> 29:55.280]  and then just hundreds of them.
[29:55.280 --> 29:58.220]  And then I can, I can actually physically make this thing and put it together.
[29:58.280 --> 30:02.640]  And it'd be like a giant, probably like 2000 baseball card mosaic of them fighting.
[30:02.880 --> 30:04.860]  We could auction that. That'd be amazing for charity.
[30:05.040 --> 30:07.040]  I was telling Andrew, it belongs in a museum.
[30:07.220 --> 30:09.040]  I mean, it's not, it doesn't exist yet, but it does.
[30:09.420 --> 30:10.880]  That would be a great Instagram post too,
[30:10.960 --> 30:13.000]  just being able to swipe between all three of those.
[30:13.260 --> 30:13.700]  That's phenomenal.
[30:14.120 --> 30:15.840]  Absolutely. Yeah, that's what, that's all I've been doing at home
[30:15.840 --> 30:17.740]  since I've had that conversation with Andrew, I've been swiping through them.
[30:19.020 --> 30:21.080]  That is a weird fucking tub, Andrew.
[30:21.080 --> 30:26.480]  I have never, never in my life seen that tub configuration.
[30:26.800 --> 30:30.300]  The water is directly behind the back of the tub.
[30:30.420 --> 30:32.640]  That looks like a nice tub. That looks pretty fancy.
[30:32.760 --> 30:35.620]  No, it's a shit tub. It is awful.
[30:36.020 --> 30:39.340]  It stinks. It's like a decent shower, awful tub.
[30:39.500 --> 30:40.120]  I see what you mean.
[30:40.120 --> 30:43.140]  Really tall, like no space. It's very tight.
[30:43.280 --> 30:47.480]  So does that mean most of the time in the bath, you have a dry back?
[30:47.840 --> 30:49.200]  Yeah. Yeah, it does.
[30:49.200 --> 30:52.260]  But well, no, typically, you know what? I try my best. I'm not perfect.
[30:52.400 --> 30:55.000]  I'll eventually slide off that wall and then I have a problem.
[30:55.800 --> 30:59.320]  I imagine it, I imagine it probably takes a lot of strength in your legs
[30:59.320 --> 31:03.860]  to maintain that position because yeah, eventually I slide down,
[31:03.920 --> 31:05.660]  especially if I'm having like a bubble bath,
[31:05.740 --> 31:08.660]  you get some slipperiness to the sides of the tub. It becomes difficult.
[31:08.900 --> 31:12.760]  I just can't imagine you getting in that and sitting down naked with no water in.
[31:12.940 --> 31:14.940]  It's just such a weird mental image.
[31:15.400 --> 31:21.020]  It's just like staring at your dick as it slowly starts to float as the water rushes.
[31:24.400 --> 31:28.000]  So is that something you learned as a kid? Like were you bathed?
[31:28.020 --> 31:29.760]  I don't think you learned it as an adult, Gavin.
[31:30.260 --> 31:36.660]  I don't... I don't know. I never put any thought into it. It's just like how I've had a bath.
[31:36.800 --> 31:39.540]  You also said in the last episode that you filled the tub up halfway.
[31:40.000 --> 31:40.640]  What do you mean?
[31:40.920 --> 31:42.520]  When you were describing getting in, you were like,
[31:42.520 --> 31:43.980]  I got in, I filled the tub up halfway.
[31:45.300 --> 31:49.480]  So no, I guess what I would have meant by that is I hopped in the tub and the water was about halfway.
[31:50.060 --> 31:54.320]  So I felt ready to... I got into it empty, but when the water was halfway, I was like,
[31:54.360 --> 31:55.900]  okay, now I can start moving stuff over.
[31:55.980 --> 31:56.300]  Got it.
[31:56.340 --> 31:57.140]  Like I feel good.
[31:57.160 --> 32:00.360]  Now you were, you were, you decided halfway was enough to initiate bath.
[32:00.600 --> 32:02.500]  Yes. That was like, I'm going to start moving things.
[32:02.840 --> 32:05.520]  But also if you like a nice hot steamy bath,
[32:05.960 --> 32:11.180]  I can't imagine trying to wear an over the ear Xbox headset. I must get just sweaty as hell.
[32:11.180 --> 32:12.640]  I don't do it often.
[32:13.680 --> 32:16.140]  This episode is brought to you by Buffalo Trace Distillery.

[33:36.920 --> 33:38.120]  Chipotle. For real.
[33:39.120 --> 33:43.040]  It's a very rare case that was like maybe the second time I've ever done it.
[33:43.060 --> 33:48.240]  In my bathing career, it was an experiment that will not be pursued.
[33:48.960 --> 33:52.500]  Now there's like shit all over the ear pieces.
[33:53.840 --> 33:56.640]  No, no, it's good. We're all good.
[34:01.530 --> 34:05.350]  This episode of F*** Face is brought to you by the Jordan Harbinger Show.
[34:05.710 --> 34:07.490]  Want a new podcast to look forward to each week?
[34:07.590 --> 34:08.550]  Other than this one?
[34:08.690 --> 34:10.690]  One that's entertaining, like this one isn't.
[34:10.690 --> 34:12.730]  Informative? This one definitely isn't.
[34:12.830 --> 34:14.270]  And packed with actionable content?
[34:14.670 --> 34:15.210]  Of course you do.
[34:15.570 --> 34:18.150]  The average podcast listener has six shows in rotation.
[34:18.450 --> 34:21.030]  So you're most likely not just listening to F*** Face.
[34:21.290 --> 34:22.110]  And that's totally okay.
[34:22.350 --> 34:25.730]  In fact, I'd love to share a podcast to add to your list.
[34:26.110 --> 34:29.930]  The Jordan Harbinger Show was named a Best of Apple in 2018 podcast.
[34:30.230 --> 34:31.570]  So don't just ignore my suggestion.
[34:31.830 --> 34:32.350]  Give it a try.

[34:38.650 --> 34:43.730]  mobsters, spies, hostage negotiators, etc, etc.
[34:44.350 --> 34:48.730]  He has an undeniable talent for getting his guests to share never-before-heard stories
[34:48.730 --> 34:49.950]  and thought-provoking insights.
[34:50.090 --> 34:53.370]  And without fail, he puts out tactical bits of wisdom in each episode.
[34:53.590 --> 34:56.350]  All with the noble cause to make you a little more informed,
[34:56.650 --> 34:59.250]  a critical thinker, to better operate in today's world.
[34:59.650 --> 35:03.530]  Not to mention, Jordan has one of the most highly rated self-development shows out right now.
[35:03.790 --> 35:07.410]  And after the last year we've had, I think we can all agree self-development is pretty important.
[35:07.410 --> 35:10.710]  You can't go wrong with adding the Jordan Harbinger Show to your rotation.
[35:10.930 --> 35:11.890]  It's incredibly interesting.
[35:12.290 --> 35:13.590]  There's never a dull show.
[35:13.910 --> 35:15.430]  Search for the Jordan Harbinger Show.
[35:15.490 --> 35:17.090]  That's H-A-R-B as in boy.
[35:17.270 --> 35:18.990]  I-N as in Nancy.
[35:19.290 --> 35:21.490]  G-E-R as in Gir.
[35:21.850 --> 35:26.090]  On Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.
[35:26.810 --> 35:28.130]  So Mother's Day is coming up.
[35:28.570 --> 35:31.170]  Are you a last-minute Mother's Day shopper like I am?
[35:31.530 --> 35:33.470]  Well, Tushy's got you covered.
[35:33.790 --> 35:34.450]  Think about it.
[35:34.730 --> 35:36.790]  Your mother, she wiped your ass for years.
[35:36.790 --> 35:39.070]  Probably three or so.
[35:39.350 --> 35:40.850]  If it was, it could have been longer.
[35:41.070 --> 35:42.750]  I don't know how things are done in your family.
[35:43.570 --> 35:47.210]  And also, you know, maybe that's normal where you live.
[35:47.250 --> 35:47.570]  I don't know.
[35:47.970 --> 35:53.030]  However, I think it's time to return the favor with the perfect gift for Mother's Day from Hello Tushy.
[35:53.290 --> 35:59.230]  Let's drag your mom into the future with the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 Modern Bidet Attachment.
[35:59.370 --> 35:59.930]  It's stylish.
[36:00.150 --> 36:00.810]  It's eco-friendly.
[36:00.990 --> 36:02.250]  It's easy to install.
[36:02.250 --> 36:07.930]  And it will help stop flushing her retirement down the toilet in toilet paper costs.
[36:08.410 --> 36:12.390]  Moms are usually on fixed incomes when they retire, as are dads.
[36:12.450 --> 36:13.590]  But we're not talking about Dad right now.
[36:13.670 --> 36:14.090]  His day.
[36:14.830 --> 36:16.010]  This is not about him.
[36:16.310 --> 36:17.030]  This is Mom's Day.
[36:17.330 --> 36:18.950]  And we want to save Mom money.
[36:19.250 --> 36:24.170]  You ate up all of her money when you were a voraciously never-full teenager, right?
[36:24.590 --> 36:29.110]  You spent all her gas driving to and from the mall and back, or God knows where.
[36:29.630 --> 36:30.590]  Help the woman safe.
[36:30.930 --> 36:31.970]  Save in toilet paper costs.
[36:31.970 --> 36:36.510]  She can save up to 80% of toilet paper costs with the Hello Tushy 3.0.
[36:36.770 --> 36:40.290]  Not only does it help her save money, but it cleans butts like a champ.
[36:40.410 --> 36:45.090]  Like she cleaned your butt, it'll do the same for her without having to get weird with it.
[36:45.410 --> 36:46.710]  And it doesn't stop there.
[36:46.890 --> 36:51.030]  Not only does it clean your mom's butt, it cleans itself with the Smart Spray Automatic
[36:51.030 --> 36:52.010]  Self-Cleaning Nozzle.
[36:52.470 --> 36:53.890]  So give the gift of a clean butt.

[37:08.710 --> 37:14.150]  Speaking of Xbox Live headsets, my fucking daughter started playing Rainbow Six Siege
[37:14.150 --> 37:14.430]  again.
[37:15.130 --> 37:18.870]  And in an effort to spend time with her and connect with her, I've started playing too.
[37:19.450 --> 37:22.950]  And she has, and it's been nice, we've been bonding through it, but she has started to
[37:22.950 --> 37:30.590]  compile a list of video clips of me panicking and freaking out and losing games for the
[37:30.590 --> 37:30.930]  team.
[37:31.530 --> 37:37.050]  And she's very quickly amassed a very large amount of clips.
[37:37.170 --> 37:38.090]  It's fucking annoying.
[37:38.590 --> 37:40.190]  And she loves to show them to me.
[37:40.470 --> 37:41.890]  She loves to go, hey dad, remember when you did this?
[37:41.950 --> 37:42.690]  And it's like, ugh.
[37:45.930 --> 37:47.050]  I don't know, you'd have to ask her.
[37:48.150 --> 37:51.750]  You don't want to see me be, you saw me be bad at video games for like 15 years.
[37:51.830 --> 37:52.410]  You don't need to see it.
[37:52.410 --> 37:53.270]  It's brutal.
[37:53.650 --> 37:54.230]  It's brutal.
[37:54.470 --> 37:56.250]  It's like a dude walks into a room, I go, ah!
[37:56.590 --> 37:59.970]  And I shoot everything around him, and then he turns around and looks at me and walks
[37:59.970 --> 38:00.550]  over and stabs me.
[38:00.590 --> 38:01.570]  Shit like that, you know?
[38:02.410 --> 38:05.610]  Just like, lost my ability, lost all my hand-eye coordination.
[38:06.090 --> 38:06.450]  Pure panic.
[38:06.450 --> 38:07.650]  What game are you worst at, do you think?
[38:09.470 --> 38:09.790]  Halo.
[38:10.470 --> 38:11.230]  I suck at Halo.
[38:11.610 --> 38:14.510]  Yeah, for as much time as I've spent on it, I really suck at it.
[38:15.050 --> 38:16.590]  I don't know, I'm pretty bad at a lot of stuff.
[38:17.170 --> 38:17.850]  It's hard to pick.
[38:18.430 --> 38:20.010]  I feel like you hate TTT.
[38:20.690 --> 38:23.370]  Oh, I'm not great at any of the Gmod games.
[38:23.470 --> 38:24.570]  I'm not great at any GT.
[38:24.730 --> 38:26.770]  I'm not good at a lot.
[38:28.610 --> 38:30.070]  But you're right, I definitely...
[38:30.070 --> 38:33.710]  I get confused by all the rules in all your Gmod games.
[38:33.830 --> 38:36.810]  They got way too complicated after I left Achievement Hunter, and I don't understand
[38:36.810 --> 38:37.250]  it all now.
[38:37.570 --> 38:39.310]  It's like you gotta be a fucking scientist.
[38:39.530 --> 38:42.190]  It always sucks when you miss the beginning of something.
[38:42.310 --> 38:44.010]  It's hard to get involved.
[38:44.370 --> 38:47.210]  I mean, it takes a couple of games to get used to what the hell's going on in there.
[38:47.210 --> 38:51.590]  Did you, speaking of, did you see that easter egg that they posted today in the Slack of
[38:51.590 --> 38:54.850]  that Halo, like, warthog race thing?
[38:55.270 --> 38:55.450]  Nah.
[38:55.890 --> 39:01.850]  There was an easter egg hidden in Halo 5 on the evacuation level, I believe it is.
[39:01.890 --> 39:05.270]  I think it's like the second or third level, where it's a timed event, and if you get to
[39:05.270 --> 39:09.450]  a certain spot, it initiates an easter egg where it puts everybody on warthogs, or on
[39:09.910 --> 39:14.330]  mongoose, and you just do a mongoose race to the end of the map with no enemies, or to
[39:14.330 --> 39:15.230]  the end of a part of the map.
[39:15.230 --> 39:18.750]  And then when you get there, the person who wins the race gets heavy weapons for the rest
[39:18.750 --> 39:19.430]  of the level.
[39:19.990 --> 39:24.510]  And it was six years old, and nobody ever found it, and so just recently, the guy who
[39:24.510 --> 39:26.690]  was the level designer leaked it and was like, hey, check it out.
[39:26.910 --> 39:29.050]  There's a video of it in our Slack, it's really interesting.
[39:29.490 --> 39:32.310]  Brand new Halo easter egg that's a four-player co-op, pretty cool.
[39:32.590 --> 39:35.590]  I wonder what the most elaborate easter egg is that hasn't been found.
[39:36.010 --> 39:40.990]  There was that easter egg in that Batman game, where, that first Batman game that nobody
[39:40.990 --> 39:44.110]  found for like two years, where you had to break into that room.
[39:44.110 --> 39:46.130]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[39:46.450 --> 39:47.170]  Those are cool.
[39:47.570 --> 39:50.610]  I wonder how many of those are undiscovered, just generally speaking.
[39:50.630 --> 39:51.310]  I bet a lot.
[39:51.330 --> 39:51.990]  Most of them get found.
[39:52.310 --> 39:52.810]  You think so?
[39:52.970 --> 39:53.930]  I bet there's a ton out there.
[39:54.070 --> 39:54.190]  Yeah.
[39:54.930 --> 39:57.930]  And then also, define what is elaborate.
[39:58.650 --> 40:02.210]  I don't know if you know this, Gavin, I just learned, I played, you and I talked about
[40:02.210 --> 40:03.170]  how much we love Hitman.
[40:03.570 --> 40:06.810]  I love Hitman Blood Money, one of the games I've played the most of.
[40:07.110 --> 40:09.950]  Played endless amounts of hours into it.
[40:10.210 --> 40:12.830]  I didn't know that, you know the wedding level or whatever?
[40:12.830 --> 40:14.770]  You go to a southern wedding.
[40:15.290 --> 40:16.870]  Yeah, with the chandelier and stuff.
[40:17.110 --> 40:21.910]  Yeah, I recently learned within the last year that there's a little button on the ground
[40:21.910 --> 40:22.910]  that you can shoot.
[40:23.050 --> 40:27.630]  And if you shoot, then 20 naked guys, just in their underwear, run at you and do a whole
[40:27.630 --> 40:28.310]  dance sequence.
[40:28.750 --> 40:29.690]  And then they just walk away.
[40:29.930 --> 40:32.070]  Yeah, I think I've seen a clip from that.
[40:32.470 --> 40:34.250]  I think it was in a speedrun.
[40:34.330 --> 40:37.610]  It was at a GDQ of some sort, where someone showed that off.
[40:37.610 --> 40:39.790]  You know what's even better than Easter eggs?
[40:39.970 --> 40:43.710]  Is just when you miss a fucking mechanic of the game and don't know it exists.
[40:44.610 --> 40:47.710]  Gavin and I were talking about like what Hitman is.
[40:48.570 --> 40:51.490]  Hitman is a fascinating series because they haven't innovated a lot.
[40:51.870 --> 40:56.950]  I feel like if anything, they've kind of removed features over time and it has created improvements.
[40:57.470 --> 41:00.030]  And we're talking about what is the best thing they added.
[41:00.110 --> 41:02.150]  And Gavin said the ability to throw items.
[41:02.670 --> 41:04.370]  And I said, well, that's been around.
[41:04.530 --> 41:06.090]  And he said, it's been in since Absolution.
[41:06.210 --> 41:07.570]  I said, no, it's been in since Blood Money.
[41:08.030 --> 41:10.870]  Gavin, I taught Gavin that you can throw things in Blood Money.
[41:10.950 --> 41:11.550]  He refused.
[41:11.670 --> 41:12.110]  He didn't know.
[41:12.290 --> 41:15.850]  How many hours have you put in the Blood Money, Gavin, without realizing you could throw?
[41:16.370 --> 41:17.930]  Well, I knew you could throw a coin.
[41:18.330 --> 41:19.150]  I don't know if I...
[41:20.230 --> 41:24.390]  Because in Absolution onwards, you hold down left trigger and you just get a target.
[41:24.510 --> 41:27.670]  It's a guaranteed 100% accurate throw into someone's head.
[41:27.850 --> 41:28.030]  Yeah.
[41:28.210 --> 41:32.450]  So to me, that was a thing they added that I think would be a real struggle if they took out.
[41:32.890 --> 41:35.290]  But it's more manual in Blood Money, isn't it?
[41:35.290 --> 41:36.110]  I don't think I ever tried it.
[41:36.130 --> 41:36.550]  It is.
[41:36.930 --> 41:37.390]  No, it is.
[41:37.390 --> 41:39.010]  You had no idea it existed.
[41:39.150 --> 41:40.790]  Yeah, I don't think I knew you could throw.
[41:41.310 --> 41:42.170]  I was blown away.
[41:42.350 --> 41:45.010]  I would have bet thousands on that.
[41:45.630 --> 41:47.870]  Was it covered in a tutorial, Andrew?
[41:48.230 --> 41:49.670]  Yeah, it's in the beginning of the game.
[41:49.730 --> 41:50.250]  They teach you.
[41:50.470 --> 41:51.270]  There's a line about it.
[41:51.750 --> 41:53.310]  But I had missed it too, to be fair to him.
[41:53.310 --> 41:55.450]  I think that happens way commonly.
[41:55.630 --> 42:00.710]  I remember Bernie, he was like 40 hours into Fallout 3 when he discovered V.A.T.S.
[42:01.110 --> 42:02.690]  He was just like aiming and shit.
[42:02.810 --> 42:05.010]  And I beat Crackdown without auto-aim.
[42:05.190 --> 42:05.650]  I didn't even know...
[42:06.090 --> 42:07.450]  That's an absurd thing.
[42:07.670 --> 42:09.070]  That's way worse than the V.A.T.S.
[42:09.590 --> 42:10.530]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[42:10.830 --> 42:12.590]  I feel like that happens a lot.
[42:12.770 --> 42:17.170]  They throw so much information at you early on in video games now that it is very easy,
[42:17.310 --> 42:19.370]  if you're not paying attention, to miss one mechanic.
[42:19.790 --> 42:21.510]  And they don't ever touch on it again.
[42:21.750 --> 42:23.330]  I feel like that happens to me all the time.
[42:23.430 --> 42:26.050]  Yeah, I think the last time it happened to me was Sekiro.
[42:26.430 --> 42:31.430]  I went through half of that game without realizing you could do like a dash move by clicking B.
[42:32.410 --> 42:33.830]  And that's a tough game.
[42:33.830 --> 42:37.110]  There was a boss that I could not escape his area of effect attack.
[42:37.170 --> 42:39.430]  Like I tried to run away and it almost always got me.
[42:39.490 --> 42:40.830]  And I was like, this is fucking impossible.
[42:41.170 --> 42:42.990]  I didn't realize I just didn't know how to deal with it.
[42:43.230 --> 42:43.910]  That was the issue.
[42:43.990 --> 42:44.990]  It wasn't that it was poorly designed.
[42:45.430 --> 42:50.510]  I was probably 30 hours into Cyberpunk before Gavin mentioned double jump to me.
[42:50.610 --> 42:51.730]  And I found out that that was a thing.
[42:51.910 --> 42:52.990]  And that changed the whole game.
[42:53.290 --> 42:55.730]  Yeah, it totally changes the way you travel.
[42:55.830 --> 42:57.050]  You have to buy that though, right?
[42:57.250 --> 42:58.490]  Yeah, yeah, it's like an upgrade.
[42:58.630 --> 42:59.490]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:59.550 --> 43:00.630]  So I mean, that's a little different.
[43:00.970 --> 43:02.090]  Like you didn't start with that.
[43:02.090 --> 43:06.110]  You also missed a mechanic in Outer Wilds, Andrew.
[43:06.470 --> 43:08.150]  I can't remember what it was, but that was like...
[43:08.150 --> 43:12.050]  I think you found the ending without learning how to do something.
[43:12.570 --> 43:13.330]  Do you remember what I'm talking about?
[43:13.510 --> 43:14.490]  I'm trying not to spoil it.
[43:14.670 --> 43:17.710]  I don't... yeah, I'm trying to... yeah, I'm trying to remember what...
[43:17.710 --> 43:19.210]  Because it's a game you can only play once, really.
[43:19.330 --> 43:20.650]  It's like, it's all about the discovery.
[43:20.790 --> 43:21.630]  So I'm not going to say what it was.
[43:21.690 --> 43:26.870]  But you like did a thing without recognizing the bit that teaches you how to do that.
[43:27.310 --> 43:27.630]  Yeah.
[43:28.050 --> 43:29.470]  Whereas I found the thing that teaches you.
[43:29.490 --> 43:31.070]  And I was like, wow, I'm going to go try that.
[43:31.070 --> 43:32.590]  I was stuck on that part.
[43:32.650 --> 43:37.070]  That was during a time where every game I seemed to miss a huge mechanic.
[43:37.470 --> 43:39.130]  Yeah, like fast travel and control.
[43:39.750 --> 43:41.870]  Yeah, I didn't know the fast travel and control.
[43:42.290 --> 43:43.010]  And I got through.
[43:43.110 --> 43:47.370]  I beat Ghost Recon Breakpoint before realizing you had a special you could do.
[43:47.670 --> 43:52.750]  If you push both bumpers or whatever, you're going to a special mode like in Destiny.
[43:53.310 --> 43:55.150]  Not quite that elaborate, but I just didn't know.
[43:55.410 --> 43:58.530]  Dude, Barbara didn't know there was fast travel in Skyrim.
[43:59.050 --> 44:00.430]  I remember that being a big thing.
[44:00.430 --> 44:04.010]  She was like, she spent a lot of fucking time traveling around that map.
[44:04.010 --> 44:08.150]  God, that must like triple or quadruple the amount of time you'd spend in that game.
[44:08.550 --> 44:13.230]  Yeah, you probably level up like a motherfucker because you have encounters every 10 minutes,
[44:13.330 --> 44:13.470]  right?
[44:14.030 --> 44:15.930]  You'd kill the frost trolls in the world.
[44:17.310 --> 44:22.170]  Speaking of things we don't know about, I feel like we have to discuss our Twitter account.
[44:22.650 --> 44:24.410]  What a fantastic reveal that was.
[44:24.910 --> 44:27.890]  I don't know if everyone... you don't know about this, Gavin?
[44:27.950 --> 44:29.410]  I'm familiar with what you're talking about.
[44:29.410 --> 44:31.930]  I didn't know that we were going to discuss it or not.
[44:32.310 --> 44:33.970]  But I feel... well, no.
[44:34.130 --> 44:37.150]  Like, did you not see the person is handing off the account now?
[44:37.190 --> 44:38.210]  Yeah, I saw the whole thing.
[44:39.230 --> 44:42.350]  One of the reasons they mentioned is because I started following them on Twitter.
[44:43.790 --> 44:47.170]  We have... there's a FacePod Twitter account, Gavin.
[44:47.390 --> 44:47.930]  And Instagram.
[44:48.630 --> 44:49.390]  Yeah, and Instagram.
[44:49.550 --> 44:50.810]  But we control the Instagram.
[44:51.010 --> 44:53.670]  But the Twitter was the thing that just popped up one day.
[44:53.990 --> 44:55.530]  I was like, I don't know who runs that.
[44:56.070 --> 44:58.610]  And they just were making posts.
[44:58.750 --> 45:00.730]  Like, they take the Instagram posts, they make their own posts.
[45:00.810 --> 45:02.290]  They did content for it.
[45:02.690 --> 45:04.090]  They're regularly updating it.
[45:04.650 --> 45:06.130]  It seemed very official.
[45:06.750 --> 45:09.490]  But I thought... I asked Eric, do you know who runs this account?
[45:09.610 --> 45:10.330]  Eric had no idea.
[45:10.450 --> 45:10.950]  I asked Geoff.
[45:11.030 --> 45:11.650]  Geoff didn't know.
[45:12.030 --> 45:15.090]  I was like, oh, I guess just somebody who's running this account that's really funny.
[45:15.230 --> 45:16.390]  I really thought it was Andrew.
[45:17.210 --> 45:17.650]  No!
[45:18.190 --> 45:21.230]  So you thought each other were running the Twitter account?
[45:21.230 --> 45:22.990]  No, I thought we...
[45:22.990 --> 45:25.070]  I remembered having a conversation about it.
[45:25.070 --> 45:26.230]  I thought we must have...
[45:26.230 --> 45:27.550]  I remember talking about it.
[45:27.590 --> 45:29.890]  So it must be legit and on the up and up.
[45:31.510 --> 45:32.890]  I'm pretty sure Andrew's running it.
[45:32.970 --> 45:33.310]  It's whatever.
[45:33.590 --> 45:35.850]  I knew it was community run.
[45:36.070 --> 45:37.770]  And that's why I didn't follow it.
[45:38.050 --> 45:41.370]  And then when you started following the account, I was like, well, I guess I'll just follow it too.
[45:41.450 --> 45:42.390]  I guess we're all on board.
[45:42.490 --> 45:43.010]  This is fine.
[45:43.250 --> 45:44.710]  Just somebody in the community is doing this.
[45:45.030 --> 45:46.330]  I had no idea who it was.
[45:46.750 --> 45:50.290]  They recently just came forward because they reached 10,000 followers.
[45:50.450 --> 45:52.410]  They've been doing this for seven months.
[45:52.410 --> 45:55.290]  And they kept waiting for us to call them out for it.
[45:55.430 --> 45:56.730]  And we just never did.
[46:00.070 --> 46:01.170]  We're committed to the bit.
[46:01.910 --> 46:02.830]  Oh, my God.
[46:03.430 --> 46:05.230]  That's such a nice problem to have.
[46:05.330 --> 46:07.950]  Just like a bunch of people shrug and be like, oh, I mean, it's working.
[46:08.770 --> 46:09.130]  Yeah.
[46:09.230 --> 46:11.090]  Like they're doing an amazing job.
[46:11.230 --> 46:12.370]  They posted constantly.
[46:12.490 --> 46:13.150]  It was great.
[46:13.370 --> 46:13.690]  Yeah.
[46:15.530 --> 46:17.570]  It really was like, I don't know who runs that.
[46:17.650 --> 46:19.570]  That's probably a thing we should take care of.
[46:19.630 --> 46:20.090]  But whatever.
[46:20.250 --> 46:21.250]  Like they're doing awesome.
[46:21.810 --> 46:25.190]  I was just like, I was just like, we're not talking about it.
[46:25.250 --> 46:26.630]  But Andrew's doing a really good job.
[46:26.730 --> 46:28.110]  So I'll just let him keep doing it.
[46:29.130 --> 46:31.010]  I didn't realize that you thought I did it.
[46:31.070 --> 46:32.650]  I thought we were all on board and we're OK with.
[46:32.790 --> 46:34.610]  I definitely know it wasn't one of us.
[46:34.830 --> 46:35.630]  I thought you ran it.
[46:36.690 --> 46:37.850]  No, not at all.
[46:38.250 --> 46:42.990]  So we've had this Twitter account that existed for seven months and just crossed 10,000.
[46:43.350 --> 46:47.290]  They essentially were like, the panic mode for them was when Geoff started following them.
[46:47.290 --> 46:51.650]  And then the second one was, I guess, they did a port-a-potty post
[46:51.650 --> 46:55.350]  and the official Rooster Teeth account tagged them in the post.
[46:56.150 --> 47:00.710]  I like that we work for a company where there are several staff members
[47:00.710 --> 47:04.670]  just to deal with social media and none of those people are involved either.
[47:05.070 --> 47:06.510]  No, I like that.
[47:06.770 --> 47:11.210]  It appears like it wasn't even a conversation amongst them of like, who is doing this?
[47:11.990 --> 47:14.490]  Eric says you should see the face jam Instagram.
[47:15.110 --> 47:15.770]  Why should we see it?
[47:16.110 --> 47:16.990]  Yeah, what does that mean?
[47:16.990 --> 47:19.250]  Sorry, I knocked over my mouse.
[47:20.470 --> 47:27.150]  There is a face jam Instagram account that for a month and a half,
[47:27.510 --> 47:31.210]  I had to convince Louis that we didn't own or run.
[47:31.750 --> 47:36.450]  And no matter how many times I said, yeah, we don't have an Instagram account.
[47:37.090 --> 47:41.710]  He's like, no, I don't know what to do in that situation.
[47:42.270 --> 47:46.770]  But it's exactly like this where nobody runs it.
[47:47.130 --> 47:53.170]  Look at how many people that work for our company follow the face jam Instagram account.
[47:53.330 --> 47:55.790]  It is the same thing.
[47:56.150 --> 47:57.510]  This is wild.
[47:57.770 --> 48:02.750]  I can't believe this happened with two fucking shows that I have anything to do with.
[48:03.070 --> 48:03.550]  This is ridiculous.
[48:03.970 --> 48:08.130]  It's amazing for such for a company that was so involved in the internet from such an early time,
[48:08.450 --> 48:09.870]  you know, with internet companies.
[48:09.870 --> 48:13.650]  That's amazing that we don't that so many people are clueless to it.
[48:13.950 --> 48:16.650]  You know, what's even funnier to me is that sure.
[48:16.770 --> 48:20.190]  Well, I mean, I guess as of now, we absolutely run that Twitter account.
[48:20.310 --> 48:22.650]  Yeah, you know, because we're fucking professionals.
[48:23.010 --> 48:27.150]  We don't have it yet, but we'll get it by the time this episode comes out.
[48:27.210 --> 48:28.090]  It will. We will have it forever.
[48:28.230 --> 48:28.530]  Yeah.
[48:29.150 --> 48:34.350]  However, the thing that's craziest to me is that we do operate some Twitter accounts
[48:34.350 --> 48:36.170]  that the audience has no idea about.
[48:36.170 --> 48:40.470]  Like, like we do have stuff out there that we do like.
[48:40.890 --> 48:44.350]  There are Twitter accounts related to Face that exist out there.
[48:44.470 --> 48:45.430]  The audience has not found.
[48:45.830 --> 48:47.290]  You know, it's funny is one of them.
[48:47.690 --> 48:50.950]  You can tell when my phone broke because I was tweeting on it every day.
[48:50.950 --> 48:52.250]  And then the tweets just stopped.
[48:52.330 --> 48:54.670]  That is the day my phone died.
[48:54.830 --> 48:55.910]  It's marked through that.
[48:55.970 --> 48:58.650]  You have secret Face related Twitter accounts.
[48:58.870 --> 48:59.030]  Yeah.
[48:59.750 --> 49:00.190]  Yeah.
[49:00.670 --> 49:01.290]  Yeah, we have a few.
[49:01.690 --> 49:01.750]  Yeah.
[49:02.270 --> 49:05.770]  He probably has he probably has the ones I don't even know of.
[49:05.770 --> 49:06.590]  I know of a few.
[49:07.030 --> 49:07.390]  There's a few.
[49:07.710 --> 49:08.290]  There's not.
[49:08.630 --> 49:09.550]  I won't say anything.
[49:10.310 --> 49:10.950]  There's a few.
[49:11.290 --> 49:12.170]  There's a few that exist.
[49:12.490 --> 49:13.190]  Now I'm suspicious.
[49:13.830 --> 49:14.050]  Yeah.
[49:15.990 --> 49:17.630]  You know, they're show related.
[49:18.090 --> 49:19.270]  You know, one other thing I will say.
[49:19.430 --> 49:22.150]  This is a bit of a side again, going back to the bathroom stuff.
[49:22.230 --> 49:25.450]  But I will say, Andrew, we talk about audience being surprised.
[49:26.010 --> 49:29.870]  The audience was definitely surprised that you filled your bathtub while you were in it.
[49:29.870 --> 49:37.170]  I was surprised at how many people came to your defense in terms of smashing up a cupcake in a bowl.
[49:37.490 --> 49:40.770]  There were a lot of people out there that were like, absolutely, I do that, too.
[49:40.970 --> 49:42.450]  Everybody does that totally normal.
[49:42.950 --> 49:44.170]  That seemed weird to me.
[49:44.450 --> 49:46.910]  But but the audience really had your back on that one.
[49:46.950 --> 49:47.990]  So congratulations there.
[49:48.850 --> 49:53.290]  I heard people suggesting and I never even considered this ripping the bottom part of
[49:53.290 --> 49:56.650]  the cupcake off and then putting that on top and making like a cupcake sandwich.
[49:57.030 --> 49:58.390]  That's an interesting idea.
[49:58.390 --> 49:59.870]  That is an interesting idea.
[50:00.010 --> 50:03.570]  I mean, I just don't understand that people just don't like cupcakes.
[50:03.690 --> 50:04.770]  Oh, sure, Eric does it.
[50:04.850 --> 50:07.110]  It's a failed format for most people.
[50:07.490 --> 50:08.910]  I don't understand why people don't like cupcakes.
[50:09.230 --> 50:10.290]  I enjoy the cupcake a lot.
[50:10.390 --> 50:12.790]  If you have to modify it, then it's not right, is it?
[50:13.390 --> 50:13.930]  Reinvent it.
[50:14.070 --> 50:14.930]  Make sandwiches.
[50:15.330 --> 50:17.510]  I would never buy, though, what I have in a bowl.
[50:17.670 --> 50:19.190]  Like, I would not pay money for that.
[50:19.370 --> 50:20.630]  You would pay for a bowl of mush?
[50:21.110 --> 50:22.410]  No, it looks disgusting.
[50:22.530 --> 50:25.830]  But it's like you're distributing the icing amongst the rest of the cake evenly.
[50:26.250 --> 50:26.950]  I get it.
[50:27.010 --> 50:27.890]  I totally get it.
[50:27.890 --> 50:30.090]  Yeah, it's a great thing.
[50:30.150 --> 50:33.270]  I guess you're increasing the surface area to staleness.
[50:33.550 --> 50:35.210]  So that's probably why you couldn't sell it that way.
[50:35.550 --> 50:35.950]  Sure.
[50:36.390 --> 50:37.490]  It just would look disgusting.
[50:37.930 --> 50:41.090]  It's not visually appealing in any way.
[50:41.550 --> 50:43.250]  But yeah, I just I wanted to make sure we shut it out.
[50:43.350 --> 50:49.090]  I think his Twitter account is like solar424 or something that ran our Twitter, the face Twitter.
[50:49.510 --> 50:51.370]  Did a great job running.
[50:51.650 --> 50:52.370]  Fantastic job.
[50:53.150 --> 50:53.950]  Thanks, solar424.
[50:54.590 --> 50:55.910]  Really kicked the shit out of that for us.
[50:56.030 --> 50:56.450]  Appreciate it.
[50:56.790 --> 50:57.690]  I have one other thing.
[50:57.890 --> 50:59.390]  I need to talk about that.
[51:01.030 --> 51:04.410]  You might be disappointed, especially you, Gavin.
[51:04.870 --> 51:07.430]  I don't know if my fire extinguisher is going to work.
[51:08.010 --> 51:08.850]  Oh, why?
[51:09.030 --> 51:12.170]  Yeah, well, because I didn't I didn't realize this.
[51:12.510 --> 51:19.630]  But when you use a fire extinguisher, what you do, you pull the pin and then you use it.
[51:19.950 --> 51:23.330]  You're not supposed to pull the pin until usage time.
[51:23.850 --> 51:26.910]  I pulled the pin the day of our very first recording.
[51:26.910 --> 51:30.590]  So the fire extinguisher has been armed the entire time.
[51:31.350 --> 51:32.630]  Every episode we've done.
[51:32.830 --> 51:36.250]  The pin, it just makes it safe to squeeze the handle.
[51:36.550 --> 51:37.370]  It's like it's just a safety.
[51:37.650 --> 51:38.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:38.570 --> 51:44.410]  But OK, so there's a pressure gauge on my fire extinguisher and it is deep in the red recharge
[51:44.410 --> 51:48.810]  zone. So I think this entire time it's just been depressurizing slowly.
[51:49.250 --> 51:53.310]  I'm pretty sure you just got a partially filled or like depleted.
[51:53.510 --> 51:55.410]  I don't think the pin is anything to do with that, though.
[51:55.470 --> 51:56.530]  Yeah, no, he's right.
[51:56.530 --> 51:59.610]  Fire extinguishers don't maintain a charge forever.
[51:59.810 --> 52:02.950]  You need to get them recharged, like at the fire department or some shit.
[52:03.070 --> 52:05.030]  Pretty like every two years or something.
[52:05.390 --> 52:08.230]  So it probably just lost pressure naturally over time.
[52:08.550 --> 52:08.950]  I see.
[52:09.310 --> 52:10.770]  So me pulling the pin had no...
[52:10.770 --> 52:12.590]  No, because that's just like a little cotter pin.
[52:12.590 --> 52:16.450]  That's not doing anything other than stopping you from hitting it accidentally.
[52:16.710 --> 52:16.930]  Got it.
[52:17.430 --> 52:19.430]  OK, well, I feel less bad about that.
[52:19.730 --> 52:23.490]  I had to pull the pin because it's where I could attach the pop filter onto the thing.
[52:23.490 --> 52:27.050]  It's the only part that would work and it wouldn't fit with the pin in there.
[52:27.430 --> 52:28.590]  Yeah, so I had to pull the pin.
[52:29.130 --> 52:31.010]  You know, Eric brings up a good point.
[52:31.490 --> 52:34.310]  If it's deep in the red, it's probably not going to work anyway.
[52:34.590 --> 52:36.310]  So you could squeeze it right now.
[52:36.410 --> 52:37.810]  Yeah, just see the range on it.
[52:37.850 --> 52:42.310]  No, it'd be good to get a benchmark of like how far red goes compared to how far green.
[52:42.310 --> 52:43.310]  No, because you can't do it multiple times.
[52:43.490 --> 52:45.550]  You get one shot and I'm not going to...
[52:45.550 --> 52:46.290]  That's not true.
[52:46.910 --> 52:47.430]  I think that is true.
[52:47.430 --> 52:48.770]  What is this, episode 48?
[52:49.410 --> 52:51.670]  All right, you got four fucking weeks to figure it out, dude.
[52:51.950 --> 52:53.030]  You got to hit that button in 52.
[52:53.510 --> 52:54.710]  I have a plan.
[52:54.850 --> 52:55.810]  I worked it out already.
[52:55.890 --> 52:57.530]  I have an idea for how to make this work.
[52:57.690 --> 52:59.530]  Well, you're going to shoot it into a bag though, aren't you?
[52:59.590 --> 53:00.010]  It's not going to...
[53:00.010 --> 53:01.410]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:01.550 --> 53:03.250]  No, I had a, I had a realization.
[53:03.650 --> 53:07.470]  I'm not going to spoil it, but I have, I have a way that I think this will work.
[53:07.690 --> 53:08.010]  Okay.
[53:08.410 --> 53:09.430]  And I need to put it together.
[53:09.670 --> 53:11.350]  But it's, it's, I have a thought.
[53:11.510 --> 53:11.950]  You have a...
[53:11.950 --> 53:13.010]  I don't see how this could fail.
[53:13.030 --> 53:16.570]  You have a contraption you're going to construct.
[53:17.110 --> 53:18.710]  Uh, a thing will need to be built.
[53:18.830 --> 53:18.970]  Yeah.
[53:19.150 --> 53:19.470]  Yes.
[53:19.470 --> 53:25.130]  I'm trying to, but judged off like previous f*** face bits, I'm trying to decide whether
[53:25.130 --> 53:27.330]  or not I'm going to get excited about this or not.
[53:28.450 --> 53:28.810]  Uh...
[53:28.810 --> 53:31.910]  Am I going to get my hopes up about this or is it going to be a salad cream?
[53:32.030 --> 53:32.970]  That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[53:33.250 --> 53:37.770]  I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, well, I feel confident in that you feel one
[53:37.770 --> 53:40.150]  way about it and then just edit yourself out of it later.
[53:43.610 --> 53:45.170]  That's where my head is at with that.
[53:45.310 --> 53:46.390]  I can only control me.
[53:49.470 --> 53:51.050]  Four weeks, four episodes.
[53:51.490 --> 53:55.810]  Oh, before we end this, and we should end it so I can go do anything else other than
[53:55.810 --> 53:56.050]  this.
[53:57.370 --> 53:58.570]  Yeah, this is a joke.
[53:58.810 --> 53:59.570]  I got nothing else to do.
[53:59.850 --> 54:01.370]  We should talk about baseball bats.
[54:01.570 --> 54:02.250]  Gav, you weren't there.
[54:02.330 --> 54:07.150]  We had a meeting with merch right before this episode and there's been an update on the
[54:07.150 --> 54:08.150]  knob situation.
[54:08.710 --> 54:09.130]  Uh, it was fine.
[54:09.510 --> 54:14.550]  However, you know, where we left off with the knob issue is that we were having trouble
[54:14.550 --> 54:17.530]  finding somebody to create just knobs for us.
[54:17.530 --> 54:23.830]  I made a suggestion that I could, uh, I could de-knob the bats myself with a chop saw.
[54:24.230 --> 54:24.650]  Love that.
[54:25.130 --> 54:25.550]  Agree.
[54:25.830 --> 54:28.290]  Then you made the suggestion I was going to do 500.
[54:28.530 --> 54:32.850]  You made the suggestion that we probably need a thousand because previous bat iterations
[54:32.850 --> 54:33.530]  have sold so quickly.
[54:33.530 --> 54:36.010]  We want it to be on sale for longer than 60 seconds.
[54:36.530 --> 54:39.330]  I think also it was the phrase thousand knob drop, right?
[54:39.650 --> 54:40.450]  Thousand knob drop.
[54:40.750 --> 54:45.330]  And then somebody in the comments had a brilliant idea, which was similar to an idea that I
[54:45.330 --> 54:50.330]  think we had actually in the episode about trying to pair up knobs to their bats and ways
[54:50.330 --> 54:50.810]  to do that.
[54:51.070 --> 54:53.470]  But, uh, Henry's barking at...
[54:55.630 --> 54:56.110]  Damn.
[54:56.510 --> 54:57.390]  Fucking no idea.
[54:57.950 --> 54:59.990]  Um, maybe a mailman or something.
[55:00.130 --> 55:00.930]  Just go for it, buddy.
[55:00.990 --> 55:01.510]  Just keep going.
[55:02.270 --> 55:07.690]  Uh, anyway, so, uh, the, the, the reality is, is that a fucking baseball bat is expensive
[55:08.270 --> 55:08.830]  to ship.
[55:09.250 --> 55:13.530]  And a thousand baseball bats shipping to my house is going to cost more than we could,
[55:13.530 --> 55:18.410]  just to get them here so that I can cut them up, would cost more probably than we could
[55:18.410 --> 55:19.830]  ever hope to sell them for.
[55:19.990 --> 55:23.590]  I'm struggling to see how it could be that expensive to ship a thousand bats.
[55:23.910 --> 55:25.330]  They're just, it's a lot of wood, man.
[55:25.370 --> 55:26.270]  It's a lot of size.
[55:26.470 --> 55:27.390]  It's pallets worth.
[55:27.910 --> 55:32.830]  And so what we settled on is maybe we'll get a thousand, maybe we'll get nine, get a thousand
[55:32.830 --> 55:36.130]  bats made and I will get a hundred sent to me.
[55:36.130 --> 55:44.490]  Then I'll, I'll lob off the knob on a hundred, put in a tag on each one to number one through
[55:44.490 --> 55:44.790]  a hundred.
[55:45.010 --> 55:48.550]  We've got, we found these little metal tags that I can hammer in to, to make it nice.
[55:48.870 --> 55:53.910]  And then you'll have like a one in 10 chance when you buy a knob of getting one that I,
[55:54.090 --> 55:54.770]  I made.
[55:55.050 --> 55:55.530]  Does that make sense?
[55:56.030 --> 55:57.910]  But you're not making the knobs anymore.
[55:58.190 --> 56:00.150]  I'm going to make a hundred out of the thousand.
[56:00.390 --> 56:01.590]  So what's the other 900?
[56:01.830 --> 56:03.750]  They're not, they're just going to go, they're just going to go straight.
[56:03.750 --> 56:07.170]  They're just going to go straight to the, I guess they're just going to be knobs.
[56:07.450 --> 56:07.970]  They're no bats.
[56:08.190 --> 56:08.670]  They're just knobs.
[56:09.070 --> 56:09.230]  Yeah.
[56:09.330 --> 56:12.470]  Why not just knob them all and then give you what?
[56:12.690 --> 56:13.690]  I don't understand that at all.
[56:14.010 --> 56:16.630]  If they're good, if the other 900 are going to be knobbed.
[56:16.630 --> 56:16.850]  Yeah.
[56:17.150 --> 56:18.330]  Why not just give those to you?
[56:18.570 --> 56:20.030]  What am I going to do with knobbed bats?
[56:20.930 --> 56:22.750]  What are you going to do with the ones that you've got again?
[56:23.150 --> 56:24.330]  I'm going to, I'm going to make them.
[56:24.450 --> 56:25.230]  I'm going to knob them.
[56:25.550 --> 56:29.430]  I'm going to knob a hundred and then the other ones will just be made as knobs.
[56:29.730 --> 56:32.630]  So we're going to make, we're going to get 900 knobs and a hundred bats.
[56:33.050 --> 56:35.810]  And then I'm going to make, it's not convoluted.
[56:35.890 --> 56:36.370]  It's easy.
[56:36.870 --> 56:41.010]  But if we can make the knobs, just make a thousand knobs.
[56:41.390 --> 56:42.630]  Oh, so I don't have to do any?
[56:43.130 --> 56:43.270]  Yeah.
[56:43.270 --> 56:45.950]  Oh, I thought, I thought the, I thought the audience wanted my misery.
[56:47.050 --> 56:49.610]  But if I, if I don't, if I don't have to make a knob,
[56:49.770 --> 56:51.530]  if I don't have to make a knob, I'm not going to make a knob.
[56:51.610 --> 56:52.130]  That's even better.
[56:52.390 --> 56:53.270]  Then you just let me out.
[56:53.510 --> 56:54.310]  No, Gavin's right.
[56:54.610 --> 56:55.130]  That Gavin's right.
[56:55.190 --> 56:56.550]  We're going to get a thousand knobs made.
[56:56.650 --> 56:57.730]  I don't have to touch shit.
[56:58.390 --> 56:58.950]  Problem solved.
[56:59.050 --> 57:00.050]  This is an awesome idea.
[57:00.250 --> 57:01.110]  Not what I'm saying at all.
[57:01.650 --> 57:02.990]  100% what you're saying.
[57:03.230 --> 57:06.610]  Ship all 1000 to Geoff for him to sign or whatever.
[57:06.990 --> 57:08.470]  Fuck you. I already signed stuff.
[57:08.590 --> 57:09.890]  No, I'll knob a bat.
[57:10.450 --> 57:11.490]  Andrew's not signed shit.
[57:11.810 --> 57:14.530]  I'll knob a bat, but I'm not going to, for a reason.
[57:14.870 --> 57:17.390]  But I can't do a thousand because it's too expensive to get here.
[57:17.510 --> 57:20.350]  So I'll knob a hundred bats and those will be special bats.
[57:20.390 --> 57:23.150]  And you'll have a one in 10 chance of getting a special bat when you buy your bat.
[57:23.170 --> 57:27.030]  I just freight shipped something that weighs way more than a thousand bats.
[57:27.070 --> 57:28.290]  And it wasn't absurd.
[57:28.570 --> 57:29.610]  I think it can be done.
[57:29.610 --> 57:32.290]  I think that you should talk to the merch department
[57:32.290 --> 57:34.750]  and show up to the meetings if you want to have a say.
[57:40.750 --> 57:42.830]  What if you did a thousand nails?
[57:43.530 --> 57:45.730]  What about that or whatever you're going to hammer it?
[57:45.830 --> 57:46.430]  Is that possible?
[57:46.650 --> 57:47.670]  I'm just throwing that out there.
[57:49.410 --> 57:54.410]  Also, if we ship a full-size bat to an audience member,
[57:54.630 --> 57:58.870]  it's going to be like $20 just in shipping cost on top of that.
[57:58.910 --> 58:01.850]  That's how buying stuff online works, though.
[58:02.010 --> 58:03.690]  Big things cost more to ship.
[58:03.830 --> 58:04.750]  That's just how it works.
[58:05.010 --> 58:08.410]  But I don't want to make somebody pay a hundred bucks for a fucking baseball bat.
[58:09.090 --> 58:10.390]  I'm with Geoff on this.
[58:10.850 --> 58:12.830]  But I feel like there's maybe a middle.
[58:13.090 --> 58:14.630]  And they just want the knob, man.
[58:15.010 --> 58:16.110]  They don't want the knobless bat.
[58:16.170 --> 58:17.050]  They just want the knob.
[58:17.410 --> 58:20.350]  So why don't we just give them the knob and just get only knobs made?
[58:20.430 --> 58:21.850]  That way we're saving some treats.
[58:21.850 --> 58:24.230]  Yeah, make a thousand knobs, ship them to Geoff.
[58:24.330 --> 58:26.130]  Geoff burns them, signs them, whatever.
[58:26.570 --> 58:28.850]  We're not talking about burning anything.
[58:29.570 --> 58:31.450]  That's off the table, dude.
[58:31.570 --> 58:33.510]  I agree to cut knobs.
[58:33.710 --> 58:34.950]  I will cut a hundred knobs.
[58:34.950 --> 58:35.290]  No, no, no.
[58:35.290 --> 58:36.410]  That's fair. That's fine.
[58:36.770 --> 58:36.930]  A thousand.
[58:37.170 --> 58:39.510]  No, I thought you were going to do a nail thing.
[58:39.890 --> 58:42.050]  I will do the nail thing on top of that.
[58:42.610 --> 58:44.170]  But I'm not going to do a thousand nails.
[58:44.310 --> 58:45.050]  There's no point in it.
[58:45.190 --> 58:49.430]  The whole idea of the nail was that we had a knobless bat and we had a knob, right?
[58:49.550 --> 58:52.790]  And before I separated the two, I put a little tag.
[58:52.790 --> 58:56.510]  I hammered a little metal tag into the knob that said 0008.
[58:56.610 --> 59:01.090]  And then I numbered a little tag into the top of the bat that said 008.
[59:01.170 --> 59:03.410]  Then when I cut it, they go into two different piles.
[59:03.570 --> 59:07.250]  And then maybe you buy a knob or maybe you buy a knobless bat and you end up with two
[59:07.250 --> 59:07.730]  different ones.
[59:07.930 --> 59:11.930]  And then maybe you enter in the thing online and be like, hey, I've got knob 26.
[59:12.310 --> 59:14.050]  Is knobless bat 26 out there?
[59:14.170 --> 59:15.310]  And then you make a fucking friend.
[59:15.370 --> 59:16.550]  You become knob twins or whatever.
[59:16.810 --> 59:20.250]  But I don't think that's going to be possible because bats are too fucking weighty and expensive.
[59:20.490 --> 59:20.510]  Yeah.
[59:20.510 --> 59:24.530]  So we're just going to do knobs, which is all the audience wants anyway.
[59:24.910 --> 59:30.370]  But I think that the audience really latches on to the misery index of it with me.
[59:30.550 --> 59:34.030]  And so I'm agreeing to make, to be, I'll be miserable making 100 knobs.
[59:34.170 --> 59:36.090]  I would have been way more miserable making a thousand.
[59:36.230 --> 59:37.890]  It's just logistically very difficult to get.
[59:38.010 --> 59:41.470]  What's worse, making a hundred knobs or branding a thousand knobs?
[59:42.070 --> 59:44.710]  Well, I'd have to make a hundred knobs and brand those hundred knobs.
[59:44.850 --> 59:47.550]  So I'd say it's probably six and a half dozen.
[59:47.810 --> 59:47.950]  What?
[59:48.490 --> 59:48.850]  What?
[59:49.950 --> 59:50.310]  Why?
[59:50.490 --> 59:51.130]  What do you want?
[59:51.230 --> 59:52.690]  So you're not nailing the knobs?
[59:52.930 --> 59:54.790]  You're nailing the knobless bats?
[59:54.950 --> 59:55.830]  That was the idea for that?
[59:56.090 --> 59:57.010]  I'll nail the knobs too.
[59:57.130 --> 59:57.250]  Yeah.
[59:57.630 --> 59:58.790]  Okay. Well, then that's what I'm saying.
[59:59.090 --> 59:59.530]  I'll be honest.
[59:59.710 --> 01:00:01.670]  My Discord crashed in the middle of that.
[01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.210]  And I don't know most of what you just said.
[01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.630]  I mean, to be fair to you, I've been here the whole time.
[01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:08.450]  It's still confusing.
[01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:09.910]  There's constant knob talk.
[01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.410]  And I feel like people are saying bats when they should be saying knobs.
[01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:17.930]  I just think you could brand a thousand knobs easier than making a hundred bat knobs.
[01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.830]  But nobody wants me to brand a thousand knobs.
[01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:22.410]  They wanted me to make knobs.
[01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.690]  Why not? That's really annoying.
[01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.090]  That's blood and sweat, isn't it?
[01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:26.130]  Eric.
[01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:30.530]  Oh, hold on a second.
[01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:31.290]  I got an idea.
[01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.590]  Thanks for listening to F*** Face, episode 48.
[01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.030]  Really appreciate it.
[01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.650]  If you want to go ahead and let a friend know about this podcast,
[01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:40.690]  we could really use it.
[01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:42.130]  Maybe buy a t-shirt or a hat.
[01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:43.810]  We got some knobs coming in the future.
[01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:46.590]  They may or may not be branded.
[01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:51.630]  Either way, at a minimum, you're gonna have a 1 in 10 chance of getting a knob made by Geoff.
[01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:52.750]  At least that's what I'm thinking.
[01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:58.330]  Also, we got a little surprise dropping at the end of the month for you guys in terms of content.
[01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:00.170]  So keep your eyes open for that.
[01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:01.710]  And as always, write a review.
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:03.570]  And hopefully we'll see you next week.
[01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.250]  Thanks a lot, everybody.
[01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.830]  Nick, go ahead and roll that outro music.
[01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:08.230]  Yeah, follow the Twitter as well.
[01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.090]  Oh yeah, let's get the Twitter up to...
[01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:13.030]  Like our Instagram's got like 30,000 subscribers or something.
[01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.370]  We should get that Twitter up.
[01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:16.510]  Especially now that we're not f***ing around with Twitter anymore.
[01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:18.630]  So who's running it?
