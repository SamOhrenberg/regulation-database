[01:05.850 --> 01:12.870]  Hello, and welcome to episode 49 of the f***face podcast. Hard to believe it's already been
[01:13.350 --> 01:16.710]  49 weeks of this nonsense. My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me, as always,
[01:17.190 --> 01:21.030]  Andrew Panton and Gavin Free. Hello, boys.
[01:21.250 --> 01:21.870]  Hello! Hey!
[01:22.470 --> 01:23.430]  Whoa, Gavin's here.
[01:23.690 --> 01:27.430]  I was trying to draw it out to give him time to sneak on in.
[01:27.590 --> 01:29.890]  Really? I thought the opposite. I thought you were going to try to
[01:29.890 --> 01:31.610]  throw him under the bus and have him be quiet.
[01:31.870 --> 01:33.610]  Did you not hear me say hello before we started?
[01:33.610 --> 01:35.350]  No, we did not hear that.
[01:35.410 --> 01:36.250]  Why did you start then?
[01:36.550 --> 01:41.030]  Well, it's possible I was doing what Andrew said and not the thing I said.
[01:41.110 --> 01:43.210]  What? Oh, yeah, trying to throw... yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43.290 --> 01:44.950]  Well, definitely. What do you mean?
[01:45.230 --> 01:47.830]  Nobody believed that you're trying to, like, drag it out to be supportive.
[01:47.970 --> 01:50.150]  Why start it in the first place if that's your motive?
[01:50.290 --> 01:54.430]  Yeah, to catch him off guard and to ruin a tiny moment of his day.
[01:54.450 --> 01:57.430]  Didn't someone ask me if I was recording and I said yes out loud?
[01:57.470 --> 01:59.550]  No, nobody heard anything. Here's what happened.
[02:00.590 --> 02:02.810]  Hold on, because the audience, they might not have heard it either.
[02:03.010 --> 02:05.710]  Let's recreate it. All right, Andrew, you be Gavin.
[02:05.990 --> 02:07.150]  Okay. And I'll be us.
[02:07.390 --> 02:08.830]  Okay. Are you ready?
[02:08.870 --> 02:09.870]  Yep. I'm ready.
[02:10.190 --> 02:11.970]  Oh, hey, Gavin's here. Hey, Gavin, are you recording?
[02:14.150 --> 02:15.150]  Okay, I guess we'll start.
[02:15.570 --> 02:16.810]  Interesting. I don't know what happened.
[02:17.050 --> 02:20.050]  That might be the best impression I've ever done. I feel like I should get credit for that.
[02:20.110 --> 02:21.570]  You fucking nailed it.
[02:21.870 --> 02:22.550]  Yeah. You nailed it.
[02:22.590 --> 02:25.090]  Nailed it. How are you guys doing?
[02:25.270 --> 02:26.170]  I'm doing well. How are you doing?
[02:26.290 --> 02:27.950]  I'm good. How are you doing, Gavin?
[02:27.950 --> 02:31.910]  Good. I heard Mr. Panton got a package this week.
[02:32.070 --> 02:37.290]  I did. Before we get to that, though, I want to... you've been... there are a few things, Gavin.
[02:37.650 --> 02:43.630]  Gavin will sometimes text me occasionally, and it'll be just throwaway questions
[02:44.250 --> 02:48.630]  that nobody will think about. Gavin asked me probably three and a half months ago.
[02:48.770 --> 02:52.910]  When did Christopher Plummer die? How long ago is that? If someone could look it up.
[02:52.930 --> 02:53.270]  Oh, Fleabuds.
[02:54.230 --> 02:58.530]  Yeah. Gavin asked me, he wanted to talk about a Christopher Plummer trivia thing,
[02:58.770 --> 03:02.850]  and he opened it with, what's the most interesting piece of movie trivia you know?
[03:03.170 --> 03:06.110]  And I'm still thinking about it. I haven't been able to come up with something.
[03:06.950 --> 03:08.330]  It's just been haunting me.
[03:09.210 --> 03:13.790]  So are you able to come up with stuff and then you think like, no, that's not good enough.
[03:14.330 --> 03:18.030]  I got to come up with something better. Or are you just a blank? You're just a blank slate.
[03:18.230 --> 03:21.530]  It's like, yeah, it's sort of a mix of both where it's like, I'll come up with something
[03:21.530 --> 03:24.270]  and I'll think, well, that's not nearly interesting enough to share.
[03:24.490 --> 03:26.650]  I certainly know something more interesting than that.
[03:26.930 --> 03:30.450]  I think I immediately told him a great story about Peter Molyneux.
[03:30.830 --> 03:32.970]  That's like a great, but it's a video game, like trivia.
[03:33.310 --> 03:36.770]  Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I like that you're still thinking about it. I like that it's dwelling on you.
[03:37.150 --> 03:37.870]  Yes, it is.
[03:38.050 --> 03:41.030]  I feel like you asked me that question recently or something similar.
[03:41.110 --> 03:45.870]  And that's making me think that all I'm getting is recycled Gavin and Andrew conversations
[03:45.870 --> 03:49.990]  as Andrew and Geoff. I'm getting like sloppy seconds.
[03:49.990 --> 03:53.330]  I'm pretty sure Andrew asked me that question or something really similar the other day.
[03:53.550 --> 03:54.990]  I mean, I own the rights to that question.
[03:55.090 --> 03:57.150]  So I need royalties, Andrew, if you're asking other people.
[03:57.390 --> 03:58.530]  I don't feel like I did.
[03:58.770 --> 04:01.110]  Dude, it was that question or it was that question adjacent.
[04:01.290 --> 04:02.450]  I wish I could remember what it was.
[04:02.690 --> 04:04.850]  I think it was probably about entertainment carts.
[04:05.150 --> 04:06.290]  It's probably related to that.
[04:06.430 --> 04:06.970]  I don't think so.
[04:07.170 --> 04:07.670]  I'd assume.
[04:08.050 --> 04:09.690]  Why? I don't feel like I just asked you trivia.
[04:10.330 --> 04:11.070]  Why would I do that?
[04:11.590 --> 04:16.090]  I think he might be taking your ideas and passing them off as his own.
[04:17.090 --> 04:17.570]  That's fine.
[04:17.730 --> 04:19.870]  I mean, as long as it doesn't make its way back to me, then that's...
[04:19.990 --> 04:21.850]  perfectly valid path, isn't it?
[04:21.990 --> 04:22.330]  Fair enough.
[04:22.510 --> 04:22.930]  It is.
[04:23.730 --> 04:25.970]  But you asked me, Gavin, like two weeks.
[04:26.230 --> 04:26.490]  Two weeks.
[04:26.630 --> 04:27.130]  How many?
[04:27.470 --> 04:28.590]  The episode just came out.
[04:29.130 --> 04:31.850]  We had the whole anal fissure moment.
[04:32.090 --> 04:32.290]  Yeah.
[04:32.770 --> 04:33.210]  Where I denied it.
[04:33.210 --> 04:36.250]  It sounded like you were about to say we had the whole Jenna Fisher moment.
[04:37.710 --> 04:39.390]  Yeah, we had the anal fissure moment.
[04:39.470 --> 04:41.210]  Then we had the anal trenches following that.
[04:41.370 --> 04:42.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:42.210 --> 04:44.570]  There's going to be some anal adjacent topics.
[04:44.590 --> 04:44.970]  Oh, okay.
[04:45.410 --> 04:46.810]  We just can't escape your anus.
[04:47.230 --> 04:48.610]  No, well, it's not about it.
[04:48.750 --> 04:49.870]  We've gone past that.
[04:50.330 --> 04:55.790]  But you asked me that, and I was thinking about why can't I remember those things?
[04:55.890 --> 04:58.190]  Because outside of this, I've got a pretty good memory.
[04:58.630 --> 04:59.610]  Yeah, but how do you know, though?
[05:00.050 --> 05:01.850]  How does anyone know if their memory is good?
[05:02.210 --> 05:07.230]  Well, because when I have conversations with people, I'm often pretty good at mentioning
[05:07.230 --> 05:08.210]  a thing that they forgot.
[05:08.610 --> 05:11.230]  And then they'll be like, ah, I forgot about that.
[05:11.410 --> 05:16.850]  But anyway, I was thinking about it, and the first thing I want to say is just unfair,
[05:16.930 --> 05:18.490]  because you re-listened to the episodes.
[05:18.490 --> 05:20.610]  I've never listened to an episode of this show.
[05:20.710 --> 05:21.350]  You give notes.
[05:21.550 --> 05:24.150]  But I don't understand how... because you also give notes.
[05:24.750 --> 05:25.640]  And I was getting...
[05:26.810 --> 05:28.310]  When have I given a note?
[05:28.710 --> 05:30.430]  I'll say, like, post edits.
[05:30.910 --> 05:37.010]  That's my point, is that I always listen to them and give notes, because I just feel like
[05:37.010 --> 05:37.850]  someone should listen to them.
[05:38.230 --> 05:41.570]  But then you have given notes, but you give them in secret.
[05:41.570 --> 05:50.210]  I put them in the thread of the episode, but there will be notes given that never pass
[05:50.210 --> 05:50.870]  under our eyes.
[05:50.970 --> 05:52.790]  And you were giving me grief about that last week.
[05:52.890 --> 05:54.430]  Dude, Gavin, check the Discord.
[05:54.890 --> 05:56.990]  Nick is putting Andrew on blast.
[05:57.430 --> 05:58.830]  He says that's true.
[05:59.610 --> 06:01.310]  He messages me directly.
[06:01.510 --> 06:05.310]  So we don't even know what you're doing to the episodes, and you're even listening to
[06:05.310 --> 06:05.450]  them.
[06:06.230 --> 06:08.670]  Well, they're all things that I think of in the time.
[06:08.750 --> 06:10.570]  I've maybe done it twice, Nick.
[06:11.210 --> 06:12.350]  If you could back that.
[06:12.470 --> 06:13.890]  Maybe three times at most.
[06:14.010 --> 06:14.830]  Uh-oh, here we go.
[06:14.890 --> 06:15.550]  Yeah, two times.
[06:15.550 --> 06:18.930]  I've done it two times, and they're both times where I was concerned that somebody could
[06:18.930 --> 06:22.050]  be offended by what was said, or just being mindful of it.
[06:22.230 --> 06:23.770]  Yeah, a valid reason for a note.
[06:24.670 --> 06:25.470]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:25.830 --> 06:31.950]  But I think one of the main reasons why I'm so forgetful in these is, are you comfortable
[06:31.950 --> 06:32.370]  right now?
[06:32.450 --> 06:35.050]  How do you feel as far as just talking?
[06:35.510 --> 06:36.750]  Are you asking me that question?
[06:36.870 --> 06:38.030]  Yeah, I'm asking you that question.
[06:38.290 --> 06:39.610]  Do I feel comfortable talking?
[06:39.850 --> 06:40.490]  Yeah, right now.
[06:40.490 --> 06:41.070]  How do you feel?
[06:41.290 --> 06:41.870]  Do you feel good?
[06:42.150 --> 06:44.090]  Is this about to blow up in my face again?
[06:44.230 --> 06:45.450]  It's a trick question, dude.
[06:45.450 --> 06:46.310]  Don't answer it.
[06:46.590 --> 06:48.010]  There's not a trick question at all.
[06:48.290 --> 06:49.530]  Don't walk into this.
[06:49.650 --> 06:51.110]  That's a dangerous question, Andrew.
[06:51.270 --> 06:52.250]  How is it dangerous?
[06:52.470 --> 06:57.170]  That's, to me, you asked that question, but all I saw was you saying, hey, stand on this
[06:57.170 --> 06:57.690]  trap door.
[06:57.990 --> 06:58.450]  No, no, no.
[06:58.490 --> 07:01.550]  Okay, well, I'll just say from my perspective, I'm terrified right now.
[07:01.590 --> 07:02.070]  And I was talking.
[07:02.710 --> 07:03.510]  This is terrifying.
[07:03.870 --> 07:06.570]  Yeah, like the social, like with my anxieties and stuff.
[07:06.570 --> 07:09.090]  Yeah, it's super scary to record this.
[07:09.150 --> 07:12.090]  And then, like, just the concept of anyone listening to it.
[07:12.250 --> 07:13.970]  I can't even really wrap my head around.
[07:14.130 --> 07:15.030]  It's a very odd thing.
[07:15.130 --> 07:19.250]  I've been nervous ever since I found out that Geoff was lying about how many people listen to him.
[07:19.930 --> 07:20.890]  Are you serious, Gavin?
[07:21.190 --> 07:21.610]  Well, I do.
[07:21.790 --> 07:24.170]  It's like, I just don't want it to get shitty.
[07:24.550 --> 07:25.290]  I don't want it to get downhill.
[07:25.650 --> 07:29.330]  I think lying is a strong word, first of all.
[07:29.810 --> 07:31.730]  I prefer to think that I was joshing.
[07:32.610 --> 07:34.890]  Yeah, I was joshing and then not giving me the update.
[07:35.150 --> 07:36.350]  It may have been more true at the time.
[07:36.570 --> 07:37.930]  Yeah, it's true.
[07:38.010 --> 07:40.730]  It was the withholding of important updates.
[07:41.050 --> 07:48.870]  Are you saying, Andrew, that 49 episodes in, you're just as nervous now as you were at episode one?
[07:49.010 --> 07:50.670]  I don't think... well, here's the weird thing.
[07:50.730 --> 07:54.910]  We recorded... maybe episode one is the most calm I've ever been in recording one of these
[07:54.910 --> 07:56.810]  because it just didn't feel like a thing.
[07:57.230 --> 07:57.690]  I don't know.
[07:57.750 --> 07:59.050]  Like, it didn't feel like a podcast.
[07:59.310 --> 08:02.350]  And then the second one, for some reason, felt more real.
[08:02.970 --> 08:06.190]  And then the night the first episode came out, I was sick.
[08:06.190 --> 08:08.850]  I was just so nauseous because I couldn't listen to it.
[08:09.410 --> 08:12.370]  And well, I could, but like, I just am incapable of listening to it.
[08:12.750 --> 08:17.150]  And I was terrified that we had made the worst podcast of all time.
[08:18.610 --> 08:20.310]  Jack and I just did that with Annual Pass.
[08:22.630 --> 08:24.710]  Nobody should start with episode one.
[08:24.850 --> 08:25.890]  Episode one isn't good.
[08:26.370 --> 08:28.010]  Nobody should start with any episode one.
[08:28.230 --> 08:28.350]  Yeah.
[08:28.710 --> 08:32.430]  I feel like episode one isn't... it isn't bad for like what...
[08:32.430 --> 08:34.690]  We did no prep for the launch.
[08:34.870 --> 08:35.910]  It just kind of happened.
[08:36.130 --> 08:37.410]  We recorded the first one.
[08:37.490 --> 08:39.870]  I didn't know how often we'd do it or how long it would be.
[08:39.930 --> 08:41.810]  I didn't find that out until after we had recorded.
[08:42.390 --> 08:44.410]  I didn't buy a mic for it until the day before.
[08:44.530 --> 08:46.210]  Like, it was just... it was a very quick process.
[08:46.410 --> 08:47.110]  But are you nervous?
[08:47.270 --> 08:49.830]  You're not freaking out before we record, though, right?
[08:49.910 --> 08:52.930]  Like, if it's just... if we're in the room on Discord just chatting?
[08:53.290 --> 08:54.250]  No, no, no.
[08:54.330 --> 08:57.270]  Not as... well, like, the whole day, I kind of have nerves about it.
[08:57.350 --> 08:58.190]  But like, yeah.
[08:58.470 --> 08:59.250]  Once we record...
[08:59.250 --> 09:01.750]  To me, it's still a day where on Wednesday night, I'm always like,
[09:01.750 --> 09:02.670]  I've got to get good sleep.
[09:02.810 --> 09:03.610]  I've got to get good sleep.
[09:03.670 --> 09:06.450]  I don't want to be awake all night and then do a shitty f*** face.
[09:06.530 --> 09:07.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[09:08.130 --> 09:13.950]  It is really interesting to me how much the recording of this podcast affects both of you in different ways.
[09:13.950 --> 09:14.350]  Does it not affect you?
[09:16.010 --> 09:18.190]  I feel like it affects you more afterwards.
[09:18.410 --> 09:20.450]  Like, you're hard on it after we've stopped.
[09:22.530 --> 09:24.570]  I'll be like, that was a fun time by the end.
[09:24.590 --> 09:27.530]  I was about to sit here and blow some
[09:27.530 --> 09:29.990]  I always wear socks with my shoes.
[09:30.090 --> 09:30.650]  Bulls***.
[09:31.030 --> 09:32.190]  Right up your asses.
[09:32.290 --> 09:34.330]  And that's an excellent f***ing point, Gavin.
[09:35.050 --> 09:40.650]  I do not tend to get nervous going into it because it just feels like catching up with you guys.
[09:40.910 --> 09:43.010]  But coming out of it, I'm a wreck.
[09:43.390 --> 09:43.790]  You're right.
[09:44.090 --> 09:44.590]  Sometimes jeering.
[09:46.850 --> 09:47.890]  Shut up.
[09:48.670 --> 09:50.870]  Yeah, but that's never you guys.
[09:50.970 --> 09:55.250]  That's always only because I catch a whiff of my performance.
[09:55.250 --> 10:05.690]  I try to ignore me and what I'm doing when I'm in the podcast and not focus too much on me because I don't like me.
[10:06.030 --> 10:07.770]  Right. And I would be distracted by me.
[10:08.210 --> 10:13.030]  And so and every once in a while you like you say something and then you hear it, you know, and you catch a whiff of it.
[10:13.170 --> 10:22.850]  Oh, you're so stupid and ugly and dumb and distasteful and not good and unattractive and stinky.
[10:22.850 --> 10:30.210]  You have a bad personality and you your heart smells, you know, and and then that throws me.
[10:30.470 --> 10:32.030]  So I try. But usually I'm good.
[10:32.110 --> 10:34.730]  Usually I have Geoff blinders on until we until we end.
[10:34.830 --> 10:41.190]  It's so funny you mentioned that because I talked to Gavin once before, maybe nine episodes, 11 episodes ago at this point.
[10:41.250 --> 10:46.770]  Maybe not that far, but a long time ago we're recording and Gavin asked me how my desk was.
[10:46.810 --> 10:47.790]  What did my desk look like?
[10:47.830 --> 10:48.930]  Like, was it tidy or not?
[10:49.330 --> 10:50.970]  And I just said, yeah, it's relatively clean.
[10:51.470 --> 10:52.250]  I did nothing.
[10:52.250 --> 10:53.190]  I added nothing.
[10:53.390 --> 10:57.290]  Like it was very clearly Gav was passing me the ball and I did absolutely nothing with it.
[10:57.590 --> 10:59.410]  And it's a moment nobody else would remember.
[10:59.710 --> 11:02.990]  But I've been beating myself up about it for like nine weeks straight.
[11:03.010 --> 11:04.990]  I constantly think about it.
[11:05.090 --> 11:06.070]  To me, that didn't register.
[11:06.190 --> 11:07.010]  Like, I don't even remember that.
[11:07.550 --> 11:09.670]  It wasn't even like you dropped the ball by the sounds of it.
[11:09.730 --> 11:11.890]  You just caught the ball and gently put it down.
[11:12.290 --> 11:14.590]  Yeah, like it's just I contributed nothing.
[11:14.590 --> 11:18.410]  Like you guys had a really good back and forth going and it was like me very clear.
[11:18.490 --> 11:20.410]  Like, Andrew, let's put you in this conversation.
[11:20.410 --> 11:22.630]  I was like, thanks, I'm going to do nothing.
[11:22.770 --> 11:24.010]  I'm just going to sit with this ball.
[11:25.330 --> 11:28.190]  Yeah, so it's funny you mentioned that, Geoff, because it's like that's that's
[11:28.190 --> 11:30.370]  the thing where nobody remembers that moment but me.
[11:30.490 --> 11:31.290]  But it's been in my head.
[11:31.370 --> 11:32.710]  What episode was that even in?
[11:32.770 --> 11:34.110]  No clue, but it was.
[11:35.250 --> 11:36.390]  This is great.
[11:36.610 --> 11:38.550]  This is a great this is a great conversation to have.
[11:38.630 --> 11:39.530]  I'm glad we're doing this.
[11:40.070 --> 11:41.670]  Is there anything like that with you, Gav?
[11:41.710 --> 11:47.230]  Do you have moments of like personal regret or failure in the podcast or things like that
[11:47.230 --> 11:48.950]  that just irk you you've done?
[11:49.410 --> 11:53.850]  Yeah, because I feel like a lot of the time some of the more spontaneous stuff is funny
[11:54.230 --> 11:58.690]  and and the stuff that I write down in the week, if I bring it up and it isn't funny,
[11:58.810 --> 12:00.290]  I'm just like, why did I even write that down?
[12:00.430 --> 12:04.050]  Like, looking back and I'm like, what was I even did I miss some of the story?
[12:04.170 --> 12:06.190]  Like, why didn't that do anything on the podcast?
[12:06.190 --> 12:08.650]  Yeah, but I know I know what you mean.
[12:08.670 --> 12:11.330]  Like, when you think the story is going to hit harder than it does.
[12:11.810 --> 12:14.450]  Yeah, well, not even having the expectation that will hit.
[12:14.450 --> 12:19.990]  But just like, I sometimes realize mid telling it, I don't know why I've written this.
[12:20.130 --> 12:23.410]  And then I think that makes I think that affects the telling of the story
[12:23.410 --> 12:24.910]  because I lose confidence in it.
[12:25.290 --> 12:29.970]  Do you ever think like, I'm doing a bad job telling this story and I wish I could do better?
[12:30.230 --> 12:31.630]  Like, it's not the story's fault, it's me.
[12:31.850 --> 12:36.230]  Yeah, but what I do is I take that thought and I postpone it.
[12:36.550 --> 12:40.470]  And I try not to let it affect the current moment or the rest of the podcast.
[12:40.590 --> 12:44.130]  Otherwise, I'll just be thinking about it like the rest of the 40 minutes that we're doing it.
[12:44.130 --> 12:47.750]  So I'm pretty good at just like, bagging it and bidding it and just moving on.
[12:47.830 --> 12:50.190]  Yeah, I would say I have I have two of those.
[12:50.390 --> 12:59.750]  I have one, there are, I'm unfortunately more than a few times I have been so in my head trying to
[12:59.750 --> 13:05.190]  like, get ready to tell a story or think about the way I want to say it that I realize I'm gone.
[13:05.390 --> 13:07.150]  And you guys are so far down the road.
[13:07.210 --> 13:09.550]  And I just come back into it. You guys are laughing.
[13:09.550 --> 13:14.770]  You know, and I'll go, oh, man, I have no idea where we are at that point.
[13:14.910 --> 13:17.430]  And I always, I always hate myself when that happens.
[13:18.230 --> 13:21.090]  It's like podcast therapy. I like it when it gets called out as well.
[13:21.210 --> 13:24.630]  Sometimes Andrew will be or Eric will be like, well, Geoff had nothing to say.
[13:25.030 --> 13:25.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:25.870 --> 13:29.090]  The Geoff had nothing, silence for five minutes.
[13:29.170 --> 13:32.150]  I'm like, oh, yeah, no, that's totally true. You guys caught me.
[13:32.530 --> 13:37.150]  I want to know if Eric gets these thoughts or whether he's just so,
[13:37.770 --> 13:40.510]  you know, listening in the background producer that he doesn't have to worry.
[13:41.590 --> 13:48.290]  I don't know that I think to the degree that you guys have just explained, like Andrew saying
[13:48.290 --> 13:51.690]  that he was nervous when it was coming out and stuff like that.
[13:51.870 --> 13:54.630]  I want people to like these things that we work on.
[13:54.850 --> 13:59.630]  But also, I think that they're sort of like almost like ephemeral.
[13:59.990 --> 14:01.410]  Like, do you feel that way?
[14:01.510 --> 14:05.290]  Like, do you have these feelings, Gavin, when you when you're on the Rooster Teeth podcast?
[14:05.770 --> 14:06.830]  In a different way.
[14:07.050 --> 14:07.830]  How so?
[14:08.090 --> 14:11.190]  I don't know, just it's different vibe, isn't it? Like, it's not always the same crew.
[14:11.450 --> 14:15.050]  It's I feel like there's more people. So there's different amounts of pressure.
[14:15.230 --> 14:16.450]  I don't know. It's hard to explain.
[14:16.790 --> 14:23.350]  I feel I feel like with this show, if you have a story that you think is a real banger,
[14:23.830 --> 14:30.790]  that is when you get kind of like butterflies about it because you want it to be as big
[14:30.790 --> 14:33.970]  as it can possibly be to kill as hard as it can.
[14:33.970 --> 14:36.930]  And there's nothing worse than when that doesn't happen.
[14:37.190 --> 14:45.710]  I will tell you, I thought I had a horse falling off a mountain story last week in my head
[14:45.710 --> 14:51.150]  that was A++++. And I think I told us maybe a B- story.
[14:51.550 --> 14:53.030]  No, that was an A?
[14:53.150 --> 14:58.750]  No, it wasn't. No, no, no. That story was good. It was an OK story. It was an OK story.
[14:59.150 --> 15:01.590]  It was fine. It's not as good as what happened.
[15:01.590 --> 15:05.690]  And I wish I could I wish I could time machine and go back and retell the story
[15:05.690 --> 15:07.270]  because I could have done a way better job.
[15:07.390 --> 15:10.510]  I listened to it in the car this morning. I was talking about this earlier, Gav.
[15:10.530 --> 15:15.450]  I listened to it in the car this morning on the way back from set because Eric and I are
[15:15.450 --> 15:18.010]  in like a big tentpole show that was filming overnight.
[15:18.650 --> 15:20.970]  By the way, an hour out of town, which is also awesome.
[15:22.090 --> 15:25.110]  And although I'm not one, I should not complain because Eric had it way worse than I did.
[15:26.190 --> 15:30.630]  But I was listening to it on the way home and I was fucking bummed out.
[15:30.630 --> 15:33.550]  As a matter of fact, I was going to stop on the way home
[15:33.550 --> 15:36.750]  and get myself an iced coffee from the Starbucks by my house.
[15:37.210 --> 15:42.250]  And I this is I I forbade myself.
[15:42.510 --> 15:47.590]  I don't deserve it. Yeah, I took my treat away because I said you did.
[15:47.710 --> 15:49.830]  You did such a piss poor job.
[15:50.070 --> 15:55.050]  You did such a fucking B minus job with that story that you don't deserve
[15:55.050 --> 15:57.910]  your venti iced coffee black from Starbucks.
[15:57.910 --> 16:01.170]  You certainly don't deserve your grande cold brew.
[16:01.930 --> 16:03.250]  And so I didn't get either.
[16:03.350 --> 16:08.490]  I went home printing out forms when we finished these podcasts and filling out surveys for
[16:08.490 --> 16:10.670]  ourselves. We need to do I didn't realize we all took it.
[16:10.850 --> 16:13.330]  So, yeah, we need to do like reverse highlight reels.
[16:13.530 --> 16:16.310]  You know, like in sports where it's like they talk about why the play went well,
[16:16.350 --> 16:19.770]  but it's just us analyzing every way we failed in the telling of the story.
[16:20.490 --> 16:21.930]  We'll break down of this failure.
[16:22.110 --> 16:25.990]  I think what it is is I think that this one is I think it's because we're
[16:26.490 --> 16:29.050]  it's so wrapped up in our friendship.
[16:30.110 --> 16:35.930]  And I, you know, I really like I think this the strength of a lot of the history of Rooster Teeth
[16:35.930 --> 16:38.850]  is that it really is friends trying to make friends laugh.
[16:38.970 --> 16:41.970]  And I care more about making you guys laugh than just about anybody.
[16:42.190 --> 16:45.570]  And so I do I, you know, I try harder in this show than other shows.
[16:45.570 --> 16:47.630]  Not that I don't try hard and other stuff I do.
[16:47.750 --> 16:51.730]  But, you know, there's a there is a little more like I want to hold myself to us.
[16:51.970 --> 16:54.390]  I want to be as funny as you guys, if that makes sense.
[16:54.390 --> 16:57.750]  Do you think there's a group of friends somewhere where none of them are funny?
[16:58.950 --> 17:02.370]  I think I think I think there's a lot of groups of friends that think they're funny.
[17:02.770 --> 17:05.110]  I wonder if there's just like a group of close friends
[17:05.110 --> 17:07.190]  who just never laugh and never have a good time.
[17:07.390 --> 17:08.230]  And oh, yeah.
[17:08.430 --> 17:10.110]  Do you just disband the friendship?
[17:10.490 --> 17:13.670]  You're just like, shit, I guess we're not like we're not friends.
[17:14.010 --> 17:15.070]  Well, how would that even work?
[17:15.430 --> 17:19.670]  I think there are people that just aren't humor is not as big a deal to them.
[17:20.270 --> 17:21.450]  Maybe, you know what I mean?
[17:21.450 --> 17:22.530]  Like more serious people.
[17:22.990 --> 17:23.550]  I wonder what that's like.
[17:23.550 --> 17:25.130]  It's fucking boring.
[17:26.110 --> 17:27.450]  I'll tell you what it's not like.
[17:27.650 --> 17:31.330]  It's not like setting off fire extinguishers in your closet to hide,
[17:31.470 --> 17:33.190]  you know, fucking burning hot dogs.
[17:33.410 --> 17:33.790]  Sure, it's not.
[17:34.510 --> 17:35.830]  It's coming up, isn't it?
[17:35.830 --> 17:38.110]  The big the big puff of the fire.
[17:38.370 --> 17:38.910]  I'm looking into it.
[17:38.930 --> 17:42.690]  People are talking about how I could suffocate because of the fumes or something like there
[17:42.690 --> 17:44.750]  seems to be a lot of a lot of health risk.
[17:44.870 --> 17:48.150]  I mean, I have I have a plan in my head that I just need to.
[17:48.370 --> 17:51.190]  I need to like figure out and like just plan.
[17:51.190 --> 17:55.710]  I mean, carbon dioxide will I guess you could potentially suffocate, but just open a window.
[17:55.990 --> 18:00.230]  Well, I can't do that because it's going to shoot up like I need to kind of zone off the idea.
[18:00.530 --> 18:01.930]  What kind of fire extinguisher is it?
[18:01.930 --> 18:03.510]  Is it the foam or is it the powder?
[18:03.630 --> 18:04.770]  Is it the CO2?
[18:04.870 --> 18:05.750]  I've got no idea.
[18:05.850 --> 18:07.510]  I don't I'm not even really sure how to tell.
[18:08.150 --> 18:11.410]  It just it would say because some of them you're not supposed to use on life.
[18:11.510 --> 18:12.010]  It's water.
[18:12.330 --> 18:12.770]  It's important.
[18:12.890 --> 18:15.570]  You don't spray on like dry chemical fire electricity.
[18:15.970 --> 18:17.170]  I don't know if it's probably powder.
[18:17.270 --> 18:18.110]  Yeah, I'd assume powder.
[18:18.390 --> 18:19.270]  That's probably the worst one.
[18:19.350 --> 18:19.570]  Probably.
[18:19.670 --> 18:20.550]  Don't put it in your mouth.
[18:20.550 --> 18:20.950]  No.
[18:23.370 --> 18:26.910]  It's interesting to hear, like, all your reactions, because it's curious
[18:27.490 --> 18:33.670]  because I did I did stand up once, and that's the most scared I've ever been doing anything.
[18:34.070 --> 18:34.970]  And that was...
[18:34.970 --> 18:35.390]  How did it go?
[18:36.610 --> 18:37.770]  Well, it was a full process.
[18:37.890 --> 18:39.150]  I never planned on doing it.
[18:39.270 --> 18:43.770]  Geoff went through I don't know if it's fair to call it a phase or if you're still really into it.
[18:43.790 --> 18:45.630]  But at that time, you're really into stand up.
[18:45.890 --> 18:46.030]  No.
[18:46.130 --> 18:48.310]  OK, first of all, it wasn't a phase.
[18:48.310 --> 18:53.710]  Uh, I'm not a teenager trying to figure out what I'm doing, who I am in the world.
[18:54.270 --> 18:58.450]  Uh, it wasn't my heavy metal phase or anything like that.
[18:59.070 --> 19:03.170]  Uh, secondly, I would like to get into this, too, because in the pre show that we have
[19:03.170 --> 19:07.010]  before you show up, Gavin, when we're just arguing and trying to have a real conversation,
[19:07.730 --> 19:10.250]  Andrew told me that I am a liar.
[19:10.290 --> 19:12.350]  Guys, he accused me of being a liar.
[19:12.410 --> 19:12.870]  Geoff lied to me.
[19:12.890 --> 19:14.590]  About this stand up performance.
[19:15.170 --> 19:17.330]  And I and secondly, it wasn't a phase.
[19:17.330 --> 19:20.170]  The way it worked is I have a friend.
[19:20.290 --> 19:25.770]  We have a friend named Nick Scarpino who does stand up and he he's in the in this industry
[19:25.770 --> 19:26.110]  with us.
[19:26.210 --> 19:28.850]  And I was fascinated by his journey through stand up.
[19:28.930 --> 19:33.530]  So I convinced Rooster Teeth to make a documentary following him around on his journey as a San
[19:33.530 --> 19:38.070]  Francisco stand up comedian who also has a successful day job as a podcast comedian.
[19:38.450 --> 19:38.670]  Right.
[19:38.710 --> 19:43.750]  But he doesn't he doesn't let the two intertwine, even though he could and make a lot of shortcuts.
[19:43.750 --> 19:46.890]  I thought that was a really cool work ethic and really interesting.
[19:47.030 --> 19:51.710]  And he wanted to come up the way the comedians that he looked up to as a kid did and kind
[19:51.710 --> 19:55.090]  of follow in their footsteps in the real on the real path of a comedian.
[19:55.390 --> 19:56.930]  And so we made that documentary.
[19:57.170 --> 20:03.310]  But as a part of that, I had I was required to do stand up and I caught the bug and I
[20:03.310 --> 20:04.190]  did it for about a year.
[20:04.450 --> 20:06.210]  And I thought Andrew would be great at it.
[20:06.210 --> 20:08.150]  So I encouraged my friend to do stand up as well.
[20:08.210 --> 20:10.610]  And he did a fantastic job.
[20:10.610 --> 20:15.910]  Well, OK, so from my perspective, and I didn't mean a phase like a high school thing.
[20:15.970 --> 20:19.470]  I just meant at that time, you and I, when we talk, we would mainly talk about stand
[20:19.470 --> 20:19.650]  up.
[20:19.730 --> 20:22.590]  And it was the thing you're really passionate about and interested in.
[20:22.630 --> 20:23.930]  We just talked about it more at that time.
[20:24.730 --> 20:26.690]  Well, I was just getting I was getting ready for the doc.
[20:26.690 --> 20:26.910]  Sure.
[20:27.030 --> 20:27.370]  Yeah.
[20:27.710 --> 20:32.290]  But so just me being being a friend to you, you had just written a set.
[20:32.370 --> 20:33.850]  And I thought, well, I've never done that.
[20:33.890 --> 20:34.870]  I've never considered it.
[20:34.890 --> 20:36.850]  I'm not really interested in ever doing stand up.
[20:36.850 --> 20:39.730]  But I would like to know what that process is like.
[20:39.730 --> 20:41.830]  So I tried to do it and I talked to you about it.
[20:42.050 --> 20:46.510]  And then you were going to do a it was like a stand up event at RTX.
[20:47.010 --> 20:48.670]  And you invited me to do it.
[20:48.970 --> 20:51.310]  And I kind of have a moral rule.
[20:51.350 --> 20:55.530]  I don't know if moral is the right word, but the personal rule, like a policy of if there's
[20:55.530 --> 20:59.670]  something offered to me and the only thing preventing me from doing it or wanting to
[20:59.670 --> 21:02.030]  say yes is fear, then I do it anyway.
[21:02.530 --> 21:03.470]  I'm not perfect at this.
[21:03.490 --> 21:05.090]  So you're like a fear yes man?
[21:05.090 --> 21:05.750]  Sort of, yeah.
[21:06.690 --> 21:08.670]  Obviously, sometimes I fail at that.
[21:08.670 --> 21:12.290]  There are times where I've said no to a thing where it was probably mainly fear based, but
[21:12.290 --> 21:16.670]  I generally have been pretty good at always saying yes to those chances and stand up
[21:16.670 --> 21:17.350]  was one of them.
[21:18.070 --> 21:19.510]  And so it was terrifying.
[21:19.950 --> 21:22.710]  Also, Geoff never confirmed if I was on it or not.
[21:22.810 --> 21:25.310]  He's like, hey, if you want to do this, you can.
[21:25.430 --> 21:26.210]  And I said, I'm not sure.
[21:26.250 --> 21:27.070]  I got to think about it.
[21:27.410 --> 21:28.910]  And then I said, yeah, I think I'll do it.
[21:28.950 --> 21:30.910]  And then Geoff never acknowledged that in any way.
[21:31.050 --> 21:35.810]  So I wasn't sure if I was on or not until the tickets went up for sale and I was listed
[21:36.410 --> 21:38.170]  with the people that were doing it.
[21:38.170 --> 21:40.230]  Look, I'm not running the fucking show.
[21:40.370 --> 21:41.370]  I'm just making the connection.
[21:41.570 --> 21:41.750]  Sure.
[21:42.150 --> 21:43.470]  Yeah, I just I wasn't sure.
[21:43.770 --> 21:48.110]  But then also, like, because I have crazy anxiety brain, I went through this prep.
[21:48.230 --> 21:52.430]  I remember, I think it was George St. Pierre, who's an MMA fighter, had this quote once
[21:52.430 --> 21:55.470]  that he liked to, like, run in the snow when he trained.
[21:55.850 --> 21:58.790]  Like, it was his favorite thing to do because the movement was so much harder that when
[21:58.790 --> 22:01.830]  he got into the cage to fight, it was easier.
[22:01.930 --> 22:02.650]  Like, it was nothing.
[22:03.210 --> 22:05.790]  So I took this to, like, I tried to do my version of that.
[22:05.790 --> 22:10.710]  So, like, I do my set in the shower and I just blast my face with water the entire time.
[22:10.790 --> 22:12.110]  Like, I was trying to do whatever I could.
[22:13.230 --> 22:15.850]  So you're like, on the day, there won't be any water.
[22:16.590 --> 22:21.090]  I was just trying to do anything to be annoying or make it harder for myself because I assumed
[22:21.090 --> 22:26.530]  if I could do it in those scenario, in that setting, then it would be easy for me to do.
[22:26.650 --> 22:28.630]  I was nervous about how I hold the microphone.
[22:28.790 --> 22:30.770]  I bought a rock band mic and I just hold it.
[22:30.830 --> 22:32.630]  Like, I was just I was freaking out about it.
[22:32.710 --> 22:33.270]  I have anxiety.
[22:33.270 --> 22:36.590]  You were like, if I could do it in front of running water,
[22:37.210 --> 22:39.030]  250 people are going to be a breeze.
[22:39.090 --> 22:39.690]  No, I didn't.
[22:39.770 --> 22:39.950]  Yeah.
[22:40.030 --> 22:41.990]  Let the altitude training stand up.
[22:42.150 --> 22:42.510]  Exactly.
[22:42.790 --> 22:43.850]  That was sort of my mindset.
[22:44.070 --> 22:47.390]  So I did that every single day for weeks.
[22:47.610 --> 22:50.730]  And I had the set written down on my computer and I had on my tablet.
[22:51.310 --> 22:53.770]  And then the day of, I just had a complete panic attack.
[22:53.830 --> 22:54.810]  And I spent the entire day.
[22:54.850 --> 22:55.650]  It was an RTX day.
[22:55.950 --> 22:59.750]  I just spent the whole day in my place, rewriting everything I'd written before.
[23:00.130 --> 23:01.370]  And just trying to change things.
[23:01.570 --> 23:02.810]  I had a panic attack.
[23:02.810 --> 23:04.150]  So I had a bath and I could...
[23:04.150 --> 23:05.190]  You're freaking me out.
[23:05.250 --> 23:06.410]  Just telling the story.
[23:08.030 --> 23:10.450]  I'm getting like secondhand anxiety.
[23:10.610 --> 23:15.950]  I was so, Gavin, I was so nervous that I had a bath because I was just having just extreme anxiety.
[23:16.290 --> 23:18.470]  And I couldn't figure out how to drain the water.
[23:18.590 --> 23:20.270]  Like I couldn't make like I tried lifting.
[23:20.390 --> 23:20.870]  It wouldn't work.
[23:20.930 --> 23:21.510]  I tried twisting.
[23:21.730 --> 23:26.110]  I tried all the mechanisms I was aware of for lifting a drain and none of them would work.
[23:26.250 --> 23:27.710]  And I was staying with four people.
[23:27.710 --> 23:29.850]  So I couldn't just like leave a bath full of water.
[23:29.850 --> 23:32.910]  So my solution was I drained it via popcorn bucket.
[23:33.230 --> 23:34.670]  I just scooped the whole thing out.
[23:34.670 --> 23:37.210]  Because I thought, well, somebody else will figure out how to lift it.
[23:37.650 --> 23:38.510]  Because someone will have a shower.
[23:38.830 --> 23:39.150]  You like...
[23:41.590 --> 23:42.910]  That would be like...
[23:42.910 --> 23:45.990]  I would resort to that if I couldn't drain it for like half an hour.
[23:46.490 --> 23:48.430]  I imagine you like you can't drain it for like two minutes.
[23:48.530 --> 23:49.710]  You're like gonna have to bail it out.
[23:49.730 --> 23:50.230]  It was probably...
[23:50.230 --> 23:51.290]  Like a sinking ship.
[23:51.330 --> 23:52.450]  It was probably 10 minutes.
[23:52.530 --> 23:56.590]  But this is in the midst of me having extreme anxiety about having to perform later.
[23:57.230 --> 23:57.970]  And just like...
[23:57.970 --> 23:58.870]  You're like, I don't have time for this.
[23:59.350 --> 24:00.170]  That is...
[24:00.710 --> 24:02.110]  That was the thought I had.
[24:02.710 --> 24:04.730]  I can't make the stand-up special.
[24:06.450 --> 24:08.390]  Bath tub won't drain fast enough.
[24:08.870 --> 24:10.230]  So I got a popcorn bucket.
[24:10.310 --> 24:12.570]  It took like, I don't know, 75 or so.
[24:12.590 --> 24:13.970]  But I remember counting each one.
[24:15.070 --> 24:18.830]  And it was like really handy where I could like drop down,
[24:19.170 --> 24:20.510]  scoop the bucket, and twist.
[24:20.630 --> 24:21.570]  And the sink was right there.
[24:21.630 --> 24:22.650]  So it was like pretty fast.
[24:24.030 --> 24:25.350]  So I drained the tub.
[24:25.810 --> 24:27.830]  And my logic was somebody's gonna have a shower.
[24:27.830 --> 24:28.850]  And it's gonna fill.
[24:28.990 --> 24:29.910]  And then they'll figure it out.
[24:30.510 --> 24:32.210]  I can't solve this at this time.
[24:33.290 --> 24:34.350]  So then we go.
[24:34.450 --> 24:35.230]  I go to the show.
[24:35.610 --> 24:38.950]  And I realized that I've written my set on my tablet and my computer.
[24:39.170 --> 24:41.270]  I don't have a copy of it on me at all.
[24:41.610 --> 24:43.170]  I just never considered that.
[24:43.670 --> 24:44.910]  And so I get there.
[24:45.110 --> 24:48.250]  And within, I don't know, maybe 10 seconds of walking in the door,
[24:48.330 --> 24:51.370]  I can't think of a single word of my set that I've been working on.
[24:51.450 --> 24:53.170]  And I've been changing it all day.
[24:53.410 --> 24:55.490]  So I'm meeting people I've never met before.
[24:55.490 --> 24:57.590]  That venue is so hot.
[24:57.730 --> 24:58.750]  It's in the middle of summer.
[24:59.250 --> 25:00.770]  I'm just drenched in sweat.
[25:00.870 --> 25:01.550]  And I'm meeting people.
[25:01.990 --> 25:03.590]  And I'm just trying to remember my set.
[25:03.710 --> 25:04.570]  And I can't do it.
[25:04.630 --> 25:05.050]  No matter what.
[25:05.650 --> 25:06.790]  There's a block there.
[25:07.230 --> 25:08.130]  And I'm just panicking.
[25:08.710 --> 25:11.750]  And every time someone like Matt Bragg came and said hi.
[25:11.910 --> 25:13.410]  And I was just like, I can't remember my set.
[25:13.510 --> 25:14.570]  And he's like, you'll be fine.
[25:15.070 --> 25:16.270]  And I told you, Geoff.
[25:16.750 --> 25:18.330]  I was like, man, I can't remember anything.
[25:18.450 --> 25:19.990]  And I don't even have a copy of my set.
[25:20.110 --> 25:21.290]  And you said, don't worry about it.
[25:21.470 --> 25:22.470]  This happened to me.
[25:22.870 --> 25:24.790]  It all comes back right before you perform.
[25:24.790 --> 25:28.170]  And I was like, OK, I'm not sure about that.
[25:28.270 --> 25:29.690]  But I'm going to just keep trying.
[25:29.750 --> 25:30.970]  Because I don't know what else to do.
[25:31.130 --> 25:33.070]  And I was in the middle of the show.
[25:33.150 --> 25:36.030]  So as each person is finishing their set, I'm getting more and more nervous.
[25:36.030 --> 25:37.290]  Because I can't think of anything.
[25:37.970 --> 25:39.310]  And then Geoff is going to go on.
[25:40.270 --> 25:43.310]  Or no, Geoff, you went on last.
[25:43.530 --> 25:46.110]  So anyway, a bunch of time passed.
[25:46.810 --> 25:49.430]  I think it was I was about to go on.
[25:49.530 --> 25:50.750]  I was the next person to go on.
[25:51.090 --> 25:53.150]  And I'm sitting in this room by myself.
[25:53.150 --> 25:54.750]  Everyone else is watching people perform.
[25:54.950 --> 25:58.110]  I'm just freaking out in the back, trying to remember my set.
[25:58.770 --> 26:00.030]  And Geoff walks back there.
[26:00.550 --> 26:02.350]  And he takes this huge sigh.
[26:02.570 --> 26:04.130]  And then he sits down in a chair.
[26:04.230 --> 26:06.230]  And he puts his head between his legs.
[26:06.390 --> 26:08.630]  And then he arches back up and looks to the sky.
[26:08.950 --> 26:11.010]  And says, I can't remember a fucking thing.
[26:12.630 --> 26:14.130]  And I was like, you motherfucker.
[26:14.250 --> 26:15.390]  You told me that I'll come back.
[26:15.630 --> 26:16.770]  I have nothing to worry about.
[26:16.970 --> 26:20.530]  And you're having a moment of panic right in front of me.
[26:21.210 --> 26:24.750]  You're like, according to my schedule, everything should be coming back right now.
[26:25.870 --> 26:27.830]  But he didn't mean it that way.
[26:27.970 --> 26:31.750]  But he very clearly was trying to supportively lie to me to calm me down.
[26:32.050 --> 26:34.370]  And then he did that two performances later.
[26:34.470 --> 26:35.610]  Just right in front of me.
[26:36.270 --> 26:37.510]  I can't remember shit.
[26:39.310 --> 26:39.750]  So...
[26:39.750 --> 26:42.190]  Yeah, I was lying to you.
[26:42.470 --> 26:44.170]  Yeah, absolutely, 100%.
[26:44.170 --> 26:45.710]  You got me, you got me.
[26:46.370 --> 26:47.090]  So then I...
[26:47.090 --> 26:48.230]  Yeah, dude, stand up.
[26:48.290 --> 26:49.050]  Stand up is stressful.
[26:49.050 --> 26:50.730]  Oh, it's terrifying.
[26:51.830 --> 26:54.090]  I couldn't do it. That sounds awful.
[26:54.430 --> 26:55.610]  I'm freaking out just listening to it.
[26:55.610 --> 26:57.350]  Yeah, I never remembered my set.
[26:57.690 --> 27:02.130]  Like, they said my name and I remember walking to the stage and standing there.
[27:02.610 --> 27:04.510]  And the Geoff moment never happened.
[27:04.830 --> 27:06.310]  It never came back.
[27:06.470 --> 27:07.550]  And I just stared.
[27:07.670 --> 27:08.930]  I looked at everybody for a minute.
[27:09.150 --> 27:11.430]  And I thought, wow, I need to say something.
[27:11.930 --> 27:14.270]  Like, there's nobody can say anything to get me out of this.
[27:14.730 --> 27:16.930]  So I think I just acknowledged that I couldn't remember anything.
[27:16.930 --> 27:21.470]  And then I remembered like one or two jokes from my set and I pivoted and it went fine.
[27:21.510 --> 27:23.010]  But I have no memory of that performance.
[27:23.330 --> 27:24.270]  Yeah, I think, I don't know.
[27:24.330 --> 27:25.510]  I don't remember anything.
[27:25.690 --> 27:27.570]  I remember walking on the stage and walking.
[27:27.610 --> 27:31.750]  You didn't do about half of your set, but the half you did was hilarious.
[27:32.150 --> 27:34.350]  You killed and everybody thought you were hilarious.
[27:34.650 --> 27:35.070]  Yeah, I don't.
[27:35.190 --> 27:37.490]  And you looked so comfortable up there.
[27:37.630 --> 27:38.930]  It didn't come across.
[27:39.130 --> 27:40.590]  I've got to try and find a clip of that.
[27:40.610 --> 27:41.450]  I don't think I ever saw that.
[27:41.610 --> 27:46.670]  I remember doing that at midnight show where it's kind of, you just have to tell jokes on TV.
[27:46.930 --> 27:48.610]  And I was really nervous about doing that.
[27:48.810 --> 27:50.570]  And somehow I just got away with it.
[27:50.770 --> 27:51.450]  It was fine.
[27:51.530 --> 27:52.270]  Like it went well.
[27:52.610 --> 27:55.270]  And I just got out of there and I was just, my heart was beating and I was like,
[27:56.010 --> 27:56.670]  well, that's over.
[27:56.770 --> 27:57.850]  Let's never do that again.
[27:58.050 --> 28:00.590]  And then like a few months later, the opportunity came up again.
[28:01.110 --> 28:03.270]  And for some reason I was like, yeah, sure.
[28:03.450 --> 28:05.290]  And I was like, why did I do that?
[28:05.630 --> 28:07.910]  I somehow got away with that the first time.
[28:08.530 --> 28:09.290]  What am I doing?
[28:09.330 --> 28:10.490]  And I'm on the plane to LA.
[28:10.590 --> 28:11.850]  I'm like, it's stupid.
[28:11.950 --> 28:12.310]  Stupid.
[28:12.490 --> 28:13.430]  Why did I do that?
[28:14.050 --> 28:17.830]  I, dude, I did that with stand up for about a year and a half where it's like every time.
[28:17.910 --> 28:18.070]  Yeah.
[28:18.210 --> 28:20.510]  Every time you do it, you're like, I'm never doing that shit again.
[28:21.190 --> 28:21.830]  Documentary's over.
[28:21.990 --> 28:22.770]  RTX is over.
[28:23.070 --> 28:23.910]  No need.
[28:24.170 --> 28:26.090]  And then you're like, I fucking said yes.
[28:27.990 --> 28:33.310]  The last time I did, the last time I did stand up and what will maybe be the last time I do it
[28:33.310 --> 28:38.190]  in my life, although never say never, but I'm really not looking to do it again anytime soon.
[28:38.910 --> 28:40.070]  Was another RTX.
[28:40.470 --> 28:41.650]  And I don't think you did it that year.
[28:41.650 --> 28:44.990]  I think you did the first year, Andrew, in the second year, which was the last in person.
[28:45.190 --> 28:45.690]  No, it's never.
[28:45.850 --> 28:46.510]  I did it once.
[28:46.570 --> 28:47.430]  I wasn't invited again.
[28:47.550 --> 28:50.210]  Yeah, if you're not, well, you were, but no, it wasn't.
[28:50.290 --> 28:55.010]  If you're not, I don't think you were there or I'm into all the I was not an open.
[28:55.070 --> 28:56.790]  If I was invited, you have an open invitation.
[28:56.910 --> 28:57.130]  I did.
[28:57.270 --> 28:58.850]  Wait, is an open invitation real?
[28:58.870 --> 29:00.670]  I never believe the open invitation.
[29:00.930 --> 29:03.130]  Yes, yes, you have an open invitation.
[29:03.230 --> 29:03.410]  Okay.
[29:04.130 --> 29:06.650]  Anybody that's done stand up has an open invitation to do it at that event.
[29:07.110 --> 29:08.590]  If we ever have it again.
[29:09.490 --> 29:13.050]  Uh, anyway, if you're not familiar with it, RTX is an event that our company puts on
[29:13.050 --> 29:15.330]  Rooster Teeth in Austin every summer at the convention center.
[29:15.530 --> 29:16.330]  It's a whole thing.
[29:16.710 --> 29:21.230]  We do a bunch of counter like programming outside of the event at nights and weekends and stuff to
[29:21.230 --> 29:23.230]  give people shit to do outside of the convention center.
[29:23.350 --> 29:27.710]  One of those is a big block of stand up because there's a lot of stand up comedians who work in
[29:27.710 --> 29:31.450]  and around Rooster Teeth that either our employees or friends.
[29:32.390 --> 29:35.250]  So anyway, the last year we did it, I hadn't done it in.
[29:35.250 --> 29:40.410]  I hadn't done it since we went on tour in Australia and I had done it like on those shows,
[29:40.470 --> 29:46.010]  which was goddamn Andrew, you and I were doing stand up in front of like 200 people that night.
[29:46.410 --> 29:49.590]  In Australia, it was like 1500 to 2000 people.
[29:49.870 --> 29:51.890]  That was a whole other level of scary.
[29:52.150 --> 29:52.970]  I will admit.
[29:53.330 --> 29:58.390]  But the scariest was that last time because we were so slammed with RTX and I had people
[29:58.390 --> 30:04.370]  staying with me from out of town for RTX and my mom was here and it was all cool because
[30:04.370 --> 30:05.230]  they were helping and stuff.
[30:05.450 --> 30:06.910]  But you know what it's like in RTX.
[30:07.150 --> 30:11.950]  We're going from like event to event to event to event to event from like 7, 8 a.m.
[30:11.950 --> 30:13.510]  to like 1 a.m. every night.
[30:13.890 --> 30:16.670]  And we were like mega slammed before that with stuff.
[30:17.050 --> 30:21.450]  And I just, I thought Future Geoff, which is something I think way too often.
[30:21.550 --> 30:25.010]  I thought the set is a problem for Future Geoff.
[30:25.110 --> 30:26.010]  He's done it before.
[30:26.150 --> 30:27.230]  He's figured it out before.
[30:27.630 --> 30:28.630]  He'll figure it out again.
[30:28.870 --> 30:31.430]  Current Geoff is going to deal with the problems at hand, right?
[30:31.690 --> 30:33.030]  And I kept pushing it and pushing it.
[30:33.030 --> 30:34.470]  And then I thought, what do I care?
[30:34.510 --> 30:34.990]  I have a set.
[30:35.150 --> 30:36.930]  I'll just, I'll just polish that off.
[30:37.270 --> 30:42.630]  And about three days before we do the event, Emily asked.
[30:42.690 --> 30:44.010]  She's like, how are you feeling about your set?
[30:44.070 --> 30:45.250]  And I go, oh, that's a good point.
[30:45.410 --> 30:48.330]  I've been focused on this other shit, but I should probably sit down and see if I can
[30:48.330 --> 30:48.830]  remember it.
[30:49.110 --> 30:50.090]  And she goes, what do you remember?
[30:50.170 --> 30:50.310]  What?
[30:50.390 --> 30:53.850]  And I go, well, you know, the set that I do the joke about the bananas and coffee and,
[30:54.050 --> 30:55.190]  you know, sucking dick and all that stuff.
[30:55.450 --> 31:00.110]  And she goes, you mean the set you did in front of those same people in that same venue
[31:00.110 --> 31:01.510]  at the same event last year?
[31:02.150 --> 31:04.250]  And I was like, say what now?
[31:05.030 --> 31:09.830]  And she was like, yeah, the set you've already done one year ago for those people.
[31:10.230 --> 31:12.150]  You can't do the same set again, idiot.
[31:12.410 --> 31:13.670]  That's not how comedy works.
[31:14.110 --> 31:15.590]  You do, that tour's over.
[31:16.050 --> 31:17.050]  It's time for a new set.
[31:17.350 --> 31:20.030]  And I'm like, uh, it's Thursday.
[31:20.370 --> 31:22.210]  And that show's Friday night.
[31:23.730 --> 31:26.190]  And I panicked hard.
[31:26.570 --> 31:29.270]  And I thought, well, I've got like 24 hours to write a set.
[31:29.810 --> 31:31.390]  And unfortunately, I didn't.
[31:31.510 --> 31:33.590]  Because then we ran from event to event to event.
[31:33.890 --> 31:38.430]  It got so bad, and I kept pushing it off, that we were driving in the car to the event
[31:38.430 --> 31:43.370]  with Emily and Millie and one of her friends and my mom.
[31:43.890 --> 31:46.490]  And we're about maybe 15 blocks from the event.
[31:46.610 --> 31:48.270]  And I made them pull over and let me out.
[31:48.750 --> 31:52.590]  And I walked to the event because I was hyperventilating and I was freaking out.
[31:52.770 --> 31:53.990]  And I needed to calm down.
[31:54.410 --> 31:59.030]  And in the space from like, I don't know, 12th street to 5th street,
[31:59.030 --> 32:01.610]  where the event was, I wrote a set in my head.
[32:02.150 --> 32:05.830]  And then I got there, and I didn't have any way to record it.
[32:06.110 --> 32:08.270]  And I ran around looking for a pen or pencil.
[32:08.810 --> 32:12.890]  And then I walked around upstairs, and I wrote like 10 things down on my hands.
[32:13.090 --> 32:16.250]  And I just stared at my, I just sat down and I, or I spaced actually.
[32:16.530 --> 32:17.250]  And I didn't talk to anybody.
[32:17.350 --> 32:18.130]  I wouldn't let anybody talk to me.
[32:18.290 --> 32:22.210]  And I just walked, I just looked at my hands for about an hour as I walked back and forth.
[32:22.450 --> 32:24.790]  And then I just walked up on set or on stage.
[32:25.250 --> 32:27.950]  And I did fucking 20 minutes of stand up off my hands.
[32:27.950 --> 32:30.490]  And I killed, and I didn't fall flat on my face.
[32:30.690 --> 32:34.010]  And I walked off stage and said, that's the last time I'll ever do that.
[32:34.450 --> 32:34.830]  It was not worth it.
[32:34.830 --> 32:36.430]  That's creativity under pressure.
[32:36.710 --> 32:37.230]  That's insane.
[32:37.710 --> 32:38.890]  I guess that's a good thing.
[32:39.070 --> 32:40.230]  It was terrifying.
[32:40.430 --> 32:41.950]  It means that no one's getting complacent.
[32:42.090 --> 32:45.970]  The fact that you're like set, what, 18 years into this career,
[32:46.430 --> 32:47.510]  and it still makes you nervous.
[32:47.850 --> 32:50.530]  Oh, yeah, dude, that's a whole other kind of scary.
[32:50.750 --> 32:53.190]  You know, we do tons of live events and stage events.
[32:53.270 --> 32:55.870]  But when you're on stage with like four or five, six other people,
[32:55.870 --> 32:58.230]  it's a whole different world than when it's just you.
[32:58.510 --> 33:00.550]  And you're trying to like, you're not going off the cuff.
[33:00.650 --> 33:02.950]  You're trying to remember rehearsed, prepared shit, you know?
[33:04.370 --> 33:05.570]  Yeah, it's terrifying.
[33:06.110 --> 33:08.930]  Did you have a moment of confidence, though, after you did that?
[33:09.070 --> 33:11.750]  Like any, is there any amount of time in which you're like,
[33:11.750 --> 33:12.970]  I can do this tomorrow, no problem?
[33:14.130 --> 33:16.250]  Yeah, there's first off, there's a wave of relief.
[33:16.590 --> 33:18.590]  That's like, it's like double overhead.
[33:18.610 --> 33:20.950]  It's like fucking endless summer.
[33:20.950 --> 33:26.210]  Like fucking huge, you know, giant Jerry Garcia waves.
[33:26.570 --> 33:28.390]  And Jerry Garcia is not a wave.
[33:28.470 --> 33:29.110]  I'm thinking of a different guy.
[33:29.290 --> 33:32.530]  But anyway, yes, there's like a huge wave of relief.
[33:32.850 --> 33:32.890]  Yes.
[33:33.130 --> 33:37.190]  And then followed by feeling invincible and like you're the funniest person on Earth.
[33:37.210 --> 33:40.190]  And you can do anything for about two days.
[33:40.410 --> 33:40.810]  Yeah.
[33:40.830 --> 33:43.570]  And then realizing, oh, no, oh, no, that fades really quickly.
[33:43.590 --> 33:45.130]  And you go, I dodged a fucking bullet.
[33:45.290 --> 33:46.010]  I got lucky.
[33:46.030 --> 33:50.730]  I can't put myself in a situation like that again, where I have to dig myself out.
[33:50.950 --> 33:52.290]  In front of people, it's just not.
[33:52.970 --> 33:53.170]  Yeah.
[33:53.490 --> 33:56.270]  Now, I had my confidence lasted for an evening.
[33:56.590 --> 33:58.570]  It was an evening of invulnerability.
[33:59.030 --> 34:03.090]  And then the next day I was laying on the couch watching a movie and I couldn't figure
[34:03.090 --> 34:04.650]  out why my lower back was so sore.
[34:04.750 --> 34:07.610]  Then I remembered I drained a bathtub with a bucket the day before.
[34:09.950 --> 34:11.670]  I really tightened up my back.
[34:12.410 --> 34:15.650]  Did you ever retrospectively figure out how to drain that?
[34:15.650 --> 34:17.170]  Yeah, that's the, you know, I didn't want to.
[34:17.770 --> 34:20.910]  I figured I drained the tub 90% of the way.
[34:21.110 --> 34:24.130]  And then I had a moment of clarity and I just Googled bathtub drains.
[34:24.250 --> 34:26.310]  And I saw like a list of six different ones.
[34:26.470 --> 34:28.530]  And I drained the last like 10%.
[34:28.530 --> 34:29.710]  I figured it out.
[34:30.050 --> 34:33.090]  But I had already scooped out the majority of the tub.
[34:33.510 --> 34:35.370]  Oh, I like that you needed closure on that.
[34:35.410 --> 34:35.750]  I did.
[34:35.930 --> 34:38.550]  Well, it's just I was like, this is I can't.
[34:38.650 --> 34:39.410]  I'm not this stupid.
[34:39.710 --> 34:41.990]  I got to be able to figure out how to lift this drain.
[34:42.150 --> 34:43.770]  And I'm just panicking and freaking out.
[34:44.070 --> 34:44.670]  It's my anxiety.
[34:44.670 --> 34:48.970]  I have been really confused by bathtubs in the past, like American ones,
[34:49.210 --> 34:50.370]  like staying at other people's houses.
[34:50.510 --> 34:53.690]  There was one where to get the, this was so unintuitive,
[34:53.870 --> 34:56.690]  to get the water to come out of the showerhead above the bath.
[34:56.930 --> 35:02.090]  You had to like pull down the rim of the tap, like where the water was coming out.
[35:02.410 --> 35:03.330]  It was like a ring.
[35:03.510 --> 35:04.190]  Do you know what I'm talking about?
[35:04.370 --> 35:05.570]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:05.870 --> 35:07.550]  And I've never seen that mechanism before.
[35:07.570 --> 35:09.450]  I was like, who the hell could ever figure that out?
[35:09.570 --> 35:11.690]  Yeah, and sometimes you have to pull that ring and then turn it.
[35:11.850 --> 35:12.830]  So yeah, yeah.
[35:12.830 --> 35:15.450]  I was, I was fiddling with everything around the tub.
[35:15.510 --> 35:16.330]  I could not get it.
[35:16.450 --> 35:18.970]  It's the same for me and hotels in Europe and the UK.
[35:19.390 --> 35:23.310]  Like every American has to spend six or seven minutes
[35:23.730 --> 35:25.810]  when they get into a hotel in Europe or the UK,
[35:25.810 --> 35:29.230]  trying to figure out how to, where to put the fucking car to turn the lights on
[35:29.230 --> 35:32.070]  and then trying to figure out how to make hot water.
[35:32.810 --> 35:36.790]  So many people would text to me, RTX UK would text me like,
[35:36.870 --> 35:38.030]  how do I charge my shit?
[35:38.250 --> 35:41.070]  I put it plugged in and I was like, you have to hit the switch,
[35:41.070 --> 35:42.490]  switch on every plug.
[35:43.050 --> 35:45.250]  It's not just always on electricity.
[35:45.870 --> 35:49.190]  It almost feels like they're taken from escape rooms when I go to different places,
[35:49.350 --> 35:52.170]  like the mechanisms involved to like, try to figure out just...
[35:52.170 --> 35:55.950]  I'm 32, juggling family, working full-time and earning a bachelor's degree.
[35:56.170 --> 36:00.350]  At University of Phoenix, I earn career-relevant skills with every five-week course.
[36:00.490 --> 36:02.890]  Skills I can use now, not just after graduation.

[36:37.410 --> 36:40.890]  This episode is brought to you by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery.

[37:00.170 --> 37:00.810]  neck of the woods.
[37:00.810 --> 37:03.970]  Dogfish Head Craft Brewery is located in Milton, Delaware.
[37:04.190 --> 37:05.210]  Please drink responsibly.
[37:34.630 --> 37:36.070]  service provider to use.
[37:36.430 --> 37:43.270]  The sad thing is most of us have very little choice because ISPs operate like monopolies
[37:43.270 --> 37:44.510]  in the regions they serve.
[37:44.790 --> 37:50.010]  They then use this monopoly power to take advantage of customers.
[37:50.290 --> 37:50.790]  That's us.
[37:51.350 --> 37:57.290]  Data caps, streaming throttles, the list goes on and on and on.
[37:57.290 --> 38:05.290]  But worst of all, many ISPs log your internet activity and then they sell that data on to
[38:05.290 --> 38:11.190]  big other tech companies or advertisers or international spoon and thimble cabals.
[38:11.390 --> 38:19.690]  To prevent ISPs from seeing my internet activity, I protect all of my devices with ExpressVPN.
[38:20.570 --> 38:22.410]  So what is ExpressVPN?
[38:23.150 --> 38:24.090]  Well, I'll tell you.
[38:24.090 --> 38:30.210]  It's a simple app for your computer or smartphone or both that encrypts all your network data
[38:30.990 --> 38:33.410]  that's the encryption sound and tunnels it
[38:34.070 --> 38:41.330]  that's the cyber tunnel through a secure VPN server so that your ISP cannot see any of
[38:41.330 --> 38:42.050]  your activity.
[38:42.650 --> 38:45.170]  Just think about how much of your life is on the internet.
[38:45.670 --> 38:50.870]  Sadly, the list of people you just messaged, sites you visited, spoons you've bought,
[38:50.870 --> 38:57.490]  thimbles you've thumbed over, and videos you've watched get tracked by those tech giants who
[38:57.490 --> 39:01.370]  can then sell that information for profit at your loss.
[39:01.550 --> 39:07.810]  That's the reason I recommend ExpressVPN as the best way to hide your online activity
[39:07.810 --> 39:09.490]  from your ISP.
[39:10.230 --> 39:14.270]  You just download the app, tap one button on...
[39:14.270 --> 39:19.550]  You just download the app, tap one button on your device, and you're protected.

[41:30.510 --> 41:34.030]  You really overcomplicate things, Andrew, because I've been trying to teach you how
[41:34.030 --> 41:36.990]  to make a cheese sandwich and you've not been able to figure it out.
[41:36.990 --> 41:37.670]  Let's get to that.
[41:39.610 --> 41:41.950]  Gavin unf***faced a thing for me, which is great.
[41:42.030 --> 41:43.150]  And he didn't even need to do it.
[41:43.390 --> 41:50.350]  I f***faced myself and Gavin unknowingly then f***faced himself and his f***face reversed
[41:50.350 --> 41:50.870]  mine.
[41:51.170 --> 41:51.630]  What was...
[41:51.630 --> 41:52.170]  I feel like it's...
[41:52.170 --> 41:52.750]  Do I know what this is?
[41:53.090 --> 41:53.790]  Oh, no, no.
[41:53.850 --> 41:54.770]  I haven't talked to you about this.
[41:54.770 --> 41:55.210]  Jesus Christ, that's convoluted.
[41:55.530 --> 41:55.750]  Okay.
[41:55.870 --> 41:56.750]  Well, it's true.
[41:56.850 --> 41:57.310]  It's what happened.
[41:57.570 --> 42:02.170]  So I have, as I talked about on this show, I bit into my phone, my old phone.
[42:02.650 --> 42:06.710]  I cracked the screen with my teeth and then it died.
[42:07.190 --> 42:08.730]  And I'm not a big phone person.
[42:08.850 --> 42:12.850]  So I just bought the like the cheapest phone I could get off of Amazon that would do express
[42:12.850 --> 42:13.210]  shipping.
[42:13.210 --> 42:14.990]  And I bought this piece of shit.
[42:16.510 --> 42:18.330]  Samsung J2, I think it's called.
[42:18.410 --> 42:19.190]  It's from 2015.
[42:20.130 --> 42:20.790]  It's just...
[42:20.790 --> 42:25.030]  Honestly, the pictures, the pictures he sends me, the videos are so small.
[42:25.050 --> 42:25.190]  Yeah.
[42:25.390 --> 42:29.010]  They're like, they're honestly about 60 pixels wide.
[42:29.190 --> 42:31.210]  It's like you're texting me from 2004.
[42:31.210 --> 42:31.790]  Yeah.
[42:32.150 --> 42:35.370]  All of the photos look fuzzy and just terrible.
[42:35.730 --> 42:38.030]  And the video I sent you was like a postage stamp.
[42:38.670 --> 42:39.550]  And I can deal with that.
[42:39.610 --> 42:41.830]  But even like the keyboard, there's an input delay.
[42:41.970 --> 42:45.110]  So like be typing things and nothing will appear and then it'll all appear and it'll
[42:45.110 --> 42:46.250]  be one giant word.
[42:46.390 --> 42:47.530]  Like the spaces don't work.
[42:47.590 --> 42:50.870]  And it can take me like three minutes to write a 10 word sentence.
[42:51.170 --> 42:53.210]  So it's just, it's this shitty phone.
[42:53.230 --> 42:54.710]  And I was complaining to it about Gavin.
[42:55.070 --> 42:57.670]  And Gavin was kind enough to say like, hey, I have this phone.
[42:57.730 --> 42:59.250]  I'm not using older phone.
[42:59.290 --> 43:00.450]  It's way better than what you have.
[43:00.450 --> 43:01.810]  I can mail it to you if you want.
[43:02.590 --> 43:04.730]  And I thought that's super nice of you.
[43:04.790 --> 43:05.570]  You don't have to do that.
[43:05.630 --> 43:07.310]  But if you did it, I'd really appreciate it.
[43:07.830 --> 43:08.930]  And so we kind of talked about it.
[43:09.150 --> 43:11.810]  We kind of, the conversation ended there for a bit.
[43:12.450 --> 43:14.190]  And I was thinking about that phone.
[43:14.610 --> 43:16.530]  And I'm not a big phone person.
[43:16.690 --> 43:18.430]  And it's the worst phone I've ever owned.
[43:18.910 --> 43:22.370]  But it's the only phone that it has like a personal meaning to me.
[43:23.430 --> 43:26.470]  When my grandma was sick, I was spending a lot of time with her.
[43:27.090 --> 43:31.730]  And she doesn't know anything about technology or phones or stuff like that.
[43:31.790 --> 43:34.270]  There's no concept of the kind of outside world.
[43:34.370 --> 43:36.810]  She was pretty confused at this time anyway.
[43:37.270 --> 43:39.030]  But she had cancer.
[43:39.330 --> 43:40.810]  And I was spending a lot of time with her.
[43:40.890 --> 43:44.950]  And when I'd spend that time, I'd end up ordering food quite a bit.
[43:45.030 --> 43:45.850]  And I'd get food deliveries.
[43:46.870 --> 43:49.910]  And it was, I think, the last day I got to spend with her.
[43:50.410 --> 43:52.430]  And she would never ask for anything.
[43:52.570 --> 43:54.770]  But my grandma loved hot dogs.
[43:54.850 --> 43:55.890]  It was her favorite food.
[43:55.890 --> 44:01.570]  And she had somehow made this connection that the phone and the food were connected in some way.
[44:02.010 --> 44:04.450]  So I was looking at this phone, my piece of shit phone.
[44:05.070 --> 44:08.830]  And she just looked at me and said, can you get a hot dog on that thing?
[44:09.630 --> 44:15.050]  And just to be clear, she doesn't understand Uber Eats or anything like that.
[44:15.230 --> 44:19.570]  She was asking me if I could pull a hot dog out of the ether.
[44:20.470 --> 44:22.670]  That's such a wonderful question.
[44:22.670 --> 44:23.610]  I love that.
[44:23.970 --> 44:24.650]  Oh my god.
[44:24.650 --> 44:26.530]  It's a great moment.
[44:26.750 --> 44:30.210]  And I'm kind of taken aback, not just because of the question, but she would never ask for
[44:30.210 --> 44:31.150]  things, really, ever.
[44:31.710 --> 44:32.970]  And so I thought about it for a minute.
[44:33.050 --> 44:36.150]  I was like, yeah, you know, there's a hot dog place I could order from.
[44:36.210 --> 44:37.570]  I said, yeah, I can get us hot dogs.
[44:37.970 --> 44:40.230]  And she just lit up and said, I'll take two.
[44:41.510 --> 44:44.850]  Which was absurd because she wasn't really eating that much at that time.
[44:45.950 --> 44:47.310]  But then I ordered hot dogs.
[44:47.510 --> 44:51.750]  And so, this is funny too, they were like cheap $3 hot dogs.
[44:51.850 --> 44:53.610]  And it's one of the nicest memories I have with her.
[44:54.790 --> 44:59.390]  And then from that point forward, I would jokingly call my phone the magic hot dog device.
[44:59.850 --> 45:01.670]  Because that's what, in her eyes, it was.
[45:02.210 --> 45:04.830]  And whenever I'd use it, even though it was a piece of shit, I'd think about her.
[45:04.890 --> 45:06.230]  And that was a nice memory.
[45:06.870 --> 45:07.930]  So I had all these thoughts.
[45:08.070 --> 45:12.610]  And I'm like, man, it's such a f*** face that the shittiest phone I've ever owned is one that
[45:12.610 --> 45:14.090]  I have a personal attachment to.
[45:14.710 --> 45:17.410]  And Gavin's going to send me this new phone, which is super nice.
[45:17.530 --> 45:21.750]  But I just, I don't know if I'm ready yet to switch phones.
[45:22.310 --> 45:23.030]  And so I picked up...
[45:23.030 --> 45:23.410]  To make the leap.
[45:23.410 --> 45:23.930]  Yeah.
[45:24.030 --> 45:25.270]  So then I picked up the phone.
[45:25.350 --> 45:26.790]  I was going to text Gavin this.
[45:26.910 --> 45:30.770]  And as I was holding it in my hand, I got a text from Gavin that just said,
[45:30.850 --> 45:33.270]  never ship anything to Canada ever.
[45:35.190 --> 45:37.690]  It was, I guess, this is a pain.
[45:37.970 --> 45:38.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[45:38.890 --> 45:42.630]  So you expressing that, like it was such a pain in the ass to ship it to me.
[45:42.730 --> 45:45.970]  I then thought, well, okay, well, if you went through the effort of sending it,
[45:46.050 --> 45:48.930]  and it was an annoyance, I now have to swap phones, which is great.
[45:49.170 --> 45:52.190]  It freed me into upgrading my phone.
[45:52.190 --> 45:54.650]  So you unf*** face my scenario of like,
[45:54.770 --> 45:56.630]  I'm going to be stuck with this phone until it dies,
[45:56.730 --> 45:59.290]  which will probably be 20 years from now, knowing my luck.
[45:59.730 --> 46:00.570]  And so I've swapped phones.
[46:00.590 --> 46:02.390]  I don't want you to have any obligation though.
[46:02.530 --> 46:03.350]  You chucked my phone in the bin.
[46:03.350 --> 46:04.810]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:04.950 --> 46:07.750]  It's just, it's like, well, yeah, I'm going to save the phone.
[46:07.810 --> 46:10.450]  I'll do something nice with the phone, the hot dog device.
[46:10.970 --> 46:13.450]  But I was able to switch because of your annoyance.
[46:13.550 --> 46:17.290]  Like in my head, it would be more rude to not then accept to tell you
[46:17.290 --> 46:19.110]  I'm going to continue using my piece of shit phone.
[46:19.570 --> 46:20.730]  So I appreciate it.
[46:20.730 --> 46:24.230]  That sounds like a really sweet and beautiful moment all around,
[46:24.350 --> 46:27.950]  from the gesture from Gavin to the special time you spent with your grandmother
[46:27.950 --> 46:30.650]  and the fact that you have that like wonderful memory
[46:30.650 --> 46:31.530]  every time you look at that phone.
[46:31.670 --> 46:33.730]  And in the spirit of that, I have to ask,
[46:33.950 --> 46:37.190]  at any point during those moments with your grandmother
[46:37.190 --> 46:39.690]  when you were enjoying hot dogs together,
[46:40.170 --> 46:42.630]  did you, do you, and you probably didn't,
[46:42.710 --> 46:44.230]  but just if this jogs the memory,
[46:44.530 --> 46:48.110]  do you remember you and your grandmother ever discussing hot dog color?
[46:49.830 --> 46:51.730]  No, I did not. Yeah, that was later.
[46:51.970 --> 46:52.450]  That's great.
[46:52.490 --> 46:53.150]  Just had to ask.
[46:53.330 --> 46:55.230]  Somebody said, yeah, yeah, no, it's a great question.
[46:55.470 --> 46:58.410]  Somebody sent me like a color breakdown of hot dogs the other day.
[46:58.470 --> 46:59.830]  I wish I had that to pull up.
[47:01.150 --> 47:03.090]  But no, they made it or like, did that already?
[47:03.310 --> 47:05.110]  I have no idea if they made it or if it existed,
[47:05.130 --> 47:07.870]  but it was like a very clear, like, this is what this shade is.
[47:07.930 --> 47:09.210]  This is what this shade is.
[47:10.110 --> 47:11.810]  But Gavin didn't just send me a phone.
[47:12.710 --> 47:16.350]  Gavin sent me, maybe arguably greater than a phone.
[47:17.510 --> 47:20.370]  Gavin sent me a jar of Branston pickles.
[47:23.370 --> 47:26.790]  I had to, I got my shipment stopped.
[47:27.030 --> 47:31.050]  They were like, we're not shipping this unless you provide us a commercial invoice.
[47:31.130 --> 47:32.910]  And I was like, wait, you want me to write up?
[47:33.430 --> 47:35.830]  And I'm sending him trash, basically.
[47:35.990 --> 47:38.770]  You want me to write up that I'm sending him some pickles in a jar?
[47:39.010 --> 47:39.250]  All right.
[47:39.610 --> 47:42.890]  So I had to put like a dollar value to each item on his thing.
[47:43.810 --> 47:46.730]  Also, just a great, another part I missed about it.
[47:48.030 --> 47:51.050]  The name they used when they called about Gavin's,
[47:51.110 --> 47:53.530]  they called me Don Burton, the person on the phone.
[47:54.010 --> 47:59.330]  It's the most wrong anyone's ever gotten with either name.
[47:59.850 --> 48:02.610]  It's just, it's so, I don't know how you get to Don Burton.
[48:04.670 --> 48:07.050]  But they did, which is fantastic.
[48:07.470 --> 48:09.090]  I really wish I didn't read the box.
[48:09.610 --> 48:10.570]  I got the pickles.
[48:10.730 --> 48:11.790]  I'm so surprised.
[48:12.210 --> 48:13.350]  Oh, you read the pickles?
[48:13.610 --> 48:13.690]  I did.
[48:13.910 --> 48:16.330]  Yeah, I had to put, I didn't want to lie about what I was sending.
[48:16.770 --> 48:20.630]  I didn't want to commit some sort of weird international fraud crime.
[48:20.790 --> 48:21.810]  Lose your green card.
[48:24.670 --> 48:25.910]  Yeah, so I had to write pickles on it.
[48:26.110 --> 48:29.190]  I can't believe it made it to you though, because your address just looks like,
[48:29.730 --> 48:33.610]  like a kid with crayons just like spilled a tub of crayons on some paper.
[48:33.670 --> 48:38.330]  I don't know about you, but it's also unbelievably expensive to ship.
[48:38.330 --> 48:42.730]  When I sent Andrew that stupid little baseball bat, the first one,
[48:43.110 --> 48:45.310]  that was like, it cost over $100 to send it to him, I think.
[48:45.550 --> 48:46.670]  I think you sent $117.
[48:46.970 --> 48:49.010]  A $0.30 baseball bat.
[48:49.810 --> 48:51.430]  Yeah, I can't remember what it cost me to send.
[48:51.670 --> 48:55.410]  I was too busy faffing around with all the extra paperwork to really worry about the price.
[48:56.090 --> 49:00.070]  I don't know if it said on the package, but yeah, it was surprisingly expensive, isn't it?
[49:01.110 --> 49:01.910]  Yeah, it is.
[49:02.190 --> 49:04.710]  It was a great moment to read phone and pickle,
[49:04.710 --> 49:08.030]  where like I just saw on the front of the package.
[49:08.550 --> 49:10.270]  So then I got this and I asked Gavin,
[49:10.910 --> 49:13.350]  what do I use this on? Like, what would be the ideal thing?
[49:13.850 --> 49:14.590]  And he told me...
[49:14.590 --> 49:17.770]  Our text conversation blew my mind. What did I tell you?
[49:18.090 --> 49:21.330]  Well, you told me a cheddar sandwich, which just, I didn't understand.
[49:22.330 --> 49:23.510]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[49:23.510 --> 49:23.790]  What do you mean?
[49:24.050 --> 49:25.050]  Okay, hold on a second.
[49:25.250 --> 49:25.490]  Go ahead.
[49:27.250 --> 49:28.590]  What is a cheddar sandwich?
[49:28.650 --> 49:31.350]  Thank you. That's what I said. What is it?
[49:31.490 --> 49:33.790]  Yeah, I was just describing what he should have the pickle with.
[49:33.790 --> 49:37.970]  So I suggested a slice of cheddar cheese, put the Branson on top.
[49:38.350 --> 49:39.030]  And that's it.
[49:39.130 --> 49:39.750]  That's not what you said.
[49:40.030 --> 49:41.650]  You literally know what I said.
[49:41.670 --> 49:42.650]  You said a cheddar sandwich.
[49:42.650 --> 49:44.050]  And I said, what's a cheddar sandwich?
[49:44.250 --> 49:45.910]  And then you thought I was crazy for asking.
[49:45.990 --> 49:47.090]  Well, what does it sound like?
[49:48.370 --> 49:54.530]  Well, first off, nobody eats a slice of cheese on two pieces of bread and calls it a sandwich.
[49:55.630 --> 49:56.770]  That's a cheese sandwich.
[49:56.970 --> 49:57.650]  No, it's not.
[49:57.850 --> 50:01.610]  It's an uncooked grilled cheese sandwich that hasn't been finished yet.
[50:01.610 --> 50:03.710]  Oh my god, that's what Andrew said.
[50:03.870 --> 50:04.410]  Word for word.
[50:04.630 --> 50:08.510]  Andrew said, I'm not a cold or room temperature cheese guy.
[50:08.690 --> 50:10.070]  He said this to me over tech.
[50:10.390 --> 50:11.690]  Add that to the list.
[50:12.330 --> 50:14.770]  So if you have like a ham and cheese sandwich,
[50:15.410 --> 50:18.630]  you can't have cold fridge cheese or room temperature cheese?
[50:18.890 --> 50:20.350]  I'd always want the cheese to be melted.
[50:20.510 --> 50:23.730]  If I have a choice, I'm always going to choose for above room temperature cheese.
[50:23.930 --> 50:24.210]  No.
[50:24.610 --> 50:28.590]  What do you want? You want like a bunch of melted schmear on a cheese plate?
[50:28.590 --> 50:32.730]  What I said to Gavin Geoff was that if you do just a cheddar cheese sandwich,
[50:32.850 --> 50:35.450]  you've done all the work of a grilled cheese with none of the pleasure.
[50:35.710 --> 50:36.710]  It's madness to me.
[50:37.010 --> 50:37.790]  Why would you not just toast?
[50:37.790 --> 50:38.190]  I totally agree.
[50:38.630 --> 50:42.550]  Now, I have to, in defense of Gavin, I do have to switch back onto his side a minute
[50:42.550 --> 50:46.610]  and say that room temperature and cold cheese is totally fine.
[50:46.670 --> 50:46.890]  Yeah.
[50:47.030 --> 50:48.410]  When it's on the appropriate sandwich.
[50:48.770 --> 50:49.930]  I just, it's just weird.
[50:50.030 --> 50:55.370]  It's like I had a cousin when I was growing up who would put mustard on two pieces of bread
[50:55.370 --> 50:57.290]  and eat it for lunch and call it a mustard sandwich.
[50:57.290 --> 50:58.590]  That's not a fucking sandwich.
[50:59.650 --> 51:04.210]  One slice, one slice of cheddar cheese between two pieces of untoasted bread
[51:04.210 --> 51:06.950]  with no butter or anything else is not a sandwich.
[51:07.250 --> 51:09.150]  It's two pieces of bread and a piece of cheese.
[51:09.350 --> 51:10.310]  It's, it's shit.
[51:10.410 --> 51:11.190]  This is all I had.
[51:11.710 --> 51:12.370]  I'm with you.
[51:12.450 --> 51:16.270]  Although I guess if you put the Branson pickle on it, I don't, that may add another dimension to it.
[51:16.390 --> 51:17.250]  I don't know.
[51:17.510 --> 51:20.330]  So you're complaining to me over text about how it's a cold sandwich.
[51:20.470 --> 51:23.790]  I'm like, look, that's a valid, that's a perfectly normal sandwich.
[51:24.210 --> 51:25.330]  A cheese sandwich on its own.
[51:25.430 --> 51:26.150]  I would eat that.
[51:26.150 --> 51:27.410]  I used to eat that at school, probably.
[51:28.050 --> 51:31.130]  You said, do I put turkey on a cheddar sandwich?
[51:31.350 --> 51:32.110]  Well, it just seemed...
[51:32.110 --> 51:33.690]  Is mozzarella cheddar?
[51:33.930 --> 51:38.470]  I said, no, slice a block of cheddar, put Branson pickle on it.
[51:38.550 --> 51:39.530]  Do you need a diagram?
[51:40.030 --> 51:43.070]  You said, why is it called mozzarella cheddar?
[51:43.550 --> 51:45.330]  And then you said, ignore that.
[51:45.510 --> 51:46.370]  I misread the list.
[51:46.630 --> 51:52.170]  I had to order everything to figure out this rant because I wanted to do it on the show.
[51:52.230 --> 51:54.090]  I didn't have anything I needed for it.
[51:54.610 --> 51:55.430]  So do you have that now?
[51:55.450 --> 51:55.790]  I do.
[51:55.790 --> 51:58.870]  I have a variety of items that I could try this Branson.
[51:59.130 --> 52:04.410]  It's one of the most quick to make and simple sandwiches possible on the planet.
[52:04.410 --> 52:05.490]  I'm going to be honest with you, Gavin.
[52:05.590 --> 52:08.910]  I popped it open and I started to gag as soon as I did.
[52:11.090 --> 52:13.930]  Well, listen, you've never had this.
[52:14.090 --> 52:17.790]  And here I am, I'm poopooing the sandwich too, and I've never had it.
[52:18.150 --> 52:21.730]  Gavin is holding on to knowledge that you and I don't yet have.
[52:21.910 --> 52:23.530]  So keep an open mind.
[52:23.610 --> 52:24.970]  Maybe it doesn't taste like it smells.
[52:24.970 --> 52:29.070]  And Andrew, before we start, can I make a very serious request?
[52:30.510 --> 52:33.190]  Can I ask you to not put chow mein on it?
[52:33.190 --> 52:34.290]  Yeah. Okay.
[52:34.430 --> 52:35.470]  Well, Gavin was giving...
[52:35.470 --> 52:38.030]  I said that I have salad cream paranoia now,
[52:38.310 --> 52:41.210]  because I still feel like I delivered on the request of salad cream.
[52:41.610 --> 52:43.290]  And we're arguing about what is and isn't.
[52:43.510 --> 52:45.730]  The salad is the canvas of the food world.
[52:46.070 --> 52:47.610]  You just throw whatever you want on it.
[52:47.650 --> 52:49.170]  There are no rules to a salad.
[52:49.490 --> 52:50.350]  Anything's a salad.
[52:50.510 --> 52:51.910]  You add stuff to it.
[52:51.910 --> 52:55.970]  He was like, if you're making lemon meringue pie, would you just skip the lemon?
[52:56.110 --> 52:57.390]  And I'm like, no, I'm a recipe guy.
[52:57.530 --> 52:58.870]  I will follow the recipe.
[52:59.270 --> 53:00.530]  But a salad is a canvas.
[53:01.310 --> 53:04.010]  I said you just put chow mein and pine nuts in it.
[53:04.990 --> 53:06.330]  A salad is chaos.
[53:06.610 --> 53:09.010]  Did you guys see what Nick typed in the Discord?
[53:09.510 --> 53:09.950]  No.
[53:12.130 --> 53:14.710]  Andrew put charcuterie boards in the microwave.
[53:14.950 --> 53:18.770]  Wait, is a charcuterie board... is that the cheese thing?
[53:19.010 --> 53:19.630]  It's a cheese plate.
[53:19.690 --> 53:21.350]  Yeah, see, I've never had a cheese plate.
[53:21.350 --> 53:23.790]  So I'm open... I'm open to being more accepting.
[53:23.970 --> 53:26.710]  He did tell me on text that he's not a cheese plate guy.
[53:26.730 --> 53:29.650]  Well, no, no, no, no, no, it's just I haven't had it.
[53:29.750 --> 53:31.210]  So I'm not... I'm saying I'm open.
[53:31.330 --> 53:33.770]  I like the idea of being somebody who's into cheese plates.
[53:33.850 --> 53:34.690]  I just have never tried one.
[53:34.890 --> 53:38.070]  He ended up this text conversation just saying, this is chaos.
[53:38.390 --> 53:41.050]  And then I sent... I thought, look, I'm going to help him out.
[53:41.190 --> 53:45.050]  I made myself today for lunch a Branson and cheddar sandwich.
[53:45.050 --> 53:47.090]  And I sent him a picture of how the layout should be.
[53:47.330 --> 53:49.730]  Oh, and he just replied, I hate it.
[53:49.730 --> 53:53.730]  Yeah, because it's just like you made a grilled cheese and ruined it is how I viewed it.
[53:54.070 --> 53:55.510]  Grilled cheese is such a great item.
[53:55.570 --> 53:57.370]  You don't have to... you don't have to melt all your cheese.
[53:57.670 --> 54:01.130]  Melted cheese is the best type of cheese, though, in my opinion.
[54:01.330 --> 54:02.030]  It's pretty good.
[54:02.230 --> 54:03.250]  Melted cheese is pretty good.
[54:03.290 --> 54:08.290]  Maybe you should try Branson and melted cheese and see if that improves it next week.
[54:10.230 --> 54:14.570]  So... so you're about to try a cold cheese Branson sandwich?
[54:14.810 --> 54:17.470]  I got my cheese. I'm assembling it as we speak.
[54:17.470 --> 54:21.130]  I feel like you're both describing it in the most disgusting way possible.
[54:22.350 --> 54:23.230]  How should we describe it?
[54:23.230 --> 54:25.530]  Would you really not go for this, Geoff? Would you try this?
[54:25.650 --> 54:28.830]  I don't... I mean, I'll try. I'll try just about anything that's not snake related.
[54:29.350 --> 54:30.650]  I... Yeah, that's not... that's not white.
[54:31.090 --> 54:32.070]  Yeah. Is it white?
[54:32.870 --> 54:33.110]  No.
[54:33.370 --> 54:36.230]  I was under the impression it would be like... I feel like it's like brown.
[54:36.530 --> 54:37.330]  It's like a chutney, right?
[54:37.330 --> 54:38.370]  It's very brown.
[54:38.450 --> 54:41.550]  I can put... do you want me to put the picture that I sent to Andrew in the Discord?
[54:41.810 --> 54:44.850]  I would love it. Oh, that reminds me, before we end, I need to send you guys two photos.
[54:45.050 --> 54:45.350]  Okay.
[54:45.570 --> 54:45.810]  Okay.
[54:45.810 --> 54:49.370]  I'm waiting for a photo to appear or a Canadian man to eat a sandwich.
[54:49.370 --> 54:51.310]  Yeah, I'm putting... I'm spreading.
[54:51.690 --> 54:52.390]  I don't... ugh.
[54:52.530 --> 54:57.890]  Oh! From... okay. Okay, from where I'm sitting, the computer's far enough away,
[54:57.970 --> 55:03.150]  what it looks like, shrunken down the thumbnail, it looks like a fucking slice of white bread
[55:03.150 --> 55:09.170]  with a piece of American cheese, maybe not even cheddar, and then I think maybe 20 smooshed raisins.
[55:09.210 --> 55:14.290]  I don't know why cheddar here is like bright yellow. I don't know. It's like sharp cheddar,
[55:14.290 --> 55:18.670]  apparently. It's not... that's not the way my cheddar looked, but that was what I could get here
[55:18.670 --> 55:20.430]  in this American place.
[55:20.550 --> 55:22.570]  That you fought so hard to live in. You know you like our cheese.
[55:22.590 --> 55:22.730]  Yeah.
[55:23.030 --> 55:23.670]  That's what brought you here.
[55:24.090 --> 55:26.870]  That... it just looks like raisins. It looks like smooshy raisins.
[55:27.190 --> 55:30.890]  I would rather have raisins on cheese than this, I'm pretty sure.
[55:33.010 --> 55:33.370]  Cranberries.
[55:33.710 --> 55:36.110]  All right, so what's... where are you in the process right now?
[55:36.130 --> 55:41.030]  I put the stuff on the cheese. I don't even know if I like cold cheese. I don't...
[55:41.030 --> 55:45.350]  Can we get like a... can we get a picture of yours in the same format as mine,
[55:45.410 --> 55:46.990]  just before you eat it, so we know you've done it right?
[55:47.110 --> 55:47.730]  That's a great idea.
[55:47.790 --> 55:49.710]  What do you... no. No. No, you can't.
[55:49.710 --> 55:50.350]  Why not? Why?
[55:50.430 --> 55:55.710]  Because I don't have my phone around me. My desk is filled with, like, ingredients I could
[55:55.710 --> 55:57.970]  possibly use. I got a whole bunch of stuff.
[55:59.210 --> 56:00.970]  Stop trying to put other things on it.
[56:01.410 --> 56:04.070]  Just make a sandwich that looks like the picture he gave you,
[56:04.130 --> 56:05.690]  and then let us see a picture of that picture.
[56:05.750 --> 56:09.510]  Yeah, how hard is that? Go get your phone, take a picture of your cheese and pickle sandwich.
[56:10.010 --> 56:12.970]  I'm not even doing the... I'm just doing a corner of the bread,
[56:13.090 --> 56:16.690]  because I don't trust this yet. It's just a little... I could salvage...
[56:16.690 --> 56:17.770]  I could salvage the rest.
[56:17.770 --> 56:19.350]  You're making the corner of a sandwich?
[56:19.470 --> 56:19.810]  Well, I'm...
[56:19.810 --> 56:22.310]  You don't trust it? Are you afraid it's going to sleep with your girlfriend?
[56:22.610 --> 56:26.930]  No, no, no, no, no. This is perfectly good bread. I don't want to ruin it.
[56:26.950 --> 56:31.490]  So I took a small corner of cheese, and I put the stuff on the cheese.
[56:31.650 --> 56:33.370]  So I'm going to bite into the top left of it.
[56:33.370 --> 56:34.450]  I knew you would salad cream this.
[56:34.470 --> 56:34.970]  How am I salad creaming this?
[56:34.970 --> 56:35.890]  I knew you'd find a...
[56:35.890 --> 56:37.170]  No, this is... I'm trying it.
[56:37.170 --> 56:37.750]  You're not making the sandwich.
[56:37.750 --> 56:39.010]  Yes, I am. I just made...
[56:39.010 --> 56:40.690]  I'm going to take a bite of a sandwich.
[56:41.530 --> 56:44.530]  How are you going to make a corner of a sandwich? It's not going to balance right.
[56:44.630 --> 56:45.270]  It's going to fall apart.
[56:45.270 --> 56:47.390]  What do you mean? It's a full sandwich,
[56:47.510 --> 56:51.470]  and I'm just putting it in the area I'm biting into. It's no different.
[56:52.150 --> 56:52.570]  It's a...
[56:52.570 --> 56:53.150]  It's a sandwich.
[56:53.310 --> 56:54.330]  You said it was the corner.
[56:54.410 --> 56:55.030]  I said...
[56:55.030 --> 56:58.590]  He's only putting ingredients in the corner, but he's got two pieces of bread.
[56:58.770 --> 56:59.790]  Jesus Christ.
[57:00.750 --> 57:01.910]  It's like when you...
[57:01.910 --> 57:06.750]  It's like, Gavin, imagine you were sleeping between two pieces of bread,
[57:06.750 --> 57:11.430]  and the cheese and the Branston pickle were your inner sheet,
[57:11.850 --> 57:14.130]  and then the night you got too hot, you kicked them down.
[57:14.850 --> 57:16.630]  And they're at the bottom of the...
[57:16.630 --> 57:18.970]  They're at the bottom of the blanket sandwich.
[57:19.330 --> 57:24.470]  My sandwich looks identical to yours, Gavin, except my Branston and cheddar
[57:24.470 --> 57:26.790]  is just in the top left, and everything else is naked.
[57:27.470 --> 57:29.170]  How do we know? We can't see it.
[57:29.410 --> 57:34.250]  With the plan that if you hate it, you can still use the remaining three-cornered piece of bread.
[57:34.250 --> 57:36.730]  I can still use the rest of the bread to make something else I enjoy.
[57:36.750 --> 57:38.370]  I'm not wasting the bread.
[57:39.210 --> 57:42.250]  If I like it, I'll add more cheese and more Branston.
[57:42.530 --> 57:43.730]  It's not a hard thing.
[57:43.950 --> 57:44.870]  It'll stay balanced.
[57:45.670 --> 57:46.610]  Here we go.
[57:46.830 --> 57:47.150]  Wow.
[57:47.470 --> 57:51.230]  So you never throw away bread that's not eaten yet.
[57:51.450 --> 57:52.990]  You always eat all of your bread.
[57:53.110 --> 57:54.410]  This fucking sucks.
[58:00.950 --> 58:01.470]  Why?
[58:08.960 --> 58:10.440]  Oh, god, shit, my pants.
[58:10.540 --> 58:11.740]  It's gotta suck.
[58:11.880 --> 58:12.900]  It looks terrible.
[58:13.520 --> 58:14.360]  So gross.
[58:15.440 --> 58:18.220]  I'm like, oh, this is...
[58:18.220 --> 58:19.360]  I didn't even know you'd eat it.
[58:19.380 --> 58:20.260]  I just took a bite.
[58:21.900 --> 58:22.780]  It's awful.
[58:24.620 --> 58:27.300]  I regret buying so many things to try it with.
[58:27.360 --> 58:28.480]  I don't want to try this again.
[58:29.100 --> 58:29.960]  It looks...
[58:29.960 --> 58:31.580]  I didn't want to say it like this earlier,
[58:31.680 --> 58:34.640]  but it looks sometimes like when Arrow takes a shit in the yard,
[58:34.740 --> 58:36.520]  and I don't catch it before it rains.
[58:36.700 --> 58:39.100]  And then the rain just, like, hammers the shit down.
[58:39.180 --> 58:40.860]  That's what the Branston pickle looks like.
[58:42.020 --> 58:43.180]  Oh, my god.
[58:43.460 --> 58:44.600]  What's it taste like?
[58:44.600 --> 58:46.200]  Give us a review.
[58:46.360 --> 58:46.920]  Let's hear it.
[58:47.020 --> 58:49.000]  It's very sour and sweet.
[58:50.060 --> 58:50.960]  A lot of tang to it.
[58:52.100 --> 58:52.720]  And tangy.
[58:53.400 --> 58:53.740]  Texture?
[58:55.140 --> 58:55.990]  I can't tell...
[58:56.920 --> 58:58.160]  I don't even know how to answer that.
[58:58.220 --> 58:58.830]  What do you mean, like...
[58:59.900 --> 59:01.240]  Well, it should be very crunchy.
[59:01.480 --> 59:02.120]  No, it's not.
[59:02.180 --> 59:03.380]  I wouldn't describe it as crunchy.
[59:05.240 --> 59:06.040]  What are you eating?
[59:06.120 --> 59:07.500]  Did you get any of the actual bits?
[59:07.500 --> 59:08.580]  No, I did.
[59:08.740 --> 59:09.120]  I did.
[59:09.160 --> 59:10.040]  I got several of them.
[59:10.120 --> 59:11.320]  I ate the whole corner, Gavin.
[59:11.380 --> 59:12.000]  I covered it.
[59:13.200 --> 59:13.560]  Um...
[59:13.560 --> 59:16.620]  I'm getting the impression that maybe one corner wasn't enough for you to make a full assessment.
[59:16.620 --> 59:18.360]  I'm not taking another bite of it.
[59:18.440 --> 59:20.060]  I will gladly try it with a different thing.
[59:20.320 --> 59:21.940]  Here is my problem with your suggestion.
[59:22.400 --> 59:24.960]  I would never just eat a cheddar sandwich to begin with.
[59:25.580 --> 59:26.520]  I don't think I'd like...
[59:26.520 --> 59:27.300]  Yeah, I wouldn't, like...
[59:27.300 --> 59:28.400]  This isn't a thing I'd enjoy.
[59:29.520 --> 59:32.100]  Okay, so you want to maybe try it on a grilled cheese, then?
[59:32.160 --> 59:33.240]  I could try it that way.
[59:33.260 --> 59:35.000]  I got a few other items I could try it with.
[59:35.040 --> 59:36.920]  I have a bacon jerky.
[59:37.500 --> 59:38.340]  I could try it with that.
[59:39.840 --> 59:41.040]  That classic combination.
[59:41.040 --> 59:43.360]  Yeah, let's try a little dip of that.
[59:43.380 --> 59:44.320]  Oh, the old...
[59:44.320 --> 59:45.740]  The old Branstad and bacon.
[59:46.100 --> 59:46.260]  Yeah.
[59:47.300 --> 59:49.280]  Bacon jerky dipped in Branstad pickle.
[59:49.700 --> 59:51.180]  That actually is better than the sandwich.
[59:51.320 --> 59:53.600]  I enjoy that a lot more, the Branstad with the bacon jerky.
[59:54.320 --> 59:55.020]  I'm a fan of that.
[59:55.500 --> 59:56.100]  It's getting better.
[59:56.240 --> 59:56.360]  Yeah.
[59:57.480 --> 59:57.840]  Option...
[59:57.840 --> 59:58.620]  I don't know what I should do.
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.840]  An option two, I guess I'll go with the hot dog.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.100]  I got a hot dog here.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.300]  What the hell?
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.600]  Are you putting it on a hot dog?
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.840]  You can't just dip it in.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.500]  You're not going to get any of the crunch if you dip.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.780]  I need the crunch.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.420]  I need to...
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.820]  I don't know if I like the crunch though.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.180]  You got it.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.840]  No, you want to spoon it or knife it on to whatever you're eating.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.800]  Okay, I'll spoon it.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.580]  Jesus Christ.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:20.660]  Demands.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:21.600]  Branstad.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:22.620]  I'm doing a little...
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.220]  I did a little bit.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.780]  Okay, I'm going to get the crunch.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.520]  Bite into this hot dog.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:27.900]  That's fine.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.320]  That's fine.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.180]  That's better than the sandwich.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.040]  I think you offered me the thing I'd like at least on as the base test.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.520]  If anything, you salad cream this.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.900]  I've salad cream this.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.780]  I was just trying to give you a very...
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.000]  Those are strong words.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.440]  A very non-complex baseline.
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.940]  I do understand where he's coming from there.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:52.920]  The more steps you have to take, the greater the risk that you are going to fuck it up
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:53.840]  spectacularly.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.140]  That's a great.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.020]  So you like it as a hot dog?
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.100]  It's not bad as a hot dog condiment.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.660]  I'm going to do the last test.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:02.860]  Dippable.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.820]  What's the last test?
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:04.740]  The Kit Kat.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.080]  You got a Kit Kat scream.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:06.980]  That's not...
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.500]  That's not...
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.400]  That's not real.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.300]  You can't imagine that being any good.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.160]  That's not a real thing.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.060]  It's chocolatey.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.020]  It's going to be tangy.
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.480]  I think in my head, this makes sense.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.540]  I'm going to take a bite.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.000]  I'd never order this.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.920]  I'd never request this.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.520]  It's better than the sandwich.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.240]  This is better than the sandwich.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.640]  Where the fuck would you request that?
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.900]  Where would you ever find yourself in life when you would go,
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.860]  Hey, can I get you anything, Andrew?
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.060]  Or can I get you anything, sir?
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:32.580]  And you go,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.560]  You guys got a Kit Kat Branson pickle?
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.040]  We need to...
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.460]  The next article, we need to set up a little food trailer that just serves like
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.060]  muffins and bowls and Kit Kat dipped Branson.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.680]  Or Branson dipped Kit Kat.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.600]  If I was in a fallout shelter and I only had Branson and Kit Kats,
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.160]  I wouldn't combine them often.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.420]  But if I wanted to spice things up a little bit, I'd combine them.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.220]  I'd combine them maybe once a year.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.500]  It's not terrible.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.100]  I enjoyed it more than the sandwich.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.700]  I would never eat that sandwich.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.060]  That was a disgraceful sandwich.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:02.820]  Okay.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.040]  So I'm wondering if...
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.020]  I'm wondering if maybe the cheese baseline doesn't work for you being a Canadian.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.680]  You don't usually have a cheese sandwich.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.860]  Yeah, I would try maybe a grilled cheese next week.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.200]  I'm open to that.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.460]  I think I would enjoy it.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.420]  It's so hard to fuck up a grilled cheese, though.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.340]  No matter what you put on it, it's going to be okay.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.020]  You do it well.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:20.820]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:21.760]  That's a good point.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.700]  Maybe you should have like a turkey and provolone and Branson pickle.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.360]  Well, here's the...
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.700]  I ordered turkey.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.860]  This is all products that came from 7-Eleven, by the way.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.820]  I ordered...
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:40.580]  I got the official 7-Eleven cheddar, Wonder Bread, and the 7-Eleven bacon jerky hot dog.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.680]  I ordered turkey.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.100]  Uh, they didn't have any, so they just gave me ham.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.220]  I'm not a big ham person, so...
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.440]  Not a big ham guy?
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:54.160]  You're not a big ham guy considering we invented the ham zone and that we swim in it?
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:54.600]  That's...
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.400]  We're all ham fans?
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.120]  That's a great...
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.420]  Seriously?
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.440]  That's a great point.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.920]  It's sort of like mayo to me.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.620]  I like my ham to be sneaky.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.120]  I don't want to be aware that the ham is there.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.260]  I can understand that.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.260]  When it's bacon...
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.620]  You know when it looks like bacon bits?
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.940]  Like that style of Hawaiian pizza?
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:12.860]  I think it's great.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.040]  Yeah, like on a...
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:14.460]  Oh, really?
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:14.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.600]  I'm a fan of that.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.940]  Well, I'm glad that you could try the Branson.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:18.600]  I did.
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:19.840]  Yeah, I am too.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.320]  It was worth the probably 45 bucks it took to get that to you.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.720]  I gotta try and think...
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.660]  We'll leave it for maybe another 10 or so weeks,
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.160]  but I'll try and find another obscure British food to make you eat because I'm enjoying it.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.720]  I feel like we need to flip this.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.080]  I feel like I need to come up with a thing for you two to try.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.180]  I'm the guinea pig.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.540]  Yeah, send me a box of poutine or something.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.460]  I'll tell you what.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.380]  You sent me a 12-foot toilet.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.860]  I'll take a pass on the next one.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.000]  Gavin can have it.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.120]  Yeah, I haven't got anything yet.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.200]  I don't...
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.260]  Well, it's more complicated.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.300]  I don't know where you live.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.940]  You refuse to tell me.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.120]  You have to send it to me and then I take it to Gavin.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:57.360]  Yeah.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.540]  Uh, Eric's telling us we have to wrap up and stop talking to each other and that our friendship is...
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:05.960]  Okay, that's sad.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.020]  It goes fast, doesn't it?
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.400]  Yeah, just like that.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.240]  Oh, you know what, though?
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:09.800]  We do...
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.520]  There are a couple things I do want to show, um, or talk about.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.920]  Uh, one of them is...
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.660]  I don't know if you saw it yet, Gav, but Andrew hasn't.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:23.340]  Last episode that aired, at least, we asked the audience to very poorly roto in, uh,
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.080]  Don Zimmer over E.T. in, uh...
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.760]  Oh, it feels like so long ago now.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.560]  Yeah, that's...
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:28.860]  They did...
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.420]  They did that.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.400]  And I put it in the...
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.420]  I put it in the Discord.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.500]  It's just, uh, below the picture of Andrew.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.360]  If you guys want to watch that.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.200]  Okay, let me have a look.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.680]  Pretty, pretty adorable.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:37.480]  Let's open that.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.520]  I don't know why I didn't click this earlier.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.420]  I've been here the whole time.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.820]  I'm just stuck in a loading screen.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.080]  Um...
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.020]  That was Sarklad at GeckoGeek6.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:49.700]  It was very fun.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.640]  Oh, here we go.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:51.400]  Transition.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:55.440]  Okay.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.380]  It works, right?
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:04:59.920]  Yeah.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.180]  And then...
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.400]  It's not seamless, but it works.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.480]  We didn't want it.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.120]  We didn't want it to be.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:06.740]  Yeah.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.880]  And then I, uh...
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.320]  I...
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.140]  I want to send you guys a picture of this.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.820]  Check this out.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.280]  That should be in the chat now.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.200]  Oh!
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.040]  We got these.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.940]  We got these in the mail.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:16.500]  Yes.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.020]  From a user.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:18.920]  Uh, and I...
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.980]  Unfortunately, I don't have the...
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.840]  their name with me.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.160]  They also sent a bunch of really cool old baseball cards.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.860]  But I have yours and Nick's and Gavin's.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.040]  Wow.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.660]  And Eric's.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.880]  And I have no intention of getting them to you.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.480]  So I have six of these, I think.
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.500]  Or five or six of these.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.520]  That's amazing.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.840]  I'm certainly not going to put them in the mail to Canada.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.120]  So...
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.460]  Put it on your bike and drop it off.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:40.680]  Yeah.
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.980]  If it is ever at all convenient to me, I saved the...
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.400]  Actually, what I did was I opened the box and I took mine out.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.680]  I realized there was stuff for you guys.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.980]  Then I just put it back in the box and threw it in my trunk.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.400]  So what I could just do was throw it back in the mail at Rooster Teeth
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.220]  and let them figure it out.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.380]  But anyway, they exist and they're out there somewhere.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.360]  And I encourage you guys to find out a way to get yours
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.560]  because they are phenomenal.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:00.700]  These giant...
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.520]  We'll put it on the Instagram.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.860]  But these giant f*** face pencils with a bite taken out of them.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:07.180]  And on the back, they say like they're numbered of six.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:07.840]  So I...
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.720]  I feel like that's better than anything we've sold.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:10.740]  It's pretty...
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.740]  Pretty f***ing good.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.080]  And we should probably look into it.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.740]  So anyway, I don't have that user's name in front of me.
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.720]  I will be sure that we thank them in the future.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.580]  I'm sorry, that comment leaver.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.360]  And then I took the weirdest...
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:23.560]  I took...
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.080]  I was taking a selfie and it came out weird.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.260]  And I was wondering if you guys know anything...
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.500]  Notice anything weird about myself?
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.060]  Oh, that's so disturbing.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:33.740]  That's great.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.340]  It's like too high up on the neck.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:35.800]  I know.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:37.600]  I...
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.520]  Right before we started the podcast, the mail came and I got my Don Zimmer fan.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.020]  So I took his...
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:47.640]  What I did...
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.920]  I'll put it on the Instagram as well.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:49.800]  I'll have it put on it.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:53.260]  But I just took a selfie where I replaced my face with Don Zimmer's.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.800]  And his head is like 80% cheeks.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.380]  I don't know how he does it.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.980]  Dude, that thing was not cheap.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.040]  I had to pay like $40 for it because I had...
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.380]  He autographed this forehead there.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.480]  Oh, that's a real Don Zimmer autograph?
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.780]  Yeah, it came with a certificate of authenticity.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:08.980]  Wow.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:09.960]  I didn't want it.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.040]  I just wanted his head for like five bucks.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:12.960]  But that was the only...
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.980]  Sir, your signature is ruining the fan.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:27.020]  It's gotta be one of the grossest things made about and for a celebrity.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.220]  It's not nice.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.660]  He looks pasty in it.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.620]  His eyes are half closed.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:34.460]  It's just...
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.120]  It looks like he didn't do a special photo shoot for it.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.480]  Someone was just like, Don.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.480]  And he was like, huh?
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.620]  And then they took a picture.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.900]  He was tired.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.460]  He just had a nap.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.140]  He turned around.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.260]  Anyway, so it's phenomenal.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.900]  So that's all I wanted to show you guys.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.020]  Oh, that's great.
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:50.340]  Love it.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:50.640]  Yeah.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.240]  How do you feel about that one, Geoff?
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.320]  Was that a good episode?
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.440]  How do you feel about it?
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.640]  What's your review of this one?
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.260]  All right.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.660]  If you want to get into it.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:58.720]  Yeah.
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:07:59.000]  All right.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:07:59.900]  Here's the form.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.540]  Here's the survey.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.100]  Here's what I was...
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.020]  Here's what I was thinking.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.680]  I thought it was a really good episode.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.820]  I was really happy with all of it, but one part.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.480]  And I was going to call Gavin out or text Gavin after and see what he thought.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.680]  But we can do it here.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:24.740]  I think that my telling of the stand up face I did where I didn't prepare and I had to do the 20
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.380]  minute stand up.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.780]  I think that that was...
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:28.240]  I think that story was a little dry.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.160]  No, it was an emotional journey.
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:30.720]  Are you kidding me?
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.520]  No, I was...
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.040]  Geoff, I was feeling your anxiety in that.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:34.880]  Yeah, that was great.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:35.900]  It was an A plus.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:36.140]  Yeah.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.380]  That's good, man.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:37.660]  Thanks.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.640]  Because I was feeling pretty...
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.900]  I was feeling pretty down on that one.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:40.220]  No.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.520]  I appreciate that.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.160]  Yeah.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.060]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.100]  Because I was like, man, I just...
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.000]  I felt like I was dragging.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.980]  No, not at all.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:49.860]  Fantastic.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.440]  All right.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:51.860]  Well, thanks.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.440]  I mean, if anything, you should feel bad about the weird ending that you've given us now.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:00.220]  Well, usually I give you this ending after, but you wanted to do it here.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.920]  You wanted to fill out the comment cards, so we're filling out the comment cards.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.260]  I usually have this spiral 15 minutes from now, but that's okay.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.260]  It was great.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.880]  All right, let's end it.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:12.080]  Yeah.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:12.500]  All right.
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.560]  It was lovely talking to you two idiots.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.820]  Thank you for listening.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.120]  This has been episode 49 of F*** Face.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.900]  We would really appreciate it if you would give us a like and a review and tell your friends
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:30.040]  and buy a t-shirt or a baseball bat or a knob or I don't know, something.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:30.900]  Or not.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.540]  I don't give a f***.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.100]  Just listen to another episode.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:33.800]  Or don't.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.140]  Whatever.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.040]  It's a free country.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.940]  If you're listening from America, you figure it out.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:37.920]  See you next week.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.240]  Bye.
