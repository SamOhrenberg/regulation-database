[00:00.000 --> 00:03.060]  Mom, Dad, my body is growing at an alarming rate.
[00:03.440 --> 00:07.220]  And the clothes you buy me now will be very small, very soon.
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.640]  But your wallet doesn't have to suffer because of fashion,
[00:09.780 --> 00:11.780]  with the low prices of Amazon's back-to-school.
[00:12.660 --> 00:14.780]  Amazon, spend less, smile more.

[00:48.760 --> 00:52.680]  Are you guys talking about, like, regional drinks or, like, regional things?
[00:53.060 --> 00:53.700]  Because I got one.
[00:53.880 --> 00:57.960]  Well, the problem is I'm trying all this bullshit that Gavin is sending that's atrocious.
[00:58.120 --> 00:59.360]  I'm eating the Branston pickle.
[00:59.700 --> 01:00.980]  I'm eating the salad cream.
[01:00.980 --> 01:05.160]  I need to find something Canadian that I can make him eat.
[01:05.300 --> 01:07.280]  The problem is everything's just good.
[01:07.720 --> 01:09.820]  Or, like, at least, like, average.
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.560]  Like, it's just all snack foods.
[01:11.780 --> 01:13.180]  Yeah, it's like, get a load of this.
[01:13.700 --> 01:14.100]  Poutine.
[01:15.900 --> 01:17.460]  Canada dried ginger ale.
[01:17.760 --> 01:18.940]  Like, the best ginger ale.
[01:20.140 --> 01:22.240]  What a terrible thing for him to experience.
[01:22.560 --> 01:24.960]  And also just isn't different enough than, like, North America.
[01:25.440 --> 01:26.580]  The snacks are just similar.
[01:27.020 --> 01:30.780]  I'm searching craziest Canadian snack and the first thing that comes up is all-dressed chips.
[01:31.220 --> 01:31.660]  Wow.
[01:31.820 --> 01:32.800]  All right, that's not...
[01:32.800 --> 01:35.020]  That's, like, the lameness of Canada.
[01:35.380 --> 01:37.500]  The lack of... it's like we got all dressed.
[01:37.700 --> 01:38.660]  Look at us being zany.
[01:38.680 --> 01:39.800]  Dill pickle chips?
[01:40.380 --> 01:41.820]  Taffy on the snow?
[01:42.220 --> 01:42.880]  That doesn't sound...
[01:42.880 --> 01:44.780]  I don't know what taffy on the snow is.
[01:45.300 --> 01:47.740]  I know what a snowflake bar is.
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.200]  I don't know what taffy on the snow is.
[01:49.280 --> 01:50.100]  Butter tarts?
[01:50.340 --> 01:51.320]  Montreal bagels?
[01:51.820 --> 01:53.000]  Do you remember York bars?
[01:53.820 --> 01:55.480]  I haven't had a York bar in a long time.
[01:55.600 --> 01:56.320]  It's a York bar.
[01:57.260 --> 02:00.640]  They used to brand themselves as, like, a man's chocolate bar.
[02:00.640 --> 02:02.880]  Oh, that was a mistake.
[02:03.160 --> 02:04.020]  That's a British thing.
[02:04.080 --> 02:06.780]  We didn't have that here, but I learned about it a while ago.
[02:07.020 --> 02:07.060]  Okay.
[02:07.140 --> 02:09.580]  Where it's like, this is a chocolate bar for guys.
[02:09.680 --> 02:11.040]  No women allowed.
[02:11.560 --> 02:11.740]  Yeah.
[02:11.940 --> 02:13.900]  That's a Yorkie bar, not a York bar.
[02:14.360 --> 02:15.720]  It's not a York bar?
[02:16.200 --> 02:16.640]  Yorkie.
[02:17.180 --> 02:17.560]  York.
[02:17.740 --> 02:19.000]  Let me look up York bar.
[02:19.080 --> 02:21.040]  I feel like it's just a York on the package.
[02:21.420 --> 02:22.380]  Also, hi Gavin, how are you?
[02:23.060 --> 02:23.360]  Hi.
[02:23.540 --> 02:24.380]  It's like, Yorkie.
[02:24.620 --> 02:25.480]  No girls.
[02:26.040 --> 02:26.720]  York bar.
[02:26.720 --> 02:29.060]  Uh, York.
[02:29.200 --> 02:31.140]  But if you Google York bar...
[02:31.140 --> 02:32.460]  Yeah, I get barbells.
[02:32.580 --> 02:33.360]  Yeah, it's...
[02:33.360 --> 02:34.660]  I feel like I made a mistake.
[02:34.680 --> 02:34.920]  Yeah.
[02:35.500 --> 02:36.700]  I was thinking it's Yorkie.
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.000]  I search York bar, and it's just a lot of bars that are, like, arcade bars or a place called York bar.
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.160]  Oh, Yorkie.
[02:45.220 --> 02:47.580]  I'm looking at a bar that says Yorkie on it.
[02:47.760 --> 02:48.240]  So I think that's...
[02:48.240 --> 02:51.300]  They have, like, a no women in the O, and it's, like, it's not for women.
[02:53.080 --> 02:54.820]  What happens if a woman eats it?
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.540]  They're not allowed to, Geoff.
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.060]  What if they break the rules?
[02:58.360 --> 02:58.600]  Nah.
[02:58.820 --> 02:59.520]  They would never.
[02:59.900 --> 03:00.460]  That's fair.
[03:01.460 --> 03:02.060]  Oh, God.
[03:02.200 --> 03:02.700]  There it is.
[03:03.140 --> 03:05.340]  Is it good? Does it taste like men's stuff?
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.420]  I don't know. You'll never know.
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.100]  I got one upstairs.
[03:08.100 --> 03:09.460]  It's a masculine bar. It's fine.
[03:09.460 --> 03:10.200]  You have one upstairs?
[03:10.680 --> 03:13.260]  Yeah, I imported a bunch of Yorkie about a year ago.
[03:13.660 --> 03:14.580]  What did Meg think of them?
[03:14.760 --> 03:14.900]  Oh, shit.
[03:17.280 --> 03:18.860]  I wouldn't even tempt her with them.
[03:23.440 --> 03:24.760]  Boy, you just passed that test.
[03:24.780 --> 03:25.300]  Yeah, good job.
[03:25.300 --> 03:27.140]  All right, are we rolling all around? We all good to go?
[03:27.500 --> 03:27.600]  Yeah.
[03:27.720 --> 03:29.100]  I think we started a while ago, didn't we?
[03:29.140 --> 03:32.020]  Uh, no, I don't think so. But, uh, we can start now.
[03:32.400 --> 03:32.660]  Cats are good.
[03:32.660 --> 03:33.920]  Why would an ape shit?
[03:34.220 --> 03:34.900]  Because they want to start?
[03:36.500 --> 03:37.480]  Did you hear that?
[03:37.840 --> 03:38.080]  No.
[03:38.120 --> 03:38.300]  No.
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.280]  What were they doing?
[03:40.620 --> 03:44.160]  Oh, Smee and Q were just rolling around, like, tackling each other's heads and stuff.
[03:45.020 --> 03:46.260]  Do you think, uh...
[03:48.300 --> 03:48.620]  Yeah.
[03:49.700 --> 03:50.480]  Are you okay?
[03:50.580 --> 03:51.180]  Is that all you got, Geoff?
[03:51.180 --> 03:52.460]  Are you still there? Geoff?
[03:52.500 --> 03:52.980]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[03:53.120 --> 03:53.260]  What?
[03:53.380 --> 03:54.840]  He's still thinking about it. What just happened?
[03:54.840 --> 03:55.780]  What happened?
[03:56.620 --> 04:00.240]  I realized I said, do you think, and then I didn't know what was behind it.
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.860]  And then I thought, why don't I just let you guys fill in,
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.520]  and then I don't want to do all the heavy lifting.
[04:04.660 --> 04:07.260]  So I, uh, I just figured you guys would pick it up at some point.
[04:07.440 --> 04:09.160]  You just thought we'd take the silence and be like,
[04:09.180 --> 04:11.120]  that wasn't weird, and we would just continue talking.
[04:11.280 --> 04:12.560]  I was hoping so, yeah.
[04:12.800 --> 04:15.580]  Now, to be fair, I just assumed you had tech issues.
[04:15.760 --> 04:16.060]  Ah.
[04:16.180 --> 04:17.580]  Because it's you.
[04:18.260 --> 04:18.560]  Yeah.
[04:18.680 --> 04:19.520]  Yeah, that's possible.
[04:19.680 --> 04:20.400]  No, it checks out.
[04:20.780 --> 04:23.540]  Do you do that? Do you ever, like, start a sentence to, like,
[04:23.540 --> 04:25.880]  lean into something without knowing what the thing is,
[04:25.960 --> 04:27.000]  and then you never find the thing?
[04:27.080 --> 04:29.680]  We should start the podcast before we start the sentence, though.
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.120]  Most of them are like, we started the podcast way, like, 255.
[04:33.160 --> 04:33.960]  We were talking about Yorkies.
[04:34.080 --> 04:35.640]  What? That wasn't the podcast, surely?
[04:36.260 --> 04:37.020]  I'm pretty sure it was.
[04:37.220 --> 04:40.240]  I don't know when we started, but we definitely started.
[04:40.620 --> 04:42.080]  Okay, what episode is this?
[04:42.460 --> 04:43.580]  51, I believe, right?
[04:43.840 --> 04:44.160]  51.
[04:44.740 --> 04:47.760]  That means next week, the fire extinguisher.
[04:48.180 --> 04:50.720]  I need to, maybe, possibly.
[04:51.320 --> 04:53.060]  You've had so many weeks to be like,
[04:53.060 --> 04:54.960]  I gotta work stuff out, gotta work stuff out.
[04:55.020 --> 04:58.380]  Yeah, I do. I gotta buy things, Gav. It's not easy.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.640]  Why don't you fucking launch a fire extinguisher if it's so easy?
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.920]  You deal with it. You own the place you live in.
[05:05.060 --> 05:07.200]  It would make more sense for you to do it than me.
[05:07.720 --> 05:09.600]  What do you mean? You're really aggressive.
[05:10.120 --> 05:13.100]  No, it's, well, I'm getting fucking harassed about fire extinguishers,
[05:13.160 --> 05:15.060]  we're however many minutes into this podcast.
[05:15.280 --> 05:17.640]  I'm just worried about next week coming around and suddenly, like,
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.860]  something didn't arrive because I waited until yesterday
[05:19.860 --> 05:22.180]  to order a fire extinguisher catcher bag.
[05:22.180 --> 05:24.040]  I know, I need a lot of things.
[05:24.140 --> 05:28.240]  You don't understand the level of elaborate it would take for me to set this up.
[05:28.500 --> 05:28.740]  I need ladders.
[05:28.740 --> 05:30.540]  Would or will? Would or will?
[05:30.860 --> 05:33.380]  Well, we'll find out. I guess we'll find out next week.
[05:33.660 --> 05:34.760]  I guess we'll find out next week.
[05:35.220 --> 05:35.980]  Do you need some chow mein?
[05:36.520 --> 05:39.020]  Do I need chow mein? I could always use some chow mein.
[05:40.060 --> 05:43.340]  There's no scenario that becomes worse with the addition of chow mein.
[05:44.100 --> 05:47.280]  I want to see a fire extinguisher that shoots chow mein.
[05:48.580 --> 05:51.020]  Ooh, like pressurized chow mein.
[05:51.020 --> 05:54.380]  That's one step up from the Keurig with the noodles.
[05:54.860 --> 05:55.060]  Yeah.
[05:55.240 --> 05:58.960]  If you could put anything in a fire extinguisher that wasn't for extinguishing fires,
[05:59.020 --> 05:59.780]  what would you put in it?
[06:00.000 --> 06:01.140]  What would be your go-to item?
[06:02.140 --> 06:02.540]  Whipped cream.
[06:02.900 --> 06:03.580]  Whipped cream?
[06:04.040 --> 06:06.540]  Whipped cream. Whipped cream already comes out of a pressurized can.
[06:06.640 --> 06:07.660]  I know, it's fucking awesome.
[06:07.800 --> 06:10.920]  And I eat it straight out of the can three or four times a day.
[06:11.220 --> 06:15.320]  So imagine if I don't have to, if, like, if I have a mega-sized...
[06:15.320 --> 06:17.560]  I'm not looking for a fire extinguisher that shoots anything.
[06:17.560 --> 06:23.400]  I'm looking for a whipped cream can the size of a fire extinguisher that I can put in my fridge.
[06:23.860 --> 06:24.940]  It has a nozzle that I can...
[06:24.940 --> 06:25.900]  So, because it's heavy, right?
[06:25.960 --> 06:26.760]  You don't want to lift it up.
[06:26.940 --> 06:29.680]  So you get it wedged in there, and then you have the little nozzle.
[06:29.820 --> 06:31.800]  You can, like, fucking snake it out of the...
[06:34.460 --> 06:36.820]  That's the answer of, like, an eight-year-old child.
[06:36.840 --> 06:37.600]  That's, like, big.
[06:37.720 --> 06:39.200]  That's like the kid becomes Tom Hanks.
[06:39.400 --> 06:42.520]  He gets a vending machine and a trampoline and a giant can of whipped cream.
[06:42.940 --> 06:43.260]  Yeah.
[06:43.600 --> 06:44.460]  How about you guys?
[06:44.660 --> 06:45.700]  Come up with something better than that.
[06:45.700 --> 06:46.460]  I don't...
[06:46.460 --> 06:48.360]  Well, what do you typically put whipped cream on?
[06:48.500 --> 06:49.840]  Uh, I put it on my mouth, man.
[06:51.420 --> 06:56.000]  I just, like, try to fill a hot chocolate, like, just top it off with all the liquid
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.720]  shoots out because you're just blasting it at full speed.
[06:58.860 --> 06:59.580]  Like, it wouldn't...
[06:59.580 --> 07:01.240]  It's not practical in any way.
[07:01.420 --> 07:02.000]  I love it.
[07:02.200 --> 07:06.460]  You just have a cup that used to have hot chocolate and a bunch of brown shit everywhere.
[07:07.500 --> 07:10.540]  I'd probably do something really disturbing, like blood or something.
[07:10.740 --> 07:11.620]  Like, my blood.
[07:12.000 --> 07:12.760]  That's horrifying.
[07:13.520 --> 07:14.060]  Whose blood?
[07:14.060 --> 07:19.060]  Well, because I was thinking of something that would be weird, but also useful in an emergency.
[07:19.320 --> 07:24.200]  So if my blood was in it and I needed a transfusion, I could be like, get that fire extinguisher.
[07:24.960 --> 07:26.760]  And just coat you in it?
[07:26.980 --> 07:28.720]  Fill some cups with it.
[07:28.760 --> 07:29.540]  Open wide!
[07:29.900 --> 07:33.800]  But the splash would be... it would be traumatic to look at afterwards.
[07:35.460 --> 07:37.780]  I don't think that's how blood transfusion works.
[07:37.780 --> 07:41.180]  I don't think that'd be at all helpful.
[07:41.880 --> 07:45.800]  I need a lot of blood, and I need it in me all at once.
[07:46.040 --> 07:49.020]  Yeah, don't worry. We don't need... we don't need to transfuse anything.
[07:49.220 --> 07:52.160]  I have this fire extinguisher of my own blood.
[07:52.440 --> 07:54.320]  It's just that you feel free to use it.
[07:54.320 --> 07:57.240]  It's so powerful, it just shoots blood into your skin.
[07:58.360 --> 07:59.260]  That's horrifying!
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.240]  I like Geoff's way better.
[08:02.380 --> 08:03.040]  But useful?
[08:03.620 --> 08:04.660]  No, it's not useful.
[08:04.660 --> 08:07.800]  There's no way in which... there's no scenario that's useful.
[08:07.860 --> 08:10.140]  How long does blood keep under pressure?
[08:10.660 --> 08:12.780]  Okay, it is useful, and here's why.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.320]  When I was in the army, which I realized was a long, long time ago,
[08:16.420 --> 08:18.200]  and technology's probably changed.
[08:18.560 --> 08:21.160]  But when I was in the army, and we went through basic training,
[08:21.280 --> 08:24.400]  we had to get a battery of vaccines and shots, right?
[08:24.760 --> 08:27.540]  Like, this is before the world was scared of vaccines again for a while.
[08:27.640 --> 08:30.480]  And it was like, I had to get measles, mumps, rubella,
[08:30.480 --> 08:35.880]  uh, uh, yellow fever, typhoid, tetanus, all this stuff, right?
[08:36.200 --> 08:39.120]  Like, and every time I had to go anywhere, I'd have to get 37 more shots, too.
[08:39.440 --> 08:41.120]  They'd be like, you need a malaria 7 shot.
[08:41.180 --> 08:42.580]  And I'm like, but I got one through six last week.
[08:42.600 --> 08:44.960]  And they're like, well, you're going to a malaria 7 region.
[08:46.760 --> 08:48.240]  It was just constant shots in the military.
[08:48.500 --> 08:51.340]  But in basic training, they used this thing that was,
[08:51.540 --> 08:53.000]  instead of having to deal with needles and stuff,
[08:53.160 --> 08:57.220]  they just had this gun that shot pressurized medicine into you.
[08:57.500 --> 08:58.820]  Shit, like a pressure hose?
[08:58.880 --> 08:59.720]  Like, it's really powerful?
[08:59.720 --> 09:01.260]  Yeah, it was like a pressure needle.
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.360]  And they would tell you, like, if you move, you will slice your arm open.
[09:05.540 --> 09:06.580]  Because it'll just cut through you.
[09:06.700 --> 09:10.180]  But if you hold perfectly still, it'll just, it's just like a needle.
[09:10.460 --> 09:12.960]  Just like, zoop, hurts the same, feels the same.
[09:13.140 --> 09:15.840]  But, uh, it's just like, it's just like fucking pressurized.
[09:15.920 --> 09:17.420]  So you could do something like that,
[09:17.820 --> 09:21.260]  where you shot a bunch of pressurized blood into you all at once.
[09:21.400 --> 09:22.040]  There you go.
[09:22.180 --> 09:25.040]  I'll just put an adapter on the end of the fire extinguisher,
[09:25.100 --> 09:28.120]  make it sort of needle width, straight in.
[09:28.180 --> 09:29.020]  Don't even have to wash it.
[09:29.020 --> 09:30.520]  Can give everyone my blood back to back.
[09:30.580 --> 09:31.520]  That sounds perfect.
[09:31.640 --> 09:32.040]  That is.
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.860]  Gotta take it down to the fire department and get it recharged every six months.
[09:37.360 --> 09:40.360]  Just go and sit and drip into it for about eight hours.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.080]  Eric says fire.
[09:43.320 --> 09:43.880]  I mean, that's good.
[09:43.980 --> 09:45.360]  I mean, yeah, it's a good one.
[09:45.740 --> 09:48.880]  I think I'd want, like, peanut butter, maybe jam.
[09:48.980 --> 09:49.360]  Peanut butter?
[09:49.900 --> 09:51.540]  Yeah, like a thing. I don't know.
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.120]  I just don't see how that would come out well.
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.140]  It's so thick, like it would be...
[09:56.140 --> 09:58.600]  I hate using a knife just to spread peanut butter.
[09:58.600 --> 10:00.480]  Feels like a waste for cleaning it.
[10:00.540 --> 10:06.380]  You know that scene in Jurassic Park where Newman from Seinfeld gets, like,
[10:06.760 --> 10:08.340]  gacked on by the dinosaur.
[10:08.600 --> 10:09.500]  He, like, hits him in the chest.
[10:09.680 --> 10:11.700]  I assume the peanut butter would come out like that.
[10:11.800 --> 10:13.560]  In just, like, thick balls.
[10:14.480 --> 10:16.160]  I have a lot of...
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.300]  I interact with peanut butter pretty significantly in my life on a day-to-day basis.
[10:23.260 --> 10:26.880]  In that I have to give dogs medicine with peanut butter every day.
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.020]  And then I make a smoothie for my daughter, typically, with peanut butter in it.
[10:31.100 --> 10:32.400]  And then I eat...
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.620]  I have my own jar of peanut...
[10:33.620 --> 10:34.720]  Well, it's for me and the dogs.
[10:34.840 --> 10:38.280]  But I eat just peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon, because that's gross.
[10:38.940 --> 10:42.620]  That's why it's just for me and the dogs, so I don't taint any other humans with it.
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.100]  But I gotta say, man, because of how much peanut butter I eat,
[10:46.380 --> 10:47.960]  I clean up a lot of peanut butter.
[10:48.320 --> 10:50.220]  And peanut butter is a fucking mess.
[10:50.800 --> 10:51.740]  And I can't...
[10:51.740 --> 10:54.880]  I don't think you would want it pressurized and sprayed anywhere.
[10:55.020 --> 10:56.740]  It's a nightmare to clean up.
[10:56.740 --> 11:00.140]  I also worry how it would separate in the canister, because it gets...
[11:00.140 --> 11:04.200]  Sometimes the oil gets its own layer, and you might just throw oil at someone first.
[11:04.480 --> 11:08.380]  It's like when Bernie would always buy that fancy peanut butter that's supposed to be better,
[11:08.500 --> 11:09.480]  but it really just makes you work.
[11:09.480 --> 11:11.020]  Oh, the stuff that's, like, real.
[11:11.300 --> 11:13.300]  It's made from just smashed peanuts.
[11:13.780 --> 11:15.800]  He's like, hold up a second, you guys want some healthy peanut butter?
[11:15.900 --> 11:18.760]  Give me 30 minutes to fucking sit here and...
[11:18.760 --> 11:19.320]  What do you call it?
[11:19.740 --> 11:20.280]  Stir it?
[11:21.480 --> 11:22.760]  I forgot the word stir.
[11:23.020 --> 11:26.120]  I had a butter churn stuck in my head,
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.740]  and I was trying to think of the word churn.
[11:28.740 --> 11:30.880]  And then stir was out the window.
[11:32.420 --> 11:35.240]  Man, speaking of a gross food,
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.520]  we're getting a lot of grief from people about the whole cheese sandwich thing.
[11:39.840 --> 11:40.480]  A lot of grief.
[11:40.980 --> 11:41.260]  Really?
[11:41.460 --> 11:42.620]  And I have a question...
[11:42.620 --> 11:43.620]  Basically, it's just...
[11:43.620 --> 11:47.220]  It's divided the comment leavers, because obviously all the English people are like...
[11:47.700 --> 11:50.780]  Yeah, cheese sandwich is a classic, basic sandwich.
[11:51.080 --> 11:52.900]  And everyone else is like, who would eat that cold?
[11:53.240 --> 11:54.360]  I have a question for you, Andrew.
[11:54.360 --> 11:56.060]  Do you have the Branston still?
[11:56.440 --> 11:59.280]  I mean, not near me, but yeah, I still have it.
[11:59.440 --> 12:00.540]  That's a no. He threw it away.
[12:01.060 --> 12:03.480]  No, I have it. It's just, it's not in my little fridge.
[12:03.720 --> 12:04.800]  Oh, so you can't just grab it?
[12:04.980 --> 12:06.040]  No, I can't just grab it.
[12:06.440 --> 12:07.760]  Okay, let me do a picture for you.
[12:08.060 --> 12:12.100]  Okay. I still don't... I would never eat that sandwich.
[12:12.900 --> 12:15.100]  I don't think you'd even put it in... Where would you rank that?
[12:15.520 --> 12:16.720]  It's not a top 10 sandwich.
[12:16.840 --> 12:18.080]  Do you see what it says in green?
[12:18.500 --> 12:19.500]  I... Yeah, I do see it.
[12:24.880 --> 12:27.140]  I don't know if that proves that.
[12:27.580 --> 12:31.320]  I just feel good about that. I feel like I'm not off base.
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.380]  It says it on the jar.
[12:33.420 --> 12:34.540]  No. What does it say, Andrew?
[12:35.200 --> 12:37.460]  Oh, it says, perfect in a cheese sandwich.
[12:37.860 --> 12:38.360]  There you go.
[12:38.940 --> 12:42.920]  Does it say hot melted cheese? No, it just says a cheese sandwich.
[12:43.720 --> 12:49.380]  I gotta say, Gav, you said you've been getting a lot of hate from the comment leavers about it.
[12:49.460 --> 12:52.660]  I feel like Andrew and I have been getting a lot of hate from the comment leavers too.
[12:52.800 --> 12:54.100]  It's a pretty divisive issue.
[12:54.100 --> 12:57.780]  I felt like most people are like, a cheese sandwich is completely reasonable.
[12:57.900 --> 13:00.380]  How do they not understand what it is or would want it?
[13:00.380 --> 13:04.620]  It's mixed, but there are a lot of people saying who would eat that, but you know, it's a classic.
[13:05.100 --> 13:09.200]  I think it's an established thing, but once again, it's a shit sandwich.
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.320]  It's not a great sandwich in any way. You wouldn't take it in your top...
[13:13.320 --> 13:17.100]  Firstly, it's weird that an opinion could be wrong, but we've just had evidence of it right there.
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.380]  And secondly, I do feel like my picture of the cheese sandwich didn't do it justice,
[13:21.380 --> 13:25.120]  because I'm using just the best cheddar I could find, and it came in slices.
[13:25.380 --> 13:27.640]  Like you don't usually have cheddar pre-sliced like that.
[13:27.700 --> 13:29.960]  You usually want to just hack it off a big old block.
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.380]  But yeah, and I did put a lot of Branson on. I should own up to that as well.
[13:34.680 --> 13:35.420]  Slightly too much.
[13:36.100 --> 13:39.780]  What is that pink Pringles can back there with Asian letters?
[13:40.880 --> 13:45.640]  Meg actually just bought like 10 different flavors of Japanese Pringles,
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.840]  and they're apparently all flavors that don't exist elsewhere.
[13:48.840 --> 13:51.740]  So we're gonna do a test. A taste test.
[13:52.360 --> 13:54.440]  I see. Whatever it is, I bet it's gross.
[13:55.080 --> 13:55.800]  Yeah, I bet it is.
[13:58.700 --> 14:01.800]  Hey, but before we get too far in here,
[14:02.840 --> 14:04.800]  I was looking at my notes, and I don't really have a lot,
[14:05.220 --> 14:09.180]  but the biggest thing I have is I want to know what happened in the bet.
[14:10.540 --> 14:11.660]  Take it away, Andrew.
[14:11.980 --> 14:15.380]  We have... Okay, so we last episode, we initiated the bet.
[14:15.720 --> 14:17.940]  Gavin said that he had beaten a time.
[14:17.940 --> 14:22.240]  I don't remember what you said exactly, so it feels weird to try to repeat what you said.
[14:22.740 --> 14:28.040]  The point is the bet started, and we had a miscommunication about the bet,
[14:28.240 --> 14:31.440]  but I have just sort of owned up to the fact that I think I'm wrong.
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.000]  I'm most likely wrong, just historically. I probably just don't remember it correctly.
[14:36.260 --> 14:38.640]  Gavin said he beat a time, or that time was on the board.
[14:39.160 --> 14:43.720]  He did not tell me which one it was, and I thought he was being sneaky,
[14:44.200 --> 14:46.440]  because he had a few different times that were better than mine,
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.800]  and I thought it was like, oh, you got to try to figure it out yourself.
[14:49.080 --> 14:53.320]  Turns out he just, in his memory, all the times he had were on the board,
[14:53.420 --> 14:56.040]  and to me, he had to pick a specific one before he would initiate.
[14:56.500 --> 14:58.260]  That's kind of where we left off with that.
[14:58.260 --> 15:02.580]  See, my memory of the bet was that you were just going to have all better times than me,
[15:02.740 --> 15:05.900]  so I thought, well, I'll try and beat one, and maybe I'll just do a couple,
[15:06.020 --> 15:10.580]  so that I knock him off a couple, and then you're having to clamber back up to the point where
[15:10.580 --> 15:13.200]  every single time you have is better than every single time I have.
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.880]  Yeah, I remember it as you picking a specific one, but that's probably wrong.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.960]  See, I always thought I wasn't even going to tell you which one. I was just going to announce,
[15:22.100 --> 15:24.400]  like, by the way, I've got a better time. Bye!
[15:24.820 --> 15:29.060]  I don't remember it coming up one way or the other, but I do remember there being
[15:29.060 --> 15:34.640]  some mystery involved where Gavin is like, time has been beaten, figure it out,
[15:34.740 --> 15:38.320]  and then you have to go and go through all the different levels to try to figure out
[15:38.320 --> 15:44.660]  which time or times he's beaten. That feels really true to me, but I cannot remember if we
[15:44.660 --> 15:50.180]  specified one or more. I don't think it came up. That's what I think, yeah. I think that I just
[15:50.180 --> 15:54.860]  never considered the possibility of doing multiples in my memory. I think, like, technically,
[15:55.020 --> 15:58.940]  in my head, it was always just one-on-one, but I could be totally wrong. Gavin's going to play
[15:58.940 --> 16:04.020]  a clip next week of me saying, I'll beat all your times within a night. But in my head,
[16:04.620 --> 16:10.280]  it was always a rally of one time back and forth until we couldn't beat it. So he
[16:10.700 --> 16:15.820]  immediately beat one of the times, and then I was like, oh, I think my best time was actually
[16:16.440 --> 16:21.720]  outskirts in Halo 2. So Andrew's like, well, so we had that whole thing. We put the clock on
[16:21.720 --> 16:26.120]  pause for like a day. We needed a judge's ruling. We sort of argued about it right in the middle of
[16:26.120 --> 16:31.220]  our break shit stream. That was like in the middle of it. And then, was it later that night you
[16:31.220 --> 16:35.760]  continued? Well, there needs to be some additional context. So we finished the podcast,
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.300]  and I think I just have one time to beat, but I don't know which one it is,
[16:40.500 --> 16:45.440]  because I'm downloading the game again. And so I was having a bath playing Property Brothers,
[16:45.620 --> 16:53.140]  as one does. I was like, I need to figure out what time this is. So I just lied to Gavin. I said,
[16:53.200 --> 16:57.580]  hey, I beat your time on this one level, because I knew he had a faster time than me on this one.
[16:57.660 --> 17:00.840]  I couldn't remember what it was called. I was like, I beat it. You do this. He was like, oh,
[17:00.840 --> 17:06.100]  I was thinking of The Betrayal, or something. Is that what the level's called? I'm so bad.
[17:06.440 --> 17:11.340]  The Regret. Thank you. I was thinking of Regret. So I was like, oh shit. Now he revealed to me
[17:11.340 --> 17:16.260]  what the time was that he had. I then spent the next three and a half hours just playing the
[17:16.260 --> 17:21.600]  level over and over again, until I beat him by like four minutes. And then I sent him a message
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.560]  like, balls in your court, because I thought that was the only time I had to defend. And then
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.760]  the next day, Gavin replied. And I will say, it was a very suspicious Gavin thing. At first,
[17:31.820 --> 17:36.680]  it was a message of, I don't know how you got this time. This is impossible. Let's now talk
[17:36.680 --> 17:41.560]  about the rules again, and what the specifics of The Bet actually were. Which then led into
[17:41.560 --> 17:46.160]  our discussion of, well, I thought that you only had like 10 hours left. And Gavin's like, well,
[17:46.200 --> 17:53.080]  I think you only have three hours. We went back and forth. And I just accepted the fact that I'm
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.340]  either A, probably wrong, because there's a history, just me not remembering the specifics
[17:57.340 --> 18:05.600]  of these things. Or B, I remember it correctly, but I just never covered the concept of doing
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.120]  multiple runs at once. And this is not a thing I considered. So although it's within the rules,
[18:10.180 --> 18:13.160]  it's just not what I thought The Bet was. But I didn't, there's no rule against it.
[18:13.300 --> 18:16.680]  I feel like you shot yourself in the foot by lying about beating me in the other one,
[18:16.700 --> 18:19.540]  because that was the one that I had a better time than you in.
[18:20.140 --> 18:23.920]  Well, well, that's why I didn't think it mattered, because I was waiting for you to declare a level.
[18:24.060 --> 18:27.720]  So once you said the other level, honestly, if you had said, damn, I guess I'm gonna have to beat
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.720]  it. In my head, I was like, you f***ing faced yourself, because I couldn't beat that level at
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.560]  that time. I thought it was impossible. And so when you said, oh, I was thinking of this other
[18:37.560 --> 18:42.060]  level. I was like, f*** yeah, it's not that level that you have a great time in. We can just do this
[18:42.060 --> 18:48.740]  one instead. I will say that while Andrew was then working after we resumed the clock,
[18:49.220 --> 18:54.280]  we, Andrew streamed to me on his private stream account, him trying to be outskirts.
[18:54.420 --> 19:00.960]  And it was the most, I wish, I wish it was public, but we obviously couldn't do it that way because
[19:00.960 --> 19:03.800]  we hadn't, the episode where we discussed it hadn't come out yet. It'd be just a bit weird,
[19:04.320 --> 19:10.700]  but it was phenomenally tense. He was getting really good at all the earlier tricks and he
[19:10.700 --> 19:15.400]  would be the, basically the last part is you just drive for like 30 seconds to the end in a water
[19:15.400 --> 19:21.400]  hog. And you can kind of see by that moment, you kind of like trying to guess whether you're going
[19:21.400 --> 19:25.240]  to cross the finish line in the, in the right amount of time. And he'd be like 30 seconds from
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.600]  the end and you would just, all you would see is just time slowly ticking away. And he had to
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.740]  beat like four minutes, 22. And it was like edging up to like 4.15, he was getting close. And I
[19:34.740 --> 19:41.280]  think you got four minutes, 24 before the time you got several times you ended up for 24 and the
[19:41.280 --> 19:45.980]  timer eventually ran out. But I was honestly rooting for you so bad and you were getting
[19:45.980 --> 19:50.060]  really frustrated because actually I wanted to, I wanted it to be a back and forth. It was
[19:50.060 --> 19:54.920]  incredibly entertaining. It was like the best thing I've ever watched on Twitch. It was infuriating
[19:54.920 --> 19:59.100]  because there's so many random variables to that level. Like you can just get sniped and there's
[19:59.100 --> 20:03.460]  nothing you can do about it. There are sequences and there's like no room for error. I have no idea
[20:03.460 --> 20:07.760]  how Gavin did the first part. I just couldn't figure out where to gain two seconds in the
[20:07.760 --> 20:13.740]  beginning. But yeah, streamed. Yeah. New techniques. Okay. I feel like you cheated in some way.
[20:14.440 --> 20:19.720]  I really feel like the game glitched and like didn't track like the clock stop. I don't know
[20:19.720 --> 20:26.280]  what you did, but you have an amazing time on that. And I didn't realize it split time at each
[20:26.280 --> 20:31.840]  checkpoint. So you're like running across the rooftops after 30 seconds and mine is like 10.
[20:32.400 --> 20:39.380]  Yeah. I don't understand what you did. Yeah. There's something in that initial thing because
[20:39.380 --> 20:45.440]  I definitely have the back half faster than you do. It's just like the opening run. You breeze
[20:45.440 --> 20:49.960]  through the hardest part. But I did say that you were in a warthog for that bit and I was in a ghost.
[20:50.140 --> 20:58.760]  So it took me more. So just so I understand, the bet is now over and Andrew lost by two seconds.
[20:58.760 --> 21:04.820]  I lost by two seconds. I think if he even had 20 more minutes, he would have eventually beat me.
[21:06.180 --> 21:11.480]  And I ran until the clock ended. And I also like, I feel like I get some credit for streaming
[21:11.480 --> 21:16.720]  because in theory, if I beat your time, you can just copy literally the exact path I took and try
[21:16.720 --> 21:21.120]  to try to be a little bit more efficient at it. I couldn't shave the two seconds. I submitted maybe
[21:21.120 --> 21:25.620]  five or six runs. Uh, I couldn't do it. It also turned out that when you were giving it all mouth
[21:25.620 --> 21:32.520]  back in the day about how you had all these trap times, I guess. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was the
[21:32.520 --> 21:38.640]  load. Yeah. The load times were so bad before the next gen consoles came out. And, uh, I thought
[21:38.640 --> 21:43.540]  you had to revert to like close the game fully every time you do a run. So it would take me like
[21:43.540 --> 21:49.460]  four minutes every run. And I was so sick. Yeah. Now it's, it's so fast, but I, yeah, I was so
[21:49.460 --> 21:54.800]  sick and I didn't want Gavin to do that level. I just lied about having a time ready to go for it
[21:54.800 --> 21:58.160]  because I just didn't want him to initiate it. You're very good at the mind games because they
[21:58.160 --> 22:03.280]  do work. I, I, for some reason, I do believe you a lot. Yeah. And I should just never take
[22:03.280 --> 22:09.420]  anything you say as true. Well, most of what I say is true. I kind of realized that, uh, Gavin,
[22:09.540 --> 22:14.860]  Gavin, I recently watched, and I know everybody in and associated with our company has been on a
[22:14.860 --> 22:20.860]  binge of it lately, but I recently watched season 20 of Survivor at the recommendation of Andrew.
[22:21.500 --> 22:25.120]  And, uh, I finished it last night and it was like a heroes and villains with like all the,
[22:25.240 --> 22:29.240]  a bunch of winners and some of the best and, and, uh, heroes and some of the shittiest people.
[22:29.600 --> 22:37.100]  And there's this dude named Russell, uh, who, uh, I realized is Andrew. No, he just, he lies,
[22:37.220 --> 22:42.820]  he lies, he manipulates constantly and he, he's charismatic about it. And you can never tell if
[22:42.820 --> 22:47.080]  he's anything coming out of his mouth is, is real. But I think that's not Andrew because Andrew,
[22:47.080 --> 22:53.900]  I think the reason we believe Andrew is because he is mostly telling the truth. It's just the
[22:53.900 --> 22:58.980]  things that count that would be beneficial to him as a lie is when he pulls out lies. And that's
[22:58.980 --> 23:03.420]  why we don't know when he's lying. I don't know, man. I think Russell used the truth as a weapon
[23:03.420 --> 23:08.960]  too sometimes, you know? And it's like, I think Andrew uses the truth. He wields it like a cudgel
[23:08.960 --> 23:14.680]  and he's really smart with it. Calling me Russell Hance is maybe the most insulting thing anyone's
[23:14.680 --> 23:20.480]  ever said to me. Um, no, it's, it's not like they're different. If we are in a competition,
[23:20.980 --> 23:26.100]  then I feel like mind games are totally on the table and that's valid. Outside of that, I'm not,
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.740]  you know, it's a game. Got to play mind games in a game. Russell sucks. Why did, what a harsh,
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.080]  he was my favorite person. What are you talking about? Really? That's interesting. I thought he
[23:37.080 --> 23:43.220]  was fascinating. You should watch season 19 then. Uh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Well you told me to watch
[23:43.220 --> 23:46.280]  season 20, so I watched it. Well, I knew it was on, on Netflix. Well, it's just, you were,
[23:46.500 --> 23:50.260]  you were talking about like when to get into Survivor and I feel like modern Survivor really
[23:50.260 --> 23:54.780]  starts season 19, season 20. Like everything before that doesn't really matter for like the
[23:54.780 --> 24:01.020]  next 20 seasons. So now that you've lost the, uh, the Halo times bet again, what, what is that? Was
[24:01.020 --> 24:06.840]  that a double or nothing on the pencil? I don't, we don't even know what the terms were. Uh, Eric,
[24:07.060 --> 24:11.640]  what are the chances you remember? There's no way. I think it was double or nothing, but I don't
[24:11.640 --> 24:17.300]  remember. Definitely. It was a double or nothing bet. We should find out how much financially I owe
[24:17.300 --> 24:23.400]  you at this point as well. It's either another 500 on top of the one that you are going to put in a
[24:23.400 --> 24:29.740]  safe or it's two pencils. I can't remember. It was two pencils. So this actually brings up something
[24:29.740 --> 24:35.960]  I kind of wanted to talk about today, uh, which is a good segue for this. Uh, there was a lot of
[24:35.960 --> 24:43.800]  like on the fly, like OTF judging going on during this, uh, this 24 hour period. It sounds like, and
[24:44.540 --> 24:49.520]  you guys were kind of scrambling. And then also, uh, on top of that, Andrew and I were talking
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.580]  about some ideas for new face ancillary content, auxiliary content yesterday. And we came up with
[24:55.580 --> 24:59.620]  an idea together for a show that would be a prerecorded show. Probably wouldn't work for the
[24:59.620 --> 25:04.280]  break shit stuff. Uh, but it would require judging. And in my head, I thought, Oh, we'll just
[25:04.280 --> 25:07.820]  have Gavin do the judge. But then that takes you out of the competition. Even though it's a two
[25:07.820 --> 25:11.340]  person competition, I don't want you to never be able to compete. And so it got me thinking,
[25:11.640 --> 25:19.060]  what if we, uh, vote and nominate an official face judge, much like you nominate a judge to
[25:19.060 --> 25:22.700]  the Supreme court, except it's not a lifetime appointment. It's for a period of time, like a
[25:22.700 --> 25:27.640]  year. And we'll say like, what if we like, I would nominate Eric and then we make Eric the official
[25:27.640 --> 25:33.520]  face judge. And then that's Eric's job is to, is to monitor and moderate and keep up with all these
[25:33.520 --> 25:39.400]  bets and all things that need a judging. And then he is, he's the arbiter of, of all of that
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.480]  information. So anytime we need something, he's got it. It seems like it would also be a good job
[25:43.480 --> 25:51.960]  for a super fan. I agree. Do we have any? Uh, no, not currently. To my knowledge, we are currently
[25:51.960 --> 25:56.760]  super fan. We have a lot of fans. There's a lot of comment leavers. We're looking for a new super
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.440]  fan. There is a hole there that needs to be filled currently. Uh, not sure what to do about that,
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.300]  but, uh, you know, just something to think about. No, I liked the idea. I feel like, uh, we could
[26:06.300 --> 26:10.440]  have a variety of judges. I know it doesn't really solve your, your issue or your point of
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.560]  like having somebody know everything just to source back to you. But depending on, uh, what
[26:15.560 --> 26:21.120]  they're, they're picking, we could have a different judge based on what the theme of that episode is.
[26:21.640 --> 26:28.140]  What, like a food based judge and like a video game? Yeah. Like if, if the subject happens to be
[26:28.140 --> 26:32.380]  something that applies to somebody we know, or we feel that they are an expert in that specific
[26:32.380 --> 26:36.840]  subject, it would maybe make sense to switch the judges out just as an idea. I like the idea of a
[26:36.840 --> 26:41.100]  judge though. That's a great idea as well. Yeah. I just like, I don't want to have to keep going
[26:41.100 --> 26:46.040]  outside and paying for it like we did. And that was a whole kerfuffle, you know, uh, with the
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.140]  pencil bet. And it just seems like, like if we could find somebody who we can just identify to
[26:50.140 --> 26:55.000]  be impartial and then they're always, and if it's somebody who's required to come to every recording
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.480]  as well, then it's there, you know? Uh, but I also, I'm not opposed to the idea of different
[27:00.480 --> 27:06.180]  judges for different tasks. I just think that there should be some sort of like a supreme
[27:06.180 --> 27:15.860]  fuck force, fuck force. Fuck force? I don't know if that gets bleeped. Does a flub of the second
[27:15.860 --> 27:19.840]  one get bleeped? No, I don't think so. I think a fuck force stays in. Fuck force is its own word.
[27:19.840 --> 27:27.540]  Uh, some sort of supreme fuck force court, uh, that, uh, you know, is like the official, uh,
[27:27.540 --> 27:34.520]  ruling body of all things fuck face or fluke face industries, uh, as our, as our subsidiary company.
[27:34.660 --> 27:41.000]  Yes. Um, I want to talk about the, uh, so part of the break stuff ended with,
[27:41.100 --> 27:47.440]  maybe the best ending to any stream I've seen, Geoff, your, your child kicker PSA demanding that
[27:47.440 --> 27:54.040]  people relay any information. I've had some real phone number. Yeah. With the real, I bought a
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.620]  number for that shirt and it's just, it's tied to my Skype. And, uh, initially I saw a lot of
[27:59.620 --> 28:03.700]  people saying like when it was live, they couldn't get through. Like the line was busy because
[28:03.700 --> 28:08.580]  everybody was trying to call at the same time. I've had so much fun the last few days, just
[28:08.580 --> 28:14.900]  having Skype open and answering that, that number very seriously. How often does it ring? Uh,
[28:14.900 --> 28:22.280]  it kind of rotates maybe like once every 20 minutes or so I'd say. Yeah, it's great. I'll
[28:22.280 --> 28:26.360]  just be doing a random thing and I'll throw my headphones off, grab my computer headphones
[28:26.980 --> 28:32.760]  very seriously. Have you gotten any, any hot tips, any good solid Intel? A little bit. It's
[28:32.760 --> 28:37.820]  mainly people being terrified, which is the best thing. It makes me laugh. It's so hard not to
[28:37.820 --> 28:42.600]  break. Uh, when people get panicky, uh, cause I'll answer the line, like, hello, you've reached
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.300]  child kicker information line. How may I help you? I'll be very serious about it. And then
[28:47.300 --> 28:52.600]  the very first call I got. You're not pretending to be a police department or you're specifically
[28:52.600 --> 28:58.340]  aligned to that child kicker. Yeah. Yeah. As, as, as we said, it's, I mean, it's what we advertise
[28:58.340 --> 29:06.200]  that. So like the Vancouver police, the call, the very first guy I got sounded like he was high.
[29:06.340 --> 29:09.920]  And so he calls and I'm like, Vancouver child kicker support line. How may I help you?
[29:10.560 --> 29:17.880]  And, uh, there was a pause and silence and he went, Holy shit. It's real. And then he hung up.
[29:18.160 --> 29:26.160]  He got freaked out. It was fantastic. I had another person apologize to me for not having
[29:26.160 --> 29:33.520]  information. That was great. I was like, child kicker support line. Uh, what, what, what, how
[29:33.520 --> 29:38.020]  can I help you? What information do you have? They're like, Oh, I didn't expect this to work.
[29:38.020 --> 29:44.140]  I didn't, uh, I was just watching a live stream and I'm sorry. I'm well, do you have any
[29:44.140 --> 29:48.660]  information about the location of the child kicker at this time? No, I don't know anything. I was just
[29:48.660 --> 29:55.080]  watching. I'm so sorry. Uh, like it was great. People get so nervous. It's fantastic. And I'm
[29:55.080 --> 29:59.120]  also terrified, which makes it even funnier. And my head, I'm like, I have no idea what to say.
[29:59.280 --> 30:02.920]  I don't know how to reply to whatever they will say, but people just panic and hang up typically.
[30:03.080 --> 30:06.200]  So you do answer every time. What if, what if it rings while you're in the bath playing property
[30:06.200 --> 30:10.900]  brothers? Well, I did. It's clearly unavailable at that time. You can leave a voicemail. Uh,
[30:11.680 --> 30:15.620]  should I open it right now and just see, like, I don't think the audio would come through.
[30:15.800 --> 30:20.100]  I just clicked it. Maybe I can ask them if they want to be a judge. Next person who calls.
[30:21.260 --> 30:25.920]  Man, that, uh, that could not have worked out better. That's a really funny.
[30:26.820 --> 30:31.440]  I'm really excited for when the number theoretically gets into the wild. I know
[30:31.440 --> 30:35.520]  we're releasing stickers as well as the shirt and the concept of people not
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.720]  understanding the origin of it calling in. You know what I don't like about phone,
[30:40.860 --> 30:46.320]  like real phone numbers in content is that if you're watching it like 15 years from now,
[30:46.360 --> 30:49.780]  it's clearly going to be something else or a disconnected line. I think you should
[30:49.780 --> 30:56.280]  try and keep this number from now until the end of your life. You want to pay for that, Gavin?
[30:56.960 --> 31:02.740]  If you pay for it, I'll gladly do that. How much is the number? I want to say it's like $60
[31:03.360 --> 31:06.960]  for like, I have to pay for a subscription. $60 a year?
[31:08.120 --> 31:12.360]  Uh, I don't know. Look into it. But yeah. And how many, how many more do you plan on living?
[31:13.160 --> 31:20.780]  Oh, I don't, you know, quite a few. Yeah. At least a minimum. Let's say 55. 55. Yeah. That's
[31:20.780 --> 31:25.900]  like, it's like three, three grand, 3,300 bucks. Here's, uh, here's what I'm thinking, guys.
[31:26.180 --> 31:31.980]  This seems like the perfect thing to, to, to, to wager. What do you mean?
[31:32.740 --> 31:38.840]  I mean, like, this is a double or nothing right here. If you guys, the next bet you guys come up
[31:38.840 --> 31:44.280]  with, if Andrew wins, Gavin has to pay his, uh, his fake phone bill for the rest of his life.
[31:44.940 --> 31:48.980]  I don't have a great... If not, then Andrew continues not to, not to do whatever it is
[31:48.980 --> 31:53.560]  he's required to do. I've never lost more than things related to this show. I don't know if
[31:53.560 --> 31:58.200]  that's a good idea. I'm a, I'm an all time loser here. I feel like you're losing your confidence.
[31:58.200 --> 32:02.340]  You started this podcast as the most confident man and look what's happened.
[32:02.800 --> 32:04.600]  Well, it's just, I've had a bit of a run.
[32:07.800 --> 32:13.280]  It hasn't been, and by run, I mean, fall and hitting every possible branch on the way down.
[32:13.420 --> 32:20.300]  Like it has not been a smooth, smooth path for me as far as the competitions go. I can't do,
[32:20.380 --> 32:25.340]  I literally cannot do another burger bet. I don't have it in me. It's just, I'm, I'm burgered out.
[32:25.340 --> 32:30.660]  The gaming bets... You seem pretty haloed out as well. Oh, you know, I'm back into halo now,
[32:30.760 --> 32:35.100]  but it's just the time thing. I really hope that this is the one bet that I didn't remember
[32:35.100 --> 32:40.300]  correctly. And, and I fucked myself by just agreeing to terms. Do you want to double or
[32:40.300 --> 32:44.300]  nothing the double or nothing? How do, on what? What are we double or nothing? I don't know.
[32:44.380 --> 32:48.700]  You're, you're usually the one with suggestions. Oh, we'll have to think. You know what I found?
[32:48.760 --> 32:54.160]  I, uh, I was going through my old DVDs. Like I still have all my DVDs packed away. I found my
[32:54.160 --> 32:58.900]  old red versus blue box set that I won. Completely forgot about that. I won a competition
[32:58.900 --> 33:05.520]  on the site to get that. And Geoff mailed it to me. Uh, but Geoff forgot, Geoff forgot to send me
[33:05.520 --> 33:10.760]  the prize. And I was too nervous to, it took him like, took me nine months to email Geoff about it
[33:10.760 --> 33:14.400]  and be like, Hey, I don't, I don't think I got it. And then it showed up like a week later.
[33:14.620 --> 33:19.240]  So I sent it. You did send it. Yeah. It just, it took, it took nine months, but the point is
[33:19.240 --> 33:26.360]  I used to win things. That was the thing I won. It was a penny arcade game race to get all the
[33:26.360 --> 33:31.340]  achievements in the penny arcade game. Yeah. The, uh, on the rain slick precipice of darkness.
[33:31.600 --> 33:36.740]  Wow. Here's an idea. Okay. If you guys are looking for something to bet over,
[33:37.220 --> 33:43.980]  I have a lifetime supply of captain. I don't know if you can tell I'm eating right now. I have a
[33:43.980 --> 33:48.460]  lifetime supply of captain crunch in my, in my pantry right now. You guys are welcome to,
[33:48.460 --> 33:54.580]  if I eat it every, if I eat it constantly, like while I'm recording the podcast, if I just never
[33:54.580 --> 34:00.420]  stop, I figure I can, I can get through about half of it this time. Uh, in, uh, I don't know, 2024.
[34:00.820 --> 34:06.220]  So you face the podcast, Andrew, by sending that. Well, okay. So it, that was, that was intended
[34:06.220 --> 34:13.900]  to be a nice thing originally. Um, I sent you what? 12 boxes, 10 boxes of captain crunch.
[34:14.700 --> 34:20.720]  Um, and like, uh, all of the soda ever. Yeah. Four cases of Coke zero. It's been awesome. I'm
[34:20.720 --> 34:24.400]  still, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not kidding, dude. I carry a box of captain crunch around with me
[34:24.400 --> 34:30.840]  24 hours a day. Oh yeah. You were talking about captain crunch box and his giant whipped cream.
[34:30.980 --> 34:37.420]  He's a piece of grass. Yeah. Um, well you sent me those McDonald's muffins months ago. I thought
[34:37.420 --> 34:40.760]  that was really nice. And I just randomly was thinking one day, like, man, I should just,
[34:40.760 --> 34:45.220]  I have Geoff's address because of the porta potty thing. I should just send him something nice
[34:45.220 --> 34:50.480]  on Amazon. It's a way to pay you back. And when I sent you the porta potty toy,
[34:50.820 --> 34:56.840]  they sent me a photo confirming it arrived. And I saw your Amazon order and Coke zero was in,
[34:56.920 --> 35:03.900]  in the grander pile of Amazon stuff. So that was, I went off the assumption that you're a big Coke
[35:03.900 --> 35:08.840]  guy or that the people like Coke in your house. I have been told that you are a Pepsi household.
[35:08.840 --> 35:16.560]  I apologize for sending four cases of Coke zero. Maybe the one time you ordered it. It based my
[35:16.560 --> 35:22.400]  knowledge of like, you love Coke zero. Are you a Pepsi house? I've, I, I am in a, I'm in a Pepsi
[35:22.400 --> 35:29.000]  phase right now where I prefer Pepsi over other sodas, but I still like Coke zero. I'm drinking
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.580]  diet Dr. Pepper right now. That's neither of those things. Well, I just, I felt bad learning
[35:33.580 --> 35:38.900]  Pepsi preference that I send you 48 cans of Coke zero. And then I was just like, I'm going to send
[35:38.900 --> 35:43.940]  you as many Captain Crunch boxes as I could. 10 was the max they would let me send. I'm it's,
[35:44.040 --> 35:50.980]  it was a good max. And, uh, and I, it has maxed out my, uh, my enjoyment of Captain Crunch. And
[35:50.980 --> 35:55.980]  I think that in another week or so we might be in a situation where I never eat it again.
[35:55.980 --> 36:00.520]  As long as I live, we could be entering into corn dog territory here pretty soon.
[36:01.600 --> 36:05.380]  Oh, look, I got a corndog update. You guys want to hear it? Yeah. I'd love to hear your. Yeah.
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.360]  Okay. So the other day I was riding my bike, uh, maybe two days ago and it was like a hot,
[36:09.480 --> 36:14.400]  sunny day. And I rode by a Sandy's, which is where I used to always go and get two corn dogs on a
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.440]  Monday. And it was like a little corn dog ritual. Uh, Oh, it was the whole thing. It was back in
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.760]  the nineties, early two thousands. They only took cat or they, they took, uh, they only took cash
[36:26.380 --> 36:30.160]  and I would go through on my motorcycles back when I had a motorcycle and I would leave work
[36:30.160 --> 36:34.260]  and I'd drive over and I'd get two corn dogs and a soda. And then I would pay with a $20 bill.
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.960]  And the lady would say, do you have anything smaller? And I would go, Nope. Even if I did,
[36:38.280 --> 36:42.340]  because it would piss her off. And then she would get mad. And then this lady and I kind
[36:42.340 --> 36:45.880]  of hated each other, but I really liked those corn dogs and I would always pay with a 20 and
[36:45.880 --> 36:48.880]  then make her break change. And then she hated that because it was like $3 worth of food.
[36:49.220 --> 36:53.960]  And anyway, it was a whole game we played. Uh, and, uh, I rode by that place and I thought,
[36:53.960 --> 37:01.600]  oh shit, am I having a craving for a corn dog? And so I stopped my bike and I, I sat with that
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.080]  feeling for a moment and I realized, no, I wasn't. I still don't want to eat corn dogs anymore.
[37:06.220 --> 37:09.200]  And then I rode my bike away. And that's the latest news on corn dogs. That's the,
[37:09.280 --> 37:12.960]  that's the latest news on corn dogs. I had a thought and then I squashed it.
[37:13.680 --> 37:17.520]  Interesting. I'm still corn dog-less. I am, I'm still, no alcohol, no corn dogs.
[37:19.660 --> 37:24.700]  Maybe, very soon, very soon, maybe no more Captain Crunch with Crunch Berries. We'll have to see.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.740]  How many boxes have you gone through at this point?
[37:27.140 --> 37:31.960]  Uh, well, I was still on my box, my giant box of Texas-

[39:10.260 --> 39:14.800]  We all shop online, and we've all seen that promo code feel
[39:14.800 --> 39:20.640]  taunt us at checkout. But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing
[39:20.640 --> 39:26.320]  of the past. Because Honey is a free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes
[39:26.320 --> 39:31.540]  and applies the best one it finds to your cart. Honey supports over 30,000 stores online,

[39:40.500 --> 39:46.120]  there. I can't personally verify that, but you get the gist. How does it work, you say?
[39:46.560 --> 39:51.240]  I can answer that question for you, because I'm super smart. I'll put it like this. Imagine
[39:51.240 --> 39:55.260]  you're shopping on one of your favorite sites, and when you check out, the Honey button drops down
[39:55.260 --> 40:01.580]  and all you have to do is click apply coupons. So you just wait a few seconds, and Honey searches
[40:01.580 --> 40:09.100]  through the internet, finding those deals, and then if it finds a working coupon, it applies it,
[40:09.100 --> 40:19.000]  and you watch your prices drop, like BOOOOO! Savings. You've heard me talk about how my
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.860]  girlfriend and I used, in a previous ad, we used Honey to get a discount on some paddleboards,
[40:25.060 --> 40:30.420]  and I still use those paddleboards every day. That was an impulse purchase that worked out for me,
[40:30.460 --> 40:36.300]  and I saved money, thanks to Honey. Honey has found it's over 17 million members, over $2
[40:36.300 --> 40:42.680]  billion in savings. You could be a savings billionaire with savings like that. Take that,
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.460]  Jobs and the other one. What's his name? Well, Jobs is dead. Maybe don't do that. So take that,
[40:48.700 --> 40:53.540]  billionaire elite. We're coming for you with savings. If you don't already have Honey,

[42:49.940 --> 42:56.900]  turned. It became seven days of storms, so we cancelled plans. The day we were gonna hang out,
[42:57.580 --> 43:04.040]  completely sunny day, no clouds, about 31 degrees celsius. It was one of the nicest days of the
[43:04.040 --> 43:10.020]  year so far. 31. So now it's, like, reversed screwing with us. I don't know what's happening
[43:10.020 --> 43:15.720]  now. Yeah, I don't know what to do because you're, like, even that morning, the weather reports,
[43:15.720 --> 43:20.320]  I didn't go on a bike ride that morning because the weather report said it's gonna be raining
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.680]  for the next, like, four hours. And then 10 minutes later, and then I had made plans,
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.060]  I assume you made plans that weren't related to being outside, you know, because we weren't
[43:30.060 --> 43:35.000]  gonna hang out. And then the sun comes out and it is the nicest day in the history of
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.980]  the city of Austin. And I was already locked into my other plans. 31 isn't a perfect day. 31
[43:41.980 --> 43:47.480]  is too hot. I know you're in Texas temperature, different scale. I don't want to... what am I
[43:47.480 --> 43:53.020]  doing on a 31? I'm not bike riding. I love the heat. I love the heat. Oh, I'm not a fan. 31
[43:53.020 --> 43:59.880]  to Fahrenheit. 31 celsius to Fahrenheit is 87 degrees. Yeah, it was about right. Yes,
[43:59.880 --> 44:05.700]  I don't like that. I'm a cold... I much prefer cold. You're a cold guy? I am a cold guy, yeah.
[44:06.220 --> 44:10.260]  I definitely prefer it. It's a lot easier to deal with when a thing is too cold. I don't think I
[44:10.260 --> 44:17.720]  own a jacket. I dress like I'm in a warm temperature, but I'm not a cold... Are you the
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.840]  only Canadian without a jacket? I don't know. It gets weird. Like in the summertime, my wardrobe
[44:22.840 --> 44:27.740]  makes perfect sense. I'm always wearing a short sleeve shirt and shorts. In the winter, it becomes
[44:27.740 --> 44:34.920]  odd. So you're wearing shorts in the Canadian winter? Yeah, I mean, west coast winter isn't
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.880]  the same as the eastern Canadian winter. It's not that bad. It's true. I mean, it snows a little bit,
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.560]  but it's like maybe a week of the year. It's not much. It gets cold, but yeah, it's waiting
[44:45.560 --> 44:51.200]  through snow and shorts. How often would you say you're out and about like roaming around the town?
[44:51.620 --> 44:58.220]  Like Andrew Pantin, man about town. Not much in COVID times. Like let's say pre-COVID.
[44:58.300 --> 45:04.580]  Pre-COVID. Well, it's like that's a different thing of like I didn't live like I... I understand.
[45:04.580 --> 45:11.780]  Yeah, it did change. It didn't really make sense to you. What's the latest on watching women piss?
[45:12.020 --> 45:16.340]  Like, is that something you can do? Well, I know it did. I was going to say that never happened.
[45:16.580 --> 45:20.880]  The way it was described never happened. I was horrified. I didn't. It was not a pursuit.
[45:21.220 --> 45:27.060]  I haven't seen it since. No, that does not happen. But not for lack of trying, right? Well, no,
[45:27.080 --> 45:32.000]  I mean, I look out my window sometimes. I don't know. Is that a crime? I'm just trying to see what's
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.060]  happening. Oh, buddy. Nobody's trying to say it's a crime. I look at women peeing. No, I don't.
[45:38.240 --> 45:44.520]  I don't know. I want to move on from this, too, because Piss Boy was a name that died and vanished.
[45:44.880 --> 45:49.260]  Well, I didn't say anything about Piss Boy. You just said Piss Boy again. That's the first
[45:49.260 --> 45:55.580]  utterance of Piss Boy in about 40 episodes. I remember Cram Piss, too. Yeah, that was a great
[45:55.580 --> 46:01.120]  one. Injury content back in the day. The piss really fell off, evaporated. It did. It did.
[46:01.120 --> 46:07.840]  Yeah. The Grill Master. All that's left is a faint odor. Yeah. No, I have not witnessed
[46:07.840 --> 46:14.000]  any women peeing recently. I did. What? Oh, go ahead. I was going to say, what's the most
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.180]  interesting thing you've seen outside of your window recently? Oh, the most fucking The Old
[46:19.180 --> 46:26.180]  Man podcast. What's the most thrilling? I mean, when was the last time you looked out your window?
[46:26.800 --> 46:33.460]  Let me tell you, some birds went by. Man, what a great Tuesday that was. It's like a conversation
[46:33.460 --> 46:40.380]  people in prison would have. How's the weather over there in Canada? What's the most interesting
[46:40.380 --> 46:47.740]  thing you've seen out your window? It's so worse. It's so bad. Not when the previous most interesting
[46:47.740 --> 46:52.660]  thing you'd seen is a homeless woman peeing on a McDonald's. Okay, well, the problem is the place
[46:52.660 --> 46:57.940]  where I lived is very soundproofed and I keep missing all the cool shit. So there was a propane
[46:57.940 --> 47:03.360]  explosion in an alleyway right across from where I live and I didn't hear any of it. I wasn't aware
[47:03.360 --> 47:12.680]  it happened. There's a huge fire and all these propane tanks exploded. I missed it. They destroyed
[47:13.380 --> 47:20.560]  a building recently. I missed all of it. I looked out my window and I was like, oh, I think that
[47:20.560 --> 47:25.180]  building's gonna get destroyed soon. That'll be interesting. And I checked at noon and it was gone.
[47:25.320 --> 47:31.780]  And I was like, how did I miss this? I was here all day. Yeah, so all the cool shit I miss. I just
[47:31.780 --> 47:37.000]  see women pissing. So I stand by my question because everything you just mentioned is
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.320]  ludicrous to see out of a window. Yeah. You know what I've seen outside of my window? I've seen
[47:41.320 --> 47:47.120]  the same old lady walking her dog 18 times a day and she waves at me every time. That's the most
[47:47.120 --> 47:50.940]  interesting thing that I've seen out of my window. Huh. She's got a little hat on. Looks like Gilligan.
[47:51.160 --> 47:57.620]  Like a Gilligan hat. And she's always smiling. Just happily. Yeah. Gav, how about you? Any pissing?
[47:57.720 --> 48:03.240]  Any propane explosions? It sounds like a scene from Left 4 Dead. No, I mean, there's a
[48:03.780 --> 48:09.520]  time of year where I think it's something to do with the height of the sun where birds just keep
[48:09.520 --> 48:15.480]  killing themselves on my window. It's like a two-week period every spring. You'll just hear
[48:16.160 --> 48:21.200]  like... and they're just hammering themselves in the window and there's just like dead birds piling
[48:21.200 --> 48:25.300]  up on the roof. It's like the first four minutes of an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It's just waiting
[48:25.300 --> 48:30.320]  for you to acknowledge it and kick it off. And I think... so I tried putting stickers on the window
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.920]  from the inside, but I don't think they can see it. I think it's just all reflection of the sky
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.640]  from the outside. And it's not a window I can get to from the outside. Like, I don't know how I
[48:40.640 --> 48:45.480]  would even get up to it. So, R.I.P. birds. What type of sticker you put on it? It's like one of those
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.060]  reflective, like, anti-bird stickers. It's a picture of a bird with a circle and a line through it.
[48:52.640 --> 48:56.240]  If you put a child kicker sticker on that window, I guarantee you,
[48:56.680 --> 48:59.300]  no more birdies. It's just a sticker that says, perfected a cheese sandwich.
[49:02.500 --> 49:07.100]  I hate the cheese sandwich only because it should be a grilled cheese. That's really the basis of
[49:07.100 --> 49:12.560]  my hatred. A grilled cheese is a better sandwich. Melt the cheese is superior. It's just delicious.
[49:12.720 --> 49:17.200]  Grilled cheese is such a great sandwich. That's my main issue. It's a fantastic sandwich. It's a
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.500]  different sandwich. I just, yeah, but like, what do I want when I'm miserable? And I just don't
[49:23.500 --> 49:30.740]  like, I don't know when... It's like a tuna sandwich. Fine. Tuna melt. Different. Also fine.
[49:30.760 --> 49:36.000]  I don't like tuna sandwiches. You're not a fish guy? You're not a fish sandwich guy? No.
[49:38.320 --> 49:43.440]  I don't like tuna. I'm okay with some. Yeah. I'm not a big tuna fan. What's your favorite fish?
[49:43.720 --> 49:49.500]  Oh man. It's going to sound so fucking pompous. I like halibut. That's great. I like a halibut.
[49:49.580 --> 49:54.860]  I'm a halibut fan. So what do you have when you get, when you get sushi? I don't know. I'm pretty
[49:54.860 --> 49:59.620]  boring. Like a California roll. I guess it's crab, like imitation crab, generally, I'd assume.
[50:00.100 --> 50:04.680]  What about you? Well, I mean, I'm fine with fish. It's not an interesting answer for me. I just,
[50:04.680 --> 50:07.720]  I just know you're slipping on sushi. No, but at the point we're asking, what's the most
[50:07.720 --> 50:10.800]  interesting thing you've seen out your window lately? I feel like it's fair. I feel like it's
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.600]  on the same level of question. Yeah. I was going to let it go, but Eric asked it. So I'm going to,
[50:15.720 --> 50:22.540]  let's dive in. Why is halibut pompous? Because it's the more expensive fish. When you get fish
[50:22.540 --> 50:27.400]  and chips, you can either get cod or halibut. Halibut's always way more. I feel like it's an
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.340]  elitist fish because of this. I feel like I'm never given the choice when I get fish and chips.
[50:31.340 --> 50:39.060]  Really? I don't think there can be an elitist fish in a fish and chips scenario. I can't,
[50:39.120 --> 50:46.360]  I don't know. Is the halibut the one-sided fish? I don't know what the halibut looks like
[50:46.360 --> 50:51.940]  outside of when it's cooked. I know there's a fish that's like only on one side. What do you
[50:51.940 --> 50:57.880]  mean only on one side? Like all of its shit is on one side. Oh. Like it's got both of its eyes on
[50:57.880 --> 51:03.960]  the same side of its body. Yeah, it's like in Animal Crossing. Here, I'll show you a picture.
[51:04.380 --> 51:11.800]  Are you thinking like a sunfish? I don't know. No, you catch them in here. You catch all sorts
[51:11.800 --> 51:22.260]  of fucking fish, Geoff. What are you doing? What are you doing, Geoff? I can't see its eyes. It's
[51:22.260 --> 51:26.880]  the worst picture ever. Well, what is it called? That's a halibut. That's a halibut? That's what
[51:26.880 --> 51:31.080]  halibut looks like? Oh, shit. Here, there you can see his eyes. Yeah, look at his eyes. Look at
[51:31.080 --> 51:36.320]  his eyes. I, uh, pompous isn't the word I think of when I look at that fish in those eyes.
[51:38.080 --> 51:41.760]  I think you're doing that fish a favor by eating it. What's on the other side of a halibut,
[51:41.880 --> 51:46.480]  and does it taste different? I don't know how to answer that.
[51:49.160 --> 51:52.840]  Yeah, you only see it from the right. It's like the moon.
[51:55.660 --> 52:00.420]  The dark side of the halibut. Does a halibut have 80 eyes?
[52:01.100 --> 52:07.620]  No, that's just, it's a weird angle, right? Like the head is placed awkwardly on the rest
[52:07.620 --> 52:10.280]  of the body, like the head is sideways? I don't know, dude. Look at this. Which one are you,
[52:10.400 --> 52:15.560]  how does a fish turn its head? Well, no, look at, look at that one. I don't know. That's what
[52:15.560 --> 52:19.700]  I'm saying. I think it only has two eyes, but it's like its eyes are placed weirdly. Like,
[52:19.700 --> 52:23.800]  it's an unfortunate... So what's on the other side? Just nothingness. Yeah, I think it just
[52:23.800 --> 52:28.700]  sits on the floor. It just like sits there. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I see. So what's a
[52:28.700 --> 52:34.520]  halibut, halibut, halibut back? What a fucking mistake that is. Halibut back. Can we see the
[52:34.520 --> 52:40.160]  back of a halibut? Oh, yeah. It's just a fish with nothing on it. Yeah. It's just a weird plane.
[52:40.660 --> 52:48.020]  Here we go. The dark side of the halibut. Uh, yeah. That just looks like a fish without a face.
[52:49.700 --> 52:54.840]  It's all fish belly white. That's really big. It's a big guy. Oh, dude,
[52:54.960 --> 52:58.860]  you want to see something crazy? Do you think 3D works for halibut? Here's a picture of the
[52:58.860 --> 53:04.020]  halibut. What do you mean? This guy likes halibut so much he's got a full body tattoo of it. Wow.
[53:04.100 --> 53:07.840]  Oh, my God. Yes, I think 3D works just fine on halibut.
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.800]  What a weird evolutionary thing that's happened to that fish. Is halibut... It's just like,
[53:16.800 --> 53:20.640]  man, I'm wasting my eye. It's just looking at sand all the time.
[53:23.660 --> 53:29.220]  Oh, halibut's expensive. It says, why does halibut cost so much? It is. It's an expensive fish. It's
[53:29.220 --> 53:33.780]  a snobby fish, I feel like. Well, that must be... Let me try halibut and chips. That makes sense
[53:33.780 --> 53:37.720]  because it looks... You've never had halibut and chips? It's probably royal. I think I've
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.440]  just had cod and chips. It's every... I don't... I've never been to a fish and chip place that
[53:42.440 --> 53:47.280]  doesn't give you the option to upgrade to halibut. Really? Oh, maybe I've been missing out.
[53:47.840 --> 53:52.020]  You've never upgraded. What a shame. What would be the most expensive fish to have,
[53:52.140 --> 53:58.660]  like, battered with chips? Oh, I have no idea. Like, like sushi grade albacore or something?
[53:58.880 --> 54:03.840]  Yeah, probably albacore. What is the most expensive fish?
[54:05.660 --> 54:10.540]  Oops. What was that? What do you mean, oops? Oh, I don't know what I was typing.
[54:10.540 --> 54:12.120]  Did you just order the most expensive fish?
[54:14.660 --> 54:19.320]  A fish. It is... You know that you can order singular items off of Amazon, Gavin?
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.860]  What do you mean, like a screw? No, like grocery items. Like,
[54:23.880 --> 54:26.840]  I could just send Geoff a potato if I wanted. It's like 50 cents.
[54:28.620 --> 54:32.160]  I feel like people would get mad at me, but I really kind of wanted to send Geoff a potato
[54:32.160 --> 54:37.100]  every day. This is 50 cents. I love potatoes, man. Yeah, no, potatoes are great.
[54:37.100 --> 54:41.040]  I think it'd be great to subscribe to potatoes on GeoffBot.
[54:45.260 --> 54:49.160]  I feel like the real prank would be when it ended. Like, if I gave you... I have a 30-day
[54:49.160 --> 54:54.480]  free trial for Amazon Fresh. When the potato ended, you'd be so used to just getting a free
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.780]  potato every day. Yeah, he's just counting on his spuds, and then they stop coming. He's like,
[54:58.840 --> 55:02.680]  what the hell? Every day by about two o'clock, it's tater time. Ready to go.
[55:02.980 --> 55:06.420]  The most expensive fish in the world, and I don't think you're supposed to eat it. I think
[55:06.420 --> 55:11.260]  you're supposed to put it in an aquarium and look at it. Would you like to guess how much
[55:11.260 --> 55:19.240]  an exquisite platinum arowana costs? To own? I would guess $25,000.
[55:20.000 --> 55:27.160]  $50,000. That fish costs $400,000. Frickin' hell. Yeah, well, wait. So that...
[55:27.160 --> 55:29.620]  It's a nice-looking fish. That better be some good-ass meat.
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.660]  Is it like a 1 of 75? What's the rarity of the fish?
[55:33.660 --> 55:37.260]  It's a parallel. It's a first off the line, so yeah.
[55:41.400 --> 55:44.800]  Japanese tuna, bluefin tuna, is the most expensive fish to eat, they say.
[55:45.440 --> 55:49.480]  Okay, and that one is just to preserve, to own? You want to just look at it?
[55:49.500 --> 55:51.740]  I mean, if you ate it, that'd be a hell of a meal.
[55:53.300 --> 55:58.520]  Is it facing extinction? Like, what makes it so rare? Is it just the fact that there's so few?
[55:58.880 --> 56:01.180]  I closed that link already. I'm not... Great.
[56:01.680 --> 56:05.100]  Do the work to get back there. I know it doesn't make any sense,
[56:05.220 --> 56:08.960]  but it feels weird to me that that fish would not make any of the profit on that sale.
[56:09.220 --> 56:11.480]  It makes me sort of uncomfortable in a weird way.
[56:11.600 --> 56:14.800]  He's not getting, like, expensive fish to go along with it?
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.620]  Yeah, there should be something. There should be, like, a fish contract that he gets compensated
[56:18.620 --> 56:20.680]  for the sale. It's like a fish bank account.
[56:21.080 --> 56:24.500]  Yeah. I don't know what that is. I don't know if it's, like, a larger tank.
[56:24.920 --> 56:28.460]  If it's, like, a guaranteed level. What percentage would you give the fish?
[56:28.460 --> 56:31.960]  Oh, 40% easily. Without a doubt, the fish...
[56:31.960 --> 56:33.900]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's the fish. What do you mean?
[56:34.340 --> 56:36.900]  No fish, there's nothing. You're selling nothing.
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.200]  Purses not selling themselves. And they caught the fish, I guess.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.580]  I mean, that's something worth mentioning. I mean, hey, I'm giving him 60 for the catch.
[56:47.080 --> 56:48.800]  But 40% should go to that fish.
[56:49.680 --> 56:50.840]  All right. I agree with that.
[56:51.020 --> 56:52.440]  What is the fish going to do with the money?
[56:53.140 --> 56:56.840]  I don't know. That's for the fish to decide, Geoff. I don't think we get to make those decisions.
[56:56.840 --> 56:59.760]  It's just weird. I don't know. The concept of selling a living
[56:59.760 --> 57:02.760]  thing to somebody, like, I don't know. It's just odd.
[57:02.920 --> 57:04.220]  Okay. You never owned a dog?
[57:05.220 --> 57:05.380]  Yeah.
[57:05.460 --> 57:10.340]  No, I understand that. But when it's, like, life-changing money, it becomes weird to me.
[57:11.900 --> 57:16.120]  Especially for something you just look at. Like, I don't know. You'd take care of...
[57:16.120 --> 57:21.280]  I feel like it's really bad in a fire to have an expensive fish. Because what are you going to do?
[57:21.340 --> 57:22.700]  Grab the fish and hold it?
[57:22.720 --> 57:25.780]  I would argue the fish is the most prepared when a fire happens.
[57:26.280 --> 57:28.380]  You're just going to come back to a boiled fish.
[57:28.420 --> 57:31.900]  Yeah, I would argue that fish is going to boil very, very quickly.
[57:31.900 --> 57:34.220]  You're just thinking that because it's wet, it's cold?
[57:34.460 --> 57:35.360]  No, it's fine.
[57:35.560 --> 57:36.120]  It's going to cook alive.
[57:37.480 --> 57:41.520]  You just... you pour ice cubes into the tank and then you... yeah.
[57:41.620 --> 57:41.940]  Yeah.
[57:42.500 --> 57:45.920]  I would owl under the door, then you jump out the window and wish it luck.
[57:46.200 --> 57:49.100]  Yep. Just pour a bunch of ice cubes in the tank. It'll be all good.
[57:49.400 --> 57:49.960]  You know...
[57:49.960 --> 57:51.180]  It'll freeze to death.
[57:51.580 --> 57:55.200]  No, the heat will warm it up. It'll balance the temperatures equally. It'll be fine.
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.520]  The fish is the animal I'd be least scared of having in a fire scenario.
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.900]  An arowana? That's a fussy fish, I bet.
[58:05.260 --> 58:10.320]  Yeah, that fish is going to... that fish... and that fish is worth a significant amount of money.
[58:10.660 --> 58:13.980]  It can spend that 40% of money to fuck you over at some point, too.
[58:14.680 --> 58:18.080]  I just want to know why it's so expensive. I mean, it's a very pretty fish.
[58:18.920 --> 58:21.580]  I wonder if they're like... is it that specific version of it?
[58:21.600 --> 58:23.140]  Goddammit, I'll google it. Why is an arowana...
[58:23.140 --> 58:23.780]  It's got to be rare.
[58:24.500 --> 58:27.600]  It has to be rare. But like, I wonder if there's a shitty version.
[58:27.780 --> 58:32.400]  Like, I'm applying trading card value to this. Or like, that's a gem mint.
[58:32.500 --> 58:33.340]  That's a 10 out of 10.
[58:33.460 --> 58:38.620]  It's a logo, man. Let's see. The main reason why the arowana is so expensive
[58:38.620 --> 58:43.840]  is because the fish is on the endangered species list and in high demand in Asian cultures.
[58:43.840 --> 58:45.460]  Why are people selling them at all, then?
[58:45.520 --> 58:48.220]  The arowana is believed to bring good luck and prosperity.
[58:48.740 --> 58:51.480]  Arowana is also difficult to breed in captivity.
[58:52.120 --> 58:53.860]  Do not keep near fire.
[58:55.320 --> 58:58.240]  Yeah, I would take that fish tank bathed in ice.
[58:58.440 --> 59:00.660]  Yeah, I would not do that with that fish.
[59:00.860 --> 59:01.840]  You ever have pet fish?
[59:02.080 --> 59:03.140]  Yeah, in high school I did.
[59:03.540 --> 59:04.640]  What type of fish did you have?
[59:04.980 --> 59:07.540]  I had a jack dempsey, is what it was called.
[59:07.780 --> 59:08.860]  What is a jack dempsey?
[59:08.920 --> 59:12.000]  Yeah, jack dempsey. And it was like an aggressive fighting fish.
[59:12.120 --> 59:14.400]  My dad had them when he was a kid, and so I had one.
[59:14.920 --> 59:16.660]  And it was cool. It would eat out of my hand.
[59:16.760 --> 59:19.700]  It would like... I would feed it... I could feed it fish food out of my...
[59:19.700 --> 59:20.980]  like fish pellets out of my hand.
[59:20.980 --> 59:22.780]  And it wouldn't do that for anybody else, just for me.
[59:24.200 --> 59:27.200]  And I never set it on fire or anything.
[59:27.940 --> 59:28.520]  No, nice.
[59:28.680 --> 59:29.340]  It lived until it died.
[59:29.700 --> 59:30.180]  That's great.
[59:30.620 --> 59:35.160]  Had a family member who owned two rather large angelfish.
[59:35.700 --> 59:38.900]  Like make a circle with your, you know, finger and thumb or whatever.
[59:39.460 --> 59:40.040]  It's pretty big.
[59:40.300 --> 59:43.980]  Big enough to be like, oh, I gotta look after this as an individual, not just a bunch of fish.
[59:44.520 --> 59:49.680]  And they were cleaning the tank once and pulled out like the plastic castle and stuff.
[59:50.140 --> 59:51.440]  Clean it all off, put it back in.
[59:51.740 --> 59:54.700]  And then like a day later, it was like, where's the other fish?
[59:54.760 --> 59:55.440]  There's only one.
[59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.140]  And he realized that he'd put the castle down on top of it.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.460]  And it was flat against the bottom.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.100]  He's like, oh my God, he pulled it up.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.920]  The fish just got up and started swimming again.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.220]  But it spent a day just on its side under a castle.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.520]  And I can't believe it lived.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.480]  It lived for years.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.500]  That's the true trap story.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.780]  Who needs 127 hours?
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.100]  A castle and a tank.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.600]  The inspiring movie.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.520]  That fish must have had some severe psychological damage.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.460]  I don't know.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.620]  I don't know what a fish can experience.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.740]  But I could not believe it lived for so long after that.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.500]  It was unbelievable.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.160]  Yeah, but what kind of life was it?
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.820]  I just was really scared of the castle after that.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.820]  Oh my God, that fish must have had a complete and total breakdown every time you guys started
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:45.500]  to clean the tank.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.220]  That poor fish.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.000]  I can't.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.800]  Do you know how you kill a fish?
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.240]  I mean, there are several ways.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.780]  Do you know how you're supposed to like euthanize a pet fish?
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:58.440]  No.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.140]  Apparently, you get clove oil and you just put it in.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.180]  You just put some clove oil in the water that it's in and then it dies.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:05.960]  It's tragic.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:06.600]  Peacefully.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:12.180]  I don't know why it kills them, but it's like apparently a really nice way to kill a fish.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.320]  You said that like you're Agent 47.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.400]  There is a calmness in your voice of like the efficiency of,
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.340]  you know how to take out a fish without anybody suspecting anything.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.000]  I just ended up in a weird side of YouTube once and just watch someone clove oil their
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.400]  fish because it had a tuber and it was really sad.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.200]  It was awful.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.060]  That is super sad.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.320]  Yeah, that's a YouTube hole you do not want to go deeper into.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.260]  Yeah, it is nothing but sadness.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.660]  You live in a dark, sad YouTube world, Gavin.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.420]  Why is that?
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:40.920]  I don't know.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.580]  I don't know how I got that.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.500]  I think in my head, I'd love to own fish.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.680]  I'd love to have a nice aquarium.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.280]  But back in, you know, before the pandemic, I would just I feel like I just travel too
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.680]  much to properly look after a pet that doesn't feed itself.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.400]  It's a lot of effort to take care of an aquarium.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.720]  I had when I was in high school, I had three and it was like it was like a full time job.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.680]  I also looked into getting jellyfish because apparently you can get like nice circular
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.680]  tanks and they just swim endlessly and they don't because it's circular that it gets that
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.100]  gets stuck in the corners and die.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:15.220]  But then I read that you have to like squirt food up them like manually, individually.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.200]  It's like you have to like pipette food up the middle of a jellyfish.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.240]  And if you got like 15 jellyfish, it's like a that's like an ordeal every day.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.300]  So I just didn't do it.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.620]  It's a lot of work.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.340]  What about you, Andrew?
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.440]  You had aquariums?
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.300]  I had to.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.120]  Yeah, I clearly wanted like a dog as a kid.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.340]  And I got goldfish.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:38.500]  I named it Fluffy and Snowflake, which are great names for fish.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:43.200]  Yeah, Fluffy ate Snowflake.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.920]  Yeah, it was not a great.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.460]  It was not a great relationship.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.940]  Then I hated Fluffy.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.600]  I had a funeral for Snowflake.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.500]  I was so sad.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.360]  Like we glued popsicle sticks together and family came over.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.300]  We had like a whole funeral to bury my fish.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.000]  It was like the first pet I lost.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:02:59.740]  Devastating.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.300]  Do you want to know the grossest fucking thing that I just remembered about my fish?
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.300]  It was so fucking good.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:05.640]  Please.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.000]  Okay.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.500]  So this Jack Dempsey, this incredibly aggressive...
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.100]  What's that other fish everybody always had?
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.600]  Clownfish.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.260]  No... Oscar, right?
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.360]  The Oscar.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.220]  It's like the natural enemy to the Oscar.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.160]  Anyway, okay.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.180]  So I would, as a treat, I would buy him...
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.400]  Because he's a big-ass fish, right?
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.060]  He was like, you know, seven, eight inches long, maybe.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.160]  He was in like a 55-gallon aquarium.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.500]  And I would feed him other fish.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.340]  I'd get him like goldfish or tetras or something.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.960]  Get like 30 for a dollar and then just throw them in the tank.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.600]  And what he would do is I would go to bed.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.140]  I would just throw them in there and they'd be fine.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.440]  And I remember thinking, sometimes I'm thinking like,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.460]  Oh, maybe I can actually have some other fish and he won't kill them because he just kills them all.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.780]  And then I would get up in the morning and I'd go check on them.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.980]  And there would be 30 or 40 goldfish swimming around without eyeballs.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.120]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.060]  He would eat their eyeballs out.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.920]  And they would swim around blind until he decided to use them as food.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.280]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.720]  It was one of the most disturbing.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.520]  And I stopped doing it because I was just like, I can't.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.520]  It's like carnage.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.300]  I can't take it.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.440]  I can't watch a bunch of...
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.660]  Because there's like eye guts coming out of them.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.140]  And they're just like swimming around like life is pain.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.940]  And I just like, ugh.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:20.700]  So I stopped doing it.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.340]  This podcast took such a turn toward the end.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:28.740]  Can we go back to talking about your whipped cream fire extinguisher?
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.500]  That was fun.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.700]  That was a good time.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.300]  The blood fire extinguisher was better than this.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.620]  No, it was.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.100]  Yeah.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.380]  You have never...
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.840]  You don't know what it's like to see like 40...
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840]  No, I don't want to know what it's like.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.640]  No, I don't want to be here, Geoff.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:49.720]  Eye sockets with just like shit, just like strings of whatever coming out.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.860]  And they're just like swimming around like zombies in a daze.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.400]  Like they don't know what they're doing.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.760]  So I found my old Xbox games and I was looking through my media.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.740]  None of the discs are in the box.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.960]  I hated young me.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.800]  If you have physical media, please put them in the case.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.120]  You will regret it later.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.880]  I now have a box of games I used to own, essentially.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.300]  It's just like proof that I bought them, but I cannot play them.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.600]  It's very upsetting.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.840]  What game were you looking for?
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.940]  I was really hoping I'd find 50 Cent Blood on the Sand,
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.780]  but I was mainly just like going through all of my...
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:24.200]  Since we moved, I still have a lot of my DVDs and stuff in boxes that I just haven't sorted.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.680]  So I was going through everything.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.140]  And I had a big box of Xbox games and none of them have discs in them.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.640]  I did find my original Left 4 Dead.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.160]  If you want to get that achievement, Geoff, remember that achievement we tried to get?
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:34.820]  That was horrible.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.260]  You want to try it again?
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.260]  I'm ready.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.200]  What achievement?
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.320]  Are you missing an achievement?
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.120]  I'm missing one achievement in the original Left 4 Dead.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.840]  And it was what Geoff and I played the day before we started 50 Cent Blood on the Sand.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.520]  And it was terrible.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.280]  We both sucked.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.120]  We agreed never to talk about this.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.940]  I just did a Left 4 Dead Let's Play with Achievement Hunter last week.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.460]  That game is still awesome.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.120]  It's great.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.600]  I'd love to play Left 4 Dead with you guys.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.240]  They're making that Back 4 Blood game.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.980]  I think that comes out in October now.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.860]  It's the same people that made Left 4 Dead.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.000]  I'm really hoping that it comes back.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.500]  It's crazy.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.720]  I'm missing so many Left 4 Dead achievements.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.380]  What happened?
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.240]  There are tough ones.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.980]  I got 46 of 65.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:16.820]  Oh, that's embarrassing.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.160]  For the original game or Left 4 Dead 2?
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.140]  Original.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.600]  It's probably DLC.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.380]  We got to go back and do it.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.040]  I'd love to.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.220]  It sounds like a Left 4 Dead crew.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.260]  Let's do a Left 4 Dead thing.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.600]  Eric does a Left 4 Dead.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.200]  We need a fourth.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.540]  No, but I can get it.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.940]  All right, there we go.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.480]  Eric's in.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:34.380]  Sure.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:34.960]  Perfect.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.540]  We should stream it.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.140]  Yeah.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:37.800]  No, for sure.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.280]  I think we should.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.020]  I think it's a great idea.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.360]  Okay, great.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.000]  Well, there you go.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.360]  Tune into our new show, F*** Faced Plays Left 4 Dead.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.520]  And it streams it.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.500]  Are we doing a bet, Gavin?
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.680]  What are we betting on?
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.040]  Did we ever come to terms on that?
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.400]  I don't know, Andrew.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.660]  Do you want more time to think about it?
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.120]  Yeah, we could think about it.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:02.860]  It's a good idea.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.180]  Kick around.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.740]  While you guys are thinking about that, kick around the idea of nominating an official judge
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.860]  or finding a maybe even a quorum of judges.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:12.960]  I have Skype open.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.580]  Nobody's called.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.680]  No, I like the idea a lot.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:16.640]  Just nobody's called.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:17.960]  Can't nominate anybody.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:18.940]  It's unfortunate.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:19.620]  All right.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.200]  Well, I seem to be done talking to you guys at this point.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.040]  Yeah, are you good?
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.720]  You don't have anything else on your list to emotionally scar us?
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.500]  Or you want to save some for next week?
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.200]  Yeah, how do I erase that from my head?
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.400]  I mean, if you figured out, let me know because I've been living with it for about 30 years.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.060]  And I'm not f***ing into it.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:44.740]  I also, somebody asked me, a comment leaver I saw, a few of them asked me for a sock update.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.160]  And since I gave a corndog update, I'll give a sock update too.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.760]  The update is, I don't give a s*** about my socks anymore.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.180]  I'm wearing the wrong socks right now.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:51.560]  I don't care.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.560]  I got it right once and that's, that fixed everything.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.280]  And now I just, I am able to ignore it.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.520]  So I'm continuing to ignore it.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.600]  That's the same as the last update.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.360]  That's my update.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.260]  Somebody asked for an update, that's what it is.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.540]  The update is it continues to be the same.
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.460]  The update is there are no updates.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:06.960]  Yeah.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:07.180]  Okay.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.120]  The update is there are no updates.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.220]  That's a redundant update.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.100]  All right.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:10.560]  It's not new.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.560]  Next week, it's a fire extinguisher.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.580]  Very excited.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.140]  One year.
