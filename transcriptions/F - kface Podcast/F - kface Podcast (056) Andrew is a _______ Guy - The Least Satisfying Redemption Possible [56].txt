[01:04.830 --> 01:09.390]  I want to know what your natural in this moment hello is.
[01:09.590 --> 01:11.130]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:11.990 --> 01:12.610]  Pretty upbeat.
[01:12.890 --> 01:14.150]  That's what you always sound like.
[01:14.270 --> 01:15.030]  Yeah, I'm always upbeat.
[01:15.170 --> 01:16.050]  I don't know what you want from me.
[01:16.090 --> 01:17.510]  Do you want me to be less enthusiastic?
[01:17.770 --> 01:19.290]  Generally speaking, I can bring it down lower.
[01:19.750 --> 01:21.650]  But all right, let me ask you this then.
[01:21.870 --> 01:22.110]  Okay.
[01:22.190 --> 01:23.470]  What's my normal hello?
[01:24.770 --> 01:27.470]  Uh, well, that's an interesting thing.
[01:27.750 --> 01:28.550]  That is an interesting...
[01:28.550 --> 01:32.330]  I feel like it recently it's been high fuck everything.
[01:33.050 --> 01:39.530]  So what you're saying is the hello I gave is commiserate with my average hello?
[01:39.670 --> 01:41.370]  No, the hello you gave...
[01:41.370 --> 01:42.710]  Hardly warrants pointing out.
[01:42.830 --> 01:43.610]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:43.710 --> 01:48.570]  The hello you've given recently has been my life is in shambles hello.
[01:49.050 --> 01:50.910]  This was I'm irritated hello.
[01:51.470 --> 01:51.810]  Okay.
[01:51.830 --> 01:55.110]  This was actively I have life and I'm mad about it.
[01:55.130 --> 02:01.670]  Would you consider an agitated hello to be a higher or me to be in a better place
[02:01.670 --> 02:02.510]  than a hello?
[02:02.550 --> 02:03.330]  I want to kill myself.
[02:03.370 --> 02:03.570]  Hello.
[02:03.910 --> 02:05.930]  I don't know how to measure those lows.
[02:06.110 --> 02:11.210]  I just and honestly, like this could be on me because we had I mean, you're one of the
[02:11.210 --> 02:13.730]  most confusing text conversations I've ever been a part of.
[02:14.110 --> 02:17.830]  I'd like to know why why that had to happen.
[02:18.310 --> 02:19.630]  I would love to too.
[02:19.870 --> 02:20.470]  That'd be great.
[02:20.730 --> 02:21.650]  I don't know why that happened.
[02:22.050 --> 02:23.190]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:23.510 --> 02:27.090]  I just asked a question about a video game and I answered it.
[02:27.170 --> 02:28.770]  That's wasn't the confusing part.
[02:28.870 --> 02:29.870]  I understood all that.
[02:29.870 --> 02:32.210]  So what was the confusing part?
[02:32.730 --> 02:34.430]  I'm trying to where's my phone?
[02:34.850 --> 02:37.250]  Because I got blamed by you.
[02:37.510 --> 02:39.090]  Yeah, because you have wrote it.
[02:39.210 --> 02:39.390]  Where?
[02:39.570 --> 02:44.810]  One of the most bad feelings you one of the most baffling texts I've ever gotten.
[02:44.970 --> 02:46.630]  I don't know if we've talked about on the show.
[02:46.910 --> 02:48.770]  You just lied for no reason.
[02:49.050 --> 02:49.550]  What?
[02:49.670 --> 02:50.570]  There's no payoff.
[02:50.870 --> 02:52.750]  We were talking about a thing.
[02:53.010 --> 02:57.070]  Now here's Gavin talking about a thing we were talking about.
[02:57.110 --> 02:58.730]  We're just we're having a conversation.
[02:58.730 --> 03:00.570]  Just like a you and I conversation.
[03:00.870 --> 03:01.930]  There's no bits or anything.
[03:02.050 --> 03:02.790]  We're just talking.
[03:03.510 --> 03:04.290]  And you said.
[03:04.830 --> 03:05.650]  Is Gavin here?
[03:05.690 --> 03:08.470]  I want him to hear the absurdity that was this conversation.
[03:08.850 --> 03:10.030]  Are you talking about the text conversation?
[03:10.170 --> 03:10.530]  No, no, no.
[03:10.590 --> 03:14.510]  I'm talking about a previous one, which is why I blame Geoff for the weirdness of this one.
[03:14.850 --> 03:16.070]  This one was Gavin's fault.
[03:16.330 --> 03:16.950]  God damn it.
[03:17.170 --> 03:17.410]  I don't.
[03:17.830 --> 03:17.950]  What do you mean?
[03:18.210 --> 03:18.910]  I asked a...
[03:20.790 --> 03:21.890]  What happened, Gavin?
[03:22.250 --> 03:24.670]  In the past, I was talking to Geoff.
[03:24.770 --> 03:25.570]  We're going back and forth.
[03:25.630 --> 03:26.470]  Great conversation.
[03:26.690 --> 03:28.010]  Hold on one second, Andrew.
[03:28.170 --> 03:28.570]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:29.050 --> 03:32.450]  Hello and welcome to F*** Face, episode 55, I believe.
[03:32.910 --> 03:34.630]  Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, go.
[03:34.910 --> 03:35.090]  Hello.
[03:35.410 --> 03:36.010]  Wow, great.
[03:37.010 --> 03:37.990]  Wow, you did the intro.
[03:38.050 --> 03:39.370]  I had a whole thing prepared.
[03:39.630 --> 03:40.450]  You didn't have to do that.
[03:40.850 --> 03:41.230]  Anyway.
[03:41.970 --> 03:42.730]  Jesus Christ.
[03:43.190 --> 03:44.210]  I was trying to be nice to you.
[03:44.270 --> 03:46.390]  You're fucking complaining about the hosting triangle.
[03:46.570 --> 03:47.390]  I'm trying to help out.
[03:47.490 --> 03:49.310]  I'm trying to do more of my role, according to you.
[03:49.310 --> 03:51.890]  If you help out by continuing your goddamn story.
[03:52.050 --> 03:53.390]  Okay, I'm talking about it.
[03:53.430 --> 03:54.110]  Jesus Christ.
[03:54.130 --> 03:56.870]  I said, God damn it.
[03:57.390 --> 03:57.990]  I said.
[03:57.990 --> 03:59.490]  Because Geoff came in with attitude.
[03:59.990 --> 04:01.010]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[04:01.070 --> 04:02.450]  No, I came in and I said hello.
[04:02.630 --> 04:04.290]  And Andrew picked apart my hello.
[04:04.610 --> 04:06.070]  He attacked me from hello.
[04:06.570 --> 04:10.810]  And then he attacked me by saying I sounded like I was in a better mood than previously.
[04:10.910 --> 04:12.590]  And I somehow got attacked for it.
[04:12.790 --> 04:14.350]  And I'd like to point out.
[04:14.630 --> 04:19.750]  I'd like to point out that I said I was looking forward to not yelling at all this episode.
[04:19.870 --> 04:21.630]  And it took Andrew one minute.
[04:22.130 --> 04:24.570]  But you're in control about whether you yell or not.
[04:25.210 --> 04:26.010]  Am I?
[04:27.010 --> 04:27.630]  All right.
[04:28.130 --> 04:29.650]  Please just tell your story.
[04:29.790 --> 04:30.650]  Okay, I'm telling my story.
[04:30.750 --> 04:32.250]  So we're texting back and forth, Gavin.
[04:32.630 --> 04:33.650]  And Geoff texts me.
[04:34.110 --> 04:36.850]  Did I ever tell you about the time I met Jon Favreau?
[04:37.190 --> 04:38.750]  And I said, no, I don't think you have.
[04:38.890 --> 04:41.530]  If it's like a great story, maybe save it for the podcast.
[04:41.830 --> 04:42.450]  Was this today?
[04:42.790 --> 04:43.850]  No, this is in the past.
[04:44.030 --> 04:44.250]  Okay.
[04:44.430 --> 04:45.570]  How long ago are we talking?
[04:45.810 --> 04:47.250]  Maybe like three weeks ago, four weeks.
[04:47.690 --> 04:49.170]  It's like relatively recent.
[04:49.750 --> 04:50.410]  Geoff said this.
[04:50.430 --> 04:53.270]  And I'm like, no, I don't think I've heard your Favreau story.
[04:53.270 --> 04:53.850]  Hold on.
[04:53.890 --> 04:56.210]  Before you continue, what led up to this?
[04:56.210 --> 04:58.030]  You want me to fucking tell this story?
[04:58.210 --> 05:00.110]  You keep yelling at me about telling the story.
[05:00.270 --> 05:01.810]  We're like three minutes in.
[05:02.010 --> 05:03.030]  Jesus Christ.
[05:03.390 --> 05:04.310]  What is your question?
[05:04.750 --> 05:06.110]  What led up to this moment?
[05:06.410 --> 05:06.890]  I don't know.
[05:06.910 --> 05:08.550]  We were talking extensively.
[05:08.850 --> 05:09.950]  We had a long talk.
[05:10.490 --> 05:12.590]  Did Jon Favreau come up in the conversation?
[05:12.830 --> 05:15.610]  Jon Favreau did not tell me about somebody famous you met?
[05:15.650 --> 05:15.970]  Yes.
[05:16.190 --> 05:17.710]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:17.750 --> 05:18.950]  This is what I think happened.
[05:19.070 --> 05:21.390]  We're talking about Christmas movies.
[05:21.390 --> 05:25.230]  And we're talking about For Christmas that Jon Favreau was in.
[05:25.570 --> 05:27.350]  I said, Jon Favreau was great in that movie.
[05:27.830 --> 05:32.510]  And then you said here, you're just generally a Favreau fan, which I also agree is great.
[05:32.590 --> 05:33.050]  You can be great.
[05:33.130 --> 05:33.390]  Love him.
[05:33.470 --> 05:37.370]  And then you randomly said out of nowhere, did I tell you my Favreau story?
[05:37.410 --> 05:39.370]  I said, no, I haven't heard your Favreau story.
[05:39.670 --> 05:41.870]  If it's good, save it for the podcast.
[05:42.090 --> 05:42.790]  Shut up, Gavin.
[05:42.830 --> 05:43.970]  I'm trying to tell this story.
[05:45.730 --> 05:48.590]  I said, no, I didn't hear it.
[05:48.970 --> 05:50.530]  You're the fucking worst.
[05:50.530 --> 05:52.830]  Quiet for 20 seconds.
[05:52.830 --> 05:54.750]  I'm just trying to get this out.
[05:55.370 --> 06:00.570]  Geoff then said, the reason why you haven't heard my Favreau story is I don't have one.
[06:00.710 --> 06:02.450]  I just made it up right now.
[06:02.690 --> 06:03.930]  There's no point to it.
[06:04.470 --> 06:09.510]  So yeah, now that we're in this bizarre text conversation today from earlier, I blame you
[06:09.510 --> 06:12.410]  because you're just out here saying stuff for no reason.
[06:12.790 --> 06:13.530]  There's no point.
[06:13.790 --> 06:14.770]  There's no punchline.
[06:14.970 --> 06:15.830]  It's just bizarre.
[06:16.510 --> 06:17.570]  I don't know what you're doing.
[06:17.970 --> 06:20.610]  Okay, for the sake of the audience, explain what...
[06:20.610 --> 06:21.370]  I don't even know.
[06:21.550 --> 06:23.650]  What happened in the text conversation, the three of us did?
[06:23.650 --> 06:24.290]  Yeah, I don't know.
[06:24.350 --> 06:25.770]  That's what I was trying to get to the bottom of.
[06:26.150 --> 06:27.050]  He blames me.
[06:27.530 --> 06:30.130]  I think it was really, really self-explanatory.
[06:30.430 --> 06:32.690]  I'll tell you where things went off the rail for me, okay?
[06:32.810 --> 06:33.630]  I'll go to it right now.
[06:33.670 --> 06:34.610]  We're talking back and forth.
[06:35.030 --> 06:40.050]  Geoff had an idea about a Halo concept that I feel like everyone just plays Halo the way
[06:40.050 --> 06:41.210]  he thought was a unique way to play.
[06:41.530 --> 06:42.790]  I don't think it's a unique way to play.
[06:42.790 --> 06:47.650]  I just don't think that people go out of their way to kill every enemy on every map.
[06:48.030 --> 06:49.590]  Yeah, well, I don't...
[06:50.270 --> 06:51.510]  You want to clear the area, though.
[06:51.970 --> 06:53.030]  You weren't messing with me?
[06:53.590 --> 06:53.870]  When?
[06:54.410 --> 06:55.530]  With that conversation.
[06:56.030 --> 07:00.010]  No, I was just thinking about Halo, and I thought, have I killed every enemy in Halo?
[07:00.170 --> 07:03.330]  And I thought, probably not, because I tend to run by, like,
[07:03.430 --> 07:06.170]  banshees and ghosts that I don't need to shoot in the air, or...
[07:06.170 --> 07:11.610]  I've put a screenshot of what it looks like for me.
[07:12.050 --> 07:16.370]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're missing part.
[07:16.450 --> 07:17.350]  You're missing one message.
[07:17.430 --> 07:18.470]  Oh, where's the...
[07:19.430 --> 07:21.070]  So that's where it started for me.
[07:21.150 --> 07:21.990]  That's why I was like...
[07:22.610 --> 07:27.370]  That's why later on, like, that was going back and forth, and I just said...
[07:29.450 --> 07:31.190]  And I just said, in the middle of you,
[07:31.230 --> 07:33.370]  you got back and forth like five, six times to what Halo,
[07:33.770 --> 07:37.390]  and I just said, where is the beginning of this conversation?
[07:37.770 --> 07:38.530]  You didn't miss much.
[07:38.610 --> 07:39.330]  You missed one message.
[07:39.330 --> 07:42.190]  You both ignored me, and then carried on.
[07:42.190 --> 07:45.030]  Well, because you were being an idiot, because the beginning was right there.
[07:45.110 --> 07:45.770]  You're being stupid.
[07:46.010 --> 07:48.310]  That's where the conversation went wrong for me, is when you talk.
[07:48.310 --> 07:53.950]  The conversation then went on to, like, Willamette in Dead Rising,
[07:54.290 --> 07:55.610]  and then you were talking about ice cream.
[07:55.690 --> 07:59.050]  So I just said, after... this is probably, like, 20 messages later,
[07:59.170 --> 08:02.270]  20 messages on my phone going blah, blah, blah, and I don't know what's happening.
[08:02.650 --> 08:05.190]  So I wrote, is this the beginning of a new conversation,
[08:05.270 --> 08:07.350]  or is this still halfway through the other one?
[08:07.870 --> 08:09.170]  And then you just carried on.
[08:09.170 --> 08:13.550]  And then I just tried to start my own middle of a conversation,
[08:13.730 --> 08:15.770]  which definitely confused both of you.
[08:16.370 --> 08:21.590]  Andrew said, it's like I walked out of the room, missed something, and just came back in.
[08:21.830 --> 08:25.810]  I said, it's like I woke up in a room that didn't exist when I went to sleep.
[08:26.290 --> 08:28.110]  We were all just very confused.
[08:28.710 --> 08:30.250]  I got confused by this.
[08:30.370 --> 08:31.770]  This is where it went off the rails for me.
[08:32.390 --> 08:33.670]  This is... well, I had the beginning.
[08:33.790 --> 08:34.710]  I have all the context.
[08:35.270 --> 08:37.810]  My one line was, have you killed...
[08:37.810 --> 08:40.670]  Do you think you've killed every enemy in Halo?
[08:40.850 --> 08:41.650]  I think was the first thing.
[08:41.710 --> 08:42.730]  It was the beginning of the conversation.
[08:43.010 --> 08:43.790]  Well, that's important.
[08:44.310 --> 08:47.370]  The last level of reach they do is in the beginning of the conversation.
[08:48.350 --> 08:51.990]  Well, Andrew and I didn't know that for some magical reason,
[08:52.370 --> 08:54.370]  your phone ain't part of the conversation.
[08:54.550 --> 08:55.810]  How the fuck do I know?
[08:56.270 --> 08:56.990]  How do I know?
[08:57.070 --> 08:57.250]  You wouldn't tell me.
[08:57.570 --> 08:58.970]  You just kept ignoring me.
[08:59.230 --> 09:00.890]  Because you were saying dumb shit.
[09:01.150 --> 09:02.430]  I thought it was a pivot.
[09:02.730 --> 09:03.830]  Nobody believed you.
[09:04.190 --> 09:05.390]  It's not that I didn't believe him.
[09:05.470 --> 09:07.790]  I just thought he thought it was a weird subject change.
[09:08.150 --> 09:09.030]  I agree.
[09:09.490 --> 09:11.830]  Well, also, you can look at it.
[09:11.950 --> 09:17.530]  And the last thing that we had talked about was Andrew and wanting to try another salad.
[09:18.390 --> 09:23.110]  And it ended mid-conversation and then picked up 24 hours later with a new conversation.
[09:23.110 --> 09:24.670]  So I thought he was referencing that.
[09:25.290 --> 09:27.590]  Oh, no, I was paranoid that you were messing with me.
[09:27.710 --> 09:28.750]  And then you started ignoring me.
[09:28.810 --> 09:30.510]  And I was like, they're definitely messing with me.
[09:30.570 --> 09:32.030]  I just thought y'all were messing with me.
[09:32.170 --> 09:33.390]  It's the paranoia again.
[09:33.570 --> 09:34.090]  It's back.
[09:34.790 --> 09:35.570]  It's so bad.
[09:35.730 --> 09:35.910]  Okay.
[09:36.110 --> 09:36.790]  Well, what do you...
[09:36.790 --> 09:37.050]  Okay.
[09:37.050 --> 09:38.930]  So you asked Geoff.
[09:39.010 --> 09:41.430]  Geoff, you asked Gavin, do you kill every enemy in Halo?
[09:41.830 --> 09:43.410]  Gavin never replies to this.
[09:43.610 --> 09:44.510]  I didn't see it.
[09:46.110 --> 09:47.190]  Okay, so now I'm confused.
[09:47.290 --> 09:50.230]  So, Gavin, you were just saying shit because that's why it was confusing.
[09:50.630 --> 09:52.550]  Because you said, then you'll never guess what showed up.
[09:52.630 --> 09:53.430]  It was the blue one.
[09:53.650 --> 09:54.670]  I said, blue what?
[09:54.790 --> 09:56.970]  Which heightened the confusion of it.
[09:57.430 --> 09:59.110]  Geoff said elite.
[09:59.430 --> 10:01.710]  I was like fucking baffled at this point.
[10:01.770 --> 10:03.410]  I have no clue what either of you are talking about.
[10:03.410 --> 10:04.770]  I was just making it all about Halo.
[10:04.890 --> 10:06.450]  As soon as you said blue, I just assumed they were...
[10:07.150 --> 10:09.190]  What a fucking disaster.
[10:09.370 --> 10:09.510]  Yeah.
[10:09.790 --> 10:13.370]  One of my messages in the middle was, then you'll never guess what showed up.
[10:13.450 --> 10:14.450]  It was the blue one.
[10:14.570 --> 10:14.930]  Exclamation.
[10:15.070 --> 10:19.490]  Because I was trying to just have a middle of my own story that would be confusing for you to read.
[10:20.070 --> 10:24.450]  I was just putting in what couldn't possibly be the beginning of a story.
[10:25.250 --> 10:25.970]  Oh, man.
[10:26.330 --> 10:27.010]  Also, I don't...
[10:27.650 --> 10:29.430]  I said, I'll do a thing next week.
[10:29.550 --> 10:30.650]  And then Geoff replied.
[10:30.750 --> 10:32.890]  I think you just started a new one with that text.
[10:33.010 --> 10:34.010]  I have no idea what that means.
[10:34.370 --> 10:34.970]  That is really...
[10:34.970 --> 10:36.970]  I was replying to Gavin, I think.
[10:37.810 --> 10:39.370]  Well, that was our day.
[10:39.510 --> 10:40.210]  This is how we've been.
[10:40.470 --> 10:41.510]  And now we're doing this show.
[10:41.910 --> 10:44.370]  It's been a great communication day for all of us.
[10:44.650 --> 10:45.690]  I've got a headache already.
[10:46.190 --> 10:51.930]  It breaks my fucking heart that I can no longer communicate with my two best friends.
[10:52.350 --> 10:53.990]  But it's just not possible.
[10:55.930 --> 11:02.310]  Like, we failed at basic human communication there.
[11:02.890 --> 11:03.270]  We did.
[11:03.930 --> 11:04.790]  It was a disaster.
[11:04.970 --> 11:09.890]  We should screenshot every page of that conversation and Instagram it because that is good.
[11:10.270 --> 11:11.410]  Okay, I can do that.
[11:12.070 --> 11:13.030]  I'll make sure...
[11:13.030 --> 11:16.270]  We'll have to verify to make sure we all got all of the comments.
[11:16.750 --> 11:17.850]  We'll all screenshot it.
[11:17.930 --> 11:19.330]  We'll all cross-reference.
[11:20.510 --> 11:24.350]  I think the biggest problem is that stupid Andrew's phone isn't on iMessage.
[11:24.430 --> 11:25.390]  So half the shit...
[11:25.390 --> 11:26.770]  I don't have any signal ever.
[11:27.310 --> 11:29.830]  So half the stuff I don't ever see when it's a group chat.
[11:30.090 --> 11:30.930]  Who gave me that phone?
[11:33.210 --> 11:33.890]  Oh, yeah.
[11:34.470 --> 11:34.790]  Yeah.
[11:35.710 --> 11:36.030]  What?
[11:39.990 --> 11:41.090]  How's it working out for you?
[11:41.150 --> 11:41.650]  It's great.
[11:41.790 --> 11:42.150]  I love it.
[11:42.230 --> 11:43.130]  It's way better than what I had.
[11:43.590 --> 11:44.110]  Thank you.
[11:44.610 --> 11:45.530]  It's a great gift by you.
[11:45.690 --> 11:47.310]  Oh, Christ.
[11:48.810 --> 11:52.050]  I had a great anxiety moment with Geoff on text.
[11:52.170 --> 11:52.950]  He doesn't even know this.
[11:53.010 --> 11:53.850]  This is all in my head.
[11:54.210 --> 11:55.730]  I had a random, like, bed idea.
[11:55.870 --> 11:57.390]  And sometimes I phrase things...
[11:57.390 --> 11:59.250]  Like, in my head, I map out a conversation.
[11:59.370 --> 12:01.670]  And then I phrase it in a way that doesn't reflect that.
[12:02.130 --> 12:03.750]  I had a random, like, bed idea.
[12:03.890 --> 12:05.650]  And I texted Geoff about it.
[12:05.930 --> 12:08.230]  And I text it in a way of, like, this is...
[12:08.230 --> 12:08.910]  I just had this.
[12:08.950 --> 12:09.810]  I'm going to forget about it.
[12:09.870 --> 12:11.770]  I can't do this for months if I'm going to do this.
[12:12.010 --> 12:12.870]  I'm going to place it here.
[12:12.950 --> 12:13.970]  So it's physically somewhere.
[12:14.430 --> 12:17.990]  And in my head, I was like, Geoff is going to respond to this.
[12:18.050 --> 12:18.890]  Then we could talk about it.
[12:18.930 --> 12:20.270]  Really, I just want to talk to Geoff.
[12:20.350 --> 12:22.230]  But I'm setting it up as an entry with this way.
[12:22.630 --> 12:24.130]  Geoff never replied all day.
[12:24.310 --> 12:29.350]  And in my head, it was like, oh, I look like a total asshole that I'm using our text conversation
[12:29.350 --> 12:30.310]  as a post-it wall.
[12:30.470 --> 12:32.330]  Is what I thought for literally the whole day.
[12:32.630 --> 12:33.730]  And Geoff was just like, I'm busy.
[12:33.730 --> 12:35.070]  Shooting a thing.
[12:35.150 --> 12:35.350]  Sorry.
[12:35.810 --> 12:37.690]  But the whole day was just anxiety.
[12:37.830 --> 12:40.210]  It was an anxiety thing in my head of, like, I fucked this up.
[12:40.330 --> 12:43.430]  So then I texted again later to make it a more direct question.
[12:43.490 --> 12:46.930]  Because I didn't want it to just be like, I'm using your fucking text conversation
[12:46.930 --> 12:47.950]  as a post-it wall.
[12:48.710 --> 12:49.890]  Anxiety all day about it.
[12:50.070 --> 12:52.250]  We need to go back to basics in our communication.
[12:52.510 --> 12:53.550]  We need to rekindle.
[12:53.890 --> 12:54.770]  We need a hard reset.
[12:55.550 --> 12:58.310]  We need to declare any pranks that are currently in progress.
[12:59.390 --> 12:59.830]  Jesus.
[13:01.150 --> 13:04.870]  For the record, Andrew, I saw your text immediately.
[13:05.150 --> 13:05.730]  But you're right.
[13:05.790 --> 13:09.110]  I was on set and I was not in a place where I could respond.
[13:09.410 --> 13:10.590]  I thought about it all day long.
[13:10.710 --> 13:12.130]  I think it's a brilliant idea.
[13:12.530 --> 13:17.170]  And I would love to participate in some way when it's time to do that bet.
[13:17.490 --> 13:21.730]  OK, well, yeah, like I realized as soon as you messaged it, but I literally I had spent
[13:21.730 --> 13:26.610]  time that day throughout it constantly going just anxiety brain of like that comes off
[13:26.610 --> 13:29.030]  like that did not read the way I attended it to.
[13:29.150 --> 13:30.810]  I hope they didn't misinterpret it.
[13:31.050 --> 13:34.970]  Do you think it's possible to upset me or offend me?
[13:35.770 --> 13:39.190]  No, but I just like not even it's not even that you'd be upset or offended.
[13:39.410 --> 13:42.530]  I felt like it came across in a way that I didn't intend it to.
[13:43.030 --> 13:46.850]  Like I did it with the concept of this will then lead to this.
[13:46.950 --> 13:48.050]  And then nothing happened.
[13:48.530 --> 13:50.070]  It was in my head like a domino fall.
[13:50.370 --> 13:55.370]  I'm going to be listen, I've been a real negative downer for a little bit
[13:56.010 --> 14:00.450]  based on, you know, just every every actual thing in my life.
[14:00.790 --> 14:01.510]  It's fair.
[14:01.770 --> 14:05.110]  I'm going to be a little ray of sunshine for one moment.
[14:05.310 --> 14:13.590]  And I'm going to say all like all comedy bits aside, the pure honesty, the real Geoff Ramsey
[14:13.590 --> 14:20.270]  here, when I get a text from Gavin Free or Andrew Panton, when I see it pop up on my
[14:20.270 --> 14:21.970]  phone, it doesn't matter what it is.
[14:21.970 --> 14:25.250]  It makes it makes my heart feel good and I get excited.
[14:25.410 --> 14:27.050]  So you could be texting me.
[14:27.170 --> 14:30.470]  You could be texting me tax problems and it wouldn't matter.
[14:30.590 --> 14:33.110]  It still makes my day a little bit on the inside.
[14:33.410 --> 14:34.550]  So all right.
[14:34.550 --> 14:36.610]  And that's the only night that I'm done being nice.
[14:36.850 --> 14:37.370]  OK, well, you know what?
[14:37.370 --> 14:38.470]  You did a nice thing.
[14:38.910 --> 14:43.570]  I want to do a nice thing for you, Geoff, because you brought you brought Kanye West and Kim
[14:43.570 --> 14:46.510]  Kardashian on a jet ski, which didn't turn out to be them.
[14:46.630 --> 14:48.090]  But it was a moment of joy.
[14:48.210 --> 14:49.210]  It brought two strangers.
[14:49.590 --> 14:50.670]  It's a brief moment of joy.
[14:50.670 --> 14:52.710]  Have you seen Jay-Z on a jet ski?
[14:53.130 --> 14:53.970]  I don't think so, though.
[14:54.030 --> 14:54.610]  Oh, OK.
[14:54.750 --> 14:57.230]  I'm going to know if you would know if you have.
[14:57.410 --> 15:00.630]  Cactus in our server posted this when we're talking about jet ski stuff.
[15:01.370 --> 15:03.330]  Maybe the greatest jet ski photo of all time.
[15:03.430 --> 15:04.690]  I can't stop thinking about it.
[15:07.530 --> 15:10.950]  I have never seen anyone less amused.
[15:11.150 --> 15:13.210]  He also looks like he's 99.
[15:13.550 --> 15:16.790]  The shoulders up like it's just everything about it.
[15:16.890 --> 15:18.370]  So there's a little joy to your life.
[15:18.370 --> 15:23.550]  I don't think I've ever seen a photo where I'd be so ill-equipped to guess someone's age.
[15:23.670 --> 15:27.330]  I think he could be 30 or 70.
[15:27.450 --> 15:28.350]  I have no idea.
[15:28.790 --> 15:33.450]  That might be the least cool a cool person has ever looked.
[15:33.990 --> 15:34.570]  Ever.
[15:36.050 --> 15:38.330]  So it's like Jay-Z, the accountant.
[15:39.710 --> 15:41.210]  It's on the way to work.
[15:42.910 --> 15:44.310]  Where's his visibility spout?
[15:44.430 --> 15:44.990]  That's what I want to know.
[15:48.570 --> 15:52.870]  So thank you, Geoff, for introducing because it led us to Jay-Z on a jet ski,
[15:53.050 --> 15:56.110]  which is actually him and is one of the best photos I've ever seen.
[15:56.790 --> 15:59.230]  Oh, man, that's that's great.
[15:59.330 --> 15:59.570]  Thank you.
[15:59.610 --> 16:00.790]  Thank you for sharing that back.
[16:00.890 --> 16:01.150]  That was.
[16:01.650 --> 16:01.670]  Yeah.
[16:01.710 --> 16:02.330]  Oh, of course.
[16:02.750 --> 16:06.410]  I also I just wanted to the dryer, Geoff.
[16:06.410 --> 16:07.550]  I heard of you.
[16:07.630 --> 16:09.070]  Have you checked your dryer duct?
[16:09.150 --> 16:10.690]  Is your dryer duct clogged?
[16:11.830 --> 16:14.330]  Just curious if you've looked into that.
[16:14.350 --> 16:16.870]  Boy, do I have a new pet peeve.
[16:16.870 --> 16:18.930]  Oh, well, I have two.
[16:19.390 --> 16:22.230]  I had one for a while there that went away, but it came back.
[16:22.390 --> 16:27.210]  And that is when people text us the same fucking photo of the three cartoon characters
[16:27.210 --> 16:31.110]  that are supposed to represent every podcast show on Earth.
[16:31.590 --> 16:34.050]  It's been around for years.
[16:34.230 --> 16:35.090]  We've seen it.
[16:35.690 --> 16:42.390]  The other one is this new trend of seeking me out on every form of social media to tell me
[16:42.390 --> 16:47.490]  to clean my dryer vent because my dryer is overheating as if I'm not going to yell.
[16:47.650 --> 16:48.990]  I just I almost jumped into it.
[16:49.210 --> 16:50.410]  I'm just going to get calm.
[16:50.690 --> 16:54.410]  I'm going to get calm and easy, and I'm just going to say, hey, I appreciate the concern.
[16:54.830 --> 16:55.670]  But here's the deal.
[16:56.190 --> 16:57.290]  I'm not fucking stupid.
[16:57.550 --> 16:58.950]  It's the first thing I did.
[16:59.310 --> 17:02.010]  And it's the first thing every repairman says.
[17:02.130 --> 17:03.310]  He goes, oh, I bet I know what.
[17:03.530 --> 17:05.590]  Oh, well, it's usually this.
[17:05.670 --> 17:06.930]  But yeah, yours is all clear.
[17:06.970 --> 17:07.470]  It's good to go.
[17:07.810 --> 17:09.490]  And I go, yeah, I already I took care of that.
[17:09.490 --> 17:12.030]  Yeah, it might be a problem with your motherboard.
[17:12.150 --> 17:14.950]  Maybe I'll have to run some diagnostics.
[17:15.310 --> 17:19.770]  So you don't have to you have to send me the dryer vent thing ever again.
[17:20.190 --> 17:20.830]  I'm aware.
[17:21.230 --> 17:22.490]  I'm fully aware of it.
[17:22.530 --> 17:23.810]  Well, you're asking for it now.
[17:24.090 --> 17:25.390]  Yeah, I mean, have you fixed it?
[17:25.450 --> 17:26.810]  Is the dryer still overheating?
[17:27.250 --> 17:27.930]  Oh, all the time.
[17:28.050 --> 17:30.210]  OK, so what you're saying is you've done the vent.
[17:30.290 --> 17:34.390]  But if other people have other suggestions for which you may be able to fix Geoff's dryer,
[17:34.530 --> 17:38.070]  feel free to send send all the advice they possibly can is what I'm hearing.
[17:38.070 --> 17:39.530]  Have your problems mostly gone away?
[17:41.390 --> 17:54.690]  Well, I mean, I've I've chosen gotten I've chosen I've chosen for my sanity
[17:55.870 --> 17:57.790]  for just a little bit too.
[17:57.990 --> 17:59.730]  Maybe they haven't gone away, but I have.
[18:00.310 --> 18:01.030]  I have.
[18:01.130 --> 18:01.810]  I'm not.
[18:01.910 --> 18:03.270]  I'm ignoring them right now.
[18:03.310 --> 18:05.730]  Yeah, that's living as if they don't exist.
[18:05.730 --> 18:11.370]  Yeah, I'm living in I'm living in an amount of denial right now that that is necessary
[18:12.170 --> 18:17.230]  to maintain, I guess, my life.
[18:17.590 --> 18:21.950]  I wish you wouldn't ignore them because I feel like I feel like I'm getting them.
[18:22.290 --> 18:22.510]  Really?
[18:22.630 --> 18:24.510]  Oh, what does that happen to you?
[18:24.790 --> 18:25.970]  It's just been a bit of a week.
[18:26.430 --> 18:28.990]  It's been I think I've faced myself.
[18:29.010 --> 18:30.150]  Honestly, I think I've done it.
[18:31.650 --> 18:32.470]  What did you do?
[18:32.470 --> 18:37.010]  I was saying last week or whatever, four weeks ago, whenever we last did one of these,
[18:37.490 --> 18:40.290]  that I feel like I'm not getting problems because Geoff's got all the problems.
[18:42.310 --> 18:43.590]  Suddenly I got problems.
[18:44.090 --> 18:46.250]  So Geoff and I have been struggling to hang out.
[18:46.530 --> 18:46.750]  Yeah.
[18:46.750 --> 18:53.210]  Every time we make plans, a giant storm hovers over Austin for two to three weeks.
[18:53.290 --> 18:56.370]  Every time it shits it down 10 days straight with rain.
[18:57.010 --> 19:01.570]  So I was looking on the weather this past week and it's looking pretty good.
[19:01.570 --> 19:04.650]  So I was thinking, all right, I think, you know, I think it's passed.
[19:05.110 --> 19:06.430]  I'm going to test something out.
[19:07.590 --> 19:13.330]  So I invited a bunch of people over for pretty much everyone I like, except for Geoff.
[19:13.650 --> 19:17.830]  I chose to leave him out and I thought this will test the weather out.
[19:18.390 --> 19:25.030]  First off, I'd like to point out, incredibly offensive, but also I was out of town.
[19:25.290 --> 19:25.830]  Yeah, I know.
[19:25.970 --> 19:29.130]  The entire week for a myriad of reasons.
[19:29.130 --> 19:30.690]  Talk about life problems.
[19:30.810 --> 19:32.250]  Jesus Christ, we won't even get into it.
[19:32.390 --> 19:34.190]  But yeah, let's continue.
[19:34.490 --> 19:36.410]  Yeah, well, I found out afterwards that you were gone.
[19:36.510 --> 19:37.850]  So it worked out pretty perfectly.
[19:37.990 --> 19:41.070]  But it was a deliberate choice just to look at your name in my context.
[19:41.410 --> 19:42.430]  Just scroll right on by.
[19:42.770 --> 19:47.270]  Anyway, and the weather was phenomenal.
[19:47.610 --> 19:48.950]  It was amazing.
[19:49.170 --> 19:50.690]  We had a bunch of people over.
[19:51.030 --> 19:51.550]  It was sunny.
[19:51.610 --> 19:54.890]  It was about 37 degrees Celsius, boiling hot.
[19:55.130 --> 19:56.350]  Perfect weather to be outside.
[19:56.450 --> 19:57.710]  Well, it's a bit hot to be outside, to be honest.
[19:57.710 --> 19:58.350]  But we're hanging out.
[19:58.450 --> 20:00.750]  We're doing all that, you know, outdoor stuff.
[20:00.810 --> 20:01.450]  Listen to music.
[20:01.550 --> 20:02.130]  It was great.
[20:02.550 --> 20:04.370]  Then we ordered some Rudies.
[20:04.570 --> 20:05.270]  Thought this was great.
[20:05.350 --> 20:10.170]  We'll just get, you know, like three pounds of brisket, get a load of sausage, get some ribs and stuff.
[20:10.790 --> 20:14.110]  And we'd been outside for probably three hours at this point.
[20:14.270 --> 20:15.750]  We sat down to the Rudies, got it all out.
[20:16.610 --> 20:22.590]  And probably within two minutes of starting to eat, there were just a load of flies.
[20:23.070 --> 20:26.750]  There was suddenly like 10 flies flying around us.
[20:26.750 --> 20:27.830]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[20:27.870 --> 20:29.030]  I can smell the food or something.
[20:29.410 --> 20:30.230]  We're trying to eat.
[20:30.710 --> 20:37.770]  And all of a sudden it's like, if I'm not actively swatting my food, there are like eight flies on my plate.
[20:37.870 --> 20:39.330]  And we were just like, what is going on?
[20:39.330 --> 20:42.970]  And by the time we could even figure out, like, by the time everyone was noticing all these flies,
[20:43.390 --> 20:45.750]  there was like 70 flies around us.
[20:45.950 --> 20:47.750]  I was just like, Oh my God.
[20:47.750 --> 20:51.210]  It was like one of the plagues from the Bible has come down on us.
[20:51.310 --> 20:55.350]  It was like, we couldn't even, we had to just quickly scoff our food, run inside.
[20:55.350 --> 20:56.130]  Everyone went home.
[20:56.130 --> 20:59.830]  And I just left all the stuff out there because I was trying to decide, like, how do I...
[21:00.390 --> 21:01.230]  Everybody went home.
[21:02.210 --> 21:03.070]  It was bad.
[21:03.950 --> 21:10.510]  Honestly, like even away from the plates, like there were, there were like 50 flies on the couch,
[21:10.510 --> 21:12.570]  on the outdoor, like patio furniture.
[21:12.830 --> 21:14.350]  I was like, what is going on?
[21:14.750 --> 21:18.030]  So I was like, I went and got out one of those fly zapper things.
[21:18.150 --> 21:22.930]  I hung it on a stake that I put in the grass and I just let that work its magic.
[21:22.930 --> 21:26.750]  And I was like, Oh God, I guess I'll figure that out later.
[21:27.630 --> 21:30.630]  Then, uh, for dinner, this is like much later that day.
[21:30.710 --> 21:31.870]  I'm going to put something in the discord here.
[21:32.950 --> 21:35.150]  Then I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.
[21:35.630 --> 21:35.910]  Okay.
[21:36.090 --> 21:38.670]  So I thought, you know, I'll let that zapper do its work.
[21:38.970 --> 21:40.230]  I'll, I'll deal with that later.
[21:40.310 --> 21:42.210]  It's too, it's like scary out there.
[21:42.230 --> 21:42.710]  There's so many flies.
[21:42.750 --> 21:43.910]  I'm worried I'm going to inhale them.
[21:44.170 --> 21:45.390]  And just normal, just house flies.
[21:45.890 --> 21:48.510]  Sat down to watch Breaking Bad with a bit of dinner.
[21:49.470 --> 21:53.410]  The episode I was on was the fricking one with the fly.
[22:00.230 --> 22:00.710]  Then...
[22:02.090 --> 22:02.830]  Posting what?
[22:03.910 --> 22:04.870]  Compressing video.
[22:05.630 --> 22:06.530]  Are we getting a video?
[22:06.990 --> 22:07.790]  You get a video?
[22:08.030 --> 22:08.770]  Holy shit.
[22:09.130 --> 22:10.230]  Then my food arrived.
[22:10.590 --> 22:12.010]  I feel like I'm missing something.
[22:12.890 --> 22:14.690]  What, what was, what was the problem with the food?
[22:15.150 --> 22:16.690]  The damn fly in the food.
[22:16.690 --> 22:19.270]  They delivered my food with a fly in it.
[22:20.270 --> 22:21.790]  Oh, I didn't see it.
[22:22.350 --> 22:22.870]  On the cake.
[22:23.270 --> 22:23.850]  Crawling around in there.
[22:23.970 --> 22:24.230]  Yeah.
[22:24.390 --> 22:27.690]  What is going on with your, you have been plagued.
[22:27.910 --> 22:29.710]  I think my theory is this.
[22:29.910 --> 22:32.010]  I choked to death on a rib or something.
[22:32.190 --> 22:32.750]  I'm dead.
[22:33.190 --> 22:35.690]  And the flies are just letting me know that I've died.
[22:35.890 --> 22:36.890]  I'm rotting somewhere.
[22:37.030 --> 22:39.170]  But I haven't known, like my spirit is just continuing.
[22:39.330 --> 22:41.350]  It still makes face every Thursday.
[22:43.070 --> 22:44.210]  I gotta be honest with you.
[22:44.210 --> 22:46.670]  I don't know that, assuming that's true.
[22:46.770 --> 22:49.810]  I don't know that it affects me or Andrew in any way.
[22:49.950 --> 22:52.610]  Yeah, I mean, as long as you continue to show up.
[22:52.870 --> 22:53.030]  Yeah.
[22:53.050 --> 22:53.530]  Yeah.
[22:53.530 --> 22:55.910]  Anyway, only halfway through.
[22:58.690 --> 23:03.490]  Waking up every morning this week to like half my power off.
[23:03.590 --> 23:05.470]  Like, like all this shit on one side of the house.
[23:06.170 --> 23:09.710]  And I keep, I'm like, oh, this break is tripped.
[23:09.850 --> 23:12.650]  So I keep going to the garage, resetting a breaker.
[23:12.650 --> 23:15.100]  Then I've realized what it is.
[23:16.210 --> 23:21.410]  Every night at 2am, the little fly zapper I've got outside is just sat there on.
[23:21.570 --> 23:25.690]  And my sprinklers come on and start spraying water in the fly zapper.
[23:27.010 --> 23:29.190]  And shorting out and tripping the breaker.
[23:29.610 --> 23:29.810]  No.
[23:30.630 --> 23:33.570]  Took me like four days to realize why my breaker kept tripping.
[23:35.190 --> 23:39.150]  Because when the freeze happened, it like broke all my sprinkler system.
[23:39.310 --> 23:41.710]  Like the power was off for so long that it was all reset.
[23:41.710 --> 23:45.250]  And I don't know how to, I don't know how to like mess with the sprinkler settings.
[23:45.370 --> 23:48.390]  I don't even, I don't even like sprinkling my grass.
[23:50.210 --> 23:52.630]  What do you mean you don't like sprinkling your grass?
[23:52.730 --> 23:54.390]  So what do we do? It's waste.
[23:56.850 --> 23:58.770]  They've been coming on without me knowing.
[23:59.970 --> 24:02.370]  Just shorting out half my shit every night.
[24:03.830 --> 24:05.710]  I finally figured out what was going on there.
[24:05.750 --> 24:06.490]  I was like, oh, brilliant.
[24:06.610 --> 24:07.530]  Okay, we finally got this.
[24:07.590 --> 24:09.030]  I'm going to unplug this damn thing.
[24:09.170 --> 24:11.050]  There's still a load of flies, but I'll get over it.
[24:11.470 --> 24:16.290]  That's in my downstairs, it's like a patio area, but there's a room above it.
[24:16.390 --> 24:16.930]  You know, there's a roof.
[24:18.110 --> 24:21.170]  So I thought, I know what will clear out some of these flies.
[24:21.550 --> 24:23.270]  I have a fan out there.
[24:23.730 --> 24:27.070]  There's a fan on the ceiling above the patio where we're all eating.
[24:27.850 --> 24:30.930]  And I thought, well, honestly, a lot of stuff here,
[24:31.090 --> 24:32.510]  it blows my mind that people use them.
[24:32.550 --> 24:34.030]  Like what's the point of an outdoor fan?
[24:34.430 --> 24:35.490]  I've never used the thing.
[24:35.910 --> 24:37.990]  But honestly, it's been so hot that I thought, you know,
[24:38.290 --> 24:39.890]  we might as well, I might as well try and turn it on.
[24:39.890 --> 24:42.750]  So earlier today, I thought I'll have lunch out here
[24:42.750 --> 24:45.310]  and I'll use the fan to sort of cool this area down
[24:45.310 --> 24:47.890]  and hopefully blow away all the flies.
[24:48.510 --> 24:50.050]  First, I had to look for the switch.
[24:50.230 --> 24:52.190]  I don't know where the switch for this fan is.
[24:52.490 --> 24:53.470]  I found it inside.
[24:54.470 --> 24:55.610]  It's like on a panel of three.
[24:55.730 --> 24:57.250]  So I was like, one of these doesn't do anything.
[24:57.370 --> 24:57.870]  One is a light.
[24:58.330 --> 24:59.370]  This one might be the fan.
[24:59.630 --> 25:00.510]  I hit the switch.
[25:00.990 --> 25:02.450]  I saw the fan kind of go...
[25:03.730 --> 25:06.450]  and it turned a little bit and then stopped.
[25:06.970 --> 25:08.630]  So I went outside and I was just looking at it
[25:08.630 --> 25:09.270]  and it was going like...
[25:11.210 --> 25:14.370]  and it was like screeching, like, sound like scraping.
[25:14.630 --> 25:15.330]  It was turning around.
[25:15.410 --> 25:17.730]  I was like, what the hell's going on with that?
[25:17.850 --> 25:21.330]  And then suddenly it looked like, it looked like,
[25:21.370 --> 25:25.370]  like someone chucked out like 20 coffee beans out of the side.
[25:25.450 --> 25:26.530]  There's a crack in the fan.
[25:26.610 --> 25:29.650]  It just started leaking like mud and beans and everything.
[25:30.130 --> 25:31.910]  And I was like, what the hell is that?
[25:31.950 --> 25:34.610]  Then all the beans started flying around.
[25:34.670 --> 25:36.010]  And I was like, it's wasps.
[25:36.010 --> 25:39.550]  There's a wasp nest inside my fan.
[25:39.610 --> 25:40.630]  It's never been turned on.
[25:40.670 --> 25:41.990]  It's been turned on for the first time.
[25:42.190 --> 25:45.230]  It's like crunching its way through this wasp nest,
[25:45.890 --> 25:46.950]  ejecting them at the side.
[25:47.030 --> 25:48.230]  They're all like rolling around the floor.
[25:48.510 --> 25:54.730]  I quickly run inside and honestly, like 70 wasps is flying out of my fan,
[25:54.830 --> 25:55.810]  getting killed by it.
[25:56.110 --> 25:57.650]  It's littering the place.
[25:57.770 --> 25:58.770]  There's no flies anymore.
[25:59.190 --> 26:01.250]  Now there's about 70 wasps.
[26:01.350 --> 26:03.110]  There's about 40 of them dead on the floor.
[26:03.210 --> 26:04.690]  They've all been ground up like paste.
[26:05.250 --> 26:07.490]  Geoff, can you pay attention to your problems?
[26:07.790 --> 26:08.910]  Can you take them back?
[26:09.270 --> 26:11.230]  I'm living in a weird nightmare house.
[26:11.310 --> 26:12.110]  I don't know what's happened.
[26:12.350 --> 26:13.090]  I've died.
[26:14.490 --> 26:18.150]  You just wanted to eat lunch and you created a doomsday event.
[26:18.590 --> 26:19.990]  Oh my god.
[26:20.350 --> 26:25.510]  You have a, you have like, that's like a dead rising combo weapon.
[26:25.810 --> 26:31.050]  You combine a wasp nest with fans and now you shoot wasps at people.
[26:31.490 --> 26:32.470]  Oh my god.
[26:32.470 --> 26:37.410]  If there were people over when I did that, it's literally right above the little couch
[26:37.410 --> 26:38.070]  we were all sat on.
[26:38.170 --> 26:43.690]  If I was already sat down, I would have been showered with wasp parts and wasp stings and
[26:43.690 --> 26:43.890]  shit.
[26:44.230 --> 26:44.970]  It was mental.
[26:45.190 --> 26:48.490]  It was, it's like biblical level plague stuff.
[26:48.970 --> 26:49.250]  I'm terrified.
[26:50.930 --> 26:52.730]  Here's what I'll say to that, okay?
[26:53.190 --> 27:01.590]  It seems to me, Gavin, that your problem started when you excluded your best friend from the
[27:01.590 --> 27:01.970]  invite.
[27:01.970 --> 27:02.630]  I agree.
[27:02.710 --> 27:04.830]  That seems like it went downhill.
[27:05.670 --> 27:11.250]  Now, I'm not saying that that's the cause of it, but uh, I might be a little careful
[27:11.250 --> 27:14.010]  who I don't invite to my next get together.
[27:14.570 --> 27:17.810]  Yeah, I feel like that is the core of this face.
[27:18.070 --> 27:20.110]  I've just, I don't know what's going on.
[27:20.510 --> 27:22.010]  This was all stuff, just dormant.
[27:22.150 --> 27:23.310]  I haven't, I've not done anything.
[27:23.870 --> 27:24.810]  If it helps.
[27:25.050 --> 27:28.650]  I wasn't even going to bring this up because I'm not letting, I'm not letting the world
[27:28.650 --> 27:29.190]  get me down.
[27:29.190 --> 27:33.030]  Okay, so uh, you know, do I have a dryer issue?
[27:33.250 --> 27:33.510]  Yeah.
[27:34.170 --> 27:37.870]  Do uh, do I still have a floor issue that I don't talk about a lot?
[27:37.950 --> 27:38.250]  Yeah.
[27:38.530 --> 27:39.990]  Do I still have the cracks in the ceiling?
[27:40.070 --> 27:40.790]  Of course.
[27:42.590 --> 27:45.610]  Does the, is it dark in the fridge in the dryer?
[27:45.730 --> 27:47.010]  It's fucking pitch black.
[27:47.870 --> 27:48.750]  Is it cold?
[27:48.910 --> 27:51.090]  Yeah, I noticed a lot of condensation in the fridge yesterday.
[27:51.170 --> 27:52.750]  I'm not sure, not sure what's going on there.
[27:53.250 --> 27:54.290]  Is that a concern?
[27:56.010 --> 27:56.370]  100%.
[27:56.370 --> 27:57.730]  Am I letting it get me down?
[27:57.970 --> 27:58.570]  Not today.
[27:58.570 --> 28:03.150]  Because if I do, uh, well, you know, I don't know.
[28:03.730 --> 28:08.070]  So uh, one new thing that I wasn't going to bring up though, but now I'll commiserate
[28:08.070 --> 28:12.370]  with you, is that uh, I've been noticing a lot of wasps in my house.
[28:12.550 --> 28:13.270]  Like inside the house.
[28:14.190 --> 28:19.150]  Luckily, I'm pretty good with the uh, with the fly, electric fly swatter uh, tennis racket
[28:19.150 --> 28:19.650]  now, you know?
[28:20.090 --> 28:25.410]  So I'm kind of like the John McEnroe of, of uh, killing flies with a tennis racket.
[28:25.410 --> 28:29.410]  Much in that I am angry like John McEnroe and I scream at them and yell at them and
[28:29.410 --> 28:30.450]  just, you know, throw fits.
[28:31.230 --> 28:33.270]  But I'm also uh, and I'm a poor sport.
[28:33.750 --> 28:35.210]  So I, I haven't been sweating it.
[28:35.310 --> 28:36.990]  I'll fucking kill a wasp just like I kill a fly.
[28:37.390 --> 28:41.770]  But after like four of them, you start to think like this is a, this is more than a coincidence,
[28:41.770 --> 28:42.110]  right?
[28:42.350 --> 28:45.930]  So I gotta go look around the house and I keep looking for where the hornet's nest or
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.390]  the fly, the wasp's nest is.
[28:47.590 --> 28:49.050]  And I can't find it and I can't find it.
[28:49.290 --> 28:54.190]  And then uh, then Emily saw one on the, on the front porch the other day and so she watched
[28:54.190 --> 28:54.790]  it for a while.
[28:54.790 --> 29:00.470]  And found out that, uh, there's a, the, my house is made of like, uh, rocks.
[29:00.930 --> 29:05.190]  Like, uh, I wish I hadn't said it like that.
[29:05.530 --> 29:09.530]  Uh, the facade of my house, the facade of my house is rock, right?
[29:09.750 --> 29:11.350]  Like, uh, bricked rock.
[29:12.070 --> 29:12.650]  And uh...
[29:12.650 --> 29:14.370]  Do your feet stick through the bottom of your car?
[29:14.730 --> 29:15.050]  Yeah.
[29:17.510 --> 29:19.270]  It's like he's one of the three pigs.
[29:20.410 --> 29:26.910]  And uh, so notice that, um, that there are, uh, lots of tiny holes between the rocks where
[29:26.910 --> 29:27.970]  like grout isn't.
[29:28.390 --> 29:33.270]  And apparently there's a whole network of wasps living in between the walls of my house.
[29:33.750 --> 29:36.910]  So I've just been spraying wasp shit in there every once in a while.
[29:37.170 --> 29:38.290]  Yeah, then the external wall.
[29:38.590 --> 29:39.770]  Not letting it get me down.
[29:40.390 --> 29:43.650]  Uh, anytime I see one, I just plug, plug the hole with a rock.
[29:44.070 --> 29:46.910]  I'll spray a little wasp stuff in there and then I plug that hole with a rock.
[29:47.230 --> 29:49.110]  Got a lot of rocks in the front of my house right now.
[29:49.590 --> 29:53.790]  So, uh, you know, they're not, they're not shooting out of fans at me.
[29:54.010 --> 29:58.010]  But um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't ring my doorbell if I were you.
[29:58.150 --> 29:58.750]  I'll say that.
[30:01.990 --> 30:04.850]  Maybe we're just gonna be locked in by wasps and that's why we can't hang out.
[30:05.930 --> 30:06.290]  Maybe.
[30:07.070 --> 30:10.610]  I'm honestly terrified if you two do hang out at this point because I feel like the
[30:10.610 --> 30:11.930]  curse will then move on to me.
[30:11.990 --> 30:15.130]  I feel like that's the only thing giving me protection at this point.
[30:15.450 --> 30:17.530]  Is the fact that you haven't been able to hang out.
[30:18.730 --> 30:19.530]  Oh Christ.
[30:19.810 --> 30:23.890]  I am, I want to say I'm sorry to hear about your, your issues.
[30:24.070 --> 30:29.450]  But, uh, man, does it, does it bring me a little bit of joy to hear somebody else's misery?
[30:29.870 --> 30:32.470]  I mean, it sounds like I'm still in the middle of it because the wasp thing was like,
[30:32.650 --> 30:34.390]  it was like two or three hours ago.
[30:38.670 --> 30:41.230]  I was gonna say, you know, the fly issue,
[30:41.530 --> 30:44.450]  you've probably got a dead something somewhere in your yard.
[30:45.310 --> 30:46.710]  Well, where though?
[30:46.710 --> 30:49.150]  Because the fly is hanging around outside the door.
[30:49.610 --> 30:55.130]  I don't know, man, but, uh, I would go look under a porch or maybe, uh, behind a tree and
[30:55.130 --> 30:59.050]  see if you got like a dead raccoon or somebody's cat or something, you know?
[30:59.650 --> 31:04.630]  I don't, I don't really understand the value of the singular fly device.
[31:04.890 --> 31:06.870]  The zapper that you have up to.
[31:07.010 --> 31:11.350]  It sounds like you have just a million flies on you at once.
[31:11.390 --> 31:12.770]  I don't know. I don't know why you had that up.
[31:13.270 --> 31:14.170]  What does that bring?
[31:14.250 --> 31:15.070]  Is that really helpful?
[31:15.430 --> 31:16.130]  That doing anything?
[31:16.130 --> 31:17.610]  They fly into it sometimes.
[31:17.730 --> 31:21.270]  Yeah, but there's like 10 million flies is what you're suggesting.
[31:21.330 --> 31:22.910]  It's like fucking using bubblegum.
[31:24.030 --> 31:25.250]  I felt like I should do something.
[31:25.410 --> 31:26.970]  What are we just sit there and let them eat the house?
[31:27.090 --> 31:28.470]  What do you want me to do?
[31:28.590 --> 31:31.470]  I feel like you've done minimal effort is what I'm saying to deal with these flies.
[31:32.090 --> 31:33.070]  You want me to get a big net?
[31:33.130 --> 31:33.810]  What do you want from me?
[31:33.970 --> 31:36.130]  I think you need at least multiple ones of those.
[31:36.190 --> 31:37.610]  I think one clearly isn't enough.
[31:37.710 --> 31:39.150]  You're dealing with a fucking fly attack.
[31:39.290 --> 31:40.590]  You're saying biblical proportions.
[31:41.070 --> 31:42.190]  You got one fly zapper.
[31:42.510 --> 31:45.070]  It's like you've been cursed by the scorpion king.
[31:46.570 --> 31:50.130]  It's like Imhotep's mouth opened up and you're dealing with all of that shit.
[31:51.810 --> 31:53.510]  I don't know.
[31:53.810 --> 31:56.710]  If you got one fucking fly zapper in your hands, like this'll do.
[31:56.830 --> 31:58.170]  Like, no, you need seven of them.
[31:58.610 --> 31:59.270]  I don't know what you're doing.
[31:59.610 --> 32:01.050]  The wasps scared them all off.
[32:01.650 --> 32:02.690]  It's a new gang.
[32:02.830 --> 32:03.450]  They've moved in.
[32:03.810 --> 32:04.910]  They've taken away the...
[32:04.910 --> 32:05.290]  That's great.

[33:44.970 --> 33:45.810]  Oh, it's gross.
[33:46.590 --> 33:47.730]  I don't like that.
[33:47.870 --> 33:51.890]  It is gross, but what are you gonna do? They're intruding on your sovereign land.
[33:57.150 --> 34:01.950]  Well, now that the seal appears to be broken and people are traveling again,
[34:02.050 --> 34:03.150]  where are you gonna go this summer?
[34:03.290 --> 34:05.710]  I have got a few trips planned.
[34:06.490 --> 34:07.590]  Gonna go to Vegas.
[34:08.170 --> 34:10.350]  Might try to hit the beach at some point.
[34:11.070 --> 34:13.350]  And I'm gonna be taking my Raycons with me.
[34:13.350 --> 34:18.490]  And whether you're about to head for a cross-country trip to the Grand Canyon,
[34:19.090 --> 34:21.650]  or maybe you're about to... maybe you're a deep sea diver
[34:21.650 --> 34:24.430]  and you're about to fly all the way across the world to Australia
[34:24.430 --> 34:25.570]  to go to the Great Barrier Reef,
[34:25.870 --> 34:29.810]  a pair of wireless earbuds in your ears will make all the difference.
[34:29.870 --> 34:30.830]  Maybe not when you're underwater.
[34:30.950 --> 34:33.270]  I have no idea how that works with pressurization and stuff,
[34:33.350 --> 34:35.510]  but certainly when you're on the plane when you're traveling.
[34:35.810 --> 34:38.250]  And they're great because you get crisp, powerful beats
[34:38.250 --> 34:41.590]  at half the price of the other premium audio brands.
[34:41.590 --> 34:45.430]  And I know how important the beats are to all of us.
[34:45.570 --> 34:48.930]  I don't want... I don't want my non-crisp...
[34:48.930 --> 34:51.190]  I don't want my soft, crunchy...
[34:51.970 --> 34:53.250]  Well, crunchy is the opposite of soft.
[34:53.310 --> 34:53.930]  But you know what I mean.
[34:53.950 --> 34:56.090]  I don't want my buzzy beats.
[34:56.310 --> 34:57.770]  I want my crisp, clean beats.
[34:58.130 --> 34:59.250]  And Raycons look great.
[34:59.350 --> 35:00.330]  And they feel great.
[35:00.590 --> 35:01.070]  It's true.
[35:01.290 --> 35:02.710]  They come in a range of cool colors,
[35:02.950 --> 35:05.770]  depending on your idea of what is or is not cool.
[35:05.870 --> 35:06.770]  I'm not the arbiter of cool.
[35:06.850 --> 35:08.210]  Certainly, I think the colors are cool.
[35:08.450 --> 35:10.310]  I suspect you will as well.
[35:10.310 --> 35:13.630]  And with customizable gel tips that are included,
[35:14.370 --> 35:15.590]  for a comfortable in-ear fit.
[35:16.070 --> 35:17.710]  And Raycons are built for wherever you go.
[35:17.850 --> 35:18.570]  We talked about that.
[35:18.630 --> 35:20.630]  Whether it's the Grand Canyon or the Great Barrier Reef,
[35:20.770 --> 35:22.910]  they have quick, seamless Bluetooth pairing
[35:22.910 --> 35:24.670]  and a compact charging case.
[35:25.010 --> 35:27.190]  So you don't have to carry around a bunch of heavy...
[35:27.190 --> 35:28.370]  Like you don't have to carry around a...
[35:28.370 --> 35:29.750]  like a electric generator,
[35:29.930 --> 35:31.350]  like you would have outside of your house, maybe.
[35:31.730 --> 35:33.390]  Or do you remember those old bricks
[35:33.390 --> 35:35.230]  in the first generation of cell phones?
[35:35.510 --> 35:37.430]  That they were... they were like the size of a suitcase
[35:37.430 --> 35:39.630]  and you could charge your phone one half times on it.
[35:39.630 --> 35:41.350]  Yeah, you don't have to carry any of that around with you.
[35:41.650 --> 35:42.330]  So listen up.
[35:42.730 --> 35:45.510]  Raycon's offering 15% off of all their products

[36:06.410 --> 36:07.490]  and you're doing what you love.
[36:07.530 --> 36:08.150]  Hey, congratulations.
[36:08.410 --> 36:09.550]  I did that a couple years ago.
[36:09.550 --> 36:10.770]  It worked out great.
[36:11.210 --> 36:12.750]  And now you're selling products people want
[36:12.750 --> 36:14.310]  and your orders are coming in fast.
[36:14.750 --> 36:16.470]  And now comes the hard part.
[36:16.730 --> 36:18.730]  And I experienced this firsthand
[36:18.730 --> 36:22.310]  way back in the old days of the early 2000s.
[36:22.930 --> 36:25.090]  How do you ship the damn things out?
[36:25.350 --> 36:27.430]  Well, luckily, ShipStation makes it easy.

[36:58.630 --> 36:59.670]  no matter where you're selling,
[36:59.810 --> 37:01.150]  whether it's Amazon or Etsy
[37:01.150 --> 37:03.270]  or, you know, hopefully your own website
[37:03.270 --> 37:04.570]  so you can cut out the middleman.

[38:02.810 --> 38:05.050]  Oh, you know what could go well
[38:05.050 --> 38:06.010]  with your lunch, Gavin?
[38:06.010 --> 38:07.510]  What's always a nice addition
[38:07.510 --> 38:08.490]  to a great meal.
[38:08.690 --> 38:09.910]  You never go wrong
[38:09.910 --> 38:11.610]  with a little bit of nugget sauce.
[38:11.730 --> 38:12.950]  A little bit of BTS sauce.
[38:13.050 --> 38:14.370]  Doesn't even need to be nuggets.
[38:14.850 --> 38:15.610]  Wide variety.
[38:16.270 --> 38:18.450]  The sauce empire has continued to grow.
[38:18.850 --> 38:21.170]  Yeah, how is the sauce market right now?
[38:21.310 --> 38:21.970]  This is, uh...
[38:21.970 --> 38:22.650]  I gotta...
[38:22.650 --> 38:24.090]  The sauce market is booming.
[38:24.090 --> 38:25.750]  I hear it's the new GameStop, right?
[38:25.870 --> 38:27.350]  It is. It is the new GameStop.
[38:27.610 --> 38:29.570]  Just wait until they're not available anymore.
[38:29.690 --> 38:30.870]  You sent me an article about
[38:30.870 --> 38:33.430]  a huge brawl that took place over the phone.
[38:33.650 --> 38:33.670]  Yeah.
[38:34.630 --> 38:36.450]  There's apparently in Indonesia,
[38:36.630 --> 38:38.830]  like, this giant fight over the sauce.
[38:39.230 --> 38:41.150]  And the restaurants then banned people
[38:41.150 --> 38:42.410]  from going into it.
[38:42.470 --> 38:44.630]  So you could only get it via delivery order.
[38:45.110 --> 38:46.690]  And so then it was just delivery drivers.
[38:46.850 --> 38:48.430]  Like, everybody was a fucking king
[38:48.430 --> 38:49.850]  sending their knights out
[38:49.850 --> 38:51.150]  to get their BTS sauce.
[38:51.570 --> 38:52.310]  It was mayhem.
[38:52.770 --> 38:53.370]  And it's been great.
[38:53.450 --> 38:55.390]  I like that the story about the sauce is out now
[38:55.390 --> 38:57.150]  because I will get things in my Twitter feed
[38:57.150 --> 39:00.810]  of, like, BTS number one on Spotify or whatever.
[39:00.990 --> 39:02.450]  And they're so far ahead
[39:02.450 --> 39:04.850]  that if you combine the other people's
[39:04.850 --> 39:07.130]  listen or whatever, whatever viewership,
[39:07.550 --> 39:09.330]  it would be less than what BTS has.
[39:09.630 --> 39:10.950]  And I just keep wanting to say,
[39:11.010 --> 39:11.570]  good for business.
[39:11.690 --> 39:12.530]  This is good for business.
[39:12.550 --> 39:14.290]  But nobody would have had any context
[39:14.290 --> 39:15.850]  that I'm in the sauce game,
[39:15.910 --> 39:16.790]  that I'm tied to BTS.
[39:17.130 --> 39:17.870]  They're booming.
[39:18.330 --> 39:19.030]  They're doing great.
[39:19.150 --> 39:22.510]  It goes away three days from now on the 20th.
[39:22.870 --> 39:23.530]  But I feel good.
[39:23.610 --> 39:25.410]  I feel healthy with my sauce thing.
[39:25.450 --> 39:29.510]  I'll send you a photo of where I'm at.
[39:29.670 --> 39:31.730]  So yeah, I kind of went back and forth
[39:31.730 --> 39:34.710]  trying to decide what exactly I wanted
[39:34.710 --> 39:36.190]  as far as the sauce goes.
[39:36.710 --> 39:38.450]  I thought, do I go 500?
[39:38.590 --> 39:39.130]  Where do I go?
[39:39.510 --> 39:41.790]  I ultimately, I'm not, this isn't,
[39:41.910 --> 39:43.550]  you know, I'm not a dictator of sauce.
[39:43.670 --> 39:45.110]  I want everybody to experience it.
[39:45.150 --> 39:46.450]  I want the joy, some stopping.
[39:46.810 --> 39:48.390]  I don't want to buy all of it.
[39:48.490 --> 39:51.010]  This is, this is the final sauce tower
[39:51.010 --> 39:51.650]  that I built.
[39:52.450 --> 39:55.070]  You're looking at 405 sauce containers.
[39:55.510 --> 39:56.450]  It's still up.
[39:56.590 --> 39:58.310]  I'm terrified it's going to fall over
[39:58.310 --> 39:59.110]  at any minute.
[39:59.110 --> 40:00.310]  Oh my God.
[40:02.130 --> 40:04.530]  It looks like gold in Fort Knox.
[40:05.670 --> 40:06.550]  Oh my.
[40:06.890 --> 40:08.170]  Speaking of breaking bad,
[40:08.230 --> 40:09.810]  it reminds me of the money pile
[40:09.810 --> 40:11.350]  that Huel lays on.
[40:11.490 --> 40:12.530]  Oh, we've got to do that.
[40:12.690 --> 40:14.430]  We've got to take a picture of you
[40:14.430 --> 40:15.610]  lying on it on your back.
[40:15.750 --> 40:17.810]  I can't, the sauce is going to just
[40:17.810 --> 40:19.630]  fucking destroy the product.
[40:20.550 --> 40:21.870]  But that's what it resembles.
[40:22.130 --> 40:22.810]  You've got to, yeah,
[40:22.870 --> 40:24.270]  you've got to take a dive into it.
[40:24.290 --> 40:25.970]  I can't fall into it.
[40:27.310 --> 40:28.110]  Oh, Andrew.
[40:29.330 --> 40:30.550]  If you buy all this,
[40:30.710 --> 40:31.730]  maybe we'll talk about it.
[40:31.770 --> 40:32.450]  It's great sauce.
[40:32.570 --> 40:33.990]  I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
[40:34.030 --> 40:35.210]  But yeah, I have four,
[40:35.370 --> 40:36.730]  that's 405 containers.
[40:37.110 --> 40:38.310]  It took me like an hour
[40:38.310 --> 40:39.490]  to build that last night.
[40:39.610 --> 40:40.790]  I was sweating about it.
[40:40.850 --> 40:42.330]  I was so nervous it would fall.
[40:42.750 --> 40:44.330]  It's stressful building these sauces.
[40:44.730 --> 40:45.350]  As I said before,
[40:45.370 --> 40:46.950]  it's like a survivor immunity challenge.
[40:47.030 --> 40:48.070]  You've got to stack it.
[40:48.150 --> 40:48.790]  They're not stable.
[40:49.510 --> 40:50.550]  Oh, I'm going to need some,
[40:50.590 --> 40:51.790]  some sort of fan art of you
[40:51.790 --> 40:54.870]  lying on the big, big fucking saucer.
[40:56.590 --> 40:58.510]  So, are you done collecting sauce?
[40:58.650 --> 40:59.810]  I'm done collecting sauce.
[40:59.950 --> 41:00.810]  OK, this is it.
[41:00.890 --> 41:02.910]  This is your sauce stockpile.
[41:03.210 --> 41:05.670]  I got, OK, so that's a pile of 405
[41:05.670 --> 41:08.630]  and it's rows of 45 and I have nine rows.
[41:08.810 --> 41:11.150]  So part of me wants to buy one more row.
[41:11.270 --> 41:12.590]  So it's a nice even 450.
[41:12.990 --> 41:14.090]  Yeah, why did you stop
[41:14.530 --> 41:15.830]  days before the end, though?
[41:15.930 --> 41:17.390]  Like, don't you want to get...
[41:17.390 --> 41:18.410]  Well, this is, yeah, well,
[41:18.470 --> 41:20.050]  I want some people to get the sauce.
[41:20.190 --> 41:21.790]  I don't want to own all the sauce
[41:21.790 --> 41:22.690]  from that place.
[41:22.770 --> 41:24.350]  I want other people to be able to try it.
[41:24.390 --> 41:24.970]  I don't want to, like,
[41:24.970 --> 41:27.650]  Ah, you're a drug dealer.
[41:27.890 --> 41:28.730]  You want them to get
[41:28.730 --> 41:30.330]  that first taste for free.
[41:30.470 --> 41:32.430]  So then two days from now,
[41:32.530 --> 41:33.770]  when they get the craving...
[41:34.570 --> 41:37.270]  I started this asking what a BTS is
[41:37.270 --> 41:38.950]  and there are people that love them
[41:38.950 --> 41:40.130]  and I'd like for them to be able
[41:40.130 --> 41:41.710]  to try the sauce if they want to.
[41:41.790 --> 41:43.770]  I don't want to own all the sauces.
[41:43.970 --> 41:44.390]  Well, they can try.
[41:44.490 --> 41:45.750]  They just got to come through you first.
[41:46.770 --> 41:49.170]  You know, pay a finder's fee.
[41:49.550 --> 41:51.810]  But I want it was important about this
[41:51.810 --> 41:53.070]  is Nick is back.
[41:53.170 --> 41:54.170]  Nick's been away for a while.
[41:54.170 --> 41:57.010]  Nick is the sauce guy,
[41:57.130 --> 41:59.170]  I'd say, of Rooster Teeth.
[41:59.290 --> 42:00.650]  I feel like he's the sauce king.
[42:00.950 --> 42:02.010]  He's the sauce monkey.
[42:02.690 --> 42:05.030]  People were implying that we need to fight
[42:05.030 --> 42:06.810]  or that there'd be some sort of sauce war.
[42:07.330 --> 42:08.370]  So I felt it was important
[42:08.370 --> 42:10.570]  to get approval from Nick.
[42:11.090 --> 42:12.810]  Nick, how do you feel about this sauce situation?
[42:13.170 --> 42:13.990]  I'm proud of you, Andrew.
[42:14.390 --> 42:14.670]  I'm proud.
[42:14.750 --> 42:15.450]  You're proud? Okay.
[42:15.630 --> 42:16.870]  Very, very proud of you.
[42:17.290 --> 42:17.730]  I approve.
[42:18.050 --> 42:19.170]  And if you have any extras,
[42:19.410 --> 42:20.530]  you can send them here too.
[42:20.830 --> 42:21.150]  Okay.
[42:21.450 --> 42:21.870]  Well, I'm not...
[42:21.870 --> 42:22.670]  Listen, I'm not going to go
[42:22.670 --> 42:23.530]  on any of your corners.
[42:23.530 --> 42:25.330]  I'm going to pick my own corners.
[42:25.370 --> 42:26.810]  I'll be respectful of your space.
[42:27.930 --> 42:30.270]  I just wanted to make sure that we're good.
[42:30.690 --> 42:32.310]  We got a good sauce alliance going.
[42:32.790 --> 42:33.330]  Sauce alliance.
[42:33.770 --> 42:34.450]  Still alive.
[42:34.790 --> 42:35.110]  Yes.
[42:35.570 --> 42:36.810]  That is my sauce update.
[42:36.890 --> 42:37.710]  I don't think I'll get more.
[42:38.090 --> 42:39.410]  They were selling for like $10
[42:39.790 --> 42:41.050]  for one of each before.
[42:41.150 --> 42:41.890]  We'll see what happens.
[42:42.250 --> 42:43.910]  June 21st when they go away.
[42:44.390 --> 42:46.070]  I'm kind of tempted to tweet McDonald's
[42:46.070 --> 42:47.050]  to try to sell back to them.
[42:47.170 --> 42:48.370]  They're not going to have any of the sauce either.
[42:48.590 --> 42:50.930]  My next editing experiment
[42:51.330 --> 42:54.090]  is going to be taking clips from Breaking Bad.
[42:54.250 --> 42:55.490]  But on all the close-ups of meth,
[42:55.570 --> 42:57.410]  I'm going to cut in close-ups of
[42:57.410 --> 42:59.050]  dipping nugs in sauce.
[42:59.390 --> 43:00.590]  We need to talk about your edit.
[43:00.970 --> 43:02.570]  Emily was listening to the episode last night
[43:02.570 --> 43:04.410]  and she was saying that we need an episode.
[43:04.830 --> 43:06.670]  We just need to make a super cut of Andrew
[43:06.670 --> 43:08.130]  saying I'm a blank guy.
[43:08.530 --> 43:09.630]  Like, I'm a sauce guy.
[43:10.070 --> 43:11.950]  She said there's got to be 30 seconds
[43:11.950 --> 43:14.770]  of just Andrew saying I'm a pickle guy.
[43:15.050 --> 43:15.910]  Yeah, he's a blank guy
[43:15.910 --> 43:16.930]  and he's not a blank guy.
[43:17.010 --> 43:17.970]  There's like two lists
[43:17.970 --> 43:19.270]  that are very long at this point.
[43:19.830 --> 43:20.230]  Absolutely.
[43:20.990 --> 43:22.650]  We need to talk about Gavin's edit.
[43:23.070 --> 43:24.170]  Are we going to post that?
[43:24.250 --> 43:25.290]  Can we post that anywhere?
[43:25.430 --> 43:25.890]  It was fantastic.
[43:25.930 --> 43:27.270]  I assume it's all kinds of
[43:27.270 --> 43:28.070]  copyright issues with that.
[43:28.130 --> 43:32.150]  But I cut in Andrew's soda chug noises
[43:32.730 --> 43:35.350]  over the velociraptor in Jurassic Park.
[43:35.550 --> 43:37.230]  Let me see if there's...
[43:37.230 --> 43:38.270]  make sure we can post that
[43:38.270 --> 43:39.470]  because we should post it.
[43:39.490 --> 43:40.850]  We should. Well, I will say
[43:41.350 --> 43:43.770]  I uploaded it privately on YouTube.
[43:44.070 --> 43:45.310]  Just to have for myself.
[43:45.690 --> 43:48.450]  And they did not flag any copyright.
[43:48.630 --> 43:49.030]  They're like, yeah,
[43:49.050 --> 43:50.330]  no copyright material here.
[43:50.330 --> 43:51.610]  And I was like, that's wild.
[43:51.950 --> 43:52.950]  I mean, it's parody.
[43:53.330 --> 43:54.230]  It's a derivative.
[43:54.430 --> 43:55.790]  Yeah, it's great.
[43:56.070 --> 43:56.970]  I wish I had the link up.
[43:57.010 --> 43:58.290]  I'd put it in so Nick could watch it.
[43:58.350 --> 43:59.170]  It's fantastic.
[43:59.330 --> 44:00.650]  My burp, the chug,
[44:00.870 --> 44:03.350]  the chug went wrong last time I did it.
[44:03.910 --> 44:05.430]  There are some mistakes made.
[44:05.610 --> 44:07.150]  I went, I went into the lab.
[44:07.230 --> 44:07.830]  I thought about it.
[44:07.890 --> 44:08.730]  I'm not a canned guy.
[44:08.910 --> 44:09.870]  Add that to the edit.
[44:10.090 --> 44:11.190]  Not a big canned person.
[44:11.290 --> 44:13.130]  I'm not usually drinking out of cans.
[44:13.850 --> 44:15.170]  I'm from having a soda.
[44:15.350 --> 44:16.830]  It's generally in a bottle or a cup.
[44:17.410 --> 44:18.510]  I think that was a mistake.
[44:18.570 --> 44:19.610]  Also, I don't regularly
[44:19.610 --> 44:20.630]  drink 7-Up.
[44:20.730 --> 44:21.970]  Not a big 7-Up drinker.
[44:22.030 --> 44:22.950]  So it's out of my element.
[44:23.550 --> 44:26.610]  Like Nick said, I was crying laughing while editing that ending.
[44:28.130 --> 44:32.630]  It was so funny because Geoff and I only heard it through the weird sort of like
[44:32.630 --> 44:35.690]  half cut off audio that comes through Discord.
[44:35.970 --> 44:38.750]  Yeah, it's like, it's always got that like gate on it.
[44:39.270 --> 44:40.150]  So that was fun.
[44:40.190 --> 44:41.690]  That was like funny enough to make me cry.
[44:41.850 --> 44:44.010]  Going into your raw audio and listen to it.
[44:44.510 --> 44:45.270]  I'll be honest.
[44:45.330 --> 44:47.650]  I must have listened to it 20 times.
[44:48.210 --> 44:52.110]  Especially the one where it just sounds like you're kind of underwater, but it's all foam.
[44:52.550 --> 44:56.010]  The second time you try it, it's like...
[44:56.650 --> 44:57.970]  It's just all frothy.
[44:59.870 --> 45:02.270]  It was a nightmare to live through.
[45:02.390 --> 45:04.210]  I'm glad it brought you joy.
[45:04.690 --> 45:06.750]  So your theory is that...
[45:06.750 --> 45:09.090]  Well, you have a theory about the receptacle.
[45:09.430 --> 45:09.990]  I do, yeah.
[45:10.050 --> 45:11.930]  It's all about, see, I'm more of a bottle person.
[45:12.050 --> 45:13.950]  I think for several reasons.
[45:14.110 --> 45:15.670]  One, easier to control the chug.
[45:15.670 --> 45:17.630]  Tough to control a canned chug.
[45:18.470 --> 45:22.110]  Secondly, there's a visual progress bar that I would get while chugging.
[45:22.410 --> 45:23.710]  Mentally get me the rest of the way.
[45:23.770 --> 45:24.570]  I know how much is left.
[45:24.650 --> 45:25.550]  I know how much is going.
[45:25.870 --> 45:27.790]  You can feel that though, in the weight.
[45:27.990 --> 45:29.030]  Don't you think that would work against you?
[45:29.410 --> 45:29.730]  What?
[45:29.850 --> 45:31.170]  Being able to see how much I've left?
[45:31.230 --> 45:33.690]  Yeah, like if you're not making progress, like you feel like you deserve it.
[45:33.690 --> 45:34.150]  Oh, no.
[45:34.370 --> 45:35.530]  No, I'm a sprinter, Geoff.
[45:35.570 --> 45:37.390]  So I'm going to make a lot of progress at the beginning.
[45:37.490 --> 45:41.010]  And then when I struggle in the middle, I'll be like, I'm almost there.
[45:41.110 --> 45:41.430]  I got it.
[45:41.470 --> 45:42.710]  It's also bigger than a can.
[45:43.090 --> 45:43.810]  That's the thing to remember.
[45:43.810 --> 45:46.010]  I think the cans are 335 milliliters.
[45:46.650 --> 45:47.290]  Bottle 500.
[45:47.710 --> 45:49.650]  Wait, you're still going to try with two, though?
[45:50.350 --> 45:50.670]  355.
[45:50.990 --> 45:51.310]  355.
[45:51.330 --> 45:52.710]  Oh, no, I'm not going to try three bottles.
[45:52.790 --> 45:53.430]  That's absurd.
[45:53.550 --> 45:54.630]  That's more than I said before.
[45:55.070 --> 45:56.190]  It'd be one and a half.
[45:56.550 --> 45:57.150]  It was two cans.
[45:57.150 --> 45:57.790]  It'd be one and a half bottles, right?
[45:58.390 --> 45:58.910]  No, I didn't.
[45:59.370 --> 46:00.930]  I said I could do three cans.
[46:01.050 --> 46:03.090]  I failed at doing one can three times.
[46:03.130 --> 46:04.010]  That's when I knew it was happening.
[46:06.090 --> 46:07.290]  But I have bottles.
[46:07.350 --> 46:07.910]  I'm ready to try.
[46:07.970 --> 46:10.030]  I also have salad as well.
[46:10.090 --> 46:10.830]  I have a salad.
[46:11.390 --> 46:12.090]  What do I do first?
[46:12.090 --> 46:14.050]  I certainly do the soda first, right?
[46:14.910 --> 46:16.750]  First off, can I say, I think we need to...
[46:16.750 --> 46:18.590]  I think this is the great way to end the show.
[46:19.030 --> 46:20.870]  I think we do the salad, then the soda.
[46:21.410 --> 46:22.550]  But I have a...
[46:22.550 --> 46:23.290]  That seems dangerous.
[46:23.770 --> 46:24.690]  Do I have a quick...
[46:24.690 --> 46:27.730]  I have a quick piece of business I'd like to run by you guys real fast.
[46:28.070 --> 46:28.230]  Okay.
[46:28.370 --> 46:28.750]  Let me...
[46:28.750 --> 46:29.690]  I'm going to throw this in the Discord.
[46:30.290 --> 46:32.090]  You see what I'm holding in my hand?
[46:32.430 --> 46:33.710]  Oh, that's a full-size bat.
[46:34.070 --> 46:34.450]  Oh, wow.
[46:34.450 --> 46:36.910]  Yeah, so I don't know if you guys remember a while back,
[46:37.010 --> 46:39.790]  but we had a whole thing with baseball bats and then bat knobs.
[46:39.790 --> 46:41.370]  And then there was... we had a plan.
[46:41.570 --> 46:43.490]  And then you guys confused the plan out of me.
[46:43.610 --> 46:44.430]  And I don't know.
[46:44.690 --> 46:45.950]  So anyway, here's what happened.
[46:47.410 --> 46:50.210]  Yesterday, a hundred of those showed up at my house.
[46:50.610 --> 46:50.830]  Wow.
[46:52.030 --> 46:53.270]  One baseball bat.
[46:53.530 --> 46:54.830]  One full-size baseball bat.
[46:54.930 --> 46:56.010]  That's a lot of baseball bat.
[46:56.290 --> 46:58.730]  A hundred baseball bats is half my house.
[46:59.190 --> 47:01.570]  Half of my house's box is a baseball bat.
[47:01.590 --> 47:02.290]  I wasn't here.
[47:02.330 --> 47:02.890]  Are you a gang from the Warriors?
[47:02.890 --> 47:03.370]  I wasn't here.
[47:03.430 --> 47:04.050]  What are you doing?
[47:04.290 --> 47:05.810]  Emily and Millie had to bring it in.
[47:05.870 --> 47:06.810]  They were not happy, apparently.
[47:07.050 --> 47:07.750]  I was...
[47:08.270 --> 47:09.010]  I was...
[47:09.010 --> 47:09.590]  I wasn't around.
[47:09.590 --> 47:15.750]  So I got boxes and boxes and boxes of very heavy baseball bats.
[47:15.870 --> 47:18.930]  I don't remember what the fuck I'm supposed to do with them.
[47:19.390 --> 47:22.550]  Vaguely, I thought maybe I'm supposed to cut the knobs off, right?
[47:22.890 --> 47:24.690]  Like, and it was going to be like that was part of it.
[47:25.030 --> 47:26.030]  But here's my question.
[47:26.790 --> 47:29.430]  Here's the knob on the baseball bat.
[47:29.610 --> 47:34.690]  If I cut that off of the baseball bat, it's just a fucking knob that doesn't say...
[47:34.690 --> 47:36.290]  that doesn't say f*** face on it anywhere.
[47:36.610 --> 47:38.190]  Shouldn't it say f*** face on it?
[47:38.190 --> 47:39.390]  Now, we've had this talk.
[47:39.530 --> 47:41.130]  I don't understand why this is confusing.
[47:41.330 --> 47:42.710]  Yeah, you're supposed to...
[47:42.710 --> 47:45.770]  Yeah, so if we have bats, the thing with the bats was...
[47:45.770 --> 47:48.150]  and we decided not to do this, but hey, they're here.
[47:48.450 --> 47:52.770]  You're going to cut off the ends of all of them and then imprint them in some way on the knob.
[47:52.850 --> 47:55.410]  Yeah, I was going to put like a tag or something on it.
[47:55.630 --> 47:57.230]  But shouldn't it still say f*** face?
[47:57.330 --> 48:00.130]  Like, I'm just giving somebody a knob that...
[48:00.130 --> 48:04.230]  Like, why do they put f*** face on the big part of the bat and not the knob part?
[48:04.270 --> 48:04.930]  I see what you're saying.
[48:06.070 --> 48:07.130]  Nobody's going to get...
[48:07.130 --> 48:08.510]  Yeah, that's the throwaway part.
[48:09.290 --> 48:14.630]  There's nothing identifiable about the knob in any way whatsoever.
[48:15.590 --> 48:17.710]  When is there stuff on the knob of the bat anyway?
[48:18.050 --> 48:19.810]  But the knob is what people want.
[48:20.530 --> 48:23.970]  Shouldn't the knob be stamped with f*** face in some way?
[48:24.310 --> 48:25.910]  I think it's a manual stamp job.
[48:25.990 --> 48:27.010]  Yeah, I think that's your job.
[48:27.070 --> 48:27.970]  Otherwise, what was the point of...
[48:27.970 --> 48:29.590]  What was the point of writing...
[48:29.590 --> 48:32.150]  What was the point of putting f*** face on the big part of the bat?
[48:32.270 --> 48:33.450]  It's going in a trash can.
[48:33.710 --> 48:34.290]  No, no, no.
[48:34.290 --> 48:38.970]  So remember before, Geoff, there was at one point an idea of cutting the knobs off the bat
[48:38.970 --> 48:44.090]  and selling both individually and then trying to find the bat part, your matching part.
[48:44.110 --> 48:47.990]  All I know is if I cut that knob off, that knob could be anything, man.
[48:48.310 --> 48:50.510]  Yeah, you had to engrave it. That was the main point.
[48:50.750 --> 48:55.510]  People can use it as a cabinet handle. They can use it, you know, sat on the desk.
[48:55.770 --> 48:59.230]  Just trust that it came from a bat that said f*** face at some point.
[48:59.370 --> 49:02.290]  I mean, yeah, I guess. I just feel...
[49:02.290 --> 49:05.410]  What are you going to do? Get another different hundred bats?
[49:05.750 --> 49:07.490]  Of course it's going to be those bats you got.
[49:08.070 --> 49:14.350]  Well, maybe we shouldn't cut them because it looks like it's a nice bat when it's all together.
[49:15.390 --> 49:16.410]  You want to...
[49:16.790 --> 49:17.990]  Of course it is.
[49:19.310 --> 49:20.350]  I just...
[49:20.890 --> 49:22.150]  I just don't know, man.
[49:22.710 --> 49:25.050]  Everything's nice when it's not sawn in half.
[49:27.310 --> 49:29.170]  Gavin, I keep having this problem.
[49:29.170 --> 49:35.630]  Every morning I wake up and I flip my bat knob and it keeps appearing bottom side up every day.
[49:35.670 --> 49:37.990]  I don't know what to do. I think I'm in the Matrix.
[49:38.350 --> 49:41.130]  All right, eat a salad. I'll figure it out.
[49:41.930 --> 49:43.150]  I'm not cutting...
[49:43.150 --> 49:48.290]  And by the way, if I have to cut these bat knobs, I've decided Gavin's helping.
[49:48.430 --> 49:49.490]  So thanks in advance for that.
[49:49.590 --> 49:51.930]  Just rent like a... or just go somewhere that has a band saw.
[49:52.010 --> 49:53.150]  You'll get through the wall in like an hour.
[49:53.610 --> 49:54.190]  Yeah, we will.
[49:54.730 --> 49:57.210]  Yeah, we will.
[49:57.210 --> 49:59.750]  I can't leave my house. There's wasps.
[49:59.930 --> 50:01.170]  You can't under the...
[50:01.170 --> 50:02.930]  Under the safety of Geoff.
[50:03.010 --> 50:05.710]  It's because you tried to do shit without me that caused the problem.
[50:05.790 --> 50:07.870]  You're going against the natural order of things.
[50:08.030 --> 50:09.630]  The universe is correcting you.
[50:09.850 --> 50:12.650]  It's wasps in the sun or it's Geoff in the rain.
[50:12.730 --> 50:13.810]  I've got to make my choice.
[50:15.470 --> 50:18.550]  Geoff is going to rush your house with nails through his bat,
[50:18.690 --> 50:20.690]  swinging at flies, trying to score you out.
[50:21.150 --> 50:24.570]  I don't consider the bat situation resolved.
[50:24.570 --> 50:28.110]  Well, we're putting a pin in this because I'm not cutting anything until we get it figured out.
[50:28.670 --> 50:31.530]  But I don't want to take up any more time on it other than I'm just...
[50:31.530 --> 50:35.650]  I'm just annoyed that my house is 40% bat right now.
[50:35.730 --> 50:37.050]  And I would like to get past it.
[50:38.150 --> 50:39.630]  You know where the bats came from?
[50:39.870 --> 50:40.190]  It's like...
[50:41.490 --> 50:43.050]  From a bat store, I assume.
[50:43.370 --> 50:45.970]  I just assumed it wasn't happening because we couldn't agree on anything.
[50:46.410 --> 50:47.670]  Yeah, I don't know. I forgot about it.
[50:47.750 --> 50:49.150]  You don't definitively know.
[50:49.350 --> 50:51.450]  You don't know the exact source of the bats.
[50:51.910 --> 50:54.110]  Do you want me to tell you right now?
[50:54.110 --> 50:55.590]  No, I was just curious if you knew.
[50:55.790 --> 50:56.890]  This is fascinating.
[50:58.650 --> 51:00.050]  Can't hear you, but that's fine.
[51:00.710 --> 51:03.190]  I was just wondering if, you know, they weren't tampered with.
[51:03.530 --> 51:05.590]  You know that much because Gavin and I didn't know about this.
[51:05.830 --> 51:06.650]  Fuck you.
[51:08.630 --> 51:09.510]  Fuck you.
[51:09.750 --> 51:10.950]  Eat a salad, bitch.
[51:11.270 --> 51:12.070]  Let's hear it.
[51:12.590 --> 51:12.990]  Am I eating?
[51:13.150 --> 51:14.930]  Okay, we'll do it once again.
[51:14.930 --> 51:15.770]  Why do you have a salad again?
[51:16.070 --> 51:18.610]  Because this is also under fucking protest.
[51:18.930 --> 51:21.090]  I tried to do the salad cream thing before.
[51:21.470 --> 51:23.330]  I made a great salad, I think.
[51:23.330 --> 51:25.910]  I got the best of what everybody thought should be in a salad.
[51:26.070 --> 51:27.290]  I put the cream...
[51:27.290 --> 51:28.350]  What do you want me to do?
[51:28.430 --> 51:30.530]  I don't know how I failed the salad cream thing.
[51:30.610 --> 51:31.890]  I don't know what you people want.
[51:32.270 --> 51:33.170]  What do you want from me?
[51:33.190 --> 51:36.250]  I have a thing of salad cream and I have a salad in front of me.
[51:36.610 --> 51:37.550]  What do I need to do?
[51:37.750 --> 51:38.270]  What am I doing?
[51:38.290 --> 51:39.810]  Why are you doing this again now?
[51:40.330 --> 51:44.370]  Yeah, I think what we want is an explanation as to why we're doing this.
[51:44.470 --> 51:46.810]  Because I did the bottle chug and everyone's like,
[51:46.870 --> 51:48.130]  oh, you didn't salad cream it.
[51:48.230 --> 51:50.710]  And every fuck you guys constantly saying salad creamed it.
[51:50.710 --> 51:54.150]  So I want to fucking know how, like, what was I supposed to do?
[51:54.290 --> 51:57.710]  I don't think you can escape what to salad cream something means now.
[51:57.990 --> 51:58.410]  You verbed it.
[51:58.750 --> 52:02.050]  I want to give you what you fucking want, is what I want.
[52:02.230 --> 52:02.990]  That's what I want to do.
[52:03.130 --> 52:06.270]  You can, that's fine, but it's not going to unverb that phrase.
[52:06.450 --> 52:07.450]  No, I'm fine with that.
[52:07.530 --> 52:08.830]  I'm okay with salad creaming the thing.
[52:08.930 --> 52:11.670]  I just want to, I want to give what you guys wanted.
[52:11.910 --> 52:12.210]  What you hoped for.
[52:12.210 --> 52:16.810]  He wants the term salad cream to mean, like, ultimate redemption at this point.
[52:16.830 --> 52:17.990]  He's trying to change the definition.
[52:18.490 --> 52:20.690]  I'm okay with the definition being what it is.
[52:20.690 --> 52:23.870]  I just want to try to deliver what you guys wanted.
[52:24.010 --> 52:24.770]  So explain to me.
[52:24.870 --> 52:25.590]  I have a salad.
[52:25.690 --> 52:26.850]  I have salad cream.
[52:27.350 --> 52:28.410]  What am I supposed to do?
[52:28.690 --> 52:30.670]  What are we looking at with the salad?
[52:30.770 --> 52:31.470]  Describe your salad.
[52:31.630 --> 52:35.650]  It's a, it's a chicken salad with some almonds, some bacon and strawberry.
[52:35.970 --> 52:36.590]  A little bit of cheese.
[52:39.170 --> 52:40.490]  It's still a weird salad.
[52:40.750 --> 52:41.630]  It's no, it's okay.
[52:42.010 --> 52:44.050]  Eat a fucking dick, Gavin.
[52:44.190 --> 52:46.450]  I posted it in our text chat yesterday.
[52:46.710 --> 52:48.470]  This is a regulation salad.
[52:48.650 --> 52:49.490]  I thought of that.
[52:49.490 --> 52:51.050]  I got approval by both of you.
[52:51.090 --> 52:52.310]  This is a regulation.
[52:52.570 --> 52:53.030]  He did.
[52:53.130 --> 52:54.150]  He did get approval.
[52:54.450 --> 52:55.730]  I don't remember strawberries.
[52:56.370 --> 52:57.990]  Strawberries on a regulation salad.
[52:58.110 --> 52:58.790]  You're having a laugh.
[52:58.990 --> 52:59.730]  What do you mean?
[53:00.350 --> 53:01.350]  What do you mean?
[53:01.710 --> 53:02.730]  Having a laugh.
[53:02.810 --> 53:03.250]  What the fuck?
[53:03.290 --> 53:03.970]  It's a straw.
[53:04.010 --> 53:05.050]  It's a top fruit.
[53:05.490 --> 53:06.670]  It's very common in salad.
[53:06.670 --> 53:09.510]  Yeah, but salad cream's not for fruit, Andrew.
[53:09.870 --> 53:11.010]  What do you want from me?
[53:11.030 --> 53:12.150]  You approved the salad.
[53:12.630 --> 53:13.710]  I can't help you.
[53:13.730 --> 53:16.530]  I didn't know you were doing the salad cream thing again.
[53:16.770 --> 53:17.670]  What am I supposed to do?
[53:17.750 --> 53:18.430]  Do a Caesar?
[53:18.430 --> 53:20.370]  Not put fucking Caesar dressing on it?
[53:20.430 --> 53:21.430]  What am I supposed to do?
[53:21.650 --> 53:23.970]  All you said was, what do you think of this salad?
[53:24.110 --> 53:25.150]  And you sent me a picture of it.
[53:25.170 --> 53:26.750]  I thought, that looks like a nice salad.
[53:27.050 --> 53:28.270]  I didn't know it was for salad cream.
[53:28.930 --> 53:29.630]  I got approved.
[53:29.910 --> 53:31.250]  This is a regulation salad.
[53:31.690 --> 53:34.030]  You approved it without all the information.
[53:34.610 --> 53:35.730]  I can't believe that.
[53:35.730 --> 53:36.570]  I make a salad.
[53:36.710 --> 53:37.510]  It's not good enough.
[53:37.570 --> 53:38.810]  I get approved for a salad.
[53:38.910 --> 53:39.670]  It's not good enough.
[53:39.910 --> 53:41.250]  There's no fucking winning.
[53:41.410 --> 53:43.890]  List the ingredients again or show me a picture of this damn salad.
[53:43.990 --> 53:44.190]  Let me have a look.
[53:44.730 --> 53:45.670]  List the ingredients.
[53:46.030 --> 53:47.150]  Okay, I got some...
[53:47.870 --> 53:49.330]  What kind of chicken are we talking about?
[53:49.510 --> 53:51.550]  Is it grilled or fried?
[53:51.830 --> 53:54.390]  I didn't expect this to be a fucking investigation.
[53:54.630 --> 53:55.030]  Is it blackened?
[53:55.070 --> 53:57.010]  Is it blackened, grilled or fried?
[53:57.270 --> 54:05.850]  It is a grilled chicken with almonds, some sugared almonds, some candied almonds on it.
[54:06.050 --> 54:07.110]  It's a very sweet salad.
[54:07.310 --> 54:08.910]  A cheese of some kind.
[54:08.910 --> 54:09.610]  It's a sugar salad.
[54:10.350 --> 54:11.150]  Sugar salad.
[54:11.190 --> 54:13.210]  You approved the fucking salad.
[54:13.710 --> 54:14.770]  I was trying to avoid this.
[54:17.710 --> 54:19.850]  What is a standard salad to you?
[54:20.270 --> 54:21.550]  What is just a base?
[54:21.690 --> 54:25.070]  Okay, if I'm making my salad, if I'm doing my own salad...
[54:25.070 --> 54:25.770]  Why do I ask?
[54:25.850 --> 54:26.310]  It's gonna be weird.
[54:26.310 --> 54:26.730]  What do you mean?
[54:26.910 --> 54:28.990]  I don't fucking know what you want from me.
[54:29.270 --> 54:30.450]  I'm trying to answer your questions.
[54:30.610 --> 54:32.550]  If I'm making a salad, I'm putting chicken in it.
[54:32.590 --> 54:33.730]  I'm putting some salad in it.
[54:33.930 --> 54:35.170]  I'm not putting dressing on it.
[54:35.270 --> 54:36.590]  Throw some berries in there.
[54:36.750 --> 54:37.970]  I'll put some berries in it.
[54:37.990 --> 54:39.290]  I'll put maybe some croutons.
[54:39.550 --> 54:40.490]  I don't know what you want.
[54:40.950 --> 54:42.150]  What's in your base salad?
[54:42.150 --> 54:43.410]  I'm putting chicken in it.
[54:43.490 --> 54:44.970]  I'm putting salad in it.
[54:48.130 --> 54:48.850]  Putting lettuce.
[54:50.250 --> 54:51.510]  What kind of lettuce do we do?
[54:51.590 --> 54:52.090]  What kind of lettuce?
[54:52.290 --> 54:53.530]  I, you know, it could be romaine.
[54:53.630 --> 54:54.790]  It just depends on the day.
[54:54.850 --> 54:55.810]  I'm okay with spinach.
[54:55.950 --> 54:57.450]  You can go all sorts of salads.
[54:57.590 --> 54:58.230]  I'm not that picky.
[54:58.830 --> 55:00.470]  I don't even have dressing on it, generally.
[55:00.630 --> 55:02.250]  I'm here to try to appease you guys.
[55:02.530 --> 55:03.870]  I can't go through this again.
[55:03.990 --> 55:05.030]  I'm going to just shit myself.
[55:05.330 --> 55:05.990]  I know, I know.
[55:07.650 --> 55:09.770]  You're living on borrowed time as it is, man.
[55:12.150 --> 55:13.710]  This is not how you want to go out.
[55:16.470 --> 55:18.010]  Where's this picture of the desk?
[55:18.010 --> 55:19.070]  I'm trying to find it.
[55:19.070 --> 55:19.830]  I wasn't prepared.
[55:20.190 --> 55:21.710]  I'm trying to find a photo of it.
[55:21.750 --> 55:22.890]  I wasn't ready for this.
[55:23.210 --> 55:24.210]  I did this yesterday.
[55:25.770 --> 55:27.870]  I guess I could have done that, but I don't know.
[55:28.010 --> 55:31.410]  Well, but then he's got to transfer it to the iPad and then the iPad will be out of batteries.
[55:31.510 --> 55:32.250]  It's a whole thing.
[55:32.450 --> 55:34.050]  Yeah, it's at 10% right now.
[55:34.270 --> 55:35.990]  So, okay, menu.
[55:36.750 --> 55:37.810]  Wendy, I'm on the way.
[55:37.890 --> 55:38.310]  I got this.
[55:38.330 --> 55:39.330]  I ordered this from Wendy's.
[55:39.390 --> 55:40.710]  Okay, this is a pre-made.
[55:40.710 --> 55:42.550]  I got it before we recorded.
[55:42.650 --> 55:44.790]  This is a product anyone could go out and get.
[55:46.310 --> 55:47.630]  It's very accessible.
[55:47.870 --> 55:49.150]  It's a very normal salad.
[55:50.090 --> 55:51.150]  Loading into it.
[55:51.210 --> 55:53.990]  It's called like the summer berry salad or something like that.
[55:54.070 --> 55:55.010]  Okay, I'm almost there.
[55:55.270 --> 55:57.450]  Let's go to the fresh made salad category.
[55:57.870 --> 56:00.550]  The summer berry chicken salad looks delicious.
[56:00.690 --> 56:01.270]  It looks like...
[56:01.270 --> 56:03.990]  Are you sending us a picture from the website instead of...
[56:03.990 --> 56:05.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:05.670 --> 56:07.590]  I went on their website just so you could see.
[56:07.670 --> 56:08.970]  You get what's on it.
[56:09.030 --> 56:10.070]  You get all the information.
[56:10.070 --> 56:11.390]  You could possibly want.
[56:11.630 --> 56:15.470]  We can end this ridiculous denial that this is not an appropriate salad.
[56:15.670 --> 56:17.170]  This is an absurd salad.
[56:17.710 --> 56:19.710]  You want me to move the strawberries out of the way?
[56:19.790 --> 56:21.150]  We could get the strawberries out of the way.
[56:21.150 --> 56:23.210]  I just want to see it.
[56:23.550 --> 56:24.930]  Okay, this is what it looks like.
[56:24.990 --> 56:26.370]  This is the salad right there.
[56:26.610 --> 56:27.870]  Summer berry chicken salad.
[56:28.390 --> 56:32.070]  I went on a half because I didn't, you know, I'm not sure about the salad cream.
[56:33.210 --> 56:35.130]  Yeah, I'll sign off on this.
[56:35.510 --> 56:37.090]  Yeah, you already did.
[56:37.230 --> 56:38.290]  I don't know why you're asking.
[56:38.950 --> 56:39.790]  Lettuce blend.
[56:40.390 --> 56:40.950]  Grilled chicken.
[56:41.710 --> 56:42.550]  Three cheese.
[56:43.590 --> 56:44.730]  Applewood smoked bacon.
[56:45.170 --> 56:45.590]  Strawberries.
[56:46.170 --> 56:46.590]  Asiago.
[56:46.890 --> 56:49.450]  Ginger dressing.
[56:49.970 --> 56:51.850]  Well, does it have the ginger dressing?
[56:52.010 --> 56:52.390]  No, no, no.
[56:52.770 --> 56:54.190]  Ginger dressing on the side.
[56:54.310 --> 56:54.850]  I didn't put it on.
[56:55.290 --> 56:56.830]  The dressing's got to stay away.
[56:57.110 --> 56:57.790]  Yeah, it's gone.
[56:58.270 --> 56:59.310]  It's out of sight, out of mind.
[56:59.710 --> 57:00.830]  Yeah, I decided to put it in your sauce.
[57:00.850 --> 57:04.850]  Yeah, I mean, it's ten times better than the first thing you made.
[57:04.910 --> 57:07.530]  It's a regulation salad that you agreed upon already.
[57:08.090 --> 57:10.190]  I'm just trying to figure out what you want me to do,
[57:10.270 --> 57:12.450]  because I don't understand where I went wrong the first time.
[57:12.770 --> 57:16.790]  OK, so now if you have that salad in front of you,
[57:17.070 --> 57:19.530]  I would recommend taking the salad cream.
[57:19.630 --> 57:21.410]  And Gavin, you're going to have to correct me if I'm wrong here.
[57:22.750 --> 57:26.030]  I would shake it up a little bit to make sure that it's all mixed.
[57:26.290 --> 57:28.470]  So if there's any oil that separates or whatever,
[57:28.610 --> 57:30.730]  and then I would squirt a healthy...
[57:31.570 --> 57:35.550]  I don't know what your deal is if you're a clockwise or a counterclockwise kind of guy,
[57:35.610 --> 57:36.710]  but I'd give it a full...
[57:36.710 --> 57:38.530]  Don't I need to try the salad first?
[57:38.710 --> 57:41.450]  Wasn't this part of the whole thing is I put the cream on immediately
[57:41.450 --> 57:44.170]  and you guys are like, ah, you didn't try the salad first.
[57:44.530 --> 57:47.330]  Well, I mean, if you're trying salad cream for the first time, yeah.
[57:47.770 --> 57:51.370]  Yeah, right now you've already tried it and you're just eating salad.
[57:52.030 --> 57:52.910]  Yeah, I don't know.
[57:52.970 --> 57:55.490]  But you were like the salad. You tried the salad without...
[57:55.490 --> 57:57.850]  Yeah, give it a base. Give it a base side test.
[57:57.890 --> 58:00.050]  Give it some proper benchmarking.
[58:00.770 --> 58:02.510]  Get a bite.
[58:02.930 --> 58:05.650]  Get a bite that has chicken, at least one piece of chicken,
[58:06.470 --> 58:09.390]  strawberries. Yeah, try to incorporate all the elements into one bite.
[58:10.530 --> 58:12.250]  Okay, I have a good salad.
[58:12.630 --> 58:14.590]  All right, on a scale of one to ten, what do you give it?
[58:14.970 --> 58:15.990]  On the salad scale?
[58:16.330 --> 58:16.530]  Yeah.
[58:16.770 --> 58:18.150]  Like a 7.5.
[58:18.290 --> 58:18.810]  7.5.
[58:18.810 --> 58:23.170]  This is all right. It's a 7.5 in its raw, natural form.
[58:23.650 --> 58:24.370]  Pretty good score.
[58:24.950 --> 58:27.390]  That's a pretty good score. It sounds like that's a...
[58:27.390 --> 58:27.530]  Not bad.
[58:28.450 --> 58:33.850]  You know, you ain't failing that great if that's what your report card says.
[58:33.850 --> 58:39.210]  Okay, I guess now, Gav, you want to... he should incorporate the salad cream, right?
[58:39.590 --> 58:45.970]  Yeah, yeah. Give it a nice long squeeze on it. A nice orbit of the salad. Maybe give it a little
[58:45.970 --> 58:49.630]  mix. Really make sure it's all over everything that you're going to eat.
[58:50.150 --> 58:52.010]  Yeah, you definitely want to mix it up.
[58:52.150 --> 58:54.370]  Yeah, we're mixing. We're mixing. We're mixing the thing.
[58:55.110 --> 58:58.230]  Get a little bacon. A little bit of... get a strawberry on there.
[58:58.690 --> 59:01.810]  A little flavor. A little bit more cheese.
[59:01.910 --> 59:03.110]  Okay, here we go. We're going to take a second bite.
[59:03.110 --> 59:04.870]  He puts it on fruit and meat.
[59:04.870 --> 59:10.990]  I don't... what am I supposed to do with it? It's salad cream. It's not fruit cream.
[59:11.390 --> 59:16.790]  Not salad fruit cream. Okay, I'm going for a bite. This is okay.
[59:17.310 --> 59:20.350]  I love the idea of a sauce being sold based on what you shouldn't put it on.
[59:25.620 --> 59:29.260]  You know what? 7.7. 7.7.
[59:29.940 --> 59:30.500]  Improved?
[59:30.760 --> 59:33.360]  Improved. Salad cream with fruit. Pretty good.
[59:33.700 --> 59:35.180]  Wow. Okay.
[59:35.720 --> 59:41.180]  So it went up. It went up two tenths of a point. So what you're saying is if you were to use salad
[59:41.180 --> 59:44.060]  cream, you can expect to improve the average salad by 0.2%.
[59:44.060 --> 59:50.300]  On this salad with the bacon and the chicken, there's kind of some saltiness to the chicken
[59:50.300 --> 59:55.900]  and then the sweetness of the fruit. It really contrasts well with the kind of
[59:56.460 --> 59:58.800]  creaminess of the salad cream. I'd recommend.
[59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.600]  So it sort of pulls it all together.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.900]  It kind of, yeah, unites it, creates it, adds to it without subtracting from the flavor elements
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.840]  of the previous fork without the cream.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.320]  So if they just renamed it fruit cream or meat cream, would you?
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.360]  Would you buy that?
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.980]  I would recommend it on most fruits or creams.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.640]  Yeah, that's the scenario.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.360]  You'd recommend it on cream?
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:25.060]  I would. Yes, I would. That is what I said. That is exactly what I meant.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.980]  That was not a misspoke.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.080]  I choose my words very deliberately.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.020]  Yeah, yeah. So is that good? Are we good?
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.460]  Has the salad cream, have I got salad cream redemption?
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.540]  I kind of want this year, year two of F*** Face to be my redemption year.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.460]  Oh, interesting.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.300]  A big redemption tour.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.040]  Yeah, I'm on my, I won the bet. I won the outskirts bet.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.280]  I'm going to try to do a little bit more winning this year and a little bit of redemption of things
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.640]  I f***ed up in the first year. Get better.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.000]  Well, Gav, how do you feel about that? Are you satisfied with his salad creaming?
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.960]  Well, yeah, sure.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.340]  That's what you wanted. I don't know if you don't like it. That's on you.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.840]  That's what you wanted. I gave you what you wanted.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.020]  I think it was better last time I did it, but that was apparently no good.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.120]  So I gave you what I wanted. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you like that.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.340]  I gave you what I wanted.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.040]  I gave you what you asked for.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.680]  Oh yeah, I mean, it was, it was, you know, it was just...
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.680]  It was exactly what you wanted. I don't know what you want.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.560]  I don't know what you want. I gave you what you wanted.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.640]  I think the first time was better. Both good.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.000]  It's as if, like, imagine I rented a suit for a wedding, right?
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:42.200]  But you gave me a suit that had a shit stain down the front of it, right?
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.300]  I had to wear that to the wedding.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.460]  Three months after the wedding, you give me a perfectly clean suit.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.140]  I don't, what do I want it now for?
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.940]  Well, because you complained about it. And it's not just that,
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.920]  it's you preferred the shit stain suit is really where my issue is.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.320]  Ultimately, I think you should have recognized that what I had before was good.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.160]  It was a good thing. It was great. The salad, the second salad cream,
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.360]  I think is worse than the first. And that was my point.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.400]  How good the first one was. You did it again, but shit.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:16.980]  Yeah, no, I wanted to show you that what you wanted actually wasn't better than what we had.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.720]  That was the whole point of that exercise. The first salad cream.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.240]  The least satisfying redemption possible.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.120]  No, I feel very redeemed. You see that what you wanted was wrong.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.320]  You don't do it better. You just prove that it wasn't as good as the one.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.820]  No, I did it the way you wanted it fucking done.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.220]  That was the point of that. I gave you what you wanted and it was like I thought.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.600]  The whole point was it was the first time you were trying it.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.120]  That was the excitement for me. You've already had the damn stuff.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.380]  It's been sat in your cupboard for months. I forgot what it tasted like.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.200]  I bought a new bottle. That was exciting. This one was glass.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.380]  Maybe there's a different flavor for it. What happened to the other one?
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.620]  I lost it. I don't know. It's not. I don't have it anymore.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.040]  I had to get a new one.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.860]  Have you lost your Branston as well?
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.900]  Oh, the brand. I just threw that away. I didn't.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.900]  It's so expensive to buy it. That was like four bucks.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.020]  That's four. It's nothing. What a waste.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.020]  You need to invest that in the BTS sauce game.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:26.280]  Oh, so I think I proved my point. I think the salad cream 1.0 is great.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.080]  I think that's fantastic. And I think the only way to top it off,
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.280]  you have a salad. It's, you know, it's you got sauce.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.780]  A little bit of soda redemption. I think I've thought about it. I put strategy in.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.760]  I was going to bring a puke bucket. I forgot it.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.020]  I don't need it because I'm confident in the fact that this one is going to go way better.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:46.020]  I'm going to actually even swap out. I'm going to swap out the cokes.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.040]  So your problem last time was that you kept burping while drinking.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.620]  You just have to hold it in. Well, my problem was my body
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:59.580]  rejected the Pepsi almost immediately and then everything exploded. So we're doing coke.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:04.360]  I told Andrew that that was my favorite line for that episode. My body rejects the Pepsi.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.520]  Okay, we have we have a new problem. I have a problem. One second.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.880]  It's not a twist up. No, it's not.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.080]  No, my problem. Okay, what's what is going? What is happening? I have my mic.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.360]  I have my mic attached to my end table. And in the slight moving that I've done,
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:30.800]  it is now heavier than the table itself. And if I let go of the mic, the whole thing begins to fall.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.260]  The whole table. Yeah, I'm going to release. I'm going to we're going to release. I'm going
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.380]  to catch it so it doesn't hit the ground. Let's see if it's fixed.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.340]  Oh, don't worry, Nick. We're going to we're going to end it sooner.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.280]  Sooner or later, buddy. Oh, it's fucking.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.320]  How is your microphone heavier than your table?
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:58.700]  Okay, well, maybe it was on like something. I don't know. We're good. Okay.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.640]  Weigh it down with sauce.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:09.380]  I'm opening, opening the soda. Oh, so 30 seconds. No burp, right? That's my clear time.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.520]  Yeah. After you finish, we'll start a timer for 30 seconds.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.880]  And what soda is this we're drinking again? Sorry. Just a standard Coke, 500 milliliter bottle.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.780]  Coca-Cola. So the question is, will his body reject the coke?
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:26.040]  I'm going to be completely honest. When I opened it, there was genuine fear. There's a little
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:31.820]  bit of fear. I've never had that before opening a set. Here we go. Okay. I'm so happy we're back.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.860]  I am too. Doing the same stuff. We should close every episode like this.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.160]  All right. Silence so far. Seems to be fine. Yeah.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.480]  Unless he's already dead.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:52.940]  Just some coughs. Okay. We need to know we're doing a do-over. That was a dry run. You guys
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:57.980]  made me laugh. I was laughing while drinking. I got a second bottle. I'm going to take my
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:03.700]  headphones off so you don't make me laugh. Take two. That's just a palate cleanse.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:13.060]  I'm on the edge of my seat. Here we go. I just want to listen. I know.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.580]  Got to get it to be a fly on the wall of that room. I would love to be there. You should talk
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:24.000]  to your flies. See if you can get somebody out there. He might be doing quite well. He's been
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.360]  silent for... I think he's passed out. He's gone blue. Yeah. The soda went to... the bubbles went
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:45.920]  to his brain. It sounded like it came up from the ocean. Are you short on air? What's going on?
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:55.040]  Okay. I'm done with the sodas. It's not... I just... I don't have it in me. It's not my thing.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.920]  What do you mean? I didn't even finish the bottle. I was like 70% of the way through when that
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.160]  happened. You just got to hold him down. I tried. That was... I didn't... you think I just did that
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:11.380]  for fun? I was escaped. But that's the challenge. Grow up, man. Be a man. I lost it. Drink a soda.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.380]  I tried. Okay, listen. I tried. I tried the salad thing. I did the coke thing. I don't know what you
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:21.360]  want from me. Geoff's sending confusing text messages. My mic stand keeps falling over.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:27.000]  Do you still have one bottle? Not a full one. No, I got two half ones at this point. Oh my god.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.280]  I could combine them. Yeah, combine them and then do it again. Yeah, but really focus on holding
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:41.180]  it. Focus. No, I'm not. No. Come on. Here's what we'll do. You do it and then Gavin will do it.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:46.460]  What does that mean? Does Gavin have soda? I can go and grab one, yeah. Okay, you grab one. You do
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.500]  one. If we do them in coordination, I want to hear the crack of the can. I don't fucking trust you.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.260]  All right, hold on. Wait, but this is... you're gonna do it again, right?
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:00.820]  Yeah, of course. You gotta put... you gotta combine those into one full one. I like this.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.440]  I like both of you guys doing this. This is good. What about you? The audience appreciates this.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.840]  What about you? Where's your can? I'm the commentator. Yeah, where's your can?
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:15.920]  Probably in the kitchen. Go get it. Go get a can. All right. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.880]  I love that Andrew's redemption tour is just doing the same shit but worse.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.920]  All right, who's going next? This is it. This is the last... well, no,
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:32.800]  Geoff went. I got Geoff is out to get his soda. I sent him out. Oh, sweet. You roped him into it?
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:38.460]  I roped him into it. Nick, have you got your soda? I'll go get one. Yeah, we gotta get Nick on.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.640]  It's a damn shame Eric isn't here.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.360]  I just love the idea of doing this every week from now. No, I can't. I can't do this every week.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.980]  What do you mean? I'm not good at this. This is not a skill I have. This is how we sign off every
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:06.260]  week. No. I've gone for grapefruit bubbly sparkling water. I feel like that's dangerous.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:15.180]  I will be going with Dr. Pepper cherry zero sugar, 355 milliliters. Okay, Nick is back.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.680]  Okay. Nick, what soda are you using? What do you have on you? I have seven up zero sugar.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.000]  So you guys all have regulations, 350 milliliters, 335, whatever it is,
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:31.500]  cans. I'm in the bottle. Okay, who do we want to take a photo? Just for posterity. Okay,
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:37.080]  you can do that. Okay. So what was harder, the bottle or the can? The can, definitely harder.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.780]  Way harder. So I was right. I just did not get it. I'm trying to get all my burps out before.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.840]  Okay. Yeah, that's a good point. You don't want to go in with a burp. No, I just ate lunch. This
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.140]  is going to be landing on the line. What did you have for lunch today? I had a soup and a sandwich.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:55.720]  Nice. I had a big-ass burger from Hat Creek, so I'm pretty gross. Okay. We good? Are we ready?
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.480]  Ready when you are. Are we all going to go at the same time? Are we going one by one? Now,
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:01.340]  that's an interesting question. Are we going one at a time or are we going together? I feel like
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.880]  one by one to really take in all the attempts. Okay. It'd be hard for me to listen when I've
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.140]  got soda coming out of my nose. You're going to... here's the problem, though. You're going to laugh
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.340]  if we do one by one, and it's a problem. It's a problem. It's hard. I feel like if we all do it
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:17.700]  at once, there's nothing to laugh at. Well, you know, here's the deal. Gav, Gav, hold on. Here's
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.960]  the deal. We're going to be doing this every week anyway. No, we're not. Let's do it Andrew's
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.600]  way today, and then next week we'll do it the other way. We could. I also would support the
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.900]  idea if we do an outro, and we have to rotate the outro as the chug progresses. So somebody starts,
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.680]  whoever's next to fail, they pick up from that point until the end. What on earth are we doing?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.540]  This is getting convoluted. What are we doing? I don't know. I just wanted to drink soda. You
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.180]  guys are talking about regulations and rules. All right, Andrew, you go first. Okay. I don't
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:50.240]  know if that's a yes or whether he's going. He's going. He's going. Focus. Focus. Focus.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:58.260]  You got this. You can do this. Visualize. Be the soda. Did he fall down?
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:11.370]  I heard like a knocking sound and then spit it. What was that? I couldn't. I wouldn't go down.
[01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:16.470]  It just wouldn't go. I've hit my soda threshold. I just spit all my soda to a candle because it
[01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:30.290]  was the only thing I had on my desk. All around you, all over your desk. You couldn't find a cup.
[01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:36.790]  We're going to need your soda candle for the Instagram, Andrew. Go ahead. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:42.550]  Like I spritzed my monitor and I was like, I can't do this. It's the only thing I had.
[01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:47.510]  I guess, Gav, I guess it's Nick's turn. All right. Okay. Here we go. All right.
[01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:56.190]  It was like I was waterboarding myself is what it felt like. It didn't want to go down and it
[01:11:56.190 --> 01:12:02.110]  just kept going. Okay. Done. Wow. All right. Easy peasy. Very impressive. All right. Let's
[01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:07.290]  see if we can hold it. You didn't butt? Not so far. Sounds like he's struggling with it.
[01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:12.450]  Okay. So he's out. He didn't do it. He at least chugged it. That was good. I'm
[01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:21.970]  terrible at chugging. Hi, bro comedy. Geoff, you go ahead. I think I lost. All right.
[01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:29.930]  All right, Gav, your turn. Okay. Am I Geoff? All right. Let's do it. Here we go.
[01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:40.790]  Are you laughing? Is that Gavin laughing? That's a problem when you're chugging.
[01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.090]  Who's laughing?
[01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:50.650]  Nobody was talking. I thought that was Nick. I was like, why is Nick laughing?
[01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.150]  Stop making me laugh.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.980]  Shut up.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.220]  Shut up.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.480]  What is this? What are we making? What happened?
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.740]  I think he's all right. Have you drunk it already?
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.260]  You've already spit everywhere. I don't know.
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.580]  Why are we shutting up? What have you done?
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.540]  You're not saying anything. It's quiet. You keep closing my throat when I laugh.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:23.940]  I thought I sucked. You're terrible. You're awful. You're terrible at this.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:38.200]  I only got about two thirds in. And then he kept making me laugh and my esophagus was just
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:43.420]  closing. It was just piling up in my mouth. I had to struggle to start to get it down. And then
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.060]  so much time had passed. I feel like a minute had passed before I could even try and finish.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:51.220]  That is impossible with headphones on. I'm telling you.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:00.680]  Well, as Click and Clack would say, you've wasted another perfectly good hour listening
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:07.820]  to the F*** Face Podcast. Thanks for tuning in. It sure was great having you here along for all of
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:17.980]  this. And well, we hope you tune in next week. Cowardly move. All right. All right. All right.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:22.560]  I'll take it. I don't think I can top Gavin, though. That was comedy. Are you ready? Yeah.
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:26.980]  I already opened it, unfortunately, but I promise you I'm drinking. I'm going to try. I'm going to
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.900]  try to make it super noticeable to hear me drinking because I feel like I couldn't hear.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.960]  God, Gavin, shut up. Your time's over. It's not about you right now.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:44.840]  Oh, my God. All right, here we go. Are you ready? Yeah, go ahead. I can't hear a thing.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.120]  Taking a break. Taking a break for breathing. What do you mean? It's the quietest drink I've
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:57.400]  ever heard. Take a breath. I can't. The f***ing nerve of you two to talk s*** about my chug and
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.980]  what I'm listening to right now. Observe. OK, I drank the whole soda and it's in my mouth.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.020]  How long do I have to? Am I at 30 seconds yet? I need it to be 30 seconds. OK,
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:15.680]  starting now. Oh, my God, we lost. It doesn't even matter. We're told this s*** about it was
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:22.980]  so easy. That's it. That was it. I just had the one burp. I'm good. See, I feel like I'm a letdown
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:27.460]  after Gavin. Oh, it would have been better just to end it. No, I'm happy the fact that you all
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:32.220]  suck at this, too. You were presenting like I was weird. I drank the whole f***ing thing.
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:36.840]  At least Nick and I drank the whole goddamn thing. Neither of you two managed to do that.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.460]  Well, in my video, I did. It's hard when people are yakking down your ears.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:46.420]  Wasn't hard for me. It's not like y'all weren't yakking down my ears when I was funny.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.080]  That's fair. Totally fair. I'm not sure what we learned today. It was.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.300]  It was excellent. Yeah, it was nice talking to you guys. My tummy hurts now. It was nice
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:03.820]  talking to you guys. You know, I realize we're we've blown our cushion. We haven't we're not
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:09.080]  Yeah, this really should have been a double bill. Yeah. Going into going into summer stuff,
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.840]  that's going to be an issue for us. So we need to eke out an extra episode at some point, I think.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.320]  Yeah, maybe two next week. I don't feel good now. You have the soda sweats. I got the soda sweats.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.860]  I didn't know the soda sweats were a thing until I tried this. Yeah, I've got it like up my throat.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:30.000]  Like, take it. Go north at the uvula. We should probably end this now. Geoff,
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.000]  you want to do that outro? You're doing a great job before. Just a second.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:41.940]  I keep getting like I keep getting like residual fizz. Yeah, my lap is soaking wet as well.
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:50.400]  Oh, you pee pee? Thank you for listening to another episode of F*** Face. The podcast so funny.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:58.200]  Gavin pee pees himself a little bit sometimes. Tune in next week. And as always, if you see a star
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.440]  and that star is empty and you can fill it in by clicking a button, you should do that.
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:11.040]  And write a review and tell your mom, say, hey, mom, the old F*** Face, listen to this podcast.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.740]  And that's it. Bye bye, losers.
