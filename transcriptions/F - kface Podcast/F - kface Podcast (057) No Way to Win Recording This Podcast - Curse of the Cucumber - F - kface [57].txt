[00:00.000 --> 00:06.300]  Pork schnitzel? Why, that's just one of the delicious new recipes I've discovered, thanks to HelloFresh.
[00:06.540 --> 00:08.900]  Are you ready to try America's number one meal kit?
[00:09.160 --> 00:18.320]  We'll get 12 free meals, including free shipping, when you use code FACE14 at hellofresh.com slash face14.
[00:33.970 --> 00:37.010]  So what I did, Eric, is I texted them the night before and I said,
[00:37.170 --> 00:39.790]  Is this a regulation salad? Or is this salad approvable?
[00:39.850 --> 00:41.090]  It was a link to a Wendy's salad.
[00:41.090 --> 00:42.850]  They're like, yeah, it looks like a good salad.
[00:42.910 --> 00:45.450]  So then I used it and gavaged shit on the salad.
[00:45.690 --> 00:50.030]  But what I'm really glad they didn't notice is I actually swapped salads from that point.
[00:50.210 --> 00:52.450]  I picked a different salad than the one that you had.
[00:53.410 --> 00:59.070]  Bullshit! And also, you didn't say, Is this a regulation salad? Can I do salad cream on a salad?
[00:59.130 --> 01:01.290]  You just said, What do you think of this salad?
[01:01.610 --> 01:07.850]  Well, I wanted to save the... it's a surprise. I wanted to wait for the episode and then be like, we're doing this again.
[01:07.910 --> 01:09.450]  Suddenly when you're in the episode, you've got strawberries in it.
[01:09.450 --> 01:13.310]  Well, yeah, okay. So here's the thing. I'm not... I don't really like blue cheese.
[01:13.410 --> 01:17.250]  And I didn't notice that in the salad I sent you to, blue cheese was in it.
[01:17.390 --> 01:18.730]  Blue cheese is fucking gross, dude.
[01:18.870 --> 01:22.090]  I don't really want to eat that. So I just audibled out, swap salad.
[01:22.230 --> 01:27.410]  So when you guys were yelling at me about the salad thing, I was waiting for one of you to bring up the fact that it was a completely different salad.
[01:28.030 --> 01:32.890]  It was a great salad though. And I still... I stand by I gave you what you wanted and it wasn't good.
[01:33.090 --> 01:34.310]  And that's your fault, not mine.
[01:34.330 --> 01:35.510]  What salad are you doing this week?
[01:35.830 --> 01:36.610]  I don't have a salad.
[01:36.910 --> 01:37.130]  Okay.
[01:37.210 --> 01:39.150]  I'm not gonna... I've already redeemed myself in that way.
[01:39.150 --> 01:42.450]  He's just gonna have to chug another soda at the end, like we... as we discussed.
[01:42.690 --> 01:46.670]  Well, Geoff, I think maybe you should chug a soda for the first time, based on what people are saying.
[01:47.030 --> 01:47.910]  Nobody thinks you chugged a soda.
[01:47.910 --> 01:51.270]  I chugged it! It's just fucking easy to do. It's just hard to burp later.
[01:51.490 --> 01:54.470]  I sent Gavin a video doing it to prove that it's not that hard.
[01:54.730 --> 01:55.490]  This is interesting.
[01:55.850 --> 01:58.250]  The audience can suck a butt because I definitely drank it.
[01:58.770 --> 02:03.250]  We're not ahead anymore, so that means that at the time of this, the audience has seen the previous episode.
[02:03.570 --> 02:07.530]  Yeah, I'm all fucked up. It's... we caught up and now I'm terrified.
[02:07.530 --> 02:10.790]  See, this is why... this is why we have a buffer.
[02:11.010 --> 02:15.850]  So that way, it just doesn't turn into more of this, where Geoff is confused and mad.
[02:16.190 --> 02:18.030]  Let Geoff be mad about other stuff.
[02:18.370 --> 02:22.250]  Also, I hate when we have a buffer, because then I never know where the fuck in the timeline I am.
[02:22.410 --> 02:24.810]  There's no way to win in recording this podcast, I realized.
[02:25.030 --> 02:29.410]  We need to talk about this, because the... first of all, why do we not have a buffer?
[02:29.650 --> 02:31.110]  How long has this episode been going, by the way?
[02:31.410 --> 02:32.510]  Uh, well, sort of...
[02:32.510 --> 02:36.270]  I don't know. Hey, guess what? Geoff didn't record earlier. He took a while to record.
[02:36.270 --> 02:39.750]  I'm sorry, I started recording at 2.57.
[02:40.310 --> 02:40.930]  Wow, yeah.
[02:41.910 --> 02:42.310]  Okay.
[02:42.510 --> 02:43.770]  I had to get up and get a soda.
[02:43.890 --> 02:44.710]  That's fine, that's early.
[02:45.010 --> 02:45.590]  Thank you, Gavin.
[02:45.950 --> 02:47.190]  But why do we not have a buffer?
[02:47.510 --> 02:49.770]  Uh, we don't have a buffer, because...
[02:50.830 --> 02:51.550]  I don't know.
[02:51.970 --> 02:58.470]  We don't have a buffer... yes, we do not have a buffer, because you pushed... we weren't able to record,
[02:58.950 --> 03:02.230]  because you were busy doing something for a different podcast.
[03:03.650 --> 03:11.710]  Well, yes, I was doing something for a different podcast, and... but, had I not been doing something for that podcast, I also would have been going to a funeral.
[03:12.310 --> 03:12.610]  So...
[03:12.610 --> 03:12.890]  Okay.
[03:13.370 --> 03:15.370]  It was a double whammy for me that week.
[03:15.850 --> 03:22.490]  Yeah, okay, well, really take the air out of my punch, Geoff. Thank you for doing that. Thank you for just really making me have to, like, pull back.
[03:22.490 --> 03:27.250]  This isn't about that. The fact you were gone... what? I'm not even going to get into the semantics of it.
[03:27.330 --> 03:35.690]  The point of this is... I think... I think that we need to have a serious review over SuperFanJack and his SuperFan status.
[03:36.010 --> 03:43.030]  Oh, dude, don't worry. I'm right there with you. Guess who's... so, tomorrow, we're... you know, if we want to place where this exists in the timeline,
[03:43.490 --> 03:49.930]  we are recording this at 3... it's 3.03 p.m. Central Time, June 24th, 2021.
[03:49.930 --> 03:56.650]  And tomorrow is the second f*** FaceBreak shit, and Jack has already backed out.
[03:57.110 --> 03:59.150]  Already backed out. He's already backed out.
[03:59.510 --> 04:02.970]  But, to Jack's credit, he backed out three days early.
[04:03.230 --> 04:08.350]  Yeah, that's true. I will give him all the credit in the world that he did not do it day of.
[04:08.610 --> 04:12.150]  Yeah, he... he didn't do it moment of, which is appreciative.
[04:12.530 --> 04:18.610]  But I'm prepared... I'm prepared to hear any... any talk regarding demotion of said SuperFandom.
[04:18.610 --> 04:21.870]  I... I ratchet him back... back up as a show of good faith.
[04:21.870 --> 04:26.230]  I think he's nervous. I think he doesn't want to... I think he doesn't ever want to be in f*** Face anything.
[04:26.790 --> 04:32.990]  It's a lot of pressure. We've talked about him so much as the SuperFan. He would have to deliver SuperFanness, and maybe he's not capable.
[04:33.390 --> 04:38.990]  I don't see how we could continue to give him SuperFan status. He's 0 for 2 on these break shit streams.
[04:39.730 --> 04:43.810]  We have moved our podcast. We've not recorded our podcast for his podcast.
[04:43.810 --> 04:51.530]  I bought him a cameo from his favorite... his number one... his favorite person. I got him a cameo... we've done a lot for SuperFan Jack.
[04:51.670 --> 04:56.710]  I made him his own t-shirt. I've never made you a t-shirt. I've never made Gavin a t-shirt.
[04:57.070 --> 05:01.210]  I don't think he can be SuperFan Jack. I think he's... he's gotta... we gotta... he's gotta go back to the minors.
[05:01.670 --> 05:03.470]  I'm not saying he can't work his way back up.
[05:03.790 --> 05:05.210]  What's he doing now? We could call him.
[05:05.570 --> 05:09.170]  We... uh... Minor League Jack is what we'll call him. Minor League Jack.
[05:09.170 --> 05:12.550]  Yeah, I like Minor League Jack. I'm a fan of Minor League Jack.
[05:12.550 --> 05:14.170]  Should I call him right now? Yeah.
[05:14.590 --> 05:16.330]  Yeah, see if he can defend himself, I guess.
[05:16.390 --> 05:18.890]  Let me see if he'll answer. Uh... let's see.
[05:19.210 --> 05:22.710]  I mean, a real SuperFan would answer if, you know, his favorite podcast...
[05:23.250 --> 05:23.430]  That's true.
[05:24.230 --> 05:25.750]  A Minor League guy might not.
[05:25.850 --> 05:27.130]  I hope this is a good idea.
[05:27.670 --> 05:29.190]  Okay, here we go. Hold on. Speaker.
[05:31.230 --> 05:33.070]  Can you guys hear that? Nope. No.
[05:33.510 --> 05:35.430]  Much like the soda shuck. Jack. Non-existent.
[05:35.710 --> 05:36.070]  Geoffrey.
[05:36.070 --> 05:40.070]  Hey, it's Geoff from the F*** Face podcast.
[05:40.470 --> 05:46.110]  You're on my podcast F*** Face right now with me with Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[05:46.250 --> 05:47.690]  Do you have just one second, Jack?
[05:48.090 --> 05:53.550]  No, this is overwhelming. Oh my gosh, yes, yes. I'm excited to be on your podcast F*** Face.
[05:54.650 --> 05:56.750]  Andrew, were you able to hear that? Jack's very excited to be here.
[05:56.930 --> 05:57.870]  No. I didn't hear anything.
[05:58.170 --> 06:01.510]  It's going into the microphone. It's going straight into the microphone. I don't know how you can't hear it.
[06:01.750 --> 06:04.670]  I can't hear Andrew. I feel like this is as made up as your soda.
[06:04.670 --> 06:06.550]  No, no, no. This is questionable at best.
[06:07.410 --> 06:10.650]  Hold on a second, Jack. What the f*** am I supposed to do? How do I pipe it into you, dickhead?
[06:10.790 --> 06:15.210]  It's going into the microphone. I can't help it if you can't f***ing hear it. He's here. Jack, can you hear?
[06:15.290 --> 06:16.130]  I have my mic up, fool.
[06:16.910 --> 06:19.630]  It's up. Your mic is all the way up.
[06:19.670 --> 06:20.630]  I can't hear Gavin either.
[06:20.890 --> 06:24.590]  It's always all the way up. I always got to hold on a second. Hold on a second, Jack. Hold on just one second.
[06:25.630 --> 06:27.210]  Notice Gavin, Geoff said my part.
[06:27.370 --> 06:28.070]  Jack, yell hey.
[06:29.270 --> 06:30.390]  Oh, this is Jack.
[06:30.590 --> 06:31.590]  Oh, that's Jack.
[06:31.830 --> 06:33.050]  We can kind of hear.
[06:33.050 --> 06:35.530]  This is Jack. I'm here. I'm a big fan of the podcast.
[06:35.750 --> 06:35.930]  Can't hear.
[06:36.650 --> 06:38.470]  Yeah, okay. He's f***ing blowing out my microphone.
[06:38.810 --> 06:42.950]  Alright, Andrew wanted me to relay something to you, so since he can't relay it...
[06:43.310 --> 06:45.510]  Well, I got to turn my game back down.
[06:47.310 --> 06:48.910]  Andrew, what did you want me to say to Jack?
[06:49.210 --> 06:53.410]  I just said that I think he can't be a superfan right now. I think he's heading back to the minors.
[06:53.650 --> 06:58.310]  Jack, Andrew has pulled f***face rank as 33% of f***face.
[06:59.310 --> 07:00.990]  I didn't pull rank. It was more of a conversation.
[07:00.990 --> 07:09.050]  He put his foot down and said that you've been stripped of your superfan title, and that you're now Minor League's fan, Jack.
[07:09.130 --> 07:10.810]  You have to work your way back up through the minors.
[07:11.310 --> 07:13.970]  I don't know if I believe a liar.
[07:14.290 --> 07:14.950]  Can't hear him.
[07:15.390 --> 07:21.030]  Okay, well, Jack, this has gone terribly wrong. I'm going to hang up on you now, and I will relay that message. Thank you.
[07:22.570 --> 07:29.370]  I like we're talking about someone who we talk to on Discord daily, and we can't just have him join the Discord for five seconds.
[07:29.370 --> 07:30.650]  I don't know why you didn't do that.
[07:31.310 --> 07:31.870]  Me? What?
[07:31.910 --> 07:35.070]  Well, why didn't you have him join the Discord, then, if you've got all the f***ing ideas?
[07:35.370 --> 07:35.710]  What?
[07:37.130 --> 07:44.110]  Can I point out Geoff's podcast, Gavin? Did you hear that? On my podcast, Geoff said. What happened to the triangle, Geoff?
[07:44.110 --> 07:46.910]  And then I said you're 33% of the f***ing thing.
[07:47.090 --> 07:48.010]  No, no, you didn't.
[07:48.010 --> 07:51.290]  I did just say I said Andrew is 33% of the podcast.
[07:51.710 --> 07:57.670]  Oh, my God. It is my podcast, and it's your podcast, and it's Gavin's podcast. You own a little piece of it.
[07:57.670 --> 08:00.150]  It's a little piece of yours, and you can call it yours.
[08:00.650 --> 08:05.210]  Speaking of, you know, like hosting duties, welcome to f***face. I don't know what episode this is.
[08:05.250 --> 08:09.730]  Hello, and welcome to episode 57, I believe, of f***face. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[08:09.870 --> 08:11.030]  I'd be willing...
[08:11.030 --> 08:12.250]  Well, now you're interrupting the intro.
[08:12.870 --> 08:18.390]  Yeah, it's too late. The intro, this is like 28 minutes in. I'm willing to give up 1% of the triangle.
[08:18.590 --> 08:24.470]  I want to take 32% of the podcast and split the remaining percent equally between Eric and Nick.
[08:24.690 --> 08:25.550]  I think that's a great idea.
[08:25.550 --> 08:29.910]  If I gave you my sauce, Gavin, could I just buy your shares? Could I become the majority owner?
[08:30.410 --> 08:38.290]  Yeah, my percentage of f***face is totally for sale. I'm willing to trade any amount of it, to be honest. I'll take the sauce.
[08:38.730 --> 08:45.550]  Okay. It's a lot... Hey, the sauce is valuable. Like, more valuable than I anticipated. Market value is up.
[08:45.770 --> 08:52.850]  The sauce is no longer available. You can no longer get it in McDonald's outside of Korea. I think those are standard sauces there.
[08:53.030 --> 08:53.870]  Have you made any sales?
[08:53.870 --> 09:03.670]  Have not made any sales. I made an alliance with Nick. We've officially formed a sauce alliance. And I've been searching. I've been tapping into the market, Gavin.
[09:04.270 --> 09:10.590]  I've been asking around. I don't know if you saw this, but I reached out. I asked McDonald's if they would be interested in buying the sauces.
[09:11.110 --> 09:14.550]  So immediately, day one, you're trying to sell it all back to the place that made it.
[09:14.550 --> 09:24.250]  Yeah. Well, I figured, you know, it was a big hit for them. They could use the sauce. They could use some additional sauces. I'm sure a lot of people are saying they couldn't get them. They're running low.
[09:24.670 --> 09:29.490]  I mean, surely a different... Like, surely Burger King wants it more than McDonald's. McDonald's can just make more.
[09:29.810 --> 09:40.110]  Well, that's what you're... You know, well, listen, they need to make it, though. They need to ship it. They need to distribute it. I'm ready to go. I got my sauce tower set. I'm ready. That was my idea.
[09:40.110 --> 09:45.790]  I also... I just didn't know... I was curious how they'd reply. I just wanted to see what McDonald's would do. And what did they say?
[09:46.370 --> 09:50.810]  So I tweeted, hi, McDonald's. And I included McDonald's Canada. You gotta cover all your bases.
[09:51.270 --> 10:01.850]  Now that the BTS meal is gone, I hear you could use some sauce. I'm an honorable man simply looking to unload an empire in exchange for my liquid gold. How about free nuggets for the rest of the year?
[10:01.850 --> 10:09.590]  I eagerly await your response. Hashtag the sauce boss, which I didn't know, I guess, is the nickname of the epic mealtime guy.
[10:09.770 --> 10:16.290]  That's Holly. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't know that. He liked the tweet relating to somebody calling him awesome in exchange for that.
[10:17.250 --> 10:28.250]  So then McDonald's America, quiet. McDonald's Canada, wild response. Quick mass. Wow. 81 sauces. Ice. Is that right? Have you verified?
[10:29.250 --> 10:38.090]  Yeah, I can verify it's more than 81. I don't know where 81 came from. Well, I assume they counted the length, the width, and the height. It's basic volume.
[10:38.910 --> 10:46.970]  It's way more than that. We got a 405 sauce thing. I was kind of disappointed, to be honest. And they did another tweet that, like, they acknowledged it was 405.
[10:47.270 --> 10:54.130]  Oh, they just... it's just terrible maths. Yeah, they did a second one where they're like 405. They're just wildly wrong.
[10:54.130 --> 11:03.750]  They did say quick math. That's right. And it's also, they're not a math company. They make nuggets and burgers. I don't expect a lot from them.
[11:04.010 --> 11:11.830]  But no response. So then I followed up. I extended my offer. I gave an even bigger offer for my second go around.
[11:12.090 --> 11:20.870]  Did a second tweet the following day informing McDonald's that our exclusive negotiating window is now closed. I respect you.
[11:20.870 --> 11:27.790]  So, uh, I can't even read this. I respect you, so the offer stands. I respect you, so the offer stands, but Big Sauce doesn't wait.
[11:27.950 --> 11:37.090]  The sauce game is ongoing. You cannot pause for the sauce game. I now kindly extend my BTS sauce empire for free nuggets offer to Wendy's and Burger King.
[11:37.310 --> 11:47.370]  Don't sleep on this chance at liquid gold. Hashtag clear eyes full sauce can't lose. I have stacked my nugget containers and one of the drink things I got.
[11:47.970 --> 11:53.910]  Actually, I forgot, so they didn't reply to this, so I don't know if they're, you know, they're probably having business meetings.
[11:54.130 --> 12:02.410]  They're probably trying to work out a counteroffer, I assume. I've yet to hear back from Wendy's, Burger King, or McDonald's America.
[12:02.910 --> 12:12.750]  But I forgot to mention this, and just talking about this brings this up. The first day the sauce ended, the BTS sauce expired, the deal, or not the deal, but their offering of it.
[12:12.750 --> 12:21.810]  The 21st, I woke up, I went downstairs, I walked outside, I had a bag of McDonald's at my front door. Just a bag.
[12:22.010 --> 12:29.090]  Yeah, so I was like, what is this? I didn't order this, so I pulled it in, I looked at it, it came from the night before.
[12:29.190 --> 12:38.530]  It was placed at 10.36 p.m., or that's when the receipt was printed. It was delivered to my front door using one of the delivery apps, but not one I use.
[12:38.530 --> 12:44.070]  A different delivery app delivered it to my door, which then, so there's two scenarios in my mind.
[12:44.530 --> 13:06.010]  Either the McDonald's hates me for all the sauce orders, and as a source of revenge, they waited until the evening of the final day that the sauce was available, and sent me like either fucked with, like it was, the order was a medium fries, a large fries, a BLT quarter pounder, and that was, oh, and a soda.
[13:06.010 --> 13:14.870]  A medium soda. So either I feel like they sent it to me and they fucked with me, like they did something to the soda, and just thinking like, oh, they'll think free food, and they'll have it.
[13:15.850 --> 13:24.150]  Or, I have had so many McDonald's orders recently that the driver just assumed I was the person who placed it. They just delivered it there.
[13:24.630 --> 13:36.770]  But it's a different app. But I had rogue McDonald's show it, I felt like it was like a warning. Like it was a threat, or like a declaration of war. I did not see that when I sent those tweets out.
[13:36.970 --> 13:47.070]  Interesting that you, that's how you view it, and not as a peace offering from McDonald's to you. Here are some other fine products we offer that you might enjoy.
[13:47.470 --> 13:49.830]  I feel like a peace offering would be more sauce.
[13:50.430 --> 13:52.510]  Yeah, I was gonna say, I think that would be the true peace offering.
[13:52.510 --> 13:56.470]  I don't think. Burgers that looked gross, and two orders of fries.
[13:56.470 --> 13:58.370]  Well now you're insulting them.
[13:58.830 --> 13:59.590]  It was a gross burger.
[13:59.670 --> 14:06.890]  Andrew, I think you're slightly overwhelmed. I think you're in all kinds of directions at once. I don't think you truly know what you want to do with this sauce.
[14:07.850 --> 14:19.550]  I agree. Well, yeah. No, I don't. It's worth a lot, though. Like, I sent you the listing of like $100 for one sauce of each, and like the container in a bag.
[14:20.830 --> 14:23.430]  So what was that? Was that the packaging? Or was that the actual sauce?
[14:23.790 --> 14:30.570]  That was everything. It was, I think, two sauce containers, and it was the nugget box. The listing I shared that was like $100.
[14:31.070 --> 14:36.130]  Have you been drinking heavily recently, or taking any kind of medication?
[14:36.790 --> 14:37.330]  Or drugs.
[14:37.810 --> 14:41.390]  Are you on any heroin, or any kind of mind-altering drugs right now?
[14:41.410 --> 14:42.410]  No, I'm straight-edge, Geoff.
[14:42.670 --> 14:49.130]  There's no way you could have gotten hammered, or like, I don't know, did some black car heroin, and ordered it yourself?
[14:49.130 --> 14:57.750]  No, because it's not even an app I use. It was a different delivery system than I would ever use. They don't even have my address for the other app.
[14:58.030 --> 15:04.730]  So, I think, I honestly think what most likely happened is they saw McDonald's order this building, and just took it to my door.
[15:05.070 --> 15:10.330]  But my door is so hard to find. Like, it's impressive that it reached me out of all the places it could get.
[15:10.330 --> 15:18.810]  I love that you describe your door like it's magic, and it exists in the Harry Potter universe, and you have to walk by it at a certain time of day.
[15:18.810 --> 15:21.010]  Or do an incantation to discover it.
[15:21.430 --> 15:23.710]  He has the sewing machine towards the wall at the right angle.
[15:24.110 --> 15:29.450]  Right, yeah, right. We've talked about doing a bathtub race thing at some point, Geoff.
[15:29.530 --> 15:36.970]  If you are ever where I live, I will not give you instructions. I'll just tell you the address of my building, and we'll see how long it takes you to find my door.
[15:37.410 --> 15:38.290]  It is not easy.
[15:38.290 --> 15:41.090]  Okay, well, Gavin, you're involved with that too, buddy.
[15:41.590 --> 15:42.390]  Challenge accepted.
[15:42.710 --> 15:43.890]  Alright, that sounds awesome.
[15:43.890 --> 15:51.350]  And I got news for you. We're definitely going to do the bathtub race, but there's another reason we might end up in Canada for f*** face down the road.
[15:51.870 --> 15:52.130]  Really?
[15:52.790 --> 15:58.770]  There's two possibilities in the next year that could bring us to your wonderful, fine island.
[15:59.730 --> 16:03.310]  To the island specifically? Not even just general Canada?
[16:03.330 --> 16:08.350]  Well, to the country, but if I'm going to go to the country, I'm going to make the additional effort to go to your home turf.
[16:08.550 --> 16:12.750]  This is exciting. I haven't heard what the other possible... is it too far out to talk about?
[16:12.750 --> 16:16.810]  I just think it would be more fun for me not to tell you.
[16:17.090 --> 16:19.830]  Okay, well, wait, so you're going to show up one day?
[16:20.190 --> 16:31.390]  No, I'll tell you in good time. I just don't see the point in telling you now. It'll be next year sometime. Maybe a year from now. A year and two months or so, potentially.
[16:31.970 --> 16:33.610]  Hmm, that's concerning.
[16:33.910 --> 16:34.950]  And then I'm going to find your door.
[16:35.270 --> 16:40.430]  I don't think you will. I think you're going to end up having to text me to try to figure out instructions.
[16:41.370 --> 16:46.710]  I'd be impressed if you found it. I would... I don't know what... we should make a bet of some kind.
[16:46.810 --> 16:51.510]  I bet you could not, from the front of my building, you could not find my door within two minutes.
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.550]  Here's how I would do it.
[16:52.650 --> 16:53.650]  Within two minutes?
[16:53.810 --> 16:58.910]  Here's how I would do it. I would order McDonald's to your house, and then I would start the timer.
[16:58.990 --> 17:02.470]  I would start the two-minute timer as soon as the guy showed up, and then I'd just follow him through.
[17:02.890 --> 17:07.490]  He knows how to get there. We've established that. He knows how to get there with your orders, with other people's orders.
[17:07.490 --> 17:09.930]  He's the key to me finding your place instantly.
[17:10.090 --> 17:13.830]  It cost me 99 cents in a delivery fee.
[17:14.230 --> 17:16.690]  I'll order some small fries, and he'll take me right there.
[17:16.950 --> 17:20.650]  Do maps... does Google Maps or anything, does it just put it in the wrong place on the map?
[17:20.770 --> 17:23.230]  Puts it in the wrong place, yeah. Puts it in the wrong place.
[17:23.310 --> 17:24.630]  How do the drivers find it, then?
[17:25.510 --> 17:31.270]  It's... well, on one of the apps, I can manually... and they've changed this, so I don't think I'll be making many food orders anymore.
[17:31.330 --> 17:36.410]  You could manually place where you want them to drive, and I'd kind of put them in the middle of nowhere, essentially.
[17:37.930 --> 17:42.730]  But even still, people would get lost all the time, or I'd get some of the photos I've gotten.
[17:42.830 --> 17:46.570]  If we've left your order here, it's like they've clearly given up, and they don't know what to do.
[17:46.710 --> 17:47.730]  It's just in an alley.
[17:48.190 --> 17:51.710]  Yeah, it's just in a corner somewhere of the building. It's great.
[17:53.670 --> 17:56.250]  I bet I can find it within two minutes. I bet I can do it.
[17:57.390 --> 17:59.170]  I don't think so. Well, it's dependent.
[17:59.170 --> 18:06.990]  We should do it like a survivor challenge, and then we'll do me, and Gavin, and Nick, and Eric, and we'll all try to find it.
[18:07.250 --> 18:11.150]  Building that sauce tower is the most survivor-like experience I've ever had.
[18:11.250 --> 18:18.050]  It was genuinely like my hand was shaky, everything was wobbly, it felt like one of those, they've got to stack it above the point thing.
[18:18.510 --> 18:19.310]  It was terrifying.
[18:25.720 --> 18:30.340]  Summer's here, and the livin' ain't easy if you've got Swamp Ass.
[18:30.340 --> 18:33.400]  I feel like maybe I should've sung that, but I'm not going to.
[18:33.780 --> 18:41.240]  However, I will say that how you stay on top of your sweaty bottom in these hot summer months is important.
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.620]  And I would recommend trying a refreshing spray from a Hello Tushy bidet.
[18:47.120 --> 18:53.760]  Keep your sweaty crack clean all summer long with the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 Modern Bidet Attachment.

[21:04.720 --> 21:06.820]  Have you ever had to find something in a hurry?
[21:07.240 --> 21:10.200]  Yeah, like airport gates. You know, like when you're transferring.
[21:10.200 --> 21:11.760]  I think it's the worst combination.
[21:12.420 --> 21:17.260]  It's so bad when someone's counting on you or you're gonna miss something
[21:17.260 --> 21:21.100]  but you don't know where to look for the thing you're looking for.
[21:21.240 --> 21:25.180]  You kind of end up like frantically jolting around in all directions
[21:25.180 --> 21:26.040]  like looking at shit.
[21:26.320 --> 21:28.520]  And you wanna be moving fast but you don't have a direction
[21:28.520 --> 21:31.140]  so you're just like stuttering around.
[21:31.360 --> 21:34.240]  Yeah, it's a frantic mess. I'm trying to think of other times.
[21:34.400 --> 21:36.880]  I think airports are really like the one time where it's like
[21:36.880 --> 21:40.060]  I don't know where this gate is. I have 10 minutes. What am I gonna do?
[21:40.320 --> 21:44.180]  I was once in Spain. We were filming some Formula One or something.
[21:44.400 --> 21:50.060]  And I realized that the guy I was with didn't bring the mags for the camera.
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.540]  They were still in his hotel room.
[21:52.140 --> 21:54.960]  So I had to be... I was like, oh, I'll go back and get them.
[21:55.380 --> 21:59.600]  And one of the runners drove me back to the little resort where we were staying.
[22:00.200 --> 22:04.080]  And we had a shot in the camera. We just couldn't save it.
[22:04.080 --> 22:07.020]  So everything was waiting on us to download this shot.
[22:07.640 --> 22:12.320]  And I ran back into this resort. It was like a little compound of maybe like 50 villas.
[22:12.780 --> 22:16.800]  But I got lost. I'd only seen it in the dark.
[22:17.060 --> 22:20.220]  And it was confusing me during the day.
[22:20.600 --> 22:23.040]  So I was like, uh-oh, where's the... And I couldn't find the number.
[22:23.120 --> 22:28.000]  And I was just running around. I must have spent 5 minutes running full speed
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.060]  but not knowing where I was running.
[22:30.060 --> 22:34.080]  I must have looked like a completely insane person, like a chicken with his head cut off.
[22:34.320 --> 22:36.760]  And I was freaking out. I thought I was going to black out by the end of it.
[22:36.800 --> 22:40.040]  I was like... Everyone's waiting. Everyone's waiting.
[22:40.700 --> 22:43.420]  And eventually I found it. And it was like really close to the entrance.
[22:45.540 --> 22:50.340]  That's... I keep getting... So, like, this is a weird... Like, it wasn't super frantic.
[22:50.820 --> 22:54.500]  I got lost in Austin one time. I don't think I've told the story on the podcast.
[22:54.520 --> 22:56.140]  Is this pre or post ankle roll?
[22:56.820 --> 23:01.240]  This is... This is pre-ankle roll. My ankle is fine at this point.
[23:01.640 --> 23:06.520]  I have two distinctive lost in Austin stories. It always seems to happen around RTX.
[23:06.780 --> 23:08.140]  I guess that's the main reason why I'm in Austin.
[23:08.740 --> 23:14.020]  But it was the night... I am, like, one of the 12 people that didn't mind True Detective Season 2.
[23:14.640 --> 23:18.900]  And it was... The finale was on, like, the closing night of RTX.
[23:19.440 --> 23:23.440]  And Caleb invited me to this bar thing where I guess they'd, like, every year...
[23:23.440 --> 23:27.320]  They'd, like, a bunch of people would get together in the community, do, like, a community event at this place.
[23:27.920 --> 23:31.960]  And it was, like, maybe two blocks away from where I was staying, the hotel I was at.
[23:32.160 --> 23:39.360]  And this guy that I met through the community really wanted to play rock-paper-scissors against me for whatever reason.
[23:39.940 --> 23:43.600]  And I was like, meet me. I'll meet you outside of this hotel.
[23:43.980 --> 23:48.180]  We can play rock-paper-scissors and we can walk and talk to this bar that I have to go to.
[23:48.580 --> 23:50.160]  So that's what we did. I won, by the way.
[23:50.360 --> 23:53.060]  Do you play rock-paper-scissors a lot with a lot of people?
[23:53.060 --> 23:57.080]  I don't play rock... No, it was their thing. They really wanted to play rock-paper-scissors.
[23:57.280 --> 23:58.240]  I was like, sure, I'll play.
[23:58.340 --> 24:02.120]  I just love the idea of you and someone else in an alley, the police roll up.
[24:02.260 --> 24:03.960]  It's like, alright, where's the drugs?
[24:04.160 --> 24:07.620]  And it's like, no, sir, we were just playing rock-paper-scissors. Don't worry about it.
[24:07.640 --> 24:07.900]  I love it.
[24:07.920 --> 24:08.520]  It's normal.
[24:09.540 --> 24:13.140]  Well, I'm very competitive, so I... Luckily, I won. I think it was close.
[24:13.200 --> 24:16.200]  I think he won the first one, I won the next three. I don't remember exactly.
[24:16.280 --> 24:17.940]  But then we walked and talked to the place.
[24:18.520 --> 24:21.260]  And I stayed... I just hung out. I didn't really do anything.
[24:21.260 --> 24:24.840]  I played pinball mainly for like two or three hours at this party.
[24:24.920 --> 24:28.420]  Do you think you're good at rock-paper-scissors? Like, better than the average person?
[24:28.700 --> 24:32.520]  I don't think so. I think I'm actually especially bad at rock-paper-scissors.
[24:32.700 --> 24:34.300]  I'd say I'm a bad rock-paper-scissors player.
[24:34.580 --> 24:35.940]  Fair enough. Which pinball do you play?
[24:36.140 --> 24:42.040]  I don't remember. It was just like a whatever. It was like me being bad at a party, not really knowing anybody and being awkward.
[24:42.200 --> 24:44.680]  So I'm just gonna play pinball in the corner and kill time.
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.000]  If it makes you feel any better, that bar that you went to, that they would go to every year, I'm pretty sure it closed down.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.080]  Yes, it's closed. It is gone.
[24:50.080 --> 24:55.140]  I don't know why that would make me feel any better at all. I mean, it's not the bar's fault.
[24:55.800 --> 24:57.880]  Isn't it? Isn't it the bar's fault, Andrew?
[24:57.940 --> 24:59.240]  No, it was a great bar.
[24:59.320 --> 25:02.640]  Don't they promise a good time? Did you have a good time? It sounded horrible.
[25:02.920 --> 25:06.440]  I think a good time was there. It's just I couldn't find it. That's my fault.
[25:07.160 --> 25:10.880]  But I think it existed within the premises. I just was too awkward to like...
[25:10.880 --> 25:13.440]  You had all the ingredients. You just couldn't make it into a good time.
[25:13.460 --> 25:14.280]  You just couldn't bake the cake.
[25:14.740 --> 25:20.320]  Okay, so the first part, there was like a UFC event on, and they had a giant TV, so I watched that on a couch.
[25:20.440 --> 25:22.300]  I was like, this is pretty good, and then I played pinball.
[25:22.640 --> 25:27.760]  So like, as far as my evening goes, not bad, but terrible party, as far as my involvement in it.
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.040]  So then I leave, and I left because I wanted to catch the finale of True Detective Season 2.
[25:33.140 --> 25:39.240]  And I gave myself like 30 minutes to go, and I just kept walking, and I couldn't quite remember my turn
[25:39.240 --> 25:42.440]  because I spent the entire time talking to the guy, so I wasn't really mindful of...
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.940]  All I had to do was literally, I took one turn and then walked straight.
[25:46.160 --> 25:48.840]  So I just had to turn once, and I was set.
[25:49.180 --> 25:52.520]  Or you could have opened a map on your iPhone. Could have done that.
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.700]  I didn't have my phone. My phone died at the party. That's what happened.
[25:57.080 --> 26:00.680]  Both times I've been lost, my phone died at the party, so I didn't have access to my phone,
[26:00.720 --> 26:03.180]  or else I wouldn't have used my phone. That would have solved this immediately.
[26:03.440 --> 26:08.320]  So I had no phone, and I just am going straight, and I'm like, eventually I'll find a turn.
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.620]  Every street I'd pass, I'd be like, I don't think that was it, and I'd just keep walking.
[26:13.160 --> 26:15.800]  And I realized I had missed my turn when I ran out of buildings.
[26:15.960 --> 26:21.180]  There were no longer any buildings ahead of me. I was leaving the city, essentially, at that point.
[26:22.340 --> 26:26.740]  It's like 11pm, maybe a little bit earlier. It's like 10.30ish, 11.
[26:27.020 --> 26:33.580]  And everything in the area wasn't really open, and I'm sweating because it's hot, and it's the summer.
[26:33.580 --> 26:40.320]  And I'm just going up to people asking, like, hey, I stayed here, could you tell me where it is?
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.980]  I have no idea where I'm going. And they'd kinda point sometimes, or they'd just ignore me.
[26:45.200 --> 26:51.160]  It was a disaster. I spent like 30 minutes lost, walking through the city at night,
[26:51.560 --> 26:58.020]  trying to find my hotel, which I know is close. It's within probably 10 minutes of wherever I am.
[26:58.020 --> 27:05.760]  I came across two extremely drunk ladies who were thrilled by the fact that I was from Canada.
[27:06.200 --> 27:10.760]  And they were kind enough to use their phone to help me, but they were too drunk to be useful in any way.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.980]  So they also just gave me kinda shitty directions. I spent like an hour lost by the end of it.
[27:17.020 --> 27:20.620]  Just walking up and down streets, going around, trying to ask people. Nobody would help me.
[27:21.060 --> 27:25.960]  Eventually I came across one of those bike carts that are intended for multiple people.
[27:25.960 --> 27:31.700]  And I'm like, I'll pay you whatever. Just, this is my hotel, I'm so lost, please take me to this place.
[27:31.920 --> 27:32.820]  Like a little pedicab?
[27:33.180 --> 27:36.940]  Yeah, like a little pedicab. And I hopped in, I just had a great conversation.
[27:37.100 --> 27:44.540]  He was playing Def Leppard extremely loudly. It was like 11pm, his last job was a gravedigger in New Orleans,
[27:44.680 --> 27:50.260]  so I just asked him about that. And it was just like the most bizarre evening, like the conclusion to it.
[27:50.600 --> 27:55.180]  I finish, I get back to the hotel, I'm way late for watching the True Detective finale.
[27:55.180 --> 28:04.120]  I turn it on, and I mean, spoilers for True Detective season 2, there's a character in it who dies by having an extended walk through the desert.
[28:04.360 --> 28:09.860]  And that's the exact thing I walked into. It was just this character walking, trying to make it back to the city.
[28:10.280 --> 28:13.220]  It was like Gavin in this fly thing. It perfectly lined up.
[28:14.340 --> 28:20.980]  But yeah, I got, it was just a disaster. Every time, both times I've been lost in Austin, it's because my phone died and I've gotten shitty directions.
[28:21.140 --> 28:23.500]  And Caleb was the source of both of them, now I think about it.
[28:23.500 --> 28:29.680]  I just like that you always go to these other cities, miles, not even in your own country, and you refuse to charge your phone every night.
[28:30.220 --> 28:36.740]  Yeah. It was charged, it's just, I was there for a few hours, it died. I don't know, I've always had shitty phones.
[28:37.040 --> 28:38.760]  Outside of my most recent two.
[28:39.700 --> 28:45.560]  It's impressive as well in that, I guess not the case anymore because of the explosive growth of the last two or three years,
[28:45.660 --> 28:49.860]  but this is at a time when Austin didn't have that many big buildings.
[28:49.860 --> 28:51.260]  Yeah, well that's how I knew.
[28:51.360 --> 28:57.460]  Not that much of a city, so it's like, process of elimination, you probably could have walked to every big building in 30 minutes in Austin.
[28:57.880 --> 29:05.040]  That's how I realized I went too far, is the big buildings stopped existing. It was just all flat. That was my sign that I'm out of the city now.
[29:05.040 --> 29:06.420]  They started getting really small in the back.
[29:06.420 --> 29:08.540]  Yeah, everything got really tiny.
[29:08.860 --> 29:14.820]  I'm imagining you walking out of the side of Austin into the desert. You're probably just like two blocks away.
[29:14.820 --> 29:21.540]  That was the first time. The second time, it was the day after it was won. That guy drove me from San Antonio to Austin.
[29:21.820 --> 29:28.800]  The next day, I was like, I want a burger. I went to a burger place that was close, and it happened to be a place that you took me to, Geoff.
[29:28.860 --> 29:33.600]  The first time I went to Austin, you and Caleb, it was this tiny bar burger place.
[29:34.040 --> 29:34.820]  Casino El Camino.
[29:35.060 --> 29:36.640]  No, it wasn't that one. It was a different one.
[29:36.900 --> 29:38.220]  When was my invite, by the way, to that?
[29:38.500 --> 29:39.200]  I don't know.
[29:39.460 --> 29:40.520]  Do you remember what it was called?
[29:40.820 --> 29:44.300]  I have no memory of what it was called. I also think that that business no longer exists.
[29:44.760 --> 29:45.160]  Probably.
[29:45.620 --> 29:51.380]  It was small, but I was like, oh, I've been here. I didn't realize this was the place I'd been before. That's cool. Had a burger. Had a great time.
[29:51.760 --> 29:57.160]  Next day, Caleb and I went for lunch during RTX. And during the lunch, my phone died.
[29:57.780 --> 30:08.920]  And so we ate lunch, and I said, Caleb, my phone is dead. I don't know where my place is, but I know how to get from that bar slash burger place to my place.
[30:08.920 --> 30:14.740]  So if you could tell me where that burger bar place is, it's not far away. Just tell me where it is.
[30:14.840 --> 30:18.100]  And he once again, his instructions were, he pointed. He's like, that way.
[30:18.480 --> 30:20.820]  So then I just started walking in that direction.
[30:21.240 --> 30:24.060]  Found somebody else at the convention center who walked with me for a bit.
[30:24.400 --> 30:26.660]  And we were talking, and he offered me his resume.
[30:27.140 --> 30:29.720]  I said, I can't really help you get a job.
[30:30.180 --> 30:32.240]  And then he was like, cool, I gotta go.
[30:32.340 --> 30:33.600]  So then he abandoned me.
[30:33.980 --> 30:37.600]  I remembered I crossed train tracks going from point A to point B.
[30:37.600 --> 30:41.240]  So I just stood on the train tracks, and I just kept walking down them.
[30:41.280 --> 30:43.960]  Because I was like, eventually, once again, I'll find my turn.
[30:44.320 --> 30:49.740]  In the heat, I'm miserable, once again, just drenched in sweat, walking down the train tracks.
[30:49.980 --> 30:53.640]  I was probably like 15 minutes away from having a breakdown.
[30:53.980 --> 30:55.840]  I was like, I'm so lost.
[30:56.840 --> 30:59.240]  But then I looked up, and I was right in front of my building.
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.740]  I don't know how I got there, but I just made it back.
[31:01.800 --> 31:03.300]  And I was like, oh, that's super convenient.
[31:03.700 --> 31:04.360]  And I was good.
[31:04.720 --> 31:07.960]  Do you think maybe it's not hard to find your front door at all?
[31:08.040 --> 31:10.140]  It's just hard for you to find your front door?
[31:10.840 --> 31:15.540]  I mean, just based off every story you've ever told about you getting from point A to point B?
[31:15.900 --> 31:20.220]  No, it's just, if I was guided to the bar, I knew where to go, because it was a straight shot.
[31:20.300 --> 31:23.500]  And I still found it, but I relied on the train tracks.
[31:23.620 --> 31:24.980]  I was just walking down the tracks.
[31:25.580 --> 31:26.160]  It's terrible.
[31:26.560 --> 31:27.800]  I'm good at getting lost, apparently.
[31:28.020 --> 31:30.200]  I am not convinced your place is hard to find.
[31:30.340 --> 31:30.760]  I'm sorry.
[31:31.180 --> 31:32.100]  No, it is.
[31:32.980 --> 31:34.260]  This is what we'll do.
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.380]  It's definitely hard for you to find, but I think most things are.
[31:37.560 --> 31:40.860]  What if we... you know those tablets that are on wheels?
[31:41.040 --> 31:44.640]  It's a moped-slash-tablet, and you can see through it?
[31:44.680 --> 31:45.820]  What are the range on those?
[31:45.960 --> 31:50.220]  If I set one up in front of my building, I bet you couldn't find my door within the two minutes.
[31:50.360 --> 31:51.960]  I would love to do this.
[31:52.320 --> 31:55.020]  We have to figure out a way to do long-range camera feed.
[31:55.120 --> 31:57.880]  I don't know if that technology even exists for how we want to use it.
[31:57.900 --> 31:58.740]  It does, yeah.
[31:59.320 --> 31:59.800]  We could do that.
[31:59.800 --> 32:00.600]  Yeah, we can do that.
[32:00.600 --> 32:01.820]  We'll find a way.
[32:02.380 --> 32:05.220]  You always have weird interactions with people, by the sounds of it.
[32:05.400 --> 32:07.640]  Oh, the weirdest! The weirdest interactions!
[32:07.640 --> 32:11.160]  You didn't even ever tell us about the orgy invite or anything.
[32:12.100 --> 32:13.700]  I've had weird interactions in Austin, too.
[32:13.800 --> 32:19.580]  I feel like some of them, you know, you can put out a vibe whether or not you want to be spoken to by strangers.
[32:20.020 --> 32:22.040]  But I feel like when I first moved here, I was all for it.
[32:22.100 --> 32:23.000]  You know, I was in a new country.
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.840]  If people came up and spoke to me, I'd be like, oh, hey, what's up?
[32:25.840 --> 32:32.440]  When we lived in that rental house, Geoff, I think I'd walked to Fresh Plus or something and I was walking back.
[32:32.900 --> 32:37.320]  And some girl stopped me and she was like, hey, can I talk to you about Planned Parenthood?
[32:37.620 --> 32:41.040]  And I was like, yeah, what's that?
[32:41.180 --> 32:42.480]  And she was like, all right, douchebag.
[32:42.740 --> 32:44.560]  And just turned her back on me and walked off.
[32:44.900 --> 32:46.540]  Because I didn't know what it was.
[32:47.160 --> 32:48.960]  And she thought I was taking the piss.
[32:49.720 --> 32:51.720]  I assume everyone here knows what it is.
[32:51.780 --> 32:53.380]  They just wanted to tell people about it.
[32:53.460 --> 32:54.940]  And I was like, what's Planned Parenthood?
[32:54.940 --> 32:57.200]  And she was having none of it.
[32:57.300 --> 32:59.760]  And I just walked home just like, what did I do?
[33:00.240 --> 33:06.660]  She wanted you to sign your signature on something or to donate money probably to Planned Parenthood.
[33:06.920 --> 33:10.740]  And she probably thought you were putting on a fake accent or just being dismissive.
[33:11.060 --> 33:13.640]  Because those people get shit on all day long by strangers.
[33:13.940 --> 33:14.820]  That's really funny.
[33:15.480 --> 33:16.660]  Yeah, she was really mean.
[33:16.840 --> 33:18.000]  I was just being friendly.
[33:19.300 --> 33:22.180]  That probably ruined the next hour.
[33:22.640 --> 33:24.440]  It probably ruined her next hour, too.
[33:24.440 --> 33:28.800]  She went home and she was like, I swear to God, all I'm trying to do is raise money for Planned Parenthood.
[33:28.920 --> 33:31.260]  And every fucking dude I talk to is a dickhead to me.
[33:32.500 --> 33:36.060]  This guy earlier today, he pretended not to know what it is.
[33:36.280 --> 33:39.200]  And he used a bad, bad British accent.
[33:41.860 --> 33:46.300]  I don't think I even fully told the homeless orgy story thing.
[33:46.700 --> 33:49.940]  So that happened because I was with somebody who didn't know how to use Uber.
[33:50.060 --> 33:52.680]  And they put the pickup point like six blocks away.
[33:52.840 --> 33:53.760]  In the middle of an orgy?
[33:53.760 --> 33:55.180]  They pinned an orgy?
[33:55.540 --> 33:55.580]  No, no, no, no.
[33:55.620 --> 33:57.000]  We're outside RTX.
[33:58.060 --> 34:00.600]  I never made it to the homeless orgy, Gavin.
[34:00.700 --> 34:03.020]  It was an invite that was presented to me.
[34:03.320 --> 34:05.120]  We're outside the convention center.
[34:05.340 --> 34:06.960]  We're trying to get back to our place.
[34:07.380 --> 34:09.840]  This is not only just pre-ankle roll.
[34:09.960 --> 34:14.100]  This is pre-me having the flu and getting everybody that I was with sick.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.280]  He's like, I'll call an Uber.
[34:18.500 --> 34:18.980]  Oh, it's weird.
[34:19.060 --> 34:20.940]  It keeps telling me we have to go do it.
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.220]  And it's like seven blocks away.
[34:22.220 --> 34:23.800]  And so we're just walking, walking.
[34:23.900 --> 34:26.760]  This homeless guy walks up and is like, hey, can I have money?
[34:26.840 --> 34:27.740]  And I was like, sure.
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.160]  I gave him some money.
[34:29.340 --> 34:30.740]  And then we became best friends.
[34:30.920 --> 34:32.180]  And he was following me.
[34:32.260 --> 34:33.280]  We're talking the whole way.
[34:34.060 --> 34:36.320]  And I had a Seattle Seahawks shirt on.
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.000]  And he was talking to me about football.
[34:38.440 --> 34:41.160]  And he's like, you think the Seattle Seahawks are going to win this year?
[34:41.260 --> 34:42.340]  I didn't really think so.
[34:42.380 --> 34:43.220]  I was like, yeah, maybe.
[34:43.700 --> 34:44.840]  And then he's like, nah.
[34:45.200 --> 34:48.860]  You think the Seattle Seahawks are going to win the Super Bowl this year?
[34:49.220 --> 34:50.020]  And I was like, yeah.
[34:50.020 --> 34:54.260]  He's like, you think the Seattle Seahawks are going to win the Super Bowl this year?
[34:54.380 --> 34:55.580]  And I'm like, yeah, they're going to win!
[34:55.660 --> 34:58.300]  Because it's like I'm a fucking budget Jerry Maguire.
[34:58.460 --> 35:01.400]  Like, he wanted me to yell about it, and I was just playing into his thing.
[35:01.700 --> 35:03.200]  And so I was like, yeah, they're going to win!
[35:03.220 --> 35:05.140]  And he's like, I don't like their chances this year.
[35:05.560 --> 35:06.780]  I was like, why did we do that?
[35:06.880 --> 35:07.880]  What was the point?
[35:08.420 --> 35:09.000]  Like, why?
[35:09.380 --> 35:13.760]  I think the point was to keep you engaged long enough to get you behind an alley somewhere
[35:13.760 --> 35:17.180]  where he could stab you and have a brand new Seattle Seahawks jersey to walk around in.
[35:17.180 --> 35:18.340]  Or play Pacino's.
[35:18.540 --> 35:18.880]  Yeah.
[35:19.860 --> 35:23.560]  So then we kept walking, and he just kept talking to me.
[35:24.060 --> 35:29.320]  And we're crossing a section, and I think somebody realized it was sort of a weird conversation we were having.
[35:29.660 --> 35:31.800]  And they shoulder-checked him in the crosswalk.
[35:32.020 --> 35:33.400]  And that stopped him for a minute.
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.220]  And he turned, and he was like, what the fuck to the guy?
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.280]  And I think the point was to try to allow me to get distance.
[35:38.640 --> 35:42.600]  But as soon as we crossed the street, my friend was like, oh, this is where we gotta be for the car.
[35:42.980 --> 35:46.020]  So then I'm just standing there, and the homeless guy comes back.
[35:46.020 --> 35:49.120]  And this is where it elevated to another level.
[35:49.500 --> 35:52.800]  He looked at me, and it was like...
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.980]  I would describe the vibe as like Anton Chigurh in the gas station of No Country for Old Men.
[35:59.200 --> 36:00.620]  There's like this weird tension.
[36:00.980 --> 36:04.900]  And he was just staring at me, and he's like, you have the prettiest eyes I've ever seen.
[36:05.280 --> 36:08.860]  I was like, oh great, we are going somewhere.
[36:09.360 --> 36:10.180]  What color are your eyes?
[36:10.660 --> 36:13.420]  I'd say like a blue, like a darkish blue.
[36:14.820 --> 36:15.300]  Dreamy.
[36:15.860 --> 36:17.580]  Yes, exactly, according to him.
[36:18.320 --> 36:21.300]  And then it turned into, why are you here?
[36:22.460 --> 36:27.860]  And I was like, whenever I try to describe RTX to somebody that would have no concept of what it is,
[36:28.200 --> 36:30.420]  I always just say, it's like a video game convention.
[36:31.480 --> 36:35.480]  And he's like, oh, so you're telling me you run all this shit?
[36:35.980 --> 36:37.440]  And he meant the city of Austin.
[36:38.300 --> 36:43.420]  And I was like, no, I just, you know, I like games and stuff, so I'm here for that.
[36:43.560 --> 36:45.760]  And he's like, oh, so you're a hacker and shit?
[36:45.900 --> 36:47.920]  And then he started going, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[36:48.200 --> 36:51.120]  And I was like, no, I just, I like video games.
[36:51.200 --> 36:53.980]  And then he was trying to convince me to go on his workout plan.
[36:54.060 --> 36:56.820]  He's like, you and I can work out, we have a great time.
[36:57.100 --> 36:59.440]  We'll work out, we'll have so much fun.
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.960]  Then it pivoted to that he knew a guy who had a bunch of drugs.
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.180]  And then it pivoted to, where are you staying at? I can bring the party.
[37:09.740 --> 37:15.020]  And it was like a very clear implication of, I don't remember the wording, but it was like, we're going to have an orgy.
[37:15.380 --> 37:15.980]  How was it?
[37:16.220 --> 37:17.180]  How was what? The orgy?
[37:17.380 --> 37:17.720]  Yeah.
[37:18.120 --> 37:18.840]  Not enough condoms.
[37:19.620 --> 37:20.020]  But...
[37:20.020 --> 37:25.340]  Can you imagine the podcast you two could have started together if you had just told him where he stayed?
[37:25.900 --> 37:29.040]  Well, he doesn't know where he stayed, he couldn't find the damn place.
[37:29.380 --> 37:30.100]  That's true.
[37:31.920 --> 37:35.260]  Andrew's like, I'll give you my address in Vancouver Island, but you're never going to find it.
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.740]  The dude's walking around with him and us, and he's like, we're going in circles, man, where are you staying?
[37:40.920 --> 37:41.880]  And you're like, I don't know!
[37:44.820 --> 37:46.760]  The entire time, I don't think I blinked.
[37:46.800 --> 37:49.200]  Like, we're having a weird stare down for this whole conversation.
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.720]  And he's like, where are you staying?
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.020]  And I panicked and I lied.
[37:53.100 --> 37:55.760]  I just said, I'm at the Hilton, 26th floor.
[37:56.060 --> 37:57.020]  I just came up with the floor.
[37:57.280 --> 37:58.220]  And he's like, cool.
[37:58.480 --> 37:59.240]  And he walked away.
[37:59.240 --> 38:00.700]  I never saw him again.
[38:00.840 --> 38:02.080]  We got in our car.
[38:02.240 --> 38:12.440]  Do you think somebody who maybe looked reasonably like you, or even not that like you, on the 6th floor of the Hilton, just had a surprise orgy happen in their laps?
[38:13.040 --> 38:15.820]  I'm curious what happened that evening on the 26th floor.
[38:16.200 --> 38:16.920]  I'd love to know.
[38:17.040 --> 38:17.460]  I hope nothing happened.
[38:17.460 --> 38:18.020]  Yeah, yeah, 26th floor.
[38:18.680 --> 38:20.360]  Sounds like a lot of fun might have happened.
[38:21.140 --> 38:22.280]  We get in the car.
[38:22.840 --> 38:24.040]  I feel so sick.
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.420]  And I don't know that I have a flu at this point.
[38:26.660 --> 38:28.300]  Dealing with fever, flu, everything.
[38:28.300 --> 38:29.020]  I was super sick.
[38:29.380 --> 38:30.180]  Get home.
[38:30.360 --> 38:31.740]  I immediately vomit.
[38:31.920 --> 38:34.320]  And it was the day that I tried Big Red for the first time.
[38:34.420 --> 38:35.720]  So just bright red puke.
[38:36.280 --> 38:37.120]  Vomit everywhere.
[38:37.600 --> 38:39.080]  And I got everybody sick.
[38:39.320 --> 38:40.140]  But I just, yeah.
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.340]  I don't know what it is about me, but I draw weird interaction with people.
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.000]  It's like I have a magnet to it.
[38:46.220 --> 38:49.200]  It could be fun, or it could be you're invited to a homeless orgy.
[38:49.500 --> 38:50.440]  Which also could be fun.
[38:50.760 --> 38:52.260]  Yeah, it could be.
[38:52.700 --> 38:54.120]  Can't complain about that necessarily.
[38:54.120 --> 39:00.280]  I don't know that I'd want to be the kind of guy who goes an entire life without ever getting invited to a homeless orgy, you know?
[39:00.840 --> 39:01.780]  Is that a life worth living?
[39:02.400 --> 39:02.940]  That's true.
[39:02.940 --> 39:03.180]  Yes.
[39:03.940 --> 39:04.520]  Great point.
[39:04.560 --> 39:06.640]  How many homeless orgies have you been invited to, Gavin?
[39:07.460 --> 39:08.260]  Not any.
[39:08.840 --> 39:09.200]  Not any.
[39:09.240 --> 39:09.320]  Yeah, see?
[39:10.180 --> 39:10.380]  Hmm.
[39:10.660 --> 39:11.960]  What a sad, sad life.
[39:12.480 --> 39:13.220]  For a sad little man.
[39:13.460 --> 39:16.240]  I didn't know that you filmed F1 stuff, Gavin.
[39:16.460 --> 39:17.940]  Dude, he filmed Fernando Alonso.
[39:18.260 --> 39:18.620]  He did?
[39:18.640 --> 39:19.400]  That's what I was doing.
[39:19.700 --> 39:20.560]  Alonso was waiting.
[39:21.200 --> 39:22.180]  I had no idea.
[39:23.620 --> 39:26.840]  I don't think it was actually for... it wasn't a real Formula 1 race.
[39:26.960 --> 39:34.040]  It was a commercial for Santander or something, who maybe sponsored some... I don't know.
[39:34.620 --> 39:35.020]  Who knows?
[39:35.520 --> 39:37.680]  I don't really know all about all the stuff I worked on.
[39:37.780 --> 39:39.940]  Sometimes you just show up and shoot it and then you never see it.
[39:40.980 --> 39:43.600]  It probably didn't even air in the UK or anything.
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.660]  Do you remember what the commercial was?
[39:46.200 --> 39:46.640]  I don't know.
[39:47.340 --> 39:48.420]  I can show you the footage if you want.
[39:48.800 --> 39:50.100]  I'd love to see the footage.
[39:50.120 --> 39:51.120]  You still have the footage?
[39:51.120 --> 39:53.260]  Yeah, I got most of the stuff I shot.
[39:53.900 --> 39:54.300]  That's awesome.
[39:54.300 --> 39:54.900]  That's really cool.
[39:55.080 --> 40:00.740]  It is pretty cool. It makes me respect him a little bit more when I find out he's worked on stuff that I now like, like F1.
[40:01.560 --> 40:03.360]  Why do you like F1 so much now?
[40:03.480 --> 40:04.220]  Have you ever watched it?
[40:04.460 --> 40:04.640]  Yeah.
[40:04.920 --> 40:05.700]  It's fucking awesome.
[40:07.440 --> 40:09.020]  It's a hard point to argue against.
[40:09.760 --> 40:11.580]  I mean, I feel like that's the answer.
[40:11.680 --> 40:14.120]  Yeah, it's cool. I mean, like, technically it's very cool.
[40:14.500 --> 40:18.000]  It's not... I find it not very fun to watch in person, though.
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.800]  I've never seen a race in person.
[40:19.800 --> 40:23.040]  You really don't get a sense of, like, where the race is.
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.900]  If you're on a corner, you just kind of see cars pass by, and you don't...
[40:26.900 --> 40:29.080]  It really is much better televised, I think.
[40:29.380 --> 40:31.600]  I feel like most sporting events are better televised.
[40:31.760 --> 40:32.980]  Yeah, I agree.
[40:33.760 --> 40:37.900]  A football match? That's nice in person. You get the vibe. You get the cheering.
[40:38.220 --> 40:40.680]  You get people standing up in front of you and not sitting down for half an hour.
[40:41.620 --> 40:44.280]  That's fucking annoying. Oh my god, dude.
[40:46.060 --> 40:52.580]  It's funny, because I made a joke. Gavin and I went to a... what was that? Last Saturday, I guess?
[40:52.980 --> 40:53.180]  Yeah.
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.580]  First off, we hung out in person, and nothing blew up.
[40:57.080 --> 41:02.840]  Everything held. There was no extra weirdness, aside from I got some cucumbers given to me.
[41:02.900 --> 41:08.380]  Alright, well, that was fucking weird. That in itself was a whole... there was a whole thing.
[41:08.840 --> 41:11.100]  Andrew, there was a whole thing. Did you hear about the cucumbers?
[41:11.620 --> 41:13.080]  No, I have no idea about the cucumbers.
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.100]  Well, we should get into it, because it was fascinating to me.
[41:17.340 --> 41:25.720]  However, yeah, we spent an entire time hanging out, and I'd say it was a pretty medium, decent time.
[41:26.520 --> 41:33.300]  I was telling Andrew, I don't know what we would... nothing funny happened, nothing gross happened, nothing weird happened.
[41:33.440 --> 41:35.140]  It was just a medium time?
[41:35.480 --> 41:38.520]  I mean, it was nice. It was a good time. I had a lovely time.
[41:38.520 --> 41:46.380]  It was me and you and Emily and Millicent, and we went to see the first home game of the Austin FC soccer... MLS soccer team.
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.760]  Nothing of, like, fuck-face note happened, which means it was a good time.
[41:51.020 --> 41:57.520]  Yeah. I mean, I will say, we had to endure Matthew McConaughey looking like a goddamn leprechaun.
[41:57.980 --> 41:58.180]  That was weird.
[41:58.180 --> 41:58.920]  Oh, I love that bit.
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.500]  Andrew, he came out because he's a part owner of the team, and because he has to, you know,
[42:04.520 --> 42:07.560]  McConaughey bless all of... every cool thing in Austin, you know?
[42:07.560 --> 42:14.080]  Well, first off, he did, like, a scat-type rap thing that he does, you know?
[42:14.200 --> 42:15.060]  Where he just fucking...
[42:15.060 --> 42:15.260]  What?
[42:15.420 --> 42:19.720]  Just freestyles some bullshit that sounds like some shit but means nothing.
[42:20.180 --> 42:25.260]  You know, he did that for a little bit about Austin and competition and fucking soccer or something.
[42:25.280 --> 42:32.020]  I was looking at him down there on the pitch while he was dressed in green and slamming on his drum, and I just thought, that guy was an interstellar.
[42:32.020 --> 42:40.740]  Yeah, dude. Then he... Gavin's not kidding. He walked out on the pitch in a bright green suit. Like, a full suit.
[42:41.340 --> 42:45.920]  Which, by the way, brave to do, because you could green-screen anything on that dude.
[42:46.380 --> 42:47.820]  Like he won a golf tournament.
[42:48.180 --> 42:52.940]  Yeah. And then... yeah, like he won a golf tournament. Yeah, like he... yeah.
[42:53.120 --> 42:55.780]  And then he played the bongos.
[42:56.280 --> 42:56.500]  Okay.
[42:56.620 --> 42:57.360]  Like, seriously.
[42:57.360 --> 43:03.660]  It was just bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.
[43:03.980 --> 43:06.840]  For an eternity. And then we got to watch a soccer game. It was great.
[43:08.580 --> 43:09.480]  Did they win?
[43:09.900 --> 43:10.700]  Uh, they tied.
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.420]  The first game of the entire stadium, like, for real. And it was a nil-nil.
[43:16.860 --> 43:19.820]  Yeah, it was a pretty typical soccer game. It was a zero-zero.
[43:20.580 --> 43:20.860]  Wow.
[43:21.360 --> 43:24.780]  I was sat next to Millie, and the game ended, and she was like,
[43:25.160 --> 43:26.780]  Alright, so what, are we going to overtime or what?
[43:26.860 --> 43:28.580]  I was like, nah, that was it. We're going home.
[43:29.800 --> 43:31.180]  She was like, wait, that happens?
[43:31.420 --> 43:33.480]  I was like, oh yeah, that happens all the time.
[43:33.980 --> 43:36.680]  Makes it really exciting when there's a goal there.
[43:37.040 --> 43:39.880]  You have McConaughey on more drums and nobody scores.
[43:40.340 --> 43:41.360]  Yeah, disappointing evening.
[43:41.780 --> 43:43.980]  We had that mojo working for us and we still couldn't score.
[43:44.100 --> 43:48.240]  I gotta say, though, gorgeous stadium. Awesome that Austin finally has a pro team.
[43:48.780 --> 43:51.100]  Really cool experience getting to go to the first game.
[43:51.180 --> 43:53.720]  And it was awesome that Emily was able to put all that together for us.
[43:53.740 --> 43:54.660]  And I had a wonderful time.
[43:54.860 --> 43:58.300]  And I'm really glad that none of us broke anything.
[43:58.580 --> 44:02.300]  And there was no tornado or any kind of weather event.
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.000]  It gave me hope that maybe we could do it again someday.
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.640]  I mean, this all sounds fantastic.
[44:07.860 --> 44:09.940]  I feel like I missed what happened with the cucumber.
[44:10.120 --> 44:11.500]  Where's the cucumber coming into play?
[44:11.640 --> 44:12.280]  Did I miss that?
[44:12.440 --> 44:14.680]  Okay, so I pick... Gavin shows up at my house.
[44:15.060 --> 44:16.180]  And as we're driving, he goes,
[44:16.180 --> 44:18.080]  I had a weird thing happen today.
[44:18.240 --> 44:19.340]  And I go, what's that?
[44:19.400 --> 44:22.880]  And he goes, somebody chucked a load of pickles on my front door
[44:22.880 --> 44:26.420]  in a bag full of brine, like pickle brine.
[44:26.660 --> 44:29.600]  And I was like, you mean like a jar of LASIK pickles, full pickles,
[44:30.180 --> 44:33.400]  dumped into a freezer bag, ziplocked shut, like full of brine and pickles.
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.500]  And he was like, yeah, it's just on my front porch.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.820]  And then I was like, well, you have cameras, so let's look at the cameras.
[44:40.180 --> 44:43.860]  He pulls up, there's no... the pickles just show up on his front door camera.
[44:45.180 --> 44:49.140]  It's like, it's like they just get delivered by a hand that didn't have a body.
[44:49.560 --> 44:53.420]  You can just see them like slide into frame and there's no one there.
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.100]  So we talk about this all night while we're at the, we're having soccer fun, right?
[44:58.320 --> 45:02.180]  And, oh, and by the way, Gav, there was one thing going on that I never told you about
[45:02.180 --> 45:04.520]  that was distracting me all night, but I'll bring it up.
[45:04.980 --> 45:07.400]  So the whole ride back to Gavin's house, we're going to give him a ride home.
[45:07.480 --> 45:09.740]  We're like, do you think the pickles will be on the porch? Should we check?
[45:09.740 --> 45:16.980]  We get there, we run up, and there were three giant, dry-ass cucumbers in a Ziploc bag
[45:16.980 --> 45:20.320]  that obviously came from somebody's garden. There were pickles.
[45:20.920 --> 45:23.900]  I don't know how Gavin got there were pickles. There was no pickled brine.
[45:24.200 --> 45:28.520]  There was no brine of anything. It was just three cucumbers in a bag.
[45:28.920 --> 45:33.000]  In my defense, the bag was full of condensation, and I think I mistook it for...
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.800]  All I did, all I did really, there was a, you know, there was an Uber waiting.
[45:36.800 --> 45:42.400]  I just walked out my front door. I thought, that looks like a bag of pickles, as I stepped over them.
[45:42.520 --> 45:45.380]  And then I just continued walking. I didn't touch him. I didn't really look at him.
[45:45.780 --> 45:50.460]  And I was like, surely, surely there's, Emily's like, surely there was a note or something.
[45:50.460 --> 45:53.260]  And he's like, no, no, nothing. I walk up, I look at the cucumbers.
[45:53.980 --> 45:58.480]  I immediately identify they are not pickles. Look to the right, see the note, pick it up.
[45:58.660 --> 46:03.760]  It's like, hey, here's some cucumbers from the garden. If you don't need them, pass them on to the next neighbor. Thanks.
[46:05.620 --> 46:10.840]  It was more confusing at a glance. Everything made sense now that I had time to investigate.
[46:11.440 --> 46:19.520]  Also, when Gavin found the other footage, it got interesting. I will say that. He found footage from another camera that was fascinating.
[46:19.520 --> 46:29.200]  It was delivered, I guess, by an elderly woman who kind of looked like a witch out of Left 4 Dead.
[46:30.060 --> 46:43.720]  And she was like hobbling around and she like grabs the pole near the front of the house and kind of swings her arm around and just like slides it onto the bit that the camera can see.
[46:43.860 --> 46:48.840]  She like deliberately avoided going up the steps. She just reached around the railings and put it there.
[46:48.840 --> 46:51.960]  So it looked like from the doorbell that no one delivered it.
[46:52.220 --> 46:57.300]  Gavin was right when he texted it to me. He goes, she has advanced angles and he couldn't have been more true.
[46:57.900 --> 47:02.640]  Like she totally like Ethan hunted her way across his driveway.
[47:03.100 --> 47:10.040]  So he like hugged the wall. She was looking over her shoulder and looking around, trying to spot like, I don't know, threats.
[47:10.380 --> 47:17.640]  It was fucking fascinating. And then she just disappeared into the darkness from when she came. And she did look a little like a Left 4 Dead witch. He's not wrong there.
[47:17.640 --> 47:23.200]  And she came, like she didn't come from the street. It looked like she came out of my own garage somehow. I don't know where she came from.
[47:23.220 --> 47:28.060]  She came from your backyard or wherever. I assume she lives under the house. I don't know.
[47:28.220 --> 47:31.220]  Maybe they're my cucumbers and she just picked them for me.
[47:33.540 --> 47:39.400]  Either way, it's weird. I don't know what you want me to... I guess it's a kindness. It's like old lady kindness that doesn't exist anymore.
[47:39.660 --> 47:46.500]  But it is. I mean, I've never met this person. I've never expressed excitement for foreign cucumbers.
[47:46.900 --> 47:49.940]  Have you ever seen a Left 4 Dead witch hanging around your neighborhood?
[47:51.420 --> 47:55.140]  And to be honest, you know, at least pickle them for me or something. What do you want?
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.260]  Does she want me to eat them as cucumbers or does she want me to take them the rest of the way?
[47:59.660 --> 48:05.720]  I mean, you can do whatever you want. Yeah, I mean, you could do your given. What? What is the current? Do you still have them?
[48:05.840 --> 48:08.620]  Did you pass them on? What? What is? Where is? Where are the cucumbers?
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.440]  They were passed on. And I will say the note wasn't anywhere near the bag in my defense.
[48:14.440 --> 48:20.140]  Well, three feet from the bag. Well, I mean, put it was the only note on your porch, dude.
[48:20.440 --> 48:26.100]  It wasn't like it was hidden in amongst all the other notes. I saw it instantly. It was a yellow post-it note.
[48:28.460 --> 48:31.060]  All right, well, that's fair. You know, I'm in a hurry.
[48:31.600 --> 48:33.380]  That's true. You're in a hurry.
[48:33.380 --> 48:40.920]  The upside, though, the wasps that survived the fan, they're now happily living back inside the fan.
[48:41.040 --> 48:44.860]  And I've not turned it on since. And we're just coexisting peacefully. You'll be happy to know.
[48:45.160 --> 48:50.300]  That's great. I guess I am happy to know you decided to go that route instead of removing them.
[48:50.840 --> 48:53.140]  I mean, they've been in there a while by the looks of it.
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.460]  Did you talk in the last podcast about how the crows are throwing shit at you?
[48:57.460 --> 49:02.740]  Yeah, that was after the wasp, wasn't it? Yeah. I got like ravens or something.
[49:03.380 --> 49:06.940]  I don't know if it's a crow or a raven. I can never really tell. It's whatever the bird is that goes.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.080]  Right. Yeah. So they're in my trees and they just squawk at me every time they see me.
[49:16.200 --> 49:21.660]  If I walk into the backyard, they start screaming at me. And as soon as they can't see me, they stop.
[49:21.760 --> 49:25.260]  It's like peekaboo with a baby. You know, you get that immediate reaction.
[49:25.260 --> 49:32.300]  And if I'm under them, they'll flap about in the trees and snap branches off and throw them at me.
[49:32.840 --> 49:41.420]  He's not kidding. He showed me a video. It sounds impossible, but it is 100% obvious that they are attacking him.
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.840]  What have you done, Gavin? What curse? What has happened? Why is everything against you?
[49:46.840 --> 49:47.540]  I'm dead. I told you. I died.
[49:48.180 --> 49:52.540]  But does that explain the raven? Why would the raven crow attack you when you're dead?
[49:52.540 --> 49:54.180]  I don't know. They're just around.
[49:54.800 --> 49:59.900]  Maybe it was like they had babies they were trying to protect or something, but it's too late. It's too late in the year.
[50:00.080 --> 50:02.040]  I already had baby birds like three months ago.
[50:02.280 --> 50:05.060]  Are you an expert on the mating cycle of crows?
[50:05.060 --> 50:07.180]  Yes, I'm an expert on the crow mating cycle.
[50:08.180 --> 50:12.100]  Maybe you should have taken the cucumbers. Maybe they're a peace offering. Maybe that would have solved everything.
[50:13.200 --> 50:19.480]  Also, based on what you said, how did she get the note to the door? Did she make a paper plane and throw it?
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.620]  Was the note tied to the bag?
[50:24.980 --> 50:30.860]  I assume she did the weird railing move, the little stealth move, and slid all of it.
[50:30.980 --> 50:34.860]  And the note just blew off the bag, I assume, when the wind took it to the door.
[50:35.240 --> 50:40.040]  Yeah. I mean, that's a nice thing as an idea, but I don't want to have to carry the cucumber.
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.500]  I would end up eating the cucumbers out of purely, I don't want to take it to the next test.
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.940]  Would you eat a strange cucumber from someone you'd never met?
[50:47.940 --> 50:54.960]  If my options were eat strange cucumber from someone I've never met, or deliver it to the next house, I'm eating the strange cucumber.
[50:58.460 --> 51:01.220]  There's no other option. You wouldn't just throw it away.
[51:01.720 --> 51:06.480]  No. Well, I would never. That'd be a waste. But there needs to be a system on the note.
[51:07.020 --> 51:13.060]  You need to indicate, like, there needs to be a marking if you pass it on. I want to know how many houses this has gone through.
[51:13.060 --> 51:18.760]  How many blocks? This cucumber might not even be from my neighborhood. This could be three blocks over.
[51:19.040 --> 51:20.300]  They might not even be from her, yeah.
[51:20.600 --> 51:25.840]  Yeah, it would be crazy if it was from her. I'd be shocked. I assume this has gone to multiple doors.
[51:25.900 --> 51:31.000]  Oh, dude, what if it's like, it follows, and she just passed a curse on you. The curse of the cucumber.
[51:31.720 --> 51:36.060]  And that's why the birds are flipping out, and now you've passed it on. I hope. I hope you did it properly.
[51:36.060 --> 51:38.380]  Well, I'm glad I got rid of it before I didn't even touch him.
[51:38.380 --> 51:45.260]  Wow. Well, yeah, he's in the clear. It follows. The cucumber, it follows curse. The sequel we've always wanted.
[51:45.740 --> 51:52.340]  I love that the weirdness just comes from, like, the strange fruit, but Geoff, I think, was legitimately mad that there were cucumbers and not pickles.
[51:52.660 --> 51:58.460]  He was like, these aren't in brine! I was like, that's not the weird part, though. That's not the strangeness.
[51:58.680 --> 52:01.460]  You set it up all wrong. I was, I was phoned for it.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.140]  It's still weird.
[52:04.140 --> 52:09.920]  A bag of cucumbers from a garden is not as weird as a bag of pickles in brine.
[52:10.460 --> 52:11.860]  Why isn't that as weird?
[52:12.440 --> 52:16.320]  Who picked that? Come on, man. What do you mean?
[52:16.980 --> 52:19.020]  Is it just the act of, like, no one puts brine in a bag?
[52:19.020 --> 52:20.980]  You don't pickle shit in a bag, yeah.
[52:21.180 --> 52:22.860]  Yeah, yeah, you don't put brine in a bag. Okay.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.820]  Everyone knows this. You'd have to take it out of a jar, which is already a transportation method.
[52:26.820 --> 52:30.220]  I still think that only takes it from, like, a six weird to a seven, though.
[52:30.820 --> 52:39.920]  No, I feel like a bag of cucumbers is a five and is like pickles with brine in a Ziploc is like a solid eight.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.580]  Yeah, it's an eight. It's an easy eight.
[52:41.700 --> 52:44.380]  Really? It's a five to an eight? Eric, what are your thoughts?
[52:44.860 --> 52:49.980]  It's a huge gap because you have to take them out of the jar. It's just a weird thing.
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.480]  Yeah, I wanted to hear the rest of what Andrew had to say.
[52:53.140 --> 52:59.160]  Man, it really is. I just don't... you said that there was condensation inside the bag? Is that what you're saying?
[52:59.160 --> 53:02.320]  Yeah, that was the sheen I was looking at, I think, a little bit of moisture.
[53:02.660 --> 53:05.260]  A very small amount of condensation. I think he's overselling it.
[53:05.320 --> 53:07.300]  Well, it was more when I left, in fairness.
[53:07.300 --> 53:08.600]  Where did the condensation go?
[53:08.960 --> 53:10.100]  Maybe into the cucumber.
[53:11.760 --> 53:12.800]  I don't know.
[53:13.240 --> 53:18.980]  What does everyone want from me? I'm trying to just live my life. I've got bears showing up.
[53:20.760 --> 53:21.780]  That sounds great.
[53:22.160 --> 53:28.360]  I mean, I have to believe that this is a Jacob's Ladder situation.
[53:29.240 --> 53:31.180]  And you are dead.
[53:31.480 --> 53:37.080]  And we are... when people talk about simulation theory, or whatever, like, oh, we're just living in a simulation.
[53:37.420 --> 53:42.000]  I think that you died, or you're in a helicopter dying.
[53:42.360 --> 53:46.580]  And you are... we are just inside your head.
[53:46.780 --> 53:49.160]  And the woman is a demon.
[53:49.920 --> 53:54.960]  And the cucumbers represent you trying to get back to the earthly realm.
[53:55.920 --> 53:59.600]  Like, why did she look like a witch from a video game?
[53:59.720 --> 54:03.920]  Like, a dream half-remembered from a video game from, like, long ago?
[54:04.220 --> 54:07.700]  You know what I mean? Like, it's too many concentric circles.
[54:08.280 --> 54:11.760]  This is... I like where Eric is going with this.
[54:11.820 --> 54:15.900]  This is definitely... you are a Vietnam soldier, an American Vietnam soldier.
[54:16.140 --> 54:19.220]  You are bleeding out right now, and they are trying to save your life.
[54:19.360 --> 54:24.180]  And you're living the next 30 years in your mind, and we're just a part of it.
[54:24.180 --> 54:31.160]  Oh my god, and that lady that played the girl who turned into a demon, I think her name is Louise Pena, she died recently, too.
[54:31.560 --> 54:32.500]  So it's all unraveling.
[54:33.140 --> 54:33.540]  Interesting.
[54:34.060 --> 54:36.500]  Yeah, and she died, I think, of cirrhosis.
[54:37.580 --> 54:37.980]  Okay.
[54:38.500 --> 54:43.520]  I mean, in your head, I guess, because this is all invented by you.
[54:43.800 --> 54:44.860]  Oh, maybe she died of pickles!
[54:45.340 --> 54:46.300]  It will mean something.
[54:46.720 --> 54:49.760]  If it was a different vegetable, would you have been more excited about it?
[54:49.760 --> 54:55.320]  Is the issue of you not wanting it the weirdness of receiving it randomly?
[54:55.660 --> 55:00.240]  Or is it the fact that cucumber is a lower tier on the vegetable list?
[55:00.620 --> 55:02.080]  Where do you put cucumber on the vegetable list?
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.560]  I feel like no one ever needs cucumber, is the thing.
[55:06.860 --> 55:10.080]  Cucumber is always, like, an addition. It's never a main.
[55:10.580 --> 55:15.780]  And also, America has these weird stubby little cucumbers to make pickles with.
[55:15.780 --> 55:19.780]  The cucumbers I like to eat are the big, long ones. The ones that are, like, two feet long.
[55:20.180 --> 55:21.040]  Or a foot long.
[55:22.100 --> 55:23.960]  So I don't really know what I would have done with it.
[55:24.040 --> 55:28.800]  I mean, can you eat... do the cucumbers that turn into pickles taste the same as, like, an English cucumber?
[55:29.460 --> 55:29.700]  Yeah.
[55:29.980 --> 55:34.220]  I'd assume so. I mean, hey, you could put that in a salad. You've always got that as an option.
[55:35.580 --> 55:35.940]  Sandwiches?
[55:36.220 --> 55:37.520]  Cucumbers are fruit.
[55:37.780 --> 55:40.300]  I don't think a salad is a salad without cucumber, honestly.
[55:40.700 --> 55:41.060]  Really?
[55:41.420 --> 55:42.420]  It's a staple for me.
[55:42.800 --> 55:44.020]  Oh, I disagree strongly.
[55:44.460 --> 55:44.820]  Really?
[55:44.820 --> 55:45.460]  I disagree strongly.
[55:45.560 --> 55:47.720]  Oh, the cucumber, man. I could eat cucumber all day long.
[55:48.080 --> 55:50.680]  That's great, but I don't think they're needed for a salad.
[55:50.820 --> 55:54.700]  As I said, I feel like the salad is just the lettuce or the spinach or whatever you want to put.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.900]  It's the blank canvas, and then you put whatever you want into it.
[55:58.040 --> 55:59.700]  Yeah, why do you never make that, then?
[56:00.140 --> 56:00.720]  Who are you talking to?
[56:01.020 --> 56:03.220]  Well, why does Andrew never make the bulk standard salad?
[56:03.640 --> 56:10.380]  Well, I do. I just... I thought for... I wanted to make the greatest salad possible to enhance the cream, potentially.
[56:10.380 --> 56:16.220]  Or, like, I've never had this before. If I'm not going to like it in this salad, I'll never like it outside of it.
[56:16.560 --> 56:16.800]  Interesting.
[56:17.020 --> 56:17.240]  Slicing.
[56:17.560 --> 56:23.780]  You know what we should do? We should come up with... and I'm not saying we should do it right now, because we should put some thought into it.
[56:24.060 --> 56:32.800]  But we should pick, like, a number of ingredients, like, five or six or something, and then we all come up with the perfect salad in our minds, right?
[56:32.880 --> 56:40.960]  Like, you pick whatever six ingredients, and you create the perfect salad, I do, and then Gavin does the same, and then we can release it, and then let the audience decide which is the best salad.
[56:40.960 --> 56:41.380]  I see.
[56:41.420 --> 56:42.420]  Is this for the recipe book?
[56:42.760 --> 56:46.400]  Could be for the recipe book, yeah. And then we call that the ultimate, like, f***face salad or something.
[56:46.780 --> 56:48.640]  Do we have to do it anonymously?
[56:48.960 --> 56:50.160]  We would have to do it anonymously.
[56:50.500 --> 56:56.500]  I feel like salad has the greatest range. Salad can be amazing, and it can be such dogshit.
[56:56.800 --> 56:57.280]  Totally agree.
[56:57.280 --> 57:03.580]  It's a great, yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to think of what is a more ranged food. I think you might be right. I think it has the widest range.
[57:03.940 --> 57:10.440]  Whereas, like, stuff like eggs, eggs could be, like, okay or good, but that you... well, maybe that's a bad example.
[57:10.880 --> 57:17.480]  No, but I think it's a good example. It can also, it's an appetizer, or it's a meal, a main, however you want to present it. It's got a lot of flexibility.
[57:17.980 --> 57:18.160]  Yeah.
[57:18.240 --> 57:24.020]  I feel the same way about honey mustard. I feel like that's the condiment, wide range. There's such a variety of honey mustard flavors.
[57:24.700 --> 57:30.240]  More so than any other condiment, you can go place to place and have wildly different tasting experiences.
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.760]  I'd be willing to bet this is the fifth f*** face that you've mentioned honey mustard. You really like honey mustard.
[57:35.880 --> 57:37.880]  You really do. Yeah, it comes up a lot.
[57:37.920 --> 57:44.940]  Well, we did a sauce thing, and I don't know if I'd say it comes up a lot. What was the last mention of honey mustard when I wanted to make honey mustard?
[57:45.300 --> 57:48.240]  That was a long time ago. Like, probably 20, 30 episodes ago.
[57:48.320 --> 57:48.900]  No way.
[57:49.240 --> 57:50.200]  No, it's in the last 10.
[57:50.520 --> 57:50.560]  I disagree.
[57:50.560 --> 57:50.840]  It's in the last 10.
[57:50.840 --> 57:55.900]  You brought up things that have wide variety. I think honey mustard has wide variety. I was just trying to think of other food items.
[57:55.900 --> 57:57.980]  Yeah, next week I'm going to talk about something brown.
[57:59.020 --> 58:02.420]  Nobody's disagreeing. We're just pointing out that it comes up a lot.
[58:02.660 --> 58:07.860]  I don't feel like it does. I think it's just memorable when I bring it up. I think it's a great topic that everybody enjoys.
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.460]  We always engage really well in your honey mustard conversations.
[58:12.460 --> 58:19.800]  Yeah, you do. I always get a text after on those episodes, so that was a great show. So I'm trying to sprinkle a new honey mustard whenever I can. It really elevates.
[58:19.800 --> 58:21.400]  Much like the condiment.
[58:22.020 --> 58:26.360]  Yeah, it elevates the dish. It elevates the show. Little honey mustard talk.
[58:26.380 --> 58:30.300]  Do you think I should become a better neighbor and start dumping food on my neighbor's doorsteps?
[58:30.680 --> 58:32.140]  That's such a great question.
[58:32.300 --> 58:35.100]  I don't know what the cucumber rebuttal would be.
[58:35.440 --> 58:38.040]  Well, I think you get something that you grew in your own garden.
[58:38.440 --> 58:45.040]  I think you have... well, here's the problem. You don't know where she lives. Is she to your left or right? The last person that did it.
[58:45.220 --> 58:46.640]  She's from my garage.
[58:47.060 --> 58:48.140]  She came from under the house.
[58:50.060 --> 58:51.320]  She might be a Sleestack.
[58:54.780 --> 59:06.060]  I think... how do you do this in a way that isn't like an invasion of privacy? It'd be interesting to put one thing to the left of you, one thing to the right of you, and see how far it gets both ways.
[59:06.540 --> 59:10.040]  Do you like a race of sorts? I bet you...
[59:10.040 --> 59:17.620]  That is almost like a competition itself. We have to pick the shittiest vegetable we can think of and see how far it can get. And whoever gets the furthest wins.
[59:17.620 --> 59:21.080]  Like a game of vegetable telephone?
[59:21.700 --> 59:27.220]  Yeah, exactly. I would never pick... carrots or potatoes are not getting past two houses.
[59:27.440 --> 59:28.460]  Why? Because people are going to eat them?
[59:28.640 --> 59:32.600]  Yeah, people are going to like those items. Those are commonly used great vegetables.
[59:32.920 --> 59:40.200]  Does it have to be... can it be... I bet I could get a Branston pickle jar really far. I bet that would travel. No one's going to want that.
[59:40.200 --> 59:45.300]  No, people are going to throw that away because they don't trust it. They're just going to throw it onto the street.
[59:45.300 --> 59:47.280]  And it's like store-bought.
[59:47.680 --> 59:54.900]  Yeah, I don't think you can do store-bought. I think it has to be... it can't be fruit because it just bruises. It has to be like a vegetable with some durability.
[59:55.460 --> 59:59.920]  You're not going to fucking deal with apples in a bag, Geoff. Like, let's just... we can't do fruit.
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.780]  What about a swede?
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.060]  What's a swede?
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.120]  Yeah, what is that?
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.640]  That's a root veg, isn't it?
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.600]  No idea what it is. No clue. Never heard of it.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.420]  A Swedish person?
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.260]  Oh, let me see. A swede.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.700]  Swede veg.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.980]  Why do we talk about vegetables so much?
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.580]  I don't know. You bring it up every week.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.140]  It's a cross between a cabbage and a turnip.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.720]  Oh, you call it a rutabaga. What the hell?
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.200]  Hold on, hold on. Damn it, Andrew.
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:29.520]  Sorry.
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.700]  How were you going to say that?
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.660]  I got excited. It's the fun word.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:36.520]  I was going to say, it doesn't matter because Andrew told me that it's root... I was going to say rutabaga.
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.600]  What's a rutabaga?
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.280]  A rutabaga. It's a root vegetable.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.540]  It's a swede.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.980]  Wait, how do you spell your version?
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.640]  Write it out. I want to see what this looks like.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.840]  Because rutabaga...
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.120]  Yeah, that's a Swedish person.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.460]  That's a Swedish turnip, isn't it?
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.120]  I don't know if it's from Sweden. We just call it a swede.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:02.640]  It's a rutabaga.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.700]  A rutabaga is such a better name.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.880]  Where does that name come from?
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.720]  I don't know, but it's great. It's fun.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.320]  When you say rutabaga, you know what you're talking about. You don't have to go away.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.580]  I wouldn't. Some woman on the street would come up to me and say, I want to talk to you about rutabagas.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.320]  And I'd be like, cool, what's that? And she'd tell me to go shove it up my ass.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.280]  Rutabagas. I don't even think I like rutabagas, but it's just exciting to hear.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.200]  When I hear rutabagas in the mix, yeah, I'm amped about it. I want it.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.960]  Rutabagas is fucking awesome.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.000]  I don't know if I've had a rutabaga.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.140]  Okay. This comes from the Swedish dialectal word rotabagi.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.840]  From root and lump.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.300]  Root lump.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.100]  Dude, call it root lumps. That's way better than either.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.620]  Root lump is going to a different city. Nobody's touching root lump.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:11.200]  Yeah, I'm bagging up my root lumps and I'm putting them on the neighbor's doorstep and they're going far.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:19.720]  I wonder if you could have a vegetable so undesirable that it makes its way back to you.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.060]  Like all the way around the house?
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.960]  Like a circle, like all the way around the neighborhood.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.620]  It goes out to the left and it comes in from the right.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.460]  It can go north all the way to Texas.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:29.980]  Yeah.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.700]  Oh, my God. Do you know what's awesome about this episode?
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.880]  Because we have to do another one right after this.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.680]  And I was afraid we wouldn't have anything to talk about.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.740]  I didn't talk about any of my shit.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.860]  I had no idea we were going to go so heavy into rutabagas.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.360]  This is awesome.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.460]  We went from sleestacks to rutabagas.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.280]  Was it you, Geoff, who thought Andre 3000 was saying sleestacks in that song?
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.040]  Yeah, it still sounds like it to me.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.460]  Keep your heart three...
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.720]  Keep your heart, sleestack.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.000]  Keep your heart, sleestack. That's still how I sing it.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.940]  These girls are smart, sleestack.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.200]  Keep your heart, sleestack.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.100]  He's into science fiction and stuff.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.920]  We should wrap this up.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:15.700]  All right.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.580]  We've got to do one more.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.280]  Well, you've done it again.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.200]  You've listened to another hour of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.180]  An hour and five minutes today.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.560]  Hey, we appreciate that. Thanks for doing it.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.260]  Why would you say that?
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.740]  I mean, certainly it's going to get edited.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.440]  It's going to be less than what you just said.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.540]  Why would you call out the live time?
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.160]  Well, that's a good point.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.500]  We're definitely cutting out the jack shit.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.180]  That never happened.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.660]  The jack stuff is great.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.000]  I think it's even better that we cut him out.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:41.620]  He's going to be waiting.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.720]  But we should leave this bit in.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:47.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.460]  The part we referenced.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.060]  Absolutely.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:50.740]  All right.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.480]  Well, let's stop doing this.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.920]  The audience...
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.540]  Here's what's going to happen.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.120]  We're all going to stop.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:57.680]  Hit stop.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.740]  And then we're going to hit start.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.540]  And we're going to fucking do another podcast right now.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.280]  But you, you're going to go to wherever you listen to podcasts.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.920]  Probably like iTunes or Spotify or some shit.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.020]  And then you're going to enter in the longest, most verbose, most glowing review of F*** Face.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.740]  Or you won't.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.280]  I don't give a shit.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.000]  No, we do.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.300]  It'd be nice if you did.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.120]  We'd rather you did.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:18.660]  We do care.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.300]  That'd be nice.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.420]  Yeah, but I don't want to tell you what to do.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.200]  You do whatever you want to do.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.660]  No, you do what you want to do.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.320]  If the mood strikes you, write a review.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.300]  Give us some stars.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.440]  Maybe bag up some root vegetables and meet a neighbor.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.020]  You know?
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:29.500]  Yeah.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.120]  I don't know.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.740]  Maybe don't try to break into the Pentagon to put them on their front porch.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.780]  Maybe just walk up the steps that are there.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.860]  And don't be all secretive about it.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:41.560]  Or maybe do.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.420]  Freak them out.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.360]  I don't think you know that there's a difference between not giving a shit and being open to people doing what they want.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.820]  Those are two very different things.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.420]  I don't know.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:51.920]  Are they?
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.620]  I'm not their boss.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.180]  I can make suggestions, but I can't.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.420]  But then it's like, who am I to tell you what to do?
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.080]  You do whatever you want to do.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.440]  I mean, you are the host of the show.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:01.900]  You know what?
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.080]  We haven't had a show that wouldn't end properly in the whole of Season 2.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.540]  Oh, that's true.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:06.960]  We're back at it.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:07.980]  We've had the yelling.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.760]  I guess this is not...
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.700]  Year 2, not Season 2.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.360]  No, that's a good question, though.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.820]  We're definitely in Year 2, but have we had an episode that wouldn't end in Season 2?
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.400]  Season 2 is a little longer than Year 2.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:21.660]  I think so, because Season 2 has been going for over 20 episodes, I think.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.320]  Well, here, let me tease what I want to talk about next week.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.040]  I'd like to talk about...
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.560]  I had sort of a shit triangle happen in the last couple of days,
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:35.080]  but it has led me to a new understanding of my place in the universe.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.380]  And I'm pretty... I'm okay with it.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.380]  Are you dead as well?
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.620]  No, no, I'm not dead.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.740]  On the inside, maybe a little bit.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:45.580]  And you can find out more on the next episode of Face Goodbye!
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.240]  He's right.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.520]  And tune in next week when I'll talk about my tooth
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.760]  and what happened to my charger cheek,
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.180]  and I learned a new bite trick,
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.320]  and I'm a chain guy now.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.040]  Face out.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:56.860]  What?
