[00:34.780 --> 00:37.060]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.020]  So what I did, Eric, is I texted them the night before and I said,
[00:52.200 --> 00:54.780]  is this a regulation salad? Or is this salad approvable?
[00:54.840 --> 00:56.080]  It was a link to a Wendy's salad.
[00:56.460 --> 00:57.800]  They're like, yeah, it looks like a good salad.
[00:57.980 --> 01:00.440]  So then I used it and gavaged shit on the salad.
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.020]  But what I'm really glad they didn't notice is I actually swapped salads from that point.
[01:05.220 --> 01:09.220]  I picked a different salad than the one that you agreed on.
[01:09.340 --> 01:12.520]  And also, you didn't say, is this a regulation salad?
[01:12.700 --> 01:14.080]  Can I do salad cream on the salad?
[01:14.160 --> 01:16.300]  You just said, what do you think of this salad?
[01:16.620 --> 01:19.180]  Well, I wanted to save this. It's a surprise.
[01:19.480 --> 01:22.840]  I wanted to wait for the episode and then be like, we're doing this again.
[01:22.920 --> 01:24.460]  You've got strawberries in it.
[01:24.880 --> 01:25.640]  Well, yeah, okay.
[01:25.760 --> 01:28.320]  So here's the thing. I'm not, I don't really like blue cheese.
[01:28.320 --> 01:32.260]  And I didn't notice that in the salad I sent you to, blue cheese was in it.
[01:32.340 --> 01:34.940]  I was like, I don't really want to eat that.
[01:35.060 --> 01:37.100]  So I just audibled out, swap salad.
[01:37.260 --> 01:39.380]  So when you guys were yelling at me about the salad thing,
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.400]  I was waiting for one of you to bring up the fact that it was a completely different salad.
[01:42.980 --> 01:47.880]  It was a great salad though. And I still, I stand by, I gave you what you wanted and it wasn't good.
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.320]  And that's your fault, not mine.
[01:49.360 --> 01:50.500]  What salad are you doing this week?
[01:50.860 --> 01:51.600]  I don't have a salad.
[01:51.940 --> 01:54.180]  Okay. I'm not gonna, I've already redeemed myself in that way.
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.460]  He's just gonna have to chug another soda at the end, like we, as we discussed.
[01:57.460 --> 02:01.700]  Well, Geoff, I think maybe you should chug a soda for the first time, based on what people are saying.
[02:02.020 --> 02:03.100]  Nobody thinks you chugged a soda.
[02:03.240 --> 02:04.840]  It's just fucking easy to do.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.280]  It's just hard to burp later.
[02:06.540 --> 02:09.480]  I sent Gavin a video doing it to prove that it's not that hard.
[02:09.720 --> 02:10.500]  This is interesting.
[02:10.900 --> 02:13.260]  The audience can suck a butt because I definitely drank it.
[02:13.780 --> 02:14.540]  We're not ahead anymore.
[02:14.660 --> 02:18.280]  So that means that at the time of this, the audience has seen the previous episode.
[02:18.600 --> 02:20.440]  Yeah, I'm all fucked up.
[02:20.640 --> 02:22.540]  It's, we caught up and now I'm terrified.
[02:22.920 --> 02:25.800]  See, this is why, this is why we have a buffer.
[02:25.800 --> 02:30.860]  So that way, it just doesn't turn into more of this where Geoff is confused and mad.
[02:31.200 --> 02:33.060]  Let Geoff be mad about other stuff.
[02:33.420 --> 02:37.260]  Also, I hate when we have a buffer because then I never know where the fuck in the timeline I am.
[02:37.400 --> 02:39.720]  There's no way to win in recording this podcast, I realized.
[02:39.980 --> 02:44.420]  We need to talk about this because the, first of all, why do we not have a buffer?
[02:44.660 --> 02:46.100]  How long has this episode been going, by the way?
[02:46.480 --> 02:47.600]  Uh, well, I don't know.
[02:47.780 --> 02:48.440]  Hey, guess what?
[02:48.580 --> 02:50.180]  Geoff didn't record earlier.
[02:50.420 --> 02:51.260]  He took a while to record.
[02:51.300 --> 02:52.080]  I started it.
[02:52.140 --> 02:52.840]  I'm sorry.
[02:52.840 --> 02:54.760]  I started recording at 2.57.
[02:55.200 --> 02:55.640]  Wow.
[02:55.680 --> 02:56.840]  Yeah, mm-hmm.
[02:57.100 --> 02:57.360]  Okay.
[02:57.480 --> 02:58.800]  I had to get up and get a soda.
[02:58.920 --> 02:59.240]  That's fine.
[02:59.320 --> 02:59.700]  That's early.
[03:00.000 --> 03:00.600]  Thank you, Gavin.
[03:00.940 --> 03:02.240]  But why do we not have a buffer?
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.580]  We don't have a buffer because, uh, I don't know.
[03:06.800 --> 03:08.120]  We don't have a buffer.
[03:08.560 --> 03:17.240]  Yes, we do not have a buffer because you push, we weren't able to record because you were busy doing something for a different podcast.
[03:18.500 --> 03:21.680]  Well, yes, I was doing something for a different podcast.
[03:22.060 --> 03:26.720]  And, but, had I not been doing something for the podcast, I also would have been going to a funeral.
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.400]  So, uh, it was a double whammy for me that week.
[03:30.820 --> 03:30.960]  Yeah.
[03:31.020 --> 03:31.240]  Okay.
[03:31.280 --> 03:33.040]  Well, really take the air out of my punch, Geoff.
[03:33.180 --> 03:34.200]  Thank you for doing that.
[03:34.360 --> 03:37.500]  Thank you for just really making me have to, like, pull back.
[03:37.780 --> 03:38.760]  This isn't about that.
[03:39.000 --> 03:39.920]  The fact you were gone.
[03:40.160 --> 03:40.300]  What?
[03:40.560 --> 03:42.260]  I'm not even going to get into the semantics of it.
[03:42.320 --> 03:50.660]  The point of this is, I think, I think that we need to have a serious review over Superfan Jack and his superfan status.
[03:50.660 --> 03:52.180]  Oh, dude, don't worry.
[03:52.300 --> 03:53.140]  I'm right there with you.
[03:53.480 --> 04:01.080]  Guess who's, so tomorrow, we're, you know, if we want to place where this exists in the timeline, we are recording this at 3, it's 3.03 p.m.
[04:01.120 --> 04:04.900]  Central Time, June 24th, 2021.
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.300]  And tomorrow is the second f*** face break shit.
[04:09.840 --> 04:11.680]  And Jack has already backed out.
[04:12.160 --> 04:13.180]  Already backed out.
[04:13.360 --> 04:14.180]  He's already backed out.
[04:14.520 --> 04:17.960]  But, to Jack's credit, he backed out three days early.
[04:18.240 --> 04:18.880]  Yeah, that's true.
[04:18.880 --> 04:23.340]  I will give him all the credit in the world that he did not do it day of.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.180]  Yeah, he, so, he didn't do it moment of, which is appreciative.
[04:27.600 --> 04:33.560]  But I'm prepared, I'm prepared to hear any, any talk regarding demotion of said superfandom.
[04:33.740 --> 04:36.860]  I ratchet him back, back up as a show of good faith.
[04:36.860 --> 04:37.420]  I think he's nervous.
[04:37.940 --> 04:41.240]  I think he doesn't want to, I think he doesn't ever want to be in f*** face anything.
[04:41.580 --> 04:42.500]  It's a lot of pressure.
[04:42.840 --> 04:44.660]  We've talked about him so much as the superfan.
[04:44.980 --> 04:48.000]  He would have to deliver superfanness, and maybe he's not capable.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.620]  I don't see how we could continue to give him superfan status.
[04:51.800 --> 04:54.040]  He's 0 for 2 on these break shit streams.
[04:54.460 --> 04:56.200]  We have moved our podcast.
[04:56.340 --> 04:59.000]  We've not recorded our podcast for his podcast.
[04:59.480 --> 05:03.700]  I bought him a cameo from his favorite, his number one, his favorite person.
[05:04.060 --> 05:06.620]  I got him a cameo. We've done a lot for superfan Jack.
[05:06.660 --> 05:08.460]  I made him his own t-shirt.
[05:08.720 --> 05:10.160]  I've never made you a t-shirt.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.680]  I've never made Gavin a t-shirt.
[05:12.060 --> 05:13.400]  I don't think he can be superfan Jack.
[05:13.540 --> 05:16.240]  I think he's, he's gotta, we gotta, he's gotta go back to the minors.
[05:16.240 --> 05:18.500]  I'm not saying he can't work his way back up.
[05:18.680 --> 05:20.240]  What's he doing now? We could call him.
[05:20.580 --> 05:23.820]  We, uh, Minor League Jack is what we'll call it.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.360]  Yeah, I like Minor League Jack.
[05:26.200 --> 05:27.540]  I'm a fan of Minor League Jack.
[05:27.640 --> 05:29.180]  Should I call him right now? Yeah.
[05:29.560 --> 05:31.320]  Yeah, see if he can defend himself, I guess.
[05:31.340 --> 05:33.900]  Let me see if he'll answer. Uh, let's see.
[05:34.180 --> 05:38.900]  I mean, a real superfan would answer if, you know, his favorite podcast is true, I guess.
[05:39.540 --> 05:40.760]  A Minor League guy might not.
[05:40.860 --> 05:42.120]  I hope this is a good idea.
[05:42.120 --> 05:44.240]  Okay, here we go. Hold on, speaker.
[05:46.220 --> 05:48.080]  Can you guys hear that? Nope. No.
[05:48.500 --> 05:50.680]  Much like the Soda Shack, nonexistent. Jack?
[05:50.680 --> 05:55.020]  Geoffrey. Hey, it's Geoff, uh, you, Geoff from, uh, the F*** Face podcast.
[05:55.420 --> 06:01.120]  You're on my podcast F*** Face right now with, with me, with, uh, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[06:01.220 --> 06:02.680]  Do you have a, just one second, Jack?
[06:03.060 --> 06:04.880]  Oh, no, no, this is, this is overwhelming.
[06:04.940 --> 06:08.540]  Oh my gosh, yes, yes, I'm excited to be on your podcast F*** Face.
[06:09.580 --> 06:11.740]  Andrew, were you able to hear that? Jack's very excited to be here.
[06:12.040 --> 06:14.380]  I didn't hear anything. I can't hear a thing. It's going into the microphone.
[06:14.500 --> 06:15.480]  It's going straight into the microphone.
[06:15.580 --> 06:17.700]  I don't know how you can't hear it. I can't hear Andrew.
[06:17.800 --> 06:19.680]  I feel like this is as made up as your soda.
[06:20.080 --> 06:21.520]  No, no, no, it's questionable at best.
[06:21.660 --> 06:23.300]  It's, what the f***? Hold on a second, Jack.
[06:23.400 --> 06:25.640]  What the f*** am I supposed to do? How do I pipe it into you, dickhead?
[06:25.700 --> 06:27.100]  I'm going, it's going into the microphone.
[06:27.300 --> 06:28.940]  I can't help it if you can't f***ing hear it.
[06:29.120 --> 06:31.120]  He's here. Jack, can you hear? I turned your mic up, fool.
[06:31.980 --> 06:35.640]  It's up. Your mic is all the way up. I can't hear Gavin either.
[06:35.880 --> 06:38.000]  It's always all the way up. I always got, hold on a second.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.640]  Hold on a second, Jack. Hold on just one second.
[06:40.500 --> 06:43.100]  Notice Gavin Geoff said my part. Jack, yell hey.
[06:44.200 --> 06:46.580]  Hello, this is Jack. Oh, that's Jack.
[06:46.860 --> 06:50.500]  We can kind of hear. This is Jack. I'm here. I'm a big fan of the podcast.
[06:50.740 --> 06:53.420]  Can't hear. Yeah, okay. He's f***ing blowing out my microphone.
[06:53.800 --> 06:56.080]  All right, Andrew wanted me to relay something to you.
[06:56.380 --> 06:57.920]  So since you can't relay it. It's a bit loud, Jack.
[06:58.260 --> 07:00.920]  Well, I got to turn my game back down. It's absurdly loud.
[07:02.300 --> 07:03.940]  Andrew, what did you want me to say to Jack?
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.060]  I just said that I think he can't be a super fan right now.
[07:07.060 --> 07:13.320]  I think he's going back to the minors. Jack, Andrew has pulled f***face rank as 33% of f***face.
[07:14.240 --> 07:15.920]  I didn't pull rank. It's more of a conversation.
[07:16.440 --> 07:20.760]  He said, he put his foot down and said that you've been stripped of your super fan title
[07:21.640 --> 07:24.060]  and that you're now minor leagues fan, Jack.
[07:24.160 --> 07:25.820]  You have to work your way back up through the minors.
[07:26.300 --> 07:29.940]  I, a liar. Can't hear him.
[07:30.400 --> 07:32.920]  Okay, well, Jack, this has gone terribly wrong.
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.660]  I'm going to hang up on you now, but I will relay that message.
[07:37.020 --> 07:41.340]  I like we're talking about someone who we talk to on Discord daily.
[07:41.540 --> 07:44.380]  And we can't just have him join the Discord for five seconds.
[07:44.560 --> 07:45.640]  I don't know why you didn't do that.
[07:46.220 --> 07:46.860]  Me? What?
[07:46.920 --> 07:50.100]  Well, why didn't you have him join the Discord then if you've got all the f***ing ideas?
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.040]  How am I? What?
[07:52.120 --> 07:55.480]  Could I point out Geoff's podcast, Gavin? Did you hear that?
[07:55.720 --> 07:59.120]  On my podcast, Geoff said. What happened to the triangle, Geoff?
[07:59.120 --> 08:01.960]  And then I said you're 33% of the f***ing thing.
[08:02.100 --> 08:03.020]  No, no you didn't.
[08:03.020 --> 08:06.300]  I did just say I said Andrew is 33% of the podcast.
[08:06.780 --> 08:11.440]  Oh my God, it is my podcast and it's your podcast and it's Gavin's podcast.
[08:11.540 --> 08:12.680]  You own a little piece of it.
[08:13.000 --> 08:14.080]  It's a little piece of yours.
[08:14.160 --> 08:15.200]  You can call it yours.
[08:15.660 --> 08:17.540]  Speaking of, you know, like hosting duties.
[08:17.700 --> 08:18.680]  Welcome to f***face.
[08:18.820 --> 08:20.240]  I don't know what episode this is.
[08:20.620 --> 08:22.560]  Hello and welcome to episode 57.
[08:22.620 --> 08:23.920]  I believe of f***face.
[08:24.040 --> 08:24.720]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[08:24.900 --> 08:25.320]  I'd be willing.
[08:26.080 --> 08:27.240]  Well, now you're interrupting the intro.
[08:27.760 --> 08:28.700]  Yeah, it's too late.
[08:28.760 --> 08:30.480]  The intro, this is like 28 minutes in.
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.400]  I'm willing to give up 1% of the triangle.
[08:33.640 --> 08:39.480]  I want to take 32% of the podcast and split the remaining percent equally between Eric and Nick.
[08:39.740 --> 08:40.580]  I think that's a great idea.
[08:40.900 --> 08:43.520]  If I gave you my sauce, Gavin, could I just buy your shares?
[08:43.660 --> 08:44.920]  Could I become the majority owner?
[08:45.420 --> 08:49.060]  Yeah, my percentage of f***face is totally for sale.
[08:49.420 --> 08:52.420]  I'm willing to trade any amount of it, to be honest.
[08:52.600 --> 08:53.260]  I'll take the sauce.
[08:53.700 --> 08:53.960]  Okay.
[08:54.500 --> 08:54.940]  It's a lot.
[08:55.040 --> 08:58.580]  Hey, the sauce is valuable, like more valuable than I anticipated.
[08:59.180 --> 09:00.540]  Market value is up.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.260]  The sauce is no longer available.
[09:02.480 --> 09:05.680]  Can no longer get it in McDonald's outside of Korea.
[09:05.880 --> 09:07.860]  I think those are standard sauces there.
[09:08.020 --> 09:08.880]  Have you made any sales?
[09:09.180 --> 09:10.640]  Have not made any sales.
[09:10.900 --> 09:12.600]  I made an alliance with Nick.
[09:12.940 --> 09:15.140]  We've officially formed a sauce alliance.
[09:15.780 --> 09:17.120]  And I've been searching.
[09:17.340 --> 09:18.660]  I've been tapping into the market, Gavin.
[09:19.180 --> 09:20.560]  I've been asking around.
[09:21.060 --> 09:22.980]  I don't know if you saw this, but I reached out.
[09:23.040 --> 09:25.600]  I asked McDonald's if they would be interested in buying the sauces.
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.580]  So immediately, day one, you're trying to sell it all back to the place that made it.
[09:29.740 --> 09:32.060]  Yeah, well, I figured, you know, it was a big hit for them.
[09:32.540 --> 09:34.140]  They could use the sauce.
[09:34.300 --> 09:35.540]  They could use some additional sauces.
[09:35.740 --> 09:38.120]  I'm sure there's a lot of people are saying they couldn't get them.
[09:38.520 --> 09:39.260]  They're running low.
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.420]  I mean, surely a different, like surely Burger King wants it more than McDonald's.
[09:43.500 --> 09:44.500]  McDonald's can just make more.
[09:44.860 --> 09:47.840]  Well, that's what you're, you know, well, listen, they need to make it though.
[09:47.900 --> 09:48.640]  They need to ship it.
[09:48.680 --> 09:49.700]  They need to distribute it.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.440]  I'm ready to go.
[09:50.620 --> 09:52.640]  I got my sauce tower set.
[09:53.200 --> 09:53.680]  I'm ready.
[09:54.120 --> 09:55.100]  That was my idea.
[09:55.100 --> 09:56.300]  I also, I just didn't know.
[09:56.420 --> 09:57.620]  I was curious how they'd reply.
[09:57.820 --> 09:59.700]  I just wanted to see what McDonald's would do.
[09:59.960 --> 10:00.800]  And what did they say?
[10:01.380 --> 10:04.560]  So I tweeted, hi, McDonald's, and I included McDonald's Canada.
[10:04.620 --> 10:05.820]  You got to cover all your bases.
[10:06.260 --> 10:09.660]  Now that the BTS meal is gone, I hear you could use some sauce.
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.620]  I'm an honorable man simply looking to unload an empire in exchange for my liquid gold.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.840]  How about free nuggets for the rest of the year?
[10:17.040 --> 10:18.960]  I eagerly await your response.
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.620]  Hashtag the sauce boss, which I didn't know, I guess, is the nickname of the epic mealtime guy.
[10:24.620 --> 10:25.460]  That's Harley.
[10:25.740 --> 10:25.860]  Yeah.
[10:26.260 --> 10:27.260]  Yeah, I didn't know that.
[10:27.420 --> 10:31.280]  He liked the tweet relating to somebody calling him awesome in exchange for that.
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.000]  So then, McDonald's America, quiet.
[10:36.260 --> 10:38.280]  McDonald's Canada, wild response.
[10:38.820 --> 10:39.320]  Quick mass.
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.140]  81 sauces.
[10:41.760 --> 10:42.580]  Is that right?
[10:42.660 --> 10:43.200]  Have you verified?
[10:43.540 --> 10:46.240]  It's, yeah, I can verify it's more than 81.
[10:46.580 --> 10:48.160]  I don't know where 81 came from.
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.060]  Well, I assume they counted the length, the width, and the height.
[10:52.300 --> 10:53.100]  It's basic volume.
[10:53.840 --> 10:54.800]  It's way more than that.
[10:54.900 --> 10:57.220]  We got a 405 sauce thing.
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.060]  I was kind of disappointed, to be honest.
[10:59.060 --> 11:01.960]  Then they did another tweet that, like, they acknowledged it was 405.
[11:02.280 --> 11:05.020]  Oh, they just... it's just terrible maths.
[11:05.280 --> 11:07.980]  Yeah, they did a second one where they're like 405.
[11:08.100 --> 11:09.100]  They're just wildly wrong.
[11:09.300 --> 11:10.540]  They did say quick math.
[11:10.900 --> 11:11.860]  That is correct math.
[11:12.580 --> 11:14.660]  And it's also, they're not a math company.
[11:15.040 --> 11:16.460]  They make nuggets and burgers.
[11:17.340 --> 11:18.720]  I don't expect a lot from them.
[11:19.120 --> 11:20.080]  But no response.
[11:20.840 --> 11:22.120]  So then I followed up.
[11:22.120 --> 11:23.940]  I extended my offer.
[11:24.220 --> 11:26.500]  I gave an even bigger offer for my second go-around.
[11:26.860 --> 11:34.000]  Did a second tweet the following day informing McDonald's that our exclusive negotiating window is now closed.
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.160]  I respect you, so... I can't even read this.
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.920]  I respect you, so the offer stands.
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.760]  But Big Sauce doesn't wait.
[11:42.960 --> 11:44.100]  The sauce game is ongoing.
[11:44.240 --> 11:45.700]  You cannot pause for the sauce game.
[11:45.700 --> 11:52.100]  I now kindly extend my BTS sauce empire for free nuggets offer to Wendy's and Burger King.
[11:52.260 --> 11:54.480]  Don't sleep on this chance at liquid gold.
[11:55.100 --> 11:56.800]  Hashtag clear eyes full sauce can't lose.
[11:57.100 --> 12:02.380]  I have stacked my nugget containers and one of the drink things I got.
[12:03.080 --> 12:03.960]  Actually, I forgot.
[12:04.260 --> 12:06.060]  So they didn't reply to this.
[12:06.220 --> 12:08.920]  So I don't know if they're, you know, they're probably having business meetings.
[12:09.180 --> 12:12.120]  They're probably trying to work out a counter offer, I assume.
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.420]  I've yet to hear back from Wendy's, Burger King, or McDonald's America.
[12:17.940 --> 12:21.220]  But I forgot to mention this and just talking about this brings this up.
[12:21.680 --> 12:26.040]  The first day the sauce ended, the BTS sauce expired, the deal.
[12:26.320 --> 12:28.540]  Or not the deal, but their offering of it. The 21st.
[12:28.840 --> 12:30.820]  I woke up. I went downstairs.
[12:30.960 --> 12:34.540]  I walked outside. I had a bag of McDonald's at my front door.
[12:35.240 --> 12:36.780]  Just a bag.
[12:37.040 --> 12:38.740]  Yeah, so I was like, what is this?
[12:39.240 --> 12:40.180]  I didn't order this.
[12:40.620 --> 12:41.480]  So I pulled it in.
[12:41.580 --> 12:42.180]  I looked at it.
[12:42.280 --> 12:45.920]  It came from the night before. It was placed at 1036 p.m.
[12:45.940 --> 12:47.260]  or that's when the receipt was printed.
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.500]  It was delivered to my front door using one of the delivery apps,
[12:52.600 --> 12:56.720]  but not when I use. A different delivery app delivered it to my door.
[12:56.900 --> 12:59.040]  Which then, so there's two scenarios in my mind.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.760]  Either the McDonald's hates me for all the sauce orders.
[13:05.100 --> 13:07.380]  And as a source of revenge,
[13:07.380 --> 13:10.960]  they waited until the evening of the final day that the sauce is available
[13:11.420 --> 13:16.020]  and sent me like either fucked with like it was the order was a medium fries,
[13:16.060 --> 13:18.620]  a large fries, a BLT quarter pounder.
[13:19.180 --> 13:21.900]  And that was oh and a soda, a medium soda.
[13:22.320 --> 13:25.380]  So either I feel like they sent it to me and they fucked with me.
[13:25.580 --> 13:27.880]  Like they did something to the soda and just thinking like,
[13:27.960 --> 13:29.860]  oh, they'll think free food and they'll have it.
[13:30.320 --> 13:36.000]  Or I have had so many McDonald's orders recently that the driver just assumed
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.180]  I was the person who placed it. They just delivered it there.
[13:39.620 --> 13:43.260]  But it's a different app, but I had rogue McDonald's showed.
[13:43.320 --> 13:49.060]  I felt like it was like a warning. Like it was a it was a threat or like a declaration of war.
[13:49.240 --> 13:51.780]  I did not see that when I sent those tweets out.
[13:52.060 --> 13:57.800]  Interesting, interesting that you that's how you view it and not as a peace offering from McDonald's to you.
[13:58.060 --> 14:02.060]  Here are some other fine products we offer that you might enjoy.
[14:02.480 --> 14:04.840]  I feel like a peace offering would be more sauce.
[14:04.840 --> 14:07.540]  Yeah, I was going to say I think that would be the true peace offering.
[14:07.940 --> 14:12.020]  I don't think burgers that looked gross and two orders of fries.
[14:12.320 --> 14:14.580]  Now you're insulting them. It was a gross burger.
[14:14.620 --> 14:16.500]  Andrew, I think you're slightly overwhelmed.
[14:16.780 --> 14:19.080]  I think you're in all kinds of directions at once.
[14:19.200 --> 14:21.900]  I don't think you truly know what you want to do with this sauce.
[14:22.860 --> 14:27.600]  I agree. Well, it's yeah. No, I don't. It's worth a lot though.
[14:28.180 --> 14:32.540]  Like it's I sent you the listing of like a hundred dollars for one sauce of each
[14:32.540 --> 14:36.640]  and like the container in a bag. So what was that?
[14:36.700 --> 14:39.600]  Was that the packaging or was that the actual sauce? That was everything.
[14:39.960 --> 14:43.780]  It was I think two sauce containers and it was the nugget box.
[14:43.960 --> 14:45.920]  The listing I shared that was like a hundred dollars.
[14:46.140 --> 14:52.340]  Have you have you been drinking heavily recently or taking any kind of medication or drugs?
[14:52.840 --> 14:56.440]  Are you on any like heroin or any kind of mind-altering drugs right now?
[14:56.440 --> 14:59.680]  I'm straight edge Geoff. There's no way you could have gotten hammered
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.080]  or like I don't know did some black car heroin and ordered it yourself.
[15:04.420 --> 15:10.620]  No, because it's not even an app. I use it was a different delivery system than I would ever use.
[15:10.860 --> 15:12.500]  They don't even have my address for the other.
[15:12.900 --> 15:18.180]  So I think I honestly think what most likely happened is they saw McDonald's order this building
[15:18.180 --> 15:22.620]  and just took it to my door, but my door is so hard to find like it's impressive
[15:22.620 --> 15:25.200]  that it reached me out of all the places.
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.140]  I love that you you describe your door like it's like it's magic
[15:30.140 --> 15:31.740]  and it exists in the Harry Potter universe
[15:31.740 --> 15:36.100]  and you have to walk by it at a certain time of day or do an incantation to discover it.
[15:36.460 --> 15:38.700]  He has the sewing machine towards the wall the right angle.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.460]  We've talked about doing a bathtub race thing at some point Geoff.
[15:44.580 --> 15:48.100]  If you are ever where I live, I will not give you instructions.
[15:48.260 --> 15:51.960]  I'll just tell you the address of my building and we'll see how long it takes you to find my door.
[15:51.960 --> 15:53.480]  It is not easy.
[15:53.940 --> 15:56.100]  Gavin, you're involved with that too, buddy.
[15:56.500 --> 15:57.400]  Challenge accepted.
[15:57.740 --> 15:58.920]  All right, that sounds awesome.
[15:59.460 --> 16:00.180]  And I got news for you.
[16:00.320 --> 16:02.420]  I got there. We're definitely going to do the bathtub race,
[16:02.520 --> 16:06.340]  but there's another reason we might end up in Canada for face down the road.
[16:06.820 --> 16:13.780]  And so there's two possibilities in the next year that I could bring us to your wonderful fine Island.
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.900]  I didn't to the island specifically not even just general.
[16:18.220 --> 16:20.120]  Well to the country, but if I'm going to go to the country,
[16:20.120 --> 16:23.360]  I'm going to make the additional effort to go to your home turf.
[16:23.780 --> 16:24.320]  This is exciting.
[16:24.440 --> 16:27.780]  I don't I haven't heard what the other possible is it too far out to talk about?
[16:28.220 --> 16:31.860]  I'm guess I just I just it would be better be more fun for me not to tell you.
[16:32.060 --> 16:34.880]  Okay. Well, wait, so I just you're going to show up one day.
[16:34.920 --> 16:37.260]  Is that now? I'll tell I'll tell you in good time.
[16:37.980 --> 16:40.460]  Okay. I just don't see the point in telling you now.
[16:40.840 --> 16:43.200]  It'll be night like next year sometime maybe a year from now.
[16:43.320 --> 16:45.580]  You're in two months. You're in or so.
[16:45.640 --> 16:47.460]  Okay, potentially. Okay. Hmm.
[16:47.460 --> 16:49.960]  That's concerning and then I'm going to find your door.
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.620]  I don't think you will I think you're going to end up having to text me to try to figure out like instructions.
[16:56.300 --> 16:57.940]  I'd be impressed if you found it.
[16:58.060 --> 17:01.720]  I would I don't know what there should we should make a bet of some kind.
[17:01.860 --> 17:03.920]  I bet you could not from the front of my building.
[17:04.260 --> 17:06.500]  You could not find my door within two minutes.
[17:06.680 --> 17:08.660]  Here's how I would do it within two minutes.
[17:08.960 --> 17:11.900]  Here's how I would do it. I would order McDonald's to your house
[17:12.440 --> 17:13.900]  and then I would start the timer.
[17:13.900 --> 17:17.280]  I would start the two-minute timer as soon as the guy showed up and I just follow him.
[17:17.840 --> 17:20.020]  He knows how to get there. We've established that.
[17:20.540 --> 17:22.500]  He knows how to get there with your orders with other people's orders.
[17:22.760 --> 17:24.920]  He's the key to me finding your place instantly.
[17:25.100 --> 17:28.840]  I have no fit cost me a 99 cents in a delivery fee.
[17:29.080 --> 17:31.860]  I'll order some small fries and he'll take me right there.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.560]  Do maps Google Maps or anything does it just put it in the wrong place on the map puts in the wrong place?
[17:36.740 --> 17:39.660]  Yeah puts in the wrong place. How do the drivers find it then?
[17:39.660 --> 17:44.000]  It's well on one of the apps I can manually and they've changed this.
[17:44.140 --> 17:46.280]  So it's I don't think I'll be making many food orders anymore.
[17:46.420 --> 17:48.700]  You could manually place where you want them to drive
[17:49.100 --> 17:51.440]  and I'd kind of put them in the middle of nowhere essentially.
[17:52.860 --> 17:57.280]  But even still like people would get lost all the time or like I'd get some of the photos.
[17:57.420 --> 18:00.600]  I've gotten if we've left your order here is like they've clearly given up
[18:00.600 --> 18:02.740]  and they don't know what to do. It's just an alley.
[18:03.100 --> 18:05.500]  Yeah, it's just in a corner somewhere of the building.
[18:05.500 --> 18:10.160]  It's it's great. I bet I can find it within two minutes.
[18:10.260 --> 18:13.400]  I bet I can do it. I don't think so.
[18:13.500 --> 18:19.020]  Well, it's dependent. It's well, we should do it like a survivor challenge nearly home.
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.180]  Isn't home where we all want to be Reba here for realtor.com.

[19:49.720 --> 19:53.640]  Building that sauce tower is the most survivor-like experience I've ever had.
[19:53.740 --> 19:57.400]  It was genuinely like my hand was shaky. Everything was like wobbly.
[19:57.400 --> 20:00.620]  It felt like one of those like they gotta stack it above the point things.
[20:00.800 --> 20:03.060]  It was terrifying. Oh, man.
[20:08.130 --> 20:12.830]  Summer's here and the living ain't easy if you've got swamp ass.
[20:13.030 --> 20:15.890]  I feel like maybe I should have sung that but I'm not going to.
[20:16.290 --> 20:23.710]  However, I will say that how you stay on top of your sweaty bottom in these hot summer months is important
[20:23.710 --> 20:29.210]  and I would recommend trying a refreshing spray from a Hello Tushy bidet.
[20:29.710 --> 20:36.250]  Keep your sweaty crack clean all summer long with the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 modern bidet attachment.
[20:36.410 --> 20:43.830]  It is stylish. It is eco-friendly and it is a refreshing little shower purely for your butthole.

[22:47.270 --> 22:49.310]  Have you ever had to find something in a hurry?
[22:49.730 --> 22:52.670]  Yeah, like airport gates, you know, like when you're transferring.
[22:53.030 --> 22:54.270]  I think it's the worst combination.
[22:54.450 --> 22:59.790]  Yeah, it's so bad when everyone, like someone's counting on you or you're going to miss something,
[23:00.250 --> 23:03.570]  but you don't know where to look for the thing you're looking for.
[23:03.750 --> 23:08.530]  You kind of end up like frantically jolting around in all directions, like looking at shit.
[23:08.750 --> 23:11.030]  And you want to be moving fast, but you don't have a direction.
[23:11.170 --> 23:13.610]  So you're just like stuttering around.
[23:13.870 --> 23:15.230]  Yeah, it's a frantic mess.
[23:15.230 --> 23:16.730]  I'm trying to think of other times.
[23:16.890 --> 23:20.570]  I think airports are really like the one time where it's like, I don't know where this gate is.
[23:20.650 --> 23:21.490]  I have 10 minutes.
[23:21.890 --> 23:22.550]  What am I going to do?
[23:22.690 --> 23:24.750]  I was once in Spain.
[23:24.930 --> 23:26.670]  We're filming some Formula One or something.
[23:26.830 --> 23:32.550]  And I realized that the guy I was with didn't bring the mags for the camera.
[23:32.730 --> 23:34.010]  They were still in his hotel room.
[23:34.650 --> 23:37.470]  So I had to be, I like, I was like, oh, I'll go back and get him.
[23:37.810 --> 23:42.090]  And one of the runners like drove me back to the little resort where we were staying.
[23:42.090 --> 23:45.290]  And we'd already had, we had a shot in the camera.
[23:45.550 --> 23:46.530]  We just couldn't save it.
[23:46.590 --> 23:49.510]  So everything was waiting on us to download this shot.
[23:50.050 --> 23:51.990]  And I was ran back into this resort.
[23:52.070 --> 23:54.810]  It was like a little compound of maybe like 50 villas.
[23:55.530 --> 23:56.990]  But I got lost.
[23:57.330 --> 23:59.310]  I could, I'd only seen it in the dark.
[23:59.450 --> 24:01.230]  And I, it was like confusing me.
[24:01.230 --> 24:02.730]  It was confusing me during the day.
[24:02.870 --> 24:05.510]  So I was like, oh, where's the, and I couldn't find the number.
[24:05.610 --> 24:06.670]  And I was just running around.
[24:06.670 --> 24:12.570]  I must have spent five minutes running full speed, but not knowing where I was running.
[24:12.850 --> 24:16.570]  I must have looked like a completely insane person, like a chicken with his head cut off.
[24:16.850 --> 24:17.770]  And I was freaking out.
[24:17.850 --> 24:19.230]  I thought I was going to black out by the end of it.
[24:19.290 --> 24:22.530]  I was like, everyone's waiting, everyone's waiting.
[24:22.890 --> 24:25.910]  And eventually I found it and it was like really close to the entrance.
[24:27.870 --> 24:32.850]  That's, I, I keep getting, so like this is a weird, like it wasn't super frantic.
[24:33.270 --> 24:35.170]  I got lost in Austin one time.
[24:35.170 --> 24:36.990]  I don't think I've told the story on the podcast.
[24:37.230 --> 24:38.630]  Is this pre or post ankle roll?
[24:39.150 --> 24:42.190]  This is, I, this is pre ankle roll.
[24:42.430 --> 24:43.730]  My ankle is fine at this point.
[24:44.110 --> 24:47.290]  I have two distinctive lost in Austin stories.
[24:47.430 --> 24:49.010]  It always seems to happen at around RTX.
[24:49.210 --> 24:50.630]  I guess that's the main reason why I'm in Austin.
[24:51.190 --> 24:52.630]  But it was the night.
[24:52.690 --> 24:56.550]  I am like one of the 12 people that didn't mind True Detective season two.
[24:57.070 --> 25:01.390]  And it was the finale was on like the closing night of RTX.
[25:01.390 --> 25:05.630]  And Caleb invited me to this bar thing where I guess they'd like every year.
[25:05.730 --> 25:07.810]  They'd like a bunch of people would get together in the community.
[25:08.230 --> 25:09.810]  Do like a community event at this place.
[25:10.090 --> 25:14.470]  And it was like maybe two blocks away from where I was staying the hotel I was at.
[25:14.590 --> 25:21.850]  And this guy that I met through the community really wanted to play rock-paper-scissors against me for whatever reason.
[25:22.350 --> 25:24.050]  And I was like meet me.
[25:24.170 --> 25:26.090]  I'll meet you outside of this hotel.
[25:26.450 --> 25:30.650]  We can play rock-paper-scissors and we can walk and talk to this bar that I have to go to.
[25:30.650 --> 25:31.650]  So that's what we did.
[25:31.730 --> 25:32.690]  I won by the way.
[25:33.010 --> 25:35.570]  Do you play rock-paper-scissors a lot with a lot of people?
[25:35.710 --> 25:36.610]  I don't play rock.
[25:36.710 --> 25:37.730]  No, it was their thing.
[25:37.810 --> 25:39.530]  They really wanted to play rock-paper-scissors.
[25:39.770 --> 25:40.730]  I was like sure, I'll play.
[25:40.830 --> 25:43.530]  I just love the idea of you and someone else in an alley.
[25:43.650 --> 25:44.630]  The police roll up.
[25:44.750 --> 25:46.450]  It's like alright, where's the drugs?
[25:46.650 --> 25:48.890]  And it's like no sir, we were just playing rock-paper-scissors.
[25:49.210 --> 25:50.410]  Don't worry about it.
[25:50.450 --> 25:51.010]  It's normal.
[25:52.230 --> 25:53.110]  I'm very competitive.
[25:53.310 --> 25:54.790]  So I luckily I won.
[25:54.850 --> 25:55.630]  I think it was close.
[25:55.690 --> 25:56.830]  I think he won the first one.
[25:56.870 --> 25:57.670]  I won the next three.
[25:57.730 --> 25:58.670]  I don't remember exactly.
[25:58.670 --> 26:00.450]  But then we walked and talked to the place.
[26:00.790 --> 26:01.770]  And I stayed.
[26:01.930 --> 26:02.690]  I just hung out.
[26:02.790 --> 26:03.770]  I didn't really do anything.
[26:03.870 --> 26:07.310]  I played pinball mainly for like two or three hours at this party.
[26:07.530 --> 26:09.470]  Do you think you're good at rock-paper-scissors?
[26:09.670 --> 26:10.910]  Like better than the average person?
[26:11.150 --> 26:11.970]  I don't think so.
[26:12.290 --> 26:14.990]  I think I'm actually especially bad at rock-paper-scissors.
[26:15.190 --> 26:16.790]  I'd say I'm a bad rock-paper-scissors player.
[26:17.070 --> 26:17.450]  Fair enough.
[26:17.650 --> 26:18.430]  Which pinball do you play?
[26:18.630 --> 26:19.330]  I don't remember.
[26:19.450 --> 26:20.330]  It was just like a whatever.
[26:20.710 --> 26:22.490]  It was like me being bad at a party.
[26:22.610 --> 26:24.530]  Not really knowing anybody and being awkward.
[26:24.710 --> 26:26.390]  So I'm just gonna play pinball in the corner.
[26:26.390 --> 26:28.410]  If it makes you feel any better,
[26:28.550 --> 26:30.610]  that bar that you went to that they would go to every year,
[26:30.650 --> 26:31.490]  I'm pretty sure it closed down.
[26:31.590 --> 26:32.590]  It's closed. It is gone.
[26:32.710 --> 26:35.970]  I don't know why that would make me feel any better at all.
[26:36.150 --> 26:37.490]  I mean, it's not the bar's fault.
[26:38.290 --> 26:40.370]  Isn't it? Isn't it the bar's fault, Andrew?
[26:40.450 --> 26:41.730]  No, it was a great bar.
[26:41.770 --> 26:43.250]  Don't they promise a good time?
[26:43.590 --> 26:45.090]  Did you have a good time? It sounded horrible.
[26:45.390 --> 26:46.790]  I think a good time was there.
[26:46.910 --> 26:48.170]  It's just I couldn't find it.
[26:48.210 --> 26:48.910]  That's my fault.
[26:49.670 --> 26:51.770]  But I think it existed within the premises.
[26:52.030 --> 26:53.350]  I just was too awkward to like...
[26:53.350 --> 26:54.250]  You had all the ingredients.
[26:54.470 --> 26:55.890]  You just couldn't make it into a good time.
[26:55.890 --> 26:56.790]  I just couldn't bake the cake.
[26:57.350 --> 26:58.710]  Honestly, okay, so the first part,
[26:58.850 --> 27:01.490]  there was like a UFC event on and they had a giant TV,
[27:01.650 --> 27:02.810]  so I watched that on a couch.
[27:02.950 --> 27:03.950]  I was like, this is pretty good.
[27:04.010 --> 27:04.790]  And then I played pinball.
[27:05.150 --> 27:06.690]  So like as far as my evening goes,
[27:06.790 --> 27:08.250]  not bad, but terrible party,
[27:08.370 --> 27:10.270]  as far as my involvement in it.
[27:10.570 --> 27:11.630]  So then I leave,
[27:11.890 --> 27:14.210]  and I left because I wanted to catch the finale
[27:14.210 --> 27:15.530]  of True Detective Season 2.
[27:15.630 --> 27:18.130]  And I gave myself like 30 minutes to go,
[27:18.630 --> 27:20.050]  and I just kept walking,
[27:20.230 --> 27:21.730]  and I couldn't quite remember my turn
[27:21.730 --> 27:23.770]  because I spent the entire time talking to the guy,
[27:23.830 --> 27:25.390]  so I wasn't really mindful of...
[27:25.390 --> 27:27.550]  All I had to do was literally I took one turn
[27:27.550 --> 27:28.450]  and then walk straight.
[27:28.590 --> 27:30.290]  So I just had to turn once,
[27:30.410 --> 27:31.350]  and I was set.
[27:31.770 --> 27:34.290]  Or you could have opened a map on your iPhone.
[27:34.610 --> 27:35.010]  Could have done that.
[27:35.370 --> 27:36.630]  I didn't have my phone.
[27:37.070 --> 27:38.290]  My phone died at the party.
[27:38.550 --> 27:39.190]  That's what happened.
[27:39.550 --> 27:40.670]  Both times I've been lost,
[27:40.690 --> 27:41.930]  my phone died at the party,
[27:42.010 --> 27:43.170]  so I didn't have access to my phone,
[27:43.230 --> 27:44.130]  or else I wouldn't use my phone.
[27:44.490 --> 27:45.650]  That would have solved this immediately.
[27:46.110 --> 27:46.870]  So I had no phone,
[27:47.070 --> 27:48.450]  and I just am going straight,
[27:49.210 --> 27:50.830]  and I'm like, eventually I'll find a turn.
[27:50.970 --> 27:52.410]  I just, every street I'd pass,
[27:52.450 --> 27:53.810]  I'd be like, I don't think that was it.
[27:53.810 --> 27:55.110]  And I'd just keep walking,
[27:55.310 --> 27:57.230]  and I realized I had missed my turn
[27:57.230 --> 27:58.310]  when I ran out of buildings.
[27:58.550 --> 28:00.250]  There were no longer any buildings ahead of me.
[28:00.330 --> 28:02.330]  I was like leaving the city, essentially,
[28:02.610 --> 28:03.650]  at that point.
[28:04.090 --> 28:06.250]  It is getting, it's like 11pm,
[28:06.850 --> 28:07.950]  maybe a little bit earlier.
[28:08.090 --> 28:09.230]  It's like 10.30ish, 11.
[28:09.550 --> 28:11.590]  And everything's like, in the area,
[28:11.590 --> 28:12.590]  wasn't really open,
[28:13.110 --> 28:14.230]  and I'm sweating,
[28:14.350 --> 28:15.090]  because it's hot,
[28:15.230 --> 28:16.050]  and it's the summer,
[28:16.670 --> 28:18.490]  and I'm just going up to people asking,
[28:18.670 --> 28:20.110]  like, hey, I'm trying to stay,
[28:20.190 --> 28:21.010]  I stayed here.
[28:21.570 --> 28:22.810]  Could you tell me where it is?
[28:22.810 --> 28:24.090]  I have no idea where I'm going.
[28:24.510 --> 28:26.250]  And they'd kinda point sometimes,
[28:26.470 --> 28:27.490]  or they'd just ignore me.
[28:27.830 --> 28:28.610]  It was a disaster.
[28:29.090 --> 28:31.530]  I spent like 30 minutes lost,
[28:31.650 --> 28:33.650]  walking through the city at night,
[28:33.730 --> 28:35.130]  trying to find my hotel,
[28:35.230 --> 28:36.390]  which I know is close.
[28:36.750 --> 28:38.470]  Like, it's within probably 10 minutes
[28:38.470 --> 28:40.510]  of wherever I am.
[28:41.130 --> 28:42.290]  I'd watch them in the central area.
[28:42.570 --> 28:45.770]  I came across two extremely drunk ladies
[28:45.770 --> 28:47.190]  who were thrilled by the fact
[28:47.190 --> 28:48.210]  that I was from Canada,
[28:48.510 --> 28:49.550]  and they were kind enough
[28:49.550 --> 28:50.830]  to use their phone to help me,
[28:51.070 --> 28:52.090]  but they were too drunk
[28:52.090 --> 28:53.250]  to be useful in any way,
[28:53.530 --> 28:54.690]  so they also just gave me
[28:54.690 --> 28:55.810]  kinda shitty directions.
[28:56.490 --> 28:58.090]  I spent like an hour lost
[28:58.790 --> 28:59.470]  by the end of it,
[28:59.510 --> 29:00.930]  just walking up and down streets,
[29:00.990 --> 29:02.270]  going around trying to ask people.
[29:02.370 --> 29:03.110]  Nobody would help me.
[29:03.550 --> 29:04.890]  Eventually, I came across
[29:04.890 --> 29:06.170]  one of those bike carts
[29:06.170 --> 29:07.630]  that are intended for, like,
[29:07.710 --> 29:08.490]  multiple people,
[29:08.930 --> 29:10.610]  and I'm like, I'll pay you whatever.
[29:10.810 --> 29:11.850]  Just, this is my hotel.
[29:12.090 --> 29:12.830]  I'm so lost.
[29:12.930 --> 29:14.190]  Please take me to this place.
[29:14.390 --> 29:15.310]  Like a little pedicab?
[29:15.670 --> 29:16.990]  Yeah, like a little pedicab.
[29:17.010 --> 29:17.830]  And I hopped in.
[29:18.230 --> 29:19.450]  I just had a great conversation.
[29:19.530 --> 29:20.210]  He was playing, like,
[29:20.210 --> 29:22.290]  Def Leppard extremely loudly.
[29:22.530 --> 29:23.950]  It was like 11pm.
[29:24.470 --> 29:26.470]  His last job was a grave digger
[29:26.470 --> 29:27.050]  in New Orleans,
[29:27.170 --> 29:28.510]  so I just asked him about that.
[29:28.850 --> 29:29.430]  And it was just, like,
[29:29.450 --> 29:31.070]  the most bizarre evening.
[29:31.530 --> 29:32.750]  Like, the conclusion to it.
[29:33.070 --> 29:34.990]  I finish, I get back to the hotel.
[29:35.250 --> 29:36.650]  I'm way late for watching
[29:36.650 --> 29:37.650]  the True Detective finale.
[29:38.250 --> 29:39.250]  I turn it on,
[29:39.810 --> 29:40.290]  and, I mean,
[29:40.390 --> 29:42.130]  spoilers for True Detective Season 2,
[29:42.450 --> 29:43.770]  there's a character in it
[29:43.770 --> 29:45.590]  who dies by having an extended
[29:45.590 --> 29:46.630]  walk through the desert,
[29:46.810 --> 29:47.970]  and that's the exact thing
[29:47.970 --> 29:48.690]  I walked into.
[29:48.690 --> 29:50.150]  It was just this character
[29:50.510 --> 29:51.570]  walking, trying to make it
[29:51.570 --> 29:52.350]  back to the city.
[29:52.770 --> 29:53.650]  It was like Gavin
[29:53.650 --> 29:54.450]  in this fly thing.
[29:54.770 --> 29:55.710]  I perfectly lined up.
[29:56.590 --> 29:57.370]  But yeah, I got,
[29:57.470 --> 29:58.450]  it was just a disaster.
[29:58.890 --> 29:59.830]  Every time, both times
[29:59.830 --> 30:00.810]  I've been lost in Austin,
[30:01.090 --> 30:02.190]  it's because my phone died,
[30:02.290 --> 30:02.630]  and I've gotten
[30:02.630 --> 30:03.450]  shitty directions.
[30:03.670 --> 30:04.750]  And Caleb was the source
[30:04.750 --> 30:05.330]  of both of them.
[30:05.430 --> 30:05.990]  Now I think about it.
[30:06.010 --> 30:06.750]  I just like that you always
[30:06.750 --> 30:08.010]  go to these other cities,
[30:08.470 --> 30:09.650]  miles, not even in your
[30:09.650 --> 30:10.150]  own country,
[30:10.310 --> 30:11.430]  and you refuse to charge
[30:11.430 --> 30:12.150]  your phone every night.
[30:12.630 --> 30:12.990]  Yeah.
[30:13.710 --> 30:14.530]  It was charged.
[30:14.670 --> 30:15.710]  It's just, I was there
[30:15.710 --> 30:16.550]  for a few hours.
[30:16.990 --> 30:17.370]  It died.
[30:17.370 --> 30:17.750]  I don't know.
[30:17.830 --> 30:18.430]  I've always had
[30:18.430 --> 30:19.210]  shitty phones.
[30:19.430 --> 30:20.630]  Outside of my most
[30:20.630 --> 30:21.270]  recent two.
[30:21.570 --> 30:23.610]  It's impressive as well
[30:23.610 --> 30:24.770]  in that, I guess
[30:24.770 --> 30:25.490]  not the case anymore
[30:25.490 --> 30:26.610]  because of the explosive
[30:26.610 --> 30:27.450]  growth of the last
[30:27.450 --> 30:28.050]  two or three years,
[30:28.170 --> 30:29.750]  but this is at a time
[30:29.750 --> 30:30.390]  when Austin didn't
[30:31.230 --> 30:31.690]  have that many
[30:31.690 --> 30:32.290]  big buildings.
[30:32.770 --> 30:33.430]  Yeah, well that's how
[30:33.430 --> 30:33.730]  I knew.
[30:33.830 --> 30:34.970]  Not that much of a city.
[30:35.230 --> 30:35.670]  So it's like,
[30:35.970 --> 30:36.830]  process of elimination,
[30:36.830 --> 30:37.730]  you probably could have
[30:37.730 --> 30:38.610]  walked to every big
[30:38.610 --> 30:39.550]  building in 30 minutes
[30:39.550 --> 30:39.950]  in Austin.
[30:40.330 --> 30:41.370]  That's how I realized
[30:41.370 --> 30:42.150]  I went too far,
[30:42.250 --> 30:43.010]  is the big building
[30:43.010 --> 30:43.850]  stopped existing.
[30:44.150 --> 30:45.210]  It was just all flat.
[30:45.210 --> 30:46.610]  That was my sign
[30:46.610 --> 30:47.510]  that I'm out of the city now.
[30:47.510 --> 30:48.470]  They started getting really small
[30:48.470 --> 30:48.910]  in the back.
[30:48.910 --> 30:49.150]  Yeah.
[30:49.390 --> 30:51.030]  Yeah, everything got really tiny.
[30:51.190 --> 30:52.430]  I'm imagining you walking
[30:52.430 --> 30:53.590]  out of the side of Austin
[30:53.590 --> 30:54.370]  into the desert.
[30:55.090 --> 30:56.190]  You're probably just like
[30:56.190 --> 30:57.310]  two blocks away.
[30:57.810 --> 30:58.910]  That was the first time.
[30:58.970 --> 30:59.730]  The second time,
[31:00.270 --> 31:01.010]  it was the day
[31:01.010 --> 31:01.730]  after it was won,
[31:01.790 --> 31:02.710]  that guy drove me
[31:02.710 --> 31:03.550]  from San Antonio
[31:03.550 --> 31:04.010]  to Austin.
[31:04.270 --> 31:05.250]  The next day,
[31:05.270 --> 31:05.610]  I was like,
[31:05.650 --> 31:06.370]  I want a burger.
[31:06.650 --> 31:07.910]  I went to a burger place
[31:07.910 --> 31:08.690]  that was close,
[31:08.870 --> 31:10.170]  and it happened to be a place
[31:10.170 --> 31:11.290]  that you took me to, Geoff,
[31:11.310 --> 31:12.830]  the first time I went to Austin,
[31:12.930 --> 31:13.330]  you and Caleb.
[31:13.390 --> 31:14.230]  It was this tiny
[31:14.970 --> 31:16.130]  bar burger place.
[31:16.550 --> 31:17.350]  Casino El Camino.
[31:17.550 --> 31:18.430]  No, it wasn't that one.
[31:18.470 --> 31:19.150]  It was a different one.
[31:19.370 --> 31:20.030]  When was my invite,
[31:20.130 --> 31:20.710]  by the way, to that?
[31:20.970 --> 31:21.710]  I don't know.
[31:21.990 --> 31:23.010]  Do you remember what it was called?
[31:23.310 --> 31:23.830]  I have no memory
[31:23.830 --> 31:24.350]  of what it was called.
[31:24.490 --> 31:25.890]  I also think that that business
[31:25.890 --> 31:26.770]  no longer exists.
[31:27.130 --> 31:27.650]  Ah, probably.
[31:27.990 --> 31:28.810]  It was a small,
[31:28.870 --> 31:29.250]  but I was like,
[31:29.310 --> 31:29.970]  oh, I've been here.
[31:30.010 --> 31:31.330]  I didn't realize this was the place
[31:31.330 --> 31:31.950]  I'd been before.
[31:32.050 --> 31:32.510]  That's cool.
[31:32.630 --> 31:33.110]  Had a burger,
[31:33.170 --> 31:33.870]  had a great time.
[31:34.370 --> 31:35.050]  Next day,
[31:35.430 --> 31:36.690]  Caleb and I went for lunch
[31:36.690 --> 31:37.390]  during RTX,
[31:38.070 --> 31:38.890]  and during the lunch,
[31:38.970 --> 31:39.650]  my phone died.
[31:40.170 --> 31:41.290]  And so we ate lunch,
[31:41.290 --> 31:41.590]  and I said,
[31:41.590 --> 31:42.950]  Caleb, my phone is dead.
[31:43.350 --> 31:46.890]  I don't know where my place is,
[31:47.310 --> 31:48.930]  but I know how to get from that
[31:48.930 --> 31:50.570]  bar slash burger place
[31:50.570 --> 31:51.410]  to my place.
[31:51.790 --> 31:52.870]  So if you could tell me
[31:52.870 --> 31:54.950]  where that burger bar place is,
[31:54.990 --> 31:55.850]  it's not far away.
[31:56.130 --> 31:57.250]  Just tell me where it is.
[31:57.350 --> 31:57.990]  And he, once again,
[31:58.050 --> 31:58.950]  his instructions were,
[31:59.010 --> 31:59.470]  he pointed.
[31:59.810 --> 32:00.590]  He's like, that way.
[32:00.990 --> 32:01.870]  So then I just started
[32:01.870 --> 32:03.310]  walking in that direction,
[32:03.770 --> 32:04.410]  found somebody else
[32:04.410 --> 32:05.270]  at the convention center
[32:05.270 --> 32:06.570]  who walked with me for a bit,
[32:06.890 --> 32:07.590]  and we were talking,
[32:07.750 --> 32:09.170]  and he offered me his resume.
[32:09.610 --> 32:11.190]  I said, I can't really help you
[32:11.190 --> 32:12.230]  get a job,
[32:12.330 --> 32:13.610]  and then he was like,
[32:13.830 --> 32:14.710]  cool, I gotta go.
[32:14.870 --> 32:16.110]  So then he abandoned me.
[32:16.490 --> 32:18.470]  I remembered I crossed train tracks
[32:18.470 --> 32:20.070]  going from point A to point B,
[32:20.370 --> 32:22.190]  so I just stood on the train tracks,
[32:22.310 --> 32:23.710]  and I just kept walking down them,
[32:23.930 --> 32:24.390]  because I was like,
[32:24.450 --> 32:25.450]  eventually, once again,
[32:25.490 --> 32:26.450]  I'll find my turn.
[32:26.810 --> 32:27.510]  In the heat,
[32:27.670 --> 32:28.310]  I'm miserable,
[32:28.550 --> 32:28.970]  once again,
[32:29.050 --> 32:30.290]  just drenched in sweat,
[32:30.590 --> 32:32.230]  walking down the train tracks.
[32:32.610 --> 32:35.210]  I was probably like 15 minutes away
[32:35.210 --> 32:36.090]  from having a breakdown
[32:36.090 --> 32:38.330]  of like, I'm so lost.
[32:39.250 --> 32:40.410]  But then I looked up,
[32:40.410 --> 32:41.730]  and I was right in front of my building.
[32:41.990 --> 32:42.990]  I don't know how I got there,
[32:43.150 --> 32:44.230]  but I just made it back,
[32:44.310 --> 32:44.630]  and I was like,
[32:44.670 --> 32:45.790]  oh, that's super convenient.
[32:46.190 --> 32:46.850]  And I was good.
[32:47.230 --> 32:48.950]  Do you think maybe it's not hard
[32:48.950 --> 32:50.430]  to find your front door at all?
[32:50.530 --> 32:51.710]  It's just hard for you
[32:51.710 --> 32:52.610]  to find your front door?
[32:52.710 --> 32:52.970]  No!
[32:53.590 --> 32:54.910]  I mean, I found...
[32:54.910 --> 32:56.150]  Just based off every story
[32:56.150 --> 32:56.770]  you've ever told
[32:56.770 --> 32:57.350]  about you getting from
[32:57.350 --> 32:58.030]  point A to point B?
[32:58.350 --> 32:59.290]  No, it's just,
[32:59.630 --> 33:00.950]  if I was guided to the bar,
[33:01.030 --> 33:01.650]  I knew where to go,
[33:01.710 --> 33:02.710]  because it was a straight shot,
[33:02.770 --> 33:03.730]  and I still found it,
[33:03.790 --> 33:04.170]  but it was,
[33:04.410 --> 33:05.970]  I relied on the train tracks.
[33:06.250 --> 33:07.470]  I was just walking down the tracks.
[33:08.070 --> 33:08.670]  It's terrible.
[33:09.050 --> 33:09.970]  I'm good at getting lost,
[33:09.970 --> 33:10.350]  apparently.
[33:10.550 --> 33:11.530]  I am not convinced
[33:11.530 --> 33:12.690]  your place is hard to find.
[33:12.870 --> 33:13.230]  I'm sorry.
[33:13.790 --> 33:14.570]  No, it is.
[33:15.170 --> 33:15.890]  I will...
[33:15.890 --> 33:16.750]  This is what we'll do.
[33:16.910 --> 33:18.110]  It's definitely hard
[33:18.110 --> 33:18.710]  for you to find,
[33:18.790 --> 33:19.870]  but I think most things are.
[33:19.970 --> 33:21.150]  What if we...
[33:21.150 --> 33:21.850]  You know those, like,
[33:22.070 --> 33:23.310]  tablet that are on wheels?
[33:23.470 --> 33:24.330]  Like, it's a moped
[33:24.970 --> 33:25.690]  slash tablet,
[33:26.190 --> 33:27.130]  and you can see through it?
[33:27.190 --> 33:28.310]  What are the range on those?
[33:28.490 --> 33:29.550]  If I set one up
[33:29.550 --> 33:30.350]  in front of my building,
[33:30.450 --> 33:31.010]  I bet you couldn't
[33:31.010 --> 33:31.670]  find my door
[33:31.670 --> 33:32.710]  within the two minutes.
[33:32.870 --> 33:34.450]  I would love to do this.
[33:34.790 --> 33:35.490]  We have to figure out
[33:35.490 --> 33:36.110]  a way to do, like,
[33:36.150 --> 33:37.510]  long-range camera feed.
[33:37.590 --> 33:38.190]  I don't know if that
[33:38.190 --> 33:39.210]  technology even exists
[33:39.210 --> 33:40.510]  for how we want to use it.
[33:40.510 --> 33:41.250]  It does, yeah.
[33:41.810 --> 33:42.290]  We could do that.
[33:42.290 --> 33:43.130]  Yeah, we can do that.
[33:43.410 --> 33:43.930]  We can easily...
[33:43.930 --> 33:44.250]  We'll find a way.
[33:44.870 --> 33:45.810]  You always have weird
[33:45.810 --> 33:46.750]  interactions with people,
[33:46.870 --> 33:47.710]  by the sounds of it.
[33:47.750 --> 33:48.410]  Oh, the weirdest!
[33:48.990 --> 33:50.110]  The weirdest interactions.
[33:50.130 --> 33:51.070]  You didn't even ever tell us
[33:51.070 --> 33:53.030]  about the orgy invite
[33:53.030 --> 33:53.630]  or anything.
[33:54.570 --> 33:55.210]  I've had weird
[33:55.210 --> 33:56.190]  interactions in Austin, too.
[33:56.310 --> 33:56.990]  I feel like
[33:56.990 --> 33:57.890]  some of them,
[33:58.370 --> 33:58.570]  you know,
[33:58.670 --> 34:00.010]  you can put out a vibe
[34:00.010 --> 34:00.650]  whether or not you want
[34:00.650 --> 34:01.470]  to be spoken to
[34:01.470 --> 34:02.090]  by strangers,
[34:02.290 --> 34:03.010]  but I feel like
[34:03.010 --> 34:03.810]  when I first moved here,
[34:03.830 --> 34:04.530]  I was all for it.
[34:04.590 --> 34:05.510]  I was in a new country.
[34:05.610 --> 34:06.410]  If people came up
[34:06.410 --> 34:07.370]  and spoke to me,
[34:07.390 --> 34:07.630]  I'd be like,
[34:07.670 --> 34:08.370]  Oh, hey, what's up?
[34:08.550 --> 34:09.150]  And once I was,
[34:09.250 --> 34:09.990]  it was when we lived
[34:09.990 --> 34:11.010]  in that rental house, Geoff,
[34:11.370 --> 34:12.470]  I think I'd walked to,
[34:12.610 --> 34:13.870]  uh, like Fresh Plus
[34:13.870 --> 34:14.190]  or something.
[34:14.330 --> 34:15.030]  And I was walking back
[34:15.030 --> 34:16.370]  and some girl stopped me
[34:16.370 --> 34:16.990]  and she was like,
[34:16.990 --> 34:18.530]  uh, Hey, can I talk to you
[34:18.530 --> 34:19.830]  about Planned Parenthood?
[34:19.910 --> 34:20.770]  And I was like,
[34:21.590 --> 34:22.590]  uh, yeah,
[34:22.870 --> 34:23.530]  what's that?
[34:23.690 --> 34:24.130]  And she was like,
[34:24.130 --> 34:24.970]  all right, douchebag.
[34:25.170 --> 34:26.250]  And just turned her back
[34:26.250 --> 34:27.050]  on me and walked off
[34:27.050 --> 34:28.390]  because I didn't know
[34:28.390 --> 34:29.090]  what it was.
[34:29.630 --> 34:30.370]  And she thought
[34:30.370 --> 34:31.470]  I was taking the piss.
[34:32.190 --> 34:33.270]  I assume everyone
[34:33.270 --> 34:34.210]  here knows what it is.
[34:34.250 --> 34:35.030]  They just wanted to
[34:35.030 --> 34:35.870]  tell people about it.
[34:35.870 --> 34:36.370]  And I was like,
[34:36.550 --> 34:37.430]  what's Planned Parenthood?
[34:37.590 --> 34:37.770]  And she,
[34:38.430 --> 34:39.690]  she was having none of it.
[34:39.770 --> 34:40.650]  And I just walked home
[34:40.650 --> 34:41.070]  just like,
[34:41.210 --> 34:42.270]  what did I do?
[34:43.150 --> 34:44.790]  She wanted you
[34:44.790 --> 34:46.010]  to sign your signature
[34:46.010 --> 34:46.870]  on something
[34:46.870 --> 34:48.010]  or to donate money
[34:48.010 --> 34:49.110]  probably to Planned Parenthood.
[34:49.450 --> 34:50.550]  And she probably thought
[34:50.550 --> 34:50.970]  you were putting
[34:50.970 --> 34:51.890]  on a fake accent
[34:51.890 --> 34:53.210]  or just being dismissive.
[34:53.510 --> 34:54.050]  Because those poor,
[34:54.230 --> 34:54.950]  those people get shit
[34:54.950 --> 34:55.610]  on all day long
[34:55.610 --> 34:56.130]  by strangers.
[34:56.450 --> 34:57.310]  That's really funny.
[34:57.910 --> 34:59.130]  Yeah, she was really mean.
[34:59.350 --> 35:00.490]  I was just being friendly.
[35:01.550 --> 35:02.430]  That probably,
[35:02.590 --> 35:03.970]  that probably ruined
[35:03.970 --> 35:04.670]  the next hour.
[35:05.090 --> 35:05.850]  It probably ruined
[35:05.850 --> 35:06.930]  her next hour too.
[35:07.070 --> 35:07.350]  She's like,
[35:07.430 --> 35:07.830]  she went home
[35:07.830 --> 35:08.210]  and she's like,
[35:08.470 --> 35:09.550]  I swear to God,
[35:09.610 --> 35:10.250]  all I'm trying to do
[35:10.250 --> 35:10.650]  is raise money
[35:10.650 --> 35:11.290]  for Planned Parenthood
[35:11.290 --> 35:12.370]  and every fucking dude
[35:12.370 --> 35:12.790]  I talk to
[35:12.790 --> 35:13.710]  is a dickhead to me.
[35:14.990 --> 35:15.650]  This guy,
[35:15.770 --> 35:16.310]  earlier today,
[35:16.590 --> 35:17.450]  he pretended not
[35:17.450 --> 35:18.530]  to know what it is
[35:18.530 --> 35:20.250]  and he used a bad,
[35:20.650 --> 35:21.690]  bad British accent
[35:21.690 --> 35:22.170]  to do it.
[35:24.350 --> 35:25.070]  I don't think
[35:25.070 --> 35:26.170]  I even fully told
[35:26.170 --> 35:26.950]  the homeless
[35:26.950 --> 35:27.570]  orgy
[35:27.570 --> 35:28.790]  story thing.
[35:29.230 --> 35:30.170]  So that happened
[35:30.170 --> 35:30.650]  because I was
[35:30.650 --> 35:31.090]  with somebody
[35:31.090 --> 35:31.630]  who didn't know
[35:31.630 --> 35:32.410]  how to use Uber
[35:32.410 --> 35:33.150]  and they put
[35:33.150 --> 35:33.950]  the pickup point
[35:33.950 --> 35:35.210]  like six blocks away.
[35:35.390 --> 35:36.250]  In the middle of an orgy?
[35:36.450 --> 35:36.690]  There was a,
[35:36.750 --> 35:37.630]  they pinned an orgy?
[35:38.030 --> 35:38.150]  No, no, no.
[35:38.150 --> 35:39.490]  We're outside RTX.
[35:39.990 --> 35:40.590]  This is,
[35:40.670 --> 35:40.890]  there was,
[35:40.990 --> 35:41.870]  I never made it
[35:41.870 --> 35:42.810]  to the homeless orgy,
[35:42.930 --> 35:43.070]  Gavin.
[35:43.190 --> 35:43.530]  I was just,
[35:43.610 --> 35:44.350]  it was an invite
[35:44.350 --> 35:45.510]  that was presented to me.
[35:45.650 --> 35:45.890]  Okay.
[35:46.010 --> 35:46.650]  We're outside
[35:46.650 --> 35:47.590]  the convention center.
[35:47.830 --> 35:48.490]  We're trying to get
[35:48.490 --> 35:49.430]  back to our place.
[35:49.830 --> 35:51.110]  This is not only
[35:51.110 --> 35:52.330]  just pre-ankle roll,
[35:52.450 --> 35:53.390]  this is pre-me
[35:53.390 --> 35:54.370]  having the flu
[35:54.370 --> 35:55.610]  and getting everybody
[35:55.610 --> 35:56.590]  that I was with sick.
[35:58.730 --> 35:59.490]  We are,
[35:59.630 --> 36:00.030]  he's like,
[36:00.090 --> 36:00.770]  I'll call an Uber.
[36:00.770 --> 36:01.470]  Oh, it's weird.
[36:01.570 --> 36:02.210]  It keeps telling me
[36:02.210 --> 36:02.810]  we have to go,
[36:02.810 --> 36:03.430]  go do it.
[36:03.450 --> 36:04.710]  And it's like seven blocks away.
[36:04.790 --> 36:05.950]  And so we're just walking,
[36:06.070 --> 36:06.270]  walking.
[36:06.390 --> 36:07.230]  This homeless guy
[36:07.590 --> 36:08.490]  walks up and is like,
[36:08.530 --> 36:09.270]  hey, can I have money?
[36:09.290 --> 36:09.890]  And I was like,
[36:09.950 --> 36:10.210]  sure.
[36:10.490 --> 36:11.650]  I gave him some money
[36:11.650 --> 36:13.350]  and then we became best friends
[36:13.350 --> 36:14.670]  and he was following me
[36:14.670 --> 36:15.770]  and we're talking the whole way.
[36:16.430 --> 36:17.110]  And we,
[36:17.290 --> 36:18.810]  I had a Seattle Seahawks shirt on
[36:18.810 --> 36:19.730]  and he was talking
[36:19.730 --> 36:20.430]  to me about football.
[36:20.770 --> 36:21.570]  And he's like,
[36:21.610 --> 36:22.790]  you think the Seattle Seahawks
[36:22.790 --> 36:23.650]  are going to win this year?
[36:23.750 --> 36:24.830]  I didn't really think so,
[36:24.870 --> 36:25.190]  but I was like,
[36:25.210 --> 36:25.690]  yeah, maybe.
[36:26.150 --> 36:26.950]  And then he's like,
[36:27.030 --> 36:27.330]  nah,
[36:27.770 --> 36:29.570]  you think the Seattle Seahawks
[36:29.570 --> 36:30.790]  are going to win the Super Bowl
[36:30.790 --> 36:31.290]  this year?
[36:31.690 --> 36:32.110]  And I was like,
[36:32.170 --> 36:32.510]  yeah.
[36:32.910 --> 36:33.170]  He's like,
[36:33.170 --> 36:35.070]  you think the Seattle Seahawks
[36:35.070 --> 36:36.230]  are going to win the Super Bowl
[36:36.230 --> 36:36.730]  this year?
[36:36.810 --> 36:37.030]  And I'm like,
[36:37.050 --> 36:37.270]  yeah,
[36:37.290 --> 36:38.090]  they're going to win!
[36:38.230 --> 36:38.870]  Because it's like,
[36:38.910 --> 36:40.790]  I'm a fucking budget Jerry Maguire.
[36:40.930 --> 36:41.230]  Like,
[36:41.250 --> 36:42.430]  he wanted me to yell about it
[36:42.430 --> 36:43.890]  and I was just playing into his thing.
[36:44.370 --> 36:44.870]  And so I was like,
[36:44.890 --> 36:45.070]  yeah,
[36:45.070 --> 36:45.670]  they're going to win!
[36:45.730 --> 36:46.010]  And he's like,
[36:46.030 --> 36:46.290]  I don't,
[36:46.390 --> 36:47.630]  I don't like the chances this year.
[36:48.050 --> 36:48.310]  I was like,
[36:48.330 --> 36:49.290]  why did we do that?
[36:49.430 --> 36:50.370]  What was the point?
[36:50.930 --> 36:51.250]  Like,
[36:51.370 --> 36:51.470]  why?
[36:51.850 --> 36:53.310]  I think the point was to keep you
[36:53.310 --> 36:54.910]  engaged long enough to get you
[36:54.910 --> 36:56.270]  behind an alley somewhere
[36:56.270 --> 36:57.150]  where he could stab you
[36:57.150 --> 36:58.270]  and have a brand new
[36:58.270 --> 36:59.190]  Seattle Seahawks jersey
[36:59.190 --> 36:59.670]  to walk around in.
[36:59.670 --> 37:00.170]  Or play rock,
[37:00.390 --> 37:00.630]  paper, scissors.
[37:01.090 --> 37:01.350]  Yeah.
[37:02.370 --> 37:03.650]  So then we kept walking
[37:03.650 --> 37:04.590]  and he was talking,
[37:04.630 --> 37:04.790]  like,
[37:04.810 --> 37:06.030]  he just kept talking to me
[37:06.030 --> 37:07.870]  and we're crossing a section
[37:07.870 --> 37:09.490]  and I think somebody realized
[37:09.490 --> 37:10.210]  that it was sort of
[37:10.210 --> 37:11.230]  a weird conversation
[37:11.230 --> 37:11.790]  we were having
[37:11.790 --> 37:13.510]  and they shoulder checked him
[37:13.510 --> 37:14.290]  in the crosswalk
[37:14.290 --> 37:15.430]  and that stopped them
[37:15.430 --> 37:15.870]  for a minute
[37:15.870 --> 37:16.390]  and he turned
[37:16.390 --> 37:16.710]  and he was like,
[37:16.770 --> 37:17.710]  what the fuck to the guy?
[37:18.210 --> 37:19.190]  And I think the point was
[37:19.190 --> 37:19.970]  to try to allow me
[37:19.970 --> 37:20.770]  to get distance,
[37:21.130 --> 37:22.550]  but as soon as we crossed the street
[37:22.550 --> 37:23.370]  my friend was like,
[37:23.370 --> 37:24.590]  oh, this is where we gotta be
[37:24.590 --> 37:25.110]  for the car.
[37:25.570 --> 37:26.850]  So then I'm just standing there
[37:26.850 --> 37:28.510]  and the homeless guy comes back
[37:28.510 --> 37:30.690]  and this is where it elevated
[37:30.690 --> 37:31.590]  to another level.
[37:32.290 --> 37:33.490]  He looked at me
[37:33.490 --> 37:34.470]  and it was like,
[37:35.690 --> 37:37.170]  I would describe the vibe
[37:37.170 --> 37:38.790]  as like Anton Chigurh
[37:38.790 --> 37:39.790]  in the gas station
[37:39.790 --> 37:41.470]  of No Country for Old Men.
[37:41.730 --> 37:43.110]  There's like this weird tension
[37:43.110 --> 37:45.090]  and he was just staring at me
[37:45.090 --> 37:45.490]  and he's like,
[37:45.550 --> 37:46.710]  you have the prettiest eyes
[37:46.710 --> 37:47.410]  I've ever seen.
[37:47.750 --> 37:48.630]  I was like, oh great.
[37:48.790 --> 37:49.510]  We are,
[37:49.650 --> 37:51.370]  we are going somewhere.
[37:51.910 --> 37:52.650]  What color are your eyes?
[37:53.230 --> 37:54.390]  I'd say like a blue,
[37:54.550 --> 37:55.930]  like a darkish blue.
[37:56.270 --> 37:57.750]  Oh, dreamy.
[37:58.570 --> 37:59.370]  Yes, exactly.
[37:59.490 --> 38:00.090]  According to him.
[38:00.730 --> 38:02.030]  And then it turned into,
[38:02.630 --> 38:03.810]  why are you here?
[38:04.770 --> 38:05.530]  And I was like,
[38:05.590 --> 38:06.130]  oh, I'm at,
[38:06.290 --> 38:07.670]  whenever I try to describe
[38:07.670 --> 38:08.670]  RTX to somebody
[38:08.670 --> 38:09.630]  that would have no concept
[38:09.630 --> 38:10.350]  of what it is,
[38:10.690 --> 38:11.370]  I always just say,
[38:11.450 --> 38:12.910]  it's like a video game convention.
[38:14.130 --> 38:15.410]  And he's like, oh,
[38:15.930 --> 38:16.710]  so you're telling me
[38:16.710 --> 38:17.970]  you run all this shit?
[38:18.450 --> 38:19.910]  And he meant the city of Austin.
[38:20.870 --> 38:21.550]  And I was like,
[38:21.590 --> 38:22.390]  no, I just,
[38:22.770 --> 38:23.530]  you know, I just,
[38:23.670 --> 38:23.790]  you know,
[38:23.850 --> 38:24.950]  I like games and stuff,
[38:25.090 --> 38:25.910]  so I'm here for that.
[38:26.030 --> 38:26.430]  And he's like,
[38:26.510 --> 38:28.250]  oh, so you're a hacker and shit?
[38:28.390 --> 38:29.390]  And then he started going,
[38:29.610 --> 38:30.590]  boop, boop, boop, boop.
[38:30.690 --> 38:31.190]  And I was like,
[38:31.250 --> 38:31.950]  no, I just,
[38:32.430 --> 38:33.590]  I like video games.
[38:33.730 --> 38:34.410]  And then he was trying
[38:34.410 --> 38:35.070]  to convince me
[38:35.070 --> 38:36.470]  to go on his workout plan.
[38:36.550 --> 38:36.890]  He's like,
[38:36.950 --> 38:38.170]  you and I can work out.
[38:38.270 --> 38:39.290]  We have a great time.
[38:39.590 --> 38:40.090]  We'll work out.
[38:40.250 --> 38:41.930]  We'll have so much fun.
[38:42.330 --> 38:43.570]  Then it pivoted to
[38:43.570 --> 38:45.030]  that he knew a guy
[38:45.030 --> 38:46.410]  who had a bunch of drugs.
[38:46.990 --> 38:48.610]  And then it pivoted to,
[38:49.010 --> 38:50.370]  where are you staying at?
[38:50.570 --> 38:51.630]  I can bring the party.
[38:51.630 --> 38:53.530]  And it was like a very clear
[38:53.530 --> 38:54.790]  implication of,
[38:55.010 --> 38:55.870]  I don't remember the wording,
[38:55.990 --> 38:56.350]  but it was like,
[38:56.470 --> 38:57.490]  we're going to have an orgy.
[38:57.890 --> 38:58.470]  How was it?
[38:58.730 --> 38:59.210]  How was what?
[38:59.250 --> 38:59.650]  The orgy?
[38:59.870 --> 39:00.210]  Yeah.
[39:00.590 --> 39:01.330]  Not enough condoms.
[39:02.050 --> 39:02.150]  But,
[39:02.690 --> 39:04.150]  can you imagine the podcast
[39:04.150 --> 39:05.370]  you two could have started together
[39:05.370 --> 39:07.170]  if you had just told him
[39:07.170 --> 39:07.810]  where he stayed?
[39:08.410 --> 39:08.650]  Well,
[39:08.770 --> 39:10.330]  he doesn't know where he stayed.
[39:10.410 --> 39:11.510]  He could never find the damn place.
[39:11.910 --> 39:12.550]  That's true.
[39:14.370 --> 39:14.850]  Andrew's like,
[39:14.890 --> 39:15.630]  I'll give you my address
[39:15.630 --> 39:16.330]  in Vancouver Island,
[39:16.430 --> 39:17.710]  but you're never going to find it.
[39:18.570 --> 39:19.790]  The dude's walking around
[39:19.790 --> 39:20.310]  with him and us
[39:20.310 --> 39:20.690]  and he's like,
[39:20.770 --> 39:22.430]  we're going in circles, man.
[39:22.450 --> 39:23.230]  Where are you staying?
[39:23.410 --> 39:24.390]  You're like, I don't know.
[39:27.230 --> 39:28.270]  The entire time,
[39:28.330 --> 39:29.250]  I don't think I blinked.
[39:29.310 --> 39:30.650]  We're having a weird stare down
[39:30.650 --> 39:31.690]  for this whole conversation.
[39:31.970 --> 39:32.350]  And he's like,
[39:32.370 --> 39:33.210]  where are you staying?
[39:33.710 --> 39:35.510]  And I panicked and I lied.
[39:35.610 --> 39:35.990]  I just said,
[39:36.030 --> 39:36.830]  I'm at the Hilton.
[39:37.710 --> 39:38.250]  26th floor.
[39:38.550 --> 39:39.510]  I just came up with the floor.
[39:39.790 --> 39:40.390]  And he's like,
[39:40.450 --> 39:40.710]  cool.
[39:40.970 --> 39:41.710]  And he walked away.
[39:42.030 --> 39:43.130]  I never saw him again.
[39:43.570 --> 39:44.530]  We got in our car.
[39:44.750 --> 39:45.390]  Do you think
[39:45.970 --> 39:46.330]  somebody
[39:47.150 --> 39:47.870]  who maybe
[39:48.430 --> 39:49.770]  looked reasonably like you
[39:49.770 --> 39:51.050]  or even not that like you
[39:51.050 --> 39:51.850]  on the sixth floor
[39:51.850 --> 39:52.310]  of the Hilton
[39:52.310 --> 39:53.910]  just had a surprise orgy
[39:53.910 --> 39:55.010]  happen in their laps?
[39:55.570 --> 39:56.290]  I'm curious
[39:56.290 --> 39:57.270]  what happened that evening
[39:57.270 --> 39:58.330]  on the 26th floor.
[39:58.510 --> 39:59.410]  I'd love to know.
[39:59.530 --> 39:59.910]  I hope not.
[40:00.050 --> 40:00.530]  26th floor.
[40:01.170 --> 40:02.390]  Sounds like a lot of fun
[40:02.390 --> 40:02.870]  might have happened.
[40:03.630 --> 40:04.750]  We get in the car.
[40:05.150 --> 40:06.530]  I feel so sick.
[40:06.610 --> 40:07.190]  And I don't know
[40:07.190 --> 40:08.250]  that I have a flu
[40:08.250 --> 40:09.110]  at this point.
[40:09.150 --> 40:10.170]  Dealing with fever, flu.
[40:10.250 --> 40:10.850]  I had everything.
[40:10.950 --> 40:11.490]  I was super sick.
[40:12.030 --> 40:12.670]  Get home.
[40:12.850 --> 40:14.190]  I immediately vomit.
[40:14.390 --> 40:15.130]  And it was the day
[40:15.130 --> 40:16.030]  that I tried Big Red
[40:16.030 --> 40:16.810]  for the first time.
[40:16.870 --> 40:18.210]  So just bright red puke.
[40:18.790 --> 40:19.590]  Vomit everywhere.
[40:19.590 --> 40:21.550]  And I got everybody sick.
[40:22.030 --> 40:22.610]  But I just, yeah.
[40:22.710 --> 40:23.670]  I've had so many...
[40:23.670 --> 40:24.950]  I don't know what it is about me
[40:24.950 --> 40:26.390]  but I draw weird interaction
[40:26.390 --> 40:26.810]  with people.
[40:27.210 --> 40:28.210]  Like I have a magnet to it.
[40:28.710 --> 40:29.350]  It could be fun
[40:29.350 --> 40:30.310]  or it could be
[40:30.310 --> 40:30.890]  you're invited
[40:30.890 --> 40:31.650]  to a homeless orgy.
[40:31.950 --> 40:32.930]  Which also could be fun.
[40:33.270 --> 40:33.490]  Yeah.
[40:33.830 --> 40:34.710]  Could be.
[40:35.310 --> 40:36.190]  Can't complain about that
[40:36.190 --> 40:36.590]  necessarily.
[40:37.030 --> 40:37.950]  I don't know
[40:37.950 --> 40:38.490]  that I'd want to be
[40:38.490 --> 40:39.050]  the kind of guy
[40:39.050 --> 40:40.370]  who goes an entire life
[40:40.370 --> 40:41.130]  without ever getting
[40:41.130 --> 40:42.330]  invited to a homeless orgy.
[40:42.530 --> 40:42.730]  You know?
[40:43.130 --> 40:44.250]  Is that a life worth living?
[40:45.270 --> 40:45.670]  Yes.
[40:46.450 --> 40:47.010]  Great point.
[40:47.030 --> 40:47.950]  How many homeless orgies
[40:47.950 --> 40:48.890]  have you been invited to,
[40:49.090 --> 40:49.130]  Gavin?
[40:49.970 --> 40:50.770]  Not any.
[40:51.310 --> 40:51.810]  Yeah, see?
[40:52.890 --> 40:54.430]  What a sad, sad life.
[40:54.970 --> 40:55.670]  For a sad little man.
[40:55.970 --> 40:56.890]  I didn't know that you
[40:56.890 --> 40:58.110]  filmed F1 stuff,
[40:58.550 --> 40:58.730]  Gavin.
[40:58.970 --> 40:59.510]  Dude, he filmed
[40:59.510 --> 41:00.410]  Fernando Alonso.
[41:00.750 --> 41:01.070]  He did?
[41:01.130 --> 41:01.890]  That's what I was doing.
[41:02.190 --> 41:03.070]  Alonso was waiting.
[41:03.690 --> 41:04.670]  I had no idea.
[41:06.270 --> 41:07.130]  I don't think it was
[41:07.130 --> 41:07.970]  actually for...
[41:07.970 --> 41:08.530]  It wasn't a real
[41:08.530 --> 41:09.290]  Formula 1 race.
[41:09.410 --> 41:10.110]  It was...
[41:10.110 --> 41:10.910]  I want to say it was
[41:10.910 --> 41:11.590]  like a commercial
[41:11.590 --> 41:13.110]  for Santander or something
[41:13.110 --> 41:14.890]  who maybe sponsored
[41:15.710 --> 41:16.110]  some...
[41:16.110 --> 41:16.510]  I don't know.
[41:16.910 --> 41:17.530]  Who knows?
[41:17.930 --> 41:18.990]  I don't really know
[41:18.990 --> 41:19.770]  about all the stuff
[41:19.770 --> 41:20.170]  I worked on.
[41:20.270 --> 41:20.730]  Sometimes you just
[41:20.730 --> 41:21.430]  show up and shoot it
[41:21.430 --> 41:22.450]  and you never see it.
[41:23.490 --> 41:24.510]  It probably didn't even
[41:24.510 --> 41:25.570]  air in the UK or
[41:25.570 --> 41:26.130]  anything.
[41:26.590 --> 41:27.070]  Do you remember
[41:27.070 --> 41:28.130]  what the commercial was?
[41:28.770 --> 41:29.110]  I don't know.
[41:29.790 --> 41:30.370]  I can show you
[41:30.370 --> 41:30.910]  the footage if you want.
[41:31.270 --> 41:32.590]  I'd love to see the footage.
[41:32.650 --> 41:33.590]  You still have the footage?
[41:33.930 --> 41:34.150]  Yeah.
[41:34.570 --> 41:35.450]  I got most of the stuff
[41:35.450 --> 41:35.750]  I shot.
[41:36.090 --> 41:36.310]  Oh.
[41:36.790 --> 41:37.390]  That's really cool.
[41:37.710 --> 41:38.810]  It is pretty cool.
[41:38.930 --> 41:39.930]  It makes me respect him
[41:39.930 --> 41:40.530]  a little bit more
[41:40.530 --> 41:41.250]  when I find out he's
[41:41.250 --> 41:41.910]  worked on stuff that
[41:41.910 --> 41:43.210]  I now like, like F1.
[41:44.010 --> 41:45.270]  Why do you like F1
[41:45.270 --> 41:45.870]  so much now?
[41:46.050 --> 41:46.350]  Have you ever
[41:46.350 --> 41:46.750]  watched it?
[41:46.970 --> 41:47.150]  Yeah.
[41:47.510 --> 41:48.210]  It's fucking awesome.
[41:49.910 --> 41:50.750]  It's a hard point
[41:50.750 --> 41:51.510]  to argue against.
[41:52.230 --> 41:53.350]  I mean, I feel like
[41:53.350 --> 41:54.090]  that's the answer.
[41:54.170 --> 41:54.610]  Yeah, it's cool.
[41:54.710 --> 41:55.370]  I mean, technically
[41:55.370 --> 41:56.630]  it's very cool.
[41:56.990 --> 41:57.750]  It's not...
[41:57.750 --> 41:58.770]  I find it not
[41:58.770 --> 41:59.830]  very fun to watch
[41:59.830 --> 42:00.510]  in person, though.
[42:00.870 --> 42:01.850]  I've never seen a race
[42:01.850 --> 42:02.270]  in person.
[42:02.410 --> 42:03.250]  You really don't get
[42:03.250 --> 42:04.510]  a sense of, like,
[42:04.570 --> 42:05.530]  where the race is.
[42:05.850 --> 42:06.970]  If you're on a corner,
[42:07.070 --> 42:07.710]  you just kind of see
[42:07.710 --> 42:08.610]  cars pass by
[42:08.610 --> 42:09.370]  and you don't...
[42:09.370 --> 42:10.390]  It really is much
[42:10.390 --> 42:11.570]  better televised, I think.
[42:11.810 --> 42:12.850]  I feel like most sporting
[42:12.850 --> 42:14.070]  events are better televised.
[42:14.070 --> 42:15.070]  Yeah, I agree.
[42:16.350 --> 42:17.170]  A football match?
[42:17.330 --> 42:18.330]  That's nice in person.
[42:18.430 --> 42:19.070]  You get the vibe.
[42:19.630 --> 42:20.390]  You get the cheering.
[42:20.710 --> 42:21.170]  You get people
[42:21.170 --> 42:22.010]  standing up in front of you
[42:22.010 --> 42:22.690]  and not sitting down
[42:22.690 --> 42:23.170]  for half an hour.
[42:23.950 --> 42:25.150]  That was fucking annoying.
[42:25.570 --> 42:26.770]  Oh my god, dude.
[42:28.450 --> 42:29.190]  I would say it's funny
[42:29.190 --> 42:30.190]  because I made a joke.
[42:30.630 --> 42:31.430]  So Gavin and I went
[42:31.430 --> 42:32.030]  to a...
[42:32.470 --> 42:32.870]  for...
[42:32.870 --> 42:33.270]  what was that?
[42:33.310 --> 42:34.350]  Last Saturday,
[42:34.710 --> 42:35.070]  I guess?
[42:35.410 --> 42:35.650]  Yeah.
[42:35.910 --> 42:36.370]  Well, first off,
[42:36.430 --> 42:37.430]  we hung out in person
[42:37.430 --> 42:39.030]  and nothing blew up.
[42:39.590 --> 42:40.390]  Everything held.
[42:40.670 --> 42:41.230]  There was no
[42:41.230 --> 42:42.190]  extra weirdness
[42:42.190 --> 42:43.070]  aside from I got
[42:43.070 --> 42:43.710]  some cucumbers
[42:43.710 --> 42:45.330]  that was given to me.
[42:45.630 --> 42:45.770]  Well, alright.
[42:45.870 --> 42:46.610]  Well, that was
[42:46.610 --> 42:47.530]  fucking weird.
[42:48.050 --> 42:49.170]  That in itself
[42:49.170 --> 42:49.890]  was a whole...
[42:49.890 --> 42:50.870]  there was a whole thing.
[42:51.290 --> 42:51.690]  Andrew,
[42:51.830 --> 42:52.470]  there's a whole thing.
[42:52.590 --> 42:53.190]  Did you hear about
[42:53.190 --> 42:53.570]  the cucumbers?
[42:54.090 --> 42:54.930]  No, I have no idea
[42:54.930 --> 42:55.570]  about the cucumbers.
[42:55.790 --> 42:57.310]  Well, we should get into it
[42:57.310 --> 42:58.170]  because it was
[42:58.650 --> 42:59.290]  fascinating to me.
[42:59.850 --> 43:00.570]  However, yeah,
[43:00.670 --> 43:02.010]  we spent an entire time
[43:02.010 --> 43:02.510]  hanging out
[43:02.510 --> 43:04.930]  and I would say
[43:04.930 --> 43:05.370]  it was a pretty
[43:06.630 --> 43:08.170]  medium, decent time.
[43:09.190 --> 43:10.030]  I was telling Andrew,
[43:10.430 --> 43:11.610]  I don't know what we would...
[43:11.610 --> 43:12.150]  like, I don't even...
[43:12.150 --> 43:13.090]  nothing funny happened.
[43:13.090 --> 43:14.330]  Nothing gross happened.
[43:14.510 --> 43:15.810]  Nothing weird happened.
[43:15.910 --> 43:17.630]  It was just a medium time.
[43:17.970 --> 43:18.930]  I mean, it was nice.
[43:19.170 --> 43:20.190]  It was a good time.
[43:20.310 --> 43:21.010]  I had a lovely time.
[43:21.070 --> 43:21.630]  It was me and you
[43:21.630 --> 43:23.170]  and Emily and Millicent
[43:23.170 --> 43:23.850]  and we went to
[43:24.370 --> 43:25.210]  to see the
[43:25.210 --> 43:26.450]  first home game
[43:26.450 --> 43:27.550]  of the Austin FC
[43:27.550 --> 43:28.130]  soccer...
[43:28.130 --> 43:28.870]  MLS soccer team.
[43:29.070 --> 43:29.890]  Nothing of, like,
[43:29.970 --> 43:31.030]  f*** face note
[43:31.030 --> 43:32.070]  happened, which
[43:32.070 --> 43:33.250]  means it was a good time.
[43:33.530 --> 43:33.710]  Yeah.
[43:33.810 --> 43:34.810]  I mean, I will say
[43:34.810 --> 43:36.150]  we had to
[43:36.150 --> 43:37.070]  we had to endure
[43:37.070 --> 43:37.910]  Matthew McConaughey
[43:37.910 --> 43:39.050]  looking like a
[43:39.050 --> 43:40.010]  goddamn leprechaun.
[43:40.470 --> 43:40.850]  That was weird.
[43:40.850 --> 43:41.390]  Oh, I love that bit.
[43:42.270 --> 43:43.330]  Andrew, he came out
[43:43.330 --> 43:43.890]  because he's a part
[43:43.890 --> 43:44.650]  owner of the team.
[43:44.850 --> 43:44.930]  Yes.
[43:44.930 --> 43:46.570]  And he has to, you know,
[43:47.030 --> 43:47.770]  McConaughey bless
[43:47.770 --> 43:48.230]  all of
[43:48.230 --> 43:49.690]  every cool thing in Austin,
[43:49.810 --> 43:50.050]  you know?
[43:50.470 --> 43:51.450]  Well, first off, he did
[43:51.450 --> 43:52.010]  like a
[43:52.010 --> 43:54.190]  like a scat type
[43:54.190 --> 43:55.390]  rap thing
[43:55.390 --> 43:56.190]  that he does,
[43:56.350 --> 43:56.590]  you know,
[43:56.670 --> 43:57.490]  where he just f***ing
[43:57.490 --> 43:59.110]  just freestyles
[43:59.110 --> 43:59.910]  some bulls***
[43:59.910 --> 44:00.930]  that sounds like
[44:00.930 --> 44:01.310]  some s***
[44:01.310 --> 44:02.190]  but means nothing.
[44:02.450 --> 44:03.470]  You know, he did that
[44:03.470 --> 44:04.130]  for a little bit
[44:04.130 --> 44:04.950]  about Austin
[44:04.950 --> 44:06.150]  and competition
[44:06.150 --> 44:07.550]  and f***ing soccer
[44:07.550 --> 44:07.770]  or something.
[44:07.770 --> 44:08.550]  I was looking at him
[44:08.550 --> 44:09.470]  down there on the pitch
[44:09.470 --> 44:10.690]  while he was dressed in
[44:10.690 --> 44:11.770]  green and slamming
[44:11.770 --> 44:12.350]  on his drum
[44:12.350 --> 44:13.170]  and I just thought
[44:13.170 --> 44:13.890]  that guy was an
[44:14.370 --> 44:14.610]  interstellar.
[44:14.910 --> 44:15.710]  Yeah, dude.
[44:15.970 --> 44:17.070]  Then he...
[44:17.070 --> 44:17.770]  Gavin's not kidding,
[44:17.850 --> 44:18.790]  he walked out on the
[44:18.790 --> 44:19.830]  pitch in a
[44:20.490 --> 44:21.450]  bright green
[44:21.450 --> 44:21.970]  suit,
[44:22.230 --> 44:23.270]  like a full suit,
[44:23.870 --> 44:24.590]  which, by the way,
[44:24.690 --> 44:25.750]  brave to do
[44:25.750 --> 44:26.510]  because you can
[44:26.510 --> 44:27.030]  green screen
[44:27.430 --> 44:28.410]  anything on that dude.
[44:28.870 --> 44:29.550]  Like he won
[44:29.550 --> 44:30.310]  a golf tournament.
[44:30.690 --> 44:30.950]  Yeah.
[44:31.270 --> 44:32.630]  And then...
[44:32.630 --> 44:33.650]  Yeah, like he won
[44:33.650 --> 44:34.150]  a golf tournament.
[44:34.310 --> 44:35.110]  Yeah, like he...
[44:35.110 --> 44:35.450]  Yeah.
[44:35.570 --> 44:37.450]  And then he played
[44:37.450 --> 44:38.270]  the bongos.
[44:38.830 --> 44:38.970]  Okay.
[44:39.150 --> 44:39.970]  Like seriously.
[44:40.570 --> 44:41.510]  It was just one bongo.
[44:42.230 --> 44:42.670]  BONG!
[44:42.670 --> 44:43.090]  BONG BONG!
[44:44.190 --> 44:44.630]  BONG!
[44:45.450 --> 44:46.150]  BONG BONG!
[44:46.430 --> 44:47.430]  For an eternity.
[44:47.690 --> 44:48.050]  And then we got
[44:48.050 --> 44:48.710]  to watch a soccer game.
[44:48.810 --> 44:49.290]  It was great.
[44:51.110 --> 44:51.930]  Did they win?
[44:52.390 --> 44:53.190]  Uh, they tied.
[44:54.190 --> 44:55.270]  The first game
[44:55.270 --> 44:56.330]  of the entire stadium
[44:56.330 --> 44:57.270]  like, for real.
[44:57.670 --> 44:58.350]  And it was a nil,
[44:58.410 --> 44:58.930]  nil, nil.
[44:59.310 --> 45:00.070]  Yeah, it was a
[45:00.070 --> 45:01.010]  pretty typical
[45:01.010 --> 45:01.590]  soccer game.
[45:01.690 --> 45:02.330]  It was a 0-0.
[45:03.070 --> 45:03.370]  Wow.
[45:04.090 --> 45:04.830]  I was sat next
[45:04.830 --> 45:05.270]  to Millie
[45:05.270 --> 45:06.390]  and the game
[45:06.390 --> 45:07.230]  ended and she was like,
[45:07.230 --> 45:08.210]  all right, so what,
[45:08.290 --> 45:08.990]  we go into overtime
[45:08.990 --> 45:09.290]  or what?
[45:09.350 --> 45:09.630]  I was like,
[45:09.790 --> 45:10.390]  no, that was it.
[45:10.470 --> 45:11.010]  We go home.
[45:12.430 --> 45:13.070]  She was like, wait,
[45:13.110 --> 45:13.770]  that happens?
[45:13.930 --> 45:14.790]  I was like, oh yeah,
[45:14.830 --> 45:16.210]  that happens all the time.
[45:16.550 --> 45:17.970]  Makes it really
[45:17.970 --> 45:18.730]  exciting when there's
[45:18.730 --> 45:19.150]  a goal there.
[45:19.510 --> 45:20.610]  You have McConaughey
[45:20.610 --> 45:21.390]  on more drums
[45:21.390 --> 45:22.390]  and nobody scores.
[45:22.970 --> 45:23.570]  It's a disappointing
[45:23.570 --> 45:23.830]  evening.
[45:24.250 --> 45:25.110]  We had that mojo
[45:25.110 --> 45:25.730]  working for us
[45:25.730 --> 45:26.030]  and we still
[45:26.030 --> 45:26.470]  couldn't score.
[45:26.570 --> 45:27.290]  I gotta say though,
[45:27.350 --> 45:28.330]  gorgeous stadium.
[45:28.870 --> 45:29.730]  Awesome that Austin
[45:29.730 --> 45:30.730]  finally has a pro team.
[45:31.310 --> 45:32.350]  Really cool experience
[45:32.350 --> 45:32.950]  getting to go to the
[45:32.950 --> 45:33.570]  first game.
[45:33.570 --> 45:34.410]  And it was awesome
[45:34.410 --> 45:35.330]  that Emily was able
[45:35.330 --> 45:35.730]  to put all that
[45:35.730 --> 45:36.210]  together for us.
[45:36.250 --> 45:36.870]  And I had a wonderful
[45:36.870 --> 45:37.150]  time.
[45:37.430 --> 45:38.370]  And I'm really glad
[45:38.370 --> 45:39.990]  that none of us
[45:39.990 --> 45:40.630]  broke anything
[45:40.630 --> 45:42.450]  and there was no
[45:42.450 --> 45:44.150]  tornado or any kind
[45:44.150 --> 45:44.770]  of weather event.
[45:44.970 --> 45:46.270]  It gave me hope
[45:46.270 --> 45:46.850]  that maybe we could
[45:46.850 --> 45:47.490]  do it again someday.
[45:48.410 --> 45:49.310]  I mean, this all
[45:49.310 --> 45:50.110]  sounds fantastic.
[45:50.370 --> 45:51.210]  I feel like I missed
[45:51.210 --> 45:51.950]  what happened with
[45:51.950 --> 45:52.370]  the cucumber.
[45:52.610 --> 45:53.250]  Where's the cucumber
[45:53.250 --> 45:53.990]  coming into play?
[45:54.130 --> 45:54.750]  Did I miss that?
[45:54.910 --> 45:55.850]  Okay, so I pick,
[45:56.050 --> 45:56.730]  Gavin shows up
[45:56.730 --> 45:57.170]  at my house
[45:57.170 --> 45:58.230]  and as we're driving
[45:58.230 --> 45:58.650]  he goes,
[45:58.950 --> 45:59.930]  I had a weird thing
[45:59.930 --> 46:00.530]  happen today.
[46:00.730 --> 46:01.830]  And I go, what's that?
[46:01.910 --> 46:02.170]  And he goes,
[46:02.290 --> 46:03.310]  somebody chucked
[46:03.310 --> 46:04.170]  a load of pickles
[46:04.170 --> 46:05.350]  on my front door
[46:05.710 --> 46:07.630]  in a bag full
[46:07.630 --> 46:08.130]  of brine,
[46:08.270 --> 46:09.110]  like pickle brine.
[46:09.190 --> 46:09.550]  And I was like,
[46:09.730 --> 46:10.650]  you mean like a jar
[46:10.650 --> 46:11.550]  of LASIK pickles,
[46:11.670 --> 46:12.090]  full pickles,
[46:12.570 --> 46:13.450]  dumped into a freezer
[46:13.450 --> 46:14.670]  bag, ziplocked shut,
[46:14.770 --> 46:15.550]  like full of brine
[46:15.550 --> 46:15.890]  and pickles.
[46:16.070 --> 46:16.550]  And he was like,
[46:16.570 --> 46:17.190]  yeah, it's just on
[46:17.190 --> 46:17.990]  my front porch.
[46:18.330 --> 46:20.070]  And then I was like,
[46:20.070 --> 46:21.310]  well you have cameras,
[46:21.390 --> 46:21.910]  so let's look
[46:21.910 --> 46:22.330]  at the cameras.
[46:22.670 --> 46:23.150]  He pulls up,
[46:23.230 --> 46:23.670]  there's no,
[46:24.050 --> 46:24.530]  the pickles just
[46:24.530 --> 46:25.790]  show up on his
[46:25.790 --> 46:26.370]  front door camera.
[46:27.690 --> 46:28.250]  It's like,
[46:28.310 --> 46:29.010]  it's like they just
[46:29.010 --> 46:30.210]  get delivered by a
[46:30.210 --> 46:31.050]  hand that didn't
[46:31.050 --> 46:31.590]  have a body.
[46:32.050 --> 46:32.710]  You can just see
[46:32.710 --> 46:34.130]  them like slide
[46:34.130 --> 46:35.130]  into frame and
[46:35.130 --> 46:35.910]  there's no one there.
[46:36.070 --> 46:36.950]  So we talk about
[46:36.950 --> 46:37.910]  this all night
[46:37.910 --> 46:38.630]  while we're at the,
[46:38.810 --> 46:40.050]  we're having soccer
[46:40.050 --> 46:40.570]  fun, right?
[46:40.810 --> 46:41.450]  And, oh,
[46:41.530 --> 46:42.070]  and by the way,
[46:42.190 --> 46:43.370]  Gav, there was one
[46:43.370 --> 46:43.950]  thing going on that
[46:43.950 --> 46:44.470]  I never told you
[46:44.470 --> 46:45.190]  about that was
[46:45.190 --> 46:45.910]  distracting me all
[46:45.910 --> 46:46.650]  night, but I'll
[46:46.650 --> 46:47.010]  bring it up.
[46:47.450 --> 46:48.290]  So the whole ride
[46:48.290 --> 46:48.970]  back to Gavin's
[46:48.970 --> 46:49.290]  house, we're going
[46:49.290 --> 46:49.630]  to give him a ride
[46:49.630 --> 46:50.450]  home, we're like,
[46:50.450 --> 46:51.150]  do you think the pickles
[46:51.150 --> 46:51.770]  will be on the porch?
[46:51.810 --> 46:52.230]  Should we check?
[46:52.450 --> 46:53.370]  We get there, we run
[46:53.370 --> 46:55.430]  up and there were
[46:55.430 --> 46:57.550]  three giant dry-ass
[46:57.550 --> 46:58.810]  cucumbers in a
[46:58.810 --> 47:00.050]  Ziploc bag that
[47:00.050 --> 47:00.850]  obviously came from
[47:00.850 --> 47:01.530]  somebody's garden.
[47:01.870 --> 47:02.150]  There was no,
[47:02.250 --> 47:02.810]  they weren't pickles.
[47:03.310 --> 47:04.090]  I don't know how
[47:04.090 --> 47:04.690]  Gavin got that they
[47:04.690 --> 47:04.930]  were pickles.
[47:05.230 --> 47:05.870]  There was no pickled
[47:05.870 --> 47:06.370]  brine.
[47:06.690 --> 47:07.710]  There was no brine of
[47:07.710 --> 47:08.230]  anything.
[47:08.550 --> 47:09.410]  It was just three
[47:09.410 --> 47:11.010]  cucumbers in a bag.
[47:11.430 --> 47:12.370]  In my defense, the
[47:12.370 --> 47:13.150]  bag was full of
[47:13.150 --> 47:14.310]  condensation and I
[47:14.310 --> 47:15.150]  think I mistook it
[47:15.150 --> 47:16.210]  for, all I did,
[47:16.410 --> 47:17.330]  all I did really,
[47:17.550 --> 47:18.390]  there was a, you
[47:18.390 --> 47:18.810]  know, there was an
[47:18.810 --> 47:19.290]  Uber waiting.
[47:19.510 --> 47:20.650]  I just walked out
[47:20.650 --> 47:21.330]  my front door.
[47:21.610 --> 47:22.730]  I thought, that looks
[47:22.730 --> 47:23.790]  like a bag of pickles
[47:23.790 --> 47:24.670]  as I stepped over
[47:24.670 --> 47:25.470]  them and then I just
[47:25.470 --> 47:26.210]  continued walking.
[47:26.270 --> 47:26.930]  I didn't touch him,
[47:26.990 --> 47:27.630]  I didn't really look
[47:27.630 --> 47:27.870]  at him.
[47:28.270 --> 47:28.910]  And I was like,
[47:29.190 --> 47:30.970]  surely, surely there's
[47:30.970 --> 47:31.730]  Emily's like, surely
[47:31.730 --> 47:32.650]  there was a note or
[47:32.650 --> 47:32.950]  something.
[47:32.970 --> 47:33.510]  And he's like, no,
[47:33.590 --> 47:33.950]  no, nothing.
[47:34.230 --> 47:35.250]  I walk up, I look at
[47:35.250 --> 47:36.630]  the cucumbers, I
[47:36.630 --> 47:37.650]  immediately identify
[47:37.650 --> 47:38.530]  they are not pickles.
[47:38.750 --> 47:39.570]  Look to the right,
[47:39.870 --> 47:40.790]  see the note, pick it
[47:40.790 --> 47:40.950]  up.
[47:41.150 --> 47:41.990]  It's like, hey,
[47:42.010 --> 47:42.710]  here's some cucumbers
[47:42.710 --> 47:43.430]  from the garden.
[47:43.710 --> 47:44.590]  If you don't need
[47:44.590 --> 47:45.130]  them, pass them on
[47:45.130 --> 47:45.490]  to the next
[47:45.490 --> 47:45.750]  neighbor.
[47:45.870 --> 47:46.270]  Thanks.
[47:48.150 --> 47:49.170]  It was more
[47:49.170 --> 47:50.430]  confusing at a
[47:50.430 --> 47:50.770]  glance.
[47:51.110 --> 47:51.630]  Everything made
[47:51.630 --> 47:52.350]  sense now that I
[47:52.350 --> 47:52.850]  had time to
[47:52.850 --> 47:53.330]  investigate.
[47:53.890 --> 47:55.810]  Also, when Gavin
[47:55.810 --> 47:56.810]  found the other
[47:56.810 --> 47:57.730]  footage, it got
[47:57.730 --> 47:58.110]  interesting.
[47:58.270 --> 47:59.030]  I will say that.
[47:59.430 --> 48:00.210]  He found footage
[48:00.210 --> 48:01.050]  from another camera
[48:01.050 --> 48:01.990]  that was fascinating.
[48:02.370 --> 48:02.990]  It was delivered, I
[48:02.990 --> 48:03.850]  guess, by an elderly
[48:03.850 --> 48:06.350]  woman who...
[48:06.350 --> 48:06.950]  Mission Impossible
[48:06.950 --> 48:07.210]  did.
[48:07.230 --> 48:08.030]  Kind of looked
[48:08.030 --> 48:09.170]  like, kind of
[48:09.170 --> 48:10.830]  looked like a witch
[48:10.830 --> 48:11.510]  out of Left 4
[48:11.510 --> 48:11.710]  Dead.
[48:11.710 --> 48:12.750]  And she...
[48:13.830 --> 48:14.550]  She was, like,
[48:15.050 --> 48:15.930]  hobbling around.
[48:16.410 --> 48:17.390]  And she, like,
[48:17.550 --> 48:18.650]  grabs the pole
[48:18.650 --> 48:19.710]  near the front
[48:19.710 --> 48:20.590]  of the house and
[48:20.590 --> 48:21.910]  kind of swings her
[48:21.910 --> 48:22.550]  arm around and
[48:22.550 --> 48:23.750]  just, like, slides it
[48:23.750 --> 48:25.390]  onto the bit that
[48:25.390 --> 48:25.970]  the camera could
[48:25.970 --> 48:26.170]  see.
[48:26.470 --> 48:27.150]  She, like, deliberately
[48:27.150 --> 48:27.990]  avoided going up the
[48:27.990 --> 48:28.230]  steps.
[48:28.310 --> 48:28.950]  She just reached
[48:28.950 --> 48:30.110]  around the railings
[48:30.110 --> 48:31.310]  and put it there.
[48:31.350 --> 48:32.030]  So it looked like
[48:32.030 --> 48:33.070]  from the doorbell
[48:33.070 --> 48:33.790]  that no one
[48:33.790 --> 48:34.330]  delivered it.
[48:34.610 --> 48:35.270]  Gavin was right
[48:35.270 --> 48:35.910]  when he texted it
[48:35.910 --> 48:36.090]  to me.
[48:36.150 --> 48:36.990]  He goes, she has
[48:36.990 --> 48:37.730]  advanced angles.
[48:37.730 --> 48:39.030]  And he couldn't
[48:39.030 --> 48:39.490]  have been more
[48:39.490 --> 48:39.790]  true.
[48:40.350 --> 48:41.690]  Like, she totally,
[48:41.990 --> 48:43.270]  like, Ethan hunted
[48:43.270 --> 48:44.370]  her way across
[48:44.370 --> 48:44.830]  his driveway.
[48:45.710 --> 48:46.130]  So he, like,
[48:46.150 --> 48:47.110]  hugged the wall.
[48:47.410 --> 48:48.130]  She was looking
[48:48.130 --> 48:48.890]  over her shoulder
[48:48.890 --> 48:49.810]  and looking around
[48:49.810 --> 48:51.030]  trying to spot,
[48:51.130 --> 48:51.890]  like, I don't
[48:51.890 --> 48:52.490]  know, threats.
[48:52.870 --> 48:53.490]  It was fucking
[48:53.490 --> 48:54.110]  fascinating.
[48:54.290 --> 48:54.970]  And then she just
[48:54.970 --> 48:55.830]  disappeared into the
[48:55.830 --> 48:56.410]  darkness from when
[48:56.410 --> 48:56.770]  she came.
[48:56.990 --> 48:57.830]  And she did look
[48:57.830 --> 48:58.570]  a little like a
[48:58.570 --> 48:59.150]  Left 4 Dead witch.
[48:59.370 --> 49:00.110]  He's not wrong there.
[49:00.330 --> 49:01.250]  And she came,
[49:01.430 --> 49:01.790]  like, she didn't
[49:01.790 --> 49:02.430]  come from the street.
[49:02.530 --> 49:02.890]  It looked like she
[49:02.890 --> 49:03.710]  came out of my own
[49:03.710 --> 49:04.450]  garage somehow.
[49:04.570 --> 49:05.610]  I don't know where she
[49:05.610 --> 49:05.930]  came from.
[49:05.930 --> 49:06.450]  She came from your
[49:06.450 --> 49:07.910]  backyard or wherever.
[49:08.390 --> 49:09.310]  I assume she lives
[49:09.310 --> 49:09.890]  under the house.
[49:10.170 --> 49:10.530]  I don't know.
[49:10.730 --> 49:11.910]  Maybe they're my
[49:11.910 --> 49:12.910]  cucumbers and she just
[49:12.910 --> 49:13.690]  picked them for me.
[49:16.010 --> 49:17.050]  Either way, it's weird.
[49:17.170 --> 49:17.590]  I don't know what
[49:17.590 --> 49:18.390]  you want me to...
[49:18.390 --> 49:18.910]  I guess it's a
[49:18.910 --> 49:19.230]  kindness.
[49:19.670 --> 49:20.510]  It's like old lady
[49:20.510 --> 49:21.310]  kindness that doesn't
[49:21.310 --> 49:21.890]  exist anymore.
[49:22.010 --> 49:23.090]  But it is...
[49:23.090 --> 49:23.750]  I mean, I've never
[49:24.210 --> 49:25.290]  met this person.
[49:25.530 --> 49:26.050]  I've never
[49:26.050 --> 49:27.350]  expressed excitement
[49:27.350 --> 49:28.970]  for foreign cucumbers.
[49:29.510 --> 49:30.430]  Have you ever seen
[49:30.430 --> 49:31.410]  a Little Left 4 Dead
[49:31.410 --> 49:31.970]  witch hanging around
[49:31.970 --> 49:32.470]  your neighborhood?
[49:34.210 --> 49:34.810]  And to be honest,
[49:35.010 --> 49:35.730]  you know, at least
[49:35.730 --> 49:36.570]  pickle them for me or
[49:36.570 --> 49:36.830]  something.
[49:37.230 --> 49:37.630]  What do you want?
[49:37.850 --> 49:38.790]  Does she want me to
[49:38.790 --> 49:39.630]  eat them as cucumbers
[49:39.630 --> 49:40.810]  or does she want me to
[49:40.810 --> 49:41.450]  take them the rest of
[49:41.450 --> 49:41.750]  the way?
[49:42.650 --> 49:43.490]  The note didn't
[49:43.490 --> 49:43.770]  specify.
[49:43.870 --> 49:44.010]  You can do whatever
[49:44.010 --> 49:44.370]  you want.
[49:45.490 --> 49:46.210]  You're given...
[49:46.210 --> 49:47.190]  What is the current?
[49:47.330 --> 49:48.190]  Do you still have them?
[49:48.330 --> 49:49.330]  Did you pass them on?
[49:50.110 --> 49:51.090]  Where are the cucumbers?
[49:51.110 --> 49:52.030]  They were passed on.
[49:52.510 --> 49:53.210]  And I will say,
[49:53.450 --> 49:54.930]  the note wasn't
[49:54.930 --> 49:55.510]  anywhere near the
[49:55.510 --> 49:56.910]  back, in my defense.
[49:57.410 --> 49:58.450]  It was three feet
[49:58.450 --> 49:59.050]  from the back.
[49:59.330 --> 50:00.850]  It was the only
[50:00.850 --> 50:01.830]  note on your
[50:01.830 --> 50:02.610]  board, dude.
[50:02.950 --> 50:03.850]  It wasn't like it was
[50:03.850 --> 50:04.570]  hidden in amongst
[50:04.570 --> 50:05.550]  all the other notes.
[50:05.810 --> 50:07.030]  I saw it instantly.
[50:07.190 --> 50:07.750]  It was a yellow
[50:07.750 --> 50:08.570]  post-it note.
[50:10.990 --> 50:11.770]  Alright, well, that's
[50:11.770 --> 50:12.370]  fair, you know.
[50:12.790 --> 50:13.530]  I'm in a hurry.
[50:14.010 --> 50:15.010]  That's true, you're
[50:15.010 --> 50:15.350]  in a hurry.
[50:15.890 --> 50:16.930]  The upside, though,
[50:17.570 --> 50:18.910]  the wasps have...
[50:18.910 --> 50:19.510]  the wasps that
[50:19.510 --> 50:20.290]  survived the fan,
[50:21.030 --> 50:22.070]  they're now happily
[50:22.070 --> 50:22.990]  living back inside
[50:22.990 --> 50:23.750]  the fan, and I've
[50:23.750 --> 50:24.250]  not turned it on
[50:24.250 --> 50:24.950]  since, and we're
[50:24.950 --> 50:25.670]  just coexisting
[50:25.670 --> 50:26.430]  peacefully.
[50:26.770 --> 50:27.250]  You'll be happy to
[50:27.250 --> 50:27.350]  know.
[50:27.650 --> 50:28.190]  That's great.
[50:28.650 --> 50:30.010]  I guess I am happy
[50:30.010 --> 50:30.250]  to know.
[50:30.350 --> 50:31.390]  You decided to go
[50:31.390 --> 50:32.170]  that route instead of
[50:32.170 --> 50:32.810]  removing them.
[50:33.190 --> 50:34.130]  Uh, I mean, they've
[50:34.130 --> 50:34.770]  been in there a while
[50:34.770 --> 50:35.630]  by the looks of it.
[50:35.850 --> 50:37.270]  Did you talk in the
[50:37.270 --> 50:38.330]  last podcast about how
[50:38.330 --> 50:39.470]  the crows are throwing
[50:39.470 --> 50:39.950]  shit at you?
[50:40.270 --> 50:41.410]  Oh, yeah, that was
[50:41.410 --> 50:42.130]  after the wasps,
[50:42.190 --> 50:42.450]  wasn't it?
[50:42.450 --> 50:42.690]  Yeah.
[50:42.890 --> 50:45.010]  I got like ravens or
[50:45.010 --> 50:45.230]  something.
[50:45.830 --> 50:46.430]  I don't know if it's a
[50:46.430 --> 50:47.230]  crow or a raven, I can
[50:47.230 --> 50:47.790]  never really tell.
[50:48.010 --> 50:49.030]  It's whatever the bird
[50:49.030 --> 50:49.430]  is that goes,
[50:49.690 --> 50:51.970]  ah, ah, ah, right?
[50:52.470 --> 50:52.790]  Yeah.
[50:53.450 --> 50:54.650]  So they're in my
[50:54.650 --> 50:56.230]  trees, and they just
[50:56.230 --> 50:57.810]  squawk at me every
[50:57.810 --> 50:58.570]  time they see me.
[50:58.610 --> 50:59.450]  If I walk into the
[50:59.450 --> 51:00.470]  backyard, they start
[51:00.470 --> 51:01.370]  just screaming at
[51:01.370 --> 51:01.570]  me.
[51:01.990 --> 51:03.230]  And as soon as they
[51:03.230 --> 51:03.850]  can't see me, they
[51:03.850 --> 51:04.170]  stop.
[51:04.310 --> 51:05.710]  It's like peekaboo with
[51:05.710 --> 51:06.550]  a baby, you know, you
[51:06.550 --> 51:07.230]  get that immediate
[51:07.230 --> 51:07.750]  reaction.
[51:07.950 --> 51:09.710]  And if I'm under them,
[51:10.130 --> 51:11.050]  they'll flap about in
[51:11.050 --> 51:12.370]  the trees and snap
[51:12.930 --> 51:13.990]  branches off and throw
[51:13.990 --> 51:14.630]  them at me.
[51:14.990 --> 51:15.030]  Huh.
[51:15.290 --> 51:16.170]  He's not kidding.
[51:16.450 --> 51:17.230]  He showed me a video.
[51:17.370 --> 51:18.050]  It is...
[51:18.050 --> 51:19.410]  It sounds impossible,
[51:19.810 --> 51:20.770]  but it is a hundred
[51:20.770 --> 51:21.790]  percent, like, it's
[51:21.790 --> 51:23.030]  obvious that they are
[51:23.030 --> 51:23.830]  attacking him.
[51:24.210 --> 51:24.530]  Why?
[51:24.750 --> 51:26.330]  What have you done,
[51:26.530 --> 51:26.710]  Gavin?
[51:26.910 --> 51:27.610]  What curse?
[51:27.830 --> 51:28.450]  What has happened?
[51:28.610 --> 51:29.470]  Why is everything
[51:29.470 --> 51:30.190]  against you?
[51:30.190 --> 51:31.790]  But does that explain
[51:31.790 --> 51:32.210]  the raven?
[51:32.230 --> 51:32.990]  Why would the raven
[51:32.990 --> 51:34.810]  crow attack your
[51:34.810 --> 51:35.030]  dead?
[51:35.470 --> 51:35.950]  I don't know.
[51:36.030 --> 51:36.670]  They're just around.
[51:37.330 --> 51:38.650]  Maybe it was like
[51:38.650 --> 51:39.550]  they had babies they
[51:39.550 --> 51:39.970]  were trying to
[51:39.970 --> 51:40.570]  protect or something,
[51:40.570 --> 51:41.350]  but it's too late.
[51:41.630 --> 51:42.170]  It's too late in the
[51:42.170 --> 51:42.390]  year.
[51:42.570 --> 51:43.450]  I already had baby
[51:43.450 --> 51:44.090]  birds like three
[51:44.090 --> 51:44.530]  months ago.
[51:44.750 --> 51:45.690]  Are you an expert on
[51:45.690 --> 51:47.150]  the mating cycle of
[51:47.150 --> 51:47.570]  crows?
[51:47.570 --> 51:48.490]  Yes, I'm an expert
[51:48.490 --> 51:49.450]  on the crow mating
[51:49.450 --> 51:49.670]  cycle.
[51:50.670 --> 51:51.050]  Maybe you should
[51:51.050 --> 51:51.550]  have taken the
[51:51.550 --> 51:51.890]  cucumbers.
[51:52.250 --> 51:52.770]  Maybe they're a
[51:52.770 --> 51:53.330]  peace offering.
[51:53.510 --> 51:53.890]  Maybe that would
[51:53.890 --> 51:54.650]  have solved everything.
[51:55.530 --> 51:56.630]  Also, based on what
[51:56.630 --> 51:58.210]  you said, how did
[51:58.210 --> 51:59.070]  she get the note
[51:59.070 --> 51:59.850]  to the door?
[52:00.070 --> 52:00.970]  Did she make a paper
[52:00.970 --> 52:01.970]  plane and throw it?
[52:02.070 --> 52:03.010]  How do you get the
[52:03.010 --> 52:03.350]  paper?
[52:04.010 --> 52:04.530]  If she just
[52:04.530 --> 52:05.970]  hooked, was the
[52:05.970 --> 52:06.810]  note tied to the
[52:06.810 --> 52:07.070]  bag?
[52:07.410 --> 52:09.470]  I assume she did
[52:09.470 --> 52:10.450]  the weird railing
[52:10.450 --> 52:11.230]  move, the little
[52:11.230 --> 52:12.490]  stealth move, and
[52:12.490 --> 52:13.550]  slid all of it, and
[52:13.550 --> 52:14.390]  the note just blew
[52:14.390 --> 52:15.270]  off the bag, I
[52:15.270 --> 52:16.210]  assume, when the
[52:16.210 --> 52:17.030]  wind took it to the
[52:17.030 --> 52:17.330]  door.
[52:17.730 --> 52:17.970]  Yeah.
[52:18.250 --> 52:18.770]  I mean, that's a
[52:18.770 --> 52:20.070]  nice thing as an
[52:20.070 --> 52:21.090]  idea, but I don't
[52:21.090 --> 52:21.810]  want to have to
[52:21.810 --> 52:22.590]  carry the cucumber.
[52:22.590 --> 52:23.370]  I would end up
[52:23.370 --> 52:24.150]  eating the cucumbers
[52:24.150 --> 52:25.650]  out of purely, I
[52:25.650 --> 52:26.270]  don't want to take
[52:26.270 --> 52:26.730]  it to the next
[52:26.730 --> 52:27.010]  house.
[52:27.150 --> 52:27.730]  Would you eat
[52:28.450 --> 52:29.250]  strange cucumber
[52:29.250 --> 52:29.950]  from someone you
[52:29.950 --> 52:30.430]  never met?
[52:30.670 --> 52:31.710]  If my options were
[52:31.710 --> 52:32.910]  eat strange cucumber
[52:32.910 --> 52:33.790]  from someone I've
[52:33.790 --> 52:34.610]  never met or
[52:34.610 --> 52:35.630]  deliver it to the
[52:35.630 --> 52:36.490]  next house, I'm
[52:36.490 --> 52:37.190]  eating the strange
[52:37.190 --> 52:37.330]  cucumber.
[52:40.970 --> 52:41.670]  There's no other
[52:41.670 --> 52:41.990]  option.
[52:42.370 --> 52:43.110]  You would just
[52:43.110 --> 52:43.670]  throw it away.
[52:44.310 --> 52:44.630]  No.
[52:44.850 --> 52:45.510]  Well, I would
[52:45.510 --> 52:45.690]  never.
[52:45.770 --> 52:46.150]  That would be a
[52:46.150 --> 52:46.390]  waste.
[52:46.570 --> 52:47.470]  But there needs to
[52:47.470 --> 52:48.470]  be a system on
[52:48.470 --> 52:48.950]  the note.
[52:49.250 --> 52:49.950]  You need to
[52:50.350 --> 52:51.350]  indicate, like,
[52:51.430 --> 52:52.030]  there needs to be a
[52:52.030 --> 52:52.990]  marking if you pass
[52:52.990 --> 52:53.250]  it on.
[52:53.330 --> 52:53.930]  I want to know how
[52:53.930 --> 52:55.010]  many houses this has
[52:55.010 --> 52:55.530]  gone through.
[52:55.830 --> 52:56.670]  How many blocks?
[52:56.810 --> 52:57.810]  Maybe this cucumber
[52:57.810 --> 52:58.710]  might not even be
[52:58.710 --> 52:59.370]  from my neighborhood.
[52:59.890 --> 53:00.590]  This could be three
[53:00.590 --> 53:01.230]  blocks over.
[53:01.530 --> 53:01.850]  They might not
[53:01.850 --> 53:02.510]  even be from her.
[53:02.610 --> 53:02.790]  Yeah.
[53:03.070 --> 53:03.330]  Yeah.
[53:03.510 --> 53:04.830]  It would be crazy
[53:04.830 --> 53:05.470]  if it was from her.
[53:05.590 --> 53:06.110]  I'd be shocked.
[53:06.370 --> 53:07.130]  I assume this has
[53:07.130 --> 53:07.970]  gone to multiple
[53:07.970 --> 53:08.330]  doors.
[53:08.370 --> 53:09.110]  Oh, dude, what
[53:09.110 --> 53:09.690]  if it's like it
[53:09.690 --> 53:10.950]  follows and she
[53:10.950 --> 53:11.850]  just passed a curse
[53:11.850 --> 53:12.190]  on you.
[53:12.270 --> 53:13.270]  The curse of the
[53:13.270 --> 53:13.490]  cucumber.
[53:13.910 --> 53:14.710]  And that's why the
[53:14.710 --> 53:15.690]  birds are flipping out.
[53:16.050 --> 53:16.830]  And now you've passed
[53:16.830 --> 53:17.230]  it on.
[53:17.370 --> 53:17.770]  I hope.
[53:18.430 --> 53:19.310]  I'm glad I got rid
[53:19.310 --> 53:19.830]  of it before.
[53:20.150 --> 53:20.710]  I didn't even touch
[53:20.710 --> 53:20.890]  him.
[53:21.270 --> 53:21.490]  Wow.
[53:22.130 --> 53:22.970]  He's in the clear.
[53:23.510 --> 53:24.130]  It follows.
[53:24.250 --> 53:25.130]  The cucumber it
[53:25.130 --> 53:25.930]  follows curse.
[53:26.370 --> 53:27.110]  The sequel we've
[53:27.110 --> 53:27.730]  always wanted.
[53:28.250 --> 53:29.070]  I love that the
[53:29.070 --> 53:29.930]  weirdness just comes
[53:29.930 --> 53:30.470]  from, like, the
[53:30.470 --> 53:31.310]  strange fruit, but
[53:31.310 --> 53:32.150]  Geoff, I think, was
[53:32.150 --> 53:33.290]  legitimately mad that
[53:33.290 --> 53:33.990]  there were cucumbers
[53:33.990 --> 53:34.790]  and not pickles.
[53:35.170 --> 53:35.490]  He was like,
[53:35.570 --> 53:36.510]  these aren't in
[53:36.510 --> 53:37.090]  brine.
[53:37.250 --> 53:38.070]  I was like, that's not
[53:38.070 --> 53:38.950]  the weird part,
[53:39.030 --> 53:39.230]  though.
[53:39.350 --> 53:40.090]  That's not the
[53:40.090 --> 53:40.950]  strangeness.
[53:41.250 --> 53:42.070]  You set it up all
[53:42.070 --> 53:42.470]  wrong.
[53:45.450 --> 53:46.650]  It's still weird.
[53:47.170 --> 53:48.250]  A bag of cucumbers
[53:48.250 --> 53:49.510]  from a garden is not
[53:49.510 --> 53:51.210]  as weird as a bag of
[53:51.210 --> 53:52.390]  pickles in brine.
[53:52.930 --> 53:53.990]  Why isn't that as
[53:53.990 --> 53:54.370]  weird?
[53:54.970 --> 53:55.510]  Who picked
[53:55.510 --> 53:55.690]  them?
[53:55.870 --> 53:57.050]  Come on, man.
[53:57.810 --> 53:58.810]  What do you mean?
[53:59.490 --> 54:00.250]  Is it just the act
[54:00.250 --> 54:00.830]  of, like, no one
[54:00.830 --> 54:01.630]  puts brine in a bag?
[54:01.630 --> 54:02.270]  You don't pickle
[54:02.270 --> 54:03.190]  shit in a bag.
[54:03.270 --> 54:03.470]  Yeah.
[54:03.590 --> 54:03.950]  Yeah.
[54:03.950 --> 54:04.170]  Yeah.
[54:04.170 --> 54:04.570]  You don't put
[54:04.570 --> 54:05.190]  brine in a bag.
[54:05.190 --> 54:06.250]  Everyone knows this.
[54:06.330 --> 54:06.890]  You'd have to take
[54:06.890 --> 54:07.670]  it out of a jar,
[54:07.790 --> 54:08.410]  which is already a
[54:08.410 --> 54:09.310]  transportation method.
[54:09.330 --> 54:10.010]  I still think that
[54:10.010 --> 54:10.950]  only takes it from,
[54:10.990 --> 54:11.910]  like, a six weird
[54:11.910 --> 54:12.710]  to a seven, though.
[54:14.510 --> 54:14.870]  Uh...
[54:14.870 --> 54:15.930]  No, I feel like a
[54:15.930 --> 54:17.270]  bag of cucumbers is
[54:17.270 --> 54:18.810]  a five and is,
[54:18.850 --> 54:20.250]  like, pickles with
[54:20.250 --> 54:21.450]  brine in a Ziploc's
[54:21.450 --> 54:22.390]  like a solid eight.
[54:22.570 --> 54:23.070]  Yeah, it's an eight.
[54:23.130 --> 54:24.050]  It's an easy eight.
[54:24.230 --> 54:24.490]  Really?
[54:24.870 --> 54:25.990]  It's a five to an
[54:25.990 --> 54:26.110]  eight?
[54:26.230 --> 54:26.630]  Eric, what are
[54:26.630 --> 54:26.890]  your thoughts?
[54:27.450 --> 54:28.670]  It's a huge gap
[54:28.670 --> 54:29.350]  because you have to
[54:29.350 --> 54:30.370]  take them out of the
[54:30.370 --> 54:30.730]  jar.
[54:31.190 --> 54:32.450]  It's just a weird thing.
[54:32.610 --> 54:32.830]  Yeah.
[54:32.830 --> 54:33.810]  I wanted to hear the
[54:33.810 --> 54:34.410]  rest of what Andrew
[54:34.410 --> 54:34.970]  had to say.
[54:35.570 --> 54:36.950]  Man, it really is...
[54:36.950 --> 54:37.930]  I just don't...
[54:37.930 --> 54:38.930]  You said that there
[54:38.930 --> 54:39.670]  was condensation
[54:39.670 --> 54:40.450]  inside the bag?
[54:40.630 --> 54:41.350]  Is that what you're
[54:41.350 --> 54:41.650]  saying?
[54:42.190 --> 54:42.770]  Yeah, that was the
[54:42.770 --> 54:43.670]  sheen I was looking at,
[54:43.730 --> 54:43.930]  I think.
[54:44.130 --> 54:46.090]  A very small amount
[54:46.090 --> 54:46.710]  of condensation.
[54:46.830 --> 54:47.110]  I think he's
[54:47.110 --> 54:47.730]  overselling it.
[54:47.810 --> 54:48.470]  Well, it was more
[54:48.470 --> 54:49.070]  when I left,
[54:49.510 --> 54:49.810]  in fairness.
[54:49.810 --> 54:50.110]  Where did the
[54:50.110 --> 54:51.070]  condensation go?
[54:51.550 --> 54:52.210]  Maybe into the
[54:52.210 --> 54:52.590]  cucumber.
[54:54.710 --> 54:55.290]  I don't know.
[54:55.790 --> 54:57.530]  What does everyone
[54:57.530 --> 54:58.250]  want from me?
[54:58.770 --> 54:59.570]  I'm trying to just
[54:59.570 --> 55:00.250]  live my life.
[55:00.250 --> 55:00.810]  I'll have a boat
[55:00.810 --> 55:01.510]  showing up.
[55:03.130 --> 55:04.290]  That sounds great.
[55:04.670 --> 55:05.410]  I mean, I
[55:05.410 --> 55:07.130]  have to believe
[55:07.130 --> 55:08.710]  that this is
[55:08.710 --> 55:10.090]  a Jacob's Ladder
[55:10.090 --> 55:12.470]  situation and you
[55:12.470 --> 55:14.310]  are dead and we
[55:14.310 --> 55:15.230]  are... when people
[55:15.230 --> 55:15.930]  talk about like
[55:15.930 --> 55:17.410]  simulation theory or
[55:17.410 --> 55:18.350]  whatever, like, oh,
[55:18.410 --> 55:18.930]  they're just like
[55:18.930 --> 55:19.290]  living in a
[55:19.290 --> 55:19.670]  simulation.
[55:19.930 --> 55:21.970]  I think that you
[55:21.970 --> 55:23.290]  died or you're in a
[55:23.290 --> 55:25.470]  helicopter dying and
[55:25.470 --> 55:27.610]  you are... this is... we
[55:27.610 --> 55:28.650]  are just inside your
[55:28.650 --> 55:30.230]  head and the woman
[55:30.230 --> 55:37.410]  This woman is a demon, and the cucumbers represent, like, you trying to get back to, like, the earthly realm.
[55:38.450 --> 55:46.430]  Like, why did she look like a witch from a video game? Like, a dream half-remembered from a video game from, like, long ago?
[55:46.710 --> 55:50.210]  You know what I mean? Like, it's too many... it's too many concentric circles.
[55:50.690 --> 55:58.450]  This is... I like where Eric is going with this. This is definitely... you are a Vietnam soldier, an American Vietnam soldier.
[55:58.450 --> 56:01.710]  You are bleeding out right now, and they are trying to save your life.
[56:01.850 --> 56:06.670]  And you're living... you're living the next 30 years in your mind, and we're just a part of it.
[56:06.730 --> 56:13.630]  Oh my god. And that lady that played the girl who turned into a demon, I think her name is Louise Pena, she died recently, too.
[56:14.010 --> 56:14.970]  So it's all unraveling.
[56:15.250 --> 56:16.190]  Huh. Interesting.
[56:16.550 --> 56:18.930]  Yeah, and she died, I think, of... I think she died of cirrhosis.
[56:19.950 --> 56:20.310]  Okay.
[56:21.070 --> 56:26.010]  I mean, in your head, I guess, because this is all... this is all invented by you.
[56:26.290 --> 56:27.290]  Oh, maybe she died of pickles!
[56:27.290 --> 56:28.850]  It all means something.
[56:29.370 --> 56:32.250]  If it was a different vegetable, would you have been more excited about it?
[56:32.630 --> 56:37.790]  Does the vegetable... is it... is the issue of you not wanting it the weirdness of receiving it randomly?
[56:38.130 --> 56:42.710]  Or is it the fact that cucumber is a lower tier on the vegetable list?
[56:43.030 --> 56:44.530]  Where do you put cucumber on the vegetable list?
[56:44.950 --> 56:49.050]  Cucumber... well, I mean... I feel like no one ever needs cucumber, is the thing.
[56:49.290 --> 56:52.510]  Cucumber is always, like, an addition. It's never a main.
[56:52.510 --> 56:58.930]  And also, America has these weird stubby little cucumbers to make pickles with, but I'm...
[56:58.930 --> 57:02.290]  The cucumbers I like to eat are the big, long ones. The ones that are, like, two feet long.
[57:02.590 --> 57:03.530]  Or a foot long.
[57:04.590 --> 57:07.910]  So I don't really know what I would have done with it. I mean, can you eat...
[57:07.910 --> 57:11.290]  Do the cucumbers that turn into pickles taste the same as, like, an English cucumber?
[57:12.010 --> 57:12.190]  Yeah.
[57:12.450 --> 57:16.710]  I'd assume so. I mean, hey, you could put that in a salad. You always got that as an option.
[57:18.070 --> 57:18.430]  Sandwiches?
[57:18.690 --> 57:20.010]  Cucumbers are fruit.
[57:20.010 --> 57:22.850]  I don't think a salad is a salad without cucumber, honestly.
[57:23.230 --> 57:23.530]  Really?
[57:23.950 --> 57:24.930]  It's a staple for me.
[57:25.350 --> 57:26.510]  Oh, I disagree strongly.
[57:26.670 --> 57:29.850]  Yeah, I love the cucumber, man. I could eat cucumber all day long.
[57:30.530 --> 57:33.150]  That's great, but I don't think they're needed for a salad.
[57:33.290 --> 57:37.170]  As I said, I feel like the salad is just the lettuce or the spinach or whatever you want to put.
[57:37.590 --> 57:40.370]  It's the blank canvas, and then you put whatever you want into it.
[57:40.510 --> 57:42.170]  Yeah, why do you never make that, then?
[57:42.650 --> 57:43.190]  Who are you talking to?
[57:43.490 --> 57:45.710]  Why does Andrew never make the bulk standard salad?
[57:45.710 --> 57:52.890]  Well, I do. I wanted to make the greatest salad possible to enhance the cream, potentially.
[57:53.290 --> 57:58.670]  Or, like, I've never had this before. If I'm not going to like it in this salad, I'll never like it outside of it.
[57:58.950 --> 57:59.310]  Interesting.
[57:59.490 --> 57:59.710]  Slicing.
[58:00.050 --> 58:06.270]  You know what we should do? We should come up with... I'm not saying we should do it right now, because we should put some thought into it.
[58:06.550 --> 58:15.290]  But we should pick a number of ingredients, like five or six or something, and then we all come up with the perfect salad in our minds, right?
[58:15.290 --> 58:20.170]  Like, you pick whatever six ingredients, and you create the perfect salad. I do, and then Gavin does the same.
[58:20.310 --> 58:23.450]  And then we can release it, and then let the audience decide which is the best salad.
[58:23.470 --> 58:24.930]  Is this for the recipe book?
[58:25.250 --> 58:28.870]  Could be for the recipe book, yeah. And then we call that the ultimate, like, f***face salad or something.
[58:29.230 --> 58:31.130]  Do we have to do it anonymously?
[58:31.470 --> 58:32.650]  We would have to do it anonymously.
[58:32.990 --> 58:38.990]  I feel like salad has the greatest range. Salad can be amazing, and it can be such dogshit.
[58:39.250 --> 58:39.790]  Totally agree.
[58:39.790 --> 58:46.050]  It's a great, yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to think of what is a more ranged food. I think you might be right. I think it has the widest range.
[58:46.410 --> 58:52.930]  Whereas, like, stuff like eggs. Eggs could be, like, okay or good, but that you... oh, maybe that's a bad example.
[58:53.370 --> 58:59.970]  No, but I think it's a good example. It can also... it's an appetizer, or it's a meal, a main, like, however you want to present it. It's got a lot of flexibility.
[59:00.450 --> 59:06.490]  I feel the same way about honey mustard. I feel like that's the condiment, wide range. There's such a variety of honey mustard flavors.
[59:07.170 --> 59:12.730]  More so than any other condiment, you can go place to place and have wildly different tasting experiences.
[59:12.910 --> 59:18.250]  I'd be willing to bet this is the fifth f*** face that you've mentioned honey mustard. You really like honey mustard.
[59:18.370 --> 59:20.370]  You really do. Yeah, it comes up a lot.
[59:20.410 --> 59:27.410]  Well, we did a sauce thing, and I don't know if I'd say it comes up a lot. What was the last mention of honey mustard when I wanted to make honey mustard?
[59:27.750 --> 59:30.730]  That was a long time ago. Like, probably 20, 30 episodes ago.
[59:30.790 --> 59:32.690]  No way. No, it's in the last 10.
[59:32.690 --> 59:37.170]  You brought up things that have wide variety. I think honey mustard has wide variety.
[59:37.350 --> 59:38.770]  I was just trying to think of other food items.
[59:38.770 --> 59:40.350]  Next week I'm going to talk about something brown.
[59:41.510 --> 59:44.910]  Nobody's disagreeing. We're just pointing out that it comes up a lot.
[59:45.130 --> 59:48.150]  I don't feel like it does. I think it's just memorable when I bring it up.
[59:48.530 --> 59:50.370]  I think it's a great topic that everybody enjoys.
[59:51.610 --> 59:54.770]  We always engage really well in your honey mustard conversations.
[59:54.790 --> 59:58.530]  Yeah, you do. I always get a text after on those episodes, so that was a great show.
[59:58.830 --> 01:00:02.290]  I'm trying to sprinkle it in honey mustard whenever I can. It really elevates it.
[01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:03.890]  Much like the condiment.
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:07.630]  Yeah, it elevates the dish. It elevates the show.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.890]  Little honey mustard talk.
[01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.770]  Do you think I should become a better neighbor and start dumping food on my neighbor's doorsteps?
[01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:14.630]  That's such a great question.
[01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:17.590]  I don't know what the cucumber rebuttal would be.
[01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.510]  Well, I think you get something that you grew in your own garden.
[01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:24.450]  Here's the problem. You don't know where she lives.
[01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.510]  Is she to your left or right? The last person that did it.
[01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.110]  She's from my garage.
[01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:30.630]  She came from under the house.
[01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:34.210]  She might be a Sleestack.
[01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.490]  How do you do this in a way that isn't an invasion of privacy?
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:48.550]  It'd be interesting to put one thing to the left of you, one thing to the right of you, and see how far it gets both ways.
[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.290]  Do you like a race of sorts?
[01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.450]  I bet you that is almost like a competition in itself.
[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:58.530]  We have to pick the shittiest vegetable we can think of and see how far it can get.
[01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.110]  And whoever gets the furthest wins.
[01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:03.550]  Like a game of vegetable telephone?
[01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:09.710]  Yeah, exactly. I would never pick... carrots or potatoes are not getting past two houses.
[01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:10.950]  Why? Because people are going to eat them?
[01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:15.070]  Yeah, people are going to like those items. Those are commonly used great vegetables.
[01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:21.110]  Can it be... I bet I could get a Branston pickle jar really far. I bet that would travel.
[01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:22.690]  No one's going to want that.
[01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:26.050]  People are going to throw that away because they don't trust it.
[01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:28.010]  Nobody knows what it is.
[01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:29.730]  And it's like store-bought.
[01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:35.050]  Yeah, I don't think you can do store-bought. I think it has to be... it can't be fruit because it just bruises.
[01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.410]  It has to be like a vegetable with some durability.
[01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:40.990]  You're not going to fucking deal with apples in a bag, Geoff.
[01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:42.370]  Like, let's just... we can't do fruit.
[01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:43.290]  What about a swede?
[01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:44.550]  What's a swede?
[01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.670]  Yeah, what is that?
[01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:47.150]  It's a root veg, isn't it?
[01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:50.050]  No idea what it is. No clue.
[01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.890]  A swedish person?
[01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.030]  Oh, let me see. Swede...
[01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.210]  Swede veg.
[01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:59.510]  Why do we talk about vegetables so much?
[01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:01.210]  I don't know. You bring it up every week.
[01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.630]  It's a cross between a cabbage and a turnip.
[01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:09.210]  Oh, you call it a rutabaga. What the hell?
[01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:11.690]  Hold on, hold on. Damn it, Andrew.
[01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:13.170]  How were you going to say that?
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.690]  I was going to say, it doesn't matter because Andrew told me that it's root...
[01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.030]  I was going to say rutabaga.
[01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:24.090]  What's a rutabaga?
[01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:25.790]  A rutabaga. It's a root vegetable.
[01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.030]  It's a swede.
[01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:31.470]  Wait, how do you spell your version?
[01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.150]  Write it out. I want to see what this looks like.
[01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:36.310]  Because rutabaga...
[01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:37.610]  Yeah, that's a swedish person.
[01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.070]  Yeah, it's not...
[01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.890]  It's a swedish turnip, isn't it?
[01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:43.490]  I don't know if it's from Sweden.
[01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.130]  It's a rutabaga.
[01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.190]  A rutabaga is such a better name.
[01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.390]  Where does that name come from?
[01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.210]  I don't know, but it's great. It's fun.
[01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:53.090]  When you say rutabaga, you know what you're talking about.
[01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:53.790]  You don't have to go away.
[01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.530]  Some woman on the street would come up to me and say,
[01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:58.070]  I want to talk to you about rutabagas.
[01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:59.190]  And I'd be like, cool, what's that?
[01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.810]  And she'd tell me to go shove it up my ass.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.380]  Rutabagas...
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.120]  I don't even think I like rutabagas,
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.780]  but it's just exciting to hear.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.260]  When I hear rutabagas in the mix, yeah, I'm amped about it.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:13.700]  I want it.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.460]  Rutabagas are fucking awesome.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:16.900]  Rutabaga.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.480]  I don't know if I've had a rutabaga.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.400]  Okay.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.400]  This comes from the Swedish dialectal word
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:24.780]  Rotabaggy.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.740]  From root and lump.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:33.800]  Root lump.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.860]  Dude, call it root lumps.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.600]  That's way better than either.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.220]  Lump root.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:43.640]  Root!
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.440]  Root lump is going to a different city.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.140]  Nobody's touching root lump.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.480]  I'm bagging up my root lumps
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.220]  and I'm putting them on the neighbor's doorstep
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.640]  and they're going far.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.240]  I wonder if you could
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.480]  have a vegetable so undesirable
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.200]  that it makes its way back to you.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.460]  All the way around the house?
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.460]  Like a circle, all the way around the neighborhood.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.730]  It goes out to the left and it comes in from the right.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.020]  It would go north all the way to Texas.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.180]  Do you know what's awesome about this episode?
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.380]  Because we're going to have to do another one right after this.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.160]  And I was afraid we wouldn't have anything to talk about.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.220]  I didn't talk about any of my shit.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.360]  I had no idea we were going to go so heavy into rutabagas.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:26.880]  This is awesome.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.500]  We went from sleestacks to rutabagas.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.780]  Was it you, Geoff, who thought Andre 3000
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.600]  was saying sleestacks
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:37.780]  in that song?
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.560]  Yeah, it still sounds like it to me.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.740]  Keep your heart three...
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.200]  Keep your heart, sleestack.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.500]  That's still how I sing it.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.440]  These girls are smart, sleestack.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.680]  Keep your heart, sleestack.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.740]  He's into science fiction and stuff.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.500]  We should wrap this up.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.020]  Alright.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.800]  Well, you've done it again.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.380]  You've listened to another hour of the
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.720]  F*** Face podcast.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.700]  An hour and five minutes today.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.140]  Hey, we appreciate that.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.080]  Thanks for doing it.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:09.760]  Why would you say that?
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.220]  It's going to get edited.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.920]  It's going to be less than what you just said.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:15.660]  That's a good point.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.980]  We're definitely cutting out the jack shit.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.160]  Jack stuff is great.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.480]  I think it's even better that we cut him out.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.560]  He's going to be waiting.
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.500]  But we should leave this bit in.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.180]  Absolutely.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:32.780]  Alright.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.980]  Well, let's stop doing this.
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.320]  The audience...
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.040]  Here's what's going to happen.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.220]  We're all going to stop, hit stop, and then we're going to hit start.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.040]  And we're going to do another podcast right now.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.680]  But you're going to go to
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.780]  wherever you listen to podcasts.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.420]  Probably iTunes or Spotify or some shit.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.260]  And then you're going to enter in the longest,
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.580]  most verbose, most glowing
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.500]  review of F*** Face.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.100]  Or you won't.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.060]  I don't give a shit.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.780]  No, we do. It'd be nice if you did.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:01.160]  We'd rather you did. We do care.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.680]  Yeah, but I don't want to tell you what to do. You do whatever you want to do.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.200]  If the mood strikes you,
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.780]  write a review. Give us some stars.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.840]  Maybe bag up some root vegetables
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.920]  and meet a neighbor.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.620]  I don't know.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.740]  Maybe don't try to
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.120]  break into the pentagon
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.260]  to put them on their front porch.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.280]  Maybe just walk up the steps that are there.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.360]  And don't be all secretive about it.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:24.900]  Or maybe do. Freak them out.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.000]  I don't think you know
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.040]  that there's a difference between not giving a shit
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.860]  and being open to people doing what they want.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.340]  Those are two very different things.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.440]  I don't know. Are they?
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.120]  I'm not their boss.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.660]  I can make suggestions, but I can't.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.920]  But then it's like, who am I to tell you what to do?
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.540]  You do whatever you want to do.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.960]  I mean, you are the host of the show.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.400]  You know what? We haven't had a show that wouldn't end properly
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.600]  in the whole of season two.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.480]  We're back at it. We've had the yelling.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.200]  I guess this is year two, not season two.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.720]  No, that's a good question.
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.180]  We're definitely in year two, but have we had an episode
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.440]  that wouldn't end in season two? Season two is a little longer
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.220]  than year two. I think so, because season two
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.200]  has been going for over
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.660]  20 episodes, I think. Well here, let me tease
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.800]  what I want to talk about next week.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.540]  I'd like to talk about...
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.120]  I had sort of a shit triangle happen
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.080]  in the last couple days, but it has
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.480]  led me to a new
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.560]  understanding of my place in the universe.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.720]  And I'm pretty...
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.840]  I'm okay with it. Are you dead as well?
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.120]  No, no, I'm not dead.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.240]  On the inside, maybe a little bit.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.780]  And you can find out more on the next episode
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.060]  of F*** Your Face. Goodbye!
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.700]  He's right. And tune in next week
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.920]  when I'll talk about my tooth, and what happened
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.900]  to my charger cheek, and I learned
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.780]  a new bike trick, and I'm a
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.520]  chain guy now. F*** your face out.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.380]  What?
