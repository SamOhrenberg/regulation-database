[00:34.310 --> 00:41.590]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. I believe it is the 60th
[00:41.590 --> 00:47.530]  iteration of this show. With me, as always, Andrew and Gavin. And I think Nick is out
[00:47.530 --> 00:51.990]  this episode, but Eric is hiding somewhere in the background. It's been about four minutes
[00:51.990 --> 00:56.990]  since we last spoke. How's everybody doing? How have you been? I missed you guys. Missed
[00:56.990 --> 01:01.350]  you too. I went to talk to you, Geoff. I didn't know you left about the Celtics coach. There's
[01:01.350 --> 01:05.990]  no... nothing. Heard nothing. I like the guy. I'm in. I was unsure at first. Yeah, I'm a
[01:05.990 --> 01:09.910]  big fan. Andrew, do you struggle when people are talking to you, but you're doing something
[01:09.910 --> 01:14.190]  else? Do you just block out the rest of the world? Because I feel like he was very loudly
[01:14.190 --> 01:19.170]  like, I'm going to go pee. I heard you only, and then I thought it was just you. Yeah,
[01:19.290 --> 01:23.370]  I don't know. I guess so. Maybe. If I did, would I know? I don't think I would know.
[01:23.450 --> 01:28.910]  I think someone else would have to. Listen, I'll be honest. I'm well aware of who I am
[01:28.910 --> 01:33.310]  and how I come across. I'm pretty easy to ignore. I've had 46 years of it. I get it.
[01:34.290 --> 01:38.090]  I'm used to it. It's kind of like, and by the way, let me just say, I mentioned to you
[01:38.090 --> 01:42.970]  guys like two or three episodes ago now that I came to peace with my space, my station
[01:42.970 --> 01:47.750]  in the universe, which is like, I am of the level of dog shit. And as long as I don't
[01:47.750 --> 01:52.210]  try to go above that, then things are fine. And I just want you guys to know, it's been
[01:52.210 --> 01:58.710]  going great. Like, still, universe and I, we're still seeing eye to eye. No major tragedies.
[01:58.830 --> 02:01.730]  The house hasn't fallen apart. You know, we did a little bit of rain because Gavin and
[02:01.730 --> 02:06.770]  I hung out, but I've been reminding myself when I see shit, I'm no better than shit. And
[02:06.770 --> 02:11.110]  then I pick it up immediately and I deal with the shit. And, uh, it's been great.
[02:11.230 --> 02:15.930]  It's been fine. That's, uh, really learned to settle with where I am and not, not try
[02:15.930 --> 02:21.310]  to be, oh, you know, better. Should we have a, I'm no better than shit t-shirt? I'm no
[02:21.310 --> 02:24.830]  better than shit. What would be the design on it? Well, the design, I assume would just
[02:24.830 --> 02:28.930]  be text. You don't think, I feel like there has to be a design. Wait, what's Eric saying?
[02:29.110 --> 02:32.810]  Said the same before everything fell apart last time. I feel like this is the stuff I
[02:32.810 --> 02:37.450]  said after everything fell apart and I had the realization. No, no. This was one thing
[02:37.450 --> 02:44.450]  happened with your car and then everything happened after that. The car happened and
[02:44.450 --> 02:49.110]  then you went, you know what? I'm just going to take it as it comes. And then the next
[02:49.110 --> 02:55.150]  month of episodes, it came. Yeah, it all came. So something to consider. I don't know, man.
[02:55.310 --> 02:59.950]  I've got a new shitty lease on life. So when Eric said, this is the same stuff you said
[02:59.950 --> 03:03.770]  before everything fell apart last time, I thought he meant Vin Diesel. Yeah, I thought
[03:03.770 --> 03:07.390]  the same thing. I was like, is the episode going downhill? Yeah, so I thought it was
[03:07.390 --> 03:11.290]  a Vin Diesel reference. And then that made me think, holy shit, Gavin's right. I don't
[03:11.290 --> 03:16.470]  remember any of this conversation said last episode. I guess I wasn't listening. I was
[03:16.470 --> 03:21.290]  pretty sure this is all new, but you meant the car. Geoff's life fell apart. Not the episode.
[03:21.910 --> 03:27.850]  Less important. Understood. You know who else? I didn't know this. So I made the Zimmer,
[03:27.850 --> 03:32.090]  the dinner Zimmer salad last episode. Not to be confused with the regulation Zimmer
[03:32.090 --> 03:37.750]  salad or the regulation salad. Yeah. No. Yeah. So I was doing a lot of research about Don
[03:37.750 --> 03:42.550]  Zimmer and I didn't know. I didn't. Did you know that he almost died when he was like
[03:42.550 --> 03:47.270]  in his 20s from a baseball? I had no idea. Yeah. Like cracked his skull. Right. He was
[03:47.270 --> 03:52.950]  in a coma for two weeks. Whoa. Yeah. No. Yeah. He was he was unconscious for 13 days and
[03:52.950 --> 03:57.450]  his weight plummeted from 170 to 124. And they told him he'd never play again when he
[03:57.450 --> 04:03.530]  was 22. Oh, my God. He took like a fastball to the face. They had to drill holes into his skull
[04:03.530 --> 04:08.590]  to relieve the pressure so that he could survive. He had fluid. Yeah, I guess he had fluid. This
[04:08.590 --> 04:14.230]  then created there was a rumor for a while that he had a titanium plate put into his head. And
[04:14.230 --> 04:18.690]  I feel like those rumors were fully from when he had his fight because he went head first. I feel
[04:18.690 --> 04:23.990]  like the logic was that he was trying to use his titanium. Yeah. That like he was trying to utilize
[04:23.990 --> 04:29.650]  the weapon that he was given using the titanium forehead. It was not. He does not have a titanium
[04:29.650 --> 04:34.130]  forehead. They did put like some screws or like buttons or something in there. I bet he believed
[04:34.130 --> 04:39.890]  he had a titanium head. Although immediately disarmed when your head just gets pushed into
[04:39.890 --> 04:44.090]  the ground. My favorite part of when I was doing research, the thing I was reading, they wrote out
[04:44.090 --> 04:49.070]  like he was hit. He's fully unconscious for 13 days like he nearly died. And then they followed
[04:49.070 --> 04:56.070]  up with he was beaned again in 1956. Only getting hit in the head with a baseball bean is hilarious
[04:56.070 --> 05:01.310]  to me. I love beanings. It's a great word. It must be such a jarring feeling, though,
[05:01.350 --> 05:05.750]  to be playing baseball, get hit in the head, and then it's two weeks later. What must that feel
[05:05.750 --> 05:10.030]  like? Oh, my God. I don't. Oh, he wouldn't have felt the ball. I don't imagine. It's immediately
[05:10.030 --> 05:15.850]  out. Is that a strikeout? How does that count? Or does he go to base? Yeah, that's that's that's
[05:15.850 --> 05:19.650]  it's all based on ball, right? Yeah. They'll probably have to put in a pinch runner for you
[05:19.650 --> 05:24.610]  while they carry off in a stretcher. It's an HPP. It's hit by pitch. OK, we should run an experiment.
[05:24.750 --> 05:30.850]  We'll get hit Gavin in the head with a fastball. Oh, and then two weeks later, we'll ask him what
[05:30.850 --> 05:35.550]  he remembers. Don't they wear helmets, though, playing baseball? They do. Or was that so far
[05:35.550 --> 05:40.410]  in the past that helmets hadn't been invented? Well, I'm sure helmets were invented by that
[05:40.410 --> 05:44.650]  point. I don't know if they use them. That's another question entirely. But helmets certainly
[05:44.650 --> 05:49.590]  existed. I can't believe like when you look back on the way stuff evolved technology wise,
[05:49.790 --> 05:56.170]  I can't believe seatbelts weren't a thing for so long. It's mental to me. I think.
[05:56.630 --> 06:03.170]  Fuck dude. Surely the first car crash killed the driver. Surely. I remember when Gus and I were
[06:03.170 --> 06:08.490]  into we had we both had old cars for a while. This is early RT and before RT. And I remember
[06:08.490 --> 06:14.010]  like one of Gus's trucks, I think, didn't have seatbelts and it wasn't required to
[06:14.010 --> 06:18.330]  because like they didn't have to. He wasn't legally required to have them because they
[06:18.330 --> 06:23.190]  weren't required at the time that the truck was built or something. And so they just didn't
[06:23.190 --> 06:28.190]  exist. And so it was OK. But it was like I think I'm getting that right. But it was like a 63 or
[06:28.190 --> 06:33.370]  a 64 truck. So it wasn't that old. Oh, I'm sure at the time, maybe the way the cars were built
[06:33.370 --> 06:38.870]  in general, maybe seatbelts would have been a death sentence when they're attached to the way
[06:38.870 --> 06:42.770]  that they used to be built. Like they would have just ripped you in half. Well, also shit like car
[06:42.770 --> 06:46.850]  seats. Like my mom. I don't think I had a car seat when I was a kid because I was born in the 70s.
[06:46.890 --> 06:50.510]  Right. And my mom was like, the car seat was the fucking floorboard. They just throw you on the
[06:50.510 --> 06:55.510]  floorboard with a pillow and some blankets. And you just don't hit shit. You know,
[06:56.830 --> 07:00.170]  you know, when there's like something on the floor of a car and you break hard and then like
[07:00.170 --> 07:03.850]  a bottle might roll out so you can see your baby's head.
[07:04.990 --> 07:07.650]  Poke it out. Covered in old Skittles and shit.
[07:11.710 --> 07:14.090]  Oh, Geoffrey, what are you doing under there? Get back there.
[07:19.450 --> 07:24.030]  I was wildly wrong. I did not think you're going to go with seatbelts. I thought you're
[07:24.030 --> 07:27.510]  going to stay within the realm of sports with like hockey. How goalies didn't wear
[07:27.510 --> 07:32.030]  masks for a long time. Like I was all prepared for that. It was a much more impactful choice.
[07:32.230 --> 07:37.110]  Oh, no, I'm just thinking like safety in general was just so secondary. Now stuff's
[07:37.110 --> 07:41.730]  built around safety. Speaking of not wearing helmets and masks, I'll tell you who should
[07:41.730 --> 07:46.330]  is fucking Devin Booker. I have watched Gav. This is he's a basketball player. It's the playoffs
[07:46.330 --> 07:51.730]  right now. He got hit in the first game of a series or maybe second game, and he had his nose broken
[07:51.730 --> 07:58.050]  in three places. So then he started wearing like a face shield, but it's hard to shoot with it on
[07:58.050 --> 08:02.410]  or whatever. It's uncomfortable. So he keeps taking it off. And I swear to God, every time he takes
[08:02.410 --> 08:06.010]  that shield off and walks on the court, somebody punches him as hard as they can straight in his
[08:06.010 --> 08:12.270]  fucking nose. Happened last night again. He was on the ground covered. He covered his face with
[08:12.270 --> 08:17.350]  his shirt to cry. He was in so much pain. And it's like, dude, put the fucking mask back on.
[08:17.750 --> 08:21.210]  Yeah, I mean, that's something that I guess when your nose is broken in three places, even with
[08:21.210 --> 08:25.790]  the mask, it's going to hurt. I can't imagine without it. I didn't realize the nose is a
[08:25.790 --> 08:30.110]  nose bone is big enough to break in three places. Can't break mine. I have an unbreakable nose.
[08:30.210 --> 08:36.330]  We've covered this. That's true. I don't need the mask. I'll never need it. I think if I was a bad
[08:36.330 --> 08:41.030]  shooter, though, I'd wear a mask season like every every season. I just come up with like I broke.
[08:41.290 --> 08:45.370]  I guess I'd have to come up with a different excuse. How many times have you been hit in the
[08:45.370 --> 08:49.850]  nose? Punched like punched or like what do you mean? Well, just taking a blow to the nose. Oh,
[08:49.850 --> 08:54.930]  I don't. It just bounces right off. So I couldn't tell you the number. It doesn't really matter.
[08:55.050 --> 08:59.310]  I've never like sustained a bad injury. I'm saying like anything that impacts the nose.
[08:59.430 --> 09:04.510]  It does no damage. It just keeps on moving. Anything that impacts the nose does no damage.
[09:05.090 --> 09:12.150]  Yeah. Are you serious, dude? I hit my fucking nose so hard an hour and a half ago I almost blacked
[09:12.150 --> 09:18.830]  out. I don't know what I have like the Anderson Silva of noses like it just bobs and like you
[09:18.830 --> 09:23.110]  can't like when it hits it's not like direct. You're not providing any information about your
[09:23.110 --> 09:28.750]  impacts to the nose. You're just it's like saying, oh, this this pint glass unstoppable. I'm saying
[09:28.750 --> 09:34.790]  that like when things when things hit the nose, it like somehow deflects it and it does minimal
[09:34.790 --> 09:39.650]  damage. Like I don't there's nothing I couldn't tell you. I know I've been hit in the nose by
[09:39.650 --> 09:43.590]  things. It just means you haven't been hit very hard in the nose. No, I definitely I'm telling
[09:43.590 --> 09:50.630]  when we like like the pint glass in my cupboard has never broken. Does not mean if I throw it
[09:50.630 --> 09:54.890]  at the wall, it's going to stay in one piece. What are you talking about? Yeah, dude, I can
[09:54.890 --> 10:01.530]  come to Austin. I got a watering can here. Hit that hit yourself in the nose with that. And I
[10:01.530 --> 10:06.210]  guarantee you'll feel it. You'll feel your nose go back into your brain. Did you fall into your
[10:07.450 --> 10:15.650]  dude earlier? I was late arrow. Well, it's not but arrow was out in the backyard and she peed
[10:15.650 --> 10:21.250]  like on the on the patio, like on the concrete and not in the grass. And so I spray it off.
[10:21.350 --> 10:26.030]  Otherwise it the sun bakes it into hot, dry piss smell, which is fucking unbearable.
[10:26.330 --> 10:31.170]  So anytime she does it, I go grab the hose and I spray it off, you know. And so I went to the hose.
[10:31.270 --> 10:35.470]  I grabbed the hose and I bit down to turn it on. And I guess right next to it, I was a little like
[10:35.470 --> 10:41.070]  little bench. And it had a watering can on it. And I fucking didn't see it. And I hit that
[10:41.070 --> 10:46.050]  watering can like the spout at the bottom of my nose as hard as I could bend it down.
[10:46.190 --> 10:50.930]  And then to add insult to injury. So like it shoves my nose up into my brain a little bit.
[10:50.990 --> 10:55.830]  So I can I don't remember some things. I'm pretty sure. But I definitely lost some knowledge in
[10:55.830 --> 11:01.170]  that. But then to add insult to injury, because it's a watering can and I hit the spout, the force
[11:01.170 --> 11:06.470]  pushed it down so that the handle of the watering can, the watering can tipped. And then the top of
[11:06.470 --> 11:10.890]  the watering can hit me in the back of the head at the same time. So I like double whapped myself.
[11:12.790 --> 11:18.110]  How's the nose doing? It hurt, but it's fine now. I'm going to be fine the entire time.
[11:18.550 --> 11:22.950]  No worries. I would love to see. I would love to see you do that next time I'm in person.
[11:23.190 --> 11:27.950]  You can feel my nose. You're going to feel the dexterity of it, the movement. It's very bendable.
[11:28.430 --> 11:33.410]  I've got a great damage resistant nose. You know what? You guys keep talking. I'm going to do
[11:33.410 --> 11:37.370]  something. I'll be right back. You guys continue without me. Okay. What do you think Geoff's going
[11:37.370 --> 11:41.070]  to go do, Gavin? Maybe he's going to get the watering can. Maybe he's going to get a soda
[11:41.070 --> 11:47.850]  and actually do it for the first time. Actually chug a soda. I just feel like there's a lot of
[11:47.850 --> 11:52.130]  bones that you haven't broken. But for some reason you dwell on the nose as being the one
[11:52.130 --> 11:56.490]  that's indestructible. Well, because like you haven't felt my nose. If you feel my nose,
[11:57.230 --> 12:03.570]  I haven't felt anyone's nose. Well, I'm telling you, mine is very flexible. What am I going to
[12:03.570 --> 12:07.850]  get out of like shoving my thumb against your nose though? It's just going to feel like a...
[12:07.850 --> 12:12.670]  What do you mean? No, the flexibility of it, the lack of damage. I feel like it's kind of
[12:12.670 --> 12:18.230]  shelled in a way that would make it very difficult to break in any angle. It's a very durable nose.
[12:18.790 --> 12:23.330]  Everything else would fall apart around it. I'm not saying I'm invulnerable. As I said before,
[12:23.330 --> 12:26.690]  if I got hit by a missile, it would hold, but everything else would go away.
[12:28.950 --> 12:32.450]  Eric just asked, do we think Geoff's coming back? I do think Geoff's coming back. Yeah,
[12:32.530 --> 12:36.450]  yeah, he's coming back. I don't know what he's doing though. Is he getting the watering can?
[12:36.590 --> 12:39.510]  Do you think he's going to hit himself? There's no way he's going to hit himself with the watering
[12:39.510 --> 12:42.530]  can. I think I'm really going to have to talk him into doing this bike stunt. You know,
[12:42.550 --> 12:46.290]  like the way he was talking about it, I kind of got the impression he was saying like it
[12:46.290 --> 12:49.590]  wasn't going to be worth it. It wasn't gonna be worth the effort. It's not going to be very good.
[12:49.590 --> 12:54.510]  In my head, that's what makes it better. Like if we go to all the effort and then he gets like
[12:54.510 --> 13:00.730]  two inches of air. Yeah. The least impressive it is, the funnier it is. That's what I was saying.
[13:00.790 --> 13:05.010]  Yeah. You want it to be bottom of the barrel, like barely, like he gets a little bit of air
[13:05.010 --> 13:09.890]  in a Phantom camera in the slow-mo. The fact that you were getting so excited as well,
[13:10.090 --> 13:14.310]  just by thinking that we might be doing it, I've really been pushing to get it done.
[13:14.550 --> 13:18.350]  It just feels like something two seven-year-olds would do. You haven't been pushing that hard,
[13:18.350 --> 13:21.550]  dude. I've been, because you were trying to talk, you were trying to talk us out of it.
[13:21.610 --> 13:24.350]  And I was like, look, it's going to be good either way. What did you go do, Geoff?
[13:25.510 --> 13:29.430]  I felt like I didn't do a good job of illustrating what was going on with the
[13:29.430 --> 13:34.810]  watering can. So I took a picture to show you how I, how I hit myself twice.
[13:35.250 --> 13:39.690]  Oh, it's like really narrow on the end. That looks like it could have cut you really badly.
[13:40.410 --> 13:44.390]  So that's what I did. And so when I hit it, then my nose hit the spout,
[13:44.390 --> 13:47.870]  knocked the other part up into my brain. It's like an extreme netty part.
[13:48.330 --> 13:54.130]  Yeah. But see, if you look, look at Geoff's nose, that's a very breakable looking nose to me.
[13:54.330 --> 13:58.130]  Yours as well, Gavin. It's kind of, there's like a large area for where it could break.
[13:58.430 --> 14:01.190]  What are you trying to say? It's extended. I'm saying it's not like,
[14:01.350 --> 14:05.150]  I have a flatter, smaller nose. There's just not a lot of room for it to move.
[14:05.450 --> 14:09.190]  Did the top of the watering can also hit you in the forehead from the angle, or is it just the nose?
[14:10.030 --> 14:14.370]  Yeah, no, that's what I was trying to illustrate to you guys, is that when I hit it with my nose,
[14:14.390 --> 14:18.410]  it kicked the rest of it in, and then it hit me in the forehead and the top of the head.
[14:18.650 --> 14:22.070]  So technically, I guess I get hit in three spots by one watering can.
[14:23.590 --> 14:25.510]  I just don't know how you don't see that.
[14:26.310 --> 14:29.150]  Well, like you said, Gavin,
[14:29.330 --> 14:30.450]  You bend down with your eyes closed.
[14:30.770 --> 14:34.690]  The watering can, the spout is thin and long and black,
[14:34.710 --> 14:37.930]  and I was bending down into grass. It just didn't stick out to me.
[14:39.770 --> 14:43.010]  You've got to put up a security camera or something so we can watch.
[14:43.010 --> 14:47.450]  I didn't even fucking realize this was going to be content, but yeah,
[14:47.750 --> 14:51.390]  I didn't even think to mention it until Andrew started talking about his unbreakable nose.
[14:52.250 --> 14:57.050]  You got assaulted by your watering can. How is that not content? It's amazing.
[14:57.410 --> 15:02.010]  It didn't rise to- it didn't stand out to me until you mentioned your unbreakable nose.
[15:02.390 --> 15:04.890]  Why do you even have a watering can like that if you have a hose?
[15:05.230 --> 15:07.630]  Uh, to water potted plants and stuff?
[15:07.930 --> 15:09.030]  Yeah, but why can't the hose do that?
[15:09.290 --> 15:09.590]  Inside?
[15:10.910 --> 15:12.990]  Oh, I mean that's an outdoor can though.
[15:13.150 --> 15:16.170]  An indoor watering can is much smaller and less muddy than that.
[15:16.530 --> 15:18.910]  Yeah, but the hose doesn't travel across the entire yard,
[15:18.970 --> 15:22.430]  so like if I want to water the rose bushes over on Millie's side of the house,
[15:22.510 --> 15:26.930]  I use a watering can. Or sometimes I'll fill up the watering can outside with the hose,
[15:27.090 --> 15:29.530]  because it's way faster than using the kitchen sink,
[15:29.630 --> 15:32.390]  and then I can go around and water the plants inside the house with it.
[15:32.610 --> 15:33.890]  All right, yeah, fair enough.
[15:33.910 --> 15:37.570]  But you don't want to have a giant-ass black watering can hanging out in your living room,
[15:37.590 --> 15:38.210]  so you put it outside.
[15:39.130 --> 15:41.490]  I still, I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that
[15:41.490 --> 15:45.110]  a watering can threw a combo at Geoff, and he didn't feel it was contact.
[15:46.310 --> 15:47.210]  It just didn't.
[15:47.370 --> 15:47.890]  Yeah, you used three blows.
[15:48.010 --> 15:50.370]  Maybe it knocked that part of my brain away, I don't know.
[15:52.010 --> 15:55.550]  Here's the deal, Andrew, and I think Gavin can corroborate this.
[15:56.230 --> 16:01.470]  That kind of shit happens so often throughout the course of every day of my life,
[16:01.550 --> 16:03.710]  that it just, it's second nature to me.
[16:03.870 --> 16:06.850]  I don't think about it, unless I have a Gavin behind me laughing at me
[16:06.850 --> 16:08.850]  and pointing out how ridiculous the situation is.
[16:09.010 --> 16:11.210]  Because that's like every 18 minutes of my life.
[16:11.610 --> 16:16.170]  It's true, it's like there's a non-magnetic magnet in your head
[16:16.170 --> 16:17.870]  that just pulls stuff towards it.
[16:18.030 --> 16:21.130]  Like, you whack your head on stuff like no one else,
[16:21.310 --> 16:22.990]  and not on metal things all the time.
[16:22.990 --> 16:23.210]  Yeah.
[16:23.530 --> 16:26.690]  It's just something about your skull that the universe likes.
[16:28.230 --> 16:30.450]  What was your last injury, Andrew?
[16:30.690 --> 16:32.710]  Have you bashed your head on anything recently?
[16:32.830 --> 16:35.650]  No, have I bashed, no, not a lot of head bashings.
[16:35.650 --> 16:40.150]  I broke my toe a while ago, when we were, like a year ago, I guess.
[16:40.210 --> 16:41.070]  That was probably the last one.
[16:41.410 --> 16:42.230]  Broke one of my toes.
[16:42.790 --> 16:44.410]  Just opened the door into it, bent back.
[16:44.750 --> 16:45.410]  How's that toe doing?
[16:45.730 --> 16:46.790]  It's fine, yeah.
[16:47.310 --> 16:48.350]  100%, back to...
[16:48.350 --> 16:49.550]  Yeah, I'd say 100%, yeah.
[16:49.670 --> 16:51.110]  I'd say it's a standard toe.
[16:51.290 --> 16:51.890]  Ankles are good?
[16:52.610 --> 16:54.670]  Ankles are unquestionable at times.
[16:54.770 --> 16:57.090]  I did, oh, should I talk about this?
[16:58.510 --> 17:00.430]  We don't know until you talk about it.
[17:00.550 --> 17:01.730]  Gavin knows what it is.
[17:01.830 --> 17:03.190]  Should I talk about this, Gavin?
[17:03.370 --> 17:05.170]  I texted Gavin about this before.
[17:05.170 --> 17:09.250]  One of the grossest things of my life happened to me.
[17:09.350 --> 17:11.030]  I don't remember what we're talking about.
[17:12.770 --> 17:14.090]  I hurt my Achilles.
[17:14.210 --> 17:15.410]  I guess I'm just gonna tell the story.
[17:15.530 --> 17:18.530]  This is the grossest thing that has ever happened to me.
[17:18.870 --> 17:19.630]  It is disgusting.
[17:20.230 --> 17:20.810]  It's unfortunate.
[17:21.710 --> 17:26.970]  I hurt my Achilles, and the day I hurt it was bad, but then it kept getting worse.
[17:27.190 --> 17:28.930]  But the day I hurt it, I had to go do something.
[17:29.630 --> 17:31.670]  So I brushed my teeth at my desk.
[17:32.050 --> 17:33.350]  I got my bathroom next to me.
[17:34.310 --> 17:35.930]  And then I went about my day.
[17:36.330 --> 17:38.890]  And then I hurt my, like, my Achilles was really bad.
[17:38.990 --> 17:39.530]  I had to lay down.
[17:39.630 --> 17:43.190]  So I was just kind of in bed for most of the time for, like, the next three days.
[17:43.330 --> 17:44.330]  So I'm having, like, a Tuesday.
[17:45.010 --> 17:47.330]  Finally kind of feeling like I'm mobile on Friday.
[17:48.070 --> 17:48.930]  Things are good.
[17:49.570 --> 17:53.910]  This was during while I was building my sauce empire, which is an important detail of the story.
[17:53.990 --> 17:54.810]  So I get more sauce.
[17:54.870 --> 17:55.470]  I get my meal.
[17:55.810 --> 17:56.630]  Get the nuggets.
[17:56.830 --> 17:57.550]  Get my drink.
[17:58.110 --> 17:59.650]  I take a big sip of my drink.
[17:59.910 --> 18:02.890]  And I drank my toothpaste from Tuesday.
[18:03.350 --> 18:03.830]  On Friday.
[18:05.570 --> 18:06.270]  Oh, yeah.
[18:06.570 --> 18:09.630]  I spit because I was at my desk when I brushed my teeth.
[18:09.690 --> 18:12.690]  So I just spit it into a McDonald's cup I had on my desk.
[18:12.910 --> 18:15.010]  And then I spent the next three days.
[18:15.710 --> 18:17.850]  I spent the next three days immobilized.
[18:18.710 --> 18:20.530]  So I didn't clean my desk at all.
[18:20.790 --> 18:25.890]  And it was in the same cup as is the same looking cup is the new one I got with the nuggets.
[18:26.430 --> 18:27.690]  And I mistook them.
[18:28.110 --> 18:29.950]  And I just was like, oh, there's a little bit left.
[18:30.110 --> 18:30.650]  Final sip.
[18:30.650 --> 18:35.550]  And it was the spit that was that it was it was bad.
[18:35.630 --> 18:38.210]  It was it was disgusting.
[18:38.970 --> 18:40.850]  Where was the toothbrush during all this?
[18:41.190 --> 18:42.850]  I guess the toothbrush would have been on my desk.
[18:43.370 --> 18:47.690]  So you you're the kind of person that when you stop doing something,
[18:47.790 --> 18:48.950]  you just put it down right there.
[18:48.990 --> 18:50.630]  And that's where it lives until forever.
[18:51.030 --> 18:53.770]  You didn't take the toothbrush back to the bathroom.
[18:54.350 --> 18:55.230]  No, I was list.
[18:55.350 --> 18:57.650]  I my my I was in.
[18:57.970 --> 18:58.750]  It's tough to walk.
[18:58.750 --> 19:00.990]  So I sat down, put on my desk.
[19:01.130 --> 19:03.670]  Typically, I'd always like I don't brush my teeth at my desk.
[19:03.730 --> 19:06.650]  General typically would do that in the bathroom in front of the sink.
[19:06.990 --> 19:08.870]  I feel like brushing teeth without running water, though.
[19:08.930 --> 19:12.350]  That's like what was what was the state of your mouth after you
[19:12.350 --> 19:13.670]  gauzed it into a cup?
[19:13.790 --> 19:15.990]  Surely you've still got like you need to rinse.
[19:16.190 --> 19:17.490]  No, no, that was not a good one.
[19:17.530 --> 19:18.150]  I always rinse.
[19:18.250 --> 19:18.910]  That was a no rinse.
[19:18.990 --> 19:20.130]  I'm saying it was a bad moment.
[19:20.550 --> 19:21.570]  I'm not proud of this.
[19:21.650 --> 19:23.130]  This is an unfortunate moment.
[19:23.470 --> 19:24.530]  What did it taste like?
[19:24.590 --> 19:26.110]  Because surely it just tasted like mint.
[19:26.850 --> 19:29.750]  Well, so there was a little bit of root beer still in that cup.
[19:29.750 --> 19:30.830]  So imagine like.
[19:32.290 --> 19:33.630]  Oh, it gets grosser.
[19:35.410 --> 19:37.890]  There is like a little bit of root beer when I spit into it.
[19:37.990 --> 19:42.410]  So it tasted like old root beer and then immediately that mintiness of toothpaste.
[19:44.150 --> 19:47.910]  And but I took like a hard sip because it was just a little bit less.
[19:48.030 --> 19:50.450]  I was like, I need to just, you know, like really suck on this one.
[19:50.510 --> 19:53.450]  And then I swallowed it by the before I even taste anything.
[19:53.830 --> 19:54.710]  Then I had the taste.
[19:55.390 --> 19:56.390]  I swallowed it.
[19:56.510 --> 19:57.330]  It was disgusting.
[19:57.530 --> 19:59.570]  It's the most disgusting thing.
[19:59.930 --> 20:00.890]  Well, I didn't taste anything.
[20:01.350 --> 20:02.390]  The consistency must have been all wrong.
[20:02.750 --> 20:04.170]  It was instant, Gavin.
[20:04.390 --> 20:05.370]  Like it was a huge.
[20:05.450 --> 20:07.950]  It was just like there was no it didn't.
[20:08.130 --> 20:09.630]  It spent no time in my mouth.
[20:09.750 --> 20:11.970]  It was like looping a track down your gullet.
[20:12.110 --> 20:15.310]  Yeah, it just it was because it was the same exact fucking cup.
[20:15.330 --> 20:16.910]  And I just put them in the wrong places.
[20:17.430 --> 20:18.510]  It was tragic.
[20:18.910 --> 20:19.630]  It was disgusting.
[20:19.790 --> 20:23.830]  Just imagining you a white wine tasting like, oh, how was the mouth feel?
[20:23.830 --> 20:24.670]  And you're like the what?
[20:27.430 --> 20:30.730]  I think the grossest thing that's ever happened to me, I felt sick.
[20:30.830 --> 20:33.670]  I felt like I had contracted a virus as soon as it happened.
[20:33.770 --> 20:34.610]  I didn't know what to do.
[20:34.650 --> 20:35.150]  It was like that.
[20:35.210 --> 20:36.010]  Just I can't reverse.
[20:36.190 --> 20:37.150]  I think I would have thrown up.
[20:37.190 --> 20:40.110]  Did you did you have any little any pushback from the.
[20:40.390 --> 20:45.130]  I think my soul left my body like I was no longer a person after it happened.
[20:45.130 --> 20:47.470]  And I processed what I had just been through.
[20:47.590 --> 20:48.930]  You had an out of body experience.
[20:49.190 --> 20:49.290]  I did.
[20:49.550 --> 20:50.030]  Floated out.
[20:50.110 --> 20:52.690]  You look back down at yourself and just thought, I'm disgusting.
[20:52.690 --> 20:57.690]  It was just yeah, it was like it was an unintentional gross.
[20:58.090 --> 20:59.110]  It was just unfortunate.
[20:59.510 --> 21:00.530]  It's an unfortunate accident.
[21:00.950 --> 21:02.130]  If it helps, buddy, I've been there.
[21:02.450 --> 21:06.350]  It's disgusting and terrible and it'll haunt you for years.
[21:06.470 --> 21:07.350]  But you will get.
[21:07.490 --> 21:08.750]  Oh, I'm never getting over this.
[21:09.030 --> 21:10.830]  It's I haven't had root beer since.
[21:11.250 --> 21:12.250]  I will never have root beer.
[21:12.570 --> 21:13.830]  It could kill a root beer for you.
[21:13.930 --> 21:15.010]  I it killed.
[21:15.150 --> 21:15.950]  I did something similar.
[21:16.050 --> 21:19.630]  It killed Pepsi for me for a long, long time, where when I was in Kuwait,
[21:19.630 --> 21:23.710]  one of the times in the army, my boss used to dip all the time.
[21:23.830 --> 21:26.410]  And everybody's got a story about how they accidentally drank dip.
[21:26.650 --> 21:27.870]  But I fucking did as well.
[21:28.150 --> 21:30.110]  And he used to spit it into this Pepsi can.
[21:30.290 --> 21:34.330]  And I picked up a Pepsi can that was three quarters full because my Pepsi can was three
[21:34.330 --> 21:34.850]  quarters full.
[21:35.130 --> 21:36.810]  And it was in the desert in Kuwait.
[21:36.890 --> 21:40.050]  So I didn't expect it to be cold because there wasn't a lot of air conditioning.
[21:40.230 --> 21:41.070]  So it wasn't cold.
[21:41.170 --> 21:42.490]  So it didn't strike me as odd.
[21:42.630 --> 21:46.130]  And then I chugged the entire three quarter bottle.
[21:46.130 --> 21:49.090]  And then everything went wrong all at once.
[21:49.290 --> 21:53.210]  And I had like a moment of levity where I took the Pepsi can down and I looked at it.
[21:53.290 --> 21:55.670]  And I thought my brain figured out what it was.
[21:55.810 --> 21:57.210]  And I just kind of looked at it for a second.
[21:57.350 --> 21:58.870]  And then full realization came.
[21:59.050 --> 22:02.670]  And I just turned to the right and I projectile vomited across the office.
[22:04.210 --> 22:07.390]  People got to just stop drinking the dregs of stuff.
[22:07.470 --> 22:07.830]  Yeah.
[22:07.910 --> 22:09.430]  And what's with all the spit?
[22:09.530 --> 22:14.250]  Like, I won't spit anywhere unless it's going to slip down the pipe with water.
[22:14.250 --> 22:14.810]  Like what?
[22:15.430 --> 22:17.290]  Gozzing into a candle and into cups.
[22:17.650 --> 22:19.130]  That disgusts me alone.
[22:19.310 --> 22:21.010]  It's those tobacco chewers, man.
[22:21.070 --> 22:21.730]  That's what they do.
[22:22.850 --> 22:24.470]  The candle was an exception.
[22:24.670 --> 22:26.030]  I needed... there was nothing else.
[22:26.110 --> 22:27.410]  I didn't opt for the candle.
[22:27.550 --> 22:28.590]  That wasn't my place of choice.
[22:28.830 --> 22:30.190]  You were drinking out of a bottle though.
[22:30.650 --> 22:32.710]  Yeah, but the bottle still had liquid in it.
[22:32.830 --> 22:33.470]  I didn't...
[22:33.470 --> 22:34.130]  Just spit in that though.
[22:34.130 --> 22:35.150]  That's where the liquid came from.
[22:35.190 --> 22:35.850]  Why the candle?
[22:36.050 --> 22:38.070]  You do... I've been over this before, Gavin.
[22:38.150 --> 22:40.090]  I'm a fucking violent vomiter.
[22:40.290 --> 22:41.250]  It is aggressive.
[22:41.490 --> 22:43.430]  There's no way I'm getting that all in the bottle.
[22:43.430 --> 22:44.650]  It's shooting everywhere.
[22:44.790 --> 22:46.590]  I just needed something I could put my mouth over.
[22:46.730 --> 22:49.190]  You can't... you can't like spit through pursed lips.
[22:49.590 --> 22:52.590]  There's no... no, I was... everything was coming up at that time.
[22:52.670 --> 22:54.670]  I couldn't... I had to go into the candle.
[22:54.970 --> 22:56.790]  There's nothing else I had at my desk.
[22:57.870 --> 23:00.430]  I'd go into my hand before I went into a candle.
[23:00.590 --> 23:02.410]  A candle's way better than a hand.
[23:02.670 --> 23:06.310]  Is it the same candle that you burn the waffle air freshener in?
[23:06.390 --> 23:09.530]  It's a different... it's a different candle than the waffle.
[23:09.730 --> 23:10.990]  Does the candle still function?
[23:11.330 --> 23:15.010]  Oh no, that candle is... is the waffle one or the spit one?
[23:15.110 --> 23:16.430]  The spit one I'm sure is fine.
[23:16.510 --> 23:18.050]  I haven't used it, but I'm sure it's fine.
[23:18.170 --> 23:19.610]  But the waffle one is...
[23:19.610 --> 23:21.170]  Why do you have so many candles in your bedroom?
[23:21.270 --> 23:21.990]  I'm a candle guy.
[23:22.430 --> 23:23.470]  I like to keep the fire going.
[23:24.410 --> 23:25.810]  He did say that. He's a candle guy.
[23:26.030 --> 23:27.170]  I like to keep the fire going.
[23:28.950 --> 23:30.670]  I just feel like it's bad for a bedroom.
[23:30.830 --> 23:32.810]  Unless you're trying to do like a romantic gesture.
[23:33.250 --> 23:34.090]  Oh, it smells nice.
[23:34.530 --> 23:36.010]  I'm not allowed to have a nice smelling space.
[23:36.310 --> 23:37.910]  But maybe he's romancing the Casio.
[23:37.910 --> 23:38.890]  You never know.
[23:39.790 --> 23:43.010]  A bedroom is just way more flammable, I feel like, than a normal room.
[23:43.130 --> 23:44.650]  I got a fire extinguisher.
[23:46.570 --> 23:50.850]  He's got a trash bag full of extinguished fire extinguisher shit.
[23:52.510 --> 23:56.470]  I like the idea of him keeping his fire suppressants in a black bin bag.
[23:56.690 --> 23:58.470]  Just sprinkle some of the bag on whatever.
[23:58.770 --> 24:01.170]  Just opens the bag and kicks it all over the room.
[24:03.570 --> 24:06.970]  I don't have a fire extinguisher, but I have the ingredients of a fire extinguisher.
[24:07.490 --> 24:12.690]  That would be interesting to see if just the powder in a bag would actually do the job.
[24:13.570 --> 24:15.270]  Could we put out a fire with it?
[24:15.610 --> 24:17.770]  What a weird...
[24:17.770 --> 24:22.150]  Yeah, something's on fire, shoot it on a bag and then pat out the fire with the bag.
[24:22.770 --> 24:24.170]  An unnecessary step.
[24:24.990 --> 24:29.850]  Hey, by the way, what was it like to burn that waffle air freshener?
[24:30.010 --> 24:30.890]  So that's the thing.
[24:31.010 --> 24:34.830]  So as talked about before, I have a smoke alarm right above my desk,
[24:34.830 --> 24:37.070]  which went off when I tried to cook desk dogs.
[24:37.210 --> 24:39.910]  I was very worried about the logistics of the thing.
[24:40.210 --> 24:44.290]  That's why I left, because I lit it and it just went up in smoke immediately.
[24:44.630 --> 24:49.710]  I then sprinted to the patio and it went out briefly because it fell into the wax
[24:49.710 --> 24:50.970]  and I had to relight it.
[24:51.210 --> 24:53.310]  There's a whole process. It smelled terrible.
[24:53.630 --> 24:54.130]  It was not good.
[24:54.470 --> 24:56.570]  It wasn't as bad as the freshener itself.
[24:56.730 --> 25:00.930]  Maybe the worst smell I've ever encountered, but it was a bad smell.
[25:00.930 --> 25:05.390]  We had a funny moment where at this point, it was like six months ago.
[25:05.430 --> 25:06.790]  We did that second break show.
[25:06.970 --> 25:09.330]  I don't even know where we are in the timeline right now.
[25:09.850 --> 25:14.110]  But in it, we had some fun fucking around with the air freshener and like sticking it
[25:14.110 --> 25:16.570]  under each other's chairs and stuff because it is intense.
[25:17.110 --> 25:21.030]  And then I thought, like, this is kind of a funny way to promote this thing.
[25:21.090 --> 25:23.690]  And, you know, maybe people buy it and it's silly and dumb and maybe they can,
[25:23.770 --> 25:27.850]  you know, like grumpy old minute to their friends, like I suggested or whatever.
[25:28.030 --> 25:29.750]  And then after it was over, Eric came to me.
[25:29.750 --> 25:33.270]  Yeah, Tony, Tony just texted me and was like, hey, man, really appreciate all the
[25:33.270 --> 25:36.010]  all the promotion on the on the waffle freshener.
[25:36.050 --> 25:37.650]  But it's it's been out of stock for a while.
[25:37.710 --> 25:39.310]  Should we reorder it or are you?
[25:41.850 --> 25:42.690]  Yes, please.
[25:43.270 --> 25:44.330]  I didn't realize.
[25:45.530 --> 25:47.990]  That's the most f*** face thing I could think of doing,
[25:48.290 --> 25:51.630]  is spending extra time promoting a product that's unbuyable.
[25:52.970 --> 25:54.430]  That everyone hates anyway.
[25:54.530 --> 25:55.630]  Yeah, that everybody hates.
[25:57.150 --> 25:59.950]  I enjoyed f*** face break shit part two.
[26:00.150 --> 26:02.050]  I liked it. Yeah, it's a lot better than the first one.
[26:02.330 --> 26:07.630]  It was the most nervous I've been to do anything related to the show, I would say, by far.
[26:07.850 --> 26:08.610]  For the second one?
[26:08.790 --> 26:09.870]  For the second one. Yeah.
[26:10.030 --> 26:10.790]  Why? Why is that?
[26:11.210 --> 26:15.550]  Because I the first one, I just I didn't I don't know.
[26:15.690 --> 26:19.310]  I mean, you're an immediate disadvantage by not being there,
[26:19.330 --> 26:23.190]  because it's like so much like 90 percent of that is just shit happening on the table.
[26:23.190 --> 26:27.490]  Yeah, you're limited in what you can contribute. I understand.
[26:27.890 --> 26:31.790]  So it's it's yeah, so it's like a layer of just not liking my performance of it.
[26:31.850 --> 26:34.830]  And then I like had a massive anxiety attack during the first one.
[26:35.210 --> 26:39.810]  And it was just so was stressful doing the second one.
[26:40.050 --> 26:42.070]  But it was a lot of fun. Maybe we shouldn't do it.
[26:42.210 --> 26:44.110]  No, I love. No, I love the second.
[26:44.190 --> 26:45.930]  The first one was like the most draining thing.
[26:46.010 --> 26:47.210]  I just hated my performance.
[26:47.850 --> 26:49.570]  And you guys were great in it.
[26:49.850 --> 26:51.930]  But I don't know. It's just it was a weird thing.
[26:51.930 --> 26:56.890]  Well, well, I understand. I understand that spiral of self-hate and doubt.
[26:57.150 --> 27:01.710]  I feel it. That's why I stopped listening to the podcast again after I started listening to it,
[27:01.770 --> 27:03.370]  because I can't fucking stand me. Yeah.
[27:03.450 --> 27:06.710]  And every and every episode that I would listen to where I would talk, I would say,
[27:06.770 --> 27:08.270]  well, that's the worst episode we've ever done.
[27:08.490 --> 27:11.490]  But I'll say from my end, Andrew, both episodes.
[27:11.730 --> 27:14.250]  I thought you were great. Didn't didn't show at all.
[27:14.250 --> 27:15.890]  Had no idea you were going through some shit.
[27:15.950 --> 27:18.550]  And it didn't it didn't wasn't reflected in your performance.
[27:18.730 --> 27:20.950]  I agree. I'm thinking maybe we should wear headphones then
[27:20.950 --> 27:24.850]  so we can hear Andrew in our ears instead of on a little telly behind Eric's head.
[27:25.390 --> 27:29.070]  Yeah, it's it's like the timing of it is a little different than doing a thing.
[27:29.270 --> 27:31.170]  I don't know. It was just it was it was stressful.
[27:31.390 --> 27:35.870]  I felt like I let you down and I didn't want to do it like it wasn't you guys were great.
[27:35.970 --> 27:37.490]  I didn't think the stream was bad.
[27:37.790 --> 27:41.150]  It was more of a place of like, oh, I don't want to let you guys down in some way,
[27:41.610 --> 27:43.750]  especially something that you're so passionate about, Geoff.
[27:44.110 --> 27:46.870]  So I was scared going into the second one.
[27:46.950 --> 27:47.810]  Oh, you didn't let us down at all.
[27:47.810 --> 27:51.970]  I feel like it's it's it's hard for you in that situation because you're not in the room,
[27:52.030 --> 27:56.430]  but also because like if if time goes by where you haven't said anything for a while because we
[27:56.430 --> 28:00.450]  like focus on the table or the cards and stuff, it makes it puts pressure on whenever you chime
[28:00.450 --> 28:04.590]  in again for it to be something bigger than it is, if you know what I mean.
[28:04.690 --> 28:08.350]  Yeah, it's a weird timing thing where sometimes like the room flow is so good.
[28:08.470 --> 28:12.750]  I don't want to be like you guys are doing like you're riffing and I come in with a fucking cowbell
[28:12.750 --> 28:17.730]  and it just is completely out of like, that's sort of my you guys were great.
[28:17.830 --> 28:20.410]  So it was stressful, but I had a lot of fun. I wanted to also just credit
[28:20.410 --> 28:25.170]  somebody in the community. Giuliaria made my Eric Baudour thing. I meant to talk about that,
[28:25.210 --> 28:30.570]  but I just I collapsed after we did the first brick shit like it was I was drained. I felt
[28:30.570 --> 28:36.730]  terrible. Yeah, that makes two of us. Anxiety filled. They're on YouTube if you've not seen
[28:36.730 --> 28:41.610]  them. Yeah, but either on the Achievement Hunter YouTube channel, although it may be on the
[28:41.610 --> 28:46.190]  Face YouTube channel at this point. If that's a thing, Eric, please. Well, yeah, Eric says
[28:46.190 --> 28:51.130]  they're both on the Face YouTube channel. So they're OK. Well, it's good to know that we've
[28:51.130 --> 28:56.390]  never talked about, but I think exists. Yes, it does. It came out, I think, today, yesterday.
[28:56.910 --> 29:01.070]  We have a YouTube channel, but it's just the episodes. Right. And then the break shows.
[29:01.070 --> 29:05.510]  And we've got some ideas for things here and there as well. OK, I'm trying to go into my
[29:05.510 --> 29:09.830]  images. So I lit the candle on fire. You guys ended the second break shit stream
[29:09.830 --> 29:14.250]  and I came back to a terrifying image. It was a close up shot of the Zimmer Bear
[29:14.250 --> 29:18.770]  just on its side. Like I had no context. Now we got there. I didn't know what I was looking at,
[29:18.830 --> 29:23.430]  but it was just my full screen was just Zimmer Bear sideways, which is a terrifying image.
[29:23.870 --> 29:26.650]  I watched for like 30 seconds. I think you were just boxing shit,
[29:27.310 --> 29:32.390]  Geoff, at the end of the show. Oh, yeah. But it was just like the most disturbing thing to come
[29:32.390 --> 29:38.990]  back to. I burnt this. It was like Don Zimmer was mad at me for lighting the waffle thing on fire.
[29:38.990 --> 29:44.710]  Dude, you you sent me an article. I think I don't know if it was this episode or last episode we
[29:44.710 --> 29:48.410]  were talking about Zimmer and you were talking about learning about his life and some of the,
[29:48.830 --> 29:51.910]  you know, about him being in the coma and stuff. And I think you got a lot of that from that
[29:51.910 --> 29:58.590]  article about his wife and how she scrapbooked his entire career. And she seems like a phenomenally
[29:58.590 --> 30:03.810]  funny and interesting, charismatic lady. But the craziest thing about that was was you sent me the
[30:03.810 --> 30:09.730]  and it's just a picture of her in her like office with all of her Zimmer memorabilia and right
[30:09.730 --> 30:17.390]  smack dab in the middle of it. You cannot miss it is the fucking Zimmer face that we have behind
[30:17.390 --> 30:22.810]  me in the face. And I could I laugh for like two straight minutes. It's so hard. Once you see it,
[30:22.870 --> 30:27.410]  it's all you can see. And it's so fucking funny. It made me want to read his books more because
[30:27.410 --> 30:32.070]  and maybe there just is nothing outside of baseball. But it's so tough to find information
[30:32.070 --> 30:36.330]  relating to Don Zimmer that isn't somehow wrapped in baseball. He got married on a
[30:36.330 --> 30:42.190]  baseball field like it's his whole life is baseball. Yeah, 100 percent. Just a fascinating.
[30:42.490 --> 30:45.750]  I was, you know, I was trying to do research. I was trying to figure out what foods he liked.
[30:45.810 --> 30:49.630]  It was tough. And I stumbled on this like random excerpt from a book that is like
[30:49.630 --> 30:55.010]  baseball superstitions. I read the story of it was like in the 30s for a baseball team.
[30:55.330 --> 31:00.290]  And this team went on a winning streak and the coach demanded that all the players eat what
[31:00.290 --> 31:05.250]  they ate on the first day of the winning streak. And this one guy down like a whole glass of prune
[31:05.250 --> 31:09.770]  juice that day. And so for every day he had to drink prune juice like a full glass of it.
[31:09.890 --> 31:14.050]  They went on an eight game winning streak. So it's like eight days in a row. Or I guess. Yeah,
[31:14.090 --> 31:17.750]  I guess they're back to back games. He had eight days of prune juice. He was just miserable.
[31:18.010 --> 31:22.290]  It's like the most excited he's ever been to loose like he faced himself as just he happened
[31:22.290 --> 31:26.010]  to have prune juice on the day of a winning streak. It was like some random coaches like
[31:26.010 --> 31:29.690]  keep doing what you're doing every day and fucking prune juice every day.
[31:30.930 --> 31:35.430]  Be terrible. Never had that. No, I've never. There's no reason. We you know, we should do.
[31:35.910 --> 31:41.390]  We should all before we record the next episode of Face, we should all get prune juice and then
[31:41.390 --> 31:47.450]  we should drink it. And then see if it makes see if we have a streak, see if we have a good episode.
[31:47.730 --> 31:54.830]  What is a prune plumb? Is it? Yeah, I think that's right. Dead plum. I think it's a dead plum. Yeah,
[31:54.830 --> 32:00.390]  I have no idea what a prune is, but what is a regulation amount of prune juice? We need to.
[32:00.950 --> 32:08.070]  What are we doing for size? It's a raisin plum. Yeah, that makes sense. A raisin. Oh, wait, wait.
[32:08.230 --> 32:15.650]  Not like a grape. Could I? I'm not sure what is confusing about like Gavin said it. And then
[32:15.650 --> 32:22.410]  what's the confusion? A raisin is it is a grape that is dehydrated. Yeah, it's like it's like the
[32:22.890 --> 32:28.890]  yeah, it's like the raisin equivalent of a plum. So raisin is just a term for dehydration in fruit.
[32:29.370 --> 32:33.410]  OK, that's yeah, I didn't know that. I assumed raisin was its own thing. I didn't know it was
[32:33.410 --> 32:38.170]  a general term that could cover other categories. Well, at least at least in the Achievement Hunter
[32:38.170 --> 32:42.830]  world, that's the case. I don't know. In the larger world is Humpty Dumpty an Easter thing?
[32:46.670 --> 32:54.030]  No, because what we did. Speaking of. OK, well, there's a there's a reason for this.
[32:54.490 --> 32:58.610]  When we did the break shit to stream. Speaking of things are like moments that pass where you
[32:58.610 --> 33:02.830]  can't comment. Somebody mailed a bunch of packs very kindly to you and you're going through the
[33:02.830 --> 33:08.410]  packs. And one of them was like Easter themed. And it looked like a giant egg, which I assume
[33:08.410 --> 33:11.690]  was Humpty Dumpty. And I never really thought about the fact that Humpty Dumpty was an egg,
[33:11.690 --> 33:15.450]  which then made me think is Humpty Dumpty an Easter thing? I don't really know the origin
[33:15.450 --> 33:19.690]  of Humpty Dumpty. So I just thought I'd ask. I don't think he lived long enough to find out.
[33:19.930 --> 33:24.230]  I just it's I just wanted to ask is this it came to my mind. We're talking about this.
[33:24.350 --> 33:27.890]  I don't know how I got there, but I was just curious. I didn't think he was.
[33:28.230 --> 33:31.610]  I never I've never associated Humpty Dumpty with Easter.
[33:31.930 --> 33:35.870]  It's part of the Easter pack, though. Well, I just I never thought about the fact he was
[33:35.870 --> 33:39.890]  because who would try to put an egg back together when you break an egg? There's no.
[33:39.890 --> 33:43.670]  Well, especially when you're using horses. Of course, a horse can put an egg back together.
[33:43.910 --> 33:47.830]  Oh, yeah. That's really weird that the horses were involved. I don't know what part the horses
[33:47.830 --> 33:51.870]  were in on. I always assume they rode in. But you're right. The wording.
[33:52.350 --> 33:56.110]  Do you think that when they said all the king's horses and all the king's men,
[33:56.190 --> 34:01.730]  they're talking about the king of kings, God. And this is a whole metaphor where like
[34:01.730 --> 34:04.690]  not even God could put Humpty Dumpty back together. He's so broken.
[34:05.110 --> 34:07.570]  I think that's a bit slightly deeper than what they were going for.
[34:07.570 --> 34:10.850]  Yeah. No, I never even considered who the king would be.
[34:11.190 --> 34:15.590]  That makes it religious because Easter is a religious holiday. Maybe that's the angle into
[34:15.590 --> 34:16.670]  Easter. Ah.
[34:16.930 --> 34:21.250]  So was he always an egg or was he a man that died and then became an egg to make it more
[34:21.250 --> 34:25.310]  nursery rhyme friendly? Humpty Dumpty. Was that a nickname?
[34:26.030 --> 34:31.790]  What is the story behind? What is the origin? This is Vin Diesel 2.0.
[34:33.350 --> 34:37.090]  Quietly googling Humpty Dumpty. How old was Humpty Dumpty during
[34:37.090 --> 34:39.530]  the first Fast and Furious? Yeah, we're in the Fast and the Furious
[34:39.530 --> 34:42.730]  portion of the... Humpty Dumpty doesn't give away the fact
[34:42.730 --> 34:45.510]  that he's an egg. It's not like eggy waggy on the wall.
[34:45.670 --> 34:47.870]  No. It's Humpty Dumpty. It's like a great name
[34:47.870 --> 34:51.510]  for a camel. There's a pissed off camel somewhere. He can't use that name.
[34:52.170 --> 34:59.830]  Through the Looking Glass has the Humpty Dumpty stuff in it. And in chapter six,
[34:59.830 --> 35:03.750]  Humpty Dumpty is apparently... He becomes more...
[35:03.750 --> 35:08.630]  The egg only got larger and larger and more and more human.
[35:09.710 --> 35:12.990]  What? So wait, an egg started inflating.
[35:13.450 --> 35:17.510]  Oh no, that's terrifying. So you're saying that I could have got
[35:17.510 --> 35:22.570]  Humpty Dumpty in a carton was his origin. Like he started standard regulation egg size.
[35:22.770 --> 35:24.830]  And then became... He's just part of a dozen eggs.
[35:24.930 --> 35:27.230]  Yeah, he's just part of a pack. And then he grew.
[35:27.230 --> 35:29.910]  It predates the Lewis Carroll story.
[35:30.470 --> 35:34.050]  Okay, sorry. I didn't want to... We didn't have to veer off completely
[35:34.050 --> 35:36.510]  in Humpty Dumpty. I was just curious. It just popped into my head.
[35:36.910 --> 35:42.410]  Oh, it says, as with a lot of these iconic old tales, though, things aren't as they seem here.
[35:42.550 --> 35:48.270]  Not at all. Incredibly, the original Humpty Dumpty wasn't an egg. He was probably a cannon.
[35:48.730 --> 35:51.530]  A cannon? Yeah, the original story predates Carroll's
[35:51.530 --> 35:55.210]  take on the character. According to a number of military historians, Humpty Dumpty was the
[35:55.210 --> 35:59.890]  name of a cannon used by the Royalists during the English Civil War. The conflict ranged from
[35:59.890 --> 36:06.930]  1642 to 1649. And in June of 1648, Humpty Dumpty was stationed on the walls of Colchester. It was
[36:06.930 --> 36:10.530]  one of several cannons erected to try and keep Parliament's army from taking the city. Dude,
[36:10.950 --> 36:14.630]  Humpty Dumpty saved your country, Gavin. I just like the idea of someone knocking
[36:14.630 --> 36:18.650]  over a cannon and it rolls off a wall. And that became a pivotal moment in human history
[36:18.650 --> 36:24.890]  for decades and centuries to come. The cannon is named Humpty Dumpty?
[36:25.370 --> 36:29.330]  Yeah, yeah. Let's see. Was it on like a little raised portion of the ground?
[36:29.430 --> 36:34.030]  Someone got killed by Humpty Dumpty. The next month, however, the Parliamentary
[36:34.030 --> 36:37.750]  forces heavily damaged the walls beneath Humpty Dumpty with their own artillery.
[36:38.170 --> 36:41.610]  You can guess where this is going. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, broke into pieces.
[36:41.910 --> 36:44.750]  As for that business of all the king's horses and all the king's men,
[36:45.050 --> 36:49.450]  it seems like those lines can be taken quite literally. The Royalists, or Cavaliers,
[36:49.750 --> 36:53.950]  were very much the king's men fighting in support of King Charles, who would go on to lose the war,
[36:54.730 --> 36:59.010]  yadda, yadda, yadda. So, interesting. So, that's a good point. How many people did
[36:59.010 --> 37:01.550]  Humpty Dumpty kill? He was probably a mass murderer.
[37:02.210 --> 37:03.950]  I'd assume so. Yeah.
[37:04.430 --> 37:08.590]  Can you imagine sending horses in to fix a cannon? That's more unreasonable to me than
[37:08.590 --> 37:11.850]  fixing an egg with horses. I would never send horses for a cannon.
[37:12.170 --> 37:16.030]  Well, no, it's more unreasonable to fix an egg because a horse could do a lot more damage to
[37:16.030 --> 37:19.230]  a broken egg than a broken cannon. Yeah, but I feel like...
[37:19.230 --> 37:21.910]  A horse is just going to make it work. No, I feel like a horse, you just kind of
[37:21.910 --> 37:25.930]  got to line the egg up, right? Like, if you're fixing a cannon, that's a mechanical level,
[37:26.030 --> 37:28.170]  you're going to need tools. A horse can't hold a screwdriver.
[37:29.310 --> 37:32.330]  Right, yeah, a horse can't hold a wrench and a screwdriver, that's why.
[37:32.470 --> 37:36.610]  Yeah, that's... well, I guess maybe in its mouth it could. There's probably ways that this could
[37:36.610 --> 37:38.690]  work, but... That's the problem with... it's the great...
[37:38.690 --> 37:43.710]  the great failure of a horse is that it doesn't have opposable hooves. That's what's... it's
[37:43.710 --> 37:46.490]  what holds it back. It does. I'd agree with that.
[37:51.470 --> 37:57.390]  We all have passions that push us to do big things in life. Like, for instance, being so
[37:57.390 --> 38:02.330]  obsessed with video games that you play them constantly, and then you and your best friends
[38:02.330 --> 38:09.550]  all start a media company, and then 18 years later you do this ad. Passion comes from a deep burning
[38:09.550 --> 38:15.530]  love of logistics and management. No, it doesn't. It comes from a desire to create. And then to
[38:15.530 --> 38:20.430]  share that creation with other people, that's where logistics and order management come in.
[38:20.690 --> 38:25.310]  No one's passionate about that, except for the folks at ShipStation. They make it easy to manage
[38:25.310 --> 38:29.350]  your orders and get your products out the door, so you can get back to doing what you really love,

[40:07.250 --> 40:12.850]  then maybe one more vacation with my daughter. And you can guarantee when I travel, I will be

[41:35.050 --> 41:40.710]  Speaking of break shit and cards, I have a thing I want to share with you guys that I've been
[41:40.710 --> 41:45.310]  sitting on a while. I talked to Geoff briefly about this. I don't... it was quite the... I
[41:45.310 --> 41:51.190]  stumbled onto William Shatner's store. William Shatner has a store, and it is a strange thing.
[41:51.470 --> 41:56.190]  It has stuff on it that you'd assume. It's got things from his past. I'll just... I'll link...
[41:56.190 --> 42:00.490]  I'll put some links in. This is something I'm going to buy. I don't own a tie. I'm going to
[42:00.490 --> 42:05.330]  buy a tie from the William Shatner store. It's from Boston Legal. It was worn by somebody who
[42:05.330 --> 42:10.170]  was in one episode once. I'm very excited about this. Is that different to Boston Les? Or Boston
[42:10.170 --> 42:13.690]  Rob? They're all very different things. They're completely different things. Okay.
[42:13.730 --> 42:17.110]  But they're... the things you can get on his store... he's selling a Hall of Fame award
[42:17.110 --> 42:22.770]  on his store. If you just want to own his broadcasting Hall of Fame, one of a kind,
[42:22.770 --> 42:28.950]  you could do that. But maybe the most egregious thing... this is what made me want to explore
[42:28.950 --> 42:34.250]  the absurdity that is William Shatner's store. He's selling Star Wars merchandise. He just gives
[42:34.250 --> 42:38.730]  no fucks. I feel like that that'd be like a huge thing that he wouldn't do. I feel like there's a
[42:38.730 --> 42:43.710]  kind of line. Maybe it's changed over time. I'd love to see those links. I'm... they're all in
[42:43.710 --> 42:48.930]  the chat. Set of six danglers. I don't know what a dangler is. The other great part... I don't
[42:48.930 --> 42:56.210]  see them. No, they're not. All I see is Eric's shit. I don't... Which chat are you in? No,
[42:56.370 --> 43:01.150]  I'm in... I'm in my... oh, they're vanishing. My links are now vanishing. Suddenly,
[43:01.450 --> 43:05.790]  what is going on? What is happening to my links? Is Shatner issuing real-time takedowns?
[43:08.470 --> 43:13.630]  He does hate Gus. What? Why can't I put... there we go. There we go. There we go. Okay.
[43:14.830 --> 43:18.390]  Why does he hate Gus? It's Gus's story to tell. I think he told on the RT podcast,
[43:18.390 --> 43:21.990]  but he did a panel with him, and somebody asked him a question, or somebody asked a
[43:21.990 --> 43:25.010]  question about Shatner, and he didn't like the question, so he unfollowed, or he blocked
[43:25.010 --> 43:29.310]  everybody that was on the panel. So he blocked Gus on Twitter, even though Gus has nothing to
[43:29.310 --> 43:35.070]  do with him. That's a tie. He's selling Star Wars merch, but what makes it great... What the hell?
[43:35.330 --> 43:39.830]  He's just selling, like, weird stuff. He writes... he writes the bios for, like,
[43:39.870 --> 43:43.390]  all the products he sells. Like, when you read the Star Wars, one of my favorite things,
[43:43.390 --> 43:48.390]  you go into the description of it, these ships in the set appear to be from Star Wars Episode
[43:48.390 --> 43:52.110]  One, The Phantom Menace. Like, they don't even know. It appears to be. They're unsure.
[43:52.770 --> 43:59.330]  Andrew, you can buy at the William Shatner store a William Shatner Archives 1991 Hollywood Walk
[43:59.330 --> 44:05.890]  of Fame card. That's what I was getting to, as far as the cards go. Look at this amazing card. He
[44:05.890 --> 44:11.670]  has two different cards on his store. I'm going to post it here. Look at the grin he has. He looks
[44:11.670 --> 44:17.070]  happy. He looks like a man ready to sell you frozen goods. I could see that on the side of,
[44:17.170 --> 44:24.530]  like, a frozen, like, sausage box, maybe? A series of, like, breakfast heatable goodies,
[44:25.110 --> 44:30.750]  I would say. He's starting to look similar to Don Zimmer in his old age, in the way that the
[44:30.750 --> 44:36.130]  face... the features of the face, like, retreat back into the skull. How old is Shatner at this
[44:36.130 --> 44:43.270]  point? He's got to be pushing in the 90s. He's close to 90. He is 90. He turned 90 this year
[44:43.270 --> 44:48.830]  in March. He had great innings. The other card, the 1991 Hollywood Walk of Fame. I'm more of a
[44:48.830 --> 44:55.630]  fan of the 2017 Topps, Allen, and Ginter card. Oh, the Allen, Ginter, yeah. I like the 91 because
[44:55.630 --> 45:03.250]  the toupee is on point there. Let's look at it. I didn't notice. Do you think there's a toupee?
[45:04.030 --> 45:10.130]  For about 40 or 50 years now, he's had one, I think. Dude, that's a... I gotta buy that card.
[45:10.410 --> 45:15.150]  Or I gotta figure out if there's a pack that I can rip it from to get that. I mean, these all
[45:15.150 --> 45:22.790]  kind of make sense, right? Like, they're within the realm of... He's got TJ Hooker merch? Oh my
[45:22.790 --> 45:28.230]  God! He's got some TJ Hooker merch. This is where we get, like, this is the real gem of the William
[45:28.230 --> 45:33.230]  Shatner store. He just sells DVDs that aren't his, that he has nothing to do with. See, like,
[45:33.230 --> 45:38.250]  a distributor for other people's stuff? I don't know. Is he just selling his... Is it like his
[45:38.250 --> 45:44.690]  own eBay, where he's just grabbing crap from his own cabinets? It's everything that he has
[45:44.690 --> 45:53.510]  in his collection, apparently, like, when you read info about it. But $1,900 on a 2005 broadcast
[45:53.510 --> 46:02.730]  award. Oh my God. Who's that for? We've got to... It's unavailable. We've got to find this and watch
[46:02.730 --> 46:08.850]  it together. No, yeah, I was gonna get to that. Splat Attack is something I'm very excited about.
[46:08.950 --> 46:14.050]  The second one is on YouTube. Splat with two Ps. Does he have a paintball gun? He's playing,
[46:14.110 --> 46:21.050]  it's William Shatner playing paintball as a movie. And it's not a movie, it's his tale. It
[46:21.050 --> 46:27.990]  is like a documentary, like, it's not scripted. It is about how heroic he is. Sadly, this is the
[46:27.990 --> 46:34.290]  only way to get Splat Attack. The captain is back in an action, oh, in action, in the ultimate
[46:34.290 --> 46:43.390]  paintball showdown. Bursting with DVD extras. Splat Attack is simply unreal. A weird and
[46:43.390 --> 46:48.370]  delightful display of film crossing over somehow into the real world. Armed with paint, Shatner
[46:48.370 --> 46:55.690]  doesn't sit in some celebrity tent, surrounded by agents and studio producers. Instead, even though
[46:55.690 --> 47:02.330]  the man is in his 70s, he literally, in all caps, TAKES COMMAND and races out onto the field to
[47:02.330 --> 47:06.890]  lead troops to the battle. He's on the front lines, blasting away at the enemy, wiping out more
[47:06.890 --> 47:12.170]  experienced players with the bat of a hand. There were no special privileges for the Supreme Shatner,
[47:12.430 --> 47:18.470]  far from it. Instead, just like his alter ego Captain Kirk, Shatner charges in while others
[47:18.470 --> 47:23.530]  fear to tread, even when his men try to hold him back. Yet like Kirk, even against the possible
[47:23.530 --> 47:28.190]  odds, he somehow succeeds. Do you think he's fighting the alien that's in the top right of
[47:28.190 --> 47:31.210]  that image? Yeah, I was looking at it. It goes, on the left, it's just some humans wearing
[47:31.210 --> 47:36.070]  paintball gear, maybe some parachutes, then a big alien. Yeah, then a big old alien. There is a
[47:36.070 --> 47:40.890]  trailer for this, and yes, he is fighting that alien. He also comes in via parachute. He enters
[47:40.890 --> 47:47.690]  the paintball match via a parachute mechanism of some kind. Let me explain this Splat Attack
[47:47.690 --> 47:52.410]  trailer. I really want to watch this. I'm glad everyone else appears to be on board.
[47:52.810 --> 47:58.790]  We need to buy this movie. I feel like we should buy the award as well, and just have it as the
[47:58.790 --> 48:04.270]  F*** Face Podcast First Award, and it's William Shatner's 2005 Broadcast and Cable Award.
[48:04.590 --> 48:09.290]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. How much is that award going for? It's like $1,900.
[48:10.950 --> 48:15.210]  Eww! Eric, we're gonna need you to buy that for us. I feel like I wouldn't even want to buy,
[48:15.370 --> 48:19.270]  like, his Oscar for that. Like, why would you want someone else's award? It doesn't make any
[48:19.270 --> 48:24.750]  sense because someone has his name on it. For $1,900. It's a one-of-one, dude. It's one-of-one.
[48:24.830 --> 48:30.270]  Here's the trailer for Splat Attack. Please enjoy. It's very good. I'm very excited about this.
[48:30.490 --> 48:36.750]  Watching it. Do we need sound? Ah, it doesn't hurt. He returns to action.
[48:38.730 --> 48:40.170]  Shatner underscore log.
[48:42.990 --> 48:46.810]  He's flying in. Is this shot on a video camera?
[48:47.370 --> 48:52.150]  Four by three on video. What's going on? Is there a Star Trek outfit?
[48:54.810 --> 49:01.410]  From what I can tell, he maintained his superiority by only allowing people to
[49:01.410 --> 49:04.430]  play paintball with him that were invisibly worse-shaped than him.
[49:05.390 --> 49:10.230]  I can imagine working on this as, like, an extra and thinking, this is beneath me.
[49:15.110 --> 49:18.370]  Oh, man. That's fucking...
[49:18.370 --> 49:23.550]  Tanks, riot shields, a referee. It's got everything you could possibly want in a movie.
[49:23.830 --> 49:26.930]  You know what's amazing? That has been living on the internet for a while,
[49:27.270 --> 49:31.550]  just being awesome, and we had no idea until Andrew found it. Thank you, buddy.
[49:32.030 --> 49:37.830]  It was the weirdest thing to discover. It's just, like, also... Here's another thing. He has
[49:37.830 --> 49:42.990]  Coming Out Party for sale. He's the only place you can buy Hell on Wheels season one unwrapped,
[49:43.290 --> 49:47.430]  like, unopened. Like, he's just selling an AMC show for some reason.
[49:47.530 --> 49:51.830]  It looks like he shot this paintball movie but didn't get the rights to any of the paintball
[49:51.830 --> 49:58.590]  logos. Like, everything's blurred out everywhere. Oh, my God. Fandomstore.com. What is that?
[49:58.850 --> 50:02.930]  I have no idea. I did not explore. I think it might be the answer to...
[50:02.930 --> 50:05.230]  Oh, it doesn't exist. Never mind.
[50:05.230 --> 50:08.350]  Log on. Well, it's out of print, as they said. Yeah.
[50:08.670 --> 50:12.630]  But even, like... So, I just... I posted a link for Coming Out Party on DVD.
[50:13.270 --> 50:16.250]  It's a stand-up special. This is how it's described.
[50:16.730 --> 50:21.250]  One-of-a-kind stand-up comedy. It depicts seven gay guys hilariously explaining
[50:21.250 --> 50:25.750]  their personal and their friends' coming-out story. A great comical stand-up comedy based
[50:25.750 --> 50:31.130]  on real-life stories. Each comedian takes his hilarious time on stage. Like, what does that
[50:31.130 --> 50:36.450]  mean? Like, that is... I looked at the Amazon description. It is nothing like that. I love
[50:36.450 --> 50:41.050]  Shatner's editorials. They're just... They're terrible. So, Shatner's selling other people's
[50:41.050 --> 50:46.070]  products and, by the looks of it, guessing what they're about without actually watching them.
[50:46.070 --> 50:52.230]  Largely. Yes. Just assuming. Making assumptions about... You could buy... This is another...
[50:52.230 --> 50:56.970]  You love collectibles, Geoff. You're a big collectible guy. You can get an Emmy screener
[50:56.970 --> 51:03.450]  for Shatner's Rawner, which is the Kelsey Grammer episode, which ties back to this show. We've got
[51:03.450 --> 51:05.750]  some Kelsey Grammer stories of the past. It's true.
[51:06.070 --> 51:10.390]  It's a great... But, like, once again, a strange thing of... At the end of the product description,
[51:10.830 --> 51:14.550]  these are from Mr. Shatner's archives and are marked with archive stickers on the reverse.
[51:15.010 --> 51:19.430]  The episode on the DVD is the Kelsey Grammer. That's how they wrote it. We suggest you keep
[51:19.430 --> 51:25.110]  them sealed, as this show is never on DVD, and they will only appreciate in price given their
[51:25.110 --> 51:31.490]  rarity. So do not open it. Buy this disc from us, but do not open it, because Shatner's archive
[51:31.490 --> 51:35.810]  of Shatner's Rawner with Kelsey Grammer is going to skyrocket in value.
[51:36.190 --> 51:38.370]  Oh. That's fantastic.
[51:39.410 --> 51:44.090]  It's just a weird thing. I recommend exploring the store. I'm sure you'll find strange stuff there.
[51:44.410 --> 51:49.530]  It just seems like an endless well of bizarre. I emailed the store. I have yet to hear a reply
[51:49.530 --> 51:51.970]  back, but I hope I do. Be careful. There's no refunds,
[51:52.030 --> 51:54.230]  by the way, on the entire store. There are no refunds.
[51:54.730 --> 51:59.610]  Some of it is very aggressive. They have a category of things called items for a penny,
[51:59.770 --> 52:04.130]  and you cannot get more than two of them. You can get a Splat Attack poster, though,
[52:04.130 --> 52:07.130]  if you want, for one penny. Uh, yeah.
[52:07.750 --> 52:09.830]  That's eight by ten. We'll put that on the break show.
[52:10.090 --> 52:17.010]  That's set stuff right there. Also, Batman Forever enamel pinback earrings.
[52:17.370 --> 52:22.630]  A thing he had no involvement with. Once again, he has no ties to Batman Forever. He's not in it.
[52:22.630 --> 52:25.970]  I don't know why he has that. Maybe he was EP on some of these.
[52:26.210 --> 52:30.690]  Well, that's the thing. So, the question is, is that a Paramount movie? Because they have,
[52:30.770 --> 52:35.050]  when you go to the contact us page on his store, they have an address, and they say,
[52:35.170 --> 52:38.950]  don't visit this place, but this is the address. Don't come here. It's not public.
[52:39.310 --> 52:44.750]  And I looked it up. It's just Paramount Studios is his address. So, I feel like he just has a
[52:44.750 --> 52:49.990]  corner of some lot of Paramount, and it's just whatever they have in there he's selling.
[52:50.910 --> 52:54.370]  It's a weird thing. I bet you there are other strange celebrity stores,
[52:54.530 --> 52:57.290]  but I've never encountered anything quite like William Shatner's.
[52:57.470 --> 53:05.670]  Yeah, this one is pretty fantastic. It also, it's of a time, right? This looks like it was designed
[53:05.670 --> 53:07.430]  in 2003. Yes.
[53:07.750 --> 53:12.890]  And maybe it was, and it's still working, I guess, right? So, I wonder if he knows he has a store.
[53:13.110 --> 53:16.090]  I bet he does. He's still pretty active on social media.
[53:16.090 --> 53:18.910]  Yeah, he's pretty active, but I wonder if, like, does he know he has a store,
[53:19.010 --> 53:22.330]  or do his people run it for him? You know what I mean? I don't know.
[53:22.690 --> 53:25.830]  I'll tweet him about it. What's his name on Twitter? Is it William Shatner?
[53:26.490 --> 53:33.590]  Oh, you can get a Playmates Grand Nagas Zek Ferengi action figure. I don't think he ever
[53:33.590 --> 53:37.290]  dealt with the Ferengi, but okay. We'll see. We'll see if he gets back to me.
[53:37.330 --> 53:41.090]  I bet you he blocks me. If he engages with that tweet at all, it will be a block.
[53:41.510 --> 53:43.650]  Just looking at some of the props he's got for sale.
[53:43.650 --> 53:47.430]  I'm excited to buy the ties. I hope that nobody scoops the ties up.
[53:47.550 --> 53:48.190]  Well, buy it now.
[53:49.850 --> 53:52.150]  No. I'll wait. Add some suspense.
[53:52.570 --> 53:55.370]  You can get a Luke and Leia Swing to Freedom diorama.
[53:55.730 --> 53:59.530]  They have more Star Wars stuff? I didn't know they had more Star Wars things. I only saw...
[53:59.530 --> 54:05.010]  If you click on Other Franchises, you can get Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters, and Marvels.
[54:05.210 --> 54:09.250]  That's out of print as well. There's some Battlestar Galactica toys. There's an Andy
[54:09.250 --> 54:17.310]  Griffith Show DVD. Everybody remembers the Rachel Leigh Cook movie Sally. That's in there.
[54:17.630 --> 54:20.550]  No replies to the tweet yet from Shatner.
[54:20.810 --> 54:25.130]  No replies to the tweet. We'll see. Would you like to buy Boston legal prop
[54:25.130 --> 54:31.350]  Joan Zelda's Employee of the Year from 2004 Season 2? There's fire. I don't know who Joan
[54:31.350 --> 54:35.830]  Zelda is. I don't know if that was a random character. Yeah, it was. It was a random
[54:35.830 --> 54:41.390]  character in the show. $150. Maybe this is a cheaper award we can buy than William Shatner's
[54:41.990 --> 54:45.570]  Broadcasting Hall of Fame. That was just... I don't know. It's one of the weirdest things I've
[54:45.570 --> 54:48.970]  encountered. So I've wanted to share it for a while now. And it just kept slipping out of...
[54:48.970 --> 54:52.910]  I feel like I got lost in it for a little bit. I'm going down a Shatner rabbit hole.
[54:53.110 --> 54:58.230]  Could I... I've... I got one more. You're speaking of things existing on the internet
[54:58.230 --> 55:04.510]  that people just don't know about. I had another discovery recently that I feel like...
[55:04.510 --> 55:10.330]  It feels very internet. It feels very much like Rap for Jesus, but undiscovered. I went through and
[55:10.330 --> 55:15.590]  I listened to every state song and I ranked them. I did a whole list of state songs. I listened to
[55:15.590 --> 55:20.590]  all of them. Some states have multiple songs. Tennessee has like eight different state songs
[55:20.590 --> 55:25.330]  that I went through. And one of their state songs, this is not the state song, it is the
[55:25.330 --> 55:32.250]  official bicentennial rap of Tennessee. I'm going to post them like here. I'm imagining the woman in
[55:32.250 --> 55:37.290]  the thumbnail is rapping. This is delightful. It only has like a very minimal amount of views,
[55:37.390 --> 55:42.250]  like 10,000, 12,000 views. The internet should know about the Tennessee bicentennial rap.
[55:42.450 --> 55:46.230]  How did you find this? Well, because I was going through state capitals.
[55:46.330 --> 55:51.850]  Yeah, but why did you decide to do that? It was a Jeopardy trivia question of what
[55:51.850 --> 55:56.170]  state has eight capitals? And the answer was Tennessee. And I was like, I should listen to
[55:56.170 --> 56:01.730]  all the Tennessee capitals. And then it evolved to, I should listen to every state capital and
[56:01.730 --> 56:06.610]  rank them all and determine what state has the best capital song. I gotta listen to some of this.
[56:06.790 --> 56:09.230]  This is the best rap song I've ever heard in my entire life.
[56:13.290 --> 56:17.330]  It's good. It's something.
[56:23.410 --> 56:29.330]  It's very good. Jackson, Polk, and Johnson, three. God damn.
[56:30.310 --> 56:33.790]  I really like whiskey, whiskey, sipping smooth, moon, moon, pies.
[56:34.590 --> 56:38.830]  Here's a question. This was from 1996. Do you think she's still alive?
[56:39.350 --> 56:46.050]  I believe that she is an eternal being, Geoff. It was 15 years ago.
[56:46.270 --> 56:49.090]  This song is just a list. It is.
[56:51.550 --> 56:57.030]  What was the budget for that, do you think? Probably the same as the show, I'd assume.
[57:00.130 --> 57:03.450]  Maybe she'll go halfsies with us on the Shatner Award.
[57:05.890 --> 57:08.170]  Dude, so you've ranked them all. How long did this take?
[57:08.470 --> 57:13.070]  I did this all in one evening. It was probably like six hours. The best one,
[57:13.150 --> 57:18.390]  and it almost feels like it's cheating to use known artists, but it's West Virginia's Country
[57:18.390 --> 57:23.730]  Roads, Take Me Home. It's a great, great song. It's a state song. That's a state song?
[57:23.730 --> 57:28.150]  That is the state song. That is the official state song of West Virginia's Country Roads.
[57:28.570 --> 57:33.770]  Number two, once again, it just feels like sort of cheating. It's Georgia on My Mind by Ray Charles,
[57:33.910 --> 57:40.390]  specifically, is Georgia's state song. The worst on my list is Maine, State of Maine.
[57:40.910 --> 57:44.890]  Maine state song. Terrible. I'm gonna guess it's choir. I ranked a lot of the choir
[57:44.890 --> 57:48.710]  songs pretty low. Not into that kind of music?
[57:48.710 --> 57:53.390]  Not into that kind of... it's just not like you kind of... there's kind of a limited range.
[57:54.850 --> 58:00.790]  I will say that, like, as far as surprises go, New Mexico has a banger of a state song.
[58:02.110 --> 58:07.510]  Oh Fair, New Mexico. It's just... it's a vibe. Like, it feels like it should have been a Breaking
[58:07.510 --> 58:13.270]  Bad. It's a great... let me see if I can find Oh Fair, New Mexico. What qualifies as a state song?
[58:13.350 --> 58:17.430]  Like, it was written specifically for the state? It was written specifically for the state,
[58:17.430 --> 58:21.750]  and typically they vote to have it be, like, the official... So, like,
[58:21.890 --> 58:26.770]  Lynyrd Skynyrd singing about Alabama, that wasn't written for the state? No. That was not... that
[58:26.770 --> 58:31.710]  is not... they did not go through the process to make that the state song. I think New Jersey
[58:31.710 --> 58:36.710]  doesn't have a state song, and it's like they agreed that they were gonna have one, but then
[58:36.710 --> 58:41.070]  the governor just didn't do the paperwork, so it doesn't have it, or something like that. Like,
[58:41.390 --> 58:46.630]  he just forgot. There are, like, three or four state songs that just stole the music from Oh
[58:46.630 --> 58:51.370]  Christmas Tree. They just are like, this is a great instrumental track, we're gonna swap the
[58:51.370 --> 58:56.870]  lyrics and just use it. There's, like, four of them that are just that. It was quite the journey
[58:56.870 --> 59:03.110]  going state by state. But, New Mexico's Oh Fair, New Mexico. Let's see, is this the... yeah,
[59:03.190 --> 59:06.610]  this is it. I mean, you don't have to... this is a four and a half minute song, I don't think
[59:06.610 --> 59:12.390]  it's necessarily worth listening to all of it, but it's a banger, as far as state songs go.
[59:12.390 --> 59:15.870]  Oh Fair, New Mexico. Yeah. Oh, I like the...
[59:17.230 --> 59:22.490]  I'm telling you, it's a fucking... it's a banger of a song. Nice guitar work. You don't want to
[59:22.490 --> 59:25.710]  listen to four and a half minutes. It totally sounds like it should be a Breaking Bad,
[59:25.830 --> 59:30.290]  like one of those pulled opens or something. Yeah, it feels like a Breaking Bad thing. It
[59:30.290 --> 59:34.650]  sounds like it could be a song about Heisenberg. It does. Dude, this song's awesome. It's a great
[59:34.650 --> 59:41.510]  song. It's very high on the list of state songs. Great. Hell yeah, it's the home of the Montezuma.
[59:41.510 --> 59:45.530]  This is great. I did that, and then the next thing I did... see, this was one we took two weeks off,
[59:45.670 --> 59:49.290]  and I just missed you guys that I needed to fill, like, activity as it's doing things.
[59:49.490 --> 59:54.870]  I listened to every single original song Oscar winner and ranked those as well,
[59:55.090 --> 59:58.650]  so I got a full list. I've listened to every song that has won an Oscar for original song.
[01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:04.510]  I've been in the same boat as you. I just keep taking photos of Pedro Martina's
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:08.390]  baseball cards and scanning them into Photoshop. I'm excited to see the end result. Yeah,
[01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:13.830]  this is a way more exciting way to spend that idle, bored, lonely time than what I was doing.
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:19.190]  This is awesome. So the worst, apparently the worst song, I don't even remember what it sounds
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:25.590]  like, but the movie was called Papa's Delicate Condition, Call Me Irresponsible, 1963. The worst
[01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:30.550]  Oscar song of all time. The greatest Oscar song of all time is from Tarzan's You'll Be in My Heart
[01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:35.950]  in 1999. There's some songs that, to my surprise, didn't win Oscars on the list. Those are great,
[01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:39.870]  great pieces. The Oscar one took longer, like the States was one night,
[01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:43.870]  Oscars was like maybe four or five days. So what are you going to do with, are you going to
[01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:49.330]  publish these lists somewhere? I don't know. I just wanted to build the lists. I guess I could
[01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:55.570]  publish them somewhere. I feel like now that they exist, they need to be the official f*** face.
[01:00:56.170 --> 01:01:02.410]  Yeah, I'm just surprised you went with these songs as your first great f*** face lists,
[01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:06.910]  though. I feel like different dressings would have been one of your very first lists.
[01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:10.790]  Well, I'd have to go out and buy dressings. This is just me on YouTube. I just listen
[01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:13.850]  to things. It's a lot easier. I could just do this from the comfort of my bed,
[01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:17.510]  going through, listening to songs. There are songs I didn't realize were movie songs,
[01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:21.930]  like Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head. No idea, but that was the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid
[01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:26.190]  song. I didn't know that. It's a good-ass movie, dude. A bunch of Christmas songs,
[01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:29.010]  like White Christmas, that's a movie song that won an Oscar.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:31.390]  That's from Holiday Inn, isn't it?
[01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:37.190]  White Christmas... where is that from? It's funny doing these, because you set lines,
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:45.110]  like there's the Shaft line, there was the Mona Lisa line, these different... yeah, Holiday Inn,
[01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:48.490]  White Christmas, you're right, 1942. Not age great, that one.
[01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:56.070]  No, I guess not. What has, at this point? It was interesting listening to Baby It's
[01:01:56.070 --> 01:02:00.270]  Cold Outside, like the verses were reversed than what is commonly done.
[01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:05.030]  What, like male-female reversed? Yeah, like it opens female, and then it goes
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:09.890]  male, and then it goes back and forth, where traditionally, when people hear that song,
[01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:15.290]  it opens male, and it kind of stays male, but the roles reverse within the movie,
[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.830]  and within the singing of the version that won an Oscar. It's fascinating.
[01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:23.630]  It's a very historic... historical. Very historical episode of f***face.
[01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:29.310]  Yes, the important history of Oscar movie songs and William Shatner's award history.
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.890]  And we got to the bottom of Humpty Dumpty, don't forget that.
[01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:38.530]  I like that we never know what an episode is gonna be like.
[01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:44.430]  Yeah, we popped the can on that controversy and got into it.
[01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:49.950]  Eric wants us to start stopping, so we should probably... does anybody have any
[01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:54.030]  shit they wanna cover before we stop? Do you think Shatner's selling any
[01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:58.550]  pieces of the Humpty Dumpty canon? I wanna buy some of his hair.
[01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:04.270]  I wanna buy an old hair piece. We should start selling stuff from the show.
[01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:07.530]  You should cut up your watering can and start selling pieces of it.
[01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:13.130]  I wanna start selling the cards we break. I was thinking, I could put in a...
[01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:19.170]  they have different display cases for cards. I could put your Ice Ice Baby thing that you made,
[01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:23.370]  which was a vanilla ice card, a vanilla ice card, and then a picture of a rad dude baby.
[01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:27.310]  I think I could put those next to each other, three by... in a glass case,
[01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:31.830]  or plastic case, and sell that sucker on eBay for fucking dollars.
[01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.970]  Yeah, not as much as William Shatner's Broadcast Award.
[01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:37.810]  Probably not, but you never know. You gotta start somewhere.
[01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.670]  Oh, also, before we wrap, I wanted to do one thing. When we were talking last in person,
[01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:48.210]  I guess it would have been that break show, Eric mentioned in passing, just like... I don't even
[01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:52.290]  remember what the context was, but he mentioned again how long it takes to get dry with a blow
[01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:57.370]  dryer out of the shower, and once again, reminding me that he misunderstood the instructions of that.
[01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.270]  And so when I was taking a shower this morning, I thought I would do something.
[01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.510]  It was when I had my... I mentioned this last episode, I had some bad bathroom insights.
[01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:09.890]  Very small, very minor, but I thought I would dry myself like I normally do, but I timed the
[01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:16.390]  process to see how much blow dryer you should be using to dry yourself off, and it's 29 seconds.
[01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:21.510]  So if you're blow drying more than 29 seconds to dry yourself, then you didn't dry yourself
[01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:27.170]  off enough with the towel. So... I mean for a six foot tall man who weighs roughly 175. So it's the
[01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:32.650]  blow dryer just to remove the clamminess post towel. Yeah, it's just like to hit those little, like,
[01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.390]  the crevices that are still kind of wet and gross, and to give you a night... because you're already
[01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:40.530]  blow drying your hair, and then like, then I notice like, oh my beard's full of water, so you blow dry
[01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:43.510]  your beard, and that feels good, and then the water goes down to your neck, so then you blow dry your
[01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.990]  neck, and then before you know it, you're like, oh, if I could just continue this down, I feel better,
[01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:51.550]  I feel great, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to dive back into season one content or anything,
[01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:56.410]  I just thought, for posterity's sake, because it bugged me that he just walked out of a shower
[01:04:56.410 --> 01:05:01.430]  sopping wet and tried to dry himself off, and then as if, as if my, my technique was flawed,
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:07.210]  uh, so I, I dried myself off. Electrocution risk. Yeah, so what you should do, dry yourself off, and then,
[01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:11.590]  and then, uh, about 29 seconds or so is about the amount of time you should be under the blow dryer.
[01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:15.790]  And if you're doing more than that, you probably didn't dry off enough. Why don't they build
[01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:20.650]  a hair dryer, why don't they build them into the shower heads, so you could just flip from one mode
[01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:26.250]  to the other? Dude, I think that thing might exist. I mean, our bidets do it for our buttholes, right?
[01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:33.110]  It's true, and I, I once used a, uh, I think it was a Dyson tap in a bathroom above the sink, and you get
[01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:39.070]  the water out, and then it switches to dry mode, and it just fires air down into the sink at all
[01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:44.850]  the water and blows it all over your shirt. It's a really great invention. Also, this morning while
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:49.950]  I was doing that, uh, I realized another, this, and maybe you guys are already doing this, maybe I'm late to the game,
[01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:54.490]  but if you're not, I want to throw it out there, because at 46 years, never crossed my mind,
[01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:58.670]  uh, we've been out of q-tips for a while. Uh, we ran out, we keep forgetting to buy them at the
[01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:02.530]  grocery store, so we bought some q-tips last night, and I got so fucking excited to use the q-tips.
[01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:08.030]  I dual-wielded the q-tips, and when I was doing it, I realized, I've never done that before. I've always
[01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:12.850]  been a one-year-at-a-time q-tipper. Dual-wielded it, it's a little stressful because you're trying,
[01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:18.510]  you're doing two things at once, but talk about a time saver. I've cut my q-tipping time in half.
[01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:23.910]  But that's all bullshit. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't, it does nothing but, like, push wax
[01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:27.910]  against your eardrum. They're shite, you shouldn't use them. No, it takes the wax out, that's why
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:33.190]  it's on the q-tip. No, you need the wax in there. No, you need some wax in there. But the excess wax is,
[01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:38.330]  is, is what is pushing down and, like, impacting. No, I'm not doing that. Very bad for you,
[01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:44.190]  especially two at a time. I've had to fart for two hours. Can we end this? I need to, I'm, I need,
[01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:48.790]  what's going on with Andrew? I've been holding in a fart for two fucking hours. Can we end that?
[01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:51.510]  Just let it go, what do you mean? I thought we were wrapping. Well, I've been holding it in.
[01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.350]  Why are you holding it in? We can't smell it. It doesn't matter to us. No, it would be loud.
[01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:59.250]  I don't know, I didn't, I didn't want to interrupt. I don't know. You're a loud fart. All right, well,
[01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:05.890]  let's, let's end it on your fart. Andrew, fart us out live. We'll, we'll fart it out live, Andrew.
[01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:09.930]  This is, well, you know the pressure of farting now, like trying to capture it,
[01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:13.930]  so it's going to be a disappointment, but I'll try. Two-hour fart. Hey, thank you for listening
[01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:17.690]  to F*** Face. Uh, we, we're going to end on a high note. We're going to end on a two-hour fart.
[01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:36.500]  We'll see you next week. And I released it a little bit because I thought we were wrapping
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:41.540]  up.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.980]  It sounded like a soggy engine trying to turn over.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.460]  It sounded like you're trying to start a lawnmower.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.780]  Oh, why was that so good? It was just really not disappointing at all, and it came over
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:20.860]  perfectly through Discord. Oh my God, that was so loud. Did you like tilt up to do that,
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:25.020]  or was that just where you, where you sat? No, no, I put the microphone to my ass,
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:29.440]  but I don't know what I did. I've been ripping homers for like the last 12 hours. It's,
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:35.640]  I just can't stop. Oh, I don't know you, but that was, that was definitely a homer. Oh my God.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.840]  Zimmer would be proud. Oh, we've become a fart podcast. I think we always have been.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:51.860]  We weren't doing them on the recordings. Oh God. Well, I can't, I don't think we could
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.640]  have asked for a better ending.
