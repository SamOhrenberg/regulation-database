[00:33.000 --> 00:35.440]  Hello and welcome to another... what was that?
[00:36.080 --> 00:38.360]  Gavin went mmm, and then I didn't hear your hello.
[00:38.480 --> 00:40.440]  I heard ello, welcome to.
[00:41.060 --> 00:42.700]  Your open was weird for me.
[00:42.700 --> 00:44.960]  Like, Discord didn't pick it up. I'm sure it sounds fine on your end.
[00:45.100 --> 00:46.020]  I just didn't.
[00:46.040 --> 00:47.400]  Well, why don't you do it then?
[00:47.740 --> 00:49.480]  Hello and welcome to episode...
[00:49.480 --> 00:50.720]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[00:50.800 --> 00:52.220]  You're cut off from me as well.
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.340]  Yeah, the H, right?
[00:53.440 --> 00:53.680]  Ello!
[00:54.440 --> 00:56.240]  Yeah, so it sort of caught me off guard.
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.220]  Then Gavin hummed.
[00:57.740 --> 00:58.900]  Yeah, we need to...
[00:58.900 --> 01:02.520]  So I need a hard H in this intro
[01:02.520 --> 01:03.900]  or we're not going to be able to get started.
[01:03.980 --> 01:06.680]  Why don't I provide the H and Andrew continues?
[01:07.180 --> 01:08.800]  Got it. You throw it up, I'll catch.
[01:08.940 --> 01:09.080]  Yep.
[01:09.420 --> 01:11.100]  OK, I'm going to make a little bit of sound before the H,
[01:11.180 --> 01:12.440]  just so you definitely get it.
[01:12.440 --> 01:12.780]  I'm ready.
[01:14.980 --> 01:18.680]  Ello and welcome to episode 62,
[01:19.280 --> 01:20.800]  I believe, of F*** Face.
[01:21.160 --> 01:24.040]  As always, we're joined by myself,
[01:24.580 --> 01:27.980]  man with no name, Geoff Ramsey and Gavin Free.
[01:28.320 --> 01:28.720]  Hello there.
[01:28.800 --> 01:29.280]  We'll go back to back.
[01:29.500 --> 01:30.380]  How are you two doing?
[01:30.740 --> 01:31.840]  Oh, never been better.
[01:32.300 --> 01:33.140]  Never been better?
[01:34.520 --> 01:37.380]  Things are at an all time high for your old pal, Geoff.
[01:37.640 --> 01:38.760]  How about you guys?
[01:39.020 --> 01:40.040]  I, you know what, Geoff?
[01:40.060 --> 01:42.000]  You've gone through a lot of misery lately.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.980]  It seems like house stuff going wrong, all sorts of disasters.
[01:45.160 --> 01:48.260]  I had my own disaster that I wanted to talk about that.
[01:48.280 --> 01:49.060]  I was excited.
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.040]  I was excited to talk about.
[01:51.160 --> 01:53.580]  It's very rare that like something horrible happens.
[01:53.680 --> 01:55.180]  I'm like, I can't wait to talk about this
[01:55.180 --> 01:59.960]  because this is one of the most absurd me problems I've encountered in a long time.
[02:00.460 --> 02:04.080]  We've been very cooking centric recently, and it is a cooking thing.
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.540]  But I tried to make ramen and like ramen's great.
[02:08.540 --> 02:10.840]  Love ramen. Don't have it all that often.
[02:10.840 --> 02:12.020]  With or without the Keurig?
[02:12.500 --> 02:13.540]  Without the Keurig.
[02:13.680 --> 02:15.460]  So that's that's an important no.
[02:15.780 --> 02:18.540]  No Keurig, because this was I typically buy
[02:18.540 --> 02:22.060]  and I think most people get the pre-containered ramen.
[02:22.260 --> 02:23.160]  Like it's already in a thing.
[02:23.260 --> 02:24.380]  You pour the water into it.
[02:24.600 --> 02:25.480]  You heat the water up.
[02:25.540 --> 02:26.200]  Then you seal it.
[02:26.640 --> 02:28.000]  This was just ramen by itself.
[02:28.160 --> 02:29.120]  Like a pot noodle.
[02:29.420 --> 02:32.760]  Yeah, like a like a pot, like a cup of noodle style thing.
[02:33.100 --> 02:34.400]  This is just ramen in a bag.
[02:34.460 --> 02:35.940]  So just noodle, plastic bag.
[02:36.420 --> 02:38.360]  Got your your whatever seasoning.
[02:38.940 --> 02:40.080]  Yeah, that's how I do my ramen.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.240]  Usually it's just the packet.
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.540]  Really? You do the packet?
[02:42.820 --> 02:45.380]  That's that's not that's a less it's a less common.
[02:45.620 --> 02:47.520]  I watched the whole thing about ramen recently.
[02:47.660 --> 02:50.000]  It's not as popular as the cup cup ramen.
[02:50.220 --> 02:51.060]  It's way more popular.
[02:51.180 --> 02:53.300]  Anyway, I typically get the cup ramen.
[02:53.580 --> 02:56.280]  So I've had this pack ramen and I could never.
[02:56.620 --> 02:58.800]  And I don't know if this is just a weird in my head thing.
[02:58.940 --> 03:01.260]  I could never get the water boiling enough.
[03:01.280 --> 03:04.000]  I felt like to like properly heat the ramen.
[03:04.380 --> 03:08.740]  Like I'd always feel like I was putting in like kind of medium heat water.
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.500]  And it wasn't just doing nothing.
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.720]  It was just soggy ramen.
[03:11.920 --> 03:12.600]  Like it wasn't cooking.
[03:13.220 --> 03:14.700]  And this would drive me crazy.
[03:14.940 --> 03:15.520]  Go ahead.
[03:16.160 --> 03:16.460]  So wait.
[03:16.600 --> 03:20.600]  So in every recipe that you've ever made, you struggle with like step one.
[03:21.040 --> 03:21.780]  Boil the water.
[03:21.960 --> 03:23.520]  For ramen in the plastic.
[03:23.660 --> 03:27.000]  Yeah, well, because I just I feel like I don't know how to like I don't boil it
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.800]  enough or I just I'm bad at judging.
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.120]  What does it look like?
[03:30.440 --> 03:31.800]  I don't understand that question.
[03:31.900 --> 03:32.220]  What do you mean?
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.140]  What is the water is rapidly bubbling?
[03:35.560 --> 03:37.300]  Like, how do you not understand the question?
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.860]  OK, well, it's I.
[03:39.100 --> 03:40.920]  You know, you get the tiny bubbles, you get the tiny.
[03:41.280 --> 03:41.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:41.740 --> 03:42.160]  I understand.
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.880]  It's like the chilling happens.
[03:44.040 --> 03:45.780]  This is why this is why I open with.
[03:45.920 --> 03:47.160]  I think it's an in my head thing.
[03:47.240 --> 03:51.240]  I think I'm probably pouring fucking lava into the bowl when I do it.
[03:51.280 --> 03:53.260]  But in my head, I'm like, this isn't boiling enough.
[03:53.540 --> 03:54.280]  I'm not doing enough.
[03:54.320 --> 03:55.840]  There's no such thing as boiling enough.
[03:55.920 --> 03:57.440]  Boiling is boiling or isn't.
[03:57.440 --> 03:58.660]  You can't have hotter than boiling.
[03:58.780 --> 04:00.460]  And if it's below that, it's not boiling.
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.120]  What it is is I put I put it in the bowl and then I cover the bowl
[04:04.120 --> 04:05.620]  and I can't see what the water is doing.
[04:05.620 --> 04:08.180]  In my head, I'm convinced that I've ruined the boil in the trance.
[04:08.540 --> 04:09.500]  Why are you covering it?
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.860]  Well, because you're supposed to to keep the heat in.
[04:12.120 --> 04:13.060]  It's supposed to keep things.
[04:13.180 --> 04:13.720]  I don't know.
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.040]  I'm just saying I've been a rational.
[04:15.300 --> 04:18.780]  I've always been a rational thing when it comes to heat with ramen in the water.
[04:18.900 --> 04:20.220]  I feel like I'm never doing it right.
[04:20.560 --> 04:23.300]  The only thing that's going to affect your boiling water is your altitude.
[04:24.080 --> 04:26.580]  Andrew, I feel like you've been very clear that this is irrational.
[04:26.580 --> 04:29.060]  And I feel like Gavin keeps pointing out that it's irrational.
[04:29.240 --> 04:32.700]  But does this affect you in other things or is it just in terms
[04:32.700 --> 04:33.840]  of boiling water for ramen?
[04:33.840 --> 04:35.180]  Do you have trouble boiling water for?
[04:35.680 --> 04:36.260]  I don't know.
[04:36.340 --> 04:38.000]  I was going to say eggs, but you don't eat eggs.
[04:38.060 --> 04:39.440]  So I don't know what else you would boil.
[04:39.680 --> 04:42.220]  Yeah, I guess your example would be maybe something like a tea.
[04:42.360 --> 04:43.640]  Yeah. No, not really.
[04:43.980 --> 04:44.740]  I don't know why.
[04:44.840 --> 04:47.900]  There's something about the fact that I feel like I'm supposed to be cooking this.
[04:48.160 --> 04:51.440]  I think there's a weird thing in my head of like I'm undercooking the ramen
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.760]  somehow or I'm just ruining it.
[04:52.920 --> 04:55.780]  I'm not having the optimal ramen experience that I could be having,
[04:56.260 --> 04:57.800]  but I only have this in a bag.
[04:57.900 --> 05:00.520]  This isn't an issue when it's in a cup for some reason.
[05:00.740 --> 05:03.240]  Anyway, so you can boil it and pour it into a cup.
[05:03.240 --> 05:05.780]  But if you boil it and put the ramen in.
[05:05.940 --> 05:08.900]  Yeah, because it's like I got an open face bowl and I don't know.
[05:08.940 --> 05:11.420]  There's just I've said this so many times.
[05:11.500 --> 05:12.880]  It's not a rational thing.
[05:13.220 --> 05:14.660]  It's just how my brain is.
[05:14.940 --> 05:17.360]  I feel like I'm losing heat in the transfer.
[05:17.720 --> 05:20.220]  So I've been struggling with like, well, how am I going to do this?
[05:20.300 --> 05:24.400]  And so I came up with the perfect way to make this and not have to worry about
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.600]  that is what if I put the ramen in the boiling water
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.460]  instead of bringing the water to the ramen?
[05:30.960 --> 05:35.500]  I didn't have a I didn't like have a proper like pan that I could do that.
[05:35.560 --> 05:37.320]  I never even like occurred to me to use a pan.
[05:37.440 --> 05:38.940]  The pots I have are too big.
[05:39.080 --> 05:43.320]  I'm confused as to your process before that, because because isn't that what you do?
[05:43.380 --> 05:45.780]  You get a pan, you boil the water and then you drop the ramen.
[05:46.180 --> 05:48.600]  See, that's that's maybe where confusion is.
[05:48.660 --> 05:49.580]  I've never done that.
[05:49.660 --> 05:53.720]  I've always poured the water out of the pan into the bowl with the ramen in it.
[05:53.720 --> 05:55.020]  I've never put the ramen in the bowl.
[05:55.480 --> 05:56.700]  I've been doing it the other way.
[05:56.700 --> 06:00.480]  But you're supposed to boil the ramen for 30 for three minutes, right?
[06:00.920 --> 06:03.260]  Well, you put it in the hot water for like three minutes.
[06:03.620 --> 06:04.720]  It's yeah, well, it boils.
[06:05.120 --> 06:06.580]  Yeah, but like, I guess I don't know.
[06:06.660 --> 06:08.300]  I just that's what it never occurred to me.
[06:08.760 --> 06:10.800]  OK, yeah, mine's bubbling away.
[06:10.860 --> 06:13.660]  And then I chuck the ramen in and then it bubbles less
[06:13.660 --> 06:15.540]  because the heat in the water is going into the ramen.
[06:15.740 --> 06:18.860]  And then you still have the heat on for a few minutes.
[06:19.220 --> 06:21.640]  And three minutes later, you pour the sauce in and then you eat it.
[06:21.880 --> 06:22.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[06:22.520 --> 06:26.500]  Well, I just that's where I was screwing up when I was doing it in in a
[06:27.560 --> 06:30.880]  package, I would move the water to the thing because in a cup, you don't.
[06:31.160 --> 06:31.560]  It's dangerous as shit.
[06:31.820 --> 06:33.600]  You're just pouring boiling water into a bowl.
[06:33.780 --> 06:35.720]  Oh, yeah, I'm pouring it into a bowl.
[06:35.840 --> 06:36.340]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:36.500 --> 06:37.480]  That's that was my system.
[06:37.680 --> 06:38.760]  How are you alive?
[06:39.080 --> 06:39.940]  It's an extreme splash hazard.
[06:40.500 --> 06:43.780]  So I thought I'm going to bring the ramen to the water instead.
[06:44.080 --> 06:46.540]  And so I put it in a fucking kettle.
[06:46.880 --> 06:48.240]  I've got this big kettle.
[06:48.240 --> 06:49.560]  It's like a ceramic kettle.
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.480]  And it was I'm like, this is a genius idea.
[06:52.900 --> 06:53.760]  What do you do with pasta?
[06:54.220 --> 06:55.700]  I don't really make pasta all that much.
[06:55.700 --> 06:57.360]  I'm not a big pasta guy.
[06:57.440 --> 06:58.760]  I assume you wouldn't have that in the bowl.
[06:59.100 --> 07:02.720]  Yeah, I just I feel like that's a bigger bowl item than a ramen thing.
[07:02.860 --> 07:03.900]  Ramen things are small.
[07:04.380 --> 07:05.120]  Real quick.
[07:05.220 --> 07:09.240]  Are you saying pasta as to comfort or assuage Gavin?
[07:09.300 --> 07:10.940]  Or is that also how you say it?
[07:11.200 --> 07:13.120]  I never know if it's pasta or pasta.
[07:13.280 --> 07:15.500]  It's a Chevy Chevy Chase situation for me.
[07:15.500 --> 07:16.700]  I never know what's right.
[07:16.800 --> 07:17.880]  Sometimes I say pasta.
[07:18.180 --> 07:19.580]  Sometimes I say pasta.
[07:19.820 --> 07:20.360]  Just curious.
[07:20.460 --> 07:23.020]  Gavin's the only person I know that says pasta.
[07:23.160 --> 07:24.880]  So I didn't know if it was maybe you and Gavin
[07:24.880 --> 07:27.540]  or maybe it's a Canadian British thing or you were just.
[07:27.660 --> 07:28.000]  I don't know.
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.140]  Just it's like, yeah, gotcha.
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.100]  Much like you, Geoff.
[07:31.160 --> 07:32.700]  I'm trying to just please people.
[07:32.820 --> 07:34.000]  I don't know what they want me to say.
[07:34.040 --> 07:35.460]  I'll say pasta. I'll say pasta.
[07:35.580 --> 07:36.380]  It doesn't matter to me.
[07:36.540 --> 07:37.620]  I never know it's correct.
[07:37.840 --> 07:38.640]  I don't care either way.
[07:38.680 --> 07:41.040]  I was just curious as to the the reasoning behind it.
[07:41.060 --> 07:41.420]  That's all.
[07:41.620 --> 07:47.280]  So I put the the fucking ramen in the kettle and it's boiling hot.
[07:47.340 --> 07:47.880]  Like it is.
[07:48.160 --> 07:49.680]  There's smoke shooting out the end of it.
[07:49.700 --> 07:51.440]  I'm like, this is going to be great ramen.
[07:51.960 --> 07:54.360]  So I turn I turn steam.
[07:54.500 --> 07:57.220]  I turn I turn the heat off.
[07:57.460 --> 07:58.840]  I'm like, this is really hot.
[07:58.880 --> 07:59.600]  I'm going to turn off.
[07:59.700 --> 08:02.100]  And I decide, no, I want to turn it back on.
[08:02.160 --> 08:03.380]  I want to keep those bubbles going.
[08:03.460 --> 08:05.540]  We got to keep we got to get a good ramen cook going.
[08:05.780 --> 08:07.460]  I walk away for 30 seconds.
[08:07.460 --> 08:08.280]  I come back.
[08:08.380 --> 08:12.200]  All the water shooting out of the kettle covering the electric stovetop.
[08:12.660 --> 08:16.720]  Smoke is shooting everywhere as the water the water hits steam.
[08:17.020 --> 08:19.100]  It's just it's it's going everywhere.
[08:19.100 --> 08:21.160]  There's a smoke alarm that I've set off nearby.
[08:21.340 --> 08:24.240]  It is 1245 a.m. on a Sunday morning.
[08:24.340 --> 08:28.380]  And if my fire alarm goes off, everyone in the building's fire alarm goes off.
[08:28.820 --> 08:33.320]  And at that hour, I feel like there's people are going to leave the building at this time.
[08:33.480 --> 08:36.160]  Because you're going to get this is going to be a problem.
[08:36.240 --> 08:39.060]  The steam set off the smoke detector.
[08:39.280 --> 08:44.280]  Well, no, I was scared it would because the whole fucking kitchen just got coated like I couldn't see.
[08:44.360 --> 08:45.740]  It was just everywhere.
[08:46.120 --> 08:48.540]  It was sizzling stove kettle.
[08:48.540 --> 08:49.620]  It's not an electric one.
[08:49.840 --> 08:51.120]  No, no, it's it's a stone.
[08:51.240 --> 08:53.160]  Yeah, it's like it's not an electric kettle at all.
[08:53.460 --> 08:54.960]  It's it's like a heavier stone one.
[08:55.100 --> 08:56.420]  So then you're going to see it in a minute.
[08:57.040 --> 08:57.680]  I panicked.
[08:57.820 --> 09:00.080]  I run out of the kitchen.
[09:00.240 --> 09:01.800]  I open up the patio door.
[09:01.900 --> 09:03.020]  I'm turning fans on.
[09:03.100 --> 09:06.400]  I am terrified that this is going to trigger the alarm.
[09:06.660 --> 09:07.540]  It doesn't.
[09:07.620 --> 09:08.260]  We're all good.
[09:08.320 --> 09:09.700]  I'm like, oh, thank God.
[09:09.720 --> 09:11.880]  Like, this is what a fucking chaotic mess.
[09:11.880 --> 09:14.240]  This is this is a true disaster.
[09:14.740 --> 09:16.200]  I'm going to I'm going to then share.
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.540]  So what I realized, I didn't think this plan through.
[09:18.740 --> 09:21.260]  It's really tough to get ramen out of a kettle.
[09:21.500 --> 09:23.400]  It is not designed to work.
[09:26.220 --> 09:27.360]  Wait, go ahead.
[09:28.540 --> 09:30.420]  I've just missed an important part of this.
[09:31.080 --> 09:32.940]  OK, the ramen is inside the kettle.
[09:33.380 --> 09:34.920]  Yeah, I dropped the ramen in the kettle.
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.280]  I was cooking it all in the kettle.
[09:38.500 --> 09:39.860]  I missed that part.
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.100]  Yeah, no, I put I put because all the water is boiling and I didn't have a pan.
[09:44.100 --> 09:46.980]  So I'm cooking everything within the kettle.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.360]  Because it stays boiling.
[09:51.480 --> 09:52.220]  It's going to cook well.
[09:52.360 --> 09:53.540]  And it was a great idea.
[09:54.080 --> 09:55.560]  It's the same as a pan.
[09:55.820 --> 09:56.680]  It's the same.
[09:57.680 --> 09:59.960]  You put a spout around your pan.
[10:00.060 --> 10:00.740]  That's what you've done.
[10:01.200 --> 10:02.120]  It's well, it's a deeper.
[10:02.240 --> 10:03.720]  I don't have any deep pans.
[10:03.840 --> 10:07.760]  I feel like the pans I have would not be deep enough for water to cook the ramen.
[10:09.360 --> 10:10.580]  How do you cook anything?
[10:11.080 --> 10:12.600]  Why do you keep saying pan?
[10:12.680 --> 10:13.540]  Put it in a pot.
[10:13.540 --> 10:14.580]  Put it in a pot.
[10:14.860 --> 10:15.740]  I feel like the pot is too big.
[10:15.740 --> 10:16.620]  You make cookies in a pan.
[10:16.780 --> 10:18.260]  You make ramen in a pot.
[10:18.380 --> 10:21.760]  Yeah, when I say pan, I mean like saucepan, like a yeah, pot.
[10:22.120 --> 10:22.540]  That's what I mean.
[10:22.880 --> 10:24.600]  Okay, well, okay.
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.840]  You must have those.
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.240]  Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to cook anything.
[10:27.600 --> 10:29.640]  I have a fucking tank of one, okay?
[10:29.720 --> 10:34.140]  And it just seemed absurd to cook this little square thing of ramen in a tank of a pan.
[10:34.320 --> 10:35.720]  How did you jam it in a kettle?
[10:35.740 --> 10:40.080]  And it doesn't seem absurd to jam it into a tea kettle.
[10:40.380 --> 10:40.980]  You're going to...
[10:40.980 --> 10:42.240]  Well, I didn't jam it in, okay?
[10:42.240 --> 10:43.800]  It fit perfectly fine.
[10:43.900 --> 10:47.480]  I put the ramen in, then all the water started shooting out the broth,
[10:47.620 --> 10:50.200]  and it fucking caused the smoke-steam disaster.
[10:50.540 --> 10:52.020]  We deal with that.
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.440]  And then we get to the part where we need to pour the ramen out of the kettle.
[10:57.740 --> 11:00.240]  And it is not easy to do that.
[11:00.520 --> 11:01.920]  The shape of it is inconvenient.
[11:01.920 --> 11:02.520]  No shit.
[11:03.200 --> 11:06.460]  So at first, because I got so much water, it's a big kettle.
[11:06.720 --> 11:07.900]  So at first, I drained...
[11:07.900 --> 11:10.760]  It's literally the only thing designed for liquid only.
[11:10.760 --> 11:13.140]  Well, you can cook ramen in it, too.
[11:13.580 --> 11:14.240]  Confirm this.
[11:14.420 --> 11:15.800]  You can cook it, but can you get it out?
[11:16.500 --> 11:17.900]  That's the dilemma, Geoff.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.860]  So I start draining the broth, because there's way too much broth.
[11:20.940 --> 11:22.680]  And I'm like, the kettle's fucking hot.
[11:22.780 --> 11:24.060]  How am I going to navigate this?
[11:24.080 --> 11:24.760]  How am I going to move it?
[11:25.040 --> 11:30.920]  So my issue is, I go to pour the ramen out of the kettle, and then it goes clunk.
[11:31.160 --> 11:32.460]  Like, it clunks down.
[11:33.060 --> 11:36.120]  The kettle joined with the bowl.
[11:36.300 --> 11:37.980]  It locked into each other.
[11:38.060 --> 11:39.260]  They became trapped.
[11:39.260 --> 11:44.280]  I could not remove the kettle from the bowl that I was trying to pour it into.
[11:44.520 --> 11:45.900]  And the bowl is half filled.
[11:45.980 --> 11:46.960]  So we're going to put this image in.
[11:47.140 --> 11:48.180]  This is exactly...
[11:48.180 --> 11:49.120]  So you're about to see what happens.
[11:49.120 --> 11:50.240]  What do you mean?
[11:50.560 --> 11:54.360]  So I'm trying to pour the noodles into the bowl.
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.640]  That's not a kettle.
[11:56.160 --> 11:56.620]  It is.
[11:56.880 --> 11:57.720]  That's absolutely a kettle.
[11:58.020 --> 11:59.040]  How is that a kettle?
[11:59.340 --> 12:01.420]  What are you talking about?
[12:01.660 --> 12:02.280]  That's a kettle.
[12:02.360 --> 12:02.700]  What do you mean?
[12:02.760 --> 12:03.680]  It's a fancy...
[12:03.680 --> 12:04.380]  It's like a...
[12:04.380 --> 12:05.840]  It's a ceramic kettle.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.800]  Where's the top?
[12:07.800 --> 12:09.540]  So the top pops off.
[12:09.580 --> 12:11.240]  So you see the metal handles on it?
[12:11.540 --> 12:13.500]  You fold up and that locks the top in.
[12:13.580 --> 12:14.760]  You can remove the top of it.
[12:15.040 --> 12:15.320]  Okay.
[12:15.740 --> 12:16.560]  It's a pan with a lid.
[12:16.700 --> 12:17.600]  No, it is a...
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.200]  I will fucking take a photo of this kettle later, fully formed.
[12:21.240 --> 12:22.720]  And you will see it's a goddamn kettle.
[12:22.800 --> 12:23.160]  Please do.
[12:23.260 --> 12:24.100]  Just trust me.
[12:24.180 --> 12:26.180]  It is a fancy, nice, goddamn kettle.
[12:26.280 --> 12:28.660]  I don't understand the difficulty getting it out then.
[12:28.700 --> 12:30.860]  Because you're just getting it out like you would any pot.
[12:31.200 --> 12:31.960]  No, because it's...
[12:31.960 --> 12:33.620]  Okay, so it's super hard to hold.
[12:33.760 --> 12:36.360]  And because it's fucking hot, because it's been on an oven forever,
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.200]  I have to hold the metal handle part.
[12:38.340 --> 12:40.240]  And it's just not easy to navigate.
[12:40.500 --> 12:42.800]  Plus, with broth, I'm putting it into a small bowl.
[12:43.300 --> 12:48.180]  But the real problem of this story, Gavin, is it's now locked itself to the bowl.
[12:48.380 --> 12:50.000]  I cannot move either thing.
[12:50.220 --> 12:51.460]  I do have oven mitts, Nick.
[12:51.580 --> 12:52.920]  They're in the fucking photo.
[12:53.040 --> 12:54.520]  It's still difficult to navigate.
[12:54.940 --> 12:55.960]  You weren't there.
[12:56.360 --> 12:57.720]  This was a real problem.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.980]  So is the metal bar that holds the lid on, is it gripped around the bowl?
[13:02.440 --> 13:03.480]  Let me show you...
[13:04.320 --> 13:05.720]  Just pop it back.
[13:05.720 --> 13:07.880]  No, you fucking idiot.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.060]  Yeah, just pop it back.
[13:09.060 --> 13:10.460]  Like, I didn't consider that.
[13:10.540 --> 13:12.380]  I spent 20 goddamn minutes.
[13:12.520 --> 13:13.800]  You're gonna call me an idiot.
[13:13.960 --> 13:15.660]  You're the one making ramen noodles in a kettle.
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.320]  Look at the handle, Geoff.
[13:17.420 --> 13:18.240]  Look at where it is.
[13:18.320 --> 13:18.980]  Just pop it off.
[13:18.980 --> 13:23.960]  I'm looking at the most bizarre kettle on planet Earth, Andrew.
[13:26.660 --> 13:27.620]  I cannot.
[13:28.120 --> 13:30.360]  I tried to lift the metal part back.
[13:30.400 --> 13:31.340]  It would not work.
[13:31.440 --> 13:32.700]  I tried to adjust it forth.
[13:32.720 --> 13:33.360]  Would not work.
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.460]  I cannot tilt the bowl because it's filled with my fucking broth.
[13:37.620 --> 13:39.080]  It's half filled with liquid.
[13:39.200 --> 13:40.660]  So I'm just stuck there.
[13:40.980 --> 13:43.220]  I spent 20 minutes trying to solve this.
[13:43.280 --> 13:43.920]  Hey, Gavin.
[13:44.260 --> 13:44.780]  Gavin.
[13:45.920 --> 13:46.440]  Gavin.
[13:46.840 --> 13:48.500]  Gavin, real quick, real quick.
[13:49.060 --> 13:51.020]  I'd just like you, in this moment, to take one...
[13:51.020 --> 13:56.380]  Oh, just take a beat and just realize this is the person I aligned myself with in the
[13:56.380 --> 13:57.260]  condiment argument.
[13:57.400 --> 13:59.520]  Oh, bad.
[13:59.520 --> 14:00.080]  Aligned next.
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.420]  Not with, but...
[14:01.420 --> 14:08.920]  I don't know why, of all the things in your cabinets, you picked this contraption to cook
[14:08.920 --> 14:09.500]  ramen in.
[14:09.860 --> 14:13.780]  Well, it was the most viable option that was on the top of the oven.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.280]  And I went with it.
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.300]  And I didn't expect it to fucking lock.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.340]  It was like a face hugger on a bowl.
[14:19.520 --> 14:20.520]  Like, I could not...
[14:20.520 --> 14:21.400]  There is no...
[14:21.400 --> 14:22.440]  There is no hope.
[14:22.560 --> 14:23.300]  I tried to do...
[14:23.300 --> 14:25.980]  Teach me how that kettle would work if there wasn't ramen in it.
[14:26.260 --> 14:28.100]  It, I assume, still gets very hot.
[14:28.500 --> 14:30.760]  It still has the thing where you have to pour it from.
[14:31.020 --> 14:31.180]  Yeah.
[14:31.180 --> 14:32.840]  How do you get the stuff out?
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.100]  You just, you tilt, you pour it down the front, the front end of it.
[14:36.200 --> 14:36.700]  What do you mean?
[14:36.840 --> 14:38.020]  Right back at it.
[14:38.220 --> 14:39.860]  If you can do that, then why don't you do that with a ramen?
[14:40.340 --> 14:43.720]  Because there's way too much ramen to do it and would just fall all over the place.
[14:43.800 --> 14:45.040]  I had to kind of guide it into the bowl.
[14:45.140 --> 14:46.580]  But surely you did that with the broth.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.540]  No, I didn't.
[14:47.620 --> 14:52.500]  With the broth, I got a cup and I put it in and I drained the broth that way until there
[14:52.500 --> 14:56.580]  was an adequate amount, but not too much because there was a lot of liquid in that kettle.
[14:56.900 --> 14:57.480]  It's a big kettle.
[14:58.460 --> 14:59.420]  The real dilemma.
[14:59.760 --> 15:02.080]  You're fucking caught up on the wrong details.
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.840]  I almost burnt the kitchen down and then I'm just trying to pour my ramen, just have a
[15:06.840 --> 15:08.240]  nice little evening treat.
[15:08.940 --> 15:11.660]  And I can't even speak.
[15:11.880 --> 15:12.880]  It latches onto the bowl.
[15:12.980 --> 15:18.720]  So by the looks of it, judging by the top image, there are two metal latches.
[15:18.940 --> 15:19.200]  Yes.
[15:19.720 --> 15:21.640]  So did they swing up over a lid?
[15:21.760 --> 15:22.460]  They swing up, yep.
[15:22.660 --> 15:25.100]  And then you would hold them both together as your handle.
[15:25.760 --> 15:26.440]  Yes, absolutely.
[15:26.440 --> 15:28.020]  That is how it works.
[15:28.160 --> 15:29.020]  Right, okay.
[15:29.580 --> 15:34.340]  And then that weird, that handle off the side is the spout, I guess.
[15:34.680 --> 15:36.780]  Yes, the thing to the left that extends out.
[15:36.900 --> 15:37.500]  That is the same.
[15:37.580 --> 15:38.360]  That is not metal.
[15:38.800 --> 15:40.100]  It's all part of the same thing.
[15:40.220 --> 15:45.800]  At no point with this device are you ever expected to decant out the side while it's
[15:45.800 --> 15:46.000]  hot.
[15:46.260 --> 15:48.240]  No, it is not designed for that.
[15:48.320 --> 15:49.460]  It's not designed for ramen.
[15:49.600 --> 15:50.560]  I mean, we went over this.
[15:50.680 --> 15:53.940]  It was just a used best thing available and it got latched on.
[15:54.020 --> 15:54.860]  I didn't know what to do.
[15:54.860 --> 15:56.420]  Because I couldn't push it forward.
[15:56.680 --> 16:01.040]  I couldn't pull the handle off of it, off the back, because it went down and under and over.
[16:01.700 --> 16:06.300]  If you listen to this, you truly need to go and find the image on our Instagram.
[16:06.300 --> 16:07.660]  We will make sure we get the images up.
[16:07.700 --> 16:10.180]  Because I don't know how I would have described...
[16:10.180 --> 16:12.320]  It's not what you're thinking of if you're picturing a kettle.
[16:12.820 --> 16:18.460]  I promise you, this is not a situation where you can take what Andrew said and draw his room
[16:18.460 --> 16:18.980]  from it.
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.440]  You will not get to the kettle bowl situation that you've got in front of you.
[16:22.460 --> 16:23.180]  Standard handles.
[16:23.180 --> 16:27.280]  A part of the kettle is swung down and mated with the underside of the bowl.
[16:27.860 --> 16:30.740]  And it appears to be like a nice ceramic bowl.
[16:31.060 --> 16:32.880]  I also like the fact that you've got yourself a drink.
[16:33.040 --> 16:34.280]  You're like, I'm in this for the long run.
[16:34.640 --> 16:35.940]  Is that butter next to it?
[16:35.940 --> 16:36.360]  It's butter.
[16:36.640 --> 16:37.520]  It's what's left of butter.
[16:37.540 --> 16:38.940]  That's just what was on the counter.
[16:39.120 --> 16:40.380]  That is unrelated to you.
[16:40.800 --> 16:42.340]  I did not butter my ramen.
[16:42.600 --> 16:42.780]  Okay.
[16:42.840 --> 16:43.920]  Yeah, I had my water.
[16:44.100 --> 16:45.420]  I was going to just have a nice...
[16:45.420 --> 16:47.800]  What flavor is this ramen?
[16:48.020 --> 16:49.600]  It's a chicken ramen, Geoff.
[16:49.620 --> 16:50.540]  That's a great question.
[16:50.620 --> 16:51.220]  We're going to pivot.
[16:51.220 --> 16:56.280]  I don't think I've told this story, but the moment it latched on reminded me to one other
[16:56.280 --> 16:57.160]  time in my life.
[16:57.560 --> 17:01.020]  You know, when you were like a kid, I'm going to assume everyone did this and it's not just
[17:01.020 --> 17:02.000]  a weird me thing.
[17:02.120 --> 17:05.600]  You'd have like a cup of water on the table and you'd like try to see if you could make
[17:05.600 --> 17:08.860]  a seal by sucking on it and then like lift the glass off the table.
[17:09.140 --> 17:10.460]  Am I the only one that did this?
[17:11.800 --> 17:13.440]  Any idea what I'm talking about?
[17:13.880 --> 17:14.100]  Continue.
[17:14.580 --> 17:15.320]  I'm just asking.
[17:15.400 --> 17:15.960]  That was a question.
[17:16.080 --> 17:17.100]  If either of you've done this...
[17:17.100 --> 17:18.000]  I've not...
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.740]  I've never tried to blow a glass of water, no.
[17:20.740 --> 17:21.580]  Not blow.
[17:21.760 --> 17:22.480]  You suck.
[17:22.920 --> 17:23.660]  It's a sucking thing.
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.420]  It's not a blowing thing.
[17:24.920 --> 17:26.320]  But what's the goal of it?
[17:26.620 --> 17:27.900]  Well, it's just to like create...
[17:27.900 --> 17:28.140]  I don't know.
[17:28.160 --> 17:28.940]  It's like a dumb...
[17:28.940 --> 17:29.520]  I'm a kid.
[17:29.640 --> 17:30.680]  This is going to be goofy.
[17:30.920 --> 17:33.280]  I'm lifting a glass of water without using my hands.
[17:33.360 --> 17:36.020]  Like I'll create a seal by sucking onto the top of it.
[17:36.380 --> 17:39.000]  It'll form around my mouth and then I can lift the glass up.
[17:39.260 --> 17:40.440]  I think I've done that.
[17:40.620 --> 17:41.500]  You think you've done it.
[17:41.600 --> 17:44.160]  I feel like that's not like the craziest of kid things.
[17:44.440 --> 17:45.200]  But with glass?
[17:45.680 --> 17:47.260]  Yeah, well, maybe like a cup.
[17:47.300 --> 17:48.340]  It doesn't have to be a glass.
[17:48.340 --> 17:49.740]  It's just what came to mind.
[17:49.740 --> 17:54.420]  Just elevating, using suction to lift something like a drinking thing off the table.
[17:55.360 --> 17:56.480]  When I was...
[17:56.480 --> 18:00.280]  I'm going to say 14, maybe 13, 14 in that range.
[18:00.840 --> 18:01.680]  It was 2 a.m.
[18:02.380 --> 18:04.160]  And you know Voss water?
[18:04.420 --> 18:05.920]  And they have like those giant caps.
[18:06.300 --> 18:07.540]  I don't know if you're familiar with Voss.
[18:07.700 --> 18:09.400]  But they have massive...
[18:09.400 --> 18:11.520]  Yeah, they have massive silver bottle caps.
[18:11.580 --> 18:14.840]  And I had one on my desk and it was 3 a.m.
[18:14.960 --> 18:18.840]  And I thought about being a kid and creating that seal and like sucking it up.
[18:18.840 --> 18:22.340]  I was like, ah, I'm going to suck up this bottle cap and just lift it without my hands.
[18:22.720 --> 18:23.940]  The dumb 3 a.m. idea.
[18:24.560 --> 18:25.440]  I sucked it in.
[18:25.600 --> 18:30.300]  It slid from my upper lip down and locked onto my lower jaw.
[18:30.420 --> 18:32.540]  Like it looped around my chin perfectly.
[18:33.040 --> 18:35.340]  It was the exact...
[18:35.340 --> 18:38.320]  It's the most secured clamp I've ever experienced.
[18:38.520 --> 18:41.480]  And that's what it felt like when the kettle...
[18:42.260 --> 18:45.700]  It fell securely and attached to your chin.
[18:45.700 --> 18:49.380]  It attached to my chin and it hurt like a motherfucker.
[18:49.520 --> 18:50.540]  It was so bad.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.560]  It was like just the worst pain.
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.680]  I struggled to remove it from my chin.
[18:55.140 --> 18:56.360]  I eventually did.
[18:56.440 --> 18:57.900]  It took like probably two minutes.
[18:57.980 --> 18:58.660]  I got it off.
[18:58.900 --> 18:59.900]  It's like, that was stupid.
[18:59.980 --> 19:01.040]  I'm never going to do that again.
[19:01.100 --> 19:01.880]  What a dumb thing.
[19:01.980 --> 19:02.540]  I went to bed.
[19:02.620 --> 19:03.120]  I wake up.
[19:03.540 --> 19:04.280]  Go into my kitchen.
[19:04.440 --> 19:06.420]  My mom says, why do you have dirt on your face?
[19:06.820 --> 19:07.480]  I was like, what do you mean?
[19:07.520 --> 19:08.580]  I don't have dirt on my face.
[19:08.920 --> 19:09.920]  She's like, get over here.
[19:09.980 --> 19:12.440]  She tried to like clean the dirt.
[19:12.440 --> 19:17.420]  I gave myself two giant hickeys that were like goatees.
[19:19.660 --> 19:21.300]  It sealed so tightly.
[19:21.800 --> 19:24.900]  The lid gave me hickeys down like my left and right side.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.640]  It was truly like a hickey goatee.
[19:27.180 --> 19:28.860]  Well, how did you get multiples?
[19:29.140 --> 19:29.640]  Did it like suck on the way down?
[19:29.640 --> 19:31.120]  Well, because it clamped on both sides.
[19:31.240 --> 19:32.500]  Yeah, it clamped on both sides.
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.060]  Like it was a circular cap.
[19:34.200 --> 19:35.700]  It clamped on both sides.
[19:35.780 --> 19:39.820]  And I had equal goatee hickeys down the left and right side of my chin.
[19:40.280 --> 19:41.600]  It was so embarrassing.
[19:41.600 --> 19:43.780]  I didn't know how to lie about that injury.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.980]  If somebody brought it up, I'd be like, I fell into offense.
[19:47.140 --> 19:48.160]  Like I didn't know what to say.
[19:48.300 --> 19:53.060]  Like I didn't want to say that I gave myself hickeys by sucking on a bottle cap by accident.
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.560]  It's a dumb thing.
[19:54.740 --> 19:57.480]  But as soon as that fucking kettle locked onto that bowl,
[19:57.580 --> 19:59.680]  that's immediately what I thought of was that bottle cap.
[19:59.760 --> 20:01.040]  Because I was like, I'm fucked.
[20:01.180 --> 20:01.900]  How do I do this?
[20:02.040 --> 20:02.960]  This bowl is going to get a hickey.
[20:03.340 --> 20:05.680]  This bowl is going to get two massive goatee hickeys.
[20:06.180 --> 20:07.120]  I cannot have this.
[20:07.180 --> 20:08.060]  This is a great bowl.
[20:08.560 --> 20:10.880]  So eventually I decided this is what I'm going to do.
[20:10.880 --> 20:13.380]  I need to tilt everything to its side.
[20:13.500 --> 20:15.740]  That's the only way to get this bowl out of here.
[20:15.800 --> 20:19.540]  But to do that, I need to obviously get it underneath a pot.
[20:20.060 --> 20:23.760]  Why didn't you just drag the bar back towards the kettle?
[20:23.800 --> 20:24.320]  I couldn't.
[20:24.380 --> 20:25.180]  It would not let me.
[20:26.280 --> 20:30.760]  Do you see how the width of it went beyond what the...
[20:30.760 --> 20:35.180]  Yes, the lip of the bowl was further out than what the metal thing would let me pull.
[20:35.440 --> 20:37.100]  I could not reverse the pull.
[20:37.580 --> 20:39.160]  It was latched on and there's nothing...
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.780]  The only way I could get it out is if I lifted it and pulled it up and over the kettle.
[20:44.520 --> 20:45.580]  So I got a bowl.
[20:45.940 --> 20:48.220]  I'm like, I'm just going to pour everything into this pot.
[20:48.840 --> 20:49.800]  And we're fine.
[20:49.920 --> 20:52.840]  And I'll just pour from the pot into another bowl.
[20:53.220 --> 20:54.960]  The other handle swings over.
[20:55.100 --> 20:56.100]  Mates to that one too.
[20:58.160 --> 21:02.260]  So what happens is I lift the kettle and I start moving the bowl.
[21:02.420 --> 21:03.920]  And then this happens immediately.
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.760]  Oh, the bowl instantly shat.
[21:08.820 --> 21:10.540]  That's how tight the clamp was.
[21:10.680 --> 21:14.780]  Like, as soon as I moved it a slight bit, the bowl shatters in half.
[21:15.240 --> 21:17.160]  My broth leaks out onto the counter.
[21:17.360 --> 21:23.880]  And I just watch sad as it goes over the side, hits the floor and is just done.
[21:23.980 --> 21:24.700]  So then I panic.
[21:24.780 --> 21:25.640]  I grab napkins.
[21:25.820 --> 21:26.520]  I clean it up.
[21:26.640 --> 21:27.620]  And that was my ramen.
[21:27.700 --> 21:28.480]  I was trying to make ramen.
[21:28.580 --> 21:29.120]  I broke the bowl.
[21:29.440 --> 21:31.820]  That looks like a bowl that's been in your family for years.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.240]  It's an old bowl.
[21:33.600 --> 21:34.340]  Yeah, I don't know.
[21:34.420 --> 21:35.700]  I don't think it's valuable or anything.
[21:35.880 --> 21:36.860]  It's just it's a nice bowl.
[21:37.180 --> 21:38.620]  Did you get in trouble for breaking it?
[21:38.880 --> 21:40.400]  No, it's just my bowl.
[21:41.300 --> 21:42.040]  Dude, I'm sorry.
[21:42.160 --> 21:43.240]  I'm sorry you lost a bowl.
[21:43.360 --> 21:43.920]  Did you know?
[21:44.040 --> 21:44.840]  Let me ask you a question.
[21:45.140 --> 21:47.420]  Were you able to salvage any of that ramen or did you?
[21:47.560 --> 21:48.240]  Oh, I ate all over.
[21:48.360 --> 21:50.000]  I ate all the ramen, but it was brothless.
[21:50.180 --> 21:51.460]  It was a it was a sad.
[21:51.520 --> 21:52.120]  It wasn't great.
[21:52.380 --> 21:53.540]  It was a bad ramen experience.
[21:53.760 --> 21:56.160]  Did you get any fun ceramic chunks?
[21:56.520 --> 21:58.020]  It broke so cleanly.
[21:58.280 --> 21:59.460]  It's in three pieces.
[21:59.980 --> 22:00.700]  It was a clean break.
[22:01.140 --> 22:02.260]  Like, it's easy to fix.
[22:02.260 --> 22:04.200]  I'm going to try to glue it back together.
[22:04.440 --> 22:05.560]  I just haven't done it yet.
[22:05.720 --> 22:08.460]  If that's if that's a part missing, it probably means someone's trying to kill you there.
[22:10.940 --> 22:11.300]  What?
[22:11.940 --> 22:12.820]  Let me ask you a question.
[22:12.940 --> 22:13.980]  What did you like?
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Did you glean any insights from this experience?
[22:16.100 --> 22:17.620]  Is there anything that you've decided to take?
[22:17.800 --> 22:18.440]  I'm not going to.
[22:18.620 --> 22:20.820]  I'm not going to cook ramen in a kettle going forward.
[22:20.820 --> 22:22.420]  You shouldn't do anything with that kettle.
[22:22.500 --> 22:23.580]  You should bin that thing.
[22:23.800 --> 22:24.860]  No, it's a great kettle.
[22:25.260 --> 22:26.140]  It's a great kettle.
[22:26.140 --> 22:26.220]  What do you mean?
[22:26.660 --> 22:27.900]  It's a fantastic kettle.
[22:28.320 --> 22:29.280]  Tell that to the bowl.
[22:29.800 --> 22:30.160]  It's a great...
[22:31.220 --> 22:32.640]  The bowl is my fault.
[22:32.840 --> 22:34.320]  I put the bowl of that position.
[22:34.520 --> 22:35.980]  I put the angle where it was.
[22:36.200 --> 22:38.860]  Why not get a kettle with a spout that has just had a lid on it?
[22:39.080 --> 22:43.180]  It's like that scene in 127 hours when it locked, you know,
[22:43.260 --> 22:45.100]  where like the boulder is on the guy's hand.
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.480]  He's just like, this is my life.
[22:46.580 --> 22:46.980]  I can't.
[22:47.140 --> 22:47.840]  Wow, that happened.
[22:47.960 --> 22:49.160]  That was the that was the click.
[22:49.340 --> 22:52.580]  Once it clicked on as like this, I can't reverse this.
[22:53.060 --> 22:54.440]  We got to deal with this somehow.
[22:57.160 --> 22:59.900]  I'll be surprised if that's ever happened to anyone else.
[23:02.860 --> 23:05.840]  It was just like the most absurd, chaotic.
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.440]  I almost set the kitchen on fire that I broke a bowl using a kettle because the handle.
[23:10.860 --> 23:14.940]  You should sue the kettle company because this is how warnings get on ladders.
[23:15.260 --> 23:19.900]  You the end result could be you could be a warning on all kettles going forward.
[23:20.220 --> 23:20.960]  It could be your legacy.
[23:21.380 --> 23:24.780]  I'm going to try and find a stovetop kettle.
[23:25.280 --> 23:26.460]  I wish I knew the name of it.
[23:26.660 --> 23:27.580]  Try to find his kettle.
[23:27.580 --> 23:29.000]  Oh, my God.
[23:29.300 --> 23:30.980]  What are the first things?
[23:31.480 --> 23:32.020]  Is it my kettle?
[23:32.420 --> 23:35.000]  Is it like a hook over lidded kettle?
[23:35.480 --> 23:37.440]  Oh, I've never I can't believe I've never seen.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.880]  Maybe they're more common than I thought.
[23:39.360 --> 23:39.880]  But put a link in.
[23:39.920 --> 23:40.260]  I want to see.
[23:40.600 --> 23:42.360]  I think that actually might be the same kettle.
[23:42.760 --> 23:45.400]  Well, it's not the same, but that has a complete spout.
[23:45.520 --> 23:47.060]  It's not like a half spout.
[23:47.160 --> 23:48.240]  No, that's a half spout.
[23:48.400 --> 23:50.160]  That's that's it looks like the top comes off.
[23:50.340 --> 23:50.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:50.920 --> 23:53.340]  Oh, so the other half of the spout is on the lid.
[23:53.340 --> 23:54.820]  Yeah, the other.
[23:55.140 --> 23:55.320]  Yeah.
[23:55.860 --> 23:57.680]  The lid completes the spout as mix.
[23:57.840 --> 23:58.800]  I'm looking at it.
[23:58.880 --> 24:01.260]  I'm I think it it seems it's weird.
[24:01.880 --> 24:06.400]  It seems like a functional tea kettle would not probably try to make anything other than tea in it.
[24:06.640 --> 24:08.040]  Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[24:08.320 --> 24:10.300]  Oh, there's like a dangly tea container.
[24:10.700 --> 24:10.980]  Yeah.
[24:11.080 --> 24:12.960]  Does yours have the dangly tea container in it?
[24:13.240 --> 24:14.700]  Uh, no, I don't think it does.
[24:15.340 --> 24:18.080]  I'm not seeing any warning to not cook ramen in there.
[24:19.240 --> 24:20.800]  That's a $200 kettle.
[24:21.280 --> 24:22.020]  It's a fancy kettle.
[24:22.280 --> 24:22.820]  It's a nice kettle.
[24:23.340 --> 24:24.020]  Was yours similar?
[24:24.420 --> 24:27.920]  It is similar. I don't think it's that exact one, but it's it's a similar idea.
[24:28.260 --> 24:30.460]  Wow. Well, I feel I feel dumb then.
[24:30.840 --> 24:32.760]  I guess I've never just I've just never seen that style.
[24:33.020 --> 24:35.280]  Interesting kettle flex there.
[24:35.960 --> 24:38.880]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I got a flex where I can't Geoff.
[24:39.280 --> 24:40.920]  I got sushi containers on the floor.
[24:41.160 --> 24:42.700]  I got to have like I got to have something.
[24:43.160 --> 24:44.400]  That bowl flexed real nice.
[24:47.240 --> 24:48.680]  The bowl completely shattered.
[24:49.700 --> 24:52.980]  I love any story of pictures in your kitchen.
[24:52.980 --> 24:53.720]  That way.
[25:01.240 --> 25:04.240]  Summer is here and the living ain't easy.
[25:04.280 --> 25:09.140]  If you've got swamp ass, how will you stay on top of your sweaty bottom?
[25:09.540 --> 25:12.880]  Why try a refreshing spray from a Hello Tushy bidet.
[25:13.300 --> 25:15.540]  Keep your sweaty crack clean all summer long.
[25:15.600 --> 25:16.800]  They write this stuff, not me.
[25:16.860 --> 25:20.640]  With the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0 modern bidet attachment.
[25:20.940 --> 25:21.680]  It is stylish.
[25:21.820 --> 25:25.720]  It is eco-friendly and it's a refreshing little shower for your butthole.
[25:25.720 --> 25:30.720]  The Hello Tushy 3.0 cleans soggy butts like a champ, but it doesn't stop there.
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.260]  It cleans itself with the Smart Spray Automatic Self-Cleaning Nozzle.
[25:35.340 --> 25:36.480]  This thing loves to clean.
[25:36.580 --> 25:37.560]  It cleans you, it cleans it.
[25:37.640 --> 25:40.500]  It's like, God, I wish I could get it to clean my oven, honestly.
[25:41.060 --> 25:43.820]  I wonder if I installed a toilet facing...
[25:43.820 --> 25:45.620]  Well, we'll look into that.
[25:46.060 --> 25:48.800]  No one wants to work up a sweat in 100 degree heat.
[25:48.860 --> 25:52.980]  And if you live like I do in Texas, it's 100 degrees 300 days a year.
[25:52.980 --> 25:57.580]  That's why the Hello Tushy bidet attaches to your existing toilet with no electricity
[25:57.580 --> 25:59.000]  or extra plumbing needed.
[25:59.520 --> 26:01.780]  And Hello Tushy cuts toilet paper use by 80%,
[26:02.360 --> 26:06.680]  so it'll pay for itself in a few months and all of those ints will thank you.
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.940]  Plus, Hello Tushy's got your ass covered with a 60-day risk-free guarantee
[26:10.940 --> 26:13.020]  and a 12-month warranty.
[26:13.580 --> 26:17.260]  If you've already got a Hello Tushy, why not upgrade to the 3.0 model?
[26:17.600 --> 26:18.600]  Defeat swamp ass.
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.280]  Go to hellotushy.com slash face to get 10% off plus free shipping.
[26:23.660 --> 26:29.640]  This is a special offer for our listeners at hellotushy.com slash face for 10% off.
[26:29.920 --> 26:31.960]  hellotushy.com slash face.
[26:32.160 --> 26:36.360]  We all take little risks every day when we go online, whether we think about it or not.
[26:36.600 --> 26:39.640]  We think our connection probably won't be interrupted by hackers.
[26:39.900 --> 26:42.920]  Our data probably won't be used against us.
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.440]  All of my, uh, I don't know, uh, collectible spoon and thimble browsing
[26:47.440 --> 26:53.320]  probably won't fall into the evil cabal of, uh, uh, ceramic, uh,
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.940]  militant anti-spoon and thimble, uh, aficionados.
[26:58.520 --> 27:04.020]  But using the internet without ExpressVPN, why, that's like driving your car without insurance.
[27:04.260 --> 27:05.680]  Why take the risk?
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.460]  Every time you connect to an unencrypted network, cafes, hotels, airports,
[27:10.460 --> 27:15.340]  all the places that you go, any hacker on the same network can gain access to your personal data,
[27:15.620 --> 27:21.300]  whether it's your passwords, your financial details, uh, all your save files in Angry Birds.
[27:21.480 --> 27:24.700]  I don't know, but it doesn't take much technical knowledge to hack somebody.
[27:24.940 --> 27:25.980]  Just some cheap hardware.
[27:26.280 --> 27:27.360]  A smart 12-year-old could do it.
[27:27.500 --> 27:30.820]  A average intelligence 12-year-old could probably do it.
[27:31.020 --> 27:34.240]  And your data is valuable, whether you realize it or not.
[27:34.400 --> 27:39.280]  Hackers can make up to $1,000 per person just selling personal info on the dark web.
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.300]  ExpressVPN acts as an online insurance for you.
[27:42.620 --> 27:46.460]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet
[27:46.460 --> 27:51.360]  so the hackers can't steal your personal data like your spoon shopping habits.
[27:51.620 --> 27:55.260]  It would take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years
[27:55.260 --> 28:02.560]  to get past ExpressVPN's encryption and then into the, uh, into the, the, the nether reaches,
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.400]  the, the dark areas of your computer where you hide all of your, your, your thimble collections,
[28:07.400 --> 28:09.080]  uh, ceramic or metal.
[28:09.580 --> 28:12.620]  And ExpressVPN is simple to use on all of your devices.
[28:12.780 --> 28:15.920]  Just fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[28:16.380 --> 28:20.920]  Secure your online data today by visiting ExpressVPN.com slash face.
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.500]  That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com slash face.
[28:26.640 --> 28:28.680]  And you can get an extra three months free.
[28:29.080 --> 28:31.800]  ExpressVPN.com slash face.
[28:33.220 --> 28:34.420]  It was a time.
[28:34.620 --> 28:35.660]  What about you guys?
[28:35.720 --> 28:37.200]  How, how are, how's life?
[28:37.200 --> 28:42.700]  I think you should be looking for larger signs, larger meanings in these things that are
[28:42.700 --> 28:44.080]  happening, these minor inconveniences.
[28:44.620 --> 28:47.580]  For example, I'll, I'll, I'll tell you how my day started out.
[28:48.100 --> 28:51.060]  Yeah, well, yesterday, uh, I, I need some tree work done, right?
[28:51.340 --> 28:54.380]  Um, need, need to have some, some canopies lifted.
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.900]  I have a dead tree and the two, two trees that died from the great freeze that I had to have
[28:58.900 --> 28:59.300]  cut down.
[28:59.500 --> 29:05.640]  So I had, uh, had some fellows come out yesterday to do some tree work because I don't schedule
[29:05.640 --> 29:11.700]  things on Tuesdays and Thursdays because those are the days that I record Annual Pass and, uh,
[29:11.700 --> 29:12.880]  this podcast currently.
[29:13.920 --> 29:20.520]  And, uh, so I try to avoid anything, any people in and around my house those days.
[29:20.580 --> 29:23.940]  I need not only quiet so that I can record because I'm recording at home, but I also,
[29:24.380 --> 29:27.600]  to be honest with you, uh, it takes a little bit of preparation to get ready to record
[29:27.600 --> 29:28.180]  podcasts.
[29:28.720 --> 29:31.900]  And so it's nice to have a little bit of, uh, time to gather my thoughts, you know?
[29:31.900 --> 29:33.680]  Uh, so Wednesday was yesterday.
[29:33.860 --> 29:37.360]  I had some fellows come out to look at doing some tree work and I thought they were going
[29:37.360 --> 29:37.780]  to do it then.
[29:37.840 --> 29:38.280]  They did not.
[29:38.420 --> 29:39.480]  They said, well, we'll give you a quote.
[29:39.540 --> 29:40.260]  It's going to be this much.
[29:40.700 --> 29:41.960]  We said, okay, cool.
[29:42.340 --> 29:43.160]  When will you do it?
[29:43.160 --> 29:44.420]  And they said, it'll be a couple of days.
[29:44.460 --> 29:47.620]  We'll call, we'll, we'll call you, uh, and get you on the schedule, right?
[29:47.660 --> 29:48.340]  And get you on the books.
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.240]  I'm just like, no problem.
[29:49.600 --> 29:50.660]  This morning I got up.
[29:50.760 --> 29:51.520]  Emily went to work.
[29:51.560 --> 29:54.520]  I had a coffee with minor league fan Jack this morning.
[29:55.420 --> 29:59.820]  And, uh, so I left my house at 845 or so to go see minor league.
[29:59.820 --> 30:07.680]  Came home at 10 to, uh, what appeared to be like 12 dudes in various trees around my house
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.860]  with chainsaws, just going fucking ham all over my yard, which is super appreciated.
[30:13.060 --> 30:14.320]  You know, I wanted to get the work done.
[30:14.420 --> 30:16.020]  Would have appreciated a heads up.
[30:16.120 --> 30:20.900]  Probably would have told him not today because I need to record an audio podcast.
[30:21.400 --> 30:25.440]  There, there were, if there was, if there was, was one chainsaw, there were 20.
[30:25.680 --> 30:27.680]  There were, I saw at least four chainsaws going.
[30:27.920 --> 30:28.620]  It was very loud.
[30:28.620 --> 30:31.220]  So, uh, I was like, I look at my watch.
[30:31.300 --> 30:33.940]  I'm like, well, shit, uh, I got three hours.
[30:34.040 --> 30:34.660]  Maybe there'll be done.
[30:34.980 --> 30:39.760]  And then, uh, I, you know, went about my life, proceeded to, uh, get ready for the podcast
[30:39.760 --> 30:41.840]  as much as I can amongst all the noise.
[30:41.960 --> 30:45.160]  Super appreciate that they're doing the work, doing great work.
[30:45.460 --> 30:50.800]  As we get closer to the podcast, I have a, I have an arrow in her crate because I have
[30:50.800 --> 30:51.980]  to leave the door open for her.
[30:52.280 --> 30:56.620]  Otherwise, you know, if she encounters one ounce of resistance, she will just piss and
[30:56.620 --> 30:58.280]  shit immediately where she is.
[30:58.280 --> 31:00.420]  So I have to, I have her in the crate.
[31:00.520 --> 31:05.200]  She's napping, uh, and I'm getting ready for the podcast about 15 minutes before the podcast
[31:05.660 --> 31:05.980]  starts.
[31:06.060 --> 31:06.940]  The last one we recorded.
[31:07.200 --> 31:09.420]  I've given up on the idea that there won't be chainsaws.
[31:09.500 --> 31:10.900]  I'm just hoping that y'all don't hear them.
[31:11.480 --> 31:15.620]  Judged by the fact that, uh, I haven't heard from you guys complain.
[31:15.740 --> 31:17.380]  I don't think that you did at any point.
[31:17.400 --> 31:17.900]  I didn't hear anything.
[31:18.580 --> 31:22.600]  You also didn't notice when I got up in the middle of a podcast and left to go tour the
[31:22.600 --> 31:23.760]  yard and give the guy a check.
[31:23.760 --> 31:25.620]  But all that happened while we were recording as well.
[31:25.980 --> 31:26.700]  In this one?
[31:27.260 --> 31:28.320]  Uh, the last episode.
[31:28.420 --> 31:28.500]  Yeah.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.840]  And, uh, why?
[31:32.040 --> 31:34.280]  Because the guy rang my doorbell and I had to go talk to him.
[31:35.220 --> 31:36.220]  Made me say that though.
[31:36.260 --> 31:36.980]  We could have just stopped.
[31:37.360 --> 31:38.140]  What were we talking about?
[31:38.140 --> 31:38.660]  I cover it.
[31:39.140 --> 31:39.880]  Don't worry about it.
[31:39.920 --> 31:40.980]  Say it'd be a fun game for the audience.
[31:41.060 --> 31:43.880]  If you can go back in time and figure out when I was paying a bill.
[31:44.440 --> 31:51.280]  Uh, anyway, so, uh, about at about, so we record a one today at about 1245.
[31:51.760 --> 31:54.560]  I realized we're still doing, uh, it.
[31:54.560 --> 31:59.740]  And, uh, it actually wasn't, it might have overlapped with the discord disconnect, but
[31:59.740 --> 32:01.280]  it wasn't had nothing to do with it.
[32:01.340 --> 32:03.260]  So I'm answering Nick in the chat.
[32:03.840 --> 32:06.040]  Uh, so it's 15 minutes to go.
[32:06.140 --> 32:06.840]  We're about to record.
[32:07.140 --> 32:11.100]  I'm trying to figure out how the fuck I'm going to communicate with you two when I'm,
[32:11.140 --> 32:14.400]  uh, so disappointed in you both, uh, in the moment.
[32:14.580 --> 32:18.560]  And, uh, trying to collect my thoughts, listening to the chainsaw, realizing that that's, that's
[32:18.560 --> 32:20.000]  just, I'm just going to have to deal with that.
[32:20.080 --> 32:23.120]  There's no way that the universe is going to let me off the hook on the chainsaw stuff.
[32:23.120 --> 32:28.380]  Uh, anyway, and then Arrow barks once I hear her go, I go, all right.
[32:28.680 --> 32:30.280]  She probably wants to get out and go to the bathroom.
[32:30.440 --> 32:33.780]  I can't really let the door open though, because there's dudes outside of chainsaws and it
[32:33.780 --> 32:36.540]  would scare Henry and it might scare Arrow, you know?
[32:36.600 --> 32:38.740]  And so, but I get up to go check on her.
[32:39.020 --> 32:42.940]  And as I, uh, and by the way, this, I'm already, you guys, I already have discord open.
[32:42.980 --> 32:44.120]  I'm about to join the chat room.
[32:44.140 --> 32:45.000]  I see you guys in there.
[32:45.400 --> 32:46.900]  Uh, and I, and Arrow barks once.
[32:46.900 --> 32:52.420]  So I go into the, into the laundry room and she's standing in her crate, pissing all over
[32:52.420 --> 32:52.600]  it.
[32:52.940 --> 32:56.140]  And I go, wow, that was the one bark notice I got.
[32:56.220 --> 32:56.420]  Great.
[32:56.680 --> 32:57.760]  So I opened the crate up.
[32:58.020 --> 33:00.360]  Uh, and of course the underside of her is covered in piss.
[33:00.420 --> 33:02.580]  And of course all of her bedding is covered in piss.
[33:02.940 --> 33:08.220]  So I take her out and I give her a little quick bath in the, in the hallway there.
[33:08.300 --> 33:12.060]  I still can't, you know, still not going outside because of all the chainsaws and stuff.
[33:12.180 --> 33:16.440]  And, and so I get, I wet some towels down and I scrub her clean and I get her nice and
[33:16.440 --> 33:18.140]  clean and I think, well, at least she's peed now.
[33:18.260 --> 33:22.340]  So, uh, I don't have to worry about her having, you know, barking while I'm doing the podcast
[33:22.340 --> 33:22.740]  or whatever.
[33:23.960 --> 33:28.340]  And, uh, then I take her bedding and I take the, all the bedding out of her crate and
[33:28.340 --> 33:29.160]  I start washing it.
[33:29.240 --> 33:34.020]  And then I scrub the bedding or I scrub the bottom of the crate, uh, because there's
[33:34.020 --> 33:35.740]  a little bit of pee there and get it all cleaned up.
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.180]  And then I stand up and I look and I'm like, oh, I have like seven minutes.
[33:39.400 --> 33:40.460]  I did it pretty fast.
[33:40.560 --> 33:41.580]  I'm feeling pretty good about that.
[33:41.780 --> 33:46.240]  I turn around to see a line of, uh, dog shit across my house.
[33:47.900 --> 33:49.320]  Uh, she didn't just have to pee.
[33:49.420 --> 33:50.060]  She had to shit.
[33:50.140 --> 33:52.100]  And you know, Arrow doesn't like to shit all at once.
[33:52.100 --> 33:54.420]  She likes to make a journey out of it.
[33:54.420 --> 33:58.480]  Uh, like, uh, maybe it's breadcrumbs so she can find her way back to the original turd.
[33:58.560 --> 33:58.960]  I don't know.
[33:59.320 --> 34:05.180]  But, uh, so then I had to, uh, clean a rug and clean up four piles of dog shit, all
[34:05.180 --> 34:10.800]  then to race back in and sit down with one minute to go to start the podcast with you
[34:10.800 --> 34:11.780]  lovely people.
[34:12.180 --> 34:15.880]  And I got to thinking why I was telling you, Andrew, you should look for larger meanings
[34:15.880 --> 34:16.200]  in life.
[34:16.200 --> 34:22.720]  I realize that this is my fault because I, I got on my high horse and I, I said, I understand
[34:22.720 --> 34:27.020]  that my place in the universe is on a level that is par with shit.
[34:27.420 --> 34:29.720]  But that, that was where I, I misspoke.
[34:29.940 --> 34:31.540]  I misread the tea leaves.
[34:31.700 --> 34:35.300]  What the message was is I'm not on a level as, as shit.
[34:35.380 --> 34:37.100]  I am one level below shit.
[34:37.380 --> 34:44.780]  So I apologize to the universe for, for attempting to say that I am of the level of feces.
[34:44.780 --> 34:49.320]  I recognize that I am, I'm more like the universe's doormat.
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.100]  And I'm the thing that like you guys, when you go into your house and you don't want
[34:53.100 --> 34:56.540]  to bring shit into your home or into your lives, you'd like to leave the shit outside.
[34:56.820 --> 35:00.520]  So you wipe your shoes off the mud and the shit, you wipe it off on a door.
[35:00.540 --> 35:06.440]  I am the universe's shitty doormat, uh, is, uh, is, uh, what I've gleaned from, uh, well,
[35:06.520 --> 35:08.020]  46 years, but certainly from today.
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.240]  And so I was, I would say to you, Andrew, maybe, maybe look for, the universe might
[35:12.240 --> 35:14.280]  be telling you something, uh, in that kettle story.
[35:14.280 --> 35:16.060]  That's hmm.
[35:16.440 --> 35:19.080]  I'll have to analyze what it is telling me.
[35:19.740 --> 35:24.800]  I do have, it's an unrelated update, but I feel like I need to offer you an official
[35:24.800 --> 35:25.640]  apology, Geoff.
[35:26.100 --> 35:26.720]  About what?
[35:27.060 --> 35:29.440]  The universe has spoken in a weird way.
[35:30.120 --> 35:32.400]  We made fun of your, your, your recipe.
[35:33.020 --> 35:38.760]  I don't want to go back to the whole condiment thing, but I just, uh, I just, I just got
[35:38.760 --> 35:39.500]  this notification.
[35:39.960 --> 35:46.940]  A French fry company has responded to my family recipe, which is your recipe, calling it
[35:46.940 --> 35:48.100]  absolutely delicious.
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.560]  Your recipe is approved by a fry company.
[35:52.940 --> 35:55.420]  I feel like it officially is in the condiment thing.
[35:55.540 --> 35:57.600]  I can't argue against the verified fry can.
[35:57.940 --> 36:00.340]  I don't know, but it just happened.
[36:00.700 --> 36:02.260]  Universe works in weird ways.
[36:02.740 --> 36:03.680]  Geoff, I apologize.
[36:04.580 --> 36:06.100]  Yours is absolutely a condiment.
[36:06.100 --> 36:08.500]  Well, apology accepted.
[36:08.740 --> 36:09.440]  Thank you, Andrew.
[36:09.680 --> 36:10.740]  And they do make tots.
[36:11.820 --> 36:11.960]  Yeah.
[36:12.660 --> 36:16.180]  But, uh, I don't think the universe wants me to win any.
[36:16.620 --> 36:18.020]  So, um, you know.
[36:18.100 --> 36:18.820]  I, I don't know.
[36:18.900 --> 36:21.560]  Orada potatoes, they side with you.
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.080]  That's a win.
[36:22.440 --> 36:23.180]  I'd say you got a win.
[36:23.560 --> 36:24.580]  You won a lot of Vegas.
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.000]  You've got some wins.
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.280]  I thought I would go a day without cleaning up shit, but I did not.
[36:30.800 --> 36:31.480]  I did not.
[36:31.760 --> 36:35.160]  Do you have, like, a board in your house at this point of, like, days since I've had to
[36:35.160 --> 36:35.700]  clean shit?
[36:35.700 --> 36:36.720]  You're just constantly.
[36:37.360 --> 36:38.320]  There would be no past one.
[36:38.440 --> 36:41.560]  There would be no just be it'd be extra work to erase it every day.
[36:41.660 --> 36:43.840]  Do they make it like a special shit back?
[36:44.260 --> 36:45.120]  No, I don't know.
[36:45.240 --> 36:46.260]  I don't know.
[36:46.300 --> 36:47.120]  I don't know.
[36:47.480 --> 36:49.600]  Do you have to deal shit in Vegas?
[36:50.100 --> 36:50.640]  Kind of.
[36:50.720 --> 36:51.360]  I was in Vegas.
[36:52.500 --> 36:53.240]  Fair enough.
[36:54.300 --> 36:55.160]  Fair point.
[36:55.360 --> 36:56.760]  Vegas is fucking man.
[36:57.240 --> 36:58.660]  I'm vaccinated and all.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.580]  And yeah, but man, Vegas is a throng of people.
[37:02.980 --> 37:04.440]  We really tested out that back.
[37:04.780 --> 37:05.120]  Yeah.
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.000]  Scary people, man.
[37:07.340 --> 37:08.520]  Vegas scares the shit out of me.
[37:08.660 --> 37:11.340]  Just you always just see crazy stuff.
[37:11.460 --> 37:12.400]  Like I was just behind.
[37:12.940 --> 37:15.480]  I was behind someone I know watching them play roulette.
[37:15.940 --> 37:22.440]  Some guy walks up, drops about five grand on a single number with the only bet.
[37:23.120 --> 37:27.700]  It immediately lands on that number, and he walks away with close to like 200 grand
[37:27.700 --> 37:30.280]  without even changing his facial expression.
[37:30.980 --> 37:32.660]  And I just looked at the person I was with.
[37:32.700 --> 37:34.440]  I was like, what has happened?
[37:34.440 --> 37:36.620]  What just happened right in front of us?
[37:36.880 --> 37:38.320]  And was that normal for that guy?
[37:38.980 --> 37:40.080]  That way it was mental.
[37:40.440 --> 37:41.160]  What's the odds of that?
[37:41.200 --> 37:42.660]  It's like 30 something to one.
[37:42.960 --> 37:44.380]  He's probably like, keep it together.
[37:44.540 --> 37:44.960]  Keep it together.
[37:45.120 --> 37:45.320]  Yeah.
[37:45.340 --> 37:46.540]  You look cool right now.
[37:46.680 --> 37:47.740]  Forget the hotel room.
[37:48.040 --> 37:49.120]  The coolest moment of my life.
[37:49.360 --> 37:54.860]  Because in my opinion, five grand is an obscene amount of money to place on a single bet.
[37:55.260 --> 37:56.360]  That's a heavy loss.
[37:56.560 --> 37:59.200]  But to get like, what is it?
[37:59.240 --> 38:00.400]  Like 180 something back.
[38:00.820 --> 38:01.660]  That's life changing.
[38:02.120 --> 38:02.280]  Yeah.
[38:02.400 --> 38:04.220]  And it just, maybe it just wasn't to him.
[38:04.220 --> 38:07.560]  Maybe it was just like, I'll put it with the others because he does it all the time.
[38:07.900 --> 38:10.700]  We were just so confused as to like, did he know?
[38:10.860 --> 38:11.860]  Like, how could he know?
[38:11.980 --> 38:15.300]  Maybe he was so far in the hole.
[38:15.560 --> 38:16.780]  He's like, well, that's a start.
[38:18.960 --> 38:19.360]  Maybe.
[38:20.880 --> 38:24.080]  I just still to this day, it like the whole experience.
[38:24.460 --> 38:27.580]  It was, you know, slightly amazing, but mostly terrifying.
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.900]  Just how it played out in front of us as if like nothing happened.
[38:31.280 --> 38:33.600]  I just don't want to know anything more about that guy.
[38:34.460 --> 38:37.820]  That's like the fun of most of the fun of Vegas for me,
[38:37.920 --> 38:40.720]  especially now that I don't drink anymore, is just watching people.
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.800]  It's like the best people watching because it's like it's people that are
[38:44.800 --> 38:52.400]  it's cutting loose or, you know, just going wild or are losing money and freaking out or
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.900]  winning money and freaking out or winning money and being very calm and collected.
[38:56.900 --> 38:58.620]  Apparently, that's the first I've heard of that.
[38:59.660 --> 39:01.640]  It's just it's just it's never dull.
[39:01.640 --> 39:05.320]  You know, it's a high risk scenario, though, in Vegas, because like,
[39:05.400 --> 39:08.060]  let's say great people watching is like at a blackjack table.
[39:08.140 --> 39:11.400]  But then you have the pressure of you don't want to be the person fucking up the table.
[39:11.440 --> 39:13.780]  It is. Oh, yeah, the table etiquette.
[39:13.900 --> 39:15.800]  I got called out. I was playing.
[39:16.560 --> 39:20.200]  I was doing like an online casino thing where I was playing blackjack
[39:20.200 --> 39:23.120]  and I got called out there and I felt like a little kid to school.
[39:23.240 --> 39:25.480]  Like even the dealer was like, what are you doing?
[39:25.720 --> 39:28.360]  Stop doing that. And I just like I wanted to hide.
[39:28.600 --> 39:29.960]  You got called out online.
[39:29.960 --> 39:34.000]  I got called out online to somebody else's online etiquette.
[39:34.180 --> 39:36.360]  Well, because I kept splitting tens because I was like,
[39:36.380 --> 39:38.840]  I feel lucky today and you're not supposed to split tens.
[39:38.980 --> 39:42.260]  It's like a low probability unless you're in like a tournament is the only context
[39:42.260 --> 39:46.400]  where you'd want to do that. And I guess it's bad table etiquette.
[39:46.460 --> 39:50.180]  So people people like two people at the table are like,
[39:50.260 --> 39:53.100]  that's the third time you split tens. Why are you doing that?
[39:53.180 --> 39:55.220]  Stop doing that. And then the dealer was like,
[39:55.400 --> 39:59.400]  stop the game was telling me like the math probability of why I shouldn't split.
[39:59.400 --> 40:02.740]  The whole table is mad at me. That's just in my living room.
[40:02.780 --> 40:06.280]  And I felt so embarrassed and like, I'm sorry, I'm just I'm playing.
[40:06.780 --> 40:09.200]  I didn't mean to fuck up your thing. So you like on audio.
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.640]  Like, could you hear each other? Uh, no, I have no audio.
[40:11.880 --> 40:14.520]  Like you, the dealer has audio. Nobody else does.
[40:15.020 --> 40:17.260]  You could text chat if you want to. I never do.
[40:17.460 --> 40:20.180]  I guess I just don't know the I don't know the rules of blackjack.
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.360]  So I don't really understand. Is that the one where you can like
[40:23.360 --> 40:26.360]  wreck the entire game for everyone else by what you by what you're doing?
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.780]  I think there are like certain bad plays and good plays that is standard.
[40:29.900 --> 40:31.560]  I'm not super knowledgeable about blackjack.
[40:31.920 --> 40:34.580]  You're just trying to get as close to 21 without going over it.
[40:34.620 --> 40:38.080]  Yeah, you can't really fuck anybody else over with your bad decisions in blackjack.
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.800]  Yeah, that's what it is. It's craps the one where it's like your moves affect everyone else's.
[40:42.100 --> 40:45.200]  I mean, if you roll shitty. I think you can in black because I think
[40:45.200 --> 40:48.820]  it's dependent on like what card the dealer has. So like you can make
[40:49.620 --> 40:54.660]  bad hits or like stays depending on what. I just don't understand why if it doesn't
[40:54.660 --> 40:56.680]  affect other people at table, why are they annoyed?
[40:56.860 --> 41:02.700]  Well, because because I'm taking cards from the shoot that could potentially harm the dealer
[41:02.700 --> 41:07.060]  and I'm already in an advantageous position, like I'm probably going to win anyway.
[41:07.200 --> 41:09.840]  So I might just be fucking up for everybody else.
[41:10.040 --> 41:14.900]  And I also am already ruining like a near perfect hand to like out of greed, essentially.
[41:15.260 --> 41:20.160]  They're upset. But I stopped playing for like eight months after that because I was so embarrassed.
[41:20.300 --> 41:24.500]  Like it was just like, I don't want the dealer to yell at me. I was just having some fun.
[41:24.500 --> 41:26.560]  Have you done real Vegas in front of real people?
[41:26.940 --> 41:28.880]  I've never done real Vegas in front of real people.
[41:29.100 --> 41:30.900]  When you do, can I be there?
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.420]  Yeah, you and I will be. We're going to be like swingers at like the budget table,
[41:35.600 --> 41:36.380]  just people watching.
[41:37.320 --> 41:41.260]  I think you could be that guy. You could be the guy who walks up to his first table,
[41:41.420 --> 41:44.520]  drops five grand and walks away with hundreds of thousands.
[41:44.880 --> 41:48.780]  I would not be able to contain myself. I could not be the calm. I would blow the moment.
[41:48.920 --> 41:52.660]  I would immediately become extremely uncool in everybody's eyes.
[41:52.660 --> 41:58.840]  It would be very apparent that I was stunned. I'd not be like, this is nothing guy. That couldn't
[41:58.840 --> 41:59.180]  be me.
[41:59.560 --> 42:03.460]  Another weird Vegas experience I had, I got into a, I was with Dan and we got in a lift
[42:03.460 --> 42:09.040]  and some other woman got into a lift too. And her, her purse was like overflowing with chips
[42:09.040 --> 42:12.860]  and she was like spilling them all over the floor, like on the way to the lift. And like she,
[42:13.340 --> 42:15.860]  the door closed and she'd lost some and they were all over the floor of the lift.
[42:16.100 --> 42:20.920]  And we helped her pick them up and they were all like thousand dollar chips.
[42:20.920 --> 42:24.720]  And I was just like, I had like, I had like 10 grand of hers in my hand. I was like,
[42:25.260 --> 42:29.580]  Oh my God, you've, she must've had like 80 grand's worth or something.
[42:30.200 --> 42:33.880]  And I was just like, man, you're rich off the, off this one Vegas trip.
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.600]  Did you encounter the person who robbed the $200,000 guy? Is this like second part of the
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.620]  story? Like you have, you've seen two ends of this thing without realizing it.
[42:42.800 --> 42:46.380]  Just the way she was treating them though was really mind blowing. They looked like
[42:46.380 --> 42:50.720]  they were tens or something, but she was just spilling thousands all over the floor. I was
[42:50.720 --> 42:54.860]  like, you left, you've left probably two or three grand outside the lift downstairs.
[42:55.580 --> 42:59.580]  She was like, yeah, she was really drunk. She's like, yeah, I hope I don't lose anymore.
[42:59.680 --> 43:04.660]  I was like, Oh my God, I was tempted to like go back down after it.
[43:04.820 --> 43:09.340]  What's the fucking, the name of the bear in Spyro that has like the sack of gems? Like,
[43:09.380 --> 43:12.760]  that's just what I'm imagining of this woman with like a sack of poker chips,
[43:13.060 --> 43:15.320]  just leaking out the bottom, being careless.
[43:15.900 --> 43:20.280]  Yeah. We made sure like, we made sure she got to where she was going without dropping
[43:20.280 --> 43:24.920]  anyone because she was all over the place. And I think by the time, I don't think either
[43:24.920 --> 43:28.160]  of us went back down to see if there are any left on the floor, but I assume someone found it.
[43:30.960 --> 43:34.540]  Gavin told me that he has great roulette luck one time.
[43:34.840 --> 43:36.140]  I'm a hundred percent on roulette.
[43:36.300 --> 43:37.360]  Nah, you're not.
[43:37.460 --> 43:41.620]  Are you one for one? Are you like 10 for 10? What's, what is a hundred percent for you?
[43:41.820 --> 43:45.340]  I'm disputing this. Yeah. What is your hundred percent? You made it,
[43:45.740 --> 43:48.880]  in my head, you're like four for four is what it sounds like roughly.
[43:48.880 --> 43:50.140]  Yeah. That's a hundred percent.
[43:50.900 --> 43:53.920]  Cause Bernie, Bernie, uh, you know, the guy we started or started Rooster Teeth with,
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.380]  he likes to brag that he has a perfect field goal kicking record. Cause he's one for one.
[43:59.480 --> 44:04.020]  So like Gavin might have be a hundred percent roulette. Cause he's done played roulette once
[44:04.020 --> 44:04.480]  and won.
[44:04.820 --> 44:08.760]  Yeah. I did. Um, I just, I went on colors cause I don't understand. I, I'm just,
[44:08.900 --> 44:13.200]  I don't understand any gambling really. It's like the simplest stuff. So I just like put up,
[44:13.460 --> 44:18.700]  put a hundred on black, got 200, put 200 on black, got 400, put 400 on red.
[44:18.700 --> 44:21.420]  I think I did it four times and I won four times. And I just thought
[44:21.420 --> 44:23.980]  I'm up on Vegas forever now. If I just walk away.
[44:24.500 --> 44:28.680]  Yeah. The way, the way gambling works for people that don't gamble a lot is essentially you go up
[44:28.680 --> 44:33.260]  to a complete stranger in front of other people and you give them an amount of your money,
[44:33.380 --> 44:38.060]  like a hundred bucks, let's say. And then you say, do something complicated in front of me
[44:38.060 --> 44:43.060]  and then keep that money. And then they do. That's typically, that's typically how it works.
[44:44.060 --> 44:48.140]  And then you go, thank you. Thank you. I don't exactly understand why I don't have my a hundred
[44:48.140 --> 44:52.460]  dollars anymore, but, uh, people around me seem to be having fun. So I guess I am too.
[44:52.940 --> 44:58.400]  Dan was like annoyed by my luck. So he, he then went in, I think on a couple of them,
[44:58.460 --> 45:02.540]  he was betting against me, uh, and he lost twice. And then he was, and then we were like, well,
[45:02.560 --> 45:06.560]  you know, if you, if you put that money in again and you win, uh, it'd be like, uh, nothing ever
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.100]  happened. And he kept doing it. It landed on green twice back to back. He was livid.
[45:12.780 --> 45:19.960]  Oh, that's a great way to lose though. Like that's almost as good as winning. That's better
[45:19.960 --> 45:23.540]  than it just being the other color. I want to lose gloriously. If I'm going to lose.
[45:23.700 --> 45:28.000]  I just hate on roulette on a lot of the tables. There's a screen that shows all the previous
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.840]  results as if that has anything to do with what's going to happen next. It is there to do is poison
[45:33.840 --> 45:38.080]  your mind. Yes. Well, you don't, you don't understand the mind. You are not a gambling
[45:38.080 --> 45:43.800]  man, Gavin. It is. If there is four blacks in a row, it is universally impossible to be black
[45:43.800 --> 45:49.040]  again. It cannot happen. That's how the gambling brain works. You put everything in on red on that
[45:49.040 --> 45:54.440]  play. I don't know how rigged the tables are. Like I assume that they must be in a way. I don't,
[45:54.540 --> 45:57.800]  I wouldn't, I don't think so. I don't think they're rigged at all. I just think the games
[45:57.800 --> 46:06.240]  are so tilted for the rule set. The game, the game is rigged in itself. Yeah. Like you could
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.020]  theoretically count cards to like increase your probability of winning or like making smart bets
[46:11.020 --> 46:14.920]  and blackjack and it's just illegal. Like you just can't do it. They won't tolerate it. Yeah.
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.500]  How do they prove you're doing it? Uh, because your betting amounts. So like typically if you're,
[46:19.660 --> 46:23.300]  you want to see a majority of the cards, right? So you're going to be making small bets. And then
[46:23.300 --> 46:28.840]  once the shoe becomes more beneficial to you, like there's a lot of face cards in it or tens,
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.160]  then you start making higher bets because you have a higher probability of winning off of those hands.
[46:33.160 --> 46:37.400]  That just seems like a part of the game to me. I just don't understand. It is that that's,
[46:37.460 --> 46:41.400]  but that's why I'm saying they don't need to rig the games because the rules are rigged within
[46:41.400 --> 46:46.800]  themselves. I wouldn't be surprised if you were a multi-millionaire, Andrew, just off gambling.
[46:46.960 --> 46:53.240]  Oh no. You just never told us. Well, the reason I know about your perfect roulette record is I
[46:53.240 --> 46:59.400]  went like a historic 0 for 28 in roulette plays where I just couldn't win. Like it,
[46:59.400 --> 47:05.740]  mathematically impossible. Like the five blacks in a row, I couldn't win. And I kept doing black.
[47:06.040 --> 47:10.160]  I was like, you know, I was doing the color thing, doing the Wesley Snipes, always bet on black
[47:10.160 --> 47:14.680]  thing. I'd bet on black, always red, always red, no matter what I did. Even in Animal Crossing,
[47:14.700 --> 47:20.100]  there's a roulette game you could play. That was red. I just kept losing on red. So I talked to
[47:20.100 --> 47:24.260]  you about roulette randomly and you're like, yeah, I'm undefeated in roulette. Every time I go to
[47:24.260 --> 47:31.200]  Vegas, I've won. I'm like 5 for 5. Unstoppable. We went 0 for 4, the two of us. I'd ask you what
[47:31.200 --> 47:35.000]  color to put down. And then you're just like, oh, I guess it just doesn't translate over.
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.360]  I guess I need to be there. No, I think we need to be doing it in person. And I would be willing
[47:39.360 --> 47:44.180]  to come out of retirement on a real life roulette table with you. And you just bet with me and I
[47:44.180 --> 47:50.460]  think we'll be in it. Either you'll destroy everything I've worked towards or we'll just
[47:50.460 --> 47:55.180]  continue as normal and you'll be you'll be up on it. I'd be great. I just hope you don't bring
[47:55.180 --> 48:01.140]  me down. Oh, I'm going to bring you down. Absolutely. If you guys win big in Vegas,
[48:01.280 --> 48:08.920]  you need to immediately go and buy the two nicest ceramic tea kettles to celebrate.
[48:12.040 --> 48:21.940]  I like the split. I don't know if like Celine or Hermes or Givenchy makes a tea kettle.
[48:22.560 --> 48:27.320]  And if it's like encrusted in like diamonds and gold, you need to buy it.
[48:28.860 --> 48:35.060]  I did that with, um, I didn't buy a kettle. This is just gambling stuff. My guardian for RTX,
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.540]  Charles, who I now work with. One of my favorite people. We went to Vegas for something.
[48:39.540 --> 48:43.900]  And, um, I was trying to convince him to gamble. He was like, no, you know, I'm never going to do
[48:43.900 --> 48:48.600]  that. It's not me. I'm not going to do it. And I just sat down at a slot machine. I don't have
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.900]  anything special with slots. Like I just, I just lose money in those. And, uh, I just play like
[48:52.900 --> 48:57.880]  kind of low amounts. He sat down next to me at a slot machine and, uh, you know, they come around,
[48:57.940 --> 49:01.160]  they offer you free drinks and stuff if you're actually gambling, but he wasn't doing anything
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.660]  at his machine. I was like, look, you're going to sit here. Let's just, just put in a dollar,
[49:05.660 --> 49:10.960]  just see what happens. And he was like, oh, fine. Like caving to the peer pressure.
[49:11.360 --> 49:19.120]  He won $650 off a single first spin. And he, I don't think he ever spun again. I think he just
[49:19.120 --> 49:23.500]  cashed out and that was it. And I was like, man, I've got, I must be providing a little bit of
[49:23.500 --> 49:29.780]  luck. So I, I w I would love to test that out with you, Andrew, at, in Vegas at some point.
[49:29.880 --> 49:34.640]  I think my bad luck counters your good luck. And it's not even close as lucky as you are.
[49:34.640 --> 49:37.920]  It's not even a statement on how lucky you are. I'm sure you're incredibly lucky.
[49:38.380 --> 49:42.880]  I don't think, I think I, I overpower. Yeah, I got to agree with that. I think those,
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.380]  and those opposing forces, Andrew's, uh, I don't know if it's luck or karma or whatever,
[49:48.500 --> 49:51.940]  but I feel like it's a lot stronger. Yeah. I don't, honestly, I didn't think my,
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.500]  I didn't think Charles winning was my luck transferring. It was just, he's very lucky.
[49:56.060 --> 50:02.180]  Cause when I watched Dan play roulette, he loses. Yeah, but come on, it's Dan.
[50:02.580 --> 50:04.100]  The universe has a sense of humor.
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.620]  Maybe he's like sub dog shit level as well. God damn dude. Dan and I are in the same level. He
[50:11.620 --> 50:19.480]  just doesn't know it probably. He's also a universe's shit doormat. Oh, this is, this is a
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.160]  good, I'm having, this is a fun episode. Do you think Geoff, we should start recording in person?
[50:25.180 --> 50:29.000]  Well, how are we going to record with Andrew? Well, I mean, you and I could be in person.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.860]  I mean, yeah, that would be fun, but I feel like we'd, it'd be an, it'd be an,
[50:33.280 --> 50:36.100]  like, it wouldn't be balanced for Andrew. I feel like we're all in the same,
[50:36.740 --> 50:40.700]  we're all in the same playing field when we're, when we're alone. But I feel like the dynamic
[50:40.700 --> 50:44.540]  would be weird if you and I were in person, but Andrew wasn't. You might be right. I'm just
[50:44.540 --> 50:48.640]  really excited to do stuff in person. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not opposed to it. You know,
[50:48.700 --> 50:52.780]  it's like, that's how we do the break shit stuff. But how do you, how would you feel about it,
[50:52.780 --> 50:58.700]  Andrew? I think it would be a little weird because the timing is just different for you guys. Like,
[50:58.700 --> 51:02.620]  it's more immediate, like, conversationally. I think we're kind of all equally in a delayed
[51:02.620 --> 51:06.420]  window, which makes this work. I mean, I'm not, I'm not opposed to try it. I think we would have
[51:06.420 --> 51:09.920]  to do it with headphones because on the break shit, it's kind of hard to hear through the
[51:09.920 --> 51:15.900]  little speaker. I also don't know that you guys would have benefited by me being in person in front
[51:15.900 --> 51:20.600]  of you last episode, for instance. Like, you know? Well, you weren't, you were, you're paying a bill.
[51:21.060 --> 51:23.020]  Well, because you would have been in your backyard. You were literally not there.
[51:23.020 --> 51:29.840]  Yeah. You know. But I'm gonna, this is like, we've recorded a bunch because people are going
[51:29.840 --> 51:33.920]  on like summer breaks. I'm gonna, we're taking like a little, it's not going to stop for the
[51:33.920 --> 51:39.060]  people. We've got like six. This episode will come out on August 4th. Are you serious? That's
[51:39.060 --> 51:43.560]  how far ahead we are. This is an August 4th episode. You know what I feel worst about in
[51:43.560 --> 51:51.880]  that whole deal? Is that the amount of time since we decided to record the bike trick is, it's been
[51:51.880 --> 51:57.440]  a bit of time. Yeah. Like maybe a week, but it's been like six episodes. Yeah. We should do that
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.520]  this week. We should do it this week, but it's not going to come out till October at this point.
[52:01.640 --> 52:05.920]  As long as we've got it in the bag. Yeah. Yeah. As long as we got in the bag. I mean, it's to be
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.860]  fair to us too. Every time we've tried, there's been rain. And when you're dealing with, when
[52:09.860 --> 52:14.520]  you're dealing with bad-ass bike tricks and a drainage ditch, the ditch has got to be drained.
[52:15.020 --> 52:20.380]  That's all there is to it. That is a great point. Yeah. I do see on the, on the old weather map
[52:20.380 --> 52:25.280]  though, there's still, there's some sun peeking behind a cloud coming up. Really? I, uh, well,
[52:25.360 --> 52:31.120]  I'm, I'm out of town next week. Uh, I'm not around next week, but I am around today, uh, tomorrow and,
[52:31.120 --> 52:37.800]  and throughout the weekend. So, um, we could try tomorrow. The icon is a cloud with lightning with
[52:37.800 --> 52:48.000]  a 90% chance. It'd be great. It's weird. Does not want me to pull off this bad-ass bike trick.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.440]  You know what though? Even if it's raining, it would add an element in the slow-mo.
[52:52.240 --> 52:57.840]  That's true. It would, it would look cooler. You'd look like a very rad dude, Geoff. Why don't we just
[52:57.840 --> 53:02.280]  do it tomorrow? No matter what. Well, what is tomorrow? Wednesday or Thursday, Friday,
[53:02.380 --> 53:06.220]  tomorrow's Friday? Yeah. Well, it's, it's not, it's the, isn't he worried about the landing?
[53:06.500 --> 53:13.400]  As you shoot the rain, right? Why? I mean, I'd have to go through, listen, if it's not a boat,
[53:13.400 --> 53:19.000]  it's a bicycle. So I, the bike's not going to go through the raging river. That is the drainage,
[53:19.100 --> 53:25.200]  if it's too wet. Uh, yeah, man, I am a busy, I have a thing from 10 to 11, but other than that,
[53:25.220 --> 53:29.660]  I'm free. So right after that I can hop on my bike and head out. Maybe a little noon bike trip.
[53:30.040 --> 53:34.500]  Well, noon bike trip. I'll get the Phantom ready. All right. I think, I think that's all we need.
[53:34.540 --> 53:38.500]  Just a lovely slow-mo. We don't need any like behind the scenes or anything. No, no, no,
[53:38.500 --> 53:42.380]  not at all. It'd be, uh, it'd be fun. It'd be fun. We'll just have to make sure that it's,
[53:42.380 --> 53:46.740]  you know, I'll, I'll, uh, I was gonna say I'll do it after this, but I gotta go into art,
[53:46.820 --> 53:52.460]  into work to do first night. So I'll, uh, I'll check tomorrow to make sure the course is clear
[53:52.460 --> 53:56.860]  before you roll out your Phantom. This has turned into like a shuttle launch. You're just doing a
[53:56.860 --> 54:00.500]  bike trick. I don't know why, like we need ideal, like perfect weather, weather conditions.
[54:01.420 --> 54:07.060]  Once again, do you want to be mission control? Yeah, I'd love to do the trick if it's submerged.
[54:07.300 --> 54:11.620]  Sure. That's totally fair. Just in my head, it doesn't like I, in my head, it's a puddle, Geoff,
[54:11.620 --> 54:18.020]  at the bottom of like a pool, like a ramp. It's not a, it's not a waterfall, but I'm sure it's,
[54:18.020 --> 54:23.440]  I'm sure it is. Okay. That's just in my head. That's the visual. I'm excited about it. I'm
[54:23.440 --> 54:26.720]  excited about it. Well, that's all that matters to me. As long as you're excited about it. This
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.060]  is great. It's nice to be excited about stuff. It is. You know, it's weird when this comes out,
[54:31.440 --> 54:36.340]  my birthday's tomorrow. I don't know what I'm going to do. Your birthday's tomorrow? Well,
[54:36.420 --> 54:41.040]  when this comes out, that's how far ahead we are. Your birthday is the 5th of August. My birthday
[54:41.040 --> 54:46.880]  is the 5th of August. Hey, let me be the first person to wish you a happy 27th birthday. Is it
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.060]  27? It's 27. You got it right. If you wouldn't have second guessed it, I would have been impressed.
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.460]  I, uh, I'm just making sure I said it right. And I wished you a happy 27th birthday before anybody
[54:56.460 --> 55:01.540]  else did, I think. Thank you. Yeah. No, you're, you're definitely the first. I have a gift for
[55:01.540 --> 55:07.660]  you guys as, as a thing to celebrate, celebrate this. A bigger gift than that kettle bowl.
[55:08.260 --> 55:15.780]  Bigger. We'll see. We'll see how this gift goes. This is as well established. This is a redemption
[55:15.780 --> 55:20.700]  year for me. Last year, a lot of things didn't necessarily go the way I had planned. There
[55:20.700 --> 55:26.360]  were some pretty big obvious ones. The main one I'd say is the fire extinguisher. The fire
[55:26.360 --> 55:34.040]  extinguisher bit did not go as planned. So I have a new fire extinguisher. No way. I have a new fire
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.920]  extinguisher. I have it bagged up just like last time. It really is going all in on this. Are you
[55:39.920 --> 55:44.980]  serious? I'm going all in on the redemption tour. I got it in my hands right now. I love that you
[55:44.980 --> 55:50.640]  did that whole mess of whatever last episode was next to a new fire extinguisher. Yeah. It was
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.240]  behind me. So like when we were talking about, do we even want to do a second episode? It's like,
[55:54.260 --> 56:00.020]  yeah, we want to do a second episode. I got a fire extinguisher in a bag ready to go. We're
[56:00.020 --> 56:07.140]  here. The bag. I'm trying to find the handle through the bag. Where are you going to be
[56:07.140 --> 56:13.080]  videoing any of this? I you do like I need both hands on the bag to hold even hold this.
[56:13.380 --> 56:19.560]  So let's just prop a camera up. Proper fine. I don't you don't you don't much like the kettle
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.220]  Gavin. You do not know my reality right now. I need I need to even just find
[56:27.300 --> 56:32.840]  where is the. Okay, so that's the nozzle. So where is the top? Is this a brand new,
[56:33.140 --> 56:37.600]  fresh fire? This is a brand new, fresh fire extinguisher. I think never before been fired.
[56:37.800 --> 56:43.580]  Never before been fired. It's fully charged. What's that pressure gauge reading? Oh, it was
[56:43.580 --> 56:47.700]  it was in the green. It was solidly in the green. That's where we want it to be.
[56:54.830 --> 57:03.610]  Oh, my God. We did it. Fuck you, Minor League Jack. That one went off.
[57:06.190 --> 57:08.090]  Happy birthday to me. That was an extended spray.
[57:08.610 --> 57:12.890]  Oh, yeah. I mean, it was a disappointment last time. I wanted to make sure I got it.
[57:14.550 --> 57:19.550]  There you go. A fucking fire extinguisher for you. Happy August.
[57:20.710 --> 57:23.810]  Was it all contained? Oh, yeah, it's all contained. I don't know.
[57:24.010 --> 57:29.270]  Like I was I thought it was going to fire like a rocket was my concern. So it's in like 15 garbage
[57:29.270 --> 57:37.030]  bags. I'm surprised it didn't rupture any of them. It may have. I don't know. We'll find out.
[57:38.030 --> 57:41.630]  I can start opening it. I mean, it's going to take a while. It's like a Russian doll.
[57:46.990 --> 57:50.730]  I love the way you do stuff. You just start doing it. There's no buildup.
[57:50.730 --> 57:53.490]  There's no countdown. You're just like, yeah, so I got a new fire.
[57:57.410 --> 58:01.630]  I'm actually I'm not going to. I opened one of these bags and I already I feel like it's in
[58:01.630 --> 58:05.750]  the air. I feel like my eyes are starting to burn a little bit. So we're going to put it back in
[58:05.750 --> 58:11.610]  that bag and we'll we'll deal with that problem later. But there we go. I feel fire extinguisher
[58:11.610 --> 58:18.410]  redeemed. I hope you will document this in photo form for us to put on the Instagram at some.
[58:18.470 --> 58:22.910]  I will. I will take a photo of the bags and the and the unopening of it when I get there. I'll
[58:22.910 --> 58:27.430]  take a photo of the kettle as well. I have some work to do. Maybe with all this redemption
[58:27.430 --> 58:32.470]  happening, there'll be roulette redemption. Maybe this is it. All of this stuff will turn
[58:32.470 --> 58:37.290]  your luck around. I could be it. I bet if I picked a color for you now, it would win.
[58:37.290 --> 58:42.670]  Yeah. Do you want to do that right now? Yeah. Okay. Give me a second. I'll log into my account.
[58:43.630 --> 58:46.750]  Nick can edit this so it won't be an awkward long pause. Although,
[58:46.910 --> 58:51.250]  because I said that, now he probably won't. And I'll just be extended.
[58:54.390 --> 58:58.290]  Nick, I'm glad you're back. I miss Nick. It's great having Nick back.
[59:00.110 --> 59:04.170]  Do you have a gut instinct, Gavin, as far as what are you feeling right now? What is your process?
[59:04.170 --> 59:09.790]  Is it just in the moment you'll say you'll know? I know what I'm going to say, and I feel like I'll
[59:09.790 --> 59:13.370]  just say it to you in the moment. Okay. How much are you thinking about putting?
[59:13.950 --> 59:17.150]  How much do you think I should? Well, I'm going to feel pretty
[59:17.150 --> 59:23.510]  responsible if you lose. $1.50? $50? That's a lot.
[59:24.050 --> 59:29.250]  I can't remember what we were doing last time. My bets with Geoff on the NBA were 10-cent bets,
[59:29.250 --> 59:35.730]  and you want me to come out roulette? I'm willing to do $50 because of the energy of the $5,000 guy.
[59:36.150 --> 59:39.810]  But last time you did roulette and I made you lose, what did you lose?
[59:40.110 --> 59:41.930]  I think $20. Oh, $20?
[59:42.210 --> 59:46.950]  I think so. Yeah, definitely not $50. $50, that's a lot of ramen.
[59:47.350 --> 59:51.090]  That's a lot of ramen. You should bet enough that if you win,
[59:51.150 --> 59:55.950]  you can replace the bowl you broke. Okay, I gotta figure out inflation.
[01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:04.430]  I haven't seen a bowl like that since the 80s. I think it's that old.
[01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:10.930]  What am I putting in? What is the bet amount? What are we doing? Is it $50? Is $50 the roulette bet?
[01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:17.370]  What about a nice $25 so that you win? Okay, $25. I sometimes do this anyway.
[01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:21.950]  I call this a free lunch bet. If I win, I get a free lunch. I'll buy myself lunch.
[01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:25.970]  Don't have to think about it. If I lose, I can have a free lunch. Make something.
[01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:31.750]  Okay, we're authorizing. Deposit successful. Okay, we're going to the live casino.
[01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:41.150]  Hey, try not to piss everybody off. Okay, should I share my screen?
[01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:44.450]  Can I do that? Yeah. Okay, let's do that.
[01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:46.670]  Oh, yeah, I see it. Okay, so here we go.
[01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.550]  So what are we doing? Where are we going? Black.
[01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:51.330]  What's the bet, Gavin? Black? Yep.
[01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:55.330]  Oh, shit. I didn't mean to put it there. Okay, there we go.
[01:00:55.950 --> 01:01:00.430]  I was gonna say red. Interesting. I was hoping that Gavin and I would be on the same page.
[01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.110]  We are definitely not. Click, zoom in. Okay, here we go.
[01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:06.950]  What, I bet on black? You bet on black? Okay, it's spitting.
[01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:12.530]  You're the worst.
[01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.650]  Ooh. Ooh.
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:22.690]  It was red. It doesn't translate at all.
[01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.120]  I think I need to be betting too. I think that's how we'll do it.
[01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:31.610]  Now you have a system? We couldn't have the system before?
[01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:34.490]  I don't know why we just did that. We already knew it wouldn't work.
[01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.890]  I said black, I never went on black.
[01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:43.150]  I maybe thought all the redemption would have turned your luck.
[01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:45.870]  No. No.
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:55.010]  Let's end the podcast. Happy birthday to me. Down 25 to start the day.
[01:01:56.510 --> 01:02:01.090]  I just made you lose 25 dollars again. Yep, you sure did.
[01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:07.770]  Hey, on the bright side, you're one birthday wish richer. You can always spend that.
[01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:12.250]  End the show. I'm gonna get you a gift. I'm gonna make up for that.
[01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:15.990]  I'm gonna send you something. You're gonna send me 25 dollars worth of
[01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:18.890]  fucking Branstad pickles, you son of a bitch? What are you gonna do?
[01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:22.510]  Wait, wait, wait. You mean Branstad pickle the condiment?
[01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:25.190]  The condiment, yeah. Everyone's favorite condiment.
[01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.790]  Ay yi yi, thanks for listening to F*** Face.
