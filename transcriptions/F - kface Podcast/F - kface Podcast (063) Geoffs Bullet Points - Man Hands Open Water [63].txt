[00:19.320 --> 00:20.140]  14.
[00:22.640 --> 00:39.110]  Are there any boy bands where the lead is the most talented?
[00:39.690 --> 00:41.410]  I mean, I would think NSYNC.
[00:43.130 --> 00:45.930]  No, Justin Timberlake was not the lead in NSYNC.
[00:46.050 --> 00:46.990]  He was the side guy.
[00:47.130 --> 00:47.950]  He was like the third guy.
[00:47.970 --> 00:48.450]  I'm sorry.
[00:49.210 --> 00:49.610]  What?
[00:50.590 --> 00:51.390]  The lead...
[00:51.390 --> 00:53.510]  You're out of your fucking mind, dude.
[00:53.610 --> 00:56.390]  Yeah, I don't think you lived through it like I had to.
[00:56.570 --> 00:57.090]  Are you...
[00:57.090 --> 00:57.670]  What do you think?
[00:57.850 --> 00:58.990]  Like J.C. Chazet?
[00:59.550 --> 01:03.610]  I'm not saying popularity, I'm saying that the structure of the group, he was not the
[01:03.610 --> 01:04.590]  captain of the team.
[01:04.670 --> 01:05.610]  He was the all-star.
[01:06.150 --> 01:06.650]  I don't even...
[01:06.650 --> 01:07.690]  Was his name J.C.?
[01:08.210 --> 01:10.530]  J.C. Chazet was not the lead in NSYNC.
[01:10.530 --> 01:13.170]  He was the captain of the team.
[01:13.450 --> 01:13.550]  No.
[01:13.670 --> 01:14.030]  Absolutely.
[01:14.350 --> 01:14.510]  No.
[01:14.630 --> 01:15.130]  Absolutely not.
[01:15.550 --> 01:17.570]  Every photo you see, he's the captain.
[01:17.710 --> 01:18.350]  He's the leading guy.
[01:18.810 --> 01:20.090]  You don't think he has leading vibes?
[01:20.170 --> 01:20.910]  He has leading vibes.
[01:21.010 --> 01:21.930]  He's not the most talented.
[01:22.490 --> 01:23.210]  He was the leader of that team.
[01:23.210 --> 01:24.050]  He also doesn't have leading vibes.
[01:24.190 --> 01:26.610]  I mean, like, he had like a solo career, and where did that go?
[01:27.090 --> 01:27.450]  Terrible.
[01:27.670 --> 01:28.630]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:28.750 --> 01:33.970]  I just searched pictures of NSYNC, and there are so many pictures where he is not the center
[01:33.970 --> 01:36.110]  guy, but Justin Timberlake is.
[01:36.230 --> 01:37.470]  You're out of your fucking mind.
[01:37.470 --> 01:39.670]  First one I pulled up, he's the center guy.
[01:39.670 --> 01:40.770]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:40.770 --> 01:44.170]  You're out of your fucking mind.
[01:44.190 --> 01:44.890]  That one he's not.
[01:45.110 --> 01:46.010]  Okay, that one he's not.
[01:46.090 --> 01:47.330]  Maybe with time, this changed.
[01:47.430 --> 01:48.090]  You're ridiculous.
[01:48.210 --> 01:48.810]  This is ridiculous.
[01:49.210 --> 01:49.610]  Just...
[01:50.570 --> 01:51.610]  This might be...
[01:51.610 --> 01:51.950]  I might be...
[01:51.950 --> 01:52.810]  Episode 63.
[01:53.310 --> 01:53.630]  Yeah.
[01:53.710 --> 01:54.070]  All yours.
[01:54.890 --> 01:56.950]  Well, how do you follow that up?
[01:57.050 --> 02:03.090]  You guys came in hot with the, who was the lead of NSYNC fight, and I just stood back
[02:03.090 --> 02:05.150]  and let it happen, because I got no dog in that hunt.
[02:07.090 --> 02:08.550]  Who was the lead of NSYNC, Gavin?
[02:08.550 --> 02:09.410]  Let me guess.
[02:09.530 --> 02:10.570]  Andrew was way off.
[02:11.070 --> 02:11.930]  Justin Timberlake.
[02:12.730 --> 02:12.970]  Okay.
[02:13.110 --> 02:13.830]  Maybe I was.
[02:13.970 --> 02:15.350]  I thought the other guy was the lead.
[02:15.690 --> 02:17.990]  I'll be honest, I don't know anyone else's name from that band.
[02:18.410 --> 02:18.650]  Okay.
[02:18.770 --> 02:23.050]  Although there's the other guy, who according to Andrew is the head of NSYNC.
[02:23.330 --> 02:24.710]  Backstreet Boys were way bigger.
[02:25.290 --> 02:25.650]  Were they?
[02:26.430 --> 02:27.230]  For a time.
[02:27.530 --> 02:27.970]  Oh, definitely.
[02:28.150 --> 02:28.370]  No.
[02:29.350 --> 02:31.490]  Backstreet Boys were an international sensation.
[02:31.950 --> 02:33.690]  You don't think NSYNC was an international sensation?
[02:34.130 --> 02:34.530]  They both were.
[02:34.670 --> 02:35.670]  Not to the same extent.
[02:35.670 --> 02:40.790]  The coolest thing about the Backstreet Boys was getting an album from Burger King as a
[02:40.790 --> 02:41.070]  kid.
[02:41.490 --> 02:45.650]  I don't remember what the promotion was exactly, but you could get an album from a drive-thru
[02:45.650 --> 02:46.390]  at Burger King.
[02:46.570 --> 02:47.370]  It was fantastic.
[02:47.510 --> 02:48.030]  Did you get it?
[02:48.450 --> 02:49.350]  Of course I did.
[02:49.710 --> 02:50.050]  Great album.
[02:50.790 --> 02:55.430]  I gotta say, I'm gonna step back again, and I'm gonna defer to your expertise here, Gav,
[02:55.470 --> 02:58.150]  because I was never into NSYNC or Backstreet Boys.
[02:58.230 --> 02:59.790]  I didn't have the posters on the wall like you.
[03:00.350 --> 03:06.230]  Obviously, as I think you're a card-carrying member of both fan clubs, I understand that
[03:06.230 --> 03:10.370]  you know those two entities better than I, so yeah.
[03:10.830 --> 03:11.570]  Hats off to you, sir.
[03:11.850 --> 03:12.290]  Oh, thanks.
[03:12.390 --> 03:12.550]  Yeah.
[03:12.870 --> 03:14.030]  Big-time fan of both.
[03:15.490 --> 03:15.870]  What is this?
[03:16.010 --> 03:16.250]  JC?
[03:16.830 --> 03:17.090]  JC?
[03:17.090 --> 03:17.630]  I'm just dropping it.
[03:17.710 --> 03:19.830]  You do a Google search of who is the lead in NSYNC.
[03:19.930 --> 03:21.270]  It's the top thing that comes up.
[03:21.490 --> 03:24.730]  I don't think I'm crazy in my take that JC was the lead of the band.
[03:24.990 --> 03:26.150]  Was Timberlake backup?
[03:27.150 --> 03:27.370]  Yeah.
[03:27.430 --> 03:28.430]  He was a side player.
[03:29.030 --> 03:30.610]  He eventually became the lead.
[03:30.730 --> 03:31.770]  Hang... hang...
[03:31.770 --> 03:32.710]  Along with Justin.
[03:32.710 --> 03:33.650]  Is this fucking...
[03:33.650 --> 03:34.090]  Hang on.
[03:34.610 --> 03:35.750]  Read what it says.
[03:35.970 --> 03:36.730]  Read that out loud.
[03:37.170 --> 03:37.730]  Yeah, I'll read it.
[03:37.810 --> 03:38.410]  I'll read it out loud.
[03:38.610 --> 03:42.290]  Along with Justin, JC Chazos was the lead singer of NSYNC.
[03:42.490 --> 03:44.430]  I think the Justin thing came later, though.
[03:44.710 --> 03:45.670]  I think that was the thing.
[03:45.730 --> 03:47.530]  He was so talented, became co-lead.
[03:47.730 --> 03:51.490]  I don't think he was always lead, based on some of the music videos and the photos.
[03:51.930 --> 03:54.850]  Why does it say, I'm the only member of the band to achieve solo success?
[03:55.430 --> 03:55.830]  Exactly.
[03:56.350 --> 03:57.490]  Well, because that was accurate.
[03:57.490 --> 03:58.930]  That's just a fact that happened.
[03:59.850 --> 04:00.970]  That's also accurate.
[04:01.210 --> 04:02.370]  But isn't that talking about Justin?
[04:02.970 --> 04:03.270]  Yeah.
[04:03.590 --> 04:05.810]  Well, the phrasing of that sentence is terrible, then.
[04:06.150 --> 04:10.570]  Along with Justin, JC Chazos was the lead singer of NSYNC.
[04:10.670 --> 04:11.310]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[04:11.730 --> 04:13.070]  That is a terribly written thing.
[04:13.170 --> 04:16.330]  JC Chazos is not the only one to achieve solo success in music.
[04:16.830 --> 04:17.270]  How...
[04:17.270 --> 04:19.050]  Can you say his last name a few more times?
[04:19.150 --> 04:20.010]  I'm really enjoying it.
[04:20.870 --> 04:21.310]  Chazos?
[04:21.890 --> 04:22.330]  Chazos?
[04:22.590 --> 04:22.730]  No.
[04:22.810 --> 04:23.390]  Yeah, that's great.
[04:23.530 --> 04:23.770]  That's great.
[04:23.770 --> 04:29.210]  Eric has said it for you about 10 times in the last three minutes, but I like your pronunciation
[04:29.210 --> 04:29.430]  better.
[04:29.510 --> 04:29.930]  No, go ahead.
[04:30.130 --> 04:30.990]  You say it again, Eric.
[04:31.070 --> 04:31.790]  I want to hear it.
[04:31.790 --> 04:33.550]  It is JC Chazos.
[04:33.770 --> 04:34.250]  Chazos.
[04:34.630 --> 04:35.590]  That's a fancy name.
[04:35.710 --> 04:40.270]  I also love that below that little snippet, there's a BBC article that's headlined,
[04:40.430 --> 04:43.190]  What happened to NSYNC members who aren't Justin Timberlake?
[04:45.390 --> 04:46.470]  That's part of the article.
[04:47.770 --> 04:49.930]  What episode is this, my friends?
[04:51.110 --> 04:52.610]  63, I believe.
[04:53.130 --> 04:56.010]  It's 63, and it's going to be a good one, boys.
[04:56.230 --> 04:57.190]  I'm very excited.
[04:57.690 --> 05:03.950]  Geoff's been away in a foreign land, and I haven't really spoken to him at all since
[05:03.950 --> 05:04.410]  he's been back.
[05:04.690 --> 05:05.790]  Just been having...
[05:05.790 --> 05:10.950]  Geoff, you've been sending us the most interesting updates without any of the information.
[05:11.250 --> 05:14.630]  And I honestly, I've been excited about recording all damn day.
[05:15.130 --> 05:15.430]  Okay.
[05:15.670 --> 05:16.390]  Here's what I have.
[05:16.570 --> 05:17.890]  I wrote down some bullet points.
[05:18.790 --> 05:22.290]  I have a recommended order, but I'll just read them off.
[05:22.710 --> 05:24.250]  Number one thing I want to talk about.
[05:24.710 --> 05:25.930]  I'll just write down what I wrote.
[05:26.230 --> 05:27.030]  Say what I wrote.
[05:27.370 --> 05:28.230]  Man hands.
[05:30.070 --> 05:30.790]  Here's the next one.
[05:30.930 --> 05:31.730]  Open water.
[05:32.350 --> 05:32.970]  Here's the next one.
[05:33.990 --> 05:34.430]  Backpack.
[05:34.910 --> 05:35.730]  Here's the next one.
[05:36.010 --> 05:36.750]  This is from today.
[05:37.190 --> 05:38.030]  Purple nightmare.
[05:38.730 --> 05:39.850]  Yeah, it sure was.
[05:40.010 --> 05:41.030]  It's followed you home.
[05:41.410 --> 05:45.450]  The most recent one, which I sent to you guys about an hour ago, two hours ago,
[05:45.450 --> 05:48.770]  which was just, this one just says, regulation fart.
[05:50.490 --> 05:54.870]  And then I have a space for my queries and insights, which I don't know that we'll get to this episode,
[05:54.990 --> 05:55.790]  but we're recording two.
[05:57.090 --> 06:00.590]  We're recording two, because I think you're going to a foreign land, Gavin.
[06:01.010 --> 06:02.170]  So we need to prepare for that.
[06:03.850 --> 06:07.730]  And then whatever you want to talk about, Gavin, and whatever you want to talk about, Andrew,
[06:07.810 --> 06:09.390]  because it's a quorum.
[06:09.890 --> 06:11.310]  Goddamn, I feel like I just want to listen.
[06:11.710 --> 06:12.970]  Yeah, I'm really excited.
[06:12.970 --> 06:16.950]  You texted me over a week ago at this point.
[06:17.310 --> 06:20.090]  Boy, do I have an ocean rescue story for you.
[06:20.710 --> 06:21.510]  Nothing else.
[06:22.150 --> 06:25.390]  And it's just left me time to just admit, I don't know what's happening.
[06:25.850 --> 06:27.770]  I don't know if you're being rescued, I hope.
[06:28.030 --> 06:33.510]  And my heart of heart, my dream, is that you went on a jet ski expedition
[06:33.510 --> 06:36.890]  and it went horribly wrong that required rescue.
[06:37.390 --> 06:42.910]  Before we hit Geoff's stuff, I have a list of stuff, but I think the only thing that I kind of want to touch on
[06:42.910 --> 06:45.630]  is the stuff that just links us from previous episodes.
[06:45.810 --> 06:46.450]  And it's super quick.
[06:47.210 --> 06:51.870]  What I liked is that because everyone was drawing the layout of your room, Andrew,
[06:52.050 --> 06:57.210]  a lot of people, a lot of the comment leavers drew some very accurate stuff.
[06:57.330 --> 07:01.070]  But then when that episode came out, we posted the video that you took
[07:01.070 --> 07:04.630]  where you were just sort of 360 degrees filming around the room.
[07:05.150 --> 07:11.290]  And I noticed a really bizarre line of thought across so many individual comment leavers.
[07:11.290 --> 07:15.810]  A lot of people were blown away at how bright your room was.
[07:15.870 --> 07:18.210]  They were like, wow, it's so much brighter than I imagined.
[07:18.350 --> 07:20.390]  Oh, weird. It's like, it's really bright.
[07:20.510 --> 07:26.770]  And I've realized everyone has been imagining you in this dingy, dark little room
[07:26.770 --> 07:29.530]  as if you record every podcast in the dark.
[07:29.610 --> 07:33.030]  And I don't know how that sort of infiltrated their minds,
[07:33.070 --> 07:38.190]  but there are so many comments that are like, wow, that's just like a normal room.
[07:40.750 --> 07:43.630]  Like you record from some hole in the ground.
[07:43.810 --> 07:46.430]  Yeah, as if they expected it to be something other than human.
[07:46.910 --> 07:49.610]  Exactly. Well, to a certain level, I'm insulted.
[07:50.070 --> 07:54.570]  But on a second point, I agree my room is way too goddamn bright.
[07:54.670 --> 07:58.590]  I don't have like a proper curtain for my big window for what they put in.
[07:59.030 --> 08:01.790]  So during the day, it's so bright in here. It's terrible.
[08:02.190 --> 08:03.690]  Even at night, it's not great.
[08:04.210 --> 08:07.690]  So beyond the insult, I agree with them. My room is way too bright.
[08:07.690 --> 08:09.950]  I don't think they were saying it should be darker.
[08:10.410 --> 08:13.230]  No, but they're pointing out how bright it is.
[08:13.330 --> 08:17.010]  I guess your statement is that they're doing it in contrast to their expectation.
[08:17.470 --> 08:23.250]  Where I'm just saying as a general room, my room is brighter than most bedrooms, I'd say, with the curtains down.
[08:24.030 --> 08:25.410]  It's an ineffective curtain.
[08:25.930 --> 08:27.270]  Why do you want to be in a dark room?
[08:27.610 --> 08:31.770]  Why? Just like when you wake up in the morning, it's fucking the sun's blasting me in the face every morning.
[08:31.770 --> 08:32.530]  I don't like it.
[08:32.830 --> 08:37.170]  No, I want the choice to do that.
[08:37.170 --> 08:39.790]  I want to go over to the curtain and blast myself.
[08:39.810 --> 08:42.950]  I don't want the sun just blasting me whenever it feels like.
[08:43.010 --> 08:44.170]  That's totally achievable, though.
[08:44.550 --> 08:45.510]  How would I do that?
[08:45.790 --> 08:46.790]  Just buy a blackout blind or something.
[08:47.190 --> 08:49.210]  Yeah, I'd need to do work. I'd need to set that up.
[08:49.310 --> 08:52.530]  I'm saying the blinds that came with the place are not functional in that way.
[08:52.950 --> 08:54.230]  I'd have to modify it.
[08:54.450 --> 08:55.750]  You know who can help is Amazon.
[08:56.250 --> 08:56.810]  Can they?
[08:57.130 --> 08:58.530]  Yeah, you can buy curtains on Amazon.
[08:58.790 --> 09:00.810]  Well, no, but I have to install the curtains then.
[09:00.870 --> 09:05.850]  It's not like I need a curtain rod, I need to get a screwdriver, I need a ladder.
[09:06.610 --> 09:08.370]  We're talking several steps here.
[09:08.630 --> 09:14.350]  I feel like there's very little that you can't do with a drill and a...
[09:14.350 --> 09:17.170]  Well, just a drill, really. Just some bits. Some screwdriver bits.
[09:17.530 --> 09:19.290]  You think I could do that job with a screwdriver?
[09:19.830 --> 09:25.850]  Yes. A chair is a ladder, a desk is a ladder, a screwdriver... you've got to have a screwdriver in your house.
[09:26.150 --> 09:29.430]  Oh, I definitely do, but I feel like I need to mount something to the wall.
[09:29.550 --> 09:31.530]  This is a very specific setup, these windows.
[09:31.530 --> 09:35.830]  Maybe a little pilot hole? Get the drills in there? The screws?
[09:36.170 --> 09:37.410]  Certainly make it easier on you.
[09:37.570 --> 09:45.390]  It would. I mean, I could take a photo right now if you want. I'd have to go above the window. It's a poorly designed thing.
[09:45.770 --> 09:48.610]  I'll never turn down an opportunity to get a photo from you, to be honest.
[09:49.050 --> 09:49.990]  I'll turn around and take a photo.
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.780]  I mean, I figured you guys should fill the time. I figured you'd do literally anything. That was my cue.
[09:58.260 --> 10:00.120]  I'm going to need a minute, you guys fill.
[10:00.820 --> 10:02.080]  Hey, Gav, how's it going, buddy?
[10:02.700 --> 10:04.820]  Now you don't need to. I've missed you, Geoff.
[10:05.160 --> 10:09.740]  I've missed you as well. We still haven't filmed the super badass bike stunt yet, unfortunately.
[10:09.740 --> 10:11.000]  What are you doing tomorrow?
[10:12.360 --> 10:14.520]  I have a shitload of meetings tomorrow, unfortunately.
[10:15.040 --> 10:16.560]  What are you doing Saturday?
[10:17.740 --> 10:19.160]  Saturday? Let's do it.
[10:19.260 --> 10:20.140]  Okay, let's do it.
[10:20.140 --> 10:21.520]  Oh, that's a nice bright window.
[10:21.840 --> 10:23.600]  Oh, lovely. Oh, you know what you could do?
[10:24.060 --> 10:30.520]  You could just pop that roller thing out and just put a darker one in, like a thicker one. You don't have to use any tools for that.
[10:30.860 --> 10:31.120]  Could I?
[10:31.120 --> 10:32.680]  Yeah, just measure the size.
[10:33.300 --> 10:38.060]  Oh, I'm not good at measuring. I'm a bad measuring person. I'm not a measuring guy.
[10:38.340 --> 10:41.080]  I'm really bad at guessing length of things.
[10:41.140 --> 10:42.560]  That's why you measure, you don't have to guess.
[10:42.700 --> 10:43.680]  I know, I don't trust myself.
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.080]  Measuring takes the guessing out. It's the anti-guessing.
[10:47.240 --> 10:50.240]  Measuring is the anti-guessing, dude. Come on.
[10:50.620 --> 10:56.740]  It's a tough thing, especially when dealing with people in other countries trying to explain things. It's very difficult. I'm not good at it.
[10:57.060 --> 10:59.920]  What, are you getting live advice from a foreign country while you're measuring?
[10:59.920 --> 11:09.100]  If I'm trying to explain to somebody how tall something is or long, I try to think of objects they would see.
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.620]  Or you could just use the measurement. You could just say 75 inches.
[11:13.980 --> 11:19.160]  Are you trying to relate? Are you talking to French people in baguettes? What do you mean?
[11:19.680 --> 11:25.000]  Okay, so one of the measurements... I don't know. Peter Dinklage is somebody I've used in the past.
[11:25.120 --> 11:25.900]  Come on.
[11:26.420 --> 11:27.660]  Yeah, just like a Dinklage.
[11:31.380 --> 11:36.760]  So, like, I learned a Dink... So, Peter Dinklage is 1.2 yards.
[11:37.220 --> 11:38.760]  So, like, whenever...
[11:38.760 --> 11:41.040]  Stop measuring people in yards!
[11:43.420 --> 11:48.180]  So, then... Well, no, it's just... Okay, so now I'm a big football... I love football.
[11:48.540 --> 11:55.460]  Every time it's, like, third and one now, in my head it's third and a Dinklage. And it's just... I don't know. It's a fun visual. They need to move the ball.
[11:55.460 --> 12:01.400]  But no one knows exactly how tall Peter Dinklage is just off in their head. Nobody has that information.
[12:01.840 --> 12:13.760]  No, but if somebody said, like, how tall is my mini-fridge, I'd assume it's about the same height as Peter Dinklage. And I don't know what the height of my fridge is, but I could say it's around the height of Peter Dinklage, and they would know because they've seen Peter Dinklage.
[12:13.840 --> 12:18.700]  I would love to see a measuring tape that just measures in Dinklages.
[12:20.320 --> 12:20.760]  Dinklages.
[12:21.080 --> 12:22.700]  Dinklages is my main measurement.
[12:22.700 --> 12:28.960]  That's easier than getting a tape measure. That's easier. Like, oh, Peter Dinklage, can you come over and stand under this cabinet?
[12:29.220 --> 12:33.840]  But if they don't know how long a foot is, what good is it even if I have the exact measurement?
[12:34.160 --> 12:35.360]  Because it's numbers!
[12:36.060 --> 12:40.980]  If I was asked, like, how tall is your house, you'd be like, it's one minute bowl of LeBron James and the Rockets.
[12:42.480 --> 12:51.380]  I would say it's probably, like, the third story of a hotel. Two stories of a hotel, maybe. I don't know. I'd compare it to, like, a thing that everyone's seen.
[12:51.380 --> 12:53.760]  I need to understand that in Dinklage. I'm sorry.
[12:54.840 --> 12:55.660]  I don't know.
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.160]  This is coming from the man who told me to put an eighth of a teaspoon of pineapple juice in my sauce last week.
[13:01.800 --> 13:03.660]  That was just me saying stuff.
[13:07.380 --> 13:09.100]  I'm not good at it. I'm not good at it.
[13:09.140 --> 13:16.240]  I like that you then went to actually put a value to Peter Dinklage in terms of measurement. And you did it in yards.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.880]  Well, because I was thinking within a football context when I was having this conversation of, like, if you were going to move the ball at Peter Dinklage, how far would it be?
[13:24.420 --> 13:27.760]  And it was 1.3 or 1.2 yards, I believe.
[13:28.640 --> 13:29.360]  Oh, man.
[13:29.560 --> 13:36.500]  Yeah, well, I understand the problem now. There's no easy solution for you to get blinds. It's just going to be bright for the rest of your life.
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.380]  Well, no, there are tons of solutions. They just require me to do some research, and I haven't done it yet.
[13:41.460 --> 13:44.940]  You're on the phone to Home Depot ordering a Dinklage of blinds.
[13:44.940 --> 13:47.940]  You're working in a vaccine lab or something. Oh, my God.
[13:48.160 --> 13:54.540]  No, I mean, all I need to do is cover my eyes with a pillow. That's my technique. I just bring the pillow over the face and we're fine. Darkens out the whole room.
[13:55.400 --> 14:01.280]  It's perfect. I can't see anything. It's comfy. I feel like I'm a little... I'm trapped a little bit. I'm a little enclosed. It's great.
[14:03.960 --> 14:07.140]  Oh, God damn. I did not expect to hear that today.
[14:07.760 --> 14:13.340]  No, we're just talking about distances. I used to think a foot was the size of my foot. I'd use my foot to measure feet.
[14:13.340 --> 14:16.320]  Not an accurate representation, although it might be.
[14:16.700 --> 14:19.300]  How many Dinklages per hour does a plane fly at?
[14:20.780 --> 14:25.700]  I haven't expanded beyond a football scenario, but that's a great question.
[14:26.060 --> 14:26.920]  You don't know DPH?
[14:27.700 --> 14:33.400]  No, I don't. I don't know Dinklage per hour. Dinklage per hour is not a measurement that I've tracked.
[14:33.800 --> 14:40.100]  Speaking of planes, that was a part of a clever segway. Speaking of planes, Geoff went on a plane somewhere. Geoff, what happened when you were there?
[14:44.080 --> 14:45.480]  Geoff, what a great segway.
[14:46.460 --> 14:51.460]  I had a fantastic vacation is what I tried.
[14:53.720 --> 14:54.440]  God damn.
[14:56.160 --> 14:59.800]  Well, let's start at the top. Man hands. Okay, so that's an insight.
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.400]  I went to this place in Mexico that I go.
[15:04.960 --> 15:05.780]  I'm just going to sit back.
[15:06.380 --> 15:13.280]  First trip out of the States in a while. And there's this little island. It's the easternmost point of Mexico. It's called Isla Mujeres.
[15:13.600 --> 15:17.880]  And I go there fairly regularly. I mean, not since the pandemic, obviously.
[15:18.560 --> 15:26.020]  So this is my first trip out. The girlfriend and I and two of our grown-up non-rooster-teeth friends, a couple, all went together.
[15:27.140 --> 15:29.820]  I met some other grown-up non-rooster-teeth friends.
[15:30.680 --> 15:31.920]  So it's like six couples.
[15:33.320 --> 15:39.460]  And anyway, so I went for a week. And it's a really cool little island. It's only about five miles long.
[15:39.820 --> 15:43.820]  And there's not really any cars on it. So when you get there, you have to take a ferry to get there.
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.480]  And when you get there, you rent a golf cart and you just drive around and swim and eat fun food.
[15:48.600 --> 15:51.800]  And it's just really charming and great and drive golf carts. It's awesome. It's fun.
[15:51.800 --> 15:55.800]  Anyway, so they have massages on the beach.
[15:56.240 --> 16:01.400]  And I try to get a massage every day while I'm there because they're super cheap and they're really good massages.
[16:01.960 --> 16:02.320]  Every day?
[16:02.860 --> 16:08.620]  Yeah, one a day. Go swimming in the morning. Eat some lunch at the beach. Go swim a little bit more.
[16:08.820 --> 16:12.460]  Then go get like a knockout, like an hour-long massage and then go back and get ready for dinner.
[16:12.960 --> 16:16.340]  But surely by like day five, you're like, OK, I've done this now.
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.700]  Well, trying to get one every day doesn't mean getting one every day.
[16:19.700 --> 16:22.440]  I would say in the six days I was there, I probably got four.
[16:23.080 --> 16:23.980]  That's still a lot.
[16:24.100 --> 16:24.300]  That's pretty good.
[16:24.860 --> 16:27.640]  Dude, it doesn't feel like a lot. I could have used another six or seven.
[16:28.740 --> 16:32.740]  A lot of stress in this body, buddy. It takes those people a while to work it out.
[16:32.860 --> 16:34.860]  Anyway, so I've been doing this for a long time.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.780]  It's like open air and it's breezy and you're like smelling the ocean and you've got the wind.
[16:38.820 --> 16:39.800]  It's just really relaxing.
[16:40.720 --> 16:51.680]  And I had something that came up that's just never come up before in my entire life, which is we roll up on the first day and it's Emily and I both get our massages and it's always two ladies.
[16:52.040 --> 16:54.140]  But this time it was a dude and a lady.
[16:54.320 --> 16:55.380]  And that's happened before, too.
[16:55.720 --> 17:02.480]  But always like and I don't I don't know if these are like unspoken rules or whatever, but the lady always massages me and the dude always massages Emily.
[17:02.620 --> 17:06.320]  Right. I've never been massaged by a guy before in my life.
[17:06.520 --> 17:08.420]  And this time the guy was like, let's go.
[17:08.420 --> 17:10.020]  So I'm like, OK, cool.
[17:10.140 --> 17:11.560]  I've never had a massage by a guy before.
[17:11.680 --> 17:13.400]  I wonder if it's any different at all.
[17:13.640 --> 17:21.920]  You know, so I lay down and we get to work and I realized that men are superior to women in every way.
[17:22.780 --> 17:25.280]  I melted in that man's hands.
[17:25.280 --> 17:37.320]  I felt I I was he worked out every sore muscle, every every ounce of stress in my entire body with his strong masculine hands.
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.060]  I was a puddle. I felt safe and secure.
[17:41.220 --> 17:43.220]  I was I don't want to leave that bed, dude.
[17:43.640 --> 17:45.600]  And I thought about that massage all night.
[17:45.680 --> 17:48.580]  And then the next day I went back and I was like, where's the guy?
[17:48.700 --> 17:50.420]  And he wasn't there, but there was a different guy.
[17:50.460 --> 17:51.600]  So I got the different guy.
[17:51.600 --> 17:57.480]  This is my insight. I'm never getting massaged by a woman with tiny woman hands ever again for the rest of my life.
[17:57.680 --> 17:59.060]  Sorry, women, I'm off limits.
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.620]  I only want beefy, strong sausage fingers dudes on me.
[18:03.760 --> 18:05.260]  It was amazing.
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.340]  And I recommend every dude go out and get a massage by a dude who's tougher than you immediately.
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.580]  So I guess two things immediately for me.
[18:13.760 --> 18:17.340]  I've never gotten a massage in my life, but I've known this to be a thing.
[18:17.340 --> 18:20.080]  You want the male massage.
[18:20.480 --> 18:21.540]  It's just it's a deeper.
[18:21.760 --> 18:23.540]  That's more strength, more hand strength.
[18:23.660 --> 18:24.640]  That's just the thing I know.
[18:24.680 --> 18:25.500]  So it's shocking to me.
[18:25.740 --> 18:28.280]  Sounds like you're a real massage enthusiast that you weren't aware of this.
[18:28.540 --> 18:30.760]  Second thing and most important detail.
[18:30.940 --> 18:33.500]  At what day did you get the massage from the guy?
[18:34.800 --> 18:36.660]  Oh, how many massages were you?
[18:36.840 --> 18:38.300]  It was the first massage.
[18:38.620 --> 18:39.640]  So it was on day two.
[18:39.720 --> 18:40.660]  I didn't get a massage day one.
[18:40.900 --> 18:45.140]  So this also explains Geoff's sudden pursuit of massages every single day.
[18:45.140 --> 18:47.240]  I feel like it increases the demand.
[18:48.120 --> 18:51.680]  He has seen the light and he now needs it as much as he possibly could get it.
[18:51.860 --> 18:53.200]  That's why you're going there every day.
[18:53.340 --> 18:54.400]  And I'll be honest.
[18:54.500 --> 18:58.100]  The second dude wasn't as good as the first dude, but he was still really good.
[18:58.320 --> 18:59.540]  And it was still amazing.
[18:59.700 --> 19:01.640]  But I still am thinking about the first guy a little bit.
[19:01.700 --> 19:03.180]  And I wish I could remember his name.
[19:03.260 --> 19:03.420]  Yeah.
[19:04.560 --> 19:05.780]  He rocked my world.
[19:06.400 --> 19:07.860]  And I'm not afraid to admit it.
[19:08.080 --> 19:11.680]  I'm sure you could just ask for a firmer massage from any woman.
[19:11.820 --> 19:13.220]  I've asked for firm massages.
[19:13.340 --> 19:14.100]  It's different.
[19:14.100 --> 19:16.500]  I'm telling you there's hand size.
[19:16.680 --> 19:17.500]  There's like this rock.
[19:17.600 --> 19:19.020]  I don't know how else to describe it.
[19:19.220 --> 19:20.940]  I've had a million massages in my life.
[19:21.020 --> 19:22.640]  I've had deep tissue massages.
[19:22.680 --> 19:23.900]  I've had therapeutic massages.
[19:23.980 --> 19:25.440]  I've had all kinds of different massages.
[19:25.700 --> 19:27.220]  It was just different.
[19:27.760 --> 19:32.700]  So are you telling me that if you went and got one this week, you got a woman masseuse.
[19:33.260 --> 19:34.440]  I guess that's redundant.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.680]  And then you ask for like as firm as she's got.
[19:37.880 --> 19:39.700]  Are you saying it wouldn't come close?
[19:40.080 --> 19:40.600]  I don't know.
[19:40.600 --> 19:44.560]  I'm just saying I've never experienced massages like the four, three.
[19:44.880 --> 19:46.300]  I got a woman the last day.
[19:46.380 --> 19:48.100]  So three of the four massages were men.
[19:48.200 --> 19:51.800]  And I've never experienced massages like the three that I got from men.
[19:51.880 --> 19:55.340]  I think there are obvious going to be exceptions to that example.
[19:56.240 --> 20:01.400]  But I think generally speaking, it's just, you know, guys would have more hand strength, I'd assume.
[20:01.720 --> 20:03.360]  I've had a few in my time.
[20:04.220 --> 20:05.200]  The same though.
[20:05.400 --> 20:07.120]  Always women.
[20:07.940 --> 20:09.080]  But I had one in Japan.
[20:09.540 --> 20:11.540]  And it was way too firm.
[20:12.600 --> 20:14.220]  She hurt me so much.
[20:14.800 --> 20:18.960]  I would have paid again at the end to have just gone back in time and not done it.
[20:19.180 --> 20:21.160]  Yeah, it wasn't about pain.
[20:21.360 --> 20:23.700]  It wasn't like, it was hard to scream.
[20:23.820 --> 20:26.940]  It's not like, there was just like a strength there.
[20:27.240 --> 20:29.180]  And I don't know how else to describe it.
[20:29.340 --> 20:31.920]  But I wasn't saying like the guy hurt me any more than the women do or anything.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.560]  I've had some painful massages from women.
[20:33.900 --> 20:36.820]  It was just like, just a different vibe with a dude.
[20:36.920 --> 20:37.400]  I don't know.
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.360]  But I'm into it.
[20:39.280 --> 20:39.660]  Interesting.
[20:40.540 --> 20:41.300]  Little revelation.
[20:41.860 --> 20:42.620]  Maybe I'll try it out.
[20:43.140 --> 20:44.660]  I recommend you do, my friend.
[20:45.060 --> 20:46.820]  Please give a scouting report back, Gavin.
[20:47.260 --> 20:50.140]  I'd love to, I can't, I'm too ticklish for massages.
[20:50.620 --> 20:51.700]  I'd love to get one, too ticklish.
[20:51.700 --> 20:53.120]  Ticklish? They're not like...
[20:53.120 --> 20:54.120]  Yeah, they're not tickling you, buddy.
[20:54.340 --> 20:56.840]  No, I'm super ticklish.
[20:56.980 --> 20:58.020]  Like, doesn't even matter.
[20:58.120 --> 20:59.020]  I don't trust myself.
[20:59.120 --> 21:00.520]  It would be a disaster.
[21:00.920 --> 21:04.800]  I wonder if they would charge you more though, because as you've once said, you're all back.
[21:05.420 --> 21:07.020]  So there potentially is more back.
[21:07.020 --> 21:11.400]  It would be exhausting for them, and it would be stressful for me trying not to laugh.
[21:11.500 --> 21:12.700]  It would be a terrible experience.
[21:13.620 --> 21:14.960]  Oh, Eric says Geoff is right.
[21:15.300 --> 21:16.060]  Oh, thanks, Eric.
[21:16.200 --> 21:16.660]  Appreciate it.
[21:16.780 --> 21:21.680]  You're right. I've had massages from both, and I prefer male masseuse.
[21:22.460 --> 21:24.420]  It's just, it's deeper.
[21:25.040 --> 21:27.200]  I feel like it's deeper tissue and a firmer hold.
[21:28.140 --> 21:29.160]  There's just something to it.
[21:29.160 --> 21:29.900]  It's way deeper.
[21:30.740 --> 21:31.460]  They're getting in there.
[21:32.280 --> 21:32.760]  The end.
[21:33.180 --> 21:35.100]  I'll say it like this.
[21:35.220 --> 21:36.880]  I've learned men know how to touch men.
[21:39.020 --> 21:40.840]  I'm just surprised Andrew's never got one.
[21:41.140 --> 21:42.260]  Oh, I'm too ticklish.
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.880]  He's never had an egg, and you're surprised he's never had a massage?
[21:49.440 --> 21:55.780]  I just feel like there are places where I'm ticklish, but during a massage, they're not tickling me.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.900]  Oh, you don't understand the level of ticklishness that I got going on over here.
[21:59.940 --> 22:00.960]  It is a real problem.
[22:01.080 --> 22:02.000]  I'm super ticklish.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.460]  And I just don't want to risk it.
[22:03.540 --> 22:05.980]  I don't want to roll those dice because it would just be a nightmare.
[22:06.360 --> 22:08.480]  Your body is just so unbalanced by the sounds of it.
[22:08.500 --> 22:11.920]  You've got the strongest nose in the world, but the most ticklish back.
[22:12.500 --> 22:12.600]  Yeah.
[22:13.240 --> 22:14.080]  You're just lopsided.
[22:14.640 --> 22:15.260]  Ticklish everywhere.
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.560]  So is your nose ticklish?
[22:17.120 --> 22:18.040]  I bet you, you know what?
[22:18.100 --> 22:24.440]  If you got someone in there who knew what they were doing in the tickling game, I'd probably laugh.
[22:24.540 --> 22:25.660]  Yeah, it'd probably tickle.
[22:25.680 --> 22:26.720]  What does that mean?
[22:27.400 --> 22:28.100]  I don't know.
[22:28.100 --> 22:35.540]  I'm saying I don't know the nose tickling technique, but if you get a real tickling enthusiast in there that knows their way around, I'm sure they'd get me.
[22:35.760 --> 22:36.360]  But that's the whole point.
[22:37.840 --> 22:41.480]  The masseurs and masseuses aren't going to tickle you.
[22:41.820 --> 22:43.120]  No, but it's a mental thing.
[22:43.240 --> 22:44.740]  It's just something about the process.
[22:44.820 --> 22:45.260]  I don't know.
[22:45.380 --> 22:46.000]  I'm super ticklish.
[22:46.160 --> 22:51.540]  It's more of a paranoia thing, too, of if I don't want to risk that, what if I am ticklish in that way?
[22:51.760 --> 22:52.640]  Because then what do I do?
[22:52.940 --> 22:54.340]  It's just a terrible scenario.
[22:55.120 --> 22:55.420]  All right.
[22:56.200 --> 23:06.790]  We all shop online, and we've all seen that promo code field taunt us at checkout.
[23:07.450 --> 23:09.350]  Enter me in for a discount.
[23:09.670 --> 23:10.890]  What? You don't have a discount?
[23:11.070 --> 23:12.750]  You don't know anybody who hands out discounts?
[23:13.190 --> 23:13.710]  Sorry.
[23:14.310 --> 23:23.070]  Not anymore, though, because thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes or waiting for some coupon fairy to give them to you is a thing of the past.
[23:23.070 --> 23:30.830]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[23:31.310 --> 23:43.110]  Honey supports over 30,000 stores online, which range from sites that have tech or gaming products to fashion brands or food delivery or, in my case, it was a stand-up paddle board recently.
[23:43.690 --> 23:44.450]  You get the idea.
[23:44.810 --> 23:46.330]  Tons and tons of variety.
[23:46.730 --> 23:47.290]  Here's how it works.
[23:47.290 --> 23:54.350]  Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites, and when you go to checkout, the Honey button drops down, and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.
[23:54.670 --> 23:55.650]  You wait a couple seconds.
[23:56.050 --> 24:00.950]  Honey searches for coupons all around the internet and probably some secret internets and maybe some space internets.
[24:01.230 --> 24:05.950]  Then, if it finds a working coupon, it'll apply, and you will watch the prices drop.
[24:07.830 --> 24:08.270]  Blooooom.
[24:08.290 --> 24:08.590]  Bah.
[24:10.030 --> 24:10.470]  Savings.
[24:11.190 --> 24:17.050]  Honey saved us, I don't remember now, but it was a pretty significant amount on two stand-up paddle boards that we bought.
[24:17.470 --> 24:21.670]  And my girlfriend, she's a big honey-er, and I was about to hit the button and she was like,
[24:21.730 --> 24:23.370]  No, use Honey, remember? And I was like, Oh, right.
[24:23.830 --> 24:26.290]  And so I did, and we saved a ton of money.
[24:26.610 --> 24:33.770]  And it's not just us. Honey has found its over 17 million members, more than $2 billion in savings.
[24:34.330 --> 24:39.070]  So if you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up missing out on free savings.
[24:39.070 --> 24:41.790]  It is literally free and installs in a few seconds.
[24:41.950 --> 24:46.230]  And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid and supporting this podcast.
[24:46.570 --> 24:51.890]  I'd never recommend something I don't use. Get Honey for free at joinhoney.com.

[26:18.050 --> 26:19.810]  I know it's August, but the summer is not over.
[26:19.890 --> 26:24.210]  It's hotter than ever. And when it's hot, people want to eat sizzling meat.
[26:24.210 --> 26:27.910]  They have grilling bundles, they have burger packs, and surf and turf packs.

[26:51.810 --> 26:53.110]  So that's manhands.
[26:53.350 --> 26:54.210]  Alright, that's manhands.
[26:54.510 --> 26:55.990]  The next one is open water.
[26:56.390 --> 26:59.390]  Now, this is the big one.
[26:59.550 --> 27:00.790]  This one and Purple Nightmare are the big ones.
[27:00.850 --> 27:03.030]  I think we may have to wait till next episode for Purple Nightmare, though.
[27:03.410 --> 27:05.070]  Alright, I'm going to start this with a preface.
[27:05.230 --> 27:19.270]  I'm going to preface this by saying I am still reeling a little bit from how poorly I told the horse story and have received a lot of criticism in my personal life from people about it that are more familiar with the story.
[27:19.270 --> 27:25.770]  And I feel a particular fear in regards to this story because it's not just my story.
[27:25.870 --> 27:28.390]  I was one of four people that experienced this hell.
[27:29.430 --> 27:30.950]  So would you want to write it out?
[27:31.430 --> 27:32.530]  No, I have notes.
[27:32.910 --> 27:37.750]  I apologize in advance to Emily and Joey and Tamara if I don't do the story justice.
[27:37.750 --> 27:38.910]  I am really sorry.
[27:39.430 --> 27:40.250]  It's a lot.
[27:40.330 --> 27:41.610]  It's a mouthful.
[27:41.730 --> 27:42.630]  It's a lot to figure out.
[27:42.690 --> 27:45.850]  And everybody, because I've heard the story repeated about a hundred times over the last week.
[27:46.550 --> 27:49.270]  Everybody has different parts that matter to them, right?
[27:49.550 --> 27:54.470]  And so if I don't cover the part that matters to you the most, I apologize, but it wasn't the part that mattered to me the most.
[27:54.730 --> 27:58.510]  Okay, so for the sake of your storytelling, do you want us just to listen instead of ask questions?
[27:58.690 --> 27:59.610]  No, no, you can ask questions.
[27:59.710 --> 27:59.870]  It's fine.
[28:00.010 --> 28:00.830]  Let's just do this like normal.
[28:01.030 --> 28:01.110]  Alright.
[28:01.210 --> 28:01.430]  Okay.
[28:03.290 --> 28:12.410]  Now, while we... well, first off, let me say, I would like to tell you, I had... I woke up with a nightmare the night before this happened.
[28:12.730 --> 28:14.370]  And I had a conversation with Emily.
[28:14.370 --> 28:20.050]  I can't tell you what that conversation is yet, because it'll spoil the story, but I'll tell you at the end.
[28:20.070 --> 28:21.630]  If you remind me, I'll come back to it.
[28:21.690 --> 28:21.810]  Okay?
[28:22.370 --> 28:23.190]  It's nonlinear.
[28:23.390 --> 28:24.070]  It's nonlinear.
[28:24.250 --> 28:28.530]  While we were in Mexico, we wanted to... we decided to go snorkeling.
[28:29.190 --> 28:32.950]  I will also say that I have been snorkeling quite a few times in my life.
[28:33.050 --> 28:34.970]  Been snorkeling in the ocean a few times.
[28:35.050 --> 28:39.430]  Been snorkeling at this very island, Isla Mujeres, before.
[28:40.010 --> 28:46.690]  Consider myself familiar with snorkeling as a concept, and fairly experienced in it.
[28:46.850 --> 28:54.430]  So, previously I had snorkeled, we'd done some reefs, like a reef, and we'd done an underwater museum that they have out there that's really cool.
[28:55.070 --> 29:00.230]  And this time, there were a lot of advertisements to go snorkeling with whale sharks.
[29:00.910 --> 29:03.930]  So we started to look into it, and it seemed like this really cool opportunity.
[29:03.930 --> 29:06.790]  I guess once a year, whale sharks come.
[29:06.890 --> 29:10.090]  They typically live, I don't know, a couple hundred feet below water.
[29:10.250 --> 29:12.550]  They're sharks, not whales, so they don't have to come up for oxygen.
[29:13.410 --> 29:19.370]  And they have giant mouths, but their mouths don't open, they can't have teeth, so they can only eat plankton, so they're not dangerous, right?
[29:19.690 --> 29:29.010]  And about once a year, they will come up at this spot in the ocean where the Gulf Coast and the, I guess, the Pacific Ocean or Atlantic Ocean meet.
[29:29.530 --> 29:30.490]  Or the oceans off Mexico.
[29:31.130 --> 29:37.230]  And I guess it's like a feeding frenzy for them, and there'll be hundreds out there eating at the surface, and manta rays, too.
[29:37.810 --> 29:45.730]  And supposedly, it's a really cool, unique thing, and so there were a lot of advertisements to go snorkeling with the whale sharks.
[29:45.910 --> 29:51.550]  And we had had such a positive experience snorkeling there previously that we were like, hey, let's do that.
[29:51.650 --> 29:52.270]  Let's all do that.
[29:52.390 --> 29:54.810]  And so the whole big group of us were gonna go.
[29:54.910 --> 29:58.010]  Two people backed out, so it ended up just being me and Emily and our other two friends.
[29:58.630 --> 30:06.250]  The thing I liked about it is that it's like a weird thing to go snorkeling with animals, and I was a little worried about, like, is this appropriate?
[30:06.710 --> 30:10.410]  And they were like, yeah, it's really ecologically-minded.
[30:10.910 --> 30:19.290]  They wouldn't let us wear sunscreen at all because the sunscreen could irritate or affect the food or the whale sharks in some negative way.
[30:19.370 --> 30:27.990]  So we had to go out and buy full-body wetsuit kind of deals because it was like 1,000 degrees in the sun, and it's like a four-hour tour, right?
[30:28.590 --> 30:30.610]  Very similar to Gilligan's Island.
[30:31.170 --> 30:36.250]  So we get there, and this lady comes out, the lady who we bought the tour from.
[30:36.370 --> 30:39.950]  We're sitting on the, like, right on the beach there, right in front of the boat.
[30:40.290 --> 30:42.790]  And she comes up, and we talked to her for about 15 minutes.
[30:42.930 --> 30:45.450]  She gives us the rundown, and we're like, all right, let's get to it.
[30:45.470 --> 30:47.970]  And she goes, oh, oh, yeah, no, let me introduce you to the captain.
[30:48.170 --> 30:49.870]  I'm not the one that does it.
[30:49.890 --> 30:50.570]  I just coordinate it.
[30:50.590 --> 30:51.350]  And we're like, oh, okay.
[30:51.610 --> 30:57.970]  So then this captain comes out, and he gives us a spiel about, like, he's really funny and engaging, and he's really well-versed.
[30:57.970 --> 31:01.710]  And they explain to us that it's, you know, we're in their territory, so we have to be respectful.
[31:01.790 --> 31:07.110]  And he explains, like, all the different scenarios where we could annoy a whale shark and how to avoid it.
[31:07.530 --> 31:14.310]  You know, he's got all these little funny clips, like, quips, like, you know how, like, when you're eating at a picnic and flies are buzzing around while you're trying to eat your lunch?
[31:14.410 --> 31:16.110]  Well, you're the flies, so be respectful.
[31:16.910 --> 31:17.610]  Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[31:17.770 --> 31:19.090]  And it's all really good information.
[31:19.270 --> 31:22.570]  And we can only go in, like, two people at a time.
[31:22.570 --> 31:27.890]  So, like, you know, the other couple will go in, and when they come out, we'll go in, because we don't want to overwhelm the whale sharks.
[31:28.350 --> 31:32.930]  It's all designed with being really respectful to the whale sharks and their environment, which I think is pretty cool.
[31:33.650 --> 31:35.470]  And so he's like, all right, you guys ready?
[31:35.570 --> 31:36.390]  And we're like, yeah, let's go.
[31:36.530 --> 31:38.590]  And then we're like, point us to the boat.
[31:38.730 --> 31:40.410]  And he goes, oh, no, no, I'm not taking you.
[31:40.610 --> 31:41.930]  These other guys are taking you.
[31:42.030 --> 31:43.870]  And at this point, I think, well, that's a little weird.
[31:44.210 --> 31:45.270]  I'm on my third person.
[31:45.470 --> 31:49.050]  And surely, at some point, I'm going to talk to the person that's going to take us out, right?
[31:49.050 --> 31:51.890]  So he takes us out to this... he actually just points to the boat.
[31:52.190 --> 31:57.710]  And we go out there, and there's these two dudes on it, like a captain and, like, a diver dude, right?
[31:57.950 --> 31:59.170]  But was the first guy a captain?
[31:59.610 --> 32:01.570]  He was, like, the head of the company, I guess.
[32:01.610 --> 32:02.550]  He was a captain, yeah.
[32:03.050 --> 32:08.670]  So anyway, these guys, we get there, we get on the boat, and it becomes apparent these guys don't speak a lot of English.
[32:09.030 --> 32:10.110]  And, you know, why would they?
[32:10.230 --> 32:12.770]  They're Hispanic, and they're in Mexico, right?
[32:13.010 --> 32:18.230]  And so there's a bit of a language barrier at the get-go, which is fine, you know?
[32:18.230 --> 32:19.950]  We make it work. No big deal.
[32:20.570 --> 32:23.350]  So we get in the boat, and it's, you know, it's not a big boat.
[32:23.430 --> 32:25.290]  It's like one of those little boats you'd see off the coast.
[32:25.710 --> 32:30.270]  I don't know a lot about boats, but it's got two little twin Yamaha 150 engines on the back.
[32:30.370 --> 32:33.250]  That's very important, two twin Yamaha 150 engines.
[32:33.530 --> 32:34.910]  Boy, does that become a big deal.
[32:36.510 --> 32:38.990]  And, you know, it's one of those boats that probably holds about 12 people.
[32:39.130 --> 32:40.450]  It's just seats all the way around.
[32:40.590 --> 32:44.810]  It's not super fast, and it's covered with, like, a tarp at the top, you know, like a nice tarp.
[32:45.270 --> 32:47.690]  And so they're like, okay.
[32:48.330 --> 32:57.890]  Oh, by the way, I should mention, one thing that gave me pause is in the previous instructions from the first captain, who I thought was going to be taking us out,
[32:57.990 --> 33:02.990]  he mentioned that we were going about 50 miles off the coast in open ocean.
[33:03.210 --> 33:03.930]  Jesus. Wow.
[33:04.010 --> 33:08.510]  Yeah. 50 miles into the ocean.
[33:10.210 --> 33:11.090]  50 miles.
[33:11.310 --> 33:14.390]  And I thought, that's a lot further than I thought it would be.
[33:14.390 --> 33:17.190]  And he goes, yeah, it's going to take about 45 minutes to get out there.
[33:17.290 --> 33:20.830]  It takes about 45 minutes in these little boats to get to go 50 miles.
[33:20.970 --> 33:21.790]  That's a fast boat.
[33:22.170 --> 33:25.330]  Yeah. And like 40, 45, 50 miles somewhere.
[33:25.430 --> 33:27.730]  It's like it's it's not an exact science, right?
[33:27.750 --> 33:29.570]  It's like wherever the whale sharks are that day.
[33:29.590 --> 33:36.870]  But it's, you know, he said it's about, you know, 70 to 85 kilometers or so, which I in my head is about 45 to 50 miles.
[33:36.870 --> 33:39.550]  Right. I think anyway, it's pretty fucking far out there.
[33:39.710 --> 33:43.370]  So we hop in the boat and I'm not I don't get seasick.
[33:43.370 --> 33:45.070]  I'm not uneasy about this.
[33:45.170 --> 33:51.370]  I've been whale watching before the whole thing, but they recommend we take Dramamine for nausea.
[33:51.950 --> 33:53.170]  And so I'm like, fuck it, I will.
[33:53.330 --> 33:54.070]  Yeah. Like, why not?
[33:54.170 --> 33:55.350]  You know, why, why, why tempt fate?
[33:55.430 --> 33:56.710]  So I take we all take our Dramamine.
[33:57.290 --> 33:59.230]  Not that I think it's going to be an issue at all.
[33:59.610 --> 34:02.790]  Then we take off and we we start to go.
[34:02.930 --> 34:08.510]  And after about, I don't know, 15 minutes or so, I realize we're we're not going really fast.
[34:09.250 --> 34:17.270]  And I look over and the the guy is like fucking with the with the controls, trying to get one of the like one of the engines is pegged.
[34:17.370 --> 34:21.870]  And the other one is just like going back and forth and trying to and the other guys back there kind of kicking it and looking at it.
[34:22.030 --> 34:24.990]  And we realize they start screwing.
[34:25.030 --> 34:25.930]  We slow down.
[34:26.230 --> 34:30.490]  And I'll say if we were going in fifth gear, like if this was a car, we're going in like third gear now.
[34:31.490 --> 34:33.770]  And they're like speaking to each other.
[34:33.770 --> 34:35.030]  And I can't quite understand it.
[34:35.050 --> 34:35.870]  They seem agitated.
[34:36.190 --> 34:37.590]  The vibe starts to shift.
[34:38.150 --> 34:41.990]  I'll say that the vibe, it just doesn't seem as pleasant as it was.
[34:42.310 --> 34:45.230]  And there is obviously a problem with one of the engines.
[34:45.850 --> 34:46.990]  I can still see land.
[34:47.210 --> 34:49.050]  We're like I said 15 minutes out.
[34:49.110 --> 34:50.070]  We're like maybe 10 minutes out.
[34:50.150 --> 34:51.050]  I can still see land.
[34:51.350 --> 34:53.130]  So I'm kind of not too worried.
[34:53.190 --> 34:54.750]  But I'm also like, well, we can just go back.
[34:55.030 --> 34:57.890]  And they're like, they kind of wave us off.
[34:58.050 --> 35:04.670]  We're like, do we need to, you know, and they go back there and he's like kicking the engine and he's like working on it.
[35:04.670 --> 35:05.510]  And we just keep going.
[35:05.510 --> 35:08.650]  The other guy just goes forward with one engine while the other guy tries to fix the first engine.
[35:09.290 --> 35:10.910]  Eventually, he gives up.
[35:11.050 --> 35:12.710]  And we just go forward with one engine.
[35:12.890 --> 35:16.090]  At this point, we're 30, 40 minutes out.
[35:16.210 --> 35:21.910]  And I'm like, oh, well, we've only got about 10 minutes before we'll be at the whale sharks, right?
[35:22.270 --> 35:27.270]  But I start to notice that boats come by and they're passing us like we're sitting still.
[35:27.850 --> 35:32.950]  And I realize they're going way, way, way faster than us because they're in fifth gear because both of their engines work.
[35:32.950 --> 35:35.810]  We're going like third on one engine.
[35:36.970 --> 35:40.010]  And it's starting to get real bumpy in third gear.
[35:40.530 --> 35:43.230]  When you're going in fifth gear, you're cutting right through those waves.
[35:43.670 --> 35:45.470]  When you're going in third gear, you are not.
[35:45.670 --> 35:52.870]  We are getting kind of battered around like I'm starting to get a bruise on the back of my lower back from getting slammed into the back of the boat over and over again.
[35:53.070 --> 35:56.310]  And we're not like nauseous or anything, but it's not pleasant.
[35:56.510 --> 35:56.790]  Right?
[35:57.290 --> 35:58.090]  We do that.
[35:58.610 --> 36:03.130]  The 45 minute ride out to the whale sharks ended up being a little over an hour and a half.
[36:03.730 --> 36:06.050]  By the time we roll up, I see the boats out there.
[36:06.410 --> 36:08.310]  We're all feeling pretty, pretty worn out.
[36:08.490 --> 36:19.170]  Like it's been a long hour and a half getting blasted in the sun with no sunscreen, getting jostled around, going like we're bobbing like fucking motherfuckers because we're not going that fast.
[36:19.930 --> 36:21.130]  We get out there.
[36:22.030 --> 36:25.030]  And first off, I thought this was going to be this intimate experience.
[36:25.030 --> 36:26.790]  There's 40 boats in the water.
[36:27.010 --> 36:30.650]  And I don't know how they're not slamming into each other because this is open fucking ocean.
[36:30.870 --> 36:34.010]  Like I haven't seen land in an hour at this point.
[36:34.390 --> 36:35.410]  We are so far out there.
[36:35.570 --> 36:38.450]  And I discover I'm not super cool with that.
[36:38.610 --> 36:39.930]  Like I'm okay with it.
[36:40.650 --> 36:47.290]  Obviously we're safe, but it's weird to be in that small of a boat that far away from land.
[36:49.950 --> 36:51.930]  So there's all these boats like floating around.
[36:52.350 --> 36:56.550]  And I notice that on every boat, two or three people are hanging off the boat just throwing up.
[36:57.010 --> 37:01.330]  Like I'm probably watching 20 people puke at the same time.
[37:01.550 --> 37:05.310]  I like that there's no sunscreen, but you're allowed to just vomit all over the place.
[37:05.310 --> 37:07.750]  I don't think they had a choice, dude.
[37:08.010 --> 37:09.810]  There's no way to hold it in, right?
[37:10.310 --> 37:13.510]  And so the waves are fucking huge too here.
[37:13.790 --> 37:15.710]  And then the guy comes over and he gives...
[37:15.710 --> 37:17.170]  It's not even a discussion of who's getting in the water yet.
[37:17.210 --> 37:18.670]  He just gives Emily and I flippers.
[37:18.950 --> 37:21.770]  And we brought our own snorkels because we thought that'd be the safest with COVID and stuff.
[37:22.290 --> 37:24.530]  And so the guy goes, hey, put these on.
[37:24.690 --> 37:26.570]  And so we're like, I'm like putting them on.
[37:26.570 --> 37:28.050]  And she's like putting hers on.
[37:28.230 --> 37:32.010]  And before the guy had given us the spiel, the first captain had given a spiel.
[37:32.050 --> 37:33.890]  When you get in the water, just look straight down.
[37:34.150 --> 37:36.250]  Just look straight down. There's no whales above you.
[37:36.470 --> 37:37.810]  The whale sharks are going to be below you.
[37:38.290 --> 37:44.870]  But you also need to keep in mind where the boat is, where the diver is, and where your partner is at all times.
[37:44.870 --> 37:46.330]  But also don't look up. Only look down.
[37:46.570 --> 37:48.450]  And I'm like, well, that seems complicated.
[37:49.290 --> 37:51.490]  And I'm interested to see how that's going to work in practice.
[37:51.730 --> 37:53.030]  So anyway, he gives us these.
[37:53.150 --> 37:55.730]  I'm starting to just like casually put a thing on.
[37:55.910 --> 37:59.190]  And then the guy screams, go, go now, go now, go, go now.
[37:59.550 --> 38:00.850]  And Emily and I are like, what, what?
[38:00.910 --> 38:01.910]  And we're not even sure if it's us.
[38:01.930 --> 38:03.890]  And he's just pointing at us going, go now, go now.
[38:04.190 --> 38:08.610]  And then he goes over and he points to him and he jumps in the water like we're supposed to do.
[38:08.710 --> 38:09.610]  And we're like, uh-uh.
[38:09.730 --> 38:10.950]  And the other guy's like, go now.
[38:11.170 --> 38:11.990]  And we're like, uh-uh.
[38:12.070 --> 38:14.150]  And so we're like putting our flippers on.
[38:14.150 --> 38:16.510]  And we just jump into the water, right?
[38:16.830 --> 38:21.690]  Jump into a huge roiling ocean full of people and waves and boats.
[38:22.130 --> 38:24.610]  And my snorkel flies off.
[38:24.870 --> 38:28.250]  One of my fins flies off my foot.
[38:28.570 --> 38:31.970]  And so I'm like in open ocean trying to put my fucking fin back on.
[38:32.190 --> 38:34.830]  And trying to fit my snorkel on while I'm bouncing around.
[38:35.430 --> 38:38.490]  And like a wave will come up and I can't see anything.
[38:38.670 --> 38:40.270]  It's just, I can't see anybody.
[38:40.390 --> 38:41.330]  And then the wave will crash back down.
[38:41.510 --> 38:43.370]  And I'll suddenly see 40 boats and 100 people.
[38:43.370 --> 38:44.490]  And it's fucking scary.
[38:44.630 --> 38:45.510]  And I'm like looking around.
[38:45.710 --> 38:48.330]  So I just start looking in the ocean.
[38:48.690 --> 38:49.770]  And all I just see is blue.
[38:49.910 --> 38:51.750]  Just like hundreds of feet of blue and nothing.
[38:52.070 --> 38:53.290]  It's the scariest thing I've ever seen.
[38:53.610 --> 38:54.730]  And I'm like, where are these fucking whale sharks?
[38:55.070 --> 38:56.310]  But then I'm like, oh, I gotta look at Emily.
[38:56.410 --> 38:57.310]  I gotta look at the guy, right?
[38:57.330 --> 38:58.810]  So I look up and Emily's over there.
[38:58.870 --> 39:00.530]  So I try to grab her hand and she grabs mine.
[39:00.750 --> 39:02.150]  And then the guy's like, hi!
[39:02.370 --> 39:03.050]  And he's like yelling at me.
[39:03.070 --> 39:03.930]  And I'm like, oh, fuck what?
[39:04.150 --> 39:04.970]  And I don't understand what he's saying.
[39:05.010 --> 39:05.410]  He's like, hi!
[39:05.450 --> 39:06.170]  And he just starts pointing.
[39:06.270 --> 39:06.870]  He's like, follow, follow.
[39:06.970 --> 39:07.390]  And I'm like, oh.
[39:07.450 --> 39:08.510]  So I just start swimming.
[39:08.510 --> 39:11.270]  And then he's like, get on the boat!
[39:11.450 --> 39:12.330]  And I'm like, oh, okay.
[39:12.490 --> 39:14.730]  So then we're trying to get on the fucking boat.
[39:15.150 --> 39:16.190]  And the waves are crashing.
[39:16.290 --> 39:18.250]  I'm slammed against the side of the fucking boat.
[39:18.530 --> 39:19.810]  And I eventually climb up the ladder.
[39:20.050 --> 39:21.010]  And by the time I get back on the ladder,
[39:21.070 --> 39:23.390]  we've been in the water for 45 seconds to a minute.
[39:23.470 --> 39:24.450]  Maybe I'm exhausted.
[39:24.810 --> 39:26.110]  Emily looks like she just...
[39:26.110 --> 39:27.990]  Emily looks like she is fucking done.
[39:28.230 --> 39:29.770]  And we're both like, what the fuck was that?
[39:29.930 --> 39:31.490]  And then I just hear chatter over the radio going,
[39:31.550 --> 39:33.050]  no whales, no whale sharks, no whale sharks.
[39:33.330 --> 39:34.050]  And then we just start...
[39:34.050 --> 39:35.090]  And the guy's like, no sharks here.
[39:35.330 --> 39:36.390]  And then we just take off.
[39:36.610 --> 39:38.250]  And I'm like, what the fuck?
[39:38.710 --> 39:40.410]  And I look at Emily and she goes...
[39:40.410 --> 39:41.690]  I look at Emily and she goes,
[39:42.070 --> 39:43.110]  I'm not getting back in the water.
[39:43.250 --> 39:44.770]  And I go, yeah, I know.
[39:45.850 --> 39:47.290]  They'll go next. They'll go next.
[39:47.570 --> 39:48.850]  And then we just start going.
[39:49.030 --> 39:51.270]  And we're just leaving all these other boats behind.
[39:51.390 --> 39:52.430]  And that actually scares me
[39:52.430 --> 39:53.610]  because we're going off on our own.
[39:53.790 --> 39:55.490]  And all I can hear is chatter over the radio
[39:55.490 --> 39:57.130]  of them saying like, no whale sharks here, whatever.
[39:57.610 --> 39:59.590]  So like, we're going to another location, right?
[39:59.630 --> 40:01.070]  But we're going in third gear again.
[40:01.110 --> 40:02.010]  And we're going slow.
[40:02.110 --> 40:04.150]  And at this point, the dip into the...
[40:04.150 --> 40:06.610]  the terrifying dip into the open ocean
[40:06.610 --> 40:08.990]  and then getting slammed around
[40:08.990 --> 40:10.610]  and then slammed into the boat
[40:10.610 --> 40:11.490]  and then back up in.
[40:12.210 --> 40:15.010]  I'm... I'm starting to get a little...
[40:15.010 --> 40:16.610]  a little seasick at this point.
[40:16.990 --> 40:19.010]  And we go for...
[40:19.010 --> 40:20.610]  I want to say another...
[40:22.270 --> 40:22.750]  oh...
[40:22.750 --> 40:25.350]  30 or 40 minutes
[40:25.350 --> 40:27.150]  further out into the ocean.
[40:27.370 --> 40:28.890]  And eventually...
[40:29.410 --> 40:31.470]  I'm starting to wonder if these guys are just taking us out to dump us
[40:31.470 --> 40:33.490]  because there's nobody around and it's scary
[40:33.490 --> 40:35.310]  and there's no communication
[40:35.310 --> 40:36.850]  and they're...
[40:36.850 --> 40:39.670]  I can tell these guys are getting more stressed by the boat.
[40:39.890 --> 40:40.830]  Oh, I should also point out,
[40:41.050 --> 40:42.850]  I'm starting to smell a lot...
[40:42.850 --> 40:44.730]  when we got into the water and we came back into the back of the boat,
[40:44.790 --> 40:46.130]  we're smelling a ton of gasoline.
[40:46.490 --> 40:49.750]  Like, it's a very intense smell of gasoline at the back of the boat.
[40:49.850 --> 40:51.130]  And Emily and I are like, this is not good.
[40:51.490 --> 40:52.370]  I have a question.
[40:52.490 --> 40:55.610]  At this point in the story, am I supposed to know what the hell happened back there?
[40:56.170 --> 40:57.050]  Uh, back where?
[40:57.270 --> 40:57.970]  At the back of the boat?
[40:57.990 --> 41:01.170]  Like, go now and get in the boat?
[41:01.330 --> 41:03.250]  No, you don't know anything more than I do, dude.
[41:03.250 --> 41:05.270]  They told us that we go to the spot
[41:05.890 --> 41:07.130]  where the whale sharks are,
[41:07.590 --> 41:09.270]  they scream at us to jump in,
[41:09.330 --> 41:11.470]  we jump in, then they scream at us to get out,
[41:11.650 --> 41:12.890]  and then we just take off.
[41:12.990 --> 41:14.510]  And they're like, there were no whale sharks there.
[41:14.810 --> 41:16.790]  And then eventually, in that 30 minutes,
[41:16.970 --> 41:19.410]  boats start slamming past us again like we're standing still.
[41:19.590 --> 41:20.770]  We get to another location,
[41:20.890 --> 41:21.990]  this time there's about 20 boats.
[41:22.270 --> 41:23.370]  The whole thing happens again.
[41:24.110 --> 41:26.190]  They throw the stuff at Joey and Tamara.
[41:26.730 --> 41:27.690]  They're like, you guys get ready.
[41:28.270 --> 41:30.950]  I should also point out at some point that this is supposed to be a
[41:30.950 --> 41:32.630]  luncheon ceviche, where they
[41:32.630 --> 41:34.910]  prepare ceviche live in front of you
[41:34.910 --> 41:36.350]  and they have gourmet sandwiches and shit.
[41:36.930 --> 41:38.610]  Not that I'm hungry at this point.
[41:39.130 --> 41:40.370]  But other people are.
[41:40.930 --> 41:42.730]  And we get out there
[41:42.730 --> 41:44.850]  and it's
[41:44.850 --> 41:46.930]  even worse there. And there's less boats there.
[41:47.570 --> 41:49.050]  And it's like, the waves are even worse
[41:49.050 --> 41:50.630]  and there's just no whale sharks.
[41:50.870 --> 41:52.430]  And they're like, no sharks here, we go again.
[41:53.270 --> 41:54.970]  And I think Tamara
[41:54.970 --> 41:56.810]  goes, no, no, that's enough.
[41:57.070 --> 41:58.470]  No, we're not going to another location.
[41:58.470 --> 42:00.550]  We're good. Just take
[42:00.550 --> 42:01.650]  us back. We're done.
[42:01.950 --> 42:04.650]  We're two and a half hours into this. We've been getting slammed
[42:04.650 --> 42:06.470]  left and right. I'm fucking
[42:06.470 --> 42:08.170]  not feeling well. Emily looks
[42:08.170 --> 42:10.530]  like she's feeling terribly. Joey seems
[42:10.530 --> 42:12.610]  fine. He owns a boat.
[42:12.810 --> 42:14.050]  And the other girl, Tamara,
[42:14.270 --> 42:15.990]  she lived on a yacht for
[42:15.990 --> 42:18.550]  a sailboat for a couple years. Not a yacht, but a
[42:18.550 --> 42:20.710]  sailboat for a couple years. So they're well-versed
[42:20.710 --> 42:22.510]  sea people. And Joey's fine. Tamara looks
[42:22.510 --> 42:23.630]  like she's not feeling great either.
[42:24.730 --> 42:26.490]  He kind of shrugs and is like,
[42:26.490 --> 42:28.110]  OK, so we turn around and we just start heading.
[42:28.330 --> 42:29.770]  We think back. We're looking
[42:29.770 --> 42:32.430]  on a compass on our phone like, yeah, we're headed towards land.
[42:32.510 --> 42:34.010]  I guess this is the way. And
[42:34.010 --> 42:35.830]  we just start going a little bit slower
[42:35.830 --> 42:38.410]  and a little bit slower. And at some point, they throw
[42:38.410 --> 42:40.430]  sandwiches at us. And I open mine up
[42:40.430 --> 42:42.210]  and it's just two pieces
[42:42.210 --> 42:43.770]  of white bread
[42:43.770 --> 42:45.770]  as it was described.
[42:46.290 --> 42:48.490]  It was one slice of ham
[42:48.890 --> 42:49.770]  sliced on a one.
[42:50.370 --> 42:52.330]  You could see through it. And there's just
[42:52.330 --> 42:54.250]  a shitload of mayonnaise. So the mayonnaise was a
[42:54.250 --> 42:56.130]  non-starter for me, right? So I'm like,
[42:56.190 --> 42:58.290]  well, I'm not going to do that. And then I see the ceviche.
[42:58.590 --> 43:00.230]  It's literally a five-gallon
[43:01.090 --> 43:01.730]  Home Depot
[43:02.610 --> 43:04.030]  bucket just full of shrimp.
[43:04.450 --> 43:06.270]  And I'm like, eh, it doesn't look appetizing either.
[43:06.350 --> 43:07.810]  Just open shrimp in a
[43:07.810 --> 43:10.070]  five-gallon bucket. So I'm like, clearly
[43:10.070 --> 43:11.070]  I'm not eating on this trip.
[43:11.910 --> 43:13.450]  But I'm not super hungry anyway.
[43:14.210 --> 43:16.390]  It's like bread in a bucket of chum.
[43:16.690 --> 43:17.990]  Yeah, bread in a bucket of chum
[43:17.990 --> 43:20.170]  is what we're looking at. And there's
[43:20.170 --> 43:21.410]  no Diet Coke, by the way.
[43:21.410 --> 43:23.150]  That was the thing that pissed me off.
[43:23.490 --> 43:25.670]  They only had Coke and Sprite. No Diet Coke.
[43:26.650 --> 43:27.170]  And so
[43:27.850 --> 43:29.170]  I was just trying to drink a Sprite.
[43:29.290 --> 43:31.590]  And I'm feeling really bad. And Emily's
[43:31.590 --> 43:33.290]  I can tell, feeling really bad.
[43:33.550 --> 43:35.390]  And we're now 45
[43:35.390 --> 43:37.230]  minutes into the trip back.
[43:37.670 --> 43:39.390]  And the boat keeps going slower.
[43:39.670 --> 43:40.350]  And I'd say about
[43:41.790 --> 43:42.590]  45 minutes
[43:43.290 --> 43:45.450]  I noticed that we're not really going. We just seem to
[43:45.450 --> 43:46.990]  be kind of floating.
[43:47.910 --> 43:49.130]  Well, I should go back.
[43:49.130 --> 43:50.870]  I should dial back to maybe about
[43:50.870 --> 43:53.050]  20 minutes before this moment. We're sitting
[43:53.050 --> 43:54.210]  there and I'm rocking.
[43:54.850 --> 43:57.110]  And then I realize I'm absolutely going to
[43:57.110 --> 43:59.170]  throw up. There was no way to hold it back.
[43:59.310 --> 44:00.610]  And so I run over to the side of the boat.
[44:00.690 --> 44:02.470]  And I throw up a good
[44:03.010 --> 44:05.170]  five or six times. Huge vomit.
[44:05.430 --> 44:06.610]  And is the boat moving?
[44:06.970 --> 44:08.630]  Oh, yeah. Slowly, but it is moving.
[44:09.230 --> 44:10.830]  And I'm like...
[44:10.830 --> 44:12.650]  You know, just fucking
[44:14.070 --> 44:14.870]  ocean nausea
[44:14.870 --> 44:17.050]  vomiting, right? It's not pretty. It's a horrible
[44:17.050 --> 44:18.270]  sound. Oh, Henry's here.
[44:19.050 --> 44:19.690]  Found his...
[44:19.690 --> 44:23.510]  Yeah, that's right. You fucked that toy up.
[44:24.470 --> 44:25.110]  This story's
[44:25.630 --> 44:27.410]  just the best. I hope it never ends.
[44:27.950 --> 44:29.310]  Well, we got a ways to go.
[44:30.370 --> 44:30.690]  So,
[44:31.510 --> 44:32.910]  I turn back to look at Emily.
[44:33.070 --> 44:34.830]  She's like, are you alright? And she sees me
[44:34.830 --> 44:36.690]  and she almost throws up in her mouth and turns away.
[44:36.750 --> 44:38.090]  I can't look at you. I can't look at you.
[44:38.490 --> 44:40.710]  And I'm like, oh my god, what? And I don't know.
[44:41.070 --> 44:42.230]  I just like am sitting there.
[44:42.650 --> 44:44.890]  And I sit there for a while and Emily's just like
[44:44.890 --> 44:46.650]  I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't look at you.
[44:46.690 --> 44:48.310]  I'm going to throw up. I couldn't figure out why.
[44:48.490 --> 44:50.030]  I thought it was because I was throwing up over the ocean.
[44:50.410 --> 44:53.050]  After a few minutes, like maybe about five minutes after I calmed down,
[44:53.470 --> 44:54.910]  I touched my
[44:54.910 --> 44:56.830]  face and I realized my face is
[44:56.830 --> 44:58.710]  covered in puke. And Emily said
[44:58.710 --> 45:00.790]  later it looked like I drank a cappuccino
[45:00.790 --> 45:02.730]  of vomit. And it was just like I had like
[45:02.730 --> 45:03.830]  a cappuccino mustache
[45:04.990 --> 45:06.410]  of puke around, you know?
[45:06.690 --> 45:08.410]  And so I'm like trying to wipe it off.
[45:08.630 --> 45:10.730]  Oh boy, he's...
[45:10.730 --> 45:10.930]  Henry!
[45:13.270 --> 45:13.970]  Give it a break.
[45:14.830 --> 45:16.110]  Give the octopus a break.
[45:17.510 --> 45:18.870]  Oh yeah, now settle in.
[45:19.210 --> 45:20.850]  Hunker down. That's good. Yeah, he's getting cozy.
[45:21.050 --> 45:22.930]  So he can really... Is that different to the owl
[45:22.930 --> 45:25.210]  that he usually has? Yeah, the owl owl is in the other room.
[45:25.370 --> 45:27.370]  This is Puss Puss, as we call it.
[45:28.070 --> 45:28.990]  A little blue octopus.
[45:30.450 --> 45:30.810]  So...
[45:32.430 --> 45:32.790]  So...
[45:33.230 --> 45:34.830]  At this point, I lay down
[45:34.830 --> 45:36.410]  and I'm like I gotta go to sleep.
[45:36.690 --> 45:38.870]  Because I'm exhausted. And I start to fall asleep
[45:38.870 --> 45:40.070]  just laying on the side of the boat.
[45:40.170 --> 45:42.750]  Just holding my tummy. And every time I wake up
[45:42.750 --> 45:44.150]  as I'm falling to the floor
[45:44.150 --> 45:46.690]  or my head is slamming back into the side of the ocean
[45:46.690 --> 45:47.830]  from the waves, right?
[45:48.270 --> 45:50.230]  So that's where I was for 20 minutes.
[45:50.350 --> 45:52.370]  Eventually I get up. And then I realize
[45:52.370 --> 45:54.150]  that we're going really slow at some point in this.
[45:54.630 --> 45:56.390]  We're probably about 45 minutes into the return.
[45:56.950 --> 45:58.550]  And I look back there and I realize
[45:58.550 --> 46:00.590]  neither engine is going. And I hear the guy
[46:00.590 --> 46:02.030]  trying to start it.
[46:02.650 --> 46:04.950]  And then for the next
[46:04.950 --> 46:06.870]  30 minutes, I can only describe...
[46:06.870 --> 46:08.770]  I can only say...
[46:08.770 --> 46:10.670]  I watched two men
[46:10.670 --> 46:12.450]  try to get an...
[46:12.450 --> 46:14.370]  It took me a while to piece together what was happening.
[46:14.470 --> 46:16.190]  There was a lot of yelling. There was a lot of screaming
[46:16.890 --> 46:18.250]  over the radio.
[46:18.690 --> 46:20.670]  I just keep hearing, Caliente!
[46:20.910 --> 46:22.530]  Caliente! Over the radio. Caliente!
[46:22.790 --> 46:24.710]  And then I realize, I guess
[46:24.710 --> 46:26.490]  the other engine, the one that was working,
[46:26.790 --> 46:28.050]  has overheated from
[46:29.310 --> 46:30.190]  excessive use.
[46:30.830 --> 46:32.410]  And so the guy is literally
[46:32.410 --> 46:34.910]  standing on the top of it, trying to push
[46:34.910 --> 46:36.830]  it into the ocean to
[46:36.830 --> 46:38.750]  submerge it to cool it down.
[46:40.330 --> 46:41.150]  So now
[46:41.150 --> 46:42.130]  we're in a situation
[46:42.810 --> 46:44.150]  where I think we're gonna die.
[46:45.050 --> 46:46.270]  We're probably gonna die.
[46:46.450 --> 46:48.590]  I haven't seen land in three hours.
[46:49.130 --> 46:50.630]  I've been beaten to hell,
[46:50.830 --> 46:51.470]  banged around
[46:52.870 --> 46:54.450]  for hours and hours.
[46:54.630 --> 46:56.770]  I've got no food in me. The only food
[46:56.770 --> 46:58.710]  available is slathered in mayonnaise and
[46:58.710 --> 47:00.470]  chum. And I got a...
[47:00.470 --> 47:02.570]  I got a half a Sprite to my name.
[47:03.970 --> 47:04.690]  And, uh...
[47:04.690 --> 47:06.430]  And this guy's trying to
[47:07.290 --> 47:08.730]  submerge the boat to save
[47:08.730 --> 47:09.970]  the engine, you know, essentially.
[47:10.470 --> 47:12.590]  And so they eventually work out a system where
[47:12.590 --> 47:14.630]  they drive for a few minutes really
[47:14.630 --> 47:16.530]  slowly. If we were in third gear before, we're in
[47:16.530 --> 47:18.590]  first gear now. Which, by the way, first
[47:18.590 --> 47:20.650]  gear in open ocean, you don't
[47:20.650 --> 47:22.590]  go forward. It's like you kind of go
[47:22.590 --> 47:24.530]  in whatever direction the ocean tells you to go with
[47:24.530 --> 47:26.770]  a little bit of zeal. You know, just a little gusto
[47:26.770 --> 47:28.950]  in that direction. So we're just getting...
[47:28.950 --> 47:30.710]  we're going left, we're going right, we're
[47:30.710 --> 47:32.430]  going back, occasionally forward.
[47:32.790 --> 47:34.750]  Very rarely are we going... we're certainly not going in a
[47:34.750 --> 47:36.210]  straight line, and we're not going anywhere.
[47:37.070 --> 47:38.570]  Right? And every once in a while
[47:38.570 --> 47:41.210]  the engine will conk out, and then we'll...
[47:41.210 --> 47:42.090]  it'll be too caliente.
[47:42.390 --> 47:44.670]  And they'll be, like, trying to cool down, and then after a few
[47:44.670 --> 47:46.170]  minutes they'll, like...
[47:47.670 --> 47:48.850]  It'll get started again.
[47:49.150 --> 47:50.630]  And then we'll go for a few more minutes, and then
[47:50.630 --> 47:52.070]  it'll stop. And we're like,
[47:52.090 --> 47:54.850]  what is going on? How long
[47:54.850 --> 47:56.810]  till we get back? And the guy goes, 30 minutes.
[47:56.890 --> 47:58.930]  And I'm like, there's no fucking way
[47:58.930 --> 48:00.950]  we're going to be back in 30 minutes. We're not.
[48:01.510 --> 48:03.010]  We're hours away from land
[48:03.010 --> 48:04.890]  at this point. I don't even know that we're headed in the right
[48:04.890 --> 48:05.590]  fucking direction.
[48:06.790 --> 48:09.070]  It's brutal. And then, sure enough,
[48:09.130 --> 48:11.070]  about 30 minutes later, two boats show
[48:11.070 --> 48:13.110]  up on the horizon. And, I mean,
[48:13.130 --> 48:15.030]  I'm thinking about writing, like, writing my
[48:15.030 --> 48:17.070]  goodbyes at this point. Like, I don't know
[48:17.070 --> 48:18.770]  what else to do. We're just getting
[48:18.770 --> 48:20.870]  slammed left and right. I'm beyond
[48:20.870 --> 48:22.950]  nauseous. Joey seems fine,
[48:22.990 --> 48:24.930]  like he's having a great day. Emily looks
[48:24.930 --> 48:26.990]  like she wants to die. He's just tucking
[48:26.990 --> 48:29.050]  into the chum. He's fine. He's fine.
[48:29.090 --> 48:30.610]  He's happy. He doesn't get seasick. He's
[48:30.610 --> 48:32.810]  loving life, right? Tamera's doing...
[48:32.810 --> 48:35.090]  I found out later, it was to keep herself from vomiting.
[48:35.230 --> 48:37.150]  She was doing New York Times crossword
[48:37.150 --> 48:38.990]  puzzles on her phone, which
[48:38.990 --> 48:41.070]  I don't know how that kept
[48:41.070 --> 48:42.910]  her from vomiting, because anytime I
[48:43.630 --> 48:44.970]  focused on anything, it made me want
[48:44.970 --> 48:47.110]  to vomit. But anyway, two boats
[48:47.110 --> 48:49.170]  show up on the horizon, and we're like,
[48:49.610 --> 48:51.110]  what's this? And they're like,
[48:51.470 --> 48:52.930]  one of the boats... and the guys
[48:52.930 --> 48:54.790]  aren't talking to us. They're in a bad,
[48:54.790 --> 48:56.690]  bad mood. And we're in a bad mood.
[48:57.190 --> 48:58.770]  And I can tell this has been very
[48:58.770 --> 49:00.710]  stressful on them. Probably not as stressful as
[49:00.710 --> 49:02.730]  it's been on us, but maybe ignorance is bliss. I don't
[49:02.730 --> 49:04.810]  know how close to dead we are, right? This other
[49:04.810 --> 49:06.850]  boat full of... it's another whale
[49:06.850 --> 49:08.650]  watching... whale shark watching tour. Full
[49:09.130 --> 49:10.830]  boat, right? It gets a little
[49:10.830 --> 49:12.650]  close to us, and the guy
[49:12.650 --> 49:13.910]  turns to us and he goes, uh,
[49:14.350 --> 49:16.710]  they're gonna take you back. And we're like, oh, so
[49:16.710 --> 49:18.530]  we're gonna get on that boat? And he goes, yeah.
[49:18.790 --> 49:20.210]  And I go, how?
[49:20.770 --> 49:22.790]  And he goes, go! Go now! Go now!
[49:22.790 --> 49:24.810]  And we go, what? What? And he goes, go
[49:24.810 --> 49:26.750]  now! Get in the ocean! Go now! And we're
[49:26.750 --> 49:28.850]  like, what? Our stuff! And he goes, don't worry
[49:28.850 --> 49:30.710]  about it! Go now! I've got your stuff!
[49:30.770 --> 49:32.770]  And we're like, what? And we all dive into the
[49:32.770 --> 49:34.570]  ocean, and then we have to swim
[49:34.570 --> 49:36.930]  through these giant waves and crazy
[49:36.930 --> 49:38.770]  with no flippers on or
[49:38.770 --> 49:40.510]  anything. Just like, fuck, I got my
[49:40.510 --> 49:42.790]  hat on, my clothes, I'm like, I just
[49:42.790 --> 49:44.830]  fuckin' swim, barely to
[49:44.830 --> 49:46.810]  get to beat, slam against this other boat,
[49:46.890 --> 49:48.870]  which is way too far away. I get there,
[49:49.090 --> 49:50.710]  pull ourselves up, get on the boat, right?
[49:50.710 --> 49:52.530]  No idea what just happened, look back!
[49:52.790 --> 49:54.710]  And I'm like, all our stuff's on that boat! And then I
[49:54.710 --> 49:56.770]  see, I see all of our shit just flying
[49:56.770 --> 49:58.790]  through the air, from one boat to
[49:58.790 --> 50:00.590]  another. They're just chucking it at us, right?
[50:00.850 --> 50:02.690]  Just like, there goes my bag! There goes
[50:02.690 --> 50:04.490]  Emily's bag! There goes somebody's hat!
[50:04.690 --> 50:06.710]  And I realize, oh my god, my phone and
[50:06.710 --> 50:08.750]  my wallet are in my shoes! There go my
[50:08.750 --> 50:10.810]  shoes! Threw my shoes 30
[50:10.810 --> 50:12.810]  feet in the air over open ocean
[50:12.810 --> 50:14.610]  with my phone and my fuckin' wallet
[50:14.610 --> 50:16.710]  in it! I fuckin' run up, they're there, we
[50:16.710 --> 50:18.470]  didn't lose anything, but I was like,
[50:18.470 --> 50:20.290]  I was like, oh, I couldn't believe it, dude.
[50:20.550 --> 50:22.190]  It was the most horrific thing I've ever seen.
[50:22.410 --> 50:23.690]  It's like, just all of our shit, like,
[50:23.830 --> 50:26.510]  exploding on the ground on the boat, right?
[50:29.950 --> 50:31.210]  Then, those guys,
[50:31.990 --> 50:33.650]  the boat we're on, they're like,
[50:33.650 --> 50:36.010]  sit down! We sit down for a second, then we
[50:36.010 --> 50:38.030]  just take off! And those guys, as far
[50:38.030 --> 50:39.510]  as I know, they're still there.
[50:40.790 --> 50:42.010]  We just left them,
[50:42.230 --> 50:43.630]  we just left them
[50:43.630 --> 50:45.790]  bobbing in the ocean. And we
[50:46.390 --> 50:47.970]  assaulted some other crews,
[50:47.970 --> 50:49.670]  right? So then we're on this other crews,
[50:49.730 --> 50:51.950]  it becomes apparent very quickly,
[50:52.230 --> 50:54.010]  nobody on this boat speaks English, either.
[50:54.190 --> 50:55.970]  The people on the crews are from somewhere
[50:55.970 --> 50:57.910]  in Eastern Europe, and then the boat captain
[50:57.910 --> 50:59.710]  and stuff there, and so, they're like,
[51:00.050 --> 51:01.830]  all the seats in the back, they communicate to us,
[51:01.890 --> 51:03.910]  all the seats in the back are full, you're gonna have to sit up
[51:03.910 --> 51:05.770]  front. We're like, yeah, okay, why?
[51:05.950 --> 51:07.650]  Who cares? Whatever, we're just happy to sit.
[51:07.910 --> 51:09.970]  So we sit up front, and then they crank
[51:09.970 --> 51:11.790]  this thing into fifth gear, suddenly
[51:11.790 --> 51:13.990]  we're going, nausea goes away
[51:14.790 --> 51:16.050]  immediately, like a light
[51:16.050 --> 51:17.970]  switch, we start cutting through the waves,
[51:18.290 --> 51:19.930]  but, the reason nobody
[51:19.930 --> 51:21.770]  wanted to sit up front is because every
[51:21.770 --> 51:23.930]  wave, we get drenched.
[51:24.330 --> 51:25.910]  I'm talking torrential,
[51:26.330 --> 51:27.950]  like, 17 buckets
[51:27.950 --> 51:30.050]  of, 17 five gallon buckets of water
[51:30.050 --> 51:31.470]  thrown in your face all at once.
[51:32.050 --> 51:33.270]  Which is quite refreshing,
[51:33.750 --> 51:35.870]  after everything else, and then we just
[51:35.870 --> 51:37.990]  rocket back, just drenched
[51:37.990 --> 51:39.990]  from head to toe, but the
[51:39.990 --> 51:41.990]  nausea's gone, I couldn't be happier,
[51:42.070 --> 51:43.810]  I'm just, I'm smiling
[51:43.810 --> 51:44.910]  from ear to ear,
[51:45.810 --> 51:47.550]  so much that I'm just swallowing
[51:47.550 --> 51:49.710]  gallons of salt water, because I don't even care,
[51:49.950 --> 51:51.670]  because it's just slamming me in the face like a
[51:52.190 --> 51:53.850]  movie. I can imagine you
[51:53.850 --> 51:55.830]  seeing, like, Hope, you see all the things that
[51:55.830 --> 51:57.890]  are good in life, and you picture a nice set of
[51:57.890 --> 51:58.990]  man hands waiting for you.
[51:59.870 --> 52:01.590]  I'm like, I'm gonna get the biggest fucking massage!
[52:02.410 --> 52:03.910]  And, uh, so then we
[52:03.910 --> 52:05.750]  start to pull back up to Isla Mujeres,
[52:06.010 --> 52:07.810]  and we put two and two together, on
[52:07.810 --> 52:10.010]  their tour, it goes to a
[52:10.010 --> 52:11.910]  sandbar by the beach. The previous
[52:11.910 --> 52:13.890]  tour we had done this as well, where you go to this
[52:13.890 --> 52:16.010]  sandbar off the coast where the water's really brewing pretty,
[52:16.230 --> 52:17.910]  and then people go swimming, and then so
[52:17.910 --> 52:19.830]  we get there and we dot, like they throw down the anchor,
[52:19.930 --> 52:21.970]  and they're like, okay, they communicate, we're gonna be
[52:21.970 --> 52:24.070]  here for about fifteen minutes, go swimming,
[52:24.430 --> 52:25.910]  relax, then we'll cook up some
[52:25.910 --> 52:27.870]  fresh ceviche for you, and then we'll take you guys
[52:27.870 --> 52:30.010]  back to Cancun. And we're like, A,
[52:30.570 --> 52:31.970]  uh, I, swimming is the last
[52:31.970 --> 52:34.010]  thing on earth I wanna fucking do right now, B,
[52:34.370 --> 52:35.910]  I won't be eating again any
[52:35.910 --> 52:37.630]  time soon, and C, did you say Cancun?
[52:38.110 --> 52:39.550]  And they're like, yeah, yeah, this
[52:39.550 --> 52:40.790]  this charter goes to Cancun.
[52:41.330 --> 52:43.730]  And I'm like, no, no, no, we're here on this island,
[52:43.830 --> 52:45.090]  take us to a dock on this island.
[52:45.250 --> 52:47.250]  And he's like, no, we don't
[52:47.250 --> 52:49.550]  go to a dock on this island, we dock in Cancun.
[52:49.730 --> 52:51.550]  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, but we're already here,
[52:51.870 --> 52:53.870]  and Cancun is, uh, thirty-five
[52:53.870 --> 52:55.570]  it's thirty-five miles that way,
[52:55.750 --> 52:57.590]  and then when we get to Cancun, we have no
[52:57.590 --> 52:59.570]  way to get back, so then we'll have to figure out how
[52:59.570 --> 53:01.570]  to get from your dock to the ferry,
[53:01.850 --> 53:03.610]  and then we'll have to, the ferry only runs every
[53:03.610 --> 53:05.270]  thirty minutes, so we'll have to buy tickets,
[53:05.430 --> 53:07.530]  and then we'll have to take a ferry all the way back to where
[53:07.530 --> 53:09.730]  we are right now, so if you could just take us to a dock,
[53:09.850 --> 53:11.730]  and the guy's like, nah, nah, you can swim,
[53:11.850 --> 53:12.790]  and then we'll take you back to Cancun.
[53:13.370 --> 53:15.510]  So I'm like, fuck this, and fuck you.
[53:15.810 --> 53:17.610]  I look at the guys, and I'm like, we're swimming
[53:17.610 --> 53:19.670]  in. And they're like, what? And I grab,
[53:19.790 --> 53:21.230]  I look, it looks like I can stand,
[53:21.630 --> 53:23.590]  I grab all of our stuff, I give
[53:23.590 --> 53:25.470]  Joey the rest of it, because the girls aren't tall enough,
[53:25.550 --> 53:27.470]  they jump in the water, I jump, I
[53:27.470 --> 53:29.410]  jump in the water with all the stuff on my head,
[53:29.730 --> 53:31.790]  like all of our bags and shoes and everything on our head.
[53:31.890 --> 53:33.190]  Wait, how far out are you?
[53:33.810 --> 53:35.370]  Uh, I mean like
[53:36.970 --> 53:37.610]  300 feet?
[53:38.410 --> 53:38.510]  Maybe?
[53:39.130 --> 53:40.850]  It's a sandbar, it's a long walk, but
[53:41.290 --> 53:43.410]  I hit the water, and I feel
[53:43.410 --> 53:45.150]  a sting on my finger as I hit the water.
[53:45.290 --> 53:46.950]  I'm getting off the stairs,
[53:47.250 --> 53:49.550]  off the boat, and I'm like, ow, fuck, but I can't see anything
[53:49.550 --> 53:51.390]  because my hands are
[53:51.390 --> 53:53.250]  above my head, like I'm going
[53:53.250 --> 53:55.570]  down to the watering hole to fill up the watering can,
[53:55.630 --> 53:57.450]  and then I'm walking it back up to the village, right?
[53:57.510 --> 53:58.970]  On top of my head, with all of our shit.
[53:59.350 --> 54:01.010]  And the water's just about to my chin,
[54:01.170 --> 54:03.370]  and Joey's a little bit taller than me, so about the same, the girls have to
[54:03.370 --> 54:05.550]  swim, and we very, very
[54:05.550 --> 54:07.070]  slowly walk
[54:07.070 --> 54:09.230]  onto the beach, holding everything
[54:09.230 --> 54:11.650]  amidst all of these, like, sunbathers
[54:11.650 --> 54:12.970]  and people playing beach volleyball,
[54:13.570 --> 54:15.110]  and jet skis, and it's like a fucking...
[54:15.110 --> 54:16.070]  Where do they think you came from?
[54:16.210 --> 54:19.110]  Yeah, and we're like refugees, you know,
[54:19.230 --> 54:20.890]  just coming in from the open ocean,
[54:21.230 --> 54:22.910]  like a long walk in,
[54:23.130 --> 54:25.410]  and we get to the beach, and I fucking put that stuff
[54:25.410 --> 54:27.310]  on the ground for a second, and I'm like, oh my god.
[54:27.510 --> 54:29.530]  And I look at my hand, and my hand is covered
[54:29.530 --> 54:31.210]  in blood. And I'm like,
[54:31.210 --> 54:33.230]  what the fuck? My left
[54:33.230 --> 54:35.170]  finger, I see on my left finger,
[54:35.290 --> 54:36.890]  where my, on my pinky finger,
[54:37.290 --> 54:39.190]  the area, like, to the left of
[54:39.190 --> 54:41.350]  the nail, I guess it got caught
[54:41.350 --> 54:43.130]  on the stairs, and it's just ripped
[54:43.130 --> 54:45.350]  a gash open, where like, a giant
[54:45.350 --> 54:47.270]  chuck of my flesh is pulled open,
[54:47.410 --> 54:49.210]  and it's just shooting blood out. And I'm like,
[54:49.250 --> 54:51.210]  ah, fuck. So, and I'm like, I'm not getting
[54:51.210 --> 54:52.990]  stitches or anything, right? And so I just like,
[54:53.050 --> 54:55.210]  I eventually get a band-aid and put it on,
[54:55.350 --> 54:57.210]  and, uh, and then I have
[54:57.210 --> 54:58.290]  to deal with that for the rest of the trip.
[54:58.910 --> 55:00.150]  But then we, we just fucking
[55:00.150 --> 55:02.270]  take a cab, from that point, we just walk up
[55:02.270 --> 55:04.170]  to a cab, take a cab back to the dock,
[55:04.490 --> 55:06.250]  get in our golf cart, and go home.
[55:07.230 --> 55:08.370]  Uh, now, the thing
[55:08.370 --> 55:10.350]  that I didn't mention, uh, that I couldn't tell
[55:10.350 --> 55:12.410]  you is, I woke up that night, the morning
[55:12.410 --> 55:14.310]  of that trip, at three in the morning
[55:14.310 --> 55:16.170]  with a nightmare. And Emily happened to wake up too,
[55:16.230 --> 55:18.250]  and she goes, what's wrong? And I go, I have a nightmare. I had
[55:18.250 --> 55:20.130]  a nightmare, it was really serious. And she goes, what was your nightmare?
[55:20.170 --> 55:22.250]  And I go, I dreamed we were out on the boat, and
[55:22.250 --> 55:23.890]  we got stuck, like, open water,
[55:24.150 --> 55:26.290]  and there was nobody to rescue us, and we were just
[55:26.290 --> 55:28.010]  floating there forever, and then eventually we died.
[55:28.130 --> 55:30.030]  And she's like, well that's not gonna happen, go back to bed.
[55:32.710 --> 55:34.270]  So, there was this, like, underlying
[55:34.270 --> 55:36.450]  tension, did you ever, like, give each other little looks?
[55:36.990 --> 55:38.470]  Yeah, the whole trip, the whole
[55:38.470 --> 55:39.090]  time, yeah.
[55:39.930 --> 55:41.470]  But nobody wanted to mention it?
[55:42.610 --> 55:44.110]  No. So, I think
[55:44.110 --> 55:46.370]  I did okay there, I hope I covered
[55:46.370 --> 55:48.310]  that properly. Oh, and I don't know if it's
[55:49.230 --> 55:50.310]  been apparent at any point,
[55:50.410 --> 55:52.370]  but at no point
[55:52.370 --> 55:54.290]  in this six, it was over
[55:54.290 --> 55:55.770]  six hours, seven hours,
[55:56.330 --> 55:57.630]  did I see a whale shark?
[55:58.430 --> 56:00.370]  I would love to see, like,
[56:00.450 --> 56:02.230]  the GPS path on a
[56:02.230 --> 56:04.270]  map of where the hell you went.
[56:05.430 --> 56:06.170]  I'd love to know, like,
[56:06.210 --> 56:08.350]  at what point was the GPS tracking
[56:08.350 --> 56:10.050]  a phone in a shoe, flying
[56:10.050 --> 56:12.410]  30 feet between two... Oh my god,
[56:12.510 --> 56:13.730]  dude, there was
[56:15.230 --> 56:16.110]  about an
[56:16.110 --> 56:18.190]  hour where I thought we were gonna
[56:18.190 --> 56:20.310]  die, and about 30 minutes in the middle
[56:20.310 --> 56:21.410]  of that where I wanted it.
[56:21.410 --> 56:23.130]  I was just so
[56:23.130 --> 56:25.510]  nauseous and unhappy, and
[56:25.510 --> 56:27.330]  just beat to hell from the
[56:27.330 --> 56:29.310]  sun, and just, and
[56:29.310 --> 56:31.550]  starving, but nauseous,
[56:31.710 --> 56:32.470]  and just bruised.
[56:32.510 --> 56:33.690]  You paid to do that?
[56:35.170 --> 56:37.030]  Yeah, we didn't get a refund.
[56:38.790 --> 56:39.670]  They wouldn't
[56:39.670 --> 56:40.550]  give us a refund.
[56:45.530 --> 56:47.210]  What a disaster.
[56:47.810 --> 56:49.470]  How many days in was that
[56:49.470 --> 56:51.050]  to your trip? That was day
[56:51.050 --> 56:53.090]  3 of 7, I think, or 6.
[56:53.450 --> 56:54.170]  Nice in the middle.
[56:55.070 --> 56:57.230]  What a bonding experience, though.
[56:57.590 --> 56:59.490]  Yeah, we all, I mean,
[56:59.570 --> 57:01.250]  we bonded
[57:01.250 --> 57:03.450]  over tragedy. Dude, I'm telling you,
[57:03.910 --> 57:05.670]  having a guy scream
[57:05.670 --> 57:07.490]  go, go now, when you
[57:07.490 --> 57:09.630]  are not ready to get in an open ocean
[57:09.630 --> 57:11.310]  and swim 30 feet
[57:11.310 --> 57:13.450]  to another boat, and not sure what's
[57:13.450 --> 57:15.530]  supposed to happen when you get there, is not
[57:15.530 --> 57:17.410]  a fun experience. I just
[57:17.410 --> 57:19.250]  don't understand how whenever
[57:19.250 --> 57:21.130]  there are instructions for you to, like,
[57:21.330 --> 57:23.370]  get in the sea, or get in the boat, or switch
[57:23.370 --> 57:25.290]  boats, why was it always so
[57:25.290 --> 57:26.750]  frantic? We don't know.
[57:27.190 --> 57:29.210]  I don't know. Don't understand.
[57:29.810 --> 57:30.390]  I don't know.
[57:30.590 --> 57:33.470]  I don't know. I wish I could tell you.
[57:33.730 --> 57:35.530]  I'll tell you this, we've all agreed,
[57:35.850 --> 57:37.250]  nobody was up for it by the end of this trip
[57:37.250 --> 57:39.270]  because we were exhausted, but we're all getting go, go now
[57:39.270 --> 57:41.290]  tattoos. Because that's all we
[57:41.290 --> 57:43.170]  said to each other for the rest of the trip. Go, go now!
[57:43.270 --> 57:45.490]  Anytime, anything. You want to go get dinner? Go, go now!
[57:46.070 --> 57:46.770]  Because it
[57:47.930 --> 57:49.490]  was... I will hear that on
[57:49.490 --> 57:51.430]  my deck bed. Go, go now. I'll never
[57:51.430 --> 57:53.470]  forget that man's... those two
[57:53.470 --> 57:55.290]  men screaming that. Those two times.
[57:56.410 --> 57:56.830]  Go, go now.
[57:56.830 --> 57:59.170]  The way that they were screaming that, I was half expecting
[57:59.710 --> 58:01.390]  like an out of control
[58:01.390 --> 58:03.390]  boat with no brakes just coming
[58:03.390 --> 58:05.570]  hurtling towards you, and he was like, jump
[58:05.570 --> 58:07.330]  out of the way of it. I'm starting to wonder
[58:07.330 --> 58:09.470]  it's like, was the boat gonna catch fire
[58:09.470 --> 58:10.890]  any second? Like, were we...
[58:11.400 --> 58:13.210]  as we were boat, as we were like
[58:13.210 --> 58:15.110]  fucking speeding away, I kept waiting
[58:15.110 --> 58:17.090]  to see if there was like a little mushroom cloud
[58:17.090 --> 58:17.950]  behind me, you know?
[58:18.810 --> 58:21.230]  I don't know if they were just like... the guys were just stressed
[58:21.230 --> 58:23.150]  the fuck out because they were also 40 or
[58:23.150 --> 58:24.770]  50 miles out into open ocean
[58:24.770 --> 58:27.250]  with a boat that didn't work, and they didn't know how to get back
[58:27.250 --> 58:29.250]  or what, but... and they couldn't fix it, but
[58:29.250 --> 58:31.210]  God fucking damn it, dude.
[58:31.650 --> 58:33.250]  That was not the place
[58:33.250 --> 58:35.310]  to be. And it was not a fun experience.
[58:35.590 --> 58:37.290]  And I... Not the place
[58:37.290 --> 58:38.550]  to be for the whale sharks, apparently.
[58:39.970 --> 58:40.690]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:40.690 --> 58:42.770]  And I'm kind of glad I didn't see
[58:42.770 --> 58:44.630]  them, because what was... it felt gross
[58:44.630 --> 58:46.770]  when we were out there. There's like a ton of people in the water,
[58:46.870 --> 58:48.590]  there's a million boats, and people are
[58:48.590 --> 58:50.730]  throwing up left and right, and I was like, man, if I was
[58:50.730 --> 58:52.810]  a whale shark, I wouldn't come within a thousand miles of this
[58:52.810 --> 58:54.650]  shit, you know? So how long were you in the water
[58:54.650 --> 58:56.590]  total? I was in the water for about
[58:56.590 --> 58:58.510]  a minute, going from
[58:59.130 --> 59:00.710]  one end of the boat to the other
[59:00.710 --> 59:02.670]  while the guys screamed, no sharks here,
[59:02.770 --> 59:04.830]  no sharks here. And then
[59:05.310 --> 59:06.870]  I was in the water for
[59:07.230 --> 59:07.550]  the...
[59:08.630 --> 59:09.350]  For the
[59:10.090 --> 59:11.370]  daring mid-ocean
[59:11.370 --> 59:12.410]  rescue, maybe
[59:13.450 --> 59:14.330]  90 seconds.
[59:14.610 --> 59:17.710]  So the rescue was longer than the whale shark
[59:17.710 --> 59:19.670]  experience? Yes, the rescue
[59:19.670 --> 59:21.110]  was longer than the whale shark experience.
[59:21.350 --> 59:23.650]  And there wasn't a whale shark experience for Joey and Tamara,
[59:23.650 --> 59:25.190]  they never got in the water, so their
[59:25.190 --> 59:27.310]  experience was only the rescue experience.
[59:28.230 --> 59:29.570]  And then the 45
[59:29.570 --> 59:31.690]  minutes of just getting... of having
[59:31.690 --> 59:33.430]  somebody spray a garden hose in your face
[59:33.430 --> 59:34.030]  on the way home.
[59:37.730 --> 59:39.130]  That sounds so miserable.
[59:39.390 --> 59:41.730]  It's terrible. That's horrendous.
[59:41.970 --> 59:43.290]  Great Geoff vacation.
[59:43.850 --> 59:44.290]  Yeah.
[59:45.710 --> 59:47.050]  They're rarely boring.
[59:47.770 --> 59:49.690]  And I realize we're at right about an hour.
[59:50.430 --> 59:51.370]  That was only the first
[59:51.370 --> 59:53.470]  two of my 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 things.
[59:54.070 --> 59:55.070]  So let me hit you up with
[59:55.070 --> 59:56.930]  Backpack real fast. This is a quick one.
[59:57.570 --> 59:59.170]  We're coming home from Mexico,
[59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.470]  trip home, all kinds of fucked up,
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.390]  global entry isn't working right, my passport
[01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.350]  isn't working right. I get it, it's like
[01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:07.130]  COVID issues, right?
[01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.050]  So it was kind of a stressful trip home.
[01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:11.090]  You know what it's like, coming in, going through
[01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:13.090]  immigration, all that stuff. We finally get there, we land in
[01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.110]  Dallas. We land in... Gavin,
[01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.130]  we land in D24
[01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:18.370]  and I gotta go to
[01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:20.610]  B7 or something, right?
[01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.250]  Skyrail. So it's like five stops
[01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.250]  on the Skyrail. So we get up,
[01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:26.990]  Emily and I are both exhausted,
[01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.190]  we just missed the Skyrail. She's like, I'm gonna go sit
[01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.070]  on that bench and wait for the next one. So she
[01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.290]  goes over and sits on the bench. I'm like, fuck it, I'll go sit next to her.
[01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.190]  I go sit next to her too. Immediately
[01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.410]  the thing shows up, so we walk over, get
[01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.210]  on it. Go one stop,
[01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:41.450]  two stops, three stops,
[01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:43.290]  fourth stop, fifth stop,
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:45.330]  we get off. I go to get up, I go
[01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.270]  to grab my bag. I don't have a bag.
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:49.430]  And where the fuck is
[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.450]  my backpack? Oh my god.
[01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:53.490]  I think I... did I leave it on the park bench?
[01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.310]  It's the only thing that makes sense. So I look at Emily,
[01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.270]  we have 17 minutes for our flight boards. I'm like,
[01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.470]  I gotta go back! I just run out
[01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:01.370]  of the SkyTram, across the hallway, to
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:02.910]  the other one, hop on the other one, go
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.350]  the five slowest, scariest
[01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.370]  stops back, bolt out of that
[01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.290]  thing. My backpack's just sitting there waiting
[01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.230]  for me. Completely and totally
[01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.890]  ignored by everybody else on the airport.
[01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.430]  I cannot believe it. I got it back.
[01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:17.310]  It had my driver's license
[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:19.390]  in it, it had my wallet, it had all of my money,
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:21.210]  it had my laptop, it had my passport,
[01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.930]  it had my phone,
[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:25.250]  it had everything in it. So where was this?
[01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:27.190]  Right by the... was it SkyLink?
[01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.130]  Right by there or was it downstairs? No,
[01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:31.090]  upstairs in the SkyLink. I think it's the only thing
[01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:33.010]  that saved me is no security
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.010]  or anybody's ever fucking around in the SkyLink, right? Because
[01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.090]  nobody's ever in there for that long. You just stand there
[01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:38.810]  for 30 seconds. So there's
[01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:41.150]  never a chance for people to mill around and notice
[01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.110]  it. So I think that was the only thing
[01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:44.710]  that saved it. But, uh,
[01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.190]  yeah, it took me maybe 10-12 minutes to get back
[01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:49.170]  and it was there. And that's the end
[01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.050]  of my vacation. I'm blown away that
[01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.010]  that was still there. A loose
[01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.150]  backpack in an airport doesn't last long.
[01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.550]  No, it does not.
[01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.950]  But the gods were smiling on me
[01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:00.670]  that day.
[01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.690]  The joy of your vacation
[01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.650]  wasn't the events that happened, it's the
[01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:06.690]  things that didn't and the tragedy of
[01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.590]  the other experiences. That's the only
[01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:10.590]  joy. Outside of Manhance, that sounds like
[01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:12.710]  it was a great time. But beyond that,
[01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:14.450]  you're just avoiding tragedy
[01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:16.310]  is the highlight of your vacation.
[01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.550]  Oh, I never want to go anywhere with you.
[01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:20.250]  No, I... yeah,
[01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.530]  I don't blame you. I don't blame you.
[01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.650]  How the fuck did that happen, dude?
[01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:26.750]  How did I get an hour
[01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.870]  out of 50 miles in the
[01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.930]  ocean on a tiny little, like,
[01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:32.210]  Gilligan's Island.
[01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.830]  The skipper's boat in Gilligan's Island is massive
[01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:36.810]  compared to this dinky little thing we were on.
[01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:38.570]  And we were out there for fucking
[01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:40.950]  floating around for like seven hours
[01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.450]  when it was all said and done.
[01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.790]  It's a terrifying experience. I've been out on a
[01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.630]  pretty small boat, you know, far enough away that
[01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.630]  you can't see any land. Where, like,
[01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.210]  your phone's not working, there's no signal.
[01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.430]  It is a bit scary.
[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:53.750]  Yeah. Because you realize
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.530]  not a lot of stuff has to go wrong, and you're
[01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:58.350]  in serious, like, life-threatening
[01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:00.370]  trouble. Yeah, one thing
[01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:01.590]  has to go wrong. A hole.
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:03.910]  That's it.
[01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:08.390]  How long would you
[01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.390]  have had to have spent out there for you to eat the
[01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:11.550]  ham and mayo sandwich?
[01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:14.490]  Dude, I don't think I could have ever
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.810]  eaten again. I was...
[01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:18.410]  I have never experienced
[01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.030]  nausea like that. And I'm not a...
[01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.930]  I realize I just got nauseous on
[01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:23.990]  roller coasters, like, three weeks ago in Florida, or a month
[01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.770]  ago in Florida, but that had way more to do with, like,
[01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.930]  particular stresses in my life and the trip
[01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:29.090]  than the roller coaster, I think.
[01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.950]  But I have...
[01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.770]  I wouldn't say I have, like, an iron
[01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:36.010]  stomach by any means, but I don't
[01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:37.890]  get nauseous. I don't get seasick.
[01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.530]  And I have never
[01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:41.250]  in my life experienced
[01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.170]  discomfort like that.
[01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.430]  I would do just about anything
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.390]  to never feel that way again.
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.810]  Amazing.
[01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:50.670]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.810]  So, real relaxing vacation,
[01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:55.170]  came back totally recharged and ready
[01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.770]  to re-tackle life.
[01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:59.310]  I would have said, based on
[01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.190]  our last recordings, that you needed the vacation.
[01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:03.550]  I don't think you needed that vacation.
[01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:05.450]  I also don't think
[01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:06.850]  I needed that vacation.
[01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:09.230]  Or at least not that portion
[01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:10.250]  of it. And, dude,
[01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:13.150]  we're not gonna get into it now, because we're about to end this fucker,
[01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.130]  but we'll start up the... I'm gonna get a drink, and then we'll
[01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.310]  start it up, and then I'll tell you all the other shit I have
[01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:17.930]  happened today.
[01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:19.910]  Just today.
[01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:23.310]  Alright, let's wrap it up. Let's get straight to the next one.
[01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:25.130]  Alright, this has been a f*** face
[01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:27.150]  production. Thanks for f***ing your
[01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.630]  face for the last hour.
[01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:30.750]  F*** you next week.
[01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:33.110]  In this recording,
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.850]  Andrew and I were the
[01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:37.050]  first engine that broke down, and Geoff
[01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:38.150]  was the one that had to do all the work.
[01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:39.730]  Oh my God, dude.
[01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:42.670]  Why didn't they turn around?
[01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:44.910]  We knew there was
[01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:46.810]  a problem ten minutes into this
[01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.590]  seven hour hell journey.
[01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.130]  Why didn't they turn around?
[01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:52.850]  I just keep thinking about
[01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:54.710]  what was happening in my life while you were
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:57.190]  experiencing that. Like, was I just preheating a pizza?
[01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:58.650]  Like, what mundane,
[01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:00.370]  uneventful thing?
[01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:02.690]  And then just cut to a guy yelling at you,
[01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:04.170]  Go now! Go, go, go!
[01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.330]  Go! Go now!
[01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:07.590]  Oh my God, dude.
[01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:10.670]  Oh, by the way,
[01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:11.990]  I feel like we should mention
[01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.710]  we do
[01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:16.450]  have a YouTube channel now,
[01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.490]  and all these are on YouTube,
[01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:20.690]  if you ever want to listen on YouTube, as everybody
[01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.750]  loves to do, to audio podcasts. But we also put
[01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.670]  the Break Show up there, so if you ever wanted to watch the Break Show and you
[01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.670]  couldn't figure out how to navigate the Rooster Teeth site,
[01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.670]  you can do it on YouTube. Are we putting the old episodes up?
[01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:30.590]  I don't know. I don't know. I guess
[01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:31.990]  at some point we should?
[01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.110]  I think we should. Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.670]  They're doing pretty well, but I've had a lot of people
[01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:38.330]  ask me if it's the official channel,
[01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:40.190]  or if it's like somebody ripping us off, and no,
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:42.650]  nobody wants to rip us off. It is us. We're ripping ourselves off.
[01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.750]  All right.
[01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:46.770]  See you next time.
[01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.350]  All right. Love you guys. See you next week.
[01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:48.750]  Bye.
