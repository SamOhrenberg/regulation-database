[00:00.000 --> 00:03.740]  Black bean and poblano burritos. Yum.
[00:04.120 --> 00:07.820]  That's just one of the delicious new recipes. How about pasta primavera? That's another one.
[00:08.080 --> 00:12.900]  That I have discovered thanks to HelloFresh. Are you ready to try America's number one meal kit?

[00:37.260 --> 00:43.080]  Hello, and welcome to episode 64 of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:43.460 --> 00:47.940]  I just realized I definitely don't think we did an intro the last one we just recorded.
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.020]  So just listen to this one twice. I'm Geoff Geoff.
[00:52.480 --> 00:55.120]  With me as always is Gavin Gavin and Andrew Andrew.
[00:55.420 --> 00:57.860]  Yo, did we not do an intro? I feel like we did.
[00:58.300 --> 01:02.800]  You know, we started it started with you and Eric fighting over NSYNC.
[01:02.800 --> 01:04.360]  Oh yeah. Top dogging NSYNC.
[01:04.460 --> 01:06.180]  And then I don't think we ever got around to it.
[01:06.220 --> 01:07.340]  Yeah, we said the number. We said 63.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.260]  Okay, well this is 64 then, if my math is correct.
[01:13.220 --> 01:18.420]  The principles of addition continue to function as described to me as a child.
[01:19.020 --> 01:21.160]  This is episode 64 of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:22.120 --> 01:26.560]  And I don't know about you boys, I still have three things left over to talk about
[01:26.560 --> 01:31.460]  from my previous list that we didn't get to because of the world's longest
[01:31.460 --> 01:33.080]  open water story.
[01:33.700 --> 01:36.420]  But I don't want to monopolize the episode either.
[01:36.480 --> 01:36.740]  No.
[01:36.940 --> 01:38.180]  If you guys want to talk about anything, go right ahead.
[01:38.500 --> 01:43.520]  No, I mean, if it's on par with the ocean rescue story, I need, I mean,
[01:43.520 --> 01:45.960]  I just need to know everything. I need to know how your day is.
[01:46.020 --> 01:47.260]  I need to have a continuation.
[01:47.820 --> 01:49.080]  Let me tell you about today.
[01:50.300 --> 01:54.840]  This is the portion of the, this is called Purple Nightmare.
[01:55.600 --> 01:58.380]  I feel like I want Andrew to guess what this is about.
[01:58.620 --> 02:00.580]  What do you think purple? That's a great idea.
[02:00.580 --> 02:02.060]  I would like you both to guess.
[02:02.340 --> 02:07.520]  I described it as a lucid waking nightmare, a purple lucid waking nightmare.
[02:07.820 --> 02:11.460]  I'm going to guess that you dreamt that you were on a boat
[02:11.460 --> 02:15.020]  and Grimace was yelling at you to go now, is my guess.
[02:15.380 --> 02:16.820]  I was thinking Barney.
[02:17.720 --> 02:19.620]  No, you're both so far off.
[02:19.700 --> 02:22.680]  When you say Purple Nightmare, it was this actually a nightmare?
[02:22.840 --> 02:25.920]  Or is this an experience that was real that you're just calling a nightmare?
[02:26.080 --> 02:28.900]  It was an experience that was so horrible, it felt like a nightmare.
[02:28.900 --> 02:36.540]  Okay, you're riding, you're riding your bike and you saw a lovely field of lavender to your side
[02:36.540 --> 02:37.700]  and you thought, oh, that looks nice.
[02:37.880 --> 02:43.680]  And then suddenly your bike just veered into it and you rolled down a hill through lavender,
[02:44.360 --> 02:46.580]  thus living a purple nightmare on the way down.
[02:46.580 --> 02:48.220]  I wish. I'm going to continue off that.
[02:48.300 --> 02:52.040]  I'm going to guess that Geoff was trying to do his bike trick, doing a practice run,
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.340]  trying to get into it, was listening to Prince while doing so, and it went horribly wrong.
[02:58.380 --> 03:00.420]  That is my second Purple Nightmare guess.
[03:00.420 --> 03:05.460]  I love the idea behind that. It's a little more pedestrian, unfortunately.
[03:06.740 --> 03:08.940]  So I thought I was going to have a good day today.
[03:09.240 --> 03:11.360]  And it's largely been a good day.
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.620]  What made you think that though?
[03:12.980 --> 03:16.060]  I just felt like it. I woke up in a good mood and I thought like today will be...
[03:16.060 --> 03:18.280]  I knew I had to go to the doctor. I hadn't been to the doctor in a while.
[03:18.360 --> 03:20.920]  And I wanted to go get some blood work done and, you know, just a wellness exam.
[03:21.140 --> 03:22.620]  So I went and got a tetanus shot.
[03:22.840 --> 03:25.460]  Because I figure if anybody on Earth needs a tetanus shot, it's me.
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.160]  And, uh...
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.780]  I mean, you did cut your hand open on something.
[03:29.060 --> 03:32.780]  Yeah, also, you know, you want to check your cholesterol and do all the stuff a man like
[03:32.780 --> 03:34.580]  myself has to do in his mid 40s.
[03:35.080 --> 03:38.560]  And so I was kind of looking forward to that because it's one of those things that you put
[03:38.560 --> 03:41.160]  off and you put off and I was glad to finally be doing it, you know.
[03:41.600 --> 03:44.960]  And so I had to leave kind of early to go to the doctors.
[03:45.920 --> 03:51.400]  And one thing I do when I have Millicent, you know, with joint custody, I have her half the time.
[03:51.400 --> 03:57.000]  So on the weeks that I have Millicent, every morning or virtually every morning, I make her
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.200]  a smoothie because she has some specific dietary requirements.
[04:02.640 --> 04:06.980]  And I've learned how to make this awesome smoothie that's really fun.
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.480]  And she seems to appreciate it.
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.220]  And it sets her up in the right way for her day.
[04:13.400 --> 04:15.020]  She's all full of nutrients and stuff.
[04:15.260 --> 04:17.880]  And anyway, so I was making her smoothie.
[04:18.280 --> 04:18.900]  What's in this smoothie?
[04:19.280 --> 04:20.120]  It's a blueberry smoothie.
[04:20.560 --> 04:21.760]  It's got a lot of stuff in it.
[04:21.760 --> 04:26.100]  But the main ingredients are blueberry and banana and peanut butter.
[04:26.360 --> 04:30.160]  And it was the yogurt that was that caused the initial problem.
[04:30.580 --> 04:32.080]  And some honey and some other stuff.
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.300]  Anyway, so I have this like ninja food, like smoothie maker machine.
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.420]  And it makes like a 20 ounce smoothie.
[04:38.620 --> 04:43.180]  And so I was talking to Emily this morning while she was getting ready for work.
[04:43.180 --> 04:44.880]  And I was making the smoothie and putting it all together.
[04:45.040 --> 04:49.300]  And I crammed it a little too full of yogurt, which I can't stand.
[04:49.300 --> 04:51.060]  So when I put the lid on...
[04:51.060 --> 04:52.380]  The way it works is you like fill it up.
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.200]  You put a lid on that's got the little fucking blades in it.
[04:56.260 --> 04:58.440]  Then you stick it on the machine and it goes...
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.700]  And it spins it all up.
[04:59.960 --> 05:01.920]  And so when I put the blades and I pushed it down,
[05:02.060 --> 05:05.220]  it fucking shot yogurt out of all the sides.
[05:05.620 --> 05:07.820]  Which if there's one thing I like less than yogurt,
[05:08.760 --> 05:12.700]  it's goopy yogurt coming out of the sides of a smoothie thing.
[05:12.920 --> 05:13.980]  It was like, I retched.
[05:14.060 --> 05:14.260]  I'm like...
[05:14.900 --> 05:16.020]  How does it come out of the sides?
[05:16.020 --> 05:20.760]  Because at the top where you screw it in, there was too much volume.
[05:20.940 --> 05:21.780]  And so it squirts.
[05:21.880 --> 05:23.400]  It's like yogurt squirt coming out of the top.
[05:23.540 --> 05:24.460]  That'd be a great way to describe it.
[05:24.920 --> 05:26.300]  Gross white yogurt squirt.
[05:26.660 --> 05:27.300]  And I was like...
[05:27.980 --> 05:32.520]  So I go over and I rinse it off.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.100]  And so now the canister is a little slippery and wet, right?
[05:38.480 --> 05:40.120]  Then I take it over to the smoothie machine.
[05:40.320 --> 05:41.760]  And I put it in the smoothie machine.
[05:43.520 --> 05:45.460]  And I get the smoothie all nice and blended.
[05:45.460 --> 05:46.780]  It's very purple.
[05:47.640 --> 05:51.300]  And then I go over back to the kitchen sink.
[05:51.580 --> 05:54.120]  Because some more yogurt squirt has come out.
[05:54.240 --> 05:55.260]  And so I take the cap off.
[05:55.340 --> 05:57.040]  And I'm trying to just clean it up a little bit.
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.340]  Get the yogurt squirt off of it and stuff.
[05:58.440 --> 06:01.380]  So that it's not disgusting for Millie.
[06:01.720 --> 06:04.260]  And I turn around with it in my hand.
[06:04.440 --> 06:07.240]  And I guess it just wasn't holding it well enough.
[06:07.320 --> 06:07.960]  And it was wet.
[06:08.220 --> 06:12.060]  And I throw the smoothie across the kitchen.
[06:12.860 --> 06:14.780]  And it hits the floor.
[06:15.200 --> 06:16.820]  And it explodes.
[06:17.700 --> 06:22.200]  And 20 ounces of purple smoothie makes...
[06:22.200 --> 06:25.400]  20 ounces of purple smoothie can cover an entire house.
[06:27.020 --> 06:29.080]  It can cover all of the floor.
[06:29.200 --> 06:31.300]  It can cover three different carpets.
[06:31.580 --> 06:34.240]  It can cover every kitchen cabinet.
[06:34.500 --> 06:38.100]  It can cover all of the walls.
[06:38.200 --> 06:40.120]  It can cover a lot of ceiling.
[06:40.120 --> 06:44.040]  You can paint a lot of ceiling with a 20 ounce purple smoothie.
[06:44.120 --> 06:47.440]  Uh, it's one of those, I don't know where to start kind of messes up.
[06:47.620 --> 06:48.840]  Which bit do you clean first?
[06:49.080 --> 06:50.540]  It went so far.
[06:51.040 --> 06:53.900]  It shot across the island of my kitchen.
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.600]  Gavin, you know where my...
[06:55.600 --> 06:56.420]  You've been in my house.
[06:56.560 --> 06:57.060]  So my kitchen.
[06:57.220 --> 07:01.540]  It shot over like the little cutout area on across the dining room table.
[07:01.660 --> 07:04.540]  It covered the windows in my living room.
[07:04.780 --> 07:10.100]  It did like a James McAvoy bullet bend around the wall.
[07:10.120 --> 07:13.720]  And managed to then spin back and hit my front door.
[07:14.180 --> 07:16.660]  Which isn't even visible from where it hit the ground.
[07:17.060 --> 07:23.320]  It sounds like when Mr. Bean tried to paint his flat by putting a firework in a can of paint.
[07:24.620 --> 07:26.480]  I didn't, I didn't see that.
[07:26.600 --> 07:29.300]  But uh, and I just like stared at it.
[07:29.680 --> 07:30.960]  And Emily was leaving.
[07:31.340 --> 07:33.300]  And I just went outside and said, you've got to come home.
[07:33.380 --> 07:33.880]  You've got to come back.
[07:33.900 --> 07:34.320]  She's like, what's wrong?
[07:34.340 --> 07:34.520]  What's wrong?
[07:34.620 --> 07:35.800]  I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[07:35.860 --> 07:36.340]  I don't know what to do.
[07:36.520 --> 07:37.560]  And she runs and she's like, what's wrong?
[07:37.600 --> 07:38.800]  And I go, what do I do?
[07:38.800 --> 07:41.820]  And she just goes, I gotta go to work.
[07:43.380 --> 07:44.400]  She's like, wake up Millie.
[07:44.480 --> 07:44.980]  She'll help you.
[07:45.040 --> 07:46.660]  And then she left because she had to go to work.
[07:46.720 --> 07:47.920]  She had clients in the chair or whatever.
[07:48.340 --> 07:49.540]  I know she filmed a video of it.
[07:49.640 --> 07:50.740]  So you guys can see that at some point.
[07:50.860 --> 07:55.880]  But uh, I, I then got up Millie and for 40 minutes, we cleaned purple.
[07:56.460 --> 07:58.180]  It was just everywhere.
[07:58.260 --> 08:01.760]  Every and every time I thought it was done, I would like move a dining room chair and
[08:01.760 --> 08:03.400]  realize no, the whole seat is full of purple.
[08:03.880 --> 08:06.480]  And uh, I had to clean three different rugs.
[08:06.480 --> 08:10.920]  I had to clean the ceiling in two rooms significantly.
[08:11.220 --> 08:14.320]  Uh, we've got to get you a security camera or something inside.
[08:14.700 --> 08:14.820]  Right.
[08:14.840 --> 08:20.320]  And then, and then after it was all done and I got it all clean, I walked into my bedroom
[08:20.320 --> 08:22.140]  and I sat down and I just cried.
[08:22.180 --> 08:26.780]  I cried for a good two minutes, just cried.
[08:27.120 --> 08:30.580]  And then I got up, I wiped off my tears.
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.440]  I went back in and I made another goddamn smoothie because Millie needed her breakfast.
[08:35.440 --> 08:37.540]  And so I made another goddamn smoothie.
[08:37.880 --> 08:41.540]  And then I, and I endeavored to have a better day after that.
[08:41.660 --> 08:45.380]  There's always just like an underlying level of tragedy to all your funny stories.
[08:46.400 --> 08:47.580]  Oh, was that today?
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.080]  Did that happen today?
[08:49.340 --> 08:50.760]  That happened at 9am today.
[08:51.220 --> 08:52.280]  What a start.
[08:52.540 --> 08:55.600]  You, and you thought it was going to be a good day, which means you probably only had
[08:55.600 --> 08:57.180]  an hour or two of thinking it was great.
[08:57.680 --> 09:03.040]  I was expecting the blender to have fired it out, but it was just you throwing it.
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.040]  I fucking threw it with like, like I threw it with like some force, dude.
[09:08.120 --> 09:10.120]  I don't even know how to describe it.
[09:10.140 --> 09:11.400]  Was it like a Gronk spike?
[09:11.540 --> 09:12.840]  Like, what are we taught as far as?
[09:13.080 --> 09:14.280]  Yeah, yeah, kind of like a Gronk spike.
[09:14.400 --> 09:15.060]  Yeah, there you go.
[09:15.200 --> 09:16.340]  That's a good way to describe it.
[09:16.380 --> 09:21.720]  Yeah, it was like, I've never been more shocked in my life.
[09:22.180 --> 09:24.340]  I was like, it was as bad, Gavin.
[09:24.480 --> 09:29.300]  And I recognize there was a story from years and years and years ago where I had,
[09:29.540 --> 09:32.100]  my dog had diarrhea and my Roomba ran over it.
[09:32.100 --> 09:36.540]  And it shot shit six feet up my walls, right?
[09:36.980 --> 09:38.500]  It wasn't cleaning up feces.
[09:38.740 --> 09:39.480]  I'll say that.
[09:39.620 --> 09:40.600]  So that was a bonus.
[09:40.960 --> 09:43.680]  But it was way more cleanup.
[09:44.280 --> 09:47.920]  It got way, it just like, it laughed at the Roomba shit story.
[09:47.980 --> 09:49.960]  It was like, I can top that easily.
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.760]  So in terms of grossness, it would probably rank a three behind the Roomba shit and the
[09:54.760 --> 09:55.820]  half dead cow.
[09:56.340 --> 09:58.820]  But in terms of spread, it would probably be number one.
[09:59.140 --> 10:00.500]  Yeah, it's a three behind those.
[10:00.500 --> 10:02.260]  It's death is easy.
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.300]  Number one in terms of difficulty cleaning up and spread.
[10:05.520 --> 10:07.780]  Yeah, it was a mother fucker.
[10:10.460 --> 10:15.100]  Oh, all my mail, my Alexa, my Alexa got covered.
[10:15.600 --> 10:17.780]  Just a drippy purple mess.
[10:17.820 --> 10:20.040]  All my mail is stained purple now.
[10:22.640 --> 10:25.820]  So then here's my next story.
[10:26.340 --> 10:27.460]  Regulation fart.
[10:27.940 --> 10:29.740]  So then I go to the doctor.
[10:30.040 --> 10:30.500]  I do all that.
[10:30.580 --> 10:31.040]  It's all fine.
[10:31.120 --> 10:31.420]  It's great.
[10:31.500 --> 10:32.060]  I like the doctor.
[10:32.300 --> 10:32.820]  He's a new doctor.
[10:33.020 --> 10:33.300]  Love him.
[10:33.400 --> 10:33.580]  Everything.
[10:33.720 --> 10:34.200]  Come home.
[10:34.440 --> 10:35.160]  I get some lunch.
[10:35.460 --> 10:36.520]  Have some chili-killers for lunch.
[10:36.600 --> 10:36.940]  It's delicious.
[10:37.000 --> 10:37.520]  Everything's going fine.
[10:37.700 --> 10:41.580]  Then I have a quick little meeting, a little work meeting, and sitting at my desk, having
[10:41.580 --> 10:42.200]  my work meeting.
[10:42.700 --> 10:44.880]  And there's about 10 minutes to go in the work meeting.
[10:45.260 --> 10:47.980]  And I have a, just a perfectly regulation fart.
[10:48.420 --> 10:48.980]  Quiet fart.
[10:49.180 --> 10:50.740]  So I feel comfortable doing it.
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.960]  I just like, move my chair.
[10:52.340 --> 10:54.320]  You know, nobody hears it because it was silent.
[10:54.760 --> 10:55.740]  Nothing feels amiss.
[10:55.980 --> 10:56.680]  Nothing weird.
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.040]  As I said, it wasn't a, I didn't have to push.
[10:59.280 --> 11:00.120]  It wasn't a hard fart.
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.000]  It wasn't a wet fart.
[11:01.180 --> 11:03.180]  It was just a perfectly regulation fart.
[11:03.520 --> 11:04.120]  So I fart.
[11:04.500 --> 11:05.480]  Don't even think anything about it.
[11:05.580 --> 11:06.180]  Forget about it.
[11:06.440 --> 11:08.100]  Finish my business in the meeting.
[11:08.280 --> 11:09.640]  Get up to go to the bathroom.
[11:09.980 --> 11:12.560]  Feel like, oh, I should, I should do a poo now.
[11:12.980 --> 11:13.580]  Walk over.
[11:13.960 --> 11:15.020]  Pull down my pants.
[11:15.620 --> 11:16.100]  Sit down.
[11:16.500 --> 11:19.420]  Realize there is a pile of shit in my pants.
[11:19.940 --> 11:20.340]  No!
[11:21.260 --> 11:22.220]  There's no way.
[11:22.380 --> 11:23.500]  How do you don't feel it?
[11:23.700 --> 11:25.060]  I shit my pants.
[11:25.060 --> 11:29.620]  And like a, like a little cow pie, a little like, like a cow pie.
[11:29.820 --> 11:31.700]  And I just didn't feel it.
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.340]  I don't understand.
[11:33.780 --> 11:34.620]  I don't understand.
[11:35.520 --> 11:36.620]  I don't understand.
[11:36.900 --> 11:39.900]  And it was like, it wasn't, it was like, oh no.
[11:40.160 --> 11:42.480]  It wasn't like a streak or a little bubble.
[11:42.500 --> 11:46.140]  It was like, there was weight, you know, it like weighed my underwear down.
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.940]  And I don't know how, I don't know how it happened.
[11:49.120 --> 11:52.880]  I don't know how a regulation fart had, had non-regulation results.
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.200]  And I don't know how I didn't discover it at all until it was way too late.
[11:58.860 --> 11:59.940]  So that was a quick trip.
[12:00.020 --> 12:01.200]  That was a shower and laundry.
[12:02.640 --> 12:06.020]  If Geoff didn't take a shit, it would still be in his pants.
[12:06.140 --> 12:06.920]  He wouldn't have known.
[12:07.140 --> 12:08.400]  Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[12:09.240 --> 12:13.780]  I had to check and make sure this very chair I'm sitting in didn't have shit in it.
[12:13.780 --> 12:14.840]  It didn't, it was fine.
[12:15.140 --> 12:16.180]  The pants contained it.
[12:16.460 --> 12:17.380]  But, uh, but yeah.
[12:17.840 --> 12:21.780]  How much time passed between regulation fart and shit discovery?
[12:21.780 --> 12:23.180]  10 to 11 minutes.
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.840]  So not, not enough time for it to sort of go hard.
[12:28.280 --> 12:28.880]  No, no.
[12:28.940 --> 12:29.720]  It was still pretty goopy.
[12:30.220 --> 12:32.580]  Oh, I'm, I'm honestly blown away that after the...
[12:33.300 --> 12:35.740]  So to date, when we're recording this, the episode where Andrew
[12:35.740 --> 12:40.200]  rips a Homer in his words at the end of the last episode, that came out yesterday.
[12:40.700 --> 12:45.620]  I am blown away, Andrew, that you had no repercussions from that wet, disgusting noise.
[12:46.040 --> 12:47.480]  It was funny.
[12:47.620 --> 12:49.280]  I think I, I texted it to you guys.
[12:49.360 --> 12:50.780]  I couldn't figure out that evening.
[12:50.780 --> 12:54.380]  I was just, it was like a home run derby in my ass all night.
[12:54.580 --> 12:57.500]  It was just, I couldn't, I couldn't stop.
[12:57.620 --> 12:58.840]  And I was like, what is going on?
[12:58.860 --> 12:59.620]  This is a regular.
[13:00.040 --> 13:05.120]  And then the next day after we recorded, I had a fiber one bar and then it just,
[13:05.240 --> 13:07.220]  it was like throwing another log in the fire.
[13:07.260 --> 13:10.400]  Like it came back and I was like, oh, I ate like three of these that night.
[13:10.900 --> 13:11.800]  That's what caused it.
[13:11.860 --> 13:12.860]  So you were fibered up.
[13:13.160 --> 13:17.100]  I was fibered up and it was unleashing non-regulation farts.
[13:17.400 --> 13:17.780]  Yes.
[13:18.000 --> 13:18.680]  Goddamn dude.
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.660]  By the way, the audience universally loves your farts.
[13:24.160 --> 13:24.700]  Congratulations.
[13:25.500 --> 13:27.140]  Huge win for fuckface.
[13:27.760 --> 13:30.180]  Zero, zero negative comments.
[13:30.660 --> 13:31.920]  R.E. Andrew's butt.
[13:32.620 --> 13:35.840]  I was amazed and it was joyous to see.
[13:36.760 --> 13:37.840]  I think we've got a good audience.
[13:38.100 --> 13:38.700]  I think we've got one.
[13:39.060 --> 13:43.000]  It's not an audience that like, uh, you know, turns them off in disgust.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.020]  It's, it's an audience full of embrace.
[13:45.020 --> 13:49.520]  Even with such a wet, disgusting fart.
[13:49.960 --> 13:50.400]  Penis.
[13:50.740 --> 13:54.460]  Speaking of, uh, speaking of audience, uh, that's one of the things I wanted to talk about.
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.860]  Oh, by the way, I should just say, I'm now terrified because I, I don't think I can trust
[13:58.860 --> 13:59.420]  my farts anymore.
[13:59.540 --> 14:01.480]  This is uncharted fart territory for me.
[14:01.640 --> 14:05.920]  If I can't trust a regulation fart, can I ever leave the house again?
[14:07.180 --> 14:07.620]  Yeah.
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.980]  I mean, would that be, would that be a fart that you would have taken the gamble on in
[14:11.980 --> 14:12.820]  an airport or something?
[14:12.920 --> 14:13.200]  Yeah.
[14:13.720 --> 14:14.060]  Wow.
[14:14.620 --> 14:16.140]  It was a regulation fart.
[14:16.560 --> 14:16.600]  It's dangerous.
[14:17.180 --> 14:20.660]  Just a normal bog standard regulation fart.
[14:20.860 --> 14:21.740]  You got to figure that out.
[14:22.760 --> 14:23.840]  That's going to get you.
[14:24.140 --> 14:24.440]  Yeah.
[14:24.540 --> 14:25.780]  I'm not excited about it.
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.600]  Uh, but anyway, speaking of the audience, I was, I wanted to talk about the twins.
[14:30.060 --> 14:32.960]  I feel so bad because we did the fuck.
[14:33.080 --> 14:36.000]  I feel so bad that they're probably going to eat my condiment.
[14:36.060 --> 14:38.460]  I feel really bad about that because they did the salads.
[14:38.940 --> 14:40.400]  You know, the twins, right?
[14:40.760 --> 14:43.400]  Uh, they, uh, the comment leavers.
[14:43.400 --> 14:47.020]  And I'm going to say comment receivers after this because they got a lot of love.
[14:47.500 --> 14:51.120]  They, uh, they took our four salads and they made them.
[14:51.240 --> 14:53.980]  And then they did a salad taste test to determine what the best salad was.
[14:54.220 --> 14:54.580]  The girls?
[14:54.940 --> 14:55.080]  Yeah.
[14:55.120 --> 14:55.400]  The girls.
[14:56.400 --> 14:57.120]  Oh, yeah.
[14:57.300 --> 14:58.580]  I didn't know that anyone had made them.
[14:58.860 --> 14:59.000]  Yeah.
[14:59.000 --> 14:59.820]  They made them.
[14:59.880 --> 15:02.660]  They videotaped a review and they put it all up on Twitter.
[15:02.880 --> 15:03.820]  They had pictures.
[15:03.940 --> 15:05.860]  By the way, mine was no offense to you guys.
[15:05.900 --> 15:07.360]  Mine was easily the most aesthetic.
[15:07.760 --> 15:10.820]  If it wasn't the best tasting, it was easily the most aesthetic.
[15:11.260 --> 15:11.880]  Where do I look at these?
[15:11.940 --> 15:12.600]  I'll send it.
[15:12.600 --> 15:13.720]  Well, you can link it to you.
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.120]  Uh, I appreciated that they acknowledged mine had great spirit.
[15:17.240 --> 15:20.620]  I feel like that was what I was going for in the dinner zimmer salad.
[15:21.060 --> 15:22.240]  Definitely not a taste.
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.320]  You, uh, one of the twins liked yours best and one of the twins liked mine best.
[15:27.620 --> 15:28.880]  I don't think anyone liked mine.
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.280]  I think they appreciated it.
[15:30.420 --> 15:31.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.380]  No, no, the spirit, as I said, I appreciated the spirit call it for it.
[15:35.380 --> 15:37.680]  As far as taste goes, it's a disaster.
[15:37.920 --> 15:38.820]  So were they ranked?
[15:39.220 --> 15:39.640]  They did.
[15:39.740 --> 15:40.540]  Yes, they ranked them.
[15:40.820 --> 15:41.360]  It's a great video.
[15:41.500 --> 15:42.060]  I'll send it to you.
[15:42.060 --> 15:42.960]  Yeah, send it to me.
[15:43.040 --> 15:43.340]  I want to see.
[15:43.540 --> 15:44.300]  It was awesome.
[15:44.580 --> 15:50.500]  They also, uh, they also, uh, set the, uh, waffle bomb on fire and, uh, and smelled it in a video
[15:50.500 --> 15:51.560]  not too long ago as well.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.720]  They may, they're, they're making better content out of our content than we are.
[15:58.240 --> 16:00.120]  I wonder if they'll make all the condiments.
[16:00.360 --> 16:01.040]  That's what I'm saying.
[16:01.080 --> 16:01.640]  I feel terrible.
[16:01.740 --> 16:04.460]  I didn't design mine with the thought anyone else would try it.
[16:04.860 --> 16:06.260]  Um, I feel bad.
[16:07.380 --> 16:09.740]  I mean, yours is also just atrocious, Gavin.
[16:09.820 --> 16:10.800]  I feel bad about that too.
[16:10.860 --> 16:11.800]  It's not a good...
[16:11.800 --> 16:12.880]  Tater tot condiment.
[16:13.100 --> 16:13.920]  Yeah, it wasn't good.
[16:14.240 --> 16:15.920]  Cocktail sauce, there's nothing wrong with it.
[16:15.980 --> 16:18.940]  Not for tater tots, it was a bad combo for tater tots.
[16:18.960 --> 16:20.260]  It's weird on a tot, I'll give you that.
[16:20.260 --> 16:20.480]  It is.
[16:20.480 --> 16:22.080]  But it's not, it's not terrible in general.
[16:22.540 --> 16:25.880]  Hey, do y'all think I could be invited back to the Slack at some point?
[16:25.880 --> 16:28.700]  That's, I'm so glad that you mentioned that, Geoff.
[16:29.060 --> 16:30.520]  I'm so, cause that's on my note.
[16:30.580 --> 16:35.580]  I wanted to bring up the fact that, so I sent, uh, in the episode that came out, we talked about
[16:35.580 --> 16:39.380]  the state songs, the ranking of those, and the motion picture song.
[16:39.380 --> 16:43.880]  I posted those, and then Gavin made a joke saying Tennessee,
[16:44.180 --> 16:46.540]  spelt 10 because Tennessee has 10 state songs.
[16:47.120 --> 16:51.560]  And my original, I thought was, Gavin should be removed from this channel for that joke.
[16:51.660 --> 16:52.420]  That was precious.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.640]  Which then made me realize, oh my God, Geoff still isn't in the Slack.
[16:57.820 --> 16:58.140]  And so he said...
[16:58.140 --> 16:59.000]  It's been a long time.
[16:59.340 --> 17:01.780]  Maybe we just have a one-in, one-out rule from this point.
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.360]  Well, here's the thing, you left out a protest, so I thought it would be
[17:06.360 --> 17:09.700]  unfair of us to then drag you back in out of your protest.
[17:09.800 --> 17:12.480]  So if you're out of protest, we'd love to have you back.
[17:12.580 --> 17:15.760]  I don't want to speak for everyone, but if you're willing to come back.
[17:15.860 --> 17:18.140]  The regulation Zimmer looks fricking delicious.
[17:18.500 --> 17:20.240]  Yeah, because I make good ass salads.
[17:20.560 --> 17:22.960]  That looks like an ama- mine looks like a fruit salad.
[17:23.100 --> 17:24.640]  That looks like too much apple in there.
[17:24.820 --> 17:26.680]  I know how to make a fucking salad, man.
[17:26.820 --> 17:28.060]  I eat them. I love them.
[17:30.260 --> 17:31.060]  Raymond's looks...
[17:31.580 --> 17:34.640]  Yeah, dude, it's a lot different.
[17:34.640 --> 17:37.280]  The blueberries next to the meat, this looks a bit weird.
[17:37.980 --> 17:38.740]  It's not good.
[17:39.660 --> 17:40.720]  It's not a good salad.
[17:41.360 --> 17:42.060]  Oh, Nick's looks healthy.
[17:42.300 --> 17:44.560]  You take that avocado off of Nick's and it looks delicious.
[17:45.120 --> 17:45.660]  It's a good salad.
[17:46.160 --> 17:49.340]  I mean, if you like avocado, I understand that it would be a bonus.
[17:49.580 --> 17:51.980]  But if you don't, it's a big detractor.
[17:52.080 --> 17:53.260]  So you want back in the Slack, Geoff?
[17:53.300 --> 17:54.780]  Just to clarify, we can add you back.
[17:55.200 --> 17:56.100]  We'd love to have you back.
[17:56.480 --> 17:57.160]  I have a question, though.
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.740]  Does Geoff get to see all the stuff we wrote while he was gone?
[18:00.120 --> 18:00.840]  I think so, yeah.
[18:00.900 --> 18:02.720]  I mean, it's up to him if he wants to scroll up.
[18:02.720 --> 18:03.840]  I don't think I do.
[18:03.840 --> 18:05.780]  I think it starts where I joined.
[18:05.900 --> 18:07.140]  I think I lose all my progress.
[18:07.420 --> 18:09.000]  That was a lot covered that we should probably fill you.
[18:09.060 --> 18:10.100]  Maybe we could just repaste it.
[18:10.600 --> 18:13.200]  Yeah, well, maybe it wasn't for me to see.
[18:15.980 --> 18:18.300]  Well, that's everything I had on my list.
[18:18.400 --> 18:21.020]  Now it's all I'm left with is the queries and insights,
[18:21.120 --> 18:25.160]  which I was just going to pepper in as we went.
[18:25.380 --> 18:27.500]  One of those, of course, was the twins.
[18:28.240 --> 18:29.400]  I have a question for you guys.
[18:29.440 --> 18:30.180]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[18:30.400 --> 18:30.760]  Okay.
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.320]  When I was in Mexico, on the island, there's a rule in Mexico.
[18:35.500 --> 18:38.040]  It's in every toilet on the island.
[18:38.180 --> 18:39.860]  They said, please, please don't flush toilet paper.
[18:40.500 --> 18:42.700]  It flushes as little toilet paper as possible.
[18:43.100 --> 18:44.660]  It's an island and the plumbing isn't great.
[18:45.160 --> 18:48.000]  So they want you to throw it in a waste bin.
[18:48.780 --> 18:54.320]  And that got me thinking, what if every person on the island flushed toilet paper
[18:54.320 --> 18:56.000]  at the exact same time?
[18:57.180 --> 18:58.360]  Would it blow up?
[18:58.360 --> 19:02.240]  I think all the pressure would funnel to like one toilet somewhere.
[19:02.420 --> 19:13.140]  Which got me thinking, what if every toilet on Earth was flushed at the exact same time?
[19:13.580 --> 19:16.120]  Think of it like a global shit-in.
[19:17.460 --> 19:21.380]  Poop or not, but everybody flushes a toilet at the exact same time.
[19:21.600 --> 19:22.860]  Would Earth implode?
[19:23.400 --> 19:25.040]  The planet just cracks in half.
[19:25.540 --> 19:28.260]  I mean, maybe not, but something has to happen, right?
[19:28.260 --> 19:35.080]  That means millions or billions of toilets flushing at the exact same time.
[19:35.240 --> 19:37.240]  It would have to have some sort of effect.
[19:37.720 --> 19:38.680]  What would that be?
[19:39.060 --> 19:40.240]  It would have to back up somewhere.
[19:40.560 --> 19:46.120]  Because all this water is currently stored and it's held up by gravity.
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.500]  So you've got all of gravity of all of these tanks just ready to drop water.
[19:52.040 --> 19:53.000]  Yeah, interesting.
[19:53.180 --> 19:56.060]  Geoff is describing this like the lamest project mayhem.
[19:56.060 --> 19:59.360]  Like he doesn't want to blow up the financial district.
[19:59.500 --> 20:02.120]  He just wants every toilet to flush at the same time.
[20:02.340 --> 20:03.600]  I just am curious what would happen.
[20:03.840 --> 20:05.380]  Has anybody ever done a study?
[20:05.680 --> 20:07.020]  We should Google it, find out.
[20:07.280 --> 20:09.260]  You want to do like flush across America?
[20:09.700 --> 20:14.740]  Yeah, are there any like civil engineers out there that would have any idea?
[20:15.100 --> 20:19.380]  Like what the ramifications would be if every toilet on a system,
[20:19.820 --> 20:22.640]  like on the same treatment facility or whatever, flushed?
[20:22.640 --> 20:26.600]  Would there be enough water to instantly return at all?
[20:26.920 --> 20:28.740]  Would it get overwhelmed?
[20:29.080 --> 20:35.000]  And would it be like in a movie when all the pipes start busting
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.640]  and like steam starts pushing me out?
[20:37.800 --> 20:40.180]  But it's just shit and piss everywhere.
[20:40.480 --> 20:43.080]  Like the scarecrow in Batman Begins.
[20:43.240 --> 20:43.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[20:44.060 --> 20:44.780]  Exactly like that.
[20:46.800 --> 20:50.720]  Lower level of the Titanic, but it's just because everybody flushed.
[20:51.280 --> 20:51.880]  Exactly.
[20:52.900 --> 20:55.140]  I wonder if you'd be able to see it from a plane.
[20:56.680 --> 20:58.560]  What would it look like?
[20:58.980 --> 20:59.980]  What would you be seeing?
[21:00.900 --> 21:02.640]  That the ground came in maybe?
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.140]  I don't know.
[21:04.980 --> 21:05.940]  I'd be like 20.
[21:06.120 --> 21:07.200]  What was that movie? 2012?
[21:07.660 --> 21:07.980]  Yeah.
[21:09.060 --> 21:11.140]  So if you're out there, if you're a comment leaver
[21:11.680 --> 21:13.700]  and you have any insights into what would happen
[21:13.700 --> 21:16.980]  if a million toilets cried out at once, let us know.
[21:17.480 --> 21:20.240]  Thankfully, not enough people listened to F*** Face
[21:20.240 --> 21:22.220]  to actually cause an environmental disaster.
[21:22.220 --> 21:23.600]  I'm not trying to cause one.
[21:23.720 --> 21:24.960]  I just am wondering what would happen.
[21:25.700 --> 21:26.980]  I'm not recommending this.
[21:27.180 --> 21:28.360]  I don't want to do this.
[21:28.620 --> 21:32.120]  I'm not espousing it as an idea that we should pursue.
[21:32.380 --> 21:33.500]  I'm just curious.
[21:34.340 --> 21:35.300]  I can't wait.
[21:35.440 --> 21:38.140]  We're going to get a response back like September 1st
[21:38.140 --> 21:39.600]  for how far ahead we are.
[21:39.680 --> 21:40.240]  What a time.
[21:40.920 --> 21:41.620]  We've been waiting for this.
[21:41.760 --> 21:43.860]  Just about three weeks after we forget about it.
[21:44.080 --> 21:45.340]  Yes, exactly.
[21:50.230 --> 21:51.310]  Well, the summer's here.
[21:51.370 --> 21:52.170]  You know what that means?
[21:53.270 --> 21:55.770]  Sweaty crotch, swamp ass.
[21:56.090 --> 22:00.050]  The living ain't easy unless you got a Hello Tushy bidet.
[22:00.570 --> 22:03.710]  You want to keep your sweaty crack clean all stinky summer long?
[22:04.090 --> 22:07.050]  Well, you want to use the brand new Hello Tushy 3.0
[22:07.050 --> 22:08.490]  modern bidet attachment.
[22:08.670 --> 22:09.410]  It is stylish.
[22:09.630 --> 22:13.330]  It is eco-friendly and your underwear will thank you.

[22:16.270 --> 22:17.610]  and it doesn't stop there.
[22:17.650 --> 22:19.570]  It also cleans itself like a champ
[22:19.570 --> 22:22.850]  with the Smart Spray automatic self-cleaning nozzle.

[22:47.190 --> 22:49.010]  Our noses will thank you.
[22:49.010 --> 22:54.370]  Here I am sharing my experience as things approach normalcy.
[22:54.910 --> 22:57.730]  Have I found myself feeling anxious and needing to calm down?
[22:57.850 --> 22:58.850]  Why, all the time.
[22:59.310 --> 23:01.990]  And that's why I use Raycon wireless earbuds.
[23:02.150 --> 23:03.230]  Like I go for bike rides.
[23:03.330 --> 23:04.610]  I try to go every day.
[23:04.970 --> 23:08.630]  Try to ride between 22 and 30.
[23:08.710 --> 23:11.750]  Well, it usually ends up being about 24 miles if I'm being honest.
[23:12.230 --> 23:16.430]  And I pop those suckers in and it kind of just helps me reset.
[23:16.590 --> 23:18.590]  Helps me work through problems I have.
[23:18.590 --> 23:20.090]  It's a little bit background music.
[23:20.350 --> 23:22.230]  Kind of drown out the world.
[23:22.330 --> 23:23.210]  Helps me center.
[23:23.890 --> 23:24.610]  I appreciate it.
[23:24.710 --> 23:26.070]  It kind of gets me back to where I need to be.
[23:26.390 --> 23:27.550]  But it's not just about calming down.
[23:27.670 --> 23:28.970]  Sometimes you need to be pumped up too.
[23:29.070 --> 23:32.450]  Like you need a badass playlist because you're about to go work out at the gym.
[23:32.530 --> 23:32.950]  I assume.
[23:33.050 --> 23:34.290]  Not me, but maybe Blaine.
[23:34.750 --> 23:38.130]  I know that I like to listen to instrumentals.
[23:38.670 --> 23:43.410]  Really good like kind of like modern jazz and just kind of weird stuff that just kind
[23:43.410 --> 23:47.730]  helps me surf my thoughts a little bit without being too distracted by
[23:48.630 --> 23:50.810]  what the music is saying or trying to tell me.
[23:51.130 --> 23:54.510]  But let me tell you right now, Raycons are the best way to listen.
[23:54.710 --> 23:58.170]  They come with a bunch of gel tips for your comfort and unlike some other brands,
[23:58.250 --> 24:03.170]  they don't stick out of your ears and make you look like a 1950s alien.
[24:03.470 --> 24:05.310]  Raycons have a 32-hour battery life.
[24:05.810 --> 24:08.690]  Well, I don't know how to count past 24.
[24:08.910 --> 24:10.530]  So it's more than a day.
[24:10.610 --> 24:11.210]  I'll tell you that.
[24:11.210 --> 24:15.730]  So you can listen to what you want when you want for a really long time.
[24:15.990 --> 24:18.490]  They start at half the price of other premium audio brands,
[24:18.670 --> 24:21.090]  but they sound just as good, which is awesome.
[24:21.350 --> 24:24.730]  You're basically paying half the price for just as good of a product.
[24:25.030 --> 24:28.230]  And they come with a 45-day happiness guarantee.
[24:28.430 --> 24:29.470]  So you really can't lose.
[24:29.710 --> 24:31.570]  Give them a try and you'll see what I mean.
[24:31.910 --> 24:33.570]  Create your own soundtrack with Raycon.
[24:50.070 --> 24:53.330]  I did a thing. I don't even know if I should talk about it.
[24:53.330 --> 24:55.590]  Maybe it would be satisfying if I talked about it,
[24:55.610 --> 24:59.070]  because they will know the results before I do at this point.
[24:59.210 --> 25:00.230]  It will be long over.
[25:00.270 --> 25:03.090]  By the time they hear about this, this will be a distant thing.
[25:03.090 --> 25:05.330]  The Olympics start in two days.
[25:05.890 --> 25:06.890]  I love the Olympics.
[25:07.010 --> 25:07.790]  Like the Spelling Bee.
[25:08.010 --> 25:10.730]  I tweeted out about how great that Spelling Bee was.
[25:10.830 --> 25:12.310]  People were like, is this a bit? Not a bit.
[25:12.630 --> 25:14.050]  Spelling Bee, a fantastic event.
[25:14.330 --> 25:17.110]  Not to derail your story, but that was fun.
[25:17.390 --> 25:23.130]  You and I hung out and we just texted all night watching the Spelling Bee together.
[25:23.390 --> 25:24.610]  And it was enthralling.
[25:25.090 --> 25:26.830]  I had the best time watching the Spelling Bee with you.
[25:27.010 --> 25:29.310]  It's a great event. People should watch it every year.
[25:29.430 --> 25:32.170]  It's a lot of fun, even if you're not doing ridiculous things
[25:32.170 --> 25:34.710]  like what my fantasy football league does.
[25:34.810 --> 25:37.870]  It's just a fucking awesome event to watch these people.
[25:38.130 --> 25:39.790]  There were so many intense moments.
[25:40.270 --> 25:43.970]  I've never seen someone go to spell the word and then ask for more
[25:44.610 --> 25:47.010]  clarifications on origin and whatnot.
[25:47.130 --> 25:47.930]  It was intense.
[25:48.030 --> 25:49.530]  The person who won almost lost.
[25:49.810 --> 25:50.450]  It's a great thing.
[25:50.770 --> 25:52.890]  I was at a social event.
[25:53.310 --> 25:56.410]  And I try not to spend too much time on my phone when I'm around real people.
[25:56.530 --> 25:57.990]  And I just had it down somewhere.
[25:57.990 --> 26:03.830]  And then I picked it up and there were like 175 new messages in the group chat.
[26:04.270 --> 26:08.390]  It was like reading someone's live tweet from like an Apple event or something.
[26:09.930 --> 26:11.010]  It was amazing.
[26:11.410 --> 26:13.250]  I couldn't believe what I was missing out on.
[26:13.450 --> 26:15.030]  There was like moments of tension in there.
[26:15.350 --> 26:15.790]  Oh, yeah.
[26:16.130 --> 26:16.810]  There were predictions.
[26:18.210 --> 26:20.910]  Andrew was convinced they were icing his guy out.
[26:21.050 --> 26:22.110]  He was very upset about it.
[26:22.550 --> 26:23.310]  I was outraged.
[26:23.390 --> 26:26.890]  My kid, they went to commercial break two times in a row on my kid.
[26:26.890 --> 26:27.870]  Just icing him.
[26:28.250 --> 26:29.410]  Just putting the pressure on him.
[26:29.650 --> 26:33.790]  I feel like that was a good enough read to the point where along the same lines as a
[26:33.790 --> 26:39.250]  break shit stream, we should just have like a live stream reaction or commentary to an
[26:39.250 --> 26:40.290]  event that's going on like that.
[26:40.430 --> 26:41.250]  I think it would be good.
[26:41.570 --> 26:43.510]  Yeah, well, I don't know.
[26:43.570 --> 26:46.170]  Maybe something, I don't know, we're going away and stuff.
[26:46.290 --> 26:47.510]  But so I love the Olympics.
[26:48.130 --> 26:48.950]  Fantastic event.
[26:49.350 --> 26:51.750]  I've gambled heavily on the Olympics this year.
[26:52.250 --> 26:53.770]  I'm excited to celebrate it.
[26:53.890 --> 26:55.330]  I didn't have much of a strategy.
[26:55.330 --> 26:59.510]  I just took the over for every country's medals that it would let me bet on.
[26:59.830 --> 27:01.210]  So I'm cheering for everybody.
[27:01.290 --> 27:02.010]  Not gold medals.
[27:02.370 --> 27:03.110]  I just need any medal.
[27:03.210 --> 27:04.370]  So this is my betting list.
[27:05.010 --> 27:09.750]  I have Canada, US, Australia, Belgium, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
[27:09.890 --> 27:13.510]  Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.
[27:14.070 --> 27:14.850]  All over the-
[27:14.850 --> 27:15.470]  Number of medals?
[27:15.910 --> 27:17.590]  This is number of medals earned.
[27:17.930 --> 27:18.330]  That is correct.
[27:18.950 --> 27:20.050]  How can you get half a medal?
[27:20.570 --> 27:23.030]  So that's, it's for setting the over under, right?
[27:23.030 --> 27:25.690]  So by putting a 0.5, you can't win half a medal.
[27:25.830 --> 27:28.510]  So it'll clearly be either above or below that number.
[27:28.750 --> 27:30.770]  So I'm going the over for everything.
[27:31.390 --> 27:34.570]  I don't know if that mathematically is even possible for all these bets to win,
[27:34.590 --> 27:35.750]  for going over.
[27:35.970 --> 27:36.710]  But I'm excited.
[27:37.110 --> 27:42.110]  This is going to be my next two weeks is watching basketball and rowing and track,
[27:42.530 --> 27:45.030]  just be terrified about medal placement.
[27:45.470 --> 27:49.150]  So if two people in Finland get bronze medals-
[27:49.150 --> 27:50.790]  Yeah, I'm all about Finland.
[27:50.790 --> 27:52.930]  I was like, 1.5 for Finland?
[27:53.050 --> 27:53.990]  That seems super low.
[27:54.130 --> 27:55.890]  Who are you most worried about?
[27:56.190 --> 27:58.790]  Finland, because it's 1.5.
[27:59.450 --> 28:00.230]  I had to look.
[28:00.330 --> 28:01.530]  They got 20 athletes in it.
[28:01.710 --> 28:02.510]  I'm excited, though.
[28:02.590 --> 28:06.710]  But by the time that people hear this, the Olympics are going to be over like a week ago.
[28:06.790 --> 28:08.350]  They ended over a week at this point.
[28:08.730 --> 28:10.650]  So they will know if I'm miserable.
[28:10.970 --> 28:14.470]  I wonder if Great Britain got their 44 and a half or not.
[28:14.910 --> 28:16.610]  Hopefully it doesn't come down to penalty kicks, right, Kevin?
[28:18.770 --> 28:19.750]  That was too soon, man.
[28:19.830 --> 28:20.430]  It's too soon.
[28:21.330 --> 28:22.250]  That was fantastic.
[28:22.670 --> 28:24.150]  Just watching the misery.
[28:24.370 --> 28:25.950]  And I didn't even know that was happening.
[28:26.370 --> 28:28.630]  I don't think we've talked about this in a regular F*** Face,
[28:28.690 --> 28:33.130]  but if you want to see my live reactions to England losing the 2020 Euro final,
[28:33.470 --> 28:36.770]  it's in our third- it's in our RTX BreakShed stream.
[28:37.310 --> 28:37.830]  It's on YouTube.
[28:39.690 --> 28:40.490]  Oh dear.
[28:40.650 --> 28:43.070]  But the timing of that, the timing of that stream.
[28:43.250 --> 28:43.650]  Unbelievable.
[28:44.150 --> 28:44.870]  It was fantastic.
[28:45.330 --> 28:45.590]  Yeah.
[28:45.890 --> 28:47.670]  Couldn't ask for a better setup for that.
[28:47.710 --> 28:48.070]  That was great.
[28:48.730 --> 28:50.310]  Oh, there's surfing in the Olympics?
[28:50.310 --> 28:50.990]  Yeah.
[28:51.150 --> 28:51.550]  There is.
[28:51.670 --> 28:52.470]  And skateboarding now.
[28:52.670 --> 28:54.490]  How do you get a gold medal at surfing?
[28:54.610 --> 28:56.770]  What are they scoring you on on surfing?
[28:57.850 --> 29:00.230]  I could guess, but I guess-
[29:00.230 --> 29:01.070]  It's like the same.
[29:01.130 --> 29:02.810]  It's the same way they surf in competitions.
[29:03.230 --> 29:07.790]  It's like complexity of the ride, you know, how many moves you do.
[29:08.210 --> 29:09.110]  Similar to skateboarding.
[29:09.430 --> 29:10.710]  Yeah, very similar to skateboarding.
[29:10.730 --> 29:10.910]  Okay.
[29:11.450 --> 29:14.590]  Yeah, I just never- I've never watched competitive surfing.
[29:15.770 --> 29:18.750]  I'm jazzed about the like sports that I give a s*** about
[29:18.750 --> 29:21.810]  being represented finally, like surfing and skating and that kind of stuff.
[29:21.910 --> 29:25.130]  Obviously basketball, but the USA men's basketball team sucks apparently.
[29:25.330 --> 29:26.170]  So we'll see.
[29:26.270 --> 29:27.890]  Yeah, they barely made it in, right?
[29:28.210 --> 29:28.410]  Yeah.
[29:28.790 --> 29:31.310]  1.5 medals for Finland is nuts.
[29:31.490 --> 29:32.910]  Like if they get two bronzes.
[29:33.250 --> 29:36.670]  Yeah, and not only is it like I didn't put the odds on that,
[29:36.730 --> 29:38.770]  that was like an unlikely thing to happen.
[29:39.010 --> 29:41.070]  They gave favorable odds that they wouldn't get two.
[29:41.550 --> 29:41.770]  So.
[29:41.990 --> 29:44.470]  So, Andrew, what are we looking at?
[29:44.770 --> 29:47.530]  Let's say if you hit every one of these, are you retiring?
[29:47.530 --> 29:51.310]  Not even- no, I just put one unit on every bet.
[29:51.610 --> 29:51.870]  Okay.
[29:52.130 --> 29:53.930]  So it's not a huge difference either way.
[29:54.010 --> 29:57.030]  I need about half of them to win to make the money back that I put down.
[29:57.850 --> 29:59.150]  So I feel okay about it.
[29:59.290 --> 30:00.070]  I'm sure you will.
[30:00.550 --> 30:01.470]  I- yeah, we'll see.
[30:01.590 --> 30:05.810]  I'm just excited to be up at 3 a.m. watching some random event that I typically wouldn't
[30:05.810 --> 30:08.010]  care about just yelling about medal placement.
[30:08.470 --> 30:08.910]  It's gonna be great.
[30:09.030 --> 30:10.010]  Russian handball all over again.
[30:10.190 --> 30:10.710]  It will be.
[30:10.810 --> 30:11.870]  Yeah, I love it.
[30:12.130 --> 30:12.870]  It's handball, isn't it?
[30:13.250 --> 30:13.930]  Handball is.
[30:14.270 --> 30:14.650]  Yeah.
[30:15.590 --> 30:15.970]  Interesting.
[30:16.610 --> 30:17.230]  It is interesting.
[30:17.530 --> 30:21.250]  I want to get in on this if there's any live discussion.
[30:21.630 --> 30:21.950]  Okay.
[30:22.390 --> 30:25.810]  Well, you're gonna be- that's the second conversation I had.
[30:25.930 --> 30:28.050]  So you're going to a foreign country.
[30:28.550 --> 30:30.730]  Are you going to have to quarantine still at this point?
[30:31.010 --> 30:31.210]  Yeah.
[30:31.550 --> 30:31.830]  Fuck.
[30:32.270 --> 30:33.430]  Okay, I was hoping that'd be no.
[30:33.950 --> 30:34.150]  Why?
[30:34.870 --> 30:40.290]  Well, because last time you said that you're going to be stuck for four or whatever days
[30:40.290 --> 30:42.390]  and you're just going to play outskirts.
[30:42.450 --> 30:43.390]  Play it outskirts, yeah.
[30:43.570 --> 30:47.210]  Yeah, so I just wanted to see if I could relax a little bit.
[30:47.210 --> 30:48.710]  Not have to think about outskirts.
[30:49.030 --> 30:51.470]  I think it's actually six days because-
[30:51.470 --> 30:51.710]  Fuck you.
[30:51.730 --> 30:54.170]  Technically, if I test negative on the fifth day...
[30:55.190 --> 30:58.730]  Oh, I think it's like seven days because then I'll be waiting like 24 hours for the result.
[30:58.970 --> 31:00.610]  But technically, the day you land is day zero.
[31:01.290 --> 31:04.750]  So yeah, I'm probably a week straight of outskirts.
[31:05.030 --> 31:05.770]  That's awful.
[31:06.110 --> 31:08.590]  People who are fully vaccinated don't have to quarantine,
[31:08.850 --> 31:10.950]  but only if they got vaccinated in the UK.
[31:11.630 --> 31:12.470]  What a dumb-
[31:12.470 --> 31:14.550]  Even though I got shot up with the same shit.
[31:16.290 --> 31:16.690]  Weird.
[31:17.210 --> 31:17.870]  It's annoying.
[31:18.290 --> 31:19.350]  That is a strange thing.
[31:19.730 --> 31:21.370]  I feel- I'm still processing.
[31:21.670 --> 31:23.570]  I was laughing so hard.
[31:23.690 --> 31:25.930]  The fact that Geoff or Gavin-
[31:25.930 --> 31:27.530]  How has your day been so far today?
[31:27.990 --> 31:28.970]  Just a normal day?
[31:29.390 --> 31:30.370]  You shit your pants or anything?
[31:30.670 --> 31:31.810]  That's what I'm kind of getting at.
[31:33.010 --> 31:34.190]  Pretty solid day, yeah.
[31:34.330 --> 31:38.510]  I mean, I had another COVID test, but it'll be like the 70th one, probably.
[31:38.670 --> 31:39.630]  Yeah, I got it yesterday.
[31:40.190 --> 31:41.110]  That's pretty normal at this point.
[31:41.390 --> 31:43.230]  Yeah, it's an uneventful day.
[31:43.490 --> 31:44.610]  You and I were just living our life.
[31:44.610 --> 31:49.270]  Geoff had a fucking die pack go off in his house, and he built a sandcastle in his shorts.
[31:49.490 --> 31:50.610]  And he's just here.
[31:50.870 --> 31:54.250]  I just keep processing how wildly different our days are.
[31:54.630 --> 31:55.070]  Yeah.
[31:55.890 --> 32:00.450]  And, uh, not that, like, abnormal of a day for me, either.
[32:00.730 --> 32:04.810]  It's, uh, I just don't always think to tell you all the dumb shit that happens.
[32:05.270 --> 32:06.910]  Because it's so commonplace.
[32:07.030 --> 32:09.550]  That's why I need a live feed to your life.
[32:09.550 --> 32:10.190]  Yeah.
[32:13.110 --> 32:14.710]  We have such different...
[32:14.710 --> 32:18.410]  Like, the last kitchen disaster I had was really...
[32:18.410 --> 32:20.870]  I got a rice cooker, like, over a year ago.
[32:21.030 --> 32:21.930]  Never used it.
[32:22.210 --> 32:23.430]  I was like, ah, I'm gonna...
[32:23.430 --> 32:26.130]  I was in a weird spot of, like, hungry, but didn't want to make a meal.
[32:26.430 --> 32:26.970]  Because it was late.
[32:27.510 --> 32:30.210]  So I put the rice in, did everything, hit start.
[32:30.390 --> 32:31.510]  One hour appeared.
[32:31.830 --> 32:33.090]  I was like, whatever, I'll wait an hour.
[32:33.710 --> 32:35.230]  Waited an hour, opened it up.
[32:35.230 --> 32:41.050]  I was more surprised than Morgan Freeman in 7 to open it up and see the rice uncooked.
[32:41.690 --> 32:42.470]  Like, it was just...
[32:42.470 --> 32:44.110]  It looked the exact same as I put it in.
[32:44.230 --> 32:46.350]  What I didn't realize is it wasn't a start button.
[32:46.390 --> 32:47.670]  It was a delay start button.
[32:48.070 --> 32:53.730]  So I clicked delay start for one hour, sat down there, just waited, and then opened it.
[32:53.830 --> 32:56.490]  Like, ah, rice time, not even slightly cooked.
[32:56.550 --> 32:58.190]  It then turned on after the fact.
[32:58.230 --> 33:01.170]  I had to wait two hours to make my cup of rice.
[33:01.790 --> 33:02.990]  It was dreadful.
[33:03.230 --> 33:04.750]  But it's like, it's a contained issue.
[33:04.750 --> 33:06.650]  I don't have shit on my walls.
[33:06.790 --> 33:08.130]  I don't have things exploding.
[33:08.710 --> 33:12.850]  I will say, the last time we recorded, you had a pretty intense issue with a tea kettle.
[33:13.330 --> 33:15.930]  The tea kettle ramen scenario wasn't bad.
[33:16.110 --> 33:16.990]  Oh my god, I forgot about that.
[33:17.930 --> 33:19.550]  I was looking at the pictures this morning.
[33:21.250 --> 33:22.810]  That was a disaster, but yeah.
[33:22.850 --> 33:25.690]  And I've learned, like, since then that that's like a $200 kettle.
[33:26.250 --> 33:27.450]  That's some fancy shit.
[33:27.970 --> 33:28.790]  It's a nice kettle.
[33:29.150 --> 33:31.830]  Yeah, dude, you're flexing, your kettle flex was pretty intense.
[33:32.630 --> 33:34.570]  What's the kettle flex?
[33:35.170 --> 33:35.830]  It's a nice kettle.
[33:36.590 --> 33:36.850]  Yeah.
[33:38.410 --> 33:41.090]  Yeah, I was, uh, I just had a pretty, pretty nice day.
[33:41.190 --> 33:42.910]  I was rendering footage of it, it was taking ages.
[33:42.990 --> 33:45.690]  So I just, I just thought I'd quickly watch Jurassic Park.
[33:46.010 --> 33:46.870]  It was a good movie.
[33:47.190 --> 33:48.650]  I realized, I've seen that movie.
[33:48.770 --> 33:50.690]  I must've, well, I saw it way more times as a kid.
[33:50.790 --> 33:52.610]  Maybe like, I must've seen it like 15 times.
[33:53.010 --> 33:56.290]  I don't think I ever realized what the movie is about.
[33:56.490 --> 33:58.090]  Or like why the movie happens.
[33:58.470 --> 34:00.370]  Because it's always like a plot of a movie, right?
[34:00.370 --> 34:02.210]  The main plot is, you know, man.
[34:02.250 --> 34:02.550]  Yeah.
[34:03.310 --> 34:05.810]  Rebirth dinosaurs and it goes against nature.
[34:05.890 --> 34:06.730]  Nature fights back.
[34:06.910 --> 34:08.510]  Dinosaurs don't do it.
[34:08.770 --> 34:10.170]  Are you talking the mosquito thing?
[34:10.310 --> 34:11.410]  Like the origin of it?
[34:11.490 --> 34:11.870]  Is that-
[34:11.870 --> 34:12.270]  Not even that.
[34:12.510 --> 34:17.670]  I didn't realize that movie happens because the guy that dies at the beginning,
[34:18.170 --> 34:20.050]  the guy that gets sucked into the raptor pen,
[34:20.430 --> 34:23.910]  his family is suing the park for $20 million.
[34:24.570 --> 34:26.310]  And the investors are pulling out.
[34:26.310 --> 34:30.810]  And John Hammond needs two experts to sign off on the safety of the park.
[34:30.990 --> 34:33.130]  Don't think I ever paid attention to that.
[34:33.390 --> 34:36.190]  You could summarize movies in a way that doesn't reveal...
[34:36.190 --> 34:37.270]  Well, I guess that would kind of give it away.
[34:37.430 --> 34:41.030]  But there's like really ignorable plot in movies.
[34:41.190 --> 34:44.190]  And I feel like I want to go through all the movies I've seen a load of times
[34:44.570 --> 34:47.110]  and like write down the plot of why they actually take place.
[34:47.490 --> 34:50.030]  I'll be honest, dude. You just blew my mind.
[34:50.190 --> 34:51.170]  Yeah. I had no idea.
[34:51.710 --> 34:53.010]  I've seen that movie so many times.
[34:53.010 --> 34:57.830]  Either it's just like the unmemorable crap, like you're a kid, you're watching,
[34:57.970 --> 35:00.430]  it's like, man, I wish the helicopter would land on the freaking island.
[35:00.550 --> 35:02.990]  We see some damn dinosaurs and you don't see any,
[35:03.070 --> 35:05.150]  you don't really listen to any of the exposition.
[35:05.710 --> 35:10.070]  I'm sure, uh, I'm sure minor league fan Jack is fucking going like,
[35:10.130 --> 35:14.050]  Oh, how did you not know? I can't believe it. It's right there in front of you.
[35:14.250 --> 35:18.310]  If we called Jack, do you think he would know now why Jurassic Park starts?
[35:18.670 --> 35:21.910]  Yes. And I want somebody else to do it because I'm not going to be responsible
[35:21.910 --> 35:24.210]  for piping and Jack again after the last one.
[35:24.650 --> 35:26.230]  Just tell him to count it.
[35:26.250 --> 35:27.830]  So you do it.
[35:28.210 --> 35:29.730]  I, I don't.
[35:30.270 --> 35:31.750]  Let me see if he's on discord right now.
[35:32.070 --> 35:35.250]  I'm trying to think if any is, I wouldn't know.
[35:37.070 --> 35:41.530]  Is that the most exciting legal dispute of all time as far as genre as a movie?
[35:42.650 --> 35:45.090]  Name a more thrilling legal movie.
[35:45.630 --> 35:46.590]  It's a lawsuit movie.
[35:46.710 --> 35:47.590]  Kramer versus Kramer.
[35:48.090 --> 35:48.450]  Liar, liar.
[35:48.910 --> 35:50.310]  Is liar, liar thrilling?
[35:50.930 --> 35:52.490]  That's just like funny, isn't it?
[35:52.570 --> 35:53.610]  I'm Gary Glynn Ross.
[35:54.070 --> 35:55.550]  That's not a thrilling movie.
[35:56.290 --> 35:58.950]  That is, uh, dialogue heavy.
[35:59.050 --> 35:59.790]  There's no...
[35:59.790 --> 36:00.570]  The Pelican Brief.
[36:01.110 --> 36:01.810]  I haven't seen it.
[36:02.090 --> 36:02.650]  The Firm.
[36:03.350 --> 36:04.070]  Eero Brockovich.
[36:04.470 --> 36:05.950]  What is the plot of the Pelican Brief?
[36:06.630 --> 36:07.450]  Fuck, I don't know, dude.
[36:07.570 --> 36:08.230]  I saw it when I was a kid.
[36:08.670 --> 36:09.270]  I was just asking.
[36:09.370 --> 36:12.030]  I was really hoping it was like a pelican stole a briefcase and then...
[36:12.030 --> 36:12.730]  Yes, that's what it is.
[36:12.750 --> 36:13.330]  A Few Good Men.
[36:13.430 --> 36:13.990]  That's a good one.
[36:14.250 --> 36:14.850]  That's a good one.
[36:15.030 --> 36:15.470]  Nick Scout.
[36:15.730 --> 36:16.450]  My Cousin Vinny.
[36:16.670 --> 36:17.670]  That won an Academy Award.
[36:18.030 --> 36:18.850]  Excellent point, Nick.
[36:19.050 --> 36:19.490]  It's a good one.
[36:19.490 --> 36:26.210]  I bet you Jurassic Park is the only movie that features both a law dispute, like a lawsuit,
[36:26.490 --> 36:27.090]  and dinosaurs.
[36:29.730 --> 36:31.830]  Which I know is a very specific genre.
[36:32.570 --> 36:34.270]  There's not a lot to go with, but...
[36:35.090 --> 36:35.950]  You just don't...
[36:35.950 --> 36:37.490]  There's not a crossover you anticipate.
[36:38.170 --> 36:39.150]  All right, I'm looking...
[36:39.150 --> 36:39.890]  I'm gonna text...
[36:39.890 --> 36:42.210]  Let me text Minor League Fan Jack right now.
[36:42.290 --> 36:42.870]  Oh, I texted him.
[36:42.890 --> 36:44.410]  He said, in just a minute, I could.
[36:44.750 --> 36:47.030]  Okay, well, tell him yes, then fucking get his shit together.
[36:47.570 --> 36:49.230]  Andrew, I'm gonna need you to...
[36:49.230 --> 36:51.210]  I just realized.
[36:51.410 --> 36:58.230]  I'm gonna need an Andrew Panton list of the most thrilling legal battles in film of all time.
[36:59.190 --> 37:00.310]  I don't have that.
[37:00.650 --> 37:05.290]  Well, I don't expect you to have it right now, but I expect you to come back with it at some point.
[37:05.450 --> 37:06.010]  And then we can put it...
[37:06.010 --> 37:06.310]  I'm thinking about it.
[37:06.570 --> 37:08.910]  All these lists are perfect for the zine.
[37:09.370 --> 37:10.270]  That's a great point.
[37:10.290 --> 37:11.070]  I forgot about the zine.
[37:11.070 --> 37:12.090]  That's a great point.
[37:12.110 --> 37:12.690]  As did I.
[37:13.650 --> 37:14.370]  I don't...
[37:14.370 --> 37:14.990]  I don't have that.
[37:15.070 --> 37:16.070]  I do have...
[37:16.070 --> 37:17.090]  I do have a new list.
[37:17.510 --> 37:18.710]  I do have a new ranking thing.
[37:18.710 --> 37:19.710]  This will come out.
[37:19.870 --> 37:21.610]  NFL preseason just started.
[37:22.150 --> 37:23.310]  NFL touchdown songs.
[37:23.450 --> 37:24.470]  The definitive list.
[37:24.530 --> 37:26.070]  I listen to all of them.
[37:26.450 --> 37:27.090]  Some of them...
[37:27.810 --> 37:30.310]  I mean, there's 32 teams, so...
[37:30.310 --> 37:31.870]  Hail to the redacted.
[37:32.570 --> 37:33.850]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's...
[37:33.850 --> 37:37.190]  They changed their name, but they're too lazy to change their song.
[37:37.490 --> 37:38.930]  It's very clear what it is.
[37:39.170 --> 37:39.450]  Yeah.
[37:40.290 --> 37:42.630]  Number one, the next episode, which is not...
[37:42.630 --> 37:45.010]  That's the Snoop Dio motherfucking G song.
[37:45.090 --> 37:48.390]  I don't feel like many people relate the title of the next episode to that song.
[37:48.390 --> 37:49.370]  Great song.
[37:49.530 --> 37:51.730]  New Orleans Saints from the Saints go marching in.
[37:51.850 --> 37:53.150]  It's a shit talk type thing.
[37:53.250 --> 37:54.690]  Like, if the running back goes...
[37:54.690 --> 37:55.230]  It's great.
[37:55.590 --> 37:56.390]  It's a great combination.
[37:56.550 --> 37:57.810]  I have a Seattle Seahawks bias.
[37:58.450 --> 37:59.470]  Las Vegas Raiders.
[37:59.530 --> 38:00.590]  Raider Nation is fine.
[38:00.670 --> 38:01.650]  It's an Ice Cube song.
[38:02.190 --> 38:03.090]  I mean, there's just...
[38:03.090 --> 38:04.190]  A lot of these are generic.
[38:04.570 --> 38:08.350]  I didn't know the Jacksonville Jaguars is an actual song, but I described it as sounds
[38:08.350 --> 38:11.090]  like when the Power Rangers form into a big robot to kick ass.
[38:11.350 --> 38:12.850]  That's the vibe you get from it.
[38:13.250 --> 38:15.970]  I think it's called Brohim, though, upon further research.
[38:16.370 --> 38:16.850]  It was that.
[38:16.850 --> 38:19.710]  The Miami Dolphins is a wild one.
[38:20.590 --> 38:24.330]  They use their fight song, which they made in, like, the 70s.
[38:24.410 --> 38:26.950]  And they just lie to their fans every time they score.
[38:27.410 --> 38:29.250]  It's like Miami Dolphins are number one.
[38:29.510 --> 38:31.130]  They always think about winning a Super Bowl.
[38:31.210 --> 38:32.630]  They're the best team that's ever existed.
[38:33.090 --> 38:36.250]  I struggled to find a thing that the Dolphins were number one at.
[38:36.610 --> 38:37.370]  Just in any way.
[38:38.370 --> 38:38.810]  Any...
[38:39.470 --> 38:40.390]  I lost Andrew.
[38:40.770 --> 38:41.710]  I lost Andrew, too.
[38:41.770 --> 38:43.050]  I thought I lost me.
[38:43.210 --> 38:44.930]  And I was about to be, goddammit.
[38:44.930 --> 38:46.450]  Because I just...
[38:46.450 --> 38:47.890]  I was explaining to them before you got on.
[38:48.010 --> 38:49.650]  I had my internet fixed yesterday.
[38:49.770 --> 38:50.250]  And the guy...
[38:50.250 --> 38:51.470]  It took about three and a half hours.
[38:51.630 --> 38:53.830]  And I'm reasonably certain that nothing improved.
[38:54.270 --> 38:54.390]  Ah.
[38:54.650 --> 38:54.850]  Wait.
[38:56.070 --> 38:57.030]  Because I've been, you know...
[38:57.030 --> 38:58.930]  I lose you guys for about a minute at a time sometimes.
[38:59.010 --> 38:59.950]  But it hasn't happened today.
[39:00.310 --> 39:03.410]  Also, Andrew just told me something while he's gone.
[39:03.450 --> 39:04.110]  I'm going to cover for him.
[39:05.030 --> 39:08.410]  Jacksonville Jaguars' song number eight, Brohim.
[39:08.530 --> 39:10.010]  When he said that, I recognized that song.
[39:10.230 --> 39:12.430]  That's a song by a punk band called Pennywise.
[39:12.690 --> 39:14.110]  A SoCal punk band.
[39:14.270 --> 39:15.430]  Oh, is it 90s?
[39:15.670 --> 39:16.690]  No, it's a song.
[39:16.790 --> 39:20.310]  Like, I'm assuming the Jaguars are using the actual punk rock song, Brohim.
[39:20.450 --> 39:20.850]  Hey, Andrew's back.
[39:21.130 --> 39:21.590]  Hey, I'm back.
[39:21.630 --> 39:22.290]  Where did I get...
[39:22.290 --> 39:23.750]  When did I disconnect?
[39:24.090 --> 39:24.630]  What happened?
[39:24.710 --> 39:25.530]  Because I kept going.
[39:25.530 --> 39:26.770]  You were talking about the Dolphins.
[39:26.910 --> 39:28.630]  But, dude, you said Brohim?
[39:28.950 --> 39:29.510]  So, like...
[39:29.670 --> 39:31.770]  The punk rock song, Brohim, by the band Pennywise.
[39:31.810 --> 39:32.370]  That's a great song.
[39:32.610 --> 39:33.010]  It is.
[39:33.250 --> 39:37.730]  But the Detroit Lions song I would recommend is fantastic.
[39:37.750 --> 39:39.870]  If you're going to listen to one touchdown song,
[39:40.190 --> 39:42.050]  listen to the Detroit Lions touchdown song.
[39:42.410 --> 39:43.230]  It is wonderful.
[39:43.230 --> 39:47.010]  It sounds like the band was, like, in the arena,
[39:47.270 --> 39:49.690]  and they're watching the game, and they missed the touchdown,
[39:49.930 --> 39:52.250]  and the only guy on alert was the horn guy.
[39:52.510 --> 39:53.990]  Because it's just, like...
[39:55.650 --> 39:59.990]  And then a pause, and then a second one, and then a third one,
[40:00.170 --> 40:03.530]  and then a band kicks in with, like, three seconds left into the song.
[40:03.770 --> 40:06.290]  So it's just, like, imagining the horn guy just yelling, like,
[40:06.450 --> 40:09.170]  My God, please get to the drums!
[40:09.490 --> 40:10.690]  Somebody do something!
[40:10.950 --> 40:12.630]  I can't hold this myself!
[40:12.630 --> 40:15.730]  And then, like, the music comes in at the last second. It's great.
[40:16.190 --> 40:17.970]  And up there, it's so shitty.
[40:18.190 --> 40:18.810]  Yeah, exactly.
[40:19.050 --> 40:23.690]  It sucks as a song, but just the context or the vibe that it gives you
[40:23.690 --> 40:24.630]  is why it ranks so high.
[40:24.710 --> 40:25.650]  It is really dumb.
[40:26.010 --> 40:27.150]  It's a fantastic song.
[40:27.570 --> 40:31.790]  I read that there's a lot of LA sports teams, across multiple sports,
[40:31.830 --> 40:36.130]  who always play I Love LA by Randy Newman at sporting events.
[40:36.550 --> 40:40.250]  But that song is about how much LA sucks, isn't it?
[40:40.250 --> 40:44.270]  Isn't that a song that's, like, all this shit stuff that's in LA?
[40:44.390 --> 40:45.370]  It's, like, an ironic song.
[40:45.810 --> 40:47.630]  I feel like maybe they don't understand it.
[40:47.950 --> 40:48.290]  Yeah.
[40:48.770 --> 40:53.330]  I can't believe you ranked Prince's Let's Go Crazy as number 30.
[40:53.590 --> 40:55.490]  Well, because it's, like, the way it's mixed.
[40:55.650 --> 40:57.130]  You gotta understand that these aren't mixed.
[40:57.170 --> 40:58.370]  These aren't just the songs.
[40:58.530 --> 41:00.470]  It sounded like I couldn't tell what it was initially.
[41:00.830 --> 41:03.530]  I thought, wait a second, are the Vikings doing the Ducktales theme
[41:03.530 --> 41:04.510]  as their touchdown song?
[41:04.530 --> 41:05.710]  Because that would be quite the move.
[41:06.090 --> 41:07.730]  And it's Let's Go Crazy by Prince.
[41:07.730 --> 41:09.410]  That's not a judgment of the song.
[41:09.490 --> 41:10.790]  It's how it's used for the touchdown.
[41:11.190 --> 41:12.550]  Makes sense. Thank you for the clarification.
[41:13.250 --> 41:16.750]  Song in an EA sports game that you've never heard outside of it.
[41:17.110 --> 41:19.410]  Yeah, and if you hear that, that's exactly...
[41:19.410 --> 41:21.930]  If you played EA sports games, you would get that vibe as well.
[41:22.030 --> 41:27.070]  What's fascinating is Green Bay, the Colts, and the Bengals
[41:27.070 --> 41:30.330]  all have the same touchdown song, which is that, um,
[41:30.690 --> 41:31.590]  I don't want to go to work.
[41:31.610 --> 41:33.130]  I just want to bang on my drum all day.
[41:33.330 --> 41:34.530]  That's their touchdown song.
[41:34.530 --> 41:37.790]  Is that why you've written drum banging original asterisk?
[41:38.210 --> 41:42.090]  Yes. So what you listen to it, and the first two I heard,
[41:42.210 --> 41:44.950]  it was the Bengals and the Packers,
[41:45.090 --> 41:46.930]  and they just have an instrumental track of it.
[41:46.990 --> 41:47.890]  They don't have any lyrics.
[41:48.290 --> 41:50.830]  The Colts have like a horn at the beginning.
[41:51.090 --> 41:54.230]  They include the lyrics and they remix it a little bit.
[41:54.310 --> 41:56.430]  So it became a question of who used it first.
[41:56.470 --> 41:57.190]  Was it the Colts?
[41:57.310 --> 41:58.470]  And then the other two swooped in,
[41:58.510 --> 42:01.850]  because I think teams somewhat frequently change their touchdown song.
[42:02.170 --> 42:04.210]  That's something that a lot of teams necessarily are married to.
[42:04.530 --> 42:06.890]  But it's, as I guessed, the Colts,
[42:06.950 --> 42:09.150]  it's like when you try to copy your friend's homework
[42:09.150 --> 42:11.210]  and you just make the minimal amount of changes.
[42:11.210 --> 42:12.350]  So it's not recognizable.
[42:12.770 --> 42:16.770]  They stole the Packers song in like 2014, which was that,
[42:16.890 --> 42:18.790]  and they just slightly edited it.
[42:18.870 --> 42:21.850]  So it'd be a little bit unique, but it's just the song.
[42:22.290 --> 42:23.010]  It's a lot of history.
[42:23.130 --> 42:24.690]  The Miami Dolphins fight song,
[42:24.990 --> 42:26.330]  this sort of like random tangent,
[42:26.430 --> 42:28.630]  the guy that wrote it got like no credit for it.
[42:28.670 --> 42:30.530]  And he's now a defense attorney in Tennessee.
[42:30.530 --> 42:34.630]  And he is the creator of one of the most iconic,
[42:34.890 --> 42:36.650]  like he got his band together.
[42:36.870 --> 42:39.590]  They recorded it, sent a bunch of demos out in Miami,
[42:40.010 --> 42:40.850]  waited a few months.
[42:40.950 --> 42:41.670]  He called his friend like,
[42:41.750 --> 42:44.070]  hey, have you heard a song called Miami Dolphins number one?
[42:44.450 --> 42:46.830]  And his friend was like,
[42:47.030 --> 42:49.410]  if I hear that song one more time, I'm going to kill somebody.
[42:49.610 --> 42:51.770]  He had no idea that the song was getting a play.
[42:51.870 --> 42:53.290]  It was the biggest song in Miami.
[42:53.710 --> 42:55.030]  And he just had no clue.
[42:55.130 --> 42:56.870]  Nobody would believe that he wrote the song.
[42:56.930 --> 42:57.670]  It was so iconic.
[42:57.870 --> 42:58.570]  Like he called his friend,
[42:58.570 --> 43:00.870]  I wrote that and his friend was like,
[43:00.990 --> 43:01.950]  you're full of shit.
[43:02.030 --> 43:05.730]  There's no way because you're just a random musician in the middle of LA.
[43:05.910 --> 43:08.830]  There's no way you created the Miami Dolphins iconic song.
[43:08.950 --> 43:13.690]  So we had to fly to Miami and buy a record of it to show proof that this is my name.
[43:14.110 --> 43:17.330]  I made this song that dolphins wouldn't do shit for them.
[43:17.630 --> 43:18.850]  They refuse to pay for it.
[43:18.890 --> 43:20.510]  They're like, we're just going to continue to use it.
[43:20.610 --> 43:22.210]  We're not even going to recognize you.
[43:22.330 --> 43:24.310]  So he said, fuck you, Miami.
[43:24.310 --> 43:28.130]  And he went to Houston and he re-recorded the same song
[43:28.130 --> 43:31.470]  and tried to sell it to the Houston Oilers, which is now a defunct franchise.
[43:32.210 --> 43:34.030]  And it sounds slightly different.
[43:34.170 --> 43:37.050]  And you think like, oh, he did it because he wanted a musical change.
[43:37.190 --> 43:41.950]  What happened was he hired a bunch of musicians who all showed up stoned
[43:41.950 --> 43:43.750]  and they brought the wrong instrument.
[43:43.950 --> 43:45.810]  So it just like made do with what they had.
[43:45.850 --> 43:49.030]  So there's a random horn in it because the guy brought a horn for some reason.
[43:49.230 --> 43:49.910]  It's absurd.
[43:50.010 --> 43:54.070]  It's an absurd time, but he was able to sell it to the Oilers, but then they died.
[43:54.070 --> 43:57.590]  So all he's made is like $1,500 from this song.
[43:57.670 --> 44:00.290]  All he got from Miami was two game tickets.
[44:00.430 --> 44:02.590]  He got free tickets to a game in the 90s.
[44:02.990 --> 44:03.990]  That's all the compensation.
[44:04.570 --> 44:09.270]  Nobody knows who he is, but he wrote one of the most iconic football songs
[44:09.270 --> 44:13.330]  that is played every time Miami scores at home since like the 70s.
[44:13.630 --> 44:14.590]  What's this person's name?
[44:14.950 --> 44:15.970]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[44:16.150 --> 44:17.190]  I don't remember.
[44:17.530 --> 44:19.810]  It's the least memorable name of all time.
[44:20.190 --> 44:20.830]  I forgot.
[44:20.830 --> 44:23.310]  This guy deserves the recognition.
[44:23.490 --> 44:25.450]  Don't bother remembering his name though.
[44:25.610 --> 44:28.890]  No, I've read like four stories on the guy.
[44:28.990 --> 44:30.750]  I've tried. I can't remember his name.
[44:30.910 --> 44:33.890]  It's the opposite of the basket weaver whose name you knew,
[44:34.010 --> 44:36.150]  but you didn't know anything else about him.
[44:36.330 --> 44:38.150]  I know everything about him, but his name.
[44:39.430 --> 44:40.610]  What, you want to guess it?
[44:44.910 --> 44:47.010]  I feel like it might be Igor.
[44:47.450 --> 44:49.110]  We're going to go with an Igor.
[44:52.430 --> 44:53.270]  Igor Patterson.
[44:53.410 --> 44:55.290]  Igor Patterson, the writer.
[44:55.290 --> 44:58.330]  Guessing is so much more insulting considering we live in a time
[44:58.330 --> 45:00.130]  where you could find out in one second online.
[45:00.450 --> 45:02.550]  Faster than it took you to make up a name, probably.
[45:02.930 --> 45:03.330]  Probably.
[45:03.770 --> 45:09.590]  I will say, by the way you're describing life continually kicking this guy in the dick,
[45:09.990 --> 45:11.570]  I feel like I'd get along really well with him.
[45:11.650 --> 45:12.690]  He sounds like a real Geoff.
[45:13.090 --> 45:13.330]  Yeah.
[45:13.830 --> 45:15.470]  Lee Offman is his name.
[45:16.030 --> 45:16.450]  Igor.
[45:16.830 --> 45:17.510]  I was close.
[45:17.510 --> 45:20.250]  Igor Patterson, Lee Offman.
[45:20.810 --> 45:23.130]  Almost the same amount of letters in the first name.
[45:23.350 --> 45:24.270]  Lee is a short name.
[45:24.610 --> 45:25.470]  Igor, only four.
[45:25.910 --> 45:27.310]  I feel like I was relatively close.
[45:27.710 --> 45:29.010]  I remember it was a short name.
[45:29.730 --> 45:30.170]  Igor.
[45:30.650 --> 45:31.030]  Igor.
[45:34.150 --> 45:36.390]  That's the same as being like, what was his name?
[45:37.570 --> 45:38.350]  Frankenstein, I think.
[45:38.530 --> 45:39.010]  Oh, Jim.
[45:39.290 --> 45:40.210]  Shit, I was close though.
[45:40.430 --> 45:43.410]  No, the letter count in those names are way off.
[45:43.490 --> 45:44.890]  I was only one letter off.
[45:45.410 --> 45:45.650]  One.
[45:45.650 --> 45:47.510]  Two syllables versus one though.
[45:47.790 --> 45:48.330]  Big deal.
[45:48.430 --> 45:48.750]  That's true.
[45:48.990 --> 45:49.710]  That's a good point.
[45:49.790 --> 45:53.410]  If I would have got the syllable count, that would have been an icing or a cherry.
[45:53.510 --> 45:54.030]  Not an icing.
[45:54.150 --> 45:55.570]  You always have icing on the cake.
[45:55.710 --> 45:58.070]  It's the cherry on the top of the sundae.
[45:58.330 --> 45:59.990]  Well, icing on the cake is also a phrase.
[46:00.210 --> 46:00.310]  Yeah.
[46:00.630 --> 46:04.370]  Yeah, but like, well, I guess there are icing-less cakes now, right?
[46:04.870 --> 46:05.990]  Aren't they called naked cakes?
[46:06.190 --> 46:07.430]  There always have been.
[46:07.690 --> 46:11.550]  Well, I mean, like, I feel like they're more popular than they used to be.
[46:11.610 --> 46:13.210]  This technology has moved on.
[46:13.830 --> 46:15.750]  Icing has retreated from the cakes.
[46:16.310 --> 46:16.770]  It has.
[46:16.950 --> 46:18.250]  Well, there's naked cakes now.
[46:18.410 --> 46:20.290]  And there's still icing on them, I guess.
[46:20.390 --> 46:21.270]  But it's like the side.
[46:21.650 --> 46:23.230]  Is there icing on a naked cake?
[46:24.490 --> 46:25.250]  I'm not crazy.
[46:25.350 --> 46:26.310]  You know what I'm talking about?
[46:26.330 --> 46:29.610]  Like, it's in the middle layers, but it's not on the sides.
[46:30.270 --> 46:31.050]  I've made one.
[46:31.450 --> 46:32.370]  I made one years ago.
[46:33.030 --> 46:34.890]  Yeah, well, like the top and in the middle.
[46:35.030 --> 46:36.310]  If you're doing a layered cake.
[46:36.670 --> 46:39.730]  Yeah, I just feel like if it's on the sides, it's definitely on the top as well.
[46:39.730 --> 46:43.370]  It's not like nobody makes a cake like Friar Tuck's head.
[46:50.330 --> 46:55.600]  I want a Friar Tuck cake!
[46:56.380 --> 46:59.060]  I would eat the shit out of that.
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.840]  I feel like the ratio of icing to sponge would be great.
[47:03.540 --> 47:05.380]  I'm not a big icing guy.
[47:05.780 --> 47:06.820]  I'm a big icing guy.
[47:06.940 --> 47:09.580]  I want, I'll tell you what, you can have the Friar Tuck.
[47:09.700 --> 47:12.480]  I'll just have the icing that you shave off the top of his head.
[47:13.860 --> 47:14.560]  What's the whole point?
[47:14.620 --> 47:15.500]  It comes without the neat.
[47:15.620 --> 47:17.080]  You'd have to just eat the back of his head.
[47:17.660 --> 47:17.940]  That's right.
[47:18.080 --> 47:18.620]  I'll eat the back of his head.
[47:19.440 --> 47:20.780]  I'll eat his face.
[47:20.940 --> 47:22.820]  I just want the back of Friar Tuck's head.
[47:22.920 --> 47:23.380]  That's all I want.
[47:23.640 --> 47:24.380]  You can have the face.
[47:25.680 --> 47:26.860]  Larry David cake.
[47:32.960 --> 47:33.680]  Oh shit.
[47:33.980 --> 47:34.440]  Oh my god.
[47:35.100 --> 47:36.100]  So Jack's still not shown up.
[47:36.160 --> 47:39.080]  Maybe he's doing his normal level of face attendance.
[47:39.440 --> 47:39.800]  Hustle.
[47:39.900 --> 47:40.100]  Yeah.
[47:40.520 --> 47:42.340]  It's a standard face hustle.
[47:42.340 --> 47:46.660]  Well, if this is the case, then I assume if it's going to go SOP with him,
[47:46.700 --> 47:50.700]  then I'll probably be getting hit up in a couple of seconds to leave this podcast
[47:50.700 --> 47:52.540]  to go work on annual pass for a few minutes.
[47:55.460 --> 47:56.740]  When's our next break shit?
[47:57.160 --> 47:58.800]  I was asking Eric that this morning.
[47:58.920 --> 48:01.760]  I would like to know because I would like to start planning for it.
[48:01.960 --> 48:03.540]  Early August is what I requested.
[48:04.320 --> 48:06.980]  So hopefully somewhere in there, but sometime in August for sure.
[48:07.220 --> 48:07.500]  All right.
[48:07.620 --> 48:09.980]  I don't know if it'll be when you're in town or not, Gavin,
[48:10.020 --> 48:12.240]  but I'll try to schedule it so that you're around.
[48:12.340 --> 48:15.380]  Well, maybe Andrew could be there in person and I'll be in the TV.
[48:15.920 --> 48:17.420]  Well, we can do that.
[48:17.780 --> 48:21.580]  Well, I mean, we need to give Andrew a couple of weeks notice to start the trip.
[48:22.160 --> 48:22.760]  It's true.
[48:23.220 --> 48:24.580]  It's not a fast trip for Andrew.
[48:27.040 --> 48:29.180]  Go now! Go, go, go, go now!
[48:29.960 --> 48:30.740]  Go! Go now!
[48:31.260 --> 48:32.580]  He just jumps onto a ferry.
[48:33.680 --> 48:35.260]  I'm trying to figure out what I want the...
[48:35.260 --> 48:38.560]  Like, I decided if I just wanted to say go, go now,
[48:38.700 --> 48:42.220]  or if it should say go, go now and then have a boat sticking half out of the water.
[48:42.940 --> 48:46.900]  Oh, I think it's definitely a boat half out of the water.
[48:47.160 --> 48:47.420]  Hello.
[48:47.920 --> 48:48.300]  Hello.
[48:48.760 --> 48:51.680]  Hey, minor league fan Jack, welcome to the podcast.
[48:52.360 --> 48:55.440]  Oh, thank you so much for having me. It's an honor to be here.
[48:55.740 --> 48:59.040]  It's nice to have you through Discord and not through Geoff's phone, through his mic.
[48:59.800 --> 49:01.460]  I swear to God, I was actually there.
[49:01.840 --> 49:04.160]  You couldn't hear me. I don't know what was going on, but I was there.
[49:04.440 --> 49:06.220]  Yeah, I heard it later in the recording.
[49:06.440 --> 49:07.420]  Jack, quick question for you.
[49:07.580 --> 49:07.940]  Shoot.
[49:08.280 --> 49:09.360]  What's Jurassic Park about?
[49:09.360 --> 49:14.580]  Jurassic Park is a movie about a scientist who creates dinosaurs and
[49:14.580 --> 49:18.040]  then a gentleman who turns them into a theme park based around those dinosaurs.
[49:18.620 --> 49:21.740]  Yep. Okay. But why does it... Why? Why does...
[49:21.740 --> 49:24.760]  What's the point of the movie? What's the plot of the movie? Like, why?
[49:25.140 --> 49:30.240]  I mean, I would argue the point of the movie is that don't mess with nature and nature finds a way.
[49:30.780 --> 49:35.860]  And yeah, and the plot of the movie is that everything looks good,
[49:35.980 --> 49:39.160]  but no, nature found a way and they replicated and then destroyed everything.
[49:39.360 --> 49:41.880]  But why does the movie happen when it happens?
[49:42.340 --> 49:43.960]  Can you rephrase that question, please?
[49:44.120 --> 49:46.280]  What's the inciting incident for things to go wrong?
[49:46.360 --> 49:48.180]  What causes the events of the movie?
[49:49.300 --> 49:52.540]  Nedry, the hacker, shuts down the power. And because of that,
[49:52.700 --> 49:56.080]  the walls go down and the dinosaurs get out and start eating people.
[49:56.400 --> 49:57.740]  Why is Alan Grant there?
[49:59.300 --> 50:04.160]  Alan Grant and Ellie Slater and, excuse me, Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm are there to
[50:04.160 --> 50:08.040]  basically give their thumbs up of approval on it because the lawyers were pissed off
[50:08.040 --> 50:12.860]  because people had died. And so Hammond needed someone to basically kind of give a thumbs up
[50:12.860 --> 50:15.220]  on the whole park to be like, oh, it's safe and it's great.
[50:15.400 --> 50:20.320]  And so he brought them in because he was funding their dig in Wyoming, I believe, or Montana.
[50:20.640 --> 50:24.140]  And so he's like, I know them and I can fund your dig for further if you come give me a thumbs up.
[50:24.200 --> 50:25.060]  And that's why they were there.
[50:25.400 --> 50:26.300]  Holy shit, Geoff.
[50:26.320 --> 50:28.660]  He knew more than you did, Gavin. Holy shit.
[50:28.880 --> 50:29.080]  Yep.
[50:29.440 --> 50:33.400]  And I feel like it's Gavin's fault for how he phrased it. He phrased it horribly,
[50:33.540 --> 50:34.820]  like six times in a row.
[50:34.820 --> 50:40.240]  I didn't want to give anything away in the information we were after.
[50:40.340 --> 50:42.120]  I was hoping that it would just eventually get there.
[50:42.220 --> 50:43.120]  I just wanted to be more specific.
[50:43.540 --> 50:46.960]  There's a line between not giving it away and actually asking what you're asking.
[50:47.100 --> 50:50.500]  You asked like six different questions that were unrelated to what you're pointing.
[50:50.500 --> 50:53.800]  I was just trying to get closer and closer to the reason the movie started.
[50:53.820 --> 50:54.080]  Oh, man.
[50:54.580 --> 50:59.360]  Say, Jack, Gavin watched Jurassic Park today and he discovered that the movie was about something
[50:59.360 --> 51:04.300]  he never realized. And he was explaining to us about the $20 million lawsuit over the guy that
[51:04.300 --> 51:10.260]  got sucked up by the raptors and how they brought Ian and the others on to basically certify that
[51:10.260 --> 51:13.600]  it was safe. And I said, if anybody on Earth knows that, it's you.
[51:13.960 --> 51:16.880]  I was just blown away, Jack, that I'd seen that movie about 15 times,
[51:16.940 --> 51:21.500]  but I never really knew that was the reason the movie event stopped.
[51:21.860 --> 51:24.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the whole point of it is Gennaro, the lawyer,
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.180]  is there and he's like, we got to get people to sign off on it. And yeah, there you go.
[51:29.600 --> 51:33.880]  I bet there are very few people on Earth who remember that the lawyer's name is Gennaro.
[51:34.600 --> 51:39.260]  You're in the top 0.01% of Jurassic Park fans, probably.
[51:39.740 --> 51:41.920]  Oh, thank you. I'm a Jurassic Park super fan, too, I guess.
[51:41.960 --> 51:45.300]  All right. OK. Robert Muldoon. What's his name? Muldoon.
[51:45.640 --> 51:48.260]  Robert Muldoon. Yeah, he's the warden, the game warden.
[51:48.580 --> 51:53.140]  Where did John Hammond find him? Oh, was it in like an African safari,
[51:53.260 --> 51:57.160]  I think, is where he found him? It was. It was from Hammond's Park in Kenya.
[51:57.720 --> 52:01.200]  Damn, he knows his shit. Jack, who wrote the Miami Dolphins fight song?
[52:03.640 --> 52:09.720]  The same guy who wrote the Country Road song. Oh, that's great. John Denver. He nailed it.
[52:10.220 --> 52:13.080]  If you would have known that, Jack, I would have laughed. You would have blown my mind.
[52:13.260 --> 52:16.480]  Nobody knows his name. I don't even know his name. I've read six stories about the guy.
[52:16.780 --> 52:18.820]  I can't remember his name. His name's Igor Patterson, right?
[52:19.600 --> 52:23.740]  I remember that. I don't even remember. We just said his name. I don't remember what it is.
[52:24.080 --> 52:27.280]  I just remember Igor. All right, Jack, thanks for proving
[52:27.280 --> 52:30.360]  Geoff right. And thanks for blowing my mind. All right. Yeah, I appreciate it, Jack.
[52:30.820 --> 52:33.080]  Big fan of the show, you guys. Love you guys. Thanks, Jack.
[52:33.540 --> 52:37.600]  There you go. That was a minor league fan, Jack. He didn't leave.
[52:37.840 --> 52:43.920]  No, he's still. He's here. He's hanging out. Did he leave on his end? Did he just close the app?
[52:44.020 --> 52:48.720]  Because he was on his phone. I think he just closed the app. He just walked away from his phone.
[52:50.580 --> 52:52.560]  He's still there. Maybe he just wanted to listen.
[52:52.560 --> 52:54.000]  I wonder if you guys need me to leave now.
[53:00.440 --> 53:03.760]  I wonder if whenever he's done talking on the phone, he's like, all right, mom,
[53:03.840 --> 53:08.140]  I'll see you later. And he just puts his phone down fully on and just goes to another room.
[53:10.600 --> 53:15.480]  Jack really knows his shit with that movie. Yeah, he does. Hey, Henry found the squeaky toy
[53:15.480 --> 53:18.680]  again. That's cool. I forgot about Henry. The squeaky toy,
[53:18.780 --> 53:23.300]  Geoff, you were trying to shush it. But in your ocean rescue story, it was really it added a lot
[53:23.300 --> 53:29.480]  to it. It was fantastic. It was so funny. It was just distracting me. I was trying so hard
[53:29.480 --> 53:34.680]  not to forget the different elements of the story. Nick says that was the cherry on top.
[53:35.520 --> 53:47.090]  Oh, man, by the way, my girlfriend the other night, she gave me she asked me about something
[53:47.550 --> 53:52.950]  and she gave me the look. And it was she didn't have to she didn't say anything. But with her eyes,
[53:52.950 --> 53:59.230]  I very clearly got the message to get these fucking bats out of our house.
[54:00.370 --> 54:04.850]  Okay, so I got to do something about these goddamn bats. I asked yesterday or the other day
[54:04.850 --> 54:10.270]  more tags because we we determined last time we recorded that we have elements of a lot of ideas,
[54:10.410 --> 54:15.750]  but not enough to do any one of them. So hopefully those will come in soon. And then Gavin will come
[54:15.750 --> 54:21.490]  over and cut 100 bats while I watch. So just to recap, you have 100 bats and 900 knobs.
[54:22.330 --> 54:31.110]  Correct. And 1000 metal tags. I like I just still love that someone just bought everything in our
[54:31.110 --> 54:34.710]  discussion didn't like more about what we'd settled on. It's like, well, they talked about
[54:34.710 --> 54:38.990]  this. They talked about this. They suggested this. I'll just buy all of that. Now I've got everything
[54:38.990 --> 54:44.430]  in their defense. I mean, I've been so confused for so long. I don't know that I gave any kind
[54:44.430 --> 54:49.010]  of correct instructions on what we wanted because I don't remember. I'm so fucking far
[54:49.010 --> 54:52.990]  gone with these bats, man. I just want them out of my life. They haven't even started yet.
[54:53.250 --> 54:57.790]  I like that they fucked with you more by doing what was said than Gavin and I ever did by
[54:57.790 --> 55:03.570]  implying the bats were manipulated some way. They've caused way more. Yeah, just annoyance.
[55:03.830 --> 55:07.370]  Yeah, this is why. Yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
[55:08.190 --> 55:13.170]  They've become a permanent shelf in my library for me to store stuff on.
[55:13.450 --> 55:16.650]  This is we're probably not going to record for a bit at this point. I mean,
[55:16.650 --> 55:20.250]  the break shit thing will happen, but we're probably at least two weeks. I'd assume I'm
[55:20.250 --> 55:23.950]  going to miss you guys. I'm going to miss you, too. Yeah, I think we just need to stay in touch.
[55:25.070 --> 55:29.150]  There'll be a lot of excitement for when we come back. It's multiple layers of like,
[55:29.270 --> 55:34.330]  we need to stay in touch because I love you guys, but also just to make sure Geoff is still alive.
[55:35.790 --> 55:41.150]  Yeah, I feel like it goes back and forth between Andrew and Geoff on like who's more in danger,
[55:41.150 --> 55:45.370]  because sometimes there have been times where Andrew is just like dropping pints of blood out
[55:45.370 --> 55:48.890]  his ass and I'm actually worried that he's going to die. And now at the moment, it's just gone
[55:48.890 --> 55:53.690]  Geoff's way. So it's very different because I feel like Geoff's danger comes when he's going to look
[55:53.690 --> 56:00.150]  at sharks. Mine is I ordered pancake mix and then just everything fell apart. It's the mundane that
[56:00.150 --> 56:06.450]  gets me. I look I just got my tetanus shot, so I'm feeling pretty safe right now. You're going
[56:06.450 --> 56:12.370]  to be climbing over so many fences, not worried about it. Andrew, I think we need to start
[56:12.370 --> 56:16.870]  booking in the dates for when you're going to try the marathon, though. I feel like it's never good
[56:16.870 --> 56:22.890]  when a bit is discussed and never happens, but we should try and make it happen. I completely
[56:22.890 --> 56:27.470]  agree. This is the redemption year. It's going to happen. Yeah, I've been very vocal on this.
[56:27.570 --> 56:32.350]  When did the redemption year start? Is that just the beginning of the year? No, it started when
[56:32.350 --> 56:37.930]  this podcast turned two years old, whenever that was. So episode what, 50, 53, 54? Well,
[56:37.930 --> 56:43.990]  when did I declare? Well, yeah, we're going into our second year now. Yeah. Yeah, we're the first
[56:44.550 --> 56:49.310]  year. Yeah, we're going into the second year. Year two. Year two is like Redemption Island.
[56:49.710 --> 56:56.130]  It is. Yeah, sure. Why not? Okay, man. I just started season 35 of Survivor and talk about the
[56:56.130 --> 57:06.790]  dumbest premise yet. It is heroes versus healers versus hustlers. It's a great season. It's a good
[57:06.790 --> 57:17.710]  season so far, but what a dumb concept. Heroes versus healers versus hustlers. What? They do
[57:17.710 --> 57:22.970]  run out of premises pretty quickly. Goddamn. They eventually just start calling it island names,
[57:23.150 --> 57:27.010]  like like Gavin said, Redemption Island, like they move away from like the group premises
[57:27.010 --> 57:31.950]  that are just like, this is an island about redemption. We're going to call this island
[57:31.950 --> 57:39.550]  Ghost Island. Or what is it like when they when they like when they ban them to the island by
[57:39.550 --> 57:44.810]  themselves? Exile Island. Exile Island. Yeah, you got exile there later. There's a later season
[57:44.810 --> 57:51.610]  called Island of the Idols. And so come on, people are like, oh, shit. Are there like a million idols
[57:51.610 --> 57:55.410]  on this island? They go one at a time, like somebody has to go to the island of the idols.
[57:55.930 --> 58:00.970]  It's not it's not idols. They just got Boston Rob and Sandra hanging out on a different beach.
[58:00.970 --> 58:05.990]  And they're like, how's it going in your game? And then they give them tips and they offer them
[58:05.990 --> 58:11.450]  challenges. No, they're not playing. They just coexist on a different island. Quest givers.
[58:11.710 --> 58:17.890]  Yeah, they did that last year. Like Cochran was hanging out on a boat giving advice. Yeah,
[58:17.910 --> 58:22.030]  that was that's a random reward where Cochran shows up and is like, what's in it for them,
[58:22.170 --> 58:25.810]  though? Like those people like Boston. Money. Good. Because he's trying to win money.
[58:25.930 --> 58:29.810]  Oh, for the players. So, OK, this is how it works. It is great.
[58:29.810 --> 58:34.790]  So you get there, right? And Rob will be like, there's one. The first one I remember. Boston Rob
[58:34.790 --> 58:38.670]  is like, I'm really good at making fire. Do you know how to make fire? I'm going to teach you
[58:38.670 --> 58:43.790]  how to make fire. And then so they go through the process of teaching the person and then they'll
[58:43.790 --> 58:49.410]  offer them a challenge. So Boston Rob was like, I'll give you, I don't know, a second vote at
[58:49.410 --> 58:55.110]  a tribal council if you can make fire faster than me. But if you can't, then you lose your vote at
[58:55.110 --> 58:59.430]  the next tribal. And then they're like going back and forth. And Rob is like, you know,
[58:59.430 --> 59:03.570]  it's a big move having two votes. It could be a real game changer. Got to evaluate your thing.
[59:03.650 --> 59:08.730]  He eventually convinces the person to do it. They lose miserably. And then it just goes to
[59:08.730 --> 59:12.790]  a confessional of him going like, they're the dumbest person alive. Why would they challenge
[59:12.790 --> 59:17.010]  me? They didn't know how to make fire. I taught them. How would they ever beat me at this?
[59:17.310 --> 59:22.710]  It's a really dumb premise. They have them hiding Gavin in a little spy shack at tribal council.
[59:22.910 --> 59:26.950]  They sit above it and do commentary of what's happening. Terrible season.
[59:26.950 --> 59:30.990]  Matt, after Geoff called you Russell Hance, I went on a bit of a Russell Hance
[59:31.550 --> 59:34.770]  tour through the season. One of the most insulting things that he was ever said.
[59:35.350 --> 59:40.550]  Boy, is that an insult. And also, boy, does that guy's game not work if anyone is seen in play.
[59:40.830 --> 59:48.370]  Jesus. It's thrilling. He was so lucky doing back to backs. He was. He went on Survivor Australia.
[59:48.570 --> 59:53.370]  First one voted out. Did not last long. That's true. Just immediately gone. Something I was
[59:53.370 --> 59:56.730]  looking at there is like, I guess they do like two at a time sometimes on Survivor. Yeah.
[59:56.730 --> 01:00:02.870]  Does that mean that Russell was sat there in the final? Well, this is a spoiler for Survivor. It is.
[01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:08.950]  Russell was sat there in the final of Survivor, knowing that he'd already gone out again and got
[01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:14.730]  to the final of the other one, but had to do that entire season talking about his previous season,
[01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:19.010]  not knowing whether he'd won it or not. Yeah. You blew my mind because I knew this going in,
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:23.650]  that the whole thing they talk about constantly in Heroes vs. Villains, which is a second season,
[01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:27.610]  that none of them had the chance to see him play, and he was kind of this unknown variable,
[01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:33.410]  which is largely why I think he has success in that game. It never occurred to me that he would
[01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:38.170]  have done both, been in the finale for both, expecting to win two million dollars, like you
[01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:44.450]  pointed out, and win zero. He didn't make a dime from playing Survivor. That was the one where he
[01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:51.450]  cried. Oh, yeah, that's Redemption Island. And then we got stuck with his nephew for two seasons.
[01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:56.130]  Oh, I haven't got to that yet. You guys are watching this show like you're popping in and
[01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:02.510]  out season to season. I've watched it live every season since it came out. I had to deal with the
[01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:09.170]  Hance family for like five years. Yeah. Five consecutive years of Hance. It's a long clip.
[01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:14.810]  It's a long, they really, they try to get the most out of the Hance family. Yeah, we probably
[01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.490]  shouldn't talk about Survivor too much on this because there's so many people haven't seen it,
[01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:24.230]  but I would love like an offline Survivor conversation at one point. I'm so into it.
[01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:29.550]  I want to do like a Survivor fan podcast, kind of like Rosebuddies for Bachelor. I've been been
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:32.830]  trying to promote that or trying to throw that idea towards Trevor for a while. I don't know
[01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.930]  if we'll ever get to do that. I don't know if there'd be any audience for it. But if you're a
[01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:40.770]  comment leaver and you want to listen to us talk about Survivor, let us know. Maybe we'll make a
[01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:44.870]  Survivor podcast. Andrew would have to be in it because he's like the world's Survivor authority.
[01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:50.310]  It's bizarre to me because I'm one of the things, the pandemic, people started watching Survivor for
[01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:55.110]  some reason, maybe because it was added to Netflix was an entry point. But I've lived most of my
[01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:59.350]  life not being able to talk to anybody about Survivor and just watching it constantly.
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:03.890]  It's maybe my favorite show. I love Survivor. It's a staple of my life as far as entertainment
[01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:08.630]  goes. Dude, it's all I've watched for the last 15 seasons, like the last six weeks.
[01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:12.030]  That and Housewives, you know, the real Housewives of Beverly Hills, obviously.
[01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:16.990]  The other thing Gavin did that blew my mind is he had watched like five or six seasons.
[01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.790]  He somehow hadn't seen Boston Rob play Geoff. Are you serious?
[01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:26.090]  Yeah. He's like, what season is Boston Rob on? And I'm like, season five, season nine,
[01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:33.490]  season 20, season 22. Like he's in six or seven seasons. It's amazing that you avoided somehow
[01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:38.110]  a Boston Rob season. That'd be hard to do. What am I on now? I'm on one where...
[01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:43.390]  Oh, it's... Dude, he so half-assed my birthday cameo. It was great.
[01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:49.870]  Yeah. Do you still have it? It was so good. Yeah, I think so. I have him and Coach.
[01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:54.910]  Coach's was like an hour. That checks out. Can you get probes?
[01:02:55.350 --> 01:03:02.010]  I would recommend, in a not serious way, Boston Rob wrote one of the worst self-help books I've
[01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:06.810]  ever read. I haven't read many, but it's an atrocious book. Is it bad advice?
[01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:13.410]  It's not bad advice. Every chapter is about three pages long. And then he does a summary at the end
[01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:18.270]  of every chapter where it's like three statements that cover all of it. And it's the same structure
[01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:24.050]  of like real statement, joke statement, heartfelt statement for everything. And it's just,
[01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:30.370]  it's unnecessary. It's called the Boston Rob Rulebook. It's available anywhere online. Like
[01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:32.830]  you could get it, you could Apple store, whatever. You could buy it digitally.
[01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.450]  I think he'll be a great guest for this if we ever did it.
[01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:41.270]  Oh, I'd love it. He's a fascinating guy. For sure. It's interesting. It's also interesting
[01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:46.290]  how personally people take that game. There are people from his seasons that have not forgiven
[01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:56.690]  him for how he played. This is, so I was told me that like, if you win something,
[01:03:56.870 --> 01:04:01.630]  you just shouldn't do it again. Like there's, what's this guy's name? JT or something.
[01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:09.410]  Who apparently won once, but I've only seen him just completely not understand how to use idols.
[01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:13.250]  Like he gave one to Russell and then he went home with another one. It's like,
[01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:16.230]  this guy should never have come back. I can't believe he won.
[01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:21.650]  Sandra won twice, right? She did, but she like plays a game where like she gets there by the
[01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:25.790]  end because nobody views her as a threat. She's like a quiet Phillip. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:31.490]  Her strategy. It's the most, so JT has a phenomenal seasons. I'd recommend watching
[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:37.130]  token teams. Whatever. I think that's like season probably 18 would be my guess.
[01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:43.110]  He becomes most iconic for later. And my, my favorite later JT moment and of all the seasons,
[01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:48.850]  he gets into a fight with somebody over sugar. They won like a coffee set at a reward and he's
[01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:53.470]  like, she keeps eating all the fucking sugar. I'm sick of this person and their sugar consumption.
[01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:58.650]  It was Mikaela, I think. Yeah. Mikaela was clearly like joking around when she was like,
[01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:05.890]  oh, seven drops of coffee at a spoonful of sugar. JT is furious. So then Sandra just ate all of the
[01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:10.810]  sugar in the dish. And then did like the gym from the office face, knowing that JT would see it and
[01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:16.510]  be like, Mikaela ate the fucking sugar. It's such a good moment. Totally, totally worked too.
[01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:23.070]  It's like a perfect pull focus to Sandra who just nails the lens. It's like quite unlike
[01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:26.610]  most shots in Survivor, but they clearly left it in because it was like the cameraman must have
[01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:32.630]  been like, oh my God, that was perfect. Yeah. Oh my God. What do you think the best season of
[01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:37.730]  Survivor is? That's such a, okay. That's a long question. We should wrap up, I guess. It really
[01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:41.210]  depends on what you're looking for. So like there's sort of an arc. I recommend that you
[01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:45.910]  started at the beginning of the Russell season. Cause that Russell, whether you like him or not
[01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:50.910]  changed the game dramatically. I loved him. Highly entertaining to watch. Wasn't in game
[01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:56.930]  changes though. Uh, no, but like the, I argue that 80% of that cast wasn't a game changer.
[01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:02.150]  It's a terrible, it's a really weird cast. That was a good season though. No spoilers. I'm still
[01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:07.670]  on that one. Okay. I just finished it two days ago. Okay. Game changer. Well, that is a, who's
[01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:15.530]  like a Zeke on that season and Andrea. Zeke is on it. Andrea. Aubrey's on it. Uh, game change is
[01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:24.610]  like Haley. Uh, Ty is on it. Sierra is on it. Oh, both Sierras. Have you seen beauty, brains
[01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:31.350]  and brawn? Yeah. That's a great, the, the thing with Scott Pollard and Ty. What a vote. Oh, with
[01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:35.490]  the super idol. Yeah. The super idol where he's like, you're going to give it to me. And Ty's
[01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:43.050]  just like, nah, Scott's like, really? And he's like, yup. Oh my God. So Gavin, you said you're,
[01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:47.390]  you're on that season right now. So you, have you seen where Saree, have you seen the, the,
[01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:50.890]  the vote with Saree where she tries to use the idol or stresses the advantage?
[01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:56.390]  Seems like a spoiler. Yeah. Well, I won't, I won't, not really. I just won't spoil it for you,
[01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:01.190]  but it's a iconic moment in survivor. We should wrap this up. Yeah. We should wrap this up and
[01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:07.010]  then, uh, probably pitch some sort of survivor podcast so we can just make that. Yeah. All right.
[01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:11.970]  Well, uh, well, this is us stopping. Sorry. If you don't watch survivor, that was probably
[01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:18.910]  insanely boring last 10 minutes. Yeah. Uh, you should try it. If you haven't tried it,
[01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:24.190]  it's on Netflix. If you're in the U S it's on Amazon. I only started watching it cause y'all
[01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:28.070]  talked about it. And then I was bored. I don't know. How do you watch it outside of the U S?
[01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:34.110]  That's a great question. It's on, I watch it. I watch it across Netflix, Hulu, and Paramount plus.
[01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:37.530]  So if any of those are available outside of the U S yeah. But all of those have like different
[01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:42.410]  libraries. Sure. Sure. I don't know what like yeah. Paramount plus is available in Canada.
[01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:46.890]  Paramount plus has all the seasons. It's the only service that has everything that I'm aware of.
[01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:52.830]  That's a real piece of shit though. I'm not a huge fan. Yeah. So far. I can't wait to get you
[01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:59.310]  guys into the challenge after survivor that that's going to be. I'm ready to go buddy. I got
[01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:03.650]  like a five more seasons of survivor. That should take me another two weeks. And then I'm it's sad.
[01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:08.550]  I've realized there's not enough time left in my life to watch all of the television that I want
[01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:13.910]  to. Yeah. Yeah. There's too much reality TV that's been made and I don't have enough time left on
[01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:20.050]  earth to get through it. I think I'm, I think I'm not for the first time since they came out,
[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:23.410]  I think I'm going to skip this season's love Island. I just haven't had,
[01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:27.530]  I haven't had the time to jump into it and I'm getting way far behind. So I think I'm just,
[01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:30.230]  I might be off the love Island train because there's just no time.
[01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:35.570]  Great time to start the challenge. I think it starts next week. New season. Well, I have to
[01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:40.470]  watch 25 seasons to catch up. That is true because unlike survivor, the challenge uses the same cast
[01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:47.130]  every season. So it's great. This dumb, dumb, trashy people try to be political. And I have
[01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:51.110]  not seen that show, but I have seen X on the beach and I'm sure, I think a lot of them are from that
[01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:55.990]  show. So it'll be interesting. Yeah. All right. Well, uh, we still seem to be talking, uh,
[01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:01.850]  we all agreed to stop a while ago. Uh, Nick is now, is now posting the discord as Eric.
[01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:07.170]  Thanks for listening. Like, and subscribe. See you next time.

[01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:16.030]  That's my hair.
