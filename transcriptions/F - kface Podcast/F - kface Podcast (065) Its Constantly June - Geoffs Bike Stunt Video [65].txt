[00:18.380 --> 00:40.160]  slash face 14. This is hello and welcome to episode 65 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:40.820 --> 00:45.960]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free in no particular
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.300]  order. Although I realize saying it out loud, I usually say Gavin before Andrew. And I wonder
[00:50.300 --> 00:54.520]  why I do that. It's not intentional, but it definitely happens more often than not.
[00:54.660 --> 00:58.840]  This is kind of a special... Gavin and I were talking about this yesterday. It's a special
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.620]  episode. We're not supposed to be filming this right now. This is a sort of a gift from the
[01:03.620 --> 01:09.760]  podcast gods that we are doing this in this moment. The last time we all spoke together...
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.980]  You're not talking. The last time we all spoke together... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
[01:13.980 --> 01:17.960]  you. I was just gonna say the last time we all spoke together, we talked about how it might be
[01:17.960 --> 01:23.300]  the last time we ever speak together if anybody died. Nobody did! No, that's what I was gonna
[01:23.300 --> 01:26.840]  say. I thought you're saying that it's a special episode because we weren't expecting to do it.
[01:27.120 --> 01:31.580]  I think it's special that we all lived after you cursed us. Well, I didn't curse us. I just
[01:31.580 --> 01:38.840]  just pointed out. So far. Yeah, that's true. Gavin might be... We should get into it. It's
[01:38.840 --> 01:43.420]  gonna be a fun podcast for a couple reasons, I think. We tried to make the most of this extra
[01:43.420 --> 01:49.040]  time together, which if Gavin lives long enough to tell the story, we can get into that. But Gavin,
[01:49.220 --> 01:54.720]  you're dying. I might have poisoned myself. I'm not sure yet. I feel a bit dizzy and my throat
[01:54.720 --> 02:05.960]  feels small. I decided I'd tackle the wasp nest right before this. I don't know if we updated
[02:05.960 --> 02:12.040]  the F*** Face listeners, but the nest was partially destroyed when I turned on the fan and then they
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.660]  just decided we'll just make it on the outside of the fan. So they're now on the bit that doesn't
[02:17.660 --> 02:22.300]  spin where the fan connects to the ceiling. A big old nest. Haven't been out there a while.
[02:22.780 --> 02:29.480]  I thought I'll buy some killer. So I bought a little can of wasp foam. I'm not sure how it
[02:29.480 --> 02:35.880]  the wasps. I assume it's an extremely powerful poison because I sprayed it. I sprayed it on the
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.480]  nest and they just dropped dead within like five seconds. And I was like, bloody hell. And I was
[02:42.480 --> 02:46.600]  reading the instructions. It was like spray from, you know, upwind, you don't want it blowing on
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.280]  you. And then immediately get out of there. And I was, I stepped back and I just watched all these
[02:51.280 --> 02:55.760]  wasps just drop down dead. I was like, bloody hell, what is this stuff? What's it doing to him?
[02:55.760 --> 03:02.380]  And, um, I just backed the hell up, but then I started to feel the wind against my face and I
[03:02.380 --> 03:09.500]  was like, well, should I be, I need to get out. I need to cross directly under the, under the nest
[03:09.500 --> 03:14.720]  to get out of it. So I just like pulled my t-shirt up. I just powered through. And ever since then
[03:14.720 --> 03:21.420]  I've been feeling a little bit dizzy, a little bit shaky and my throat feels small. So I've just
[03:21.420 --> 03:27.160]  told them, I've told my co-host here just to check in on me. If I go quiet for too long, just
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.540]  make sure I'm still there because I don't know what might happen. And I'm sure I'm just feeling
[03:32.540 --> 03:38.040]  a little bit paranoid because I felt wind on my face and must've immediately thought I've inhaled
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.300]  this stuff. So it might be my own body playing tricks on me, but who knows? Hopefully I'm,
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.540]  hopefully I'm fine. I'll be honest with you, dude. Uh, it doesn't sound good. It doesn't
[03:47.540 --> 03:52.200]  sound good. I have two immediate thoughts. One, I love that in the instructions that you read them,
[03:52.240 --> 03:55.180]  you took the time to read them. You were being safe. Read all of them. Read the whole can.
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.160]  Their instructions were to like wear protective gear, make sure you have a mask on. Their,
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.100]  their instructions were use it and book it because it will be problems if you stay.
[04:04.420 --> 04:08.240]  Yeah. Well, there was a lot of other stuff. It was like, don't, don't use on a day where it's,
[04:08.300 --> 04:11.680]  when it's going to rain. Sure. That was another one. Cause I don't want it to like wash into the
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.760]  water systems, I guess. But I just, I feel like it's such an obvious, you should probably be
[04:15.760 --> 04:20.440]  wearing a mask to do this. And it seems as though their tone was just run really fast.
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.840]  Nick's, Nick's right. It did say use at dusk and I didn't, I didn't pay attention to that.
[04:26.780 --> 04:30.700]  Okay. I now take back everything I said. You opened this by seeming like you were following
[04:30.700 --> 04:35.900]  all instructions as given and you clearly just skimmed it. He read them. He didn't heed them.
[04:36.080 --> 04:39.180]  That's different. The dusk stuff is just that there's going to be less wasps there during the
[04:39.180 --> 04:43.760]  day. They're going to be, they're not going to be all back. Oh, you think that's a wasp warning?
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.400]  They don't want you to attack the full crew at once. They're going for your safety in case
[04:47.400 --> 04:50.700]  there's no, they want you to get the full crew. They want you to use it on them when they're
[04:50.700 --> 04:54.540]  least active and when most of them are back. But I just thought I'll just quickly get this done.
[04:54.600 --> 04:59.020]  Cause, cause basically I want to be, uh, I need to work in that area. I need to do some
[04:59.020 --> 05:05.040]  other drilling and you want to get them at the end of the day after they've done their full eight
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.520]  hour wasp duties and they're exhausted and they're sitting around their wasp dinner tables,
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.320]  just trying to eat a little bit of food and listen to their shitty wasp family.
[05:13.320 --> 05:18.300]  And they're just exhausted and just kind of emotionally drained. And then that's when you
[05:18.300 --> 05:21.900]  hit them with the poison. I feel like you're setting up a real lone survivor scenario,
[05:21.900 --> 05:26.940]  which I'd be very fearful of. There's going to be one wasp who comes home and sees what has
[05:26.940 --> 05:31.560]  happened and will be vengeful. I was just going to say the other thing that brings me a lot of joy
[05:31.560 --> 05:35.620]  is the fact that you're living the happening too. You're the only person outside of the happening
[05:35.620 --> 05:40.640]  that is run from the wind, that is terrified of the breeze. That when you felt that breeze,
[05:40.640 --> 05:45.020]  it was like, this is death. I got to go. I swear that was like an immediate windshake.
[05:45.340 --> 05:49.380]  I would have honestly just left it because, I mean, they don't really, they're not very aggressive,
[05:49.800 --> 05:53.540]  but I have seen my cat sort of jump at him and try and chase him. And I thought
[05:53.540 --> 05:58.180]  that Smee's going to get stung on his face if he leaves the valley. So I might as well just
[05:58.180 --> 06:06.080]  shift this one nest. When the wind started to attack you, did you go, what? No! Like Mark
[06:06.080 --> 06:18.000]  Wahlberg? Slowed down to like 5% or 50%. What? No! Well, I don't want you to be the only one
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.280]  poisoned, Gavin. I had, you reminded me of something. You gonna drink some bleach to
[06:22.280 --> 06:28.980]  misery this company? No! So I was going through my closet and I've been trying to find a certain
[06:28.980 --> 06:33.640]  cable. I wanted to reset up my Xbox 360. So I've just been going through everything I have.
[06:34.080 --> 06:38.100]  And I found a garbage bag. And I was like, what is this? I don't remember what this is.
[06:38.460 --> 06:42.920]  I still have my fire extinguisher in my garbage bag from when I fired it with all the stuff.
[06:43.060 --> 06:48.160]  I haven't opened it yet. I've been meaning to take it apart. Why not just throw it all away?
[06:48.700 --> 06:51.620]  Well, because I kind of want to see what it looks like on the inside.
[06:52.480 --> 06:56.600]  You should try and like buy a load of vials and you can sell it. To who?
[06:58.420 --> 07:03.820]  To where? Like what? What do you mean? Not the RISD store? Vials of fire extinguisher?
[07:04.020 --> 07:08.520]  Gavin, I'm having a hard time moving these sauces. I don't think the fire extinguisher
[07:09.340 --> 07:12.960]  remnants. Well, you got to start getting your, I was listening to the, which I never do,
[07:13.060 --> 07:16.480]  but I was listening to the most recent episode and you got to start getting your sauces graded.
[07:16.780 --> 07:19.800]  You talked about it. I do, you're right. They're worth like three times as much. If you get a,
[07:19.860 --> 07:25.040]  you get a PSA 10 BPS sauce, that's, you don't need to sell a lot of those to retire.
[07:25.040 --> 07:30.480]  Did you see that they have a new celebrity meal coming out August 8th? No. I don't remember who
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.440]  it is, but there's a new one coming out with a different sauces. It's clearly working. Yeah.
[07:35.820 --> 07:41.280]  Well, I, I'm a big fan of it because fucking, okay, this is, I have a complaint with McDonald's.
[07:42.060 --> 07:48.460]  That looks like a great weedy. Yes. It's a big Mac and like a four piece nuggets, whatever. Anyway,
[07:48.620 --> 07:53.720]  they were supposed to stop selling. I think maybe this is a great argument for what I was saying
[07:53.720 --> 07:58.240]  before. They were supposed to stop selling the BTS sauce on June 20th. And they're still
[07:58.240 --> 08:01.980]  selling it to this day. I ordered McDonald's yesterday and I got two more sauce tanks.
[08:02.600 --> 08:07.220]  So I need this new one to come in and push out all the BTS sauce. Cause it's still in circulation.
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.780]  I need there to be a demand. There's still no demand. There's still no demand. And it's over
[08:11.780 --> 08:17.040]  a month later. I think they forgot because June is a very forgettable month. I just don't,
[08:17.080 --> 08:20.500]  I just don't agree with that. There's nothing forgettable about the month of June. That's for
[08:20.500 --> 08:25.960]  sure. There's a song name, name a song about June. What is the June song? Happy birthday.
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.160]  Happy birthday. That doesn't count. That's not about June. My birthday's in June. I hear it.
[08:32.180 --> 08:37.620]  It counts. It's not about June. It's about my birthday, which is in June. Yeah, I know,
[08:37.660 --> 08:44.560]  but that's not the same. I'm talking about a song about the month of June. Hey, hey, June.
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.280]  You're right. I apologize. It's an iconic hit. Everyone loves Hey, June. Here's a bunch of
[08:52.280 --> 08:58.100]  songs about June by bands I've not heard. Yeah, there's a whole list. You've heard of my September
[08:58.100 --> 09:03.700]  song. Nine songs about the month of June from Train to the Decembrist to Eminem.
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.560]  June Hymn by the Decembrists. Drops of Jupiter by Train, gross. June is Busting Out All Over
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.400]  by Carousel. That sounds gross. Words I Couldn't Say by Rascal Flatts. Oh, wait. June in
[09:14.400 --> 09:23.780]  January by none other than Dean Martin. Did It Again by Shakira and Her June Don't Lie. Eminem
[09:23.780 --> 09:29.060]  sings a song called Spacebound all about the month of June, June, as does Nicki Minaj with Dead Wrong.
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.160]  Damn, dude, that's some heavy hitters. I feel like a lot of those are about people named June,
[09:33.220 --> 09:36.660]  though, and not the month. We could do a June mixtape. There's so much.
[09:38.820 --> 09:43.120]  Not nearly as iconic. You get a lot of people named June, but not a lot of people called September.
[09:43.120 --> 09:50.000]  That's true. That's a great point. I have a question for you guys. What do we want to talk?
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.680]  Do we want to talk? The Olympics are on. We can talk about the Olympics. Or we could talk about
[09:55.680 --> 09:59.840]  one of the things I've been most excited about for weeks now. That finally happened.
[10:00.800 --> 10:07.000]  That I've been avoiding all info on. And I really hope... I don't see how I could be disappointed,
[10:07.880 --> 10:11.820]  but I'm scared that I will be. What are you talking about, Andrew?
[10:11.820 --> 10:15.600]  Yeah, I don't know what you mean. That's very weird. I was so excited
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.160]  going into this. I suddenly just got the feeling that I'm about to be very disappointed.
[10:19.840 --> 10:27.180]  The bike trick apparently happened. We were lucky enough. So the reason we're filming this week,
[10:27.240 --> 10:33.520]  we weren't gonna... I was gonna go abroad, but then about 12 hours before going to the airport,
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.460]  I decided I wasn't. So we actually were able to film the bike trick. The bike trick. Not only did
[10:40.460 --> 10:44.440]  we film it, I'd also like to point out another nice thing about today's recording is that the
[10:44.440 --> 10:51.020]  last three recordings we've done have been doubled up. So we've done double episodes, which is great
[10:51.020 --> 10:56.820]  and it was a necessity because of this upcoming trip. But kind of nice to know that we only got
[10:56.820 --> 11:03.180]  to do one today, you know? Yeah. We can just like easy peasy, just one episode. Yeah. But we took
[11:03.180 --> 11:10.540]  advantage of that time. And because Gavin and I made the plans so last minute, we tricked mother
[11:10.540 --> 11:17.340]  nature. She wasn't able to shit on us. And she did a different way. I'll say that. Gavin and I
[11:17.340 --> 11:24.800]  picked what must have been the hottest day on earth to sit in a concrete ditch for three hours
[11:24.800 --> 11:32.880]  and watch a progress bar on his camera. It was so hot, dude. The camera was burning my hands.
[11:32.880 --> 11:40.940]  It was hot to hold. It's black metal. I am being, I'm not, this isn't hyperbole and I'm not
[11:40.940 --> 11:46.960]  exaggerating when I say that I had to do the trick or attempt the trick many times throughout the
[11:46.960 --> 11:53.720]  course of the recording to get coverage. I would say about halfway in, I was afraid I was going to
[11:53.720 --> 11:59.360]  pass out on the bike. I was afraid I was going to pass out just trying to hold the camera.
[12:00.500 --> 12:04.680]  I was trying to bring minimal stuff. So I didn't bring, I didn't bring a tripod. I was just like
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.240]  hanging a camera out of my hand with a lens. But it's still quite heavy.
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.580]  We walked from Gavin's house because we couldn't figure out how to ride two bikes with this
[12:12.580 --> 12:17.960]  $700,000 camera. So we, I walked my bike and Gavin just walked with a backpack from his house
[12:17.960 --> 12:24.460]  a very long way to this ditch, first of all. And so we were exhausted before we got there.
[12:25.020 --> 12:30.980]  And, uh, holy shit, man. It was, there was no shade. It was just concrete on top of concrete
[12:30.980 --> 12:36.580]  on top of blazing hot ass Texas sun. So I want to set the scene a little bit,
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.940]  because I still, you've described this trick several times. I still have no idea what it
[12:40.940 --> 12:44.660]  looks like. I don't actually know what you're doing. Let me be honest with you, Andrew.
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.820]  I got there and Geoff, Geoff was like, cause I needed to know where to stand to film it.
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.700]  Yeah. Geoff ran me through the trick. He was like, okay, come on, come up here. I'm going to
[12:53.700 --> 12:58.540]  go over this and I'm going to slide down here. He explained it to me like in real time. I still
[12:58.540 --> 13:02.340]  didn't know what he was going to do. I had to just be like, oh, you just got to do it. Cause I don't
[13:02.340 --> 13:07.060]  know what this motherfucker, he goes, I explained the trick to him. I go to this, this, this. And
[13:07.060 --> 13:11.140]  he goes, oh, so where do I stand? And I go, I, you're the fucking cameraman. I don't know
[13:11.140 --> 13:15.360]  wherever you stand. I'm not going to do your job for you. I'm going to do the fucking trick.
[13:16.120 --> 13:19.880]  See where you were going to go for the sake of my lens and stuff.
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So here's the deal. I've been trying to think about how to tackle
[13:25.640 --> 13:30.560]  explaining this, this, what, what, what, what went down. And I think it's better through Gavin.
[13:30.740 --> 13:35.240]  I think Gavin, you should take the lead on this. And explain it? Yeah. Like what we did,
[13:35.320 --> 13:40.020]  how it went. Like, I think this is your story to tell. I was trying to avoid any information
[13:40.500 --> 13:46.760]  on the thing at all. Like I just, I texted you guys, don't tell me anything. I want to see it
[13:46.760 --> 13:51.820]  live. Then I went into the face discord and you guys posted about it on Instagram. And that's the
[13:51.820 --> 13:57.300]  only thing I saw. And I spoiled myself by going to the face spoilers thing. I saw the little place
[13:57.300 --> 14:02.280]  you were in, whatever the photo was. And I was completely, even after seeing the area in which
[14:02.280 --> 14:06.940]  the trick would happen, I felt like I was more confused than the verbal description. I could not
[14:06.940 --> 14:12.880]  see or tell where a trick would happen or like where you'd land. It was baffling. So I'm glad
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.780]  that you were still confused, Gavin, as much as I was upon seeing the location of the area.
[14:24.450 --> 14:30.630]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp Online Therapy. Life is full of stress. It doesn't matter
[14:30.630 --> 14:36.270]  who you are or what you have. Your life is probably stressful, especially these last
[14:36.270 --> 14:42.490]  18 months or so. It's been a whirlwind. You may not be feeling down right now or out, not depressed
[14:43.130 --> 14:48.650]  or like you're at a total loss. But if your stress is higher than normal, maybe your temper is a
[14:48.650 --> 14:52.630]  little shorter than usual, or even if you're starting to feel a strain on your relationships,
[14:52.670 --> 14:58.210]  you could probably use a chance to unload. That's where BetterHelp comes in. BetterHelp
[14:58.210 --> 15:03.450]  has customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with your
[15:03.450 --> 15:07.930]  therapist. So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to. It's much more

[16:53.330 --> 16:57.390]  I have the footage. I expected to see it.
[16:57.790 --> 17:03.170]  So how do we, how do we do this? Do you, do you want to just play it? Like put,
[17:03.350 --> 17:07.830]  upload it? Or do we talk about it first? No, I feel like I could just stream my screen through
[17:07.830 --> 17:12.070]  Discord. I put a little bit of, uh, put a little bit of music on it. A little bit of pizzazz. Put
[17:12.070 --> 17:17.550]  a little outro on it. Um, I've done some work on it. Do you want to just see it? Yeah, I would love,
[17:17.650 --> 17:24.450]  there's nothing more that I'd like to, oh my god, please. How, but while you're getting this ready,
[17:24.450 --> 17:29.290]  how long have we been talking about this stupid trick? Over a month. Uh, well, yeah, in real time,
[17:29.370 --> 17:34.050]  like a month, but in episode time, maybe two months. Yeah, probably. That's possible. Yeah,
[17:34.150 --> 17:38.750]  probably. Yeah. Okay. So it's going to be like the culmination of like a probably six,
[17:39.010 --> 17:43.290]  six or seven episode arc. Yeah. When these people finally get to see this trick, which
[17:43.610 --> 17:48.270]  when I get, I'm going to say this, we roll up on the scene and after Gavin kind of gets the
[17:48.270 --> 17:51.590]  hang of it, he goes, I'll be honest with you. I thought it was going to be a much smaller trick.
[17:51.590 --> 17:57.690]  And that made me feel good. A smaller trick. Is this the most impressive? Have you ever done a
[17:57.690 --> 18:03.430]  bike trick before this, Geoff? Is this your first trick? I'm 46 years old, man. But doing bike
[18:03.430 --> 18:07.930]  tricks my whole life. Well, okay. I just, I felt like, I don't know. I'll be honest with you, Andrew.
[18:08.070 --> 18:13.710]  I think I peaked somewhere around 13. So I think it's all been downhill from then. But I used to
[18:13.710 --> 18:18.410]  do a lot of, I used to do a lot of BMXing and skating when I was younger, for sure. And,
[18:18.410 --> 18:24.710]  I'd like to point out that when we watch this trick, when we finally get to it, I am not driving,
[18:25.030 --> 18:32.310]  this is not a trick bike. This is like a Cadillac. It's a big, smooth, heavy, beautiful,
[18:32.610 --> 18:36.150]  just put your hands back behind your bed and ride smooth kind of bike. So it doesn't have a lot of
[18:36.150 --> 18:43.550]  maneuverability. I'll preface it by saying that. Okay. Is everyone ready? Yes, please show me this
[18:43.550 --> 18:50.270]  trick. Here we go. Playing the bike stunt. Here we go. How long is this? Okay. So we're in.
[18:55.620 --> 19:12.360]  Wait. Okay. Wait. Oh, shit. That's fucking awesome. Boom. Yeah. I dropped my kickstand.
[19:12.360 --> 19:14.780]  It's back up. Rolled it out.
[19:23.870 --> 19:28.610]  That's a lot to take in. It just keeps going. Holy shit. Let's watch that a hundred more times.
[19:28.710 --> 19:35.770]  That was amazing. So, what was your reaction upon seeing the completion of the trick?
[19:37.150 --> 19:42.330]  What, in real life? Yeah, in real life. You get everything there. You're feeling the camera.
[19:43.070 --> 19:46.130]  Did it live up to your expectations? Let me just say, before he gets to say that,
[19:46.130 --> 19:52.510]  he had the benefit of seeing that trick, oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 times. He had a front row
[19:52.510 --> 19:58.190]  seat over and over and over again from every angle you can imagine. I first want to say,
[19:58.290 --> 20:03.890]  great trick, Geoff. Good job. I'm happy that you landed it. I don't understand how you could do
[20:03.890 --> 20:10.990]  that 15 to 20 times. You went up and over a thing, and then you, just through the momentum of going
[20:10.990 --> 20:18.090]  down, went over a little, you got a little bit of air. Well, I went, I climbed, I went up a bank
[20:18.090 --> 20:25.190]  about six feet in the air, and then I went down it, past a bridge, into a culvert, at this point,
[20:25.310 --> 20:30.370]  that's another three feet down, and then I went up the other side, did a sweet fucking jump,
[20:30.470 --> 20:34.430]  and then landed and rode it off. Smooth as can be. I just, I don't understand what the failed
[20:34.430 --> 20:37.650]  attempts would look like. I feel like that's what it should look like. There were no failed
[20:37.650 --> 20:44.210]  attempts on that day. Okay. I, when I first saw the trick, I do, I feel like I just fully didn't
[20:44.210 --> 20:48.310]  know what I was expecting. I was expecting him to just basically just do a bunny hop over something.
[20:48.770 --> 20:53.690]  So the fact that it extended all this, like, the fact that he covered so much distance was a shock
[20:53.690 --> 20:58.830]  to me. And when he did it, I was like, huh, all right. I, because I, it wasn't like it was a let
[20:58.830 --> 21:03.070]  down. I just fully didn't know what I was going to see, and I assumed it would actually be smaller
[21:03.070 --> 21:07.750]  than what it was. So do you think that if it was less distance, you'd be less impressed?
[21:08.170 --> 21:13.230]  This is the stretching of the thing, the distance covered? I was really hoping we would be slow
[21:13.230 --> 21:19.670]  mowing maybe like an inch and a half of air as Geoff like pops some sort of water system. I don't
[21:19.670 --> 21:24.790]  know. But the fact that it was quite long and he actually did get quite good air, it made it less
[21:24.790 --> 21:32.190]  funny. So that's why, um, that's why I did the punch-ins and the jet sound effects. I, I mean,
[21:32.190 --> 21:37.250]  that added a lot to it. I will say one of the, I think to me, the subtle funny thing of that
[21:37.250 --> 21:42.850]  video is the end when Geoff is riding in slowly and then it goes to slow motion. I couldn't tell
[21:42.850 --> 21:47.330]  when the slow motion started. He was going at such a slow speed for that, that cut in. Yeah,
[21:47.390 --> 21:51.530]  that was unfortunate because of the timing of the music. I wanted it to kick into slow-mo when
[21:51.530 --> 21:57.110]  that music kicks in, but I had to like extend the run up just by slowing it down. So he was,
[21:57.110 --> 22:01.510]  he's at like quarter speed coming up to that. I see. So that's on your end. That was, and I
[22:01.510 --> 22:05.890]  thought that was just Geoff's natural speed. He was booking it up to that bit. I was going pretty
[22:05.890 --> 22:11.010]  fucking fast. Yeah. And, uh, and I'd like to point out too, uh, that the point of this trick
[22:11.010 --> 22:16.070]  was never to go and find a cool trick and do it. Instead I ride my bike through that ditch every
[22:16.070 --> 22:21.110]  fucking day or probably five or six days a week. And you just like, you ride over the same spots
[22:21.110 --> 22:24.250]  over and over again. You want to do, you want to just like, you get bored. So I was like,
[22:24.290 --> 22:27.530]  I bet I could ride up there. And then, but then I did get stuck in this culvert and then you're
[22:27.530 --> 22:30.370]  like, Oh, can I jump my way out of the culvert? And then you're like, Oh, I guess I could. And
[22:30.370 --> 22:34.870]  you try it a few times slowly and you fall. Uh, and then I showed Gavin how I wiped out on the,
[22:34.970 --> 22:40.270]  on the, on the wall that I rode kind of explained to him how, how that wipe out went and which was
[22:40.270 --> 22:45.970]  a fucking terrible and terrifying wipe out. Let me tell you. And, uh, but it's, it was more of
[22:45.970 --> 22:50.390]  just like, uh, you just like, like driving my bike by that every day and just having it like
[22:50.390 --> 22:53.650]  itch at you. It's actually be like, I want to do something more fun here than just go down this
[22:53.650 --> 22:56.850]  path. And then I came up with this awesome fucking bad-ass trick. And then I did it. And then I did
[22:56.850 --> 23:02.030]  it a billion times for Gavin. And that wasn't even the best air I got. The best air I got was
[23:02.030 --> 23:06.970]  huge, but we decided to redo it for some reason. Wait, was the best day on like, uh, when I was
[23:06.970 --> 23:11.290]  filming the first bit, I think it was the time before that one. Yeah. You probably a little bit
[23:11.290 --> 23:17.650]  far away. Yeah. I wanted to get you nice and big in frame. I, I, that's, I mean, that was a trick
[23:17.650 --> 23:22.250]  for sure. I don't know what, I feel like you'll let down Andrew. It's not that I'm let down.
[23:22.250 --> 23:28.170]  It was great. I don't know. You know, like my favorite part is that the bike clearly not a
[23:28.170 --> 23:33.870]  tool design. It like it lands and it always snaps in half of the kickstand comes down and bashes
[23:33.870 --> 23:39.750]  the ground. The chain goes. In every slow-mo shot we have, you can see some in some of the other
[23:39.750 --> 23:44.450]  ones. The chain is like 80% on the ground. It's it somehow puts itself back together.
[23:46.010 --> 23:50.790]  I, I think I'm, it's not that I'm underwhelmed. I think I'm whelmed. It was what I was expecting.
[23:50.790 --> 23:56.730]  You're whelmed. You did a whelming bike trick, Geoff. It was a whelming, it was a solid, uh,
[23:57.210 --> 24:01.490]  it was, it's very much that they were who we thought they were moment. Like it is what I
[24:01.490 --> 24:07.450]  thought it was. And, uh, it was good. The edit, I mean, great video, great bike trick, Geoff. I'm,
[24:07.630 --> 24:12.590]  what I want is the continuation of this. Cause you said you go through that all the time and
[24:12.590 --> 24:16.330]  you're expanding. Is there more for you to do? Is there more ground to cover?
[24:16.330 --> 24:20.830]  Oh, a hundred percent. A hundred percent. Yeah. There's, there's a lot, there's more opportunity
[24:20.830 --> 24:25.370]  there for me. So like a year from now we might get multiple zigzags. You might be zigging up and
[24:25.370 --> 24:29.970]  down. This could be an expanded trick. This is just like the trial run. It's entirely possible
[24:29.970 --> 24:35.030]  for sure. Uh, I, but you gotta, you can't force it, you know, you gotta let, uh, inspiration
[24:35.030 --> 24:40.350]  strike. I feel like it was somehow simultaneously more and less of a trick than you thought it would
[24:40.350 --> 24:46.710]  at the same time, Andrew. It is. Uh, there's more to it. Uh, I just, I think it's the bike
[24:46.710 --> 24:51.270]  is the thing too. I need to consider, as you said, not designed to do that. It almost explodes on
[24:51.270 --> 24:55.410]  impact, which is very fun. If I was on, if I was on a tiny, like my little, like a little trick
[24:55.410 --> 24:59.310]  bike. Yeah. I've been a bit, at first I thought I got about four feet higher on the jump. It would
[24:59.310 --> 25:04.730]  have been, it would have been way easier to get up and to go over that, uh, over that drainage ditch
[25:04.730 --> 25:09.030]  that my bike does not turn that fast. And it's like, you can't really see it, but the angle I
[25:09.030 --> 25:14.530]  gotta come out of that, out of that, uh, tunnel, uh, and then make the hard cut. It's very difficult
[25:14.530 --> 25:19.650]  on that bike. Now does the pedal assist help with the speed? How much is that influencing your height?
[25:19.970 --> 25:25.110]  I would say the pedal assist provides most of the help at the beginning to get through the tunnel
[25:25.110 --> 25:30.710]  and up that ramp. And then it's just gravity and pedal and me after that. How far down the
[25:30.710 --> 25:35.270]  tunnel are you? Oh, I'm very far. Yeah. Oh, that's okay. See, that's a whole layer. I didn't realize
[25:35.270 --> 25:39.490]  that's not shown. I just assumed you're waiting and then you pop out. He came out of that tunnel like a bullet.
[25:39.830 --> 25:43.930]  I came out of that tunnel very... Well, he's on a pedal assist bike, Gavin. I don't know what that means
[25:43.930 --> 25:48.390]  as far as distance goes. He doesn't have to build through that. I came out of the, I came out of the tunnel
[25:48.390 --> 25:54.150]  hauling ass. It's, remember, it's slowed down to like a quarter speed or something. Okay. That was a
[25:54.150 --> 25:59.410]  great trick. It's like five percent speed. I think what you're missing, and hopefully Gavin will understand,
[25:59.630 --> 26:05.110]  is when you stand in this space and you see the totality of it, you see, like, when you're in the
[26:05.110 --> 26:10.130]  ditch and you see how tall and big everything is around you, then you understand the scale of what's
[26:10.130 --> 26:15.150]  going on, which is a totally different thing. I, you know, I agree. Honestly, it's warming up to me
[26:15.150 --> 26:19.470]  over time. I think I needed time to process the trick, really understand the specifics of it. I'm
[26:19.470 --> 26:25.110]  not a big bike guy. I, just hearing the extent, bringing up great details of the pedal and knowing
[26:25.110 --> 26:30.170]  the speeds, you've sold me on this. That is, that is a great trick. And I'm very excited about the
[26:30.170 --> 26:35.630]  extension of this going forward. Like a year from now. Would you attempt it yourself? On the same bike that
[26:35.630 --> 26:41.210]  Geoff's on? Like that type of bike? Yeah. I've never ridden that type of, I don't know. I don't know what
[26:41.210 --> 26:45.290]  that'd be like. So it's hard for me. What I, yeah, I think I would because I, if I eat shit, I eat shit.
[26:45.410 --> 26:51.050]  I don't, that's fine. Well, I also, if you guys are interested, I have a BMX in storage. I can pull out and
[26:51.050 --> 26:57.350]  pump the tires up and then we can just, we can just start getting tricky. I want to, okay. I want to know
[26:57.350 --> 27:02.630]  what getting tricky means to you. I'm very excited about this. I'd love for you to get tricky, Geoff.
[27:02.930 --> 27:08.350]  We can just start like making that a focus of things, you know, it's not like I don't have 46 years of daily
[27:08.350 --> 27:13.430]  bike riding behind me. I may not be in the weeds. I may, I may not be at the ninth street trails in
[27:13.430 --> 27:18.790]  Austin hitting fucking tabletops and stuff at this age, but I still, I still have the cumulative
[27:18.790 --> 27:23.530]  experience of all of my bicycle knowledge and all the dumb shit I've done in the past. I'm all
[27:23.530 --> 27:28.770]  about. Listen, you put a camera in front of me and I'm on a bike. I'll, I'll do some shit. Could you do,
[27:28.850 --> 27:31.830]  could you get air and then like spin the handlebars? That's the thing they do, right?
[27:31.930 --> 27:39.950]  That's a bike trick. I've never tried that in my life yet. Okay. But I would. What, so are we, so you get on
[27:39.950 --> 27:45.010]  the trick bike. Are you trying to reclaim former glory or are we like, we're going into uncharted
[27:45.010 --> 27:52.130]  territory? We're trying some tricks. I don't have any former glory. There's no former glory to attain.
[27:52.130 --> 28:02.430]  It's more of like, is it fun? And is it footage? And so far in my experience, uh, the answer to
[28:02.430 --> 28:07.990]  both questions was yes. Like Gavin and I actually, cause we were in that ditch for, I don't know,
[28:09.290 --> 28:16.470]  11 hours. Maybe it was, it was a lot of effort. Yeah. Is that we were joking about how much
[28:16.470 --> 28:23.030]  effort it was for how little reward probably, but also how much fucking fun that amount of
[28:23.030 --> 28:28.170]  effort for that production was. And like, we both were like, I wish we could do this more often. I
[28:28.170 --> 28:32.190]  wish we could come up with other dumb things to film and put this much effort into it for such
[28:32.190 --> 28:37.130]  a stupid thing. I'm really into the idea of all these little side bits that we do, especially now
[28:37.130 --> 28:41.690]  we have a YouTube channel. Is that where we're going to put this stuff? Yeah. No, I think,
[28:41.690 --> 28:45.170]  I think YouTube, I think it could go on Instagram as well, but I think this is definitely, I can
[28:45.170 --> 28:49.090]  make you a square version for Instagram if you want. That'd be great. Yeah. We could put that
[28:49.090 --> 28:54.510]  up on the, on the, on the socials and then we'll put the full video in all its glory up on YouTube.
[28:54.990 --> 28:58.790]  Uh, I want to know what Eric thought of it. Eric and Nick, if they, if they had any,
[28:58.930 --> 29:03.130]  yeah, please weigh in. Please weigh in. Uh, that was not the type of bike that I was anticipating
[29:03.130 --> 29:09.290]  you riding and doing a trick on. Uh, when the kickstand hits the ground and then comes back up,
[29:09.330 --> 29:14.810]  I thought the rest of the bike was going to explode. I was like, I was worried for you
[29:14.810 --> 29:19.970]  landing on that front tire so hard. Like, yeah, I know you would have told us like, yeah. And then
[29:19.970 --> 29:25.350]  I just went like, you know, over the front and ate shit. Like if that's what happened, but like,
[29:25.450 --> 29:32.010]  man, the way your front tire hit, I was like, Oh, that's the opposite of tricks. That was the least
[29:32.010 --> 29:38.110]  clean run we did. Uh, and it was the only one where I, I tried to tabletop it a bit in the air
[29:38.110 --> 29:42.670]  and I ended up landing further on the, on the front tire than the back. Uh, and, uh, two things,
[29:42.670 --> 29:49.290]  one, uh, probably one of the less impressive of the jumps because of that, uh, which is also why
[29:49.290 --> 29:54.910]  I think we should use it because it, uh, it was goofy. Also hurt. Hurt a lot. Yeah, you know,
[29:54.990 --> 29:58.670]  it looks like you see like all of the compression through the bike. Like first the front tire is
[29:58.670 --> 30:04.230]  like a pretty square on landing. The back tire, if you watch it, it gets totally bent to like the
[30:04.230 --> 30:10.210]  left and then your wrist is like the next thing to receive the impact. Let your sunglasses drop
[30:10.210 --> 30:15.230]  It's like you can see the shockwave traveling all through the bike into the top of your head.
[30:15.310 --> 30:21.330]  It's great. I felt it from my right wrist up to my elbow for at least 24 hours. We did different
[30:21.330 --> 30:25.770]  angles of the jump. Like there's, there's like a closer up angle, but it was a much cleaner landing
[30:25.770 --> 30:31.450]  and it wasn't nearly as funny as that other wide shot. So I just left it on that. I, I will say
[30:31.450 --> 30:42.250]  that, uh, besides like the jump, my favorite part of the video is you, I, I guess like
[30:42.970 --> 30:52.810]  sliding in at the end and just how long that goes on for. A very long time. A very long time
[30:53.370 --> 30:57.350]  sliding in the face. Music is like 30 seconds.
[31:01.130 --> 31:07.070]  It's a long ending, right? I want to watch it six more times. That's the problem. I want to
[31:07.070 --> 31:12.570]  see every, the people listening to this, get the joy of analyzing it. I want to see Geoff's
[31:12.570 --> 31:18.010]  face on impact. I mean, I could give you an, an analyst, an analyst analysis pass. If you
[31:18.010 --> 31:21.910]  want a second viewing, I'll also say to my favorite part of the video is something that
[31:21.910 --> 31:26.590]  no one has pointed out yet. Gavin noticed it immediately. Uh, but nobody else has pointed out.
[31:26.710 --> 31:30.990]  I think that the low key best part of the video. What is your favorite part? Let's see if you
[31:30.990 --> 31:35.530]  notice it on a, on another pass. Oh, we doing a second pass? I'd love to do a second pass. It
[31:35.530 --> 31:38.830]  takes like 20 minutes to get to the pass. Yeah, I don't know that we have to. I just was wearing
[31:38.830 --> 31:44.010]  a, it was just a shirt I was wearing. Okay, let's do this. If it just immediately works,
[31:44.070 --> 31:49.810]  I'm all about it. Okay, this is great. So let's reevaluate the second thing. So you're far down
[31:49.810 --> 31:53.470]  the tunnel. I appreciate there's no showing how far the tunnel gets, so we're just going to have
[31:53.470 --> 31:58.030]  to assume that you're far down. Well, I mean, in an analysis point of view, this is actually in
[31:58.030 --> 32:01.730]  slow motion at the beginning. I only have a, it only records for five seconds. So Geoff is like
[32:01.730 --> 32:07.150]  here, it's just in slow-mo and I speed up and he shoots out. All right, you ready? Analysis pass.
[32:09.030 --> 32:15.030]  Okay. Really long tunnel. The four, the frame. Look at, look at Geoff's positioning, the back,
[32:15.030 --> 32:24.770]  legs. Perfect landing. It's the audio commentary. Through the air, Geoff looks surprised and a little
[32:24.770 --> 32:30.370]  bit fearful. Clips a few leaves. I'm just, I was looking at the bike last time. I'm purely
[32:30.370 --> 32:38.410]  looking at Geoff this time. Impact, immediate in the hands, immediate in the face. Where did you
[32:38.410 --> 32:43.910]  get that shirt? Oh, I got a fucking awesome shirt is what I got. Yeah, where did you get that?
[32:43.910 --> 32:50.010]  Where can we get that? I bought it on eBay. No way, really? Yeah, I bought, there's a whole,
[32:50.150 --> 32:54.170]  there's, I got more than that. There are multiple Don Zimmer shirts available to buy.
[32:54.610 --> 32:58.130]  That just happens to be the one I was wearing that day. That's awesome. I know, if we could
[32:58.130 --> 33:02.410]  figure out a way to license that shirt, I would love to make a fuckface version. I mean, would
[33:02.410 --> 33:06.150]  it just be a case of contacting that photographer? Probably, probably contacting that photographer.
[33:06.390 --> 33:11.310]  It's fucking, we should sell that. I mean, I'm sure the, I bought it on eBay, dude. I'm sure
[33:11.310 --> 33:15.190]  it's not an official shirt, but we should officially sell that shirt. It's fucking awesome.
[33:15.910 --> 33:20.410]  Dude, I look good. I look young. I look fit. I look healthy. I got a tan. Watch the back,
[33:20.410 --> 33:24.990]  watch the back tie here. That was, no, that's the first thing I watched. It lands on like the,
[33:24.990 --> 33:33.410]  the skewed bit. It bounces and wiggles over. Goddamn, it hurt. I really thought the chain
[33:33.410 --> 33:38.070]  popped off the first time I watched it. It, uh, it does. It just pops itself back on every time.
[33:38.070 --> 33:44.150]  Goddamn, dude. And that was legit, maybe the 14th attempt. I think it was the 8th.
[33:44.210 --> 33:49.290]  Oh, 8th. I was running on empty by the end. Yeah. I didn't, after that one, you were all
[33:49.290 --> 33:53.770]  hunched over to the side. In my head, I was like, he's going to eat shit on the next one.
[33:57.910 --> 34:00.630]  Although eating shit would have looked amazing at that frame rate.
[34:00.950 --> 34:05.430]  I gotta say, I felt like there was no way for this trick to live up to the hype
[34:05.430 --> 34:10.450]  just because of the unfortunate, uh, way that we recorded this summer and we just had to keep
[34:10.450 --> 34:15.250]  pushing it off. But I'm still, but, but that being said, I'm, I think we did about as good a
[34:15.250 --> 34:20.130]  job with it as possible. It was a surprise because in my head, this was going one of two ways. So
[34:20.130 --> 34:25.450]  it's either going to be way, way more impressive than I could have imagined. Or like Gavin said,
[34:25.470 --> 34:28.710]  you're going to get an inch of air off this little jump and it would have been funny in a completely
[34:28.710 --> 34:33.470]  different way. You landed perfectly in the middle. It's a good trick. Not the greatest thing I've
[34:33.470 --> 34:37.770]  ever seen. Impact. Fantastic. What is the best bike trick you've ever done, Gavin?
[34:39.190 --> 34:43.390]  Um, I'm not sure I've ever done a bike trick. Oh, I used to do that thing. Was it ghosty?
[34:43.970 --> 34:46.150]  I don't know what that is. I have no idea.
[34:46.550 --> 34:50.330]  You like to start riding your bike down a hill and then you jump off and it keeps going and
[34:50.330 --> 34:55.230]  then you run and try and catch up with it and get back on it before it crashes into a parked car.
[34:55.770 --> 34:58.970]  That's an awesome trick I've never seen before. And you got to do, how do I film?
[34:59.510 --> 35:00.350]  Uh, find me a hill.
[35:01.010 --> 35:03.170]  Okay. And you'll teach me how to use the Phantom?
[35:06.890 --> 35:09.410]  Yeah. I feel like this is a great little window into,
[35:09.550 --> 35:13.710]  it's like a new avenue of little shitty high effort side content.
[35:14.230 --> 35:17.210]  Yeah. Yeah. It's like F*** Face Originals. Isn't that what we called it?
[35:20.310 --> 35:23.370]  And also it was, it was nice to, uh, like as we were walking out there,
[35:23.390 --> 35:26.830]  we were just talking about F*** Face. We're talking about some different aspects of the
[35:26.830 --> 35:32.150]  show. We were talking about how it's, it's kind of sad that we can't easily record with Andrew in
[35:32.150 --> 35:36.730]  person, but we will also talk about how much fun it is, Andrew, just to imagine you. And,
[35:36.830 --> 35:41.190]  and probably the imagine it like our own imagination of you is way better than the
[35:41.190 --> 35:45.870]  real you potentially. Wow. I don't know how to react to that. Well, the thing is I've met,
[35:45.930 --> 35:50.610]  I've met you twice. Um, and you know, it's been fine. One of the times you didn't talk to me or
[35:50.610 --> 35:54.810]  stand up because you were stuck in a chair. And the other time I assume it was the first time we
[35:54.810 --> 36:00.010]  met and it was very brief. So all of my best experiences with you have been just your voice
[36:00.010 --> 36:05.050]  and imagining you in person. That's true. We've definitely spent more time in that space,
[36:05.090 --> 36:08.870]  but I mean, that's for all you guys. It's just the distance. But who knows? You might,
[36:08.950 --> 36:14.910]  you might be a blast in person. I don't know what that means. I don't either. The fact that I don't,
[36:15.010 --> 36:17.710]  okay, well, if you don't, I was going to say, I don't know if that means I'm not,
[36:17.730 --> 36:20.910]  I don't know what you mean by that. Well, I just haven't spent that much time with you.
[36:20.910 --> 36:26.810]  Okay. You guys are in constant communication. You spend time together constantly. I mean,
[36:26.870 --> 36:29.750]  in real life, you don't spend any time with me in real life.
[36:31.890 --> 36:38.330]  What do you imagine is going on? Like what, what levels of fun? What is, what are you missing in
[36:38.330 --> 36:43.690]  the physical experience? What are you hoping for? I don't know. I just feel like the little snippets
[36:43.690 --> 36:49.570]  of your life that we hear about or see in picture form. Okay. You want to be in my kitchen at 1am
[36:49.570 --> 36:54.150]  with a kettle stuck on a ramen bowl is what you're saying. I think that is, I think what
[36:54.150 --> 37:00.410]  he's saying is, and if I'm hearkening back to the conversation we had, the imagining you going
[37:00.410 --> 37:05.430]  through these situations is probably more fun than seeing it in person, but it would still be
[37:05.430 --> 37:10.890]  fun to see in person. Yeah. I just, it's going back to like how the audience thought you sat
[37:10.890 --> 37:17.650]  in the dark. It's like, it's the imagination of you that's so intriguing. Yeah. But it's not like
[37:17.650 --> 37:21.850]  we, I mean, like I could be, if I let, we should do this for an episode one day. I'm not going to
[37:21.850 --> 37:26.210]  do it right now. I don't have the energy, but if I, I could probably walk out of my house right now,
[37:26.550 --> 37:31.650]  get in my car and drive to Gavin's house and be there in less than seven minutes, but not, but
[37:31.650 --> 37:38.030]  we don't ever, ever, ever, ever do that. Like we never spend time together in person. Yeah. I mean,
[37:38.030 --> 37:42.290]  there's a, there's been a good excuse. We, we have spent a lot of the last decade. I mean,
[37:42.290 --> 37:46.250]  we lived together for several years. Yeah. But I, yeah, yeah, I guess that's true.
[37:47.090 --> 37:49.450]  I guess I'm discounting all the time that we lived together.
[37:50.890 --> 37:56.170]  I was reminded of a situation the other day. It might've been in your drinking days. I'm not sure
[37:56.170 --> 38:00.070]  if you remember it. It probably was. It was in the morning. Uh, I just woke up. It was probably
[38:00.070 --> 38:04.270]  like a Saturday. I assume you'd been up for a bit. It was probably like eight 30 and I walk
[38:04.270 --> 38:09.650]  out into the main living room. And I think you're playing, playing some video game. And I, and you
[38:09.650 --> 38:14.110]  were like the couch layout. You were like sat slightly in front, like where you were on the
[38:14.110 --> 38:19.190]  TV. And I just sat on like the corner of the couch in the back. And I, and I was like, Oh, and you
[38:19.190 --> 38:24.830]  made, you made some sort of noise as if to acknowledge me. And the, I think Poppins was
[38:24.830 --> 38:29.510]  there too. Like it was that long ago. And then, uh, I was watching you play for a bit and you
[38:29.510 --> 38:34.050]  were just like, wait. And then I said something about the game you were playing. I was like,
[38:34.470 --> 38:38.710]  what does it mean when you do that? And you went, and you didn't know I was there.
[38:38.910 --> 38:42.770]  And it turns out the acknowledgement noise, you'd either been like saying something to the dog,
[38:42.810 --> 38:47.150]  or you just made like a grunt or something that was completely irrelevant to me. You had no idea
[38:47.150 --> 38:52.830]  that I'd come out of my room and sat behind you. And we scared the shit out of each other. And that
[38:52.830 --> 38:56.510]  was like some of the joyous moments of us living together. Do you, do you remember that at all?
[38:56.950 --> 39:01.970]  No, I don't remember that at all. That I, if it was Poppins though, I remember the house.
[39:01.970 --> 39:08.370]  We spent thousands of days together. It's true. And with Andrew, I'm at two. And so much of it
[39:08.370 --> 39:12.630]  was focused on making content together too. Like so much of it was us building shit in Minecraft
[39:12.630 --> 39:17.910]  or whatever for the other job. Yeah. It was usually like at least a few hours every Saturday
[39:17.910 --> 39:23.030]  and Sunday we'd be in Minecraft. I just, I remember there's another time we spent together,
[39:23.090 --> 39:27.090]  Gavin, and you made fun of, you laughed at me. So I don't feel like you're missing out on the
[39:27.090 --> 39:32.850]  experience. What did I say? No, it's not what you said. You laughed at my actions. We went to
[39:32.850 --> 39:39.430]  an arcade. It was you, Caleb, and I went to pinballs one time. And we were rotating out.
[39:39.530 --> 39:43.550]  I don't know if you'll remember this. We're rotating out on a time crisis machine. And I
[39:43.550 --> 39:47.250]  held the gun like you're supposed to hold a gun. And you, Caleb, just laughed at me.
[39:47.790 --> 39:52.950]  That was the, so that's, that's an experience you had. But I also, it wasn't a fun time. I remember
[39:52.950 --> 39:58.150]  I found, there's like a, what do you call like the quarter machine? Like the coin? Is it a coin
[39:58.150 --> 40:01.970]  pusher? Where like the thing goes in and out and you drop coins into it and you're trying to get
[40:01.970 --> 40:07.250]  usually like tokens and pinballs. Yeah. I didn't have, I like, I just had a $20 bill on me and I
[40:07.250 --> 40:12.110]  was like, I'll just put 20 into this. And that got me like 10,000 coins. So I spent the entire time
[40:12.110 --> 40:16.810]  just sat at this Wizard of Oz machine while you guys went around and had fun and did stuff.
[40:17.790 --> 40:22.030]  Andrew, honest question. What are the chances that I wasn't there?
[40:22.030 --> 40:27.290]  Uh, you were a hundred percent there. Absolutely. I have absolutely no memory of it. We picked you
[40:27.290 --> 40:32.850]  up and then we drove to pinballs and then Jack showed up later. Who did you actually pick up?
[40:34.350 --> 40:38.510]  It was you. Was this during your drinking days, Gavin? This is what we're going to find out.
[40:38.670 --> 40:42.990]  This is what we're going to find out this entire time. Andrew thought Gavin was Dan
[40:42.990 --> 40:49.210]  Grishy or Ben King. Some other British guy we know. I do. I didn't go. I was,
[40:49.210 --> 40:53.310]  I was never at pinballs with you. You a hundred percent were at pinballs with me.
[40:53.570 --> 40:57.150]  We need to get, ah, fuck. We need to ask. I was gonna say Caleb, but he died years ago.
[40:57.750 --> 41:02.870]  What about, we could ask a minor league fan, Jack, but we already did that bit. I could,
[41:03.010 --> 41:06.730]  I could try to call Caleb. I don't know if that works. I haven't talked to Caleb in a long time.
[41:07.090 --> 41:12.910]  I'm like 99% sure I've never been to pinballs with you. You are, you are a hundred percent.
[41:12.970 --> 41:17.230]  Should we put money on it? Should we wager? I would put anything on it.
[41:17.230 --> 41:22.210]  Surely I'd have pictures of that. No, there were, we didn't like, as I said, I spent,
[41:22.510 --> 41:26.570]  I understand why you'd not think I was there because I was married to a wizard of Oz machine
[41:26.570 --> 41:36.530]  for like 80% of our experience. I like, I like pinballs cause, uh, nobody goes there to play
[41:36.530 --> 41:41.830]  pinball. No, I went to the pinball machine and it was fun. There's a bunch, there's a great,
[41:41.930 --> 41:47.150]  but you're right. Pinball, pinball's great. I really like pinball. It's like the best thing
[41:47.150 --> 41:51.370]  to go do. But you like owning a machine is a nightmare from what I understand. Like it's one
[41:51.370 --> 41:55.910]  of the worst investments you can have just because of the constant maintenance, especially the old
[41:55.910 --> 42:01.090]  ones. Can't get a lot of parts. Hey, remind me before we end this podcast, I want to take a
[42:01.090 --> 42:06.330]  point of personal privilege to do a clarification on some condiment stuff. Uh, but, but not in a bad
[42:06.330 --> 42:12.030]  way. Oh, what was, what was the reaction to, uh, your participation in the condiment segment?
[42:12.650 --> 42:16.890]  Well, so I'll, I'll, I'll, let me just say, if you want to get into it now,
[42:16.950 --> 42:21.450]  if we're done with the pinball saga, I still think we should sort of bet. I agree. Well,
[42:21.630 --> 42:24.910]  let's see. I just, I would love to know who you picked. I'm going to call Caleb right now.
[42:25.070 --> 42:29.890]  Yeah. Please call Caleb right now. Uh, and I guess I should say Caleb is, uh, if you're listening to
[42:29.890 --> 42:34.430]  this podcast and you don't know who the fuck Caleb is, uh, why would you? Can you hear me?
[42:35.190 --> 42:39.770]  I can hear you. Okay. Caleb, Caleb, you gotta let them know you're on a, you're on a podcast.
[42:39.770 --> 42:44.690]  Caleb, you're on, I already, I told him that already. He knows he's on. No, you didn't hear
[42:44.690 --> 42:47.910]  it. Cause I missed it. It doesn't matter. Caleb, do you remember when we went to pinballs?
[42:48.830 --> 42:53.170]  To pinballs? Yes. The first time I went to Austin, I stayed with you. We went to pinballs.
[42:53.290 --> 42:57.250]  He took me to pinballs. I mean, it sounds about right. I honestly don't have a recollection of
[42:57.250 --> 43:02.630]  it though. That's unfortunate for me. I, I, you, you took me to pinballs and we picked up Gavin
[43:02.630 --> 43:07.950]  and we all went to pinballs. Gavin says it never happened. It definitely happened. Definitely
[43:07.950 --> 43:12.090]  happened. You do not sound confident. I'm confident cause I know I've gone to pinballs
[43:12.090 --> 43:18.510]  with you. And I know I've gone to pinballs with Gavin. And so chances are that you were both there,
[43:18.690 --> 43:22.870]  but I don't remember if you both were there. Okay. That's not a, that's not confirmation.
[43:23.330 --> 43:26.950]  He's like, he's like, hold up. His kid's talking. He's like, hold on, sweetie. Daddy's lying real
[43:26.950 --> 43:32.050]  fast. Uh, I'd first like to point out how much Andrew nailed having someone on speakerphone
[43:32.050 --> 43:36.850]  come through discord. That was, it's not hard. It's not hard. I don't know how Geoff
[43:36.850 --> 43:42.510]  ballsed it up with Jack. You point the thing at the mic. Uh, that's what I did. So sorry.
[43:42.610 --> 43:46.010]  What you, your condiments, you want to talk about condiments? I was, I missed it. I don't think,
[43:46.070 --> 43:50.990]  I don't think that was a, I don't think calling Caleb has proved anything. No, it didn't. It
[43:50.990 --> 43:55.830]  confirms that he's with the pinballs. It reminded me that Caleb is content cancer. He's good for
[43:55.830 --> 44:01.750]  that. No, he's not. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. We made a video with Caleb that I think
[44:01.750 --> 44:06.990]  is great. Yeah. He's a little, he's a little screen looker. Andrew name, anything else that
[44:06.990 --> 44:13.330]  happened at pimples that would trigger my memory? Like a conversation we had. Okay. So, um, what
[44:13.330 --> 44:18.210]  does that, that game? We also did the thing where, uh, you, the, the lift goes up and you got
[44:18.210 --> 44:22.010]  to get the key through the hole to win the prize. It's at the front at that time was at the front
[44:22.010 --> 44:26.090]  of the arcade. I did that. And you watched everybody watch. And then the guy, there's
[44:26.090 --> 44:30.710]  somebody who recognized you guys. And he ran over and yelled at me. He was like, no, don't do it.
[44:30.710 --> 44:34.570]  It's not ready yet. Like that machine will not give you anything. Do not put money into that.
[44:35.010 --> 44:42.090]  You know what? I have 100% remember that. I was playing, I was there on the key. You were
[44:42.090 --> 44:46.190]  pointing, I believe at the thing to try to give me a point of reference of where I was before.
[44:46.570 --> 44:51.530]  Yeah. And I didn't get close. Go through the slot every like thousand attempts. Yeah. And he was
[44:51.530 --> 44:55.870]  like, it's nowhere close to being at that thousandth attempt. Like the guy, it was like, I was about
[44:55.870 --> 45:01.210]  to die or something like step on a landmine. And the guy was like, no, don't stop. Just see in my
[45:01.210 --> 45:05.530]  head. That was Jack that was saying it's not ready. No. Well, Jack was there too. He came in
[45:05.530 --> 45:12.750]  in the middle, but it was, we picked you up and we dropped you off. You're absolutely right.
[45:13.990 --> 45:19.930]  Why would I make that up? What a weird, it was me. I have that memory, but you're not there.
[45:21.310 --> 45:27.130]  That's so messed up. I wonder who I replaced you with. Jack, apparently. Yeah. You, uh, you,
[45:27.410 --> 45:32.610]  yeah, but it wasn't Jack playing in my, you copied and pasted Jack over Andrew's face in your memory.
[45:34.870 --> 45:39.830]  Man, we've hung out more than I remember. I mean, not a lot. Like it's gone from two times
[45:39.830 --> 45:44.950]  to three times, but yeah, that is that dude. That's a 50% increase. Yeah, that is true.
[45:45.290 --> 45:49.370]  I'm excited for the next time we hang out. I like, yeah, we need to figure, I feel like there's going
[45:49.370 --> 45:56.490]  to be a lot of pressure though. Oh, not only, Oh shit. Not only, Oh my God. Caleb has a fucking
[45:56.490 --> 46:04.910]  picture of it. And he put it up with a date, April 17th, 2015. There's Gavin Free and Andrew
[46:06.390 --> 46:12.350]  standing next to each other playing time crisis. And you both look, by the way, you both look
[46:12.350 --> 46:19.250]  very unhappy. It was, I think it was the first, no, it was, I guess the second night. I don't know.
[46:19.370 --> 46:22.570]  I'll be honest, Andrew. I had no idea that there was a picture of us together.
[46:23.010 --> 46:31.470]  It existed. I didn't know that either. I had no idea. Holy shit. Damn. What I think is fascinating
[46:31.470 --> 46:35.850]  is that what I remember about that experience, you've disregarded. And the thing that I had to
[46:35.850 --> 46:41.630]  like dig up and try to refine in my brain was like, that was the moment for you. So now what
[46:41.630 --> 46:49.190]  was the, what were the terms when Gavin lied? You have to eat the dead wasps now, right? Is that what
[46:49.870 --> 46:56.010]  Andrew, there's a picture of us together. Yeah. Oh, I mean that. Yeah, it exists. I don't know
[46:56.010 --> 47:00.310]  what to say. This is not at all extraordinary to me. This is just the memory I have. You know,
[47:00.370 --> 47:08.970]  your nose does look sturdy. I'll give you that. God, our friend Caleb delivers again. I always
[47:08.970 --> 47:18.570]  say that guy's content's old. Yep. That's what you always say. Oh man. Wow. Phenomenal. I feel
[47:18.570 --> 47:23.670]  like such a knob now. Andrew, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot you were there. Hey, no, that's
[47:23.670 --> 47:29.210]  fine. I don't, it was uneventful. As I said, my memory is you guys laughing at me. So it's okay.
[47:29.370 --> 47:33.810]  It's fine that you've erased it. So you were holding the gun like a firearm. That's most of
[47:33.810 --> 47:38.390]  my memory of you guys. I was. Were you doing like trigger discipline? Well, that's the thing. I
[47:38.390 --> 47:42.750]  I've never really watched anyone else play light gun games. I assume they hold the gun like you're
[47:42.750 --> 47:46.470]  supposed to hold a gun. And you guys thought I was taking it way too seriously, I guess. I just
[47:46.470 --> 47:59.490]  thought I was playing the game. It's not my fault you're lazy at gun games. Wow. Caleb has impressed
[47:59.490 --> 48:06.170]  me a lot with that. What a fun little episode. What a great little gift this turned out to be.
[48:06.170 --> 48:10.970]  I want to know about the condiments, because I feel like we keep like and then pulling away.
[48:11.190 --> 48:18.750]  So I should preface by saying, I listened to that episode as I heard my girlfriend listening to it
[48:18.750 --> 48:25.290]  as well. And after she listened to that episode, she had a goddamn intervention with me about
[48:25.290 --> 48:31.310]  whether I'm depressed and miserable or not in life. And I had to, sure, I'm in a lovely place
[48:31.310 --> 48:37.090]  right now. But I will admit that I sound particularly down in that episode. And I'd like
[48:37.090 --> 48:40.930]  to say that part of it, I think, and I don't know if you guys have listened to the most recent
[48:40.930 --> 48:47.790]  episode with the condiment fight. I remember it. There's somewhere between, and I don't want to
[48:47.790 --> 48:53.370]  aggrandize, but I think there's legitimately somewhere between five and 20 minutes of me
[48:53.370 --> 48:59.750]  yelling at you guys that Nick very rightly cut out. I think it's a masterpiece by Nick's part
[48:59.750 --> 49:04.810]  for how that episode turned out compared to what it was like recording it. There's a lot of me
[49:05.350 --> 49:12.470]  articulating the finer points of my argument that got cut, which is totally fine. I think I think
[49:12.470 --> 49:19.530]  the best possible job of cutting that episode together. But it goes from me like ramping up
[49:19.530 --> 49:23.290]  and then suddenly I'm very defeated. And you missed the part where I explode over and over
[49:23.290 --> 49:28.930]  again and get tired. And so I feel very, I look very defeated at the end of it. And I guess I was,
[49:28.930 --> 49:33.930]  not to mention the fact that it also happened like right around the time that like my uncle died and
[49:33.930 --> 49:39.190]  I had to go out of town and I was doing a lot of traveling and juggling and everything in my house
[49:39.190 --> 49:43.230]  was on fire. And I was just like kind of particularly beat down. And then I went on
[49:43.230 --> 49:48.530]  vacation and I feel fucking great right now. So I had to, I had to sway Emily's fears. I was worried
[49:48.530 --> 49:56.410]  that that one couldn't come out because it was like, none of this is funny if the anger is real,
[49:56.410 --> 50:02.050]  in my opinion. And it was, it was getting real. Nick cleaned up some of the more real stuff
[50:02.050 --> 50:06.070]  and I actually sent him a message afterwards. I was like, wow, you completely saved that episode.
[50:06.210 --> 50:10.490]  I don't know how you did it. That must've been like surgery. But because of, uh, because of a
[50:10.490 --> 50:14.850]  lot of it being cut, including a lot of like my, the point of my arguments and the meat of my
[50:14.850 --> 50:19.210]  arguments, there are two, there are two little inconsistencies that have, that I I've seen pop
[50:19.210 --> 50:24.750]  up over and over again by comment leavers that I would just like to clarify, take a point of
[50:24.750 --> 50:31.490]  personal privilege to clarify. Uh, one people seem to be, I guess, by the way I wrote my initial
[50:31.490 --> 50:35.890]  recipe or the way it was written or read, people seem to get the impression that the tater tots
[50:35.890 --> 50:41.170]  were a part of the recipe. They never were. The tater tots were, we were designing the ultimate
[50:41.170 --> 50:47.090]  condiment for tater tots. It was a tot dipper or a tot sauce. And so people keep saying like,
[50:47.130 --> 50:51.630]  like approaching it, like I was saying, part of the, my recipe is to create tater tots.
[50:51.630 --> 50:56.050]  It wasn't. You got to take that out of the, out of the, like the tater tots are there in Gavin's
[50:56.050 --> 51:00.730]  meal. They're there in Andrew's meal as well. So you can't, you can't hit me for cooking tater
[51:00.730 --> 51:05.390]  tots. That's, that's just ludicrous. I mean, it comes down in general to the fact that
[51:05.910 --> 51:10.590]  the whole thing started from French, which is French dressing and ranch. And we, and the
[51:10.590 --> 51:14.470]  conversation was which condiments would you mix together to make the ultimate condiment? And we
[51:14.470 --> 51:18.950]  just didn't tell you that that was the origin of it. That's the other, that's the other part of
[51:18.950 --> 51:23.090]  conversation. It was just, it was just omitted because we were all in on it to begin with.
[51:23.450 --> 51:26.230]  I think that that's the other thing that gets dropped. And the other point I wanted to make
[51:26.230 --> 51:32.810]  is I had no access to this French conversation. I had no, I had no breaking bad context, like
[51:32.810 --> 51:38.870]  context. It literally started for me when Andrew said, could you design the ultimate condiment?
[51:39.250 --> 51:42.350]  And I said, so I just have to build a condiment and you go, whatever you want, make a condiment.
[51:42.490 --> 51:46.890]  So I didn't understand the context or the history behind it. I was just trying to make a condiment.
[51:46.890 --> 51:53.010]  The only rules I was given were make the ultimate condiment for tater tots. And in my head,
[51:53.290 --> 51:56.710]  as soon as I heard tater tots, I thought ketchup or cheese, that ketchup seemed like too easy,
[51:56.810 --> 52:00.710]  an easy route to go. So I went with cheese and I went down the cheese route. But I just want to
[52:00.710 --> 52:05.090]  make those two points of clarification. You stop telling me that I misunderstood the French argument
[52:05.090 --> 52:11.590]  because I never heard the French argument. Well, and then everyone else kind of did the same thing
[52:11.590 --> 52:16.810]  though. I think you went way out on left field. I do like that you're too clarification. No,
[52:17.090 --> 52:23.750]  this isn't, this is not heated at all at any way. The thing that you're saying is about to
[52:23.750 --> 52:29.050]  get me heated and unfair. I was trying to be very magnanimous about it. I was just trying to clear
[52:29.050 --> 52:34.010]  up these two little points of conversation. The only information I was given is design the ultimate
[52:34.010 --> 52:38.750]  condiment. That's totally true. I didn't have the same information y'all did. You did not have the
[52:38.750 --> 52:42.830]  context. I assume Nick probably had a little bit more of that French context than I did.
[52:43.270 --> 52:49.010]  No, he did not. He did the same as you did. The thing is when I say that it's like, it's not fun
[52:49.010 --> 52:53.670]  if the anger is real. I feel like I should also clarify, like when we do get annoyed at stuff in
[52:53.670 --> 52:58.210]  the episode or when stuff is frustrating in our lives, it is like, it is real anger. Like it is
[52:58.210 --> 53:05.090]  like, we're not just pretending, but it's when the anger ends with, man, do I even want to make this
[53:05.090 --> 53:09.650]  podcast anymore? That's when I feel like it's, it's gone too far. It's not like we're pretending
[53:09.650 --> 53:12.790]  all the rest of the time. It's just like, you don't want it to be, you don't want to have a
[53:12.790 --> 53:17.870]  detrimental effect on the people in it. For sure. For sure. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. That wasn't even
[53:17.870 --> 53:21.650]  for me a thing of anger. I was just more confused by everything that was happening. I didn't
[53:21.650 --> 53:27.830]  understand what was going on or why. Nobody was more confused than me from the constant gaslighting
[53:28.350 --> 53:34.890]  and... There was no gaslighting! It's confusing. Like, no, no, okay, no, no, I'm not doing a bit,
[53:35.110 --> 53:38.710]  but if you want to get into it, like, you literally are telling me, see, I think you've
[53:38.710 --> 53:43.030]  designed a lovely condiment, but what we're asking for is a sauce. And then later on, you tell me
[53:43.030 --> 53:47.950]  this is a sauce, not a condiment. There was a lot of confusing, uh, conversation going around left
[53:47.950 --> 53:52.510]  and right there. So I don't, look, I don't want to get upset again. All I wanted to say is that,
[53:53.390 --> 53:58.890]  all I wanted to say is that I don't think it's fair for people to complain that tater tots are
[53:58.890 --> 54:04.970]  a part of my recipe, because they were a part of everybody's recipe. And I, nobody told me about
[54:04.970 --> 54:09.970]  the French conversation. They just said, make a condiment. That's all. That's fair. And so I made
[54:09.970 --> 54:13.530]  a condiment. I made a condiment for tater tots, because that's what I was asked to do. Well,
[54:13.570 --> 54:17.230]  even though that bit didn't go the way that we'd originally planned, would you be offended,
[54:17.230 --> 54:24.610]  Geoff, if in future, I do make your tot condiment and eat it on a show? Would I be offended? Well,
[54:24.670 --> 54:28.310]  like, is it going to bring up, you know, is it going to bring up the past? Because I actually
[54:28.310 --> 54:32.050]  genuinely want to eat that. Like, it does sound good. Yeah, it sounds like, it was never in
[54:32.050 --> 54:39.270]  question of, is it good? What you made sounds delicious. Is it, uh, is it, if you do it, no,
[54:39.350 --> 54:45.490]  if Andrew does it, probably. If I'm just being honest, because I know how you would treat it
[54:45.490 --> 54:49.290]  and handle it and deal with it. And I know how he would, and you would be respectful and he would
[54:49.290 --> 54:57.110]  be funny. Okay. Now I don't know how to process that because I wouldn't. You process it however
[54:57.110 --> 55:02.570]  you feel. It's not meant to be an insult. I just, I just think I know both of your sense of humors.
[55:02.650 --> 55:07.650]  I know how you handle situations. And I think that I would, I think Gavin would be a little,
[55:07.970 --> 55:12.390]  uh, Gavin knows me better than just about anybody. And I think that he would handle it in a way that
[55:12.390 --> 55:17.450]  would keep me from blowing my top. Maybe it would be, maybe it should be the first thing we do in
[55:17.450 --> 55:23.510]  person. Ooh, a cooking, like a cooking segment? No, just like they're in the middle of the table.
[55:24.070 --> 55:29.470]  Oh, okay. Yeah. Once again, I don't want to get into a whole, I don't want to get into a sauce
[55:29.470 --> 55:33.970]  versus condiment versus dipping sauce versus whether I was taking it too far or whatever.
[55:34.370 --> 55:39.970]  All I'm saying is, I didn't, I didn't know about the French conversation. I didn't understand the
[55:39.970 --> 55:44.750]  breaking bad of it. It was never communicated to me. And it's, it's weird that people would
[55:45.250 --> 55:50.830]  say my, my, my dip and sauce or my condiment was too complicated because you have to make
[55:50.830 --> 55:53.970]  tater tots because that was a part of it for everybody. I just want to be judged,
[55:53.970 --> 55:58.170]  uh, on the same merits as everyone else. I like that. Just two clarifications
[55:59.130 --> 56:03.430]  were the audience is wrong for assuming this. And also you guys are wrong.
[56:03.450 --> 56:07.190]  And it was edited out why I was so right. Those are your two clarifications.
[56:07.190 --> 56:13.170]  No, my clarification is the audience seems to has misconstrued that tater tots were a part
[56:13.170 --> 56:17.410]  of my ingredient or were a part of the process and they're not. And two,
[56:17.490 --> 56:20.830]  that I wasn't a part of the French conversation. Those are my only two points of clarity. And I
[56:20.830 --> 56:25.510]  don't, and I don't think either of those pushes that on the audience in any way. I'm just cleaning
[56:25.510 --> 56:29.510]  up a miscommunication. I even gave the audience the benefit of the doubt. And I said, I can
[56:29.510 --> 56:34.630]  understand how they would draw those conclusions because of Nick's amazing job of editing it,
[56:34.630 --> 56:40.270]  but he edited out the vast majority of that conversation. And once again, rightly so.
[56:40.430 --> 56:43.670]  So I just wanted to clear up those two little things. It's not an attack on the audience or
[56:43.670 --> 56:48.310]  it's not attack on either view. I feel like I was polite and respectful to everyone involved.
[56:48.810 --> 56:53.450]  What I've learned from this experience is I would put, and I didn't know this, I would now put
[56:54.510 --> 56:58.570]  definitions of sauce and the same category of people being like, I don't want to talk politics.
[56:58.570 --> 57:04.150]  It's going to get heated. Don't talk about sauce definitions. It's I, I tweeted because I made a
[57:04.150 --> 57:08.970]  Venn diagram because I went in because I was trying to, I wanted to find common ground within
[57:08.970 --> 57:14.270]  the episode. And it just, we didn't, it didn't work. But people are like, I don't consider
[57:14.270 --> 57:17.990]  olive oil a sauce. And I'm like, well, then what is it? Like, what would you consider?
[57:18.570 --> 57:25.770]  What is olive oil? That's interesting. Like, is an oil? What is oil? I think it's so clearly a
[57:25.770 --> 57:33.270]  sauce. Is it a base? Well, let me read everydayhealth.com. Well, it's going to, because I'm
[57:33.270 --> 57:39.690]  curious now too. Uh, olive oil is a liquid fat. You don't, no one's like, you want some fat on
[57:39.690 --> 57:44.750]  your salad. Like, what do you mean? I'm just saying what the definition of it is on Wikipedia.
[57:44.930 --> 57:49.050]  It says olive oil is a liquid fat. We should, Andrew, you should try and make the highest
[57:49.050 --> 57:57.590]  calorie salad possible. Why? Okay. It's, it's listed as a cooking oil. Okay. Culinarily it's,
[57:57.590 --> 58:04.630]  it's listed as a staple cooking oil. People are arguing that it's a dipping sauce. It's also used,
[58:04.790 --> 58:10.350]  extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a salad dressing or an ingredient in salad dressings.
[58:10.810 --> 58:14.610]  So, but it can be dipped in like a bit of a oil and vinegar with a bit of Italian bread.
[58:14.690 --> 58:18.870]  It's fantastic. I had that last night. I had that last night actually. Damn. Yeah.
[58:19.730 --> 58:24.970]  Eric's gonna, gonna blow his top. How long have we been going for? I'm in another meeting. People
[58:24.970 --> 58:29.810]  are talking to me while I have to listen to this. I'm fucking losing my mind. Are you like one,
[58:29.970 --> 58:33.890]  are you in one ear and then the meetings in the other ear? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what's up guys? I'm
[58:33.890 --> 58:37.950]  still in the f*** face recording, but now they can hear me. Thank you so much for listening to
[58:37.950 --> 58:42.630]  this episode of f*** face. If you guys want to follow us at f*** face pod on Instagram and on
[58:42.630 --> 58:47.950]  Twitter, check us out on YouTube. Just check out any of the new content that we have on our YouTube
[58:47.950 --> 58:52.530]  channel. It's a lot of fun. Another place for you to consume the content. And, um, we'll see you
[58:52.530 --> 58:57.970]  next time where apparently we're going to argue about tater tots again for a month straight. This
[58:57.970 --> 59:04.150]  is ridiculous. Into his being right now. Yes. I like, I like that this guy is complaining.
[59:04.970 --> 59:09.650]  This sucks. I like that this guy's complaining about our content while trying to shut down
[59:09.650 --> 59:16.030]  content. Oh my God. Andrew's face just exploded by the sound of it. What happened? I'm trying to,
[59:16.490 --> 59:19.730]  cause Eric is ending the show. It's like, I want to see what's happening with the fire
[59:19.730 --> 59:28.330]  extinguisher bag. I just cracked it open. Oh my God. Oh, oh, he just does stuff without any
[59:28.330 --> 59:32.910]  warning. What are you reacting to? Is it, does it smell? Is it over? Can you breathe?
[59:35.770 --> 59:48.950]  Oh God. Oh, the velociraptor. I'm poisoned now. I'm poisoned. End the show. It's bookended
[59:48.950 --> 59:56.770]  with poison. End the show. Well, tune in, tune in next week when Nick and Eric and I will still be
[59:56.770 --> 01:00:01.390]  alive. The wasp spray floated to Canada.
