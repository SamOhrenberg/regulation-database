[00:33.570 --> 00:38.590]  Hello and welcome to episode 66 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:39.030 --> 00:40.790]  A special edition.
[00:41.470 --> 00:43.290]  This is the Andrew Panton.
[00:43.290 --> 00:47.030]  And this is your birthday. Happy 27th birthday, buddy.
[00:47.490 --> 00:49.090]  Well, he's not ready, though, I don't think.
[00:49.110 --> 00:50.070]  I'm not ready!
[00:50.290 --> 00:53.830]  He said, hang on, it's 15 minutes after 3 o'clock.
[00:54.430 --> 00:55.770]  And we're still not going.
[00:55.970 --> 00:59.510]  I was here on time. Technical difficulty. Can you hear me okay?
[00:59.890 --> 01:01.010]  Yes, we hear you fine.
[01:01.010 --> 01:02.130]  Okay, great.
[01:03.350 --> 01:04.890]  Okay. Hey.
[01:05.430 --> 01:06.110]  What's up?
[01:07.330 --> 01:11.330]  Once again, what is the purpose of being here on time if you're not ready?
[01:11.330 --> 01:14.350]  I was ready. I didn't know I wasn't ready.
[01:14.450 --> 01:15.610]  I was here on time.
[01:17.290 --> 01:18.570]  Are you recording?
[01:19.470 --> 01:20.130]  I am recording.
[01:20.550 --> 01:21.810]  Oh, nice. Hey, Andrew.
[01:22.550 --> 01:23.630]  Happy birthday.
[01:23.970 --> 01:27.490]  Thank you. Happy birthday to you.
[01:28.390 --> 01:29.830]  Happy birthday to you.
[01:29.830 --> 01:30.590]  We don't need to do this.
[01:31.350 --> 01:33.850]  Happy birthday, dear Andrew.
[01:34.330 --> 01:35.310]  Happy birthday to you.
[01:35.670 --> 01:38.550]  That's the first time that song has been sung with those notes.
[01:38.550 --> 01:40.990]  Well, I have to get it. It's copyright.
[01:41.270 --> 01:42.290]  I gotta get around the copyright.
[01:43.010 --> 01:44.190]  You gotta sing it slightly different.
[01:44.470 --> 01:46.590]  It's actually a pro move on my part.
[01:47.710 --> 01:49.510]  Face66, Andrew, you're 27.
[01:49.790 --> 01:50.690]  Congratulations. Happy birthday.
[01:50.790 --> 01:52.950]  How does it feel to be 27? What did you get for your birthday?
[01:53.010 --> 01:55.130]  What are you doing for your birthday? What's on the agenda?
[01:55.510 --> 01:57.070]  Well, I'm using a new setup.
[01:57.370 --> 01:59.450]  Is, I'd say, the highlight of my birthday.
[01:59.650 --> 02:01.410]  Unrelated to the technical...
[02:01.410 --> 02:01.770]  No.
[02:02.230 --> 02:03.330]  No, I did not.
[02:07.730 --> 02:08.530]  So yesterday...
[02:08.530 --> 02:11.190]  I did. Yeah, it's my favorite thing.
[02:11.690 --> 02:13.930]  Yesterday, my chair broke.
[02:14.430 --> 02:17.610]  I've been using a broken desk chair
[02:17.610 --> 02:19.650]  since before this podcast started.
[02:20.270 --> 02:23.350]  And my dream was that it would break while we were recording.
[02:23.570 --> 02:24.350]  That was the goal.
[02:25.390 --> 02:26.550]  I'd just been waiting.
[02:27.150 --> 02:28.850]  And yesterday, I dropped something
[02:28.850 --> 02:30.630]  and I bent down to pick it up
[02:30.630 --> 02:31.310]  while in the chair
[02:31.310 --> 02:32.770]  and the chair broke.
[02:33.030 --> 02:34.130]  Finally, it was the end.
[02:34.590 --> 02:35.450]  Dumped me on the floor.
[02:36.190 --> 02:37.610]  You don't have the best luck with chairs.
[02:37.610 --> 02:39.350]  No, I don't. I got great chair luck
[02:39.350 --> 02:41.430]  in the worst way. It broke.
[02:42.030 --> 02:43.350]  I don't have...
[02:43.350 --> 02:45.610]  I own three chairs and none of them
[02:45.610 --> 02:46.730]  would work for this.
[02:47.330 --> 02:49.350]  I have my desk chair
[02:49.350 --> 02:51.570]  and then I have these two big
[02:51.570 --> 02:53.390]  like lazy boy type chairs
[02:53.390 --> 02:55.990]  on a different level that I couldn't bring up.
[02:56.370 --> 02:57.210]  So I don't have a chair
[02:57.210 --> 02:59.630]  for this was the
[02:59.630 --> 03:01.730]  great dilemma. So I've had to rewire my
[03:01.730 --> 03:03.650]  setup and unrelated
[03:03.650 --> 03:05.330]  to my issues, but
[03:05.750 --> 03:06.790]  it's pretty great.
[03:07.030 --> 03:09.290]  This might be a first in the company's history.
[03:09.610 --> 03:11.390]  I'm not sure. Eric might
[03:11.390 --> 03:12.290]  know, but
[03:13.210 --> 03:15.410]  let me make sure I'm recording. Let me grab
[03:15.410 --> 03:16.730]  my binoculars. One sec.
[03:17.990 --> 03:19.370]  Why would I? Geoff
[03:19.370 --> 03:20.810]  started the company. Why would I know?
[03:20.810 --> 03:23.310]  Yeah, but you're the podcast. I view you as more of a podcast
[03:23.310 --> 03:24.870]  person, Geoff. Although Geoff's on several.
[03:25.710 --> 03:27.230]  Don't blame me for this company.
[03:27.670 --> 03:29.310]  I'm not blaming you for it. I am recording. We're good.
[03:30.750 --> 03:31.630]  Okay. Gotta be careful.
[03:32.330 --> 03:33.510]  Are you stood up?
[03:34.050 --> 03:34.450]  No.
[03:34.950 --> 03:36.370]  Are you outside?
[03:36.990 --> 03:37.390]  No.
[03:38.910 --> 03:40.330]  He's on his bed, isn't he?
[03:41.350 --> 03:43.650]  Okay. Well, the weight balance is a little bit of an issue.
[03:43.850 --> 03:45.010]  My mic keeps trying to fall over.
[03:45.410 --> 03:46.550]  We're fine. We're good.
[03:47.850 --> 03:49.210]  I'll post in the Discord
[03:49.210 --> 03:50.150]  my setup right now.
[03:51.890 --> 03:53.290]  If this was a tip or foam
[03:53.290 --> 03:55.250]  mattress, you could have a glass of wine next to you
[03:55.250 --> 03:56.250]  and not worry about it.
[03:57.450 --> 03:59.110]  It's very difficult to use
[03:59.110 --> 04:01.390]  binoculars and a mouse at the same time.
[04:01.390 --> 04:02.590]  Try to see my screen.
[04:04.410 --> 04:05.730]  I'm guessing you're on the bed.
[04:05.810 --> 04:06.650]  The mouse is on the bed.
[04:06.770 --> 04:08.330]  And you're using binoculars
[04:08.930 --> 04:10.390]  to look at the screen.
[04:10.570 --> 04:12.350]  Yeah, because we post photos a lot.
[04:12.490 --> 04:15.110]  Also for recording, I needed it here.
[04:15.190 --> 04:17.570]  This is my setup right now.
[04:19.190 --> 04:20.150]  This is what I got going.
[04:22.670 --> 04:24.170]  I didn't have a chair, so I was like,
[04:24.190 --> 04:27.230]  what should I do? And then I made the great discovery
[04:27.230 --> 04:29.190]  that my cables are long enough
[04:29.190 --> 04:31.490]  that they can reach my bed.
[04:31.930 --> 04:33.510]  Absolutely eight pillows.
[04:33.750 --> 04:34.710]  Maybe eight pillows.
[04:35.010 --> 04:37.070]  You need the back support for
[04:37.070 --> 04:39.170]  I'm sitting up on the back of the bed.
[04:39.170 --> 04:40.550]  You don't want to be lying on your back.
[04:40.770 --> 04:43.250]  No, that'd be weird. It'd be a strange podcast setup.
[04:44.110 --> 04:45.890]  So yeah, that's my life right now.
[04:46.030 --> 04:46.750]  Binoculars, though.
[04:46.870 --> 04:48.270]  Binoculars I wouldn't have gone for.
[04:48.890 --> 04:50.550]  Well, how else am I...
[04:50.550 --> 04:52.570]  I'm a near-sighted person, Gavin.
[04:52.690 --> 04:53.930]  I can't see the screen.
[04:54.230 --> 04:56.410]  I would have magnified windows
[04:56.410 --> 04:58.450]  probably before I would have found binoculars.
[04:58.850 --> 04:59.990]  Is that book next to you a bible?
[05:00.170 --> 05:01.630]  Because you prayed on it?
[05:01.790 --> 05:02.190]  No!
[05:03.850 --> 05:06.670]  I keep going to call you Jake. I'm so sorry, Geoff.
[05:06.790 --> 05:08.310]  That's okay. Very insulting.
[05:09.430 --> 05:10.650]  That's a joke book
[05:10.650 --> 05:12.390]  from 1940 that I bought.
[05:12.610 --> 05:14.390]  Is that where you found the Jake joke?
[05:14.750 --> 05:15.610]  Yeah, that is.
[05:15.830 --> 05:18.370]  All my greatest material comes from that
[05:18.370 --> 05:19.690]  1940 joke book.
[05:19.830 --> 05:22.330]  So if there's any dead air, any pause
[05:22.330 --> 05:24.090]  in the action, just let me know.
[05:24.090 --> 05:25.690]  I guess I'd be aware, but...
[05:25.690 --> 05:27.350]  You could find a morally questionable joke.
[05:27.530 --> 05:29.910]  Oh, there are some bangers in that book.
[05:31.510 --> 05:32.210]  Pick a...
[05:32.210 --> 05:34.110]  Here, let's do one. Pick a page
[05:34.110 --> 05:36.070]  one. Between one and
[05:36.070 --> 05:37.670]  like 900. 69.
[05:38.650 --> 05:39.570]  Okay, 69.
[05:39.850 --> 05:42.130]  I'm holding the book upside down. Good start.
[05:42.950 --> 05:44.190]  69. Okay, it looks
[05:44.190 --> 05:45.790]  like we are in...
[05:45.790 --> 05:46.710]  What is the chapter?
[05:47.570 --> 05:49.650]  The American Scene. Okay, now
[05:49.650 --> 05:51.490]  pick a number between 685
[05:51.490 --> 05:53.210]  and 695.
[05:54.570 --> 05:55.170]  691.
[05:56.290 --> 05:56.890]  691.
[05:57.510 --> 05:59.650]  Okay, I'm just going to read this and if it's problematic
[05:59.650 --> 06:01.490]  or racist in any way, we can
[06:01.490 --> 06:03.470]  edit it. A doctor who
[06:03.470 --> 06:05.510]  was called to a small country town
[06:05.510 --> 06:07.450]  to extract an appendix missed
[06:07.450 --> 06:09.370]  the last train back, stayed
[06:09.370 --> 06:11.130]  overnight in a miserable hotel,
[06:11.450 --> 06:13.270]  and was waited on at breakfast by a
[06:13.270 --> 06:14.330]  sallow and...
[06:14.330 --> 06:16.310]  Sallow? Salo? Sallow?
[06:16.710 --> 06:19.010]  And cadaver...
[06:19.010 --> 06:20.450]  Cadaver... Cadaverous?
[06:20.750 --> 06:22.310]  Sallow and cadaverous country girl.
[06:22.710 --> 06:25.050]  Said she. Boiled
[06:25.050 --> 06:26.850]  tongue, stewed kidneys, fried
[06:26.850 --> 06:28.170]  liver, said he.
[06:28.830 --> 06:30.830]  Hang your symptoms, bring
[06:30.830 --> 06:31.970]  me something to eat.
[06:33.430 --> 06:33.730]  I see.
[06:34.650 --> 06:36.590]  You need to work on the delivery, but yeah.
[06:36.870 --> 06:38.350]  Well, you know, I haven't read it before.
[06:38.750 --> 06:40.850]  She offered him essentially a bunch
[06:40.850 --> 06:42.730]  of Ofol and he took that as
[06:42.730 --> 06:44.830]  to be her symptoms of the... If you
[06:44.830 --> 06:46.750]  think it's a delivery issue, let me just do it again
[06:46.750 --> 06:48.650]  Is that how you pronounce awful?
[06:49.250 --> 06:50.870]  Is that how you say awful? Ofol?
[06:50.990 --> 06:52.370]  I don't know. I don't know how to say it.
[06:52.950 --> 06:54.670]  O-F-A-L
[06:55.110 --> 06:55.770]  O-F-F
[06:56.810 --> 06:58.410]  A-L? I don't know.
[06:59.270 --> 07:01.550]  It's one of those words I read, don't say it.
[07:01.550 --> 07:02.850]  Okay, here's another great joke.
[07:03.190 --> 07:04.830]  Quick one. I'll nail the
[07:04.830 --> 07:06.890]  delivery on this one. You picked the very
[07:06.890 --> 07:08.790]  wordy one. Someday we hope
[07:08.790 --> 07:10.770]  to see a waiter with enough of what it takes
[07:10.770 --> 07:12.630]  to lay the check face up on the table.
[07:13.550 --> 07:14.210]  Great joke.
[07:16.150 --> 07:17.190]  Nailed it.
[07:18.290 --> 07:20.330]  So I got a thousand pages of that
[07:20.330 --> 07:22.030]  if we ever need them. Well, we're set.
[07:22.290 --> 07:24.090]  We're covered. I'm no longer worried about
[07:24.090 --> 07:26.370]  dead ass. No! I got it.
[07:26.870 --> 07:28.170]  I will fumble
[07:28.170 --> 07:30.390]  my way through so many jokes.
[07:30.810 --> 07:32.090]  Hey, let's do one more
[07:32.090 --> 07:34.010]  in honor of your birthday. Let's do
[07:34.010 --> 07:36.370]  page 27. Page 27.
[07:36.550 --> 07:37.170]  Okay, Jesus.
[07:38.010 --> 07:40.370]  27. I really... I put the...
[07:40.370 --> 07:41.610]  We're still in the American scene.
[07:41.610 --> 07:43.030]  Which is very fitting for me.
[07:43.430 --> 07:45.550]  Jesus. We're gonna go with the shortest joke
[07:45.550 --> 07:47.690]  on this fucking thing because there's a bunch that are like
[07:47.690 --> 07:48.550]  a paragraph long.
[07:49.650 --> 07:51.070]  If I were you, Percy,
[07:51.350 --> 07:53.370]  I should tell him just what I think of him.
[07:53.790 --> 07:55.270]  Percy. How can I?
[07:56.310 --> 07:57.670]  I don't... I'm scared
[07:57.670 --> 07:59.290]  to say that. I don't know what that means.
[08:00.070 --> 08:00.890]  I don't know what that means.
[08:02.270 --> 08:03.090]  Another banger!
[08:03.710 --> 08:05.730]  I'm not gonna say it. I don't know what that means.
[08:06.050 --> 08:06.830]  That's dangerous.
[08:08.150 --> 08:09.070]  What's a cad?
[08:09.510 --> 08:10.990]  What's a cad? Like C-A-D?
[08:11.170 --> 08:11.830]  C-A-D.
[08:12.650 --> 08:14.270]  Just like a rapscallion.
[08:15.150 --> 08:16.270]  Like a cad.
[08:17.590 --> 08:19.030]  It's not bad. It's not racist
[08:19.030 --> 08:20.850]  or anything. Okay. Great.
[08:21.610 --> 08:23.170]  It was a cad. That was the word
[08:23.170 --> 08:25.150]  I was afraid to say. But that's my setup.
[08:25.510 --> 08:26.410]  And that's why I'm late.
[08:26.950 --> 08:28.970]  Because I didn't realize. I couldn't see that anyone
[08:28.970 --> 08:29.710]  had joined the call.
[08:30.910 --> 08:33.110]  Wait, was that the joke? Yeah, that was the
[08:33.110 --> 08:34.710]  joke. That was it. Great joke.
[08:35.110 --> 08:35.890]  What was the joke?
[08:35.890 --> 08:37.830]  What happened?
[08:38.530 --> 08:40.090]  I feel like I'm having a stroke.
[08:40.410 --> 08:41.850]  Did you spill something in the book?
[08:41.950 --> 08:43.010]  No, no, no.
[08:43.370 --> 08:45.650]  This is standard for these jokes.
[08:45.890 --> 08:47.810]  It's often you're left with wondering where
[08:47.810 --> 08:49.970]  the joke was. Sort of the magic
[08:49.970 --> 08:51.390]  of this book. Belle,
[08:51.570 --> 08:53.930]  if I were you, Percy, I should tell
[08:53.930 --> 08:55.130]  him just what I think of him.
[08:55.630 --> 08:57.990]  Percy, how can I? The cad has
[08:57.990 --> 08:59.750]  no telephone. That's the
[08:59.750 --> 09:01.950]  joke. I don't know if you missed part
[09:01.950 --> 09:03.910]  of it before. Oh, I thought it
[09:03.910 --> 09:05.530]  ended with just you saying the cad.
[09:05.970 --> 09:08.010]  No, that was the thing. I was scared to proceed
[09:08.010 --> 09:10.030]  past, and then I couldn't remember, I think,
[09:10.130 --> 09:11.950]  what followed that. So maybe it was
[09:11.950 --> 09:13.930]  my fault. Still,
[09:14.570 --> 09:15.230]  great joke.
[09:18.250 --> 09:19.550]  Happy birthday to me!
[09:20.390 --> 09:20.710]  Hey!
[09:21.930 --> 09:24.070]  So what are your goals for this
[09:24.070 --> 09:24.770]  year of your life?
[09:25.410 --> 09:27.750]  What a fucking...
[09:27.750 --> 09:29.650]  Who asked that on a birthday?
[09:30.090 --> 09:31.690]  That's a serious... That's a good point.
[09:31.690 --> 09:33.410]  You know what? My birthday present to you,
[09:33.590 --> 09:35.250]  I'm gonna un-ask that question.
[09:35.630 --> 09:37.130]  That's great. Happy birthday.
[09:37.570 --> 09:39.570]  Thank you. I texted you happy birthday, you didn't
[09:39.570 --> 09:41.670]  reply. No, because I was trying to assemble
[09:41.670 --> 09:43.610]  all this stuff. I apologize. I saw it,
[09:43.750 --> 09:45.710]  and I was like, I wanna get to this, but I need to... I mean, it doesn't
[09:45.710 --> 09:47.470]  need a response, I was just making sure you saw.
[09:47.730 --> 09:49.650]  Well, if it didn't need a response, why acknowledge
[09:49.650 --> 09:51.630]  the fact I didn't reply? You know what, as a birthday
[09:51.630 --> 09:53.770]  present, I'll take that comment back. Happy birthday.
[09:54.430 --> 09:54.850]  Thank you.
[09:57.110 --> 09:57.830]  You potentially
[09:57.830 --> 09:59.430]  cost people a lot of money, Gavin,
[09:59.430 --> 10:01.450]  by the way. I saw somebody
[10:01.450 --> 10:03.510]  comment that they followed your roulette call
[10:03.510 --> 10:05.470]  and they lost, so I'm curious how many people
[10:05.470 --> 10:07.550]  have copied that. Oh, come on, they can't
[10:08.170 --> 10:09.690]  win. Black can't
[10:09.690 --> 10:10.470]  lose forever.
[10:11.490 --> 10:13.130]  No, but the amount, like,
[10:13.190 --> 10:15.450]  I wonder how many people have done that and what
[10:15.450 --> 10:17.370]  the win percentage is. I bet
[10:17.370 --> 10:19.030]  it's astronomically low.
[10:20.750 --> 10:21.490]  No, you gotta be with me
[10:21.490 --> 10:22.990]  in person. I think that's how it works.
[10:23.250 --> 10:25.490]  Okay. We'll test that one day.
[10:25.610 --> 10:27.490]  I can't wait to lose everything in front
[10:27.490 --> 10:29.390]  of you and then see what you have to say about it.
[10:29.690 --> 10:31.530]  I feel like you would rather lose just so
[10:31.530 --> 10:33.330]  I have to come up with a reason.
[10:33.450 --> 10:34.190]  Oh, absolutely.
[10:35.490 --> 10:37.450]  You know I'd feel bad and be uncomfortable.
[10:37.970 --> 10:38.650]  Yeah, totally.
[10:39.110 --> 10:41.570]  That would be the dream. You guys will be happy
[10:41.570 --> 10:43.330]  to know that I purchased
[10:43.330 --> 10:45.270]  this morning a tiny
[10:45.270 --> 10:47.430]  roulette wheel, like a
[10:47.430 --> 10:49.310]  Fisher Price roulette wheel, set up
[10:49.310 --> 10:51.450]  for the F*** Face Breaks show, so that
[10:51.450 --> 10:53.430]  we can test out these roulette theories.
[10:54.070 --> 10:55.370]  It's already in the mail
[10:55.370 --> 10:55.830]  on the way.
[10:57.650 --> 10:59.450]  I even told Gavin about it last night
[10:59.450 --> 11:01.570]  and then I remembered that I hadn't bought it yet, so I bought it this morning
[11:01.570 --> 11:02.970]  when I woke up. That's amazing.
[11:03.290 --> 11:05.270]  I woke up this morning and I was
[11:05.270 --> 11:06.930]  struggling to remember if something
[11:07.470 --> 11:09.430]  if a conversation I had was a dream or not.
[11:09.810 --> 11:11.410]  Andrew, did we have a conversation recently
[11:11.410 --> 11:12.950]  that ended up with you saying
[11:13.730 --> 11:15.530]  AAA batteries are a non-standard
[11:15.530 --> 11:17.070]  size? Uh, I just
[11:17.070 --> 11:19.310]  yeah. Well, I was saying that
[11:19.310 --> 11:21.350]  that they're a rarer battery than
[11:21.350 --> 11:23.130]  a AA. I think that was on the podcast,
[11:23.130 --> 11:25.090]  wasn't it? Uh, it was either
[11:25.090 --> 11:26.850]  on the podcast or after.
[11:27.330 --> 11:28.730]  Oh, okay. I just
[11:29.210 --> 11:31.190]  feel like that's pretty standard. Like, if
[11:31.190 --> 11:33.130]  you're in a place that sells AA, you've probably got
[11:33.130 --> 11:34.590]  AAA not far. Absolutely.
[11:35.070 --> 11:36.510]  It's not like an E-battery or something.
[11:36.890 --> 11:39.110]  I completely agree with that. My point was more in the
[11:39.110 --> 11:41.110]  house. I don't feel like... I feel like it's more likely
[11:41.110 --> 11:43.010]  people have double A's. Like, that's...
[11:43.010 --> 11:45.310]  if you're gonna have batteries at your house, you're gonna have double A's.
[11:45.770 --> 11:47.150]  In my experience. There are
[11:47.150 --> 11:49.170]  more pieces of equipment on Earth
[11:49.170 --> 11:50.910]  that require AA than AAA, probably.
[11:51.370 --> 11:52.890]  Absolutely. That was my point.
[11:53.010 --> 11:54.890]  Not that, like, you fuckin' had to go
[11:54.890 --> 11:56.830]  on a treasure hunt to find a AAA battery.
[11:56.930 --> 11:59.010]  Just that they weren't as
[11:59.010 --> 12:00.530]  popular of a usage
[12:00.530 --> 12:02.930]  as opposed to the double A. The king
[12:02.930 --> 12:04.750]  of batteries, I'd say. I
[12:04.750 --> 12:06.610]  also... just before we get too far
[12:06.610 --> 12:08.890]  from this, I need to make a sincere...
[12:08.890 --> 12:10.810]  From what? From the beginning
[12:10.810 --> 12:13.010]  of the show. I have an order. Honestly,
[12:13.150 --> 12:14.850]  that statement only makes sense because of my
[12:14.850 --> 12:17.090]  notes. I have this note at the beginning.
[12:17.450 --> 12:19.150]  I can't expand
[12:19.150 --> 12:21.070]  too far past it. I need to make a
[12:21.070 --> 12:22.950]  sincere apology to you, Geoff.
[12:23.990 --> 12:25.350]  Also, fuck both
[12:25.350 --> 12:27.130]  of you, but also apology.
[12:27.650 --> 12:28.510]  Okay, so what's the order?
[12:29.130 --> 12:31.550]  I'm going to first say...
[12:31.550 --> 12:33.330]  Nah, I don't need to. I'm gonna, like you,
[12:33.710 --> 12:35.310]  my kindness, my birthday
[12:35.310 --> 12:37.270]  gift back. My advanced
[12:37.270 --> 12:39.030]  birthday gift is retracting that statement.
[12:39.370 --> 12:41.330]  Just an apology to Geoff. Last week
[12:41.330 --> 12:42.830]  when we recorded,
[12:43.190 --> 12:45.250]  you had an issue with
[12:45.250 --> 12:46.870]  the comment leavers. They were like,
[12:46.870 --> 12:49.090]  ah, people criticizing
[12:49.090 --> 12:50.790]  putting tot in the
[12:50.790 --> 12:52.550]  recipe. That's unfair.
[12:53.090 --> 12:54.690]  You wanted a clarification of that.
[12:55.290 --> 12:56.990]  Yeah. I was listening to it,
[12:57.050 --> 12:57.690]  I was like, whatever.
[12:58.710 --> 13:00.890]  It's sort of a strange thing to care about
[13:00.890 --> 13:02.890]  them doing that. There are so many
[13:02.890 --> 13:04.810]  fucking people that think they
[13:04.810 --> 13:06.790]  understand how ramen works. They got no
[13:06.790 --> 13:08.670]  fucking idea. I'm so
[13:08.670 --> 13:10.650]  sick of this. I'm so
[13:10.650 --> 13:12.930]  sick of these. Why didn't he
[13:12.930 --> 13:15.010]  read the instructions? I'm the
[13:15.010 --> 13:17.150]  biggest fucking instruction guy
[13:17.150 --> 13:18.450]  on this podcast.
[13:18.670 --> 13:20.650]  I love instructions.
[13:21.010 --> 13:22.630]  I follow them to a T.
[13:22.930 --> 13:25.190]  I look at all the instructions always.
[13:25.410 --> 13:27.050]  People are just coming out, left
[13:27.050 --> 13:29.110]  and right. Why didn't he read the
[13:29.110 --> 13:30.650]  instructions? You
[13:30.650 --> 13:33.130]  fucking idiots. I did
[13:33.130 --> 13:34.230]  read the instructions.
[13:34.750 --> 13:36.410]  I dug up the instructions.
[13:36.870 --> 13:38.250]  I'm gonna post them in the chat.
[13:38.790 --> 13:40.630]  Gotta use my binoculars. One second.
[13:42.370 --> 13:43.010]  Okay.
[13:43.010 --> 13:44.110]  Okay.
[13:44.870 --> 13:46.110]  He's bird watching.
[13:46.510 --> 13:47.450]  I got it.
[13:49.030 --> 13:51.150]  There's the recipe. Put the noodle and condiments
[13:51.150 --> 13:52.470]  in the bowl. Pour
[13:53.010 --> 13:55.050]  one and a half cups of boiling
[13:55.050 --> 13:56.370]  water. Cover the bowl for three minutes.
[13:56.670 --> 13:59.070]  That's how you would cook the pot.
[13:59.070 --> 14:00.330]  That's the package ramen.
[14:00.950 --> 14:03.050]  That's for package ramen. Where does it
[14:03.050 --> 14:04.650]  say put the ramen in the fucking pot?
[14:05.050 --> 14:06.250]  It says the opposite.
[14:06.710 --> 14:08.050]  That's not ramen then.
[14:08.450 --> 14:10.150]  That's like a special type.
[14:10.150 --> 14:12.210]  No, it's not. I went to the store
[14:12.210 --> 14:13.450]  and bought ramen in a bag.
[14:13.870 --> 14:16.310]  What do you want from me? Post a picture of the ramen.
[14:16.790 --> 14:18.030]  Okay. Give me the whole packet.
[14:18.270 --> 14:20.230]  Well, fucking, I didn't expect this
[14:20.230 --> 14:22.470]  question. I gotta get the goddamn binoculars
[14:22.470 --> 14:23.970]  out. We're going to another tab.
[14:24.210 --> 14:26.150]  I think that's like a...
[14:32.220 --> 14:34.540]  We find this. Goddamn motherfucker.
[14:34.980 --> 14:35.840]  This isn't ramen.
[14:37.160 --> 14:37.620]  Binoculars.
[14:38.360 --> 14:40.040]  I retract my previous
[14:40.700 --> 14:42.180]  statement. Fuck you.
[14:42.680 --> 14:43.460]  I am.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.480]  I'm short-sighted, Gavin.
[14:46.100 --> 14:48.020]  I get the fact that you can't see your monitor
[14:48.020 --> 14:50.380]  from across the room. There are easier
[14:50.380 --> 14:52.140]  ways. I don't know how.
[14:52.260 --> 14:52.960]  Get a packet of ramen.
[14:54.560 --> 14:55.920]  Here's the thing. Someone sent
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.940]  ramen instructions that showed that
[14:57.940 --> 14:59.180]  and that's fair.
[14:59.680 --> 15:01.900]  I get it. But don't act like I don't
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.920]  fucking read the instructions. I read the instructions.
[15:05.780 --> 15:08.080]  I don't think you follow instructions to a tea.
[15:08.240 --> 15:10.080]  I think you follow them to a tea kettle.
[15:10.820 --> 15:11.340]  Wow.
[15:11.580 --> 15:13.260]  I see what you did there.
[15:13.800 --> 15:15.680]  Do you also own a 1940 joke book?
[15:16.520 --> 15:17.620]  Put that in the book.
[15:17.800 --> 15:20.120]  Page 1000. What I was going to say before Gavin
[15:20.120 --> 15:22.040]  dumped that on us is
[15:23.240 --> 15:24.280]  apology accepted,
[15:24.460 --> 15:26.380]  Andrew. Apology accepted.
[15:26.780 --> 15:28.080]  The comment leavers can be
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.800]  frustrated when they misconstrue things.
[15:29.880 --> 15:32.000]  I understand. And I want you to know
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.060]  you got my support, buddy, as always.
[15:34.600 --> 15:35.320]  I just...
[15:36.340 --> 15:38.080]  Love them. Appreciate
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.820]  the comment leavers a lot.
[15:40.640 --> 15:42.320]  Wait, is there a difference between
[15:42.320 --> 15:44.300]  short... I got the binoculars still up.
[15:44.500 --> 15:46.060]  Short-sighted, near-sighted, they're the same,
[15:46.120 --> 15:47.900]  aren't they? Just different phrasings?
[15:48.120 --> 15:49.160]  They sound like they're the opposite.
[15:50.040 --> 15:52.220]  I think short-sighted has nothing to do
[15:52.220 --> 15:53.820]  with your vision, dude.
[15:54.920 --> 15:56.140]  I think near-sighted does
[15:56.140 --> 15:58.020]  or far-sighted. I think short-sighted means
[15:58.020 --> 15:58.540]  you can't see.
[16:00.260 --> 16:02.040]  You can't envision things
[16:02.040 --> 16:03.540]  happening far out into the future.
[16:04.180 --> 16:06.080]  Honestly, that was a dilemma
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.940]  before when I was thinking about it. I was like, I'm aware
[16:07.940 --> 16:10.000]  of that definition, but I couldn't think of anything else
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.080]  to describe. I would definitely
[16:12.080 --> 16:13.800]  say you're short-sighted. Yeah.
[16:14.260 --> 16:15.900]  Yeah, that's actually correct.
[16:16.480 --> 16:17.700]  Is this ramen, Gavin?
[16:18.620 --> 16:19.980]  Is this fuckin' ramen?
[16:20.140 --> 16:22.200]  Is this appropriate? Does this check out
[16:22.200 --> 16:24.120]  for you? Is that fuckin' ramen?
[16:24.260 --> 16:25.360]  Is that ramen-y enough?
[16:25.840 --> 16:27.940]  It looks like ramen. It looks pretty ramen-y.
[16:28.120 --> 16:29.460]  It's very ramen-y.
[16:30.160 --> 16:31.940]  I went to the grocery store, I bought it,
[16:31.960 --> 16:33.000]  I followed the instructions.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.820]  Oh, so, okay.
[16:35.340 --> 16:36.540]  That's all I wanted to say.
[16:36.900 --> 16:39.260]  Apology to Geoff, and also people have no fuckin' idea
[16:39.260 --> 16:41.220]  that there are other ways to make
[16:41.220 --> 16:42.940]  ramen. I'm following the instructions.
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.180]  Don't be mad at me, be mad at Mama.
[16:45.400 --> 16:47.100]  Be mad at the Mama company if you're
[16:47.100 --> 16:48.080]  gonna be mad at somebody.
[16:48.500 --> 16:51.020]  While we're issuing statements,
[16:51.660 --> 16:52.940]  I would like to jump in,
[16:52.980 --> 16:54.900]  just because I don't think Gavin or, maybe
[16:54.900 --> 16:56.480]  Gavin was here for it, but Andrew definitely wasn't.
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.660]  We discovered right before the show started
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.940]  that I'm not, listen, alright,
[17:00.940 --> 17:03.100]  I'm stupid, a lot, but I'm not
[17:03.100 --> 17:04.980]  totally stupid when it comes
[17:04.980 --> 17:06.980]  to playing shit into my phone, like
[17:06.980 --> 17:08.840]  when Jack called, playing shit into the microphone,
[17:09.020 --> 17:10.980]  we found out today that I had
[17:10.980 --> 17:12.900]  something called noise suppression selected
[17:12.900 --> 17:15.000]  which wouldn't let any of anything be
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.960]  heard. And then we fixed it, and now I
[17:16.960 --> 17:18.980]  can play stuff to you guys. That's exciting.
[17:19.420 --> 17:20.920]  So it's not that I don't know where
[17:20.920 --> 17:23.020]  the microphone on my phone is when I hold
[17:23.020 --> 17:24.940]  it up to the microphone, when I hold it up to
[17:24.940 --> 17:26.960]  the microphone to record, I know where the microphone on my
[17:26.960 --> 17:28.900]  phone is, it's just that noise suppression was
[17:28.900 --> 17:30.280]  cancelling it out. Speaker, whatever,
[17:30.960 --> 17:32.840]  let's just do that again. It's not that I
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.600]  don't know where the speaker is on my phone,
[17:34.760 --> 17:36.880]  I know exactly where it is, and when I put it up to the thing,
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.800]  I don't know why it doesn't play for you guys, but now
[17:38.800 --> 17:40.860]  it will. Because we tested it, and it worked.
[17:41.260 --> 17:42.960]  Am I smart enough already having it
[17:42.960 --> 17:44.520]  off? Yes. Okay.
[17:44.920 --> 17:46.820]  But your intelligence was never in question.
[17:50.740 --> 17:52.800]  What's weird is I never viewed it as
[17:52.800 --> 17:54.980]  like you, I don't know, it wasn't
[17:54.980 --> 17:56.900]  a dumb thing? This is gonna sound strange.
[17:56.900 --> 17:58.920]  Really? Because I'm pretty sure it was
[17:58.920 --> 18:00.000]  with Nick and Eric today.
[18:01.120 --> 18:03.000]  I viewed it, and maybe this is
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.040]  the same, I just viewed it as you didn't
[18:05.040 --> 18:06.860]  know how, which is maybe more insulting.
[18:07.420 --> 18:08.880]  I don't know what is more insulting, but
[18:08.880 --> 18:10.980]  it just seemed like a thing, you were just bad at it.
[18:11.120 --> 18:12.100]  It was like, somehow it was skilling you right away.
[18:12.100 --> 18:14.860]  I'm not though, it was just a setting. And we
[18:14.860 --> 18:16.200]  fixed it! Thanks to Nick.
[18:16.780 --> 18:18.340]  Yay! Good job, Nick.
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.060]  We did it. What a time.
[18:20.860 --> 18:22.500]  Well, Andrew, is there any,
[18:22.580 --> 18:24.780]  this is your birthday, man, it's not even like
[18:24.780 --> 18:26.680]  your birthday episode, today is straight up
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.720]  your birthday, so is there anything else you wanna
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.080]  talk about? Do you wanna, like,
[18:30.540 --> 18:31.880]  this is your podcast today.
[18:32.220 --> 18:34.500]  Well, it's our podcast, as you've said before,
[18:34.580 --> 18:36.200]  it's a triangle. Not my podcast.
[18:36.660 --> 18:37.680]  We're a comedic triangle.
[18:37.980 --> 18:40.860]  I have a thing to share with you
[18:40.860 --> 18:42.500]  guys, I mean, I have two things to talk about.
[18:42.620 --> 18:44.500]  One, you're aware of, the other one,
[18:45.120 --> 18:46.120]  I discovered this.
[18:46.820 --> 18:48.680]  Don Zimmer has multiple fights. Now, this
[18:48.680 --> 18:49.960]  isn't a physical fight.
[18:50.420 --> 18:52.780]  It's not physical, but Don Zimmer
[18:53.300 --> 18:54.660]  has one of the greatest
[18:54.660 --> 18:56.160]  umpire fights I've ever seen.
[18:56.640 --> 18:58.720]  Is this a video? It's a video.
[18:58.820 --> 19:00.740]  I'm gonna post it in the thing. Go to, like, a minute
[19:00.740 --> 19:02.400]  forty for this thing.
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.260]  I'll be right back. Just a second. Sorry.
[19:04.760 --> 19:04.960]  Okay.
[19:08.260 --> 19:08.700]  Okay.
[19:10.920 --> 19:12.360]  Binoculars. Here we go.
[19:13.200 --> 19:13.580]  Faced.
[19:15.800 --> 19:16.920]  You're dropping it in.
[19:18.620 --> 19:20.640]  Okay, one minute forty. 1989.
[19:20.640 --> 19:21.000]  1989.
[19:22.680 --> 19:24.400]  Let's go to, like, a minute forty.
[19:24.500 --> 19:26.780]  I was still shitting myself.
[19:27.380 --> 19:28.240]  I didn't exist yet.
[19:29.380 --> 19:30.460]  I'm so sorry about that.
[19:30.840 --> 19:32.720]  Andrew, that was the delivery guy.
[19:32.860 --> 19:34.440]  Your birthday stuff is there. Can you go out
[19:34.440 --> 19:36.060]  for front and meet him? I don't know.
[19:36.500 --> 19:38.760]  What do you mean? I sent you some birthday stuff.
[19:38.980 --> 19:40.700]  He's gonna have to climb out of his recording
[19:40.700 --> 19:42.340]  pod. Well, I don't know. The guy said he
[19:42.920 --> 19:44.700]  rang the bell. Nobody answered.
[19:45.200 --> 19:46.760]  This. You did.
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.200]  Fuck. This is. Okay.
[19:48.200 --> 19:50.220]  I'm gonna have to run around my building because he's probably
[19:50.220 --> 19:51.880]  not at my door. I don't know.
[19:52.800 --> 19:54.280]  You won't tell us how to get to
[19:54.280 --> 19:54.620]  your house.
[19:56.020 --> 19:58.080]  We've done a million of these and it's a
[19:58.080 --> 20:00.180]  staple that my door. God damn it.
[20:00.300 --> 20:02.360]  Why don't you just use your binoculars? See if you can see him.
[20:03.360 --> 20:04.080]  God damn.
[20:04.340 --> 20:04.760]  Son of a.
[20:07.660 --> 20:08.340]  He hates
[20:08.340 --> 20:10.220]  getting up. He hates switching rooms
[20:10.220 --> 20:12.280]  and switching floors. You're really making him
[20:12.280 --> 20:12.620]  work.
[20:14.460 --> 20:16.260]  I'm so sorry. I sent him
[20:16.260 --> 20:18.360]  some nice shit. Hearing him walk
[20:18.360 --> 20:18.880]  away going,
[20:19.080 --> 20:22.580]  as he leaves the room
[20:22.580 --> 20:23.400]  is really something.
[20:24.400 --> 20:25.940]  Now, this would have been perfect
[20:25.940 --> 20:28.280]  if 10 minutes later you had ordered him
[20:28.280 --> 20:30.280]  something, Gavin, and then 10 minutes later you had ordered
[20:30.280 --> 20:32.200]  him something, Eric. So every 15 minutes, he's
[20:32.200 --> 20:33.300]  gotta get out of bed.
[20:34.260 --> 20:36.160]  Get out of bed. Can't you
[20:36.160 --> 20:37.260]  just order another one right now?
[20:37.780 --> 20:38.920]  Yeah, maybe. Let's see.
[20:39.820 --> 20:41.160]  Make me do all the work. Okay.
[20:41.680 --> 20:43.300]  Well, I mean, you got all the address and all that.
[20:43.300 --> 20:44.580]  I got it from you!
[20:46.100 --> 20:47.400]  I had to ask you for
[20:47.400 --> 20:48.360]  his address today.
[20:50.440 --> 20:51.520]  I don't know. Do I need
[20:51.520 --> 20:53.120]  like a Canadian account or something?
[20:53.380 --> 20:55.360]  No, dude! I didn't even have Postmates
[20:55.360 --> 20:57.580]  until this. I downloaded it
[20:57.580 --> 20:59.000]  after you gave me the address.
[20:59.400 --> 21:01.480]  Oh, man. I can't
[21:01.480 --> 21:03.280]  until this fucking... Let's see.
[21:03.520 --> 21:05.480]  Can I do another action order? Oh, yeah. He should have
[21:05.480 --> 21:06.600]  joined on his phone.
[21:07.040 --> 21:08.160]  So we could hear him.
[21:09.480 --> 21:11.500]  Join on phone.
[21:12.560 --> 21:13.660]  He's gonna come back
[21:13.660 --> 21:15.540]  and you have to use his binoculars to see us
[21:15.540 --> 21:17.740]  yelling join on phone a bunch
[21:17.740 --> 21:19.700]  of times. I bet he didn't take his phone
[21:19.700 --> 21:21.520]  with him, did he? Oh, shit. What if he locked
[21:21.520 --> 21:23.780]  himself out or something? Should we get him a bar burrito
[21:23.780 --> 21:25.560]  or a waterfront confection?
[21:25.880 --> 21:27.400]  Waterfront confection.
[21:28.100 --> 21:29.160]  Let's do that.
[21:30.240 --> 21:31.700]  Sugar-free dark chocolate
[21:31.700 --> 21:33.820]  ice cream. Yes, please. We'll do...
[21:33.820 --> 21:35.680]  Fuck it. Let's do a whole liter. Why not?
[21:35.720 --> 21:36.120]  That's a good idea.
[21:36.960 --> 21:39.180]  I don't know how much that is, but I assume it's a lot.
[21:39.700 --> 21:40.880]  Banana chocolate chunk.
[21:41.300 --> 21:42.740]  I'll do a half liter of that.
[21:43.700 --> 21:44.940]  And... ooh, blue bubblegum.
[21:45.060 --> 21:46.840]  Let's get him a half liter of blue bubblegum.
[21:48.220 --> 21:49.040]  And... what else
[21:49.040 --> 21:51.100]  do we got? Everything in his island is vegan, by the way.
[21:51.320 --> 21:53.080]  Vegan and gluten-free. Oh, yeah, they have
[21:53.080 --> 21:55.220]  birthday cake flavor? Ooh, let's see. That's a great one.
[21:55.280 --> 21:57.140]  They have New York cheesecake, they have green pistachio,
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.280]  they have pomegranate, they have
[21:59.360 --> 22:00.980]  Nanaimo bar, root beer,
[22:01.140 --> 22:02.900]  rum raisin. Fucking rum raisin.
[22:02.940 --> 22:04.980]  What year is this? Ooh, cookie dough!
[22:05.100 --> 22:06.740]  Everybody loves cookie dough. There you go, cookie dough.
[22:06.740 --> 22:07.940]  Half liter of cookie dough.
[22:08.460 --> 22:11.000]  That is $70 of Canadian ice cream.
[22:11.080 --> 22:12.280]  Okay, we'll do that.
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.460]  Okay, I hope he likes his ice cream.
[22:14.940 --> 22:16.740]  He'll love it. Should we call him?
[22:17.200 --> 22:18.880]  Let's phone him. Well, I know, I just
[22:18.880 --> 22:20.500]  got the notification that he picked up the stuff.
[22:20.780 --> 22:23.180]  Oh, then he'll be back up in just a second. He'll be back any second now.
[22:23.440 --> 22:24.800]  And now they're preparing my other
[22:24.800 --> 22:26.780]  order. The latest... okay, okay, so the
[22:26.780 --> 22:28.600]  latest arrival will be by 3.10pm.
[22:29.180 --> 22:30.860]  So let's just make sure we keep this going
[22:30.860 --> 22:32.940]  that long. Okay. Yeah. Well, we have to.
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.840]  Yeah, for sure. He's gonna be
[22:34.840 --> 22:36.760]  very annoyed by the next one.
[22:37.180 --> 22:39.080]  Yeah. I think that's the plan, Gavin.
[22:39.660 --> 22:40.900]  No, I'm saying it's definitely
[22:40.900 --> 22:43.000]  gonna work, based on his reaction to the first one.
[22:43.160 --> 22:44.000]  I'm not doubting it.
[22:45.400 --> 22:46.960]  I'm excited to hear him
[22:46.960 --> 22:48.620]  from a distance come back into the room.
[22:49.240 --> 22:49.480]  Yeah.
[22:56.600 --> 22:58.000]  I don't know about you, but I
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.280]  shop online pretty much
[23:00.280 --> 23:01.220]  every day.
[23:01.660 --> 23:04.100]  I don't know if that means I have a problem
[23:04.100 --> 23:06.020]  or society has
[23:06.020 --> 23:08.100]  the problem, but either way, we're all
[23:08.100 --> 23:09.900]  doing it, we're all shopping online,
[23:10.140 --> 23:12.220]  and we've all seen that promo code
[23:12.220 --> 23:14.200]  field taunt us at checkout, saying
[23:14.200 --> 23:16.140]  not only letting you know, hey, by the
[23:16.140 --> 23:18.140]  way, you don't have
[23:18.140 --> 23:20.500]  the in with this organization
[23:20.500 --> 23:21.800]  to get a discount,
[23:22.100 --> 23:24.200]  but we want you to know that discount exists
[23:24.200 --> 23:26.120]  and there are a lot of other people out there
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.540]  that they do get that discount.
[23:27.960 --> 23:30.180]  Just not you. Why not make it
[23:30.180 --> 23:32.240]  you? Finally, thanks to Honey,
[23:32.620 --> 23:34.500]  manually searching for coupon codes
[23:34.500 --> 23:36.080]  or not being popular enough to
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.940]  have one is a thing of the past
[23:37.940 --> 23:39.880]  because Honey is the free shopping tool
[23:39.880 --> 23:42.100]  that scours the internet for promo codes
[23:42.100 --> 23:44.260]  and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[23:44.620 --> 23:46.120]  Honey supports over 30,000
[23:46.120 --> 23:48.120]  stores online. They range from sites
[23:48.120 --> 23:50.140]  that have tech and gaming products to popular
[23:50.140 --> 23:52.080]  fashion brands. We all know how much
[23:52.080 --> 23:53.860]  I love my popular fashion brands
[23:53.860 --> 23:56.000]  and even food delivery. Mmm.
[23:56.440 --> 23:57.880]  That's the stuff you eat. I've
[23:57.880 --> 24:00.080]  talked about it a few times before, but it's
[24:00.080 --> 24:02.220]  a classic, so why don't we revisit
[24:02.220 --> 24:04.140]  the time that my girlfriend and I decided
[24:04.140 --> 24:06.000]  we wanted to buy stand-up paddle boards
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.180]  and I went to buy one online and she said
[24:08.180 --> 24:10.080]  wait, let's use Honey. And I said
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.860]  okay, let's do that.
[24:12.140 --> 24:14.380]  And we did and we saved like 15
[24:14.380 --> 24:16.160]  or 20. I can't remember how much now, but
[24:16.160 --> 24:17.840]  we saved a bunch of money and I was like, oh!
[24:18.120 --> 24:20.080]  That was good thinking. If you don't already have Honey
[24:20.080 --> 24:22.180]  you could be straight up missing out
[24:22.180 --> 24:24.020]  on free savings. It's literally
[24:24.020 --> 24:26.180]  free and it installs in a few
[24:26.180 --> 24:28.180]  seconds. And by getting it, you'll
[24:28.180 --> 24:30.060]  be doing yourself a solid and supporting
[24:30.060 --> 24:32.160]  this podcast. I'd never recommend
[24:32.160 --> 24:34.300]  something I don't use, so get Honey
[24:34.300 --> 24:36.900]  for free at joinhoney.com
[24:36.900 --> 24:38.040]  slash face.
[24:38.260 --> 24:40.180]  That's joinhoney.com
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.540]  slash face.
[24:43.700 --> 24:44.360]  I'm so
[24:44.360 --> 24:45.780]  excited for the next one.
[24:46.120 --> 24:47.700]  The 310.
[24:48.120 --> 24:48.900]  It's gonna be perfect.
[24:50.320 --> 24:52.820]  Thrilled. Half an hour from now.
[24:53.360 --> 24:54.220]  Oh wait, no,
[24:54.280 --> 24:55.520]  isn't that two hours from now?
[24:57.480 --> 24:58.140]  Isn't it
[24:58.140 --> 25:00.300]  two hours? Oh shit, it is two hours.
[25:00.300 --> 25:02.260]  It is. I wouldn't take
[25:02.260 --> 25:04.520]  that long. I said it was gonna be 30 to 45 minutes.
[25:06.500 --> 25:08.100]  Well, let's see. I can
[25:08.100 --> 25:09.480]  try. Let's just
[25:09.480 --> 25:10.760]  see what happens.
[25:11.840 --> 25:13.720]  Well, it listed as 225
[25:14.120 --> 25:16.240]  and says latest arrival by 310.
[25:16.720 --> 25:18.200]  Okay. 225,
[25:18.260 --> 25:20.220]  so that would be... what time
[25:20.220 --> 25:20.600]  is it?
[25:21.120 --> 25:24.760]  It should be 141.
[25:25.220 --> 25:26.360]  But according to this,
[25:26.480 --> 25:28.140]  I placed the order at 225.
[25:28.140 --> 25:30.060]  This country's too wide.
[25:31.960 --> 25:33.620]  Yeah, we should do something about that.
[25:33.620 --> 25:35.200]  We're not in our country at all right now.
[25:35.580 --> 25:38.420]  It shares the width.
[25:40.980 --> 25:42.280]  This country's too
[25:42.280 --> 25:44.080]  wide. It shares
[25:44.080 --> 25:44.940]  the width.
[25:48.940 --> 25:49.900]  Oh Christ.
[25:50.380 --> 25:51.760]  Does it have the same number of time zones?
[25:52.260 --> 25:53.900]  I don't know. Does Canada have
[25:53.900 --> 25:56.520]  mountain time? Canada time zones.
[25:56.520 --> 25:58.300]  There's six time zones in Canada.
[25:58.600 --> 26:00.460]  Apparently. They probably got one on
[26:01.280 --> 26:02.640]  Nova Scotia or something.
[26:03.100 --> 26:04.620]  It says central standard
[26:04.620 --> 26:06.620]  time in Canada. It's 242pm
[26:06.620 --> 26:08.440]  right now. Yeah, but he's not central.
[26:08.900 --> 26:10.420]  Where's central daylight
[26:10.420 --> 26:12.380]  time? He's like way west.
[26:12.580 --> 26:13.640]  No, I think he is though.
[26:14.220 --> 26:16.920]  Well, it does say Vancouver. It's 142.
[26:17.260 --> 26:19.460]  But it also says
[26:19.460 --> 26:20.860]  mountain daylight time
[26:20.860 --> 26:22.520]  and central standard time are both
[26:22.520 --> 26:24.180]  242. And then
[26:24.180 --> 26:26.120]  central daylight time is
[26:26.120 --> 26:27.620]  342. This is stupid.
[26:29.340 --> 26:30.140]  How are you going to have
[26:30.140 --> 26:32.180]  two different time zones that are the same fucking time?
[26:34.320 --> 26:36.220]  Why are they two different time zones
[26:36.220 --> 26:37.760]  then? That's so dumb.
[26:38.080 --> 26:39.820]  Well, they could be different depending on time of year.
[26:40.220 --> 26:42.020]  Like daylight savings. Yeah, I guess.
[26:42.340 --> 26:43.920]  How far away is his outside?
[26:44.360 --> 26:46.460]  This is crazy. I'm back.
[26:47.080 --> 26:47.360]  Oh.
[26:47.920 --> 26:49.880]  We were just bitching about time zones. How you doing buddy?
[26:50.120 --> 26:52.260]  Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
[26:53.360 --> 26:54.280]  Did you get
[26:54.280 --> 26:56.320]  your stuff? I got the bag, yeah.
[26:56.800 --> 26:58.360]  Oh, sweet. I tried to get you
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.320]  a birthday cake, but I couldn't find anybody that had a cake
[27:00.320 --> 27:02.240]  that could deliver it this quickly. So I just got you
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.260]  an assortment of things. You were gone for like
[27:04.260 --> 27:05.560]  10 minutes. Yeah.
[27:05.860 --> 27:08.360]  I had to go around the building. I had to find the guy.
[27:09.160 --> 27:10.520]  I was on my bare feet.
[27:10.620 --> 27:12.320]  I was making sure not to step on anything.
[27:13.740 --> 27:15.220]  This is a whole...
[27:15.220 --> 27:16.260]  I had to get
[27:16.260 --> 27:18.000]  out of the fucking wire nest
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.180]  that I assembled not thinking I'd move.
[27:21.840 --> 27:22.280]  Oh,
[27:22.400 --> 27:24.120]  I got a... what is this?
[27:24.520 --> 27:26.300]  Hey, Andrew. Thank you.
[27:26.520 --> 27:28.100]  Andrew, what time zone are you in?
[27:28.440 --> 27:29.880]  I'm in Pacific Standard Time.
[27:30.180 --> 27:32.200]  I believe. BST? That's not even
[27:32.200 --> 27:34.140]  listed. Pacific Daylight Time you mean?
[27:34.660 --> 27:36.140]  Pacific Standard Time is also a thing.
[27:36.480 --> 27:38.200]  I'm sure. Okay. What's it called
[27:38.200 --> 27:40.320]  in Canada? I believe Pacific Standard
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.140]  Time. Oh.
[27:41.940 --> 27:44.100]  Am I missing something? What's fucking going on?
[27:44.120 --> 27:46.000]  I feel like I left you guys laid out a bunch of
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.020]  goddamn booby traps and I'm coming back. It's my
[27:48.020 --> 27:49.940]  birthday. What is happening?
[27:51.040 --> 27:52.180]  I think the difference
[27:52.180 --> 27:54.060]  is Pacific Standard Time is
[27:54.060 --> 27:55.960]  a certain time of the year and then when you
[27:55.960 --> 27:58.020]  leap forward or leap back it switches to Pacific
[27:58.020 --> 28:00.040]  Daylight Time. I think it depends on the time of the year
[28:00.040 --> 28:01.960]  whether it's daylight or standard. I think. I think.
[28:02.300 --> 28:04.160]  That's stupid. Is there...
[28:04.160 --> 28:05.920]  I'm gonna find out. What is the
[28:07.060 --> 28:07.980]  difference... Okay, Andrew, do you
[28:07.980 --> 28:09.980]  wanna cover what you wanted to talk
[28:09.980 --> 28:12.080]  about today? Well, first
[28:12.080 --> 28:14.000]  we need to watch this video. We need to
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.260]  watch the Don Zimmer fight.
[28:15.260 --> 28:17.640]  What is this? Coffee? What is this?
[28:17.920 --> 28:19.400]  Did you say it was 1.40 in this video?
[28:19.540 --> 28:21.420]  Oh, I got you an Earl Grey
[28:21.420 --> 28:23.440]  tea. A warm tea just
[28:23.440 --> 28:25.340]  in case you got thirsty. Why is this wet?
[28:26.300 --> 28:27.380]  I don't feel like this
[28:27.380 --> 28:29.440]  is supposed to be wet. Yeah, okay.
[28:29.640 --> 28:31.460]  Sorry, let me... binoculars back out.
[28:32.880 --> 28:33.280]  Okay.
[28:33.920 --> 28:35.500]  Was it 1.40 you said on this video?
[28:35.620 --> 28:36.880]  1.40. A minute forty.
[28:37.480 --> 28:38.560]  Don Zimmer fight.
[28:39.740 --> 28:41.380]  He's storming out there. He's walking
[28:41.380 --> 28:42.740]  out. He's storming out.
[28:42.740 --> 28:44.340]  He's got things to say.
[28:44.820 --> 28:46.620]  Oh, he's gonna talk to the umpire. He is.
[28:46.680 --> 28:48.760]  He just got thrown out of the game, I believe. Moving a lot
[28:48.760 --> 28:50.520]  slower back then than he did in his later years.
[28:50.640 --> 28:51.800]  He's trying to be intimidating.
[28:52.420 --> 28:54.600]  You said 1.40? 1.40.
[28:54.680 --> 28:56.100]  Well, we're way past that now.
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.360]  Alright, helmet's off.
[28:59.080 --> 29:00.760]  Umpire off. They're going back
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.720]  and forth. They're talking. Oh, arms are
[29:02.720 --> 29:04.660]  flying. Yep, that's the first aggression
[29:04.660 --> 29:06.640]  move. He's pointing to outside.
[29:07.780 --> 29:08.740]  Disagreeing. Back
[29:08.740 --> 29:10.780]  and forth. The points have begun.
[29:10.780 --> 29:12.720]  The pointing has begun.
[29:13.100 --> 29:14.780]  Yep. That is
[29:14.780 --> 29:16.680]  the non-physical
[29:16.680 --> 29:18.760]  punch. They're just throwing back and forth. Zimmer
[29:18.760 --> 29:20.740]  hands in the air for a second time. He's letting
[29:20.740 --> 29:22.900]  them know. He's doing the walk back arms
[29:22.900 --> 29:24.640]  throw. Now he's kicking dirt.
[29:25.100 --> 29:26.880]  He's comboing the arms throw
[29:26.880 --> 29:28.680]  with the dirt kick. He's so
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.560]  fast. His arms are like bullets.
[29:31.060 --> 29:32.460]  Are you ready for the finishing move, Gavin?
[29:32.860 --> 29:34.120]  Finishing move about to come up.
[29:34.760 --> 29:36.760]  Hands on the hip. He's like, listen, I'm a man of
[29:36.760 --> 29:38.460]  reason. I'm listening to you.
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.300]  Do another arm
[29:40.300 --> 29:42.420]  throw. The umpire doesn't have much to say. He's just staring.
[29:42.520 --> 29:44.480]  He doesn't know what to say. The zim is going full
[29:44.480 --> 29:46.420]  on. You can see his vein popping out.
[29:46.640 --> 29:48.440]  Oh! Arms out. Hands up.
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.340]  Rolling the sleeves up.
[29:50.840 --> 29:51.960]  Now the umpire's back.
[29:52.320 --> 29:54.280]  Now the umpire has a point to make.
[29:55.040 --> 29:56.120]  Look at his eyes!
[29:56.340 --> 29:58.480]  The hat's off! The hat is
[29:58.480 --> 30:00.220]  off! That is the finishing move.
[30:00.640 --> 30:02.320]  You cannot counter when the guy
[30:02.320 --> 30:04.460]  takes the hat off. Oh
[30:04.460 --> 30:06.380]  God, it's like two birds trying to
[30:06.380 --> 30:07.240]  fly over a nut.
[30:09.740 --> 30:10.420]  That was
[30:10.420 --> 30:11.920]  so fast and weird.
[30:14.000 --> 30:14.600]  That man
[30:14.600 --> 30:16.140]  is my hero. He's great.
[30:16.920 --> 30:18.360]  Oh my God, thank you
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.460]  for bringing that into my life.
[30:20.400 --> 30:22.320]  Oh my God, and I'm... Andrew, I didn't even
[30:22.320 --> 30:24.240]  show you. Hold on a second. Geoff, what
[30:24.720 --> 30:26.080]  were you doing in 1989?
[30:26.900 --> 30:27.340]  1989?
[30:28.180 --> 30:29.660]  That's when that video was from.
[30:30.120 --> 30:32.260]  I was 14. I was
[30:32.260 --> 30:33.060]  in
[30:34.980 --> 30:35.340]  ninth
[30:35.340 --> 30:36.920]  grade. I was in high school. Freshman in high school.
[30:37.200 --> 30:38.560]  I was probably watching that game.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.760]  I was a huge baseball fan in
[30:42.760 --> 30:44.960]  1989. Huge Cubs fan. Huge Don
[30:44.960 --> 30:46.980]  Zimmer fan. There were like
[30:46.980 --> 30:49.000]  three channels on TV that
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.780]  played baseball. WTBS,
[30:50.900 --> 30:52.480]  WGN, and I don't know.
[30:52.760 --> 30:54.920]  Some other channel. And so I watched every
[30:54.920 --> 30:56.500]  White Sox and Cubs game that was on TV.
[30:56.580 --> 30:58.960]  And the Braves, because that's all that was available
[30:58.960 --> 31:00.960]  to me. So I probably saw that game when it
[31:00.960 --> 31:02.860]  happened. Or maybe not. I don't know.
[31:03.100 --> 31:05.000]  They have the Summer of Zimmer
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.980]  or the Zimmer Boys, something like that. It's like
[31:06.980 --> 31:08.960]  a VHS chronicling a
[31:08.960 --> 31:11.020]  championship season they had. It's
[31:11.020 --> 31:12.740]  on YouTube. We should watch that at some point.
[31:13.120 --> 31:15.000]  I think that'd be fun. What, just watch it together?
[31:15.340 --> 31:16.940]  Yeah. I think we should. It's like an hour
[31:16.940 --> 31:18.600]  long. Look at this fucking
[31:18.600 --> 31:20.020]  awesome shirt I'm wearing.
[31:23.520 --> 31:25.020]  In the library as well?
[31:25.020 --> 31:26.960]  That is that era of Don Zimmer
[31:26.960 --> 31:27.860]  as well. It is.
[31:29.580 --> 31:30.540]  It's appropriate
[31:30.540 --> 31:31.940]  to the time of the video.
[31:32.140 --> 31:33.440]  I really appreciate
[31:33.440 --> 31:35.920]  that your entire wardrobe is slowly becoming
[31:35.920 --> 31:37.760]  Don Zimmer themed. I was telling Gavin
[31:37.760 --> 31:39.900]  I'm working on a Zimmer only wardrobe
[31:39.900 --> 31:42.120]  if I can get away
[31:42.120 --> 31:43.620]  with it. That's amazing.
[31:44.720 --> 31:45.840]  Oh man, speaking of the
[31:45.840 --> 31:47.960]  library, this is a
[31:47.960 --> 31:49.940]  really short brief story I could tell that's
[31:49.940 --> 31:51.020]  related to Nick and I.
[31:51.780 --> 31:53.880]  Nick and I had a little incident earlier this week
[31:54.620 --> 31:55.700]  in my library
[31:56.080 --> 31:57.820]  where, poor Nick had nothing to do
[31:57.820 --> 31:59.100]  with it, but it was his fault.
[32:00.380 --> 32:01.740]  He asked me to record some
[32:01.740 --> 32:03.760]  lines. He asked me to record
[32:04.060 --> 32:05.600]  ad reads yesterday, or Monday.
[32:06.100 --> 32:07.760]  And I was like, yeah man, I can do
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.660]  that. And then I was doing something else and then I thought,
[32:09.720 --> 32:11.580]  you know what? I'm not going to let time get away from me.
[32:11.880 --> 32:13.640]  I'm going to run over and I'm going to do Nick's ad reads
[32:13.640 --> 32:15.300]  right now, even though
[32:15.300 --> 32:17.540]  I have something else going on. But I was like, I just want to get him out of the way.
[32:17.780 --> 32:19.720]  So I run into my room and I start to
[32:19.720 --> 32:21.360]  do them and I set it up and
[32:21.980 --> 32:23.260]  as right as I'm starting to record
[32:23.260 --> 32:25.160]  I realize that I can hear Millie
[32:25.160 --> 32:27.140]  watching Grey's Anatomy or some shit
[32:27.140 --> 32:29.240]  in her room. And so I go like, oh I should probably
[32:29.240 --> 32:31.160]  shut the door. So I get up to shut the little
[32:31.160 --> 32:32.960]  saloon doors that, you know,
[32:33.320 --> 32:35.280]  shut my library off from the rest
[32:35.280 --> 32:37.080]  of the house. And somehow
[32:38.020 --> 32:38.800]  opening the
[32:38.800 --> 32:41.080]  one door, just opening the door,
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.200]  it... I'll never
[32:43.640 --> 32:44.940]  for as long as I live
[32:44.940 --> 32:47.400]  understand how this happened and I wish I could go back
[32:47.400 --> 32:49.140]  and study it, like the
[32:49.140 --> 32:50.920]  Zapruder film, because it's phenomenal.
[32:51.660 --> 32:52.880]  I just opened
[32:52.880 --> 32:54.900]  the door that wasn't touching or connected
[32:54.900 --> 32:56.800]  it wasn't even touching the wall, it was just like half open.
[32:57.100 --> 32:59.000]  I just opened it and when I did that
[32:59.000 --> 33:00.860]  this giant picture of Jean-Paul Sartre
[33:00.860 --> 33:03.100]  hanging on my wall fell down
[33:03.100 --> 33:04.920]  and when it fell down, you know
[33:04.920 --> 33:06.780]  how my wall has... I didn't tell you this part, Nick,
[33:06.820 --> 33:09.100]  I found this out later. My wall has horizontal
[33:09.100 --> 33:10.740]  like wooden beams across it.
[33:10.840 --> 33:12.860]  It ripped one of the beams off
[33:12.860 --> 33:14.900]  my wall. And it
[33:14.900 --> 33:16.860]  then hit my doorknob and
[33:16.860 --> 33:19.140]  it shot my doorknob across the room
[33:19.140 --> 33:21.180]  and ripped the doorknob off my
[33:21.180 --> 33:22.560]  door and left a giant hole.
[33:23.360 --> 33:24.780]  The picture frame got broken,
[33:24.980 --> 33:27.300]  the picture inside the frame got fucked up,
[33:27.560 --> 33:28.980]  the wall got broken
[33:28.980 --> 33:30.800]  and I lost a doorknob.
[33:30.940 --> 33:32.540]  All because Nick asked me to do lines.
[33:35.900 --> 33:37.240]  I was telling him about it
[33:37.240 --> 33:39.260]  I was telling him about it as I was recording
[33:39.260 --> 33:41.440]  I'm like, Nick, you're not going to believe what's happening right now in this room.
[33:41.960 --> 33:43.120]  And then after I
[33:43.120 --> 33:44.640]  finished, I found out it was way worse.
[33:45.720 --> 33:47.220]  Unbelievable. I'm blown away the doorknob
[33:47.220 --> 33:47.780]  flew off.
[33:47.840 --> 33:50.300]  I'm going to show you a picture of it. Hold on.
[33:50.720 --> 33:56.860]  Have you ever lost a doorknob, Gavin?
[33:57.420 --> 33:57.860]  No.
[33:58.640 --> 34:00.340]  I've not owned a lot of doorknobs.
[34:00.580 --> 34:01.880]  I'm more of a handle guy.
[34:03.140 --> 34:04.920]  I don't think I've ever bought
[34:04.920 --> 34:05.840]  a doorknob.
[34:08.460 --> 34:09.420]  Plenty of handles.
[34:10.400 --> 34:11.820]  You've bought a lot of handles?
[34:12.280 --> 34:13.640]  Well, more than doorknobs, yeah.
[34:14.360 --> 34:15.620]  Why are you buying
[34:18.100 --> 34:18.740]  loose handles?
[34:19.300 --> 34:20.240]  Well, I like swapped
[34:20.240 --> 34:22.680]  I got a set that had like a lock on it.
[34:22.760 --> 34:23.180]  I was younger.
[34:23.440 --> 34:24.520]  Oh, you wanted privacy.
[34:24.760 --> 34:27.600]  I wanted a lock on the door, so I bought one, I installed it.
[34:27.720 --> 34:29.780]  That's the only time I think I've ever bought a handle.
[34:31.620 --> 34:32.420]  There's not a time
[34:32.420 --> 34:33.460]  where I bought a doorknob.
[34:33.840 --> 34:35.700]  I had a friend, I had a bet
[34:36.400 --> 34:37.340]  that the doorknob
[34:42.040 --> 34:43.720]  doesn't get any more doorknob than that.
[34:44.600 --> 34:44.920]  No!
[34:46.100 --> 34:47.480]  What if you'd got locked in
[34:47.480 --> 34:48.360]  because of that?
[34:50.140 --> 34:51.540]  Well, that would have been
[34:51.540 --> 34:53.480]  even funnier. There's another door in the room, but
[34:54.080 --> 34:55.720]  yeah. You've got a spare door, you've got
[34:55.720 --> 34:57.580]  a hot swap door. Yeah, I've got a back door
[34:57.580 --> 34:58.340]  that goes out to the back.
[34:59.800 --> 35:01.860]  Yeah, so I just have a fucking hole
[35:01.860 --> 35:03.820]  in my door now, where that was.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.460]  I guess it was just covering up some
[35:06.540 --> 35:07.780]  shoddy craftsmanship by the people
[35:07.780 --> 35:09.380]  at Flipthouse. Fuck it, I'll take a picture of that.
[35:09.540 --> 35:11.900]  You guys keep talking, I'm going to show you this other fucking awesome thing.
[35:11.900 --> 35:12.280]  Hold on.
[35:19.220 --> 35:21.200]  I need more knobs in my life
[35:21.200 --> 35:22.300]  instead of handles though, cause
[35:22.760 --> 35:25.000]  I think a doorknob is harder for a
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.940]  cat to operate. Cause they're pretty
[35:26.940 --> 35:28.900]  damn good at handles. Are they?
[35:29.280 --> 35:31.020]  You just gotta, I don't know, my cat is
[35:31.020 --> 35:33.140]  old to the point where it's not an issue.
[35:33.460 --> 35:34.700]  I don't think I even knew you had a cat.
[35:34.880 --> 35:36.260]  I don't know anything about you.
[35:37.300 --> 35:37.900]  I've had
[35:38.680 --> 35:40.440]  my cat for 20 years.
[35:43.540 --> 35:44.460]  She's 20
[35:44.460 --> 35:45.200]  years old.
[35:51.340 --> 35:52.540]  This isn't a new
[35:52.540 --> 35:53.640]  addition to my life.
[35:54.140 --> 35:55.240]  We were discussing
[35:55.240 --> 35:58.520]  at dinner last
[35:58.520 --> 35:59.720]  night how little
[36:00.300 --> 36:01.740]  Gavin knows about you, Andrew.
[36:02.940 --> 36:04.440]  I was filling him in, I was like
[36:04.440 --> 36:06.460]  how do you not know these basic things about Andrew?
[36:07.420 --> 36:08.520]  I just feel like
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.220]  I don't ask a lot of personal questions.
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.340]  I ask a lot of questions that make you sound
[36:12.340 --> 36:14.500]  like an insane person. Like how you
[36:14.500 --> 36:16.200]  make food and shit. But not
[36:16.200 --> 36:18.660]  about your family or your living situation.
[36:19.100 --> 36:20.500]  It's the doorknob again.
[36:20.660 --> 36:22.240]  I reset the damn doorknob. Hold on.
[36:26.780 --> 36:28.600]  You got a cat when you were 7?
[36:29.120 --> 36:29.520]  Yeah.
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.160]  It's still around. It's still around.
[36:32.340 --> 36:34.340]  Sam is still around, but she's very old.
[36:34.580 --> 36:36.480]  She doesn't jump
[36:36.480 --> 36:37.440]  that much.
[36:38.420 --> 36:39.960]  Also not the greatest with vision. Yeah.
[36:40.120 --> 36:41.880]  I've had Sam my whole life.
[36:42.080 --> 36:44.840]  I've known you online for...
[36:44.840 --> 36:45.500]  2007.
[36:47.160 --> 36:47.960]  13 years?
[36:48.380 --> 36:49.280]  Yeah. Around then.
[36:49.920 --> 36:52.360]  Here's the problem with us, Gavin. I'm somebody who doesn't
[36:52.360 --> 36:54.320]  just share personal information
[36:54.320 --> 36:56.260]  or that type of thing. And you never
[36:56.260 --> 36:58.160]  ask. I don't want to intrude.
[36:58.260 --> 37:00.420]  I feel like you'll tell me shit. I feel the same way.
[37:00.520 --> 37:02.040]  I feel like why would anyone want to know?
[37:02.180 --> 37:04.760]  I just don't talk about it.
[37:04.760 --> 37:06.460]  So, you and I
[37:06.460 --> 37:08.860]  great friendship, and if we could
[37:08.860 --> 37:10.620]  talk for literally years every day,
[37:10.680 --> 37:12.860]  and I don't think we'd ever enter a personal...
[37:13.340 --> 37:14.680]  We're like a friendship without
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.900]  any foundation. It's built on nothing.
[37:17.360 --> 37:18.260]  Oh, there's the hole.
[37:21.100 --> 37:21.580]  Wait.
[37:22.860 --> 37:23.340]  What?
[37:24.040 --> 37:26.800]  That's what was behind my doorknob.
[37:27.240 --> 37:28.500]  Dude, no wonder it flew off.
[37:28.840 --> 37:30.760]  How did you not just pull it off when you used
[37:30.760 --> 37:32.360]  the handle? I don't know, man.
[37:32.360 --> 37:34.260]  Never came up. Never happened.
[37:34.840 --> 37:36.520]  Looks like somebody shot your door.
[37:36.860 --> 37:37.420]  It's great.
[37:42.820 --> 37:43.700]  Home ownership.
[37:44.220 --> 37:46.220]  So, wait. How does Geoff know about your
[37:46.220 --> 37:48.140]  personal life? Did he ask?
[37:48.560 --> 37:50.460]  I don't know. That's a great question.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.260]  Well, I've known
[37:52.820 --> 37:54.380]  Andrew for, I don't know,
[37:54.440 --> 37:55.700]  over a decade, and
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.080]  we've had a million conversations.
[37:58.280 --> 38:00.140]  I know a shit about your personal life, too, Gavin.
[38:00.640 --> 38:02.120]  A, I listen, and
[38:02.120 --> 38:04.020]  B, I remember, and
[38:04.020 --> 38:06.220]  C, I ask questions. Yeah, but I know stuff
[38:06.220 --> 38:07.820]  about your life. It's equal.
[38:08.240 --> 38:10.080]  Yeah, because you've asked me questions. I don't know why
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.340]  you refuse to ask Andrew questions.
[38:14.700 --> 38:15.800]  You've also lived together,
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.780]  so I feel like that's an additional layer.
[38:18.120 --> 38:19.200]  Like, it's just, you don't...
[38:19.200 --> 38:21.660]  What if we lived together for six months, Andrew?
[38:23.960 --> 38:25.880]  That'd be... I don't know. That'd be interesting.
[38:26.300 --> 38:27.780]  You wouldn't want to be roommates for six months?
[38:28.140 --> 38:29.520]  No, I would be totally fine with that.
[38:29.520 --> 38:31.640]  That'd be great. I think we'd get a lot more
[38:31.640 --> 38:32.080]  doorknobs.
[38:32.700 --> 38:35.540]  I'd have to adjust the way I live
[38:35.540 --> 38:37.560]  to fit within the boundaries of your life
[38:37.560 --> 38:39.000]  and your rules, but I think it'd be fine.
[38:39.420 --> 38:41.120]  I don't... What do you mean? I'm not a big rule.
[38:41.440 --> 38:43.640]  I'm not a big rule guy. I'd go to the kitchen
[38:43.640 --> 38:45.420]  and, you know, the waffle maker would be
[38:45.420 --> 38:47.160]  in your bedroom. No, I would...
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.080]  If we were... If I felt that
[38:49.080 --> 38:51.080]  there would be a community waffle maker,
[38:51.400 --> 38:52.980]  I would not hoard the supplies.
[38:53.420 --> 38:55.400]  I'm not like a fucking Mad Max villain
[38:55.400 --> 38:57.380]  with water. It would be in the communal
[38:57.380 --> 38:59.480]  area. We'd all... We could share.
[39:00.120 --> 39:01.340]  I'm not gonna hoard anything.
[39:01.860 --> 39:03.040]  Okay. Well, that's good to know.
[39:03.460 --> 39:05.520]  Yeah. I think it would be pretty uneventful,
[39:05.660 --> 39:06.980]  honestly. It would be like
[39:07.520 --> 39:09.460]  an occasional... Why did we do... We'd be three
[39:09.460 --> 39:11.400]  months in and we'd be like, if we did this for content
[39:11.400 --> 39:12.700]  reasons, this was a mistake.
[39:13.060 --> 39:14.860]  We'd just be coexisting nicely.
[39:15.060 --> 39:17.400]  We're just watching Mr. Bean. It's just like
[39:17.400 --> 39:19.600]  it's just strange. Like, nobody needs this.
[39:20.020 --> 39:21.400]  Andrew took it upon himself to try
[39:21.400 --> 39:23.320]  and watch every episode of Mr. Bean because
[39:23.320 --> 39:25.360]  I made one reference to Mr. Bean
[39:25.360 --> 39:26.760]  two episodes ago.
[39:27.060 --> 39:29.620]  Well, we talked about it. That's a little...
[39:29.620 --> 39:31.640]  You're narrowing how much we talked about Mr. Bean.
[39:31.640 --> 39:33.480]  Well, I mean, that's the reason we started talking about Bean
[39:33.480 --> 39:35.060]  is because... That is true.
[39:35.940 --> 39:37.380]  Yeah, but then it led into an extended
[39:37.380 --> 39:39.420]  conversation in which that claim
[39:39.420 --> 39:41.480]  or the commitment happened. Have you finished Bean?
[39:41.660 --> 39:43.480]  Are you all the way through? I haven't watched it
[39:43.480 --> 39:44.280]  since we last spoke.
[39:45.500 --> 39:47.200]  But I will. What is your opinion
[39:47.200 --> 39:49.520]  thus far? I think it's a really good show.
[39:49.660 --> 39:51.440]  I think there are times where if you don't find
[39:51.440 --> 39:53.400]  the bit funny, they extend every idea
[39:53.400 --> 39:54.800]  out to its fullest extent.
[39:54.980 --> 39:57.460]  So if you're not immediately on board, it's like, oh, I got
[39:57.460 --> 39:59.280]  like three minutes of just this
[39:59.280 --> 40:01.400]  continuing gag. But when it does
[40:01.400 --> 40:03.420]  work, it's incredible. And I think it's
[40:03.420 --> 40:05.380]  an important show in a
[40:05.380 --> 40:07.480]  comedic sense. Of like, if you're growing up
[40:07.480 --> 40:09.520]  watching it. Man, I guess I need to go back and re-watch
[40:09.520 --> 40:11.500]  episodes. I can't remember Mr. Bean ever not
[40:11.500 --> 40:13.520]  being funny. Like, bits not working
[40:13.520 --> 40:15.280]  and stuff. It's just, they're
[40:15.280 --> 40:17.500]  different. The example I gave
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.360]  to Gavin is there's one where he's like making a
[40:19.360 --> 40:21.320]  sandwich on a bench. And it's like,
[40:21.320 --> 40:23.400]  oh, he's just pulling stuff out of his jacket. And I've seen
[40:23.400 --> 40:25.220]  him do this before. And now it's just like
[40:25.220 --> 40:27.320]  three minutes of like, I get, he has
[40:27.320 --> 40:28.140]  everything in his jacket.
[40:30.260 --> 40:31.340]  Yeah, he kind of does that in the first
[40:31.340 --> 40:33.580]  episode with the, like the pens and the
[40:33.580 --> 40:35.420]  pink pen. Yeah, but the pen, the pen, yeah, all that
[40:35.420 --> 40:37.420]  is great. Like, especially the first time
[40:37.420 --> 40:39.320]  I watched it. I went back and I re-watched the
[40:39.320 --> 40:41.100]  first episode. I liked it so much. But
[40:41.940 --> 40:43.420]  haven't finished the show. I'm like
[40:43.420 --> 40:44.820]  halfway through. It's okay.
[40:45.620 --> 40:47.160]  It's really, I think if you grew up with it,
[40:47.260 --> 40:49.360]  it would be amazing. Did Gavin tell you
[40:49.360 --> 40:51.160]  that he met him at a grocery store once?
[40:51.320 --> 40:53.460]  He did not. Yeah. Well, he did.
[40:53.880 --> 40:55.400]  That's true. He asked me where
[40:55.400 --> 40:57.200]  the, what was it, ginger?
[40:57.460 --> 40:58.560]  Yeah, he asked me where the ginger was.
[40:59.140 --> 41:01.420]  Just one of those little facts
[41:01.420 --> 41:03.040]  I know about Gavin's life
[41:03.040 --> 41:05.120]  because I've listened to him.
[41:07.740 --> 41:08.180]  Um...
[41:08.180 --> 41:09.380]  I have a thing I could
[41:09.380 --> 41:11.580]  talk to you guys about. I texted you about it.
[41:12.320 --> 41:13.140]  Left you in suspense.
[41:13.360 --> 41:14.700]  I texted...
[41:15.340 --> 41:16.780]  I forgot about that until this moment.
[41:17.940 --> 41:18.440]  Yeah!
[41:20.280 --> 41:22.760]  Let me find the text. I don't remember
[41:22.760 --> 41:24.940]  this text. Oh, it's poop related, dude.
[41:25.060 --> 41:26.420]  I want to get into this.
[41:26.540 --> 41:26.920]  Oh!
[41:29.220 --> 41:31.000]  So, I just texted
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.820]  Geoff and Gavin something along
[41:32.820 --> 41:34.560]  the lines of, I might shit myself.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.860]  I think we ended with you
[41:36.860 --> 41:38.620]  saying if shitting was an
[41:38.620 --> 41:40.600]  Olympic event, you would have just earned yourself a bronze.
[41:40.600 --> 41:42.640]  It was a bronze medal performance
[41:42.640 --> 41:44.920]  in like a class where Usain Bolt
[41:44.920 --> 41:47.160]  is in the race. Like, there's no way I could get a gold
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.060]  but it's like, in a different year
[41:49.060 --> 41:51.040]  that could have been a silver. That could have been
[41:51.040 --> 41:52.880]  a gold. It was a great performance.
[41:53.040 --> 41:54.820]  I don't, as established before,
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.120]  I think at some point on this show,
[41:57.240 --> 41:58.960]  I don't shit in away games.
[41:59.320 --> 42:00.240]  I'm a home shitter.
[42:00.820 --> 42:02.020]  I need to feel comfortable.
[42:02.580 --> 42:04.980]  I haven't used a public toilet in probably
[42:04.980 --> 42:06.620]  like 15 years or so.
[42:06.920 --> 42:09.000]  Can I just say, I looked that up to see if
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.160]  there is a unit of measurement in 15
[42:11.160 --> 42:12.720]  year increments and it's called an
[42:12.720 --> 42:14.740]  indiction. So you have not
[42:14.740 --> 42:16.860]  shit away from home in one
[42:16.860 --> 42:17.540]  indiction.
[42:18.440 --> 42:20.700]  Yeah, what I deem to be home. Now that
[42:20.700 --> 42:22.540]  doesn't necessarily mean my actual
[42:22.540 --> 42:24.600]  home. Like if I'm on vacation
[42:24.600 --> 42:26.300]  I would make the hotel
[42:26.300 --> 42:28.680]  my home toilet. It's just the
[42:28.680 --> 42:30.560]  personal, it's not like anyone
[42:30.560 --> 42:32.960]  A lustrum is five?
[42:34.620 --> 42:36.680]  So Andrew's cat is an indiction
[42:36.680 --> 42:38.580]  and a lustrum old? Andrew
[42:38.580 --> 42:40.880]  hasn't shit outside of his house in three lustrums.
[42:41.480 --> 42:42.900]  Which happens to be
[42:42.900 --> 42:44.020]  one indiction.
[42:51.200 --> 42:52.640]  So I was at
[42:53.100 --> 42:54.720]  Go ahead, what were you going to say?
[42:54.760 --> 42:55.520]  I'm just laughing.
[42:55.840 --> 42:58.600]  I was at like a small
[42:59.600 --> 43:00.840]  gathering and I don't know
[43:00.840 --> 43:02.920]  what, typically I'm pretty good. I had
[43:02.920 --> 43:04.540]  Is this family or friends?
[43:04.820 --> 43:07.020]  Family. It's a family gathering.
[43:07.440 --> 43:08.920]  I need to add to the list by the way
[43:08.920 --> 43:10.860]  You're a home game
[43:12.120 --> 43:12.520]  unverified
[43:14.020 --> 43:14.820]  vertical wiper.
[43:15.140 --> 43:17.240]  You're just putting in all the requirements of your turds.
[43:17.800 --> 43:18.560]  Okay, I'm up to date.
[43:18.880 --> 43:20.460]  And I don't, as I established
[43:20.460 --> 43:22.560]  I'm a home shitter. So I was like
[43:22.560 --> 43:24.980]  I'll just wait. I'll just wait until I get to
[43:24.980 --> 43:26.920]  a home toilet. And I was going to get
[43:26.920 --> 43:29.100]  picked up by someone. And so
[43:29.100 --> 43:30.880]  I was like okay, I can hold it
[43:30.880 --> 43:32.080]  For the purpose of shitting?
[43:32.940 --> 43:34.960]  Was somebody picking you up? No, no, no, no
[43:34.960 --> 43:36.700]  I was going somewhere else after the fact.
[43:36.700 --> 43:38.780]  So I was just going to like, that is a place
[43:38.780 --> 43:40.660]  I'd rather shit at than where I'm currently at.
[43:40.740 --> 43:42.740]  I think I can hold it. I view this as an away.
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.300]  I view the other one as a home toilet.
[43:44.920 --> 43:46.120]  So I get there
[43:46.860 --> 43:48.260]  I get in the car and they're like
[43:48.260 --> 43:50.360]  I really want a burger at this place.
[43:50.540 --> 43:52.800]  And I was like oh god, this is fucking
[43:53.300 --> 43:54.320]  this is a problem.
[43:55.140 --> 43:56.580]  I'm going to hold my, because I almost
[43:56.580 --> 43:58.920]  shit on the way to the pickup spot.
[43:59.660 --> 44:00.320]  It was close.
[44:00.620 --> 44:02.180]  You're not vocalizing your
[44:02.180 --> 44:04.600]  Not at all. You're trying to hold it in and just
[44:04.600 --> 44:06.600]  Because I'm a polite
[44:07.640 --> 44:08.560]  individual, I'm like
[44:08.560 --> 44:10.620]  if I say we need to skip
[44:10.620 --> 44:12.040]  your burger, I gotta shit.
[44:12.160 --> 44:14.480]  I'll just be hearing about, oh man, I'm so excited
[44:14.480 --> 44:16.080]  about that burger and I didn't get it.
[44:16.260 --> 44:17.640]  I didn't want to deal with that.
[44:17.960 --> 44:19.860]  So I'm just like, we're just going to clench hard.
[44:19.980 --> 44:21.500]  We're going to clench as hard as we can.
[44:23.600 --> 44:24.580]  Can I ask
[44:24.580 --> 44:25.680]  a question?
[44:26.100 --> 44:28.720]  And I apologize if you covered this and I missed it, but where is this shit
[44:28.720 --> 44:30.680]  coming from? Like did you have Indian food the night
[44:30.680 --> 44:32.660]  before or is this just like a run of the
[44:32.660 --> 44:34.200]  mill normal shit or is this like
[44:34.200 --> 44:36.920]  No, it's just, I think it was something I ate
[44:36.920 --> 44:38.680]  was just it like flared up
[44:38.680 --> 44:40.620]  like it was all systems go type thing.
[44:40.880 --> 44:42.800]  Was it Fiber 1 bars? Did you have a bunch of Fiber 1 bars?
[44:42.820 --> 44:44.580]  No, it was not Fiber 1 bars.
[44:44.920 --> 44:46.000]  It was a
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.300]  I was like, you know what, I think I got this.
[44:48.400 --> 44:50.480]  And then I started walking and I was like, oh
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.600]  I really don't. I was like clenched
[44:52.600 --> 44:54.720]  on the walk there. I almost
[44:54.720 --> 44:56.420]  shit on the path.
[44:56.480 --> 44:58.520]  I had to stop and just stand for a minute
[44:58.520 --> 45:00.860]  Really? Melissa McCarthy and Bridesmaids?
[45:00.860 --> 45:02.560]  Yeah, I had to
[45:03.920 --> 45:04.960]  How did you
[45:04.960 --> 45:06.680]  let it get this bad so suddenly?
[45:06.800 --> 45:07.360]  I feel like
[45:07.360 --> 45:10.800]  If you're already clenching, it's like you've been holding it
[45:10.800 --> 45:12.180]  in for five hours already.
[45:12.540 --> 45:14.880]  I probably held
[45:14.880 --> 45:16.680]  for an hour before I made the walk
[45:16.680 --> 45:18.720]  and then I left
[45:18.720 --> 45:20.740]  I learn about the burger, I'm like
[45:20.740 --> 45:22.420]  oh Jesus Christ, okay
[45:22.420 --> 45:24.900]  at least it's like a drive
[45:24.900 --> 45:25.880]  through. It was a new place.
[45:26.480 --> 45:28.860]  It was a Triple O's is where the
[45:28.860 --> 45:30.940]  burger was getting picked up from. I did not
[45:30.940 --> 45:32.800]  realize, even though Triple O's is a drive through
[45:32.800 --> 45:34.820]  there is a wait time. So they stop
[45:34.820 --> 45:36.840]  the car and they're like, I'm gonna go get the burger
[45:36.840 --> 45:38.960]  I'll be back. So now I'm in the car
[45:38.960 --> 45:40.600]  and like, this is a fucking problem.
[45:40.760 --> 45:42.800]  Every time we hit a speed bump, I felt
[45:42.800 --> 45:44.700]  like I was gonna rocket out of the chair.
[45:44.820 --> 45:46.860]  It was so bad. Are you sweating
[45:46.860 --> 45:48.700]  at this point? I'm not sweating
[45:48.700 --> 45:50.820]  but I'm like trying to come to terms with the
[45:50.820 --> 45:52.820]  fact that I might shit myself. And what does
[45:52.820 --> 45:54.800]  this mean? And how do I explain it to
[45:54.800 --> 45:56.860]  this person? It's just like, how do I solve this
[45:56.860 --> 45:58.840]  issue? Are they getting a burger for you too?
[45:58.900 --> 46:00.980]  Or just them? They asked if I wanted
[46:00.980 --> 46:02.880]  anything. I said absolutely not. No thank
[46:02.880 --> 46:04.940]  you. What's less polite? Blocking
[46:04.940 --> 46:06.900]  the burger or shitting in the car after the
[46:06.900 --> 46:07.120]  burger?
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.920]  That's a tough measurement. I was at the
[46:10.920 --> 46:12.740]  point of considering, do I just like
[46:12.740 --> 46:15.020]  find a tree in this area?
[46:15.100 --> 46:16.860]  I'm in a mall at this point, but like there
[46:16.860 --> 46:18.840]  are those little kind of tree things in the middle
[46:18.840 --> 46:20.820]  of it. I'm like, do I just shit
[46:20.820 --> 46:23.060]  at the tree and just accept that
[46:23.060 --> 46:24.880]  I don't know what I'm gonna do. This isn't
[46:24.880 --> 46:26.840]  a bad spot. So then I texted you guys
[46:26.840 --> 46:28.980]  I might shit myself. And then I got
[46:28.980 --> 46:31.040]  so close to shit. I had to put all
[46:31.040 --> 46:32.860]  of my focus on not letting it happen. I
[46:32.860 --> 46:34.960]  just threw the phone to the car, like in the bottom
[46:34.960 --> 46:36.860]  of the car. I just sat there and I was like
[46:36.860 --> 46:38.940]  oh fuck. I had to hop
[46:38.940 --> 46:40.960]  out of the car. I couldn't clench hard enough
[46:40.960 --> 46:43.220]  in the seat. So now I'm out of the car
[46:43.980 --> 46:44.380]  clenching.
[46:44.900 --> 46:46.860]  And I'm like, Jesus Christ. Is the phone
[46:46.860 --> 46:48.900]  down because it's potentially
[46:48.900 --> 46:50.880]  a lapse in concentration if you're doing something
[46:50.880 --> 46:52.800]  on your phone? You might forget to clench. Absolutely. That is
[46:52.800 --> 46:54.720]  the thing where it's like, I need to put
[46:54.720 --> 46:57.060]  I need to reroute all focus
[46:57.060 --> 46:58.420]  into not shitting right now.
[47:00.180 --> 47:00.900]  So I'm now
[47:00.900 --> 47:02.580]  standing outside of the car
[47:02.580 --> 47:04.840]  just holding on to it, clenched
[47:04.840 --> 47:06.800]  as hard as I could. And
[47:06.800 --> 47:09.000]  it broke me at that point. I was like, I'm gonna
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.140]  I cannot hold this anymore.
[47:11.520 --> 47:13.040]  Are you clenching with just your ass
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.220]  or are you also adding the hands
[47:15.220 --> 47:17.000]  as a bit of clench? No, I'm
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.040]  going just full ass clench right now. I don't
[47:19.040 --> 47:20.880]  think the hands would do much outside of
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.020]  visual bizarreness.
[47:23.200 --> 47:24.820]  I've never been into this restaurant
[47:24.820 --> 47:26.620]  so I don't know if they have a public bathroom.
[47:27.080 --> 47:28.920]  But I take the walk. In my head, I'm like
[47:28.920 --> 47:30.600]  I'm going in there? I don't know.
[47:31.300 --> 47:32.860]  It's because of COVID. Some places
[47:32.860 --> 47:34.920]  aren't doing the public bathrooms. If
[47:34.920 --> 47:36.980]  this place doesn't have a public bathroom
[47:36.980 --> 47:38.880]  it's just like I'm in the middle
[47:38.880 --> 47:40.960]  of nowhere in no man's land. I might shit
[47:40.960 --> 47:42.920]  myself in this restaurant. So I
[47:43.680 --> 47:44.940]  slowly shuffle in.
[47:46.240 --> 47:46.680]  laughter
[47:48.060 --> 47:48.860]  I walk
[47:48.860 --> 47:50.800]  past the person's waiting for the burger
[47:50.800 --> 47:52.940]  and I'm like I gotta use the bathroom. I shuffle
[47:52.940 --> 47:54.920]  in and they have them. And I'm so
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.700]  fucking- it's like if you were
[47:56.700 --> 47:58.980]  dying of dehydration in the
[47:58.980 --> 48:00.780]  desert and you found a pond.
[48:01.220 --> 48:02.700]  Like it was the relief.
[48:03.000 --> 48:03.920]  It was salvation.
[48:04.640 --> 48:06.780]  I need space. I went into
[48:06.780 --> 48:08.860]  the family bathroom because I didn't trust the other
[48:08.860 --> 48:10.660]  I'm like I'm definitely gonna be good
[48:10.660 --> 48:12.480]  in the family bathroom. Yep.
[48:12.740 --> 48:14.180]  Went in. Did my business.
[48:14.500 --> 48:16.920]  It was one of those situations where
[48:16.920 --> 48:19.200]  just crouching it releases
[48:19.200 --> 48:21.080]  so it's like I just gotta- I hope
[48:21.080 --> 48:22.460]  I'm lined up on this toilet correctly.
[48:22.720 --> 48:24.780]  I hope you're not. We don't want
[48:24.780 --> 48:26.980]  splash damage. We don't want- this has
[48:26.980 --> 48:28.940]  to be a swish. We cannot have any
[48:28.940 --> 48:30.860]  off the rim and in on this
[48:30.860 --> 48:32.940]  scenario. There's no back
[48:32.940 --> 48:33.660]  board for this.
[48:34.340 --> 48:37.040]  I nailed it perfectly. Nothing but ceramic.
[48:37.460 --> 48:38.560]  Yeah. I nailed it perfectly.
[48:39.720 --> 48:40.040]  laughter
[48:42.080 --> 48:42.980]  I got-
[48:42.980 --> 48:44.960]  it went great. It went according to
[48:44.960 --> 48:46.940]  plan and I had like a realization
[48:46.940 --> 48:48.660]  in my life that I've been making
[48:48.660 --> 48:50.900]  a mistake this past 15 years.
[48:51.060 --> 48:53.000]  I've made a huge mistake in how
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.940]  I've handled this. I need
[48:54.940 --> 48:57.060]  to scout bathrooms from this
[48:57.060 --> 48:59.100]  point going forward. If you are
[48:59.100 --> 49:01.060]  if you're in the town
[49:01.060 --> 49:03.260]  I live in, Triple O's fantastic
[49:03.260 --> 49:04.340]  bathroom would recommend.
[49:04.860 --> 49:06.980]  I need to start using like
[49:06.980 --> 49:08.940]  I wouldn't even use a urinal.
[49:09.200 --> 49:11.100]  I'd just hold the pee until I got home.
[49:11.580 --> 49:12.880]  I need to use the urinal
[49:12.880 --> 49:14.360]  as like my scouting tool.
[49:14.660 --> 49:16.900]  That's my way to get into the bathroom, not having to
[49:16.900 --> 49:18.220]  take a shit. I can make a map.
[49:18.680 --> 49:20.700]  Triple O's is kind of like in the middle of town too
[49:20.700 --> 49:22.820]  so it's great. No matter where I am, I can
[49:22.820 --> 49:24.780]  kind of get to the Triple O's. So right now, I got
[49:24.780 --> 49:26.940]  Triple O's on my board as the number one bathroom
[49:26.940 --> 49:28.980]  that I'm aware of in town that's public.
[49:29.260 --> 49:30.740]  I think this is a great idea
[49:30.740 --> 49:32.640]  and here's what I think you should do with it.
[49:32.740 --> 49:34.140]  You've heard of Angie's List, right?
[49:34.600 --> 49:36.300]  No. If you haven't, it's a service
[49:36.820 --> 49:38.820]  that a lot of people will pay for and you go
[49:38.820 --> 49:39.880]  on it and you can find
[49:40.480 --> 49:41.720]  like a contractor,
[49:42.100 --> 49:43.600]  plumber, whatever. It's like
[49:43.600 --> 49:45.840]  the old version of Thumbtack. We need to
[49:45.840 --> 49:47.820]  start Andrew's List and it's a
[49:47.820 --> 49:49.860]  free list. It's an app. Any city
[49:49.860 --> 49:51.740]  you go into where we list
[49:51.740 --> 49:53.800]  you rank the best public toilets
[49:53.800 --> 49:55.960]  for that town. Andrew's List.
[49:56.260 --> 49:57.500]  Download it today. That's such a great idea.
[49:57.660 --> 50:00.220]  I trust myself
[50:00.220 --> 50:01.880]  but I don't know if other people would trust
[50:01.880 --> 50:03.900]  me. I mean, I haven't been in a public bathroom
[50:03.900 --> 50:05.960]  in 15 years. My standards may be
[50:05.960 --> 50:07.940]  low. I want somebody who's in
[50:07.940 --> 50:09.860]  the trenches every day, updating
[50:09.860 --> 50:11.880]  the app. Where's the place to be? Who the
[50:11.880 --> 50:13.700]  fuck is Angie? I don't know who that is.
[50:14.060 --> 50:15.420]  People still pay for that shit.
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.100]  You're the expert if you say you are.
[50:18.300 --> 50:19.260]  That's how shit works anymore.
[50:19.940 --> 50:21.900]  But I'm saying I want more scouts.
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.100]  I don't trust my scouting ability
[50:24.100 --> 50:25.340]  is what I'm saying. You need
[50:25.740 --> 50:28.040]  a street team. Like a shite team.
[50:28.500 --> 50:29.140]  Street team.
[50:29.840 --> 50:30.280]  Yeah.
[50:32.580 --> 50:33.240]  I do.
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.900]  So what would you rate that one?
[50:36.520 --> 50:37.080]  That's...
[50:37.080 --> 50:39.100]  I'd say 8 out of 10.
[50:39.540 --> 50:41.260]  8 out of 10 on Andrew's list? Yeah.
[50:41.420 --> 50:43.780]  It was almost as big as my bedroom.
[50:44.300 --> 50:45.420]  There's so much space in there.
[50:45.860 --> 50:47.860]  I can't comment on what the men's
[50:47.860 --> 50:49.900]  or the women's bathroom is like, but the family bathroom
[50:49.900 --> 50:51.820]  is fantastic. Great
[50:51.820 --> 50:53.540]  toilet. So thus ends an
[50:53.540 --> 50:55.840]  addiction. Thus ends an addiction.
[50:56.400 --> 50:57.460]  Your shitting addiction.
[50:58.360 --> 50:59.880]  Yeah. Bronze
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.220]  medal performance, as I said.
[51:01.520 --> 51:03.840]  You gotta explain why you gave yourself bronze.
[51:03.840 --> 51:05.780]  Oh, well, because if I would have
[51:05.780 --> 51:07.800]  made it back to the place that I was
[51:07.800 --> 51:09.860]  going to, then that would surely
[51:09.860 --> 51:11.740]  be a gold medal. You cannot
[51:11.740 --> 51:13.680]  do better than that. That is a flawless
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.920]  performance. Like going out into the world,
[51:16.040 --> 51:17.700]  coming back home turf, shitting
[51:17.700 --> 51:19.700]  gold medal. Yeah. If you make it to
[51:19.700 --> 51:21.580]  your home toilet, whatever that is,
[51:21.800 --> 51:22.520]  wherever you're going,
[51:23.460 --> 51:25.000]  that's a gold in this scenario.
[51:25.340 --> 51:27.800]  I did not have the strength to continue to
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.720]  hold it back. I held
[51:29.720 --> 51:31.300]  the line as long as I could
[51:31.300 --> 51:33.260]  and I broke it.
[51:33.760 --> 51:35.460]  If I would have made it, I'd say
[51:35.460 --> 51:37.460]  you know what, this is a tough thing
[51:37.460 --> 51:39.440]  because what if... is this a
[51:39.440 --> 51:41.400]  silver medal? You know what, I think I might
[51:41.400 --> 51:43.420]  this might be a silver because it's gonna say a silver
[51:43.420 --> 51:45.460]  would be further distance. But then
[51:45.460 --> 51:47.320]  I'd probably end up shitting myself and I
[51:47.320 --> 51:49.020]  don't feel like that should be above
[51:49.480 --> 51:51.340]  bronze. So I think I got a
[51:51.340 --> 51:53.340]  silver. Bronze would be if you
[51:53.340 --> 51:55.300]  made it and you shit yourself. Like
[51:55.300 --> 51:57.340]  you went 70% of the way. I don't
[51:57.340 --> 51:59.580]  think you can shit yourself and still get a bronze.
[51:59.580 --> 52:01.300]  You don't think that's on the podium?
[52:01.640 --> 52:02.960]  That's a brown. Yeah.
[52:03.400 --> 52:05.460]  Is that a podium? Okay. No, you don't podium
[52:05.460 --> 52:06.800]  finish if you finish...
[52:07.300 --> 52:09.640]  You don't get a podium finish if you finish in your pants
[52:09.640 --> 52:11.500]  dude. Well then what's a silver? Because
[52:11.500 --> 52:13.620]  then if we're going to a silver, I'm then
[52:13.620 --> 52:15.500]  asking for a pullover at a bathroom.
[52:15.820 --> 52:17.400]  Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I understand
[52:17.400 --> 52:19.140]  what you're saying, but I just, I don't
[52:19.140 --> 52:21.540]  I don't think you can... I think
[52:21.540 --> 52:23.640]  a silver's gotta be somewhere
[52:23.640 --> 52:25.440]  in between those two locations but
[52:25.440 --> 52:27.340]  maybe in a ditch. So it's like, it's not
[52:27.340 --> 52:29.240]  in your pants, but you're very
[52:29.240 --> 52:30.680]  close. If you're getting
[52:31.660 --> 52:33.280]  wheeled off the basketball court
[52:33.280 --> 52:35.240]  in a wheelchair because you shit your pants
[52:35.240 --> 52:36.160]  in a playoff game,
[52:37.580 --> 52:39.160]  yeah, you can't win a gold medal.
[52:39.900 --> 52:41.340]  Or any medal. What if you shit out
[52:41.340 --> 52:43.100]  the window of the moving car? That way you're not
[52:43.100 --> 52:45.140]  stopping. You're still going. You're not shitting
[52:45.140 --> 52:47.360]  yourself. You're shitting everyone behind
[52:47.360 --> 52:49.400]  you? Well, you know, the thing about that
[52:49.400 --> 52:50.700]  is... It's like the worst Mario Kart attack.
[52:51.040 --> 52:53.180]  I feel like the judges would
[52:53.180 --> 52:54.960]  give you extra points for difficulty.
[52:54.960 --> 52:56.980]  That is true. I feel
[52:56.980 --> 52:58.400]  like whenever you're about to shit,
[52:59.020 --> 53:00.820]  if you see a toilet,
[53:00.940 --> 53:02.840]  or if you know a toilet is in proximity,
[53:03.400 --> 53:04.800]  it causes you to really
[53:04.800 --> 53:06.660]  need to shit. Oh, absolutely.
[53:07.340 --> 53:08.940]  There's the end in sight. So my
[53:08.940 --> 53:10.900]  question is, if you'd have got to the
[53:10.900 --> 53:12.940]  restaurant and then just right
[53:12.940 --> 53:14.840]  then, with all the hope of there being a toilet,
[53:14.960 --> 53:16.880]  found out that there wasn't one, would you
[53:16.880 --> 53:18.720]  have even made it out of the restaurant before
[53:18.720 --> 53:20.860]  shitting yourself? I have no idea.
[53:20.960 --> 53:22.840]  I mean, that's such a tough
[53:22.840 --> 53:24.940]  call. I don't know. Did you
[53:24.940 --> 53:26.840]  know, they say...
[53:27.760 --> 53:28.680]  I don't want to get into
[53:28.680 --> 53:31.020]  other people's content or other people's podcasts,
[53:31.500 --> 53:32.540]  but there's another podcast
[53:33.900 --> 53:34.980]  that I listen
[53:34.980 --> 53:36.680]  to where one of the producers on the podcast,
[53:36.900 --> 53:39.060]  he only shits about every two to three weeks.
[53:39.400 --> 53:40.300]  Like once every two to three weeks.
[53:40.360 --> 53:42.120]  He has an aversion to shitting.
[53:42.600 --> 53:45.060]  But when he needs to shit desperately like that,
[53:45.560 --> 53:46.980]  he will go
[53:46.980 --> 53:48.060]  and just sit on the toilet
[53:48.060 --> 53:50.840]  for a minute, and then he said the shitting
[53:50.840 --> 53:52.820]  desire goes away. So maybe you could
[53:52.820 --> 53:54.740]  try that if you're in a non-standard
[53:54.740 --> 53:56.740]  unsafe toilet. Maybe you could just try
[53:56.740 --> 53:58.380]  shitting. That sounds backwards.
[53:58.840 --> 54:00.180]  I agree, but that's what he says.
[54:01.120 --> 54:02.220]  It's this dude on a
[54:02.220 --> 54:04.720]  Tom Segura podcast. He says that, yeah,
[54:04.800 --> 54:06.780]  if he ever has to shit really bad, he feels like he's gonna do it.
[54:06.980 --> 54:08.900]  He just sits down on the toilet for like a minute,
[54:09.020 --> 54:10.820]  and then the need goes away. And Dr.
[54:10.920 --> 54:12.660]  Drew Pinsky was on, and he was like, yeah,
[54:12.860 --> 54:14.960]  that makes sense. At the office
[54:14.960 --> 54:16.720]  once, my chair was hidden
[54:16.720 --> 54:18.840]  and replaced with a toilet, and I tried to
[54:18.840 --> 54:20.680]  just use it as my desk chair for a day,
[54:20.720 --> 54:22.500]  and it just made me wanna shit all day.
[54:23.040 --> 54:23.540]  Something about
[54:24.940 --> 54:26.960]  your anus hanging slightly lower
[54:26.960 --> 54:28.820]  than it would on a normal chair. It makes you wanna
[54:30.320 --> 54:30.680]  drop...
[54:30.680 --> 54:33.160]  You know what's funny, man?
[54:33.880 --> 54:34.940]  We've done some really funny
[54:34.940 --> 54:36.760]  stuff over the years. I forgot we replaced
[54:36.760 --> 54:38.940]  your chair with a toilet once.
[54:39.160 --> 54:39.980]  That's a funny joke.
[54:40.740 --> 54:42.880]  The lid was open, Nick. It was...
[54:42.880 --> 54:44.800]  I didn't wanna sit on top of the top lid
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.480]  because it's very thin and it was gonna crack.
[54:46.820 --> 54:48.240]  Yeah. No, that will happen.
[54:49.080 --> 54:50.600]  What a fascinating...
[54:50.600 --> 54:51.720]  Well, what... Hmm.
[54:52.320 --> 54:54.660]  I don't understand why that would make him not want to.
[54:55.060 --> 54:56.080]  I have the opposite problem.
[54:56.300 --> 54:58.460]  I would never do it. I need...
[54:58.460 --> 55:00.280]  I have a colon disease. I need to shit.
[55:00.340 --> 55:02.080]  I shit three times a day, and I need to.
[55:02.180 --> 55:04.420]  If I don't feel right, I don't shit multiple
[55:04.420 --> 55:06.420]  times a day, so I would never try it in a million years.
[55:06.900 --> 55:07.540]  But, uh...
[55:08.060 --> 55:10.520]  I'm just repeating what they said on the show.
[55:11.220 --> 55:12.520]  You ever do the thing where, like,
[55:12.540 --> 55:14.160]  you go to flip the lid up and you miss?
[55:14.520 --> 55:15.980]  And then it just creates tension.
[55:16.160 --> 55:18.580]  Like, it makes everything so much worse. I've had that several times.
[55:18.900 --> 55:19.640]  What does that mean?
[55:19.860 --> 55:22.060]  Like, I need to piss badly, and the lid is down.
[55:22.540 --> 55:23.840]  So I gotta flip the lid up
[55:24.920 --> 55:26.160]  to piss, and I'll...
[55:26.160 --> 55:28.540]  Like, I don't throw it up hard enough, or I'll throw it too hard.
[55:28.800 --> 55:30.360]  It'll bounce off the toilet and go back
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.540]  down, and I'm already in, like, I'm peeing mode.
[55:33.060 --> 55:34.200]  You gotta do, like, a false start.
[55:34.900 --> 55:36.160]  You gotta do... It's like a stutter
[55:36.160 --> 55:38.340]  step of piss. I'm a sitting guy.
[55:39.280 --> 55:40.260]  Yeah? Well, that's fair.
[55:40.560 --> 55:41.800]  There's too much splash with a
[55:41.800 --> 55:43.620]  standing up piss that
[55:43.620 --> 55:45.860]  if you just sit down every time, you have
[55:45.860 --> 55:47.460]  to clean the toilet less.
[55:47.760 --> 55:49.420]  I'm the same. I'm a sitting pee guy now, too.
[55:49.520 --> 55:50.840]  Well, not in public, but, yeah.
[55:51.340 --> 55:52.940]  At my home toilet. Too embarrassing?
[55:53.700 --> 55:55.300]  No, I... Yeah, I'm not gonna go to the movie theater.
[55:55.380 --> 55:57.200]  Well, toilets are dirty, man. I don't wanna...
[55:57.200 --> 55:59.400]  I assume one of the reasons
[55:59.400 --> 56:01.620]  Andrew doesn't wanna away game is because
[56:01.620 --> 56:03.820]  he doesn't wanna shit on some weird, gross, dirty toilet.
[56:04.260 --> 56:05.800]  I don't wanna touch that stuff either, so...
[56:05.800 --> 56:07.600]  Yeah, me neither. I will always pee
[56:07.600 --> 56:09.600]  in a urinal at a movie theater or whatever, but
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.220]  at home, yeah, I'm a sit down peer.
[56:11.720 --> 56:13.740]  I view the public like, let's
[56:13.740 --> 56:15.560]  say, a mall bathroom. That's just
[56:15.560 --> 56:17.980]  like being in a constant airstrike
[56:17.980 --> 56:19.500]  of shit particles. Like,
[56:19.540 --> 56:21.080]  every time you hear a toilet go off...
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.600]  I'll be right back. Hold on a second. Just a second. I'll be right back.
[56:24.020 --> 56:25.520]  I swear to God, if this is another
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.600]  delivery person and I gotta fuckin' go
[56:27.600 --> 56:29.620]  out my building, I'm just not
[56:29.620 --> 56:31.400]  gonna get it. How far is it
[56:31.400 --> 56:33.700]  from, like, where you are to the door?
[56:34.180 --> 56:35.620]  It's... I mean, I have to
[56:35.620 --> 56:37.320]  go down several sets of stairs
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.540]  and then need to walk around...
[56:39.540 --> 56:41.240]  I need to... It's far. It's a distance.
[56:41.240 --> 56:43.280]  Hey, Andrew? There's another
[56:43.980 --> 56:45.060]  package for you. I'm not...
[56:45.060 --> 56:47.240]  You're gonna have to... This one melts.
[56:47.760 --> 56:49.420]  So, you're gonna wanna get out there pretty quickly.
[56:49.500 --> 56:50.260]  It's gonna make a mess.
[56:52.280 --> 56:53.280]  It's a birthday present
[56:53.280 --> 56:55.220]  for you from me and Emily, and I want you to...
[56:55.220 --> 56:56.560]  And Millie, for that matter.
[56:57.080 --> 56:59.280]  Because we love you, and we wanted to celebrate your birthday.
[56:59.440 --> 57:01.300]  Is this getting back at the porta-potty
[57:01.300 --> 57:03.220]  thing? Is this getting back at me for the... I will not...
[57:03.220 --> 57:05.240]  The show will be over by the time I get back.
[57:05.240 --> 57:07.180]  No, it's just...
[57:07.180 --> 57:08.780]  We'll wait. Yeah, we all agreed to wait.
[57:08.960 --> 57:11.020]  We talked about it earlier. Give me a minute.
[57:11.060 --> 57:11.360]  We love you.
[57:13.920 --> 57:14.320]  God...
[57:16.940 --> 57:18.780]  I put all your
[57:18.780 --> 57:20.820]  stupid pastries on the mic
[57:20.820 --> 57:21.240]  thing.
[57:22.680 --> 57:23.660]  Andrew, take your phone.
[57:24.080 --> 57:26.780]  They're your pastries, Andrew! I'm not taking my phone!
[57:27.160 --> 57:28.360]  Take your phone, join the Discord.
[57:28.700 --> 57:30.740]  No, I'm not! Join the Discord from your
[57:30.740 --> 57:32.440]  phone so we can still talk to you, Andrew.
[57:33.580 --> 57:34.760]  I don't have the bits!
[57:35.560 --> 57:36.040]  What?
[57:36.540 --> 57:37.960]  He doesn't have the bits!
[57:38.360 --> 57:40.800]  We'll buy you some new bits as a birthday present!
[57:42.940 --> 57:44.780]  He's so mad about getting
[57:44.780 --> 57:45.940]  free ice cream!
[57:46.260 --> 57:48.720]  Geoff, what you didn't hear when you walked
[57:48.720 --> 57:50.800]  away was the first thing he
[57:50.800 --> 57:52.960]  said was, if this is another
[57:52.960 --> 57:54.780]  delivery, I'm just not gonna go get it.
[57:54.960 --> 57:55.640]  I'm just not.
[57:56.380 --> 57:57.540]  He did say that.
[57:58.540 --> 58:00.460]  There's an angry Canadian dude on the front going,
[58:00.520 --> 58:01.440]  like, I'm just standing out here.
[58:01.440 --> 58:01.860]  Oh!
[58:04.960 --> 58:05.680]  Oh, man.
[58:06.860 --> 58:07.600]  If we would've
[58:07.600 --> 58:09.280]  done it one more time, it would've been perfect.
[58:09.380 --> 58:10.320]  But two's better than nothing.
[58:12.820 --> 58:13.540]  While we're
[58:13.540 --> 58:15.360]  waiting on Andrew to get back, let me tell you a little story,
[58:15.480 --> 58:17.600]  Gav. Andrew doesn't need to hear this, it's no big deal.
[58:17.620 --> 58:18.760]  He listens to the podcast anyway.
[58:19.200 --> 58:21.460]  So last night, Gavin, to celebrate Andrew's
[58:21.460 --> 58:23.180]  birthday, you and I went out to dinner.
[58:23.820 --> 58:25.440]  Yep, and I should verify that
[58:25.440 --> 58:27.460]  today it is raining. It is raining like
[58:27.460 --> 58:29.360]  a motherfucker all day today, I assume
[58:29.360 --> 58:31.220]  because A, we went out to dinner last night,
[58:31.340 --> 58:33.540]  and B, we decided to hang out again this weekend
[58:33.540 --> 58:34.980]  and try to go jet skiing together.
[58:35.340 --> 58:37.300]  So obviously it's going to be a torrential
[58:37.300 --> 58:38.620]  rain for the next week or two.
[58:39.400 --> 58:41.360]  However, it was like a double date. You and Meg, me
[58:41.360 --> 58:43.300]  and Emily, we went out to a lovely dinner.
[58:43.620 --> 58:45.240]  I believe you had the steak frites.
[58:45.540 --> 58:46.360]  I did, yeah.
[58:46.700 --> 58:48.960]  Meg had the cote de porc.
[58:49.240 --> 58:50.580]  The bread was very nice, too.
[58:50.860 --> 58:53.100]  I had the cote de porc Diablo-style,
[58:53.240 --> 58:54.760]  spicy, and Emily had,
[58:55.260 --> 58:57.340]  after some internal debate and a little bit
[58:57.340 --> 58:58.980]  of a debate with me, the mussels.
[58:59.300 --> 59:01.280]  Because she's like, when they're bad, you know, you gotta be careful
[59:01.280 --> 59:03.460]  with mussels, and I don't know if it's the right time to have them.
[59:04.060 --> 59:05.100]  Oh, and she actually asked.
[59:05.400 --> 59:07.440]  She asked the waitress. She was like, how are the mussels?
[59:07.560 --> 59:09.340]  Are they on today? And she was like, oh, they're
[59:09.340 --> 59:11.400]  outstanding today. So she was like, okay.
[59:11.880 --> 59:13.560]  So then we had a lovely dinner, lovely meal.
[59:13.860 --> 59:14.780]  We all went home.
[59:15.680 --> 59:17.240]  It didn't end our friendship or anything.
[59:17.380 --> 59:18.360]  We didn't get into a fight.
[59:19.740 --> 59:21.320]  Just had the nicest stuff to say
[59:21.320 --> 59:22.940]  about you and Meg. And
[59:22.940 --> 59:24.220]  went home, went to bed.
[59:24.800 --> 59:26.040]  Watch some Survivor.
[59:26.260 --> 59:28.240]  We send each other pictures of our bedtime
[59:28.240 --> 59:30.360]  Survivor setups. Yeah, on the ceiling.
[59:30.880 --> 59:31.620]  Yeah, because
[59:32.840 --> 59:34.340]  half the night was us talking about
[59:34.340 --> 59:36.380]  Survivor. You guys were on 35, we're on 36.
[59:37.040 --> 59:37.360]  And
[59:38.220 --> 59:40.420]  I woke up this morning and I had to pee
[59:40.420 --> 59:42.300]  and Emily wasn't in bed, but she has to get up
[59:42.300 --> 59:44.240]  early to go to work. And so I was like,
[59:44.280 --> 59:46.180]  I didn't think anything of it. I walked into my bathroom and
[59:46.180 --> 59:48.320]  she was laying completely naked on
[59:48.320 --> 59:50.080]  the bathroom floor on the tile.
[59:51.200 --> 59:51.840]  Just going...
[59:52.700 --> 59:53.620]  And I was like,
[59:53.760 --> 59:55.920]  oh my god, I thought she'd been
[59:55.920 --> 59:58.040]  stabbed or something. And she was like,
[59:58.080 --> 59:59.820]  I don't feel good. And I was like,
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.560]  oh my god, is it the muscles?
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.200]  And she's like, I have food poisoning.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.500]  And apparently,
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.240]  she was violently
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.740]  vomiting for a while. I slept through
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.800]  the entire thing. And I didn't hear
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.360]  a word. And then she was like,
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.720]  I thought you heard and you were just ignoring
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.900]  me because you're an asshole and you don't care about
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.840]  me. And I was throwing up so much
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.760]  and you just didn't come in to
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.480]  check on me. And I'm like, why does he hate me?
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.660]  I had no fucking clue.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.780]  So, good on not getting
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.740]  the muscles last night. Yeah, I would never
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.100]  get the muscles for that very reason.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.660]  I think it was muscles
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.420]  and oysters I had that time I
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.780]  was shitting the plane and my bed and the shower
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.600]  and stuff. That's true.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.820]  Not only... so apparently when we
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.860]  hang out versus... if we do couples hang out,
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.660]  it's going to be... it could be
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.360]  physically dangerous as well. Hello?
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.360]  Hey, what's up, buddy? Hey!
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.760]  Thanks for the ice cream. Of course, man!
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.560]  You gotta wash down all those baked goods with some
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.920]  fucking yummy birthday ice cream.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.840]  Thanks, I knew where my door was. I got a variety
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.740]  of flavors for you and everything.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.820]  You did? Oh, we talking Dr. Mike?
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.220]  What's happening with Dr. Mike?
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.660]  Speaking of Survivor, that guy to me
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.180]  just looks like if
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.440]  Tony Shalhoub's head only grew back like
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.140]  80% of the way in Men in Black.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.100]  I laugh every time I see him.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.040]  I want him to win.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.080]  Well, keep watching.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.280]  I was just telling
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.860]  Gavin a story. Andrew, we...
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.140]  Gavin and I went out to dinner last night to celebrate
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.060]  your birthday. Uh-huh. And
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.140]  Emily got food poisoning and I woke up
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.820]  this morning to her like... Oh, no!
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.040]  She had like naked on the floor in the bathroom.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.660]  It was pretty bad. Oh, Jesus! Yeah.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.140]  That's rough. Is she fine now?
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.260]  Yeah, she went to work, dude. She was totally fine.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.460]  She just had to get it out of the system.
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.160]  I couldn't believe it. I was like, there's no way you can go to work.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.100]  And she's like, I'm a hairdresser. I can't reschedule
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.100]  stuff. I don't have a choice. And I'm like, that's fair.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.080]  You know?
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.880]  She probably said, uh...
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.040]  Stylist. But yeah. So yeah,
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.160]  she was like, no, I don't... Like, Emily doesn't fuck around.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.920]  She's like, I...
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.060]  She's a... Yeah. She's a hard worker,
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.660]  that one. Poor Emily.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.780]  Man, and she was loving those muscles.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.200]  I sent her some Pedialyte to work
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.120]  to help her.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.900]  But, yeah. Andrew, what
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.120]  flavors did you get? I don't know. I didn't...
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.120]  I just... I grabbed them, put them in the freezer.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.860]  It looked like a bubblegum.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.340]  You got a blue bubblegum.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.020]  I'm guessing cookie dough. There's definitely
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.180]  cookie dough. There's a few. I was wondering
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.220]  whether you would have to displace some of the
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.120]  freezer contents to make room. Or whether
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.780]  you would have room already. Oh, absolutely. Yes.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.840]  No, I had to. I had to shuffle things around.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.840]  But it's good. We got them.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.100]  They're all in. What do you think
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.940]  the next one will be? They're better.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.700]  Is there a next... There's not a next one.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.120]  There can't be a next one. I got...
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.540]  I got pastries. I got ice cream.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.180]  Your laugh makes me think
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:45.840]  there's a next one.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.580]  You motherfucker.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.140]  What's the next one? When is the
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.080]  next one scheduled?
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.680]  Thanks for watching.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.960]  Keep a
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.100]  decent cadence going for you so that you
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.500]  don't have the opportunity to get bored today.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.060]  What? You said you had
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.940]  a sound clip before we leave today. Oh,
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.260]  I do. Fuck. Thanks for reminding me. Andrew, I've got a...
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.260]  If you will indulge me, I've got a sound clip
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.420]  I'd like to play for you guys.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.300]  To set it up a little bit,
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.140]  I've been listening to... I've been, you know, diving
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.220]  into some other content from our company
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.280]  lately, just checking in on things. And so I've been
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.300]  listening to some of our peer
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.320]  podcasts. And one of them
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.380]  is very popular. It's a cooking show
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.880]  with some...
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.280]  like some ugly or less talented people than us, but they're
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.120]  pretty good. A cooking show?
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.300]  It's called Face Jam. Yeah, they eat
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.960]  food and they talk about it, right?
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.280]  And Nick and
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.360]  Eric are actually both on that show. Nick
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.220]  is... he plays a character called the
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.280]  Sauce Monkey, and Eric plays a
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.180]  character... the character of a producer who
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.720]  likes them more than he likes us.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.240]  And as evidence to that, I
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.940]  have this clip I'd like... this is just like
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.140]  just a random episode I was listening to. And
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.340]  this isn't... I played it for Emily and she's like... so that was like
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.200]  cut up from all the whole episode of like
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.180]  a compilation. I was like, no, no, this is just one
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:00.920]  one specific
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.140]  moment. It's interesting
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.220]  and I just want to see what you guys think
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.120]  about it. This is... now I'll tell you
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.180]  hold on, I'll tell you before it goes in.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.140]  Michael Jones
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.260]  makes a joke about how Nick
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.760]  talks to himself in his car.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.140]  And Eric
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.100]  liked that joke.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.400]  What do you think it's like when he drives
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.300]  home from work by himself
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.780]  and just goes, ooh, red light?
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:35.400]  Okay.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.060]  Ooh, red light!
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.280]  It's so fucking funny!
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.300]  Why doesn't
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.200]  he think we're funny? I've never heard
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.320]  Nick... I've never heard Eric laugh like that.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.680]  Interesting.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.480]  Well, I'm muted on this.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.440]  Do you understand how the recording
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.280]  of this works? Versus the recording of
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:54.680]  Face Jam?
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.520]  Listen, all I know is when you talk on Face Jam
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.000]  you're happy and you like them
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.260]  and you laugh like that for an hour and a half
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.020]  straight. And on this podcast
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.920]  you just yell at us and tell us to stop making it.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.080]  You don't listen to my audio file
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.840]  where I'm constantly laughing
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.460]  through what's going on.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.680]  But I'm muted because
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.520]  this is just you guys.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.920]  So what we hear
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.860]  is just you
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.420]  hating us. Watch this.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.120]  Can you hear what I'm saying?
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.100]  No, you can't. Hey, did you know I was talking
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.980]  that whole time, Geoff? No, you didn't.
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.980]  I was muted. Because you don't tell me. You show
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.660]  the world how much you laugh. Why would I tell you?
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.220]  Do you understand the difference? This is insane.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.640]  This is insane.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.720]  See, this is what I'm talking about. If I was Michael
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.840]  right now, you'd be laughing.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.360]  Hold on a second.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:42.740]  Fast food joke.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.300]  Okay, you can laugh now.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.340]  Fast food joke?
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.800]  I said fast food joke, huh? You can laugh now.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:51.560]  Fast
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.660]  fast food
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:54.660]  joke.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.740]  Oh, you're getting something out of him, Geoff.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.520]  That didn't feel like a real laugh to me.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.620]  No, he's... That didn't feel like...
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.400]  You listened?
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.060]  Yeah.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.340]  You listened to the content and what you
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.520]  walked away from it with is fast
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.680]  food joke.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.360]  What I walked away from is
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.480]  Eric likes those people more than he likes us.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.000]  That's fine.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.320]  That's valid.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.760]  I think it's valid too. I don't blame him.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.400]  Then why are you breaking it up?
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.480]  I assume we're higher maintenance, probably.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.060]  Oh, without a doubt. Definitely.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.420]  Absolutely. 100%.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.260]  Yeah. And like the orders of
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.600]  toilets. Yeah.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.540]  And impossible schedules. There are times
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.280]  where I will float ideas
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.160]  to Eric and I do so with the
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.380]  expectation of him saying, no, that's fucking dumb.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.900]  And then like maybe trying to find a middle.
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.220]  And then he just absorbs them like, oh, no.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.280]  I don't expect this to actually happen.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.640]  As is suggesting a thing.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.560]  I get nervous. He's probably like,
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.800]  thank God I have face jam later today
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.740]  to balance this out. Okay.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.960]  Well, yeah, I just love going and hanging out with Michael
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.040]  and then he says fast food joke
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.040]  and I was like, he says some sort of
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.120]  a fast food joke and then you go.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.540]  Yeah, for
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.920]  an hour evidence you presented
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.060]  wasn't even a fast food.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.120]  It was about
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.000]  him leaving a fast food restaurant in his
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.120]  car. That's like the context
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.040]  of the joke is the red light.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.860]  It's like calling
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.880]  a story a mole joke.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.820]  Yeah, it's just
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.180]  the setting of it. It's like you asking
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.000]  what flavor the ramen was when it had
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:27.940]  no bearing on the story.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:30.420]  You done?
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.040]  Thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.580]  See you guys next week.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.240]  Aww. What ending?
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.620]  That was a, yeah.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.540]  Should I honestly expect,
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.080]  I'm trying to decide, do I get back
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:43.980]  in the wire den?
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.080]  Are you out of the wire den right now?
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.580]  I'm like kind of sitting up because I'm expecting
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.180]  to have to shoot out my door again.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.620]  Are we good?
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.340]  Is there a ceasefire, Geoff?
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.920]  Or should I expect another
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.680]  thing?
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.140]  Great.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.280]  You want to give a full outro?
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.060]  Birthday outro?
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.620]  Do I have to? Why don't you?
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.480]  Yeah, you do it.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.480]  66. Thanks for watching.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.260]  Oh, damn it. Thanks for listening to episode
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.180]  66 of F*** Face.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.200]  There's pictures
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.000]  in the video files now
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.040]  for the stuff we talked about. It's pretty sick.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.280]  We had it at one point and went away. It came back.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.700]  I'm happy about it.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.000]  I love that bit. Rate 5!
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.260]  I'll just rate. I shouldn't tell you how many to rate, but 5
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.120]  is the best number in there.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.320]  See you next week. It's going to be a while until we record,
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.120]  but we've got plenty of the bag.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.560]  Happy birthday!
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:36.940]  Yeah!
[01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.510]  How was it?
[01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.910]  That was great.
[01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:46.430]  That was really fantastic.
[01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.950]  What an outro.
[01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.290]  That was an all time.
