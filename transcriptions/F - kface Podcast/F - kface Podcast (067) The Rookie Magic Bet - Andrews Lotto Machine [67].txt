[00:37.680 --> 00:41.520]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face podcast.
[00:41.520 --> 00:43.600]  Uh, I'm Geoff, Andrew, Gavin.
[00:43.800 --> 00:46.180]  It has been too fucking long since we recorded.
[00:46.340 --> 00:47.560]  Andrew, what's the RFA?
[00:48.040 --> 00:50.580]  I didn't well, I didn't think this was going to be a show thing, necessarily.
[00:50.660 --> 00:51.460]  I don't think it's that.
[00:52.280 --> 00:53.820]  I guess if it's interesting enough to talk.
[00:53.960 --> 00:56.560]  So it's so important we're leading off the podcast.
[00:56.800 --> 00:57.880]  It's just it was a funny.
[00:58.020 --> 01:01.520]  I love how petty the NHL can be and how dumb it is.
[01:02.000 --> 01:02.800]  There is a rule.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.500]  So when you draft the player, right, they immediately are on a rookie contract.
[01:06.720 --> 01:07.960]  You sign them to a rookie deal.
[01:08.260 --> 01:09.060]  There are limits to that.
[01:09.060 --> 01:13.420]  The first time a rookie finishes his rookie contract, he becomes a restricted
[01:13.420 --> 01:17.460]  free agent, meaning that any team in the league can offer him a contract.
[01:17.820 --> 01:21.920]  But if he accepts it, the team that drafted him has a week to match it.
[01:22.380 --> 01:25.940]  If they don't match it, the team that sent the contract steals the player
[01:25.940 --> 01:28.260]  and compensates the team with picks.
[01:28.820 --> 01:30.360]  That's what a basic RFA is.
[01:30.700 --> 01:34.900]  Now, that's a completely legal rule, but it's sort of an unwritten agreement
[01:34.900 --> 01:38.780]  between all of the general managers that nobody ever takes advantage of it.
[01:38.780 --> 01:41.860]  Because it only helps the players and it fucks each other over.
[01:41.960 --> 01:43.300]  It like increases their value.
[01:43.780 --> 01:46.320]  So from a cap perspective, they're like, we will not do this.
[01:46.460 --> 01:50.180]  If you want to negotiate long with your rookie coming off his deal,
[01:50.460 --> 01:52.560]  nobody will try to poach him. It happens very rarely.
[01:53.040 --> 01:53.980]  There's a time it happened
[01:53.980 --> 01:56.460]  where it almost caused a fistfight between two general managers.
[01:56.980 --> 01:59.400]  A few days ago, maybe like a week at this point,
[01:59.940 --> 02:05.160]  the Carolina Hurricanes sent an offer to a Montreal Canadiens player
[02:05.160 --> 02:06.480]  and he signed it.
[02:06.480 --> 02:08.700]  So it was a whole thing of like, this rarely happens.
[02:09.380 --> 02:13.780]  It was like a six million dollar contract with a twenty dollar signing bonus.
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.900]  And the reason why they did the twenty dollar signing bonus
[02:16.900 --> 02:20.000]  is because a few years ago, the Canadiens offer
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.160]  sheeted one of the Carolina Hurricanes players and his jersey number was 20.
[02:24.580 --> 02:25.420]  They did not forget.
[02:25.620 --> 02:27.140]  They held on to that for years.
[02:27.340 --> 02:30.560]  And then at the first point in which they could get revenge,
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.420]  offer sheeted a guy with the same jersey number and a twenty dollar signing bonus.
[02:34.680 --> 02:35.600]  There's no reason for it.
[02:35.600 --> 02:36.740]  Outside of just pure pettiness.
[02:37.340 --> 02:38.520]  That's what an RFA is.
[02:38.740 --> 02:39.740]  So it's like an FU.
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.680]  It was a total FU.
[02:41.920 --> 02:43.000]  It's an RFA FU.
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.200]  Yes, exactly.
[02:44.420 --> 02:47.120]  The very rare, rarely used RFA FU.
[02:47.440 --> 02:48.000]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:48.100 --> 02:52.360]  Well, I think they view all RFA FUs as like that's always an FU.
[02:52.680 --> 02:54.900]  There's no I don't think there's been one that isn't an FU.
[02:55.300 --> 02:55.760]  That's fair.
[02:56.280 --> 02:57.680]  That was what I wanted to talk about.
[02:57.780 --> 02:59.140]  I don't know if that's I didn't listen.
[02:59.220 --> 03:01.540]  Was that one of your five things you have written down?
[03:01.920 --> 03:03.540]  Why do you think I have five things written down?
[03:03.540 --> 03:06.580]  Didn't you earlier say you had five bullet points to talk about?
[03:07.040 --> 03:08.400]  No, I never said that.
[03:08.500 --> 03:09.340]  Did you have five?
[03:09.760 --> 03:10.820]  I don't know. I haven't counted.
[03:10.920 --> 03:13.260]  I could have sworn when I came in before we started the podcast.
[03:13.320 --> 03:15.520]  I heard you say I have five things on my list to talk about today.
[03:15.720 --> 03:17.620]  No, I never said that.
[03:18.500 --> 03:19.940]  Where did I hear that then?
[03:20.240 --> 03:20.900]  I have no idea.
[03:21.040 --> 03:22.140]  Eric, could Eric back me up?
[03:22.220 --> 03:22.700]  Eric was here.
[03:23.300 --> 03:24.320]  Eric's been here since the beginning.
[03:24.800 --> 03:26.020]  Nick is backing up Geoff.
[03:26.360 --> 03:27.000]  Oh, Nick is?
[03:27.280 --> 03:29.600]  I don't remember Andrew saying that he had five things,
[03:29.760 --> 03:30.980]  but for the sake of content.
[03:30.980 --> 03:33.700]  Yeah, Andrew, you said that you had five things written down.
[03:34.020 --> 03:38.340]  Well, Nick hasn't recorded five things like you went to Scotland recently.
[03:38.780 --> 03:40.100]  Thank you. I knew it, Nick.
[03:40.180 --> 03:42.920]  Nick, Nick says I have five bullet points ellipses.
[03:43.080 --> 03:44.440]  I knew it. I knew it.
[03:44.460 --> 03:45.560]  You definitely said that.
[03:45.740 --> 03:48.660]  I never I never said I have five bullet points.
[03:48.800 --> 03:50.160]  That is not a thing I would say.
[03:50.260 --> 03:51.560]  It feels unnatural to say now.
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.040]  I don't think that's the thing I would say.
[03:53.120 --> 03:54.660]  I said I have five bullets.
[03:54.800 --> 03:55.980]  You said you have five bullets.
[03:56.340 --> 03:57.840]  You did say that you have five bullets.
[03:58.580 --> 03:59.640]  That was my betting.
[03:59.640 --> 04:02.340]  Yeah, that's that's not conversational.
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.980]  I have five bullets for betting.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.440]  Oh, that's where the misunderstanding was.
[04:06.600 --> 04:08.520]  You know, the common phrase, I have five bullets.
[04:08.520 --> 04:09.640]  I got five. I got five bullets.
[04:09.840 --> 04:11.540]  I do. That's how I view it.
[04:11.640 --> 04:13.700]  I'm going to probably miss all five, but it's fine.
[04:13.940 --> 04:15.180]  It's a risky game of Russian roulette.
[04:15.760 --> 04:16.240]  Is it?
[04:16.980 --> 04:18.160]  Yeah, if you got five in the chamber.
[04:18.540 --> 04:20.320]  Well, it depends how many guns you're playing with.
[04:22.440 --> 04:24.960]  If I'm playing with 20 guns, it's a pretty good chance.
[04:25.280 --> 04:25.760]  Good odds.
[04:28.040 --> 04:29.580]  Wow, that turned around on me.
[04:29.700 --> 04:29.940]  I'm impressed.
[04:30.800 --> 04:31.200]  Yeah.
[04:32.700 --> 04:33.640]  Welcome home, buddy.
[04:33.740 --> 04:35.040]  I've missed you so much.
[04:35.060 --> 04:36.360]  Don't ever leave me again.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.140]  I've heard that you went jet skiing without me.
[04:39.580 --> 04:40.560]  I well, I had to.
[04:40.880 --> 04:41.800]  What am I going to do?
[04:41.820 --> 04:42.480]  You're not in town.
[04:43.300 --> 04:45.320]  I do have a funny little story about that.
[04:45.400 --> 04:47.900]  And that is the thing we should talk about is between the time.
[04:48.060 --> 04:49.940]  How long has it been since we recorded, by the way?
[04:50.000 --> 04:50.640]  Three weeks.
[04:50.980 --> 04:52.780]  It might as well be 15 years.
[04:53.220 --> 04:55.020]  It feels like over a month, but I guess.
[04:55.100 --> 04:55.300]  Yeah.
[04:55.680 --> 04:58.160]  It's been the longest three weeks of my life.
[04:58.180 --> 04:59.840]  And I made a point of...
[04:59.840 --> 05:03.100]  Because I knew, Gavin, I knew you were going home to visit your family.
[05:03.260 --> 05:03.940]  And I wanted...
[05:03.940 --> 05:04.240]  I don't know.
[05:04.300 --> 05:05.500]  I don't want to like...
[05:05.500 --> 05:06.740]  I don't want to bug you with America.
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.220]  So I haven't talked to you at all in three weeks.
[05:09.220 --> 05:09.340]  It's true.
[05:09.620 --> 05:10.540]  You wanted time.
[05:10.680 --> 05:14.700]  I wanted you to have like unfiltered time with your family and your friends from England
[05:14.700 --> 05:17.100]  and not be reminded of all the dumbassery.
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.100]  Well, you did check in once and that was very nice.
[05:19.220 --> 05:20.520]  But just the one time.
[05:20.680 --> 05:22.040]  Yeah, I just said, hey, I hope you're doing well.
[05:22.100 --> 05:22.780]  I don't want to bother you.
[05:22.960 --> 05:23.040]  Yeah.
[05:23.120 --> 05:23.740]  Yeah, I did.
[05:23.740 --> 05:25.360]  But I wanted you to know I was thinking about you.
[05:25.960 --> 05:26.800]  It was very nice.
[05:27.040 --> 05:28.060]  How was your vacation, man?
[05:28.460 --> 05:29.180]  Oh, it was so good.
[05:29.240 --> 05:30.380]  It was so nice to see the fam.
[05:30.700 --> 05:30.780]  Yeah.
[05:30.780 --> 05:31.740]  And now I feel very refreshed.
[05:32.060 --> 05:36.180]  I feel like being away from content and being away from being able to make it, like physically
[05:36.180 --> 05:40.140]  being blocked from making content, spurs a lot of creative thoughts.
[05:40.340 --> 05:42.040]  So I feel very nicely refreshed.
[05:42.360 --> 05:43.720]  Dude, I'm glad to hear that.
[05:43.840 --> 05:48.340]  I don't want to speak for Andrew, but I feel like he and I have both been kind of pulling
[05:48.340 --> 05:51.600]  our hair out because there's so much to talk about.
[05:51.600 --> 05:54.720]  And we keep having ideas and things we want to dive into.
[05:54.880 --> 05:56.020]  And we just haven't been able to.
[05:56.080 --> 05:58.740]  And I've been like itching to get to this fucking podcast.
[05:58.800 --> 05:59.520]  I don't know about you, Andrew.
[06:00.320 --> 06:03.100]  It's a really weird thing where I almost have...
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.560]  I don't know how to describe it, really.
[06:04.640 --> 06:06.240]  It's like there's so much to talk about.
[06:06.320 --> 06:08.120]  I'm scared we won't talk about any of it.
[06:08.400 --> 06:09.200]  Like there's so much.
[06:09.240 --> 06:11.720]  I don't know how to sort through what we should talk about.
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.420]  And in my head, there's a fear of there's actually nothing to talk about because there's so much
[06:15.420 --> 06:16.040]  to talk about.
[06:16.060 --> 06:17.580]  You're paralyzed by options.
[06:17.880 --> 06:18.060]  Yeah.
[06:18.340 --> 06:21.160]  You're wasting all of this time you could be talking about it by worrying about whether
[06:21.160 --> 06:22.480]  or not you're going to talk about it.
[06:22.620 --> 06:23.440]  Well, yeah.
[06:23.520 --> 06:27.740]  I mean, we're starting now, but I'm saying leading into this podcast, I had nerves going
[06:27.740 --> 06:28.400]  into this one.
[06:28.520 --> 06:31.820]  I haven't had like real anxiety about doing this show in quite a while.
[06:32.060 --> 06:35.820]  And I was just sitting constantly thinking, do we have too much to talk about?
[06:35.980 --> 06:36.180]  Yeah.
[06:36.260 --> 06:37.580]  In a sense that we won't cover any.
[06:37.780 --> 06:39.620]  I think there are two things.
[06:39.880 --> 06:41.400]  There are two things we could talk about.
[06:41.460 --> 06:45.520]  Two major things that Andrew and I have been talking about that are entire episodes by
[06:45.520 --> 06:46.080]  themselves.
[06:46.600 --> 06:46.800]  OK.
[06:46.880 --> 06:48.500]  And then I have a bunch of stuff written down.
[06:49.140 --> 06:50.560]  Andrew, you have your five bullets.
[06:51.280 --> 06:55.280]  And then Gavin, I assume you with all of the creative juices, you've got a ton you want
[06:55.280 --> 06:55.780]  to talk about.
[06:56.020 --> 06:57.940]  So I actually have five.
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.260]  I have five bullet points.
[06:59.540 --> 07:00.920]  You have five bullet points?
[07:02.120 --> 07:02.620]  Let's go.
[07:02.760 --> 07:03.360]  How many guns do you have?
[07:03.460 --> 07:04.180]  Let's hear number one.
[07:04.780 --> 07:05.880]  Oh, I feel like I need to.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.120]  Oh, OK.
[07:10.700 --> 07:13.780]  I didn't mean to put you on the spot by responding to the thing you said.
[07:14.040 --> 07:16.940]  I got really annoyed when I found this out.
[07:16.980 --> 07:17.160]  OK.
[07:17.160 --> 07:21.320]  How many episodes of the Jerry Springer show did they make?
[07:21.840 --> 07:22.160]  700.
[07:23.320 --> 07:26.000]  Oh, no, it's going to be way more than 700.
[07:26.360 --> 07:30.800]  That thing, I feel like, yeah, I'm going to say, I'm going to say 5,000 episodes.
[07:31.440 --> 07:32.620]  Oh, my God, Andrew.
[07:33.040 --> 07:36.980]  They made 4,969 episodes.
[07:37.280 --> 07:37.920]  Pretty good.
[07:38.380 --> 07:41.140]  But why didn't they just stop at 5,000?
[07:41.260 --> 07:42.000]  It's insanity.
[07:42.300 --> 07:44.620]  I read that and got really annoyed at the Jerry Springer show.
[07:44.620 --> 07:47.680]  I mean, it was a terrible, shitty show for decades.
[07:48.880 --> 07:54.020]  But why didn't they just finish out a nice round 5,000 shows and then stop?
[07:54.200 --> 07:57.280]  They're going to stop like 30 episodes short?
[07:57.540 --> 07:57.920]  Mental.
[07:58.380 --> 08:01.520]  Is there a 5,000 club that they could have joined?
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.840]  I bet there is.
[08:04.380 --> 08:05.860]  There's got to be a 5,000 club.
[08:06.280 --> 08:12.760]  I feel like he stopped because it just probably was like all his soul that could take, like all of his soul was gone at that point.
[08:12.760 --> 08:14.920]  Like he's just morally beaten down.
[08:15.060 --> 08:17.120]  Like people were probably saying, like, we could get the 5,000.
[08:17.220 --> 08:17.720]  We're so close.
[08:17.800 --> 08:18.640]  It's such a great number.
[08:18.780 --> 08:20.420]  And he's just like, I can't do it anymore.
[08:20.760 --> 08:22.240]  There's only so much I can handle.
[08:22.560 --> 08:28.320]  He probably just felt morally bankrupt about profiting off the people on the poverty line for 20 years.
[08:28.700 --> 08:39.300]  Or he woke up every morning and rolled through his mansion of money to his car and thought, why the fuck am I getting in the car and going to work when I don't have any room for all the money that I have?
[08:41.260 --> 08:45.420]  I... do you think it was sort of like... and I didn't watch the Springer show regularly.
[08:45.660 --> 08:48.960]  I feel like it's sort of the same episode every single time.
[08:49.300 --> 08:52.280]  Is it like living in a Groundhog Day scenario?
[08:52.460 --> 08:53.300]  Do you think making that show?
[08:53.320 --> 08:54.040]  Yeah, I bet he's...
[08:54.040 --> 08:54.880]  Maybe that could have been a loop.
[08:55.240 --> 09:01.220]  He must have said someone's name and then watched that person walk out and slap the shit out of someone sat in a chair.
[09:01.880 --> 09:02.980]  A thousand times?
[09:03.320 --> 09:04.180]  How often did that happen?
[09:04.320 --> 09:05.160]  It seems like it was...
[09:05.160 --> 09:06.540]  It feels like that's all that show...
[09:06.540 --> 09:11.180]  It would be like if somebody just walked into this show and said, what's a condiment, and left, and that was their job.
[09:11.300 --> 09:14.220]  Like, it was just their instigating for no reason.
[09:15.560 --> 09:16.660]  That's all they have to say.
[09:17.140 --> 09:18.160]  That was what he did.
[09:18.200 --> 09:22.220]  All he did was instigate for 4,962 episodes of Chefs.
[09:22.400 --> 09:23.280]  An impressive run.
[09:23.660 --> 09:26.240]  He also gave his, like, his final thoughts.
[09:26.680 --> 09:31.480]  You know, where he tied it all together and taught a moral lesson at the end.
[09:31.700 --> 09:36.140]  You know, where he just sits there on his chair as, like, director's chair and addresses the audience.
[09:36.140 --> 09:44.920]  I wonder if, with 5,000 episodes to look through, almost, could you base your life on only Jerry Springer's final thoughts?
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.280]  Could you just take all of his values and base a living around it?
[09:49.720 --> 09:52.320]  If Jerry Springer didn't mention it, you can't do it.
[09:52.620 --> 09:55.200]  I'm guessing that there's probably a book.
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.280]  I bet there's a Jerry Springer, like, my thoughts book that you could use as, like, a thought bible for that purpose.
[10:02.280 --> 10:04.280]  I want, like, an episode breakdown book.
[10:04.280 --> 10:08.980]  Like, it's just a fully, every episode written down and him giving little notes about each show.
[10:09.440 --> 10:12.720]  Just a giant encyclopedia-sized thing of trash.
[10:13.100 --> 10:18.420]  Hey, man, I don't know if you've checked the trash lately, but Eric's got some conflicting information he's posted.
[10:18.800 --> 10:20.680]  Interesting. Guiding Light, 15,000 episodes.
[10:20.860 --> 10:22.120]  Oprah Winfrey Show, 4,500.
[10:22.440 --> 10:25.440]  Jerry Springer Show, 5,084.
[10:25.920 --> 10:26.340]  Interesting.
[10:26.620 --> 10:32.000]  Because on the Jerry Springer Show Wikipedia page, it's listed as 4,969.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.740]  I wonder if they roll in some of the Steve Show in that, potentially.
[10:36.360 --> 10:37.360]  What's the Steve Show?
[10:37.460 --> 10:40.000]  Well, you know that cop that was, like, the security guy?
[10:40.680 --> 10:40.840]  Yeah.
[10:40.900 --> 10:45.240]  They spun him off into his own show produced by the same company that was-
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.720]  Wait, the security guy was a cop?
[10:47.080 --> 10:49.500]  He was a retired Chicago police officer.
[10:49.700 --> 10:49.900]  Yeah.
[10:50.360 --> 10:52.980]  Shouldn't he have just arrested everyone that came out and-
[10:52.980 --> 10:56.280]  Well, I think he was retired at that point.
[10:56.580 --> 10:59.580]  But yeah, he eventually, I don't remember his last name, but he eventually had his own show.
[11:00.480 --> 11:02.040]  Steve from Jerry Springer.
[11:02.980 --> 11:03.000]  Interesting.
[11:03.320 --> 11:03.760]  Did that-
[11:03.760 --> 11:07.240]  What was, like, the most escalated thing that happened on that show?
[11:07.760 --> 11:10.000]  Like, remember how the host of Cheaters got stabbed?
[11:10.080 --> 11:11.520]  I think that was fake, but-
[11:11.520 --> 11:12.000]  Steve Wilkos.
[11:12.240 --> 11:14.200]  Did Jerry Springer ever get stabbed?
[11:14.320 --> 11:17.060]  Like, what's the closest to an escalation?
[11:17.060 --> 11:17.660]  I don't think he got stabbed.
[11:17.780 --> 11:19.020]  I think, uh, what was it?
[11:19.060 --> 11:21.520]  Geraldo got his nose caved in by a chair.
[11:23.360 --> 11:23.720]  Yeah.
[11:25.280 --> 11:26.140]  What happened to-
[11:26.140 --> 11:28.700]  What, like, somebody threw a chair at him or hit him with a chair?
[11:29.100 --> 11:30.600]  It was just, like, a big brawl.
[11:30.780 --> 11:35.780]  I think there may have been some white supremacists involved and someone chucked a chair or something.
[11:36.540 --> 11:37.020]  Interesting.
[11:37.700 --> 11:39.360]  Interesting times for television.
[11:40.200 --> 11:46.300]  Dude, and before that, you know, like, that was that generation's version of that show.
[11:46.800 --> 11:53.580]  Before that, there was a guy named Morton Downey Jr. who was, like, the prototype for what Jerry Springer became.
[11:53.820 --> 11:56.260]  And I think the Morton Downey Jr. show was actually more hardcore.
[11:56.700 --> 12:00.980]  Is there just, like, a large percentage of Downey Juniors?
[12:02.100 --> 12:07.060]  You don't hear a lot of juniors, but if your surname is Downey, it's likely that there'll be a junior.
[12:07.520 --> 12:08.180]  I think it's a requirement.
[12:08.440 --> 12:08.580]  Yeah.
[12:08.760 --> 12:09.000]  Yeah.
[12:09.400 --> 12:11.300]  You know, I never thought about that, but you are right.
[12:11.660 --> 12:13.480]  I don't know a lot of other multiple juniors.
[12:14.040 --> 12:14.540]  I don't either.
[12:15.040 --> 12:15.900]  Yeah, I can't name any.
[12:16.200 --> 12:17.520]  Maybe the comment leavers have some.
[12:17.860 --> 12:18.120]  Yeah.
[12:18.380 --> 12:18.880]  That come to mind.
[12:19.820 --> 12:22.840]  Alright, well, that was one bullet point down. Gavin, what's next?
[12:23.260 --> 12:24.600]  No, I'm passing it over to you guys.
[12:25.080 --> 12:30.380]  Okay, I got a bullet point. I got a Gavin bullet point that I feel like this is a thing we talked about.
[12:30.480 --> 12:32.740]  I learned about this last night. This is very exciting.
[12:33.360 --> 12:36.160]  I don't know how many... I have a feeling that a lot of people know this.
[12:36.280 --> 12:37.240]  I did not realize this.
[12:37.380 --> 12:40.180]  At one point, Gavin, I feel like you asked me,
[12:40.860 --> 12:43.120]  what is the most common thing I don't know?
[12:43.260 --> 12:44.720]  Or, like, what is the most...
[12:44.720 --> 12:44.980]  Yeah.
[12:45.280 --> 12:45.360]  Yeah.
[12:45.760 --> 12:48.820]  Yeah, I learned last night. I had no idea that this was a thing.
[12:49.180 --> 12:49.840]  I'm so excited.
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.320]  Hold down shift. If you hold shift down, it capitalizes your letters.
[12:54.940 --> 12:55.760]  I had no idea.
[12:56.820 --> 12:59.060]  Oh, I thought you were going to go...
[12:59.060 --> 13:01.420]  That, right, that one is mental.
[13:01.880 --> 13:05.240]  I had no idea. I've been caps-locking my whole life.
[13:05.500 --> 13:09.340]  You've been caps-locking a single letter at a time and then un-caps-locking?
[13:09.620 --> 13:11.660]  Every time. Yeah, I would have issues sometimes.
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.180]  One of my biggest annoyances is when, because I don't look when I type,
[13:16.180 --> 13:19.960]  is if I screw up the caps-lock combination where I make all the little letters big
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.140]  and the big letters small because I'm caps-locking.
[13:22.220 --> 13:23.920]  Yeah, I had no idea. I didn't know you could do that with shift.
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.780]  But when you're typing on a phone and you put, like, a full stop,
[13:28.200 --> 13:32.000]  and then you start typing again, it automatically shifts to uppercase.
[13:32.400 --> 13:35.500]  Like, what did you think that was doing? The shift, like, lights up.
[13:35.920 --> 13:39.480]  I just assumed that, like, it knew first letter of the sentence,
[13:39.540 --> 13:44.860]  like, once I put a period, that it would then just automatically capitalize for you.
[13:44.860 --> 13:47.840]  Like, I never paid attention to the function on the keyboard.
[13:48.260 --> 13:52.440]  I also don't know if that's true. So how did you get to the symbols?
[13:52.920 --> 13:55.820]  You were shifting numbers to get symbols, right?
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.920]  Yeah, I shift for symbols, but that's all I use the shift for.
[14:00.040 --> 14:02.760]  I'm not a big shift user. I don't use the shift regularly.
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.500]  But you shift for symbols, and every time you hit the shift key for symbols,
[14:06.620 --> 14:08.860]  it changes everything to caps. You never noticed that?
[14:09.220 --> 14:11.200]  I don't know what that means. I don't know what you're saying.
[14:12.740 --> 14:15.340]  I've never tried to type in a letter while holding shift.
[14:16.140 --> 14:16.500]  Never?
[14:17.700 --> 14:21.940]  If I'm putting a symbol in, I'm holding the shift for the symbol, then releasing the shift.
[14:22.260 --> 14:25.920]  The reason I had, like, kind of a flat reaction to that, I thought that it was gonna continue.
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.120]  Like, did you know that if you held shift and pressed X or whatever, that this happened?
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.540]  Yeah. You just ended it, if you held shift, it capitalized the letter.
[14:34.540 --> 14:37.440]  Yeah, I didn't know. You're basically, you just ended it with, like, did you guys know shift?
[14:37.920 --> 14:42.340]  Yeah! How? I just didn't...
[14:42.340 --> 14:46.520]  I didn't know. I think Eric even taught me that shift is how you drop down
[14:46.520 --> 14:50.180]  without hitting submit. Like, if you hold shift and enter, it'll drop down on the thing.
[14:50.260 --> 14:54.780]  I didn't know that. I never hit shift outside of making symbols. Shift is the symbol key to me.
[14:55.280 --> 14:57.860]  I felt dumb the other day because
[14:57.860 --> 15:02.140]  my girlfriend taught me that if you hold the space bar down on your iPhone when you're typing,
[15:02.460 --> 15:06.500]  you can then move your cursor to anywhere within the text, so you can edit.
[15:07.060 --> 15:10.960]  And I thought, how have I been doing this wrong all these years? How much of my life
[15:10.960 --> 15:14.800]  have I wasted on my iPhone trying to, like, precisely
[15:14.800 --> 15:18.980]  get to where I needed to fix a letter? And you just made me feel, like,
[15:19.020 --> 15:23.420]  I felt so dumb. You've made me feel so much smarter. I really, I gotta thank you, actually.
[15:23.960 --> 15:27.160]  I just wasn't aware. I don't know if it's a dumb thing. I just didn't know.
[15:27.260 --> 15:30.640]  Nobody told me. I missed that. Well, who taught you keyboard?
[15:31.320 --> 15:33.940]  That was in school. I was taught how to type in school.
[15:34.430 --> 15:38.480]  I would love to see the first time you typed, and I bet it was
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.660]  something as simple as... I bet it was a classic butterfly flapping its wings
[15:42.660 --> 15:46.720]  out a window, and you just zoned out for, like, six seconds, looked at a
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.760]  butterfly, and then didn't hear the shift bit. And then you lived the rest of your life
[15:51.680 --> 15:54.580]  incredibly inefficiently. I bet this is exactly like how
[15:54.580 --> 15:58.580]  I switched math classes in the third grade for one week, and I missed Roman Numerals,
[15:58.660 --> 16:02.560]  and now, you know, 46 years into my life, I still don't know Roman Numerals. I bet you
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.820]  called in sick that day, maybe you had a tummy ache or whatever on shift day,
[16:06.880 --> 16:09.740]  and you were just fucked for the rest of your life. That's actually not your fault.
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.820]  I feel bad for you. I missed the first two lessons of French that I had,
[16:15.040 --> 16:18.600]  so I missed Numbers and Letters. Absolutely screwed me for the
[16:18.600 --> 16:21.080]  whole year I did French. I don't know anything.
[16:23.400 --> 16:26.100]  Those are the two keys to French, Numbers and Letters.
[16:37.190 --> 16:41.430]  You keep your baggage at the airport without a lock. You think your stuff is kept private,
[16:41.790 --> 16:45.010]  but you never know who's going through your
[16:45.010 --> 16:49.250]  underwear or your online receipts to see what kind of
[16:49.250 --> 16:53.110]  collectible items you've been buying. Maybe it's in the spoon or
[16:53.110 --> 16:57.290]  thimble realm. I wouldn't know if it was me, though,
[16:57.530 --> 17:00.410]  because I keep that shit locked down with ExpressVPN.
[17:01.230 --> 17:05.310]  When you go online without a VPN, internet service providers can see
[17:05.310 --> 17:09.030]  every single spoon you look at and browse.
[17:09.190 --> 17:12.950]  They can legally sell your thimble shopping information
[17:12.950 --> 17:16.850]  without your consent to ad companies or tech giants or
[17:16.850 --> 17:21.130]  unscrupulous thimble dealers who then use that data to target
[17:21.130 --> 17:24.790]  you. Browse more anonymously with your ExpressVPN so
[17:24.790 --> 17:29.030]  ISPs can't see this incredibly important private online activity.
[17:29.150 --> 17:33.170]  Your data is anonymized by a secure VPN server, so it could be
[17:33.170 --> 17:36.630]  spoons, it could be dog houses, maybe you're buying
[17:37.630 --> 17:41.230]  fideitonaceous dirt. I don't know. Neither do they, because your data
[17:41.230 --> 17:45.230]  is encrypted for maximum protection. It's also easy to use. So fire
[17:45.230 --> 17:49.030]  up the app and click one button. And it works on phones, laptops,
[17:49.170 --> 17:52.870]  even routers, so everybody on your Wi-Fi can be protected.
[17:53.110 --> 17:57.230]  You know why it's important to me? Because I got stuff I'm buying and I don't want you to know
[17:57.230 --> 18:01.230]  about it. It's a cutthroat, dog-eat-dog-world collectible
[18:01.230 --> 18:05.070]  spoon market out there, and I cannot have my data,
[18:05.170 --> 18:09.230]  I cannot have the intricacies of the wheeling and the dealing
[18:09.230 --> 18:13.010]  that I do on the spoon market. I can't have it leaked, I can't have it out there,
[18:13.030 --> 18:17.170]  I can't have people seeing it. These are trade secrets that I have in terms of
[18:17.170 --> 18:21.270]  buying low and selling high. And it's none of your business, it is mine. That's why you should

[18:49.890 --> 18:53.150]  Hey bud, it's me, Geoff. I'm here to talk to you about toilets.
[18:53.610 --> 18:57.010]  And toilet accessories. That's right, it's the tushy modern
[18:57.010 --> 19:01.130]  bidet attachment. You have heard us here at F*** Face talk about our
[19:01.130 --> 19:04.690]  bidets ad nauseum. And I'll tell you why. It's because we're
[19:04.690 --> 19:08.450]  bidet believers. It's because we're sold on the concept.
[19:09.210 --> 19:12.890]  We like to wash away the messiest poops and leave our
[19:12.890 --> 19:17.190]  little buttholes pristine and clean and ready to go.
[19:17.710 --> 19:20.690]  Is your butt clean enough to sit on a couch naked? Mine is.
[19:20.970 --> 19:25.030]  Go get it! As a matter of fact, I didn't used to sleep naked, and now that I have a tushy
[19:25.030 --> 19:29.170]  I used to sleep in underwear. Or like jammy pants. But now that I have
[19:29.170 --> 19:33.170]  a bidet, I sleep in the nude. I sleep commando.
[19:33.410 --> 19:36.990]  And I don't worry at all that I'm gonna wake up covered in filth.
[19:37.110 --> 19:41.030]  Because I don't. It doesn't happen. Because I know that when I use my bidet
[19:41.030 --> 19:44.930]  and I put my little head on that pillow and my little
[19:44.930 --> 19:49.170]  butt cheeks on the bed, I'm gonna sleep sound and wake up
[19:49.170 --> 19:52.990]  clean. All thanks to TUSHY, the modern bidet
[19:52.990 --> 19:56.830]  for people who poop. Just poop, wash, and pat dry.
[19:57.210 --> 20:01.110]  But don't trust my word for it. Trust my word for it. It washes your
[20:01.110 --> 20:04.890]  bum with water, which makes it infinitely cleaner than toilet paper
[20:04.890 --> 20:08.870]  and there's no little residue, as it were. It's less
[20:08.870 --> 20:12.750]  irritating to wash with water and it's super soothing for your butthole. It's like a little butthole
[20:12.750 --> 20:17.110]  massage. Every time. It's like a little water butt massage. It's easy to install and attaches
[20:17.110 --> 20:20.670]  to your toilet in under 10 minutes without electricity or plumbing needed.
[20:20.670 --> 20:23.950]  Thanks, because I'm not an electrician and I'm definitely not a plumber.
[20:24.610 --> 20:28.530]  And using a TUSHY bidet reduces your toilet paper usage by
[20:29.130 --> 20:32.870]  80%. And that saves you money and it means it's eco-friendly
[20:32.870 --> 20:36.250]  and hey, it's stylish to boot. We don't have to live ugly.

[20:58.730 --> 21:02.970]  You weren't there for the last break shit we did, Gavin. I felt
[21:03.630 --> 21:06.990]  incredibly stupid because we were opening football cards and
[21:07.570 --> 21:10.550]  either Geoff or Eric, I think Geoff said, what's LVI?
[21:10.870 --> 21:15.250]  And he meant Roman numerals. In my head, I was thinking like MVP, like it stood for
[21:15.250 --> 21:19.030]  something. So it was like least valuable information
[21:19.030 --> 21:22.530]  or like I replied it in a weird sense. It's Roman
[21:23.970 --> 21:25.750]  numerals. Is L50?
[21:27.350 --> 21:31.070]  Yes. Was that 56 LVI? I don't know.
[21:31.370 --> 21:34.590]  I have no idea. I know it's not least valuable information.
[21:35.030 --> 21:39.290]  We covered it in the break show, which by the way, we did a break show without you. It wasn't
[21:39.290 --> 21:43.310]  the same without you. We missed you, but it was still a fun time. We did. Well, I'll be there for the next one.
[21:43.310 --> 21:47.010]  You also could have waited two days and I would have been back, but that's fine. Well,
[21:47.890 --> 21:51.270]  we couldn't. Which we should get to at some point.
[21:51.430 --> 21:55.310]  One of the things we need to talk about is from that break show and it includes you whether you want
[21:55.310 --> 21:58.730]  it to or not. Okay. We picked for you. I hate
[21:59.250 --> 22:03.270]  his pick and I hate what has transpired since his pick. He doesn't know
[22:03.270 --> 22:07.350]  about it. He's going to win. Gavin has no idea. It's the most Gavin thing of all time.
[22:07.870 --> 22:11.270]  Everyone's been asking me about this. Jack's like, oh, what's this stuff about
[22:11.270 --> 22:15.350]  this bet? And Eric was asking me something about it yesterday. I don't know what anyone is talking
[22:15.350 --> 22:19.190]  about. And it's weird that I'm involved. So what's what's happened? Here's what I'm going to do for you.
[22:19.270 --> 22:23.210]  I'm going to go to Vegas in a couple of weeks and I'm going to place
[22:23.210 --> 22:27.290]  my bet and I'm going to place your bet for you as well, just so that you get taken
[22:27.290 --> 22:31.310]  care of. But I'm not going to Vegas. I mean, you can go to Vegas if you want to, but I'm just saying
[22:31.310 --> 22:35.370]  if you don't, I'm going to already be there. So I'll place your bet for you if you need. We should probably
[22:35.370 --> 22:39.270]  explain everything so he knows what we're talking about. Explain something. Explain
[22:39.270 --> 22:43.590]  anything. If we do, this is the rest of the episode. You think so?
[22:43.770 --> 22:47.330]  I don't know, man. Maybe. Yeah, let's
[22:47.330 --> 22:51.010]  fuck it. Let's do it. Let's go for it. Andrew, this is you. Okay, so
[22:51.010 --> 22:55.090]  Geoff and I talked about in the past before, even before
[22:55.090 --> 22:58.790]  F*** Face, doing this idea where we were going to use spells
[22:59.310 --> 23:03.090]  on NBA players and then make bets based off of the spells
[23:03.090 --> 23:07.170]  that we sent towards the players. There are different versions of this idea. We're at one point
[23:07.170 --> 23:11.150]  going to have a sorcery battle between the Wizards and the Magic, which are two different NBA
[23:11.150 --> 23:15.210]  teams. Have a battle of magic between them. This feels
[23:15.210 --> 23:18.790]  like French again. I feel like I've missed the letters and the numbers. What the hell are you talking about?
[23:18.990 --> 23:22.970]  There's an NBA team called the Wizards. There's an NBA team called the Orlando Magic.
[23:23.070 --> 23:27.150]  We think it's funny that they both had magic-based names, so we thought
[23:27.150 --> 23:30.930]  what if we hired voodoo practitioners
[23:30.930 --> 23:35.170]  and magicians and brujeria people
[23:35.170 --> 23:39.030]  and we had them place spells and curses
[23:39.030 --> 23:42.990]  on players. Well, at different times it
[23:42.990 --> 23:47.170]  definitely leaned into the curse. We've posited
[23:47.170 --> 23:51.270]  it up because we don't want to get sued. But we definitely had a
[23:51.270 --> 23:55.190]  period where we were going to hex players and s*** and see if we could affect the outcome of the game.
[23:55.530 --> 23:58.410]  Andrew would be one of the teams, I'd be the other, and we would duel with magic.
[23:58.810 --> 24:02.990]  The origin of this thought was, I was thinking about how when athletes
[24:02.990 --> 24:06.950]  are successful in things, whether it be, you hear it a lot in combat sports, but you hear it
[24:06.950 --> 24:11.190]  in all sports, they'll be like, I want to thank God or Jesus for that.
[24:11.710 --> 24:14.750]  And then I thought, I've never heard a player on the losing side say
[24:14.750 --> 24:19.130]  they had God on their side. Like, Jesus blocked my three-point attempt. I don't know what you want from me.
[24:19.270 --> 24:22.210]  I made a great shot. Oh, you're saying they only thanked God and Jesus.
[24:22.350 --> 24:26.990]  Nobody blames Jesus for their loss. Only people support
[24:26.990 --> 24:29.090]  and like, I want to thank God for this knockout.
[24:29.090 --> 24:33.650]  It's like, God had a role in me getting knocked out, what am I supposed to do about that?
[24:33.750 --> 24:37.130]  What the hell was Jesus back there? God gets all of the
[24:37.130 --> 24:41.070]  credit and none of the blame, and apparently if everybody does it
[24:41.070 --> 24:45.310]  for God, at least half of the people competing, God is betting against. That's an excellent
[24:45.310 --> 24:49.050]  way to look at it. Yeah, well that was the starting point, which then escalated to, I've
[24:49.050 --> 24:53.150]  never heard a player be like, I want to thank all the spells I cast on myself this off-season.
[24:53.330 --> 24:56.990]  Like, I didn't train, I did very little working out, I didn't practice, I just
[24:56.990 --> 25:00.090]  cast a bunch of magic on me, it's working out great. This is fantastic.
[25:00.470 --> 25:04.850]  It's like, I want to thank the hoodoo practitioner who placed
[25:04.850 --> 25:07.590]  the seven spells that helped me win.
[25:08.290 --> 25:13.090]  So we have escalated this to, the NFL season is about to start
[25:13.090 --> 25:16.290]  and we thought it would be great to pick rookies
[25:16.890 --> 25:20.630]  for winning Rookie of the Year. Make Rookie of the Year bets and then use magic
[25:20.630 --> 25:24.630]  on the people that we pick. Geoff was opening a box of
[25:24.630 --> 25:28.610]  college trading cards, which I greatly misunderstood what they were. I thought they'd
[25:28.610 --> 25:32.690]  all be college players from the previous season, not just a bunch of players that
[25:32.690 --> 25:36.870]  played in college. I thought that was a weird box, like the amount of players
[25:36.870 --> 25:40.430]  we got from the previous season. Yeah, that's how they all work, the collegiate
[25:40.430 --> 25:44.930]  packs. Yeah, it's unfortunate. But we got all these cards and we had
[25:44.930 --> 25:48.550]  essentially everybody that we wanted on this list
[25:48.550 --> 25:51.890]  and we drew a card for you, Gavin. So you have a horse in this race.
[25:51.890 --> 25:55.470]  Do I get a good one? Well, let's
[25:55.470 --> 25:59.970]  talk about that. So the one stipulation is it had
[25:59.970 --> 26:04.630]  to be an... what's the word I'm looking for?
[26:04.670 --> 26:07.950]  An underdog, right? It had to be somebody who's not slated
[26:07.950 --> 26:12.010]  to win Rookie of the Year. That's definitely Trevor Lawrence, so I can't remember the guy right behind him.
[26:13.070 --> 26:16.090]  So I picked a guy named Nigey Harris, who
[26:16.490 --> 26:19.970]  played at the University of Alabama, which is why I picked him. Andrew, who did you pick?
[26:19.970 --> 26:23.790]  I picked Justin Fields, who's a quarterback.
[26:24.170 --> 26:28.190]  And for you, Gavin, we picked another underdog. We picked a guy named
[26:28.190 --> 26:32.350]  Mac Jones, who was drafted by the Patriots
[26:32.350 --> 26:36.050]  to be potentially their new future quarterback.
[26:36.530 --> 26:40.190]  However, the Patriots had a very high
[26:40.190 --> 26:43.410]  profile quarterback step in after Tom Brady left.
[26:45.030 --> 26:48.070]  So Mac Jones, it didn't look like he was going to start
[26:48.070 --> 26:51.570]  or get a lot of playtime because this guy Cam Newton
[26:53.130 --> 26:56.250]  is like a world-class, or at times
[26:56.250 --> 27:00.330]  has been a world-class, like one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. Very talented
[27:00.330 --> 27:04.390]  dude. He's had some troubles the last few years. And then in a
[27:04.390 --> 27:07.810]  big, big, big surprise on Monday or Tuesday,
[27:08.030 --> 27:11.990]  they cut that dude, and Mac Jones is now the quarterback for the Patriots.
[27:12.110 --> 27:15.370]  So your rookie is now running the show, dude. I'm in.
[27:15.370 --> 27:18.790]  In the week since we picked, I think he was like the fifth
[27:19.310 --> 27:23.310]  most likely, like he was a pretty big underdog for winning rookie of the year. Since
[27:23.310 --> 27:27.190]  that time, he has now switched to be the favorite. Since the declaration.
[27:27.750 --> 27:31.410]  I don't know... I don't know what to say about that. Every time I read
[27:31.410 --> 27:35.390]  a story about a rookie, like the Jaguars had one of their rookies get hurt, and I was
[27:35.390 --> 27:39.350]  immediately suspicious that we have somehow caused this, that there is dark magic out there
[27:39.350 --> 27:45.350]  that people are using. I feel like people are sending spells to you. We're only using positive magic.
[27:45.350 --> 27:49.010]  You don't know what's going on out there. You have no control over that.
[27:49.910 --> 27:53.150]  Just imagining that Quidditch scene in the first Harry Potter movie.
[27:54.330 --> 27:57.750]  So congratulations, Gavin. Everything is coming up you right now.
[27:58.030 --> 28:01.270]  That's awesome. I'm so excited. I made a huge bet on Justin Fields,
[28:01.390 --> 28:04.870]  and then the next day, they're like, Mac Jones is starting for the Patriots.
[28:05.330 --> 28:09.010]  That's a good name too, Mac Jones. Also an Alabama alum, so you
[28:09.010 --> 28:12.230]  we're swimming in the same wake, which is nice. Alright.
[28:12.810 --> 28:16.330]  Now you just have to figure out what magic you're gonna do over the course of
[28:16.330 --> 28:20.430]  the next six months, five months, however long the NFL season is, to secure
[28:20.430 --> 28:24.310]  your Rookie of the Year victory. Or, you know, hire somebody.
[28:24.870 --> 28:28.310]  Yeah. Figure out someone who knows what they're doing. You live in Austin. There's a lot
[28:28.310 --> 28:30.090]  of magic in Austin, dude. I can take you to some places.
[28:31.530 --> 28:35.870]  I feel like I need to buy crystals. That's a thing, right? That's like a good...
[28:35.870 --> 28:39.510]  Oh yeah. That's a spell. Yeah. Crystals. There's a crystal store
[28:39.510 --> 28:42.850]  in Austin. The one that says this place rocks or something?
[28:43.150 --> 28:47.230]  Yeah, Nature's Treasures. It's like THE crystal and rock store, dude.
[28:47.310 --> 28:50.170]  It's huge! It's huge! And it's always packed.
[28:52.790 --> 28:55.650]  Can I... so if I go to a fortune teller, they can
[28:55.650 --> 28:59.650]  only tell my fortune, right? That's the deal with those? I think those are the rules.
[29:00.170 --> 29:03.470]  Is that true though? Is that like a governing rule? I think it might just depend
[29:03.470 --> 29:07.430]  on their abilities. Well, I think it has to be related to you somehow. You can't just ask about
[29:07.430 --> 29:11.670]  like the president's fortune. It's related to him
[29:11.670 --> 29:15.330]  now. I mean, he and Justin Fields are cosmically
[29:15.330 --> 29:19.390]  tied for the next few months. If I go to like six
[29:19.390 --> 29:23.610]  fortune tellers and ask who the rookie of the year is going to be for the upcoming
[29:23.610 --> 29:27.230]  NFL season, I wonder what will be said. That should have been a factor.
[29:27.470 --> 29:31.550]  I should have done more prep work. Are you going to give
[29:31.550 --> 29:34.730]  this person multiple choice or are they going to have to just pluck a name?
[29:34.730 --> 29:38.750]  They're going to have to tell me who's going to win. I'm not going to give them multiple choice. I want to see
[29:38.750 --> 29:42.830]  what the universe has to say. What are the chances that any one of them can give
[29:42.830 --> 29:46.050]  you a name of someone who even has anything to do with that sport?
[29:46.530 --> 29:50.790]  It's on them. You think it's going to be like an 8-ball thing
[29:50.790 --> 29:54.850]  where it's like my vision is blurry on this? I see a jersey
[29:54.850 --> 29:58.150]  the name's kind of blurry. I don't know who it is. I'm sorry. I can't help you.
[29:58.370 --> 29:59.750]  Someone who's going to wear a jersey.
[30:03.210 --> 30:05.290]  I should do that.
[30:05.670 --> 30:08.010]  Yeah, pay some scammers. Do it.
[30:08.450 --> 30:12.250]  It's within the spirit of the competition. I think you should.
[30:12.670 --> 30:17.250]  We should all explore all available options if we want to win this thing.
[30:17.510 --> 30:20.710]  The problem is actually I've already made a pretty big bet
[30:20.710 --> 30:24.770]  on Justin Fields winning. So I feel like if I spend money to learn
[30:24.770 --> 30:28.510]  that the opinion is not Justin Fields, then I've just wasted more money.
[30:29.170 --> 30:31.270]  Yeah, you've wasted money knowing
[30:31.270 --> 30:33.670]  or finding out that you've wasted money, basically.
[30:34.130 --> 30:37.310]  Hey Gav, real quick, can you just say Mac Jones?
[30:38.270 --> 30:39.510]  Is that good, Eric?
[30:41.950 --> 30:46.010]  If you want to give me another one, that's good. That's the whole reason I picked them for you.
[30:46.290 --> 30:52.330]  I just thought everyone has these other ones and Mac Jones feels like a very Gavin name for me.
[30:52.750 --> 30:54.870]  Wow, that was something. You want to try that again?
[30:57.430 --> 30:58.310]  Mac Jones.
[30:59.170 --> 31:01.130]  That's pretty good. I'm very impressed.
[31:02.590 --> 31:05.410]  It's like, wait, who said that? Gavin or Eric?
[31:06.730 --> 31:10.890]  I'm excited about me and Mac Jones. I think we'll go far.
[31:12.410 --> 31:14.950]  And hey, it's just so you. I like that
[31:14.950 --> 31:19.330]  when it comes to gambling, all you've ever done is fuck me and then you get Mac Jones
[31:19.330 --> 31:22.590]  and he's the starter the next day.
[31:22.590 --> 31:27.470]  I think the natural progression off of us breaking shit occasionally
[31:27.990 --> 31:30.370]  is, and I don't know the legality of this, I want
[31:30.370 --> 31:34.570]  an Andrew gambling show. I just want to watch you lose money.
[31:35.170 --> 31:38.430]  I think that's really good. Speaking of Andrew gambling
[31:38.430 --> 31:42.670]  and an Andrew gambling show, it's an excellent point for me to mention that I have my foot
[31:42.670 --> 31:47.010]  I'm using it as a footrest right now, is the mini roulette machine I bought for you guys.
[31:47.370 --> 31:51.270]  So that would be perfect for Andrew's gambling show.
[31:51.270 --> 31:54.890]  Andrew was sending me videos of people losing... was it Blackjack?
[31:55.290 --> 31:59.210]  Yeah, it was Blackjack. Fascinating. People just
[31:59.210 --> 32:03.670]  losing 10 grand in one go and their reactions to it. I think that would be great for Andrew.
[32:04.230 --> 32:07.490]  Here, I'll show you a thing I bought. Geoff, you bought the roulette wheel for us.
[32:07.510 --> 32:09.930]  Yes, I did. I went through a bad run.
[32:10.930 --> 32:15.150]  I no longer trust myself to make decisions. I've lost that right.
[32:15.230 --> 32:19.570]  I need to regain that privilege again. So I bought this.
[32:20.310 --> 32:23.610]  I've just been using this whenever I'm unsure on what I should do
[32:23.610 --> 32:27.230]  about something. A little bingo globe. Oh, it's pretty big.
[32:27.450 --> 32:29.290]  It's maybe bigger than it looks.
[32:30.610 --> 32:34.410]  I'll just be like...
[32:34.410 --> 32:39.770]  If I want to do something, I just assign numbers to it and then draw. That's how I make the choices
[32:39.770 --> 32:43.750]  now because I'm incapable. Are you ever like, how many chicken nuggets do I want today?
[32:44.270 --> 32:47.310]  Oh, 14. Okay. No, no, no, I don't do it like that.
[32:47.310 --> 32:51.490]  I'll be like, okay, I'm not sure. Do I want a 10 piece?
[32:51.590 --> 32:55.270]  Do I want a 20 piece? If it lands between 1 and 29, I'll get the 10.
[32:55.350 --> 32:58.870]  If it's above that, I'll go with the 20. I just have split everything.
[32:59.290 --> 33:03.130]  I'm terrible at making choices. I'll do the thing where I'll be on Netflix for hours
[33:03.130 --> 33:07.270]  just scrolling. No more. I'll have five movies on a list. I'll draw it from the machine.
[33:07.610 --> 33:10.650]  I've solved so many issues with my life because of this machine.
[33:10.770 --> 33:15.230]  Do you ever go against what the machine tells you? Never. You cannot go against
[33:15.230 --> 33:18.750]  the machine. It has one rule that you must obey the machine.
[33:19.090 --> 33:22.410]  At the point I disobey the machine, what am I even doing? There's no point.
[33:22.830 --> 33:26.650]  What decisions are you putting into this? Because surely not every decision.
[33:26.830 --> 33:31.610]  Some decisions you have to make yourself. No. It's like if I'm on the fence
[33:31.610 --> 33:35.430]  about something or if I want to do something but deep down
[33:35.430 --> 33:39.170]  I think actually that's a bad idea, then I go to the machine to see if it will validate
[33:39.170 --> 33:42.310]  my bad choice. So what was the most recent one? Yeah, there you go.
[33:42.310 --> 33:46.370]  The most recent one was deciding where I was going to order
[33:46.370 --> 33:49.810]  dinner from last night. It was the last time I used the machine. What were the options? I got Chinese.
[33:51.250 --> 33:53.730]  Chinese, pizza, I could have got sushi.
[33:54.310 --> 33:58.170]  I had a whole thing. I didn't know what I wanted so I used the machine. What number did you draw?
[33:58.670 --> 34:02.610]  17. Was it good? It was delicious. I got the fried rice.
[34:02.810 --> 34:04.570]  It was wonderful. Great time.
[34:07.170 --> 34:10.070]  Gavin, think of a number. Think of a number right now.
[34:10.070 --> 34:13.590]  1 and 60. There's 60 balls in this machine.
[34:14.610 --> 34:18.110]  Here's the thing. I think there are 60. When I moved it over there
[34:18.110 --> 34:21.490]  I made a mistake and all the balls fell onto the floor and shot everywhere
[34:22.050 --> 34:26.070]  and it's possible there are some behind my fridge. I do not know.
[34:26.690 --> 34:29.210]  I do not know if all 60 are in there at this point.
[34:30.550 --> 34:34.210]  You've misbalanced the decisions in your life because some balls fell onto the
[34:34.210 --> 34:37.830]  fridge. It was like a mistake where there were two balls
[34:37.830 --> 34:41.830]  in the chamber and I thought I can't get those out. I'll just lift the lid and put my
[34:41.830 --> 34:45.470]  hand in and it was tired. I wasn't thinking. I just lifted it and they all fell on the floor.
[34:45.670 --> 34:48.090]  How do you get them out through the top?
[34:48.410 --> 34:53.730]  They bounce into there and then the sensor above detects
[34:53.730 --> 34:55.470]  there's the ball and it stops spinning.
[34:58.130 --> 35:01.550]  Then I push the green button and a little panel
[35:01.550 --> 35:04.430]  moves and the ball drops down the chute and into the hole.
[35:05.390 --> 35:09.210]  That's how that works. Let's see how lucky this is.
[35:09.410 --> 35:10.710]  Do I tell you the number or what?
[35:12.330 --> 35:15.910]  I'm not sure. You think. You keep it in your head.
[35:17.130 --> 35:19.530]  It's also very loud. I'm going to warn you.
[35:19.710 --> 35:22.430]  Why don't I type it into Discord once you've pulled the number?
[35:23.170 --> 35:26.590]  I'm not going to be able to see my screen so I won't see your Discord post.
[35:28.410 --> 35:32.550]  I'm going to warn people. This is very loud. Also the machine is broken.
[35:32.550 --> 35:37.690]  Oh my god!
[35:37.890 --> 35:39.470]  Sounds like a wall falling down.
[35:42.280 --> 35:44.760]  We got a number? 43.
[35:46.540 --> 35:49.140]  That was close. What was it?
[35:49.640 --> 35:54.560]  54. That was actually pretty close. That was like my Springer fake number close.
[35:55.100 --> 35:57.540]  You know how there was that idea
[35:57.540 --> 36:02.020]  that we never followed through with where Andrew you could only grocery shop on in caps at the grocery store?
[36:02.020 --> 36:02.420]  Yes.
[36:06.140 --> 36:09.780]  That sounds great too. I think there's a lot we can do with this machine.
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.120]  I'm very excited about the possibilities. But in the short term, it might be funny
[36:14.120 --> 36:18.260]  for you just to take a week or a couple days where every decision in your life
[36:18.260 --> 36:21.700]  has to be made with that machine. Like what shirt do I put on today?
[36:21.800 --> 36:25.760]  I love the idea of gamifying your whole life. It's so funny.
[36:27.360 --> 36:30.480]  Before I bought the machine, Gavin and I had a conversation
[36:30.480 --> 36:34.460]  about making all your choices just be random. Not up to you.
[36:35.020 --> 36:36.620]  You have to draw a line on questions.
[36:38.100 --> 36:42.420]  Technically, you have to make a choice. You're making a choice in ways you don't
[36:42.420 --> 36:46.300]  necessarily just make. That's how we clarify that you're going to have to make some yourself.
[36:46.500 --> 36:50.360]  Because otherwise you could just say, oh, should I record f***face today? And then suddenly you don't
[36:50.360 --> 36:52.180]  show up because the balls told you not to.
[36:52.620 --> 36:58.240]  Or it could be an issue of do I need the shit? Do I use the toilet?
[36:58.240 --> 37:02.220]  If you make everything a choice... I think I used the example
[37:02.220 --> 37:05.680]  should I wipe my arse? And you were just like, that's ridiculous. Of course I'm wiping my arse.
[37:06.580 --> 37:10.440]  So I think it has to be... that's the kind of code I'm living by. It's things that
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.320]  I either want to do, but also part of me is saying you don't do that.
[37:14.340 --> 37:18.520]  Yeah, I think you could be more like, I think I have to shit. Do I shit now
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.740]  or wait 15 minutes? Do I shit now or later?
[37:21.920 --> 37:25.480]  It's more to fix indecision than
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.340]  Yeah, that's a great way to phrase it. I don't feel like
[37:29.340 --> 37:33.420]  once again, the 15 minute thing, are you asking me to shit myself? It depends
[37:33.420 --> 37:37.600]  on the situation. Do I have 15 minutes when I'm making that question? Or is that a question I'm asking
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.280]  when I have more than 15 minutes to hold? I don't know. I'm just thinking about my life.
[37:41.500 --> 37:45.680]  Very often I'll think, do I have time to take a shit right now? Or do I feel like taking a shit?
[37:45.980 --> 37:48.580]  Because I can hold it a couple... it'd be easier just to hold it and do it later.
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.120]  I feel like if I need a shit, I just go and have one.
[37:52.120 --> 37:55.880]  It depends on... for me, I can chamber my shits pretty long.
[37:55.980 --> 37:58.360]  I can't do that with pee, but definitely not with poop.
[38:00.720 --> 38:03.900]  A shit in the chamber is such a great combination of words.
[38:05.120 --> 38:06.980]  Do you feel like you have two chambers?
[38:09.340 --> 38:10.920]  I've got two shit chambers.
[38:11.920 --> 38:15.640]  Like somehow cars have a reserve gas tank? Yeah, I've got two.
[38:15.940 --> 38:20.200]  Like, I can sit down and do a poo, and it's done.
[38:20.200 --> 38:26.160]  I could wipe and get up, or I could do that, and then wait about five minutes, and then round two comes.
[38:26.480 --> 38:26.760]  Oh yeah.
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.640]  And it just buys me more time between now and the next poo if I get both chambers empty.
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.220]  I feel like that second... if I... let's say I do that, right?
[38:37.580 --> 38:41.160]  I take a shit, and then I eat something like a McDonald's burger?
[38:41.500 --> 38:43.760]  The cavalry is coming within 15 minutes.
[38:44.560 --> 38:48.640]  It's quick. It's gonna push down the next chamber.
[38:48.640 --> 38:52.960]  I don't... it's truly like a magic trick within itself. I don't know how to explain it, but
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.080]  when I eat fast food, certain fast food, the cavalry will come.
[38:57.180 --> 39:00.480]  I didn't know that anyone sent the memo out, but we're going back. It's a round two.
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.160]  We're immediately headed back to the camp.
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.000]  I have a similar thing where I drink iced coffee or cold brew pretty constantly.
[39:07.460 --> 39:13.920]  You know, like water. And you get at least one shit per cup of iced coffee.
[39:14.240 --> 39:15.760]  So it's like, there's some days where you can take...
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.180]  You're just going back and forth from the fridge to get more iced coffee to the toilet.
[39:20.500 --> 39:21.580]  It's a pretty constant stream.
[39:21.800 --> 39:27.040]  I forgot about dumping in England, because it's different food, different diet.
[39:27.860 --> 39:32.460]  It really... it dwindles down to... I think I was going once every couple of days.
[39:32.940 --> 39:34.980]  Whereas here, it's like, probably twice a day.
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.660]  And I love it. I love having an anus that hasn't been used in a day.
[39:41.780 --> 39:43.420]  It just feels nice.
[39:43.420 --> 39:48.020]  Well, why don't you just try to adopt your British bland, no-taste food diet?
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.520]  Like, the only reason you shit more in America is because you have better options.
[39:56.660 --> 39:58.040]  I don't know if that's true.
[39:58.460 --> 40:03.720]  You should test this. You think if there was a Franklin BBQ next to your house in Oxfordshire,
[40:03.840 --> 40:05.420]  you wouldn't eat there constantly?
[40:07.780 --> 40:10.460]  How am I going to test this, Andrew? What do you mean, I've got to test this?
[40:10.460 --> 40:14.500]  Well, you just... you get the same... you make the same food, so you eat the same food.
[40:14.600 --> 40:18.320]  You eat the diet you had when you were in England for, like, a week, and see what happens.
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.660]  I have to import all my meals from England. It's just different shit. It's different ingredients.
[40:21.860 --> 40:25.900]  Different sauces. It's not like sugar in the bread and stuff.
[40:26.320 --> 40:28.980]  I got you... you're being ridiculous.
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.160]  Yeah, but that's what expats do. You managed to get your hands on Brailston pickle. That wasn't so hard.
[40:34.300 --> 40:38.060]  Yeah. I got fucking multiple cans of salad cream.
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.540]  I like that Gavin's like, I have to eat Wonder Bread when I'm here.
[40:42.600 --> 40:46.480]  I have no choice. It's a law. I can only have this one type of sugary bread.
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.020]  The stuff on the British Isle is the stuff that keeps, like, the stuff in a jar.
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.660]  Like, pickled crap and baked beans. They're not, like, shipping salad and milk and bread and stuff over.
[40:56.020 --> 40:58.960]  What the fuck do you mean? You can't let you make the salad.
[40:59.280 --> 41:00.200]  What does that mean?
[41:00.600 --> 41:06.760]  You're saying British cows make milk that makes you shit less than American cows.
[41:07.300 --> 41:08.320]  That's what you're saying.
[41:08.700 --> 41:13.720]  No, I'm not saying it's specific to milk, but I mean, they certainly eat different grass and it's different tasting.
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.340]  I don't know. I feel like salad was a really weird choice by you.
[41:19.500 --> 41:21.260]  I was just picking something that's not going to last.
[41:21.620 --> 41:24.560]  American salad be making me shit like crazy.
[41:28.620 --> 41:30.840]  No one has ever said that. Ever.
[41:32.080 --> 41:33.340]  Until this moment.
[41:33.340 --> 41:42.360]  Well, I can't identify the individual different things that make me poop twice a day here and poop once every four days in England.
[41:43.320 --> 41:51.840]  Gavin, we have had this conversation 20 times over the course of our friendship and it always boils down to you like the food in America.
[41:52.080 --> 41:55.160]  You have more options that are more exciting to you that are worse for you.
[41:55.300 --> 41:57.040]  And you can't control yourself in America.
[41:57.040 --> 41:59.400]  And in England, there's less to eat.
[41:59.440 --> 42:02.640]  So you just eat. You make your own pasta all day, all night long.
[42:02.680 --> 42:03.220]  And that's what you eat.
[42:03.220 --> 42:04.200]  And then you never shit.
[42:05.120 --> 42:12.660]  I'm going to try this the next week. Starting next week, I'm going to try and eat stuff that causes me to shit once every two days.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.160]  But I don't think I could do it.
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.260]  With the whole of H-E-B, I don't think I could do it.
[42:17.540 --> 42:23.040]  You're acting like shepherd's pie is the most exotic dish that you cannot access.
[42:23.860 --> 42:27.940]  They don't have the technology to make shepherd's pie in anywhere else.
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.000]  I need my non-shitting British crisps.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.900]  The American crisps are ripping my asshole apart.
[42:35.140 --> 42:39.940]  I'd love to hear from comment leavers who have spent significant time between these two countries.
[42:40.400 --> 42:42.120]  Because I'm not making it up.
[42:43.360 --> 42:44.960]  Nobody thinks you're making it up.
[42:47.660 --> 42:50.080]  We just don't think it's the quality of the food.
[42:50.340 --> 42:55.000]  We think you eat shitty food in America. Because Austin is a shitty food town.
[42:55.100 --> 42:56.520]  It is a foodie town.
[42:56.520 --> 43:01.200]  Do you think you could do it? Do you think you could eat next week and shit once every two days?
[43:01.560 --> 43:04.680]  I don't know! I've never had that experience.
[43:04.980 --> 43:06.720]  It's like a weird thing to say.
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.480]  Can I only shit once every two days?
[43:12.060 --> 43:14.280]  Is that what you're asking? Is that the question?
[43:14.720 --> 43:17.080]  If you could change your diet to achieve that.
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.060]  Andrew, how often do you shit every day?
[43:21.880 --> 43:23.100]  Definitely every day.
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.900]  How many poops a day do you have?
[43:26.140 --> 43:27.960]  You average once a day, Gavin.
[43:31.040 --> 43:34.120]  Between one and two. But definitely one.
[43:34.620 --> 43:37.180]  I would say I'm between two and four a day.
[43:39.660 --> 43:41.160]  I'm exceptionally healthy.
[43:41.580 --> 43:43.240]  The more you shit, the better off you are.
[43:43.740 --> 43:44.740]  Is that true?
[43:45.180 --> 43:49.940]  I think that just means you're having as much coffee as you should be having water.
[43:50.100 --> 43:52.500]  It's like you're running shit drills.
[43:53.760 --> 44:04.940]  I feel like you just made a 15 minute argument that the reason why Gavin shits more is because he eats shittier food.
[44:05.080 --> 44:07.780]  And then you're like, I have four shits because I'm so healthy.
[44:07.780 --> 44:09.180]  What are you talking about?
[44:10.220 --> 44:13.200]  I gotta defend myself here. I'm also full of shit.
[44:15.440 --> 44:20.220]  I'm an anomaly. I'm different because I have to take medicine to make me shit or I'll die.
[44:20.540 --> 44:21.920]  Because I have that disease.
[44:22.400 --> 44:27.600]  So every night of my life, I have to drink Miralax, which then makes me shit my brains out.
[44:27.860 --> 44:28.980]  Gently, I might add.
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.780]  The amount of Miralax I go through is unbelievable.
[44:36.420 --> 44:38.960]  Yeah, well, that explains the four days sometimes.
[44:39.300 --> 44:45.880]  I'd like not to turn it into a full shit podcast like we've had before, but what's Nick and Eric's averages while we've got them here?
[44:46.200 --> 44:48.080]  Oh, that's a great question. Once every other day.
[44:49.140 --> 44:51.400]  Whoa, you're on the English way? How'd you do it?
[44:52.960 --> 44:57.340]  I mean, I don't think I eat too, too much, so that's probably it.
[44:59.760 --> 45:01.440]  I think it's just probably less food.
[45:01.440 --> 45:05.680]  You're saying it's just a quantity thing? Nick, what are you shitting, man? Once a day.
[45:06.540 --> 45:09.920]  So wait, but I just have lunch and dinner.
[45:10.740 --> 45:11.700]  Are you just having lunch?
[45:12.600 --> 45:19.200]  I mean, it's kind of like eating, like grazing kind of like throughout the day, but nothing's like a huge meal typically.
[45:19.580 --> 45:20.220]  How about this?
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.100]  Eric, what's on the menu for today? What will you eat from start to finish today?
[45:26.580 --> 45:29.640]  I had a banana. I had broccoli.
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.020]  Brown rice and chicken.
[45:33.340 --> 45:37.660]  I'll probably have like steak and maybe a quesadilla.
[45:37.920 --> 45:41.400]  Something to like for dinner, but like all of these are smaller.
[45:41.620 --> 45:45.960]  So throughout the day I'll have some pineapple or watermelon or something like that.
[45:45.960 --> 45:48.740]  That's probably what I'll have typically.
[45:49.060 --> 45:52.060]  How about you, Gav? What is your average day?
[45:54.280 --> 45:56.980]  Like you said, you only eat lunch and dinner. So what'd you have for lunch today?
[45:56.980 --> 45:58.020]  And what are you going to have for dinner tonight?
[46:00.020 --> 46:01.720]  I didn't mean to stump you. I'm sorry.
[46:04.200 --> 46:07.100]  I don't want to grind the podcast to a halt or anything. We can move on.
[46:07.280 --> 46:10.040]  I was thinking about what I had today. I had a smoothie for lunch.
[46:13.180 --> 46:14.240]  Don't know what I'm going to have tonight.
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.560]  I don't want to make this too gross, but I have a question.
[46:19.520 --> 46:20.840]  Are all shits equal?
[46:20.840 --> 46:21.220]  No.
[46:21.460 --> 46:27.200]  Is there a bunt of the shitting world?
[46:27.460 --> 46:31.400]  Is that where you hold out a baseball bat to shit?
[46:33.300 --> 46:37.060]  I still honestly don't know how the bat knobs work. We haven't even touched on those.
[46:37.220 --> 46:38.800]  But I'm still confused about that process.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.360]  We've got to have the bat knob update.
[46:44.500 --> 46:48.200]  Every time you sit on a toilet and shit comes out, is that a shit?
[46:48.200 --> 46:51.800]  If you need to wipe, you've taken a shit.
[46:52.540 --> 46:56.100]  I just feel like that scale isn't fair.
[46:56.560 --> 46:56.920]  What do you mean?
[46:59.740 --> 47:02.840]  You're just going to sit down and shit one more teaser and then you're done?
[47:03.300 --> 47:07.100]  I'm saying that can happen. Think about the fishing world.
[47:07.700 --> 47:12.480]  If I pull out a 20 foot salmon,
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.640]  the biggest goddamn salmon anyone's ever seen, and somebody fishes a goldfish,
[47:16.640 --> 47:18.740]  those shouldn't count as the same thing.
[47:19.240 --> 47:24.300]  And Nick has brought up an interesting point.
[47:24.480 --> 47:26.260]  What about the rare wipe-free shits?
[47:26.660 --> 47:28.820]  You still have to wipe, so it counts.
[47:32.220 --> 47:36.500]  Why is everything on this podcast,
[47:36.640 --> 47:38.720]  we need to find the regulation version of it?
[47:41.400 --> 47:44.400]  If Geoff is saying I'm shitting four times a day,
[47:44.400 --> 47:45.480]  which is really high,
[47:46.480 --> 47:50.560]  See, that's a lot to me.
[47:50.860 --> 47:54.680]  In my head, it can't be what I would consider the average shit.
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.000]  I can't wrap my head around, you're taking four average shits a day.
[47:59.800 --> 48:02.040]  Not all shits are created equal, but they're all shits.
[48:06.080 --> 48:08.380]  Not every shit is a grand slam.
[48:08.960 --> 48:12.340]  Not every shit is a home run. A lot of shits are doubles and singles.
[48:12.340 --> 48:14.760]  I have a lot of doubles. I have a lot of doubles in my life.
[48:14.820 --> 48:20.940]  I'm in scoring position, I got an extra base, it's good for the team.
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.940]  I haven't scored, but it's way better than a bunt or a single.
[48:24.700 --> 48:28.680]  Maybe I advanced the runner if there was somebody on, maybe I scored a run, I don't know.
[48:28.980 --> 48:30.860]  What would the grand slam be?
[48:31.940 --> 48:33.460]  No, I don't want to know.
[48:33.580 --> 48:37.760]  I think it's probably whatever happened to Andrew that day when he almost shit on a tree at the mall or whatever.
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.800]  No, I honestly think the grand slam is because you feel good about yourself when it's a grand slam.
[48:43.140 --> 48:46.340]  It is a giant shit that requires no wipe at all.
[48:46.540 --> 48:48.940]  That's the grand slam. You can just get up and go.
[48:50.640 --> 48:51.840]  Love a good grand slam.
[48:52.380 --> 48:54.000]  Miralax does not allow for grand slams.
[48:54.440 --> 48:57.960]  Yeah, it's rare, I don't get a lot of grand slams in Austin, I'll be honest.
[49:01.660 --> 49:05.260]  The chat is going very gross right now.
[49:05.740 --> 49:07.220]  What's the knob update?
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.060]  Yeah, well, I have a knob update.
[49:12.540 --> 49:13.960]  I'm going to tell you right now.
[49:14.340 --> 49:19.940]  I'd like to preface this, by the way, with I'm going to annoy you in this conversation that we're about to have.
[49:21.040 --> 49:22.120]  What does that mean?
[49:22.580 --> 49:23.260]  You're going to get annoyed.
[49:25.660 --> 49:30.180]  So, here's the knob update. I had the 100 baseball bats, full-size baseball bats, right?
[49:30.180 --> 49:34.340]  And I had 900 pre-made knobs.
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.020]  Eventually, I got 1,100 metal tags.
[49:40.460 --> 49:42.160]  Numbers 1 through 100 twice.
[49:42.680 --> 49:46.340]  Everything I needed. I began last Thursday or Friday.
[49:46.680 --> 49:50.520]  I got the old... I got my chop saw that I bought. I set it all up in my backyard.
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.860]  And Saturday and Sunday, I want to say I spent about 7 hours each day.
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.080]  I'm very tan now.
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.800]  Spent 7 hours on Saturday and probably 7 hours on Sunday cutting knobs.
[50:02.220 --> 50:06.000]  I did 102 bats. All 102 bats are knobless.
[50:06.240 --> 50:09.920]  I then had to take the cut knobs, which were imperfect,
[50:10.560 --> 50:12.440]  and sand them down with a little
[50:13.080 --> 50:18.020]  Black & Decker mouse sander. And then, I sanded the bat end,
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.900]  because that was fucked up as well, and I just wanted it to be nice and symmetrical.
[50:21.140 --> 50:25.020]  So, I cut 102 knobs, I sanded 102 knobs,
[50:25.020 --> 50:29.300]  and then I sanded 102 bat ends.
[50:29.880 --> 50:33.260]  That was my entire weekend. That was probably 25 hours of work
[50:33.260 --> 50:37.060]  or something over the course of the weekend. Although, I gotta say, way fucking
[50:37.060 --> 50:40.460]  better and way more enjoyable and way more fun to do
[50:40.780 --> 50:44.840]  than burning those fucking numbers into those tiny bats.
[50:45.020 --> 50:48.980]  That was way less work, but way shittier work. I enjoyed every second of playing
[50:48.980 --> 50:53.120]  with the power tools this weekend. When I finished that, I then affixed
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.180]  the little metal serial numbers to the
[50:57.180 --> 51:00.600]  knobs that I created, and then
[51:01.300 --> 51:05.180]  affixed the other ones to the knobless bats, so they had
[51:05.180 --> 51:09.200]  matches. I have since given those to Rooster Teeth.
[51:09.460 --> 51:13.240]  They have them. They're in Rooster Teeth's possession. So, I no longer have 102 bats
[51:13.240 --> 51:16.580]  in my house. What I do still have is 900 bat knobs, which,
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.140]  holy shit, 900 is such a bigger number than 100.
[51:21.140 --> 51:24.760]  It is going to take me the rest of my fucking life to do
[51:25.520 --> 51:28.280]  to put these tags on these
[51:28.940 --> 51:32.880]  pre-made bat knobs. I think I've done about, since Monday, I think I've done about
[51:33.520 --> 51:37.200]  450. So, I'm about halfway there. I've seen some of the pictures. I've seen, I
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.300]  will say, the quality of work. Excellent. They look professionally
[51:41.300 --> 51:44.860]  done. I think that they, I think the audience, the comment leavers, the
[51:44.860 --> 51:49.160]  purchasers, will be very surprised and pleased with the level of
[51:49.160 --> 51:52.180]  quality. I do. I put a lot of love and effort into it. But here's the problem.
[51:52.880 --> 51:55.880]  They're all the wrong size. Every single one of them.
[51:56.940 --> 52:01.000]  They're all wrong. We had this conversation
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.240]  there was size 1, there was size 2, and there was size 3. We agreed
[52:05.240 --> 52:09.160]  that size 1 was like a button and size
[52:09.160 --> 52:12.620]  3 was ridiculous. It's like half the handle. Size 2,
[52:13.060 --> 52:17.100]  the perfect knob. You've made every single one in size
[52:17.100 --> 52:21.160]  3. Okay, here's my rebuttal to that. First off, one, fuck
[52:21.160 --> 52:25.160]  you. Two, I measured
[52:25.160 --> 52:29.080]  and made them the same size as all of the pre-made bat knobs
[52:29.080 --> 52:33.160]  so they would be uniform. So don't blame me, blame the
[52:33.160 --> 52:36.840]  900 bat knobs that I had to match. I mean, it would have been,
[52:36.860 --> 52:41.020]  obviously, all 900 are the wrong size. It would have been a good opportunity to make
[52:41.020 --> 52:44.500]  100 of the correct size that could have been the special ones.
[52:44.500 --> 52:48.600]  You can suck the poop out of my
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.300]  butthole. That's what you can do.
[52:52.560 --> 52:54.480]  The third one of the day? The fourth one? Which one?
[52:56.220 --> 53:00.600]  Any of the four poos. Or all four, I don't care.
[53:01.300 --> 53:04.380]  I'm pooping pretty regularly throughout the day, so anytime you want to come over, I'm probably
[53:04.380 --> 53:08.480]  within an hour of a poop. You little bitch. Did you not think when you
[53:08.480 --> 53:12.020]  saw all of the half handle ones?
[53:12.020 --> 53:16.040]  This is the size it is. I'm not gonna go and cut down
[53:16.040 --> 53:19.480]  the 900. I'm just gonna make the 100 the same size. And by the way,
[53:20.820 --> 53:22.700]  dickhead, you know where I live.
[53:24.700 --> 53:27.820]  Feel free to come over and help out at any point.
[53:27.940 --> 53:31.980]  Whenever you fucking want to. I'm happy to help. I'm just
[53:31.980 --> 53:35.580]  saying, we gotta sand down 900 knobs to the right size.
[53:36.260 --> 53:39.900]  They're fine. What do you mean? They're fine.
[53:39.900 --> 53:43.760]  And they're too long. How long are they? The knob
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.200]  should be about an inch. It should be stuck on a cabinet.
[53:48.820 --> 53:51.900]  Hold on, and I'll find out, because I gotta go find a fucking knob
[53:51.900 --> 53:55.900]  and then I'll measure it. Continue to converse. And by the way, however
[53:55.900 --> 54:00.020]  long, whatever number I come back with, if it's 3 inches or 7
[54:00.020 --> 54:03.800]  inches or whatever, just so you know, whatever that number is, is the correct
[54:03.800 --> 54:08.060]  fucking number for how big a bat knob should be as of this moment. It is now
[54:08.060 --> 54:12.100]  the regulation bat knob size. No matter what that number is
[54:12.100 --> 54:15.980]  it is the regulation bat knob size that governs
[54:15.980 --> 54:20.040]  all bat knobs across the galaxy in perpetuity.
[54:20.340 --> 54:24.060]  I'll be right back. Andrew, you do remember the conversation we had, right? Well, we had
[54:24.060 --> 54:28.040]  the 3 different sizes. You know what? I honestly don't, but I'm glad you do, because this has been
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.960]  a lot of fun. You do, Eric. You do, right? Oh no, I remember.
[54:32.380 --> 54:35.780]  I appreciate you saying that this is going to annoy him. What number did we fail?
[54:35.780 --> 54:39.660]  I remember it happened. I don't remember the decision. Oh no, I remember. I just don't remember what length
[54:39.660 --> 54:43.540]  I know it was like the middle where it wasn't the button and it wasn't like half the bat
[54:43.540 --> 54:47.820]  but like, just before Geoff gets back, what number are you happy with?
[54:48.300 --> 54:51.680]  Do you think? I would want like between 1 and 1.5
[54:51.680 --> 54:54.540]  to be the actual knobs. Anything that
[54:55.420 --> 54:59.480]  makes it longer than that to the point where it is long and not like
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.180]  a cube is too long. I will say
[55:03.180 --> 55:07.440]  you saying 1 to 1.5 makes me so thrilled for whatever
[55:07.440 --> 55:11.420]  Geoff is going to come back with because there's no way
[55:11.420 --> 55:14.280]  there's going to be about 3 inches at least. Also
[55:15.860 --> 55:19.160]  what was that Andrew? Are you saying that we're selling
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.320]  handles and not knobs? We had the whole conversation. We ended up
[55:23.320 --> 55:26.700]  deciding between a button, a knob, and a handle. He's made
[55:26.700 --> 55:31.300]  1000 handles. Okay, I'm back. We put this to
[55:31.300 --> 55:35.540]  a public vote, didn't we? Do you want just the knob?
[55:36.400 --> 55:39.220]  The part that comes off the knob is what I measured, not the knob itself.
[55:39.800 --> 55:41.680]  I'd like it in Dinklages as well.
[55:43.700 --> 55:47.060]  Someone find the public poll we did.
[55:47.640 --> 55:50.080]  What are you measuring, Geoff? It's about an inch and a half.
[55:52.840 --> 55:55.240]  But that is without... No, I'm kidding. I've been
[55:55.240 --> 55:56.560]  listening to this whole thing. It's 3 inches.
[55:56.560 --> 55:59.520]  Son of a bitch.
[56:00.300 --> 56:04.700]  That's how big Tony and the merch department made it.
[56:04.820 --> 56:06.140]  So that's how big it is.
[56:07.420 --> 56:12.200]  How about this, dickhead? Show up at any of the merch meetings
[56:12.200 --> 56:15.720]  and make your opinion heard. We have them every two weeks.
[56:15.980 --> 56:20.100]  You're always invited. You've showed up to zero merch meetings.
[56:20.700 --> 56:24.060]  Where did their merch meet? The comment leavers voted.
[56:24.060 --> 56:28.240]  You did it on Instagram. The comment leavers don't make the bat knobs.
[56:28.320 --> 56:31.320]  The merch department does. They buy them.
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.100]  Oh man, I had a completely different issue than I thought
[56:36.100 --> 56:38.880]  it was unrelated. I'm so happy that yours is this.
[56:41.760 --> 56:43.400]  What's your different issue?
[56:44.260 --> 56:46.820]  So we're only selling the knobs, right?
[56:47.160 --> 56:50.120]  I don't know what we're selling to this point.
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.960]  I was talking about this with Emily the other night.
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.140]  I was thinking we should sell...
[56:56.140 --> 56:59.320]  The 900 knobs will sell as knobs, right?
[56:59.500 --> 57:04.320]  But the other, the 102, I think those should be blind items.
[57:04.440 --> 57:07.420]  You're buying one or the other and you don't know. It's a 50-50 chance.
[57:07.480 --> 57:09.220]  Do I get the bat end?
[57:11.800 --> 57:14.120]  Like a blind box.
[57:14.120 --> 57:17.280]  That was my issue. This is a terrible...
[57:17.280 --> 57:21.480]  It's the only one I could find and it's largely obstructed. It's from our most recent
[57:21.480 --> 57:26.160]  BreakShit stream. You're holding the bat up. Our logo is on the end
[57:26.160 --> 57:29.280]  of the bat and then you cut off the bottom part. So I was curious
[57:29.280 --> 57:32.960]  why did we put a logo on the end of the bat if we weren't going to sell it?
[57:34.040 --> 57:37.600]  I feel like we've had that discussion multiple times. There's nothing we can do about it now.
[57:37.620 --> 57:40.700]  I just have no idea what's going on. Also the cereal, I will say this,
[57:40.700 --> 57:44.240]  because we all shared and agreed that that was ludicrous,
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.620]  but I will say that in my mind that was solved because
[57:48.620 --> 57:52.620]  when I started putting the cereal numbers on I realized that the cereal numbers say f***face on them.
[57:52.720 --> 57:55.140]  So it is technically labeled on the other end.
[57:56.320 --> 58:00.640]  Good to know. That was mine. I wasn't sure if we were going to sell what we were doing
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.720]  the other half. I thought we were selling full bats and knobs. Not that we were just
[58:04.720 --> 58:08.080]  doing knobs in the half. How are we still having this
[58:09.220 --> 58:12.280]  particular conversation? I don't know. What are we selling?
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.140]  This is incredible. Hey Geoff, do you like producing?
[58:16.440 --> 58:19.640]  Are you having a good time? Because this is what it is all the time for every show.
[58:20.720 --> 58:23.880]  It's the best. I feel like I do feel very...
[58:23.880 --> 58:27.520]  because obviously I wasn't in the meetings, I haven't helped in any way,
[58:27.720 --> 58:31.860]  and I'm still annoyed by it. So I feel like, you know, maybe I'm the
[58:31.860 --> 58:36.360]  arsehole in this situation. But I'm pretty sure
[58:36.360 --> 58:39.980]  they should all have been size number two. Pretty sure about that.
[58:40.100 --> 58:44.200]  Well, you know, for the record, I wanted size number one and I acquiesced to two.
[58:44.360 --> 58:48.420]  And if they ended up as three, I don't give a fuck, dude. I voted for
[58:48.420 --> 58:52.100]  one. I just wanted it to be a fucking... I just wanted it to be a knob.
[58:52.180 --> 58:56.280]  I didn't want any end on it. Y'all are the ones that fought for the ends. No, I like the knob.
[58:56.620 --> 59:00.100]  I'm a fan of the knob. The reason this is perfect, though, is that
[59:00.100 --> 59:03.760]  it's been completely f***-faced again. And this is the perfect product.
[59:03.760 --> 59:06.320]  Here's what I'm looking forward to. We're selling handles.
[59:07.420 --> 59:11.860]  So we sell these items, right? We started with the 50
[59:11.860 --> 59:15.500]  bats, minibats. Then we've gotten to the knobs. Now we've got the 100
[59:16.280 --> 59:19.720]  self-cut and then the 900. So the next order's gonna be, I think,
[59:19.840 --> 59:23.700]  probably at least 10,000 knobs. And I'm gonna... you know what?
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.680]  I'm gonna take a backseat and I'm gonna let you do those, Gav. You're very
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.200]  opinionated on knob size, on shaft length.
[59:31.200 --> 59:35.260]  And instead of fighting against the tide and getting it wrong
[59:35.260 --> 59:39.480]  every time and then being a huge embarrassment to the company and the podcast,
[59:39.780 --> 59:43.320]  I'm gonna take a step back and when we do the run of 10,000, I'm gonna
[59:43.320 --> 59:47.440]  let you cut them all. And then we'll know they're gonna be done to Gavin's exacting standards,
[59:47.640 --> 59:51.400]  which I think makes sense to me. Can I borrow your
[59:51.400 --> 59:54.420]  tools? Absolutely. Okay.
[59:56.440 --> 59:59.240]  I feel like, Gavin, you said that you feel like you're the asshole
[59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.260]  in this process. I think that's been the constant throughout this.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.280]  All you've done is cause chaos. I remember, like, three months
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.280]  ago, it feels like Eric, Geoff, and I were in a
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.200]  merch meeting. We settled all of this. It all made sense. For the first
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.120]  time, it clicked. Then we recorded, like, 30 minutes later, and you
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.320]  asked three questions and made arguments that we couldn't counter. You just, like,
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.200]  you threw a fucking wrench into everything. You weren't there. You just... all you've done is cause
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.140]  chaos in this process. I feel like I was asking good questions.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.080]  Maybe you should ask them at the meetings. I don't think anybody's saying your
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.140]  questions are bad. I think that maybe they were just asked at the wrong place at the
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.380]  wrong time. Well, just have the meetings on Slack, and I can read them and reply to them.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.340]  A meeting is... that's extreme. A meeting about a batten-up
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.680]  mentor. There's so much that is not...
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.560]  there's so much discussed in those meetings that we go, oh, and this. Oh, and this.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.200]  Yeah, it is no joke, dude. There's a lot of ground that gets covered in those meetings, for sure.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.500]  Like the new jet-ski merchandise that we should talk about at some point. Oh, we didn't even talk about our
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.680]  jet-ski adventure. We'll have to talk about it next episode. Alright. I'm really
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.540]  excited to get a bat handle. I'm really excited. Yeah? I hope you...
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:14.240]  I feel like you're overselling the handle now. I feel like you feel bad. I hope you click
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.460]  quickly on the store when they go for sale, because they're gonna go fast, and I don't have any
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.280]  extras to give you, so you can buy one like the rest of them. Oh, I didn't get a special one?
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.060]  That's fair. I didn't make special ones this time. I did. I made
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:30.140]  two special ones, but they're not for y'all. I made... because we had a hundred, and then
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.680]  there were more bats, and I thought, just in case I miscounted,
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.560]  because I was numbering them as I went, I was like, just in case I miscounted,
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.360]  let me do two extra ones, and then I'll just affix numbers to them. But then I realized
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.280]  there was only one 101 and one 102, so I hand-wrote
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.240]  those. So those are the two special ones. And I signed them. Is there
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.360]  such thing as a saw that has sandpaper on the
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.120]  circular bit? It, like, saws and sands.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.940]  That is a great invention, if it doesn't exist.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:06.200]  And you should patent it. Okay. We could sell it, and then I'll complain it's the wrong
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.220]  size. Should we... should we stop talking so that we can
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.280]  start talking again very quickly? Yeah. Alright. Well, thanks for listening to another episode of
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.700]  f***. I had no idea what episode this was. Do you guys know? 67.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.600]  67. Jesus Christ. Alright. Episode 67.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.620]  If you like f***face, or even if you're just okay
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.060]  with f***face, maybe buy some f***face merchandise at store.rooseteeth.com
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.240]  or just go to rooseteeth.com and click on the store link. We'll have bat knobs,
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.080]  we have waffle bombs, we have f***buttons,
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.480]  we have child kicker merch, just all kinds of dumb shit
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.540]  you could buy. There you go. You could buy. Also, we have a YouTube channel that has cool
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.680]  stuff like my bike trick on it that you can check out. It did phenomenally well.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.560]  It got like 70,000 views or something. It's doing great. People love your trick.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.480]  Wait till we drop the next mixtape. We should end this with a magic trick.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:01.700]  Geoff, think of a number between 1 and 60 really quick. Just think of one, tell me when you have it. Okay, I got it.
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:07.990]  Okay. 19. Are you
[01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:11.130]  serious? Yeah. What number did you say? 19.
[01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.770]  You're breaking up. You said 1-9. 19, right? Yes. No way.
[01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.230]  No f***ing way. No way. No f***ing way.
[01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:23.250]  Are you taking the piss? This is bulls**t. No way.
[01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:27.670]  Do you know why I picked 19? I'll very clearly tell you why I picked 19.
[01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.510]  Because it's my birthday. No. No.
[01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.110]  So I immediately wrote 19 down.
[01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:39.910]  I planned the opposite. I wanted to keep doing it for as long as annoyingly possible
[01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:44.110]  expecting it to never hit. I literally read it in the discord
[01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:47.530]  half a second before you said it. Me too. Me too.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:50.370]  This isn't real. Holy s***.
[01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.270]  What are the odds?
[01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.110]  I have no...
[01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.410]  We actually don't know. I don't know how many balls are in the machine.
[01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:08.250]  We truly don't know the odds. 1 in 50 something probably. I have no
[01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:12.010]  idea how that happened or what that means but it can only be
[01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:15.530]  It can only portend positive things going forward.
[01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:16.930]  It's gotta be good luck, right?
[01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:24.050]  We should sell number 19 ping pong balls and we all autograph them.
[01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:27.550]  Lucky 19 ping pong balls. That's our next thing.
[01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:30.130]  Okay, wrap it up. Goodbye. Thank you.
[01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:33.290]  That'd be the size of a tennis ball.
