[00:32.160 --> 00:35.940]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:36.160 --> 00:38.000]  This is episode 69.
[00:38.620 --> 00:41.040]  No importance to that number really.
[00:41.120 --> 00:43.440]  It's just the one that follows episode 68.
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.480]  It comes right before 70.
[00:44.820 --> 00:48.280]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton from Canada.
[00:48.520 --> 00:50.100]  Gavin Free from England.
[00:50.700 --> 00:53.220]  Eric Baudour from the land of San Diego.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.320]  Nick Schwartz from... I don't know where Nick is.
[00:55.360 --> 00:57.360]  Nick is from Austin, Texas, I've decided.
[00:57.520 --> 01:01.600]  And I am from Mobile, Alabama.
[01:01.980 --> 01:06.720]  And together, every week, we sit down and we talk about
[01:06.720 --> 01:08.480]  tarot cards and tarot card readings.
[01:08.620 --> 01:09.860]  Andrew, you were saying?
[01:09.860 --> 01:13.040]  Well, I was just... we talked about... we have that Rookie of the Year bet.
[01:13.360 --> 01:16.340]  And I had somebody reach out a long time ago,
[01:16.820 --> 01:18.960]  back when we were talking about doing it with basketball.
[01:19.380 --> 01:22.980]  And I had been meaning to email them, and they reached out over Twitter last night
[01:22.980 --> 01:27.320]  about the bets and being willing to help send some positive magic
[01:27.780 --> 01:29.360]  towards the players of our choice.
[01:29.920 --> 01:32.880]  And part of that was I got to have a tarot card reading on the bet.
[01:33.520 --> 01:36.380]  Got to kind of get an analysis of how things are going to go.
[01:36.380 --> 01:40.820]  Essentially, from my memory, the first card I got said that
[01:40.820 --> 01:44.160]  my strengths are in my ambition and sneakiness,
[01:44.340 --> 01:45.580]  but it may cause resentment.
[01:46.860 --> 01:47.420]  And...
[01:48.340 --> 01:51.120]  Strike through the word may.
[01:51.740 --> 01:56.400]  Yeah. And the second card was like, I'm holding on to the past,
[01:56.500 --> 01:59.160]  which could be bad bets lost in the past,
[01:59.300 --> 02:02.320]  which is path of gambling, if not 80%.
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.300]  It's like, that's all gambling is, is you having regret about things you've done.
[02:06.800 --> 02:09.200]  I don't remember... I think the third one was like,
[02:09.260 --> 02:11.440]  success would come from teamwork in something.
[02:11.780 --> 02:13.740]  I don't remember how it would work, exactly.
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.740]  Like this team? Like f***face?
[02:16.040 --> 02:17.840]  I mean, you could interpret that in so many ways.
[02:17.940 --> 02:22.200]  Maybe the success of Justin Fields is in his teamwork,
[02:22.500 --> 02:24.100]  or the players we're going to pick.
[02:24.220 --> 02:26.980]  But essentially, I opted, I had to make a choice,
[02:27.080 --> 02:30.580]  because the interpretation was that the magic would be most powerful
[02:30.580 --> 02:32.220]  if focused on only one person.
[02:32.620 --> 02:36.520]  But I didn't want to risk the resentfulness that may come with that.
[02:36.960 --> 02:40.400]  So I put everything on Geoff and my player,
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.940]  and Gavin, I didn't send anything your way,
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.840]  because I figured you're naturally lucky enough.
[02:44.000 --> 02:44.780]  You don't need it.
[02:44.980 --> 02:45.260]  It's true.
[02:45.340 --> 02:46.660]  Mac Jones is going to be fine.
[02:46.980 --> 02:48.960]  Poor Mac Jones. He's not going to be doing as well.
[02:49.400 --> 02:50.440]  No, you don't...
[02:50.440 --> 02:52.680]  I love that you remember how to say his last name.
[02:53.080 --> 02:53.980]  I got told by Eric.
[02:56.160 --> 02:58.200]  I think what you need to evaluate, Gavin,
[02:58.200 --> 03:01.460]  is your natural luck opposed to my bad luck
[03:01.460 --> 03:02.900]  that the magic needs to counter.
[03:03.140 --> 03:06.920]  It's a much deeper hole for the magic to take effect on my side.
[03:06.940 --> 03:08.400]  I don't think I have good luck.
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.980]  I think I have luck boosters.
[03:10.300 --> 03:12.660]  Like, if your luck is bad, I'll make it worse.
[03:13.060 --> 03:16.380]  That's what I've seen wherever I'm deciding what you bet.
[03:16.820 --> 03:19.040]  I'm like a luck catalyst.
[03:21.420 --> 03:22.220]  It's true.
[03:22.440 --> 03:25.960]  I don't think I've ever won based off of advice given by you.
[03:25.960 --> 03:27.640]  And we've done this multiple times.
[03:27.820 --> 03:29.380]  On the show and off the show.
[03:30.900 --> 03:34.380]  I think I'm like 0-7 based upon Gavin's guidance.
[03:35.540 --> 03:38.180]  Eventually, you should just go in on a million dollar bet.
[03:38.480 --> 03:42.340]  Because if you've lost 10 times, you can't lose 11. Surely.
[03:42.400 --> 03:45.800]  That is such a gambler's mentality that is completely wrong.
[03:45.900 --> 03:47.700]  And I love... I completely agree with.
[03:48.080 --> 03:50.060]  It cannot possibly be red again.
[03:50.200 --> 03:50.660]  Oh, it's red.
[03:51.140 --> 03:54.320]  There's no way it will be red one more time.
[03:54.320 --> 04:00.180]  Man, I know there's only so many f*** face hours and a f*** face day.
[04:00.600 --> 04:07.680]  But I would love some shoulder content for this podcast that's you getting your tarot reading recorded.
[04:08.080 --> 04:10.420]  Oh, well, it's already... the tarot's done already.
[04:10.680 --> 04:11.180]  I'm gonna get one.
[04:11.180 --> 04:11.960]  Well, we can always do it again.
[04:12.340 --> 04:15.420]  I just think that, especially in the context of this bet,
[04:15.840 --> 04:22.980]  I almost feel like we should have all three of us do tarot readings and have them be recorded so that we can release it to the audience.
[04:23.080 --> 04:25.580]  Yeah, well, this is scary territory, buddy.
[04:25.760 --> 04:28.500]  We're dealing with the dark arts.
[04:29.040 --> 04:32.020]  My first ever tarot reading, the very first card that I ever...
[04:32.020 --> 04:33.500]  Like, I don't even know the cards at this point.
[04:33.940 --> 04:34.580]  Pull the card.
[04:35.040 --> 04:35.400]  Death.
[04:35.840 --> 04:36.360]  That's not a bad card.
[04:36.360 --> 04:38.460]  But then I was told that it was not actually that bad.
[04:38.800 --> 04:40.100]  And you don't want to pull the tower.
[04:40.880 --> 04:42.660]  But bullshit, death's a bad card.
[04:42.980 --> 04:43.960]  Death's not a bad card.
[04:44.100 --> 04:44.880]  Death's just change, buddy.
[04:45.080 --> 04:45.480]  The tower!
[04:45.620 --> 04:46.920]  The tower's a bad card.
[04:47.360 --> 04:48.040]  For sure.
[04:48.300 --> 04:49.100]  That's the one you don't want to pull.
[04:49.100 --> 04:49.160]  That's what I said.
[04:49.160 --> 04:53.580]  I feel like the death card is like the ace of a blackjack card.
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.320]  Like, the equivalent of it's very powerful or useless.
[04:57.020 --> 04:59.620]  Like, it could be an 11, which could be very useful to you.
[04:59.640 --> 05:02.340]  As long as the death isn't pointed at you, that's a powerful card.
[05:02.960 --> 05:07.440]  I mean, I don't understand how tarot works, but I don't think death necessarily is a bad thing.
[05:07.680 --> 05:08.360]  It's not.
[05:08.660 --> 05:09.500]  It really isn't.
[05:09.640 --> 05:10.820]  In the tarot world.
[05:11.540 --> 05:12.340]  Oh, man.
[05:12.700 --> 05:15.640]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's all horseshit in general, isn't it?
[05:15.740 --> 05:16.460]  None of it's bad.
[05:16.780 --> 05:17.720]  It's paper.
[05:18.120 --> 05:21.020]  Well, you say that now, but let's see who wins this bet.
[05:21.140 --> 05:21.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:22.380 --> 05:23.100]  I'm a skeptic.
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.960]  I'm the James Randi of this podcast.
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.880]  Well, I'm glad that I didn't put any magic towards you.
[05:27.960 --> 05:28.480]  It would have been a waste.
[05:28.620 --> 05:29.560]  It would have been a waste on you.
[05:29.640 --> 05:29.940]  Andrew?
[05:30.240 --> 05:31.340]  I was right all along.
[05:31.440 --> 05:31.900]  Yes, Geoff?
[05:32.080 --> 05:32.800]  Can I ask you a question?
[05:33.300 --> 05:33.640]  Of course.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.680]  Gavin, this is not for you.
[05:34.760 --> 05:35.840]  Please do not participate in this portion.
[05:36.260 --> 05:38.340]  Andrew, do you know who James Randi is?
[05:38.840 --> 05:39.140]  Yes.
[05:39.460 --> 05:39.800]  Yes, I do.
[05:39.820 --> 05:40.160]  Who is he?
[05:40.480 --> 05:44.180]  He is a, I believe, he's a skeptic, right?
[05:44.260 --> 05:47.280]  Generally speaking, he's somebody who has debunked several people
[05:47.280 --> 05:49.980]  he used to work on the Tonight Show a lot, where he'd come on
[05:49.980 --> 05:52.920]  and debunk people that claimed that they had psychic abilities.
[05:53.680 --> 05:53.940]  Okay.
[05:54.340 --> 05:56.340]  I think he's also a magician, maybe?
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.080]  Yeah, he was like the great Randi.
[05:58.160 --> 06:02.700]  But I guess when Uri Geller came on the talk show,
[06:03.440 --> 06:05.280]  was it Carson at the time,
[06:06.720 --> 06:10.600]  asked James Randi how to mess with Geller's, like, spoon betting?
[06:11.160 --> 06:12.820]  So he deliberately didn't have any,
[06:12.840 --> 06:16.620]  he didn't allow the crew of Uri Geller to get anywhere near all the props.
[06:16.620 --> 06:20.880]  So he just sat there for like 20 minutes trying to bend a spoon.
[06:21.320 --> 06:23.680]  Because he couldn't, he didn't pre-bend any of them.
[06:23.800 --> 06:24.800]  He couldn't do a trick.
[06:25.640 --> 06:28.780]  But it somehow made Uri Geller even more famous
[06:28.780 --> 06:30.580]  and it didn't tank his career in any way.
[06:30.660 --> 06:31.400]  It's very interesting.
[06:31.860 --> 06:34.820]  I feel like there's a clip of Randi on like a show
[06:34.820 --> 06:37.820]  and it was a guy claiming that he could move things with his mind
[06:37.820 --> 06:40.900]  and he's going to like open a phone book or like change the page of a phone book.
[06:41.340 --> 06:42.160]  But really he was just...
[06:42.160 --> 06:42.760]  He was just blowing on it?
[06:42.760 --> 06:48.120]  Yeah, he's like essentially either blowing or like directing the wind of the room.
[06:48.320 --> 06:50.380]  Like he was just, it was clearly like he's just using the effect.
[06:50.460 --> 06:51.680]  I think he was blowing, as you said.
[06:52.040 --> 06:55.200]  So Randi put all these fucking little pieces of paper around it.
[06:55.600 --> 06:55.940]  Yeah, it's like packing peanuts.
[06:55.940 --> 06:58.840]  So it couldn't just, yeah, it couldn't just move the thing.
[06:59.280 --> 06:59.640]  It's great.
[06:59.980 --> 07:01.760]  And the guy is like, hmm.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.200]  No, yeah, I can't do it now for some reason.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.660]  He's like stint sick or something.
[07:06.040 --> 07:10.060]  There's a lot of strategic squatting by that guy in that video
[07:10.060 --> 07:14.200]  of like trying to get into the zone, like pretending he's like trying to get the right...
[07:14.200 --> 07:15.520]  He's dressed like a martial artist.
[07:15.860 --> 07:17.520]  He is, yeah. I forgot about that.
[07:18.060 --> 07:20.060]  But yeah, I'm very familiar with him. He's great.
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.100]  I'd never heard of the guy. That's funny. That's interesting.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.440]  Is he British or American?
[07:23.720 --> 07:24.620]  No, he died recently.
[07:25.160 --> 07:25.460]  He did.
[07:25.900 --> 07:27.300]  But did he die British or American?
[07:27.700 --> 07:28.080]  He was American.
[07:28.100 --> 07:28.560]  He was American.
[07:28.800 --> 07:29.420]  Oh, Canadian.
[07:30.380 --> 07:30.740]  Canadian?
[07:31.180 --> 07:32.380]  Oh, I don't know. Maybe American.
[07:32.880 --> 07:36.560]  I don't know, actually. I just know he's not British is actually the answer to that question.
[07:36.620 --> 07:37.540]  I don't know anything beyond that.
[07:40.060 --> 07:42.020]  Oh, Eric's typing Canadian-American.
[07:42.520 --> 07:43.400]  Well, there we go. We're both right.
[07:43.900 --> 07:47.440]  In the world of solving things, I want to talk about a thing really quickly.
[07:47.540 --> 07:50.220]  Because the episode we recorded last week, the first one aired,
[07:50.780 --> 07:53.660]  in which I talked about my shift key realization.
[07:54.040 --> 07:54.340]  Oh, yeah.
[07:54.440 --> 07:55.780]  I didn't know that shift could capitalize.
[07:55.980 --> 08:00.380]  A lot of people talking about it are saying they don't believe that that was a thing that I could do.
[08:01.080 --> 08:06.220]  And so I was fascinated because I genuinely didn't know that the shift capitalization was a thing.
[08:06.720 --> 08:07.920]  And how is this possible?
[08:07.920 --> 08:10.200]  And Gavin, you brought up the phone.
[08:10.380 --> 08:12.780]  The phone has the symbol for it.
[08:12.780 --> 08:12.960]  Yeah.
[08:12.960 --> 08:13.920]  Which I didn't really understand.
[08:14.280 --> 08:16.800]  So I'm going to pull up Tablet and get this ready.
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.760]  So I... that is only useful if you know that the shift key is supposed to capitalize.
[08:23.380 --> 08:23.800]  Right?
[08:23.940 --> 08:29.100]  So if you have no basis of that, even if the symbol is the same, that doesn't mean anything.
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.060]  I always interpreted that symbol as it's an uppercase.
[08:34.160 --> 08:35.600]  Like it's going to uppercase your letters.
[08:35.700 --> 08:36.780]  So that's my phone keyboard.
[08:36.780 --> 08:39.580]  It's not one-to-one to my real keyboard.
[08:41.480 --> 08:46.760]  So there's... I didn't view... so people have said like, oh, well the symbol's on the fucking keyboard.
[08:46.920 --> 08:48.180]  How did you not make that connection?
[08:48.520 --> 08:51.900]  I've used Mac keyboards almost my entire life.
[08:52.120 --> 08:53.940]  There's no symbol on the shift key.
[08:54.220 --> 08:55.480]  That symbol's not there.
[08:55.820 --> 08:57.640]  I don't use a PC keyboard.
[08:57.960 --> 08:59.660]  So you're saying you didn't know that was shift?
[08:59.860 --> 09:01.400]  I had no idea that was shift.
[09:01.400 --> 09:07.180]  So the... you've been using the shift key this entire time, you just didn't understand that it was shift?
[09:07.180 --> 09:13.240]  No, no. The only time I would use shift, I believe, is Control-Shift-4, where you can then search for a specific word.
[09:13.800 --> 09:19.540]  But I'm saying people saying, like you, Gavin, that symbol represents shift, not on any keyboard I've ever used.
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.720]  But you have to... it's in the same place. Like you have to go there to hit a capital letter.
[09:25.240 --> 09:25.760]  What do you mean?
[09:26.160 --> 09:29.900]  Like what's next to Z on a keyboard? On both keyboards.
[09:29.900 --> 09:37.340]  Yeah, but I had no idea that shift capitalized. I've only been using cap lock, and there's not a cap lock button on the phone keyboard.
[09:37.620 --> 09:43.600]  So I interpreted the up as the caps locks button, not the shift button, because that symbol means nothing.
[09:43.920 --> 09:47.360]  And I thought the upward arrow was like, we're uppercasing your letters.
[09:47.860 --> 09:48.240]  It is.
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.300]  It is saying it's uppercasing your letters.
[09:50.500 --> 09:53.620]  Yeah. So that's just... I just wanted to go over how this happens.
[09:53.620 --> 09:58.760]  So my point being is you've been uppercasing your letters with the shift button on your phone this entire time.
[09:58.760 --> 09:59.680]  You just thought it was a caps lock button.
[09:59.680 --> 10:00.660]  Not knowing it was a shift.
[10:01.040 --> 10:02.340]  You just thought it was a caps lock button.
[10:02.420 --> 10:06.160]  Yes, I thought that that was a caps lock button because I didn't know the shift did that.
[10:06.300 --> 10:07.160]  You might be right.
[10:07.280 --> 10:12.600]  Well, I mean, to be fair, they're built into each other. Like that is actually both keys on the phone.
[10:12.980 --> 10:14.780]  Yeah, if you double tap it, it locks it.
[10:14.800 --> 10:22.620]  That was what I didn't realize. I think on the podcast, we realized that I didn't understand that you could double tap the shift to caps lock.
[10:22.620 --> 10:28.400]  And I was manually holding it down each time I needed to type an all caps word.
[10:28.840 --> 10:32.180]  Did you know, Andrew, that if you double tap, it locks in the caps?
[10:32.600 --> 10:33.940]  No, I had no idea.
[10:34.460 --> 10:42.100]  If you knew that, I was going to say... I mean, technically, you're kind of correct because it serves the function of shift and caps lock.
[10:42.500 --> 10:46.720]  And so this entire time, if you've been using it as the caps lock, you've been using it correctly, I guess.
[10:46.860 --> 10:50.340]  So you can tell all the comment leavers that you were right and they were wrong.
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.820]  It's not even a right or wrong, it's more just how did I not make this connection before?
[10:55.100 --> 10:58.500]  And I saw a lot of people bringing up the symbol being on the shift key.
[10:59.080 --> 11:00.180]  And it's not for my keyboard.
[11:00.340 --> 11:04.040]  I got an earful from minor league fan Jack just this morning about that.
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.560]  I was going to say the same. Yeah, he's Andrew, your biggest doubter.
[11:07.900 --> 11:13.920]  He pulled me aside when I came into work yesterday and he was like, so that shift thing's bullshit, right?
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.240]  Like, there's no way. And I was like, look, I think it's real.
[11:17.240 --> 11:23.700]  I don't... I would've gone on... what I'm curious about is how long it would've taken me to ever realize that.
[11:23.980 --> 11:29.040]  The only reason why I figured out the shift thing, because I was talking to someone,
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.300]  and I was like, don't you hate when you cap lock and you hit the wrong... like it's out of sequence?
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.600]  So the first letter's small and all the other ones are capitalized?
[11:38.160 --> 11:41.100]  And they explained to me, they said, you don't use the shift? And I had no idea.
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.040]  No fucking clue. It's just something I didn't learn. I don't know how I didn't learn that the shift didn't.
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.760]  I don't have an answer for that, but I genuinely had no idea that if you held shift it capitalized letters.
[11:51.140 --> 11:53.940]  Well, I mean, there's also a way around your problem too. In what way?
[11:54.340 --> 11:58.560]  Like when you're... Jesus. Like when you're out of sync. Like you can... what is it?
[11:58.620 --> 12:03.480]  It's like shift and F3 or something and it like flips the capitalization of all the letters.
[12:03.940 --> 12:09.240]  That's not real. I think it's real. Is it shift F3? Or something. I used to use it in Word.
[12:09.240 --> 12:16.340]  I guess I don't... I know one keyboard shortcut and it's ctrl shift 4. Outside of that, I'm never using that shift button.
[12:17.780 --> 12:21.160]  Dude, you should give shift a spin. It is awesome.
[12:21.640 --> 12:29.940]  I tried. Like once I heard, I'm still caps locking because it just feels more natural because I've been typing by hitting caps lock on the singular capitalization for most of my life.
[12:30.280 --> 12:31.460]  I guess all my life I've been typing.
[12:31.460 --> 12:40.080]  I'll say this. You figured out how to use a video game controller wrong and you're way better than I am at video games. So I'm not going to judge how you do it.
[12:40.460 --> 12:46.280]  Yeah, that was another weird thing where I didn't realize that there was another way to hold the controller. It just seemed obvious that you would do that.
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.080]  It blew my mind when you're like, no, I have both thumbs on the analog sticks.
[12:50.620 --> 12:51.620]  Wait, what are you...
[12:52.080 --> 12:53.300]  He's a claw guy.
[12:53.580 --> 12:57.700]  Yeah, I guess it's called the claw. I didn't realize that until after I used it.
[12:57.740 --> 12:59.300]  So you like fingers on analog stick?
[12:59.820 --> 13:05.480]  Well, I guess I have my thumbs are on the analog stick and then I bend my finger to cover all the buttons.
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.120]  I guess the issue is more that Geoff removes the ability to look around.
[13:09.580 --> 13:13.940]  Like when you hit a button, he uses his thumb so then you can't move your head and then shooters.
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.680]  So I just bend my finger over to cover all the buttons. I never have to...
[13:18.680 --> 13:19.360]  Yeah, that's why you're better.
[13:19.860 --> 13:20.080]  Yeah.
[13:20.640 --> 13:23.560]  You can avoid that actually with the paddles now and the elite controllers.
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.280]  That's the thing. I own an elite controller, but I never use the paddles because I already just do that with my fingers.
[13:29.280 --> 13:31.900]  I don't have much of a use for the paddle system.
[13:32.400 --> 13:36.780]  I don't like those paddles. It's overcomplicated. And if you slam your controller down, they fly off.
[13:36.920 --> 13:37.980]  That's how I feel about the shift.
[13:40.200 --> 13:41.600]  Shift doesn't go anywhere, buddy.
[13:42.180 --> 13:47.640]  No, it doesn't. It stays on. It's not like that game where you have to put the symbols in before it explodes.
[13:47.860 --> 13:52.200]  I'd love if keyboards did that, but I just the point of it's overcomplicated in my head.
[13:52.260 --> 13:54.880]  I just hit the caps lock key. Then I hit it again. It's not a big deal.
[13:54.880 --> 14:00.160]  You're just describing something more complicated because you have to do two things.
[14:00.480 --> 14:03.640]  That's fun. Who doesn't like hitting a button? I love hitting a button.
[14:05.620 --> 14:08.620]  I'm gonna go on record, Andrew, and say that I believe you.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.960]  Even though not many of the comment leavers and certainly not Minor League Jack do.
[14:13.980 --> 14:17.720]  I think that you're being totally honest and I can see how it would happen.
[14:17.720 --> 14:27.440]  As someone who still has the Roman numeral problem, I completely and totally can see how you would miss this little bit of information.
[14:27.640 --> 14:31.760]  And then you look up and it's so many years later and you beat all of Crackdown without autolock.
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.160]  I didn't know about this Roman numeral problem that you have until last week.
[14:38.140 --> 14:39.320]  It's been a big deal my whole life.
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.960]  But why don't you just sit down and learn them for like an hour?
[14:42.980 --> 14:46.320]  Dude, I tried. I don't know if I told you this or if I mentioned it.
[14:46.320 --> 14:52.300]  I feel like I've talked about the Roman numeral issue so many times it's over-talked across podcasts and stuff.
[14:52.360 --> 14:56.720]  But I used to have a laminated card in my wallet that I could use as a quick reference.
[14:58.500 --> 15:06.240]  Really? You only need to know between 1 and 12. Anything else is bullshit, really.
[15:06.640 --> 15:08.240]  I mean, until you get to the Super Bowl.
[15:08.740 --> 15:13.100]  The Super Bowl had like L, didn't it?
[15:13.100 --> 15:13.560]  50?
[15:15.200 --> 15:22.120]  I bet I like college football better than pro football subconsciously because the Super Bowl confuses me.
[15:22.700 --> 15:24.540]  There's no Roman numerals in college football.
[15:25.340 --> 15:28.320]  I like it's the least important detail, though, of the Super Bowl.
[15:29.420 --> 15:30.060]  Is it?
[15:30.580 --> 15:32.900]  I think it is the number of which one it is.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.640]  I think it's important to know when it is.
[15:34.860 --> 15:37.240]  Like what Super Bowl it is.
[15:37.540 --> 15:41.440]  I don't feel... well, I guess you could make an argument for that, but I feel it's more key-based.
[15:41.440 --> 15:42.480]  V is not a number?
[15:43.040 --> 15:44.020]  If somebody tells me...
[15:44.020 --> 15:45.100]  V is not a number?
[15:45.920 --> 15:46.480]  O is a number.
[15:47.120 --> 15:47.400]  Yes.
[15:47.600 --> 15:48.280]  O is a number.
[15:48.500 --> 15:56.120]  If somebody says like LV1, I won't know what that means, but if they're like the Chiefs Patriots Super Bowl, I will know what that is.
[15:56.460 --> 16:01.240]  What annoys me about Roman numerals is the imbalance around a letter.
[16:01.240 --> 16:14.460]  So like a 4 will be like IV, like 1 before the 5, and then you have 5, and then you have 5i, and then also 5i, and then 5ii.
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.500]  Like, why isn't it 2 either side? Instead, it's 1 one way and 3 the other.
[16:18.680 --> 16:19.860]  Yeah, it's stupid.
[16:20.380 --> 16:21.020]  It's pretty mental.
[16:22.580 --> 16:27.080]  It's too confusing for a fully formed adult brain to work out.
[16:27.080 --> 16:34.340]  They need to get you in the 3rd grade when you still haven't cemented all those connections, when you're still moldable.
[16:34.420 --> 16:36.280]  Because now, I can't... it's nonsense.
[16:36.780 --> 16:42.320]  I had a friend at school who thought... he'd only read it, he'd never seen it aloud.
[16:42.920 --> 16:45.960]  He thought the guy's name was Henry Ville, but it was Henry VIII.
[16:56.060 --> 16:58.740]  Gavin, I ran into you... by the way, this is getting weird.
[16:59.120 --> 17:07.520]  I ran into you at the office this morning, where I was going to record my audio-only podcast that I do that's not this one.
[17:07.520 --> 17:16.980]  And then we said hi to each other, and then we agreed to hang out later when we both leave work to come home to record this audio-only podcast.
[17:17.640 --> 17:20.700]  Well, we can't record in person without Andrew, because of the imbalance.
[17:21.060 --> 17:25.380]  I agree with that, and also... I don't know, man.
[17:25.640 --> 17:30.960]  Even if I could at work, I feel in my zone here for this podcast.
[17:31.360 --> 17:34.380]  I feel safe. I've got all my treasures around me.
[17:36.280 --> 17:39.600]  I've got all my baseball cards, I've got my egg card, I'm ready to go.
[17:44.620 --> 17:48.380]  I feel like you also just need that environment, because it's such a big part of the show.
[17:48.500 --> 17:53.320]  It took forever to build your moving episodes because of it, hitting your head on the desk.
[17:53.840 --> 17:55.680]  It's the character, I'd say.
[17:55.700 --> 18:00.500]  That's a good point. It is funny, though, to run into Gavin at work and then agree to go home so we can work.
[18:02.540 --> 18:07.560]  Yeah, you joined us while we were scooting around on our various segways and one-wheels.
[18:08.260 --> 18:14.700]  Two days in a row, I've come into the office, now that we're starting to emerge from our pandemic caves.
[18:15.360 --> 18:19.320]  And two days in a row, I've been at the office and seen you at the office.
[18:19.660 --> 18:22.700]  And for a brief moment, I almost felt like we worked for a real company again.
[18:23.100 --> 18:23.500]  Yeah.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.980]  And then I got on my bicycle and I rode home.
[18:26.860 --> 18:30.120]  We did a pretty good prank on the meeting you were in yesterday.
[18:31.660 --> 18:33.900]  Very, very... can we talk? Yeah, this hasn't come out for a while, right?
[18:34.480 --> 18:36.440]  Yeah, this will be two weeks from now.
[18:36.500 --> 18:36.900]  Yeah, over a week.
[18:36.940 --> 18:42.980]  We were in a meeting... who cares? I like this podcast better than whatever that was anyway.
[18:50.520 --> 18:55.080]  And plus, I created that other thing, too, so I can call seniority and say it makes more sense to be here.
[18:56.060 --> 19:00.980]  We were in a meeting about... ah, just like a bullshit, you know, admin meeting kind of stuff.
[19:01.140 --> 19:08.600]  And we had minor league fan Jack in to talk about this charity that he runs every November that raises a bunch of money for sick kids.
[19:09.300 --> 19:13.000]  And we're in there for about 30-40 minutes. He was supposed to come in and talk for about 5 minutes.
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.000]  It ran about 40 minutes of just, you know...
[19:16.000 --> 19:16.340]  Oh, dear.
[19:16.680 --> 19:17.260]  Good lord.
[19:17.600 --> 19:22.720]  And then when he finally gets up to leave, it's a glass office on three... I guess on two walls.
[19:22.720 --> 19:23.700]  The other two walls are solid.
[19:23.880 --> 19:31.140]  But the glass is frosted, so you kind of... you know, you can see colors and shapes, but you can't really see what's going on.
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.960]  And we were just focused on the charity and all the important work that we were doing.
[19:35.620 --> 19:41.860]  And minor league fan Jack gets up and the door opens... you know, he opens up the door to walk out and walks right into a giant fridge.
[19:42.940 --> 19:47.140]  You guys had moved an entire refrigerator perfectly in front of the door.
[19:47.300 --> 19:49.080]  And so then he just walked right into it.
[19:49.200 --> 19:49.880]  It was very funny.
[19:49.960 --> 19:51.120]  Actually, the fridge is on wheels.
[19:51.120 --> 19:53.360]  Yeah, we're back in the mode of just like videos.
[19:53.640 --> 19:56.880]  This is what we miss being at home, really. Videos just can spontaneously happen.
[19:57.200 --> 19:58.420]  We're making a video about something else.
[19:58.440 --> 20:00.500]  And then I decided to try and move the fridge.
[20:00.740 --> 20:02.900]  And then I thought it'd be a good idea to block the door with it.
[20:02.980 --> 20:05.020]  And it was very enjoyable.
[20:05.520 --> 20:08.080]  And then we replaced the real fridge with Matt.
[20:10.180 --> 20:15.060]  We just gave him all the stuff from the fridge and he had to give it out to people if they wanted to drink it.
[20:17.860 --> 20:22.560]  But in that meeting, Gavin, when we ran into each other, you mentioned that you had a bunch of stuff to talk about today.
[20:23.020 --> 20:23.260]  Really?
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.380]  Oh, nice. I've got some stuff left over.
[20:25.540 --> 20:26.360]  Actually, I've got some new stuff.
[20:26.600 --> 20:33.200]  I had one of those moments again where you sort of think you're in a simulation because there's just too much coincidence happening at once.
[20:33.640 --> 20:34.060]  You ever get those?
[20:34.540 --> 20:34.780]  Yeah.
[20:35.380 --> 20:36.660]  Meg was streaming the other night.
[20:36.720 --> 20:39.620]  She was playing some Nancy Drew game.
[20:40.380 --> 20:45.040]  And because we've been watching so much Survivor, we haven't really had a chance to watch movies recently.
[20:45.040 --> 20:46.160]  So I thought, oh, we'll watch a movie.
[20:46.200 --> 20:47.960]  But she had to finish that game.
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.760]  She wanted to get through the whole thing.
[20:49.900 --> 20:51.320]  And by the time she finished, it was quite late.
[20:51.420 --> 20:55.800]  So I thought, well, let's watch a 90 minute comedy or something.
[20:55.880 --> 20:58.280]  We settled on Airplane, which I hadn't seen in a long time.
[20:58.620 --> 20:59.180]  Great movie.
[20:59.900 --> 21:01.040]  And I was talking to her before.
[21:01.140 --> 21:03.660]  I was like, oh, so you actually had to finish that game.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  You couldn't just do it in segments.
[21:06.080 --> 21:08.340]  She was like, no, it's better if you finish it because it's like a murder mystery.
[21:08.580 --> 21:10.220]  And she was like, you know what Nancy Drew is?
[21:10.280 --> 21:12.700]  I was like, no, I don't really know about Nancy Drew.
[21:12.780 --> 21:13.980]  She's like, well, it's like the Hardy Boys.
[21:13.980 --> 21:14.800]  I was like, yeah, I don't know.
[21:14.840 --> 21:15.720]  I just, I'll be honest.
[21:15.760 --> 21:20.280]  The only reason I've heard of that is because Coolio rapped about it
[21:20.280 --> 21:22.040]  in the Keenan and Kel theme song.
[21:23.520 --> 21:24.960]  And she was like, you're having a laugh.
[21:25.060 --> 21:25.820]  You must, you must know.
[21:25.880 --> 21:27.960]  I was like, no, seriously, that's the only reason I know those names.
[21:28.540 --> 21:30.980]  Then we're watching, um, Airplane.
[21:31.340 --> 21:33.200]  And there's that scene in the cockpit where like,
[21:33.200 --> 21:35.200]  everyone has a confusing name for a cockpit.
[21:35.360 --> 21:36.480]  So you've got like Captain Over.
[21:36.800 --> 21:38.180]  You got someone called Roger.
[21:38.640 --> 21:38.900]  Yeah.
[21:39.040 --> 21:39.840]  Someone else called Victor.
[21:40.020 --> 21:41.460]  And they're like, oh, what's your vector, Victor?
[21:41.460 --> 21:42.560]  And so he's like, oh, you're over.
[21:42.700 --> 21:43.020]  Oh, what?
[21:43.120 --> 21:43.580]  Oh, Roger.
[21:43.780 --> 21:44.740]  And Roger's like, huh?
[21:44.800 --> 21:46.260]  And it's just all that confusing stuff.
[21:46.600 --> 21:50.820]  And Meg's like, oh, they're doing like a funny, uh, Abbott and Costello bit.
[21:51.340 --> 21:54.340]  And I was like, oh, I've never seen any of that.
[21:54.480 --> 21:56.320]  She's like, oh, you know, Abbott and Costello.
[21:56.460 --> 21:59.400]  And I was like, I'll be like, I'll be honest with you.
[22:01.360 --> 22:04.740]  I've only heard, I've only heard of Abbott and Costello
[22:04.740 --> 22:07.600]  cause Coolea rapped about it in the Keenan and Kel.
[22:09.660 --> 22:11.280]  Where it goes through double X.
[22:11.900 --> 22:15.040]  So then she was like, all right, you're having a, you're having a laugh now.
[22:17.860 --> 22:22.860]  So then I got up the lyrics to Keenan and Kel and I was like, oh, here's the bit.
[22:23.020 --> 22:27.100]  And Coolea goes, this ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery.
[22:27.300 --> 22:29.540]  It's just Keenan and Kel in your vicinity.
[22:29.840 --> 22:32.380]  Like Siegfried and Roy or Abbott and Costello.
[22:32.380 --> 22:35.200]  Magic and Kareem or Penn and Teller.
[22:35.260 --> 22:39.640]  And then I realized I paused the movie and I looked at the, I looked at the TV.
[22:39.960 --> 22:44.520]  It's, it's fricking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in that scene.
[22:44.980 --> 22:47.680]  He plays Roger Murdoch, the guy in the cockpit.
[22:48.160 --> 22:53.640]  And I was like, why is everything in my life right now in the Keenan and Kel song?
[22:54.060 --> 22:55.020]  I was, I'll be honest.
[22:55.060 --> 22:58.920]  I was half expecting Penn Jillette to fall through my ceiling.
[22:59.060 --> 23:00.660]  I was like, what is going on?
[23:00.660 --> 23:03.020]  We were both like, jaw open.
[23:03.220 --> 23:04.720]  Like, what is happening right now?
[23:05.340 --> 23:06.380]  I'm in a simulation.
[23:06.780 --> 23:10.000]  Is there a line in the Keenan and Kel rap about how the shift key works?
[23:10.080 --> 23:14.040]  Cause I have not heard, I've not heard the rap and that could have helped me.
[23:14.320 --> 23:14.800]  There is.
[23:15.840 --> 23:18.200]  Were you wearing socks at this point?
[23:22.660 --> 23:24.320]  Anyway, Airplane, still a funny movie.
[23:24.640 --> 23:25.720]  Airplane holds up really well.
[23:25.720 --> 23:28.780]  I actually took Millie, my daughter, to see it in the theater.
[23:29.740 --> 23:31.700]  I guess 2019, summer 2019.
[23:32.280 --> 23:38.920]  And it was, well, first off, a 15 year old kid has no frame of reference for 98% of those jokes.
[23:39.100 --> 23:40.320]  But still very funny.
[23:40.520 --> 23:45.760]  And the thing that you forget about that movie and their style of humor is that there's a joke every five seconds.
[23:48.340 --> 23:50.740]  It's like those Zucker Brothers movies.
[23:50.740 --> 23:55.700]  They've done all the, I guess, Naked Gun and I think they're involved in basketball and stuff.
[23:55.800 --> 23:59.320]  There's just like a visual gag or a joke every six seconds.
[23:59.700 --> 24:04.980]  They've got like a JPM minimum of like 30 jokes a minute or something. It's ridiculous.
[24:05.340 --> 24:15.160]  Also, I realized from, I found out afterwards that all those people in that movie, like Lloyd Bridges and Phelps, whatever his name is, and Leslie Nielsen.
[24:15.700 --> 24:18.360]  They'd never had comedic roles before that movie.
[24:18.900 --> 24:24.960]  They were all like really serious actors and it reinvigorated all of their careers as comedy dudes.
[24:25.380 --> 24:29.760]  Yeah, and Nielsen ended up having, his second act was way bigger than his first because of all that.
[24:30.080 --> 24:38.760]  I view him as a comedy actor and I viewed Creepshow as like, oh, that's a weird exception to the rule where he plays like kind of a sinister murdering character.
[24:38.880 --> 24:41.880]  Not realizing that that's what his career was for a time.
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.540]  Dude, Creepshow is a great movie.
[24:43.540 --> 24:48.800]  Meteor shit. I used to say that to myself all the time. Meteor shit.
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.780]  I didn't realize that Airplane was a parody of Airport until I watched Airport.
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.540]  I had no idea that those, I just thought Airplane was a funny movie that was not spoofing anything else.
[24:59.780 --> 25:03.700]  I thought it was a bizarre comedy. It was strange to watch Airport and be like, oh, this is Airplane.
[25:04.220 --> 25:05.220]  So what was Zero Hour?
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.260]  Is that, because they made multiple airports, is there an airport called Zero Hour?
[25:10.720 --> 25:11.040]  I don't know.
[25:11.040 --> 25:14.380]  I thought it was like a trilogy. Airport is like a weirdly big movie.
[25:14.780 --> 25:15.620]  I've never seen it.
[25:15.980 --> 25:17.060]  Zero Hour is the other movie, right?
[25:17.540 --> 25:18.620]  I thought that was what Airplane was based on.
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.420]  That's the one that had like all the combat stuff is based on, right?
[25:22.560 --> 25:26.820]  But the main guy in Zero Hour is Ted Stryker, who's also the main guy in Airplane.
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.700]  Right, like that part, the Stryker stuff is based off Zero Hour, but I think a lot of the other stuff is based off Airport. It's like a combination.
[25:35.380 --> 25:37.040]  What percentage of the f*** face...
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.160]  What year did that, hold on a second, what year did Airplane come out?
[25:41.440 --> 25:42.400]  It was like 1980.
[25:43.200 --> 25:44.920]  We're talking about a movie...
[25:44.920 --> 25:45.820]  It's before my time.
[25:46.180 --> 25:50.080]  We're talking about a movie that came out years and years and years before y'all were born.
[25:50.180 --> 25:52.000]  I was five and I'm a thousand.
[25:52.640 --> 25:55.400]  Like, we probably should move on to something this century.
[25:55.400 --> 26:00.020]  You don't think many of the people listening have listened to 1970s Airport?
[26:00.460 --> 26:03.600]  You don't think they've seen Dean Martin as a pilot before?
[26:04.460 --> 26:05.440]  I think maybe not.
[26:05.440 --> 26:06.500]  But I think they should.
[26:06.840 --> 26:07.300]  They should.
[26:07.580 --> 26:08.620]  Well, they should watch Airplane.
[26:08.700 --> 26:10.440]  Airport not really needed to watch.
[26:10.480 --> 26:11.600]  It's okay. It's very fine.
[26:16.310 --> 26:17.230]  Hello, Tushy.
[26:17.610 --> 26:18.590]  And hello, audience.
[26:18.930 --> 26:24.310]  I am here to talk to you about the modern bidet company that is washing away all of your problems.
[26:24.830 --> 26:26.930]  All of your poop-related problems.
[26:27.370 --> 26:29.590]  Is your butt clean enough to sit on the couch naked?
[26:29.710 --> 26:32.170]  If not, you need to get a Tushy.
[26:32.370 --> 26:37.150]  The modern bidet that attaches directly to your toilet in under ten minutes.
[26:37.150 --> 26:38.310]  Think about it.
[26:38.690 --> 26:42.170]  If you ever got poop on any part of your body, you wouldn't just wipe it off.
[26:42.330 --> 26:43.270]  No, you'd wash it.
[26:43.550 --> 26:44.650]  You'd wash the hell out of it.
[26:44.870 --> 26:51.090]  So stop wiping the poop off your butt and start washing it with a Tushy modern bidet.
[26:51.410 --> 26:53.510]  It's the bidet for people who poop.
[26:53.790 --> 26:55.690]  Just poop wash and pat dry.
[26:56.150 --> 26:57.690]  Let me just throw some of these features your way.
[26:57.970 --> 27:00.930]  It washes your bum with water for a better clean than toilet paper.
[27:01.310 --> 27:01.590]  Duh.
[27:01.910 --> 27:05.730]  And washing with water is less irritating and more soothing for your butthole.
[27:05.810 --> 27:06.630]  I can attest to that.
[27:06.630 --> 27:10.310]  I would testify to Congress over that fact.
[27:10.470 --> 27:11.010]  Let me tell ya.
[27:11.290 --> 27:12.430]  It's also easy to install.
[27:12.650 --> 27:14.870]  It attaches to the toilet in just under ten minutes.
[27:14.970 --> 27:17.330]  I said that earlier, but it's so important I said it again.
[27:17.610 --> 27:19.730]  There is no electricity or plumbing needed.
[27:20.230 --> 27:24.710]  Using a Tushy bidet reduces your toilet paper use by 80%, which saves you money.
[27:24.970 --> 27:27.510]  And it's eco-friendly and stylish, which is important.
[27:27.970 --> 27:30.850]  So start washing with a Tushy bidet for a better clean.

[27:51.830 --> 27:53.470]  Life is full of stress.
[27:53.710 --> 27:57.990]  It doesn't matter who you are or what you have, your life is probably stressful.
[27:58.470 --> 28:00.910]  I know, uh, that I, I mean, listen.
[28:01.290 --> 28:03.270]  You've seen the two idiots I have to work with.
[28:03.270 --> 28:07.250]  If you think I'm not going through stressful times, then you're crazy.
[28:07.750 --> 28:13.110]  And you may not even be feeling down and out or like straight up depressed or like you're at a total loss.
[28:13.250 --> 28:20.010]  But if your stress is high and your temper is a little shorter than usual, I know I've experienced that, uh, on camera a few times.
[28:20.110 --> 28:28.290]  Or even if you're starting to feel strain in any of your relationships like mine with Gavin and Andrew, you could probably use a chance to unload.
[28:28.530 --> 28:30.150]  That's where BetterHelp comes in.
[28:30.150 --> 28:36.190]  It is customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with your therapist.
[28:36.570 --> 28:39.110]  So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[28:39.350 --> 28:44.950]  It's also much more affordable than in-person therapy and you can start communicating with your therapist in under 48 hours.
[28:45.330 --> 28:48.590]  So unload the stressors in life and get some unbiased feedback.
[28:48.890 --> 28:51.110]  You'd be pretty surprised at what you might gain from it.
[28:51.350 --> 28:53.330]  At least give it a shot and see if it's for you.

[29:07.910 --> 29:12.610]  God, I was, uh, I was looking at my notes, uh, of stuff that I have to talk about today.
[29:12.670 --> 29:14.670]  I don't have a lot and so I was going to lean on Gavin.
[29:15.070 --> 29:18.490]  Uh, I do have one funny, one funny, one very quick small story.
[29:18.870 --> 29:22.950]  Uh, and then we can talk about how I'm going to Vegas this weekend for you, Andrew.
[29:22.950 --> 29:24.770]  And so we should discuss that maybe.
[29:25.410 --> 29:29.490]  Uh, but also, Andrew, and I don't know if we want to get into it, uh, we still have superhero.
[29:29.790 --> 29:35.650]  But then under it and while Gavin was talking, was talking about airport, I was reading and I just, it just hit me.
[29:36.150 --> 29:40.070]  I had no idea what this note meant, but I wrote down just the word crabbing.
[29:40.130 --> 29:44.310]  And it took me most of this podcast to remember why I wrote that down.
[29:44.630 --> 29:44.810]  Yeah.
[29:44.910 --> 29:45.410]  Can I guess?
[29:46.010 --> 29:46.370]  Please.
[29:46.370 --> 29:53.290]  Uh, you were, you were trying to think of other words for theft, like scrumping.
[29:53.530 --> 29:56.710]  And you discovered that crabs, when you steal a crab is crabbing.
[29:57.390 --> 30:10.030]  No, we were, Andrew and I were having, I wouldn't say a disagreement, but we were having a conversation about, uh, I guess like a strategy, like a surrounding podcast.
[30:10.550 --> 30:12.310]  Like a behind the scenes work kind of strategy.
[30:12.450 --> 30:13.870]  And we were kind of talking through it.
[30:13.870 --> 30:20.250]  And he made an analogy about, uh, how, when you go crabbing, you leave your crab traps.
[30:20.370 --> 30:21.970]  You don't put all your crab traps in the same spot.
[30:22.070 --> 30:24.310]  You set them out, uh, in a, uh, around.
[30:24.430 --> 30:28.270]  So you have a wider, it's essentially casting a wider net, a wider crab net, as it were.
[30:28.610 --> 30:35.470]  And I got it in my head that I thought it would be really funny if we all went crabbing together because I've never been crabbing.
[30:35.530 --> 30:36.430]  I don't even like crabs.
[30:36.910 --> 30:38.930]  I guarantee you've never been crabbing.
[30:39.210 --> 30:42.190]  Andrew and I both decided there's no way Gavin's ever been crabbing.
[30:42.270 --> 30:43.530]  And he's never been crabbing.
[30:43.530 --> 30:46.910]  I don't even know what it entails or what I would do with crabs if I caught him.
[30:47.290 --> 30:55.010]  But the idea of going crabbing with my two best friends, an activity that none of us have done before, I'm assuming, sounds really fun to me.
[30:55.070 --> 30:57.930]  So I think we should all go crabbing in Vancouver Island someday.
[30:58.370 --> 31:03.270]  I think an important note too for our text is I made the crab netting analogy.
[31:03.890 --> 31:06.170]  And then Geoff asked, have I gone crabbing before?
[31:06.310 --> 31:09.310]  And I replied, no, and I have no idea how it works.
[31:09.350 --> 31:11.110]  That was a wild analogy for me to make.
[31:11.110 --> 31:14.270]  I actually don't know anything that I'm saying regarding this topic.
[31:14.870 --> 31:17.350]  I agree. We should do this at some point.
[31:17.430 --> 31:21.870]  There should just be a list of things we haven't done that we're not enthusiastic about doing.
[31:22.050 --> 31:26.010]  And then we have to do them or we have to assign those tasks to one of us.
[31:26.110 --> 31:30.750]  We need to order because there's a lot we have to get done at the moment we set foot on Vancouver Island.
[31:30.890 --> 31:32.110]  We've got to get straight to work.
[31:32.190 --> 31:33.650]  There's not enough time to do everything.
[31:34.090 --> 31:36.570]  You can watch the bathtub races while crabbing for the doc.
[31:37.910 --> 31:41.110]  It's got to be there, though, because we don't have crabs in Austin.
[31:41.310 --> 31:42.150]  It's not crab country.
[31:42.450 --> 31:45.810]  You know, I will say we've already got the perfect receptacle for crabs.
[31:46.430 --> 31:47.930]  Yeah. What is it? You made it.
[31:48.210 --> 31:48.930]  You made it, Andrew.
[31:49.290 --> 31:50.310]  Oh, the basket.
[31:50.570 --> 31:51.670]  Yeah, you got the basket.
[31:52.330 --> 31:53.330]  No, that's true.
[31:53.430 --> 31:59.750]  Yeah. Could you imagine the expression on everybody's faces if they saw us lower that into the water?
[32:01.170 --> 32:04.130]  Why are you dunking that tumbleweed into the water?
[32:06.790 --> 32:14.730]  If you think about it, though, if there was a Venn diagram of like Andrew, you're 26 now, 27, 26, 27, 27 now.
[32:14.830 --> 32:16.250]  And Gavin, you're 32.
[32:16.670 --> 32:17.010]  33.
[32:17.410 --> 32:18.470]  33. 33 now.
[32:18.750 --> 32:20.530]  I'm trying to give you guys each a year.
[32:20.610 --> 32:23.390]  I'm sorry. You just you're getting up there and it's gross.
[32:23.510 --> 32:24.310]  So I'm trying to help you out.
[32:24.490 --> 32:25.030]  I'm 46.
[32:25.590 --> 32:33.650]  That's the combined amount of time is I don't know the math on that, but probably close to 100 or around 100 years of combined activities.
[32:33.650 --> 32:40.210]  So the Venn diagram of of things that haven't been done by all three of us has got to be pretty small.
[32:41.290 --> 32:42.950]  I don't think that's true at all.
[32:43.110 --> 32:44.930]  I think it's very wide.
[32:44.930 --> 32:51.990]  I think you'd be surprised at how many things you've done that you don't realize that when you throw out an activity, you're like, oh, no, I did do that once.
[32:52.410 --> 32:54.850]  Have you ever skinned a rabbit?
[32:58.630 --> 33:01.290]  No, but I've seen it done in person.
[33:01.670 --> 33:02.210]  It's gross.
[33:02.610 --> 33:03.070]  Andrew?
[33:03.070 --> 33:04.170]  I've seen it in video games.
[33:04.270 --> 33:05.850]  Does that count for anything?
[33:06.130 --> 33:07.470]  I watched Roger and me.
[33:07.910 --> 33:08.650]  Arthur Morgan.
[33:09.170 --> 33:10.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[33:10.890 --> 33:12.590]  No, I don't think I mean, it's also wild.
[33:12.730 --> 33:16.790]  You need to factor in when you're evaluating this experience chart that you've made, Geoff.
[33:16.890 --> 33:20.330]  I haven't just tried scrambled eggs or a glass of milk.
[33:20.390 --> 33:24.370]  Like my contribution to the range of experience is narrow.
[33:24.870 --> 33:26.570]  It's more like two and a quarter person.
[33:27.070 --> 33:28.090]  I understand that.
[33:28.170 --> 33:28.890]  I understand that.
[33:28.930 --> 33:31.810]  But you knew who James Randi was and I had no fucking clue.
[33:31.810 --> 33:35.530]  So there are you have you are a keeper of knowledge and experience.
[33:35.830 --> 33:36.950]  I'm surprised by that.
[33:37.590 --> 33:43.350]  No, I thought honestly, when you did that, I thought you knew and you were testing me to see if I did.
[33:43.450 --> 33:45.670]  I didn't know it was the reverse of you not knowing.
[33:45.790 --> 33:48.870]  No, I assumed you wouldn't know who he was.
[33:49.030 --> 33:52.650]  And he was like some British personality that we don't know here in America.
[33:52.850 --> 33:56.730]  I didn't I didn't I didn't account for the fact that he he was Canadian.
[33:57.470 --> 33:59.010]  He did work a lot in the UK, though.
[33:59.070 --> 34:00.830]  I watched a bunch of English shit he was in.
[34:00.830 --> 34:08.990]  I would say the if you took if you took every activity on Earth and then applied our Venn diagram of all the stuff that we've all done.
[34:09.190 --> 34:13.950]  I would say ninety nine percent of things have been done by none of us.
[34:14.390 --> 34:16.590]  Yes. Well, then we better get to work is what I'm saying.
[34:17.070 --> 34:18.590]  We got a lot of shit to do.
[34:18.790 --> 34:23.350]  I say we start with crabbing and then we just find out what else.
[34:23.530 --> 34:28.410]  Naturally, we don't have to go looking for it, but we find out what else fits in, like fits in the center of that diagram.
[34:28.410 --> 34:30.650]  That's never been touched by the three of us.
[34:30.710 --> 34:32.870]  It's like a set and leave sort of thing, though, right?
[34:33.210 --> 34:37.090]  Yeah, but you put like on boots and then you clomp around in the mud and the water.
[34:37.250 --> 34:40.570]  And I'm assuming somebody will fall down and that'll be funny.
[34:40.850 --> 34:42.130]  You need to do that.
[34:42.430 --> 34:51.630]  I think from what I feel like I've observed of crabbing, you can just walk to the end of like a pier and drop a basket in and then just pull it up.
[34:51.870 --> 34:52.890]  You think it's that fast?
[34:53.450 --> 34:55.670]  Well, yeah, I think it depends.
[34:55.990 --> 34:58.150]  You just wait for a bite? You just wait for the line to move?
[34:58.570 --> 35:00.870]  I think you wait like 20 minutes would be my guess.
[35:00.970 --> 35:04.590]  And then you pull the basket up and if there are crabs, you're like, sweet, you put them in the bucket.
[35:04.810 --> 35:06.870]  And if they're not, you just throw the thing back into the water.
[35:07.110 --> 35:09.790]  I'll be honest, I thought you just went up to a crab pool and just picked up a crab.
[35:09.930 --> 35:11.830]  I thought, why didn't you need anything else?
[35:11.950 --> 35:11.990]  What do you mean?
[35:12.370 --> 35:12.690]  What?
[35:13.570 --> 35:15.290]  You got those little shallows where the rocks let?
[35:16.050 --> 35:18.770]  You're gonna fucking go crabbing with your hands?
[35:19.190 --> 35:21.750]  They got blades on their arms.
[35:22.830 --> 35:23.950]  From the back.
[35:24.390 --> 35:27.870]  That's a risky game. If you're going into a pool, they're coming from all angles.
[35:28.030 --> 35:28.970]  What are you talking about?
[35:29.030 --> 35:30.470]  There could be a tech in your leg.
[35:30.610 --> 35:33.270]  It's gonna be like Jurassic whatever the second one was.
[35:33.270 --> 35:35.590]  That's where your Achilles tendon is, dude. They're gonna take you down.
[35:36.230 --> 35:38.490]  You're at your most vulnerable right there.
[35:39.350 --> 35:40.770]  Gavin's gonna be like, this is no problem.
[35:40.910 --> 35:43.670]  He's gonna be like Peter Stormare in fucking Jurassic 2.
[35:43.910 --> 35:45.690]  And there's gonna be a million crabs on him.
[35:45.750 --> 35:47.090]  He's gonna be fucking devoured.
[35:47.950 --> 35:52.070]  All of a sudden I've dived over a log and then just a load of blood floats back up to the water.
[35:54.030 --> 36:02.350]  Look, I think if we all go crabbing, I bet I can pick up a crab with my bare hands faster than you can faff about with your boots and your little cubers.
[36:02.350 --> 36:06.890]  There's all kinds of crabbing activities that we can do.
[36:07.490 --> 36:10.350]  We'll have all kinds of crabbing competitions.
[36:10.770 --> 36:16.150]  I remember, Andrew, I thought you said you were gonna mosey on down to the pier one day and sit and watch for a while and take notes.
[36:16.150 --> 36:17.330]  Or did I make that up?
[36:17.830 --> 36:19.930]  Maybe, I don't know. I don't remember if I said that via text.
[36:20.090 --> 36:28.810]  But if crabbing was what Gavin described, if I knew nothing about it and I believed Gavin, I would show up with pillows duct-taped to my body and tongs in both hands.
[36:29.510 --> 36:32.510]  I would not be prepared to just walk in and grab.
[36:32.930 --> 36:33.170]  That's crazy.
[36:33.170 --> 36:34.410]  You just need gloves, I think.
[36:34.510 --> 36:36.890]  I think it's just... they don't gotta jump on your shins.
[36:36.890 --> 36:40.070]  No, I need range. I need tongs. I need tongs in both hands.
[36:40.250 --> 36:42.850]  I don't trust... I don't trust this.
[36:42.850 --> 36:47.970]  How big are the crabs in your imagination right now? Because mine are just like the size of a fist or something.
[36:48.330 --> 36:51.810]  Yeah, they're around that size too. I still just don't want to deal with that.
[36:52.290 --> 36:56.790]  I don't want to... I don't... Listen, I cut my foot the other day. I'm scared. I'm scared of sharp objects.
[36:57.410 --> 36:59.950]  Was that when you went outside to get your birthday presents?
[37:00.350 --> 37:02.010]  No, it wasn't. It was inside.
[37:02.310 --> 37:03.370]  How did you do it?
[37:03.650 --> 37:11.470]  I was going to bed. It was really late. It was dark. And I stepped on... there was just a piece of glass on my floor, I guess, that I didn't know was glass.
[37:11.470 --> 37:15.930]  It says moving stuff. And I stepped on it. And I was like, ah, I stepped on something. That's annoying.
[37:16.230 --> 37:20.770]  So I went to brush it off by rubbing it across the top of my other foot.
[37:20.970 --> 37:23.750]  And I just sliced across the top of my foot.
[37:24.170 --> 37:28.830]  And I was like, that didn't feel good. So then I just went to bed and was like, oh man, my foot's sore.
[37:28.890 --> 37:30.670]  I think I may have cut it or something. I don't know.
[37:30.910 --> 37:35.410]  And I woke up and I had blood in my sheets and this cut across the top of my foot.
[37:35.610 --> 37:37.810]  So I'm very nervous of sharp things right now, Gavin.
[37:38.150 --> 37:40.770]  I do not want to fuck with these crabs. I don't trust it.
[37:41.290 --> 37:43.350]  Don't run a crab across your skin, then.
[37:44.330 --> 37:46.910]  No, they won't. So I'll be covered in pillows with my tongs.
[37:47.490 --> 37:48.450]  They're not even near me.
[37:48.830 --> 37:53.250]  Also, we can bring those little rubber bands that you get on asparagus and celery and stuff.
[37:53.390 --> 37:56.110]  And then we can snap them around their little pinchers.
[37:56.410 --> 37:59.710]  I like that idea. Can we get rubber band guns and try to shoot it onto them?
[37:59.710 --> 38:09.670]  Yes. And what we should also do, and where I'm going with that, is once we've got them subdued to the point where they're not a danger to us or each other,
[38:09.670 --> 38:15.890]  then I think we determine who our favorite crab each is, and then we do a crab race.
[38:16.630 --> 38:16.950]  Okay.
[38:17.550 --> 38:22.870]  Like, we make a little track, and then we put them at one end, and then we get to the other end, and we try to encourage our crab, like,
[38:22.930 --> 38:26.230]  Come on, crabby! Come on, old blue! You know, come on, pinchy! Or whatever.
[38:26.310 --> 38:31.090]  And then we see who's the best crab racer. In addition to crabbing in general.
[38:31.410 --> 38:33.430]  There's so much crab-related stuff we can do.
[38:33.830 --> 38:35.450]  Are we releasing them afterwards, or are we going to have lunch?
[38:35.670 --> 38:38.710]  No, I don't think I could kill a crab. I think we'd have to release them.
[38:38.710 --> 38:44.070]  You can't kill a crab, but you could smash its claw shut and make it race.
[38:44.830 --> 38:47.250]  Well, that wasn't my idea. I didn't put that forward.
[38:47.250 --> 38:51.490]  Hey, that's calisthenics, dude. We're not hurting the crab by making it work out.
[38:51.650 --> 38:54.650]  And we're going to take the rubber bands off at the end.
[38:55.010 --> 38:55.370]  Okay.
[38:55.830 --> 38:59.250]  I'm not going to release a neutered crab back into the wild and not be able to defend itself.
[39:00.970 --> 39:03.510]  And we could release them back into the wild, free.
[39:04.750 --> 39:07.570]  Maybe one of them will have a tiny trophy it can take with it, but yeah.
[39:07.570 --> 39:10.910]  Oh, that'd be awesome. Just glue a little trophy to its head.
[39:12.590 --> 39:13.530]  That'd be terrible.
[39:14.370 --> 39:16.490]  I don't think we should glue things to crabs.
[39:18.410 --> 39:20.290]  I don't think we should do anything to crabs.
[39:21.990 --> 39:24.570]  I agree. I don't want to be anywhere near this pool.
[39:25.030 --> 39:25.910]  What do you mean?
[39:26.570 --> 39:31.330]  Do you think on this grand scheme of things, eating them is better than putting something on them?
[39:31.370 --> 39:32.870]  Like, at least in my scenario.
[39:32.870 --> 39:45.210]  I would say catching and quickly dispatching a crab for food is less humiliating and harmful than gluing a crown to its head and binding its claws.
[39:46.150 --> 39:48.030]  No, never. Never do that.
[39:48.510 --> 39:51.390]  Never bind the claws. I don't want to glue anything, but it's just, it's funny.
[39:51.570 --> 39:54.970]  You're just like, no, I want to do the more humane thing of killing it and eating it.
[39:55.050 --> 39:56.070]  That's what I would like to do.
[39:56.970 --> 39:57.950]  Well, I mean, it happens.
[39:58.530 --> 39:59.310]  It does happen.
[39:59.890 --> 40:00.050]  It happens every day.
[40:00.050 --> 40:00.450]  That's true.
[40:00.650 --> 40:01.250]  Every day.
[40:01.850 --> 40:04.870]  Chances are, chances are that crab's killed a few things in its life.
[40:04.870 --> 40:06.530]  Every ten seconds, a crab is killed.
[40:09.010 --> 40:10.310]  I don't even know how you kill a crab.
[40:11.230 --> 40:13.710]  I think you just stab it, from my understanding.
[40:14.150 --> 40:14.930]  They're pretty hard.
[40:15.290 --> 40:16.270]  That's like a lobster, right?
[40:16.650 --> 40:17.730]  Do you do the same thing with a crab?
[40:18.250 --> 40:23.670]  Fucking look at, Gavin is over here talking about crabs being invulnerable with claws, and he's like, I'm hopping in the pool.
[40:23.790 --> 40:25.450]  What are you saying? What are you talking about?
[40:25.670 --> 40:27.370]  Do you think you can break a crab's nose?
[40:27.370 --> 40:29.010]  The crab pool, in your analogy.
[40:29.490 --> 40:32.710]  You're like, I'm gonna hop into the crab pool and just grab crabs with my hands.
[40:32.830 --> 40:34.850]  And on the other side of it, I'm like, how do you kill them?
[40:34.850 --> 40:36.290]  And you're like, they're fucking invulnerable.
[40:36.610 --> 40:37.830]  And they have claws for hands.
[40:37.910 --> 40:38.950]  Like, what are you doing?
[40:40.570 --> 40:41.290]  That's reckless.
[40:43.710 --> 40:44.710]  I don't understand.
[40:45.230 --> 40:47.050]  I don't understand your logic at all.
[40:48.030 --> 40:52.710]  The crazy thing about this is these are all of our pre-crabbing opinions of how it's gonna go.
[40:52.710 --> 41:01.550]  Someday, we're gonna have a post-crabbing episode, and we'll find out how wrong we were about all of it.
[41:01.550 --> 41:02.650]  We couldn't be more wrong.
[41:02.750 --> 41:06.430]  I feel like the real version would be very boring of us standing on a pier.
[41:07.050 --> 41:13.590]  I don't think that anything we do will be boring, but I can't wait for our post-crabbing wrap-up.
[41:14.690 --> 41:19.030]  Think of all the crab-related knowledge that we'll have in our brains after this.
[41:19.030 --> 41:24.810]  And then, we can move on to the next thing, and before you know it, we will have done that 99% of all stuff in the universe.
[41:25.290 --> 41:27.210]  I don't know if I've ever even had crab legs.
[41:27.630 --> 41:32.830]  Like, I know I've had crab in, like, sushi, but I don't think I've ever had crab legs or a dish like that.
[41:32.890 --> 41:34.730]  Like, a crab-based thing that wasn't sushi.
[41:35.210 --> 41:42.070]  Would you rather, if we were to have a crab lunch of crab legs, not the crabs that we're gonna be catching, obviously,
[41:42.410 --> 41:46.130]  would you rather have that lunch before we go crabbing or after we go crabbing?
[41:46.790 --> 41:48.870]  What do you think would be psychologically better for you?
[41:49.290 --> 41:52.530]  Yeah, I think psychologically, probably before, to be like...
[41:52.530 --> 41:53.010]  I think so too.
[41:53.230 --> 41:59.090]  We owned you guys. We got this. We have the advantage. We're clearly in the power position.
[41:59.650 --> 42:00.750]  It's to psych yourself up.
[42:01.190 --> 42:05.710]  It'll make us feel like you're dead on. We'll be in the power position. It'll make us feel superior.
[42:06.210 --> 42:12.530]  I really, I would be afraid that, like, if my crab imprints on me, or I imprint on it, and we develop a connection,
[42:12.650 --> 42:16.310]  there'd be no way I could follow through with eating a different crab later in the same day.
[42:16.610 --> 42:18.450]  What if they could tell, and they were more pissed?
[42:19.590 --> 42:24.190]  That is also true. That's also fucked up. I didn't think about that. Yeah, I don't know.
[42:25.850 --> 42:28.850]  That changes everything. I didn't consider that as an angle.
[42:29.410 --> 42:30.430]  Well, we'll have to find out.
[42:30.790 --> 42:35.170]  I guess so. Maybe, yeah. I don't know, maybe one of us eats crabs beforehand, and the rest don't,
[42:35.210 --> 42:38.170]  and we just discuss how we feel about it? I don't know. I don't know how we measure that.
[42:38.550 --> 42:40.830]  I don't really like crab. Not a fan of it.
[42:41.130 --> 42:44.750]  Yeah, same. I think I've only eaten it once in my life. I don't remember anything about it.
[42:44.750 --> 42:50.070]  I feel like I've only had it on the top of a slightly fancy steak at a restaurant once.
[42:50.430 --> 42:54.010]  And it didn't really make the steak any better to me.
[42:54.410 --> 42:59.390]  You mentioned you're going to Vegas, Geoff. I had a realization last night.
[42:59.390 --> 43:01.590]  I'm gonna go buy video games for you this weekend.
[43:02.910 --> 43:06.750]  We can talk about that. I was actually nervous, because I texted you about that.
[43:07.290 --> 43:11.510]  I texted you last night about it, and you didn't reply at all, and I got very... I was nervous.
[43:11.510 --> 43:16.530]  I'll be honest with you. It was a whole long text about second-guessing and stuff.
[43:16.670 --> 43:20.250]  And I already bought the tickets. I've already booked the hotel. I already have a driver.
[43:20.890 --> 43:23.690]  We're too far along to pull the plug now.
[43:25.210 --> 43:30.630]  In a Vegas kind of aspect, you want to put your rookie bets down while you're there.
[43:30.830 --> 43:33.410]  I'm gonna put all of our rookie bets down. Well, I'll bet for Gavin.
[43:33.790 --> 43:39.410]  I have cracked my gambling code. I figured out how to win. I've come up with a system.
[43:39.410 --> 43:42.850]  And last night, I finally figured it out.
[43:43.430 --> 43:45.510]  I bet... let me organize these photos.
[43:45.610 --> 43:52.430]  So I bet on the Royals game, the Kansas City Royals, and the Baltimore Orioles.
[43:53.050 --> 43:56.770]  And they were going into the seventh inning, I want to say.
[43:57.410 --> 44:03.010]  And I bet that there would be less than 6.5 runs, I believe was the bet.
[44:03.350 --> 44:03.750]  Total?
[44:04.230 --> 44:05.250]  Total. Yeah.
[44:05.250 --> 44:10.350]  And what was the score in the seventh inning at that point when you placed the bet? 0-0?
[44:10.930 --> 44:14.550]  Yeah, so this is the score right now. Or this was the score going into the seventh.
[44:14.710 --> 44:16.830]  Kansas had four runs.
[44:18.250 --> 44:22.550]  They're going into the seventh inning. I bet that there wouldn't be more than 6.
[44:22.610 --> 44:24.190]  If they got 7, I would lose the bet.
[44:24.990 --> 44:28.650]  I'm feeling confident about it. I'm like, ah, they have a lead. It'll be kind of a slow game.
[44:29.150 --> 44:30.490]  Everything will be fine.
[44:30.490 --> 44:35.610]  Then we move into the seventh inning, and the Kansas City Royals score one more run.
[44:35.870 --> 44:38.770]  Here's what I'm noticing about the Kansas City Royals.
[44:39.170 --> 44:44.430]  They score every odd inning, and there's nine innings.
[44:44.570 --> 44:45.750]  So you have a ninth inning coming up.
[44:46.470 --> 44:51.770]  Yeah, so every second inning. So my bet is less than 7 runs.
[44:52.310 --> 44:54.750]  Is that what says 6.5? Can you get 0.5?
[44:55.110 --> 44:57.990]  No, you can't get 0.5. It's just to set the line.
[44:57.990 --> 45:00.530]  So if I get 6, I win. If it goes to 7, I lose.
[45:01.970 --> 45:03.450]  Under 7 would also work.
[45:03.910 --> 45:05.970]  Yes, under 7 would be fine.
[45:06.390 --> 45:10.170]  So just 6. Which is 6. That was a weird way of phrasing that.
[45:10.430 --> 45:12.730]  Less than 7. But no, well, yeah.
[45:13.050 --> 45:14.810]  Well, I'm saying, it doesn't matter.
[45:15.250 --> 45:15.750]  It doesn't matter.
[45:15.890 --> 45:18.070]  Why is it 6.5 if there's only 6 and 7?
[45:18.530 --> 45:20.930]  Because it can't be 6.5.
[45:21.110 --> 45:25.630]  So if it crosses to 7, if it is 7, then I would win with 7.
[45:26.190 --> 45:27.710]  Yeah, if it's 7, no one wins.
[45:28.130 --> 45:29.750]  Yeah, it's just setting a line.
[45:29.890 --> 45:32.010]  That it could be above or below. There has to be a 0.5.
[45:32.350 --> 45:35.410]  So they're going into the 8th inning.
[45:36.030 --> 45:38.710]  And Kansas now has 5 runs total.
[45:39.390 --> 45:40.430]  I'm getting nervous.
[45:41.350 --> 45:43.590]  So then they do nothing. Kansas gets nothing.
[45:44.110 --> 45:45.250]  Can you say Kansas City, please?
[45:45.850 --> 45:46.290]  Kansas City.
[45:46.730 --> 45:47.230]  Okay, thank you.
[45:47.690 --> 45:48.450]  What was that?
[45:48.870 --> 45:50.910]  You just keep saying Kansas. It's driving me crazy.
[45:51.070 --> 45:51.810]  It's Kansas City.
[45:52.210 --> 45:53.650]  Would it be better if I said Royals?
[45:54.330 --> 45:58.090]  That's fine, too. Kansas and Kansas City are different places.
[45:58.650 --> 46:01.990]  Okay. Royals. The Royals needed one more run.
[46:02.450 --> 46:05.710]  I was nervous. And then I stopped watching. I looked again.
[46:06.170 --> 46:08.470]  The Orioles had bases loaded, no outs.
[46:09.310 --> 46:10.890]  I was like, ah, fuck. This is gonna...
[46:10.890 --> 46:15.270]  As soon as I bet the under, everything shifted. The game shifted.
[46:15.610 --> 46:19.210]  So then I panicked bet, and I took the Orioles to just win.
[46:19.630 --> 46:21.290]  I just reversed my bet.
[46:21.290 --> 46:25.370]  Which would then mean that for that to happen, I would need to lose my other bet.
[46:25.850 --> 46:30.230]  But I am such a jinx. Whenever I bet on anything, I lose immediately.
[46:30.430 --> 46:34.530]  I bet on the Red Sox losing. Ten seconds later, they home run and win the game by two.
[46:34.910 --> 46:37.050]  It's just a ridiculous curse.
[46:37.370 --> 46:41.010]  I realized the success to me winning bets is I need to start fading myself.
[46:41.470 --> 46:44.550]  I will make one bet saying an obvious thing will happen,
[46:44.670 --> 46:48.650]  and then I will bet on the unlikely thing and hope that happens.
[46:48.650 --> 46:50.210]  So then we're in the eighth inning.
[46:50.710 --> 46:53.570]  And in the eighth inning, this is what happens.
[46:54.310 --> 46:56.250]  As soon as I counter my bet...
[46:56.250 --> 46:56.630]  Nine?!
[46:56.630 --> 47:00.930]  The Royals score nine runs in the eighth inning.
[47:01.790 --> 47:03.890]  What do you mean the Orioles do it?
[47:04.210 --> 47:04.490]  Yes, the Orioles.
[47:04.490 --> 47:06.230]  The Orioles score nine runs.
[47:06.530 --> 47:10.030]  So I bet that it would be under 6.5.
[47:10.350 --> 47:13.990]  Then they score nine. I panic once it was at six or whatever.
[47:13.990 --> 47:17.970]  I bet the Orioles to win to counter myself.
[47:17.970 --> 47:20.470]  I'm fading myself because once I bet one way,
[47:20.570 --> 47:24.010]  then it will absolutely go the opposite of whatever I said.
[47:24.370 --> 47:26.070]  So the trick is fading myself.
[47:26.070 --> 47:28.450]  I bet one way, bet the other way.
[47:28.750 --> 47:29.950]  Orioles score nine runs.
[47:30.330 --> 47:31.930]  And it was even a cartoonish thing.
[47:31.990 --> 47:33.090]  My bad luck is so bad.
[47:33.310 --> 47:36.950]  The runs came in because the Royals tripped each other in the outfield.
[47:37.190 --> 47:41.010]  That was going to be an easy catch in the back to end the inning.
[47:41.150 --> 47:43.710]  And instead, he tripped the guy.
[47:43.710 --> 47:45.990]  He sprinted over and took him out at the knees,
[47:46.090 --> 47:48.250]  which allowed nine runs to happen.
[47:48.950 --> 47:50.890]  So was there a grand slam involved?
[47:51.310 --> 47:53.190]  There were no grand slams,
[47:53.250 --> 47:56.670]  but it was like three runs scored in because he tripped his own guy.
[47:56.970 --> 47:59.530]  And then so the inning ended, they scored nine runs.
[47:59.610 --> 48:03.310]  They have a nine to what, five lead at that point.
[48:03.370 --> 48:04.250]  I'm like, this is great.
[48:04.310 --> 48:06.290]  We're going into the ninth inning, only one inning left.
[48:06.570 --> 48:10.070]  This is what the final score ended up being for the game.
[48:10.070 --> 48:14.030]  So it ended up being nine to eight for the Orioles.
[48:14.650 --> 48:18.190]  I was sweating when the Royals were coming back.
[48:18.310 --> 48:19.130]  They scored three runs.
[48:19.270 --> 48:21.150]  I was like, this is un-fucking-believable.
[48:21.590 --> 48:24.050]  I realized that my bad luck is like a pendulum.
[48:24.490 --> 48:26.490]  So I need to fade myself late,
[48:26.650 --> 48:29.110]  but not too late because it goes back and forth.
[48:29.250 --> 48:31.990]  Like once it realizes that I've made a counter bet,
[48:32.130 --> 48:34.610]  it then has to run back to fuck me over that way.
[48:35.010 --> 48:38.730]  So the key to my betting in the future is fading against myself,
[48:38.730 --> 48:42.150]  but late in the game so there isn't enough time for it to bite me in the ass.
[48:42.290 --> 48:47.190]  Or fade early enough that you can refade at the last minute.
[48:47.210 --> 48:48.090]  I can't triple fade.
[48:48.370 --> 48:49.190]  There's no triple fade?
[48:49.490 --> 48:51.230]  There's no triple fade. That's just losing.
[48:51.470 --> 48:52.390]  That'd be terrible.
[48:52.670 --> 48:56.090]  I think you could because if you could place...
[48:56.090 --> 48:58.090]  Because you're placing two bets versus one at that point,
[48:58.150 --> 48:58.950]  and two outweighs one.
[48:59.090 --> 49:01.430]  So it's just a matter of how much you...
[49:01.430 --> 49:02.470]  That's just a bet again.
[49:02.970 --> 49:04.750]  Yeah, that's true.
[49:04.890 --> 49:07.730]  I was texting Eric when it happened and when it was eight to nine
[49:07.730 --> 49:10.670]  with them still at bat, I was like, did I double fade myself?
[49:11.010 --> 49:11.650]  Holy shit.
[49:11.890 --> 49:12.430]  God damn, dude.
[49:12.810 --> 49:13.470]  I have terrible luck.
[49:13.650 --> 49:14.370]  But yeah, that's the key.
[49:14.770 --> 49:16.570]  I'm just going to bet against myself going forward.
[49:16.730 --> 49:18.770]  I've always said if somebody faded me, they'd do great.
[49:18.890 --> 49:19.710]  I'm going to be that person.
[49:19.810 --> 49:20.970]  I'm just going to start betting against me.
[49:21.130 --> 49:23.090]  Do you worry that you're affecting these games?
[49:23.530 --> 49:25.510]  I think the players would be pissed if that was the case.
[49:26.470 --> 49:27.430]  You think they're going to be pissed?
[49:27.530 --> 49:29.530]  Wait until the magic starts happening, dude.
[49:31.810 --> 49:33.090]  Yeah, this is pre-voodoo.
[49:36.010 --> 49:37.030]  That was my night.
[49:37.110 --> 49:37.670]  That was ridiculous.
[49:37.910 --> 49:41.270]  I've never seen nine runs scored in an inning before, especially that late
[49:41.270 --> 49:42.890]  when down five to zero.
[49:43.350 --> 49:44.170]  It was a great game.
[49:44.610 --> 49:46.190]  Man, the crowd must have been going apeshit.
[49:46.330 --> 49:47.130]  Nine in an inning.
[49:47.470 --> 49:49.150]  I feel like nobody was in the crowd.
[49:49.330 --> 49:50.790]  I feel like a lot of people had left.
[49:51.390 --> 49:53.050]  It seemed like a one-sided game.
[49:55.310 --> 49:55.610]  Oh, yeah.
[49:55.770 --> 49:58.510]  Well, yeah, they did nothing for seven innings.
[49:58.730 --> 50:00.690]  Yeah, it just seemed like it was locked up.
[50:00.850 --> 50:02.970]  And then they just scored nine in one inning.
[50:02.970 --> 50:08.090]  The adventure of fading against myself is going to be a fun journey going forward.
[50:08.150 --> 50:10.810]  Do you think some sort of pep talk happened after the seventh inning?
[50:10.970 --> 50:11.710]  Like, what happened there?
[50:12.630 --> 50:14.690]  It showed an image of Don Zimmer on the back.
[50:15.090 --> 50:15.910]  It rallied everybody.
[50:16.730 --> 50:22.770]  Is it Clash of the Titans or Jason and the Argonauts that has the gods
[50:22.770 --> 50:25.650]  kind of puppeteering what's happening to the mortals below?
[50:26.310 --> 50:30.670]  Do you think that's what was happening to the people in the stands in that game?
[50:30.670 --> 50:36.290]  They had no idea that Andrew, the betting baseball god, was affecting the outcome of their game.
[50:36.350 --> 50:38.410]  And they were just along for the ride.
[50:38.930 --> 50:39.590]  It has happened.
[50:40.030 --> 50:44.330]  I showed Eric a different bet before that involved the Padres.
[50:44.550 --> 50:45.770]  And I was like, how do you feel about this?
[50:45.790 --> 50:46.950]  He's like, oh, that's an easy bet.
[50:47.010 --> 50:47.650]  You should do that.
[50:48.090 --> 50:48.710]  And I did it.
[50:48.870 --> 50:50.050]  And then they died.
[50:50.150 --> 50:51.050]  They had a terrible game.
[50:51.470 --> 50:52.270]  I tanked them.
[50:52.330 --> 50:53.710]  I feel like I can tank teams.
[50:54.150 --> 50:56.170]  I feel like I'm like a long-distance cooler.
[50:56.470 --> 51:00.190]  You're making me a little nervous about this roulette idea we had for this weekend.
[51:00.190 --> 51:01.670]  I gotta be honest with you.
[51:01.890 --> 51:04.270]  Was it a roulette idea or a keno idea?
[51:04.730 --> 51:05.070]  Roulette.
[51:05.730 --> 51:11.210]  What an interesting... you're getting your picks in from a different country.
[51:11.950 --> 51:12.090]  Yeah.
[51:12.210 --> 51:12.430]  That's great.
[51:12.590 --> 51:13.770]  I didn't realize you wanted to do roulette.
[51:14.130 --> 51:15.970]  That's more of a live game than I was anticipating.
[51:15.990 --> 51:21.210]  Emily had this idea, Gavin, that while we're in Vegas this weekend, we should go to a roulette wheel,
[51:21.550 --> 51:26.810]  and we should have Andrew run his ball machine and pop a number out, and then we bet on that number.
[51:26.810 --> 51:30.470]  I feel like you kind of used up all your luck last week.
[51:30.950 --> 51:31.350]  Well...
[51:31.350 --> 51:32.330]  I don't know.
[51:32.630 --> 51:33.850]  It might be worth trying again.
[51:34.090 --> 51:35.270]  It'd be amazing if that hit.
[51:36.310 --> 51:40.010]  I love that nobody really commented on that in that episode that came out,
[51:40.070 --> 51:42.930]  and I think it's because people are scared that it was fake.
[51:43.270 --> 51:46.450]  Like, they don't want to celebrate it out of the fear that they'll be proved wrong.
[51:46.610 --> 51:50.170]  I think it's because more people just heard the shift thing and thought it was insane.
[51:50.710 --> 51:54.650]  They were so distracted by the goddamn shift thing, they never heard that part of the podcast, probably.
[51:55.490 --> 51:56.090]  It's just weird.
[51:56.090 --> 51:57.470]  It's a weird thing that happened.
[51:57.590 --> 51:58.870]  I hope it works for you.
[51:59.030 --> 52:03.450]  I'm terrible with roulette, though, as established, so you need to balance that out against the machine.
[52:03.850 --> 52:07.590]  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not anticipating winning, but we'll see.
[52:08.110 --> 52:09.010]  So what's this Vegas trip?
[52:10.070 --> 52:12.770]  Oh, Andrew wants me to buy some video games for him.
[52:13.230 --> 52:17.290]  That's not true, necessarily. I wouldn't...
[52:17.290 --> 52:18.090]  That's...
[52:19.050 --> 52:20.670]  That's technically what's happening.
[52:20.970 --> 52:24.330]  I found this place that's selling these video games I want. It's in Vegas.
[52:24.330 --> 52:27.470]  And I said, I'll go to Vegas. Do you want to go?
[52:27.730 --> 52:31.050]  And you were like, I can't go to Vegas right now because I'm in Canada, and it's a whole thing.
[52:31.230 --> 52:33.510]  And I said, well, I'll go for you. I'll go buy your video games for you.
[52:33.510 --> 52:35.670]  That's a different thing. That is a complete... you're right.
[52:35.870 --> 52:42.450]  I'm joking, but I am going. I was looking for an excuse to go, and this is an excuse, but I really do want to go to Vegas.
[52:43.050 --> 52:46.030]  I just needed one reason to go. You were my reason.
[52:46.490 --> 52:53.050]  That was just an important clarification, because I'd feel terrible if I was... and that was the sole motivator of going.
[52:53.050 --> 52:56.270]  I don't know. I just don't like the idea of persuading you to do that for that reason.
[52:56.470 --> 53:01.750]  I'm collecting some games right now. I decided I wanted to try to get some games that I really enjoyed growing up.
[53:01.890 --> 53:09.570]  Mainly on the 360, because there's not much collecting happening as far as sealed 360 games go at this point.
[53:10.090 --> 53:11.150]  And they have a bunch of them.
[53:11.490 --> 53:15.870]  And you told me something that blew my mind and might surprise you as well, Gavin.
[53:17.050 --> 53:20.370]  The Xbox 360 is going to be a classic console when?
[53:20.770 --> 53:24.910]  I think 2025, right? It's when something turns 20.
[53:25.130 --> 53:27.210]  So like four years from now?
[53:27.470 --> 53:33.110]  Yeah, it'll be retro. The 360 will be in the retro category, which is very weird to think of.
[53:33.250 --> 53:34.550]  So your cat is retro?
[53:35.050 --> 53:38.210]  My cat is retro. Yeah, I have a retro cat.
[53:41.390 --> 53:46.470]  But then Andrew, he started texting me all this stuff last night. He was like, listen, I'm starting to read about this place.
[53:46.490 --> 53:49.410]  It seems kind of sketchy. I don't want to send you into a bad environment.
[53:49.410 --> 53:53.410]  And I'm like, am I going to buy Xbox 360 games or am I buying this?
[53:54.810 --> 54:00.290]  So I saw a video and somebody was like, oh, I went game hunting in Vegas.
[54:00.450 --> 54:03.450]  This is what I found. I was like, oh, that's funny because of what we talked about.
[54:03.530 --> 54:07.590]  And I watched it and they went to the place and they had a really bad experience.
[54:08.130 --> 54:11.810]  And my anxiety was, I want you and Emily to have a fantastic trip.
[54:11.870 --> 54:13.470]  That's way more important to me than those games.
[54:13.470 --> 54:22.330]  So I just didn't want you to be in any form of uncomfortable or unpleasant experience because of me on your trip.
[54:22.670 --> 54:26.770]  That was purely an anxiety play. I just want you and Emily to have a fantastic time.
[54:27.270 --> 54:31.350]  I was playing. I'm going to have a fantastic time. I appreciate it. I've already booked some stuff.
[54:31.850 --> 54:37.090]  I was just going to go sometime Saturday in the afternoon, take a cab over there with the list, buy what you need,
[54:37.550 --> 54:42.090]  throw it in my hotel room and go back to go back about my my sports book betting business,
[54:42.910 --> 54:45.690]  which I'll probably spend most of the weekend in the sports book, honestly.
[54:46.290 --> 54:51.990]  So it'll be an hour and a half inconvenience. And if it goes wrong, it's content.
[54:52.210 --> 54:56.630]  And if it goes right, it's less content, but still. So I'm cool with it either way.
[54:57.070 --> 54:59.730]  It's a great week to go to Vegas. NFL season starts. Yeah.
[55:00.190 --> 55:04.230]  I made an absurd under bet, which there's no way it will hit, but it's fun.
[55:04.230 --> 55:11.630]  I took every game going under and I think it's ten dollars and it cashes out at like one hundred and sixty thousand dollars if it wins.
[55:12.950 --> 55:16.270]  What are you going to do with all that money? Yeah, a lot of 360 games.
[55:16.750 --> 55:20.610]  It does nothing. There's no way it hits. I do like about the under though.
[55:20.710 --> 55:24.290]  I start every game a winner. I start every game in a winning position.
[55:27.410 --> 55:32.490]  That's true. It's true. I got to go rescue Puss Puss for Henry. He's going to growl.
[55:32.490 --> 55:34.610]  Just say it. Wait, what is it?
[55:34.710 --> 55:39.130]  Puss Puss is a toy? There's Owl Owl. Have we heard of Puss Puss on the show before?
[55:39.510 --> 55:43.710]  I'm not sure I've heard of Puss Puss yet. I don't. Is that a new toy that in the rotation?
[55:44.510 --> 55:48.750]  All right. Crisis averted. Is Puss Puss a new toy, Geoff? Puss Puss is the octopus.
[55:49.010 --> 55:52.990]  It's been there before. We've talked about it. OK. Yeah, I'm familiar with the octopus. That is not a new toy.
[55:53.030 --> 55:56.470]  No, Puss Puss isn't new. That's interesting. I like the naming scheme of the toys.
[55:56.850 --> 56:00.270]  I don't name them. They're just the names that are given to me by Emily.
[56:00.270 --> 56:04.350]  She's the clever namer. What are the other toys named?
[56:04.830 --> 56:08.890]  Oh, everything twice. There's Puss Puss, there's Owl Owl.
[56:10.210 --> 56:13.490]  There's, I don't know, Bone Bone Dog Dog.
[56:14.010 --> 56:17.630]  I made that shit up, but it's like whatever, whatever you see, just say it twice.
[56:17.690 --> 56:20.710]  And that's what it is. But there's a different rule for Puss Puss because it's an octopus.
[56:20.950 --> 56:24.350]  So it's only the back half. It's not octopus octopus. Yeah.
[56:24.510 --> 56:29.650]  And we typically call it Owl Owl instead of Owl Owl because it sounds like it's getting hurt when he squeezes it.
[56:30.230 --> 56:35.390]  OK, so it's like a one syllable. If the name goes beyond two, you're only using the back syllable.
[56:35.870 --> 56:40.450]  I'm sure there's others. I just can't think of them right now. So Gavin is VinVin in this name scheme.
[56:43.570 --> 56:49.830]  VinVin. Gavin is, uh, Gavin is Gavver and will forever be Gavver.
[56:49.910 --> 56:52.950]  Because that's what my daughter called him when she was like two or three.
[56:54.130 --> 56:56.290]  For the rest of my life, he'll be Gavver in my head.
[56:56.290 --> 57:00.230]  I'd rather be Gavver than VinVin. VinVin is not a good nickname.
[57:00.550 --> 57:02.510]  Oh my God, you're almost going to be spit up.
[57:04.110 --> 57:07.670]  That was a little school school time nickname for a while was Vinny.
[57:08.270 --> 57:10.710]  Really? Wait, you were Vinny?
[57:11.270 --> 57:12.890]  I was Vinny for like... Nothing!
[57:13.650 --> 57:18.290]  Vinny, Vinny. There's no way that's true. Nobody looks at you and says you're Vinny.
[57:18.570 --> 57:19.690]  That didn't happen.
[57:19.690 --> 57:21.690]  Well, it was...
[57:24.210 --> 57:26.010]  Guess what's about to stick?
[57:27.010 --> 57:27.450]  Vinny!
[57:27.790 --> 57:31.170]  Yeah, imagine the opposite of Vinny Jones. And then there's me.
[57:32.090 --> 57:36.870]  I got just called Vinny and Vincent for like a year by this one... just people in one class.
[57:37.430 --> 57:39.070]  And then it sort of went away. I just left.
[57:39.530 --> 57:42.010]  Indulge me for a second. I'd like to try something out if you guys don't mind.
[57:42.070 --> 57:42.330]  Okay.
[57:43.750 --> 57:47.470]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[57:48.570 --> 57:51.170]  Thanks for coming. My name, as always, is Geoff Ramsey.
[57:51.310 --> 57:55.150]  And with me, as always, Andrew Panton and Vinny Vincent Free.
[57:55.650 --> 57:57.970]  And we are here to entertain you this week.
[57:58.230 --> 57:59.230]  I like the sound of that.
[57:59.530 --> 57:59.730]  Yeah?
[58:00.030 --> 58:02.090]  Or should I just say, Geoff... How about this?
[58:02.250 --> 58:04.290]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[58:05.090 --> 58:07.650]  Hosted by myself, Geoff and Gavin... Sorry.
[58:08.030 --> 58:10.710]  Hosted by Geoff, Andrew and Vinny.
[58:11.410 --> 58:14.350]  I think you gotta put some flavor on it.
[58:14.410 --> 58:16.130]  I think you gotta go, welcome to the F*** Face Podcast.
[58:16.130 --> 58:18.850]  I'm your host, Geoff Ramsey, along with my co-host, Andrew Panton.
[58:18.930 --> 58:21.470]  And oh, motherf***ing Vinny Free!
[58:22.570 --> 58:22.850]  I like that.
[58:22.850 --> 58:25.550]  And then I think people really get excited.
[58:26.190 --> 58:27.930]  Bring a little bit of, like, the flavor to it.
[58:28.090 --> 58:28.410]  Yeah.
[58:28.850 --> 58:30.470]  People called you Vincent-y?
[58:31.190 --> 58:31.430]  Yeah.
[58:32.070 --> 58:33.970]  That doesn't even... That doesn't track at all.
[58:35.790 --> 58:37.450]  Yeah, Michael told me his middle name once.
[58:37.590 --> 58:39.210]  I was like, oh, that was my nickname at school.
[58:39.930 --> 58:41.390]  What a shitty nickname!
[58:42.170 --> 58:44.330]  That's coming from somebody who had ANSAC!
[58:44.510 --> 58:45.810]  I'm making fun of yours!
[58:47.650 --> 58:49.590]  You didn't come up with your own nickname, dude!
[58:49.890 --> 58:52.530]  No, I'm just saying it's a bad draw. I'm not blaming you for it.
[58:52.550 --> 58:53.430]  It's more of an observation.
[58:53.890 --> 58:55.930]  You got a bad draw on Vincent and Vinny.
[58:56.590 --> 58:59.250]  Oh, I don't think it's a bad... Vincent Price? That's a cool dude.
[58:59.630 --> 59:01.470]  It's a very cool dude. Doesn't fit you at all.
[59:01.570 --> 59:03.150]  I don't see you as a Vincent or a Vinny.
[59:03.830 --> 59:07.190]  I like this nickname thing. What other nicknames did y'all have growing up?
[59:07.870 --> 59:08.230]  Navigator.
[59:09.270 --> 59:09.630]  Navigator.
[59:10.550 --> 59:13.110]  Same guy that called me Vinny called me the Navigator.
[59:14.130 --> 59:18.030]  I love that this guy was like, I'm gonna get one that sticks. I'm just workshopping.
[59:18.530 --> 59:19.450]  Vinny didn't work.
[59:20.190 --> 59:22.210]  But they actually stuck for quite a long time.
[59:22.550 --> 59:24.670]  He used to call me GavNav, and then it just became Nav.
[59:26.070 --> 59:27.750]  GavNav! GavNav is really good!
[59:28.430 --> 59:32.070]  So, Vinny, Vincent, GavNav, and ANSAC.
[59:32.350 --> 59:34.670]  Oh my god, it's like being in German class again.
[59:34.870 --> 59:37.630]  Vinny, Vincent, GavNav, and ANSAC.
[59:38.610 --> 59:41.510]  Did Eric or Nick have any nicknames growing up?
[59:41.910 --> 59:46.250]  No, nothing. Like, my name doesn't really lend itself to anything like that, but I also did...
[59:46.250 --> 59:49.430]  To be fair, I didn't think Gavin's did either, but here we are.
[59:50.290 --> 59:51.670]  Nick said it's fucking...
[59:52.450 --> 59:54.250]  He sounds like one of those dog toys.
[59:55.410 --> 59:56.390]  You know GavNav?
[59:58.830 --> 01:00:00.670]  Can we make GavNav dog toys?
[01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.490]  Oh, that's great.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.550]  Nicknames.
[01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.650]  So did you not have anything good? Either of you.
[01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:14.430]  To me? Andrew had ANSAC.
[01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:19.470]  Yeah, I didn't have the fucking naming genius in my school with me.
[01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:24.910]  I didn't have the fucking akinator or whatever just summoning names, throwing things out there.
[01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:26.370]  Seeing what will stick.
[01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:29.510]  When I was younger, they called me Jethro.
[01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.790]  Like Jethro, but Jethro.
[01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:43.690]  And when I moved to Austin at the tech company where we started the day job, they called me GFunk, which I hated.
[01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:47.390]  It's your username on the website.
[01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.710]  I know, I hate it.
[01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.470]  I don't know why I ever didn't hate it, but I definitely hate it now.
[01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:58.650]  Then you got Raymond Somer.
[01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.710]  Your birth name.
[01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:05.890]  Yeah, well, I guess I would say I guess the shittiest nickname I had is Andrew Panton.
[01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.810]  Both names.
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:07.770]  Sure.
[01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:09.010]  Yeah.
[01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:10.650]  Thanks for listening.
[01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:14.130]  Thanks for listening to another episode of We Already Done.
[01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:19.810]  Starring Geoff Ramsey, Andrew Panton, and Vinny Vincent Nabdab.
[01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:26.950]  We still didn't talk about superheroes.
[01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:32.950]  Remind me next week to tell you guys my fart story.
[01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:36.470]  We might as well just ask you every week.
[01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.270]  Yeah, this one's not me. This is Emily, though.
[01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.450]  Oh, I'm sorry to my fart story. We're out of time.
[01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.570]  Out of time next week. We'll push you to the next show.
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.870]  You gotta leave them on a cliffhanger.
[01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:48.550]  We do.
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:53.830]  They're gonna be like, I gotta know the fart story. I can't believe I have to wait another week to hear another fart story.
[01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:59.030]  Last week, I crammed research for the superhero topic.
[01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:03.310]  I felt like it made me go back to a child. I realized nothing has changed.
[01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:07.270]  We had a three-week break. I didn't do any of the prep for it until the night before.
[01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:12.090]  Yeah, I didn't do my homework until the night before, and I'm nervously trying to get everything done,
[01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:15.610]  and we haven't talked about it in three weeks or whatever since we came back.
[01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:20.250]  The best part about that is that my plan is to copy off your work.
[01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.730]  That is exactly like I said last week.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.020]  Alright, I'll see you guys next week.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:29.800]  Bye-bye.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.660]  Bye now.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:37.360]  Oh, shit. Don't forget to rate and like and stuff. Fucking stars. Everywhere stars. Don't forget the stars.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.540]  Nick, you gotta leave in the pause there.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.360]  That was a real-time pause.
