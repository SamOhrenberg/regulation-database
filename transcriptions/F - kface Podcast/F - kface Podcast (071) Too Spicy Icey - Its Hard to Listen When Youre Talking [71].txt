[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  Chicken in Dijon sauce.

[00:22.140 --> 00:40.440]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast
[00:41.440 --> 00:44.540]  Starring Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Frey, and Andrew Panton
[00:44.540 --> 00:47.800]  in no particular order in the comedy triangle.
[00:49.020 --> 00:52.280]  I was going to say, start us off, if there's one thing,
[00:52.380 --> 00:55.720]  two things that I've noticed that the audience is polarized about
[00:56.620 --> 00:59.060]  and by polarized, I mean that a percentage of them
[00:59.060 --> 01:00.380]  f***ing hate when we do it.
[01:00.780 --> 01:03.200]  It's a lot of people don't like when we talk about sports too much
[01:03.200 --> 01:06.480]  and a lot of people don't like when we talk about Survivor too much.
[01:06.740 --> 01:09.600]  So before we go into Survivor talk, maybe we should keep it brief.
[01:09.600 --> 01:10.740]  Yeah, no, I agree with that.
[01:10.960 --> 01:12.540]  Did you see there was a...
[01:12.540 --> 01:15.940]  I thought you were going to say, before we go into Survivor talk, let's get into some sports.
[01:17.860 --> 01:19.440]  I have both things on my notes.
[01:19.900 --> 01:23.840]  Talking about both things is a substantial update, also can't be brief.
[01:24.260 --> 01:28.180]  I enjoy that there is a subreddit thread about I was really,
[01:28.280 --> 01:29.800]  it was the most conflicted.
[01:30.120 --> 01:32.460]  It was like, I really like when they talk about sports.
[01:32.540 --> 01:34.060]  They should talk about sports more.
[01:34.340 --> 01:38.700]  And then all the comments were people debating whether they like the sports talk or not.
[01:38.700 --> 01:44.520]  So somebody who really liked it, people upvoting it for either visibility or they agreed with it.
[01:44.560 --> 01:50.760]  And then all the comments of people being either not enjoying it or debating the value of it.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.280]  I will say when it comes to sports stuff, I find that we are mostly only drawn to silly fun.
[01:57.280 --> 01:57.920]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:58.120 --> 02:02.880]  I'm never just going to talk about the box score of a game and how some season is going.
[02:03.260 --> 02:05.520]  It's the weird angles of it.
[02:05.560 --> 02:08.320]  Like you said, the things that make me laugh are the things I enjoy.
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.500]  So speaking of the silly angles of it, if we're going to talk about Survivor,
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.700]  Gavin, maybe we should talk about the events leading up to Survivor and then the hiccup in Survivor.
[02:18.700 --> 02:20.660]  Well, that's more interesting than Survivor.
[02:20.980 --> 02:25.840]  Because talking about actual Survivor is boring for anyone who's not seen it.
[02:25.940 --> 02:26.060]  Yeah.
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.360]  But you offered to have a little Survivor watch party at your house.
[02:30.560 --> 02:30.760]  Yeah.
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.060]  And so you and Meg were like, dude, absolutely, we'll come over.
[02:34.260 --> 02:37.000]  And I was excited, very, very excited.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.320]  I don't think we've had anybody over to the house in months.
[02:40.980 --> 02:47.080]  And so we set to Survivors at 7, you guys were going to pick up some pizza on the way over.
[02:48.800 --> 02:57.320]  And I, at 4 o'clock, I left my house to go run some errands and I walked back in my house at 5 o'clock and something felt different.
[02:57.460 --> 03:01.420]  You know, like when you walk into a room and something's changed, but you don't know what it is immediately.
[03:01.780 --> 03:04.940]  It took me from the front of my house until my bedroom.
[03:05.120 --> 03:05.720]  Like in the Matrix.
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.700]  That I, until I realized, oh, the power's out.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.920]  The thing that's different is it's a little dark and I can't hear the air conditioning humming.
[03:15.340 --> 03:16.500]  And I go, what the fuck?
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.380]  And then Emily walks in the room, she goes, power's out.
[03:19.740 --> 03:21.940]  And I go, oh, what?
[03:22.220 --> 03:26.740]  And so I go to my phone to look up like the city of Austin outage map.
[03:27.020 --> 03:31.920]  And I have a text from the city of Austin that says, hey, your power's out, just FYI.
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.640]  Don't worry, we have a crew dispatched to fix it.
[03:35.740 --> 03:39.600]  The estimated repair time is 7.03 p.m.
[03:40.160 --> 03:42.320]  Survivor comes on at 7 p.m.
[03:42.880 --> 03:47.980]  So I text Gavin and Meg and I'm like, I can't believe that this is a thing.
[03:48.320 --> 03:53.180]  But I, of all, like, I know we just made plans two hours ago to hang out.
[03:53.580 --> 03:57.020]  But somehow in the last two hours my power went out.
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.420]  And by the way, the only place in Austin that the power's out.
[04:00.420 --> 04:01.680]  I made a video of it.
[04:02.140 --> 04:03.360]  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[04:03.880 --> 04:09.800]  Usually when you look at the outage map, it's like, number of customers affected, 7,000.
[04:09.920 --> 04:12.300]  Because usually like a big chunk of the grid has gone out.
[04:12.420 --> 04:15.840]  It was like, number of customers affected, 16.
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.760]  I took the video, I mean, obviously I can't show the video because it shows some identifying information.
[04:22.060 --> 04:26.520]  But I made a little video of them where it zooms out and you can see all of Austin has power.
[04:27.900 --> 04:31.620]  You continue and continue to zoom in until you get to my little neighborhood.
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.260]  So then Gav was like, well I guess we'll fucking come over to our house.
[04:37.660 --> 04:40.580]  And Meg is like, yeah, you guys pick up the pizza now.
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.000]  And so I'm like, ugh, fuck, that's, okay, yeah, I feel bad, but yeah, okay.
[04:45.340 --> 04:50.800]  So as I'm, and she was like, I'll tell you what, we'll check in in like 30 minutes and we'll see if your power's still out.
[04:50.800 --> 04:57.140]  And she texts me at like 6 and is like, hey, we're supposed to pick up the pizza in like 15 minutes or something.
[04:57.960 --> 04:59.540]  Should we switch it over to your name?
[04:59.720 --> 05:05.040]  And I'm typing, yeah, I looked outside, there's no repair crew in sight.
[05:05.520 --> 05:08.340]  There's no way in hell the power's coming back on.
[05:08.540 --> 05:14.880]  And as I was typing that, the power kicked on, all the lights turned on and I just deleted that and said, we're good, come on over.
[05:17.360 --> 05:24.700]  And then we're, we make it all the way through Survivor and we get to the fucking tribal council.
[05:25.560 --> 05:26.240]  Oh no.
[05:26.900 --> 05:30.040]  And we're watching live on Hulu Live, right, that's what I have.
[05:31.100 --> 05:34.260]  And it just turns off. It just goes, yeah, we can't play this right now.
[05:34.420 --> 05:37.600]  Yeah, power was still on, but Hulu was just like, eh, we're having problems.
[05:37.780 --> 05:39.060]  Yeah, Hulu was like, nah, we're good.
[05:39.280 --> 05:39.860]  Oh, weird.
[05:39.940 --> 05:43.720]  And I was like, what? And I go to grab the controller and it clicks back on.
[05:44.240 --> 05:45.100]  And we're fine.
[05:45.500 --> 05:45.760]  Oh.
[05:46.100 --> 05:46.900]  And then it does it again.
[05:47.460 --> 05:48.360]  And then we're fine.
[05:48.520 --> 05:49.500]  And then it does it again.
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.160]  And then we're fine.
[05:50.340 --> 05:51.940]  And then it does it for a while.
[05:52.160 --> 05:54.520]  And Gavin and Meg are looking at me like, I fucking hate you.
[05:54.840 --> 06:00.860]  We could have been watching this at home in our jammies, comfy in our house with our 200 cats.
[06:01.320 --> 06:04.700]  Instead, we drive all the way across town to your fucking ghetto.
[06:05.720 --> 06:08.340]  And now we're infected with all of your house problems.
[06:08.460 --> 06:09.600]  First, your power doesn't work.
[06:09.780 --> 06:11.940]  Now your goddamn TV won't play your goddamn show.
[06:11.940 --> 06:13.280]  And then I'm like, ah.
[06:13.380 --> 06:15.000]  So I switch over to the Hulu on the Xbox.
[06:15.800 --> 06:17.240]  And that didn't work either.
[06:17.580 --> 06:18.300]  So then I'm like, ah.
[06:18.360 --> 06:23.100]  And as I'm like about to throw in the towel and fucking just like crawl into a hole, it kicked back on.
[06:23.320 --> 06:24.380]  It had recorded it.
[06:24.420 --> 06:25.640]  We were able to finish watching it.
[06:26.300 --> 06:28.740]  We missed like 90% of that Tribal.
[06:28.920 --> 06:30.840]  Yeah, we missed a lot of the Tribal Council.
[06:31.340 --> 06:32.540]  Luckily, there were two in the episode.
[06:32.700 --> 06:34.480]  Yeah, we missed the second one.
[06:34.700 --> 06:35.160]  Most of it.
[06:35.540 --> 06:41.460]  I also like that I watch, I mean, 99% of stuff I watch is on demand, VOD, never live.
[06:41.460 --> 06:47.120]  The last thing I watched live using live television was the Euro finals.
[06:47.900 --> 06:51.560]  And the time before that, I think, yeah, I remember it too.
[06:51.660 --> 06:51.840]  Weird.
[06:52.080 --> 06:57.200]  The time before that, I think I was watching the 2018 World Cup final or something on live TV.
[06:57.380 --> 07:00.120]  So I watch live TV maybe once or twice a year.
[07:00.480 --> 07:03.800]  And this time it was just failing miserably.
[07:03.980 --> 07:04.940]  What a turd.
[07:05.280 --> 07:06.480]  But we got, we got through it.
[07:07.680 --> 07:12.800]  Like, how hard is it to have a, are you not blown away that it can't, it's Survivor.
[07:13.080 --> 07:13.840]  Everyone's watching it.
[07:13.880 --> 07:13.980]  I know.
[07:13.980 --> 07:14.680]  Is that why it goes down?
[07:14.820 --> 07:15.920]  I don't know, man.
[07:16.080 --> 07:18.380]  Have you ever had issues with Hulu Live?
[07:18.860 --> 07:19.580]  Going into this?
[07:19.660 --> 07:21.500]  No, not like that, no.
[07:21.840 --> 07:22.040]  Great.
[07:22.120 --> 07:23.200]  Very, very, very rarely.
[07:23.620 --> 07:24.720]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[07:25.380 --> 07:27.540]  Have you ever had a watch party with Hulu Live?
[07:27.620 --> 07:27.960]  No.
[07:28.180 --> 07:28.640]  There we go.
[07:28.660 --> 07:29.520]  I don't think I, yeah.
[07:29.600 --> 07:30.580]  This is the weather thing.
[07:30.700 --> 07:33.300]  It's the weather equivalent of your experience.
[07:33.300 --> 07:36.040]  As soon as you and Gavin organize a thing.
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.040]  Oh my God.
[07:37.040 --> 07:39.720]  It can't rain in the house, but it can just disconnect.
[07:39.960 --> 07:40.460]  That's what happens.
[07:41.320 --> 07:41.720]  Yeah.
[07:41.740 --> 07:45.700]  When we make an indoor plan, the power and the internet goes up.
[07:45.880 --> 07:50.000]  The plans were, it was, you know, I just realized we could, we could go back a couple steps.
[07:50.160 --> 07:57.040]  The whole story is even a little bit funnier because like a month ago, Emily made a reservation for dinner for four.
[07:57.040 --> 08:03.920]  And then she was like, we'll just invite Gavin and Meg, or if they're not available, somebody else closer to the event and see if anybody wants to go to dinner with us.
[08:03.960 --> 08:04.880]  And I was like, that's a great idea.
[08:05.160 --> 08:07.040]  And so about a week ago, I texted Gavin.
[08:07.080 --> 08:09.220]  I was like, hey, do y'all want to go get dinner Wednesday night?
[08:09.780 --> 08:10.880]  And Gavin's like, absolutely.
[08:11.240 --> 08:12.960]  So we all get ready to do it.
[08:13.060 --> 08:21.840]  And then yesterday, two days ago, Gavin texts me and goes, you realize we're going to dinner during the Survivor airing.
[08:21.840 --> 08:24.300]  And I was like, ah, Christ, really?
[08:24.300 --> 08:28.080]  And then so, but it was like late at night and I, Emily wasn't home from work yet.
[08:28.100 --> 08:30.300]  And I was like, well, I don't know, dude, I get, I don't know what we're doing.
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.460]  So I had to wait for Emily to get home and we talk it out.
[08:32.520 --> 08:35.800]  And then so we canceled the dinner plans yesterday morning.
[08:35.800 --> 08:40.400]  So the, and then pivoted to Survivor plans also that the power could go out.
[08:40.940 --> 08:41.260]  Perfect.
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.160]  Was it a place that you had to wait on a reservation for?
[08:45.360 --> 08:46.360]  Could you just rebook?
[08:46.920 --> 08:47.480]  How big of a loss was this?
[08:47.480 --> 08:47.940]  No, we could rebook.
[08:48.140 --> 08:49.140]  It wasn't, that wasn't a big loss.
[08:49.160 --> 08:49.860]  It wasn't a huge deal.
[08:50.100 --> 08:50.300]  Okay.
[08:50.580 --> 08:51.640]  No, it wasn't a huge deal at all.
[08:51.820 --> 08:53.260]  So same time next week?
[08:53.260 --> 08:53.760]  Yeah.
[08:53.800 --> 08:54.600]  Your house this time.
[08:55.420 --> 08:55.980]  All right.
[08:56.260 --> 08:57.080]  We'll see how it goes in life.
[08:57.100 --> 08:57.880]  We could go tradesies.
[08:58.080 --> 08:58.220]  Yeah.
[08:59.100 --> 08:59.860]  This is great.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.320]  It's like a second layer to the game for me.
[09:02.380 --> 09:04.640]  Just hearing how it failed for the two of you.
[09:04.700 --> 09:08.700]  So you had an internet, it wasn't even internet outage, it was an app outage.
[09:09.220 --> 09:10.760]  And the power went out.
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.660]  I think we should be very afraid of what will happen when we all have...
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.560]  I will just have both my ankles rolled, but that's every day.
[09:22.300 --> 09:24.180]  I'll show up in a full body cast.
[09:24.420 --> 09:25.540]  Have you ever had a double ankle roll?
[09:25.820 --> 09:27.500]  I've never had a double ankle roll.
[09:27.700 --> 09:28.060]  No.
[09:28.440 --> 09:30.580]  It doesn't mean, it doesn't need to happen at the same time, but...
[09:30.580 --> 09:31.000]  Oh!
[09:31.340 --> 09:34.180]  You staggered it so that the other one's still sore, and then you rolled the next one.
[09:34.180 --> 09:34.480]  Yeah, I have.
[09:34.480 --> 09:36.040]  Be like James Caan in Misery.
[09:36.320 --> 09:37.100]  I absolutely have.
[09:37.400 --> 09:41.520]  I've had things where I've hurt one ankle, and then had the hobble on the other ankle,
[09:41.680 --> 09:42.980]  and then hurt the other one.
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.420]  So by the time the first one healed, the second one was still in pain.
[09:47.740 --> 09:49.040]  Yeah, I've done the flip.
[09:49.080 --> 09:49.740]  I've ankle flipped.
[09:49.740 --> 09:54.660]  I dated a girl briefly in the army, who like three days after we started dating,
[09:55.180 --> 10:00.060]  she slipped and broke her leg, and had to be in a full leg cast, and wear crutches,
[10:00.440 --> 10:05.760]  and then she was in her room getting ready, and fucking fell off the crutches,
[10:06.040 --> 10:08.980]  and broke her arm, and had to have a full arm cast.
[10:09.220 --> 10:13.480]  So she had a full arm cast on one side of her body, and a full leg cast on the other,
[10:13.600 --> 10:15.760]  and then she dumped me.
[10:18.880 --> 10:20.320]  Were you unsupportive of her?
[10:20.320 --> 10:22.080]  As far as I know, she's still in those casts.
[10:22.600 --> 10:24.260]  No, I think it was really nice.
[10:24.440 --> 10:26.280]  I guess she had other stuff on her mind.
[10:27.300 --> 10:29.120]  I'd also like to point out your phrasing.
[10:29.260 --> 10:32.360]  You said she was wearing crutches, like they're a clothing accessory.
[10:32.380 --> 10:33.320]  Oh, I don't know, like using them, whatever.
[10:33.820 --> 10:34.460]  Did I say wearing?
[10:34.620 --> 10:36.160]  Like you pop on a pair of gloves.
[10:38.560 --> 10:40.200]  I've been losing it with that stuff lately.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.680]  The other day somebody honked, and we were in the car,
[10:42.680 --> 10:45.280]  and I screamed, I yelled, don't bark at me!
[10:45.580 --> 10:48.000]  And Emily was like, what the fuck did you just say?
[10:48.100 --> 10:50.420]  And I was like, don't honk at me.
[10:50.460 --> 10:51.420]  And she was like, no you did not.
[10:51.520 --> 10:52.600]  And I was like, oh man.
[10:52.940 --> 10:55.000]  And yeah, I don't know why I did that.
[10:56.380 --> 10:58.220]  Maybe early dementia, maybe.
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.500]  You did it in a f*** face recently.
[11:00.660 --> 11:02.540]  You said, you were like halfway through saying something,
[11:02.620 --> 11:05.740]  and then Andrew said a word, and then you ended your sentence with that word.
[11:05.880 --> 11:06.920]  And no one noticed.
[11:07.840 --> 11:10.000]  I'll pull up the clip for next time, because it made me laugh.
[11:10.080 --> 11:11.520]  I was like, did you mean to say that?
[11:12.360 --> 11:13.780]  It's from like two episodes ago.
[11:13.860 --> 11:14.980]  I didn't notice that either.
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.400]  I'd love to hear it.
[11:16.700 --> 11:19.560]  Hey, so what is new with you guys, by the way?
[11:20.100 --> 11:22.960]  Can we talk, speaking of things that nobody wants to hear,
[11:23.060 --> 11:26.020]  quickly cover the fact that there is magic in the air.
[11:26.080 --> 11:28.460]  We got some magic going, I'm feeling good about it.
[11:28.500 --> 11:31.240]  I don't think Gavin necessarily even knows about this.
[11:31.720 --> 11:33.320]  The magic has begun.
[11:33.880 --> 11:35.740]  Wow, I almost called you a different f***ing name.
[11:35.980 --> 11:36.500]  I'm sorry.
[11:36.700 --> 11:37.800]  I thought you were going to call me Brick.
[11:37.920 --> 11:38.800]  Yeah, I was going to call you Brick.
[11:38.840 --> 11:40.280]  Well, you got a million f***ing nicknames,
[11:40.280 --> 11:43.760]  so it's not out of the question that I could just throw a wrong name out there,
[11:43.840 --> 11:45.600]  and you were once called that as a child.
[11:46.040 --> 11:46.280]  Brick.
[11:47.560 --> 11:48.600]  Gavin and Brick.
[11:48.940 --> 11:49.660]  It's a great duo.
[11:53.280 --> 11:55.400]  Do you know somebody named Brick?
[11:55.440 --> 11:56.740]  I don't know anyone named Brick.
[11:57.100 --> 12:00.000]  That's the Borderlands guy's Brick, right?
[12:00.220 --> 12:01.660]  The big guy?
[12:02.020 --> 12:03.480]  The soldier class?
[12:04.380 --> 12:05.380]  Yeah, he's Brick.
[12:05.520 --> 12:06.120]  Steve Carell?
[12:06.460 --> 12:06.880]  Who is he?
[12:07.220 --> 12:08.120]  In Iron Command?
[12:08.720 --> 12:09.720]  Yeah, he's Brick Tannen.
[12:09.720 --> 12:15.420]  In the same way the Chevy Chevy Chase thing, I f***ed up Steve Carell's name for years.
[12:16.320 --> 12:17.200]  For years.
[12:17.600 --> 12:18.900]  Were you calling him Steve Carrell?
[12:19.060 --> 12:22.880]  Yeah, sure was. Years. Steve Carell. Every time I'd say it.
[12:22.900 --> 12:25.100]  But you got the Steve part right.
[12:25.260 --> 12:30.300]  I got the Steve right, yeah. I've never called him Brick Carell, which would be a fantastic combination.
[12:30.760 --> 12:32.020]  Or Stevey Carell.
[12:32.020 --> 12:41.060]  Yes, but the magic Andy Dalton ankle injury? Knee bruise? Something happened. He heard his leg. He's out.
[12:41.420 --> 12:44.400]  Justin Fields is in. Justin Fields is starting.
[12:45.120 --> 12:47.220]  It's a big news. I needed that.
[12:47.440 --> 12:54.460]  I would say that in the three-way race for Rookie of the Year, I am in last place right now.
[12:54.820 --> 12:59.120]  Najee Harris is doing okay, but Gavin, your quarterback, Mac Jones, is doing very well.
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.680]  And Andrew, it looks like Justin Fields, has green pastures ahead of him.
[13:03.860 --> 13:05.100]  So I'm a little nervous.
[13:05.380 --> 13:09.420]  Magic is on the field now. He wasn't there. He's coming in weird plays every now and then.
[13:09.500 --> 13:13.000]  But now he is starting. He has an opportunity to win the job.
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.220]  This is either like the magic will carry forward. This is a lock to win.
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.500]  Or he will lose the job and the bet will be over by the midseason. I'll come dead last.
[13:21.560 --> 13:22.500]  But I believe in magic.
[13:23.060 --> 13:28.360]  So I've been taking the idea that I'm going to let Najee do the first couple weeks on his own.
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.040]  See what he's capable of before I intervene.
[13:31.340 --> 13:32.060]  You know what I mean?
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.440]  So I'm just kind of playing it fast and loose right now.
[13:35.640 --> 13:38.520]  But I don't want you to think it's because I'm not paying attention.
[13:38.620 --> 13:40.820]  I am. I'm just waiting for the right moment to strike.
[13:40.920 --> 13:46.400]  Fair enough. I would also just recommend to anybody to get some magic in your life.
[13:46.700 --> 13:47.420]  Generally speaking.
[13:47.620 --> 13:50.620]  We can't have too much magic though on the same subject, surely.
[13:50.820 --> 13:51.560]  What do you mean?
[13:51.720 --> 13:54.860]  Because then it will be like that Quidditch match. Everyone's fighting over the same broom.
[13:55.320 --> 13:59.380]  No! No, you just load up on... Are you saying like from the same source?
[13:59.500 --> 14:02.560]  I don't really understand your point. There's no such thing as a cap of too much magic.
[14:02.940 --> 14:03.900]  Or is it like too powerful?
[14:05.080 --> 14:07.060]  No, too much magic on the same subject.
[14:07.280 --> 14:08.060]  Why would that be an issue?
[14:09.280 --> 14:10.120]  Did we lose Gavin?
[14:12.100 --> 14:14.320]  Did we lose Gavin or did he just not reply?
[14:14.840 --> 14:15.740]  Did you not hear me?
[14:16.100 --> 14:16.460]  No!
[14:16.780 --> 14:18.680]  I heard you say too much magic on the same...
[14:18.680 --> 14:20.280]  Yeah, it went quiet for a moment.
[14:20.580 --> 14:20.960]  Oh, subject.
[14:21.600 --> 14:22.660]  Yeah, but I don't...
[14:22.660 --> 14:23.920]  We interpolated that, yeah.
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.200]  Yeah, well regardless of that, I would just recommend people...
[14:27.200 --> 14:29.420]  I don't know what you're trying to say. It's cutting in and out.
[14:29.780 --> 14:32.940]  We're gonna move past it. You're wrong. Whatever you're saying is wrong.
[14:33.080 --> 14:33.900]  It's just incorrect.
[14:35.080 --> 14:40.320]  But I would recommend having magic in your life, having some protection potions on you.
[14:40.360 --> 14:41.060]  Whatever you need.
[14:41.260 --> 14:44.180]  Because I had... I had a really shitty week.
[14:44.380 --> 14:48.260]  And I was like, oh man, I guess this whole magic thing isn't working out.
[14:48.340 --> 14:49.180]  This was the previous week.
[14:49.180 --> 14:54.440]  And then I realized, it was probably heightened by the fact I had the magic.
[14:54.840 --> 14:57.900]  I wouldn't have wanted to go through that week without the magic.
[14:58.140 --> 15:01.800]  I probably would have been gorged by a bull or something as soon as I left the house.
[15:01.840 --> 15:02.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:02.200 --> 15:03.580]  If it wasn't for the magic.
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.560]  As long as you have magic, no matter how bad things are, you can say, oh, I'm glad about that magic.
[15:08.980 --> 15:09.920]  I'm thankful for that.
[15:10.580 --> 15:10.980]  Gorged?
[15:11.400 --> 15:13.060]  Isn't gorged... isn't that what you...
[15:13.060 --> 15:13.860]  Yeah, no, that's work.
[15:13.920 --> 15:15.520]  Yeah, that's... you get gorged by a bull.
[15:15.520 --> 15:18.280]  You get gored, I think is what you were trying to say.
[15:18.280 --> 15:18.700]  Gored?
[15:19.400 --> 15:20.980]  You can say gorged too.
[15:21.660 --> 15:23.980]  Isn't gorging like stuffing your face with...
[15:23.980 --> 15:24.540]  It is!
[15:24.580 --> 15:25.160]  That's if you're...
[15:25.160 --> 15:26.100]  It is, you're right.
[15:26.300 --> 15:27.160]  I said the wrong thing.
[15:27.200 --> 15:27.500]  Isn't that engorging?
[15:27.820 --> 15:28.400]  It is.
[15:28.820 --> 15:30.360]  Not stuffing your face with a bull.
[15:30.640 --> 15:31.920]  That would also be unpleasant.
[15:32.220 --> 15:33.040]  Not what I intended.
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.400]  I meant the stab part, not the eat thing.
[15:35.540 --> 15:35.840]  Gored.
[15:36.020 --> 15:37.940]  If you just get swallowed whole by a bull.
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.120]  That would be terrible.
[15:39.400 --> 15:39.760]  Ah, damn.
[15:40.080 --> 15:43.800]  If I was gonna get killed by a bull, I'd want it to hit me with the horn and not be swallowed.
[15:44.020 --> 15:46.200]  I'd feel disrespected if I got eaten by a bull.
[15:46.380 --> 15:47.420]  Nobody gets eaten by a bull.
[15:47.420 --> 15:51.220]  I appreciate, Andrew, that you put it into perspective.
[15:51.700 --> 15:51.760]  Yeah.
[15:51.840 --> 15:55.520]  And that you, at first you thought, I had a shitty week and magic didn't help.
[15:55.780 --> 15:58.800]  And then you took another look at it and you said, no, wait a minute.
[15:59.100 --> 16:00.740]  Maybe I had, maybe the magic did help.
[16:00.860 --> 16:01.100]  It did.
[16:01.100 --> 16:01.960]  And it would have been that much worse.
[16:02.240 --> 16:05.040]  I had a similar event happen to me yesterday.
[16:05.280 --> 16:07.180]  I clued you guys into it a little bit.
[16:07.800 --> 16:08.460]  I know.
[16:08.660 --> 16:09.680]  Was it yesterday or the day before yesterday?
[16:10.100 --> 16:10.380]  It was yesterday.
[16:10.380 --> 16:15.300]  And at first, I looked at it as a terrible, terrible event.
[16:15.300 --> 16:22.700]  But then I was able to reframe it and see that there was, there was a way to make lemonade out of that anal lemon.
[16:22.940 --> 16:26.280]  And I'm really excited to share that with you guys right now.
[16:26.500 --> 16:28.760]  If you would so indulge.
[16:28.820 --> 16:31.160]  I just want to say there's no magic in what you're about to do.
[16:31.640 --> 16:33.220]  Oh, I think that there is.
[16:33.520 --> 16:39.080]  I, well, first off, I have, the world has been asking, Geoff, we loved Beef Bracelet.
[16:39.400 --> 16:40.140]  We loved it.
[16:40.220 --> 16:41.220]  It was the best.
[16:41.700 --> 16:44.100]  What are you going to follow up Beef Bracelet with?
[16:44.100 --> 16:45.140]  We want to know.
[16:45.300 --> 16:46.200]  We can't wait.
[16:46.360 --> 16:48.260]  And I'm like, it doesn't work that way.
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.940]  Matt, inspiration has to strike, right?
[16:51.420 --> 16:55.740]  Sometimes it has to strike at your lowest, most painful, embarrassing moments.
[16:55.980 --> 16:59.040]  Like, let me just say inspiration struck.
[16:59.440 --> 17:00.360]  And here's how.
[17:00.800 --> 17:02.520]  The other day, I was riding my bike.
[17:02.920 --> 17:04.740]  I got up, I've been riding my bike on a tear.
[17:04.880 --> 17:06.280]  Gavin, I went with you and Trevor the other day.
[17:06.360 --> 17:07.500]  We had a lot of fun riding bikes.
[17:07.640 --> 17:10.320]  Since then, I've averaged more than one bike ride a day.
[17:10.320 --> 17:13.840]  The other day, I got up, I went for a 27-mile bike ride.
[17:15.360 --> 17:16.320]  First thing in the morning.
[17:16.480 --> 17:17.340]  Then I had a full day.
[17:17.460 --> 17:19.040]  Had a great, productive day at work.
[17:19.280 --> 17:21.300]  And then Emily, Emily's with her mom this week.
[17:21.360 --> 17:22.560]  And Emily was working late.
[17:22.640 --> 17:24.840]  And I was kind of home alone and bored.
[17:24.920 --> 17:27.760]  And I thought, oh, I'm going to go for another bike ride.
[17:27.780 --> 17:28.740]  Because I feel pretty good.
[17:29.580 --> 17:35.500]  And I currently have like gallons of Tiger Balm Ultra.
[17:35.900 --> 17:38.620]  Because my lower back has been hurting a bit.
[17:38.620 --> 17:41.920]  And so I've been slathering it on lately.
[17:43.020 --> 17:45.820]  Something that also happens that I'm aware of.
[17:45.980 --> 17:48.160]  And if you ride a lot of bikes, you'll understand this.
[17:48.320 --> 17:50.960]  If you ride your bike, I don't know, 50 miles in a day.
[17:51.060 --> 17:52.660]  It makes your butthole hurt.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.640]  Like the seat of your butt.
[17:55.040 --> 17:59.040]  It makes your, like your, like where your butt, like your butt flap hurts.
[17:59.720 --> 18:01.780]  And it makes it really sore.
[18:02.020 --> 18:03.100]  And so I thought, you know what?
[18:03.180 --> 18:06.600]  Before I get on this fucking bike, I'm going to big brain this.
[18:06.720 --> 18:08.320]  I have all this Tiger Balm Ultra.
[18:08.320 --> 18:11.960]  I put it on my spine all night long to help me out there.
[18:12.160 --> 18:14.380]  I'm going to rub it on my butt cheeks.
[18:14.640 --> 18:17.340]  So that they don't ever get sore.
[18:18.300 --> 18:20.740]  I've lost so much sympathy for your situation.
[18:21.380 --> 18:21.980]  This is not...
[18:21.980 --> 18:24.340]  Okay, so wait, it's the cheeks that hurt.
[18:24.480 --> 18:26.380]  So my butt cheeks, I'm getting there.
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.940]  So when you ride the bike too much, I was anticipating a butt cheek hurt.
[18:31.100 --> 18:33.620]  So I put the Tiger Balm on my butt cheeks.
[18:33.820 --> 18:35.000]  Then I hopped on my bike.
[18:35.240 --> 18:36.500]  My butt was humming.
[18:36.500 --> 18:38.840]  It was on fire in a good way.
[18:39.100 --> 18:40.040]  You know what it's like.
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.200]  I was loving it.
[18:41.380 --> 18:43.460]  And so I start pedaling and pedaling.
[18:43.620 --> 18:44.900]  And I'm having a great time.
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.800]  You know, it's Austin.
[18:46.940 --> 18:48.280]  And it's five in the evening.
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.960]  It's like the hottest part of the day in Austin.
[18:50.280 --> 18:52.800]  So it's like 118 or whatever.
[18:52.860 --> 18:57.600]  And after about, I don't know, six or seven minutes, I start to sweat.
[18:59.180 --> 19:04.780]  And that's when all of the sweat on my body poured across my butt cheeks.
[19:04.780 --> 19:06.740]  And then into my butt hole.
[19:08.040 --> 19:15.580]  And with it, it brought the furious pain of a thousand cuts into my anus.
[19:15.900 --> 19:22.640]  It must have been a half a gallon of Tiger Balm in liquid form went right into my butt hole.
[19:22.920 --> 19:24.360]  This happened while you were riding?
[19:24.800 --> 19:27.980]  It was while I was three miles...
[19:27.980 --> 19:28.860]  I rode...
[19:29.360 --> 19:29.980]  Well, I'll tell you.
[19:30.060 --> 19:31.780]  I did 22 miles that ride.
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.520]  22 and a half miles.
[19:33.520 --> 19:36.020]  Because I did an even 50.
[19:36.340 --> 19:38.720]  Why is your anus not facing down though?
[19:38.820 --> 19:40.000]  It's not like it's defying gravity.
[19:40.020 --> 19:42.700]  I was like three minutes in...
[19:42.700 --> 19:45.140]  Or like three miles in when it started to hurt.
[19:45.680 --> 19:51.580]  And as you know with me, I'm not going to stop the bike ride.
[19:51.880 --> 19:55.000]  When I wrecked that day in the ice, I didn't stop the bike ride.
[19:55.260 --> 19:59.640]  I plugged the holes with mud and ice and I kept riding, right?
[19:59.940 --> 20:02.460]  So I was like, I can't turn around now.
[20:02.460 --> 20:03.500]  That would be admitting defeat.
[20:03.700 --> 20:06.960]  I'm just going to grin and fucking get through it.
[20:06.980 --> 20:10.960]  And I'm texting you guys while I'm riding and sharing my pain with you.
[20:11.340 --> 20:12.560]  And it just gets worse and worse.
[20:12.840 --> 20:14.540]  And then, I didn't even tell you guys this part.
[20:14.840 --> 20:17.460]  Then something, a realization hit me.
[20:18.460 --> 20:23.060]  After everything kind of like, it gets hot and tingly and then it kind of goes numb.
[20:23.300 --> 20:26.080]  Then I realized, what does icy hot do?
[20:26.340 --> 20:29.140]  What does Tiger Balm do when it soothes your muscles?
[20:29.380 --> 20:30.680]  Your sore, tense muscles?
[20:30.680 --> 20:32.220]  It releases them.
[20:32.640 --> 20:35.640]  It makes them numb and then it makes them not tense.
[20:35.820 --> 20:41.300]  And then I thought, I have numbed and unleashed, I've numbed and untensed my asshole.
[20:41.660 --> 20:42.720]  You got to plug that hole with mud, Geoff.
[20:42.720 --> 20:44.100]  Right after the shower incident.
[20:44.280 --> 20:45.720]  Right after the shower incident.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.780]  Where I shit, which by the way, Emily had so much fun telling you guys all the gross details last night.
[20:52.660 --> 20:56.000]  And then I'm sweating, so I'm just wet.
[20:56.120 --> 20:57.440]  I'm just hot and wet everywhere.
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.040]  And I'm thinking, is my butthole leaking?
[21:00.040 --> 21:01.780]  Am I just leaking ass juice?
[21:02.100 --> 21:03.460]  Am I pooping as I ride?
[21:03.820 --> 21:05.740]  And I thought, I'm just not going to look down.
[21:06.080 --> 21:07.180]  I'm just not going to look down.
[21:07.300 --> 21:08.700]  And I'm just going to finish my ride.
[21:08.840 --> 21:10.540]  And I'll just figure it out when I get home.
[21:10.600 --> 21:15.740]  It's like the end of Die Hard 2, where he knocks the gas cap off the plane and then lights on fire.
[21:15.900 --> 21:18.080]  Geoff's just leaving a shit trail on his bike.
[21:18.780 --> 21:20.740]  I mean, maybe I was, maybe I wasn't, I don't know.
[21:20.840 --> 21:24.360]  And I rode all around Town Lake and I thought, well as long as nobody...
[21:24.820 --> 21:26.400]  At least I'm looking at people eye to eye.
[21:26.400 --> 21:29.500]  I don't have to see their reaction when they see behind me.
[21:29.620 --> 21:31.180]  And I'm riding fast.
[21:31.560 --> 21:33.380]  So it's like, I just got to get through this.
[21:33.980 --> 21:35.720]  Were you trying to clench?
[21:36.100 --> 21:38.440]  Or was it the clench that you couldn't feel?
[21:38.600 --> 21:39.500]  I couldn't feel.
[21:40.040 --> 21:40.780]  I couldn't feel.
[21:41.980 --> 21:43.320]  I didn't know if I was clenching or not.
[21:43.860 --> 21:45.580]  You could have been clenching, but you just didn't know.
[21:45.580 --> 21:50.860]  Yeah, it's like when you sleep on your arm wrong and you wake up and you have no control over your arm for 45 seconds.
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.000]  That's what Icy Hot does to your butthole.
[21:53.100 --> 21:54.060]  Or in this case, Tiger Bomb.
[21:55.660 --> 21:58.140]  And so yeah, my butthole was asleep.
[21:58.660 --> 22:05.040]  Like my ring was asleep for two hours or however long I was on the bike ride.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.760]  The whole ride was about an hour and a half.
[22:08.840 --> 22:10.240]  So probably about an hour and 15 minutes.
[22:10.620 --> 22:12.140]  Maybe an hour and 10.
[22:12.740 --> 22:18.420]  Anyway, got home and just so you guys know, I ran straight to the shower.
[22:19.940 --> 22:22.560]  And I was completely clean.
[22:23.100 --> 22:23.760]  Totally fine.
[22:23.760 --> 22:25.700]  And at some point it stopped hurting.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.440]  And I'll also say, my butt cheeks never hurt the entire time.
[22:31.540 --> 22:35.880]  Like that 50 mile bike ride, and I've been on two bike rides since then, butt cheeks have been fine all week.
[22:36.160 --> 22:38.420]  So in the end, it worked.
[22:38.780 --> 22:39.900]  Now, that's not my...
[22:40.420 --> 22:41.300]  It clearly didn't work.
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.820]  What do you mean it worked?
[22:42.840 --> 22:43.500]  Also, you said...
[22:43.500 --> 22:44.320]  My butt cheeks never hurt.
[22:44.380 --> 22:45.860]  You said you're perfectly clean.
[22:46.080 --> 22:49.320]  You had like a paste of sweat and Tiger Bomb alleviated.
[22:49.500 --> 22:51.300]  Yeah, I mean, I had sweat.
[22:51.460 --> 22:53.440]  I rode a bike for two hours in the sun.
[22:53.440 --> 22:55.420]  Of course, I didn't have shit on me.
[22:55.640 --> 22:56.840]  I didn't have poopies anywhere.
[22:57.020 --> 22:57.760]  I didn't have diarrhea.
[22:58.140 --> 23:02.700]  I didn't leave a trail of poop breadcrumbs like I did in the fucking hotel in Vegas.
[23:03.080 --> 23:03.500]  None of that.
[23:03.600 --> 23:05.160]  It was just that part was clean.
[23:05.500 --> 23:11.320]  But anyway, through the course of talking to you guys, and I was telling you guys I needed relief.
[23:11.440 --> 23:17.060]  Andrew, you recommended that I put milk in my butt because that's what you do with jalapenos, right?
[23:17.100 --> 23:17.740]  You drink milk.
[23:19.720 --> 23:24.740]  And that time that I got jalapenos on my dick, I stuck my dick in milk and that did help.
[23:25.660 --> 23:28.200]  I think I told you that story once or maybe it was on a different podcast.
[23:29.860 --> 23:32.140]  And I was like, yeah, but how am I going to put milk in my butthole?
[23:32.360 --> 23:34.260]  And then you were like, well, you could take a milk bath.
[23:34.360 --> 23:36.860]  And I was like, dude, I got another 20 miles of this bike ride to go.
[23:36.960 --> 23:38.080]  I ain't gonna be doing that anytime soon.
[23:38.380 --> 23:41.340]  And I also, who's got enough milk to fill a bathtub?
[23:41.780 --> 23:42.560]  Certainly not me.
[23:44.560 --> 23:56.240]  But anyway, in the course of that, inspiration struck and I came up with what I think is, and Nick has heard none of this, so I'll get his unfiltered opinion, which I'm really excited about.
[23:56.420 --> 23:57.740]  I came up with an idea for a product.
[23:58.240 --> 24:03.060]  I'm just gonna go ahead and, without saying it, I'm just gonna go ahead and post the images.
[24:04.200 --> 24:08.860]  I've made a logo for it.
[24:09.060 --> 24:09.980]  I'll do that one first.
[24:10.200 --> 24:10.520]  Oh, no.
[24:10.520 --> 24:12.400]  And then I made like a tagline.
[24:12.560 --> 24:15.220]  And I did some photography for it.
[24:15.260 --> 24:17.860]  And here's the product.
[24:18.920 --> 24:21.460]  How do I attach an image?
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.720]  That's horrifying.
[24:25.260 --> 24:25.960]  Upload file.
[24:26.980 --> 24:28.660]  It looks like a pasta.
[24:29.720 --> 24:30.920]  Oh, you guys can see it.
[24:30.960 --> 24:31.800]  An icicle to make.
[24:32.340 --> 24:35.680]  Okay, I present to you the Too Spicy Icy.
[24:35.860 --> 24:38.740]  This is an all dairy product.
[24:38.740 --> 24:43.540]  What I have done is I took a turkey baster, and I took the top off, and I filled the turkey baster.
[24:43.580 --> 24:44.740]  Well, I taped the bottom of it.
[24:44.820 --> 24:46.220]  Then I filled it with milk.
[24:46.560 --> 24:47.080]  Pure milk.
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.640]  And then I stuck a stick in it, and I froze it.
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.460]  And what I've created is a long cylindrical device I call the Too Spicy Icy.
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.180]  If you have a sore butthole, because maybe you ate spicy food last night.
[25:01.260 --> 25:02.980]  I know I do that all the time.
[25:03.040 --> 25:04.460]  Maybe you had some Memphis hot chicken.
[25:04.740 --> 25:08.020]  Or maybe you had some extra spicy jalapenos on your nachos.
[25:08.020 --> 25:10.580]  Or maybe you rubbed Tiger Balm all up in your asshole.
[25:10.820 --> 25:12.100]  I know how to solve it.
[25:12.240 --> 25:16.860]  You can take this all dairy product and shove it gently into you.
[25:17.020 --> 25:20.520]  It will cool you and has the added benefit of...
[25:20.520 --> 25:21.120]  Think about this.
[25:21.600 --> 25:23.220]  What does milk do for you guys?
[25:23.640 --> 25:24.460]  What does it do for you?
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.060]  Strengthens your bones.
[25:26.060 --> 25:28.320]  It builds strong bones and a healthy smile.
[25:28.600 --> 25:30.620]  What's the most important bone in your body?
[25:30.780 --> 25:31.700]  Your spine.
[25:31.700 --> 25:38.200]  What a fucking awesome way to get a calcium injection right up your spine.
[25:38.320 --> 25:40.280]  It's gonna make you stronger.
[25:41.040 --> 25:43.060]  It's gonna take away your butt pain.
[25:43.440 --> 25:45.100]  And it goes even better.
[25:45.300 --> 25:46.400]  Because here's the next image.
[25:46.800 --> 25:47.580]  Oh no.
[25:48.360 --> 25:49.060]  Here's the next image.
[25:49.480 --> 25:50.300]  Oh, I like this one.
[25:50.380 --> 25:51.360]  I'm really excited about this one.
[25:52.300 --> 25:54.100]  From the fine folks at Uniform.
[25:54.420 --> 25:58.200]  Let the milk from our cows soothe your anus owls.
[25:58.420 --> 26:00.800]  See, and there's a picture of a cow in the snow.
[26:00.800 --> 26:02.840]  This is great for a couple of reasons, right?
[26:02.980 --> 26:04.120]  That's a catchy slogan.
[26:04.480 --> 26:06.580]  Let the milk from our cows soothe your anus owls.
[26:06.780 --> 26:11.520]  And we barely have talked about it, but as you know from Beef Bracelet,
[26:11.780 --> 26:14.520]  which is a subsidiary of F*** Face Industries,
[26:14.640 --> 26:16.400]  which is a subsidiary of Fluke Face,
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.700]  which is a subsidiary of a highly secretive, very rarely talked about,
[26:22.060 --> 26:25.360]  but often alluded to company called Uniform.
[26:25.740 --> 26:26.140]  Uniform.
[26:27.080 --> 26:29.800]  Combining the fabric of the farm with the power of one.
[26:29.800 --> 26:30.500]  Uniform.
[26:30.660 --> 26:33.220]  This is another perfect Uniform product.
[26:33.620 --> 26:37.680]  We make the milk that we freeze that you put in you.
[26:37.940 --> 26:43.140]  And because I had so much fun last time making the video for, you know,
[26:43.200 --> 26:48.120]  I made a spec video to show how we would promote and how Beef Bracelet would work.
[26:48.260 --> 26:50.240]  I made a little commercial for you guys.
[26:50.580 --> 26:51.520]  So I'm going to submit...
[26:51.520 --> 26:51.560]  No.
[26:51.560 --> 26:52.800]  Here's a video for you to watch.
[26:52.820 --> 26:53.440]  It's real short.
[26:53.820 --> 26:55.300]  Oh, my file's too powerful.
[26:55.580 --> 26:56.200]  How do I do this?
[26:56.240 --> 26:57.360]  Alright, I'll put it in...
[26:57.360 --> 26:58.620]  Here's what I'll do.
[26:58.620 --> 27:00.400]  I'll put it in Slack.
[27:02.240 --> 27:03.820]  Are you done with images?
[27:04.460 --> 27:05.400]  I'm done with images.
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.620]  Every time you say I have another image, I'm waiting to see you with a popsicle in your ass.
[27:09.700 --> 27:10.920]  I really don't want to see it.
[27:11.000 --> 27:11.620]  So I'm glad...
[27:12.220 --> 27:13.440]  Then watch this video.
[27:13.920 --> 27:14.440]  Oh, no.
[27:15.140 --> 27:16.560]  Alright, it's uploading now.
[27:16.660 --> 27:17.080]  There it is.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.160]  Okay, I gotta go to Slack.
[27:20.760 --> 27:21.320]  Oh, God.
[27:22.140 --> 27:24.500]  There are so many flaws with this plan.
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.280]  The turkey baster shape is awful.
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.020]  Because it's pointed at the end.
[27:30.180 --> 27:31.720]  It just looks like a milk spike.
[27:31.940 --> 27:34.920]  It looks like the last thing I would want anywhere near my anus.
[27:35.200 --> 27:36.480]  So, I understand what you're saying.
[27:36.760 --> 27:41.400]  And I think that people are going to have different anal tastes for that kind of thing.
[27:41.440 --> 27:41.960]  I get that.
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.780]  I also think that there's room for us to consider making...
[27:46.780 --> 27:49.800]  And I don't have one at home, so I couldn't make a prototype of it easily.
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.860]  But to kind of consider making like a pacifier that you can just kind of pop in.
[27:55.140 --> 27:55.340]  Right?
[27:55.440 --> 27:56.460]  And that kind of cradles your butthole.
[27:56.700 --> 27:57.480]  Video is uploaded.
[27:57.480 --> 27:58.960]  I would like you to please watch it now.
[27:59.360 --> 27:59.840]  Alright.
[28:00.120 --> 28:00.680]  Watching it.
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.040]  I'll watch it too.
[28:14.080 --> 28:15.380]  It's so long.
[28:23.730 --> 28:27.050]  Firstly, it's way too long to...
[28:27.050 --> 28:28.370]  It's only 37 seconds.
[28:28.650 --> 28:30.070]  No, not length in video.
[28:30.230 --> 28:34.670]  The ice frickin' spike would skewer the back of your anus.
[28:34.790 --> 28:36.670]  It would hit the bend in your intestine.
[28:36.690 --> 28:37.770]  That's gonna get you...
[28:37.770 --> 28:39.450]  No, see, that's the nice thing about it.
[28:39.610 --> 28:41.710]  It's gonna come with...
[28:41.710 --> 28:43.330]  And I'm glad that you brought that up.
[28:43.610 --> 28:44.550]  We're gonna make it...
[28:44.550 --> 28:45.950]  People are different sizes.
[28:46.350 --> 28:48.550]  So what you do is you sell a one size fits all.
[28:48.870 --> 28:51.570]  But then we include what I like to call...
[28:51.570 --> 28:52.810]  It's almost like a cigar cutter.
[28:53.070 --> 28:53.230]  Right?
[28:53.350 --> 28:57.750]  And then you can cut it to the length of your preferred anal depth.
[28:57.870 --> 28:58.530]  It's awful.
[28:58.910 --> 28:59.790]  Yeah, so you just go like...
[29:00.710 --> 29:02.790]  You can just cut it down to the size that works for you.
[29:04.270 --> 29:05.810]  And I'll be honest with you.
[29:06.450 --> 29:07.650]  And I'm being totally honest.
[29:07.710 --> 29:10.610]  I think that might be the best video I've ever made in my life.
[29:10.610 --> 29:11.810]  I'm so happy with it.
[29:11.890 --> 29:12.990]  I'm so proud of it.
[29:13.130 --> 29:17.130]  I feel like I've done such a good job of relaying what's happening.
[29:17.470 --> 29:22.230]  And how fucking relieved and soothed I am without being graphic.
[29:22.690 --> 29:25.710]  It looks like one of Wolverine's claws before the adamantium.
[29:30.310 --> 29:34.590]  I like that you brought up, Gavin, that it is going to just stab your anus.
[29:34.770 --> 29:35.930]  And Geoff's response is...
[29:35.930 --> 29:36.990]  Listen, I hear ya.
[29:38.170 --> 29:38.650]  But...
[29:42.080 --> 29:43.160]  You didn't solve anything.
[29:43.380 --> 29:47.260]  You just created a new problem and then created an even worse solution for that problem.
[29:47.320 --> 29:50.480]  And it's just going to freeze and burn your sensitive anus skin.
[29:50.580 --> 29:54.800]  It's going to shred your ass from the cold and from the spike.
[29:55.060 --> 29:59.560]  It's probably second to a knife in terms of things that you should pop your ass.
[30:01.540 --> 30:02.600]  Well, I don't know.
[30:02.660 --> 30:03.120]  I don't know.
[30:03.200 --> 30:04.540]  We're going to have to focus test it.
[30:04.640 --> 30:07.340]  I think that might be a little harsh.
[30:07.340 --> 30:12.520]  I think that you might find that there are a lot of people who would appreciate the soothing nature of dairy.
[30:13.040 --> 30:14.200]  I could just...
[30:14.200 --> 30:17.920]  Like, as soon as it goes in, it's like anally licking a pole in the winter.
[30:18.140 --> 30:19.340]  It just gets stuck.
[30:23.010 --> 30:24.010]  Like you have a milktail.
[30:24.770 --> 30:29.230]  I think you're also forgetting how warm it is inside your butthole.
[30:29.690 --> 30:31.250]  That's why people check temperatures now.
[30:31.370 --> 30:32.750]  It's going to melt very quickly.
[30:33.150 --> 30:35.110]  It might melt as fast as you kind of put it in.
[30:35.710 --> 30:37.690]  It's like the worst survivor challenge.
[30:37.690 --> 30:40.710]  When people stand over a plate.
[30:41.510 --> 30:43.150]  You have to show Geoff the stick.
[30:47.430 --> 30:49.090]  Show me the stick.
[30:49.510 --> 30:51.530]  Geoff, I think...
[30:51.530 --> 30:56.850]  Now, I will say that stick, I would not recommend the stick I used.
[30:56.990 --> 30:58.050]  I used a skewer.
[30:58.930 --> 31:01.610]  You put a skewer? You're trying to sell it.
[31:01.830 --> 31:03.330]  What are you talking about?
[31:03.330 --> 31:04.470]  You put a real skewer?
[31:04.470 --> 31:05.210]  What?
[31:06.910 --> 31:08.430]  Well, that's all I had.
[31:08.470 --> 31:09.990]  That's why I'm saying it's a prototype.
[31:10.830 --> 31:11.730]  That's all I had.
[31:12.210 --> 31:17.810]  I love everything I've made.
[31:18.030 --> 31:19.570]  These are fantastic products.
[31:19.790 --> 31:23.490]  I already asked Aaron yesterday if we can sell frozen products.
[31:27.210 --> 31:29.290]  You don't know that yet.
[31:29.530 --> 31:31.290]  The audience hasn't responded.
[31:32.110 --> 31:36.870]  I'm telling you, there's 7.5 billion people on Earth.
[31:37.130 --> 31:39.790]  I can't be the only one that sees the value in this.
[31:40.150 --> 31:41.210]  You don't even like milk.
[31:41.390 --> 31:42.850]  No, I don't. I don't like milk at all.
[31:43.870 --> 31:44.930]  That's an excellent point.
[31:45.230 --> 31:47.310]  But, you know what I do like? Thanks for asking.
[31:47.570 --> 31:52.210]  I like lactose-free milk because that lets me eat cereal again without having the tummy aches.
[31:52.250 --> 31:55.050]  We've talked about that. That's why I have all the Cap'n Crunch now, thanks to Andrew.
[31:55.050 --> 32:01.170]  You'll notice in the gorgeous picture that I created for the Too Spicy Icy logo,
[32:01.630 --> 32:06.710]  there is both lactose-full and lactose-free milk displayed,
[32:07.010 --> 32:11.470]  giving the impression that we would make a lactose-free option for people like myself.
[32:11.810 --> 32:15.370]  What about chocolate? Is there going to be a chocolate version of this?
[32:15.470 --> 32:19.230]  Can we have a variety of flavor? What is the end goal?
[32:19.410 --> 32:20.590]  How much can you farm off?
[32:20.610 --> 32:24.350]  I think it's going to become chocolate on its own.
[32:24.350 --> 32:29.270]  Geoff, do you think you can tell what percent milk it is by shoving it in your asshole for a second?
[32:31.750 --> 32:32.930]  I don't think so.
[32:33.010 --> 32:34.290]  The worst magic trick.
[32:34.970 --> 32:37.790]  I think the only thing you can take from it is the grip level.
[32:47.340 --> 32:53.180]  Going online without ExpressVPN is like changing while leaving your window wide open.
[32:53.520 --> 32:59.640]  You might not have anything to hide, but why give random creeps a chance to invade your privacy?
[32:59.640 --> 33:02.340]  That's why everyone needs a VPN.
[33:03.040 --> 33:10.340]  Like, for instance, let's say you are one of the preeminent collectors on this planet
[33:10.340 --> 33:19.020]  of certain highly sought-after pewter or porcelain cutlery, if you will,
[33:19.600 --> 33:26.380]  and you wanted to maybe keep the particulars of that interest secret.
[33:26.940 --> 33:29.380]  Why I would recommend a VPN?
[33:30.320 --> 33:32.000]  Why not even ExpressVPN?
[33:32.400 --> 33:40.800]  You can browse more anonymously, so no one's going to know about the spoons and the thimbles that you are or are not buying.
[33:41.220 --> 33:45.560]  It is easy to use. You just fire up the app and you click one button.
[33:45.720 --> 33:50.300]  Then your data is encrypted for maximum protection, and it works on all devices.
[33:50.700 --> 33:54.560]  I know when I'm browsing or buying stuff or doing whatever it is I do or don't do
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.840]  that's related to collectible spoons and thimbles, I do it on my phone or my laptop,
[34:00.200 --> 34:05.540]  sometimes even a router, and that stuff's all protected thanks to ExpressVPN.
[34:06.200 --> 34:06.920]  Woohoo!
[34:07.720 --> 34:11.160]  That's why it's personally important to use ExpressVPN.
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.480]  Secure your online activity by visiting expressvpn.com slash face today.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.240]  That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s vpn.com slash face

[34:29.900 --> 34:31.680]  General talking points.
[34:32.040 --> 34:36.880]  TUSHY, the modern bidet company, washes away even the messiest of poops,
[34:37.020 --> 34:40.400]  leaving you with a better clean than toilet paper.
[34:40.760 --> 34:44.700]  Discuss your worst poop experiences and how TUSHY could have helped.
[34:44.980 --> 34:49.960]  I have discussed my worst poop experiences ad nauseum on this podcast
[34:49.960 --> 34:53.400]  and all podcasts that predate this one.
[34:53.760 --> 34:58.920]  Literally listen to any time I have spoken about myself or my body in the past
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.660]  and I am talking about catastrophic toilet issues.
[35:04.140 --> 35:08.980]  That's why you need a TUSHY, because your butt isn't clean enough to sit on a couch naked
[35:08.980 --> 35:11.160]  until you've TUSHED.
[35:11.620 --> 35:16.520]  Think about it, if you got poop on any other part of your body, would you just wipe it off?
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.420]  Probably not. You'd wash it. With water, at least.
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.860]  That's why TUSHY is important. Wash your butthole. It had poop on it.
[35:25.280 --> 35:30.660]  TUSHY is the modern bidet for people who poop. Just poop, wash, and pat dry.
[35:31.100 --> 35:34.280]  The TUSHY bidet features in this order of priority.
[35:34.900 --> 35:38.500]  It washes your bum with water for a better clean than toilet paper.
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.860]  Washing with water is less irritating and more soothing for your b-hole.
[35:43.160 --> 35:44.520]  Easy to install.
[35:44.520 --> 35:49.700]  Using a TUSHY bidet reduces toilet paper use by 80%.
[35:49.700 --> 35:52.400]  It is eco-friendly and stylish.
[35:53.180 --> 35:56.680]  Start washing with a TUSHY bidet for a better clean.
[35:57.160 --> 36:03.120]  Go to hellotushy.com slash face to get 10% off plus free shipping.
[36:03.400 --> 36:05.900]  This is a special offer for our listeners.

[36:13.780 --> 36:15.800]  And at hellotushy on Instagram.
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.260]  I also love this product picture. It's so small on the plate.
[36:23.500 --> 36:30.160]  I wanted to fit the pretty flower bouquet and then the milk.
[36:30.500 --> 36:31.900]  The three different kinds of milk in as well.
[36:32.300 --> 36:34.840]  That's why I zoomed in and put it on the right.
[36:35.400 --> 36:41.380]  It's on the side. The main picture is a white thing on a white plate on a white counter.
[36:41.780 --> 36:43.960]  And it's about 15% of the image.
[36:44.320 --> 36:48.060]  Yeah, but think of it poster size. It would really stand out.
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.240]  If we made posters, 24 by 36 posters, it would pop.
[36:55.360 --> 36:58.280]  Can we put this on a billboard somewhere? No context.
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.260]  I don't know why we can't. I think it's a great idea.
[37:02.260 --> 37:05.220]  I think it's a great idea. We should put it on a billboard.
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.640]  I own that image and I smudged out the H-E-B logo on all the milks.
[37:10.140 --> 37:14.220]  Yeah, let's put it on a billboard and see if anyone knows what it is.
[37:14.780 --> 37:18.160]  We need a phone number. Call if you think you know what this is.
[37:18.660 --> 37:22.260]  Call to order now and then just see what the calls are.
[37:24.160 --> 37:28.240]  On their way to work, be like, hey, did you see that Too Spicy Icy billboard?
[37:28.640 --> 37:29.720]  What do you think that is?
[37:29.720 --> 37:37.380]  I wish we had a comment leaver in the audience who was like, I don't know, a billionaire.
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.280]  And who was occasionally like, just gonna do that, you know?
[37:41.600 --> 37:46.400]  So I'm saying we should waste all of the sponsor money on stuff like this.
[37:47.060 --> 37:52.100]  Yeah, you're right. Instead of relying on the made-up billionaire to do it.
[37:52.240 --> 37:54.660]  Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, take the company money.
[37:54.660 --> 38:01.900]  If you show this to a hundred people, what percentage do you think realizes that this is an anal product?
[38:02.640 --> 38:09.520]  Zero. There's nothing about this. You would never think that. You would never make that leap.
[38:10.060 --> 38:14.980]  I love that you're saying this. I'm right there with you. That's part of the strength of it, right?
[38:15.120 --> 38:17.940]  No, it's not. I didn't mean this as a positive.
[38:18.660 --> 38:22.040]  Yeah, no, it is a positive. You're right. It's all about perspective, Andrew.
[38:22.040 --> 38:26.160]  We discussed this. Magic is in the air, buddy. Magic is in the air.
[38:26.500 --> 38:30.520]  We could put this on the Instagram and just type, like, where does this go? And see what people think.
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.660]  Like, what is this for? Oh, thank you, Gavin. That reminds me of your thing.
[38:38.460 --> 38:43.180]  Yeah, we could do that. I'm still trying to process the fact that you think you can throw a baseball.
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.120]  80 miles per hour, Geoff. Yeah, of course I can.
[38:47.820 --> 38:52.760]  And I meant to tweet to ask people just to see, like, on what range you are.
[38:53.280 --> 38:58.020]  Yeah. Do you think... now, is the spicy... what is it?
[38:58.020 --> 39:00.740]  Too spicy, icy. Too spicy, icy. Yeah.
[39:01.200 --> 39:04.700]  Could you just use that as a popsicle? Like, it doesn't have to be an anal thing, right?
[39:04.700 --> 39:08.920]  Well, I wouldn't put it... well, I mean, if you wanted a milk popsicle, yeah, sure.
[39:09.380 --> 39:11.260]  Yeah. But that's not what it's designed for.
[39:11.800 --> 39:17.020]  I don't think it's designed for what you're saying it's designed for. It's on a skewer and it's as sharp as a knife.
[39:17.020 --> 39:20.200]  I think I designed it, Andrew, and I know what I designed it for.
[39:20.420 --> 39:22.360]  I think you did a horrible job.
[39:22.740 --> 39:24.260]  You didn't solve any problems.
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.760]  What problems did you solve today, sir? At least I tried.
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.300]  I didn't have any problems. At least I identified a need in the world.
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.380]  I watched Survivor perfectly fine. My power stayed intact.
[39:38.080 --> 39:40.900]  Oh, now you're going to brag about your awesome Canadian power.
[39:41.380 --> 39:46.480]  Yeah, yeah, I will. I will. I watched both Tribal Councils. It was great.
[39:48.020 --> 39:49.400]  I had no problems.
[39:49.980 --> 39:51.620]  I have that audio clip.
[39:51.900 --> 39:53.100]  Oh, what audio clip?
[39:53.880 --> 39:56.480]  From earlier. Let's see if you can hear this.
[39:56.580 --> 39:56.840]  Okay.
[39:58.520 --> 40:05.900]  Interesting. Guiding Light, 15,000 episodes. Oprah Winfrey Show, 4,500. Jerry Springer Show, 5,084.
[40:06.340 --> 40:12.460]  Interesting. Because on the Jerry Springer Show Wikipedia page, it's listed as 4,969.
[40:12.460 --> 40:16.200]  I wonder if they roll in some of the Steve Show in that, potentially.
[40:16.640 --> 40:17.800]  What's the Steve Show?
[40:17.900 --> 40:20.460]  Well, you know that cop that was like the security guy?
[40:24.340 --> 40:25.560]  I'm playing the wrong bit.
[40:28.240 --> 40:30.180]  I was like, this is so long.
[40:31.460 --> 40:33.220]  Oh, it started right after. Here we go.
[40:33.540 --> 40:33.740]  What?
[40:34.360 --> 40:36.480]  I want like an episode breakdown book.
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.200]  Like it's just a fully, every episode written down and him giving little notes about each show.
[40:41.200 --> 40:44.960]  Just a giant encyclopedia sized thing of trash.
[40:45.180 --> 40:50.140]  Hey man, I don't know if you've, I don't know if you checked the trash lately, but Eric's got some conflicting information.
[40:50.520 --> 40:50.700]  What?
[40:53.160 --> 40:54.240]  You said trash?
[40:54.720 --> 40:54.960]  Yeah.
[40:55.340 --> 40:57.240]  And Geoff said, I don't know if you've checked the trash recently.
[40:57.400 --> 40:58.780]  When he was talking about the chat.
[41:02.440 --> 41:05.880]  It seems like I would have done that on purpose, but I can't come up with a reason why.
[41:08.860 --> 41:10.240]  Eric said that was worth it.
[41:12.040 --> 41:14.120]  I just like that none of us noticed.
[41:14.800 --> 41:16.540]  We've got to pay attention on these.
[41:16.740 --> 41:18.220]  You can't let stuff like that pass.
[41:18.340 --> 41:19.900]  It's hard to listen while you're talking though.
[41:20.140 --> 41:20.420]  It is.
[41:21.060 --> 41:24.480]  I'm just thankful nobody barked at Geoff.
[41:25.300 --> 41:25.960]  What a relief.
[41:26.100 --> 41:28.020]  God, that was a weird thing, man.
[41:28.760 --> 41:29.680]  Stop barking.
[41:30.080 --> 41:36.340]  Well anyway, that's my next product. I can't promise when I'll have a third, but you know, uniforms cranking away.
[41:36.800 --> 41:39.700]  I'm going to start talking to some distributors.
[41:39.820 --> 41:40.080]  That's not something you wear though.
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.920]  If you're interested in investing, I have a lead on a new product.
[41:46.240 --> 41:48.260]  I'm not very far along.
[41:48.600 --> 41:56.720]  I can tease it a little bit, but I have identified that one problem with this product could be milk residue and what to do with it.
[41:57.380 --> 41:58.300]  Milk leakage.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.980]  I was thinking if you could create a pair of milk pants that absorbs and recycles the milk.
[42:06.240 --> 42:13.900]  Kind of like Paul Atreyu's outfit in Dune, where it recycled all the pee and sweat into drinkable water.
[42:14.080 --> 42:17.360]  If we could maybe come up with a way to filter the milk leakage.
[42:17.960 --> 42:19.720]  You could water plants with it or something.
[42:20.340 --> 42:21.500]  Anyway, we're working on that.
[42:22.180 --> 42:24.180]  If you're interested in investing, just let me know.
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.460]  Could I potentially enhance the product, Geoff?
[42:27.980 --> 42:29.140]  Always. Always.
[42:29.560 --> 42:30.540]  That's what I want to hear.
[42:30.740 --> 42:32.500]  I want to hear some enthusiasm from you.
[42:33.140 --> 42:35.160]  Zero enthusiasm. I don't think this should exist.
[42:35.300 --> 42:39.940]  But if you're going to make it, I feel like that's a much better scale and option.
[42:40.500 --> 42:42.400]  You can wear it. It fits within the uniform.
[42:42.600 --> 42:44.040]  As Gavin said, not wearable.
[42:44.500 --> 42:45.220]  But you got that.
[42:45.960 --> 42:46.680]  I like that.
[42:47.420 --> 42:49.440]  What that is, is you posted a ring pop.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.280]  I think a ring pop is very similar to a pacifier, which is what I was saying earlier.
[42:54.740 --> 42:56.440]  That's a great direction to go with it.
[42:56.440 --> 42:57.720]  Thanks. I appreciate it.
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.540]  I agree with you.
[42:58.620 --> 43:00.900]  Because it's not as deep and there's an easy way to get it out.
[43:00.940 --> 43:04.560]  And it's also a little wider for a heftier person.
[43:04.940 --> 43:06.860]  Not all buttholes are the same size.
[43:07.380 --> 43:10.920]  I don't think anything needs to go past the sphincter.
[43:11.100 --> 43:14.340]  I think it's all surface-level tingles and numbness.
[43:14.500 --> 43:17.780]  I don't think anything needs to go inside your anus.
[43:17.940 --> 43:20.740]  It's just the end of the anus that feels the spice.
[43:20.780 --> 43:21.240]  I don't know, man.
[43:21.240 --> 43:23.920]  You don't feel the spice six inches up.
[43:23.920 --> 43:26.820]  I felt like I felt it pretty deep yesterday or the day before.
[43:27.040 --> 43:29.280]  How many inches up the asshole?
[43:29.520 --> 43:30.540]  Maybe an inch up.
[43:32.100 --> 43:33.600]  Maybe a ring pop's the way, then.
[43:33.840 --> 43:35.560]  Taking it back to the beginning of this.
[43:35.840 --> 43:38.960]  I'd love to hear Eric and Gavin's thoughts.
[43:39.200 --> 43:44.520]  We got a text leading into this of Geoff just saying that he got tiger balm in his asshole.
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.540]  What did you imagine the context of that was?
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.160]  Did you put any thought into it?
[43:51.160 --> 44:00.580]  I personally thought it was a thing where he applied it to a part of his body, didn't fully remove it from his finger, and then wiped his ass and accidentally got it.
[44:00.880 --> 44:03.920]  I thought it'd be like when you eat something spicy and you accidentally touch your eye.
[44:04.580 --> 44:06.760]  No, exactly. That's what I assumed.
[44:06.860 --> 44:10.340]  I never would have guessed that this happened in the middle of a bike ride.
[44:10.460 --> 44:12.620]  It was a solution for numbing.
[44:12.740 --> 44:16.500]  The fact that he applied it to the ass area is shocking.
[44:16.900 --> 44:18.440]  Oh, you didn't realize I had done that?
[44:18.440 --> 44:21.040]  No, I assumed it was much more accidental.
[44:21.680 --> 44:23.340]  I lost all sympathy for you and your problem.
[44:23.360 --> 44:23.980]  It was an accident.
[44:24.300 --> 44:29.340]  You put the tiger balm in a danger zone and you paid the price.
[44:29.500 --> 44:30.900]  You played with fire and it happened.
[44:31.080 --> 44:33.460]  It wasn't where it was supposed to be.
[44:34.120 --> 44:39.780]  Listen, first off, I don't know that it matters how it got there.
[44:40.500 --> 44:41.600]  It absolutely does.
[44:42.160 --> 44:43.600]  What matters is that it's there.
[44:44.140 --> 44:46.440]  And that I'm dealing with it and suffering in the moment.
[44:46.440 --> 44:48.340]  Who cares how it happened?
[44:49.400 --> 44:50.440]  I just... I don't...
[44:51.640 --> 44:52.740]  And they call it a fix.
[44:53.280 --> 44:57.600]  It's like you burnt your hands, put on gloves, and then burnt the rest of your body and was like,
[44:57.680 --> 44:59.620]  I fixed the issue. My hands are fine.
[44:59.760 --> 45:00.680]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.760]  I don't think that that's accurate at all.
[45:05.020 --> 45:05.420]  Huh?
[45:06.320 --> 45:06.980]  It's ridiculous.
[45:07.200 --> 45:08.480]  How does that make... it makes no sense.
[45:09.660 --> 45:15.500]  You burn your butthole, you put... it's the same thing I put my dick in when I got jalapeno juice on it.
[45:15.500 --> 45:16.280]  I know.
[45:16.460 --> 45:18.700]  I assume it's gonna work exactly the same.
[45:18.960 --> 45:21.420]  That was just liquid milk though, wasn't it?
[45:21.640 --> 45:21.940]  Yeah.
[45:22.540 --> 45:25.200]  Were you just dunking your cock and balls in a cup?
[45:25.580 --> 45:25.840]  Yeah.
[45:26.800 --> 45:33.640]  So what's stopping you from just, like, sticking your legs either side of your head and just pouring a shot of milk into your ring?
[45:34.220 --> 45:37.640]  That's essentially what I'm doing, but it's a lot less messy the way I'm doing it.
[45:38.200 --> 45:40.800]  Do you have a... do you have a milk funnel for your butthole?
[45:41.920 --> 45:42.800]  What, specifically?
[45:43.560 --> 45:43.960]  What?
[45:44.220 --> 45:46.340]  I also don't have an ice cube tray.
[45:46.620 --> 45:48.580]  Don't touch that. That's my butthole funnel.
[45:49.600 --> 45:53.060]  You don't need one because you'll buy the product from me.
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.080]  You're not making it yourself, you're buying it from me.
[45:56.980 --> 45:58.800]  You're selling a turkey face stuff.
[45:58.800 --> 46:04.460]  You'll probably... we'll probably buy it from CVS or H-E-B or wherever, Randall's, whatever grocery store you go to.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.580]  Probably have some sort of a... I would assume.
[46:06.900 --> 46:11.060]  Like a, oh, maybe like a linens and things or like Bed Bath and Beyond, I could see us being there.
[46:11.060 --> 46:14.980]  I'm just much more on board with Andrew's Ring Pop.
[46:15.200 --> 46:15.880]  Yeah. Sting Pop.
[46:16.140 --> 46:17.580]  The Sting Pop I like, I like that.
[46:18.160 --> 46:21.660]  The Too Spicy Icy Plug, Nick said, is good as well.
[46:21.960 --> 46:23.960]  Sting Pop, I think what we do is we workshop names.
[46:24.540 --> 46:24.840]  You know?
[46:25.460 --> 46:26.420]  All about that.
[46:26.520 --> 46:31.740]  I also, while I like, I do kind of like the jewel shape of it though.
[46:31.800 --> 46:34.800]  I hope Ring Pop doesn't have...
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.220]  Is it the Bellagio in Vegas that has that fountain outside of it that shoots the water up?
[46:40.280 --> 46:41.600]  I'm just imagining that with milk.
[46:42.980 --> 46:45.180]  That's what we could do for our launch party.
[46:45.720 --> 46:47.600]  17 dudes squatting over it.
[46:48.580 --> 46:51.160]  I think the end of Ocean's Eleven, significantly better.
[46:53.600 --> 46:55.700]  Anyway, what do you guys got?
[46:57.440 --> 46:59.580]  I don't, I don't know how to follow that up, Geoff.
[47:00.820 --> 47:02.300]  Well, what about your homework, Andrew?
[47:02.640 --> 47:03.540]  Oh, Eric's got a question.
[47:03.540 --> 47:05.200]  Oh, Eric has a question. Yes, sir.
[47:05.540 --> 47:07.800]  Just quickly, and then we can move on to Andrew's homework.
[47:08.600 --> 47:14.020]  You said specifically that this was to stop your tiger balm burn.
[47:14.200 --> 47:15.660]  Is that right?
[47:16.160 --> 47:17.720]  In this instance, yes.
[47:17.760 --> 47:20.140]  It would be to soothe the tiger balm burn.
[47:20.360 --> 47:27.620]  But I also then immediately realized that when I have too spicy food, my butthole burns in a similar way.
[47:27.860 --> 47:30.740]  And so I think that it would work for that as well.
[47:30.740 --> 47:33.780]  Does milk help, like, tiger balm?
[47:34.940 --> 47:36.500]  I don't, I don't know.
[47:36.700 --> 47:39.000]  I figured that we would find out.
[47:39.100 --> 47:42.360]  But it definitely, but it definitely helps jalapeno burn.
[47:42.520 --> 47:48.040]  Right. And Nick is sort of driving at what I was kind of wanting to know.
[47:48.480 --> 47:50.020]  Did you test this?
[47:50.340 --> 47:51.560]  Oh, no.
[47:52.380 --> 47:52.980]  No.
[47:54.180 --> 47:54.680]  Should you?
[47:54.680 --> 48:01.360]  By the time I got it all, by the time I got the milk frozen, I felt fine.
[48:01.580 --> 48:03.720]  Oh, what did you do to soothe the burn?
[48:04.220 --> 48:04.960]  I waited it out.
[48:05.000 --> 48:05.700]  Oh, you just waited.
[48:06.100 --> 48:06.500]  Oh, okay.
[48:06.960 --> 48:07.980]  I like the idea of this.
[48:08.920 --> 48:13.500]  The pain is over so soon that you don't have time to pour the milk and freeze it.
[48:13.580 --> 48:15.120]  You need to have one of these in your freezer.
[48:15.140 --> 48:16.920]  Oh, I had plenty of time to pour the milk and freeze it.
[48:17.060 --> 48:17.520]  I just didn't.
[48:17.960 --> 48:23.220]  You have to realize I also had another hour and a half bike ride before I got home to even get to the milk.
[48:23.880 --> 48:26.020]  And I had to conceive of the product.
[48:26.100 --> 48:27.640]  I had to build the structure.
[48:27.640 --> 48:30.520]  I had to find tape that was waterproof.
[48:31.260 --> 48:31.880]  That was a thing.
[48:32.440 --> 48:33.580]  It took a while.
[48:34.120 --> 48:35.740]  Sounds to me like you have homework this week, Geoff.
[48:35.920 --> 48:37.220]  Well, you have homework.
[48:37.380 --> 48:38.720]  I had homework, yeah.
[48:38.960 --> 48:40.840]  Well, it's not much to talk about.
[48:41.980 --> 48:43.820]  Turns out jet skis are expensive.
[48:44.560 --> 48:45.060]  Yes, they are.
[48:45.520 --> 48:46.340]  Well, we knew that.
[48:46.420 --> 48:48.940]  Yeah, well, I'm working on it.
[48:49.840 --> 48:51.480]  It's not an immediate process.
[48:51.480 --> 48:51.920]  I'm working.
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.920]  I'm throwing things out there.
[48:54.040 --> 48:54.860]  I'm trying my best.
[48:55.180 --> 48:55.960]  I've expanded.
[48:56.680 --> 49:01.020]  So I think we need to maybe re-evaluate this stunt a little bit.
[49:01.260 --> 49:03.680]  And think about where our floor is.
[49:03.960 --> 49:05.720]  Like, what are we happy with with a base thing?
[49:06.060 --> 49:09.500]  So I kind of want to cover the bases.
[49:09.740 --> 49:10.680]  I'm still working.
[49:11.280 --> 49:12.580]  I'll get a response eventually.
[49:12.760 --> 49:13.380]  I'll figure out.
[49:13.520 --> 49:16.300]  I didn't know what to put the subject line in the email for this.
[49:17.980 --> 49:19.640]  But I'm covering everything.
[49:19.840 --> 49:21.140]  So we got jet skis.
[49:21.140 --> 49:22.820]  I've reached out to a few jet ski places.
[49:23.480 --> 49:25.860]  I also, just to make sure we have something.
[49:26.240 --> 49:26.940]  Have a floor.
[49:27.260 --> 49:30.080]  Have also reached out to a few electric wheelchair companies.
[49:30.260 --> 49:32.220]  I figured you guys could scoot on by each other.
[49:32.320 --> 49:33.120]  Give a little high five.
[49:33.540 --> 49:35.600]  So we got a ground level.
[49:36.300 --> 49:37.240]  Because they're a lot.
[49:37.460 --> 49:38.440]  I think they're cheaper.
[49:39.360 --> 49:40.100]  They're significantly.
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.100]  You could just take them.
[49:42.460 --> 49:43.840]  An omelette is cheaper.
[49:43.940 --> 49:44.640]  We don't want one.
[49:44.700 --> 49:45.180]  What do you mean?
[49:45.820 --> 49:47.360]  Well, it sounds to me.
[49:47.520 --> 49:49.140]  Like you guys really wanted to do this.
[49:49.260 --> 49:50.700]  High five while passing each other.
[49:51.080 --> 49:52.160]  I think I would.
[49:52.340 --> 49:54.260]  Hey, I'd love for it to be a jet ski.
[49:54.460 --> 49:55.640]  I'd be a big fan of that.
[49:55.860 --> 49:58.260]  But, you know, sometimes it doesn't work out that way.
[49:58.460 --> 50:01.500]  You don't replace a jet ski with an electric scooter.
[50:01.680 --> 50:03.900]  You replace a jet ski with a layover boat.
[50:04.340 --> 50:06.120]  We have a floor, Geoff.
[50:06.280 --> 50:07.440]  The floor is the.
[50:07.500 --> 50:07.940]  I tell you what.
[50:07.960 --> 50:09.600]  The floor is the water's surface.
[50:10.400 --> 50:11.300]  It's gotta be.
[50:11.300 --> 50:12.220]  It's gotta float.
[50:12.640 --> 50:14.040]  Well, you didn't give me that instruction.
[50:14.200 --> 50:15.580]  You just said get a jet ski.
[50:15.700 --> 50:17.520]  And, you know, jet skis are expensive.
[50:17.840 --> 50:19.500]  Get a jet ski is the instruction.
[50:19.740 --> 50:25.460]  No, I thought the real heart and goal of this mission was to have you two high five while going in different directions.
[50:25.620 --> 50:25.980]  Andrew.
[50:26.140 --> 50:27.160]  We could do that on foot.
[50:27.300 --> 50:29.380]  Yeah, but nobody wants to see that on foot.
[50:29.500 --> 50:31.600]  There's a vehicle involved in some way.
[50:31.660 --> 50:33.140]  Some form of transportation.
[50:33.820 --> 50:35.780]  And so I just wanted to start on a ground level.
[50:35.980 --> 50:38.900]  If you can float an electric scooter, I'm all about it.
[50:38.900 --> 50:40.180]  It doesn't have to be a jet ski.
[50:40.420 --> 50:42.980]  As long as it floats and it's propelled.
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.040]  In a world where people are shoving milk icicles up their ass, I don't see why I can't get a floating.
[50:49.620 --> 50:50.340]  I don't either.
[50:51.040 --> 50:55.500]  I believe in the ingenuity of Andrew Panton.
[50:56.100 --> 50:56.360]  Okay.
[50:56.680 --> 50:59.080]  So you want. It has to be on the water.
[50:59.500 --> 50:59.940]  Specifically.
[51:00.420 --> 51:01.900]  It can't be on land.
[51:02.240 --> 51:03.500]  It's not just the high five.
[51:03.660 --> 51:05.760]  Because you brought up being on your bike, Geoff.
[51:05.760 --> 51:07.820]  It's the high five mixed.
[51:08.200 --> 51:09.700]  It's the high five mixed.
[51:10.080 --> 51:11.760]  Wait, which stunt are we doing?
[51:12.360 --> 51:13.700]  Are we doing the one where I'm on my bicycle
[51:13.700 --> 51:15.880]  and we do the high five at the bike and the jet ski
[51:15.880 --> 51:17.840]  crosses in the air? I can't remember if Eric
[51:17.840 --> 51:18.840]  shit on that or not.
[51:18.920 --> 51:21.640]  I thought we were doing hands on a stick on jet skis.
[51:21.700 --> 51:23.300]  Hands on a stick on a jet ski. Okay, cool.
[51:23.620 --> 51:25.600]  Because I wanted to go more extreme with it, but I remember
[51:25.600 --> 51:27.440]  Eric being all like, I'm scared of
[51:27.440 --> 51:28.740]  extreme stuff and stuff.
[51:29.120 --> 51:31.140]  So, uh, okay.
[51:31.360 --> 51:32.860]  So yeah, it should probably be
[51:33.360 --> 51:34.960]  two jet skis or maybe
[51:34.960 --> 51:36.540]  two boats of some kind. Okay.
[51:36.760 --> 51:38.800]  Speed boats. Boats are gonna be
[51:38.800 --> 51:40.100]  easy to get. Okay.
[51:40.620 --> 51:42.840]  You know what? I'll go back to the lab.
[51:42.940 --> 51:44.680]  I'll continue with my homework. You have homework too.
[51:45.080 --> 51:46.580]  I'll come back with an update next week.
[51:47.180 --> 51:48.960]  I reached out to a few places. Haven't heard back.
[51:49.140 --> 51:51.020]  Didn't even hear back from the wheelchair company.
[51:51.420 --> 51:53.100]  I don't actually
[51:53.100 --> 51:54.220]  want to put this in my butt.
[51:55.080 --> 51:56.400]  Well, you've made it. I thought...
[51:56.400 --> 51:58.600]  No, well, it's too late.
[51:58.760 --> 52:00.840]  I thought doing all the work
[52:00.840 --> 52:02.400]  the other work I did was enough.
[52:03.200 --> 52:04.820]  I think just get a fingertip of
[52:04.820 --> 52:06.240]  tiger balm around the anus.
[52:06.380 --> 52:06.980]  Dude, I don't...
[52:06.980 --> 52:09.200]  I don't...
[52:09.200 --> 52:12.420]  do not want to do that again.
[52:12.580 --> 52:14.160]  But you made a whole product video.
[52:14.280 --> 52:15.300]  It has to be tested.
[52:15.580 --> 52:17.220]  I made the product video
[52:17.620 --> 52:19.340]  so you can continue to do it.
[52:20.420 --> 52:22.540]  The whole point of the product is so you can do this
[52:22.540 --> 52:24.760]  and then relieve yourself from the side effects of it.
[52:26.020 --> 52:26.780]  What do you mean
[52:26.780 --> 52:27.820]  you don't want to do it again?
[52:28.280 --> 52:29.840]  Do you really want a comment
[52:29.840 --> 52:31.900]  leaver to be the first person to stick a milk
[52:31.900 --> 52:33.980]  ice cream on their butt? It has to be you.
[52:34.100 --> 52:35.820]  I don't like that being out there.
[52:36.640 --> 52:37.600]  I don't think that...
[52:37.600 --> 52:40.260]  I don't think anyone should... Consult a professional.
[52:41.180 --> 52:41.960]  What do you mean?
[52:42.060 --> 52:43.140]  You just made a product.
[52:43.300 --> 52:45.320]  This whole episode was about the product.
[52:45.440 --> 52:47.000]  It's on spec. It hasn't...
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.620]  It hasn't gotten FDA approval yet.
[52:48.620 --> 52:50.740]  You just said seek a professional. What do you mean?
[52:50.760 --> 52:52.320]  I wonder what the professional will say.
[52:54.360 --> 52:55.780]  They're not going to say yes,
[52:55.780 --> 52:57.760]  Geoff. I do know this.
[52:58.780 --> 52:59.860]  It needs to be
[52:59.860 --> 53:01.820]  open and closed by you, Geoff.
[53:01.940 --> 53:04.000]  We need closure on this.
[53:04.060 --> 53:05.620]  Alright, I'll think about it.
[53:05.720 --> 53:06.500]  What do you mean?
[53:07.460 --> 53:08.720]  I'll think about it.
[53:08.820 --> 53:11.260]  What are you doing?
[53:11.740 --> 53:12.760]  What are you talking about?
[53:14.060 --> 53:15.440]  What am I talking about?
[53:15.500 --> 53:17.660]  You just pitched... I just listened for
[53:17.660 --> 53:19.960]  30 minutes. You talk about how great this product
[53:19.960 --> 53:22.040]  is and then we ask you to use it
[53:22.040 --> 53:23.240]  and you're like, I don't want to.
[53:23.240 --> 53:24.580]  Go seek a professional.
[53:24.760 --> 53:26.180]  What are you talking about?
[53:26.640 --> 53:27.620]  What was this episode?
[53:30.320 --> 53:31.400]  Nick's saying I should
[53:31.400 --> 53:33.300]  be behind a curtain and have Emily record
[53:33.300 --> 53:35.200]  my reaction. Oh, man.
[53:35.720 --> 53:36.960]  That's like some old Howard
[53:36.960 --> 53:39.200]  Stern shit, Nick. You know what you're doing.
[53:40.460 --> 53:41.420]  Yes, Nick.
[53:41.680 --> 53:42.940]  That's like Scott the Engineer
[53:42.940 --> 53:44.480]  and the porn star.
[53:45.880 --> 53:46.540]  Lexington Steel.
[53:47.020 --> 53:48.660]  It's not as extreme.
[53:49.720 --> 53:50.020]  No.
[53:50.740 --> 53:52.100]  I also love the flip
[53:52.100 --> 53:53.860]  of this. Geoff came in so excited
[53:53.860 --> 53:55.960]  to talk about this product and he's now
[53:55.960 --> 53:57.580]  dreading it. You've gone too far.
[53:57.720 --> 53:59.380]  I'm only going about an inch in anyway.
[53:59.500 --> 54:01.720]  And you know what? The milk, you can tell.
[54:02.040 --> 54:04.000]  You can see how far you went. It could be like
[54:04.000 --> 54:04.880]  a combine stat.
[54:05.580 --> 54:08.000]  I think we've been going
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.080]  long. Pretty long.
[54:09.520 --> 54:12.260]  I think we're probably at time.
[54:12.860 --> 54:14.060]  Okay. Well, I don't think
[54:14.060 --> 54:16.040]  that changes anything as far as your homework goes.
[54:16.300 --> 54:18.080]  Does anybody else have anything else they want to cover?
[54:18.840 --> 54:19.860]  I talked about
[54:19.860 --> 54:20.480]  magic.
[54:22.780 --> 54:24.160]  I'm doing a podcast.
[54:24.600 --> 54:24.680]  What?
[54:25.120 --> 54:27.640]  Sort of. Not really. So I got
[54:27.640 --> 54:29.920]  somebody message
[54:29.920 --> 54:32.020]  me and asked if I
[54:32.020 --> 54:34.060]  could help with a college project thing
[54:34.060 --> 54:36.040]  that they were working on. And I've had this happen a few
[54:36.040 --> 54:37.900]  times. Typically, it's just like
[54:37.900 --> 54:40.160]  they ask some questions and it's like an interview type thing.
[54:41.580 --> 54:41.960]  That's just
[54:41.960 --> 54:43.080]  someone who wants to talk to you.
[54:43.500 --> 54:46.140]  You know, it's part of an assignment.
[54:46.500 --> 54:48.080]  It's different than just talking to me.
[54:49.100 --> 54:50.400]  And I had somebody ask
[54:50.400 --> 54:52.040]  and they're like, hey, could you help with this thing?
[54:52.060 --> 54:54.120]  And I said, sure. And then they
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.100]  said, okay, would you
[54:56.100 --> 54:57.720]  do a podcast with me?
[54:58.160 --> 55:00.080]  Which is not what I was expecting. I thought it would just be a few
[55:00.080 --> 55:02.100]  questions. I said, okay, I could probably
[55:02.100 --> 55:04.240]  do that. What is the podcast on?
[55:04.700 --> 55:06.200]  And then they replied, I've got no
[55:06.200 --> 55:07.180]  idea. What do you think?
[55:07.940 --> 55:10.060]  Okay. So if you guys have
[55:10.060 --> 55:12.240]  podcast ideas, I could use this.
[55:12.720 --> 55:13.520]  I could take this.
[55:13.520 --> 55:15.500]  What? I don't understand.
[55:15.600 --> 55:16.900]  What do you mean? Why are you confused by that?
[55:18.680 --> 55:19.640]  I'm doing one
[55:19.640 --> 55:21.240]  episode of a podcast for a college
[55:21.240 --> 55:23.680]  assignment with this person. I don't know what it should be about.
[55:24.020 --> 55:25.040]  What should the topic be?
[55:27.820 --> 55:29.380]  I'm telling you it's not going to be about
[55:29.380 --> 55:31.480]  anal icicles or whatever that
[55:31.480 --> 55:33.640]  was. French Revolution. Okay.
[55:33.960 --> 55:34.820]  Spanish-American War.
[55:36.280 --> 55:37.260]  And that's why
[55:37.260 --> 55:39.480]  you're going to learn. So that you can make an
[55:39.480 --> 55:41.460]  entertaining podcast. You'll be enriched.
[55:41.460 --> 55:43.600]  Just make a sports podcast and then
[55:43.600 --> 55:45.720]  everyone will be happy that it's not on this, I guess.
[55:45.920 --> 55:47.020]  I'm not really clear on that.
[55:47.360 --> 55:49.420]  What if I did sports and survivor? Perfect.
[55:49.780 --> 55:50.420]  That's great.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.480]  That really didn't go anywhere.
[55:53.720 --> 55:55.580]  I feel like it would have been better if I said
[55:55.580 --> 55:57.600]  nothing. What do you mean? Why did you
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.720]  think it was going to go somewhere?
[55:59.580 --> 56:01.420]  Geoff was like, does anyone have anything?
[56:01.620 --> 56:03.380]  And I was thinking, well, what's happened recently?
[56:03.400 --> 56:05.580]  And I brought that up. And everybody, it was like
[56:05.580 --> 56:07.680]  I fucking popped all the balloons in the room
[56:07.680 --> 56:09.540]  and it just went dead.
[56:10.200 --> 56:11.660]  My attempt to bring
[56:11.660 --> 56:13.720]  anything beyond what Geoff said
[56:13.720 --> 56:15.380]  was actually a negative
[56:15.380 --> 56:15.980]  result.
[56:17.180 --> 56:19.860]  I would have been better off just not saying a word
[56:19.860 --> 56:21.600]  that I was trying to say something.
[56:21.820 --> 56:22.400]  Is what I'm saying.
[56:23.160 --> 56:25.160]  Eric, how's your butthole been lately?
[56:25.960 --> 56:27.600]  No! No more butthole.
[56:27.860 --> 56:29.020]  We're done with the buttholes.
[56:30.540 --> 56:31.580]  Andrew is
[56:31.580 --> 56:33.540]  so disappointed
[56:33.540 --> 56:35.680]  that no one wanted to help him
[56:35.680 --> 56:37.620]  invent a new podcast
[56:37.620 --> 56:39.940]  for someone else.
[56:40.180 --> 56:41.680]  Everybody gave you an idea.
[56:41.820 --> 56:44.020]  What more do you want? Do you need a producer for you too?
[56:44.220 --> 56:45.380]  You gave me two ideas.
[56:45.700 --> 56:47.840]  Everyone was baffled by the idea.
[56:48.220 --> 56:49.360]  Went dead silent.
[56:50.180 --> 56:50.700]  Yeah.
[56:51.480 --> 56:53.720]  I'm not disappointed in that it wasn't a
[56:53.720 --> 56:55.640]  fucking great thing, but there was a
[56:55.640 --> 56:57.520]  level of disgust by
[56:57.520 --> 56:58.960]  everybody in this call.
[56:59.440 --> 57:01.300]  And I'm just trying to talk about a thing.
[57:02.120 --> 57:03.520]  I'll be... Andrew,
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.920]  can I dispel something right now?
[57:05.920 --> 57:07.720]  If you picked up
[57:07.720 --> 57:09.640]  on any kind of
[57:09.640 --> 57:11.960]  impression that I was disgusted
[57:12.680 --> 57:13.700]  with you
[57:13.700 --> 57:15.380]  making a high school project
[57:15.700 --> 57:17.280]  or a college project with some kid,
[57:19.000 --> 57:19.780]  it had
[57:19.780 --> 57:21.700]  zero to do with that and more to do with the fact that I am
[57:21.700 --> 57:23.520]  running through how
[57:23.520 --> 57:25.840]  in my head, how much
[57:25.840 --> 57:27.820]  I love this, how much do I actually
[57:27.820 --> 57:29.620]  care about this podcast, and can I
[57:29.620 --> 57:31.460]  physically put a fucking
[57:31.460 --> 57:33.380]  milk popsicle up my butthole
[57:33.380 --> 57:34.940]  for a bit or not?
[57:35.320 --> 57:37.020]  If not, how do I get out of it?
[57:37.240 --> 57:39.080]  And I realize that I've painted myself into a
[57:39.080 --> 57:40.840]  fucking corner here.
[57:42.440 --> 57:43.300]  And I'm just
[57:44.220 --> 57:44.660]  struggling.
[57:45.480 --> 57:47.700]  I'm just struggling
[57:47.700 --> 57:48.680]  about... I'm thinking about
[57:49.260 --> 57:51.480]  how my joke went wrong
[57:51.480 --> 57:53.160]  and I'm trying to...
[57:53.160 --> 57:53.980]  I think you were very right.
[57:54.880 --> 57:56.140]  I disagree that it went wrong.
[57:57.320 --> 57:59.220]  You were picking up on something else.
[58:00.680 --> 58:01.260]  I can't wait
[58:01.260 --> 58:03.300]  for you to not do this, and I'm excited
[58:03.300 --> 58:05.140]  to see what the comment leavers yell at you.
[58:05.260 --> 58:07.620]  I have eat the pencil. Oh, this will be Geoff's
[58:07.620 --> 58:09.020]  pencil. Yeah, what is the
[58:09.020 --> 58:10.920]  combination of words? I already had that. I had the stupid...
[58:10.920 --> 58:12.800]  I had the goddamn port-a-potty.
[58:12.900 --> 58:15.280]  Put a bit of graphite through the middle of the ice spike
[58:15.280 --> 58:16.380]  and we're in the same situation.
[58:20.020 --> 58:21.280]  I'm trying to decide if I
[58:21.280 --> 58:23.260]  would trade with Geoff. I don't think I would.
[58:23.260 --> 58:25.280]  I already had the port-a-potty. I got shit on for the
[58:25.280 --> 58:27.220]  port-a-potty forever. Well, not really, but
[58:27.220 --> 58:28.840]  I feel like... And, and, and,
[58:28.840 --> 58:30.440]  and I had the goddamn
[58:30.440 --> 58:32.080]  dipping sauce controversy.
[58:33.320 --> 58:34.920]  That was largely just
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.960]  a miscommunication. I think we both thought
[58:36.960 --> 58:38.800]  the other person was doing a bit
[58:38.800 --> 58:40.860]  and we both were confused. I don't think that
[58:40.860 --> 58:43.040]  that was...
[58:43.540 --> 58:44.880]  That was just us being
[58:44.880 --> 58:45.460]  confused.
[58:47.880 --> 58:48.860]  Genuinely, I was
[58:48.860 --> 58:50.800]  thinking about it. Geoff, do you think that's the most
[58:50.800 --> 58:52.920]  heated conversation we've had
[58:52.920 --> 58:54.660]  in the entirety of our friendship?
[58:55.520 --> 58:56.900]  You and I? I can't think of any...
[58:56.900 --> 58:59.400]  Yeah, I can't think of a single thing that would come close.
[58:59.800 --> 59:00.400]  I can't imagine we've ever
[59:00.400 --> 59:03.000]  come close. Yeah, it's just
[59:03.000 --> 59:03.780]  of all things.
[59:05.060 --> 59:06.660]  Pencil bullshit, you know?
[59:07.000 --> 59:07.240]  Yeah.
[59:08.540 --> 59:11.080]  The only time we've ever even come close to heated
[59:11.080 --> 59:12.660]  has been for comedy. Yeah.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.040]  But I feel like that, that was not...
[59:15.040 --> 59:16.980]  That was like one that extended beyond that.
[59:17.620 --> 59:18.620]  Gavin, on the other hand,
[59:18.720 --> 59:20.980]  I hate that motherfucker half the time I'm around him.
[59:21.600 --> 59:22.920]  Henry, it's okay.
[59:22.980 --> 59:24.700]  Who, me? What? What'd you say?
[59:24.700 --> 59:26.720]  I don't think I've ever
[59:26.720 --> 59:28.600]  had an argument with Gavin. Henry's
[59:28.600 --> 59:30.620]  barking at a fucking toy. Although Gavin doesn't
[59:30.620 --> 59:32.640]  even know I have a fucking cat for 20 years, so I don't
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.600]  know what we'd argue about. I don't think this...
[59:34.600 --> 59:36.400]  You never told me! I definitely did!
[59:36.480 --> 59:38.900]  It was in episode three, or whatever the show!
[59:39.180 --> 59:40.620]  You've been told! A cat is
[59:40.620 --> 59:42.700]  like a part of a story that's
[59:42.700 --> 59:44.560]  about you eating shit in a
[59:44.560 --> 59:46.580]  bathroom. The cat's not the
[59:46.580 --> 59:48.540]  bit you pay attention to. The whole point I was in
[59:48.540 --> 59:50.600]  the bathroom was the cat! It's the center of the
[59:50.600 --> 59:52.700]  story! That is true. That is
[59:52.700 --> 59:54.760]  true. I mentioned Coolio three
[59:54.760 --> 59:56.400]  times! You didn't know that! It's fair!
[59:57.280 --> 59:58.000]  It's fair.
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.680]  You're right. That was, once again,
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.720]  that was, you know what, Geoff? I now apologize to
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.700]  you, because that was my icicle thing. I was
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.680]  stunned by the fact that Gavin didn't know
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.500]  Nancy Drew. So I was just lost.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.800]  I was just in the clouds. This is the most scatterbrained
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.240]  podcast. This
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.800]  should be the last thing you listen to
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.680]  if you've just recovered from a stroke.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.560]  This is one of the worst
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.700]  podcasts to follow. It's completely incoherent.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.320]  You know, you know
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.800]  what's interesting about this podcast, though, that I'll
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.000]  say, is that the waves
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.700]  that we ride and then crest
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.660]  and go on, and how they change, right?
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.700]  Like, you're right. This is a scatterbrained
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.540]  mess of a podcast
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.000]  right now. What's confusing
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.960]  to me, disparate ideas that I feel
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.860]  like we have, like, little tendrils
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.720]  of comedy bits that we could go
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.820]  and then we just die on the vine because we get
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.820]  distracted by somebody jangling their keys over
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.300]  here, and then we go to the other thing.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.540]  I feel like that's where we are right now.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.320]  But, like, previously, I was thinking about
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.180]  this. There was a good
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.300]  period of, I don't know,
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.360]  of this podcast where I no
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.380]  longer trusted either of you to the
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.300]  point where I didn't want to have a conversation with you
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.200]  outside of the podcast because I didn't, I couldn't
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.340]  trust the conversation. And I don't feel that way
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.100]  at all right now. And that was, like
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.220]  Eric says, that was like months. I feel like we're
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.340]  totally past that wave of distrust
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.300]  and backstabbing, and now we're all just
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.380]  chasing
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.540]  squirrels.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.200]  I mean, there was
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.340]  even Nick was, Nick says
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.180]  even he was on edge.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.660]  Is this our, like, paranoia
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.120]  refractory period? Yeah.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.360]  I think so. Do I talk about the thing I
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.420]  talked about when Geoff left yesterday?
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.580]  Or last time we did this? Did I bring that up?
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.380]  No, what was that? There was a
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.380]  thing. There's, you know, maybe
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.320]  a little bit of a scheme of
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.340]  sorts was talked about that
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.120]  was decided not worth doing.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.500]  You didn't do it? No.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.160]  Well, maybe?
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.420]  I don't know.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.440]  Was that teasing?
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.280]  That was so
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.180]  unconvincing that it didn't
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.840]  bother me in the least, either way.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.680]  No, that's fine.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.340]  Also, Eric wants us to plug
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.160]  the scrumping signs are coming soon.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.060]  Oh, are they out yet? Are they in the store yet?
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.980]  I just did that. They're not in the store yet.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.880]  By the time this is out, hopefully,
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.460]  but...
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:19.840]  No one's gonna be listening to this
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.400]  on the 23rd of September, Eric.
[01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:25.110]  Happy birthday,
[01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.250]  Millie Ramsey, by the way.
[01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.550]  Today my daughter turns
[01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.130]  16 years old, sweetie.
[01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.050]  Millie Ramsey, September 23rd,
[01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.550]  2005. The world got better.
[01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:37.190]  Also,
[01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:38.590]  oh, I know one thing.
[01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:41.290]  The bat knobs are coming out October 1st, right?
[01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:43.310]  That's a note
[01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.530]  I had in my phone. I still don't understand.
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.210]  It still doesn't make sense,
[01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:48.790]  but that's fine. The bat knobs,
[01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:51.250]  October 1st, got us no scrumping
[01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.490]  signs. We saw some pretty sweet
[01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.330]  Go Go Now shirt designs,
[01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:57.350]  so I guess that'll be a thing at some point in the future
[01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.330]  as well. Does it
[01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.290]  matter? If it's not out
[01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:01.810]  right now.
[01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:05.270]  What do you mean, Eric? What are you butthurt about?
[01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:07.150]  Oh, oh!
[01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.510]  If somebody's butthurt, I got a solution!
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.200]  I've been waiting
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.060]  for this moment!
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:20.960]  Somehow,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.280]  that podcast was full circle.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:24.420]  Amazing.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.080]  Thank you for listening
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.300]  to another episode of
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.120]  F*** Face. If you enjoyed it,
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.120]  consider buying any of the
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.140]  products that we talked about recently
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.080]  that may or may not be in the store today
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.180]  or some point
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:41.240]  in the future.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.620]  If you want to tell a friend
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.860]  to listen to the podcast, we sure would.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.740]  Appreciate it. Also, don't forget
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.760]  to check us out on YouTube. We have a YouTube
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.920]  channel, and we will put videos up
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.740]  there, in addition to the audio podcast,
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.800]  but also videos like the, I don't know, maybe the
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.580]  promotional video that I just filmed
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.340]  for the Too Spicy Icy, or
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.620]  Gavin on a Jet Ski, or
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.060]  whatever we come up with next.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:05.960]  And also,
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.920]  don't be afraid to write a review
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.800]  and rate us.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.180]  As long as you rate us well.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.780]  Well, you know what? I'm not your boss. If you want
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.780]  to give us a shitty rating, give us a shitty rating.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.280]  It's your opinion, right? This is America,
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.220]  or the country that you live in.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.240]  I don't know if you can say that in the country you live in.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.940]  If you're like, well, this is, I don't know,
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.840]  China, I don't know if that means the same
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.660]  thing as it does what we say here. I'm not sure
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.660]  how communism works, but we would
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.460]  like a positive review, or a negative review.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.240]  How about this? We'd like an honest review.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.100]  We love you, and we'll see you next week.
