[00:34.730 --> 00:35.350]  What?
[00:35.550 --> 00:38.910]  I'm looking up stuff about things.
[00:39.710 --> 00:40.770]  You missed a whole thing.
[00:40.810 --> 00:40.990]  What does that mean?
[00:41.290 --> 00:42.750]  What the fuck is that?
[00:43.070 --> 00:44.090]  You missed a whole thing.
[00:44.090 --> 00:48.210]  There was a whole argument at the end of, well, yeah, I guess last episode.
[00:48.330 --> 00:49.790]  It'd be fair to say the end of it after it.
[00:49.870 --> 00:50.450]  That's true, yes.
[00:50.810 --> 00:54.090]  There's a brief argument that I had to do some research on.
[00:54.470 --> 00:55.190]  What was the argument?
[00:55.530 --> 00:59.050]  I guess we should save it. Do I bring it up now? I guess we're recording.
[00:59.890 --> 01:01.970]  Gavin will be here in a minute. It's about taste buds.
[01:02.450 --> 01:02.890]  What about them?
[01:03.190 --> 01:07.550]  We had a little bit of an argument about taste buds and their possible locations,
[01:07.550 --> 01:08.550]  where they can be in the body.
[01:08.970 --> 01:09.710]  They're on your tongue.
[01:09.910 --> 01:12.570]  They're on your tongue. I said that they were also in your ass,
[01:12.570 --> 01:14.010]  and that's why you felt spicy things.
[01:14.290 --> 01:15.410]  Oh, I forgot about this.
[01:15.670 --> 01:19.450]  Well, I will say, and Gavin will have to corroborate this,
[01:19.510 --> 01:20.590]  there was a bit on the Howard...
[01:20.590 --> 01:21.450]  Oh, I guess Eric would know, too.
[01:21.490 --> 01:23.130]  There was a bit on the Howard Stern years ago,
[01:23.210 --> 01:27.110]  where Richard Christie was able to correctly identify flavors of beer
[01:27.110 --> 01:29.590]  poured into his ass five out of six times.
[01:30.210 --> 01:32.550]  I don't think that was to do with any taste bud, though.
[01:32.650 --> 01:36.670]  I just assumed that was sort of the feel and maybe the aroma.
[01:36.950 --> 01:40.090]  What do you mean, the feel? The anal feel of beer?
[01:40.450 --> 01:40.910]  What do you mean?
[01:40.910 --> 01:42.230]  You've got nerves.
[01:42.870 --> 01:46.410]  Okay, but I don't think I could tell the feel if it was in my mouth.
[01:46.830 --> 01:49.750]  If you pour me, like, seven different types of drinks...
[01:49.750 --> 01:50.230]  Liquid's liquid.
[01:50.350 --> 01:51.310]  It's... yeah, it's liquid.
[01:51.670 --> 01:53.110]  You couldn't just... you couldn't tell, like,
[01:53.650 --> 01:56.550]  carbonation or viscosity through your mouth?
[01:56.990 --> 01:59.910]  I get... but I... that's not... like, taste.
[02:00.130 --> 02:01.530]  Taste would be the factor, not feel.
[02:02.010 --> 02:03.610]  I bet you all liquids feel the same.
[02:03.930 --> 02:05.390]  Yeah, I'm kind of with Andrew on that.
[02:05.430 --> 02:06.370]  I mean, maybe not identical,
[02:06.370 --> 02:11.930]  but I don't think six beers feel different enough to tell with your butthole.
[02:12.370 --> 02:16.890]  Maybe you could tell the difference between, like, motor oil and, like, Pepsi or something.
[02:17.310 --> 02:19.590]  But I don't know that you could tell the difference from beer to beer.
[02:20.010 --> 02:20.370]  Yeah.
[02:20.550 --> 02:23.390]  Well, how come you don't taste a poo coming out of it?
[02:23.490 --> 02:25.770]  Oh, that's a... I don't like that.
[02:25.810 --> 02:27.750]  Well, you're the one who said you got a taste bud in your ass.
[02:27.750 --> 02:29.410]  That's what I thought. That's what I heard.
[02:29.570 --> 02:31.310]  So I did some research.
[02:31.490 --> 02:32.290]  Who from?
[02:32.470 --> 02:33.690]  What do you mean? I don't know.
[02:33.830 --> 02:34.750]  Where do you learn anything?
[02:34.750 --> 02:37.290]  I can't source most of the stuff I've learned.
[02:39.370 --> 02:40.310]  Where did you learn?
[02:40.430 --> 02:41.910]  Well, that was going to be a real dumb one.
[02:42.030 --> 02:43.950]  Wow, I'm glad I cut myself.
[02:44.610 --> 02:45.810]  That was going to be...
[02:45.810 --> 02:47.310]  No, don't worry about it. We're good.
[02:47.670 --> 02:50.510]  But I did some Googles. I did some Googling.
[02:50.950 --> 02:53.790]  And I found out there are not taste buds in your ass.
[02:53.890 --> 02:56.210]  That was wrong, but I was directionally correct.
[02:57.530 --> 03:01.870]  There are taste receptors in your ass as well as all over your body.
[03:01.950 --> 03:03.590]  You got taste receptors all over the place.
[03:03.590 --> 03:04.650]  I think they're in your balls.
[03:05.010 --> 03:05.730]  They're everywhere.
[03:06.250 --> 03:07.430]  They're in useless places.
[03:07.950 --> 03:08.910]  I don't know.
[03:09.210 --> 03:10.210]  They're in useless places.
[03:10.350 --> 03:11.530]  It sounded like scientists.
[03:11.610 --> 03:15.070]  So from my interpretation, scientists were like, where are their taste receptors?
[03:15.230 --> 03:16.990]  Holy fuck, there are taste receptors everywhere.
[03:17.370 --> 03:18.050]  We don't know why.
[03:18.390 --> 03:19.590]  We don't know why this is this way.
[03:19.970 --> 03:21.270]  But you got them all over the place.
[03:22.130 --> 03:22.890]  Including the butt.
[03:23.070 --> 03:23.830]  Including the asshole.
[03:24.330 --> 03:26.370]  I don't think I've ever tasted anything with anything else.
[03:26.830 --> 03:27.850]  Like on purpose?
[03:28.330 --> 03:29.110]  Like, what do you mean?
[03:29.630 --> 03:30.830]  I know what he means.
[03:31.030 --> 03:31.870]  I know what he means.
[03:31.870 --> 03:35.890]  He's never noticed a taste on anything on his body other than his tongue.
[03:36.010 --> 03:39.770]  Yeah, I'm never like lying down on a sun lounger and like...
[03:40.350 --> 03:45.510]  Or he never like spilled chocolate shake on his knee and went, oh, I can still taste it.
[03:48.530 --> 03:50.170]  Well, I'm not a scientist.
[03:50.510 --> 03:51.470]  I'm not a doctor.
[03:51.630 --> 03:52.930]  I don't know how these work.
[03:53.550 --> 03:55.290]  But I do know they're there.
[03:55.730 --> 04:01.230]  I do trust smarter, more generally educated and informed people about taste receptors
[04:01.230 --> 04:03.330]  are saying that there are taste receptors in your ass.
[04:03.890 --> 04:04.930]  And I will trust those people.
[04:05.210 --> 04:05.770]  I agree, dude.
[04:05.810 --> 04:07.210]  I think you can taste stuff with your butthole.
[04:07.550 --> 04:07.810]  Totally.
[04:07.910 --> 04:08.690]  Now, I don't...
[04:08.690 --> 04:14.090]  I believe every taste bud also has taste receptors, but not every taste receptor has a butt.
[04:14.390 --> 04:15.110]  It's how that works out.
[04:15.110 --> 04:19.310]  So the question is, will Geoff taste his milk icicle?
[04:19.710 --> 04:20.810]  That is a great question.
[04:20.890 --> 04:22.570]  Yeah, that is sort of what led into this.
[04:22.890 --> 04:24.230]  Hold on, Geoff, did you do your homework?
[04:24.390 --> 04:25.110]  We're getting off track.
[04:25.270 --> 04:28.630]  First off, hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face.
[04:28.630 --> 04:31.610]  I believe it is episode 72.
[04:32.830 --> 04:36.790]  My name is Geoff and with me as always, Andrew and Brick.
[04:36.950 --> 04:37.930]  How are you guys doing?
[04:38.250 --> 04:38.910]  I'm doing great.
[04:39.050 --> 04:42.050]  I feel like I've established some solid points in this episode.
[04:42.210 --> 04:43.330]  I think this one's going well for me.
[04:43.730 --> 04:44.270]  I like to start.
[04:44.310 --> 04:44.870]  I wonder...
[04:44.870 --> 04:48.830]  I mean, I get that a taste bud is...
[04:48.830 --> 04:50.690]  Oh, by the way, but you didn't say how you're doing, Brick.
[04:52.470 --> 04:53.270]  That's me, right?
[04:53.470 --> 04:53.630]  Yeah.
[04:53.730 --> 04:55.050]  That was what we determined last week.
[04:55.050 --> 04:55.990]  It's a triangle.
[04:57.490 --> 04:58.090]  I'll be honest.
[04:58.190 --> 05:02.210]  Last week, my internet was cutting out left and right and I can't remember a lot that happened.
[05:02.650 --> 05:06.670]  At one point, Andrew was about to say something funny and I didn't hear the end of it.
[05:07.010 --> 05:11.830]  And then when I heard the sound come back on, he was mad that neither of us reacted to it.
[05:12.350 --> 05:16.910]  So I was like, oh, I feel like I missed out on something there.
[05:16.950 --> 05:19.270]  I guess you haven't been able to listen to that episode yet either.
[05:19.470 --> 05:22.670]  I don't know if this was on, if we captured this on audio or not,
[05:22.670 --> 05:24.290]  but that episode stepped down.
[05:24.370 --> 05:26.410]  We stepped down from that episode and we were like,
[05:26.530 --> 05:28.390]  that was one of the better episodes we've done in a while.
[05:28.510 --> 05:30.110]  I felt really good about it. Really great.
[05:30.370 --> 05:32.670]  And you were like, I have no, I didn't hear any of it.
[05:32.750 --> 05:33.630]  I have no idea what happened.
[05:34.810 --> 05:40.410]  I heard the back half of a lot of sentences and I said a lot of stuff followed by silence.
[05:42.750 --> 05:44.210]  But who knows how it turned out?
[05:44.630 --> 05:48.690]  From what I remember, from what I did experience, I do remember it being quite a nice one.
[05:48.990 --> 05:50.590]  Yeah, it was a good, it was a goodie.
[05:50.610 --> 05:51.730]  That was a great pivot though, Geoff.
[05:51.730 --> 05:52.750]  Have you done your homework?
[05:52.950 --> 05:53.390]  What is, uh...
[05:53.390 --> 05:56.010]  Let's focus back on that. How's your homework doing? You do your homework?
[05:56.430 --> 06:00.570]  Oh yeah, I picked Tiffany. I think she's gonna win Survivor. Thanks for asking.
[06:00.890 --> 06:01.830]  Gavin, who did you pick?
[06:02.650 --> 06:03.450]  That was not the homework.
[06:03.630 --> 06:04.770]  I picked How It's Done.
[06:05.330 --> 06:06.730]  Right, right, right. You picked that guy.
[06:08.070 --> 06:09.370]  Anyway, what's new with you guys?
[06:09.990 --> 06:13.930]  What's new is I was just curious if you did the homework of trying the product that you've been
[06:13.930 --> 06:18.990]  trying to pitch for the last episode. 40 minutes of last episode. Any update on that?
[06:18.990 --> 06:22.890]  Uh, hold on a second. Let me think about this so I can remember what you're talking about.
[06:23.070 --> 06:25.150]  Uh, this is an old bit we did a while back?
[06:27.930 --> 06:29.430]  Oh, uh, I tried.
[06:29.630 --> 06:31.310]  The beef bracelet? Porta-Potty?
[06:31.690 --> 06:35.690]  Yep, sure. It was that one. It wasn't, it wasn't the one where you covered your ass
[06:35.690 --> 06:38.170]  in Tiger Balm and then was surprised.
[06:38.190 --> 06:40.890]  I feel like I can, I can smell Loya's coming on.
[06:40.930 --> 06:44.870]  The worst part is I don't even know if Gavin can back me up because he missed all of last episode.
[06:45.430 --> 06:48.570]  So I feel like this is really, I'm in a corner here.
[06:48.570 --> 06:52.010]  I'll be, I'll be honest. I don't, I don't remember what you're talking about,
[06:52.090 --> 06:56.130]  but that's not to say it didn't happen. Uh, was this something, was this pencil related?
[06:56.630 --> 07:00.330]  No, no, it was like the pencil equivalent of your asshole though.
[07:00.610 --> 07:01.550]  It looked like a pencil.
[07:02.250 --> 07:02.530]  Yeah.
[07:03.150 --> 07:08.330]  It was more like a blade, I would say. It's very sharp.
[07:09.150 --> 07:12.690]  You know, I'll be honest with you guys. I've been so busy doing other stuff,
[07:12.770 --> 07:17.690]  I didn't remember to stick a fucking, a joke popsicle up my asshole.
[07:18.190 --> 07:22.190]  Yeah, I just, it slipped my mind. I'm real sorry.
[07:22.430 --> 07:23.890]  That's the best place it could slip, probably.
[07:23.970 --> 07:29.150]  I'm real sorry, but I also, I gotta, I gotta be honest with you. At 46 years old,
[07:29.170 --> 07:35.570]  I don't know that my, that my prop icicle up my asshole covered in tiger balm days aren't behind me.
[07:37.690 --> 07:39.310]  It might be a younger man's game.
[07:40.390 --> 07:41.130]  It might be.
[07:41.310 --> 07:41.970]  I could see that.
[07:42.090 --> 07:45.310]  Well, what if we sub, what if we sub the pencil for the ice pick?
[07:45.550 --> 07:46.250]  I'll tell you what I did.
[07:46.250 --> 07:46.570]  For the icicle.
[07:46.570 --> 07:47.790]  I'll tell you what I did do.
[07:47.950 --> 07:48.330]  Okay.
[07:48.470 --> 07:51.030]  I scheduled a colonoscopy. That'll be way more invasive.
[07:51.370 --> 07:59.190]  Okay. I mean, what, so, is there, I've never had a colonoscopy. Is there pain afterward, I'd assume?
[08:00.270 --> 08:00.470]  Is it?
[08:00.730 --> 08:02.790]  No, not at all. You're asleep the whole time.
[08:03.650 --> 08:04.610]  But there's no, like, wake up.
[08:04.610 --> 08:05.050]  But it's more invasive.
[08:06.090 --> 08:07.710]  It is more invasive, but I was just curious.
[08:07.710 --> 08:10.130]  They snake a, they toilet snake a camera through you.
[08:10.710 --> 08:15.110]  I'm just, I was curious if you would need, like, some ice in the hole.
[08:15.110 --> 08:16.330]  If that would be good.
[08:16.410 --> 08:19.810]  If, like, if there's some swelling down there, it could be, like, a multi-use product.
[08:20.090 --> 08:22.390]  The problem with the colonoscopy is the prep.
[08:22.650 --> 08:24.910]  It's all the shit you gotta drink to clean yourself.
[08:24.930 --> 08:26.370]  And then all the shit you gotta shit.
[08:28.190 --> 08:31.510]  It's the, it's the, it's the, like, the 48 hours of shitting your brains out.
[08:31.570 --> 08:35.990]  And then, like, having to drink 18 gallons of this gross contact liquid.
[08:36.510 --> 08:39.850]  I'm just imagining a cut man with one of your, your popsicles
[08:39.850 --> 08:42.270]  as, like, a scenario in which that could be needed.
[08:42.410 --> 08:43.690]  How terrifying that'd be.
[08:44.370 --> 08:45.910]  He's got, like, the lube, the wraps.
[08:46.390 --> 08:47.490]  I'll be honest, I'll be honest.
[08:47.610 --> 08:50.530]  I was hoping, against hope, that you would forget.
[08:51.350 --> 08:51.770]  And then we would just move on.
[08:51.770 --> 08:53.930]  Oh no, that's not the only thing I haven't forgot about, Geoff.
[08:54.030 --> 08:56.390]  Geoff, how fast have you been able to throw a baseball?
[08:56.750 --> 08:58.410]  That was a few weeks ago at this point.
[08:58.490 --> 08:59.950]  What's your, what's your bottom number?
[09:00.330 --> 09:01.390]  Oh, we haven't done it yet.
[09:01.910 --> 09:02.650]  I saw the ball.
[09:03.790 --> 09:04.790]  Gavin's on the ball, though.
[09:06.130 --> 09:07.490]  Why haven't you thrown the ball yet?
[09:07.750 --> 09:11.130]  My favorite thing about the ball is that there's three digits on it.
[09:11.130 --> 09:13.810]  Like, who's throwing 100 miles an hour, that thing?
[09:14.930 --> 09:15.650]  I don't know.
[09:15.910 --> 09:16.790]  It goes up to 120.
[09:17.230 --> 09:17.830]  So, you know.
[09:18.550 --> 09:18.910]  120?!
[09:18.910 --> 09:20.350]  They wouldn't put it there if there wasn't a need.
[09:22.770 --> 09:24.710]  Uh, I'm all about throwing the ball.
[09:24.890 --> 09:26.230]  I don't know, because it hasn't been...
[09:26.230 --> 09:27.790]  I feel like, at this point, it's a thing.
[09:27.810 --> 09:29.390]  If we're gonna do it, there's gotta be...
[09:29.390 --> 09:30.370]  We've gotta film it, right?
[09:31.230 --> 09:31.950]  No, well...
[09:31.950 --> 09:32.790]  Yeah, film it now.
[09:33.350 --> 09:33.990]  Yeah, I don't...
[09:33.990 --> 09:34.770]  I can't...
[09:34.770 --> 09:35.490]  You just...
[09:35.490 --> 09:36.590]  It doesn't need to be a thing.
[09:36.630 --> 09:37.710]  You setting the low bar.
[09:37.830 --> 09:40.310]  The thing is three months from when you throw it.
[09:40.310 --> 09:41.190]  That's the thing.
[09:41.370 --> 09:42.390]  Trying to hit the number.
[09:42.730 --> 09:44.110]  Did we determine it was three months?
[09:44.510 --> 09:44.850]  Yes.
[09:45.310 --> 09:45.990]  Yes, we did.
[09:46.730 --> 09:50.130]  From the point of you throwing, you have three months to prepare for the second throw.
[09:50.130 --> 09:50.870]  When did we...
[09:50.870 --> 09:51.770]  Three months seemed...
[09:51.770 --> 09:52.990]  When did we land on three months?
[09:53.430 --> 09:55.230]  You said it in an episode.
[09:55.710 --> 09:56.830]  Like, three episodes ago.
[09:56.950 --> 09:57.950]  Or whenever we brought it up.
[09:58.010 --> 10:00.270]  You're like, I'll throw it, and then in three months...
[10:00.270 --> 10:01.410]  I said... I probably...
[10:01.410 --> 10:02.570]  I doubt I was that definitive.
[10:02.730 --> 10:04.550]  I was probably like, in a few months, three or six.
[10:04.890 --> 10:06.810]  Because I feel like six is probably closer to what...
[10:06.810 --> 10:07.490]  But I don't know!
[10:07.550 --> 10:08.350]  We don't know, because I will see...
[10:08.350 --> 10:08.990]  You said three!
[10:09.250 --> 10:10.050]  It depends...
[10:10.050 --> 10:13.790]  Hold on. Two episodes ago, you said about six months, I think, is what Nick said.
[10:13.890 --> 10:14.450]  Okay, that's fair.
[10:15.390 --> 10:16.390]  He typoed that.
[10:16.990 --> 10:17.950]  Oh, yeah, six months.
[10:18.210 --> 10:20.370]  He didn't typo it. You misread his three as a six.
[10:20.390 --> 10:24.110]  Two episodes ago, you said about six months, I think.
[10:24.250 --> 10:25.130]  Then Eric said six months.
[10:25.270 --> 10:26.450]  Then Nick said six.
[10:26.610 --> 10:27.730]  And then he said it in Spanish.
[10:27.850 --> 10:28.330]  He said...
[10:28.330 --> 10:29.770]  Hey guys, what's up? Producer Eric here.
[10:29.810 --> 10:30.230]  How's it going?
[10:31.050 --> 10:35.230]  So, just wanted to step in and get a definitive call on this.
[10:35.630 --> 10:38.010]  Geoff said that he would need three months to train
[10:38.010 --> 10:40.290]  from the first throw of the baseball.
[10:40.590 --> 10:44.030]  So he was going to throw the baseball, get a baseline for how fast he could throw,
[10:44.150 --> 10:48.430]  and then with his shoulder that I think is the one with arthritis,
[10:48.430 --> 10:55.090]  he's going to throw 80 miles an hour just after he has set his initial baseline.
[10:55.310 --> 10:58.150]  He said he needed three months to train, and then at that point,
[10:58.410 --> 11:00.650]  what we're going to do is film it in slow motion,
[11:00.790 --> 11:03.030]  get an umpire, a catcher, and a guy with a radar gun.
[11:03.110 --> 11:06.630]  We're going to go out to a field, and Geoff is going to throw a baseball,
[11:07.590 --> 11:09.110]  probably 72 miles an hour.
[11:09.470 --> 11:12.750]  Well, that would be eight miles under what I need.
[11:13.090 --> 11:16.330]  I like the idea that you think you just need three more months to do it.
[11:16.970 --> 11:18.690]  That's what I appreciate about you right now.
[11:18.850 --> 11:20.370]  It'll be like three months a little tight,
[11:20.470 --> 11:22.510]  but six months, I can definitely do in six months.
[11:22.530 --> 11:25.250]  Three months from when I throw the first baseball.
[11:26.250 --> 11:28.890]  I'm saying, I don't think we could give you six years.
[11:29.050 --> 11:30.030]  I don't think it makes a difference.
[11:32.350 --> 11:34.110]  It'll definitely happen in six years.
[11:35.050 --> 11:36.810]  Why don't we do a tiered system then?
[11:36.910 --> 11:39.730]  If you get first prize if you do it in three months,
[11:39.850 --> 11:42.250]  and if it's within six years, you get like bronze.
[11:42.930 --> 11:43.570]  We don't need that.
[11:43.710 --> 11:45.410]  We'll do three months, and that's what it is.
[11:45.730 --> 11:47.390]  We'll throw the baseball soon.
[11:47.770 --> 11:50.450]  We have to figure out how to set the distance or whatever on it.
[11:50.490 --> 11:51.710]  We'll throw the little baseball soon.
[11:51.850 --> 11:52.730]  We'll film that.
[11:52.870 --> 11:55.950]  We'll get it officially recorded, and then we'll go from there.
[11:56.370 --> 11:56.650]  Okay.
[11:57.010 --> 12:00.030]  But I'm not the producer of the show, so I can, you know...
[12:00.030 --> 12:01.350]  Well, you're the one with the baseball.
[12:01.850 --> 12:04.630]  I feel like you have agency over what it's thrown.
[12:05.590 --> 12:06.710]  You have all the pieces.
[12:08.070 --> 12:11.650]  I don't know what the producer has to do with it.
[12:11.650 --> 12:12.990]  It's literally, you just need an iPhone.
[12:13.750 --> 12:15.710]  You throw a ball against the wall, see it's like 40.
[12:15.710 --> 12:17.430]  You know what I'm hearing?
[12:17.670 --> 12:19.250]  I'm hearing you produce this bit.
[12:19.370 --> 12:20.010]  That's awesome, dude.
[12:20.250 --> 12:21.310]  What a producer would do.
[12:21.470 --> 12:22.030]  Great job.
[12:22.350 --> 12:23.070]  I'm not producing.
[12:23.230 --> 12:25.790]  I'm just telling you how to do this very simple thing that you're avoiding.
[12:25.890 --> 12:26.390]  Because you're scared.
[12:26.490 --> 12:28.130]  That is what a producer did.
[12:28.410 --> 12:28.890]  You realize...
[12:28.890 --> 12:28.930]  I'm not scared.
[12:29.650 --> 12:30.330]  Oh, no, no, no.
[12:30.330 --> 12:31.810]  I'm not scared at all.
[12:31.910 --> 12:33.390]  I think 80 is highly doable.
[12:33.550 --> 12:37.610]  And I have every confidence that I can throw this ball 80 miles an hour.
[12:37.810 --> 12:39.070]  Don't, you don't have to worry about it.
[12:39.250 --> 12:42.530]  Do you need help setting the distance and filming it, Geoff?
[12:43.650 --> 12:43.990]  Yeah.
[12:44.970 --> 12:46.370]  I don't think you need slow motion.
[12:46.450 --> 12:47.170]  Here's what I need.
[12:47.690 --> 12:51.150]  I need somebody else in f*** face to lift a finger to help me.
[12:51.790 --> 12:53.270]  Well, I've lifted fingers before.
[12:54.630 --> 12:56.370]  And I've appreciated it.
[12:56.370 --> 12:56.930]  I can do it again.
[12:57.030 --> 12:57.730]  I really appreciate it.
[12:57.730 --> 12:59.410]  I really appreciated that time you did it.
[12:59.410 --> 13:01.310]  You needed help initially throwing the ball.
[13:01.430 --> 13:03.070]  You said you were just going to throw the ball.
[13:03.290 --> 13:04.490]  I didn't know that you needed...
[13:04.490 --> 13:06.890]  If I would have known that, we would have already gotten this going.
[13:07.350 --> 13:08.350]  Yeah, let's do it, man.
[13:08.850 --> 13:10.830]  I thought this was all hinging on you throwing the ball.
[13:11.510 --> 13:11.770]  Yes.
[13:11.850 --> 13:14.490]  I gotta throw the ball to set the base time.
[13:14.910 --> 13:15.110]  Right.
[13:15.310 --> 13:16.990]  I didn't know you needed help with that.
[13:17.290 --> 13:19.070]  Well, I figure I didn't initially.
[13:19.190 --> 13:21.550]  But now that it's become a thing, if it's going to end up on YouTube,
[13:21.810 --> 13:24.070]  if it's going to be a whole deal, then I think it should be treated.
[13:24.090 --> 13:25.150]  It was always a thing.
[13:25.230 --> 13:26.830]  But the thing was the second part.
[13:26.950 --> 13:28.410]  The first part was never the thing.
[13:28.410 --> 13:30.850]  The thing is you try to actually set 80.
[13:31.290 --> 13:33.430]  Because we all agree you're not just going to throw 80.
[13:34.150 --> 13:37.730]  What kind of video do you have where we don't see the first part
[13:37.730 --> 13:39.230]  and then you just see me throw it 80 miles an hour?
[13:40.550 --> 13:43.430]  We have a video that's not going to exist.
[13:44.750 --> 13:48.650]  You need a video of me throwing it in the high 50s, early 60s.
[13:48.690 --> 13:51.830]  And then you need a video of me throwing it 81, 82, like Michael Johnson.
[13:51.890 --> 13:54.550]  I just love the idea of trying to sell this YouTube channel.
[13:54.670 --> 13:57.110]  We have videos such as Geoff rides a bike.
[13:57.750 --> 13:59.170]  Geoff throws a bull.
[13:59.450 --> 14:01.070]  It's really top notch stuff.
[14:01.190 --> 14:03.210]  You and you ride a jet ski.
[14:05.130 --> 14:08.330]  You think that you're going to top out in your first throw.
[14:08.510 --> 14:11.090]  You think you're going to throw 58 miles an hour.
[14:11.290 --> 14:15.730]  And then in three months, you're going to throw 80 miles an hour.
[14:16.210 --> 14:17.430]  Why don't you just said?
[14:17.890 --> 14:21.790]  I think my first throw after not throwing a baseball for however many years
[14:21.790 --> 14:25.150]  will probably probably not be representative of what I could do
[14:25.150 --> 14:26.850]  with even three or four days of training.
[14:27.250 --> 14:29.450]  Have you thrown the ball at all?
[14:29.630 --> 14:30.770]  No, any for us?
[14:31.190 --> 14:33.670]  No, I don't understand.
[14:33.690 --> 14:37.670]  I think it needs help with the measurement because you need to set a distance.
[14:37.830 --> 14:42.290]  And I assume it calculates from when it goes from zero G to when it feels an impact.
[14:42.430 --> 14:45.150]  So if it doesn't know the set distance, it doesn't know the speed.
[14:46.370 --> 14:47.370]  Yeah, he's got a point.
[14:47.710 --> 14:48.590]  It's a lot of math involved.
[14:48.770 --> 14:49.870]  I think it's just maths.
[14:50.010 --> 14:50.930]  It's a maths ball.
[14:52.190 --> 14:53.350]  Yeah, I don't.
[14:53.350 --> 14:55.790]  Okay, we should throw a baseball.
[14:56.110 --> 14:58.890]  So we get a base number and you can begin your training.
[14:58.930 --> 15:00.570]  I'm very excited to see you train.
[15:00.810 --> 15:03.650]  60 feet is how far it needs to go.
[15:03.770 --> 15:04.790]  It's very specific.
[15:05.050 --> 15:07.270]  I have my burger confidence.
[15:07.410 --> 15:09.530]  I'm irrationally confident about burgers.
[15:09.870 --> 15:13.230]  Historically, Geoff is absurd with his baseball throwing speed.
[15:13.350 --> 15:14.250]  He's got baseball confidence.
[15:14.570 --> 15:16.350]  I'm curious what your confidence is, Gavin.
[15:16.650 --> 15:17.970]  We haven't encountered it yet.
[15:18.090 --> 15:22.110]  I don't think like what is the thing that you irrationally believe in yourself being able to do?
[15:22.210 --> 15:22.970]  That's interesting.
[15:23.870 --> 15:25.170]  Have you ever had one?
[15:25.530 --> 15:26.830]  I think I'm yet to find my confidence.
[15:27.910 --> 15:31.070]  Like just in general or within a bit for this?
[15:31.730 --> 15:35.350]  There has had to have been a time where you're like, I can do this if you're way up.
[15:36.290 --> 15:37.270]  A little bit of both.
[15:39.070 --> 15:40.770]  I feel like Geoff knows something I don't.
[15:41.630 --> 15:44.170]  I'm just laughing and I've yet to find my confidence.
[15:44.890 --> 15:46.210]  I'm gonna do the 30s.
[15:50.270 --> 15:51.190]  I'm trying to think.
[15:51.190 --> 15:54.290]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think I've ever been as confident, Andrew,
[15:54.410 --> 15:56.630]  as you were that you could eat burgers.
[15:56.730 --> 16:00.990]  But also that resulted in nothing for you because you've still never done that or come close.
[16:02.290 --> 16:03.270]  I've come close.
[16:03.590 --> 16:04.490]  I reject that.
[16:04.650 --> 16:06.890]  The second time I did it, I ate like 42 of them.
[16:07.390 --> 16:08.090]  I got close.
[16:08.650 --> 16:12.570]  I thought the second time you did it, you ordered the wrong ones and then stopped halfway through.
[16:13.170 --> 16:15.370]  No, that was the third attempt.
[16:15.770 --> 16:17.910]  Yeah, that was try number three.
[16:19.090 --> 16:25.630]  Look, if you were 42 in away from 50, that's way closer than 58 miles an hour to 80.
[16:25.830 --> 16:31.070]  So I would say you're closer to your burger victory than Geoff is his baseball victory.
[16:32.310 --> 16:33.710]  That's a fantastic point.
[16:33.870 --> 16:34.270]  Do you think?
[16:34.550 --> 16:35.930]  And I didn't do any training for mine.
[16:36.350 --> 16:37.190]  You just showed up.
[16:37.190 --> 16:37.710]  I don't know about that.
[16:37.770 --> 16:38.970]  You train every day.
[16:39.630 --> 16:40.070]  No.
[16:40.410 --> 16:42.290]  You train three times a day, motherfucker.
[16:43.070 --> 16:47.730]  That's like if you showed up to a marathon and did no running and was like,
[16:47.730 --> 16:49.050]  I walk every day.
[16:49.130 --> 16:49.530]  I've been training.
[16:49.810 --> 16:52.290]  If it's a walking marathon, then you're training every day.
[16:52.390 --> 16:53.590]  No, it's not training.
[16:53.850 --> 16:57.770]  Just because you go to an eating competition and you eat every day, that's training.
[16:58.370 --> 16:59.130]  It's not training.
[16:59.210 --> 16:59.790]  It is training.
[17:00.650 --> 17:01.330]  That's not...
[17:01.330 --> 17:01.930]  No.
[17:02.250 --> 17:02.970]  I reject this.
[17:03.950 --> 17:04.250]  It's a ridiculous comparison.
[17:04.250 --> 17:07.310]  Are you saying by eating one burger a day, you're training?
[17:07.310 --> 17:09.390]  If I was eating a burger a day, that might be training.
[17:09.970 --> 17:11.450]  I could maybe see that point.
[17:11.570 --> 17:14.290]  That's such a specific food and I'm eating burgers.
[17:14.870 --> 17:16.510]  Just general eating isn't training.
[17:19.960 --> 17:22.960]  I'm not fucking eating popcorn at the movie theater being like,
[17:23.040 --> 17:23.440]  I'm training.
[17:23.620 --> 17:24.000]  I'm working.
[17:24.120 --> 17:25.320]  I'm putting in the extra time.
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.880]  I'm getting a refill like I'm in the gym right now.
[17:28.040 --> 17:29.000]  What if you ate it really fast?
[17:29.120 --> 17:29.440]  You're training.
[17:29.860 --> 17:31.800]  Speed has nothing to do with it.
[17:31.840 --> 17:33.080]  It's a different texture.
[17:33.340 --> 17:34.820]  First of all, it's like a different climate.
[17:35.200 --> 17:36.060]  You were saying speed.
[17:36.240 --> 17:38.560]  If you ate it fast enough, your body wouldn't realize it's full.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.540]  Yeah, but it's not...
[17:39.540 --> 17:43.720]  It's like if you're playing tennis and you're fucking playing on clay courts,
[17:43.940 --> 17:46.720]  it's not going to be the same when you're playing on different courts.
[17:46.840 --> 17:47.940]  I love the all of your allergies.
[17:47.940 --> 17:49.740]  But you're still playing tennis.
[17:49.940 --> 17:51.560]  You're still training at tennis.
[17:51.780 --> 17:53.960]  All of your analogies involve tennis.
[17:54.520 --> 17:55.280]  What do you mean?
[17:55.540 --> 17:56.460]  The second one in two weeks.
[17:56.960 --> 17:58.200]  What was my other tennis night?
[17:58.420 --> 18:00.160]  You were like, you were like writing a letter.
[18:00.360 --> 18:03.880]  It's like if every tennis hit was a different game or something.
[18:04.580 --> 18:05.860]  What is it with you and tennis?
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.400]  I don't remember the other one.
[18:09.800 --> 18:12.640]  Let me tell you about a drill we used to do on the sewing machine
[18:12.640 --> 18:13.840]  back when I played tennis.
[18:14.800 --> 18:17.560]  You like tennis almost as much as you like honeymoon.
[18:17.560 --> 18:18.600]  Not even close.
[18:18.700 --> 18:19.940]  I'm pretty indifferent to tennis.
[18:20.060 --> 18:22.800]  Tennis is a great if it's on, I'll watch it type sport.
[18:22.960 --> 18:24.540]  It's fun, but I'm never chasing.
[18:24.780 --> 18:27.100]  I'm just relating it to how many times you brought it up without.
[18:27.520 --> 18:28.940]  OK, let me think of a different.
[18:29.140 --> 18:31.400]  What's what's an analogy where you're doing something?
[18:32.620 --> 18:35.480]  Is is walking training for swimming?
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.120]  Those aren't the same things.
[18:37.120 --> 18:38.300]  You're moving your legs in both.
[18:40.260 --> 18:41.820]  Jesus, you can't apply.
[18:42.080 --> 18:43.320]  Those two things is the same.
[18:43.500 --> 18:44.220]  Those are different things.
[18:44.260 --> 18:44.860]  You lost me there.
[18:45.080 --> 18:46.740]  No, but I would say that.
[18:46.740 --> 18:48.320]  Well, you got to kick your legs.
[18:48.420 --> 18:49.340]  I would say that there are strokes.
[18:49.700 --> 18:52.900]  I would say dog paddling in a pool is probably training for swimming.
[18:53.420 --> 18:55.280]  Yeah, but that's that's swimming.
[18:55.660 --> 18:57.420]  Yeah, so eating, eating is eating.
[18:58.360 --> 19:02.340]  No, but it's because the part of ingesting food,
[19:02.520 --> 19:05.280]  the part of your mouth down your throat and into your stomach.
[19:05.480 --> 19:07.420]  It's not the function of eating.
[19:07.820 --> 19:10.660]  Competitive eating isn't training for the function of eating.
[19:10.700 --> 19:12.540]  It's the storage of the food.
[19:12.960 --> 19:14.360]  That is what you train for.
[19:14.360 --> 19:15.720]  Also, like jaw things.
[19:15.860 --> 19:17.800]  I guess that is technically more like the chewing.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.160]  You got to build up your muscles.
[19:19.500 --> 19:20.700]  You got to get your strength.
[19:20.900 --> 19:23.760]  The majority of your chewing technique.
[19:24.180 --> 19:25.220]  I'm sure it's all about that.
[19:25.320 --> 19:26.660]  There's no chewing technique.
[19:26.660 --> 19:29.320]  Everybody's probably got their own like, like chew, chew, chew, chew.
[19:29.520 --> 19:33.000]  Or like some people are probably like chew, chew, chew, chew, chew, chew, chew.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.320]  You don't know.
[19:34.520 --> 19:35.280]  No, you're not a professional.
[19:35.280 --> 19:35.620]  I do.
[19:36.340 --> 19:36.940]  I'm not.
[19:37.040 --> 19:40.900]  But I did research one night before I was going to do the thing.
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.660]  And it sounds like, from my understanding, it's about just creating space in your stomach,
[19:46.820 --> 19:50.720]  essentially like stretching your stomach out, getting it comfortable with expanding it.
[19:50.940 --> 19:53.920]  So you can store more than the base stomach.
[19:54.500 --> 19:55.120]  That's where the training.
[19:55.140 --> 19:58.880]  You told us that it was you were training your brain to eat quickly
[19:58.880 --> 20:02.320]  because you'd be further along before your brain caught up or some shit.
[20:02.440 --> 20:03.720]  You had all kinds of...
[20:03.720 --> 20:06.720]  No, I was just trying to go fast because I figured if I ate as much as possible,
[20:06.820 --> 20:10.180]  my brain wouldn't know what was happening until I got further along.
[20:10.180 --> 20:11.600]  And it worked on the second one.
[20:11.620 --> 20:14.420]  I feel like, as you know, Andrew, it's your redemption year.
[20:14.580 --> 20:16.080]  I feel like maybe a fourth attempt...
[20:16.080 --> 20:16.380]  It is.
[20:16.680 --> 20:17.380]  ...might be on the cards.
[20:18.180 --> 20:20.920]  No, here's the thing about the burgers.
[20:21.140 --> 20:22.980]  When you do the burgers, it takes a lot out of you.
[20:23.280 --> 20:26.360]  You lose a part of your soul every time you go into that McDonald's bag.
[20:26.380 --> 20:28.280]  So you've lost three chunks of soul?
[20:29.480 --> 20:31.660]  I've lost more than three chunks.
[20:32.680 --> 20:33.800]  Do you know what you haven't had to do?
[20:34.040 --> 20:36.060]  Stick a milk popsicle up your asshole.
[20:36.320 --> 20:37.720]  Talk about losing a piece of your soul.
[20:37.920 --> 20:39.400]  I'm going to stab my soul.
[20:39.400 --> 20:40.080]  That's what I was saying.
[20:40.160 --> 20:43.820]  I think we could potentially write off the entire pencil punishment
[20:43.820 --> 20:47.200]  and just have Andrew do the milk popsicle.
[20:47.540 --> 20:47.940]  Oh.
[20:48.060 --> 20:49.960]  No, I'm not the one selling it.
[20:50.040 --> 20:51.240]  That was my issue with Geoff,
[20:51.300 --> 20:53.520]  is that he spent 40 minutes talking about how great it is.
[20:53.580 --> 20:56.320]  Yeah, but you can effectively erase a debt here.
[20:56.600 --> 20:57.800]  And it is the redemption year.
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.060]  I'm going to erase a debt by doing Geoff's debt in a bet that I lost to you.
[21:02.380 --> 21:03.020]  Is that what you're saying?
[21:03.360 --> 21:04.460]  Is that how that works?
[21:05.540 --> 21:08.780]  I owe the pencil because of a bet I lost to you.
[21:08.780 --> 21:10.920]  You owe the audience the pencil.
[21:11.120 --> 21:12.480]  No, I owe you the pencil.
[21:12.860 --> 21:14.480]  The audience is just demanding it.
[21:14.660 --> 21:15.900]  But I owe you the pencil.
[21:16.060 --> 21:19.620]  The comment leavers have failed to stop leaving comments about the pencil, Andrew.
[21:19.840 --> 21:22.220]  I haven't made a bet with the comment leavers.
[21:22.340 --> 21:24.700]  I made a bet with you and I lost that bet.
[21:25.340 --> 21:26.400]  Can I just say...
[21:27.340 --> 21:28.960]  It doesn't matter who's in front.
[21:29.360 --> 21:29.780]  What's that, Geoff?
[21:30.700 --> 21:32.260]  Just a little aside,
[21:32.360 --> 21:34.840]  because this goes into something that I wanted to talk about briefly anyway.
[21:35.500 --> 21:38.140]  There was a thread on Reddit.
[21:38.140 --> 21:41.960]  I don't know if either of you or if any of you saw it recently.
[21:42.320 --> 21:46.440]  It was somebody got the Billy Ripken f*** face card and posted it.
[21:46.520 --> 21:48.800]  And then there was like hundreds of people in the comments.
[21:48.920 --> 21:53.720]  But the top comment on the Billy Ripken, just in baseball cards or whatever thread,
[21:53.800 --> 21:54.800]  is eat the pencil, Andrew.
[21:56.680 --> 22:01.380]  It is the top f***ing comment on some other subreddit about that baseball card.
[22:01.540 --> 22:04.480]  And then there's about 500 other f*** face comments,
[22:04.480 --> 22:09.560]  which is awesome to go to some other corner of the internet and find f*** facers,
[22:09.940 --> 22:11.220]  comment leavers going nuts.
[22:11.420 --> 22:14.580]  But it is literally, eat the pencil, Andrew, is the number one comment,
[22:14.660 --> 22:15.820]  which I just find to be very funny.
[22:15.900 --> 22:20.800]  I mean, what more of a perfect end to your redemption year, Andrew, than to eat the pencil?
[22:22.180 --> 22:23.960]  But you're not pitching that.
[22:25.760 --> 22:30.200]  You're saying, what more than a perfect end to your redemption year
[22:30.200 --> 22:33.100]  than you not eating the thing people are demanding
[22:33.100 --> 22:36.200]  and instead do a thing that Geoff said he would do?
[22:36.760 --> 22:37.720]  I'll be right back.
[22:37.760 --> 22:38.920]  It makes no sense, Gavin.
[22:39.920 --> 22:44.200]  I just want your redemption year to be as whole as possible.
[22:44.540 --> 22:46.180]  And I feel like you're off to a good start,
[22:46.360 --> 22:48.600]  but you haven't redeemed yourself in like two months.
[22:48.860 --> 22:52.700]  I want it to be as whole as it can while avoiding certain holes.
[22:53.220 --> 22:58.600]  I will cover upper holes I'm okay with to make it whole.
[22:58.780 --> 22:59.960]  Lower holes, not...
[22:59.960 --> 23:01.180]  What if I...
[23:01.180 --> 23:01.960]  Because here's the thing.
[23:01.960 --> 23:04.340]  Yeah, you got taste receptors in your mouth.
[23:04.480 --> 23:05.000]  Yeah, that's true.
[23:05.300 --> 23:08.480]  Could I just try? Could I do the same test with the mouth?
[23:08.900 --> 23:09.420]  What test?
[23:09.540 --> 23:11.000]  I need to look into Tiger Balm.
[23:11.160 --> 23:11.420]  Oh.
[23:12.520 --> 23:15.940]  To test the efficiency, because that's really where this comes down to.
[23:16.140 --> 23:17.500]  It's an efficiency test.
[23:17.580 --> 23:19.580]  Of how quickly you can remove the spice.
[23:19.980 --> 23:20.740]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:20.880 --> 23:23.160]  Like, I don't think we know if milk actually counters
[23:23.160 --> 23:26.140]  the spice of a Tiger Balm ointment at all.
[23:26.300 --> 23:27.960]  I think that was the basis of...
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.660]  We're thinking that it's only the peppers, the hot peppers.
[23:31.660 --> 23:33.120]  Yeah, the uh...
[23:33.120 --> 23:34.600]  Oh, what's it called? The uh...
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.500]  Fucking shit. I'm not gonna remember it.
[23:36.780 --> 23:37.220]  The jalapenos.
[23:37.900 --> 23:38.760]  I don't know why I'm still trying.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.940]  No, not that. There's a word for it.
[23:40.960 --> 23:43.700]  There's a specific spice word people are like,
[23:43.760 --> 23:45.320]  Oh, it has this many of those.
[23:45.700 --> 23:46.960]  Oh, your Scoville?
[23:47.200 --> 23:48.080]  Yeah, the Scoville.
[23:48.580 --> 23:49.100]  Capsaicin a lot?
[23:49.100 --> 23:49.980]  That's what I was thinking of.
[23:50.160 --> 23:50.960]  So where did you go, Geoff?
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.060]  Here's what I've done.
[23:52.940 --> 23:53.980]  Because I don't want to...
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.800]  Well, first off, I got to thinking about it.
[23:56.300 --> 23:58.340]  I don't want to rile the comment leavers up,
[23:58.360 --> 23:59.000]  because they get...
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.020]  You start talking pencils,
[24:00.020 --> 24:01.840]  and they get whipped up into a frenzy.
[24:02.320 --> 24:05.380]  And it's the same thing with the port-a-potties or the sauces.
[24:05.580 --> 24:08.220]  I don't want to turn this into a whole other sauce thing.
[24:08.540 --> 24:11.820]  So while you guys were arguing about capsaicin or whatever,
[24:12.440 --> 24:14.340]  I went ahead and just said,
[24:14.400 --> 24:15.060]  We'll see what happens.
[24:15.480 --> 24:19.560]  I went and I cracked open a new container of Tiger Balm Ultra,
[24:19.860 --> 24:21.800]  and I put just the tiniest bit of my butthole.
[24:22.020 --> 24:24.100]  So I'm just gonna sit here and I'm gonna deal with that.
[24:24.180 --> 24:25.200]  What is wrong with you?
[24:25.560 --> 24:26.840]  I'm gonna deal with that while we're sitting here,
[24:26.920 --> 24:29.200]  and if it's bad enough, I may not have a choice.
[24:30.020 --> 24:30.420]  What?
[24:31.900 --> 24:34.100]  He won't film himself throw a baseball,
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.100]  but he'll just put Tiger Balm in his ass on an audio podcast.
[24:38.500 --> 24:42.960]  Yeah, I mean, I put Tiger Balm on my balls on Achievement Hunter video once.
[24:43.140 --> 24:44.740]  It's like, that part's easy.
[24:45.840 --> 24:49.600]  The hard part to me is to mentally, you know,
[24:49.720 --> 24:51.400]  get there to put that thing in my butthole.
[24:51.500 --> 24:53.640]  But if I'm in such excruciating pain...
[24:53.640 --> 24:55.620]  Is that wise right before a colonoscopy?
[24:56.200 --> 24:57.320]  That's a couple months ago.
[24:57.980 --> 24:58.820]  I just scheduled it.
[24:58.820 --> 25:01.460]  Do you have a No Spicy Icy?
[25:01.600 --> 25:02.840]  Is that what it was called?
[25:02.960 --> 25:03.960]  Do you have one on hand?
[25:04.360 --> 25:04.720]  The No Spicy?
[25:04.880 --> 25:05.560]  Yeah, I got the original.
[25:05.720 --> 25:06.120]  I got the prototype.
[25:06.760 --> 25:07.080]  What do you mean?
[25:07.100 --> 25:08.240]  You still have the original?
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.660]  It's been in my freezer this whole time.
[25:10.620 --> 25:12.800]  That makes it so much worse for whatever reason.
[25:12.820 --> 25:13.880]  Well, it's like two weeks old.
[25:14.760 --> 25:16.320]  Yeah, the older it gets, like,
[25:16.360 --> 25:17.860]  you hear that it's just a frozen product.
[25:18.120 --> 25:18.740]  I don't...
[25:18.960 --> 25:20.540]  Did I tell you what my asshole doesn't have?
[25:20.760 --> 25:21.460]  Taste buds.
[25:21.640 --> 25:23.460]  The taste receptors in my butthole aren't gonna care.
[25:24.160 --> 25:24.740]  That's true.
[25:25.080 --> 25:25.560]  That's fair.
[25:25.760 --> 25:26.000]  Okay.
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.080]  It's a wild move by you.
[25:28.080 --> 25:29.260]  Nick has a good point here.
[25:29.380 --> 25:32.200]  He says, uh, hopefully it's not Freezer Bird.
[25:32.480 --> 25:33.460]  Yeah, I'm sure it is.
[25:34.760 --> 25:36.660]  I'm also not sure it's going anywhere near me.
[25:36.740 --> 25:38.180]  We're just gonna see how bad this...
[25:38.180 --> 25:40.000]  And I'll be honest with you, it's getting.
[25:40.440 --> 25:40.980]  It's getting.
[25:41.400 --> 25:41.940]  It's getting.
[25:42.120 --> 25:42.420]  It's getting.
[25:42.720 --> 25:43.120]  It's...
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.520]  So where would you rate the uncomfortable...
[25:48.480 --> 25:51.140]  How uncomfortable is it currently between 1 and 10?
[25:53.020 --> 25:54.560]  It sounds like it got in his mouth.
[25:54.560 --> 25:54.880]  It's my...
[25:58.940 --> 25:59.940]  It's a...
[25:59.940 --> 26:01.900]  How close is your mouth to your asshole?
[26:02.200 --> 26:02.340]  What?
[26:03.780 --> 26:04.780]  It's not...
[26:04.780 --> 26:05.120]  It's...
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.420]  It's making me cough for some reason and it's...
[26:07.420 --> 26:08.140]  I'm sweating.
[26:08.500 --> 26:10.000]  I'm sweating like it's...
[26:10.000 --> 26:10.700]  Like I'm outside.
[26:11.020 --> 26:11.460]  It's like a...
[26:11.460 --> 26:12.340]  Oh my god.
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.680]  What does it taste like, Geoff?
[26:20.340 --> 26:21.400]  It's not good.
[26:21.400 --> 26:21.920]  What?
[26:23.180 --> 26:26.200]  This is the new drinking from a can without burping.
[26:26.360 --> 26:27.780]  He's gonna do this every week.
[26:29.360 --> 26:30.160]  No, I'm not.
[26:30.240 --> 26:31.120]  I'm not doing this again.
[26:32.280 --> 26:33.560]  I'm not doing this again.
[26:34.040 --> 26:35.340]  I don't know why it made me cough.
[26:35.460 --> 26:36.580]  But it also cleared my nose out.
[26:37.320 --> 26:38.840]  You can clear your nose out through your asshole.
[26:39.000 --> 26:39.900]  It's like Vicks Vaporub.
[26:39.900 --> 26:40.880]  Do a Tiger Bomb in it.
[26:41.760 --> 26:43.840]  It goes all the way straight into you.
[26:46.860 --> 26:47.660]  I don't...
[26:47.660 --> 26:49.380]  I don't know why you did this.
[26:50.100 --> 26:53.220]  I don't know why you're willing to do this, but you won't throw a baseball.
[26:53.540 --> 26:56.000]  I wanted to calm the Pencil Beast.
[26:56.320 --> 26:56.980]  That's all.
[26:57.840 --> 26:58.240]  Okay.
[26:59.360 --> 27:00.320]  I respect that.
[27:00.560 --> 27:01.120]  But it's just...
[27:01.120 --> 27:02.320]  It seems, you know...
[27:02.320 --> 27:04.700]  It was... I did it out of abundance of love for you, Andrew.
[27:05.180 --> 27:05.580]  You did.
[27:05.660 --> 27:06.240]  That was a nice move.
[27:06.240 --> 27:06.900]  You jumped on the grenade.
[27:07.180 --> 27:08.160]  You jumped on the pencil grenade.
[27:08.440 --> 27:08.920]  It was.
[27:09.260 --> 27:11.280]  It was very considerate of you, Geoff.
[27:11.400 --> 27:12.580]  I appreciate your suffering.
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.800]  Geoff put his anus over the pencil grenade.
[27:17.120 --> 27:18.600]  I don't know why it's making me cough.
[27:18.620 --> 27:19.260]  How did you apply it to your...
[27:19.380 --> 27:20.660]  Your anus? With your finger?
[27:21.240 --> 27:22.160]  That I cleaned after.
[27:22.380 --> 27:22.600]  Yes.
[27:24.660 --> 27:25.680]  I washed my hands.
[27:27.400 --> 27:29.520]  I can't tell if I'm cheating right now or not.
[27:29.660 --> 27:31.660]  You did it quite early in the podcast.
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.140]  We still got like half of it left.
[27:35.060 --> 27:35.360]  Yeah.
[27:35.640 --> 27:36.600]  Well, I figured that...
[27:36.600 --> 27:37.260]  We'll see.
[27:38.600 --> 27:42.120]  Andrew usually suddenly does something right at the end, but...
[27:42.120 --> 27:43.340]  Not usually in the first half.
[27:43.440 --> 27:44.660]  Well, see, if I did it at the end...
[27:44.660 --> 27:47.340]  If I did it at the end, then I could just wait out the podcast ending.
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.160]  And then I wouldn't have to face...
[27:50.580 --> 27:51.300]  The popsicle.
[27:51.940 --> 27:54.360]  Which I'm still, you know, not super on board with.
[27:54.460 --> 27:55.340]  Just so you guys know.
[27:56.540 --> 27:57.540]  Well, you don't have to.
[27:57.620 --> 27:58.860]  I was just curious if you did the homework.
[27:59.480 --> 28:00.680]  That's really where this stemmed from.
[28:00.960 --> 28:01.580]  No, I didn't.
[28:01.820 --> 28:02.400]  I didn't.
[28:02.420 --> 28:02.600]  Okay.
[28:02.860 --> 28:03.640]  And I'm taking the punishment.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.340]  I did my homework.
[28:06.000 --> 28:06.900]  My homework is done.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.140]  You want to give us a homework update?
[28:08.280 --> 28:08.720]  Did you get us a...
[28:08.720 --> 28:09.540]  You get us a...
[28:09.540 --> 28:10.660]  You got us a jet ski?
[28:11.400 --> 28:11.760]  I've...
[28:11.760 --> 28:12.900]  I've secured...
[28:12.900 --> 28:14.400]  Secured some aquatic vehicles.
[28:14.780 --> 28:15.280]  That's all I'll say.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.960]  That was the standard last time.
[28:18.960 --> 28:20.220]  I've reached out.
[28:20.800 --> 28:22.140]  I've acquired what we need.
[28:22.520 --> 28:25.020]  Jet skis are in hand.
[28:25.760 --> 28:26.120]  Possibly.
[28:26.840 --> 28:27.980]  I don't want to tip my hand.
[28:28.060 --> 28:28.760]  It'll be a nice surprise.
[28:28.860 --> 28:29.460]  But we got them.
[28:29.820 --> 28:30.360]  I did mine.
[28:30.460 --> 28:30.980]  I did my part.
[28:30.980 --> 28:33.140]  I don't like the way you phrased it as aquatic vehicles.
[28:33.360 --> 28:35.700]  It was like how you phrased writing utensil.
[28:35.800 --> 28:36.880]  We don't know what that's going to mean.
[28:39.240 --> 28:40.520]  Uh, it's a let...
[28:40.520 --> 28:41.020]  Well, hmm.
[28:41.980 --> 28:42.720]  It's a jet ski.
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.140]  I think that's fair.
[28:44.520 --> 28:44.580]  Yes.
[28:44.960 --> 28:45.840]  I got us what we needed.
[28:45.960 --> 28:46.680]  I did my part.
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.620]  You bought a pair of skis with fireworks on the back, haven't you?
[28:50.700 --> 28:52.060]  That's a jet ski to you.
[28:52.140 --> 28:53.040]  What have you made?
[28:55.100 --> 28:56.200]  I haven't made anything.
[28:56.580 --> 28:58.100]  I did not make a single thing.
[28:58.260 --> 28:59.580]  I've acquired this as a product.
[29:00.000 --> 29:00.660]  We're good.
[29:01.040 --> 29:01.940]  I've done my part.
[29:01.980 --> 29:04.500]  Aren't we supposed to do something in GTA or something?
[29:05.640 --> 29:06.040]  First...
[29:06.040 --> 29:08.980]  I don't know why you made me do the homework of acquiring the vehicles
[29:08.980 --> 29:12.920]  before we did the part where we're going to test in a video game if it was worth doing.
[29:13.200 --> 29:14.420]  But I've done my part.
[29:14.420 --> 29:17.860]  I tried to actually set that up today and I realized I don't have GTA installed
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.500]  and it takes a fucking year to install.
[29:19.660 --> 29:21.520]  So it's installing in the background right now.
[29:22.080 --> 29:23.500]  So that I can build that map for us.
[29:24.080 --> 29:24.480]  Okay.
[29:25.120 --> 29:25.840]  Has everybody...
[29:25.840 --> 29:26.320]  Oh, I'm excited.
[29:26.560 --> 29:27.560]  Is everybody else hot?
[29:30.120 --> 29:30.520]  Goddamn.
[29:31.600 --> 29:32.540]  I don't even get a drink.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.000]  You guys keep... I'll be back.
[29:34.040 --> 29:34.600]  I need a drink.
[29:35.460 --> 29:37.000]  I suffered a great betrayal.
[29:37.160 --> 29:38.320]  Where do you think he's gonna pull the drink?
[29:38.540 --> 29:39.140]  Yeah, what's the betrayal?
[29:40.760 --> 29:41.660]  That's a great question.
[29:41.760 --> 29:42.840]  I'd assume the mouth.
[29:43.040 --> 29:43.940]  I don't think the ass.
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.440]  You think that Geoff has like a butt chug type setup for...
[29:48.440 --> 29:51.120]  If you were going to try to alleviate...
[29:51.120 --> 29:51.780]  Would you use water?
[29:52.460 --> 29:54.580]  Like what liquid would you use to...
[29:54.580 --> 29:55.380]  On a hot ass?
[29:55.820 --> 29:57.420]  Yeah, hot ass.
[29:57.720 --> 29:58.720]  Probably just cold water.
[29:58.860 --> 29:59.720]  Yeah, I think so.
[29:59.720 --> 30:01.960]  I'd probably... I'd probably lie down in the bath.
[30:02.700 --> 30:07.640]  Swing the old legs, you know, knees up towards the head and turn on the cold tap.
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.780]  I think I'd go sparkling water, personally.
[30:10.380 --> 30:11.040]  I want a little bit of both.
[30:11.700 --> 30:12.680]  Make it a little bit fun.
[30:12.760 --> 30:12.900]  Why?
[30:14.140 --> 30:17.300]  You'd add fizz to a tangy anus?
[30:17.360 --> 30:17.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:17.940 --> 30:19.960]  Sounds like a nightmare. The bubbling would be a nightmare.
[30:20.640 --> 30:22.300]  Oh, it just sounds like a fun time.
[30:23.680 --> 30:24.880]  Normal water is bland.
[30:25.200 --> 30:27.580]  It's been an anus heavy couple of weeks.
[30:27.700 --> 30:31.040]  And I think Geoff has guaranteed that by putting something into his this episode.
[30:32.540 --> 30:33.020]  Um...
[30:33.020 --> 30:34.360]  Yeah, we're not a...
[30:35.880 --> 30:39.220]  We're not a podcast about...
[30:40.080 --> 30:42.080]  We're not a podcast about sports.
[30:43.520 --> 30:46.180]  Survivor or buttholes, but they come up a lot.
[30:49.120 --> 30:50.520]  My great betrayal.
[30:50.860 --> 30:52.440]  My pillow wall betrayed me.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.260]  I got betrayed.
[30:54.560 --> 30:55.760]  Did you wake up with a stiff neck?
[30:56.040 --> 30:57.340]  Oh no, that has never happened.
[30:57.460 --> 30:58.920]  Did it collapse on you and bury you?
[30:59.280 --> 31:01.620]  No, well sort of. It didn't bury me.
[31:01.940 --> 31:03.080]  So I had a whole issue.
[31:03.640 --> 31:04.940]  I took some damage.
[31:05.720 --> 31:06.940]  The pillow wall fell down.
[31:07.120 --> 31:08.980]  It was a great collapse of the pillow wall.
[31:09.100 --> 31:11.220]  But I wasn't in the bed when it fell.
[31:11.760 --> 31:13.080]  I just climbed into bed.
[31:13.240 --> 31:16.200]  And I hate laying on pillows that are on me.
[31:16.460 --> 31:17.200]  Like underneath me.
[31:17.420 --> 31:18.580]  I find it super uncomfortable.
[31:19.140 --> 31:19.600]  I need to...
[31:20.500 --> 31:22.420]  Like if it's on my body, I don't like it.
[31:22.640 --> 31:26.020]  I need to have my head or shoulder as the main point of contact.
[31:26.380 --> 31:28.120]  So I slid down the bed.
[31:28.960 --> 31:31.300]  And because the pillow was in like the middle of the bed,
[31:31.380 --> 31:34.580]  my feet were hanging out the bottom of the bed by quite a lot.
[31:34.720 --> 31:35.980]  And I'm not a fan of that either.
[31:36.420 --> 31:39.580]  I still have it baked into when I was a kid.
[31:39.580 --> 31:41.960]  You know, like the monster under the bed type thing.
[31:42.060 --> 31:45.200]  I don't like any limb or my feet sticking out the bottom.
[31:45.340 --> 31:46.560]  It's just easy to grab.
[31:46.980 --> 31:48.120]  It makes me uncomfortable.
[31:48.400 --> 31:49.100]  I don't like it.
[31:49.360 --> 31:50.700]  I'm not a fan of it at all.
[31:51.220 --> 31:52.460]  But I slept like that one night.
[31:52.540 --> 31:53.180]  It was terrible.
[31:53.560 --> 31:55.700]  So the next day, or I guess a few days later,
[31:56.140 --> 31:57.900]  I was sleeping in my bed.
[31:57.980 --> 32:01.120]  And I was dreaming that I was back in that scenario again.
[32:01.520 --> 32:03.280]  My dream was that I was in the middle of the bed.
[32:03.360 --> 32:04.500]  My feet were sticking out.
[32:04.560 --> 32:05.760]  And I was like, ah, this is no good.
[32:05.780 --> 32:06.860]  I got to climb up the bed.
[32:07.640 --> 32:08.800]  Smash my head into the wall.
[32:08.800 --> 32:10.240]  I was already at the top of the bed.
[32:10.700 --> 32:17.400]  I went full force, head first, forehead first into my wall, smashed it against it.
[32:17.400 --> 32:19.560]  Wait, so you were lying down in bed,
[32:19.960 --> 32:23.120]  dreaming that you were lying down in bed, but a foot further down?
[32:23.500 --> 32:23.940]  Yes.
[32:24.340 --> 32:25.440]  Yes, that was my dream.
[32:25.820 --> 32:28.360]  And in the dream, I was like, I need to get higher.
[32:28.480 --> 32:29.660]  There was no higher to go.
[32:29.800 --> 32:33.740]  But in my dream, I picked myself up off the bed and like threw myself upwards.
[32:34.260 --> 32:36.420]  And I went straight into the wall.
[32:36.640 --> 32:38.660]  I just lifted up and headbutted it.
[32:38.660 --> 32:40.760]  What time is it when this happens?
[32:41.460 --> 32:43.100]  It's like 7.30 a.m. maybe.
[32:43.920 --> 32:45.220]  And you're dead ass asleep?
[32:45.860 --> 32:50.220]  I was dead ass asleep and I got woken up and I fucking, it was not good.
[32:50.460 --> 32:51.580]  Is it dark in the room?
[32:51.980 --> 32:52.920]  Oh, it's so bright.
[32:53.260 --> 32:55.620]  As I said before, my blinds are some bullshit.
[32:55.960 --> 32:57.160]  They don't they don't block anything.
[32:57.260 --> 32:58.100]  So it's super bright.
[32:58.440 --> 32:59.880]  I'm very confused.
[32:59.960 --> 33:01.200]  I'm angry at my dream.
[33:01.440 --> 33:04.120]  I'm angry at my pillow wall for deceiving me.
[33:04.380 --> 33:05.940]  This deception caused by collapsing.
[33:05.940 --> 33:08.740]  How was none of it of like all the seven or eight pillows?
[33:08.840 --> 33:10.240]  How was none of them against the wall, though?
[33:11.000 --> 33:12.700]  Because I was at the very top of the wall.
[33:13.260 --> 33:13.760]  So they were.
[33:13.880 --> 33:17.260]  I was still it doesn't make any sense.
[33:17.280 --> 33:18.760]  Still, I've seen pictures of it.
[33:18.860 --> 33:19.140]  I know.
[33:19.180 --> 33:21.500]  How are you sleeping on the top of the eighth pillow?
[33:21.840 --> 33:23.460]  How is your back not upright?
[33:23.940 --> 33:24.980]  Oh, I'm on my side.
[33:25.340 --> 33:27.680]  So it was a side dive into the wall.
[33:27.740 --> 33:30.020]  And I bring some of the pillows down with me, I guess.
[33:30.120 --> 33:30.860]  I don't I don't know.
[33:30.980 --> 33:35.240]  But yeah, I woke up to me slamming my head into my wall.
[33:35.240 --> 33:37.020]  I like stuff that makes you bad.
[33:37.740 --> 33:39.400]  Like when you had to take a hate nap.
[33:40.540 --> 33:45.000]  What was the most annoyed you've been recently over something that doesn't matter,
[33:45.100 --> 33:46.640]  like long term in your life?
[33:46.780 --> 33:47.840]  Oh, the most annoying.
[33:47.880 --> 33:50.080]  Like slipping on a sushi container or something small like that.
[33:50.440 --> 33:51.700]  That's not even that was funny.
[33:51.760 --> 33:53.580]  I was laughing when I fell on the sushi container.
[33:53.660 --> 33:53.800]  Yeah.
[33:53.900 --> 33:56.060]  I just mean something as inconsequential as that.
[33:56.500 --> 33:58.740]  The most inconse... that I was angry about?
[33:58.820 --> 34:00.640]  That I was like genuinely frustrated about?
[34:01.080 --> 34:01.360]  Yeah.
[34:03.580 --> 34:04.460]  Uh, fuck.
[34:05.140 --> 34:07.860]  I don't get frustrated all that often.
[34:08.260 --> 34:10.340]  I was as frustrated about...
[34:10.340 --> 34:12.640]  I'm not sure if we talked about on this podcast or a different one.
[34:12.940 --> 34:17.920]  Did I talk about what always makes me like 10 out of 10 angry suddenly?
[34:18.240 --> 34:19.180]  And it's really irrational?
[34:20.040 --> 34:20.220]  No.
[34:20.340 --> 34:20.540]  No.
[34:21.540 --> 34:25.340]  It's if I... it doesn't really happen anymore because of wireless headphones.
[34:25.480 --> 34:31.200]  But if I ever had like headphones in on a wire and I caught it on like a door handle
[34:31.200 --> 34:35.840]  and it ripped the headphones out of my ears, it just really pissed me off.
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.720]  To the point where I was like way more annoyed than most other things.
[34:39.880 --> 34:42.860]  I would go to like from like 1 out of 10 to 10 out of 10
[34:42.860 --> 34:45.300]  for like 5 seconds and then back down to 1.
[34:45.480 --> 34:48.880]  But I can't describe why that's so annoying to me.
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.260]  I just... I freaking hate it when that happens.
[34:53.140 --> 34:55.380]  Well, luckily that... oh man my butt.
[34:55.500 --> 35:00.000]  That uh... luckily that should never happen to you again, right?
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.720]  Because you'll just use earbuds, right?
[35:02.600 --> 35:03.080]  Uh, maybe.
[35:03.380 --> 35:03.940]  Like that problem solved.
[35:04.460 --> 35:06.740]  You know, I got... I have one and it involves you.
[35:08.460 --> 35:09.260]  Oh man.
[35:10.580 --> 35:11.400]  It involves me?
[35:11.700 --> 35:12.000]  Yeah.
[35:12.300 --> 35:16.500]  I got irrationally angry at you for like 2 seconds last night when I looked over at you
[35:16.500 --> 35:19.820]  and you were smirking when it looked like my character in Survivor
[35:19.820 --> 35:22.360]  was trying to hang herself and get voted out.
[35:22.520 --> 35:24.080]  And I was like, you motherfucker.
[35:24.360 --> 35:27.080]  I was... I was like... I was angry at you for like 2 seconds.
[35:27.080 --> 35:28.330]  And I gave a little like...
[35:30.340 --> 35:32.460]  But you can't have been angry-angry.
[35:32.800 --> 35:35.180]  I was for like 1 second. I was like, you...
[35:35.180 --> 35:37.760]  I was like, oh yeah, this is... we're off-duty.
[35:42.500 --> 35:43.280]  You have that ability.
[35:43.280 --> 35:44.100]  You were so close to going.
[35:44.280 --> 35:47.560]  Yeah, I don't want us to go necessarily too far down the Survivor rabbit hole.
[35:47.900 --> 35:48.280]  No, let's not do it.
[35:48.480 --> 35:50.740]  That's one of the worst picks I've ever seen, Geoff.
[35:50.920 --> 35:52.160]  That was a horrendous pick.
[35:52.700 --> 35:55.280]  I didn't process at the time when you texted it last night.
[35:55.280 --> 35:57.400]  What a dog shit pick by you.
[35:57.580 --> 35:58.200]  No, no, I...
[35:58.200 --> 35:59.340]  0% chance that that happened.
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.100]  I completely and totally agree with you, Andrew.
[36:01.240 --> 36:02.400]  Here's... here's how that went.
[36:02.840 --> 36:06.880]  So I thought when we... I thought when we were going to pick Survivor,
[36:06.900 --> 36:08.280]  the way Emily and I always do it,
[36:08.320 --> 36:11.080]  is we pick who we think is going to win in the opening episode
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.540]  when they do the first reveal with the name...
[36:13.540 --> 36:15.000]  in the montage with the names and the characters.
[36:15.900 --> 36:16.980]  I picked her there.
[36:17.340 --> 36:19.960]  Because she had like a cancer surviving story.
[36:20.460 --> 36:22.240]  She was, you know, she's a double mastectomy survivor.
[36:22.880 --> 36:24.040]  It was like inspirational.
[36:24.040 --> 36:25.740]  I know that Survivor tends to...
[36:25.740 --> 36:27.700]  the editors tend to love those kinds of stories
[36:27.700 --> 36:28.800]  and those people tend to go far.
[36:29.840 --> 36:31.580]  And they also have like a new lease on life
[36:31.580 --> 36:33.980]  and they tend to be able to push themselves further and stuff
[36:33.980 --> 36:35.640]  because they... like no matter how bad this is,
[36:35.680 --> 36:37.840]  it's probably not as bad as what they've gone through previously, you know?
[36:38.080 --> 36:40.200]  So I feel like sometimes those people tend to like...
[36:40.960 --> 36:43.320]  tend to rise to the top in Survivor.
[36:43.440 --> 36:46.180]  And so I made the decision then in my head
[36:46.180 --> 36:49.440]  and then when we didn't end up picking until later on at the end,
[36:49.520 --> 36:50.360]  the next season, I thought,
[36:50.460 --> 36:52.900]  well, to be fair to the way I play it anyway,
[36:52.900 --> 36:55.060]  I'll just stick with who my first thought was
[36:55.060 --> 36:56.660]  because that's who my first thought was.
[36:56.760 --> 36:58.140]  And I don't think she'll win.
[36:58.260 --> 37:00.840]  And I'm amazed that she didn't get herself voted out this week.
[37:00.920 --> 37:04.800]  Well, I picked the guy that looks like Dave England and Howard Stern had a baby.
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.480]  He's my favorite character of the show so far.
[37:08.600 --> 37:09.700]  I think he's got what it takes.
[37:10.300 --> 37:12.580]  No, I think he will make it to the end.
[37:12.820 --> 37:13.660]  I'm just surprised.
[37:13.820 --> 37:15.500]  So they did their whole mantra, as you're right, Geoff,
[37:15.540 --> 37:16.800]  her whole story, very inspiring.
[37:17.100 --> 37:21.780]  Also, a key part of her story was that she was almost not on the show.
[37:21.780 --> 37:24.420]  It sounded like she was a replacement for a replacement.
[37:24.620 --> 37:24.880]  She was.
[37:25.240 --> 37:25.320]  Yeah.
[37:25.980 --> 37:28.780]  So I don't I'm surprised that that also didn't factor in.
[37:28.860 --> 37:30.060]  Like, clearly not a top.
[37:30.920 --> 37:33.060]  Yeah, it's more like it was meant to be.
[37:34.060 --> 37:34.940]  OK, fair enough.
[37:36.080 --> 37:37.740]  I like Gavin's pick more, and I thought,
[37:37.860 --> 37:41.120]  well, I think I'm so distracted by Gavin's pick that I completely missed yours.
[37:41.980 --> 37:43.080]  And that is a great pick.
[37:43.140 --> 37:46.060]  The end of Survivor talk.
[37:46.280 --> 37:48.000]  Yeah, we're not going to talk about that anymore.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.220]  Oh, man.
[37:51.680 --> 37:52.200]  How's your aches?
[37:52.500 --> 37:52.800]  You OK?
[37:53.080 --> 37:53.780]  It's not good.
[37:53.900 --> 38:01.060]  I mean, it's like it's making me tired, like it's sapping my energy, you know,
[38:01.620 --> 38:03.980]  because it doesn't it doesn't get any worse or get any better.
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.080]  It's just like you maintain this level of pain.
[38:06.500 --> 38:10.220]  And then so you just have to it just like it drains your energy level.
[38:15.900 --> 38:19.220]  Fall can be hectic, but thanks to HelloFresh,
[38:19.220 --> 38:26.920]  you can save time and effort and money and energy and all of that stuff you would be spending
[38:26.920 --> 38:32.600]  on grocery shopping and shopping and planning and figuring out and stressing.
[38:33.500 --> 38:38.020]  It takes a lot of that pain away so that you can focus on getting back
[38:38.020 --> 38:41.440]  into a new routine and spending quality time with your family.
[38:41.900 --> 38:46.400]  They do that by offering 50 menu and market items to choose from every week,
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.480]  including vegetarian or calorie smart or gourmet options.
[38:50.480 --> 38:57.160]  If you're a snooty like me, they provide plenty of variety and ingredients travel from the farm
[38:57.160 --> 39:02.540]  to your door within a week so you get the convenience without skimping on the quality.
[39:02.620 --> 39:09.280]  Like I know in my personal cooking history, I've always I always I tend to overcook chicken.
[39:09.840 --> 39:13.780]  I don't know what it is, but somehow when I follow the HelloFresh recipes,
[39:13.780 --> 39:16.220]  I always end up with perfectly juicy chicken.
[39:16.760 --> 39:22.580]  So I think they're ancillarily making me a better cook in the process, which I appreciate.
[39:23.080 --> 39:29.720]  So go to HelloFresh.com slash face 14 and use code face 14 for up to 14 free meals,
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.540]  including free shipping.
[39:31.760 --> 39:34.660]  That is HelloFresh.com slash face 14.
[39:34.860 --> 39:39.740]  Use code face 14 for 14 free meals, including free shipping.
[39:39.740 --> 39:43.340]  HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit.
[39:44.220 --> 39:47.600]  There is so much going on in the world, whether it's stuff you're excited about.
[39:47.800 --> 39:49.600]  For me, it's fall bike rides.
[39:49.740 --> 39:54.160]  It's finally consistently under 100 degrees in the afternoon.
[39:54.300 --> 39:58.440]  So I can take like a a brisk 92 mile an hour bike ride,
[39:58.540 --> 40:02.000]  knowing that in a couple months, it'll be like an 80, 85 mile an hour bike ride.
[40:02.220 --> 40:03.380]  Very excited about that.
[40:03.500 --> 40:08.540]  Or stuff you'd rather not think about, like, I don't know, waiting at the doctor's office.
[40:08.540 --> 40:10.680]  You can't always control the vibes,
[40:11.160 --> 40:17.040]  but you can control the vibes in your head with a pair of Raycon wireless earbuds in your ears.
[40:17.180 --> 40:19.940]  Whether you use them to pump up, wind down,
[40:20.240 --> 40:25.580]  work, workout, or just ride like the wind like I do on my little bicycle.
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.000]  Raycons are my go-to for the on-the-go audio.
[40:30.600 --> 40:33.720]  And the new everyday earbuds look, feel, and sound better than ever.
[40:34.340 --> 40:35.300]  Those are all good things.
[40:35.300 --> 40:38.280]  They have an improved rubber oil look and feel,
[40:38.820 --> 40:41.520]  and optimized gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit.
[40:41.760 --> 40:44.020]  These are impressive before you even start listening.
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.860]  And then you get to listen and it gets even better because they sound fantastic.
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.300]  There's also an all-new awareness mode for when you need to listen to your surroundings instead.
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.380]  Raycons offer eight hours of playtime and a 32-hour battery life.
[40:57.600 --> 41:00.120]  I wish I could ride my bike for 32 straight hours.
[41:00.460 --> 41:00.980]  Maybe someday.
[41:00.980 --> 41:07.800]  Right now, F*** Face listeners can get 15% off the Raycon order at buyraycon.com slash face.
[41:07.980 --> 41:13.820]  That's buyraycon.com slash face to save 15% on Raycons.
[41:14.160 --> 41:16.140]  Buyraycon.com slash face.
[41:18.700 --> 41:23.660]  I have another note in my F*** Face notes that I don't understand.
[41:24.180 --> 41:24.480]  Uh-huh. Okay.
[41:24.560 --> 41:25.380]  And I'm...
[41:25.380 --> 41:26.120]  Bog roll folders.
[41:26.200 --> 41:28.400]  Similar to... similar to bog roll folders.
[41:28.540 --> 41:29.480]  I don't know what this means.
[41:29.700 --> 41:30.500]  Okay, this is the note.
[41:31.300 --> 41:32.740]  Timing pisses wrong.
[41:32.900 --> 41:34.980]  Anyone else sucked a glass?
[41:36.740 --> 41:38.090]  Timing pisses... so...
[41:38.760 --> 41:40.320]  What could that mean?
[41:40.840 --> 41:43.920]  Suck the glass could be in reference to when I gave myself hickeys.
[41:44.180 --> 41:45.640]  Sucking the bottle cap, maybe?
[41:45.740 --> 41:47.780]  We talked about glass sucking at that time.
[41:48.280 --> 41:50.360]  I don't know if that's... that's related to that.
[41:50.940 --> 41:51.900]  Timing pissing.
[41:52.480 --> 41:52.860]  Hmm.
[41:53.280 --> 41:55.580]  I'm thinking about Austin Powers.
[41:56.140 --> 41:56.620]  I don't know.
[41:57.200 --> 41:59.020]  Is this a recent... when do you write your notes?
[42:00.940 --> 42:04.560]  Um, this is a fairly... this is probably the last two months.
[42:05.300 --> 42:05.860]  No, I don't.
[42:06.140 --> 42:09.700]  Oh, Nick says, is this a drink contest so you can go the longest without pissing?
[42:10.160 --> 42:11.100]  No, I don't think it's that.
[42:11.180 --> 42:11.680]  Is that your confidence?
[42:11.680 --> 42:12.260]  Yeah, that's another one.
[42:12.340 --> 42:13.200]  Do you have piss confidence?
[42:14.600 --> 42:15.920]  No, I don't have piss confidence.
[42:16.540 --> 42:17.300]  Narrow that off the list.
[42:17.500 --> 42:18.580]  What could that mean?
[42:18.860 --> 42:21.220]  Comment leavers, um, let me know if...
[42:21.220 --> 42:25.300]  By the way, can I just say this is perfect retribution for me for all the years you made
[42:25.300 --> 42:28.460]  fun of me for not understanding my notes that I would write in the idea book.
[42:31.800 --> 42:32.840]  I love this.
[42:33.100 --> 42:34.760]  And I was sober when I wrote that.
[42:36.880 --> 42:39.560]  I had a realization, I know Geoff, you've seen it.
[42:39.940 --> 42:41.020]  I've talked to Eric about it.
[42:41.080 --> 42:41.780]  Gavin has no idea.
[42:41.880 --> 42:43.120]  I'd love to ask Gavin this question.
[42:43.260 --> 42:43.300]  Okay.
[42:43.680 --> 42:45.980]  Just to see, see his, his perspective.
[42:46.660 --> 42:50.120]  Have you ever seen a train car outside of the McDonald's?
[42:51.400 --> 42:51.800]  No.
[42:53.320 --> 42:58.280]  So I, the McDonald's where I grew up, both of them had train cars outside of them.
[42:58.280 --> 42:59.280]  On the street?
[42:59.400 --> 42:59.740]  What do you mean?
[43:00.100 --> 43:00.540]  On a track?
[43:00.580 --> 43:02.440]  No, like, like right next to the restaurant.
[43:02.640 --> 43:05.020]  Like they were connected to the, they were right outside.
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.160]  They were like, probably like, I don't know, 15 feet away from the restaurant, typically.
[43:09.700 --> 43:10.500]  To the side.
[43:10.720 --> 43:13.860]  When you'd have a birthday party, that's where they'd hold the party.
[43:13.960 --> 43:15.160]  All the kids would get to go on the train.
[43:15.240 --> 43:16.020]  You eat in the McDonald's.
[43:16.200 --> 43:17.600]  It was called Ronald's Caboose.
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.780]  And it was just part, it was part of my McDonald's experience growing up.
[43:24.060 --> 43:27.780]  And I was thinking, I'd never thought about it my whole life until like two nights, three
[43:27.780 --> 43:28.280]  nights ago.
[43:28.420 --> 43:33.240]  It's like, that's fucking weird that there's nothing about the McDonald's brand that has
[43:33.240 --> 43:34.320]  trains tied to it.
[43:34.440 --> 43:36.740]  Why was there a train in these McDonald's?
[43:37.060 --> 43:38.020]  Why was this a thing?
[43:38.600 --> 43:41.240]  So I, I asked somebody, they lived in a different country.
[43:41.440 --> 43:44.200]  So I assumed like, oh, that makes sense that they wouldn't have it.
[43:45.260 --> 43:50.340]  But then I learned that apparently the McDonald's train is not a universal staple of like 90s
[43:50.340 --> 43:51.360]  childhood McDonald's.
[43:51.640 --> 43:56.800]  There are like rare, there's only a handful of McDonald's that had these trains.
[43:56.800 --> 43:58.100]  I still don't know why they are.
[43:58.180 --> 43:58.720]  I'll try to.
[43:58.860 --> 44:02.980]  So they were specifically put there for, they didn't just buy a lot of land that had a train
[44:02.980 --> 44:03.520]  stuck on it?
[44:03.540 --> 44:08.720]  No, they were, they specifically bought these trains for their restaurants.
[44:08.980 --> 44:11.760]  It wasn't like they acquired it with the purchase of the land.
[44:11.920 --> 44:13.420]  They brought cabooses in.
[44:13.540 --> 44:19.600]  At one point, according to this train website, I read that McDonald's as a business own more
[44:19.600 --> 44:21.340]  cabooses than any other in the world.
[44:22.080 --> 44:23.480]  More than a train company?
[44:23.480 --> 44:25.680]  They had more cabooses than like freight companies?
[44:25.680 --> 44:28.920]  Listen, I realized that that seems like an absurd statement.
[44:29.060 --> 44:30.220]  I'm not the one sourcing it.
[44:30.280 --> 44:33.380]  This was according to some train fan website.
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.140]  And I'm going to trust the enthusiasm.
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.180]  If you own a train website and you're updating it, I feel like you're probably pretty knowledgeable
[44:40.180 --> 44:40.760]  about trains.
[44:41.340 --> 44:44.940]  Is a caboose a specific type of train car or is it just the back one?
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.060]  What is a caboose?
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.400]  So based off of the images that I've seen, I think there is a regulation caboose.
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.640]  It might have slight, slight changes as far...
[44:56.640 --> 44:57.560]  That was another weird thing.
[44:57.880 --> 45:01.220]  There was no structure to how they had to look.
[45:01.380 --> 45:05.460]  Like there was regulations in, I guess, their company policy of where you could place them.
[45:05.740 --> 45:09.740]  But every McDonald's, every Ronald's caboose painted a little bit differently.
[45:11.920 --> 45:14.220]  This episode, regulation caboose.
[45:14.440 --> 45:15.200]  Regulation caboose.
[45:15.260 --> 45:17.360]  Let me see if I can find photos of...
[45:18.140 --> 45:19.760]  It appears we've lost Geoff.
[45:19.960 --> 45:21.000]  We have lost Geoff.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.720]  We've lost Geoff to his own anus.
[45:24.180 --> 45:26.860]  He wrote in the chat, I got to go deal with this.
[45:27.060 --> 45:28.180]  It hurts too bad.
[45:29.440 --> 45:29.800]  BRB.
[45:30.220 --> 45:32.120]  This is a photo of Ronald's caboose.
[45:32.200 --> 45:36.120]  This is the one of the ones outside of, outside of McDonald's where I live.
[45:36.240 --> 45:37.580]  This is a Ronald's caboose, Gavin.
[45:38.900 --> 45:39.620]  Ronald's caboose.
[45:39.860 --> 45:42.800]  It is like painted red and yellow like McDonald's.
[45:43.060 --> 45:43.460]  It is.
[45:43.540 --> 45:44.880]  There's a few other ones that I like.
[45:44.960 --> 45:46.680]  I'm not sure where this one is based out of.
[45:46.760 --> 45:48.020]  This is one of my favorite designs.
[45:48.120 --> 45:50.000]  It looks like it's just ramming into the restaurant.
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.780]  It's moments before disaster.
[45:52.180 --> 45:54.540]  They've built a McDonald's on a train car.
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.800]  This is, I've never seen anything like this.
[45:57.880 --> 45:58.360]  It expands.
[45:58.660 --> 46:02.180]  I thought the ones, the McDonald's with like the golden arches were the rare ones.
[46:02.300 --> 46:03.320]  Like the old style ones.
[46:03.660 --> 46:06.020]  The ones where the train crashed through the side of the building.
[46:06.120 --> 46:06.980]  That's the rare one.
[46:07.100 --> 46:07.740]  Where is that?
[46:07.960 --> 46:09.480]  I'd have no idea where that one is.
[46:09.700 --> 46:10.840]  I have another one though.
[46:10.900 --> 46:11.300]  It gets wild.
[46:11.500 --> 46:12.440]  There is a variation.
[46:12.640 --> 46:17.060]  I just don't think people realize that there's a whole theme of McDonald's based vehicle restaurants.
[46:17.580 --> 46:20.180]  There is a McDonald's plane in New Zealand.
[46:20.680 --> 46:24.700]  They've got a plane version where you can like order the food from the restaurant and then hop
[46:24.700 --> 46:25.320]  in the plane.
[46:26.020 --> 46:26.920]  Eat in the plane.
[46:27.420 --> 46:30.340]  I like that the wheel is off the ground as if it's taken off.
[46:30.400 --> 46:30.840]  There it is.
[46:31.680 --> 46:33.080]  I'd fly Air McDonald's.
[46:33.140 --> 46:35.220]  Have you eaten in a caboose in Ronald's Caboose?
[46:35.240 --> 46:35.600]  I have.
[46:36.140 --> 46:36.720]  Yeah, as a child.
[46:37.120 --> 46:37.960]  On Vancouver Island?
[46:38.340 --> 46:39.220]  On where I live.
[46:39.260 --> 46:39.460]  Yeah.
[46:39.820 --> 46:42.040]  There, I've been to birthday parties in the Ronald's Caboose.
[46:42.720 --> 46:44.220]  Add that to the list when we're crabbing.
[46:44.340 --> 46:46.020]  I think it's sadly gone.
[46:46.020 --> 46:47.420]  They've renovated since then.
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.760]  That's why I thought it was like a weird 90s thing because they're no longer there.
[46:50.900 --> 46:51.760]  At least where I live.
[46:52.260 --> 46:55.400]  And I was like, oh, that's a shame that they upgraded the restaurants and they got rid of
[46:55.400 --> 46:55.860]  the trains.
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.100]  That's the last known photo, Gavin, of Ronald's Caboose at the one restaurant.
[47:01.160 --> 47:01.640]  It's gone.
[47:01.800 --> 47:02.600]  They took it away.
[47:02.740 --> 47:03.380]  They took it away.
[47:03.720 --> 47:05.200]  That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.
[47:05.620 --> 47:05.960]  It is.
[47:06.100 --> 47:06.300]  Yeah.
[47:06.580 --> 47:08.500]  What a bleak looking day as well.
[47:12.620 --> 47:13.860]  Oh, that's tragic.
[47:14.700 --> 47:15.860]  Yeah, it was very tragic.
[47:15.860 --> 47:19.800]  So it's a weird, it's a weird thing where I thought everyone had this experience.
[47:20.140 --> 47:22.760]  And I guess it's very unique to have a Ronald's Caboose.
[47:22.940 --> 47:24.940]  Were there special menu items for the Caboose?
[47:25.460 --> 47:27.880]  No, it's just like literally a place for birthday parties.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.740]  There's nothing like fancy about it.
[47:29.800 --> 47:33.360]  It was just you got to hop in the train and you were separated from the rest of the people
[47:33.360 --> 47:33.840]  in the restaurant.
[47:34.420 --> 47:35.400]  That's part of the experience.
[47:35.800 --> 47:36.560]  That is amazing.
[47:37.340 --> 47:38.500]  That's blown my mind a little bit.
[47:39.220 --> 47:42.680]  Spaghetti Warehouse has train cars inside the warehouse you can eat in.
[47:42.680 --> 47:43.820]  Spaghetti Warehouse?
[47:43.820 --> 47:44.620]  I've never heard of this.
[47:44.680 --> 47:45.960]  I've heard of the Spaghetti Factory.
[47:46.320 --> 47:47.400]  I've never heard of a warehouse.
[47:48.160 --> 47:49.200]  The Spaghetti Warehouse?
[47:49.360 --> 47:50.520]  Spaghetti Warehouse, yeah.
[47:50.720 --> 47:53.760]  Didn't that come up when we were talking about Cheesecake Factory, the Spaghetti Warehouse?
[47:54.320 --> 47:54.620]  Maybe.
[47:55.180 --> 47:55.920]  Yeah, probably.
[47:56.440 --> 47:57.180]  What was the thing?
[47:57.780 --> 48:00.940]  Cheesecake Factory workers don't identify as factory workers.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.180]  But I feel like this is sort of a great...
[48:06.180 --> 48:07.820]  People are always like, ah, Andrew's weird.
[48:08.100 --> 48:09.240]  But I don't think I'm weird.
[48:09.300 --> 48:11.600]  It's just this is a product of where I grew up.
[48:11.600 --> 48:14.000]  Yeah, that picture of the McDonald's train.
[48:14.140 --> 48:15.500]  That means you're not weird.
[48:15.820 --> 48:17.600]  Yeah, I think it's more of a...
[48:17.600 --> 48:20.540]  If people are like, you're in a different dimension, maybe I am.
[48:22.700 --> 48:25.500]  Oh, that's a fancy train car for that spaghetti place.
[48:25.740 --> 48:26.780]  It's a Spaghetti Warehouse.
[48:26.960 --> 48:28.640]  It's not just for anybody.
[48:28.780 --> 48:29.600]  It's high class.
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.560]  Also, uh, uh, I gotta be honest with you guys.
[48:37.520 --> 48:40.360]  If anything, it made it worse.
[48:40.940 --> 48:41.340]  Okay.
[48:44.280 --> 48:45.200]  Oh, no.
[48:45.860 --> 48:47.140]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[48:48.140 --> 48:53.580]  Clearly, uh, clearly we need to, uh, go back to the drawing board, which is fine.
[48:53.660 --> 48:57.200]  That's what that's what R&D is is for.
[48:57.400 --> 49:02.820]  I think that we need to incorporate, uh, if I had to guess, maybe some aloe into the milk.
[49:03.460 --> 49:10.020]  Yeah, but, uh, I'm not giving up on the idea.
[49:10.020 --> 49:12.240]  I think there's still obviously a need.
[49:12.700 --> 49:17.080]  Uh, the audience has been, uh, has this even come out to the audience yet?
[49:17.800 --> 49:18.480]  The one we're recording?
[49:18.980 --> 49:20.120]  No, they haven't seen any of this.
[49:21.300 --> 49:22.820]  They're not even aware of the product.
[49:23.340 --> 49:26.960]  I have, I'm sure that when the audience discovers the product, I'll feel vindicated.
[49:27.260 --> 49:30.640]  Uh, everybody's gonna want a piece of this investment opportunity.
[49:30.800 --> 49:33.220]  Yeah, I think the only people who have seen it are the ones in the Slack.
[49:33.220 --> 49:41.060]  But, uh, yeah, uh, let me just, it's, uh, I didn't, it's, uh, if anything, it made it cold,
[49:41.200 --> 49:42.160]  made it burn more.
[49:42.900 --> 49:46.760]  So, so the cooling effect just made it cold, but it still burned?
[49:47.180 --> 49:49.240]  Yeah, it was, it was just like, it just made everything.
[49:49.400 --> 49:52.780]  It's like, it was, it's like enhanced the, uh, enhanced the whole thing.
[49:53.040 --> 49:53.300]  Um.
[49:53.360 --> 49:54.140]  And how was the flavor?
[49:56.060 --> 49:57.480]  Oh, you know, I don't like milk.
[49:58.060 --> 50:00.440]  Well, maybe, maybe you're selling the wrong thing, Geoff.
[50:00.500 --> 50:03.020]  Maybe this isn't a thing to soothe the pain.
[50:03.020 --> 50:04.800]  Maybe this is an enhancer product.
[50:05.000 --> 50:05.360]  Yeah.
[50:05.440 --> 50:07.800]  This is an anal enhancer that you have on your hands.
[50:08.000 --> 50:08.320]  It's not.
[50:08.640 --> 50:10.700]  Who needs to enhance anything in their anus?
[50:11.460 --> 50:15.340]  I, I mean, would you opt out of enhancing anything?
[50:15.700 --> 50:17.900]  If you have the choice to enhance, you always say yes.
[50:18.160 --> 50:19.160]  There's no negative to enhancing.
[50:19.300 --> 50:19.920]  What are you talking about?
[50:19.980 --> 50:21.980]  If someone said, hey, do you want me to enhance your headache?
[50:22.140 --> 50:23.060]  I'd say, no, thanks.
[50:23.640 --> 50:25.220]  Well, no, it could be a better headache.
[50:25.380 --> 50:26.660]  Yeah, you don't turn down a headache.
[50:26.660 --> 50:26.800]  What do you mean?
[50:27.060 --> 50:30.400]  When you, when you didn't go to, when you were in Cyberpunk, you didn't go,
[50:30.500 --> 50:31.920]  oh, no enhancements for me thing.
[50:31.920 --> 50:33.380]  I'll keep my normal anus.
[50:35.220 --> 50:37.120]  With a sword and double jump.
[50:38.540 --> 50:41.000]  I feel like typically the enhancement is a good thing.
[50:42.260 --> 50:43.320]  But I see what you're saying.
[50:43.560 --> 50:45.660]  An enhancement of a headache would be a bad thing because you're,
[50:45.660 --> 50:47.440]  you're theoretically making it more powerful.
[50:47.560 --> 50:47.680]  Yeah.
[50:47.900 --> 50:50.060]  Do you want to have an enhancement at losing a roulette?
[50:50.500 --> 50:51.320]  Well, I don't need that.
[50:51.380 --> 50:52.480]  I'm already pretty good at that.
[50:52.780 --> 50:54.300]  That's, that's not needed.
[50:54.760 --> 50:59.560]  Um, I don't think, yeah, I think I'd enhance most, most things.
[50:59.560 --> 51:02.460]  And I'm, listen, I'm not a judgmental person, Gavin.
[51:02.520 --> 51:05.940]  If somebody wants to enhance their asshole, it's not my business to know why.
[51:06.560 --> 51:08.360]  Just offering a product that will do that.
[51:09.360 --> 51:09.800]  It's true.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.020]  Gotta cover the market.
[51:11.220 --> 51:13.380]  Just because it's not for you doesn't mean it's not for somebody.
[51:14.100 --> 51:14.540]  Exactly.
[51:15.520 --> 51:15.900]  I don't know.
[51:15.900 --> 51:19.180]  There's somebody out there that's been waiting for years.
[51:19.800 --> 51:22.940]  If only my asshole could be enhanced, they've been saying.
[51:24.460 --> 51:26.120]  There's gotta be a better way.
[51:26.980 --> 51:27.720]  There has to be.
[51:27.720 --> 51:30.520]  And there also has to be a better way than what you designed,
[51:30.640 --> 51:35.860]  because I refuse to believe that a skewer with a milk thing on the end of it is not safe.
[51:36.140 --> 51:36.500]  Prototype.
[51:37.420 --> 51:40.240]  It wasn't meant to be the final production model.
[51:40.560 --> 51:42.080]  It's, it's, you gotta start somewhere.
[51:42.820 --> 51:46.140]  So based on this new R&D, is there gonna be a, a Mach 2?
[51:49.880 --> 51:51.440]  I don't, I don't think so.
[51:51.860 --> 51:53.700]  I don't know, man.
[51:53.740 --> 51:57.460]  I think, I think I got all the, I think we got all the comedy out of that joke.
[51:57.460 --> 51:59.400]  We'll just move on to the next product, maybe.
[52:00.020 --> 52:02.600]  I think if I was gonna design something to soothe the anus,
[52:02.680 --> 52:05.280]  it wouldn't be something that's long and goes in the anus.
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.900]  It would be something long that you sit on.
[52:07.280 --> 52:07.980]  Well, maybe.
[52:08.080 --> 52:12.580]  Like a, like a, like a frozen hot dog shape that I just sit on.
[52:12.940 --> 52:16.920]  And it sort of goes across, across the anus, across the gooch.
[52:17.760 --> 52:17.980]  No.
[52:18.100 --> 52:19.240]  And it's just a soothing seat.
[52:19.240 --> 52:21.480]  What if you need internal soothing?
[52:23.080 --> 52:24.580]  I'm not a fan of any of this.
[52:25.400 --> 52:25.780]  Why not?
[52:26.300 --> 52:28.000]  I just don't want hands control.
[52:28.160 --> 52:32.440]  I don't want to, I don't want gravity to be a factor in my, my process.
[52:32.740 --> 52:34.340]  How's gravity a fa- what do you mean?
[52:34.540 --> 52:39.100]  Well, well, I'm assuming, well, if you're making, well, I guess, okay.
[52:39.240 --> 52:41.700]  In my head, you are like sitting on.
[52:42.160 --> 52:43.780]  Not, not, not with it up me.
[52:44.500 --> 52:44.940]  It's not.
[52:45.140 --> 52:46.280]  Okay, that's, that's how I perceive the product.
[52:46.280 --> 52:49.860]  The hot dog, in Gavin's contraption, I believe the hot dog is horizontal.
[52:50.640 --> 52:50.940]  Yeah.
[52:51.320 --> 52:51.580]  Oh.
[52:51.900 --> 52:53.040]  He's straddling on.
[52:53.320 --> 52:55.760]  Gavin straddles a horizontal hot dog.
[52:56.200 --> 52:56.980]  Is how this-
[52:56.980 --> 53:00.700]  God, think of it, think of it like I'm riding a hot dog, like a wizard would ride a broom.
[53:00.820 --> 53:01.540]  I see what you're saying.
[53:01.860 --> 53:02.260]  Yeah.
[53:02.700 --> 53:03.100]  Understood.
[53:03.860 --> 53:04.380]  That's better.
[53:04.760 --> 53:07.120]  I still don't like this product category as a whole.
[53:08.640 --> 53:09.900]  No, it's for a whole.
[53:11.080 --> 53:11.400]  Yeah.
[53:11.660 --> 53:12.220]  No, it is.
[53:13.160 --> 53:14.560]  I wonder how many we could sell, though.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.160]  Just as a concept.
[53:16.660 --> 53:17.520]  What that even looks like.
[53:17.800 --> 53:18.480]  Yeah, I don't know.
[53:19.400 --> 53:21.660]  They, the merch didn't seem too excited about it.
[53:23.380 --> 53:25.140]  You actually asked them as well.
[53:25.140 --> 53:26.080]  That's not a joke.
[53:26.200 --> 53:29.420]  It was in the Slack asking about selling popsicles.
[53:30.000 --> 53:30.400]  Yeah.
[53:30.500 --> 53:33.920]  And they said that we don't have, like, some frozen storage.
[53:34.300 --> 53:36.200]  We have cold storage for the popsicles.
[53:36.460 --> 53:39.680]  The limitations of this product was us not having cold storage.
[53:39.860 --> 53:42.860]  There are no other issues with why this could be sold as it is.
[53:43.360 --> 53:44.100]  Well, as I said-
[53:44.100 --> 53:44.700]  It's the one inhibitor.
[53:45.040 --> 53:49.280]  You can buy, you buy Pop Ice and Otter Pops unfrozen and then you freeze them yourself at home.
[53:49.380 --> 53:50.100]  They make you do the work.
[53:50.600 --> 53:51.820]  It's the, it's the dairy of it.
[53:51.860 --> 53:53.040]  You can't have unfrozen dairy.
[53:53.040 --> 53:55.440]  It just doesn't keep that long in a warehouse, I assume.
[53:56.560 --> 54:01.060]  Even pivoting back to the McDonald's train for a moment, it did also,
[54:01.980 --> 54:06.140]  it brought back a memory in my life that I, that I forgot that I had.
[54:06.420 --> 54:10.780]  And it blew, it blew Eric's mind in our conversation about it.
[54:11.220 --> 54:14.460]  There was a Wendy's downtown, still there.
[54:14.920 --> 54:17.700]  When I was a kid, I was like, I don't know, maybe four or five.
[54:17.880 --> 54:19.140]  I'd go there quite a bit.
[54:19.500 --> 54:21.760]  And there was a woman, there's an older woman,
[54:21.760 --> 54:24.420]  I'd say probably late sixties, early seventies.
[54:24.940 --> 54:27.620]  She had red hair and her name was Wendy.
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.660]  And because of this, I thought that she was the Wendy of Wendy's.
[54:33.220 --> 54:36.400]  And I spent a large portion, probably it wasn't until I was a teenager
[54:36.400 --> 54:38.680]  that I realized that I didn't know Wendy from Wendy's.
[54:38.760 --> 54:41.660]  I thought I knew Wendy from Wendy's for a stretch of my life.
[54:41.780 --> 54:45.840]  And you just thought the Wendy of Wendy's worked in a Wendy's in Canada?
[54:46.540 --> 54:47.060]  Yeah. Yeah.
[54:47.140 --> 54:49.120]  Well, I didn't like, I was like, you know what?
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.260]  She looks a lot younger outside the restaurant.
[54:51.260 --> 54:53.800]  I'm sure this business has existed for a long time.
[54:53.980 --> 54:55.160]  She's just been a career employee.
[54:55.280 --> 54:57.640]  It's a family locally run thing.
[54:58.420 --> 54:59.540]  Wendy from Wendy's.
[54:59.600 --> 55:00.940]  I thought I knew Wendy from Wendy's.
[55:01.660 --> 55:02.260]  And we're close.
[55:02.640 --> 55:05.360]  Whenever I'd come in the restaurant, she'd say hi, we'd talk.
[55:05.540 --> 55:08.520]  She'd sometimes sit at her table and just talk with us while we ate.
[55:09.140 --> 55:10.680]  I had a friendship with Wendy.
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.780]  In your defense, I mean, Dave Thomas named Wendy's after his daughter, right?
[55:17.880 --> 55:19.500]  Wendy, who is a real person.
[55:19.500 --> 55:20.580]  What year was that?
[55:20.700 --> 55:22.260]  Who exists in the world.
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.160]  And I'm sure this lady who worked at, who was in her 60s and working at Wendy's
[55:27.160 --> 55:30.020]  and her name was Wendy, if it was even her real name,
[55:30.160 --> 55:34.460]  was probably delighted to let that little kid thought she was the Wendy.
[55:34.600 --> 55:36.560]  She probably encouraged that.
[55:36.840 --> 55:39.240]  And that's probably why you thought it was the case.
[55:39.620 --> 55:42.000]  I feel like I probably asked somebody and they're like, yeah.
[55:42.360 --> 55:43.760]  And just like the magic of it.
[55:43.880 --> 55:45.960]  Let the kid think that he knows Wendy from Wendy's.
[55:46.060 --> 55:47.180]  But I never really questioned it.
[55:47.300 --> 55:49.020]  So is this something you bragged about at school?
[55:49.500 --> 55:50.560]  I never bragged about it,
[55:50.620 --> 55:53.200]  but it was just the fact that I was friends with Wendy from Wendy's.
[55:53.440 --> 55:55.340]  You don't strike me as someone who brags.
[55:56.300 --> 55:58.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[55:58.080 --> 56:00.120]  I'm trying to think, like, what have I ever bragged about?
[56:00.240 --> 56:02.160]  I'm not a big bragger type person.
[56:02.640 --> 56:03.660]  I have confidence.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.240]  I have the burger confidence established.
[56:05.620 --> 56:07.560]  I very rarely will brag about something.
[56:07.680 --> 56:08.080]  That's Wendy.
[56:08.480 --> 56:09.260]  Did the lady look like that?
[56:09.260 --> 56:09.660]  That is Wendy.
[56:09.720 --> 56:11.260]  And she does work at Wendy's.
[56:11.260 --> 56:14.100]  So technically, it's not the most ridiculous thing.
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.640]  I don't think she works in a Wendy's though.
[56:17.020 --> 56:18.320]  Well, she works for Wendy's corporate.
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.080]  Hey, wait, is Wendy...
[56:20.900 --> 56:24.880]  Wait, the Dave Thomas was the Wendy's guy, right?
[56:24.940 --> 56:26.680]  Yeah, and his daughter's name is Wendy Thomas.
[56:27.100 --> 56:29.080]  Eric is saying that it's not.
[56:29.960 --> 56:31.620]  I thought it was... I agree with you.
[56:31.680 --> 56:32.900]  I thought that's what the story was, Geoff,
[56:32.900 --> 56:35.740]  that he named it after his daughter and his daughter who has...
[56:35.740 --> 56:36.480]  Eric, what's going on?
[56:36.480 --> 56:38.800]  ...red hair in this photo that Geoff just posted.
[56:39.380 --> 56:43.180]  She's the fourth child of American businessman Dave Thomas, founder of the fast food company.
[56:43.180 --> 56:43.720]  And what's her name?
[56:44.080 --> 56:45.500]  Melinda Lou Wendy Thomas.
[56:45.500 --> 56:50.620]  So one of the younger kids couldn't pronounce Melinda and called her Wendy
[56:50.620 --> 56:53.100]  and Dave Thomas went, the name of the restaurant's Wendy's.
[56:53.160 --> 56:53.900]  So he named it after...
[56:53.900 --> 56:55.120]  He didn't name it after any of his kids.
[56:55.500 --> 56:58.720]  Yeah, he named it after what his kid... one kid called another kid, a nickname.
[56:59.120 --> 57:03.600]  If one kid calls another kid that name, but nobody else does, that's the nickname?
[57:03.780 --> 57:06.720]  Do you think that nobody else in the family called that kid Wendy after that...
[57:06.720 --> 57:09.560]  I think they did after Dave Thomas named a restaurant after her.
[57:10.380 --> 57:10.860]  After her.
[57:11.140 --> 57:13.160]  I think they all went, we better buy into this lie.
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.060]  After her? You're right, he did.
[57:15.060 --> 57:19.360]  He named a restaurant after her. That's a good point. You said it. You made the point. Thank you.
[57:19.580 --> 57:22.860]  Yeah, Dave Thomas went, yeah, we're going to call it Wendy's and everyone went,
[57:22.980 --> 57:24.460]  well, I guess we better buy into this lie.
[57:25.140 --> 57:26.380]  I don't understand.
[57:26.720 --> 57:30.160]  She has Wendy in her name. It may not be her first name, but she has a Wendy in her name.
[57:30.180 --> 57:31.100]  Did she have any siblings?
[57:31.500 --> 57:33.720]  I think four. I think Geoff just said four.
[57:34.200 --> 57:34.360]  Oh.
[57:35.140 --> 57:36.180]  Yeah, they must be pissed.
[57:36.660 --> 57:37.600]  She's the fourth child.
[57:38.440 --> 57:38.820]  Oh, okay.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.540]  Oh, that is a rough one. Yeah. If she's the youngest of the kids waiting, that's some
[57:44.540 --> 57:47.100]  bullshit. If I was the oldest, I'd want naming rights.
[57:47.500 --> 57:48.980]  What were the other kids' names? Do you know, Geoff?
[57:49.540 --> 57:51.140]  Here, I'll just read what it says on,
[57:51.300 --> 57:54.740]  as a child, Melinda was unable to pronounce her L's and her R's,
[57:54.960 --> 57:59.260]  struggling with her own name, Melinda, and so became known by her nickname, Wendy.
[58:00.100 --> 58:05.820]  See, and then the rest of the family bought into it to feed this lie of Wendy's the restaurant.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.920]  Then eight-year-old Melinda would eventually become the namesake of her father's restaurant,
[58:10.040 --> 58:12.600]  Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, or just Wendy's for short.
[58:12.600 --> 58:16.720]  In addition to being a namesake, her likeness was used as the Wendy's logo.
[58:17.360 --> 58:22.020]  Now, I'm an only child, but I feel like I hear about the conversations of, like,
[58:22.020 --> 58:25.300]  who's the favorite kid. You cannot make that argument in that family.
[58:25.580 --> 58:32.060]  When one of the four has a restaurant chain named after them, it's without a... Wendy's number one.
[58:32.420 --> 58:35.740]  I'd like to know the other names, though, because it's, like, was there a scenario in which maybe
[58:35.740 --> 58:36.800]  we had Steve's?
[58:37.840 --> 58:41.980]  Uh, let's see if it lists, uh, family, personal...
[58:41.980 --> 58:44.740]  They don't cut corners at Steve's Square Burgers.
[58:45.420 --> 58:49.520]  His wife was Lorraine, uh, they had three more daughters, Pam...
[58:49.520 --> 58:49.880]  Lorraine's.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.820]  Pam, Lori, Molly, and son Kenny.
[58:53.160 --> 58:54.160]  Kenny died in 2013.
[58:55.140 --> 58:57.040]  Kenny's! I would like Kenny's.
[58:57.100 --> 58:58.560]  Pam's, Lori's, Molly's...
[58:58.560 --> 58:59.200]  I'd go to Kenny's.
[58:59.300 --> 58:59.920]  Ah, my butt.
[59:02.460 --> 59:03.260]  Kenny's would be good.
[59:04.640 --> 59:05.720]  I'm a fan of Kenny's.
[59:05.740 --> 59:06.200]  I like Kenny's.
[59:06.200 --> 59:10.920]  Have you... am I the only one? Have you guys ever thought you met a celebrity and then realized
[59:10.920 --> 59:12.160]  it wasn't that celebrity?
[59:14.420 --> 59:17.020]  Uh, ooh, that's a great question.
[59:17.860 --> 59:20.180]  I have another one if you guys need time to think about it.
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.160]  I have a second...
[59:21.160 --> 59:22.480]  I don't think I have one.
[59:22.900 --> 59:26.780]  A guy that, you know, we used to work with at the day job, uh, Bernie, he had a great
[59:26.780 --> 59:32.160]  story about how he called, uh, Nicolas Cage, Nick Nolte in an elevator once and just, like,
[59:32.280 --> 59:33.600]  crushed Nicolas Cage.
[59:34.260 --> 59:35.760]  Uh, but I don't think I have.
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.080]  Oh, man, I hope this is a fart.
[59:38.600 --> 59:39.740]  Oh, I don't... I'm not gonna do it.
[59:39.740 --> 59:41.420]  Yeah, what's your other one, Andrew?
[59:42.260 --> 59:47.660]  I thought I sat behind Ridley Scott at a hockey game once and it wasn't Ridley Scott, but
[59:47.660 --> 59:51.400]  I was, like, behind him and to the left of him so I could only see the side profile of
[59:51.400 --> 59:51.840]  his face.
[59:51.920 --> 59:52.800]  That's a weird one.
[59:52.920 --> 59:55.340]  Like, how many people know what Ridley Scott looks like anyway?
[59:55.860 --> 59:59.220]  I don't know, but I was convinced it was Ridley Scott.
[59:59.460 --> 01:00:03.060]  I was very excited about it and it was at the time where it had just been announced that
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:07.860]  he was going to make a Monopoly movie and I didn't want to just, like, say, hey, are
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.900]  you Ridley Scott or, like, get any attention by him at all?
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:17.000]  So I just spent the majority of the game just making random Ridley Scott, like, you hear
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.340]  about this Monopoly movie that Ridley Scott's gonna make?
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.620]  I think that could be real interesting.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:24.640]  Like, just random quips about Ridley Scott and the films he's worked.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.420]  I, you know, that alien is sure good.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.020]  I'm really hoping that, uh, I don't know, they maybe make another.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:30.900]  I was wrong about that.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.020]  I shouldn't have wanted that.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.540]  But at that time, more alien would be good.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.480]  Yeah, we really didn't need more alien.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.060]  Really?
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.020]  By him, at least.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.540]  Yeah, I don't think any of any of the alien movies he made post.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.680]  I listened to the audio commentary that he did for Alien and, uh, he was describing,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.820]  like, the space jockey and what he thought.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.600]  This was before Prometheus and what he, like, thought that was.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.240]  And he was, like, going through what he thought that story would be.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.960]  Sounded way cooler than the movie that he actually made.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.520]  Do you remember what it was?
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.440]  Oh, it was, like, what was?
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.720]  No, that was a hell of a commentary.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.100]  It was all, like, cut up.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.220]  I think we talked about it.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.100]  There was bits where, like, he was doing the commentary.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.840]  And it's, like, edited between him and other cast members.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.460]  And he's talking to Sigourney Weaver in some parts.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.720]  But then another part, he's, like, kind of, like, joke complaining about the actors.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.440]  And Sigourney Weaver doesn't say anything.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.700]  And I realized that they're from, like, two different commentaries filmed,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.020]  or, like, recorded years apart.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.400]  It's so confusing.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.660]  It's a real good one.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.480]  Is that one of your go-to?
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.040]  Did you listen to a lot of commentary tracks?
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.540]  I mean, that's... what do you mean?
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.960]  Or is that just a thing you listen to, is commentary tracks?
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.140]  Yeah, I listen to them sometimes, yeah.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.080]  There was, like, podcasts for me growing up.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.060]  I loved listening to them.
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.180]  I was very confused.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.400]  I didn't understand the sarcasm of Will Ferrell.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.360]  Or just, like, I didn't really have a concept of who he was as a personality.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.240]  I listened to the Tallagata Nights commentary track as a kid.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.060]  And it's just constantly... it's not, like, any actual commentary.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.960]  It's just jokes from my memory.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.620]  And one of the things in it is, like, yeah, my house is shaped like a NASCAR.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.120]  I'm that much of a NASCAR fan.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.280]  So I thought that Will Ferrell's house was a NASCAR.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.420]  I thought it was shaped that way.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.260]  I had no idea.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.340]  I used to love commentary tracks.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.460]  It's one of the, like, worst parts of streaming for me.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:20.340]  I wish that Netflix or whatever still did commentary tracks as an alternate option.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.720]  I worked once with Jake Scott, which is his son.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.460]  He's as close as I've been to Ridley Scott.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:26.980]  Yeah?
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.420]  Did you ask him about Prometheus?
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:29.940]  Nope.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.280]  I don't think it's been made yet.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.320]  I didn't see that movie.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:32.860]  Not good?
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.020]  It's not worth it, no.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.540]  I don't think you get anything from it.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.800]  It's not canonical to Alien, though, is it?
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.180]  Yes.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.360]  I thought it wasn't.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:41.800]  It's...
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.760]  I thought it was inspired by...
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.340]  No, it's all, like...
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.460]  It's supposed to fit in the universe.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.000]  I think they're all the same universe, yeah.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:46.340]  Is it?
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.060]  Yeah, it's leading into...
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.560]  I think the idea of Prometheus was it would end with the beginning of Alien.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.640]  It would tell that story and then go forward from there.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.960]  But it's the first of a trilogy, right?
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.180]  Originally, yeah, but I feel like the second Alien Covenant or whatever
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.100]  doesn't really have anything to do with Prometheus.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.640]  I mean, Ridley Scott...
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.920]  Yeah, it does. It's like a direct sequel.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.820]  It says, so Ridley Scott has told BBC Radio 5 that his new film Prometheus is not a prequel to it.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.180]  1979 hit Alien.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.520]  I mean, it's set before Alien in the same universe, though.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.620]  And it has a lot of the same imagery.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.060]  I don't feel like Alien Covenant...
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:21.420]  I feel...
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.880]  So, to me, I feel like it was a correction.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:24.920]  Like, I don't...
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.840]  Like, I understand what you're saying.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.640]  There are characters that continue and it is a continuous plot,
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.920]  but I don't feel like that was the story he originally planned on telling at that trilogy.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.440]  If that makes any sense.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.280]  Yeah, I mean, if it was, I don't know why you would want to tell that story.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.320]  Yeah, it's...
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.480]  I've been watching the Halloween movies.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.100]  Yeah.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:43.660]  They're great.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.520]  They're like really bad.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.500]  And then they get...
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.580]  So, the first one, great.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.760]  Two through six, terrible.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.360]  I'm now in the 90s ones.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.080]  Fantastic.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.700]  L, cool, Jay.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:54.620]  He's great.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.540]  Great cast.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.560]  Like, surprisingly good.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.120]  Michelle Williams is in it.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.780]  Josh Hartnett's first movie.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:00.980]  Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:02.480]  Those are fun.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.180]  If you're looking for a random dumb thing to watch, Halloween.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.380]  Yeah, they're...
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.020]  Have you watched them all?
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:09.740]  No, I'm...
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.340]  What's the one?
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:10.840]  I just...
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.480]  I watched Halloween H2O last night.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.400]  So, I'm gonna get the next...
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.080]  The Buster Rhymes one.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.020]  H2O is good.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.880]  And you're watching them in order?
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:18.360]  I am, yes.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.720]  What did you think of Halloween 3?
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.120]  It's a really cool movie.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.520]  I wish that they would have stuck with that instead of...
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.220]  Originally, Michael Myers wasn't gonna be an ongoing character.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.400]  Halloween was gonna be a different story each time.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.020]  It was just gonna be based on it happening on Halloween.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.420]  And then they didn't do that because people were pissed that Michael Myers was in it.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:35.960]  People were angry.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.540]  I wish they would have stuck with that instead of seven Michael Myers movies.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.940]  Paul Rudd also in it.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.340]  It's weird.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.220]  It has a surprisingly good cast for what those movies are.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.040]  All of those horror movies from that era do.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:49.200]  Kevin Bacon is in Friday the 13th.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.060]  And Johnny Depp is in Nightmare on Elm Street.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.900]  Corey Feldman is in Friday the 13th.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.000]  There's a lot of...
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.480]  Corey Feldman is a step back.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.640]  Corey Feldman was phenomenal as a kid actor.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.480]  He was great in that movie.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:01.840]  That's fair.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.980]  It's one of the best horror movies.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.740]  I think it's Friday the 13th.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.200]  Four or five he's in.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:06.860]  Really good.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.540]  I'm disappointed that you guys have never thought you met a celebrity and went through that pain.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.280]  I tend to try to avoid celebrities if I see them.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.360]  That's fair.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.160]  I mean, in the scenarios I'm talking about, I wasn't actively pursuing them.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.140]  I just thought I knew Wendy.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.180]  And then I thought I met Ridley Scott.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.560]  It definitely was Ridley Scott.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.640]  That guy must have been like, why did he spend an hour,
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.760]  or I guess two and a half hours, for a hockey game?
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:36.180]  Do you think that guy even knows who Ridley Scott is?
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.620]  Almost certainly not.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.460]  I agree with Gavin.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.740]  I feel like, well, maybe by name, I guess.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.180]  I could definitely pull Ridley Scott out of a lineup.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.900]  Because, you know, just of the industry I'm in.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.020]  But I feel like most people know the name, not the face.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.620]  I couldn't pull him out of a lineup.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.440]  You don't think so?
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.200]  I can't picture Ridley Scott in my head right now, no.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.880]  He looks kind of like Jake Scott.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.260]  That's fair.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.460]  I think we should probably go because we lost our support staff.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.660]  And I got to go figure out what to do about my butthole.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:08.860]  But before we go, I would like to point out that somebody on one of the comment leavers
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:14.140]  pointed out to me that Mac Jones, who is Gavin's choice to win Rookie of the Year,
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.360]  that we picked for you.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.960]  I didn't realize, and I watched him the entire time he worked,
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.000]  he quarterbacked for Alabama.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.140]  I didn't realize his name is Michael Jones, which is kind of funny.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.620]  And then the Mac comes from his middle name, McCorkle.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.540]  Your pick for Rookie of the Year's name is Michael McCorkle Jones.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.000]  That's a great name.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.720]  Hey, Gavin, do you want to trade Rookie of the Year?
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.600]  Do not do it.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.240]  Do not do it.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.540]  Do you want to trade?
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.320]  You got McCorkle.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.040]  I feel like Macaulay Culkin should call his kid that.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:54.920]  McCorkle Culkin.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.240]  Can we name this episode McCorkle Culkin?
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.540]  I have no idea if this was a good episode or not,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.660]  but if you made it around to the end, I appreciate it.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.920]  Thank you for listening to Episode 72 of F*** Face.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.660]  We will see you next week.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.920]  I don't give a s*** if you rate or review or not.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:21.520]  You do you.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.340]  Bye.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.580]  We're done with this one.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.880]  It just needs to be on the record that if you put your feet in garlic,
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.640]  you're going to taste that garlic.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:56.360]  Is that true?
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.140]  I don't know if it's garlic specific.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.820]  I don't know if you can put like a ham sandwich down there and you taste that,
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.020]  but it's definitely a thing with garlic.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.320]  It has something to do.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.180]  How do you know?
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.960]  Because it's just a fact, Geoff.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.920]  How do you know anything?
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.480]  Where did you read it?
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.640]  Okay, where did you read it?
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.140]  I don't know where I read it, but I know I have.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.380]  Why is he yelling?
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:17.800]  I don't know.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.520]  This is the first time I'm hearing this.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.460]  I wasn't in your fight last time.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.080]  Geoff, you weren't here for this.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.520]  This is the second week in a row.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.820]  Gavin's tried to block the truth about garlic feet.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.720]  Why did you never bring it up in the podcast?
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.080]  Because I forgot!
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.620]  I forgot because we've changed subjects.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.180]  We're talking about baseballs.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.820]  Can Craig cut this out?
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.840]  Can we cut this out anyway?
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.080]  Will Craig record it?
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:40.520]  I mean, yeah.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.260]  I'm still recording.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:42.480]  I'm not recording.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:42.960]  I'll go back.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.460]  I'm not recording.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.560]  I will go back to recording.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.880]  I'm recording again.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.460]  Hold on.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.380]  I'm back to recording.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.900]  So now, do I need to do this again?
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.700]  Do I need to tell the world about how right I am about garlic feet?
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.300]  I just dropped the bottle.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.000]  How do you-
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.780]  Have you tried it?
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:00.860]  No, I haven't tried it.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.740]  I'll gladly try it.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:02.900]  What do you mean?
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.820]  Just because I haven't tried something doesn't mean you don't know it.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.840]  What are you saying?
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.360]  Did you taste the sushi when you were slipping across your floor in the container?
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.220]  There was no sushi in the container!
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.440]  It was a plastic lid!
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:15.600]  It was a plastic lid!
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.080]  I'm gonna google, do feet taste garlic?
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:20.520]  Bing it!
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.320]  Yahoo search it!
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.040]  I don't care!
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.580]  You're gonna find the same result!
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.100]  It's a thing!
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:27.160]  Okay.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.000]  All right.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:28.560]  Read it.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:29.380]  Read it.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.200]  Read it to the people.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:31.460]  I'll read it right now.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.900]  It's not because you have secret garlic taste buds on your feet.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.800]  It's because the molecules responsible for garlic's smell,
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.920]  which is called allicin, A-L-L-I-C-I-N,
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.960]  can penetrate your skin, get into your blood, and travel to your mouth and nose,
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:50.060]  where you suddenly start to sense the taste of garlic.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.680]  It goes in your blood to your nose and mouth?
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.200]  That quickly too, apparently.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.600]  That is... I want to do a blind stomp test.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.900]  And see if Andrew can taste the garlic.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.360]  And we'll get him to stand on three things.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.420]  People put garlic on their feet to treat athlete's foot and to fight fungus.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.180]  And I think that is the best idea you've ever had, Gavin.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.900]  We need a foot taste test.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:20.360]  I like the idea that if I drop the garlic at a restaurant and my steak's a bit plain,
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.360]  I could just take my socks off and stomp on it to get the effect.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.340]  I wonder, oh my god,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.980]  could you eat a plain steak while your foot is in garlic and taste a garlic steak?
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.760]  Do they make garlic like apples?
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.860]  Are there different variations of garlic?
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.560]  Are you asking if you can scrump garlic?
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.220]  No, no, no, no.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.760]  I would never publicly discuss scrumping of any kind.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.040]  But I meant in the sense of there's a Granny Smith.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.000]  There's a Fuji.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:53.680]  There's a Mac.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.940]  There are different variants of garlic in the same way that there are apples.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.460]  There's like elephant garlic, right?
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.800]  I need to get more familiar with garlic and we could do a whole foot garlic test.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.940]  I think I could get good at that.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:05.720]  Like a blindfold.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.300]  Could we do maybe like a what tastes best?
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:13.640]  Like a blind taste test of what your garlic preference is based off of your foot taste.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.340]  You're gonna have to like step on ginger in between to clear your palate.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.780]  That reminds me of another thing I have an issue with.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:31.580]  I have never gone into a grocery store and seen a sign that says these apples are new.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.760]  But they're inventing apples all the time.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.440]  What do you mean?
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:36.880]  I don't know.
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:40.980]  Well, like the apples are constantly being invented.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.380]  They're constantly making new apples.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.300]  But I've never gone into a grocery store and been like this apple just released.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.200]  It just came out.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.340]  You gotta try this apple.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.320]  Like someone's bred a new apple.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:57.180]  Like they don't release like new apples don't drop like albums.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:58.440]  Exactly.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.540]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.200]  And they should.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.260]  They should.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.740]  I feel like people are just like apples.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.420]  People don't realize how recent apples are.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:06.840]  Oh, man.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.280]  I feel like the newest lady.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:08.840]  Let me.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.180]  Is that the newest mainstream apple?
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:10.620]  All right.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:10.880]  Hold on.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:11.600]  I'm going to Google this.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.380]  What's the newest apple?
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.200]  Why does this podcast end?
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:15.700]  I don't know.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.700]  I don't even know where this is.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.180]  Is this a...
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.420]  But this we're making shit.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.680]  Like this has gotta...
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.340]  Why don't we cut all this shit about...
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.600]  Oh, it just gives me new iPhones.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.100]  Come on, man.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:24.980]  I want an apple.
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:26.380]  What is the newest apple?
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.040]  We could cut all the shit about Alien and Prometheus and put this in.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:30.600]  This is better.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:31.940]  It's got...
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:33.200]  Oh, Cosmic Crisp.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.240]  Look at that.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.040]  Cosmic Crisp.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.460]  That sounds delicious.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.380]  That sounds delicious.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.900]  We could call the episode Cosmic Crisp.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320]  When did it come out?
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.060]  When did the Cosmic Crisp release?
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.380]  Yeah, I can tell you.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.980]  Cosmic Crisp is an American apple.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:47.800]  Fuck yeah!
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.000]  Best country in the world!
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.860]  With the variety designation WA38.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:13:00.440]  Breeding began in 1997 at the Washington State University Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.900]  in Wenatchee, Wisconsin...
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.400]  Washington.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.600]  Initially over...
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.000]  Who cares?
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.040]  So, 1997.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.440]  They started waiting...
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.760]  No, no, no, there's more recent apples than that.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.080]  That's when they began.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.800]  That's when breeding began.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.320]  That doesn't necessarily mean that's when they finished it.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.920]  It was first planted for commercial use in the spring of 2017.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:22.320]  See?
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:23.740]  2017.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.660]  We got a new apple within the last five years.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:28.200]  No, that's true.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.680]  I've never gone to a grocery store and seen a sign being like,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.260]  This apple just dropped.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.380]  Come try this apple.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.260]  Hope you ain't more excited about fruit.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.180]  This apple just dropped is great.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.080]  It's amazing.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.980]  It's amazing that we haven't heard more about Cosmic Crisp,
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.540]  which sounds like a weed flavor, by the way.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.740]  Listen to this.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.280]  Promotion and marketing.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:52.500]  A $10 million consumer launch of the product was funded by Washington State Agricultural
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.260]  Promotion Funds through the Washington Apple Commission.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.640]  There is something called the Washington Apple Commission,
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.700]  and they did a $10 million promotional and marketing campaign for the Cosmic Crisp.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.760]  I never fucking heard of it.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.020]  That's crazy, because that's a crowded market, the Apple game.
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.480]  Yeah, Apple games, fucking, it is...
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.640]  It's hard to get in amongst the big dogs.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.880]  I wonder, like, how does that work?
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.580]  Can I go to a grocery store and find a, what was it?
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:24.480]  Oh, Cosmic Crisp, a new Apple launch that lasts for a year.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.600]  That's part of its strength, is that it sits on shelves for a long time.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.580]  Okay, so it doesn't...
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.500]  This sounds like a great Apple.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.420]  It's like, I think we need to try to find a Cosmic Crisp.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.620]  It is a crossbreed of the Honeycrisp and the Enterprise.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.540]  Oh my god, we have gotten really scrump-heavy without even trying.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.680]  We've got, like, a weekly Apple news segment.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.920]  We've become like an Apple podcast.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.560]  This is interesting.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.200]  It's just something I don't understand.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.880]  I feel like there'd be a lot of enthusiasm for a new fruit type.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.140]  That's crazy, though.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.560]  There's a newer Apple than the company.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.760]  That's a newer Apple than the company.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.580]  Yeah, there's so many.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.400]  I feel like Red Delicious came out in, like, 2002, and people love that Apple.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.640]  I wonder if anybody who's a comment leaver or anybody who just listens to this podcast,
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.820]  who wouldn't mind leaving a comment,
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.480]  if any of you work or know somebody who works with the Washington Apple Commission,
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.820]  I would love to know what your job is like.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.660]  Apparently, Cosmic Crisps are shipping nationwide November 8th.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:21.920]  Is it a seasonal Apple?
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.280]  Is it, like, this year?
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.080]  I don't know.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.080]  This upcoming November 8th?
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.760]  Will this be the first run of Cosmic Crisps?
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.500]  Or did they get invented in...
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.120]  We have got...
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.060]  We're following the new ship date of November 8th.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:32.760]  You have got to...
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.440]  Oh, this year!
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.760]  November 8th, 2021!
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.980]  The apples are about to drop!
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.040]  We have a month till Apple 1!
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.020]  Holy shit!
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.380]  I like November.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.580]  November is, like, usually, like, oh, there's a Halo game coming out or something.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:45.940]  Nope!
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.160]  Yeah!
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.800]  Call of Duty and Cosmic Crisps.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.900]  I'm gonna go to my grocery store and see if I can pre-order a Cosmic Crisps.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.920]  If your favorite store doesn't carry Cosmic Crisps,
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.660]  talk to the produce department manager and ask for it by name.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.240]  Can you imagine doing that?
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.020]  Until you just shove it up your ass.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.540]  Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.800]  Guys, we've gotta get...
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.120]  We've gotta get Cosmic Crisps on launch day and film a special video of us eating it.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.880]  This is a big damn deal.
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:12.960]  Oh, this is amazing.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.040]  All right, we should...
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.220]  That's a gorgeous logo.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.680]  We can buy them online!
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:19.980]  Where's the buy apples?
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.640]  Let's see if we can throw it further than your baseball.
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.440]  Oh, I meant to...
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.740]  That's another thing I forgot.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.600]  I'm forgetting all the things I've written down.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:28.900]  No, just one second.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:29.880]  Let me just ask this.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.340]  So, Geoff, you think you could throw a baseball 80 with some training?
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.060]  Yeah, yeah, with some training.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.300]  Eventually, yeah, with some training.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.000]  I understand.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.080]  Not just like you're gonna do it.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.200]  How far do you think you can throw a football?
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.860]  Oh, I have no idea.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.100]  Okay, so you don't...
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.060]  There's no...
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.320]  80 doesn't equal a certain yardage for you?
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:47.220]  No, I'm going for speed, not distance.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:47.880]  I couldn't tell you.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:48.860]  Okay, fair enough.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:49.660]  I just want to ask.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:52.460]  Maybe very far, but I don't even know how far is far on a football.
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.060]  Find apples at your local...
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:54.720]  This is great.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.920]  All right, we gotta stop recording.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.160]  Okay.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.420]  And I don't know...
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.960]  Do we replace the Prometheus?
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.260]  We can replace the butt stuff.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.800]  I don't know what we want to replace.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.380]  Or we could just put this in at the end.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.440]  I just feel like most of the meat of the episode happened after it ended,
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.920]  because we're gonna have a garlic taste test with Andrew.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.000]  And the world is gonna shut the fuck down on November 8th
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.180]  when we celebrate Cosmic Crisp drop date.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.500]  They got juice!
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.520]  They got Cosmic Crisp juice!
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.980]  It's 100% pure pressed apples.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.320]  Wait, is that available now?
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:33.300]  Can I get a little sneak preview of what the apple will taste like?
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.300]  Can I just buy that apple juice now?
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.660]  Apple in liquid form.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.040]  Oh man, this is exciting.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.860]  Oh shit, dude.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.380]  They have lots of products.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:45.460]  They have Cosmic Crisp cider.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.180]  They have an apple spiralizer that's Cosmic Crisp branded.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.180]  That's a little silly.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.980]  Nobody's allowed to get the dried apple slices.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:53.720]  That's a spoiler.
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:54.880]  That's a future spoiler.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.520]  I think you have to stay to juice.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.860]  Liquid versions of it.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.680]  That is true.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:00.920]  We have to stay to juice.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:01.380]  That's it.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:01.750]  We can only...
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.120]  If you want a little taste, you can go with the juice.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.340]  Maybe there's like a live stream launch event that we could host.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.080]  Wow, you can buy 120 apples.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.580]  That would be great.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.360]  That would be great.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.200]  It's Attention Washington Apple Commission.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.120]  We want to host your live stream.
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.520]  We're interested in doing business with you.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.640]  Oh, Gavin, we're fucked.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.700]  There is nothing in our zip code.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.340]  Ah, shit.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.500]  We might have to travel.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:30.940]  Yeah, I'll travel.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.180]  I will absolutely.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.400]  Maybe Andrew will.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.280]  You want to attempt to end this thing for the second time?
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.020]  Oh yeah, let's do it.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.020]  All right, well, the podcast already ended.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:38.640]  So we can just stop.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.100]  The second we stop talking, we're done.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.760]  You don't think the outro should be at the end as well?
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:44.780]  Well, we already did an outro.
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.240]  Can't they just cut it and move it to the...
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:46.860]  Can I...
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.240]  Here's the second...
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.380]  Yeah, oh, please do.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.880]  Can I just say something really quickly?
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.060]  Yeah.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.800]  We asked people to rate and subscribe and all that stuff, you know, at the end,
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.600]  because Eric recommends doing that.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.240]  Well, this week I said do it or don't.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:03.720]  We don't care.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.860]  Yeah, you did say that.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.940]  I just wanted to say we never...
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.200]  I want to thank the people that have.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:08.860]  Oh.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:09.520]  We appreciate it.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.380]  It's very kind of them to either, when they leave a review, drop the five stars.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.940]  It's very considerate.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:15.440]  You know what?
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:16.540]  I'd like to add that.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.840]  I'd like to add on to that, actually.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:24.020]  To all the people out there who have shared this podcast with a friend or loved one,
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:26.120]  I really appreciate that too.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.800]  I was thinking about it the other day in a moment of seriousness.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.160]  This all started...
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.020]  This all came out of the company Rooster Teeth that we started almost 19 years ago.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.880]  And the entire success of our company has been because of word of mouth.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.600]  And I really appreciate people who like our productions enough to share them.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:47.240]  And just know that I'll be eternally grateful if you have done that,
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.180]  or you would consider doing it in the future someday.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.400]  Really appreciate it.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.160]  And some just amazingly sweet people.
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:53.400]  Yeah.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:54.760]  I haven't talked about on the show.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.720]  I've been taking calls from people that listen, just having conversations.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.740]  Amazingly kind comment leaders.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:04.160]  Gavin, do you have anything nice and humane to say?
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.120]  I'm in total agreement.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.480]  I think it's a special thing to be something that people share with other people.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:10.220]  Yeah.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:14.420]  What a rare, beautiful, honest moment from you.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.180]  I appreciate that.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.920]  Doesn't happen often.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:18.520]  All right.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.920]  And now I gotta go find something better to stick up my ass.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.220]  I'll see you guys later.
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:23.960]  All right, bye.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.360]  Bye.
