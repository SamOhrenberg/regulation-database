[00:37.320 --> 00:43.220]  So I'm just there, uh, cock in hand, calling the police because someone's looking at me.
[00:44.240 --> 00:45.200]  Well, no, I don't...
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.100]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:50.620 --> 00:51.860]  You want to start it there?
[00:52.380 --> 00:52.800]  Sure.
[00:53.420 --> 00:58.320]  Well, wait, Gavin's saying... editor, can you please start it with... the episode starts
[00:58.320 --> 01:02.880]  with Gavin saying, so I'm just standing there with cock in hand calling the police.
[01:02.880 --> 01:04.580]  And that's the beginning of the episode.
[01:07.280 --> 01:11.880]  Um, yeah, I guess without context, that's interesting. It's definitely an interesting
[01:11.880 --> 01:12.320]  sentence.
[01:12.740 --> 01:14.980]  So, Gavin, you were saying you had your cock in your hand,
[01:15.060 --> 01:16.880]  you were on the phone with the cops, you were in your yard.
[01:18.600 --> 01:18.920]  Continue.
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.520]  Um, and then the little boy went to sleep. That was the end of the fairy tale.
[01:25.960 --> 01:27.060]  Why'd you have to make it about kids?
[01:27.220 --> 01:30.360]  Well, yeah, I was gonna make it fictional, but it really went to kids.
[01:30.360 --> 01:34.460]  You pivoted it to the worst possible place. You made it way worse.
[01:34.660 --> 01:37.640]  That might have been the worst pivot possible.
[01:37.740 --> 01:39.720]  Oh, it was by far the worst.
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.420]  I think you may have pivoted us into a new start of the episode.
[01:45.780 --> 01:50.340]  Can I just... I'll pivot to just a description. We're talking about if you're pissing in your
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.080]  yard, and if somebody sees, is that indecent exposure? I don't think it is. You're in the
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.080]  privacy of your own backyard.
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.520]  Yeah, so I was, I was saying that surely if my knob is out in view of other people's
[02:00.520 --> 02:06.400]  homes, that's still indecent exposure. And Andrew was saying that it would be only weird
[02:06.400 --> 02:10.120]  if they kept looking. So I thought, well, are they in the wrong?
[02:10.540 --> 02:13.940]  I just, I don't know the rules of that because you're in your own space. I think it's different.
[02:14.080 --> 02:19.460]  Let's say if you built like a seven foot wooden platform, stood on top of it, and then was just
[02:19.460 --> 02:22.980]  doing whatever you want to do up there. I think that's a different conversation. But if you're
[02:22.980 --> 02:26.840]  on ground level in your yard. You're saying it's an altitude thing.
[02:27.220 --> 02:33.220]  I think so. Well, if you are, if you are presenting yourself beyond the fence, I think if you've
[02:33.220 --> 02:38.360]  elevated above the fence would be my rule of thumb, then it's an issue. Then you got
[02:38.360 --> 02:41.740]  a problem. But as long as you're touching the ground, I think you're all good.
[02:42.340 --> 02:45.840]  All right, here we go. Here we go. Anything to do with it. Here we go. I looked it up.
[02:46.140 --> 02:49.780]  So this is only, this is only for the state of Texas. So it may be different in England
[02:49.780 --> 02:56.680]  and in Canada or the other 49 states in America. You may be charged with indecent exposure in Texas
[02:56.680 --> 03:00.860]  if you expose your naked body to the public while on your private property.
[03:01.280 --> 03:04.400]  Okay. I was wrong. Right. So the public, so public being
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.380]  potentially just a public place outside. But what if it's private property to private property?
[03:09.380 --> 03:15.100]  Well, it says if you expose, oh, to the, well, so you're saying you on your private property
[03:15.100 --> 03:18.120]  expose yourself to someone on their private property.
[03:18.120 --> 03:21.380]  Basically, like I can understand if I'm in my front doorway.
[03:21.800 --> 03:29.980]  I think the public in this instance probably refers to anyone who isn't living on your property.
[03:30.580 --> 03:33.460]  Okay. Would be, I would guess that would be like the legal definition.
[03:33.980 --> 03:38.140]  That's what I would have guessed. Yeah. Oh my God. I closed that window. And you know,
[03:38.180 --> 03:43.320]  what was the previous window? Cosmic crisps. I reached out to them yesterday.
[03:43.740 --> 03:46.440]  Oh yeah. Yeah. I hope we get a reply. I reached out.
[03:46.440 --> 03:49.940]  November 8th, baby. Very exciting. I have another...
[03:49.940 --> 03:52.940]  New Apple drops. I have a question.
[03:53.540 --> 03:57.720]  Kind of about U.S. law. I was curious about that. Well, it's kind of a strangely specific question.
[03:58.120 --> 04:01.320]  I'm watching the Halloween movies. I think I've mentioned that before.
[04:01.680 --> 04:07.880]  And I just watched Halloween Resurrection, which is a movie all about Michael Myers is in his house.
[04:08.240 --> 04:11.840]  And then they go to the Michael Myers home and then he kills a bunch of people.
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.400]  Is it, does he do anything illegal technically in that movie? In certain states?
[04:17.420 --> 04:19.920]  Because they're all trespassing? Yeah, because they're all trespassing.
[04:20.060 --> 04:24.840]  I was curious if technically Michael Myers is completely legal in all of his action.
[04:25.100 --> 04:29.900]  I think it depends on what state he's in. That's great. I think Illinois, right?
[04:30.100 --> 04:34.880]  Illinois. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what the standard ground laws are in Illinois, but yeah.
[04:35.340 --> 04:38.760]  As is watching, I think this is very odd. I think that might be,
[04:38.760 --> 04:43.920]  because what comes after Halloween Resurrection? They reboot it with the Rob Zombie Halloween.
[04:44.440 --> 04:48.620]  Right. So that's probably why there was a reboot is he was innocent.
[04:49.340 --> 04:54.080]  And they were like, we can't, we can't prosecute this guy for defending his home territory.
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.220]  So as a property, so we'll have to reboot the series and we'll bring in a heavy hitter like Rob
[04:58.220 --> 05:03.500]  fucking zombie. Well, when you bring in somebody like Busta Rhymes into your universe, you have to
[05:03.500 --> 05:08.740]  start over if you can't bring it back. You need a palate cleanser. I don't know, but Busta Rhymes
[05:08.740 --> 05:12.700]  was the best part of that movie by far. He was pretty great. He was pretty great. Have you seen
[05:12.700 --> 05:16.680]  Halloween Resurrection, Gavin? No, I've never, I don't think I've ever seen anything apart from
[05:16.680 --> 05:21.920]  the first one. There's a scene where Busta Rhymes dresses up as Michael Myers and Michael Myers
[05:21.920 --> 05:27.260]  starts following him as Michael Myers. And then he turns around and he thinks that somebody else
[05:27.260 --> 05:31.680]  dressed as Michael Myers. He's like, what are you doing here? I'm the Michael Myers of this show.
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.760]  What are you doing? Get out of here. Skedaddle Michael Myers, skedaddle, get out of here.
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.780]  And Michael Myers just like turns around and walks away. It's great. Busta Rhymes is the
[05:39.780 --> 05:48.060]  only good thing about that movie. It's fantastic. Oh, so did we start the episode? Yeah. No, I feel
[05:48.060 --> 05:53.020]  like we're well in at this point, Gavin. It's the worst thing you could possibly say. 73, I believe.
[05:53.720 --> 05:58.700]  73. I was talking to Andrew a little bit before we started, Gavin, before you showed up early,
[05:58.820 --> 06:04.380]  which was shocking. By the way, let this be known, episode 73, I think is the first episode
[06:04.380 --> 06:08.720]  you've ever shown up early for. I don't know if that's true. I don't think that's true. I think
[06:08.720 --> 06:12.820]  it's the second. Second episode you've ever showed up early for. Not sure how I feel about it, to be
[06:12.820 --> 06:17.740]  honest with you. I feel like the six minutes leading up to the episode is my safe space with
[06:17.740 --> 06:24.660]  Andrew to talk about you. Yeah, I think I was about five or six minutes early. I just wanted
[06:24.660 --> 06:34.100]  to get my tools ready. No, I hear you. We got a lot to talk about today. First off, Gavin got a
[06:34.100 --> 06:40.640]  baseball throw. We need to deal with that. Oh, shit. There's a timeline that we need to lay out.
[06:40.840 --> 06:44.860]  What do you mean, a timeline? I would just say, Andrew, don't get your hopes up.
[06:45.160 --> 06:50.980]  Oh, I'm fucking... he's jeffing this, isn't he? No, no, Gavin, please, you have to support me here.
[06:52.700 --> 06:57.320]  What are you... what have you done? We're extenuating circumstances. Oh, fuck you.
[06:58.200 --> 07:03.900]  I would say he's jeffing it, but it's out of his hands. Okay. Thank you. I would like to talk
[07:03.900 --> 07:08.400]  about how, you know, the first off, I don't know if we covered it in an episode. I don't think we
[07:08.400 --> 07:12.920]  did, because I don't think it happened yet. But the baseball knobs sold out in an hour and nine
[07:12.920 --> 07:18.380]  minutes, which was phenomenal. The hell's a baseball knob? Baseball bat knob. Sorry. Because
[07:18.380 --> 07:24.260]  I'm getting ahead of myself. The baseball bat knobs, we sold a thousand of them in about an
[07:24.260 --> 07:31.320]  hour and nine minutes. So thank you so much for supporting such a dumb idea. Put a lot of love
[07:31.320 --> 07:37.720]  and effort into it. They ruined the comfort of my home for a good couple... most of the summer,
[07:38.060 --> 07:43.220]  as I had to move them around from room to room to get anywhere. And I'm pretty sure it put a
[07:43.220 --> 07:47.020]  strain on the relationship that I didn't realize at the time between my girlfriend and I. But things
[07:47.020 --> 07:51.940]  have been better since the bat knobs are gone. I'll say that. Anyway, so overwhelmed with the
[07:51.940 --> 07:57.140]  support. And we wanted to come up with what to do next. We talked about a thousand baseballs.
[07:57.200 --> 08:00.520]  And I had... I was actually talking about with Emily at lunch the other day. I think we landed
[08:00.520 --> 08:05.980]  on a great way to figure out how to sign and not sign some of the balls. So let me... let me... I've
[08:05.980 --> 08:09.040]  already talked about this with Gavin. But let me present it to you, Andrew. Okay, but before you
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.740]  do, can I just put a last... the last pile of dirt on the knobs? The last comment about the knob and
[08:14.740 --> 08:20.140]  the bat situation? Yeah. I ordered one. Haven't got mine yet. My confusion... I've said multiple
[08:20.140 --> 08:26.080]  times. I'm still kind of confused about part of it. So we just... there's a hundred... you sought
[08:26.080 --> 08:32.920]  off a hundred knobs from full-size bats. And the bat ends had the logo on it. And we sent out a
[08:32.920 --> 08:38.400]  hundred random bat ends, right? With the knobs? Like a hundred random people got them? Is that correct?
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.700]  Okay. Continue your story. Well, I'm just... I'm just confirming. That was the thing. A hundred random
[08:43.700 --> 08:48.080]  people got full bats, right? I don't know if it was a hundred random or the first hundred to order.
[08:48.220 --> 08:52.480]  I'm not sure. But I don't have anybody from the store here to ask. Okay, whatever. A hundred people
[08:52.480 --> 08:59.420]  got bats. I don't understand. So when we started, we're like, why don't we sell full bats? Wait, wait.
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.920]  They got their own bat piece for their own knob? I don't think so. I don't... I don't... Did they? I think
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.860]  so, yeah. I don't know. We'll have to... We're still confused. We're confused on a whole other level.
[09:10.220 --> 09:14.440]  I just don't under... Go ahead. What are you gonna say? We're gonna have to feed the whole purpose about trying to find
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.220]  your bat end? I don't know if that was even a part of it. My confusion was that we were gonna sell
[09:19.220 --> 09:25.200]  full bats. And we were... It was like, oh, we can't do that logistical nightmare. Not the... It's just
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.920]  complicated. But we've sold full bats that were just in two pieces. And one piece is only like two inches off
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.680]  the bottom. So I don't understand. That's why we sold mini bats. It's because full bats would have been...
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.880]  Yeah, well, yeah. Because it turns out a full bat is two inches too big. So we had to cut them to make
[09:41.880 --> 09:50.280]  boxes. So yeah. Fair enough. I just was confused. Yeah, no. Initially, when we looked into it, it
[09:50.280 --> 09:56.520]  looked like it was going to be difficult to sell a full bat and ship it. But as we perfected and
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.920]  went through the process painstakingly over months and months and months, they were able to work out
[10:00.920 --> 10:06.820]  a solution to ship. I'm happy they did. Wait, so originally, we didn't sell a full bat because we
[10:06.820 --> 10:11.860]  thought it was going to be too difficult. So we sold a tiny bat. Then we found out you could. I'll
[10:11.860 --> 10:17.860]  be honest. And then we still didn't. I'll be honest. I don't remember why we did or didn't. I don't remember
[10:17.860 --> 10:23.100]  if I was wanting to sell a full bat. No, we talked about it. It was like, they're like posters. Can't do it.
[10:23.260 --> 10:29.240]  I just remember wanting to do something after manually burning in the numbers and all the
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.980]  bats. I wanted to manipulate the next product in some way and to continue that
[10:33.980 --> 10:40.780]  lineage, which is where I'm going. I love that you love the bat knob, Andrew. I love that you
[10:40.780 --> 10:46.520]  registered your confusion. It is officially on the books. It's a regulation registration.
[10:47.220 --> 10:51.820]  So that's there forever. It's there. It's in. It's entered in. So we have that. Thank you.
[10:52.100 --> 10:58.420]  But I would like to move on from the past, the highly successful thousand bat knob run past to
[10:58.420 --> 11:03.460]  talk about a thousand baseballs. We talked about taking a thousand baseballs, putting a base logo
[11:03.460 --> 11:08.000]  on them. And then we joked around about if I could hit it, like I could swing at a thousand baseballs,
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.340]  how many would I hit or not? Maybe the ones that I hit, we could sell. The ones that I don't hit,
[11:12.640 --> 11:18.060]  we could sell as on a different tier. And the ones that I swing and miss on, if there are any,
[11:18.180 --> 11:22.420]  if there are any that I miss, those would be sold at a different rate, right? So then
[11:23.240 --> 11:26.620]  having a lunch brainstorming came up with this idea. Credit goes to Emily for helping me come
[11:26.620 --> 11:31.380]  up with it. What if I take the, I already have all this equipment, right? I saved four or five
[11:31.380 --> 11:37.040]  full size baseball bats. They're my spare bedroom. So I can take the full size baseball bats. Then I
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.200]  can take the wood burning kit that I have, and I can autograph my name deeply into the barrel
[11:42.200 --> 11:48.560]  over and over again, kind of all over, like maybe put like 20 autographs all over the bat barrel,
[11:48.680 --> 11:54.100]  right? Where you connect to the ball. Then we get a big bucket of ink or paint, okay? And we stand
[11:54.100 --> 12:01.680]  it next to a home plate in a batter's box. And then we put all, we load a thousand baseballs
[12:01.680 --> 12:07.580]  into the pitching machine. Then I dip the bat into the ink or paint, and then I swing at a
[12:07.580 --> 12:13.740]  ball. And when I connect with the ball, the paint that has now gotten into the grooves of the
[12:13.740 --> 12:20.740]  baseball bat, of my signature, connects with the ball and it stamps my signature on the ball. And
[12:20.740 --> 12:25.060]  that's how we autograph a thousand baseballs. I love this idea. I think it's a fantastic idea.
[12:25.060 --> 12:30.140]  I think it's the best idea ever. I think it's a great idea, but I think that it should be like a
[12:30.140 --> 12:34.220]  blind box situation where you, they're all the same price, but you don't know whether you'll get
[12:34.220 --> 12:38.460]  a hit or not. Okay. I'm fine with that too. I'm fine with that too. I don't, I don't care how we
[12:38.460 --> 12:43.460]  portion it out. I just want to, I just want to do it. And I mean, I suspect it'll be interesting
[12:43.460 --> 12:51.280]  because if I, out of, out of a thousand swings, I may hit 900 balls. So it may be rarer not to get
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.700]  an autograph in this situation than to get one. I was going the other way. I was immediately
[12:55.700 --> 13:00.800]  thinking with Gavin's idea, I think the concern is we might be greatly overestimating how many
[13:00.800 --> 13:07.800]  balls you could hit. There might only be like 85 balls with autographs. So, uh, anyway, I'm,
[13:07.800 --> 13:11.960]  I'm excited about getting, jumping into that, uh, and hitting a thousand balls and all that,
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.260]  but I want to get the ball throw out of the way first. So I want to talk about a timeline.
[13:18.320 --> 13:23.140]  Uh, and, and unfortunately that's been pushed back just a teeny bit because of some,
[13:23.140 --> 13:29.360]  because of some issues. Okay. Should we get straight into your issues? Yeah. Okay. Well,
[13:29.940 --> 13:35.980]  let me preface by saying, uh, I went to a party on Saturday. Oh no. A daytime yard party, right?
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.760]  Uh, Fred, it was lovely. I hadn't been in a backyard like garden party and since before
[13:41.760 --> 13:47.760]  COVID, it was amazing. I had a lovely time. Uh, I got to speak to some interesting people,
[13:47.940 --> 13:51.100]  catch up with some old friends, nothing, none of it related to the day job,
[13:51.100 --> 13:56.260]  outsider work stuff. It was really great. Uh, however, uh, in the process I was talking to
[13:56.260 --> 14:01.780]  another friend of mine who was explaining that he, uh, for like two years had had what he thought
[14:01.780 --> 14:08.460]  was like a, a pulled muscle on his groin, kind of like near his hip. And, uh, it just would like
[14:08.460 --> 14:12.300]  never heal or heal for a couple of weeks and then he would re pull it. And then, and eventually he
[14:12.300 --> 14:16.180]  just got so frustrated with it. He mentioned it to a doctor when he was like getting a physical
[14:16.180 --> 14:20.440]  and the doctor was like, Oh, you probably have a groinal hernia. And he was like, yeah, most people
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.200]  think of hernias as like, you get that like bulge when your intestines are poking out or whatever,
[14:24.700 --> 14:30.820]  but a groinal hernia, they don't poke out. It's just like a muscle tear. And so he, uh, he had
[14:30.820 --> 14:35.440]  a CT scan and he found out he had one and he, uh, he got it sewn up and now he's on the mend, right?
[14:36.700 --> 14:41.660]  So as he was explaining that to me, I was realizing that what he's describing, I live with,
[14:41.780 --> 14:48.860]  I've lived with for probably six years. Uh, I have a thing that is, I have a pulled muscle and like
[14:48.860 --> 14:53.300]  to the left, like kind of under my, I don't know, like where your leg creases kind of on my left
[14:53.300 --> 14:59.060]  leg that, uh, is like a pulled muscle that never quite heals and comes and goes and feels wrong.
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.920]  Like it feels different than a pulled muscle and it's fucking, it drives me nuts. And I always just
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.160]  think I'm a wimp, right? So that was thinking before I throw this fucking baseball, maybe I
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.080]  should go to the doctor and make sure I don't have a hernia because I don't want to, I don't want to
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.160]  cause any additional damage because I'm about to go through some serious, serious training regimen.
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.080]  I have tools, I have supply. I went to the fucking sports store. My trunk is full of shit,
[15:24.480 --> 15:29.820]  uh, so that I can begin this process. So I just need to go to the doctor. As of Saturday,
[15:29.900 --> 15:34.640]  I just needed to go to the doctor, uh, just bounce this off him. He could say, no idiot, it's,
[15:34.740 --> 15:38.780]  there's no way you have a hernia. Go home. You're fine. Throw your baseball. Or you could say,
[15:38.800 --> 15:43.240]  let's get a CT scan and see, oh, you do have a hernia. You probably rip your leg off. If you
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.180]  threw this baseball 80 miles an hour, let's patch that up for a couple, you take a month off and
[15:47.180 --> 15:52.620]  you're ready to go. Right? I, I, I, I'm desperate to complete this challenge because I know I can
[15:52.620 --> 15:58.260]  do it. I just have to set myself up for success. Okay. After that, that little bit of knowledge,
[15:58.320 --> 16:01.700]  which in my head, I think, all right, this is pushing, this is pushing the baseball down a
[16:01.700 --> 16:06.060]  little, down the road a little bit, but not too much. Andrew will understand. Then I was feeling
[16:06.060 --> 16:10.300]  great, Andrew. I was feeling on top of the world. Uh, Saturday night, I decided to play tennis.
[16:10.660 --> 16:14.080]  So, uh, Emily and Millie and I, we went out, we played, we played tennis from like eight to 10
[16:14.080 --> 16:18.640]  on Saturday night, like with the lights on at the park. It was fucking cool. Uh, felt awesome.
[16:18.760 --> 16:24.900]  Sunday, got up, went on a 22 mile bike ride. The weather was beautiful. I could go at my own speed
[16:24.900 --> 16:30.320]  because I wasn't dragging Gavin or Trevor behind me. It was super easy. Uh, it was just, it was
[16:30.320 --> 16:36.620]  perfect. I came home. I'm telling you, I was on top of the world. I felt like I was 25 years old
[16:36.620 --> 16:43.280]  again, Andrew. I was full of sun. My body was lean and exercised. I was full of that, that post-workout
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.680]  energy. I looked at the backyard and I thought, I'm going to cut this fucking grass today. That's
[16:47.680 --> 16:50.820]  what I'm going to do. I'm going to be, I had fun this morning. I'm going to be productive this
[16:50.820 --> 16:55.640]  afternoon. And I walked into the house, I walked into the bedroom and I saw some laundry on the,
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.920]  on the sofa in the bedroom. And I said, uh, oh, before I cut the grass, why don't I put that
[17:00.920 --> 17:06.340]  folded laundry away and be doubly productive? Because I'm in such a good mood. I'm doing house
[17:06.340 --> 17:11.840]  chores. Just, sorry, quick pause. Is this related to the, to the photo of laundry that we saw? Or
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.080]  is this a separate? That's just, that's the photo. That's the photo. Yeah. Okay. Emily
[17:16.080 --> 17:18.840]  sent you guys a picture of laundry. What do you think happened, Andrew?
[17:21.780 --> 17:26.780]  I don't know at this point. It's clearly Geoff got injured somehow trying to fold laundry.
[17:26.940 --> 17:32.480]  It sounds like. I will say it's very funny because you went on a list of like every sporting event
[17:32.480 --> 17:36.500]  a human could do. You're like, I did this. I did that. I did that. I kept waiting for the injury
[17:36.500 --> 17:40.320]  to happen. If you're going to tell me that it happened on a folding laundry incident.
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.960]  I didn't fold this laundry, Andrew. Okay. You're just grabbing. I wasn't the one to
[17:44.960 --> 17:50.280]  hold it. Yeah. It was, uh, I believe it was two pairs of pants, uh, girl pants. So they're
[17:50.280 --> 17:54.340]  smaller as my girlfriend's pants, not mine. And two, two or three of her t-shirts all folded up.
[17:54.400 --> 18:00.320]  And I just bent over to pick it up. And the second I, I, I reached my destination, my hands
[18:00.320 --> 18:06.120]  reached that, uh, that, that little pile of laundry, I realized I would never be able to stand
[18:06.120 --> 18:16.880]  again. My back in that moment broke in half. Oh no. I've never felt a pain like that. Like the
[18:16.880 --> 18:23.260]  muscle pull. Emily was on the phone with her parents having like a Sunday, like Sunday call.
[18:23.800 --> 18:33.540]  And I went, and I just, I just collapsed and I became instantly bedridden. And I,
[18:33.540 --> 18:37.820]  I just got out of bed yesterday. Yesterday was my Wednesday was my first day out of bed.
[18:38.340 --> 18:42.320]  I, for the first day, I showed it to Gavin and Meg. I, uh, cause they came over for Survivor
[18:42.320 --> 18:48.340]  last night. I had to have a chair next to the bed so that I could stand up and then push the chair.
[18:48.700 --> 18:53.480]  Like, like old people walkers, I could push the chair just to the toilet so I could pee in back.
[18:53.600 --> 18:59.140]  And that process half an hour, half an hour to pee easily and excruciatingly painful. I have
[18:59.140 --> 19:04.940]  sneezed more this week. And then in my entire life, each, each sneeze is like getting punt.
[19:05.020 --> 19:08.740]  It's like getting, it's like Bane snapping Batman's back in half. That's what it feels
[19:08.740 --> 19:15.900]  like to sneeze. It has been brutal. Brutal. I tell you, I have been, I'm sitting in a special chair
[19:15.900 --> 19:19.660]  is the only way I can sit up in my house. So I'm looking up at my computer, like a little,
[19:19.780 --> 19:25.540]  like, like I'm a fucking toddler as it's so far above me. It, I, I cannot tell you the hell
[19:25.540 --> 19:30.440]  that I have been in since Sunday afternoon. You do not need to explain that. You're forgetting,
[19:30.540 --> 19:35.480]  you're talking to the man with the worst ankles possibly on the planet. I understand the pain.
[19:36.100 --> 19:40.320]  Yeah. I get it. Meg and I were over last night and, uh, we were, we always try to,
[19:40.420 --> 19:45.260]  because Survivor is always the day before we record F*** Face. We always try and avoid anything
[19:45.260 --> 19:49.640]  that might be mentioned on F*** Face. But we, I had that picture that he sent both of us.
[19:49.640 --> 19:57.340]  And, um, he was moving real slow. He was sort of hobbling around between rooms and I was like,
[19:57.880 --> 20:01.980]  wait, are you injured? And he would just like, I don't want to talk about it.
[20:03.900 --> 20:08.960]  I held off for as long as I could. He wasn't like the, the speed of a 90 year old. It was,
[20:09.400 --> 20:11.520]  but also trying to play it off like he wasn't that injured.
[20:12.920 --> 20:18.000]  So bad. And then, and then he pulled the photo up and he and Meg started trying to guess it. And so
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.540]  eventually it came out, but yeah. Cause I, I immediately saw the laundry and I thought,
[20:22.660 --> 20:28.420]  well, Geoff has shit all those clothes. I didn't know an injury was even a factor. I could just
[20:28.420 --> 20:35.140]  see him moving around. I was like, Oh, yeah, an absolute. How did Geoff shit on this pile of
[20:35.140 --> 20:40.380]  clothing? What did he do to destroy it? Did he drop another like smoothie bomb and it went all
[20:40.380 --> 20:49.760]  over the clothes? How did he shit his jeans and his shirt and his socks? Oh my God, guys. I'm,
[20:50.120 --> 20:57.460]  I moved my toaster last week and I cleaned up more smoothie. Wow. It was behind the toaster
[20:57.460 --> 21:02.980]  somehow. So I need to, I need to just double check. I may have missed this. Did you not have
[21:02.980 --> 21:08.500]  a shoulder issue? Was that just what, what was that? What shoulder issue? The whole, the whole,
[21:08.500 --> 21:13.940]  you opened this whole story about how you talked to a guy that had a thing wrong with his hip and
[21:13.940 --> 21:19.060]  it turned out to be an issue. Oh, a hernia. Yeah. I don't know. I got, so I just, this is where I am
[21:19.060 --> 21:24.080]  in the timeline. I have to get back to where I can leave the house again, like mobile and move
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.280]  around and stuff. And when I do that, like when I'm capable of leaving the house, I will then go
[21:29.280 --> 21:34.520]  to the doctor, get this hernia thing checked out. Once I get the AOK from the doctor, then I'm gonna
[21:34.520 --> 21:39.240]  throw a fucking baseball. Jack just asked me today, he was like, would you be willing to do
[21:39.240 --> 21:44.140]  your first baseball throw on extra life as like a charity thing? So I was going to talk that over
[21:44.140 --> 21:51.060]  with you guys and see if you want to allow minor league fan Jack to co-opt our silly thing for
[21:51.060 --> 21:55.800]  the greater good, or if we should tell him to go suck eggs. But anyway, I just wanted to give you
[21:55.800 --> 21:58.820]  a heads up. That's why I haven't thrown the ball yet. It's because I just have to get through
[21:58.820 --> 22:05.880]  these minor setbacks so that I can throw the ball healthy, so that then I can have my three
[22:05.880 --> 22:11.900]  months to, if I need it, to get to 80 miles an hour. And then it's fucking, then I'm teeing off
[22:11.900 --> 22:18.840]  on the baseballs. Boom, signature. Boom, signature. Boom, signature. Should we have a wall behind you
[22:18.840 --> 22:24.860]  for all of the strikes with also some like different colored ink? So like a canvas? Yeah, it just says
[22:24.860 --> 22:33.560]  Loser stamped onto it, so the ball hit there. I have complete sympathy for your situation,
[22:33.740 --> 22:38.840]  Geoff. I hope your back gets better soon. I hope it's not a long-term injury. I will say though,
[22:38.900 --> 22:44.200]  and I just want to throw this out there, I feel like you coin-storied us again. I really feel
[22:44.200 --> 22:49.080]  like that you just did another version of the coin story, the sock thing. I think you just did
[22:49.080 --> 22:53.940]  that twice. Well, I feel like the buildup was necessary because he did all this other stuff
[22:53.940 --> 22:59.420]  in the day that wasn't, you know, that was way more intensive than laundry picking. We learned
[22:59.420 --> 23:04.620]  a thing about him that had nothing ultimately to do with the point of his story. And it just,
[23:04.760 --> 23:09.980]  if anything, was like a fake tease. No, no, everything I told you, everything I told you
[23:09.980 --> 23:14.840]  is germane to my ability to throw this ball. If I have a hernia, I gotta get that fixed before
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.660]  I can throw the ball. But if I don't have a hernia, then we're fine. But that's unrelated
[23:19.660 --> 23:24.700]  to what's currently happening. You can't go through. Correct. It's a cascading series of
[23:24.700 --> 23:27.980]  events. Well, because it's something that we got to deal with between now and the ball.
[23:28.140 --> 23:33.380]  Because now that I know about the possibility of a groinal hernia, I have to investigate it.
[23:33.720 --> 23:37.500]  It has to be dealt with before I can throw the ball. So I don't want to throw,
[23:39.040 --> 23:44.820]  pardon the reference, but I don't want to throw a curveball in the 11th hour when you're not
[23:44.820 --> 23:48.500]  expecting it and be like, oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you because I don't want to pile on
[23:48.500 --> 23:53.300]  because I didn't think it was necessary to the laundry story that I also have a hernia
[23:53.300 --> 23:57.220]  like three weeks from now or some shit. I want I want to give you all the information I have as
[23:57.220 --> 24:03.120]  I have it. OK, so this is you're saying there are no other possible issues. This is it. This is you
[24:03.120 --> 24:09.080]  wanted it all at one time. The hurdles are your back and you might have a hernia. But the other
[24:09.080 --> 24:14.240]  the other potential issue, but I'm dealing with it and I won't let it be a problem because I have
[24:14.240 --> 24:19.540]  I have seemed to have developed a pretty since pretty severe case of tennis elbow
[24:20.120 --> 24:26.900]  from my tennis lessons. But I bought a I bought my throwing arm, but I bought a compression sleeve.
[24:27.080 --> 24:34.300]  So I'm not going to worry about it. I think, OK, there's no way you're throwing 80 regardless.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.460]  I got this. I got this. We just got to get through these minor health hiccups.
[24:39.660 --> 24:44.040]  So make sure that I'm in fucking fit as a fiddle. And then I'm going to start
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.580]  throwing the heat. You're going to be the first person to end up in a full body cast from throwing.
[24:48.880 --> 24:59.120]  I don't think you should try. I just I just have to do it in a way that's
[24:59.120 --> 25:07.880]  not going to snap my back in half. Oh, wow. OK, we have no idea when your back will heal.
[25:07.920 --> 25:11.540]  Hopefully soon. Hope it's quick. Then I fucking hope so, dude, because I'm
[25:11.540 --> 25:14.000]  I'm out of town next week to go ride roller coasters.
[25:14.280 --> 25:21.300]  I hope I can do that. Also, I can't record next week, but I assume everybody knew that.
[25:21.700 --> 25:27.780]  OK, anyway, that was my that was my small update on where the ball is in progress.
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.340]  Still in progress. Never stop being in progress. I assumed in progress going to be even longer with
[25:33.340 --> 25:38.480]  the injury. I still I don't think I don't think I'm going to guess you throw 50 and I don't think
[25:38.480 --> 25:44.940]  you get above 65. And I assume that you're going to blame the ball. That's my ultimate guess for all
[25:44.940 --> 25:48.820]  this stuff. You're going to go through all the fucking medical exams you're going through.
[25:48.920 --> 25:52.180]  It's like you're going to space the amount of training you're going through this. And then
[25:52.180 --> 25:56.300]  you're just going to be like the balls off and then just deny. We'll be delaying for the weather
[25:56.300 --> 26:00.960]  a few times. Absolutely. If you two are going to be at the same place for it, we're never going to
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.880]  get it done. You guys got to do it independently. This motherfucker, he continues to be just an
[26:06.880 --> 26:13.800]  albatross around the neck of a good time. Let me tell you, fucking last night, we're watching
[26:13.800 --> 26:20.440]  Survivor. Everything's fine. Everything's going a-okay. We're like, I don't know, four-fifths of
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.460]  the way through the show. And Gavin goes, eh, no power went out. Uh, Hulu seems to be working. Uh,
[26:26.880 --> 26:30.700]  nothing got in the way of us watching the episode. And Meg looked at him and goes, you fucking
[26:30.700 --> 26:35.120]  asshole. You just jinxed us. He's like, ah, that's blah blah blah blah. British, that's not real.
[26:35.120 --> 26:41.240]  Whatever dumb shit he said. About two minutes later in Tribal Council, fucking boom! In the
[26:41.240 --> 26:49.340]  middle of Tribal Council, fucking Halo Hulu goes out. Comes back, goes down again. Everyone was
[26:49.340 --> 26:57.660]  extremely mad at me. And I feel like I was only 40% to blame. Goddamn, dude. Why did you say that?
[26:59.620 --> 27:03.660]  I can't, I'm just, I'm still sad. I'm still disappointed about the outcome.
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.420]  I don't know if spoilers or not or whatever, I'm not going to say the person, but I feel like it
[27:08.420 --> 27:15.100]  was a devastating loss to the season. I think he's the person I want to vote out. I truly believe
[27:15.100 --> 27:20.200]  it. I was so excited every week to hear a different take on Broccoli and how he fumbles it, but.
[27:22.120 --> 27:29.980]  He was, he was my pick to win. I love how he's self-aware about that too. Yeah, that's great.
[27:29.980 --> 27:36.960]  I really fucking sucked at that. Yeah. I didn't like how I said it. I assumed that he would like
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.120]  go over to the guy and be all private about it. I didn't expect him to just fucking declare on
[27:41.120 --> 27:45.060]  the mat. I don't think that's a rule. I don't think they have to do it in that context. Cause
[27:45.060 --> 27:49.640]  then he walked over, I was like, I just flubbed that. Like, I don't think you need to. I think
[27:49.640 --> 27:58.540]  they do have to say it in front of everyone. Well, I don't, okay. Geoff's always like, all right.
[27:59.980 --> 28:05.760]  Even though he knows exactly what's going on. Yeah. Geoff Brooks is great at playing that
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.420]  shit straight. He's like, if you say so, moving on. Anyway, that's the survivor update of the week.
[28:10.860 --> 28:14.540]  Yeah. I will say the one thing that was great about watching it last night was,
[28:15.100 --> 28:18.700]  you know, we all picked our characters and, you know, Gavin picked Brad and I picked Tiffany.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.360]  And last night was just an, it was just watch, we both could tell one of us was going home
[28:24.360 --> 28:31.060]  and it was just watching two people just fucking, just fall, fall through survivor.
[28:31.140 --> 28:35.400]  My pick had a big sway in the decision. We were all involved in some way. You two felt like one
[28:35.400 --> 28:41.060]  of you were going home. My pick was like, I got to make this choice. Disappointed. Disappointed
[28:41.060 --> 28:45.760]  in my pick. Just hum and do some evil shit. That's what you do. Vote the other way.
[28:46.260 --> 28:51.180]  Oh, uh, if you want for the baseball portion of this non-baseball podcast, I will say, uh,
[28:51.580 --> 28:57.220]  Yankees, Red Sox wildcard game the other night, there was so much Don Zimmer coverage. It was
[28:57.220 --> 29:02.360]  awesome. He really showed up in a bunch of different vignettes. They showed the Pedro fight.
[29:02.580 --> 29:05.860]  They had all kinds of Zimmer coverage. If you're a Zimmer, if you're a fan of the Zim,
[29:05.920 --> 29:07.680]  it was a good, uh, it was a good time to tune in.
[29:07.800 --> 29:11.500]  I'm so glad you mentioned that. Cause I was watching that and they had a cut. They were
[29:11.500 --> 29:17.020]  doing like history of the series between the teams and they just showed an image of Don Zimmer face
[29:17.020 --> 29:22.460]  in the grass when he fell. I was like, that's the least flattering image of all the images for
[29:22.460 --> 29:29.180]  that. You choose that to be the representation of him face first on impact. And Pedro Martinez,
[29:29.640 --> 29:34.560]  uh, who threw him, uh, you know, the Pedro and the Don Pedro project that I'm working on. He,
[29:34.820 --> 29:41.040]  uh, he is one of the color commentators for like the, uh, T or TBS, like before the game coverage
[29:41.040 --> 29:46.980]  with Ernie from, uh, inside the NBA on TNT. And he's very funny and very, uh, colorful. I'll say
[29:46.980 --> 29:57.250]  he's a funny dude. This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp Online Therapy. The best way to think
[29:57.250 --> 30:02.490]  about therapy is through a bunch of analogies. We get oil changes for our cars to prevent bigger
[30:02.490 --> 30:06.710]  issues down the road. We see the doctor and we go to the gym to take care of our bodies,
[30:06.730 --> 30:12.170]  to present injury and disease. We do chores. Well, some of us do chores regularly to avoid messy
[30:12.170 --> 30:16.690]  houses. Going to therapy is like all of the above. It is routine maintenance for your mental
[30:16.690 --> 30:21.710]  and emotional wellness to prevent bigger issues down the road. Going to therapy doesn't mean that
[30:21.710 --> 30:25.790]  something's wrong with you. It means you're investing in yourself to keep your mind healthy.
[30:26.170 --> 30:31.690]  BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions
[30:31.690 --> 30:36.770]  with your therapist. So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to. It is much
[30:36.770 --> 30:40.550]  more affordable than in-person therapy, and you can start communicating with your therapist in
[30:40.550 --> 30:47.070]  under 48 hours. Why invest in everything else and not your mind? This podcast is sponsored by

[31:01.130 --> 31:07.070]  even the messiest of poops, leaving you with a better clean than toilet paper. Discuss your
[31:07.070 --> 31:13.610]  worst poop experiences and how TUSHY could have helped. I routinely discuss my poop experiences,
[31:13.750 --> 31:22.650]  good and bad, on this very podcast in gross detail. And I mention quite often
[31:22.650 --> 31:28.090]  about the efficacy of cleaning your butthole with water. Think of it this way. Is your butt right
[31:28.090 --> 31:33.890]  now clean enough to sit on your couch naked? If no, get a TUSHY, the modern bidet that attaches
[31:33.890 --> 31:39.430]  directly to your toilet in under 10 minutes. TUSHY is the modern bidet for people who poop
[31:39.430 --> 31:44.070]  modernly. Think of it this way. You don't want to be some old pooper living in the past,
[31:44.290 --> 31:50.430]  adhering to some old aristocracy, when the modern people are taking modern dumps in a modern bidet.
[31:50.770 --> 31:54.810]  It's easy to install, it attaches to the toilet in under 10 minutes, it doesn't require electricity
[31:54.810 --> 32:01.490]  or plumbing, and it reduces your toilet paper use by 80%, saving you money and earth trees.
[32:01.490 --> 32:05.370]  So start washing with a TUSHY bidet for a better clean.

[32:23.950 --> 32:28.270]  Should we talk about garlic? We're halfway through.
[32:28.890 --> 32:33.470]  My front door just, um, let me go see if my garlic thing showed up. I'll be right back.
[32:34.010 --> 32:34.730]  What do you mean your garlic?
[32:34.970 --> 32:38.730]  We should also cover the, um, the I'm not a blank guy list.
[32:39.050 --> 32:43.030]  Yeah! Well, I think we need to touch on garlic and then we can do that.
[32:43.610 --> 32:44.530]  Yeah, you want to do it that way, Ralph?
[32:44.890 --> 32:48.190]  I think so, because I've had my foot in garlic for an hour now.
[32:50.230 --> 32:53.530]  I feel like we need to mention it. It was supposed to...
[32:53.530 --> 32:55.530]  You always just do stuff!
[32:55.530 --> 33:00.910]  Well, no, no, no, no, no. Let me hear. The science said you had to do it an hour before,
[33:01.110 --> 33:03.550]  that it didn't kick in until an hour into it, so...
[33:03.550 --> 33:05.830]  So you're the only one partaking in this experiment.
[33:05.870 --> 33:06.830]  So I put it in...
[33:06.830 --> 33:07.830]  Because mine has not been...
[33:07.830 --> 33:10.570]  Why didn't you tell me when I was six minutes early?
[33:10.790 --> 33:17.110]  I didn't know what getting ready meant. I didn't know anyone else was doing garlic.
[33:17.370 --> 33:22.030]  I'm getting garlic, I'm making cheese and pickle sandwiches. I'm getting all this shit ready.
[33:22.030 --> 33:22.690]  What do you mean?
[33:23.090 --> 33:23.350]  What?
[33:23.410 --> 33:25.310]  What are you talking? We're halfway through!
[33:25.310 --> 33:27.130]  You're too late anyway, regardless.
[33:27.150 --> 33:27.910]  Are we garlic-ing?
[33:28.350 --> 33:29.550]  Well, did you hear that, Geoff?
[33:29.590 --> 33:30.850]  I've been garlic-ing!
[33:30.890 --> 33:31.490]  No, what's up?
[33:32.550 --> 33:37.530]  Apparently, dipshit, the experiment only works if you've had your foot in garlic for an hour.
[33:37.830 --> 33:40.950]  So I was saying, why didn't he tell me that when I was six minutes early?
[33:41.010 --> 33:42.270]  I could have dunked the first foot in.
[33:42.290 --> 33:46.270]  I've been sitting here next to a tray of garlic. I could have put my foot in it at any point.
[33:46.370 --> 33:46.710]  Okay.
[33:47.290 --> 33:50.190]  I think the second thing is you need to contain it as well.
[33:50.390 --> 33:53.890]  Like, you need to wrap it. It's not just that your foot is in...
[33:53.890 --> 33:55.010]  Where was all this information?
[33:55.530 --> 33:57.290]  No, no, no, no. I don't have to contain it.
[33:57.390 --> 34:01.250]  Dude, I saw your garlic. I have, like, minced, liquid garlic.
[34:01.490 --> 34:06.010]  That's gonna be... that's gonna fucking... that's... it's gonna seep into my pores.
[34:06.110 --> 34:06.930]  Hold on. Which foot?
[34:07.550 --> 34:09.570]  Let me... I'll show you. I'll post.
[34:09.710 --> 34:13.330]  I got... I've been wearing a garlic shoe for this entire podcast so far.
[34:13.330 --> 34:15.710]  Oh, this sucks. I'm going out for a meal tonight.
[34:15.770 --> 34:19.830]  I'm gonna be just tasting garlic based on the freaking stuff that was on my foot an hour ago.
[34:20.170 --> 34:21.690]  This is... this is my foot.
[34:21.690 --> 34:23.290]  I just got garlic shit.
[34:25.090 --> 34:25.870]  So here...
[34:25.870 --> 34:29.510]  Andrew's foot is wrapped in... that is the most disgusting picture I've ever seen.
[34:30.670 --> 34:33.110]  I can... I can one-up you, buddy. Hold on a second.
[34:33.850 --> 34:36.870]  That's just gonna be full of sweat. There's no way that's...
[34:38.770 --> 34:41.850]  He sweat-logged his foot and there's garlic in the bag.
[34:41.850 --> 34:44.310]  You're supposed to contain it and it takes an hour,
[34:44.430 --> 34:47.810]  so I thought we'd bring it up at the beginning and I'd say when the garlic kicked in.
[34:48.270 --> 34:49.750]  We're 30 minutes in.
[34:49.950 --> 34:51.430]  I'm starting to get some hints of garlic.
[34:51.430 --> 34:54.050]  And I was just gonna spread some on.
[34:54.470 --> 34:55.510]  Well, your foot...
[34:55.510 --> 34:57.890]  I got a foot full of garlic and I ordered a steak,
[34:57.970 --> 35:00.610]  so I can see if I can flavor the steak in my mouth with the garlic.
[35:01.250 --> 35:02.950]  Yeah, I made a cheese and Branston sandwich,
[35:03.110 --> 35:05.690]  and I was gonna knife some garlic onto the bottom of my foot
[35:05.690 --> 35:07.190]  and see if I could taste it in the sandwich.
[35:07.430 --> 35:12.050]  Wait! You thought that you'd immediately taste garlic after you just spread it on your ulcer?
[35:12.050 --> 35:12.990]  I don't know the rules!
[35:13.170 --> 35:16.490]  What are you spreading? What type of spread?
[35:16.810 --> 35:19.070]  You got an aioli? What are you doing? What do you mean?
[35:19.070 --> 35:20.470]  It's a little...
[35:20.470 --> 35:28.250]  I got a foot in garlic and I got my steak right here.
[35:29.630 --> 35:33.870]  It looks like you're imprinting your foot.
[35:35.570 --> 35:39.050]  What is the thing? What is the dressing in that?
[35:39.570 --> 35:40.350]  That olive oil?
[35:40.890 --> 35:41.310]  What is that?
[35:41.410 --> 35:42.570]  It's just minced garlic.
[35:44.830 --> 35:46.450]  It's pure garlic.
[35:46.970 --> 35:50.490]  Are you just gonna post a fucking photo of a butter knife, Gavin?
[35:50.590 --> 35:52.990]  What are you gonna do? What was your setup? It makes no sense.
[35:53.110 --> 35:53.890]  I was just...
[35:55.610 --> 35:57.630]  Hold on, let me post the picture.
[35:58.070 --> 35:59.430]  I was just gonna knife some of that on.
[36:02.830 --> 36:03.790]  Does that not count?
[36:04.450 --> 36:05.930]  I don't think that counts!
[36:06.850 --> 36:07.770]  Here's my steak.
[36:09.470 --> 36:12.170]  Also, it was supposed to just be an unseasoned steak.
[36:12.310 --> 36:13.850]  There's no way that's unseasoned.
[36:13.990 --> 36:15.150]  What are you doing?
[36:15.150 --> 36:18.110]  I ordered an unseasoned steak,
[36:18.230 --> 36:21.290]  and the steakhouse canceled my order two minutes before the podcast started,
[36:21.530 --> 36:24.070]  so I had to order something from Outback Steakhouse.
[36:24.350 --> 36:27.350]  What is that? You're telling me that steak isn't seasoned?
[36:28.190 --> 36:29.050]  Look at that steak!
[36:29.710 --> 36:30.990]  All right, it's going on the foot.
[36:31.290 --> 36:33.630]  Pepper all over the place. What are you doing?
[36:34.570 --> 36:36.550]  It's not seasoned in garlic, it's seasoned in pepper.
[36:37.390 --> 36:38.670]  There's some oil in this.
[36:41.210 --> 36:41.870]  Oh, I got broccoli.
[36:41.930 --> 36:43.990]  Where on the foot is the prime area?
[36:44.470 --> 36:46.030]  It's the heel, I believe.
[36:46.350 --> 36:48.690]  Oh my god, I put it everywhere except my heel.
[36:48.870 --> 36:50.310]  But what are you doing?
[36:50.930 --> 36:54.190]  The heel! You're not giving me any information!
[36:54.650 --> 36:58.190]  Your instructions are, have it on your heel an hour ago.
[36:59.750 --> 37:03.270]  Yeah, you're fucking salad. You're making a salad out of this, dude.
[37:03.570 --> 37:05.690]  What do you mean? I'm the only one who did it right!
[37:05.830 --> 37:07.410]  I didn't know there were other people going to do it.
[37:07.410 --> 37:10.170]  Because you fucking safeguarded the information and didn't let us have it.
[37:10.310 --> 37:11.830]  Well, I didn't know you were going to use it.
[37:11.870 --> 37:13.570]  First of all, from the things I've said,
[37:13.570 --> 37:14.710]  this is just incorrect.
[37:15.010 --> 37:16.930]  If anything, you should be happy, Geoff.
[37:17.010 --> 37:19.210]  You're eating a fucking steak. That looks delicious.
[37:19.770 --> 37:21.450]  Yeah, it's good, but I can't taste the garlic.
[37:22.390 --> 37:24.250]  It looks like I've stepped in cat vomit.
[37:24.790 --> 37:26.190]  What are you doing, Gavin?
[37:26.730 --> 37:27.130]  What?
[37:27.210 --> 37:28.270]  Why would you do that?
[37:28.530 --> 37:29.230]  Let's see your foot.
[37:30.530 --> 37:31.890]  No, I don't want to see it!
[37:31.950 --> 37:33.010]  No, it's too gross.
[37:34.750 --> 37:36.470]  I don't want to make foot content.
[37:36.870 --> 37:37.230]  I'm out.
[37:37.890 --> 37:39.850]  It's on there. It's on there. Trust me.
[37:40.690 --> 37:41.930]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[37:42.470 --> 37:43.970]  How much did you put on?
[37:44.130 --> 37:45.710]  Should we not release these photos?
[37:46.970 --> 37:47.930]  Is it too gross?
[37:48.210 --> 37:49.050]  No, you can really...
[37:49.050 --> 37:51.250]  If you want to make foot stuff, then go for it.
[37:54.830 --> 37:59.070]  Just really narrow it in the specific category of foot on garlic.
[37:59.570 --> 37:59.990]  Finally.
[38:00.410 --> 38:02.790]  I just love that it says fart hard in that picture.
[38:03.510 --> 38:04.690]  It's a great photo.
[38:05.290 --> 38:06.930]  Have you rolled your ankle? It looks swollen.
[38:07.330 --> 38:08.150]  It's just the angle.
[38:08.630 --> 38:09.050]  Oh, okay.
[38:09.430 --> 38:11.790]  It always looks weird if I take them at the wrong angle.
[38:13.410 --> 38:16.850]  All right. So, so far, I can smell a lot of garlic.
[38:17.430 --> 38:19.190]  Well, you just opened it. Of course you can.
[38:19.190 --> 38:19.950]  Like, I don't know.
[38:20.210 --> 38:21.650]  I can't taste this garlic yet.
[38:22.150 --> 38:23.850]  Yeah, I'm gonna take a bite of this sandwich.
[38:24.090 --> 38:26.830]  It takes an hour. I think it takes an hour to kick in.
[38:28.550 --> 38:30.110]  Tasting garlic with feet.
[38:30.670 --> 38:31.610]  Tastes like cheese and pickle.
[38:32.170 --> 38:33.550]  So, I'll just leave my foot in the thing.
[38:34.570 --> 38:38.070]  Well, Andrew, you've had your foot in garlic for a full hour.
[38:38.070 --> 38:39.110]  How does it taste?
[38:39.630 --> 38:41.090]  I'm not getting a lot of taste yet.
[38:41.190 --> 38:42.890]  I'm getting some through the nose.
[38:43.310 --> 38:46.830]  Like, I feel like I can smell it, like, deep, deep in the nose.
[38:46.910 --> 38:48.410]  But it's not in the mouth yet.
[38:48.430 --> 38:49.690]  Do you think maybe that's all it is?
[38:50.210 --> 38:51.430]  I mean, we'll find out.
[38:52.050 --> 38:53.970]  We're gonna... I'm in a position...
[38:53.970 --> 38:55.710]  If I'm gonna taste it, I'm gonna taste...
[38:55.710 --> 38:57.590]  Like, we will find out definitively.
[38:58.030 --> 39:01.430]  I got some bread. I was gonna have garlic toast or garlic bread.
[39:01.730 --> 39:02.870]  There's no garlic on the bread.
[39:03.410 --> 39:04.170]  Just foot garlic.
[39:04.730 --> 39:10.090]  I would say the cheese and bread sandwich with gentle wafts of garlic is pretty nice.
[39:11.210 --> 39:12.650]  I'm not sure I'm tasting it.
[39:13.810 --> 39:15.270]  What's your food that you're eating?
[39:15.710 --> 39:17.650]  I'm eating bread. I was gonna do garlic bread.
[39:17.950 --> 39:19.330]  Yeah, garlic bread was the idea.
[39:19.830 --> 39:21.030]  Are you a garlic bread guy?
[39:21.630 --> 39:23.230]  I'm a huge garlic bread guy.
[39:23.910 --> 39:24.750]  Love garlic bread.
[39:25.310 --> 39:27.070]  Get some cheese on there, melt it, fantastic.
[39:27.150 --> 39:27.770]  It's a great food.
[39:28.050 --> 39:29.470]  I think it might be the best bread.
[39:30.010 --> 39:31.870]  I'd go as far as saying garlic bread is the best bread.
[39:32.750 --> 39:33.550]  Oh, I don't know.
[39:33.550 --> 39:34.610]  I'd have to think about that for a while.
[39:34.690 --> 39:36.050]  But it is very, very good.
[39:36.370 --> 39:38.830]  I'm recently a two things guy.
[39:39.010 --> 39:40.470]  I know we're gonna do a whole segment about your things.
[39:40.490 --> 39:41.830]  But I just discovered I am a...
[39:41.830 --> 39:43.090]  I was talking about this with Gavin last night.
[39:43.170 --> 39:45.030]  I want to get into this in a big way with f***face.
[39:45.150 --> 39:46.330]  I'm a koozie guy now.
[39:46.890 --> 39:48.490]  I'm falling hard for koozies.
[39:48.770 --> 39:52.630]  And oh my god, are you guys aware of pastrami?
[39:53.270 --> 39:54.250]  Oh, it's like an idea?
[39:54.950 --> 39:55.670]  It's phenomenal.
[39:56.670 --> 40:01.270]  I am a f***ing pastrami guy through and through.
[40:01.270 --> 40:04.010]  I have discovered over the course of the last like three weeks.
[40:04.310 --> 40:06.790]  I cannot get enough pastrami in me.
[40:06.870 --> 40:07.970]  It is so good.
[40:08.210 --> 40:08.270]  Okay.
[40:08.490 --> 40:10.110]  I've never eaten pastrami before.
[40:10.510 --> 40:11.450]  How do you never...
[40:12.970 --> 40:13.370]  Pastrami?
[40:14.050 --> 40:15.410]  Yeah, it's not a big thing in the...
[40:15.410 --> 40:16.390]  like in the south in America.
[40:16.930 --> 40:19.710]  Yeah, oh, that's my bad.
[40:19.770 --> 40:20.590]  I should have said the hour.
[40:20.950 --> 40:21.970]  I'll... that's on me.
[40:22.510 --> 40:24.030]  It's like slipping off.
[40:25.890 --> 40:28.170]  I've got to have my foot like face up.
[40:28.430 --> 40:29.150]  What are you doing?
[40:29.170 --> 40:30.730]  You don't have a thing to put your foot into?
[40:30.730 --> 40:31.690]  Well, I don't have a tray.
[40:31.790 --> 40:33.630]  I was just going to spread it on hoping it'd be like butter.
[40:34.190 --> 40:34.550]  What are you f***ing doing?
[40:35.130 --> 40:37.330]  It's more the consistency of catsick.
[40:37.690 --> 40:39.310]  So it's sort of... if I don't keep my foot upright,
[40:39.390 --> 40:41.670]  it's just going to slough off onto the carpet.
[40:42.090 --> 40:43.310]  I just... the decisions.
[40:43.550 --> 40:44.890]  It's my fault about the hour.
[40:45.090 --> 40:47.010]  I don't know what you're doing with your game plan.
[40:47.090 --> 40:48.370]  The fact you don't have a tray.
[40:48.970 --> 40:50.810]  That's a clear cookie sheet situation.
[40:51.610 --> 40:54.870]  I got my foot nestled safely in a cookie sheet.
[40:54.950 --> 40:55.490]  It's f***ing great.
[40:58.390 --> 40:59.130]  So it says...
[41:00.230 --> 41:02.350]  It says to try it for yourself.
[41:02.530 --> 41:04.230]  Cut a piece of fresh garlic in half.
[41:04.590 --> 41:07.130]  Then in a separate room that doesn't smell like garlic,
[41:07.310 --> 41:12.990]  take off your shoes and socks and place your feet into a plastic bag with the piece of garlic.
[41:13.490 --> 41:16.310]  After an hour, you'll be able to both taste and smell the garlic.
[41:16.570 --> 41:18.130]  Neither of you are doing any of it right.
[41:18.210 --> 41:19.430]  You've missed on every level.
[41:19.590 --> 41:20.850]  It's not contained.
[41:21.130 --> 41:22.490]  It's not fresh garlic.
[41:25.750 --> 41:26.970]  You don't have a time.
[41:27.410 --> 41:29.370]  You do not have the time to taste the garlic.
[41:29.370 --> 41:33.130]  But I feel like you have to stick with what you're doing until you get that hour
[41:33.130 --> 41:34.670]  to find out if there is any effect.
[41:35.170 --> 41:38.050]  In a separate room that doesn't smell like garlic.
[41:38.890 --> 41:40.050]  How is that important?
[41:40.350 --> 41:41.690]  Does it mean you should stay in that room?
[41:42.130 --> 41:42.550]  Well, no, no.
[41:42.630 --> 41:44.450]  It's just, you know, garlic gives a lot of odor.
[41:44.570 --> 41:45.330]  So you don't want to be...
[41:45.330 --> 41:49.130]  You, like, want to establish this isn't from cutting up the garlic in this space.
[41:49.710 --> 41:50.290]  You're smelling...
[41:50.290 --> 41:52.810]  You're in a garlic freeze-out outside of what's on your plate.
[41:53.410 --> 41:55.010]  Oh, can I give you guys a little bit of good...
[41:55.010 --> 41:55.710]  Oh, there's good veggies.
[41:55.890 --> 41:58.450]  Can I give you guys a little bit of good f***face news?
[41:58.450 --> 41:59.730]  Yes, yes.
[42:00.390 --> 42:03.790]  The most recent episode of f***face to be in the report...
[42:03.790 --> 42:05.790]  I don't know if it's this Wednesday's episode.
[42:06.110 --> 42:07.290]  No, it'd be last week's episode.
[42:07.590 --> 42:09.850]  So that was 70 or 71.
[42:10.090 --> 42:12.950]  I think it was the... probably the Spicy Icy episode.
[42:13.570 --> 42:19.170]  Last week's episode was 70, which was the mid-episode retraction and retrain an anus.
[42:19.630 --> 42:20.630]  Okay, that one.
[42:20.990 --> 42:26.710]  That is the... on track to be the highest viewed episode or listened to episode of all time.
[42:27.110 --> 42:28.370]  Wow, that's awesome.
[42:28.450 --> 42:30.290]  Yeah, it's doing really well.
[42:30.430 --> 42:32.470]  Thank you to everybody who's listening and sharing it.
[42:32.470 --> 42:34.830]  For real, thank you so much to everybody who's listening.
[42:35.130 --> 42:37.650]  And some of you appear to be listening twice or even three times.
[42:37.990 --> 42:39.530]  Like you two or three times more.
[42:39.790 --> 42:42.550]  And if you told somebody about it, super appreciate that too.
[42:42.750 --> 42:44.590]  It's nice to know that people are listening.
[42:45.070 --> 42:47.810]  I really appreciate the people who are actually telling...
[42:48.730 --> 42:49.650]  Because it's a gamble.
[42:49.790 --> 42:51.770]  It's a gamble saying, hey, listen to this podcast.
[42:52.030 --> 42:53.310]  Give up your time for this s***.
[42:54.070 --> 42:56.250]  I feel like that's a special bond.
[42:56.250 --> 42:58.810]  If you know someone you would share this podcast with,
[42:59.130 --> 43:00.850]  I think that's great for your friendship.
[43:01.190 --> 43:02.570]  Listen, you need to hear me out.
[43:02.690 --> 43:04.730]  But they put a bunch of garlic on their feet.
[43:06.930 --> 43:07.990]  But they did it wrong.
[43:08.130 --> 43:09.010]  And that's why it's funny.
[43:11.510 --> 43:12.190]  Goddamn, dude.
[43:13.930 --> 43:17.550]  The thing, I don't even know if I did it right, to be completely honest.
[43:17.830 --> 43:20.470]  We're just going to be sharing things here.
[43:20.570 --> 43:21.570]  I don't know if I did it right.
[43:21.630 --> 43:23.210]  I don't think I cut into every piece.
[43:23.430 --> 43:25.770]  I've got five pieces of garlic in the bag.
[43:26.250 --> 43:27.250]  I cut two and a half.
[43:27.470 --> 43:28.550]  I guess three of them.
[43:28.690 --> 43:29.650]  I think that's a three cut.
[43:29.990 --> 43:30.690]  I think it's enough.
[43:30.770 --> 43:32.550]  I think if I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it at that point.
[43:32.730 --> 43:35.230]  All I know is that I don't want to be anywhere near that when you open the bag.
[43:35.890 --> 43:36.630]  It's going to be.
[43:36.910 --> 43:37.730]  That's the problem.
[43:38.210 --> 43:38.530]  Rancid.
[43:38.650 --> 43:39.430]  Here's the thing.
[43:39.670 --> 43:40.010]  I don't.
[43:40.210 --> 43:41.130]  I'm scared to do it.
[43:41.350 --> 43:43.390]  I don't know when I'm going to take this bag off.
[43:43.530 --> 43:44.690]  It might just be here for a while.
[43:45.410 --> 43:46.410]  Just shove that bag.
[43:46.550 --> 43:49.530]  Just take your foot with that bag and shove it in the fire extinguisher bag.
[43:49.970 --> 43:55.170]  I just make it like a matryoshka doll of dumb s*** you've done on this podcast.
[43:55.170 --> 43:56.590]  Take it out of that bag.
[43:56.750 --> 44:00.550]  Dump it straight in the fire extinguisher dust and it will dampen the smell.
[44:01.090 --> 44:03.690]  Realistically, I don't know why I'd have to take the bag off.
[44:04.110 --> 44:06.390]  Like, what would be the thing that forces me to do it?
[44:06.610 --> 44:09.830]  I think I could live my life with this foot bag for a while if I want.
[44:09.830 --> 44:10.450]  You're a fool.
[44:10.730 --> 44:11.310]  It would rot away.
[44:11.310 --> 44:11.750]  I don't want to.
[44:12.170 --> 44:12.970]  I don't want to.
[44:13.270 --> 44:14.510]  I'm just saying I think I could.
[44:14.990 --> 44:15.450]  You could.
[44:15.590 --> 44:16.910]  And here, I'm going to go through something.
[44:16.990 --> 44:22.610]  This reminds me of a piece of golden, amazing, brilliant early internet.
[44:23.510 --> 44:25.690]  Do you guys remember the spark.com?
[44:26.230 --> 44:26.390]  No.
[44:27.110 --> 44:30.710]  I think it's like a cliff notes kind of thing.
[44:31.050 --> 44:33.450]  And then I think it eventually turned into a dating site.
[44:34.290 --> 44:36.970]  But before that, they did like, it was like an internet.
[44:37.390 --> 44:39.470]  Well, they called them Ian sites, everything, nothing site.
[44:39.530 --> 44:41.890]  But it was like a blog, like entertainment site back in the day.
[44:42.330 --> 44:45.330]  And there was a guy on there named Christian who would do all these experiments.
[44:45.550 --> 44:47.230]  He did this one called the Date My Sister Project.
[44:47.730 --> 44:48.590]  He did a bunch of different stuff.
[44:48.630 --> 44:51.370]  But he did one called, there was one called the Stinky Meat Project,
[44:51.370 --> 44:54.830]  where somebody took a whole bunch of like barbecue,
[44:55.150 --> 44:58.290]  and they put it on a plate, and then they hid it in their neighbor's backyard.
[44:58.750 --> 45:02.970]  And then they just would sneak over once a day and document it as it was deteriorating
[45:02.970 --> 45:05.030]  and seeing how long it would take his neighbors to notice the smell.
[45:05.310 --> 45:09.230]  So he did one that was like a response to that called the Stinky Feet Project,
[45:09.610 --> 45:11.170]  where he went, and he's from Boston.
[45:11.350 --> 45:16.530]  He went into a public, like a YMCA shower, barefoot with one foot.
[45:16.630 --> 45:20.450]  And he walked around the shower and bathroom barefoot.
[45:20.450 --> 45:24.570]  And then he stuck his foot in a plastic bag for 30 days and didn't take it out.
[45:25.190 --> 45:28.670]  It was called the Stinky Feet Project to see like what would happen to him.
[45:28.730 --> 45:31.090]  And he documented it hilariously the whole way.
[45:31.570 --> 45:35.870]  And he ended up with like, you know, all manner of issues with his foot.
[45:36.090 --> 45:37.190]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[45:37.270 --> 45:38.010]  Was any of it permanent?
[45:38.370 --> 45:39.290]  I don't know. I don't know.
[45:39.350 --> 45:41.190]  That was so, this was like pre-Rooster Teeth.
[45:41.270 --> 45:45.550]  This was early 2000s, probably 2001, 2002.
[45:46.250 --> 45:49.170]  But if you could probably find it online, it was a very funny,
[45:49.170 --> 45:53.090]  you know, back then it was all like pictures and words.
[45:53.550 --> 45:55.250]  That was pre-video. So very funny.
[45:55.470 --> 45:58.770]  I feel like as long as I hop on one leg, I could commit crimes right now.
[45:58.950 --> 46:00.290]  And I'd be good. I wouldn't get caught.
[46:02.610 --> 46:05.990]  Except you would leave a trail of garlic smell all the way back to the bed.
[46:06.970 --> 46:08.710]  I'm like a villain. I'm like a Batman villain.
[46:08.890 --> 46:09.910]  The garlic bandit. Yeah.
[46:10.010 --> 46:14.930]  Yep. I think I smell garlic right now.
[46:15.530 --> 46:17.590]  I think it's coming. I think it's kicking in.
[46:17.590 --> 46:20.390]  I can really, I got some garlic in the air.
[46:20.750 --> 46:22.070]  That's probably because there's garlic.
[46:22.250 --> 46:23.650]  Have you achieved a full hour?
[46:24.010 --> 46:27.470]  Yeah. No, I put this on 74 minutes ago.
[46:27.670 --> 46:30.390]  So I'm getting, I feel like I'm getting, I feel like it's kicking in.
[46:30.690 --> 46:34.210]  I feel like I'm getting some strong, strong garden, garden, garlic.
[46:35.250 --> 46:38.250]  I can't even say it. Strong garlic odors right now.
[46:38.550 --> 46:41.490]  Yeah, but that's because there's actually garlic in your foot.
[46:41.690 --> 46:42.790]  No, but it's in my nose, right?
[46:42.810 --> 46:43.990]  And like, it's, it's deep.
[46:44.290 --> 46:45.430]  Listen, you wouldn't understand.
[46:45.530 --> 46:46.730]  You didn't do this experiment right.
[46:47.590 --> 46:49.650]  But it is, it's in my core.
[46:49.750 --> 46:53.790]  Have you wrapped the bag enough to the point where you know no garlic is leaking out?
[46:54.050 --> 46:56.590]  I taped the fuck out of the top of that bag.
[46:56.730 --> 46:58.550]  I did like 12 loops with tape.
[46:58.570 --> 47:00.210]  Oh yeah, it's taped to your, it's taped to your leg hair.
[47:00.770 --> 47:03.030]  Oh, it's going to be a problem when I take off this bag.
[47:03.270 --> 47:04.550]  That's not going to be fun.
[47:04.790 --> 47:11.030]  Do you know, I think I know the next f*** face uniform project we could make.
[47:11.470 --> 47:12.110]  Garlic bags?
[47:12.450 --> 47:15.190]  Garlic patches, garlic patches for your feet.
[47:15.190 --> 47:18.790]  Yeah, almost like I like those like icy hot patches you put on your back,
[47:18.850 --> 47:23.010]  but they didn't imbue the power of garlic into your foot so that you could be like,
[47:23.490 --> 47:27.210]  Hey, my, you know, my girlfriend doesn't like when I eat garlic because it gives me a stinky mouth,
[47:27.370 --> 47:28.950]  but I like to eat garlic with my dinner.
[47:29.070 --> 47:33.370]  So like an hour before you go to your restaurant, slap on a garlic patch on the heel of your foot,
[47:33.670 --> 47:38.010]  put your sock and your shoe on like normal, eat, go eat your steak and your mashed potatoes.
[47:38.290 --> 47:40.310]  You'll be tasting garlic all goddamn day long.
[47:40.350 --> 47:42.750]  But when you get a kisser at the end of the night, you won't have garlic breath.
[47:42.750 --> 47:45.530]  Would it be like a massive nicotine patch?
[47:46.090 --> 47:49.190]  Like with like a big Band-Aid with a garlic like lump in the middle?
[47:49.990 --> 47:53.890]  It could be. Yeah, we'll call it Flavor Foot. It's going to revolutionize the world.
[47:53.990 --> 47:58.230]  Could it just be socks, Geoff? Could we sell it? Would it be a garlic sock product, maybe?
[47:58.970 --> 47:59.630]  Uh, normal socks.
[47:59.950 --> 48:02.210]  It looks like a normal sock, but you slip it over.
[48:02.530 --> 48:03.850]  Two left garlic socks.
[48:04.270 --> 48:08.750]  I was asking, I had a merch meeting yesterday and I was asking the merch guys if we could
[48:08.750 --> 48:15.250]  sell like, uh, face branded like Tiger Balm and Icy Hot for all of my injuries.
[48:16.210 --> 48:16.630]  What?
[48:17.130 --> 48:17.750]  They said no.
[48:18.110 --> 48:20.330]  Yeah, I feel like that's a tough one.
[48:20.830 --> 48:21.250]  Yeah.
[48:21.790 --> 48:26.110]  Also, all of your relationship to Tiger Balm on this show has been shoving it in your asshole.
[48:26.250 --> 48:29.110]  I don't feel like that's a thing you then want to sell like as a...
[48:29.110 --> 48:31.550]  Well, I wanted to get like the patch for my back.
[48:31.930 --> 48:32.950]  I'm going through them.
[48:33.350 --> 48:34.050]  That's fair.
[48:35.190 --> 48:36.490]  You're fucking back.
[48:37.390 --> 48:39.590]  You're going to ride roller coasters next week.
[48:40.990 --> 48:42.350]  I'm definitely going to see them.
[48:42.470 --> 48:43.210]  I don't know if I'll ride them.
[48:44.510 --> 48:45.970]  You just made my week, Geoff.
[48:46.170 --> 48:50.630]  All of next week, I'll be thinking about you and your shitty back walking around the amusement park.
[48:51.130 --> 48:52.150]  I'm not going to be...
[48:52.150 --> 48:53.950]  I don't know how much walking I'll be doing either.
[48:53.950 --> 48:57.190]  You're going to experience zero amusement at this amusement park.
[48:57.290 --> 48:58.350]  It's going to be fantastic.
[48:58.710 --> 48:59.710]  It's going to make me very happy.
[49:00.010 --> 49:02.970]  Jack made a joke today that he would just push me around in a wheelchair.
[49:02.970 --> 49:04.410]  So I can't get out of it.
[49:04.490 --> 49:06.610]  And that actually seems like a solution to me.
[49:06.890 --> 49:09.210]  So I'm open to that if I have to.
[49:10.630 --> 49:14.330]  Just like the idea of some fan seeing that and taking a picture.
[49:14.450 --> 49:16.670]  Just be like, well, look at where Achievement Hunt has ended up.
[49:27.490 --> 49:28.410]  Oh, this garlic.
[49:28.470 --> 49:29.870]  I'm getting a lot of garlic.
[49:30.010 --> 49:30.850]  I'm tasting it.
[49:31.170 --> 49:32.050]  It's working.
[49:32.330 --> 49:33.590]  The science is working.
[49:33.970 --> 49:35.670]  You're tasting it just in your mouth.
[49:36.050 --> 49:37.790]  I'm tasting it in my mouth right now.
[49:37.850 --> 49:38.930]  This is fucking crazy.
[49:39.330 --> 49:40.650]  I didn't expect this to work.
[49:41.070 --> 49:42.790]  Are you are you still garlicking, Gavin?
[49:44.370 --> 49:45.390]  No, I was.
[49:45.630 --> 49:47.990]  My leg was going numb and I wasn't like an hour in.
[49:48.070 --> 49:49.770]  So I just scraped the garlic off.
[49:49.810 --> 49:53.270]  Well, for the record, I had a feeling you were going to bitch out.
[49:53.350 --> 49:54.710]  But for the record, I am still garlicking.
[49:55.050 --> 49:57.210]  So I got to be going on 30 minutes at this point.
[49:57.290 --> 49:58.030]  I should I should be getting.
[49:59.170 --> 50:02.010]  I mean, you're missing key steps, but I need to try.
[50:02.130 --> 50:02.910]  I need to have some bread.
[50:03.170 --> 50:03.570]  Give me a minute.
[50:03.630 --> 50:04.290]  Let me get this bread.
[50:04.590 --> 50:05.330]  Let me open this up.
[50:05.350 --> 50:06.650]  See if this is some garlic bread.
[50:07.390 --> 50:08.890]  Well, it should be toast, really, shouldn't it?
[50:09.330 --> 50:10.030]  The full effect.
[50:10.490 --> 50:12.690]  Well, is it?
[50:12.990 --> 50:13.830]  No, there's not.
[50:13.890 --> 50:15.630]  You can have garlic bread without it being toasted.
[50:16.130 --> 50:20.190]  What do you think is more iconic, garlic bread or garlic mashed potatoes?
[50:20.690 --> 50:21.570]  Oh, garlic bread.
[50:21.970 --> 50:22.830]  Yeah, I guess so.
[50:22.970 --> 50:23.570]  By a lot.
[50:23.930 --> 50:25.050]  Garlic mashed potatoes are great.
[50:25.390 --> 50:29.130]  That that reminds me we need to I feel like we need to get into this list
[50:29.130 --> 50:30.250]  because there's some things.
[50:30.790 --> 50:31.630]  Yeah, let's get into the list.
[50:31.910 --> 50:33.670]  There's some things that we need to address with this.
[50:33.670 --> 50:39.130]  So an amazing comment leaver has compiled a list of all of the
[50:39.590 --> 50:43.150]  I'm not or I am a blank guy moments from Andrew.
[50:44.230 --> 50:48.110]  And it is an insane thing to read in a row.
[50:48.730 --> 50:51.130]  Shall I just read down the list and then we can get into that?
[50:51.230 --> 50:52.450]  Like, do you remember what they are?
[50:52.870 --> 50:55.610]  Uh, do you want to do that or do you want to go one by one?
[50:55.870 --> 50:57.050]  And then we like address.
[50:57.190 --> 51:00.730]  Yeah, let's go one by one and I can address them as they appear.
[51:00.730 --> 51:03.430]  Okay, it's definitely what I'm immediately noticing is it's
[51:04.010 --> 51:07.550]  definitely ramped up as face has gone off towards the beginning.
[51:07.730 --> 51:10.190]  There's like a seven episode gap where you never said it.
[51:10.250 --> 51:12.150]  There's a nine episode gap after that.
[51:12.350 --> 51:15.250]  All right, episode one.
[51:15.490 --> 51:18.970]  It just says unsure if he's a Dan Bilzerian guy.
[51:19.370 --> 51:21.230]  Definitely not a Dan Bilzerian guy.
[51:21.850 --> 51:23.410]  That is that has been an update.
[51:23.510 --> 51:25.950]  Episode eight, not a pickle guy.
[51:26.410 --> 51:26.990]  Still true.
[51:27.690 --> 51:29.550]  Not a good medical person.
[51:29.550 --> 51:33.290]  I don't know what that I'm going to assume it's like.
[51:33.550 --> 51:34.750]  I don't know what that is.
[51:34.890 --> 51:36.570]  I don't know what that is, but I think it's probably true.
[51:36.770 --> 51:37.550]  I'd say that's okay.
[51:38.250 --> 51:39.510]  Do you want to move on from that one?
[51:39.610 --> 51:40.130]  Is that the best?
[51:40.930 --> 51:44.270]  I'm going to guess that that's probably related to, like,
[51:44.350 --> 51:47.350]  going to get checked out when my ankle's fucked up or something like that.
[51:47.530 --> 51:48.710]  Like, I'm going to assume it's that.
[51:49.310 --> 51:51.450]  Episode 19, not an egg guy.
[51:51.610 --> 51:52.630]  Still not an egg guy.
[51:52.670 --> 51:53.630]  Still haven't tried it.
[51:53.670 --> 51:56.090]  I feel like the classic, classic, classic moment.
[51:56.730 --> 51:58.190]  Not a big chocolate fan.
[51:58.190 --> 52:00.930]  See, that is, I want to, I want to clarify that.
[52:01.030 --> 52:02.090]  That's an important clarification.
[52:02.550 --> 52:04.130]  I, it's not that I dislike chocolate.
[52:04.130 --> 52:06.550]  I would say I'm not a chocolate guy.
[52:06.750 --> 52:07.550]  I think that's true.
[52:07.710 --> 52:08.810]  I prefer, like, salt.
[52:09.310 --> 52:11.330]  But, you okay, Geoff?
[52:11.510 --> 52:12.290]  You getting some garlic?
[52:14.770 --> 52:18.730]  I feel like you may have moved your foot and the wind is taking the garlic.
[52:20.170 --> 52:21.990]  I haven't moved my foot at all.
[52:22.190 --> 52:24.390]  But I'm telling you, I'm sitting in garlic juice.
[52:24.390 --> 52:30.490]  I think it's, dude, my nose all at once just started tickling in the back.
[52:30.750 --> 52:33.570]  And, like, burning like I had wasabi or something.
[52:34.590 --> 52:37.470]  I definitely can smell garlic in a way I couldn't before.
[52:37.610 --> 52:39.490]  A deep, a deep garlic smell.
[52:39.910 --> 52:40.890]  Oh, it's uncomfortable.
[52:44.220 --> 52:45.180]  Sorry, sorry, continue.
[52:46.020 --> 52:48.620]  I think my favorite thing about this list is that for episode one,
[52:48.740 --> 52:51.280]  you were unsure if you were a Dan Bilzerian guy.
[52:51.520 --> 52:54.400]  I don't think he knew who he was.
[52:54.400 --> 52:56.580]  I didn't really know who he was.
[52:56.680 --> 52:57.900]  Yeah, I've learned since.
[52:58.120 --> 53:00.040]  Not a Dan Bilzerian guy at all.
[53:00.700 --> 53:02.800]  Episode 21, not a frozen fruit guy.
[53:03.040 --> 53:04.560]  This is, I need to talk about this.
[53:04.640 --> 53:06.820]  This has been a big recent change in my life.
[53:07.300 --> 53:10.800]  I am now, put it on record, I'm now a big frozen fruit guy.
[53:11.200 --> 53:13.100]  Big frozen fruit guy.
[53:13.220 --> 53:15.280]  Episode 21, not a frozen fruit guy.
[53:15.380 --> 53:17.900]  Episode 73, a frozen fruit guy.
[53:18.160 --> 53:18.440]  Yep.
[53:18.940 --> 53:20.040]  No, it's on the books.
[53:20.140 --> 53:24.140]  I would almost go as far as saying I recently have gotten into some frozen raspberries.
[53:24.140 --> 53:26.240]  Store-bought, frozen in a bag raspberries.
[53:26.380 --> 53:26.920]  Game changer.
[53:27.320 --> 53:30.440]  Might be my favorite way to eat raspberries at this point.
[53:30.800 --> 53:32.680]  Throw them in some water, use them as ice cubes.
[53:32.740 --> 53:33.960]  Just eat them out of the bag.
[53:34.040 --> 53:34.600]  They're delicious.
[53:34.900 --> 53:36.720]  You might want to blend them up on you in a smoothie.
[53:37.240 --> 53:38.560]  Well, I'm sure you could do that too.
[53:38.620 --> 53:39.680]  I haven't gone that far yet.
[53:39.780 --> 53:41.680]  I've just, I've used them as like...
[53:41.680 --> 53:43.140]  Snacking on ice cubes of raspberries.
[53:43.480 --> 53:44.400]  Yeah, they're great.
[53:44.680 --> 53:45.120]  Try it.
[53:45.180 --> 53:45.960]  It's fucking delicious.
[53:47.180 --> 53:47.900]  Highly recommend.
[53:48.220 --> 53:49.400]  Are you an ice eater?
[53:49.560 --> 53:52.540]  Because a lot of people just chew and crunch up ice cubes.
[53:52.540 --> 53:54.800]  That's another thing.
[53:55.120 --> 53:56.860]  I was also, I hated ice.
[53:56.940 --> 53:57.900]  I've become an ice guy.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  I'm not gonna chew on them.
[53:59.140 --> 54:00.680]  I'm not a big chewing ice guy.
[54:00.940 --> 54:03.220]  But I'm putting them in some drinks recently.
[54:04.000 --> 54:04.900]  OutKast was right.
[54:05.900 --> 54:06.300]  Cooler.
[54:06.400 --> 54:07.880]  There is something cooler than cool.
[54:08.200 --> 54:09.060]  And it's ice cold.
[54:09.160 --> 54:10.140]  And it's fucking great.
[54:10.360 --> 54:11.660]  Put some ice in that drink.
[54:12.240 --> 54:13.440]  You're gonna have a great time.
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.120]  I used to just think, oh, it's in the fridge.
[54:15.160 --> 54:15.520]  It's cool.
[54:15.580 --> 54:16.020]  I'm good enough.
[54:16.280 --> 54:17.940]  No, you get some ice cubes in there.
[54:18.020 --> 54:19.120]  It is delicious.
[54:20.120 --> 54:20.740]  Big ice guy.
[54:20.740 --> 54:22.580]  The list faster than I can read it.
[54:22.640 --> 54:23.260]  All right.
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.300]  Not a big syrup guy.
[54:26.720 --> 54:27.500]  That's true.
[54:27.620 --> 54:30.540]  In the same episode, not a pants guy.
[54:30.980 --> 54:32.280]  I don't even own a pair of pants.
[54:32.580 --> 54:34.060]  So yeah, still remains true.
[54:34.280 --> 54:34.740]  Do not own.
[54:34.780 --> 54:35.780]  No, I hate pants.
[54:36.280 --> 54:37.500]  Not a caffeine person.
[54:38.180 --> 54:39.100]  Yeah, it's not a judgment.
[54:39.220 --> 54:40.340]  I just don't drink coffee.
[54:40.500 --> 54:42.520]  I'm not a big energy drink consumer.
[54:42.680 --> 54:44.700]  I just don't have a lot of caffeine, but nothing against it.
[54:44.900 --> 54:48.360]  Are you still, are you still using your Keurig to make other shit?
[54:48.360 --> 54:52.840]  I haven't used it in a while to make anything but hot chocolate.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.060]  I'm still in some hot chocolate rotation with it, but I haven't used it for ramen recently.
[54:57.280 --> 54:57.720]  Gotcha.
[54:58.040 --> 54:58.840]  No cooking recipes.
[54:59.380 --> 55:02.780]  Episode 29, would love to be a hat guy.
[55:03.160 --> 55:05.340]  I would absolutely love to be a hat guy.
[55:05.480 --> 55:06.620]  It's just, my head's too big.
[55:07.180 --> 55:07.920]  Can't do it.
[55:08.820 --> 55:11.840]  In the same episode, not a big party guy.
[55:12.280 --> 55:15.160]  Okay, that might have been the one where you sat in the chair.
[55:15.660 --> 55:18.100]  Yeah, probably it was within the context of that.
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.720]  Episode 30, not a mayo guy, not a soup guy, not a heating guy.
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.020]  So we need to tackle these one at a time.
[55:30.360 --> 55:35.120]  I am still not a mayo guy, but holy shit am I an aioli guy.
[55:35.360 --> 55:37.140]  I fucking love an aioli.
[55:37.420 --> 55:39.940]  You give me a roasted garlic aioli, I know it's just mayo,
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.120]  but if you have a different word, you fancy it up and call it an aioli, I'm all on board.
[55:44.380 --> 55:46.300]  Give me endless aioli, but I hate mayo.
[55:46.300 --> 55:49.160]  So you like flavored mayo, is what you're saying?
[55:49.440 --> 55:52.880]  I'm a fan of flavored mayo, and I'm okay with mayo as long as I know it's not there.
[55:53.100 --> 55:54.320]  It needs to be a sneaky mayo.
[55:54.820 --> 55:59.580]  So do you think one step up from the condiment challenge would be the aioli challenge?
[55:59.980 --> 56:02.720]  I don't want us to touch condiments ever in the future.
[56:08.060 --> 56:11.220]  You also can't do better than a garlic aioli, so there's no point.
[56:11.500 --> 56:12.760]  There's no evolution on that.
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.340]  Last night at Survivor, Meg brought up the condiment thing,
[56:16.380 --> 56:18.480]  and I was just like, nope, touchy subject.
[56:23.440 --> 56:27.720]  Still not a soup guy, absolutely hate heating. Not a fan of it in any way, not a fan.
[56:27.860 --> 56:29.040]  What does that mean, heating?
[56:29.680 --> 56:31.320]  Like radiators, or like central air?
[56:31.360 --> 56:35.860]  Yeah, yeah, like if I want my place to be as cool as it possibly can be,
[56:35.880 --> 56:38.980]  I don't like it when it's hot outside, I much prefer cold over hot.
[56:39.300 --> 56:40.140]  But what if you're too cold?
[56:40.140 --> 56:44.460]  I'm never too cold. Never, doesn't happen. It's never an issue.
[56:45.740 --> 56:47.880]  Okay. Still not a soup guy, interesting.
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.860]  Because there's some good soups out there. There's some great soups.
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.320]  I could see myself eventually becoming a soup guy, but I just haven't experienced it.
[56:55.360 --> 56:56.580]  What's your favorite soup, Gavin?
[56:56.760 --> 56:58.080]  Yeah, I feel like mine was an acquired taste.
[56:58.160 --> 57:01.960]  My favorite soup is probably my least favorite soup when I was growing up, tomato and basil.
[57:02.700 --> 57:07.960]  That's a good soup. I feel like you have to be a grown-up to really enjoy it.
[57:07.960 --> 57:11.360]  Yeah, I remember as a kid just being like, ugh, I didn't like the smell of it.
[57:13.660 --> 57:19.960]  Episode 32. Oh, this one, I like the way he's made sure not to just blindly put them in.
[57:20.420 --> 57:24.800]  He's clarified, asked if he's not much of a bat guy by Geoff.
[57:25.420 --> 57:26.860]  I feel like that one doesn't really count.
[57:27.320 --> 57:29.920]  Yeah, I was going to say, I would say at that time, not a bat guy.
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.860]  At this point, I own like four bats. So I think I'm definitively a bat guy at this point.
[57:34.920 --> 57:35.360]  I have to be.
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.280]  Episode 33. The return of not a pants guy. The second mentioning.
[57:40.780 --> 57:44.720]  I need it to be known. That's how much I dislike pants. It needs multiple sayings.
[57:44.820 --> 57:48.280]  Do not accuse me of being a pants guy. It's not true.
[57:48.620 --> 57:53.440]  There was then a seven episode gap when you stated, I'm not a socks guy.
[57:54.120 --> 57:58.760]  Still true. Not a socks guy. Don't like him. It's like a prison on your feet. I don't like him.
[57:58.820 --> 57:59.940]  I like my feet to breathe.
[58:00.020 --> 58:02.280]  Coming from the guy with a bag of garlic straps.
[58:02.280 --> 58:05.780]  This is my commitment to the show. This isn't a thing I'd do.
[58:07.540 --> 58:10.840]  Oh, episode 41. Not the sound guy.
[58:11.260 --> 58:12.400]  I don't know what that means.
[58:13.220 --> 58:15.900]  Maybe we were dealing with, oh, that was in the interest of,
[58:15.940 --> 58:17.720]  we're probably dealing with your tech problems, I assume.
[58:18.140 --> 58:19.500]  Oh, that makes sense.
[58:20.060 --> 58:24.140]  You also said, not a social media guy. Coming from the guy who's been on social media
[58:24.140 --> 58:26.160]  for over a decade, I think.
[58:26.320 --> 58:28.760]  I don't know what that, what does that mean? What do you mean?
[58:29.160 --> 58:30.500]  You said you're not a social media guy.
[58:30.500 --> 58:33.540]  Yeah, but what does the, for a decade thing, what does that mean?
[58:33.840 --> 58:34.620]  Are you saying that I am?
[58:34.620 --> 58:34.740]  When did you get Twitter?
[58:35.160 --> 58:37.360]  Well, it doesn't matter when I got it. I barely use it.
[58:37.940 --> 58:40.580]  I like, I look at tweets. I'm not posting a lot.
[58:40.780 --> 58:42.680]  Almost everything I post is related to the show.
[58:43.020 --> 58:47.660]  I think I've had a Twitter account for 13 years and I have less than, I'd say, 700 tweets.
[58:48.540 --> 58:48.700]  700.
[58:48.700 --> 58:49.080]  Pretty low.
[58:49.260 --> 58:50.460]  I'd say you're a social media guy.
[58:50.940 --> 58:55.320]  Nah, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you 300 of those are show related.
[58:55.780 --> 58:57.080]  Oh, okay. Well, possibly.
[58:58.060 --> 59:03.040]  Episode 44, a mere four episodes after Not A Socks Guy,
[59:03.500 --> 59:05.880]  Andrew declares he is not a socks guy.
[59:06.580 --> 59:07.400]  Once again.
[59:07.660 --> 59:09.960]  Twice in the same episode, even.
[59:11.200 --> 59:16.660]  Andrew feels so strongly about restrictive clothing.
[59:17.160 --> 59:17.720]  I'm not a fan of it.
[59:17.800 --> 59:21.760]  That's three mentions of Not A Socks. Once in 40 and twice in 44.
[59:22.080 --> 59:24.780]  Episode 45, don't understand this one at all.
[59:24.780 --> 59:27.080]  Not a fine ideas guy.
[59:27.160 --> 59:31.400]  This is what I think it is. I've thought about this and I agree with this statement.
[59:31.760 --> 59:31.940]  What does that mean?
[59:32.380 --> 59:36.600]  So I'm a big fan of either terrible ideas or great ideas.
[59:36.920 --> 59:40.460]  I don't like a decent idea. A middle idea isn't that exciting.
[59:41.020 --> 59:46.940]  It's fine. That plan is a fine plan. I either want it to be a horrible plan or a great plan.
[59:47.480 --> 59:49.480]  I'm not a big fine ideas guy.
[59:50.020 --> 59:52.040]  Fine? You think that's all that means? Is that right?
[59:52.040 --> 59:55.960]  I think so. I haven't checked, but I'm assuming that's the context.
[59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.840]  Episode 46, not a hand towel guy.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.160]  I'd never use them. Don't need them. Unneeded.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:11.460]  Are you more of a Dyson Airblade or an accelerator guy? A blower guy?
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.060]  Or are you talking like in the bathroom at home, you just sort of shake your hands dry?
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.580]  Oh, you're shaking the hands. And yeah, if we're talking a food situation,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.920]  I'm not even a napkin guy. Don't need it. I'm careful with what I do.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.520]  I'm precise. I don't need any napkins.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:31.220]  Not a napkin guy. He's precise. I'm careful with what I do.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:38.480]  I make sure the sauce to food ratio is fine. It's not going to spill. If it does,
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.660]  then I just have to live with it. That's life. You have consequences for your actions.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.480]  When you stepped in a sushi container, I assume there was some residue in it.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.160]  How did you get that off?
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.880]  No, I don't think there was. I think it was just like a top.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.740]  It was the top. It was the cover part. I don't think there was anything there.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.520]  And if I did, I would have stepped in it. I'm probably just having a shower at that point.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.220]  We're washing it away.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.460]  You would say a paper towel is the tool of the imprecise then.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.040]  Well, a paper towel, I feel like has other uses than just culinary.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.580]  That's the thing you could wipe down all sorts of things with.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.240]  So yeah, I wouldn't say that. I don't think.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.100]  Episode 47. Not a butt doctor.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.400]  I feel like that's still true. Yeah, still factually correct.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.380]  Do you think that's the one where I declared that...
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:32.840]  Declared?!
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.020]  Declared, yeah. Tell me about how cars are barking at you again. Declared.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.580]  Was that the one where I said you have an anal fissure, you think?
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.500]  And then I double back?
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.920]  Yeah, I think that was the anal trenches era.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.280]  Probably, yeah.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.160]  Episode 49. This is a hell of a lot.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:56.300]  Not a big phone person. Not a hot... not a cold or hot... what does it say?
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.680]  Not a big phone person. Not a cold or room temperature cheese guy.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.620]  Not a big ham person.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.840]  All true. I don't use my phone all that often. I'm not big on apps on the phone.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.880]  I can't stay... if you're gonna have cheese on something, it better be melted.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.960]  There's nothing more disappointing to me than some room temperature cheese.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.240]  And then not a big ham person. Once again, sort of like the mayo.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:27.000]  I'm not gonna order it. If it's there, I'm fine with it.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:34.860]  Episode 51. Not a cold guy. So that is in with your...
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:39.920]  This is the thing. I need... yeah, I love the cold. I'm a big fan of the cold.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.720]  I don't know what this would be in reference to.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.540]  Well, I feel like it's similar to what you just said, where you say you don't get cold.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.740]  You're not a cold guy. Oh, that could be it.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.240]  You may decipher it. That could be it.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.500]  I do not get cold. Yeah, no, I think that might be right, Gavin.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.220]  That's a good call by you. That was my prediction anyway.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.120]  We'll have to verify these, obviously. Episode 52. Not an arts and crafts guy.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.980]  I think my basket shows otherwise. I think I've changed that.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.340]  I think it's clearly... I clearly am at this point.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.300]  Episode 53. Not a big mashed potato person.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.320]  See, this is the other thing. I am the biggest potato guy, maybe, in Canada.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.620]  I'm a big potato guy. I love a mashed potato.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.700]  That is a bold statement. You're the biggest potato guy in Canada.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.080]  I think so. I love a potato. I'll take a potato any meal.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.980]  You don't like it mashed? Is that what you're saying?
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.780]  No, I love mashed potatoes. I don't know what this is about.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.600]  I feel like this may have been... and I'm just gonna make a prediction here.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.160]  I was trying to make hash browns and they turned into mashed potatoes,
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.300]  and I didn't know how to then make mashed potatoes.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.260]  I don't really know how to make mashed potatoes,
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.000]  but I'll eat the fuck out of some mashed potatoes. I love a good mashed potato.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.680]  So it's more of a, I'm not a big mashed potatoes preparation person.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.840]  Yeah, I'm not a big mashed potato recipe guy is probably actually how that should read,
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.780]  I would assume, because I am a huge mashed potato guy.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.940]  Episode 56. Not a can guy.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.460]  Also true. Respect the can. I just don't drink many things out of a can.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.660]  Not a can guy.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.160]  A six episode break, and then episode 62, not a pasta guy.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.020]  Once again, true. Nothing against it. I just, not my rotation to foods all that often.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:18.800]  That's still true.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.540]  Fair play. So I remember this one. Episode 63, not a measuring guy.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.820]  I mean, I think Dinklage just says it all. We all have it. It's just not a thing I'm good at.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:34.780]  I feel like a really talented artist, comment leaver, or roosterteeth artist
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:40.440]  could make like a campaign style poster of Andrew, like, vote for Andrew,
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.000]  running for biggest potato guy in Canada. And then it could have all the,
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:50.720]  vote for Andrew, he's A, and then all of the things you are, and he's also not A.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.520]  This could be all of the attributes of your platforms.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.720]  It could just be a bunch of things with a little checkbox,
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.640]  and it's either X'd out or it's got a check through.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:00.740]  Yeah!
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.900]  Oh, I'm sorry. Good to meet you.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.220]  There's an X through heating, but a tick in cold.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.580]  I want one where I've reverse positioned like the frozen fruit, like it's an X,
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.280]  and then I'm like, it's a double.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.200]  It's like scribbled out.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.040]  That'd be an awesome poster. Oh, man.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.360]  Episode 65, not a big bike guy.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.960]  Specifically big bikes, apparently. I'm not a big bike guy.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.140]  I love a little bike, but not a big bike.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.180]  Which leads us directly into episode 66, not a big rules guy.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:45.380]  This is a real moral dilemma for me, because I think, I think that's true,
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:50.360]  but as I've also said, I'm a big recipe guy. I will follow that recipe to a T.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:56.720]  I will obey the laws of a recipe, but general rules, it's a little sometimes,
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.500]  they're dumb, sometimes there's some dumb rules.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.800]  Oh, an episode 68, not a knot guy.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:08.640]  Yeah, no, that's very true. So like tying knots, I think we talked about this before,
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:13.820]  I had boat safety grade five. I was like, I'm going to ace this fucking boat safety course.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.800]  I'm going to do amazing at it. There's a whole section on knots and I gave up.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.220]  That's the end of my pursuit of a perfect score. Can't do it.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.580]  So shout out to, uh, what's this username?
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.200]  Evil Lincoln. Evil Lincoln. Evi Lincoln.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.540]  I think you nailed it. One of the two. There's no way it's not one of the two things you said.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.100]  I'm glad you took the shot at it, Gavin, because I didn't know how to read it either.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.360]  I appreciate you making the attempt.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.640]  Yeah, it's like, uh, both words use the L, it looks like.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:52.500]  Yeah, dude, Evie, Evie, Evil, Evil Lincoln. Uh, thank you. That might have been the funniest
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.100]  segment in the history of this podcast.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.900]  We got some new, we got some new stuff out of it too.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.600]  Oh my reading. Yeah, we got new segments of the list. It honestly makes you sound like
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.360]  a complete psychopath. It does. Reading that back to back over the course of like over a year.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.120]  It's like, yeah, look at all this guy's rules.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:17.040]  Trying to make a mental picture of, of that person in your head while you're listening to it.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.000]  Yeah. Oh my God. I'd love to see that in a flow chart.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.120]  Oh, there's also like an additional section of stuff that you were unsure about,
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.880]  but I don't know if you want to get into that one.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.320]  I don't know, maybe we do that next time. There's not many of them.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.320]  Yeah. Oh yeah. That was good.
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.260]  Tears in my eyes. It's just so funny,
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:50.320]  it's a big list for some reason. It's, it's weird to think about that.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:53.120]  Like in the future, if I go back and listen to this episode,
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.380]  I'll just know that I had a bag of garlic taped to my feet.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.940]  I gotta be honest. I still don't taste garlic.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.960]  I thought I smelled it for a bit there when my nose got tickly, but...
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.200]  I have a mild taste. It's not as powerful as I want, but it's definitely, I smell it.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.920]  Like it's deep in the nose. I feel it there. Not much of a taste though.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.680]  I don't think that this could replace applying garlic to your food directly,
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.300]  is what I declare from this experiment.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.160]  Well, maybe, see that's, we can, that's the nice thing about the garlic patch,
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.640]  right? Or the foot flavor, the flavor foot, is we can increase the,
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.400]  we can increase the amount of garlic, the concentration of garlic or whatever that
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.480]  molecule is. And so that we can really just like, it's like when you take a vitamin B
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.700]  pill and it gives you like 1200% the daily recommended allotment.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:56.160]  We can just like, fucking just like, cram like, a way too dangerous amount of garlic
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.580]  into your body so that you really get a sense of it.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.420]  Should I try to take this bag off as we end the show? I'm assuming we're at the end.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.000]  Oh yeah, in the episode?
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.800]  Yeah, should I try to take it off right now?
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.520]  I'm definitely gonna clean my foot off.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.560]  What was that?
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.500]  This is not easy.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.460]  Oh, oh, it smells so garlicky.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.180]  Okay, we're wrapping.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.400]  I don't know what you were expecting.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.380]  I guess Gavin and I just had a great idea for a prank.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:58.440]  Oh, do you know how when you're a kid and you have sleepovers and you'll like,
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.460]  put somebody's hand in warm water to make them pee the bed?
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:08.540]  We should start garlic bagging people's feet and then see if they wake up from
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.440]  garlic's taste in their mouth.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.380]  Oh, like garlic masks for the foot.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.080]  Oh, I got hiccups.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.380]  Oh, man, that was disgusting.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:28.280]  Hey, thank you for listening to another episode of the Faced podcast.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:33.740]  Surviving members, Geoff Ramsey and Gavin Frey.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.940]  Rest in peace, Andrew Panton, Raymond Sommer, Vancouver Child Kicker,
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.680]  and many of your other colorful nom de plumes.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.940]  As always, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend about it.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.320]  We really could use the help.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:55.260]  We exist pretty much as a company by word of mouth and certainly as a podcast as well.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.120]  And this isn't going to be one of those ones where I talk forever to
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.400]  annoy Eric because he's not even here.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.820]  So I'll just say love you.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.200]  Bye.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:01.740]  Bye.
