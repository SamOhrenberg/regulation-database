[00:36.910 --> 00:39.790]  Is this Face? Did we start? Yeah, I think we started.
[00:39.790 --> 00:44.650]  Welcome to F*** Face episode 74. There we go, it's started. No, it's 75.
[00:45.910 --> 00:52.390]  75, part 2, act 7, season 3? 2? What season are we on?
[00:52.410 --> 00:56.750]  Season 2, year 2, episode 75. How many episodes of season 1 and
[00:56.750 --> 01:01.950]  how many episodes are we into for season 2? I don't expect anyone to actually know,
[01:02.010 --> 01:05.430]  I'm just kind of saying that. Are we at the mid-season finale yet?
[01:05.430 --> 01:10.870]  That's the thing, did you, so when I got Disney+, one of the most fascinating things was seeing how
[01:10.870 --> 01:16.890]  they did seasons for kids shows. There will be like 700 episodes in season 1, and then season 2
[01:16.890 --> 01:20.890]  is 6. Like, I don't know how they decide that line, I feel like that's what we're doing.
[01:21.490 --> 01:26.730]  We'll have a million episodes in season 3, and season 4 will be 4. Just break it up,
[01:26.790 --> 01:30.550]  have it be completely uneven, nonsensical. Which fits for the show.
[01:31.010 --> 01:32.730]  Yeah, that's true. Speaking of fitting for the show,
[01:32.730 --> 01:36.330]  does anybody have any fruit-related content they wanted to throw out?
[01:36.630 --> 01:38.130]  I don't, but I... I'm all fruited out.
[01:38.470 --> 01:43.130]  Oh, we're all fruited out? I am equally fruited out, but I do have
[01:43.130 --> 01:49.170]  a very serious question for Gavin, and I've talked to... this just blew my mind,
[01:49.490 --> 01:52.850]  and I shouldn't even... when do you think the high-five was invented, Gavin?
[01:55.130 --> 01:57.170]  We did talk about this yesterday.
[01:58.650 --> 02:02.110]  What year? What year do you think the high-five was
[02:02.110 --> 02:04.990]  invented? 600.
[02:05.910 --> 02:08.890]  The year 600? That's your guess?
[02:09.910 --> 02:12.670]  AD or BC? Yeah, that's another great question.
[02:12.670 --> 02:15.090]  AD. Who doesn't specify BC?
[02:15.370 --> 02:21.290]  So in your... so you... so in your mind, assuming Jesus existed,
[02:21.430 --> 02:23.370]  he existed in a world without a high-five.
[02:26.970 --> 02:28.670]  Okay, just want to make sure.
[02:29.130 --> 02:31.230]  Oh, so it's got to be way earlier than that.
[02:31.710 --> 02:33.130]  I don't know. I'm just curious.
[02:34.150 --> 02:37.770]  Well, I feel like... were people really tracking that in... you know,
[02:37.790 --> 02:42.610]  if it was 2500 BC, would anyone be like... invented the high-five today?
[02:46.660 --> 02:48.140]  Oh, shit. I have no...
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.460]  Okay, I'm going to re-guess.
[02:52.720 --> 02:53.440]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:54.100 --> 02:54.440]  10.
[02:55.000 --> 02:55.240]  10.
[03:01.480 --> 03:04.140]  You're so wrong. You're so far off.
[03:04.660 --> 03:08.300]  I thought you'd get... I thought you'd get closer on the second one.
[03:08.580 --> 03:09.320]  You got further!
[03:09.740 --> 03:12.840]  And there wasn't a lot of room to get further away, but you did!
[03:16.060 --> 03:21.080]  I was watching... so for context, I was watching a playoff baseball game
[03:21.080 --> 03:24.260]  between the Houston Astros and the White Sox.
[03:25.060 --> 03:25.640]  And uh...
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.640]  Fuck the Astros, by the way.
[03:26.980 --> 03:27.780]  Fuck the Astros.
[03:28.240 --> 03:30.400]  The announcers, in like, late in the game,
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.900]  just randomly throw out like,
[03:32.100 --> 03:36.360]  oh yeah, manager of the Astros, Dusty Baker, inventor of the high-five.
[03:37.020 --> 03:42.680]  Dusty Baker, apparently, invented the high-five in 1977, Gavin.
[03:43.360 --> 03:44.360]  Absolutely not.
[03:44.780 --> 03:46.380]  That's... that's the...
[03:46.380 --> 03:47.960]  No, that's the immediate reaction.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.960]  The people were like, storming Normandy before the high-five?
[03:52.320 --> 03:55.540]  Yeah, the high-five was not a popular thing.
[03:55.780 --> 03:58.360]  They were storming Normandy with no way to celebrate.
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.820]  They just... they did it, they got through, and they were just like, oh yay, I guess.
[04:04.380 --> 04:05.680]  They... they just shook hands.
[04:06.140 --> 04:08.140]  It was the low-five. Now that's the thing,
[04:08.200 --> 04:13.060]  the low-five has been around since the 20s, I believe, in the history research that I've done.
[04:13.220 --> 04:19.280]  He's saying that no one before that has ever just spun their two hats together.
[04:19.720 --> 04:22.740]  No, no, now that's... that's another divisive point.
[04:23.100 --> 04:27.080]  Now they're... Dusty Baker is the most common, like, inventor of it.
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.940]  There are other documentations of high-fives before that point,
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.680]  but I don't think they were called the high-five, and I don't think it was, like, their thing.
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.740]  It was maybe a thing they did once.
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.860]  So he just named the high-five.
[04:39.200 --> 04:41.920]  No, he didn't name it. He... I would argue they popular...
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.700]  Here, I'm just going to read you an excerpt of the first high-five that happened, okay?
[04:47.460 --> 04:51.820]  The conventional wisdom has been that the origin of the high-five occurred between Dusty Baker
[04:51.820 --> 04:56.740]  and Glenn Burke of the L.A. Dodgers at Dodgers Stadium, October 2nd, 1977.
[04:57.260 --> 04:59.060]  How did they both know how to do it?
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.680]  No, this... I'm getting to that!
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.720]  The last day of the regular season, in the sixth inning, Dusty Baker hit a home run
[05:05.720 --> 05:08.040]  off Houston Astros pitcher J.R. Richard.
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.640]  It was Baker's 30th home run, making the Dodgers the first team in history
[05:11.640 --> 05:13.580]  to have four hitters with at least 30 home runs.
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.440]  It was a wild, triumphant moment and a good omen as the Dodgers headed to the playoffs.
[05:18.440 --> 05:19.780]  Burke waited on deck,
[05:20.380 --> 05:23.620]  thrust his hand enthusiastically over his head to greet his friend at the plate.
[05:24.120 --> 05:27.220]  Baker, not knowing what to do, smacked it.
[05:27.620 --> 05:32.120]  In quotes, his hand was up in the air and he was arching way back, says Baker.
[05:32.340 --> 05:35.500]  So I reached up and hit his hand. It seemed like the thing to do.
[05:35.840 --> 05:37.800]  That is the origin. He didn't know what to do.
[05:38.140 --> 05:40.720]  I've been left hanging in the year, like, 2020.
[05:42.320 --> 05:45.540]  No one had ever done a high-five and he wasn't left hanging.
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.300]  It blew my mind.
[05:47.900 --> 05:50.960]  No, there are other people, like, I've read a thing that apparently
[05:50.960 --> 05:54.900]  Magic Johnson also claims that he invented the high-five in, like, 1978.
[05:55.300 --> 05:57.640]  There are different stories, there are different origins,
[05:57.780 --> 05:58.900]  there are different things he could point to.
[05:59.120 --> 06:03.620]  But the most popularized version, the most popularized invention
[06:03.620 --> 06:06.280]  or the person who invented it is Dusty Baker.
[06:06.880 --> 06:09.160]  Dusty Baker is credited as the high-five guy.
[06:09.240 --> 06:09.960]  I'm blown away.
[06:10.340 --> 06:11.120]  I was blown away.
[06:11.120 --> 06:17.500]  I was telling Andrew, it's kind of like how the mullet hairstyle
[06:17.500 --> 06:19.500]  has been around for a very, very long time.
[06:19.560 --> 06:20.880]  It was super popular in the 80s.
[06:20.960 --> 06:24.760]  But it wasn't called the mullet until the Beastie Boys did it in 1994.
[06:25.960 --> 06:29.560]  I was in the army before the mullet became the mullet.
[06:29.680 --> 06:32.500]  And I would assume that was, like, 100 years ago.
[06:32.580 --> 06:34.160]  So imagine the Beatles.
[06:34.840 --> 06:36.560]  They all just got out of a car.
[06:36.620 --> 06:38.020]  There's a big crowd waiting for them.
[06:38.440 --> 06:40.000]  The crowd, they've all got their hands in the air.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.120]  The Beatles just walk by.
[06:41.720 --> 06:41.780]  Yeah.
[06:42.780 --> 06:44.280]  Not been invented yet.
[06:44.420 --> 06:46.920]  It's not a thing that's, yeah, hasn't been invented yet.
[06:47.320 --> 06:47.720]  Nobody knows.
[06:47.720 --> 06:48.840]  Maybe a low five.
[06:49.300 --> 06:52.320]  A low five, very much invented, popularized.
[06:52.700 --> 06:54.200]  Not the high five.
[06:54.340 --> 06:56.380]  The high five is a relatively new creation.
[06:56.880 --> 06:57.780]  I was way off.
[06:58.120 --> 07:00.240]  You were way off and then you went even further away.
[07:01.180 --> 07:01.880]  That's fantastic.
[07:03.440 --> 07:05.820]  I was thinking of, like, schools.
[07:05.980 --> 07:07.700]  I was like, when was the first school?
[07:10.000 --> 07:10.960]  They're just low five.
[07:11.140 --> 07:11.620]  Oh, my God.
[07:11.960 --> 07:14.320]  I can say something that y'all can't say.
[07:14.700 --> 07:16.820]  I am older than the high five.
[07:17.160 --> 07:17.440]  You are.
[07:19.800 --> 07:20.200]  Wow.
[07:20.980 --> 07:24.340]  What year did you say the Beastie Boys coined the term mullet?
[07:24.660 --> 07:25.060]  1994.
[07:25.760 --> 07:27.340]  So I'm the same age as the mullet.
[07:27.520 --> 07:28.740]  You're the same age as the mullet.
[07:28.760 --> 07:30.700]  And I'm two years older than the high five.
[07:31.080 --> 07:31.300]  Yeah.
[07:32.440 --> 07:36.540]  I feel like if you said that, people would think, damn, he looks good for his age.
[07:36.860 --> 07:38.880]  If you're like, I'm two years older than the high five.
[07:38.880 --> 07:41.300]  Nobody would assume like you're 70.
[07:41.460 --> 07:42.500]  You look great for 70.
[07:43.500 --> 07:45.360]  What do you think the next thing will be then?
[07:45.420 --> 07:49.780]  There's potentially going to be something in the future more universal than the high five,
[07:49.860 --> 07:50.720]  but it hasn't happened yet.
[07:51.220 --> 07:53.980]  I mean, COVID has been a terrible thing for the high five.
[07:55.220 --> 07:57.980]  It has really hurt the popularity, I would assume.
[07:58.500 --> 07:59.440]  Here's what I think.
[07:59.600 --> 08:02.580]  I think that it provides and this actually dovetails into something that I'm going to
[08:02.580 --> 08:03.120]  talk about later.
[08:03.640 --> 08:08.000]  But this, I think that there is a there's a market for the next thing.
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.580]  And we've already identified that that it wasn't that long ago that you could flip the
[08:14.580 --> 08:18.540]  world on its shoulders by slapping two hands together.
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.140]  So I think it's up to us to determine what the new high five is and to popularize it.
[08:24.720 --> 08:25.700]  It has to be simple.
[08:25.940 --> 08:26.680]  It has to be.
[08:26.740 --> 08:27.540]  It's got to be simple.
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.300]  When was that playground game invented where the kids would like, you know, you clap yourself
[08:32.300 --> 08:36.000]  and then you clap the other person's hand and you clap school girls.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.800]  Yeah, that was October 24th, 1967.
[08:40.280 --> 08:41.300]  Like, what do you fucking mean?
[08:41.380 --> 08:42.060]  When did it come out?
[08:42.320 --> 08:45.960]  Like, surely way before the high five for the high five and left and right in that.
[08:46.480 --> 08:48.680]  No, it's like a mid five, a mid five.
[08:49.700 --> 08:50.780]  That's a chess five.
[08:50.860 --> 08:51.940]  That's a chess pass five.
[08:52.520 --> 08:53.620]  Maybe that's what it is.
[08:53.680 --> 08:55.160]  Maybe maybe the chest five.
[08:56.180 --> 08:59.260]  No, maybe we popularize the mid five.
[09:00.940 --> 09:02.680]  Like our high five, our high.
[09:02.760 --> 09:04.340]  We've been flying a little too high.
[09:04.340 --> 09:09.700]  The hubris alone the last 40 years or so, like maybe we need to take it down a notch
[09:10.620 --> 09:12.040]  physically, metaphorically, metaphysically.
[09:12.200 --> 09:13.960]  Maybe we should start mid fiving.
[09:14.540 --> 09:15.120]  You know what I mean?
[09:15.520 --> 09:19.780]  Now, do we need to do like it's back of the hand, like two backs in the hands for the high five?
[09:19.780 --> 09:23.020]  Because I feel like it needs to mechanically be different than just a high five.
[09:23.140 --> 09:25.860]  But then again, the low five, the high five, same thing mechanically.
[09:25.980 --> 09:27.600]  So maybe we don't.
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.560]  I think maybe touching hands going forward is a problem because of germs and stuff.
[09:32.560 --> 09:34.480]  Who invented the fist bump?
[09:35.220 --> 09:36.200]  That's what I was going to say.
[09:36.260 --> 09:37.560]  I don't know who invented the fist bump.
[09:37.700 --> 09:41.760]  I read Dusty Baker encouraging long distance high fives, which I feel like you only say
[09:41.760 --> 09:43.860]  if you're the inventor of the high five and you really want it.
[09:44.200 --> 09:45.980]  Yeah, you're just it's a stretch.
[09:45.980 --> 09:48.300]  The long distance high five is a stretch.
[09:49.040 --> 09:49.180]  Yeah.
[09:49.620 --> 09:50.640]  Who invented the fist bump?
[09:50.740 --> 09:51.220]  I don't know.
[09:51.420 --> 09:52.140]  It's a great question.
[09:52.660 --> 09:54.300]  We just need to figure out what the next thing is.
[09:54.360 --> 09:55.660]  People do elbow touches.
[09:56.400 --> 09:57.940]  Well, I mean, we're doing the jet ski one.
[09:58.500 --> 09:59.860]  We're going to do jet ski five.
[10:00.200 --> 10:00.500]  Yeah.
[10:01.300 --> 10:04.380]  I'd love to see somebody do a home run and then do a jet ski five.
[10:04.660 --> 10:07.200]  We're going to we're definitely going to elevate the high five.
[10:07.420 --> 10:11.100]  But we need to be thinking of what the new high five is that then we can take credit
[10:11.100 --> 10:12.280]  for and popularize, right?
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.360]  Like Dusty Baker did.
[10:13.760 --> 10:17.080]  We like maybe it's like a like a knee knock.
[10:17.740 --> 10:20.040]  You just walk up and like I don't know.
[10:20.760 --> 10:22.280]  I don't I don't like that.
[10:22.800 --> 10:23.840]  Maybe a toe touch.
[10:23.860 --> 10:26.400]  But then that's how dudes find each other in bathrooms at the airport.
[10:26.480 --> 10:27.940]  So maybe that could be confusing.
[10:28.380 --> 10:28.780]  I don't know.
[10:28.960 --> 10:29.460]  Wait, what?
[10:29.460 --> 10:31.240]  Oh, you don't know about that?
[10:31.440 --> 10:34.420]  Yeah, like there have been a bunch of politicians that have gotten caught doing it in the past.
[10:34.800 --> 10:38.780]  It was a popular thing to do when it wasn't as well.
[10:38.880 --> 10:43.140]  Well, for people that are closeted or it wasn't as socially acceptable to be out and
[10:43.140 --> 10:47.940]  proud and gay, dudes sometimes would go into certain bathrooms and you would sit on the
[10:47.940 --> 10:51.300]  stall and you would like touch the foot or like stick your foot under the thing.
[10:51.380 --> 10:55.180]  And then if the other guy touched it, then you would know that that and you were into
[10:55.180 --> 10:57.380]  the same stuff and then you could get to know each other.
[10:57.380 --> 11:04.140]  Yeah, it was I think a senator or a congressman got caught doing it in the 90s or early 2000s.
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.060]  Was that just like a reporter taking a shit and then the book came out?
[11:08.260 --> 11:10.420]  I think I think I think I think somebody.
[11:10.720 --> 11:11.800]  Yeah, I think something like that.
[11:12.020 --> 11:14.020]  I just know that that's a thing that was was done.
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.200]  So well, first off, let's let's take it back for a minute.
[11:18.340 --> 11:19.580]  What is a high?
[11:19.640 --> 11:21.300]  What is the expression of a high five?
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.960]  What are you trying to convey with a high five?
[11:23.380 --> 11:24.700]  Oh, it's celebration, right?
[11:24.700 --> 11:26.240]  Celebration and excitement.
[11:26.780 --> 11:27.300]  Accomplishment.
[11:27.940 --> 11:30.300]  Somebody has achieved a good thing.
[11:30.620 --> 11:33.780]  Yeah, because I typically I relate it to sports, but it could be beyond that.
[11:33.940 --> 11:38.520]  I think it's just so celebrating the act of someone you could high five cooking good bread.
[11:38.620 --> 11:39.320]  It could be anything.
[11:39.840 --> 11:49.860]  But so yeah, so we we need to we need to find the new the 2021 to lead us into the future
[11:49.860 --> 11:52.660]  to lead to so that we're 2051 people are still doing it.
[11:52.660 --> 11:54.400]  We need to find the new thing.
[11:54.620 --> 12:00.180]  That's a way to express ourselves physically with another person that is simple and safe
[12:00.180 --> 12:05.060]  and doesn't transmit germs and diseases, but is still super cool and hip and fun
[12:05.060 --> 12:09.100]  and maybe makes noise because if you do a good high five, there's a pretty awesome slap.
[12:09.480 --> 12:11.080]  The slap is so satisfying.
[12:11.540 --> 12:15.640]  That's my biggest issue with the long distance high five is the best part is that contact
[12:15.640 --> 12:17.080]  doesn't work otherwise.
[12:17.140 --> 12:17.380]  I agree.
[12:17.520 --> 12:21.680]  I I feel like this could be a great thing for the common leaders to help figure out.
[12:21.680 --> 12:25.460]  They want to submit pitches like that could be a good move.
[12:25.580 --> 12:26.920]  Sounds like Geoff's already figured it out.
[12:27.640 --> 12:28.980]  Do you? Because I feel like what?
[12:29.100 --> 12:30.360]  So what is it a mid five?
[12:30.480 --> 12:31.220]  Is that what we're talking?
[12:31.320 --> 12:32.660]  No, I don't think it's a mid five.
[12:32.740 --> 12:33.420]  I don't know what it is.
[12:33.440 --> 12:37.180]  I just I just I just think that you you start at the beginning and you figure out what you're
[12:37.180 --> 12:39.140]  trying to do and then go from there.
[12:39.220 --> 12:42.360]  What we're trying to do is find a new way to celebrate an accomplishment or an exciting
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.860]  moment without being living in the past or paying royalties to Dusty Baker.
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.080]  And it needs a sound.
[12:48.540 --> 12:49.780]  Yeah, it doesn't got to have a sound.
[12:49.780 --> 12:52.500]  And it has most likely contactless.
[12:52.660 --> 12:53.940]  So that's another layer, too.
[12:54.500 --> 12:56.280]  I think we should have it be contactless.
[12:56.360 --> 12:57.040]  Just workshop.
[12:57.180 --> 12:58.540]  This covers everything.
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.920]  There's no scenario at that point where you couldn't do it.
[13:01.300 --> 13:03.460]  Can you guys do that thing where you put your finger in your mouth and go like this?
[13:06.200 --> 13:07.200]  Maybe we do that.
[13:07.380 --> 13:07.880]  You just walk.
[13:07.920 --> 13:08.380]  Yeah, just walk.
[13:08.500 --> 13:11.400]  Next time you want to high five, just go at the same time.
[13:11.580 --> 13:12.540]  It makes a noise.
[13:12.940 --> 13:14.660]  Let's try not to spread germs.
[13:14.800 --> 13:16.520]  Hey, everyone, put your finger in your mouth.
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.820]  And then fish rake it out.
[13:22.600 --> 13:24.140]  Yeah, maybe that's not the best one.
[13:24.380 --> 13:25.940]  We'll put our fingers in each other's mouths.
[13:26.560 --> 13:27.500]  Well, that's not bad.
[13:27.700 --> 13:28.000]  That's interesting.
[13:28.800 --> 13:36.140]  If you can make that noise in someone else's mouth, I'd be very impressed.
[13:39.400 --> 13:40.400]  What's more impressive?
[13:40.600 --> 13:44.960]  Eating an entire bar of 100% Lindt chocolate or whatever that was?
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.820]  I think if you could first time put your finger in someone's mouth and make the pop sound,
[13:50.400 --> 13:51.860]  that's way more impressive.
[13:52.520 --> 13:53.640]  Can I try on you?
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.420]  You got to wash your finger first.
[13:58.880 --> 14:00.620]  Yeah, I thought that was assumed.
[14:02.180 --> 14:06.780]  We can discuss the ground rules ahead of time if you want to.
[14:07.200 --> 14:08.760]  But I assumed I would wash my hands.
[14:08.840 --> 14:09.860]  What if I put on a glove?
[14:10.220 --> 14:12.240]  What if I put on a rubber glove?
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.080]  Yeah, I think the extra grip might cause the noise to change, though.
[14:18.440 --> 14:19.580]  Well, we'll figure this out.
[14:19.740 --> 14:21.680]  We can cover this when we're in person.
[14:21.860 --> 14:26.460]  Imagine if we both put our fingers in each other's mouths and then got a double pop.
[14:27.020 --> 14:28.280]  At the same time.
[14:28.400 --> 14:32.500]  That, to me, in a post-COVID world, will be the ultimate high five.
[14:33.860 --> 14:37.260]  I don't know if I've ever respected Gavin more than him,
[14:37.460 --> 14:40.640]  Geoff, suggesting that he put a glove on to put hands in your mouth.
[14:40.640 --> 14:43.580]  And your response was it might damage the sound.
[14:43.680 --> 14:45.900]  It might break the integrity of the pop.
[14:46.120 --> 14:47.780]  Well, we want to make this count.
[14:49.960 --> 14:52.440]  We should also make sure we cut our fingernails.
[14:53.100 --> 14:54.120]  Oh, that's another.
[14:54.340 --> 14:55.460]  Yeah, that's important.
[14:55.840 --> 14:56.020]  Yeah.
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.900]  Oh, I'm I'm honestly, I'm so up for trying that.
[15:00.040 --> 15:00.820]  I am, too.
[15:00.880 --> 15:02.670]  I'm pretty excited about it, to be honest with you.
[15:05.600 --> 15:06.800]  I'm just sitting here practicing.
[15:07.600 --> 15:13.140]  So should we talk about, like, one of the actual things we planned on talking about and not?
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.120]  Because we're like almost 20 minutes into Dusty Baker.
[15:17.600 --> 15:18.880]  We talked about the high five.
[15:19.220 --> 15:20.640]  Why is that so funny to me?
[15:21.320 --> 15:22.200]  I don't know.
[15:22.280 --> 15:23.140]  It's pretty fucking funny.
[15:28.860 --> 15:29.460]  Andrew.
[15:29.980 --> 15:30.380]  Geoff.
[15:30.480 --> 15:30.800]  Andrew.
[15:31.340 --> 15:31.760]  Geoff.
[15:31.880 --> 15:35.040]  A long time ago, you came to me.
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.820]  A long time ago now.
[15:37.440 --> 15:39.260]  It feels like six months ago.
[15:39.320 --> 15:41.240]  Yeah, at least three or four months ago.
[15:41.320 --> 15:42.680]  It's probably like you came to me.
[15:42.980 --> 15:46.320]  You came to me with something that you read that I thought was insane.
[15:46.640 --> 15:48.320]  And then we started talking about it.
[15:48.360 --> 15:50.660]  And I think we came up with a brilliant idea.
[15:50.940 --> 15:52.100]  And then we teased it.
[15:52.200 --> 15:56.480]  And then other important Apple related things got in the way.
[15:56.900 --> 16:01.260]  And fast forward to like months of banana content later.
[16:01.300 --> 16:01.880]  And here we are.
[16:01.880 --> 16:07.580]  Do you want to explain what superheroes means and how it relates to fuckface?
[16:08.100 --> 16:09.780]  So yes, the superhero thing.
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.460]  It's really there is a an NPR podcast named Planet Money.
[16:13.560 --> 16:14.760]  And they tried this thing.
[16:14.820 --> 16:17.700]  They wanted to see if they could buy a superhero was essentially the idea.
[16:17.820 --> 16:18.880]  And they couldn't.
[16:18.940 --> 16:20.020]  Like they couldn't get why.
[16:20.080 --> 16:21.400]  Why did they want to buy a superhero?
[16:21.880 --> 16:24.420]  It's just like representation of the thing.
[16:24.460 --> 16:28.360]  Because like there's so many superheroes, especially in the larger company's catalog.
[16:28.500 --> 16:30.900]  And that you could essentially lease it out if you wanted to.
[16:30.900 --> 16:35.360]  Just having in a world in which franchises are important and superheroes are everywhere.
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.980]  It couldn't be a bad thing to have your own superhero.
[16:38.260 --> 16:39.760]  And there are so many available.
[16:39.880 --> 16:45.220]  The question was, could you acquire a superhero that nobody really knows about or cares about?
[16:45.360 --> 16:46.240]  And it wouldn't.
[16:46.300 --> 16:47.220]  It just was impossible.
[16:47.700 --> 16:49.900]  They were unable to largely because of Groot.
[16:50.420 --> 16:51.980]  Groot is like the example of a character.
[16:52.160 --> 16:53.880]  Nobody gave a fuck about that.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.880]  Disney now makes hundreds of millions of merchandise with the future.
[16:57.980 --> 17:00.520]  So it's like it's just it's not worth whatever you'd buy for it.
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.440]  We are in sort of an interesting position of Rooster Teeth's tie to DC.
[17:05.960 --> 17:08.400]  We're in the inside already, in a sense.
[17:08.920 --> 17:14.400]  So the idea, I guess, at that time was if we could then, since we're already on the inside,
[17:14.540 --> 17:15.780]  could we get our own superhero?
[17:16.320 --> 17:22.300]  Well, the idea being it was a response out of necessity because you thought,
[17:22.520 --> 17:23.700]  oh, it's cool.
[17:23.820 --> 17:29.300]  Planet Money is trying to essentially buy a superhero to be their new mascot or logo.
[17:29.300 --> 17:33.540]  But what I'm seeing, I'm seeing a troubling, a really troubling trend.
[17:33.620 --> 17:34.460]  I've watched the boys.
[17:34.800 --> 17:35.860]  I know where this goes.
[17:36.100 --> 17:41.340]  I'm seeing that Planet Money is now going to have a leg up on every other brand
[17:41.340 --> 17:44.040]  because they have a superhero to defend them.
[17:44.480 --> 17:44.740]  Sure.
[17:45.620 --> 17:47.340]  Not physically, of course, right?
[17:47.360 --> 17:48.440]  But we don't know that.
[17:48.660 --> 17:53.140]  I feel like if Planet Money and all these other entities are going to be out there
[17:53.140 --> 17:56.400]  hiring and buying superheroes to be their own ambassadors,
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.920]  f***face needs a superhero to defend us and defend our brand against these other brands.
[18:02.080 --> 18:03.860]  I feel like it's a necessity at this point.
[18:04.180 --> 18:05.120]  No, I completely agree.
[18:05.580 --> 18:10.080]  And so I said at that time, it was months ago, that we should all look,
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.960]  we should all try to find the best DC character we could find that fits our idea.
[18:15.140 --> 18:16.560]  It can't be a popular character.
[18:16.940 --> 18:18.600]  We're not going to be able to acquire Batman.
[18:18.800 --> 18:19.560]  We're not getting Batman.
[18:19.940 --> 18:23.760]  But what is like an obscure, hard to find character?
[18:23.760 --> 18:26.820]  So that is a thing we all, I think, independently did, or at least I did.
[18:27.000 --> 18:27.820]  We talked about it.
[18:28.220 --> 18:30.140]  I feel like we should present our examples.
[18:30.580 --> 18:31.300]  OK, that's great.
[18:31.480 --> 18:34.980]  I'll say I went to the powers that be and I said, hey, we have this idea.
[18:35.020 --> 18:35.560]  We want to do this.
[18:36.240 --> 18:39.040]  Can you talk to Warner Brothers and see if they'll give us a superhero?
[18:39.380 --> 18:40.480]  And they said, who's the superhero?
[18:40.560 --> 18:41.680]  And I said, well, we haven't gotten that yet.
[18:41.700 --> 18:43.080]  And they said, this is a stupid idea.
[18:43.120 --> 18:46.380]  And they're probably going to say no, but at least come back to us with a superhero.
[18:46.560 --> 18:51.640]  So then we decided I sent out a link of lesser known superheroes.
[18:51.740 --> 18:52.780]  And I thought we'd all go through.
[18:52.780 --> 18:54.500]  And what was the plan to pick ten each?
[18:54.620 --> 18:55.420]  I think I think it was.
[18:55.560 --> 18:58.060]  Yeah, like that seemed like a lot after I went through the list.
[18:58.160 --> 18:58.820]  I have three.
[18:59.020 --> 19:00.040]  Yeah, I have three.
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.780]  And there's really one I believe in truly that I think is a perfect encapsulation of this show.
[19:05.920 --> 19:09.440]  It honestly makes me a little bit worried about your future, Geoff, in a sense.
[19:09.580 --> 19:12.360]  OK, OK, I'm very excited about it.
[19:12.400 --> 19:14.520]  I think there's a clear number one, but I have three.
[19:14.540 --> 19:16.000]  OK, I know how many you guys have.
[19:16.060 --> 19:17.080]  Well, why don't you go first?
[19:17.340 --> 19:21.780]  OK, I assume I'm the only one that did any research for this is my.
[19:21.780 --> 19:25.460]  You shouldn't assume that, but we've had months to do it on this.
[19:25.580 --> 19:26.060]  We have.
[19:26.200 --> 19:27.560]  I thought we're going to do this.
[19:27.660 --> 19:28.460]  I like crammed.
[19:28.540 --> 19:29.840]  I mentioned like four episodes ago.
[19:29.900 --> 19:30.540]  I cram homework.
[19:30.700 --> 19:33.340]  Yeah, so this is this is my first one.
[19:33.420 --> 19:36.140]  I don't think this is these are some of them I just think are great.
[19:36.400 --> 19:37.720]  I'm not saying we should pursue this.
[19:38.180 --> 19:41.280]  There is a an issue of a comic that is the gorilla.
[19:41.360 --> 19:42.680]  One is strange sports stories.
[19:42.760 --> 19:43.940]  The gorilla wonders of the diamond.
[19:44.660 --> 19:48.500]  Look at how happy that fucking monkey is sliding into the play.
[19:48.940 --> 19:50.920]  It just brings joy to my heart.
[19:52.060 --> 19:53.040]  Stealing a base.
[19:54.700 --> 19:58.860]  I don't feel like they would be missing anything if we took the gorilla wonders of the diamonds.
[19:59.040 --> 20:00.720]  I don't think that's a big loss for D.C.
[20:01.080 --> 20:02.820]  OK, so Gorilla Wonders of the Diamond.
[20:03.140 --> 20:05.800]  His name is Gorilla Wonders of the Diamond.
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.160]  It's a whole team.
[20:07.460 --> 20:08.080]  The entire team.
[20:08.220 --> 20:08.980]  It's an entire baseball.
[20:09.520 --> 20:11.700]  We're buying a gorilla based baseball team.
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.200]  OK, yeah, it's all about these super smart gorillas that end up falling in love with baseball
[20:16.200 --> 20:19.780]  for no real reason, but they become obsessed with it and then they enter a league and they just
[20:19.780 --> 20:22.620]  dominate. They're the greatest baseball team in that league.
[20:23.020 --> 20:27.960]  Well, listen, in a world where we learned to skateboard from monkeys, I think this makes
[20:27.960 --> 20:28.500]  total sense.
[20:28.800 --> 20:29.200]  It does.
[20:29.320 --> 20:34.620]  Now, the second one, and I just I personally, this just makes me laugh at the character's
[20:34.620 --> 20:35.900]  name is the printer's devil.
[20:36.660 --> 20:38.960]  He is in two issues of Detective Comics.
[20:38.980 --> 20:40.720]  He's in 539 and 540.
[20:41.040 --> 20:42.200]  This is what he looks like.
[20:42.880 --> 20:46.200]  Essentially, this character, he's a sports writer.
[20:46.880 --> 20:49.440]  He's a sports columnist at the paper.
[20:49.780 --> 20:52.440]  And the paper is like, oh, we're going to sell our company.
[20:52.700 --> 20:54.360]  And he's like, we can't have that.
[20:54.800 --> 20:56.100]  That could fuck everything up.
[20:56.220 --> 21:01.480]  So he buys a goat mask and a trident and he starts causing mischief and he ends up canceling
[21:01.480 --> 21:01.960]  out the sale.
[21:03.260 --> 21:04.180]  That's his whole thing.
[21:04.240 --> 21:08.540]  He's just a guy with a goat mask and a trident and he's trying to smooth the new owners.
[21:09.300 --> 21:11.260]  No, it's just it's Tom.
[21:11.640 --> 21:12.900]  It'd be like in Scooby-Doo.
[21:12.960 --> 21:13.580]  They amassed him.
[21:13.660 --> 21:14.200]  Oh, it's Tom.
[21:14.280 --> 21:15.080]  He covers sports.
[21:15.400 --> 21:17.200]  He's a beat writer for the local team.
[21:17.660 --> 21:18.800]  His trident is a gun.
[21:19.300 --> 21:21.380]  It's a trident dart gun thing.
[21:21.460 --> 21:22.440]  Like, it's not even real.
[21:22.460 --> 21:23.800]  It's just like the corniest.
[21:24.440 --> 21:25.660]  He's just he's a guy.
[21:25.860 --> 21:29.220]  He's a guy that went to a Halloween store, bought a goat mask and a cape.
[21:29.540 --> 21:30.840]  He also got like a hoof boots.
[21:31.340 --> 21:34.500]  He's a disgruntled employee who stopped at the Spirit Halloween store.
[21:34.900 --> 21:37.800]  So this is we're on to the number one.
[21:37.900 --> 21:40.060]  This is I'm so excited about this.
[21:40.100 --> 21:41.380]  I've been sitting on this for a long time.
[21:41.580 --> 21:42.600]  The character's name.
[21:42.880 --> 21:47.100]  The character's name is the Smashing Sportsman because we are a baseball.
[21:47.260 --> 21:48.140]  You're a baseball show.
[21:48.140 --> 21:51.280]  He's in two issues of the Justice League, 55, 56.
[21:51.680 --> 21:52.840]  He is so unknown.
[21:53.540 --> 21:56.400]  This is literally the only image of him I could find online.
[21:56.620 --> 21:58.040]  And there's not much fanfare.
[21:58.640 --> 22:00.400]  That is all you can acquire.
[22:00.880 --> 22:00.980]  Now, let me...
[22:00.980 --> 22:01.520]  What's his name?
[22:01.980 --> 22:02.640]  His name.
[22:02.780 --> 22:06.760]  Well, OK, so his villain name is the Smashing Sportsman.
[22:06.900 --> 22:09.580]  His character name is Marty Baxter.
[22:09.980 --> 22:14.580]  So let me just read the description of what the origin story of Marty Baxter is.
[22:14.580 --> 22:15.680]  And I took...
[22:15.680 --> 22:19.780]  I bought the issue of the comic because I had to just verify some of the things that they say.
[22:19.920 --> 22:22.000]  And I also have some photos of those to back it.
[22:22.520 --> 22:26.900]  Marty Baxter's world came crashing down when he learned that he had arthritis.
[22:27.600 --> 22:30.420]  We got a character with arthritis.
[22:30.820 --> 22:31.840]  That is his great struggle.
[22:32.380 --> 22:34.980]  The young baseball star now found it, in quotes,
[22:35.540 --> 22:40.820]  impossible to swing a bat and was absorbed in his problems as he sat in the stands
[22:40.820 --> 22:45.260]  watching the 1967 World Series that he'd otherwise been playing in.
[22:45.900 --> 22:50.800]  So this is a baseball player who cannot swing a bat anymore due to arthritis.
[22:51.600 --> 22:52.820]  I love this.
[22:52.960 --> 22:53.760]  Now, this is Geoff.
[22:53.900 --> 22:55.580]  This is now... this is where I'm worried about you.
[22:55.640 --> 22:58.400]  What I don't need to worry about is what happens is he's watching the game
[22:58.800 --> 23:03.740]  and then this fucking alien cube falls out of the sky and hits him in the back.
[23:04.480 --> 23:06.600]  OK, he's struck in the back by a black sphere.
[23:07.020 --> 23:09.400]  Baxter leaped to his feet with a stunning discovery.
[23:09.400 --> 23:11.800]  In quotes, my arthritis pain gone.
[23:12.260 --> 23:14.340]  I feel like a new man bursting with power.
[23:15.100 --> 23:18.420]  His euphoria lasted only a moment before his resentment set in.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.300]  The metal railing in front of Marty crumpled between his fingers as he lunged from the stands.
[23:23.880 --> 23:26.500]  I'll make the sports world pay for what they did to me.
[23:26.940 --> 23:29.020]  I'm going to smash down the stadium.
[23:29.660 --> 23:31.860]  To the astonished baseball players, he screamed,
[23:32.260 --> 23:33.760]  DOWN WITH ALL SPORTS!
[23:33.760 --> 23:38.180]  So his whole thing is he was a baseball player who got arthritis,
[23:38.520 --> 23:44.260]  couldn't play anymore because of it, gets hit by an alien cube in the back,
[23:44.800 --> 23:47.100]  and then he, uh, here we go.
[23:47.220 --> 23:52.080]  I'm going to send some screenshots of the comic that I took of some visuals.
[23:52.080 --> 23:52.840]  Do you have this comic?
[23:53.260 --> 23:56.240]  I bought it, yes, specifically to, like, confirm.
[23:56.360 --> 23:58.040]  That's him ripping the railing off.
[23:58.520 --> 23:59.560]  Oh, there's the black sphere.
[24:00.160 --> 24:03.580]  This is him screaming at very confused baseball players.
[24:03.760 --> 24:08.420]  Down with all sports, as he's ripping the railing off of the side of the thing.
[24:09.080 --> 24:11.520]  So his whole deal is he hates sport.
[24:11.660 --> 24:13.940]  The villain, he's not targeting people.
[24:14.500 --> 24:17.280]  His entire mission is he's going city by city,
[24:17.400 --> 24:20.040]  breaking stadiums so they can't play sports in them.
[24:20.340 --> 24:21.260]  That's his whole deal.
[24:21.660 --> 24:22.780]  That's how they track him down.
[24:22.860 --> 24:24.160]  They're like, where's the next stadium?
[24:24.320 --> 24:25.280]  Oh, it's two towns over?
[24:25.620 --> 24:27.180]  How much time passed between that thing,
[24:27.780 --> 24:29.700]  twatting him in the back and him ripping the railing off?
[24:29.980 --> 24:30.660]  Is it just immediate?
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.260]  Maybe six seconds.
[24:32.260 --> 24:33.660]  It is instant.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.700]  He immediately, he's ripping the thing.
[24:35.700 --> 24:37.920]  That's the laziest Arshid story I've ever heard.
[24:40.600 --> 24:44.200]  So, if that was a movie, the stadium would be coming down
[24:44.200 --> 24:46.160]  and, like, the opening credits would still be,
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.680]  like, the names of the people in the movie would still be on the screen.
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.340]  Did anybody ever claim ownership over the black sphere?
[24:52.860 --> 24:54.720]  No, uh, I don't know about that.
[24:54.800 --> 24:55.460]  I don't think so.
[24:55.520 --> 24:56.880]  I think these were, I don't think so.
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.880]  I think there were independent alien beings that represented themselves as spheres
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.420]  and then when they hit you, they powered you up, essentially, was the idea.
[25:05.060 --> 25:07.820]  So he gets, he gets hit in the back and they're like,
[25:07.880 --> 25:10.980]  oh, fuck, this guy is destroying stadiums left and right.
[25:11.140 --> 25:14.220]  They cannot play sports because of this guy.
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.020]  So, like, Robin and some other character figure out what stadium he's going to be at
[25:18.020 --> 25:19.660]  and they find him destroying the stadium.
[25:20.080 --> 25:23.400]  And then he, he, like, just destroys them.
[25:23.520 --> 25:24.720]  He, like, is super strong.
[25:24.820 --> 25:27.300]  He can blow wind, like, he's a ridiculous character.
[25:27.600 --> 25:30.740]  And he beats them up and is like, ah, maybe we ought to have a trade.
[25:30.740 --> 25:33.900]  And I should join the Justice League like they do in the big leagues.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.920]  Like, it's all weird, like sports metaphors.
[25:37.280 --> 25:39.800]  And so it's the whole thing is he breaks stadiums.
[25:39.980 --> 25:43.920]  Now, how they defeat him is maybe even arguably more bizarre.
[25:45.080 --> 25:49.920]  It turns out that the only weakness that these alien black spheres have
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.400]  is really shitty jokes, like really lame dad joke type jokes.
[25:55.660 --> 25:59.840]  And so they defeat the aliens by running to where they're hanging out.
[25:59.840 --> 26:00.760]  These guys.
[26:01.020 --> 26:04.040]  And they start cracking bad jokes at Marty Baxter.
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.440]  And he starts laughing and the laughter causes the alien sphere to float out of his body.
[26:09.660 --> 26:12.080]  And then they zap it with a taser and it's gone.
[26:14.380 --> 26:15.640]  That's how they defeat the alien.
[26:15.820 --> 26:19.960]  They also make a very clear point that they are not going to arrest Marty Baxter
[26:19.960 --> 26:22.000]  because he was possessed by the alien sphere.
[26:22.100 --> 26:26.340]  He is not liable for the stadiums that he destroyed in between those two events.
[26:26.340 --> 26:31.000]  So was he... he didn't... he wasn't like down with all sports once the ball left?
[26:31.540 --> 26:34.380]  No, as soon as the ball left, he's just like, ah, that was weird.
[26:34.620 --> 26:38.280]  Fucking broke like eight stadiums. Sorry about that.
[26:39.080 --> 26:41.560]  Don't arrest me. Don't put me in jail, please.
[26:42.020 --> 26:45.500]  That scene in Superman Returns where he stops the plane
[26:45.500 --> 26:52.900]  from like crashing into the baseball game and Marty Baxter is like, oh man, son of a bitch.
[26:52.900 --> 26:57.160]  I love the idea of Marty Baxter being at that game and getting hit by the sphere
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.540]  and starts breaking it anyway.
[27:00.040 --> 27:02.760]  Superman stops the jet, the stadium gets destroyed.
[27:03.260 --> 27:05.980]  So that is my 1A, the Smashing Sportsman.
[27:06.100 --> 27:08.120]  There's like no fanfare about him.
[27:08.340 --> 27:09.920]  I don't think anyone knows he exists.
[27:10.200 --> 27:13.080]  Like, as I said, that is the only image of that guy I could find.
[27:13.700 --> 27:18.240]  I think that's a fantastic selection, Andrew, and a great nomination.
[27:18.720 --> 27:20.100]  I think you did a wonderful job.
[27:21.080 --> 27:24.160]  That is truly, like, I don't even know how you found that one.
[27:24.260 --> 27:27.320]  That is a very minor, minor character.
[27:27.680 --> 27:28.900]  I have three as well.
[27:29.060 --> 27:29.600]  Do you? Are you?
[27:29.740 --> 27:30.740]  If you're ready, I can give you mine.
[27:31.220 --> 27:31.840]  I would love to hear them.
[27:31.840 --> 27:32.900]  I'm going to post them.
[27:33.520 --> 27:34.360]  I'm going to do the same thing you did.
[27:34.360 --> 27:35.300]  I'm just going to post them in the...
[27:36.420 --> 27:37.480]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[27:38.260 --> 27:38.960]  Here's my three.
[27:40.800 --> 27:42.580]  I did this bit with your carts.
[27:43.440 --> 27:46.100]  Yeah, now here's what, here's what I...
[27:46.100 --> 27:47.120]  No, no, here's what I'm doing.
[27:47.380 --> 27:49.680]  I looked at this as a fantastic opportunity
[27:49.680 --> 27:53.160]  to show the difference between our three cultures.
[27:53.280 --> 27:57.000]  I don't think we lean into enough the idea that you're a Canadian,
[27:57.160 --> 27:59.860]  and I'm an American, and Gavin is British, as far as we know.
[28:00.640 --> 28:02.640]  And no, we're all similar, and we're all friends.
[28:02.740 --> 28:04.440]  We all come from different places, different worlds.
[28:04.520 --> 28:05.560]  We've had different experiences.
[28:06.220 --> 28:06.940]  Different ages.
[28:07.440 --> 28:08.280]  Different ages.
[28:08.860 --> 28:10.580]  We're, you know, we're different cultures.
[28:10.940 --> 28:12.740]  So I thought this was a great opportunity
[28:12.740 --> 28:15.140]  to show the difference between our three cultures.
[28:15.140 --> 28:16.940]  Because as soon as we had the idea,
[28:16.940 --> 28:19.720]  I knew that you, as a Canadian,
[28:20.280 --> 28:22.740]  were going to say you would do the job,
[28:22.840 --> 28:25.640]  and then do the job, and be happy and excited about it.
[28:25.900 --> 28:28.640]  And I knew that as a British person, we assume,
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.780]  Gavin would take one look at it,
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.180]  decide, I'm not going to do about that,
[28:33.240 --> 28:35.700]  and then ignore it until the moment it's time to do it.
[28:35.760 --> 28:38.560]  And then when we do the podcast, he would go,
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.360]  What? Huh? I don't know.
[28:40.620 --> 28:43.340]  Which I'm assuming he will be filling in very soon with,
[28:43.380 --> 28:43.880]  which I can't wait.
[28:43.960 --> 28:46.460]  And then I, as an American, did the American thing,
[28:46.460 --> 28:48.280]  which is I copied off of your work,
[28:48.340 --> 28:49.740]  and then I'm taking credit for it.
[28:50.040 --> 28:51.840]  I'm okay with this. This is fine.
[28:51.940 --> 28:54.800]  And that's the difference between our three cultures.
[28:55.060 --> 28:57.220]  And it's not that I didn't want to do the work.
[28:57.320 --> 28:59.100]  It's that I just, I wanted to highlight that
[28:59.100 --> 29:00.620]  because I thought it was a great opportunity
[29:00.620 --> 29:03.480]  to show how similar but different we all are.
[29:03.580 --> 29:04.780]  Gavin, do you have your three ready?
[29:05.300 --> 29:06.380]  Yeah, just posted them.
[29:08.800 --> 29:10.620]  You know, I've been in America a long time.
[29:10.840 --> 29:12.220]  I'm basically an American now.
[29:15.280 --> 29:17.440]  So what's happened is Gavin has posted mine,
[29:17.640 --> 29:20.180]  which looks strikingly similar to Andrew's.
[29:22.600 --> 29:25.080]  I think the Smashing Sportsman is perfect.
[29:25.660 --> 29:28.340]  That's such a good one. That's the dumb, that's so stupid.
[29:28.840 --> 29:31.340]  I didn't realize, like, I knew there were some dumb superheroes,
[29:31.900 --> 29:35.480]  but that one is like, was that written on like a napkin?
[29:35.680 --> 29:41.100]  What was the long, was it just meant to be a very temporary character?
[29:41.100 --> 29:44.040]  Yeah, it was very, like, clearly, I mean, he's not even,
[29:44.220 --> 29:48.440]  it's like, technically, he's just a physical shell for the alien sphere.
[29:48.620 --> 29:52.520]  Like Marty Baxter is just a guy that has arthritis, is his character.
[29:53.560 --> 29:54.820]  Never seen again after that?
[29:55.260 --> 29:58.500]  No, he has two appearances and that's it. And it's brief.
[29:58.820 --> 29:59.980]  And like, there's no...
[29:59.980 --> 30:02.840]  Well, Eric posted a picture of him getting punched in the face.
[30:03.180 --> 30:04.340]  It's probably from the same comic.
[30:04.840 --> 30:07.100]  Oh, that's like the cover of the comic, I believe.
[30:07.120 --> 30:09.340]  Oh, and who's punching him?
[30:09.820 --> 30:10.700]  Is that Robin?
[30:11.100 --> 30:11.620]  I'm assuming.
[30:11.900 --> 30:12.800]  Robin dressed as Batman?
[30:13.400 --> 30:15.020]  Well, it's the big R on his chest.
[30:15.020 --> 30:15.460]  Bat-Robin.
[30:15.960 --> 30:16.780]  Bat-Robin.
[30:16.860 --> 30:16.980]  Yeah.
[30:17.480 --> 30:19.940]  Oh, no, it looks like Wonder Woman fell and hit her head, bonked her head.
[30:22.060 --> 30:29.520]  It seems to me like we need to begin a campaign now to convince DC to sell or give us
[30:30.180 --> 30:31.640]  the Smashing Sportsman.
[30:32.300 --> 30:32.960]  He seems perfect.
[30:33.320 --> 30:36.080]  He is perfect. And he was literally the first one I looked at.
[30:36.200 --> 30:38.940]  I was trying to pull it up and I accidentally came on that one.
[30:38.940 --> 30:43.520]  And then I spent the next, like, five or six hours reading every single one on the list.
[30:44.760 --> 30:45.680]  And none compared.
[30:45.860 --> 30:47.260]  When did he come up with his name?
[30:47.720 --> 30:48.840]  The Smashing Sportsman?
[30:49.480 --> 30:50.920]  Was it after the first stadium?
[30:51.560 --> 30:53.280]  Or was it like right after the rally?
[30:53.580 --> 30:55.540]  I think it's immediate.
[30:56.340 --> 30:58.700]  I don't know when. I don't think there's a time in which he...
[31:00.280 --> 31:04.820]  I wonder if it was even him coming up with the name or if it was the alien sphere coming up with
[31:04.820 --> 31:05.120]  the name.
[31:05.540 --> 31:06.660]  It's another great question.
[31:07.340 --> 31:09.420]  Where did he begin and the sphere end?
[31:10.060 --> 31:12.020]  Man, I'm fucking jazzed.
[31:12.080 --> 31:18.260]  I think that f***face could do a lot worse than being officially protected by the Smashing
[31:18.260 --> 31:18.700]  Sportsman.
[31:18.800 --> 31:20.440]  He seems like the perfect...
[31:20.980 --> 31:22.760]  He seems like the perfect brand defender.
[31:23.300 --> 31:27.480]  That's what makes me worried about it with you, Geoff, is he's a character with arthritis who
[31:27.480 --> 31:29.560]  can no longer swing a bat because of it.
[31:30.020 --> 31:31.140]  You have the arthritis.
[31:31.140 --> 31:33.000]  You're going to attempt to swing a bat.
[31:33.000 --> 31:37.300]  I'm very nervous that we are one alien sphere away from you becoming the Smashing Sportsman.
[31:37.360 --> 31:38.880]  We'll put a net over the top of him.
[31:40.080 --> 31:45.260]  I go out every day and pray to get hit in the back with a black alien sphere and it
[31:45.260 --> 31:45.800]  doesn't happen.
[31:46.060 --> 31:49.320]  So if one day my prayers are answered, look out world.
[31:51.220 --> 31:53.420]  It's just such a weird thing to turn against.
[31:53.940 --> 31:58.500]  It'd be like if Peter Parker got bit by the spider and then he just decided to kill all
[31:58.500 --> 32:00.640]  bus drivers because the bus drove off with him.
[32:03.120 --> 32:04.680]  Because it's the first thing he saw.
[32:07.380 --> 32:10.040]  As a baseball podcast, I think it fits perfectly with us.
[32:10.260 --> 32:13.760]  Well, I would love to hear what the comment leavers have to think about it.
[32:14.020 --> 32:14.380]  Absolutely.
[32:14.840 --> 32:16.420]  I don't think we're a baseball podcast anymore.
[32:16.500 --> 32:17.540]  I think we're a fruit podcast.
[32:18.060 --> 32:19.300]  That I'm OK with that.
[32:19.480 --> 32:20.340]  As long as it's apple.
[32:21.480 --> 32:22.760]  Not bullshit like banana.
[32:23.100 --> 32:24.480]  Apple, the fruit, not the product.
[32:24.600 --> 32:25.680]  Once again, important clarification.
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.520]  Yeah, sorry, I was not paying attention.
[32:28.280 --> 32:34.000]  Oh, man, that was fucking great.
[32:38.710 --> 32:40.210]  What is HelloFresh?
[32:40.410 --> 32:42.130]  Oh my God, I got that answer.
[32:42.450 --> 32:47.510]  It's a it's an awesome pre-proportioned ingredients and seasonal recipes, but they're delivered.
[32:47.830 --> 32:51.250]  They're not at a restaurant or at a store, although at some point maybe they are in their
[32:51.250 --> 32:51.690]  life cycle.
[32:51.770 --> 32:52.250]  I don't know.
[32:52.430 --> 32:55.650]  I don't know where they originate, but the problem thing is when they end up in your
[32:55.650 --> 32:59.910]  house delivered right to your doorstep and you can skip trips to the grocery store.
[32:59.910 --> 33:05.010]  You can count on HelloFresh to make home cooking easy, fun and affordable.

[33:17.910 --> 33:25.290]  But HelloFresh keeps things simple and clean with recipes and ingredients that cut out
[33:25.290 --> 33:31.070]  grocery shopping and limit meal prep time so you can spend more of the festive season

[33:49.430 --> 33:52.290]  You guessed it, festive and gourmet options.
[33:52.390 --> 33:54.730]  I have no idea whether they are festive or not.
[33:55.290 --> 33:57.430]  They provide plenty of variety, though, I'll tell you that.
[33:57.570 --> 34:03.050]  Also, these ingredients travel from the farm to your door within a week and with a smile on.
[34:03.130 --> 34:06.370]  They're happy when they get there because they know they're going to be eaten quickly
[34:07.110 --> 34:12.890]  and put to good use, making people happy and providing nutrients to their bodies.
[34:13.250 --> 34:16.790]  And you get all this convenience without skimping on the quality.
[34:17.150 --> 34:18.050]  We talked about it.
[34:18.110 --> 34:20.730]  They're fantastic and they're festive.

[35:10.770 --> 35:19.070]  I know from experience, I have had quite a few, uh, toilet centric, uh, difficulties in my life.
[35:19.070 --> 35:25.990]  You've heard me talk about them, uh, in and out of, uh, podcasts and other content, uh, as I go in
[35:25.990 --> 35:32.170]  and out of the bathroom. Uh, it's been a myriad of issues my entire life until, until I discovered
[35:32.170 --> 35:38.650]  the Hello Tushy, uh, and, uh, treated myself to a clean, but clean enough to sit on a couch naked
[35:38.650 --> 35:44.170]  if I chose to do so. I would not. I am not a nudist. I'm fairly modest. Uh, typically don't
[35:44.170 --> 35:49.550]  sit anywhere naked. I even wear, uh, sometimes full clothes to bed, but, uh, I'm not like a never nude. I
[35:49.550 --> 35:56.810]  do shower naked, but, uh, but I'm not crazy about being naked. However, my butt is so clean that
[35:56.810 --> 36:01.050]  if I wanted to, I could, I could sit anywhere. I could sit anywhere in the house I wanted to with my
[36:01.050 --> 36:04.890]  butthole and it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't know. Nobody would, nobody would know. It'd be, it's just
[36:04.890 --> 36:10.210]  clean and fresh. That's all you got to worry about here. Hello Tushy is the modern bidet for people

[37:20.390 --> 37:23.990]  So what did you want to touch on, Geoff? You had, you had a huge list, apparently. Oh,
[37:24.190 --> 37:30.070]  yeah, so, well, the uniform innovation. Yeah, we're down, we're down to just that, I think,
[37:30.190 --> 37:35.570]  actually. Perfect. And, uh, so when I was in Florida last week, uh, as always, my, my body
[37:35.570 --> 37:39.950]  was in Florida on the other podcast, but my mind and my heart and my brain were back here,
[37:40.390 --> 37:45.510]  uh, with you guys, uh, trying to come up with ideas for F*** Face. And, uh, in that process,
[37:45.510 --> 37:50.350]  I actually had a really good conversation with minor league fan Jack and then producer Ben,
[37:50.990 --> 37:54.610]  uh, who's honestly in a league of his own. Uh, he really, we should just call him league of his own
[37:54.610 --> 38:00.110]  Ben. Uh, he's, he's very, he's, he's really great. Uh, it really stands out next to minor league fan
[38:00.110 --> 38:04.050]  Jack, let me tell you, after spending four days with those two. Uh, anyway, and in that process,
[38:04.050 --> 38:09.250]  they were actually super, super helpful. They, they, uh, I don't know where their ideas begin
[38:09.250 --> 38:12.470]  and end and my, you know, it was just like a long conversation, but I want to, I want to give them
[38:12.470 --> 38:17.690]  huge props, uh, because they were instrumental, uh, in the evolution of this idea. I feel like
[38:17.690 --> 38:22.470]  you're going against literally what you said America does. As the American move, you should
[38:22.470 --> 38:26.870]  have just solely taken credit for it. This is your genius. Yeah, I'm not, maybe I'm not the
[38:26.870 --> 38:32.670]  best American. I'm trying, you know, that was a great opportunity to illustrate the, the difference
[38:32.670 --> 38:39.190]  between our cultures, but I, I, on a personal level, I strive to, to, to be better. Uh, so anyway,
[38:39.570 --> 38:46.030]  uh, the world was turned on its head the day that Beef Bracelet came out. I think we all can agree
[38:46.030 --> 38:53.310]  with that. I think that nobody saw it coming. Uh, it smacked us all, flipped our brains around,
[38:53.630 --> 38:58.350]  changed the way we think about things, made everybody's life better. And then, uh, we thought
[38:58.350 --> 39:02.670]  we were good, but we didn't rest there. We immediately, not immediately, but with the, uh,
[39:02.670 --> 39:09.070]  the appropriate amount of R&D time, uh, we hit them with our sophomore release, Too Spicy Icy, right?
[39:09.390 --> 39:14.270]  Nobody saw it coming. Totally different lane, a lot of symmetry between the products. Totally
[39:14.270 --> 39:19.750]  makes sense. Uniform, uh, which by the way, uniform, uh, providing, uh, or, uh, combining the power of
[39:19.750 --> 39:24.790]  one with the fabric of the farm uniform, uh, can easily produce both products. Uh, it makes total
[39:24.790 --> 39:28.570]  sense. Uh, so I've been thinking since then, because it's like, I'll be honest with you.
[39:28.610 --> 39:31.170]  People are chomping at the bit. They're, they're like knocking on my door. Like,
[39:31.210 --> 39:35.230]  Geoff, we want, what's the next Too Spicy Icy? We want the next thing. I had somebody in Florida,
[39:35.630 --> 39:40.310]  uh, at a, at like a community meetup, uh, offered to help fund the Too Spicy Icy. And I'm like,
[39:40.350 --> 39:44.270]  I appreciate that, sir. But that project is well on its way. Let's, let's look to the future and
[39:44.270 --> 39:49.030]  what the next thing is. And in this process, I found that I felt a profound responsibility
[39:49.570 --> 39:55.470]  to create the next great thing. And that's not a good place to be when you want to create,
[39:55.890 --> 39:59.230]  right? Desperation isn't the best place to be when you're trying to invent. You don't want that
[39:59.230 --> 40:03.310]  pressure. Sometimes, some people thrive on, under it, but I, I find it's best just to kind of let
[40:03.310 --> 40:07.850]  it work itself out. I was having that conversation with, with Jack and Ben, you know, talking about
[40:07.850 --> 40:12.530]  how frustrating it is and how, uh, I, I just feel this unrelenting pressure and I, I didn't think
[40:12.530 --> 40:18.330]  I'd be able to come up with anything for a while. Then I read an article that changed my life.
[40:18.330 --> 40:22.970]  Did you guys know this? And by the way, this is going to be phase one. I'll go ahead and say this
[40:22.970 --> 40:29.090]  right now. This is phase, this is phase one of this project. Okay. Did you guys know that until
[40:31.010 --> 40:37.950]  19, well, I don't know the year, until about 1914, until about 1914 in World War I, people
[40:37.950 --> 40:42.950]  didn't wear wristwatches. Yeah. Are you familiar with that? Yeah. People had pocket watches.
[40:44.150 --> 40:49.530]  Wristwatches were considered garish. Uh, they were also considered feminine. Uh, some people that did
[40:49.530 --> 40:53.850]  wear them were women. So it was considered like not manly to wear one. And this was, uh, this was
[40:53.850 --> 40:58.090]  in, you know, the, these were very, uh, different times back then. Right. Uh, and that kind of thing
[40:58.090 --> 41:03.150]  mattered to people more, I guess. And it wasn't until World War I that when soldiers realized
[41:03.150 --> 41:05.770]  they didn't have time to be fishing around in their pockets for their pocket watch to see what
[41:05.770 --> 41:12.310]  time it was, they started wearing wristwatches and it changed the world. All because, all because
[41:12.310 --> 41:15.610]  some soldier didn't want to put his hand in his pocket because it would have to, he would have to
[41:15.610 --> 41:21.590]  take it off the trigger. That one moment, even though, even though, this is 1914 to 1918, right?
[41:21.830 --> 41:29.290]  Even though fucking, uh, Patek Philippe in 1868, a Swiss watch manufacturer, Swiss watch manufacturer
[41:29.910 --> 41:36.710]  invented the first rich wristwatch for Countess Koskowitz of Hungary, right? So in 1868, the
[41:36.710 --> 41:41.510]  wristwatch is invented and brought out to the world, introduced to the world. And it's not until
[41:42.230 --> 41:48.630]  60 years later that it rises in popularity. Fast forward to 2021. Do you guys realize that the
[41:48.630 --> 41:58.810]  global luxury watch market is estimated at $7.18 billion and that by 2025, it's expected to reach
[41:58.810 --> 42:07.190]  $9.28 billion? Think about that. That is $9 billion of wealth that will be generated in one year,
[42:07.190 --> 42:15.030]  75 years after the, or 100 years after the first dude decided, I, I should put this stupid watch
[42:15.030 --> 42:18.670]  on my wrist so I don't have to keep fishing around in my pocket. So you're saying that's insane.
[42:19.150 --> 42:22.610]  There's a clear, there's a future for this. Like it's going to continue. What I'm saying,
[42:23.190 --> 42:31.070]  what I'm saying is there is a tremendous opportunity for us to look at what's in our
[42:31.070 --> 42:37.750]  pockets and put it on our wrist. Think about it. What have people, I've been doing research.
[42:38.130 --> 42:40.990]  I've been doing tons of, believe it or not, there's a ton of research on what people carry
[42:40.990 --> 42:45.370]  in their pockets. Here's a few of the most common things. Wallets, pins, keys, candy,
[42:45.670 --> 42:52.930]  snacks. We've covered that of course. Loose change, dollars, phone, comb, mints and gum,
[42:53.050 --> 42:58.830]  headphones, lighter, chapstick, lipstick, makeup, knives, flashlights. All we got to do
[42:58.830 --> 43:04.330]  is put any one of those things on our fucking wrist and then popularize it and we will make
[43:04.330 --> 43:11.610]  nine billion dollars in 2025. It's no sillier than what they did in World War I. Why not a wrist
[43:11.610 --> 43:16.890]  comb? Why not wrist keys? Why not like key gloves? Why not like Wolver keys? You hit a button and
[43:16.890 --> 43:21.610]  they extract out of your fingers. I don't know. But what about Edward Locksmith hands, right?
[43:21.710 --> 43:26.570]  There's all kinds of stuff we could do. I'm a big fan of the Swiss Army wrist. I think it should
[43:26.570 --> 43:31.450]  be a first product as like 20 different things. And my girlfriend brought up to me. She was like,
[43:31.470 --> 43:35.690]  the wrist wallets already exist. Wristlets exist. That kind of stuff exists. And I'm like, yeah,
[43:35.790 --> 43:41.630]  but the fucking wristwatch existed for 65 years before somebody realized, oh, this thing is
[43:41.630 --> 43:46.610]  awesome as dicks. Let's fucking use it. And now it's making billions of dollars a year.
[43:46.870 --> 43:53.270]  Wrist keys exist. You go swimming. Wrist keys. But we need to popularize them. It's not about
[43:53.270 --> 43:57.850]  that. It's okay that they already exist because they're not popular yet. I've seen the wrist
[43:57.850 --> 44:03.070]  phone cases exist to like little pit boys people could put, but it takes the right group of people
[44:03.070 --> 44:09.210]  to look at it, see the need, see the potential, and then then fucking pounce on that potential
[44:09.210 --> 44:15.010]  and boom, hit a thousand baseballs to the moon of success. And that's what I think we should do.
[44:15.210 --> 44:23.030]  Okay. So phase one is we find stuff that we can take from our pockets and put it on a wrist. I
[44:23.030 --> 44:28.410]  don't want you guys to see it. They are, these already exist. Slap wrist, like slap bands that
[44:28.410 --> 44:33.410]  are also pins. Perfect. They exist. You didn't know that. I didn't know that because they're
[44:33.410 --> 44:38.390]  not popular yet, but we can make our own. Yeah. Like, you know, writing pin, a writing pin,
[44:38.570 --> 44:44.070]  slap and writing pin. You don't need to carry a pin around anymore. Slap band on your wrist.
[44:44.310 --> 44:49.950]  P E N pins. It's just one idea. People from the South say it the same.
[44:49.950 --> 44:57.190]  Pin, pin. I am from the South, so maybe I do. Anyway, so like wrist pins, right? That's one
[44:57.190 --> 45:03.410]  thing we could do tomorrow. So what I'm presenting to you guys isn't necessarily a product. It's an
[45:03.410 --> 45:09.710]  idea for a suite of products. If anything, it's an idea for a revolution. I mean, am I writing
[45:09.710 --> 45:14.150]  with my wrist or am I just pulling a pen out of it? You pull it off and then you can write with
[45:14.150 --> 45:18.810]  it and then you slap it back down. Or who knows? Because we can invent things too. I'm just saying
[45:18.810 --> 45:22.490]  that exists. We can buy it. We can put our logo on it. We can change it around. We can improve
[45:22.490 --> 45:26.950]  upon it, right? They had to improve upon the wristwatch, by the way. It used to have to have
[45:26.950 --> 45:30.070]  in those days, it used to have to have a guard around the top of it because they had to protect
[45:30.670 --> 45:34.630]  the crystal and they were scared that it would break and glass was very hard to come by. So they
[45:34.630 --> 45:38.110]  had these like metal things that covered and then they just had holes where you could see the hours.
[45:39.170 --> 45:44.670]  And then we improved upon that. Now you have a fully faced glass wristwatch. We can improve
[45:44.670 --> 45:49.950]  upon these things that already exist as we popularize them and help usher wrist entertainment,
[45:50.330 --> 45:56.170]  wrist convenience into the 21st century. We need to drag it into the 21st century like they drug
[45:56.170 --> 46:01.050]  watches into the 20th century. I would have never guessed that the handshake came out after the
[46:01.050 --> 46:07.890]  wristwatch. That's one of my takeaways from this. I think I like where your head is at. Do we have
[46:07.890 --> 46:13.110]  to like rank what is most important to us as far? No, I think we just I think we just think about
[46:13.110 --> 46:18.150]  what would do well. And like I said, I'm not presenting you necessarily a the pen, the slap
[46:18.150 --> 46:23.730]  and pen is an idea that I had. And I looked and it exists and we can work on that. But I would
[46:23.730 --> 46:29.270]  more just present to you the idea that start thinking in this direction. What how could face
[46:30.070 --> 46:34.570]  revolutionize people's wrists? We already did it once with wrist with beef bracelet. Obviously,
[46:34.570 --> 46:38.550]  everybody knows that. But with the help of uniform, uniform combining the power of one
[46:38.550 --> 46:42.590]  with the fabric of the farm uniform, we can there's almost nothing we can't do.
[46:43.110 --> 46:46.750]  You know what I mean? Do we still need to have a wrist bracelet if we're doing this?
[46:46.970 --> 46:51.010]  We could. We could do whatever you want. Okay, I'm just curious if this is replacing if this
[46:51.010 --> 46:55.010]  is like an innovation on the beef bracelet or if it could we could we could we could further
[46:55.010 --> 46:59.170]  innovate the beef bracelet. We could make it a part of this. It could maintain its own thing,
[46:59.950 --> 47:04.670]  maintain its own identity. I'm open to all possibilities because I'm just I'm seeing
[47:04.670 --> 47:11.490]  I'm just seeing untapped potential. And I don't think anyone is better positioned
[47:11.490 --> 47:19.250]  than face to jump to pounce on that potential. And we will all be billionaires this time by 2025
[47:19.250 --> 47:24.730]  if we do it properly. And then after we spend a couple maybe I don't know how long how much time
[47:24.730 --> 47:30.690]  it's going to take for us to go through phase one. But then then my friends, then we enter into phase
[47:30.690 --> 47:35.690]  two. Are you ready for phase two? Are you excited about phase two? Do you think you can handle
[47:35.690 --> 47:40.490]  phase two? I'm ready for it. I hope I can. Okay, what have we what have we been doing? What have
[47:40.490 --> 47:44.370]  been doing all through phase one? Which is a useful phase. It's going to be a financially
[47:44.370 --> 47:48.250]  beneficial phase for us. It's going to we're all going to be very happy that we went through it.
[47:48.750 --> 47:52.470]  What are we going to do when we get to phase two? I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going
[47:52.470 --> 47:57.970]  to eliminate damn near everything we did in phase one because we're going to eliminate the very
[47:57.970 --> 48:04.750]  pocket itself. We don't need it. It's bullshit. I've been I've lived with women most of my life.
[48:04.950 --> 48:09.030]  They hate their pockets because they're tiny and useless and oftentimes sewed together. It's not
[48:09.030 --> 48:14.450]  fair that men have big pockets and women have small pockets. And also the fucking I will I will
[48:14.450 --> 48:18.530]  go so far as to say I've been thinking about this a lot. The back pocket is a goddamn atrocity. We
[48:18.530 --> 48:23.570]  need to get rid of it because that thing is a menace. Think about this, men, what do you put
[48:23.570 --> 48:27.730]  in your back pocket? You put your wallet in your back pocket. What's in your wallet? Everything
[48:28.270 --> 48:33.610]  you own that you can't possibly leave home without. And where do you put it? On the one
[48:33.610 --> 48:38.490]  spot of your body that you don't have eyes on? You got no coverage on? You can't see back there?
[48:38.490 --> 48:42.250]  That's the dumbest thing ever. It's like here's everything that's important and valuable to me.
[48:42.490 --> 48:47.450]  I'm going to stick it on my ass and show everybody but me. I hate it. We need to get rid of pockets.
[48:47.590 --> 48:53.210]  And by doing that, what we will do is we will migrate the very pocket to the wrist. Think of
[48:53.210 --> 48:58.390]  a big floppy pocket just hanging from your wrist. Throw your keys in there. You can see your keys.
[48:58.690 --> 49:02.250]  Throw your wallet in there. You got eyes on it at all times. It's in front of you. It's a lot
[49:02.250 --> 49:06.910]  harder to pick a hand than it is to pick a butt. You've invented the purse without a strap.
[49:06.910 --> 49:11.970]  I have invented the wrist pocket. The purse exists. The wristlet exists. All of these things
[49:11.970 --> 49:18.550]  exist. Don't... eliminate the word invent from your brain right now. We're not talking about
[49:18.550 --> 49:27.410]  inventing. We're talking about revolutionizing. We're talking about popularizing. We're talking
[49:27.410 --> 49:32.070]  about... we're talking about taking things that may exist already but making them better and
[49:32.070 --> 49:37.090]  more prevalent so that the larger world sees them through the eyes, through the lens,
[49:37.210 --> 49:43.930]  with the possibility that we do so that we then incent them to want these products to improve
[49:43.930 --> 49:48.330]  their lives. And then, it's not a product at that point. It's a whole goddamn movement. We're
[49:48.330 --> 49:53.790]  changing the world. We're going to get rid of pockets in phase two. Phase one, we're going to
[49:53.790 --> 49:58.910]  improve wrists. Phase two, we're getting rid of pockets. And phase three, we're all buying boats
[49:58.910 --> 50:04.490]  and fucking high-fiving off super yachts. I love it. I'm a big fan of this. I will have... I kind
[50:04.490 --> 50:07.370]  of have an idea in my mind already. I think I'll have a prototype next time we record.
[50:07.670 --> 50:11.610]  I'm imagining... I already have an idea. I love it. Like a horse feedback for my hat.
[50:13.350 --> 50:18.770]  Yeah, maybe. If that's what it could look like, yeah. I am all about the convenience and hands-free
[50:18.770 --> 50:24.310]  of things. Like, it's a big... one of my great struggles... maybe we... the uniform could maybe
[50:24.310 --> 50:31.830]  branch onto this. I really wish that goggles were a popularized form of glasses. I cannot stand...
[50:31.830 --> 50:36.370]  I should have... I have the worst long-distance vision. I have glasses. Never wear them. Don't
[50:36.370 --> 50:40.950]  like the feel of it on my nose. They're always sliding down. Always uncomfortable. I wish I could
[50:40.950 --> 50:45.730]  live in a world where I could just strap some goggles on and I'm good to go. If goggles were
[50:45.730 --> 50:52.130]  popular, my vision would be substantially better. A day-to-day life. Your nose indestructible but
[50:52.130 --> 50:56.570]  can't hold up a pair of glasses. It cannot. It's too... I'm telling you, it's too slippery. It bobs
[50:56.570 --> 51:02.050]  and weaves. It... not even glasses can stand on it. Just put some grip on the glasses. Like grip tape.
[51:02.470 --> 51:07.130]  Oh yeah, then he looks like a 1950s shop teacher. No, I get it. At that point, I'm just putting on goggles.
[51:07.530 --> 51:11.670]  Like, what are you... Also, you know what? You know what, Andrew? It's 2021. We are living in the
[51:11.670 --> 51:16.270]  fucking future. What's more futuristic than goggles? I'm not even talking, like, cool futuristic...
[51:16.270 --> 51:21.010]  like, whenever you see a basketball player with goggles, like, I'm always like, I wish that was a
[51:21.010 --> 51:26.210]  look that was just acceptable. I wish that was a popularized form of it. Or even, like, the pool. Like,
[51:26.270 --> 51:30.790]  when you put pool goggles on, I wish those for glasses existed. I wish that was just a thing.
[51:31.230 --> 51:36.190]  I don't... they're always sliding, so I don't wear them. Yeah, but you can't have bad peripheral vision with...
[51:36.190 --> 51:41.990]  there's a reason it's just right in front on glasses. I will... I will take a hit on my peripheral
[51:41.990 --> 51:46.870]  vision in exchange for them not sliding and not having to ever think about them. They're just
[51:46.870 --> 51:54.550]  locked in. But also, once again, goggles exist, but goggles with perfect peripheral vision might not
[51:54.550 --> 51:58.950]  exist, but they could. Maybe that's been holding everyone back. And maybe if we can solve that
[51:58.950 --> 52:03.650]  problem, then not only can Andrew enjoy these goggles, but everybody can. Maybe every kid in
[52:03.650 --> 52:08.930]  high school will be wearing face goggles this time 2025. I don't know, but I love it. I love the way
[52:08.930 --> 52:14.090]  it's going. And from what I can tell from the from Eric's comments in the Discord, he's on board as
[52:14.090 --> 52:21.650]  well. I think the most useful place for a magnetic implant would be around the eyes, so you could
[52:21.650 --> 52:27.230]  just magnet glasses onto the front of your face. I love that idea. I like the idea. I don't want
[52:27.230 --> 52:32.250]  them to put anything near my eyes. I don't want any, like, it's just... it's scary. It's a scary
[52:32.250 --> 52:37.010]  place. Just under the eyebrows. Nah, no, I don't want any machinery going in there. I don't want...
[52:37.010 --> 52:40.570]  I don't trust... No machinery, just like a thin magnet. Yeah, but they're gonna have to do a
[52:40.570 --> 52:57.490]  surgical procedure. What was that? I ran out of liquid. I'm good. I'm good. He got scared of the magnets.
[53:00.410 --> 53:04.250]  I was talking and my mouth just suddenly went very dry. I'm good.
[53:05.730 --> 53:09.810]  So there you go, guys. I don't have a new product for us, but I have a vision
[53:10.210 --> 53:13.790]  of where we can... I feel like you just said, like, seven different products. I think we have
[53:13.790 --> 53:17.550]  plenty of products for us. Yeah, but I mean, I don't have, like, I don't... I gave jumping off
[53:17.550 --> 53:22.050]  points, right? But I don't have materials prepared for you guys. I don't have logos and commercials
[53:22.050 --> 53:26.210]  and... not like I usually come, you know, like with a product ready for you to buy. Sure. I just have
[53:26.210 --> 53:31.550]  more of an idea of where we could take this. I feel like the last place I want more clutter
[53:31.550 --> 53:35.950]  is around my hands area. Yeah, that's what people said before World War I.
[53:39.110 --> 53:43.510]  I'm excited. I have a prototype in mind. I don't know if you have any ideas, Gavin,
[53:43.590 --> 53:46.750]  but I immediately just have a thought. I could certainly come up with something
[53:46.750 --> 53:53.150]  for the next episode. I would love to have my phone permanently on the side of my wrist,
[53:53.310 --> 53:58.610]  kind of like where quarterbacks put their plays, you know, like pop it up and they look at their
[53:58.610 --> 54:03.050]  plays where they shut the thing. I would love to have my phone there and I could just like...
[54:03.050 --> 54:08.250]  It would be so cool. Yeah, I like where your head is at. Honestly,
[54:08.370 --> 54:12.330]  this is more grounded than I was anticipating. I could see a world where this exists.
[54:13.090 --> 54:17.510]  I spend a lot of time in a hotel room on my back with nothing to do but browse the internet for
[54:17.510 --> 54:24.490]  fake products. I think it'll be interesting to see what we value for our pockets.
[54:25.450 --> 54:29.730]  What things do we want brought to the front? I guess it's all of it, right? Is what you're
[54:29.730 --> 54:33.750]  saying? Because phase two is the destruction of pockets. So really, we can't have anything in
[54:33.750 --> 54:40.230]  there. Well, not to destroy them, but to render them useless to the degree that... You can use
[54:40.230 --> 54:43.790]  that pocket if you need to, but everybody else is going to be using wrist pockets at this point. So
[54:43.790 --> 54:48.090]  you won't be in Vogue anymore, you know. Wrist pockets.
[54:48.690 --> 54:54.190]  Have you ever been outside sweating in the heat and you have to then go somewhere that requires
[54:54.190 --> 54:59.710]  a mask and you realize your mask has been in your back pocket and you've been sat sweating on it for
[54:59.710 --> 55:06.030]  the last two hours? No, because I usually hang my mask around my wrist. Oh, so you're already
[55:06.630 --> 55:10.450]  putting your wrist to... I already wrist my mask. And I didn't even think about it till you said
[55:10.450 --> 55:16.070]  that, but that's exactly how I... I'm already doing this in practice. Holy shit. Are you really
[55:16.070 --> 55:21.570]  wristing your masks already? I always wrist my mask. I've been doing it since day one. I can't.
[55:21.710 --> 55:27.490]  Okay, you're... Geoff is a wrist guy, is what I've learned. Yeah, I hate the feeling of that. I can't
[55:27.490 --> 55:34.310]  get shit off my arms. Yeah? I don't know, man. I started wearing watches and it really... it's
[55:34.310 --> 55:38.230]  really... and then it's really opened up my love of wrist stuff. And I think that there's a lot of...
[55:38.230 --> 55:42.850]  I think a lot of people feel the same. Well, I feel like... let's just explore because I agree
[55:42.850 --> 55:47.230]  with you. I have no issue with the wrist. Where would you like it to be, Gavin? Like, what is...
[55:47.230 --> 55:51.750]  is there a different part of the body that would be more ideal than the wrist? To hold a mask?
[55:52.070 --> 55:56.410]  To hold whatever. It just seemed like you didn't like things around your wrist, generally speaking,
[55:56.410 --> 56:01.710]  is how I interpreted that comment. Where would... where would the ideal place be if not the wrist?
[56:01.910 --> 56:07.410]  Maybe my back. You just... are we just making a backpack at this point? Like, what type of...
[56:07.410 --> 56:12.810]  Imagine... imagine a backpack except it's in the shirt. It's like a big... a big old pocket,
[56:13.350 --> 56:18.190]  a big pocket on the back of a t-shirt that I could just, like, stick an iPad in or something.
[56:18.710 --> 56:22.750]  Yeah, I like this. I feel like that's very specific because what you're gonna sit down,
[56:22.830 --> 56:25.590]  you're gonna... it's gonna stab you immediately, whatever you got back there.
[56:26.030 --> 56:30.430]  It'd be kind of like how Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow have their swords crossed on the back,
[56:30.830 --> 56:35.650]  but instead it's like a laptop and an iPad. Or like a pocket that could fit a water bottle in
[56:35.650 --> 56:39.230]  it or something. Just something where it's like, I don't want to... I don't want to take the bag
[56:39.230 --> 56:43.850]  with me, but if I just have my water bottle and I just sort of slot it into my back like a sword,
[56:44.250 --> 56:47.550]  like I'm sheathing a sword behind my back, and I pull it out when I get to work.
[56:48.110 --> 56:53.770]  Class. I mean, I think... I think this is... this is exactly where we need to be,
[56:53.770 --> 56:58.030]  thinking like this. Like, take a step back and think of it this way. Why are pockets where they
[56:58.030 --> 57:02.190]  are? Because the first person who put a pocket put it there, and then we all went, oh, okay,
[57:02.230 --> 57:05.870]  I guess that's where pockets go. And then you put a pocket there because the last guy put a pocket
[57:05.870 --> 57:09.150]  there, and the person before that put a pocket there. And so for hundreds of years, we've all
[57:09.150 --> 57:13.230]  had pockets where they are because we're just... we're just fucking sheep. We're just sheeping our
[57:13.230 --> 57:17.570]  way through pocket town, right? No, I feel like people have adventured with the pocket. There's
[57:17.970 --> 57:22.470]  sleeve pockets, there's chest pockets. I feel like people don't use them. Nah, people don't use them
[57:22.470 --> 57:28.990]  because they haven't cracked the code yet. People didn't use wristwatches till the need and the
[57:28.990 --> 57:33.870]  benefit was shown to them. And then they became a symbol of masculinity, they became a symbol of
[57:33.870 --> 57:37.650]  patriotism, and then everybody wanted to wear them. That's all we need to do. We need to find
[57:37.650 --> 57:43.930]  our World War I pocket watch. That's all we gotta do. I really like the idea of more pockets. I
[57:43.930 --> 57:48.370]  know we're supposed to get rid of them, but if somebody had like a clown's car worth of items
[57:48.370 --> 57:53.470]  and hidden pockets, that's just a great... that's hilarious. I guess I don't want to eliminate the
[57:53.470 --> 58:01.470]  pocket, I just want to eliminate its intransigence in where it lives. I want to liberate the pocket.
[58:01.770 --> 58:07.870]  You know what I mean? I see. I want the pocket to move for you. I don't want you to put your shit
[58:07.870 --> 58:14.170]  in a pocket that is put there because of hundreds of years of people following in line and not
[58:14.170 --> 58:18.830]  thinking outside the box, not looking up, just looking at their feet and shuffling forward through
[58:18.830 --> 58:24.350]  fashion, not even daring to look left or right and innovate. I want us to innovate. I want the
[58:24.350 --> 58:28.250]  pocket to go where you want the pocket to go. It's like I said a long time ago, you're talking
[58:28.250 --> 58:32.430]  about the mindset of like always punting on fourth down. People do it because that's what
[58:32.430 --> 58:37.070]  people do, not because it necessarily makes sense. Yeah, exactly. Not because it makes sense.
[58:37.070 --> 58:41.110]  Yeah, we need a culture change of not always going for the pocket.
[58:41.470 --> 58:48.670]  Yeah, and that's where bold people make bold decisions and find bold successes.
[58:49.210 --> 58:53.410]  Is the product called bold? Like I said, I felt very specific. I don't know. I'm just saying like
[58:53.410 --> 58:57.650]  what I'm just no, I don't know. I'm just saying like that's how I think this is. This could be a
[58:57.650 --> 59:03.690]  huge untapped potential future for F*** Face, a division of Fleek Face, a division of
[59:03.690 --> 59:08.090]  uniform, uniform, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm uniform.
[59:08.390 --> 59:13.410]  You know what I'm saying? So I just I think we would be remiss. I think we'd be it'd be
[59:13.410 --> 59:19.330]  a tremendous wasted opportunity also to cement F*** Face in the social,
[59:19.970 --> 59:24.650]  the permanent social fabric of the world. Well, we're already going to reinvent the high five,
[59:24.790 --> 59:29.090]  right? What better way to follow it up than to reinvent the pocket and the wrist? It's
[59:29.090 --> 59:35.010]  the very wrist itself. I like it. I'm going to have a prototype or at least I'll try to
[59:35.010 --> 59:39.030]  next time we record. I have an idea. I have one, too, but we might not get to it because
[59:39.030 --> 59:44.890]  of all the chocolate Andrew's going to eat. Oh, no, it's going to be easy. I'm going to
[59:44.890 --> 59:50.650]  be on my victory lap. Well, I guess. F*** when is what day is next? Wednesday, 27th.
[59:51.030 --> 59:56.690]  Or no, I guess Thursday. We'll record next week. We'll record Thursday. Yeah. So that'll be one day
[59:56.690 --> 01:00:02.610]  before I outnugget the nuts. Yeah. So the chocolate could lead and also a banana. It's a
[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:10.030]  lot of food stuff. A lot of food stuff lined up that we didn't see coming an hour and a half ago.
[01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:16.190]  Absolutely not. We're a food podcast. Are you OK with us being a food podcast, Derek,
[01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:19.910]  as opposed to baseball? I feel like you kind of didn't like the idea of us being a baseball
[01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:24.810]  podcast. It didn't feel like we ever embraced fully the baseball podcast because Geoff wouldn't
[01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:29.770]  throw the ball. So now I feel like I feel like you're embracing the food, embracing nuggets,
[01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:36.250]  embracing chocolate, being anti-banana, but pro-apple weirdly. I mean, I'm fine with being
[01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:40.890]  I only produce food podcasts at this point. So, yeah, that's fine. OK. Hey, Eric, can I ask you
[01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:44.130]  a question while you're here? Yeah. Yeah. What's up? What's in your what? Do you have anything in
[01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:49.110]  your pockets right now? No, I just put on shorts and I don't have anything in my pockets while I'm
[01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:52.330]  sitting at my desk. Hmm. If you were going to leave the house, what do you think you would
[01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:59.570]  throw in your pockets to leave? I would grab my keys, my phone, my wallet, my mask,
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:07.110]  maybe a chapstick and put it in the little chapstick part of my, you know, like there's
[01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:11.670]  like a little tiny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, well, the iPod Nano goes. Yeah, that's where the iPod
[01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:17.310]  Nano goes. But until I charge that and get it working from 2007, I will just put a chapstick
[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:26.270]  there instead. Those are kind of all of my go to's, I suppose, for what I would need for my
[01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:31.410]  pockets. OK, that's very helpful. Thank you. I yeah, I can see I can see a world where all of
[01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:37.250]  those things live on a wrist easily. I mean, I'm all for what you're talking about here with the
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:43.230]  wrist pack and everything. I know a lot of professional wrestlers who wear unironically
[01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:50.450]  wear fanny packs everywhere, all the time, constantly and swear by them, swear up and
[01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:54.390]  just like I didn't think they would be that helpful. And I never leave without my fanny pack.
[01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:58.630]  They don't have anything in their pockets. Everything is in the fanny pack. I've never
[01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:03.990]  tried. So this is doable. Not I'm not a fan of the fanny pack, but I am a fan of the idea of like
[01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:08.950]  I realize there's some there's some adjacency to what we're doing here. So and that's why I believe
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:15.530]  in uniform. Thank you for believing in uniform. Uniform. Combining the power of one with the
[01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:22.490]  fabric of the form uniform. OK, well, that's great. I think there's a lot of I think keys alone.
[01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:28.290]  There's a lot of opportunity. I can't wait for the magnet approach of this and it being too powerful
[01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:36.490]  and your wrist getting stuck together. That is what I'm very excited about. I was making a note.
[01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.250]  I'm just making notes of what prototype I want to make. And I just found that old.
[01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:43.190]  I found a picture. I think I showed this to Geoff. Andrew, what do you think is happening
[01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:55.490]  in this picture? Oh, I'm excited. Oh, Jesus Christ. OK, well, it's it's like the worst
[01:02:55.490 --> 01:03:04.970]  Spike Jones video or like Michelle Godrey. We're in somebody's mouth. Is that Geoff?
[01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:13.070]  I think that's Geoff. I would have assumed Geoff's mouth. No. It looks like I'm in the photo.
[01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:18.850]  It does, but it's so right now. I just assume it's not the back. The people in the background,
[01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:21.830]  Geoff, is not what you immediately notice when looking at this photo.
[01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:30.530]  This, Andrew, is a a nice. This might be the only one in existence. A nice picture of Geoff
[01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:36.950]  and myself taken from inside minor league fan Jack's mouth. Oh, it's horrendous.
[01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:44.110]  We'll have to we'll have to ask him if he's OK. But I don't think I've ever seen a picture of
[01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:49.610]  people from inside someone's mouth before. Yeah, it's like it's like tongue POV. It's like,
[01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:55.870]  yeah, it's about the same on Jack's tongue. What he's talking. This is this could be the new
[01:03:55.870 --> 01:04:01.610]  Instagram craze inside the mouth portraits. I love this. I would love to see more of these.
[01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:07.350]  It was basically we're in Australia having lunch, I think, and I had my 360 camera out
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:14.270]  and Jack just walked up here. I've late because we we left without him. So we had to get a separate
[01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:18.730]  Uber and then he just walked up while I had that and he just put my camera in his mouth for like
[01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:23.930]  one second. But because it's 360, I then went into the file and it was originally pointed at
[01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:31.590]  the back of his throat, but I just put it around and you can see it. It's so disgusting. It looks
[01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:39.390]  so wet in there. It looks like that Cortana level inhaler. It looks dirty. How many how many bites
[01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:43.530]  does it take for that mouth to eat a nugget is what I want to know. We need to do measurements.
[01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:48.450]  I think it's more like how many nuggets can that bite eaten one that mouth eaten one bite?
[01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:54.830]  It looks not safe for work. No, it looks like alien. There's like a very alien vibe to this.
[01:04:55.370 --> 01:05:02.630]  You never see behind someone's teeth and lips. No, very rarely outside of video games. Like,
[01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:06.510]  I feel like that's always the classic, like, oh, I've morphed into a character. Let me like,
[01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:12.930]  see through their face. Oh, there's a there's a picture of two thirds of this podcast from
[01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:17.190]  inside Jack's mouth. I don't think you could identify somebody from the inside of their
[01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:21.590]  mouth. I don't like without contact. Do you think a dentist could? I bet a dentist could.
[01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:25.590]  I think a dentist probably could. But I don't want to know that about somebody. I don't want
[01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:29.830]  to ever be at a level where someone would be like, oh, imagine if I fucking knew that was Jack's
[01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:33.550]  mouth. That would have crazy. Well, that would have been magical. Like, yeah, it looks like
[01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:39.230]  Jack's mouth. I'd recognize that fourth tooth from the left anywhere. Eric's not a fan of the lips.
[01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:44.790]  There's something about seeing the teeth in like the top of like the roof of the mouth.
[01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:50.650]  That's like, oh, that's gross. For some reason, seeing the lips over the teeth,
[01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:57.730]  but they're the inside of the lips is so like it really I put in the chat this. It looks like a
[01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:04.890]  Cronenberg film. It looks like long live the new flesh, like disgusting, the fly level shit. I
[01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:09.670]  don't like this. Like, I keep looking at it because I can't look away. I want to see a zombie
[01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:15.570]  movie entirely from this perspective of just like one zombie, just like the worst. Terrible.
[01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:21.910]  I think that's a that's a great comp, Eric. It definitely feels very like videodrome esque.
[01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:28.010]  I think maybe if we ever all if we're ever all together at RTX, we should take and we do a
[01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:33.250]  panel. We should take a picture of the entire cast of space from inside Jack's mouth. Oh,
[01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:37.070]  that's a great idea. That's a great. I'm OK with that. That's why. What are you thinking?
[01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:40.550]  Well, I was just going to say, I don't think we need more mouths out there. Like, if anything,
[01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:45.070]  I feel like this photo should be deleted. It's disturbing. I don't want this to be a trend.
[01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:47.370]  Just like the idea of Jack's mouth being a camera.
[01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:54.150]  The weirdest angle for the Truman Show. It's the mouth camera guy.
[01:06:55.750 --> 01:07:00.230]  Maybe that's the next direction we'll move into is taking stuff out of our pockets,
[01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:05.150]  moving into our wrist, then eliminating the wrist altogether and creating mouth mouth products.
[01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:08.790]  I thought you were going to say move everything from the pockets to the mouth.
[01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:13.870]  I was like, no, we should not do that. I just stole my keys to Jack's mouth.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:32.630]  Oh, the smashing sportsman. I love it. He's our guy. He's our guy. I can't think of another
[01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:40.870]  superhero who more deftly exemplifies the face brand than the smashing than the
[01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:45.610]  arthritis ridden smashing sportsman.
[01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:52.150]  It's perfect. He fits us and nobody gives a shit about him. It's fantastic. Like nobody.
[01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:54.950]  I love it. I'm excited for the world to learn about the smashing sports.
[01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.970]  What do you think he's worth?
[01:07:57.950 --> 01:08:03.210]  I don't know. I think if we if we showed that photo of Jack's mouth,
[01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:08.590]  they would just give it away like if we used it as a threat. It's a terrifying image.
[01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:15.350]  And I got to say, one thing I liked about this episode, really light on the fruit talk.
[01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:18.910]  Very light on the fruit. We could even I know we're talking about this before.
[01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:22.410]  Smashing sportsman bats. Potentially that could be a bad thing in the future.
[01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:26.090]  Yeah, the bats. We sell bats. A lot of opportunities.
[01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:30.770]  There's a lot of opportunities there. That's two pretty good episodes there.
[01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.110]  Yeah, two really good. I'm excited for next week.
[01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:37.870]  Yeah, I'm I'm so excited for next week. I didn't I was afraid we wouldn't be able to
[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.290]  cram all this into two episodes. And not only did we we crammed like banana content,
[01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:46.070]  we crammed chocolate. There was a lot of directions we went that I didn't even expect.
[01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:51.010]  We talked about Dusty Baker for like 16 minutes, which is not what I anticipated.
[01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:56.350]  Yeah, but but what a mindfuck to find out that the high five,
[01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.670]  the high fucking five was invented in 1977.
[01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:04.530]  A lot of shite, but I believe it for a second. A lot of bollocks.
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:14.670]  Well, Gavin, I can tell you as someone who lived in the before times, it was dark.
[01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:19.430]  We didn't know how to. There's a lot of patent on the back. It didn't feel quite right.
[01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.970]  Things were a little bit more homophobic back then, so we didn't pat each other on the butt.
[01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:27.710]  It was we didn't celebrate properly. We just didn't. And I remember the I remember the great day
[01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:34.170]  when everything changed. And I can see how the only living in a world full of high fives,
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:40.570]  it would be hard for you to comprehend a world without. But it I was there. It was dark.
[01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:44.590]  And you should you should hope that we never get plunged back into that darkness again.
[01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:49.030]  Thank you for listening to another episode of Face. I believe this was the
[01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:57.670]  75th iteration of this podcast and probably the 65th to mention some sort of a food related
[01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:02.950]  challenge. If you liked it, tell somebody about it, because that's how we survive.
[01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:06.230]  And if you don't tell somebody about it, one of us will die. Thanks for listening.
