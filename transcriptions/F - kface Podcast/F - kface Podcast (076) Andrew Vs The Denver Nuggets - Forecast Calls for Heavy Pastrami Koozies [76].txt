[00:31.020 --> 00:35.320]  Has there been a big appearance by heroin since Breaking Bad and that arc?
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.760]  Was heroin a big part of Breaking Bad?
[00:37.940 --> 00:38.180]  No.
[00:38.260 --> 00:38.860]  Yeah, I think it was meth.
[00:38.940 --> 00:40.540]  I'm not saying the drug he made.
[00:40.540 --> 00:45.380]  We're talking about heroin and Jesse's girlfriend.
[00:45.800 --> 00:48.460]  And Jesse got... they were super into heroin for like a season.
[00:48.800 --> 00:51.340]  And then she dies of the overdose.
[00:51.540 --> 00:53.220]  Oh, yeah, fucking...
[00:53.220 --> 00:54.420]  Krista Ritter or whatever.
[00:54.420 --> 00:55.060]  Yeah, the Marvel character.
[00:55.300 --> 00:56.680]  Right? Yeah.
[00:56.680 --> 00:58.480]  Yeah, Kristen Ritter.
[00:59.020 --> 01:01.000]  That's like maybe the best scene in that show.
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.000]  Well, I think that scene is like...
[01:03.000 --> 01:03.200]  Really?
[01:03.400 --> 01:04.560]  That's where everything's different.
[01:04.780 --> 01:09.100]  Like, that's a very like easy marked turning point for like that whole show.
[01:09.100 --> 01:12.420]  That is a huge moral turning point right there.
[01:12.560 --> 01:12.660]  Yeah.
[01:12.840 --> 01:15.520]  Where you're like, you're rooting and you can root.
[01:15.820 --> 01:20.160]  But then that happens and you go, oh, not the character that I thought this was.
[01:20.440 --> 01:21.900]  And then that's really where the show...
[01:21.900 --> 01:23.140]  I don't think you're wrong.
[01:23.240 --> 01:25.020]  I just wouldn't have instinctually thought that.
[01:25.160 --> 01:28.740]  I wouldn't have even put that in my top 10 of memorable Breaking Bad moments.
[01:29.160 --> 01:31.420]  Oh, I just think that's where the show...
[01:31.420 --> 01:32.660]  We're talking Breaking Bad stopped.
[01:32.840 --> 01:33.440]  Well, I guess he did.
[01:33.620 --> 01:34.700]  Yeah, it's just pivotal, right?
[01:35.440 --> 01:35.640]  Yeah.
[01:36.000 --> 01:36.920]  What are you talking about?
[01:37.460 --> 01:37.860]  Heroin.
[01:37.860 --> 01:40.800]  I said maybe like the one of the like the best moment of that show.
[01:40.880 --> 01:48.680]  Like the show where it marks a real turning point is when he watches when Walt watches Jesse's girlfriend die from heroin.
[01:48.980 --> 01:50.100]  Like she has like an overdose.
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.200]  She's fucking like choking and he just like lets her die because that's for purely for personal gain.
[01:55.940 --> 01:59.500]  And it to me really marks a shift in that show.
[01:59.680 --> 02:01.220]  And yeah, a shift in the audience size.
[02:01.500 --> 02:05.680]  As well as him mowing that guy down and then shooting him in the head was also like a...
[02:05.680 --> 02:06.960]  Okay, he's all the way.
[02:07.080 --> 02:07.320]  Yeah.
[02:07.400 --> 02:07.780]  He's all in.
[02:09.320 --> 02:16.360]  I think like the first moment for that with me is when he chokes the guy out in the basement with the thing and he's like trying to stab him with the plug.
[02:16.520 --> 02:21.180]  It's just so messy and like it's such a you cannot come back from this moment.
[02:21.320 --> 02:22.720]  There's no reversing at this point.
[02:22.780 --> 02:24.300]  You are gone down a path.
[02:24.500 --> 02:35.580]  I was talking about Gavin to Nick how I feel you gave one of the worst takes I've ever heard and I'd forgotten all about it which led to a heroin take.
[02:35.860 --> 02:37.260]  It's an insane take by you.
[02:37.260 --> 02:39.420]  Are we in on the episode?
[02:39.580 --> 02:40.830]  Yeah, I think we should talk about it.
[02:44.320 --> 02:45.440]  Do we do an intro?
[02:45.540 --> 02:46.100]  Do we just start?
[02:46.300 --> 02:46.460]  I don't know.
[02:46.500 --> 02:46.980]  That's great.
[02:47.140 --> 02:48.400]  What's the protocol for this?
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.360]  Yeah, we typically...
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.140]  We always...
[02:50.140 --> 02:52.120]  It's not an episode if we don't start it, right?
[02:52.220 --> 02:53.160]  We always...
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.240]  We pride ourselves on it.
[02:54.560 --> 02:55.440]  So go ahead and take it away, Andrew.
[02:55.540 --> 02:57.740]  We must only have like 26 episodes.
[03:00.340 --> 03:01.460]  That's a great question.
[03:01.580 --> 03:02.980]  Like how many intros have we done?
[03:03.800 --> 03:07.040]  Hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face.
[03:07.040 --> 03:14.980]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always Andrew Panton from Canada and Gavin Free from England.
[03:15.540 --> 03:20.560]  And then also somewhere back there, Nick and Eric are giving each other handjobs while we talk.
[03:20.840 --> 03:21.920]  This is episode 76.
[03:22.100 --> 03:22.340]  Go.
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.800]  Where is Nick from?
[03:24.240 --> 03:25.440]  I know where Eric is from.
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.860]  At least I feel like I do.
[03:27.300 --> 03:27.580]  Santa...
[03:27.580 --> 03:27.820]  Okay.
[03:28.240 --> 03:28.880]  Hey, there we go.
[03:29.060 --> 03:30.740]  Why did we do the locations, Geoff?
[03:30.840 --> 03:31.340]  What was...
[03:31.340 --> 03:32.640]  What's the inspiration for that today?
[03:32.700 --> 03:33.740]  I think it's interesting.
[03:33.980 --> 03:35.720]  I think it's the most interesting thing about either of you.
[03:35.940 --> 03:36.300]  Really?
[03:36.300 --> 03:37.800]  The place that...
[03:37.800 --> 03:38.580]  I can get... I can get down.
[03:38.660 --> 03:39.980]  I can... I can set a tone immediately.
[03:40.140 --> 03:44.300]  Now people... people know something about you that it instantly points...
[03:44.760 --> 03:51.000]  I mean, it's pretty clear that I'm from America based on my brash manner of speaking and accent.
[03:51.280 --> 03:53.380]  But then now they immediately put a frame in their head.
[03:53.440 --> 03:56.120]  They see a triangle of England and the United States.
[03:56.220 --> 03:57.840]  A great English speaking triangle.
[03:58.020 --> 04:00.520]  I feel like the England... the England part is obvious.
[04:00.780 --> 04:03.300]  The Canadian aspect of the show is less obvious.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.660]  I'll be honest with you, Gavin.
[04:04.660 --> 04:09.380]  I don't know that you're... this podcast takes place in America, mostly.
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.100]  And I would say that we... well, I am excited to report we have a global audience.
[04:15.280 --> 04:17.680]  I would say a large portion of our audience is America.
[04:17.940 --> 04:23.580]  And to your average American, Australians, Brits and South Africans all are kind of interchangeable.
[04:23.700 --> 04:26.900]  I don't... I don't think that's true.
[04:27.500 --> 04:28.480]  In terms of accents?
[04:28.760 --> 04:28.880]  Yeah.
[04:29.160 --> 04:29.380]  Yeah.
[04:29.480 --> 04:29.680]  Yeah.
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.120]  There's a lot of Americans that could not tell you if their life depended on it.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.960]  The difference between a South African or a British accent.
[04:36.960 --> 04:37.980]  Yeah, I would agree.
[04:38.460 --> 04:40.760]  Look, Eric's backing me up in the comments.
[04:41.460 --> 04:42.440]  I agree, too.
[04:43.160 --> 04:43.740]  They're very similar.
[04:43.980 --> 04:48.460]  Well, they're not like... once you know the difference, you know, like I feel like
[04:48.460 --> 04:52.100]  Charlotte O'Copley was a really big deal for the South African accent.
[04:52.280 --> 04:53.820]  I feel like that really highlighted it.
[04:53.880 --> 05:00.120]  Outside of that, I can't think of anybody who is like popular actor-wise that was like South African and like big accent.
[05:00.120 --> 05:01.340]  Charlize Theron is South African, right?
[05:01.340 --> 05:04.300]  I know, but not... I don't... I don't feel like she has an accent in the same way.
[05:04.980 --> 05:07.480]  Not as noticeable to me, but maybe I'm just proving the point.
[05:07.820 --> 05:08.620]  I can't hear it.
[05:08.880 --> 05:09.520]  I don't see it.
[05:09.880 --> 05:12.340]  Yeah, it's like trying to tell the difference between Australia and New Zealand.
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.640]  It's very similar for us.
[05:13.740 --> 05:14.800]  It's... it's... it's hard to do.
[05:15.240 --> 05:15.980]  Yeah, it's pretty similar.
[05:17.320 --> 05:20.460]  Eric says, yeah, Gavin, you sound like Taika Waititi to me.
[05:24.220 --> 05:25.480]  We have so much to talk about.
[05:28.860 --> 05:31.000]  I don't think Gavin saw any of that coming.
[05:33.220 --> 05:35.480]  We do have a lot to talk about.
[05:36.020 --> 05:37.460]  Just a quick rundown.
[05:39.220 --> 05:41.860]  We... Andrew, you conducted an experiment.
[05:42.220 --> 05:44.260]  You... you went up against the Denver Knights.
[05:44.260 --> 05:46.260]  You went up against an entire NBA team.
[05:46.440 --> 05:49.820]  One of the better... definitely a top 12 team in the NBA.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.320]  Reigning MVP plays for that team.
[05:52.380 --> 05:55.760]  And you took them on without four friends, but by yourself.
[05:56.180 --> 06:00.040]  Then I... the other one, Gavin and I, we threw baseballs.
[06:00.040 --> 06:01.500]  So we got all that to talk about.
[06:01.660 --> 06:06.560]  I would also like to mention that we should talk about Gavin had his first Route 44.
[06:07.280 --> 06:11.120]  And that was a very exciting and hilarious experience.
[06:11.820 --> 06:13.300]  Also get it to as well.
[06:13.360 --> 06:15.160]  And maybe he can even share the video with you guys.
[06:15.240 --> 06:16.280]  Although I doubt he'll put it online.
[06:17.060 --> 06:18.500]  I... what is a Route 44?
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.080]  That's what I thought.
[06:22.140 --> 06:24.660]  I... we should get to it in the... in the natural course of things.
[06:24.700 --> 06:26.500]  So I think we should start with the nuggets.
[06:26.720 --> 06:27.920]  Are we doing chocolate today?
[06:28.160 --> 06:28.600]  Oh, we're...
[06:28.600 --> 06:29.680]  Oh, we got chocolate today.
[06:29.800 --> 06:30.660]  Holy shit.
[06:31.120 --> 06:31.980]  We have too much.
[06:31.980 --> 06:34.260]  I should mention that Andrew moved the recording.
[06:34.780 --> 06:35.980]  It's... it was a rare one for Andrew.
[06:36.120 --> 06:38.080]  He was feeling a bit poorly.
[06:39.940 --> 06:42.380]  Totally blue balls to me for... what's it been?
[06:42.440 --> 06:42.900]  Four days?
[06:43.020 --> 06:43.360]  Five days?
[06:43.380 --> 06:43.900]  I apologize.
[06:44.380 --> 06:44.900]  I think I...
[06:44.900 --> 06:45.040]  It's fine.
[06:45.080 --> 06:45.560]  Don't worry about it.
[06:45.560 --> 06:48.580]  I was just... I'm really, really excited about the chocolate.
[06:49.320 --> 06:55.520]  I gotta say the... the temperature on social, chocolate confidence is through the roof amongst the audience.
[06:55.520 --> 07:02.040]  The comment leavers are all independently working their up... working up their chocolate tolerance to build their confidence.
[07:02.180 --> 07:05.400]  I'm amazed at how well this is, like, the people have latched on.
[07:05.540 --> 07:11.640]  I'm honestly blown away at, like, the... just... just from what I've seen on the Instagram stories, the, uh, f***face Instagram stories.
[07:11.940 --> 07:13.900]  Everyone has been buying this chocolate.
[07:14.060 --> 07:17.020]  I can't imagine, like, that being, like, an ad read.
[07:17.120 --> 07:22.700]  I spent, like, ten minutes shitting on how bad that chocolate was and it's caused so many sales.
[07:22.880 --> 07:23.900]  I'm blown away by it.
[07:23.940 --> 07:24.580]  I'm so excited.
[07:24.580 --> 07:28.180]  I... I almost bought some just because I saw it at the store.
[07:29.140 --> 07:31.360]  And I went, oh, there's the chocolate I should get.
[07:31.420 --> 07:32.600]  And then I went, wait, I'm not doing this.
[07:32.820 --> 07:33.220]  Let's f*** them.
[07:33.800 --> 07:34.040]  But...
[07:34.040 --> 07:34.660]  You didn't buy it?
[07:35.340 --> 07:35.640]  No.
[07:35.840 --> 07:37.180]  Because it's not my... it's not my content.
[07:37.260 --> 07:37.780]  No, that's fair.
[07:38.200 --> 07:38.660]  That's fair.
[07:38.820 --> 07:40.200]  We'll see how I feel after.
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.360]  I mean, we have... there's another thing that, uh, I... I think you guys probably possibly even forgot.
[07:45.540 --> 07:46.480]  We're prototypes.
[07:46.920 --> 07:48.260]  You wanted prototypes, Geoff?
[07:48.320 --> 07:48.660]  Oh, yeah.
[07:48.820 --> 07:49.680]  You got us ready.
[07:49.900 --> 07:50.400]  We got prototypes.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.360]  I filmed a video.
[07:51.840 --> 07:53.800]  Oh, this is... this is very exciting.
[07:53.800 --> 07:54.640]  Did you do one, Andrew?
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.500]  Oh, I... you bet I did.
[07:56.680 --> 07:57.800]  I got... I'm wearing mine right now.
[07:58.120 --> 07:59.440]  We have so much going on at the same time.
[07:59.440 --> 08:00.740]  I got my prototype going right now.
[08:01.000 --> 08:01.820]  What do we want to start with?
[08:01.920 --> 08:02.580]  Here's the thing.
[08:02.700 --> 08:03.860]  We have too much episode.
[08:04.100 --> 08:06.860]  We can't... we can't get all this into one episode.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.180]  We might as well just acknowledge that and admit...
[08:09.180 --> 08:12.160]  We're going to have to cut some of this stuff and move it to Thursday's recording.
[08:12.540 --> 08:13.100]  Oh, for sure.
[08:13.300 --> 08:15.840]  So, uh, what do we want to talk about the most?
[08:16.160 --> 08:17.120]  Because we should do that now.
[08:17.160 --> 08:19.160]  I think the nuggets are probably the most time sensitive.
[08:19.740 --> 08:21.860]  I think the nuggets is a thing to mention.
[08:21.860 --> 08:24.080]  I feel like we kind of talked about already.
[08:24.320 --> 08:26.880]  Do we just go into Gavin's worst take of all time?
[08:26.940 --> 08:27.360]  Go for it.
[08:27.800 --> 08:31.580]  So, I turn my phone on Saturday, like 6 p.m.
[08:31.640 --> 08:33.000]  My time, having a great day.
[08:33.060 --> 08:33.540]  That's so weird.
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.040]  What's weird?
[08:35.280 --> 08:37.400]  Everything you just said was weird.
[08:37.880 --> 08:39.940]  I turned my phone on is weird.
[08:40.300 --> 08:41.900]  6 p.m. is weird.
[08:42.300 --> 08:43.040]  Okay, listen.
[08:43.360 --> 08:44.140]  I'm not...
[08:44.140 --> 08:44.700]  It's 100% weird.
[08:44.880 --> 08:47.000]  My phone does not own me, Geoff.
[08:47.280 --> 08:47.640]  Okay?
[08:47.940 --> 08:50.000]  My phone died the previous evening.
[08:50.020 --> 08:51.640]  Okay, Tyler Durden, I got it.
[08:51.640 --> 08:53.400]  I'm not a big phone guy.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.120]  Not a big phone guy.
[08:55.340 --> 08:56.560]  Don't use it all that much.
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.760]  Don't need it, really.
[08:58.040 --> 08:59.740]  Didn't expect anything on it.
[09:00.100 --> 09:01.740]  It was back of my mind all day.
[09:01.800 --> 09:03.200]  I was having the greatest fucking day.
[09:03.600 --> 09:04.260]  It was sunny out.
[09:04.600 --> 09:07.780]  It started because we were doing baseball stuff.
[09:07.940 --> 09:12.200]  We were talking about the baseball plan and Andrew just chimes in 6 p.m. on Saturday.
[09:12.760 --> 09:17.020]  Turning my phone on to these texts is like waking up to Christmas morning.
[09:17.560 --> 09:20.640]  Immediately, I was not interested in the baseball stuff anymore.
[09:20.640 --> 09:23.760]  I just wrote, who turns on their phone at 6 p.m.?
[09:23.760 --> 09:25.260]  Okay, so here's the problem.
[09:25.620 --> 09:29.500]  When my phone turns on and I get text messages, it tells me when it turned on.
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.440]  Not when they were sent.
[09:30.520 --> 09:33.300]  So I have no point of reference for when your conversation happened.
[09:33.700 --> 09:36.620]  I didn't know there was any baseball talk to be had.
[09:36.940 --> 09:39.040]  End of day, charging my phone.
[09:39.140 --> 09:40.440]  I'm like, I'll turn it on.
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.000]  I'll just check, see what's going on.
[09:42.000 --> 09:42.820]  If I got any messages.
[09:43.120 --> 09:43.860]  I get all those.
[09:44.240 --> 09:45.680]  Genuinely was so excited.
[09:45.880 --> 09:47.440]  I didn't know the baseball throw was happening.
[09:47.800 --> 09:48.600]  Didn't expect it.
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.780]  It was, as I said, it was like waking up not knowing it was Christmas morning.
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.020]  And there are all these gifts as messages of this throw is happening.
[09:56.380 --> 09:58.300]  I'm now excited for the next day.
[09:58.560 --> 10:04.440]  I was trying to just share my enthusiasm with the two of you of how excited I was.
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.240]  We jumped down your throat immediately.
[10:09.080 --> 10:09.880]  Gavin replies.
[10:09.940 --> 10:10.800]  I don't know why I'm saying this.
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.040]  You should say you're the one who sent it.
[10:12.100 --> 10:13.420]  This is done by me to interject.
[10:13.740 --> 10:15.560]  Would you want me to read out just this brief part?
[10:15.720 --> 10:16.200]  Yeah, go ahead.
[10:16.760 --> 10:18.540]  I said who turns on their phone at 6 p.m.
[10:18.640 --> 10:20.740]  You just, you said I just did.
[10:21.060 --> 10:23.400]  I said that is the most disturbing thing ever.
[10:23.820 --> 10:25.840]  Like you just came off a heroin bender.
[10:26.260 --> 10:27.040]  You said what?
[10:27.200 --> 10:28.180]  I said you heard.
[10:28.380 --> 10:29.560]  You said you are ridiculous.
[10:30.240 --> 10:32.900]  This might be the worst take you have ever had.
[10:34.280 --> 10:36.500]  I don't understand why that's weird.
[10:36.640 --> 10:37.960]  I don't use my phone a lot.
[10:38.040 --> 10:39.580]  I have no point of using the phone.
[10:40.060 --> 10:42.360]  Well, firstly, who turns off a phone to be honest.
[10:42.540 --> 10:42.720]  Smartphone.
[10:42.900 --> 10:43.360]  It died.
[10:43.780 --> 10:44.480]  It died.
[10:45.100 --> 10:46.240]  I didn't turn it off.
[10:46.320 --> 10:46.920]  It died.
[10:47.200 --> 10:48.500]  That's battery life.
[10:48.660 --> 10:50.900]  You're in your, what, late 20s?
[10:51.120 --> 10:56.500]  How do you have no responsibilities anywhere that you could just sit with your phone off all day?
[10:56.800 --> 10:57.780]  What if there's an emergency?
[10:58.420 --> 11:00.320]  I'd find out the following day.
[11:00.340 --> 11:01.340]  Listen, I have email.
[11:02.020 --> 11:04.860]  There are ways you can reach me if you need to reach me.
[11:05.100 --> 11:06.700]  I just am not a big phone guy.
[11:07.020 --> 11:08.380]  I get very few calls.
[11:08.960 --> 11:09.880]  Almost no texts.
[11:10.040 --> 11:10.860]  Can I ask you a question?
[11:11.280 --> 11:11.500]  Yeah.
[11:11.500 --> 11:15.120]  Does Raymond Somer turn his phone off as well?
[11:15.320 --> 11:16.240]  Or does that one stay on?
[11:16.460 --> 11:17.280]  That one's always on.
[11:17.900 --> 11:18.820]  That's an always on phone.
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.520]  It looks as though Eric doesn't agree with you.
[11:21.640 --> 11:21.840]  Eric?
[11:22.900 --> 11:24.040]  It's a terrible take.
[11:24.200 --> 11:24.620]  I don't.
[11:24.700 --> 11:29.020]  I just don't understand how that's the worst take that Gavin can have.
[11:29.240 --> 11:29.940]  It's like, okay.
[11:30.420 --> 11:33.900]  Well, I mean like, but he, but I agree with him.
[11:34.140 --> 11:34.420]  I agree.
[11:34.580 --> 11:36.180]  It's like, oh, it's like you just got off a heroin.
[11:36.200 --> 11:39.240]  But there's so many people that I know that are just like, yeah.
[11:39.240 --> 11:43.200]  I just had a crate like an insane weekend and just on stuff and not
[11:43.200 --> 11:44.460]  wanting to be around their phones.
[11:44.640 --> 11:46.060]  So it reads that way to me too.
[11:46.180 --> 11:47.100]  So I don't know.
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.640]  I think I just live in a different fucking world.
[11:50.780 --> 11:54.440]  I like I'm not I'm not gonna part like you think I'm on a bender.
[11:54.700 --> 11:55.820]  I don't really drink.
[11:56.200 --> 11:57.860]  I'm not a party guy at all.
[11:58.060 --> 12:01.560]  Like I would just never think that so it was insane to me.
[12:01.900 --> 12:05.840]  You also did text in the same chain because I was on it as well.
[12:06.100 --> 12:07.000]  And I have pulled it up.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.160]  You said this seems like a good time to reveal.
[12:09.420 --> 12:10.480]  I'm a big heroin guy.
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.200]  Yeah.
[12:11.260 --> 12:13.720]  Well, I mean, that's just a joke because I was I thought this was
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.540]  Oh, so you're not actually a heroin guy.
[12:15.560 --> 12:15.780]  No, I'm not.
[12:15.780 --> 12:16.780]  I would like to point out too.
[12:16.980 --> 12:18.100]  Mine was also a joke.
[12:18.320 --> 12:21.500]  I actually didn't think you were on heroin all night.
[12:22.500 --> 12:24.140]  But it's a weird thing to even imply.
[12:24.840 --> 12:26.000]  No, it isn't.
[12:26.160 --> 12:26.520]  Yeah.
[12:26.720 --> 12:28.260]  Imagining someone waking up at six.
[12:28.520 --> 12:30.320]  That's that's all I was comparing it to.
[12:30.420 --> 12:31.700]  I would I would never.
[12:31.820 --> 12:32.900]  Well, there's no indication.
[12:33.020 --> 12:33.920]  I woke up at six.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.880]  Like that's a huge leap for me to even like when you say
[12:36.880 --> 12:38.800]  that I got up at like 7 a.m.
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.180]  that day.
[12:39.280 --> 12:40.120]  I had a full day.
[12:40.880 --> 12:42.580]  I just hadn't had my phone on.
[12:42.820 --> 12:44.100]  You were up for 11 hours.
[12:44.540 --> 12:44.940]  Yeah.
[12:45.160 --> 12:46.700]  On a Saturday without a phone.
[12:47.020 --> 12:47.440]  Yeah, I know.
[12:47.640 --> 12:48.380]  I think it's awesome.
[12:48.740 --> 12:49.860]  People used to do it.
[12:49.980 --> 12:51.700]  I used to do it before cell phones.
[12:51.980 --> 12:55.040]  Yeah, I just don't remember what it was like in it.
[12:55.220 --> 12:55.860]  Like, how was it?
[12:55.880 --> 12:56.680]  It was Saturday.
[12:56.920 --> 12:58.960]  Like, I don't understand like that's what you do.
[12:59.020 --> 12:59.880]  What'd you do that day?
[13:00.020 --> 13:02.200]  Well, how'd you how'd you occupy your 11 hours?
[13:02.560 --> 13:03.900]  What did I do on Saturday?
[13:04.500 --> 13:04.900]  Fuck.
[13:04.900 --> 13:05.500]  What did I do?
[13:05.500 --> 13:07.480]  If you had your phone with you, you could have taken a photo
[13:07.480 --> 13:08.440]  and then you'd be like...
[13:08.440 --> 13:14.000]  Oh, I think I cleaned my closet out on Saturday.
[13:14.320 --> 13:15.440]  That may have been a Sunday thing.
[13:15.860 --> 13:17.840]  Yeah, I spent a whole day there on Saturday.
[13:17.980 --> 13:18.600]  So I don't remember.
[13:18.840 --> 13:21.400]  This isn't really helping my argument against like...
[13:23.480 --> 13:24.560]  It was a pretty uneventful day.
[13:24.580 --> 13:25.600]  I think I played games.
[13:25.680 --> 13:28.140]  I think I was playing Far Cry most of Saturday.
[13:28.480 --> 13:29.380]  It's a good game that Far Cry.
[13:29.900 --> 13:30.700]  Yeah, it's fine.
[13:30.900 --> 13:32.060]  It's another one of those.
[13:32.760 --> 13:34.820]  They made a really big deal about Gus being in it.
[13:34.820 --> 13:35.900]  And he's like barely in it.
[13:36.140 --> 13:36.760]  It's fine.
[13:37.040 --> 13:37.900]  It's a decent game.
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.660]  Yeah, but uneventful.
[13:39.780 --> 13:41.020]  I just thought it was a crazy take.
[13:41.080 --> 13:41.640]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[13:41.720 --> 13:44.880]  Maybe I just am like so disconnected from like party
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.680]  world that it would never cross my mind.
[13:47.820 --> 13:50.240]  I was honestly worried because you reacted so strongly to it.
[13:50.280 --> 13:51.600]  I was like, oh, maybe I've touched on something here.
[13:51.660 --> 13:54.500]  Maybe you used to be a heroin addict and I've just brought up
[13:54.500 --> 13:55.360]  something that you don't want to talk about.
[13:55.380 --> 14:00.040]  Or like he had a twin brother who died of a heroin overdose.
[14:00.180 --> 14:00.740]  We just had never heard about.
[14:00.740 --> 14:01.160]  Something like that.
[14:01.240 --> 14:01.400]  Yeah.
[14:01.760 --> 14:03.060]  Yeah, I'm right there with you.
[14:03.060 --> 14:06.120]  See, I had a different anxiety approach where I was like, I'm
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.600]  very against this take, but not really.
[14:07.740 --> 14:10.340]  Like it's a crazy take in my head, but I'm not upset by this
[14:10.340 --> 14:13.120]  in any way, but it's just fun to argue in this context.
[14:13.620 --> 14:15.540]  I was like, I hope you don't think I'm actually mad.
[14:16.140 --> 14:16.380]  Oh, no.
[14:16.380 --> 14:17.260]  That was my approach.
[14:17.440 --> 14:17.940]  Hey, you know what?
[14:17.960 --> 14:19.440]  I think we covered that topic pretty well.
[14:19.520 --> 14:20.480]  Do you want to move on to another one?
[14:20.900 --> 14:21.220]  Yeah.
[14:21.800 --> 14:22.800]  We got no time.
[14:22.940 --> 14:23.620]  We got no time.
[14:24.200 --> 14:26.000]  Okay, we're moving right along.
[14:26.140 --> 14:26.640]  Should we talk about the nuggets?
[14:27.280 --> 14:28.560]  Yeah, let's talk about the nuggets.
[14:30.800 --> 14:31.520]  Didn't go well.
[14:32.180 --> 14:33.380]  Didn't win the nugget thing.
[14:35.340 --> 14:36.060]  I didn't.
[14:36.160 --> 14:37.000]  So we had a plan.
[14:37.120 --> 14:41.620]  We talked about recording it in some aspect, and all I ended
[14:41.620 --> 14:44.260]  up doing was recording an intro for it, which I haven't gotten
[14:44.260 --> 14:47.300]  rid of, but I was like, yeah, this is going to be easy.
[14:47.480 --> 14:48.380]  I feel great about that.
[14:48.560 --> 14:51.180]  I felt so fucking sick by the end of the first quarter.
[14:51.220 --> 14:52.440]  I was going through quarterly updates.
[14:52.540 --> 14:53.940]  It's like, I just, I have no words.
[14:54.020 --> 14:55.180]  There's no words for me to say.
[14:55.600 --> 14:56.460]  It was brutal.
[14:57.040 --> 15:00.180]  The time of possession was an issue, a thing that I did not
[15:00.180 --> 15:02.880]  consider, which was like really like where you got to get
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.300]  your nuggets in, free throws. Because Dallas maintains the ball
[15:07.300 --> 15:09.360]  and it's like a long kind of slow stretch.
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.200]  That's a good time.
[15:10.420 --> 15:13.620]  It's really the pace that gets you, is the problem, is what
[15:13.620 --> 15:13.940]  I learned.
[15:14.120 --> 15:17.560]  Well, having to stuff them in while your team has possession.
[15:17.900 --> 15:20.180]  Yeah, like that was the really tough part.
[15:20.320 --> 15:22.880]  And because you feel like so pressured to like, I got to get
[15:22.880 --> 15:24.420]  more nuggets in at this time.
[15:24.440 --> 15:25.280]  There's no break.
[15:25.380 --> 15:28.800]  Like, it's mentally exhausting, as well as the physical being
[15:28.800 --> 15:31.100]  full. I ate like a box of 20.
[15:31.240 --> 15:32.500]  I want to say in three minutes.
[15:34.740 --> 15:39.600]  Should we point out at this point that that adherence to that
[15:39.600 --> 15:40.600]  rule is all you.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.100]  None of us wanted you to only eat during the Dallas possession.
[15:44.360 --> 15:45.760]  We all thought you should eat the whole time.
[15:45.860 --> 15:46.620]  Well, I think it only makes...
[15:46.620 --> 15:49.280]  I mean, I guess it makes sense to you, but you're making it
[15:49.280 --> 15:50.380]  harder on yourself for no...
[15:50.380 --> 15:52.100]  It's already a monumental task.
[15:53.160 --> 15:56.000]  You didn't need to add this additional handicap.
[15:57.140 --> 15:58.460]  I just, it's the confidence.
[15:58.460 --> 15:59.040]  I believed.
[15:59.160 --> 16:00.280]  I didn't think it would be that bad.
[16:00.360 --> 16:02.260]  He's doing nuggets with all the skulls on.
[16:04.120 --> 16:07.400]  You're doing lasso nuggets, man.
[16:10.420 --> 16:11.640]  That's fucking merch.
[16:15.200 --> 16:16.500]  Nuggets all skulls on.
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.320]  We have to set that to the same font and design as the NASA logo.
[16:23.620 --> 16:24.420]  It just says NASA.
[16:31.640 --> 16:32.980]  Please make it NASA.
[16:34.380 --> 16:36.900]  Speaking of which, where's the damn...
[16:36.900 --> 16:39.800]  I don't want to get off on a tangent, but real quick, while
[16:39.800 --> 16:40.980]  we're in that part of it.
[16:41.680 --> 16:47.520]  Where's the goddamn Go Go Now welcome mat for houses and the
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.940]  Go Go Now shark shirt?
[16:49.140 --> 16:54.480]  And weren't we going to make a bunch of Jet Ski merch too?
[16:54.660 --> 16:55.600]  We got Jet Ski merch.
[16:55.600 --> 16:56.800]  Is any of that stuff coming out?
[16:56.800 --> 16:58.900]  I don't know what happened to...
[16:58.900 --> 17:00.880]  I don't know if I should talk about it, but there was a certain
[17:00.880 --> 17:04.080]  drinking apparatus that I feel like it's been in the works for
[17:04.080 --> 17:04.580]  quite a while.
[17:04.720 --> 17:05.720]  Yeah, we got a drink in there.
[17:06.040 --> 17:08.800]  I believe we had a conversation about making ping pong balls
[17:08.800 --> 17:10.140]  that say 19 on them too.
[17:14.540 --> 17:15.340]  We talked...
[17:15.340 --> 17:19.080]  There is a mode of transportation that is...
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.800]  I don't know when that will release.
[17:21.480 --> 17:22.040]  That's a thing.
[17:23.240 --> 17:26.540]  Okay, so anyway, you ate 20 nuggets in the first three
[17:26.540 --> 17:26.920]  minutes.
[17:27.600 --> 17:30.400]  What is your mindset after that?
[17:30.460 --> 17:31.440]  Like that first 20 nuggets?
[17:31.500 --> 17:32.060]  How do you feel?
[17:33.240 --> 17:34.460]  Honestly, not too bad.
[17:34.740 --> 17:37.280]  So I just want to caveat something I didn't even consider
[17:37.280 --> 17:38.320]  a great part of this.
[17:38.860 --> 17:41.380]  Currently McDonald's Canada is doing their Monopoly promotion.
[17:41.800 --> 17:43.720]  I got so many fucking game pieces.
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.840]  Every 20 box had four.
[17:46.100 --> 17:47.720]  The drink had like two.
[17:48.080 --> 17:48.920]  I got a few different things.
[17:48.980 --> 17:49.800]  I even got a fries.
[17:49.920 --> 17:50.580]  I was so confident.
[17:50.720 --> 17:52.600]  I'm like, yeah, I'll get a little snack on the side.
[17:52.860 --> 17:53.560]  I want some fries.
[17:54.660 --> 17:55.860]  Damn the 20 nuggets.
[17:56.540 --> 17:58.280]  I would felt pretty good at that point.
[17:58.580 --> 18:01.500]  Well, I know that because the burgers you said you knew
[18:01.500 --> 18:03.080]  immediately that you're in trouble.
[18:03.340 --> 18:05.820]  Like did you do 20 nuggets before you realize you're in
[18:05.820 --> 18:06.060]  trouble?
[18:06.660 --> 18:07.560]  I was so confident.
[18:07.780 --> 18:10.720]  So I first I got like a hundred ten nuggets in the first run
[18:10.720 --> 18:14.360]  and then I hand counted each box and one of the boxes they
[18:14.360 --> 18:15.080]  gave me 21.
[18:15.380 --> 18:16.760]  I just ate the nugget on the spot.
[18:16.780 --> 18:18.880]  I was like, I just want a little snack because I was hungry.
[18:19.320 --> 18:20.540]  That was the worst part.
[18:20.620 --> 18:22.740]  So there are so many strategic mistakes.
[18:22.840 --> 18:23.300]  I made one.
[18:23.300 --> 18:26.280]  I ordered the nuggets like 45 minutes before tip-off and
[18:26.280 --> 18:27.340]  the game started late.
[18:28.020 --> 18:31.560]  So by the time the second quarter rolled around I got cold
[18:31.560 --> 18:35.980]  kind of rubbery nuggets and just texturally it was less a
[18:35.980 --> 18:39.880]  space thing and more of a rhythm of eating with the possession
[18:39.880 --> 18:44.160]  and also just the texture being the same shitty texture on
[18:44.160 --> 18:44.900]  every nugget.
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.280]  Eric brought up in the chat a fantastic question of did I use
[18:49.280 --> 18:51.580]  sauce? Not only did I use sauce.
[18:51.580 --> 18:51.920]  Okay.
[18:52.020 --> 18:53.280]  I went into my own supply.
[18:53.460 --> 18:55.400]  I pulled out some of those BTS sauces.
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.600]  I went through like five or six sweet chili BTS sauces.
[18:59.780 --> 19:00.780]  It's fantastic.
[19:04.020 --> 19:07.080]  Eric watched the game at a bar and got, oh, you were telling
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.600]  people about the nug that was going on the nug challenge?
[19:09.940 --> 19:13.480]  I went, I was in San Diego for the weekend and we were going
[19:13.480 --> 19:15.080]  to a concert before the concert.
[19:15.180 --> 19:15.820]  We went to a bar.
[19:16.280 --> 19:19.900]  The bar had the game on and I told everyone about this.
[19:19.900 --> 19:23.160]  It was, we got to like the third quarter before we had to
[19:23.160 --> 19:25.940]  go and the third quarter felt like that's when they went on
[19:25.940 --> 19:29.460]  a tear and it was like, it was just a bar full of people
[19:29.460 --> 19:31.260]  going like, oh, you're poor friend.
[19:33.460 --> 19:34.940]  So what was the final?
[19:35.080 --> 19:36.540]  What was the final score then?
[19:36.720 --> 19:39.380]  I ended up eating 67 nuggets.
[19:40.360 --> 19:42.700]  And that was not enough to beat the Denver Nuggets.
[19:42.980 --> 19:45.040]  That was not... 106.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.320]  Yeah, the Nuggets scored 106.
[19:47.320 --> 19:50.020]  I almost outnuggeted the Mavericks who had 75.
[19:51.580 --> 19:53.840]  So... They had a legendarily bad game too.
[19:54.420 --> 19:54.840]  They did.
[19:55.060 --> 19:58.240]  What broke me, and I feel like this is just a fascinating
[19:58.240 --> 20:00.860]  because like as a fan you watch and it's heartbreaking
[20:00.860 --> 20:05.120]  sometimes, but you don't physically feel the toll of when
[20:05.120 --> 20:07.080]  a team goes on a run in the NBA.
[20:07.540 --> 20:12.260]  I had like a 14 nugget lead, 15 nugget lead going into
[20:12.260 --> 20:13.760]  the end of the half.
[20:14.240 --> 20:15.960]  Like at the end of the second quarter, there's like, I don't
[20:15.960 --> 20:17.480]  know, maybe seven minutes left in it.
[20:17.700 --> 20:21.860]  The Nuggets went on like a 14 point run where they scored
[20:21.860 --> 20:25.020]  just constantly without pause and it blew my lead.
[20:25.400 --> 20:27.720]  I only ended up having a one nugget advantage at the
[20:27.720 --> 20:30.360]  half. I think I had eaten like 55 and they'd scored
[20:30.360 --> 20:32.040]  54 points with something like that.
[20:32.380 --> 20:33.780]  That was demoralizing.
[20:33.960 --> 20:36.680]  That was really like the nail in the coffin of I had
[20:36.680 --> 20:40.400]  been eating so quickly with like no pause, just trying
[20:40.400 --> 20:41.000]  to get a lead.
[20:41.160 --> 20:44.160]  I just mentally needed a little bit of a gap because
[20:44.160 --> 20:45.300]  I knew I'd slow down.
[20:45.300 --> 20:48.380]  And the fact that they brought it to within one going
[20:48.380 --> 20:50.700]  into the half and I can't eat nuggets at that point.
[20:50.820 --> 20:53.180]  I just have to sit there and be like, well, I hope
[20:53.180 --> 20:55.600]  Dallas gets the ball or else I'm immediately behind
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.260]  them. Did you at that point, like during the halftime,
[20:58.300 --> 21:00.620]  did you do any kind of like stretching exercises or
[21:00.620 --> 21:04.060]  try to burn any calories or like, I don't know, move
[21:04.060 --> 21:05.420]  around to kind of adjust the food?
[21:05.780 --> 21:06.980]  I'm going to tell you what I did.
[21:07.180 --> 21:07.400]  Okay.
[21:07.620 --> 21:07.840]  Okay.
[21:07.960 --> 21:12.100]  This is just like a sign of how dead I was
[21:12.100 --> 21:15.440]  because I think I ate like 55 nuggets going into the
[21:15.440 --> 21:17.480]  half and I ended up with 67 nuggets.
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.200]  I was just broken by that point.
[21:19.280 --> 21:20.740]  Didn't eat a lot of nuggets third quarter.
[21:20.920 --> 21:23.200]  So the first half you ate 55, the second half you
[21:23.200 --> 21:23.680]  ate 12.
[21:24.240 --> 21:24.820]  Yeah, essentially.
[21:25.180 --> 21:25.940]  Yeah, something like that.
[21:27.360 --> 21:28.700]  I hit the half.
[21:29.100 --> 21:32.000]  I walked, went on a little walk, stood outside for
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.040]  a little bit during the break.
[21:33.320 --> 21:36.520]  Then I grabbed my boxes of nuggets, walked into the
[21:36.520 --> 21:38.100]  bathroom, just sat.
[21:38.240 --> 21:40.040]  I spent the end of the game in my bathtub eating
[21:40.040 --> 21:43.520]  the nuggets, just to moralize. Sitting in the dark,
[21:44.020 --> 21:47.160]  like two nugget boxes, eating when I can.
[21:48.120 --> 21:49.480]  Are you wearing clothes?
[21:49.640 --> 21:50.580]  Are you in the bathtub?
[21:51.020 --> 21:52.880]  Oh, no, I'm fully in the tub.
[21:53.020 --> 21:56.480]  I'm stretched out, trying to get as comfy as I can.
[21:57.200 --> 21:59.220]  Did you have your Xbox Live headset on?
[21:59.980 --> 22:01.260]  No, didn't have a headset.
[22:01.680 --> 22:02.480]  I was just sitting there.
[22:02.560 --> 22:06.060]  I was so sad and like, I think I tweeted at the end
[22:06.060 --> 22:06.820]  of the first quarter.
[22:06.820 --> 22:10.240]  I'm on, I'm on a pace to set an NBA scoring record
[22:10.240 --> 22:11.960]  because I eat like 26 nuggets.
[22:12.340 --> 22:14.020]  Because yeah, I think the Will Chamberlain scored
[22:14.020 --> 22:14.760]  a hundred points.
[22:14.860 --> 22:17.300]  I think it's the record for points scored at a game.
[22:17.360 --> 22:18.140]  I'm like, I'm at 26.
[22:18.900 --> 22:19.800]  I'm feeling great.
[22:19.880 --> 22:22.000]  Like I'm going to beat Will Chamberlain. And then it
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.960]  just collapsed that second quarter. Really demoralized.
[22:25.120 --> 22:27.400]  I'm worried that you went to the bath because the
[22:27.400 --> 22:28.960]  bath is typically your happy place.
[22:28.980 --> 22:31.380]  But I feel like recently it's been where you've had
[22:31.380 --> 22:35.020]  bad news of like the outskirts level being beat.
[22:35.020 --> 22:37.040]  And now it's where you go when you're sad with nugs.
[22:37.220 --> 22:39.880]  It was just I needed a place of comfort, Gavin.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.040]  I needed refuge.
[22:41.360 --> 22:44.660]  And so I grabbed my boxes and I walked in. I just
[22:44.660 --> 22:46.440]  slowly ate. I was just trying to get numbers.
[22:46.540 --> 22:48.500]  I conceded by the middle of the third quarter
[22:48.500 --> 22:51.200]  because I feel like it was just the worst quarter
[22:51.200 --> 22:53.900]  basketball I've seen any team ever play. It was Dallas's
[22:53.900 --> 22:55.260]  third quarter was horrendous.
[22:56.980 --> 22:57.780]  I failed.
[22:58.040 --> 23:00.540]  I honestly, I'm dumb though.
[23:00.680 --> 23:04.400]  Like I, by Sunday night, I was like, you know what?
[23:05.020 --> 23:06.760]  Maybe some strategic adjustments.
[23:07.160 --> 23:08.460]  I think I could do this.
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.500]  I love Monday.
[23:09.700 --> 23:10.200]  There is a game.
[23:10.340 --> 23:12.220]  I was like, do I do this again?
[23:12.480 --> 23:15.040]  Do I roll it back? I think Monday's too soon, but I
[23:15.040 --> 23:18.160]  would imagine you would have learned enough on
[23:18.160 --> 23:21.720]  the first attempt that you could, you know,
[23:22.980 --> 23:24.760]  do things a little differently the second time around.
[23:25.100 --> 23:27.340]  Assuming that this goes the same way as the burger
[23:27.340 --> 23:29.780]  confidence, attempt number two will be my best attempt
[23:29.780 --> 23:32.260]  and I would probably eat like 80 nuggets at that
[23:32.260 --> 23:33.660]  point, which probably still isn't enough.
[23:34.320 --> 23:36.140]  And then the third attempt would be the thing that
[23:36.140 --> 23:37.200]  gets me into nugget retirement.
[23:38.280 --> 23:42.720]  You just need to be really wise with your second
[23:42.720 --> 23:45.620]  attempt. Like, let's like, Jamal Murray is out right
[23:45.620 --> 23:47.980]  now. He tore an ACL last year, I think.
[23:48.200 --> 23:49.460]  So that's good for you.
[23:49.880 --> 23:52.540]  What you need to do is wait to like a load management
[23:52.540 --> 23:56.920]  night when they're resting the Joker and he's not in
[23:56.920 --> 24:00.520]  maybe MPJ is like got some calf stiffness or something.
[24:00.640 --> 24:02.260]  He's not playing and then you strike.
[24:02.360 --> 24:03.340]  That's a game you want to play.
[24:03.660 --> 24:05.780]  A game when the nuggets are down two or three of
[24:05.780 --> 24:08.240]  their best offensive players and they're just, you
[24:08.240 --> 24:09.440]  know, they're just a tread in water.
[24:10.540 --> 24:12.760]  What honestly the problem was, is it looked like
[24:12.760 --> 24:14.620]  the nuggets were going to score a million points
[24:14.620 --> 24:16.740]  and I would need to order more nuggets and I just
[24:16.740 --> 24:19.140]  didn't have it in me. Could not get more nuggets
[24:19.140 --> 24:21.200]  delivered. That was really a breaking point for me.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.340]  So Nick's right.
[24:23.380 --> 24:24.820]  It needs to be against a team with a really good
[24:24.820 --> 24:25.460]  defense as well.
[24:25.680 --> 24:26.500]  So I was upset.
[24:26.780 --> 24:27.980]  I feel like we should bring this up.
[24:28.040 --> 24:30.300]  I learned after the fact, or I guess before the
[24:30.300 --> 24:33.500]  run, that so we pushed the recording back because
[24:33.500 --> 24:37.680]  I was sick and I found out the next day that Geoff
[24:37.680 --> 24:40.000]  had this whole prank lined up and I put prank
[24:40.000 --> 24:40.860]  in quotations.
[24:41.640 --> 24:43.420]  I would have never been happier to get pranked
[24:43.420 --> 24:43.800]  by anybody.
[24:43.900 --> 24:45.960]  I know, I know, fantastic.
[24:46.700 --> 24:48.280]  So what we were going to do, and I don't think
[24:48.280 --> 24:50.040]  I had actually clued anybody in yet because I
[24:50.040 --> 24:51.620]  wanted everybody to be surprised when it happened
[24:52.100 --> 24:54.780]  and I was actually trying to find your address
[24:54.780 --> 24:56.820]  on my phone when I was reading the slack that
[24:56.820 --> 24:58.400]  we were going to postpone.
[24:58.400 --> 24:59.480]  So the timing was perfect.
[24:59.920 --> 25:02.180]  I was going to throughout the day.
[25:02.180 --> 25:05.720]  I was thinking like every 1 hour to 90 minutes.
[25:05.860 --> 25:09.040]  I wanted 20 fresh hot McDonald's chicken nuggets
[25:09.040 --> 25:11.280]  to show up on your front door and definitely
[25:11.280 --> 25:12.540]  during the podcast.
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.400]  I wanted to overwhelm you with nuggets leading
[25:16.400 --> 25:19.500]  up to the event because who can say no to nuggets
[25:19.500 --> 25:21.820]  first of all and B, I think just having your
[25:21.820 --> 25:24.580]  entire neighborhood would smell so intensely
[25:24.580 --> 25:26.520]  of nuggets that I thought psychologically it
[25:26.520 --> 25:28.720]  would completely and totally throw you off
[25:28.720 --> 25:29.080]  your game.
[25:29.080 --> 25:31.480]  Turns out I didn't need to but I really did
[25:31.480 --> 25:32.120]  want to do that.
[25:32.200 --> 25:32.800]  I'm really bummed.
[25:32.840 --> 25:33.540]  I didn't get to do it.
[25:33.840 --> 25:34.720]  I'm bummed too.
[25:34.880 --> 25:36.640]  I would have loved to have free nuggets for a
[25:36.640 --> 25:37.980]  day. That sounds fantastic.
[25:38.540 --> 25:40.500]  It was just like there's going to be an endless
[25:40.500 --> 25:43.100]  supply. Are you going to drown in nuggets the
[25:43.100 --> 25:44.940]  day before your nugget competition?
[25:45.420 --> 25:46.680]  I don't think that would have done anything
[25:46.680 --> 25:48.860]  either because the next day I finished the
[25:48.860 --> 25:50.660]  nuggets for lunch and like dinner.
[25:50.720 --> 25:52.480]  I just ate nuggets all the next day.
[25:52.640 --> 25:55.340]  I said that in the recording that I don't think
[25:55.340 --> 25:57.640]  we'll do anything with. If I was the first of
[25:57.640 --> 26:00.500]  anything for me, my first guy thing, I was,
[26:00.620 --> 26:03.360]  I'm the biggest chicken guy. Fucking love
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.720]  chicken ever since those little number one
[26:05.720 --> 26:08.380]  food. Huge chicken guy did the chicken dinner
[26:08.380 --> 26:10.980]  challenge. Love chicken. Could go a whole month
[26:10.980 --> 26:13.320]  just eating chicken. No problem. It's fantastic.
[26:13.460 --> 26:15.440]  Is there any chicken in those? Isn't it all
[26:15.440 --> 26:17.660]  chicken? I don't know. Is it really? Well, there's
[26:17.660 --> 26:19.400]  definitely, there's some chicken in there for
[26:19.400 --> 26:22.880]  sure. Do me a favor, rank the major meats
[26:23.440 --> 26:25.380]  from best to, from favorite to least favorite
[26:25.380 --> 26:28.540]  for me. Oh, it's chicken by like six miles and
[26:28.540 --> 26:30.400]  then whatever else, like I'm kind of indifferent
[26:30.400 --> 26:32.840]  to everything else. So you're indifferent to like
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.080]  beef and pork, like cow or? I guess like I would
[26:36.080 --> 26:39.220]  go beef two and then pork three, but chicken is
[26:39.220 --> 26:41.460]  so far ahead of both of them that it doesn't
[26:41.460 --> 26:44.420]  matter. Doesn't matter. I have a brief question
[26:44.420 --> 26:47.640]  about if you are to tackle this again, have
[26:47.640 --> 26:50.780]  you considered just doing it from inside a
[26:50.780 --> 26:53.540]  McDonald's? No. Can I tell you, can I tell you
[26:53.540 --> 26:55.580]  how I thought about salad creaming it though?
[26:55.760 --> 26:58.140]  Okay. I thought about ordering like popcorn
[26:58.140 --> 27:02.660]  chicken from like KFC. They're technically nugget.
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.940]  They're smaller. I could eat 200 of those. I just
[27:07.940 --> 27:10.560]  didn't want to deal with the blowback. I don't
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.160]  want to deal with that nugget blowback. You don't
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.380]  want nugget blowback. No. Nobody does. Well, I
[27:16.380 --> 27:20.780]  think, I think 62 is a, is a valiant, valiant
[27:20.780 --> 27:24.560]  effort. Or 67. 67, sorry. 67 is a valiant effort.
[27:25.180 --> 27:29.480]  And if you, if it didn't cause any long-term
[27:29.480 --> 27:31.540]  health effects, then I think it was a great
[27:31.540 --> 27:33.520]  experiment and I would love to see you try it
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.480]  again. Assuming that it doesn't kill you. Yeah,
[27:37.780 --> 27:40.080]  that's, I think realistically, maybe way down
[27:40.080 --> 27:42.120]  the road. I need to think about it more. There
[27:42.120 --> 27:44.360]  needs to be some strategic adjustments. Could
[27:44.360 --> 27:46.360]  I do it in a McDonald's? Does the McDonald's
[27:46.360 --> 27:48.500]  have Wi-Fi? That's my biggest question. Oh, definitely.
[27:48.500 --> 27:51.440]  Of course it will. I'm not sure. I also think,
[27:51.620 --> 27:53.260]  oh yeah, we should definitely shout that dude
[27:53.260 --> 27:55.800]  out. Thank you, Eric. I also think that next
[27:55.800 --> 27:58.280]  time we do it, we should do it on mic like
[27:58.280 --> 28:00.000]  this. We should just be listening in and have
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.760]  that conversation. Okay. I think we can provide
[28:01.760 --> 28:04.080]  moral support. Well, like a f*** face eats
[28:04.080 --> 28:06.220]  shit. Yeah, f*** face eats shit, right? So like
[28:06.220 --> 28:07.820]  when Andrew was doing it, we wouldn't, we
[28:07.820 --> 28:09.560]  wouldn't record the game audio or anything,
[28:09.720 --> 28:11.520]  but just like this, just the games on in the
[28:11.520 --> 28:13.060]  background and Andrew's just eating. He's
[28:13.060 --> 28:15.140]  probably not eating into the mic, but you
[28:15.140 --> 28:17.460]  know, we're, we're like, hey, one more, Andrew,
[28:17.460 --> 28:20.420]  you can do it. Chew harder. Yeah, I got it.
[28:20.680 --> 28:23.960]  Motivation will help. Yeah, I think so. I think
[28:23.960 --> 28:25.840]  so. I think that's the way to do it. I think that
[28:25.840 --> 28:27.880]  would be, that would be useful. I just didn't,
[28:27.960 --> 28:30.880]  yeah. There was also a guy on Reddit. His
[28:30.880 --> 28:33.980]  username is Chupaloop. He, I guess, lives in
[28:33.980 --> 28:36.600]  Denver and he is a Nuggets fan. He went to
[28:36.600 --> 28:39.500]  the game. He held up a giant eat the pencil
[28:39.500 --> 28:43.680]  Andrew sign with a big pencil on it. He, I,
[28:43.920 --> 28:46.160]  Emily and I looked for him all game. We never
[28:46.160 --> 28:48.180]  got to see him in this dance. It was so much
[28:48.180 --> 28:50.480]  fun. It was like a second game going on within
[28:50.480 --> 28:52.580]  the game. There was so much, there was so many
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.040]  nested ways to enjoy, to enjoy this Nuggets
[28:56.040 --> 28:58.580]  game. The one that I was having the most fun
[28:58.580 --> 29:01.480]  with was trying to find this sign. So Chupaloop,
[29:01.500 --> 29:04.220]  that was brilliant. He said that people around
[29:04.220 --> 29:06.600]  him were so confused and kept asking him what
[29:06.600 --> 29:08.500]  the hell the sign was about. And he was like,
[29:08.500 --> 29:10.300]  you have no idea how hard it is to explain
[29:10.300 --> 29:12.380]  this podcast to people. And I was like, oh, my
[29:12.380 --> 29:14.600]  entire career, buddy. Tell me about it. But yeah,
[29:14.600 --> 29:16.580]  it was a very, very, very funny, very funny
[29:16.580 --> 29:18.260]  thing to do. And it was super appreciated. So
[29:18.260 --> 29:20.640]  hello. I like that Andrew was eating Nuggets,
[29:20.780 --> 29:22.680]  but the sign said eat the pencil like the pencil
[29:22.680 --> 29:23.680]  still trumps all.
[29:27.040 --> 29:30.120]  Well, it's become like, it's become a like a
[29:30.120 --> 29:31.860]  phrase that doesn't mean anything anymore. It's
[29:31.860 --> 29:34.580]  like, hey, yeah, eat the pencil. You know, I
[29:34.580 --> 29:37.260]  mean, what? Hey, now, does it mean anything?
[29:37.420 --> 29:39.720]  I feel like, you know, I feel like it means
[29:39.720 --> 29:42.840]  hey now. Yeah, we're not going to do an old.
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.240]  We're not going to do an old Larry Sanders
[29:44.240 --> 29:46.380]  show bit. But okay, the point is, it doesn't
[29:46.380 --> 29:46.840]  mean anything.
[29:51.700 --> 29:55.680]  Using the Internet without ExpressVPN is like
[29:55.680 --> 29:57.960]  leaving your keys in your car while you run
[29:57.960 --> 30:00.620]  into a gas station for a snack. Most of the
[30:00.620 --> 30:02.660]  time you're going to come back and there will
[30:02.660 --> 30:04.640]  be a car there and you will recognize that car
[30:04.640 --> 30:06.940]  is yours. But every once in a while, like what
[30:06.940 --> 30:09.360]  happened to my friend Mike and his dad in high
[30:09.360 --> 30:11.940]  school when they went inside to buy cigarettes,
[30:12.040 --> 30:14.180]  you'll come out and that car is not there anymore.
[30:14.180 --> 30:17.520]  That's what people do to your Internet. Rarely,
[30:17.740 --> 30:20.040]  but it happens. Every time you connect to an
[30:20.040 --> 30:23.040]  unencrypted network, cafe, a hotel, an airport,
[30:23.680 --> 30:25.840]  any other place where you would connect to an
[30:25.840 --> 30:27.280]  unencrypted... you know where you connect to
[30:27.280 --> 30:28.660]  unencrypted networks. You don't need me to tell
[30:28.660 --> 30:31.900]  you. You don't need the list from me. Any hacker
[30:31.900 --> 30:33.880]  on that network can gain access to your personal
[30:33.880 --> 30:36.320]  data. And it doesn't take much technical knowledge
[30:36.320 --> 30:39.260]  to hack someone. Any smart 12-year-old could do
[30:39.260 --> 30:41.540]  it. Or maybe like a reasonably intelligent
[30:41.540 --> 30:44.760]  16-year-old or a kind of dumb 24-year-old. Your
[30:44.760 --> 30:47.100]  data is valuable. Hackers can make up to a
[30:47.100 --> 30:49.460]  thousand dollars per person just selling your
[30:49.460 --> 30:52.280]  boring, lame data on the dark web. That's why
[30:52.280 --> 30:54.100]  you want something like ExpressVPN. It creates
[30:54.100 --> 30:57.200]  a secure encrypted tunnel between your device
[30:57.200 --> 30:59.920]  and the Internet. Not big enough to drive... not
[30:59.920 --> 31:01.480]  one of those tunnels that you could drive like
[31:01.480 --> 31:04.640]  a Tesla through, but a secure Internet tunnel.
[31:04.980 --> 31:06.820]  And all of your data going in and out of that
[31:06.820 --> 31:08.760]  tunnel is going to be as safe and as encrypted
[31:08.760 --> 31:11.800]  as you and one of those Teslas zipping around
[31:11.800 --> 31:14.200]  under... is it Las Vegas, I think? Probably. It's
[31:14.200 --> 31:16.700]  also super secure. It would take a hacker with
[31:16.700 --> 31:19.040]  a supercomputer over a billion years to get
[31:19.040 --> 31:21.760]  past ExpressVPN's encryption. Those are their
[31:21.760 --> 31:24.400]  words, not mine. I haven't done the math on
[31:24.400 --> 31:26.880]  that. I haven't done the... I will... I'm gonna...
[31:26.880 --> 31:28.960]  they wrote it down, so I'm gonna assume they
[31:28.960 --> 31:31.160]  fact-checked it. So there you go. One billion
[31:31.160 --> 31:34.360]  years. Easy to use. You just fire up the app,
[31:34.440 --> 31:36.400]  click a button, and you get protected. And it
[31:36.400 --> 31:38.180]  works everywhere. Your phone, your laptop, your
[31:38.180 --> 31:40.640]  tablet, yada, yada, yada. That way you can stay
[31:40.640 --> 31:43.540]  secure wherever you go. I like ExpressVPN
[31:43.540 --> 31:46.260]  because I like to keep my... my collectible
[31:46.260 --> 31:48.560]  purchases a secret. You've heard me talk about
[31:48.560 --> 31:52.780]  the evil spoon and thimble cabal. I'm in sort
[31:52.780 --> 31:55.000]  of a constant battle of good and evil with
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.500]  them, right and wrong as it were. And I like
[31:57.500 --> 32:00.700]  to use ExpressVPN to keep my thimble and
[32:00.700 --> 32:04.340]  spoon purchases or not purchases safe. Secure

[32:18.960 --> 32:22.640]  correctly. Woo! This podcast is sponsored by
[32:22.640 --> 32:25.060]  BetterHelp Online Therapy. I think the
[32:25.060 --> 32:27.120]  best way to think about therapy is through
[32:27.120 --> 32:29.780]  an analogy. We get an oil change for our
[32:29.780 --> 32:31.760]  car to prevent a bigger issue down the
[32:31.760 --> 32:34.700]  road. I have had a piston seize up before
[32:34.700 --> 32:38.140]  and it is way more expensive to unfreeze
[32:38.140 --> 32:40.080]  an engine than it is to get the
[32:40.080 --> 32:43.140]  prescribed occasional oil change. Trust
[32:43.140 --> 32:45.080]  me, don't run out of oil in your car.
[32:45.340 --> 32:47.400]  Don't run out of oil in your brain. We
[32:47.400 --> 32:49.140]  see the doctor and we go to the gym to
[32:49.140 --> 32:50.740]  take care of our bodies to prevent
[32:50.740 --> 32:52.240]  injury and disease. We do these chores
[32:52.240 --> 32:53.480]  regularly. Well, some of us do them
[32:53.480 --> 32:56.280]  regularly to avoid a messy house. I do
[32:56.280 --> 32:58.100]  personally. I don't like mess. I don't like
[32:58.100 --> 33:00.400]  clutter in my house, in my brain, anywhere.
[33:00.540 --> 33:02.060]  And going to therapy is kind of like
[33:02.060 --> 33:03.520]  that. It's routine maintenance for your
[33:03.520 --> 33:06.200]  mental and emotional wellness and it
[33:06.200 --> 33:07.900]  helps prevent bigger issues down the
[33:07.900 --> 33:09.500]  road. And I can personally attest to
[33:09.500 --> 33:10.720]  this as someone who's been in therapy
[33:10.720 --> 33:13.720]  for more than a decade now. It also
[33:13.720 --> 33:14.860]  doesn't mean something's wrong with you.
[33:14.940 --> 33:16.240]  It just means that you're investing in
[33:16.240 --> 33:19.280]  yourself to keep yourself healthy. Better
[33:19.280 --> 33:21.320]  Help is customized online therapy that
[33:21.320 --> 33:23.900]  offers video, phone, and even live chat
[33:23.900 --> 33:25.420]  sessions with your therapist. So you
[33:25.420 --> 33:27.140]  don't have to see anyone on camera if
[33:27.140 --> 33:29.160]  you don't want to. Sometimes we're shy.
[33:29.660 --> 33:31.620]  It's much more affordable than in-person
[33:31.620 --> 33:33.400]  therapy and you can start communicating
[33:33.400 --> 33:35.980]  with your therapist in under 48 hours.
[33:36.500 --> 33:38.660]  Why invest in everything else in your
[33:38.660 --> 33:41.560]  life and not your mind? This podcast is

[33:59.060 --> 34:01.900]  Do we move on to the ball or do we move
[34:01.900 --> 34:05.580]  on to prototypes? Oh, I'm less excited
[34:07.820 --> 34:09.740]  about... Well, here's what I want to talk about.
[34:09.940 --> 34:13.760]  Okay. If you say prototypes, I will be furious
[34:13.760 --> 34:15.820]  with you. Because all we've talked about is
[34:15.820 --> 34:19.700]  prototypes. I want to talk about the Route
[34:19.700 --> 34:21.720]  44. It's not even on the list. I want you guys to
[34:21.720 --> 34:23.880]  watch. I want Gavin to send you guys the
[34:23.880 --> 34:27.640]  video of the Route 44. What is a Route 44?
[34:28.640 --> 34:31.840]  Okay, so we went on Sunday. We went to a
[34:31.840 --> 34:35.440]  park. Emily and Millie and I picked up
[34:35.440 --> 34:37.980]  Gavin. We went to a sports store. We bought
[34:37.980 --> 34:40.620]  a radar, an official radar gun. By the way,
[34:40.660 --> 34:42.680]  guys, congratulations. F*** Face owns a radar
[34:42.680 --> 34:45.420]  gun now. We can clock the speed of a lot of
[34:45.420 --> 34:48.060]  shit. I spent real money on it. It's f***ing
[34:48.060 --> 34:50.980]  nice. We're good. Fantastic. We got
[34:50.980 --> 34:53.300]  two baseball gloves now. F*** Face has...
[34:53.300 --> 34:54.600]  We're going to be able to field a team
[34:54.600 --> 34:56.560]  pretty soon. The only thing we're going to
[34:56.560 --> 34:58.580]  need is players. We're going to have all
[34:58.580 --> 35:01.140]  the equipment, right? Anyway, so after...
[35:01.140 --> 35:03.200]  We can talk about whether you guys want to
[35:03.200 --> 35:04.140]  talk about throwing the baseball or not.
[35:04.180 --> 35:05.380]  It's not important. We can do that if we
[35:05.380 --> 35:07.480]  need to, but I sense... I'm getting a sense
[35:07.480 --> 35:08.640]  that we probably don't want to. However,
[35:08.720 --> 35:10.560]  on the way home, we thought we would
[35:10.560 --> 35:12.640]  celebrate, you know, like when you
[35:13.740 --> 35:17.360]  go to the big baseball... Little League
[35:17.360 --> 35:18.720]  World Series or whatever it is in your
[35:18.720 --> 35:22.500]  town, and you win the game, and
[35:22.500 --> 35:24.300]  then everybody goes to, like, Dairy Queen
[35:24.300 --> 35:27.940]  to Blizzard's or whatever. Well, we went
[35:28.360 --> 35:30.320]  to... Our tradition on Sundays is to go
[35:30.320 --> 35:34.200]  to Sonic and get a Root 44. A Root 44 is
[35:34.200 --> 35:36.000]  a drink at Sonic that's a cherry
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.860]  lemonade, and it's got real cherries and
[35:37.860 --> 35:39.540]  real... or cherry limeade. It's got real
[35:39.540 --> 35:41.040]  cherries and real lime in it. It's called
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.180]  a Root 44 because it's 44 ounces. We get
[35:44.180 --> 35:47.700]  the diet, and then we just... just bathe in
[35:47.700 --> 35:49.800]  it, essentially. And Gavin had never heard
[35:49.800 --> 35:52.180]  of a diet Root 44, so we were like,
[35:52.240 --> 35:53.680]  let's get Root 44s on the way home to
[35:53.680 --> 35:54.960]  celebrate all the baseball throwing. And
[35:54.960 --> 35:56.680]  so we went through and we got it. He was...
[35:57.560 --> 35:59.920]  Well, I'll let him speak. He was over the
[35:59.920 --> 36:02.680]  moon with it. But, uh, but then he got out of
[36:02.680 --> 36:11.050]  the car. Do you want to explain what
[36:11.050 --> 36:14.270]  happened, Gavin? Oh, well, what happened,
[36:14.350 --> 36:16.330]  Geoff? Thanks for asking. I was carrying
[36:16.330 --> 36:20.850]  the camera at the tripod, quite big, so I
[36:20.850 --> 36:22.530]  had to just, like, have my hand over the
[36:22.530 --> 36:25.110]  top of the lid of the drink. But the
[36:25.110 --> 36:28.810]  drink is a big old American-sized... 44
[36:28.810 --> 36:32.350]  ounces. Yeah, so obviously it slipped.
[36:32.890 --> 36:35.730]  The lid came away. I ended up throwing
[36:35.730 --> 36:37.430]  it basically up the side of my house
[36:37.430 --> 36:40.570]  and in my lawn. And bright red sugar water.
[36:41.430 --> 36:43.750]  I'm not sure if you can tell from the video,
[36:44.290 --> 36:47.190]  but as soon as it happens, you can hear,
[36:47.390 --> 36:48.650]  if you turn the volume all the way up,
[36:48.890 --> 36:52.030]  you can hear a very muffled Geoff losing
[36:52.030 --> 36:54.890]  his shit laughing. And then he proceeds
[36:54.890 --> 36:57.870]  to roll the window down and cackle out
[36:57.870 --> 37:01.830]  into the street. I wonder if I should just...
[37:01.830 --> 37:03.510]  because we can't post the video, but I can
[37:03.930 --> 37:06.350]  play the audio. Yeah, play the audio. We
[37:06.350 --> 37:07.650]  can't post the video because it shows
[37:07.650 --> 37:09.750]  your house, but play the audio. Maybe
[37:09.750 --> 37:11.850]  Nick could just cut the audio in about
[37:20.780 --> 37:23.640]  now. It's the most honest laughter I've
[37:23.640 --> 37:27.520]  ever had. It was that, and then at one
[37:27.520 --> 37:29.880]  point, Emily, we were driving, and I
[37:29.880 --> 37:31.780]  pointed at a crazy lady on the side of the road
[37:31.780 --> 37:33.980]  to Emily, and she turned right as we hit
[37:33.980 --> 37:35.720]  the speed bump, so she hit a full speed,
[37:36.380 --> 37:38.280]  and Gavin's head hit the back of the
[37:38.280 --> 37:40.620]  car, the roof in the back of the car. He said he thought he
[37:40.620 --> 37:43.180]  swallowed his tongue. That was very funny, too.
[37:44.020 --> 37:46.480]  I've watched this 20 times at this point.
[37:46.680 --> 37:50.720]  This is... I don't think I've ever seen Geoff happier, to be honest.
[37:51.780 --> 37:54.480]  It might have been the best day of Geoff's life.
[37:54.480 --> 38:05.580]  Oh, man. It really is the hardest I've laughed in a long, long, long time.
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.180]  It was pure, pure joy. Did Millie see it?
[38:12.860 --> 38:15.820]  Shit. It doesn't matter what we do, Gav, or
[38:15.820 --> 38:18.440]  where we go, if we hang out, something
[38:18.440 --> 38:20.960]  that funny happens every time. I don't
[38:20.960 --> 38:23.880]  understand it. I love it. It's like a hundred
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.620]  percent reliability at this point. Yeah, you thought we were
[38:27.620 --> 38:29.480]  fine. You were on your way to your front
[38:29.480 --> 38:33.600]  door. You were like, no pickles here. I'm good. We're gonna make it right in the house.
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.200]  Oh my god. It's like I... fucking... somehow
[38:43.200 --> 38:45.540]  you've captured the essence of Don Zimmer
[38:45.540 --> 38:49.040]  eating shit by dropping a cup. Like, it's the same...
[38:53.680 --> 39:03.300]  There's so many layers! Did you... did the car stop Geoff to laugh at Gavin? To like, roll the window down? We were both still in his driveway.
[39:03.640 --> 39:10.380]  Oh, you're laughing. I started laughing, then I rolled my window down to point at him and laugh, and that's, I think, what you heard at the end.
[39:14.780 --> 39:27.380]  And to yell at him to get the footage off of his fucking camera. I just like that the crappy security mic kept you laughing inside a car. Like, that's how loud it was.
[39:30.140 --> 39:40.360]  Oh, man. It was pretty fucking funny. I like to imagine the cucumber lady was walking by in like, terrible throwing form. Worst throwing form at that door I've ever seen.
[39:41.560 --> 39:42.820]  These guys are weird.
[39:47.220 --> 39:52.860]  So, have you tried it, Gavin? Will you ever try it? Is this like, what is... you've never had it still, I'm guessing.
[39:53.060 --> 39:54.400]  No, I had some in the car.
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.420]  How was it? What's your review of a Diet Cherry Limeade Route 44?
[39:59.020 --> 40:08.480]  I mean, I don't typically go for like, giant vats of sugary trash, but it was pretty good. It was actually quite nice. I didn't have... well, I mean, I obviously didn't finish it.
[40:09.340 --> 40:11.920]  My lawn did, but it was pretty good.
[40:13.840 --> 40:15.920]  Eric said, you had a Route 6 or 7.
[40:22.780 --> 40:29.000]  I wasn't gonna bring this up, but you're not the only one who spilled a beverage in the last few days.
[40:30.720 --> 40:32.060]  I heard about it.
[40:32.060 --> 40:42.080]  I got some Burger King delivered, and I was walking up the stairs, and you know when you're planning ahead, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna plate this here, I'm gonna have this all nice, I'm gonna set it up all great.
[40:42.460 --> 40:48.420]  Tripped over the last stair, going up the stairs, fell, sodas flew out of my hands.
[40:48.900 --> 41:01.460]  I had like, two big drinks, slid across the floor, one of them ended up perfectly face down, like the lid was down on the floor, and I was like, that's the worst fucking angle that that could have landed.
[41:01.460 --> 41:09.860]  So I like, panicked, quickly grabbed it, it spilled all over the fucking wall, it's in bedroom, it's like your fucking smoothie, Geoff.
[41:09.940 --> 41:16.140]  It covered so many walls, I get to the kitchen, I put them all down, I realized that the fucking lids are taped.
[41:16.240 --> 41:20.380]  I forgot Burger King, an issue I had in the past, they taped the fucking things down.
[41:20.700 --> 41:27.700]  It was totally fine the way it was, it was my violent rip-up upwards is what fucked everything up and launched it.
[41:28.040 --> 41:29.860]  If I was just delicate, wouldn't have been a problem.
[41:31.020 --> 41:39.040]  Coated my walls, I'm still cleaning, that was on like Friday, I'm still cleaning soda stain from my wall, like aw shit, that's still there.
[41:39.260 --> 41:39.540]  Terrible.
[41:40.220 --> 41:41.220]  Man, that is funny.
[41:41.440 --> 41:47.580]  So I don't, I don't like, do we, I don't know if we necessarily want to get into it, I want to know which throw was less impressive.
[41:48.100 --> 41:51.060]  Gavin's drink throw or Geoff with a baseball? I really don't know.
[41:51.240 --> 41:54.040]  Oh, you know what else we should get into real fast on the way to that?
[41:55.100 --> 41:56.780]  Cause this came up on the drive over there.
[41:57.400 --> 41:57.560]  Okay.
[41:57.560 --> 42:06.520]  You know, I think it's pretty clear. I don't want to, I'm not trying to belabor a point, but everybody knows that I'm recently a pastrami guy.
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.500]  I actually had a pastrami sandwich for lunch today. It was phenomenal. About an hour ago.
[42:11.860 --> 42:17.200]  And as we know, I'm becoming a koozie guy as well. I'm actually going hard into koozies.
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.660]  And yeah, I've decided that 2022 is going to be like a real bit, it's going to be real heavy pastrami and koozie.
[42:25.860 --> 42:28.180]  The forecast calls for heavy pastrami and koozies.
[42:28.240 --> 42:28.420]  Yeah.
[42:28.940 --> 42:34.720]  For 2022 for sure. I've also been thinking about flirting with being an arm out the window when I drive kind of guy.
[42:34.920 --> 42:40.280]  Although we've had some mixed results over the last week or so with other obnoxious people with their windows down.
[42:41.100 --> 42:47.180]  While we were discussing this, Gavin has decided, and I wanted to bring this up so it doesn't get lost because I think it's a great idea.
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.600]  Gavin wants to move into the area of being a cereal on the front porch guy.
[42:52.960 --> 42:54.560]  Eating cereal on the front porch.
[42:54.920 --> 43:00.740]  Yeah, I saw, I was in the car with Geoff and I just saw a guy out on his front porch, sat on a nice little chair, just eating cereal.
[43:00.820 --> 43:05.580]  And I just thought, that just looks really nice. That just like, that looks like a really nice place to eat cereal.
[43:05.720 --> 43:07.460]  Maybe, maybe I should try that.
[43:07.760 --> 43:09.380]  Front porch more than a back porch?
[43:09.380 --> 43:15.300]  I think so. I think it's something about a front porch. It's like you're just watching the world in front of you.
[43:15.760 --> 43:18.880]  Is it the world in front of you? Like, I don't, I don't know.
[43:18.900 --> 43:21.880]  I mean, that guy saw us. We were on our way to go throw baseballs.
[43:22.120 --> 43:24.600]  Yeah, that's the highlight of a cereal eat.
[43:25.340 --> 43:26.760]  Yeah, he had a front row seat.
[43:27.180 --> 43:34.980]  The best part of that day was you taking us to every baseball field in Austin and we get there and they're all in use.
[43:34.980 --> 43:40.420]  So we end up doing it next to a baseball field, just on some grass. We could have done it anywhere.
[43:40.700 --> 43:47.400]  As far as regulation, uh, as far as regulation baseball diamonds go, this was not a regular, it was pretty f*** face regulation for sure.
[43:48.060 --> 43:52.760]  Uh, yeah, I mean, I don't really know what you guys, I don't know that there's much of a story there.
[43:53.260 --> 43:59.340]  We, we all piled into the car. I told you the funny part about hitting the speed bump. I told you the thing about the cereal.
[43:59.700 --> 44:00.940]  Well, did we all give our guesses?
[44:00.940 --> 44:04.120]  Uh, I reinforced the pastrami.
[44:04.580 --> 44:10.260]  Uh, then we went, we threw the ball and then Gavin spilled the drink. I really feel like we got, we covered most of it.
[44:10.460 --> 44:12.800]  I, I, I feel like...
[44:12.800 --> 44:13.700]  What was your prediction?
[44:14.100 --> 44:19.900]  I'm trying to remember if I made an official prediction before, I would guess that Geoff throws 57.
[44:20.660 --> 44:22.620]  I'm going to say we learned a lot about a lot of things.
[44:22.960 --> 44:25.080]  My guess, Andrew, was 58.
[44:25.780 --> 44:26.500]  58, 57.
[44:27.520 --> 44:29.180]  Wow, really? Your price is right.
[44:29.240 --> 44:29.920]  Eric, what was yours?
[44:29.920 --> 44:32.080]  Eric, Eric and Nick, you wanna?
[44:32.420 --> 44:37.740]  I didn't think you were breaking, like, for your first throw, for like the first time out there, I didn't think you were breaking like 62.
[44:39.340 --> 44:41.860]  62, Nick says around 60.
[44:42.760 --> 44:49.120]  I feel like you guys have, I feel like you guys have inflated all these numbers over time. These feel a little higher than last time I remember them, but okay.
[44:49.760 --> 44:55.080]  I'm just, I'm curious, did, uh, did Geoff throw one ball? How many balls did Geoff throw for this?
[44:55.140 --> 44:55.760]  I would say eight or nine.
[44:56.060 --> 44:56.840]  We had two balls.
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.320]  Eight or nine, okay, and do you remember which ball was the fastest?
[45:02.460 --> 45:04.300]  And we should say which number was it of the nine.
[45:04.300 --> 45:04.680]  Which number was it of the nine?
[45:04.880 --> 45:06.440]  I hit the fastest number twice.
[45:06.480 --> 45:06.680]  Consistent.
[45:06.680 --> 45:07.960]  I was never able to break it.
[45:08.860 --> 45:12.900]  Okay, and what was, what was that attempt on? Was that like two and eight?
[45:13.080 --> 45:15.480]  Second and last attempt, I think.
[45:16.060 --> 45:16.380]  Okay.
[45:17.000 --> 45:17.260]  Wow.
[45:17.260 --> 45:18.560]  There'll be a video out soon.
[45:18.580 --> 45:21.280]  I would say I probably, probably threw it at least 12 times.
[45:21.320 --> 45:23.700]  Threw it at least 12 times? So second and 12th.
[45:25.640 --> 45:27.720]  I would be confident if I were you.
[45:27.860 --> 45:29.360]  The fact that shows you got a little stamina.
[45:29.640 --> 45:31.020]  Second throw and last throw?
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.220]  I gotta say, uh, assuming I didn't hit, like, assuming this continues, right?
[45:35.260 --> 45:38.640]  Like, obviously, if I threw the ball 80 miles an hour, we're done.
[45:39.160 --> 45:40.440]  Boring segment, it's over.
[45:40.580 --> 45:42.100]  I did what I said I was gonna do.
[45:42.420 --> 45:47.000]  Bit of a letdown, if I'm being honest with you, because we thought that it would be fun to watch me build my way up.
[45:47.580 --> 45:50.340]  Uh, so if I threw it to 80, then that sucks, we're done.
[45:50.340 --> 45:54.520]  But if I didn't, then we get to watch the three-month journey of me building it up.
[45:54.620 --> 45:57.560]  And I'm happy to report that if that's the case, my arm feels fine.
[45:57.760 --> 45:59.080]  I didn't have any ill effects at all.
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.260]  Now, I don't know what this number is.
[46:01.420 --> 46:04.800]  I read, I don't remember, I apologize, not giving proper credit to the person.
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.720]  I saw somebody suggest that we do a nugget versus speed-off.
[46:09.240 --> 46:11.940]  That I have to eat more nuggets than whatever your pitch count is.
[46:12.080 --> 46:14.980]  But we don't, I'm not sure what the number is for that.
[46:15.320 --> 46:17.400]  What did Geoff throw? Do we talk about it now?
[46:17.520 --> 46:18.560]  Is this the reveal?
[46:19.000 --> 46:19.760]  Geoff, what did you throw?
[46:19.760 --> 46:24.680]  Well, do we want to, we'll say Millie, we'll see, everybody threw.
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.320]  Emily's fastest was 16, I think, 16 miles an hour.
[46:32.120 --> 46:35.400]  Uh, Millie was able to throw it 26 miles an hour.
[46:35.740 --> 46:38.040]  Gavin threw, he got a recorded time, threw it a few times.
[46:38.120 --> 46:40.080]  Do you feel comfortable telling your time?
[46:40.100 --> 46:43.720]  Well, I should say that I was very nervous about throwing the ball because the last time I threw a baseball,
[46:43.880 --> 46:46.440]  I hit Millie in the face, straight in her face.
[46:47.380 --> 46:50.840]  Do you want to send them the photo of what happened when you threw the ball this time?
[46:51.180 --> 46:53.260]  Okay, let me, uh, let me put this in the Discord.
[46:53.560 --> 46:55.240]  Send that fucking photo.
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.600]  Uh, yeah. I'll tell you what's happened is, Gavin's magnetically attracted to being an asshole to my daughter.
[47:00.880 --> 47:04.560]  Now, is accuracy a consideration at all, or was it just pure speed?
[47:04.580 --> 47:06.020]  Um, no, accuracy didn't matter.
[47:06.400 --> 47:09.640]  And that actually made it a little difficult, because there was nothing to throw to.
[47:10.360 --> 47:12.880]  So if you zoom in, you can see...
[47:12.880 --> 47:14.820]  Uh, so Gavin's supposed to be...
[47:14.820 --> 47:17.680]  Alright, in this photo, you see Emily, my girlfriend, taking a photo.
[47:17.860 --> 47:22.140]  You see Millie hauling ass because there's a ball going straight for her head.
[47:22.580 --> 47:27.740]  To the left, on the extreme left, you'll see a tripod with a camera on it.
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.320]  Gavin is supposed to be throwing left of that camera.
[47:30.320 --> 47:33.440]  I was meant to be winging that camera. I wanted to go right past the lights.
[47:33.580 --> 47:36.460]  It went straight towards Millie's head.
[47:36.580 --> 47:38.860]  She had to run out of the way immediately.
[47:39.160 --> 47:41.800]  That is her running in abject fear.
[47:43.560 --> 47:47.120]  Thank God for her teenage reflexes.
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.060]  She's like a magnet. I wasn't even facing her.
[47:51.560 --> 47:52.600]  I couldn't believe it.
[47:53.160 --> 47:54.260]  She was, I think...
[47:55.120 --> 47:57.840]  She was not happy, and I think slightly more worried afterwards.
[47:58.120 --> 48:04.080]  But because of that sort of slip release, I failed to throw it very fast.
[48:04.300 --> 48:06.880]  My number was 43.
[48:07.380 --> 48:11.180]  I would argue that, turns out, 43 is pretty fast.
[48:11.180 --> 48:14.720]  I mean, not so fast Millie couldn't dodge it, thank Christ.
[48:15.480 --> 48:18.100]  But 43 is a fast ball, I gotta say.
[48:18.260 --> 48:19.260]  I gotta say it's pretty fast.
[48:20.200 --> 48:25.000]  Yeah, Eric can back that up. 43, it's more heat than I had anticipated.
[48:25.100 --> 48:27.820]  Eric said, yeah, it is about half as fast as 80.
[48:29.080 --> 48:31.340]  Yeah, he's right. That's technically correct.
[48:31.540 --> 48:32.920]  So Geoff, what was your number?
[48:33.220 --> 48:35.220]  Well, I'll tell you what. What did you throw it at?
[48:35.440 --> 48:35.840]  43.
[48:36.200 --> 48:38.840]  Alright, well, I'll say this. I beat 43.
[48:38.840 --> 48:40.620]  I threw it better than that.
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.920]  I threw it at 46, coming off of a myriad of lifetime of injuries.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.600]  And no preparation.
[48:49.180 --> 48:55.060]  I managed to still throw it faster than a 33-year-old British man.
[48:55.820 --> 48:56.840]  So I feel pretty good about that.
[48:57.540 --> 48:58.360]  That's a good hey.
[48:58.760 --> 49:01.400]  I'm gonna be honest with you. I didn't hit 80.
[49:02.300 --> 49:03.720]  I thought I would.
[49:04.640 --> 49:06.800]  I thought I had like a 50-50 shot.
[49:07.560 --> 49:09.400]  Didn't quite get there. Fell a little short.
[49:09.520 --> 49:10.840]  But I see room for improvement.
[49:11.140 --> 49:12.980]  And I haven't started yet.
[49:13.300 --> 49:14.760]  Obviously because we haven't had this conversation.
[49:15.620 --> 49:17.180]  So I'll begin the training now.
[49:17.580 --> 49:20.400]  I guess we'll say 90 days from November 2nd.
[49:20.600 --> 49:21.480]  You know, we'll try again.
[49:22.660 --> 49:25.440]  And what I was even thinking is, would it be fun?
[49:25.520 --> 49:27.120]  Kind of like how they did on Top Gear.
[49:27.180 --> 49:28.240]  We could have like a leaderboard.
[49:28.520 --> 49:31.680]  We could have friends of F*** Face throw the ball and see how fast they can do.
[49:31.760 --> 49:34.660]  We can see who can have the best time in like the F*** Face family.
[49:34.840 --> 49:36.160]  I think it'd be a lot of fun. We'll get you in there.
[49:37.520 --> 49:39.780]  Andrew, we'll get Nick, we'll get Eric.
[49:40.400 --> 49:41.900]  It'll be a grand old time.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.140]  We'll have a little leaderboard. It'll be great.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.680]  So are we still aiming for you to get 80?
[49:45.820 --> 49:47.020]  Is that still the goal?
[49:47.800 --> 49:49.780]  I'd like to get there. I'd like to get there.
[49:49.800 --> 49:51.100]  I got a little bit of room.
[49:51.560 --> 49:52.880]  I got a little bit of room to improve.
[49:53.220 --> 49:55.860]  I think you could hit 60.
[49:56.580 --> 49:57.340]  With some training.
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.100]  I would like to agree with you.
[49:59.500 --> 50:01.500]  I'm a little off of 60.
[50:02.680 --> 50:04.420]  My top speed, which I hit twice.
[50:04.420 --> 50:06.160]  So there was some consistency there.
[50:06.500 --> 50:08.900]  Was 49 miles an hour.
[50:09.000 --> 50:09.860]  You're so f***ed.
[50:09.980 --> 50:11.080]  You're so f***ed.
[50:15.300 --> 50:18.640]  Turns out 49 is really fast.
[50:18.860 --> 50:20.400]  And really hard.
[50:21.400 --> 50:23.580]  That was the earliest one.
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.200]  I ran over to the radar gun that Emily was holding.
[50:27.880 --> 50:30.880]  And before she even put it out, I just burst out laughing.
[50:31.080 --> 50:34.120]  Because it said 42 on it.
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.480]  And Geoff was just like, alright, I'll throw it again.
[50:39.160 --> 50:40.680]  Not demoralized at all.
[50:41.620 --> 50:43.440]  But never breached 50.
[50:43.920 --> 50:44.740]  All day.
[50:45.140 --> 50:46.080]  Tried so hard.
[50:47.540 --> 50:48.100]  I couldn't do it.
[50:48.340 --> 50:49.540]  Definitely gonna break 50.
[50:50.240 --> 50:51.100]  I'd like to break 60.
[50:51.100 --> 50:54.560]  Was there a feeling of like 60 was in the air before Geoff threw?
[50:54.660 --> 50:55.400]  Was there anticipation?
[50:55.760 --> 50:56.940]  What was that moment like?
[50:56.940 --> 50:58.800]  There was a moment.
[50:59.460 --> 51:01.940]  There was a moment when Emily was...
[51:02.580 --> 51:03.580]  We were testing out the gun.
[51:03.760 --> 51:05.200]  And she was like, just throw it that way a little bit.
[51:05.240 --> 51:06.780]  And we just tossed it back and forth.
[51:07.180 --> 51:09.400]  And she clocked that at like 30 miles an hour.
[51:09.540 --> 51:11.160]  And we were like, oh, that was nothing.
[51:11.340 --> 51:12.440]  We weren't even throwing it hard.
[51:12.760 --> 51:13.260]  Easy peasy.
[51:13.500 --> 51:15.820]  So we were all like, well, we're gonna throw this thing at 70 miles an hour.
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.620]  If we throw it hard.
[51:17.060 --> 51:22.340]  And then it turns out the difference between the effort to require to throw 30 and 49 is tremendous.
[51:23.260 --> 51:25.180]  So, anyway.
[51:25.520 --> 51:26.600]  Definitely gonna hit 50.
[51:27.140 --> 51:28.520]  Think I can probably hit 60.
[51:28.760 --> 51:29.920]  80 we're gonna shoot for.
[51:30.760 --> 51:32.820]  Not positive I'm gonna get there in 90 days.
[51:32.900 --> 51:33.960]  It might take a little bit longer.
[51:34.120 --> 51:35.300]  But that's what we determined.
[51:35.660 --> 51:37.020]  So that's what we're gonna go for.
[51:37.340 --> 51:41.260]  Although I imagine if I don't hit 80, I'll probably just continue the journey.
[51:41.260 --> 51:43.400]  You won't hit 60 if given a year.
[51:44.660 --> 51:45.800]  I was gonna say.
[51:45.960 --> 51:47.500]  Let's get through the 90 days first.
[51:47.800 --> 51:49.120]  Wait, you said... hang on.
[51:49.180 --> 51:49.760]  Okay, hang on.
[51:49.760 --> 51:54.640]  You say you can hit 80 if given a little bit longer?
[51:55.160 --> 51:55.680]  How much?
[51:56.300 --> 51:59.540]  What do you need to play AAA ball?
[52:00.040 --> 52:01.300]  Well, we're gonna see.
[52:01.720 --> 52:02.460]  We're gonna see.
[52:02.800 --> 52:03.760]  We got 90 days.
[52:03.900 --> 52:06.400]  We'll see, A, how good is my training regimen?
[52:06.620 --> 52:07.580]  Does it work?
[52:07.860 --> 52:08.840]  Did I pick the right one?
[52:08.900 --> 52:10.260]  Have I invested in the right people?
[52:10.580 --> 52:11.780]  Hopefully the answer is yes.
[52:11.840 --> 52:13.380]  Hopefully I make progress.
[52:13.480 --> 52:14.980]  Another big thing you gotta worry about in my age.
[52:14.980 --> 52:17.720]  Am I gonna suffer any training setbacks due to injuries?
[52:18.080 --> 52:19.800]  A lot of people get hurt in the weight room.
[52:20.100 --> 52:21.860]  Doing workouts, doing training.
[52:21.960 --> 52:22.980]  So I gotta watch that.
[52:23.360 --> 52:24.500]  It's a delicate balance.
[52:24.620 --> 52:27.300]  Are you gonna hit the weight room?
[52:27.380 --> 52:29.880]  Assuming all conditions are met.
[52:29.940 --> 52:30.560]  I'm gonna have to.
[52:30.560 --> 52:32.320]  I'm gonna have to train five days a week to throw this ball.
[52:32.820 --> 52:33.500]  80 miles an hour.
[52:36.040 --> 52:36.840]  I mean...
[52:36.840 --> 52:38.040]  Duh, obviously.
[52:38.280 --> 52:39.400]  Professional baseball players train.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.500]  I feel like 80 is dead.
[52:41.500 --> 52:44.740]  I would bet anything you can't throw higher than my nugget number.
[52:44.980 --> 52:47.320]  I bet anything that you can't throw a 68.
[52:47.600 --> 52:48.320]  I don't...
[52:48.320 --> 52:49.880]  I think we should go with the nuggets.
[52:50.180 --> 52:50.900]  And I don't think...
[52:50.900 --> 52:52.080]  I think you'll out-nugget the ball.
[52:52.240 --> 52:53.920]  I think I can be...
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.620]  I think I can hit 80. I don't know that I will in 90 days.
[52:57.060 --> 52:58.380]  But I think given enough time, I can.
[52:58.800 --> 53:01.060]  However, I definitely...
[53:01.060 --> 53:03.120]  The more time that passes, the harder it gets for you.
[53:03.300 --> 53:04.280]  You're not getting younger.
[53:05.060 --> 53:07.260]  I'm training, dude. Age is a state of mind.
[53:07.460 --> 53:08.140]  I don't think...
[53:08.140 --> 53:08.800]  Age is a state of mind.
[53:08.940 --> 53:10.320]  I'm already faster than Gavin.
[53:10.660 --> 53:13.680]  To be honest, I don't even think I can move my arm 80 miles an hour.
[53:13.720 --> 53:14.180]  Like, empty.
[53:14.540 --> 53:18.120]  I would love to know what speed that drink was flying out of your hand at.
[53:18.260 --> 53:19.680]  That looked like a solid 20.
[53:24.020 --> 53:26.180]  I even started standing in the way.
[53:26.580 --> 53:26.980]  So I was like,
[53:27.020 --> 53:28.980]  Geoff, maybe if you aim at me, it'll go faster.
[53:29.540 --> 53:30.220]  Didn't really help.
[53:30.320 --> 53:31.220]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[53:31.780 --> 53:34.820]  We're gonna check back in on January 31st,
[53:34.820 --> 53:35.880]  and I'll throw the ball again,
[53:36.020 --> 53:39.080]  and we'll see if I show any kind of improvement or not.
[53:39.180 --> 53:40.280]  One of two things is gonna happen.
[53:40.360 --> 53:42.640]  I'm gonna take this very seriously, and I'm gonna train hard.
[53:42.840 --> 53:44.300]  I have a trunk full of gear
[53:44.700 --> 53:47.340]  that leads me to believe that things are headed that way.
[53:47.660 --> 53:49.460]  However, I also have 46 years
[53:49.460 --> 53:51.360]  of intimate knowledge
[53:51.360 --> 53:52.800]  of myself, and so I think
[53:52.800 --> 53:54.780]  there's a really good chance I forget about it
[53:54.780 --> 53:56.840]  tomorrow, and I don't think about it again
[53:56.840 --> 53:58.840]  until we talk about it on January 31st.
[53:58.920 --> 54:00.520]  So one of those two things is gonna happen.
[54:00.600 --> 54:02.820]  I'm not sure which, but it's either...
[54:02.820 --> 54:04.960]  slower, or way faster next time.
[54:05.660 --> 54:07.000]  You were just talking about having
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.880]  a leaderboard. Surely you'd be reminded
[54:08.880 --> 54:10.340]  if you played that game.
[54:10.760 --> 54:11.820]  We can already make the leaderboard.
[54:12.580 --> 54:14.060]  People just gotta throw the ball.
[54:14.320 --> 54:16.620]  That was ball, so now we got
[54:16.620 --> 54:18.800]  prototypes, then chocolate. Is that right?
[54:19.020 --> 54:20.540]  We do. I feel like
[54:20.540 --> 54:22.820]  we should push the chocolate.
[54:23.260 --> 54:24.860]  And what did you say? Five minutes
[54:24.860 --> 54:25.940]  to eat the whole chocolate?
[54:26.400 --> 54:28.760]  I don't think I'll need that much time.
[54:28.920 --> 54:30.920]  My one question, you never replied.
[54:31.600 --> 54:33.020]  Does the timer start
[54:33.020 --> 54:34.880]  when the chocolate hits my lips,
[54:35.040 --> 54:37.180]  or is it when I peel open the thing?
[54:37.420 --> 54:38.120]  No, when it hits your lips.
[54:38.600 --> 54:39.720]  Opening it isn't...
[54:39.720 --> 54:42.500]  Can I prep the chocolate
[54:42.500 --> 54:44.340]  for that?
[54:44.600 --> 54:46.760]  If by prepping you mean snapping it and putting it
[54:46.760 --> 54:47.820]  in your mouth, then yeah.
[54:48.680 --> 54:50.620]  I'm gonna start prepping the chocolate then.
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.960]  While you're doing that, I think we should
[54:52.960 --> 54:54.960]  push prototypes, because I still got photos
[54:54.960 --> 54:55.580]  to edit and stuff.
[54:56.260 --> 54:57.820]  Although I could get it together if we needed to.
[54:57.820 --> 54:59.320]  But if you want to do prototypes...
[54:59.780 --> 55:00.400]  What's wrong, Andrew?
[55:00.620 --> 55:03.040]  There's a lot more chocolate.
[55:04.020 --> 55:05.980]  I think we've got a solid
[55:05.980 --> 55:07.820]  episode here. We'll cover prototypes in
[55:07.820 --> 55:09.040]  two days when we talk again.
[55:10.500 --> 55:11.900]  But I have a question for
[55:11.900 --> 55:13.820]  you guys. This is a merch-related
[55:13.820 --> 55:15.500]  question, not to circle back to merch, but I
[55:15.500 --> 55:17.500]  want to check the temperature on something.
[55:18.040 --> 55:20.060]  A lot of people have requested
[55:20.060 --> 55:21.760]  and suggested that we make
[55:21.760 --> 55:23.120]  baseball jerseys.
[55:23.600 --> 55:25.940]  I have resisted that because I would never...
[55:25.940 --> 55:28.060]  It just seems hokey to me a little bit.
[55:28.320 --> 55:29.880]  And as it's correctly
[55:29.880 --> 55:32.040]  pointed out over and over again, we are not a baseball podcast.
[55:32.280 --> 55:32.940]  We are a fruit
[55:34.200 --> 55:36.040]  podcast, if or anything, these days.
[55:36.500 --> 55:37.600]  So, you know. However,
[55:39.600 --> 55:40.040]  what if
[55:40.040 --> 55:41.060]  we made...
[55:41.060 --> 55:44.260]  Do you guys want to make a baseball jersey? And if you did,
[55:44.540 --> 55:45.860]  what would you think about this idea? Because I think
[55:45.860 --> 55:47.840]  the thing that people like about f***face merch
[55:47.840 --> 55:49.980]  is that it's unique and it's...
[55:49.980 --> 55:51.840]  Well, it's been dipped in
[55:51.840 --> 55:53.560]  my misery a lot of the time.
[55:53.560 --> 55:55.360]  And I think that's a selling point, too.
[55:55.860 --> 55:57.540]  But exclusivity is also
[55:57.540 --> 55:59.180]  helpful. What if we made...
[55:59.180 --> 56:01.040]  You know how when you're on a Little League team,
[56:01.360 --> 56:03.560]  you get your jersey with your number
[56:03.560 --> 56:05.500]  and your name on the back of it, and you get
[56:05.500 --> 56:07.820]  to pick your number, right? And then...
[56:07.820 --> 56:09.600]  So what if... You don't get to pick your
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.420]  name, but what if we just made 99
[56:11.420 --> 56:13.180]  number 00-99
[56:13.900 --> 56:15.380]  jerseys, and that's all that there are?
[56:15.620 --> 56:17.140]  And depending on which size you
[56:17.500 --> 56:19.500]  order is which number you get, and that's just what it is.
[56:19.520 --> 56:21.680]  And there's only 99, and so every
[56:21.680 --> 56:23.340]  jersey is a one-of-a-kind.
[56:23.600 --> 56:25.520]  I like it. Maybe the...
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.740]  I wonder if that's feasible. I wonder if we could
[56:27.740 --> 56:29.700]  do that. Maybe the sponsor of the jersey should be
[56:29.700 --> 56:30.940]  Nasso. Nasso.
[56:31.220 --> 56:33.880]  Oh, Nasso. We don't want to lose
[56:33.880 --> 56:34.960]  Nasso. Get Nasso on there.
[56:35.560 --> 56:37.760]  Maybe get the Smashing Sportsman on there
[56:37.760 --> 56:40.040]  somewhere, if that's possible.
[56:40.360 --> 56:41.180]  We gotta get the audience
[56:41.940 --> 56:43.360]  supporting the Smashing Sportsman.
[56:43.740 --> 56:45.620]  Good point. Uniform should
[56:45.620 --> 56:47.180]  definitely be there. We're gonna have to acquire him.
[56:47.780 --> 56:49.680]  Should definitely be a sponsor. Uniform's gotta be
[56:49.680 --> 56:50.860]  in there. Thank Me Later, maybe?
[56:51.440 --> 56:53.000]  We got a lot of ads. Ooh, Thank Me Later.
[56:54.200 --> 56:55.360]  Too Spicy Icy.
[56:55.540 --> 56:57.560]  We got the Beef Bracelet. There's a lot of...
[56:57.560 --> 56:59.200]  Yeah. Dude, this is a...
[56:59.200 --> 57:00.400]  This is gonna look like a NASCAR.
[57:01.240 --> 57:03.480]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[57:05.700 --> 57:06.100]  Ooooooh.
[57:06.600 --> 57:07.220]  I... Hmm.
[57:07.300 --> 57:08.620]  How do I want to approach this?
[57:09.580 --> 57:10.760]  Is really... Orally.
[57:11.620 --> 57:13.200]  Okay, so we're officially pushing
[57:13.200 --> 57:15.380]  prototypes to next episode, and we'll just
[57:15.380 --> 57:17.320]  end on Chuck. I mean, we're like
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.520]  an hour in, and... Yeah, we're
[57:19.520 --> 57:21.300]  50... Okay, I'm gonna start
[57:21.300 --> 57:23.180]  at 55 minutes of my recording,
[57:23.320 --> 57:25.280]  which isn't... Why? I can start the timer for you.
[57:25.500 --> 57:26.680]  It's just visually. Okay.
[57:27.860 --> 57:28.320]  Okay.
[57:31.120 --> 57:32.040]  3... 2...
[57:32.880 --> 57:33.340]  1...
[57:33.340 --> 57:34.680]  Go, go, go. Ooh.
[57:34.940 --> 57:36.580]  Can I have water?
[57:37.380 --> 57:39.400]  He just goes for it. Not even
[57:39.400 --> 57:40.660]  finished talking about all the rules.
[57:41.200 --> 57:43.140]  I would say, water at the end.
[57:43.540 --> 57:44.800]  No! No!
[57:44.800 --> 57:46.100]  It's so...
[57:46.740 --> 57:48.600]  How much did you put in... How much did you
[57:48.600 --> 57:49.960]  first bite? Like, how many squares?
[57:50.580 --> 57:51.600]  Half the bar!
[57:51.920 --> 57:52.540]  Ha ha ha!
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.720]  So he put half of a bar of 100...
[57:56.720 --> 57:57.860]  This is 100% chocolate?
[57:59.160 --> 58:00.480]  100% cocoa
[58:00.480 --> 58:02.720]  content chocolate. Let me ask you a question.
[58:02.860 --> 58:03.980]  I was thinking about this the other day.
[58:04.200 --> 58:06.800]  While he's suffering. If a chocolate
[58:06.800 --> 58:08.560]  bar is 100%, like he's eating
[58:08.560 --> 58:09.900]  pure chocolate right now, right?
[58:10.340 --> 58:12.400]  What is it... If he's eating
[58:12.400 --> 58:14.460]  the 70, what's the other 30%?
[58:15.300 --> 58:16.000]  No, this is fine.
[58:16.300 --> 58:18.160]  What do you mean it's fine? It's fine.
[58:18.680 --> 58:19.680]  It's just like dirt.
[58:19.960 --> 58:21.980]  Ha ha ha!
[58:22.700 --> 58:24.680]  Is it really not fainting? I had
[58:24.680 --> 58:25.940]  one line
[58:25.940 --> 58:28.520]  of squares and it was one of the worst things
[58:28.520 --> 58:30.460]  I ever ate. I'm miserable right now
[58:30.460 --> 58:32.560]  but this is totally doable. Wow! You're handling
[58:32.560 --> 58:34.020]  it so... I'm so surprised.
[58:34.400 --> 58:35.460]  It's just like dirt.
[58:36.500 --> 58:38.080]  I'm just eating sand right now.
[58:38.320 --> 58:39.960]  So you're at 1 minute 20.
[58:39.960 --> 58:41.280]  Is this like chocolate at all?
[58:41.720 --> 58:43.740]  I would not recognize this as chocolate.
[58:43.740 --> 58:44.700]  Ha ha ha!
[58:48.560 --> 58:50.220]  It's like no sugar. Apparently that
[58:50.220 --> 58:52.440]  30% of other ingredients is
[58:52.440 --> 58:54.000]  the part that makes people like chocolate.
[58:54.180 --> 58:56.300]  Yeah, it turns out all the stuff that's not cocoa beans
[58:56.300 --> 58:58.140]  is the good stuff.
[58:58.220 --> 58:59.220]  Turns out that when you're
[59:00.060 --> 59:02.260]  eating a chocolate bar, you're really eating the stuff
[59:02.260 --> 59:03.440]  that binds the chocolate.
[59:04.080 --> 59:06.060]  Are you slowing down?
[59:06.180 --> 59:06.600]  What did you say?
[59:10.340 --> 59:11.340]  What did you say?
[59:11.460 --> 59:12.560]  Did you say something about Lord Fauntleroy?
[59:13.060 --> 59:13.500]  What was that?
[59:14.560 --> 59:16.180]  I'm working through it.
[59:16.240 --> 59:17.500]  Alright, you're halfway through.
[59:17.900 --> 59:18.920]  Oh no, you've got 5 minutes.
[59:19.200 --> 59:21.900]  You're at 2 minutes 10.
[59:22.780 --> 59:24.480]  Mhm. Can I drink
[59:24.480 --> 59:25.960]  with this or no? Can you what?
[59:26.160 --> 59:28.420]  Can I drink? Am I allowed to have a drink or no?
[59:28.440 --> 59:30.100]  Yeah, at the end. But not during.
[59:30.460 --> 59:32.080]  I don't think so. Yeah, Nick says no.
[59:32.300 --> 59:32.880]  Fuck you, Nick.
[59:34.240 --> 59:34.800]  Wow.
[59:35.480 --> 59:36.040]  Lovingly.
[59:37.740 --> 59:38.800]  What percentage
[59:38.800 --> 59:40.780]  through the bar do you think you are right now?
[59:40.980 --> 59:42.220]  It's hard to answer.
[59:42.480 --> 59:43.880]  Because there's so much paste in your mouth?
[59:44.280 --> 59:45.460]  It's just paste.
[59:51.040 --> 59:52.500]  How much of the bar
[59:52.500 --> 59:54.220]  has not entered into your mouth yet?
[59:54.880 --> 59:55.320]  3 minutes.
[59:59.300 --> 59:59.860]  7...
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.120]  8...
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.380]  Like 11 squares maybe?
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.200]  Why aren't you eating?
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.960]  How many squares did you start with? A lot.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.160]  Like over half the bar. I got like maybe
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.480]  a quarter of the bar left. I don't think you have time
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.400]  to be chatting about it. I think you should be chewing.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.360]  Well then stop fucking asking me questions!
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.660]  He's got a point there.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.600]  You have to get the rest in.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.200]  I'm doing it!
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:27.550]  Well let me ask you a question, Gavin.
[01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.450]  Do you think he's gonna make it?
[01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.850]  It sounds like he might.
[01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:32.970]  He's got a minute 20 left.
[01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.830]  I don't know what it proved.
[01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.290]  It sounds super gross
[01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:39.110]  and it sounds like it's exactly as
[01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:40.350]  gross as you said it was.
[01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:43.030]  Well immediately it's not floored him like it did me.
[01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.710]  It's not like ruined his day.
[01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.970]  Well I think the thing that we're gonna learn
[01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.450]  here is that Andrew swims in gross
[01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:50.970]  in ways
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.790]  that other people aren't comfortable.
[01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:54.870]  Maybe. At this point Andrew
[01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.930]  is it all in your mouth? Uh huh.
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:59.010]  So there's nothing
[01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.010]  left in the container?
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:00.930]  Mm-mm.
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:03.070]  Wow, I'm so impressed.
[01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.070]  I'm so impressed.
[01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:06.990]  I'm gonna have time.
[01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:09.670]  What'd he say? About time.
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:11.490]  He wants to know how much time he's got.
[01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:12.790]  70 seconds left.
[01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:15.810]  He's not gonna make it.
[01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.210]  He's not gonna make it.
[01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.910]  Swallow it!
[01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:20.990]  He can't do it!
[01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:22.970]  You got it!
[01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:25.210]  You can do it!
[01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:26.130]  15 seconds!
[01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:26.770]  No!
[01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.670]  No!
[01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:35.610]  He's drowning!
[01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.150]  And time!
[01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:42.410]  5 minutes!
[01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.790]  More time!
[01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.430]  More time!
[01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.110]  More time!
[01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:50.610]  Alright, well can you do it within 7?
[01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:52.810]  Oh definitely!
[01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.350]  It just sounds like you're storing it
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.830]  in your face, but you're not working to get it down.
[01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:00.890]  I'm trying!
[01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:05.590]  I could listen to this all day long.
[01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:09.910]  Oh man.
[01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:12.590]  Oh so bad.
[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:15.570]  It can't be that bad.
[01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:17.090]  I'm excited for his review
[01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:17.790]  after he's done.
[01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:20.350]  If I...
[01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:22.490]  What's the issue with, like,
[01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:24.270]  what's holding you up?
[01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:25.670]  Swallowing it.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.760]  I feel like if we give you to 7 minutes,
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.500]  that counts because we asked you probably
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.920]  2 minutes worth of questions.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.020]  You know how in the...
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.360]  You know how like in...
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.480]  You know how in like NASA merchandise,
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.260]  it has like the logo,
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.720]  it'll have like a little astronaut and then it'll have the sky
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.620]  and it'll have stars?
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.200]  Should...
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.560]  When we make the NASA logo, should it look like that
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.840]  but it's little nuggets? It's like little L-shaped nuggets?
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.700]  Yeah, I think that's great.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.640]  20 seconds till 7 minutes, Andrew.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.860]  How has he got more in his mouth now
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.620]  than when he started?
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.200]  7 minutes!
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.920]  It sounds like it's just too pink!
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.840]  It's just too pink!
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.900]  It sounds so much worse than at the beginning!
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:47.620]  It sounds like it's getting wetter, maybe.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.980]  Maybe the saliva...
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.680]  Maybe the...
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.440]  No! No!
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440]  No! You can't do that!
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.560]  I will fucking spit chocolate everywhere!
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.660]  He's gonna come up with 10 minutes with chocolate in his mouth!
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:18.520]  I would love to see somebody try to subtitle that.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.200]  Oh God, it's all over my lips!
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.740]  You sound like you've got a headcrab on you!
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.480]  It's like it's getting thicker in my mouth!
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.180]  Almost 9 minutes since you started.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.880]  I'm making progress.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.540]  Oh wow, that sounded pretty clear actually.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.240]  How close are you to finishing, would you say?
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.600]  Pretty close.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.800]  So you're setting a world record right now.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.760]  So when you say it done,
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.380]  that'll be the official world record, just like
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.660]  the current fastest
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.260]  baseball throw in the world is
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.180]  49 miles an hour.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.700]  I have the world record at the moment.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.200]  You will have the world record on this.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.380]  I'm so close.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.800]  We should have a Guinness Book of Records, but it's just
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.980]  records. Done. Did it.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.100]  9 and a half minutes!
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.540]  9.30 on the dot? Yep.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:21.820]  I think I could hit 7 easily, I learned a few things in the middle of that.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.020]  What did you learn?
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.840]  The only way to ingest it is to
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.640]  treat it like I'm swallowing pills.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:28.940]  Like it's medication.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:30.680]  That became my approach.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.560]  You were just swallowing full lumps?
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.500]  Yeah, well no, like it was
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.820]  I chewed it to the point where it was just like a thick
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.680]  paste, a chocolate-y
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.440]  liquid, and that's what
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.600]  it was like mud. It was like trying to eat
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.680]  mud, and you just have to swallow
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.380]  like you would never chew it to
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.680]  a texture that is great.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.100]  Did it taste good?
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.700]  It tastes awful, but
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.300]  it's consistently bad.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.700]  It's consistently what?
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.740]  Bad. Like once you
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.160]  it doesn't climb.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.660]  The real problem would have been if you would have made me
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.580]  laugh really hard, I would have shot
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.620]  chocolate fucking everywhere and there's a note coming
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.180]  back from that.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.200]  Yeah, you'd need a new room. I would.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.740]  So has it gone up or down then, your confidence, after that?
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.180]  I think I'm a dark chocolate guy.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.620]  We'll have to
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.780]  update the kitchen magnets.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.720]  I gotta be honest, I don't want
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.980]  to get involved in this
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.480]  chocolate game you guys have going on.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.680]  I'm up to my eyeballs in baseball throws.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.620]  But I feel like I could eat
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.680]  it faster than that. I feel like it wouldn't be as hard as you're making it.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.420]  I'd love to see you try, I think next week.
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.600]  Next Thursday. I think you could beat
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.740]  him, Geoff. I don't trust you saying that,
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.180]  but I do think you could beat him. Do we have a chocolate off?
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.940]  I'll do it again. I think I could do better.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.460]  I definitely don't trust Gavin's
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:44.980]  motivations,
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.520]  and I think he's a,
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.840]  at least when it comes to me, usually a liar.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.180]  So, uh, but I do
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.920]  honestly, personally think I could do
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.160]  better than that. I think we should have a chocolate
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.140]  off on Thursday. I'm all for this.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.060]  You know what's better than a chocolate off? What?
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.040]  A chocolate trio. We should get
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.840]  Gavin another one and we should all do a three way.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.880]  Oh no, there's no way.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.800]  I need to, I'm still
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.920]  working, I don't want to ruin my, I'm still working on
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.900]  my palate. We'll see if we can eat an
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.860]  entire chocolate bar before Gavin gets through one
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.180]  square.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.780]  Nick's got a great point.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.620]  Low calorie too.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.800]  Tie in antioxidants maybe, I don't know.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.800]  I did start on, I started on
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.960]  70% by the way. You did?
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.700]  Honestly, I had a piece of
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.100]  70% too, and it gave me more chocolate confidence.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.880]  I'm like 30% more of this, can't be
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.840]  bad. Yeah, 70's great. I wonder
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.980]  which percentage it gets
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.500]  tremendously awful.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.880]  See, I don't like any of it,
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.920]  so it's equally bad, I think
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.980]  is my advantage. Then how are you gonna be a
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.560]  dark chocolate guy? Uh, it's like
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.940]  before I never even touch it, I feel
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.800]  like I just had the most potent dark chocolate
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.320]  you could have and I was okay with it.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.400]  I know what you mean, like I
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.740]  at early on, I tasted
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.480]  alcohol and I was like, this is fucking disgusting.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.840]  But I definitely can tell I'm gonna be an
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.820]  alcohol guy, and then I was. So maybe
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.660]  it's like that. Yeah. Could be.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.800]  Yeah. Alright, that was great.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.000]  I feel like hopefully the comment
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.740]  leavers will be satisfied. I feel like we
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.580]  closed a lot of loose ends today.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.020]  Gavin and I threw
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.500]  a baseball. It was pretty
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.980]  badass. Everybody was pretty impressed with the
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.040]  results. Andrew, you were
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.140]  a demon on that chocolate. That was fantastic
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:23.700]  to watch.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.920]  Oh, we had the whole nugget saga.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.080]  Who could forget that? What a ride
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.380]  that was. And
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.100]  the real fun was doing it together
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.660]  knowing that the audience was
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.900]  right there alongside us. So we
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.640]  really appreciate that. And
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.840]  maybe tune in next week when we'll do it again. And
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.780]  if you don't, hopefully nothing
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.620]  bad happened to you in your personal life
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.840]  that kept you away from the podcast. Hopefully you were just
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.800]  forgetful or lazy or whatever, but
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.900]  maybe get your shit together next time and
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.740]  have some brand loyalty. Alright.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:53.620]  Peace out.
