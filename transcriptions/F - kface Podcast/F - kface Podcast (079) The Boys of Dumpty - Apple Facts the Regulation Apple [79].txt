[00:35.420 --> 00:39.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of this podcast called F*** Face.
[00:39.900 --> 00:42.520]  Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, uh...
[00:42.520 --> 00:44.560]  How's everybody been in the last 8 seconds?
[00:45.220 --> 00:45.520]  Great.
[00:45.540 --> 00:47.200]  That might be the shortest time...
[00:47.200 --> 00:48.600]  Oh, shit, my audio.
[00:48.860 --> 00:51.060]  It might be the shortest time between recordings we've ever had.
[00:51.980 --> 00:56.020]  Oh, if I start a new file, it starts repeating myself in my own ears and I got confused.
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.360]  I don't know how it happened.
[00:57.720 --> 00:59.340]  I don't know how... Episode 79, by the way.
[00:59.500 --> 01:04.100]  I don't know how it happened, but I ended... We just ended the podcast and I felt great.
[01:04.220 --> 01:07.260]  I was like on top. I was like, oh, I got my energy back. I had some Gatorade. I'm feeling good.
[01:07.260 --> 01:10.720]  And then the second we started this podcast, it went away.
[01:11.320 --> 01:13.840]  Really? Why don't we do a different day then?
[01:14.140 --> 01:17.560]  No, no, no. We gotta get through it. Next week's Thanksgiving. We gotta do this.
[01:17.700 --> 01:21.120]  It's Thanksgiving for one day and then Black Friday. There's still a whole week before that.
[01:21.780 --> 01:24.140]  Okay, you're making yourself available. Is that what you're saying?
[01:24.600 --> 01:25.500]  Next week, I'm available.
[01:27.180 --> 01:28.180]  Is Nick and Eric?
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.740]  I can... Yeah, I'm good. You guys wanna do Tuesday?
[01:31.900 --> 01:35.000]  I mean, we're already recording, so I don't know why we would stop.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.400]  Here's what we should do. Here's what we should do. Let's record...
[01:38.400 --> 01:41.600]  What do you mean?
[01:41.740 --> 01:43.700]  Let's record next week as well.
[01:44.340 --> 01:47.360]  Okay. Well, I assume we were gonna record next week anyway.
[01:47.700 --> 01:49.360]  I assumed we weren't because it was a holiday week.
[01:49.460 --> 01:51.340]  I also assumed we weren't.
[01:51.420 --> 01:51.860]  Oh, okay.
[01:52.260 --> 01:56.480]  But you know what the problem is, Eric? You and Nick and I are the Americans.
[01:57.580 --> 01:59.380]  Thanksgiving means shit to these two.
[01:59.740 --> 02:01.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I still barely know what it is.
[02:01.940 --> 02:03.260]  It's our second biggest holiday.
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.400]  It's... I celebrate it. I'll have a turkey going on Thursday.
[02:07.880 --> 02:09.060]  The mashed potatoes and everything.
[02:09.520 --> 02:10.120]  That's awesome. You got to.
[02:10.420 --> 02:11.240]  You got to. You have to.
[02:11.780 --> 02:14.600]  If you watch sports, you have to because I got sick of like...
[02:14.600 --> 02:18.220]  Well, also just on social media, you're seeing turkey all day and you feel left out.
[02:18.540 --> 02:19.460]  You need to have it.
[02:19.900 --> 02:24.380]  Even if I didn't work for an American company, I would be celebrating this because it's just...
[02:24.380 --> 02:28.100]  You can't... There's only so much turkey you can have shoved in your face without having it.
[02:29.280 --> 02:30.380]  It ruins my day.
[02:31.420 --> 02:36.360]  Lack of cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving? No mashed potatoes? It's like it's fucking ruined. There's no replacement.
[02:36.700 --> 02:39.260]  Do you get it in that can and it like sloughs out?
[02:39.600 --> 02:42.720]  No! No, no, no, no. I'm making my own cranberry sauce.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.980]  You don't make your own cranberry... You got to make your own.
[02:46.020 --> 02:47.900]  What, you actually like buy cranberries?
[02:48.320 --> 02:51.520]  You buy cranberries, you put them in the pan, they start popping.
[02:51.720 --> 02:54.240]  Oh, it's the time, Gavin. You put them in a glass of water, you eat them in the bar.
[02:54.660 --> 02:59.480]  When you have your five-star meal in my bathtub, I'm going to get a candle for you.
[02:59.480 --> 03:02.260]  I'll make you some fresh cranberry sauce. It's going to be a great time.
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.580]  You put on your favorite... You put on your favorite Dolphins fight song.
[03:07.520 --> 03:10.340]  Or maybe it's the Chicago Bears if you want to support your rookie.
[03:10.940 --> 03:14.440]  And you just pop... Oh, somebody needs to. The coach isn't helping.
[03:14.660 --> 03:17.720]  Someone needs to support Justin Fields. He has no offensive line.
[03:17.860 --> 03:20.800]  I got a thing about that, too, that's talking about stuff not being evergreen.
[03:21.660 --> 03:27.840]  First off, can I just at the top hit a couple of notes just so I can feel like I made some progress on my stuff?
[03:27.840 --> 03:29.920]  Alright, number one. Here's the first thing I wrote down.
[03:30.240 --> 03:34.100]  Let's all record our farts and then see if we can tell them apart.
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.700]  Oh, I can't do them.
[03:36.240 --> 03:36.880]  You can't fart?
[03:37.300 --> 03:42.860]  Well, they're just really quiet. I'd have to have a microphone in my colon to get any sound, I think.
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.880]  Well, I'm not opposed to that. If we need to do it.
[03:48.680 --> 03:54.800]  I'm about to do a whole colon thing tomorrow. I can pick up some pointers from the doctor about inserting cameras and shit.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.940]  I think it would be fun. Everybody farts. We label it with some random name so we don't know who it is.
[04:02.180 --> 04:04.280]  And then we mix it up and then we give it to Nick or somebody.
[04:04.580 --> 04:06.160]  Well, I would like Nick to be a part of it, actually.
[04:06.220 --> 04:08.720]  So we give it to somebody who's outside of the episode.
[04:09.300 --> 04:13.980]  And then we listen to it. We all see if we can get it right.
[04:14.080 --> 04:14.840]  I think it could be fun.
[04:15.860 --> 04:19.460]  Gavin, if you can't fart, in itself you'll be easy to figure out.
[04:19.540 --> 04:20.920]  Because you'll be the one that goes...
[04:21.580 --> 04:24.120]  Maybe I'll eat two tins of beans and see what I can work up.
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.020]  The Fiber One Bars? I'm telling ya. Get some Fiber One Bars going. You'll get a fire.
[04:30.720 --> 04:31.620]  You'll be going.
[04:31.780 --> 04:35.260]  Eric said good name. Gavin, you didn't get credit for that. I might have missed it. What was the name?
[04:35.820 --> 04:36.620]  Wheel of Fartune.
[04:37.080 --> 04:37.800]  That's a great name.
[04:37.940 --> 04:39.020]  Oh, that is a great name.
[04:39.020 --> 04:39.840]  Wheel of Fartune. That is a great name.
[04:40.360 --> 04:40.820]  Wheel of Fartune.
[04:40.860 --> 04:46.320]  That's a fantastic name. I was trying to conjure a fart during the Cosmic Crisp review the entire time as a protest movement.
[04:46.400 --> 04:47.040]  I just couldn't.
[04:47.380 --> 04:50.180]  You were going to fart in the middle of us eating apples? You're an animal.
[04:50.180 --> 04:55.960]  No, I was trying really hard. It was the only thing I could do. It was the only weapon I had. I couldn't build it in time.
[04:56.080 --> 04:58.160]  The bomb was not ready. I should have went in prepared.
[04:59.380 --> 05:03.140]  Oh, you know what I think we should do while the Cosmic Crisp apples still exist at RT?
[05:03.380 --> 05:03.620]  Yeah.
[05:03.960 --> 05:06.360]  I think, and then Andrew, obviously...
[05:06.360 --> 05:08.420]  Actually, maybe we should wait until you're able to get one.
[05:08.660 --> 05:17.460]  But the day you get a Cosmic Crisp, I think all of us, Nick and Eric included, should put a Cosmic Crisp apple in our fridge in the back.
[05:17.460 --> 05:21.860]  And then we all agree to pull it out 365 days later and eat it.
[05:22.140 --> 05:22.260]  Yep.
[05:22.760 --> 05:30.160]  I think we gotta test the longevity of the apple. It's one of their major bragging points. It's one of their major selling points about that apple.
[05:30.360 --> 05:34.060]  What about when this winter all of my power goes off for four days? What do I do then?
[05:34.700 --> 05:37.640]  You'll be fine because it's 20 degrees outside when your power goes off.
[05:38.220 --> 05:40.940]  The apples will be... Oh, take it out of the fridge and put it outside. It'll be fine.
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.680]  Wait a second. You're the guy that was giving me shit about refrigerating my apples?
[05:45.680 --> 05:49.340]  Did you just ask me what would happen if you were not able to refrigerate an apple?
[05:49.480 --> 05:50.440]  Is that what just happened?
[05:50.700 --> 05:52.200]  I'm saying if I'm like 10 months in...
[05:52.200 --> 05:53.060]  Is that what just happened?
[05:53.360 --> 05:55.080]  Am I like fridge locked to it?
[05:55.280 --> 06:00.420]  Oh, so at what point does it become acceptable to like refrigerate an apple, according to you?
[06:01.140 --> 06:05.960]  What? No, my only point was I don't buy enough apples to need to store them that long.
[06:06.240 --> 06:06.400]  Yeah.
[06:06.500 --> 06:07.880]  I'll just eat them as they're out.
[06:08.220 --> 06:10.800]  And it feels weird to eat a cold apple versus a room temperature apple.
[06:10.840 --> 06:10.940]  Yeah.
[06:10.940 --> 06:13.060]  I agree. But the selling point of...
[06:14.460 --> 06:18.280]  Irrespective of Gavin and whatever we agree or disagree with in him,
[06:18.480 --> 06:22.680]  the major selling point of the Cosmic Crisp is that it lasts up to a year in a fridge, so I want to see that.
[06:22.880 --> 06:23.880]  I think we need to test it.
[06:24.320 --> 06:24.700]  I agree.
[06:25.340 --> 06:26.120]  No, I completely agree.
[06:26.220 --> 06:26.860]  I think it's a great idea.
[06:27.240 --> 06:31.900]  So the day you get your hand on a Cosmic Crisp, let us know.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.720]  And we'll figure it out on this end.
[06:33.740 --> 06:40.120]  I just really want to find out if the 8 rating stands for an apple you've eaten.
[06:40.120 --> 06:41.380]  Yeah, I do too.
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.740]  We'll find out.
[06:43.740 --> 06:45.560]  I'm... let me see if I can...
[06:45.560 --> 06:46.460]  I'll check right now.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.920]  I don't think I'll be able to order one, but there's a website...
[06:49.920 --> 06:50.440]  It doesn't matter.
[06:50.620 --> 06:51.280]  Anyway, continue.
[06:51.440 --> 06:52.640]  Sorry, what other notes do you have, Geoff?
[06:53.140 --> 06:54.980]  Man, I got so much, I realized.
[06:55.420 --> 06:59.940]  We had a comment leaver, a regulation listener named Ben Davis,
[07:00.980 --> 07:01.860]  who's really awesome.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.080]  He's very communicative on social.
[07:05.080 --> 07:10.040]  He made a really cool action figure of me in a port-a-potty
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.820]  that I want to show you guys at some point.
[07:12.200 --> 07:13.560]  I should have talked about last episode.
[07:13.620 --> 07:13.980]  It's amazing.
[07:14.400 --> 07:15.280]  You've seen a little bit of it.
[07:15.340 --> 07:15.840]  That's really cool.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.240]  I also wanted to show you guys...
[07:18.240 --> 07:25.600]  I got a really, really cool baseball card out of a random-ass drop the other day.
[07:26.240 --> 07:30.180]  And I was so blown away by it that I wanted to show you guys immediately,
[07:30.300 --> 07:32.160]  but I figured it would be better to do it on camera.
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.700]  This is a baseball card I legit pulled
[07:34.700 --> 07:36.440]  from a pack I bought at a baseball card shop the other day.
[07:36.480 --> 07:37.320]  I didn't know this card existed.
[07:37.840 --> 07:38.540]  It's a cool... oh!
[07:39.180 --> 07:40.240]  The Boys of Zimmer!
[07:40.540 --> 07:41.800]  The Boys of Zimmer!
[07:42.820 --> 07:45.860]  It's Ryan Sandberg, Andre Dawson, and Greg Maddox.
[07:45.900 --> 07:49.780]  These would have been Chicago Cubs in the... probably 1990, 1991.
[07:50.920 --> 07:53.800]  And I was so blown away.
[07:53.980 --> 07:55.460]  I thought it would be fun for us.
[07:55.520 --> 08:00.220]  We need to remake this baseball card with us and sell it as a poster.
[08:01.060 --> 08:01.860]  The Boys of Zimmer.
[08:01.960 --> 08:02.960]  Which one would you be?
[08:04.300 --> 08:05.480]  Geoff, you'd have to be in the middle.
[08:05.620 --> 08:06.120]  I think I would be...
[08:06.120 --> 08:08.900]  I would like to be Andre Dawson, if I'm being honest with you.
[08:09.580 --> 08:12.800]  All those guys are Hall of Famers, but Andre Dawson's the coolest motherfucker.
[08:13.380 --> 08:14.180]  And he's got a cool pose.
[08:14.600 --> 08:16.300]  I want a bat. I want to hold the bat.
[08:16.380 --> 08:17.500]  Alright, Andrew's the bat.
[08:17.520 --> 08:17.740]  I'm just taking the bat.
[08:17.900 --> 08:18.780]  Andrew's Ryan Sandberg.
[08:19.180 --> 08:21.280]  I'm Greg Maddox, and I'm just holding my own hand.
[08:22.080 --> 08:23.160]  It looks like you're holding your dick, dude.
[08:28.320 --> 08:30.620]  What you're doing is you're covering your phone.
[08:30.620 --> 08:35.400]  You have just received a text from Geoff, and you're affectionately looking at how great the text was.
[08:35.900 --> 08:36.620]  That's what I'm doing.
[08:38.120 --> 08:39.680]  I'm really excited to respond.
[08:40.300 --> 08:43.340]  Anyway, just a little thing, but fucking very, very cool.
[08:43.780 --> 08:45.400]  I thought that I would share that with you guys.
[08:45.960 --> 08:51.600]  Don Zimmer continues to make his presence known in our lives weekly.
[08:52.180 --> 08:53.860]  Despite the fact that the man is dead.
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.160]  Did he code you all three of them?
[08:55.480 --> 08:56.860]  I guess he must have, yeah.
[08:57.800 --> 08:59.180]  What? What a weird...
[08:59.940 --> 09:01.720]  What? Did he coach all three?
[09:01.720 --> 09:03.800]  No, he coached two of them, and one of them never met him.
[09:04.120 --> 09:05.480]  It's the boys' Zimmer card.
[09:05.620 --> 09:06.920]  What are you fucking talking about?
[09:07.180 --> 09:09.040]  Maybe the dumbest question I've ever heard.
[09:09.100 --> 09:11.560]  Two of them were his players, the other was just a Zimmer fan.
[09:11.900 --> 09:16.420]  No, but it might be like they're an organization, and one person knew of the other.
[09:16.800 --> 09:19.920]  Oh yeah, the baseball team, the Zimmers, everyone's favorite.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.340]  These are the boys.
[09:21.500 --> 09:23.080]  Do you think these are his sons, Gavin?
[09:23.260 --> 09:25.240]  Like, what are you asking?
[09:25.240 --> 09:27.180]  Did they play for him?
[09:28.140 --> 09:29.000]  What did you say?
[09:29.840 --> 09:31.460]  Was it play or even know?
[09:31.720 --> 09:32.540]  Did they know him?
[09:33.300 --> 09:34.840]  Had they met Don Zimmer?
[09:35.440 --> 09:37.240]  Fucking boys' Zimmer card?
[09:38.100 --> 09:41.960]  So you're putting that up there, top three dumbest questions on the Facebook post, do you think?
[09:42.440 --> 09:47.000]  I'm not saying overall, I'm saying it's one of the dumbest questions I've ever heard you ask.
[09:47.320 --> 09:49.220]  I'm just surprised his face isn't on there.
[09:49.460 --> 09:50.500]  That's mainly it.
[09:51.560 --> 09:53.220]  He's not a boy of himself.
[09:53.640 --> 09:55.040]  Why would he be on the card?
[09:55.040 --> 09:56.720]  These are the boys of Zimmer.
[09:57.160 --> 09:58.100]  Boys of me.
[09:59.800 --> 10:00.880]  They're not his sons.
[10:01.860 --> 10:02.420]  What the fuck?
[10:03.060 --> 10:06.900]  You want fucking Zimmer's head in the top right, just looking down on them?
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.760]  Like, what do you want? Where's Zimmer in this card?
[10:08.780 --> 10:13.560]  It's just expecting a lot. It's expecting every single person who sees that to know who Don Zimmer is.
[10:14.060 --> 10:14.460]  Sure.
[10:15.440 --> 10:17.440]  But, like, what are you...
[10:17.440 --> 10:18.880]  I don't... I'm so...
[10:18.880 --> 10:21.700]  I don't know how to reply to that. I've got so many issues with that statement.
[10:21.700 --> 10:22.480]  I don't know where to begin.
[10:22.660 --> 10:24.240]  You're buying baseball cards.
[10:24.500 --> 10:27.520]  In the world of baseball, Don Zimmer is so famous
[10:27.520 --> 10:30.320]  that simply putting the boys of Zimmer on a card
[10:30.320 --> 10:32.660]  instantly every baseball fan on earth
[10:32.660 --> 10:33.940]  knows who they're talking about.
[10:34.220 --> 10:36.280]  I don't think there's a single person, Gavin,
[10:36.480 --> 10:38.660]  who knows who the guys on the card are
[10:38.660 --> 10:40.560]  who would then not know who Zimmer is.
[10:40.860 --> 10:41.620]  It's like putting...
[10:41.620 --> 10:43.460]  It's like a baseball card...
[10:46.510 --> 10:48.270]  It's like a baseball card that just said
[10:48.270 --> 10:49.750]  the boys of Baker
[10:49.750 --> 10:51.170]  and it was a picture of three hands.
[10:51.170 --> 10:53.730]  If it was Dusty Baker, that would make sense.
[10:57.250 --> 10:57.910]  Would it?
[10:58.750 --> 11:00.930]  Well, if it was three Houston Astros,
[11:01.190 --> 11:01.630]  I guess.
[11:02.630 --> 11:04.530]  Okay, but they were called...
[11:04.530 --> 11:05.870]  It was a whole...
[11:05.870 --> 11:07.490]  I think you're taking the boy thing
[11:07.490 --> 11:09.130]  is where it's really thrown you, Gavin.
[11:09.230 --> 11:10.230]  It's what they were called.
[11:10.330 --> 11:11.070]  The boys of Zimmer.
[11:11.430 --> 11:15.490]  That VHS that we're gonna watch
[11:15.490 --> 11:17.430]  isn't that called, like, the boys of Zimmer as well?
[11:17.430 --> 11:18.070]  I think so.
[11:18.070 --> 11:19.190]  I believe it was.
[11:19.190 --> 11:21.490]  And it's like a playoff of the boys of summer, right?
[11:21.810 --> 11:23.790]  Other little one I just threw up.
[11:23.810 --> 11:25.190]  It's just a picture of Humpty Dumpty
[11:25.190 --> 11:26.590]  that I ran into when I was in Detroit.
[11:26.930 --> 11:28.070]  I had a whole Apple weekend.
[11:28.430 --> 11:31.570]  I kind of covered it in the supplemental episode
[11:31.570 --> 11:32.790]  so I don't need to go through it again
[11:32.790 --> 11:35.270]  but I couldn't remember if I shared that creepy ass
[11:38.150 --> 11:39.670]  fucking Humpty Dumpty with y'all or not
[11:39.670 --> 11:42.370]  but it definitely stuck out to me.
[11:42.570 --> 11:43.950]  Once again, Humpty Dumpty also.
[11:44.230 --> 11:45.250]  Don Zimmer, Humpty Dumpty,
[11:45.250 --> 11:47.190]  they're everywhere in the world
[11:47.190 --> 11:49.090]  you just don't realize it until you open your eyes.
[11:49.170 --> 11:50.630]  See, that would make sense.
[11:50.730 --> 11:52.510]  The boys of Dumpty and three eggs.
[11:52.770 --> 11:54.350]  Everyone would know who that was talking about.
[11:59.970 --> 12:00.790]  What's wrong, Eric?
[12:00.890 --> 12:01.510]  What don't you get?
[12:02.250 --> 12:04.470]  The boys of Dumpty?
[12:04.970 --> 12:06.750]  Well, it's the same format.
[12:07.090 --> 12:07.550]  I don't know.
[12:08.330 --> 12:10.130]  It's a global name.
[12:11.390 --> 12:13.350]  Guess who just got back today?
[12:16.150 --> 12:18.670]  The boys of Dumpty that had been away.
[12:24.500 --> 12:25.100]  Jesus.
[12:25.280 --> 12:28.140]  And I'd also be wondering their connection to Dumpty himself.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.100]  Like, were they in the same packet of eggs?
[12:34.200 --> 12:35.520]  Were they also cannons?
[12:36.140 --> 12:36.860]  Yeah, were they cannons?
[12:36.900 --> 12:37.800]  Were they muskets?
[12:39.380 --> 12:41.700]  That's where my confusion is
[12:41.700 --> 12:43.760]  because we talked about how Humpty Dumpty
[12:43.760 --> 12:45.080]  wasn't necessarily an egg
[12:45.080 --> 12:47.100]  and so your thing is
[12:47.100 --> 12:48.720]  it would be an egg
[12:48.720 --> 12:51.000]  but then he wouldn't be on there
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  as an egg
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.540]  but we know he's a cannon
[12:53.540 --> 12:56.040]  so it's just three eggs
[12:56.040 --> 12:59.140]  and it says boys of Dumpty?
[12:59.580 --> 13:00.180]  What?
[13:04.060 --> 13:06.780]  I just don't think it's a strong format.
[13:09.320 --> 13:10.500]  I agree.
[13:10.880 --> 13:13.280]  If it said, if the first thing we saw
[13:13.280 --> 13:14.960]  was boys of Dumpty
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.440]  and three eggs
[13:16.440 --> 13:20.080]  I would say this format's incredibly weak.
[13:24.540 --> 13:26.220]  This is so funny
[13:26.220 --> 13:29.380]  I feel bad about the last episode.
[13:33.380 --> 13:37.060]  Do you think, Gavin, did somebody
[13:37.060 --> 13:38.720]  have to sit the eggs down?
[13:38.820 --> 13:40.480]  Did someone have to sit the boys down
[13:40.480 --> 13:41.960]  and explain what happened to Humpty?
[13:46.380 --> 13:47.580]  We tried!
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.020]  I'm also deeply alarmed
[13:55.020 --> 13:57.080]  by the slushy flavors in that photo
[13:57.080 --> 13:58.880]  What the fuck is a blue raz?
[13:59.560 --> 14:00.940]  What is a blue raz?
[14:01.420 --> 14:04.320]  Blue slushy's a raspberry flavor, aren't they?
[14:04.480 --> 14:04.820]  What?
[14:06.080 --> 14:08.360]  It's like the universal slushy color for a raspberry
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.080]  to differentiate from strawbs.
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.240]  Really?
[14:11.240 --> 14:12.540]  I think so.
[14:12.920 --> 14:15.080]  Like a blue slush puppy?
[14:15.540 --> 14:17.900]  I never would associate that as a raspberry.
[14:18.880 --> 14:19.160]  Huh.
[14:19.280 --> 14:19.800]  You wouldn't?
[14:20.400 --> 14:22.040]  No. It's just blue.
[14:22.300 --> 14:23.480]  It just tastes blue.
[14:23.720 --> 14:26.880]  I mean, you know it's all based on a fruit, right?
[14:26.940 --> 14:27.900]  What fruit would you think?
[14:28.620 --> 14:30.020]  I would assume blueberry.
[14:30.780 --> 14:31.740]  If you're going blue.
[14:32.220 --> 14:35.220]  Typically you make the color match the fruit
[14:35.220 --> 14:36.580]  that it is, not the other way.
[14:36.940 --> 14:39.480]  But does anyone really, on the tip of their tongue
[14:39.480 --> 14:41.400]  know what a blueberry flavor tastes like?
[14:41.440 --> 14:42.620]  Yeah, I love blueberry.
[14:42.960 --> 14:43.920]  What are you talking about?
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.580]  I'm a big blueberry fan too.
[14:45.700 --> 14:48.740]  I mean, I'm a fan. I like the flavor.
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.360]  You can't pluck it from memory
[14:51.360 --> 14:52.680]  as easy as a strawberry.
[14:53.160 --> 14:55.280]  I don't even know what you're saying at that point.
[14:55.460 --> 14:56.780]  I don't know how to argue.
[14:57.960 --> 14:58.720]  The memory?
[15:00.900 --> 15:02.980]  Like it doesn't remember well.
[15:04.420 --> 15:05.360]  What does that mean?
[15:05.480 --> 15:05.940]  What?
[15:05.940 --> 15:06.060]  What?
[15:08.440 --> 15:10.380]  It doesn't remember well?
[15:10.660 --> 15:12.380]  What does a dragon fruit taste like?
[15:12.920 --> 15:13.960]  I've never had one.
[15:14.100 --> 15:15.320]  Never tasted it.
[15:15.900 --> 15:16.880]  Bad example.
[15:17.980 --> 15:19.680]  There's not a single fruit
[15:19.680 --> 15:21.640]  that I've had that I couldn't remember
[15:21.640 --> 15:22.780]  what it tasted like.
[15:23.360 --> 15:23.620]  Really?
[15:24.700 --> 15:27.000]  I think I'm with Andrew on that one.
[15:28.240 --> 15:30.360]  You have fruit forgetfulness.
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.000]  It's only a little bit.
[15:32.160 --> 15:33.780]  If I ate one, I'd be like,
[15:33.780 --> 15:34.540]  it's definitely a blueberry.
[15:34.720 --> 15:35.920]  Like if I ate one blindfolded.
[15:36.020 --> 15:40.740]  If I drank blueberry flavor,
[15:40.820 --> 15:41.780]  I don't think...
[15:42.240 --> 15:43.640]  Sorry, continue.
[15:44.100 --> 15:44.860]  So, okay.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.460]  Gavin, if we're making a poster
[15:47.460 --> 15:48.920]  that said the boys of berries,
[15:49.280 --> 15:50.740]  what berries are you putting on?
[15:50.880 --> 15:52.540]  What are the three...
[15:52.540 --> 15:53.660]  What are your berry types?
[15:54.580 --> 15:56.220]  Well, strawberry and raspberry are in.
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.740]  And probably banana.
[15:59.740 --> 16:00.780]  Banana is a berry.
[16:00.780 --> 16:02.460]  That was a crazy...
[16:02.460 --> 16:03.660]  Banana is still chalky.
[16:03.780 --> 16:05.420]  I will stand to that.
[16:05.660 --> 16:08.360]  You got bad banana memory.
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.280]  You don't even have fruit memory.
[16:10.600 --> 16:12.460]  I can't trust anything that you say
[16:12.460 --> 16:13.620]  about what fruit tastes like.
[16:14.420 --> 16:15.720]  They're not chalky.
[16:16.120 --> 16:18.280]  Chalky to me is like
[16:19.220 --> 16:21.420]  powdery in terms of texture and taste.
[16:22.080 --> 16:22.480]  I don't know.
[16:22.820 --> 16:24.780]  I'm telling you how it is.
[16:25.240 --> 16:26.780]  And I think it's the
[16:27.740 --> 16:28.740]  highest ranked
[16:28.740 --> 16:30.120]  Halo Infinite player here.
[16:30.240 --> 16:31.800]  I think my opinion stands above yours.
[16:32.060 --> 16:32.860]  What are you gold for?
[16:33.680 --> 16:36.900]  As a diamond one.
[16:37.300 --> 16:37.400]  Okay?
[16:38.080 --> 16:39.840]  Your fruit opinions are wrong.
[16:40.160 --> 16:41.020]  And I will hold to this.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.340]  What's the correlation between fruit and Halo?
[16:44.800 --> 16:45.760]  It's just rank.
[16:46.120 --> 16:48.820]  Geoff, as you brought up, it's a military ranking in the past.
[16:48.900 --> 16:50.760]  I just feel like I hold a higher
[16:50.760 --> 16:52.180]  standing in an argument.
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.620]  I'll pull rank. I'll pull Halo rank.
[16:54.900 --> 16:56.600]  Regardless of how relevant it is.
[16:56.600 --> 16:57.940]  I'll pull Halo rank.
[16:58.300 --> 16:59.640]  You gotta be careful of that.
[16:59.900 --> 17:01.780]  Gavin could get himself promoted real quickly.
[17:01.960 --> 17:04.880]  There's no way Gavin's ever gonna pass me in Halo rank.
[17:05.180 --> 17:06.460]  There's a 0% chance.
[17:06.480 --> 17:08.400]  It could happen. I could play with some good people.
[17:09.160 --> 17:10.280]  They could track me up.
[17:10.820 --> 17:12.260]  I don't know about that.
[17:12.440 --> 17:13.860]  Maybe some of Geoff's new friends.
[17:14.840 --> 17:16.080]  Wait till I find my new friends.
[17:16.160 --> 17:18.140]  Then they won't be my friends anymore.
[17:18.220 --> 17:18.740]  They'll leave me for you.
[17:19.160 --> 17:20.280]  Hey, do you wanna play Halo tonight?
[17:20.860 --> 17:22.400]  Uh, yeah. With you?
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.100]  Yeah.
[17:24.020 --> 17:24.540]  Andrew?
[17:25.340 --> 17:25.960]  Are we doing ranked?
[17:26.240 --> 17:27.700]  What are we doing?
[17:31.560 --> 17:32.080]  Uh...
[17:32.080 --> 17:32.580]  Ranked.
[17:32.660 --> 17:34.760]  I like that.
[17:36.040 --> 17:37.720]  One thing I would like to add
[17:37.720 --> 17:38.740]  before we move on.
[17:38.860 --> 17:40.360]  He did such a great job with it.
[17:40.480 --> 17:43.660]  I wanted to send this picture of
[17:43.660 --> 17:45.780]  the accessories Ben made
[17:45.780 --> 17:47.200]  to go along with this action figure.
[17:47.400 --> 17:49.540]  Including an iced coffee
[17:49.540 --> 17:51.260]  four different hands
[17:51.260 --> 17:53.260]  so I can have different hand articulations
[17:53.260 --> 17:55.200]  a butterfly net
[17:55.200 --> 17:57.840]  to catch apples with
[17:57.840 --> 17:59.020]  and a fishing pole.
[17:59.560 --> 18:01.580]  I've been getting updates on this
[18:01.580 --> 18:03.140]  for like a year at this point.
[18:03.740 --> 18:05.580]  I've seen piece by piece.
[18:05.920 --> 18:06.900]  It is amazing.
[18:07.140 --> 18:08.920]  Seeing it all come together is wonderful.
[18:09.100 --> 18:11.660]  I love the Porta Potty photoshoot.
[18:12.200 --> 18:12.800]  It's perfect.
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.020]  He shot it in the real Porta Potty.
[18:15.600 --> 18:16.920]  How did he do it?
[18:17.760 --> 18:18.960]  I think talent.
[18:20.180 --> 18:21.920]  How many different talents
[18:21.920 --> 18:23.080]  do you need to do that?
[18:23.340 --> 18:24.960]  He works in the film industry
[18:24.960 --> 18:25.620]  in England.
[18:26.040 --> 18:28.140]  He is in the art department.
[18:28.400 --> 18:29.760]  I'm not exactly sure.
[18:31.280 --> 18:32.100]  He told me.
[18:33.180 --> 18:34.440]  It's hard to remember the particulars.
[18:34.520 --> 18:35.380]  He is in the art department.
[18:35.600 --> 18:38.040]  He does a lot of graphic work.
[18:38.340 --> 18:39.300]  He does some physical work.
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.600]  He is real tight with all the other people
[18:42.600 --> 18:43.120]  in the art department.
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.200]  They do this kind of stuff for fun occasionally.
[18:45.820 --> 18:47.020]  He got some other
[18:47.020 --> 18:48.440]  people to make maquettes.
[18:50.480 --> 18:51.500]  The craziest thing
[18:51.500 --> 18:53.240]  about it is I took my clothes off.
[18:53.400 --> 18:53.960]  I got a dick.
[18:54.440 --> 18:55.960]  It's not bad. It's like a real dick.
[18:57.880 --> 18:59.400]  Do you guys want to see my dick?
[18:59.720 --> 19:00.060]  I'll show you.
[19:00.800 --> 19:01.880]  I think I'm good.
[19:02.500 --> 19:03.140]  I want to see.
[19:04.540 --> 19:07.600]  He is in the Don Pedro shirt.
[19:08.200 --> 19:09.400]  All my tattoos are there.
[19:09.480 --> 19:10.780]  Physically, the real tattoos.
[19:10.780 --> 19:12.080]  Which is insanity.
[19:12.600 --> 19:13.340]  Is my nose on there?
[19:13.760 --> 19:15.020]  I believe so, yes.
[19:15.360 --> 19:17.780]  I'm excited about taking this photo of my fucking cock.
[19:23.380 --> 19:25.120]  Pull your little pants back up, Geoffy.
[19:27.600 --> 19:28.680]  Stuck on your butt.
[19:29.100 --> 19:30.720]  There we go.
[19:35.780 --> 19:36.740]  So stupid.
[19:37.240 --> 19:38.160]  It's like a real doll.
[19:38.880 --> 19:39.280]  Well...
[19:40.320 --> 19:41.620]  TBD, I'll let you know
[19:42.100 --> 19:42.860]  how it looks.
[19:44.580 --> 19:46.040]  Eric said it's like a real doll,
[19:46.160 --> 19:47.440]  so I said I'll let you know how it looks.
[19:49.100 --> 19:50.280]  Not actually going to have
[19:50.280 --> 19:52.240]  sex with it, but...
[19:52.240 --> 19:52.380]  Yeah.
[19:54.260 --> 19:55.060]  Oh, God.
[19:55.660 --> 19:56.760]  There's pubes on it.
[19:57.060 --> 19:58.740]  I've got a bell in.
[20:00.120 --> 20:00.920]  You're circumcised.
[20:01.480 --> 20:03.820]  I am circumcised. I've got a dick.
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.380]  I can't believe it.
[20:06.380 --> 20:07.540]  Why did he put that detail?
[20:09.880 --> 20:11.340]  Well, I'll tell you something else, Gavin.
[20:11.680 --> 20:13.580]  Our artists are an interesting bunch.
[20:14.020 --> 20:15.720]  Did you know that this is
[20:15.720 --> 20:17.740]  years and years and years ago, at the day job,
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.800]  we had an online comic called
[20:19.800 --> 20:21.740]  RT Comics, and another Canadian,
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.180]  a guy named Luke McKay,
[20:23.780 --> 20:25.700]  he drew it, and then my ex-wife wrote
[20:25.700 --> 20:27.980]  the comics, and Luke
[20:27.980 --> 20:29.880]  would draw us. It was all the RT
[20:29.880 --> 20:31.860]  characters and, like, you know, whatever
[20:31.860 --> 20:33.620]  scenarios that she wrote for them.
[20:33.940 --> 20:35.680]  He drew our dicks
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.580]  under every pair of pants.
[20:37.660 --> 20:39.620]  Every time he drew anybody from our company,
[20:39.940 --> 20:41.960]  he drew a dick before he put the pants on.
[20:42.200 --> 20:43.440]  He showed me in Photoshop layers.
[20:43.720 --> 20:45.320]  He's like, when I put the books together,
[20:45.580 --> 20:47.820]  you know, because we had, like, five books, he would show me. He'd be like, hey, you want to see your dick?
[20:47.920 --> 20:49.820]  There it is. Every fucking time he drew
[20:49.820 --> 20:51.920]  any of us from the knees
[20:51.920 --> 20:53.960]  up, they had a dick the entire time.
[20:54.320 --> 20:55.040]  How was the detail?
[20:55.480 --> 20:57.340]  It was commensurate with the rest of
[20:57.740 --> 20:58.800]  his art, you know? Similar.
[20:59.300 --> 21:00.660]  In vein and style.
[21:00.880 --> 21:02.880]  That's interesting. I can't wait for Jack
[21:02.880 --> 21:04.680]  to look at these images without context.
[21:04.680 --> 21:05.920]  That's gonna be a good one.
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.080]  We should start
[21:09.080 --> 21:10.820]  having Jack record
[21:10.820 --> 21:12.820]  like one-minute summaries of the
[21:12.820 --> 21:14.900]  episodes, but he hasn't listened to them yet.
[21:16.060 --> 21:17.160]  And put them as like,
[21:17.240 --> 21:18.760]  next week on F*** Face.
[21:20.120 --> 21:20.600]  Oh!
[21:21.100 --> 21:22.600]  Oh! How about this?
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.820]  Do you guys think we need some sort of a
[21:24.820 --> 21:26.540]  hand signal or a handshake?
[21:26.540 --> 21:28.040]  Because I came up with one.
[21:28.380 --> 21:30.360]  Well, I feel like that was...
[21:30.360 --> 21:31.560]  Yeah, we talked about that, right?
[21:31.680 --> 21:34.480]  Did we? Yeah, that was the whole thing we discussed.
[21:34.960 --> 21:35.720]  When did we discuss that?
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.400]  That was like two episodes ago, like around the
[21:38.400 --> 21:40.400]  Dusty Baker thing, which kind of led into
[21:40.400 --> 21:42.580]  the High Five, different things of like
[21:42.580 --> 21:44.320]  a long distance and new version of it.
[21:44.660 --> 21:46.520]  I guess that must have been why it was rattling around
[21:46.520 --> 21:48.400]  in the back of my head, but it
[21:48.400 --> 21:50.560]  hit me the other day, I think I came up with something.
[21:50.960 --> 21:52.400]  We asked people to send them.
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.320]  Okay, well I came up with one of my own.
[21:54.320 --> 21:55.220]  Did anybody send any?
[21:55.780 --> 21:58.280]  Yeah, there was one that I think was called the belly flop
[21:58.280 --> 22:00.060]  or something, where it was like both hands
[22:01.060 --> 22:02.220]  downward, I want to say.
[22:02.320 --> 22:03.580]  This is a few weeks ago at this point.
[22:04.360 --> 22:06.600]  It's not clear, it's not fresh in my mind,
[22:06.620 --> 22:08.160]  but I'm excited to see yours.
[22:08.540 --> 22:10.340]  Nothing of note. I think I'm going to film
[22:10.340 --> 22:12.660]  it right now, just because it's easier to show you guys.
[22:12.860 --> 22:14.820]  So let me put my video, I'm going to record.
[22:15.500 --> 22:16.580]  It starts with a baseball
[22:17.120 --> 22:18.260]  bat, choke up,
[22:18.900 --> 22:20.360]  swing into an apple,
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.460]  and then you take a bite
[22:22.460 --> 22:24.720]  out of it. It sounds like you're just doing a TikTok dance.
[22:25.120 --> 22:25.820]  Nope, nope.
[22:25.920 --> 22:27.780]  I feel like I just heard a TikTok dance.
[22:27.900 --> 22:29.160]  There's no dancing going on.
[22:30.880 --> 22:32.500]  Can I get that up on the...
[22:33.160 --> 22:34.580]  Let's watch this be too big for
[22:34.580 --> 22:34.940]  Discord.
[22:35.100 --> 22:38.720]  So I'm holding my hands like I'm holding a bat.
[22:39.140 --> 22:40.340]  Is that phase one?
[22:40.860 --> 22:41.940]  Yeah, phase one is the bat.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.840]  Okay, so
[22:44.360 --> 22:46.440]  are both people doing this, or is one
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.200]  hand of each person...
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.500]  No, you just do it when you see somebody.
[22:49.500 --> 22:51.300]  Okay, yeah. Alright, I'm going to watch this now.
[22:52.340 --> 22:53.560]  Where's the high five part?
[22:53.840 --> 22:54.540]  There is no high five.
[22:55.380 --> 22:56.520]  What are we...
[22:56.520 --> 22:58.220]  What was that?
[22:59.020 --> 23:00.300]  It was a hand signal.
[23:00.600 --> 23:02.140]  Okay, a hand signal. Got it.
[23:02.160 --> 23:05.500]  I didn't say anything about a high five, I just said that we need a handshake or a signal.
[23:06.200 --> 23:07.540]  Maybe if you do that into a crowd
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.400]  of people and anyone does it back, they know
[23:09.400 --> 23:10.480]  that you're a f*** facer.
[23:10.580 --> 23:12.820]  They know that you're a regulation listener.
[23:13.300 --> 23:15.540]  Like NBA players, when they go out onto the court,
[23:15.600 --> 23:17.320]  they do like 75 different wacky
[23:18.740 --> 23:19.380]  handshake thing
[23:19.380 --> 23:21.460]  and they touch their toe and then touch their elbows
[23:21.460 --> 23:23.620]  and do a cool thing. I thought it'd be cool if we had our own version of it.
[23:23.640 --> 23:25.280]  Okay. And I think it hits baseball
[23:25.280 --> 23:27.340]  because we used to be a baseball podcast, and then it
[23:27.340 --> 23:29.520]  hits apples because we are an apple podcast.
[23:29.940 --> 23:31.300]  Oh, I like it. So I thought it's a combination
[23:31.300 --> 23:32.400]  of the old and the new.
[23:32.860 --> 23:35.180]  I feel like it's a universal sign if you're a boy
[23:35.180 --> 23:37.420]  or a zimmer, or not. You gotta be careful.
[23:38.200 --> 23:39.240]  The only area
[23:39.240 --> 23:41.360]  you gotta worry about is when you're making the apple sign
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.280]  with your hands, you gotta be careful you're not making
[23:43.280 --> 23:45.440]  one of those anime hearts that everybody loves to do.
[23:45.440 --> 23:46.800]  Because it's not. It's an apple.
[23:47.080 --> 23:49.560]  We're not taking a bite out of a heart, we're taking a bite out of a big apple.
[23:49.980 --> 23:51.880]  I just don't think I've ever taken a bite
[23:51.880 --> 23:53.540]  out of an apple that I'm holding with both hands.
[23:57.260 --> 23:59.260]  I need both hands to make the apple.
[24:01.060 --> 24:01.780]  The representation
[24:01.780 --> 24:03.340]  of the apple. Why do you have to be difficult?
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.220]  Do you?
[24:05.260 --> 24:08.020]  I feel like you could just have an apple with one hand.
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.520]  I feel like you gotta pretend
[24:09.520 --> 24:11.300]  that you're rubbing it off on your shirt.
[24:11.920 --> 24:12.380]  No, no, no.
[24:12.380 --> 24:14.160]  Well, now that's interesting.
[24:14.620 --> 24:15.600]  Rubbing it off on your shirt is interesting.
[24:16.040 --> 24:18.160]  I do think though, so you start with
[24:18.160 --> 24:20.200]  part one, the swing, you swing, that if any of you
[24:20.200 --> 24:22.360]  just come with one hand and you make like a half circle
[24:22.360 --> 24:24.600]  it just looks like you've got a baseball now.
[24:24.800 --> 24:26.420]  Because you've just hit something with a baseball bat.
[24:26.640 --> 24:28.000]  I think the apple sells it.
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.900]  So you're saying that the second hand
[24:29.900 --> 24:31.940]  differentiates a baseball from an apple.
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.480]  Yes, the second hand
[24:34.160 --> 24:36.000]  differentiates a baseball from an apple. Thank you.
[24:36.260 --> 24:38.340]  I will say, if you just show
[24:38.340 --> 24:40.180]  a photo to people of you
[24:40.180 --> 24:42.100]  doing your apple gesture, I don't know how many
[24:42.100 --> 24:44.220]  of them would say that you're making an apple with your hands.
[24:44.620 --> 24:46.200]  Well, that's because it's designed
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.200]  to be viewed fluidly as a video.
[24:48.520 --> 24:50.040]  It's not a static thing.
[24:50.500 --> 24:51.700]  Do you have an apple shirt on?
[24:51.920 --> 24:53.400]  I do have an apple shirt on, yeah.
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.600]  So have you been more into apples or cider?
[24:55.740 --> 24:56.860]  What was that trip mainly about?
[24:57.440 --> 24:59.500]  I guess you're not drinking alcoholic cider.
[25:00.140 --> 25:02.320]  No, that trip was my yearly apple trip
[25:02.780 --> 25:03.920]  and it's honestly
[25:03.920 --> 25:06.160]  about two things. Well, three things.
[25:06.560 --> 25:07.840]  It's about cider.
[25:07.840 --> 25:09.100]  Fresh, hot
[25:09.600 --> 25:10.840]  cider on a cold day.
[25:11.560 --> 25:13.720]  It's about apple cinnamon
[25:13.720 --> 25:15.920]  doughnuts. Like these hot apple cinnamon
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.200]  doughnuts you get in
[25:17.840 --> 25:19.920]  Michigan. And it's about
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.700]  sliced apples with
[25:21.700 --> 25:23.740]  caramel drizzled on it and nuts. That's what I always get
[25:23.740 --> 25:25.260]  when I go. Those are like the big three things.
[25:25.740 --> 25:27.980]  But it's like an apple orgy, dude.
[25:28.240 --> 25:29.620]  Andrew would lose his fucking mind.
[25:30.240 --> 25:31.020]  It's insane.
[25:31.540 --> 25:33.640]  It's in Detroit? It would be like Shangri-La.
[25:34.140 --> 25:35.240]  Outside of Detroit, yeah.
[25:35.240 --> 25:36.320]  In Grosse Pointe, that area.
[25:36.660 --> 25:38.600]  There's cider mills everywhere.
[25:38.760 --> 25:39.960]  And it's like apples for days.
[25:41.140 --> 25:43.220]  That's really cool. That's where I got the shirt from.
[25:43.760 --> 25:44.820]  Is there like...
[25:46.100 --> 25:47.160]  Is there like
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.080]  a days of summer type thing but with
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.920]  apples? Just touring different
[25:50.920 --> 25:52.740]  parts of the US
[25:52.740 --> 25:55.040]  getting the apples as they ripen across
[25:55.040 --> 25:56.980]  the season? I think that's a great idea.
[25:56.980 --> 25:58.800]  Maybe that's like a journey I go on
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.740]  fully embrace the apple lifestyle.
[26:01.400 --> 26:02.780]  I think there's a lot you could learn from it.
[26:02.780 --> 26:04.660]  For instance, I have a bunch of apple facts
[26:04.660 --> 26:06.140]  I could throw out.
[26:06.680 --> 26:08.080]  I'd love an apple fact.
[26:08.680 --> 26:10.540]  Did you know that apples are the second most
[26:10.540 --> 26:12.340]  valuable fruit in the United States?
[26:12.980 --> 26:14.260]  Oranges are the first.
[26:14.760 --> 26:16.820]  There were a bunch of apple signs
[26:16.820 --> 26:19.100]  and I just took pictures of all of them at the cider mill
[26:19.100 --> 26:20.960]  so I could... Sounds like a top tier fruit.
[26:21.500 --> 26:22.800]  Johnny Appleseed Chapman
[26:22.800 --> 26:24.400]  brought a small variety of apples from Europe.
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.840]  He spent his life planting apple trees across America.
[26:26.880 --> 26:28.880]  Who cares? Uh... I don't care about him.
[26:29.300 --> 26:30.760]  Here we go. The most beautiful
[26:30.760 --> 26:32.980]  apples are known to grow in the state
[26:32.980 --> 26:34.840]  of what? The most beautiful
[26:34.840 --> 26:36.240]  we're talking just apple beauty.
[26:36.860 --> 26:38.340]  Where are the most beautiful?
[26:38.420 --> 26:40.020]  A little bit of apple trivia for you. Maine.
[26:40.920 --> 26:42.300]  Alright, Gavin's answer is Maine.
[26:42.580 --> 26:45.020]  Andrew, where do you think the most beautiful apples in America are grown?
[26:46.740 --> 26:47.140]  Uh...
[26:47.860 --> 26:48.940]  I'm going to say
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.980]  they're going to keep it. It's a humble brag.
[26:51.060 --> 26:52.720]  They're bragging about themselves. I'm going to say Michigan.
[26:53.100 --> 26:54.800]  Michigan. Alright. And Eric, your
[26:54.800 --> 26:56.980]  answer is Washington. Nick, do you have a...
[26:56.980 --> 26:58.340]  Do you want to weigh in here? Do you care?
[26:58.340 --> 27:00.240]  I mean, Washington have like the
[27:00.240 --> 27:02.060]  the organization, don't they?
[27:02.580 --> 27:04.040]  The answer is Washington. Yeah.
[27:04.120 --> 27:06.620]  The most beautiful apples are known to grow in the state of Washington.
[27:06.760 --> 27:08.060]  However, the most
[27:08.640 --> 27:10.500]  flavorful are in the eastern states.
[27:10.520 --> 27:12.340]  While Washington ranks number one in producing
[27:12.340 --> 27:14.340]  apples in the United States at nearly 60%.
[27:14.880 --> 27:16.260]  New York, believe it or not,
[27:16.280 --> 27:17.620]  is number two at 11%.
[27:18.180 --> 27:20.320]  Michigan is a distant third
[27:20.320 --> 27:21.860]  with 8%.
[27:21.860 --> 27:23.780]  Cosmic Crisp Apple is from Washington.
[27:24.340 --> 27:26.180]  That is correct. Eric was asking.
[27:26.180 --> 27:28.100]  It is a Washington apple.
[27:28.380 --> 27:29.560]  Those are my apple facts.
[27:30.060 --> 27:32.020]  I learned that like the Granny Smith
[27:32.020 --> 27:33.320]  apple was made accidentally.
[27:33.540 --> 27:36.000]  I learned that the other day. One was just like throwing
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.060]  apples out her window and accidentally made the Granny
[27:38.060 --> 27:39.560]  Smith apple. Wait, what?
[27:40.040 --> 27:42.020]  The inventor of the Granny Smith
[27:42.020 --> 27:43.920]  apple accidentally made it. She was
[27:43.920 --> 27:46.040]  throwing crab apples out her
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.940]  window and they lived on like an
[27:47.940 --> 27:50.280]  orchard and it just happened to mix
[27:50.280 --> 27:52.080]  with a different type of apple
[27:52.080 --> 27:54.180]  and it created the Granny
[27:54.180 --> 27:55.940]  Smith apple. Complete accident.
[27:56.440 --> 27:58.540]  That brings up a question
[27:58.540 --> 28:00.220]  I have. What's so
[28:00.220 --> 28:02.160]  funny about that, Gavin? She died two years later.
[28:02.260 --> 28:04.320]  She never even got to live in the
[28:04.320 --> 28:05.740]  world of the Granny Smith apple.
[28:06.200 --> 28:07.280]  Was her last name Smith?
[28:07.820 --> 28:10.220]  It was. It was her husband's last
[28:10.220 --> 28:12.380]  name and they both died two years later
[28:12.380 --> 28:14.220]  and then somebody bought the orchard and was
[28:14.220 --> 28:15.880]  like, I'll just call them Granny Smith apples.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.220]  And then they became super famous.
[28:17.880 --> 28:19.140]  What a sweet homage.
[28:20.080 --> 28:22.280]  If they didn't realize what they'd come
[28:22.280 --> 28:24.460]  up with though, why would it be a memorable story?
[28:25.140 --> 28:25.480]  What do you mean?
[28:26.300 --> 28:27.420]  What are you asking? Sorry.
[28:28.180 --> 28:30.540]  Did they know the success
[28:30.540 --> 28:31.120]  of the apple?
[28:33.740 --> 28:34.540]  She would
[28:34.540 --> 28:36.340]  make apples and apple
[28:36.340 --> 28:38.200]  pies and sell them and then
[28:38.200 --> 28:40.200]  she made this apple that was like, holy fuck,
[28:40.280 --> 28:42.100]  this is a good apple. People like this apple.
[28:42.180 --> 28:44.120]  It's a great baking apple. She had
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.240]  some success with it and she had
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.320]  somebody come in and characterize it and be like,
[28:48.380 --> 28:50.260]  yeah, this is a new species of apple.
[28:50.260 --> 28:52.420]  She started growing it, then she
[28:52.420 --> 28:54.140]  died. Then her husband died
[28:54.140 --> 28:56.320]  shortly after. And then somebody
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.340]  just bought the orchard and just mass
[28:58.340 --> 29:00.500]  produced them. So she never got...
[29:00.500 --> 29:02.200]  Yeah, the person that created the Granny
[29:02.200 --> 29:04.340]  Smith apple has no real awareness of
[29:04.340 --> 29:06.240]  how popular it became. It didn't become
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.340]  a huge success until after the guy
[29:08.340 --> 29:10.380]  bought everything. So what if we just took
[29:10.380 --> 29:12.380]  every single known apple
[29:12.380 --> 29:14.320]  and had a big
[29:14.320 --> 29:16.380]  food fight with a hundred people throwing these apples?
[29:16.520 --> 29:18.160]  Would we potentially make an apple
[29:18.160 --> 29:18.920]  in the middle somewhere?
[29:21.120 --> 29:21.860]  Not... Oh,
[29:22.200 --> 29:24.160]  this is where I wanted to take
[29:24.160 --> 29:26.100]  this. That is phenomenal, Gavin.
[29:26.520 --> 29:28.120]  That's a great idea. I
[29:28.120 --> 29:29.780]  want us to make our own apple.
[29:30.860 --> 29:31.900]  Okay. Why not?
[29:32.660 --> 29:33.280]  Why not?
[29:33.580 --> 29:35.240]  There was a note I had written down.
[29:36.180 --> 29:38.080]  I'm seeing you birth the idea in front of me.
[29:38.280 --> 29:39.860]  That's exactly what we need to do.
[29:40.080 --> 29:42.160]  I think we could do it with a little bit more intent, but I
[29:42.160 --> 29:43.380]  love the random nature of it.
[29:44.360 --> 29:46.040]  The Cosmic Crisp was invented
[29:46.040 --> 29:48.060]  in our lifetimes, so why can't we
[29:48.060 --> 29:50.140]  invent the F*** Facer, or whatever we
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.780]  call it? The Regulation Apple.
[29:52.180 --> 29:53.220]  Regulation Apple!
[29:53.860 --> 29:56.100]  Oh, it's like it
[29:56.100 --> 29:58.000]  was meant to be! A
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.840]  Regulation Apple! That's what everybody
[29:59.840 --> 30:02.120]  needs! Then you know out the
[30:02.120 --> 30:03.360]  gate what you're getting!
[30:03.920 --> 30:05.580]  Oh, we've got to invent it! Oh,
[30:05.960 --> 30:07.720]  we have to invent an apple that's
[30:07.720 --> 30:09.980]  regulation. So what are the
[30:10.640 --> 30:12.220]  requirements for cross-breeding?
[30:12.400 --> 30:14.300]  Do we need, like, one seed
[30:14.760 --> 30:16.260]  from one, like, how does an apple
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.500]  how does an apple make a baby?
[30:19.060 --> 30:20.380]  I feel like, I don't
[30:20.380 --> 30:22.280]  from what it says, like, we just need a
[30:22.280 --> 30:24.240]  viable window. We just need a good
[30:24.240 --> 30:25.880]  window to throw some apples out of.
[30:26.100 --> 30:28.240]  Are we going to get into splicing? I think
[30:28.240 --> 30:30.320]  you have to splice it. I mean, Granny Smith
[30:30.320 --> 30:32.380]  didn't. Granny Smith did not splice.
[30:33.040 --> 30:34.360]  It sounds like she just had
[30:34.360 --> 30:36.340]  a lawn full of rot
[30:36.340 --> 30:36.940]  that made an apple.
[30:38.140 --> 30:40.260]  It sounded like Granny Smith's backyard
[30:40.260 --> 30:41.660]  trash can just yielded
[30:41.660 --> 30:43.100]  unexpected results.
[30:44.900 --> 30:45.660]  Well, we'll look
[30:45.660 --> 30:47.660]  into it, right? I don't know how to make an
[30:47.660 --> 30:49.300]  apple, but I think we could invent one.
[30:49.620 --> 30:51.800]  And then, when we invent our own apple,
[30:52.040 --> 30:53.680]  here's where we go with it, right? So we
[30:53.680 --> 30:55.620]  invent the apple, takes the nation
[30:55.620 --> 30:57.180]  by storm, eventually the world, hopefully.
[30:57.540 --> 30:59.700]  Then, we follow up with it. We're already
[30:59.700 --> 31:01.520]  working on it in the background, because it's going to take a while.
[31:01.780 --> 31:03.220]  Then we follow up with our boom,
[31:03.560 --> 31:05.820]  our fucking, our badass hot cider.
[31:06.120 --> 31:07.680]  Whatever that is. Regulation cider.
[31:08.040 --> 31:09.540]  And that's, people love cider.
[31:09.540 --> 31:10.700]  Great on a cold day.
[31:11.920 --> 31:13.700]  Some people can mix booze with it if they're
[31:13.700 --> 31:14.280]  into that thing.
[31:15.520 --> 31:17.220]  I see a lot of potential for us here.
[31:17.720 --> 31:19.500]  I apologize if we've already covered it.
[31:19.600 --> 31:21.420]  I feel like we led into this episode
[31:21.420 --> 31:23.060]  and then haven't actually touched on the thing.
[31:23.300 --> 31:25.580]  You wanted to create an unscrumpable
[31:25.580 --> 31:27.500]  bag? I feel like this also ties
[31:27.500 --> 31:29.400]  into that. Well, yeah. That's why
[31:29.400 --> 31:31.560]  I asked earlier, before I dumped into that,
[31:31.660 --> 31:33.720]  I said, are we going to continue with apples?
[31:34.140 --> 31:35.280]  Or should I peel it back?
[31:35.680 --> 31:37.600]  Get it? Peel it back. Should I peel it back?
[31:37.600 --> 31:39.580]  Because I don't want to
[31:39.580 --> 31:41.560]  dump a lot of energy on the
[31:41.560 --> 31:43.600]  apple front if it's not a direction that the
[31:43.600 --> 31:45.520]  podcast is headed. You know, I don't want to just
[31:45.520 --> 31:47.600]  sit and retread old ground.
[31:48.540 --> 31:49.620]  Because there's a whole world
[31:49.620 --> 31:51.480]  of apples out there I was not aware of. Did you guys know
[31:51.480 --> 31:53.640]  there's black apples? I've never
[31:53.640 --> 31:54.500]  heard of a black apple.
[31:55.740 --> 31:57.580]  I also saw people posted pictures
[31:57.580 --> 31:59.600]  of an apple that's like red
[31:59.600 --> 32:01.140]  on the inside. It's like pinkish.
[32:01.800 --> 32:02.900]  I didn't see that.
[32:03.600 --> 32:05.040]  I want to try that one. That looks good.
[32:05.040 --> 32:06.740]  I also want to try it.
[32:06.900 --> 32:08.700]  Yeah, look at this. This is going to freak you out.
[32:08.920 --> 32:09.580]  It's a little freaky.
[32:10.020 --> 32:12.400]  Oh, that's Apple Watch.
[32:13.880 --> 32:14.580]  Here we go.
[32:14.840 --> 32:16.900]  This is called... I'm waiting for Geoff
[32:16.900 --> 32:19.000]  to send his action figure dick again.
[32:19.200 --> 32:21.040]  I'm not expecting that.
[32:21.160 --> 32:22.980]  I warned you I was sending you my action
[32:22.980 --> 32:24.800]  figure dick. I didn't just throw that at you.
[32:25.180 --> 32:27.040]  Unannounced. Okay, boom. There you go.
[32:27.380 --> 32:29.080]  That's what a black diamond apple looks
[32:29.080 --> 32:31.060]  like. Costs about seven bucks an apple.
[32:31.620 --> 32:32.160]  They're expensive.
[32:32.160 --> 32:33.580]  Put a gloss on it.
[32:33.880 --> 32:35.140]  It looks like you're looking into space.
[32:35.520 --> 32:37.340]  It looks like you're looking into space.
[32:37.920 --> 32:39.700]  Should we have a rare apple taste?
[32:40.380 --> 32:41.840]  Well, we're going to need
[32:41.840 --> 32:44.000]  we're going to need Apple
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  experience if we're going to invent the next
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.060]  apple. Yeah.
[32:47.600 --> 32:49.700]  What if our apple was black also?
[32:50.200 --> 32:51.800]  It could be. It really could be.
[32:52.140 --> 32:53.800]  It would match our color palette for the podcast.
[32:54.480 --> 32:56.260]  That's an excellent point.
[32:56.920 --> 32:58.180]  Oh, I wonder
[32:58.180 --> 33:00.240]  if anybody's ever been able
[33:00.240 --> 33:01.500]  to design an apple that
[33:02.040 --> 33:04.160]  has the logo branded in it.
[33:05.440 --> 33:07.280]  Like, could we
[33:09.540 --> 33:10.340]  grow an
[33:10.340 --> 33:12.200]  apple that already
[33:12.200 --> 33:14.040]  says regulation apple on it?
[33:14.280 --> 33:16.020]  If you grow an apple that knows English.
[33:20.340 --> 33:24.140]  Well, I don't know much about
[33:24.140 --> 33:26.240]  apples yet, but I like
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.160]  the black diamond apple so far.
[33:28.160 --> 33:29.740]  Yeah, it's beautiful. It looks like
[33:29.740 --> 33:31.140]  a galaxy, kind of.
[33:31.760 --> 33:34.160]  There's a whole world of apples out there, if that's the direction
[33:34.160 --> 33:35.080]  we want to continue down.
[33:35.380 --> 33:38.100]  If we've already beaten the audience
[33:38.100 --> 33:40.020]  over the head with apples for too much,
[33:40.080 --> 33:40.780]  then I don't want to do it.
[33:41.420 --> 33:43.060]  I think there's a lot of potential.
[33:43.280 --> 33:45.560]  Maybe it's something to come back to.
[33:46.240 --> 33:47.680]  Yeah, I think we've got to go to the lab.
[33:48.220 --> 33:49.400]  I feel like we could definitely make
[33:49.400 --> 33:52.120]  if we got Eric to get a selection
[33:52.120 --> 33:53.600]  of maybe six rare apples
[33:53.600 --> 33:55.580]  in a nice foam case again,
[33:55.580 --> 33:56.980]  and we'll have Andrew watch.
[33:57.100 --> 33:58.580]  We could definitely do a nice new tasting.
[33:58.980 --> 34:00.540]  Give our reviews of each one.
[34:01.120 --> 34:01.900]  That's a great idea.
[34:02.420 --> 34:03.880]  Eric says already working on it.
[34:03.980 --> 34:05.320]  That's a great idea.
[34:05.980 --> 34:07.720]  I think I could buy some black apple seeds.
[34:08.700 --> 34:11.500]  You don't have to grow the freaking tree every time.
[34:11.840 --> 34:13.360]  Well, it's just I can't see
[34:13.360 --> 34:14.840]  anywhere else to get this apple.
[34:15.220 --> 34:16.140]  I want this apple.
[34:16.580 --> 34:18.200]  I already said I'll fly you here.
[34:18.940 --> 34:20.640]  I'll use Betty White's money.
[34:21.520 --> 34:23.700]  We got about $650
[34:23.700 --> 34:24.620]  after taxes.
[34:25.100 --> 34:26.180]  We're burning a hole in our pocket.
[34:28.460 --> 34:29.640]  I really want to win
[34:29.640 --> 34:30.640]  the Betty White contest.
[34:30.900 --> 34:33.360]  I want you to. It's already over now
[34:33.360 --> 34:34.240]  by the time this comes out.
[34:34.340 --> 34:37.180]  It is. It will be known if we were picked or not.
[34:41.740 --> 34:42.940]  We all shop online.
[34:43.200 --> 34:44.660]  I do it, well,
[34:44.800 --> 34:46.180]  more than I probably should.
[34:46.320 --> 34:48.400]  Multiple times a day.
[34:48.600 --> 34:50.560]  And we've all seen that promo code
[34:50.560 --> 34:52.260]  field taunt us at checkout saying
[34:52.880 --> 34:54.840]  there are savings to be had.
[34:54.840 --> 34:56.460]  You just have no access to them.
[34:56.740 --> 34:58.740]  But thanks to Honey, manually searching
[34:58.740 --> 35:01.080]  for coupon codes is a thing of the past.
[35:01.400 --> 35:02.720]  Honey is a free shopping tool
[35:02.720 --> 35:04.740]  that scours the internet for promo
[35:04.740 --> 35:06.920]  codes and applies the best one it finds
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.960]  to your cart. It's doing a lot
[35:08.960 --> 35:10.520]  of work for you. Honey
[35:10.520 --> 35:12.840]  must really love you. Honey supports
[35:12.840 --> 35:14.780]  over 30,000 stores online.
[35:15.120 --> 35:16.760]  I've tried my best to shop at
[35:16.760 --> 35:18.220]  all of them. I'm getting close.
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.620]  These range from sites that have tech and gaming
[35:20.620 --> 35:22.840]  products to popular fashion brands, that's me,
[35:22.840 --> 35:24.440]  to even food delivery.
[35:24.680 --> 35:26.060]  That was me saying,
[35:26.800 --> 35:28.580]  because of food. Here's how it works.
[35:28.900 --> 35:30.900]  Imagine you're shopping on one or
[35:30.900 --> 35:32.820]  many of your favorite sites. And when you go to
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.800]  checkout, the Honey button will drop down.
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.940]  It does it all the time. It's very convenient.
[35:37.180 --> 35:38.720]  And all you have to do is click
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.660]  apply coupons. Wait a few seconds
[35:40.660 --> 35:42.940]  as Honey searches for coupons across
[35:42.940 --> 35:44.500]  the entire internet
[35:44.500 --> 35:46.940]  and then all the ones that it
[35:46.940 --> 35:48.440]  finds, if it finds them,
[35:48.940 --> 35:50.820]  boom, throws it on there and you
[35:50.820 --> 35:52.640]  watch the prices drop. So I've
[35:52.640 --> 35:54.680]  decided to put a moratorium on
[35:54.680 --> 35:56.660]  the story about the paddle boards. I'm
[35:56.660 --> 35:58.760]  never going to tell it again. I did save money on
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.000]  them. However,
[36:00.740 --> 36:02.680]  I'm trying to be current. I'm going to give you guys
[36:02.680 --> 36:04.620]  the things that I've been saving money on lately. And I've been saving
[36:04.620 --> 36:06.360]  a lot of money lately. However,
[36:06.920 --> 36:08.740]  it's all bid on Christmas presents.
[36:08.940 --> 36:10.620]  So I'm not going to spoil
[36:10.620 --> 36:12.600]  Christmas by saying exactly what
[36:12.600 --> 36:14.800]  I've purchased over the last
[36:14.800 --> 36:16.560]  couple days and
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.600]  received benefits from Honey. But I will say
[36:18.600 --> 36:19.740]  that there was a
[36:20.860 --> 36:22.640]  kitchenery site and
[36:22.640 --> 36:24.640]  maybe an
[36:24.640 --> 36:26.580]  online book retailer and a couple of
[36:26.580 --> 36:28.420]  other places that I
[36:28.420 --> 36:30.540]  have found some pretty
[36:31.680 --> 36:32.720]  hefty discounts
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.640]  on thanks to Honey. I'll tell you
[36:34.640 --> 36:36.580]  about it in January after the moratorium
[36:36.580 --> 36:38.540]  on Christmas is over. As a matter of fact,
[36:38.620 --> 36:40.540]  Honey has found its over 17 million
[36:40.540 --> 36:42.840]  members more than $2 billion
[36:42.840 --> 36:44.260]  in savings.
[36:44.520 --> 36:46.460]  That's the amount of money that Kendall tried to buy
[36:46.460 --> 36:48.260]  Logan Roy out of the family business for
[36:48.260 --> 36:50.320]  last night on Succession. Crazy.
[36:50.800 --> 36:52.540]  If you don't already have Honey, you could be
[36:52.540 --> 36:54.360]  straight up missing out on free savings.
[36:54.480 --> 36:56.460]  It is literally free and installs in
[36:56.460 --> 36:58.360]  a few seconds. And by getting it, you'll be doing

[37:00.380 --> 37:02.500]  podcast. I'd never recommend something I don't
[37:02.500 --> 37:04.380]  use. So get Honey for free

[37:08.920 --> 37:09.760]  slash face.
[37:10.040 --> 37:12.500]  It's the giving season, everybody. That's right.
[37:12.800 --> 37:14.600]  The holidays have approached.
[37:14.600 --> 37:16.640]  They are upon us. And it is time
[37:16.640 --> 37:18.700]  to show your family
[37:18.700 --> 37:20.900]  and friends that you care about them
[37:20.900 --> 37:22.680]  in a meaningful and memorable
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.720]  way. And what better way to
[37:24.720 --> 37:26.820]  do that than with a clean butthole?
[37:27.060 --> 37:28.380]  That's right. Hello, Tushy.
[37:28.660 --> 37:30.500]  Bidets tick all those boxes.
[37:30.700 --> 37:32.120]  Are you buying for a family member?
[37:32.520 --> 37:34.580]  They need a bidet. Are you buying for a
[37:34.580 --> 37:36.300]  friend? They need a bidet.
[37:36.540 --> 37:38.820]  Everybody, tall, short,
[37:39.260 --> 37:40.240]  old, young,
[37:40.680 --> 37:42.500]  they all need
[37:42.500 --> 37:44.360]  bidets. We've all got the same
[37:44.360 --> 37:46.620]  butthole. It's the great equalizer.
[37:47.040 --> 37:48.280]  And with the Hello Tushy Bidet,
[37:48.540 --> 37:50.400]  you can wash your bum with
[37:50.400 --> 37:52.380]  fresh water for a way
[37:52.380 --> 37:54.420]  better clean than toilet paper. And that is
[37:54.420 --> 37:56.380]  true. You simply spray and pat
[37:56.380 --> 37:58.160]  dry. Attaches to your existing
[37:58.160 --> 38:00.220]  toilet with no electrician or plumber
[38:00.220 --> 38:02.200]  needed. Those people are expensive. Well, they're
[38:02.200 --> 38:04.200]  experts and they should be paid for their work, but
[38:04.200 --> 38:06.220]  they are expensive. And they are unnecessary
[38:06.220 --> 38:08.200]  when it comes to a Tushy Bidet. It cuts down
[38:08.200 --> 38:09.900]  on your toilet paper use by 80%.
[38:09.900 --> 38:11.920]  Think about the toilet paper money you're going
[38:11.920 --> 38:13.600]  to be saving. You could buy a boat.
[38:14.020 --> 38:15.900]  Make the restroom your best room
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.680]  with the complete Tushy system,
[38:17.760 --> 38:19.820]  including the Tushy Bidet attachment,
[38:20.240 --> 38:21.940]  ottoman, toilet brush, and
[38:21.940 --> 38:23.880]  Tushy stand and tissues. There's enough
[38:23.880 --> 38:25.940]  Tushy products to fill a Christmas tree.

[38:50.160 --> 38:51.860]  Can I tell you guys a
[38:52.360 --> 38:53.280]  funny, embarrassing
[38:53.280 --> 38:55.740]  thing that happened to me? Of course. Is it about your bike?
[38:56.480 --> 38:57.560]  Well, sort of, yeah.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.260]  So, I got bike problems.
[38:59.640 --> 39:01.840]  You gotta get into the bike stuff. All three of my
[39:01.840 --> 39:03.900]  bikes are down. Actually, my bike is back up.
[39:04.100 --> 39:04.900]  But, it's been a whole thing.
[39:05.400 --> 39:06.520]  I'm currently in the market.
[39:06.680 --> 39:08.560]  I'm currently shopping for a new bike
[39:08.560 --> 39:10.780]  right now. But yesterday,
[39:10.900 --> 39:12.840]  I did go for a bike ride and
[39:12.840 --> 39:14.800]  I've been having a problem
[39:14.800 --> 39:16.840]  with, you know,
[39:17.160 --> 39:18.920]  I guess like butt rash, sore butt from
[39:18.920 --> 39:20.540]  riding my bike too much. It's a common thing.
[39:20.840 --> 39:23.060]  And to combat it, some audience members recommended
[39:23.060 --> 39:24.860]  I buy some of those, I don't know what they're called, but those little bike
[39:24.860 --> 39:26.660]  shorts that, it's like a diaper
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.020]  sort of, but it's like padding on your
[39:29.020 --> 39:31.080]  butt. It's around your gooch
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.880]  and your butt, but it makes you have like a big
[39:32.880 --> 39:33.780]  dumpy bubble butt.
[39:35.300 --> 39:37.080]  Yeah, yeah. So I bought a couple
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.820]  pair and they're great. They actually
[39:38.820 --> 39:40.940]  work very well. And so I wear them every time I go
[39:41.520 --> 39:42.360]  on a bike ride.
[39:42.640 --> 39:44.620]  And the other day, I came home
[39:45.640 --> 39:47.000]  and as I was coming home
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.940]  the mailman was there and I needed to sign for something
[39:48.940 --> 39:50.380]  and the dog needed to go to the bathroom
[39:50.760 --> 39:53.080]  and then I realized like, oh shit, I need to go buy
[39:53.840 --> 39:54.880]  some stuff for the
[39:54.880 --> 39:56.900]  to prepare for the colonoscopy. I needed to buy some
[39:56.900 --> 39:58.940]  like a laxative that I didn't have yet. And I was like
[39:58.940 --> 40:00.820]  ah shit, I just grabbed my keys and I ran to the store
[40:00.820 --> 40:02.900]  and I was standing in line at the grocery store
[40:02.900 --> 40:04.460]  with like me and like, I don't know, like
[40:05.380 --> 40:06.580]  seven or eight
[40:06.580 --> 40:08.960]  like ladies that are just doing their daily shopping
[40:09.500 --> 40:10.820]  and I noticed one lady
[40:10.820 --> 40:12.860]  kind of giving me a dirty look and I'm used
[40:12.860 --> 40:14.240]  to it, right? Like, I get it.
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.300]  I get it, you know.
[40:16.880 --> 40:18.780]  Somebody, I saw, I recently
[40:18.780 --> 40:20.780]  did the RT podcast and somebody said
[40:20.780 --> 40:22.620]  I look like I do
[40:22.620 --> 40:24.380]  meth at a gas station. So it's like
[40:24.380 --> 40:26.140]  I get it, you know.
[40:27.120 --> 40:28.880]  And I'm covered in tattoos and stuff
[40:28.880 --> 40:30.780]  so I am used to getting
[40:30.780 --> 40:32.980]  like weird looks. But then another lady gave me kind of
[40:32.980 --> 40:34.740]  a weird look and I thought that's weird because this is Austin
[40:34.740 --> 40:36.700]  and this is my grocery store. I, you know,
[40:36.720 --> 40:38.720]  I come here all the time. And then I realized
[40:38.720 --> 40:41.020]  when I moved, oh, I've got my dumpy
[40:41.020 --> 40:42.920]  underwear on and I looked behind me
[40:42.920 --> 40:44.900]  and I just looked like I was walking around
[40:44.900 --> 40:46.640]  with a fucking, like I had taken
[40:46.640 --> 40:47.900]  seven shits in my pants.
[40:48.960 --> 40:50.500]  It was just like I had a hanging
[40:50.500 --> 40:52.680]  dumpy asshole and they were just
[40:52.680 --> 40:54.320]  and it was very noticeable.
[40:54.400 --> 40:56.700]  And I had completely forgotten that I was
[40:56.700 --> 40:58.520]  still wearing them because normally I take them off
[40:58.520 --> 41:00.740]  immediately. And, yeah.
[41:00.880 --> 41:02.300]  So I was
[41:02.300 --> 41:03.920]  a little embarrassed for that.
[41:04.220 --> 41:06.220]  I can't believe you're wearing those. That must be quite
[41:06.220 --> 41:07.940]  a contrast to all the tattoos.
[41:08.280 --> 41:10.740]  I feel like you've actually moved over
[41:10.740 --> 41:12.480]  from person who rides a bike to
[41:12.480 --> 41:14.800]  a cyclist. Oh, well, here's
[41:14.800 --> 41:16.520]  the thing. I definitely am not a cyclist.
[41:16.620 --> 41:18.640]  I was wearing them, Gavin, under my pants.
[41:18.820 --> 41:20.560]  That's the thing. I'm not going to wear them
[41:20.560 --> 41:22.640]  just the shorts and look
[41:22.640 --> 41:24.760]  like a bicyclist asshole. No, I was wearing
[41:24.760 --> 41:26.740]  them under a pair of pants, which is what made
[41:26.740 --> 41:28.760]  it look extra dumpy. It's like if I was
[41:28.760 --> 41:30.760]  just wearing the cycling shorts, then they would have looked
[41:30.760 --> 41:32.440]  at me and said, oh, he's a cyclist.
[41:32.740 --> 41:34.020]  He's just gross.
[41:34.620 --> 41:36.780]  What they saw was that guy took a bunch of
[41:36.780 --> 41:38.560]  shits in his actual normal pants.
[41:38.840 --> 41:40.320]  And it's just hanging.
[41:40.760 --> 41:42.600]  You know, it's just all like gathering at the bottom
[41:42.600 --> 41:43.960]  and it looks like...
[41:43.960 --> 41:45.920]  It looked like my butt was melting.
[41:47.380 --> 41:47.740]  I...
[41:48.400 --> 41:50.200]  So it's... How do they...
[41:50.200 --> 41:52.800]  They have more padding? Is that how they're helpful to you?
[41:52.800 --> 41:54.460]  Yeah, they have a ton of padding.
[41:54.480 --> 41:56.900]  They've solved the problem. Would you say it's a more
[41:56.900 --> 41:58.960]  effective solution than covering your ass
[41:58.960 --> 41:59.680]  in Tiger Balm?
[42:00.520 --> 42:02.840]  Yes. Okay. As long as we've
[42:02.840 --> 42:04.840]  moved forward from there. Yes, we're not going to do that
[42:04.840 --> 42:06.720]  again. We've definitely...
[42:07.560 --> 42:08.900]  We've learned some lessons there.
[42:09.320 --> 42:11.040]  That will not be happening again.
[42:11.980 --> 42:12.880]  I don't even know.
[42:13.160 --> 42:14.780]  Like, I have... For a guy who
[42:14.780 --> 42:16.880]  rides his bike six or seven days a week,
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.760]  I think I've ridden my bike three times
[42:18.760 --> 42:20.880]  in the past six weeks. Oh, wow.
[42:20.880 --> 42:22.840]  So what's the main issue with some
[42:22.840 --> 42:24.880]  of your bikes? Okay. So I
[42:24.880 --> 42:26.440]  have three bikes, right? I have my bike,
[42:26.740 --> 42:28.880]  I have Emily's bike, and I have Milly's bike.
[42:29.720 --> 42:30.880]  They're all the same bike.
[42:31.620 --> 42:32.840]  Mine's just a little bigger, right?
[42:33.400 --> 42:34.920]  And so... But they're all
[42:34.920 --> 42:36.920]  the same e-bike. So...
[42:36.920 --> 42:38.740]  I was riding mine
[42:38.740 --> 42:41.360]  on a trip, and...
[42:42.460 --> 42:43.040]  I was
[42:43.040 --> 42:43.820]  riding my bike
[42:44.580 --> 42:46.880]  the other day, and... Well, actually, I
[42:46.880 --> 42:48.860]  couldn't... Here's the deal. I was riding my bike about six
[42:48.860 --> 42:51.080]  weeks ago, seven weeks ago, and
[42:51.540 --> 42:52.900]  I popped a tire and
[42:52.900 --> 42:54.680]  a spoke. And I didn't have a spoke,
[42:55.140 --> 42:56.820]  and so I couldn't fix it. So I
[42:56.820 --> 42:58.760]  called to get it repaired, right? And then the guy
[42:58.760 --> 43:00.840]  was gonna take the guy about a week to come out and repair
[43:00.840 --> 43:02.860]  it. And... Which is fine, because I have
[43:02.860 --> 43:04.920]  two backup bikes. I have Milly's and Emily's, and they never ride
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.980]  theirs, right? Was the spoke a non-standard
[43:06.980 --> 43:08.900]  size? Everything about an e-bike
[43:08.900 --> 43:10.800]  is non-standard. So... And
[43:10.800 --> 43:12.780]  complicated. So...
[43:13.400 --> 43:14.900]  I'm like, no problem. I can wait.
[43:15.020 --> 43:17.000]  I have other bikes, right? So I just hop on Emily's
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.060]  bike. I start riding her bike. The second time
[43:19.060 --> 43:21.080]  I ride Emily's bike, I'm about
[43:21.080 --> 43:22.920]  seven miles from home
[43:22.920 --> 43:25.080]  and it just turns
[43:25.080 --> 43:26.780]  off. And
[43:26.780 --> 43:29.140]  an e-bike is an amazing
[43:29.140 --> 43:31.080]  piece of machinery when it's on.
[43:31.400 --> 43:33.100]  When it's off, it's
[43:33.100 --> 43:35.320]  an undriveable behemoth
[43:35.320 --> 43:37.060]  that weighs...
[43:37.060 --> 43:38.980]  It goes from being...
[43:38.980 --> 43:40.660]  I don't know, 12 ounces
[43:40.660 --> 43:42.300]  to 400 pounds.
[43:43.620 --> 43:44.820]  So wait, you can't...
[43:44.820 --> 43:46.400]  When the little motor dies,
[43:46.720 --> 43:48.700]  it doesn't just become a bike?
[43:49.080 --> 43:50.920]  Yeah, it becomes a very inefficient bike.
[43:51.320 --> 43:52.860]  Like, you can pedal it. You can work it.
[43:52.900 --> 43:54.900]  It's got gears. It's just heavy as
[43:54.900 --> 43:56.120]  sin. And it
[43:56.820 --> 43:58.620]  doesn't work well. It's a
[43:58.620 --> 44:00.440]  nightmare. I feel like
[44:00.440 --> 44:02.480]  you downplay the effectiveness
[44:02.480 --> 44:04.400]  of the bike when it's working.
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.700]  No, I downplay... And then when the bike doesn't work,
[44:06.780 --> 44:08.700]  it's like, oh my god, everything is broken.
[44:08.880 --> 44:10.660]  All of the stuff to assist is gone.
[44:11.160 --> 44:11.420]  Listen,
[44:11.420 --> 44:13.200]  the effectiveness
[44:13.200 --> 44:15.580]  is great when it's working. I don't think I'm downplaying it.
[44:15.680 --> 44:16.760]  It's just that when it's off,
[44:17.380 --> 44:19.460]  first off, you've got a fucking 25
[44:19.460 --> 44:21.560]  pound battery. The frame is heavy.
[44:21.620 --> 44:23.100]  It's three times as heavy as a normal bike.
[44:23.380 --> 44:25.420]  So it's just more work than a normal bike
[44:25.420 --> 44:27.280]  would be when it's not on. I get that.
[44:27.380 --> 44:29.660]  I have a normal bike. I'm actually gonna get it out of storage
[44:29.660 --> 44:31.380]  and start riding it again because I'm getting sick
[44:31.380 --> 44:32.620]  of these e-bikes. But I am still
[44:33.240 --> 44:35.460]  going further down the e-bike road. I'm not giving up on e-bikes
[44:35.460 --> 44:37.180]  because I love them. Anyway,
[44:37.340 --> 44:39.440]  so seven miles away from home, it
[44:39.440 --> 44:41.580]  goes dead. So I have to
[44:42.080 --> 44:43.640]  ride it slash walk
[44:43.640 --> 44:45.740]  it home. It's, for some reason,
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.280]  and I swear I'm not kidding,
[44:47.760 --> 44:49.600]  it is, any direction I ride
[44:49.600 --> 44:51.240]  from my house, coming back is uphill.
[44:51.480 --> 44:53.480]  It's like I live on the tallest, I live in the
[44:53.480 --> 44:54.700]  tallest point of Austin.
[44:55.380 --> 44:57.160]  So I ride this fucking, this
[44:57.160 --> 44:59.780]  hunk of shit, seven miles home,
[45:00.680 --> 45:01.560]  take it apart,
[45:01.760 --> 45:03.520]  the battery just won't turn on anymore. I look,
[45:03.600 --> 45:05.540]  there's scorch marks where the battery part connects.
[45:05.860 --> 45:07.700]  I'm like, oh, I must have blown the battery
[45:07.700 --> 45:09.860]  out or something. That sucks. Batteries,
[45:10.020 --> 45:11.460]  by the way, 500 bucks to replace.
[45:11.620 --> 45:13.160]  So I'm like, that fucking sucks.
[45:13.620 --> 45:15.700]  No worries, I'll just ride
[45:15.700 --> 45:17.960]  Millie's bike. Thank God I have a third bike, right?
[45:18.540 --> 45:19.980]  The next day,
[45:20.040 --> 45:21.600]  I ride Millie's bike, and
[45:21.600 --> 45:23.680]  six miles away from
[45:23.680 --> 45:25.800]  home, it dies in the
[45:25.800 --> 45:27.260]  exact same way.
[45:27.460 --> 45:29.020]  The battery exploded again?
[45:29.400 --> 45:31.740]  It just stopped working. I walk,
[45:31.840 --> 45:33.860]  push it home, take it apart,
[45:33.940 --> 45:35.700]  look, same problem, it's scorching.
[45:35.700 --> 45:37.740]  I call the company, they're like,
[45:37.780 --> 45:39.720]  yeah, these batteries are only rated for two
[45:39.720 --> 45:41.420]  years, so we can't replace them.
[45:41.960 --> 45:43.760]  I've had the bikes for a little over two years,
[45:43.840 --> 45:44.220]  of course.
[45:45.780 --> 45:47.640]  So I'm like, fuck. Well, that's okay,
[45:47.700 --> 45:49.440]  because tomorrow, the guy's coming
[45:49.440 --> 45:51.160]  to fix my bike.
[45:51.720 --> 45:53.400]  And then...
[45:54.180 --> 45:55.700]  Well, it wasn't tomorrow, it was actually
[45:56.280 --> 45:57.640]  I had... I'm getting it wrong,
[45:57.740 --> 45:59.600]  sorry, this is a while ago. This is like
[45:59.600 --> 46:01.600]  six weeks of nonsense. I think
[46:01.600 --> 46:03.680]  what had happened is I had bought another battery
[46:03.680 --> 46:05.720]  in advance, and so
[46:05.720 --> 46:07.780]  the other battery came, and I
[46:07.780 --> 46:09.520]  was able to put it back into Emily's bike,
[46:09.980 --> 46:11.360]  and the new battery,
[46:12.580 --> 46:13.540]  it just...
[46:13.540 --> 46:14.700]  I was riding about
[46:15.460 --> 46:17.760]  seven miles from home on the first
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.540]  ride on Emily's bike again,
[46:19.620 --> 46:21.780]  after I put the new battery in, and it died.
[46:22.420 --> 46:23.760]  And so I had to walk,
[46:23.840 --> 46:25.540]  push it home again.
[46:26.220 --> 46:27.620]  And six miles is no joke
[46:27.620 --> 46:29.360]  on foot. That's like a two-hour walk.
[46:29.800 --> 46:31.600]  It was about two to three hours,
[46:32.120 --> 46:33.780]  depending on... and it's all uphill,
[46:34.080 --> 46:35.660]  too. And it's also
[46:36.600 --> 46:37.760]  October and November,
[46:37.880 --> 46:39.740]  because this is about six weeks, it's October and
[46:39.740 --> 46:41.860]  November to Austin, so it ranges
[46:41.860 --> 46:43.600]  anywhere from 90 to 105.
[46:43.980 --> 46:45.500]  Right? It's hot as shit. Still.
[46:46.200 --> 46:48.020]  I am... I'm apoplectic
[46:48.020 --> 46:49.580]  at this point. I'm miserable.
[46:50.040 --> 46:51.880]  So this is my fourth time, third or fourth
[46:51.880 --> 46:53.580]  time the bike has... I think it's the third time
[46:53.580 --> 46:55.940]  it's broken on me. I get home,
[46:56.440 --> 46:57.880]  I look at it, it's not busted.
[46:58.040 --> 46:59.660]  I turn it on, it just turns back on, it's fine.
[46:59.660 --> 47:01.380]  It just needed to be like re-shocked awake,
[47:01.460 --> 47:03.640]  and I'm like, well that's fucking weird, hopefully that never happens again.
[47:03.760 --> 47:05.640]  And I think, I'll big brain this. I'll take
[47:05.640 --> 47:07.680]  the battery off Emily's, I'll put it on Millie's,
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.660]  different setup, and then we'll see if
[47:09.660 --> 47:11.500]  it happens again. The next
[47:11.500 --> 47:13.560]  day, I ride my bike, this time I'm
[47:13.560 --> 47:15.600]  about nine miles from home, and it
[47:15.600 --> 47:17.300]  turns off. Oh no!
[47:17.780 --> 47:18.940]  Yeah. And by the way,
[47:19.660 --> 47:21.480]  every single time this has happened,
[47:21.980 --> 47:23.340]  I need to be somewhere.
[47:23.760 --> 47:25.500]  I have a f***ing... I have a...
[47:25.500 --> 47:27.200]  I have an annual pass to record,
[47:27.200 --> 47:29.540]  or I have to pick Millie up from school,
[47:29.880 --> 47:31.240]  or she has a doctor's
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.340]  appointment. It's never a leisurely
[47:33.340 --> 47:35.180]  thing. I gotta like
[47:35.180 --> 47:37.140]  hoof it to get home. But I'm
[47:37.140 --> 47:39.040]  thinking like, I'm trying to...
[47:39.040 --> 47:41.140]  You're trying to rationalize it in your head by saying like, I'm getting double
[47:41.140 --> 47:43.160]  exercise today, right? Like, I'm getting in
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.140]  shape. Sure. Then I'm
[47:45.140 --> 47:47.260]  done. I'm like, I can't... I'm not gonna ride
[47:47.260 --> 47:49.080]  any of these piece of shit bikes anymore, I've been
[47:49.080 --> 47:51.300]  stranded four times. The guy comes to fix my bike.
[47:51.760 --> 47:53.180]  He fixes it, he does
[47:53.180 --> 47:54.180]  a bunch of work on it,
[47:54.800 --> 47:56.160]  I ask him about these
[47:56.160 --> 47:58.240]  electrical problems. In the process, waiting for him
[47:58.240 --> 48:00.140]  to come, I bought a whole new electrical
[48:00.140 --> 48:01.860]  system for my bike. And a new battery
[48:01.860 --> 48:03.680]  for Millie's other bike, right?
[48:04.160 --> 48:06.220]  And I bought a whole new electrical system for my bike because
[48:06.220 --> 48:08.180]  of the scorching and stuff, and I thought like, I'll just have...
[48:08.860 --> 48:10.140]  The guy comes, he fixes my bike,
[48:10.200 --> 48:12.160]  the other stuff. He won't touch any of the electrical stuff, he won't
[48:12.160 --> 48:14.240]  touch any of the e-bike stuff. Can't find anybody
[48:14.240 --> 48:16.140]  who'll touch any of the e-bike stuff, right?
[48:16.620 --> 48:17.980]  And I'm like, okay, whatever.
[48:18.340 --> 48:20.240]  So, uh, I get
[48:20.240 --> 48:22.160]  it all... I just don't put that stuff
[48:22.160 --> 48:24.220]  in. I just get the bike fixed, my bike works
[48:24.220 --> 48:26.300]  fine, the battery never died or anything on my bike,
[48:26.460 --> 48:28.260]  I was just trying to be preventative,
[48:28.340 --> 48:30.220]  right? I was trying to get ahead of a potential problem.
[48:30.560 --> 48:32.200]  Hop on my bike, rides like
[48:32.200 --> 48:34.360]  a charm, I drive seven miles
[48:34.760 --> 48:35.760]  and it doesn't
[48:36.460 --> 48:38.180]  explode. And I go, oh, my
[48:38.180 --> 48:40.200]  bike didn't turn off at seven miles, last time I did it at
[48:40.200 --> 48:42.380]  nine. I go nine miles, I'm fine.
[48:42.820 --> 48:44.240]  I go ten miles, I'm
[48:44.240 --> 48:46.140]  fine. And I go, okay, problem
[48:46.540 --> 48:47.980]  solved. I
[48:48.580 --> 48:50.060]  get about fifteen
[48:50.060 --> 48:51.460]  miles away from home.
[48:52.800 --> 48:54.400]  I go for half a marathon
[48:54.400 --> 48:56.200]  at this point. I know exactly how far
[48:56.200 --> 48:57.940]  away from home I am because I have a
[48:58.480 --> 48:59.900]  uh, because I have an app that, you know,
[48:59.940 --> 49:01.760]  records all my rides. That's how I made the fart that time.
[49:02.260 --> 49:04.000]  And, uh, I'm right at about fifteen miles
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.080]  from home and I'm on the hike and bike trail, and I'm
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.740]  zooming, and, uh,
[49:08.240 --> 49:09.780]  I have my headphones on so I don't hear anything,
[49:10.280 --> 49:11.960]  but something, like, jars the bike
[49:11.960 --> 49:14.020]  a little bit, and I look, and I feel something
[49:14.020 --> 49:15.980]  brush my leg, and I look over to see what
[49:15.980 --> 49:18.000]  brushed my leg, like a stick or something, and I
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.840]  see this twenty pound battery
[49:19.840 --> 49:22.020]  on my bike shooting
[49:22.020 --> 49:24.180]  about twelve feet
[49:24.180 --> 49:25.960]  out in front of me.
[49:26.080 --> 49:27.760]  It hits my leg and just keeps flying.
[49:28.020 --> 49:29.880]  Like, I gotta, it goes
[49:29.880 --> 49:32.000]  faster than the bike. Like, I gotta pedal to catch up
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.880]  with it. And then, and I'm like,
[49:33.940 --> 49:36.180]  I'm just in disbelief. And I look down
[49:36.180 --> 49:38.260]  and there's just a hole where the battery
[49:38.260 --> 49:39.900]  was before it exploded
[49:39.900 --> 49:41.640]  and violently
[49:42.440 --> 49:44.200]  ejected itself from my bike,
[49:44.300 --> 49:46.140]  clipping my leg, and it's
[49:46.140 --> 49:48.220]  just like, it just like hits
[49:48.220 --> 49:50.280]  the ground in a pile, I swerve
[49:50.280 --> 49:51.900]  off, I fucking, I put the bike down,
[49:52.020 --> 49:54.240]  I walk over, and I look, I pick up
[49:54.240 --> 49:55.560]  the battery, and
[49:55.980 --> 49:58.100]  it's just like, it's just like the
[49:58.100 --> 50:00.340]  bike exploded. I don't know how else to describe it.
[50:00.740 --> 50:01.820]  It's like, I go back
[50:01.820 --> 50:04.080]  to try to put it back together, everything
[50:04.080 --> 50:06.220]  is sheared. All the bolts are broken
[50:06.220 --> 50:07.940]  in half, the plastic
[50:07.940 --> 50:10.160]  casing is broken in half, the part that it
[50:10.160 --> 50:12.280]  connects to, where the, the scorching
[50:12.280 --> 50:13.880]  was on the other bikes, that part
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.180]  is melted to the battery.
[50:16.400 --> 50:17.640]  Like, the scorching part
[50:17.640 --> 50:20.040]  has physically melted, like
[50:20.040 --> 50:22.120]  hot melted, to the battery.
[50:22.340 --> 50:23.760]  I'm like, what the
[50:23.760 --> 50:25.520]  fuck? And so,
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.620]  I'm 15 miles from home,
[50:27.760 --> 50:30.000]  and I think, I can't believe this
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.620]  story. Well,
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.740]  I guess I better get to
[50:33.740 --> 50:35.780]  walking. And so, I
[50:35.780 --> 50:37.760]  figure out that bike without the battery
[50:37.760 --> 50:40.060]  is actually kind of light, like it's a little easier to ride,
[50:40.200 --> 50:41.500]  and so I'm like, ah, I can make this work.
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.480]  But I, the problem is, I don't know if this
[50:43.480 --> 50:45.440]  battery is savable or not,
[50:45.520 --> 50:47.480]  because the stuff is melted to it, but I feel like I can rip
[50:47.480 --> 50:49.520]  it off and see if maybe the battery itself is good,
[50:49.620 --> 50:51.540]  or maybe I can get it refurbed, because I know
[50:51.540 --> 50:52.840]  that these batteries can be refurbed,
[50:53.400 --> 50:55.380]  and it's like $550 to
[50:55.380 --> 50:57.480]  replace it. So I'm like, I gotta
[50:57.480 --> 50:59.440]  take this battery home with me, how
[50:59.440 --> 51:01.400]  the fuck do I do this? So I have to hold
[51:01.400 --> 51:03.640]  the battery in my left hand, it's like 20 pounds,
[51:03.980 --> 51:05.440]  hold the steering wheel with my
[51:05.440 --> 51:07.520]  right hand, and pedal home, you know,
[51:07.560 --> 51:09.360]  at one mile an hour, because this bike barely
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.080]  goes, and I get about
[51:11.780 --> 51:13.440]  three miles, and I'm like, I gotta
[51:13.440 --> 51:15.360]  throw this fucking battery in the river, or
[51:15.360 --> 51:17.380]  like, not the river, but I gotta throw this fucking battery in the woods
[51:17.380 --> 51:19.360]  or something, hide it, and try to come back
[51:19.360 --> 51:21.220]  for it. And I'm like, nah, I can't do that.
[51:21.580 --> 51:23.300]  It's too, like, I just gotta take this, I just
[51:23.300 --> 51:25.020]  fuckin' eat my medicine, just
[51:25.400 --> 51:26.900]  take my medicine and just get home.
[51:27.260 --> 51:29.340]  And I'm about seven miles into
[51:29.340 --> 51:31.320]  the trip of, uh, I have given up
[51:31.320 --> 51:32.920]  on riding, I'm exhausted at this point, because
[51:32.920 --> 51:35.440]  holding a 20 pound, heavy-ass
[51:35.440 --> 51:37.320]  battery that's, you know, 18
[51:37.320 --> 51:39.060]  inches long, and hard to
[51:39.060 --> 51:41.300]  like, there's no way to, like, I can't set it on
[51:41.300 --> 51:43.260]  anything, I don't have a backpack, there's no
[51:43.260 --> 51:45.060]  the only thing I can do is hold it in my hand,
[51:45.240 --> 51:47.320]  and try and steer and pedal uphill,
[51:47.780 --> 51:49.360]  and I'm, I'm like at muscle
[51:49.360 --> 51:51.380]  failure, pretty much. So I get off the bike
[51:51.380 --> 51:53.240]  and I, at about seven miles, and I start walking
[51:53.240 --> 51:55.380]  it, and I'm about two miles
[51:55.380 --> 51:57.320]  into the walk, and I
[51:57.320 --> 51:59.300]  have my headphones on, I'm just listening to like, I don't
[51:59.300 --> 52:01.260]  think I'm listening to like, uh, Polo G, or
[52:01.260 --> 52:02.860]  some really, really loud rap,
[52:03.380 --> 52:05.340]  and, uh, and I just sense
[52:05.340 --> 52:07.140]  something out of the corner of my eye, I'm on like, Lamar
[52:07.740 --> 52:09.340]  Boulevard, on a sidewalk, and I look over
[52:09.340 --> 52:11.340]  and I see a dude in a truck, like, screaming at me.
[52:11.660 --> 52:13.040]  And I'm like, what the fuck is that?
[52:13.260 --> 52:14.740]  And then I realize, it's my friend Joey,
[52:15.340 --> 52:17.200]  who has nothing to do with RT, uh, he's one of, uh,
[52:17.200 --> 52:18.800]  friend from my girlfriend. The guy from the boat?
[52:19.100 --> 52:21.100]  The boat guy? Yeah, the boat! It's the boat guy!
[52:21.420 --> 52:22.820]  Yeah! The fuckin' boat guy!
[52:23.420 --> 52:25.320]  Go, go now! My friend Joey! Yeah, boat guy!
[52:25.420 --> 52:26.980]  Boat guy Joey! And, uh,
[52:27.660 --> 52:29.460]  and he was just driving down the road,
[52:29.560 --> 52:31.220]  and he saw me walking a bike, and he's like,
[52:31.260 --> 52:33.400]  hey man, you need a fuckin' ride? And I was like, oh my
[52:33.400 --> 52:35.440]  God! And he gave me a ride home, so I only had
[52:35.440 --> 52:37.180]  to walk, like, 9 of the 15 miles.
[52:37.440 --> 52:39.340]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[52:40.340 --> 52:40.560]  Ha!
[52:41.200 --> 52:43.040]  But, so, in 5
[52:43.440 --> 52:45.340]  out of, I think, like, the last, I think out of like
[52:45.340 --> 52:47.320]  7 bike excursions,
[52:47.500 --> 52:49.120]  5 of them ended with me walking
[52:49.120 --> 52:51.260]  a minimum of 6 miles home.
[52:52.160 --> 52:53.420]  Uh, anyway, I get the
[52:53.420 --> 52:55.260]  bike home, I fuckin' am
[52:55.260 --> 52:57.120]  angry. I won't look at it for, like, 4 days.
[52:57.240 --> 52:59.340]  Then I finally, I look at it, I
[52:59.340 --> 53:00.700]  see everything that's broken,
[53:00.700 --> 53:02.520]  and I start callin' around,
[53:02.680 --> 53:04.320]  and nobody wants to touch this fuckin' bike.
[53:04.460 --> 53:05.500]  And I'm like, God damn it!
[53:05.800 --> 53:08.600]  I don't know if you guys know this about me, but I don't like
[53:08.600 --> 53:10.840]  workin' on stuff. Like, I grew up in Alabama,
[53:11.180 --> 53:12.920]  in a very, like, mechanically
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.440]  minded family,
[53:14.660 --> 53:16.760]  where, you know, I'd go, I'd drive home,
[53:17.020 --> 53:18.740]  I'd be like, I think something's wrong with my car,
[53:18.840 --> 53:20.540]  Grandpa, and he'd be like, go get the toolbox,
[53:20.900 --> 53:22.660]  and then my entire weekend would be me and my Grandpa
[53:22.660 --> 53:24.700]  fixin' somethin' on the car. And, which was a
[53:24.700 --> 53:26.760]  bonding experience for him, I hated it. I love my Grandpa.
[53:27.040 --> 53:28.560]  I just am not, I just, I don't like,
[53:28.560 --> 53:30.920]  I was a tool repairman in high school,
[53:31.140 --> 53:32.760]  I hated that, although I liked
[53:32.760 --> 53:34.540]  the job, I just hated, I just don't like,
[53:35.320 --> 53:36.480]  I just don't like fixin' shit.
[53:36.680 --> 53:38.140]  It just frustrates me, you know?
[53:38.520 --> 53:40.560]  And so, I try to avoid it if at all possible,
[53:40.760 --> 53:42.440]  and I couldn't, so I'm like, fuck it,
[53:42.500 --> 53:44.700]  and I have all the parts, so I sit down to fix my bike,
[53:45.120 --> 53:46.980]  it took me 12 minutes
[53:46.980 --> 53:48.780]  to fix this piece of shit bike, and now it works
[53:48.780 --> 53:50.640]  great. So what happened, though?
[53:50.640 --> 53:52.280]  Why'd it explode? Yeah.
[53:52.740 --> 53:54.380]  I don't know. Is it like a
[53:55.260 --> 53:56.960]  lithium vent on it or somethin'?
[53:56.960 --> 53:59.020]  I don't know. I don't know if it, like,
[53:59.080 --> 54:00.660]  if I just hit a...
[54:00.660 --> 54:02.940]  I don't think I could've hit a bump or anything
[54:02.940 --> 54:05.060]  hard enough to, to shear
[54:05.060 --> 54:07.160]  the, like, the screws in half.
[54:07.480 --> 54:08.620]  And to break the casing.
[54:09.120 --> 54:10.920]  But, and I was going downhill on a smooth ride,
[54:10.960 --> 54:13.080]  so I don't know if the bike, like, if the battery
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.100]  had like a, cause it was all melted and stuff,
[54:15.160 --> 54:16.780]  like, I assume that there was some sort of a vent
[54:16.780 --> 54:18.940]  where it, it exploded, and
[54:18.940 --> 54:20.920]  the force of that shot it off my bike, but
[54:20.920 --> 54:22.620]  it didn't do any structural damage to the bike,
[54:22.820 --> 54:24.700]  and since I had re-bought all the electrical stuff,
[54:24.700 --> 54:26.880]  I had to splice some wires, I had to re-
[54:26.880 --> 54:29.140]  I said 12 minutes, it probably took me more than that.
[54:29.280 --> 54:30.420]  Um, it may have taken, God.
[54:30.640 --> 54:32.080]  I just would love to see, like,
[54:32.440 --> 54:34.840]  can you imagine being a guy just jogging the other
[54:34.840 --> 54:36.660]  way, and then a bicycle shoots
[54:36.660 --> 54:37.600]  a missile at you?
[54:38.180 --> 54:40.520]  Yeah, it was like that, it was like a 20-pound missile
[54:40.520 --> 54:42.820]  shootin' at ya. Yeah, it's fuckin', it was brutal.
[54:43.520 --> 54:44.760]  So when did, when
[54:44.760 --> 54:46.720]  did this happen? How long has it been since you've had a
[54:46.720 --> 54:48.760]  bike issue? Did this just happen?
[54:48.900 --> 54:50.780]  Uh, I have ridden my bike twice
[54:50.780 --> 54:52.700]  since then. Okay. Uh,
[54:52.700 --> 54:54.600]  both times this week. So it was
[54:54.600 --> 54:56.620]  last week or the week before that this happened.
[54:56.780 --> 54:58.360]  You're not selling me on these e-bikes, I'll be honest.
[54:58.420 --> 55:00.740]  Two weeks ago this happened. Well, I'm not
[55:00.740 --> 55:02.200]  trying to sell you on this e-bike.
[55:03.160 --> 55:04.700]  You were before. I am gonna
[55:04.700 --> 55:06.680]  try to sell you on a different e-bike that I
[55:06.680 --> 55:08.720]  am currently shopping around for. I've been going
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.300]  to e-bike stores and talking to people
[55:10.300 --> 55:12.100]  and doing my research, and I've got some
[55:12.680 --> 55:14.620]  clues, I've got some good leads on some good
[55:14.620 --> 55:16.500]  new bikes, but, uh,
[55:16.700 --> 55:18.320]  yeah, it was, it was unbelievable.
[55:18.440 --> 55:20.200]  Now the bike works fuckin' great, of course.
[55:20.640 --> 55:21.820]  But, uh, I
[55:22.460 --> 55:24.080]  it might be the most frustrated I've been.
[55:24.260 --> 55:26.300]  I can't even tell you. Like, every time I get
[55:26.300 --> 55:28.120]  on my bike and I go like, today's the day, I don't get stranded.
[55:28.360 --> 55:30.400]  And then, just at the most inopportune
[55:30.400 --> 55:32.380]  moment when I'm just happy and, you know,
[55:32.440 --> 55:33.960]  head in the clouds, enjoying a ride,
[55:34.440 --> 55:36.200]  beautiful weather, listening to music, whatever.
[55:36.680 --> 55:37.600]  I was just like, suddenly
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.080]  it's like, ARGH! And you're like,
[55:40.140 --> 55:41.560]  aw, fuck, here we go again.
[55:41.900 --> 55:44.060]  You say the bike is working great. I assume
[55:44.060 --> 55:46.140]  if you were asked before it exploded
[55:46.140 --> 55:48.500]  if it was working great, you would have said yes.
[55:48.500 --> 55:50.540]  How do you know that the bike is, in fact,
[55:50.600 --> 55:52.440]  working great, and you're not just, like,
[55:52.460 --> 55:54.000]  moments away from...
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.940]  Well, like, everything's great until it explodes.
[55:56.200 --> 55:58.580]  Exactly! Yeah, no, totally, I have no idea.
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.540]  You're right. I'm saying it's
[56:00.540 --> 56:02.800]  working great as of this moment,
[56:02.920 --> 56:04.720]  but it might not be working great in an hour.
[56:04.840 --> 56:06.800]  I don't know. That's why I'm buying a new bike.
[56:07.200 --> 56:08.620]  That's why I'm getting another better bike.
[56:08.760 --> 56:10.660]  I'm getting, I'm paying more money to get a better bike.
[56:11.160 --> 56:12.340]  Uh, that lasts longer.
[56:12.500 --> 56:14.360]  The bikes I was looking at yesterday, the guy told me
[56:14.760 --> 56:16.380]  they should last 10 to 11 years
[56:16.380 --> 56:18.020]  before I have any of these kinds of problems.
[56:18.400 --> 56:19.840]  I explained every problem I had,
[56:20.240 --> 56:22.140]  it's like, we, yeah, we, uh,
[56:22.260 --> 56:23.880]  I think that there's a bike out there for me,
[56:24.180 --> 56:26.380]  I just, uh, I was just at my wits end
[56:26.380 --> 56:28.200]  with this motherfucker. I can't, I can't believe I had
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.180]  three bikes all break at the same time, and
[56:30.180 --> 56:32.400]  strand me as far as 15 miles
[56:32.400 --> 56:34.640]  away from home, five out of seven
[56:34.640 --> 56:36.520]  times. I'm amazed
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.940]  that you're willing to still ride the bike,
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.300]  because I don't, I think if I am sitting in a
[56:40.300 --> 56:42.400]  vehicle that explodes, I'm
[56:42.400 --> 56:44.400]  not getting back in that vehicle, even if
[56:44.400 --> 56:45.940]  I think I may have fixed it.
[56:46.400 --> 56:47.660]  I do not trust myself.
[56:48.240 --> 56:49.580]  That is how dire
[56:50.160 --> 56:52.000]  the need for bike riding is.
[56:52.480 --> 56:54.280]  What if you became a one-wheel guy?
[56:54.840 --> 56:56.400]  Ooh, now I
[56:56.400 --> 56:58.480]  feel like there's something physically about
[56:58.480 --> 57:00.000]  like, moving and the pedaling.
[57:00.320 --> 57:02.480]  Can you, can you ride
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.060]  your one-wheel from home to
[57:04.060 --> 57:06.280]  the office? I've not done that,
[57:06.320 --> 57:07.220]  but it has the range.
[57:08.540 --> 57:10.460]  I mean, I would be interested
[57:10.460 --> 57:12.820]  in the one-wheel as
[57:12.820 --> 57:14.820]  an addition to a really good
[57:14.820 --> 57:16.240]  e-bike, and a really good
[57:16.880 --> 57:18.620]  normal bike. I have one.
[57:18.720 --> 57:20.800]  I just need to pull it out of storage for when this kind
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.720]  of stuff happens again, because I've realized
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.320]  I don't want to stop riding.
[57:24.760 --> 57:26.720]  I still need to ride my bike. It's like,
[57:26.780 --> 57:28.820]  it's how I maintain my sanity. And so
[57:28.820 --> 57:30.760]  it's gotta happen. I gotta have a, so I need
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.780]  to have a backup. I thought I had three.
[57:33.040 --> 57:34.680]  I thought I had a bunch of backups, but turns out
[57:34.680 --> 57:35.100]  I didn't.
[57:37.700 --> 57:38.900]  I was gonna say,
[57:38.960 --> 57:41.000]  I feel like the last time we talked
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  about you and your bike issues, the story
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.020]  ended with you saying that you had ordered a
[57:45.020 --> 57:46.240]  bunch of spare parts.
[57:46.600 --> 57:48.080]  That was the spare parts.
[57:48.560 --> 57:49.780]  Just for extra shit.
[57:50.180 --> 57:52.640]  Your tale is like Goldilocks
[57:52.640 --> 57:54.940]  if she just fucked up every option every
[57:54.940 --> 57:56.680]  time. Like, it was just all three
[57:56.680 --> 57:58.140]  constantly broken.
[57:59.140 --> 58:01.080]  None of them were right. They were all broken
[58:01.080 --> 58:02.920]  in various ways. Do you have
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.600]  a bike, Andrew? No.
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.840]  No, I don't. Of any variety.
[58:07.280 --> 58:09.040]  E-bike, standard pedal.
[58:09.040 --> 58:11.180]  If you want to go somewhere
[58:12.020 --> 58:13.200]  that's walkable, but
[58:13.200 --> 58:15.340]  you need to get there quick, what do you go for?
[58:15.820 --> 58:16.920]  I leave early.
[58:17.800 --> 58:18.200]  Oh.
[58:18.720 --> 58:19.840]  That's pretty good.
[58:23.060 --> 58:25.040]  What an answer. There's never
[58:25.040 --> 58:27.200]  a situation in which I immediately need
[58:27.200 --> 58:29.180]  to be at a place
[58:29.180 --> 58:31.020]  where I couldn't just like, if I need a cab,
[58:31.120 --> 58:32.840]  I could call a cab or an Uber or whatever.
[58:33.500 --> 58:34.160]  It was similar.
[58:35.120 --> 58:36.480]  Yeah, you just drive.
[58:37.160 --> 58:37.520]  Guys,
[58:38.320 --> 58:40.280]  we talked about everything on my list.
[58:41.260 --> 58:41.980]  Did we?
[58:42.500 --> 58:43.780]  That's exciting. I'm glad we did.
[58:43.780 --> 58:44.220]  Not everything.
[58:46.080 --> 58:48.420]  There were three other things. I've invented a new
[58:48.420 --> 58:50.440]  blow dryer that I wanted to show you guys, but I need
[58:50.440 --> 58:51.340]  to make a prototype for it.
[58:51.340 --> 58:54.340]  No, you can't be like, I finished
[58:54.340 --> 58:56.240]  the list and then be like, I invented
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.300]  a new product. I just saw the part I missed.
[58:58.520 --> 58:59.960]  I invented a new product.
[59:00.180 --> 59:02.380]  I have to make a prototype for it. I'm very excited about it.
[59:02.440 --> 59:04.320]  It's for blow drying your hair on the go.
[59:04.320 --> 59:05.720]  I think you guys are going to love it.
[59:05.820 --> 59:07.520]  I think it's going to be a big seller for us.
[59:09.060 --> 59:10.580]  Also, one other thing,
[59:10.720 --> 59:12.420]  and this is a bit of a bummer.
[59:12.700 --> 59:14.220]  Two weeks ago, Andrew,
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.860]  our rookies played each other.
[59:16.080 --> 59:18.200]  They did. In the NFL.
[59:18.620 --> 59:19.260]  They did.
[59:19.520 --> 59:22.400]  The teams played. It was Najee Harris
[59:22.400 --> 59:24.240]  versus your guy,
[59:24.400 --> 59:24.980]  Justin Fields.
[59:27.100 --> 59:28.360]  My team won,
[59:28.620 --> 59:29.000]  of course.
[59:30.580 --> 59:32.420]  And it was a little
[59:32.420 --> 59:34.600]  touch and go for a while. I was watching it in bed
[59:35.220 --> 59:36.660]  and I decided
[59:36.660 --> 59:37.940]  at that moment,
[59:38.200 --> 59:40.420]  I talked about this earlier, I had been trying to let Najee
[59:41.080 --> 59:42.380]  work through his rookie season
[59:42.380 --> 59:44.100]  on his own without any help from me.
[59:44.380 --> 59:46.160]  But I was a little nervous going head to head
[59:46.160 --> 59:48.240]  against you, so for the
[59:48.240 --> 59:50.380]  first time in our magic
[59:50.380 --> 59:52.240]  competition, I did some
[59:52.960 --> 59:54.320]  incantations and some good luck
[59:54.320 --> 59:56.320]  spells. Did two different
[59:56.320 --> 59:58.660]  good luck spells multiple times
[59:58.660 --> 59:59.320]  and
[59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.940]  you know,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.820]  they won. Steelers won.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.460]  So I think that
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.240]  the first time I
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.300]  felt the need to inject magic
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.000]  into the competition, it worked.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.440]  I gotta let you know, I'm using
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.400]  magic. I hate that Gavin
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.960]  is currently winning in this bet.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:17.680]  McCorkle!
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.540]  That is the worst part of this.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.340]  And I also hate that we didn't... I feel like if we all
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.300]  would have known that his name was actually Michael
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.360]  Jones and the McCorkle thing, I feel like
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.340]  that would have been the guy.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.880]  It's a clear sign to like.
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.340]  Also, no magic.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.840]  Yeah, no magic.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.260]  It's upsetting on several levels.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.260]  I'm still... I believe in Justin Fields.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.280]  You should believe in Harris, Geoff. He looks
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.320]  phenomenal. He looks great.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.260]  It's just gonna be tough.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.360]  It turns out the real magic is
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.980]  in the McCorkle. It is.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.940]  Did you see that
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.580]  when they played, the announcers
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.480]  made a big deal of the fact
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.540]  talking about... I guess Najee Harris grew up
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.580]  homeless. And they told this story
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580]  about how when he went to college, he slept
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.100]  on the floor for a few weeks because he
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.220]  didn't feel comfortable with it.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.880]  And then after the game, he was like,
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.800]  where did you get that from?
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.420]  It never happened. He's like, I slept
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.640]  in my bed. Why would I not sleep in my bed?
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.060]  What are you saying?
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.480]  I did not sleep on the floor at college.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.740]  But I'm upset. I'm upset that
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.460]  I don't feel like
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.040]  You better start doing some magic, man.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.840]  I've been pushing magic
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840]  really hard.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.480]  I feel like the fact that
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.680]  Justin Fields became starter when he did,
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.860]  I would like to take some credit
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.060]  for that. I feel like I deserve a little bit.
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.180]  I think that's fair.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.020]  Putting potions and magic and all that
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.640]  towards... What kind of magic
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640]  have you caused?
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.880]  It feels weird for me saying I deserve
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.820]  credit for it, but for putting the ball in motion,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.540]  for putting those who are capable
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.940]  at casting such things in the direction
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.400]  of him playing,
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.700]  I feel like some credit is deserved.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.660]  I feel like this show, let's not say
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.860]  me, this show, the people
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.600]  of Chicago,
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.560]  okay, well, for most of the show,
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.300]  80% of the show
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.820]  deserves some level
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.720]  of credit for Justin Fields starting
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.360]  when he did. Andy Dalton
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.740]  being on the bench. All I'm saying is
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:17.640]  hiring
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.860]  people, enlisting
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.660]  help on the magic front I think is
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.540]  super valid and useful, but
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.660]  if you haven't already,
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.400]  throw some
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.920]  magic his way via
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.860]  yourself. Pick up that wand.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.060]  Do some spells.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.960]  I think I might
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.700]  get into that. It's worth a shot.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.400]  I'm gonna look into that. Andrew.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.740]  Yes. Have you noticed that your
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.540]  redemption year is coming to an end?
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:44.640]  What do you mean?
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.640]  It's coming to a close.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.780]  No, well,
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.480]  this is a weird...
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.180]  Is it a redemption year or a redemption season?
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.760]  No, it's not, because it was the end
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.040]  of the first year of the podcast.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.720]  So the redemption year, year two,
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.740]  doesn't end in 2021.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.340]  It ends in, when, June?
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.600]  I think the first week of June.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.680]  So we're halfway through redemption.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.780]  We're just started redeeming.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:09.220]  Gavin.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.260]  Wasn't it on your birthday that we started redeeming?
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.800]  No, it was
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.580]  the start of the podcast.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.880]  It was year two when we did the year the show
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.740]  has been going on for a calendar year.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.400]  Year two. Redemption year.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:22.960]  Yeah, Nick asks
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.400]  a great question. What's left to redeem?
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.820]  Still, obviously,
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.880]  the marathons. The thing that needs to
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.080]  happen at some point.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.300]  And I think that's...
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.720]  I feel like I've gotten redemption on most
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.160]  things at that point. I think that kind of covers it.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:38.820]  Yeah?
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.760]  Yeah, I think pretty good about a lot
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.380]  of the things that...
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.940]  I mean, I feel like, I don't know if you guys have any...
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.580]  What do you think needs redeemed
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:50.080]  at this stage? I'd say that's about it.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.040]  I'd say it's kind of the only loose thread
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.640]  at this point. I redid the salad.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.100]  I think the salad cream 2.0
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.880]  turned out great.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.900]  I redeemed the chocolate.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.260]  I redeemed the...
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.960]  the soda. Tried that again.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.780]  I can't think of
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.660]  a single thing you're missing here.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.920]  I think I covered
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.920]  everything. Hey, I noticed that
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.040]  Nick is the one that told us to stop
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.960]  talking. Does that mean Eric's gone?
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.180]  Eric seems to have left a long time ago.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.880]  I assume that Eric's internet dropped
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.020]  once again. He has been gone for a while.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.700]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.060]  That's beautiful. Because
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.120]  earlier today, I left
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.060]  a meeting early. The one where they were pranking me.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.120]  I left a meeting early because
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.240]  I sat down to get ready for this podcast
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.260]  with about 30 minutes to go and had
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.240]  an audio conflict. And I told
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.000]  him in that meeting, I was like, I'm going to leave this meeting early
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.160]  to fix my setup. And he was like,
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.000]  Oh my God, you and your fucking setup again.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.140]  And I'm like, I know. It won't be a problem
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.300]  for the episode. I'll get it fixed. And I did.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.400]  But where's our fearless
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.200]  producer? Having tech
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.380]  problems again.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.400]  Ay-ay-ay. Should we call him?
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:02.260]  No. Then we'd
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.240]  have to talk to him. Tsk-tsk, as
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:04.720]  Nick said.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:06.840]  We could go on
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.440]  forever. There's nobody to stop.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.660]  Well, we don't want to. Nick's got a
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.680]  family. That's true. You know what, you're right.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.140]  I do have
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.560]  one question, though. I feel like
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.520]  a couple weeks ago, a couple episodes ago,
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.780]  who knows when it was, we dropped
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.720]  a pretty big thing in
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.200]  the face
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.320]  being officially represented by a superhero.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.340]  What was that guy's name again?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.560]  Something sportsman? Marty Baxter?
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:32.260]  Yeah, but his character.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.000]  I just want to point out the fact
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.320]  it's not, we haven't actually, we
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.440]  don't want to sign a superhero, we want to sign
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.220]  a guy that has arthritis, who
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.360]  is possessed by an alien. Yes. Technically
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.540]  not a superhero who we're getting at this stage.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:46.300]  And what is his
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.380]  superhero name again? The Smashing
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.100]  Sportsman. Smashing Sportsman.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.080]  That's right. So, I just
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.260]  wonder, where are we on that? We talked about
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.480]  it, and then I think we forgot about it.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.180]  I would love an update on it. I don't know
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.200]  how to push that ball forward internally.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.980]  That is something that I
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.740]  don't know. You'd have to.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.320]  Sounds like it's on Eric.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.040]  If only he was here.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.180]  Well, if
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.780]  you're related to
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:14.180]  a distant relative of the Smashing Sportsman
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.300]  or you know his family in some
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.660]  way, Marty Baxter, or
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.240]  maybe if you're the president of DC Comics
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.160]  or Warner Brothers and you want to
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.100]  hit us up and allow us to
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.080]  use that character as our
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.880]  official superhero, we promise
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.600]  we promise to do good.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.420]  Now we should probably throw it to
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.960]  minor league fan Jack Pattillo to tell us
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.780]  what's coming up on next week's F*** Face.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.080]  On next
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.040]  week? What do you mean? Your idea
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.720]  was that he'd look at the
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.740]  images for... what
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.080]  are you talking about? Like, we would record
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.780]  next week, and we would
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.820]  let him read the
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.380]  chat, and then he would
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.960]  record based on that
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.080]  and we'd stick it on this one.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.660]  So we're just gonna edit this in.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.180]  No, he's right.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.840]  Like, imagine what we did today, but next week.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.060]  We came up with the idea in this one, so we
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.660]  can't do this one. Okay.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.140]  As long as we're always one ahead
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.240]  we can... But we don't even know
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.000]  is what's weird about it. We don't know what's
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.740]  coming next week. That's why I feel
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.780]  comfortable about this. But Jack does.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.820]  Jack does that. You're right.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.160]  Or he will. And then next week they can tune in and see
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.860]  how accurate it was. You're right.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.940]  I think that's a fantastic idea.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:25.800]  We'll try it out.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.740]  We'll experiment with it.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.100]  on the next episode of F*** Face.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.140]  I gotta
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.820]  drink so much gross water.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.060]  Good luck with your colon.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.100]  46 ounces
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.340]  in the next, like, hour.
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.300]  Is that a lot? How much is an ounce?
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:08.580]  It's not just water.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.180]  It's about an ounce.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.720]  How much is an ounce?
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.600]  How many cups in an ounce?
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.940]  Like a diet Coke. Like a Coke can's like
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.000]  12 ounces, right? 16 ounces, something like that.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.040]  Okay, so like a Coke
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.760]  So you need to drink, what, like three
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.320]  cans of Coke, essentially?
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.060]  Uh, I think probably closer to four.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.960]  But it's not just water. It's like
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.300]  a solution that's gross.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.080]  I remember when I got x-rayed
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.860]  I was told it would taste like a milkshake.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.980]  And that's one of the most, like, the worst
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.360]  lies anyone's ever told me.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.280]  I've never felt more betrayed.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.100]  Especially as a child who had never had a milkshake before.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.980]  I was like, I'm gonna get to f***ing try a milkshake
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.980]  today. I'm gonna get some lab work
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.580]  done. I'm so excited.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.420]  I remember the person saying
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.260]  when I got there, being like, yeah, you're gonna have to drink
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.440]  the solution. And as a kid, I remember
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.400]  replying, yeah, I heard it tastes like a milkshake.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.520]  Can't wait. And just seeing the
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.340]  confusion on their face.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.660]  Like, oh, somebody has clearly lied to you.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.540]  And registering, like, that was
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.380]  a weird facial response to
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.580]  one of the worst drinks I've
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.840]  ever had. It was a traumatic experience.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.600]  Maybe that's why I've never had
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.420]  a milkshake to this day. Maybe we're
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.240]  going deep into the core of why.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.100]  I don't know.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.200]  How can you drop that on us when we're
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.300]  ending the episode? I feel like we've talked about
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.220]  the fact I've never had a milkshake.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.280]  I'm sure it's been
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.060]  mentioned in a list of things I haven't done.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.160]  Nick doesn't remember it. I don't.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.020]  Gavin, do you remember him ever saying he's never had a milkshake?
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.160]  No. I feel like I always dwell on the eggs
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.260]  and meatballs, but milkshake
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.300]  as well? I'm gonna make you dinner
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.340]  when I come to stay.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.820]  I'm gonna cook you a three-course meal.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.360]  I'm gonna give it to you at the bar. Okay.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.280]  You cook the meal.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.520]  I will design the toilet table to make it
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.200]  look really nice. You have eggs
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.680]  and meatballs and milkshakes.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.260]  And pickles, right?
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.700]  Is that pickles?
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.280]  I've tried pickles.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.820]  It's not a big... yeah.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.120]  Not a big pickle guy.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.280]  Maple syrup. Bananas suck.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.660]  I tried them again and went in with an open mind.
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:07.460]  Have you ever had a banana split?
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:08.500]  No.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.100]  Goddamn, man.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.360]  Would that elevate
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.140]  the banana? Because I'm putting in other things
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.300]  so I could see it. Because I don't have an issue with the taste.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.360]  It's purely
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.540]  the texture.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.640]  I mean, it's pretty fucking fantastic.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.500]  But you've never had a milkshake, so you won't have anything to...
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.600]  We need... Gavin's right.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.140]  We need to spend some time with you.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.100]  Putting stuff in your mouth.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.800]  Because all the time I've spent with you so far, I've apparently forgotten about.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.340]  So I need some memorable time with you.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:35.740]  That's...
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.140]  I don't know how to... that feels like an insult.
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.400]  That feels like a dig.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.600]  That feels like a dig on the way out.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.220]  Nah. I'm gonna cook you dinner.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.880]  I thought you were about to say
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.800]  I'm gonna cook you a milkshake, which would be
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.400]  alarming.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.500]  I truly don't know how they work.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.540]  I'm gonna say this right now, Andrew.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.120]  This is an honor that you should...
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.380]  and you should feel as such.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.560]  Gavin lived with me off and on
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.540]  for years.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.740]  Over the span of seven or eight years.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.080]  But he legit lived with me for a couple
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.520]  of years, like day in day out.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.180]  And I don't think he
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.040]  ever cooked anything
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.200]  for me once the entire time.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.000]  He certainly ate a lot of food I cooked for him.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.060]  Well, I kept an eye on the meat
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.040]  once while you were grilling.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.800]  So what I'm saying is
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:23.860]  savor it.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.700]  It's not often you get
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.060]  world famous Gavin Free
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:28.620]  to cook you a meal.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.340]  You threw a stick at his head when he was sun tanning
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.020]  in the front lawn once. I feel like that also
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.300]  might have affected...
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.340]  Certainly did not, and that was toward the tail end.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.060]  And if I did throw a stick, it might have
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.120]  been because the motherfucker never lifted a finger to help cook.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.760]  I like you going full OG on this.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.000]  I didn't do it, but let me explain if I did
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.200]  how I would have done it.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.060]  Here's why I
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.020]  didn't do it. Here's why I would have done it.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.140]  I didn't do it, but I have plenty
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.120]  of motive, and let me explain to you why.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.160]  Let me tell you all the reasons that
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.120]  I rightfully... You should give me
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.200]  credit that I didn't do this, because this
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.140]  is all of the ammo I have for
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:12.860]  why I should have.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.060]  Woo! Holy
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.120]  shit. Good couple of eps.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.300]  Well, this one was pretty good. The last
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.420]  one I wasn't crazy about, but
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.120]  we've done it again.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.060]  I was so off.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.160]  Oh, you should have heard Geoff before
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.820]  you got there, Gavin. Oh boy.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.900]  So, did you piss him
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.220]  off before we started? Is that what happened?
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.280]  I quit the podcast before we started.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.840]  Yeah, it was bad. He was not
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.220]  happy.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.580]  It was just like the exact...
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.920]  It was a perfect confluence of things.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.820]  Like, I...
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.740]  You know, I feel
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:50.100]  like hammered shit, and
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.840]  I mean, I just haven't eaten a meal
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.780]  in days, so I'm loopy. I know
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.720]  my blood sugar's all fucked up. I'm
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.780]  thirsty... or not thirsty. I'm just
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.860]  fucking... I'm like, full of liquid.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.500]  I'm literally
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.740]  like, shooting piss out of
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.700]  my butthole like a fire hose.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.460]  It's very uncomfortable.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.200]  I spent two and a half hours
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.840]  just on the toilet this morning
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.600]  before I even got up, so I'm just so
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.680]  diminished. And then, I sit down.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.520]  I have to have a quick 30-minute meeting about
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.780]  merch. I realize I don't have a lot prepared because I wasn't
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:21.860]  feeling... I was in bed until the moment I got up
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.760]  to have that meeting. And I
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.880]  sit down, and while I'm having the meeting,
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.040]  I'm setting up audio for the podcast,
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.640]  and suddenly, none of it works.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.680]  Even though all I do on this computer
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.960]  is Slack and this podcast.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.040]  I don't even go in this room unless
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.100]  I'm podcasting. So I don't know
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.920]  how it all got... well, yeah.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.980]  Well, it's a problem. I never wanted this
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.020]  to be my office because I knew when it became my office, I wouldn't want
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.880]  to come in here anymore because I would associate it with work,
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.800]  and unfortunately, the pandemic made that happen.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.100]  Before the pandemic, this was the...
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.540]  I spent all my time here.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.880]  Post-pandemic, I look at it, and I see work.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.000]  Anyway, so I sit
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.700]  down, and then all that shit's broken,
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.920]  and then immediately I'm like, alright, I'm gonna have to leave
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.940]  this meeting early so that I can fix
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.360]  this so it doesn't affect the podcast.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.000]  Eric's immediately yelling at me about how my stuff's always broken,
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.640]  and I'm like, got it. Definitely
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.120]  needed to hear that right now.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:11.860]  Then I'm like, as I'm leaving, I think,
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.640]  oh, I'm leaving Andrew
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.780]  and Eric in a meeting
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.800]  without me. They're
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.720]  gonna fuck with me. And then I
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.960]  sit down, I finally get it all working,
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.000]  I sit down to start, and then they start
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.200]  recounting how I had already agreed to sign
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.040]  hundreds of items for
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.120]  something that we hadn't talked about, and I was just
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.940]  like, not doing it right now. I was
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.020]  like, I'm not having it, I'm not doing it, I'm not doing the
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:36.040]  gaslighting thing, I'm barely hanging in
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.980]  here, and they doubled down, and
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.860]  so I was just like, I'm done! I'll be back at two
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.960]  when the podcast starts. I just put my headphones down, and I
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.980]  left, and I came back. Well, in that case, I'm impressed
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.940]  you managed to pull it back mid-episode.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:47.900]  That makes it even
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:48.820]  better. Yeah.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:50.860]  More than anything,
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.640]  it was just energy and nausea, you know?
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.980]  My stomach improved a little
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.060]  bit, and then I wasn't feeling so sick.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.400]  Should we end this episode?
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.300]  Yeah, what time are we playing Halo today?
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.860]  I feel like Geoff just gave
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.840]  me a huge list of reasons why not
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.520]  to play Halo with Geoff right now.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.700]  What does that mean? Oh, you're sick.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.980]  You're under the... this is a serious
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.200]  thing.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.200]  What else am I gonna do? I got nothing
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.500]  but time to sit and stare at the wall.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.480]  You wanna do 7?
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.140]  That's 5 for you, Andrew.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.420]  Uh... okay.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.300]  Maybe. Maybe I'll be there.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.120]  Maybe I'll be there. Maybe 8?
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.420]  Well, when's convenient for you? All three of us wanna play.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.880]  7's better for me.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.280]  Okay, I'll do 8.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.040]  I wanted to play at 7.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.080]  You can play at 7.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.400]  You know what? It's okay. No, no, no.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.340]  I'll make it work at 8. No, you play at 7.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.760]  You guys have a great time.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.900]  I can show up at 8. Why is this so aggressive?
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.960]  Here's the deal.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.360]  Here's the deal.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.760]  Here's what's going on.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.700]  Here's what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.940]  Here's what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.120]  Uh, Andrew doesn't wanna play video games with me.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.160]  It's clear. No, I would love to
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.660]  play video games with you. I'll be there
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.960]  at 8 to play with whoever wants to play.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.300]  I love you guys.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.620]  Irrespective of how you feel about me,
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.920]  I love this podcast. I love you,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.860]  Nick. I love you, comment leavers.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.700]  I love you, regulation listeners.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.080]  I love Halo.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.640]  Some would say that Halo is the reason
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.880]  we're all here talking right now.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.420]  But if you feel the need to exclude me
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.360]  from it further, that's fine too.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.340]  Thanks for listening. See you guys next week.
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.060]  See you tonight.
