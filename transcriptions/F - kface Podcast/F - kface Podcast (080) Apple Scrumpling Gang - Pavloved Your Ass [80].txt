[00:36.760 --> 00:40.340]  And action. Ooh, action.
[00:40.340 --> 00:41.980]  That's exciting. It's like a movie.
[00:42.580 --> 00:46.680]  Geoff, what is a trailer for a movie that you're like,
[00:46.760 --> 00:48.040]  this trailer looks fucking great.
[00:48.160 --> 00:49.780]  And then you saw the movie and you were disappointed.
[00:50.580 --> 00:52.560]  Uh, hold on. I'm not recording.
[00:53.180 --> 00:54.740]  What the f- what is- Great.
[00:55.720 --> 00:58.200]  Hey, who is actually recording at three?
[00:58.720 --> 01:00.040]  As soon as you joined.
[01:00.300 --> 01:01.780]  I was recording before three.
[01:01.880 --> 01:04.520]  It's three and I'm recording. It's three o'clock right now.
[01:04.660 --> 01:07.740]  You are late to the- No, it is not three on the dot.
[01:07.880 --> 01:10.080]  I think somehow being last to join,
[01:10.080 --> 01:11.200]  I was the only one on time.
[01:11.560 --> 01:15.400]  Yes. Hey, Gavin, a hundred percent agree with you.
[01:15.580 --> 01:18.580]  Well, I mean, everybody is technically still on time because it's still three
[01:18.580 --> 01:21.940]  o'clock, but I was prepping the video that I need to send you guys.
[01:21.940 --> 01:23.220]  We were here and not recording.
[01:23.580 --> 01:25.180]  Gavin is the one.
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.620]  Gavin is the one who was on time.
[01:26.700 --> 01:28.720]  Thank you, Gavin, the professional.
[01:29.820 --> 01:30.740]  Cool. Congratulations, Gavin.
[01:30.800 --> 01:31.880]  You're the professional. Thanks, man.
[01:32.040 --> 01:37.560]  We all hope to someday aspire to be like you.
[01:37.560 --> 01:45.060]  You are quite possibly the pinnacle of what a podcaster could hope to achieve
[01:45.060 --> 01:50.860]  in terms of professionalism and talent, in terms of, I don't know, tone,
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.900]  efforts, general demeanor. It really doesn't get better than you.
[01:57.020 --> 01:59.120]  So, Gavin, please show us how it's done.
[01:59.500 --> 02:00.600]  I wasn't the one saying it.
[02:01.480 --> 02:03.640]  I don't think he- I think he already did.
[02:03.720 --> 02:04.700]  I think the act was done.
[02:04.800 --> 02:06.620]  He did show us how it was done by being on time.
[02:06.620 --> 02:08.560]  I don't think there's anything to go beyond that.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.280]  I know he was on time.
[02:10.400 --> 02:12.720]  I know he was on time because I was here when I saw him come in.
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.320]  That's true. Also on time.
[02:14.700 --> 02:18.020]  I was prepping a video because I knew the size would be too big to send you guys
[02:18.020 --> 02:21.320]  through Discord and it would be a whole kerfuffle in the middle of the episode.
[02:21.620 --> 02:23.740]  So I was sending in a different way
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.500]  while you guys were talking about Colin Quinn's film prowess.
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.980]  He knows a lot about movies. I was surprised.
[02:31.680 --> 02:33.080]  Of course, Colin Quinn's a great guy.
[02:33.280 --> 02:34.320]  Very, very funny comedian.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.540]  Very funny comedian.
[02:35.540 --> 02:36.820]  Also enjoyed his book.
[02:36.920 --> 02:38.540]  His specials are unique.
[02:39.060 --> 02:42.320]  He does more like essays than I'd say like traditional stand up.
[02:42.400 --> 02:42.880]  It's fascinating.
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.060]  Like he tells more of like their historical specials.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.620]  But anyway, I want to know the trailer thing.
[02:49.000 --> 02:49.960]  Geoff, do you have a trailer?
[02:50.020 --> 02:51.220]  He's a great storyteller in general.
[02:51.360 --> 02:53.580]  Also one of the best guests in the history of The Howard Stern Show.
[02:53.740 --> 02:56.260]  He had a story about fucking a cat that you would not believe.
[02:57.640 --> 03:01.580]  He also had a story about fucking an old lady in a hallway and having her fall
[03:01.580 --> 03:03.820]  down and hit her head and leaving her there for dead.
[03:03.820 --> 03:04.580]  Wait, what?
[03:04.940 --> 03:05.940]  Yeah, he told on The Howard Stern Show.
[03:06.420 --> 03:08.960]  Oh, like she fell in the hallway.
[03:09.260 --> 03:12.200]  She fell and hit her head and he felt bad and he left.
[03:12.680 --> 03:14.440]  And he has no idea what he accidentally killed her.
[03:14.900 --> 03:17.260]  I don't know. I guess then she's dead and he's a murderer.
[03:19.040 --> 03:21.200]  Anyway, he knows a lot about film. He does.
[03:21.500 --> 03:25.140]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[03:25.400 --> 03:28.160]  I believe this is episode 80, if I'm correct.
[03:28.460 --> 03:32.780]  Which puts us, I want to say, in the back half of season two, year two.
[03:33.240 --> 03:33.820]  Is that correct?
[03:34.440 --> 03:35.540]  I think we've kind of gone over it.
[03:35.580 --> 03:38.840]  There's no real measuring system for what I think there is.
[03:38.880 --> 03:39.940]  We just need to sit down and figure it out.
[03:40.020 --> 03:43.220]  We're approaching a number of episodes that no one can pitch in baseball.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.520]  That's true.
[03:45.580 --> 03:48.400]  I think what's the fastest pitch recorded?
[03:48.500 --> 03:50.580]  And it's probably in like over a hundred.
[03:50.700 --> 03:53.540]  I think I want to say one hundred and two or so.
[03:53.640 --> 03:56.500]  Really? I was thinking I was going to guess like one hundred ten would be my guess.
[03:56.760 --> 03:57.740]  No, I don't think that high.
[03:58.180 --> 03:59.580]  Has anyone thrown one in a vacuum?
[04:00.560 --> 04:01.340]  What do you mean?
[04:02.900 --> 04:04.680]  Like, has anyone thrown one at a vacuum cleaner?
[04:06.760 --> 04:08.240]  I don't understand. Like, why?
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.260]  Why would they have done that?
[04:09.860 --> 04:12.040]  Well, it says no air resistance, so you can throw it real fast.
[04:12.580 --> 04:13.500]  Oh, OK.
[04:14.080 --> 04:16.160]  That's I feel like you took some leaps there.
[04:16.380 --> 04:18.360]  I wasn't I wasn't with you. I was lost.
[04:18.760 --> 04:21.240]  I was thinking about I've never seen someone throw a vacuum.
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.360]  There was a guy who got thrown out of the game, I want to say.
[04:25.400 --> 04:26.600]  Or maybe he disagreed with it.
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.100]  I think it was he disagreed with what was called a strike.
[04:29.500 --> 04:31.160]  And then the coach started fighting
[04:31.160 --> 04:36.100]  with the umpire and the player walked out of the field, went down, grabbed a garbage
[04:36.100 --> 04:40.000]  can and then placed it behind the plate and pointed at the umpire and said, that's you.
[04:40.460 --> 04:41.060]  You're garbage.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.940]  There has been a garbage can on the field.
[04:44.040 --> 04:45.600]  I've never seen a vacuum on the field.
[04:45.800 --> 04:50.980]  You sent a clip to the group chat the other day about it was a American football
[04:50.980 --> 04:55.560]  game where a guy kicked the football, but apparently it somehow never happened before.
[04:56.100 --> 04:59.740]  Well, no, I didn't I didn't send the I feel like this is just you being Eric sent
[04:59.740 --> 05:04.600]  I sent I sent a clip of a guy getting hit in the head with a football after a kick.
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.780]  And then there was another kick
[05:05.780 --> 05:07.900]  discussion later that I don't think was a video.
[05:08.160 --> 05:10.620]  I thought Eric put something in the slack.
[05:10.920 --> 05:11.700]  What are we? Yeah.
[05:11.740 --> 05:15.440]  We're talking about the Doug Flutie drop kick is what we're talking about.
[05:15.500 --> 05:17.240]  I assume Gavin didn't understand why that was.
[05:17.520 --> 05:19.260]  First of all, he's a throwing man, Gavin.
[05:19.320 --> 05:21.120]  He's not a kicking man. His job is to throw.
[05:21.520 --> 05:22.080]  He's a quarterback.
[05:22.480 --> 05:24.420]  They're making it sound like it's the first
[05:24.420 --> 05:28.140]  time anyone had dropped the ball, bounced it off the floor and kicked it over the.
[05:28.540 --> 05:30.820]  Yeah, it was. It was in the modern NFL.
[05:30.980 --> 05:32.120]  It literally was.
[05:32.580 --> 05:34.280]  It's just not a thing that kick people do.
[05:34.380 --> 05:36.140]  Why would you why would you drop the ball and kick it?
[05:36.220 --> 05:37.320]  Like, especially if you're a quarterback.
[05:37.920 --> 05:38.980]  Nobody's prepared for that.
[05:39.640 --> 05:40.620]  Quarterbacks don't kick the ball.
[05:41.200 --> 05:42.300]  What was their way of doing it?
[05:42.320 --> 05:44.960]  Like they thought the other team thought they were going to, like, run with it.
[05:45.020 --> 05:46.040]  But then he kicked it. Yeah.
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.360]  I think the other team assumed because I think it was they positioned like they
[05:50.360 --> 05:52.160]  were going for two. I'm not fully aware.
[05:52.240 --> 05:52.940]  I'm just assuming.
[05:53.240 --> 05:56.780]  And instead of actually running and like throwing the ball to score it,
[05:56.780 --> 05:58.820]  they scored off of a drop kick,
[05:59.000 --> 06:02.700]  which if you drop the ball down, bounce and kick it between the uprights.
[06:02.920 --> 06:03.600]  That's a point.
[06:04.140 --> 06:07.980]  So I think like nobody was prepared for the play because it's both a QB and they're
[06:07.980 --> 06:10.080]  in a position in which they would typically go for two.
[06:10.420 --> 06:12.800]  But they ran a play that would score one.
[06:13.040 --> 06:16.120]  But sometimes like if it's fourth down, they just kick it.
[06:16.560 --> 06:18.940]  Yeah, but it's first the kicker does it.
[06:19.020 --> 06:21.480]  It's the kicker's job and they don't kick it that way.
[06:21.560 --> 06:24.920]  They have like a guy that catches it and holds it and places it.
[06:24.920 --> 06:27.980]  And then the kicker just kicks it off the ground from the guy that's holding it.
[06:28.240 --> 06:30.120]  The kicker is never bouncing it off the ground.
[06:30.360 --> 06:30.920]  I think it is.
[06:30.980 --> 06:34.320]  I think there's room for error if you're trying to purposely bounce the ball and
[06:34.320 --> 06:36.280]  kick it yourself. I think that's way harder.
[06:37.040 --> 06:39.000]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's a football.
[06:39.160 --> 06:39.960]  It's not a sphere, man.
[06:40.020 --> 06:41.920]  You know, you can't predict exactly how it's going to bounce.
[06:42.060 --> 06:43.520]  Plus, Lace has got to be out.
[06:43.800 --> 06:46.600]  Gavin, according to your favorite movie of all time, Lace is out.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.520]  Lace is out. Lace is out.
[06:49.260 --> 06:53.680]  Also, it's just like a human tripod essentially is the other guy's job.
[06:53.680 --> 06:54.960]  Why would you remove the tripod?
[06:55.240 --> 06:56.620]  Just stabilizes it for you.
[06:56.660 --> 06:58.280]  Nice and easy shape of the ball.
[06:59.100 --> 07:00.680]  They also it's like a different sports.
[07:00.800 --> 07:02.140]  I don't know the rugby comparison.
[07:02.640 --> 07:04.480]  I think the balls are shaped differently, too.
[07:04.960 --> 07:05.680]  The Hangover, Andrew.
[07:06.140 --> 07:07.000]  What about The Hangover?
[07:07.600 --> 07:09.420]  It was a good trailer and it was a terrible movie.
[07:09.820 --> 07:10.800]  I like the trailer a lot.
[07:10.840 --> 07:13.140]  I thought it was going to be funny and then I didn't like the movie at all.
[07:13.460 --> 07:15.360]  Really? Like you would say you hated The Hangover?
[07:15.760 --> 07:16.380]  Oh, yeah.
[07:16.560 --> 07:17.680]  I don't understand.
[07:17.980 --> 07:19.880]  I don't understand why people like that film.
[07:20.280 --> 07:21.740]  I think the first one's quite good.
[07:21.740 --> 07:23.040]  Yeah, I enjoyed the first one.
[07:24.020 --> 07:26.080]  Yeah, I haven't watched it since it came out.
[07:26.180 --> 07:28.600]  I don't have really like any interest in revisiting it.
[07:28.760 --> 07:32.960]  But I got in an argument with Brandon Farmahini one time who told me at work,
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.040]  who told me that it was the funniest movie in like the last decade and was so
[07:37.040 --> 07:39.520]  full of jokes, he didn't understand how I could not like it.
[07:39.540 --> 07:42.140]  So I asked him, tell me your favorite joke from the movie.
[07:42.240 --> 07:45.500]  And he just looked at me for about five minutes and then said, oh, and then walked away.
[07:45.860 --> 07:48.240]  Well, yeah, I think that's a terrible call to call it a joke.
[07:48.320 --> 07:50.420]  Like when I think of a joke movie,
[07:50.420 --> 07:52.220]  I think it's something like Naked Gun.
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.380]  I think of like those kind of like that where the joke per minute is absurd.
[07:57.160 --> 08:01.000]  The Hangover is like, and I was kind of because it's a little bit of a mystery.
[08:01.000 --> 08:01.800]  It's a comedy.
[08:02.100 --> 08:05.220]  It kind of brought Mike Tyson back in a way.
[08:05.560 --> 08:07.140]  I will say there's a moment in the trailer
[08:07.140 --> 08:10.100]  that is funnier edited than it was in the movie.
[08:10.120 --> 08:13.220]  And that was the Mike Tyson, Phil Collins bit.
[08:13.620 --> 08:15.940]  Yes. Where in the in the trailer it's like
[08:15.940 --> 08:18.340]  doo doo doo doo, and then he socks him at the end of that.
[08:18.340 --> 08:20.660]  But in the movie, it's not as funny.
[08:21.340 --> 08:22.540]  I could you know what?
[08:22.600 --> 08:24.380]  I think the worst part of the Hangover was for me.
[08:24.500 --> 08:28.460]  And this is like a very strange complaint they put out back on the 360
[08:28.460 --> 08:31.100]  when random movies would come out that were big.
[08:31.220 --> 08:33.660]  They would put out profile picture packs
[08:33.660 --> 08:36.840]  where it was just faces of the characters typically.
[08:37.260 --> 08:39.860]  And there are people so many people use the baby.
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.560]  There is a baby from the Hangover is one
[08:41.560 --> 08:43.640]  of them, and the people that did it thought they were really funny.
[08:43.720 --> 08:44.620]  And I was just sick of it.
[08:44.640 --> 08:47.500]  It was a popular gamer picture for a stretch of time.
[08:47.500 --> 08:48.780]  The baby with the glasses.
[08:49.300 --> 08:50.400]  Yours is Danny DeVito.
[08:51.060 --> 08:52.960]  One of yours is Danny DeVito.
[08:53.020 --> 08:54.860]  What was for what? What movie was he?
[08:55.820 --> 08:57.580]  No, yours was. Oh, yeah.
[08:57.600 --> 08:59.860]  But I pulled that. That was a choice I made.
[08:59.940 --> 09:01.860]  That was that was a custom pull.
[09:01.980 --> 09:04.320]  Yeah, I'm not hating necessarily on anyone that does that.
[09:04.680 --> 09:07.100]  It's just there was a I don't know.
[09:07.340 --> 09:09.860]  And what's the word I'm looking for?
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.920]  Like a belief of calm. I don't know.
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.440]  I just don't if you I'm fine with you
[09:14.440 --> 09:17.440]  liking the Hangover, liking the Hangover to the point where it's your gamer
[09:17.500 --> 09:22.460]  picture is a step too far, or I think it's an interesting choice.
[09:23.080 --> 09:24.580]  We talked about it briefly when we were playing Halo.
[09:24.700 --> 09:27.260]  But my most excited I was from a trailer
[09:27.260 --> 09:31.460]  to the least impressed I was with a movie was the Tuxedo with Jackie Chan.
[09:32.560 --> 09:34.900]  It's such a weird...
[09:34.900 --> 09:35.980]  I was a teenager.
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.700]  I was really loved Rush Hour.
[09:38.840 --> 09:40.760]  I was getting into like, oh, like, who am I?
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.520]  Rumble in the Bronx, like all of his early American type stuff.
[09:45.920 --> 09:46.680]  Tuxedo came out.
[09:46.680 --> 09:50.900]  I thought as a teenager, I thought, oh, shit, I was so excited.
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.540]  And I didn't see it at the cinema.
[09:52.660 --> 09:53.320]  I bought it on DVD.
[09:53.400 --> 09:55.280]  I was like, oh, I've wasted my money on it.
[09:56.980 --> 09:58.880]  Wait, did you purposely not?
[09:58.960 --> 10:00.220]  I didn't know that you didn't.
[10:00.300 --> 10:01.660]  Did you not see it in theaters?
[10:01.660 --> 10:03.720]  Because you're like, I'm going to love this movie so much.
[10:03.740 --> 10:05.480]  I'm going to want to watch it multiple times.
[10:05.480 --> 10:07.280]  I'm going to save my money and buy it then.
[10:07.560 --> 10:08.200]  Why didn't you see it?
[10:08.500 --> 10:10.420]  I just didn't get to go that much when I was a kid.
[10:10.740 --> 10:12.760]  It's like, OK, it's like a big event when I went.
[10:12.900 --> 10:14.600]  So I assume at the time I was busy
[10:14.600 --> 10:17.240]  seeing like Lord of the Rings and stuff to make it count.
[10:17.360 --> 10:19.400]  But it was like not even a rental scenario.
[10:19.560 --> 10:21.060]  You're like, I know I'm going to love this.
[10:21.220 --> 10:23.020]  I want the extra features.
[10:23.540 --> 10:24.100]  I bought it.
[10:24.200 --> 10:26.780]  It was probably like 15 quid on DVD.
[10:27.700 --> 10:29.900]  My reaction was the same as yours.
[10:30.040 --> 10:30.500]  I don't know.
[10:30.620 --> 10:33.520]  Gavin genuinely may have been the biggest, like,
[10:34.160 --> 10:36.120]  tuxedo fan based on trailer on the planet.
[10:36.380 --> 10:39.100]  I don't think anyone may have anticipated that movie more than Gavin.
[10:39.640 --> 10:41.680]  It's such a weird movie to be excited about.
[10:42.040 --> 10:44.000]  I don't think Jackie Chan was bad in that either.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.140]  I think it was just not any good.
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.780]  I feel like I very rarely would say
[10:47.780 --> 10:50.580]  that Jackie Chan was the problem of the thing that he was in.
[10:51.120 --> 10:51.720]  I agree with that.
[10:51.780 --> 10:55.560]  Like, I can't think of like, wow, Jackie Chan really fucked that movie up.
[10:55.760 --> 10:58.520]  Like, when did Jackie Chan ever phone it in, right?
[10:58.720 --> 10:59.380]  I don't think so. Yeah.
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.720]  No, I think it's a consummate professional.
[11:02.240 --> 11:04.500]  Jackie Chan is the Gavin free of movies.
[11:04.580 --> 11:06.200]  He's the podcasting Gavin free of movies.
[11:07.640 --> 11:09.940]  I'll say it because we all know it's true.
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.560]  He's the creme de la creme.
[11:11.640 --> 11:13.980]  He's the he's the one that we all aspire to be.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.980]  As soon as Gavin told me that,
[11:16.180 --> 11:20.880]  I immediately went and watched the trailer for the tuxedo and watching it
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.100]  in the context of imagining Gavin watching it for the first time,
[11:24.140 --> 11:27.900]  being like, holy fuck, this looks good, was very funny.
[11:28.180 --> 11:29.260]  They killed James Brown.
[11:29.640 --> 11:30.580]  For those who've ever seen it,
[11:31.020 --> 11:35.320]  I think the plot of the movie was that he gets Jackie Chan powers,
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.480]  but from a suit, and I think I remember that there's water
[11:39.480 --> 11:42.340]  that makes people thirsty, and that's all I can remember from that film.
[11:42.340 --> 11:46.260]  So it's a James Bond movie, but not a James Bond movie.
[11:46.340 --> 11:49.200]  There's a guy that is like James Bond and he's British.
[11:49.460 --> 11:52.220]  But it turns out that all of his abilities come from his suit.
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.060]  Jackie Chan is a taxi driver that befriends this guy.
[11:57.200 --> 11:59.740]  I also haven't seen this movie in a long time, so this could be completely wrong.
[11:59.800 --> 12:03.860]  But I think he befriends the guy and then somehow ends up with the suit
[12:03.860 --> 12:07.220]  because the guy dies and then he kills James Brown.
[12:07.780 --> 12:09.480]  And then Jackie Chan kills James Brown.
[12:09.580 --> 12:11.100]  And they do a dance number because he has
[12:11.100 --> 12:15.720]  to perform instead of James Brown, because the suit has a bunch of abilities to it.
[12:15.860 --> 12:18.760]  It's like a stealth suit, but it also has like funky mode,
[12:18.880 --> 12:21.540]  I feel like is what they display so he can like dance and perform.
[12:21.700 --> 12:23.060]  I'm going to be honest with you right now.
[12:23.240 --> 12:25.760]  I haven't seen the movie since like the early 2000s.
[12:25.840 --> 12:28.120]  The way you're describing it, I really want to watch the movie.
[12:28.200 --> 12:29.180]  It sounds awesome.
[12:29.700 --> 12:30.800]  It sounds really good.
[12:31.440 --> 12:32.760]  I went to watch it.
[12:32.980 --> 12:35.020]  I refused to pay five dollars to write it.
[12:35.500 --> 12:38.220]  I was going to do that last night and I was like, $4.99.
[12:38.500 --> 12:39.220]  I can't do it.
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.840]  It was $3. I'd do it for $5.
[12:42.560 --> 12:43.580]  Why don't we have a watchalog?
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.120]  We can do a watchalog. I'd watch it in that context.
[12:46.460 --> 12:50.480]  I just I forgot James Brown was in it and that they weirdly kill James Brown.
[12:50.700 --> 12:53.240]  And then I wanted to go because in the trailer it happens.
[12:53.360 --> 12:54.600]  It's like, no way they actually do that.
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.020]  It's an unfortunate thing where you go to the movie wiki
[12:58.020 --> 13:02.340]  and whoever wrote the plot synopsis deemed that scene not worth explaining.
[13:02.600 --> 13:05.660]  There is no mention of James Brown in the movie wiki for that thing.
[13:06.280 --> 13:08.440]  So if somebody if somebody watches the tuxedo,
[13:08.440 --> 13:12.100]  feel free to please include the James Brown section of that film from the wiki
[13:12.100 --> 13:14.100]  because he's listed in the cast.
[13:14.200 --> 13:17.500]  But there is no mention him in the plot breakdown of the tuxedo.
[13:19.160 --> 13:20.060]  It's a dumb movie.
[13:20.480 --> 13:23.100]  He made a lot of those movies like the do you remember the medallion?
[13:23.500 --> 13:25.400]  That was one of those Jackie Chan era.
[13:25.920 --> 13:27.940]  Not very good. American.
[13:28.780 --> 13:30.980]  I know I've seen it. I couldn't tell you anything about it.
[13:31.460 --> 13:32.980]  I don't think I've seen that one.
[13:33.540 --> 13:35.000]  Eric just said we're a Jackie Chan podcast.
[13:35.140 --> 13:35.920]  I'm OK with that.
[13:35.920 --> 13:37.960]  Jackie Chan, some great movies.
[13:38.500 --> 13:40.240]  Rush Hour, the Jackie Chan adventures.
[13:41.140 --> 13:41.920]  Mr. Nice Guy.
[13:42.180 --> 13:45.680]  I would argue the greatest blooper reel of all time.
[13:46.000 --> 13:46.660]  Rush Hour 2.
[13:46.980 --> 13:50.760]  I think that's probably the greatest post credit blooper reel in movie history.
[13:51.140 --> 13:52.780]  Where Chris Rock, not Chris Rock.
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.000]  Damn it. Where Chris Tucker looks out the window and says,
[13:55.660 --> 13:57.660]  damn, he ain't going to be in Rush Hour 3.
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.500]  I think that might be the funniest post like blooper line of all time.
[14:02.560 --> 14:03.500]  I remember that killing.
[14:03.740 --> 14:05.780]  That may have been the biggest laugh in the theater.
[14:05.920 --> 14:06.940]  And that was a will receive.
[14:07.180 --> 14:10.400]  I remember as a child watching that in a pack theater.
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.600]  And that line killing myself included just is a great line.
[14:15.100 --> 14:16.000]  Very funny blooper.
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.660]  They don't do those anymore.
[14:17.900 --> 14:20.280]  I feel like I once the last time you saw a blooper reel.
[14:20.580 --> 14:22.160]  I think they're in all of Jackie Chan's films.
[14:22.600 --> 14:23.740]  I will. I think they're staple.
[14:23.840 --> 14:26.700]  I literally I watched the tuxedo's blooper reel last night on YouTube.
[14:26.880 --> 14:28.840]  I didn't watch the movie, but I at least watched that.
[14:28.940 --> 14:30.320]  You have to watch a Jackie Chan blooper.
[14:31.580 --> 14:34.880]  Geoff, I was waiting for the subject to change away from Jackie Chan.
[14:35.540 --> 14:39.280]  I, I, I, I'm not up to date on my Jackie Chan content.
[14:39.380 --> 14:40.440]  So I was just letting you guys go.
[14:40.740 --> 14:42.260]  I don't know. Don't throw to me.
[14:42.700 --> 14:43.900]  I had nothing to do with that.
[14:43.980 --> 14:45.940]  It's you. You guys are having the Jackie Chan discussion.
[14:46.120 --> 14:48.540]  I couldn't name a Jackie Chan movie post
[14:49.420 --> 14:51.700]  the one he did with Jet Li, whatever that was called.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  What about the foreigner?
[14:53.560 --> 14:54.460]  I never saw that.
[14:54.660 --> 14:55.680]  I thought that looked interesting.
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.380]  Directed by the guy that made Golden Eye starring Pierce Brosnan
[15:00.920 --> 15:02.020]  and Jackie Chan.
[15:02.180 --> 15:04.120]  I've never seen it, but I haven't.
[15:04.120 --> 15:05.100]  It looked dark.
[15:05.180 --> 15:06.940]  It was like, this is gritty Jackie Chan.
[15:07.120 --> 15:08.860]  His family, I think, dies in a bombing.
[15:09.200 --> 15:10.460]  And then he's like, I'm going to get revenge.
[15:10.620 --> 15:12.620]  I wonder if there's a blooper reel on that one.
[15:12.940 --> 15:15.100]  There can't be a blooper reel on the foreigner.
[15:15.440 --> 15:16.300]  There's no way.
[15:16.360 --> 15:17.740]  Oh, that would be awesome.
[15:18.300 --> 15:21.960]  I don't I don't think Pierce Brosnan plays like a spy type character.
[15:22.080 --> 15:24.420]  I think he's just like an executive who's a villain.
[15:24.580 --> 15:26.240]  But I could be wrong. Haven't seen it.
[15:27.700 --> 15:28.400]  Nice, Eric.
[15:29.380 --> 15:31.660]  Did you see No Way Out, Gavin?
[15:32.780 --> 15:33.520]  What was that?
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.560]  Have you seen No Way Out or have you seen No Way Out, Geoff?
[15:37.160 --> 15:40.480]  The movie with Bridget Fonda, the remake of La Femme Nikita?
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.960]  No. Well, no, I don't think so.
[15:43.260 --> 15:47.400]  Maybe. It's an Owen Wilson movie that came out in like 2016.
[15:47.840 --> 15:50.700]  No Way Out. Kevin Costner, Sean Young.
[15:51.260 --> 15:52.900]  No, that's not. Am I?
[15:53.520 --> 15:55.280]  No Escape. That's what I mean.
[15:55.400 --> 15:57.700]  No Escape. Not No Way Out. No Escape.
[15:58.120 --> 15:59.280]  I knew No was in the title.
[15:59.780 --> 16:01.860]  It's just Pierce Brosnan plays Bond again.
[16:01.860 --> 16:04.540]  It's like his last, I'd say, role as Bond.
[16:05.080 --> 16:05.440]  Or he doesn't.
[16:06.080 --> 16:09.440]  He can't flat out say he's Bond, but it's like they constantly tease
[16:09.440 --> 16:11.680]  the fact that he's like an older, burnt out Bond.
[16:12.140 --> 16:13.380]  Like Sean Connery in The Rock.
[16:14.400 --> 16:15.200]  Yes, exactly.
[16:15.200 --> 16:16.260]  Like Sean Connery in The Rock.
[16:16.820 --> 16:18.460]  Same type of same type of deal.
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.680]  Do you know this is going to be a really weird, like just a random question.
[16:23.880 --> 16:25.920]  Geoff, do you what's your favorite Mission Impossible movie?
[16:26.100 --> 16:27.280]  Let's set it up that way first.
[16:27.660 --> 16:29.980]  Oh, well, that's easy.
[16:29.980 --> 16:31.380]  That's not even a question.
[16:31.800 --> 16:32.880]  Really? Mission Impossible 3.
[16:33.160 --> 16:34.600]  Mission Impossible 3 is one of the best movies ever made.
[16:34.980 --> 16:36.260]  Thank you. Mission Impossible 3 is one of the best.
[16:36.720 --> 16:38.020]  Mission. First off, it's not a movie.
[16:38.140 --> 16:39.480]  It's a film. Mission Impossible.
[16:39.720 --> 16:43.360]  You can't call Mission Impossible 3 a movie because it's that it's it.
[16:43.420 --> 16:46.580]  That would be an it's an insult to what that that piece of art is.
[16:46.700 --> 16:48.520]  It is a film in every way.
[16:48.660 --> 16:49.940]  Who is the girl at the beginning?
[16:50.660 --> 16:51.320]  It's Keri Russell.
[16:52.520 --> 16:54.080]  Are you just dropping trivia?
[16:54.220 --> 16:57.540]  Are you testing him to confirm that he is a Mission Impossible 3 fan?
[16:57.860 --> 16:59.680]  That question is how Geoff lost his car.
[17:00.180 --> 17:02.560]  Really? That's why Gavin owns his car.
[17:03.120 --> 17:04.740]  Oh, that was the bet.
[17:05.060 --> 17:05.700]  I got it was a Keri Russell.
[17:06.500 --> 17:10.740]  Wow. I don't remember who I thought it was, but I I didn't think it was Keri Russell.
[17:11.220 --> 17:13.200]  Didn't you think it was like Anne Hathaway or something?
[17:13.340 --> 17:14.120]  And I was like, you're an idiot.
[17:14.220 --> 17:17.840]  No, it was somebody that made sense, but it wasn't Keri.
[17:17.900 --> 17:19.720]  It wasn't. I can't remember who it was.
[17:20.560 --> 17:22.760]  Michelle, did you mistake Michelle Monaghan?
[17:22.840 --> 17:23.840]  Because she's in that as well.
[17:23.880 --> 17:25.100]  And I feel I could kind of play that.
[17:25.440 --> 17:26.940]  No, no, we don't.
[17:27.120 --> 17:29.060]  I it doesn't matter.
[17:29.060 --> 17:29.980]  You'll never know.
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.120]  The important thing is that I know that I haven't owned my car in 15 years.
[17:35.220 --> 17:37.060]  Why? Why? Why do you ask, by the way?
[17:37.140 --> 17:37.840]  Why do you ask?
[17:37.880 --> 17:38.840]  Well, I glad you were.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.280]  This is a conversation we had.
[17:40.380 --> 17:43.280]  I agree. Mission Impossible 3 is the best one by far.
[17:43.340 --> 17:47.000]  And I think it's largely due to the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman.
[17:47.380 --> 17:51.380]  I think one of the great movie villains in that and that menacing is shit.
[17:51.580 --> 17:53.220]  He's fantastic. He's awesome in it.
[17:53.700 --> 17:55.980]  There are three perfect moments in that film.
[17:56.020 --> 17:57.680]  If you'd like, I can go through them with you.
[17:58.360 --> 18:01.940]  The first perfect moment in that film is when they're breaking into the Vatican
[18:04.540 --> 18:07.980]  and Ving Rhames and Ethan Hunt have the conversation
[18:07.980 --> 18:09.440]  where he goes, what's up with you?
[18:09.620 --> 18:11.520]  And Ving Rhames goes, nothing, what's up with you?
[18:11.840 --> 18:12.760]  And he goes, nothing.
[18:13.080 --> 18:14.600]  That's just perfectly acted.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.240]  There's the scene when he's infiltrating the big building.
[18:17.320 --> 18:17.980]  I think it's in India.
[18:18.260 --> 18:19.660]  And they're like talking about the plant.
[18:19.720 --> 18:21.860]  And then it just cuts to him the outside of the building.
[18:21.920 --> 18:24.160]  And it cuts to him screaming, I'm not going to make the extraction.
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.380]  And he jumps out a window.
[18:25.380 --> 18:28.060]  And you have no idea what happened in that building,
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.800]  but it went very fucking wrong.
[18:29.940 --> 18:31.140]  That was an awesome scene.
[18:31.340 --> 18:33.660]  And then at the end, when he's with the chick and he's like,
[18:33.700 --> 18:35.740]  if you don't kill me, I'm going to die.
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.020]  That's a great moment, too.
[18:37.660 --> 18:39.380]  All perfect moments from a perfect film.
[18:39.740 --> 18:42.880]  It's great. It starts out, I think, one of the great film intros as well.
[18:43.060 --> 18:43.920]  You don't know what's going on.
[18:43.980 --> 18:46.020]  This character normally in power is in a bad spot.
[18:46.860 --> 18:47.940]  Doesn't look like Kerry Russell.
[18:48.080 --> 18:48.980]  Apparently it is.
[18:51.200 --> 18:54.220]  Do you remember Philip Seymour Hoffman's character's name?
[18:54.220 --> 18:55.600]  Ambition Impossible three.
[18:57.260 --> 19:02.840]  No. For like how iconic that character is in my mind of like a great villain.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.200]  Very forgettable. His name is Owen.
[19:05.560 --> 19:09.320]  I think it's the least menacing name to menacing character
[19:09.320 --> 19:11.060]  and film history, possibly.
[19:11.520 --> 19:14.340]  There's nothing memorable or evil about the name.
[19:14.500 --> 19:16.300]  Oh, and this is so not intimidating.
[19:17.080 --> 19:18.580]  Yeah, the rabbit's foot. That's right, Nick.
[19:19.260 --> 19:22.620]  That is this the whole thing of the what is it like an atomic bomb
[19:22.620 --> 19:25.220]  or something? The rabbit's foot he's pursuing.
[19:25.880 --> 19:28.040]  I don't really remember what the rabbit's foot was.
[19:28.280 --> 19:29.340]  It was I don't know that we ever.
[19:30.240 --> 19:31.920]  Yeah, I don't know that we found out, did we?
[19:32.080 --> 19:35.100]  Well, it's in it was wasn't a thing that there was this insane shot
[19:35.100 --> 19:39.340]  where Dr. Manhattan dies and he drops the briefcase
[19:39.340 --> 19:42.560]  and the thing rolls out like perfectly into the camera in focus.
[19:42.560 --> 19:43.900]  And it was like, wow, how did they do that?
[19:44.380 --> 19:45.420]  You mean Billy Crudup?
[19:46.080 --> 19:47.360]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[19:47.720 --> 19:49.480]  I assume that's who he means. Yeah.
[19:49.700 --> 19:50.680]  Was he not Dr. Manhattan?
[19:50.680 --> 19:51.980]  No, he was. I think he was.
[19:52.260 --> 19:53.500]  I just couldn't remember. I just couldn't remember.
[19:53.720 --> 19:54.660]  Do you want to bet a car on it?
[19:55.340 --> 19:56.960]  No, no. I bet Geoff's car on it.
[19:57.460 --> 19:59.340]  My Mission Impossible betting days are over.
[19:59.840 --> 20:00.820]  Still paying off the last one.
[20:01.260 --> 20:03.160]  I want to. How are you doing, Geoff?
[20:03.240 --> 20:06.560]  Because last time we recorded this, you were you're in a bad spot.
[20:06.800 --> 20:07.540]  You're getting ready.
[20:07.580 --> 20:09.940]  I was at 36% in the first recording.
[20:10.140 --> 20:13.360]  I got up to about 42 by the second recording.
[20:13.480 --> 20:15.340]  And you were like half of where I was in chocolate.
[20:16.860 --> 20:17.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:18.500 --> 20:19.980]  Uh, I'm OK.
[20:20.160 --> 20:20.880]  Thanks for asking.
[20:21.300 --> 20:22.820]  Um, you know, I had the colonoscopy.
[20:23.060 --> 20:23.700]  It was a nightmare.
[20:24.400 --> 20:27.640]  I do have a story to share with you at some point.
[20:28.260 --> 20:29.840]  And I'll I'll tease it.
[20:30.200 --> 20:32.720]  There's a pastrami plot twist in my life.
[20:33.080 --> 20:34.920]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[20:35.180 --> 20:37.220]  Did they find some pastrami up your ass?
[20:38.320 --> 20:40.940]  Well, uh, but but we don't have to get into that right now
[20:40.940 --> 20:42.540]  if you guys want to talk about movies or whatever.
[20:43.040 --> 20:45.240]  What's your favorite Mission Impossible movie, Andrew?
[20:45.600 --> 20:47.060]  What was your second favorite Mission Impossible?
[20:47.060 --> 20:49.040]  What's your second favorite?
[20:49.820 --> 20:51.660]  This is going to be like a really weird qualifier.
[20:51.980 --> 20:54.420]  I think the second best Mission Impossible movie
[20:54.420 --> 20:57.500]  is the first act of Mission Impossible one.
[20:57.980 --> 21:00.260]  Up until he sprints out of the restaurant.
[21:00.600 --> 21:04.140]  I think that is like the greatest sequence of of any Mission Impossible.
[21:04.660 --> 21:08.200]  But that's before he's hanging from the wire in the room with the pressure for.
[21:08.840 --> 21:10.180]  Yeah, I don't really care about like that.
[21:10.220 --> 21:10.920]  That seems fine.
[21:11.140 --> 21:14.620]  But like, I think iconic, it is an iconic scene.
[21:14.620 --> 21:18.560]  But the movie really loses me from the point he sprints out of the restaurant.
[21:18.860 --> 21:22.440]  I think everything to that point is like pretty intense and enjoyable.
[21:22.840 --> 21:25.400]  And there is after he's blown up the fish tank with the gun.
[21:25.460 --> 21:28.360]  Yeah, literally, as soon as as soon as he sprints out
[21:28.360 --> 21:32.400]  after blowing up the fish tank with the gum, that movie takes a nosedive for me.
[21:34.420 --> 21:37.300]  It drops down dramatically after that, I would say.
[21:38.760 --> 21:41.560]  What is the the second, the last one that came out?
[21:42.520 --> 21:43.360]  Which one was that?
[21:43.620 --> 21:43.960]  Rogue Nation.
[21:44.300 --> 21:45.540]  Rogue Nation was pretty good.
[21:45.720 --> 21:46.540]  No, I enjoyed that one.
[21:46.900 --> 21:48.220]  No, wait. Yeah.
[21:48.880 --> 21:49.460]  Don't know.
[21:50.300 --> 21:51.280]  What has posted?
[21:51.820 --> 21:52.920]  The Apple Dumpling Gang.
[21:53.160 --> 21:57.260]  A Disney movie called the Apple Dumpling Gang.
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.960]  I was just on the nether for later.
[21:59.160 --> 22:01.760]  I was just thinking about my favorite movies as a kid the other day.
[22:01.980 --> 22:05.960]  And I was thinking about how many Don Knotts movies I used to watch when I was a kid.
[22:06.280 --> 22:09.680]  And the Apple Dumpling Gang and the Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again
[22:09.680 --> 22:11.340]  were two of my favorite movies as a kid.
[22:11.340 --> 22:16.060]  And I and I looked up the the poster and I was like, oh, shit, that's kind of funny
[22:16.060 --> 22:18.180]  because we're at we were an Apple podcast now.
[22:18.480 --> 22:22.400]  Yeah, I was wondering if we should make an Apple scrumpling gang poster,
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.140]  but probably not.
[22:23.180 --> 22:24.960]  We probably hit the Apple scrumpling gang.
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.560]  Is there scrumping in the app?
[22:27.600 --> 22:30.140]  Is the Apple Dumpling Gang pro scrump or is there?
[22:30.380 --> 22:33.560]  I think those dudes steal those kids, if I remember correctly.
[22:34.120 --> 22:35.540]  They steal the kids.
[22:37.020 --> 22:39.160]  Maybe I think the kids are orphans or something.
[22:39.160 --> 22:42.440]  And they're like low level criminals and they all end up in a gang, I remember.
[22:42.860 --> 22:43.460]  I don't know why.
[22:43.740 --> 22:47.580]  I assume the children were the Apple Dumpling Gang and not the two guys
[22:47.580 --> 22:48.160]  in the background.
[22:48.560 --> 22:51.760]  I think I have completely misread who the gang was
[22:53.120 --> 22:54.760]  because two people in a gang.
[22:55.320 --> 22:58.100]  No, you need at least six for a gang, I would say.
[22:58.100 --> 22:59.160]  I think you need at least three.
[22:59.820 --> 23:02.320]  You three. No, three's too little.
[23:02.420 --> 23:04.960]  The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again ain't no kids in that photo.
[23:05.380 --> 23:08.640]  I think you can't all fit in a taxi.
[23:09.160 --> 23:12.320]  To be a gang, your gang can't fit in one cab.
[23:12.880 --> 23:15.840]  That's the I think that's the qualifier.
[23:16.260 --> 23:18.680]  We're going to have to order two cabs is the qualifier.
[23:18.760 --> 23:23.440]  I think once you have to have two cabs or maybe a larger vehicle,
[23:23.600 --> 23:26.820]  if you need a custom large vehicle, you've entered gang territory.
[23:26.940 --> 23:29.140]  If you need an Uber XL, you're here.
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.640]  OK, so I had to look it up.
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.020]  What qualifies a gang?
[23:36.560 --> 23:40.880]  Gangs are associations of three or more individuals who adopt a group identity.
[23:41.400 --> 23:42.280]  So it's got to be. Wow.
[23:42.700 --> 23:44.280]  So a threesome is a gang bang?
[23:45.100 --> 23:46.280]  I guess so. That's unfortunate.
[23:46.560 --> 23:49.920]  I don't. I mean, if those three people could identify as a gang
[23:49.920 --> 23:51.340]  and they're all banging, then yes.
[23:51.560 --> 23:53.940]  Well, yeah, I guess they need to identify as a gang.
[23:54.680 --> 23:57.600]  That means technically you could film a gang bang in one cab.
[23:58.400 --> 23:59.460]  You could. You're right.
[23:59.600 --> 24:01.660]  I disagree with all these qualifiers.
[24:02.060 --> 24:04.060]  I don't. Three is not enough to be a gang.
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.920]  It's a it's a regulation gang of three.
[24:07.280 --> 24:10.780]  So so we could we could be the Apple scrumpling gang.
[24:10.880 --> 24:12.160]  There's enough of us. There's five of us here.
[24:12.220 --> 24:12.840]  What are we doing now?
[24:12.920 --> 24:14.160]  Are we doing the boys of Dumpty?
[24:14.300 --> 24:18.880]  Like we got to get well, the boys of boys of Dumpty is a way better gang name.
[24:19.900 --> 24:21.960]  It's gangs left and right. It's gang city over here.
[24:26.960 --> 24:30.420]  We all know that going online without ExpressVPN
[24:30.420 --> 24:33.800]  is like using our smartphone without a protective case.
[24:33.960 --> 24:36.900]  Most of the time, you're probably going to be fine.
[24:36.900 --> 24:42.680]  But all it takes is one accident, drop their butterfingers on the solid concrete
[24:42.680 --> 24:45.380]  and suddenly you wish you'd protected yourself.
[24:45.740 --> 24:50.220]  That's why, in my own words, everyone needs a VPN,
[24:50.220 --> 24:54.720]  because when you encrypt to an unencrypted network in a cafe or a hotel
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.640]  or an airport, your online data is super not secure.
[24:58.880 --> 25:03.400]  And any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data.
[25:03.480 --> 25:05.660]  And we all saw those hacker movies in the 90s.
[25:05.680 --> 25:06.580]  We know how it works.
[25:06.580 --> 25:09.380]  Sandra Bullock's not going to be there to save us in the real world.
[25:09.760 --> 25:13.440]  And it doesn't take much technical knowledge to be one of those evil
[25:14.300 --> 25:17.420]  hackers. It only takes some malfeasance.
[25:17.940 --> 25:20.520]  And apparently any smart 12 year old could do it.
[25:20.720 --> 25:22.060]  Also, your data is valuable.
[25:22.360 --> 25:25.100]  Did you know that hackers make up to like $1,000 a person
[25:25.100 --> 25:28.720]  selling your lame, boring personal info on the dark web?
[25:29.100 --> 25:33.100]  That's why, in my own words, you should use ExpressVPN.
[25:33.380 --> 25:35.820]  The encrypted tunnel. It's super secure.
[25:35.820 --> 25:39.080]  It's easy to use and it works on all devices.
[25:39.500 --> 25:42.500]  That's like phones, laptops, tablets, etc., etc.
[25:42.640 --> 25:43.820]  You get the idea.
[25:44.300 --> 25:48.960]  It's secure, it's encrypted, and it will protect your data
[25:48.960 --> 25:50.860]  so that hackers can't steal it.
[25:51.180 --> 25:53.480]  That's why I think you should use ExpressVPN.
[25:54.040 --> 25:58.260]  So secure your online data today by visiting ExpressVPN.com

[26:10.160 --> 26:14.920]  If you want to give your family and friends a gift that keeps giving
[26:14.920 --> 26:20.160]  something more memorable than a gift card or a pair of socks.
[26:20.160 --> 26:23.120]  Although I'm not one of those people that hates socks as gifts.
[26:23.200 --> 26:25.060]  I think socks are perfectly acceptable as gifts.
[26:25.360 --> 26:27.640]  Big sock fan. But we're not talking about socks.
[26:27.720 --> 26:30.960]  We're talking about a gift that's way cooler than socks.
[26:30.960 --> 26:32.700]  A gift that's more useful than socks.
[26:32.700 --> 26:34.980]  A gift that's going to last longer than a pair of socks.
[26:35.060 --> 26:38.340]  We are talking about a sock for your butthole.
[26:38.660 --> 26:43.440]  Not exactly, but it is a Hello Tushy bidet and it ticks all the boxes.
[26:43.740 --> 26:48.300]  If you're not familiar, it washes your butt with a fresh water spray
[26:48.300 --> 26:51.820]  so that you end up way cleaner than toilet paper could ever hope to.
[26:52.200 --> 26:54.340]  You just spray and pat dry.
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.980]  You don't have to scrub your butt off like most people do.
[26:57.060 --> 26:59.280]  You're not going to end up with hemorrhoids like most people have.
[27:00.040 --> 27:01.260]  No comment on me.
[27:01.260 --> 27:05.740]  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you listening to this podcast have toilets.
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.280]  This thing attaches to them and without the need of an expensive electrician or plumber.
[27:10.600 --> 27:12.320]  Nobody wants to call those people.
[27:12.560 --> 27:14.360]  It installs in less than eight minutes.
[27:14.480 --> 27:15.960]  And that's a normal person installing it.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.680]  Like I said, not an electrician or a plumber.
[27:18.060 --> 27:23.360]  It cuts down on your toilet paper use by 80 percent, which saves money and paper waste and the Amazon.
[27:23.740 --> 27:30.480]  And we'll all continue to breathe thanks to you washing your butt instead of scrubbing your butt.

[28:04.460 --> 28:06.060]  Do you know what Eric's been doing?
[28:06.380 --> 28:09.460]  Yeah, he's been sucking on this 100 percent chocolate for fun.
[28:09.640 --> 28:11.000]  He's all fucking into it now.
[28:11.060 --> 28:12.580]  He sends update photos constantly.
[28:13.160 --> 28:19.220]  I found out a way to enjoy it where you don't have to just eat it in 10 minutes.
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.020]  You can sit down and have it with something and find pleasure in the pain.
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.040]  Why did you go for this?
[28:27.040 --> 28:29.000]  Just in your free time without telling me.
[28:29.040 --> 28:41.300]  I had I had the chocolate from face jam and everyone I got jealous because everyone did chocolate eating and it seemed like something I didn't want to do, but seemed like a fun thing.
[28:41.320 --> 28:43.280]  So I went, you know what, I'm going to try this.
[28:43.860 --> 28:49.420]  And I did. I had that chocolate sitting in there and just wrote in Google, what can I do with 100 percent chocolate?
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.660]  And that was one of the things was have it with a black cup of coffee that you enjoy.
[28:53.760 --> 28:56.380]  And I will say I've done it twice now with my mouth is watering.
[28:56.380 --> 28:57.940]  Thinking about it, I enjoyed it so much.
[28:58.640 --> 29:00.400]  Really? How many? Let me ask you a question.
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.300]  How many? So like you had a cup of coffee, black coffee that you enjoy very much.
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.140]  Yeah. And then how many squares of the chocolate did you have with that?
[29:09.520 --> 29:12.580]  Probably two and a half, three tops.
[29:13.080 --> 29:17.320]  OK, throughout the like slowly, slowly throughout the course of the coffee.
[29:17.520 --> 29:25.360]  OK, I found the best method was putting a little bit of dark chocolate on my tongue and then taking a drink of coffee and like letting it melt the chocolate.
[29:25.360 --> 29:27.700]  Because then I got a lot of the floral flavor.
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.420]  I'm a coffee guy. The way that Andrew is many different types of guy.
[29:31.580 --> 29:32.940]  I am a coffee guy.
[29:33.160 --> 29:36.120]  And I said you grind your coffee at home by hand.
[29:36.160 --> 29:38.160]  Yeah. Like I have like a hand grinder.
[29:38.280 --> 29:39.620]  I have like a I have like a hand grinder.
[29:39.940 --> 29:41.120]  I like that a lot.
[29:41.400 --> 29:46.580]  My I would love to be a coffee guy because the prep and the ritual of it seems like a lot of fun.
[29:46.600 --> 29:48.140]  And I feel like I would like to smell.
[29:48.380 --> 29:49.280]  Smells so good.
[29:49.640 --> 29:50.280]  It's very good.
[29:50.500 --> 29:51.240]  Smell would be great.
[29:51.460 --> 29:53.420]  Yeah, it seems like it would be meditative.
[29:53.420 --> 29:58.540]  I love that. If I could just do that and then not drink it, I would be a coffee guy.
[29:58.720 --> 30:00.100]  It might. My wife is the same way.
[30:00.340 --> 30:04.360]  If I smell coffee early in the morning, it changes the course of my day.
[30:04.620 --> 30:05.880]  It makes me want to shit like it.
[30:06.140 --> 30:07.900]  It just puts me in a good mood instantly.
[30:08.680 --> 30:09.460]  It does.
[30:10.360 --> 30:11.620]  Coffee makes you shit.
[30:11.700 --> 30:12.420]  No, no, I know.
[30:12.500 --> 30:15.600]  But but smell but smell specifically.
[30:16.400 --> 30:19.880]  Geoff's the one who got me into coffee and it's I was amazed at what it did to my body.
[30:19.880 --> 30:24.700]  But I've had so much coffee now that just a whiff of it gets me in the mood for a nice morning poo.
[30:25.020 --> 30:28.480]  It's like you've Pavlov dogged your ass with the scent.
[30:29.840 --> 30:31.000]  You could train.
[30:31.360 --> 30:33.540]  Have you Pavlov dogged your ass be the title of the episode?
[30:36.300 --> 30:37.260]  Yep. Absolutely.
[30:38.580 --> 30:42.580]  The the Kings Coast Coffee Achieve line that we had for a while was very good.
[30:42.960 --> 30:44.240]  That was an excellent cup of coffee.
[30:44.420 --> 30:48.540]  I prefer like a light roast, but I really found a lot of enjoyment in that.
[30:48.540 --> 30:49.880]  Very chocolatey cup.
[30:50.180 --> 30:52.680]  It was very straight in 100 percent chocolate.
[30:52.880 --> 30:53.340]  I'm yeah, yeah.
[30:53.340 --> 30:55.320]  My progress is I've done 70.
[30:55.440 --> 30:56.160]  I've done 78.
[30:56.160 --> 30:59.540]  I'm currently working my way through the 85 percent bar
[30:59.540 --> 31:04.200]  as I develop my palate over the the Q4 of this year.
[31:04.560 --> 31:08.260]  So, Eric, real fast, because I also love that Achieve blend.
[31:08.460 --> 31:13.520]  I actually just and not just because, you know, the the reference.
[31:13.740 --> 31:15.580]  No, it was a good cup of coffee.
[31:15.700 --> 31:18.300]  Yeah. So I subscribe to it on the website.
[31:18.300 --> 31:21.160]  So I get it like every three weeks or every two weeks.
[31:21.240 --> 31:22.340]  I get a new a new bag of it.
[31:23.220 --> 31:26.060]  So recently they just sent me a bag and on the label it said,
[31:26.340 --> 31:29.020]  hey, this used to be called Achieve, but we're going to rebrand it.
[31:29.100 --> 31:30.600]  Don't worry. We'll keep sending it to you.
[31:30.640 --> 31:31.860]  It's just going to be called something else.
[31:32.040 --> 31:33.880]  So it's still out there if you want it. Yeah.
[31:34.060 --> 31:34.700]  What do you know?
[31:34.820 --> 31:36.160]  Do you know which one it is?
[31:36.280 --> 31:38.180]  I that's the most recent one I've got.
[31:38.200 --> 31:41.580]  So as soon as I get the new badge, I'm going to batch in with a name.
[31:41.640 --> 31:42.360]  I'll tell you what it is.
[31:42.380 --> 31:43.600]  But you can still get that coffee.
[31:43.820 --> 31:45.860]  That's very funny. I think it's all I drink.
[31:46.020 --> 31:46.880]  Yeah, I love it.
[31:46.880 --> 31:49.560]  Huh. Good. Very nice. I like it.
[31:49.800 --> 31:51.440]  So, Gav, you were saying, what are you up to?
[31:51.860 --> 31:53.740]  85. And you enjoy 85.
[31:54.320 --> 31:57.760]  I 85 to me is still edible as just chocolate on its own.
[31:57.860 --> 31:59.440]  It's it's getting up there.
[31:59.640 --> 32:03.760]  I do want to say I don't want anyone to get confused about the situation
[32:03.760 --> 32:05.040]  that I'm in with the dark chocolate.
[32:05.520 --> 32:08.420]  I've enjoyed it with a cup of coffee because it changes the flavor.
[32:08.580 --> 32:10.220]  It's like smoking a cigar and having port wine.
[32:10.280 --> 32:11.760]  It's nice. It changes the flavor or whatever.
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.740]  I despise dark chocolate.
[32:14.740 --> 32:18.000]  I think it is the worst thing you can do with chocolate.
[32:18.240 --> 32:20.540]  I think it is an affront to sweets.
[32:21.040 --> 32:24.760]  I think it's pathetic that it's being pressed into actual candy
[32:24.760 --> 32:25.780]  and being sold in stores.
[32:26.340 --> 32:30.500]  I if it went away tomorrow, our lives would be better for it.
[32:30.780 --> 32:32.480]  That is how I feel about dark chocolate.
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.540]  Oh, that's that's you know what, Eric, can I can I say,
[32:36.720 --> 32:40.040]  I tend I try not to have definitive chocolate opinions
[32:40.040 --> 32:42.680]  because it's such a polarizing world we live in.
[32:42.760 --> 32:43.980]  But I'm going to back you up on this.
[32:43.980 --> 32:44.820]  I'm right there with you.
[32:44.980 --> 32:46.400]  I listen in. Do you say that?
[32:46.480 --> 32:47.160]  I couldn't.
[32:47.320 --> 32:49.180]  I it was like my heart was swelling up with pride
[32:49.180 --> 32:51.080]  because I feel the same way about you.
[32:51.300 --> 32:53.720]  And so I you have my back.
[32:53.760 --> 32:54.620]  I'm right there with you.
[32:54.680 --> 32:55.980]  I think it should be eradicated.
[32:56.020 --> 32:58.220]  You feel the same way about me?
[32:58.380 --> 32:59.440]  You think Eric sucks?
[32:59.600 --> 33:03.120]  And if he went away, I feel the same way about about dark chocolate as you do.
[33:03.140 --> 33:07.260]  Oh, you feel the same way as me, not the same way about me
[33:07.260 --> 33:10.840]  as if I were the dark chocolate and you want me to go away.
[33:11.400 --> 33:14.120]  No, no, you can stay because I like your opinions.
[33:14.120 --> 33:14.960]  I support them.
[33:15.100 --> 33:16.140]  Definitely what that sounded like.
[33:16.500 --> 33:19.320]  Yeah, it was one.
[33:19.520 --> 33:22.540]  You picked the one word that would change your statement into an insult
[33:23.120 --> 33:25.840]  instead of the compliment or support that you intended.
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.600]  I felt so good. And then I felt so bad.
[33:29.440 --> 33:32.020]  It's I mean, it's a it's a 15, 18 years of this.
[33:32.140 --> 33:34.580]  It's hard to it's hard to not insult.
[33:35.020 --> 33:39.600]  The interesting on the chocolates is as the cocoa content goes up,
[33:39.600 --> 33:43.160]  watching the serving size get bigger, I assume as really sugar
[33:43.160 --> 33:47.300]  starts leaving the ingredients, it's like one serving is two squares.
[33:47.300 --> 33:48.840]  And then it's like one serving is two and a half.
[33:48.960 --> 33:52.300]  Now, one serving is three until eventually the entire bar is one serving.
[33:52.680 --> 33:55.000]  Huh? Now, do you are you worried?
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.360]  How do you feel about milk chocolate?
[33:57.180 --> 34:00.540]  Because I would be kind of OK, but I think as you progress
[34:00.540 --> 34:03.600]  down this dark chocolate road, developing your palate,
[34:04.080 --> 34:07.280]  will your willingness to have milk chocolate lessen?
[34:07.280 --> 34:09.660]  Well, I'm hoping it's it's additive to my palate.
[34:09.800 --> 34:12.020]  I hope it's not ruining other areas of my palate.
[34:12.300 --> 34:12.740]  Can that happen?
[34:13.320 --> 34:16.620]  I would assume that it would replace that you would like no longer
[34:16.620 --> 34:18.840]  be able to enjoy what you previously did.
[34:18.900 --> 34:20.120]  Not that this is an expansion.
[34:20.700 --> 34:23.640]  When someone says that's an acquired taste, do you have to misplace
[34:23.640 --> 34:25.560]  a taste to make room for it?
[34:25.980 --> 34:26.600]  I don't think so.
[34:26.900 --> 34:28.480]  No, but I don't think those are the same thing.
[34:28.540 --> 34:32.900]  I feel as though you are training your palate to be able to prefer.
[34:33.280 --> 34:36.660]  Like ideally, by the end of this, your your chocolate of choice
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.160]  will be the 100 percent, correct?
[34:38.360 --> 34:39.720]  Like you will. We can hope so.
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.160]  Yeah. So at that point, I feel like you couldn't be further away from milk.
[34:44.260 --> 34:46.540]  It's the farthest you could be from milk chocolate.
[34:46.920 --> 34:50.440]  And I would be worried that you would no longer be able to go back to milk.
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.660]  And I feel like your ability to get 100 percent dark chocolate
[34:54.660 --> 34:56.580]  in the wild would be low.
[34:56.960 --> 34:57.840]  I feel like it's tougher.
[34:58.160 --> 34:59.900]  You're narrowing your ability to get chocolate.
[35:00.520 --> 35:02.920]  Here's where I think Lint are missing a trick, right?
[35:03.540 --> 35:06.400]  They they should have an excellent training bar
[35:06.400 --> 35:12.120]  where each square is new percentages until it is the entire package.
[35:13.080 --> 35:16.200]  What about like an advent calendar for your palate?
[35:17.320 --> 35:21.040]  Like every day, it starts at like 76 percent.
[35:21.180 --> 35:22.180]  And on Christmas Day,
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.140]  yeah, it doesn't need to even be a Christmas thing, just like a daily.
[35:27.360 --> 35:28.540]  Hey, this is where you should be.
[35:28.600 --> 35:30.840]  We're at seventy six point seven today.
[35:30.840 --> 35:34.720]  Maybe Face or Uniform could collaborate with Lint chocolate
[35:34.720 --> 35:36.400]  and we could get that going.
[35:37.100 --> 35:40.540]  Oh, by the way, how hot is that uniform logo we're working on?
[35:41.060 --> 35:42.960]  Looks nice. It does. I'm digging it.
[35:43.140 --> 35:44.080]  I'm really into it.
[35:44.140 --> 35:45.540]  It would look good on some chocolate.
[35:45.620 --> 35:46.800]  I'll tell you that right now.
[35:46.880 --> 35:48.380]  And we could you see it?
[35:48.380 --> 35:49.420]  You could see it. Could you see it?
[35:49.460 --> 35:51.820]  Can you see it like debossed into a chocolate bar?
[35:52.220 --> 35:53.920]  The uniform would look so sweet. Yeah.
[35:54.220 --> 35:57.720]  I can't wait for us to make a chocolate and then Gavin complain
[35:57.720 --> 35:59.140]  that it's milk when it's dark.
[35:59.140 --> 36:02.920]  Just be completely wrong about what the actual contents of the chocolate are.
[36:02.940 --> 36:05.460]  Are you referring to the sign?
[36:05.880 --> 36:07.060]  Yes, I am.
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.920]  I think a comment leaver left a comment saying that what is this
[36:10.920 --> 36:11.940]  bullshit plastic sign?
[36:12.040 --> 36:13.560]  I still don't actually have the damn thing.
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.340]  So I assumed that they were right about it being made of plastic.
[36:17.440 --> 36:19.500]  But Eric said it's metal.
[36:19.700 --> 36:22.280]  Yes, Eric, this is why you can't listen to comment leavers.
[36:22.700 --> 36:23.620]  I don't know why I was listening.
[36:24.220 --> 36:26.780]  I got one in my hand right now. It is definitely metal.
[36:27.000 --> 36:27.700]  Well, that's awesome.
[36:27.700 --> 36:29.040]  It's not as shit as I thought.
[36:29.400 --> 36:30.940]  Well, when did you get the sign?
[36:31.800 --> 36:33.500]  Uh, it mine came in the mail.
[36:33.640 --> 36:35.860]  Mine came in the mail the day we had that conversation.
[36:36.280 --> 36:39.060]  OK, I just didn't open it up till later in the day.
[36:39.100 --> 36:42.740]  I'm hoping I get I've bought every single piece of our merch
[36:42.740 --> 36:44.280]  and then they've sent it to me anyway.
[36:44.820 --> 36:46.720]  And so I've had double everything.
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.400]  Double waffle freshener.
[36:48.520 --> 36:49.660]  Why do you buy them?
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.860]  OK, well, it's part of the support of the show.
[36:52.100 --> 36:54.520]  At the very least, it's all limited runs.
[36:54.540 --> 36:56.820]  You're just taking one away from a comment leaver.
[36:56.820 --> 36:58.460]  You make the show.
[36:58.820 --> 37:01.280]  Why would you have to support the show you make?
[37:01.620 --> 37:03.560]  What do you support by making it?
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.480]  You also frequently go into the merch channel and get them to make stuff.
[37:07.600 --> 37:10.000]  You start some of this stuff and then you buy it.
[37:10.320 --> 37:10.980]  Well, I was OK.
[37:11.140 --> 37:14.660]  Well, I you know, what's funny is I think I was told I could be wrong.
[37:14.820 --> 37:16.860]  I was told I couldn't get a gerbil shirt at the time
[37:16.860 --> 37:18.500]  because of like the process it was made.
[37:18.920 --> 37:20.920]  And I was one of those.
[37:20.980 --> 37:21.540]  It was one of those shirts.
[37:21.860 --> 37:23.840]  But regardless of that, I don't mind.
[37:24.140 --> 37:25.540]  I buy the product for the show.
[37:25.580 --> 37:26.180]  I make the show.
[37:26.180 --> 37:27.460]  I'm happy with the show.
[37:27.860 --> 37:29.020]  Support it in that way.
[37:29.080 --> 37:31.360]  I feel like I'm kind of paying myself in a weird way.
[37:31.900 --> 37:34.640]  I don't mind ordering things, but the scrump sign's the first one
[37:34.640 --> 37:36.920]  I didn't order and I haven't got a scrump sign yet.
[37:36.980 --> 37:38.100]  So I think I may have just missed out.
[37:38.180 --> 37:40.300]  I think that's that was the cutoff, the one I didn't order.
[37:40.300 --> 37:40.780]  I'll tell you what.
[37:41.120 --> 37:42.560]  You can have my scrump sign, buddy.
[37:42.880 --> 37:43.440]  I'll give it to you.
[37:43.660 --> 37:44.700]  That's very kind of you, Geoff.
[37:44.920 --> 37:46.120]  You got to come down to Austin and get it.
[37:46.140 --> 37:48.420]  I'm not going to mail it to you, but it is it's got it's waiting for you.
[37:48.840 --> 37:51.180]  Is irregardless a different word to regardless?
[37:51.980 --> 37:52.600]  What do you mean?
[37:53.020 --> 37:54.220]  Well, you said irregardless.
[37:55.500 --> 37:58.360]  Um, what do you what do you what's your question here?
[37:58.440 --> 38:00.000]  Is irregardless not a word?
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.620]  Well, I would have said regardless.
[38:02.920 --> 38:03.980]  It's the same word.
[38:04.700 --> 38:06.680]  Irregardless and regardless are used interchangeably.
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.500]  So you respect your reply to an email.
[38:09.680 --> 38:10.860]  You could say irregarding.
[38:11.400 --> 38:14.200]  No, I think you have to say I think irregardless is the word.
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.620]  I feel like I didn't invent the word.
[38:16.740 --> 38:17.340]  I feel like that.
[38:17.580 --> 38:19.520]  No, you didn't. It's in the fucking dictionary, dude.
[38:19.900 --> 38:20.740]  It's a real thing.
[38:20.860 --> 38:21.580]  It's not a word.
[38:21.900 --> 38:22.900]  Or it's the same word.
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.540]  Irregardless, dictionary.com, irregardless, adverb, nonstandard, regardless.
[38:28.980 --> 38:32.060]  The photographer always says irregardless of how his subjects are feeling.
[38:32.260 --> 38:32.540]  Smile.
[38:33.200 --> 38:34.380]  Frequently asked questions.
[38:34.540 --> 38:35.580]  Is irregardless a word?
[38:35.740 --> 38:39.060]  Yes, it may not be a word you like or a word you can use in a term paper,
[38:39.060 --> 38:41.660]  but irregardless certainly is a word.
[38:42.060 --> 38:42.680]  So there we go.
[38:42.800 --> 38:43.880]  The same thing is regardless.
[38:44.420 --> 38:45.080]  Yes, it does.
[38:45.460 --> 38:48.560]  Look at you fucking guys coming at me for my irregardless use.
[38:48.660 --> 38:50.020]  Don't you don't you guys?
[38:50.100 --> 38:50.960]  I'm right there with you, buddy.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.200]  I'm on the side of irregardless.
[38:52.200 --> 38:53.360]  Well, I wasn't slamming you on it.
[38:53.420 --> 38:55.840]  I was asking, is that the same as regardless?
[38:56.120 --> 38:57.520]  You know what? I wasn't going to do this.
[38:57.680 --> 39:00.500]  I'm going to come at the fucking European language and how they spelled it.
[39:00.540 --> 39:02.780]  You know how they spelled jail in Europe, Geoff?
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.340]  You know, they spell it fucking AOL or whatever.
[39:06.580 --> 39:09.320]  G-A-I-L. Horrendous.
[39:09.720 --> 39:12.060]  Terrible. G-A-O-L.
[39:12.620 --> 39:13.420]  That's in Australia.
[39:13.940 --> 39:15.920]  Oh, the Melbourne Gael.
[39:16.440 --> 39:19.660]  I'm playing through the Sherlock Holmes game right now.
[39:20.040 --> 39:21.920]  And whenever they say it, that's how it's spelled.
[39:22.200 --> 39:23.300]  And it's disgusting.
[39:23.560 --> 39:24.200]  It makes me sick.
[39:25.860 --> 39:27.980]  Well, it's spelled jail now.
[39:28.300 --> 39:29.000]  Hot take.
[39:29.400 --> 39:32.320]  Well, no, I don't know if it is because they it's spelled the way.
[39:32.500 --> 39:32.720]  I don't know.
[39:32.760 --> 39:35.960]  Maybe they're doing it like within the timeline of that game
[39:35.960 --> 39:37.300]  because it's set in the past.
[39:37.420 --> 39:41.820]  But every time I see it, we have given shit to judgment
[39:41.820 --> 39:44.520]  spelling the U.S. spelling a judgment, also terrible.
[39:44.820 --> 39:46.400]  But they Europe fucked up jail.
[39:46.820 --> 39:49.380]  That's a horrendous way to spell judgment.
[39:51.840 --> 39:52.640]  Judgment. Awful.
[39:54.340 --> 39:55.040]  Terrible sounding.
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.640]  So if you're going to come at me for irregardless, I'll bring up jail.
[39:58.680 --> 40:00.880]  OK, we're not. I was asking you.
[40:01.240 --> 40:03.900]  You said you were coming at him pretty hard.
[40:04.220 --> 40:06.980]  Well, I think Nick and Eric were coming harder.
[40:07.600 --> 40:08.920]  I mean, I couldn't tell.
[40:09.280 --> 40:12.020]  You know, I did. I did take their theirs as an affront as well.
[40:12.060 --> 40:12.700]  But it's text.
[40:12.800 --> 40:13.920]  They were replying in text.
[40:13.980 --> 40:15.440]  You can't read tone and text.
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.800]  Should we talk about what Geoff text us the other day?
[40:19.380 --> 40:21.140]  What did Geoff text us the other day?
[40:21.720 --> 40:23.720]  Well, it started with a picture of an Apple van.
[40:25.520 --> 40:27.000]  Did I just miss that?
[40:27.080 --> 40:27.960]  I miss his texts.
[40:29.160 --> 40:30.620]  I think you probably did, buddy.
[40:31.020 --> 40:31.920]  What were they were texts?
[40:32.180 --> 40:32.900]  They were texts.
[40:33.020 --> 40:34.320]  So your phone was probably off.
[40:34.460 --> 40:38.160]  If we weren't, if it wasn't during the recording, you probably didn't get it.
[40:38.340 --> 40:40.000]  Shall I read out what you text us?
[40:40.620 --> 40:44.400]  Yeah, you can read it out and then we can get into that story if you want.
[40:44.700 --> 40:45.280]  Yeah, I'd love to.
[40:45.280 --> 40:54.620]  So Friday, 1241 p.m., Geoff just sent a picture of a van with apples on the back and he wrote,
[40:55.300 --> 40:57.580]  Oh, yeah, so it's a wapples.
[40:59.800 --> 41:07.160]  Eric then said colonoscopy went well, then Geoff said there and a van of apples.
[41:07.920 --> 41:09.160]  It's a hot day.
[41:09.520 --> 41:14.140]  I saw so many people at a redressing restraint eat place.
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.920]  Eric said this rules, Geoff said, Emily said, Stop.
[41:20.080 --> 41:21.540]  I'm being really quiet.
[41:21.780 --> 41:23.080]  She's on the phone.
[41:24.720 --> 41:26.840]  Eric said, Who is she talking to?
[41:27.020 --> 41:28.660]  Do they know about the boys of Zimmer?
[41:29.360 --> 41:31.980]  Geoff said, It's pastrami people.
[41:39.080 --> 41:41.860]  OK, well, I'll say this.
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.000]  There's an accompanying video of that moment that I was not aware of.
[41:47.020 --> 41:48.620]  First off, I don't remember any of that.
[41:48.720 --> 41:50.320]  I don't remember texting that stuff.
[41:50.320 --> 41:51.640]  I saw the video.
[41:51.860 --> 41:53.400]  I don't remember being in the video.
[41:53.580 --> 41:55.120]  It's like a seven year old.
[41:56.840 --> 42:03.280]  This was all right, right after my colonoscopy and I was drugged the fuck up on
[42:03.280 --> 42:05.300]  propofol or propofil or whatever it's called.
[42:05.740 --> 42:10.080]  OK, so we'll get into the pastrami plot twist.
[42:10.780 --> 42:12.740]  So I was with you guys last week.
[42:12.780 --> 42:14.140]  You know, I was 36 percent.
[42:14.220 --> 42:15.680]  Then I was up to like 42 or whatever.
[42:16.400 --> 42:17.920]  It was I'll say this.
[42:17.940 --> 42:19.160]  This is my second colonoscopy.
[42:19.520 --> 42:21.460]  First one, I was about Gavin's age when I did it.
[42:21.540 --> 42:24.700]  It was sucked, but it wasn't the end of the world.
[42:24.880 --> 42:27.380]  I bounced back, you know, it wasn't a big deal.
[42:27.960 --> 42:30.880]  This one fucking just wrecked me.
[42:31.200 --> 42:37.200]  Doing the special diet and then like not eating for three days and then doing all
[42:37.200 --> 42:39.040]  the solutions and stuff, it was rough.
[42:39.180 --> 42:40.500]  I had a really hard time with it.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.940]  And I guess it's just age shit, right?
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.900]  Because I'd done it before when I was younger and it was fine.
[42:44.900 --> 42:46.320]  So then we go in.
[42:46.980 --> 42:49.540]  The plan is you go in, you do the colonoscopy.
[42:50.480 --> 42:51.600]  They knock you out.
[42:51.740 --> 42:53.000]  They shove cameras up your asshole.
[42:53.160 --> 42:53.760]  They take pictures.
[42:54.340 --> 42:55.060]  You come back.
[42:55.140 --> 42:55.920]  They wake you up.
[42:56.260 --> 42:59.040]  Then the cool thing is they're like, you can have whatever you want to drink.
[42:59.120 --> 42:59.800]  We've got it all.
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.000]  And and then you can eat whatever you want, because it's not one of those things where
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.660]  you like have to come out of it slowly or whatever.
[43:05.700 --> 43:06.660]  They're like, no, gorgeous.
[43:07.100 --> 43:08.900]  Engorge yourself on whatever you want.
[43:09.200 --> 43:11.200]  So I had a whole game plan when we got in there.
[43:11.300 --> 43:12.720]  We had we had it set up.
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.500]  Emily was going to order the sandwich, the p-word sandwich, and I was going to eat it.
[43:16.520 --> 43:19.580]  It was going to be my first meal back after a successful colonoscopy.
[43:20.280 --> 43:21.140]  Then we get in there.
[43:21.220 --> 43:21.880]  I'm in the waiting room.
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.520]  You know, they're taking blood, doing all the stuff.
[43:23.600 --> 43:25.620]  I'm in the gown sitting there joking around.
[43:26.040 --> 43:27.880]  And the lady says, what do you want to drink when you come out?
[43:27.920 --> 43:29.140]  And I go, what are my options?
[43:29.220 --> 43:29.980]  And she goes, we got it all.
[43:30.020 --> 43:30.840]  We got fruit juice.
[43:30.920 --> 43:31.540]  We got water.
[43:31.680 --> 43:32.440]  We got sodas.
[43:32.540 --> 43:33.780]  And I go, do you have diet soda?
[43:33.860 --> 43:34.940]  And she goes, we have Diet Coke.
[43:35.260 --> 43:38.280]  And I was like, can I have a Diet Coke right after the colonoscopy?
[43:38.380 --> 43:40.260]  And she was like, you certainly can.
[43:40.860 --> 43:43.780]  I let me recommend not having a Diet Coke right after colonoscopy.
[43:45.840 --> 43:48.680]  I didn't realize the problem with that until later.
[43:48.860 --> 43:51.520]  But so I go through, have a perfectly normal colonoscopy.
[43:51.640 --> 43:53.660]  I assume I don't remember any of it.
[43:53.700 --> 43:54.200]  I was asleep.
[43:54.360 --> 43:57.460]  I do remember drinking a bunch of Diet Coke immediately after.
[43:57.740 --> 44:00.600]  And then some hours later, I was home
[44:01.460 --> 44:03.360]  eating a eating a p-word sandwich.
[44:04.260 --> 44:08.380]  There is a video to accompany before we get that far down the road.
[44:08.380 --> 44:11.920]  And I guess it's when Emily is ordering the p-word sandwich.
[44:12.720 --> 44:16.160]  I can it's too big for discord.
[44:16.320 --> 44:19.860]  So let me put it in the face slack if you guys just want to watch it
[44:19.860 --> 44:22.980]  just to get a reference for how I was in the moment.
[44:24.100 --> 44:26.300]  Eric has a question for you.
[44:26.340 --> 44:28.520]  OK, Eric, what is your why do you keep saying p-word?
[44:28.880 --> 44:30.700]  We'll get we'll get there.
[44:30.860 --> 44:33.600]  Yeah, I just don't like it's just making me.
[44:33.920 --> 44:36.820]  Yeah, I also I'm filling in a blank and I don't like it.
[44:36.820 --> 44:39.620]  So if you guys want to if you guys want to stop down for about two minutes
[44:39.620 --> 44:42.400]  and watch this video and come back to it.
[44:42.400 --> 44:45.140]  OK, I'll watch this now. Let's watch it.
[44:48.840 --> 44:55.480]  This is. Oh, I feel like we missed out on an opportunity.
[44:55.720 --> 44:56.560]  We should have interacted.
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.380]  I wish there were more.
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.440]  So I have. Yeah, I have no memory of any of that.
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.560]  But apparently I saw that van and I texted you guys about it.
[45:10.640 --> 45:13.240]  And apparently I texted you like I was a 90 year old man
[45:14.420 --> 45:16.280]  using one finger anyway.
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.640]  So I have no memory of any of that.
[45:17.700 --> 45:22.760]  But we get home and we go from there to the to the deli to get that sandwich.
[45:22.920 --> 45:26.620]  And then we go home and Emily's like, OK, you got some more soda.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.560]  You got your your your pea sandwich and you go to town.
[45:30.580 --> 45:31.600]  I got to leave for a little bit.
[45:31.600 --> 45:32.580]  She had to do some other stuff.
[45:33.060 --> 45:37.880]  So I started to eat the sandwich and and then I got full real fast
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.020]  because, you know, I hadn't eaten in days.
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.080]  And so I lay down in bed as I'm starting to come to.
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.120]  And then I realized something terrible has happened in my stomach.
[45:47.640 --> 45:52.180]  And I run to the bathroom and I throw up that sandwich.
[45:52.440 --> 45:56.040]  Oh, no. And it's violent.
[45:56.800 --> 45:59.800]  And then I take a step back and I'm like, OK, I think I'm done.
[45:59.860 --> 46:01.580]  I think I'm done. Well, I did not expect that.
[46:01.580 --> 46:02.680]  I'm supposed to have a huge hunger.
[46:02.760 --> 46:05.540]  I'm supposed to like eat like crazy and replenish. I'm done now.
[46:05.960 --> 46:10.100]  I guess I'm feeling the ill effects of the the medicine, the propofol
[46:10.100 --> 46:10.960]  or whatever they gave me.
[46:11.260 --> 46:12.360]  I don't having trouble shaking it off.
[46:12.460 --> 46:15.120]  I think what really happened was all that soda on a five day
[46:15.120 --> 46:16.840]  empty stomach fucked me up.
[46:17.260 --> 46:18.480]  All the carbonation and stuff.
[46:18.600 --> 46:20.680]  And because when we talked to the doctor later, they were like,
[46:20.720 --> 46:23.500]  yeah, you probably should have just had water or orange juice or something.
[46:24.300 --> 46:27.700]  And so I wish they wouldn't let me have that Diet Coke anyway.
[46:27.980 --> 46:31.320]  So then I go back and I lay down again and I start and I'm not feeling
[46:31.320 --> 46:32.580]  any better and I'm starting to sweat.
[46:32.680 --> 46:33.720]  And then I'm like, oh, no.
[46:33.800 --> 46:36.780]  And I run and I have to throw up again and I'm on the ground.
[46:36.880 --> 46:38.360]  And this then it hits me hard.
[46:38.420 --> 46:40.300]  And I'm shooting pastrami, right?
[46:40.460 --> 46:43.900]  I'm shooting the P word in and and then
[46:46.180 --> 46:47.960]  completely nothing I could do about it.
[46:48.200 --> 46:51.220]  Not a goddamn thing in the world I could do about it.
[46:51.300 --> 46:56.260]  The the the vomit is so violent and it's so it's it's so virulent.
[46:56.400 --> 46:59.640]  It's coming out of me with such force that I shit my pants.
[46:59.640 --> 47:01.340]  I shit my pants bad.
[47:01.760 --> 47:03.760]  You know, I mean, it's all soup, right?
[47:03.820 --> 47:05.340]  Because I haven't eaten anything in days.
[47:05.460 --> 47:08.120]  And so it's just like yellow, green soup. Right.
[47:08.480 --> 47:12.180]  And so then I have to I have to sit there and finish throwing up.
[47:12.400 --> 47:15.880]  I have to finish vomiting with a with just like, I don't know,
[47:15.900 --> 47:19.720]  a couple of gallons of turd, like wet, lumpy turds in my pants.
[47:19.980 --> 47:23.640]  So then as soon as I'm done throwing up, I have to take all my clothes off. Right.
[47:24.240 --> 47:26.820]  And I put them over in a pile and then I go.
[47:26.940 --> 47:29.220]  Yeah. Then I go take a shower and I have to
[47:29.220 --> 47:30.880]  I have to I rinse my whole body.
[47:30.980 --> 47:32.220]  I have to get completely and totally clean.
[47:32.300 --> 47:36.380]  I take a complete shower, dry off and realize, oh, no, I got to throw up again.
[47:36.500 --> 47:39.220]  So I run back into the bathroom and I throw up one more time.
[47:39.860 --> 47:41.100]  But this time I'm naked.
[47:41.120 --> 47:42.880]  So I just shit all over the floor.
[47:43.380 --> 47:46.820]  This is the second time I shit a bathroom floor this year.
[47:46.900 --> 47:47.920]  I'm breaking records.
[47:48.580 --> 47:53.940]  And I mean, it's like a shotgun blast of yellow liquid everywhere.
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.820]  So I throw up for a while longer and then I have to clean my entire bathroom floor.
[47:58.820 --> 48:00.040]  Then I have to do all the laundry.
[48:00.160 --> 48:03.400]  Then I have to take another shower and then I have to lay down.
[48:04.060 --> 48:05.760]  Here's the pastrami plot twist.
[48:06.200 --> 48:09.340]  Oh, Jesus. That's the last time I will ever say that word.
[48:09.840 --> 48:11.660]  To say it makes me nauseous.
[48:11.980 --> 48:14.520]  To smell it in my head makes me nauseous.
[48:14.540 --> 48:16.700]  To think about it, to think about the smell.
[48:16.920 --> 48:18.720]  I can't ever touch it again.
[48:19.040 --> 48:20.800]  No, it's gone.
[48:20.940 --> 48:22.100]  It's ruined for me.
[48:22.380 --> 48:24.740]  The colonoscopy killed that sandwich.
[48:24.800 --> 48:27.000]  It killed that flavor. It killed that word.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.860]  I'm telling you, I'm sweating thinking about it.
[48:30.740 --> 48:33.600]  It's... I can't, I can't, I can't believe it.
[48:33.660 --> 48:34.480]  I didn't see this coming.
[48:34.800 --> 48:36.320]  I fell so hard for it.
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.120]  I loved it so much. Flew way too close to the sun.
[48:39.320 --> 48:43.120]  And then as as my little as as the wax melted my wings,
[48:43.280 --> 48:46.540]  I shit all over the land and then I plummeted down like Icarus.
[48:46.680 --> 48:51.080]  And I and I drown in a sea of of of shitty pastrami puke.
[48:51.420 --> 48:52.760]  And it's over.
[48:54.320 --> 48:55.440]  That's my plot twist.
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.860]  The colonoscopy killed the pastrami.
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.780]  And I can't say the word anymore.
[48:58.860 --> 49:00.380]  I'm not going to say anymore after this because it's...
[49:00.380 --> 49:02.080]  Not even specifically the colonoscopy.
[49:02.300 --> 49:05.120]  The person that gave you the Diet Coke murdered it.
[49:05.200 --> 49:05.840]  It was like a hit.
[49:06.020 --> 49:07.200]  It was like they put a hit. Maybe.
[49:07.860 --> 49:10.540]  That was too much flavor in my body all at once.
[49:10.800 --> 49:11.640]  And it was...
[49:12.200 --> 49:12.720]  I do.
[49:14.300 --> 49:17.240]  Is something wrong about having a medical procedure
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.560]  and the first thing you do after to start chugging Diet Cokes?
[49:20.680 --> 49:22.760]  Like that just seems inadvisable in my head.
[49:23.060 --> 49:24.400]  It just doesn't seem...
[49:24.400 --> 49:26.340]  Yeah, I feel like I'd have been on water and toast.
[49:27.120 --> 49:27.980]  Yes. Yeah.
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.400]  A soda is not what I'm reaching for after a medical procedure, for sure.
[49:32.820 --> 49:38.000]  Now again, when I like, I don't even want to really ask the question,
[49:38.080 --> 49:39.440]  but I feel like I have to.
[49:39.760 --> 49:45.580]  When we're talking about the splatter on the scale of the smoothie you made,
[49:45.620 --> 49:46.940]  how bad is it? Is it?
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.720]  Because that's on the second one, you're hitting the floor.
[49:49.720 --> 49:50.760]  OK, OK, OK, OK.
[49:50.920 --> 49:52.060]  What's the splatter damage?
[49:52.660 --> 49:55.680]  Much smaller room, self-contained.
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.200]  It all stayed on the floor.
[49:57.740 --> 49:59.040]  OK, but there was a lot.
[49:59.440 --> 50:03.340]  It was a it was a it was a covered floor, but nothing got on the walls.
[50:03.460 --> 50:06.120]  Maybe a little bit on the baseboards, but like not on the walls at all.
[50:06.200 --> 50:07.800]  Not above the baseboards. Jesus Christ.
[50:08.220 --> 50:10.800]  Yeah, it was. You shot the baseboards.
[50:11.140 --> 50:13.920]  It was maybe the lowest I felt.
[50:14.900 --> 50:16.060]  Yeah, I shot the baseboard.
[50:16.180 --> 50:18.360]  It was maybe the lowest I've felt in quite some time.
[50:18.360 --> 50:20.520]  And I was fucked up for a day and a half after.
[50:20.520 --> 50:23.520]  Like it took me most of the weekend to rebound.
[50:23.920 --> 50:27.240]  Yeah, it was just it was just I was in bed like I had.
[50:27.340 --> 50:30.440]  I felt like I had a hangover and I haven't had a drink in five years.
[50:30.640 --> 50:31.980]  It was horrible.
[50:32.600 --> 50:34.540]  I can't. I'm so sorry for your loss.
[50:34.760 --> 50:36.040]  This is what I am, too.
[50:36.900 --> 50:39.380]  What a day of the joys.
[50:39.840 --> 50:44.620]  The high of you seeing an Apple van to what happened a mere few hours later,
[50:44.720 --> 50:46.860]  I assume. Yeah.
[50:48.300 --> 50:51.420]  It's what it's it's a it's a real tragedy, man.
[50:51.500 --> 50:54.340]  I I can't believe I don't want it to be true.
[50:54.480 --> 50:57.500]  I keep thinking like I wake up the next day and I'm like, maybe today it won't.
[50:57.580 --> 50:59.360]  No, it's still the thought of it makes me.
[50:59.520 --> 51:01.040]  Yeah. If I see the word, I get nauseous.
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.240]  I've had some drinks that I've thrown up on that I still to this day can't drink.
[51:06.740 --> 51:08.320]  Yeah. Like like what?
[51:08.580 --> 51:10.740]  Well, there's this drink. There was this drink in England.
[51:10.840 --> 51:11.680]  I'm not sure if they have it here.
[51:11.740 --> 51:15.240]  It was called J2O, which was like it was like a juice in a bottle.
[51:15.240 --> 51:20.660]  And I think I just I had too much booze one night and then I was dehydrated.
[51:20.780 --> 51:21.780]  So I just chugged one of them.
[51:22.040 --> 51:24.640]  But it was too late and I just ended up throwing up.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.200]  But it all just all of the J2O flavor went in my mouth and nose along with the vom.
[51:29.220 --> 51:31.280]  And I still hate that flavor.
[51:31.460 --> 51:33.220]  One of my favorite drinks back in the day.
[51:33.920 --> 51:35.380]  That's tragic. It's awful.
[51:35.500 --> 51:36.500]  And that was just a byproduct.
[51:36.860 --> 51:38.580]  I had that with Mountain Dew in high school.
[51:38.740 --> 51:40.980]  I haven't been able to drink Mountain Dew since high school because I threw up.
[51:41.280 --> 51:41.780]  Got sick from it.
[51:41.780 --> 51:44.160]  That's not a good sign for your pastrami returning.
[51:44.160 --> 51:45.780]  I know, dude, I know.
[51:45.780 --> 51:47.520]  Still out. I know.
[51:47.920 --> 51:49.900]  Mountain Dew's been out for about 28 years.
[51:50.020 --> 51:53.660]  Yeah, this is like a weirdly regional Chinese food.
[51:53.760 --> 51:55.840]  But chicken balls were my go to growing up.
[51:55.960 --> 51:57.840]  Loved them. Great, great Chinese food.
[51:58.040 --> 52:03.060]  I puked once after eating them on dinner and there was a chunk of chicken
[52:03.060 --> 52:06.900]  on like the the the on top of the toilet on like the seat.
[52:07.120 --> 52:12.340]  It's like a chunk of lab killed, killed chicken balls for me for years.
[52:12.340 --> 52:16.160]  I still don't order them as regularly as I used to, but like never.
[52:16.700 --> 52:17.720]  And that one never fully.
[52:17.800 --> 52:19.040]  This is so full circle.
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.260]  This is palate regression.
[52:20.520 --> 52:22.040]  This is exactly what we're talking about.
[52:22.060 --> 52:24.660]  This is the palate regression for sure.
[52:25.360 --> 52:28.820]  I just I just I feel a bit like a hypocrite.
[52:28.860 --> 52:31.760]  Like I was just on the RT podcast like a week ago
[52:31.760 --> 52:34.140]  singing the praises of that deli meat.
[52:34.220 --> 52:37.800]  And now like now here I am like but a few days later
[52:37.800 --> 52:40.200]  and I can't I can't be in the same room as it.
[52:40.200 --> 52:41.180]  Let me submit.
[52:41.380 --> 52:45.020]  Is there a food, Geoff, that you hate that is very commonly loved
[52:45.020 --> 52:46.300]  that people are like, you really?
[52:47.320 --> 52:48.040]  Yeah, dude.
[52:48.700 --> 52:49.580]  Did we just lose him?
[52:49.680 --> 52:50.200]  I lost him.
[52:50.560 --> 52:51.480]  Yeah, I think we lost him.
[52:51.660 --> 52:52.480]  Let's wait for the weekly.
[52:52.840 --> 52:53.200]  Yeah.
[52:53.400 --> 52:53.900]  Weekly occurrence.
[52:54.240 --> 52:54.940]  Yeah, he's gone now.
[52:55.720 --> 52:56.940]  Oh, sit tight.
[52:57.040 --> 52:57.700]  Oh, Andrew there.
[52:58.200 --> 52:59.280]  Must have run out of bits.
[52:59.580 --> 53:00.900]  Hello. Oh, there he goes.
[53:01.660 --> 53:02.600]  My computer froze.
[53:02.740 --> 53:03.360]  Sorry about that.
[53:03.460 --> 53:06.440]  All right. So my question was, is there a food that everybody loves that I hate?
[53:06.480 --> 53:07.700]  Everyone loves that you hate.
[53:07.840 --> 53:08.860]  Yes, that was my question.
[53:08.980 --> 53:09.940]  Yeah. Yeah.
[53:09.940 --> 53:11.260]  What? What is everything?
[53:11.380 --> 53:14.940]  White mayonnaise, cream cheese, cottage cheese.
[53:16.240 --> 53:18.940]  But like that, you would be sour cream.
[53:19.080 --> 53:22.400]  I don't feel like those are necessarily ranch dressing.
[53:22.960 --> 53:24.200]  Social foods.
[53:24.200 --> 53:27.620]  I'm trying to think of like pressure because I'm saying that I'm assuming
[53:27.620 --> 53:30.880]  you're going to have to have a colonoscopy again in the future at some point.
[53:31.220 --> 53:35.500]  And I think you should view this as an opportunity to take out another food.
[53:36.040 --> 53:36.600]  Guacamole.
[53:36.700 --> 53:37.720]  I can't eat guacamole.
[53:38.240 --> 53:43.520]  All you need to consume, drink a Diet Coke once again after your next one
[53:43.520 --> 53:45.300]  and then eat whatever that food is.
[53:45.640 --> 53:47.420]  And then if someone's like, oh, do you want this?
[53:47.460 --> 53:49.220]  You'd be like, no, I got sick when I had it.
[53:49.380 --> 53:49.940]  I can't.
[53:49.940 --> 53:52.480]  I honestly feel like Diet Coke got off easy through this.
[53:52.580 --> 53:54.200]  Like the fact that it didn't ruin that flavor.
[53:55.320 --> 53:56.340]  That's true. No, for sure.
[53:56.700 --> 53:57.380]  It's totally true.
[53:57.420 --> 53:58.740]  Well, I don't really remember drinking.
[53:58.860 --> 54:00.180]  I mean, I remember that I drank Diet Coke.
[54:00.260 --> 54:00.900]  I don't really remember that.
[54:00.960 --> 54:04.140]  I definitely remember eating that sandwich and I didn't taste the Diet Coke
[54:04.140 --> 54:04.800]  on the way out.
[54:05.360 --> 54:06.780]  I tasted the other thing a lot.
[54:06.780 --> 54:07.980]  It was in my nose.
[54:08.100 --> 54:08.820]  Oh, no.
[54:09.380 --> 54:10.120]  Yeah, it was.
[54:10.340 --> 54:10.580]  Yeah.
[54:11.140 --> 54:12.440]  Was it at least a good?
[54:12.720 --> 54:14.140]  Was it a good pastrami sandwich?
[54:14.680 --> 54:15.700]  Apologize for using the word.
[54:16.160 --> 54:18.000]  Was it good? Was it like a top tier one?
[54:18.080 --> 54:19.240]  Did you at least go out on top?
[54:19.380 --> 54:20.520]  Was it a delicious sandwich?
[54:22.220 --> 54:22.940]  That's disappointing.
[54:23.480 --> 54:25.700]  My stomach felt wrong from the get go.
[54:25.920 --> 54:27.340]  So it may have been.
[54:27.680 --> 54:31.000]  But when I dove in, I thought, oh, this isn't as enjoyable as I.
[54:31.100 --> 54:32.940]  And I thought, oh, maybe I have a little bit of a sick.
[54:33.120 --> 54:33.920]  I got to power through.
[54:33.980 --> 54:34.820]  And I never even finished.
[54:34.820 --> 54:37.080]  I had like a half through it before I had to take a break.
[54:37.220 --> 54:41.240]  And then I then then I didn't touch it again until it was to run
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.800]  into the kitchen to throw it away, just to get it out of the house.
[54:44.340 --> 54:47.900]  There's a beautiful edit of the last time we recorded of you in an episode
[54:48.280 --> 54:50.300]  discussing how excited you were for that sandwich,
[54:50.900 --> 54:53.620]  not knowing at that time that that would be the last time.
[54:54.480 --> 54:56.200]  The last time you could enjoy one.
[54:56.900 --> 54:58.240]  I had I had it all planned.
[54:58.520 --> 54:59.860]  We had it all planned out.
[54:59.920 --> 55:00.940]  I was so excited.
[55:01.240 --> 55:02.960]  It was going to be the highlight of the colonoscopy.
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.360]  A, the highlight of the colonoscopy would be that I'm there's nothing wrong
[55:06.360 --> 55:07.160]  with my butthole, right?
[55:07.320 --> 55:08.400]  And by the way, I'm fine.
[55:08.560 --> 55:09.240]  Colonoscopy is great.
[55:09.540 --> 55:12.280]  But then the second one was going to be was going to be like sitting atop
[55:12.660 --> 55:16.400]  a healthy butthole mountain, eating, chowing down on my favorite sandwich.
[55:16.620 --> 55:20.120]  And instead, I rolled down the mountain.
[55:20.240 --> 55:24.720]  And every time I I swung around, the sandwich hit me in the head
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.200]  until I landed in a puddle of my own puke and shit.
[55:28.420 --> 55:30.960]  And then I just lay there until somebody drug me out.
[55:32.720 --> 55:34.020]  It's it's terrible.
[55:34.660 --> 55:37.420]  It's terrible. I feel it's it's a real loss.
[55:37.920 --> 55:38.740]  The real loss.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.400]  Nobody feels it more than I do.
[55:40.440 --> 55:42.080]  I was eating this thing two or three times a week.
[55:43.460 --> 55:43.980]  It's true.
[55:44.060 --> 55:46.620]  We did a video recently where we were racing.
[55:47.100 --> 55:50.200]  We were trying to go far on a chair that was balanced on two hoverboards.
[55:50.420 --> 55:53.220]  And I halfway through the video, I'm just stuffing my face
[55:53.220 --> 55:55.440]  with a pastrami sandwich that you brought into the office.
[55:56.600 --> 55:58.180]  Yeah, I brought you guys extra sandwich.
[55:58.880 --> 55:59.840]  That was really nice.
[56:00.020 --> 56:02.700]  But yeah, Andrew annoyed me recently.
[56:02.840 --> 56:03.840]  What did I do?
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.480]  Oh, he told me that there's a store right by him
[56:08.480 --> 56:10.140]  that sells Princeton pickle.
[56:10.720 --> 56:12.380]  Yeah. And salad cream.
[56:12.780 --> 56:13.800]  Yeah. What?
[56:14.320 --> 56:17.940]  There's a I yeah, there's a store close to me that that sells both.
[56:18.040 --> 56:18.740]  I had no idea.
[56:18.900 --> 56:21.860]  I could literally see it from from where I live.
[56:21.900 --> 56:23.540]  And it was there the whole time.
[56:23.880 --> 56:26.780]  I sent you a frickin jar that I assume was mailed
[56:26.780 --> 56:31.080]  from England to America and then forwarded from by me to Canada.
[56:31.460 --> 56:32.300]  And you could have walked.
[56:32.960 --> 56:34.540]  I could like 100 percent.
[56:34.720 --> 56:37.200]  I ordered mine from from Europe, my salad
[56:37.200 --> 56:40.420]  for a product that I could see from my window.
[56:40.660 --> 56:41.740]  Yeah, I just didn't know.
[56:42.160 --> 56:43.500]  Didn't know that they had it.
[56:43.660 --> 56:44.360]  Wasn't aware.
[56:45.840 --> 56:48.760]  I was trying to think, I'm glad that that is the thing that annoyed you.
[56:48.820 --> 56:51.700]  I was trying to think, why do you think I would be annoyed at something else you did?
[56:52.100 --> 56:53.420]  Well, that's what I was wondering about.
[56:53.460 --> 56:54.920]  I was trying to think if I annoyed you.
[56:54.920 --> 56:59.840]  I thought you were going to call me out for my my agency blunder.
[57:00.300 --> 57:03.340]  My my miss call that we're talking about.
[57:03.460 --> 57:07.380]  James Bond. What what agency does James Bond work for, Geoff?
[57:08.900 --> 57:12.000]  Uh, you mean like government agency?
[57:12.140 --> 57:14.180]  Yeah. Like what? Where where would he work?
[57:14.440 --> 57:16.060]  I learned a lot about James Bond recently.
[57:16.700 --> 57:21.080]  He works for like an, uh, I don't know what not like.
[57:21.480 --> 57:23.640]  So I said M-16.
[57:24.480 --> 57:26.220]  I said he worked for M-16.
[57:26.860 --> 57:29.220]  That's not that. It's close.
[57:29.460 --> 57:31.960]  It was it's close, though.
[57:32.800 --> 57:35.500]  It's M-I-6. He works at M-I-6, apparently.
[57:35.900 --> 57:37.100]  If you read the I as a one.
[57:37.260 --> 57:40.460]  If you read the I as the one, I was I was directionally correct.
[57:40.600 --> 57:43.180]  Like you could mistake it for what I said.
[57:44.160 --> 57:46.520]  I also didn't know that Q's name isn't Q.
[57:46.580 --> 57:47.620]  I thought Q was Q.
[57:47.740 --> 57:48.940]  I thought that was just his name.
[57:49.020 --> 57:49.800]  And that was his cool nickname.
[57:49.820 --> 57:51.620]  Not that it was an abbreviation for his job.
[57:51.620 --> 57:54.240]  You said he thought his name was like Quentin or something.
[57:54.620 --> 57:55.840]  Well, yeah, could be.
[57:55.980 --> 57:58.440]  Like, I just thought it was a shortened version of what his name was.
[57:58.560 --> 58:00.940]  This old bloke called Quentin who works for a gun.
[58:03.740 --> 58:07.340]  Well, it was a conversation about what would his job title be?
[58:07.540 --> 58:09.520]  Because he's like an inventor of gadgets.
[58:09.800 --> 58:12.220]  But I don't think inventor would be what he'd be called.
[58:12.340 --> 58:13.360]  And then that's how it turned.
[58:13.420 --> 58:14.220]  He's a quartermaster.
[58:14.740 --> 58:15.600]  That's his job.
[58:15.600 --> 58:16.740]  He stands for quartermaster.
[58:17.180 --> 58:18.740]  Yeah. Hmm. That makes sense.
[58:18.740 --> 58:22.640]  I thought is M not is M not a version of her name, too?
[58:23.900 --> 58:24.960]  What's M's name?
[58:25.280 --> 58:26.100]  Probably from manager.
[58:26.200 --> 58:29.340]  It's hinted at that her name as Dench starts with an M.
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.000]  Yeah. And the new M is called Mallory.
[58:32.600 --> 58:34.840]  So it just it's clearly it's just a name thing.
[58:34.940 --> 58:37.620]  I thought they just were very like, weirdly, for some reason,
[58:37.740 --> 58:39.020]  everybody abbreviated their name.
[58:39.080 --> 58:39.860]  They shortened it down.
[58:40.300 --> 58:40.720]  Their nickname.
[58:41.320 --> 58:42.320]  Take a letter from your name.
[58:42.900 --> 58:43.480]  Q could be Quentin.
[58:44.240 --> 58:45.520]  M is Mallory, apparently.
[58:46.700 --> 58:48.920]  Didn't they review reveal that review?
[58:49.180 --> 58:51.460]  They didn't review M's name, but they did reveal it.
[58:51.560 --> 58:53.000]  I want to say in Skyfall, right?
[58:53.100 --> 58:56.520]  Doesn't he go into her desk and you see her name?
[58:56.740 --> 58:58.860]  Uh, in Casino Royale, he's like, I had no idea.
[58:58.960 --> 59:00.580]  M stood for and then she interrupts him.
[59:01.200 --> 59:05.440]  I could have swore that we saw the name, the full name in Skyfall at the very end of it.
[59:06.100 --> 59:06.800]  Really? It could be wrong.
[59:07.200 --> 59:09.040]  I based on everything.
[59:09.160 --> 59:12.040]  I'm wrong about literally everything else when it comes to James Bond.
[59:12.120 --> 59:13.320]  I don't know why I'd be right about this.
[59:13.380 --> 59:15.500]  So let's just assume I would assume.
[59:15.500 --> 59:20.200]  I would say I when in doubt, defer to Gavin on the on the James Bond shit.
[59:20.640 --> 59:21.420]  Yeah, that's fair.
[59:21.640 --> 59:23.200]  He knows way too much about it.
[59:23.560 --> 59:23.980]  That's fair.
[59:24.340 --> 59:26.040]  They're good movies. They're fun.
[59:26.440 --> 59:27.400]  Well, they're not all good movies.
[59:28.060 --> 59:30.680]  I think even the bad ones.
[59:30.860 --> 59:32.520]  Well, now, Quantum of Solace just sucks.
[59:32.640 --> 59:33.380]  I take that back.
[59:33.440 --> 59:36.500]  There's there's some genuine just bad Bond movies.
[59:37.260 --> 59:39.860]  What do you think the worst, worst James Bond movie is?
[59:40.320 --> 59:42.040]  That I've seen, I'd say Quantum of Solace.
[59:42.920 --> 59:45.120]  Uh, I think For Your Eyes Only is shit.
[59:45.620 --> 59:49.460]  Yeah. And I don't like On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
[59:49.560 --> 59:50.640]  That's a bit of a controversial one.
[59:50.660 --> 59:52.220]  A lot of people think that one was really good.
[59:52.560 --> 59:52.980]  It's a good one.
[59:52.980 --> 59:56.880]  What's the what's the one that the non-sanctioned one they did?
[59:57.420 --> 59:58.260]  Never Say Never Again.
[59:58.600 --> 59:59.860]  Never Say Never Again.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.740]  Yeah, I don't remember that one being great.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.280]  And the first Casino Royale.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.740]  Hmm. Is that the other non-Eon Bond movie?
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.600]  I think that was the David Niven one.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.060]  Yeah. David Niven was in the original Casino Royale.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.100]  Yeah. Hmm.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.340]  That's one where like James Bond is very clearly an alias
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.240]  and there's like a Jimmy Bond and like a bunch of different James Bonds, right?
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.400]  I've never seen that movie.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.300]  I haven't seen that one either.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.800]  I think there's like six James Bonds in it.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.440]  Technically, I read the book.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:24.960]  I don't remember.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.580]  I must have seen the movie as a kid, but I don't remember it.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.540]  Could I? I just want to give some credit to maybe the greatest
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.840]  not James Bond, James Bond movie for a minute, a movie that I feel is
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.000]  underappreciated in this time.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.580]  And actor Cody Banks.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.900]  That's a that's a good one, too.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.660]  I was thinking today.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.820]  It's so weird that you brought up agent Cody Banks.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:48.460]  I was thinking, have I just accidentally seen every Frankie Munez movie?
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.840]  I felt like it was possible that I had.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.700]  And it turns out he's in a lot of things that is just like obscure,
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.840]  kind of like post 2006.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.900]  Haven't seen a lot of Frankie Munez's work.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:05.560]  But Triple X, Triple X is a fantastic, not James Bond, James Bond movie
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.660]  from the millennium.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.280]  What do you mean from the millennium?
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.200]  Like the original Triple X with Vin Diesel.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.380]  What was the movie you watched on the?
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.460]  Yes. Yeah, it was. Yeah.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.720]  Yeah. Yes. Yes. Exactly.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.160]  That story. Yes.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.200]  I thought, sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. Great movie.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.960]  It's like if Vin Diesel wanted it.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.100]  Vin Diesel will never be cast to play Sherlock Holmes,
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.440]  but he clearly really wants to.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.620]  And it's the closest you'll get to Vin Diesel as a Sherlock Holmes movie.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.160]  There's such a great scene in that film where he's in a diner and he's like,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.680]  there's no way that this person is really a waitress because she's wearing high heels
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.040]  and that the shift that she works like that, that doesn't make sense.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.280]  Reading a newspaper on a Sunday.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.420]  That's a point like he is.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.700]  His delivery is so dumb guy trying to be smart guy.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.460]  It has a place in my heart.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.420]  I love that movie.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.960]  It's a terrible, good, bad movie.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:05.580]  Doesn't he like grind a rail or slide a rail on a serving platter?
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.580]  Yeah, OK, he does.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.820]  The literal beginning of that movie is they kill traditional James Bond
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.600]  and they're like, this is the Xander Cage is the new guy.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.820]  Sounds like the Tuxedo.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.820]  It is a better movie than the Tuxedo.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:20.760]  I'll say it right now.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.100]  That's a good movie. I remember it being a good movie.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.240]  He drives a car off of a bridge while Tony Hawk films him
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.280]  because the guy is like a senator who's against video games
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.020]  and he does a monologue about how video games are good.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:38.320]  And then he drives his car off a bridge and the senator's name is Dick.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.240]  And he's like, don't be a dick, Dick.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.320]  It's great writing.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.160]  Tony Hawk thinks it's very funny.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.420]  It's a great, terrible movie that I want to watch that one again.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.780]  You should you should watch one and three.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:50.740]  Both great.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.220]  You can skip to not really needed, but the first and third,
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.540]  both the Xander Cage entries of the Triple X series worth watching.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.460]  So wait, Triple X one is Vin Diesel, then two is like Ice Cube or somebody.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.420]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.120]  And then three is Vin Diesel again.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.740]  Three is Vin Diesel again, like 15 years after the first one that came out.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.480]  Is the second one considered canon in that universe?
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.480]  Yes, because Ice Cube shows up in the third movie
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.440]  and they do like a whole Triple X agent thing.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.800]  Why doesn't Vin Diesel like being in his own sequels?
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.180]  Uh, he wasn't in the second Fast and Furious either.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.600]  I just it was a money issue or an ego thing.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.260]  He's right.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.140]  Sequel is a shit.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.320]  I'll come back if the sequel worked out and then he's just in the rest of it.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.060]  He strangely was committed to the Chronicles of Riddick series, though.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.700]  He did. That's the sequel he was he was all about.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.480]  I think that's like, fuck, he had did he have something to do with
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.900]  with the story, though?
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.200]  I feel like he did.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.780]  Also, maybe is the second Riddick movie a prequel, technically?
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.200]  Also, he'll be in his own prequels.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.780]  Yeah. So like as long as the story goes backwards,
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.640]  you'll gladly be in the second one, but he cannot make a direct continuation
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.680]  unless there's a gap.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.660]  I still haven't seen the most recent Fast and the Furious.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.700]  I really need to.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.940]  I appreciate you don't have to.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.680]  You don't have to see it to see you've seen it.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:13.520]  I guarantee you're going to see everybody's already seen it.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.760]  I really it's good.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.800]  But you've seen it because those movies are so overly complicated
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:22.980]  because of how how loved Han was from the Tokyo Drift movie
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.340]  that like Tokyo Drift comes after five, six and seven.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.360]  I want to say just so that they could explain him being in it.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.600]  But he's back in nine.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.020]  So like there's no reason for them doing any of that.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.300]  He's just like they found a way.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.120]  And I really want to know how they bring him back.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.420]  I feel like he probably climbed down like a storm drain
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.900]  or like lifted a manhole and dropped it for a treat.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.700]  Oh, I can't. Yeah, you're going to.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.340]  You're going to love it.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.080]  I wouldn't get your hopes up about it.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.080]  Playing the game right now in the game is we should
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.900]  we should do a triple X tuxedo
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:03.400]  new Fast and the Furious like triple movie.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.900]  The head, what do you call it?
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.940]  Back to back to back when you watch an apple dumpling squad or whatever.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.360]  We need to find a like a through line between all these movies.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.160]  Triple feature.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.380]  A triple feature.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.240]  You mentioned Howard Stern earlier.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.480]  Do you think at this point, Baba Booey is more famous than Baba Louie?
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.520]  Yeah, I would think so.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.180]  What is Bob Drew? Do you know who do you know who Baba Louie is?
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.780]  No, I have no idea who Baba Louie is.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.700]  I know who Baba Louie is.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.720]  Your answer. Well, there you go.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.460]  Yeah. Where's your answer?
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:40.600]  Baba Louie was a Hannah was a Hannah Barbera cartoon character
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.120]  from back in the 60s.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.260]  And Gary Della Botte, who is the producer of The Howard Stern Show,
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.780]  got really into collecting animation cells back in like the early 80s.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.860]  And he bought a Baba Louie cell and he was bragging about it on The Stern Show.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.420]  And he called it Baba Booey.
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.320]  And then Howard goes, you paid five hundred dollars for this
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.720]  and you don't even know his name is Baba Louie.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.480]  You fucking idiot.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.860]  That's your nickname from now on, Baba Booey.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.960]  And Gary made the mistake of going, yeah, that'll stick.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.880]  But I think in Gary's defense, sometimes that character was called Baba Boy.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.060]  So it was Hannah Barbera as a group.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:18.680]  They weren't.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.200]  I remember learning those were two people and it blowing my mind.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.100]  No idea.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.060]  You thought it was one woman called Hannah Barbera?
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.400]  Yeah, I thought it was one person named Hannah Barbera.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.560]  Oh, could be first and last name.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:31.920]  That's true. Good work.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.180]  Sure. Should we end the show?
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.480]  We have so many movies to watch.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.320]  It's true.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.700]  Should we just do like a riff tracks of our viewing?
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.000]  I would I would love to.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.480]  Danny Trejo's the triple X.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.020]  Bring a Trejo back.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.700]  Can never talk about Trejo enough.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.940]  He's got a great role in that.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.300]  They make fun of how long his hair is.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.980]  He has one scene.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.720]  He's also short. Vin Diesel calls him short.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.800]  I don't know how much taller Vin Diesel is than Danny Trejo in real life.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.200]  What are Vin Diesel's stats?
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.980]  What is this? End.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.280]  Every podcast.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.880]  Have you noticed, Eric, that every podcast that goes off the rails
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.780]  ends up with Geoff googling Vin Diesel?
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.760]  Vin Diesel is six feet tall.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.460]  Is he?
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.800]  But how old was he in the movie?
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.920]  Nick just asked a very important question.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.440]  When will your Far Cry 6 Trejo playthrough begin?
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.380]  Nick, they removed Danny Trejo from Far Cry 6.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.260]  I can't do it.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.460]  He has been really.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.360]  Yeah, he I guess they accidentally released that mission before it was done.
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.160]  It's not supposed to come out.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.740]  Yeah, he's DLC for December.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.400]  And they accidentally put him in with a patch they were doing.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.040]  So then they pulled Trejo.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.900]  They pulled Trejo out recently with a patch note of like,
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.700]  we've removed Danny Trejo from our game.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.080]  We will be bringing him back.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.380]  You got to leave him in at that point.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.100]  Well, no, I literally I don't think the mission was finished.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.500]  I think they were still like.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900]  No, I finished the mission.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:56.740]  No, I did.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.180]  But when you do the mission, Geoff, he's like, now I need you to deliver my tacos
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.460]  and you get in his car and he's like, good job.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.820]  Like it just kind of ends.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.720]  I don't think they were done designing the mission.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.380]  Similar to P.T., do you think consoles or PCs
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.620]  with the unpatched Trejo will go for a lot on eBay?
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:18.540]  If they will, I can never connect this Xbox to the Internet again.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.720]  I bet mine's already patched out.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.420]  God damn it. It is.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.300]  Yeah, you can't. Yeah.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.020]  It's like he's he's gone.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.660]  He's gone, Geoff. I'm sorry, man.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.120]  No traveling Trejo.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.880]  But we can watch Danny Trejo in the classic film Triple X.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.440]  Maybe we should play less Halo and watch more movies together.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.880]  I would enjoy that.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.520]  Fine with that. Let's do it.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.540]  Andrew didn't even show up to Halo yesterday.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.520]  I had things I wanted to.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.180]  I missed it. All right.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.320]  A lot. Sad, sad, sad.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.420]  Well, there you go.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]  Let's not be here anymore.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.680]  Let's be somewhere else.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.660]  Maybe together or apart. I don't give a shit.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.680]  The audience, you can come along or not.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.580]  I don't even know.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:08:59.820]  Bye.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.220]  Hello, everyone.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.700]  Minor League fan Jack here to give you a preview of next week's episode
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.920]  of Face based solely off discord.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.660]  Andrew sinks his teeth into a cosmic crisp.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:15.820]  Or does he?
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.740]  Gavin is not a rubbish guy.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.980]  Geoff isn't edgewise at all.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.120]  Andrew continues to be bad at gambling.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.180]  We get an Apple score that will blow your mind.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.260]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.940]  All that and more on next week's face.
