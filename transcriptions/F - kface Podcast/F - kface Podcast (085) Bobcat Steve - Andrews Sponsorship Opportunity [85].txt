[00:32.940 --> 00:36.880]  I had a thing that happened last night, and it made me feel like one of the worst
[00:36.880 --> 00:41.360]  humans I've ever felt. Probably like a low for me as far as is. But it wasn't.
[00:41.500 --> 00:45.520]  You know, if that makes sense, I laughed at a thing. Hold on one second. Hold on one second.
[00:45.560 --> 00:50.740]  One second. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face podcast. I am Geoff Ramsey with me.
[00:50.740 --> 00:54.440]  Andrew, you said you feel like one of the worst humans.
[00:54.460 --> 00:58.240]  Well, I don't. I don't know if I want to talk about this because I feel bad because it's not
[00:58.240 --> 01:03.400]  the thing, but it was. So it's been snowing where I live, like way more than usual. We got so much
[01:03.400 --> 01:09.280]  snow and a lot of people have been trapped. And I was reading that apparent. I don't know if this
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.760]  is true or not. This is just like some random Reddit comment that the city I live in has the
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.140]  lowest snow removal budget in B.C. And so people were like, yeah, that's why that's why I like the
[01:19.140 --> 01:23.600]  snow is not being plowed anywhere. It's just there's nothing going on. So do you have a plow?
[01:23.920 --> 01:29.220]  I don't personally have a plow. I'd love to have you, but does your city? Yeah, my city has one.
[01:29.320 --> 01:33.520]  Yeah, they've got like six. I'd assume they've got a few, but they're not in use for whatever
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.460]  reason right now, or at least it doesn't seem that way. But last night, my entire building
[01:38.460 --> 01:43.180]  started to shake and I was like, what the fuck is that a plow? What is that? So I walked outside
[01:43.180 --> 01:47.560]  and I couldn't or I walked to my balcony. I couldn't see anything. I walked back in and I saw
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.700]  it again a few moments later. So I ran out and it's this fucking bobcat. There's this bobcat
[01:52.700 --> 01:58.280]  going down the street that was like plowing the road and like trying to remove snow or ice, I
[01:58.280 --> 02:02.980]  guess, from the road. And I looked at that and I was like, oh, I wonder I wonder what it's doing,
[02:03.060 --> 02:08.260]  like how impactful I've never seen a bobcat used as a snowplow. And I look behind it and there
[02:08.260 --> 02:12.860]  just happened to be someone in an electric wheelchair, like six feet behind it. And I
[02:12.860 --> 02:18.580]  started laughing immediately, not because of that, but because in my head it was like,
[02:18.700 --> 02:23.440]  that's the budget of our town. It's like they got a bobcat and Steve. They're out there trying
[02:23.440 --> 02:30.120]  to get rid of the snow. And I felt so bad because I saw it was if you looked at it from a perspective,
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.440]  it was me looking at somebody in an electric wheelchair and immediately laughing extremely
[02:34.440 --> 02:39.680]  hard. But it was all this context around it and had nothing to do with bobcat and Steve.
[02:39.680 --> 02:43.820]  But what was Steve doing? No, he was just he was just going down the road. It was just a
[02:43.820 --> 02:49.140]  complete coincidence. He just happened to be and he was far enough behind that I didn't notice
[02:49.140 --> 02:54.040]  immediately, but like he was part of the team. Is that the worst place to be on the road or the
[02:54.040 --> 03:00.080]  best place? Yeah, I was about to say, what if I mean, to me, it sounds like Steve is an incredibly
[03:00.080 --> 03:05.640]  rich, successful dude who has his own personal snowplower who snowplows in front of him
[03:05.640 --> 03:10.260]  everywhere he needs to go whenever he leaves the house. I was like the most baller fucking dude
[03:10.260 --> 03:15.020]  ever. Like that's like way better than a red carpet. I just felt horrible in the moment
[03:15.020 --> 03:18.800]  because it was like I looked at and it was not in any way removing the white carpet.
[03:22.460 --> 03:29.120]  So that was my my evening. Oh, that's Christmas. That is great. That reminds me real fast. That
[03:29.120 --> 03:32.660]  reminds me. You and I had a conversation yesterday, the day before, just brief,
[03:32.660 --> 03:36.480]  where I asked how the weather was in Canada, which is like the lamest question to ask,
[03:36.820 --> 03:40.600]  which is why I like it. It's like, how's the weather over there? It's like, that's not,
[03:40.780 --> 03:44.500]  you fucker. Is that what our friendship is? You know, we're down to asking about the weather.
[03:44.800 --> 03:50.720]  So I, I try to do it at every opportunity. And you sent me a picture of snow. And I couldn't,
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.380]  it broke my brain to think that you were snowed in at the exact same time. Gavin, I assume you
[03:56.380 --> 04:03.980]  can corroborate this and Eric and Nick. It was 87 fucking degrees yesterday. I, I cleaned out
[04:03.980 --> 04:09.440]  and reorganized the shed, you know, where I put my lawnmower and stuff. And I was sweating like a
[04:09.440 --> 04:16.120]  bitch. I had to take a shower after because I was pouring sweat. I, I cut a little bit of the
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.900]  grass yesterday because it's so fucking warm in late December in Texas that my grass is growing
[04:21.900 --> 04:27.960]  again. So I had to clean up a little patch and you were snowed the fuck in. Yeah, it was like 28
[04:27.960 --> 04:34.200]  degrees Celsius. Uh, and it was, it was like swim weather on Christmas day. Oh, that's terrible.
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.980]  Like it was snowing on Christmas. Beautiful. It was fantastic. It doesn't happen a lot here. Uh,
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.060]  it snowed last night. It like topped off everything that was gone. I'm like, I'm trapped
[04:45.060 --> 04:50.160]  in, I'm locked in. It's annoying. I wanted a McDonald's breakfast this morning, but I felt bad
[04:50.160 --> 04:54.820]  using a delivery service app on the same day where they canceled all mail deliveries because
[04:54.820 --> 04:58.500]  of the conditions. It's like, I can't, I can't order. It's early for you right now, right? It's
[04:58.500 --> 05:02.200]  like 10 in the morning. It's 10 in the morning. Yeah. Recording this earlier than usual. So you
[05:02.200 --> 05:08.040]  didn't, you, you like morally didn't go for it? No, I felt like it, if they have, if the mail
[05:08.040 --> 05:13.240]  isn't being delivered, I certainly can't summon a McDonald's order. I feel like that's just wrong.
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.420]  I feel bad. Even though they are volunteering to do that, but I don't know. It just felt,
[05:18.420 --> 05:21.800]  I'd have to tip so highly. What if you got Bobcat and Steve delivering your food?
[05:22.840 --> 05:29.040]  Yeah. Steve, I'm sure is great. Bobcat, I'm not sure about. Steve seems like a great guy.
[05:30.380 --> 05:34.720]  Speaking of like feeling like a terrible person during snow, did you ever...
[05:35.440 --> 05:36.960]  Such a specific category.
[05:39.600 --> 05:42.780]  Did you ever on like really snowy days, like if you were walking to school,
[05:43.240 --> 05:45.080]  play a game of guess who might be dead?
[05:45.580 --> 05:51.560]  No. What? If it was like fresh snow, you would just look at all the houses that had no footprints.
[05:52.480 --> 05:58.020]  No, it never even occurred to me to do that. Is that a game people play?
[05:58.920 --> 06:06.960]  It was a game I played with my friends. You just see like, you'd see either no foot
[06:06.960 --> 06:11.920]  footsteps or you just see the footsteps of the postman like going in one and then out the other.
[06:12.480 --> 06:16.240]  Like the occupants have never come out. So you're like, oh, they might be dead.
[06:16.700 --> 06:19.560]  Have you ever considered the moral weight of what if they were dead?
[06:19.760 --> 06:23.520]  What if you called? What if like do you think there's ever a prediction that came true?
[06:24.560 --> 06:29.060]  I feel like that's a really funny game unless you call out someone who's actually dead and
[06:29.060 --> 06:33.760]  then it's terrible. Yeah, unless you win. It's a really funny game until it works.
[06:33.860 --> 06:38.160]  If you win, it's sad. It sounds like the beginning of an unsolved mysteries episode.
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.300]  It's like when the mailman noticed his were the only tracks for eight straight days.
[06:43.540 --> 06:47.120]  The mail was piling up. I feel like that was a thing. Oh,
[06:47.320 --> 06:52.760]  God damn. So how was your Christmas, Andrew? Okay, this is my Christmas was I love Christmas.
[06:53.160 --> 06:56.760]  Um, I had three presents under the tree. Big Christmas guy. Big Christmas guy.
[06:57.080 --> 07:01.360]  All three of them got pissed off by my cat. That was my Christmas. Had a great time.
[07:02.960 --> 07:06.540]  Three, a hundred, nobody there. There are a few other presents under the tree.
[07:06.540 --> 07:10.940]  No other presents were impacted. My cat went three for three just over mine.
[07:11.180 --> 07:15.300]  Never happened. What have you done to Sam recently? I haven't done a single. I've been the fucking
[07:15.300 --> 07:20.680]  nicest to Sam. Sam's doing great. She's just living her life and she's pissing all over my
[07:20.680 --> 07:25.820]  presents. It was great. That was my Christmas. Before we like go deep, I just want to, I feel
[07:25.820 --> 07:28.720]  like we should shut this out because we didn't. I'm empty last week and my computer exploded
[07:28.720 --> 07:33.740]  trying to print the law. Um, there's another Christmas album and it's really good. People
[07:33.740 --> 07:39.600]  should listen to it. It's awesome. Ave Gavino is an absurdly amazing song. They did a great job.
[07:40.120 --> 07:45.640]  Oh, and I need to apologize to the, the comment leaver twins who asked me to participate. And
[07:45.640 --> 07:50.500]  I said yes. And then I, I got distracted and forgot. I feel terrible about that.
[07:50.580 --> 07:53.980]  A single. You can do a Christmas single in summer. I was all about it. And then, uh,
[07:53.980 --> 07:58.200]  I just, uh, I got distracted with other shit. Yeah. And it completely slipped my mind. That's
[07:58.200 --> 08:03.360]  fair. The problem is I, yeah, well anyway, uh, how was your Christmas, Gavin? Um, had a bit of a
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.560]  presence. Um, I, I'm, I'm, I hate to be like a last minute Christmas shopper because there's
[08:08.560 --> 08:15.380]  panic involved. You, you make worse decisions. Everything's more expensive. So in, I think it
[08:15.380 --> 08:23.000]  was September, I pre-ordered the, uh, Bo Burnham album inside on vinyl because he released the
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.020]  songs just on, on vinyl. We like to have a, we like to have our favorite stuff, you know, to
[08:27.020 --> 08:33.300]  play on a record player. So I pre-ordered it, or at least I thought I did. Bloody, uh, 20th
[08:33.300 --> 08:37.480]  of December is coming around and I'm, I'm like, wait, what, didn't I? And I'm searching through
[08:37.480 --> 08:43.460]  my emails and I'm panicking because I can't find any trace that I actually bought this thing. I do
[08:43.460 --> 08:47.540]  this a lot where I'll just like shove something in my cart and I'll just not follow through all
[08:47.540 --> 08:51.280]  the way. Like I'll get to literally the last button click. And then like three days later,
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.760]  I'm like, ah, I didn't press submit. Damn it. But yeah, I guess like three months went by,
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.600]  had absolutely no, no record of it. So I had to, it obviously completely sold out everywhere.
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.460]  I took to eBay. I was like, Oh God, because I hate, I just hate loss. I hate like paying more
[09:05.460 --> 09:09.900]  for something that clearly isn't worth that. And they're all like two, three times the price on
[09:09.900 --> 09:14.860]  eBay. You got paid for shipping and all that stuff. So I'm just like, Oh, I'm trying to find
[09:14.860 --> 09:19.980]  one that will be here before Christmas. I found one spent, you know, about three times the price
[09:19.980 --> 09:27.180]  on it. And, uh, thankfully Christmas Eve, it shows up. That's a relief dude. Did it show up in
[09:27.180 --> 09:33.580]  intact and what you ordered? Yeah. But then I realized same day I get an email, um, saying
[09:33.580 --> 09:43.020]  updated delivery date, 29th. So I was like, wait a second. Turns out the original one has gone
[09:43.020 --> 09:47.720]  through. I just couldn't find it because I guess I use Apple pay and, uh, I didn't actually have
[09:47.720 --> 09:54.400]  an account or anything. So my email just showed up nothing. So I got, so I have a second one coming.
[09:54.400 --> 10:01.000]  The first thing I open on Christmas day from Meg to me inside on vinyl.
[10:02.180 --> 10:06.620]  Oh no. We got it for each other. And I got two, we have three of the damn things now.
[10:06.940 --> 10:10.400]  So if you need, uh, if you need some nice Bo Burnham songs.
[10:12.220 --> 10:16.000]  You guys are the world's biggest Bo Burnham fans. Holy shit.
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.360]  I mean, we, I do really like Bo Burnham. I think he's a genius. I don't like him three
[10:20.360 --> 10:26.740]  vinyls worth, but, um, but Christ, I've got an excessive. Now I might take back to eBay.
[10:27.240 --> 10:32.340]  No, no, no, no. Hear me out. Listen, I got these things called BTS sauces. I got a lot of them.
[10:33.040 --> 10:39.460]  I give you 274 for one Bo Burnham. That feels like a fair trade. How many, what's the sauce
[10:39.460 --> 10:44.360]  to Burnham ratio? I think, I think you're, I think your sauces are, you're cutting yourself
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.340]  short on the sauces. I think they're worth more than a Burnham. No offense. Wow. Okay.
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.320]  Well, nevermind then, Gavin. You're not a Burnham fan, Geoff?
[10:51.800 --> 10:58.300]  I, I'm, I'm a Burnham ambivalent. I, I've, I've seen him in interviews before and he seems very,
[10:59.140 --> 11:04.320]  uh, adept and, and he seems lovely and really interesting. I liked that eighth grade movie,
[11:04.440 --> 11:07.840]  but I never saw inside. I've seen some of the standup, but yeah, I like him. I don't have an,
[11:08.320 --> 11:13.940]  um, I'm like vaguely pro Burnham, I guess. Inside and make happy. I think are very good,
[11:14.380 --> 11:17.700]  very good shows. That's what I hear. That's what I hear. Everybody,
[11:17.700 --> 11:22.680]  everybody seems to agree that they are lovely. If they're not three vinyls worth, is it two?
[11:23.100 --> 11:27.600]  Do you think inside's two vinyls worth? Would you be fine with two? Is, is the three like at
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.020]  what point or is it anything above one on the Burnham vinyl scale that you were saying?
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.500]  Is two acceptable? Like at what point was three like just too far is what I'm trying to figure
[11:38.500 --> 11:43.620]  out. Uh, well, how, how useful is two? I think it's nice to have a spare. Do you have two record
[11:43.620 --> 11:47.660]  players? I don't have two record players. Oh, you got a spare. You got to back up Burnham.
[11:48.160 --> 11:54.160]  Is it a, is it like a rare colored vinyl or limited edition in any way?
[11:54.420 --> 12:00.980]  No, there was one. I think there was a yellow one, but I didn't, that was immediately sold out.
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.560]  I wonder what you can do. There's gotta be something clever you can do with these two
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.700]  extra bog standard Burnhams. You got, you got two bog Burnhams you need to get rid of.
[12:12.700 --> 12:17.880]  There's gotta be a funny way to do it. He's accessible, right? He's an internet dude.
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.520]  Maybe we could figure something out with him. What's the, what's some random stranger
[12:22.520 --> 12:29.060]  accidentally bought three? Yeah. Yeah. Why not? You've got a following on social media. You,
[12:29.240 --> 12:32.800]  I'm sure you could make some stuff happen. Get him to autograph them and give them to
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.960]  charity or something. I think he did tweet me once. What's, or we could shoot him into space
[12:36.960 --> 12:44.000]  or something. I don't know. What's the most confused you've ever been by a gift? Christmas
[12:44.000 --> 12:53.540]  gift specifically. I can say I've once confused someone. Yeah. What was that? Did we disconnect?
[12:53.820 --> 12:58.060]  That was fucking crazy. What happened? I thought you were everything. No, that was straight. I
[12:58.060 --> 13:02.180]  thought Gavin was going to continue. I didn't know that that was, he took like a pause. Like we were
[13:02.660 --> 13:08.520]  that was fucking crazy. To see if, if that was like appropriate for the conversation,
[13:08.780 --> 13:13.600]  of course you'd give it like a go ahead or whatever. Fucking continue. We're hanging under
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.520]  every word and there aren't a lot of words to hang on right now. Fill us in. This is,
[13:18.620 --> 13:26.360]  I kind of feel bad about this now too. I, I once, I once got a Christmas card from my gran. Um,
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.480]  and I realized that I hadn't actually thrown out all of the Christmas cards from the previous year.
[13:31.480 --> 13:37.540]  And she'd got me the exact same card that she gave me the year before. Like I was identical,
[13:37.700 --> 13:42.940]  even wrote the same stuff. So I just brought out the old one and showed her. I was like,
[13:42.940 --> 13:48.120]  why'd you send me two? And she was like, Oh, and she was trying to figure out how she's mailed
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.200]  to you. I didn't tell her that one of them was from the year before because I wanted...
[13:53.700 --> 13:58.080]  That's so mean! I know! Now I wouldn't do it because I feel like she's so much older that
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.000]  I'd actually mess with her. But back then it was like, she was young enough for it to be funny.
[14:02.240 --> 14:02.620]  You monster.
[14:02.860 --> 14:05.920]  Uh, but yeah, I feel like, yeah, I definitely wouldn't do that now. But she was just like,
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.860]  how did I send two? And it was like the same color pen and like the same amount of stamps
[14:10.860 --> 14:17.880]  were on the thing. She was like, but I did, but how? Did you, uh, did you ever tell her that
[14:17.880 --> 14:21.620]  they were from two separate years or does she still think that she sent you two in the same
[14:21.620 --> 14:24.760]  time frame? I'm not sure I ever told her.
[14:26.700 --> 14:30.920]  But you know, she was in her sixties at the time. That's fine. That's not a sort of senile age.
[14:31.640 --> 14:33.700]  That's just funny. This is a funny joke.
[14:33.960 --> 14:37.360]  An unsolved mystery. It's haunted her this entire time.
[14:37.540 --> 14:40.600]  I feel like if I told her now it'd be more traumatic because she'd be trying to remember.
[14:45.060 --> 14:52.240]  You remind it just for her to remember to then ruin the thing. I remember, um, I got one year,
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.700]  so I don't know. I was probably like eight or nine. I was given Monty Python and the Holy
[14:56.700 --> 15:00.220]  Grail on DVD. I know what concept of, it was like my introduction to Monty Python.
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.300]  I didn't know anything about it and I fucking loved it. I thought it was so funny.
[15:04.780 --> 15:11.400]  And then the following year I was given breakfast at Tiffany's on DVD. And I was like,
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.660]  I was like, really breakfast. Okay. Well, you know, Santa really nailed the pick with the
[15:18.660 --> 15:22.900]  Python and the Holy Grail. So I guess, you know, he seems to know my preferences. He seems to know
[15:22.900 --> 15:27.480]  my taste. I'll watch. I watch. I thought it was so boring. And I was like, why did I get this?
[15:27.740 --> 15:33.540]  It was from Santa both years. I was still in like full on Santa. I was like, Santa fucking
[15:33.540 --> 15:38.940]  nailed Monty Python. I don't know what he was thinking with this breakfast at Tiffany's pick.
[15:39.540 --> 15:44.580]  What had happened is somehow my mom bought the wrong movie and then didn't notice in the
[15:44.580 --> 15:49.240]  process that it was the wrong movie. She was equally surprised when I opened breakfast at
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.420]  Tiffany's. It's just a complete accidental gift. Was she going for another Python and got the
[15:53.420 --> 15:58.280]  wrong one? I don't know. It was a year later. I don't know. I don't understand how she was able
[15:58.280 --> 16:03.820]  to fully wrap it without like having the thought of why is this a gift for me? Maybe she was going
[16:03.820 --> 16:12.020]  for Life of Brian. Maybe. It's got a name in the title. How old were you? I think I was like
[16:12.020 --> 16:18.900]  eight to nine or nine to ten. Yeah. Breakfast at Tiffany's is a was a great movie for but might
[16:18.900 --> 16:25.580]  be lost on an eight year old. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't also some pretty problematic shit in it,
[16:25.700 --> 16:31.360]  too, unfortunately. Breakfast at Tiffany's. Yeah, yeah. The whole Mickey Rooney plays an
[16:31.360 --> 16:37.520]  Asian man's stuff. Oh, it's pretty, pretty rough. Oh, that's not good. Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[16:37.520 --> 16:43.760]  What about you, Geoff? How was your Christmas? I think it was good. I'm trying to remember.
[16:45.420 --> 16:49.520]  I've been sleeping a lot lately, and so my brain's a little Swiss cheese right now.
[16:51.620 --> 16:55.840]  I had a similar kind of fuck up. I mean, it wasn't as hilarious as Gavin's or anything,
[16:56.060 --> 17:00.280]  but I did get frustrated with a certain company that you buy kitchen shit from
[17:00.840 --> 17:09.700]  where I bought a I'm not going to call them out. Silliam's Manoma, but I bought Emily one of her
[17:09.700 --> 17:16.300]  one of her like her second nicest gift was this giant, really nice picnic basket that has like
[17:16.300 --> 17:21.000]  everything you could need in it, like, you know, all the different silverwares and like even salt
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.180]  and pepper shakers. And it's all like really pretty and nice. I thought it'd be a fun gift
[17:24.180 --> 17:29.660]  that we could maybe start going on picnics and stuff. And I fucking I shopped around.
[17:29.660 --> 17:34.300]  This was in November. I bought this thing. I was trying to be ahead of it too. I shopped around a
[17:34.300 --> 17:39.640]  bunch of places. A lot of places didn't have any in stock. I finally found one at an unnamed kitchen
[17:39.640 --> 17:46.360]  supply store that I'm no longer a fan of. And they had one in stock. So I said, Okay, I spent a ton
[17:46.360 --> 17:51.120]  of money on it. I bought it. And it said like it checks like it item is in shop. So I bought it.
[17:51.260 --> 17:57.420]  And then I thought, Oh, I wonder when it's going to ship since it's in stock. And when I went back
[17:57.420 --> 18:03.640]  with the order number to look, it updated the shipping date from in stock to March of next year,
[18:03.760 --> 18:10.640]  maybe. And then it wouldn't let me cancel the order. And so it held it's held me hostage.
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.680]  So I had to buy Emily a Fisher Price picnic basket like for small children and wrap that
[18:17.680 --> 18:21.500]  and say like a placeholder. I'll replace this with a real one. Yeah, there's a placeholder.
[18:21.740 --> 18:25.980]  I'll replace this with a real one in four months, maybe. Well, it's fucking annoying.
[18:25.980 --> 18:30.260]  Next time you need a basket, Geoff, I got you. You just let me know. Give me a week's notice.
[18:30.400 --> 18:38.460]  I got you covered. I don't know why that company like Flilliam's Blanoma and Flilliam's Blanoma.
[18:38.660 --> 18:43.340]  Yeah, they they just sell stuff that doesn't exist. They sell just say I've stopped. Yeah,
[18:43.480 --> 18:46.780]  don't don't let me order something in November. Give it to me in May like that. You don't have.
[18:47.940 --> 18:54.460]  Yeah, I got something that's arriving five months from now. Goddamn, dude, I one time I this is
[18:54.460 --> 18:57.920]  I didn't buy this. This is not kitchen gear. But when I was living in the condo downtown,
[18:58.180 --> 19:02.660]  I was having to buy new furniture and stuff when I was like striking back out on my own again.
[19:03.940 --> 19:11.140]  And I had to buy some nightstands. And so I don't want to call out any particular company again.
[19:11.320 --> 19:14.220]  So I'm going to call this I'm going to call this company Mestmelm.
[19:16.280 --> 19:23.480]  Or let's call it Estwhelm. Let's call it Estwhelm. Yeah. And so I bought two nightstands from them.
[19:23.480 --> 19:28.820]  And I was excited about them because they had charging stations built in where you could just,
[19:28.920 --> 19:33.780]  you know, the like the the ones you just lay your iPhone on and it charges, which I have now. I
[19:33.780 --> 19:39.080]  bought a third party like I have like an external one. But these came just installed and there were
[19:39.080 --> 19:44.260]  USB ports built into the back of it as well. And I thought this is the fucking future, right? This
[19:44.260 --> 19:48.180]  is everybody's going to have this. So I was like, fuck, yeah, in stock. No problem. Bought them.
[19:48.560 --> 19:52.940]  After about a week, I got an update that they that the shipping was delayed, going to be delayed a
[19:52.940 --> 19:58.920]  month. Then right around the time it was supposed to show up, I got a delay another month and then
[19:58.920 --> 20:07.060]  it was delayed three months. After a year and a half, I canceled the order. At some point,
[20:07.420 --> 20:13.320]  at some point, I was like, Emily was like, you got to cancel this. And I was like, I kind of
[20:13.320 --> 20:18.520]  want to see. I just kind of want to see how how long it goes. And I had after about two months,
[20:18.540 --> 20:21.960]  I went and bought normal nightstands, which I still have. I was like, fuck it. I'm never going
[20:21.960 --> 20:26.280]  to see these. This is going to take forever. And then I thought, well, you know, and if they come
[20:26.280 --> 20:30.660]  in and they're really cool, maybe I can sell the other ones on, I don't know, to friends or
[20:30.660 --> 20:35.140]  whatever. And I still really want these new technological ones. And then after a year and
[20:35.140 --> 20:39.320]  a half, I finally just canceled it because I wanted my money back. But I'm reasonably certain
[20:39.320 --> 20:45.300]  that they never existed. They just they put a picture up on the Estwell website and said, here,
[20:45.380 --> 20:49.260]  buy this. And then they thought, like, maybe it's like a preorder situation, like maybe if enough
[20:49.260 --> 20:53.860]  people buy it, we'll actually go into production and make them. And they just never did. And so
[20:53.860 --> 20:58.800]  for literally 18 months, every month, I would get an update that my shipping has been delayed
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.800]  a month. I called them a bunch and they'd be like, oh, yeah, they always had an excuse, like
[21:02.800 --> 21:06.340]  it's going to, I promise you. I probably called him four times over the year and a half. And then
[21:06.340 --> 21:09.420]  eventually I just called him and I was like, just cancel this. And they were like, are you sure?
[21:09.480 --> 21:12.680]  And I'm like, yeah, I'm sure. And they tried to convince me. And I was like, look back through.
[21:12.820 --> 21:16.660]  It's been a year and a half. You're not giving them to me. And they're like, I see. I see. Yes,
[21:16.660 --> 21:20.060]  it appears that we're not. It appears that we are full of shit. We'll go ahead and cancel
[21:20.060 --> 21:23.480]  that for you right now. I've got one of those that I'm just letting go. It's just seeing how
[21:23.480 --> 21:28.800]  long it takes. I bought this, I think it was for, it might have been for Valentine's or her birthday,
[21:29.120 --> 21:35.340]  like 20, beginning of 2020, I think I bought this. And every, every quarter I get an update email
[21:35.980 --> 21:41.920]  on when this thing's getting delivered. It's like a left, it's like a dead by daylight statue.
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.060]  Mm hmm. So according to this screenshot, currently expected to
[21:47.500 --> 21:56.120]  arrive June 2022 to August 2022. When did you place the order for that? Feb 2020.
[21:58.920 --> 22:05.400]  And they've already charged me and no refunds. I can't even say, don't bother. It's just not
[22:05.400 --> 22:09.380]  an option. Yeah, that's that's what I'm going through with a certain picnic basket right now.
[22:09.900 --> 22:14.840]  Motherfucker, dude. I wonder who will get it first. I wonder if I'll get the picnic basket
[22:14.840 --> 22:20.860]  or you'll get your dead by daylight statue first. I predict face will have ended by the time I get
[22:20.860 --> 22:26.820]  the statue. It'll be over. Oh, that's, that's sad. I feel like that's too far. Like you are,
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.080]  that's enough time that you're no longer the same person when you ordered that. Like you've
[22:31.080 --> 22:36.520]  changed as a human being by the time you get that statue. It's going to be like a generational gift.
[22:37.200 --> 22:40.800]  Like I'll be a part of the next generation by the time I get it. It'll be like my,
[22:41.520 --> 22:48.700]  it'll be like my mum got it for me. There, there might be a second or third iteration of the game
[22:48.700 --> 22:56.220]  before it comes out. Like dead by daylight three or four might be out by the time you get this
[22:56.220 --> 23:06.340]  fucking thing. We have made it through the holiday rush, but now is not the time to start slacking on
[23:06.340 --> 23:11.560]  shipping your customers orders and exchanges. Shipping delays, supply shortages, holiday demand,
[23:11.900 --> 23:15.720]  last year was a mess. Now you're ringing in the new year with impatient customers,
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.200]  returns and expensive shipping rates. It's time to switch to a shipping solution that can handle it
[23:21.200 --> 23:26.480]  all painlessly. Why would you use anything but ship station? The easiest and most convenient
[23:26.480 --> 23:32.200]  choice for e-commerce sellers. Import orders from any sales channel, ship using any carrier
[23:32.200 --> 23:37.860]  with deeply discounted rates, automate just about any shipping task. Now, if I was going to move my
[23:37.860 --> 23:42.880]  sauce empire, there's no service I would use beyond ship station. With its ease of use and
[23:42.880 --> 23:47.460]  the money you save, it wouldn't make any sense for me to consider anything but ship station.
[23:47.920 --> 23:52.520]  Ship station saves you time by funneling all your orders into one simple interface no matter where
[23:52.520 --> 23:58.340]  you're selling. Manage every order, whether it's Amazon, eBay, Etsy, or your own website from
[23:58.340 --> 24:03.300]  anywhere, even on your phone. No more headaches from dealing with returns and return tracking,
[24:03.800 --> 24:08.520]  ship station makes it easy. It also allows you to save money when you compare carrier options
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.600]  and choose the best shipping solution every time. Ship station works with every carrier so you can
[24:13.600 --> 24:18.220]  always find the best fit for you. Your small business can access the same discounted rates
[24:18.220 --> 24:24.400]  usually reserved for fortune 500 companies without the contracts or commitments. It saves you sanity
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.720]  knowing your orders are handled and you're getting the best rates. Make shipping the easy
[24:28.720 --> 24:34.320]  part of having an online store. You have bigger ideas to think about. No wonder 98% of companies
[24:34.320 --> 24:39.660]  that use ship station for a year keep using it for as long as they're in business. It's that good.
[24:40.420 --> 24:46.380]  Ship more in less time with ship station. Use my offer code FACE to get a 60 day free trial.

[24:59.060 --> 25:06.520]  We all shop online. I do it, uh, well more than I probably should. Multiple times a day. And we've
[25:06.520 --> 25:12.220]  all seen that promo code field taunt us at checkout saying, uh, there are savings to be had,
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.660]  you just have no access to them. But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a
[25:17.660 --> 25:22.700]  thing of the past. Honey is a free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and
[25:22.700 --> 25:28.860]  applies the best one it finds to your cart. It's doing a lot of work for you. Honey must really
[25:28.860 --> 25:34.940]  love you. Honey supports over 30,000 stores online. I've tried my best to shop at all of them. I'm
[25:34.940 --> 25:39.720]  getting close. These range from sites that have tech and gaming products to popular fashion brands,
[25:39.740 --> 25:45.980]  that's me, to even food delivery. That was me saying because of food. Here's how it works.
[25:45.980 --> 25:50.560]  Imagine you're shopping on one or many of your favorite sites and when you go to checkout,
[25:50.800 --> 25:55.380]  the Honey button will drop down, it does it all the time, it's very convenient, and all you have
[25:55.380 --> 26:01.380]  to do is click apply coupons. Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons across the entire
[26:01.380 --> 26:08.020]  internet and then all the ones that it finds, if it finds them, boom, throws it on there and
[26:08.020 --> 26:13.320]  you watch the prices drop. So I've decided to put a moratorium on the the story about the
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.760]  paddle boards. I'm never gonna tell it again. I did save money on them. However, I'm trying to
[26:18.760 --> 26:21.740]  be current. I'm going to give you guys the things that I've been saving money on lately and I've
[26:21.740 --> 26:27.120]  been saving a lot of money lately. However, it's all bid on Christmas presents. So I'm not gonna
[26:27.660 --> 26:34.540]  spoil Christmas by saying exactly what I've purchased over the last couple days and received
[26:34.540 --> 26:42.540]  benefits from Honey, but I will say that there was a kitchenry site and maybe an online book
[26:42.540 --> 26:50.480]  retailer and a couple of other places that I have found some pretty hefty discounts on
[26:50.480 --> 26:55.640]  thanks to Honey. As a matter of fact, Honey has found its over 17 million members more than 2
[26:55.640 --> 27:00.760]  billion dollars in savings. That's the amount of money that Kendall tried to buy Logan Roy out of
[27:00.760 --> 27:05.820]  the family business for last night on Succession. Crazy. If you don't already have Honey, you could
[27:05.820 --> 27:10.680]  be straight up missing out on free savings. It is literally free and installs in a few seconds and by
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.400]  getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid and supporting this podcast. I'd never recommend
[27:15.400 --> 27:22.380]  something I don't use, so get Honey for free at joinhoney.com slash face. That is joinhoney.com
[27:22.380 --> 27:30.020]  slash face. I have a thing, a company thing to talk to you guys about that I found very amusing.
[27:30.140 --> 27:37.340]  Okay. As you know, we have the bits email that people can email in on and recently I got an
[27:37.340 --> 27:43.280]  email on it for a, I'm not going to say the company or what they sell. Well, I guess I'll
[27:43.280 --> 27:49.720]  give the type of what it is. I got an email on it for wanting to do a sponsorship with our show.
[27:49.860 --> 27:57.080]  They're a sex toy company and they want to promote a very specific product that is a blow job device.
[27:57.220 --> 28:02.860]  And I was like, this is such a fucking, why would you reach out to this email? This is so odd. I
[28:02.860 --> 28:09.860]  realized that it, we have, we have faced ourself in the sense of they think this is a face fucking
[28:09.860 --> 28:17.720]  podcast. Oh yeah. Face blow job. Yeah. Like they, I don't think they know anything about the show
[28:18.300 --> 28:23.940]  outside of the name face, which they've interpreted very literally as like, this is
[28:23.940 --> 28:29.520]  the place to sell the blowjob device. I wonder what other shit we could do with a blowjob device.
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.680]  That's not sexual. Uh, stick a bit of Velcro on it.
[28:36.220 --> 28:41.900]  I wanted to just write back and say, sorry, we're an Apple podcast, but I wanted to discuss this.
[28:42.380 --> 28:45.840]  I just thought it was so funny. Why is it you suck you off or it sucks you off? How does it work?
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.360]  It's it sucks you off. You suck it off so you can practice getting blowjobs.
[28:51.360 --> 28:59.320]  Why is that so weird? What do you mean? Why is that so weird? People suck on dildos and stuff,
[28:59.400 --> 29:09.960]  don't they? You think this is like a product by Super Soaker? What are you talking about?
[29:10.020 --> 29:16.860]  What's so weird about it? Are you sucking on a lot of dildos in your personal life? No,
[29:16.860 --> 29:20.880]  no judgment here. I'm just curious. No, I've never done it. Do you do a lot of blowjob
[29:20.880 --> 29:38.760]  practicing? No, it's not that weird. I bought this to work on my craft. This is a tool.
[29:40.420 --> 29:45.360]  I think maybe just, I think you would have said dildo is what's weird about it.
[29:45.620 --> 29:49.940]  If I think that's just as weird because you would have just said dildo. You said blowjob
[29:49.940 --> 29:58.400]  device so that's why I'm off base. I love, I just love the idea of Gavin at home going,
[29:58.400 --> 30:03.200]  I don't know how good I am at this. Well, let's see. Well, I got a 75. I wonder if I
[30:03.200 --> 30:07.600]  could beat my score tomorrow. It's like one of those machines you punch in the arcade.
[30:09.600 --> 30:12.540]  If it's something that you like put your knob in, does it really matter?
[30:13.100 --> 30:15.810]  It could be any hole, couldn't it?
[30:21.100 --> 30:24.080]  It could be any hole. Oh, Gavin.
[30:29.720 --> 30:35.460]  Do they make specific? Do they make one with like teeth and tongue and stuff?
[30:36.140 --> 30:39.480]  I don't know. I didn't expect all these questions.
[30:39.840 --> 30:41.180]  What happened? Have you seen the device?
[30:42.540 --> 30:44.300]  I don't think they included it.
[30:44.680 --> 30:49.960]  If they, if it has teeth and tongues and stuff, I have an idea. Here's a, you could use it,
[30:50.020 --> 30:55.280]  you could use it, you could use it if you have like sore teeth, like maybe you just got a cavity
[30:55.280 --> 30:59.820]  or maybe you're, you've, you're just, you know, uh, you've got weak teeth. You could use it to
[30:59.820 --> 31:05.440]  pre-chew your food for you. You stick like a piece of steak in there and then just smash
[31:05.440 --> 31:08.660]  the end together until it chews up the food and then you just drop it in your mouth like a baby
[31:08.660 --> 31:14.480]  bird. That's called a blender. Why would you want to, why would you want to mash it up in a fake
[31:14.480 --> 31:19.380]  ass? Then you'd have to brush his teeth after. I got a news for you, buddy. You're brushing
[31:19.380 --> 31:26.520]  its teeth after no matter how you use it. This is apparently what it looks like. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
[31:26.800 --> 31:32.380]  That's really detailed. It looks like a brittle water filter with a mouth on top.
[31:33.320 --> 31:36.140]  I have one of those in my fridge. It's a soda screen.
[31:36.560 --> 31:45.140]  Yeah, that looks, oh my God. Why is that? Why have they gone to all the effort to make like the chin
[31:45.140 --> 31:50.120]  and the nose? And then there's like a blue plastic below it. Like at least give it a neck. With giant
[31:50.120 --> 31:56.700]  screws. The blue neck with the giant screws really ruins the mouth illusion. Oh, it's even got,
[31:56.860 --> 32:01.760]  it's even got a little nose. Yeah. I don't, I don't, I'm not sure my toothbrush would fit in there.
[32:05.460 --> 32:13.540]  Well, I imagine it's designed for things to fit in there. So, yeah. As Eric said, I think a lot can
[32:13.540 --> 32:19.380]  fit in there and he's probably right. What a weird, what a weird direction you've taken the podcast
[32:19.380 --> 32:25.660]  in season four, Gavin. I didn't bring it. Andrew brought in this mouth shatter. I didn't, I didn't
[32:25.660 --> 32:31.280]  expect for you to go the way you did. The questions you asked, you could give me a million questions.
[32:31.280 --> 32:41.420]  I never asked what's the purpose of the device? Who's it for? Oh man. Oh, oh God. That was fun.
[32:41.420 --> 32:49.380]  Holy fuck. You're like, nevermind. I can't. Would you kiss it before or after?
[32:52.520 --> 32:58.320]  I was thinking recently of, um, you know how you, you two, uh, what was that thing you were doing
[32:58.320 --> 33:02.580]  last week or the week before where you were basically just kidding yourselves? It was like
[33:02.580 --> 33:07.960]  the, uh, having two socks and having a spare because it's like a spare instead of just buying.
[33:08.180 --> 33:13.420]  That caused a lot of inspired conversation in the, in the circle. Oh really? What was, what was the
[33:13.420 --> 33:18.460]  situation? Well, a lot of people agree with you, Gavin, that Andrew and I are way off base and
[33:18.460 --> 33:24.460]  stupid. I think that, I think that what people are missing and where my line of reasoning is, is
[33:24.460 --> 33:28.420]  obviously first off, these are unisex socks, right? They're not left or right socks. These
[33:28.420 --> 33:34.660]  are just tube socks, normal socks that don't have an L or an R on them, uh, obviously. Uh, but I
[33:34.660 --> 33:38.540]  think the, the, the problem is the way that I was approaching it that maybe I didn't articulate
[33:38.540 --> 33:46.120]  clearly is if you buy three socks and you lose a sock, you have a pair of socks still. If you buy
[33:47.120 --> 33:53.700]  four socks, what, yeah. You're saying the exact same thing. How are you articulating it different?
[33:53.700 --> 33:57.560]  That's like, this is insane. No, because it, no, because people are like, because people are like,
[33:57.600 --> 34:01.220]  no, because you'd still have two pairs of socks, but the second you lose a sock, you don't have
[34:01.220 --> 34:05.440]  two pairs of socks. So why? I don't know. I think it's brilliant. I think three socks is the way.
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.620]  Can I clarify? Can I attempt to clarify this idea as the other person that is on board with this
[34:10.620 --> 34:15.840]  thing? First of all, it costs the same amount as a singular pair of socks. So it's like you're
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.880]  getting one for, we're going in with a value. It's a bonus sock because the same price is two.
[34:20.880 --> 34:25.640]  That's where the bonus comes in. But you lose money selling it. You don't know this fucking,
[34:25.860 --> 34:29.540]  what a weird, once again, what are you, none of this is real. What do you mean I'm going to lose
[34:29.540 --> 34:34.080]  money selling it? You don't know my factory setup. You don't know the deals I've made.
[34:34.300 --> 34:39.180]  Maybe it's not all about the, the bottom line, you capitalist pig. Maybe it's about providing
[34:39.180 --> 34:49.360]  the best product for the customer. My biggest issue with it is that your main problem with
[34:49.360 --> 34:55.680]  owning two pairs of socks is that if you lose one, you end up with three. That to you is the
[34:55.680 --> 35:00.580]  problem. And you're starting your solution with that. You're saying buy the problem.
[35:02.040 --> 35:07.980]  Did Geoff leave? No, I'm listening. Oh, I'm listening. Let me, let me do another counter
[35:07.980 --> 35:14.100]  point to, to this whole thing as well. It is a spiritual argument I feel we are making as the
[35:14.100 --> 35:20.220]  sock people. On an intellectual level, you are completely correct. It's a ridiculous claim that
[35:20.220 --> 35:25.660]  we're making, but it's once again, it's like Coke tastes better in the snow. There's just a personal
[35:26.240 --> 35:33.400]  security with the third sock, right? So it's not, it's not, you're trying to win a logical debate.
[35:34.200 --> 35:36.880]  Oh, Eric's, Eric's freaking out. Eric missed that last week, I guess.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.960]  Were you not there for that, Eric? No, I think I, I think I missed that one
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.580]  about Coke tastes better in the snow. I don't remember that. That, that really, I, I'm like
[35:46.580 --> 35:50.740]  listening intently. And then you said that, and it's like, I got side-swiped.
[35:50.860 --> 35:54.500]  I don't know that I remember that either, but I don't disagree with it.
[35:54.720 --> 36:00.260]  Yeah. I was saying that if it's snowing outside, Coca-Cola is my beverage of choice. One,
[36:00.320 --> 36:04.460]  it's snowing. There's something about the atmosphere of snow coming down. It heightens
[36:04.460 --> 36:08.860]  the experience of drinking a Coke, which Gavin thought was ridiculous, strongly disagreed with.
[36:08.860 --> 36:12.620]  It's ridiculous. And then I was equating all of your, your, you're just, you're just kidding
[36:12.620 --> 36:17.280]  yourself to make yourself feel good. And I was saying how that was like the people who set
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.660]  their clocks fast to make them think that they're not late and all that stuff. And I've realized that
[36:22.660 --> 36:26.160]  I have one scenario where I do kid myself. Yeah. Yeah. What's that?
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.720]  Sometimes, well, I think I spoke to you about this on, uh, when we're playing Halo, Andrew,
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.660]  but sometimes if I'm making coffee, like I'll pour the milk in first, because if I pour the
[36:35.660 --> 36:40.620]  coffee on the milk, I don't have to stir it. It saves me wasting a spoon. Right. But sometimes I
[36:40.620 --> 36:47.240]  put in too much milk or I might not have enough coffee left in the pot. So in order to try and
[36:47.240 --> 36:52.340]  make it seem like I've got more coffee, I just pour it slower. And I realized I'm like, I'm
[36:52.340 --> 36:57.280]  stretching out the pour because it adds more hope to like, I might actually have more coffee
[36:57.280 --> 37:01.800]  if I don't just quickly pour it into the milk. Cause I don't want really milky coffee. I want,
[37:01.860 --> 37:05.360]  I want it to be the right ratio. And I realized I'm just kidding myself. I could just
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.240]  completely turn it upside down and just dump the whole lot into the milk and it'd be the same
[37:09.240 --> 37:15.720]  amount. But that is one area where I'm just, I'm just lying to my brain by just pouring it really
[37:15.720 --> 37:20.280]  slowly, hoping that there's a little bit more in there doing it that way. But that's slow. It
[37:20.280 --> 37:26.520]  heightens the experience. It heightens the experience. And it gives me hope. Yeah. That's,
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.680]  see, you know, you get it. It's not just about the destination. It's also about the journey.
[37:30.880 --> 37:34.840]  It's about how you get there. Do you have any of those like kind of strange quirks, Geoff,
[37:34.840 --> 37:41.200]  where like you do, I mean, it does nothing, but no, well, I, I sticking with the drinks and
[37:41.200 --> 37:50.040]  obviously I, I don't drink beer anymore because of the crippling alcoholism, but I will go to my
[37:50.040 --> 37:57.020]  grave saying that nothing tastes better than an ice cold beer after doing yard work on a hot summer
[37:57.020 --> 38:02.120]  day. Like beer definitely tastes better after, after you've done an hour of cutting grass,
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.480]  it's like the best, coolest, most refreshing flavor ever. Yeah. The best beer. Or three
[38:07.480 --> 38:17.240]  hours of cleaning out a fridge that broke. Speaking of breaking, did I tell you guys I
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.480]  rode my bike again for the first time in six, five weeks? How did your butt hold up? How did
[38:21.480 --> 38:28.100]  that go? Well, I didn't, I wasn't on the bike long enough to find out. I got about, uh,
[38:28.960 --> 38:36.600]  got about three miles from home and it died. So, uh, it was fine for those three miles there and
[38:36.600 --> 38:43.140]  back. But, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm about ready to sh, I'm about ready to shoot my bikes into space.
[38:43.620 --> 38:47.220]  What happened this time? Just the battery go again? Yeah, it's the, I think it's,
[38:47.300 --> 38:51.300]  so what I think is happening, if I had to guess, right, this is a refurbed battery. I have two
[38:51.300 --> 38:56.520]  refurb batteries. I'm not sure if both are having this problem or just one, but I'm so mad at all
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.820]  of it that I just, I had to walk away for a while. But when I come back to it, I'm going to
[39:00.820 --> 39:04.720]  mark this battery in a way and then do the, conduct these tests on the other battery and
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.520]  see if I just have a bad replacement battery. However, what I suspect is happening with these
[39:09.520 --> 39:13.580]  shitty cheap batteries is that, you know, the, the, the thing with a full charge supposed to
[39:13.580 --> 39:20.360]  go about 30 miles. I suspect that I plugged it in after going like 15 miles and it's just like
[39:20.920 --> 39:26.760]  the next time I wrote it, I could only go 15 miles, right? And so I think that every time I plug it
[39:26.760 --> 39:33.840]  in, uh, it just, it can only charge up to the amount that I used it because I came home after
[39:33.840 --> 39:39.120]  I walked, you know, after I fucking labored to get it home and I plugged it in really fast and it
[39:39.120 --> 39:44.320]  turned on immediately and still had like 80% of a battery. So I think it just like turns off or
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.720]  whatever when it hits that, that point when it last charged and it just needs to be, uh, plugged
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.540]  in again for one second to like re wake it back up again. So I'm even wondering if maybe I could
[39:54.540 --> 39:59.920]  have a bunch of the extra cords, if I could even like cut the end off of the plug and just bring it
[39:59.920 --> 40:03.940]  with me. And whenever the battery turns off, if I just shove it in, if that's enough, or if I have
[40:03.940 --> 40:07.680]  to bring like a whole charger with me and then just like stop somewhere and plug it in for one
[40:07.680 --> 40:10.980]  second. And then the bike's like, Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. I'm fucking, I turned off like an idiot.
[40:11.060 --> 40:15.600]  I'm totally fine. You still have 85% of your battery here, my bad. And then I can keep going.
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.500]  I suspect that's going to be the case. But, uh, if I go near that bicycle anytime soon,
[40:21.540 --> 40:24.180]  I'm gonna throw it in a fucking river. So if you just unplug the battery though,
[40:24.220 --> 40:27.480]  and plug it back in, what happens then? That doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't
[40:27.480 --> 40:31.820]  do anything. I have to literally plug it into power or put something in that thing for it to
[40:31.820 --> 40:37.060]  trigger. Hmm. That sucks. Yeah. And all of your bikes are broken. You have like three of them,
[40:37.080 --> 40:44.120]  right? Uh, well, I have three bikes, two batteries now and, uh, Millie's bike is broken.
[40:44.580 --> 40:48.960]  So I have Emily's bike in mine and two batteries on them, but you know, I wasn't able to ride the
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.320]  bike for five weeks, any of them. And so this was my first attempt back and, uh, it went dismal.
[40:55.540 --> 40:59.020]  And so I, I don't know, man, maybe I'm done with bikes. I needed to find a new,
[40:59.020 --> 41:04.080]  a new coping mechanism. I will say if, if we're talking, just trying to put a positive spin on it,
[41:04.260 --> 41:08.080]  it's good. The bike broke and not you. So that was the previous issue, right? Was that you
[41:08.080 --> 41:12.220]  couldn't ride the bike. Now the bike cannot be ridden. I'd say that's an upgrade. Yeah,
[41:12.220 --> 41:18.900]  that's true. My, my butt feels fine, you know, since then I don't have the pains that I've had.
[41:19.320 --> 41:24.780]  So that I take that as a positive. Uh, no, Eric wrote. So what you had a normal bike. I wish,
[41:24.900 --> 41:28.460]  I wish these things turned into normal bikes. When, when the electricity goes off, they don't,
[41:28.480 --> 41:34.240]  they turn into slightly movable objects. It's like an anvil with wheels. It's like an anvil
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.180]  with wheels. Yes. What if you go in there had a mechanism that you could just like disengage
[41:38.180 --> 41:45.300]  when it's dead. So it is a bike. Do they exist? You know, like the scene in the dark night where
[41:45.300 --> 41:49.880]  the Batmobile dies and it turns into like a Batmobile motorbike, like he shoots out. I love
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.940]  the idea of a bike turning into a bike, like the bike breaks. So you then just turned into
[41:54.940 --> 41:59.180]  a functional bike. The problem is, I mean, it still functions as a bike. It's just a very
[41:59.180 --> 42:04.340]  heavy bike because these batteries are fucking heavy. You know, you take the battery off and
[42:04.340 --> 42:10.020]  then it's still not a great bike, but it functions more as one. Does that totally break the Batmobile
[42:10.020 --> 42:13.780]  when that happens? Or did that, is it, did it just happen that way in the movie? Like,
[42:13.800 --> 42:17.760]  can he just bike out of the Batmobile and then, and then just drive it and like rear it back in?
[42:17.900 --> 42:22.180]  Does he like back it back into the Batmobile? I don't remember. Yeah. And also like, could both
[42:22.180 --> 42:26.380]  sides do that? Like what if you were in the passenger seat when that happens? Is it only
[42:26.380 --> 42:31.160]  one side is a bike? What does the other side do? Cause I think in the movie he gets the bike out
[42:31.160 --> 42:37.400]  after the main car's broken. Yes, he does. And it looks like it destroys itself. It is funny to
[42:37.400 --> 42:42.400]  think that like that shit always seems to work for him. Like Lucius was very good at his job,
[42:42.420 --> 42:46.880]  I guess. But like, it would be funny to see Batman after like solving the crime, trying to put the
[42:46.880 --> 42:51.540]  bike back into the fucking car and like a lash won't stick. It's like stuck in one thing. And
[42:51.540 --> 42:55.400]  he's like, he's like trying to fucking force it. And he's like, it's a piece of shit. Yeah. I would
[42:55.400 --> 42:58.540]  like to think that that happened. I would like to think that Batman has frustrations that we just
[42:58.540 --> 43:03.200]  don't see. Yeah. The everyday issues. You know, when you see in movies, there's like a broadcast
[43:03.200 --> 43:09.760]  from space or some evil villain is able to take over every TV in, in the world and broadcast a
[43:09.760 --> 43:15.180]  message. That to me is the most unrealistic, based on the, the difficulty I have, like casting
[43:15.180 --> 43:21.720]  something from my own phone to my own TV on my own wifi network. That to me is the most unrealistic
[43:21.720 --> 43:27.360]  thing in movie history that they could just take over TVs. Yeah. If they could,
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.520]  I would pay them extra money to make Hulu work in my bedroom every time.
[43:34.200 --> 43:37.620]  God damn. That's what we need to do is we need to hire super villains to fix our tech problem.
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.740]  I was about to say, it'll be like a catch me if you can thing. They get hired at the end. We need
[43:41.740 --> 43:47.000]  you to show us the way I know you're trying to poison the water reservoir, but we really need
[43:47.000 --> 43:53.360]  streaming to cut you a deal. Can you cast this for us? Technology is unbelievable. I was broken
[43:53.360 --> 44:00.360]  in a different way. Geoff last few days, my bed, my bed has been fucked. My bed has been destroyed.
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.460]  I, uh, I had a box spring that was wooden. Have you, has anyone here ever had a box spring?
[44:06.520 --> 44:11.460]  That was like wooden slats. You would lay on top. Yeah. They're the worst. They're the,
[44:11.600 --> 44:14.900]  they're the worst. At least in my experience with them, maybe you have a shitty one.
[44:14.900 --> 44:20.220]  It fucking sucks. It's constantly falling down a hole. I'll be laying in bed and all of a sudden
[44:20.220 --> 44:25.060]  I'm in a hole and it's like, I'm deep enough in a hole, you know, like in a movie where a villain
[44:25.060 --> 44:29.380]  lands on top of a car and like how it indents. It's like, that's how much of a hole I'm in.
[44:29.540 --> 44:35.780]  I'm in like a fucking car movie hole. It stinks. And it's just been that way. And I, I hurt,
[44:36.220 --> 44:42.780]  I hurt my foot shockingly. So I'm hobbling around and every fucking night I'm falling in a hole and
[44:42.780 --> 44:48.460]  I can't sleep because I'm in this fucking car hole and it sucks. So is it the slat has come
[44:48.460 --> 44:53.080]  loose or it snapped or what? Like how are you going down a hole? So some of the beams are broken
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.940]  as well as it just slides. It'll just slide off and fall down. Then I'm in a fucking hole
[44:57.940 --> 45:03.240]  and it stinks. But your head is still on eight pillows. My head is still on eight pillows.
[45:03.360 --> 45:10.540]  My legs are propped up. My midsection is in a fucking hole. It's the worst. Can't sleep like a
[45:11.540 --> 45:19.860]  Yeah, you do. I do. That's exactly right. I would try. Sleep is a strong word too. It's really
[45:19.860 --> 45:24.740]  tough to sleep. And it'll be like 3am. I'll make a slight movement. It's like the scene in Jurassic
[45:24.740 --> 45:28.540]  world two, you know, with the glass where they can't move because it's denting. Like that's me
[45:28.540 --> 45:40.240]  in my bed. And then I inevitably fall in the fucking hole no matter what I do. I'm just
[45:40.820 --> 45:45.120]  So this has been an issue for a while. And I eventually I just said, you know what? Enough
[45:45.120 --> 45:50.660]  is a fucking I can't take this anymore. I'm just going to my original plan was to flip because the
[45:50.660 --> 45:56.580]  slats are on two sides, the bottom bed slats and the top bed slats. Bottom bed slats are kind of
[45:56.580 --> 46:01.160]  fine. It's like you roll them out like there's two sections of wood that you roll out for the
[46:01.160 --> 46:07.400]  slat part of it. Oh, yours is in two halves? Mine's in two halves, which makes it, I think,
[46:07.400 --> 46:12.500]  another issue where it separates. The halves meet right in the middle. So like, yeah, it's a
[46:12.500 --> 46:16.240]  constant. I'm fucking falling in holes all the time while I'm just trying to sleep. I've had
[46:16.240 --> 46:21.280]  halves where it's left and right. No, this is this is top down. Are you sure you don't sleep
[46:21.280 --> 46:26.760]  to go to bed sideways? I don't. OK, well, we're going to we're going to get to that anyway.
[46:27.380 --> 46:34.140]  Oh no! I de-assemble the bed because I'm going to flip them and I realize how fucking broken
[46:34.140 --> 46:37.720]  this thing is. This thing is more broken than I realize. There's all the wood is cracked.
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.120]  Everything's fucking destroyed. I've had this for a long time at this point. So I was like,
[46:42.160 --> 46:45.600]  I'm just going to get rid of it, going to throw it all away. But I need a box spring.
[46:45.900 --> 46:50.160]  And I have a king size bed, which is, I don't know, five years ago. I was like, you know what?
[46:50.160 --> 46:54.040]  I'm going to really treat myself. I typically don't buy things for me. I'm going to use my
[46:54.040 --> 46:59.520]  bed a lot. I'm going to go all out. I'm getting a fucking king. But it's the only king size I have.
[46:59.540 --> 47:03.600]  I have one other queen in the spare room. No wonder it takes up your entire room. King size
[47:03.600 --> 47:09.020]  bed for one person. It's fucking it's great. It's a fantastic. I would highly recommend it.
[47:09.200 --> 47:15.100]  So I brought in this queen size box spring, but I have this other problem now where it doesn't fit
[47:15.100 --> 47:21.540]  on the box spring. And so I'm having to sleep very carefully. I'm so every time I go to bed now,
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.920]  I'm in the middle. I'm so nervous. I'm going to roll. If I roll a little bit to the left or right,
[47:25.940 --> 47:31.740]  I'm fucking just flying out of this bed. So that's width ways. That's not the end of the bed.
[47:31.740 --> 47:37.860]  That's the side of the bed. That's the side of the bed, which has led to me realizing I've had
[47:37.860 --> 47:44.700]  my bed on sideways this entire time. And I would highly recommend anyone with a king size bed
[47:44.700 --> 47:51.120]  because it's large enough where you can have it on its side. I have more width than I do length.
[47:51.300 --> 47:58.020]  I'm like five foot ten. It works great. I feel like I it's genuinely like half my bed is in
[47:58.020 --> 48:02.800]  different state when I lay in it. You have so much space. I would highly recommend it.
[48:03.220 --> 48:06.560]  So because of this, I've learned that I've been sleeping on my bed sideways. But now with what
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.040]  you guys have brought up, maybe I've had the slats on the wrong way the entire time, too.
[48:11.360 --> 48:16.340]  Maybe my bed has been twisted. I don't know if that's true. I need I'm going to look at
[48:16.340 --> 48:21.380]  the company that I bought this from and see if they've got it installed. No, it doesn't look
[48:21.380 --> 48:26.740]  like that. Eric just posted this. It's the top one, the top slats. It's the way it goes.
[48:26.740 --> 48:31.860]  And my head, but it's not it's not those kind. Top slats. So it goes top, top down. I'll just
[48:31.860 --> 48:37.280]  post a link to the thing that I use. But yeah, I've been my my life hack is if you have a king
[48:37.280 --> 48:43.320]  bed, which I know is a luxury, flip it on its side, sleep the other way. It is a great experience.
[48:43.400 --> 48:48.460]  You have so much extra space, but that's how I've been broken. But so falling in holes, Geoff, you
[48:48.460 --> 48:55.020]  you. Oh, I just feel like you'd want more length, though. And you do travel. You don't need length
[48:55.020 --> 49:01.780]  is overrated. Length is overrated. Well, length is good. Well, I'm never going to grow taller in
[49:01.780 --> 49:05.800]  bed. Yeah, but sometimes I might roll. You ever like sort of you're on your back in bed and then
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.140]  sometimes you want to like push you want to turn over on your front and like push on the headboard
[49:10.140 --> 49:14.300]  so you slide down a little bit and you just sort of in the bottom of your pillow and then you
[49:14.300 --> 49:18.540]  appreciate that your legs don't dangle off the end of the mattress. Yeah, I've never had my legs
[49:18.540 --> 49:23.600]  dangle. First of all. Second of all, I've never pushed down on the pillow. The only time I've
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.780]  had my legs dangle is when I fucked up and like laid in the middle of the bed. But at appropriate
[49:28.780 --> 49:33.840]  pillow height, I'd say within pillow regulation of where they should be. I've never dangled.
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.360]  Yeah, I guess you are halfway up a pillow mountain. That'll bring your feet in.
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.820]  No. OK, so I'm looking at the thing. I did it correctly. It's not I'm not crazy. It's just it's
[49:45.820 --> 49:51.860]  a shitty design. Yeah, I don't like those slats beds because you can't stand on the bed, really,
[49:51.860 --> 49:58.680]  if you need to. No, you just hear it cracking. It's terrible. Do you stand on a lot of beds?
[49:59.220 --> 50:03.860]  I mean, you're changing a light. Gavin strikes me as a guy who loves to jump on the bed. No,
[50:03.940 --> 50:08.740]  I'm not a jumper. I just, you know, sometimes standing on the bed is useful for like
[50:08.740 --> 50:12.480]  changing a light. Hmm. Oh, that's pretty much it.
[50:13.140 --> 50:14.740]  Please, you have to use it.
[50:17.120 --> 50:23.660]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I have. Was the last thing we recorded the tuxedo or was it the podcast?
[50:24.220 --> 50:28.780]  There was a podcast. We did one. We did a podcast after the tuxedo. OK, we did. It was a back to
[50:28.780 --> 50:33.720]  back one. Is that that's the one where you you had your tech problems? Yes. I don't I couldn't
[50:33.720 --> 50:39.060]  tell you what was happening in that episode, but we did record the most broken episode of the show
[50:39.060 --> 50:43.960]  because of the law. Did the law ever come out? The law has come out. I've been working on it.
[50:44.020 --> 50:47.600]  I'm looking. I've been trying to figure out loopholes for us, for this get out of jail
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.260]  free scenario. I like I tweeted. I just wanted to print the law. And somebody immediately replied.
[50:53.400 --> 50:58.160]  And the law won. That's like you have no idea how accurate that is. You couldn't have summarized it
[50:58.160 --> 51:04.080]  perfectly. So what are you guys going to do for New Year's? Because we're recording this on December
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.980]  30th. I'm going to be snowed in. So I'm going to be most likely wishing I could order McDonald's
[51:08.980 --> 51:13.960]  but can't waiting for for Steve and the Bobcat to ride by. Well, maybe it's maybe it's time that
[51:13.960 --> 51:20.100]  you learn how to make your favorite McDonald's item at home. There is. I mean, if we want to
[51:20.100 --> 51:24.300]  talk fast food controversy, there's a big controversy in Canada right now with Tim Hortons
[51:24.300 --> 51:29.660]  because they've released a new menu item in Mexico and people are like, fucking I want it.
[51:29.820 --> 51:33.980]  It's Canadian. I think it's owned by Burger King. It's not even a Canadian chain anymore, but people
[51:33.980 --> 51:41.920]  were outraged by it. The new item was like a sausage and an egg patty or whatever. Sausage
[51:41.920 --> 51:47.040]  patty. Is it an egg patty? What do you call the like the McMuffin egg? Is that a patty? Fried egg.
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.940]  Fried egg. Between two Eggo waffles is the whole thing. Like the Eggo is the bread is their idea.
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.660]  And people are fucking outraged about this. I don't understand why anyone's mad. An Eggo isn't
[51:57.660 --> 52:02.600]  a fucking inaccessible item. You can buy them anywhere. You can. It's the most easily
[52:02.600 --> 52:08.300]  creatable fast food item in your home you could ever have. Just buy a box of Eggos and buy one
[52:08.300 --> 52:13.120]  of their sausage McMuffins and you have everything. Yeah, but isn't a regular McMuffin easy to make
[52:13.120 --> 52:19.160]  too? I guess, but I feel like you can maybe have some variance in the meat or the egg. Like the
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.280]  Eggo is just an egg. There's nothing special about that egg. Oh, so they're just getting,
[52:23.480 --> 52:27.800]  they're not making Eggos, they're just getting shipments of Eggos. No, they are just using
[52:27.800 --> 52:34.040]  Eggo Eggos. I don't understand it. It's a very weird food controversy that is happening. It
[52:34.040 --> 52:38.160]  looks good though. It looks fine, but it's just, I don't understand why people are like,
[52:38.280 --> 52:42.740]  why can't we have this? Fucking go buy some Eggos. You can create this. Three minutes.
[52:43.600 --> 52:47.120]  So easy. Well, you can do the same thing with an Egg McMuffin. You just need to go buy English
[52:47.120 --> 52:52.420]  muffins, a sausage patty and a slice of cheese and an egg. An English muffin is just as easy to
[52:52.420 --> 52:57.700]  come by as Eggo waffles. No, it's, it's a different thing because it's not a McDonald's egg. It's not
[52:57.700 --> 53:03.460]  McDonald's cheese, like all those things. You don't, you don't know. It's probably superior in
[53:03.460 --> 53:08.540]  every way than those ingredients. You can't come. Oh, come on. McDonald's has the best Coke,
[53:08.580 --> 53:12.300]  so they might have the best eggs. I can't rule that out. I don't know what their egg plan is.
[53:12.860 --> 53:17.760]  I'm just saying that there are unique specific items that you can get only there. A McDonald's
[53:17.760 --> 53:23.240]  egg tastes different than a Burger King egg, or I'm assuming Wendy's has eggs in their breakfast
[53:23.240 --> 53:28.100]  menu. Cause I know that I don't, we don't have breakfast menu in Canada for Wendy's. Do they,
[53:28.300 --> 53:33.340]  they really have the best Coke? Yeah, they do. They like pay a premium to have the best Coke.
[53:33.440 --> 53:38.220]  They like get it specially delivered and store it in a unique way. And that's also why their
[53:38.220 --> 53:43.080]  straws are larger than any other fast food chain straws. They made like an investment a few years
[53:43.080 --> 53:48.440]  ago and like, we will have the definitive best Coke experience of any fast food chain. What does
[53:48.440 --> 53:53.540]  that have to do with the straws? It's not thicker Coke. Well, I guess because it's a larger straw,
[53:53.660 --> 53:59.880]  it hits more taste buds per sip is the idea. It's like part of the drinking experience.
[54:00.440 --> 54:03.840]  There's the whole Coke thing. So I don't know, maybe their eggs are as involved too. You wouldn't
[54:03.840 --> 54:09.540]  think that a chain would specify something like Coke, but it's just annoying. It's frustrating.
[54:10.160 --> 54:13.820]  Have you, this is going to seem like a random question. Geoff, do you storm out of rooms
[54:13.820 --> 54:19.440]  in arguments? Yeah, I've done it on this podcast. You've stormed, I guess you have, haven't you?
[54:19.500 --> 54:23.280]  I realized I'm not a stormer. I can't, I was trying to think of a time. I've done it on camera.
[54:23.540 --> 54:27.640]  I was trying to think of a time in which I've stormed out in an argument with anyone. Yeah,
[54:27.660 --> 54:32.400]  this is a conversation we had during Halo when we were talking about, I think I was talking about
[54:32.400 --> 54:36.000]  like what it must've been like to storm Normandy and stuff. And you were just like, I don't think
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.180]  I've ever stormed anywhere. Yeah, I've never, I don't think I've stormed in my life in any
[54:41.180 --> 54:45.980]  context. You said that you'd like slammed a door open or closed, but you'd never made the
[54:45.980 --> 54:51.240]  transition across the different rooms. And we decided that storming, you had to move between
[54:51.240 --> 54:56.940]  rooms at a minimum. Why do you think people storm out of a room? I think, well, okay. So I have a
[54:56.940 --> 55:01.360]  theory on this and maybe it's just, I'm applying it to my, my personal life. And this has made
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.960]  me realize something I don't like about myself, Geoff, is I feel like the storm occurs when you
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.820]  have hit a peak in the argument and that person's opinion, and they just need to leave. They just
[55:11.820 --> 55:16.880]  need space. And then they, they walk out. I think it's like, I've hit a max. So I'm leaving this
[55:16.880 --> 55:22.060]  because I can no longer engage in this. And I hate that because I'd rather just for me personally,
[55:22.120 --> 55:27.120]  how I operate, it's like, well, that nothing has been solved by the storm. The storm has not solved
[55:27.120 --> 55:33.200]  this conflict. So I've realized, go ahead. Well, I've just got my experience with storming is a
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.840]  little different, but go ahead. That's fair. As I said, I think it's probably just my experience
[55:36.840 --> 55:43.000]  with storming. I've realized I'm a storm chaser, Geoff. I feel like I hate it. That's my biggest
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.540]  annoyance with this. You don't want to be a storm chaser. And that's my annoyance with the storm
[55:47.540 --> 55:53.420]  is not only is it unsettled. I know you're now forcing me to move. You're now forcing me to
[55:53.420 --> 55:57.780]  change my scenery. It's like a reverse. I'm chasing the storm. I don't like it. But what's
[55:57.780 --> 56:05.100]  the best outcome? If someone's storming out, they want to be alone or away from you. Yeah. They're
[56:05.100 --> 56:09.960]  like the storm. No, you got to let the storm settle. It depends on the storm. You got to let
[56:09.960 --> 56:14.720]  it you don't run into the high of a hurricane. You got to like let it calm down a little bit.
[56:14.880 --> 56:19.620]  You got to let things settle. But ultimately, things are still unresolved. So you got to clear
[56:19.620 --> 56:23.800]  things up. You got to clean it up a little bit. So then I end up chasing the storm eventually.
[56:23.900 --> 56:27.860]  Yeah, you're just defeating the storm because the storm needs to settle without you.
[56:28.300 --> 56:33.780]  Yeah, you're causing the storm. Listen, I've I've been in the eyes of many storms and I've
[56:33.780 --> 56:38.420]  always come out correct on the other side. I've got a great read for storm entry and leaving.
[56:38.580 --> 56:40.900]  I want to know why you're pissing all these people off.
[56:44.980 --> 56:49.440]  I can't believe you've never stormed out of anywhere. I can't think of a time in which I
[56:49.440 --> 56:53.500]  have. You said you open a door hard or you did you open or close it and you like hurt your foot
[56:53.500 --> 56:58.020]  or something? Yeah, I like opened it in frustration because it was like seven different things were
[56:58.020 --> 57:02.620]  all going wrong. But you're not counting that as a as a storm and slammed it. No, that's not
[57:02.620 --> 57:06.760]  because I didn't leave. I didn't leave my space. Even if you couldn't storm into a cabinet
[57:06.760 --> 57:11.940]  because you can't get in there. It's a walk in pantry, maybe.
[57:13.300 --> 57:18.060]  Just for the record, if I ever storm out of a room with either of you, and I've probably done it with
[57:18.060 --> 57:26.460]  you a few times, Gavin, in person. I think you stormed in a lot. Yeah, I remember I remember
[57:26.460 --> 57:33.760]  one time yelling at you, you specifically and you guys in Achievement Hunter during a production.
[57:34.020 --> 57:41.360]  It was and I think I stormed out that time. But when like for me, when I storm out, I'm doing it
[57:41.360 --> 57:48.000]  for you because I have hit a point where I'm going to say something and I can't like I'm a pretty
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.380]  controlled dude for the most part. But I get to a point when I get angry enough that my mouth will
[57:53.380 --> 58:00.920]  say shit that I know I shouldn't say that I get too mean or too angry. I could be too hurtful.
[58:01.240 --> 58:06.580]  So when I storm out of a room, I'm trying to stop myself from from saying something so mean
[58:06.580 --> 58:12.540]  or hurtful that it could cause repercussions later. So I'm like I'm trying to like I'm trying
[58:12.540 --> 58:16.940]  to get away from the situation because I can feel my mouth about to get away from me.
[58:17.300 --> 58:21.120]  Can I say this, Geoff? If that were the case, if I was in that scenario with you,
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.140]  I would know not to fall. I would let that storm cool off a little bit. I wouldn't I wouldn't
[58:25.140 --> 58:30.600]  immediately pursue. That's like the cow in Twister. You know, like when it's coming by, you've hit
[58:30.600 --> 58:35.420]  peak. You're not going in to a cow storm. Yeah, you don't want to be dodging cows. No, you don't.
[58:35.520 --> 58:40.340]  What a great movie that is. I fucking love Twister. What maybe that. Oh, what a dumb.
[58:40.580 --> 58:46.120]  Philip Seymour Hoffman is so good in that movie. The extreme. So obnoxious. So dumb.
[58:46.120 --> 58:52.760]  Yeah, I feel like I feel like I'm a silent stormer. Like I storm out. You wouldn't you
[58:52.760 --> 58:57.340]  wouldn't realize I'm like an Irish stormer. I'm an Irish storm. I just quietly leave.
[58:57.860 --> 59:02.660]  Very polite Irish storm. Jesus. I'm not swinging doors around.
[59:05.900 --> 59:12.740]  I want like a weather report. You know how that movie feels like that movie must have come out 20
[59:12.740 --> 59:18.800]  years ago at this point or around 2000, wasn't it? A lot of people in that movie are dead now.
[59:18.880 --> 59:23.320]  They are. That's sad, Philip. Yeah. Philip Seymour Hoffman is dead. Paxton's dead.
[59:24.980 --> 59:27.820]  Anyone else or is it just the two of them? There's still quite a few. I'm sure there's
[59:27.820 --> 59:30.460]  other people that were involved in the film that have died. I guarantee you.
[59:30.820 --> 59:35.660]  Absolutely. Yeah, 100 percent. My favorite thing about that movie is that the villains are the
[59:35.660 --> 59:39.860]  villains because they have corporate sponsorship. It's like the only real difference between the
[59:39.860 --> 59:45.940]  two. They're not in it just for the thrill of the storm. They've gone corporate. How dare they?
[59:46.540 --> 59:52.320]  And then they treat them like real villains, like they do some harsh things to those characters.
[59:53.800 --> 59:57.480]  And maybe my memory is wrong, but are they the least villainous villains in a movie?
[59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.980]  I think they're assholes, but I think like largely their conflict is is based around
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.920]  the fact that they have income, that they're being paid to like chase storms and they got fancy
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:11.900]  vehicles. They do have fancy vehicles. Corporate sponsorship. It's such a dumb the fucking the
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.380]  story. Do you know why he's the extreme? Because he dropped a bottle of Jack Daniels and it never
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:22.480]  hit the ground. It's so fucking dumb. It's a great movie. Does he die in that movie? Who?
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.280]  Hoffman. Hoffman? No, no, none of the good guys die. Just the bad guys because they're
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.380]  they're corporate. Isn't there a good guy that gets dinged in the head with like a hubcap or
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:45.900]  something? I've never heard a death be described more comedically. I don't want to go out by ding.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.320]  I don't want to be dinged to death. Dinged by hubcap.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.420]  Goddamn. This is fun. Yeah, this was good. It was nice to sneak a little one out right before
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.480]  the end of the year. And I I'm sad to hear that you're going to be snowed in. I hope you make
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.680]  the most of it. I'm I'm going to go swimming because it's really hot. I rented a house with
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.240]  a pool. So I'm just going to go swimming for a couple of days. Gavin, I assume you're going to
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:20.540]  ring in the new year practicing your blowjobs. Happy New Year.
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:28.820]  Gurgle, gurgle. See you in 2022. Hey, guys. Superfan Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:35.240]  episode of F*** Face. It's season four, episode three. The boys talk about a new intro song.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:41.440]  Canada is a bottom tier country. Andrew makes friends with a seal. The guys make a tuxedo
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.160]  friend. Geoff makes someone uncomfortable. And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.980]  or walk a marathon. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
