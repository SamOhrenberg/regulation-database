[00:14.590 --> 00:19.810]  Can I tell you my super lame Watch the Throne idea I've had for a long time?
[00:20.110 --> 00:24.190]  I always thought, when I was younger, I always thought it would be such a fucking cool thing
[00:24.190 --> 00:29.990]  if somebody who was a champion of like a boxing champion or like an MMA fighter champion
[00:29.990 --> 00:34.450]  defended their album to the entire Watch the Throne CD and then retired at the end of it.
[00:34.710 --> 00:38.890]  Like every defense was a different song of Watch the Throne and then they retired at the end.
[00:38.890 --> 00:42.370]  That was my like fan fiction for boxing.
[00:42.830 --> 00:45.570]  Fan fiction for boxing.
[00:45.850 --> 00:47.950]  It's essentially fan fiction for boxing.
[00:48.350 --> 00:51.410]  And I mean, I'm not writing it down, but it's the same idea of like as a kid being like,
[00:51.490 --> 00:52.850]  this is fucking, this would be cool.
[00:53.190 --> 00:54.110]  Imagine if someone did this.
[00:54.650 --> 00:55.070]  Hello.
[00:55.850 --> 00:56.270]  Hi Gavin.
[00:56.630 --> 00:57.330]  Hey, what's up?
[00:57.510 --> 00:57.750]  Hi Geoff.
[00:58.210 --> 00:58.590]  What's up?
[00:59.130 --> 00:59.710]  Hey, what's up?
[00:59.730 --> 01:00.510]  Let's talk about music.
[01:01.030 --> 01:01.730]  I know.
[01:01.870 --> 01:04.110]  I've been listening to a lot of Vanessa Carlton recently.
[01:04.530 --> 01:05.470]  And there's a whole thing.
[01:06.010 --> 01:08.310]  Annie is just a ripoff of My Bittersweet Symphony.
[01:08.810 --> 01:09.870]  Or at least part of it is.
[01:10.010 --> 01:10.470]  It's odd.
[01:10.550 --> 01:11.430]  It's a fascinating one.
[01:12.130 --> 01:14.470]  Banes accidentally steals songs from each other.
[01:14.970 --> 01:16.750]  But Bittersweet Symphony is a ripoff.
[01:17.210 --> 01:19.510]  Sometimes they on purpose steal songs from each other.
[01:19.670 --> 01:22.010]  I present to you the entirety of Led Zeppelin.
[01:23.250 --> 01:24.130]  That's fair.
[01:24.850 --> 01:26.830]  What do you mean by My Bittersweet Symphony?
[01:27.230 --> 01:27.950]  Is that a thing?
[01:28.190 --> 01:29.010]  Are you fucking with me?
[01:29.570 --> 01:30.890]  Are you asking about Bittersweet Symphony?
[01:31.410 --> 01:34.130]  Yeah, I feel like you could be Peter Stormaring me right now.
[01:34.130 --> 01:37.710]  This feels very Stormarish where I don't quite have...
[01:37.710 --> 01:43.330]  It's like a weird instrumental version of a Rolling Stones song that they recreated.
[01:43.330 --> 01:47.310]  Which also leaves the door open to be stolen from somebody else.
[01:47.370 --> 01:52.350]  So we might not be able to track the origin of it.
[01:52.430 --> 01:54.270]  Was that the song, Bittersweet Symphony?
[01:54.630 --> 01:55.890]  And I'll have to apologize.
[01:56.550 --> 01:58.690]  I wasn't super into that kind of music at that time.
[01:58.710 --> 01:59.650]  So I don't know it very well.
[01:59.810 --> 02:03.530]  But wasn't that the song that they ended up losing all their fucking royalties to the Rolling Stones over?
[02:03.530 --> 02:05.870]  I don't know. I don't know anything about it.
[02:05.930 --> 02:08.110]  They didn't end up making any money off the song?
[02:08.570 --> 02:10.210]  I thought it was a U2 song.
[02:10.290 --> 02:15.070]  I think at some point they gave it back to the Verve guy.
[02:16.250 --> 02:17.490]  Oh, like we don't need this?
[02:17.490 --> 02:18.870]  They gave the royalties back a couple years ago.
[02:18.870 --> 02:22.130]  Is that like a power move? Be like, we don't need this song. You can have it.
[02:22.250 --> 02:26.330]  Or like, we've made all the money on it now and we're about to die so feel free.
[02:27.790 --> 02:30.550]  I don't think I can name three Rolling Stones songs.
[02:31.550 --> 02:32.750]  I'm not a big Rolling Stones guy.
[02:32.750 --> 02:34.490]  Well, hold on to that.
[02:34.710 --> 02:35.650]  Let me intro.
[02:36.270 --> 02:40.490]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:40.930 --> 02:46.150]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me always, Gavin Free, the Brit, and Andrew Panton, the Canada guy.
[02:46.810 --> 02:48.750]  And you are listening to episode...
[02:50.370 --> 02:50.930]  Season...
[02:50.930 --> 02:51.930]  Fuck.
[02:52.590 --> 02:53.890]  What season? Season 4?
[02:53.950 --> 02:54.770]  Season 4.
[02:56.690 --> 02:58.570]  Episode 3 or 2.
[02:59.150 --> 03:00.670]  Well, yeah, episode 3.
[03:00.670 --> 03:02.790]  Season 4, episode 3...
[03:02.790 --> 03:03.570]  Technically 2 and a half.
[03:03.750 --> 03:10.390]  Season 4, episode 3, overall episode 86, I believe.
[03:11.090 --> 03:13.410]  So have fun making sense of that.
[03:13.790 --> 03:18.770]  Why do we get introduced as Brit and Canada person but you don't say what you are?
[03:20.010 --> 03:21.090]  I'm an American baby.
[03:21.530 --> 03:22.650]  I'll tell you what, I'll tell you why.
[03:22.850 --> 03:23.730]  Geoff, American man.
[03:23.770 --> 03:26.750]  I'll tell you what, when you do the intro, you do it.
[03:27.650 --> 03:28.070]  American baby.
[03:28.070 --> 03:28.110]  American baby.
[03:28.570 --> 03:30.510]  America is default, says Eric.
[03:32.030 --> 03:33.790]  America is default, I agree with Eric.
[03:34.170 --> 03:39.230]  When you do the intro, which I highly encourage you to do any time you want.
[03:39.410 --> 03:39.750]  Done a few.
[03:40.190 --> 03:41.810]  Do it however the fuck you want.
[03:42.430 --> 03:45.050]  I don't think I've ever heard, I mean, you say you have.
[03:45.290 --> 03:47.750]  There's not, I don't have a memory of a Gavin intro.
[03:47.990 --> 03:49.270]  I'm sure it's recorded somewhere.
[03:49.830 --> 03:51.550]  I don't know if that's true, Gavin.
[03:51.670 --> 03:53.330]  I think you've done some outros.
[03:53.690 --> 03:56.010]  I don't think I've ever heard you do an intro.
[03:56.010 --> 03:58.790]  This sounds like a bet over the past.
[03:58.970 --> 04:00.610]  Who's gonna win, and what are the stakes?
[04:00.970 --> 04:02.090]  I bet you 10 grand I've done an intro.
[04:03.110 --> 04:03.470]  No!
[04:04.890 --> 04:05.470]  10 grand.
[04:05.490 --> 04:07.350]  Jesus Christ, out the gate.
[04:07.390 --> 04:08.270]  I'm pretty confident.
[04:10.370 --> 04:13.370]  Could somebody, Nick, could you message me on the side?
[04:13.370 --> 04:14.370]  Nah, don't bring Nick into this.
[04:15.010 --> 04:18.050]  Can you give me a statistics, like the odds of...
[04:18.050 --> 04:21.750]  You're gonna cut Nick in, you're like, I'll give you a grand if you help me make this happen.
[04:21.970 --> 04:23.490]  Go back and edit the old episodes.
[04:23.490 --> 04:25.290]  Oh, there you go.
[04:26.690 --> 04:29.130]  Oh, Nick has pulled the percentages.
[04:29.530 --> 04:32.850]  Yeah, US is default, according to this list.
[04:33.410 --> 04:34.510]  Do you wanna go through it, Gavin?
[04:35.070 --> 04:37.870]  United States, 68%.
[04:37.870 --> 04:39.350]  UK, woo!
[04:40.430 --> 04:41.150]  11%.
[04:41.150 --> 04:42.290]  Canada, 9.
[04:42.410 --> 04:44.690]  Wow, we've got the top three.
[04:45.270 --> 04:46.150]  Not bad.
[04:46.810 --> 04:48.750]  Representing our respective countries.
[04:49.690 --> 04:51.290]  Why Canada guy?
[04:51.290 --> 04:53.590]  What did you say for Gavin? It felt wordy.
[04:53.890 --> 04:56.230]  Well, here's what I said.
[04:56.450 --> 04:57.750]  Because Canadian exists.
[04:58.290 --> 04:58.770]  You know what?
[04:59.230 --> 05:01.450]  If you get Canada into second place, I'll call you a Canadian.
[05:01.630 --> 05:03.950]  But until then, you're just a Canada guy at 9%.
[05:03.950 --> 05:07.070]  11% gets you the proper nomenclature.
[05:07.670 --> 05:08.930]  Okay, I can live with that.
[05:09.110 --> 05:10.610]  I'm gonna figure this out.
[05:11.070 --> 05:12.650]  I'm gonna somehow work the system.
[05:12.790 --> 05:14.610]  New Zealand, 1%.
[05:15.090 --> 05:17.070]  Yeah, well, I wonder who that person is.
[05:18.490 --> 05:19.470]  That's pretty high.
[05:19.470 --> 05:22.030]  A whole percent for tiny little New Zealand?
[05:22.170 --> 05:23.330]  It's not even on most of the maps.
[05:23.870 --> 05:25.510]  Yeah, we also have 1% in Ireland.
[05:26.210 --> 05:27.250]  Didn't expect that.
[05:27.830 --> 05:28.750]  What an exciting time.
[05:29.570 --> 05:31.270]  What place would you least like to visit?
[05:31.390 --> 05:32.110]  That's on this list.
[05:32.670 --> 05:33.750]  Okay, well the list...
[05:33.750 --> 05:37.750]  So the list is United States, United Kingdom,
[05:37.910 --> 05:38.910]  Canada, Australia.
[05:39.270 --> 05:41.370]  Which, by the way, thanks Australia, 6%. Appreciate it.
[05:41.790 --> 05:43.310]  New Zealand, Sweden, Ireland,
[05:43.490 --> 05:44.690]  Netherlands, Norway, Germany.
[05:45.330 --> 05:47.390]  That's one place I've never been to on that list.
[05:47.390 --> 05:48.190]  Really?
[05:48.550 --> 05:49.790]  Oh, let's guess.
[05:51.230 --> 05:52.710]  Came up in conversation
[05:53.120 --> 05:54.270]  in a recent episode.
[05:54.710 --> 05:56.990]  There's two in my mind that are very, like,
[05:57.050 --> 05:58.390]  obviously bottom tier.
[05:59.890 --> 06:01.640]  I'm just judging other countries.
[06:02.910 --> 06:03.790]  Just by name.
[06:04.290 --> 06:05.090]  Just by name?
[06:05.350 --> 06:07.490]  I feel like my perception
[06:07.490 --> 06:09.390]  of Norway is that they're always
[06:09.390 --> 06:11.370]  in the Olympics, but they always place
[06:11.370 --> 06:12.610]  like 7th.
[06:13.130 --> 06:14.130]  They're a 7th place.
[06:14.130 --> 06:15.150]  In the Olympic performance.
[06:15.450 --> 06:17.090]  No, but good enough to, like, they're there.
[06:17.290 --> 06:19.250]  They're on the first graphic, typically.
[06:19.690 --> 06:21.990]  But I feel like I rarely see a Norway win.
[06:22.470 --> 06:24.010]  That is the one country I've never been to.
[06:24.550 --> 06:25.230]  There we go!
[06:25.630 --> 06:27.770]  I was trying to figure out...
[06:28.210 --> 06:29.450]  I'd love to go there, though.
[06:29.710 --> 06:31.370]  We've been to Germany together,
[06:31.550 --> 06:33.550]  we've been to the Netherlands together,
[06:33.770 --> 06:34.990]  we've been to Australia,
[06:36.450 --> 06:37.250]  the UK...
[06:37.250 --> 06:38.430]  We have been to America together.
[06:38.550 --> 06:41.510]  Yeah, the Mexican restaurant conversation, that's right.
[06:43.470 --> 06:43.950]  Chickpeas
[06:43.950 --> 06:45.250]  and, uh,
[06:46.310 --> 06:47.250]  celery in the burrito.
[06:47.710 --> 06:48.450]  Yeah, in Norway.
[06:49.450 --> 06:51.430]  I feel like of all the countries listed,
[06:51.670 --> 06:53.770]  I'm most likely to get lost in the Netherlands.
[06:54.530 --> 06:55.490]  There's just something
[06:55.490 --> 06:57.990]  about the name that I don't trust myself in.
[06:58.450 --> 06:59.630]  I think if I went
[06:59.630 --> 07:01.610]  to the Netherlands, I wouldn't come back alive.
[07:01.990 --> 07:03.270]  I think I would die in the Netherlands.
[07:06.170 --> 07:06.910]  For what?
[07:06.950 --> 07:08.530]  I don't know!
[07:08.530 --> 07:10.710]  I just don't trust myself
[07:10.710 --> 07:11.590]  in the Netherlands.
[07:12.010 --> 07:14.430]  How are you going to die? From their socialized medicine
[07:14.430 --> 07:15.550]  and superior healthcare?
[07:16.210 --> 07:18.150]  No, I'm sure it's a great actual place,
[07:18.250 --> 07:19.670]  but there's something...
[07:19.670 --> 07:22.690]  This is going to sound fucking crazy.
[07:23.230 --> 07:24.430]  Do you ever look at a thing
[07:24.430 --> 07:26.530]  and then process a whole
[07:26.530 --> 07:28.450]  scenario in your head that could play out but won't?
[07:29.070 --> 07:30.210]  Like, I could just see...
[07:30.210 --> 07:32.410]  When I look at Netherlands, I process a world
[07:32.410 --> 07:34.450]  in which I'm dead by the end of my trip.
[07:34.630 --> 07:35.170]  Three days in.
[07:35.170 --> 07:37.090]  That's pretty severe catastrophizing.
[07:37.550 --> 07:39.260]  I had that recently with a seal.
[07:40.310 --> 07:41.490]  I saw a seal.
[07:41.990 --> 07:43.270]  I saw a photo of a seal
[07:43.270 --> 07:43.810]  in a hole.
[07:44.210 --> 07:45.570]  Did you just go, I'll lose that fight?
[07:45.970 --> 07:47.650]  No, so I asked...
[07:47.650 --> 07:50.770]  It was like a gif of a seal poking its head
[07:50.770 --> 07:52.150]  up and down from a hole.
[07:52.750 --> 07:54.550]  And it was like, oh, look at how cute this seal is.
[07:54.570 --> 07:56.190]  And I thought, well, if I was there,
[07:56.870 --> 07:58.190]  I respect animals.
[07:58.370 --> 08:00.050]  They're terrifying to me.
[08:00.110 --> 08:01.890]  I once had a panic attack with my cat.
[08:01.890 --> 08:02.790]  You gotta be aware.
[08:03.810 --> 08:05.410]  Animals are a crazy thing.
[08:06.310 --> 08:07.330]  So I was like, well,
[08:07.490 --> 08:09.390]  what would I have done?
[08:09.950 --> 08:11.230]  They're like, oh, this is cute.
[08:11.330 --> 08:13.150]  And my head would be like, we gotta fucking go.
[08:13.670 --> 08:15.710]  I was curious, do seals attack?
[08:15.850 --> 08:17.670]  Seals can attack. Seals can be
[08:17.670 --> 08:19.210]  fucking vicious. And they're fast.
[08:19.710 --> 08:20.870]  You wouldn't mess with a seal.
[08:21.630 --> 08:23.610]  If I would fucking run so fast.
[08:23.750 --> 08:25.910]  And then I had this whole moment. I played out this whole scenario
[08:25.910 --> 08:27.790]  in my head. If I was in that fishing hole,
[08:27.930 --> 08:29.310]  I would have been killed by that seal.
[08:29.310 --> 08:31.110]  That seal would have destroyed me.
[08:31.210 --> 08:32.210]  I would have been eaten by that seal.
[08:33.030 --> 08:35.210]  So your version of
[08:35.210 --> 08:37.890]  Luke Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back
[08:37.890 --> 08:38.950]  in the Dagobah system,
[08:39.290 --> 08:41.310]  going through the swamp and confronting his
[08:41.310 --> 08:43.290]  darkest fear, which is himself as
[08:43.290 --> 08:45.330]  Darth Vader. Your version of that
[08:45.330 --> 08:46.950]  is a vacation to an aquarium
[08:46.950 --> 08:48.510]  in the Netherlands.
[08:49.090 --> 08:50.430]  It would be the end of me, yeah.
[08:50.550 --> 08:53.030]  I would run away, and I guess you're not supposed to.
[08:53.110 --> 08:54.650]  I guess seals like to chase things.
[08:55.010 --> 08:57.170]  So then I could just see the seal chasing after me.
[08:57.170 --> 08:58.570]  It was this whole thing.
[08:58.650 --> 09:01.130]  I went to the bathroom, and I googled seal teeth
[09:01.130 --> 09:02.390]  on my phone, and I just said,
[09:03.230 --> 09:05.130]  fuck that, when I found... I'll post this photo.
[09:05.910 --> 09:06.670]  I was looking, and I was like,
[09:06.790 --> 09:09.250]  fuck this! I'm fucking...
[09:09.250 --> 09:11.430]  I'm dead. I'm dead if I encounter a seal.
[09:11.910 --> 09:13.230]  They got bobbed teeth?
[09:13.630 --> 09:15.170]  Yeah, I don't want to fucking deal with that.
[09:15.350 --> 09:16.810]  Oh, lord. That sounds terrible.
[09:17.370 --> 09:19.390]  It's just gonna chase me. That's really cool.
[09:19.930 --> 09:21.250]  That looks like a recipe for a broken
[09:21.250 --> 09:22.930]  tooth. How do they hold on to that?
[09:23.630 --> 09:25.170]  Eric asked, how are they gonna chase me
[09:25.170 --> 09:27.310]  and land? They strike me as very slippery
[09:27.310 --> 09:29.230]  creatures. They got some movement
[09:29.230 --> 09:31.150]  to them. Like, you know, it's a fucking
[09:31.150 --> 09:33.370]  crocodile, alligator, whatever it is. They're faster
[09:33.370 --> 09:34.010]  than you'd think.
[09:35.050 --> 09:37.490]  Or a snake. You wouldn't think a snake
[09:37.490 --> 09:39.310]  could outrun me. I'd like to see a seal go down
[09:39.310 --> 09:40.710]  your slip and slide.
[09:41.190 --> 09:42.430]  Oh, my zim and glide?
[09:44.310 --> 09:45.130]  Zim and glide.
[09:45.230 --> 09:45.630]  Get the product.
[09:47.230 --> 09:49.190]  It's very different from a slip and slide.
[09:49.710 --> 09:50.130]  Zim and glide.
[09:51.650 --> 09:52.550]  I have a thing
[09:52.550 --> 09:54.410]  that I'd like to talk to you guys about.
[09:55.150 --> 09:55.550]  Okay.
[09:56.630 --> 09:58.750]  Real fast, before you do that, can I just say something?
[09:59.250 --> 09:59.550]  Sure.
[10:00.850 --> 10:02.310]  Are you supposed to say Happy New Year?
[10:02.870 --> 10:03.790]  Happy New Year!
[10:04.330 --> 10:06.330]  It's our first recording since the
[10:06.330 --> 10:07.850]  New Year, I believe. It is!
[10:07.990 --> 10:10.250]  It's almost like the latest we could possibly go.
[10:10.890 --> 10:12.490]  To have one. We're almost seven
[10:12.490 --> 10:12.970]  days in.
[10:15.210 --> 10:16.230]  What was I gonna say?
[10:16.610 --> 10:17.790]  I'm now on the rail.
[10:19.030 --> 10:20.170]  You have a thing.
[10:20.170 --> 10:21.230]  I have a thing!
[10:21.470 --> 10:24.310]  It happened New Year's Eve, the thing
[10:24.310 --> 10:25.010]  I'm gonna talk about.
[10:26.030 --> 10:27.250]  You watched Triple X?
[10:27.670 --> 10:30.190]  I wish! I should've watched
[10:30.190 --> 10:31.710]  all of them! There's three of them now!
[10:31.770 --> 10:33.090]  I could've done a whole night.
[10:33.830 --> 10:35.410]  It's a great trilogy, by the way.
[10:36.750 --> 10:38.170]  How do I want to set this up?
[10:38.190 --> 10:39.470]  I'm gonna post this email
[10:40.110 --> 10:42.310]  and then I'll have one of you
[10:42.310 --> 10:45.150]  read it. I'll have you read this.
[10:45.590 --> 10:46.490]  I woke up
[10:46.490 --> 10:47.390]  on Saturday morning
[10:47.390 --> 10:49.190]  and I had received this
[10:49.190 --> 10:51.470]  and it is maybe the most I feel
[10:51.470 --> 10:53.490]  I have f***ed myself in a long time.
[10:54.010 --> 10:54.490]  It's been a while.
[10:54.830 --> 10:57.530]  I'm gonna send this to you. Feel free to read it, Gavin.
[10:58.050 --> 10:58.890]  I'm reading that?
[10:59.450 --> 11:01.230]  Yeah, read the name of the person
[11:01.230 --> 11:02.430]  and read the text.
[11:03.070 --> 11:03.770]  And do it out loud.
[11:04.090 --> 11:07.070]  Okay, an email from New Year's Eve
[11:07.070 --> 11:08.390]  from Kevin Donovan
[11:08.390 --> 11:11.090]  to Andrew Penton. The email reads
[11:11.090 --> 11:12.870]  Sure, I'd be happy to.
[11:13.450 --> 11:15.150]  That's the director of the tuxedo.
[11:17.350 --> 11:18.310]  Oh, no!
[11:21.980 --> 11:22.540]  Oh!
[11:22.800 --> 11:24.620]  That was my reaction, Gavin.
[11:24.900 --> 11:26.320]  Oh, no!
[11:27.160 --> 11:28.140]  Oh, no!
[11:28.900 --> 11:30.200]  I woke up
[11:30.200 --> 11:32.320]  I woke up Saturday morning
[11:32.320 --> 11:35.120]  and looked at my phone and groggily said
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.660]  Oh, no!
[11:37.520 --> 11:39.340]  Sure, I'd be happy to.
[11:39.860 --> 11:41.140]  So, we have
[11:41.140 --> 11:43.020]  recorded, and I'm not sure if it'll be
[11:43.020 --> 11:44.960]  out at this time, but we did a commentary
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.960]  for the movie The Tuxedo
[11:46.960 --> 11:49.000]  because it's the movie that
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.080]  Gavin was most disappointed by
[11:51.080 --> 11:53.340]  from watching the trailer to seeing
[11:53.340 --> 11:54.900]  the final film.
[11:56.220 --> 11:56.680]  But if you
[11:56.680 --> 11:59.040]  knew that, and you thought, hey, I'll
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.340]  get the director involved.
[12:00.920 --> 12:02.440]  Well, this is...
[12:02.960 --> 12:05.220]  You signed me up for failure!
[12:05.520 --> 12:06.580]  No, we'll get to that.
[12:07.140 --> 12:08.880]  I reached out before
[12:08.880 --> 12:11.180]  and I didn't expect...
[12:11.180 --> 12:12.960]  See, I saw this. The way I wrote the email
[12:12.960 --> 12:14.800]  was like, hey,
[12:14.840 --> 12:17.120]  do you have any stories or anecdotes
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.020]  or anything that you could share? Because I thought it'd
[12:19.020 --> 12:21.120]  be funny if during the commentary
[12:21.120 --> 12:22.940]  track, I could be like, hey,
[12:22.960 --> 12:25.040]  I talked to the director. That's a weird
[12:25.040 --> 12:27.040]  random thing. This is something he had
[12:27.040 --> 12:28.140]  to say about it.
[12:29.580 --> 12:30.860]  That was my plan.
[12:31.100 --> 12:33.120]  We have since recorded that commentary.
[12:33.600 --> 12:34.880]  We're not kind
[12:34.880 --> 12:36.360]  in a lot of different ways.
[12:36.940 --> 12:38.540]  Absolutely nothing personal against the guy.
[12:38.980 --> 12:41.140]  Just, The Tuxedo's not a good movie.
[12:43.000 --> 12:43.700]  Doubling down?
[12:44.340 --> 12:45.260]  Well, I'm doubling down on that.
[12:45.360 --> 12:47.720]  It's not a good movie. I'm not saying it's his fault.
[12:47.780 --> 12:48.280]  I think that's subjective.
[12:48.980 --> 12:51.400]  I don't think it's his fault. I'm not saying he's at fault for it.
[12:51.700 --> 12:53.480]  But he's directed one film
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.820]  and it's The Tuxedo.
[12:55.100 --> 12:56.620]  I don't know his relationship.
[12:56.940 --> 12:59.500]  As far as I can tell, he's never talked about The Tuxedo.
[12:59.920 --> 13:00.620]  Post-Tuxedo.
[13:01.060 --> 13:03.080]  So I don't know what his feelings are on it
[13:03.080 --> 13:04.320]  overall as an experience.
[13:04.640 --> 13:07.600]  Making a good anything is really difficult.
[13:07.840 --> 13:09.240]  Yeah, what if he doesn't like it?
[13:09.240 --> 13:11.860]  Well, it could be like a Mike Judge
[13:11.860 --> 13:13.400]  idiocracy type thing
[13:13.400 --> 13:15.420]  where the studio got so
[13:15.420 --> 13:17.540]  or like Run Ronny Run where the studio got so
[13:17.540 --> 13:19.100]  involved. Like he had a brilliant
[13:19.100 --> 13:21.380]  Jackie Chan movie and then the studio
[13:21.380 --> 13:23.180]  got involved because he's a first time director
[13:23.180 --> 13:25.400]  and they fucking, they all like
[13:25.400 --> 13:27.400]  put their fingers in the pie and ended up muddying
[13:27.400 --> 13:27.960]  it all up.
[13:29.160 --> 13:31.500]  That's a possibility. I will say the one thing against that
[13:31.500 --> 13:32.900]  is I believe on his website
[13:32.900 --> 13:35.300]  he refers to The Tuxedo as
[13:35.300 --> 13:36.660]  a Kung Fu movie classic.
[13:37.220 --> 13:38.640]  Which would lead me to believe
[13:38.640 --> 13:40.580]  that he has favorable opinions
[13:40.580 --> 13:42.840]  about the film. When did the movie
[13:42.840 --> 13:44.680]  come out? 2002?
[13:45.600 --> 13:45.820]  Maybe?
[13:46.180 --> 13:48.760]  So 19 years ago and people are still
[13:48.760 --> 13:50.660]  making podcasts about it. That sounds like
[13:50.660 --> 13:51.600]  a classic to me, buddy.
[13:51.640 --> 13:52.680]  Sounds like a classic.
[13:55.280 --> 13:56.720]  What if we did a
[13:56.720 --> 13:58.680]  commentary with him on
[13:58.680 --> 13:59.380]  our commentary?
[14:00.540 --> 14:02.000]  We're doing a second...
[14:02.620 --> 14:04.660]  I gotta progress this story.
[14:04.660 --> 14:05.820]  So I look at this email
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.640]  and to me, I interpret this as he
[14:08.640 --> 14:10.520]  has interpreted my original email
[14:10.520 --> 14:12.620]  as saying that I want
[14:12.620 --> 14:14.740]  to interview him or talk to him
[14:14.740 --> 14:15.740]  more extensively.
[14:16.100 --> 14:18.420]  I thought this would go one of two ways.
[14:18.680 --> 14:20.220]  Either he wouldn't reply at all
[14:20.220 --> 14:22.440]  or he would reply and be like
[14:22.440 --> 14:24.380]  oh, when we did this, this happened.
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.600]  A little story about the movie. I never considered
[14:26.600 --> 14:28.540]  the possibility of it being
[14:28.540 --> 14:30.800]  interpreted as an interview, which I'd love to do.
[14:31.200 --> 14:32.420]  I would love to have an interview
[14:32.420 --> 14:34.100]  with Kevin Donovan and I was hoping that
[14:34.100 --> 14:36.320]  I could come in here today and be like
[14:36.320 --> 14:38.420]  I recorded an interview with the director of the
[14:38.420 --> 14:40.300]  Tuxedo and talk to you guys about that.
[14:40.720 --> 14:42.380]  I feel like we should be up front
[14:42.380 --> 14:44.520]  with him on how much we shout at his movie
[14:44.520 --> 14:46.320]  so he can be mean to us. That's the
[14:46.320 --> 14:48.500]  dilemma, Gavin! Because I want
[14:48.500 --> 14:50.540]  to be kind to Kevin. I have nothing against
[14:50.540 --> 14:52.620]  Kevin Donovan. I'm sure he's a great guy.
[14:53.400 --> 14:53.780]  But
[14:54.260 --> 14:56.460]  I would feel so disingenuous
[14:56.460 --> 14:57.340]  writing this.
[14:58.140 --> 14:59.320]  We'd have to be honest.
[14:59.940 --> 15:01.160]  Maintaining this very
[15:01.160 --> 15:03.340]  kind tone, which I have on a human
[15:03.340 --> 15:04.620]  level for Kevin Donovan.
[15:05.260 --> 15:07.520]  But, at the same time, I feel
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.200]  like such a dickhead being like
[15:09.200 --> 15:11.040]  hey, nice to meet you, thanks for replying.
[15:11.380 --> 15:13.320]  We thought your movie fucking sucked.
[15:13.440 --> 15:14.340]  It was terrible.
[15:15.220 --> 15:17.260]  But I'd love to talk more with you.
[15:17.720 --> 15:18.960]  Please, that'd be great.
[15:20.700 --> 15:21.320]  Like, what
[15:21.320 --> 15:23.360]  do I do? I felt so
[15:23.360 --> 15:24.020]  f*** faced.
[15:24.440 --> 15:27.240]  You f*** faced yourself. There's no good way out of this.
[15:27.240 --> 15:28.920]  There's zero good way out of it.
[15:29.220 --> 15:31.180]  The upside, the only saving grace
[15:31.180 --> 15:33.260]  is that we had a great time watching it.
[15:33.340 --> 15:35.420]  And maybe he'll be happy with that. But we did shit on it.
[15:35.980 --> 15:36.760]  We shit on that movie.
[15:37.140 --> 15:38.640]  A lot. It was a lot.
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.280]  I do like the idea of doing
[15:41.280 --> 15:42.280]  a director's commentary
[15:43.300 --> 15:44.580]  on our commentary.
[15:45.720 --> 15:47.260]  Like, I like the idea
[15:47.260 --> 15:49.200]  of getting him involved and having him do
[15:49.200 --> 15:51.300]  what... I wonder what the most
[15:51.300 --> 15:53.260]  nested series
[15:53.260 --> 15:55.120]  of commentaries over a property is.
[15:55.120 --> 15:56.800]  Like, what if we just did a commentary
[15:58.640 --> 15:59.520]  over our
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.060]  Tuxedo commentary. And then, like, every
[16:01.060 --> 16:03.360]  two months, we just do another commentary on top of that.
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.280]  I think it's really funny if we
[16:05.280 --> 16:07.160]  just go forever. If we have
[16:07.160 --> 16:09.140]  a more extensive bonus features
[16:09.140 --> 16:11.140]  section for the Tuxedo than the release of
[16:11.140 --> 16:13.100]  the Tuxedo had. Like, what we're offering
[16:13.100 --> 16:15.180]  is better than the DVD final package.
[16:16.020 --> 16:17.000]  What was in the DVD
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.300]  bonus stuff, Gav? Because you were a big
[16:19.300 --> 16:21.240]  fan of director's commentaries and bonus features
[16:21.240 --> 16:22.800]  and stuff. Yeah.
[16:23.320 --> 16:24.760]  Was it during the time
[16:24.760 --> 16:26.440]  where they were, like, interactive menu?
[16:28.800 --> 16:30.780]  Do you remember that? Like, when DVDs were coming
[16:30.780 --> 16:32.820]  out, they put that as a feature. Interactive
[16:32.820 --> 16:34.700]  menu. You could click
[16:34.700 --> 16:37.060]  stuff. Like, that was like a big...
[16:37.060 --> 16:38.680]  Some DVD menus
[16:38.680 --> 16:40.500]  would go all out. They would.
[16:40.520 --> 16:42.660]  They would put so much up. And some would just be, like, text
[16:42.660 --> 16:44.540]  on a plain background. I have
[16:44.540 --> 16:46.540]  never cared about a DVD menu.
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.560]  We used to go out of our mind
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.640]  when we would make those red versus blue DVDs.
[16:50.640 --> 16:52.540]  They were cloth. Piling on extra
[16:52.540 --> 16:54.460]  features and easter eggs.
[16:54.560 --> 16:56.700]  We would have, like, 40 or 50
[16:56.700 --> 16:58.600]  easter eggs per DVD. Just tons
[16:58.600 --> 17:00.740]  of shit. Yeah, you'd go to, like, chapter
[17:00.740 --> 17:02.740]  select and then, like, chapter 5 to 8
[17:02.740 --> 17:04.600]  and then press down and it would, like, take you
[17:04.600 --> 17:06.520]  to a secret. It's cool stuff like that.
[17:07.140 --> 17:08.000]  There are some cool things.
[17:08.920 --> 17:10.500]  That is cool. That is awesome.
[17:10.540 --> 17:12.560]  I don't like the ones where, like, it would be a
[17:12.560 --> 17:14.420]  sequence and then they'd loop you back.
[17:14.740 --> 17:16.640]  Like, your menu would freeze for a second and then
[17:16.640 --> 17:17.720]  it would restart the sequence.
[17:17.720 --> 17:19.660]  I don't want a freezing menu.
[17:19.920 --> 17:21.060]  Right. I think
[17:21.720 --> 17:23.020]  for a first-time director
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.380]  who was working with
[17:25.380 --> 17:27.520]  a lot of money and some of the biggest
[17:27.520 --> 17:29.320]  stars in the world at the time
[17:29.960 --> 17:31.740]  and he pulled it off
[17:31.740 --> 17:33.040]  and I'm just
[17:33.640 --> 17:35.700]  disappointed in how hateful you both are
[17:35.700 --> 17:37.480]  towards this film.
[17:38.460 --> 17:39.520]  I don't remember expressing
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.520]  any discontent with at all.
[17:43.580 --> 17:44.180]  I count
[17:44.180 --> 17:45.880]  myself a fan of Kevin Donovan.
[17:45.880 --> 17:48.360]  I bet you 10 grand you didn't.
[17:49.900 --> 17:51.720]  That's the other concern with this
[17:51.720 --> 17:53.860]  is I don't remember specifically what
[17:53.860 --> 17:55.480]  we said in the commentary track.
[17:55.600 --> 17:57.680]  I can't... I don't know what I'm
[17:57.680 --> 18:00.280]  defending fully. I just know there's a lot of it.
[18:00.620 --> 18:01.680]  I don't remember exactly
[18:01.680 --> 18:03.860]  what we said. I just know we were
[18:03.860 --> 18:05.840]  treating it very much like the director wasn't
[18:05.840 --> 18:07.780]  listening to us. Yes. And never
[18:07.780 --> 18:09.500]  would. Absolutely not.
[18:09.640 --> 18:11.820]  We would contact him and make
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.760]  ourselves known to him as we were
[18:13.760 --> 18:14.200]  doing it.
[18:16.040 --> 18:17.500]  So that was my dilemma.
[18:17.680 --> 18:19.520]  I woke up Saturday both excited that
[18:19.520 --> 18:21.960]  holy fuck I can't believe Kevin Donovan actually replied.
[18:22.620 --> 18:23.420]  How do I
[18:23.420 --> 18:25.660]  reply to this? And I had the same
[18:25.660 --> 18:27.460]  dilemma as Gavin brought up of like
[18:28.100 --> 18:29.920]  I feel like if I'm just super
[18:29.920 --> 18:31.840]  nice I can immediately get this done
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.820]  but that feels super wrong and disingenuous
[18:34.300 --> 18:35.840]  and I need to... how do I approach
[18:35.840 --> 18:37.580]  how do you tell someone that the thing
[18:37.580 --> 18:39.860]  the one movie they made you thought was really bad.
[18:40.640 --> 18:41.780]  This might be one of the rare scenarios
[18:41.780 --> 18:43.760]  where being nice is the meanest you
[18:43.760 --> 18:45.840]  could be. That's a great way
[18:45.840 --> 18:47.040]  of looking at it.
[18:47.920 --> 18:49.680]  So I replied. I will
[18:49.680 --> 18:50.900]  oh god.
[18:51.520 --> 18:53.400]  I wrote back on Monday
[18:53.400 --> 18:55.540]  and then I had this realization
[18:55.540 --> 18:57.700]  because it took a few days obviously there was some time
[18:57.700 --> 18:59.320]  period between when I sent it and when it arrived.
[18:59.820 --> 19:01.860]  I had the realization that it is so
[19:01.860 --> 19:03.200]  classically us
[19:03.660 --> 19:05.800]  that in the original email I didn't really
[19:05.800 --> 19:07.520]  say anything about what our show was
[19:07.520 --> 19:10.060]  or what kind of the tone of it is
[19:10.060 --> 19:12.100]  just that we were doing a thing
[19:12.100 --> 19:13.540]  with the tuxedo. I'd love to
[19:13.860 --> 19:15.660]  Did you tell them the name? No.
[19:16.040 --> 19:17.360]  I don't think I did in the first email.
[19:18.380 --> 19:19.960]  Well, without a direct link
[19:19.960 --> 19:21.940]  our podcast is impossible to find so we're probably
[19:21.940 --> 19:24.020]  safe. Yeah well I sent that
[19:24.020 --> 19:26.080]  in the second email. I provided a direct
[19:26.080 --> 19:27.920]  link. Damn it.
[19:28.300 --> 19:28.680]  Andrew!
[19:29.540 --> 19:31.820]  I provided a direct link
[19:31.820 --> 19:33.320]  and then I had the realization
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.920]  that by the time he probably
[19:35.920 --> 19:37.700]  gets around to looking at that email
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.440]  if he were to decide like
[19:39.440 --> 19:40.860]  I'm gonna give this show a chance
[19:40.860 --> 19:43.620]  the episode he would listen to is
[19:43.620 --> 19:45.580]  the most broken and chaotic
[19:45.580 --> 19:47.940]  episode. Think about the one that came out on Wednesday
[19:47.940 --> 19:49.680]  this past Wednesday. The one where I
[19:49.680 --> 19:51.620]  tried to print the law and everything
[19:51.620 --> 19:53.480]  broke down. That will be his
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.920]  introduction to this show.
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.280]  Well, apparently
[19:57.280 --> 19:59.420]  according to almost every comment
[19:59.420 --> 20:01.660]  I saw on that episode it's the best
[20:01.660 --> 20:02.680]  one we've ever done.
[20:03.020 --> 20:04.600]  So maybe we're lucky.
[20:04.600 --> 20:06.760]  People fucking love that.
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.640]  Oh my lord. I thought it was a
[20:08.640 --> 20:10.520]  train wreck. I like that we came away
[20:10.520 --> 20:12.660]  from that thinking we had 18 minutes
[20:12.660 --> 20:13.800]  of Andrew's audio.
[20:16.700 --> 20:18.680]  Nick, how many minutes did we actually
[20:18.680 --> 20:18.940]  have?
[20:20.260 --> 20:22.380]  We had most of the backup
[20:22.380 --> 20:24.600]  but zero of the
[20:24.600 --> 20:25.720]  raw recording. Right.
[20:26.120 --> 20:28.360]  So, okay.
[20:28.980 --> 20:30.400]  Thank you for bringing that up. Pivot
[20:30.400 --> 20:32.460]  away from Kevin Donovan for a moment.
[20:32.460 --> 20:34.200]  I meant to mention this. I forgot I did.
[20:34.440 --> 20:36.320]  There was a point in time in which I was
[20:36.320 --> 20:38.540]  back in and I could hear you
[20:38.540 --> 20:40.560]  guys talking but I couldn't talk at all
[20:40.560 --> 20:42.560]  but I could hear everything you all were saying.
[20:43.200 --> 20:44.540]  And I felt like there was a point
[20:44.540 --> 20:46.380]  in which Gavin was snitching on me for
[20:46.380 --> 20:48.320]  pausing my recording the previous week
[20:48.320 --> 20:50.100]  in a panic and then turning it back on.
[20:50.500 --> 20:52.400]  Yeah, I heard that. Or I caught the tail
[20:52.400 --> 20:54.400]  end of that. And then, Gavin, you
[20:54.400 --> 20:56.360]  made a point where you were like
[20:56.360 --> 20:58.400]  why didn't we just pause for like
[20:58.400 --> 21:00.620]  three minutes? Have Andrew reboot his computer
[21:00.620 --> 21:02.620]  and then just get on so this would be
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.640]  fine. It takes like 20 minutes for my
[21:04.640 --> 21:06.420]  computer to reboot but I was so
[21:06.420 --> 21:08.400]  annoyed with you. I was like
[21:08.400 --> 21:10.480]  fucking, you don't think I'd fucking, okay I'm gonna
[21:10.480 --> 21:12.480]  fucking reset it and I'll reply
[21:12.480 --> 21:14.220]  in an hour when it turns back on.
[21:14.340 --> 21:16.520]  So I start holding down the power button
[21:16.520 --> 21:18.500]  on my computer while everything's fucking
[21:18.500 --> 21:20.100]  broken. And then I remembered
[21:20.590 --> 21:22.440]  I haven't saved, we did two
[21:22.440 --> 21:24.620]  episodes, that was the second one. I did
[21:24.620 --> 21:26.200]  not save the recording
[21:26.200 --> 21:28.660]  for my first one. Cause it takes like
[21:28.660 --> 21:30.540]  10 minutes to save
[21:30.540 --> 21:32.840]  and we're going back to back. So I'm
[21:32.840 --> 21:34.680]  holding the power button and then I
[21:34.680 --> 21:36.620]  realized that I haven't saved my
[21:36.620 --> 21:38.760]  first recording. I'm gonna lose it
[21:38.760 --> 21:40.740]  if I turn my machine off. So then I
[21:40.740 --> 21:42.780]  let go of the power button and I spent
[21:42.780 --> 21:44.900]  the next 15 minutes frantically
[21:44.900 --> 21:46.740]  trying to save before the
[21:46.740 --> 21:48.700]  chain of events realized that it was supposed
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.660]  to turn my computer off. And I was
[21:50.660 --> 21:52.840]  just a frantic mess behind the scenes
[21:52.840 --> 21:54.660]  trying to just make sure I didn't lose
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.820]  literally all my audio. I'd given
[21:56.820 --> 21:58.720]  up on that recording being useful
[21:58.720 --> 22:00.820]  but I also almost punted
[22:00.820 --> 22:03.040]  away the perfectly fine recording
[22:03.040 --> 22:04.480]  for the first one we did on that day.
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.060]  Wait. Oh Andrew.
[22:06.880 --> 22:08.760]  What Gavin? Oh yeah, I just really want Nick
[22:08.760 --> 22:09.900]  to understand what he's saying.
[22:10.640 --> 22:12.600]  Oh he's, yeah, Nick was terrifying.
[22:12.760 --> 22:14.480]  My heart was beating fast too Nick.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.780]  Well if your computer wasn't choking on the
[22:16.780 --> 22:18.560]  law, I assume it would've rebooted
[22:18.560 --> 22:21.060]  a lot sooner. Oh it would've died so quickly.
[22:21.460 --> 22:22.940]  Yeah. Saved by
[22:22.940 --> 22:24.240]  the law. It was.
[22:24.240 --> 22:25.720]  I was saved by the law.
[22:25.980 --> 22:27.500]  Here's what I'll say about Kevin Donovan.
[22:29.120 --> 22:30.260]  I don't know how
[22:30.260 --> 22:32.060]  this is gonna end. I assume you're not done
[22:32.060 --> 22:34.260]  Andrew with the story and that it'll probably go
[22:34.260 --> 22:36.020]  somewhere. But I will say
[22:36.020 --> 22:38.100]  and I had a light bulb moment just now
[22:38.940 --> 22:40.300]  if things don't go well
[22:40.300 --> 22:41.120]  with Kevin Donovan
[22:41.860 --> 22:43.960]  what we will have
[22:43.960 --> 22:46.320]  is our first enemy of f*** face.
[22:46.840 --> 22:48.340]  No! I don't want to be enemies
[22:48.340 --> 22:50.380]  with Kevin Donovan. I don't either
[22:50.380 --> 22:52.080]  but he might want to be enemies with you
[22:52.080 --> 22:53.880]  and there's nothing I can do about that
[22:53.880 --> 22:56.260]  and if he's an enemy with you then he's an enemy of us
[22:56.260 --> 22:58.140]  because we're a team, right? So I'm just saying
[22:58.140 --> 23:00.020]  there could be like a f***
[23:00.020 --> 23:01.780]  f*** face list of
[23:01.780 --> 23:04.100]  f*** faced haters and he might just be number
[23:04.100 --> 23:05.860]  one on it. Think of like this... No.
[23:06.560 --> 23:07.380]  No, we're not.
[23:07.880 --> 23:10.080]  It's bound to happen at some point.
[23:10.120 --> 23:11.200]  Right? I know
[23:12.420 --> 23:13.960]  you've already run afoul
[23:13.960 --> 23:16.160]  of the legal lawyer people
[23:16.160 --> 23:18.180]  by continuing to hide on their
[23:18.180 --> 23:19.840]  system for a long time. I still get emails
[23:19.840 --> 23:20.320]  occasionally.
[23:21.600 --> 23:23.940]  I don't count them as friends of the podcast
[23:23.940 --> 23:25.320]  Oh, I think they're friends.
[23:26.300 --> 23:28.040]  I'm involved. I'm there.
[23:28.300 --> 23:28.660]  I'm in there.
[23:29.540 --> 23:31.500]  Are you talking about the lawyers or the judges?
[23:31.880 --> 23:32.440]  The judges.
[23:33.160 --> 23:35.580]  Yeah, I still get emails from
[23:35.580 --> 23:37.720]  hirejudge.com. What is a judge
[23:37.720 --> 23:39.580]  Gavin, but a lawyer who got a promotion?
[23:42.100 --> 23:43.640]  Because I think we're enemies with both.
[23:43.700 --> 23:45.240]  I think we're also enemies with two dips***
[23:52.140 --> 23:52.580]  Um...
[23:52.580 --> 23:53.460]  So I replied
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.880]  to Kevin Donovan, and I
[23:55.880 --> 23:57.840]  wrote, like, the first section of it
[23:57.840 --> 23:59.940]  was very sweet. And I'm not going to read
[23:59.940 --> 24:01.600]  the email, but it was very much like
[24:01.600 --> 24:03.900]  it's so nice to hear from you. Thank
[24:03.900 --> 24:05.520]  you so much for getting back to us.
[24:05.960 --> 24:07.920]  And then the second part
[24:09.280 --> 24:10.260]  is the pivot
[24:10.260 --> 24:11.880]  of I just want
[24:11.880 --> 24:13.800]  to be upfront with you, because I would feel
[24:13.800 --> 24:15.780]  wrong doing so otherwise. We
[24:15.780 --> 24:17.700]  made fun of the tuxedo
[24:17.700 --> 24:19.780]  quite a bit. We made a lot of jokes.
[24:19.880 --> 24:21.120]  I said something like that along the lines.
[24:21.640 --> 24:23.720]  This is where I probably made another mistake.
[24:27.540 --> 24:29.640]  I was very polite.
[24:29.960 --> 24:31.860]  I feel like I wrote as kind
[24:31.860 --> 24:33.860]  of like a, hey, we shit on this thing
[24:33.860 --> 24:35.660]  that you worked on, as I could.
[24:35.940 --> 24:37.920]  I felt like I needed to
[24:38.960 --> 24:39.760]  show that
[24:39.760 --> 24:41.420]  I was... I don't know.
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.820]  This is weird. I had to put something on the
[24:43.820 --> 24:45.440]  line. I had to put stakes on the line.
[24:45.440 --> 24:47.740]  So I was like, if you have any questions,
[24:48.420 --> 24:49.460]  feel free to
[24:49.460 --> 24:51.520]  email me back here, or
[24:51.520 --> 24:53.360]  you can text me at this
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.240]  number. And I gave him... Kevin Donovan
[24:55.240 --> 24:56.760]  has my personal cell phone number.
[24:57.200 --> 24:58.800]  So he can just text me
[24:59.440 --> 25:00.260]  at any point.
[25:01.080 --> 25:03.260]  You have so many different phone numbers.
[25:03.340 --> 25:05.160]  Why did you give him your real personal one?
[25:05.280 --> 25:07.060]  Because I don't know.
[25:07.100 --> 25:09.280]  It just seemed like I wanted to be
[25:09.280 --> 25:11.360]  like, listen, I'm coming from a genuine
[25:11.360 --> 25:13.200]  place. This feels so much...
[25:13.200 --> 25:14.920]  If I was in his position, I think it would feel
[25:14.920 --> 25:15.580]  like a trap.
[25:17.200 --> 25:18.780]  Surely you wouldn't even bother.
[25:19.360 --> 25:21.220]  Someone says, hey, we shit on your movie.
[25:21.360 --> 25:22.660]  Feel free to text me.
[25:22.920 --> 25:25.100]  It's a helpline. What are you expecting
[25:25.100 --> 25:25.580]  him to do?
[25:27.320 --> 25:28.880]  That is a personal
[25:28.880 --> 25:31.000]  thing that could go wrong. I felt like
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.960]  I was wagering something at that point.
[25:33.080 --> 25:35.040]  I was putting something of
[25:35.040 --> 25:36.620]  value on the thing.
[25:36.980 --> 25:38.100]  You were giving something back.
[25:38.380 --> 25:40.860]  You shit on his movie. Here's my phone number.
[25:40.860 --> 25:42.880]  I chat on
[25:42.880 --> 25:44.520]  your movie and
[25:44.520 --> 25:46.880]  I want to be friends with you to the point where
[25:46.880 --> 25:48.960]  I'm letting you have personal direct access
[25:48.960 --> 25:50.220]  to me whenever you want.
[25:51.280 --> 25:53.040]  We shouldn't let you talk to people.
[25:53.320 --> 25:54.820]  No, I'm great at talking
[25:54.820 --> 25:55.380]  with people.
[25:55.520 --> 25:58.280]  I'm talking to Kevin Donovan.
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.860]  It was a timing issue. It wasn't a talking
[26:00.860 --> 26:01.560]  to people issue.
[26:03.160 --> 26:04.700]  If I'm Kevin Donovan,
[26:05.020 --> 26:06.640]  I start a new podcast called
[26:06.640 --> 26:08.820]  Fuxedo and I just shit on
[26:08.820 --> 26:10.900]  our podcast for an hour
[26:10.900 --> 26:12.380]  every week. That'd be really funny.
[26:13.160 --> 26:14.240]  I'd actually like that a lot.
[26:16.240 --> 26:16.880]  You're acting
[26:16.880 --> 26:18.940]  like, oh no, look what's happened. It's unfortunate.
[26:19.180 --> 26:20.940]  You still reached out to him in the first
[26:20.940 --> 26:22.800]  place knowing that we didn't
[26:22.800 --> 26:24.860]  like his movie. No, I did it before
[26:25.920 --> 26:26.780]  I did it before
[26:26.780 --> 26:28.940]  we recorded it. Before what? Before we recorded
[26:28.940 --> 26:30.720]  it. Yeah, but we already didn't like
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.600]  the movie. But you knew you didn't like it.
[26:32.680 --> 26:34.580]  It's like, hey, Cosmic Crisp, we love your
[26:34.580 --> 26:36.740]  apples. I want to talk to you. Hey, Kevin
[26:36.740 --> 26:38.840]  Donovan, your movie stinks. I want to talk
[26:38.840 --> 26:40.620]  to you. I have more anger with Cosmic Crisp
[26:40.620 --> 26:41.740]  than Tuxedo, but
[26:42.700 --> 26:44.560]  the Tuxedo, I was open to liking.
[26:45.200 --> 26:46.740]  I remember watching it as a kid and
[26:46.740 --> 26:48.720]  not being the biggest fan of it, but I went in
[26:48.720 --> 26:51.060]  hopeful that I would have a better experience
[26:51.060 --> 26:52.820]  and I'd have a great time. It came up in conversation
[26:52.820 --> 26:54.800]  because I named it as my
[26:54.800 --> 26:56.740]  most disappointed I've ever been
[26:56.740 --> 26:58.720]  watching a film. Yeah, but I don't always, I don't agree with every
[26:58.720 --> 27:00.620]  fucking opinion Gavin Free has.
[27:00.880 --> 27:02.540]  Why am I? I'm not saying my opinion is
[27:02.540 --> 27:04.840]  more valid or important. I'm just saying
[27:04.840 --> 27:06.880]  that's how it came up. That's not
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.900]  the reason to reach out to the people
[27:08.900 --> 27:10.600]  who made it. Yeah, but you have
[27:10.600 --> 27:12.780]  ridiculous opinions about the new Matrix movie
[27:12.780 --> 27:14.820]  too, so I don't know how to evaluate your movie text.
[27:15.380 --> 27:16.140]  Could be wrong.
[27:16.800 --> 27:17.940]  You don't know. Oh, man.
[27:19.060 --> 27:20.780]  So, did Kevin call
[27:20.780 --> 27:22.820]  or text you? I have not heard
[27:22.820 --> 27:24.940]  back from Kevin Donovan since I replied
[27:24.940 --> 27:26.520]  with my phone number and
[27:26.520 --> 27:28.680]  that episode has released.
[27:28.860 --> 27:30.840]  You sound like a fucking stalker. That's probably
[27:30.840 --> 27:32.800]  why. Yeah, he should run a mile. It's like, hey, Kevin, let's hang out.
[27:32.800 --> 27:34.440]  Here's my number. Give me a call if you want to.
[27:34.860 --> 27:36.680]  Where do you live, by the way? What's your address? Would you mind
[27:36.680 --> 27:38.580]  if I came and visited you? What do you like for lunch?
[27:38.600 --> 27:40.200]  I'll bring sandwiches. No.
[27:40.640 --> 27:42.240]  It was a nicely written email.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.340]  I think, I don't know.
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.700]  I would be surprised if we hear
[27:46.700 --> 27:48.640]  back, but I'm hopeful. I have questions
[27:48.640 --> 27:50.600]  for, like, I genuinely have questions about
[27:50.600 --> 27:52.640]  that movie. I want to know why James
[27:52.640 --> 27:54.700]  Brown is in it. I want to know if there's a list
[27:54.700 --> 27:56.880]  of suit functions that they didn't cover.
[27:57.100 --> 27:58.580]  Are there any edited suit scenes?
[27:58.920 --> 28:00.660]  What is it like working with Jackie
[28:00.660 --> 28:02.540]  Chan? Because, like, he openly hates
[28:02.540 --> 28:04.800]  all of his American movies. That must be a weird
[28:04.800 --> 28:06.840]  thing. I would want to know
[28:06.840 --> 28:08.700]  because these things always happen on film sets,
[28:08.740 --> 28:10.720]  right? You work intensely together for months and
[28:10.720 --> 28:12.820]  months and months. I wonder, like,
[28:12.860 --> 28:14.200]  what lifelong friendships
[28:15.020 --> 28:16.720]  he built in the process of
[28:16.720 --> 28:18.660]  making that film. Like, are he and Jackie Chan's
[28:18.660 --> 28:20.700]  are he and Jackie Chan's close and they still
[28:20.700 --> 28:22.520]  send each other Christmas cards, you know? Yeah, does he have
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.680]  Jackie Chan's phone number? It's funny you mention
[28:24.680 --> 28:26.640]  that. He filmed a commercial with Jackie
[28:26.640 --> 28:28.140]  Chan in, like, 2018,
[28:28.140 --> 28:29.880]  I want to say. Maybe a bit earlier.
[28:30.320 --> 28:31.980]  He has done, like, he
[28:31.980 --> 28:34.020]  didn't stop there. There
[28:34.020 --> 28:36.320]  could be a deeper connection. Do you think Jackie Chan
[28:36.320 --> 28:38.320]  remembered him? Oh, yeah.
[28:39.080 --> 28:39.560]  Yeah, I do.
[28:40.800 --> 28:41.680]  Kevin Donovan,
[28:42.320 --> 28:44.140]  I hope I get a reply
[28:44.140 --> 28:45.960]  back. I'd love to hear from Kevin Donovan.
[28:46.600 --> 28:48.120]  What questions, do you guys have any questions
[28:48.120 --> 28:50.100]  you would like to ask? Ask Kevin
[28:50.100 --> 28:52.200]  Donovan? Yeah. What did you
[28:52.200 --> 28:54.200]  think when you heard, when you received
[28:54.200 --> 28:55.720]  this initial email
[28:56.820 --> 28:57.700]  or contact
[28:57.700 --> 28:59.760]  from Andrew, and what do you think now?
[29:00.260 --> 29:01.840]  You guys are going to do your own Kevin Donovan
[29:01.840 --> 29:03.640]  interview about his interaction
[29:03.640 --> 29:05.780]  with me. Are you, Eric said, are you
[29:05.780 --> 29:06.400]  mad at us?
[29:09.080 --> 29:09.720]  Here's my
[29:10.280 --> 29:11.420]  question for Kevin Donovan.
[29:11.740 --> 29:13.300]  Will you accept my apology?
[29:17.660 --> 29:19.640]  I was very excited about that.
[29:19.820 --> 29:21.860]  I was excited to bring that to the show. I wish
[29:21.860 --> 29:23.680]  that, in my head,
[29:23.680 --> 29:25.500]  it would have been really funny if I had an interview
[29:25.500 --> 29:27.700]  with Kevin Donovan as well, but I just
[29:27.700 --> 29:29.860]  hope he doesn't hate us, is where I currently stand
[29:29.860 --> 29:31.740]  with Kevin Donovan. I'm just, I'm glad
[29:31.740 --> 29:33.640]  you're honest with him. Well, I kind of wish you'd never
[29:34.180 --> 29:35.680]  talk to him in the first place, if I'm being
[29:35.680 --> 29:36.960]  truly honest, but... Why?
[29:38.880 --> 29:39.520]  Why? Why?
[29:40.020 --> 29:41.660]  What do you mean, why? Why?
[29:41.800 --> 29:43.680]  Because now we have a hate list, and he's at
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.780]  the top of it, and now we have a competitive podcast
[29:45.780 --> 29:47.500]  on the way out called the Fluxedo
[29:47.500 --> 29:49.660]  that's just going to shit on us all day long.
[29:50.480 --> 29:50.840]  I
[29:52.740 --> 29:53.780]  would genuinely love
[29:53.780 --> 29:55.580]  to have a talk with Kevin Donovan. I
[29:55.580 --> 29:57.840]  am more, as I said, I'm more upset with Cosmic
[29:57.840 --> 29:59.460]  Crisp than I am Kevin Donovan
[29:59.460 --> 30:01.740]  and Tuxedo. I think they're a bigger rival to
[30:01.740 --> 30:04.100]  us. I don't know...
[30:04.100 --> 30:05.680]  I don't know what that means. Why are you
[30:05.680 --> 30:07.240]  upset with Cosmic Crisp, who, by the way,
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.340]  can cut us in on their Apple profits,
[30:09.620 --> 30:11.660]  because we have sold so many fucking apples for those
[30:11.660 --> 30:13.840]  people. Not only that, Geoff, that's why.
[30:14.020 --> 30:15.540]  That's why I'm getting into it. I've been sent
[30:15.540 --> 30:17.700]  screenshots of fucking Cosmic Crisp
[30:17.700 --> 30:19.280]  promoting YouTube content.
[30:19.660 --> 30:21.500]  They're out there promoting content.
[30:22.160 --> 30:23.840]  And they haven't worked with us.
[30:24.140 --> 30:25.660]  Yeah, I mean, it's weird that you
[30:25.660 --> 30:27.840]  wouldn't see a tweet from Cosmic Crisp
[30:27.840 --> 30:29.840]  the Apple company saying, hey, check
[30:29.840 --> 30:30.800]  out f***face.
[30:31.440 --> 30:33.800]  Yeah, what's more synonymous with apples than
[30:33.800 --> 30:35.680]  f***face? We are an
[30:35.680 --> 30:37.620]  Apple podcast. I get you're making a joke
[30:37.620 --> 30:38.620]  there, Gavin, but we have
[30:39.420 --> 30:41.880]  done more for the Cosmic Crisp
[30:41.880 --> 30:43.720]  than maybe everybody outside of those
[30:43.720 --> 30:44.940]  who invented it.
[30:44.940 --> 30:46.900]  Yeah, it's fine, but no one's ever going
[30:46.900 --> 30:48.460]  to talk to us because of our stupid name.
[30:49.160 --> 30:50.180]  We f***faced ourselves.
[30:51.840 --> 30:52.880]  When you talk
[30:52.880 --> 30:55.020]  to people, maybe, well, I'm sure I haven't.
[30:55.220 --> 30:56.860]  When you talk to people that don't know about
[30:56.860 --> 30:58.900]  the podcast and you're trying to
[30:58.900 --> 31:00.700]  bring them into the world, how do you describe,
[31:00.960 --> 31:02.800]  do you immediately feel the need to describe
[31:02.800 --> 31:04.180]  what the name references?
[31:05.180 --> 31:06.960]  I don't think I've ever told anyone about this podcast.
[31:10.240 --> 31:11.380]  I don't think I have either.
[31:11.920 --> 31:12.320]  I don't think I have either.
[31:12.320 --> 31:12.620]  Every time,
[31:12.620 --> 31:14.800]  as soon as I'm like, the show is called
[31:14.800 --> 31:16.400]  F***face, then I'll always add,
[31:16.540 --> 31:18.380]  it's a reference to a baseball card air.
[31:18.880 --> 31:20.600]  I immediately go into
[31:20.600 --> 31:22.360]  like, you have to clarify.
[31:23.080 --> 31:23.700]  It's a great name.
[31:25.300 --> 31:26.500]  I've even had to do
[31:27.620 --> 31:28.780]  little interview bits
[31:28.780 --> 31:30.540]  and stuff with our marketing department
[31:30.540 --> 31:32.620]  about like, hey, we need a soundbite
[31:32.620 --> 31:34.640]  or we need a little two-paragraph thing about what
[31:34.640 --> 31:36.740]  f***face is about and stuff. I don't even like doing that.
[31:36.860 --> 31:38.560]  I'm just like, it's just a podcast about nothing.
[31:38.760 --> 31:40.440]  I don't know how to explain it.
[31:41.080 --> 31:41.900]  There's no way
[31:42.520 --> 31:44.040]  to do it without having to start
[31:45.140 --> 31:46.540]  unraveling a f***ing ball of
[31:46.540 --> 31:47.880]  string that never ends.
[31:48.080 --> 31:50.400]  So I just, I prefer not to.
[31:50.480 --> 31:52.400]  I just say, you know what? Don't listen to it.
[31:52.460 --> 31:53.020]  It's not a big deal.
[31:55.040 --> 31:56.140]  Yeah, I would say it's like
[31:56.140 --> 31:57.900]  deep lore about nothing.
[32:01.280 --> 32:02.340]  Deep lore about
[32:02.340 --> 32:04.280]  nothing. Nick said, whenever my parents ask me
[32:04.280 --> 32:06.020]  at work, I refer to it as bleepface
[32:06.020 --> 32:07.660]  since they get weirded out when I say f***.
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.080]  I go with f***face.
[32:10.480 --> 32:11.900]  Bleepface is a good idea though.
[32:12.180 --> 32:13.280]  Deep lore about
[32:13.280 --> 32:14.780]  nothing. I like that.
[32:15.040 --> 32:17.240]  That is good. Yeah, that's poetic, Kevin.
[32:17.480 --> 32:19.060]  Who wrote that for you? Was that Meg?
[32:20.140 --> 32:21.040]  Oh, yeah.
[32:21.180 --> 32:22.080]  She wrote that for me.

[33:58.840 --> 34:00.960]  There's a holistic solution for men that
[34:00.960 --> 34:03.180]  promotes both healthier hair and whole body
[34:03.180 --> 34:04.880]  wellness without drugs or
[34:04.880 --> 34:06.820]  prescriptions. Did you know that there are
[34:06.820 --> 34:08.880]  5 root causes of thinning hair? I
[34:08.880 --> 34:10.880]  did not. I'm learning this as I say it. Nutrafol
[34:10.880 --> 34:13.040]  is the hair supplement that goes beyond
[34:13.040 --> 34:14.620]  genetics to target stress,
[34:14.980 --> 34:17.300]  hormones, nutrition, metabolism,
[34:17.740 --> 34:18.920]  and environmental factors
[34:18.920 --> 34:20.960]  that may be impacting your hair. That makes
[34:20.960 --> 34:22.880]  sense. I suffer from all of those
[34:22.880 --> 34:24.820]  factors. Nutrafol is clinically
[34:24.820 --> 34:26.900]  shown to improve hair growth, thickness,
[34:27.180 --> 34:29.300]  and visible scalp coverage without compromise.
[34:29.660 --> 34:31.080]  21 potent natural
[34:31.080 --> 34:32.760]  ingredients support sex drive,
[34:32.760 --> 34:34.820]  better sleep, and less stress
[34:34.820 --> 34:36.740]  too. In a clinical study, men showed
[34:36.740 --> 34:38.680]  progressive improvement in hair growth and
[34:38.680 --> 34:40.520]  thickness after 3 and 6 months.

[35:21.420 --> 35:23.020]  New year, new poo
[35:23.020 --> 35:24.980]  year. Toilet paper is so

[35:36.760 --> 35:38.700]  with fresh water for a way
[35:38.700 --> 35:40.760]  better clean than toilet paper. You simply
[35:40.760 --> 35:42.900]  spray and pat dry. It attaches
[35:42.900 --> 35:45.040]  to your existing toilet. I'm going to go out on a limb
[35:45.040 --> 35:46.900]  and say you probably have at least one toilet
[35:46.900 --> 35:48.900]  in your home and you don't need
[35:48.900 --> 35:50.880]  an electrician or a plumber to install
[35:50.880 --> 35:52.800]  it. It's that simple. It takes less than
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.800]  8 minutes and it cuts down your TP
[35:54.800 --> 35:56.880]  use by 80%. That
[35:56.880 --> 35:58.900]  saves money and paper waste. This
[35:58.900 --> 36:00.860]  thing is going to pay for itself in no time. Make
[36:00.860 --> 36:02.640]  the restroom your best room

[36:31.580 --> 36:32.880]  Did you ever have stories
[36:32.880 --> 36:34.400]  as a kid? Like,
[36:35.160 --> 36:37.160]  as you get older, you get more stories.
[36:37.400 --> 36:38.960]  You get more things to tell, more experiences.
[36:39.740 --> 36:40.740]  Do you remember like
[36:40.740 --> 36:42.320]  the first...
[36:42.820 --> 36:44.820]  What? You just, you describe
[36:44.820 --> 36:46.560]  that like you're fucking Peter Molyneux.
[36:46.740 --> 36:48.720]  Like you're gonna sell me on a video game.
[36:48.940 --> 36:50.960]  Like you're on a stage and be like, you started
[36:50.960 --> 36:52.940]  as a child and as you grow, you gain
[36:52.940 --> 36:55.120]  more stories that enrich
[36:55.120 --> 36:56.580]  the lore of this universe.
[36:56.820 --> 36:58.780]  Alright, well forget that. That's obvious, isn't it?
[36:58.800 --> 37:01.180]  That's obvious. But do you remember like the first
[37:01.180 --> 37:02.840]  stories you used to tell people?
[37:03.380 --> 37:05.060]  Like, I'm not talking about like
[37:05.060 --> 37:06.840]  here's what I did at school today,
[37:06.960 --> 37:08.120]  mum. I'm talking about like
[37:08.900 --> 37:11.080]  a story that you thought was good enough
[37:11.080 --> 37:12.960]  to remember and tell other people.
[37:14.020 --> 37:14.920]  Yeah. Do you?
[37:15.460 --> 37:16.860]  Yeah, I remember three
[37:16.860 --> 37:19.000]  that I used, like my three go-to stories.
[37:19.080 --> 37:20.140]  Oh, yes!
[37:20.140 --> 37:21.560]  I thought
[37:21.960 --> 37:24.200]  at the time, I thought they were absolute
[37:24.200 --> 37:24.900]  bangers.
[37:27.080 --> 37:28.300]  And I must
[37:28.300 --> 37:29.940]  have been, what age was I?
[37:30.020 --> 37:32.160]  I was riding around on bikes, maybe like seven or eight.
[37:32.940 --> 37:34.240]  One of my stories was
[37:34.240 --> 37:36.140]  that I watched my
[37:36.140 --> 37:38.160]  friend ride his bike and
[37:38.160 --> 37:39.840]  he tried to spit at me,
[37:40.200 --> 37:41.900]  but it blew back in his face.
[37:42.140 --> 37:43.560]  I thought that was an amazing story.
[37:44.160 --> 37:46.080]  Another one was that my friend
[37:46.080 --> 37:48.120]  got a football stuck in his tree
[37:48.120 --> 37:49.940]  so he threw a broom up
[37:49.940 --> 37:52.080]  to try and get the football down and the
[37:52.080 --> 37:54.100]  broom got stuck. I thought that was an absolute
[37:54.100 --> 37:56.080]  knee slapper. And my last
[37:56.080 --> 37:58.020]  story, my last ghost tooth story
[37:58.020 --> 37:59.420]  was that it was once
[38:00.860 --> 38:02.100]  so windy that
[38:02.100 --> 38:03.060]  it rang the doorbell.
[38:03.380 --> 38:04.840]  Which I still think is a
[38:05.780 --> 38:06.840]  banger of a story.
[38:08.640 --> 38:10.060]  Those are bad stories.
[38:10.900 --> 38:11.860]  I think I should retire
[38:11.860 --> 38:14.040]  the first two, but I think
[38:14.040 --> 38:16.080]  it was the wind rang the doorbell
[38:16.080 --> 38:17.040]  so it's still a good story.
[38:17.320 --> 38:19.220]  I think I've told two of my
[38:19.880 --> 38:21.540]  stories on the podcast probably.
[38:22.780 --> 38:23.940]  One is that
[38:23.940 --> 38:25.960]  I tried to set up that
[38:25.960 --> 38:27.800]  bit where you dump water on somebody's head
[38:27.800 --> 38:29.860]  when they walk in a door by putting the bucket on top
[38:29.860 --> 38:30.300]  of the door.
[38:31.640 --> 38:33.900]  But I didn't tie it to anything so when my mom
[38:33.900 --> 38:35.380]  opened the door, a full bucket of water
[38:36.020 --> 38:37.620]  hit her in the head and I knocked her out.
[38:40.220 --> 38:41.860]  And there was that story I think
[38:41.860 --> 38:43.660]  I've told about how
[38:43.660 --> 38:45.280]  I jumped that ramp
[38:45.280 --> 38:47.700]  on my bike that everybody said
[38:47.700 --> 38:49.620]  I couldn't do and when I landed both of my tires
[38:49.620 --> 38:51.760]  popped and there was a bunch of smoke and I thought I had died.
[38:51.880 --> 38:53.280]  And I heard myself die.
[38:53.700 --> 38:55.560]  And I had to wait for the smoke to settle to realize
[38:55.560 --> 38:57.640]  I was still alive. And the other
[38:57.640 --> 38:59.440]  one that's probably my oldest story
[38:59.440 --> 39:01.200]  that I don't remember
[39:01.200 --> 39:03.420]  enough to tell it accurately is
[39:03.420 --> 39:05.500]  I remember playing... there was a
[39:05.500 --> 39:07.620]  hilarious sequence of events playing a game of
[39:07.620 --> 39:09.600]  Uno in the first grade with
[39:09.600 --> 39:11.860]  my friend Scott and I remember
[39:11.860 --> 39:14.140]  he said, I don't have any reds
[39:14.140 --> 39:15.840]  in a really funny way and I
[39:15.840 --> 39:17.440]  probably told that story until I was like 15.
[39:17.740 --> 39:18.800]  I wish I could remember it now.
[39:19.220 --> 39:22.060]  And I'd be like, and then Scott
[39:22.060 --> 39:23.920]  said, I don't have any reds!
[39:24.720 --> 39:25.740]  And I'm like laughing
[39:25.740 --> 39:26.980]  and people are like, what the fu... okay.
[39:28.160 --> 39:29.460]  But, you know, when you're
[39:29.460 --> 39:30.960]  nine, it's hilarious.
[39:31.940 --> 39:33.320]  You were nine in the first grade?
[39:34.100 --> 39:35.480]  How old was I in the first grade?
[39:35.800 --> 39:37.720]  This is Alabama. So I might have been
[39:37.720 --> 39:38.780]  16. I don't remember.
[39:40.620 --> 39:40.940]  So
[39:40.940 --> 39:42.840]  those are the first stories that you remember telling?
[39:43.520 --> 39:44.720]  Like the ones that you would cycle around?
[39:44.720 --> 39:46.900]  Those are like my bangers that I'd bring around.
[39:47.060 --> 39:47.860]  Oh, and the time
[39:48.680 --> 39:50.700]  I used to tell these other two stories.
[39:50.820 --> 39:52.820]  One, I loved
[39:52.820 --> 39:54.860]  telling this story because I thought it made me sound like a badass.
[39:55.480 --> 39:56.560]  I was digging.
[39:56.880 --> 39:58.820]  My friend had a pile of dirt in his backyard because they were doing
[39:58.820 --> 40:00.640]  some landscaping and that same
[40:00.640 --> 40:02.660]  kid, Scott, and I were digging
[40:03.340 --> 40:04.960]  with shovels and I got behind
[40:04.960 --> 40:06.780]  him and I wasn't paying attention and he swung the
[40:06.780 --> 40:08.840]  shovel behind him and hit me in the forehead and split my
[40:08.840 --> 40:10.660]  forehead open. And I was just gushing
[40:10.660 --> 40:12.900]  blood. And I went to his mom
[40:12.900 --> 40:14.780]  and I said, I need stitches, I need
[40:14.780 --> 40:16.840]  a bandaid or something. And she looked at me and she said, I have to
[40:16.840 --> 40:18.420]  take care of the baby, you need to go home.
[40:18.740 --> 40:20.820]  And I had to ride my bike home covered in blood
[40:20.820 --> 40:22.240]  and I was a latchkey kid.
[40:22.560 --> 40:24.980]  So my mom was at work so I just sat in the bathroom
[40:24.980 --> 40:26.640]  crying with like towels on my head
[40:26.640 --> 40:27.880]  while I just fucking bled
[40:28.680 --> 40:30.220]  like an inch over my eyeball.
[40:30.880 --> 40:32.080]  And then another time
[40:33.940 --> 40:34.940]  the other friend
[40:34.940 --> 40:36.340]  we had, a kid named Casey,
[40:36.980 --> 40:39.160]  we were fucking...
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.120]  we were at a construction site
[40:41.120 --> 40:42.780]  and there was a little fire there
[40:42.780 --> 40:44.840]  that somebody had built like at night and the kids or something
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.820]  and it was still going so we put a ramp
[40:46.820 --> 40:48.960]  and we were jumping over it on our bikes and he
[40:48.960 --> 40:50.860]  hit it wrong and fell and I thought he was gonna
[40:50.860 --> 40:52.780]  fall into the fire but he didn't. Instead
[40:52.780 --> 40:55.080]  he fell and impaled his neck on the rebar.
[40:56.220 --> 40:56.940]  Jesus Christ!
[40:57.720 --> 40:58.960]  Yeah, I'm not kidding dude.
[40:59.240 --> 41:00.940]  What? Yeah, threw like the side of his
[41:00.940 --> 41:02.320]  neck and came out the other end.
[41:02.680 --> 41:03.920]  Come on! What?
[41:04.180 --> 41:05.740]  I swear to God, I swear to God.
[41:06.160 --> 41:08.320]  He stood up, he like popped it off
[41:08.320 --> 41:10.460]  and there was like blood and I just ran him home.
[41:10.680 --> 41:11.400]  Didn't hurt him.
[41:11.580 --> 41:14.480]  It went one, it was like the tail
[41:14.480 --> 41:16.340]  on the far right of his neck
[41:16.340 --> 41:18.140]  like if you pull your neck out, it just like
[41:18.140 --> 41:20.620]  pierced it right there and it bled
[41:20.620 --> 41:22.240]  but it didn't hurt it. It didn't
[41:22.240 --> 41:24.160]  hit anything important. It was
[41:24.160 --> 41:26.100]  just stitches and a terrified
[41:26.100 --> 41:28.300]  trip to the emergency room and I don't think he was
[41:28.300 --> 41:29.880]  allowed to hang out with me after that. I think I
[41:29.880 --> 41:31.280]  for some reason got all the blame.
[41:32.580 --> 41:34.080]  He's like Shaun of the Dead
[41:34.080 --> 41:35.800]  at his own neck. Yeah,
[41:35.880 --> 41:37.960]  this would have been 1983 probably
[41:37.960 --> 41:39.920]  1982. It was fucking gross
[41:39.920 --> 41:40.460]  and scary.
[41:43.240 --> 41:44.040]  That's horrendous.
[41:44.720 --> 41:45.960]  Man, that's a way
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.040]  better story than the broom.
[41:47.520 --> 41:49.760]  No, I don't know. The broom's pretty good.
[41:50.140 --> 41:51.720]  Just how did he get the broom out? I didn't get nearly
[41:51.720 --> 41:53.920]  enough credit for getting Casey home that day.
[41:53.980 --> 41:55.840]  I got in a lot of trouble and I fucking saved
[41:55.840 --> 41:56.820]  that kid, but whatever.
[41:58.400 --> 41:59.640]  What about you, Andrew?
[42:00.340 --> 42:01.240]  I know I put you on the spot.
[42:01.640 --> 42:02.620]  I'm trying to think.
[42:04.060 --> 42:05.760]  I'll think about this more.
[42:05.860 --> 42:07.760]  There are two that immediately come to mind. I remember
[42:07.760 --> 42:09.960]  being like, I don't know,
[42:09.960 --> 42:11.340]  maybe five years old.
[42:11.600 --> 42:13.880]  I was at my grandparents' house and my grandpa
[42:13.880 --> 42:15.620]  was talking to our neighbor Jan
[42:16.080 --> 42:17.360]  and I decided that
[42:17.360 --> 42:19.780]  I want to get in on this conversation. I'm gonna
[42:19.780 --> 42:21.840]  need to have a real banger of a story
[42:21.840 --> 42:23.900]  to cut in and wow the
[42:23.900 --> 42:25.740]  room. And so there's
[42:25.740 --> 42:27.240]  a cop show on TV
[42:27.940 --> 42:29.660]  and I walked out and I was like,
[42:29.720 --> 42:31.840]  I'll just make up some story. I'll be like,
[42:31.940 --> 42:33.500]  I walked out and I said something like,
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.780]  did you just see that on the news there's this guy
[42:35.780 --> 42:37.360]  who solved crimes and he dodged
[42:37.360 --> 42:39.700]  eight bullets? And a five-year-old
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.580]  brain, I was like, this is the coolest story ever.
[42:41.940 --> 42:43.140]  And they immediately said,
[42:43.340 --> 42:45.300]  that was a show
[42:46.100 --> 42:47.040]  that's not real.
[42:47.520 --> 42:49.440]  What you just said didn't actually happen.
[42:49.820 --> 42:51.520]  And I just walked away dejected.
[42:52.200 --> 42:53.640]  They just shut you down.
[42:53.640 --> 42:55.260]  They shut me down immediately and it
[42:55.260 --> 42:57.440]  was fair to the other story. It's not so much
[42:57.440 --> 42:59.380]  a story. This is just
[42:59.380 --> 43:01.600]  embarrassing. I remember getting
[43:01.600 --> 43:03.120]  Xbox Live when I was like 10
[43:04.640 --> 43:05.600]  and as a
[43:05.600 --> 43:07.620]  10-year-old playing Xbox Live, this
[43:07.620 --> 43:09.500]  was a time where people actually talked on Xbox
[43:09.500 --> 43:11.420]  Live. There were party chats. So you'd go into
[43:11.420 --> 43:13.540]  lobbies and I had like
[43:13.540 --> 43:15.480]  my go-to move at that time because it's like
[43:15.480 --> 43:17.560]  2004 and
[43:17.560 --> 43:19.480]  I'm a 10-year-old. I would like
[43:19.480 --> 43:21.540]  essentially every conversation I'd be like, so you watch
[43:21.540 --> 43:23.560]  Family Guy? That was like my cut-in
[43:23.560 --> 43:25.540]  to it. And I had, it was
[43:25.540 --> 43:27.480]  set up in the living room. And I
[43:27.480 --> 43:29.220]  joined like a lobby once.
[43:30.020 --> 43:31.560]  And as soon as I joined
[43:31.560 --> 43:33.680]  I was like, hey. And my mom from the kitchen
[43:33.680 --> 43:35.140]  went, so you guys watch Family Guy?
[43:35.460 --> 43:37.500]  Making fun of me. And I've ever
[43:37.500 --> 43:39.720]  since that moment have a hyper
[43:39.720 --> 43:41.440]  awareness if I'm in a room with anybody
[43:41.440 --> 43:43.600]  else that I'm talking. I was, it might be the most
[43:43.600 --> 43:45.240]  embarrassed I've ever been in my life.
[43:45.760 --> 43:47.360]  And to this day, I
[43:47.360 --> 43:49.640]  struggle with talking with somebody else in the
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.480]  room. Like if it's a phone call, it doesn't matter
[43:51.480 --> 43:53.600]  what it is. Because of Family
[43:53.600 --> 43:55.340]  Guy. And that's just burning into my brain.
[43:55.520 --> 43:57.520]  So she just knew you, that you were gonna
[43:57.520 --> 43:59.500]  say it? Oh, she knew. Cause I said it
[43:59.500 --> 44:01.700]  fucking 97 times a day.
[44:01.860 --> 44:03.660]  Every time I joined a Halo lobby.
[44:03.880 --> 44:05.560]  So she just immediately said it.
[44:05.720 --> 44:07.660]  And it just was def, cause I
[44:07.660 --> 44:09.640]  knew how lame it was, even at that time.
[44:09.680 --> 44:11.300]  But to get called out on it.
[44:11.580 --> 44:13.760]  Is that why we can't do this podcast in person?
[44:14.120 --> 44:14.940]  Cause you're still in person.
[44:16.720 --> 44:17.680]  Yes. That's the
[44:17.680 --> 44:19.760]  only reason. I'm starting to realize
[44:19.760 --> 44:21.120]  why you are the way that you are.
[44:21.500 --> 44:22.540]  Really? It was that?
[44:24.240 --> 44:25.760]  What did you uncover from
[44:25.760 --> 44:27.720]  that? You got from there to the
[44:27.720 --> 44:28.060]  pencil.
[44:31.960 --> 44:33.340]  What did that make you realize? I don't know, just people
[44:33.340 --> 44:35.520]  just like chewing down your confidence
[44:35.520 --> 44:37.660]  and then you're just like overthinking stuff
[44:37.660 --> 44:39.780]  to the point where you're just an insane
[44:39.780 --> 44:41.660]  person. Well, I, okay. Makes
[44:41.660 --> 44:43.660]  total sense. I, I, it's funny that
[44:43.660 --> 44:45.540]  you say that cause I had one of those recently.
[44:45.540 --> 44:47.560]  I recorded a second episode
[44:47.560 --> 44:49.340]  of the Q&A thing that I'm doing.
[44:49.620 --> 44:51.340]  And one of the questions was
[44:51.340 --> 44:53.600]  what is your favorite holiday treat?
[44:53.780 --> 44:55.700]  And I opened with, is eggnog a treat?
[44:55.760 --> 44:57.760]  Like, I went in on eggnog specifically.
[44:58.040 --> 44:59.620]  A thing I've never had.
[45:00.040 --> 45:01.760]  And Eric called me out for it.
[45:01.820 --> 45:03.260]  And he's like, you are a psychopath.
[45:03.560 --> 45:05.460]  The question is, what is your favorite? Why are you
[45:05.460 --> 45:06.800]  talking about a thing you've never had?
[45:07.020 --> 45:09.340]  The reason why I did that is because
[45:09.340 --> 45:11.600]  that was the third version of that recording
[45:11.600 --> 45:13.760]  I had done. And I didn't want to answer
[45:13.760 --> 45:15.800]  it in the exact same way that I
[45:15.800 --> 45:17.820]  answered the previous recording. I didn't like how
[45:17.820 --> 45:19.900]  they came out the other two. So that was the
[45:19.900 --> 45:21.600]  third time I had answered that question.
[45:21.800 --> 45:23.800]  And I felt like even though nobody would hear
[45:23.800 --> 45:25.740]  the other two, in my head it
[45:25.740 --> 45:27.860]  was lame to use the same answer
[45:27.860 --> 45:29.800]  over and over again. So I was like, how
[45:29.800 --> 45:31.920]  do I switch this up a little bit? I'll make
[45:31.920 --> 45:33.740]  a little comment about eggnog and it
[45:33.740 --> 45:34.800]  just seems insane.
[45:36.480 --> 45:37.840]  I like the idea of like
[45:37.840 --> 45:39.980]  a celebrity doing interviews
[45:39.980 --> 45:42.000]  but they never want to answer the same way
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.060]  like on all the talk shows. They just start telling
[45:44.060 --> 45:45.500]  lies and making up shit.
[45:45.800 --> 45:48.080]  I was not telling lies. I was just like, how can I
[45:48.080 --> 45:50.000]  No, but I was saying
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.880]  I never said I did. I said
[45:51.880 --> 45:54.180]  is it considered a holiday treat?
[45:54.620 --> 45:56.360]  Why would you give that answer
[45:56.360 --> 45:58.100]  though? Is the thing that I
[45:58.100 --> 46:00.120]  was bringing up to you. Is the question
[46:00.120 --> 46:02.100]  was what's your favorite holiday treat
[46:02.100 --> 46:04.180]  and you said, is eggnog a holiday
[46:04.180 --> 46:06.280]  treat? I've never had it.
[46:06.440 --> 46:07.860]  Yeah, because I'm trying to spice it up.
[46:07.860 --> 46:10.200]  What's your favorite holiday treat you've never had?
[46:10.200 --> 46:12.280]  No, you fucking, you guys are missing
[46:12.280 --> 46:14.240]  the thing entirely. I answered that two
[46:14.240 --> 46:16.020]  times already and I just answered
[46:16.020 --> 46:18.180]  clearly like, these are what I view as
[46:18.180 --> 46:20.300]  since it was my third time, I didn't want to duplicate
[46:20.300 --> 46:22.260]  that. So in the moment, I'm like, how
[46:22.260 --> 46:24.140]  can I spice this answer up a bit?
[46:24.380 --> 46:26.240]  I'll do a thing about eggnog. I'll talk about
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.260]  eggnog for like 10 seconds and then
[46:28.260 --> 46:29.760]  I'll get into the exact same thing.
[46:30.140 --> 46:32.300]  No one else has heard it. I know, but that's how my brain
[46:32.300 --> 46:34.140]  works. I'm saying this
[46:34.140 --> 46:36.300]  is how Gavin's right. I'm overthinking this
[46:36.300 --> 46:38.140]  thing that nobody's gonna hear but I'm like
[46:38.140 --> 46:39.820]  I can't say the same thing three times.
[46:40.540 --> 46:42.100]  You've been left with this weird level
[46:42.100 --> 46:44.200]  of confidence where you overthink everything
[46:44.200 --> 46:45.860]  and then you over
[46:45.860 --> 46:48.280]  correct and just go blasting
[46:48.280 --> 46:50.120]  in with all this crazy confidence in
[46:50.120 --> 46:51.360]  other directions. You're
[46:52.140 --> 46:53.580]  nothing works about you.
[46:56.840 --> 46:58.320]  That's maybe the meanest
[46:58.320 --> 46:59.800]  thing anyone's ever said to me.
[47:00.940 --> 47:02.360]  I don't think it's mean.
[47:02.360 --> 47:03.660]  I don't think that's mean.
[47:04.340 --> 47:05.980]  Nothing works about you.
[47:05.980 --> 47:08.220]  I think lots works on you.
[47:08.300 --> 47:09.380]  It just works weirdly.
[47:10.340 --> 47:12.280]  Nothing works as you'd expect
[47:12.280 --> 47:13.520]  and what it produces
[47:13.520 --> 47:15.880]  is actually a very nice
[47:15.880 --> 47:17.760]  and very funny person.
[47:18.640 --> 47:20.140]  It's all like built on
[47:20.140 --> 47:20.800]  what?
[47:21.540 --> 47:23.480]  Nice unless your name is Kevin Donovan.
[47:24.140 --> 47:26.340]  No, I was nice to Kevin Donovan.
[47:26.840 --> 47:27.900]  All my interactions with him.
[47:28.300 --> 47:30.060]  Directly. I would argue that reaching
[47:30.060 --> 47:32.020]  out to him at all is not nice.
[47:32.580 --> 47:34.260]  Really? I don't view it that way.
[47:35.300 --> 47:36.460]  Knowing what was coming?
[47:36.800 --> 47:38.400]  I do. Like that man could have
[47:38.400 --> 47:40.360]  lived in blissful ignorance for the rest of his
[47:40.360 --> 47:42.240]  life not bothering to know
[47:42.240 --> 47:44.060]  that the three of us hated his fucking movie.
[47:44.760 --> 47:46.540]  But you chose to initiate contact.
[47:47.020 --> 47:48.260]  You chose first
[47:48.260 --> 47:50.720]  contact. Nah, I
[47:50.720 --> 47:51.660]  don't know. I don't see...
[47:51.660 --> 47:54.000]  I disagree. I respectfully disagree.
[47:54.720 --> 47:56.180]  I think there's a world in which we become
[47:56.180 --> 47:58.260]  great friends with Kevin Donovan and none of that would
[47:58.260 --> 47:59.580]  have been possible. I hope so.
[48:00.140 --> 48:02.200]  Hell of a recovery. Imagine if
[48:02.200 --> 48:04.420]  Kevin Donovan directs the Child Kicker movie.
[48:04.860 --> 48:06.320]  Make that into a thing.
[48:07.240 --> 48:08.220]  Best case scenario,
[48:08.300 --> 48:10.300]  Kevin Donovan becomes a full-time member of this podcast.
[48:10.680 --> 48:12.000]  I would love to have... Maybe he's the piece we're missing.
[48:12.620 --> 48:14.040]  Can we... I don't know.
[48:14.100 --> 48:15.880]  Maybe like do... I don't know.
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.760]  Get Kevin Donovan involved in some way.
[48:18.320 --> 48:19.820]  I'd love to have Kevin Donovan.
[48:19.820 --> 48:22.120]  If he gets involved, I'm buying him like a hamper
[48:22.120 --> 48:24.400]  or something. We gotta make some sort of nice gesture.
[48:25.700 --> 48:26.360]  I agree.
[48:26.480 --> 48:27.700]  I'd love to get a fruit basket.
[48:27.880 --> 48:30.300]  Maybe like some nice jams. I don't know.
[48:30.300 --> 48:31.900]  Cosmic collision of jams.
[48:32.300 --> 48:33.780]  Maybe. I don't know.
[48:33.920 --> 48:36.260]  We can send him an apple
[48:36.260 --> 48:37.620]  basket that you weave.
[48:38.340 --> 48:40.140]  I don't know if that will
[48:40.140 --> 48:41.960]  mend without context.
[48:42.420 --> 48:44.400]  There's no context. A man
[48:44.400 --> 48:45.980]  just receives a poorly woven
[48:45.980 --> 48:48.280]  basket full of
[48:48.280 --> 48:50.380]  a specific apple and he just goes
[48:50.380 --> 48:51.560]  what did I do?
[48:51.960 --> 48:54.220]  What if a Canadian sent me a crushed
[48:54.220 --> 48:55.280]  tumbleweed in the mail?
[48:55.280 --> 48:55.400]  I don't know.
[49:00.260 --> 49:02.540]  So I had Kevin Donovan
[49:02.540 --> 49:03.800]  and I had one other thing
[49:04.600 --> 49:06.620]  that I wanted to talk about that is
[49:06.620 --> 49:08.620]  a very funny discovery.
[49:08.860 --> 49:10.500]  I have a new nickname.
[49:11.100 --> 49:12.140]  I have a new nickname.
[49:12.660 --> 49:14.200]  That is exciting.
[49:16.900 --> 49:18.140]  Somebody emailed in.
[49:18.660 --> 49:20.060]  Somebody emailed this to me.
[49:20.700 --> 49:22.500]  They were looking
[49:22.500 --> 49:24.380]  through like just news archive
[49:24.380 --> 49:26.140]  stuff. You know like they're just searching
[49:26.140 --> 49:27.180]  different news clippings.
[49:27.420 --> 49:28.960]  And they found
[49:30.160 --> 49:31.940]  a news clipping of me when I'm like
[49:31.940 --> 49:33.840]  7 playing tennis.
[49:34.200 --> 49:35.340]  You were in the news?
[49:35.500 --> 49:37.840]  I remember this happening too. I used to do
[49:37.840 --> 49:39.500]  tennis lessons at this place.
[49:39.900 --> 49:41.720]  But I was in the news. They filmed it. Probably
[49:41.720 --> 49:44.180]  trying to do advertising for their tennis program
[49:44.180 --> 49:46.060]  that they're doing. Is it Foster's
[49:46.060 --> 49:46.500]  Sewing Machine?
[49:47.300 --> 49:50.060]  It is a continuation. This is the
[49:50.060 --> 49:52.060]  entry point of me eventually learning
[49:52.060 --> 49:54.220]  the sewing machine. Let me introduce you
[49:54.220 --> 49:55.440]  to Andrew
[49:56.060 --> 49:57.600]  Sweet Swing Panton.
[49:58.660 --> 49:59.820]  Oh my
[50:00.720 --> 50:02.420]  God, you're adorable.
[50:03.120 --> 50:04.160]  I was expecting some
[50:04.160 --> 50:06.100]  like distant photo
[50:06.100 --> 50:07.080]  of a bunch of...
[50:07.080 --> 50:10.260]  They treat you like you're freaking Roger Federer.
[50:10.460 --> 50:11.660]  Look at the picture.
[50:12.060 --> 50:13.680]  The wording on it is really funny.
[50:13.840 --> 50:15.780]  Andrew Panton keeps his eye on the ball
[50:15.780 --> 50:17.380]  in preparation for his return.
[50:18.200 --> 50:20.100]  He does not. Your eyes are
[50:20.100 --> 50:21.340]  nowhere near that ball, dude.
[50:21.840 --> 50:23.680]  You are spiking the lens.
[50:23.820 --> 50:25.900]  The phrasing of the return is like I am
[50:25.900 --> 50:28.080]  this tennis prodigy that got hurt
[50:28.080 --> 50:29.520]  and I'm now coming back to the game.
[50:30.500 --> 50:31.300]  Yeah, so
[50:31.300 --> 50:33.980]  I feel so bad. I'll credit next time,
[50:34.060 --> 50:36.140]  next episode, I'll give proper credit to the person who found
[50:36.140 --> 50:37.480]  this. So the person found it
[50:38.640 --> 50:39.700]  and they're like,
[50:39.840 --> 50:41.460]  look at this ridiculous thing I found.
[50:41.840 --> 50:44.220]  They then took it even further
[50:44.220 --> 50:45.980]  and they made Andrew Panton
[50:45.980 --> 50:47.200]  Sweet Swing rookie cards.
[50:47.200 --> 50:49.160]  This is in existence.
[50:49.380 --> 50:50.620]  They went to the Topps website.
[50:51.400 --> 50:52.500]  They made a collection
[50:53.400 --> 50:55.460]  of Andrew Sweet Swing Pantons as a rookie.
[50:55.580 --> 50:57.160]  We need to sell those
[50:57.160 --> 50:59.320]  in our card thing someday. That's brilliant.
[50:59.620 --> 51:01.340]  The fact that it's taken from a black and white
[51:01.340 --> 51:02.480]  newspaper, clearly,
[51:02.760 --> 51:05.040]  you could look at that and have no idea
[51:05.040 --> 51:06.180]  what year that was.
[51:06.920 --> 51:08.740]  That could easily be from the 40s.
[51:08.840 --> 51:10.840]  I guess the tennis racket style gives it away.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.700]  It looks like 1975
[51:13.380 --> 51:14.180]  to me.
[51:14.180 --> 51:15.800]  It's a 19, I'd say 99
[51:15.800 --> 51:17.540]  would be my guess. What brand
[51:18.100 --> 51:20.340]  racket are you rocking there? Oh, that's a good
[51:21.080 --> 51:21.900]  head, maybe?
[51:22.280 --> 51:23.880]  Is that one of the...
[51:23.880 --> 51:26.000]  I was always a Schlesinger
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.520]  kind of guy. I've never heard of Schlesinger.
[51:29.740 --> 51:30.120]  Is it head?
[51:30.120 --> 51:32.180]  Oh, it is head. Look at me, I fucking called the logo.
[51:32.200 --> 51:33.900]  I swing a
[51:33.900 --> 51:35.900]  Babalot myself. A Babalot?
[51:37.120 --> 51:38.160]  Although I can't
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.760]  play tennis anymore right now.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.220]  But when I get back to it...
[51:42.220 --> 51:43.320]  Dude, you're a cute kid.
[51:44.440 --> 51:45.900]  You know why I can't play
[51:47.680 --> 51:48.080]  arthritis
[51:48.080 --> 51:48.760]  and injuries.
[51:49.920 --> 51:52.040]  I thought it was because you're training to throw
[51:52.040 --> 51:53.920]  a faster ball.
[51:54.360 --> 51:56.080]  I can't even get to the training yet
[51:56.080 --> 51:58.240]  right now because of all the other issues. But that's okay. I don't want to talk
[51:58.240 --> 51:59.800]  about me and my broken old ass body.
[51:59.920 --> 52:02.220]  Geoff, do you remember when you committed to hitting a thousand
[52:02.780 --> 52:03.180]  baseballs?
[52:03.880 --> 52:06.340]  Dude, the baseballs are in.
[52:06.420 --> 52:08.340]  I gotta do that. What do you mean they're in?
[52:09.040 --> 52:10.280]  Mallory told me the baseballs
[52:10.280 --> 52:11.900]  are here. But you can't do that.
[52:11.980 --> 52:13.660]  There's no way that you can...
[52:13.660 --> 52:16.120]  If you're not in a state in which you can't play
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.960]  tennis, you can't hit a thousand
[52:17.960 --> 52:20.040]  balls. Well, I
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.600]  can't play tennis for fun,
[52:21.880 --> 52:23.940]  but I can hit a thousand balls
[52:23.940 --> 52:26.080]  and do more damage to myself for
[52:26.080 --> 52:27.260]  my job.
[52:27.620 --> 52:28.440]  I'll do that.
[52:29.660 --> 52:30.760]  That's just sad.
[52:31.860 --> 52:32.500]  I know.
[52:33.580 --> 52:34.500]  There's no way.
[52:34.900 --> 52:37.900]  I think you might die if you hit more
[52:37.900 --> 52:39.460]  than... I'm gonna say
[52:39.940 --> 52:40.380]  115.
[52:42.620 --> 52:43.060]  Eric,
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.900]  can you get that set up? Thanks, bud. Appreciate it.
[52:47.200 --> 52:47.900]  God, we're
[52:48.360 --> 52:49.920]  almost an hour in already.
[52:50.420 --> 52:51.920]  I love that photo of
[52:51.920 --> 52:53.900]  Patton so much. That is such a great
[52:53.900 --> 52:55.800]  photo. It's just like
[52:55.800 --> 52:57.520]  a really good picture.
[52:58.200 --> 52:59.360]  Can we put on a shirt?
[52:59.900 --> 53:02.060]  I've never looked that cool
[53:02.060 --> 53:03.460]  in a still image in all my life.
[53:03.460 --> 53:05.620]  I don't think I look cool in that photo at all.
[53:05.620 --> 53:06.300]  You do.
[53:06.480 --> 53:09.540]  How many kids
[53:09.540 --> 53:11.520]  have a properly professional action
[53:11.520 --> 53:12.580]  shot taken of them?
[53:13.120 --> 53:15.500]  I will say that that photo has
[53:15.500 --> 53:17.560]  more of an action shot than 90%
[53:17.560 --> 53:18.780]  of the baseball cards we open.
[53:19.260 --> 53:20.120]  It's true.
[53:21.300 --> 53:22.680]  Balls in frame, it is a good photo.
[53:23.640 --> 53:25.480]  Between that and your Men in Black
[53:25.480 --> 53:26.360]  photos, dude,
[53:27.140 --> 53:29.220]  I can't wait to see what else you've got
[53:29.220 --> 53:30.100]  you're holding on to.
[53:30.740 --> 53:32.660]  I think those might be the greatest hits.
[53:32.660 --> 53:34.780]  I remember the Men in Black
[53:35.260 --> 53:36.420]  getting that for Halloween
[53:36.420 --> 53:38.660]  and renting the suits and having to
[53:38.660 --> 53:39.940]  lie that I was going to a wedding
[53:40.560 --> 53:42.160]  for it. That's my main memory.
[53:43.140 --> 53:44.760]  Are we going to post those with a tuxedo?
[53:45.280 --> 53:46.040]  I hope so.
[53:47.380 --> 53:48.420]  There's another photo.
[53:49.520 --> 53:50.320]  I want to
[53:50.320 --> 53:52.060]  make posters and sell them.
[53:52.160 --> 53:53.940]  I want the world to have them.
[53:54.360 --> 53:56.540]  It's genuinely the last time I wore a tuxedo
[53:56.540 --> 53:58.200]  and I think there's only one other time
[53:58.200 --> 54:00.100]  and there's a photo of it somewhere that I'll try to find.
[54:00.100 --> 54:01.560]  It's a terrible photo.
[54:01.940 --> 54:03.800]  I think I've only worn it twice.
[54:04.540 --> 54:04.940]  Tuxedo.
[54:05.900 --> 54:08.280]  Well, does anybody have anything else they want to cover
[54:08.280 --> 54:09.040]  before we end?
[54:10.180 --> 54:11.740]  Not anything that
[54:12.780 --> 54:14.200]  I would say is
[54:14.200 --> 54:15.020]  expansive.
[54:15.800 --> 54:17.920]  I have one little thing
[54:17.920 --> 54:19.660]  if Gavin or...
[54:19.660 --> 54:22.160]  This is more directed to the audience.
[54:22.660 --> 54:24.160]  So, I tried to mention this
[54:24.160 --> 54:26.120]  a couple episodes ago but I got distracted
[54:26.120 --> 54:26.940]  but I have
[54:27.620 --> 54:28.960]  I've been thinking a lot about
[54:29.400 --> 54:30.400]  well, first off
[54:30.840 --> 54:33.080]  let me say, I've been hanging out a lot in
[54:33.660 --> 54:35.220]  laundromats and I'm really into it
[54:35.220 --> 54:36.800]  I'm really digging laundromats these days.
[54:36.900 --> 54:37.160]  Why?
[54:39.360 --> 54:41.140]  They smell good, first of all
[54:41.140 --> 54:43.340]  and they're warm on a cold day
[54:43.340 --> 54:44.640]  not that we have a lot of those
[54:44.640 --> 54:46.140]  and they're empty
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.520]  and there's like a rhythmic
[54:49.480 --> 54:51.060]  thumping and sound of all
[54:51.060 --> 54:52.220]  the machines going on at once
[54:52.820 --> 54:54.560]  But you're not doing laundry.
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.780]  Corded. And I'm doing laundry.
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.360]  You are doing laundry.
[54:58.820 --> 55:00.220]  Yeah, no, I don't hang out at laundromats
[55:00.220 --> 55:02.800]  just to hang out yet, but I could get there.
[55:03.180 --> 55:04.460]  You made it sound like you were because
[55:04.460 --> 55:07.040]  I assume you have a washing machine.
[55:07.500 --> 55:08.740]  I do, I do, but you know
[55:08.740 --> 55:10.200]  Henry, the bulldog
[55:10.860 --> 55:12.680]  he has problems with
[55:12.680 --> 55:14.180]  his pee-pee and sometimes at night
[55:14.180 --> 55:15.040]  and so he wears a diaper
[55:15.780 --> 55:18.320]  and then sometimes it doesn't get it or sometimes he wiggles out
[55:18.320 --> 55:20.880]  and sometimes the sheets
[55:20.880 --> 55:22.660]  the duvet and everything get a little
[55:22.660 --> 55:24.760]  Henry on them and it's
[55:24.760 --> 55:26.600]  hard to wash king-size
[55:26.600 --> 55:28.600]  duvets and dry them
[55:28.600 --> 55:30.700]  in my washer and dryer
[55:30.700 --> 55:32.620]  so we've started going to the laundromat
[55:32.620 --> 55:34.420]  where you can knock it out in no time at all
[55:34.420 --> 55:35.980]  like in those industrial dryers
[55:36.580 --> 55:38.140]  and industrial washers
[55:38.140 --> 55:40.280]  and I just quite enjoy the laundromat
[55:40.280 --> 55:41.100]  so I've been thinking
[55:42.180 --> 55:44.260]  maybe into my post-Rooster Teeth
[55:44.260 --> 55:46.320]  post-podcasting career when it's time
[55:46.320 --> 55:47.860]  to settle down and retire
[55:47.860 --> 55:49.900]  I don't think I'll ever want to stop working
[55:49.900 --> 55:52.880]  But what I do think I want to do is open up a laundromat.
[55:52.980 --> 55:55.940]  I think that might be my second act is being a laundromat owner.
[55:56.140 --> 55:58.740]  So I wanted to talk to the I want to talk to the audience.
[55:58.880 --> 56:02.280]  If anybody out there owns a laundromat, has experience running or managing
[56:02.280 --> 56:04.240]  a laundromat, what was it like? Did you enjoy it?
[56:04.260 --> 56:06.320]  Is it as much fun as I think it would be? Is it profitable?
[56:06.520 --> 56:07.420]  I'd love to know.
[56:07.720 --> 56:10.960]  Just email Andrew and then he can filter all that to me.
[56:11.860 --> 56:14.600]  And yeah, I just I would love to hear your laundromat feedback
[56:14.600 --> 56:17.660]  or your personal experiences with laundromats,
[56:17.660 --> 56:20.460]  because I'm really fucking jazzed about them right now.
[56:20.840 --> 56:22.780]  It's weird that that was like the one appliance
[56:22.780 --> 56:26.700]  that could be put in a different building and run as a business.
[56:27.020 --> 56:28.080]  Well, you don't you don't get business.
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.440]  It's just like 18 fridges and you could just keep stuff cold.
[56:33.260 --> 56:34.540]  Like a freeze on that.
[56:35.040 --> 56:35.940]  A cool on that.
[56:36.500 --> 56:39.220]  Yeah. Like if you can't, if you have room for your own fridge,
[56:39.480 --> 56:41.880]  just keep your shit in a fridge-o-mat.
[56:42.200 --> 56:46.860]  Yeah. Or like, oh, do you do you need some extra space for your casserole?
[56:46.860 --> 56:47.920]  Come on over to Oven Mat.
[56:51.220 --> 56:53.980]  You call ahead, we'll preheat it to whatever you 425.
[56:54.180 --> 56:55.180]  It'll be waiting for you.
[56:57.380 --> 56:59.720]  You just text the preheat to the oven.
[57:02.060 --> 57:06.280]  Anyway, I would love to if you've ever worked in a laundromat or owned one,
[57:06.340 --> 57:08.080]  please let Andrew know and he can let me know.
[57:08.340 --> 57:09.760]  I don't think I've ever been inside one.
[57:10.480 --> 57:11.280]  I want to check.
[57:11.640 --> 57:12.380]  Maybe I'll watch some.
[57:12.960 --> 57:13.840]  Yeah, maybe a big.
[57:13.960 --> 57:15.780]  Come on to the laundromat with me someday.
[57:15.780 --> 57:17.100]  Hang out with me at the laundromat.
[57:17.800 --> 57:19.060]  And we'll spend some time together.
[57:19.860 --> 57:23.500]  I like that I started off as a fan of Rooster Teeth
[57:23.500 --> 57:28.140]  and I end up later in life doing laundry with one of the guys that started it in a laundromat.
[57:28.780 --> 57:30.380]  We're just hanging out doing our laundry.
[57:30.720 --> 57:31.900]  That's great. I'd love to do that.
[57:32.340 --> 57:35.940]  Yeah, I'm looking, you know, I don't think I ever want to stop completely.
[57:36.100 --> 57:39.880]  But at some point, I don't know that I want the high stress, high pressure
[57:42.900 --> 57:44.040]  career that I've had,
[57:44.040 --> 57:48.020]  constantly reinventing yourself and trying to be funny and create new products
[57:48.020 --> 57:53.240]  and all share all of these foibles of, you know, at some point, I'm going to be tired of that.
[57:53.560 --> 57:57.640]  And man, laundromats smell good and they're the perfect temperature.
[57:57.880 --> 57:58.600]  And they're there.
[57:58.980 --> 58:00.060]  They have a nice hum.
[58:00.500 --> 58:01.440]  It's and they're empty.
[58:02.040 --> 58:02.740]  People come in.
[58:02.860 --> 58:04.140]  They throw their clothes in and they leave.
[58:04.280 --> 58:07.640]  That's also something I like about laundromats, or at least the laundromat I've been going to,
[58:07.760 --> 58:11.400]  is that there seems to be it seems to be populated
[58:11.400 --> 58:16.860]  and propagated by decent human beings that understand that they're all in the same boat.
[58:17.300 --> 58:19.900]  You know, like I remember when I worked in a lived in an apartment complex,
[58:20.100 --> 58:22.140]  I would do laundry and sometimes I'd come back and I'd be like,
[58:22.220 --> 58:23.460]  somebody stole my fucking pants.
[58:23.920 --> 58:27.440]  Somebody else out there is a 32, 29 or whatever and stole my fucking blue jeans.
[58:27.700 --> 58:30.120]  That doesn't seem to happen at a laundromat.
[58:30.180 --> 58:32.280]  People seem to be respectful of each other's stuff.
[58:32.440 --> 58:33.380]  And I appreciate that, too.
[58:33.420 --> 58:36.320]  It's like it's like a place where decorum still exists in the world.
[58:36.700 --> 58:40.460]  It does seem like there's a very unique person.
[58:40.460 --> 58:42.960]  I don't know, like personality isn't the right word.
[58:43.320 --> 58:47.800]  I feel like if you discover, once you discover the laundromat,
[58:47.860 --> 58:51.660]  you don't go back unless you are in a situation which like if it makes sense
[58:51.660 --> 58:56.260]  to use laundromat for your lifestyle or whatever, it would be extremely useful.
[58:56.940 --> 58:59.440]  I wonder what the maintenance is like, like how often you have to clean them.
[58:59.820 --> 59:03.700]  And I mean, potentially you've got like 40 plumbing problems about to happen.
[59:04.180 --> 59:07.840]  I was trying to get in, get behind and kind of look at the machinations of it
[59:07.840 --> 59:12.160]  and stuff, and I get a sense that because these machines look old as dirt,
[59:12.300 --> 59:13.560]  but they still seem to be running fine.
[59:13.760 --> 59:15.020]  I think they're built to last.
[59:15.360 --> 59:16.540]  I'm sure that there's maintenance.
[59:17.080 --> 59:20.820]  I'm sure there are problems you have to deal with.
[59:20.880 --> 59:22.260]  I imagine it would be quite scary.
[59:22.620 --> 59:25.640]  It would have been a quite a scary place to own in the freeze last year.
[59:26.300 --> 59:28.880]  But I get the impression all the time.
[59:29.720 --> 59:32.560]  Yeah, I get the impression that I mean, it basically runs itself.
[59:32.640 --> 59:35.000]  You know that they're there. You just provide electricity.
[59:35.360 --> 59:37.860]  There's a thing you can go buy soap and shit if you need to.
[59:37.960 --> 59:39.180]  It's all coin operated.
[59:39.300 --> 59:40.880]  All you have to do is have a change machine in there.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.220]  And then like I've been in that laundromat probably four or five times
[59:44.220 --> 59:48.360]  over the last few since Thanksgiving, and I've never seen anybody working there.
[59:48.740 --> 59:52.680]  Yeah, I was about to say, I feel like it would be great for money laundering.
[59:52.720 --> 59:53.680]  You don't really need a staff.
[59:53.900 --> 59:56.640]  Well, I have a business in the name. Yeah.
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.780]  It's a little on the nose that at that point is it would be like obnoxious
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.800]  to make a laundromat your money laundering operation.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.320]  You should see if you could call it money.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.180]  Oh, Eric's in the same thing to call it money laundromat and see if it raises
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:12.700]  any money.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.040]  Well, I wasn't sure what what today's podcast was going to be like coming in,
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.720]  but I quite enjoyed it.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:29.420]  So obviously this is coming out, I don't know, third week of January or something.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:33.240]  But this was recorded on well, it was recorded on January 6th.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.440]  So I liked it.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.560]  It's the first time I've talked to you guys in the new year.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.920]  So I just want to say I enjoyed it.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.960]  And I hope you guys are having I hope you had a good New Year's Eve.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.120]  And I hope you have a good new year.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.380]  And I hope you listen to this podcast and all the future ones.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.440]  Not you. I'm not talking.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.840]  I was talking to you. Now I'm talking to the audience.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.920]  I realize you kind of pivoted mid-sentence.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.020]  I pivoted mid-sentence.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.080]  Yeah, no, I pivoted mid-sentence.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.120]  And then I realized that's why I called it out.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.480]  Yeah, don't move on my part.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.020]  That's the end of this one.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.140]  So if you, I don't know, just fucking...
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.200]  What's our newest merch item?
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.620]  Oh, did you see there's a Grown Tube update?
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.200]  Fucksticks, right?
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:09.480]  In the Slack.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.120]  There's a fuckstick update that's interesting.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:13.780]  Are they delayed?
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:14.620]  No.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.640]  It's an interesting update.
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.000]  I'd say it's a positive one.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.420]  Well, tell us what it is, dude.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.860]  What is it?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.980]  Well, I don't...
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.200]  I'm going to go fucking look for it.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.020]  It's just, it's different colors.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.040]  We can talk about it.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.980]  Now we can end the show and talk about business for like three minutes until Geoff goes, I gotta go.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.660]  And then...
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.720]  Okay, fuckface team, the Grown Tube situation has evolved.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.700]  Oh my god.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.900]  What are you doing?
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.960]  I'm just reading what it says.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.980]  Right, but we don't have to. It's not for the episode.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.640]  This is for us.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.180]  Orange is common with 600 units.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:52.180]  We don't have to do what he's laying out. This is his idea for the way he's laying it out with like these colors.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.860]  I like it. I like the colors.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.260]  You're saying we can't do white because white is too expensive?
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.580]  They don't, and you can only get it from one manufacturer.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.620]  You know those, like when you throw a bouncy ball and it like lights up the different colors?
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:05.700]  Like that magnet?
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.380]  I have, like, apparently like my uncle invented it.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.700]  I'm somehow related to the person that invented that in some way.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.020]  What is happening?
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.100]  What?
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.080]  They're not, I don't think they're my uncle, but they're definitely in the family tree somewhere.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.560]  Well, this is...
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:18.860]  What?
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.000]  Second cousin?
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.940]  End this. End this. What is happening?
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.160]  We got a cliffhanger now.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.560]  Hey, audience, would you... oh, I see. Pink, yellow, green, and orange.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.860]  What is your favorite color?
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.120]  I love orange.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.760]  I like orange too, but I have an association with orange.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.420]  It always makes me feel like I'm picking it because of that.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.180]  I like green's not bad.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.520]  Ah, there's no wrong color when it comes to a fuckstick.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:43.940]  No.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.420]  Thanks for listening.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.120]  I think we should wait until we can get white.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.460]  I just...
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.000]  They're expensive.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.980]  Yeah, and I like the orange one.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.440]  What do you have against orange?
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.360]  Nothing.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.940]  It sounds like something.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.740]  It's weird to see a color come through the logo. I think that's what's weirding me out.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.140]  Is it?
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.200]  It's weird to see a fuckface that's colored in.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:02.880]  Huh.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.180]  Bye.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.540]  Well, we'll talk to you guys later. And Gavin, next week, I want to get into why you were in
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.880]  such a bad mood in this podcast. Talk to you later.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.400]  Was it? What do you mean?
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.180]  Hey, guys. Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Fuckface.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.780]  Andrew talks old school achievement guides.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.380]  Gavin destroys everything with an Apple remote.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.900]  The boys talk about killing Betty White and doom Tom Hanks in the process.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.680]  Chef celebrates Zim Day.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.920]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.260]  All that and more on the next episode of Fuckface.
