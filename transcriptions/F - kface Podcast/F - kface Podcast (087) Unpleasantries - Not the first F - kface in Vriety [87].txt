[00:00.000 --> 00:03.140]  Was one of your resolutions this year to order less takeout?
[00:03.660 --> 00:06.480]  HelloFresh sends everything you need to get dinner on the table.

[00:30.970 --> 00:36.250]  I had a realization earlier today and it has only been confirmed further by today.
[00:36.450 --> 00:36.770]  Okay.
[00:37.130 --> 00:38.990]  I was thinking about it. I was laying down.
[00:38.990 --> 00:42.390]  I woke up this morning. I thought, you know what? This is a weird thing to wake up to.
[00:42.550 --> 00:43.190]  Can I ask you a question?
[00:43.530 --> 00:43.830]  Yeah.
[00:44.030 --> 00:46.070]  You said you were thinking about that you were laying down.
[00:46.490 --> 00:50.550]  Are you still in bed at this point or have you started your day and then gone back to bed?
[00:50.910 --> 00:53.530]  No, no. It was when I woke up. It was when I first woke up.
[00:53.590 --> 00:55.990]  Okay. Through the slats of the...
[00:56.750 --> 01:01.630]  I fixed the bed. I fixed the bed. I have actually a thing related to that to talk about today.
[01:01.950 --> 01:05.390]  But fixed the bed, waking up, thinking about recording, very excited.
[01:05.390 --> 01:09.710]  And then I thought about Gavin and that you always show up on time.
[01:09.850 --> 01:12.030]  I think Gavin hates pleasantries.
[01:12.490 --> 01:12.590]  Yeah.
[01:12.730 --> 01:16.450]  I think there's nobody that hates pleasantries more than Gavin.
[01:16.830 --> 01:20.730]  And I don't think you realize how much joy you're missing in your life
[01:20.730 --> 01:24.650]  by opting out of pleasantries in what it seems to be every scenario.
[01:25.210 --> 01:27.450]  Name a memorable pleasantry experience.
[01:27.550 --> 01:32.310]  I literally just today talked... I spent 15 minutes talking with Nick,
[01:32.310 --> 01:33.730]  maybe not 15, like five,
[01:34.030 --> 01:37.530]  talking with Nick about things I never knew about him that were super interesting.
[01:37.590 --> 01:38.550]  That's not pleasantries. That's pleasantries.
[01:38.550 --> 01:39.390]  That is pleasantries.
[01:39.970 --> 01:40.990]  No, it's pleasantries.
[01:41.370 --> 01:42.230]  That's pleasantries.
[01:42.490 --> 01:43.730]  Hey, how's it going? Oh, you go.
[01:44.010 --> 01:47.030]  No, Gavin, pleasantries is before we record,
[01:47.350 --> 01:49.450]  me being able to say to you, how's your day going?
[01:49.510 --> 01:52.910]  And just having a little bit of a talk instead of you showing up and immediately recording.
[01:53.210 --> 01:54.250]  There's no room for pleasantries.
[01:54.710 --> 01:57.230]  The pleasantries led into a genuine conversation.
[01:57.850 --> 01:59.710]  Which is what's great about pleasantries.
[02:00.010 --> 02:02.230]  You don't... you're talking about a thing you don't know about.
[02:02.230 --> 02:03.750]  It's true about that.
[02:04.190 --> 02:06.690]  Pleasantries can lead into a world of entertainment,
[02:06.850 --> 02:08.570]  including an inspiring conversation.
[02:08.690 --> 02:10.110]  That's the beauty of the pleasantry.
[02:10.390 --> 02:14.670]  I also experienced a wonderful conversation of pleasantries this morning,
[02:15.170 --> 02:17.850]  talking to Geoff Yetter and Alan and a bunch of people from work
[02:17.850 --> 02:19.830]  while I was waiting for an executive meeting to start.
[02:21.730 --> 02:23.970]  I'm laser focused with Andrew on this one.
[02:24.430 --> 02:26.670]  I think you need to adopt...
[02:26.670 --> 02:29.090]  Like, I don't know if you had a bad pleasantry experience.
[02:29.270 --> 02:30.930]  I don't know where this started for you.
[02:30.930 --> 02:32.060]  I don't know if you've always been...
[02:32.850 --> 02:33.890]  You had unpleasantries!
[02:35.610 --> 02:38.570]  But okay, I know I've known both of you for many years
[02:38.570 --> 02:41.430]  and we've had many, many pleasantries.
[02:42.270 --> 02:43.690]  No, no, we haven't.
[02:43.730 --> 02:46.330]  I haven't had a single pleasantry with you on this show.
[02:47.230 --> 02:48.390]  Not a single one.
[02:48.450 --> 02:51.910]  Every time we play Halo, there's like five minutes before we start playing.
[02:52.510 --> 02:56.630]  No, that is insane for you to think that Halo is a time for pleasantries.
[02:56.910 --> 02:57.310]  Is it not?
[02:57.310 --> 02:58.190]  That's ridiculous.
[02:58.530 --> 02:59.890]  That's just a social outing.
[03:01.110 --> 03:03.530]  Pleasantries is the thing before you do the thing.
[03:04.110 --> 03:05.830]  It's before we play the game.
[03:06.150 --> 03:06.970]  I think Andrew's right.
[03:07.090 --> 03:10.210]  God, I hate to pile on, Gavin, but I gotta think Andrew's right.
[03:10.530 --> 03:14.130]  I would go even further and I would say that I, in my experience,
[03:14.170 --> 03:17.510]  because I recently, I think last weekend, I caught a game,
[03:17.650 --> 03:20.130]  a couple games of Halo with you guys and our friend Trevor,
[03:20.430 --> 03:23.750]  and I quickly was reminded that I'm incapable
[03:24.230 --> 03:27.330]  of having any level of conversation with either of you
[03:27.330 --> 03:29.750]  without it turning into a podcast or content.
[03:30.330 --> 03:30.750]  Really?
[03:34.290 --> 03:36.690]  Within two minutes, I was in podcast mode.
[03:37.010 --> 03:38.570]  So I don't think pleasantries are possible
[03:38.570 --> 03:42.650]  because the second our mouths open, in my estimation, it turns into content.
[03:42.770 --> 03:45.870]  Well, okay, I might be, maybe I just don't know
[03:46.530 --> 03:48.470]  where the line is drawn at pleasantries.
[03:48.570 --> 03:51.610]  So for example, Andrew, why don't you have some pleasantries with me right now?
[03:52.190 --> 03:55.090]  I can't have pleasantries. You can't have pleasantries while we're...
[03:55.090 --> 03:56.630]  Pleasantries are not for recording.
[03:57.150 --> 03:59.270]  Pleasantries are like a little, hey, how's it going?
[03:59.270 --> 04:01.090]  How's your day? It's a warm up.
[04:01.170 --> 04:02.070]  I imagine we weren't recording.
[04:02.310 --> 04:04.910]  I imagine we weren't recording. Okay, now...
[04:04.910 --> 04:05.530]  Door, door creak.
[04:06.110 --> 04:08.110]  You can't force pleasantries.
[04:08.350 --> 04:12.410]  All right, I think that's a little extreme, Andrew.
[04:12.590 --> 04:15.110]  I think you can play pretend pleasantries.
[04:15.430 --> 04:16.190]  No, because here's the thing.
[04:17.010 --> 04:19.170]  Yes, and Andrew. Yes, and.
[04:19.590 --> 04:22.150]  I disagree strongly because if we do pleasantry thing,
[04:22.210 --> 04:23.830]  we're going to fall right into his hand, Geoff,
[04:23.830 --> 04:25.270]  and it's going to be boring as fuck.
[04:25.370 --> 04:26.770]  And it's not going to work at all.
[04:26.770 --> 04:30.110]  We're going to just feel anxious that we're eating up showtime.
[04:30.110 --> 04:31.050]  Why don't we...
[04:31.050 --> 04:31.470]  Bullshit pleasantries.
[04:31.470 --> 04:32.530]  Why don't we then...
[04:32.530 --> 04:33.370]  Why don't...
[04:33.370 --> 04:34.430]  Hey Gavin, I got a fucking...
[04:34.430 --> 04:37.710]  The crack on with episode 87 of F*** Face.
[04:37.830 --> 04:39.970]  I'm Gavin, that's Geoff, and you're Andrew.
[04:39.970 --> 04:40.450]  Andrew.
[04:40.910 --> 04:41.950]  That's very high energy.
[04:42.730 --> 04:43.990]  Skip the pleasantries.
[04:44.710 --> 04:45.310]  Next week.
[04:46.170 --> 04:46.890]  Next week.
[04:46.950 --> 04:47.450]  10 minutes.
[04:47.590 --> 04:48.550]  Show up 10 minutes early.
[04:48.670 --> 04:49.230]  Try the pleasantries.
[04:49.310 --> 04:50.030]  Just try it.
[04:50.350 --> 04:50.830]  Evaluate.
[04:50.910 --> 04:53.430]  I deliberately stay after we record every week.
[04:53.530 --> 04:55.230]  Geoff has to piss off the second we stop.
[04:55.230 --> 04:58.690]  I stay for end pleasantries every week.
[04:58.910 --> 05:00.250]  But nobody needs the unpleasantries.
[05:00.570 --> 05:02.290]  Oh, you don't want my pleasantries at the end?
[05:02.430 --> 05:03.230]  No, they're great.
[05:03.270 --> 05:04.350]  I don't have to leave.
[05:04.430 --> 05:06.970]  I leave to get away from having pleasantries at the end.
[05:07.370 --> 05:09.710]  I thought you have to, like, frequently get Millie from stuff.
[05:10.390 --> 05:11.530]  Yeah, a lot of times I do.
[05:11.590 --> 05:12.750]  A lot of times I'm racing to get Millie.
[05:12.850 --> 05:15.670]  But a lot of other times I just am done talking to you guys.
[05:17.830 --> 05:18.470]  That's fair.
[05:19.290 --> 05:21.530]  You know, I understand that completely.
[05:21.790 --> 05:22.970]  Yeah, this is completely valid.
[05:22.970 --> 05:24.790]  I wouldn't want to be around me for more than an hour.
[05:25.470 --> 05:28.790]  I had to live with you off and on for a decade. I've had a lot of you.
[05:28.970 --> 05:29.930]  Oh, I wasn't so bad.
[05:30.270 --> 05:30.590]  Surely.
[05:31.190 --> 05:32.390]  He threw a stick at you.
[05:32.510 --> 05:35.650]  I'd say you're pretty bad to live with based off of that information.
[05:35.670 --> 05:40.730]  Dude, it was one of the great joys of my life was every opportunity I had to be with you.
[05:41.790 --> 05:43.710]  And I say that without hyperbole.
[05:44.070 --> 05:45.490]  Or full of hyperbole.
[05:46.670 --> 05:48.910]  A full stick's worth of hyperbole.
[05:49.450 --> 05:52.290]  Geoff, you once told me, you just out of nowhere said,
[05:53.030 --> 05:54.950]  you're very easy to live with.
[05:55.230 --> 05:56.430]  And I thought you were taking the piss.
[05:56.570 --> 06:00.090]  I thought you're going to be like, here's a list of annoying shit that I do.
[06:00.170 --> 06:01.570]  But it was like a genuine comment.
[06:01.670 --> 06:03.390]  I was like, damn, wow, thanks.
[06:04.110 --> 06:05.550]  I'm going to tell you something right now.
[06:05.870 --> 06:06.230]  Yeah, I do.
[06:06.430 --> 06:07.990]  I'm going to tell you something about you right now.
[06:08.510 --> 06:13.510]  You are easy to everything with in my experience.
[06:13.850 --> 06:15.670]  And I mean, that is a tremendous compliment.
[06:16.010 --> 06:17.230]  You are easy to travel with.
[06:17.330 --> 06:18.670]  You are easy to live with.
[06:18.750 --> 06:20.750]  You are easy to commute with.
[06:20.770 --> 06:22.150]  You are easy to play video games with.
[06:22.150 --> 06:24.250]  Have a lifelong friendship with.
[06:24.390 --> 06:29.410]  You're easy to do all of the one area you are not easy to blank with is schedule.
[06:29.850 --> 06:31.310]  You are impossible to manage.
[06:31.310 --> 06:32.830]  This is what I tell people all the time.
[06:33.070 --> 06:36.630]  Everyone's like, oh, you know, your reputation.
[06:36.810 --> 06:39.450]  And I'm telling you, if I had one job, I would be...
[06:40.410 --> 06:43.190]  I think I would genuinely be a nice person to interact with.
[06:46.030 --> 06:49.310]  But unfortunately, I've got a lot going on all the time.
[06:49.310 --> 06:53.110]  Yes, I don't mean it in that, like, you're a piece of shit and you're hard to nail down.
[06:53.330 --> 06:57.990]  I mean, you're a busy lad and you've got a million fingers and a million pies
[06:57.990 --> 07:02.790]  and you're constantly in motion and it's just hard to nail you down a lot.
[07:03.350 --> 07:04.890]  I'll take that. That's a nice compliment.
[07:05.370 --> 07:05.530]  Yeah.
[07:05.910 --> 07:07.230]  I would say that was very pleasant.
[07:07.810 --> 07:10.970]  That was quite a lot of pleasantries that just occurred.
[07:11.590 --> 07:13.150]  No, that was a conversation.
[07:14.550 --> 07:16.950]  Yeah. Show up 10 minutes early, you'll get it.
[07:16.950 --> 07:19.610]  You'll get it. It's like a secret door.
[07:19.750 --> 07:21.530]  You got to, like, run through the thing and hog it.
[07:21.930 --> 07:25.470]  The last time you frickin' made it, the last time I showed up 10 minutes early,
[07:25.670 --> 07:27.810]  you shat on me for being early for 10 minutes.
[07:28.790 --> 07:30.630]  That's true. That's my fault.
[07:30.850 --> 07:34.470]  And I've only further decreased your interest in pleasantries.
[07:34.550 --> 07:35.570]  I'll own that. I apologize.
[07:36.150 --> 07:38.190]  But I didn't have the perspective I have now.
[07:38.250 --> 07:39.250]  I realize you don't get it.
[07:39.370 --> 07:41.610]  You don't... there's a whole world of pleasantries you're missing.
[07:42.150 --> 07:46.030]  You would have loved to hear the things I heard of the pleasantries before this show.
[07:46.030 --> 07:46.930]  What did we miss?
[07:47.470 --> 07:48.590]  Well, it's not mine to share.
[07:48.710 --> 07:50.290]  It's not my information, so I'm not going to say it.
[07:50.310 --> 07:51.570]  But it was a great conversation.
[07:52.030 --> 07:52.970]  I'm glad. You missed out on it.
[07:53.250 --> 07:56.450]  But you did mention, Geoff, that we played Halo recently.
[07:56.830 --> 07:57.550]  All of us. Yeah.
[07:57.810 --> 08:00.070]  And you're like, you immediately went into podcast mode.
[08:00.130 --> 08:01.630]  And I was like, really? That's interesting.
[08:01.710 --> 08:04.810]  And then and I realized I have a block of content for the show.
[08:05.270 --> 08:06.390]  From that Halo session?
[08:06.530 --> 08:07.390]  Yeah, I learned.
[08:07.710 --> 08:08.850]  Because we were... it was content.
[08:09.050 --> 08:13.350]  I learned something that I didn't realize that Gavin seems very sensitive about.
[08:13.350 --> 08:15.530]  There's there's an accusation.
[08:16.490 --> 08:19.490]  Some some may even say a mystery of sorts.
[08:19.650 --> 08:23.750]  It's not an accusation or a mystery when Gavin provides the proof of his own dirt.
[08:25.990 --> 08:28.510]  One of you would like to... Gavin, why don't you explain?
[08:28.590 --> 08:30.750]  Because I feel like you're you're the center of this.
[08:30.990 --> 08:34.210]  I'll explain the 13 years of bullshit I've been listening to.
[08:34.650 --> 08:36.390]  Yes, please.
[08:36.970 --> 08:40.010]  Back back in the day, Halo 3 came out.
[08:40.010 --> 08:43.470]  It had 1000 gamerscore, as many games did.
[08:44.050 --> 08:47.390]  And it was sort of among the... it was sort of pre-achievement right now.
[08:47.430 --> 08:51.570]  But among the same people, we were very excited to be the first person
[08:51.570 --> 08:53.690]  to complete the entire game's achievements.
[08:54.230 --> 08:58.550]  But it was very easy in matchmaking to fake some of the multiplayer achievements.
[08:58.670 --> 09:00.710]  You just had to convince the lobby to like,
[09:00.790 --> 09:03.470]  hey, two people stand together and I'll laser through you.
[09:03.730 --> 09:05.570]  Because if you get two kills with a laser, that's an achievement.
[09:06.170 --> 09:09.150]  But we were... I feel like we were all going for purity.
[09:09.650 --> 09:11.690]  Me, it was Geoff, it was Bernie at the time.
[09:12.350 --> 09:16.030]  And I feel like we were dead set on getting them legit.
[09:16.250 --> 09:16.930]  Wouldn't you agree, Geoff?
[09:17.070 --> 09:22.410]  Yeah, 100%. And that's what makes this so painful.
[09:22.610 --> 09:24.970]  Yeah, the final two achievements I was after.
[09:25.350 --> 09:27.690]  Step and razor, triple kill with a sword in matchmaking.
[09:27.850 --> 09:29.310]  Pretty difficult at the time, I felt like.
[09:29.570 --> 09:35.310]  And an overkill, which in free-for-all at the time,
[09:35.590 --> 09:37.470]  meant killing everyone else in the game.
[09:37.470 --> 09:39.390]  Because the free-for-all matches were five people.
[09:39.890 --> 09:43.330]  You had to kill everyone within, what, like three or four seconds of each other.
[09:43.810 --> 09:47.490]  I got them all perfectly legitimately, very proud of it.
[09:47.530 --> 09:50.470]  You can tell from the timestamps of the achievements, they're quite far apart.
[09:51.170 --> 09:56.990]  And to this very day, neither Bernie nor Geoff believe me that my overkill was legitimate.
[09:57.570 --> 10:02.770]  So first off, let me hop in here and say that this was not...
[10:02.770 --> 10:06.890]  Gavin is not overselling how difficult this achievement was to get.
[10:06.890 --> 10:11.190]  There have been very few times I've played video games where I was angry enough to
[10:11.190 --> 10:14.090]  physically smash a controller to the point it doesn't work anymore.
[10:14.670 --> 10:18.710]  I lost two controllers in the service of this achievement.
[10:18.870 --> 10:22.230]  It took me about 45 days after Gavin got his.
[10:22.510 --> 10:26.590]  I remember, because I got madder and madder the further away we got,
[10:26.730 --> 10:28.890]  because especially after I realized that he had cheated.
[10:29.610 --> 10:31.930]  And I was still trying to get mine legitimately.
[10:31.930 --> 10:36.750]  And then fucking Bungie on top of that did an extra fuck you to me.
[10:37.750 --> 10:40.510]  I eventually, about 45 days later, I got it.
[10:40.630 --> 10:43.670]  It was one of the greater moments of my life. It was on my third controller.
[10:45.890 --> 10:47.730]  And I was done. I was so happy.
[10:48.170 --> 10:53.010]  Less than like a month later, they upped that game mode to have six people in it.
[10:53.150 --> 10:55.990]  And it became instantly easier to get it.
[10:56.310 --> 10:57.970]  Way, way, way, way, way easier to get it.
[10:58.010 --> 11:00.010]  I think I had to get it on Ratsnest, if memory serves.
[11:00.010 --> 11:01.850]  I can't remember all the map names.
[11:02.570 --> 11:06.150]  But the point is, it was very, very hard to get.
[11:06.490 --> 11:08.950]  And I think part of the reason why it's so frustrating to me,
[11:09.030 --> 11:10.290]  and I know it was so frustrating to Bernie,
[11:10.510 --> 11:12.850]  is how hard it was for us to do it legitimately.
[11:13.250 --> 11:16.850]  For you to just stand three people in a row and kill them.
[11:18.710 --> 11:23.250]  I was very happy to provide video evidence of my achievements.
[11:23.410 --> 11:26.730]  Because at the time, this is before Achievement Hunter existed,
[11:26.730 --> 11:30.370]  at the time, I'd still saved the clips in theater mode
[11:30.370 --> 11:32.590]  of all of the moments I got those achievements.
[11:32.890 --> 11:35.670]  So I thought, I can just go back to these clips,
[11:35.830 --> 11:37.290]  now that Achievement Hunter exists,
[11:37.430 --> 11:40.750]  and make a little achievement guide for achievements that I've already got.
[11:40.830 --> 11:42.650]  I've got all the clips. I've got Step and Razor.
[11:42.690 --> 11:44.730]  I've got the two-for-one laser. I've got Overkill.
[11:44.970 --> 11:46.030]  I put it up as a video.
[11:46.530 --> 11:51.110]  And all I got was utter shit from both of these people.
[11:51.530 --> 11:53.370]  When was the last time you watched this, Geoff?
[11:54.730 --> 11:56.410]  I probably haven't seen it in 10 years.
[11:56.410 --> 11:59.230]  Okay, well, it's just a real clip, or if he's found in it.
[11:59.430 --> 12:00.550]  No, no, this is the real clip.
[12:02.230 --> 12:04.970]  Tell me your feelings on this as you watch this video.
[12:06.090 --> 12:09.510]  You mean that guy that he just hit twice who refused to look at him?
[12:10.010 --> 12:10.930]  Are you already on the Overkill?
[12:11.050 --> 12:14.150]  Uh, yeah, I already watched it.
[12:14.230 --> 12:15.610]  I couldn't play a little while ago.
[12:15.750 --> 12:18.930]  I still see, definitely see you cheating to get this achievement.
[12:19.510 --> 12:23.550]  This is a video from October 5th, 2008, which is, I assume, when I uploaded it.
[12:23.550 --> 12:29.070]  Um, and the first guy, I'll admit, in my Overkill, the first guy just doesn't damage me at all.
[12:29.130 --> 12:31.890]  I don't know if he didn't see me or he's just walking backwards, but I had the hammer.
[12:32.210 --> 12:37.810]  I probably still got the entire game as a theater mode file.
[12:38.410 --> 12:43.650]  I give you the... I think maybe the third kill is legitimate.
[12:45.950 --> 12:47.070]  What do you mean?
[12:48.150 --> 12:49.770]  The rest of them are definitely not.
[12:49.910 --> 12:52.910]  It's definitely... it's okay, man, and everybody was doing it.
[12:52.910 --> 12:55.630]  Why would I give you the video if I cheated?
[12:56.850 --> 12:58.090]  Who? Why would you cheat?
[12:58.370 --> 12:59.470]  I mean, he already saw it.
[12:59.530 --> 13:02.870]  I don't know why that would change anything based off of his previous opinion,
[13:03.030 --> 13:04.890]  but I had never heard of this conflict.
[13:05.070 --> 13:08.410]  This was all new to me, and it was clear Gavin was passionate about it.
[13:08.850 --> 13:13.610]  And Geoff has talked about wanting to do a mystery show of some kind.
[13:13.970 --> 13:15.310]  Right, you want to solve a crime.
[13:15.790 --> 13:22.650]  What better crime and or mystery to potentially try to solve than Gavin's Overkill issue?
[13:22.910 --> 13:26.350]  So I went deep. I did some research. I went digging.
[13:26.950 --> 13:27.490]  Oh, I'm excited.
[13:28.190 --> 13:32.330]  Now, the problem is the video quality is 240p.
[13:32.930 --> 13:34.970]  So when I started to do my research,
[13:35.750 --> 13:40.650]  there's a moment in which Gavin shows a screen of players trying to decipher that.
[13:41.050 --> 13:43.470]  Not easy. It's completely blurred.
[13:43.650 --> 13:45.650]  You can't really make out anybody's names.
[13:45.770 --> 13:47.910]  Oh, are you going to try and contact these people?
[13:48.570 --> 13:49.830]  Oh, feel free, son.
[13:49.830 --> 13:54.950]  And now and Gavin's, this is what helps Gavin is in like February last year,
[13:55.070 --> 13:58.910]  Bungie got rid of all of their old stats that they used to have for Halo on their website.
[13:59.170 --> 14:03.570]  So there's no immediately accessible paper trail to this.
[14:03.670 --> 14:04.690]  It's just impossible.
[14:05.070 --> 14:07.970]  However, Gavin, thankfully, as he mentioned,
[14:08.310 --> 14:11.650]  he recorded these as clips and then put them on his file share.
[14:11.790 --> 14:15.990]  So a clean version of all these exist on Halo 3,
[14:16.210 --> 14:18.350]  but you need to be in Halo 3 to get it.
[14:18.350 --> 14:22.050]  And Halo 3 servers went down, I think, yesterday.
[14:22.630 --> 14:24.070]  It was a whole thing.
[14:24.510 --> 14:28.270]  So like, once again, the timing of this, very convenient for you, Gavin.
[14:28.530 --> 14:32.250]  But I hopped on, I hopped on Twitter and I was like,
[14:32.290 --> 14:34.330]  hey, does anyone happen to have a copy of Halo 3?
[14:34.550 --> 14:37.650]  And somebody was fucking kind enough to do it.
[14:37.830 --> 14:41.130]  They pulled out a copy of Halo 3.
[14:41.330 --> 14:45.310]  They even fucking had to pull out a 360.
[14:45.770 --> 14:47.710]  They had like four console updates.
[14:47.710 --> 14:49.090]  They had to go through.
[14:49.550 --> 14:52.890]  Matt King was the kind enough person to be the other.
[14:53.370 --> 14:55.630]  Thank you, Matt King, for doing this detective work for us.
[14:55.930 --> 14:57.450]  So he booted up his 360.
[14:57.770 --> 14:59.850]  He got everything I needed.
[14:59.930 --> 15:02.530]  So these are the screenshots I got from Matt King
[15:02.530 --> 15:07.190]  of all the different player names in the lobby that Gavin interacted with.
[15:07.270 --> 15:07.910]  Much clearer.
[15:08.090 --> 15:09.150]  I can do research.
[15:09.390 --> 15:10.110]  So I went on.
[15:10.170 --> 15:11.490]  I went on to investigate.
[15:11.730 --> 15:12.190]  Wait, wait, wait.
[15:12.350 --> 15:13.850]  You don't need to investigate any further.
[15:14.010 --> 15:16.050]  You just need to free cam that clip.
[15:16.550 --> 15:16.950]  What do you mean?
[15:16.950 --> 15:19.590]  Are you saying you pulled the mode clip?
[15:19.970 --> 15:20.710]  No, he did.
[15:21.650 --> 15:28.310]  So he could have just free cammed the map and watched everyone else fight without me.
[15:28.490 --> 15:29.430]  Well, that already exists.
[15:29.550 --> 15:31.570]  There are moments of that, but that doesn't necessarily...
[15:31.570 --> 15:33.990]  I mean, that's a great argument against it being legitimate.
[15:34.150 --> 15:37.290]  There's moments within the clip itself in which there is a fight
[15:37.290 --> 15:39.530]  unrelated to Gavin before he has the hammer.
[15:40.970 --> 15:44.490]  What was great is I didn't intend for this to fuck with Gavin.
[15:44.650 --> 15:46.890]  Gavin got this achievement on the 18th of October.
[15:46.890 --> 15:47.650]  2007.
[15:48.450 --> 15:50.930]  And so I randomly last night texted Gavin.
[15:51.110 --> 15:54.670]  What were you doing the night of eight on the 18th of October, 2007?
[15:54.950 --> 15:57.270]  And he was very confused in a way that he felt like.
[15:57.350 --> 15:58.990]  He felt like you thought I was fucking with you.
[15:59.290 --> 16:00.170]  I said, I don't know.
[16:00.230 --> 16:01.710]  But the day before I went bowling.
[16:04.910 --> 16:05.950]  Confirmation on bowling.
[16:06.150 --> 16:09.230]  And he had a photo of a pen up his nose from three days later.
[16:09.230 --> 16:10.670]  So a definite criminal.
[16:10.790 --> 16:12.610]  Yeah. Do you have a post it?
[16:12.750 --> 16:14.710]  I don't have it immediately on hand.
[16:14.710 --> 16:16.650]  But if I could.
[16:17.110 --> 16:17.410]  Anyway.
[16:18.610 --> 16:19.830]  I looked into these people.
[16:19.930 --> 16:20.650]  I have a question for you.
[16:20.750 --> 16:23.410]  So were you in England at the time?
[16:23.750 --> 16:23.850]  Yeah.
[16:24.690 --> 16:25.610]  That makes sense.
[16:25.630 --> 16:28.170]  Because one of the people I looked up, Raycon79.
[16:29.430 --> 16:31.370]  This is their profile, their bio.
[16:31.490 --> 16:32.810]  Maybe you can make sense of it to me.
[16:32.890 --> 16:33.770]  I don't understand it.
[16:33.830 --> 16:34.530]  Maybe we'll edit it out.
[16:35.110 --> 16:36.190]  This is what his bio was.
[16:36.650 --> 16:38.730]  If your ma'am's a Arsenal fan.
[16:38.910 --> 16:40.830]  If your ma'am's an Arsenal fan.
[16:40.830 --> 16:45.250]  Then she should go to Hapfrey Market and buy a bag of Cyprus spuds.
[16:48.720 --> 16:51.460]  Like all that confirmed to me is that they were also in England.
[16:51.980 --> 16:53.440]  There's one of my people right there.
[16:53.720 --> 16:54.460]  That's one of your people.
[16:54.460 --> 16:55.160]  Is that an insult?
[16:55.980 --> 16:56.820]  I don't know.
[16:56.980 --> 16:57.260]  I didn't know.
[16:57.380 --> 16:59.180]  Is that pro Arsenal or anti Arsenal?
[16:59.540 --> 17:00.560]  I don't know.
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.400]  What are the spuds?
[17:02.640 --> 17:05.060]  Is there a significance to Cyprus spuds, Gavin?
[17:05.540 --> 17:06.560]  You don't know what a spud is?
[17:07.080 --> 17:08.140]  Well, no, I know what a spud is.
[17:08.360 --> 17:08.520]  I know.
[17:08.740 --> 17:10.520]  But what is a Cyprus spud?
[17:10.980 --> 17:11.340]  Don't know.
[17:11.340 --> 17:12.880]  You don't know.
[17:13.300 --> 17:14.780]  Okay, so that's just...
[17:14.780 --> 17:17.200]  Well, don't don't British people retire to Cyprus a lot?
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.200]  Isn't that like a big retirement?
[17:18.780 --> 17:20.460]  Yeah, it's a popular location.
[17:22.480 --> 17:22.960]  So...
[17:23.760 --> 17:25.300]  That's a picture of a cheater.
[17:26.060 --> 17:27.600]  Two days after Miami killed you.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.240]  That's not the face of a Chia.
[17:30.220 --> 17:31.700]  So I looked in all these people.
[17:32.220 --> 17:36.800]  Sadly, and because I'd love for this to be like undeniable, Gavin is guilty.
[17:37.340 --> 17:39.660]  Sadly, most of these people...
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.680]  No, I'd rather it be guilty.
[17:41.820 --> 17:43.260]  I think it'd be funnier if I was able to confirm.
[17:43.320 --> 17:43.720]  Yeah, me too.
[17:45.140 --> 17:46.380]  But all of these people...
[17:47.460 --> 17:48.640]  None of them got the achievement.
[17:48.900 --> 17:49.940]  They didn't get it on that day.
[17:49.980 --> 17:51.020]  They never got it at all.
[17:51.380 --> 17:54.900]  We can now belittle Gavin's achievement though,
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.160]  because most of them have only played Halo for like one day.
[17:58.640 --> 18:00.820]  These are all people that had no idea what they were doing.
[18:00.940 --> 18:02.980]  That explains the behavior in the game.
[18:03.140 --> 18:03.760]  I got lucky.
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.220]  No, it doesn't.
[18:04.660 --> 18:05.020]  What?
[18:06.080 --> 18:07.920]  What it explains to me is Gavin said,
[18:07.920 --> 18:12.640]  he messaged some people because he was a member of the Roosteeth community at this point.
[18:12.840 --> 18:13.840]  There were a lot of people out there.
[18:14.100 --> 18:17.960]  We were amongst a lot of gamers of our ilk.
[18:18.300 --> 18:19.860]  I think he probably turned to a couple people and said,
[18:19.960 --> 18:22.580]  hey, would you guys mind hopping on and helping me get this achievement real fast?
[18:22.800 --> 18:25.760]  All you guys got to do is just let me kill you once with this hammer real quick
[18:25.760 --> 18:27.940]  and then we'll just have fun playing Halo together.
[18:28.600 --> 18:30.080]  I don't think that's likely.
[18:30.260 --> 18:33.640]  I think it's more likely that these people just didn't know what they were doing.
[18:33.640 --> 18:35.600]  Andrew, I think you've done tremendous work here.
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.220]  Well, I'm not quite...
[18:37.220 --> 18:40.040]  As I said, Bungie got rid of all their stats.
[18:40.200 --> 18:43.600]  There's a community initiative going on where they've pulled all the data from that
[18:43.600 --> 18:46.720]  and they're working on uploading it as an independent thing.
[18:47.200 --> 18:50.120]  And it sounded like that might be available by the end of this month.
[18:50.620 --> 18:54.640]  So I'm hoping to have the game logs because I was able to look into all these people.
[18:55.180 --> 19:00.660]  However, the most damaging thing about this is by far the most suspicious of the kills
[19:00.660 --> 19:02.620]  is Soul Eater, your first one,
[19:02.840 --> 19:06.780]  where he looks at you and then just does nothing and turns back the other way.
[19:07.220 --> 19:09.260]  He does not exist on Xbox.
[19:09.680 --> 19:11.360]  I don't know who this person is.
[19:11.740 --> 19:14.000]  I reached out to Major Nelson on Twitter about it.
[19:14.080 --> 19:14.660]  No reply.
[19:14.860 --> 19:17.480]  Wasn't able to get clarification for a question I had.
[19:17.760 --> 19:18.760]  That's OK, busy man.
[19:19.220 --> 19:20.840]  But he doesn't exist.
[19:21.260 --> 19:22.160]  And that's really...
[19:22.160 --> 19:25.500]  Like, if you wanted anyone to clear your name, it is Soul Eater.
[19:26.160 --> 19:31.280]  But the one account that is Soul Eater on Xbox has only played Phantasy Star Online.
[19:31.480 --> 19:32.480]  So it's a different account.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.860]  So either Soul Eater was suspended or...
[19:35.860 --> 19:38.180]  I think more likely they changed their game.
[19:38.320 --> 19:40.920]  Could be cheating. Can't rule that out.
[19:41.500 --> 19:44.900]  That's why I was trying to get in contact with Major Nelson to find the backstory of Soul Eater.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.080]  I also love that in the photo of Soul Eater, you can see the guy's reflection.
[19:48.580 --> 19:49.560]  But like, you can't make an idea.
[19:49.620 --> 19:51.760]  It adds to the mystery of who Soul Eater is.
[19:52.200 --> 19:54.740]  I spent so much time trying to track that guy down.
[19:54.880 --> 19:57.180]  I do think that that first kill is pretty suspect.
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.440]  Also, the last kill, when Gavin swings a sword or swings the hammer at the guy,
[20:01.500 --> 20:03.560]  the guy looks at Gavin and then looks to the left
[20:03.560 --> 20:05.180]  and then lets Gavin kill him again.
[20:05.220 --> 20:06.440]  It's pretty fucking suspect.
[20:07.020 --> 20:07.960]  There are some definite things.
[20:07.960 --> 20:08.620]  I'm watching this again.
[20:08.800 --> 20:09.340]  The first guy...
[20:11.240 --> 20:13.040]  It's like there's a massive fight going on.
[20:13.140 --> 20:14.560]  There's no way this would be...
[20:14.560 --> 20:15.200]  Yeah, smack.
[20:16.860 --> 20:17.840]  Okay, I'm in a bubble.
[20:17.980 --> 20:18.880]  Oh, so this isn't the spree.
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.920]  I've put a bit of head on this, apparently.
[20:21.020 --> 20:22.020]  There is a little bit of head on.
[20:22.300 --> 20:23.640]  Yeah, that guy is just not doing anything.
[20:23.980 --> 20:24.720]  No, he's useless.
[20:24.920 --> 20:25.700]  Like, he doesn't...
[20:25.700 --> 20:27.620]  It's the most suspicious, as I said, of all of them.
[20:27.720 --> 20:30.080]  Well, Gavin only needed him to have that account for one day.
[20:30.740 --> 20:31.740]  That is true.
[20:31.740 --> 20:34.820]  Most of the accounts feel like they only existed for one day.
[20:35.280 --> 20:38.760]  The only one that had any history on it was the
[20:38.760 --> 20:40.840]  your mam's in Arsenal fan guy.
[20:41.060 --> 20:44.500]  I messaged several people on his friends list if they have any memory of them
[20:44.500 --> 20:46.040]  and I didn't get a reply back from anybody.
[20:46.380 --> 20:47.000]  I tried.
[20:47.160 --> 20:50.920]  I did a thorough investigation, or at least as thorough as I could get.
[20:51.320 --> 20:55.720]  I think there's a really, really good chance that at least a couple of these accounts are Gavin.
[20:56.060 --> 20:56.740]  You think so?
[20:56.980 --> 20:57.200]  You think?
[20:57.400 --> 20:57.760]  Yeah.
[20:57.960 --> 20:59.920]  Gavin had a ton of accounts back in the day.
[20:59.920 --> 21:03.480]  He had a big thing about, like, tricking people into changing their gamertags.
[21:03.600 --> 21:07.360]  He was hyper-obsessed with gamertags and accounts back then.
[21:07.760 --> 21:08.860]  I've had, in my life...
[21:08.860 --> 21:10.940]  He had a US account, a British account, two gamertags.
[21:11.080 --> 21:12.240]  Well, that you cop up to.
[21:12.600 --> 21:12.980]  Yeah.
[21:13.120 --> 21:13.660]  That's true.
[21:13.700 --> 21:15.300]  That you acknowledge as yours, of course.
[21:15.420 --> 21:16.440]  That you said are yours.
[21:17.120 --> 21:17.900]  I will say this.
[21:18.060 --> 21:21.040]  The person that helped on Twitter pull this all together,
[21:21.360 --> 21:23.900]  they thought you were undeniably guilty of staging this based off of...
[21:23.900 --> 21:24.560]  Oh my god!
[21:25.420 --> 21:27.040]  Frickin' fly around the map, dude!
[21:27.460 --> 21:28.020]  Fly around!
[21:28.100 --> 21:28.780]  Everyone's fighting!
[21:30.640 --> 21:32.080]  They felt very strongly.
[21:32.440 --> 21:33.040]  So I don't know.
[21:33.100 --> 21:34.120]  I think it could be interesting.
[21:34.240 --> 21:34.960]  The people can watch.
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.880]  It is in a video that I linked.
[21:37.340 --> 21:38.920]  I'm sure there will be some way.
[21:39.320 --> 21:40.140]  Maybe you should just read.
[21:40.560 --> 21:41.960]  It's on the site, too, but it's not...
[21:41.960 --> 21:43.100]  The video quality isn't any different.
[21:43.260 --> 21:46.780]  It's Halo 3, Overkill, Step and Razor, 2 for 1,
[21:46.860 --> 21:48.400]  Mongoose Modem Guide, Rooster Teeth.
[21:48.500 --> 21:49.100]  You can find it.
[21:49.100 --> 21:50.420]  What happened to that file, by the way?
[21:50.900 --> 21:51.260]  240p?
[21:51.540 --> 21:53.260]  How did I capture it so low?
[21:53.580 --> 21:54.500]  I don't know.
[21:54.580 --> 21:56.560]  It's not like HD wasn't already around.
[21:56.920 --> 21:58.560]  That must have been captured in at least 720.
[21:59.120 --> 21:59.820]  I would say so.
[21:59.920 --> 22:01.480]  There you have it, F*** Face.
[22:01.620 --> 22:02.700]  And there you have it, audience.
[22:03.420 --> 22:04.660]  This is our first.
[22:04.740 --> 22:09.100]  And then, Nick, if you could cut in some law and order or mystery type music right here.
[22:09.780 --> 22:10.580]  First mystery!
[22:11.020 --> 22:12.780]  F*** Face is going to solve the mystery.
[22:12.920 --> 22:16.680]  Hopefully, with the help of the comment leavers and the regulation listeners.
[22:17.040 --> 22:21.040]  Is Gavin the cheat that we all suspect he is?
[22:21.140 --> 22:22.260]  Let's get to the bottom of it.
[22:23.400 --> 22:23.800]  Okay.
[22:24.020 --> 22:25.680]  Now we have our 2022 mystery.
[22:26.020 --> 22:27.100]  This is our first true crime?
[22:27.880 --> 22:28.400]  This is our first.
[22:28.400 --> 22:28.860]  Yeah, this is our first.
[22:28.860 --> 22:34.860]  I guess it'd be the murder of Gavin's honesty and character.
[22:35.080 --> 22:35.120]  Okay.
[22:35.340 --> 22:35.500]  Yes.
[22:36.060 --> 22:38.940]  I would say not guilty based on my investigation,
[22:39.220 --> 22:43.400]  but maybe people can go out with the information shared and find stuff I didn't find.
[22:43.860 --> 22:48.160]  I fully, fully condone delving in as deep as possible to this clip.
[22:49.280 --> 22:51.500]  The truth will be clear.
[22:55.340 --> 22:57.600]  As clear as 240p can be, yeah.
[22:59.760 --> 23:03.120]  You did a great job, Andrew.
[23:03.900 --> 23:06.100]  Unfortunately, the results are inconclusive.
[23:06.500 --> 23:07.860]  You end up...
[23:07.860 --> 23:10.600]  And there's the problem, I think, with...
[23:11.100 --> 23:12.720]  Well, I mean, it's just strength and a weakness, right?
[23:12.720 --> 23:17.700]  I think you tend to see the good in people, which is a great human quality.
[23:17.800 --> 23:20.660]  But as an investigator, it can cloud judgment.
[23:21.200 --> 23:21.460]  I really...
[23:21.460 --> 23:25.220]  The person that you involved in it was convinced Gavin cheated.
[23:25.380 --> 23:26.620]  I am convinced Gavin cheated.
[23:26.620 --> 23:31.560]  Basically, everyone that's known Gavin for most of his life is convinced he cheated.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.220]  Take that for what it's worth.
[23:33.440 --> 23:37.720]  But maybe the audience can help us elucidate this matter.
[23:38.080 --> 23:38.600]  That would be great.
[23:38.920 --> 23:40.540]  Any additional information would be awesome.
[23:40.660 --> 23:42.420]  I hope those things get posted at the end of the month,
[23:42.480 --> 23:44.880]  so I could go in and look at specifically the stats,
[23:44.940 --> 23:47.700]  because I feel like that could also be a big indicator of things.
[23:48.040 --> 23:49.640]  But here's what we need.
[23:49.900 --> 23:50.520]  Here's what we need.
[23:50.640 --> 23:54.260]  You know how we have the phenomenal Vancouver Child Kicker poster
[23:54.260 --> 23:57.600]  that you can put up with information about the Vancouver Child Kicker,
[23:57.680 --> 23:58.460]  if you can contact us?
[23:58.720 --> 24:02.360]  We need a Did Gavin Cheat banner that people can put up,
[24:02.440 --> 24:05.060]  like a poster, a flyer people can put up at coffee shops.
[24:05.160 --> 24:11.540]  If you have information on Gavin, whether he cheated or not in this Halo game,
[24:11.740 --> 24:15.200]  can you email bits at ****facepod.com or whatever it is.
[24:15.280 --> 24:16.340]  I don't even know what our email address is.
[24:16.540 --> 24:21.740]  I want just a billboard of the names when Gavin shows the lobby of his thing,
[24:21.740 --> 24:25.060]  that 240p pixel-y thing on a giant billboard,
[24:25.420 --> 24:30.160]  just people complaining, it making no sense, no context, no information,
[24:30.360 --> 24:32.160]  just the worst billboard ever made.
[24:33.480 --> 24:36.120]  None of 240p billboards out there.
[24:39.260 --> 24:41.640]  I swear it wasn't 240p originally.
[24:41.840 --> 24:44.080]  I think YouTube's like, shat the bed on that video.
[24:46.020 --> 24:50.120]  It was, like the base file, as you said, I think Halo 3 was 720p.
[24:50.120 --> 24:52.520]  So I think somehow in the transferring process.
[24:53.240 --> 24:56.560]  And Gavin was so ahead of the game in tech back then too,
[24:56.640 --> 24:58.720]  that the only way that video could be 240p,
[24:58.740 --> 25:00.720]  if he knew that that was the only way that he could
[25:01.260 --> 25:05.660]  adequately obscure the gamer tags, so that no further investigation could be done.
[25:11.020 --> 25:15.240]  90% of coffee from the grocery store is actually stale.
[25:15.500 --> 25:16.500]  You heard that right.
[25:16.620 --> 25:19.360]  And Eric knows this because he is a coffee snob.
[25:19.460 --> 25:23.240]  The coffee you know and think you love, it needs an upgrade.
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.120]  Instead of rebuying the same old, lame old,
[25:27.440 --> 25:33.120]  let Trade Coffee send you something freshly roasted that you're literally guaranteed to love.
[25:33.740 --> 25:36.920]  They had me say literally in the ad copy, so they must really mean it.
[25:37.260 --> 25:38.180]  How do you take your coffee?
[25:38.560 --> 25:40.360]  Do you like a full-bodied roast?
[25:40.480 --> 25:41.480]  Do you like something light?
[25:41.560 --> 25:42.700]  I'm a medium roast myself.
[25:43.220 --> 25:44.360]  We all have our preferences.
[25:44.620 --> 25:46.360]  And no matter what you love to drink,
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.100]  Trade Coffee makes it easy to brew your best cup at home.
[25:50.100 --> 25:55.800]  They sell the freshest roasted and ethically sourced beans from America's best independent
[25:55.800 --> 25:56.160]  roasters.
[25:56.640 --> 26:00.280]  They ship free to you as often as you like, whole or ground.
[26:00.940 --> 26:03.940]  I went through a phase where I only wanted to grind my beans,
[26:04.440 --> 26:07.020]  and so I would get everything in whole and then grind it myself.
[26:07.320 --> 26:11.120]  And I'll be honest, after a while I got kind of lazy and I've switched back to ground.
[26:11.400 --> 26:13.440]  Yeah, I like, I don't know, it's fine.
[26:13.600 --> 26:15.740]  I decided I don't have to, I don't want to do the work anymore.
[26:16.380 --> 26:21.660]  Thank God there's the ground option for those of us who can't be bothered to grind another
[26:21.660 --> 26:22.440]  bean themselves.
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.760]  So whether you're a coffee nerd, aka Eric, or you just want a better daily cup, Geoff,
[26:28.300 --> 26:33.480]  Trade's real coffee experts taste test over 400 roasts and use technology to match you
[26:33.480 --> 26:36.860]  to your ideal coffee based on your preferences and brewing method.
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.240]  Technology, that's the thing of the future.
[26:39.680 --> 26:41.100]  Take the coffee quiz to get started.
[26:41.100 --> 26:45.700]  Trade Coffee guarantees you'll love your first bag or they'll replace it for free.
[26:46.200 --> 26:50.840]  Trade has been featured by the New York Times, Wired, GQ, those are all magazines for you
[26:50.840 --> 26:55.380]  Gen Zers out there who have never seen one in person, and it's delivered more than 5
[26:55.380 --> 26:57.160]  million bags of coffee.
[26:57.680 --> 26:59.300]  And the subscription is no hassle.
[26:59.480 --> 27:02.940]  Skip shipments, change your frequency, or cancel at any time.

[27:09.300 --> 27:13.360]  three bags when you go to drinktrade.com slash face.

[27:25.660 --> 27:26.160]  Coffee.
[27:26.460 --> 27:27.940]  Now that's an ad read I enjoy.
[27:28.540 --> 27:30.920]  A lot of people didn't even make resolutions this year.
[27:31.020 --> 27:31.600]  And you know what?
[27:31.640 --> 27:32.300]  I get it.
[27:32.460 --> 27:35.980]  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't still find a way to shake things up, whether it's
[27:35.980 --> 27:39.060]  by switching up your workout routine or going someplace new.
[27:39.480 --> 27:42.420]  You know, vary up the scenery, vary up the routine.
[27:42.860 --> 27:46.460]  Whatever way you challenge yourself this new year, there is no better way to do it than
[27:46.460 --> 27:50.620]  with a pair of Raycon wireless earbuds in your ears while you do it.
[27:50.760 --> 27:55.480]  Raycon wireless earbuds are the best way to bring audio with you on the go, no matter
[27:55.480 --> 27:56.460]  where you're going.
[27:56.740 --> 28:00.000]  Their everyday earbuds look, feel, and sound better than ever.
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.480]  There also is an awareness mode for when you need to listen to your surroundings, so you
[28:04.480 --> 28:06.800]  can take Raycons with you wherever you go and still be safe.
[28:07.260 --> 28:12.520]  With optimized gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit, these earbuds are so comfortable and
[28:12.520 --> 28:14.320]  they will not budge.
[28:14.400 --> 28:15.180]  They're not falling out.
[28:15.400 --> 28:15.900]  Trust me.
[28:16.300 --> 28:20.220]  I use them when I ride my bike and, you know, you're hitting bumps, you're going fast,
[28:20.240 --> 28:20.840]  up and down.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.620]  By the way, awareness mode, very important when you're moving in public.
[28:24.260 --> 28:25.880]  And they never, they never pop out.
[28:26.180 --> 28:30.560]  They also offer eight hours of playtime and a 32-hour battery life.
[28:31.080 --> 28:32.280]  And they're priced just right.
[28:32.280 --> 28:35.900]  You get quality audio at half the price of other premium audio brands.
[28:36.280 --> 28:41.440]  It is no wonder Raycon's everyday earbuds have more than 48,000 five-star reviews.
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.640]  And that's five out of five.
[28:42.780 --> 28:43.860]  That's not five out of ten.
[28:44.740 --> 28:51.060]  Right now, f***face listeners can get 15% off the Raycon order at buyraycon.com slash

[29:02.360 --> 29:05.740]  I have one other mystery that I've been, I've been sitting on a little bit in my personal
[29:05.740 --> 29:06.080]  life.
[29:06.540 --> 29:08.360]  So I fixed, the bed is fixed.
[29:08.780 --> 29:09.560]  I've talked about this before.
[29:09.560 --> 29:09.720]  How'd you fix it?
[29:10.480 --> 29:12.460]  I just, the box spring arrived.
[29:12.760 --> 29:12.940]  Oh.
[29:13.120 --> 29:14.140]  I gained a box spring.
[29:14.240 --> 29:15.040]  I lost a bed frame.
[29:15.100 --> 29:16.220]  My bed frame is now broken.
[29:16.380 --> 29:17.240]  So you're off the slats.
[29:17.840 --> 29:18.880]  I'm off the slats.
[29:19.080 --> 29:22.940]  I've, I've upgraded from the slats, built it like it's all good.
[29:23.020 --> 29:24.200]  It was the night it was finished.
[29:24.300 --> 29:25.380]  I laid down in bed.
[29:25.720 --> 29:30.720]  I was very comfortable and I was just looking at the Play Store and I decided I'm going to
[29:30.720 --> 29:32.660]  buy the shitty $2 mobile game.
[29:32.780 --> 29:33.160]  Why not?
[29:33.220 --> 29:34.180]  This seems like a great time.
[29:34.780 --> 29:38.640]  So I go to buy it and they asked me to put in my Gmail password for it.
[29:38.860 --> 29:43.100]  And I don't remember what it is and I have it saved on my computer, but I just didn't
[29:43.100 --> 29:44.120]  feel like getting up out of bed.
[29:44.160 --> 29:44.840]  I just laid down.
[29:44.960 --> 29:45.360]  I was cozy.
[29:45.780 --> 29:46.840]  So I just guessed.
[29:46.960 --> 29:48.040]  I was like, I'm just going to guess.
[29:48.160 --> 29:51.480]  I've got like six or seven in my head that I think it could be.
[29:51.700 --> 29:55.040]  So I just go through the list of those and none of them work.
[29:55.180 --> 29:58.000]  And then it gets to the point where it's like, hey, you've run out of tries.
[29:58.120 --> 29:59.420]  You can't, you can't try anymore.
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.060]  Do you want to like reset your password?
[30:02.160 --> 30:05.620]  I don't need to reset my password because I can easily like it's fine.
[30:05.800 --> 30:08.200]  I don't necessarily need this $2 mobile game.
[30:08.340 --> 30:09.480]  But I was like, you know what?
[30:09.540 --> 30:13.200]  I don't even this is how little I feel like getting out of bed right now.
[30:13.280 --> 30:15.860]  I'm just going to reset my password and then it's fine.
[30:15.980 --> 30:17.180]  Then I can just buy this thing.
[30:17.440 --> 30:18.920]  So I reset my password.
[30:19.340 --> 30:20.400]  No problem doing it.
[30:20.480 --> 30:21.240]  Go through the thing.
[30:21.820 --> 30:23.320]  Ask me to verify code.
[30:23.380 --> 30:24.840]  It sends it to my alternate email.
[30:25.020 --> 30:25.340]  Great.
[30:25.500 --> 30:25.860]  Awesome.
[30:26.200 --> 30:26.940]  New password.
[30:27.700 --> 30:32.820]  When you sign out of or change a password on like a Gmail account and you have two-factor
[30:32.820 --> 30:37.060]  authentication on it, it signs you out everywhere as soon as you do it.
[30:37.520 --> 30:37.560]  Yeah.
[30:37.600 --> 30:39.600]  So I changed my password.
[30:39.880 --> 30:43.920]  Then I go to sign into my account and it says, OK, we need to verify this is you.
[30:44.180 --> 30:47.100]  We have pushed an alert to your Google Pixel.
[30:47.760 --> 30:48.420]  Click yes.
[30:48.660 --> 30:49.240]  And you're in.
[30:49.300 --> 30:50.240]  And nothing comes.
[30:50.660 --> 30:52.860]  There's just nothing shows up on my Pixel.
[30:53.500 --> 30:54.880]  So I'm like, OK, that didn't work.
[30:55.000 --> 30:55.480]  Try again.
[30:55.480 --> 30:58.060]  So then it says, OK, we'll text you.
[30:58.420 --> 31:00.900]  We'll text you at this number and then put in the code.
[31:01.160 --> 31:02.480]  It's my last phone number.
[31:02.600 --> 31:04.280]  For some reason, I never change my phone number.
[31:04.440 --> 31:06.280]  It's my previous phone number.
[31:06.640 --> 31:07.560]  And I'm like, oh, fuck.
[31:07.600 --> 31:08.600]  OK, we'll try again.
[31:08.880 --> 31:09.940]  So I click try again.
[31:10.160 --> 31:15.920]  And it says, OK, we're going to email you a verification code to the email you're locked
[31:15.920 --> 31:16.300]  out of.
[31:16.300 --> 31:17.920]  Just put that in and then you're all good.
[31:18.220 --> 31:23.320]  It for some reason has just decided my alternate email doesn't exist.
[31:23.560 --> 31:25.020]  I have hacked my own account.
[31:25.020 --> 31:27.260]  I cannot get into my Gmail.
[31:27.260 --> 31:30.280]  I lost access to my Gmail Sunday night.
[31:30.540 --> 31:32.240]  I have yet to be able to get back in.
[31:32.600 --> 31:36.640]  I kept trying to the point where it said you can no longer attempt to even recover this
[31:36.640 --> 31:36.900]  email.
[31:37.180 --> 31:42.140]  But I'm in a stage now where I've given them alternate information and they're like, we
[31:42.140 --> 31:46.520]  will get back to you after 48 hours, which is a really weird phrasing of when we'll get
[31:46.520 --> 31:47.140]  back to you.
[31:47.500 --> 31:48.820]  Because it could be months from now.
[31:49.020 --> 31:51.140]  I don't know when I'm going to get my personal email back.
[31:51.140 --> 31:56.140]  And all I wanted to do was download a $2 rock star, a rock band clone.
[31:56.440 --> 31:59.920]  It was a dumb mobile game and I've lost everything.
[32:00.240 --> 32:01.800]  All because your bed was too comfy.
[32:02.260 --> 32:04.880]  All because my bed was too comfy and I fixed it.
[32:04.960 --> 32:09.960]  And I just, it fucking is crazy to me that they will not recognize that I have an email
[32:09.960 --> 32:10.440]  that isn't.
[32:10.620 --> 32:15.560]  The fact it keeps saying, we'll send you a verification code to your email that you're
[32:15.560 --> 32:17.720]  trying to get into is insane.
[32:17.720 --> 32:19.400]  And I'm sure that that's my fault.
[32:19.400 --> 32:24.260]  I somehow fucked that up at some point, but just, there's another email there that you
[32:24.260 --> 32:26.560]  asked me for when I changed my password.
[32:26.820 --> 32:28.960]  Why have you now decided that that isn't valid?
[32:29.880 --> 32:31.140]  This has been my pain.
[32:31.420 --> 32:32.420]  I don't know what to do.
[32:32.960 --> 32:33.700]  I didn't even know.
[32:33.800 --> 32:38.040]  I don't ever memorize my own phone number, so I didn't remember what the number was.
[32:38.100 --> 32:43.640]  So that's why on Slack a few days ago, I passed, I posted, hey, do any of you guys have a number
[32:43.640 --> 32:45.140]  that ends with these numbers?
[32:45.480 --> 32:46.820]  How do you not remember your phone number?
[32:47.300 --> 32:48.500]  So I, I do.
[32:48.600 --> 32:49.100]  Do you need it?
[32:49.100 --> 32:53.920]  No, I remembered that on Amazon, they have numbers saved with previous addresses.
[32:54.160 --> 32:55.800]  So I was able to find it that way.
[32:55.980 --> 33:01.360]  The reason why I don't remember my phone number, Gavin, is because my dad took my number when
[33:01.360 --> 33:02.160]  I was a teenager.
[33:02.520 --> 33:07.160]  He was paying for my phone plan and he was getting rid of one phone and he's like, yeah,
[33:07.200 --> 33:08.320]  I need your number.
[33:08.700 --> 33:13.980]  So he just took my phone number and I just have refused to ever learn a number past that.
[33:14.460 --> 33:19.540]  Ever since that point, I just don't, there, I have, I don't, it's such an annoyance.
[33:19.780 --> 33:22.180]  Wouldn't your friends at the time text your dad by accident?
[33:22.720 --> 33:24.880]  I know, I just, I wouldn't use, I never use my phone.
[33:25.020 --> 33:25.900]  I'm not a phone guy.
[33:26.440 --> 33:28.260]  Nobody I interacted with would text me.
[33:28.580 --> 33:31.420]  Use different messaging services for that purpose.
[33:32.580 --> 33:33.920]  There are no texts going on.
[33:34.220 --> 33:36.360]  So if I text your old number, am I talking to your dad?
[33:37.040 --> 33:40.920]  No, a number before, you never knew that number, I don't think.
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.660]  I don't think you were aware of that phone number.
[33:43.040 --> 33:45.660]  So who am I texting if I text that number that you asked about?
[33:45.680 --> 33:47.260]  That's the thing. I don't know.
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.820]  And my hope is, is that that, I don't know if that number is even in service.
[33:51.900 --> 33:55.300]  So it's like, maybe I should just call the number and see if somebody is there.
[33:55.320 --> 33:57.140]  Cause I can get the code from them.
[33:57.420 --> 33:59.040]  Then I'm totally fine.
[33:59.140 --> 33:59.620]  I believe.
[33:59.760 --> 34:01.060]  I don't think there's any other issues.
[34:01.300 --> 34:01.920]  Should I call?
[34:02.180 --> 34:06.140]  Just text that number and say, hey, can you, can you just post the code you're
[34:06.140 --> 34:07.040]  about to get to this number?
[34:07.500 --> 34:08.980]  But they can ignore the text.
[34:09.060 --> 34:09.940]  Like, I don't, I don't know.
[34:10.740 --> 34:13.800]  They can ignore that text or they could answer it.
[34:13.840 --> 34:14.500]  You'll never know.
[34:15.540 --> 34:17.700]  But if I just, you'll contact anybody on earth.
[34:18.080 --> 34:20.900]  You would, you would try to contact the president for an interview if you could,
[34:21.100 --> 34:23.280]  but you're scared to contact the owner of your old phone.
[34:23.360 --> 34:24.180]  Just text them right now.
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.040]  Well, it's the texting mechanism is what I don't trust.
[34:28.160 --> 34:30.800]  Like I don't, if it's not act like, what if it's just not active?
[34:31.340 --> 34:35.340]  I'm just wasting my time and I'm mad at this non-existing person.
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.080]  And if it's not active, I think I theoretically could
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.620]  get that number back.
[34:40.960 --> 34:44.760]  If I went back to the previous company I was getting service for.
[34:44.760 --> 34:45.260]  That's interesting.
[34:46.100 --> 34:48.480]  Because there have been times where I've been locked out of accounts.
[34:48.780 --> 34:50.360]  And then I've just copied the email.
[34:50.600 --> 34:52.400]  I recreated the email that didn't exist.
[34:52.780 --> 34:56.100]  And then I was able to get in because I was sending it to the new email that I made.
[34:56.160 --> 34:56.700]  That was labeled.
[34:57.140 --> 34:57.620]  I'm going to call.
[34:57.740 --> 34:58.220]  I'm going to call this.
[34:58.340 --> 34:58.920]  Let's see if this is...
[34:59.580 --> 35:00.220]  You're going to call now?
[35:00.900 --> 35:01.560]  Yeah, I know.
[35:01.600 --> 35:01.760]  Okay.
[35:02.360 --> 35:04.280]  The number you are calling is unavailable.
[35:04.600 --> 35:05.600]  Please try again later.
[35:05.840 --> 35:07.300]  That, oh, oh.
[35:07.300 --> 35:12.760]  Oh, that's a phone that is off or not in service, I think.
[35:13.420 --> 35:13.680]  Yeah.
[35:13.920 --> 35:14.140]  That's unfortunate.
[35:14.480 --> 35:14.720]  Okay.
[35:15.020 --> 35:17.780]  Well, no, that's actually kind of a positive because I can then...
[35:17.780 --> 35:21.440]  Yeah, if it doesn't have a voicemail, it's been gone a while, I think.
[35:21.720 --> 35:22.660]  Yeah, probably.
[35:23.060 --> 35:24.000]  I'm going to look into this.
[35:24.400 --> 35:26.660]  I'm going to see if I can get my old number back.
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.920]  But that has been my annoyance is the fact that I essentially hacked into my own account
[35:30.920 --> 35:33.900]  and Google is protecting me from getting into my account.
[35:34.380 --> 35:36.480]  You should try to get that number quickly.
[35:37.300 --> 35:38.920]  As quickly as possible before I get it.
[35:41.220 --> 35:43.280]  Before I figure out how to get it.
[35:43.320 --> 35:46.460]  No, you would care because you'll never, you'll never get that fucking code.
[35:46.600 --> 35:47.480]  I guarantee you that.
[35:50.040 --> 35:52.920]  I'm, I don't know if, yeah, I don't know if you want to go to war, Geoff.
[35:53.380 --> 35:54.420]  I find a way.
[35:55.640 --> 35:56.000]  Retaliate.
[35:56.740 --> 35:57.620]  I know you would.
[35:57.720 --> 35:58.200]  I know you would.
[35:58.500 --> 35:59.700]  Port-a-potty is just the beginning.
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.640]  Yeah, I wouldn't mess with him.
[36:03.880 --> 36:04.600]  That's wave one.
[36:04.600 --> 36:09.740]  Should I talk about the, uh, absolute face I did to myself last night in bed?
[36:10.080 --> 36:11.920]  Oh, I'm so excited to hear this.
[36:12.100 --> 36:12.780]  Dude, please. Yeah.
[36:12.920 --> 36:19.880]  I just had probably the shortest duration face, the most instant face that I've ever experienced.
[36:20.700 --> 36:21.520]  Go on.
[36:21.720 --> 36:27.520]  I was in bed, uh, trying to watch, uh, not to talk about Bo Burnham again,
[36:27.700 --> 36:30.980]  but I was trying to watch his show that just went on Netflix for ages ago.
[36:30.980 --> 36:32.020]  Uh-huh.
[36:32.920 --> 36:33.300]  With Beck.
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.960]  And the Apple TV remote is an utter piece of shit.
[36:38.160 --> 36:40.600]  I don't know if you've experienced this turd.
[36:41.820 --> 36:45.500]  I've had so many experiences where, like, the skip ahead 10 seconds,
[36:45.580 --> 36:48.440]  and the skip back 10 seconds on the, on the time, on the, on the sides,
[36:48.660 --> 36:49.900]  just stopped working after a while.
[36:49.960 --> 36:51.940]  Like, I've, I've had these replaced before.
[36:52.060 --> 36:56.580]  I'm at, I'm at the point with this one where I'm just like, this is so bad.
[36:56.980 --> 36:59.140]  You, so the clicks on the side stop working.
[36:59.140 --> 37:01.180]  So it doesn't skip back 10 seconds each time.
[37:01.640 --> 37:03.660]  So you end up trying to actually, like,
[37:04.060 --> 37:07.840]  manually moving the playhead on a video around it, just skipping all over the place.
[37:07.980 --> 37:08.640]  And I'm getting annoyed.
[37:08.740 --> 37:10.100]  I'm like, it's a shitty thing.
[37:10.440 --> 37:13.920]  And Meg's laughing at me because I complain about this damn thing constantly.
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.420]  So she's making fun of me that I just don't do anything about it.
[37:17.020 --> 37:19.800]  Um, and I like to do things just rad.
[37:19.900 --> 37:23.200]  Like, I like to surprise Meg in quite extreme ways sometimes.
[37:23.460 --> 37:28.220]  For example, she recently told me, um, that I've been wearing a shirt too long
[37:28.220 --> 37:30.840]  because it had a hole in it and she's been staring at this hole for years.
[37:31.180 --> 37:34.100]  So I just put my finger through it and just tore the shirt off my body.
[37:34.200 --> 37:36.460]  Like I hulked out of it and she thought that was funny.
[37:36.540 --> 37:39.840]  So I thought, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do something about this Apple remote.
[37:40.240 --> 37:44.020]  So in the middle of the conversation of me complaining about this Apple remote,
[37:44.300 --> 37:47.500]  I just out of nowhere snapped it in half.
[37:47.660 --> 37:49.620]  I just snapped it right down the middle.
[37:50.380 --> 37:55.380]  And what it felt like was that someone threw a cup of sand in my face.
[37:55.380 --> 38:02.720]  And then I just heard what sounded like sand raining all over both of us and the bed.
[38:03.280 --> 38:05.780]  Turns out they're made of glass.
[38:07.240 --> 38:09.500]  The whole thing is glass.
[38:09.960 --> 38:18.400]  I shot tiny shards of glass into my eyes and face all over both of us.
[38:19.720 --> 38:23.080]  It was raining down on the entire bedroom at like 11 PM.
[38:23.700 --> 38:30.800]  And I've just sat there with glass in my hair and my chest hair in my,
[38:30.800 --> 38:33.400]  in my cup of tea on my nightstand.
[38:39.860 --> 38:44.020]  So I'm like, wow, what an actual definition of face.
[38:44.220 --> 38:48.300]  I shot myself in the foot because just for a joke.
[38:48.400 --> 38:49.520]  What an idiot.
[38:49.860 --> 38:52.060]  I had to strip the bed sheets.
[38:53.700 --> 38:58.980]  I'm hoovering up this tiny like sand glass from the entire room.
[38:59.100 --> 39:02.880]  I can't find a single piece of floor that doesn't look like it's covered in glitter.
[39:03.560 --> 39:04.640]  Changing the sheets.
[39:05.260 --> 39:06.900]  We're laughing about it at first.
[39:06.940 --> 39:11.220]  Then after like, you know, 10 minutes, we're just like, oh, what a move, right?
[39:11.300 --> 39:13.020]  Like what a turn.
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.820]  We're like winding down for the evening.
[39:15.460 --> 39:17.240]  So then I'm putting the sheets on.
[39:17.240 --> 39:18.740]  I'm putting the replacement sheets on.
[39:19.240 --> 39:21.740]  Dragging the sheets over the bottom corner of the bed.
[39:22.340 --> 39:22.980]  Pushing down.
[39:23.460 --> 39:26.860]  Suddenly I just hear it and my face hits the bed.
[39:27.140 --> 39:29.320]  I tear the brand new bed sheet.
[39:30.420 --> 39:32.020]  Putting it all around the mattress.
[39:32.600 --> 39:34.140]  My face hits the bed.
[39:34.480 --> 39:38.740]  I'm on my knees at this point and I'm just like, I need to go to bed.
[39:39.140 --> 39:41.760]  I don't know what's wrong with this sort of 30 minute period,
[39:41.960 --> 39:44.000]  but I'm not having a good time in it.
[39:44.260 --> 39:45.620]  It's everything's going wrong.
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.140]  So those are my bed problems.
[39:49.340 --> 39:52.360]  My bed face from last night.
[39:52.780 --> 39:58.420]  Do you think you think they were unrelated or do you think one related to like you connected
[39:58.420 --> 40:06.040]  because of the remote that you somehow you what if your fingers had thousands of tiny
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.920]  microscopic pieces of glass embedded in there and now you just have like razor hands and
[40:10.920 --> 40:14.120]  you rip to the sheets with your little tiny shark tooth.
[40:14.120 --> 40:15.160]  Gavin glass hands.
[40:15.340 --> 40:18.000]  I honestly have glass all over my hands.
[40:20.360 --> 40:26.680]  That thing, I highly, I highly recommend when you get annoyed at that thing, just put
[40:26.680 --> 40:27.160]  it in the bin.
[40:27.300 --> 40:28.240]  Don't do that to it.
[40:28.980 --> 40:31.620]  You guys, you guys got to stay away from your bedrooms.
[40:31.780 --> 40:32.440]  They're dangerous.
[40:34.180 --> 40:35.720]  How's your bedroom been recently, Geoff?
[40:35.740 --> 40:36.160]  It's fine.
[40:36.320 --> 40:36.760]  It's totally fine.
[40:36.820 --> 40:37.220]  No problems.
[40:37.300 --> 40:37.700]  No issues.
[40:38.000 --> 40:38.700]  Don't even want to talk about it.
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.880]  You fucking cut a hole through your bed with your your glass hands.
[40:45.040 --> 40:45.500]  I know.
[40:45.760 --> 40:46.720]  That's unbelievable.
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.040]  So it's a shitty remote.
[40:50.120 --> 40:56.940]  But if you want to turn into Wolverine very cheaply, all you have to do is if you need
[40:56.940 --> 40:59.880]  a weapon quickly, just snap one of those puppies.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.320]  You can be.
[41:01.400 --> 41:04.960]  It's like, you know, how like the Joker would leave a Joker card at the scene of the crime.
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.880]  Gavin glass hands slices a hole in the bed.
[41:15.560 --> 41:16.980]  That didn't disappoint.
[41:18.940 --> 41:20.820]  You can still see and stuff, though, right?
[41:21.620 --> 41:23.060]  You don't have glass in your eyes.
[41:23.640 --> 41:25.580]  Like you're okay.
[41:25.980 --> 41:26.620]  It's a trade.
[41:27.420 --> 41:30.500]  You have no vision, but you can cut through any bed you want.
[41:32.560 --> 41:34.380]  So that's why I texted you last night.
[41:34.960 --> 41:37.420]  I just faced the shit out of myself.
[41:37.580 --> 41:38.680]  You said podcast story.
[41:38.820 --> 41:41.180]  I said, yes, just change the bedsheets.
[41:41.300 --> 41:43.840]  You said tomorrow is going to be incredible.
[41:44.580 --> 41:46.320]  Oh, and I was right.
[41:46.580 --> 41:50.380]  What makes me so happy is I was so cozy in bed when I got that text.
[41:50.420 --> 41:53.020]  I was just all comfortable, relaxed.
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.840]  Yeah, I was about 20 minutes earlier.
[41:56.340 --> 42:01.740]  Are you scared now that if you meet Bo Burnham, he's just going to die immediately or like
[42:01.740 --> 42:04.700]  something horrible will happen to him?
[42:05.320 --> 42:09.840]  Like you seem to have this fandom for this person, but every engagement you have with
[42:09.840 --> 42:11.440]  them is a negative in some way.
[42:11.780 --> 42:16.860]  Well, this remote has not been working on many more shows than this Bo Burnham show,
[42:17.380 --> 42:19.140]  but I don't think they're related.
[42:19.340 --> 42:20.400]  What's the breaking point?
[42:20.660 --> 42:25.040]  We're going to find out that Gavin is the carrier of a disease that only Bo Burnham is
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.340]  I mean, just to be sure, I'll try and avoid him, unfortunately.
[42:31.680 --> 42:34.520]  But yeah, as long as I can still watch his content.
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.340]  According to his content, he's had it hard enough, man.
[42:37.360 --> 42:38.500]  He doesn't need you in his life.
[42:42.900 --> 42:50.660]  He's like an alien from War of the Worlds, and Gavin is the one thing he hasn't been
[42:50.660 --> 42:51.440]  exposed to.
[42:51.640 --> 42:53.400]  His next special is just called Gavin.
[42:53.980 --> 42:58.280]  Can you imagine how disappointed Gavin would be if he found out that Bo Burnham liked the
[42:58.280 --> 42:59.520]  most recent Matrix movie?
[42:59.760 --> 43:01.000]  That would just end everything.
[43:01.420 --> 43:03.040]  There'd be nothing more disappointing.
[43:05.400 --> 43:07.280]  Remember that thing I said about pleasantries?
[43:07.500 --> 43:08.840]  Never have them with Bo Burnham.
[43:09.100 --> 43:11.920]  Spend as little time with him as possible in the future.
[43:12.300 --> 43:15.460]  Look, other people's opinions on movies aren't make or break to the relationship.
[43:15.600 --> 43:16.360]  They really mean nothing.
[43:16.860 --> 43:20.700]  You said you would cease to be my friend if I liked that movie.
[43:20.840 --> 43:21.580]  I strongly...
[43:21.580 --> 43:24.040]  I was just trying to get you to watch the movie.
[43:24.520 --> 43:26.920]  Why would that make me want to watch the movie?
[43:28.600 --> 43:30.300]  How is that an incentive?
[43:31.160 --> 43:32.300]  I really didn't say that.
[43:32.440 --> 43:34.100]  I was like, I don't think less of you as a person.
[43:34.100 --> 43:38.900]  No, you said it would end our friendship and you would cease to make this podcast.
[43:39.540 --> 43:40.360]  Yes, you did.
[43:41.520 --> 43:44.960]  You would disown anybody that thought that that movie was great.
[43:45.980 --> 43:47.660]  Look, if you like that movie, that's fine.
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.280]  I just really didn't like it.
[43:53.220 --> 43:54.240]  That's not the tone you can say.
[43:54.240 --> 43:55.080]  A lot of people love it.
[43:55.100 --> 43:55.740]  A lot of people love it.
[43:55.760 --> 43:56.480]  I can see why they do.
[43:57.380 --> 44:03.900]  When we were playing Halo, Trevor brought up that he enjoyed it and it sounded like a
[44:03.900 --> 44:07.060]  The Matrix bear was there and he would not tolerate.
[44:07.400 --> 44:08.240]  Gavin would not allow...
[44:08.240 --> 44:09.840]  I'm not here to guard the fourth Matrix.
[44:10.340 --> 44:13.820]  Gavin Glass hands would be all over him if he said he enjoyed that film.
[44:18.750 --> 44:20.050]  I should watch it now.
[44:20.490 --> 44:23.230]  Well, now that I know that it won't end our friendship, I might watch it.
[44:23.710 --> 44:25.070]  No, I really I hope you like it.
[44:25.110 --> 44:25.570]  I hope you do.
[44:25.650 --> 44:27.010]  I'm sad that I didn't.
[44:27.150 --> 44:28.590]  Maybe that's our next tuxedo watching.
[44:29.110 --> 44:31.630]  I still haven't heard back from the director of the tuxedo.
[44:31.770 --> 44:33.750]  I sent him one more email yesterday.
[44:33.750 --> 44:35.090]  My last one.
[44:35.870 --> 44:38.430]  I'm hopeful, but I don't I don't think we're going to get it.
[44:38.650 --> 44:40.750]  I'm telling you, you have created an enemy.
[44:41.490 --> 44:42.950]  I don't want an enemy.
[44:43.090 --> 44:44.210]  I want a friend, Geoff.
[44:44.250 --> 44:45.390]  I'm trying to make a friend.
[44:45.730 --> 44:47.710]  Well, you're going about it in a weird way.
[44:48.030 --> 44:49.990]  Yeah, don't insult someone and give them your phone number.
[44:50.050 --> 44:51.110]  That's not how you make friends.
[44:51.270 --> 44:54.990]  I feel the only movie you were lucky enough to make in your life.
[44:55.170 --> 44:56.050]  We made fun of it.
[44:56.150 --> 44:57.190]  Do you want to be my friend?
[44:58.790 --> 44:59.510]  I didn't.
[44:59.570 --> 44:59.930]  I didn't.
[45:00.010 --> 45:03.110]  That's like I understand what you're saying when you say it on paper.
[45:03.110 --> 45:04.650]  It is a terrible idea.
[45:05.030 --> 45:09.010]  But genuinely, I was hoping for a friendship with the director of the tuxedo.
[45:09.470 --> 45:10.870]  And I still think it's possible.
[45:11.330 --> 45:12.130]  I still believe.
[45:12.570 --> 45:14.630]  I had a movie blunder of my own this week.
[45:14.990 --> 45:16.690]  I was, yeah, I was trying to watch.
[45:17.530 --> 45:23.650]  I wanted to watch Beer Fest because Geoff said it had that moment where the guy dies and
[45:23.650 --> 45:26.570]  then his brother comes along and just is that guy.
[45:26.810 --> 45:27.570]  Sure. Yeah.
[45:28.110 --> 45:28.350]  Yeah.
[45:28.510 --> 45:31.210]  I was like 80 minutes into the movie and I was like,
[45:31.210 --> 45:33.690]  when is this guy going to show up?
[45:33.990 --> 45:36.570]  Realized I was watching Beer League.
[45:37.190 --> 45:38.410]  Which is the Artie Lange movie.
[45:38.650 --> 45:39.850]  The Artie Lange movie.
[45:40.010 --> 45:40.930]  Ralph Macchio.
[45:41.350 --> 45:42.510]  Oh, my God.
[45:42.770 --> 45:44.250]  I was like 80 minutes into that.
[45:44.350 --> 45:46.150]  I was like, oh, shit.
[45:46.190 --> 45:47.290]  It was Beer Fest.
[45:48.070 --> 45:49.270]  Oh, dude.
[45:49.730 --> 45:50.250]  Wow.
[45:50.870 --> 45:52.130]  You're 80 minutes in?
[45:55.170 --> 45:57.110]  Very similar sounding films.
[45:57.750 --> 45:58.750]  Yeah, that's true.
[45:58.850 --> 46:00.870]  And they came out around the same time, too, actually.
[46:01.630 --> 46:02.030]  Yeah.
[46:02.130 --> 46:02.790]  Beer League.
[46:02.830 --> 46:03.590]  Oh, man.
[46:04.110 --> 46:05.790]  Beer League is no dirty work.
[46:05.890 --> 46:06.330]  I'll say that.
[46:07.150 --> 46:07.750]  Oh, yeah.
[46:07.930 --> 46:09.510]  No, it was a dirty work.
[46:09.590 --> 46:10.150]  A much better movie.
[46:10.730 --> 46:14.810]  Hey, did we ever talk about how you guys probably killed Betty White?
[46:16.650 --> 46:18.010]  I won't take that one.
[46:18.530 --> 46:22.670]  I mean, maybe considering the timing of when the episode came out.
[46:22.750 --> 46:25.370]  But when we actually talked about Betty White, it wasn't really anywhere near that.
[46:25.830 --> 46:27.770]  No, this is quite a long time ago.
[46:27.830 --> 46:28.870]  We killed Truly Scrumptious.
[46:28.990 --> 46:29.690]  No doubt about it.
[46:29.850 --> 46:30.770]  That was the next day.
[46:31.350 --> 46:31.790]  Yeah.
[46:32.190 --> 46:36.910]  Do you think it would be a bad taste to just, like, say t***?
[46:38.190 --> 46:39.170]  Would that be bad?
[46:40.270 --> 46:41.430]  What do you have against t***?
[46:42.170 --> 46:43.330]  No, just, you know, t***.
[46:44.190 --> 46:44.630]  What?
[46:46.350 --> 46:50.370]  Andrew's trying to fucking kill the guys like a national treasure.
[46:51.090 --> 46:52.290]  What are you doing?
[46:52.590 --> 46:55.450]  Listen, I'm not the one with glass all over my hands right now.
[46:55.710 --> 46:57.950]  I'm saying, I'm just bringing up a name.
[46:58.150 --> 46:59.730]  Why would you risk t***?
[46:59.730 --> 47:02.070]  Can we just believe the name he said?
[47:02.190 --> 47:05.550]  He was the first person to survive COVID, for Christ's sake.
[47:05.630 --> 47:06.690]  Yeah, didn't we use his blood?
[47:07.690 --> 47:08.830]  I love t***.
[47:09.230 --> 47:10.450]  Well, stop saying his name!
[47:10.470 --> 47:11.750]  Stop saying his name!
[47:12.050 --> 47:13.110]  I'm a big fan.
[47:13.170 --> 47:14.250]  What's wrong with you?
[47:14.670 --> 47:15.490]  I'm a big fan.
[47:15.730 --> 47:16.450]  I'm just trying to...
[47:16.450 --> 47:20.190]  Of all people you could pick, you could pick, like, the most beloved guy in Hollywood?
[47:20.830 --> 47:21.190]  Oh!
[47:21.530 --> 47:24.350]  I was just saying, like, wouldn't that be sad if that happened?
[47:24.370 --> 47:25.210]  What are you doing?
[47:25.350 --> 47:26.330]  Oh, stop!
[47:26.870 --> 47:28.470]  Why do you keep saying it?
[47:28.470 --> 47:32.250]  I, um, well, who, um...
[47:32.250 --> 47:33.430]  It doesn't work that way!
[47:33.670 --> 47:35.870]  If you want to kill somebody, they don't die.
[47:36.050 --> 47:37.290]  It's only people that you like.
[47:37.410 --> 47:38.430]  And I love t***.
[47:39.210 --> 47:40.110]  T*** is great.
[47:40.530 --> 47:41.050]  I love t***.
[47:41.330 --> 47:42.630]  Stop! Stop saying it!
[47:43.350 --> 47:45.510]  Uh, I haven't liked his most recent films.
[47:45.590 --> 47:46.510]  How about that? Is that okay?
[47:47.290 --> 47:48.770]  Like, I didn't see a lot of them.
[47:49.450 --> 47:50.710]  The Hologram and the Kings?
[47:50.870 --> 47:51.850]  Like, I didn't see that.
[47:51.930 --> 47:52.390]  The Circle?
[47:52.610 --> 47:55.670]  Is that what the internet movie was that he was in?
[47:55.810 --> 47:56.470]  With t***?
[47:57.490 --> 47:58.830]  Oh, boy, I said another one.
[47:59.150 --> 47:59.810]  Oh, no.
[48:01.550 --> 48:03.290]  How do I navigate this?
[48:03.910 --> 48:06.450]  I mean, it doesn't work intentionally, so hopefully he's safe.
[48:06.650 --> 48:07.730]  Yeah, no, I'm sure it's fine.
[48:07.790 --> 48:09.470]  It's also all bullsh**. None of this matters.
[48:09.550 --> 48:10.470]  So I don't know what we're doing.
[48:10.870 --> 48:11.290]  Well, that's true.
[48:11.410 --> 48:12.550]  It's obviously, uh...
[48:12.550 --> 48:14.230]  Sure, obviously, obviously...
[48:14.790 --> 48:15.290]  Complete bullsh**.
[48:15.870 --> 48:16.650]  But still...
[48:16.650 --> 48:16.850]  Complete...
[48:16.850 --> 48:17.310]  But still...
[48:18.030 --> 48:20.350]  All it does is say something about you.
[48:20.350 --> 48:21.150]  Oh, God.
[48:24.750 --> 48:26.810]  Are there anything that you're supernatural about?
[48:27.110 --> 48:28.450]  Like, that, like, you have a routine?
[48:28.870 --> 48:34.590]  Like, what's a routine thing for you that, like, doesn't actually make sense, but you feel is true.
[48:34.970 --> 48:36.690]  Something that you believe is true, even though it isn't.
[48:36.710 --> 48:37.890]  Yeah, like a little superstition.
[48:38.290 --> 48:38.570]  Yeah.
[48:39.710 --> 48:43.250]  I mean, I don't walk under ladders, but that's nothing to do with superstition.
[48:43.410 --> 48:43.830]  It's just...
[48:44.610 --> 48:46.310]  Someone could drop something on your head.
[48:46.930 --> 48:49.070]  Yeah, when a stick has fallen from the sky and hit you,
[48:49.070 --> 48:53.150]  I could understand having a general not-trust of things from above.
[48:55.030 --> 48:57.250]  I must have some, I just can't think of any.
[48:57.530 --> 49:00.050]  Really? Not a single superstition?
[49:00.050 --> 49:02.330]  Not that it's born out of fear.
[49:02.630 --> 49:04.110]  I do a lot of stuff out of routine.
[49:04.570 --> 49:10.770]  Like, I draw, like, a little face in the shower on the wind, like, in the glass every shower I take.
[49:10.870 --> 49:12.510]  And I can't reach the shower until I do.
[49:13.610 --> 49:16.070]  Could you recreate the shower outside of the shower?
[49:16.210 --> 49:18.110]  Or can it only be in the shower that you feel...
[49:18.110 --> 49:21.270]  Just only in the steam of a shower that I draw the little face.
[49:21.410 --> 49:23.930]  I've been doing it for years. Every shower I've taken.
[49:24.730 --> 49:27.590]  I don't know why, but now I have to do it because I've been doing it, you know?
[49:28.070 --> 49:29.770]  You're like, oh, it's been like 1,200 days.
[49:29.770 --> 49:30.330]  Where are the ears?
[49:32.110 --> 49:32.810]  There's no ears.
[49:32.970 --> 49:33.670]  What type of mouth?
[49:34.950 --> 49:36.310]  You don't look up in a shower.
[49:37.210 --> 49:39.490]  No, well, it depends.
[49:40.110 --> 49:43.550]  If it's your back face, like, if your back is, then looking up is nice.
[49:44.330 --> 49:44.490]  Yeah.
[49:44.670 --> 49:47.250]  It's really positional. It's a positional look up.
[49:47.250 --> 49:49.370]  But not all scenarios speak.
[49:49.530 --> 49:51.890]  You know what? Hey, something I wanted to talk about.
[49:52.070 --> 49:54.590]  I don't think Gavin is aware of this.
[49:54.950 --> 49:57.670]  We have we have faced speaking of celebrities.
[49:58.030 --> 50:00.210]  We have faced our own our own thing.
[50:01.050 --> 50:04.870]  Our own what we've we've predicted has come true.
[50:04.950 --> 50:05.250]  Gavin.
[50:09.370 --> 50:13.290]  Are you I know it's a terrible way of setting that up.
[50:14.950 --> 50:16.970]  What is the fuck?
[50:17.310 --> 50:18.670]  This is so fucking funny to me.
[50:18.770 --> 50:20.390]  This is so funny to me.
[50:20.710 --> 50:21.770]  It's very funny.
[50:21.930 --> 50:23.690]  So I'm sure it is.
[50:23.710 --> 50:24.430]  You got to say it.
[50:24.590 --> 50:25.590]  Yeah, I'm getting there.
[50:25.910 --> 50:26.530]  Give me a minute.
[50:27.470 --> 50:32.790]  John Cena is making a peacekeeper podcast on the Rooster Teeth Network.
[50:33.210 --> 50:33.390]  Yeah.
[50:33.950 --> 50:36.470]  And it was recently reported on by Variety.
[50:37.630 --> 50:38.930]  I'm going to just read you.
[50:39.710 --> 50:44.990]  V Variety, one of the the high, I'd say the highest profile entertainment magazine
[50:44.990 --> 50:48.570]  in in L.A. in Hollywood, I would say that wrong.
[50:48.650 --> 50:49.690]  It's definitely top three.
[50:50.150 --> 50:52.850]  Variety and Hollywood Reporter would be the they're the only games in town.
[50:53.390 --> 50:54.470]  They're the top ones.
[50:55.130 --> 50:58.750]  So it's a mention of that this podcast is going to be made by Rooster Teeth.
[50:58.870 --> 51:03.010]  And then in a part of it, there's an excerpt that says other podcasts from Rooster Teeth
[51:03.010 --> 51:06.410]  produced from studios in L.A. and Austin, Texas, include
[51:07.030 --> 51:14.750]  Face Jam, Off Topic, Black Box Down, Red Web, and the long running Rooster Teeth podcast,
[51:15.010 --> 51:17.290]  which now numbers more than 500 episodes.
[51:17.690 --> 51:19.350]  We were left off that list.
[51:20.230 --> 51:21.690]  We were not included.
[51:22.310 --> 51:23.350]  Oh, I wonder why.
[51:24.090 --> 51:26.250]  Really, really faced ourselves there.
[51:26.430 --> 51:29.810]  I wonder if we should just run an ad for Face on the John Cena podcast.
[51:30.470 --> 51:30.970]  That would.
[51:31.150 --> 51:31.890]  Can we do that?
[51:31.950 --> 51:33.710]  That'd be great if that's the thing we can do.
[51:33.710 --> 51:37.710]  I think going forward, any mention of Variety, Nick, make sure you bleep part of it.
[51:38.210 --> 51:39.170]  Yeah, make sure it's bleep.
[51:39.250 --> 51:39.890]  We're no longer.
[51:40.370 --> 51:41.710]  We got to censor part of their name.
[51:41.890 --> 51:45.910]  So like right now, I'm saying Variety, like that doesn't come through on bleeped.
[51:46.110 --> 51:48.050]  No, there's at least a bleep in it.
[51:48.410 --> 51:49.230]  Any any time.
[51:49.630 --> 51:50.930]  We also should have bleeped all of.
[51:52.010 --> 51:53.650]  Now, let's bleep all of.
[51:54.970 --> 51:56.690]  Going forward, this is how they'll be known.
[51:58.150 --> 52:00.530]  The star star variety.
[52:01.330 --> 52:07.350]  Um, I just love the idea that this like prestigious Hollywood writer company, whatever,
[52:07.550 --> 52:11.370]  they're looking at a list of things and that they have to decide if they're going to include
[52:11.370 --> 52:16.810]  Facebook or not, that the fact that there needs to be some level of dialogue at some stage of
[52:16.810 --> 52:23.110]  this process in which they need to either make the decision to include a podcast named Face or
[52:23.110 --> 52:28.790]  not at all when they didn't, which I get it, understand completely. But it's hilarious.
[52:28.790 --> 52:36.410]  I told Andrew last night that it or whenever we talked about it, that it was kind of a perfect
[52:36.410 --> 52:43.310]  virtuous moment because I got so fucking infuriated, like furious, like I was going to
[52:43.310 --> 52:48.030]  yell at people upset that we weren't in it, that we didn't get that we got one of the, you know,
[52:48.110 --> 52:52.070]  no offense to those other podcasts. They're all great, but, you know, we're larger than most of
[52:52.070 --> 52:58.490]  and we're doing very well for ourselves considering our name and in spite of our name.
[52:59.250 --> 53:05.850]  And then I realized that this is why I wanted to name it Face because I wanted to face ourselves.
[53:05.850 --> 53:11.990]  Right. And the fact that I got so angry in such a brief little window of time because we were
[53:11.990 --> 53:17.690]  excluded from that moment means actually a podcast. Yeah, I was actually angry means that
[53:17.690 --> 53:24.470]  podcast is so successful that it means this much to me that it made me mad, which made me happy
[53:24.470 --> 53:28.670]  because then I thought, oh, so we've arrived. We've made it. We're successful enough that I'm
[53:28.670 --> 53:33.490]  mad when we don't get mentioned. So it was like a perfect moment where I went from anger to bliss
[53:33.490 --> 53:42.610]  in a like that. Just to I pause, Gavin, let me continue from the story. Rooster Teeth also
[53:42.610 --> 53:47.530]  operates the Roos Podcast Network, which features partners such as the H3 Podcast.
[53:48.170 --> 53:54.450]  This might get weird with Grace Helbig and Mamrie Hart. Philip DeFranco is a conversation with and
[53:54.450 --> 54:00.770]  kind of funny. They name every other podcast, not even ones directly affiliated with. They name all
[54:00.770 --> 54:05.210]  of them. And to be clear, this isn't for me at all a thing of like we deserve to be on there. That's
[54:05.210 --> 54:10.330]  why I'm annoyed by it. I love the idea just because of our name alone that we have to be in those
[54:10.330 --> 54:15.630]  conversations and they have to have meetings in which they include. Do we do we talk about this?
[54:15.710 --> 54:20.590]  Yeah, it's like reading that, you know, we've been explicitly ignored. There's no way they could
[54:20.590 --> 54:27.110]  have missed us. Undeniably excluded, like without a doubt. Maybe they're just saving it. Maybe
[54:27.110 --> 54:34.350]  they're going to do an exclusive face interview, an article dedicated to the podcast, and they're
[54:34.350 --> 54:40.570]  saving it. Maybe when, uh, the director of the tuxedo directs the child kicker movie, we can get
[54:40.570 --> 54:49.050]  into variety through that. It'd be the perfect transition to Hollywood Connection. It is funny
[54:49.050 --> 54:53.610]  though, this name, like, because the company, there are people at the company who have real jobs and
[54:53.610 --> 54:58.570]  doing like, you know, real analytics, trying to see what's working, looking at the growth and
[54:59.190 --> 55:04.150]  faces on those, like with graphs and stuff and like projections. And it's like, yeah, why?
[55:04.150 --> 55:09.410]  It's called F*** Face. Of course it's not going to be, of course it can't be huge. What do you want?
[55:10.350 --> 55:18.750]  Like, read the name. It makes me, it's the best part. It's, I think, a fair trade of searchability
[55:18.750 --> 55:24.210]  versus the hilarity of anybody having, anyone that has to deal with the name of our show or
[55:24.210 --> 55:30.950]  any part of it that is outside of it, brings me eternal happiness. It makes me laugh every time.
[55:30.950 --> 55:35.510]  It's great. Did you see what Nick typed? When the director of the tuxedo follows a
[55:35.510 --> 55:38.350]  restraining order against Andrew, we'll finally make it in the variety.
[55:40.570 --> 55:45.750]  I will say, unfortunately, we wouldn't be the first F*** Face in variety. I was curious. So I
[55:45.750 --> 55:51.110]  looked on their thing. There is one opinion article about something Bill Maher said in like 2011,
[55:51.370 --> 55:55.970]  in which they quote him as saying F*** Face. So it wouldn't be the first. So they're not opposed to
[55:55.970 --> 56:02.490]  writing that. At least in 2012, they weren't. And they didn't even censor it. Like us. Classy
[56:02.490 --> 56:09.690]  individuals. We've done the work for them. We even bleep it in our own show. Couldn't be classier
[56:09.690 --> 56:14.550]  about it. I think it's time, Andrew, that you reached out to variety and see what the hell's
[56:14.550 --> 56:21.290]  going on over there. Yeah. Gotta investigate. I just, I'd love war on all media. War on all media.
[56:21.290 --> 56:28.130]  Yeah. We talked about that. We did. We should just write an email where that is the subject line.
[56:28.590 --> 56:35.830]  War on all media. This name keeps delivering. It does. Or preventing deliveries. We keep f***ing
[56:35.830 --> 56:42.810]  ourselves. It's kind of perfect. I enjoy hearing different takes on the name. Like bleep face. Some
[56:42.810 --> 56:48.830]  people say bleep face. Some say F face. Some say the actual name of the show. Hearing the different
[56:48.830 --> 56:54.570]  takes, I always find interesting. I haven't told many people, if you've recommended this
[56:54.570 --> 56:59.530]  guest in person to somebody, I'd like to know what that story is. The read, like the expression
[56:59.530 --> 57:06.610]  read when telling somebody you should listen to and then name of show. Am I alone? No, I was just
[57:06.610 --> 57:10.590]  imagining that scenario. I realized that that prevented me from saying anything, but I was just
[57:10.590 --> 57:18.450]  picturing it. You guys both f***ing vanished to the point where I thought the law had once again
[57:18.450 --> 57:24.650]  won. I thought I was dealing with another law issue. I was just in the moment. Yeah, I was just
[57:24.650 --> 57:29.830]  listening to you, man. You're that interesting. Well, I would bring up another podcast for a
[57:29.830 --> 57:34.750]  moment. Gavin mentioned on the Rooster Teeth podcast that somebody he knows listened to
[57:34.750 --> 57:41.490]  a really broken episode because it was like there were talks about it being one of our best episodes.
[57:41.630 --> 57:46.850]  So it was their first experience with it. And you brought up so many great points that I didn't even
[57:46.850 --> 57:54.090]  consider where the first 10 minutes of that episode is us yelling about the law, a thing that
[57:54.090 --> 57:58.690]  we never talk about within the episode itself. You have had to have listened to the previous one
[57:58.690 --> 58:05.250]  that any context we never explained what that is. Then it transitions into a visual gag.
[58:06.010 --> 58:11.950]  Yeah, all the Jaxx car stuff, which you can't see. Then it goes into a discussion about the plane
[58:11.950 --> 58:17.610]  window where we don't explain the original scenario again. It's also a holdover from the
[58:17.610 --> 58:22.030]  week before. And he was like, this is the shittiest podcast. I don't know anything that's happening.
[58:22.350 --> 58:25.590]  I've been listening for half an hour. Nothing's happening. What are you talking about?
[58:26.110 --> 58:30.210]  It's a mess. And I never even think about that, but it's absolutely fair.
[58:30.330 --> 58:36.590]  Our quote, best podcast is probably the worst introductory podcast you could possibly submit
[58:36.590 --> 58:43.110]  unless you give a cheat sheet. We should make a cheat sheet for that podcast. Here's what you
[58:43.110 --> 58:48.990]  need to know to listen to this podcast. That's like a pop up video style cheat sheet. That's
[58:48.990 --> 58:54.470]  interesting. Also, I think that you I don't remember it was recently, I think in a podcast
[58:54.470 --> 58:59.770]  you I thought perfectly nailed it when you described this podcast as deep lore about
[58:59.770 --> 59:05.110]  nothing. I can't think of another episode that better exemplifies deep lore about nothing than
[59:05.110 --> 59:13.270]  what you just described. Yeah. Yes. It's great. I feel like if you did we even do it? I don't
[59:13.270 --> 59:18.790]  think we did. We know Gavin. Gavin, you did an intro. Awesome. Holy fuck. You did an intro.
[59:19.310 --> 59:27.710]  Hey, I bet you 10 grand I've done an intro. Wait, did we? No. Can someone check the tapes
[59:27.710 --> 59:33.690]  that we put a put a cap to that? You can't just do that now. There's no way that that's allowed.
[59:35.250 --> 59:37.950]  I now owe you a pencil and 10 grand.
[59:41.150 --> 59:45.650]  What's on the what continues to be left on the redemption docket? Are we getting the marathon
[59:45.650 --> 59:51.170]  and the pencil this year? What's happening? Marathon is is in the docket. It is it's like
[59:51.170 --> 59:55.110]  it's a thing that I honestly the thing of the marathon, I want to find a way that I can update
[59:55.110 --> 01:00:00.270]  my progress live. I feel like that'd be the most fun way to track that. And I haven't been able
[01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:05.010]  to find a device that would do that in a way that anyone could look at. Like if you could just
[01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:12.570]  pull it up like a live distance tracker. Can't you do the Strava app or one of those? I don't
[01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:16.590]  know what that is. There's like fitness apps that you can record. Yeah, let's track this. Yeah,
[01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:22.330]  we can get you. OK, well, if you can find about two bucks on a cell phone, you're going to need
[01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:26.650]  a Google account, though, so we'll need to work that out first. That is that is an issue. I want
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:33.730]  to redo Donkey Kong Country or whatever. Donkey Kong 64. Yeah. On your Android, the Donkey Kong
[01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:40.290]  guy. I know. Well, I made a face Twitch account because you and I were going to do another Halo
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:45.290]  thing and then you just never you never agreed to another level to work. Oh, right. So it left
[01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:51.730]  dormant. So I'd probably do it on that. Not Andrew, the Donkey Kong guy. What else is in the
[01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:57.970]  redemption? Is that are those the main things? Well, let me let me put this to you. You know,
[01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:04.170]  the overkill achievement in Halo 3? Yes. Did you cheat to get it? Almost certainly,
[01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:09.970]  like almost without a doubt, almost undeniably. Wow. Cheated. Yeah. Like without a doubt. But
[01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:14.710]  I'm not lying about it. That's the difference. Neither am I. But you're one of the best gamers
[01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:20.010]  I know. It would be relatively simple for you to do that. I was excited to get it because I'm me
[01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:26.730]  and an overkill is like a once a quarter occurrence to me. I think I'm trying to remember because
[01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:30.770]  there was a time I may have gotten that achievement twice. And I think the second time
[01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.630]  I guess I'll have to check. I'll check my old gamer tag to see if I got it. I think I may have
[01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:40.190]  got it legitimately on that one. But the second time I definitely would have cheated. I'm all
[01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:45.590]  about efficiency when it comes to achievements. Who cares about the legitimacy of them? You guys
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.990]  are going to talk about legitimacy when I carried you through countless destiny raids where you
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:55.210]  literally did nothing. It's a weird point. We did stuff. We shot guns. We stayed alive.
[01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.850]  We did a minor amount of damage. Yeah. Yeah. So you could respawn.
[01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.090]  We prevented a wipe by standing in a corner.
[01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:11.330]  That is true. No, look, I'll give all of destiny to you. But Halo 3, all me, baby.
[01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:16.630]  I will say we did give Gavin an opportunity to truly redeem himself because there was like a week
[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:21.130]  when this conversation happened that he could go into Halo 3 and try to get another overkill
[01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.670]  legitimately. And as far as I know, he didn't boot it up once.
[01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:28.450]  I even recommended he try that. Yeah, I just don't have a 360 handy.
[01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:33.230]  You don't need one. It's backwards compatible. Don't need one.
[01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:34.910]  Wait, what was the point of getting the 360 then?
[01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:39.430]  I don't know why he did that, but he did it. And I wasn't going to argue about it,
[01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:41.290]  but he just decided to. And I was like, that's fine.
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:45.530]  I appreciate his effort. Absolutely. Without a doubt.
[01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:49.190]  I'll get one. I'll do it. It's already blatant now.
[01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:53.550]  The servers are down. Yeah, but I could get it in Master Chief Collection.
[01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:56.350]  I don't know if that's the same. How's that not the same?
[01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:59.150]  I don't like... It's the same.
[01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:01.390]  I'm not saying... The whole reason it was... I was impressed
[01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:06.150]  the time is that the lone wolves was five. Let me clarify my point before you get mad
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:10.610]  at me further. I literally don't know if it's the same. Like, I'm not saying it isn't the same.
[01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:12.590]  It's very possible it's the same. Like it's emulation.
[01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:14.750]  But I don't know if it's... Yeah, like it's a different engine.
[01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:19.250]  Like, I don't know what the... Yeah, I'm not sure about the exact conversion of those things
[01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.690]  or if it's like a different Halo engine. That's what I'm saying.
[01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:26.070]  If you get it, I'd love to see it. Next week, I want to see an overkill
[01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:29.250]  from you and Halo in the Master Chief Collection. Damn, I'm not very good at Halo.
[01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:33.930]  Get out. You're really... You're good at Halo.
[01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:39.370]  We almost... You fucking won the race. The race we did was very competitive.
[01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:43.790]  I thought you were going to win, honestly. I got lucky, I think.
[01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:47.450]  You say you're Platinum 1 like that doesn't mean something. I'm Rubble 4.
[01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:54.990]  Like, Platinum 1 sounds amazing to me. Gloss 3.
[01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:58.930]  That's behind a paywall.
[01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:06.210]  Well, this seems like probably a place where we should stop talking now.
[01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:09.110]  We did a pretty good one there, I think. That was fun.
[01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:12.130]  Oh yeah, I liked it. Did everybody talk about everything they wanted to talk about?
[01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:18.210]  Um, I have a thing, but it's kind of tied to my email account, so I can't actually discuss it.
[01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:22.230]  Is that why you haven't heard back from Donovan?
[01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.210]  Thank God I'm emailing him on my work email.
[01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:30.810]  That would be horrendous if it was on my personal. I'd be much more upset about
[01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.910]  losing that if it was personal.
[01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:35.990]  I have a couple things that are pretty... Well, one of them is pretty long,
[01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.250]  so we'll get into it at some other point.
[01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.210]  Yeah, why don't we... Next time.
[01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:42.390]  Yeah, remind me to talk about the infinity pie. That's easy. And then Sonic branding.
[01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:49.990]  But I will say, I assume you guys saw the kids eat free on Zimday picture that came out recently.
[01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.870]  Yes. Which is maybe the greatest image I've ever seen in my entire life. Gavin,
[01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:57.670]  are you familiar with this? Let me find it.
[01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.050]  So I was trying to look into what Zimday is. From my understanding,
[01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:07.590]  every home game in the 82 season was Zimday. So I've been meaning to update my calendar to
[01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:11.290]  make sure I have every Zimday listed, so I can appropriately celebrate.
[01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:12.650]  How many Zimdays in a year?
[01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.610]  How many home games are there in a baseball season, Geoff?
[01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:21.370]  There'd be 82. So there's 82 Zimdays in a year.
[01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.190]  How many baseball games in a season total?
[01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:26.130]  164, I think, yeah.
[01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.230]  Oh my god. Are you serious?
[01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:29.050]  Here, let me put...
[01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:29.410]  Yes.
[01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.510]  Yeah, I'm going to put this in the discord.
[01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.510]  Yeah, they play a lot of baseball. Imagine having a season ticket.
[01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.830]  I mean, baseball starts...
[01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:39.730]  it starts in April and it ends in, like, at the end of October.
[01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:42.830]  But you'd be committing basically every other day of the year.
[01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:44.390]  On average.
[01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:50.310]  I like that Gavin's perspective of it being difficult is from the fan's angle, not the
[01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:55.130]  athlete. Not that, like, having to physically participate in that many games. He's like,
[01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:57.330]  how do you have the time to go watch these things?
[01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:01.390]  Well, I mean, most of the world are the fans, not the players.
[01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:02.770]  Look at that photo, Gavin.
[01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:03.830]  Don Zimmer.
[01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:10.130]  Chicken, chicken wing in one hand, bowl of chicken wing in the other, some popcorn under
[01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:16.990]  the elbow. Kids pointing at something shocking. All the kids seem shocked by what's happening
[01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:20.870]  and Zimmer's just couldn't be happier. Giant grin on his face.
[01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.410]  They're looking at different shit.
[01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:23.510]  Yeah.
[01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:30.110]  Also, it's funny to think that those kids are older than us.
[01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.030]  Oh my god.
[01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:35.690]  I wonder if we can find out who they are and ask what it was like to sit next to them.
[01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:39.950]  That's such a good idea. The next mystery to solve.
[01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:44.970]  I would have been seven. So these kids are probably in the 10 to 12 range, right?
[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.810]  So you could have been one of these kids if you were in the right place.
[01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:50.830]  I was a little young, but yeah, I guess I could have been if I'd have been a
[01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:53.490]  Texas Rangers fan back in the day and living in Texas.
[01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:54.830]  God, I want some chicken.
[01:06:56.210 --> 01:07:03.290]  It's disturbing that I can see his chair, but the kid to the right of him doesn't have one.
[01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:08.470]  It kind of has a very, like, they're in heaven vibe, which is not what you want to go for.
[01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:12.790]  It feels like they fall. This is Zimmer in heaven right now,
[01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:17.970]  eating chicken wings, laughing at Gavin, breaking his Apple II remote, covering himself in glass.
[01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:25.490]  That kid is pointing at the hole that Gavin just created in the bottom.
[01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:28.030]  Can you believe he just broke his bed down too?
[01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:35.670]  We should make sure that's side by side of the Instagram post.
[01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:42.310]  I love the idea that somewhere in heaven, Don Zimmer is sitting on white bleachers
[01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:46.330]  with a bunch of little kids eating chicken wings and just watching Gavin go through life,
[01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.070]  laughing and pointing at every interesting thing that happens.
[01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:57.170]  He ordered another record of the Zimmer- or, never mind. It was such a good setup and I just
[01:07:57.170 --> 01:08:06.130]  fucked- I sucked. No, no, I crashed the plane. I went nose first. I missed the runway. It's over.
[01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:10.930]  There's no recovering from that. I yelled the wrong name. I forgot what a record was called.
[01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:18.570]  I lifted and rolled. I've crashed several times. There's no recovery. I'm just dead. I'm dead.
[01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.930]  Cover that, f***ing idiot.
[01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:23.830]  All right, all right.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.320]  Why is that the message?
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.160]  I don't know. I just made the war on media. I'm mad at him. You just died. You just died on air.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.920]  I- Comedy just died. That bit just died on air. I feel like it should get some media coverage.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.700]  Between that and trying for five straight minutes to kill the s***.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.620]  All right, like and subscribe.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.220]  Wait, we're not done? I just stopped recording.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.160]  What?
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.940]  What do you mean we're not done?
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.320]  No, we're done. Yeah, we're done now.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:07.480]  Hey there, it's Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.300]  The boys head to Bojangles Coliseum.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.340]  Andrew loves Happy Meals.
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.240]  The guys discuss meal hacks.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.920]  The knob versus handle discussion returns.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.320]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.840]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
