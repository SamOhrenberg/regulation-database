[00:36.600 --> 00:41.580]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:41.580 --> 00:45.260]  This is the 88th iteration of this podcast.
[00:46.100 --> 00:48.080]  With me as always, my name is Geoff.
[00:48.340 --> 00:50.840]  And then with me, Gavin and Andrew.
[00:52.200 --> 00:53.240]  Take it away, boys.
[00:53.680 --> 00:56.360]  Geoff, you sound like you're in a really good mood.
[00:58.960 --> 01:00.880]  I'm doing OK. I'm doing OK.
[01:00.940 --> 01:02.060]  How are you? Good.
[01:02.400 --> 01:03.060]  I'm disappointed.
[01:03.540 --> 01:05.580]  That's how I am. I'm disappointed in Gavin.
[01:05.780 --> 01:07.580]  What? I'm very disappointed in you.
[01:07.700 --> 01:09.580]  What do you mean? You remain unpleasant.
[01:09.580 --> 01:13.200]  You are just as unpleasant as you were the previous week.
[01:13.640 --> 01:15.320]  Zero pleasantries for Gavin.
[01:15.540 --> 01:18.820]  Because I showed up at one o'clock and you showed up at one.
[01:18.940 --> 01:21.360]  Once again, we had this whole thing.
[01:21.640 --> 01:22.640]  I thought you bought in.
[01:22.760 --> 01:24.760]  I thought you're going to be a pleasant guy going forward.
[01:24.840 --> 01:25.820]  Your mood would be better.
[01:26.840 --> 01:28.220]  Still just as unpleasant.
[01:28.400 --> 01:31.280]  I'll be honest, I completely forgot about the pleasantries.
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.460]  Oh, of course you did.
[01:32.780 --> 01:34.320]  You don't value the pleasantries.
[01:34.580 --> 01:35.640]  This is well established.
[01:35.640 --> 01:39.720]  We have so many pleasantries outside of Discord.
[01:39.720 --> 01:41.840]  It's not pleasantries! That doesn't count.
[01:42.280 --> 01:45.940]  We have zero pleasantries scenarios outside of...
[01:45.940 --> 01:48.720]  There's one other thing that we could do where we have pleasantries.
[01:48.900 --> 01:52.220]  Maybe for episode 90, I'll attend the pleasantries.
[01:52.620 --> 01:54.980]  That you can't. What episode is this?
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.660]  Wait, what episode? This is 88.
[01:56.720 --> 01:59.100]  88. I thought you're doing a sneaky thing.
[01:59.180 --> 02:01.040]  I thought we're doing 89 and we're doing two today.
[02:01.060 --> 02:03.540]  And you're like, I'll be there before the start of the 90th one.
[02:04.460 --> 02:05.480]  You're already here.
[02:05.760 --> 02:07.700]  Okay, I'm going to hold you to that.
[02:08.000 --> 02:09.240]  Pleasant Gavin, episode 90.
[02:09.660 --> 02:14.020]  Why don't you give me a brief summary of today's pleasantries and what was covered and what I missed?
[02:14.080 --> 02:16.540]  Okay, we were talking about arena names.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.660]  Our favorite sports arena names.
[02:18.740 --> 02:22.260]  I guess it doesn't have to be a sports arena, although most arenas are for sports.
[02:23.160 --> 02:24.200]  We're discussing that.
[02:24.520 --> 02:25.340]  All sorts of great names.
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.540]  Do you have a favorite arena name? Either of you?
[02:27.800 --> 02:29.920]  Well, I feel a little on the spot right now, honestly.
[02:30.880 --> 02:34.460]  I haven't had time to think about all of the different arena names around the world.
[02:34.540 --> 02:35.060]  Gavin, you go.
[02:35.740 --> 02:36.900]  I don't know a lot of arena names.
[02:37.020 --> 02:42.580]  I know the ones that they made fun of in basketball, like Maxi Tampon Stadium or whatever.
[02:42.660 --> 02:44.240]  But they were all just funny jokes.
[02:44.560 --> 02:45.620]  What are some of the real ones?
[02:45.900 --> 02:46.720]  Are they funny jokes?
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.200]  Because that's how arenas are named.
[02:48.360 --> 02:52.080]  Like, I know that that's probably a joke, but it also is just sort of how they are.
[02:52.340 --> 02:52.540]  Yeah.
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.820]  My personal one was the KFC Yum Center.
[02:56.340 --> 02:58.640]  I love hearing about the KFC Yum Center in Kentucky.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.780]  It'd be like when you watch a UFC event.
[03:00.940 --> 03:04.480]  They'll be like UFC 76 at the Yum Center.
[03:04.900 --> 03:08.100]  Two heavyweights going at it like this is such a...
[03:08.100 --> 03:11.920]  Eric had a great one for I don't remember what city it was for.
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.080]  It's New Orleans and they have the Smoothie King Arena or the Smoothie King Center.
[03:17.400 --> 03:18.960]  OK, I have one.
[03:19.560 --> 03:25.400]  The Boca Raton Bowl is the RoofClaim.com Boca Raton Bowl,
[03:25.940 --> 03:27.500]  which I think is because
[03:28.360 --> 03:33.460]  so many roofs blow off in hurricanes in Florida
[03:35.300 --> 03:38.580]  that it's such a big industry that the roof company,
[03:38.820 --> 03:40.960]  the roof insurance company, sponsored an entire bowl.
[03:41.580 --> 03:43.200]  Wow, Henry's really hitting it hard today.
[03:43.600 --> 03:44.680]  Straight off the...
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.320]  It's a defiant thing.
[03:47.560 --> 03:49.520]  So the other day I was doing a different podcast.
[03:49.620 --> 03:54.020]  I think I was doing the RT podcast from home and he started up
[03:54.020 --> 03:56.480]  and I had to take the... It's not that podcast.
[03:56.720 --> 03:57.620]  They wouldn't get it, you know.
[03:57.660 --> 03:59.620]  So I had to take the football away from him.
[04:00.220 --> 04:03.520]  And so I he was pissed off.
[04:03.600 --> 04:08.220]  He has more creative freedom while he's on foot for like a day.
[04:09.080 --> 04:11.260]  And so I think that he's being defiant.
[04:11.440 --> 04:13.520]  But also he's like checking like, wait a minute.
[04:13.560 --> 04:17.040]  I thought the rule was I start squeaking when we're doing the podcast.
[04:17.160 --> 04:20.720]  And then I don't think he understands the subtleties between like different podcasts.
[04:21.120 --> 04:23.360]  And so he's kind of looking at me right now with the football in his mouth
[04:23.360 --> 04:25.420]  going like, am I doing this or not? Like, what's what?
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.380]  He has his role.
[04:29.940 --> 04:30.580]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:31.240 --> 04:33.140]  But there's no nuance to it. That's the problem.
[04:33.580 --> 04:35.740]  Maybe that will be season by season six.
[04:35.880 --> 04:37.740]  Maybe he'll have a variation of the squeak.
[04:38.000 --> 04:38.920]  It won't be constant.
[04:39.140 --> 04:41.340]  How much money does it take to get your name on a stadium?
[04:41.760 --> 04:44.260]  Like what's the shittiest, cheapest stadium you could get your name on?
[04:44.780 --> 04:46.440]  Oh, maybe the Boca Raton Bowl.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.660]  Well, how many how many seats is a stadium?
[04:51.180 --> 04:52.840]  What's the smallest stadium I can have?
[04:52.840 --> 04:57.700]  I certainly couldn't call a six chair building an arena.
[04:58.040 --> 04:59.260]  World's smallest stadium.
[04:59.580 --> 05:03.020]  Is it a capacity thing or is it just like a specific facility
[05:03.020 --> 05:05.400]  within the stadium that classifies it as a stadium?
[05:05.820 --> 05:07.660]  I don't know what defines a stadium.
[05:07.860 --> 05:10.560]  Does it need like eight food courts and then it's a stadium?
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.420]  It needs to serve at least three different variations of hot dogs
[05:16.420 --> 05:17.600]  and then it becomes a stadium.
[05:17.840 --> 05:20.160]  We should look up the requirements because we could potentially build
[05:20.160 --> 05:21.800]  a very small f*** face stadium.
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.260]  I can't get the link to work, but according to Google, Eden Park
[05:27.260 --> 05:30.600]  in New Zealand is widely considered as the smallest international
[05:30.600 --> 05:31.880]  cricket stadium in the world.
[05:31.980 --> 05:33.920]  But I don't know what the f***ing...
[05:33.920 --> 05:36.080]  Eric says a stadium is a place or venue.
[05:36.220 --> 05:39.180]  Outdoor sports concerts, other events consist of a field or stage
[05:39.180 --> 05:42.860]  either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure.
[05:43.500 --> 05:44.820]  So it just needs tiered seating.
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.060]  Yeah. Yeah, we could absolutely make a stadium.
[05:49.060 --> 05:53.120]  Yeah, because this one, this cricket stadium has a capacity of 15,000 people.
[05:53.260 --> 05:55.260]  I feel like we could come in way smaller than that.
[05:55.460 --> 05:57.520]  15? Yeah, 15 people.
[05:58.280 --> 06:01.840]  Before we get away from the names, Nick said his favorite name was the Chick-fil-A
[06:02.300 --> 06:04.420]  stadium or something like that in Atlanta.
[06:05.020 --> 06:06.360]  Is that where the Falcons play?
[06:06.800 --> 06:07.700]  Does that still exist?
[06:08.040 --> 06:09.380]  Well, the Falcons play in Atlanta.
[06:09.980 --> 06:10.960]  I know they play in Atlanta.
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.020]  I knew that part. I didn't know what their...
[06:13.900 --> 06:17.800]  So did Kanye West live in a Chick-fil-A technically for a while?
[06:17.800 --> 06:19.260]  Did he live in the stadium?
[06:19.960 --> 06:23.080]  Kanye West moved into the Falcons stadium for a little bit.
[06:23.160 --> 06:25.380]  He went through this whole thing where he's living in stadiums.
[06:25.760 --> 06:26.900]  They eventually kicked him out.
[06:27.420 --> 06:30.060]  Is that when he was doing his like his like Sunday service thing?
[06:30.720 --> 06:32.940]  No, I think like it was more recent than that.
[06:33.360 --> 06:37.060]  Oh, I assume more people were aware of Kanye West's stadium habits.
[06:37.720 --> 06:38.940]  It's like what kind of room did he have?
[06:38.980 --> 06:39.700]  Did he have like one of the...
[06:39.700 --> 06:40.980]  I don't... It's a great question.
[06:41.080 --> 06:45.000]  He moved stadiums, though, because I feel like the playoffs were starting
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.040]  in the NFL or something.
[06:46.100 --> 06:47.640]  They're like, you can't still be here.
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.460]  You got to go. I think he's working on...
[06:49.960 --> 06:52.440]  Yeah, it may have been the Sunday service stuff.
[06:52.720 --> 06:53.360]  It was recent.
[06:53.560 --> 06:55.460]  It was like within the last three or four months.
[06:55.940 --> 06:57.340]  Huh. And I don't remember where he moved.
[06:57.400 --> 06:58.540]  I think he moved to New Orleans.
[06:58.700 --> 07:02.840]  He may have went from Chick-fil-A to a smoothie king, potentially.
[07:04.140 --> 07:07.320]  Do you think that's a step up or a step down or a lateral move
[07:07.320 --> 07:08.840]  going from a Chick-fil-A to a smoothie king?
[07:09.160 --> 07:13.240]  I haven't had either, but I feel like there's a Chick-fil-A is a more...
[07:13.240 --> 07:14.120]  I don't know.
[07:15.020 --> 07:16.060]  Is Chick-fil-A more?
[07:16.380 --> 07:18.740]  Has a company ever sponsored the name of a stadium
[07:18.740 --> 07:22.100]  and then not provided the catering for the stadium?
[07:22.420 --> 07:24.800]  Like, is there a Chick-fil-A stadium that doesn't serve Chick-fil-A?
[07:25.120 --> 07:27.960]  I would be shocked if the Chick-fil-A stadium serves Chick-fil-A.
[07:28.420 --> 07:30.900]  It's certainly not on a Sunday when they play football, right?
[07:33.760 --> 07:34.980]  Isn't that the point of Chick-fil-A?
[07:35.980 --> 07:37.620]  I guess. Yeah, they're closed on Sundays.
[07:38.560 --> 07:39.840]  Are they? I've never been.
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.220]  I've never. I don't have any.
[07:41.300 --> 07:43.080]  You've never eaten at Chick-fil-A in your life?
[07:43.080 --> 07:45.080]  No, I don't have any around here.
[07:45.380 --> 07:47.400]  They got good chicken nuggets, man.
[07:47.720 --> 07:49.000]  Do they? Oh, yeah.
[07:49.260 --> 07:51.040]  Compared to like McDonald's nuggets.
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.700]  Where would you? How do you rank them?
[07:53.000 --> 07:54.860]  How do I rank Chick-fil-A nuggets?
[07:55.220 --> 07:57.460]  Yes. Amongst other fast food nuggets?
[07:57.860 --> 08:02.120]  Yes. I think they're better than all the other fast food nuggets combined.
[08:02.620 --> 08:03.800]  Oh, wow. Yeah.
[08:04.300 --> 08:06.700]  They're like it's like a different it's like a different level.
[08:07.300 --> 08:08.300]  That's such a weird phrase.
[08:08.380 --> 08:11.720]  I like the idea of all the other fast food nuggets forming into a Voltron.
[08:11.720 --> 08:15.280]  And it would not be that that Voltron nug would not compare.
[08:15.560 --> 08:20.760]  Yeah. Is a nugget only good because of the ratio of the fried part to the inside?
[08:20.860 --> 08:24.540]  Like if you had a big nugget steak, would it be less delicious?
[08:25.500 --> 08:27.540]  No. That's a chicken fried steak, right?
[08:27.600 --> 08:31.140]  Isn't isn't a chicken fried steak just a big chicken nugget?
[08:31.200 --> 08:31.960]  Oh, is that what that is?
[08:32.600 --> 08:33.500]  I don't know.
[08:35.300 --> 08:39.440]  What do you I think the most important part of the chicken nugget is the crunch for me.
[08:39.720 --> 08:41.280]  It's just it's really the coating.
[08:41.280 --> 08:43.660]  The breading. I want a nice crunch.
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.940]  I will say the I agree when it comes to like McDonald's and those like that.
[08:49.040 --> 08:50.380]  You're in it for the breading, right?
[08:50.720 --> 08:52.600]  But with Chick-fil-A, it's good all the way through.
[08:52.780 --> 08:53.280]  I will say.
[08:53.780 --> 08:56.340]  Does any nugget have the fried part on the inside?
[08:56.940 --> 08:59.760]  Oh, like like an inverted nugget.
[09:00.180 --> 09:03.260]  Yeah. Is there an in... how would you do that?
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.980]  I'm sure that's doable.
[09:06.260 --> 09:07.420]  You'd have to just you start with.
[09:07.760 --> 09:10.560]  Oh, what if you started with a tiny nug, right?
[09:10.560 --> 09:14.360]  OK, wrap, wrap that in chicken, nugged it again
[09:14.880 --> 09:18.500]  and just keep doing it until it's like a nug sphere.
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.640]  I feel like if I were to show you that product that you just created,
[09:23.800 --> 09:25.220]  you would be annoyed by it.
[09:25.540 --> 09:26.380]  You would hate it.
[09:26.500 --> 09:28.580]  The thing you just invented in your head.
[09:28.720 --> 09:30.380]  You would if I showed you a photo, you'd be like,
[09:30.400 --> 09:31.920]  who has the fucking time to do that?
[09:32.220 --> 09:34.140]  Get out of here. You would hate it.
[09:34.340 --> 09:35.580]  I love that you just invented that.
[09:35.880 --> 09:39.460]  I think I would say you, Andrew, are quite an expert in fast food
[09:39.460 --> 09:41.180]  because, you know, you've got the sauce empire.
[09:41.560 --> 09:46.940]  I do. I think you could craft a really interesting, unique fast food menu item.
[09:47.220 --> 09:48.640]  I need to think about that. You're right.
[09:48.720 --> 09:50.120]  I think I could do something in the space.
[09:50.220 --> 09:53.000]  I'm currently I feel like I'm taking down McDonald's right now.
[09:53.500 --> 09:54.300]  I learned a secret.
[09:54.880 --> 09:55.880]  It's changed my life.
[09:56.160 --> 09:56.920]  My McDonald's order.
[09:56.920 --> 09:57.960]  Are you going to reveal the secret?
[09:58.100 --> 09:59.600]  Because you are going to not reveal it.
[09:59.860 --> 10:01.020]  I'm on the fence.
[10:01.240 --> 10:03.640]  I'm on the fence about revealing it because it's so good.
[10:04.100 --> 10:06.980]  It's changed. It's changed my whole ordering process.
[10:07.240 --> 10:08.500]  You won't even tell me about it.
[10:08.500 --> 10:10.040]  Why wouldn't you want to share it?
[10:10.120 --> 10:12.140]  Why? Why would you want to hold on to this information?
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.940]  Because what if they because it's there?
[10:14.020 --> 10:15.360]  They're making a mistake, Geoff.
[10:15.740 --> 10:17.740]  The people, the McDonald's is making a mistake.
[10:18.040 --> 10:21.960]  I don't know if it's local to my specific McDonald's.
[10:22.060 --> 10:23.100]  I have a feeling it's not.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.640]  Are you worried it's going to be patched?
[10:25.700 --> 10:29.160]  I'm afraid that someone's going to go tell McDonald's what they're doing
[10:29.160 --> 10:30.120]  and it's going to get patched.
[10:30.140 --> 10:32.380]  And there's a whole other layer that I mean, I haven't talked.
[10:32.500 --> 10:34.460]  You knew that I had a new trick, Gavin.
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.860]  You don't even know the side benefit of what I'm getting.
[10:37.860 --> 10:41.220]  I'll say I'll fucking say it because everyone I've told didn't know.
[10:41.320 --> 10:41.820]  This is the thing.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.300]  McDonald's has a pancake happy meal.
[10:45.380 --> 10:47.960]  They have a hot cake happy meal for the morning.
[10:48.640 --> 10:51.560]  But you get to at least all the promotional images.
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.920]  That's what makes it like the kids meal version of the hot cakes.
[10:53.980 --> 10:55.520]  You just order hot cakes. You get three.
[10:56.060 --> 10:58.920]  If you order the kids hot cakes, you're supposed to get two.
[10:59.420 --> 11:00.680]  But they don't know this.
[11:00.880 --> 11:01.660]  They just get three.
[11:02.100 --> 11:05.360]  So I order the kids hot cakes, which comes with a drink.
[11:05.880 --> 11:07.860]  Comes with a hash brown, which is two dollars.
[11:08.920 --> 11:12.460]  And what should be two pancakes for I get three.
[11:12.580 --> 11:15.200]  So for the price of essentially one order of hot cakes,
[11:15.220 --> 11:18.760]  I'm now also getting a drink and a hash brown and a toy.
[11:19.020 --> 11:20.340]  How are you getting three? You're ordering three.
[11:20.620 --> 11:23.600]  I'm ordering two, but they just give three because I don't think anyone
[11:23.600 --> 11:25.920]  actually knows what like people don't seem to be aware
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.180]  that there is a hot cakes happy meal and nobody knows what it is.
[11:29.200 --> 11:29.920]  So they give three.
[11:30.420 --> 11:32.160]  They just give a standard order of hot cakes.
[11:32.260 --> 11:33.180]  They're only supposed to give two.
[11:33.180 --> 11:36.940]  So your secret to your secret cheat
[11:37.460 --> 11:41.340]  is you order the hot cakes, happy meal, and that's all you do.
[11:41.720 --> 11:43.700]  Well, yeah, because they give three.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.520]  They give three hot cakes instead of two.
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.820]  And they give you a toy and you get a drink and you get a hash.
[11:50.940 --> 11:54.660]  If I were to just order, if I didn't order this and happy meal, right?
[11:54.700 --> 11:56.620]  Like I was just ordering all the items of it.
[11:56.900 --> 12:00.240]  The hot cakes, the three hot cakes is like four dollars, 80 cents.
[12:00.660 --> 12:02.200]  The hash brown is two dollars.
[12:02.620 --> 12:04.320]  The drink is like another dollar.
[12:05.280 --> 12:07.600]  This is like an eight dollar meal I'm getting for five dollars.
[12:07.700 --> 12:08.600]  Plus, I get a toy.
[12:09.480 --> 12:10.640]  What's the change in my morning?
[12:11.060 --> 12:13.100]  That's a fantastic question, Geoff.
[12:13.140 --> 12:13.740]  What is the toy?
[12:13.940 --> 12:18.080]  Now, originally, right now, they're doing sing to toys is their main thing.
[12:18.180 --> 12:19.560]  Who wants that? They're not great.
[12:19.720 --> 12:20.360]  They're not great toys.
[12:20.840 --> 12:25.940]  But two times ago, I opened up my box and I got a fucking beanie, baby.
[12:26.240 --> 12:27.120]  I got a beanie, baby.
[12:27.180 --> 12:28.240]  How exciting is that?
[12:28.660 --> 12:29.640]  The whole beanie, baby.
[12:30.100 --> 12:31.620]  I got a whole beanie, baby.
[12:32.360 --> 12:35.120]  It was the greatest morning I've had in quite a while.
[12:35.220 --> 12:36.420]  It lifted my spirits.
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.600]  I was excited about it.
[12:37.880 --> 12:40.340]  Then I realized the beanie, baby was from 2019.
[12:41.060 --> 12:44.000]  That beanie, baby has just been hanging out in that McDonald's
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.460]  since since before the pandemic started.
[12:46.740 --> 12:50.220]  The world has changed since that beanie, baby was delivered.
[12:50.600 --> 12:52.600]  Do you think it's even a McDonald's beanie, baby?
[12:52.680 --> 12:55.180]  Or do you think they're at a point now where employees are just trying to get rid
[12:55.180 --> 12:56.520]  of shit they don't want in the house anymore?
[12:57.220 --> 12:59.740]  I like your idea, but I think it's a McDonald's beanie, baby.
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.220]  And I'll say I'll say why.
[13:01.220 --> 13:03.660]  Because I think they're out of sing to stuff.
[13:04.220 --> 13:06.160]  And so they're just giving away what they currently have.
[13:06.240 --> 13:07.580]  So I ordered a Happy Meal this morning.
[13:07.660 --> 13:09.440]  I got fucking Pokemon cards.
[13:09.800 --> 13:11.420]  Oh, Pokemon cards.
[13:11.700 --> 13:13.240]  A lot of people eat those now, right?
[13:13.320 --> 13:14.020]  I've been hearing that.
[13:15.060 --> 13:19.040]  I just can't imagine anything better at sucking up the fast food
[13:19.040 --> 13:21.580]  smell than the material used in a beanie, baby.
[13:21.680 --> 13:23.520]  That thing must smell terrible.
[13:23.960 --> 13:25.540]  Nice. Listen, it's in a bag.
[13:25.600 --> 13:27.340]  It's got a it's got a bag.
[13:27.400 --> 13:29.320]  Keeps all the oil stink out.
[13:29.880 --> 13:32.240]  I was going to say, it's got it's in a bag.
[13:32.360 --> 13:34.500]  It's got a beak like the beak would be.
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.140]  So if we're going to talk about things that would penetrate,
[13:38.480 --> 13:40.720]  the bag is a better option of the two.
[13:41.200 --> 13:42.500]  What is the beanie, baby?
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.340]  It's it's Gilda the Flamingo.
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.020]  Birthday, February 26, 2017.
[13:48.460 --> 13:49.240]  Gilda the Flamingo.
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.040]  I got to admit, I'm slightly let down by your McDonald's hat.
[13:53.040 --> 13:54.060]  Get the fuck out of here.
[13:54.100 --> 13:55.320]  Get out of here.
[13:55.320 --> 13:57.640]  I thought I was picturing you like on...
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.600]  I was picturing you like on the kiosk being like a like ordering on the screen being like,
[14:02.700 --> 14:06.400]  well, if you add this and then subtract this and you'd order this without the thing
[14:06.400 --> 14:07.640]  and then it comes and you get really...
[14:07.640 --> 14:10.020]  You're just ordering an item from the menu.
[14:10.560 --> 14:11.120]  That's it.
[14:11.640 --> 14:14.000]  I've noticed a hole in their system.
[14:14.180 --> 14:15.260]  I've noticed a mistake.
[14:15.600 --> 14:18.140]  It's a hole they give to everyone and don't care about, clearly.
[14:18.760 --> 14:21.040]  No, they... I think... Listen.
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.920]  Why would they ask that?
[14:23.220 --> 14:25.080]  Eric started shit. Eric said, I think your hack is good.
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.160]  No, it's a great hack because I'm saying...
[14:28.160 --> 14:28.400]  What's the hack?
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.100]  The hack, Gavin, is you get for the price of three hotcakes.
[14:33.360 --> 14:34.980]  You're not just getting a hotcake.
[14:35.160 --> 14:36.480]  I don't know how many times I have to say it.
[14:36.620 --> 14:37.480]  You're getting a hash brown.
[14:37.720 --> 14:40.600]  You're getting a drink, a delicious fucking apple juice
[14:40.600 --> 14:42.920]  or a chocolate milk or an orange juice.
[14:43.120 --> 14:44.620]  Your choice. You can make the decision.
[14:44.920 --> 14:46.240]  It's just sat on the menu.
[14:46.560 --> 14:48.560]  But it's at a cheaper price.
[14:48.960 --> 14:50.380]  It's like half the price.
[14:52.180 --> 14:53.140]  What do you want?
[14:53.140 --> 14:55.220]  What do you fucking what did you expect me to say?
[14:55.320 --> 14:59.160]  I ordered three Big Macs and a fucking Sprite, and it turns out they deliver a Porsche.
[14:59.320 --> 15:00.900]  Like, what do you want me to say?
[15:01.620 --> 15:02.680]  What's the hack?
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.200]  Well, I think that the I think the hack, if you will, comes down to your local McDonald's
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.200]  doesn't know what they're doing.
[15:09.460 --> 15:10.320]  That's what I don't know.
[15:10.580 --> 15:11.460]  That's the possibility.
[15:11.800 --> 15:13.520]  Like, can you try a different McDonald's?
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.100]  Because I looked it up on their website and it shows it even says get two hotcakes
[15:17.100 --> 15:19.640]  with your choice of apples, hash brown, yogurt or a drink.
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.620]  So they're advertising it as two on the McDonald's website.
[15:22.620 --> 15:26.720]  So I don't know that it's a hack as much as as you just have a McDonald's
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.780]  that is playing fast and loose with the rules.
[15:29.260 --> 15:32.800]  The hack is that I don't think any McDonald's knows
[15:33.280 --> 15:34.740]  that they're only supposed to give to.
[15:35.820 --> 15:39.740]  You know, any McDonald's on Earth knows, even though the website knows,
[15:40.060 --> 15:43.680]  all the marketing materials know, you think that the mistake
[15:43.680 --> 15:46.220]  that your local McDonald's is making is global.
[15:46.380 --> 15:49.360]  Well, this is a perfect thing to talk about on a podcast.
[15:49.620 --> 15:51.720]  We got plenty of opportunities for field research.
[15:51.720 --> 15:56.500]  I want to know people who order Happy Meals get the hotcakes Happy Meal.
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.800]  Let me know how many hotcakes you get.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.100]  I get it if you if it's through the course of something you already do.
[16:01.180 --> 16:05.380]  Don't go out and buy a hotcakes Happy Meal just to give the McDonald's
[16:05.380 --> 16:06.700]  corporation money just for Andrew.
[16:06.940 --> 16:10.040]  It's probably some secret like you got some sort of a secret deal
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.780]  on the back end here where you're selling McDonald's hotcakes.
[16:12.940 --> 16:15.300]  No, absolutely. I know I don't have.
[16:15.400 --> 16:17.700]  I don't own any stocks in the McDonald's company.
[16:17.800 --> 16:19.980]  I'm not an investor. I get no benefit from this.
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.780]  I did the stock market thing once and it didn't work the way I hoped it would.
[16:24.180 --> 16:24.920]  And I lost money.
[16:26.220 --> 16:27.580]  I bought Pizza Hut.
[16:27.680 --> 16:29.780]  It was during the pandemic.
[16:30.020 --> 16:33.740]  I bought. It's so stupid.
[16:34.720 --> 16:37.020]  I bought Pizza Hut, which is Yum!
[16:37.140 --> 16:38.740]  Stock, which is Pizza Hut.
[16:38.920 --> 16:40.540]  I bought a single share of Yum!
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.180]  My favorite arena, which is Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut.
[16:46.500 --> 16:49.400]  And I was like, I think they're going to I think it's going to go up today.
[16:49.400 --> 16:50.320]  I think today is a good.
[16:50.480 --> 16:52.720]  I think people are going to get lunch from them today.
[16:53.260 --> 16:54.220]  And then I sold.
[16:54.520 --> 16:57.100]  As soon as I bought it, it tanked and went down.
[16:57.280 --> 17:00.520]  Then it went back to where I bought it after maybe two hours.
[17:00.540 --> 17:04.580]  And then I sold and I lost money on the transactional fees of the process.
[17:04.820 --> 17:05.700]  Hard to be a day trader.
[17:06.060 --> 17:07.440]  It is. I got out of the game.
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.760]  So I don't own any McDonald's stocks.
[17:08.860 --> 17:10.020]  I have no incentive to do so.
[17:10.080 --> 17:11.720]  I'd just be curious because you're right.
[17:11.740 --> 17:13.360]  I don't know that that is the argument.
[17:13.540 --> 17:17.620]  I'm like fucking Gavin's dumb argument of it not being a hack in any way.
[17:18.580 --> 17:21.940]  Expecting a fucking rainbow of gold to appear.
[17:22.220 --> 17:24.980]  If you order six things in a certain way.
[17:26.480 --> 17:28.020]  Someone's got to be on my side about this.
[17:28.220 --> 17:29.400]  No, no, I hear what you're saying.
[17:29.800 --> 17:32.440]  I have the reverse of that where I can't order Nick.
[17:32.920 --> 17:33.760]  Yes, Nick.
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.380]  What is what is Nick?
[17:35.400 --> 17:36.980]  I'm on your side, Gavin.
[17:37.240 --> 17:40.880]  Yeah, I thought I thought it was pretty clear that Geoff was on your side.
[17:41.020 --> 17:42.020]  I'm right there with you.
[17:42.600 --> 17:44.440]  Wait. Oh, this is a minor.
[17:44.560 --> 17:46.680]  I thought Geoff was with me. Why was I with you?
[17:46.680 --> 17:47.620]  I thought Geoff was with you.
[17:48.080 --> 17:51.060]  I thought you you seemed more supportive.
[17:51.380 --> 17:53.380]  You're killing our argument. You're supportive of the hack.
[17:53.760 --> 17:56.720]  Yeah, I thought you were like, I don't think it's a hack.
[17:56.820 --> 17:59.560]  I'm saying I think that your McDonald's doesn't know what the fuck they're doing.
[17:59.900 --> 18:03.860]  That's possible. OK, well, how did you get anything other than that?
[18:03.860 --> 18:05.980]  Out of what I said? Eric, please back me up.
[18:06.320 --> 18:08.580]  I didn't hear you dismiss it as a hack.
[18:08.900 --> 18:12.340]  I just I immediately it was Geoff going, well, it sounds like your McDonald's
[18:12.340 --> 18:14.800]  just doesn't understand or did something.
[18:15.260 --> 18:16.900]  This is right. This is it.
[18:16.920 --> 18:19.540]  It was him saying it's not a hack without saying the words.
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.500]  I also said, like, this would mean that every McDonald's on the globe
[18:23.500 --> 18:25.700]  is doing it wrong, and I don't think that's the case.
[18:25.800 --> 18:28.740]  And then Andrew was like, this is my backdoor opportunity
[18:28.740 --> 18:30.100]  to sell some fucking hotcakes.
[18:30.280 --> 18:34.460]  And, you know, I'm sure you get some sort of a vig on the back end for McDonald's.
[18:34.560 --> 18:39.400]  Nope. I was just your it was you did it politely, Geoff.
[18:39.720 --> 18:42.300]  All right. I apologize. I misunderstood the support.
[18:42.300 --> 18:47.180]  You broke my heart softly with it, where Gavin was just like, this isn't.
[18:47.200 --> 18:51.280]  I just don't. Sometimes I thought, Geoff, you're like, this could be a good hack,
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.740]  but it's not a hack.
[18:52.920 --> 18:56.880]  Now it raises the question that I ask myself all the time, which is,
[18:56.900 --> 18:58.380]  why do I talk?
[19:00.520 --> 19:02.480]  Just generally like it.
[19:02.560 --> 19:06.020]  There's like a 40% chance Gavin's listening to anything I say.
[19:06.180 --> 19:09.240]  Oh, and I would give Andrew like a 70%.
[19:09.240 --> 19:12.120]  But even if I if you guys are listening and everything
[19:12.120 --> 19:14.340]  I say is misconstrued anyway, then just what's the point?
[19:14.700 --> 19:16.560]  I might as well just sit back and enjoy the podcast.
[19:17.300 --> 19:19.800]  I it's I feel the same way a lot of the time.
[19:20.180 --> 19:21.420]  Not necessarily. No, you can't.
[19:21.420 --> 19:22.820]  You can't feel the same way. I already feel that way.
[19:22.880 --> 19:24.220]  That's why you can't feel my feelings.
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.100]  No, I'm stealing your feelings. I feel that.
[19:26.220 --> 19:28.440]  You can't be a feeling appropriator. How dare you?
[19:28.760 --> 19:30.080]  I'm stealing your feelings.
[19:30.560 --> 19:31.680]  They're my my insight.
[19:34.260 --> 19:35.120]  What about you, Gavin?
[19:35.740 --> 19:36.440]  What about me?
[19:37.300 --> 19:37.860]  Well, what do you mean?
[19:37.860 --> 19:38.760]  What do you mean by that?
[19:38.900 --> 19:42.080]  In reference to I just stole Geoff's feelings.
[19:42.540 --> 19:43.460]  What about me?
[19:44.280 --> 19:45.740]  Gavin, why are you in a bad mood today?
[19:46.680 --> 19:48.060]  He's always in a bad mood.
[19:48.480 --> 19:50.960]  No. I would say.
[19:51.900 --> 19:53.400]  Yeah, I do try and listen.
[19:53.540 --> 19:53.940]  I was just.
[19:55.060 --> 19:58.240]  I think I was still just thinking, I was still just thinking about
[19:58.780 --> 20:02.660]  how it's so easy to hack McDonald's because they have those screens
[20:02.660 --> 20:05.640]  where you can like deduct and add different things to different foods
[20:05.640 --> 20:07.540]  and sometimes you end up with like a negative balance.
[20:07.860 --> 20:09.100]  I got no, I got that.
[20:10.000 --> 20:13.100]  I got that. But the other way, they're fucking me on the sausage.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.020]  It's upsetting to me.
[20:15.240 --> 20:17.640]  I can't. I can't just order.
[20:17.780 --> 20:20.400]  I like a side of sausage with the hotcakes, right?
[20:20.540 --> 20:21.600]  It's a thing I enjoy.
[20:21.960 --> 20:26.980]  I can't. There's no ability for me to order just a side of sausage through the app.
[20:27.260 --> 20:28.700]  Oh, it has to come in.
[20:28.720 --> 20:31.060]  An English muffin is the best I can do to get.
[20:31.140 --> 20:32.140]  But you don't want the bread part.
[20:32.180 --> 20:33.580]  It's cheese in the bread part.
[20:33.680 --> 20:37.640]  And in that screen, I can add an additional sausage
[20:37.640 --> 20:39.100]  for a dollar twenty five.
[20:39.340 --> 20:42.880]  So I know how much it costs to order one and I can do it.
[20:42.940 --> 20:44.200]  But I need the bread part.
[20:44.280 --> 20:47.020]  So if I wanted to just sausages,
[20:47.520 --> 20:51.420]  I'd have to order one hotcake or not the English muffin
[20:51.420 --> 20:52.740]  and then an additional.
[20:53.100 --> 20:56.900]  But the math doesn't even work out because you can also order a piece of cheese
[20:56.900 --> 21:01.320]  and an English muffin and it costs more to do that than it would.
[21:01.620 --> 21:03.060]  None of it makes sense. It's chaos.
[21:03.640 --> 21:04.360]  What is your goal?
[21:04.360 --> 21:08.480]  Is your goal to save money mainly or is your goal to get one over on McDonald's?
[21:08.920 --> 21:13.180]  Well, it's started to save money and it ended up being I'm getting one over
[21:13.180 --> 21:15.040]  on McDonald's because I'm paying.
[21:15.420 --> 21:17.960]  I'm paying way less than I should be for what I'm getting.
[21:18.340 --> 21:19.400]  So it's a double win.
[21:19.780 --> 21:23.640]  Imagine the joy, Gavin, of thinking you're getting two hotcakes and you get three.
[21:24.100 --> 21:26.560]  And I'm thinking it's a mistake that would happen once.
[21:26.560 --> 21:27.680]  And it's happened every time.
[21:27.920 --> 21:29.220]  Nick asked how many times I've done it.
[21:29.260 --> 21:31.080]  I've done it about four or five times at this point.
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.660]  I was and it's 100 percent consistency with your hack.
[21:33.660 --> 21:36.500]  A hundred percent consistency.
[21:36.900 --> 21:39.220]  And the toy is changing every time.
[21:39.720 --> 21:41.140]  I don't even know it's going to be in that box.
[21:41.180 --> 21:45.100]  It's a mystery box every morning that I thought they did away with toys.
[21:45.620 --> 21:47.340]  And now you can get a book, too.
[21:47.400 --> 21:48.800]  But like, why would I fucking?
[21:49.120 --> 21:50.860]  Yeah, who can read? Yeah.
[21:52.740 --> 21:54.580]  Interesting. I don't even know why I speak.
[21:54.860 --> 21:56.180]  Completely regret learning how to read.
[21:57.440 --> 21:58.180]  Oh, yeah.
[21:58.540 --> 22:01.220]  Well, congratulations on your hotcake hack.
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.600]  Thanks. I think it's great.
[22:02.600 --> 22:05.400]  That's it. That doesn't sound anything like a hack to me.
[22:05.480 --> 22:07.260]  But let me be clear.
[22:07.960 --> 22:09.120]  Don't think it's a hack.
[22:09.220 --> 22:13.360]  OK, well, if people order this that are based on your words,
[22:13.440 --> 22:19.100]  if people who are ordering hotcakes naturally decide to order the Happy Meal,
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.280]  at what percentage do those need to come back with three for you to accept this
[22:23.280 --> 22:23.760]  as a hack?
[22:24.400 --> 22:25.720]  Nick says once is a mistake.
[22:25.780 --> 22:27.120]  Four or five times is a hack.
[22:27.180 --> 22:29.640]  I disagree. Four or five times is just a pattern.
[22:29.640 --> 22:32.260]  It's just a pattern of of
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.380]  miscommunication and poor workmanship.
[22:35.480 --> 22:38.220]  I think it's just an uneducated workforce that doesn't understand.
[22:38.500 --> 22:40.280]  I just feel like what time?
[22:40.760 --> 22:42.460]  OK, it's 1123 your time.
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.140]  I'm blown away that you're only fucking.
[22:44.360 --> 22:45.860]  OK, are you saying this is a hack?
[22:46.080 --> 22:48.040]  You're saying this is such a good hack.
[22:48.280 --> 22:49.360]  No, no, no, no, no.
[22:49.380 --> 22:52.520]  Discuss it publicly or tell me privately while we're playing.
[22:53.180 --> 22:56.080]  Because he's scared McDonald's will plug this hole.
[22:56.400 --> 22:57.240]  Wait a second.
[22:57.240 --> 23:00.560]  They're like somebody at corporate's like, what do you mean we're giving away
[23:00.560 --> 23:01.680]  an extra free hot cake?
[23:01.880 --> 23:02.700]  That's my fear.
[23:02.900 --> 23:04.400]  There's only two in the picture.
[23:05.060 --> 23:10.260]  They're going to put a press release out that needs to only be to ruin everything.
[23:10.480 --> 23:13.700]  I put a lot of the line here and I didn't shit on for it.
[23:14.300 --> 23:14.900]  God damn.
[23:16.620 --> 23:18.320]  Not even a secret menu item.
[23:18.960 --> 23:20.300]  No. Well, it's a secret.
[23:20.400 --> 23:21.020]  You get three.
[23:21.620 --> 23:24.480]  If you would look at the fucking photo, you would not know
[23:24.480 --> 23:25.500]  you're getting three hot cakes.
[23:25.600 --> 23:27.000]  I just gave you a little bit of a secret.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.940]  I don't cross reference a lot of food I get with the picture.
[23:30.220 --> 23:31.680]  Yeah, I don't. I guess that's fair.
[23:31.760 --> 23:34.880]  I'm just saying if you saw it, I may have been hacking my entire life
[23:34.880 --> 23:35.460]  without knowing.
[23:35.880 --> 23:39.680]  I, uh, I will say that the McDonald's that I frequent kind of some
[23:39.680 --> 23:40.940]  but kind of close to my house,
[23:42.200 --> 23:45.380]  they've been going through some staffing problems, which I think a lot of
[23:45.380 --> 23:48.480]  just a lot of establishments across the America have, honestly.
[23:49.460 --> 23:53.660]  But since then, it's kind of a crapshoot what I get when I order something
[23:53.660 --> 23:55.100]  like they're very routinely.
[23:55.100 --> 23:58.340]  Do I order like a number one and end up with like
[23:58.340 --> 24:02.000]  somebody else's crispy chicken sandwich or an extra fry?
[24:02.220 --> 24:03.500]  I don't consider it a hack.
[24:03.640 --> 24:05.640]  I consider it as a mistake.
[24:05.920 --> 24:08.800]  And I feel like I feel like that's what you're dealing with here.
[24:09.240 --> 24:13.220]  I think Nick made a great argument of if it's consistently the same thing.
[24:13.280 --> 24:14.340]  I think that's not a mistake.
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.240]  I see what you're saying.
[24:15.300 --> 24:16.040]  I think it's just misinformation.
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.820]  I think the only argument I will accept is if it's just my McDonald's
[24:20.820 --> 24:23.800]  failing at their job, then it's no longer a hack.
[24:24.020 --> 24:25.680]  That's that's like a shareable thing.
[24:25.840 --> 24:29.400]  OK, that's really the deciding factor for me.
[24:29.980 --> 24:32.460]  Well, Eric and Nick both think it's a hack now.
[24:32.780 --> 24:37.480]  You know what? Hey, Gavin, you asked me what my cool fucking my ridiculous item
[24:37.480 --> 24:40.760]  would be. It's ordering two hotcakes and getting four.
[24:40.980 --> 24:42.300]  That's my fucking cool item.
[24:42.480 --> 24:46.960]  Because getting an unexpected amount of hot cake, it's called the hacker meal.
[24:47.140 --> 24:49.100]  Now you get four fucking hot cakes.
[24:49.100 --> 24:50.360]  We're following sock logic.
[24:50.560 --> 24:51.840]  Is that one spare or two?
[24:53.080 --> 24:56.660]  Uh, that's one spare from a standard hot cake order for.
[24:56.880 --> 24:58.060]  Yeah. Get one extra.
[24:58.300 --> 24:59.500]  Good. That's on us.
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.760]  We mentioned a birthday during that.
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.980]  And I don't remember when or why someone's birthday was mentioned at some point.
[25:09.080 --> 25:12.120]  I feel like we need to call out that it was Don Zimmer's birthday a few days ago.
[25:12.340 --> 25:14.080]  Oh, yeah. Monday, it was Don Zimmer's birthday.
[25:14.340 --> 25:15.380]  Happy birthday to Don Zimmer.
[25:15.460 --> 25:16.340]  How old would he have been?
[25:16.880 --> 25:18.040]  Oh, that's a great question.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.940]  No, I know it's a great question.
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.300]  And I want it to be known that I fucking have learned from my.
[25:24.680 --> 25:25.700]  What was? Oh, fuck.
[25:26.040 --> 25:27.200]  Oh, what was her name?
[25:27.480 --> 25:28.940]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[25:28.960 --> 25:29.820]  I haven't learned anything.
[25:29.860 --> 25:31.700]  Apparently. Was it Leona Waddell?
[25:32.200 --> 25:33.620]  Was that her name? The Basket Woman?
[25:33.820 --> 25:35.180]  The Basket Woman. Yeah.
[25:35.300 --> 25:39.320]  Yeah. I had in my notes to bring up Zimmer's birthday happening.
[25:39.520 --> 25:42.200]  And I knew that there would be a follow up question before that.
[25:42.260 --> 25:43.360]  I wasn't prepared last time.
[25:43.420 --> 25:44.760]  I believe Zimmer would be 92.
[25:45.220 --> 25:49.520]  Oh, man. We've got to do a blowout for his century.
[25:50.220 --> 25:50.960]  We do. We really should.
[25:51.420 --> 25:52.620]  We really should. 91.
[25:52.780 --> 25:53.320]  I was close.
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.040]  Do you guys think everybody associated with this podcast will be alive in eight years?
[25:58.500 --> 25:59.940]  Oh, we could try.
[26:00.160 --> 26:01.000]  We can make a good effort.
[26:01.960 --> 26:03.460]  I don't want to end this road.
[26:03.700 --> 26:06.320]  Yeah. Well, I will certainly endeavor to be alive.
[26:06.780 --> 26:08.420]  Eric said no, but he won't say who.
[26:08.540 --> 26:10.020]  I'm kind of I kind of right there with you.
[26:10.460 --> 26:13.220]  Oh, if everybody fucking starts getting three hotcakes,
[26:13.220 --> 26:14.760]  you know who took me out.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.820]  You know who came from Ronald McDonald is a menace.
[26:19.140 --> 26:20.660]  Is he still around, Ronald?
[26:20.880 --> 26:21.860]  No, he's gone.
[26:22.080 --> 26:23.540]  Oh, like his caboose.
[26:23.600 --> 26:25.940]  It's been stolen. It's no longer.
[26:26.280 --> 26:28.240]  They've gotten rid of all traces of Ronald McDonald.
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.860]  This is I want to say I'm I'm happy that this episode the last.
[26:33.140 --> 26:38.140]  So we have we have an intern listening for this episode that came with Eric.
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.400]  This has happened once before.
[26:39.480 --> 26:40.960]  Do you remember the last time this happened?
[26:40.960 --> 26:42.780]  That we had an intern listening as we were.
[26:42.820 --> 26:44.240]  Yes. Was it the.
[26:44.820 --> 26:46.740]  I bet you do. I sure do.
[26:47.180 --> 26:48.280]  Was it the condiments?
[26:48.620 --> 26:50.460]  It was the condiment episode.
[26:50.620 --> 26:53.020]  I feel like we have enough distance where we could talk about the condiment.
[26:53.640 --> 27:00.220]  It was by far our condiment argument is not just within the context of the show.
[27:00.380 --> 27:04.240]  The most argumentative, heated, uncomfortable conversation
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.040]  I've ever had with Geoff by far in our friendship, I'd say as a whole
[27:08.040 --> 27:09.020]  between all of us.
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.600]  It was the worst conversation we've ever had.
[27:12.960 --> 27:14.300]  And it was recorded.
[27:15.060 --> 27:19.100]  And as bad, I feel like it probably sounded bad in the edited release.
[27:19.240 --> 27:22.840]  It was unbelievably worse in the moment.
[27:23.040 --> 27:24.180]  Here's the problem.
[27:24.480 --> 27:27.000]  When I get mad. Yeah.
[27:28.160 --> 27:31.360]  So it was edited in such a way that didn't.
[27:32.200 --> 27:35.700]  It was edited in such a way that I agree with, by the way,
[27:35.700 --> 27:40.060]  that I fully support that took that took away a lot of my arguments
[27:40.060 --> 27:41.660]  that I think made my point.
[27:42.040 --> 27:47.100]  But unfortunately, I made them in such a mean way that they needed to be removed.
[27:47.400 --> 27:53.260]  I guess I think you guys understand what I'm saying here, right?
[27:53.720 --> 27:55.600]  No. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was there.
[27:55.900 --> 27:57.020]  I think I was right.
[27:57.160 --> 28:03.400]  But I was right in such a such an angry, angry way that as Nick is saying,
[28:03.420 --> 28:05.260]  it took a lot of context away from me.
[28:05.260 --> 28:06.920]  Yeah, I shy.
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.240]  I really faced myself in being improving my point in the moment,
[28:11.360 --> 28:13.740]  but proving it in such a cruel way that we had to cut it.
[28:14.020 --> 28:18.260]  I feel like you definitely proved that condiments and what is the sauce
[28:18.260 --> 28:20.040]  and what is it is a fucking impossible.
[28:20.720 --> 28:22.000]  There's no good answer.
[28:22.280 --> 28:23.080]  There's going to be like this.
[28:23.240 --> 28:25.260]  I feel like it's so hard to make a judgment.
[28:25.620 --> 28:27.480]  I would say it was more of a condiment hack.
[28:30.540 --> 28:32.560]  Nick said it took away.
[28:32.780 --> 28:34.640]  It absolutely took away context from Geoff.
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.600]  If I could have had you retake those lines, it would have worked.
[28:37.960 --> 28:42.720]  I would love a version where you're like really, really agitated.
[28:43.100 --> 28:46.620]  But all the lines you ADR are like really upbeat and jolly.
[28:46.820 --> 28:49.960]  I just cut in amongst the the sour saltiness.
[28:50.680 --> 28:53.000]  I was a whole thing where I didn't realize that you were.
[28:53.180 --> 28:54.500]  It was whatever.
[28:54.760 --> 28:57.720]  It was the worst thing, the worst conversation we've ever had.
[28:57.880 --> 29:00.040]  And it was recorded on a podcast.
[29:00.220 --> 29:01.480]  And it was a weird argument.
[29:01.600 --> 29:03.580]  And it was in front of an intern.
[29:03.580 --> 29:07.100]  It was the only it's the closest thing we've had to a live audience
[29:07.100 --> 29:09.940]  that wasn't like regularly part of the show.
[29:10.200 --> 29:14.660]  And that was the only thing I said they've heard for it's just the worst.
[29:14.780 --> 29:16.920]  He didn't realize I was angry because I was still making jokes
[29:16.920 --> 29:20.780]  because that's how I deal with everything is, is, you know, anger, sadness,
[29:21.500 --> 29:22.740]  whatever, through comedy.
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.720]  But so I was still making jokes.
[29:27.060 --> 29:29.540]  You were a furnace of rage.
[29:29.760 --> 29:31.320]  And I didn't understand that.
[29:31.320 --> 29:34.300]  And I kept throwing coal in because I thought that we were doing a bit
[29:34.300 --> 29:35.840]  when we were no longer doing a bit.
[29:36.020 --> 29:37.500]  So it was equally my fault.
[29:37.500 --> 29:39.940]  You were throwing coal in and it was somehow coming out as gold,
[29:40.080 --> 29:42.080]  but like damaging the furnace as it was happening.
[29:42.500 --> 29:44.920]  Yeah, it was. I agree. It was gold.
[29:45.020 --> 29:48.440]  I feel like I was very funny in all that shit that got cut.
[29:48.560 --> 29:50.620]  It's just unfortunately the audience can't hear it.
[29:50.680 --> 29:51.460]  But I was hilarious.
[29:51.580 --> 29:53.560]  I was making myself laugh as I was furious.
[29:53.720 --> 29:56.320]  Is it a type of thing that we could put out eventually?
[29:56.700 --> 29:58.880]  Like maybe on Don's 100th birthday?
[29:59.240 --> 30:00.760]  So that it was miserable.
[30:00.760 --> 30:02.040]  I want it. We're not.
[30:02.100 --> 30:03.620]  We're not going to glorify it.
[30:03.720 --> 30:07.280]  I say we do a vinyl release on the 100th birthday of Don Zimmer.
[30:09.100 --> 30:11.320]  A vinyl of the most uncomfortable.
[30:12.100 --> 30:13.260]  Not at all fun.
[30:13.680 --> 30:14.840]  In eight years, Eric.
[30:15.320 --> 30:16.700]  What, you want to nine years? Yeah.
[30:16.900 --> 30:19.300]  What do you want to stop this podcast earlier than that, Eric?
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.640]  What what year?
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.920]  So what we're doing the vinyl in eight years?
[30:23.580 --> 30:25.840]  Well, I think it's nine years because Zimmer's only 91.
[30:26.420 --> 30:28.220]  OK, nine years.
[30:28.220 --> 30:32.420]  One of us, one of us will be dead also, apparently by the time this releases,
[30:32.600 --> 30:35.760]  one of us will be gone, but we will get the vinyl a year later.
[30:35.980 --> 30:38.780]  Yeah. I mean, we don't need three of us to put out a vinyl.
[30:39.120 --> 30:40.060]  Well, that's a good question.
[30:40.320 --> 30:45.040]  So I always assumed that when one of us dies, we'll stop the podcast
[30:45.600 --> 30:47.620]  because I wouldn't want to continue without all of us.
[30:48.020 --> 30:53.200]  But will we still continue to release posthumous merch?
[30:54.360 --> 30:58.080]  Like if one of us dies three years from now, do we just show up back on the scene
[30:58.080 --> 30:59.000]  and nine years later?
[31:00.020 --> 31:01.460]  Nick, can you please save?
[31:01.900 --> 31:05.100]  Could you put all of the edited out audio in its own folder
[31:05.100 --> 31:07.220]  and we'll release like posthumous albums?
[31:10.180 --> 31:11.360]  None of it makes sense.
[31:11.420 --> 31:12.260]  It's just all bad.
[31:12.700 --> 31:15.920]  It's just all terrible, uncomfortable pauses.
[31:16.200 --> 31:17.280]  It's just silence.
[31:17.760 --> 31:19.320]  The sound, we could call it the sound of silence.
[31:19.680 --> 31:23.340]  I think it really annoys audiophiles if you say a vinyl.
[31:23.720 --> 31:25.380]  I think that's the incorrect terminology, isn't it?
[31:25.500 --> 31:27.540]  Put out a record, put it out on vinyl.
[31:27.540 --> 31:28.680]  What's the correct?
[31:28.820 --> 31:29.560]  I don't know what I'm saying.
[31:30.080 --> 31:31.160]  I don't know what I'm saying.
[31:31.460 --> 31:32.880]  You can't buy vinyls, right?
[31:33.380 --> 31:35.960]  You buy records or you buy stuff on vinyl.
[31:36.300 --> 31:38.220]  Gavin has never wished that he didn't speak more.
[31:38.580 --> 31:39.640]  I wish I'd never spoken.
[31:41.360 --> 31:42.640]  Yeah, you tell us, expert.
[31:42.760 --> 31:43.820]  You're the one with all the records.
[31:44.060 --> 31:44.640]  Got a fair few.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.960]  You got, you got, you got three of everything, right?
[31:48.240 --> 31:48.840]  Remember how you roll?
[31:49.280 --> 31:50.300]  Got three insides.
[31:55.460 --> 31:59.160]  If you sell stuff online, you're definitely in the right business.
[31:59.160 --> 32:02.020]  More people are shopping online than ever.
[32:02.360 --> 32:04.420]  I spend 90% of my time shopping.
[32:04.740 --> 32:10.720]  90% of the stuff I buy is online, whether it be baseball cards or clothes or candy.
[32:10.960 --> 32:12.860]  They have been buying a lot of candy online lately.
[32:13.180 --> 32:18.280]  That means a lot of orders are coming in and a lot of orders you'll need to ship out fast.
[32:18.560 --> 32:22.340]  That's why online sellers like you need ShipStation.
[32:22.520 --> 32:27.960]  No matter how much you sell, ShipStation makes it super easy to manage and ship all of your orders
[32:27.960 --> 32:32.300]  from all of your sales channels faster, cheaper, and more efficiently.
[32:32.520 --> 32:38.320]  They call that the AFCE is the acronym AFCE.
[32:38.480 --> 32:42.940]  It's All Faster, Cheaper, Efficient.
[32:43.360 --> 32:44.540]  The AFCE.
[32:45.180 --> 32:49.600]  With ShipStation, you can import orders from any sales channel, ship with any carrier.
[32:49.660 --> 32:52.180]  Well, a sales channel that you maintain, I would assume.
[32:52.280 --> 32:55.040]  I wouldn't think you'd have access to other people's sales channels for their businesses.
[32:55.600 --> 32:57.000]  You could ship with any carrier.
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.420]  You can access discounted shipping rates.
[32:59.600 --> 33:00.100]  Cha-ching.
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.200]  That's where the real savings are.
[33:01.480 --> 33:04.040]  You can automate just about any shipping task.
[33:04.220 --> 33:08.080]  You'll spend a lot less time on shipping and a lot more time growing your business.
[33:08.380 --> 33:14.020]  No matter where you're selling, Amazon, Etsy, your own website, I recommend that.
[33:14.320 --> 33:20.400]  ShipStation funnels all of your orders into one simple interface that you can manage from anywhere, even your cell phone.
[33:20.400 --> 33:28.680]  I wish we had solutions like ShipStation back in 2003 when we started Rooster Teeth and we were selling DVDs and T-shirts out of my spare bedroom.
[33:28.960 --> 33:36.440]  And we were loading up the back of Bernie's truck and driving around to filling up mailboxes all over town because we didn't have the technology didn't exist yet.
[33:36.720 --> 33:43.320]  If we'd had a ShipStation, honestly, if we'd had ShipStation back then, who knows how much more successful Rooster Teeth could could be today?
[33:43.680 --> 33:45.080]  We'll never know, unfortunately.
[33:45.560 --> 33:50.120]  But luckily, you won't be forced to make the same inefficient mistakes that we did.
[33:50.120 --> 33:51.920]  Because you have ShipStation available to you.
[33:52.220 --> 33:55.360]  You'll even get access to amazing discounts with other major carriers.
[33:55.520 --> 33:57.160]  I chaching this earlier.
[33:57.560 --> 33:59.180]  UPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.
[33:59.580 --> 34:04.720]  You'll easily be able to compare carriers and choose which solution is best for you every time.
[34:05.340 --> 34:10.480]  It's no wonder ShipStation has more five star reviews than any other shipping software.
[34:11.280 --> 34:12.860]  Ship more in less time.
[34:13.020 --> 34:16.740]  Just use my offer code FACE to get a 60 day free trial.
[34:16.740 --> 34:19.980]  That's two months free of no hassle, stress free shipping.

[34:31.020 --> 34:34.800]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp Online Therapy.
[34:34.960 --> 34:36.800]  We talk about BetterHelp a lot on this show.
[34:36.900 --> 34:40.780]  And this month we are discussing some of the stigmas around mental health.
[34:41.280 --> 34:45.240]  I'm Gen X. And I know for my generation, a lot of people think therapy.
[34:45.920 --> 34:51.080]  I'm Gen X, so maybe a little older than the target demographic of this podcast.
[34:51.080 --> 34:58.380]  But I know that most people of my generation were raised thinking that therapy was for so-called crazy people.
[34:58.700 --> 34:59.660]  But that's not true.
[34:59.980 --> 35:01.760]  Therapy doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.180]  It means that you recognize that all humans have emotions and that we need to learn to control them, not avoid them.
[35:07.280 --> 35:11.500]  Which was not something that was taught to us widely back when I was younger.
[35:11.920 --> 35:14.920]  And we've been taught that mental health shouldn't be a part of normal life.
[35:14.920 --> 35:15.940]  But that's wrong, too.
[35:16.140 --> 35:19.280]  We take care of our bodies with the gym, the doctor, and nutrition.
[35:19.620 --> 35:22.980]  We should be focusing on our minds just as much.
[35:23.500 --> 35:32.100]  I've been in therapy now off and on for most of my adult life, but for a solid clip the last five or six years, though.
[35:32.500 --> 35:35.060]  And it has helped me transform myself.
[35:35.200 --> 35:44.780]  It's helped me overcome a lot of limitations that I've had, helped me understand myself a little bit better, understand some of my impulses and urges.
[35:45.440 --> 35:55.600]  Know when to spot the beginnings of unhealthy behavior patterns for me and be cognizant of that and be able to do something about it in the moment.
[35:55.740 --> 35:58.680]  It is it is actually it's it's revolutionized my mental health.
[35:59.280 --> 36:03.060]  And I can say that with one hundred percent honesty.
[36:03.620 --> 36:09.880]  BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone and even live chat sessions with your therapist.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.600]  So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[36:12.600 --> 36:17.640]  It is much more affordable than in-person therapy, and you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.
[36:18.060 --> 36:22.900]  Give it a try and see why more than two million people have used BetterHelp online therapy.
[36:23.340 --> 36:30.220]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp and Face listeners get 10 percent off their first month at BetterHelp dot com slash face.
[36:30.400 --> 36:33.400]  That's BetterHelp dot com slash face.
[36:33.760 --> 36:39.480]  That's B-E-T-T-E-R-H-E-L-P dot com slash face.
[36:42.480 --> 36:51.480]  Speaking of things that that, like, just I don't know what you're saying, you know, like I just said, what a fucking I'm having a bad day.
[36:51.640 --> 36:52.780]  I've had a bad talk.
[36:52.980 --> 36:54.480]  No, not like actual bad.
[36:54.760 --> 36:56.620]  My my communication is terrible today.
[36:56.860 --> 37:04.180]  Why did you text me, by the way, yesterday saying, oh, no, I dropped the gun.
[37:04.240 --> 37:05.000]  I don't know what you're talking.
[37:05.080 --> 37:06.020]  I don't know what you said to me.
[37:06.020 --> 37:09.860]  I didn't. I was scared to reply to it.
[37:09.920 --> 37:12.120]  I was like, this is some sort of setup.
[37:12.360 --> 37:13.980]  I'm I can only mess this up.
[37:14.020 --> 37:14.720]  I just ignored it.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  Well, people understand why in the future.
[37:18.480 --> 37:19.440]  OK, I texted you.
[37:19.480 --> 37:20.240]  Jingle, jingle, jingle.
[37:20.320 --> 37:23.980]  Because I was doing something and it related to the thing I was doing.
[37:24.060 --> 37:25.600]  And I expected you to reply.
[37:25.720 --> 37:26.540]  But then you didn't.
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.240]  And the longer you didn't, the more weird the text felt.
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.860]  Honestly, I read the text and usually I'm I'm usually excited to see a text from you.
[37:34.860 --> 37:39.060]  It's like there are certain people in my contacts where if I get a text, I'm excited.
[37:39.640 --> 37:41.240]  Geoff and Andrew, both on those lists.
[37:41.400 --> 37:43.400]  You sent me jingle, jingle, jingle.
[37:43.580 --> 37:45.040]  And I was filled with dread.
[37:45.140 --> 37:46.640]  I was like, what does this mean for me?
[37:46.720 --> 37:47.420]  I'm so sorry.
[37:47.480 --> 37:50.440]  I was like, oh, sorry, I'm I'm getting played somehow.
[37:50.600 --> 37:51.740]  I'm going to respond to this wrong.
[37:51.900 --> 37:52.860]  I just couldn't deal with it.
[37:53.040 --> 37:54.940]  I just had to stare at it and be like, oh, no.
[37:55.300 --> 37:57.140]  Without any. Yeah, I understand.
[37:57.340 --> 38:01.100]  If you would have replied in any way, I would have immediately explained out of panic,
[38:01.100 --> 38:04.940]  anxiety of I don't think, you know, what if he doesn't know what this is?
[38:05.820 --> 38:07.240]  It definitely didn't.
[38:07.240 --> 38:10.220]  I woke up this morning thinking about my jingle, jingle, jingle text.
[38:10.380 --> 38:13.560]  You know, like I need to clarify this at some point.
[38:13.980 --> 38:15.060]  It's now that time.
[38:15.360 --> 38:16.440]  No, that's later.
[38:16.640 --> 38:17.320]  That's the future.
[38:17.400 --> 38:17.980]  That's the future.
[38:18.100 --> 38:20.620]  Well, we love mysteries this season.
[38:20.740 --> 38:22.560]  We'll let jingle, jingle, jingle be a mystery.
[38:22.680 --> 38:24.600]  OK, well, how far away?
[38:24.720 --> 38:25.720]  How far away is this?
[38:25.740 --> 38:27.280]  Is the solve to this mystery?
[38:27.340 --> 38:28.740]  Let's say two episodes from now.
[38:28.800 --> 38:29.980]  We'll talk. Oh, my God.
[38:29.980 --> 38:32.660]  All right. Well, Gavin, we have ourselves a mystery.
[38:32.960 --> 38:38.320]  OK, let's put on our sleuthing hats and and get our magnifying glasses.
[38:38.520 --> 38:39.940]  Gavin should be able to solve this.
[38:40.200 --> 38:41.400]  And let's solve.
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.700]  Let's figure out what could Andrew possibly be talking about?
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.040]  Hmm. Hmm.
[38:48.400 --> 38:49.500]  What was the context around?
[38:49.820 --> 38:53.660]  What was the last conversation you had with him before before the jingle, jingle, jingle?
[38:54.180 --> 38:57.060]  It could be a story about three Santas
[38:57.060 --> 39:00.480]  as they go around hacking various fast food restaurants.
[39:00.800 --> 39:01.700]  I mean, it could be.
[39:02.060 --> 39:03.320]  I guess it could be.
[39:03.980 --> 39:06.700]  Is there any I what have you guys been doing together?
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.320]  Playing a lot of Halo, right? Is it is?
[39:08.520 --> 39:09.500]  Could there be Halo?
[39:09.980 --> 39:12.240]  Any sort of a Halo connection there?
[39:13.520 --> 39:14.440]  Jingle, jingle.
[39:15.140 --> 39:17.860]  Hmm. Did you did you lose your keys recently?
[39:20.100 --> 39:21.620]  No. Hmm. No.
[39:22.080 --> 39:25.380]  Had a door handle that almost exploded, but I don't think Andrew knows about it.
[39:25.380 --> 39:27.260]  Wait, what? What?
[39:28.660 --> 39:30.320]  Yeah, the door handle go bad.
[39:30.660 --> 39:32.840]  Yeah. Let's stop. Let's take a break from the mystery.
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.340]  And what? Well, first of all, what did the breadclips say on it?
[39:36.500 --> 39:37.300]  When did it expire?
[39:39.640 --> 39:40.720]  That joke landed.
[39:41.260 --> 39:42.580]  That was a great joke.
[39:42.700 --> 39:44.060]  Let's talk about how well that went.
[39:44.120 --> 39:46.280]  That was a fucking holy shit to that bomb.
[39:47.980 --> 39:48.840]  Everybody's dead.
[39:49.340 --> 39:51.920]  That's just fucking horrendous.
[39:52.180 --> 39:53.940]  Don't edit out that silence, Nick.
[39:54.480 --> 39:55.780]  Just leave that in.
[39:56.020 --> 39:57.040]  Oh, my God.
[39:59.760 --> 40:00.120]  Devastating.
[40:00.200 --> 40:01.700]  I was excited about that one, too.
[40:01.840 --> 40:02.680]  I thought that was good.
[40:02.820 --> 40:04.220]  Why were you excited about that?
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.340]  I was. I was like, hey, we're turning it into the bread clip.
[40:07.440 --> 40:10.140]  I thought, let's get a full mental process on that.
[40:10.200 --> 40:12.200]  I mean, I thought you I like the throwback.
[40:12.700 --> 40:14.200]  Yeah, I thought it was a good throwback.
[40:14.800 --> 40:16.220]  Breadclips have been talked about recently.
[40:16.520 --> 40:17.720]  I thought it was a good throwback.
[40:17.920 --> 40:19.220]  I was excited about it.
[40:19.280 --> 40:20.260]  And it was a nothing.
[40:20.720 --> 40:22.660]  Let's well, let's you know, let's not assume it's nothing.
[40:22.660 --> 40:26.060]  Gavin, did a bread clip have anything to do with your door handle exploding?
[40:26.400 --> 40:28.340]  No. And I don't know.
[40:29.140 --> 40:30.280]  Not as far as I'm aware.
[40:30.740 --> 40:32.160]  Hmm. Well, that's too bad.
[40:32.820 --> 40:35.220]  I will say I'm trying to help you out there, Andrew.
[40:35.580 --> 40:36.540]  Excellent recovery.
[40:36.780 --> 40:40.560]  Because your reaction to your joke was, I thought, hilarious.
[40:40.900 --> 40:41.600]  Oh, for sure.
[40:42.040 --> 40:43.300]  Oh, it was. Well, there's nothing.
[40:43.420 --> 40:47.180]  It was just I thought you could have told me that I dropped from the call.
[40:47.340 --> 40:48.140]  It was so silent.
[40:49.460 --> 40:52.340]  It was as if I had downloaded the law again.
[40:52.340 --> 40:54.720]  The level of just not being able to.
[40:55.500 --> 40:57.300]  But I hadn't decided to live with it.
[40:57.360 --> 40:59.640]  But I want to know about your door knob exploding.
[41:00.380 --> 41:02.400]  Anything to put him further away from that joke?
[41:02.560 --> 41:05.000]  Let's just keep driving away from the bomb site.
[41:05.240 --> 41:06.020]  Just keep going.
[41:07.940 --> 41:10.000]  I'm a I'm a big handle guy.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.300]  Not a knob guy when it comes to doors.
[41:13.580 --> 41:18.700]  And I have a major issue with my cat getting into the bedroom at night.
[41:18.940 --> 41:20.800]  You know, we can attempt to lock the door from the inside,
[41:20.800 --> 41:23.920]  but he just twats the handle over and over and over again.
[41:24.080 --> 41:26.260]  And eventually he gets in because he can open the doors.
[41:26.460 --> 41:31.120]  So I thought we need a handle that only humans can use.
[41:31.260 --> 41:35.300]  So I got a fingerprint scanning handle.
[41:37.420 --> 41:38.580]  Eric says that's a knob.
[41:38.740 --> 41:39.680]  I don't want the knob, Eric.
[41:39.800 --> 41:41.180]  I don't like the fears of a knob.
[41:41.260 --> 41:41.740]  It is a knob.
[41:41.820 --> 41:43.080]  Yeah. What do you mean?
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.640]  How much of your life do you spend with a knob in your hand, man?
[41:46.740 --> 41:48.340]  It's like less than two seconds.
[41:48.340 --> 41:52.980]  To me, there's so much satisfaction lost in a doorknob
[41:52.980 --> 41:56.080]  that you you just lose all of the satisfaction from the handle.
[41:57.840 --> 41:59.780]  Wow. Am I alone on this?
[41:59.920 --> 42:01.200]  Yeah, but it's the knob feel.
[42:02.020 --> 42:02.700]  Not a fan of it.
[42:03.040 --> 42:06.660]  The action with turning a knob and the action of turning a handle are the same.
[42:06.760 --> 42:08.560]  It's just your hand is in a slightly different position.
[42:08.960 --> 42:11.820]  It's just a more positive feel.
[42:12.080 --> 42:12.520]  Feedback.
[42:12.700 --> 42:15.100]  There's like a nice haptic feedback from a handle
[42:15.740 --> 42:18.420]  that I think a knob is lost on.
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.880]  A knob, you don't always know when you're at the end of the knob reach,
[42:23.060 --> 42:25.800]  and then eventually your hand has to slide where the knob stops.
[42:26.180 --> 42:27.480]  And I don't like that feeling.
[42:27.940 --> 42:32.440]  A handle ends, you know, a handle pull has a hard stop on it,
[42:32.740 --> 42:34.280]  but your hand doesn't keep going.
[42:35.280 --> 42:37.420]  Anyway, I got a cheap piece of shit,
[42:37.620 --> 42:41.020]  $35 fingerprint reading doorknob.
[42:41.520 --> 42:42.960]  And that was my first mistake.
[42:42.960 --> 42:46.320]  I probably should have gone for one that was more expensive.
[42:46.600 --> 42:50.040]  And I don't want to use the fingerprint part of it.
[42:50.360 --> 42:52.380]  I just want it to, you know, read any fingerprint,
[42:52.640 --> 42:56.460]  because I don't think Smee knows about the fingerprint part.
[42:56.600 --> 43:01.360]  I don't think he knows to sort of touch his little beans against the fingerprint reader.
[43:01.540 --> 43:06.580]  So he just hits the handle and it doesn't go because he hasn't touched the capacitive part.
[43:07.280 --> 43:11.000]  And it took four AAA batteries.
[43:11.560 --> 43:15.520]  And I think when I was installing it,
[43:15.540 --> 43:19.280]  I may have sort of kinked a wire or done something when I was putting the cover back on
[43:19.280 --> 43:21.280]  to the point where I was testing out the handle.
[43:21.380 --> 43:23.380]  I was like, oh, this seems to work pretty well.
[43:23.480 --> 43:26.140]  Smee can't open it. I can open it. Anyone can open it. That's great.
[43:26.620 --> 43:28.100]  But then I started to smell something.
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.020]  And then I realized on the inside of the room,
[43:31.560 --> 43:34.760]  the handle was insanely hot to the point where it was like
[43:34.760 --> 43:36.780]  I couldn't even touch it for more than three seconds.
[43:36.800 --> 43:38.220]  I was like, oh, it's burning me.
[43:38.220 --> 43:41.940]  And then I saw the cover start to bulge.
[43:42.160 --> 43:45.640]  And I was getting really worried because I'd already put away my screwdriver and stuff.
[43:45.680 --> 43:46.840]  But I was freaking out.
[43:47.180 --> 43:52.440]  Ended up running to my garage to get my tools because I thought the door handle was going to explode.
[43:52.720 --> 43:55.080]  I made it. I mean, I made it back in time. I got the thing off.
[43:55.120 --> 43:57.780]  It was like burning me. It was like shit was melting inside.
[43:57.840 --> 43:58.680]  It was starting to stink.
[43:59.040 --> 44:02.720]  I just flung the batteries out because they'd all started to sort of angle outwards.
[44:02.780 --> 44:06.880]  I think there was some sort of piece of the board that was like a capacitor
[44:06.880 --> 44:08.820]  or something that was about to pop or something like that.
[44:09.220 --> 44:12.900]  But it was just really a continuation of my bedroom problems
[44:12.900 --> 44:16.600]  that I don't think most people have, you know, like the exploding Apple remote,
[44:16.760 --> 44:19.680]  the ripped sheets, the exploding door handle.
[44:19.880 --> 44:25.680]  But a little part of me thought I should have just waited to see if the door handle exploded.
[44:25.880 --> 44:29.360]  But I just didn't want to burn the room down because I'm sort of still in that phase of
[44:29.360 --> 44:32.640]  I want to be careful in this room because shit keeps going wrong in it.
[44:32.640 --> 44:37.500]  OK, did you did you check the reviews to see if anybody mentioned spontaneous combustion?
[44:38.060 --> 44:40.540]  I'll be honest, it was a pretty poorly reviewed door handle.
[44:41.680 --> 44:45.120]  You can't. We cannot like get.
[44:45.400 --> 44:48.040]  You cannot get away with the statement you just made.
[44:48.580 --> 44:50.540]  You're like, I've been having bad luck in that room.
[44:50.860 --> 44:52.120]  Doorknob almost exploded.
[44:52.220 --> 44:54.580]  The exploding Apple remote, you broke the Apple remote.
[44:54.680 --> 44:55.580]  You snapped that in half.
[44:55.620 --> 44:57.360]  You decide you made that decision.
[44:57.580 --> 44:58.780]  They're not the same thing.
[44:59.180 --> 45:00.700]  Andrew, it's all my fault.
[45:01.040 --> 45:02.380]  I can't be blaming any of these things.
[45:02.380 --> 45:03.960]  I decided to do all of these things.
[45:04.040 --> 45:05.980]  Well, maybe. I mean, the sheet was an accident.
[45:06.120 --> 45:08.380]  I wasn't trying to break that, but it was all me doing it.
[45:08.740 --> 45:12.940]  Didn't you break your bed in a different way that you didn't think you didn't mention on the show?
[45:13.140 --> 45:14.660]  Is that a thing that I make that up?
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.440]  Uh, are you are you thinking of you, Andrew?
[45:18.900 --> 45:20.040]  No, I'm not thinking of me.
[45:20.500 --> 45:21.380]  My bed is fine.
[45:21.780 --> 45:26.280]  I have a bed frame on my patio still, but outside of that, everything's good.
[45:26.880 --> 45:28.200]  What? How did my bed break?
[45:28.400 --> 45:28.980]  You might be right.
[45:29.040 --> 45:29.700]  I don't know.
[45:29.700 --> 45:34.580]  I think you said that you it broke a second time or something else happened to it.
[45:34.580 --> 45:35.660]  But I guess I'm wrong.
[45:35.820 --> 45:37.520]  I guess I made that up for some reason.
[45:37.540 --> 45:38.960]  That's something that you don't remember.
[45:39.240 --> 45:39.780]  I don't remember.
[45:40.060 --> 45:40.660]  Jingle, jingle, jingle.
[45:40.720 --> 45:43.480]  I swear to God, if we're playing Halo later and you're like, hey,
[45:44.060 --> 45:46.300]  oh, I just remember the bed thing. I'm going to kill you.
[45:46.980 --> 45:47.840]  We will not.
[45:48.860 --> 45:50.600]  Definitively, we will not all be here in eight years.
[45:50.680 --> 45:51.300]  You will be dead.
[45:51.580 --> 45:53.000]  I just need to stop messing with stuff.
[45:53.500 --> 45:56.640]  I'm going to text you at like 11 o'clock tonight and go, oh, I just got the bread clip joke.
[45:56.700 --> 45:57.100]  Real funny.
[45:59.120 --> 46:00.180]  What's that? What's up, Eric?
[46:00.740 --> 46:02.040]  Oh, yeah. Do you have a knob now?
[46:02.220 --> 46:05.660]  Honestly, I still think the exploding handle is better than the knob.
[46:05.920 --> 46:07.540]  You're insane. Shut up. Why?
[46:07.760 --> 46:09.700]  Are you serious? Shut up.
[46:09.740 --> 46:11.400]  What are you talking about?
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.200]  You're out of your mind.
[46:13.360 --> 46:15.120]  You're going to burn your house down.
[46:15.740 --> 46:19.320]  Uh, I mean, your triple A batteries are going to burn your fucking house down
[46:19.320 --> 46:20.100]  because you have a cat.
[46:20.200 --> 46:22.980]  He's he's certainly not using the battery part now, right?
[46:22.980 --> 46:25.920]  Like, it's just you have a knob that doesn't have a thing.
[46:25.920 --> 46:26.700]  You just have a knob.
[46:26.920 --> 46:30.540]  I rearranged. I rearranged the wire and I packed in.
[46:30.860 --> 46:33.020]  Oh, you're fucking you're a fucking lunatic.
[46:33.280 --> 46:35.260]  I think it was an error with one of the batteries.
[46:36.560 --> 46:38.440]  You are an insane person.
[46:38.680 --> 46:41.620]  I packed in four new ones, monitored it.
[46:41.920 --> 46:46.640]  And I have, you know, fingers crossed, a relatively cool fingerprint
[46:46.640 --> 46:49.340]  doorknob handle shit that works.
[46:49.460 --> 46:51.540]  And I think I think I'm going to keep it for now
[46:51.540 --> 46:53.100]  because I still think that's better than a knob.
[46:54.520 --> 46:57.160]  Between Geoff's bikes and your doorknob,
[46:57.260 --> 46:59.240]  batteries are just a no go for this show.
[46:59.540 --> 47:00.820]  Yeah, I can't enjoy batteries.
[47:01.080 --> 47:02.200]  They will always be dangerous.
[47:02.440 --> 47:03.040]  They are dangerous.
[47:03.640 --> 47:06.900]  I do. I don't know if we talked about it, but I really appreciate it, Geoff,
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.240]  that your your bike essentially kept exploding every time you ride it
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.460]  and that you had multiple times of like after the first time it exploded.
[47:15.580 --> 47:17.480]  You didn't give up. You're like, we'll give it another go.
[47:17.520 --> 47:18.380]  I made another fix.
[47:18.460 --> 47:20.460]  Hopefully it won't explode this time.
[47:20.560 --> 47:21.440]  Process of elimination.
[47:21.440 --> 47:24.080]  You got to try all the different permutations until you think
[47:24.080 --> 47:26.200]  until you narrow it down to what the real problem is.
[47:26.480 --> 47:30.160]  So is every single person in disagreement about the knobs before we move on?
[47:30.420 --> 47:31.580]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
[47:31.620 --> 47:33.860]  You're you're you're in the wrong here, 100 percent.
[47:34.080 --> 47:35.500]  OK, so what if you have?
[47:35.940 --> 47:37.980]  No, you've got stuff, you've got something in both hands.
[47:38.280 --> 47:41.080]  What? You need to use an elbow to open the door.
[47:41.400 --> 47:42.860]  You're you're shit out of luck with a knob.
[47:43.260 --> 47:46.460]  Yeah, but not only are you wrong about this, you are so wrong
[47:46.460 --> 47:49.500]  that it makes my McDonald's take look even more right,
[47:49.500 --> 47:51.740]  because I disagree with that being a hack.
[47:51.880 --> 47:53.040]  Nick said he likes handles.
[47:53.160 --> 47:55.840]  Handles are great, but I don't I'm not Pat.
[47:55.920 --> 47:57.360]  Like, I don't I've never considered.
[47:57.680 --> 47:58.560]  Nobody hates handles.
[47:59.700 --> 48:01.740]  This isn't an anti handle thing.
[48:01.940 --> 48:03.580]  Yeah, nobody's anti handle here, man.
[48:03.980 --> 48:05.720]  I think it's a pretty pro handle podcast.
[48:06.300 --> 48:08.660]  We're also just pro doorknob and pro common sense.
[48:09.300 --> 48:11.180]  Hmm. Well, I mean, what would your solution be?
[48:11.360 --> 48:12.120]  Just go with the knob.
[48:12.480 --> 48:13.060]  Deal with it. Yeah.
[48:13.560 --> 48:14.340]  Go with the knob.
[48:14.660 --> 48:17.560]  Is it weird if all of my doors have handles and one's got a knob?
[48:17.560 --> 48:18.340]  Is that weird?
[48:18.840 --> 48:20.120]  Yes. Yes, that is weird.
[48:20.360 --> 48:22.820]  Yeah. I don't want to redo the whole house.
[48:23.220 --> 48:26.600]  Right. But also your house burning down because of one knob
[48:26.600 --> 48:28.500]  is also weird if you think about it.
[48:28.880 --> 48:30.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:32.340 --> 48:35.780]  We really should have saw it coming after it really exploded the first time.
[48:37.200 --> 48:38.360]  So wait a minute.
[48:38.500 --> 48:41.420]  So you installed this handle recently.
[48:41.700 --> 48:42.680]  Before that, it was a knob?
[48:43.540 --> 48:44.680]  No, before that was a handle.
[48:44.900 --> 48:46.740]  So your whole house has been handles this whole time.
[48:46.740 --> 48:48.400]  When you moved in, was it all handles?
[48:48.640 --> 48:51.400]  Or did you move in and go, oh, look at these fucking knobs.
[48:51.500 --> 48:53.520]  I'm not about it. Let's get this fixed.
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.400]  Uh, yeah, it was handles to begin with.
[48:56.800 --> 48:57.800]  Handles to begin with.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.260]  Got a handle house. That's interesting.
[48:59.620 --> 49:00.800]  Apart from a few pocket doors.
[49:01.260 --> 49:02.140]  Yeah. Huh.
[49:02.740 --> 49:04.600]  I wonder if because you have a newer home.
[49:04.720 --> 49:06.800]  I wonder if knobs are on the way out.
[49:06.880 --> 49:09.640]  I wonder if handles are like the new the new hotness.
[49:09.940 --> 49:11.000]  That's an interesting question.
[49:11.060 --> 49:12.740]  No, I think it's because my house is very old.
[49:12.900 --> 49:15.720]  My house is very, very old, but it's all it's all knobs.
[49:15.720 --> 49:16.360]  It's knob city.
[49:16.720 --> 49:17.560]  What about you, Andrew?
[49:18.280 --> 49:22.440]  I don't I don't know if I've ever lived in a house that was knob centric.
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.380]  I'd say majority handle.
[49:24.980 --> 49:28.240]  Eric says no handles are for office buildings.
[49:28.860 --> 49:29.560]  Knobs are for homes.
[49:29.960 --> 49:33.460]  I've always thought handles were default and knobs are for like apartments.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.060]  Oh, hmm.
[49:35.680 --> 49:36.340]  I'm not sure.
[49:36.700 --> 49:37.220]  I'm trying to think.
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.660]  I feel like knobs are better suited for like other people entering a room.
[49:41.800 --> 49:43.300]  And that's more like keys and knobs.
[49:43.780 --> 49:46.960]  Wasn't the whole basis for when we were selling bat knobs.
[49:47.820 --> 49:49.580]  Didn't you want that to be a knob?
[49:49.700 --> 49:52.080]  Is that the only time you've ever fought for a knob?
[49:52.200 --> 49:53.840]  You've advocated for the knob.
[49:54.360 --> 49:57.940]  Well, a bat, a bat with a door handle at the end would be a bit weird, don't you think?
[49:58.260 --> 50:01.040]  Well, no, I feel like you wanted it to be like a knob,
[50:01.120 --> 50:04.500]  like you wanted it to be a cabinet knob, essentially was what you described.
[50:04.980 --> 50:05.680]  That's the point you wanted.
[50:06.260 --> 50:08.260]  Cabinets, you don't have cabinet handles.
[50:08.260 --> 50:10.280]  Wait a second. We can't go back to this.
[50:10.380 --> 50:12.500]  We cannot. That's in a different season.
[50:12.500 --> 50:15.040]  We can't go back to the knob conversation, please.
[50:15.320 --> 50:16.160]  We can't.
[50:18.280 --> 50:19.220]  I don't know.
[50:20.420 --> 50:21.220]  Maybe we can.
[50:21.540 --> 50:25.260]  I think if you're going to do this, you got to you got to be a fucking man about it
[50:25.260 --> 50:27.260]  and you got to get rid of every knob in your house,
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.260]  which means you can't have a knob on any of your cabinetry in your bathroom,
[50:31.360 --> 50:31.920]  your kitchen, anywhere.
[50:32.080 --> 50:34.500]  You have to handle all of your kitchen counter cabinets,
[50:35.440 --> 50:36.920]  the fucking under your sink.
[50:36.960 --> 50:37.920]  That's all got to be handles.
[50:37.920 --> 50:43.120]  If doorknobs were like our bat knobs, a little bit more ergonomic for the hand.
[50:43.240 --> 50:44.380]  I think I'd be into it.
[50:44.560 --> 50:46.200]  I just don't like grabbing a sphere.
[50:46.660 --> 50:47.920]  It's not very satisfying to me.
[50:48.080 --> 50:49.960]  Now, I do like grabbing a sphere.
[50:50.320 --> 50:53.540]  I find spheres to be incredibly like a sphere is what you want to throw.
[50:53.760 --> 50:54.640]  You want to put your hand.
[50:54.740 --> 50:56.120]  It feels good to hold a baseball.
[50:56.600 --> 51:00.240]  A sphere is great when held from underneath, but you don't grab a doorknob
[51:00.240 --> 51:01.040]  from the bottom.
[51:02.600 --> 51:06.240]  I, I can't follow that line of thinking.
[51:06.240 --> 51:07.700]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[51:09.140 --> 51:12.420]  What if your doorknobs were baseballs?
[51:12.680 --> 51:13.640]  What about that?
[51:13.940 --> 51:15.180]  Would you be OK with a knob in this area?
[51:15.180 --> 51:17.320]  I'd be fine with that because the grip would be excellent.
[51:17.460 --> 51:20.160]  It's the slip at the end of the doorbell of...
[51:20.160 --> 51:21.200]  Oh, God, the door.
[51:22.080 --> 51:24.080]  I really do wish I'd never started talking.
[51:24.500 --> 51:25.660]  Yeah, isn't it terrible?
[51:27.320 --> 51:28.540]  At least we're listening to you.
[51:28.860 --> 51:30.000]  Speaking is always a mistake.
[51:33.300 --> 51:35.060]  Um, I realize...
[51:35.600 --> 51:38.000]  I don't even know how to phrase this, talking.
[51:38.400 --> 51:39.460]  I'm having a bad talk day.
[51:39.760 --> 51:40.560]  I got so excited.
[51:40.640 --> 51:44.720]  I woke up and I saw that the company that made Garfield Kart 2,
[51:45.260 --> 51:48.940]  Curious Racing, announced that three more Garfield games
[51:48.940 --> 51:51.000]  will be coming out over the next few years.
[51:51.260 --> 51:52.400]  This is the Italian company?
[51:52.860 --> 51:54.240]  This is, I think they're French.
[51:54.680 --> 51:56.580]  Their Microids is their name.
[51:56.980 --> 52:01.080]  And I was so excited that I was like, I need to, I need to retweet this.
[52:01.160 --> 52:02.880]  I need to quote tweet this.
[52:02.880 --> 52:07.180]  And so I first, I just retweeted it by mistake without putting anything there.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.220]  Then I'll post it.
[52:10.580 --> 52:12.360]  I'll post the Discord so you can read it, Gavin.
[52:12.600 --> 52:13.920]  Then you can see what I did.
[52:13.940 --> 52:14.940]  I followed it up with.
[52:15.020 --> 52:16.520]  I made I made a quick adjustment.
[52:16.740 --> 52:18.380]  I'm like, no, can't can't read that.
[52:18.740 --> 52:21.600]  You can read, read what I wrote.
[52:27.560 --> 52:27.960]  Beings.
[52:28.660 --> 52:32.420]  My Dynasty Beings was my second attempt.
[52:33.160 --> 52:35.160]  And I felt like you replied to it.
[52:35.260 --> 52:37.820]  You left it and replied, Beings, I suck.
[52:39.640 --> 52:43.240]  Because I felt like you can't retry three times.
[52:43.460 --> 52:45.240]  So I'm now stuck with Beings.
[52:45.380 --> 52:48.580]  But I have to, much like my great bread clip joke.
[52:48.620 --> 52:49.600]  That was today as well.
[52:49.920 --> 52:51.060]  We're having a bad words day.
[52:51.280 --> 52:53.260]  Oh, that looks great.
[52:53.960 --> 52:57.620]  Geoff just posted a photo of a door that has two baseballs as the knob.
[52:57.680 --> 52:58.460]  That looks awesome.
[52:58.940 --> 52:59.800]  That's got to be.
[52:59.800 --> 53:02.960]  We've got to all three of us do our offices like that.
[53:04.480 --> 53:06.480]  Yes, I support this.
[53:06.740 --> 53:10.340]  Oh, looks like those are Atlanta Braves baseballs.
[53:10.500 --> 53:13.460]  We need. Well, OK, is it what version of Zimmer?
[53:13.840 --> 53:15.500]  It's Cubs, right? For what?
[53:15.680 --> 53:19.020]  For the like, if we're getting baseballs, I feel like they obviously.
[53:19.300 --> 53:21.080]  The boys of Zimmer was Cubs era. Yeah.
[53:21.400 --> 53:23.420]  So we got to get Zimmer signed balls.
[53:23.740 --> 53:26.940]  No, I'm saying we have to get Cubs balls if they're Braves.
[53:26.980 --> 53:29.060]  Like if we're clearly in line with Zimmer.
[53:29.060 --> 53:31.840]  Well, we may we're making face baseballs.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.420]  So because I got to hit them all. We are.
[53:33.820 --> 53:35.980]  That's true. I can't wait for that.
[53:36.180 --> 53:38.900]  It's going to I have a I have a Ken Griffey Jr.
[53:39.040 --> 53:40.280]  ball I could use for my handle.
[53:41.580 --> 53:42.620]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[53:42.840 --> 53:43.940]  Why do you have that?
[53:44.460 --> 53:46.180]  I just did a video with him and he signed it.
[53:46.440 --> 53:47.980]  Oh, that's nice. He's a nice guy.
[53:48.220 --> 53:50.140]  Is he? Have you met Ken Griffey Jr.?
[53:50.140 --> 53:53.420]  I have never met him, but they say, oh, he's just lovely.
[53:53.780 --> 53:54.940]  They say that's so exciting.
[53:55.280 --> 53:58.380]  Everything I've read is that he's just like he's just a delightful person.
[53:58.380 --> 53:59.700]  But I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.
[54:00.120 --> 54:02.460]  Gavin, what was your experience working with Ken Griffey Jr.?
[54:02.460 --> 54:05.940]  The man who, by the way, to this day, I think probably had
[54:05.940 --> 54:08.700]  the most natural swing in the history of baseball.
[54:09.200 --> 54:10.340]  Just a beautiful swing.
[54:10.920 --> 54:11.800]  I'm sure Gavin would agree.
[54:12.060 --> 54:12.880]  Sweetest swing in baseball.
[54:13.140 --> 54:13.720]  Sweetest swing?
[54:16.700 --> 54:18.080]  I'm just going to call it the sweetest swing.
[54:18.580 --> 54:18.720]  Ken Griffey.
[54:21.120 --> 54:23.220]  Where would the nickname go for a Ken Griffey Jr.?
[54:23.220 --> 54:26.560]  I feel like it's tough to have the like the nickname in the middle
[54:26.560 --> 54:29.500]  when you have three names or when you have a junior on it.
[54:29.800 --> 54:31.340]  Do you know what his nickname was, Gavin?
[54:31.580 --> 54:32.820]  No, I don't. No.
[54:32.860 --> 54:33.320]  What was his name?
[54:33.780 --> 54:34.420]  Well, he had two.
[54:35.300 --> 54:37.860]  I remember him being referred to as the kid a lot,
[54:37.900 --> 54:41.120]  but they also called him junior because his dad, Ken Griffey Sr.,
[54:41.120 --> 54:41.940]  also played baseball.
[54:42.780 --> 54:44.960]  So his nickname was the kid or junior.
[54:45.120 --> 54:48.040]  And until injuries, he was probably going to go down
[54:48.040 --> 54:49.260]  as one of the greatest players of all time.
[54:49.340 --> 54:50.380]  I mean, I guess maybe he still has.
[54:50.940 --> 54:54.120]  But yeah, I mean, having never really seen a baseball game,
[54:54.560 --> 54:57.940]  I didn't know of his career, but I knew the name.
[54:58.500 --> 54:59.280]  Did you ask him about the staple?
[54:59.640 --> 55:00.760]  Didn't ask him about the staple.
[55:01.160 --> 55:04.300]  Honestly, I didn't really want to ask him about anything that he'd done
[55:04.300 --> 55:06.140]  because I just didn't want to embarrass myself in front of him.
[55:06.320 --> 55:06.960]  Yeah, sure.
[55:07.500 --> 55:10.040]  I feel like if I was Andrew, I'd have sent him an email
[55:10.040 --> 55:13.760]  before he showed up saying, I don't like your games of baseball.
[55:14.200 --> 55:16.440]  No, just just so we're on the record.
[55:16.520 --> 55:18.540]  I don't like the Seattle Mariners, and I never have.
[55:18.640 --> 55:19.660]  Anyway, it's nice to meet you.
[55:21.140 --> 55:22.020]  But yeah, it was nice.
[55:22.020 --> 55:24.060]  He was injured, actually, when we...
[55:24.060 --> 55:26.060]  I felt like he was in pain while we were filming with him.
[55:26.260 --> 55:26.960]  He'd hurt his foot.
[55:27.380 --> 55:29.060]  That would describe most of his career, unfortunately.
[55:30.040 --> 55:33.640]  He was a trooper and he he slammed some balls.
[55:33.940 --> 55:38.160]  And the balls that he missed or he didn't go for, Dan caught
[55:38.160 --> 55:39.420]  and one of them broke his finger.
[55:39.880 --> 55:42.460]  So Dan partially holds Ken Griffey Jr.
[55:42.600 --> 55:44.240]  responsible for his broken finger.
[55:44.480 --> 55:47.540]  So Tony Hawk broke his wrist and Ken Griffey Jr. broke his finger.
[55:48.420 --> 55:49.940]  Yeah, indirectly I'd say yes.
[55:50.460 --> 55:54.800]  Oh, man, uh, we're getting the the rap sign from Eric.
[55:55.440 --> 55:58.200]  I do feel like, though, we should mention at this point
[55:58.820 --> 56:02.080]  that I believe the Tiki toilets are out.
[56:02.240 --> 56:02.700]  They're out.
[56:03.120 --> 56:04.080]  Oh, yeah.
[56:04.200 --> 56:06.500]  Yesterday, we should mention, I think, depending.
[56:06.720 --> 56:10.120]  I think this I think this is tomorrow for when you hear this.
[56:10.620 --> 56:11.780]  It's very exciting.
[56:12.160 --> 56:13.840]  I can't speak today.
[56:13.900 --> 56:14.880]  I'm rattled.
[56:15.220 --> 56:16.220]  I've been. What are you?
[56:16.540 --> 56:19.660]  Yesterday they came out that they came out on the first
[56:19.660 --> 56:20.640]  of February.
[56:21.160 --> 56:22.700]  That is not that day for us.
[56:22.800 --> 56:25.540]  I've noticed that there's there's six people on this discord.
[56:25.740 --> 56:28.460]  We have we have Nick, Eric and Kat.
[56:28.560 --> 56:32.060]  What if the three of us just sub out and they can do the next one?
[56:32.380 --> 56:35.180]  I don't think that's part of Kat's internship plan
[56:35.180 --> 56:37.820]  to take over an established podcast.
[56:38.440 --> 56:41.960]  I don't think it could be that much worse than the three of us
[56:41.960 --> 56:42.840]  trying to talk again.
[56:43.880 --> 56:45.080]  The bar is low.
[56:45.540 --> 56:48.360]  I'm just glad that we don't hate each other by the end of this one.
[56:48.850 --> 56:49.900]  And I'm very excited.
[56:50.080 --> 56:56.300]  Let me let me properly not sell, but talk about the port-a-potty I bought.
[56:59.740 --> 57:01.640]  I think you're right.
[57:02.440 --> 57:04.140]  Oh, no, no, no.
[57:04.740 --> 57:08.000]  I bought one a year ago on February 1st.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.020]  It's a year they come out on the same on the anniversary of when I bought them.
[57:13.640 --> 57:18.020]  Oh, which is which is kind of cool.
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.600]  That it's coming out on the anniversary, but also just goes to show you
[57:22.600 --> 57:25.560]  how difficult supply chain issues are right now.
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.700]  We tried to buy that much like much like the fuck stick, which we bought
[57:30.700 --> 57:35.960]  and ordered in a fucking break show, which is, by the way, no longer on order.
[57:36.060 --> 57:37.040]  We're still working it out.
[57:37.340 --> 57:40.000]  We've had suffered some some fuck stick setbacks.
[57:40.840 --> 57:42.300]  It took a year.
[57:42.460 --> 57:45.920]  It took a year for us to get these these port-a-potty tiki.
[57:46.140 --> 57:47.420]  I just lost this shit.
[57:48.060 --> 57:52.040]  There were quality control issues with the first couple of suppliers
[57:52.040 --> 57:53.540]  and then the supply chain.
[57:53.700 --> 57:57.000]  And now a full year later, we have
[57:58.060 --> 58:00.800]  port-a-potty tiki mugs.
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.400]  And I would certainly appreciate it if you are in the market for a tiki mug.
[58:06.520 --> 58:08.680]  I would certainly appreciate it if you would buy them,
[58:08.780 --> 58:12.300]  because for some reason they bought a thousand of them.
[58:12.720 --> 58:14.380]  They are awesome. They're really cool.
[58:14.380 --> 58:19.940]  I lost it because Gavin had the least genuine O I've ever heard.
[58:21.400 --> 58:27.960]  When I bought them a year ago, you're like, oh, you didn't give a fuck at all.
[58:28.360 --> 58:32.940]  And then I wouldn't be accepting judgment on my O's.
[58:33.040 --> 58:34.340]  I think I was actually intrigued.
[58:35.080 --> 58:37.480]  There was zero intrigue in that O.
[58:37.720 --> 58:40.560]  And then while Geoff was talking, you're like, whoa,
[58:40.560 --> 58:44.980]  and equally, completely, that's why I lost it.
[58:45.340 --> 58:48.580]  Those two are the least genuine sounding statements I've ever heard.
[58:49.360 --> 58:52.780]  I've never heard anyone clearly not listening more.
[58:53.340 --> 58:55.580]  There are no fucks about what you're saying.
[58:56.160 --> 58:57.420]  What do you want from me?
[58:57.560 --> 58:58.480]  What do you want from me?
[58:58.760 --> 59:00.720]  I don't listen. What am I supposed to do?
[59:01.760 --> 59:04.000]  It doesn't sound even slightly interesting.
[59:04.840 --> 59:07.500]  It's not even like 10% interesting.
[59:10.620 --> 59:18.640]  I think what it is, is that in my head, you were playing it up like you'd maybe bought another port-a-potty.
[59:18.840 --> 59:24.040]  And when you said it was just a year since you bought the old one, I was like, oh, I don't think I was disappointed.
[59:24.180 --> 59:26.080]  I just was expecting something different.
[59:26.680 --> 59:29.040]  Now go back and listen to that.
[59:29.320 --> 59:33.160]  Can you give us about 10% enthusiasm, Gavis, and try to sell us on these Tiki
[59:34.180 --> 59:36.680]  Tiki mugs we bought, these port-a-potty, the Tiki toilets?
[59:36.680 --> 59:39.580]  I could try and give the O again, like do a second take.
[59:39.700 --> 59:41.600]  OK, give me a sec.
[59:41.720 --> 59:42.660]  All right, you want to set me up?
[59:43.080 --> 59:47.860]  So I bought these port-a-potties a year ago to the date when they're going up to be sold.
[59:48.820 --> 59:52.140]  And you're going to be able to buy your own port-a-potty, like I bought, but it's cheaper.
[59:52.340 --> 59:54.040]  And yours actually doesn't stop talking.
[59:54.120 --> 59:58.220]  So I can say, oh, you said the O while I was talking last time.
[59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.000]  Oh, what do you mean?
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.780]  Sorry, I forgot what I delivered it.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.700]  Why are you doing? Why make me do it again?
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.100]  It's just a never ending turn.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.780]  I was waiting for you to be done talking about interrupt.
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.340]  You always interrupt.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.980]  All right. One time.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.000]  Go again. Go again.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.080]  OK, I bought a port-a-potty a year ago.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.640]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.240]  Jesus.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.180]  That was pretty good.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.320]  Like and subscribe.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.660]  Buy a Tiki mug.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.900]  Also, nobody bought the Vancouver Child Kicker skateboards.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.040]  Clearly, you guys don't want to skate.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:33.860]  That's fine.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:39.340]  But if if you do find yourself in need of a skateboard deck,
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.160]  we were sitting on a mountain.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.520]  I I haven't been sent one.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.960]  Well, we got extras.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.180]  Well, I want I want the I want to go ahead.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.600]  No, it was our first guy who never interrupts.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.220]  Go ahead. Just fucking walk all over me.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.240]  What are you saying?
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.280]  I'll pause you.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.900]  Go ahead. No, no, no.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.120]  You got the floor, friend.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.000]  Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.860]  We need to do two of these.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.860]  That seems like a good place to end it.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:11.640]  Bye.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.880]  Hey, there, it's minor league fan Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.300]  episode of F*** Face.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.140]  It's a triple start.
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.900]  Geoff is royalty.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.840]  Andrew is either going to cheat or lose.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.840]  Gavin brings up friends again.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.260]  The boys discuss pizza consumption.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.920]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.660]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
