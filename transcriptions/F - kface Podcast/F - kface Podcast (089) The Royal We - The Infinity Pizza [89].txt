[00:46.190 --> 00:50.150]  Okay, we're back. Tiki Mugs have been out a week now. Thank you for buying them based
[00:50.150 --> 00:55.590]  off of that great read, that great promotion that we had. I'm sure they flew off the shelves.
[00:56.210 --> 01:03.390]  Let's go. Oh, we can start that way. Hello and welcome. What? What? We hadn't started?
[01:04.550 --> 01:08.890]  What do you mean we can start that way? We haven't started? I thought we started. Why
[01:08.890 --> 01:15.090]  would you think we'd started? Because we always... Have you even heard Gavin? Is he around? Yeah.
[01:15.670 --> 01:22.490]  Okay. Jesus Christ. I'm worried about speaking, to be honest. Is everybody recording? Yes.
[01:23.110 --> 01:32.390]  Okay. Hello and welcome to another episode of the FACE podcast. This is episode 89. My
[01:32.390 --> 01:38.010]  name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, the other two. Yes. Hello, other two. Hello.
[01:38.890 --> 01:46.410]  Andrew, you were saying in the pre-start, not the pleasantries, but the pre-start, that
[01:46.980 --> 01:55.010]  the pink Tiki Mugs or Tiki Toilets, as I affectionately refer to them. Yeah. Have been flying off
[01:55.010 --> 02:01.110]  the shelves thanks to Gavin's stellar promotion last episode in the last 30 seconds. I would
[02:01.110 --> 02:04.350]  hope so, because they're awesome. They are really good. I genuinely think they're great.
[02:04.350 --> 02:08.330]  I've been so excited for them. We've done merch meetings for months where it's been
[02:08.330 --> 02:11.790]  a thing that has been brought up of like, where are the mugs? Where are the Tiki Mugs?
[02:11.910 --> 02:16.430]  I'm so happy they're finally here. I can't wait to get one. So what happened to the originals?
[02:16.890 --> 02:22.630]  Okay, I can answer this. So originally we got... First off, it took a while for them
[02:22.630 --> 02:27.230]  to build a prototype, right? They had to design it in the 3D space. Then I think they did
[02:27.230 --> 02:32.890]  a 3D print to test it and come up with it just right. I think that was Tony and Tobin
[02:32.890 --> 02:38.110]  and those guys did all that. And then they sent it off to a manufacturer. The manufacturer
[02:38.110 --> 02:43.210]  sent back samples. I apologize if I'm getting this wrong, Ecom team. But I believe the
[02:43.210 --> 02:47.430]  samples came back and they were not of the quality that we felt comfortable with. And
[02:47.430 --> 02:50.570]  so we went through a couple rounds of that. We could never get it just right. So they
[02:50.570 --> 02:57.530]  went to a different distributor. And then supply chain issues became a reality. And
[02:57.530 --> 03:02.770]  so that's why it took an extra long amount of time. But now we got them. Well, we had
[03:02.770 --> 03:07.490]  them. They may already all be gone by now because we're recording in the future. We
[03:07.490 --> 03:12.830]  have to record 800 episodes in the future. Should we get into that? Well, before we get
[03:12.830 --> 03:18.090]  into that, the last thing on merch. You brought up the skateboard last episode. Oh, right.
[03:18.190 --> 03:24.310]  I kind of want one because I want to try to... I haven't attempted to ride a skateboard since
[03:24.310 --> 03:30.290]  the MVP accident. I retired on that day. I want to try to ride a skateboard again. I feel
[03:30.290 --> 03:34.430]  like this would be the perfect time to try it. The only thing, the only thing that's
[03:34.430 --> 03:39.610]  holding me back to fully committing this idea is that Tom Seger exists and he tried to
[03:39.610 --> 03:44.830]  dunk a basketball, which you wouldn't think would be disastrous. But didn't he like broke
[03:44.830 --> 03:49.250]  his whole body in half and had to have like serious surgery? He snapped his arm in half
[03:49.250 --> 03:53.450]  so it was bent backwards. But that wasn't even the worst part. He like he tore like
[03:53.450 --> 03:58.390]  a patella or something in his knee and like basically ended his leg and like had to do
[03:58.390 --> 04:03.210]  had to go through like multiple surgeries to repair it all. Yeah. But he was trying
[04:03.210 --> 04:07.430]  to jump. You're just trying to skate. Yeah, but I'm going to like there's no way I don't
[04:07.430 --> 04:12.050]  eat shit. And Gavin has already got me concerned about death. Why? Why? Because even door handles
[04:12.050 --> 04:16.550]  are dangerous in Gavin's world. Well, because door handles are dangerous aren't and I could
[04:16.550 --> 04:19.890]  be wrong. Maybe Geoff said it. I don't remember at this point. Weren't you the one that asked
[04:19.890 --> 04:23.630]  will we all be alive eight years from now? Oh, yeah. I just don't think that I just wonder.
[04:23.630 --> 04:28.250]  I wonder. Was that you that said it? Not Gavin? No, I didn't say that. I said I try
[04:28.250 --> 04:31.990]  and stay alive a little bit. That's not a very Gavin thing to say. No, it's not. But
[04:31.990 --> 04:36.050]  you both have death on my mind because you said that, Geoff, that that's, you know, death
[04:36.050 --> 04:41.150]  thing. Then a few weeks ago, several weeks, several episodes at this point, Gavin, you
[04:41.150 --> 04:47.470]  told a story about how in the snow you would walk by houses and if there weren't footprints,
[04:47.850 --> 04:51.790]  then you would be like, are they dead? You'd play the dead. You called it a game where
[04:51.790 --> 04:56.730]  you would try to decide if somebody had died or not. Guess they might be dead. Yep. Yeah.
[04:56.790 --> 05:02.910]  You said that there is a red car parked outside of my apartment that I could see and it had
[05:02.910 --> 05:07.950]  snow with snow and nobody went to it for like six days. And I had never thought about it
[05:07.950 --> 05:12.350]  before. But now every time I see that car, I wonder if that person's dead. Every time
[05:12.350 --> 05:16.910]  I look out my window, I'm confronted with the thought of death because of it is something
[05:16.910 --> 05:20.490]  I never thought about. But now it's all I can think about. So it's just I got death
[05:20.490 --> 05:24.790]  on the brain. I'd be terrified of getting on the board, but I might do it. I don't know.
[05:24.950 --> 05:29.130]  I'm on the fence. You're going to just be looking at that differently for forever now.
[05:29.270 --> 05:34.190]  Forever. Until that literally until unless somebody gets in that car and drives away,
[05:34.250 --> 05:37.850]  which I don't think it's been turned on and probably over a month at this point. That
[05:37.850 --> 05:40.630]  car is fucking dead. Well, maybe it's because the snow everywhere. They don't want to drive.
[05:40.830 --> 05:46.830]  No, it's sunny out now. I've never seen anyone touch that car ever. Maybe the car is abandoned.
[05:46.830 --> 05:53.610]  Our friend Gus one time had a had an old car that he kind of gave up on and he had
[05:53.610 --> 05:57.450]  it parked on the street in front of his house. And then he moved to a new house and he just
[05:57.450 --> 06:02.290]  left the car there. And for like three or four months, he eventually had it towed, I
[06:02.290 --> 06:05.130]  think. But for like three or four months, we would drive by and people would just put
[06:05.130 --> 06:09.590]  signs on it. They were like, please, for the love of God, remove this car. It's not funny
[06:09.590 --> 06:15.030]  anymore. What's going on? When I went by with him, someone had chucked like a dozen eggs
[06:15.030 --> 06:21.650]  on it. They would have felt pretty... they would have felt bad about themselves if he
[06:21.650 --> 06:26.270]  had just been dead in that house the whole time. I'm just egging the poor dead person's
[06:26.270 --> 06:32.150]  car. I can go out to check the car and it's going to have Ham fan as the license plate.
[06:33.230 --> 06:39.330]  Dude, I'll do you one better. What if somebody's dead in the car? I think I'd know. I think
[06:39.330 --> 06:44.830]  that would be discovered. Probably steam up on the inside. You think so? I think so.
[06:44.830 --> 06:48.070]  What were you going to say, Geoff? Before I took it to death, you're going to take us
[06:48.070 --> 06:51.670]  somewhere. I don't know. You're leading us. You're doing you're doing you're doing a really
[06:51.670 --> 06:57.150]  good job. Thanks. You were saying you want a skateboard. So yeah, before that, I brought
[06:57.150 --> 07:00.810]  us to skateboard talk, but you're going to take us somewhere else. I didn't want to step
[07:00.810 --> 07:06.050]  on because you don't even know, dude. As of two weeks ago, you have teased subjects that
[07:06.050 --> 07:11.810]  you had written and we still haven't covered them. Oh, God, they weren't. Yeah, one of them
[07:11.810 --> 07:20.710]  was. Well, OK, so you know how we had the idea for this might inspire a longer conversation
[07:20.710 --> 07:26.250]  than the other. Am I recording? OK. Yeah. Oh, my God. Why would you say that? I was
[07:26.250 --> 07:30.110]  just curious. I was pretty sure I was. OK. The one who was livid that we hadn't started
[07:30.110 --> 07:33.970]  the show yet is the one who didn't know when he was recording. I'll do this one first.
[07:34.030 --> 07:38.910]  So I was listening to Planet Money the other day and which is where we got the they're
[07:38.910 --> 07:44.950]  the people that that inspired the superhero conversation. So mine and their their their
[07:44.950 --> 07:50.170]  content for to steal more ideas and actually not. It was just like, you know, you play
[07:50.170 --> 07:54.870]  on on Alexa. You can say, like, play my daily briefing or whatever, and it'll just play.
[07:54.930 --> 07:58.010]  And then when it's over, it just keeps playing forever. It'll just keep throwing shit at
[07:58.010 --> 08:02.790]  you. Well, it threw some Planet Money at me after my briefing was over. And it was interesting.
[08:02.810 --> 08:07.810]  It was on the subject of sound IDs. And I don't know if you know what that is, Andrew. I had
[08:07.810 --> 08:10.390]  this conversation with Gavin actually in person because we went out to dinner the other
[08:10.390 --> 08:14.830]  night, which, by the way, I had a lovely time at dinner with Gavin and his wonderful
[08:14.830 --> 08:18.730]  girlfriend, Meg, and my girlfriend and and another friend. But man, are were you in
[08:18.730 --> 08:22.830]  a bad mood at dinner? I don't know what your deal was. It's not going to work every week.
[08:22.890 --> 08:28.350]  You said that. I'm not. I know. I'm serious. We left and Emily was like we were in the
[08:28.350 --> 08:32.390]  car and Emily was like, what was wrong with Gavin? And I was like, I don't know. What?
[08:32.390 --> 08:37.910]  What do you mean? I don't know. Ask her. Are you being serious? You came across as like
[08:37.910 --> 08:41.630]  really surly and annoyed. And I didn't know if it was because your friend was there or
[08:41.630 --> 08:45.710]  what, but it was bizarre. Is it because we sat down to the meal and you said, why are
[08:45.710 --> 08:52.750]  you in such a bad mood? Did I? You're making me self-conscious about the... when am I
[08:52.750 --> 08:59.270]  in a bad mood? Is Emily there? No, she's at work, man. I'll ask her tonight when she
[08:59.970 --> 09:05.490]  remembers why she said that. She seemed real concerned. I thought it was a nice time. Now
[09:05.490 --> 09:09.230]  I'm going to be second guessing every time we hang out. I'm trying to remember what
[09:09.230 --> 09:17.650]  happened. I like that this whole part started with Gavin saying, well, that's not going
[09:17.650 --> 09:23.090]  to work every week. And now we're here. I guess it works every week. He gets me every
[09:23.090 --> 09:28.430]  week with it. It really does. Oh, man, that's great. But if Emily said it, then it's real.
[09:28.790 --> 09:34.870]  Nah, she didn't. I made that part up, but thank you. Anyway, but thanks for showing
[09:34.870 --> 09:42.550]  me that your skin is still as thin as tissue paper. God, I appreciate that. Man, that felt
[09:42.550 --> 09:45.810]  great. That felt really... that made me feel good on the inside. You made me feel good
[09:45.810 --> 09:50.830]  about me. Briefly there. Appreciate that. Anyway, so I already had this idea with Gavin.
[09:51.370 --> 09:54.090]  He was in a great mood, by the way. Lovely. We had a wonderful dinner. Everybody had...
[09:54.090 --> 09:58.010]  We laughed. It was... everybody was just over the moon. Talked about how we should
[09:58.010 --> 10:02.010]  do it more often. We enjoy each other's company so much. It was a delightful evening from
[10:02.010 --> 10:07.330]  start to finish. Not a negative moment throughout the evening. Except it was windy outside.
[10:07.490 --> 10:11.090]  I think we all agree it was too windy. It was too windy. Could have rang the doorbell.
[10:11.130 --> 10:17.890]  It was way too windy. So anyway, on this Planet Money thing, it was all about sound IDs, which
[10:18.410 --> 10:22.870]  is not something I'd ever thought of before. But a sound ID is like when you turn on HBO
[10:22.870 --> 10:27.830]  in the old days, and it would go the snow, and then it would do the HBO sound, like the
[10:27.830 --> 10:32.770]  dun, dun, dun, or whatever. That's not anybody's sound ID. Because now that I'm thinking of
[10:32.770 --> 10:39.010]  it, all sound IDs have fled my brain. Or like when you load up Hulu, or when you get a text
[10:39.010 --> 10:42.910]  from... like in Facebook, you get an instant message or something. It makes an identifiable
[10:42.910 --> 10:48.430]  sound that you subconsciously start to recognize and associate with that product. And it was
[10:48.430 --> 10:54.350]  all about how... Actually, HBO, I guess, was spending a bunch of money and effort trying
[10:54.350 --> 10:59.490]  to recreate new sound IDs that made sense for the current times because they'd felt
[10:59.490 --> 11:00.470]  that theirs were dated.
[11:00.810 --> 11:04.330]  It wasn't just about HBO. It was about some other businesses too. And about the science
[11:04.330 --> 11:13.170]  that goes into it, and how difficult it is to perfectly design a short interstitial sound
[11:13.170 --> 11:19.210]  that then becomes synonymous with that brand in a positive way. And as I was going through
[11:19.210 --> 11:24.770]  all that, I was thinking like, man, F***face could really benefit from a sound ID. What
[11:24.770 --> 11:31.150]  would our sound ID, our like, you hear it and you instantly think of F***face, be? So
[11:31.150 --> 11:32.710]  I was just opening that up for conversation.
[11:32.830 --> 11:36.090]  Because we also have been discussing, and we may already have it at this point, but
[11:36.090 --> 11:39.850]  if we don't yet, audience, I would love your assistance. We want to build a soundboard
[11:39.850 --> 11:45.670]  of F***face sounds for the break show with like, you know, Andrew saying like, my name
[11:45.670 --> 11:49.090]  is Andrew Pan and I will eat the pencil, and like all the other different funny things
[11:49.090 --> 11:57.630]  that we say. Maybe like soda burping, and that time Andrew farted on Mike. Whatever
[11:57.630 --> 12:01.750]  your favorite little audio moments are. But I'd like to collect those for a soundboard.
[12:01.830 --> 12:05.830]  But also, like, what should our, I mean, I assume it would be the groan tube sound,
[12:05.830 --> 12:11.410]  but I just wanted to see what you guys thought. What should F***face's sound ID be?
[12:11.990 --> 12:18.210]  So can anything be, is any, so, hmm. Because I'm thinking like, what about the Wilhelm
[12:18.210 --> 12:22.950]  scream? Is that a sound ID? Does somebody own that? Does somebody make money every time
[12:22.950 --> 12:26.530]  Wilhelm dies? How does that work?
[12:26.910 --> 12:29.910]  I mean, I think it was made for a big audio library, wasn't it?
[12:30.530 --> 12:34.830]  Was it? Is that his name, Wilhelm? Where did the name Wilhelm come from?
[12:35.870 --> 12:39.510]  Also, has he died more than Sean Bean, who has more total movie-
[12:39.510 --> 12:42.950]  It has to be Wilhelm. Definitely died more than Sean Bean. I used to know the answer
[12:42.950 --> 12:44.550]  to that. I googled it once, but I don't remember now.
[12:44.930 --> 12:49.210]  I think it's an interesting idea. I like the sound ID. I never considered what the sound
[12:49.210 --> 12:52.910]  of F***face would be. I think it would be the sound of someone getting
[12:52.910 --> 12:54.690]  kicked and then like a kid crying.
[12:58.620 --> 13:04.420]  That never happened. It was close to happening, but it didn't happen.
[13:04.420 --> 13:08.360]  Man, talk about becoming an even less sponsorable podcast.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.200]  It's called F***face. It's got a kid crying at the beginning of every episode.
[13:18.040 --> 13:20.220]  Anyway, just something for y'all to think about.
[13:20.460 --> 13:22.720]  I'm excited to see the responses for that.
[13:23.160 --> 13:26.560]  Because this is such a fucking- this show is so dumb.
[13:27.060 --> 13:30.700]  The things that I forget that we did, like genuinely like two nights ago,
[13:30.700 --> 13:35.520]  I was late, I was going to bed, and I just randomly had this realization
[13:35.520 --> 13:41.940]  that we put garlic on our feet. And I forgot that we had done that.
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.280]  My foot was in a garlic bag. Gavin spread it like it was toast on his foot.
[13:47.580 --> 13:51.580]  We did a whole- we covered our foot in garlic and I forgot about it.
[13:51.700 --> 13:55.600]  That was not a thing that- I forgot about that too.
[13:55.900 --> 13:57.860]  Yeah! It's fucking crazy.
[13:57.860 --> 14:02.100]  Oh, that's low enough to not register as one of the weird things we did.
[14:03.440 --> 14:08.080]  That was my thought. So weird. How did I forget that?
[14:08.500 --> 14:09.920]  Oh, it was terrible. It was gross.
[14:10.480 --> 14:12.280]  That was disgusting.
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.880]  Do you know, Geoff, that food-wise, we've discovered Andrew's next British food
[14:16.880 --> 14:18.740]  that he's going to try on the podcast.
[14:19.040 --> 14:19.940]  No, what is it?
[14:20.300 --> 14:21.320]  We're going to go for Marmite.
[14:21.900 --> 14:22.500]  Oh, yeah.
[14:24.080 --> 14:25.540]  Marmite. Because it's quite an obvious one.
[14:25.540 --> 14:27.040]  I feel like-
[14:27.040 --> 14:28.300]  It's a bit of a low-hanging fruit.
[14:28.460 --> 14:30.500]  You've never had Marmite or Vegemite, right?
[14:30.920 --> 14:34.780]  I thought we were going with the whole box of items. Is that off the table?
[14:35.920 --> 14:37.080]  Are we doing the Brit-
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.420]  Nick's never had it either, but I have a feeling Nick would eat it and be like,
[14:41.480 --> 14:43.620]  Oh, I like it. This is good. And then he'd squirt the whole thing in his mouth.
[14:43.940 --> 14:50.300]  I want to pay Gavin to make me a subscription-style box of British items.
[14:50.760 --> 14:51.480]  A Brit box?
[14:52.200 --> 14:52.520]  Exactly.
[14:52.520 --> 14:57.180]  This came up because I said I was watching something on Britbox, which is like a streaming service.
[14:57.420 --> 15:06.060]  And I was like, that sounds like a subscription food thing where an American company would try to trick people into that these are classic British items.
[15:06.480 --> 15:11.260]  A nice subscription to your salad creams and your branch of pickle, your Marmite.
[15:11.720 --> 15:15.460]  I'd love a Brit box. I'm excited to try- I forgot that that was my next item.
[15:15.680 --> 15:16.980]  So you want me to do your whole box?
[15:17.560 --> 15:22.000]  I would- I think it would be funny to do a whole box, but you don't have to.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.960]  You could start small, Marmite.
[15:24.460 --> 15:26.820]  Is there a box worth of stuff I'm missing? There has to be.
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.540]  Yeah. I could get you a box together.
[15:29.740 --> 15:33.000]  Okay. Well, maybe we do the Brit box in the future.
[15:38.230 --> 15:41.010]  Valentine's Day is coming. Do you know how clean your butthole is?

[16:43.970 --> 16:49.190]  I know that none of you watch porn, but just in case you have any friends that do, you'll want to pay attention to this.
[16:49.410 --> 16:53.470]  With everything going on in the world, governments have increased their surveillance.
[16:54.030 --> 17:00.290]  They're using your devices to track your location, movements, and in many countries, your internet activity.
[17:00.810 --> 17:04.190]  You don't want to be literally caught with your pants down,
[17:04.190 --> 17:09.850]  and one of the best ways to keep your online browsing activity private is by using ExpressVPN.
[17:10.670 --> 17:14.570]  When you use ExpressVPN on your phone, computer, whatever,
[17:14.930 --> 17:18.550]  your internet connection is rerouted through a secure encrypted server,
[17:18.670 --> 17:23.550]  so you can surf the web more anonymously without anyone looking over your shoulder.
[17:23.950 --> 17:27.330]  Look, I know you think all you have to do is use incognito mode
[17:27.330 --> 17:31.910]  and no one can see that you've watched every last Hentai video on Pornhub,
[17:31.910 --> 17:35.770]  or include your own example of something private to do online.
[17:36.130 --> 17:37.590]  I wish I would have read that earlier.
[17:37.950 --> 17:38.870]  But you're wrong!
[17:39.330 --> 17:45.570]  Even when you use incognito mode, your internet provider can see every single website you visit.
[17:45.910 --> 17:49.490]  And if you live on campus or share Wi-Fi, your network admin can too.
[17:49.930 --> 17:51.490]  Now that's kinda scary.
[17:51.950 --> 17:57.790]  That's why I use ExpressVPN whenever I go online, and I recommend all of you do the same.
[17:57.790 --> 18:03.030]  With a single click of a button, ExpressVPN stops others from getting a free license
[18:03.030 --> 18:06.710]  to peek over your shoulder and see all the freaky shit you're looking at.
[18:07.010 --> 18:11.210]  So protect your privacy today and get three months of ExpressVPN for free.

[18:25.510 --> 18:29.290]  I have a thing, I don't know what it means, and I've been meaning to talk about it for two episodes now.
[18:29.490 --> 18:30.210]  Jingle, jingle, jingle?
[18:30.470 --> 18:33.630]  I was listening... I know what that means. And so do you.
[18:35.190 --> 18:40.330]  But, um, I was listening to... I was listening to something, and they brought up the phrase,
[18:40.750 --> 18:45.210]  the royal we. They're saying like, we, and then they pause, and they're like, well, the royal we.
[18:45.470 --> 18:49.370]  Isn't this on your album of ten episodes to record, though?
[18:49.450 --> 18:51.370]  I feel like I saw this on the notes you sent me.
[18:51.710 --> 18:52.090]  It is?
[18:52.090 --> 18:55.870]  So you're skipping ahead, you're going, you're breaking into the album content.
[18:56.390 --> 19:01.670]  Oh, no, wait. Time out. We had everything. This podcast is coming to a halt for a second.
[19:02.910 --> 19:05.090]  Those were... what are you talking about, Geoff?
[19:05.510 --> 19:08.210]  I thought we were holding off for like our marathon recording week.
[19:08.830 --> 19:11.130]  This is part of the marathon recording.
[19:11.730 --> 19:14.170]  I thought that started the first week of February is when we were going to do that.
[19:14.490 --> 19:16.950]  No, this is... what?
[19:17.110 --> 19:18.850]  I thought this was just the lead up to that.
[19:19.270 --> 19:19.890]  No, this is...
[19:19.890 --> 19:24.370]  I didn't consider this was... so this is... so is this, in your mind, song one or song two?
[19:24.530 --> 19:25.930]  We're in track two right now, Geoff.
[19:26.050 --> 19:28.030]  Track two. So last episode was track one.
[19:28.370 --> 19:29.610]  Last episode was track one.
[19:29.790 --> 19:34.430]  I had no idea we were even... we had even turned the CD player on.
[19:34.510 --> 19:40.130]  Why would we wait? Why would... why... we have to record... I didn't know how many we'd record. I thought we might record three.
[19:40.730 --> 19:42.050]  Geoff thought this was pleasantries.
[19:42.590 --> 19:43.910]  Geoff thought this was pleasantries.
[19:44.050 --> 19:48.990]  I thought this was the preamble to the album of recording we were going to do.
[19:48.990 --> 19:53.990]  You're saying that I'm jumping the gun. This was something I wrote for track one.
[19:54.430 --> 19:56.190]  Didn't even get used in track one.
[19:56.350 --> 19:58.110]  Almost all track one is available.
[19:58.430 --> 19:59.550]  Track three is the best though, right?
[20:00.010 --> 20:01.630]  Track three is always the best.
[20:01.670 --> 20:02.830]  Almost always. Almost always.
[20:03.090 --> 20:10.250]  I later wrote down in track one that I expected Geoff to start using the topics I sent him to fuck with me,
[20:10.330 --> 20:14.210]  which he ended up doing, but not realizing he was doing it. It was accidental.
[20:14.610 --> 20:16.470]  This is him not understanding the system.
[20:17.450 --> 20:20.710]  I thought we were going to open the show and Geoff was going to be like,
[20:20.730 --> 20:25.850]  since I sent him my notes for the first recording, he's immediately just going to go into what I sent him.
[20:26.050 --> 20:28.170]  Do you share notes now?
[20:28.510 --> 20:28.750]  No.
[20:29.290 --> 20:31.310]  Because of you.
[20:31.690 --> 20:32.890]  Yeah, it's because of you.
[20:33.530 --> 20:37.410]  We thought you would be gone for like eight months, and so I'm like,
[20:37.470 --> 20:42.470]  we're going to record 12 episodes in two weeks to cover for Gavin being busy.
[20:42.850 --> 20:46.830]  So I was like, I'm approaching this like I got to spread shit out.
[20:47.170 --> 20:50.150]  And so if we're trying to fill 12 or 13 episodes in a short time,
[20:50.250 --> 20:52.630]  I was like, we should send notes. We've never done this before.
[20:53.110 --> 20:54.670]  These are my notes.
[20:55.330 --> 20:56.610]  Why can't I see the notes?
[20:56.950 --> 20:57.990]  I don't know why you can't see them.
[20:57.990 --> 21:02.870]  Because you didn't reply to Jingle Jingle, honestly, because I felt weird to then follow up.
[21:02.890 --> 21:04.450]  You didn't get the notes because of that.
[21:04.570 --> 21:08.890]  If it helps, Gavin, I didn't send him shit. He just sent me the notes and I looked at him and went, okay.
[21:08.890 --> 21:13.330]  I wonder if we didn't record today with that Jingle Jingle Jingle would have been the last entry in our text.
[21:13.950 --> 21:14.590]  Potentially forever.
[21:17.190 --> 21:19.670]  Why are you planning on never responding after this?
[21:19.750 --> 21:20.250]  Who, me?
[21:20.710 --> 21:22.290]  Yeah, why would it be potentially forever?
[21:22.910 --> 21:25.650]  Because he didn't want to say anything after I didn't reply to Jingle Jingle Jingle.
[21:25.670 --> 21:30.970]  No, I would have replied. I would have replied today, but not in the... I felt like I had to wait for yesterday.
[21:30.970 --> 21:41.550]  Anyway, so we decided that if we have to plan 10 or 12 tracks worth of content, that it might behoove us to share notes just so that we can build out some more content.
[21:41.570 --> 21:43.710]  To make sure they're all equally, they have stuff in them.
[21:44.110 --> 21:51.050]  But it sounds like that's not really the case anyway, because you're not going to be gone as long as we thought or whatever.
[21:51.310 --> 21:54.310]  So I guess, I don't know what this does to your album structure.
[21:54.490 --> 21:57.790]  I don't think it'd be very good if we had to actually do like eight at once.
[21:58.250 --> 22:00.250]  What a fucking stupid conversation we just had.
[22:00.250 --> 22:03.470]  Well, I just wanted to talk about the Royal You. You did this.
[22:03.990 --> 22:09.870]  And not the Royal You. You. You specifically. Not the Royal Us. You. Just you.
[22:10.230 --> 22:10.270]  What?
[22:10.270 --> 22:10.970]  The Royal You.
[22:11.870 --> 22:15.530]  What do you mean? What are you confused about?
[22:16.410 --> 22:17.870]  No, Geoff. Not us.
[22:18.250 --> 22:20.570]  The Royal...
[22:21.110 --> 22:24.070]  When people say the Royal You, I don't know what it means, but I know what it means.
[22:24.890 --> 22:25.610]  Hang on!
[22:26.550 --> 22:29.610]  Wait, when you say the Royal You, you're just using a term you've heard?
[22:29.610 --> 22:31.910]  Well, that's sort of what I'm saying.
[22:32.210 --> 22:36.710]  I know... I know what it means when someone says...
[22:36.710 --> 22:38.990]  Okay, I'll just give the example in which I heard it.
[22:39.210 --> 22:41.610]  They said we. And then they paused.
[22:42.010 --> 22:44.290]  And then they said, well, not we. You know, the Royal We.
[22:44.710 --> 22:50.970]  The Royal We. The term the Royal We, I believe, means we as like a collective.
[22:51.110 --> 22:52.610]  Not specifically us.
[22:53.450 --> 22:55.470]  Just like a group that isn't us.
[22:55.770 --> 22:56.510]  Not us.
[22:56.510 --> 22:59.910]  But hypothetically us.
[23:00.010 --> 23:02.730]  Not us personally. Us as a group.
[23:03.790 --> 23:04.230]  Right?
[23:05.450 --> 23:07.730]  Does this make... Am I... Do I just not know?
[23:07.750 --> 23:09.310]  No, this is great. Keep going.
[23:09.430 --> 23:12.710]  I'm right. But I don't know why, I guess, is what I'm saying.
[23:13.190 --> 23:16.290]  Like, I don't... Is it at all connected to royalty?
[23:17.170 --> 23:20.290]  What is the Royal... Like, why is it the Royal We?
[23:20.410 --> 23:22.450]  Why is it the Royal what?
[23:22.790 --> 23:24.610]  I don't know. Like, I never questioned that.
[23:24.610 --> 23:32.990]  The Royal We, the first person plural used by a person with supreme authority, or in modern times, sometimes we preserve anonymity.
[23:33.570 --> 23:38.470]  Supposedly the first king to use we in this way was Richard I in the Charter to...
[23:38.470 --> 23:40.870]  Gavin knows all about this. Charter to Winchester 1190.
[23:41.410 --> 23:46.130]  I mean, I'm sure you could probably take off from there and just regale us with British knowledge.
[23:46.850 --> 23:48.370]  But I'll just keep going.
[23:48.490 --> 23:54.410]  We are not amused is a rebuke often attributed to straight-laced Queen Victoria in the 20th century.
[23:54.410 --> 23:56.150]  I'm putting myself to sleep reading this. Who cares?
[23:56.310 --> 23:58.870]  You are. I mean, this is very boring. I just don't know what it means.
[23:59.110 --> 24:03.130]  I've never... I don't know where the Royal comes from in the Royal We or the Royal You.
[24:03.770 --> 24:08.810]  I get the word that follows. The Royal part, I never understand why it's there and why it means what it means.
[24:09.610 --> 24:12.310]  And it sounds like I'm not alone. I don't think anyone here does.
[24:13.010 --> 24:17.370]  And that makes me feel better. I didn't know if it was a me thing or if that was just a thing that people didn't know.
[24:17.730 --> 24:20.690]  I don't know that I've ever heard anybody say the Royal You.
[24:22.810 --> 24:25.130]  Uh... yeah, that's less in use.
[24:25.950 --> 24:28.150]  I hear the Royal We all the time.
[24:28.210 --> 24:28.570]  Yeah.
[24:29.190 --> 24:33.070]  To include, like, a larger group.
[24:33.070 --> 24:36.950]  Yeah, You is very specific. That was a terrible example to use for it, but the Royal We.
[24:37.610 --> 24:42.590]  What if a You... I mean, sometimes You doesn't mean you, the person you're talking to.
[24:43.150 --> 24:43.730]  It doesn't?
[24:44.330 --> 24:50.670]  You can say, like, getting on a plane allows you to go skydiving, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna go skydiving.
[24:50.670 --> 24:55.030]  That's true. The Royal You is gonna go skydiving.
[24:56.290 --> 24:58.650]  The entire country jumps out of the plane.
[25:01.070 --> 25:06.810]  I don't know what, like, blood is thicker than water. I know what that means, but I don't know what, like, what, I don't...
[25:06.810 --> 25:06.990]  Huh?
[25:07.210 --> 25:09.990]  What does that mean? The expression, the phrase...
[25:09.990 --> 25:12.090]  Are you just listing off different expressions that you know?
[25:12.810 --> 25:20.010]  No, I don't know what they mean. It's like the Royal thing. I don't know what the Royal means. I don't know what any of that means either.
[25:20.010 --> 25:26.150]  Like, when you say, like, the Royal We, I think it harkens back to, like, everybody in the kingdom, right?
[25:26.530 --> 25:30.710]  Like, everybody under the... everybody in the serfdom or whatever of that royalty.
[25:31.410 --> 25:31.910]  Okay.
[25:32.110 --> 25:34.710]  It's kind of the etymology of that.
[25:35.010 --> 25:43.630]  There's an example on Wikipedia where there's basically, like, a land dispute and the king writes that, you know, we have arrived at this decision, blah, blah, blah.
[25:43.810 --> 25:46.230]  Is blood water? What is blood made of?
[25:46.830 --> 25:48.690]  It's water, right? It's the water base.
[25:48.690 --> 25:51.690]  Blood has water in it. Everything has water in it.
[25:51.930 --> 25:57.730]  Everything... that was going to be my next... I realized that I don't know what blood is. It's water. And every liquid is water?
[25:58.530 --> 26:03.350]  Well, there's different amounts of water in different liquids. Probably less in syrup or oil.
[26:03.350 --> 26:06.530]  But it's all... all forms of liquid have water in them.
[26:07.170 --> 26:08.090]  I would say so.
[26:09.230 --> 26:09.710]  Well...
[26:09.710 --> 26:09.850]  Maybe not.
[26:10.130 --> 26:14.050]  Maybe not like certain gases in liquid form.
[26:14.850 --> 26:15.170]  Huh.
[26:15.750 --> 26:17.690]  Yeah, things can be in a liquid state.
[26:17.690 --> 26:21.650]  Like liquid nitrogen doesn't have water in it.
[26:21.890 --> 26:22.930]  How thick is blood?
[26:23.110 --> 26:23.950]  It's viscous.
[26:24.090 --> 26:25.690]  Is water in...
[26:25.690 --> 26:28.370]  It's just a weird expression.
[26:28.970 --> 26:33.450]  Because I would... blood is thicker than water, but it's not... it's not thicker than gravy.
[26:36.570 --> 26:39.030]  Depends on... depends on the gravy, though.
[26:39.570 --> 26:41.190]  That's true, I guess.
[26:41.450 --> 26:46.930]  It's definitely not thicker than, like, white sausage biscuit gravy.
[26:46.930 --> 26:48.250]  But it might be thicker...
[26:48.250 --> 26:50.810]  You're not gonna get the money. You're not even related to him by gravy.
[26:54.590 --> 26:57.230]  And by the way, the answer is no, according to the internet.
[26:57.410 --> 27:01.250]  Water is one of many liquids, but not necessarily all liquids.
[27:01.850 --> 27:03.190]  Okay. Thank you.
[27:04.450 --> 27:06.630]  Mercury has no water in it when it's in liquid form.
[27:07.410 --> 27:07.710]  Huh.
[27:08.210 --> 27:11.450]  Yeah, I guess any base element, if it doesn't have hydrogen or oxygen, there's no water in it.
[27:12.810 --> 27:13.530]  Okay. Okay.
[27:13.990 --> 27:16.690]  I was gonna say something dumb. I'm not going to. We're gonna move past it.
[27:16.690 --> 27:18.530]  You were gonna say something dumb.
[27:20.430 --> 27:21.530]  Yeah, it's fine.
[27:22.290 --> 27:24.910]  You ever... you ever fuck up and then nobody notices?
[27:25.070 --> 27:26.230]  That was not one of those times.
[27:26.950 --> 27:28.110]  You had one of those recently?
[27:28.590 --> 27:30.770]  Where, like, you royally fucked something up?
[27:31.090 --> 27:32.650]  Royally, ha. That was an accident.
[27:33.010 --> 27:33.730]  I'm proud of that one.
[27:35.390 --> 27:38.790]  Bounce back from the bread clip, baby. Drop it in a royally.
[27:39.630 --> 27:40.070]  Accidentally.
[27:42.070 --> 27:46.390]  For the audience, he's referencing the bread clip joke that fell flat last episode.
[27:46.390 --> 27:49.390]  A week ago for you, but about 30 minutes ago for us.
[27:49.670 --> 27:49.990]  Yes.
[27:51.950 --> 27:52.910]  I, uh...
[27:54.110 --> 27:55.170]  What's going on, Gavin?
[27:56.070 --> 28:00.010]  I just can't believe how much that tripped you up.
[28:00.330 --> 28:03.950]  I thought it was a fine comment. You really just dwelled on that bread clip part.
[28:04.110 --> 28:06.510]  You got in your head about it pretty hard.
[28:06.510 --> 28:11.150]  No, you guys weren't there. You didn't deliver it.
[28:11.150 --> 28:18.390]  I was apparently messing up left and right last episode. Like, my O's weren't good. I wasn't laughing at the bread clip comment.
[28:18.730 --> 28:21.270]  You had a terrible O. It was brutal.
[28:21.430 --> 28:21.990]  I had a bad O.
[28:22.170 --> 28:27.490]  If that was the example of O, I would have it taken out of the... I would just have it removed as a letter.
[28:27.710 --> 28:30.870]  I'd be like, we don't need it. We'll go down to 25. Not if that's what it's gonna be.
[28:31.750 --> 28:33.550]  It felt like... I don't know.
[28:33.890 --> 28:39.610]  Like, if you throw a Hail Mary and everybody's like, oh man, is it gonna land?
[28:39.650 --> 28:41.790]  And you threw it out of the stadium, is how it felt like.
[28:41.870 --> 28:44.950]  Like, not only did it not land, but it couldn't have missed further.
[28:45.650 --> 28:49.610]  It was three layers, so who knows how many seats it's...
[28:49.610 --> 28:51.970]  It leaves a lot of room to guess.
[28:55.390 --> 28:56.190]  Go ahead.
[28:56.930 --> 28:58.330]  No, I'm just gonna...
[28:58.870 --> 28:59.750]  You're in a weird hole.
[29:00.310 --> 29:03.270]  I just don't know where... I don't know where you're going.
[29:03.990 --> 29:07.750]  I was trying to get into... we pivoted into weird... I fucked up recently.
[29:07.750 --> 29:11.030]  Are you talking about when you try and hide that you've made a mistake?
[29:11.210 --> 29:13.430]  Or that you just get away with it without even doing anything?
[29:13.730 --> 29:13.850]  Both.
[29:14.290 --> 29:16.370]  How often do you get away with it?
[29:16.470 --> 29:23.110]  Not often, but when it does happen, there's that moment of like, you start sweating that someone's gonna call you on it.
[29:23.290 --> 29:26.970]  I had a really bad one recently, so I'm bringing it up. I'm just curious if you have had those.
[29:26.970 --> 29:29.990]  This is one that I think will stick with me for a while.
[29:30.870 --> 29:34.150]  I mean, I think everybody probably has had those at some point in their life.
[29:34.170 --> 29:35.710]  But why don't you dive into this one?
[29:35.930 --> 29:37.450]  I was reading the Donkey Kong rap.
[29:37.910 --> 29:38.570]  This one does.
[29:39.170 --> 29:40.470]  Talking about the Donkey Kong rap.
[29:40.670 --> 29:48.430]  And it's funny because in the Donkey Kong rap, the first two verses are all very complimentary.
[29:48.930 --> 29:51.930]  It's like, Donkey Kong is great. It's talking about how great Donkey Kong is.
[29:52.430 --> 29:53.590]  Then the next Kong, they're great.
[29:53.590 --> 29:58.210]  And then it goes to Lanky Kong, and the Lanky Kong verse is just shitting on Lanky Kong.
[29:58.390 --> 30:00.610]  Well, he has no style. He has no grace.
[30:01.330 --> 30:02.830]  This Kong has a funny face.
[30:03.210 --> 30:07.090]  Like, they're just fucking shitting on Lanky Kong.
[30:07.270 --> 30:08.290]  He doesn't get a great verse.
[30:08.610 --> 30:10.170]  And so I was trying to prove that point.
[30:10.550 --> 30:14.130]  So I was reading the lyrics to it.
[30:14.530 --> 30:17.190]  And I got to the Lanky Kong part.
[30:17.850 --> 30:22.110]  And, uh, I should have... I should have wrote this down.
[30:22.110 --> 30:25.770]  But essentially it ends with, This Kong really digs this tune.
[30:26.290 --> 30:27.830]  Is the end of the lyric. Something like that.
[30:27.870 --> 30:29.210]  It ends with tune is the final word.
[30:29.750 --> 30:31.870]  I misread the exclamation as an L.
[30:32.030 --> 30:34.390]  And I said, This Kong really digs this tunnel.
[30:38.090 --> 30:40.450]  Not only was it spelled wrong if it was tunnel.
[30:40.890 --> 30:44.310]  But I said this to a group of eight people.
[30:44.470 --> 30:47.990]  But it was within the context of me talking about how shit the verse is.
[30:48.370 --> 30:51.610]  So I was like, This Kong really digs this tunnel.
[30:52.570 --> 30:56.330]  And somebody went, Tunnel?
[30:58.510 --> 31:02.510]  And I immediately realized as soon as I said it.
[31:02.570 --> 31:05.130]  Now I fucked up tune with the exclamation.
[31:05.850 --> 31:07.470]  And turned it to be Tunel.
[31:07.950 --> 31:10.250]  Based on how I had read it.
[31:10.470 --> 31:11.490]  And just nobody noticed.
[31:11.730 --> 31:12.630]  Nobody called on it.
[31:12.690 --> 31:14.010]  They're just like, Yeah, I guess that is.
[31:14.070 --> 31:15.190]  Wow, what a weird rhyme.
[31:15.490 --> 31:18.070]  Nobody said anything.
[31:18.450 --> 31:20.750]  It registered that tunnel didn't at all fit.
[31:20.750 --> 31:22.850]  But because of how much talk was said.
[31:22.950 --> 31:24.450]  About how shitty the verse was.
[31:24.570 --> 31:26.370]  And that it didn't flow very well.
[31:26.570 --> 31:27.470]  When did you realize?
[31:27.610 --> 31:28.070]  Later on?
[31:28.190 --> 31:28.910]  After the conversation?
[31:29.230 --> 31:30.750]  Oh, as soon as the L.
[31:30.930 --> 31:33.030]  As soon as the L in Tunnel left my mouth.
[31:33.090 --> 31:34.150]  I realized what I had done.
[31:34.510 --> 31:36.270]  So you could have just corrected yourself.
[31:36.550 --> 31:36.810]  Immediately.
[31:37.310 --> 31:39.230]  So I thought about it.
[31:39.670 --> 31:41.530]  And then because I thought about it.
[31:41.570 --> 31:42.710]  Too much time had passed.
[31:43.070 --> 31:44.990]  By the time it came to make that decision.
[31:45.210 --> 31:46.790]  It was like eight seconds had passed.
[31:46.870 --> 31:48.850]  And am I really going to like, Hey, I need to.
[31:49.130 --> 31:50.310]  We need to go back to that.
[31:50.310 --> 31:51.130]  Let me explain.
[31:51.270 --> 31:52.490]  The moment had passed.
[31:52.550 --> 31:53.790]  I didn't feel like I could correct it.
[31:53.890 --> 31:55.430]  It wasn't like the bread clip.
[31:55.490 --> 31:56.090]  Or me.
[31:56.690 --> 31:57.130]  Saying.
[31:57.550 --> 31:58.730]  My dynasty being.
[31:58.870 --> 31:59.170]  Or whatever.
[31:59.350 --> 31:59.650]  I fucking.
[31:59.910 --> 32:00.790]  Whatever that was.
[32:02.290 --> 32:03.510]  Too much time had passed.
[32:03.650 --> 32:04.410]  The moment had passed.
[32:04.470 --> 32:05.250]  So I couldn't correct it.
[32:05.290 --> 32:05.850]  So this is curious.
[32:05.990 --> 32:06.290]  It's been.
[32:06.570 --> 32:07.930]  That happened four days ago.
[32:08.090 --> 32:09.470]  I think about it constantly.
[32:09.710 --> 32:10.870]  It hasn't left my brain.
[32:11.370 --> 32:13.610]  This Kong really digs this tunnel.
[32:14.010 --> 32:14.950]  So looking at the lyrics.
[32:15.410 --> 32:16.570]  The end of that verse is.
[32:16.830 --> 32:17.610]  Inflate himself.
[32:18.030 --> 32:19.550]  Just like a balloon.
[32:19.550 --> 32:22.890]  This crazy Kong just digs this tune.
[32:22.970 --> 32:23.530]  So yeah.
[32:23.550 --> 32:24.290]  He would have said.
[32:24.890 --> 32:27.550]  He would have had to have inflated himself like a balloonel.
[32:38.030 --> 32:39.150]  It was bad.
[32:39.750 --> 32:41.170]  It's haunted me.
[32:41.390 --> 32:42.150]  So I was just curious.
[32:45.450 --> 32:47.710]  I was curious if either of you had that recently.
[32:48.150 --> 32:50.050]  I used to love that Donkey Kong rap.
[32:50.430 --> 32:52.050]  Can I ask you guys a question?
[32:52.050 --> 32:52.370]  It's terrible.
[32:52.870 --> 32:54.030]  Where does it come from?
[32:54.670 --> 32:55.670]  Donkey Kong 64.
[32:56.050 --> 32:56.550]  Oh, it's like.
[32:56.690 --> 32:57.210]  It's this.
[32:57.350 --> 32:58.750]  Is it from the soundtrack of the game?
[32:59.070 --> 33:01.450]  It's like the first thing that happens when you turn the game on.
[33:01.850 --> 33:02.350]  Oh, okay.
[33:02.770 --> 33:03.370]  I never played it.
[33:03.570 --> 33:04.130]  So I don't know.
[33:04.370 --> 33:04.550]  Okay.
[33:04.570 --> 33:04.830]  Gotcha.
[33:05.370 --> 33:06.130]  We have a bet.
[33:06.630 --> 33:07.770]  We have a Donkey Kong bet.
[33:08.270 --> 33:09.450]  We haven't talked to you about Geoff.
[33:09.930 --> 33:12.430]  You're going to have an opportunity to experience Donkey Kong.
[33:12.470 --> 33:13.910]  That is part of the redemption year.
[33:14.430 --> 33:14.650]  Okay.
[33:14.850 --> 33:15.010]  So I.
[33:15.550 --> 33:15.870]  Gavin.
[33:16.170 --> 33:17.610]  Gavin's like childhood game.
[33:18.150 --> 33:19.850]  And we talked about it on the show at the time.
[33:20.370 --> 33:20.730]  Loved it.
[33:20.790 --> 33:21.310]  Loved it.
[33:21.310 --> 33:22.710]  He could never beat it.
[33:22.770 --> 33:24.090]  So then I was like, you know what?
[33:24.110 --> 33:25.190]  I'm going to finish it.
[33:25.270 --> 33:28.410]  I even made a Twitch account at that time called Andrew the Donkey Kong guy.
[33:28.810 --> 33:30.070]  And then I got far.
[33:30.190 --> 33:31.830]  I got 80% of the way through the game.
[33:32.190 --> 33:33.930]  And then I lost my save file.
[33:34.070 --> 33:34.950]  It just vanished.
[33:35.190 --> 33:35.790]  It crashed.
[33:35.990 --> 33:36.650]  And there's a lot.
[33:36.830 --> 33:38.190]  There's a lot to do in that game.
[33:38.490 --> 33:41.550]  And so I've been thinking about giving it another try.
[33:41.830 --> 33:42.790]  But I can't just.
[33:42.950 --> 33:44.410]  It's not the greatest of games.
[33:44.610 --> 33:46.170]  It's not all that much fun to play.
[33:47.110 --> 33:49.210]  People speak of it so fondly though.
[33:49.210 --> 33:51.410]  I think it's a nostalgia thing, but it's not.
[33:51.570 --> 33:52.330]  It's not a great game.
[33:53.250 --> 33:56.150]  So I thought, if I'm going to do this again, there needs to be odds.
[33:56.530 --> 33:58.830]  We need to have something on the line for it.
[33:58.830 --> 34:01.990]  So I pitched Gavin a Donkey Kong bet.
[34:02.070 --> 34:02.930]  I will stream.
[34:03.050 --> 34:05.110]  I will do everything like I did before.
[34:05.190 --> 34:05.830]  I'll stream it again.
[34:05.830 --> 34:10.470]  But this time on the FFacePod Twitch account, which is the thing we have, but I've never used.
[34:11.030 --> 34:11.950]  I'll stream it.
[34:12.410 --> 34:14.090]  I have 48 hours to beat it.
[34:14.450 --> 34:17.350]  And I plan on just trying to play as much as I can continuously.
[34:17.450 --> 34:19.110]  To beat it or 100% it?
[34:19.110 --> 34:20.010]  To finish it.
[34:20.070 --> 34:20.890]  Not 100% it.
[34:20.970 --> 34:21.450]  To finish it.
[34:21.770 --> 34:24.150]  So you're just going to beat K. Rool at the end?
[34:24.530 --> 34:24.850]  I do.
[34:24.930 --> 34:26.410]  I have to hit credits or whatever.
[34:26.710 --> 34:26.970]  Okay.
[34:27.050 --> 34:27.890]  To beat the final boss.
[34:27.990 --> 34:28.870]  At any percent?
[34:29.390 --> 34:30.190]  At any percent.
[34:30.590 --> 34:32.090]  How long is it supposed to take to finish?
[34:32.450 --> 34:35.190]  Apparently like 30 hours is the average playthrough.
[34:36.170 --> 34:36.570]  Okay.
[34:37.170 --> 34:39.210]  So you've got 48 hours.
[34:39.990 --> 34:43.470]  Now here's something, when we discussed on text, we were sort of figuring it out.
[34:43.490 --> 34:46.230]  I was trying to think of ways you could, well, cheat basically.
[34:46.670 --> 34:46.810]  Yeah.
[34:46.910 --> 34:48.030]  Pull an Android.
[34:48.030 --> 34:48.750]  I have no plans.
[34:48.910 --> 34:52.330]  Are you allowed to use glitches or skips?
[34:52.370 --> 34:52.610]  No.
[34:53.090 --> 34:53.350]  Okay.
[34:53.510 --> 34:54.070]  You're just going to play.
[34:54.470 --> 34:54.690]  Yeah.
[34:55.030 --> 34:58.710]  If one happens accidentally, I don't think that disqualifies me.
[34:59.010 --> 35:01.490]  Like if I'm jumping through a wall and I just like end up through it.
[35:01.810 --> 35:02.690]  I don't think that.
[35:02.790 --> 35:07.350]  If it's a bug or a glitch that helps me, but it's done accidentally, I think I'm fine.
[35:07.710 --> 35:13.370]  And you'll be using Earth hours, not like lunar or like Martian hours.
[35:13.890 --> 35:15.890]  I'll be using Earth hours.
[35:16.250 --> 35:16.510]  Okay.
[35:16.930 --> 35:18.690]  So you've got 48 Earth hours.
[35:19.150 --> 35:19.390]  Yeah.
[35:19.590 --> 35:21.170]  We need to, I guess, figure out.
[35:21.650 --> 35:22.530]  I'm not sure when I'll...
[35:22.530 --> 35:23.910]  You're going to have to cheat somehow.
[35:24.030 --> 35:26.330]  And I'm just trying to think ahead of how you're going to...
[35:26.330 --> 35:27.510]  I'm either going to cheat or lose.
[35:27.610 --> 35:30.070]  And that's where we come to the stakes of this bet.
[35:30.130 --> 35:31.590]  Because every bet needs stakes.
[35:32.250 --> 35:33.230]  I have a victory thing.
[35:33.290 --> 35:36.650]  We can talk about this because Gavin doesn't know I had this idea for it.
[35:37.970 --> 35:40.790]  If I lose, this is what we came up with.
[35:40.810 --> 35:41.910]  We can workshop this.
[35:41.990 --> 35:43.290]  I'd like to hear your thoughts on it, Geoff.
[35:43.570 --> 35:45.090]  You know my feelings on bananas.
[35:45.090 --> 35:50.550]  If I lose this bet, I have to eat a banana every day for the next 64 days.
[35:50.750 --> 35:51.670]  You know what?
[35:51.970 --> 35:53.950]  First off, I think that makes sense in a lot of ways.
[35:54.010 --> 35:55.310]  But I'm glad you brought up bananas.
[35:55.530 --> 36:01.470]  I went ahead and closed down my banana research because I didn't think we'd ever get back to bananas.
[36:01.530 --> 36:03.390]  But I did a little bit of reading on bananas.
[36:03.790 --> 36:12.670]  Did you know there are over a thousand varieties of banana that vary wildly in taste and consistency?
[36:12.670 --> 36:16.230]  I think that there probably is a banana out there for you, Andrew.
[36:16.430 --> 36:23.590]  You just haven't found it because you're eating the Cavendish banana, which is by far the most common available banana.
[36:23.810 --> 36:24.670]  That's very possible.
[36:25.350 --> 36:26.610]  You could totally be right.
[36:26.710 --> 36:28.550]  And I don't mind the taste. It's really a texture thing.
[36:29.090 --> 36:34.330]  Assuming there's a range in the same way Apple's has, there's a scenario in which I could all of a sudden like a banana.
[36:34.670 --> 36:36.530]  Probably just an obscure banana.
[36:36.530 --> 36:41.130]  I'd have to eat 64 bananas in a row every day.
[36:41.910 --> 36:45.510]  I'd be open to recording that process and I don't know if we could... it would be terrible.
[36:45.850 --> 36:48.050]  But something could maybe come from that when it's done.
[36:48.730 --> 36:51.590]  Now can you rate every banana in the moment as you eat it?
[36:51.790 --> 36:52.470]  I could.
[36:52.970 --> 36:54.030]  For 64 bananas?
[36:54.710 --> 36:55.390]  Eric just said wait.
[36:55.930 --> 36:58.670]  Hang on, I'm confused. I just want to get clarification.
[36:59.270 --> 37:02.470]  You're saying you have to eat 64 bananas in one day?
[37:02.730 --> 37:06.030]  No, I have to eat one banana a day for 64 days.
[37:06.030 --> 37:06.730]  Oh, okay.
[37:06.890 --> 37:09.170]  It was confusing the way he said it, Eric.
[37:09.190 --> 37:12.470]  Okay, cool. Because I thought you were going to die from potassium poisoning.
[37:12.690 --> 37:14.770]  So I wanted to make sure I wasn't part of that.
[37:14.970 --> 37:15.050]  No, no, no.
[37:15.050 --> 37:15.150]  Thank you.
[37:15.210 --> 37:15.670]  No, no, no.
[37:15.730 --> 37:16.610]  Once a day.
[37:18.590 --> 37:21.190]  One banana a day for 64 days.
[37:21.510 --> 37:23.730]  And you were originally telling me this is like the punishment.
[37:23.970 --> 37:27.790]  And I was just thinking like, I could easily do that and it wouldn't be a punishment.
[37:28.670 --> 37:32.250]  And then I remembered how much you hate bananas and I just thought that's absolutely perfect.
[37:32.610 --> 37:34.290]  Because you're going to get so sick of them.
[37:34.290 --> 37:37.230]  Like a week in, you're just going to be like, dreading your daily banana.
[37:37.870 --> 37:40.090]  So this is the idea I had. We could workshop.
[37:40.610 --> 37:43.090]  We can workshop this, but this is just my original thought.
[37:43.570 --> 37:49.790]  If I win the bet, I was trying to think of things because it's complicated to come up with a victory thing for me.
[37:50.530 --> 37:51.530]  I'll give you a free skateboard.
[37:52.150 --> 37:53.650]  Free skateboard? No.
[37:54.350 --> 37:59.830]  If I win the bet, because you, you also, you do this podcast and you also do the RT podcast.
[38:00.270 --> 38:03.090]  Which is a visual, there's a video component to that show.
[38:03.090 --> 38:04.130]  You're speaking to Gavin.
[38:04.350 --> 38:05.610]  I'm speaking to Gavin.
[38:06.070 --> 38:14.030]  If I win this bet, you have to record an episode of the RT podcast wearing 64 different pieces of clothing.
[38:14.030 --> 38:16.230]  I like this.
[38:19.030 --> 38:20.350]  Yes, yes, yes.
[38:21.210 --> 38:21.950]  Yeah, all right, Joey.
[38:23.610 --> 38:25.870]  How is that? Where'd you get that from?
[38:26.190 --> 38:28.890]  You got to pick 64 coats, I'm going to die of heat stroke.
[38:29.390 --> 38:32.090]  I pick one. I can pick one piece of the 64.
[38:32.610 --> 38:33.890]  You can pick the rest.
[38:34.050 --> 38:37.530]  Okay, I have to... a whole 90 minutes?
[38:37.850 --> 38:38.910]  A whole 90 minutes.
[38:39.110 --> 38:43.750]  Can I wear one of those beer helmets with water for hydration?
[38:44.170 --> 38:44.790]  Yes, absolutely.
[38:44.790 --> 38:46.450]  Because I'm going to have restricted limb movement.
[38:46.530 --> 38:47.310]  Yeah, no, you can.
[38:47.730 --> 38:48.650]  That's an article of clothing.
[38:50.090 --> 38:53.210]  Ooh, what if I just, what if I just wear like 30 ties?
[38:53.870 --> 38:58.570]  Then you'd have, you'd need to come up with 34 more items of clothing to go with it.
[38:59.350 --> 38:59.590]  Hmm.
[39:00.270 --> 39:01.410]  Do you have 30 ties?
[39:02.190 --> 39:03.850]  No, I've got two.
[39:06.430 --> 39:09.190]  What's wrong with two? Who needs more than two ties?
[39:09.550 --> 39:10.410]  No, I agree, I agree.
[39:10.550 --> 39:10.710]  Oh.
[39:11.410 --> 39:12.510]  I'm not arguing.
[39:13.210 --> 39:24.550]  Oh, man. I like the terms. I certainly, as an impartial judge or just an impartial observer, I would certainly sign off on those terms.
[39:24.830 --> 39:27.470]  Eric is asking, is jewelry clothes? Jewelry is not clothing.
[39:27.470 --> 39:36.690]  I think it's, I think the biggest problem here is that it's really easy for Andrew to beat a 30-hour game in a 48-hour window. I don't know why that's difficult.
[39:37.330 --> 39:40.570]  I don't, well, it's difficult if I only do that, like, what do you mean?
[39:41.050 --> 39:42.450]  Is it hard? Is the game hard?
[39:42.670 --> 39:48.210]  Yes. It's a tedious, difficult, there are parts of it that are very difficult. That's why Gavin never beat it.
[39:48.290 --> 39:52.130]  I mean, he will have to beat original Donkey Kong again on the arcade.
[39:52.970 --> 39:59.170]  Yeah, and there's the slide thing I have to do. That's a fucking nightmare. There are a few parts of that game that are incredibly difficult.
[39:59.210 --> 40:05.350]  Yeah, it's not, uh, it's not that easy. It's not hard. There's just some really, like, there's some sticking points in it.
[40:05.410 --> 40:10.710]  I just feel like he was going to spend that 30 hours playing Halo anyway, so now he's just going to switch to a different console.
[40:11.330 --> 40:12.990]  I don't understand your point.
[40:13.050 --> 40:15.370]  Are you saying 48 hours is maybe too long?
[40:15.690 --> 40:19.650]  I think it's too much time. That gives him two 9-hour sleeping sessions.
[40:19.650 --> 40:22.110]  But there's no life outside of that.
[40:22.570 --> 40:26.830]  Yeah, you get a 15-hour day of playing. Video games is your life. We love it.
[40:27.830 --> 40:30.110]  What's the longest video game stint you've had, ever?
[40:31.310 --> 40:32.190]  Ever? Um...
[40:32.190 --> 40:32.350]  Yeah.
[40:33.830 --> 40:42.550]  I don't, I'd have to, probably, like, six or seven, probably like eight hours when I was playing Halo 2 and I'd stay up all night playing it.
[40:43.570 --> 40:45.230]  Well, I guess that's probably the longest.
[40:45.230 --> 40:52.770]  You know, I feel like... I feel like you can do this. To be honest, I'm sick of you losing the bets.
[40:53.070 --> 40:59.030]  Wow, no, I don't want a pity bet. I beat you in the Halo bet.
[40:59.270 --> 41:03.850]  I want you to have a decent chance, and you've never had a chance with the burgers. Ever.
[41:04.170 --> 41:08.510]  Reduce it to 44 hours. I'm not taking any pity victories.
[41:08.530 --> 41:13.610]  No, no, no, listen, we're not, nobody's trying, I'm just saying, Gavin, if I were you, I would start collecting ties.
[41:13.610 --> 41:23.350]  What if, what if you're allowed, it's 44 hours, but you're allowed to purchase an extra four hours for free?
[41:23.630 --> 41:27.390]  You can have them, but you have to make that call in the first 24 hours.
[41:27.810 --> 41:28.290]  Okay.
[41:28.890 --> 41:29.190]  Okay.
[41:29.570 --> 41:30.910]  Why wouldn't I make that call, though?
[41:31.690 --> 41:38.810]  Yeah, well, you know, it's just, uh, whether you wanna, whether you wanna give up on doing it in 44 pretty early.
[41:39.210 --> 41:41.730]  Okay, so it's a pride thing. I can get behind that.
[41:41.730 --> 41:47.390]  Because I think the only real, the only person you're battling half the time is yourself and your own confidence.
[41:47.930 --> 41:48.230]  It's true.
[41:49.290 --> 41:50.830]  It is true. Yeah.
[41:50.850 --> 41:51.150]  It is true.
[41:51.790 --> 41:55.610]  Do you wanna hear a really embarrassing story of my confidence? I hadn't thought about until recently.
[41:55.610 --> 41:56.910]  Is it related to the Denver Nuggets?
[41:57.550 --> 42:10.330]  It's related to sports. This is like, I think this might be, I was gonna say when I told the story, this is maybe the first example of burger confidence, but that's not true, there were previous instances, but this is classic burger confidence.
[42:10.330 --> 42:15.570]  I'm in the fourth grade, I wanna say, at this time, and I don't know how to ice skate.
[42:16.430 --> 42:34.090]  I'm not an ice skater. I don't know how to rollerblade, but the local hockey team came to our class that day, and they were like doing a thing where it's like, ah, we're going around the schools, you meet the team, they hang out, they help you with some of the assignments, and then at the end of the day, you get to play hockey with the team.
[42:34.090 --> 42:46.030]  It's just, it either means skates or just run, in the gym. I had convinced myself as a child that there is a scenario in which I could join the hockey team based off of this experience.
[42:47.210 --> 42:59.350]  I was sat at my desk at lunch being like, what if I'm so good at, I don't like hockey, I never play hockey, but in my head, I was convinced, like, what if I happen to be so good at ice hockey? It's not even ice hockey, it's floor hockey.
[42:59.730 --> 43:02.290]  And you hadn't seen a movie with a monkey on ice skates?
[43:02.290 --> 43:15.210]  No, I have. MVP1 is about a monkey playing ice hockey. Maybe it's all tied to MVP, my confidence. It's all ice skating and monkey related.
[43:15.510 --> 43:26.330]  But I thought, I genuinely believed that there was a possibility that they would ask me to join the team based off of my hockey playing. I was dreadful. I didn't like it. I was just bad at hockey.
[43:26.330 --> 43:40.990]  I didn't know how to skate. They're a nice hockey team. I didn't know how to skate. But I spent a large portion of that day completely convinced that it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that I would be joining the Nanaimo Clippers and what that would mean for that future.
[43:41.750 --> 43:45.450]  As a Clipper. I was also like six years younger than all of them.
[43:46.010 --> 43:49.430]  But did you actually get to the point where you were like, putting skates on or anything?
[43:49.430 --> 44:01.670]  No, we did. So at the end of the day, we played hockey and the kids that could roller blade got put on roller blades and that was not me. So I was just slowly running around the gym being terrible at hockey.
[44:01.910 --> 44:03.130]  So you're on foot?
[44:03.530 --> 44:16.830]  I'm on foot. Yeah, because I don't know how to skate on any level. Roller skate or ice skate. Don't know how to do it. Terrible at it. So I'm just slowly running while everybody's skating by me. And I'm just bad. I'm bad at every level of the game.
[44:16.830 --> 44:31.010]  But I spent a few hours that day convinced that I was going to be the next Nanaimo Clipper. And it was a dream that I never had prior to that or cared about the day after. I never played hockey. That's genuinely, I think, the last time I played hockey. It just appeared.
[44:31.390 --> 44:32.090]  Can I ask a question?
[44:32.530 --> 44:32.970]  Of course.
[44:33.670 --> 44:38.470]  What track is that on? The Nanaimo Clippers hockey story?
[44:39.450 --> 44:43.390]  What do you mean what track? Oh, this is not on. It's not even on the list.
[44:43.510 --> 44:45.570]  Oh, shit. This is like bonus. This is a B-side.
[44:46.390 --> 44:51.370]  Geoff, you have no idea how excited I was that we went so heavy on knobs in track one and that was not on the list.
[44:52.250 --> 45:00.530]  I'm confused as to why Geoff thought we weren't on track one yet. Like, were you just what were you what were you doing in the last episode? Just like trying not to tell a story?
[45:00.930 --> 45:09.530]  No, no, no, no. I wasn't a part of Andrew's album structure thing. He presented this to me last night or yesterday. And we were just talking about how...
[45:10.210 --> 45:18.570]  See, the way the way it went down is we knew you were going to be taken off at some point. Nobody knew how long. I had had the conversation with you at dinner, had an inkling.
[45:19.230 --> 45:27.090]  Eric came to us and said, hey, we need to schedule ahead. Gavin's going to be gone for a while. And we said, like, how much? And he said, probably as much as we can get.
[45:27.090 --> 45:37.650]  And then Andrew came up with 10 episodes. And I got it in my head because he said, I think we can record 10 episodes in one week. And Eric identified the first week of February as a good time to do it.
[45:38.030 --> 45:46.110]  So in my head, those 10 episodes were their own thing. Today does not comprise is today is not the first week of February. It is still January 20th or something.
[45:46.110 --> 45:59.330]  So I was like, I was considering that to be something that we're going to do, you know, 11 days from now. Right now, I just thought we were going to do our normal episode and then bang out an extra one because we had the time.
[45:59.470 --> 46:11.950]  And then we would be approaching the album of content on that week, much like we did Hell Week when you left to go film Lazer Team so many years ago in Achievement Hunt. I just didn't think it had started yet.
[46:11.950 --> 46:22.990]  I think it would be detrimental to do three in a day. I agree. I think it's detrimental to do two in a day sometimes. OK, so that's not true. I don't think that I don't know why I said that.
[46:23.110 --> 46:31.210]  That was that was like, I don't know. I actually I actually like it. I'm having more fun doing this episode than the last episode. I had a lot of fun doing the last episode.
[46:31.310 --> 46:39.030]  So and I recorded and I recorded an episode of Annual Pass 15 minutes before this. So this is my third episode today and I'm having a blast.
[46:39.030 --> 46:47.910]  Well, let me ask you, Geoff, how are the pleasantries before Annual Pass? Fucking awesome. Awesome. Yeah, dude, that's a whole different vibe there.
[46:48.050 --> 46:59.690]  It's me and Jack and Ben, and it's just like a big dude bear hug. It is just nothing but pleasantries. It's a really easy way to roll into a podcast that's also very warm and positive, very different from us.
[47:02.350 --> 47:10.890]  I think we can be both those things, but rarely simultaneously. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think we have very, very great moments of warmth.
[47:11.410 --> 47:18.570]  Is the Donkey Kong bit, is that a part of the album? Yeah, that was on track one. That was track one. OK, so we're bouncing around. All right.
[47:18.570 --> 47:29.070]  When are you going to start that then? I like it. Why don't we start? I don't know when this airs. Whenever this airs, one week from then. OK, so it's going to come out the next episode?
[47:31.130 --> 47:40.050]  Uh, the results of it, I guess, would come out probably a year later. Yeah, when does this air? What day is it right now for us?
[47:41.790 --> 47:51.070]  Well, I'm waiting for Eric or Nick to tell us. Yeah, I'm waiting for somebody to tell us. This will be February 9th. February 9th? OK, what about the following... Episode 89, February 9th.
[47:51.370 --> 47:59.250]  So not that weekend, but the following weekend, I will start it Saturday, 12 a.m. And I have until... I have 40 hours from that point.
[47:59.630 --> 48:04.390]  Are you going to be doing commentary? Are you going to be... Yeah, I'll do some. I'll do some commentary.
[48:04.390 --> 48:13.590]  You're going to stream the whole thing? All of the hours? Yeah, we'll say I'll stream the whole thing. Maybe I won't do commentary necessarily for all of it, but I'll try to do for the most of it, the bulk of it.
[48:13.590 --> 48:20.650]  So, I have a question. A couple years ago, you did a thing... This is pre-podcast. This is pre-content at all. You just did this to amuse yourself.
[48:20.650 --> 48:34.690]  You did a really fun, really clever, really cool thing that I was a big fan of, where you, for a solid month, you played, not Fortnite, but PUBG. You played PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
[48:35.190 --> 48:42.750]  And you only ate real food in real life if you won the game. And when you win the game, it's called winning a winner winner chicken dinner.
[48:43.090 --> 48:48.230]  And so you were only allowed to eat chicken, but you could only eat chicken when you won a round of PUBG.
[48:48.230 --> 48:55.870]  So if you played for 10 hours in a day and you didn't win a game, you didn't eat that day. Which I thought was brilliant and really fun to watch.
[48:55.910 --> 49:03.050]  And you actually ended the 30 days with a surplus of food, but... I would have starved to death. Yeah, yeah, no kidding, right?
[49:04.690 --> 49:12.150]  How, on the worst day, on your toughest day in that, how long do you think you played and streamed? Because you streamed that entire thing too.
[49:12.650 --> 49:20.890]  I did. Well, there were times where I would stream. Thank you. You just made me think of something else, Geoff. Unrelated to that.
[49:20.950 --> 49:29.170]  But if I didn't stream, I'd screenshot the win. I think the most I probably played, probably around eight hours, I'd say. Once again, it's the most I'd put in a day.
[49:29.510 --> 49:36.310]  So less than half of what you're going to have to do here. I'd assume so. Yeah, that was a constant. Maybe it was longer. I don't know.
[49:36.310 --> 49:43.530]  It's hard to tell with time between sleeping and whatnot. I would definitely stream for like four hours, three hours a night, I'd say.
[49:43.650 --> 49:49.970]  And then on weekends, I'd probably play a little bit during the day without streaming. Are there Donkey Kong 64 speedruns?
[49:50.150 --> 49:56.990]  I'm sure there are, but those would involve using like cheats and skips that I would not use. Yeah, it's a pretty glitchy game.
[49:56.990 --> 50:02.650]  Your goal is to play it legitimately and that's not how you're going to cheat. You'll find a different way to cheat.
[50:03.210 --> 50:09.670]  I'm not going to cheat. I didn't cheat the Halo bet. If anything, Gavit was more cheating the Halo bet. Then I had to copy his cheats.
[50:10.070 --> 50:14.430]  Not really cheat. You're using... what is cheating?
[50:15.730 --> 50:24.570]  If me using skulls... wait. Can I get the audio isolated of Andrew saying, I'm not going to cheat, followed up by, what is cheating?
[50:26.710 --> 50:27.670]  That'd be great. Thank you.
[50:29.770 --> 50:37.470]  You brought up a moment ago, Geoff, me streaming it and made me think of the fact, well, when I wasn't streaming, I would screenshot my wins.
[50:37.950 --> 50:48.250]  I think Gavin may have, and I don't know this to be true, but I think Gavin may have pulled off the greatest troll move against me anyone ever has.
[50:49.550 --> 50:57.650]  I think it's highly possible. And if you have, I want to applaud you, Gavin. It was a great move.
[50:57.870 --> 51:04.910]  As part of, as we discussed, this album structure of ideas, as last night, I was like, I need to think of more content.
[51:05.290 --> 51:12.150]  Whenever Gavin and I play Halo right now, he does a thing where we try to get more kills than each other.
[51:12.190 --> 51:16.770]  And I typically will have more than he does. But if there's a game where he has more kills than me,
[51:17.190 --> 51:23.050]  he'll call out that he's doing, that he is, and that he screenshots the screen whenever we play.
[51:23.550 --> 51:29.290]  This has gone on for weeks now. And he'll say it, and he'll typically wait until, he won't bring attention to it,
[51:29.330 --> 51:34.850]  until there's maybe like nine or ten kills left in a game. And then he'll be like, ah, screenshot game.
[51:35.150 --> 51:39.450]  And then it will become intense, and I will try to win. And I most of the time don't.
[51:39.550 --> 51:44.170]  And it ends with me disappointedly yelling, we've had some close screenshot games where I've almost come back.
[51:44.170 --> 51:48.990]  Well, cause Andrew, we mostly just play very casually. We're not playing ranked half the time.
[51:49.070 --> 51:53.150]  We're just playing like Fiesta or something very casual. So we're just like shooting the shit half the game.
[51:53.190 --> 51:59.330]  And if I notice towards the end that I'm doing better, I'll mention it. And then Andrew just goes basically silent
[51:59.330 --> 52:00.810]  as he tries to concentrate.
[52:01.550 --> 52:06.670]  It becomes very competitive. And then I've had this joke where I'm gonna buy Gavin a photo album,
[52:06.670 --> 52:12.930]  and when he has enough screenshots to fill the photo album, there'll be like a prize or something as a gag.
[52:12.930 --> 52:18.850]  So last night, I decided, I was like, well, I wonder, we've been playing for quite a few weeks now,
[52:18.910 --> 52:23.130]  there have been plenty of screenshot games. How many screenshots has Gavin taken?
[52:23.750 --> 52:29.510]  And so I checked your thing, and there was not a single screenshot there.
[52:29.710 --> 52:35.130]  And I had never considered the possibility that you just say screenshot without screenshotting.
[52:35.370 --> 52:39.930]  Gavin, have you taken a single screenshot during our screenshot game?
[52:40.630 --> 52:41.650]  I took one.
[52:41.650 --> 52:43.090]  You took one?
[52:46.270 --> 52:47.190]  That's great.
[52:48.890 --> 52:50.050]  That's a fantastic troll move.
[52:51.750 --> 52:56.470]  The sweatiness of these games whenever Gavin would throw out a screenshot game.
[52:56.730 --> 52:59.450]  I don't know how quickly you figured out that I wasn't taking them.
[52:59.830 --> 53:01.610]  Oh, I was gonna do that for so long.
[53:01.870 --> 53:05.770]  Well, here's the thing. You could have had an out, and I'm glad I didn't set it up this way.
[53:05.910 --> 53:09.390]  That information is private on your account. I can't see it.
[53:09.390 --> 53:17.710]  So I wasn't sure if you had flipped it to private prior to the screenshot thing, and that's why they weren't there.
[53:17.830 --> 53:20.870]  So there was room for you to continue this.
[53:21.410 --> 53:27.890]  No, the only one I took was the one I sent you, where I guess I'd only half held down the back button, or I'd let go too soon.
[53:27.990 --> 53:32.270]  But it's like a very transparent version of the scoreboard. Like, I messed up the screenshot.
[53:32.610 --> 53:37.090]  It's funny, because I think I've taken one screenshot myself, and I couldn't figure out how you did it,
[53:37.090 --> 53:41.230]  because it looked shitty. Like, there's not a post-game screen.
[53:42.010 --> 53:45.250]  But I had never thought... and then last... it was like the scene in the usual...
[53:45.250 --> 53:48.470]  where they're slowly dropping the coffee cup when he has the realization.
[53:48.690 --> 53:50.090]  I was like, I wonder how many screenshots...
[53:51.050 --> 53:51.850]  Oh, no!
[53:53.570 --> 53:54.910]  Is this all a lie?
[53:57.490 --> 53:59.230]  Yeah, I just didn't want to clog up my feed.
[54:02.570 --> 54:04.210]  Clog up the feed nobody can see.
[54:05.770 --> 54:07.790]  Well, I could have to scroll through it one day, aren't I?
[54:08.310 --> 54:14.670]  You know what? I started today, Gavin, feeling bad that Geoff is fucking with you, with you always being in a bad mood.
[54:14.950 --> 54:15.970]  I no longer feel bad.
[54:17.110 --> 54:19.210]  Geoff has this bad mood, you have your screenshot.
[54:19.770 --> 54:24.490]  He is in a bad mood sometimes, though. I only... like, sometimes he's not, but sometimes he's...
[54:24.490 --> 54:28.310]  it's pretty noticeable, and you're like... maybe just because I know him so well, but it's like, goddamn, dude.
[54:28.930 --> 54:31.450]  What the... do you think people don't get in a bad mood?
[54:31.450 --> 54:33.270]  Yeah, but the ratio with you...
[54:33.270 --> 54:35.530]  Everyone has, like, a gammy day where they didn't sleep well.
[54:35.910 --> 54:39.370]  It's comedy, you know, but all comedy has a grain of truth in it, right?
[54:39.510 --> 54:43.150]  And the reality is that more often than not, you're in a gammy mood.
[54:43.850 --> 54:47.490]  Get a new... we need to get you a new bed, and a new door...
[54:47.490 --> 54:53.830]  No, I'm trying to do all these... I'm trying to make myself sleep better, I'm trying to lock people out, I'm trying to, you know, fingerprint the door handles and all that.
[54:54.270 --> 54:56.710]  I'm trying to make myself less tired.
[54:56.710 --> 55:02.310]  But I would say, like, 95% of the time, I'm solid.
[55:04.110 --> 55:07.750]  Well, I think everybody else might come up with a different ratio, but it's cool that you think that.
[55:08.130 --> 55:09.910]  What about you, Andrew? Do you think I'm in a bad mood sometimes?
[55:10.250 --> 55:13.930]  No! Only once. There's only one time where it felt genuine.
[55:14.550 --> 55:17.730]  I don't know, that no wasn't super believable there.
[55:18.450 --> 55:18.910]  You went...
[55:18.910 --> 55:19.230]  No!
[55:19.650 --> 55:24.330]  We can't do that, we're gonna take away the entire English language from Geoff if we start calling out every word.
[55:24.330 --> 55:25.490]  He's already lost... oh.
[55:26.070 --> 55:27.850]  We can't also remove...
[55:27.850 --> 55:33.250]  Honestly, if I feel like I'm genuinely in a bit of a flat mood, I just try and avoid people in general.
[55:34.030 --> 55:35.330]  Is that why I never talk to you?
[55:39.230 --> 55:43.650]  No, that tracks, that makes a lot of sense, that's why we never communicate.
[55:44.290 --> 55:49.250]  If I'm feeling really tired and a bunch of people hanging out, I would much prefer not to go.
[55:49.330 --> 55:53.270]  I just don't like being around people when I'm tired, because I just feel like I'm not being very funny, or I'm just being boring.
[55:55.150 --> 55:59.470]  Everyone's gonna be in a better place if I'm just gonna go to sleep early or something.
[55:59.530 --> 56:01.650]  Yeah, the world would be a much better place without you.
[56:04.890 --> 56:08.150]  Wait, Andrew, what was the one time I was in a bad mood?
[56:09.190 --> 56:13.450]  I don't remember the context of it, but Geoff said it, I think, to fuck with you.
[56:13.830 --> 56:17.190]  I think it was the third time he had done it, but it seemed genuine.
[56:17.190 --> 56:20.550]  And that's what made it funny.
[56:20.710 --> 56:27.850]  It is funny that he fucks with you, and that you don't know how to react to it, but when you're actually in a bad mood, it makes it way funnier.
[56:29.550 --> 56:35.110]  The problem is, the problem for you, Gavin, is that sometimes I'm kidding.
[56:35.970 --> 56:36.250]  Sometimes.
[56:39.290 --> 56:40.950]  That's all. Sometimes I'm not.
[56:40.950 --> 56:51.790]  Sometimes you are legitimately, and maybe it's because we lived together for so long, and maybe I just know you that well, but sometimes I'm definitely not kidding.
[56:52.230 --> 56:54.870]  And I guess you'll just never know.
[56:55.570 --> 57:01.050]  I feel like you're maybe attributing just generic tiredness to actually being in a bad mood.
[57:01.210 --> 57:03.270]  A lot of the time I am a little bit lethargic.
[57:03.650 --> 57:07.450]  I know tired, lethargic Gavin. We made Red vs. Blue together, I remember those long days.
[57:07.890 --> 57:10.450]  I know, I've seen you fall asleep standing up, you're so tired.
[57:11.750 --> 57:12.350]  That's true.
[57:15.110 --> 57:18.570]  So here's my idea for the Infinity Pie.
[57:19.170 --> 57:19.330]  Okay.
[57:19.790 --> 57:21.250]  Alright, I just realized I never got to it.
[57:21.610 --> 57:24.170]  Yeah, it took me a moment, but I know what you're talking about.
[57:24.190 --> 57:25.050]  I'm crowbarring into it.
[57:25.330 --> 57:29.790]  So I had the idea, or I think actually maybe you had the idea, Andrew, I don't want to steal it.
[57:30.810 --> 57:35.690]  An idea was formed at some point in the past through some combination of this podcast.
[57:35.750 --> 57:36.590]  Just say the idea.
[57:36.590 --> 57:39.390]  Where we wanted to make the Infinity Towel, right?
[57:39.450 --> 57:49.370]  We wanted to take all the little pieces of relics of NBA players and make a super towel that's got LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and Jason Tatum and Joel Embiid in it.
[57:49.810 --> 57:51.930]  You said that'd be a funny visual.
[57:52.530 --> 57:55.270]  And just to be clear, not actual full team towel.
[57:55.270 --> 57:57.370]  We've asked people to send in towel cards.
[57:57.730 --> 57:59.050]  Just to be clear, they're towel cards.
[57:59.350 --> 58:00.290]  It's just a little snippet of it.
[58:01.550 --> 58:03.210]  And by the way, people have been sending stuff in.
[58:03.210 --> 58:07.810]  I went and checked the mail yesterday, or today, and I had a bunch of baseball cards that people have sent in.
[58:07.930 --> 58:10.690]  Not baseball cards, but different kinds of wild trading cards.
[58:11.130 --> 58:12.770]  So we'll try to open those up on a break show.
[58:12.970 --> 58:14.230]  That already happened at this point.
[58:15.870 --> 58:17.870]  So if you watched that, you saw the cards.
[58:18.070 --> 58:18.610]  You know what they are.
[58:18.870 --> 58:21.310]  Anyway, I was thinking the other night, I was ordering pizza.
[58:22.090 --> 58:26.950]  And I had this problem in my house where I like Hawaiian pizza.
[58:27.150 --> 58:30.630]  I like a Hawaiian pie and I like a fiery Hawaiian pizza.
[58:31.170 --> 58:33.590]  But I don't like it an entire pizza worth.
[58:33.850 --> 58:35.710]  And my girlfriend and my daughter are not big fans.
[58:36.130 --> 58:40.510]  So I don't ever want to order a whole Hawaiian pie for myself.
[58:40.690 --> 58:43.390]  Because I generally just want one piece.
[58:43.810 --> 58:46.750]  And then they want to get a margarita or a pepperoni or whatever.
[58:47.050 --> 58:48.250]  And then I thought about it.
[58:48.730 --> 58:54.870]  They should make a pizza called the infinity pie where it's eight slices and each slice is a different pizza.
[58:54.870 --> 59:01.450]  So you get a taste of all the different kinds of pizzas at once without having to order too much pizza.
[59:01.610 --> 59:07.170]  Or just, in my case, go without ever having a Hawaiian pizza because I would be left with six slices I wouldn't eat.
[59:07.530 --> 59:08.650]  An infinity pie.
[59:08.950 --> 59:13.930]  I think that would do so well if Pizza Hut or Domino's or one of those chains created it.
[59:13.970 --> 59:15.190]  And it's like, here's your pepperoni slice.
[59:15.470 --> 59:16.410]  Here's your Hawaiian slice.
[59:16.530 --> 59:17.710]  Here's your veggie slice.
[59:18.010 --> 59:19.170]  Here's your gluten-free slice.
[59:19.390 --> 59:21.770]  Here's your meat extravaganza slice.
[59:22.130 --> 59:23.710]  Here's your double pep or whatever.
[59:23.710 --> 59:27.690]  You always end up with a pizza box with just one slice of anchovy left in it.
[59:28.130 --> 59:29.470]  Well, yeah. I mean, maybe.
[59:30.050 --> 59:33.770]  Or maybe people would be like, well, there's only one left. I'm going to learn to like anchovies.
[59:33.910 --> 59:34.850]  And then they... oh.
[59:35.510 --> 59:36.610]  Little Caesars makes this.
[59:37.010 --> 59:38.070]  Little Caesars makes this!
[59:38.330 --> 59:39.490]  It's called the Quattro Pizza.
[59:40.190 --> 59:40.530]  Wow.
[59:40.610 --> 59:41.470]  It's called the... what is it called?
[59:41.830 --> 59:43.330]  It's called a Quattro, I believe.
[59:43.850 --> 59:44.130]  Alright.
[59:44.430 --> 59:45.070]  I've never had it.
[59:45.210 --> 59:47.750]  I don't see a Hawaiian pizza on that.
[59:48.030 --> 59:50.630]  It's not in their four. No, I don't know if you pick.
[59:51.170 --> 59:51.670]  It's a great question.
[59:51.670 --> 59:52.290]  Can you pick the four?
[59:52.290 --> 59:54.710]  Eric is saying that it was like the first episode of...
[59:55.170 --> 59:56.990]  No, you don't pick the four. It's just four.
[59:56.990 --> 59:59.290]  Yeah, see, that's the problem. I would want to be able to pick.
[59:59.350 --> 01:00:02.250]  And four is not enough. I would want to... that's not infinity to me. That's quadruple.
[01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.090]  I don't... hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:05.090]  Yeah, infinity is eight.
[01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:05.810]  Four...
[01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.290]  Infinity is eight.
[01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:11.710]  You want a pizza where every single slice is different?
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.470]  I think so, yes. But it's still one pizza.
[01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:17.370]  No, I understand that it's what... yeah, no, I get that.
[01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:20.650]  I'm saying that... but you want every single slice to be different.
[01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.470]  I think so, yes.
[01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:25.470]  You want one slice, one individual... that seems... that seems...
[01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:27.310]  Well, Eric, an eight tipped over is infinity.
[01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:28.490]  Yeah, see?
[01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:36.690]  Like, turn an eight sideways, kick, kick, kick, kick it, kick an eight as if it's a small Canadian kid, and it becomes an infinity.
[01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:38.850]  Let's just throw out a scenario.
[01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.090]  Very quickly. It becomes a crying infinity sign.
[01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:44.190]  Let's throw out a scenario, Geoff. You... we're at your place.
[01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:48.190]  There's a group of people. Gavin's there. A bunch of people are there.
[01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:52.130]  And you let it known to the party that you have ordered your infinity pizza?
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:53.390]  Mm-hmm.
[01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:57.350]  I am rushing to that fucking box like it's the beginning of the Hunger Games.
[01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:02.870]  If there's only one slice of each type, I need... like, it's gonna be fucking chaos.
[01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:09.190]  It's just gonna be a... it'll be like the XFL where they just put the ball in the middle of the field, and everybody ran to it for the kickoff.
[01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.990]  Everyone's gonna be storming that pizza box.
[01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:15.610]  And if somebody was a storm chaser, I will get there first.
[01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:20.010]  What you're saying is it's creating enthusiasm around the food. I like it.
[01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:27.230]  No. No, it's... you're creating false scarcity, so I'm gonna have to fucking elbow two people I like to make sure I get pepperoni.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:31.330]  You just imagine a big party full of shitloads of people, and then someone's like,
[01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:34.390]  I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna get eight infinity pizzas.
[01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.730]  Yeah, that's eight slices for it.
[01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.130]  Oh, maybe we should have just got eight normal pizzas.
[01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:42.650]  I disagree.
[01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:48.970]  Never... never describe scarcity as creating enthusiasm ever again, Flace. It is a terrible...
[01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:56.450]  No, no, it's creating enthusiasm. I wanna say you get a slice of cheese, you get a slice of pep, you get a slice of mushroom and pep, you get a slice of veg, you get a slice of wine.
[01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.770]  That's exciting if I'm the only one eating the pizza.
[01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:05.650]  How often are you having parties? How often are you partying? How many times... how... let me ask you a question.
[01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:13.490]  How... on a scale of, like, how many out of every ten times you order a pizza, is it for a party or is it for you or you and, like, one other person?
[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:19.110]  Because for me it's ten out of ten times I'm getting a pizza for me, my girlfriend, and my daughter. Not the whole fucking world.
[01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:20.850]  Depends how much pizza I'm ordering.
[01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:29.090]  I mean, I would assume the rules... anytime you're ordering for... in mass, the rules of ordering change.
[01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:36.610]  I also wouldn't ever order, like, a tray of a hundred nuggets, uh, for myself, but if I'm having people over, maybe I'll do that.
[01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:41.690]  So what's... what's the maximum capacity for the quad pizza, or the infinity pizza, in your mind?
[01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:42.410]  Eight.
[01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:45.650]  No, that's way too many people! How many slices...
[01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:47.510]  Oh, eight people, I'm sorry, how many slices... how many people?
[01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:48.350]  Yes.
[01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:51.110]  Oh, uh, I would say four...
[01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.670]  If I could go to a pizza party and get one slice of pizza, I'm fucking mad.
[01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.750]  I would say four. Everybody gets two. Everybody gets two slices.
[01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:58.450]  Two slices is not enough.
[01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.430]  No, that's... you need a... I... no.
[01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.350]  I'm not gonna eat more than two pieces of pizza.
[01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:09.930]  Then I'm okay if you... I would say three, and if you're part of the three and you're only eating two, then I'm okay with it.
[01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:14.870]  Then three. But I'm okay with every... Eric says it's not the slices, it's the choices. I'm okay with every choice on the pie.
[01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:18.370]  Well, then... what are all the choices?
[01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:34.770]  I mean, let's see. Cheese, pepperoni, mushroom pep, veg, Hawaiian, uh, deluxe, meat lovers, and margarita.
[01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.650]  Hmm.
[01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:42.750]  It adds a little bit of variety, because you're like, ooh, what am I gonna get? What's left in the box? What am I gonna have?
[01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:45.790]  You don't actually know. You know it's gonna be something you like, but you don't know which one.
[01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:51.470]  I would say it enhances... I'm about to say it enhances that slice. Makes it taste even better.
[01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:54.650]  So you're gonna keep a tomato base across the entire pizza?
[01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:59.750]  Uh, for this infinity pie, yeah. I'm sure... I'm assuming that there's other options.
[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:04.910]  What if... what if I told you that, uh, one of the slices has the P word on it?
[01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:08.650]  You're creating a scenario in which every slice is something that you like.
[01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:11.590]  And a scenario in which you don't like every slice.
[01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:18.690]  I would say that, uh... I would say, first off, that's ludicrous. How often have you seen a pizza with the P word on it?
[01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:23.570]  But I would also say I just described probably the eight most common slices of pizza out there.
[01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:29.790]  I don't think I'm stretching or going for weird ingredients. I'm just going for, like, the pizzas that you mostly see out in the world, in the wild.
[01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:38.290]  That's fair. I just don't... as somebody... as somebody who doesn't love every slice of pizza, I'm pretty... I'm pretty cornered.
[01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:41.830]  So which... which out of those eight that I said, which one wouldn't you eat?
[01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:46.950]  I... I'm not a big fan of sausage on pizza. Don't like it.
[01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:49.290]  I wouldn't touch an olive.
[01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.570]  Yeah, olive... if you... there's an olive on there, I'm out.
[01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.230]  Sometimes... oh, no, I can enjoy a red onion on a pizza.
[01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:04.170]  I mainly stick within the camps of, like, I'm either going to have a barbecue chicken pizza or, like, a pepperoni pizza. Those are my two mates.
[01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:16.450]  See, I feel like barbecue chicken would be a bridge too far in my infinity pie. I think that's a little bit more of a niche slice of pizza, but I do enjoy a barbecue chicken pizza for sure.
[01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:20.270]  I like a Hawaiian, but I swap out the ham with pepperoni.
[01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:21.310]  Hmm.
[01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:28.890]  So if I could poach some of your pineapple from your Hawaiian slice, I still... I think this is a terrible idea.
[01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:30.710]  Terrible idea.
[01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:32.190]  Terrible. I would say terrible.
[01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:32.670]  Terrible.
[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.270]  I'd go as far as saying terrible.
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:40.430]  Yeah. Unless I'm ordering for myself and I can pick all the slices, in which case I'm probably just doing a half and half.
[01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:44.490]  Yeah, I guess. I think it would revolutionize pizza.
[01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:48.150]  I think that Little Caesars was on to something, they just didn't take it far enough.
[01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:57.990]  I think it would be... you have me back on board if it's all the crust varieties, all the topping varieties, all the sauce varieties, and you don't know what you're buying.
[01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:09.750]  And it's like the different brands, like, you know how like Domino's, their flat crust is like a fucking cracker, each like how they cut it.
[01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:11.230]  Like if there's one tiny...
[01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.770]  That's more of a Franken-pizza.
[01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:17.370]  You're describing what's called the infinite mystery pizza. I love that too.
[01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:25.310]  I'm in for that. That sounds great. But just one slice of everything, they're all the same outside of just topping variety.
[01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:27.170]  That's a tougher sell for me.
[01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:30.990]  What about that bread clip, right?
[01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:40.950]  Yeah, what about that bread clip? I wouldn't buy just pizza, but I would buy a glorious tiki mug that looked like a port-a-potty that came out a week ago.
[01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:54.170]  If you go to our website, to our store, store.roosterteeth.com, and then you look up in the f***face section, and you see a pink port-a-potty tiki mug, and it's still for sale, we have a problem.
[01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:56.690]  Please. Please buy it.
[01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.770]  Please. Please, for God's sakes.
[01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.950]  Would that be our second flop after the skateboard?
[01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:08.270]  After the skateboard, they're never gonna let us make anything again. If we fail on these tiki mugs.
[01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:14.610]  We should just maintain a page on the store called the f***face flops, and just put everything on the site.
[01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:16.910]  Acknowledge that it's a piece of s***.
[01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:17.890]  Flopface.
[01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.270]  Flopface!
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:30.150]  Speaking of flops, one of the things... I know we gotta end the show. I know Eric's yelling at me.
[01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:39.710]  We had a conversation the other night, we were all playing video games together, and I was asking you guys what your favorite candy or sweet was, and then you guys gave me your answers, and so I bought them.
[01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:46.730]  And I meant to tell you guys to do the same thing, and then I thought we could all try each other's favorite candies on air, and have like a little candy taste test.
[01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:54.470]  But in the process of buying some, and I'm still waiting for Andrew's to show up, I discovered...
[01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:59.050]  I don't know if you know, I'm a huge Laffy Taffy fan. I'm a big banana Laffy Taffy fan.
[01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:07.530]  And I was at the store buying some candy, some of this candy last night, and I saw that there's this thing called Laffy Taffy Candy Laff Bites.
[01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.550]  And it's all banana. It's called Gone Bananas.
[01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:15.630]  And it's just like... I don't know, it's like a different kind of candy, but it's Laffy Taffy brand.
[01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:23.690]  And so I got the idea that it was basically like, if you're one of those people who loves banana runs like I do, you just want banana runs, and if you can just buy banana runs, you do.
[01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:28.270]  So I bought this thinking that I was going to get some fucking, just a bunch of yummy-ass banana Laffy Taffy.
[01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:32.390]  This sucks. This was such a misstep for the Laffy Taffy brand.
[01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:35.590]  It is so unfun to eat, and it's so bland.
[01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:43.650]  I can't believe they have yellow banana gold in their grasp, and they turned it into this.
[01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:47.230]  I just... just so disappointed. That's all.
[01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.770]  Just had to register my frustration.
[01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:50.750]  So what is it called, sorry?
[01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:54.010]  Laffy Taffy Candy Laff Bites. Gone Bananas.
[01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:56.690]  Okay. I will see if I can find it, because I don't...
[01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:58.370]  I'd be disappointed.
[01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:03.370]  But I don't like base Laffy Taffy, so maybe this will be... maybe I'll enjoy this more.
[01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:05.170]  Base Laffy Taffy is good.
[01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.730]  So are we doing the candy thing next time?
[01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:11.290]  I think we should. Do you guys know what your favorite candy... do you know what candies to buy?
[01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:11.970]  Yeah.
[01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:12.710]  What do I buy?
[01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:20.110]  Well, mine is Mini Starburst, but only the Fave Reds version.
[01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:25.070]  Mini Starburst, Fave Reds. I don't want the regular Mini Starburst, because it has the orange and the yellow.
[01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:26.650]  They taste like dog shit. You don't want that.
[01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.950]  But Fave Reds, you just get the red and the pink. Starburst, yeah.
[01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.570]  And then also Chewy Nerds.
[01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:35.690]  Andrew, I believe yours was Sour Chewy Nerds.
[01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:36.570]  Sour Chewy Nerds.
[01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.170]  Which I had to buy online, and they haven't arrived yet.
[01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:40.450]  I can't get them locally.
[01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:43.650]  And then Gavin, you said Kinder Bueno. I have one of those as well.
[01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:45.450]  Yeah, a little treat.
[01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:47.470]  So if you...
[01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:59.490]  Okay, but Gavin, imagine a Kinder Bueno, but one part of it was a Kit Kat, and the next part of it was an arrow, and it ended as, I don't know, a Reese's Pieces cup.
[01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:00.450]  How do you feel about that?
[01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:01.690]  I'd give it a go.
[01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:04.050]  Yeah? That actually sounds pretty good.
[01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.150]  The Infinity Chocolate.
[01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:08.650]  I just had a genius idea. What if we call it the Infinity Chocolate?
[01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.630]  It's just like an 8, but knocked over.
[01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.510]  That could be our brand. That's what it says on the wrapper.
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.270]  Infinity Chocolate.
[01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:19.810]  1 in 10,000 bars says a bread clip.
[01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:26.190]  Should we stop the podcast?
[01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:28.590]  Yeah, we should stop the show. Yes, we should stop the show.
[01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:29.570]  I was waiting for somebody to end it.
[01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:31.350]  What do you mean? It's been over.
[01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:32.850]  Someone flop us an outro.
[01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.570]  Alright, you got it, guys. Hey, thank you so much for listening.
[01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:43.090]  This is episode number 89. Next episode, episode 90, a revolutionary episode in F*** Face history where everyone eats candy.
[01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:46.810]  Thank you so much for listening. Buy a Tiki mug. Store.roosterteeth.com.
[01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.210]  And we'll see you next time on F*** Face.
[01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:51.070]  Not an official ending, but I'll allow it.
[01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:55.650]  Hey, guys. Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:57.530]  Geoff wants to sell knives.
[01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:00.230]  Gavin and Andrew have an interesting conversation.
[01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:02.770]  Panton is a David Hasselhoff guy.
[01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.550]  Geoff gets a candy gift.
[01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:06.890]  How many train movies are there?
[01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:08.850]  What creature poops nerds?
[01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.710]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:14.870]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
