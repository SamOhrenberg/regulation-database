[00:00.000 --> 00:02.920]  Was one of your resolutions this year to order less takeout?

[00:30.330 --> 00:37.290]  Hello and welcome to the spanky dandy old men can't say bro, let's not argue about the
[00:37.290 --> 00:42.390]  moon landing podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey. Welcome to you, the audience. Your name is
[00:42.390 --> 00:46.890]  whatever the fuck it is. Also with me, Andrew and Gavin. This is episode 91.
[00:47.230 --> 00:48.870]  That came through my speakers for some reason.
[00:49.070 --> 00:49.410]  Did it.
[00:49.470 --> 00:50.610]  How else do you get it?
[00:50.930 --> 00:52.990]  Spanky Danky is his name.
[00:53.230 --> 00:54.210]  Spanky Danky.
[00:54.230 --> 00:57.110]  So I was directionally correct. I was close. Spanky Danky.
[00:57.270 --> 01:01.830]  What you get there, audience, in that intro and also Gavin, because of course he wasn't here,
[01:02.130 --> 01:07.250]  that is a recap of this episode's pleasantries. Couldn't bring you along for the pleasantries,
[01:07.490 --> 01:11.690]  but wanted to give you a little nugget of what it was because it was a wild ride for the seven
[01:11.690 --> 01:14.350]  minutes I was involved and it had already been going for a bit.
[01:14.630 --> 01:17.910]  So when did the pleasantries start with Andrew? Like 20 minutes ago?
[01:18.230 --> 01:23.230]  No. Well, listen, I showed up 15 minutes ago. Everybody else showed up 10 minutes, I'd say.
[01:23.490 --> 01:29.170]  I showed up maybe... they were going. When I clicked in, there was a laughter and Nick was
[01:29.170 --> 01:30.350]  like, this is already off the rails.
[01:30.770 --> 01:35.550]  And based on last week's pleasantries, I decided not to attend this week's pleasantries
[01:36.150 --> 01:37.850]  on the grounds that they're worthless.
[01:37.850 --> 01:42.230]  You missed a lot. We heard about two old men who tried to one-up each other in a Walmart
[01:42.230 --> 01:46.050]  about whether they were both directly involved with either the moon landing
[01:46.050 --> 01:52.290]  or the covering up of the moon landing. We learned about Spanky Dandy, the hottest new rapper.
[01:53.390 --> 01:54.710]  What about this, Gavin?
[01:55.050 --> 02:01.250]  Next week, next time we record, whatever that is, I will not show up until one and you can
[02:01.250 --> 02:04.310]  show up 10 minutes early and you can have the pleasantries experience.
[02:04.610 --> 02:07.470]  Why don't we just all turn up at the same time and record it all?
[02:07.850 --> 02:09.930]  For the audience to listen to all of.
[02:10.130 --> 02:12.550]  Because the pleasantries are a great part that I hate the most.
[02:12.970 --> 02:18.590]  Gavin, you came up in the pleasantries. We regaled your Bob Vila Go-Gurt experience.
[02:18.770 --> 02:19.170]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19.310 --> 02:21.850]  We talked about that a bit. We discovered that the Venn diagram
[02:21.850 --> 02:26.350]  of people who make a Logan's Run reference and say bro is me.
[02:31.810 --> 02:34.270]  It was a jam-packed seven minutes.
[02:34.270 --> 02:37.050]  I'll be honest, this week's pleasantries sounded better than last week's.
[02:37.050 --> 02:40.870]  Well, I think the problem is when you get here, we just end up starting the show.
[02:40.950 --> 02:43.290]  So there are no pleasantries. It just immediately goes in.
[02:43.390 --> 02:44.210]  So that's why it's offering.
[02:44.430 --> 02:48.610]  So what you're saying is it's physically impossible for me to attend pleasantries
[02:48.610 --> 02:49.970]  if I'm the last to join.
[02:50.110 --> 02:54.170]  I think the last person who joins, whoever that is, doesn't get to partake in the pleasantries.
[02:54.510 --> 02:56.010]  All right. So next week you're out.
[02:56.310 --> 03:01.770]  So I'm out. I'm willing to step out for pleasantries and I welcome you to get in 10 minutes early.
[03:02.030 --> 03:04.950]  I agree with Nick. There was less pressure on these pleasantries this week.
[03:04.950 --> 03:06.810]  Last week, there was a lot of pleasantry pressure.
[03:07.070 --> 03:09.970]  That's a good point. I think you just need to naturally show.
[03:10.310 --> 03:11.370]  My power might go off.
[03:11.630 --> 03:14.770]  Yeah, you having a rough day, huh, buddy?
[03:15.030 --> 03:18.730]  Yeah, got booted from a GTA video I was in earlier because my power went off.
[03:18.950 --> 03:20.330]  And it could happen again today.
[03:20.630 --> 03:22.650]  Well, it's still today. I mean, now.
[03:22.970 --> 03:27.590]  We're in the midst of another snowstorm in Austin, so the entire state has shut down.
[03:28.110 --> 03:29.250]  Things are fine at my house, though.
[03:29.370 --> 03:30.410]  A bit warmer this year, though.
[03:30.630 --> 03:34.030]  Yeah, well, last time was a historic cold, right?
[03:34.030 --> 03:39.670]  Yeah, it's only minus 3 today, which is definitely enough to grind the whole of Texas to a halt.
[03:40.050 --> 03:42.730]  But last year, it was like minus 16 or something.
[03:43.070 --> 03:45.410]  Yeah, it's pretty sucky. It's going to continue to get colder, though.
[03:45.430 --> 03:46.850]  It's going to be even colder tomorrow, I hear.
[03:47.870 --> 03:50.470]  Nick said, is this Gavin's Print the Law episode?
[03:51.110 --> 03:53.030]  Too soon to tell, but quite possibly.
[03:53.410 --> 03:53.890]  Quite possibly.
[03:54.330 --> 03:55.610]  Do you have a generator, Gavin?
[03:55.930 --> 03:56.830]  I've got batteries.
[03:57.210 --> 03:59.030]  Well, what does that mean? What is batteries?
[03:59.550 --> 04:01.770]  I got fucking batteries. I don't know what that means.
[04:01.930 --> 04:02.270]  What do you mean?
[04:03.570 --> 04:06.870]  Your batteries explode. Geoff has batteries.
[04:07.450 --> 04:12.630]  Yeah, I'm not talking about just AA. I've got, like, large block, like, camping batteries.
[04:12.990 --> 04:17.330]  His garage is full of AC Delco car batteries, just in case.
[04:19.250 --> 04:22.570]  I got all these double... I got a million fucking double as I'm ready.
[04:22.830 --> 04:27.610]  It's like having a generator, but it doesn't last as long, but I don't have to put petrol in it.
[04:27.770 --> 04:30.850]  That's fair. What do you... Okay, so let's say you lose power,
[04:30.850 --> 04:34.890]  and you gotta use... What's the first item that's getting hooked up? Is it the fridge?
[04:35.510 --> 04:38.330]  What are you protecting? The internet. That's number one for you.
[04:38.390 --> 04:40.850]  How many of the batteries do you have? What are we working with here?
[04:41.090 --> 04:41.310]  Eight.
[04:41.630 --> 04:43.590]  Eight? Okay, that's pretty good. I don't...
[04:43.590 --> 04:47.510]  I use them for, like, filming in the quarry, typically, but it comes in handy when all the
[04:47.510 --> 04:50.970]  power's off. Well, I mean, I just turn on the inter... We, like, ration the internet, mainly,
[04:51.070 --> 04:54.710]  because it's nice to, you know, hear updates about the world and...
[04:54.710 --> 04:55.030]  Yes.
[04:55.250 --> 04:59.250]  Maybe quickly grab some content to watch with dinner.
[04:59.250 --> 05:01.750]  For your crippling porn addiction, right?
[05:02.110 --> 05:09.590]  Uh, yeah. I can't imagine, like, pre-downloading porn. What is it, like, the 2000s?
[05:11.150 --> 05:16.930]  That would be really extreme. Not like, I need to pleasure myself now,
[05:17.010 --> 05:19.850]  but I'm gonna do it later. Imagine scheduling that.
[05:22.630 --> 05:25.350]  I'm not horny now, but I'll get it down.
[05:25.350 --> 05:29.490]  Just in case of horny, break glass.
[05:31.970 --> 05:36.530]  I did not think that throwaway joke was gonna result in so much funny.
[05:36.910 --> 05:37.610]  That's awesome, Gavin.
[05:37.850 --> 05:41.850]  I don't remember if we talked about it in a recording or if it was outside of the fact,
[05:41.910 --> 05:46.730]  but Gavin shared his battery holder thing at some point, where it's like, oh, yeah,
[05:46.930 --> 05:52.150]  I'm just imagining that for, like, porn hard drives, like, categorize. He's got different things.
[05:52.150 --> 05:57.630]  I love the idea of just putting on a little USB stick a few porn videos that you've never
[05:57.630 --> 06:02.850]  seen before that you know that you need offline. In case your raid goes down.
[06:04.850 --> 06:07.950]  I like the idea of you having to pick between, like, porn or your fridge,
[06:08.030 --> 06:09.610]  like you've got one more battery.
[06:10.410 --> 06:13.330]  I think I'm gonna do that. I think I'm gonna cut a little hole in my
[06:13.330 --> 06:16.590]  wall and put in, like, an emergency porn glass.
[06:17.090 --> 06:21.070]  Well, wait, what if you get one of those fridges that have, like, a screen in the front? You can
[06:21.070 --> 06:24.550]  be a double threat. You could just throw your porn to the front of the fridge.
[06:24.790 --> 06:27.670]  Wanking while you're facing your fridge is a bit weird in the middle of the...
[06:27.670 --> 06:32.670]  Well, I think having a fucking porn stash in case that a storm takes out your powers.
[06:32.930 --> 06:35.890]  We've gone beyond the realm of, like, normalcy.
[06:35.990 --> 06:39.370]  I mean, that's just an area where the digital world has kind of screwed us because, you know,
[06:39.410 --> 06:43.150]  back in the day, people would resort to magazines, which are available offline.
[06:43.470 --> 06:43.770]  Yeah.
[06:44.030 --> 06:44.290]  Yeah.
[06:44.370 --> 06:44.870]  Or VHS.
[06:45.230 --> 06:49.390]  Can I can I get a porn mag at a store? Like, I don't think... does Playboy stop publishing,
[06:49.530 --> 06:50.850]  right? They don't make magazines anymore.
[06:50.850 --> 06:53.610]  I think that they started again, maybe.
[06:53.850 --> 06:56.810]  But there are other porn companies that still make magazines, I believe.
[06:56.990 --> 06:59.330]  It's such an interesting line of thought of being like,
[06:59.410 --> 07:01.630]  I'm horny. I got to go to the 7-Eleven.
[07:02.970 --> 07:06.450]  Imagine if you were like, I want to I want to I don't want to look at a picture of people,
[07:06.550 --> 07:08.310]  fuck, but I would like to watch a video of it.
[07:08.590 --> 07:13.450]  You'd had to go to the other side of town to a disgusting dark building and then
[07:13.450 --> 07:17.890]  stare at the ground for 20 minutes while you try to find your flavor of porn in a porn theater.
[07:18.630 --> 07:21.650]  Knowing in the back there were dudes beaten off in little cubicles.
[07:21.970 --> 07:24.710]  The world has changed for the better rapidly.
[07:24.950 --> 07:28.190]  I don't understand those theaters, though. Like, people would go in and not wank.
[07:28.310 --> 07:29.050]  Is that the point of them?
[07:29.330 --> 07:29.750]  What do you mean?
[07:30.010 --> 07:33.110]  Like, it was always a big deal when people got caught monkeying off in a...
[07:33.110 --> 07:34.310]  You're talking like Pee Wee Herman?
[07:34.650 --> 07:34.890]  Yeah.
[07:34.990 --> 07:35.670]  Is that what we're talking about?
[07:35.730 --> 07:36.950]  I don't want to name names, but yeah.
[07:37.090 --> 07:38.850]  He was in a movie theater.
[07:39.410 --> 07:43.630]  And I also think that that turned out to be sort of... he sort of got fucked over by that.
[07:43.790 --> 07:47.410]  Like, that turned out not to be... like, that turned out to be misreported in some way, I believe.
[07:47.410 --> 07:49.970]  Was it like a Richard Gere gerbil situation?
[07:50.210 --> 07:53.190]  No, I think there was something to it, but I think... I don't know.
[07:53.270 --> 07:55.570]  I don't know the story, but I think it wasn't as nefarious as it seemed.
[07:55.870 --> 07:58.550]  However, what's his face from all the Christopher Guest movies?
[07:58.650 --> 08:00.050]  I think his was legit.
[08:00.310 --> 08:00.990]  Who is that?
[08:01.210 --> 08:01.810]  Fred Willard.
[08:02.250 --> 08:03.510]  Oh, R.I.P.
[08:03.750 --> 08:05.650]  Yeah, he's great. Did he have one of those?
[08:05.890 --> 08:08.590]  Yeah, he got busted jacking off in a theater, like, in his 70s.
[08:09.970 --> 08:12.130]  This is kind of funny, depending on the context.
[08:12.590 --> 08:12.870]  Yeah.
[08:12.870 --> 08:17.610]  I guess it really depends on the theater and what was playing for my level of okay with.
[08:17.970 --> 08:21.650]  It was... the weirdest thing is it was... it was a mighty wind.
[08:21.950 --> 08:23.230]  He was jacking off to his own shows.
[08:24.010 --> 08:26.250]  He saw Bob Balaban, whoever his name is.
[08:30.690 --> 08:34.050]  I agree. I don't... I don't know. I don't know what the point...
[08:34.050 --> 08:35.330]  It's just like a weird thing to people.
[08:35.390 --> 08:37.510]  When you think people have recorded, like, bootleg...
[08:38.370 --> 08:40.050]  Can you imagine, like, bootleg theater porn?
[08:40.050 --> 08:43.870]  As opposed to, like, when people would, like, illegally film movies.
[08:44.090 --> 08:48.290]  Have you ever watched somebody illegally film something in a movie theater before?
[08:48.690 --> 08:48.870]  No.
[08:49.130 --> 08:49.370]  No.
[08:49.470 --> 08:52.390]  I remember one time I was at the show and it was like...
[08:52.390 --> 08:54.590]  I don't remember what the movie was, but I've been out a long time.
[08:54.670 --> 08:56.390]  And it was just me and this one guy in the theater.
[08:56.610 --> 09:01.570]  And he pulled out a fucking tripod and he put a camera on a tripod at the back of the theater.
[09:02.390 --> 09:03.550]  This guy is wild.
[09:04.410 --> 09:05.270]  Did he get caught?
[09:05.490 --> 09:07.790]  No, I don't think... I think he... I don't know what he was there for.
[09:07.790 --> 09:11.090]  He left, like, shortly after, but he pulled a tripod out.
[09:11.150 --> 09:12.790]  And I was like, this is fucking ridiculous.
[09:13.050 --> 09:14.130]  Like, the level of confidence.
[09:14.650 --> 09:15.930]  What if he just had one of those...
[09:15.930 --> 09:19.710]  What are those things that people put on tripods to see if, like, architect people?
[09:20.210 --> 09:22.050]  They have, like, levels on them and stuff.
[09:22.390 --> 09:22.810]  They're levels.
[09:24.370 --> 09:25.010]  Survey equipment.
[09:25.250 --> 09:26.490]  Yeah, I just see them all the time.
[09:26.570 --> 09:28.190]  I just... I have no idea what they're doing, ever.
[09:28.470 --> 09:30.470]  I don't know. It's possible he worked for the theater.
[09:30.570 --> 09:32.050]  I don't even remember if he...
[09:32.050 --> 09:33.730]  I saw a camera, but he had a tripod.
[09:34.390 --> 09:35.730]  And I just thought, this is ridiculous.
[09:35.730 --> 09:39.450]  To bring in the confidence of bringing in a tripod is impressive to me.
[09:39.810 --> 09:41.550]  I love that level of not caring.
[09:41.790 --> 09:43.490]  The world has changed a lot since those days.
[09:43.770 --> 09:44.190]  It has.
[09:44.390 --> 09:46.570]  I'd like to see somebody in there with a boom mic.
[09:46.850 --> 09:51.710]  I mean, isn't this essentially an entire episode of Seinfeld
[09:51.710 --> 09:55.330]  when Kramer got caught up in pirating movies and...
[09:55.330 --> 09:55.410]  Is it?
[09:55.670 --> 09:58.410]  It was Death Blow was the movie they were trying to get.
[09:58.530 --> 10:00.350]  That's a great fake movie name.
[10:00.670 --> 10:01.090]  Death Blow.
[10:02.250 --> 10:03.110]  What's the one in Twilight?
[10:03.510 --> 10:04.870]  That's another great fake movie.
[10:04.870 --> 10:06.310]  It's like Killer Punch.
[10:06.430 --> 10:07.230]  Did you hear that?
[10:07.550 --> 10:08.350]  Did someone text you?
[10:08.370 --> 10:09.550]  What the fuck was that?
[10:17.880 --> 10:20.740]  Why are you putting your phone on silent?
[10:21.220 --> 10:22.640]  I'm gonna put my phone on silent.
[10:22.840 --> 10:23.020]  Sorry.
[10:23.280 --> 10:23.820]  That was odd.
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.560]  Jesus Christ, that's awesome.
[10:25.860 --> 10:28.400]  Have you talked about what's happened to you, Andrew?
[10:28.820 --> 10:29.460]  Uh, what?
[10:29.600 --> 10:30.900]  Well, what do you mean?
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.020]  In the pleasantries?
[10:32.320 --> 10:33.440]  In the last week?
[10:33.960 --> 10:34.220]  Yeah.
[10:34.520 --> 10:35.140]  Well, I mean...
[10:35.140 --> 10:38.720]  That was a strange pivot, because I felt like you were talking about the text thing,
[10:38.940 --> 10:40.240]  which I definitely have talked about.
[10:40.440 --> 10:41.560]  Well, yeah, we already talked about that.
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.160]  What we haven't talked about is how you're basically disabled this week.
[10:44.300 --> 10:45.440]  No, well...
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.400]  You know what the worst part of that whole experience is?
[10:47.420 --> 10:51.100]  Is that there's nothing all that entertaining about anything that happened.
[10:51.160 --> 10:53.620]  I was genuinely mad that, well, I had to go to the hospital,
[10:54.240 --> 10:56.000]  unexpectedly, because I had a foot issue.
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.760]  And typically, my ankle could put things heal in about a week, and it was not healing.
[11:01.180 --> 11:03.760]  So I was like, I think I need to finally get this checked out.
[11:03.760 --> 11:11.180]  So I did. The problem is, I live up, like, the most ridiculous 12 staircase setup.
[11:12.040 --> 11:12.840]  And I couldn't...
[11:12.840 --> 11:13.160]  Go ahead.
[11:13.320 --> 11:16.340]  I was gonna say, I feel like Gavin and I were very supportive of you in that moment,
[11:16.720 --> 11:19.320]  throwing out lots of options for ways to get down the stairs.
[11:19.560 --> 11:20.940]  I feel like we were trying to be very helpful.
[11:22.040 --> 11:24.640]  I don't remember if Gavin made a suggestion.
[11:24.860 --> 11:27.500]  Geoff suggested I sled down it, like Jack asked.
[11:27.500 --> 11:29.900]  Well, because you sent us a picture of a flight of stairs,
[11:30.100 --> 11:32.720]  and then you said something like, I have to do that four times.
[11:32.720 --> 11:36.320]  Yes, it's a lot.
[11:36.600 --> 11:37.640]  It's a lot of stairs.
[11:37.940 --> 11:39.060]  So I wheeled out.
[11:39.440 --> 11:42.060]  I called an ambulance that came and they evaluated.
[11:42.380 --> 11:43.300]  I explained the situation.
[11:43.700 --> 11:45.580]  I think the funniest part of that.
[11:45.720 --> 11:47.260]  Well, there are two parts of it that were funny.
[11:47.620 --> 11:49.700]  One, I've been reluctant.
[11:50.040 --> 11:53.320]  I think it's partially like an anxiety thing of not wanting to get checked out
[11:53.320 --> 11:55.780]  and also feeling like, oh, I'm not like dying.
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.520]  I don't think so.
[11:56.560 --> 11:57.040]  I'm fine.
[11:57.320 --> 11:58.140]  It heals in a week.
[11:58.140 --> 11:58.700]  Like, whatever.
[11:59.160 --> 11:59.860]  No big deal.
[11:59.860 --> 12:03.000]  So when we're going over like all the different things, the guy's like,
[12:03.040 --> 12:05.340]  are you taking any Advil or Tylenol or whatever?
[12:05.460 --> 12:08.100]  And I was like, yeah, I'm taking quite a bit right now to manage it.
[12:08.680 --> 12:09.040]  Yeah.
[12:09.160 --> 12:11.780]  And he's like, well, are you do you have any side effects from that?
[12:11.820 --> 12:12.780]  And I'm like, no, you know what?
[12:12.780 --> 12:15.320]  My stomach has been burning a little bit because of it.
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.580]  And I know that can be a byproduct of using those in large, large quantities.
[12:18.600 --> 12:20.020]  But outside of that, I'm doing pretty good.
[12:20.460 --> 12:23.600]  He's like, any shit or any shit in your blood?
[12:23.800 --> 12:24.840]  Great flub, Andrew.
[12:25.160 --> 12:25.820]  Any blood?
[12:27.660 --> 12:30.100]  He asked any blood in your shit, essentially.
[12:30.280 --> 12:31.760]  And I was like, no, I'm good there.
[12:31.840 --> 12:32.600]  No problems there.
[12:32.620 --> 12:34.860]  And he's like, OK, good, because if that if you had that,
[12:34.960 --> 12:36.920]  then that's when you really want to get checked out.
[12:37.100 --> 12:38.760]  I was just quietly like, oh shit.
[12:39.200 --> 12:40.380]  I was just quietly like, yep.
[12:40.460 --> 12:41.740]  I was freaking out last time.
[12:42.420 --> 12:43.660]  So we get through that.
[12:43.780 --> 12:46.620]  And then they're like, OK, we've looked at your foot with it.
[12:46.640 --> 12:48.160]  We have these issues with it.
[12:48.460 --> 12:49.940]  They're like, we think you should get checked out.
[12:49.980 --> 12:52.180]  I think it would make sense for us to take you to the hospital.
[12:52.580 --> 12:53.420]  We're going to do that.
[12:53.420 --> 12:56.740]  Now we just need to figure out the best way to accomplish this,
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.420]  because you can't walk at all and your stairs are ridiculously narrow and long and twisty.
[13:01.700 --> 13:03.040]  So they're in your house at this point.
[13:03.260 --> 13:03.980]  They're in my house.
[13:04.040 --> 13:04.500]  Yeah, it's two guys.
[13:04.520 --> 13:06.960]  How hard was it for them to find your house?
[13:07.340 --> 13:08.800]  Did they have to follow the McDonald's guy?
[13:09.180 --> 13:09.720]  They had to.
[13:09.720 --> 13:12.180]  Yeah, they had to call the McDonald's guy.
[13:12.260 --> 13:14.380]  They had to be waved out as a whole ordeal.
[13:14.760 --> 13:17.060]  But they get there and they're like, we're going to need to call.
[13:17.160 --> 13:21.580]  We're going to call the fire department, essentially, to figure out, get more muscle.
[13:21.740 --> 13:22.840]  They have other tools.
[13:22.840 --> 13:23.900]  We'll collaborate.
[13:24.140 --> 13:24.600]  We'll get this.
[13:24.700 --> 13:26.340]  We'll figure out a way for you to go down.
[13:26.460 --> 13:27.680]  I was like, OK, cool.
[13:27.800 --> 13:28.480]  So they do that.
[13:28.520 --> 13:34.500]  And then like 10 minutes later, there's seven firefighters on my stairwell, all looking up.
[13:34.600 --> 13:35.900]  It's like a team huddle.
[13:36.020 --> 13:39.520]  And they're just going back and forth on what the plan should be.
[13:39.740 --> 13:40.440]  I'm just listening.
[13:41.220 --> 13:45.760]  And before any of this happened, I thought, should I just, because everything else is fine.
[13:45.860 --> 13:51.400]  I thought, should I just slide down the stairs and then just wait at the bottom?
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.440]  And I think I could accomplish this.
[13:53.560 --> 13:54.660]  Yeah, like a little butt shimmy.
[13:54.800 --> 13:58.800]  Like a little butt, like a dog doing a butt shimmy across all my stairs.
[13:58.980 --> 14:00.240]  I was like, I think I can accomplish this.
[14:00.900 --> 14:03.340]  But I thought, I'll wait and I'll hear their opinions.
[14:03.500 --> 14:04.580]  I don't know what options they have.
[14:04.960 --> 14:07.240]  So there's like nine people at this point.
[14:07.600 --> 14:10.180]  And they came to the conclusion that the easiest way
[14:10.180 --> 14:13.200]  for me to do this would be as if I just slid down the stairs.
[14:13.440 --> 14:19.300]  So I have seven jacked firefighters all around me just watching.
[14:19.300 --> 14:21.480]  They turned into like just a peanut gallery.
[14:21.660 --> 14:24.380]  They just were like there for moral support at that point.
[14:24.740 --> 14:31.360]  So I'd ash shimmy down my stairs and then they'd grab my desk chair, put it behind me.
[14:31.440 --> 14:34.540]  I'd sit and then I'd push myself in the chair to the next set of stairs.
[14:35.100 --> 14:38.860]  And then I just did that all the way down to the front door to get in the bed.
[14:38.960 --> 14:40.860]  I like that that was the result of their huddle.
[14:41.200 --> 14:42.980]  Like they're like, that was young boy.
[14:43.280 --> 14:45.000]  All right, you're gonna shimmy down on your own.
[14:46.500 --> 14:51.180]  Do you realize that you just lived out every lonely bored housewife's fantasy
[14:51.180 --> 14:56.240]  to slide down carpeted stairs into the waiting arms of seven firefighters?
[14:56.680 --> 14:58.640]  I just thought the idea was somewhere else in Canada.
[14:58.800 --> 15:01.140]  They're like, freaking restaurants on fire.
[15:01.300 --> 15:08.080]  You have to wait. We got everyone deployed to a guy with a swollen ankle.
[15:08.180 --> 15:09.940]  We got a stair slide situation.
[15:10.520 --> 15:11.340]  We got a stair slide.
[15:11.340 --> 15:14.480]  All they did was say, good job.
[15:16.600 --> 15:19.040]  Did it sound patronizing or supportive?
[15:19.080 --> 15:20.520]  No, it seemed genuine.
[15:20.960 --> 15:24.300]  There was a lot of good jobs and like, oh, you should take a minute to take your breath.
[15:24.420 --> 15:25.720]  Like it was a lot of trying to make it.
[15:25.800 --> 15:26.820]  I'm good. I'm fine.
[15:26.960 --> 15:27.760]  We're just going to do this.
[15:28.260 --> 15:29.860]  So then I accomplished that.
[15:30.320 --> 15:31.180]  And then what else?
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.820]  Well, yeah, it was a noise, but it was funny.
[15:34.180 --> 15:36.460]  And then you had to do it in reverse, I assume, when you came home.
[15:36.800 --> 15:38.680]  No, well, that was the thing.
[15:38.800 --> 15:40.000]  I was like, well, how am I going to...
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.420]  I'm not really sure what the game plan is for getting back up.
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.140]  And I just was on so many...
[15:45.140 --> 15:48.060]  The whole thing, the whole exiting process wasn't the best.
[15:48.960 --> 15:51.360]  They did x-rays and blood work and all this stuff.
[15:51.460 --> 15:53.840]  And then they gave me what they believe was the issue with it.
[15:54.140 --> 15:57.260]  And they gave me a bunch of pain pills for it, essentially.
[15:58.040 --> 16:00.880]  And the person's like, hey, can you walk?
[16:01.300 --> 16:03.160]  And I was like, I don't think so, but I don't know.
[16:03.240 --> 16:05.040]  I haven't tried in like four or five hours.
[16:05.500 --> 16:07.340]  And they're like, OK, well, do you own...
[16:07.340 --> 16:08.340]  They didn't offer me anything.
[16:08.340 --> 16:10.360]  They weren't like, we have crutches or a wheelchair.
[16:10.480 --> 16:11.980]  They're like, do you own any of that stuff?
[16:12.040 --> 16:13.120]  And I was like, not really.
[16:13.480 --> 16:15.740]  No, they're like, well, can you walk?
[16:15.780 --> 16:16.880]  And I was like, I don't think so.
[16:16.940 --> 16:19.920]  And they're like, cool, we'll come back in like 15 minutes and try to figure this out.
[16:20.460 --> 16:21.800]  And they never came back.
[16:22.180 --> 16:26.880]  So I just slowly limped out of my room with...
[16:26.880 --> 16:27.240]  I didn't...
[16:27.240 --> 16:29.360]  My foot was too swollen to put on my shoes.
[16:29.580 --> 16:34.460]  So I'm barefoot, just slowly staggering through the hospital by myself.
[16:34.660 --> 16:38.100]  And then just go out the door and hop in a car and get taken home.
[16:38.100 --> 16:42.540]  And then I just walked up all the stairs, just very slowly using the railing.
[16:42.600 --> 16:45.660]  Are you wearing regulation Andrew Panton shorts this whole time?
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.500]  I had been wearing regulation underwear for like the past six days.
[16:49.520 --> 16:50.740]  Well, not even some...
[16:50.740 --> 16:51.940]  So you weren't even in shorts?
[16:52.160 --> 16:53.640]  No, I was going full Winnie the...
[16:53.640 --> 16:55.800]  I was Winnie the Pooh in it for a lot of the days.
[16:56.260 --> 16:56.780]  All right.
[16:56.920 --> 16:57.440]  And then...
[16:57.440 --> 16:59.780]  No, I put on shorts for the transport.
[16:59.780 --> 17:02.420]  So you didn't Winnie the Pooh in your butt shuffles down the stairs?
[17:02.440 --> 17:04.800]  I did not Winnie the Pooh butt shuffle down.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.060]  Donald Duck it down the stairs.
[17:06.660 --> 17:07.060]  No.
[17:08.840 --> 17:10.500]  Seven firefighters just look away.
[17:12.400 --> 17:13.680]  Don't look at me!
[17:13.940 --> 17:14.680]  While Andrew goes,
[17:17.340 --> 17:20.300]  Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
[17:20.580 --> 17:21.080]  Yeah, of course.
[17:21.200 --> 17:24.340]  I was listening to the episode that just came out, which, you know,
[17:24.380 --> 17:29.480]  I make a practice of not doing, but for some reason, well, honestly, it's because I can't,
[17:30.200 --> 17:32.160]  this fucking COVID dude, it's driving me nuts.
[17:32.240 --> 17:34.080]  I can't go anywhere. I can't do anything. I'm so fucking bored.
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.980]  So, uh, I was listening to... I got so miserable that I decided to listen to our content.
[17:39.360 --> 17:42.300]  Which was F*** Face Stadium Jingle Jingle Jingle.
[17:42.420 --> 17:47.560]  Yes. What the f... Did we ever answer what the Jingle Jingle Jingle mystery is? Did we cover that?
[17:48.380 --> 17:51.660]  We haven't, but I don't know. I kind of want to see more people guess.
[17:51.660 --> 17:55.540]  You said it two episodes, and so this would be the third episode since then.
[17:55.560 --> 18:00.440]  Well, you know what is funny, Geoff, is we have done zero in the history of this entire podcast,
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.940]  we have never done any show prep together, as a group, or exchanged notes on what we want to
[18:06.940 --> 18:11.560]  talk about. And I attempted once, and I feel like I got shit on by you for it, in the episode.
[18:11.880 --> 18:13.320]  By who? By you!
[18:13.580 --> 18:17.820]  I was definitely making fun of your process, because it was ridiculous, but I still loved it.
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.560]  What do you mean it was ridiculous? I was writing notes to, like,
[18:20.760 --> 18:22.620]  to try to distribute, like, this many...
[18:24.760 --> 18:28.420]  Album, f***ing tracks and stuff. It was great. I loved it. I absolutely loved it.
[18:28.420 --> 18:33.520]  I'm saying that I tried to do prep for one time, and I got shit on for it, so I don't need to bring
[18:33.520 --> 18:37.540]  up the jingle jingle, because I didn't... it's not needed. Apparently we're not going to do that.
[18:37.820 --> 18:41.140]  No show prep. But I want to hear people's predictions.
[18:41.600 --> 18:44.720]  I have no idea what just happened. Three episodes ago, you said,
[18:44.860 --> 18:47.020]  I'm going to tell you what it is in two episodes.
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.400]  No, because that was under the assumption that we're recording 12 episodes in four days,
[18:52.460 --> 18:56.160]  which is what I was under. So I thought, this is the first time we need to.
[18:56.160 --> 18:59.900]  And people seem to be interested in the jingle jingle jingle thing.
[19:00.380 --> 19:04.340]  And I also talked to you about the jingle jingle jingle thing and discussing it and
[19:04.340 --> 19:06.400]  the timing of discussing it. I don't remember.
[19:06.700 --> 19:11.180]  Yeah, clearly. Clearly you don't remember. Are you telling me I know the answer to the
[19:11.180 --> 19:13.660]  jingle jingle jingle mystery? You know.
[19:14.080 --> 19:15.780]  No, he doesn't. You didn't say that in front of him.
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.560]  No, I didn't tell him what the answer to the mystery is. But I told you when we should talk
[19:21.560 --> 19:25.540]  about it and why we should talk about that. And you agreed. And then you just said,
[19:25.540 --> 19:28.700]  nope, and just flushed that information away. I don't remember that part.
[19:28.820 --> 19:30.560]  I don't know. You were not there for that, Gavin.
[19:30.760 --> 19:35.520]  Oh, it was during the pre-show prep that we always do. We prepare our where we prepare our
[19:35.520 --> 19:38.740]  bits. I'm pretty sure it was a slack conversation between you and I.
[19:38.840 --> 19:42.380]  I don't know. I just want to know. I'm right there with the audience wondering what the
[19:42.380 --> 19:44.500]  fuck it is. I just want to make. Are you going to address it someday?
[19:44.920 --> 19:47.580]  Absolutely. Okay. I don't care when I as long as it doesn't get dropped.
[19:47.720 --> 19:51.820]  No, it will never get dropped. I just I'd like to see a week of people predicting.
[19:51.820 --> 19:55.320]  I think you're blue ball in the audience because they you teased it.
[19:55.660 --> 19:59.640]  You're I fucking you're the worst and you don't mean to be. You're being the worst right now.
[19:59.640 --> 20:02.240]  You have no idea how annoying you're being right now.
[20:02.760 --> 20:05.180]  Geoff doesn't remember the instructions that I'm not allowed to know.
[20:05.340 --> 20:09.940]  He's ridiculous. He's infuriating. I love you, Geoff, but you're infuriating.
[20:10.740 --> 20:15.680]  I mean, in fairness, there's nothing more forgettable than the episode recorded between
[20:15.680 --> 20:19.800]  the one you're in the middle of making and the one that just came out. I couldn't tell you
[20:19.800 --> 20:23.920]  what he discussed a week ago. No clue. That's why I asked if we covered it,
[20:23.960 --> 20:26.540]  because I was listening to the episode and I thought, jingle, jingle,
[20:26.640 --> 20:29.560]  jingle. Do I know what that is? And I thought we must have dealt with it.
[20:29.800 --> 20:32.640]  No, I thought, fuck, I better ask the guys because I my old ass forgot.
[20:33.720 --> 20:36.740]  So if you had told me, yeah, we covered that in episode 90, idiot.
[20:36.780 --> 20:39.060]  I would have been like, oh, I'll wait till it comes out and listen to it.
[20:39.180 --> 20:43.400]  We have not. But you know what? We have we have gotten a lot of and I want to hear
[20:43.400 --> 20:48.080]  one here. Your two two opinions on this is the field research has been done
[20:48.080 --> 20:51.600]  getting a lot of successful reports back of the hot cake, happy meal hack.
[20:51.780 --> 20:55.940]  Any any opinions changed? Any reverse of thoughts? You're both against it.
[20:56.400 --> 20:59.800]  I'm seeing a lot of reports of it working. It's beyond just my store.
[21:00.100 --> 21:03.020]  Oh, is that what the jingle, jingle, jingle is?
[21:03.040 --> 21:05.060]  No, has nothing to do with that. Completely unrelated.
[21:05.820 --> 21:08.700]  Refresh my memory. No opinion. You guys were both very strongly.
[21:08.740 --> 21:12.220]  This isn't a hack. This is bullshit. The research has come out.
[21:12.300 --> 21:16.080]  I've seen a bunch of people report that they've gotten three hot cakes with their happy meal.
[21:16.080 --> 21:19.720]  Unfortunately, appears to be more of a Canadian thing than it is in America.
[21:20.080 --> 21:23.960]  Doesn't seem like many American locations have it. All right, let me ask you this.
[21:24.420 --> 21:27.440]  I'll answer your I'll answer your question with a question. Thank you.
[21:27.600 --> 21:30.580]  I appreciate that. How kind of you.
[21:30.760 --> 21:33.120]  So you're buying I'm gonna make sure I get this straight.
[21:33.440 --> 21:37.960]  You're buying pancakes from McDonald's and you're getting an extra one and you think it's this
[21:37.960 --> 21:39.440]  amazing hack, right? Yes.
[21:39.540 --> 21:43.460]  Don't you have 70 pounds of pancake mix in your house?
[21:43.460 --> 21:45.900]  Let me counter this for you. OK, this is a really.
[21:46.120 --> 21:47.540]  You're absolutely correct. I do.
[21:47.840 --> 21:53.140]  I'm not saying that this is for me the most cost effective thing.
[21:53.240 --> 21:56.140]  Like, obviously, I'm taking a luxury and I'm ordering a thing.
[21:56.280 --> 21:59.380]  I could technically make myself one pancake set.
[21:59.480 --> 22:01.280]  McDonald's tastes differently than the ones I make.
[22:01.340 --> 22:04.060]  I really enjoy the taste of the McDonald's hot cakes, too.
[22:04.600 --> 22:08.260]  It's a cheaper way to get a thing I enjoy, and it's a small luxury.
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.280]  I feel for myself every week. I'm not the best at eating breakfast.
[22:12.280 --> 22:15.180]  I forget a lot of the time to just eat it. It's a meal I don't always have.
[22:15.440 --> 22:20.080]  But I've made it a tradition that on a recording day, I get to treat myself in the morning and
[22:20.080 --> 22:23.520]  I at least have a breakfast going into it. What if you take two of the McDonald's
[22:23.520 --> 22:30.000]  ones and make the third one yourself? Oh, like, like, get the two.
[22:30.060 --> 22:35.400]  What if you donate your pancake mix to McDonald's and then they can make your pancakes for you?
[22:35.620 --> 22:39.640]  Oh, and then when you get the pancake back, you'll know that maybe some of it came from you.
[22:39.640 --> 22:42.820]  I've been looking at donating most of my pancake mix, but unfortunately with
[22:42.820 --> 22:46.620]  Covid and stuff, there's not a lot of places that are taking it to make pancakes.
[22:50.420 --> 22:53.780]  Eric said, I don't think McDonald's wants anything from Andrew. I think that's correct.
[22:53.940 --> 23:01.120]  I think it's a factual statement outside of outside of one particular set of items from them.
[23:01.220 --> 23:05.580]  I think if the if the world ends, if there's big like big fat nuclear winter,
[23:06.240 --> 23:09.480]  you're going to have the weirdest collection of stuff.
[23:09.480 --> 23:14.000]  You're going to be a bottle cap millionaire. Just from people that hear about the guy who's
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.800]  got the pancakes and the sauces. It's like not something you'd expect from a regular abode.
[23:18.940 --> 23:22.260]  This is what I'm going to say to that, though. OK, let's say nuclear winter happens,
[23:22.320 --> 23:27.380]  right? I'd rather have the group of people that are coming into my house. They're coming after
[23:27.380 --> 23:32.720]  if if they if there's like a takeover scenario, people like whatever. I'd rather have the
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.860]  pancake people than all the horny jerk off people that you will have fucking car batteries.
[23:37.860 --> 23:40.580]  You're in the jack off capital in Austin.
[23:41.360 --> 23:44.140]  I want to get electrocuted and jacked off at the same time.
[23:44.180 --> 23:47.220]  Yeah, because he's a battery beat off, dude.
[23:48.800 --> 23:50.060]  The battery beater.
[23:53.140 --> 23:54.580]  That's an excellent point, Andrew.
[23:54.840 --> 23:55.860]  There's a lead on this fridge.
[23:56.240 --> 23:58.740]  I don't mind. I can make I can share the pancakes.
[23:59.100 --> 24:02.780]  We wanted to do a pancake bath at some point, but I think that's a terrible idea.
[24:03.220 --> 24:06.760]  I guess I talked about mixing it right when I had my pancake maker in the bathroom.
[24:06.760 --> 24:10.960]  What if we lit a fire under the tub? Could you just make a big pancake?
[24:12.960 --> 24:13.880]  Would it cook through?
[24:14.500 --> 24:19.120]  I don't I don't know how that you'd have to like balance it, right? So it's not melting the tub.
[24:19.240 --> 24:22.280]  There's probably a certain distance you could have where the heat would flow.
[24:22.900 --> 24:27.840]  We could put you in a tub with pancake mix, cook it up, and you'd have to eat your way out.
[24:28.260 --> 24:30.140]  No, I don't think that would work.
[24:30.280 --> 24:32.460]  I feel like, well, I think it would burn me, right?
[24:32.760 --> 24:34.820]  Uh, we'd like we'd stir it.
[24:35.900 --> 24:39.480]  That's not what we put you in a fire retardant suit.
[24:39.560 --> 24:44.040]  OK, if we did that, then, yeah, I'd absolutely be completely fine with this premise.
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.100]  But it can't be. I think it needs to be larger. It needs to be, you know, like in a movie,
[24:48.100 --> 24:52.700]  like in Creepshow, when fucking Ted Danson gets buried up to his neck in sand.
[24:52.720 --> 24:54.360]  Like it needs to be that the pancake.
[24:54.580 --> 24:57.340]  But you need to have your head underneath because you got to eat out.
[24:57.500 --> 25:00.300]  No, my head isn't going to be underneath the pancake.
[25:00.300 --> 25:03.200]  We need you basically in a tub with a snorkel.
[25:03.300 --> 25:03.920]  Oh, yeah.
[25:03.920 --> 25:08.480]  And then as as it sets, we rip the snorkel out and you have to scoff your way out.
[25:08.520 --> 25:12.160]  No, this is not the fucking worst David Blaine stunt of all time.
[25:12.260 --> 25:14.000]  Give me air. Allow me to breathe.
[25:14.400 --> 25:15.780]  And it's coming down the snorkel.
[25:16.120 --> 25:19.300]  I don't want a snorkel. Why can't I just have my head exposed and start
[25:19.300 --> 25:22.900]  slowly eating away from just my neck area down, loosening up?
[25:22.960 --> 25:23.880]  Then I get an arm free.
[25:24.180 --> 25:25.640]  What are you not a snorkel guy?
[25:25.920 --> 25:29.280]  I'm not a snorkel guy. I've never been a snorkel guy. I'm bad at the snorkel.
[25:29.280 --> 25:31.740]  I've tried it once. I wasn't good at it. Don't trust it.
[25:31.960 --> 25:34.320]  Is it just the act of breathing underwater that you don't like?
[25:34.440 --> 25:36.100]  Just knowing that your head is underwater?
[25:36.380 --> 25:38.160]  Yeah, it's not a thing I regularly do.
[25:38.660 --> 25:41.920]  And I think I tried it once as a kid and it went horribly wrong.
[25:42.220 --> 25:43.160]  And I just didn't do it again.
[25:43.260 --> 25:44.580]  Let me let me posit this then.
[25:45.100 --> 25:49.860]  Maybe it's time for a snorkel redemption and pancake snorkeling.
[25:49.980 --> 25:53.040]  I think it sounds like the perfect vehicle.
[25:53.240 --> 25:56.460]  This is the other 2022, the pancake snorkel redemption.
[25:56.660 --> 25:57.340]  I love it.
[25:57.340 --> 26:02.720]  I don't trust being blinded, essentially, and unable to move with the two of you
[26:02.720 --> 26:06.060]  fuckers being in the area and just being able to do whatever you want.
[26:06.140 --> 26:06.740]  I don't want that.
[26:06.880 --> 26:09.340]  We've talked about it. I've let Geoff bury me in a coffin once.
[26:09.620 --> 26:10.100]  I did.
[26:11.100 --> 26:16.280]  Andrew, we nailed it down and then we covered it in dirt.
[26:16.720 --> 26:17.720]  He was in there.
[26:17.740 --> 26:19.260]  What does that mean? What does that mean?
[26:19.460 --> 26:21.380]  How far down was he? How much dirt did he have?
[26:21.960 --> 26:24.040]  Not that far. Not that much. But that's not the point.
[26:24.600 --> 26:26.140]  No, fucking exactly.
[26:26.140 --> 26:27.840]  You just laid down in a bed.
[26:27.940 --> 26:29.920]  They poured a pebble over you and you're like, I fuck it.
[26:30.040 --> 26:32.360]  I had an air hole and an air pipe.
[26:32.520 --> 26:35.600]  And there was a big, like, digger putting mud on me.
[26:35.680 --> 26:39.440]  Okay, how about if you fucking have the Ryan Reynolds buried experience?
[26:39.600 --> 26:41.060]  You get buried like six feet.
[26:41.320 --> 26:42.780]  All you get is a lighter and a phone.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.640]  Then I'll do pancake thing. No problem.
[26:44.860 --> 26:47.840]  Well, does that mean we can put you six feet under pancake?
[26:48.380 --> 26:50.140]  Because we're talking inches here, man.
[26:50.240 --> 26:51.720]  Yeah, it's got to equate.
[26:51.840 --> 26:53.100]  I would go six feet under pancake.
[26:53.300 --> 26:54.580]  Okay, do I get any condiments?
[26:54.580 --> 26:55.980]  Any, any, any topping?
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.000]  Any sides with this?
[26:57.300 --> 26:58.360]  Do I get like some syrup?
[26:58.720 --> 27:03.140]  Yeah, we'll give you like, we'll give you like a bag full of little butter pats and individual
[27:03.140 --> 27:07.060]  bag of syrup that you can rip open and rip it open one at a time.
[27:07.220 --> 27:11.740]  Am I allowed to use it as lubrication to try to squeeze out of the pancake?
[27:12.020 --> 27:12.300]  Yes.
[27:12.480 --> 27:12.840]  Okay.
[27:13.080 --> 27:13.860]  Well, this is...
[27:13.860 --> 27:15.620]  It's you eat how you eat, Andrew.
[27:15.740 --> 27:16.480]  I'm not going to get in.
[27:16.540 --> 27:19.440]  I don't, I don't like the idea of eating pancake with a shovel.
[27:19.880 --> 27:21.740]  Like having that much that you need.
[27:22.340 --> 27:24.680]  I like the idea of using syrup as lube.
[27:24.820 --> 27:25.360]  Isn't that the opposite?
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.100]  I like the idea that your body is the syrup, is the syrup.
[27:28.280 --> 27:28.600]  Syrup.
[27:29.200 --> 27:30.400]  Syrup distribution method.
[27:30.640 --> 27:31.320]  Syrup XM.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.960]  I feel like I'd get all slippery if I covered myself in syrup.
[27:34.320 --> 27:35.160]  But I think there's a window.
[27:35.280 --> 27:35.760]  I think you're right.
[27:35.800 --> 27:37.680]  It eventually hardens and then would become an issue.
[27:37.780 --> 27:40.340]  But I think there'd be a brief window in which I'd be all slippery.
[27:45.570 --> 27:48.330]  When you use the bathroom, you always close the door behind you, right?
[27:48.690 --> 27:50.630]  You don't want random passerbys looking in on you.
[27:50.730 --> 27:53.090]  So why would you let people look in on you when you go online?
[27:53.090 --> 27:57.250]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like going to the bathroom and not closing the door.
[27:57.630 --> 28:00.910]  Did you know that your internet service provider knows every single website you visit?
[28:01.310 --> 28:04.390]  And what's worse is they can sell this information to ad companies and tech giants
[28:04.390 --> 28:05.990]  who will use their data to target you.
[28:06.450 --> 28:07.970]  ExpressVPN puts a stop to this.
[28:08.150 --> 28:11.390]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet
[28:11.390 --> 28:13.970]  so that your online activity can't be seen by anyone.
[28:14.290 --> 28:16.390]  I use ExpressVPN on all my devices.
[28:16.610 --> 28:19.190]  It works on everything, phones, laptops, even routers.
[28:19.190 --> 28:23.950]  So everyone who shares your Wi-Fi can still be protected even if they don't have ExpressVPN.
[28:24.490 --> 28:27.250]  It's very easy to use and privacy is important to me.
[28:27.550 --> 28:31.270]  And the best part is using ExpressVPN is as easy as closing the bathroom door.
[28:31.690 --> 28:34.290]  You just fire up the app, click one button, and you're protected.
[28:35.050 --> 28:39.790]  ExpressVPN is the world's number one rated VPN by Mashable, The Verge, and countless others.
[28:40.350 --> 28:43.910]  So if you're like me and believe your online activity is your business,

[29:07.070 --> 29:08.230]  Relationships take work.
[29:08.390 --> 29:11.290]  A lot of us will drop anything to go help someone we care about.
[29:11.630 --> 29:13.490]  We'll go out of our way to treat other people well,
[29:13.490 --> 29:16.050]  but how often do we give ourselves the same treatment?
[29:16.530 --> 29:20.410]  This is something that I have absolutely struggled with in my life and still have issues with it.
[29:20.490 --> 29:24.730]  At times, I found therapy to be very helpful in dealing with it,
[29:24.770 --> 29:30.230]  as well as some forms of self-care that I've worked out in kind of the last few years.
[29:30.670 --> 29:34.070]  But this month, BetterHelp Online Therapy wants to remind you to take care of your
[29:34.070 --> 29:37.170]  most important relationship, the one you have with yourself.
[29:37.510 --> 29:41.470]  Whether it's hitting the gym, making time for your haircut, or even trying therapy,
[29:41.470 --> 29:43.410]  you are your greatest asset.
[29:43.970 --> 29:47.070]  So invest the time and effort into yourself like you do for other people.
[29:47.770 --> 29:51.870]  If you're somebody who is considering therapy, but just haven't
[29:51.870 --> 29:54.230]  pushed forward with it, maybe because it can be scary.
[29:54.290 --> 29:57.330]  I know I was certainly scared the first time I started therapy or
[29:57.890 --> 30:00.210]  worried about the stigma that could be attached with it.
[30:00.310 --> 30:02.990]  I suggest you please attempt it.
[30:03.190 --> 30:05.190]  It's something that I found to be incredibly helpful,
[30:06.010 --> 30:09.090]  and I hope it would be helpful for you as well.
[30:09.090 --> 30:13.450]  BetterHelp is online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions
[30:13.450 --> 30:17.270]  with your therapist so you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[30:17.850 --> 30:20.250]  It's much more affordable than in-person therapy,
[30:20.450 --> 30:23.310]  and you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.

[30:44.330 --> 30:48.170]  I found out something recently, Andrew, about where you live.
[30:48.570 --> 30:51.290]  Is this about, like, the maple syrup reserves or something, I'm assuming?
[30:51.770 --> 30:53.550]  Vancouver has banned doorknobs?
[30:53.790 --> 30:57.210]  Starting March 14th, all new buildings erect in the city will have to include
[30:57.210 --> 30:59.810]  lever handles on their doors rather than round the knob.
[30:59.810 --> 31:05.550]  Not only do a lot of the comment leavers agree with me on the doorknob front,
[31:06.050 --> 31:12.290]  the entirety of Vancouver, knobs are illegal on new builds in Vancouver since 2014.
[31:12.810 --> 31:14.550]  Did you have any idea of this?
[31:14.910 --> 31:16.250]  No. Weird.
[31:16.670 --> 31:17.010]  Knobs are out.
[31:18.710 --> 31:22.470]  They're trying to, Andrew, they're trying to take your doorknob freedom.
[31:22.850 --> 31:25.570]  I'm okay with that. As I said, I'm kind of indifferent to the...
[31:26.110 --> 31:27.470]  I don't really... I'm trying to think, like,
[31:27.470 --> 31:31.170]  last time I encountered a doorknob in the wild. I don't think it's been a while.
[31:31.230 --> 31:32.630]  It's clearly not been since 2013.
[31:32.990 --> 31:33.730]  And it makes total sense.
[31:33.930 --> 31:36.650]  What a weird thing to outlaw.
[31:36.870 --> 31:40.550]  People without functioning hands to be able to use doors. It makes total sense.
[31:40.790 --> 31:41.410]  That does make sense.
[31:41.550 --> 31:43.930]  That does make sense. I was going to say why, like,
[31:43.970 --> 31:48.450]  what would be the thing that would lead to that level of wanting it changed?
[31:48.650 --> 31:52.330]  Like, who would bring that to the floor to get that approved? But that makes sense.
[31:52.590 --> 31:54.490]  Yeah, now that you mentioned that part, yeah.
[31:54.630 --> 31:56.590]  That is a fun fact, Gavin. It is illegal.
[31:56.590 --> 31:59.630]  Do you think there's somebody who's rebellious that's like,
[31:59.710 --> 32:02.010]  I'm going to put a fucking doorknob at my door?
[32:02.470 --> 32:06.390]  Do you think you can go to the local Home Depot in Vancouver and be like,
[32:06.470 --> 32:07.710]  yeah, I'd like to buy one of these doorknobs?
[32:07.750 --> 32:11.830]  And the guy's like, I can sell it to you, but I have to let you know you can't install it.
[32:12.310 --> 32:15.950]  I don't think they're even on the shelves. I bet he takes you around the back of the store.
[32:16.050 --> 32:16.290]  Yeah.
[32:16.390 --> 32:19.410]  And there's like a rag over a load of boxes of doorknobs.
[32:19.530 --> 32:21.350]  I was going to say, if you wanted a doorknob,
[32:21.430 --> 32:24.550]  you could only buy them through the hot dog guy in front of the store.
[32:24.550 --> 32:28.750]  It's the only place. It's technically within the grounds of the building,
[32:28.750 --> 32:31.010]  but they're not associated with it. It's a backdoor deal.
[32:31.110 --> 32:33.450]  Do you have hot dog guys in the front of your Home Depot, too?
[32:33.630 --> 32:36.610]  Absolutely. Yeah, it's a great staple. It's a staple of Home Depot.
[32:36.830 --> 32:40.430]  That must be like every Home Depot must have a hot dog guy in front of them,
[32:40.450 --> 32:41.510]  or a taco guy in Texas.
[32:41.790 --> 32:44.410]  It's not every Home Depot, but a lot of them do.
[32:44.590 --> 32:47.190]  And they have different agreements depending on the store.
[32:47.590 --> 32:51.130]  So they're typically not hired by the store, but it was an idea that
[32:51.650 --> 32:55.970]  essentially, and it's sort of up to debate who is the first person to do it.
[32:56.350 --> 33:01.150]  But the common thread was a place where people could buy a snack while getting a product.
[33:01.630 --> 33:05.610]  I watched a whole thing about hot dogs and Home Depot and that thing, but I don't remember
[33:06.170 --> 33:07.450]  a lot of the details on it.
[33:07.730 --> 33:12.190]  It was, yeah. It's just funny that it's awesome, too, because they're very territorial,
[33:12.650 --> 33:14.710]  because there are some Lowe's that do the same thing.
[33:15.130 --> 33:19.430]  And there's a real rivalry between the Lowe's hot dog people and the Home Depot hot dog people.
[33:19.530 --> 33:21.110]  They're like, no, we don't fuck around with Lowe's.
[33:21.130 --> 33:23.690]  Are you a Home Depot or a Lowe's person?
[33:23.930 --> 33:26.010]  I don't think I have Lowe's in Canada.
[33:26.250 --> 33:29.170]  There's at least not one where I live, I don't think.
[33:29.570 --> 33:34.010]  You know, it's weird is to like because of COVID, I've remained in my space
[33:34.010 --> 33:36.450]  so as much as possible for like three years now.
[33:36.610 --> 33:39.850]  So I don't necessarily know what buildings are in different parts of the city.
[33:39.910 --> 33:41.230]  I just haven't visited.
[33:41.530 --> 33:46.250]  I was looking at a Japanese restaurant that's my favorite in the city,
[33:46.250 --> 33:48.910]  and I was just scrolling through Google images of it.
[33:49.630 --> 33:53.130]  And I was like, this idiot took a photo of the wrong restaurant.
[33:53.230 --> 33:55.190]  What a what a ridiculous thing that is.
[33:55.250 --> 33:56.630]  And then I realized it was the right restaurant.
[33:56.830 --> 34:00.970]  They just remodeled and I haven't been there in like three years because of COVID.
[34:01.370 --> 34:02.090]  So it's wild.
[34:02.230 --> 34:06.530]  So if we do have a Lowe's, I'm not aware of it, but I guess it's possible that it exists.
[34:06.990 --> 34:08.130]  Hey, it's weird to live in.
[34:08.230 --> 34:08.610]  Go ahead.
[34:08.770 --> 34:10.490]  No, go ahead. Before it's weird to live in what?
[34:10.630 --> 34:13.330]  I was going to say it's weird to live in a small town and not feel like,
[34:13.410 --> 34:15.370]  you know, all the main stores to it.
[34:15.590 --> 34:17.290]  That's been a strange byproduct of COVID.
[34:17.290 --> 34:19.970]  That was weird. Geoff simultaneously let you continue,
[34:20.090 --> 34:22.210]  but also like started telling his shit at the same time.
[34:23.270 --> 34:23.890]  Did I?
[34:24.790 --> 34:27.550]  You were like before. No, go ahead. Before.
[34:31.610 --> 34:32.890]  I'm all discombobulated.
[34:33.130 --> 34:33.450]  Why is that?
[34:33.490 --> 34:33.850]  Why are you?
[34:34.170 --> 34:37.710]  Oh, I'm just I'm just fucking all loopy from the cold medicine shit.
[34:37.890 --> 34:38.230]  Oh, yeah.
[34:38.450 --> 34:41.010]  And fucking being sequestered, quarantined, whatever.
[34:41.270 --> 34:44.850]  Uh, I have three little things I'd like to talk about before we end.
[34:44.850 --> 34:48.430]  But if I don't know what you guys want to cover, we're only halfway through.
[34:48.670 --> 34:50.930]  Yeah. Feel free. I'd love to hear your thanks.
[34:51.110 --> 34:54.210]  I saw a this is just a comment I saw on the site.
[34:54.370 --> 34:56.230]  I believe I was looking for the last episode.
[34:56.710 --> 34:57.810]  Someone named Mr.
[34:57.850 --> 35:02.750]  Steel Crayon said we should make baseball bats that have door handles instead of knobs.
[35:04.570 --> 35:05.530]  And sell them.
[35:06.090 --> 35:11.050]  Which, you know, I got to say, I think he's onto something there.
[35:11.270 --> 35:12.990]  I mean, that would probably do better than the skateboard.
[35:12.990 --> 35:16.910]  I was yeah, I was going to try to build one for the recording of this episode,
[35:17.070 --> 35:17.910]  but I got distracted.
[35:18.130 --> 35:19.990]  I will. Oh, we could sell them in Vancouver.
[35:20.090 --> 35:21.370]  We can only sell them in Vancouver.
[35:22.570 --> 35:25.530]  Technically, we shouldn't have been sending those baseball bats to Vancouver.
[35:25.710 --> 35:27.670]  Jesus Christ, we were sending illegal knobs.
[35:28.110 --> 35:31.130]  Yeah, I think it's going to be a functional door handle.
[35:31.310 --> 35:32.490]  Like, is it going to actually be able to turn?
[35:32.710 --> 35:34.030]  I think I would assume so.
[35:34.350 --> 35:38.710]  I hope big I hope big handle doesn't get a doesn't hear about us
[35:38.710 --> 35:41.310]  and crush us with the door handle lobby.
[35:41.310 --> 35:44.770]  I'd be OK as long as we firmly align with big knob.
[35:45.030 --> 35:48.950]  I'm not scared of big handle as long as we are close to big knob.
[35:49.130 --> 35:50.030]  As long as we're close to big knob.
[35:50.190 --> 35:51.350]  The other thing is real fast.
[35:51.690 --> 35:54.890]  So the other day, I haven't opened it up yet, but I know they're there.
[35:55.150 --> 35:57.030]  I was going to wait till I'm COVID free.
[35:57.530 --> 36:03.330]  But the other day, a box of fucking wrist pockets showed up at my house.
[36:03.630 --> 36:04.710]  Oh, my God, we made them.
[36:04.890 --> 36:06.410]  Yeah, I got to remember.
[36:07.010 --> 36:07.790]  I got it.
[36:08.650 --> 36:09.490]  Here's the problem.
[36:09.490 --> 36:10.850]  Somebody's got to tell him.
[36:11.030 --> 36:15.350]  I I don't know that I'm always serious when I say we we should make this stuff.
[36:15.510 --> 36:20.070]  We have meetings and in more than one meeting, you're adamant about making these.
[36:20.190 --> 36:21.810]  This isn't a one and done.
[36:22.210 --> 36:23.170]  Yes, yes, there are.
[36:23.210 --> 36:24.430]  And there are slacks.
[36:24.830 --> 36:26.310]  There are messages to one another.
[36:26.770 --> 36:29.070]  OK, I was going to I would let it slide.
[36:29.330 --> 36:30.790]  I would I would have let it slide.
[36:30.950 --> 36:35.350]  If you didn't just try to absolve yourself of responsibility for this.
[36:35.730 --> 36:37.350]  Why doesn't somebody stop me sometimes?
[36:37.350 --> 36:38.790]  Like I don't judge.
[36:39.210 --> 36:39.950]  I guess I would.
[36:40.150 --> 36:41.190]  You know, it's like a quorum.
[36:41.370 --> 36:45.030]  Not only did we talk about this several times in those meetings.
[36:45.150 --> 36:48.130]  Like, I feel like this has been discussed three or four meetings at this point,
[36:48.270 --> 36:49.010]  which is quite a while.
[36:49.430 --> 36:51.710]  You volunteered to like sign them.
[36:51.890 --> 36:52.750]  That's my questions.
[36:53.230 --> 36:58.730]  I remember being mad at Eric and you for trying to gaslight me because I was supposed to do
[36:58.730 --> 37:00.030]  something with him that I didn't agree to.
[37:00.210 --> 37:01.750]  But obviously, they're at my house.
[37:01.770 --> 37:03.330]  So what am I supposed to do with them?
[37:03.350 --> 37:04.170]  Because I'm going to do it.
[37:04.510 --> 37:05.930]  I just don't know what to do.
[37:06.090 --> 37:07.250]  That's why I bring it up.
[37:07.250 --> 37:13.210]  Aren't you supposed to write like wrist pocket or whatever and then like sign it or like number it?
[37:14.330 --> 37:15.390]  I don't know.
[37:15.570 --> 37:16.830]  You have these ideas.
[37:17.050 --> 37:18.270]  What do you want me to do?
[37:18.610 --> 37:19.110]  I don't know.
[37:19.330 --> 37:20.490]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[37:20.690 --> 37:23.570]  What would you like me to do in the future, Geoff?
[37:23.830 --> 37:25.170]  Okay, here's what I want you to do.
[37:25.250 --> 37:25.510]  Okay.
[37:25.750 --> 37:28.970]  Just just remember what it was I was supposed to do with them.
[37:29.050 --> 37:29.990]  I'm happy to do it.
[37:30.170 --> 37:32.490]  Well, I'm not happy to do it, but I'm willing to do it.
[37:32.670 --> 37:34.070]  I just don't remember what it is.
[37:34.110 --> 37:36.410]  Like how I'm supposed to manipulate these stupid things.
[37:36.410 --> 37:40.530]  Eric, you're getting a nice glimpse as to what it was like to build stuff in Minecraft with Geoff.
[37:40.630 --> 37:40.890]  Insane.
[37:40.930 --> 37:43.590]  Based on his notes while he was an alcoholic.
[37:43.850 --> 37:49.930]  We would be 50% building in Minecraft and 50% trying to figure out what like double
[37:49.930 --> 37:53.630]  block upside down means and trying to make a game out of it.
[37:54.230 --> 37:58.590]  I just I just don't remember how I'm supposed to manipulate these stupid things.
[37:58.610 --> 38:00.430]  And I want to do it faithfully and properly.
[38:00.570 --> 38:01.970]  They don't say anything on them, right?
[38:01.990 --> 38:02.890]  They're just the pockets?
[38:03.110 --> 38:03.530]  Are they blank?
[38:03.830 --> 38:05.710]  I think they have the uniform logo on them.
[38:05.790 --> 38:05.990]  Okay.
[38:05.990 --> 38:09.350]  Yeah, so you're supposed to write the wrist pockets rock or whatever.
[38:09.470 --> 38:09.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:09.970 --> 38:12.650]  Whatever you wrote on your original thing that you cut out from your
[38:12.650 --> 38:14.350]  fucking jeans and just taped to your wrist.
[38:14.370 --> 38:15.770]  Oh, which I which I still have.
[38:15.850 --> 38:18.310]  It's taped to my to my monitor as reference.
[38:18.490 --> 38:19.710]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:19.710 --> 38:19.930]  Okay.
[38:20.850 --> 38:21.290]  Yeah.
[38:21.350 --> 38:23.850]  When you get 30 in and you start getting lost,
[38:24.130 --> 38:26.510]  just look back at that original that's hanging from your monitor.
[38:26.950 --> 38:27.790]  Okay, gal.
[38:28.110 --> 38:31.250]  I guess you could sign it or number them.
[38:31.330 --> 38:32.690]  You can do whatever you like.
[38:32.910 --> 38:34.990]  I had numbering sounds appropriate.
[38:34.990 --> 38:36.230]  Yeah, I mean, that sounds good.
[38:36.350 --> 38:37.950]  I mean, either way, you're writing all over them.
[38:37.950 --> 38:39.270]  So you do whatever you want, I suppose.
[38:40.030 --> 38:42.750]  Yeah, I mean, this is see, here's the thing.
[38:43.050 --> 38:43.790]  Here's the thing.
[38:44.190 --> 38:46.030]  You're saying like, oh, what am I supposed to?
[38:46.070 --> 38:47.130]  Oh, how do I get into this?
[38:47.170 --> 38:47.410]  Whatever.
[38:47.710 --> 38:51.330]  The thing that we haven't done yet that you keep talking about is hitting all
[38:51.330 --> 38:55.550]  these fucking baseballs like, well, yeah, because, uh,
[38:56.390 --> 38:57.970]  I don't know why we haven't done that yet.
[38:58.470 --> 38:59.430]  I'm ready to go.
[38:59.810 --> 39:02.350]  I got like, as soon as I'm done with quarantine, I'm ready to go.
[39:02.390 --> 39:02.610]  Yeah.
[39:02.610 --> 39:05.990]  You were supposed to throw a baseball 80 miles an hour.
[39:06.090 --> 39:08.890]  And now you're saying, why haven't I hit 1000 baseballs yet?
[39:09.890 --> 39:11.710]  Well, I think they only ordered 300.
[39:11.910 --> 39:12.890]  So I only have to hit 300.
[39:13.050 --> 39:14.570]  You're not going to hit half of them.
[39:14.790 --> 39:21.470]  Well, if I get a 50% contact ratio, that's that's got to at least be like a 300 batting average.
[39:21.610 --> 39:22.370]  I'm I'm in.
[39:22.450 --> 39:23.750]  I'm like a young Tony Gwynn.
[39:25.730 --> 39:26.310]  All right.
[39:26.350 --> 39:27.330]  We'll schedule a day.
[39:27.690 --> 39:28.450]  We'll schedule a day.
[39:28.630 --> 39:29.550]  We I have there's a field.
[39:30.050 --> 39:31.150]  There's a field we can use.
[39:31.190 --> 39:32.410]  We'll hit it into the backstop.
[39:32.410 --> 39:33.210]  We'll toss them up.
[39:33.330 --> 39:37.150]  You can hit them with do you still want to dip a bat in oil or whatever you were talking?
[39:37.350 --> 39:39.450]  Yeah, and paint and paint so that we can sign them.
[39:39.550 --> 39:40.690]  Yeah, great.
[39:40.850 --> 39:41.390]  Yeah, for sure.
[39:41.450 --> 39:41.950]  Yeah, that's cool.
[39:41.970 --> 39:43.830]  That's not going to get paints not going to go everywhere.
[39:43.930 --> 39:44.430]  This will be good.
[39:44.710 --> 39:45.930]  Oh, I assume it probably will.
[39:45.990 --> 39:46.990]  But we'll have Gavin film it.
[39:47.070 --> 39:48.670]  I know the world doesn't work this way.
[39:48.670 --> 39:52.190]  But I want the you know how like you have a Nerf gun or like a water gun, how you have
[39:52.190 --> 39:54.610]  to like pump it to increase the force on it.
[39:54.910 --> 39:58.690]  I want a bat where you have to twist the doorknob at the bottom to increase velocity.
[39:58.690 --> 40:03.030]  I just want to see you like twisting the knob, but it's like got to pump it up again.
[40:04.330 --> 40:05.630]  We'll have numbers on it.
[40:05.910 --> 40:07.870]  Let's go all the way around to 11 on the on the.
[40:08.070 --> 40:08.830]  Oh, how do you know?
[40:10.150 --> 40:12.190]  Yeah, there's like a PSI type gauge.
[40:12.830 --> 40:18.830]  I should only hit the balls with the hand with the handle bat.
[40:20.470 --> 40:23.970]  I'll have to build the handle bat prototype and then we can only hit the balls.
[40:26.770 --> 40:31.690]  Oh, man, that was the the one other thing I wanted to talk about is is this I've been
[40:31.690 --> 40:31.910]  in this.
[40:32.070 --> 40:33.990]  Well, here are you guys familiar with this?
[40:34.310 --> 40:36.990]  Liquid Death is fixing the big game using witchcraft.
[40:37.150 --> 40:38.150]  Should I be watching this?
[40:38.490 --> 40:44.290]  Liquid Death, which is like a water company, has enlisted the help as a marketing campaign
[40:44.290 --> 40:52.310]  enlisted the help of a magician or I don't know, a brewery or wizard or somebody to use
[40:52.310 --> 40:55.990]  magic to determine and influence the outcome of the Super Bowl.
[40:56.070 --> 40:58.050]  I'll say from my experience, it was not helpful.
[40:58.910 --> 40:59.850]  Not the magic.
[41:00.230 --> 41:01.190]  Are you guys done with magic?
[41:01.390 --> 41:06.750]  Well, I think in like a week there will be it will be announced who the offensive rookie
[41:06.750 --> 41:08.050]  of the year is a week for us.
[41:08.150 --> 41:10.490]  It'll probably be out by the time you hear this.
[41:10.710 --> 41:11.550]  Yeah, I'm assuming.
[41:11.910 --> 41:13.170]  But we'll find that out.
[41:13.210 --> 41:18.010]  And from my understanding, the list included Geoff's rookie and Gavin's rookie, but not
[41:18.010 --> 41:19.770]  my rookie didn't even make the cut.
[41:19.770 --> 41:20.970]  And then McCorkle.
[41:21.930 --> 41:28.670]  Fortunately, Justin Fields, no matter what witchcraft or wizardry I threw at Justin
[41:28.670 --> 41:32.870]  Fields, nothing could overcome the dark forces of Matt Nagy, which held us back.
[41:32.990 --> 41:35.110]  But I'm hoping for one of you to.
[41:35.310 --> 41:36.690]  What kind of spells were you doing?
[41:37.170 --> 41:40.490]  All sorts of I'm it's not that's beyond my understanding.
[41:40.690 --> 41:45.270]  I just had I think the problem is you were you were soliciting help from people.
[41:45.490 --> 41:48.970]  I just did the actual spells and incantations myself.
[41:48.970 --> 41:50.670]  That might be the thing I need to change.
[41:50.770 --> 41:52.450]  The only person I don't want to win is Gavin.
[41:52.690 --> 41:55.290]  Yeah, because you did nothing.
[41:55.470 --> 41:57.390]  You did nothing and you made fun of it.
[41:57.470 --> 41:59.190]  The entire process of doing it.
[41:59.390 --> 42:05.230]  I would be the most you think I'm just putting up and it's not it's a shame because I like
[42:05.230 --> 42:05.690]  their water.
[42:06.170 --> 42:10.210]  I do think it's actually pretty good, but I'm just putting up just throwing out there
[42:10.210 --> 42:15.470]  that if we're going to use magic again in the future to influence the outcome of anything,
[42:15.590 --> 42:18.230]  which I think we should, because I think we still have our wizards versus magic
[42:18.230 --> 42:19.990]  idea for basketball.
[42:20.390 --> 42:25.470]  And I do think that there's more room to grow in the using magic to influence sporting events
[42:25.470 --> 42:26.170]  angle.
[42:26.330 --> 42:29.230]  I think we kind of lost lost the thread a little bit as we got distracted by other
[42:29.230 --> 42:30.030]  things on the podcast.
[42:30.450 --> 42:34.290]  I would like to revisit it sometime, but I would also like to raise the idea that if
[42:34.290 --> 42:38.310]  we're going to use magic to influence anything, maybe it should be to get revenge on liquid
[42:38.310 --> 42:38.750]  death.
[42:39.110 --> 42:41.410]  Like use magic to combat their magic.
[42:41.830 --> 42:44.650]  Yeah, to like, yeah, I don't know what to figure it out.
[42:44.810 --> 42:45.430]  Maybe hex them.
[42:45.430 --> 42:49.030]  I was looking at the Super Bowl halftime prop bets for this year.
[42:49.110 --> 42:50.490]  I'd like to throw some magic at that.
[42:50.890 --> 42:51.730]  I'm really I'm trying.
[42:51.810 --> 42:55.690]  I've been spending the last day trying to decide what color of Gatorade the winning coach is
[42:55.690 --> 42:56.630]  going to get dumped over him.
[42:56.910 --> 42:58.350]  It's two to one odds on orange.
[42:58.430 --> 42:59.070]  Just the favorite.
[42:59.270 --> 43:00.170]  But it's it's a tough.
[43:00.370 --> 43:03.710]  Hey, if you I know you're probably doing your prop bets from your phone, but I'm going to
[43:03.710 --> 43:05.250]  be in Vegas for the Super Bowl.
[43:05.450 --> 43:08.550]  So if you want me to place any bets physically while I'm there, I'll be happy.
[43:08.590 --> 43:09.730]  Let me know what they have.
[43:09.770 --> 43:10.530]  I'd love to hear.
[43:10.770 --> 43:14.250]  It's probably a more extensive because it's like I'm going to once again, I think the
[43:14.250 --> 43:16.990]  greatest win I've ever had in my career of gambling.
[43:17.270 --> 43:18.590]  It's so dumb to call it a career.
[43:18.690 --> 43:19.410]  I don't know why I said that.
[43:19.650 --> 43:25.170]  But the J-Lo picking what song J-Lo would open with when she was at the Super Bowl.
[43:25.430 --> 43:27.150]  Is that leak all time win?
[43:27.450 --> 43:29.350]  The excitement of hearing Jenny from the blocks.
[43:29.410 --> 43:32.490]  I'm hoping to recreate that great halftime show this year.
[43:32.570 --> 43:33.150]  Very excited.
[43:33.350 --> 43:34.290]  Very excited as well.
[43:34.570 --> 43:35.210]  Yeah, let me know.
[43:35.330 --> 43:36.510]  I mean, this will come out.
[43:36.950 --> 43:38.050]  This will already see.
[43:38.070 --> 43:39.050]  Yeah, it'll all be done.
[43:39.390 --> 43:40.830]  OK, so I'm staying at the wind.
[43:40.910 --> 43:42.990]  So I'll be at the sportsbook in the wind watching the Super Bowl.
[43:42.990 --> 43:45.710]  I'll send you photos of all the profits.
[43:45.730 --> 43:46.190]  Thank you.
[43:46.250 --> 43:46.450]  Awesome.
[43:46.670 --> 43:50.030]  Very, very fun because it's the main one I got to pick is like who will sing first,
[43:50.090 --> 43:50.670]  which I don't know.
[43:50.810 --> 43:53.190]  I don't know who will perform first over unders on the anthem.
[43:53.730 --> 43:56.070]  Who will the MVP mentioned first?
[43:56.150 --> 43:57.350]  Just a bunch of ridiculous ones.
[43:57.350 --> 44:02.190]  But I'd love I bet you this actual sportsbook has way more dumb options to pick from.
[44:02.470 --> 44:02.810]  Absolutely.
[44:03.270 --> 44:04.170]  OK, that was my things.
[44:04.270 --> 44:04.930]  I have one thing.
[44:04.970 --> 44:07.550]  It's a very uneventful week for me.
[44:07.610 --> 44:12.910]  Aside from something happened that I feel like I'm almost confident in saying,
[44:12.910 --> 44:14.730]  this has never happened to anyone else on Earth.
[44:16.870 --> 44:19.270]  OK, there's some pictures, some pictures coming.
[44:19.590 --> 44:20.910]  Oh, I'm very excited.
[44:21.030 --> 44:25.610]  So I was putting some stuff on my wall, putting some controllers up because I feel I've got
[44:25.610 --> 44:26.110]  some nicer.
[44:26.650 --> 44:27.310]  Yeah, those are pretty.
[44:27.590 --> 44:28.290]  Jeremy does this, too.
[44:28.350 --> 44:31.890]  He's got like some nice limited edition controllers that aren't necessarily in use because they're
[44:31.890 --> 44:32.530]  not elite or whatever.
[44:32.670 --> 44:34.290]  So display them on the wall.
[44:34.410 --> 44:41.990]  And then I was wearing some sweatpants that have these little toggle things that cover the end of,
[44:41.990 --> 44:43.490]  you know, like cover like the plastic bit.
[44:43.850 --> 44:43.890]  Yeah.
[44:44.050 --> 44:46.350]  Plastic cap for the end of your sweatpants.
[44:46.410 --> 44:48.330]  It's wearing these sweatpants, putting these things on the wall.
[44:48.890 --> 44:50.890]  Smee was like swatting at the strings.
[44:51.210 --> 44:54.610]  And I guess at some point he knocked one of them off.
[44:54.690 --> 44:59.730]  And down here you can see they look very similar to like the drywall anchors.
[45:00.070 --> 45:01.690]  Oh my God.
[45:01.970 --> 45:04.730]  So I posted one of those into my wall.
[45:04.850 --> 45:07.230]  I'm not sure anyone ever has ever done that.
[45:07.230 --> 45:14.990]  Do you think anyone has accidentally pushed the cover from their sweatpants toggle into a hole
[45:14.990 --> 45:16.330]  they drilled in their own wall?
[45:16.750 --> 45:20.550]  Because I, and he looked at, Smee looked at me after I did this, after I realized that it went
[45:20.550 --> 45:22.850]  straight in instead of, you know, stopping in the wall.
[45:22.970 --> 45:23.990]  It just went whoop.
[45:24.070 --> 45:26.690]  And I heard it just rattled down and fall into the floor of the wall.
[45:27.050 --> 45:28.790]  And then he just looked at me like he meant to do it.
[45:28.930 --> 45:30.090]  That's probably why you lost power.
[45:31.310 --> 45:33.950]  At that point I just thought, has that, has that ever happened?
[45:34.050 --> 45:35.870]  No, you're the only person.
[45:35.870 --> 45:37.910]  Like no one would come up with that, would they?
[45:38.130 --> 45:39.010]  How old is earth?
[45:39.150 --> 45:39.730]  Hold on.
[45:41.530 --> 45:44.810]  I was like, of all the things in the correct order to happen,
[45:44.910 --> 45:46.930]  they look similar, they're the similar size.
[45:47.290 --> 45:55.570]  In 4.543 billion years, you are the only person to have done that.
[45:55.690 --> 45:58.130]  I would, I would bet my life on it.
[46:01.920 --> 46:05.120]  I, I wish I was just filming the, my own face.
[46:05.120 --> 46:07.460]  Just as a realization, it was like, oh.
[46:07.860 --> 46:11.400]  I'm really loving these little peeks into your, your home life lately.
[46:11.600 --> 46:12.940]  It's been highly entertaining.
[46:13.960 --> 46:15.700]  It's just, nothing normal ever happens.
[46:15.880 --> 46:18.500]  I, I want a normal experience for once.
[46:18.900 --> 46:21.940]  I, I'm trying to get more into DIY and it's a disaster.
[46:22.120 --> 46:26.860]  And it's not like I'm being lazy or, I just can't, this weird shit keeps happening.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.960]  The unknown, it's never in the instructions.
[46:30.980 --> 46:34.340]  Well, yeah, I guess there's probably not a thing in your, your door,
[46:34.340 --> 46:36.180]  your doorknob for explosions.
[46:36.480 --> 46:37.780]  I bet that wasn't a covered section.
[46:38.220 --> 46:38.840]  No. What else?
[46:39.320 --> 46:41.440]  I mean, is there anything, are those the two main things?
[46:41.940 --> 46:44.800]  I mean, am I missing anything of like DIY gone wrong for you recently?
[46:45.240 --> 46:45.680]  Trying to remember.
[46:45.960 --> 46:49.840]  Because you had the, the wasp nest in your fan, but that wasn't really your fault.
[46:49.880 --> 46:51.640]  Or like a design thing by you.
[46:51.820 --> 46:53.500]  Well, he blew up his door handle.
[46:53.980 --> 46:55.820]  He snatched, snatched his remote in half.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.880]  He didn't vacuum for a year and a half till we made him do it on camera.
[47:00.020 --> 47:01.300]  Well, I vacuumed the carpet.
[47:01.400 --> 47:04.240]  I just didn't vacuum the, the sideboard.
[47:04.340 --> 47:05.760]  The cucumber incident.
[47:07.120 --> 47:10.840]  He threw, he threw a Route 44 across his house trying to repaint it.
[47:10.860 --> 47:12.220]  Those are great. Those are highlights.
[47:12.480 --> 47:14.560]  Those are great things that happened in the house.
[47:15.640 --> 47:19.100]  What's the most ambitious DIY project you've taken on?
[47:19.400 --> 47:20.660]  Is this it? You'd say?
[47:20.920 --> 47:21.960]  Yeah, it's pretty simple stuff.
[47:22.120 --> 47:23.200]  I've done some like wiring.
[47:23.560 --> 47:25.440]  I drop shit in my walls a lot, I'll be honest.
[47:25.620 --> 47:28.320]  I'm not used to having like big hollow walls with nothing in between.
[47:28.860 --> 47:33.760]  That I had this, this thing that you could tie around the end of a wire.
[47:33.760 --> 47:34.580]  It was like a magnet.
[47:35.020 --> 47:37.000]  On the outside of the wall, you have like a magnetic roller.
[47:37.280 --> 47:41.280]  So you roll it up the wall and it sort of drags wires up or down the inside of your walls.
[47:41.860 --> 47:45.360]  But I guess I was just unaware of where other wires are in the wall.
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.460]  Like to an outlet, there's wires going down the wall and then like coming out sideways.
[47:49.620 --> 47:52.940]  And I ended up tangling this freaking magnet thing.
[47:53.120 --> 47:55.440]  And to the point where there's still one inside my wall.
[47:55.500 --> 47:57.540]  And I just sealed the hole up because I couldn't get it out.
[47:57.900 --> 47:59.460]  It's like there's in one of my walls,
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.200]  there's a load of string with a magnet on the end wrapped around the wire
[48:03.200 --> 48:05.180]  that feeds the outlet by that.
[48:06.520 --> 48:08.140]  And it's just going to be in there forever.
[48:08.780 --> 48:14.400]  Like the next door to the house is going to find a lot of weird shit in the walls, I think.
[48:14.960 --> 48:16.420]  Based on how it's gone so far.
[48:17.140 --> 48:21.680]  It's like all those old American houses with like loose razor blades in the bathroom walls.
[48:21.920 --> 48:22.360]  Oh yeah.
[48:22.520 --> 48:24.540]  Oh no, that sounds terrible.
[48:24.800 --> 48:25.820]  You don't know about that, Andrew?
[48:25.980 --> 48:27.320]  No, I've never heard of that.
[48:27.420 --> 48:30.640]  Yeah, in old bathrooms, they used to do that in an old medicine cabinet.
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.360]  Sometimes there'd be like a little razor thing where you just like pop your razor in and just
[48:34.360 --> 48:35.560]  go into the wall forever.
[48:35.580 --> 48:38.380]  It's like the most short-sighted thing ever.
[48:38.580 --> 48:41.720]  It's like, it was like a staple inside of medicine cabinets.
[48:41.840 --> 48:46.440]  There would just be a little slit for you to just throw shit away inside your wall.
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.740]  Back in the old days, though, I think like this is that shit was probably made like in the 1930s,
[48:51.740 --> 48:52.420]  1940s.
[48:52.700 --> 48:55.560]  I think razor blades lasted a whole lot longer back then.
[48:55.640 --> 48:57.500]  They were made to be more durable.
[48:57.660 --> 48:59.840]  So you probably weren't popping one a week in there.
[48:59.840 --> 49:02.120]  It was probably more like one every six months or something.
[49:02.320 --> 49:03.620]  Oh, I thought it was like a weekly thing.
[49:03.960 --> 49:09.100]  No, razor blades are that's it's it's one of those scams like light bulbs where razor blades
[49:09.100 --> 49:13.460]  are made to deteriorate and suck so that they are so that they're infinitely replaceable so
[49:13.460 --> 49:14.360]  they can sell it to you forever.
[49:14.920 --> 49:16.840]  But you can make a razor blade that lasts damn near forever.
[49:17.060 --> 49:19.580]  I want to know the history of that, though, because what is it?
[49:19.660 --> 49:21.380]  Just look it up on Google.
[49:21.480 --> 49:22.400]  They got it all.
[49:22.660 --> 49:24.360]  Anything you want to know the history on, Google got it.
[49:24.420 --> 49:24.740]  Do they?
[49:25.120 --> 49:25.480]  Yeah.
[49:25.760 --> 49:28.020]  I just want to like, what was the conversation of?
[49:28.020 --> 49:30.080]  Did somebody say, well, then where do those go?
[49:30.320 --> 49:31.660]  And then just like, I don't know.
[49:31.700 --> 49:32.240]  But who cares?
[49:32.520 --> 49:33.120]  Yeah, there you go.
[49:33.180 --> 49:33.800]  A razor blade slot.
[49:34.040 --> 49:35.380]  Razor blade slot.
[49:35.700 --> 49:38.440]  Because they're sharp and dangerous and you don't want to throw them in a trash can and
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.860]  then pick it up and get you cut yourself.
[49:40.020 --> 49:41.040]  Oh, that's fucking.
[49:41.200 --> 49:43.900]  There's another photo of is this the remains of?
[49:44.260 --> 49:48.500]  Yeah, that's what happens if you cut open like a certain aged American home.
[49:49.220 --> 49:55.680]  I really like the idea of like a generation of people having their pile excess like this
[49:55.680 --> 49:57.280]  is great grandpappy's razor.
[49:57.280 --> 50:02.260]  It's like when the people like call the ice and you could say this is six million years old.
[50:02.540 --> 50:04.780]  That's like, well, that's so granddad's razors.
[50:05.020 --> 50:09.540]  So in the 1930s, the worst wall to get thrown through would be a bathroom wall.
[50:09.680 --> 50:13.840]  If you're going to go through a wall, that would be the worst one.
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.300]  Like that scene in the Matrix, where they're in the wet world.
[50:17.120 --> 50:19.600]  That's like a shitload of razor blades, cut them up.
[50:19.660 --> 50:25.220]  I would, I'd be so pissed if I got thrown through a wall and landed on a razor pile.
[50:27.720 --> 50:31.520]  If I was fighting somebody, let's say I'm in a fight to the death, right?
[50:31.580 --> 50:34.240]  I'm having a full on brawl with somebody in a bathroom.
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.900]  If I threw them through the wall and they got they landed on a razor pile,
[50:38.980 --> 50:42.440]  I would call a timeout on their behalf because that's just unacceptable.
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.360]  I would feel so bad that would end the fight.
[50:46.180 --> 50:47.460]  Gotta call it a doctor.
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.100]  I'd throw in the bathroom towel just to end it immediately.
[50:52.320 --> 50:53.240]  This cannot continue.
[50:53.500 --> 50:55.880]  Did you ever live in a house, Geoff, that had one of those?
[50:56.020 --> 50:56.980]  I assume so.
[50:56.980 --> 51:01.760]  I mean, I want to say maybe the old house that we lived in together
[51:01.760 --> 51:06.020]  in the downstairs bathroom might have had it, but I can't remember specifically.
[51:06.460 --> 51:08.360]  But I mean, it's something that like the second you mentioned it,
[51:08.400 --> 51:09.560]  it's so commonplace in my head.
[51:09.640 --> 51:10.840]  I feel like I see it all the time.
[51:11.300 --> 51:16.360]  I would go so far as to say any house that's 80 years old or older,
[51:16.540 --> 51:19.120]  probably that hasn't been completely renovated, probably has one of these.
[51:19.340 --> 51:24.280]  You might be living in a home, you dear regulation listener or comment leaver,
[51:24.680 --> 51:29.260]  you might be living in a home right now with a hidden cache of razor blades
[51:29.260 --> 51:30.540]  that you have no idea about.
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.780]  Go check out your bathroom and look at it with a critical eye.
[51:33.020 --> 51:37.560]  Back when I had a yard, I used to think about what is the coolest thing buried in that yard
[51:37.560 --> 51:38.980]  that I just have no idea is there.
[51:39.180 --> 51:41.760]  If there's anything like if I were to dig up the entire yard,
[51:41.860 --> 51:43.940]  how far would I have to go before I found something?
[51:44.340 --> 51:45.460]  And what would that thing be?
[51:45.480 --> 51:46.920]  Are you just talking straight down?
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.660]  Like I'm talking straight down on my...
[51:49.660 --> 51:51.260]  If I just got a shovel and was like,
[51:51.260 --> 51:54.000]  I'm going to spend the next 15 years, whatever I feel like it,
[51:54.060 --> 51:55.780]  just digging holes in my backyard.
[51:56.060 --> 51:57.400]  I mean, what's the coolest thing?
[51:57.420 --> 51:59.040]  More likely than not, you'll probably find nothing, right?
[51:59.260 --> 52:00.160]  I'd assume so.
[52:00.480 --> 52:00.820]  No, I don't know.
[52:00.820 --> 52:01.760]  It's just a possibility.
[52:02.260 --> 52:03.980]  My backyard is full of shit.
[52:04.080 --> 52:04.340]  Really?
[52:04.560 --> 52:04.780]  Huh?
[52:04.880 --> 52:10.220]  Yeah, like I don't know who the motherfuckers were that lived in this house 40 years ago,
[52:10.220 --> 52:13.100]  but they were straight up burying trash in the backyard.
[52:13.480 --> 52:13.700]  Huh?
[52:15.400 --> 52:17.320]  Have you... what's the coolest thing you found?
[52:17.560 --> 52:18.280]  Nothing cool.
[52:18.440 --> 52:19.280]  Nothing cool at all.
[52:19.280 --> 52:22.460]  But like digging to fucking like put a flower bed in or something,
[52:22.560 --> 52:25.980]  you're like, why is there half a milk jug buried below?
[52:26.500 --> 52:27.480]  What the fuck?
[52:27.900 --> 52:30.060]  And I'm constantly picking up like...
[52:30.060 --> 52:31.380]  I think they were kind of like...
[52:31.380 --> 52:34.980]  Austin has this eclectic vibe, Andrew.
[52:36.120 --> 52:41.060]  It's maybe not as prevalent as it was with the influx of money and tech bros and stuff.
[52:41.240 --> 52:43.840]  But Austin used to pride itself on like every, you know,
[52:43.900 --> 52:48.700]  everybody's backyard was like full of Christmas lights 24 hours a day or 365 days a year.
[52:48.700 --> 52:51.980]  And you would have like these little weird gardens of like found shit
[52:51.980 --> 52:53.880]  and like a lot of old wrought iron rusting.
[52:54.040 --> 52:54.520]  It's all cute.
[52:54.620 --> 52:57.160]  There's like coffee shops like Spider House, which is closed now,
[52:57.240 --> 52:58.740]  but kind of pride themselves on it.
[52:58.780 --> 52:59.500]  It's like, it's weird.
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.240]  It's like being in a salvage yard that's a coffee shop.
[53:01.380 --> 53:02.000]  I didn't know it closed.
[53:02.280 --> 53:03.020]  Yeah, it did.
[53:03.240 --> 53:06.000]  The place next door to it that they operate is still open,
[53:06.080 --> 53:07.720]  the ballroom, but the coffee shop's closed.
[53:07.820 --> 53:08.100]  Real sad.
[53:08.840 --> 53:10.200]  So the people...
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.700]  There were definitely some like hippie-ish people who lived in my yard,
[53:13.780 --> 53:16.700]  my house at some point who would just bury like,
[53:17.020 --> 53:17.940]  you know, there's like glass,
[53:17.940 --> 53:19.540]  anything they had, they were like,
[53:19.820 --> 53:23.580]  throw it in the backyard and it will make it, it'll be a thing.
[53:23.720 --> 53:27.200]  Like I was cleaning up in the extreme back of my yard.
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.080]  I was just cleaning up piles of leaves.
[53:29.200 --> 53:32.100]  And I like, I touched on something that was like hard.
[53:32.200 --> 53:34.840]  So I dug it out and it was like a ceramic tile.
[53:35.040 --> 53:36.880]  And I thought, what a weird thing to be in the ground.
[53:37.020 --> 53:39.440]  And then I noticed there was, it was budding up next to another one.
[53:39.480 --> 53:41.780]  And I pulled up 25 ceramic tiles.
[53:42.100 --> 53:44.280]  Somebody just laid them in a pattern and said like,
[53:44.560 --> 53:46.080]  hey, it's a back deck now.
[53:46.080 --> 53:49.140]  I put 25 ceramic tiles on top of the ground.
[53:49.380 --> 53:50.120]  It's a deck.
[53:50.380 --> 53:53.280]  And then eventually dirt and age covered it.
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.840]  My backyard is full of that shit.
[53:55.980 --> 53:58.000]  I'll just be like, I'll kick the ground and it'll hurt.
[53:58.120 --> 53:58.780]  And I'll be like, what the fuck?
[53:58.800 --> 53:59.580]  And I'll dig out a brick.
[54:00.040 --> 54:01.660]  Like no reason, middle of the yard.
[54:01.700 --> 54:03.960]  Maybe if we go to your yard to dig the bean hole,
[54:04.040 --> 54:05.300]  we'll find some really cool shit.
[54:05.600 --> 54:07.780]  Can we make a fucking bean hole finally?
[54:07.900 --> 54:08.580]  Let's finally do it.
[54:08.760 --> 54:09.260]  Let's finally do it.
[54:09.460 --> 54:12.360]  2022 is the year of the bean hole.
[54:12.640 --> 54:14.920]  This idea predates f***face all together.
[54:15.000 --> 54:15.780]  Do you want to explain it, Geoff?
[54:15.780 --> 54:20.540]  Yeah, I got really into bean holes a couple of years ago,
[54:20.540 --> 54:22.440]  over a decade ago at this point,
[54:22.440 --> 54:25.020]  because I read an article in the New York Times about it.
[54:25.280 --> 54:29.660]  And what it is, Andrew, is it was started by loggers up in the northeast,
[54:29.760 --> 54:31.420]  like in the main Vermont area.
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.200]  What they would do is they had to feed all the loggers
[54:35.200 --> 54:38.020]  and they were moving campsites like every two days,
[54:38.060 --> 54:40.240]  going further and further up into the extreme north.
[54:40.400 --> 54:44.940]  And so the chef, the cook would have to travel ahead of them
[54:44.940 --> 54:47.780]  and prepare food and have the food ready for them when they got there.
[54:47.920 --> 54:50.160]  So they developed this ingenious idea
[54:50.160 --> 54:52.840]  where they would dig a hole in the ground, right?
[54:53.180 --> 54:55.980]  And then they would take a big-ass, like, cast iron pot
[54:55.980 --> 54:59.760]  and they would fill it with beans and then like a ham hock
[54:59.760 --> 55:03.280]  and tomatoes and onions and just everything you would want
[55:03.280 --> 55:05.400]  in like some yummy-ass baked beans, right?
[55:05.800 --> 55:06.580]  This crazy recipe.
[55:06.900 --> 55:09.080]  And then they would close it up, right?
[55:09.220 --> 55:11.720]  Put the top on the big cast iron, stick it in the hole,
[55:12.040 --> 55:13.200]  about four feet in the ground, maybe.
[55:13.200 --> 55:16.280]  And then they would burn a bunch of wood
[55:16.280 --> 55:19.600]  and then they would get all the hot, essentially the hot coals
[55:19.600 --> 55:21.460]  and they would cover the bean hole
[55:21.460 --> 55:24.460]  or they would cover the cast iron bean container
[55:24.460 --> 55:26.020]  with all these hot embers, right?
[55:26.160 --> 55:29.100]  And then they would stick like a piece of plywood over that
[55:29.100 --> 55:31.040]  and then cover it with like a foot of dirt.
[55:31.480 --> 55:35.940]  And then 48 hours later, when the loggers would come up,
[55:36.180 --> 55:38.560]  they would knock off the dirt, pick up the thing,
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.580]  pull out the bean hole and they would have
[55:40.580 --> 55:44.040]  the greatest tasting beans on earth in this giant pot
[55:44.040 --> 55:46.140]  that they could all eat communally for like two days.
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.800]  And then at that point, then the chef would go up two days further
[55:50.800 --> 55:51.940]  and then make another bean hole.
[55:52.180 --> 55:57.220]  And so from everything that I've read in my extensive bean hole research,
[55:57.400 --> 56:00.940]  there is nothing on earth like bean hole beans.
[56:01.240 --> 56:06.180]  There is nothing on earth like 48 hour prepared bean hole beans.
[56:06.700 --> 56:09.840]  And when I was in the army and we fought forest fires in Montana,
[56:09.840 --> 56:14.200]  one of the things that they did was they would give us these solar lunch bags
[56:14.200 --> 56:18.180]  that would have like a burrito in it and it would be wrapped in tinfoil.
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.900]  And the instructions were to find some hot ash on the ground that had burned
[56:22.900 --> 56:26.340]  and then kick a hole, stick it in and then cover with the ashes
[56:26.340 --> 56:28.300]  and come back in like 20 minutes and you'd have a cooked burrito.
[56:28.640 --> 56:30.540]  And ever since then, I thought that was the coolest idea.
[56:31.200 --> 56:32.460]  It's like the nature's microwave.
[56:32.800 --> 56:33.520]  Yeah, nature's microwave.
[56:33.600 --> 56:34.660]  So when I discovered the bean hole,
[56:34.820 --> 56:37.840]  I've been obsessed with the idea of making a bean hole forever
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.480]  and we've been talking about it forever.
[56:39.480 --> 56:41.920]  And I really want to do it. I just haven't done it.
[56:42.040 --> 56:43.640]  Yeah, you absolutely need to do that.
[56:43.740 --> 56:46.260]  I explained this whole thing to Eric Barr recently.
[56:46.460 --> 56:46.900]  Oh, did you?
[56:47.100 --> 56:50.400]  Yeah, I would like to think that the inventor of the bean hole
[56:50.400 --> 56:52.320]  also invented the razor blade slot.
[56:52.460 --> 56:55.020]  Like the concept of like this is his follow up.
[56:55.200 --> 56:56.440]  Like you brought on Shark Tank.
[56:56.560 --> 56:59.840]  Let me everybody knows the success I've had with the razor blade slot.
[56:59.920 --> 57:01.080]  I got the newest innovation.
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.720]  OK, we're not done putting things in a hole
[57:04.720 --> 57:06.720]  and then just forgetting about them for a while.
[57:07.120 --> 57:08.420]  This is the bean hole.
[57:08.420 --> 57:11.640]  You will never have beans better than when you put them in a hole.
[57:11.860 --> 57:14.720]  Do yourself a favor and after this episode's over,
[57:14.800 --> 57:16.300]  at some point throughout the course of your day,
[57:16.380 --> 57:18.280]  when you're not watching the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,
[57:18.360 --> 57:20.420]  which you absolutely should be doing, but I know you're not going to do.
[57:20.580 --> 57:24.000]  Oh, you fucking pretzeled me so hard with the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.260]  I'm just telling you, I just know you.
[57:26.400 --> 57:27.720]  I know you. You're not going to fucking do it.
[57:27.740 --> 57:28.280]  So it doesn't matter.
[57:28.440 --> 57:28.600]  You pretzeled me.
[57:29.800 --> 57:34.380]  Don't give me the pleasantries of maybe I'll check it out someday bullshit.
[57:34.500 --> 57:37.440]  Just be honest and tell me you're never going to watch a show that I recommend.
[57:37.880 --> 57:39.060]  That I want you to.
[57:39.420 --> 57:40.420]  Anyway, I don't know what to do.
[57:40.460 --> 57:42.600]  While you're not watching the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,
[57:42.720 --> 57:46.860]  what I would like you to do at some point is watch any video on bean holes on YouTube.
[57:46.860 --> 57:47.060]  I will.
[57:47.400 --> 57:48.680]  It'll blow your fucking mind.
[57:49.040 --> 57:50.220]  There's a ton of good ones.
[57:50.380 --> 57:51.220]  Should we do it this month?
[57:51.380 --> 57:52.020]  No, it's too cold.
[57:52.180 --> 57:53.780]  It'll be like summer again by the end of the week.
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.680]  Well, Eric says June.
[57:55.900 --> 57:56.920]  Let's plan for March.
[57:57.440 --> 57:58.620]  March is good bean hole month.
[57:58.780 --> 57:59.900]  I have another update.
[58:00.200 --> 58:01.380]  Another small update that I want to say.
[58:01.620 --> 58:05.000]  A lot of people telling me I'm an idiot for putting the fingerprint door handle.
[58:05.060 --> 58:07.120]  I could have just turned my door handle upside down.
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.180]  My door handles already work both ways.
[58:10.320 --> 58:14.280]  I'm not sure if that's a variation, but I can turn my handles up to open the door as well.
[58:14.440 --> 58:15.840]  So I'm not flipping upside down.
[58:15.900 --> 58:16.740]  I don't think would do anything.
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.520]  Moneybags over here with the ambidextrous door handles.
[58:19.780 --> 58:20.140]  Look at you.
[58:20.320 --> 58:20.880]  High class.
[58:21.060 --> 58:22.760]  I mean, they were on the doors already when I moved.
[58:22.960 --> 58:23.140]  But sure.
[58:23.380 --> 58:27.360]  Very, very, very, very subtle brag, Gavin.
[58:27.440 --> 58:28.540]  But we all got it.
[58:28.660 --> 58:29.060]  Uh-huh.
[58:30.580 --> 58:32.760]  Look at this guy over here.
[58:32.800 --> 58:35.660]  Message received loud and clear.
[58:35.660 --> 58:38.160]  Message received, we understand.
[58:38.780 --> 58:40.020]  Which ways do your doors go?
[58:40.340 --> 58:40.640]  Just one?
[58:40.680 --> 58:42.100]  I have knobs, baby.
[58:42.380 --> 58:42.880]  Knobs everywhere?
[58:43.600 --> 58:46.600]  My front door is a push down with my thumb.
[58:46.900 --> 58:50.380]  My other final update is that, um...
[58:50.380 --> 58:52.620]  Geoff, what's the name of the dwarf in Lord of the Rings?
[58:52.980 --> 58:53.220]  Gimli?
[58:54.240 --> 58:56.740]  Right? Gimli?
[58:56.980 --> 58:57.880]  Yeah. Andrew, what did you think?
[58:57.880 --> 58:59.960]  Listen, listen, okay?
[59:00.840 --> 59:03.420]  I, first of all, I got it wrong.
[59:03.420 --> 59:07.700]  Second of all, I'm trying to crawl to my door to see if my door handle twists both ways.
[59:07.980 --> 59:09.080]  I thought it was Grimly.
[59:09.500 --> 59:12.960]  I've spent my whole life thinking the dwarf from Lord of the Rings is called Grimly.
[59:13.100 --> 59:13.680]  That's a cool name, though.
[59:13.680 --> 59:18.060]  I just like the idea of Gimli, son of Gloin, being Grimly, son of Groin.
[59:20.860 --> 59:22.380]  Oh, this fucking door doesn't...
[59:22.380 --> 59:24.540]  Let me slide to the other part of my room.
[59:25.040 --> 59:26.600]  We're going on a little adventure.
[59:27.160 --> 59:27.720]  Be careful.
[59:28.140 --> 59:28.820]  You could hurt yourself.
[59:29.220 --> 59:30.180]  Please, don't hurt yourself.
[59:30.360 --> 59:31.800]  No, I'm just dragging everything.
[59:32.720 --> 59:33.500]  That's all over.
[59:33.800 --> 59:36.740]  Okay, we're not going to end it while Andrew's crawling across his room.
[59:36.980 --> 59:39.080]  Holy shit, I think my doors go both ways.
[59:39.360 --> 59:40.260]  My doors go both ways.
[59:40.400 --> 59:43.420]  I wasn't going to say anything about this, but fuck it.
[59:43.480 --> 59:45.680]  I'm going to tease it because it'll annoy you guys.
[59:46.060 --> 59:51.680]  I was thinking about both of your lives recently and about their particular frustrations
[59:51.680 --> 59:54.740]  that you deal with on a day-to-day basis.
[59:55.480 --> 59:57.720]  And I felt bad about it.
[59:57.760 --> 59:59.580]  And I thought, as a good friend,
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.620]  I'm going to think about your problems and I'm going to figure out ways to solve them.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.240]  And then I went out and I did that and I bought some stuff for you guys
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.640]  that I think is going to help make your lives easier a little bit.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.940]  And so, Gavin, I have yours in my...
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.220]  I'm looking at it, but I can't give it to you yet because Andrew's doesn't arrive
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.480]  until, I believe, February 16th.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.960]  So on February 16th, I'm going to drive your gift over to you
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.300]  and then you guys can have them on the same day and then we can talk about it on the podcast.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.040]  But I want to let you guys know, help is coming on February 16th.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.060]  Your lives will get a little bit easier.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.680]  Both of you.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:33.420]  Interesting.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.600]  It's so funny you say this.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.580]  Did you know that Amazon doesn't sell dildos anymore?
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:44.540]  I'm assuming they stopped relatively recently because I was going to do the same for you,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.180]  Geoff, because you had COVID and you've been quarantining.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:48.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.240]  As a good friend, I should send you a box of goodies just to make it through,
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.340]  to have a good time with.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.820]  But they stopped, they don't sell dildos on Amazon.com. Couldn't find one.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.900]  Well, that's a shame.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:00.680]  It is a shame.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.760]  It was in reference to Geoff once mailed me a capture card for like work stuff.
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.000]  Like a work order, like years ago.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:08.860]  Yeah, nice guy.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.000]  And you were going to mail me a dildo, but decided against it at the last minute as a joke.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.380]  So I was going to send you a dildo, but I couldn't find one on Amazon.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.680]  If you send it to me, if you find a dildo and send it to me, I will put a handle on it.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:32.020]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the Hanky Danky Bob Vila Old Man Podcast.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.740]  We really appreciate it. Like and subscribe.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.240]  Is that a thing? I don't know.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.400]  We do have a YouTube channel, though.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.620]  But we also have a podcast and that's what you're listening to.
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:41.460]  And that's what this was.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.560]  And now it's over. Bye.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.400]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.200]  That question is too bread.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.000]  Andrew pulled an all-nighter.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.680]  Gavin's eyes are messed up.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.280]  The boys are up early.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.400]  Geoff talks about hitting baseballs.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.300]  Bananas can save your life.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.260]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.420]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
