[00:32.730 --> 00:35.710]  Dude, I fuck the Sacramento Kings, Orlando Magic.
[00:35.870 --> 00:36.390]  I don't get it.
[00:36.630 --> 00:37.850]  What about the Coyotes?
[00:38.250 --> 00:41.870]  The Coyotes are moving to a stadium that seats 3000 people.
[00:42.330 --> 00:44.230]  No. Are you serious?
[00:44.770 --> 00:45.850]  Yes, because they got kicked.
[00:45.950 --> 00:48.350]  They forgot to pay rent on their current stadium.
[00:48.750 --> 00:49.910]  And then they paid it.
[00:49.990 --> 00:51.770]  They're like, oh, it was a mistake. We just forgot.
[00:51.910 --> 00:53.610]  They're like, no, you fucking for how this works.
[00:53.610 --> 00:55.390]  You guys just decided not to pay it.
[00:55.470 --> 00:56.990]  Fuck you. We're kicking you out.
[00:57.050 --> 00:59.410]  Even though we built this arena specifically for you.
[00:59.530 --> 01:01.410]  We're not going to let you lease here again.
[01:01.930 --> 01:03.730]  So they needed to panic, make an arena.
[01:03.730 --> 01:07.710]  And the only arena in the area that they could go to is a college arena.
[01:08.010 --> 01:10.430]  And they'd have to, like, readjust it.
[01:10.430 --> 01:12.910]  So they'd remove it's 5000 seats currently,
[01:12.910 --> 01:16.810]  and they've removed 2000 seats to make it NHL like ready.
[01:17.050 --> 01:21.670]  Yeah. So they will spend the next three years in a 3000 seat arena.
[01:22.070 --> 01:22.810]  That's insane.
[01:22.930 --> 01:28.330]  Their arena in like I've been to that arena,
[01:28.430 --> 01:31.430]  like, you know, been like in that area, like that arena is it's huge.
[01:31.530 --> 01:32.210]  It's really nice.
[01:32.310 --> 01:34.010]  Everything's like built up around it and everything.
[01:34.450 --> 01:36.710]  Why would they stop? Why? That's insane.
[01:37.070 --> 01:37.570]  They're terrible.
[01:37.910 --> 01:39.930]  What what's going to happen to the nice arena?
[01:39.930 --> 01:43.050]  They said they're just going to try to pivot away and find other things
[01:43.050 --> 01:43.770]  to book through it.
[01:43.850 --> 01:45.550]  I don't know if that means musical events or what.
[01:45.750 --> 01:48.070]  You know, you change it to concerts and stuff like that.
[01:48.270 --> 01:52.130]  It's built in the middle like they built all like this dining
[01:52.130 --> 01:53.570]  and shopping and everything around.
[01:53.710 --> 01:55.350]  It's like in the middle of like, you know, it's like the way
[01:55.350 --> 01:58.070]  that every arena is now where like there's just shit around it.
[01:58.510 --> 01:59.430]  You know what they should do?
[01:59.550 --> 02:02.330]  They should turn it into the world's largest Starbucks.
[02:02.870 --> 02:04.530]  It would be packed all the time.
[02:05.490 --> 02:08.570]  We should we should just see if we can get the naming rights to the thing
[02:08.570 --> 02:10.510]  that isn't for the coyotes anymore.
[02:11.170 --> 02:13.010]  Oh, yeah. Why Starbucks?
[02:13.630 --> 02:15.190]  Because I've never been to a Starbucks
[02:15.190 --> 02:17.310]  that doesn't have a line of 400 cars in front of it.
[02:17.550 --> 02:18.350]  Clearly, there's demand.
[02:18.930 --> 02:20.190]  You got to go to bookstores.
[02:20.410 --> 02:21.130]  I like a Starbucks.
[02:21.690 --> 02:22.870]  Well, I mean, don't get me wrong.
[02:22.910 --> 02:25.550]  I love books, but I don't think you're going to fill an arena with book fans.
[02:26.290 --> 02:27.670]  No, I'm saying Starbucks.
[02:27.830 --> 02:29.490]  The Starbucks and bookstores never have lines.
[02:30.150 --> 02:30.930]  That's where I live.
[02:31.370 --> 02:34.410]  Yeah, there's zero cars at the Starbucks inside of a bookstore.
[02:34.410 --> 02:38.170]  And I will say this and like Austin is one of those like fucking
[02:38.170 --> 02:39.550]  Austin's a foodie city, right?
[02:39.650 --> 02:41.030]  So they have like tons of fuck.
[02:41.130 --> 02:41.590]  We're recording.
[02:41.670 --> 02:42.310]  I heard that.
[02:43.330 --> 02:44.090]  It's time.
[02:44.430 --> 02:45.530]  Oh, there's Gavin, too.
[02:45.990 --> 02:50.030]  Anyway, Austin's a coffee city and they have a bunch of snobby coffee shops.
[02:50.230 --> 02:54.290]  But that being said, Starbucks has drive throughs and every drive through is slammed.
[02:55.110 --> 02:56.170]  Morning, Gavin. Good morning.
[02:56.350 --> 02:57.250]  Good morning.
[02:57.730 --> 02:58.870]  Do you drive through for coffee?
[02:58.890 --> 03:00.370]  Yeah, I drive through for coffee all the time.
[03:00.790 --> 03:03.390]  They got rid of the fat free fruit swirl.
[03:03.390 --> 03:05.070]  And I've been I lost.
[03:05.290 --> 03:05.790]  They lost me.
[03:06.010 --> 03:07.370]  You know what they have their small pies?
[03:07.530 --> 03:08.430]  What? Starbucks?
[03:08.770 --> 03:10.770]  Yes. They used to have these mini apple pies.
[03:10.870 --> 03:11.210]  They were great.
[03:11.370 --> 03:14.870]  Oh, what I'm I'm a big fan of at Starbucks is the black coffee.
[03:16.330 --> 03:17.430]  And they still have it.
[03:17.470 --> 03:21.110]  Like no matter when I go, no matter what time of day,
[03:21.170 --> 03:24.510]  if I can get through the line, there's a black coffee waiting for me.
[03:24.550 --> 03:25.510]  They never run out.
[03:25.630 --> 03:27.530]  They have that shit stocked to the gills.
[03:27.610 --> 03:28.210]  I appreciate it.
[03:28.670 --> 03:32.370]  I didn't know until very recently that you could put cream in a black coffee.
[03:32.370 --> 03:35.010]  I thought it would lose its title of blackness.
[03:35.090 --> 03:35.510]  What?
[03:36.170 --> 03:37.770]  Oh, wait, what?
[03:38.210 --> 03:40.150]  Huh? What did you think it becomes?
[03:40.990 --> 03:45.410]  Well, well, I just I don't I thought that it immediately once you put cream in it,
[03:45.430 --> 03:46.670]  it was no longer a black coffee.
[03:46.750 --> 03:49.370]  I thought a black coffee was just nothing but the coffee.
[03:49.650 --> 03:50.730]  Isn't that what it is?
[03:51.210 --> 03:54.930]  I think once you put in sugar, it no longer is a black coffee.
[03:54.970 --> 03:56.130]  Or is it cream as well?
[03:56.670 --> 03:57.110]  What?
[03:58.070 --> 03:58.970]  I don't know.
[03:59.290 --> 04:00.790]  I don't drink coffee.
[04:00.790 --> 04:02.710]  I I order black.
[04:03.710 --> 04:09.030]  I will say in in Australia and other places outside of the US,
[04:09.030 --> 04:12.310]  if you put cream in a coffee or milk, they call it a flat white.
[04:12.890 --> 04:13.810]  Right. Flat white.
[04:14.250 --> 04:17.690]  OK, so on some some hemispheres, I think you're correct.
[04:18.110 --> 04:20.430]  OK, you order a black coffee in Australia.
[04:20.530 --> 04:21.570]  They look at you like you're an asshole.
[04:21.710 --> 04:22.870]  And you're like, I get it. I am.
[04:22.930 --> 04:26.290]  But why would you get that reaction?
[04:26.370 --> 04:27.670]  You're creating less work.
[04:27.670 --> 04:30.130]  I'd assume it's the most simplistic
[04:30.130 --> 04:31.410]  form of good.
[04:31.790 --> 04:34.890]  I think in Australia, they pride themselves on their work when it comes to coffee.
[04:34.970 --> 04:39.010]  That is a like commissioning a famous artist and just being like,
[04:39.110 --> 04:41.570]  hey, can you paint me a white canvas?
[04:41.810 --> 04:45.790]  Yeah, they they take it so fucking seriously over there.
[04:45.890 --> 04:47.870]  They they're newer to the coffee game.
[04:47.910 --> 04:51.770]  But like I had a joke about this in Australia for stand up
[04:51.770 --> 04:54.250]  when we did the tour a couple of years ago.
[04:54.570 --> 04:57.170]  They they kicked out Starbucks.
[04:57.750 --> 05:01.510]  Starbucks closed 70% of all of their coffee shops in Australia.
[05:01.770 --> 05:05.850]  It's the only place on earth that isn't Starbucks isn't destroying.
[05:06.130 --> 05:08.850]  And it's just because the Australians are like, it's not good enough.
[05:09.150 --> 05:10.670]  We're that snobby about our coffee.
[05:10.770 --> 05:12.170]  They take it so seriously.
[05:12.750 --> 05:13.850]  Every single Australian.
[05:14.590 --> 05:16.170]  Yeah, pretty much all continent.
[05:16.430 --> 05:19.310]  Have you ever felt pressure when you're in like a restaurant of that type,
[05:19.370 --> 05:23.230]  like a subway or something where you can customize your order to like add things
[05:23.230 --> 05:26.410]  that you feel like you're being judged if you don't have enough items on your
[05:26.410 --> 05:30.130]  your your meal or whatever you drink, whatever it happens to be.
[05:30.450 --> 05:33.290]  I the first time I went the subway, I just had a turkey sandwich,
[05:33.290 --> 05:35.070]  just like plain just bread and turkey.
[05:35.070 --> 05:38.030]  And it's maybe the most judged I've ever felt in my life.
[05:38.650 --> 05:40.450]  Oh, because they like go down the line.
[05:40.690 --> 05:42.730]  And yeah, because they go down the line and there's like, yep.
[05:42.750 --> 05:43.930]  No, don't want lettuce.
[05:43.990 --> 05:44.890]  Don't want you can.
[05:45.050 --> 05:46.510]  Nope. Peppers don't want that.
[05:46.570 --> 05:47.870]  No cheese. Not a big fan of cheese.
[05:47.930 --> 05:49.370]  No, you don't need to salt and pepper it either.
[05:49.850 --> 05:51.030]  Don't need to toast it.
[05:51.130 --> 05:54.830]  Just yeah, just the bread and some turkey, please.
[05:55.730 --> 05:56.530]  Thank you.
[05:57.230 --> 05:58.790]  Is that really what you would get there?
[05:59.190 --> 06:01.230]  No, not now. I've evolved since then.
[06:01.330 --> 06:03.810]  That was my first my first subway experience.
[06:03.810 --> 06:07.010]  I was taken to a subway and I ordered just a plain turkey,
[06:07.530 --> 06:11.190]  nothing else, just honey out, I think, or whatever the honey bread is.
[06:11.330 --> 06:14.690]  I feel like the subway is one of the few places, not that I've eaten there
[06:14.690 --> 06:17.330]  the last 10 years, but it's one of the few places where I can get exactly
[06:17.330 --> 06:20.810]  what I want because they encourage like going down the line.
[06:20.810 --> 06:23.950]  If there's just a place with a menu and you have to like
[06:23.950 --> 06:27.790]  just say all the modifications up front, I don't ever do it
[06:27.790 --> 06:29.490]  because I just want to order something that's a number.
[06:29.770 --> 06:33.750]  Typically, I can't eat at Subway because their bread tastes like wet chemicals.
[06:34.010 --> 06:35.790]  But I agree with you in theory.
[06:36.110 --> 06:37.670]  You don't even have to. You just have to point at shit.
[06:37.830 --> 06:41.990]  You know, you know, you know how McDonald's is like
[06:43.090 --> 06:45.370]  entirely consistent, no matter what country you're in.
[06:45.450 --> 06:47.830]  You can pretty much get what you're used to.
[06:48.230 --> 06:51.330]  Subway is in so many places.
[06:51.330 --> 06:53.390]  There are so many subways around the earth
[06:53.390 --> 06:54.970]  and they're all completely different.
[06:55.210 --> 06:56.870]  Oh, yeah. It's strange to me.
[06:57.050 --> 07:00.150]  Like New Zealand makes a lot of the bread for Subway
[07:00.150 --> 07:02.250]  and it blows my fucking mind.
[07:02.330 --> 07:05.990]  The idea of like you going into a subway and leaving with bread
[07:05.990 --> 07:08.250]  that was made in an entirely different country.
[07:08.630 --> 07:12.850]  It's just so weird for me to process like all the where it was all sourced.
[07:12.910 --> 07:13.830]  Like it's fucking wild.
[07:14.230 --> 07:16.630]  I think the weird thing is how processed that bread is for it
[07:16.630 --> 07:17.870]  to be able to survive that trip.
[07:18.710 --> 07:21.850]  When Millie and I I'm not like I said, I'm not a huge Subway fan,
[07:21.850 --> 07:25.110]  but when Millie and I were we went to vacation like a daddy daughter
[07:25.110 --> 07:27.750]  vacation to Iceland a couple of years ago at this point, like maybe
[07:28.330 --> 07:30.690]  I don't know, three or seven or 12 years ago, whatever it was.
[07:32.030 --> 07:36.470]  And that city, I love Iceland, but Reykjavik shuts down at like 7 p.m.
[07:36.470 --> 07:37.890]  I feel like or at least when we were there.
[07:38.450 --> 07:41.650]  And so there were like we ate Subway almost every night
[07:41.650 --> 07:44.350]  because it was the only place open at like 8 p.m.
[07:44.470 --> 07:46.430]  And our food schedule is all backwards.
[07:46.670 --> 07:50.630]  And so we I spent so much fucking time in the subway in Reykjavik, Iceland.
[07:50.630 --> 07:53.790]  And it's not the same as a subway in America, but it's also not good.
[07:53.850 --> 07:56.090]  And I bet it's expensive as shit. Yeah, probably.
[07:56.370 --> 07:57.650]  What what's your bread preference?
[07:58.070 --> 07:59.730]  What's your go to bread in the world?
[08:00.050 --> 08:01.510]  No, not not in general.
[08:01.590 --> 08:04.550]  And Subway, not generally, it's way too broad of a question.
[08:04.690 --> 08:06.630]  We're talking Subway. They've got like six spreads.
[08:06.750 --> 08:09.530]  I like the idea that there's something that's too broad of a question for us.
[08:12.350 --> 08:14.810]  The fucking white bread, just white bread.
[08:14.910 --> 08:15.750]  OK, that's fine.
[08:16.450 --> 08:17.450]  I'm a flatbread guy.
[08:17.850 --> 08:20.630]  Doesn't sound like Gavin's been in there 10 years in the last 10 years.
[08:20.750 --> 08:23.450]  So that's why Gavin hasn't been there since they've had six breads.
[08:23.610 --> 08:26.190]  Oh, I was I always pick the third bread.
[08:26.550 --> 08:28.470]  The third bread is always the best bread.
[08:30.790 --> 08:33.710]  Now, like 90% of the time, the third bread is the best bread.
[08:34.910 --> 08:36.670]  Dude, you gotta think of a good ass bread, though.
[08:37.030 --> 08:39.190]  Do they have Jersey Mike's up in Canada?
[08:39.570 --> 08:40.590]  No, not where I live.
[08:40.870 --> 08:45.210]  Oh, dude, if you ever get a chance to eat Jersey Mike's Rosemary Parm,
[08:45.210 --> 08:49.930]  that bread, you, oh, it's a shame you can only eat it once.
[08:50.190 --> 08:51.450]  I don't know if this is controversial.
[08:51.670 --> 08:52.470]  I'm a Quiznos guy.
[08:52.630 --> 08:52.990]  Quiznos is good.
[08:53.070 --> 08:53.910]  I like me a Quiznos.
[08:54.290 --> 08:55.130]  I like Quiznos.
[08:55.610 --> 08:58.490]  They've got a honey mustard chicken sub.
[08:58.850 --> 08:59.950]  Fantastic. It's perfect.
[09:00.310 --> 09:01.710]  Best sandwich out there, in my opinion.
[09:01.970 --> 09:03.370]  Oh, hey, by the way, should we talk?
[09:04.190 --> 09:05.050]  Should we start the show?
[09:05.410 --> 09:06.310]  Yeah, it's 8.06.
[09:06.990 --> 09:07.650]  We're started.
[09:08.110 --> 09:08.950]  Why are we doing this?
[09:09.570 --> 09:10.170]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[09:10.170 --> 09:14.690]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[09:15.050 --> 09:18.770]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and I sure am happy you're along for the ride today.
[09:19.150 --> 09:22.510]  Along with us in the car, Andrew Panton over there in Canada,
[09:22.810 --> 09:25.770]  cabin free in Austin, Texas, by way of
[09:26.630 --> 09:28.010]  Her Majesty's England.
[09:28.570 --> 09:31.230]  And in the background, making everything work.
[09:31.270 --> 09:34.830]  We got Eric and Nick, and we're all awake at eight in the morning,
[09:35.270 --> 09:39.190]  having fun and fellowship together, wanting to start our day off right.
[09:39.190 --> 09:42.590]  The best way to start your day off is with a little bit of F*** Face.
[09:42.830 --> 09:43.630]  We agree.
[09:44.050 --> 09:48.390]  So everybody got up at eight o'clock for us here in Texas, six a.m.
[09:48.430 --> 09:49.050]  for Andrew.
[09:50.650 --> 09:51.010]  Bazinga!
[09:51.950 --> 09:55.670]  Not sure who recommended that we start at six a.m.
[09:55.690 --> 09:57.090]  for Andrew, but I love it.
[09:57.210 --> 09:58.630]  And he's been in a great mood all morning.
[09:58.910 --> 10:00.510]  I'm great. I just didn't sleep.
[10:00.650 --> 10:03.570]  Yeah, it's definitely my fault that it's eight a.m.
[10:03.590 --> 10:04.870]  But was it my suggestion?
[10:05.330 --> 10:06.010]  I think it might have been.
[10:06.310 --> 10:07.230]  I think it might have been.
[10:07.270 --> 10:08.270]  It might be a double whammy.
[10:08.270 --> 10:08.890]  It might have been.
[10:08.890 --> 10:09.990]  Well, I'm excited, though.
[10:10.030 --> 10:12.750]  This is going to be an interesting process of a day.
[10:13.070 --> 10:13.950]  I didn't sleep.
[10:14.090 --> 10:14.990]  I don't know what recording.
[10:15.170 --> 10:17.290]  I expected the morning one to be the one I suffered.
[10:17.430 --> 10:18.190]  It might be the evening.
[10:18.590 --> 10:21.090]  We might have a complete flip of what I thought would happen.
[10:21.210 --> 10:22.670]  How many hours till we record again?
[10:26.830 --> 10:29.950]  Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, thirteen, thirteen, fourteen hours till we record.
[10:30.030 --> 10:31.670]  Yeah, we're going to record another one.
[10:31.770 --> 10:35.750]  So we're doing the morning, the zany morning F*** Face show.
[10:35.750 --> 10:40.390]  And then it was said, it was put to us that we had to do three this week
[10:41.410 --> 10:44.690]  and someone wanted to do two on Tuesday, but I'm busy all of Tuesday.
[10:44.850 --> 10:47.250]  So we decided just to put it at either end of the busy.
[10:47.590 --> 10:49.570]  Yeah, we're just going to make you a little extra busy.
[10:49.830 --> 10:50.770]  We sandwiched the busy.
[10:52.530 --> 10:53.890]  So we did one at 8 a.m.
[10:53.890 --> 10:55.390]  and one at 10 p.m.
[10:55.450 --> 10:58.090]  11 p.m., 11 p.m., 11 p.m.
[10:58.090 --> 10:59.590]  It's at 11, it's at 11.
[11:02.750 --> 11:04.870]  I thought it was 10 too.
[11:04.870 --> 11:08.950]  I looked last night and laughed when I saw it was 11 for you guys.
[11:09.250 --> 11:10.510]  No, it's 11. That's it.
[11:10.550 --> 11:11.370]  We f*** Andrew.
[11:11.610 --> 11:14.710]  And then at the beginning of the day, he f***s us at the end of the day.
[11:14.770 --> 11:15.410]  That's how it works.
[11:16.630 --> 11:17.490]  And then nobody's happy.
[11:18.310 --> 11:21.490]  I assume we all woke up within the last hour, right?
[11:22.050 --> 11:23.750]  I haven't slept. Seven.
[11:24.070 --> 11:25.930]  Yeah, that was my first question.
[11:27.910 --> 11:31.530]  Look, right. Six isn't 3 a.m.
[11:32.130 --> 11:33.990]  Three. Yeah, stay up, right?
[11:33.990 --> 11:35.830]  No, six is like the next day.
[11:35.930 --> 11:36.810]  It's the next morning.
[11:37.110 --> 11:37.990]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11:38.130 --> 11:41.350]  Listen, Cory, boy, I tried to go to sleep
[11:41.350 --> 11:45.170]  and I kept waking up every 45 minutes that I slept through my alarm.
[11:45.350 --> 11:47.430]  So I said, f*** it, I'm just going to stay up.
[11:47.870 --> 11:50.850]  And so I've just been up since like, I don't know, 2 a.m.
[11:51.050 --> 11:52.250]  What have you been doing?
[11:52.550 --> 11:53.690]  What have you been doing with your time?
[11:54.270 --> 11:57.990]  I just largely in the bathtub, just stretched out in the bathtub
[11:57.990 --> 12:00.250]  and the general call, waiting to see what was going on.
[12:00.790 --> 12:03.610]  I said, what time did you join the call?
[12:03.990 --> 12:04.870]  I joined the call.
[12:05.030 --> 12:06.150]  I tweet it whenever I tweet.
[12:06.270 --> 12:09.330]  I tweet at like 3 a.m. that I'm joining the call for pleasantries.
[12:09.470 --> 12:11.170]  I was in the call since 3 a.m.
[12:11.250 --> 12:13.490]  I've been ready for pleasantries. I'm a very pleasant morning.
[12:14.010 --> 12:17.750]  The way you handle something that could be just solved with two alarms is
[12:17.750 --> 12:19.330]  unbelievable. I set three of them.
[12:19.410 --> 12:20.830]  I didn't trust them. I didn't trust them.
[12:21.230 --> 12:23.810]  Can you imagine not trusting three alarms?
[12:24.070 --> 12:25.270]  Here's what I don't trust about it.
[12:25.330 --> 12:29.850]  I changed my all of my f***ing alert noises to Gavin going, ooh, oh no.
[12:30.090 --> 12:33.310]  And I wasn't sure if the alarm would also be that.
[12:33.310 --> 12:35.130]  And I think I would sleep through that.
[12:35.290 --> 12:38.550]  So I just I was having like reoccurring nightmares,
[12:38.710 --> 12:40.350]  essentially, of sleeping through the show.
[12:40.610 --> 12:42.270]  So then I couldn't get to sleep.
[12:42.330 --> 12:44.490]  And I thought, if I'm only going to sleep at 30 minute bursts,
[12:44.490 --> 12:47.510]  like I don't know what I'll be more tired doing that,
[12:47.550 --> 12:49.310]  I think, than if I just stay up.
[12:49.470 --> 12:53.570]  So I'll tell you who was who's apparently the most tired out of all of us
[12:53.570 --> 12:57.410]  is I just looked over is my my co-pilot, Henry Hatfield.
[12:57.690 --> 13:02.710]  He is he's in his normal little day bed that he sits in where he squeaks.
[13:02.710 --> 13:04.350]  And he's just f***ing snoring away.
[13:04.490 --> 13:07.030]  He is out of it is way too early in the morning for him.
[13:07.090 --> 13:09.930]  He's like, I'm not ready to clock in on the on the squeaks.
[13:10.010 --> 13:13.530]  Yeah, he's going to be disappointed later that he missed one.
[13:14.030 --> 13:16.590]  Yeah, he is. He's also he goes to bed early, too.
[13:16.650 --> 13:18.390]  So he I doubt he'll be up at 11 p.m. tonight.
[13:18.670 --> 13:20.630]  Well, Andrew, I think you've wrecked yourself here
[13:20.630 --> 13:22.670]  because you have work to do between the recording.
[13:22.890 --> 13:26.930]  No, I'm this is I think I'm sharper than I've ever been with this approach.
[13:27.250 --> 13:31.750]  I'm I'm excited for the sandwich of a day and of a bet.
[13:32.310 --> 13:34.390]  I realized I don't have anything to lose,
[13:34.630 --> 13:37.370]  I think, based on what we've talked about before.
[13:37.430 --> 13:39.850]  I guess the losing is just having to do the work.
[13:40.350 --> 13:41.090]  What is the bet?
[13:41.450 --> 13:44.570]  So we were playing Halo like last week.
[13:45.110 --> 13:49.350]  And I asked Gavin a question and his response.
[13:49.550 --> 13:54.090]  I said, I think I could have had a million guesses and I wouldn't have ever said
[13:54.630 --> 13:56.270]  what the answer to the question was.
[13:56.750 --> 13:59.290]  I mean, you want to say that, say the question.
[13:59.330 --> 14:00.690]  I don't remember what the question was.
[14:01.230 --> 14:05.510]  Oh yeah, well, Andrew is always asking very inquisitive questions
[14:05.510 --> 14:06.190]  while I play Halo.
[14:06.390 --> 14:09.270]  He said, you know, get to know each other, even still to this point.
[14:09.650 --> 14:11.990]  Of course, he asked me, he asked me why I was interested in
[14:11.990 --> 14:14.570]  or how I got into slow-mo, what made me interested in it.
[14:14.750 --> 14:17.950]  And I said it was an episode of Tom and Jerry where.
[14:19.010 --> 14:22.250]  I think Tom makes some sort of high speed camera
[14:22.250 --> 14:24.830]  to catch a very fast mouse that's eating the cheese
[14:24.830 --> 14:27.670]  that he can't see with his human eyes or cat eyes.
[14:27.850 --> 14:29.210]  And I was like, oh, that's really interesting.
[14:29.210 --> 14:32.670]  And that was like the first thing that got me intrigued by it as a child.
[14:33.530 --> 14:37.150]  And Andrew said that in a million guesses, he wouldn't have guessed Tom and Jerry.
[14:37.590 --> 14:42.230]  And I said to him, I don't think you could name a million things.
[14:42.990 --> 14:44.930]  Tom and Jerry would have to be in there
[14:44.930 --> 14:47.290]  because I don't think he could name a million other things.
[14:47.930 --> 14:51.490]  I think he's greatly underestimating how many things I know.
[14:52.110 --> 14:53.250]  I know so many things.
[14:53.690 --> 14:57.750]  I put it to him that given a day, he couldn't even name 20,000 things.
[14:57.750 --> 15:00.650]  So what how do you name 20,000 things?
[15:01.290 --> 15:05.070]  I'm going to open a Word document and I'm just going to start writing the things I know.
[15:06.710 --> 15:08.130]  I can you do can you do a favor?
[15:08.230 --> 15:10.490]  Can you do can I add to this? Of course.
[15:10.910 --> 15:15.630]  After you complete your Word document, can you record yourself saying the 20,000 things?
[15:15.810 --> 15:16.630]  That's a great idea.
[15:16.810 --> 15:18.790]  I would love to release that as a piece of content.
[15:18.910 --> 15:21.010]  So I didn't consider that 20,000 things.
[15:21.630 --> 15:25.690]  So the bet is if I can complete the 20,000 things,
[15:25.690 --> 15:29.010]  Gavin has to print them at home in his own printer.
[15:29.590 --> 15:31.530]  We had a debate about font size.
[15:31.650 --> 15:33.370]  It has to be a single digit font size.
[15:33.530 --> 15:35.170]  It can be no higher than font size nine.
[15:36.410 --> 15:37.890]  No higher than font size.
[15:37.890 --> 15:38.590]  And I don't know.
[15:38.670 --> 15:41.270]  I don't know how many pages that's going to be, but I'm very excited.
[15:41.450 --> 15:44.270]  I'm committed to this, but we need to clarify a few things.
[15:44.270 --> 15:45.610]  So we just need to make sure the rules.
[15:45.710 --> 15:47.410]  I don't want to break any rules or cheat.
[15:47.550 --> 15:49.430]  So what what are the rules? What are the restrictions?
[15:49.770 --> 15:50.970]  I can't copy and paste.
[15:51.330 --> 15:52.170]  You can't copy and paste.
[15:52.250 --> 15:54.690]  I think you can't you can't just like Google things.
[15:54.690 --> 15:56.130]  I'm not allowed to Google at all.
[15:56.330 --> 15:59.070]  I think you just have to sit in front of a word pad, a notepad,
[15:59.130 --> 16:02.290]  and just think away at 20,000 different things.
[16:02.550 --> 16:05.670]  What if I walk away for a little bit and I get inspired?
[16:05.850 --> 16:07.690]  Like, what if a seagull flies by my window?
[16:07.790 --> 16:09.350]  And I'm like, fine, it's absolutely fine.
[16:09.770 --> 16:13.790]  OK, so it's anything that I can think of, as well as what I encounter
[16:13.790 --> 16:16.510]  in the world without specifically searching for it.
[16:16.570 --> 16:20.690]  Yeah. And you can't just write a list of words like a word isn't a thing.
[16:20.890 --> 16:22.970]  OK, but you could write Google.
[16:22.970 --> 16:23.790]  Google's a thing.
[16:24.010 --> 16:25.310]  Google is a thing. Yeah.
[16:26.110 --> 16:28.530]  I don't know. I Google 20,000 things and see what it is.
[16:28.530 --> 16:32.630]  OK, what about can I can I do multiple things if they're different,
[16:32.810 --> 16:34.990]  if they're different things, but they're they're written the same?
[16:35.570 --> 16:35.990]  What do you mean?
[16:36.610 --> 16:40.010]  Can I claim pork and beans, the food and pork and beans, the Weezer song?
[16:41.030 --> 16:41.750]  Yes. Yeah.
[16:41.970 --> 16:44.650]  Those are two things. OK, fucking easy.
[16:45.090 --> 16:46.770]  I can do this by the time we're done recording.
[16:47.010 --> 16:49.830]  This is going to index really high on Google, by the way, when we release this,
[16:49.830 --> 16:52.070]  because the number one thing when you search for 20,000 things
[16:52.070 --> 16:55.270]  is just 20,000 things you can buy with 20,000 dollars.
[16:55.690 --> 16:56.430]  Huh? I should.
[16:56.830 --> 17:00.450]  I in my head, Andrew's going to be flying out of the gate.
[17:00.530 --> 17:02.270]  Thing, thing, thing. It's going to be crazy.
[17:02.330 --> 17:03.410]  It's going to be not going to stop.
[17:03.530 --> 17:07.430]  But after about 4000 things a few hours in,
[17:07.730 --> 17:10.070]  I think he's really going to be struggling for things.
[17:10.310 --> 17:12.230]  You think 4000 is the line I'm going to hit?
[17:12.530 --> 17:14.630]  Yeah, I think that'll be a wall.
[17:15.650 --> 17:17.910]  Do you think like that's like the bad part of the marathon
[17:17.910 --> 17:19.470]  when you're like, I don't know if I can do it?
[17:19.530 --> 17:21.790]  I'm at mile 19. I can't believe I have seven more to go.
[17:22.070 --> 17:24.730]  Well, because you've got to have all this done by 11 p.m. tonight.
[17:25.190 --> 17:29.470]  Yes. So how many things is so how many hours till what is that?
[17:29.690 --> 17:31.130]  That's going to be 13 hours.
[17:31.570 --> 17:34.570]  So 20,000 divided by 13
[17:35.730 --> 17:40.170]  is fifteen hundred and thirty eight things an hour divided by 60.
[17:40.730 --> 17:42.410]  OK, I have another question.
[17:42.550 --> 17:43.750]  Twenty five things a minute.
[17:44.470 --> 17:46.470]  Oh, you can do a thing every two seconds. That's fine.
[17:47.130 --> 17:48.370]  I have another rules clarification.
[17:49.310 --> 17:51.270]  Yeah. I don't have a portable computer.
[17:52.070 --> 17:55.210]  If I go on the road, can I use my phone and then copy
[17:55.210 --> 17:57.950]  and paste what I wrote in my phone to my Word document?
[17:58.170 --> 18:00.650]  Well, here's the thing that you're going to want is you're going to want
[18:00.650 --> 18:04.490]  access to the Word document, because I assume you want to have a system
[18:04.490 --> 18:07.930]  where you I assume you want to have a system like a computer.
[18:08.450 --> 18:09.890]  It's like flashing my face.
[18:10.650 --> 18:13.570]  It's like blinding me. I don't know what's going on.
[18:14.390 --> 18:15.510]  It's like not only
[18:15.510 --> 18:18.690]  my computer always does this at 816 every morning.
[18:18.750 --> 18:19.870]  You just never wait to see it.
[18:20.430 --> 18:24.150]  I've never seen a computer issue cause somebody to have a human issue.
[18:24.170 --> 18:28.030]  Like you lost the inability to speak because your computer was broken.
[18:28.350 --> 18:30.710]  Now, what it is, is that my screensaver tries to start,
[18:30.810 --> 18:33.750]  but it freaks out for like five seconds flashing shit in my face
[18:33.750 --> 18:34.730]  before it actually starts.
[18:35.730 --> 18:36.730]  Here's what you're going to want.
[18:37.150 --> 18:40.430]  You're going to want it so that when you press enter, it numbers
[18:40.430 --> 18:41.970]  it like increments one number.
[18:42.710 --> 18:44.030]  Yes, I agree.
[18:44.130 --> 18:45.190]  You're going to want it counted as you go.
[18:45.290 --> 18:47.950]  So either you need a Google Doc or you need a Word doc that you can.
[18:48.590 --> 18:49.770]  I think Google Doc.
[18:50.110 --> 18:53.410]  Well, OK, who has to verify that there's 20,000 if that breaks?
[18:53.590 --> 18:54.050]  Isn't me.
[18:54.390 --> 18:55.750]  Do I have to do that independently later?
[18:56.470 --> 18:59.310]  Because I'm saying let's say it's let's say we get to six o'clock
[18:59.310 --> 19:00.370]  and I'm running out of things.
[19:00.850 --> 19:04.570]  If I just go to a bookstore and just look around at the books,
[19:05.130 --> 19:06.450]  can't bring my computer with me.
[19:06.690 --> 19:08.330]  Do I have to catalog that?
[19:08.650 --> 19:11.590]  Well, first of all, can I copy and paste if I write on my phone
[19:11.590 --> 19:12.770]  to then my computer?
[19:13.110 --> 19:16.530]  And then do I have to catalog that properly within my time limit?
[19:16.530 --> 19:17.490]  Or can I do that after?
[19:18.030 --> 19:20.730]  It seems that Eric is wanting to chime in with some rules here.
[19:21.030 --> 19:22.150]  Just use a Google Doc.
[19:22.430 --> 19:26.630]  You can get the numbered thing because you can take a Google Doc on your phone.
[19:27.270 --> 19:27.850]  And it's a great point.
[19:27.930 --> 19:29.570]  You don't have to copy and paste anything.
[19:29.690 --> 19:33.130]  It is just it's in a cloud, which is not a place,
[19:33.150 --> 19:34.730]  but a thing that you can access.
[19:35.630 --> 19:38.410]  And then I'm telling you this.
[19:38.490 --> 19:39.830]  The numbering is on you.
[19:40.170 --> 19:42.630]  This is I'm being crystal clear.
[19:42.630 --> 19:45.370]  The numbering from the beginning.
[19:45.570 --> 19:48.250]  It better start with one and go sequentially.
[19:48.670 --> 19:53.730]  This is not a, oh, man, it started numbering and then it became dots.
[19:53.810 --> 19:56.910]  It better be numbers front to back here.
[19:57.050 --> 19:58.130]  Here's another clarification.
[19:58.690 --> 20:00.950]  Do I need to label the specific things?
[20:01.470 --> 20:03.230]  Can I just write pork and beans twice?
[20:03.230 --> 20:05.350]  Or do I have to write pork and bean song?
[20:05.690 --> 20:06.890]  Pork and beans. You have to you.
[20:07.050 --> 20:10.170]  Yeah, because we're not going to go through 20,000 things and go,
[20:10.310 --> 20:11.750]  what did you mean by pork and beans twice?
[20:11.750 --> 20:14.870]  And you go, I don't know, because when we started this,
[20:14.990 --> 20:17.390]  you said, I don't remember the question you asked me.
[20:17.690 --> 20:19.430]  So, yeah, clarify the best that you can.
[20:19.550 --> 20:22.470]  Yeah, we're going to have to search for duplicates at the end, right?
[20:22.570 --> 20:23.530]  Yeah. To make sure.
[20:23.610 --> 20:27.270]  And if there are two of the same entry without an in brackets
[20:27.270 --> 20:30.890]  clarification of two different things, then we've got a problem.
[20:31.030 --> 20:32.910]  I think I should get a window to clarify.
[20:33.070 --> 20:36.830]  And if I can't, that's clearly I fucked up and I will take a loss on that.
[20:37.070 --> 20:40.590]  And worst case scenario, if he doesn't number it, we can always just copy it
[20:40.590 --> 20:42.410]  and paste it into Excel and count.
[20:42.470 --> 20:45.890]  OK, if he doesn't number it, then Geoff can copy it and paste it into Excel.
[20:47.490 --> 20:48.710]  I don't know what you would give.
[20:48.810 --> 20:50.150]  I don't know why you would give him an inch.
[20:50.310 --> 20:51.670]  Why? Why would you give him an inch?
[20:51.830 --> 20:52.890]  I learned this from Gus.
[20:53.310 --> 20:55.270]  I learned this from Gus. Why would you give him an inch?
[20:55.650 --> 20:57.910]  Why? To what? To whose benefit?
[20:58.530 --> 20:59.350]  I hope to the audience.
[21:00.030 --> 21:01.570]  The insane Google Docs.
[21:01.630 --> 21:03.350]  I'll make this right now. Things I know.
[21:03.810 --> 21:06.890]  I don't know many things, but I do know a lot of things.
[21:07.350 --> 21:09.650]  I don't know many things, but I do know exactly 20,000.
[21:10.210 --> 21:11.850]  Yes. How many do you think I'll get, Geoff?
[21:12.230 --> 21:14.730]  What do you think of the odds of this coming together?
[21:15.290 --> 21:19.590]  I think you'll you'll get as far into this as your as your decision
[21:19.590 --> 21:22.890]  to watch all of season two of Salt Lake City Real Housewives.
[21:23.170 --> 21:25.350]  So I imagine one you'll get one in.
[21:25.870 --> 21:28.010]  I'm trying. I'm trying.
[21:28.310 --> 21:29.070]  Yeah. Yeah.
[21:29.130 --> 21:31.910]  It's what happens if I win.
[21:32.410 --> 21:33.350]  Nothing. We didn't.
[21:33.450 --> 21:36.550]  That was a mistake, I think, on your end is that we agreed to the terms.
[21:36.650 --> 21:39.530]  And I think my punishment is that I spent my day
[21:39.530 --> 21:42.310]  attempting to write 20,000 things that I'd
[21:44.750 --> 21:48.090]  ever at every point of especially the fact
[21:48.090 --> 21:50.350]  they haven't really slept going into this day.
[21:50.470 --> 21:53.530]  At every moment of this day, after we're done recording,
[21:53.650 --> 21:55.790]  you will know exactly what I'm trying to do.
[21:55.830 --> 21:58.550]  Oh, and unless you knock out 20,000 things by lunch.
[21:58.690 --> 21:59.590]  That's true.
[22:00.230 --> 22:01.750]  Oh, dude. Write down lunch.
[22:01.830 --> 22:03.750]  That's one of the things that's great.
[22:04.550 --> 22:07.330]  I'm thinking about all the breads and Subway.
[22:08.390 --> 22:11.990]  Since since we decided this, he's been texting me just the occasional thing.
[22:12.250 --> 22:13.230]  Got to stretch my prowess.
[22:13.290 --> 22:14.510]  Got to show him I'm the real deal.
[22:14.690 --> 22:15.870]  Earlier this week, he
[22:17.690 --> 22:18.710]  he just text me.
[22:18.850 --> 22:20.410]  Wheel of Fortune, paprika.
[22:22.090 --> 22:23.550]  Two different things right there.
[22:24.910 --> 22:28.810]  I wrote I wrote I wrote egg Tiananmen Square.
[22:30.810 --> 22:32.150]  He's just giving me options.
[22:32.370 --> 22:33.210]  It's I don't know what he's doing.
[22:33.550 --> 22:34.550]  He's not taking this seriously.
[22:35.590 --> 22:39.430]  I can't wait to see how many pages this fucking thing is.
[22:39.970 --> 22:41.310]  I don't read it.
[22:41.410 --> 22:44.710]  I can't I can't figure out because it's such a weird task.
[22:44.890 --> 22:47.070]  I can't figure out whether it's really difficult or really easy.
[22:47.330 --> 22:48.230]  I think it's impossible.
[22:48.690 --> 22:49.650]  You think it's impossible?
[22:49.950 --> 22:50.810]  You're not going to do this.
[22:51.090 --> 22:52.250]  You're not going to come close.
[22:52.570 --> 22:53.850]  You think it's impossible?
[22:54.110 --> 22:56.190]  I'll be amazed if you get the 3000.
[22:56.770 --> 22:58.250]  Really? You're going to lose.
[22:58.370 --> 22:59.770]  You're going to lose your mind.
[23:00.230 --> 23:01.070]  I don't think so.
[23:01.270 --> 23:03.850]  I'm I'm excited to present this list later.
[23:04.290 --> 23:07.110]  It's a funny it's a funny idea for about 20 minutes.
[23:07.210 --> 23:09.510]  And then you look up and you're like, I still have 12 hours.
[23:09.610 --> 23:10.770]  And I better I'm behind.
[23:11.010 --> 23:11.910]  I got to get going.
[23:12.450 --> 23:13.570]  That's your miscalculation.
[23:13.730 --> 23:15.370]  I don't think this is funny at all.
[23:15.530 --> 23:17.270]  I just think this is going to be a thing I can do.
[23:17.490 --> 23:18.730]  I don't think it's going to be difficult.
[23:18.910 --> 23:20.190]  I don't think it's amusing going in.
[23:20.270 --> 23:25.530]  I would I'm just so interested to find out where you stopped
[23:25.530 --> 23:29.330]  because you're going to have so many things ready to go in your head.
[23:29.370 --> 23:31.470]  You're literally not going to stop typing at the beginning
[23:32.650 --> 23:34.750]  until you don't have a word ready to go.
[23:34.890 --> 23:40.130]  So what I'm fascinated to know is that 50 words in or is that a thousand?
[23:40.270 --> 23:42.310]  I don't know. I have no idea when that will be for you.
[23:42.550 --> 23:43.930]  So how many what's the math on this?
[23:43.990 --> 23:46.950]  I need 25 words a minute for the entirety of.
[23:47.350 --> 23:48.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[23:48.470 --> 23:51.350]  And the longer you're on this podcast, the less time you have.
[23:51.870 --> 23:52.710]  That's a lot. That's true.
[23:52.730 --> 23:54.090]  I calculated 13 hours.
[23:54.170 --> 23:55.790]  We'll be four. It'll be 12 hours when.
[23:56.230 --> 23:56.590]  No, is that right?
[23:56.850 --> 23:57.790]  I got a hard out now.
[23:58.090 --> 24:00.250]  Well, I mean, we might who knows how long we're going to go for.
[24:00.250 --> 24:01.850]  I do. I do.
[24:02.850 --> 24:04.150]  I know how long I'll be here.
[24:04.590 --> 24:07.250]  Got words to write. I got a document to make 3000.
[24:07.790 --> 24:09.130]  You can be right. I could be greatly.
[24:09.230 --> 24:11.770]  It reminds me of there's in the challenge.
[24:11.950 --> 24:16.970]  One of the eliminations was you had to lift a thing filled with random items.
[24:17.350 --> 24:19.350]  And one of the items was watermelons.
[24:19.770 --> 24:22.010]  So like the two people have to go back and forth and be like,
[24:22.070 --> 24:23.750]  I can lift 40 watermelons.
[24:23.790 --> 24:26.390]  And eventually one of you would say, do it.
[24:26.430 --> 24:28.730]  And if you did it, then the other person was eliminated.
[24:28.730 --> 24:30.630]  And if you couldn't, then you were eliminated.
[24:30.970 --> 24:33.250]  And I think they got the like 33 watermelons.
[24:33.350 --> 24:34.250]  And the guy's like, do it.
[24:34.430 --> 24:36.410]  And the other guy just lifted it effortlessly.
[24:36.790 --> 24:39.730]  And he was like, I guess I don't really know what a watermelon weighs like.
[24:39.890 --> 24:42.110]  There's no I've never considered.
[24:43.430 --> 24:44.510]  So we're going to find out.
[24:44.570 --> 24:47.030]  I could be greatly overestimating this word thing.
[24:47.150 --> 24:47.930]  The math. Why don't we?
[24:48.270 --> 24:49.690]  Why don't we do a test minute?
[24:50.870 --> 24:52.330]  No, I can't do a test minute.
[24:52.410 --> 24:54.030]  What if we just start a minute?
[24:54.150 --> 24:55.970]  You have to know vocally.
[24:56.130 --> 24:57.130]  And this is great practice.
[24:58.250 --> 24:59.690]  Things endlessly for the minute.
[24:59.750 --> 25:00.310]  Could you do it?
[25:00.890 --> 25:02.170]  Uh, well, I'm in the dark.
[25:02.510 --> 25:05.610]  So this is going to be a, uh, I would I'd rather be in light.
[25:05.790 --> 25:07.290]  OK, turn the lights on.
[25:07.370 --> 25:09.130]  So, like, oh, no, no, no, no.
[25:09.130 --> 25:10.110]  Wait, pay your electric bill.
[25:10.330 --> 25:11.190]  Can I write these?
[25:11.230 --> 25:12.510]  I did pay my electric bill.
[25:12.590 --> 25:13.890]  Can I write these down right now?
[25:14.210 --> 25:15.490]  This could be preliminary work.
[25:15.630 --> 25:19.530]  So I get one minute right now and I could put in whatever I want to.
[25:19.610 --> 25:20.790]  For the next minute. Yeah.
[25:20.990 --> 25:23.350]  Yeah. Are you going to type as you as you say?
[25:23.470 --> 25:24.370]  Or are you going to just say,
[25:25.090 --> 25:26.810]  Uh, I think I'm going to type.
[25:27.150 --> 25:28.870]  I'm going to type as I say.
[25:29.350 --> 25:31.090]  OK, I mean, I mean, I made a Google Doc.
[25:31.150 --> 25:31.670]  I don't want to do that.
[25:31.750 --> 25:32.470]  I want to make a spreadsheet.
[25:32.910 --> 25:33.910]  Got a Google spreadsheets.
[25:34.390 --> 25:35.210]  So one minute.
[25:35.630 --> 25:36.870]  Yeah, I can do whatever I want.
[25:37.210 --> 25:39.470]  And I'll give you the go ahead and I'll I'll time it for a minute.
[25:40.150 --> 25:42.750]  OK, this is going to be I didn't expect this.
[25:42.830 --> 25:44.790]  This is a this is a sneaky tactic by you.
[25:44.870 --> 25:45.790]  You caught me off my game.
[25:47.270 --> 25:48.950]  I was not prepared for this.
[25:49.650 --> 25:50.870]  OK, let me know when you're ready.
[25:51.350 --> 25:52.350]  I'm loading in right now.
[25:52.350 --> 25:54.030]  I'm not even going to name the spreadsheet.
[25:57.750 --> 25:58.630]  OK. Ready?
[25:59.350 --> 25:59.970]  All right.
[26:00.030 --> 26:01.710]  Give me a countdown. Give me a countdown for one minute.
[26:01.910 --> 26:02.490]  You better stop.
[26:02.610 --> 26:04.250]  And you have to say say out loud as you type.
[26:04.430 --> 26:05.150]  So we can. All right.
[26:05.510 --> 26:07.470]  Three, two, one, go.
[26:08.030 --> 26:08.650]  Vin Diesel.
[26:10.970 --> 26:11.850]  Chimpanzee. Hockey.
[26:13.410 --> 26:13.850]  Skateboarding.
[26:15.010 --> 26:15.790]  Tony Hawk.
[26:17.830 --> 26:18.770]  Bob Bird Quest.
[26:20.270 --> 26:20.910]  Rodney Mullen.
[26:22.650 --> 26:23.910]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.
[26:26.090 --> 26:28.730]  I'm I'm actually talking faster than I'm typing,
[26:28.850 --> 26:30.530]  so I just wrote skateboarding two times in a row.
[26:30.790 --> 26:31.550]  Tony Hawk.
[26:33.090 --> 26:34.310]  Bob Bird Quest.
[26:36.350 --> 26:38.770]  I'm not even. Oh, God, this is I'm falling apart.
[26:38.870 --> 26:39.870]  I'm just going to rapidly talk.
[26:39.990 --> 26:40.850]  How much time do I have left?
[26:41.290 --> 26:41.970]  25 seconds.
[26:42.350 --> 26:43.210]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3.
[26:43.410 --> 26:44.350]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4.
[26:44.690 --> 26:45.430]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater
[26:46.530 --> 26:47.410]  American Wasteland.
[26:48.270 --> 26:50.250]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater Ride.
[26:51.090 --> 26:51.930]  Guitar Hero.
[26:51.930 --> 26:53.050]  Guitar Hero 2.
[26:53.450 --> 26:54.250]  Guitar Hero 3.
[26:54.630 --> 26:56.630]  Guitar Hero Aerosmith Edition.
[26:57.170 --> 26:58.990]  Guitar Hero ACDC.
[26:59.950 --> 27:00.910]  Rock Band.
[27:01.090 --> 27:01.950]  Rock Band 2.
[27:02.250 --> 27:03.350]  Rock Band 3.
[27:04.030 --> 27:04.690]  Rock Band.
[27:04.770 --> 27:05.170]  The Beatles.
[27:05.330 --> 27:05.910]  Rock Band.
[27:07.250 --> 27:09.170]  Guitar. A bass guitar.
[27:09.350 --> 27:09.950]  Oh, stop.
[27:12.010 --> 27:14.930]  Did anybody have a count on how many things that was?
[27:15.890 --> 27:17.490]  I I couldn't.
[27:17.550 --> 27:19.890]  I lost. I had lost the ability to type at four.
[27:19.890 --> 27:23.350]  I spelt Tony Hawk, Tony H.W.A.K.
[27:23.430 --> 27:26.090]  and I spelt chimpanzee with a J.
[27:26.630 --> 27:29.330]  I think I counted 17 things.
[27:29.850 --> 27:31.990]  There's no way it was just 17.
[27:32.230 --> 27:33.790]  I did. I wrote Tony Whack.
[27:35.810 --> 27:37.970]  So it's become clear
[27:38.470 --> 27:42.950]  that Andrew can get there if he knows 20,000 athletes in video games.
[27:43.130 --> 27:43.570]  That's it.
[27:44.050 --> 27:47.170]  Oh, I at least know a thousand of us.
[27:47.690 --> 27:49.710]  That's a pretty good technique.
[27:52.190 --> 27:54.990]  Numbering different iterations of the same thing is smart.
[27:55.590 --> 27:57.750]  Yeah. Because they are different things.
[27:58.190 --> 27:59.790]  Yeah. Vastly different.
[28:00.070 --> 28:02.610]  Halo 5 is very different from from Halo Reach.
[28:02.730 --> 28:04.290]  I didn't even touch on Halo.
[28:04.450 --> 28:05.870]  You're just giving me Halo now, Geoff.
[28:05.990 --> 28:06.970]  You just gave me seven games.
[28:07.110 --> 28:08.870]  I think it's saving me seven games.
[28:09.270 --> 28:10.870]  This fucking bet came from Halo.
[28:11.110 --> 28:12.130]  I assumed it would be.
[28:19.680 --> 28:20.140]  Introduction.
[28:20.260 --> 28:22.680]  Talk about how your business is off to a good start

[28:27.540 --> 28:29.560]  F***face is doing better than ever right now.
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.620]  We're in a growth period and things are definitely not getting any less crazy.

[28:44.920 --> 28:47.340]  And it's not going to slow down anytime soon.

[30:29.620 --> 30:30.720]  Relationships take work.
[30:30.880 --> 30:33.880]  A lot of us will drop anything to go help someone we care about.
[30:34.060 --> 30:36.160]  We'll go out of our way to treat other people well.
[30:36.460 --> 30:38.720]  But how often do we give ourselves the same treatment?
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.640]  It's really important to focus on yourself as much as you do other people,
[30:43.860 --> 30:47.280]  whether that be self-care or therapy.
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.940]  It's just making the same investment is is vital or else
[30:50.940 --> 30:53.060]  in my experience, you will burn out.
[30:53.540 --> 30:56.660]  This month, BetterHelp Online Therapy wants to remind you to take care
[30:56.660 --> 30:59.420]  of your most important relationship, the one you have with yourself.
[30:59.880 --> 31:03.460]  Whether it's hitting the gym, making time for your haircut or even trying therapy,
[31:03.580 --> 31:04.820]  you are your greatest asset.
[31:04.820 --> 31:08.860]  So invest the time and effort into yourself like you do for other people.
[31:09.980 --> 31:13.600]  If you are on the fence or if you've been thinking about trying therapy,
[31:13.800 --> 31:15.340]  I would highly recommend it.

[31:53.200 --> 31:54.760]  So that's my day. What about you guys?
[31:54.800 --> 31:56.260]  What are your plans for the day?
[31:56.540 --> 32:00.040]  Well, I actually I need to make an apology to Gavin real fast.
[32:00.880 --> 32:01.920]  Oh, Gavin, I'm sorry.
[32:03.220 --> 32:05.300]  OK, now that was sincere. I really am sorry.
[32:06.960 --> 32:09.000]  Do I know what this is in reference to?
[32:09.240 --> 32:10.320]  Oh, do I have to say why?
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.980]  Oh, shit. It's in general. It's generic.
[32:13.060 --> 32:14.500]  Why do you why do you think I would be sorry?
[32:17.080 --> 32:20.320]  Oh, oh, is it because when you were mad, but I didn't realize you were mad.
[32:20.760 --> 32:21.800]  No, no, that's funny.
[32:22.400 --> 32:23.680]  That was just me being funny.
[32:24.440 --> 32:25.940]  I was only pretending that anyway.
[32:26.520 --> 32:28.300]  When I told you I was taking a time out from our friendship.
[32:32.080 --> 32:35.300]  And then you you started texting me and I told you I would only respond to you
[32:35.300 --> 32:36.640]  during work hours because we're coworkers.
[32:37.700 --> 32:41.920]  I wanted just to add some some additional context to that, Geoff.
[32:42.140 --> 32:45.440]  We were playing Halo at that time or maybe it was after and Gavin was like,
[32:45.480 --> 32:47.040]  I think Geoff's really mad at us.
[32:47.120 --> 32:48.120]  I think he's mad at me.
[32:48.880 --> 32:51.940]  There is genuine concern in Gavin's part that you know.
[32:52.760 --> 32:53.460]  Yeah, I was worried.
[32:53.780 --> 32:55.420]  I get it. I'm the best friend anybody could have.
[32:55.480 --> 32:56.460]  I would hate to fuck that up, too.
[32:57.520 --> 32:59.100]  No, I apologize to you, Gavin,
[32:59.100 --> 33:04.120]  because when we planned this, I promised I said that I was going to get up early
[33:04.120 --> 33:05.880]  and I was going to drive to get breakfast for you.
[33:05.960 --> 33:06.540]  And I was going to take it.
[33:06.680 --> 33:07.820]  Oh, shit. You'll leave at your house.
[33:07.940 --> 33:09.840]  Oh, yeah. And I didn't.
[33:09.900 --> 33:11.580]  But it was on the agenda.
[33:11.960 --> 33:12.980]  I actually had a plan.
[33:13.100 --> 33:15.200]  I was going to go yesterday and I was going to buy a bunch of
[33:15.200 --> 33:19.220]  I was going to buy a bunch of cucumbers and I was going to stick them in a bag.
[33:19.400 --> 33:20.380]  And then I was going to throw
[33:21.960 --> 33:24.200]  I was going to throw I was going to go to Taco Rito
[33:24.700 --> 33:26.980]  or some taco place, get a couple of breakfast tacos,
[33:26.980 --> 33:28.280]  throw them in a bag with cucumbers.
[33:28.420 --> 33:31.980]  I was going to scale the side of your house, throw them in there and then leave
[33:31.980 --> 33:34.920]  and then tell you on camera, like while we were in the podcast,
[33:35.140 --> 33:36.520]  that there were tacos waiting for you.
[33:37.520 --> 33:41.440]  I didn't get I didn't get to it because of I had a bad day yesterday
[33:41.880 --> 33:44.360]  and it threw me off my game. But
[33:46.080 --> 33:47.180]  do you guys remember?
[33:47.980 --> 33:48.420]  Sorry, go ahead.
[33:49.140 --> 33:51.700]  No, I think that was I'm fine with that apology
[33:51.700 --> 33:54.460]  because it's sort of you messing with me.
[33:54.520 --> 33:56.380]  You're apologizing for not messing with me.
[33:56.380 --> 33:59.160]  Yeah, I mean, the tacos would have still been good tacos.
[34:00.160 --> 34:03.400]  That's true. If you'd if you'd have replaced them entirely with cucumbers.
[34:03.980 --> 34:06.840]  No, there would have been cucumbers and real tacos.
[34:07.020 --> 34:10.920]  I just have decided that I'm never going to put anything on your front door
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.900]  unless it includes cucumbers from here on out.
[34:16.100 --> 34:19.540]  I you guys remember how like for about a solid year,
[34:19.540 --> 34:23.260]  I had just a tremendous amount of teeth problems.
[34:23.820 --> 34:26.140]  Yes. Yeah. Well, oh, no.
[34:27.860 --> 34:31.220]  I hesitate. Oh, my God.
[34:32.380 --> 34:37.440]  No. Do you guys remember that root canal I got that took five
[34:37.440 --> 34:39.680]  the five root canals in one tooth?
[34:39.900 --> 34:41.840]  Not the surprise, the root canal?
[34:42.180 --> 34:45.480]  No, not the other two, but the initial one that kicked it all off.
[34:45.620 --> 34:47.680]  Yeah. To five, like two months I had.
[34:49.200 --> 34:51.720]  Geoff, Geoff has had so many root canals
[34:51.720 --> 34:54.600]  that it could be like a police lineup that we need to try to identify.
[34:54.780 --> 34:55.740]  There's like seven of them.
[34:55.960 --> 34:57.700]  It's like root canal three and five.
[34:57.800 --> 35:00.120]  Please step forward and say, oh,
[35:01.280 --> 35:03.520]  Geoff, root canal two, Geoff root canal three.
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.620]  I I was eating some hard candy on Saturday and I bit on it
[35:10.620 --> 35:15.200]  and I just had like a weird pain in the back of my one of my one of my molars.
[35:15.220 --> 35:16.100]  And I thought, oh, that's weird.
[35:16.380 --> 35:16.940]  Little sensitive.
[35:17.120 --> 35:19.900]  And then Sunday it started to be a little sore.
[35:19.900 --> 35:23.860]  Monday morning, I woke up from the pain at about 5 a.m.
[35:26.520 --> 35:27.400]  excruciating and
[35:29.320 --> 35:30.600]  went to the dentist.
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.560]  And there's a it's a long like six hour story about.
[35:38.280 --> 35:41.920]  Just incompetence and shit going wrong, and usually I delight in telling those,
[35:42.340 --> 35:46.220]  but I don't want to yell right now because my mouth hurts and I just I don't have the
[35:46.220 --> 35:49.180]  I don't have the energy to be angry, so I'm not going to go into all the
[35:49.180 --> 35:52.460]  particular ways the dentist and the pharmacy
[35:53.060 --> 35:55.620]  and everyone in Austin fucked me over yesterday.
[35:55.800 --> 35:58.680]  But everyone, you motherfuckers know who you are.
[35:59.220 --> 36:03.060]  Every single one of you knows what your incompetence did to me,
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.580]  knows the hours it took out of my life, knows the pain you caused me.
[36:07.960 --> 36:09.440]  And karma will find you.
[36:09.520 --> 36:10.560]  I'll tell you that right now.
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.060]  You six or seven just miserable sons of bitches out there.
[36:16.040 --> 36:17.340]  It's not going to be me,
[36:17.340 --> 36:20.720]  but some the universe will get revenge for what you've done to me.
[36:20.860 --> 36:21.680]  I'll just say that.
[36:21.760 --> 36:23.540]  That's all I'm going to say for everything that went on yesterday.
[36:23.660 --> 36:24.300]  That's all I'm going to say.
[36:24.540 --> 36:26.280]  I'm too upset to talk to get into it.
[36:26.500 --> 36:31.880]  But I went to the dentist eventually, and they were like, oh, yeah,
[36:31.900 --> 36:36.260]  it looks like I'm not going to get mad once they once I convinced them
[36:36.260 --> 36:37.540]  that it was the tooth that it was.
[36:37.680 --> 36:39.220]  I didn't have to fight with the lady anymore.
[36:39.540 --> 36:40.660]  Is this the same dentist?
[36:41.400 --> 36:42.680]  Well, that's part of the problem.
[36:43.180 --> 36:44.160]  That's part of the problem.
[36:44.740 --> 36:47.100]  I went to my dentist and my dentist is no longer there.
[36:47.340 --> 36:50.620]  My my dental company is a different has a different name on it now.
[36:50.800 --> 36:53.880]  My dentist office and most of the people are there, but my dentist is gone.
[36:53.960 --> 36:55.760]  And so all of a sudden I have a new dentist under.
[36:56.100 --> 36:57.520]  I have no idea what happened there,
[36:58.180 --> 37:02.320]  but it made me think about a story which I can get into later.
[37:02.560 --> 37:05.940]  So anyway, I got to meet a new dentist yesterday under a new name
[37:05.940 --> 37:07.680]  because my dental company is now something else.
[37:08.420 --> 37:12.000]  And they took an X-ray eventually when they figured out how to take X-rays
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.980]  at the place where they take X-rays all day, every day.
[37:15.160 --> 37:19.700]  And they were like, oh, yeah, it looks like when you had your root canal,
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.440]  maybe that sometimes there can be like a side channel that doesn't get seen.
[37:24.600 --> 37:25.560]  It wasn't showed up.
[37:25.720 --> 37:27.920]  And anyway, so you've got like a little infection there.
[37:28.500 --> 37:32.160]  So we'll just need to we'll just need to go in and take that out.
[37:32.200 --> 37:36.120]  And I go, please do, because this is like I'm an excruciating pain.
[37:36.280 --> 37:38.060]  And she's like, well, I can't.
[37:38.060 --> 37:41.020]  You know, it's you're going to have to go to the endodontist who did it last time
[37:41.020 --> 37:43.500]  because they have like a special equipment to get into this thing.
[37:43.500 --> 37:46.500]  And so best of luck.
[37:46.960 --> 37:48.320]  And so I called the endodontist.
[37:49.020 --> 37:50.820]  Eventually, there were a bunch of
[37:51.300 --> 37:53.820]  points of failure between these times.
[37:54.580 --> 37:59.540]  And when when I eventually convinced them to give me the correct endodontist,
[38:00.340 --> 38:02.300]  I argued that successfully.
[38:03.560 --> 38:06.120]  The endodontist was like, yeah, we can see you next Thursday.
[38:06.900 --> 38:08.900]  And I was like, boy, I'm in a lot of pain today.
[38:09.020 --> 38:10.320]  And they're like, yeah, cool.
[38:10.540 --> 38:13.040]  We'll hold on to that and we'll see you next Thursday.
[38:13.500 --> 38:17.840]  So I called every endodontist in Austin and no one can see me.
[38:17.980 --> 38:21.140]  Ironically, every endodontist in the city,
[38:21.480 --> 38:24.440]  in the 11th largest city of America, the Austin, Texas,
[38:24.940 --> 38:27.880]  every endodontist has an appointment next Thursday.
[38:29.340 --> 38:32.260]  Nothing between now and next Thursday.
[38:33.560 --> 38:37.700]  Probably 30 endodontists all are free next Thursday.
[38:38.760 --> 38:40.880]  Do you think that only on Thursdays?
[38:40.980 --> 38:43.140]  Very busy between now and then.
[38:43.140 --> 38:45.180]  Some of them, not all of them.
[38:46.880 --> 38:50.240]  So anyway, the pain was unbearable.
[38:51.120 --> 38:55.260]  I asked for pain meds, to which they refused to give me.
[38:55.620 --> 38:59.920]  So I am. But they did give me antibiotics and they swore that the antibiotics
[38:59.920 --> 39:02.320]  mixed with Motrin would help it go away.
[39:02.540 --> 39:06.820]  And so yesterday was one of the longest days of most painful days of my life.
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.000]  And eventually it did go away and I was able to get to sleep.
[39:11.020 --> 39:12.220]  And so far, so good this morning.
[39:12.220 --> 39:13.640]  Although it's tentative.
[39:13.960 --> 39:16.340]  But yeah, I got to get another root canal next Thursday.
[39:17.180 --> 39:21.160]  I got to re-root canal my rooted canal because they didn't root canal.
[39:21.240 --> 39:22.820]  The first five times weren't enough.
[39:23.260 --> 39:28.540]  So next Thursday, I'm getting my first and hopefully only root canal of 2022.
[39:28.860 --> 39:30.480]  Thought the other three were behind me.
[39:30.540 --> 39:33.220]  Thought the 13 months of hell, dental hell were behind me.
[39:33.260 --> 39:35.960]  But turns out they were it was it was just there was like a little
[39:35.960 --> 39:38.680]  little bomb waiting in my mouth to explode.
[39:38.780 --> 39:41.960]  At what point do you just pull them all out and get a completely fake set of teeth?
[39:42.220 --> 39:45.880]  I'm I, dude, I'm I've I don't know, soon.
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.480]  Fucking who needs teeth?
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.040]  I feel like you may be close to setting a record
[39:54.040 --> 39:56.800]  for the most root canals on a singular tooth.
[39:57.340 --> 39:59.720]  You have to be near it. Yeah.
[40:00.520 --> 40:03.080]  What is this? This is I don't even like this fucking tooth anymore.
[40:03.520 --> 40:09.180]  No, this would be I mean, one root canal that took five sessions, right?
[40:09.180 --> 40:13.500]  And then. So this will be this
[40:13.500 --> 40:17.140]  and this will be retreating that canal, so this will be the sixth time
[40:17.140 --> 40:19.780]  they've drilled into this tooth for this problem.
[40:20.380 --> 40:21.700]  Do you have a ranking of teeth?
[40:21.920 --> 40:22.980]  Do you have a favorite tooth?
[40:23.100 --> 40:25.360]  I have a least I have a least favorite tooth.
[40:25.440 --> 40:26.780]  I'll tell you that it was a bottom tier.
[40:27.880 --> 40:31.160]  Yeah, I will say on the bright side, one piece of good news.
[40:31.300 --> 40:33.540]  We haven't really talked about it, but one piece of good news.
[40:35.320 --> 40:37.560]  Guess who tested negative for COVID today?
[40:37.560 --> 40:38.780]  Finally. Yeah.
[40:40.440 --> 40:44.880]  Hey, 13 days straight testing positive with no symptoms.
[40:45.360 --> 40:48.840]  And this was an at home test or is this like at home test?
[40:48.860 --> 40:49.540]  I'm going to laugh to this.
[40:49.620 --> 40:51.420]  I'm going to leave and go get a test at Rooster Teeth.
[40:51.580 --> 40:54.280]  But yeah, finally, my first negative.
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.440]  I've been living in my spare bedroom for two weeks,
[40:57.960 --> 40:59.880]  not interacting with my girlfriend.
[41:01.740 --> 41:05.260]  Well, interacting with Millie, because she was also had it for a little bit.
[41:05.260 --> 41:08.260]  But she got better weeks ago or forever ago.
[41:08.580 --> 41:10.020]  So, yeah, as of today, I can.
[41:10.340 --> 41:11.640]  By the way, people don't give a shit about COVID.
[41:11.860 --> 41:14.240]  I told the dentist, I'm like, I'm testing positive for COVID,
[41:14.320 --> 41:14.980]  but I don't have symptoms.
[41:14.980 --> 41:15.960]  I haven't in over a week.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.460]  And they're like, we don't give a fuck. Come on in.
[41:17.600 --> 41:19.980]  So, wow. Yeah, that's interesting.
[41:20.220 --> 41:21.540]  And then in your mouth.
[41:22.240 --> 41:23.780]  Yeah, I know. That's what I was thinking, too.
[41:23.860 --> 41:25.040]  Where it is. Yeah.
[41:25.180 --> 41:28.360]  They were like, do you think that there's any connection to that?
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.360]  And and everybody on the planet only willing to see you in a future Thursday?
[41:32.560 --> 41:33.640]  Do you think there's any connection?
[41:33.640 --> 41:35.680]  I don't know. I don't know.
[41:35.940 --> 41:37.560]  I don't know. Maybe that's what did it.
[41:37.660 --> 41:39.400]  Maybe a little bit of COVID got in your tooth.
[41:39.540 --> 41:40.620]  So I googled that
[41:42.300 --> 41:44.920]  at five in the morning when I was in excruciating pain.
[41:45.400 --> 41:48.980]  And yeah, there's I read the Google has some people that are saying that.
[41:49.120 --> 41:51.260]  But then I talked to the dentist and the dentist was like, that's stupid.
[41:51.880 --> 41:54.640]  So imagine if that created a new variant.
[41:55.220 --> 41:59.260]  Yeah, the goddamn enamel cron.
[42:03.200 --> 42:05.120]  Well, that sucks. That's the worst.
[42:05.600 --> 42:06.580]  I know. No, it's great.
[42:06.620 --> 42:08.200]  I don't have COVID anymore. It's awesome.
[42:09.600 --> 42:11.100]  The other part sucks. Yeah.
[42:11.260 --> 42:13.400]  The other thing I know I'm just trying to be positive.
[42:14.140 --> 42:16.920]  Is there any I don't I don't understand how dentistry works.
[42:17.560 --> 42:19.860]  Why haven't you just pulled that tooth at this point?
[42:20.060 --> 42:21.620]  What is the reason for keeping it?
[42:21.640 --> 42:23.100]  Why are we holding on to this tooth?
[42:23.440 --> 42:26.320]  I assume I need it to chew and stuff.
[42:27.480 --> 42:30.540]  I feel like you certainly have enough of other teeth.
[42:30.660 --> 42:34.040]  I mean, I'd rather when in doubt, keep your teeth, I think.
[42:34.120 --> 42:36.780]  For sure. I think we've crossed the line of doubt.
[42:37.460 --> 42:39.640]  I guess that's right. I'd put the statement.
[42:39.940 --> 42:41.000]  I'll also be honest with you, man.
[42:41.180 --> 42:44.620]  I got I got a lot of time and money invested in this tooth.
[42:44.720 --> 42:45.580]  I'm not giving up on it.
[42:45.600 --> 42:47.740]  I'm not letting it throw in the tooth towel. Fuck no.
[42:48.380 --> 42:53.160]  I am I am bound and determined that this will be the only time I do this this year, though.
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.900]  Well, Andrew, do you have have you you seem to have very little experience with a dentist.
[42:58.220 --> 42:59.480]  Do you have your wisdom teeth and stuff?
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.260]  Yes, I do. I haven't had them removed.
[43:02.440 --> 43:05.000]  And they're fine. They didn't come in like all messed up.
[43:05.200 --> 43:07.760]  No. Yeah, well, I don't I don't. Yeah, I think I'm good.
[43:08.280 --> 43:11.820]  I'm actually I'm heavily relying on those wisdom teeth for the 20,000 words.
[43:11.960 --> 43:14.500]  I put a lot of effort, I banked on that wisdom specifically.
[43:14.940 --> 43:17.120]  Wisdom teeth is I'm going to make a mental note of that.
[43:17.300 --> 43:17.860]  That's the thing. There you go.
[43:18.520 --> 43:19.380]  All the different teeth.
[43:21.420 --> 43:23.200]  Now, what if I name my teeth?
[43:23.980 --> 43:25.460]  Can I can I credit each tooth?
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.260]  If the first if the first two, if the first 500 things you wrote,
[43:31.380 --> 43:35.600]  you write are sequential to this podcast, we'll know you were cheating
[43:35.600 --> 43:37.640]  and writing shit down now. But while the podcast was going.
[43:38.360 --> 43:40.500]  Oh, he'll have to mix them up in the spreadsheet to throw.
[43:40.780 --> 43:47.340]  Yeah, if he writes like he writes like cucumber bag taco breakfast tooth
[43:47.340 --> 43:53.540]  covid negative positive test, we're going to nobody root canal root canal
[43:55.100 --> 43:58.300]  canal. That's three things right there.
[43:59.900 --> 44:02.720]  Just think of all the compound words you can turn into three things.
[44:03.320 --> 44:03.820]  That's amazing.
[44:05.580 --> 44:08.700]  What would you say you're invested in this tooth?
[44:08.960 --> 44:12.500]  Is there any thought of if you pulled it, turning it into something else?
[44:13.540 --> 44:14.500]  You're a chain guy.
[44:14.980 --> 44:17.880]  Would you ever have like the tooth on a chain, like maybe a gold?
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.000]  Could you dip it in gold?
[44:19.380 --> 44:20.720]  What could you do with this tooth?
[44:21.160 --> 44:24.740]  If I were to have this tooth removed,
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.880]  what I would do is I would I would
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.260]  put it in a trebuchet and I would launch it to the moon.
[44:35.640 --> 44:38.760]  I want it as far away from me and this planet
[44:38.760 --> 44:42.480]  and our atmosphere and the gravity of Earth as possible.
[44:42.480 --> 44:46.360]  I would like to break through and launch it into deep space.
[44:46.480 --> 44:48.820]  And I would like it to float through eternity
[44:50.460 --> 44:53.340]  every day, getting further and further away from my mouth.
[44:54.660 --> 44:57.900]  You're either in my mouth or you are against my mouth.
[44:57.940 --> 45:00.240]  And if you are against my mouth, you better get as far
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.940]  the fuck away from my mouth as you can muster.
[45:03.040 --> 45:04.080]  And don't ever stop.
[45:04.560 --> 45:05.620]  It's not far enough.
[45:05.680 --> 45:08.920]  No matter how far you've traveled through the universe, it's not far enough away.
[45:09.020 --> 45:09.540]  Keep going.
[45:10.140 --> 45:12.200]  Now, outside of the things in your mouth,
[45:12.340 --> 45:15.020]  is there anything else against your mouth or is everything
[45:15.020 --> 45:17.060]  against your mouth currently in your mouth?
[45:17.460 --> 45:19.260]  There's nothing against my mouth right now.
[45:19.560 --> 45:22.380]  OK, I have a tooth and I are having a bit of a disagreement
[45:22.380 --> 45:25.840]  that's been going on for 15 months, but we're going to work it out
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.460]  through a lot of pain, a lot of drilling, a lot of discomfort,
[45:29.820 --> 45:34.680]  a lot of sweating, a lot of gripping the seat and praying that it did
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.700]  like waiting to raise my hand because it still hurts all that all the trauma.
[45:40.320 --> 45:44.760]  That I've endured over the last year and a half ahead of me next week.
[45:45.080 --> 45:46.540]  I'm supposed to go out of town this weekend.
[45:46.580 --> 45:47.240]  How the fuck am I?
[45:48.900 --> 45:51.800]  So are we going to have to move face on Thursday?
[45:53.260 --> 45:55.460]  No, it's at 730 in the morning.
[45:56.560 --> 45:57.320]  Great faces.
[45:57.700 --> 45:59.880]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[45:59.880 --> 46:03.980]  My tooth deal is 730 and I've done half of the podcasts
[46:03.980 --> 46:05.340]  I've done have been after a root canal.
[46:05.480 --> 46:07.080]  So I guess that's true.
[46:07.080 --> 46:09.020]  Are we recording normal time Thursday?
[46:09.080 --> 46:11.940]  I assume if Gavin can ask, are you around to record?
[46:12.100 --> 46:14.340]  I think so. OK, I'm excited.
[46:14.720 --> 46:17.060]  I mean, we got MVP two on the calendar.
[46:17.400 --> 46:18.480]  We got a second movie.
[46:18.860 --> 46:19.880]  We got some stuff on the calendar.
[46:19.940 --> 46:21.800]  I'm very looking forward to it.
[46:21.800 --> 46:22.580]  Yeah, we did some.
[46:22.980 --> 46:26.180]  So when does the supplemental piece that we recorded come out
[46:26.180 --> 46:27.480]  when we organize today?
[46:27.680 --> 46:29.660]  Oh, that's a great question.
[46:29.860 --> 46:31.580]  I don't I don't know what is that coming out.
[46:31.820 --> 46:33.160]  Hopefully it comes out before this.
[46:33.160 --> 46:38.980]  So people understand what goes into planning anything,
[46:38.980 --> 46:43.040]  which, by the way, I would like to say if the audience has watched that,
[46:43.260 --> 46:45.940]  I listen to that like 20, 25 minute little thing we did.
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.060]  That wasn't for content, right?
[46:51.080 --> 46:52.520]  That's just what it's like.
[46:52.680 --> 46:56.320]  We just decided to record because we were we had just been recording.
[46:56.420 --> 46:57.860]  But that's what it's like for Eric.
[46:57.920 --> 47:01.640]  I would say seven out of ten times he has to schedule anything for us.
[47:01.640 --> 47:03.360]  But Eric can weigh in on that.
[47:03.780 --> 47:05.120]  Yeah, by the time this is out.
[47:05.260 --> 47:09.000]  So this episode number 92, this will be out the first week of March.
[47:09.880 --> 47:12.760]  That supplemental piece will have come out after 91.
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.180]  So on the like the 25th, 26th.
[47:15.180 --> 47:16.700]  So you can you can listen to that now.
[47:17.300 --> 47:21.360]  Just know that we started rolling on that probably
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.580]  halfway through the conversation of trying to get that scheduled.
[47:25.820 --> 47:30.540]  So before what you hear, there's another 15 minutes
[47:30.540 --> 47:33.700]  of trying to get an answer and trying to get the schedule.
[47:34.140 --> 47:37.340]  So we just decided, I guess we'll just start rolling on this
[47:37.340 --> 47:41.060]  and see what happens halfway through trying to figure it out.
[47:41.540 --> 47:45.020]  Yeah. And that's and that like
[47:45.020 --> 47:49.540]  what happened just now was a very small piece of that where,
[47:50.200 --> 47:53.900]  hey, will you be here for next for Thursday when we do this episode?
[47:54.020 --> 47:56.000]  And Gavin just gave a maybe.
[47:58.640 --> 48:00.880]  But as established, a maybe is a yes.
[48:00.940 --> 48:06.460]  Just very strongly about the way today and tomorrow go will determine that.
[48:10.180 --> 48:13.520]  Is there any is there any way we can influence today to go?
[48:13.780 --> 48:15.860]  Well, like, well, you need help.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.920]  I'm kind of like I can be on set again.
[48:19.720 --> 48:20.680]  We can push it later.
[48:22.420 --> 48:23.600]  To guarantee that I'll be there.
[48:24.280 --> 48:25.720]  The recording? Yeah.
[48:26.340 --> 48:28.280]  For next Thursday? Yeah.
[48:28.620 --> 48:30.280]  For the 17th, you want to push it later?
[48:31.060 --> 48:33.420]  Well, if you if you want a definite answer.
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.780]  Yeah, I mean, we can push it later if you need to.
[48:36.360 --> 48:37.640]  Hold on. This Thursday.
[48:38.420 --> 48:39.360]  Right. This Thursday.
[48:39.420 --> 48:41.280]  Are you talking about the 10th or the 17th?
[48:41.280 --> 48:42.460]  I think we're talking the 10th here.
[48:42.560 --> 48:44.180]  We're not. We're talking this week, I assume.
[48:44.380 --> 48:47.220]  And not that we're talking about whatever the seven has this thing.
[48:47.660 --> 48:48.560]  That's the seven that it was.
[48:48.760 --> 48:49.540]  I thought it was the seven.
[48:49.540 --> 48:53.940]  Geoff said next Thursday is when he can get his tooth worked on.
[48:54.020 --> 48:55.940]  That's on me. That's hey, I haven't slept.
[48:56.120 --> 48:57.000]  That's on me. I missed that.
[48:57.060 --> 48:58.220]  I thought we're talking this Thursday.
[48:58.600 --> 49:00.040]  Don't don't use that as an excuse.
[49:00.040 --> 49:01.280]  You said you feel great.
[49:01.320 --> 49:02.440]  You feel sharper than ever.
[49:03.140 --> 49:05.540]  Yeah. You're not allowed to say, well, I didn't sleep.
[49:05.780 --> 49:07.260]  Listen, you're firing on all cylinders.
[49:07.740 --> 49:10.120]  This is a knife that is dulled quickly.
[49:10.780 --> 49:12.880]  This is a dull knife at this stage.
[49:14.220 --> 49:15.960]  We're slowly going through.
[49:16.440 --> 49:17.740]  I think that minute you did really.
[49:17.740 --> 49:24.600]  That minute Gavin strategically took the wind out of my sails at that minute is what that was.
[49:24.660 --> 49:26.080]  Right down the wind, right down sails.
[49:29.100 --> 49:30.580]  I was not ready for it.
[49:30.800 --> 49:33.460]  He made me sprint in a marathon and I got to regather.
[49:33.580 --> 49:34.560]  I've hit that wall.
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.340]  I've also found out is bailing on this weekend's Donkey Kong.
[49:40.140 --> 49:44.480]  What? Oh, that's not true.
[49:45.060 --> 49:45.940]  That's not Nick.
[49:46.040 --> 49:48.220]  Can you go ahead and isolate that for the soundboard?
[49:48.320 --> 49:49.680]  The what? No, we'll need that.
[49:49.820 --> 49:50.660]  That's a good one.
[49:54.040 --> 49:55.340]  OK, that's not true.
[49:55.560 --> 49:58.440]  I never this weekend is a no go.
[49:58.820 --> 49:59.900]  Cannot do this weekend.
[50:00.020 --> 50:00.940]  And that was established.
[50:01.180 --> 50:03.120]  So if I did say that, I think you misheard.
[50:03.460 --> 50:07.700]  I think I said the weekend after the one that that episode came out.
[50:08.220 --> 50:09.960]  Right. But that's it came out today.
[50:11.560 --> 50:12.800]  Yeah, the weekend after.
[50:12.800 --> 50:15.360]  So it would be not this weekend, the following weekend,
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.380]  the weekend after the episode is this weekend, the weekend.
[50:19.500 --> 50:21.160]  No, the weekend after.
[50:21.440 --> 50:23.280]  OK, the week of the episode.
[50:23.620 --> 50:26.580]  So you're doing so you are strategic in that.
[50:27.520 --> 50:30.300]  Yes, this is a weekend like I can't.
[50:30.380 --> 50:32.100]  There's some stuff can't do it.
[50:32.120 --> 50:32.980]  This week is busy, man.
[50:33.760 --> 50:34.240]  Established.
[50:34.660 --> 50:36.080]  So the following weekend.
[50:36.240 --> 50:38.720]  But then I think we have this exact same conversation
[50:38.720 --> 50:41.560]  and the next one we record and it is the same day.
[50:42.040 --> 50:45.220]  It's just more clear than your defense of being confused.
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.220]  I remember feeling confused after establishing that
[50:48.220 --> 50:50.800]  because I knew there was one weekend in February I couldn't do.
[50:51.300 --> 50:53.360]  But yeah, I'm not worried about that either.
[50:53.480 --> 50:54.920]  I think that'll be easy. I'm excited.
[50:55.160 --> 50:59.400]  And as a reminder, you're playing all the way to the end of Donkey Kong 64.
[50:59.660 --> 51:01.140]  All the way to the end. You have the credits.
[51:01.260 --> 51:03.100]  Can we. 44 hours to do.
[51:03.180 --> 51:04.140]  44 hours to do it.
[51:04.440 --> 51:05.640]  We're really OK. 44 hours.
[51:05.700 --> 51:06.280]  That's a great point.
[51:06.320 --> 51:07.300]  We're also really bad at.
[51:07.420 --> 51:10.580]  So if I win, you have to wear 64 pieces of clothing
[51:10.580 --> 51:12.040]  and an RT podcast.
[51:12.160 --> 51:13.280]  What happens if I lose?
[51:13.700 --> 51:15.020]  You have to eat 64 bananas.
[51:15.640 --> 51:17.300]  Oh, yeah. One every day.
[51:17.840 --> 51:20.180]  I have to eat a banana every day for 64 days.
[51:20.320 --> 51:20.960]  OK, thank you.
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.360]  Stakes have been reset.
[51:22.500 --> 51:23.240]  We know the schedule.
[51:23.960 --> 51:28.040]  I can't imagine what day 65 is going to be like for you.
[51:28.920 --> 51:31.820]  Like, will it be the best non-banana day of your life?
[51:31.900 --> 51:34.660]  Or will you be like, yeah, you know, I'm kind of used to bananas now.
[51:34.800 --> 51:36.140]  I'm kind of missing them. I think he'll miss them.
[51:36.700 --> 51:37.300]  I think so, too.
[51:37.320 --> 51:38.580]  I think he'll become a banana stan.
[51:39.100 --> 51:41.260]  I don't think I don't like the texture.
[51:41.640 --> 51:42.360]  The taste is OK.
[51:42.480 --> 51:44.320]  Dude, remember, he said bananas.
[51:44.400 --> 51:45.480]  He didn't say what kind of bananas.
[51:45.580 --> 51:48.340]  There are more than a thousand different variants of bananas.
[51:48.740 --> 51:49.280]  We did go there.
[51:49.620 --> 51:50.700]  It's like apples.
[51:50.860 --> 51:54.540]  People just don't realize they all everybody's all in on the Cavendish banana.
[51:54.780 --> 51:55.900]  I think it's Cavendish, right?
[51:56.180 --> 51:59.020]  But but there's like there's many different textures and styles
[51:59.020 --> 52:02.100]  and colors and shapes of banana, maybe not shapes,
[52:02.120 --> 52:04.260]  but the other parts for you to explore.
[52:06.440 --> 52:08.140]  What's your favorite banana shape?
[52:10.300 --> 52:11.900]  Apple. Would you
[52:11.900 --> 52:16.900]  would you enjoy a banana if it was shaped like an apple and had like a
[52:16.900 --> 52:19.240]  you peeled it in the same way?
[52:19.880 --> 52:20.440]  What do you mean?
[52:20.720 --> 52:23.600]  Like, it just looks like an apple, but everything else about it is a banana.
[52:24.220 --> 52:28.160]  Yeah. No, my issue with the banana isn't the visual of the banana.
[52:28.620 --> 52:29.400]  It's the texture.
[52:29.800 --> 52:32.140]  I actually think the visual of the banana is pretty good.
[52:32.140 --> 52:34.700]  I think it's a visually a pretty appealing fruit.
[52:34.940 --> 52:36.420]  I agree. It's fun to open.
[52:36.760 --> 52:38.940]  It is. I had a banana yesterday.
[52:39.020 --> 52:40.460]  It was fucking awesome.
[52:43.560 --> 52:44.840]  What's so funny about that?
[52:46.480 --> 52:48.240]  It's just a lot of passion.
[52:48.840 --> 52:50.540]  Yeah, well, it's soft, man.
[52:50.600 --> 52:55.920]  I can I can't if I look at if you make eye contact with my tooth in nose.
[52:57.980 --> 53:00.440]  I'm so bummed that you have to go through that again.
[53:00.440 --> 53:01.320]  Yeah, me too.
[53:01.640 --> 53:02.780]  It's the fucking worst.
[53:03.060 --> 53:04.520]  It's my own personal hell.
[53:04.860 --> 53:05.520]  It is really.
[53:05.860 --> 53:06.940]  I'm not even kidding.
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.680]  Like the worst thing that I can imagine.
[53:08.920 --> 53:13.420]  I felt such a sense of relief that be finally done with all of that nightmare,
[53:13.540 --> 53:18.120]  especially after the last after the last tooth, the last week, and I was pretty rough.
[53:20.240 --> 53:22.860]  And I thought, well, at least that was the last one.
[53:22.860 --> 53:24.940]  I can't yell because of the pain.
[53:25.080 --> 53:29.120]  But yeah, I'm going to go insane.
[53:29.700 --> 53:31.840]  This is I get I get that movie Joker now.
[53:34.120 --> 53:35.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:36.360 --> 53:39.560]  I don't know, I like I like enthused banana, Geoff.
[53:39.680 --> 53:42.360]  If this is that's a byproduct of this tooth issue.
[53:43.240 --> 53:44.820]  I'm always eating a banana.
[53:45.100 --> 53:49.180]  Well, I know, but it's a different your delivery of it was fucking awesome
[53:49.180 --> 53:52.740]  was like you looking out into a field or something like the grizzled
[53:52.740 --> 53:58.680]  a grizzled banana that is fucking like I got the reminiscing about the good old days
[53:58.680 --> 54:00.020]  like I had a banana the other day.
[54:00.060 --> 54:02.200]  I've got that thousand yard potassium stare.
[54:05.420 --> 54:08.320]  You guys know the phrase thousand yard stare comes from the military.
[54:08.620 --> 54:09.560]  Are you familiar with that phrase?
[54:10.320 --> 54:12.360]  I associate it with that, but I don't I don't.
[54:12.640 --> 54:14.980]  Yeah, it's like it's a it's a phrase that they say, like guys in the military
[54:14.980 --> 54:17.620]  who have killed people in action, who have been in battle,
[54:17.740 --> 54:19.380]  have what's called a thousand yard stare.
[54:19.680 --> 54:21.480]  Yeah, it is kind of see through things.
[54:21.940 --> 54:22.820]  That's fucking real.
[54:22.920 --> 54:24.340]  I know a lot of dudes in the army that had that.
[54:24.440 --> 54:25.980]  That is a yeah, I don't know.
[54:25.980 --> 54:29.200]  I don't know anybody who was in combat who didn't have that.
[54:29.700 --> 54:31.900]  Is it just a case of like when there's nothing else to think about?
[54:31.980 --> 54:35.080]  Your mind just goes back to that and you just stare off into the distance?
[54:35.280 --> 54:36.620]  I think it must be, right?
[54:36.720 --> 54:39.540]  Or it's like it's always I never really talked about it.
[54:39.680 --> 54:43.520]  Well, I had one friend who had it bad and I talked about it with him a little bit.
[54:43.580 --> 54:49.080]  But yeah, he was like he was a gunner on a helicopter in Panama
[54:50.600 --> 54:52.960]  and he in some incursion.
[54:53.080 --> 54:54.740]  And yeah, he was like he couldn't
[54:54.740 --> 54:56.280]  he would get choked up if he talked about it too much.
[54:56.380 --> 54:58.460]  But yeah, dude, if you just like idle time, they would just sit.
[54:58.640 --> 55:01.100]  And I can't imagine the horrors replaying through their minds.
[55:01.380 --> 55:05.800]  But, you know, this has to be the only time in the history of the world
[55:05.800 --> 55:09.060]  in which a person was expecting to hear a banana fact
[55:09.060 --> 55:12.160]  and instead was sideswiped by the horrors of war.
[55:12.520 --> 55:15.640]  Well, listen, listen, we don't talk about it a lot,
[55:15.680 --> 55:18.040]  but I spent five years in the United States Army.
[55:18.140 --> 55:20.420]  So I guess it's a part of my past.
[55:20.880 --> 55:22.360]  I just was not prepared for that.
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.360]  I was I was still thinking about the potassium stare and the banana peels.
[55:27.560 --> 55:29.220]  I was thinking Mario Kart.
[55:29.440 --> 55:31.380]  And you guys know, very real.
[55:31.760 --> 55:35.640]  Do you guys know where the origin of slipping on banana peels came from?
[55:36.100 --> 55:39.860]  No. So this is I have a faulty memory, so I'm going to be going off memory.
[55:40.020 --> 55:42.420]  But so I may be getting a few facts wrong.
[55:42.760 --> 55:46.520]  But I believe around the turn of the century,
[55:47.040 --> 55:48.780]  turn of the turn of the 19th century, 20th century,
[55:50.840 --> 55:54.600]  a littering was a huge fucking deal in New York.
[55:55.240 --> 55:56.800]  And people were just throw trash around.
[55:57.100 --> 56:00.820]  And I guess bananas were very popular because they were cheap and easy to come by.
[56:00.840 --> 56:01.980]  And you could carry them around.
[56:02.100 --> 56:05.120]  They had a handle and people were throwing fucking banana peels
[56:05.120 --> 56:06.320]  and trash all over the street.
[56:06.360 --> 56:09.460]  So they started to say, like, if you throw a banana peel on the ground,
[56:09.560 --> 56:11.840]  they're not slippery, but you could slip and break your leg.
[56:11.880 --> 56:14.180]  It was like a scare tactic to get people to stop littering.
[56:14.220 --> 56:16.220]  But they are slippery. Have you ever stood on one?
[56:16.220 --> 56:18.960]  Uh, no, maybe.
[56:19.140 --> 56:21.000]  I don't think I've ever. I don't think I've ever.
[56:21.280 --> 56:22.960]  I don't think I've ever slipped on a banana peel.
[56:24.400 --> 56:25.920]  Here we go. Here we go.
[56:26.060 --> 56:27.120]  I fucking got it right here.
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.940]  Hold on. Uh, hazard.
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.360]  OK. In comical context, banana peel is also part of a classic
[56:35.360 --> 56:37.740]  physical comedy slapstick visual gag.
[56:37.820 --> 56:39.260]  The slipping of the banana peel.
[56:39.400 --> 56:42.060]  The gag was already seen as classic in 1920s America.
[56:42.180 --> 56:44.160]  It is traced back to the late 19th century
[56:44.160 --> 56:47.700]  when banana peel waste was considered a public hazard in a number of American towns.
[56:48.160 --> 56:51.000]  Although banana peel slipping jokes date back to the 1850s,
[56:51.020 --> 56:53.520]  they became more popular beginning 1860s, where large scale
[56:53.520 --> 56:56.000]  importation of bananas made them more readily available.
[56:57.700 --> 56:58.940]  Slipping out of banana peels.
[57:01.140 --> 57:02.640]  Oh. I guess it was.
[57:02.780 --> 57:06.220]  It says slipping out of banana peel was at one point a real concern
[57:06.220 --> 57:09.000]  with municipal ordinances governing the disposal of the peel.
[57:09.260 --> 57:12.100]  Yeah. So I guess it is from a little bit of truth.
[57:12.100 --> 57:14.440]  Maybe that's why the caution wet sign is yellow.
[57:14.560 --> 57:15.640]  Think about that.
[57:23.900 --> 57:27.620]  I love. I love.
[57:28.940 --> 57:32.020]  Oh, well, take it out before banana peel jokes came into vogue.
[57:32.160 --> 57:34.660]  Orange peels and sometimes peach skins
[57:35.380 --> 57:38.520]  were generally seen as funny as well as dangerous as well.
[57:38.900 --> 57:40.140]  So it's just a fruit problem.
[57:40.660 --> 57:41.680]  It's a fruit problem.
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.100]  And no, it's a it's a fucking people are disgusting problem is what it is.
[57:46.160 --> 57:51.200]  People were littering in such droves that they had to do something about it.
[57:51.420 --> 57:52.420]  At least it's biodegradable.
[57:52.780 --> 57:53.340]  That's true.
[57:53.840 --> 57:55.980]  I was really expecting that to be a war story.
[57:56.640 --> 58:00.400]  I'm really like my reads for where these banana tails are going to go.
[58:00.760 --> 58:02.720]  Yeah, I have no sense of it.
[58:03.120 --> 58:04.360]  This isn't a bob for me.
[58:05.040 --> 58:08.600]  I had a terrible, terrible guidance on if we're going to horrors of war,
[58:08.600 --> 58:09.980]  actual fun banana facts.
[58:13.220 --> 58:15.960]  I don't think I have any more fun banana facts.
[58:16.540 --> 58:18.420]  Hold on. Is the banana the slipperiest fruit?
[58:19.240 --> 58:22.580]  It's definitely the most like it's the poster for slippery food.
[58:22.940 --> 58:25.780]  I mean, as as someone who worked in a supermarket,
[58:25.940 --> 58:28.620]  I watched a lot of old people eat it on grapes.
[58:30.480 --> 58:34.300]  It was like when I was at work at Waitrose,
[58:34.680 --> 58:38.320]  it was my number one area to check because
[58:38.600 --> 58:42.420]  one grape goes on the floor and an old an old lady will bite it.
[58:42.900 --> 58:47.040]  It was I was making a pass every like 10, 15 minutes under the grapes.
[58:47.420 --> 58:49.020]  Just making sure because people are animals.
[58:49.280 --> 58:50.900]  People, they're picking through the grapes.
[58:51.020 --> 58:51.980]  They eat them. They drop them.
[58:52.060 --> 58:52.680]  They don't give a shit.
[58:54.460 --> 58:55.600]  People go down.
[58:56.680 --> 58:59.460]  Did you guys know that bananas are radioactive?
[58:59.700 --> 59:02.620]  They contain small amounts of the isotope potassium-40.
[59:02.880 --> 59:03.920]  It's a banana fact.
[59:04.260 --> 59:05.160]  It is. Yeah.
[59:05.160 --> 59:08.580]  Well, I think when originally the 64 banana talk was happening,
[59:08.700 --> 59:10.500]  Gavin was scared I'd die from radiation.
[59:11.040 --> 59:13.460]  It says for it to be harmful.
[59:13.700 --> 59:17.620]  You'd need to eat close to 700 bananas a day for 80 years.
[59:18.980 --> 59:21.280]  Oh, damn. Better get to it.
[59:21.340 --> 59:23.520]  And we got another we got another bet, Andrew.
[59:24.560 --> 59:28.260]  I was about to say, can you imagine somebody who's like 30 years into it?
[59:32.900 --> 59:35.340]  We've been trying to get him to stop for 30 years,
[59:35.420 --> 59:38.700]  but he just will not stop eating 700 bananas a day.
[59:39.000 --> 59:40.200]  Dude, bananas cure depression.
[59:40.560 --> 59:44.300]  If somebody ate 700 bananas a day, they'd be the most mentally adjusted person on Earth.
[59:44.720 --> 59:48.020]  I mean, OK, if it kills you in 80 years, it's a pretty good life.
[59:48.140 --> 59:49.460]  It's a pretty good life. 80 years.
[59:49.620 --> 59:51.560]  I'd take 80 years. Guaranteed 80.
[59:52.660 --> 59:54.700]  Something taking 80 years to kill you.
[59:55.500 --> 59:56.680]  Like oxygen does that.
[59:56.680 --> 59:57.280]  Anything.
[59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.740]  If that's a good point.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.600]  If I was playing deal or no deal and the banker offered 80 years,
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.580]  I would take 80 years.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.660]  I'd be good with that. For life? For life.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.300]  Yeah. How long do you think you're going to live?
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.400]  Oh, man. How long do you plan on dying?
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.620]  It's 8 a.m.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.940]  How long do you plan on living?
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.720]  As long as humanly possible.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.580]  I don't know. There's factors. Yeah.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:20.720]  I'm going to live.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.940]  We've had this. We used to have this talk all the time back in the day.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.040]  Gavin wants to die someday. I don't.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.560]  I want to live forever.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.840]  I want to I want them to put my brain in something Ted Williams style
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.040]  and I upload my consciousness like that upload show.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.480]  I want to be I want to live for fucking ever.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.540]  And part of why I try so hard at my career
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.960]  is so that I can amass enough money to buy immortality someday.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.640]  And I'm not anywhere close, by the way.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.760]  Some people live so long they watch their kids die of old age.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.000]  And I think that's tragic.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.120]  I don't think I don't think that's how long a human should live.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.280]  What if I would just appreciate that if Millie lived one day longer than me.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.920]  Now, I wanted to live forever times like whatever.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.100]  I don't want her to die a day after me. I don't want her to die ever.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.800]  But I don't plan on outliving Millie.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.320]  I plan on her living the same genetics.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.840]  She's going to live just as long as I will.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.700]  It reminds me of why do you want to live so long?
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.740]  Because I'm because I'm curious about stuff.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.260]  I'm still in life is still fucking awesome, dude.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.900]  Yeah, if you put in 500 years, you'll be an old man for 420 years of it.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.220]  Who cares, dude? The Celtics are still going to be playing.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.700]  I still got basketball to watch.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.660]  I still got bananas to eat. They're soft.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.280]  I still got teeth to drill like I still got life to live.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.880]  I can I get enough.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:41.700]  I have enough enthusiasm and energy and curiosity to live 10 lives concurrently.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.420]  Dude, one is not going to be enough.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.320]  It reminds me of Colin Quinn had a heart attack.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.620]  He's like 60 or whatever at this point.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.000]  And he was like, yeah, I had a heart attack and I realized now I'm going to die.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.280]  Like up until this point, I was kind of on the fence if that was going to happen to me.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.100]  But now I feel pretty confidently one day I will die.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.540]  I appreciate your enthusiasm for living this.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.340]  And what's the point if you're not going to be excited about it?
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.140]  No, it's completely fair.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.880]  I'm excited about the next 50 years.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.680]  Do you know how many fucking Donkey Kong games are going to come out in the next
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.720]  500 years for you guys to do challenges on?
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.080]  What I do know is we need to wrap up the show so I can start writing words.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.340]  Now we're coming up on an hour.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.540]  I need all the time I can get that minute.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.460]  I mean, we should we should end this episode with a countdown.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.660]  Oh, OK, but then we got to we got to wait a little bit
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.580]  because we have we have to fill some time, so maybe we should do
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.780]  the outro and then we got to do the outro after the timer.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.600]  When do we do the timer?
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:39.820]  No, the outro.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.080]  Nine. You've got to do all the outro stuff first.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.280]  Hey, this is the outro.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.120]  Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.640]  Tune in next week for us.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.540]  It'll be 11 hours from now. 12 hours now.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.120]  Eight, seven, six.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.700]  We really appreciate you listening.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.680]  We liked it so much. We said eight twice.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.180]  That's three times. Six, five, four, three.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.100]  Love you bunches.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.240]  Don't forget to eat your bananas.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.580]  Potassium's cure depression.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.580]  Two, one, seven, six.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.460]  Why are we doing it again?
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.060]  Five, four, three, two, one. Go.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.860]  That's me. I don't know why I'm saying go.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.400]  I'm so dumb that I thought the audience would know
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.360]  when it's seven for me.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.120]  I was like, we got to time this exactly. It doesn't fucking matter.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.480]  You were trying to make it land on...
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.760]  Stop talking. It's over. It's done.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.600]  What are you doing? You counted down.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.620]  He's right. It's done.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.760]  All right, let's stop. Bye.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:39.380]  Hey, guys. Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.660]  The boys discuss proper flag etiquette.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.580]  Geoff finds a new e-bike to blow up.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.140]  Andrew doesn't understand Google Docs.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.940]  The list begins with Vin Diesel.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.760]  Discord has a closed loop G.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.520]  Pantin is moving his bed.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.660]  Gavin peed himself in front of a celebrity.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.480]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.420]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
