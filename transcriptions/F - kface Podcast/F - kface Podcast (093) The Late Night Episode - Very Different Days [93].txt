[00:15.040 --> 00:18.020]  Gav, you want to start five minutes early so we can be done five minutes sooner?
[00:18.300 --> 00:20.260]  Yeah, that's the stupidest idea ever.
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.180]  What a dumb... what a bunch of dumb idiots.
[00:26.040 --> 00:31.600]  What a dumb, mainly me, who I think is the reason...
[00:32.300 --> 00:37.960]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:38.540 --> 00:43.360]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.400]  And Gavin, you are correct. This was a terrible, terrible, terrible idea.
[00:50.060 --> 00:52.640]  Dude, episode 92 feels like a week ago.
[00:53.300 --> 00:57.400]  How have you guys been these last 13 hours? Andrew is delirious.
[00:57.840 --> 00:59.400]  I'm great. This is awesome.
[00:59.540 --> 01:00.820]  Did you get a sleep at all, Andrew?
[01:01.680 --> 01:03.180]  We can talk about that later.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.580]  I don't think I'm delirious. I'm just more the joy of...
[01:10.580 --> 01:14.500]  I don't think I've ever, without a doubt, heard Gavin be annoyed.
[01:14.840 --> 01:19.140]  Yes. Yes. Yes. We don't have to fake it.
[01:20.760 --> 01:22.640]  Gavin, you sound like you're in a bad mood.
[01:23.140 --> 01:29.120]  I'm in a bad mood. I'm in a shitty little shit mood.
[01:29.340 --> 01:31.720]  What do you attribute that to?
[01:31.720 --> 01:38.080]  Well, I've been filming all day and I get home from these little filming sessions.
[01:38.600 --> 01:42.560]  And let's be fair. I'm out of practice. I haven't been filming with Dan in like two years.
[01:42.980 --> 01:44.400]  We're hitting it hard. We're back at it.
[01:44.800 --> 01:52.060]  I got home about 9.30 and I ate food and I was falling asleep over my bowl.
[01:52.380 --> 01:59.360]  I was so tired. I thought, wow, I don't think I've been this tired so early in two years.
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.660]  This could be the night that I get an early night, reset my entire sleep system,
[02:05.320 --> 02:11.900]  and I'm just staring at this stupid calendar invite that's almost two hours away.
[02:12.060 --> 02:16.780]  And I'm just staying up, killing time, waiting for time to pass so I can do this.
[02:17.120 --> 02:20.220]  And then freaking go to bed so I can wake up early and do it again tomorrow.
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.160]  So why are we this time? I know why the premise of the early show.
[02:26.460 --> 02:28.640]  Because I thought it was really funny.
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.300]  Yeah, well, it is. For the audience, just in case you didn't listen to the last episode,
[02:35.360 --> 02:38.820]  we needed to cram a bunch of episodes in before Gavin went out of town.
[02:39.280 --> 02:45.120]  So we got into a fight and we ended up, for some reason, agreeing to record two episodes in one day.
[02:45.260 --> 02:49.540]  But one of them had to be early in the morning and the other one had to be at the end of the day.
[02:49.600 --> 02:53.240]  So we recorded one at 8 a.m. our time and then one at 11 p.m. on our time.
[02:53.340 --> 02:57.740]  And then we all worked full days, except for Andrew who had to write 20,000 things today.
[02:58.260 --> 03:00.560]  Also, Gavin, can I just commiserate with you?
[03:03.980 --> 03:09.280]  Today was my first COVID-free day, right? I tested negative finally.
[03:10.520 --> 03:13.380]  I haven't slept with my girlfriend in 14 days.
[03:13.980 --> 03:14.580]  In the same bed?
[03:14.940 --> 03:20.240]  Yeah, in the same bed as well. I'm not trying to talk like sex talk. I just mean I haven't been in the same room with her.
[03:20.700 --> 03:22.780]  We haven't spent any time...
[03:22.780 --> 03:25.760]  I know what you meant because if you meant sex, you would have said boned.
[03:25.760 --> 03:32.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I admit. I haven't slept in my own bed in like 14 days. I've been in a spare bedroom.
[03:32.700 --> 03:37.040]  And so tonight was the night and I just went to say goodnight to her and then she was like, come on, get in bed.
[03:37.080 --> 03:43.740]  And I was like, why wouldn't I love to? Instead, I'm going to go spend the next hour and a half with assholes.
[03:47.140 --> 03:51.700]  By the time I get to bed, she and Henry are going to be having a snoring contest and I'll just be like...
[03:53.740 --> 03:55.180]  Did the filming at least go well?
[03:55.180 --> 04:01.600]  Yeah, it went pretty well. Blew up a lot of capacitors and stuff. What's really annoying is that Dan went to sleep immediately.
[04:04.060 --> 04:08.180]  I was just kicking around. I open mail. That's how bored I was just waiting.
[04:09.520 --> 04:11.120]  What do you mean you open mail?
[04:11.700 --> 04:15.240]  I open mail like once every six to nine months. Just this big pile.
[04:15.840 --> 04:20.320]  Yeah, I just try and get through some of it. It's all trash. Like it's not for me. It's just garbage.
[04:20.680 --> 04:22.480]  There's nothing good in your mail pile?
[04:22.880 --> 04:26.480]  Occasionally, there's something that's actual mail, but mostly it's just spam and crap.
[04:26.680 --> 04:29.520]  Mr. Free, you are seven months late on paying this bill.
[04:30.180 --> 04:33.000]  He pays bills with post. I'm online.
[04:33.620 --> 04:39.180]  What was the best piece of mail you opened that you could talk about? Any good coupons? Any great expired coupons?
[04:39.220 --> 04:44.400]  I got a new card. A new card. One that expired about three months ago. So I can put that in my wallet.
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.280]  That's great.
[04:48.600 --> 04:53.460]  I got the flag today. I got the Boys of Zimmer flag arrived. Congratulations.
[04:54.280 --> 04:55.420]  Not the Algerian flag?
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.260]  Not the Algerian flag. Or the Albanian.
[04:58.900 --> 05:00.000]  Oh, Albanian flag?
[05:00.420 --> 05:01.520]  Yeah, that was Eric's.
[05:02.860 --> 05:09.500]  Although, I don't know. Is it technically a flag? Because if you hang it like a flag, it's position wrong.
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.020]  So is it still a flag?
[05:11.380 --> 05:11.680]  Yes.
[05:12.580 --> 05:12.860]  What do you mean?
[05:12.860 --> 05:15.880]  Okay. Well, I'm saying if you were to hang it like a flag...
[05:15.880 --> 05:18.620]  Just say yes. It doesn't matter. Yes, it's still a flag.
[05:19.580 --> 05:21.120]  I'm just... I didn't...
[05:21.120 --> 05:21.420]  Yes.
[05:21.560 --> 05:26.080]  Isn't it a banner? Okay. What's the difference between a banner and a flag? Are they the same?
[05:26.900 --> 05:28.880]  Well, now I gotta Google. Hold on.
[05:29.420 --> 05:30.220]  Just curious.
[05:31.100 --> 05:34.860]  I was watching the Lakers get their fucking asses kicked. Let me turn that off. Okay.
[05:37.360 --> 05:43.900]  Difference between a flag and a banner. This is... I'm doing this at 1130 at night.
[05:45.700 --> 05:47.060]  So don't give a shit.
[05:47.980 --> 05:50.840]  Andrew, you might be on to something, my friend.
[05:52.760 --> 05:58.720]  Flags are usually flown on a flagpole or at a 45 degree angle from the side of a structure.
[05:58.720 --> 06:05.560]  Banners have a pole sleeve hem on the top. The flag slips over the pole. Banners are displayed at a 90 degree angle.
[06:05.560 --> 06:07.280]  So we're selling banners. We've faced our flag.
[06:07.460 --> 06:08.340]  We're selling banners.
[06:08.640 --> 06:10.100]  We're not actually selling flags.
[06:10.260 --> 06:13.240]  So don't put this on a pole. Hang it from the side of your castle.
[06:13.540 --> 06:18.060]  Do not. You can only hang it from the top of the TD garden like it's a Blurrybirds number.
[06:19.360 --> 06:20.240]  45 degree?
[06:20.760 --> 06:21.060]  Yeah.
[06:21.420 --> 06:22.520]  Oh, the pole is 45.
[06:23.080 --> 06:23.300]  Yeah.
[06:23.640 --> 06:24.060]  Okay.
[06:24.420 --> 06:25.900]  It's like, who's got a wonky flag?
[06:25.900 --> 06:30.220]  I don't know when I should get into this list thing.
[06:30.260 --> 06:31.420]  Let's get into the-
[06:31.420 --> 06:32.200]  Well, hold on.
[06:32.400 --> 06:35.900]  Before we do that, though, I want to find out what Eric and Nick have been up to for the last day.
[06:36.200 --> 06:36.920]  That's a great question.
[06:37.680 --> 06:40.740]  I had face jam, so face jam. Nick also had face jam.
[06:40.940 --> 06:41.720]  That's all you did today?
[06:42.300 --> 06:45.380]  I mean, I had other meetings and stuff, but it was...
[06:45.380 --> 06:45.620]  Huh.
[06:46.060 --> 06:46.640]  Yeah, face jam.
[06:47.420 --> 06:50.300]  Decent. All right. Sweet. Oh, Nick said-
[06:50.300 --> 06:50.660]  Oh, yeah.
[06:51.080 --> 06:52.300]  Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
[06:53.900 --> 06:55.280]  I did something today.
[06:55.280 --> 06:56.220]  What did you do?
[06:56.380 --> 06:57.160]  Was it tooth related?
[06:57.780 --> 07:03.300]  Uh, no, no. Well, I did tell them that about- I had a- Today was a roller coaster of pain.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.260]  And, uh, I hit a real- I think you really don't want to hear- We were doing pleasantries earlier.
[07:09.540 --> 07:19.180]  I hit a, uh, I hit a low point today at about two in the afternoon where I wanted to, uh, knock my tooth out with an ice skate, like in Castaway.
[07:19.980 --> 07:22.800]  But, uh, I fucking fought through it.
[07:23.700 --> 07:29.420]  And then I was fine after that for a little while. It just, like, it came in waves. It just decided to be particularly painful for about a half hour.
[07:30.180 --> 07:37.940]  Uh, I went to the store today, now that I can leave the house again, and, uh, I, uh, I bought a new bicycle.
[07:38.740 --> 07:39.100]  What?
[07:39.820 --> 07:40.180]  Yeah.
[07:40.860 --> 07:42.100]  Just like a normal bike?
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.840]  Fuck no, dude. I bought a new e-bike.
[07:45.340 --> 07:47.180]  Okay. Another exploding battery bike.
[07:47.180 --> 07:52.100]  No, this one, it's not gonna explode. I spent- I spent enough money that it will never explode.
[07:52.480 --> 07:56.340]  And, uh, it was a ridiculous- I spent, like, refrigerator money on this thing.
[07:56.980 --> 07:57.280]  No.
[07:57.520 --> 08:01.480]  And, uh, and I don't get it till May. Till end of May, because of supply chain issues.
[08:01.760 --> 08:02.800]  But when I do get it-
[08:02.800 --> 08:02.860]  Did you buy it from Westel?
[08:03.760 --> 08:04.160]  Yeah.
[08:06.140 --> 08:06.540]  Uh.
[08:06.980 --> 08:07.960]  Sorry, Schmest- Schmel?
[08:08.620 --> 08:14.300]  Schmest-Schmel? No, I bought it from a company called Trek. Uh, and, uh, I, uh, yeah.
[08:14.300 --> 08:19.940]  But it's got, like, 140 mile range on it, and they swear to me it'll never break down. So.
[08:20.940 --> 08:22.640]  I don't know if they can make that guarantee.
[08:22.840 --> 08:28.260]  I said, fuck it, at thirty- at four- thirty-six- what? Forty-six years old, I deserve it.
[08:28.800 --> 08:36.720]  Especially all the- the hell that I've been going through with my other- I've been going through so much hell on my other e-bike, I lost ten years of my life somehow. For a minute there.
[08:36.720 --> 08:41.620]  At forty-six years old, I deserve to- I- this splurged a little bit.
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.200]  Most dudes buy, like, motorcycles or RVs or convertibles of this age.
[08:46.420 --> 08:48.440]  I spent convertible money on a bicycle.
[08:49.020 --> 08:52.500]  So what makes this bike so much better than the last one you had?
[08:52.760 --> 08:53.540]  Well-
[08:53.540 --> 08:55.140]  Outside of the fact it won't explode, apparently.
[08:55.140 --> 09:03.680]  It's got a- it's got a Bosch engine in it, uh, like, uh, that's way more powerful and way sturdier than the one I have.
[09:03.680 --> 09:09.500]  It's- the battery, uh, capacity is six times as large.
[09:10.080 --> 09:13.880]  Uh, it's carbon fiber, so it's lighter than my bike.
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.680]  And it's got, uh, like these top-of-the-line Shimano brakes.
[09:18.480 --> 09:20.980]  And, uh, really, really nice gear system.
[09:21.120 --> 09:23.100]  It's, uh, it's like top- everything top-of-the-line.
[09:23.660 --> 09:25.820]  So top-of-the-line that I can't have it for, like, five months.
[09:26.420 --> 09:27.480]  Are you excited?
[09:28.020 --> 09:31.620]  Yeah. Someday. I'm gonna ride this sh- I hope I still want it in five months.
[09:31.620 --> 09:34.180]  Well, I think- I think it will, because it's your gateway to happiness.
[09:34.480 --> 09:36.240]  It's gonna be my gateway to happiness. Yeah.
[09:36.920 --> 09:38.860]  So I just have to suffer through the other one.
[09:39.080 --> 09:40.380]  I can't wait to hear about the first trip.
[09:40.600 --> 09:41.340]  Same. Same.
[09:41.760 --> 09:43.160]  Something is gonna- Go ahead.
[09:43.400 --> 09:44.440]  You go ahead. How about that?
[09:44.820 --> 09:46.260]  No, I was just gonna say...
[09:46.260 --> 09:49.020]  That was- that was weird, there. You meant it, isn't it?
[09:49.300 --> 09:52.400]  That was an aggressively- aggressively courteous-
[09:52.400 --> 09:53.980]  That was doing, like, polite, but with confidence.
[09:54.640 --> 09:57.840]  Yeah. No, it didn't come across as confidence. It came across as aggression.
[09:57.840 --> 10:00.620]  It did not. It didn't come across as polite either.
[10:00.620 --> 10:02.460]  I've lost all my fluff.
[10:05.240 --> 10:09.360]  I don't even remember what I was gonna ask now. I was so taken aback by your-
[10:09.360 --> 10:11.680]  No, you go ahead. It was authoritative.
[10:12.120 --> 10:12.840]  That's what that was.
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.500]  You go.
[10:14.820 --> 10:17.380]  Because I don't remember. I genuinely don't remember what I was gonna ask.
[10:17.460 --> 10:19.640]  I genuinely don't remember what I was gonna say.
[10:23.340 --> 10:26.280]  Boy, did we f***ing face ourselves today.
[10:26.600 --> 10:28.480]  I know. What was I gonna say?
[10:28.520 --> 10:29.400]  Oh, delirious.
[10:29.760 --> 10:31.120]  Is this about the bike?
[10:31.480 --> 10:33.120]  Probably, I think I was gonna ask.
[10:33.300 --> 10:33.740]  Yeah, probably.
[10:34.340 --> 10:35.040]  First trip.
[10:35.080 --> 10:35.380]  Something about the bike.
[10:36.060 --> 10:37.380]  Oh, I remembered.
[10:37.660 --> 10:41.860]  Did we ever talk about Geoff's real bike that he got one time when I still lived with him?
[10:42.500 --> 10:43.760]  I don't think so.
[10:44.240 --> 10:46.080]  He went out and got a new bike.
[10:46.660 --> 10:48.420]  And, uh, he brought it back.
[10:48.540 --> 10:50.440]  And he was like, yeah, he was telling me about his bike.
[10:50.540 --> 10:51.800]  He's like, oh, nice new bike. Shiny.
[10:52.320 --> 10:57.800]  And I was like, huh, a bit on the nose with the, uh, the color scheme.
[10:57.920 --> 10:58.780]  Black and green, right?
[10:58.780 --> 10:59.440]  Achievement Hunter.
[10:59.780 --> 11:03.720]  And Geoff was like, huh.
[11:04.160 --> 11:05.340]  And he just stared at it.
[11:05.380 --> 11:07.020]  It was just like, oh, shit.
[11:08.500 --> 11:10.960]  And, uh, that was the last time I rode that bike.
[11:11.920 --> 11:15.000]  After a few years, I gave it away.
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.440]  It was like an 800 Tola Achievement Hunter bike, basically.
[11:19.540 --> 11:23.320]  After I saw it, I could never get on it again.
[11:23.460 --> 11:26.640]  It was so goddamn offensively on the nose.
[11:26.640 --> 11:31.340]  I looked like I was driving a billboard for my fucking website around.
[11:31.360 --> 11:33.220]  Took him a thousand yard stand.
[11:33.540 --> 11:34.280]  Straight on the bike.
[11:36.860 --> 11:38.900]  That was a nice bike, too.
[11:39.260 --> 11:40.340]  Probably still in there somewhere.
[11:40.780 --> 11:42.360]  What color is this bike that you just bought?
[11:42.500 --> 11:42.840]  You know?
[11:43.060 --> 11:43.400]  Yeah.
[11:44.060 --> 11:44.920]  You didn't do it again, did you?
[11:45.280 --> 11:45.560]  Yeah.
[11:46.660 --> 11:48.540]  It's green with black accents.
[11:49.020 --> 11:50.920]  No, no, no.
[11:50.960 --> 11:52.620]  It's like a, kind of like a gunmetal.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.300]  Like a carbon fiber color.
[11:54.460 --> 11:55.440]  It's kind of like a grayish.
[11:56.020 --> 11:57.020]  Oh, that sounds cool.
[11:57.180 --> 11:57.880]  Yeah, it's nice.
[11:57.960 --> 11:59.800]  I think gunmetal might be on my list.
[12:03.560 --> 12:04.380]  That's a thing.
[12:05.220 --> 12:06.440]  That is a thing.
[12:06.600 --> 12:09.740]  Alright, so we've shot the shit for...
[12:11.100 --> 12:12.520]  We can keep shooting.
[12:12.980 --> 12:14.300]  I think it's okay to keep shooting.
[12:14.520 --> 12:15.720]  You're not still adding to it, are you?
[12:16.860 --> 12:20.400]  I may have added... what did I add?
[12:21.380 --> 12:22.580]  You said, Geoff said...
[12:23.580 --> 12:24.920]  I gotta scroll for a minute.
[12:24.920 --> 12:27.020]  You said, Geoff said...
[12:27.020 --> 12:27.440]  Bosch.
[12:27.940 --> 12:29.140]  Geoff said Bosch.
[12:29.400 --> 12:31.980]  And that's the name of a TV show on Amazon.
[12:32.220 --> 12:32.680]  That's a thing.
[12:32.880 --> 12:33.660]  I forgot about that.
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.180]  You're spelling it without a C?
[12:36.180 --> 12:38.020]  Yeah, well, I'm just spelling the name of the show.
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.080]  It just made me... hearing Bosch made me think of...
[12:40.080 --> 12:42.340]  But you could also put in Bosch, like the company.
[12:42.700 --> 12:44.200]  Oh, yeah, I guess I could.
[12:44.320 --> 12:45.220]  I just thought of the show.
[12:45.780 --> 12:46.260]  Thanks, Gavin.
[12:46.860 --> 12:47.720]  Add to the list.
[12:49.880 --> 12:51.340]  That's my new bike someday.
[12:51.920 --> 12:53.340]  Oh, damn.
[12:53.640 --> 12:54.100]  Pretty, huh?
[12:55.480 --> 12:58.060]  So, yeah, we've gone through what we've all been doing.
[12:58.180 --> 13:00.860]  Andrew, how was your last 14 hours?
[13:01.460 --> 13:04.540]  Yeah, because you couldn't... you didn't sleep last night.
[13:04.700 --> 13:08.360]  Because you were scared you were gonna oversleep.
[13:08.560 --> 13:10.280]  Yeah, and miss the morning podcast.
[13:10.340 --> 13:12.340]  So, you've just been up for like 400 hours.
[13:12.640 --> 13:15.040]  So, I'm gonna... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna copy and paste this.
[13:15.180 --> 13:19.500]  Unfortunately, what I use, the numbers do not come with the document.
[13:19.780 --> 13:22.460]  I'd have to, like, export the document, I think.
[13:22.460 --> 13:24.060]  But I thought you used a Google Doc.
[13:24.520 --> 13:25.500]  We can see numbers on it.
[13:25.580 --> 13:27.960]  No, no, I didn't end up using a Google Doc.
[13:28.160 --> 13:30.080]  I did something else.
[13:30.360 --> 13:30.400]  Why?
[13:31.280 --> 13:32.100]  Eric's already mad.
[13:32.380 --> 13:33.460]  Because I could...
[13:34.100 --> 13:35.300]  Okay, this is why.
[13:35.540 --> 13:39.740]  When I hit enter on this one, it goes to the next number automatically.
[13:39.900 --> 13:40.640]  It already writes it.
[13:40.780 --> 13:41.320]  That's what you want.
[13:41.360 --> 13:43.080]  So, I figured that'd be... that's what I want.
[13:43.420 --> 13:45.200]  And that's... I figured would be a big time saver.
[13:45.300 --> 13:47.700]  So, that's why I did it on this and not the Google Doc, I don't think.
[13:47.800 --> 13:48.940]  That's what Google Doc can do.
[13:49.180 --> 13:49.940]  It's just a list.
[13:50.240 --> 13:50.960]  You just start a list.
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.540]  Well, wait, wait a second.
[13:52.600 --> 13:54.220]  How do I... let me go back to it.
[13:54.340 --> 13:55.740]  Let me go back to the one I made earlier.
[13:56.460 --> 13:57.180]  Titled spreadsheet.
[13:57.500 --> 13:58.300]  He's gonna delete it.
[13:58.480 --> 13:59.740]  No, I'm not gonna delete it.
[13:59.940 --> 14:02.160]  So, I have Vin Diesel, chimpanzee, spelled with a J.
[14:02.300 --> 14:02.960]  Let's try this.
[14:03.640 --> 14:04.340]  What's a thing?
[14:04.680 --> 14:05.520]  Somebody name a thing.
[14:05.880 --> 14:06.140]  Banana.
[14:06.580 --> 14:06.820]  Banana.
[14:07.080 --> 14:08.440]  Okay, well, my computer has to load.
[14:08.920 --> 14:10.020]  Oh, my God!
[14:10.580 --> 14:11.480]  Okay, here we go.
[14:12.120 --> 14:13.820]  B-A-N-A-N-A.
[14:13.940 --> 14:16.120]  Eric and Nick are going at it in the chat with things.
[14:16.560 --> 14:18.840]  We've seen dog, rat, mouse, cat, sunglasses.
[14:19.240 --> 14:19.500]  Okay.
[14:19.500 --> 14:22.020]  Okay, this was... listen.
[14:22.660 --> 14:23.740]  That's my mistake.
[14:24.280 --> 14:25.260]  That is my mistake.
[14:25.440 --> 14:27.160]  I didn't know the spreadsheet worked that way.
[14:27.500 --> 14:29.560]  Oh, my... we told you!
[14:30.040 --> 14:32.180]  It was... no, you told me in the blitz.
[14:32.500 --> 14:34.840]  You told me when I was blitzed that I was caught off guard.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.560]  Eric, did you tell him?
[14:36.780 --> 14:43.520]  100% said what to do, what to click, how to do it, and what the expectation was.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.680]  What was very early for me.
[14:45.880 --> 14:48.820]  Eric was also like, let's be very clear.
[14:48.820 --> 14:49.960]  I remember that part.
[14:50.040 --> 14:52.740]  I'm going to over-explain this so there's no confusion.
[14:53.380 --> 14:58.420]  Because it's not over-explaining on this fucking show.
[14:58.600 --> 15:01.960]  It's explaining the regulation amount.
[15:03.200 --> 15:05.340]  What if I screenshot this?
[15:05.960 --> 15:09.740]  Copy and paste it, and it will insert new numbers for you, maybe.
[15:10.120 --> 15:10.440]  Okay.
[15:10.900 --> 15:11.700]  How would I do that?
[15:11.760 --> 15:12.140]  What do you mean?
[15:12.700 --> 15:13.260]  Copy...
[15:13.920 --> 15:15.100]  Yeah, I understand.
[15:15.220 --> 15:16.380]  Copy and paste what to where?
[15:16.380 --> 15:17.560]  To the...
[15:19.080 --> 15:20.640]  I don't think it would make numbers.
[15:20.740 --> 15:22.720]  I think it would just be one giant thing if I moved it to the spreadsheet.
[15:22.980 --> 15:24.200]  We're just going to copy and paste.
[15:24.880 --> 15:25.860]  We're going to start here.
[15:26.280 --> 15:28.220]  We'll do my first 40.
[15:28.640 --> 15:29.560]  You can tell me what you think.
[15:30.020 --> 15:31.360]  Tell me what you think of this first 40.
[15:31.480 --> 15:34.440]  40 out of 20,000.
[15:34.620 --> 15:37.400]  So we're going to do 20,000 in increments of 40.
[15:37.540 --> 15:37.980]  Here we go.
[15:38.180 --> 15:38.780]  This is 40.
[15:39.300 --> 15:39.580]  Oh.
[15:39.840 --> 15:40.540]  This is the first 40.
[15:40.720 --> 15:42.660]  Okay, it seems to be...
[15:42.660 --> 15:43.880]  We started with Vin Diesel.
[15:44.440 --> 15:45.440]  These are Vin Diesel movies.
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.200]  Vin Diesel.
[15:46.200 --> 15:48.780]  I felt like I did pretty good with Vin Diesel movies.
[15:48.940 --> 15:51.560]  I felt like I stretched Vin Diesel pretty far.
[15:51.760 --> 15:57.040]  Vin Diesel, Triple X, Knockaround Guy, Saving Private Ryan, Triple X 2.
[15:57.200 --> 15:58.920]  You went back to Triple X. I like it.
[15:59.020 --> 16:01.160]  After two movies, you're back in Triple X.
[16:01.540 --> 16:02.660]  He's just going in order.
[16:03.000 --> 16:03.440]  I think...
[16:04.020 --> 16:06.960]  He fucking did MTV Movie Awards.
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.640]  That's a Vin Diesel thing.
[16:10.260 --> 16:11.580]  Vin Diesel's connected to the agency.
[16:11.580 --> 16:12.020]  Ages Wing.
[16:12.120 --> 16:13.360]  You're doing video games too?
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.060]  Did he voice act?
[16:15.220 --> 16:17.020]  This is what happened.
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.740]  You can't just paste his IMDB.
[16:20.200 --> 16:20.800]  No, I didn't.
[16:20.860 --> 16:23.380]  I wrote all of the Vin Diesels from memory.
[16:23.540 --> 16:24.420]  Wow, I'm impressed.
[16:24.960 --> 16:26.520]  All Vin Diesel things from memory.
[16:26.540 --> 16:30.120]  So you remembered something called 3-on-3 freestyle from memory.
[16:30.260 --> 16:30.900]  No, listen.
[16:31.080 --> 16:32.060]  This is what happened.
[16:32.580 --> 16:33.420]  We're gonna get there.
[16:33.580 --> 16:37.320]  So I remembered up until Fast and Furious.
[16:37.700 --> 16:38.700]  Because there's two of those.
[16:39.560 --> 16:41.200]  There's ten of them.
[16:41.520 --> 16:42.460]  So there's a bunch of them.
[16:42.460 --> 16:46.640]  But I couldn't remember the subtitle for the video game.
[16:47.100 --> 16:49.980]  So I went into... I own it though.
[16:50.200 --> 16:52.500]  So I open up my games library.
[16:53.140 --> 16:58.980]  And all of the next 700 are all the games in my digital games library for Xbox.
[16:59.440 --> 17:00.240]  That's what these all are.
[17:00.320 --> 17:03.080]  3-on-3 Freestyle, 6180 in the Moon, Nine Monkeys of Shaolin.
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.460]  Freshly Frosted, Prototype, Ages Wing, Agatha Christie, The ABC Murders.
[17:09.060 --> 17:10.980]  Because I figured... I'm not Googling.
[17:10.980 --> 17:12.800]  I'm not breaking that rule.
[17:13.020 --> 17:18.560]  And I didn't think it was any different than me going into a library and looking at titles.
[17:18.680 --> 17:20.200]  Age of Booty is actually a good game, Eric.
[17:20.380 --> 17:21.860]  It's a top-down pirate game.
[17:22.340 --> 17:23.220]  It was actually developed in Austin.
[17:23.240 --> 17:23.820]  Yeah, it's pretty popular.
[17:24.280 --> 17:24.380]  Yeah.
[17:25.940 --> 17:26.980]  So the next...
[17:27.980 --> 17:29.200]  How do I...
[17:29.200 --> 17:31.000]  What was that? 45?
[17:32.460 --> 17:34.380]  Well, I don't know because there's no numbers on it.
[17:34.820 --> 17:35.260]  Where are we at?
[17:35.320 --> 17:37.560]  Alan Wake's American Nightmare was 40.
[17:37.560 --> 17:41.680]  We have 19,960 to go.
[17:41.760 --> 17:45.300]  There's a limit on Discord for how many characters you can put in a message.
[17:45.760 --> 17:46.820]  So let's go...
[17:46.820 --> 17:48.980]  If only we had a live document we could all look at.
[17:49.720 --> 17:50.960]  Let's try to go 100.
[17:51.440 --> 17:53.420]  If only we'd set the expectation clearly.
[17:53.800 --> 17:56.480]  Let's put 100. Bam! There we go.
[17:56.600 --> 17:57.480]  Now we're at 100.
[17:57.640 --> 17:58.920]  It's just all of your games.
[17:59.900 --> 18:01.900]  This is 100 right here.
[18:01.960 --> 18:02.240]  Okay.
[18:02.480 --> 18:04.400]  You got Beyond Good and Evil. You got Bioshock.
[18:04.400 --> 18:08.180]  We're at B. We've gone from A to Borderlands.
[18:09.900 --> 18:13.860]  But you've got Back 4 Blood, Banjo-Kazooie, Nuts and Bolts in the same line.
[18:14.420 --> 18:15.840]  Astroneer, Captain Spirit...
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.280]  Wait, wait. What's Banjo-Kazooie? What's Najotooie?
[18:19.440 --> 18:21.240]  Give me a second. Okay, well, listen.
[18:21.560 --> 18:23.360]  There's some imperfections in this list.
[18:24.300 --> 18:25.460]  There's some spelling errors.
[18:25.700 --> 18:27.120]  Is this supposed to be Banjo-Tooie?
[18:27.640 --> 18:28.440]  Banjo-Tooie.
[18:29.020 --> 18:30.740]  Where is it? Yeah, it is.
[18:30.820 --> 18:32.220]  It looks like Najotooie.
[18:32.220 --> 18:34.400]  So now we've gone to the next 100.
[18:34.540 --> 18:35.680]  This is 100 more games.
[18:37.480 --> 18:37.920]  Now...
[18:37.920 --> 18:38.600]  Eric's wants out.
[18:41.020 --> 18:43.080]  There's a game called Donut County.
[18:43.700 --> 18:46.580]  It's a great game. It's reverse Katamari.
[18:47.080 --> 18:47.980]  It's a great game.
[18:49.480 --> 18:51.320]  No, this is... Jack's gonna love this.
[18:51.540 --> 18:55.200]  He's gonna think it's great. I can't wait to see Jack's view of this list.
[18:55.760 --> 18:57.320]  So, at this point...
[18:57.320 --> 18:57.680]  Demon's Souls.
[18:57.960 --> 19:00.720]  Well, that's PlayStation, right? Or was that on Xbox?
[19:00.720 --> 19:02.240]  Are you exclusive Xboxer?
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.180]  I was just, yeah, mainly Xbox.
[19:04.680 --> 19:06.940]  So at this point, this is where we encountered an issue.
[19:07.080 --> 19:08.780]  This is when I fell asleep at my desk.
[19:09.220 --> 19:12.220]  This was a great fall in the list.
[19:12.440 --> 19:25.060]  I may have greatly overestimated the time it takes to both write things as well as doing it on no sleep.
[19:26.140 --> 19:27.720]  So this is the list.
[19:28.340 --> 19:30.580]  The list doesn't stop there.
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.440]  We still got...
[19:33.440 --> 19:35.700]  How many things do you think I named?
[19:36.440 --> 19:37.620]  Out of 20,000, how many?
[19:38.020 --> 19:41.160]  At any point, were you just sat there thinking of things, though?
[19:41.580 --> 19:42.860]  Yes. Absolutely.
[19:43.320 --> 19:44.800]  I don't think you made it to 1,000.
[19:45.140 --> 19:50.880]  I think you named 640 things.
[19:51.620 --> 19:54.460]  Well, here's another 100, so we're at 300 at this point.
[19:56.920 --> 19:58.780]  Just ignoring Nick and Eric.
[20:00.280 --> 20:04.420]  NHL 16, NHL 17, NHL 18.
[20:04.960 --> 20:06.920]  Final Fantasy 1 through 13.
[20:07.200 --> 20:08.380]  But here's the thing, right?
[20:08.560 --> 20:17.260]  You may only own NHL 16 through 21, but there were surely NHL games way before that that you could have just put in.
[20:17.980 --> 20:20.820]  Yeah, so there were times where I knew there were more.
[20:20.960 --> 20:24.440]  That happens a lot, but I couldn't remember their names and I didn't want to Google it.
[20:24.440 --> 20:26.020]  I felt that was against the competition.
[20:27.600 --> 20:30.440]  You've got Doom and then next to it you've got Doom.
[20:31.180 --> 20:31.920]  Is that what that means?
[20:32.700 --> 20:35.700]  No, I didn't include the movie because I'm a fucking idiot.
[20:35.920 --> 20:38.140]  That's the reboot of Doom was called Doom.
[20:38.660 --> 20:40.260]  But we talked about this, Andrew.
[20:40.260 --> 20:40.980]  Yeah, we did.
[20:41.160 --> 20:45.040]  You have to have a bracket, you have to have parentheses explaining the difference.
[20:45.140 --> 20:47.960]  Otherwise you could have just written Doom, Doom, Doom as three different things.
[20:48.160 --> 20:50.800]  Well, I figured we clarified in this moment that we were all good.
[20:50.880 --> 20:52.600]  It didn't need the bracket. I didn't have a lot of time.
[20:52.600 --> 20:56.580]  I figured here's another hundred for you to peruse.
[20:56.780 --> 21:00.120]  It's got Final Fantasy 2, 1 through 13.
[21:00.720 --> 21:04.860]  I can tell that he wrote... I think there will be people who go,
[21:05.020 --> 21:06.500]  Oh, I think he just copied and pasted this.
[21:06.700 --> 21:13.960]  Look at Just Cause. Just Cause, Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3, Just Cause 4.
[21:13.960 --> 21:14.240]  Ah!
[21:19.260 --> 21:23.480]  This is amazing. We gotta post this list online somewhere.
[21:24.500 --> 21:29.860]  So let me analyze. That's a game pass game. Very meditative.
[21:30.200 --> 21:36.400]  We still have to get you to... no matter how many you did, you still have to read it out loud so we can release it at the time of the final.
[21:36.420 --> 21:42.900]  The Just Cause happened. That was a fuck you to all the people that think I made up the not knowing, the shift key and the caps lock thing.
[21:42.900 --> 21:49.680]  That is the exact issue I've talked about, where I mishit when it was supposed to be up and when it was supposed to be down.
[21:50.920 --> 21:53.280]  Kingdom for Keflings. I forgot about that game.
[21:53.660 --> 21:56.120]  So here we go, let's throw another hundred in here.
[21:56.840 --> 21:58.780]  Well, that's a lot of Mega Man.
[21:59.600 --> 22:00.660]  That's a lot of Mega Man.
[22:00.880 --> 22:07.060]  A lot of Metal Gear Solid, a lot of Mortal Kombat. Oh, God. NBA...
[22:08.200 --> 22:09.760]  2K11 stops at 16.
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.660]  In 2016, you switched from NBA to NHL games.
[22:24.120 --> 22:25.460]  Oh, this is amazing.
[22:26.480 --> 22:28.380]  What else you got? What else you got, buddy?
[22:28.640 --> 22:31.600]  Okay, we're moving in, we're moving into 600. I'm sorry, this is taking...
[22:31.600 --> 22:34.940]  I thought it would be the numbers would copy and paste. With this, it does not.
[22:35.240 --> 22:37.760]  We're going in another hundred at a time.
[22:37.760 --> 22:41.100]  100 more things that I named that are things.
[22:43.740 --> 22:47.500]  NHL02 to NHL20. What was the other one again? Was it not NHL?
[22:48.620 --> 22:50.640]  Oh, did I double down on NHL?
[22:50.720 --> 22:52.080]  Oh, Andrew, you did.
[22:52.960 --> 22:55.300]  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
[22:55.300 --> 22:58.100]  Okay, so we can subtract...
[22:58.100 --> 23:01.460]  We're taking out a doom and five NHL games.
[23:01.780 --> 23:04.100]  No, no, the doom is fine because they're different things.
[23:04.100 --> 23:05.500]  You got overcooked in there twice.
[23:06.440 --> 23:07.220]  Where's overcooked?
[23:08.380 --> 23:09.700]  Look at overcooked!
[23:10.360 --> 23:12.360]  I think you meant overcooked two, but you didn't put two.
[23:12.360 --> 23:15.060]  I did, I did. I forgot the two on overcooked two.
[23:15.240 --> 23:15.940]  Strike one of those.
[23:16.820 --> 23:19.260]  No, we don't need to strike it, it's just clarified.
[23:19.580 --> 23:21.160]  We got minus five right now.
[23:21.220 --> 23:22.420]  Can somebody just remember?
[23:22.620 --> 23:30.140]  When Andrew has to read this list and we release it, it's just going to be Andrew saying names of video games only.
[23:30.140 --> 23:33.500]  I didn't even think that he could get...
[23:33.500 --> 23:37.060]  He could probably get close to 20,000 in his own video game collection.
[23:37.580 --> 23:39.880]  No, I went through my entire video game collection.
[23:40.060 --> 23:42.380]  We're coming up on the end of the video games.
[23:42.760 --> 23:45.320]  Drop another hundred in here for you.
[23:45.600 --> 23:47.600]  We got some more coming at you.
[23:47.780 --> 23:48.700]  Some more hot games.
[23:48.840 --> 23:50.700]  Sniper Elite, through four.
[23:51.400 --> 23:52.780]  Solitaire, classic game.
[23:52.940 --> 23:54.120]  Who doesn't love Solitaire?
[23:54.680 --> 23:56.320]  Oh my god, Space Jam.
[23:57.180 --> 23:57.400]  Thanks, man.
[23:58.340 --> 23:59.240]  Yeah, of course.
[24:00.580 --> 24:01.400]  Great game.
[24:01.840 --> 24:04.100]  Saints Row Get Out of Hell, is that a separate game?
[24:06.240 --> 24:08.560]  Yeah, it is. It was a DLC side game.
[24:09.080 --> 24:09.820]  I thought it was just DLC.
[24:10.280 --> 24:13.760]  It had its own icon, so I'm assuming it's its own thing.
[24:14.020 --> 24:15.100]  DLC is a thing, that's a good point.
[24:16.040 --> 24:18.120]  We're not listing games here, we're listing things.
[24:18.600 --> 24:18.760]  Yeah.
[24:19.500 --> 24:22.020]  Okay, so we're almost... wow, I had more games.
[24:22.080 --> 24:25.260]  So we got like a hundred more games and then we've gone out of game territory.
[24:26.700 --> 24:29.840]  I'm really excited to get to just the things you're thinking of.
[24:31.060 --> 24:35.240]  So that's where it becomes difficult because I fell asleep, I passed out.
[24:35.440 --> 24:36.580]  How long were you asleep for?
[24:37.340 --> 24:38.600]  About five hours.
[24:39.240 --> 24:40.560]  At your desk?
[24:40.980 --> 24:43.220]  I fell asleep at my desk for five hours.
[24:43.220 --> 24:43.740]  Like head on the desk?
[24:43.880 --> 24:46.020]  Like head on the desk for five hours.
[24:46.380 --> 24:48.360]  I woke up, I used the bathroom.
[24:48.540 --> 24:49.400]  We had such different days.
[24:50.340 --> 24:54.660]  Like you finished the test early and the teacher told you to put your head on your desk and be quiet.
[24:55.300 --> 24:58.280]  So I was cruising and I thought, you know what?
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.200]  I shut down. I just shut down. I don't even remember falling asleep.
[25:02.260 --> 25:02.460]  Five hours!
[25:02.840 --> 25:10.020]  But I woke up five hours later, got a drink, used the bathroom, fell back asleep for three more hours.
[25:10.420 --> 25:12.520]  It really ate into my clock.
[25:13.900 --> 25:17.860]  So okay, so that's five hours plus three hours.
[25:18.640 --> 25:19.060]  Eight hours.
[25:19.260 --> 25:19.820]  What was the total?
[25:20.560 --> 25:21.520]  The total was 13.
[25:22.180 --> 25:23.840]  I think it was like 14 hours.
[25:24.180 --> 25:27.120]  So we're subtracting eight from 14.
[25:27.120 --> 25:28.720]  So we're almost done with the games.
[25:29.040 --> 25:30.900]  Do the next hundred.
[25:31.220 --> 25:36.180]  Okay, so now we have left the games officially at this next hundred.
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.120]  We can really analyze.
[25:37.380 --> 25:40.620]  You can tell me what you think, where you go, where my brain went.
[25:40.700 --> 25:43.140]  You can see some of these have connections, some of them do not.
[25:44.820 --> 25:48.940]  So we wrap up the games and the very first thing is Vancouver.
[25:49.880 --> 25:50.720]  Child kicker.
[25:50.940 --> 25:51.900]  Nice, three things.
[25:52.360 --> 25:54.900]  Yeah, because I have the koozie on my desk.
[25:55.660 --> 25:57.680]  Did you Kaiser Soze a moment?
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.920]  I like that you've gone from games to... you can't pluck anything out of your brain.
[26:02.020 --> 26:04.820]  You're already staring around the room for inspiration.
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.340]  Barbecue sauce, ketchup, mustard, ranch, mayo.
[26:09.200 --> 26:10.400]  Disney Channel.
[26:11.360 --> 26:12.560]  Disney Parks.
[26:12.860 --> 26:14.220]  Disney Company.
[26:14.480 --> 26:15.640]  Those are all separate things.
[26:15.960 --> 26:16.560]  Packages.
[26:17.060 --> 26:17.660]  Flags.
[26:17.860 --> 26:18.780]  Oh, you should have put banners.
[26:19.200 --> 26:20.380]  Ranked games.
[26:21.280 --> 26:22.280]  Ciabatta bread.
[26:22.700 --> 26:23.600]  Johnny Bravo.
[26:25.560 --> 26:27.060]  Dexter Labs.
[26:27.280 --> 26:28.060]  Scooby Doo.
[26:28.260 --> 26:28.940]  Teen Titans.
[26:29.080 --> 26:29.800]  Oh my God.
[26:29.840 --> 26:30.400]  Doug.
[26:30.780 --> 26:31.420]  Video games.
[26:31.540 --> 26:32.340]  Board games.
[26:32.580 --> 26:33.240]  Pass.
[26:34.220 --> 26:35.000]  Rainbow.
[26:39.020 --> 26:39.820]  Orange.
[26:39.980 --> 26:40.340]  Plum.
[26:40.460 --> 26:40.720]  Great.
[26:40.840 --> 26:41.240]  Bananas.
[26:41.480 --> 26:42.300]  Luke Skywalker.
[26:43.700 --> 26:44.900]  Liam Neeson.
[26:46.960 --> 26:48.560]  Michael Fassbender.
[26:48.760 --> 26:49.880]  Troy Aikman.
[26:50.420 --> 26:54.480]  This is like... you get inspiration in a new direction.
[26:54.680 --> 26:55.760]  You'll be like, ooh, fruit.
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.920]  You'll do like three fruit and then move on to something completely different.
[27:00.060 --> 27:01.240]  It's so scatterbrained.
[27:01.420 --> 27:02.140]  I love it.
[27:02.800 --> 27:05.020]  So this is what happened with Liam Neeson.
[27:05.220 --> 27:08.240]  I wasn't confident I would know how to spell Qui-Gon Jinn.
[27:08.500 --> 27:09.840]  So I just went Liam Neeson.
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.180]  Didn't trust it.
[27:11.320 --> 27:13.180]  Oh, you had a run of Kennys.
[27:14.160 --> 27:15.520]  I did have a run of Kennys.
[27:15.720 --> 27:16.240]  Kenny Rogers.
[27:16.480 --> 27:17.100]  Kenny Loggins.
[27:17.240 --> 27:17.820]  Kenny Powers.
[27:17.820 --> 27:18.820]  Kenny Hotz.
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.180]  Kenny from South Park.
[27:20.560 --> 27:21.740]  Kung Fu Kenny.
[27:23.220 --> 27:24.140]  Great Kenny.
[27:24.980 --> 27:26.380]  Did you rush our reference?
[27:26.580 --> 27:29.000]  Bring it back to Jackie Chan.
[27:29.560 --> 27:31.980]  Okay, so now we'll do the next hundred.
[27:33.980 --> 27:36.860]  Once again, none of these are video games.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.840]  Yeah, is that Rumors the Album or Rumors the Thing?
[27:41.920 --> 27:44.260]  Rumors the Th... Album.
[27:44.620 --> 27:45.200]  We'll say the Album.
[27:45.720 --> 27:45.940]  Okay.
[27:46.690 --> 27:51.820]  So this is the last of the list.
[27:52.320 --> 27:54.260]  This is the end of your list?
[27:54.840 --> 27:56.480]  This is the end of the list.
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.000]  You suck.
[27:59.280 --> 28:00.500]  That's so bad.
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.720]  You went back to video games for a while.
[28:04.540 --> 28:05.540]  Bruce Lee.
[28:06.200 --> 28:06.580]  Kirby.
[28:06.740 --> 28:07.120]  Not games.
[28:08.760 --> 28:11.480]  Bayonetta, Bayonetta 2, Bayonetta 3.
[28:12.260 --> 28:13.040]  Those are games.
[28:13.400 --> 28:14.280]  Those are games, dude.
[28:14.360 --> 28:14.780]  Those are games.
[28:14.780 --> 28:15.880]  Those are games.
[28:15.880 --> 28:20.000]  Went from Skyfox Online Remastered to Chris Pratt.
[28:20.120 --> 28:21.900]  Sinking the Super Mario movie.
[28:22.280 --> 28:22.820]  Oh.
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.180]  Keegan-Michael Key.
[28:25.760 --> 28:26.160]  Jack Black.
[28:26.180 --> 28:28.360]  These are all voice actors on the Mario movie.
[28:28.600 --> 28:29.580]  Taylor Choi.
[28:30.100 --> 28:30.420]  Garlic bread.
[28:30.960 --> 28:32.540]  Then garlic bread in the middle.
[28:32.760 --> 28:33.920]  Filet-O-Fish.
[28:34.660 --> 28:35.080]  Paprika.
[28:35.840 --> 28:38.200]  Indiana, you could have just done all the states.
[28:38.900 --> 28:39.780]  That's a 350.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.860]  Rosemary, thyme, cherries, Nelly.
[28:48.450 --> 28:50.650]  Ja Rule, Regis Philbin.
[28:51.050 --> 28:57.550]  Can I ask how you got devil, satanic symbols, Tristan Thompson?
[29:07.650 --> 29:10.830]  Tristan Thompson, I was thinking about the trade deadline on Thursday.
[29:10.830 --> 29:12.750]  Is this traded? Gerpal's a thing.
[29:13.270 --> 29:14.410]  Gerpal's definitely a thing.
[29:14.870 --> 29:18.870]  So, I may have had some burger confidence in this.
[29:19.010 --> 29:20.230]  I may have greatly overestimated.
[29:20.370 --> 29:23.570]  I may have fell asleep at my desk, eating up most of my time.
[29:23.830 --> 29:24.810]  My grand total.
[29:25.090 --> 29:26.250]  You still had...
[29:26.250 --> 29:35.510]  Basically, if you subtract 8 hours from your time, you went from having to do 29 a minute to 55 a minute.
[29:35.870 --> 29:36.650]  Yeah, I'm not that fast.
[29:37.830 --> 29:41.290]  I feel like you still wasted all of the hours that you were awake.
[29:41.610 --> 29:43.030]  What do you mean I wasted?
[29:43.830 --> 29:44.830]  What do you mean?
[29:45.530 --> 29:48.390]  I thought the video game library idea was a great plan.
[29:48.770 --> 29:50.450]  It almost took me 2,000.
[29:52.090 --> 29:55.450]  When you leave the video game library, that's where it becomes a problem.
[29:55.570 --> 29:58.390]  Because I can't remember, did I talk about John Hughes previously?
[29:58.550 --> 30:00.670]  Did I talk about Satanism?
[30:01.110 --> 30:02.810]  Did I talk about Tristan Thompson?
[30:03.150 --> 30:04.050]  It becomes difficult.
[30:04.050 --> 30:07.250]  But this is my commitment, because I lost this by a lot.
[30:07.250 --> 30:11.830]  I was just 19,000 shy.
[30:12.130 --> 30:14.590]  I'm going to keep up with this list of things.
[30:15.070 --> 30:18.530]  I will name 20,000 things, and we'll just see how long it takes.
[30:18.910 --> 30:20.950]  So how many is on this list?
[30:21.310 --> 30:26.890]  1,009, that's not subtracting the 5 NHL duplicates, so 1,004.
[30:27.590 --> 30:32.230]  I was just a slight 19,000 short.
[30:33.490 --> 30:37.470]  You've written, gun the video game, and then below that you've written a gun.
[30:38.290 --> 30:42.210]  You wrote Macho Man and Randy Savage as two different things.
[30:42.410 --> 30:42.830]  Different things.
[30:43.390 --> 30:45.970]  One's the character, one's the human, I'm guessing.
[30:46.490 --> 30:49.030]  I like that you wrote Al Horford and then brick.
[30:51.010 --> 30:54.510]  I don't know if that's a dig at Al Horford.
[30:55.270 --> 30:58.170]  No, it wasn't. I just immediately thought of the movie Brick.
[30:58.590 --> 31:00.210]  And then the song Brick.
[31:00.210 --> 31:04.750]  So if you had a progress bar of what you tried to achieve today,
[31:04.770 --> 31:09.670]  and what you actually did, it would be at 5%.
[31:10.970 --> 31:15.410]  Well, as we said going in, we didn't know how difficult this would be.
[31:15.510 --> 31:18.510]  This is very difficult. I'm happy with the list I have.
[31:18.790 --> 31:21.010]  I'm going to continue to build off this list.
[31:21.150 --> 31:24.670]  I will do 20,000 things, and we'll just see how it goes.
[31:25.590 --> 31:27.070]  Well, I'm not even going to set a timeline.
[31:27.210 --> 31:29.370]  That'd be dumb of me to declare when this will be done.
[31:29.370 --> 31:32.410]  But I'm going to be actively working on this list.
[31:32.810 --> 31:35.470]  And I'll let you guys know when I have 20,000 things.
[31:35.870 --> 31:38.250]  And then I'll read it out, or am I reading out the thousand?
[31:38.810 --> 31:40.450]  I think it'd be funny to have like a six hour...
[31:40.950 --> 31:42.810]  You're going to read out 20,000 things, yeah.
[31:43.130 --> 31:43.450]  Okay.
[31:43.730 --> 31:46.850]  Yeah, now's your opportunity to transfer it to the Google Doc and continue in there.
[31:47.110 --> 31:50.270]  And in the meantime, I'll just turn my printer off.
[31:50.510 --> 31:51.710]  I think we should still print it.
[31:51.770 --> 31:53.770]  I don't think you have to print it, but we should print it.
[31:54.070 --> 31:57.030]  I just am curious how many, like 2,000 things, 20,000.
[31:57.030 --> 32:00.070]  Can you just not print it during a record? Is that okay?
[32:00.350 --> 32:00.950]  Can you just...
[32:00.950 --> 32:01.410]  Yeah, that's fine.
[32:01.530 --> 32:02.330]  Okay, just making sure.
[32:02.670 --> 32:03.630]  No, I've learned my lesson.
[32:04.190 --> 32:05.330]  I've learned my lesson from the law.
[32:06.270 --> 32:06.850]  It won.
[32:07.390 --> 32:08.510]  It was a very one-sided battle.
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.380]  This ad is brought to you by HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit.

[32:42.200 --> 32:44.040]  I'm somebody who loves HelloFresh.
[32:44.120 --> 32:46.080]  I've talked about it so many times before on these ads.
[32:46.160 --> 32:47.820]  Just even getting the box is exciting.
[32:48.340 --> 32:52.220]  The recipes are so easy to use and to kind of just...
[32:52.220 --> 32:53.580]  There's a huge variety of them.
[32:54.060 --> 32:55.440]  It's a great product.

[33:25.440 --> 33:30.640]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like checking in your baggage at the airport without a lock.
[33:31.020 --> 33:37.740]  You think your stuff is kept private, but you never know who's going through your panties, hemorrhoid cream, and sex toys.
[33:38.400 --> 33:40.020]  Why does everyone need a VPN?
[33:40.580 --> 33:47.160]  When you go online without a VPN, internet service providers, ISPs, can see every single website you visit.
[33:47.460 --> 33:54.740]  They can legally sell this information without your consent to ad companies and tech giants who then use your data to target you.
[33:54.740 --> 33:56.520]  Why use ExpressVPN?
[33:57.100 --> 33:58.360]  Browse more anonymously.
[33:58.500 --> 34:02.060]  When you use ExpressVPN, ISPs cannot see your online activity.
[34:02.460 --> 34:05.820]  Your identity is anonymized by a secure VPN server.
[34:06.300 --> 34:09.020]  Your data is also encrypted for maximum protection.
[34:09.640 --> 34:10.460]  Easy to use.
[34:10.900 --> 34:13.020]  Fire up the app and click one button.
[34:13.580 --> 34:14.680]  Works on all devices.
[34:15.100 --> 34:19.640]  Phones, laptops, even routers, so everyone who shares your Wi-Fi can be protected.
[34:19.640 --> 34:25.620]  I personally really like a VPN because it's great for using streaming libraries if you're in a different region,
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.860]  as well as the protection of it and just being anonymous and security values,
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.780]  but really it's just being able to access other libraries as well in regions you cannot access.

[34:52.520 --> 34:55.380]  I get really nervous when I have to do the smelling part because of Geoff.
[34:55.700 --> 34:59.560]  F*** you, Gavin. Maybe can't see it on an ad. You might need to edit that out, Nick. Bye.
[35:01.920 --> 35:05.780]  So that was my day. I fell asleep at my desk, and then I wrote this list.
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.160]  The fact that I only had five duplicates, I feel like I should get a little bit of credit.
[35:10.280 --> 35:11.000]  Well, that we noticed.
[35:11.660 --> 35:12.480]  Yeah, that we noticed.
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.380]  I feel like you guys are pretty thorough in your breakdown of this list.
[35:18.300 --> 35:20.580]  What do you think Jack will think any of this means?
[35:21.080 --> 35:24.100]  Yeah, I don't know what Jack's going to do with this.
[35:24.360 --> 35:25.460]  I don't know.
[35:25.820 --> 35:29.300]  I felt like I was in the pitch meeting for we didn't start the fire.
[35:29.840 --> 35:30.720]  That's how I felt.
[35:31.420 --> 35:32.940]  Which I should have put on this list.
[35:33.440 --> 35:35.660]  And you could have just gone down that list.
[35:36.860 --> 35:39.140]  The Maryland Monroe is because of that.
[35:39.560 --> 35:40.580]  But I didn't put anything else.
[35:41.380 --> 35:43.540]  It's a Maryland Monroe somewhere on this list.
[35:44.060 --> 35:45.240]  So that was my day.
[35:45.640 --> 35:45.760]  Dark day.
[35:45.760 --> 35:46.660]  I'm honestly...
[35:47.360 --> 35:48.580]  So you slept all day.
[35:50.580 --> 35:52.800]  Well, no. Part of the day.
[35:53.060 --> 35:54.720]  And then I wrote this list.
[35:55.620 --> 35:58.060]  You did a lot more sleeping than list writing.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.280]  He named a thousand things he's supposed to get to 20,000.
[36:04.280 --> 36:05.660]  He went, that's my day.
[36:05.760 --> 36:08.020]  And you just went, so you slept all day.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.580]  He didn't do shit.
[36:16.860 --> 36:18.860]  He just slept for eight hours.
[36:22.980 --> 36:25.320]  I'm not going to blame anybody.
[36:25.920 --> 36:27.460]  Who would you blame?
[36:29.060 --> 36:30.060]  Hear me out.
[36:30.580 --> 36:31.180]  Hear me out.
[36:31.600 --> 36:33.420]  Started very early in the morning.
[36:33.420 --> 36:35.720]  Started very early on these recordings.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.320]  The bookend was very early for me.
[36:39.220 --> 36:41.920]  I think with a lack of a normal sleep schedule,
[36:42.620 --> 36:47.440]  I think you're seeing at least five to six times the amount of things on that list.
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.060]  Do you remember when he started the day saying that he felt sharp?
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.140]  He was like a sharpened knife.
[36:53.280 --> 36:55.760]  He was ready and then he slept for eight hours.
[36:56.320 --> 36:59.360]  Do you remember by the end of the episode?
[36:59.580 --> 37:01.640]  I was yawning and saying I was a dull blade.
[37:01.640 --> 37:03.940]  I was clear, I didn't...
[37:03.940 --> 37:05.480]  He lost steam.
[37:06.320 --> 37:07.380]  We lost some steam.
[37:08.300 --> 37:11.540]  So if you had done five to six times better,
[37:11.660 --> 37:14.680]  that would have put you in the 25 to 30% range.
[37:15.360 --> 37:19.320]  Yeah, you know, I honestly, I just don't have the ability to type that fast.
[37:20.320 --> 37:22.100]  He wasted half of the hours.
[37:22.200 --> 37:26.420]  He was awake, poorly transcribing video games from one place to the other.
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.660]  How was the experience?
[37:28.920 --> 37:30.740]  Was it as miserable as I hope it was?
[37:30.740 --> 37:32.220]  Yeah, it was not good.
[37:32.380 --> 37:35.300]  There was no joy in the transcription of any of that.
[37:35.400 --> 37:36.700]  And it's just going to get worse.
[37:37.780 --> 37:39.460]  You're 5% of the way through.
[37:39.820 --> 37:41.060]  And you're out of video games.
[37:42.440 --> 37:44.080]  Well, I'm out of games I own.
[37:45.040 --> 37:47.520]  I could go into a Best Buy and really shake things up.
[37:50.680 --> 37:52.480]  Just think of different things.
[37:52.680 --> 37:53.640]  It's all in your brain.
[37:54.600 --> 37:55.500]  You have all the information.
[37:55.800 --> 37:57.140]  I'm going to get there. I'm going to get there.
[37:57.300 --> 37:58.640]  I definitely am going to get there.
[37:58.640 --> 38:00.140]  It's just it didn't happen today.
[38:00.980 --> 38:04.100]  That early recording really took a lot.
[38:04.480 --> 38:05.500]  Oh, Nick's got a good question.
[38:05.640 --> 38:08.920]  Did you add McDonald's when you did because that was the meal you had at that moment?
[38:09.400 --> 38:10.400]  That is factually correct.
[38:13.600 --> 38:15.620]  That is absolutely right.
[38:17.540 --> 38:18.680]  Did you go for hotcakes?
[38:18.840 --> 38:20.060]  You fucking nailed it, Nick.
[38:20.160 --> 38:21.940]  No, but I thought of the hack.
[38:22.200 --> 38:25.220]  I had a nice 10-piece value chicken nugget meal.
[38:25.700 --> 38:28.000]  Did you put hotcakes and hack on your list?
[38:29.560 --> 38:31.360]  I definitely put hotcakes.
[38:31.420 --> 38:31.740]  Okay.
[38:32.140 --> 38:33.740]  I don't know if I put hack.
[38:34.180 --> 38:36.820]  All this laughing is making my fucking mouth hurt.
[38:36.900 --> 38:38.040]  Oh, God damn.
[38:40.620 --> 38:41.340]  I'm excited.
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.240]  I don't know one day out of the blue.
[38:43.240 --> 38:43.420]  Why?
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.740]  I'm just going to be like, well, because I've started this journey and I'm going to get to 20,000 things.
[38:48.960 --> 38:50.460]  And one day I'll be like, hey, I did.
[38:50.560 --> 38:51.520]  I finally did the thing.
[38:51.600 --> 38:54.720]  But the impressive thing would have been to have done it in a day.
[38:54.800 --> 38:56.080]  That was the thing you were bragging about.
[38:56.080 --> 39:00.440]  Anyone can name 20,000 things between now and the end of their life.
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.120]  Yeah, you're going to name one thing for 20,000 days and then give us a list.
[39:04.580 --> 39:06.240]  I'm not going for impressive.
[39:06.500 --> 39:08.840]  I'm just saying you want to know how long it actually took me.
[39:09.780 --> 39:12.540]  I was incorrect in stating I could easily do it.
[39:13.560 --> 39:19.640]  Well, once again, a day in which I didn't sleep most of, I would have done a lot more damage to this list.
[39:20.160 --> 39:22.480]  By five or six times is what you said.
[39:22.480 --> 39:30.800]  You think you would have been at 6,000 had you not spent the morning in a tub and the afternoon face down on your desk.
[39:31.240 --> 39:33.160]  Yes. Yes. Yes, I do.
[39:33.500 --> 39:35.540]  I think I could have hit 5,000.
[39:36.240 --> 39:38.160]  20,000 was never going to happen.
[39:38.520 --> 39:41.200]  Well, why don't you just do 5,000 tomorrow then?
[39:43.180 --> 39:45.400]  No, we're doing the break shit tomorrow.
[39:45.540 --> 39:46.100]  Oh, yeah.
[39:46.180 --> 39:49.340]  For an hour and a half. That's like a third of your nap time.
[39:51.420 --> 39:56.960]  No, but I get so stressed doing anything live, I'm going to be fucking sleepy as soon as we're done with that.
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.120]  I get nervous. I get nervous doing the break shit.
[40:01.500 --> 40:03.900]  Well, how? You don't have to do anything. You're just a voice.
[40:04.800 --> 40:11.340]  No, but I'm trying to add... I don't want to feel... I feel like you don't... I don't want to just be dead weight.
[40:11.500 --> 40:14.140]  I appreciate that. That's true.
[40:14.260 --> 40:17.160]  And it's a live performance. I'm trying to be invested in it.
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.420]  And it's because it's the only live thing I do. I find it stressful.
[40:20.740 --> 40:20.860]  Yeah.
[40:20.980 --> 40:28.480]  And it's a lot better than it was when I started, but I typically find I'm drained earlier than I normally would on a standard regulation day.
[40:28.600 --> 40:31.480]  Yeah, that's totally fair. That's totally fair. I won't criticize that.
[40:31.480 --> 40:34.960]  Friday, on the other hand, I don't think we have anything for the show on Friday. We're doing one on Thursday.
[40:35.580 --> 40:39.760]  I don't know. OK, we'll see. I'm not committing to this right now. It's been a day.
[40:40.000 --> 40:40.940]  What the fuck are we going to talk about on Thursday?
[40:41.420 --> 40:42.840]  5,000 things to my list.
[40:43.180 --> 40:45.600]  When is this going to come out? Are we recording next week?
[40:46.120 --> 40:46.500]  I'm down.
[40:46.500 --> 40:51.220]  Well, I think Gavin's gone, but I thought we talked earlier about recording next week.
[40:51.620 --> 40:55.700]  Uh, yeah, we talked about it last time, but, yeah. We'll talk about it after.
[40:56.060 --> 41:01.420]  I just assumed you were gone. Like, the whole point of us doing three this week is that you're going to be gone starting next week.
[41:01.540 --> 41:07.460]  When we're done with this one, where does... oh, this one comes out the 8th. And I'll be back... when am I back?
[41:09.120 --> 41:10.920]  You can fill time while I look.
[41:11.340 --> 41:12.860]  There's... I think...
[41:12.860 --> 41:15.120]  Didn't you just say we'll talk about this after?
[41:15.860 --> 41:17.600]  Yeah, let's talk about it after.
[41:18.260 --> 41:23.780]  What do you mean? Do you really think we're going to stick around to hang out with you after?
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.060]  No offense, I love you. You're the best friend I've ever had.
[41:29.320 --> 41:36.260]  But I have no desire to spend one second with you past the moment we stop recording.
[41:36.460 --> 41:38.740]  It is going to be fucking midnight 30.
[41:39.480 --> 41:42.080]  And I'm already three hours past my bedtime.
[41:43.220 --> 41:44.320]  Nah, we'll be done at midnight.
[41:48.480 --> 41:51.100]  I'm going to be kind of annoyed if we record again next week.
[41:51.260 --> 41:52.220]  Oh, my fucking mouth hurts.
[41:52.220 --> 41:55.040]  I'll just say it. I'll just say it. I'm open to it.
[41:55.500 --> 41:57.040]  Why don't you just pull your tooth out, Geoff?
[41:57.280 --> 41:57.640]  Dude!
[41:58.500 --> 42:00.860]  No, we're good after that. This is the last one we need.
[42:01.240 --> 42:05.900]  I thought we were recording one on Thursday. This Thursday. Because we were doing three this week.
[42:06.020 --> 42:07.620]  Our normal one. Yeah, we don't need it though.
[42:07.940 --> 42:09.980]  Oh, so we're done? Well, wait. No.
[42:09.980 --> 42:12.720]  Why are we doing this?
[42:12.920 --> 42:15.760]  That's what I want to talk to you about. The one we didn't need.
[42:15.820 --> 42:16.860]  What are you talking about?
[42:16.880 --> 42:18.660]  The one we didn't need is this one.
[42:19.560 --> 42:21.180]  What are you talking about?
[42:22.100 --> 42:23.360]  What are you saying?
[42:24.120 --> 42:24.700]  I got...
[42:24.700 --> 42:25.640]  What are you saying?
[42:27.200 --> 42:29.920]  People are changing dates on me all the time.
[42:30.080 --> 42:30.560]  And I'm trying to...
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.520]  What are you saying?
[42:31.620 --> 42:34.720]  Trying to make sure that that happens is that we don't have a missing slot.
[42:34.860 --> 42:36.660]  So we're being extra careful.
[42:37.300 --> 42:38.380]  What are you saying?
[42:38.380 --> 42:42.320]  Today, what was confirmed to me is that I will in fact be back.
[42:43.440 --> 42:44.400]  And, uh...
[42:44.400 --> 42:46.420]  We don't need...
[42:46.420 --> 42:46.900]  This one.
[42:47.120 --> 42:49.140]  When was it confirmed to you?
[42:49.380 --> 42:50.880]  Uh, in an email about three o'clock.
[42:51.140 --> 42:52.580]  You never thought to mention it?
[42:52.920 --> 42:54.560]  You never considered it?
[42:54.560 --> 42:56.900]  Well, Andrew, to be fair, you were asleep.
[42:57.780 --> 42:58.900]  I don't care!
[42:59.200 --> 43:00.300]  That doesn't matter.
[43:00.760 --> 43:02.980]  You fucking... I love you. You fucking idiot.
[43:02.980 --> 43:06.300]  You posted the select channel at 9pm.
[43:06.500 --> 43:09.960]  This is a dumb idea. You could have said all day. We don't need to do it.
[43:10.080 --> 43:12.180]  But here's the thing. Here's the thing.
[43:12.620 --> 43:14.080]  I probably can't do Thursday.
[43:14.740 --> 43:14.880]  What?
[43:15.760 --> 43:17.260]  Okay, well that changes it.
[43:18.300 --> 43:18.700]  That's...
[43:19.380 --> 43:20.880]  That's... You should open with that.
[43:21.080 --> 43:22.640]  You should have let in that Thursday is dead.
[43:22.640 --> 43:25.400]  That should have been the first part of all of this and then talk about...
[43:25.820 --> 43:27.600]  Talk about burying the lead.
[43:27.920 --> 43:30.740]  In the grand scheme of things, this was the dumb one.
[43:32.120 --> 43:33.220]  It's just worked out.
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.220]  So you can't record on Thursday?
[43:35.520 --> 43:36.220]  It's unlikely.
[43:36.740 --> 43:37.600]  You motherfucker.
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.960]  Why? What are you doing to me on Thursday?
[43:40.340 --> 43:43.100]  I was going to record the podcast. That's what we do every Thursday.
[43:43.380 --> 43:43.900]  Nah, it's fine.
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.720]  I don't suppose you're probably not going to the break show tomorrow either, right?
[43:47.780 --> 43:48.980]  I don't think you're ever planning on that.
[43:49.220 --> 43:50.400]  No, I was never doing that one.
[43:50.680 --> 43:51.160]  Yeah, that's cool.
[43:51.260 --> 43:51.620]  Unfortunately.
[43:52.120 --> 43:52.660]  Thank God.
[43:57.100 --> 43:58.340]  I'm rattled right now.
[43:58.340 --> 44:01.700]  I can do Thursday if it's like 9pm, but we don't want to do it.
[44:01.820 --> 44:03.480]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:03.500 --> 44:06.260]  I've already deleted it. It's gone. It's off the calendar.
[44:06.620 --> 44:06.680]  Okay.
[44:06.920 --> 44:07.500]  It's gone.
[44:09.560 --> 44:11.600]  So we're not doing next Thursday or we are?
[44:11.660 --> 44:14.200]  We're not. No, we're not doing next Thursday.
[44:14.400 --> 44:15.300]  We're not doing this Thursday.
[44:15.300 --> 44:17.780]  No, we are doing next Thursday. We're not doing this Thursday.
[44:18.240 --> 44:20.060]  No, I think next Thursday is dead too.
[44:20.280 --> 44:20.580]  Gavin?
[44:20.960 --> 44:23.020]  This is the last one we need. Then we're through.
[44:23.380 --> 44:25.940]  Yeah, he's gone. He's gone as of this week.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.460]  How am I the only one that got this? I never get anything.
[44:30.920 --> 44:34.300]  I would like to go back to the bit where I said, let's just talk about this.
[44:36.120 --> 44:42.740]  No, I want this on the podcast because somehow I don't come across as the dumbest one here in this recording.
[44:42.980 --> 44:46.400]  Somehow you have taken that mantle. This is insane.
[44:47.520 --> 44:48.980]  So we're done after this.
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.640]  I'm not going to see... you're going to be a different human being the next time we record.
[44:52.800 --> 44:54.120]  It's going to be a month.
[44:54.120 --> 44:55.660]  My album is over.
[44:56.060 --> 45:00.300]  We can do another one. It's just we don't need it. This will cover us.
[45:00.320 --> 45:01.320]  This will cover my actions.
[45:01.660 --> 45:03.360]  Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
[45:03.480 --> 45:04.020]  We can play Halo.
[45:04.280 --> 45:05.800]  It's too late. I'd love to play Halo.
[45:05.940 --> 45:09.120]  What if you get quarantined or something? Maybe we should have an extra one in the bag.
[45:09.340 --> 45:09.520]  Yeah.
[45:10.600 --> 45:10.900]  If you want.
[45:11.140 --> 45:12.440]  I don't know. That's up to the producer.
[45:13.340 --> 45:15.120]  Hey, guys, let's talk about it after.
[45:18.300 --> 45:19.580]  Oh, my mouth.
[45:20.780 --> 45:26.140]  Eric, why don't I just slack you all of my... because this is actually... it's annoying for you.
[45:26.240 --> 45:28.520]  It's very annoying for me the way my day has changed on me.
[45:28.800 --> 45:33.120]  So I'll just keep you up to date on Slack outside of content because I assume...
[45:33.840 --> 45:35.260]  Alright, it's annoying for you. It's annoying for me.
[45:35.480 --> 45:39.340]  It's got to be the most annoying for the audience to have to listen to this shite.
[45:39.520 --> 45:42.120]  So I'll just keep you informed in Slack.
[45:42.240 --> 45:44.420]  I think there are so many people that love it.
[45:44.420 --> 45:46.640]  But yes, please keep me informed on Slack.
[45:47.560 --> 45:48.540]  That's all I need.
[45:48.780 --> 45:50.780]  But again, we can talk about this after.
[45:51.380 --> 45:51.660]  Okay.
[45:52.300 --> 45:53.740]  I'm so excited to go to bed.
[45:54.300 --> 45:55.400]  I'm so excited.
[45:55.760 --> 45:56.800]  It's going to be so comfy.
[45:56.960 --> 45:57.780]  I'll be so warm.
[45:58.280 --> 45:59.920]  How? Oh, you're not going to be able to go to sleep.
[46:00.480 --> 46:02.000]  You'll be seeing through your eyelids again.
[46:02.220 --> 46:02.540]  Yeah.
[46:02.940 --> 46:05.460]  How long do you think it's going to take you to fall asleep?
[46:05.660 --> 46:08.000]  Oh, I'm going to be amped for at least an hour afterwards.
[46:08.560 --> 46:08.880]  Yeah.
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.520]  You're going to be going through my fucking list, double checking, making sure, going through the errors.
[46:13.520 --> 46:16.920]  Well, if you're going to be all amped up for another hour, let's just do another podcast.
[46:17.900 --> 46:18.280]  No.
[46:20.980 --> 46:21.700]  No, we're not.
[46:21.820 --> 46:22.680]  It's a terrible idea.
[46:24.200 --> 46:26.020]  Andrew, how long is it going to take you to fall asleep?
[46:26.280 --> 46:28.320]  Oh, I'm going to be up until like 5 a.m. now.
[46:28.380 --> 46:30.240]  My sleep schedule is fucked.
[46:31.020 --> 46:32.400]  It's so bad today.
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.620]  I imagine either that or you will fall asleep on your microphone.
[46:36.280 --> 46:44.080]  If I could get into the channel for the break shit stream, I would be there for pleasantries as soon as we're done. I'd just be waiting.
[46:44.500 --> 46:46.220]  I have live feed of an empty studio.
[46:46.380 --> 46:49.140]  Did you have QWERTY written backwards on your forehead when you woke up?
[47:01.200 --> 47:04.140]  Have you ever had keys on your keyboard stop working?
[47:05.440 --> 47:05.840]  Yes.
[47:06.220 --> 47:06.580]  Of course.
[47:06.920 --> 47:07.980]  How did you solve that?
[47:08.100 --> 47:08.800]  Got a new keyboard.
[47:09.200 --> 47:09.440]  Yeah.
[47:09.600 --> 47:10.300]  That is smart.
[47:10.420 --> 47:14.100]  I had a laptop that I think the Y and the T didn't work.
[47:14.100 --> 47:20.920]  And so whenever I wanted to use those letters, I'd have to copy and paste from a news story and put it in.
[47:21.580 --> 47:24.800]  And I thought, ah, I don't use these letters all that... you use them a lot.
[47:24.900 --> 47:30.320]  You don't realize how often you use certain letters until you have to copy and paste them anytime you want to put a message in.
[47:31.200 --> 47:33.120]  It was almost like I was playing Wordle in advance.
[47:33.340 --> 47:37.300]  Like I was trying to find alternate words for what I was trying to say during that time.
[47:37.600 --> 47:39.060]  It was an interesting challenge.
[47:39.060 --> 47:43.780]  I lost... this was back when I was on MSN Messenger back in the day.
[47:43.860 --> 47:49.340]  I lost G on my keyboard and I had to tell all my friends that I would be using 9 instead of G.
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.540]  And I actually got pretty good at just going to 9 subconsciously.
[47:53.880 --> 47:56.520]  And then when I got a new keyboard, I kept doing it. It was pretty annoying.
[47:56.800 --> 47:58.280]  I had to sort of unlearn that.
[47:58.320 --> 47:58.900]  Why 9?
[47:59.300 --> 47:59.960]  It looks like a G.
[48:00.340 --> 48:00.780]  Does it?
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.200]  Well, yeah, lowercase g.
[48:03.080 --> 48:04.920]  It's better than like a 7 or something.
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.120]  I would not say... if I saw the G in a 9 at a barbecue, I wouldn't assume they were related.
[48:10.760 --> 48:16.800]  I'm not saying it is a G. It's a 9. It's just... you can read it as a G if you want.
[48:17.980 --> 48:22.420]  Hmm. Well, what do you... at that point, couldn't... oh, I guess. I guess I see what you're saying.
[48:22.660 --> 48:23.780]  Like a 2 would be weird.
[48:24.020 --> 48:24.400]  Would it?
[48:24.560 --> 48:24.960]  2avin?
[48:27.380 --> 48:27.780]  Navin.
[48:29.140 --> 48:30.700]  I don't see how Navin is different.
[48:30.860 --> 48:32.320]  It looks like a G, man!
[48:32.820 --> 48:34.220]  It doesn't really, though.
[48:34.420 --> 48:34.520]  It does!
[48:34.520 --> 48:41.060]  I just did a G and a 9. No, I just did... that does not look like Gavin. You cannot tell me that looks like Gavin.
[48:42.680 --> 48:43.420]  Fair enough.
[48:43.840 --> 48:52.240]  No, it doesn't. And your whole argument of, if you decide it's a G, can be applied to literally anything. If we just decide anything is a G, it can be a G.
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.260]  Are you saying 9 is similar... is more similar to another letter?
[48:56.520 --> 49:00.980]  Dude, come on. Look at that. It's an open-loop G. That's a 9.
[49:00.980 --> 49:03.380]  That one, you know what? I'm not gonna argue that one.
[49:03.600 --> 49:05.280]  Did you forget how to write a G?
[49:05.740 --> 49:09.740]  Well, no. I mean, I'm looking at the G. It's just the 9 is different.
[49:10.020 --> 49:10.900]  Yeah, it's a 9!
[49:12.020 --> 49:13.160]  Seeing it up close.
[49:13.740 --> 49:17.020]  Yeah, the Discord G is a closed-loop G. It's a weird G.
[49:18.560 --> 49:20.520]  That's where it went wrong for me.
[49:20.640 --> 49:27.480]  I feel like you shouldn't come too hard at the two guys that have the first letter of their name as a G.
[49:28.100 --> 49:29.320]  Yeah, we know G pretty well.
[49:29.320 --> 49:30.920]  No, we know our way around the G.
[49:31.240 --> 49:32.100]  And we're both Gemini.
[49:32.440 --> 49:32.940]  That's true.
[49:33.240 --> 49:34.500]  It's fucking G squared up here.
[49:34.880 --> 49:37.440]  We're both nine... nine M and I.
[49:43.460 --> 49:44.880]  Why did you do that while I was drinking?
[49:47.400 --> 49:48.440]  How's Henry doing?
[49:48.780 --> 49:49.220]  He's asleep.
[49:49.240 --> 49:49.780]  Want a Henry update?
[49:50.060 --> 49:51.440]  He's missing this one too.
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.020]  We're missing... we're overkill for Henry.
[49:54.140 --> 49:56.520]  Before his awake time and after his bedtime today.
[49:56.520 --> 50:00.020]  He already has his diaper on.
[50:00.400 --> 50:03.920]  And when he puts his diaper on, he loses his bones.
[50:04.280 --> 50:06.140]  And then he becomes a floppy thing.
[50:06.420 --> 50:08.840]  And he just sprawls out.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.500]  And so he doesn't have any bones right now.
[50:12.080 --> 50:13.560]  Huh. I'm trying to think.
[50:13.980 --> 50:14.600]  Go for it.
[50:14.680 --> 50:15.080]  Well, what?
[50:15.660 --> 50:16.540]  Well, it's tough.
[50:16.920 --> 50:17.980]  I'm just... I'm trying to think.
[50:18.000 --> 50:18.500]  It's tough.
[50:18.560 --> 50:19.720]  It can just be the end of the sentence.
[50:20.920 --> 50:22.420]  But... Gavin with a 9.
[50:23.060 --> 50:26.120]  So would you come with the same conclusion, Geoff?
[50:26.240 --> 50:26.520]  With a 9?
[50:27.160 --> 50:30.240]  Yeah. If I had to substitute a G, I would pick a 9.
[50:30.400 --> 50:30.900]  Or a 6.
[50:31.040 --> 50:31.640]  What about an A?
[50:31.740 --> 50:32.300]  I feel left out.
[50:32.420 --> 50:33.080]  What would be my number?
[50:33.200 --> 50:34.500]  Like, I might do this.
[50:35.020 --> 50:36.100]  6? You went with a 6?
[50:36.180 --> 50:37.060]  6, yeah.
[50:37.220 --> 50:37.880]  Like, that looks...
[50:37.880 --> 50:39.460]  6 is probably better, actually.
[50:39.520 --> 50:39.540]  Or a 4!
[50:39.700 --> 50:43.840]  6 looks more like an uppercase G than a 9 looks like a G.
[50:44.040 --> 50:44.960]  Yeah, I should have done 6.
[50:45.280 --> 50:46.860]  Look, I was probably 12.
[50:51.200 --> 50:53.040]  Yeah, 4 is a great one for A.
[50:53.520 --> 50:53.760]  Yeah.
[50:54.040 --> 50:55.140]  That's a great alternative.
[50:56.180 --> 50:57.260]  Great A alternative.
[50:58.080 --> 51:02.120]  If you've been looking for an alternative A in your life, let me suggest you the 4.
[51:03.580 --> 51:04.800]  Why did we do this?
[51:04.860 --> 51:05.460]  I don't know.
[51:05.660 --> 51:06.940]  What are we talking about?
[51:07.440 --> 51:09.340]  You asked if you ever lost a key on your keyboard.
[51:09.740 --> 51:11.680]  No, I meant this show in general.
[51:11.940 --> 51:13.740]  This is a terrible idea.
[51:14.080 --> 51:15.360]  Let's never do this again.
[51:15.360 --> 51:16.840]  92 episodes and you're asking why we're doing this?
[51:16.840 --> 51:18.060]  Why we did this show in general?
[51:18.360 --> 51:21.660]  No, just this specific episode, not this show in general.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.360]  There's exciting things happening with the show in general.
[51:24.440 --> 51:25.820]  We're doing animated stuff.
[51:25.920 --> 51:27.420]  I don't know if I should talk about that yet.
[51:27.600 --> 51:28.360]  Yeah, go for it.
[51:28.400 --> 51:31.940]  We're starting to do an animated version of this, I guess?
[51:32.120 --> 51:33.580]  I watched you pick your head today.
[51:33.920 --> 51:34.460]  It was a good head.
[51:34.620 --> 51:34.900]  Wow.
[51:35.560 --> 51:36.440]  It was a good head.
[51:37.280 --> 51:38.060]  I like the head.
[51:38.200 --> 51:43.740]  When Gavin comes back from his trip, we'll start our new show, Does It Do? as well, I believe.
[51:44.160 --> 51:44.820]  We'll get that for you.
[51:44.820 --> 51:46.340]  Do we have that scheduled in?
[51:47.040 --> 51:48.320]  Yes, talk to the producer.
[51:48.540 --> 51:49.440]  He said yes.
[51:49.440 --> 51:51.660]  I just found out when you were going, so no.
[51:53.640 --> 51:54.160]  Alright.
[51:55.180 --> 51:56.560]  I deserve that.
[51:57.460 --> 52:02.440]  Could we ask the audience maybe for what would be great segments from the podcast to animate?
[52:02.900 --> 52:03.460]  Like what would convert?
[52:03.500 --> 52:04.580]  That's a great idea.
[52:05.120 --> 52:06.340]  I'm trying to think of things.
[52:06.340 --> 52:13.540]  If there's a topic on the subreddit, there's a f***face subreddit, then I would say probably make a post there
[52:13.540 --> 52:16.520]  and then have people link with times and go, ooh, I love this part.
[52:16.860 --> 52:17.840]  That probably really helps.
[52:18.700 --> 52:19.540]  That is a great idea.
[52:19.940 --> 52:22.740]  I think the child kick is the ultimate one to do.
[52:22.800 --> 52:23.480]  That's a pretty good one.
[52:23.540 --> 52:24.780]  That is one to eventually do.
[52:24.980 --> 52:25.740]  Go now.
[52:26.260 --> 52:27.140]  I feel like the chair...
[52:27.140 --> 52:28.940]  How are you going to animate? That's an entire film.
[52:29.220 --> 52:30.620]  That's a feature length episode.
[52:30.900 --> 52:31.160]  Yeah.
[52:31.580 --> 52:35.840]  Talking about not feeling like you're contributing to an episode, I don't think...
[52:35.840 --> 52:39.980]  I'd love to know the word count for Gavin and I in the Go Now episode.
[52:40.200 --> 52:42.880]  It has to be under 25 for both of us.
[52:42.880 --> 52:44.980]  That's a masterclass in storytelling.
[52:45.300 --> 52:46.540]  It was just such a good story.
[52:46.760 --> 52:49.520]  Yeah, it's I think the greatest story I will ever hear.
[52:49.640 --> 52:52.120]  Well, I'm never telling it again, so I'm glad I got it on record.
[52:52.120 --> 52:55.680]  Both in the content and the delivery of it. You did great.
[52:55.860 --> 52:57.240]  Riding the donkey story.
[52:57.640 --> 52:59.240]  Oh, when I rode the horse down the mountain?
[52:59.940 --> 53:00.180]  Yeah.
[53:00.760 --> 53:01.380]  Oh, yeah.
[53:06.520 --> 53:07.960]  Geoff bike break. Yeah.
[53:07.960 --> 53:18.680]  It would be interesting to take me choking the choking noises I've made throughout this show and just without context, have people try to, like, draw what they think happened or where that came from.
[53:19.420 --> 53:21.900]  Should we play a game next week called Guess the Choke?
[53:22.100 --> 53:25.820]  And we just, you play one from each event and we have to guess what was in your mouth.
[53:26.360 --> 53:27.200]  I love that idea.
[53:29.940 --> 53:32.840]  Do we care about copyright strikes on our YouTube channel?
[53:32.840 --> 53:37.680]  I was thinking about the Jurassic Park thing that Gavin made the other day.
[53:37.760 --> 53:39.120]  Well, we don't monetize it.
[53:39.280 --> 53:40.480]  Well, put it on Instagram.
[53:40.960 --> 53:41.080]  Yeah.
[53:41.380 --> 53:42.340]  Okay, that works.
[53:42.720 --> 53:45.060]  That was like six months ago at this point.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.320]  It was, yeah.
[53:46.440 --> 53:48.880]  It just randomly popped in my head when I was thinking of things.
[53:49.100 --> 53:49.560]  That was the thing.
[53:50.060 --> 53:51.040]  Six months is nothing.
[53:51.160 --> 53:53.200]  It took us a year to make a fucking port-a-potty mug.
[53:53.600 --> 53:54.040]  That's true.
[53:54.360 --> 53:55.180]  Where are we at on the ground?
[53:55.180 --> 53:55.620]  That is true.
[53:56.100 --> 53:56.960]  I don't know.
[53:57.040 --> 53:58.520]  Eric, do you know where we are in the ground tubes?
[53:59.160 --> 54:00.680]  We're back to the drawing board for a while.
[54:01.140 --> 54:01.900]  No, I don't.
[54:01.900 --> 54:03.640]  I don't have an update for that right now.
[54:03.820 --> 54:05.920]  I can find out tomorrow and let you guys know.
[54:06.300 --> 54:08.060]  Yeah, I guess it's probably too late to find out right now.
[54:08.300 --> 54:12.380]  Yeah, it's almost tomorrow, so just give me a little bit of time.
[54:12.620 --> 54:13.460]  Give you another ten minutes?
[54:13.700 --> 54:13.940]  Yeah.
[54:14.240 --> 54:14.780]  Could be tomorrow.
[54:15.080 --> 54:18.840]  Is there anything that you need to do that you've been putting off?
[54:19.260 --> 54:20.260]  You just keep forgetting about?
[54:20.480 --> 54:22.260]  I need to get my fucking tooth drilled.
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.580]  You're not forgetting about that.
[54:23.660 --> 54:27.020]  You almost bought a fucking ice skate and knocked it out yourself earlier today.
[54:27.500 --> 54:28.700]  That's frequent in your mind.
[54:28.960 --> 54:29.540]  What about you, Gavin?
[54:29.540 --> 54:32.960]  When's the last time you were like, oh, fuck, that is a thing I need to do?
[54:34.100 --> 54:35.140]  Or do you have one, Geoff?
[54:35.960 --> 54:38.120]  I had one today that is ridiculous.
[54:38.520 --> 54:39.340]  What is yours?
[54:39.680 --> 54:41.300]  I have a bed frame still on my patio.
[54:42.160 --> 54:45.580]  It's been there for like 20 days at this point.
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.200]  Whenever I swap beds, it's when I put it out there.
[54:51.020 --> 54:53.120]  And that's your balcony? Or is it on the ground?
[54:53.220 --> 54:55.000]  Yeah, it's like, no, it's on my balcony.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.140]  It's just taking up my balcony space and I need to get rid of it.
[54:58.160 --> 54:59.600]  But I keep forgetting it exists.
[54:59.800 --> 55:00.580]  Throw it off your balcony.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.200]  Isn't it covered in snow?
[55:02.620 --> 55:04.260]  I don't know the condition of it.
[55:04.300 --> 55:09.480]  We just had... people just moved in to the unit next to me.
[55:09.620 --> 55:11.240]  Which has been vacant for a long time.
[55:12.360 --> 55:16.120]  And I had a funny panic moment last night where I could hear talking.
[55:16.400 --> 55:22.360]  And I couldn't figure out if it was coming from the people in the unit next door or if it was outside.
[55:22.360 --> 55:25.480]  Because sometimes you can hear fighting and arguments going on outside my window.
[55:25.600 --> 55:27.440]  So I was like, ooh, I'm going to check this out.
[55:27.760 --> 55:30.660]  Even though I was curious, is it people next door or is it outside?
[55:30.820 --> 55:33.140]  I never processed what if it is people next door.
[55:33.260 --> 55:38.320]  I opened my door and immediately saw the outline of people and panicked and shut the door immediately.
[55:38.800 --> 55:39.460]  I never considered.
[55:39.740 --> 55:48.040]  And I just, I wondered what their, from their perspective, what that must have been like to hear the door open and immediately slam shut again.
[55:48.160 --> 55:49.620]  I'd assume you weren't wearing pants.
[55:49.760 --> 55:50.820]  Oh no, absolutely not.
[55:50.820 --> 55:53.280]  I was in my underwear as I was just getting ready.
[55:53.400 --> 55:54.840]  I was expecting to hear a fight.
[55:55.040 --> 55:58.080]  I have a question about your bed out there.
[55:58.180 --> 55:58.380]  Okay.
[55:58.540 --> 56:01.500]  Does it block your view of women pissing in the alley?
[56:01.960 --> 56:05.900]  Oh, that's, well, first of all, I'm not, I'm not looking for that.
[56:06.520 --> 56:07.300]  Second of all.
[56:07.500 --> 56:08.500]  You're not not looking.
[56:09.360 --> 56:09.900]  No, I'm not.
[56:09.960 --> 56:10.840]  I'm actively not.
[56:11.100 --> 56:16.280]  That was, that was an unfortunate thing that I witnessed.
[56:19.080 --> 56:20.360]  But no, it's not.
[56:20.680 --> 56:21.620]  I could, you know what?
[56:21.640 --> 56:24.020]  Here, I'll, uh, I'll take a photo of it right now.
[56:24.180 --> 56:25.480]  Oh, by all means, please.
[56:25.640 --> 56:25.940]  Hell yeah.
[56:27.140 --> 56:32.340]  I, uh, I'm not mad at you for this, but, uh, I'm not happy with you, Gavin.
[56:33.160 --> 56:34.040]  For this episode?
[56:34.240 --> 56:34.640]  Yeah.
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.060]  I'm so fucking tired.
[56:36.500 --> 56:39.820]  I've done the last, like, eight minutes with my eyes closed.
[56:40.140 --> 56:40.780]  I just can't.
[56:40.820 --> 56:43.440]  It sounded, it just sounded so funny at the time.
[56:43.440 --> 56:48.160]  It's like when you've always got those idiots on a night out, like trying to make plans with you the next day.
[56:48.340 --> 56:50.280]  Like, yeah, brunch tomorrow.
[56:50.380 --> 56:51.440]  It's like, you're going to be asleep.
[56:51.660 --> 56:52.080]  You're an idiot.
[56:52.260 --> 56:52.760]  You're stupid.
[56:53.660 --> 56:54.400]  Why bother making?
[56:54.480 --> 56:54.800]  I don't know.
[56:54.840 --> 56:55.700]  It's the same thing.
[56:55.760 --> 56:57.080]  It's like, why did we even agree?
[56:57.720 --> 56:59.080]  Cause someone should have just said no.
[56:59.620 --> 57:00.420]  No, cause we're there.
[57:00.520 --> 57:01.420]  Cause that's not...
[57:01.420 --> 57:02.120]  Facey.
[57:02.180 --> 57:02.620]  I know.
[57:03.220 --> 57:04.920]  We just, we did the face thing.
[57:05.280 --> 57:06.280]  Trapped ourselves with a name.
[57:06.640 --> 57:07.000]  I'll be honest.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.560]  I enjoyed this episode, even though.
[57:08.600 --> 57:09.220]  Oh, me too.
[57:09.300 --> 57:09.640]  I had a blast.
[57:09.820 --> 57:12.100]  Massively detrimental to my entire week.
[57:12.100 --> 57:15.700]  Next to going to sleep next to my girlfriend for the first time in two weeks.
[57:15.820 --> 57:18.280]  I can't think of anything I rather would have done tonight.
[57:20.060 --> 57:21.000]  So that's my balcony.
[57:21.160 --> 57:22.600]  Oh, it's just like the frame.
[57:23.160 --> 57:23.840]  Just the frame.
[57:24.520 --> 57:27.820]  So you could throw another bed out there and have an outside sleeping area.
[57:28.040 --> 57:28.800]  I've thought about that.
[57:29.080 --> 57:32.100]  I think that's kind of a great idea, but I don't know what to buy for that.
[57:32.700 --> 57:32.980]  A mattress?
[57:33.320 --> 57:36.400]  Why do you have what looks like the top of like a police car siren on the...
[57:36.400 --> 57:36.920]  Oh, is it a candle?
[57:37.700 --> 57:38.900]  It looks like a candle.
[57:38.900 --> 57:41.180]  Speaking of things I forgot about doing.
[57:41.520 --> 57:44.840]  That was from, I think, the first Break Shit stream?
[57:45.380 --> 57:48.500]  I opened up the waffle air freshener that we sell.
[57:48.960 --> 57:53.760]  And it smelled so bad, I decided to just throw it in a candle to burn it.
[57:53.900 --> 57:56.600]  And then I ran outside because it started smoking everywhere.
[57:57.200 --> 57:59.880]  And I'm above... I'm right below a smoke alarm.
[58:00.620 --> 58:01.960]  So that candle's been there as well.
[58:02.020 --> 58:05.320]  It hasn't been moved since I ran outside and I put...
[58:05.320 --> 58:08.420]  You're just slowly building a f*** face museum out there.
[58:10.840 --> 58:15.200]  I bet you the waffle is still... I'm gonna... Should I go check to see if the waffle is still?
[58:15.560 --> 58:16.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[58:16.180 --> 58:16.340]  I'll be right back.
[58:17.420 --> 58:18.720]  I'm so f***ing tired.
[58:19.740 --> 58:22.520]  He could deconstruct that frame, Nick says.
[58:22.980 --> 58:25.460]  Yeah, but then where's he gonna put the new bed? The outside bed?
[58:26.500 --> 58:28.280]  Does that mean he just had nothing out there?
[58:28.920 --> 58:32.340]  Yeah, well, he did until... Well, now he has a candle and a bed frame.
[58:32.820 --> 58:35.640]  Before that, yeah, I think it was pretty bare.
[58:35.860 --> 58:37.360]  I hope we get to go there one day.
[58:37.880 --> 58:41.100]  Dude, I am very excited to go there.
[58:41.440 --> 58:46.300]  I wanna f***ing hang out. I wanna light waffle bomb candles on that deck.
[58:46.940 --> 58:49.220]  Nick and Eric, are you coming to Canada with us when we go?
[58:49.440 --> 58:53.000]  Yeah, we'd love to. We can go crabbing and whatever other ideas.
[58:53.240 --> 58:56.340]  You gotta have someone hold the camera and Nick's gotta run audio, so I mean that...
[58:56.340 --> 58:57.720]  It's the only thing that makes sense.
[58:58.460 --> 58:59.380]  No waffle, unfortunately.
[58:59.980 --> 59:02.300]  Huh. What'll happen?
[59:03.060 --> 59:06.180]  Is that the candle you... No, different candle for the roast of marshmallow.
[59:06.180 --> 59:08.200]  Well, this is terrible.
[59:08.900 --> 59:09.800]  In a great way.
[59:11.280 --> 59:13.140]  We're done. Should we go to bed?
[59:13.740 --> 59:15.100]  Yeah, I think we can stop now.
[59:16.980 --> 59:18.280]  I've lost my second wind.
[59:18.440 --> 59:19.920]  Are we recording on Thursday or not?
[59:20.160 --> 59:22.060]  I'm not trying to do a bit. I genuinely...
[59:22.060 --> 59:26.200]  No, no, no. I've already taken it off the calendar. You're not recording the 10th.
[59:26.460 --> 59:28.540]  Are we recording the 17th?
[59:29.980 --> 59:31.540]  Gavin, that's where you say yes or no.
[59:31.880 --> 59:32.700]  That's a little too often.
[59:33.040 --> 59:33.640]  Oh my god.
[59:35.840 --> 59:38.960]  Well, there you go. You've done it again.
[59:39.200 --> 59:43.760]  You've listened to us torture ourselves and each other and by proxy you.
[59:44.060 --> 59:48.700]  I don't know what time it is where you're listening, but I know what time it is where we're recording.
[59:49.060 --> 59:51.080]  And I don't want it to be that time anymore.
[59:51.540 --> 59:58.580]  So we're going to stop and we're all going to go to sleep except for Andrew, who's going to stay up because he doesn't want to sleep past the break show in 18 hours.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.460]  Like and subscribe. We'll see you next time.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.980]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.280]  It's episode 94 and Geoff is back at the dentist.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.680]  The boys talk about AOL Instant Messenger.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.760]  Patton gets a squishy present.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.460]  Gavin still has handle issues.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.900]  The guys get knee deep in ass talk.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.380]  Which one is a blood sausage?
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.460]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.540]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
