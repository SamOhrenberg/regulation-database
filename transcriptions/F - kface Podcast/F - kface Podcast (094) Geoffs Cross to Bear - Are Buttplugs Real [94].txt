[00:33.840 --> 00:38.360]  You think if Maverick from Top Gun, let's say Tom Cruise, right?
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.500]  Say if Maverick from Top Gun walked by a school
[00:41.980 --> 00:45.620]  and saw kids playing Duck, Duck, Goose, would that be traumatizing for him?
[00:45.740 --> 00:48.100]  Yes. Yes. Yeah. It'd be horrific, right?
[00:48.360 --> 00:50.320]  He would have like World War One PTSD.
[00:50.720 --> 00:52.900]  Yeah. He'd get tremors and shit.
[00:53.160 --> 00:55.880]  I guess they call it Gray Duck in Minnesota or something.
[00:56.020 --> 00:59.240]  And so in a call, they don't call it Duck, Duck, Goose in Minnesota.
[00:59.460 --> 01:01.120]  It's like Duck, Duck, Gray Duck or something.
[01:01.760 --> 01:02.720]  What the fuck?
[01:03.220 --> 01:07.200]  So I heard the word goose said like 15 times in this conversation,
[01:07.220 --> 01:10.280]  and it just my brain randomly went to imagine if I was Maverick
[01:10.280 --> 01:13.320]  and how traumatizing this conversation would be for me right now.
[01:13.480 --> 01:15.920]  Just this quietly, I'm deeply disturbed
[01:15.920 --> 01:18.740]  thinking about my best friend's death when they're talking about a kid's game.
[01:18.940 --> 01:19.600]  What's that dude's name?
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.820]  Anthony Adams played, uh, Edwards, I believe Anthony Edwards.
[01:23.980 --> 01:25.040]  Maybe. Yeah, I think so.
[01:25.200 --> 01:27.660]  He's on E.R. right after that or before. Yeah.
[01:27.660 --> 01:29.920]  Yeah. He was on a conversation about this yesterday.
[01:30.900 --> 01:31.640]  Really? Yeah.
[01:32.560 --> 01:34.220]  We talked about this yesterday.
[01:34.500 --> 01:35.900]  Why don't talk about goose?
[01:36.740 --> 01:39.400]  We talked about those two actors
[01:39.400 --> 01:41.640]  and getting their names confused. Right.
[01:42.820 --> 01:45.020]  He was he was also on Northern Exposure.
[01:45.240 --> 01:47.300]  So you made almost the same mistake.
[01:47.520 --> 01:49.300]  I've made the same mistake, but in reverse today.
[01:49.440 --> 01:52.280]  I was talking about Anthony Adams yesterday and called him Anthony Edwards.
[01:52.400 --> 01:53.860]  And today I was talking about Anthony Adams.
[01:55.180 --> 01:56.480]  I don't think I know who Anthony Adams is.
[01:56.500 --> 01:59.320]  You're thinking now, Anthony Anderson.
[01:59.600 --> 02:01.140]  Anthony Anderson is what I was thinking of.
[02:01.220 --> 02:02.520]  Yeah. Who's Anthony Adams?
[02:04.040 --> 02:05.860]  Wait, can I admit something to you guys?
[02:05.860 --> 02:08.740]  Wait a second. You got Anthony Adams doesn't exist.
[02:08.740 --> 02:11.140]  No, Anthony Adams is a former football player.
[02:11.260 --> 02:12.940]  OK, what about Jesselnick?
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.200]  Anthony Jesselnick.
[02:14.520 --> 02:15.380]  Anthony Jesselnick.
[02:15.520 --> 02:16.400]  Are we naming Anthony?
[02:16.780 --> 02:18.200]  I don't know, dude. It's all confusing.
[02:18.620 --> 02:21.120]  I was conflating Anthony Adams and Anthony Anderson
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.260]  while I was confusing that person with Anthony Edwards.
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.580]  Can I make an admission to you guys that is for a child
[02:29.580 --> 02:33.160]  born in the 70s who grew up in the 80s is kind of it's kind of
[02:33.160 --> 02:35.180]  it's been a cross to bear my whole life.
[02:35.400 --> 02:38.040]  Yeah. What? I fucking hate the movie Top Gun.
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.180]  I never liked it.
[02:40.280 --> 02:43.000]  I never I saw it like on my friend's birthday.
[02:43.340 --> 02:46.480]  We went to it, you know, when it opened up and I was just like this.
[02:46.720 --> 02:49.520]  I don't why people like I thought Tom Cruise was such a prick.
[02:49.840 --> 02:50.560]  The entire film.
[02:50.700 --> 02:52.780]  I liked Goose and then he died.
[02:52.880 --> 02:53.920]  Then the movie was over for me.
[02:54.300 --> 02:55.180]  I never got it.
[02:55.960 --> 02:58.340]  It's I mean, Goose is definitely the heart of that movie.
[02:58.560 --> 02:59.420]  I think that movie sucks.
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.380]  Really? Thank you.
[03:00.840 --> 03:02.160]  Yeah, I think it sucks.
[03:02.600 --> 03:03.360]  Dog shit.
[03:03.620 --> 03:05.480]  It's not worth watching twice. That's for sure.
[03:05.660 --> 03:07.440]  Yeah. Why does my computer say it's snowing?
[03:07.700 --> 03:08.320]  I don't know.
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.640]  Says snowing now.
[03:09.900 --> 03:12.720]  Oh, it thinks I'm in Wixom, Michigan.
[03:13.140 --> 03:14.340]  What? Ah, great.
[03:14.620 --> 03:16.600]  Have you been in Wixom, Michigan lately?
[03:17.060 --> 03:18.040]  I don't think so.
[03:18.100 --> 03:19.140]  Did I never set like?
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.060]  Oops. Oh, I was going to I was going to ask you guys to do something for me.
[03:23.140 --> 03:24.400]  This should not be hard.
[03:24.480 --> 03:25.660]  It's pretty much par for the course.
[03:25.660 --> 03:29.040]  But could you guys do your best not to make me laugh for the next time?
[03:29.180 --> 03:30.240]  Oh, got it. The pain.
[03:31.160 --> 03:32.620]  Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[03:32.840 --> 03:33.400]  How did it go?
[03:34.660 --> 03:37.420]  Well, you know, I wanted to start off 2022
[03:37.420 --> 03:38.920]  like I started off 2021
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.840]  with root canals with your mouth with my mouth open
[03:43.840 --> 03:46.160]  with some old guy crawled up in it.
[03:46.540 --> 03:50.500]  Uh, yeah, I got part one of my root canal today on the first.
[03:50.560 --> 03:53.560]  You remember that first root canal I had way back a year and a half ago
[03:53.560 --> 03:55.600]  that took five sessions?
[03:56.240 --> 04:01.440]  Well, yes, that pesky little guy, guy got somehow got infected again.
[04:01.500 --> 04:05.300]  And so I'm on session six now on this tooth.
[04:05.300 --> 04:07.580]  Can you get your money back for the first five?
[04:08.160 --> 04:09.100]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.440]  I don't think there's a dentist don't have satisfaction guaranteed.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.600]  It's like an NFL contract.
[04:16.680 --> 04:19.720]  They said they they'll do their absolute best to eliminate the problem,
[04:19.840 --> 04:21.500]  but it can come back. And it did.
[04:21.780 --> 04:22.680]  So, you know, it's cool.
[04:22.820 --> 04:26.080]  I got a root canal today and then I'll get another one next week
[04:26.080 --> 04:28.920]  and then I'll be done until the seven and done.
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.320]  Or is it? Oh, it's it's either it's either
[04:32.860 --> 04:35.320]  he fixes it Wednesday or we pull the tooth.
[04:36.100 --> 04:38.000]  So it's done one way or the other.
[04:38.260 --> 04:41.460]  Yeah, I would have been on pull the tooth after like four, I think.
[04:41.660 --> 04:43.100]  I don't think I would go seven and pull.
[04:43.580 --> 04:46.560]  The problem is I like the teeth that I have, you know?
[04:47.460 --> 04:51.880]  And I'm also I've also invested a lot of money in this tooth specifically.
[04:52.200 --> 04:52.980]  Yeah. You know what I mean?
[04:53.340 --> 04:55.600]  Yeah, it's a sunken cost fallacy, I guess.
[04:55.620 --> 04:58.880]  But I just I really I really feel like keeping the tooth around
[04:58.880 --> 05:00.180]  to get get my money's worth out of it.
[05:00.180 --> 05:04.760]  It's this weird, almost like investing in a car that you just need to let go of.
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.420]  But you put so much money into it.
[05:06.660 --> 05:07.760]  But seven is your walk away.
[05:08.200 --> 05:09.500]  Seven's a lucky number, Geoff.
[05:09.960 --> 05:11.320]  Yeah, number seven. That'll be it.
[05:11.380 --> 05:12.320]  That'll be the turnaround for you.
[05:12.400 --> 05:14.540]  You just need seven and then you'll be fine.
[05:14.980 --> 05:18.140]  Are you up more root canals on that tooth than Transformers movies?
[05:19.020 --> 05:20.460]  I think we're tied. Definitely.
[05:21.040 --> 05:24.000]  OK, I think once you go past Fast and Furious movies,
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.080]  that's when you pull the tooth.
[05:25.420 --> 05:28.740]  Yeah. Like right now, I'm still in the King Arthur's court
[05:29.440 --> 05:31.640]  level of Transformers, I think.
[05:31.840 --> 05:36.700]  But if if I get to Jason Statham getting into a fistfight
[05:36.700 --> 05:39.940]  while holding a baby on an airplane, then I'll know it's time to pull the tooth.
[05:40.640 --> 05:42.860]  It's the best part of that movie by a lot.
[05:43.060 --> 05:43.920]  I know. That's true.
[05:44.020 --> 05:46.040]  It's definitely easily the best sequence.
[05:46.240 --> 05:48.480]  Are we counting Hobbs and Shaw in the Fast and Furious?
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.860]  Yeah. OK, so you got you got a few to go still before you cross that line.
[05:52.140 --> 05:55.420]  Imagine if we were to count movies in which Jason Statham drives cars.
[05:55.520 --> 05:56.380]  And that's his thing.
[05:56.380 --> 05:57.500]  Oh, got her.
[05:58.180 --> 05:59.140]  Get the transporter.
[05:59.720 --> 06:01.820]  Is this Pleasantries or is this the episode?
[06:01.980 --> 06:03.300]  Oh, I think we've been in the episode for a while.
[06:03.300 --> 06:04.880]  We did an intro. Did we not?
[06:05.040 --> 06:06.480]  No, no. I can do one right now.
[06:06.900 --> 06:11.740]  Hello and welcome to the March 16th edition of the F*** Face podcast.
[06:12.060 --> 06:15.140]  I say that because when I came in for Pleasantries, Eric said this
[06:15.140 --> 06:16.800]  is this episode will air March 16th.
[06:16.800 --> 06:18.200]  But nobody said what number it is.
[06:18.340 --> 06:20.200]  So I don't know. I know we're in season four.
[06:20.560 --> 06:22.400]  What number? 94? It's 94.
[06:22.400 --> 06:28.980]  Episode 94 of season four, year two still.
[06:29.640 --> 06:30.420]  Are we still in year two?
[06:31.040 --> 06:32.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[06:32.460 --> 06:36.440]  So we're still in year two, season four, episode 94 of the F*** Face podcast.
[06:36.760 --> 06:40.940]  For reference, it was recorded on February 17th, 2022
[06:40.940 --> 06:43.920]  for airing on March 16th, 2022.
[06:44.200 --> 06:48.960]  I have no idea why I included all that, especially considering how much it hurts
[06:48.960 --> 06:52.440]  to talk. Eric asks, what did Andrew think the intro was?
[06:52.500 --> 06:54.680]  I just couldn't remember if it happened or not.
[06:54.720 --> 06:57.540]  Like we switched so many topics, we moved it to the tooth.
[06:57.880 --> 07:01.180]  I saw the message Eric messaged like at the beginning.
[07:01.620 --> 07:02.240]  Do the intro.
[07:02.540 --> 07:04.340]  And then I just couldn't remember if that actually happened.
[07:04.660 --> 07:05.800]  I just had no memory.
[07:05.920 --> 07:07.280]  I had no recollection of it.
[07:07.320 --> 07:09.140]  But we did it now, definitively.
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.420]  And while we're talking about bad movies, I feel like I should bring up
[07:12.420 --> 07:14.260]  a certain movie that I find. MVP?
[07:14.640 --> 07:17.060]  No, that's a great film. Matrix? Matrix.
[07:17.680 --> 07:18.320]  Thank you, Geoff.
[07:18.320 --> 07:21.920]  Yeah, I watched the I watched the most recent Matrix movie,
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.420]  which has been a point of contention.
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.240]  What's it called? Resurrection?
[07:26.900 --> 07:29.840]  I think so. I think it's Matrix Resurrections.
[07:30.120 --> 07:31.860]  Resurrection, something like that.
[07:31.880 --> 07:35.560]  But I hadn't seen it, and I largely had been avoiding seeing it
[07:35.560 --> 07:39.480]  because after Gavin watched it, he asked if I if I'd seen it.
[07:39.500 --> 07:42.580]  I said no. And he said, well, if you like that movie,
[07:42.580 --> 07:45.500]  we would cease to be friends and I would stop doing this show.
[07:45.560 --> 07:46.680]  That is how much I hate it.
[07:46.680 --> 07:50.020]  I don't think I've ever heard Gavin. I like how he gets more extreme every time you say it.
[07:50.300 --> 07:53.300]  No, it was it was that's been the bar you you've hated.
[07:53.440 --> 07:56.960]  I've never heard you hate anything like you've hated that movie.
[07:57.300 --> 07:58.860]  Oh, I'm not denying that I hate that movie.
[07:59.020 --> 08:01.900]  I was just surprised at how many people I spoke to about it liked it.
[08:01.980 --> 08:04.160]  So I was like, oh, which one? Which one will Andrew be?
[08:04.480 --> 08:09.000]  Well, because I texted you before you saw it asking if you had and you said no.
[08:09.060 --> 08:10.840]  And I said, oh, it's interesting. It's very divisive.
[08:10.920 --> 08:13.600]  People seem to either absolutely love it or hate it.
[08:13.700 --> 08:16.660]  There doesn't really seem to be much a middle for most people.
[08:16.660 --> 08:20.840]  And then like two days later, you saw it and you were like violently hated it.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.580]  Like the most aggressively hated any dog shit.
[08:26.220 --> 08:27.260]  So what were your thoughts?
[08:27.560 --> 08:28.800]  I think it might be.
[08:29.060 --> 08:31.460]  And there's a big caveat with this.
[08:31.840 --> 08:35.720]  I think it's my favorite Matrix movie of all of them.
[08:39.500 --> 08:42.880]  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that.
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.160]  Gavin just dropped from our car.
[08:45.360 --> 08:47.460]  Oh, he left. He's back.
[08:47.460 --> 08:49.280]  All right, I can figure out what to leave for.
[08:50.040 --> 08:50.980]  Let me. Was that enough?
[08:51.580 --> 08:52.260]  Yeah, that was good.
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.640]  It was, I think, really well done.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.300]  Let me just clarify a few things.
[08:55.600 --> 08:56.780]  I didn't love the first movie.
[08:56.980 --> 08:59.780]  I feel like I kind of missed out on that being like super cool.
[08:59.960 --> 09:02.940]  I just I saw it late and it was fine.
[09:03.020 --> 09:05.740]  I saw the two and three in theaters, didn't like them at all.
[09:05.940 --> 09:07.380]  I just thought they were boring as a kid.
[09:07.720 --> 09:10.460]  So I don't have a fandom for any of these movies.
[09:11.440 --> 09:15.720]  And you're completely correct in saying that like this most recent Matrix movie
[09:15.720 --> 09:16.960]  is super stupid.
[09:16.960 --> 09:18.060]  It's really dumb.
[09:18.260 --> 09:19.080]  It's ridiculous.
[09:19.500 --> 09:20.420]  But I just didn't care.
[09:20.500 --> 09:21.000]  I had fun with it.
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.720]  I just don't like the feel of it. It feels super low budget.
[09:22.860 --> 09:24.200]  It's like the most expensive one ever.
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.560]  But it just feels it looks so cheap looking.
[09:26.740 --> 09:27.080]  I don't know why.
[09:27.680 --> 09:29.520]  There is definitely a visual aesthetic.
[09:29.700 --> 09:33.180]  And also, I feel like that movie is designed to be a thing you hate more than
[09:33.180 --> 09:36.720]  anything I've ever seen, like with a lot of the choices in it as far as how meta
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.280]  it is. And it's just yeah, I loved it.
[09:40.820 --> 09:41.980]  Loved it maybe is a strong word.
[09:42.140 --> 09:43.260]  I really enjoyed it.
[09:43.620 --> 09:45.120]  I was like, wow, that wasn't bad at all.
[09:45.120 --> 09:47.060]  I feel bad that I like this.
[09:47.500 --> 09:48.860]  I wish we could be aligned.
[09:49.120 --> 09:51.620]  I enjoyed it to the point where I was still thinking about it.
[09:51.660 --> 09:52.900]  A few days later, I was like, you know what?
[09:52.980 --> 09:54.240]  That was really that was fine.
[09:54.340 --> 09:55.500]  Yeah, I was thinking about it, too.
[09:57.840 --> 09:59.660]  I guess I got to say it looks good.
[10:00.100 --> 10:01.460]  Yeah, it's like really dumb.
[10:01.500 --> 10:03.060]  And there's a lot of cringy things in it.
[10:03.100 --> 10:05.620]  But the things that are cringy, I feel like are by design.
[10:06.620 --> 10:08.820]  Like it's like fan service type shit.
[10:09.240 --> 10:12.660]  Some of the fan service stuff, as well as some of the dialogue choices.
[10:12.660 --> 10:17.000]  Like there's this really obnoxious, like gamer guy that's like MILF alert.
[10:17.160 --> 10:18.960]  And it's like super cringy.
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.700]  But it feels like that's what that character is like.
[10:22.700 --> 10:24.360]  I don't like that character, man.
[10:24.620 --> 10:25.480]  Yeah, like that.
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.080]  That unfortunately is a person that exists and they're in the movie.
[10:29.180 --> 10:31.420]  And it's not enjoyable, but it's not like that.
[10:31.440 --> 10:34.020]  They're accurately portraying that person.
[10:34.640 --> 10:38.160]  Do you hate lines such as I still know kung fu?
[10:38.300 --> 10:41.780]  That wasn't as upsetting to me as the way like it's the way that you said
[10:41.780 --> 10:46.120]  it was like he fucking juggled and like winked at the camera six times.
[10:46.300 --> 10:48.100]  And is this sort of as a passing moment?
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.160]  I was kind of disappointed by how not like it's on the nose.
[10:51.260 --> 10:52.880]  But I was expecting a whole other level.
[10:53.280 --> 10:56.820]  Or the Merovingian talking about Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg and stuff.
[10:57.100 --> 10:58.540]  I mean, that stuff just was like, whatever.
[10:58.680 --> 11:00.080]  They entered a weird. That's in the world.
[11:00.240 --> 11:03.200]  Beginning, the meta stuff of it is just strange where they go into that.
[11:03.300 --> 11:05.640]  It's like a video game and just the approach of like
[11:06.060 --> 11:09.060]  the start of that story is so self-referential.
[11:09.600 --> 11:14.520]  Gavin, do you maybe hate the movie a little bit because you're old?
[11:14.700 --> 11:16.060]  I don't a lot of people don't know this.
[11:16.460 --> 11:19.020]  Haven't known you forever, but your first aim name
[11:19.020 --> 11:20.960]  that we used to communicate with was Milf Alert.
[11:21.300 --> 11:21.580]  Do you feel?
[11:25.620 --> 11:28.640]  Oh, I wish so much of that was true.
[11:33.460 --> 11:34.420]  That's great.
[11:34.740 --> 11:35.620]  That's a great name.
[11:35.620 --> 11:39.280]  I would love to just see a chat log between like a press conference
[11:39.280 --> 11:42.300]  where it's a chat log between both alert and delicious boner.
[11:42.460 --> 11:44.600]  But a great, great combination.
[11:45.020 --> 11:49.180]  Have I ever told you the story about me and Bernie's first wife and delicious boner?
[11:49.600 --> 11:52.220]  No, no. It's a great combination of work.
[11:52.300 --> 11:53.260]  I was at work.
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.900]  What Andrew's referring to is my old aim name.
[11:55.980 --> 11:59.680]  We used to all communicate through AIM, AOL instant messenger a ton back in the day.
[11:59.800 --> 12:01.560]  That was like our preferred method of communique.
[12:01.980 --> 12:05.840]  And my my my aim name was delicious boner.
[12:06.540 --> 12:07.800]  Just because I thought that was name.
[12:08.160 --> 12:08.840]  It wasn't my first.
[12:08.840 --> 12:12.900]  I had to get rid of one because it leaked out and then too many community members
[12:12.900 --> 12:13.540]  were messaging me.
[12:13.620 --> 12:16.560]  And then I had one that was set sail for ass, which I thought was pretty funny.
[12:17.880 --> 12:19.960]  And then eventually I landed on delicious boner.
[12:20.180 --> 12:22.420]  I think my balls, your ass was on.
[12:22.420 --> 12:23.740]  My balls, your ass was on.
[12:23.960 --> 12:25.640]  Yeah, I changed. I had to change names a lot.
[12:25.700 --> 12:26.180]  They kept getting out.
[12:26.540 --> 12:28.020]  So anyway, delicious boner was my favorite.
[12:29.220 --> 12:31.900]  And Bernie was in Virginia visiting his dad.
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.660]  And he called me and he said, hey, I'm trying to teach my dad
[12:36.660 --> 12:37.920]  how to use instant messenger.
[12:37.920 --> 12:39.340]  Can I can I give you a call real fast?
[12:39.860 --> 12:40.980]  And I'm like, yeah, of course.
[12:41.220 --> 12:44.180]  And then I get a like, you know, message from Bernie Burns and I go, hello.
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.760]  And then I hear his wife.
[12:46.980 --> 12:50.620]  I hear it pop up and I hear his wife at the time go, oh, no.
[12:53.060 --> 12:56.020]  And I realized it was Bernie and his dad and our whole family
[12:56.020 --> 13:00.300]  around a computer looking at it, looking at a message from delicious boner.
[13:03.480 --> 13:05.940]  I think that was the longest lasting aim name you had.
[13:06.160 --> 13:07.380]  Yeah, I had it for a very long time.
[13:08.060 --> 13:10.600]  I forgot about some of those you mentioned, like my balls, your ass.
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.800]  That one wasn't as I was.
[13:12.940 --> 13:14.820]  I was Von Evil Satan for a while.
[13:15.280 --> 13:17.720]  Yeah, we had to change names a lot back in the day.
[13:17.960 --> 13:18.820]  It was a whole thing.
[13:19.480 --> 13:20.720]  Uh, evil Satan.
[13:21.140 --> 13:26.000]  I don't even remember why it was a inside baseball rooster teeth joke.
[13:26.140 --> 13:27.800]  I don't I don't remember where it came from or why.
[13:29.220 --> 13:33.160]  I I've been watching this MTV reality show from 2005,
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.060]  and it's been great, mainly for the T-shirt choices of that time period.
[13:37.380 --> 13:39.740]  As well as the prizes that these people are winning.
[13:40.120 --> 13:44.580]  And one of the prizes they won was the first smart shoe called Verb for Shoe.
[13:44.780 --> 13:48.140]  It was like, this is the first shoe that has the computer chip in it.
[13:48.220 --> 13:51.180]  It will inflate and deflate based off of your pressure.
[13:51.520 --> 13:53.360]  We will send you emails if it needs repair.
[13:53.500 --> 13:55.020]  Like it was this insane thing.
[13:55.040 --> 13:57.300]  And I was like, I've never fucking heard of Verb for Shoe.
[13:57.380 --> 13:57.940]  Like what happened?
[13:58.160 --> 14:01.240]  Almost all the prizes that were like wacky gadgets never actually existed,
[14:01.660 --> 14:02.900]  including Verb for Shoe.
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.580]  But in my research of it, it was invented by a guy named Ronald Demon,
[14:06.580 --> 14:07.980]  which made me really laugh.
[14:08.100 --> 14:11.440]  Just reading like Mr. Demon went like, it's just such a great casual,
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.680]  like fake sounding, like if a demon was going to inhabit the earth,
[14:14.800 --> 14:16.540]  like that'd be the shitty name they'd come up with.
[14:16.660 --> 14:17.660]  Like, ah, Ronald Demon.
[14:18.300 --> 14:20.460]  So it just failed or it like never was?
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.280]  It like they did like series of preorders for it from like 2004, then 2008.
[14:26.560 --> 14:29.740]  And then I just haven't found a single trace of it
[14:29.740 --> 14:32.040]  actually being manufactured or existing in any way.
[14:32.820 --> 14:35.380]  Which is why it's time that Uniform pick up the reins.
[14:35.380 --> 14:36.340]  Yeah, maybe.
[14:36.760 --> 14:39.560]  He's probably on a fucking beach in the Caribbean
[14:39.560 --> 14:41.120]  somewhere spending all that investment money.
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.860]  Hey, I don't I don't want to talk today much, but I realize after saying that
[14:46.860 --> 14:50.740]  I have three time sensitive things that we have to go over because we're already
[14:50.740 --> 14:52.280]  it's already March 16th, for Christ's sake.
[14:53.820 --> 14:57.460]  So at some point today, just before we end, I need to crowbar these things in.
[14:57.700 --> 14:58.440]  So anyway, continue.
[14:58.740 --> 15:00.920]  No, crowbar, crowbar away. I feel like it's out.
[15:01.000 --> 15:01.780]  Why don't you just go unpack?
[15:03.300 --> 15:04.720]  I don't think it's happened yet,
[15:04.720 --> 15:05.760]  but it may have.
[15:05.980 --> 15:07.820]  But if it did, then you saw it.
[15:07.920 --> 15:09.360]  But if it hasn't, you should check it out.
[15:09.860 --> 15:12.540]  We're testing out. I want to do I've long wanted to do.
[15:14.720 --> 15:17.200]  I've always wanted the lamest jobs in television.
[15:17.480 --> 15:20.760]  Like I always wanted to be Todd Bridges, but not in different strokes.
[15:20.920 --> 15:24.900]  I wanted to be Todd Bridges on like world's worst disasters and like sure.
[15:25.540 --> 15:27.480]  America's worst criminals where you just get to sit there
[15:27.480 --> 15:30.300]  and make one lame fucking joke that somebody else writes for you.
[15:30.320 --> 15:32.060]  And then you're like, can I have my two thousand dollars, you know?
[15:32.580 --> 15:35.440]  Uh, but I've also really wanted to be.
[15:35.800 --> 15:38.340]  And I think we've talked about this before in the past, maybe not on camera,
[15:38.340 --> 15:40.820]  but I always really wanted to be one of those knife guys
[15:40.820 --> 15:44.960]  who's on at like three in the morning on local television doing like it's like
[15:44.960 --> 15:49.040]  it's like the redneck version of QVC, where it's just like two old dudes
[15:49.040 --> 15:51.640]  with belt buckles and like a white, lazy Susan.
[15:51.820 --> 15:53.880]  And they just throw like a Rambo knife on it
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.660]  and then they talk about it for three minutes and it spins around and they sell it
[15:56.660 --> 15:59.420]  like, you know, and then they put on another knife and it's a bucket knife.
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.760]  And then, oh, yeah, there they are right there.
[16:01.760 --> 16:02.740]  I want to be the dude on the left.
[16:02.980 --> 16:04.840]  That's fucking great. We'll put that in the episode.
[16:06.320 --> 16:08.740]  Doing a terrible job so far. Thank you.
[16:09.360 --> 16:12.940]  And so I have a bunch of like remnant merchandise for like the Geoff line.
[16:13.260 --> 16:16.020]  If you're not a if you're just a regulation listener
[16:16.020 --> 16:18.060]  and you don't participate in the rest. Oh, hello, Henry.
[16:18.480 --> 16:19.940]  You don't participate in the rest of Rooster Teeth.
[16:20.100 --> 16:22.200]  I have like a clothing line that's been around for a couple of years.
[16:22.440 --> 16:24.020]  And so I have a bunch of crap that didn't sell.
[16:24.200 --> 16:27.600]  And I thought, like, let me sell it like QVC style, like live sale.
[16:27.640 --> 16:29.920]  It would be like a fun, like infomercial kind of thing.
[16:30.480 --> 16:33.300]  And so they we set that up and it may have already happened,
[16:33.420 --> 16:34.360]  but it hasn't already happened.
[16:34.480 --> 16:37.220]  I'm very excited to announce to you, too, because I think this is very funny.
[16:37.500 --> 16:38.860]  They told me I had to come up with a name
[16:38.860 --> 16:42.780]  and then they gave me a list of potential names like Geoff's garage sale
[16:42.780 --> 16:45.160]  and Geoff's, you know, spring cleaning.
[16:45.520 --> 16:48.820]  And and I came up with everything must go.
[16:49.040 --> 16:51.720]  Go now. Yeah, that's great.
[16:51.920 --> 16:54.960]  Is that the best name I've ever come up with in my entire life?
[16:55.160 --> 16:57.340]  Yeah. Everything must go. Go now.
[16:57.740 --> 16:58.620]  Yeah. Holy shit.
[16:58.620 --> 17:02.640]  I wish I could sell the name that is such a I'm so fucking proud of myself.
[17:02.880 --> 17:05.620]  Well, now we know the name of all future face sales.
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.420]  Yeah. All sales now are going to be everything must go. Go now.
[17:08.480 --> 17:12.220]  I'm so I'm just so tickled with me because of that name.
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.160]  We can put that at the top of the face flops section of the website.
[17:16.380 --> 17:17.520]  I love it. I love it.
[17:17.560 --> 17:20.260]  Dude, speaking of not flops, that frickin porta potty mug.
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.560]  Oh, yeah, it's finally we're finally doing pretty well.
[17:22.600 --> 17:24.260]  I think when, yo, you know what?
[17:24.540 --> 17:27.140]  Very quietly, I should I should mention.
[17:27.140 --> 17:30.980]  I noticed in the check in on the sales on the on the porta potty mug,
[17:31.140 --> 17:34.040]  which you guys supported in a big way, and we cannot thank you enough.
[17:34.380 --> 17:38.240]  And I hope that if you decide to piss or shit in it or drink in it
[17:38.240 --> 17:40.520]  or store baseball cards in it like I've been doing,
[17:41.120 --> 17:44.400]  I hope that you enjoy it to the fullest of its capacity
[17:44.400 --> 17:48.760]  because it's a fantastic piece of merchandise that we will never make again.
[17:49.440 --> 17:50.260]  So thank you. If you got one.
[17:50.320 --> 17:52.860]  Thank you so much for supporting us in the process of that, though.
[17:53.040 --> 17:54.200]  They bought all the skateboards.
[17:54.400 --> 17:56.380]  Oh, yeah. So now we've got no flops.
[17:56.380 --> 17:57.380]  Yeah, we got no flops.
[17:57.560 --> 17:59.060]  Oh, shit. I don't know.
[17:59.220 --> 18:02.880]  Flopless. And which segues into the number two thing.
[18:03.240 --> 18:05.820]  This is now this joke's now over a month old.
[18:06.280 --> 18:11.180]  But we in our time, the time that we're recording this last week,
[18:11.200 --> 18:12.660]  we recorded a face break shit.
[18:13.900 --> 18:16.820]  And, you know, Gavin, you couldn't be there because of prior obligations.
[18:16.880 --> 18:20.500]  So it was me and Eric and Andrew and Emily, as always.
[18:21.240 --> 18:24.080]  And we debuted some of the some of the sounds on the soundboard.
[18:24.180 --> 18:24.880]  That was pretty exciting.
[18:25.540 --> 18:26.900]  Gavin's Oh, no, was on there.
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.060]  But right before there, the reason we recorded it in the old location
[18:33.060 --> 18:36.400]  and not the new location is because I had to make a video for Achievement
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.760]  Hunter with Jack for the Super Bowl.
[18:38.300 --> 18:40.460]  And so they were like, well, let's just move our production over here
[18:40.460 --> 18:43.340]  to make it easier on Achievement Hunter and Jack, which we did.
[18:43.720 --> 18:46.400]  And then Jack was supposed to jump on, finally jump on the break show
[18:46.960 --> 18:49.740]  right after that because they two butted up against each other.
[18:49.780 --> 18:52.900]  And I turned around and that motherfucker was in his car driving away.
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.640]  I couldn't believe it.
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.240]  He was even in the description for the break show.
[18:58.580 --> 19:02.160]  I looked at social the fucking marketing team even advertised it
[19:02.160 --> 19:05.740]  as Jack being in there and the guy and the son of a bitch took off.
[19:05.860 --> 19:07.980]  He Matt Damon to me or like a reverse Matt Damon.
[19:09.680 --> 19:12.400]  And and so I got so annoyed.
[19:13.060 --> 19:16.160]  I took that photo of him that I have taped to the side of the bin
[19:16.160 --> 19:19.000]  that I bring the baseball cards in the one that he made.
[19:19.220 --> 19:20.300]  He made it of himself.
[19:20.440 --> 19:22.780]  It's like Jack with a big ass like Louis C.K.
[19:22.780 --> 19:26.440]  bald head because he was he made it for a contest or something years ago.
[19:26.880 --> 19:30.020]  So I put it on a fucking shirt and we sold it.
[19:30.600 --> 19:33.480]  And I said we would sell it until he finds out about it.
[19:33.600 --> 19:36.580]  And then so all I did was post on Instagram an Instagram story
[19:36.580 --> 19:37.400]  on the Facebook account.
[19:37.540 --> 19:38.780]  Just don't tell Jack.
[19:38.900 --> 19:40.800]  But if you have any interest in this, you can get it.
[19:40.800 --> 19:42.460]  If not, I don't give a fuck. Don't buy it.
[19:42.580 --> 19:43.580]  It's I'm not trying to get you to buy it.
[19:43.600 --> 19:44.480]  I'm just telling it's available. Right.
[19:44.840 --> 19:48.240]  And it managed to be up from Friday to Monday before he noticed.
[19:49.240 --> 19:51.520]  And we sold hundreds of them.
[19:52.080 --> 19:54.300]  How? How did he notice?
[19:54.600 --> 19:57.160]  How did he did he find out himself? Do you know how it was discovered?
[19:57.540 --> 19:59.600]  I don't know. I just got a I just got a text from him.
[19:59.800 --> 20:02.320]  It's like it just said, like, somebody told me.
[20:02.400 --> 20:05.000]  So I took it down.
[20:05.240 --> 20:09.720]  But it was an I was even thinking I should create like, well,
[20:09.720 --> 20:11.960]  I can't say it on the podcast because he'll hear it.
[20:12.300 --> 20:13.460]  Let me just say I'm not done.
[20:14.080 --> 20:17.880]  And I hope Jack pisses me off again because I have other I have other ideas.
[20:18.060 --> 20:20.740]  And I'm talking to you regulation listeners and I'm talking to you
[20:20.740 --> 20:21.240]  comment leavers.
[20:21.440 --> 20:23.120]  I don't know how to get this information to you
[20:23.120 --> 20:26.860]  because he listens to this fucking podcast because he's a he's a big ass fan.
[20:27.260 --> 20:30.600]  So I'll find some other way to communicate with you
[20:30.600 --> 20:34.440]  because the next time he steps over the line, I've got I've got plans
[20:34.440 --> 20:36.080]  to put in place. It's going to be one.
[20:36.320 --> 20:39.160]  I just love the idea of stuff being on sale,
[20:39.200 --> 20:41.300]  depending on how much you happen to like Jack.
[20:42.680 --> 20:44.260]  Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[20:44.640 --> 20:46.880]  Is it just this thing now that he just will never be on it?
[20:47.180 --> 20:50.280]  I don't know, dude. He's I mean, I think he was dodging
[20:50.280 --> 20:52.020]  obligation and work, you know?
[20:52.160 --> 20:55.000]  He was like, well, that's the that's what I'm paid to do from nine to five.
[20:55.100 --> 20:57.620]  So, uh, fuck them.
[20:58.660 --> 21:00.060]  Anyway, that was the second thing.
[21:00.120 --> 21:04.020]  And then the third thing is, Andrew, you sent me a troubling tweet
[21:04.020 --> 21:05.800]  the other day, and I'd like to I'd like to know why.
[21:06.320 --> 21:07.800]  Oh, you want to talk about?
[21:07.960 --> 21:13.420]  Yeah, you tweeted to me and you said only I consider this a declaration of war.
[21:13.720 --> 21:15.240]  Well, I'll post it in.
[21:15.500 --> 21:18.840]  So I got Geoff mailed me a thing out of the kindness
[21:19.520 --> 21:20.760]  of his heart, apparently.
[21:20.900 --> 21:23.840]  I thought this was I didn't know how to interpret it at first.
[21:23.940 --> 21:25.280]  I didn't know what was coming.
[21:25.680 --> 21:27.200]  It was in a giant bag.
[21:27.280 --> 21:28.660]  It was very Santa like.
[21:29.060 --> 21:30.440]  The it doesn't look that big in the photo.
[21:30.980 --> 21:31.980]  Oh, it's huge.
[21:32.260 --> 21:33.560]  It's I know. I know.
[21:33.940 --> 21:35.040]  It's like a sack.
[21:35.100 --> 21:37.800]  It is genuinely like a Santa sack sized bag.
[21:37.940 --> 21:40.560]  And I was like, oh, Geoff is so Geoff is so sweet.
[21:40.800 --> 21:42.440]  You send a thing. He sent a card.
[21:42.520 --> 21:44.180]  I don't have a photo of that, but it was like something.
[21:44.320 --> 21:45.740]  It was it was a nice little message.
[21:45.740 --> 21:50.440]  It was during when as at the peak of like issues with my ankle.
[21:51.180 --> 21:54.560]  And then so I opened the sack, which took a long time.
[21:54.640 --> 21:55.760]  I didn't I didn't tell you this.
[21:55.860 --> 22:00.640]  It took me genuinely like three minutes to undo the ribbons on this fucking sack
[22:00.640 --> 22:03.780]  because it was like quadruple knotted on both sides.
[22:04.140 --> 22:07.100]  And I'd like loosen one side and then the other side would get tighter.
[22:07.360 --> 22:08.240]  It was a nightmare.
[22:08.580 --> 22:10.460]  So I finally it is.
[22:10.540 --> 22:14.000]  So I finally I open the sack and then I have this.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.080]  I have this small box in this giant fucking bag.
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.900]  And I'm like, what is this?
[22:18.940 --> 22:19.700]  Now it's a box.
[22:19.960 --> 22:22.040]  This is like it's still kind of like exciting.
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.420]  What could it possibly be?
[22:23.560 --> 22:28.320]  So then I finally open the box and you just sent me a giant fucking thing.
[22:28.380 --> 22:31.160]  A bubble wrap to, I guess, protect my foot.
[22:31.360 --> 22:32.460]  Yeah. Wrap my foot in.
[22:32.640 --> 22:33.280]  Here's the thing.
[22:33.540 --> 22:34.980]  Let me explain. Let me explain.
[22:35.040 --> 22:37.560]  Not to wrap your foot, although you you reserve the right to do that.
[22:38.240 --> 22:39.060]  Here's the thing.
[22:39.840 --> 22:43.320]  You and Gavin at the at the same time, we're both having problems in your lives.
[22:43.320 --> 22:45.060]  And I've I've addressed both of them.
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.240]  Gavin, you don't know this yet.
[22:46.980 --> 22:48.200]  No, I've got the package.
[22:48.580 --> 22:49.560]  Oh, you got the mail. OK.
[22:49.700 --> 22:52.120]  I got I stepped over on the way in today.
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.700]  So, Gavin, you had a particular issue.
[22:55.820 --> 22:56.500]  God damn it, Henry.
[22:56.860 --> 22:58.060]  You had a particular issue.
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.460]  And Andrew, you had a particular issue.
[23:00.500 --> 23:04.000]  And I thought, like, let me put my uniform hat on and let me invent
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.600]  some ways to help you.
[23:05.860 --> 23:08.440]  And I'll be honest, I'm just a little down on ideas right now.
[23:08.500 --> 23:09.780]  I'm not feeling super creative.
[23:09.820 --> 23:11.940]  And I thought, I bet I bet solutions exist.
[23:12.000 --> 23:13.080]  Let me be creative with those.
[23:13.080 --> 23:15.980]  So, Andrew, I worry about you falling a lot.
[23:16.180 --> 23:18.060]  You and my great grandma, I worry.
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.400]  Well, she's dead, but my grandma, you and my grandma, I worry about falling constantly.
[23:21.820 --> 23:26.380]  And so for you, I bought you one hundred and twenty five feet of bubble wrap
[23:26.380 --> 23:30.940]  that you can bubble wrap every hard or sharp edge in your apartment.
[23:31.600 --> 23:35.620]  And then if there's enough left over, wrap it around your ankle or lay it on the floor.
[23:35.760 --> 23:39.260]  So when you fall, you fall into a cushion because it's kind of a given
[23:39.260 --> 23:40.440]  that you will fall again.
[23:40.440 --> 23:44.000]  I would. I'm just waiting for the time that you fall and impale your neck
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.120]  on a sharp corner or something.
[23:45.360 --> 23:48.400]  So I want to I know where you have to bike me to the hospital.
[23:48.740 --> 23:50.100]  Isn't that what happened? Maybe? Yeah.
[23:50.740 --> 23:51.840]  Yeah, right. I did.
[23:51.940 --> 23:53.800]  I biked him home and then his parents took me to the hospital.
[23:54.760 --> 23:57.800]  I I want desperately to keep you safe.
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.920]  And so I want to Andrew proof your apartment.
[24:01.560 --> 24:04.000]  I also sent you a got returned, so I apologize for this.
[24:04.080 --> 24:05.020]  I can resend it if you'd like.
[24:05.260 --> 24:08.820]  I bought you like eight like eight K
[24:09.380 --> 24:12.940]  like schools of I don't know what you call it, of packing tape.
[24:13.300 --> 24:16.040]  So I've got a shitload of packing tape, but I guess for some reason,
[24:16.120 --> 24:17.500]  Amazon couldn't deliver your packing tape.
[24:17.820 --> 24:20.200]  You were stuttering there like you couldn't get through that sentence.
[24:20.420 --> 24:22.520]  But Henry was also squeezing at the same time.
[24:22.640 --> 24:24.560]  So it sounded like a skipped record.
[24:24.920 --> 24:26.660]  I was searching for a word.
[24:26.980 --> 24:30.640]  Henry was distracting me and the pain is intense in my mouth.
[24:31.040 --> 24:31.960]  They didn't have the pain.
[24:32.100 --> 24:36.200]  They had my antibiotics ready at the at the pharmacy, but not the pain meds.
[24:36.200 --> 24:37.140]  Oh, I haven't gotten them yet.
[24:37.140 --> 24:38.260]  Well, you can keep the tape.
[24:38.900 --> 24:40.580]  It's OK. That's very kind of you, though.
[24:41.100 --> 24:41.760]  Yeah, that way.
[24:41.900 --> 24:45.660]  Just so like to just just wrap everything in three layers of bubble
[24:45.660 --> 24:47.320]  tape or bubble wrap, and you're going to be fine.
[24:47.880 --> 24:48.220]  Awesome.
[24:48.620 --> 24:50.060]  Shall I post a picture of what you sent me?
[24:50.520 --> 24:51.640]  I'd love to see what he's saying.
[24:52.220 --> 24:53.660]  I don't even. What is that?
[24:53.780 --> 24:54.500]  Yeah, what is that?
[24:54.700 --> 24:55.760]  That's not all I sent you either.
[24:56.080 --> 24:58.680]  No, he said he also sent me a cucumber, which was lovely.
[24:59.620 --> 25:02.620]  Mostly, mostly new and only partially used.
[25:04.600 --> 25:06.540]  Cucumber with like the third of it missing.
[25:06.540 --> 25:08.040]  Well, like maybe a quarter or a half.
[25:08.740 --> 25:12.220]  And this, from what I can tell, is a device
[25:12.220 --> 25:16.440]  that you put over the top of a doorknob with and it grips it
[25:16.440 --> 25:17.960]  to make it like a door handle.
[25:18.420 --> 25:20.360]  Yes. Yes, I got you.
[25:20.400 --> 25:21.320]  And it's portable.
[25:21.940 --> 25:23.340]  It's like it's like throw it in your pocket.
[25:23.580 --> 25:27.020]  And then whenever you are out about around town or in a different country
[25:27.020 --> 25:30.960]  and you encounter something as offensive to you as a doorknob,
[25:31.100 --> 25:35.580]  you can pull that puppy out, slap it on and and all your fears
[25:35.580 --> 25:40.420]  and hatred and anger will melt away in the hands of a strong plastic
[25:40.420 --> 25:44.620]  or rubber, I guess, rubber, strong rubberized door handle.
[25:45.200 --> 25:45.840]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[25:45.980 --> 25:49.560]  I don't have any doorknobs to test it on as we've established.
[25:49.700 --> 25:51.280]  And obviously they're illegal in Vancouver.
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.620]  So, yeah, probably won't be using them there.
[25:53.720 --> 25:55.200]  But I'm going to keep one in my pocket.
[25:55.500 --> 25:56.700]  Yeah, you travel a lot. Yeah.
[25:57.120 --> 25:58.760]  That's such a great... I didn't know that was the thing.
[25:58.800 --> 25:59.480]  That was very kind.
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.520]  And you know what? No kindness should go without return, Geoff.
[26:03.520 --> 26:06.520]  So I hope you know that we can't or at least I can't.
[26:06.540 --> 26:07.320]  I won't speak for Gavin.
[26:07.600 --> 26:11.920]  I can't wait to return the favor to you and make sure that you also just understand
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.500]  how much I appreciated the bubble wrap and do something kind right back at you.
[26:15.500 --> 26:19.280]  One could argue that you already showed me that level of affection
[26:19.280 --> 26:23.460]  with a porta potty a year ago, and this is me making up for that.
[26:23.760 --> 26:25.600]  So there's no need. There's no need.
[26:25.840 --> 26:28.080]  No, this was this is a different year.
[26:28.280 --> 26:30.580]  It's doesn't it's a year thing, changed years.
[26:30.740 --> 26:32.380]  So I think it's this is a different gift.
[26:32.760 --> 26:34.800]  I have to return the favor to you.
[26:36.120 --> 26:39.560]  And you know, it's I appreciate your kindness and I can assure you
[26:39.560 --> 26:40.800]  it will be equally matched.
[26:41.020 --> 26:43.760]  And I hope you enjoy whatever that happens.
[26:43.980 --> 26:45.300]  You got to make sure it's a good gift.
[26:45.620 --> 26:46.160]  Thank you.
[26:46.160 --> 26:47.300]  Because it's not what you did. It's thoughtful.
[26:48.180 --> 26:50.260]  Oh, that could be a good one.
[26:50.280 --> 26:51.620]  We'll see. It has to be sweet.
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.780]  It'll be a sweet, thoughtful thing that Geoff loves.
[26:54.900 --> 26:56.080]  And I can't wait.
[26:56.180 --> 26:57.660]  Can't wait to return the kindness.
[27:00.800 --> 27:02.700]  I really shouldn't. You don't have to.
[27:02.920 --> 27:04.540]  No, I can't wait to do it.
[27:04.560 --> 27:05.180]  It's going to be great.
[27:05.260 --> 27:06.660]  I don't give gifts to get them.
[27:07.040 --> 27:10.520]  I it's done out of just the best part of getting it.
[27:10.580 --> 27:14.120]  Kindness is being able to send someone else a gift in return.
[27:14.380 --> 27:16.820]  Oh, no, the giving is the joy.
[27:17.500 --> 27:19.780]  So the best part of giving a gift is the gift.
[27:19.900 --> 27:22.100]  The best part for you is receiving the receiving.
[27:22.360 --> 27:24.100]  Oh, the best part for me is returning.
[27:24.360 --> 27:26.040]  I know you're a receiver, Andrew.
[27:26.260 --> 27:27.640]  You're like a natural born giver.
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.360]  You're one who receives, you're one who collects.
[27:32.740 --> 27:36.740]  Who? Who? Who? Yes, it takes it takes into your arms.
[27:36.860 --> 27:39.300]  Whereas I am. I'm one who pushes and shoves at you.
[27:39.920 --> 27:43.260]  I wish I could remember who said this and give them the credit.
[27:43.380 --> 27:46.960]  Somebody reached out to me and they brought up that I am a stormer
[27:46.960 --> 27:50.660]  because I stormed out of my room when you bought all the shit at my birthday
[27:50.660 --> 27:52.120]  that I had to just keep going out of.
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.360]  So there is there is a documented storm of me on this show.
[27:56.360 --> 27:58.660]  So I guess I am a stormer. I have stormed.
[27:58.740 --> 28:01.020]  There you go. But you were you weren't storming out.
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.200]  You were storming towards something. Yeah, I was storming in.
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.380]  I'm an aggressive storm, I guess.
[28:06.540 --> 28:08.400]  I go after I'm not away. I pursue.
[28:08.880 --> 28:11.900]  I was I was reading the comments on the one that just came out.
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.800]  And the audience pointed out something based on this part of the conversation.
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.740]  Does Randy Savage begin or where does you know what I mean?
[28:21.740 --> 28:23.420]  And Macho Man end?
[28:23.420 --> 28:28.540]  Like, is there like how different is he at home on right now
[28:28.540 --> 28:31.280]  in his living room watching CNN or?
[28:32.340 --> 28:35.500]  Yeah. Did you know he's been dead for over a decade or what?
[28:36.880 --> 28:38.180]  I'll I'll say this.
[28:39.860 --> 28:44.640]  The producer of this show fucking knew, I guarantee you, and he spoke up.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.980]  Yeah, I I knew and we talked about it and I thought you were making a joke.
[28:49.080 --> 28:52.100]  I think if you were to listen to my audio, you say that.
[28:52.100 --> 28:53.760]  And then I probably go, what?
[28:53.880 --> 28:56.300]  And laugh, but it's not in this episode.
[28:56.560 --> 29:00.280]  Oh, you just find that because it was you.
[29:00.900 --> 29:03.820]  It's saying watching CNN, right?
[29:03.940 --> 29:05.800]  Like at his house right now. Right now.
[29:06.020 --> 29:07.860]  Like right now.
[29:08.120 --> 29:09.620]  Oh, I didn't know he was dead.
[29:10.240 --> 29:11.240]  I wasn't ready to go.
[29:11.720 --> 29:14.000]  Or if I knew he was dead, I forgot about it.
[29:14.200 --> 29:17.820]  But I think the point of the of the the point I was trying to make still stands
[29:17.820 --> 29:20.940]  was all right. Rest in peace, Randy Savage.
[29:20.940 --> 29:22.100]  I'm so sorry to hear you.
[29:22.380 --> 29:24.760]  Miss Elizabeth and I both, I'm sure, are crestfallen.
[29:25.320 --> 29:26.460]  I think she's dead, too.
[29:27.160 --> 29:27.980]  Are you fucking serious?
[29:28.480 --> 29:30.580]  I'm pretty sure she's been dead way longer.
[29:31.080 --> 29:33.460]  Yes. I think she died way longer than he did.
[29:33.660 --> 29:35.480]  What about the snake? Is the snake alive?
[29:35.960 --> 29:37.340]  Jake, the snake is still good.
[29:37.560 --> 29:38.860]  Jake, the snake is alive.
[29:39.160 --> 29:41.500]  Damien, the snake was not actually one snake.
[29:41.560 --> 29:43.440]  There were a bunch of different snakes and most are dead. Yes.
[29:43.860 --> 29:45.240]  Oh, man. All right.
[29:45.260 --> 29:46.780]  Well, anyway, rest in peace.
[29:46.880 --> 29:47.720]  Macho man, Randy Savage.
[29:48.420 --> 29:49.340]  I'm not going to ask you.
[29:49.340 --> 29:50.160]  There's so many other people.
[29:50.260 --> 29:51.700]  I want to know if they're dead now, but I guess they are.
[29:51.800 --> 29:54.940]  I guess if I can name a name that I remember from the 80s associated
[29:54.940 --> 29:55.920]  with wrestling, they're dead.
[29:55.980 --> 29:58.360]  Could you could you just name one name for me, please, Geoff?
[29:58.700 --> 29:59.760]  Manny Fernandez, the Flying Burrito.
[30:00.480 --> 30:01.420]  Thank you. That's a thing.
[30:01.680 --> 30:03.500]  My favorite wrestler when I was a kid growing up.
[30:03.740 --> 30:07.080]  Followed closely by Dusty Rhodes and then by the Road Warriors.
[30:07.260 --> 30:09.200]  And then when they hooked up and it became the Legion of Doom,
[30:09.400 --> 30:11.520]  that was like it would have been one of my first bonus.
[30:11.520 --> 30:12.480]  Oh shit, there's so many. Thanks.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.400]  Yeah, I mean, like I'm pretty sure Manny Fernandez is still alive.
[30:16.500 --> 30:18.380]  I just I remember him as the Raging Bull.
[30:20.060 --> 30:22.240]  It like N.W.A. or whatever.
[30:22.480 --> 30:25.500]  Yeah. One half of the Road Warriors is dead.
[30:25.700 --> 30:27.020]  So who died, Hawk or Animal?
[30:27.820 --> 30:29.440]  Hawk. Animal's still alive, I think.
[30:29.560 --> 30:31.260]  Oh, that's sad. That's sad.
[30:31.380 --> 30:34.620]  Wait, the animal. Maybe maybe he did die not too long ago.
[30:34.980 --> 30:37.140]  Hawk was the smart one. Animal was the angrier one.
[30:37.560 --> 30:38.820]  Yeah. He was more rage.
[30:39.060 --> 30:41.700]  Oh, no. Yeah. In 2020, Animal died.
[30:42.260 --> 30:44.120]  So the Hawk has been. Yeah, they're both dead.
[30:44.160 --> 30:45.960]  Fucking hell, dude. Yeah.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.540]  Oh, anyway, I still think the point still stands.
[30:49.640 --> 30:52.780]  Is that I was trying to get to is was Randy Savage
[30:52.780 --> 30:55.820]  the macho man at home when he was kicking up his feet,
[30:55.920 --> 30:57.040]  drinking a beer and watching TV?
[30:57.080 --> 31:00.080]  Or was it a persona he put on? Right? Yeah.
[31:00.380 --> 31:02.880]  I just wonder where like the character ends and begins.
[31:02.940 --> 31:07.240]  I apologize. I wasn't up on my on my dead celebrities.
[31:07.460 --> 31:09.240]  But I'll just go and say this.
[31:09.660 --> 31:13.120]  If we talk about a wrestler, chances are they're dead. Yeah.
[31:13.780 --> 31:15.460]  That's fair. Especially from that era.
[31:15.460 --> 31:17.940]  Yeah. The high probability, for sure. Yeah.
[31:18.380 --> 31:19.440]  I don't think your point was wrong.
[31:19.540 --> 31:20.740]  I think your point is completely valid.
[31:20.840 --> 31:22.940]  It was just the phrasing was definitely odd. For sure.
[31:23.080 --> 31:26.320]  I think at the time I registered as I thought, well, he's dead.
[31:26.340 --> 31:28.620]  But it didn't you know, like it didn't register enough.
[31:28.740 --> 31:29.600]  I understood what you were saying.
[31:29.900 --> 31:31.840]  I didn't feel the need to correct.
[31:32.520 --> 31:35.900]  Also, he's he's a mortal as he lives on through his music.
[31:36.340 --> 31:36.880]  That is true.
[31:42.310 --> 31:45.850]  A lot of people didn't even bother making resolutions this year.
[31:45.930 --> 31:47.210]  And you know what? I get it.
[31:47.210 --> 31:50.730]  But it doesn't mean you shouldn't still find a way to shake things up,
[31:50.730 --> 31:53.770]  whether it's by switching your workout routine or going someplace new.
[31:54.270 --> 31:56.530]  Whatever way you challenge yourself this new year,
[31:56.630 --> 31:59.050]  there's no better way to do it than with a pair of Raycon
[31:59.050 --> 32:01.090]  wireless earbuds in your ears.
[32:01.210 --> 32:03.470]  Why your ears? Where else would you put them?
[32:03.730 --> 32:04.970]  Ears are where they go.
[32:05.350 --> 32:07.270]  And speaking of your ears, they're going to love them
[32:07.270 --> 32:11.070]  because the everyday earbuds look, feel and sound better than ever.
[32:11.410 --> 32:13.850]  Seriously, put other stuff in your ear and then put that in your ear
[32:13.850 --> 32:15.270]  and you'll go, oh, this one makes sense.
[32:15.270 --> 32:18.610]  There's also an awareness mode for when you need to listen to your surroundings,
[32:18.670 --> 32:19.650]  like when you're riding a bike.
[32:19.850 --> 32:23.150]  So you can take Raycons with you wherever you go and be safe
[32:23.150 --> 32:26.970]  with optimized gel tips for the perfect in ear fit.
[32:27.130 --> 32:31.550]  These earbuds are so comfortable and they will not budge.
[32:31.690 --> 32:35.010]  It's like getting an ear massage while you're treating yourself
[32:35.010 --> 32:39.370]  to some lovely music or a book on tape or angry political talk.
[32:39.790 --> 32:43.470]  Raycons offer eight hours of playtime and a 32 hour battery life
[32:43.470 --> 32:45.290]  and they're priced just right.
[32:45.390 --> 32:50.110]  You get quality audio at half the price of other premium audio brands.
[32:50.590 --> 32:55.230]  It's no wonder that Raycons everyday earbuds have over 48,000 five star reviews.
[32:55.390 --> 32:56.250]  That's out of five, too.
[32:56.490 --> 32:58.690]  That's not five stars out of 10 or 20 or 30 or 40.
[32:58.930 --> 32:59.830]  That's five out of five.

[33:17.090 --> 33:18.790]  The time for spring cleaning is upon us.
[33:18.870 --> 33:22.470]  You clean out your garage, your pantry, your bedroom closets,
[33:22.830 --> 33:25.770]  but do more than just dust cabinets and organize.
[33:26.290 --> 33:29.370]  Clean your butthole, too, with Hello Tushy bidets.
[33:29.610 --> 33:31.510]  It's been a long winter up there.
[33:31.630 --> 33:33.090]  We need to freshen it up.
[33:33.390 --> 33:36.930]  So after wiping with dry and scratchy toilet paper for the last
[33:36.930 --> 33:41.270]  God knows how long, our bums could use a serious refresh.
[33:41.270 --> 33:45.610]  Put your cleanest booty forward and start washing with Hello Tushy.
[33:45.730 --> 33:47.350]  Imagine that you're walking down the street.
[33:48.650 --> 33:50.390]  That's what I sound like when I walk down the street.
[33:50.650 --> 33:54.290]  You might sound like this, or maybe you sound like this.
[33:54.550 --> 33:56.050]  A dee-ba-da-da-doo-da-doo.
[33:56.410 --> 33:57.970]  I don't know. Everybody walks different.
[33:58.270 --> 33:59.590]  But imagine that you're doing that,
[34:00.870 --> 34:02.990]  and a bird poops all over your arm.
[34:03.210 --> 34:05.250]  Are you just going to pat it off with a dry napkin?
[34:05.390 --> 34:06.170]  I hope not.
[34:06.310 --> 34:08.810]  You're going to stick it in a toilet and wash it with a bidet
[34:08.810 --> 34:11.070]  because you need to clean with water.
[34:11.270 --> 34:13.010]  And why are we treating our buttholes differently?
[34:13.330 --> 34:15.970]  Stop smearing your business around with toilet paper
[34:15.970 --> 34:20.830]  like it's some sort of a kid's finger painting and start washing with water.
[34:21.170 --> 34:22.830]  Use the Hello Tushy bidet.
[34:23.410 --> 34:24.650]  It's 2022, people.
[34:25.050 --> 34:27.130]  Get technological. Get cleaner.
[34:27.670 --> 34:30.790]  Stop spreading your business around your butthole with toilet paper
[34:30.790 --> 34:35.370]  and start eliminating it with Hello Tushy bidets and water.
[34:35.810 --> 34:38.290]  I want all of our listeners to have clean buttholes.

[34:57.530 --> 34:59.690]  Can I can I pivot to something for a minute?
[34:59.790 --> 35:03.110]  I had please. I had quite the quite the story.
[35:03.190 --> 35:03.990]  We're going to go on a journey.
[35:04.050 --> 35:05.330]  We're going to start. It's going to seem
[35:06.670 --> 35:08.010]  like we're going to get to a weird place,
[35:08.130 --> 35:11.310]  but it's needed for the context because I think it adds to the story.
[35:11.630 --> 35:17.290]  So like last week, one year, it was the one year since my grandma had passed.
[35:17.430 --> 35:19.910]  And so I was like spending time with my mom for dinner.
[35:20.030 --> 35:21.690]  It's her mom, my grandma, very close.
[35:21.950 --> 35:23.910]  And we're having this like emotional dinner.
[35:24.010 --> 35:24.750]  We lit a candle.
[35:24.990 --> 35:26.490]  We're talking about things.
[35:26.930 --> 35:29.190]  And then the conversation kind of pivoted.
[35:29.330 --> 35:31.830]  And she my mom loves like watching shows and whatnot.
[35:31.970 --> 35:34.010]  She's a very like she doesn't curse.
[35:34.010 --> 35:37.270]  She grew up super religious, like a Martha Stewart type person.
[35:38.750 --> 35:39.630]  So we're talking.
[35:39.750 --> 35:43.790]  She's like, yeah, I've been watching this thing on Netflix or I don't remember
[35:43.790 --> 35:45.390]  what was on. I think B.J.
[35:45.490 --> 35:46.450]  Novak is in it.
[35:46.750 --> 35:50.250]  And it was the guy that was on Lost and Hawaii Five-O.
[35:50.430 --> 35:51.530]  And I was like, Locke?
[35:51.530 --> 35:52.310]  She's like, no.
[35:52.770 --> 35:54.390]  So Hurley? No.
[35:54.530 --> 35:55.210]  And it's like, Jin?
[35:55.490 --> 35:56.470]  Yeah, Daniel Dae Kim.
[35:56.690 --> 35:57.470]  That's who it was. Yeah.
[35:57.790 --> 35:59.690]  Daniel Dae Kim and B.J.
[35:59.750 --> 36:01.130]  B.J. Novak have their show.
[36:01.550 --> 36:02.870]  Are butt plugs real?
[36:03.470 --> 36:04.350]  That was the pivot.
[36:04.730 --> 36:05.770]  That was the pit.
[36:05.950 --> 36:06.750]  That is how it went.
[36:07.050 --> 36:07.950]  I was stunned.
[36:08.730 --> 36:11.430]  Just immediate into are butt plugs real?
[36:11.790 --> 36:12.850]  Have you heard of a butt plug?
[36:13.370 --> 36:17.030]  The candle was still lit in remembrance.
[36:17.770 --> 36:19.250]  And she my mom doesn't curse.
[36:19.630 --> 36:22.910]  She's like very like not at all, like very conservative.
[36:23.190 --> 36:27.270]  She's a very liberal in her beliefs, but a very conservative social person.
[36:27.430 --> 36:28.970]  Are butt plugs real?
[36:29.590 --> 36:31.230]  Have you heard of a butt plug?
[36:31.230 --> 36:35.550]  And I'm just fucking stunned that this has just happened.
[36:36.270 --> 36:38.930]  So then I'm like, yeah, but butt plugs are.
[36:39.250 --> 36:40.730]  Yeah, they're real. Butt plugs are real.
[36:40.810 --> 36:41.790]  And she's like, OK, yeah.
[36:41.890 --> 36:46.410]  She explained that I guess the plot of the episode of the show involved butt plugs
[36:46.410 --> 36:47.810]  and she had never heard of a butt plug.
[36:47.970 --> 36:51.850]  And she thought that they were a fictional creation for that show.
[36:52.210 --> 36:53.370]  She didn't know that they were real.
[36:54.050 --> 36:56.150]  So then she had to turn to her son for clarification.
[36:56.170 --> 36:59.890]  She had to turn to me on the anniversary of her mom's passing
[37:00.670 --> 37:03.110]  right after we had this very serious talk.
[37:03.450 --> 37:06.190]  So then so then time passes a little bit.
[37:06.410 --> 37:10.410]  And then she says to me, should I Google it or should you just tell me?
[37:11.910 --> 37:13.790]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[37:13.910 --> 37:17.190]  She said, well, like, why do people why would you have a butt plug?
[37:17.650 --> 37:19.450]  Should I Google it or are you going to tell me?
[37:19.710 --> 37:25.170]  Oh, and I said, I can tell you, but you didn't ask like what they did
[37:25.170 --> 37:27.390]  or what they were, but you asked, are they real?
[37:27.470 --> 37:28.690]  And I know they exist.
[37:28.690 --> 37:31.970]  She's clearly wanted to know when she when she asked if they were real.
[37:32.090 --> 37:33.130]  Why didn't you just fill her in on?
[37:34.210 --> 37:38.110]  No, because, listen, it's the context of when it happened and everything.
[37:38.110 --> 37:40.130]  Like, I'm stunned. It's just an insane.
[37:40.370 --> 37:43.630]  This is like I've never had a conversation like this with my mom.
[37:43.730 --> 37:45.330]  And we're going deep on butt plugs.
[37:46.310 --> 37:48.130]  And so then I explained to her, well,
[37:50.770 --> 37:55.470]  I say, like, well, I don't I haven't really looked at butt plugs in depth.
[37:55.470 --> 37:58.490]  But I think from my understanding, some people find
[37:58.490 --> 38:02.590]  pleasure in them, and then there might be like a way to, like,
[38:02.650 --> 38:05.970]  practice or train towards anal sex. I don't really know necessarily.
[38:06.070 --> 38:08.270]  But I believe those are like the leading reasons
[38:08.270 --> 38:12.650]  why you may want a butt plug or wear a butt plug.
[38:13.410 --> 38:16.470]  So then I'm just imagining your wedding one day.
[38:16.510 --> 38:18.870]  And she's like, what about dildos?
[38:21.950 --> 38:26.110]  So then I explain that and there's a pause and like I can see her processing.
[38:26.110 --> 38:30.450]  And then she says, what's more known, a butt plug or a brony?
[38:30.770 --> 38:33.390]  Out of fucking left field, because she had just learned.
[38:33.570 --> 38:36.790]  She just learned that bronies exist like two days prior.
[38:37.890 --> 38:40.750]  And I really struggled to answer that question.
[38:40.870 --> 38:42.010]  Oh, definitely butt plug.
[38:42.250 --> 38:43.430]  But I would assume.
[38:43.670 --> 38:44.390]  Oh, I feel like.
[38:44.690 --> 38:45.150]  Thousands of years.
[38:45.650 --> 38:47.070]  Bronyism was a fad.
[38:47.490 --> 38:48.670]  Yeah. Like a decade ago.
[38:49.030 --> 38:49.510]  Flash in the pan.
[38:49.950 --> 38:53.250]  Really? I was more I didn't know because I feel like it was so big,
[38:53.310 --> 38:55.590]  but maybe it's just because I knew people that were super into it.
[38:55.590 --> 38:59.890]  So my perception of how popular My Little Pony and bronies were.
[39:00.030 --> 39:00.890]  I'll say this.
[39:01.170 --> 39:03.470]  Are you are those people still bronies?
[39:03.610 --> 39:04.890]  Are they still way into it? No.
[39:05.310 --> 39:06.470]  Well, I tell you what.
[39:06.570 --> 39:09.450]  Once a butt plug fan, probably always a butt plug fan.
[39:09.910 --> 39:11.630]  I don't think you age out of those.
[39:13.030 --> 39:14.270]  So we go through that.
[39:14.310 --> 39:17.670]  And then my mom was just like, oh, things are so sexualized nowadays
[39:17.670 --> 39:18.670]  or something like that.
[39:18.690 --> 39:20.950]  And I was like, well, I think butt plugs have probably been around
[39:20.950 --> 39:24.110]  like an insanely long amount of time if I looked into it.
[39:24.150 --> 39:24.970]  So I searched it.
[39:24.970 --> 39:28.310]  And the first butt plug was made in like 1897.
[39:28.890 --> 39:30.310]  They're called anal dilators.
[39:30.770 --> 39:33.870]  And the guy that sold them were like, this will cure everything.
[39:34.330 --> 39:35.250]  You got night blindness.
[39:35.470 --> 39:36.350]  You need higher IQ.
[39:36.650 --> 39:37.870]  Shove one up. You'll be good.
[39:37.950 --> 39:39.270]  You got this. You're going to be fine.
[39:39.370 --> 39:43.570]  And he did that unchecked for like 30 years until like the FDA
[39:43.570 --> 39:47.410]  looked at how he was marketing them and was like, you cannot do this.
[39:47.770 --> 39:48.850]  This is illegal.
[39:49.310 --> 39:50.730]  You have to stop selling these.
[39:50.930 --> 39:54.270]  Yeah, but people have been surely shoving shit up their ass for centuries.
[39:54.270 --> 39:56.170]  Can you imagine the conversation?
[39:56.330 --> 39:57.890]  You're like, how did you meet somebody?
[39:57.970 --> 39:58.430]  And you're like, how'd you?
[39:58.570 --> 39:59.470]  So you're well off.
[39:59.530 --> 40:00.570]  How'd your family get your fortune?
[40:00.810 --> 40:04.030]  I really don't want to tell you what it had to do with my great grandfather.
[40:04.930 --> 40:06.130]  That's to do with night blindness.
[40:07.450 --> 40:08.930]  He was a doctor of sorts.
[40:09.630 --> 40:11.270]  So this is there's another plug.
[40:11.350 --> 40:13.130]  I'm just like, I'm stunned.
[40:13.390 --> 40:18.750]  I'm lost that like we are we are like knee deep and ass plug talk on this anniversary.
[40:19.050 --> 40:21.530]  You keep your your your euphemisms, man.
[40:21.530 --> 40:25.690]  We need deep and ass talk stuff.
[40:26.870 --> 40:27.750]  God damn.
[40:28.370 --> 40:32.510]  She like there's another part that she looks at me and she says, wow,
[40:32.810 --> 40:35.550]  at least have something to talk about my friend at lunch tomorrow.
[40:35.690 --> 40:37.170]  I wonder if they've heard about plugs.
[40:37.370 --> 40:41.890]  And it's like she's going out for like a coffee with like her other 60 year old friend.
[40:42.490 --> 40:46.670]  Do you think she's one of the oldest people to discover the butt plug alive today?
[40:46.890 --> 40:50.830]  Yeah. Oh, she like breaking news to all of her friends.
[40:50.830 --> 40:52.870]  And they're like, what now?
[40:53.450 --> 40:56.310]  I don't have that would be a great thing to discover.
[40:56.910 --> 40:58.690]  Has to request some information.
[40:59.130 --> 41:00.150]  Absolutely. At a future date.
[41:00.270 --> 41:04.330]  Can you check back in with your mom and find out if her friends knew what butt plugs?
[41:04.650 --> 41:06.930]  Oh, no. She's like the last one to the table.
[41:07.470 --> 41:09.190]  Just hey, let me finish.
[41:09.350 --> 41:10.490]  OK, I'm going to get there.
[41:11.210 --> 41:12.190]  I didn't realize.
[41:12.550 --> 41:13.310]  What a song.
[41:13.470 --> 41:13.810]  We're still going.
[41:13.970 --> 41:15.870]  Are we close to reaching the climax?
[41:16.410 --> 41:17.050]  We're getting there.
[41:17.450 --> 41:20.310]  So she pulls out her phone after this,
[41:20.310 --> 41:25.010]  after like I explain because I like showed her what the original butt plugs look like.
[41:26.350 --> 41:29.650]  And then so she pulls out her phone to like clearly search them.
[41:30.090 --> 41:32.970]  And she whispers like she's even like embarrassed to say it out loud.
[41:33.030 --> 41:36.430]  She's like, is is butt plugs spelled with one T or two?
[41:37.150 --> 41:40.350]  She didn't know it was butt plug or literal butt plug.
[41:43.190 --> 41:45.030]  So I had to clarify that.
[41:45.830 --> 41:47.570]  And then I was just like, don't fucking know.
[41:47.630 --> 41:48.990]  Don't search. I'll pull it up.
[41:48.990 --> 41:53.190]  Like it's going to be a fucking disaster if you search for this.
[41:54.030 --> 41:57.030]  So I pull it up and I show a photo of it.
[41:57.350 --> 41:59.950]  And she looked at it and she's immediately like $15.
[42:00.430 --> 42:01.430]  Those are low quality.
[42:01.590 --> 42:02.330]  It's a three pack.
[42:02.490 --> 42:03.830]  Like what? This is a bullshit.
[42:04.190 --> 42:09.170]  But she's immediately critiquing the quality of it and deem them to be like shitty
[42:09.170 --> 42:10.430]  and that there better be.
[42:10.490 --> 42:12.570]  She was like, are there titanium ones?
[42:12.690 --> 42:14.750]  Like what are the high end for butt plugs?
[42:15.870 --> 42:17.090]  And it's like a chromium butt plug.
[42:17.090 --> 42:19.290]  Your mom, your mom thought those were shitty butt plugs.
[42:19.470 --> 42:23.010]  She thought they were pieces of shit that were cheap and she likes fancy,
[42:23.470 --> 42:24.170]  extravagant things.
[42:24.290 --> 42:25.890]  So she's like, what's the high end of this?
[42:26.030 --> 42:27.090]  Or do they come in titanium?
[42:27.510 --> 42:30.670]  So now I'm on like just a sex, like a random sex store site
[42:30.670 --> 42:32.090]  pulling up butt plugs.
[42:32.270 --> 42:34.930]  I find the most expensive one is like one hundred sixty dollars.
[42:35.110 --> 42:37.050]  Was it like a Chanel collaboration or something?
[42:38.230 --> 42:41.230]  Gucci is a Gucci, but Chanel X anal.
[42:41.230 --> 42:49.490]  Yeah, it was remote operated and she just she wasn't impressed
[42:49.490 --> 42:50.470]  because it was a titanium.
[42:50.690 --> 42:51.770]  She's like, get the fuck out of here.
[42:51.770 --> 42:52.890]  I don't care. It's not titanium.
[42:53.130 --> 42:57.050]  So then I showed her one that made it look like you had a tail and she was done.
[42:57.310 --> 42:58.370]  That was it. We were done.
[42:58.490 --> 43:00.110]  She had no that killed it much.
[43:00.190 --> 43:01.650]  That was a bridge too far.
[43:01.930 --> 43:03.590]  You're not allowed to have a tail.
[43:03.830 --> 43:06.170]  So that was the limits of your mom.
[43:06.290 --> 43:08.810]  Yeah. Yeah. We've we hit the peak of it.
[43:08.810 --> 43:12.390]  So I talked to her today and I asked,
[43:13.150 --> 43:16.290]  I asked jokingly because she had had
[43:16.290 --> 43:19.990]  she's been to like four different lunches or whatever since we've had this talk.
[43:20.990 --> 43:24.490]  So I asked her, I asked, like, just as I said, as a joke.
[43:24.750 --> 43:27.470]  So did you talk to your friends if they knew what butt plugs were?
[43:27.950 --> 43:30.390]  And she said, like, completely seriously.
[43:30.850 --> 43:32.410]  Yes, I'm doing a survey.
[43:32.730 --> 43:34.130]  And then she went through a list.
[43:34.190 --> 43:37.130]  She is asked every time she is like interacting with a friend
[43:37.130 --> 43:38.650]  that she hasn't interact with about the subject.
[43:38.870 --> 43:42.370]  She is bringing up the subject of butt plugs versus bronies.
[43:42.790 --> 43:46.450]  Specifically, she is surveying how many of her friends
[43:46.450 --> 43:49.870]  in the six year old demographic know either or of these things.
[43:49.950 --> 43:51.410]  So she's asked two people so far.
[43:52.110 --> 43:55.090]  Both of them knew what butt plugs were, didn't know what bronies were.
[43:55.630 --> 43:56.770]  I don't think you're adopted.
[43:57.630 --> 44:02.850]  So the I love that your mom thinks you're an anal expert.
[44:03.610 --> 44:05.890]  I just I think she was shocked that I knew.
[44:05.890 --> 44:07.830]  I think she was expecting me to say no.
[44:08.430 --> 44:12.030]  She really thought they were a fictional thing created for.
[44:12.350 --> 44:15.950]  She she was like, allow me to spill the tea on butt plugs.
[44:16.790 --> 44:18.410]  So is this like an annual thing?
[44:18.530 --> 44:21.710]  Like every year when the candle gets lit, do you think it'll be a different topic
[44:21.710 --> 44:22.290]  of conversation?
[44:22.750 --> 44:26.270]  I don't. I'm terrified of what it could possibly be next year.
[44:26.430 --> 44:30.430]  But it was just the the absurdity of the conversation
[44:30.430 --> 44:34.410]  that it kept going further in the questions and the subject.
[44:34.570 --> 44:35.530]  It was just it was wild.
[44:36.130 --> 44:38.190]  Yeah, I was stunned. I'm still stunned.
[44:38.310 --> 44:41.790]  I'm still processing it, but I'll keep you guys updated as this survey
[44:41.790 --> 44:42.950]  gets filled up further.
[44:43.310 --> 44:45.510]  So far, zero bronies.
[44:45.630 --> 44:46.410]  What's the demographic?
[44:46.710 --> 44:48.110]  Just middle aged Canadian women?
[44:48.370 --> 44:50.670]  60 year old Canadian women. Yeah. OK.
[44:52.090 --> 44:53.630]  Oh, my God, dude.
[44:53.690 --> 44:55.530]  Well, I'll say this, Gavin.
[44:56.010 --> 44:59.250]  I know what we're getting to Andrew for Christmas and for his birthday
[44:59.250 --> 45:02.310]  and for Christmas and his birthday until he dies.
[45:05.530 --> 45:08.030]  How what temperature does titanium melt at?
[45:09.350 --> 45:11.930]  Oh, I have no idea.
[45:12.690 --> 45:13.830]  Why are you even asking?
[45:13.990 --> 45:15.370]  I'll try and whip something up.
[45:19.910 --> 45:21.150]  Titanium melting temp.
[45:21.510 --> 45:24.330]  You know, do you want it in Fahrenheit or Celsius?
[45:25.070 --> 45:25.810]  Celsius, please.
[45:26.150 --> 45:27.570]  Sixteen hundred and sixty eight.
[45:27.890 --> 45:29.010]  Oh, that's doable.
[45:29.370 --> 45:31.130]  A little foundry, a little bit of a propane.
[45:32.050 --> 45:36.190]  For for for normal humans, that's three thousand thirty four Fahrenheit.
[45:37.070 --> 45:38.870]  Normal. What? What?
[45:39.270 --> 45:41.190]  Why? I don't I don't understand what that was.
[45:41.670 --> 45:42.770]  What? What just happened?
[45:43.070 --> 45:43.770]  Temperature talk.
[45:44.110 --> 45:44.990]  We argue about temperatures.
[45:46.190 --> 45:48.910]  Somehow, you guys are more baffled going back and forth with that
[45:48.910 --> 45:51.950]  than me hearing my fucking mom talk about butt plugs out of nowhere.
[45:52.750 --> 45:55.470]  No, I just Americans always think that it's like, oh, you've got to be
[45:55.470 --> 45:57.470]  you've got to convert it for Europeans or something.
[45:57.610 --> 45:59.650]  It's like the entire world used is Celsius.
[45:59.650 --> 46:02.330]  I was just insulting Gavin because he's not understood.
[46:02.870 --> 46:04.970]  Yeah. Even though he's desperate to be.
[46:05.530 --> 46:05.990]  Yeah. Do you?
[46:06.670 --> 46:07.750]  Where do you live?
[46:08.910 --> 46:09.890]  Yeah, good point.
[46:10.370 --> 46:12.290]  Not not only do you live in America, dickhead,
[46:12.510 --> 46:14.770]  you live in the most American state in America.
[46:14.930 --> 46:16.170]  You live in fucking Texas.
[46:16.650 --> 46:17.510]  Dude, America's great.
[46:17.590 --> 46:19.150]  I came home to a cucumber today.
[46:21.490 --> 46:22.630]  Is that so is that edible?
[46:22.730 --> 46:23.490]  How edible is that?
[46:23.550 --> 46:24.410]  Is that a joke? Cucumber?
[46:24.530 --> 46:25.790]  Oh, my God, I gave it.
[46:25.850 --> 46:27.370]  I gave it to Millie yesterday in her lunch.
[46:27.830 --> 46:29.730]  OK, let's tell you.
[46:30.430 --> 46:31.550]  You gave her a whole cucumber.
[46:31.870 --> 46:34.210]  No, I gave her the third that I cut off, idiot.
[46:35.210 --> 46:38.550]  The part that's peeled off and chopped off.
[46:39.870 --> 46:41.470]  You say that you gave the whole thing to her.
[46:41.530 --> 46:42.390]  This is what she left.
[46:42.770 --> 46:43.510]  No, no.
[46:43.610 --> 46:46.470]  It's like I said, dole out a little bit every day.
[46:46.870 --> 46:48.090]  Oh, gave her tomatoes.
[46:48.330 --> 46:49.750]  You have I gave you the cucumber.
[46:50.850 --> 46:53.050]  Do you have anything you want to specifically bring up, Gavin,
[46:53.070 --> 46:54.770]  or should I go and jingle, jingle, jingle?
[46:54.890 --> 46:56.210]  Finally, you get to jingle, jingle, jingle.
[46:56.210 --> 46:59.710]  When I was trying to find that Randy Savage clip, I also found this.
[46:59.850 --> 47:02.810]  This isn't related to f***face, but this is what we were talking about
[47:03.310 --> 47:07.010]  last time when Andrew was confused about the full English breakfast.
[47:07.550 --> 47:08.310]  Oh, yeah.
[47:09.190 --> 47:12.790]  To be fair, I feel like the way you described it was very confusing.
[47:13.070 --> 47:14.170]  You said, what's the black thing?
[47:14.190 --> 47:16.010]  I says black pudding. It's like fried blood.
[47:17.990 --> 47:19.050]  Yeah, just fried.
[47:19.130 --> 47:21.310]  I didn't have any concept of what fried blood was.
[47:21.710 --> 47:22.210]  Blood sausage.
[47:22.570 --> 47:23.230]  Do you like it?
[47:23.310 --> 47:25.290]  Do I like it? No, no, I hate it.
[47:25.290 --> 47:27.250]  Is it popular? Do most people like it?
[47:27.750 --> 47:30.070]  I mean, if you order full English, it's a part of it.
[47:30.350 --> 47:32.910]  Usually, I've ordered a lot of full English and I've never gotten it.
[47:33.270 --> 47:34.230]  Really? Yeah.
[47:34.490 --> 47:36.290]  I mean, it's probably the first thing to go.
[47:36.430 --> 47:38.750]  It's the first sort of polarizing item.
[47:39.090 --> 47:41.270]  Yeah, they probably don't even bother, like in the tourist areas.
[47:41.690 --> 47:42.990]  It's probably hard to get here.
[47:43.430 --> 47:45.510]  Well, I mean, blood sausage, you get that in the stores, don't you?
[47:45.830 --> 47:46.750]  It's pretty much what it is.
[47:47.090 --> 47:48.990]  Mmm, no. That's what the confusion was.
[47:48.990 --> 47:52.230]  I didn't know the prep of making in my head.
[47:52.570 --> 47:54.210]  I didn't know what the process was.
[47:54.210 --> 47:56.230]  Like in the same way Canada's bagged milk.
[47:56.350 --> 47:57.590]  You're like, yeah, get a bag of blood.
[47:57.970 --> 47:59.970]  Go grab some blood, get some cow blood, throw it in a pan.
[47:59.990 --> 48:01.110]  You were saying I was misrepresenting it.
[48:01.130 --> 48:02.510]  I was like, yes, it's like fried blood.
[48:02.590 --> 48:03.850]  You were like, you've misled me.
[48:03.910 --> 48:06.170]  It's fried blood and fat.
[48:06.370 --> 48:07.790]  Well, I wasn't aware of what a blood...
[48:07.790 --> 48:10.250]  I asked what a... I don't know what a blood sausage is.
[48:10.310 --> 48:12.250]  So I asked, is it part of the blood sausage?
[48:12.790 --> 48:14.410]  Is that what a blood sausage is?
[48:14.630 --> 48:16.450]  Is it the blood from the blood sausage?
[48:16.790 --> 48:20.590]  And we just moved on, moved on, just completely stepped over that.
[48:21.270 --> 48:22.990]  Eric wants us to talk about Jingle, Jingle, Jingle.
[48:22.990 --> 48:23.810]  Should we talk about?
[48:24.030 --> 48:24.810]  Yeah. Hold on a second.
[48:24.970 --> 48:28.790]  Would you eat blood, black pudding or whatever the fuck it's called, Andrew?
[48:29.370 --> 48:30.150]  Oh, absolutely not.
[48:30.310 --> 48:33.390]  I mean, we it took a step further where I would be willing to try different
[48:33.390 --> 48:33.970]  types of blood.
[48:34.270 --> 48:36.990]  He thinks every animal's blood would taste the same.
[48:37.470 --> 48:38.470]  I was curious if it would.
[48:38.630 --> 48:39.170]  There's no way.
[48:39.230 --> 48:42.090]  If every meat tastes different, then surely the blood would be a different flavor.
[48:42.570 --> 48:45.290]  I don't think it would be that wide of a range of things.
[48:45.750 --> 48:46.130]  I...
[48:46.670 --> 48:49.450]  Because black pudding can be usually pork or beef, I think.
[48:49.810 --> 48:50.030]  I bet.
[48:50.090 --> 48:52.410]  I don't think if you were, if you let's say
[48:52.410 --> 48:54.250]  this is a ridiculous conversation.
[48:54.470 --> 48:57.590]  If you got super into drinking cow's blood, just as a side,
[48:57.690 --> 48:59.190]  it was your beverage of choice for a while.
[48:59.450 --> 49:02.350]  If we laid out a bunch of different bloods on a table,
[49:02.610 --> 49:05.050]  I don't think you'd be able to distinguish which one is cow.
[49:05.430 --> 49:06.970]  Should we do a blind bloodshot test?
[49:07.610 --> 49:08.770]  I think you guys should.
[49:08.890 --> 49:09.730]  I think it's gross as fuck.
[49:09.870 --> 49:12.470]  I also think, Andrew, you've got the perfect thing to bring up with your mom
[49:12.470 --> 49:14.430]  next year when you have your album.
[49:18.290 --> 49:19.750]  Oh, oh, OK.
[49:19.850 --> 49:21.910]  So Jingle, Jingle, Jingle, Jingle.
[49:21.910 --> 49:24.870]  Was it's a uniform, it's sort of a uniform.
[49:25.510 --> 49:27.290]  It's a uniform creation, Geoff.
[49:27.450 --> 49:30.170]  In some ways, it was a discussion of
[49:30.850 --> 49:35.270]  the wrist pocket, which will, I think, either have gone on sale
[49:35.270 --> 49:37.470]  or will be coming on sale soon.
[49:37.850 --> 49:39.690]  Hopefully it's already on sale, but yeah, we'll see.
[49:40.070 --> 49:43.850]  Yeah, I haven't actually done the shitty part yet, but it's due tomorrow.
[49:44.010 --> 49:45.450]  So I think I'll be doing it most of tonight.
[49:46.310 --> 49:51.070]  And so we're talking about, I don't I don't remember how it was like
[49:52.130 --> 49:54.750]  scenarios in which you would use a beef bracelet.
[49:54.910 --> 49:56.830]  Is that it? Is that the conversation of it?
[49:56.910 --> 50:01.050]  We're talking about clothing items in the way that in a scenario
[50:01.050 --> 50:05.570]  in which you're in an orgy, the beef bracelet would be the field choice,
[50:05.570 --> 50:09.430]  I think, of anything else like you would need to be wearable.
[50:09.890 --> 50:11.450]  You can maintain energy, get a snack.
[50:11.510 --> 50:12.770]  You don't need to leave the pile.
[50:13.210 --> 50:14.750]  It would be the number one.
[50:15.370 --> 50:16.830]  It would be the number one thing.
[50:17.050 --> 50:17.990]  You just stick around.
[50:18.190 --> 50:20.310]  You don't have to leave at that point with the beef bracelet.
[50:20.310 --> 50:21.850]  As long as you're not into fisting.
[50:22.170 --> 50:23.730]  That's a quick way to lose a beef bracelet.
[50:23.850 --> 50:25.970]  That's true. You got to be on your non-dominant hand.
[50:27.410 --> 50:27.650]  Yeah.
[50:28.910 --> 50:31.850]  Like the episode of Mr. Bean where he loses his watch in the turkey.
[50:36.780 --> 50:40.620]  And so we're talking about like how every other item is inferior
[50:40.620 --> 50:43.420]  to the beef bracelet in the orgy scenario.
[50:43.920 --> 50:48.200]  And that imagine some guy in the orgy with a fucking fanny pack on
[50:48.200 --> 50:51.740]  with a bunch of keys in it, just jingling all over the place.
[50:51.740 --> 50:52.780]  It's jingle, jingle, jingle.
[50:53.120 --> 50:54.320]  It's jingling all over.
[50:54.800 --> 50:57.840]  So that is that was the origin of the fanny pack.
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.360]  The worst thing to wear in an orgy.
[50:59.660 --> 51:00.820]  Yeah. Yes, it was.
[51:00.840 --> 51:04.100]  It was by far, because it's just imagining like a janitor in a movie
[51:04.100 --> 51:05.420]  with like that many keys.
[51:05.440 --> 51:09.080]  But that guy in an orgy with a fanny pack, just the jingle. Exactly.
[51:10.820 --> 51:12.380]  Just like that and grunting.
[51:13.280 --> 51:13.680]  Yeah.
[51:14.480 --> 51:18.340]  So when we were talking about uniform and the value of the beef bracelet,
[51:18.400 --> 51:21.420]  I think we really missed the orgy market in that demographic.
[51:21.420 --> 51:23.800]  I think we really could have angled better to them.
[51:24.660 --> 51:27.080]  I think that would be I'm trying to think there are other products, right?
[51:27.120 --> 51:30.340]  Where like they made it and then it got adopted in a way that they didn't at all
[51:30.340 --> 51:33.840]  intend. Yeah, that's always, of course, absolutely happens all the time.
[51:33.920 --> 51:36.660]  I think that's maybe where the beef bracelet would go.
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.420]  I think it would maybe I mean, a huge hit like Wrigley's Gum
[51:40.420 --> 51:43.280]  started out as a soap company and really make gum.
[51:43.480 --> 51:45.540]  Yeah, they would include like it was like during the Great Depression
[51:45.540 --> 51:46.240]  or around that time.
[51:46.280 --> 51:48.680]  And so they had to like they were coming up with like incentives
[51:49.920 --> 51:54.080]  like we would give away a free air freshener with a shirt maybe in the store.
[51:54.580 --> 51:57.640]  But they would give away like a free piece of gum when you would buy soap
[51:57.640 --> 51:58.980]  to convince people to buy it.
[51:59.020 --> 52:00.780]  And then the soap, the gum became so popular.
[52:00.920 --> 52:03.420]  They just said, fuck the soap and went all in on gum.
[52:04.380 --> 52:04.700]  Wow.
[52:05.640 --> 52:08.380]  Just to clarify what Nick said, did you say leave the pile?
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.220]  I absolutely did. Yeah, of course.
[52:10.300 --> 52:11.420]  I assume it's just a pile.
[52:11.700 --> 52:12.940]  I've never been in an orgy.
[52:13.040 --> 52:16.460]  I haven't I haven't even seen Eyes Wide Shut, which I feel like would probably be.
[52:16.460 --> 52:18.720]  Didn't you get invited to an orgy once, though?
[52:19.080 --> 52:20.920]  Did I did? Yeah, the homeless orgy.
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.280]  Yeah, we can't we cover that.
[52:22.500 --> 52:23.740]  Yeah, we have covered that.
[52:23.980 --> 52:27.200]  I've received an invite to a homeless orgy, but I've never I didn't attend.
[52:27.520 --> 52:31.140]  That would probably be the jingliest orgy because homeless people
[52:31.140 --> 52:34.760]  typically have more loose change and also just like nuts and bolts and shit.
[52:34.780 --> 52:36.280]  Probably just random stuff.
[52:36.600 --> 52:38.680]  What is whatever you find off the ground?
[52:39.800 --> 52:41.340]  The jingliest orgy.
[52:42.040 --> 52:44.560]  Yeah, I mean, you figure like homeless people are probably
[52:44.560 --> 52:46.340]  they have to be resourceful.
[52:46.660 --> 52:49.100]  So if you see something that could be useful down the road, you want to pick it up.
[52:51.140 --> 52:52.820]  Well, nuts and bolts, though.
[52:53.340 --> 52:55.000]  I don't know. I was just thinking of shit to clanks, man.
[52:55.840 --> 52:59.340]  You can build a shanty with nuts and bolts if you have enough spare ones around.
[53:02.180 --> 53:04.380]  Sure. Yeah, that's what the newest Banjo-Kazooie was about.
[53:04.460 --> 53:06.880]  It is nuts and bolts, Banjo-Kazooie nuts and bolts.
[53:08.300 --> 53:11.320]  Oh, I'm going to be playing Donkey Kong this weekend.
[53:12.300 --> 53:13.020]  That's a thing.
[53:13.120 --> 53:15.660]  That's already long over by the time this comes out.
[53:15.840 --> 53:18.860]  For whoever hears this, but yeah, just in the context of when we're doing this.
[53:18.920 --> 53:19.340]  Are you excited?
[53:21.560 --> 53:22.420]  No, not at all.
[53:22.420 --> 53:23.900]  Starting with what's your game plan?
[53:25.640 --> 53:26.780]  I have 44 hours, right?
[53:27.140 --> 53:27.840]  Yeah. Is that it?
[53:27.920 --> 53:29.240]  OK, great. Yeah, this. OK.
[53:29.620 --> 53:32.940]  Well, you have you have the you reserve the right to add another four hours.
[53:32.940 --> 53:34.840]  Yeah, I'm not going to. I'm going to. I'm fine.
[53:35.060 --> 53:37.080]  I'm not going to need it. I'm good. I'm excited.
[53:38.280 --> 53:40.400]  Do you have all your snacks and everything ready?
[53:40.400 --> 53:41.660]  No, I'm going to do that tomorrow.
[53:41.820 --> 53:42.760]  I got to prepare tomorrow.
[53:42.920 --> 53:43.600]  I can take it seriously.
[53:43.700 --> 53:46.860]  Got to get my blood sausage and my my fried blood.
[53:47.360 --> 53:49.240]  Now, what else?
[53:49.640 --> 53:52.660]  What happened last time you knocked it off the table or something?
[53:52.980 --> 53:55.380]  What do you mean? What happened? Oh, what? Why did it not say?
[53:55.700 --> 53:59.160]  I realized that the save function didn't work for how I was playing it.
[53:59.200 --> 54:02.260]  So I had to turn my computer off until then I did.
[54:02.320 --> 54:03.420]  And I lost all my progress.
[54:03.680 --> 54:04.820]  What do you mean for how you were playing it?
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.360]  I was playing it on on a computer.
[54:06.780 --> 54:10.080]  Oh, I wasn't like playing it through an N64 because using an emulator.
[54:10.080 --> 54:10.820]  What are you doing this time?
[54:11.420 --> 54:13.640]  I'm going to use an I'm going to use the exact same emulator.
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.340]  And I'm just not going to I'm not going to turn my computer off until I beat it.
[54:17.460 --> 54:19.540]  Well, man, what if the power goes out?
[54:20.160 --> 54:23.280]  If the if the power goes out, that would be a problem.
[54:23.660 --> 54:24.500]  That would be unfortunate.
[54:25.380 --> 54:26.740]  Yeah, I would lose.
[54:27.120 --> 54:28.480]  He's going to wiggle out of this.
[54:28.720 --> 54:29.600]  Yeah. How am I going to wiggle out?
[54:29.680 --> 54:31.580]  No, he's going to wiggle out of this.
[54:31.640 --> 54:34.520]  Listen to this. Listen to how he's already setting this up.
[54:34.700 --> 54:37.240]  No, I can't be the only one who sees this coming.
[54:37.240 --> 54:39.580]  There is no I don't.
[54:39.700 --> 54:42.840]  It doesn't. Whatever happens if I don't beat it,
[54:42.920 --> 54:45.320]  if I don't get the end credits within the time limit, I lose.
[54:45.680 --> 54:46.300]  Doesn't matter.
[54:46.780 --> 54:50.820]  So if your computer, so your power goes out, your computer turns off.
[54:50.900 --> 54:52.220]  Doesn't even have to be your power going out.
[54:52.280 --> 54:54.800]  Something. Sure. Some Windows update, whatever it is.
[54:54.800 --> 54:57.280]  Yeah. Your computer restarts, you lose all your progress.
[54:58.540 --> 54:59.660]  You're fine with that.
[54:59.960 --> 55:01.420]  No, I will accept the loss.
[55:01.560 --> 55:02.320]  One hundred percent.
[55:02.560 --> 55:03.180]  I won't complain.
[55:03.400 --> 55:04.180]  Just get an N64.
[55:04.840 --> 55:05.340]  You got time.
[55:05.760 --> 55:07.720]  Well, I don't know how it seems like a lot of fucking.
[55:07.980 --> 55:08.700]  What do you mean, I have time?
[55:08.940 --> 55:10.120]  I mean, I already have one.
[55:10.180 --> 55:11.300]  I don't have the game.
[55:11.500 --> 55:12.600]  Would be the game.
[55:13.320 --> 55:14.560]  Well, yeah. Tomorrow.
[55:15.820 --> 55:16.520]  What am I going to get?
[55:16.520 --> 55:19.040]  There's not a used game store in Vancouver you could go to?
[55:20.080 --> 55:24.140]  There's like two in my town, and I don't know if they would have that version.
[55:24.300 --> 55:25.320]  You need the expansion pack too.
[55:25.620 --> 55:28.500]  Also, then how would I stream off of my N64?
[55:30.460 --> 55:32.040]  HDMI adapter. Hmm.
[55:32.480 --> 55:35.400]  So now send me a fucking list of things I now need to get.
[55:35.660 --> 55:37.120]  And well, we could have got you all this stuff.
[55:37.280 --> 55:40.320]  You mentioned it three weeks ago when you decided to do this.
[55:40.580 --> 55:42.380]  We could have had it all planned out for you.
[55:42.820 --> 55:43.360]  That's fair.
[55:43.800 --> 55:45.340]  I'm not going to argue that point. That's fair.
[55:45.560 --> 55:46.520]  Oh, I think it'll be fine.
[55:46.680 --> 55:48.240]  Oh, I can you please argue the point?
[55:48.540 --> 55:49.440]  I have to know.
[55:49.860 --> 55:51.700]  Oh, I mean, what would I mean?
[55:51.740 --> 55:52.660]  I guess I don't know.
[55:53.300 --> 55:56.540]  Why is it assumed who streams off of an N64?
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.540]  I don't feel like that's all that common.
[55:59.140 --> 56:01.740]  I think most people streaming N64 games.
[56:01.740 --> 56:05.340]  Your argument for not telling a streamer is that who streams.
[56:05.640 --> 56:06.360]  Eric, be quiet.
[56:06.380 --> 56:09.500]  You told me to fucking argue a point I didn't want to argue.
[56:09.800 --> 56:12.300]  And then I argued the point because you asked me to.
[56:12.640 --> 56:14.180]  And then you tell me it's not a good argument.
[56:15.420 --> 56:17.160]  I said I wasn't going to argue it.
[56:17.540 --> 56:19.980]  I never came from a position of this is a great argument.
[56:20.520 --> 56:22.260]  It's a ridiculous thing you just did.
[56:23.180 --> 56:24.060]  It's madness.
[56:24.460 --> 56:25.080]  It's going quiet.
[56:26.400 --> 56:27.520]  It's not a good argument.
[56:29.500 --> 56:30.560]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[56:33.300 --> 56:34.060]  You OK?
[56:34.520 --> 56:35.520]  You're not laughing?
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.420]  I'm trying not to laugh.
[56:38.920 --> 56:41.160]  You got me so bad with your mom, though.
[56:41.760 --> 56:46.220]  You have no idea how much pain you caused me.
[56:46.720 --> 56:47.820]  It was brutal.
[56:48.220 --> 56:52.240]  Oh, I just love the idea of the tail and the butt plug coming up and her just
[56:52.240 --> 56:54.300]  snuffing the candle out and walking away.
[56:54.600 --> 56:57.620]  There is no God who blows the candle out.
[56:58.020 --> 56:59.160]  That's a bridge too far.
[56:59.840 --> 57:02.500]  I thought I was losing my mind yesterday.
[57:02.820 --> 57:09.440]  I got some new headphones, like AirPods sort of things, and they're paired to my phone.
[57:09.540 --> 57:12.260]  And I also paired them to my iMac where I edit stuff.
[57:12.800 --> 57:19.080]  And I was listening to the I was proofing the next episode of F*** Face that Nick or Dennis sent.
[57:19.860 --> 57:27.580]  And if I pause something with the headphones and then resume it within a short amount of time, it just continues what I was doing.
[57:27.580 --> 57:36.140]  But I guess if I've used my phone too much in between or enough time has passed for some reason, it just decides I've given up on this connection to the phone.
[57:36.220 --> 57:39.580]  I'm now on the Mac and what it was doing.
[57:39.700 --> 57:41.040]  And this is where I thought I was losing my mind.
[57:41.580 --> 57:49.180]  On my Mac, if you open like the music app, I guess what iTunes became, I never used the app.
[57:49.220 --> 57:55.620]  But what I had on there was a ringtone I just made, which is like a little clip from my pinball machine.
[57:55.620 --> 57:57.140]  I just turned it into my ringtone.
[57:57.260 --> 58:00.240]  But to do that, I had to like put it through that music app and all that stuff.
[58:00.380 --> 58:07.360]  And then the next file down was some lines I had Dan record for some slow-mo video where I was having him pretend to be a robot.
[58:07.920 --> 58:17.280]  And I guess when I tried to resume my phone playback of F*** Face, it decided, hey, I'm controlling the iMac now.
[58:17.300 --> 58:19.620]  And it started playing my ringtone.
[58:19.860 --> 58:23.080]  So I was like, oh, I get a call.
[58:23.080 --> 58:27.780]  So I double tap the side of the AirPods to answer the call.
[58:27.900 --> 58:31.280]  But when no one's actually calling you, it just skips track.
[58:31.580 --> 58:36.120]  So it skipped to the next track, which was Dan going, hey B.
[58:36.340 --> 58:39.240]  And I was like, hey B.
[58:39.680 --> 58:46.800]  And because he was doing multiple takes, he just kept saying it in different intonations.
[58:47.280 --> 58:48.760]  So he was like, hey B.
[58:48.860 --> 58:50.580]  And I was like, uh, hey B.
[58:50.780 --> 58:52.360]  And he was like, hey B.
[58:52.360 --> 58:54.780]  And I was like, hey B.
[58:56.540 --> 59:03.820]  And I'm just there in my freaking kitchen, talking to audiophiles that are playing on my Mac in a different room.
[59:04.020 --> 59:09.500]  It took me, it took me about 45 seconds to realize I wasn't actually on the phone with Dan.
[59:09.700 --> 59:13.200]  It was like such a weird series of events.
[59:13.280 --> 59:16.460]  And I was like, oh my God, I'm like 60 years old.
[59:16.620 --> 59:19.580]  Again, this technology is running circles around me.
[59:19.720 --> 59:21.340]  I just was so confused.
[59:22.360 --> 59:24.120]  I hate you so much.
[59:26.580 --> 59:28.920]  And it's not like I had the app open.
[59:29.140 --> 59:30.100]  I tested it out.
[59:30.560 --> 59:33.580]  It just opens the music app on my Mac.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.420]  And there's only like a bunch of things.
[59:35.680 --> 59:38.040]  I just couldn't believe that that's what was actually happening.
[59:42.180 --> 59:42.740]  Perfect.
[59:43.100 --> 59:52.100]  Oh, I wish I could post my security footage of me just staring at my kitchen cabinets.
[59:54.080 --> 59:57.400]  Can you post the audio maybe of his different takes?
[59:57.680 --> 59:58.940]  And like, that'd be great.
[59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.340]  I'd love to hear the one side.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.400]  That was after all that was done.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.380]  It was like 20 minutes of trying to figure out where the audio was actually coming from.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.820]  Because I didn't know that they were stored in the music app.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.760]  I was so confused.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.900]  I gotta give up on technology.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.460]  That is the most amazing...
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:16.380]  Yeah, fuck technology.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:16.940]  I agree with you.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.220]  I've done it, dude.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.160]  Oh, fucking...
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.780]  I am having a problem with my CarPlay.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.780]  It's so...
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.560]  But that's maybe the funniest story I've heard in a year.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.760]  That's fantastic.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:29.800]  What?
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.320]  I'm just trying not to laugh anymore, man.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.500]  My fucking mouth is on fire.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.040]  So yeah, the weird sort of me just trying to live on my own at home sort of work.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:41.720]  Not live alone.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.800]  I love the...
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.940]  Me trying to mind my own business.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.940]  Just trying to like be a person who owns a house.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.220]  How do you make that happen?
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.300]  It jumps to your ringtone and then to your friend saying hello to you in a way that...
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:01:03.460]  Yeah, because who would have as the last two files that just got added to iTunes, their own ringtone followed by their friend saying hello.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.820]  Like no one has those two files.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.200]  Oh, God.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:08.660]  That's amazing.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.660]  Maybe I'll make a little video sequence to like replicate it.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.640]  Because I could replicate it every time.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.420]  Like a dramatic reenactment.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.540]  Oh, that would be amazing.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.520]  Like a black and white dramatic reenactment.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.300]  Like it's on forensic files.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:22.940]  I love it.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.200]  That was good.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.020]  I'm gonna miss you guys.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.120]  Yeah, that's a pretty good episode.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]  Well, hey, I have a question.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.200]  Is that it?
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.200]  Are we done recording for a while?
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.860]  Or are you out of town now?
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080]  So I'm gone for three weeks, then I'm back.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.580]  But we've got enough episodes to hold us over.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:40.560]  That's all.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.020]  I did not.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:41.660]  I didn't.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.360]  I'll be honest.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.620]  I didn't anticipate.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.660]  God damn it.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.720]  It's Dan.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.060]  I didn't even think we were recording this week.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.100]  So this is really pleasant.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.440]  No, my flight got moved.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.080]  I should be in England right now.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480]  Yeah, well, thank God it got moved.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.660]  And also condolences.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:11.420]  But yeah, this was a, as Gavin would say, an absolute corker.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.200]  Whatever the fuck that means.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.100]  I've never heard Gavin say that.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.120]  That's what Andrew's mom was talking about the other night.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.260]  No, no.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:36.620]  Hey, if you're a regulation listener or even a comment leaver, or maybe you're just on the fence and considering being one or the other, you're not quite sure where you fit in.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.360]  Maybe this is the first time you've ever listened to this podcast.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.060]  Maybe it's the second time.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.220]  Maybe it's the third.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:47.620]  If it is the third and you haven't subscribed and liked yet, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.920]  You clearly like it.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.340]  Show us by subscribing and liking.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.160]  And if it is the first and now you think, wow, that was a little aggressive.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:55.900]  I apologize.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.020]  That wasn't meant for you.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.560]  That was meant for the three times people.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.600]  You still have a little bit of time to figure it out.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.400]  We appreciate you.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.120]  See you next week.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.880]  Geoff's new bike is full of ants.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.260]  Gavin smuggled something back from Europe.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.920]  Andrew stars in the return of Krampus.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.620]  The boys get in depth with global economics.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.880]  The director of the tuxedo is pissed.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.040]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.140]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
