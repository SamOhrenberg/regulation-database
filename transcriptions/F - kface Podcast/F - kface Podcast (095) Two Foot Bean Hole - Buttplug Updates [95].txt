[00:14.900 --> 00:16.600]  Is Gavin going to be one minute late?
[00:17.240 --> 00:17.920]  He could be.
[00:18.240 --> 00:18.460]  I think he'll be on time.
[00:18.660 --> 00:20.640]  Oh my god!
[00:21.620 --> 00:22.140]  Incredible.
[00:23.080 --> 00:23.560]  Incredible.
[00:24.360 --> 00:27.200]  There's a 0% chance of pleasantries ever occurring.
[00:27.280 --> 00:30.340]  Which we've been over before.
[00:30.460 --> 00:31.320]  I don't want to bring up a dead thing.
[00:31.640 --> 00:33.580]  But we haven't spoken.
[00:33.920 --> 00:36.580]  I haven't talked to Gavin in a literal month.
[00:37.160 --> 00:38.600]  It's been a month since we talked.
[00:38.900 --> 00:39.300]  Hey Gavin.
[00:39.500 --> 00:39.660]  Hi.
[00:39.660 --> 00:40.340]  Hi.
[00:41.940 --> 00:42.660]  I'm good.
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.240]  I'm okay. I feel a little bloated.
[00:45.440 --> 00:46.220]  If I'm going to be honest.
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.720]  I cooked french fries a little too late to the recording.
[00:49.120 --> 00:50.680]  And I was trying to eat them as quickly as possible.
[00:50.800 --> 00:53.840]  I also had a disgusting lunch.
[00:53.900 --> 00:54.520]  It was awful.
[00:54.800 --> 00:55.380]  What was your lunch?
[00:56.020 --> 00:57.560]  I was panicking.
[00:57.720 --> 00:58.480]  I had about 20 minutes.
[00:58.620 --> 00:59.860]  I had to whip up some soup.
[01:00.060 --> 01:02.440]  But also I'm feeling a bit drowsy.
[01:02.620 --> 01:03.680]  So I thought I'll get a coffee.
[01:03.680 --> 01:05.260]  Hot coffee and hot soup.
[01:05.560 --> 01:06.620]  Absolutely foul.
[01:06.740 --> 01:07.780]  I wouldn't recommend it.
[01:09.620 --> 01:10.420]  Combine both.
[01:10.940 --> 01:12.980]  Put caffeine in the soup.
[01:14.240 --> 01:15.280]  Caffeinated soup?
[01:15.440 --> 01:18.400]  That would have saved me quite a lot of time.
[01:18.760 --> 01:19.800]  Oh my god.
[01:20.560 --> 01:21.080]  Andrew.
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.680]  Can we do caffeinated soup?
[01:22.780 --> 01:24.180]  Two things I don't enjoy much.
[01:25.140 --> 01:26.080]  Oh my god.
[01:26.180 --> 01:27.480]  You just saved so much time.
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.640]  I'm going to get on the phone with Unifarm HQ.
[01:30.640 --> 01:31.980]  Because this could exist.
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.120]  What is this?
[01:34.900 --> 01:36.220]  Whatever that is, I don't care.
[01:37.360 --> 01:38.440]  Who cares about bone broth?
[01:39.040 --> 01:39.520]  Think about it.
[01:39.540 --> 01:41.240]  What are the two things you put in thermoses?
[01:41.600 --> 01:43.220]  You put hot coffee in a thermos.
[01:43.480 --> 01:44.940]  You put soup in a thermos.
[01:45.640 --> 01:48.240]  I like that Eric just sent us a link immediately.
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.660]  Establishing that this is real.
[01:49.820 --> 01:51.200]  And Geoff just wants to ignore it.
[01:51.340 --> 01:52.600]  Just pretend it doesn't exist.
[01:53.680 --> 01:54.740]  It's bone broth.
[01:54.860 --> 01:57.340]  It's a component of a soup.
[01:57.340 --> 01:59.500]  What is bone broth?
[01:59.820 --> 02:00.440]  What is bone broth?
[02:00.640 --> 02:00.860]  What?
[02:04.600 --> 02:05.640]  That's terrible.
[02:06.860 --> 02:08.440]  That's what Andrew would do.
[02:08.800 --> 02:10.060]  It's just an audio podcast.
[02:11.120 --> 02:13.940]  Somebody put soup in a fucking coffee machine.
[02:14.460 --> 02:15.760]  You put noodles in a kettle.
[02:17.200 --> 02:19.320]  I did, but that was...
[02:19.320 --> 02:21.000]  That was a good idea.
[02:21.240 --> 02:21.920]  It's the same thing you did.
[02:22.840 --> 02:25.540]  There's something much grosser about...
[02:25.540 --> 02:26.440]  There's vegetables.
[02:26.700 --> 02:29.120]  No, the vegetables came in later.
[02:29.440 --> 02:30.000]  I don't know.
[02:30.240 --> 02:31.800]  I guarantee you this works.
[02:32.060 --> 02:34.120]  They just run hot water through it and it's fine.
[02:34.620 --> 02:35.020]  For sure.
[02:36.260 --> 02:38.680]  I guess the question is, what else do they do?
[02:39.340 --> 02:40.420]  If you're doing that,
[02:40.760 --> 02:42.220]  your line of what you're going to do
[02:42.220 --> 02:43.880]  is not the same as other people.
[02:44.500 --> 02:46.740]  I'm curious what other inventions they have.
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.040]  Not inventions, but cooking processes.
[02:49.340 --> 02:50.040]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[02:50.760 --> 02:51.560]  I'm good.
[02:51.560 --> 02:52.680]  Let's do this real fast.
[02:52.800 --> 02:55.540]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the
[02:55.540 --> 02:56.820]  F*** Face Podcast.
[02:57.180 --> 02:59.280]  My name is Geoff Ramsey with, as always,
[02:59.420 --> 03:00.800]  Andrew Panton and
[03:01.460 --> 03:02.720]  the other one, Gavin Free.
[03:03.220 --> 03:05.740]  Of course, Nick and Eric are somewhere in the background
[03:05.740 --> 03:07.840]  there being quiet and hilarious in their own rights.
[03:08.180 --> 03:09.620]  And we haven't spoken
[03:09.620 --> 03:11.640]  as a trio in exactly
[03:11.640 --> 03:13.580]  a month. I've spent time with Andrew.
[03:13.820 --> 03:15.700]  We invented a product. We had to stop talking
[03:15.700 --> 03:17.680]  because it was getting too podcast-y.
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.760]  Spent some physical time
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.480]  with Gavin. I'm still sore from it.
[03:22.120 --> 03:23.300]  I don't know how you feel.
[03:24.320 --> 03:26.120]  But we should dive into it.
[03:26.740 --> 03:27.700]  Where do you guys
[03:27.700 --> 03:29.860]  want to start? I want to know why you're
[03:29.860 --> 03:31.860]  sore. What was the physical thing that you two did?
[03:32.340 --> 03:33.260]  Well, was there anything
[03:33.260 --> 03:35.180]  that we had planned a month ago?
[03:35.860 --> 03:37.840]  Andrew? Yeah, but I don't think that's happened
[03:37.840 --> 03:39.560]  yet. The thing I'm thinking of,
[03:39.800 --> 03:41.700]  the baseballs? No, the baseballs happened
[03:41.700 --> 03:43.740]  this weekend. What else? Nick is
[03:43.740 --> 03:45.840]  correct! Oh, you guys did
[03:45.840 --> 03:47.540]  the beanhole? Well,
[03:47.540 --> 03:48.820]  we did
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.760]  some of the beanhole.
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.040]  What does that mean?
[03:53.660 --> 03:55.560]  It means we dug the hole.
[03:57.200 --> 03:57.940]  So you've
[03:57.940 --> 03:59.000]  done none of the beanhole?
[03:59.420 --> 04:00.980]  You've just dug a hole.
[04:01.580 --> 04:03.860]  We did a very hard part of the beanhole.
[04:04.100 --> 04:05.560]  That's the hole. That's exactly
[04:05.560 --> 04:07.640]  half of the work. It's in the name.
[04:08.140 --> 04:09.960]  Yeah. You can't
[04:09.960 --> 04:11.640]  have beanhole without hole. That's
[04:11.640 --> 04:13.620]  true, but the hole... you can do
[04:13.620 --> 04:15.640]  a lot with that hole. That hole doesn't have to be
[04:15.640 --> 04:17.480]  a beanhole yet. You've got options with that hole.
[04:17.820 --> 04:18.940]  Let me just say,
[04:19.560 --> 04:21.660]  before we get into it, fuck that hole.
[04:22.180 --> 04:23.880]  Fuck that hole with everything I have.
[04:24.320 --> 04:25.260]  Fuck my backyard.
[04:25.740 --> 04:26.820]  Fuck my back.
[04:27.380 --> 04:29.940]  Fuck the hammer. Fuck the pry
[04:29.940 --> 04:31.520]  bar that was covered in rust.
[04:31.540 --> 04:33.400]  My hand hurts. I just have rust
[04:33.400 --> 04:35.140]  embedded in my fingers today, Gavin.
[04:35.500 --> 04:37.580]  I was making fun of you for whining about not having a
[04:37.580 --> 04:39.260]  glove yesterday, but today it's just like my
[04:39.260 --> 04:41.580]  fingers are on fire. Fuck the
[04:41.580 --> 04:43.340]  shovel that we bent in half.
[04:43.340 --> 04:45.100]  Fuck the broken wheelbarrow.
[04:45.420 --> 04:47.460]  Fuck the giant cinder block we were
[04:47.460 --> 04:49.560]  trying to use. Fuck everything.
[04:49.860 --> 04:51.100]  How up to date is your tetanus?
[04:51.960 --> 04:53.520]  Uh, it's up to date. I got a tetanus shot
[04:53.520 --> 04:55.380]  last year. Nice. Yeah, I'm good.
[04:55.460 --> 04:57.380]  I'm good. Are there any photos of
[04:57.380 --> 04:59.240]  this? I'd love to see your broken
[04:59.240 --> 05:01.200]  fucking wheelbarrow and your brick.
[05:01.380 --> 05:03.380]  Like, this is... I don't understand how there isn't
[05:03.380 --> 05:05.260]  better coverage of this event. Oh, there's
[05:05.260 --> 05:07.400]  coverage. You just didn't ask to see it.
[05:07.400 --> 05:09.360]  You want to see coverage? Oh, I want to see coverage
[05:09.360 --> 05:11.420]  so badly. Did we decide... if I share my
[05:11.420 --> 05:13.520]  screen, can you hear it? Was that not a thing?
[05:13.660 --> 05:15.440]  Oh, no, it was absolutely a thing we
[05:15.440 --> 05:17.240]  did, but I don't remember the results of it.
[05:17.700 --> 05:19.440]  There was a problem, I think. I don't think we
[05:20.060 --> 05:21.520]  could... well, because it was the slow-mo
[05:21.520 --> 05:22.940]  video, right? With, uh, Geoff?
[05:23.320 --> 05:25.420]  On the bike? The bike trip? Well, yeah. We tried it
[05:25.420 --> 05:27.440]  then. I don't... doesn't matter. Whatever.
[05:27.700 --> 05:29.460]  What if I send it to Eric and Eric
[05:29.460 --> 05:31.580]  can figure it out while I do the, uh,
[05:31.620 --> 05:33.080]  talking part of F*** Face?
[05:33.300 --> 05:35.060]  That sounds great. That sounds like a good plan.
[05:35.660 --> 05:36.480]  Oh, fun, sure.
[05:38.660 --> 05:39.020]  Also,
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.000]  I'll say,
[05:41.600 --> 05:43.200]  before we get into it any further,
[05:43.640 --> 05:45.320]  I will say we didn't complete
[05:45.320 --> 05:47.080]  the beanhole. I mean, first off, you can't
[05:47.080 --> 05:49.140]  complete it in one day. It's a multi-day thing.
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.000]  But there were a few
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.040]  mitigating factors that made us stop.
[05:53.200 --> 05:54.780]  One, physical exhaustion.
[05:55.320 --> 05:57.120]  Two, I have to go out of
[05:57.120 --> 05:59.080]  town tomorrow for the day, and I
[05:59.080 --> 06:01.000]  didn't want to leave my yard on fire and
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.780]  be on a road trip.
[06:03.400 --> 06:04.720]  That seemed irresponsible.
[06:05.360 --> 06:07.140]  Especially, I believe, there's like
[06:07.140 --> 06:09.120]  Texas has like a permanent burn ban going
[06:09.120 --> 06:11.160]  on at all times. So I just didn't want to come
[06:11.160 --> 06:13.360]  home to a pile of rubble or a neighborhood on fire.
[06:14.540 --> 06:14.900]  However,
[06:15.900 --> 06:17.320]  we haven't talked about this with you yet,
[06:17.360 --> 06:19.160]  Eric, I don't think, or Nick, but I think Gavin
[06:19.160 --> 06:21.000]  and I decided after we dug the hole,
[06:21.520 --> 06:23.500]  since we're going to be hitting baseballs
[06:23.500 --> 06:25.220]  all afternoon on Sunday anyway,
[06:25.680 --> 06:26.580]  wouldn't it be great
[06:26.580 --> 06:28.860]  to celebrate
[06:28.860 --> 06:31.500]  the 350 dingers I hit?
[06:32.540 --> 06:33.300]  Come on, I'm back
[06:33.300 --> 06:35.120]  to Geoff's house, and we can all eat
[06:35.120 --> 06:37.320]  some beans together. Yeah, that sounds fun.
[06:37.740 --> 06:38.800]  Gavin and I were thinking,
[06:39.280 --> 06:40.680]  Andrew, we'll mail you some beans.
[06:41.560 --> 06:42.660]  Gavin and I were thinking maybe
[06:42.660 --> 06:45.200]  Saturday morning, we'll get up early Saturday morning
[06:45.200 --> 06:46.980]  and pop the beans in the hole
[06:46.980 --> 06:48.980]  and, you know, set shit on fire
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.180]  and stuff. And then
[06:50.660 --> 06:53.180]  by the time we finish hitting baseballs 24 hours later,
[06:53.280 --> 06:55.300]  they'll be cooked. I think it's a phenomenal idea.
[06:56.560 --> 06:57.000]  Eric,
[06:57.240 --> 06:58.620]  thoughts? I'm for it.
[06:59.080 --> 07:01.020]  I can't think of anything more
[07:01.020 --> 07:03.280]  quenching after 350
[07:03.280 --> 07:05.240]  baseballs than beans that have been sitting
[07:05.240 --> 07:07.220]  in your yard for a day. More quenching
[07:07.220 --> 07:08.880]  than coffee and soup, though. Yes.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.200]  I mean, it's probably, I'll be honest, probably gonna
[07:11.200 --> 07:12.260]  be pretty close.
[07:15.160 --> 07:17.360]  Have you just swung a baseball bat 350
[07:17.360 --> 07:19.180]  times? Come get these red hot beans.
[07:20.460 --> 07:21.260]  You have to do
[07:21.260 --> 07:22.400]  work to get out of the ground.
[07:22.860 --> 07:24.900]  You know that feeling when you're so
[07:24.900 --> 07:27.080]  tired and dehydrated and hot, where
[07:27.080 --> 07:29.300]  it's that feeling that you get rarely where water
[07:29.300 --> 07:31.220]  just tastes so amazing and
[07:31.220 --> 07:33.400]  you just love every second of it going down your gullet?
[07:33.820 --> 07:35.320]  I cannot imagine that with beans.
[07:35.480 --> 07:37.180]  I really don't think we're gonna be able to
[07:37.180 --> 07:38.040]  get the same effect.
[07:39.300 --> 07:41.200]  There's no thirst
[07:41.200 --> 07:43.140]  quench quite like a bean quench.
[07:48.870 --> 07:50.990]  So, I'm just trying to understand
[07:50.990 --> 07:53.230]  the mechanics of this. You're gonna, so you put
[07:53.230 --> 07:54.630]  the beans in the hole.
[07:54.930 --> 07:56.830]  Once you make the beans, you put them in a pot.
[07:57.410 --> 07:58.730]  Pot goes in the hole.
[07:59.050 --> 08:01.030]  You then have to fill the
[08:01.030 --> 08:02.450]  hole again, correct?
[08:03.210 --> 08:05.030]  Yeah, so what you do is you put them
[08:05.030 --> 08:06.970]  in a cast iron, like a dutch oven.
[08:07.030 --> 08:08.810]  Then you triple seal it with
[08:09.330 --> 08:11.130]  with like saran wrap.
[08:11.230 --> 08:12.190]  Not saran wrap, but tin foil.
[08:12.830 --> 08:14.990]  Or aluminum foil. And then you
[08:14.990 --> 08:16.810]  pour hot coals all over it.
[08:17.070 --> 08:18.930]  And then you seal that
[08:18.930 --> 08:20.990]  into the ground and then put a couple feet
[08:20.990 --> 08:23.030]  of dirt on top of it. Okay, so you're gonna have
[08:23.030 --> 08:25.170]  to re-dig the hole after all of this
[08:25.170 --> 08:26.910]  as well. Yeah, for sure.
[08:27.150 --> 08:29.050]  Okay. And how deep
[08:29.050 --> 08:31.050]  is the hole? How deep is the hole?
[08:31.290 --> 08:32.590]  Uh, Gavin, how deep is the hole?
[08:35.510 --> 08:37.350]  He might be measuring it right now.
[08:37.430 --> 08:38.490]  I think he left the measure.
[08:38.750 --> 08:40.530]  Where did he go? I have no idea.
[08:41.210 --> 08:43.010]  Maybe he's getting his dinklages stick.
[08:43.730 --> 08:44.770]  You're gonna have to guess.
[08:45.110 --> 08:46.850]  What would you guess?
[08:46.870 --> 08:48.890]  Are you incapable of guessing how deep the hole is?
[08:49.190 --> 08:50.950]  I have a pretty good idea how deep
[08:50.950 --> 08:53.010]  the hole is. I was just trying to work Gavin
[08:53.010 --> 08:54.750]  into it for a reason. I'll show you here in a second.
[08:55.550 --> 08:56.950]  I was trying to work Gavin
[08:56.950 --> 08:59.130]  into it because of what's going
[08:59.130 --> 09:00.930]  on in this photo that I'm posting to the
[09:00.930 --> 09:01.710]  Discord right now.
[09:02.850 --> 09:05.030]  What am I looking at? You're looking at a guy
[09:05.030 --> 09:07.130]  with a gas-powered leaf blower
[09:07.130 --> 09:09.030]  five feet from me blowing leaves
[09:09.030 --> 09:11.090]  in my backyard that I didn't know my girlfriend
[09:11.090 --> 09:13.010]  scheduled somehow during the
[09:13.010 --> 09:14.530]  podcast. So I was trying not to
[09:15.110 --> 09:16.110]  talk for a second.
[09:17.070 --> 09:18.070]  Gavin, are you here?
[09:19.350 --> 09:19.830]  Ooh.
[09:20.970 --> 09:22.630]  Ooh. Is somebody printing
[09:22.630 --> 09:24.730]  loss? Are you okay?
[09:24.730 --> 09:26.810]  Well, I've just realized this computer's been on
[09:26.810 --> 09:28.810]  for, well, a month without being
[09:28.810 --> 09:30.130]  used. And it's really
[09:31.150 --> 09:32.470]  struggling to open Slack.
[09:32.810 --> 09:34.150]  I'm trying to Slack you.
[09:34.910 --> 09:36.450]  I'm trying to Slack Eric this
[09:36.450 --> 09:38.690]  link to the dig, the hole video.
[09:39.090 --> 09:40.710]  And it's just, it sort of
[09:40.710 --> 09:42.710]  loads a new piece, and then I can't hear anything
[09:42.710 --> 09:44.310]  for a minute, and then it loads a little bit more.
[09:44.670 --> 09:45.870]  Welcome to my world!
[09:46.370 --> 09:47.290]  This is great!
[09:49.390 --> 09:50.830]  Andrewed my computer while I've been
[09:50.830 --> 09:52.790]  away, Andrew? I think you've just done it by
[09:52.790 --> 09:54.930]  being away. I can't take credit for that.
[09:56.570 --> 09:57.030]  I'd
[09:57.030 --> 09:58.790]  say the hole's two feet deep. What do you
[09:58.790 --> 10:00.590]  think, Gavin? That's it! All of that fucking
[10:00.590 --> 10:02.530]  every, all of that! Two feet!
[10:02.530 --> 10:04.810]  You don't dig a hole! Two feet!
[10:06.350 --> 10:06.910]  I'm gonna
[10:06.910 --> 10:08.590]  tell you, I'm gonna tell you
[10:08.590 --> 10:10.730]  what I told Gavin in the moment when I was
[10:10.730 --> 10:11.570]  between breaths.
[10:12.990 --> 10:14.630]  Every scene in every
[10:14.630 --> 10:16.670]  movie where somebody gets
[10:16.670 --> 10:18.770]  murdered or accidentally hit by a
[10:18.770 --> 10:20.610]  car, and they have to cover it up by
[10:20.610 --> 10:22.570]  digging a real
[10:22.570 --> 10:24.290]  grave to put the body in,
[10:24.630 --> 10:26.550]  in the woods at night, like
[10:26.550 --> 10:28.510]  lit by a car, is
[10:28.510 --> 10:30.830]  bullshit. It is impossible
[10:30.830 --> 10:32.490]  to dig a human-sized hole.
[10:32.910 --> 10:34.450]  Fuck you, every
[10:34.450 --> 10:36.350]  director in the history
[10:36.350 --> 10:38.570]  of film who has put that
[10:38.570 --> 10:40.430]  into a movie. You're a fucking liar
[10:40.430 --> 10:42.590]  who's never dug a fucking hole in
[10:42.590 --> 10:44.530]  your fucking life. That's what I'll say.
[10:44.750 --> 10:46.330]  I'll also say this, too, because
[10:46.330 --> 10:50.590]  my entire house, I'm sorry, Gavin, I
[10:50.590 --> 10:52.730]  rock. I guarantee you
[10:53.610 --> 10:54.570]  more murders
[10:54.570 --> 10:56.530]  go solved in Texas because
[10:56.530 --> 10:58.510]  of the ground than any other state.
[10:59.710 --> 11:00.450]  Two feet!
[11:00.570 --> 11:01.030]  Gavin, go ahead.
[11:02.050 --> 11:04.470]  Well, yeah, in films, I feel like it would be really
[11:04.470 --> 11:06.410]  easy to get an accurate representation
[11:06.410 --> 11:08.550]  because, you know, the actors stood
[11:08.550 --> 11:10.330]  next to the hole they've just, in quotes,
[11:10.490 --> 11:12.550]  dug are probably actually stood next
[11:12.550 --> 11:14.430]  to just two people from the art
[11:14.430 --> 11:16.370]  department who actually just dug the hole.
[11:16.610 --> 11:18.450]  So just mimic what they're doing
[11:18.450 --> 11:19.890]  and you'd have an accurate representation.
[11:20.410 --> 11:21.470]  They have tools.
[11:22.690 --> 11:23.630]  What tools do you have?
[11:24.250 --> 11:26.410]  Can we recap what you had for your
[11:26.410 --> 11:27.150]  two foot hole?
[11:28.410 --> 11:30.030]  What tools? Why don't you watch
[11:30.030 --> 11:32.170]  the video? I'd love to watch the video.
[11:32.490 --> 11:34.330]  Oh my god. Okay, I'm gonna see if this works.
[11:34.830 --> 11:36.230]  Oh boy. It's only about a minute.
[11:37.070 --> 11:38.410]  Yeah, okay. We're gonna
[11:38.410 --> 11:40.370]  notify. We have, okay. We're gonna
[11:40.370 --> 11:42.190]  see what happens. Here we go. Can everyone
[11:42.190 --> 11:44.570]  see feet? Uh, hold on.
[11:44.730 --> 11:46.370]  Yeah. Okay. Swap over.
[11:46.370 --> 11:48.230]  Oh, I can see feet. Yeah.
[11:48.350 --> 11:49.770]  Watch stream. Okay, here it comes.
[11:50.050 --> 11:51.230]  This will be on our YouTube page.
[11:52.550 --> 11:53.070]  laughter
[11:54.130 --> 11:54.650]  laughter
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.120]  The well-prepared
[12:04.120 --> 12:05.020]  tool of a hammer.
[12:06.280 --> 12:06.800]  laughter
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.080]  laughter
[12:21.890 --> 12:22.410]  laughter
[12:22.410 --> 12:23.170]  laughter
[12:23.170 --> 12:23.330]  laughter
[12:23.330 --> 12:23.390]  laughter
[12:25.610 --> 12:27.830]  The foot is halfway
[12:27.830 --> 12:28.990]  above the hole.
[12:32.290 --> 12:33.950]  If you put a shoe on that
[12:33.950 --> 12:35.450]  pot, it would be above ground.
[12:37.150 --> 12:37.590]  laughter
[12:42.200 --> 12:44.120]  That was like a heist movie
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.040]  where like everything, like a comedy
[12:46.040 --> 12:48.000]  heist film where literally everything
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.120]  goes wrong. That was amazing.
[12:50.660 --> 12:52.240]  That was an hour cut down
[12:52.240 --> 12:53.600]  to about a minute.
[12:53.960 --> 12:56.080]  I was about to say, what did you have? About 60 minutes of footage
[12:56.080 --> 12:58.160]  there? Oh yeah. I had at least 50
[12:58.160 --> 12:58.800]  something minutes.
[12:59.800 --> 13:00.280]  laughter
[13:01.120 --> 13:03.240]  Can I ask a question?
[13:04.660 --> 13:06.260]  Yeah. Why did you try to
[13:06.260 --> 13:07.740]  dig through the rock? Yeah.
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.060]  Instead of another hole like around
[13:10.060 --> 13:12.040]  it. We were having trouble
[13:12.040 --> 13:14.360]  digging around it. We didn't know how big it was so then we thought
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.180]  what if we split it in half
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.260]  and then just dig it up in pieces.
[13:18.800 --> 13:20.460]  It's like the worst
[13:20.460 --> 13:22.240]  like you're fucking Andy
[13:22.240 --> 13:24.240]  Dufresne trying to get through a rock
[13:24.240 --> 13:25.660]  like I don't understand.
[13:25.660 --> 13:27.680]  Yeah and unfortunately we didn't have any
[13:27.680 --> 13:29.380]  spoons. Did you not?
[13:30.140 --> 13:31.900]  We also didn't have either of you
[13:31.900 --> 13:33.260]  two idiots there helping us.
[13:33.640 --> 13:35.900]  I would have just said let's dig a different hole.
[13:36.480 --> 13:37.440]  Fuck you dude!
[13:37.920 --> 13:39.700]  We're three shovels into this
[13:39.700 --> 13:40.140]  rock.
[13:41.660 --> 13:43.160]  Here man, we didn't
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.340]  it was a while before we realized
[13:46.120 --> 13:48.000]  yeah, in retrospect
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.720]  should we, the second we hit that
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.280]  rock, have stopped?
[13:51.560 --> 13:53.720]  Of course. We should have gone to a different spot
[13:53.720 --> 13:55.740]  of the yard. Although I gotta be honest with you
[13:55.740 --> 13:57.640]  there were at least three
[13:57.640 --> 13:59.840]  rocks that size in the vicinity
[13:59.840 --> 14:01.380]  of that because we touched them all
[14:01.380 --> 14:02.660]  I have no
[14:03.500 --> 14:05.780]  I'm pretty certain that there's a rock every
[14:05.780 --> 14:07.540]  six inches like that in my yard. So
[14:07.540 --> 14:09.700]  it wouldn't have mattered. We would have just had a bunch of
[14:09.700 --> 14:11.300]  third dug holes all over the yard.
[14:11.320 --> 14:13.540]  The whole place is like natural bean hole prevention.
[14:14.080 --> 14:14.320]  Yeah.
[14:15.220 --> 14:17.500]  I just, there was not even an, like I understand
[14:17.500 --> 14:19.440]  what you're saying but the fact that there wasn't even
[14:19.440 --> 14:21.680]  attempt at a hole too is what is wild
[14:21.680 --> 14:23.760]  to me. Not that you're not right, like you could
[14:23.760 --> 14:25.760]  be totally right, but I don't understand
[14:25.760 --> 14:26.900]  being married to that hole.
[14:27.160 --> 14:29.320]  Do you know why we found the second rock?
[14:29.520 --> 14:31.740]  There's another rock here! The third rock.
[14:31.800 --> 14:33.520]  It's because we decided
[14:33.520 --> 14:35.620]  to shift the hole over
[14:35.620 --> 14:37.200]  away from the second rock
[14:37.200 --> 14:39.500]  and as we did that, like the hole
[14:39.500 --> 14:41.240]  you don't notice it but it gets bigger at the end
[14:41.240 --> 14:43.820]  because we did essentially what you're saying Andrew
[14:43.820 --> 14:45.820]  we stretched the hole
[14:45.820 --> 14:47.440]  out to the right and hit another
[14:47.440 --> 14:49.720]  fucking rock. You're just
[14:49.720 --> 14:51.620]  making that hole wider. That's not a different
[14:51.620 --> 14:52.980]  hole. You're just extending
[14:52.980 --> 14:55.780]  your base hole. I'd move to a completely
[14:55.780 --> 14:56.720]  different part of the yard.
[14:57.600 --> 14:59.420]  It would be the same result dude!
[14:59.880 --> 15:00.920]  I don't know if you know that.
[15:01.680 --> 15:03.860]  I'm pretty sure. Based on the video
[15:03.860 --> 15:05.700]  I just saw, I don't think you're an expert in this
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.740]  field in any way.
[15:07.240 --> 15:09.700]  There's zero opinion you could just have without
[15:09.700 --> 15:11.700]  trying that I'd believe based on your
[15:11.700 --> 15:13.740]  expertise. Well here's what we're gonna
[15:13.740 --> 15:15.700]  have to do. So that I can
[15:15.700 --> 15:17.540]  respect your opinion on holes,
[15:17.540 --> 15:19.420]  we're gonna need you to turn in a video of you
[15:19.420 --> 15:21.440]  digging a hole. Showing us how it's done.
[15:21.620 --> 15:22.820]  Maybe do like a Bob Vila
[15:24.960 --> 15:25.760]  home improvement
[15:25.760 --> 15:26.960]  style video. I love this idea.
[15:27.580 --> 15:29.560]  Explaining how to properly dig a hole
[15:29.560 --> 15:31.220]  as Canadians do.
[15:31.980 --> 15:33.540]  Listen, it has to be in your yard
[15:33.540 --> 15:35.560]  first of all, because every terrain
[15:35.560 --> 15:37.660]  is different. So if we're really comparing
[15:37.660 --> 15:39.180]  if we're trying to make my point
[15:39.920 --> 15:41.560]  accurate, it's that you could
[15:41.560 --> 15:43.520]  have dug a much easier better hole
[15:43.520 --> 15:45.500]  with a lot less effort. So it'd have to be
[15:45.500 --> 15:47.260]  in your yard. It is challenging
[15:47.260 --> 15:49.540]  in a million ways. I think by the time
[15:49.540 --> 15:51.540]  we've done the actual bean hole
[15:51.540 --> 15:52.560]  and eaten the beans
[15:53.800 --> 15:55.580]  it'll be enough for like a full
[15:55.580 --> 15:57.860]  half an hour episode on our YouTube channel
[15:57.860 --> 15:59.540]  of just the bean hole experience.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.520]  Because there's so much footage.
[16:02.240 --> 16:03.700]  I can't wait. I haven't even put the beans yet.
[16:04.060 --> 16:05.500]  I can't wait for another food
[16:05.500 --> 16:07.540]  review where I just watch you guys all eat
[16:07.540 --> 16:09.500]  and talk about how good the food is. That's gonna
[16:09.500 --> 16:11.400]  be great. A follow up. That's our whole
[16:11.400 --> 16:13.300]  gimmick. Well as we know,
[16:13.300 --> 16:15.420]  you will not set foot in the U.S. until
[16:15.960 --> 16:16.820]  after June.
[16:17.860 --> 16:18.520]  That's true.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.440]  And if you did come to the U.S. in June
[16:21.440 --> 16:23.100]  it wouldn't be Vegas, that's for sure.
[16:23.660 --> 16:24.800]  Not till the fall.
[16:25.420 --> 16:27.400]  That supplemental was great
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.180]  and it's hard to believe that there's
[16:29.180 --> 16:31.680]  20 minutes before...
[16:31.680 --> 16:33.280]  I think just like... I don't know
[16:33.280 --> 16:35.180]  if sometimes people miss them. We release
[16:35.180 --> 16:37.300]  supplemental content sometimes and it's generally on our
[16:37.300 --> 16:39.060]  feed. I think it almost always is.
[16:39.220 --> 16:41.200]  But if you haven't listened to it, there's
[16:41.200 --> 16:43.080]  a supplemental that is just titled
[16:43.080 --> 16:45.240]  Eric's Job, I believe, of just
[16:45.240 --> 16:47.180]  us trying to schedule the
[16:47.180 --> 16:49.180]  block of episodes we have to do as well as something
[16:49.180 --> 16:51.020]  in the future. And that was
[16:51.020 --> 16:53.180]  45 minutes long. I need
[16:53.180 --> 16:55.140]  you... I just need to... I need
[16:55.140 --> 16:57.320]  to share this. I saw Geoff
[16:57.320 --> 16:59.240]  yesterday before he dug a
[16:59.240 --> 16:59.940]  hole for beans.
[17:00.960 --> 17:03.260]  And then he asked
[17:03.260 --> 17:05.280]  why we scheduled so
[17:05.280 --> 17:07.380]  much in one week
[17:07.380 --> 17:09.220]  like he wasn't in
[17:09.220 --> 17:09.880]  the recording.
[17:10.740 --> 17:12.960]  And then we released the thing
[17:12.960 --> 17:14.840]  where we all agreed
[17:14.840 --> 17:16.520]  when it would be scheduled.
[17:17.040 --> 17:18.760]  We scheduled two
[17:18.760 --> 17:21.460]  faces, a bean hole,
[17:22.480 --> 17:23.120]  MVP2
[17:23.120 --> 17:25.560]  watch-along, and baseballs
[17:25.560 --> 17:27.520]  all in seven days.
[17:27.680 --> 17:29.340]  And we're gonna do all of it but one
[17:29.340 --> 17:30.640]  when it's all said and done.
[17:31.100 --> 17:33.280]  You almost cancelled bean hole, but we...
[17:33.280 --> 17:34.140]  I tried, man.
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.220]  I was just happy that all of my stuff
[17:37.880 --> 17:39.280]  worked out. I got back
[17:39.280 --> 17:41.080]  in time. I was available for all of those
[17:41.080 --> 17:43.480]  super in the future calendar invites.
[17:43.780 --> 17:45.200]  And that it was gonna be
[17:45.200 --> 17:47.200]  Geoff in the end who was gonna cancel it.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.220]  I did have to cancel the
[17:49.220 --> 17:50.860]  MVP2. I apologize for that.
[17:51.220 --> 17:53.000]  I will accept all the blame for that one.
[17:53.100 --> 17:55.400]  But I am devoting my entire weekend
[17:55.400 --> 17:57.460]  to beans and baseballs.
[17:57.620 --> 17:59.240]  And so I feel like
[17:59.240 --> 18:00.880]  there's redemption in that alone.
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.560]  Geoff felt so bad about cancelling MVP2.
[18:03.680 --> 18:05.220]  On Friday, he texted me personally
[18:05.220 --> 18:05.660]  about it.
[18:06.640 --> 18:07.660]  Out of character.
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.900]  I'm excited. We'll eventually watch it.
[18:11.520 --> 18:13.320]  We'll get there. We'll do it next week.
[18:13.440 --> 18:15.160]  I watched the first one
[18:15.160 --> 18:17.140]  because you said in passing, Gavin,
[18:17.180 --> 18:19.060]  I feel like you were joking that I need to record
[18:19.060 --> 18:21.140]  a recap for you guys to get into part
[18:21.140 --> 18:22.620]  two to know where the story's going.
[18:23.120 --> 18:25.000]  I wanted you to edit the movie down into
[18:25.000 --> 18:25.620]  a summary.
[18:26.540 --> 18:29.000]  That's what I'm doing with my recording. I took notes.
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.780]  I watched it with notes. I'm ready.
[18:30.900 --> 18:32.700]  I'm ready to record a three minute
[18:32.700 --> 18:34.020]  version of MVP.
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.880]  That was not a throwaway comment.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.560]  That's a necessity.
[18:37.720 --> 18:38.220]  What's happening?
[18:43.020 --> 18:45.700]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey, the easy way to save
[18:45.700 --> 18:47.620]  when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[18:48.120 --> 18:49.220]  I love to shop online.
[18:49.480 --> 18:51.120]  It's essentially the only way I do shop.
[18:51.260 --> 18:53.420]  I hate going to stores, but when I shop online,
[18:53.820 --> 18:55.240]  I never have a promo code ready.
[18:55.620 --> 18:57.540]  Thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon
[18:57.540 --> 18:58.840]  codes is a thing of the past.
[18:59.360 --> 19:01.520]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the
[19:01.520 --> 19:03.540]  internet for promo codes and applies the best one
[19:03.540 --> 19:05.540]  it finds to your cart. How it works?
[19:05.940 --> 19:07.560]  Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite
[19:07.560 --> 19:09.400]  sites. When you check out, the Honey button
[19:09.400 --> 19:11.300]  appears and all you have to do is click apply
[19:11.300 --> 19:13.500]  coupons. Wait a few seconds as Honey
[19:13.500 --> 19:15.540]  searches for coupons it can find for that site.
[19:15.960 --> 19:17.500]  If Honey finds a working
[19:17.500 --> 19:19.180]  coupon, you'll watch the prices drop.
[19:19.860 --> 19:21.600]  I personally use Honey all the time.
[19:21.760 --> 19:23.660]  It's fantastic. It's so easy to use.
[19:23.780 --> 19:25.020]  It allows you to save money.
[19:25.480 --> 19:27.640]  Times you don't even expect it. I recently bought
[19:27.640 --> 19:29.560]  some clothes and I saved money on that.
[19:29.940 --> 19:31.000]  It's a great service.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.100]  Honey doesn't just work on desktop,
[19:33.400 --> 19:34.620]  it works on your iPhone too.
[19:34.900 --> 19:37.080]  Just activate it on Safari on your phone
[19:37.080 --> 19:39.180]  and save on the go. If you don't
[19:39.180 --> 19:40.980]  already have Honey, you could be straight up
[19:40.980 --> 19:42.940]  missing out. And by getting it, you'll be doing
[19:42.940 --> 19:44.720]  yourself a solid and supporting the show.
[19:44.840 --> 19:47.020]  So thank you very much. I never recommend something
[19:47.020 --> 19:49.040]  I don't use. Get Honey for free

[19:57.680 --> 19:58.720]  Relationships take work.
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.680]  A lot of us will drop anything to go help
[20:00.680 --> 20:02.620]  someone we care about. We'll go out of our way
[20:02.620 --> 20:04.800]  to treat other people well, but how often
[20:04.800 --> 20:06.320]  do we give ourselves the same treatment?
[20:06.880 --> 20:08.460]  Investing in yourself is super important.
[20:08.700 --> 20:10.620]  It's a thing that I have struggled with
[20:10.620 --> 20:12.740]  at times. I've found different
[20:12.740 --> 20:14.540]  ways to do it. Games, video games
[20:14.540 --> 20:16.580]  have been really helpful. Movies, there's
[20:16.580 --> 20:18.640]  a place where I used to live. I used
[20:18.640 --> 20:20.600]  to go walk there. Just walks can be great
[20:20.600 --> 20:22.640]  to clear your head. But this
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.600]  month, BetterHelp Online Therapy
[20:24.600 --> 20:26.560]  wants to remind you to take care of your most
[20:26.560 --> 20:28.640]  important relationship, the one you have with yourself.
[20:29.220 --> 20:30.700]  Whether it's hitting the gym, making time
[20:30.700 --> 20:32.320]  for your haircut, or even trying therapy,
[20:32.480 --> 20:34.300]  you are your greatest asset.
[20:34.600 --> 20:36.480]  So invest the time and effort into yourself
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.580]  like you do for other people. I've talked about
[20:38.580 --> 20:40.620]  this every time with this ad as well. If you're
[20:40.620 --> 20:42.760]  somebody who is on the fence or considering therapy,
[20:43.260 --> 20:44.400]  I would highly recommend
[20:44.980 --> 20:46.480]  you try it. It was something
[20:46.480 --> 20:48.600]  that was very helpful for me. It was something
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.780]  that I was reluctant to do initially,
[20:50.980 --> 20:52.440]  but I did it
[20:52.440 --> 20:54.520]  and I found it to be incredibly
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.340]  helpful and sorting
[20:56.340 --> 20:58.640]  through things that I didn't necessarily even realize
[20:58.640 --> 21:00.600]  I needed to sort through. So if it's
[21:00.600 --> 21:02.620]  something that you're opening or considering, please
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.480]  give it a try. BetterHelp is online
[21:04.480 --> 21:06.600]  therapy that offers video, phone, and even
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.580]  live chat sessions with your therapist, so you don't
[21:08.580 --> 21:10.400]  have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[21:10.660 --> 21:12.580]  It's a much more affordable than in-person
[21:12.580 --> 21:14.780]  therapy and you can be matched with a therapist
[21:14.780 --> 21:16.600]  in under 48 hours. Give it

[22:12.640 --> 22:14.300]  Austin July 1st through 3rd.
[22:15.780 --> 22:16.680]  And when we're speaking
[22:16.680 --> 22:18.660]  about childhood, we should talk about
[22:18.660 --> 22:20.400]  the Donkey Kong 64 bet
[22:20.400 --> 22:22.220]  because we haven't actually talked about the conclusion
[22:22.860 --> 22:24.100]  on the show.
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.620]  What are all the dangling comedic threads
[22:26.620 --> 22:28.720]  we have to pull and wrap up
[22:28.720 --> 22:30.660]  here? We have that bet for sure.
[22:30.840 --> 22:31.600]  Anything else out there?
[22:32.460 --> 22:34.260]  I also want an update on
[22:34.260 --> 22:35.760]  Andrew's mom's butt plugs.
[22:36.340 --> 22:38.360]  I do have an update on that as well.
[22:38.540 --> 22:40.480]  Survey update. The survey
[22:40.480 --> 22:42.460]  is continuing to happen. Every
[22:42.460 --> 22:44.580]  once in a while we'll be talking and then she'll just be like
[22:44.580 --> 22:45.460]  yeah, ask this person.
[22:47.240 --> 22:47.920]  They do.
[22:48.160 --> 22:49.660]  I will say it's been a roll of
[22:49.660 --> 22:51.640]  do not know what it is. It's been
[22:51.640 --> 22:53.760]  quite the chain. I think the last four people
[22:53.760 --> 22:54.740]  haven't heard of butt plugs.
[22:56.020 --> 22:57.620]  The last four people, are they
[22:57.620 --> 22:59.120]  all around your mom's age?
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.700]  Yes. They're all around
[23:01.700 --> 23:03.880]  the same age. I think there is generational
[23:03.880 --> 23:05.100]  butt plug blindness.
[23:05.720 --> 23:07.060]  You think so? Yeah.
[23:08.720 --> 23:09.620]  Funny enough, that's
[23:09.620 --> 23:11.520]  what butt plugs originally were supposed to cure.
[23:11.800 --> 23:12.220]  It was blindness.
[23:12.220 --> 23:15.920]  That's a real medical cure.
[23:16.480 --> 23:18.440]  That's the funniest joke you've ever said.
[23:19.000 --> 23:19.700]  That's good.
[23:24.140 --> 23:25.020]  Donkey Kong.
[23:25.400 --> 23:26.240]  Donkey Kong.
[23:26.440 --> 23:30.060]  Donkey Kong was a journey. Just to recap
[23:30.060 --> 23:32.260]  what the bet was. It's going to be very weird for people
[23:32.260 --> 23:34.180]  because this will just be like nothing's ever changed
[23:34.180 --> 23:35.300]  and we haven't spoken in a month.
[23:36.520 --> 23:38.200]  What was that? 48 hours,
[23:38.300 --> 23:39.760]  right? To beat all of Donkey Kong?
[23:39.760 --> 23:41.640]  Was it 44 and I could ask for
[23:41.640 --> 23:43.820]  four more hours within the first six or some
[23:43.820 --> 23:45.900]  bullshit? I feel like I got tricked.
[23:46.080 --> 23:47.480]  I'm just going to say that before you continue.
[23:47.700 --> 23:49.060]  I feel like I got bollocked.
[23:49.120 --> 23:51.760]  Let me talk about how big of a fucking asshole
[23:51.760 --> 23:53.800]  Gavin is for a minute. Just let me pivot to
[23:53.800 --> 23:54.800]  this. So I start
[23:55.580 --> 23:57.660]  the stream. I was furious
[23:57.660 --> 23:59.800]  with you and it's not your fault. It was bad
[23:59.800 --> 24:01.180]  timing. Not a real comment.
[24:01.980 --> 24:03.800]  I started the stream and I don't know
[24:03.800 --> 24:05.740]  if you remember this, Gavin, but apparently there is no
[24:05.740 --> 24:07.740]  gameplay audio when I stream
[24:07.740 --> 24:09.620]  to you as just Andrew the Donkey Kong guy.
[24:09.700 --> 24:11.040]  I could have swore there was,
[24:11.700 --> 24:13.300]  but I didn't change anything
[24:13.300 --> 24:15.400]  and there was no game audio
[24:15.400 --> 24:17.740]  at the start of the stream. So I get ready to
[24:17.740 --> 24:19.740]  go. We've been talking about it.
[24:19.760 --> 24:21.660]  I launch at midnight on
[24:21.660 --> 24:23.760]  Saturday. I'm going to play.
[24:24.140 --> 24:25.160]  Nobody can hear anything.
[24:25.760 --> 24:27.780]  I have no idea what's wrong. I didn't realize this would be
[24:27.780 --> 24:29.380]  an issue. Everything's broken.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.140]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[24:31.600 --> 24:33.720]  It takes me 50 or
[24:33.720 --> 24:35.740]  so minutes to figure out why
[24:35.740 --> 24:37.920]  it's not working. I have to download
[24:37.920 --> 24:39.360]  an application for it.
[24:39.720 --> 24:41.520]  Apparently streaming game audio through OBS
[24:41.520 --> 24:43.680]  is a nightmare. So I have to install
[24:43.680 --> 24:45.840]  these plugins. So then I eventually get the game audio
[24:45.840 --> 24:47.700]  going. That's working. But I've
[24:47.700 --> 24:49.640]  burnt my first hour. So I don't
[24:49.640 --> 24:51.660]  even start Donkey Kong until
[24:51.660 --> 24:53.740]  1 AM. So then I start playing
[24:53.740 --> 24:55.640]  and it's going well. I'm playing through
[24:55.640 --> 24:57.800]  the game and the audio
[24:57.800 --> 24:59.480]  stops working once again.
[24:59.780 --> 25:01.560]  And I was like, ah, that's an annoying thing.
[25:01.600 --> 25:04.020]  I'm checking through my settings. It's not OBS.
[25:04.020 --> 25:05.480]  It's specifically
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.060]  with the emulator I'm using. And I can't do
[25:08.060 --> 25:10.060]  anything to fix it. So I thought, you know what?
[25:10.780 --> 25:12.020]  I'd want this to be the
[25:12.020 --> 25:13.900]  best experience possible for the people.
[25:14.140 --> 25:16.140]  I'll save my game and I'll
[25:16.140 --> 25:18.020]  reboot my emulator and then we'll go
[25:18.020 --> 25:20.060]  back to it. They'll have audio. So I do all that
[25:20.060 --> 25:22.160]  and it doesn't remember my save
[25:22.160 --> 25:24.080]  file. So I played for
[25:24.080 --> 25:25.940]  one hour. First
[25:25.940 --> 25:27.840]  hour, 12 to 1, technical
[25:27.840 --> 25:29.840]  difficulties. Play for an hour,
[25:30.240 --> 25:32.000]  1 to 2, the audio
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.980]  breaks. I lose my save file.
[25:34.280 --> 25:35.900]  I'm back at the beginning. In that
[25:35.900 --> 25:38.280]  window of time in which I had reset
[25:38.280 --> 25:40.080]  the game, I'd been trying to play
[25:40.080 --> 25:41.920]  for two hours at this point. I take the stream
[25:41.920 --> 25:43.940]  offline for like three minutes
[25:43.940 --> 25:46.180]  to reboot it. And Gavin texts me,
[25:46.580 --> 25:48.060]  hey, where's my stream?
[25:48.400 --> 25:50.180]  You told me you'd be streaming this.
[25:50.560 --> 25:51.820]  Where is it? And I'm like,
[25:51.900 --> 25:54.360]  you motherfucker. I'm resetting
[25:54.360 --> 25:56.080]  it for a minute and I'm pretty sure
[25:56.080 --> 25:57.520]  I'm going to lose all my progress.
[25:57.860 --> 25:59.940]  Go fuck yourself. That's where my stream is.
[26:00.420 --> 26:01.220]  If only
[26:01.780 --> 26:03.880]  this had happened before and we warned
[26:03.880 --> 26:05.920]  you about this shitty emulator setup
[26:06.520 --> 26:06.920]  and
[26:07.680 --> 26:09.780]  what, you just decided it would be fine this time?
[26:09.800 --> 26:12.020]  Well, I think what you told us was this is the easiest
[26:12.020 --> 26:13.820]  solution and I've already done it
[26:13.820 --> 26:15.740]  and I know it works. To be fair, okay.
[26:16.420 --> 26:17.880]  I think there is a way to
[26:17.880 --> 26:19.680]  save. I just don't know how to do it. I had
[26:19.680 --> 26:21.560]  changed the emulator I was using.
[26:21.820 --> 26:24.020]  Control-S. Previously.
[26:24.320 --> 26:25.520]  And I think there is a
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.420]  control-S. That was funny.
[26:28.560 --> 26:29.800]  I just can't.
[26:29.900 --> 26:31.080]  I don't know. I need to figure that out.
[26:31.180 --> 26:33.540]  So anyway, that increases the risk for me
[26:33.540 --> 26:35.640]  because if at any point my emulator
[26:35.640 --> 26:37.600]  crashes, my computer, like the power goes
[26:37.600 --> 26:39.360]  off for a minute, if my emulator
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.540]  goes down, I lose all of my progress
[26:41.540 --> 26:43.280]  no matter where I'm at. I cannot save.
[26:43.380 --> 26:44.480]  I need to keep everything going.
[26:45.400 --> 26:47.280]  So I played, I think,
[26:47.360 --> 26:49.520]  from 2am until 8am,
[26:50.220 --> 26:51.020]  fell asleep,
[26:51.580 --> 26:53.460]  woke up two hours later and didn't
[26:53.460 --> 26:55.320]  sleep again the rest of the way.
[26:55.320 --> 26:57.360]  It took me 29 hours
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.340]  to beat Donkey Kong 64. I think
[26:59.340 --> 27:01.380]  I played like 26 of those 29
[27:01.380 --> 27:01.840]  hours.
[27:03.180 --> 27:05.580]  It was a grind. 26 hours
[27:05.580 --> 27:07.400]  to beat it. That was not the
[27:07.400 --> 27:09.120]  quoted time that you said.
[27:09.480 --> 27:11.620]  So what I realized is
[27:12.120 --> 27:13.360]  the game fucking sucks.
[27:13.480 --> 27:15.060]  I already knew that. It's a terrible game.
[27:15.700 --> 27:17.540]  In the middle of this experience
[27:17.540 --> 27:19.360]  I had the realization that I don't
[27:19.360 --> 27:21.120]  think I've hated anybody's childhood
[27:21.120 --> 27:23.360]  more than Gavin's. Between the Tuxedo
[27:23.360 --> 27:25.500]  and Donkey Kong 64
[27:26.280 --> 27:27.480]  your childhood was
[27:27.480 --> 27:29.080]  atrocious as far as entertainment.
[27:30.000 --> 27:30.980]  They're not together.
[27:31.260 --> 27:33.240]  I didn't like the Tuxedo but I loved
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.120]  Donkey Kong 64. But it's all part of your
[27:35.120 --> 27:37.500]  childhood. We keep dabbling
[27:37.500 --> 27:39.440]  into your childhood and everything about it
[27:39.440 --> 27:41.160]  stinks. It's not fun.
[27:41.680 --> 27:42.120]  It's true.
[27:42.940 --> 27:45.340]  The game is atrocious. So how it works is
[27:45.340 --> 27:47.300]  you need bananas. You need golden
[27:47.300 --> 27:49.540]  bananas to open doors and then you need
[27:49.540 --> 27:51.180]  a certain number of level bananas
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.320]  that are different colors for each character to fight
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.300]  the boss of the level.
[27:55.100 --> 27:57.100]  Once I had enough golden bananas
[27:57.100 --> 27:59.160]  which I was able to do in the first two or three levels
[27:59.160 --> 28:01.300]  I just sped run through
[28:01.300 --> 28:03.200]  the game collecting the bananas to fight the
[28:03.200 --> 28:05.200]  bosses. The last three
[28:05.200 --> 28:07.220]  levels I didn't even really play. I was just collecting
[28:07.220 --> 28:09.220]  bananas to get there. And it was
[28:09.220 --> 28:11.160]  just painful. By the end of it, I think
[28:11.160 --> 28:12.640]  80% of the way through
[28:13.200 --> 28:14.840]  I lost game audio again.
[28:15.260 --> 28:16.780]  People were like, where's the audio?
[28:17.300 --> 28:18.900]  I was like, I'm so sorry. I cannot
[28:18.900 --> 28:20.780]  I can't risk this because it is
[28:20.780 --> 28:22.780]  one of the worst games I've played
[28:22.780 --> 28:24.760]  in a really long time. It is painfully
[28:24.760 --> 28:26.660]  bad. It's tedious. It's just terrible.
[28:26.760 --> 28:28.860]  I cannot afford. My soul does not
[28:28.860 --> 28:30.480]  have another reset in me.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.560]  75% of the way through.
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.720]  It was like trying to land a plane
[28:34.720 --> 28:36.840]  that is duct taped together. I was so
[28:36.840 --> 28:39.060]  worried that the first sign of the emulator
[28:39.060 --> 28:40.800]  crashing was going to be that the audio
[28:40.800 --> 28:42.940]  goes out. Then I got stuck on a boss
[28:42.940 --> 28:44.800]  that requires audio cues so that was
[28:44.800 --> 28:47.120]  fun for like 50 minutes.
[28:47.120 --> 28:49.460]  I figured that out eventually.
[28:49.740 --> 28:51.480]  Is that the cannon into the thing?
[28:51.880 --> 28:52.880]  The cardboard cutout?
[28:53.080 --> 28:54.960]  Yeah, it's the cardboard cutout boss. Luckily
[28:54.960 --> 28:56.940]  there's a pattern that is also visual
[28:56.940 --> 28:59.000]  but all of the guides were like, yeah, just listen
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.680]  for this sound. And then I was like,
[29:00.740 --> 29:02.500]  I might be stuck here.
[29:02.820 --> 29:04.540]  I might not be able to do this. I have no audio.
[29:05.220 --> 29:07.040]  I get through that. It is
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.940]  now 5am. Elden Ring
[29:08.940 --> 29:10.580]  is a really popular game right now.
[29:10.940 --> 29:12.900]  I feel like the creator of those
[29:12.900 --> 29:14.900]  Dark Souls games was a big Donkey Kong
[29:14.900 --> 29:16.720]  64 fan because the
[29:16.720 --> 29:18.680]  final boss is such
[29:18.680 --> 29:21.180]  bullshit. It is horrendous.
[29:21.460 --> 29:22.220]  It's a cool
[29:22.760 --> 29:24.840]  backdrop. He's not lying. I wouldn't know because
[29:24.840 --> 29:26.620]  I've never got to that as a kid.
[29:26.780 --> 29:28.980]  And I've never beaten the game. But I've seen videos
[29:28.980 --> 29:30.800]  and it's a
[29:30.800 --> 29:32.980]  five round fight
[29:32.980 --> 29:34.400]  made up of smaller rounds.
[29:34.740 --> 29:36.300]  And if you lose at any point
[29:36.720 --> 29:38.560]  you have to start the entire fight again.
[29:38.860 --> 29:40.620]  You basically have to play as Donkey Kong,
[29:41.120 --> 29:42.780]  Diddy Kong, Tiny Kong, and if you
[29:42.780 --> 29:44.500]  lose then you're all the way back to Donkey Kong.
[29:45.480 --> 29:46.960]  And it is a lot
[29:46.960 --> 29:48.500]  of staying alive to get to that point.
[29:48.900 --> 29:50.740]  So it's five rounds. You have to play as each
[29:50.740 --> 29:52.560]  Kong. If you die at any point
[29:52.560 --> 29:54.740]  there's no checkpoint. You have to go back to
[29:54.740 --> 29:56.700]  the beginning. It probably is like
[29:56.700 --> 29:58.520]  a 10-15 minute boss fight
[29:58.520 --> 30:00.720]  in its entirety. So doing this at
[30:00.720 --> 30:02.500]  like 5am, I'm exhausted.
[30:02.840 --> 30:04.860]  I'm so sick of these fucking Kongs.
[30:05.060 --> 30:06.760]  I'm having to restart over and over. It was so
[30:06.760 --> 30:08.500]  bad Gavin texted me like, this is
[30:08.500 --> 30:10.020]  bad. This is terrible.
[30:11.180 --> 30:11.620]  Um...
[30:11.620 --> 30:13.900]  But I got through it. I beat it Sunday.
[30:14.100 --> 30:16.020]  I think it was like 5am my
[30:16.020 --> 30:18.240]  time. And I won the bet. Undefeated
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.440]  in gaming related bets.
[30:21.500 --> 30:22.380]  Very specific
[30:22.380 --> 30:24.100]  caveat. This is where
[30:24.100 --> 30:25.460]  I was watching it from.
[30:27.960 --> 30:28.840]  That is...
[30:28.840 --> 30:29.460]  Ugh.
[30:29.880 --> 30:31.800]  Were you on your way to England? Yep.
[30:32.080 --> 30:33.520]  I was watching it from my living room.
[30:33.800 --> 30:36.060]  That was me landing at Heathrow and I just whipped
[30:36.060 --> 30:37.480]  it on. Dude, that's awesome.
[30:37.480 --> 30:39.600]  It's the things that break your...
[30:39.600 --> 30:41.760]  So as Gavin said, the reason in the past
[30:41.760 --> 30:43.460]  he never beat it because you have to
[30:43.460 --> 30:45.500]  replay three levels of the original Donkey
[30:45.500 --> 30:47.340]  Kong in a row to get a coin
[30:47.340 --> 30:49.540]  that you need to progress through the story.
[30:49.920 --> 30:51.440]  And it sucks. It's a difficult
[30:51.440 --> 30:53.300]  game to play. You can never finish it.
[30:53.760 --> 30:55.220]  And it took me a while.
[30:55.320 --> 30:57.500]  It took me, I want to say, 80 minutes or so
[30:57.500 --> 30:59.380]  to beat this thing. And it was very
[30:59.380 --> 31:01.440]  stressful. And I'm so excited.
[31:01.560 --> 31:03.720]  I was like, yeah, I fucking did it. Like, finally.
[31:03.800 --> 31:05.460]  Like, this is one of the hurdles to
[31:05.460 --> 31:07.540]  get through. One of the toughest parts of this
[31:07.540 --> 31:09.480]  thing. They make you do it twice. You have to
[31:09.480 --> 31:11.340]  do it twice in a row. I forgot about that.
[31:11.620 --> 31:13.380]  It was so deflating to do it
[31:13.380 --> 31:15.460]  and get essentially nothing for it
[31:15.460 --> 31:17.720]  and then immediately just be like, yeah, do it again.
[31:18.020 --> 31:19.500]  Just do it again. For no
[31:19.500 --> 31:21.140]  reason. Yeah, it's a pretty sadistic game design.
[31:21.260 --> 31:23.440]  It fucking sucks. How long did
[31:23.440 --> 31:24.480]  it take you to do the final boss?
[31:25.020 --> 31:27.400]  The final boss took me probably an
[31:27.400 --> 31:29.420]  hour. How many times do you think you died in the
[31:29.420 --> 31:31.500]  process? Probably
[31:31.500 --> 31:33.480]  like five or six, I'd say.
[31:33.960 --> 31:35.560]  It was... I think
[31:35.560 --> 31:37.420]  in a different... It's the fear of
[31:37.420 --> 31:39.180]  my emulator resetting everything.
[31:39.580 --> 31:41.600]  As I got further into the game, that part
[31:41.600 --> 31:42.780]  of it became more stressful.
[31:43.280 --> 31:45.460]  So it's 5am, I'm stressed, and
[31:45.460 --> 31:46.740]  just trying to get through that was a nightmare.
[31:47.280 --> 31:49.140]  We really tried to steer you away from
[31:49.140 --> 31:51.480]  putting yourself in that situation, but you were adamant
[31:51.480 --> 31:53.480]  about it. Yeah. No, that was...
[31:53.480 --> 31:55.560]  I'm not blaming anybody for that part of it.
[31:55.720 --> 31:57.220]  That's my fuck up. But
[31:57.220 --> 31:58.820]  it was fun to do overall.
[31:59.240 --> 32:01.640]  My only problem with this stream and the previous
[32:01.640 --> 32:03.740]  Halo ones that you guys have done is
[32:03.740 --> 32:05.560]  I love to get in and watch them.
[32:05.860 --> 32:07.760]  And I watched way more of this one than I commented
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.740]  on. Because anytime I get
[32:09.740 --> 32:11.060]  in the chat and try to talk to people,
[32:11.560 --> 32:13.620]  they just accuse me of not being me, and
[32:13.620 --> 32:15.600]  then I have to jump through hoops to try to convince people
[32:15.600 --> 32:17.860]  that I am me, and I just give up. I'm tired
[32:17.860 --> 32:19.580]  of it. I'm just gonna come up with...
[32:19.580 --> 32:21.120]  I'm just gonna go in as a different name.
[32:22.120 --> 32:23.980]  It's like, I can't ever have a conversation
[32:23.980 --> 32:25.680]  without getting yelled at by 30
[32:25.680 --> 32:27.140]  people to stop pretending to be me.
[32:27.440 --> 32:28.920]  I'm the same way. I think...
[32:28.920 --> 32:31.040]  Who was it that banned me from their Twitch
[32:31.040 --> 32:32.000]  chat? It's an imposter.
[32:32.440 --> 32:33.400]  Someone we work with.
[32:35.980 --> 32:36.940]  I don't remember
[32:36.940 --> 32:38.620]  what it was. Maybe it was
[32:39.060 --> 32:40.680]  it was like years ago
[32:40.680 --> 32:42.920]  a Reddit post or something where I was posting
[32:42.920 --> 32:44.620]  as me and they didn't believe it was me.
[32:44.740 --> 32:46.560]  So I had to take a photo of myself holding
[32:46.560 --> 32:48.580]  what day it was. It was this
[32:48.580 --> 32:50.840]  insane verification pro... It felt like
[32:50.840 --> 32:52.000]  a hostage situation.
[32:52.420 --> 32:54.540]  It was absurd. It was just for some
[32:54.540 --> 32:56.480]  nonsense take that had
[32:56.480 --> 32:58.100]  zero relevance to anything.
[32:58.680 --> 32:59.220]  It's just bullshit.
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.820]  Yeah. That was fun.
[33:02.060 --> 33:04.420]  I won the bet. You need to wear
[33:04.420 --> 33:06.580]  64 pieces of clothing on an
[33:06.580 --> 33:08.460]  RT podcast at some point.
[33:08.940 --> 33:10.700]  I get to pick one of those pieces
[33:10.700 --> 33:12.420]  of clothing. I'm going to be...
[33:12.420 --> 33:14.500]  I kind of have an idea right
[33:14.500 --> 33:16.440]  now, but I'll talk to Geoff about it.
[33:16.500 --> 33:17.980]  I'd love to get his opinion on it.
[33:19.020 --> 33:20.600]  This is actually great
[33:20.600 --> 33:22.820]  because I have been on the RT podcast
[33:22.820 --> 33:24.140]  twice this week.
[33:25.200 --> 33:26.060]  Because this week
[33:26.060 --> 33:28.080]  wasn't busy enough, so I said, fuck it, I'll go on some other people's
[33:28.080 --> 33:30.080]  podcasts too. So I had to do
[33:30.080 --> 33:31.440]  the RT podcast twice this week.
[33:31.880 --> 33:33.900]  And both times, because it was different casts,
[33:34.020 --> 33:36.000]  people have said, so Gavin, he doesn't come on
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.960]  the RT podcast anymore? And I got
[33:37.960 --> 33:39.780]  to go, well I know he'll be on at least
[33:39.780 --> 33:42.080]  once more. I can guarantee
[33:42.080 --> 33:42.600]  that.
[33:44.880 --> 33:45.600]  Very accurate.
[33:45.900 --> 33:46.480]  Well, shit.
[33:48.340 --> 33:49.680]  It's going to be a sweaty one.
[33:50.140 --> 33:51.900]  I believe as soon as I won, Gavin
[33:51.900 --> 33:53.860]  immediately texted me, I need to buy some
[33:53.860 --> 33:54.360]  ties.
[33:59.280 --> 33:59.820]  We'll figure
[33:59.820 --> 34:01.820]  that out though. I have an idea. I'd like to hear your thoughts
[34:01.820 --> 34:03.900]  though, Geoff. And at some point
[34:05.080 --> 34:05.440]  Gavin
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.040]  will be wearing 64 pieces of clothing.
[34:08.800 --> 34:09.380]  That's very exciting.
[34:10.300 --> 34:11.600]  Are socks two or one?
[34:12.220 --> 34:13.940]  What do you mean? Like is a pair
[34:13.940 --> 34:16.160]  one or does two socks count as two?
[34:16.440 --> 34:17.760]  No, one sock is a sock.
[34:17.900 --> 34:19.760]  So if you have a pair of socks, it's two socks.
[34:19.760 --> 34:20.420]  Yeah.
[34:21.260 --> 34:23.940]  Wow. Generous. Eric disagrees.
[34:24.420 --> 34:25.220]  I think that's fair.
[34:25.640 --> 34:27.780]  I think I'd be breaking what a sock
[34:27.780 --> 34:29.780]  is. I'd be changing
[34:29.780 --> 34:31.740]  the definition at that point. Eric, why do you have
[34:31.740 --> 34:33.600]  such a problem with that? Because it's a pair
[34:33.600 --> 34:35.760]  of socks. Because you don't wear...
[34:36.600 --> 34:37.140]  Yeah, but they say
[34:37.700 --> 34:39.640]  pair of pants too. Okay.
[34:40.060 --> 34:41.560]  Yeah, like if I put on one
[34:41.560 --> 34:43.220]  glove, am I wearing half of clothes?
[34:43.440 --> 34:45.600]  Right, but you don't typically...
[34:45.600 --> 34:47.620]  You could typically wear one glove. You can wear
[34:47.620 --> 34:49.360]  one glove doing something. Typically two
[34:49.360 --> 34:51.600]  socks are worn. Okay, so a pair of socks
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.500]  is one, but a pair of gloves is two. What if you've
[34:53.500 --> 34:54.620]  only got one leg?
[34:55.180 --> 34:57.540]  For a podcast that's so hung
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.800]  up on regulation, I think it's very strange
[34:59.800 --> 35:01.140]  to draw the line
[35:01.140 --> 35:03.640]  where the two socks
[35:03.640 --> 35:05.620]  are individual things
[35:05.620 --> 35:07.480]  instead of one, especially after we
[35:07.480 --> 35:09.260]  sold socks and we had to sell them
[35:09.260 --> 35:11.260]  together. So I don't understand
[35:11.260 --> 35:13.460]  what the issue... To me, it doesn't make sense. But if you buy a pair
[35:13.460 --> 35:15.160]  of socks, it's two socks.
[35:15.580 --> 35:17.240]  Yeah, Nick says isn't a pair two
[35:17.240 --> 35:18.960]  things. Yeah. Right, yes.
[35:19.080 --> 35:21.300]  But again, typically
[35:21.300 --> 35:23.220]  when things are regulation worn,
[35:23.440 --> 35:25.040]  it's two socks or one item.
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.560]  I mean...
[35:28.560 --> 35:31.400]  I have no dog
[35:31.400 --> 35:33.220]  in this fight. I have no problem
[35:33.220 --> 35:34.280]  acquiescing to this.
[35:34.700 --> 35:37.140]  What do I care? I don't have to wear all the things.
[35:37.220 --> 35:39.360]  It's fine. I'm just saying that that's how it feels to me.
[35:39.540 --> 35:41.060]  I feel like I'm talking to me.
[35:41.480 --> 35:43.300]  Like this is the reverse. Like I'm on the
[35:43.300 --> 35:45.080]  other side of one of these things.
[35:45.280 --> 35:47.200]  I understand what you're saying,
[35:47.320 --> 35:49.420]  but I don't know why. Go ahead, Geoff.
[35:50.420 --> 35:50.800]  Eric's
[35:51.300 --> 35:52.620]  argument is persuasive.
[35:53.140 --> 35:54.480]  I think I might be on Eric's side now.
[35:56.280 --> 35:57.300]  How often are you
[35:57.300 --> 35:59.220]  walking around with one sock? That's
[35:59.220 --> 36:01.220]  my thing. I don't think that matters.
[36:01.440 --> 36:03.320]  You can't go up to someone and say, hey, throw me
[36:03.320 --> 36:04.100]  that socks.
[36:08.900 --> 36:11.120]  What can you say, Gavin? What would be the
[36:11.120 --> 36:12.980]  appropriate... Have you ever asked anyone
[36:12.980 --> 36:15.000]  socks plural or that socks singular?
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.120]  I feel like no matter what word
[36:17.120 --> 36:18.920]  you use, that's still a weird sentence
[36:18.920 --> 36:19.880]  to say to someone.
[36:20.760 --> 36:23.080]  You're getting hung up on the thing that
[36:23.080 --> 36:25.040]  you're not wearing. I am hung
[36:25.040 --> 36:26.600]  up on the thing that you are wearing.
[36:26.780 --> 36:28.940]  Where it is two socks are typically counted
[36:28.940 --> 36:30.080]  like they're one item.
[36:30.840 --> 36:32.980]  A pair of socks is like what? You don't
[36:32.980 --> 36:35.160]  typically wear one sock. That's what
[36:35.160 --> 36:36.980]  I'm saying. Again, they can be
[36:36.980 --> 36:38.980]  individual. One sock can be one
[36:38.980 --> 36:40.900]  sock. I say go for it.
[36:41.160 --> 36:43.180]  I'm saying that in terms
[36:43.180 --> 36:45.140]  of an outfit, it's strange to me.
[36:45.460 --> 36:47.060]  I think you're completely right. But I think
[36:47.060 --> 36:49.060]  by definition, if somebody was
[36:50.320 --> 36:50.800]  like...
[36:50.800 --> 36:53.120]  Are you agreeing with me
[36:53.120 --> 36:55.140]  and then telling me...
[36:55.140 --> 36:57.420]  No. I'm agreeing with
[36:57.420 --> 36:59.200]  the point you're saying, but I'm disagreeing
[36:59.200 --> 37:00.580]  with its use in this context.
[37:01.280 --> 37:02.740]  I'm agreeing with what you're saying in the sense of
[37:02.740 --> 37:05.120]  if someone buys...
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.120]  A sock is like two socks is sold
[37:07.120 --> 37:08.960]  as an individual item. It's one.
[37:09.340 --> 37:11.200]  But in the context of if Gavin were to
[37:11.200 --> 37:13.320]  put one sock on, we wouldn't
[37:13.320 --> 37:15.000]  consider that a half an item.
[37:15.780 --> 37:17.040]  I'll say this, Andrew.
[37:17.180 --> 37:19.140]  That was spoken like a true internet
[37:19.140 --> 37:20.400]  lawyer. Yeah?
[37:21.600 --> 37:23.080]  Yeah. Are you still certified
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.080]  up on the website? Oh, I'm still getting
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.900]  updates all the time for hired judge.
[37:27.040 --> 37:27.980]  I get like two a week.
[37:28.640 --> 37:30.020]  That's such a throwback.
[37:30.540 --> 37:32.100]  That was over a year ago.
[37:33.440 --> 37:34.620]  It's really easy to get in.
[37:34.620 --> 37:36.060]  Deep lore, Gavin. Deep lore.
[37:36.180 --> 37:38.660]  I think Eric is more
[37:38.660 --> 37:40.520]  like Andrew than he
[37:40.520 --> 37:41.840]  was when we started F*** Face.
[37:42.200 --> 37:43.740]  I think Andrew is rubbed off on him.
[37:43.960 --> 37:45.920]  I definitely think that there's...
[37:45.920 --> 37:48.280]  I think that I lean into it in this show
[37:48.280 --> 37:50.200]  because regulation is so
[37:50.200 --> 37:52.120]  important. For this show...
[37:52.120 --> 37:53.960]  For Face Jam or any other show,
[37:54.140 --> 37:55.680]  who cares? For this show,
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.180]  regulation is apparently the most important
[37:58.180 --> 37:59.980]  thing in the fucking world.
[38:00.300 --> 38:02.120]  So I'm just trying to figure out
[38:02.120 --> 38:03.440]  what the regulation sock is.
[38:03.880 --> 38:05.860]  You know what, Eric? I agree with you.
[38:06.060 --> 38:08.180]  I think that's correct. I think regulation is the most important
[38:08.180 --> 38:09.420]  thing in this show.
[38:09.740 --> 38:11.300]  I think regulation is a sock.
[38:11.900 --> 38:14.020]  Eric, would you be able to arrange me
[38:14.020 --> 38:16.000]  a fan for whenever we do that podcast?
[38:16.360 --> 38:16.920]  Do you want
[38:18.060 --> 38:20.080]  somebody to come and cheer you on or do you want
[38:20.080 --> 38:21.220]  something to blow air at you?
[38:21.660 --> 38:22.740]  Probably the air thing.
[38:24.940 --> 38:25.580]  I'll get you
[38:25.980 --> 38:27.820]  one of those little ones. You know, like the little fan
[38:27.820 --> 38:29.820]  that you hold and you sip a drink
[38:29.820 --> 38:30.660]  Like a hand fan?
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.880]  Yeah, like a AAA battery type fan.
[38:34.420 --> 38:35.860]  Oh, you're talking about like a paper
[38:35.860 --> 38:36.280]  fan.
[38:39.780 --> 38:41.880]  I think socks count. I don't think
[38:41.880 --> 38:43.380]  something... I think the clothing
[38:43.380 --> 38:45.940]  has to be surface level.
[38:46.320 --> 38:47.700]  Like it has to appear.
[38:48.140 --> 38:49.820]  Like you couldn't wear like 20
[38:49.820 --> 38:50.780]  pairs of underwear.
[38:52.100 --> 38:53.520]  What if you wore them over your pants?
[38:53.960 --> 38:55.800]  Then that's allowed. As long as it's
[38:55.800 --> 38:57.680]  a building up and not down.
[38:58.080 --> 38:59.600]  I can't wear 20 underwear?
[39:00.440 --> 39:01.920]  Well, as long as they're in front
[39:01.920 --> 39:03.620]  of the pants, I think is the regulation.
[39:03.660 --> 39:05.500]  Well, does the initial pair of underwear
[39:05.500 --> 39:07.260]  The initial pair of underwear counts though, right?
[39:07.460 --> 39:09.900]  Like underwear count, pants
[39:09.900 --> 39:11.620]  count, and then anything over pants
[39:11.620 --> 39:12.480]  counts. Okay, cool.
[39:13.380 --> 39:15.440]  But you can't go underwear, underwear, underwear,
[39:15.580 --> 39:17.700]  pants, Gavin. Which maybe you normally do
[39:17.700 --> 39:19.160]  and if you do, I would
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.760]  understand if I had the same body issues you do.
[39:22.160 --> 39:23.700]  But it won't
[39:23.700 --> 39:25.700]  count in this sentence. Yeah, I don't think I've done that since
[39:25.700 --> 39:27.200]  I had food poisoning that one time.
[39:30.460 --> 39:31.720]  God, I had food poisoning!
[39:32.140 --> 39:33.820]  Do they make gloves for individual fingers?
[39:35.320 --> 39:35.880]  Why would
[39:35.880 --> 39:37.840]  they make that? Unless it's
[39:37.840 --> 39:39.600]  like one of those shitty like
[39:39.600 --> 39:41.480]  oh, look at how wacky I am. I got
[39:41.480 --> 39:43.620]  finger gloves. You know what, if you start
[39:43.620 --> 39:45.700]  talking individual finger gloves, I'm definitely
[39:45.700 --> 39:46.800]  going over to Eric's side.
[39:47.520 --> 39:49.400]  Cut that shit off. Look,
[39:49.500 --> 39:51.720]  it's a bet against Andrew. I have to loophole this
[39:51.720 --> 39:53.600]  somehow. I've got to do what he
[39:53.600 --> 39:55.040]  would do. That's true.
[39:56.400 --> 39:56.820]  64
[39:57.940 --> 39:59.300]  paper crowns from Christmas
[39:59.300 --> 39:59.700]  crackers.
[40:01.040 --> 40:03.200]  You couldn't fit 64 crowns on your head.
[40:04.360 --> 40:05.380]  Seems like a challenge.
[40:06.420 --> 40:07.680]  I couldn't fit one
[40:07.680 --> 40:09.520]  on my head. It's a nightmare. The Christmas
[40:09.520 --> 40:11.620]  cracker crown head is
[40:11.620 --> 40:12.580]  way too big for that.
[40:15.300 --> 40:17.580]  I'm going to text you the thing that
[40:17.580 --> 40:19.460]  I was thinking of, Geoff, and I'll just get your immediate
[40:19.460 --> 40:20.740]  live reaction on the podcast.
[40:20.740 --> 40:22.800]  Well, I guess we're recording too,
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.980]  so next week or whenever we record
[40:24.980 --> 40:27.040]  again, not next episode,
[40:28.500 --> 40:28.900]  we'll
[40:28.900 --> 40:30.800]  lock it in. I'll find something that we can
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.820]  definitively share, but this is sort of where my head's at.
[40:33.400 --> 40:34.860]  Just the top part of
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.640]  what I just sent you. My initial thought.
[40:38.340 --> 40:38.880]  Pulling it up
[40:38.880 --> 40:40.800]  right now. And I guess you should
[40:40.800 --> 40:42.100]  probably see... Oh, yeah!
[40:43.100 --> 40:44.680]  Yes! Okay, excellent, excellent,
[40:44.780 --> 40:46.720]  excellent, excellent. I'm glad you're going
[40:46.720 --> 40:48.500]  in this direction. Oh, man.
[40:48.500 --> 40:49.900]  That's not good for me.
[40:50.040 --> 40:52.340]  I had that thought at some point,
[40:52.620 --> 40:54.500]  and yeah, you're brilliant. This is
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.800]  great. It's really, really great.
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.420]  Fantastic. When do I
[40:58.420 --> 40:58.900]  find out?
[41:00.100 --> 41:01.980]  Ten minutes before the podcast, probably.
[41:03.100 --> 41:04.400]  Next week, we'll do it.
[41:04.820 --> 41:06.460]  If we want to talk about deep lore,
[41:07.260 --> 41:08.500]  I have an update. I had
[41:08.500 --> 41:10.240]  something happen in my life that connects
[41:10.240 --> 41:12.380]  all the way back to the
[41:12.380 --> 41:14.480]  first episode of this podcast.
[41:15.380 --> 41:16.240]  Real Reach.
[41:16.240 --> 41:17.480]  I got my haircut.
[41:18.540 --> 41:19.020]  Congratulations!
[41:19.920 --> 41:22.200]  I haven't got my haircut since December of
[41:22.200 --> 41:24.260]  2019. I got my haircut.
[41:24.560 --> 41:26.220]  It was a process. Wait, so this whole time
[41:26.220 --> 41:28.180]  you've had really long hair? Yeah.
[41:28.320 --> 41:30.320]  It's gotten progressively longer with this show.
[41:30.440 --> 41:32.320]  I haven't had a single haircut because I was waiting.
[41:32.700 --> 41:33.160]  Are you serious? Yeah.
[41:33.760 --> 41:35.340]  Are there photos? No.
[41:35.740 --> 41:36.520]  No photos.
[41:37.560 --> 41:40.300]  That means I haven't seen you
[41:40.300 --> 41:41.720]  since we started F*** Face.
[41:41.940 --> 41:42.820]  Oh, way before then.
[41:42.820 --> 41:45.040]  Yeah, I know. I know in real life.
[41:45.100 --> 41:46.680]  But I haven't even seen you
[41:46.680 --> 41:48.160]  on video or on a picture
[41:48.800 --> 41:50.880]  the entire time we've had this podcast.
[41:51.200 --> 41:52.360]  My hair was like
[41:52.360 --> 41:54.180]  between my shoulder blades. It was long.
[41:54.220 --> 41:57.000]  I've been picturing you all wrong this whole time.
[41:57.160 --> 41:58.660]  My hair got to...
[41:58.660 --> 42:00.500]  The final straw was us having
[42:00.500 --> 42:02.640]  issues where I'd go to like bring
[42:02.640 --> 42:04.760]  my neck up, like I'd go to lift my head
[42:04.760 --> 42:06.560]  and I wouldn't realize my hair was trapped
[42:06.560 --> 42:08.520]  behind my back and I'd whip my head back
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.820]  into the pillow. I was giving myself whiplash.
[42:10.820 --> 42:12.920]  I was like, I'm f***ing... I hate everything
[42:12.920 --> 42:14.500]  about this. I'm done.
[42:14.620 --> 42:17.000]  But as we stated in the
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.500]  first episode, my guy was in
[42:18.500 --> 42:20.820]  a retirement home, which has been
[42:20.820 --> 42:22.340]  very difficult to get into
[42:22.820 --> 42:25.060]  during the pandemic. It's been a very restrictive
[42:25.060 --> 42:27.040]  part. But unfortunately for me,
[42:27.560 --> 42:28.380]  he retired.
[42:28.600 --> 42:30.000]  So I had to get a new guy.
[42:30.660 --> 42:32.760]  Did he go out to a farm out west with lots of space
[42:32.760 --> 42:34.240]  to run around in? He did.
[42:34.720 --> 42:36.660]  I think he actually just moved upstairs.
[42:36.780 --> 42:38.760]  I think since he was already there, he just took a
[42:38.760 --> 42:40.800]  place in the building.
[42:41.300 --> 42:42.620]  But I got my haircut
[42:42.620 --> 42:45.020]  and I went completely the other way.
[42:45.140 --> 42:47.100]  I went from a retirement home to a place
[42:47.100 --> 42:48.920]  that has graffiti art on the walls and
[42:48.920 --> 42:50.680]  skateboards and the vibe
[42:50.680 --> 42:52.660]  couldn't be further from the other thing.
[42:53.100 --> 42:54.960]  It was great. I think the vibe of
[42:54.960 --> 42:57.080]  the retirement home is closer to your personal
[42:57.080 --> 42:58.400]  vibe. You think so?
[43:00.920 --> 43:02.940]  All the people magazines and
[43:02.940 --> 43:04.820]  royalty shit on the thing.
[43:05.400 --> 43:06.320]  People cooking
[43:07.040 --> 43:08.160]  noodles in their kettles.
[43:12.760 --> 43:14.200]  So I had that happen.
[43:14.560 --> 43:16.220]  And it feels great to have short hair.
[43:16.700 --> 43:18.240]  It's blown my mind. I really
[43:18.240 --> 43:20.340]  can't believe that every time I've been listening to you
[43:20.340 --> 43:21.940]  on F*** Face, you've had long hair.
[43:22.240 --> 43:23.780]  It's blown my mind.
[43:23.980 --> 43:26.480]  Not only has he had long hair, I bet he's had luscious locks.
[43:26.900 --> 43:28.360]  I bet he's like swung
[43:28.360 --> 43:30.400]  it out of his eyes suggestively a few times
[43:30.400 --> 43:31.480]  when he laughed in the podcast.
[43:31.740 --> 43:32.780]  Is it really curly?
[43:33.420 --> 43:34.920]  It was sort of curly.
[43:35.040 --> 43:37.260]  It was very long and annoying.
[43:37.440 --> 43:38.580]  I hated looking down.
[43:39.040 --> 43:40.600]  It made looking down an annoyance.
[43:40.900 --> 43:41.380]  It was terrible.
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.560]  I did it as well for a bit.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.020]  I didn't wait an extra year like you did.
[43:46.700 --> 43:48.700]  It's not good. So I have a new guy.
[43:48.840 --> 43:50.860]  I bet you look like Glenn Danzig with long hair.
[43:52.760 --> 43:53.840]  I don't know why.
[43:54.700 --> 43:55.120]  Yeah.
[43:56.560 --> 43:57.340]  How's your new guy?
[43:58.080 --> 44:00.780]  Great, but on the way...
[44:01.240 --> 44:02.600]  I was like walking around
[44:02.600 --> 44:03.620]  because I got there too early.
[44:03.760 --> 44:05.140]  So I was like, I'm just going to kill some time.
[44:05.240 --> 44:06.600]  So I was looking at the different stores
[44:07.020 --> 44:09.800]  and I walked past this sign for this bagel place
[44:09.800 --> 44:11.180]  called My Hubby's Bagels.
[44:11.640 --> 44:12.880]  It had like a cute little logo.
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.780]  And I was like, oh, nice, like a local
[44:14.780 --> 44:16.500]  and new bagel place going in.
[44:16.560 --> 44:17.280]  This could be great.
[44:17.780 --> 44:18.940]  I thought it seemed really cute.
[44:19.180 --> 44:20.980]  I was excited about the bagel place.
[44:21.540 --> 44:22.420]  Geoff just posted.
[44:23.520 --> 44:25.240]  That actually isn't all that far off.
[44:25.240 --> 44:27.480]  You're actually pretty accurate.
[44:28.040 --> 44:28.500]  You're right.
[44:28.780 --> 44:30.460]  It did look very much like that.
[44:31.240 --> 44:32.380]  That's quite the forehead.
[44:32.980 --> 44:33.620]  It is.
[44:34.220 --> 44:35.680]  That's a fantastic forehead.
[44:36.340 --> 44:38.540]  But I was walking around.
[44:38.600 --> 44:40.360]  I found that My Hubby's Bagel place
[44:41.180 --> 44:42.420]  and it seemed really cute.
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.000]  And so when I came home,
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.080]  I was looking at it on Twitter or whatever
[44:46.080 --> 44:47.140]  and I was like, oh, that's cool.
[44:48.140 --> 44:49.920]  I would like updates on this place
[44:49.920 --> 44:51.160]  because I like to get bagels from them
[44:51.160 --> 44:51.820]  whenever they open.
[44:51.900 --> 44:53.560]  It seems like a sweet local place.
[44:53.620 --> 44:54.460]  So I followed them.
[44:54.940 --> 44:56.620]  I didn't think much of it.
[44:56.620 --> 45:00.240]  I told some of my friends about it.
[45:00.260 --> 45:01.700]  I was like, ah, I can count on this cute bagel place.
[45:02.180 --> 45:04.100]  And then three or four days passed
[45:04.640 --> 45:06.440]  and somebody said to me,
[45:06.480 --> 45:08.620]  oh, so you followed the bagel place on Twitter.
[45:09.460 --> 45:11.220]  I was like, what? That's a weird...
[45:11.220 --> 45:12.200]  Yeah, I did.
[45:12.280 --> 45:15.380]  But why are you bringing this up three days later?
[45:16.720 --> 45:17.800]  What ended up happening
[45:18.560 --> 45:19.920]  was I accidentally
[45:19.920 --> 45:22.080]  followed the bagel place
[45:22.080 --> 45:23.860]  on the F*** FacePod Twitter account.
[45:26.020 --> 45:27.320]  I didn't know
[45:27.320 --> 45:29.180]  I didn't know I signed in as that.
[45:29.260 --> 45:30.960]  Because Twitter is great. You can have multiple accounts.
[45:31.040 --> 45:32.180]  You can just swap between the two.
[45:32.640 --> 45:35.620]  I was signed in on the F*** FacePod Twitter account
[45:35.620 --> 45:37.140]  and somebody commented
[45:37.140 --> 45:38.260]  to the Twitter account,
[45:38.620 --> 45:40.600]  why do you follow six people
[45:40.600 --> 45:43.060]  and one of them is my hubby's bagels?
[45:45.740 --> 45:46.960]  So if you look
[45:46.960 --> 45:49.200]  if you look at our Twitter account
[45:49.200 --> 45:50.920]  it's like, it's myself,
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.120]  Eric, Geoff,
[45:53.400 --> 45:54.640]  Gavin, like
[45:54.640 --> 45:57.020]  the Rooster Teeth store, maybe
[45:57.020 --> 45:58.680]  it's like one other, it's a company thing.
[45:58.920 --> 46:00.720]  And then just my hubby's bagels.
[46:02.160 --> 46:02.800]  They have
[46:02.800 --> 46:04.840]  23 followers and one of them is
[46:04.840 --> 46:05.720]  F*** FacePod.
[46:06.140 --> 46:06.700]  Forever.
[46:08.500 --> 46:09.340]  I can't take it off.
[46:10.140 --> 46:12.200]  The reply was to the person,
[46:12.600 --> 46:14.660]  you like what you like, as to why we follow
[46:14.660 --> 46:15.800]  my hubby's bagels.
[46:18.120 --> 46:19.000]  That's amazing.
[46:19.140 --> 46:19.960]  Do they sell t-shirts?
[46:21.080 --> 46:22.420]  They're not even open yet.
[46:22.900 --> 46:24.780]  I didn't think
[46:24.780 --> 46:26.240]  that ever worked, like putting your
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.260]  Twitter handle on your store.
[46:28.900 --> 46:30.280]  I'm thinking, who actually ever
[46:30.280 --> 46:32.320]  goes and follows those? But you do.
[46:32.600 --> 46:33.580]  You're one of those people.
[46:34.300 --> 46:36.000]  I would like to know when they open.
[46:36.680 --> 46:37.760]  It just seemed convenient.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.600]  I'm not going to be in that area all that often.
[46:40.880 --> 46:42.900]  So I was like, this will be great.
[46:42.900 --> 46:44.340]  I'll be able to check this out.
[46:44.480 --> 46:47.220]  You were hoping for a future of haircuts and bagels.
[46:47.420 --> 46:49.000]  Yeah, like a one-two.
[46:49.360 --> 46:51.140]  Like a one-two, get some bagels
[46:51.140 --> 46:52.680]  going, get my haircut.
[46:53.200 --> 46:54.300]  But it was just so funny.
[46:54.440 --> 46:56.720]  I felt so dumb that I followed.
[46:56.960 --> 46:58.620]  And I can't wait for their perspective.
[46:58.760 --> 47:00.880]  They haven't followed back, to my knowledge.
[47:02.640 --> 47:03.680]  But we can hope.
[47:04.140 --> 47:05.800]  That's such an exclusive slot.
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.160]  I just posted their website. Bagels look good.
[47:11.160 --> 47:13.000]  They're going to be more info posted soon.
[47:13.220 --> 47:13.400]  Yeah.
[47:14.380 --> 47:16.900]  They look great. They just seem like a cute
[47:16.900 --> 47:17.880]  gay couple.
[47:18.220 --> 47:19.740]  It's great.
[47:20.200 --> 47:22.900]  What if we're a bagel podcast now?
[47:23.320 --> 47:25.060]  I'm absolutely a bagel guy.
[47:25.420 --> 47:26.520]  So it would make sense, I feel.
[47:26.820 --> 47:29.140]  This is what we should do. As soon as we come to
[47:29.140 --> 47:31.120]  see you, Andrew, maybe that's when we'll have our first
[47:31.120 --> 47:31.500]  breakfast.
[47:32.500 --> 47:34.300]  We're going to buy all these bagels.
[47:34.820 --> 47:36.920]  Yeah, that's a great idea. Before we go crabbing,
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.160]  we'll eat bagels. I want an everything bagel.
[47:39.160 --> 47:41.380]  I think those are raisins, Eric.
[47:41.580 --> 47:43.040]  That is too many raisins.
[47:43.160 --> 47:44.820]  Why would you have so many raisins with a
[47:45.400 --> 47:46.140]  baked good?
[47:47.180 --> 47:48.500]  There's a raisin bagel there.
[47:48.640 --> 47:49.800]  I think it's a raisin bagel.
[47:51.440 --> 47:52.660]  It's supposed to be like,
[47:52.820 --> 47:53.780]  look at these raisins.
[47:54.500 --> 47:56.000]  These are the ingredients, not like
[47:56.940 --> 47:57.700]  150 raisins.
[47:58.300 --> 48:00.500]  It's more like fresh ingredients, right?
[48:00.800 --> 48:02.520]  I assume so. I think they're trying to be like,
[48:02.560 --> 48:04.380]  this is the five. These are the fresh raisins.
[48:04.700 --> 48:06.660]  They also put
[48:06.660 --> 48:07.880]  the cream cheese.
[48:08.240 --> 48:09.780]  First off, fuck cream cheese, right?
[48:10.020 --> 48:12.280]  They put the cream cheese in a glass
[48:12.280 --> 48:14.020]  container. Like, who the fuck does that?
[48:14.100 --> 48:16.480]  Also, fuck glass. But that's a whole conversation
[48:16.480 --> 48:17.780]  for later. Fuck glass.
[48:18.380 --> 48:19.600]  Fuck glass. That'll be next episode.
[48:19.860 --> 48:20.980]  Fuck glass.
[48:21.520 --> 48:24.040]  It's a fucking big pile of cinnamon.
[48:25.060 --> 48:26.400]  Yeah, nobody's going to eat that much
[48:26.400 --> 48:28.140]  cinnamon unless they're doing a TikTok challenge.
[48:28.780 --> 48:30.500]  So you have a problem with glass next episode?
[48:30.640 --> 48:31.480]  Man, fuck glass.
[48:31.980 --> 48:34.340]  I don't want to talk about this. We got too much other stuff to talk about.
[48:35.780 --> 48:36.320]  Fucking
[48:36.320 --> 48:36.740]  glass.
[48:37.840 --> 48:39.560]  I'm just sick of it.
[48:41.340 --> 48:42.140]  How was
[48:42.140 --> 48:44.540]  Europe, Gavin? How was that?
[48:44.660 --> 48:46.060]  It was good. Good times.
[48:46.320 --> 48:48.220]  Source of family. When I
[48:48.220 --> 48:49.700]  got back, I actually went to
[48:50.700 --> 48:51.700]  Tumble 22.
[48:52.280 --> 48:53.360]  Nice little chicken place.
[48:54.100 --> 48:55.940]  It's Nashville hot chicken,
[48:56.300 --> 48:57.580]  if you're wondering. It's delicious.
[48:58.520 --> 49:00.080]  Yeah, and the waitress there
[49:00.080 --> 49:02.280]  was... she mentioned
[49:02.280 --> 49:04.160]  that she was listening to F*** Face.
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.340]  And I realized, my favorite thing in the world
[49:06.340 --> 49:08.320]  is when someone who is currently
[49:08.320 --> 49:10.200]  working has to say that they
[49:10.200 --> 49:12.280]  like a podcast called F*** Face.
[49:12.320 --> 49:14.400]  It just sounds so funny and like in a professional
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.500]  environment, like, oh, can I get these out of your way?
[49:16.580 --> 49:18.120]  Do you want this thing? It's like, by the way,
[49:18.160 --> 49:19.540]  really love F*** Face.
[49:20.140 --> 49:21.520]  Let people around listen.
[49:22.360 --> 49:24.200]  It's so good. And it
[49:24.200 --> 49:26.020]  wasn't like a, just a generic like,
[49:26.100 --> 49:28.280]  oh, it's a good podcast. It was, she was
[49:28.280 --> 49:30.040]  literally like right up to date. She was
[49:30.040 --> 49:32.000]  complaining about how terrible your
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.100]  list was, Andrew, of 20,000 things.
[49:34.300 --> 49:36.100]  And I was like, damn, that's like
[49:36.100 --> 49:37.760]  the most recent one to come out.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  She's really up to date. She told Gavin
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.740]  he salad creamed the list.
[49:45.680 --> 49:48.020]  Yeah, and then we were talking, Geoff and I were talking about how it's so
[49:48.020 --> 49:50.080]  fun that we have like our own little language
[49:50.080 --> 49:51.500]  almost amongst the
[49:52.140 --> 49:53.600]  listeners. Yeah, like the,
[49:54.540 --> 49:55.940]  I would love to see like a F*** Face
[49:55.940 --> 49:57.520]  dictionary with all the F*** Face verbs.
[49:58.300 --> 49:59.220]  Like F*** Face.
[50:01.260 --> 50:01.720]  Salad
[50:01.720 --> 50:02.080]  cream.
[50:04.180 --> 50:05.340]  Oh, I wonder,
[50:05.520 --> 50:07.480]  I wonder what bagel will be a verb for
[50:07.480 --> 50:09.440]  someday. Post the photos in the chat
[50:09.440 --> 50:11.420]  of, they have 23 followers and us
[50:11.420 --> 50:13.220]  and the second one is what, who F*** Face
[50:13.220 --> 50:13.600]  followed.
[50:17.760 --> 50:19.000]  Followed by F*** Face.
[50:24.280 --> 50:25.460]  Oh, we've got to
[50:25.460 --> 50:27.520]  go there. We've got to add that to the list
[50:27.520 --> 50:29.440]  of the immensely long list of things
[50:29.440 --> 50:31.420]  we've got to do. We've got that to
[50:31.420 --> 50:33.400]  go there. Oh my God.
[50:33.900 --> 50:35.540]  We're going to have to spend more than a week
[50:35.540 --> 50:35.780]  there.
[50:38.320 --> 50:39.620]  I feel like, Andrew,
[50:40.040 --> 50:41.780]  you're secretly dreading
[50:41.780 --> 50:43.820]  us eventually showing up
[50:43.820 --> 50:45.440]  in your hometown. I think
[50:45.440 --> 50:47.480]  you're going to hate it. Do you, like, why do you
[50:47.480 --> 50:49.440]  think that? Do you think I think that or do you think
[50:49.440 --> 50:51.400]  I will end up hating it? No, I don't think,
[50:51.480 --> 50:53.540]  I don't think you should hate it. I just think you're
[50:53.540 --> 50:55.540]  dreading that moment. I get the same
[50:55.540 --> 50:57.460]  when we're actually nearby you. Really?
[50:57.680 --> 50:59.600]  No, it's not. It's the opposite because I
[50:59.600 --> 51:01.560]  feel I'm going to get validated first of all
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.700]  about my door situation. That'll be the first
[51:03.700 --> 51:05.600]  thing. I feel it's
[51:05.600 --> 51:07.580]  going to be a very validating trip for me because
[51:07.580 --> 51:09.060]  I think you're going to be on board with that.
[51:09.560 --> 51:11.620]  Then you're going to actually go into my place and realize
[51:11.620 --> 51:13.560]  the f***ing Hall of Mirrors that I live in
[51:13.560 --> 51:15.480]  and how absurd that I'm just
[51:15.480 --> 51:16.820]  explaining it correctly.
[51:17.500 --> 51:19.520]  None of this. I feel like it's going to
[51:19.520 --> 51:21.800]  be a real eye-opening trip for the two of you
[51:21.800 --> 51:22.760]  and then we can go get bagels.
[51:23.580 --> 51:24.980]  I think it's going to be a great time.
[51:25.940 --> 51:28.020]  I'm so excited for what eventually happens.
[51:29.220 --> 51:29.940]  It's uh...
[51:29.940 --> 51:31.820]  Yeah, I think we're going to... I appreciate
[51:31.820 --> 51:33.860]  just thinking we need a week. I don't know what we're going to do.
[51:33.940 --> 51:35.720]  We're going crabbing. Do you have any
[51:35.720 --> 51:37.840]  plans? Well, we might do
[51:37.840 --> 51:39.780]  a bathtub race depending on what time
[51:39.780 --> 51:41.800]  of year we go up there. Although I refuse to step
[51:41.800 --> 51:43.160]  foot in Canada in June.
[51:43.560 --> 51:44.460]  That's not going to happen.
[51:47.880 --> 51:49.360]  Are there any museums
[51:49.860 --> 51:50.940]  on your island?
[51:51.320 --> 51:52.980]  Yeah, there's a museum.
[51:53.280 --> 51:55.140]  There is a museum. There's a few museums.
[51:55.220 --> 51:57.180]  Check out the museum. Maybe go to...
[51:57.180 --> 51:58.420]  What about the Nanaimo Bar?
[51:59.060 --> 52:01.280]  We can do... we can play tennis.
[52:02.240 --> 52:03.660]  You don't know the Nanaimo Bar, Gavin?
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.100]  What's the Nanaimo Bar?
[52:05.440 --> 52:07.400]  It's like the only thing that the place I
[52:07.400 --> 52:09.320]  live in is known for.
[52:09.420 --> 52:11.440]  It's a dessert. It's called the Nanaimo
[52:11.440 --> 52:13.280]  Bar. It's a pastry
[52:13.920 --> 52:15.480]  type... you don't bake
[52:15.480 --> 52:17.200]  it, I don't think, is what makes it unique.
[52:17.200 --> 52:18.540]  It's like chocolate.
[52:19.220 --> 52:21.360]  Well, it's like a chocolate brownie
[52:21.360 --> 52:23.320]  type thing. It's like chocolate with
[52:23.320 --> 52:24.400]  a layer of icing.
[52:25.840 --> 52:27.240]  Oh, I'm into it.
[52:27.360 --> 52:29.240]  We'll get three of them. Yeah, one of
[52:29.240 --> 52:30.880]  those. There's coconut. The traditional
[52:30.880 --> 52:33.100]  recipe is walnuts in the bottom, but
[52:33.100 --> 52:34.960]  people also use coconut as a replacement.
[52:35.460 --> 52:36.840]  Oh, I feel like I've had that before.
[52:36.980 --> 52:39.080]  Yeah, I'm sure you have. It's the Nanaimo Bar.
[52:39.440 --> 52:41.020]  It's all we have. We have that
[52:41.020 --> 52:41.980]  and bathtub racing.
[52:43.760 --> 52:45.340]  And Andrew Payton.
[52:45.340 --> 52:47.320]  And a Vancouver child kicker.
[52:47.440 --> 52:49.320]  That's innate. Well, that's
[52:49.320 --> 52:51.460]  alleged. You know, we don't know who that is.
[52:51.580 --> 52:52.620]  We don't know where that belongs.
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.440]  Vancouver, technically, not even Nanaimo.
[52:55.620 --> 52:56.720]  It's a different place.
[52:57.120 --> 52:58.320]  Can't take credit on that.
[52:59.220 --> 52:59.920]  Oh, that does look yummy.
[53:00.840 --> 53:02.900]  They're okay. I don't love them.
[53:04.640 --> 53:07.180]  Is there anything else we can do? What does Nanaimo
[53:07.180 --> 53:09.080]  have to offer? We can play tennis.
[53:09.320 --> 53:11.280]  We can do the ladder drill.
[53:11.500 --> 53:13.260]  We have a curling rink. You probably don't
[53:13.260 --> 53:15.040]  have one of those. We'll go curling.
[53:15.320 --> 53:17.020]  I mean, isn't that just an ice rink, though?
[53:17.440 --> 53:19.440]  Is that like a separate, specific rink?
[53:20.100 --> 53:21.300]  Yeah, it's a different rink.
[53:21.520 --> 53:23.320]  You can't just ice skate on the
[53:23.320 --> 53:25.140]  curling rink. So we have to do
[53:25.140 --> 53:27.200]  teams, then? Yeah. So who's on
[53:27.200 --> 53:27.640]  who's team?
[53:29.380 --> 53:31.200]  Not it. I assume Eric
[53:31.200 --> 53:32.940]  and Nick are also coming. Not yet who.
[53:43.700 --> 53:44.280]  Is that you?
[53:44.340 --> 53:45.260]  You don't want to be on my team?
[53:50.500 --> 53:51.180]  I need to
[53:51.180 --> 53:53.100]  review the video before I make any
[53:53.100 --> 53:55.100]  draft picks. I need to see the shovel work done
[53:55.100 --> 53:56.820]  by both of you to determine who I think
[53:56.820 --> 53:58.880]  would be the best on the field. Do you think shoveling
[53:58.880 --> 54:00.940]  skills translate to curling? I think
[54:00.940 --> 54:02.920]  because the broom. You got the person on the broom
[54:02.920 --> 54:05.040]  in the front. You don't stab
[54:05.040 --> 54:06.160]  the ice with the broom.
[54:06.900 --> 54:08.720]  Mechanically, they're very similar motions.
[54:09.200 --> 54:10.340]  What are you talking about? I'll say this
[54:10.340 --> 54:13.000]  of Gavin's shoveling skills, Andrew, if it
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.420]  helps. That video
[54:14.940 --> 54:16.900]  we had about an hour's worth of footage,
[54:17.020 --> 54:18.980]  raw footage. Gavin put all of
[54:18.980 --> 54:21.300]  his shoveling stuff in the video you saw.
[54:22.780 --> 54:25.000]  It's bullshit! Aiden's shovel for one
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.900]  second longer than what you watched. You watched
[54:26.900 --> 54:27.980]  the entirety of his effort.
[54:28.920 --> 54:30.920]  Alright, let's just see how the main
[54:30.920 --> 54:32.260]  cut of this video turns out.
[54:36.020 --> 54:37.140]  I got all the footage
[54:37.140 --> 54:37.380]  set.
[54:41.500 --> 54:43.200]  I would say, yeah, it was mainly
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.860]  me filming. No, I'm just kidding.
[54:45.020 --> 54:47.400]  You filmed a lot. I probably put in
[54:47.400 --> 54:49.100]  like 20-25% of the digging.
[54:49.360 --> 54:50.860]  You did two shifts. You certainly broke the hammer.
[54:51.220 --> 54:53.000]  That was good. Yeah. I thought that
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.420]  hammer thing was such a good idea.
[54:55.620 --> 54:57.280]  It was. It made a great video.
[55:02.600 --> 55:03.180]  Can you
[55:03.180 --> 55:04.960]  send me that later, Gavin? That video? I just
[55:04.960 --> 55:06.240]  need to have it in my life.
[55:09.580 --> 55:11.260]  I need to be able to go back
[55:11.260 --> 55:12.000]  and watch it.
[55:13.380 --> 55:15.000]  Are you going to be watching that in bed tonight?
[55:15.380 --> 55:16.760]  Yeah, I will. I'll be laying down.
[55:17.060 --> 55:19.020]  You sent me a video once of
[55:19.020 --> 55:21.160]  your trash cans getting hit
[55:21.160 --> 55:22.820]  over and over by different things.
[55:26.060 --> 55:28.280]  It's like a three...
[55:28.280 --> 55:31.020]  It was like a three-act story of like your
[55:31.020 --> 55:32.860]  trash can got stolen and then
[55:32.860 --> 55:34.820]  you got a new one and then the garbage
[55:34.820 --> 55:36.800]  truck took it and then you got a new one
[55:36.800 --> 55:38.620]  and then somebody hit it with a car
[55:38.620 --> 55:41.140]  and that is the video that I just...
[55:41.140 --> 55:42.680]  It was, uh...
[55:43.180 --> 55:44.920]  That's what doesn't really come across in the video
[55:44.920 --> 55:46.900]  is that when... and it's recycling
[55:46.900 --> 55:49.040]  so it's every two weeks. When your recycling
[55:49.040 --> 55:49.940]  gets eaten
[55:50.840 --> 55:53.060]  they don't bring another one until like the next
[55:53.060 --> 55:55.080]  cycle. So I'm missing a recycling
[55:55.080 --> 55:57.000]  and I wait two weeks
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.840]  for one to come. I have it for a week.
[55:58.840 --> 56:00.560]  It gets swallowed again by the truck.
[56:01.100 --> 56:02.660]  I request another one.
[56:02.900 --> 56:04.740]  You know, we're talking like six weeks in
[56:04.740 --> 56:06.140]  at this point. I'm on my third bin.
[56:06.500 --> 56:07.700]  The neighbor steals it.
[56:08.580 --> 56:10.380]  I request another one and then
[56:10.380 --> 56:13.100]  finally a car drives into it
[56:13.100 --> 56:13.500]  because
[56:14.500 --> 56:17.200]  my alcoholic neighbors went for a drive.
[56:20.400 --> 56:22.960]  I'm a lot faster at bringing them in now.
[56:24.200 --> 56:26.780]  You live the real story of these people
[56:26.780 --> 56:28.680]  People hate cans, but it's just everybody
[56:28.680 --> 56:30.420]  and specifically yours.
[56:31.980 --> 56:33.400]  It's just your can.
[56:38.760 --> 56:40.920]  I missed you guys. This was a lot of fun.
[56:40.980 --> 56:42.060]  I missed you too, man.
[56:42.320 --> 56:45.060]  I missed all you guys. I'm excited to play Halo again too.
[56:45.680 --> 56:46.520]  We need to do that.
[56:46.660 --> 56:48.940]  We need to play games again. We need to record
[56:48.940 --> 56:50.820]  another episode. There's another thing we need to do.
[56:50.880 --> 56:52.660]  We should probably wrap up. Let's do that right now.
[56:52.900 --> 56:53.460]  On this one.
[56:54.440 --> 56:56.800]  Well, there you go. You've gone
[56:56.800 --> 56:57.680]  and listened to
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.580]  wasted another hour
[57:01.580 --> 57:02.760]  listening to
[57:02.760 --> 57:04.780]  Click and Clack and Geoff and Gavin
[57:04.780 --> 57:07.080]  and Eric and Nick
[57:07.080 --> 57:08.680]  and Andrew
[57:09.400 --> 57:10.880]  and we sure
[57:10.880 --> 57:12.660]  hope you enjoyed it because we
[57:12.660 --> 57:14.320]  enjoyed catching up and
[57:14.320 --> 57:17.140]  you know, mixing it up a little bit
[57:17.140 --> 57:18.500]  shooting the shit as it were
[57:18.500 --> 57:21.180]  and it was a good time
[57:21.180 --> 57:22.960]  and so
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.100]  if you thought it was a good time
[57:24.100 --> 57:25.900]  why don't you go ahead and drop a little like
[57:25.900 --> 57:27.780]  down there or a plus one
[57:27.780 --> 57:29.880]  or a, I don't know
[57:29.880 --> 57:32.080]  five stars out of five
[57:32.080 --> 57:34.580]  if there's more options, put more stars
[57:34.580 --> 57:36.500]  if it's ten out of ten stars, do the ten stars
[57:37.100 --> 57:38.100]  if it's on a hundred
[57:38.100 --> 57:40.180]  scale, give us, you don't have to give us a hundred
[57:40.180 --> 57:41.580]  but give us like a 98 at least
[57:42.140 --> 57:44.340]  make us at least as good as a condom
[57:44.340 --> 57:45.300]  is effective
[57:46.140 --> 57:47.540]  and we'll see you next time.
[57:47.840 --> 57:50.140]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack here with a look at next
[57:50.140 --> 57:51.640]  week's episode of F*** Face
[57:51.640 --> 57:53.740]  It's episode 96 and the
[57:53.740 --> 57:55.200]  fridge strikes back
[57:55.200 --> 57:56.920]  The boys go cup crazy
[57:56.920 --> 57:59.200]  Gavin has a good cat back
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.260]  Tommy Lee Jones is a F*** Face fan
[58:01.260 --> 58:03.000]  Geoff is ready to hit some balls
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.660]  and once again, Andrew does not eat the
[58:05.660 --> 58:07.820]  pencil. All that and more on next week's
[58:07.820 --> 58:09.180]  episode of F*** Face
