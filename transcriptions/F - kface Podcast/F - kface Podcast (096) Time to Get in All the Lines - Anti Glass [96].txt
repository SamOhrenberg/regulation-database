[00:24.140 --> 00:25.720]  Previously on F*** Face.
[00:35.880 --> 00:39.560]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.300]  I believe this is number 95, is that correct?
[00:42.740 --> 00:44.300]  96. Are you serious?
[00:45.060 --> 00:45.520]  Is it 96?
[00:46.340 --> 00:48.140]  It's a 96. Do you not keep the chat up?
[00:48.380 --> 00:50.880]  Oh, I had it switched over when I hit record. I see it now.
[00:51.060 --> 00:56.620]  Hello and welcome to the episode 96 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:57.260 --> 00:58.880]  Nick says, ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:59.240 --> 01:01.460]  See, I'm looking at the chat now, so I get all the important information.
[01:02.740 --> 01:06.220]  Season four, year two, episode 96.
[01:06.580 --> 01:08.180]  Andrew, Gavin, go ahead. Hello.
[01:08.680 --> 01:13.080]  I expected you to just open this by yelling, f*** glass, because you were very,
[01:13.160 --> 01:16.040]  you're very passionate about it in the last episode.
[01:17.640 --> 01:21.680]  Man, yeah, I'm f***ing, what do y'all want to talk about?
[01:21.700 --> 01:23.940]  What do you guys got going on? Andrew, what's been happening with you?
[01:24.200 --> 01:27.200]  Well, I mean, I want to know about f*** glass is what I'd like to know.
[01:27.300 --> 01:30.200]  If you're open to talking about, I want to go deep on the glass talk.
[01:30.200 --> 01:32.420]  I'll go. We'll go into the glass talk if you want.
[01:32.600 --> 01:34.760]  I just realized, though, before you get onto glass,
[01:34.860 --> 01:37.360]  we didn't do the thing that we said we were going to do last time.
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.080]  God damn it. We didn't talk about answering Geoff's bike.
[01:41.220 --> 01:43.840]  God damn it. So let me.
[01:44.020 --> 01:45.920]  OK, we're going to go behind the curtain.
[01:46.240 --> 01:47.880]  No, we're going to go behind the curtain on this.
[01:48.080 --> 01:50.480]  So I listened to it and I took down all the notes.
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.320]  I text, decide this idea is because Jack always does the next time on
[01:55.320 --> 01:58.200]  and he bases it on our Discord conversation
[01:58.200 --> 02:00.420]  and the photos that we exchange while we record.
[02:00.800 --> 02:02.220]  But we hadn't had anything recorded.
[02:02.440 --> 02:04.420]  So Jack just made up a bunch of stuff.
[02:04.420 --> 02:08.080]  So I said it would be funny if we use Jack's made up outline
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.980]  as sort of our show that we covered everything Jack talked about.
[02:12.060 --> 02:13.340]  So his outline would end up being correct.
[02:13.620 --> 02:17.740]  I then realized I hadn't spoken to either of you guys in a month
[02:17.740 --> 02:19.860]  and I didn't want to do I just wanted to talk to both.
[02:19.960 --> 02:21.580]  So I stepped away from it.
[02:21.600 --> 02:23.260]  Oh, OK. Well, you know what?
[02:23.300 --> 02:26.980]  We faced ourselves by not doing it because our friendship is more important.
[02:27.060 --> 02:30.020]  And isn't that the spirit of the show anyway?
[02:30.340 --> 02:34.160]  And then I thought about bringing it back up again for like four episodes from now,
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.200]  because that would also be very funny if we randomly covered all those things.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.480]  OK, we all got to do that.
[02:40.540 --> 02:41.880]  So I've got to try and smuggle something.
[02:43.620 --> 02:45.760]  Geoff needs to start ant colony in a bike.
[02:46.100 --> 02:48.640]  Yeah, based on the way you were talking before you left,
[02:48.680 --> 02:50.840]  I thought a butt plug may be smuggled back.
[02:50.960 --> 02:52.980]  And in some way, you're asking about metals.
[02:53.220 --> 02:54.960]  It seemed like you had something planned.
[02:55.780 --> 02:57.220]  Gavin, do you own a butt plug?
[02:57.780 --> 03:00.040]  No, I've never owned a butt plug.
[03:00.040 --> 03:01.700]  What, instantly was too slow?
[03:02.260 --> 03:03.100]  No, it wasn't instant.
[03:04.400 --> 03:06.820]  I think he's got butt plug plans is what he has.
[03:07.020 --> 03:10.280]  I think he probably rents them so he doesn't have to say he owns them.
[03:11.420 --> 03:13.340]  Imagine a blockbuster for butt plugs.
[03:13.440 --> 03:14.640]  Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.
[03:14.800 --> 03:17.220]  The late fees on a butt plug would be horrendous.
[03:17.440 --> 03:17.760]  Buttbuster.
[03:18.920 --> 03:21.240]  What would be like, you have to clean, be kind, clean.
[03:21.380 --> 03:23.820]  Like, what would be the be kind rewind of the butt plug?
[03:24.180 --> 03:25.600]  Be kind, give it a wipe.
[03:27.180 --> 03:30.120]  Doesn't quite roll off the tongue, but it's like there's something there.
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.600]  What would be the slogan for butt plug rentals?
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.440]  Be kind to others behind.
[03:37.620 --> 03:40.620]  Well, that doesn't help the next renter, does it?
[03:40.680 --> 03:42.380]  Be kind to others behind.
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.460]  I mean, I guess if you're cleaning the butt plug, you are being kind to their behind.
[03:47.580 --> 03:53.920]  Because they're getting, you know, gross fluids, you know, injected into you or vice versa.
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.420]  I'm really, I don't know, maybe I have it built up in my head, but the way you were talking before, Gavin,
[03:58.420 --> 04:02.660]  it sounded like you were going to be fucking Tony Stark in a cave building a butt plug.
[04:02.840 --> 04:07.740]  It's the tone I got from you're asking about metals and making a titanium butt plug.
[04:08.280 --> 04:10.140]  Yeah, yeah, I'm excited.
[04:10.280 --> 04:12.640]  I'm anticipating that being a thing at some point.
[04:12.720 --> 04:14.760]  I need to give your mom something for her birthday.
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.160]  I don't like that you tying it to that at all.
[04:18.260 --> 04:20.780]  It doesn't need to be a gift in the slightest.
[04:21.060 --> 04:22.460]  She likes high-end extravagant things.
[04:24.360 --> 04:26.420]  That is, that is true.
[04:26.680 --> 04:27.940]  I can't argue that point.
[04:28.980 --> 04:31.840]  And I've got to, we've got to have a gift when we get there.
[04:32.620 --> 04:34.500]  Okay, I love where this is going.
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.120]  Andrew is not into this.
[04:36.220 --> 04:36.800]  This is great.
[04:37.100 --> 04:38.180]  No, I'm not into this at all.
[04:38.320 --> 04:38.780]  And that's okay.
[04:39.220 --> 04:40.060]  I'll back down from here.
[04:40.820 --> 04:42.180]  Don't back down, double down.
[04:47.880 --> 04:49.080]  I can add to the list.
[04:49.220 --> 04:50.740]  Geoff doesn't even know what I've planned for him.
[04:51.220 --> 04:52.200]  I'll add to the Gavin list.
[04:55.840 --> 04:58.280]  I gotta think, I can't wait to talk about it on the show.
[04:58.280 --> 05:02.860]  Geoff, Geoff completely fucked me over and I can't talk about why yet.
[05:03.220 --> 05:05.900]  But Geoff, without even knowing it, got me.
[05:05.960 --> 05:06.820]  Didn't he do that recently?
[05:08.080 --> 05:08.940]  He did do it recently.
[05:09.200 --> 05:10.240]  I think I mentioned it before.
[05:10.320 --> 05:13.900]  I can't talk about it yet because I haven't, the whole plan hasn't come through.
[05:14.360 --> 05:20.640]  But, at some point, I'll be able to talk about a story in which Geoff completely screwed me over without his knowledge.
[05:20.820 --> 05:21.540]  And it's very funny.
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.800]  But I got plans.
[05:23.060 --> 05:23.740]  I'm retaliating.
[05:24.140 --> 05:25.020]  Not retaliating.
[05:25.240 --> 05:25.920]  Let me recorrect.
[05:26.040 --> 05:28.200]  Let me, let me go back on my, I'm gifting.
[05:28.200 --> 05:28.880]  I'm re-gifting.
[05:29.280 --> 05:36.180]  I'm gonna enjoy sending you a nice friendship gift to return the delightful favor of you mailing me the bubble wrap.
[05:37.580 --> 05:38.400]  Okay, man.
[05:39.180 --> 05:40.980]  I, you know, it was sent with love.
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.800]  Just try to remember that and hopefully...
[05:42.800 --> 05:43.280]  So is mine.
[05:43.540 --> 05:44.560]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[05:44.820 --> 05:45.660]  Let me ask you a question.
[05:45.940 --> 05:46.140]  Yeah.
[05:46.260 --> 05:47.900]  Since we last spoke, have you sprained your ankle?
[05:48.140 --> 05:50.280]  I haven't been able to walk since, yes.
[05:50.560 --> 05:51.780]  No, I think I've had two days.
[05:51.960 --> 05:54.300]  I've kept spraining it and or dealing with issues.
[05:54.380 --> 05:56.840]  Did you lay the bubble wrap out everywhere like I instructed?
[05:57.300 --> 05:58.000]  I know.
[05:58.200 --> 05:58.720]  I did not.
[05:59.020 --> 05:59.900]  So fucking listen to me, dude.
[05:59.920 --> 06:01.980]  You'd be walking around like a pro right now.
[06:02.420 --> 06:05.820]  The haircut was a window of time in which I was able to walk without issues.
[06:06.160 --> 06:08.100]  So after the haircut, you re-sprained?
[06:08.420 --> 06:09.860]  Oh, after the haircut, I re-sprained.
[06:09.980 --> 06:13.900]  I was trying to get up and I got up at a bad angle and my foot...
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.260]  I can't, I can't handle.
[06:16.640 --> 06:17.440]  This motherfucker...
[06:17.440 --> 06:19.280]  It's absolutely ridiculous, Andrew.
[06:19.680 --> 06:22.380]  This is not a normal life that you've got.
[06:22.760 --> 06:24.080]  No, this is what, I was turned.
[06:24.080 --> 06:29.760]  I had my chair to my desk and my feet at the base of my bed and I decided to get up.
[06:30.040 --> 06:32.800]  But my feet were in my box spring.
[06:33.340 --> 06:38.760]  And so when I stood up, it kind of popped a little bit because I came up at a little bit of a strange angle and it was uneven.
[06:39.420 --> 06:41.480]  And so I've been dealing with that for the last two days.
[06:43.600 --> 06:52.760]  This motherfucker, literally, you literally got the solution to all of your problems gift-wrapped and mailed to you and you won't use it.
[06:52.760 --> 06:54.420]  It's like he thinks it's a joke.
[06:55.080 --> 06:56.980]  Well, yeah, you don't know.
[06:57.100 --> 07:02.980]  I think it's a very thoughtful gift that I cannot wait to return the favor with my own thing.
[07:03.420 --> 07:04.100]  I can't wait.
[07:04.180 --> 07:07.280]  Well, if it's it all dependent on you walking there.
[07:07.340 --> 07:08.080]  I'm not, I'm not.
[07:08.300 --> 07:09.780]  I'm going to be completely honest with you here.
[07:10.060 --> 07:13.360]  If you wouldn't have canceled MVP 2, you'd be getting it today.
[07:13.820 --> 07:14.760]  It would happen today.
[07:17.920 --> 07:19.980]  You've saved yourself once again, accidentally.
[07:20.200 --> 07:21.140]  You don't even know what you did.
[07:21.140 --> 07:24.440]  But you once, when you canceled it, I was like, fuck.
[07:24.700 --> 07:26.080]  Okay, later.
[07:26.600 --> 07:27.020]  Do it later.
[07:27.180 --> 07:27.400]  All right.
[07:27.620 --> 07:28.100]  Well, that's good.
[07:28.140 --> 07:28.680]  It's in the works.
[07:29.140 --> 07:29.920]  Good to know.
[07:30.340 --> 07:31.380]  But let's talk about Glass.
[07:31.640 --> 07:36.780]  Eric, I think it might, I think future schedulings of MVP 2 might prove to be very difficult.
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.140]  It's not tied to MVP 2.
[07:39.340 --> 07:39.920]  You're an idiot.
[07:40.080 --> 07:40.980]  It's not tied to that.
[07:41.360 --> 07:41.700]  We'll see.
[07:43.280 --> 07:44.600]  Here's, I'll talk about Glass.
[07:44.760 --> 07:50.340]  But first, I want to, because we, last episode, we had a lot of callbacks and I was enjoying it.
[07:50.340 --> 07:52.760]  We were, we were going, we went all the way back to episode one with the hair.
[07:53.360 --> 07:54.500]  We went back a few times.
[07:55.520 --> 07:56.540]  Do you guys remember?
[07:57.040 --> 08:04.080]  I want to tell you a little story about one of my adventures, since we all last spoke, was fridge related.
[08:04.260 --> 08:05.560]  Do you guys remember about a year ago?
[08:06.020 --> 08:07.260]  Trying to figure out how I want to tell this.
[08:07.320 --> 08:13.040]  Do you guys remember about a year ago when I, I had some fridge problems and I decided to price out a new fridge, but the fridge was the price.
[08:13.060 --> 08:13.920]  Yeah, you had Applejack come over.
[08:14.240 --> 08:14.520]  Yeah.
[08:16.500 --> 08:20.000]  Yeah, I remember a broom sort of lent against the door at one point or something.
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:22.800 --> 08:30.820]  And he was able to kind of like Mickey Mouse it back together so that it worked, but was like, you know, it's no good, man.
[08:30.940 --> 08:32.000]  It's not, it's no good.
[08:32.060 --> 08:32.840]  And I was like, okay.
[08:35.420 --> 08:41.880]  And, and I went and I got it priced out, priced out a new one to fit the peculiar size of my recessed fridge.
[08:42.600 --> 08:46.040]  And it was going to be the price of a jet ski, a new jet ski, not a used jet ski.
[08:46.440 --> 08:47.780]  And then we all laughed about it.
[08:47.780 --> 08:53.800]  And then we decided, you know, I'll put that off because it's the fridge is mostly working.
[08:53.980 --> 08:54.760]  It's working.
[08:55.020 --> 08:57.580]  It's doing like 70% of the things it should do.
[08:57.920 --> 08:59.820]  So that's, that's pretty good, right?
[08:59.820 --> 09:00.520]  It's better than half.
[09:02.300 --> 09:09.600]  The Monday of this week, I was looking at it and a piece of it broke off.
[09:09.880 --> 09:11.440]  And I thought, you know what?
[09:11.500 --> 09:11.860]  Fuck it.
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.120]  I'm sick of like the shelves keep getting lower because they keep breaking and I have less and less.
[09:17.120 --> 09:21.700]  So I have like the top part of my fridge is just getting, it's just a lot of open air now.
[09:22.360 --> 09:23.920]  You can put really tall things.
[09:24.080 --> 09:26.000]  Yeah, I can put super tall stuff in my fridge.
[09:26.300 --> 09:27.120]  So I thought, fuck it.
[09:27.160 --> 09:35.240]  I'm gonna go to those people and I'm going to say, hey, let me go ahead and get that fridge because I know the fridge is working, but it's, you know, it's, it's on its last legs, right?
[09:36.020 --> 09:39.180]  So I go to the place and I say, hey, remember me?
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.800]  And they're like, absolutely not.
[09:40.820 --> 09:41.840]  I have no memory of you whatsoever.
[09:41.940 --> 09:44.480]  It's been a year and I talked to you for three minutes and I was like, that's totally fair.
[09:45.300 --> 09:46.960]  But they were able to find me in their system.
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.920]  And I don't know if you remember, but last time they told me it would be five to eight weeks to get my fridge.
[09:55.140 --> 09:56.680]  And I thought, well, that's ridiculous.
[09:57.220 --> 10:02.980]  Well, this time I came in and they said, well, there's going to be a bit of a, some things have changed since you were last here.
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.020]  And I go, okay.
[10:04.740 --> 10:06.900]  She goes, there's gonna be a bit of a wait.
[10:06.960 --> 10:09.500]  And I go, oh yeah, she told me last time it could be like two months.
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.940]  And she goes, well, it's running a little longer than two months, but that's not the biggest thing.
[10:13.940 --> 10:16.080]  The biggest thing is it's a little bit more expensive now.
[10:16.200 --> 10:19.320]  And I was like, oh, well, how, how much has it gone up in price?
[10:19.440 --> 10:22.320]  And she goes, well, it's about $2,000 more than it was.
[10:24.160 --> 10:24.560]  Okay.
[10:25.260 --> 10:25.940]  All right.
[10:26.320 --> 10:27.880]  That's, uh, that's on me.
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.720]  That's like a fridge for two grand.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.080]  It's like an 88.
[10:35.280 --> 10:36.860]  It's like an 88 Corolla.
[10:39.480 --> 10:41.220]  I go, okay, that's on me.
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.560]  But you know what?
[10:42.980 --> 10:48.840]  Better to get ahead of this now than have it to do it in a year and have it be another thousand or $2,000 on top of that.
[10:48.980 --> 10:56.040]  You know, like I don't think things aren't trending in a good direction and considering like the global supply chain issues and World War III and everything.
[10:56.280 --> 10:59.880]  I feel like shit's just gonna continue to get harder and harder to get and more expensive.
[11:00.200 --> 11:02.120]  So I was like, fuck it.
[11:02.160 --> 11:03.060]  I'm getting this fridge.
[11:03.140 --> 11:03.760]  I said, you know what?
[11:03.800 --> 11:04.120]  Fine.
[11:04.280 --> 11:05.020]  We'll do it.
[11:05.360 --> 11:07.300]  And I said, so what, it's like two months?
[11:07.400 --> 11:08.220]  And she goes, oh, yeah, right.
[11:08.280 --> 11:08.620]  No, sorry.
[11:08.640 --> 11:09.460]  I didn't get to finish that.
[11:09.720 --> 11:10.800]  It's, uh, let me see.
[11:10.800 --> 11:11.360]  Let me put it in.
[11:11.660 --> 11:17.000]  It is, you know, essentially March, the first week of March or second week of March.
[11:17.520 --> 11:19.360]  You can have it next March.
[11:20.780 --> 11:21.920]  And I say, excuse me?
[11:22.020 --> 11:23.380]  And she goes, yeah, there's about a year.
[11:23.840 --> 11:25.420]  It's about a year now to get it in.
[11:26.880 --> 11:27.520]  Oh, Jesus.
[11:28.040 --> 11:30.420]  I might as well have one now as myself, just in case.
[11:30.680 --> 11:31.280]  Just in case.
[11:31.340 --> 11:32.860]  And I went, are you fucking serious?
[11:33.020 --> 11:34.060]  And she was like, oh, yeah.
[11:34.700 --> 11:35.920]  She was like nice about it.
[11:35.940 --> 11:40.360]  But she was like, I welcome you to go and try to find a fridge anywhere else on Earth right now faster.
[11:40.800 --> 11:42.300]  And I'm like, yeah, I get it.
[11:42.440 --> 11:43.340]  I can get you a fridge.
[11:43.820 --> 11:45.580]  And not that fits the size.
[11:46.460 --> 11:50.120]  And then I go, she goes, oh, well, also, this is last year's fridge.
[11:50.200 --> 11:52.520]  Did you want to, I mean, you could do this year's fridge.
[11:52.740 --> 11:54.660]  And I went, oh, well, that's a good point.
[11:54.720 --> 11:58.260]  If it's like you have a new model, what's the lead time on a new model?
[11:58.340 --> 11:59.000]  And she goes, let me check.
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.340]  Oh, it's about a year and a half.
[12:01.620 --> 12:04.400]  So if you want to, and I was like, no, no, no, no, we're going last year's fridge, last year's fridge.
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.300]  Please, please, please, please, please.
[12:06.480 --> 12:16.200]  So anyway, I f***ing faced myself hard to the tune of when it's all said and done, two years to get a fridge that I should have bought and $2,000 more.
[12:16.500 --> 12:20.260]  So my stupidity cost me a grand a year for two years.
[12:20.380 --> 12:24.160]  So does that mean there won't, are they still going to have like a next year's fridge?
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.760]  If the lead time is over a year on a fridge, I don't f***ing know.
[12:27.800 --> 12:28.940]  They might as well just skip a year.
[12:29.080 --> 12:30.420]  They might as well just stop making fridges.
[12:32.020 --> 12:33.340]  Yeah, that'll fix the problem.
[12:33.420 --> 12:34.000]  Less fridges.
[12:34.480 --> 12:40.220]  When you order, when you order the fridge, are you fully paid for at this point?
[12:40.540 --> 12:41.300]  Are you locked in?
[12:41.500 --> 12:42.420]  Oh, I fully paid for it.
[12:42.460 --> 12:47.980]  I have, I have, I sent off the money and in one year, it's going to fly back to me as a refrigerator.
[12:48.500 --> 12:51.160]  Are you, but are you like, you cannot get out of this fridge now.
[12:51.240 --> 12:52.420]  You are now stuck with this fridge.
[12:52.520 --> 12:54.660]  You cannot get a refund for the money you put in.
[12:54.760 --> 12:55.340]  There's no point.
[12:55.640 --> 12:57.200]  I mean, I don't know.
[12:57.540 --> 13:00.920]  I don't intend on putting myself to the back of the line again.
[13:01.720 --> 13:04.160]  So I'll take this fridge with me wherever I go.
[13:04.420 --> 13:07.000]  Like this fridge and I are bonded for life.
[13:07.980 --> 13:12.980]  I like the idea of just constantly making sure you're always in the queue, but not necessarily needing.
[13:13.460 --> 13:16.100]  Like being in, yeah, I'm four months into my fridge.
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.460]  I got a dryer at six months.
[13:17.540 --> 13:20.160]  I don't need it right now, but I can pull out whatever I need to.
[13:20.480 --> 13:21.800]  I'm just constantly in the queue.
[13:21.920 --> 13:23.260]  I don't want to be stuck in the back of the line.
[13:23.320 --> 13:25.360]  I think now's the time just to get in all the lines.
[13:25.700 --> 13:30.040]  Like, yeah, no matter what you do, I'm going to stop by a shower, you know, all this crap.
[13:30.040 --> 13:37.880]  If everybody was smart, they would liquidate their savings account and they would go in and they would put orders on commercial fridges.
[13:38.120 --> 13:46.880]  And then, in a year, when they get that fridge in, put it up on eBay like a tickle-me-elmo and sell it for $10,000 more than you paid for it.
[13:47.540 --> 13:50.360]  Imagining like, Wolf of Wall Street, sell me this pen.
[13:50.640 --> 13:52.060]  But it's like, sell me this fridge.
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.000]  Sell me this $10,000, this massive fridge.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.740]  What's the word for when you buy a bunch of shit and sell it way more expensive in times of peril?
[14:02.740 --> 14:03.420]  What did you say?
[14:03.860 --> 14:08.120]  It's like when people buy all the bog roll and then they start flogging it for like four times the price to people.
[14:08.260 --> 14:08.980]  Oh, price gouging?
[14:09.500 --> 14:10.180]  Profiteering, that was it.
[14:10.420 --> 14:10.740]  Profiteering.
[14:11.540 --> 14:11.740]  Yeah.
[14:12.640 --> 14:14.000]  You're going to be fridge profiteering.
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.540]  So, do you have a fridge that works currently?
[14:18.140 --> 14:20.680]  I mean, I have the fridge that most of it works, yeah.
[14:21.380 --> 14:23.320]  I mean, it still doesn't do the things that it didn't used to do.
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.840]  Like, one of the shelves on the side broke off, so I just have one less row again.
[14:30.340 --> 14:32.660]  I'm down to about 70% of my rows.
[14:32.780 --> 14:33.580]  And then, of course, the lights.
[14:33.980 --> 14:36.720]  And then, of course, the rusty ice and the water not working.
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.980]  So, if the next time I was at your house, I just broke your fridge as a joke, that'd be...
[14:42.980 --> 14:44.340]  You'd be absolutely screwed.
[14:44.640 --> 14:45.620]  That'd be quite a joke.
[14:45.960 --> 14:46.880]  Quite a joke.
[14:47.040 --> 14:52.820]  You know, lucky for Geoff, he's friends with somebody who fills the need whenever this has happened.
[14:52.820 --> 14:58.400]  There is a plumbing issue in the past, and I came in and I saved the day.
[14:58.500 --> 15:01.360]  And it sounds to me this is another scenario where you might need a fridge.
[15:01.620 --> 15:08.320]  You need a fridge of some kind. A thing that cools items, I guess, is what we could say.
[15:08.740 --> 15:10.940]  I think I could do this. I think I could get a fridge for you.
[15:11.640 --> 15:16.040]  I'm just saying, I think my fridge laundromat idea is making more sense than ever.
[15:16.160 --> 15:18.240]  I think people are really gonna start to do that business.
[15:18.740 --> 15:23.560]  Dude, if William Perry shows up at my house, knocks on my front door and says,
[15:23.700 --> 15:29.400]  I'm here to keep your shit cool, bro. I'll fucking... I'll be indebted to you for life. That would be awesome.
[15:29.500 --> 15:32.340]  William Perry with like a cooler over himself.
[15:32.580 --> 15:34.920]  It's like suspenders, but it's a cooler.
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.720]  Gavin, you don't know who William Perry is because you're British, but he was a Chicago Bear football player
[15:42.720 --> 15:47.580]  who his nickname was William the Refrigerator Perry because he was as big as a...
[15:47.580 --> 15:52.980]  and just kind of shaped like a fridge. And he famously scored a touchdown in the Super Bowl.
[15:53.060 --> 15:54.820]  And then became an amateur boxer for a while.
[15:55.500 --> 15:59.900]  That's a great nickname for a boxer. Was he still the Refrigerator as a boxer?
[16:00.160 --> 16:02.740]  Once you're the Refrigerator, you are always the Refrigerator.
[16:03.800 --> 16:06.680]  Nothing... I think the best sports nickname I ever heard...
[16:06.680 --> 16:11.060]  And I want to say he was the last person... He was either the first...
[16:11.060 --> 16:16.200]  He was in one of the first NFL drafts. His name was Bob Train and his nickname was Choo Choo.
[16:16.200 --> 16:18.680]  So he's listed as Bob Choo Choo Train.
[16:19.160 --> 16:21.500]  That's a lot cooler than a fridge-related nickname.
[16:22.400 --> 16:25.460]  Dude, I heard a fucking nickname the other day.
[16:27.220 --> 16:30.780]  It was so fucking funny. Who was it?
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.240]  I'd be Gavin Freon, by the way, if I was going fridge-themed.
[16:39.240 --> 16:42.740]  We were in the pleasantries, we were talking about the Clippers and the Lakers.
[16:42.740 --> 16:45.800]  The different trajectories of their seasons, Eric was.
[16:46.320 --> 16:51.480]  There's a player on the Los Angeles Clippers, his name is Reggie Jackson.
[16:52.180 --> 16:57.200]  And his new nickname that everybody's calling him is Stimulus Check because he keeps bailing the team out.
[17:00.300 --> 17:05.360]  I was watching a game the other day and they kept calling him Stimulus Check and I thought that was the funniest fucking thing.
[17:06.640 --> 17:08.220]  You gotta love a current nickname.
[17:09.840 --> 17:11.680]  Oh, and they call him Big Government.
[17:11.680 --> 17:13.000]  Big Government's good.
[17:13.160 --> 17:18.680]  I think my favorite nickname for any athlete is somebody call themselves the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[17:19.100 --> 17:20.500]  Or the MMA fighter.
[17:21.360 --> 17:23.520]  Julian the Cuban Missile Crisis Marquez.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.040]  It's just so long.
[17:25.260 --> 17:26.000]  It's pretty long.
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.620]  But Glass! I still don't know about Glass. We're talking about your fridge.
[17:33.280 --> 17:34.880]  How does this tie into your hatred of Glass?
[17:35.500 --> 17:36.280]  Oh, man.
[17:36.560 --> 17:37.300]  Fucking Glass.
[17:37.520 --> 17:40.480]  No, I just like... Y'all go...
[17:40.480 --> 17:41.720]  We're never gonna hit the store.
[17:42.220 --> 17:45.200]  Y'all know... Y'all know... Y'all have Glass, right?
[17:46.100 --> 17:46.460]  Yes.
[17:47.300 --> 17:47.660]  Yeah.
[17:48.020 --> 17:50.460]  I have it in my windows. I have it on some doors.
[17:50.980 --> 17:51.820]  Yeah, that's fine. I don't give a shit about that.
[17:51.880 --> 17:54.340]  You know, like Glass that you drink out of. Like Glass A's.
[17:55.160 --> 17:55.320]  Yeah.
[17:55.880 --> 17:57.400]  They fucking suck, am I right?
[17:57.960 --> 17:58.320]  Like...
[17:58.840 --> 18:07.180]  Am I the only person that every other time I open up my dishwasher, there's a fucking... I pull out one of my Glasses, it's broken and it cuts my fucking hand and slices it?
[18:07.360 --> 18:08.780]  I'm so fucking sick of it.
[18:08.780 --> 18:15.360]  I'm so sick of Glass. It's so fucking... It's such a fallible material to put near your mouth.
[18:15.980 --> 18:22.060]  And I'm so... I bought like... When I moved into this house, I bought like 12 cups. Like Glass... I'm sorry, I shouldn't say cups. I bought 12 Glasses, right?
[18:22.280 --> 18:24.100]  I'm down to like three of them.
[18:24.380 --> 18:29.280]  Because they just... They shatter. They... You put them down wrong and they just fucking fall apart.
[18:29.600 --> 18:35.120]  And it's not just this brand. I've had other Glasses. I've had pint Glasses that I get free from shit.
[18:35.600 --> 18:38.180]  They just... Glass sucks. It just fucking sucks.
[18:38.180 --> 18:40.820]  And if Glass goes wrong, it only hurts you.
[18:41.240 --> 18:43.200]  It's only job is to hurt you.
[18:43.440 --> 18:46.820]  Does your dishwasher say rock tumbler on the front? Like what? What's going on with it?
[18:46.880 --> 18:49.660]  It's not just dishwashers, dude. Glasses break everywhere.
[18:50.140 --> 18:51.000]  They fucking suck.
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.640]  Dog walks by and hits a fucking coffee table. Glass falls off and shatters.
[18:57.080 --> 19:00.960]  Next thing you know, you've got Glass in your feet for the next month while you're trying to fucking find it all.
[19:01.240 --> 19:03.460]  It's just... It's stupid. It's fucking stupid.
[19:03.460 --> 19:09.760]  And I got to thinking, why don't we... I need to replace every Glass in my house with solid cups.
[19:10.180 --> 19:15.140]  Just like fucking hard... Like sturdy, not gonna shatter, badass cups.
[19:15.460 --> 19:17.500]  So that got me thinking...
[19:17.500 --> 19:19.000]  What's the best cup?
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.260]  Like there's a lot of different... And I was talking to Eric about it a little bit and then I got to talking to Andrew about it.
[19:23.560 --> 19:24.200]  Ice cup.
[19:24.700 --> 19:27.800]  I'm on the search for the perfect cup.
[19:28.280 --> 19:28.420]  Right?
[19:30.320 --> 19:31.780]  Nobody will know you drank.
[19:32.400 --> 19:33.340]  It's genius!
[19:35.940 --> 19:36.800]  I love it.
[19:36.880 --> 19:43.760]  Except your first fucking drink, you're gonna put it to your lips and you're gonna be like Ralphie in a Christmas story.
[19:44.420 --> 19:47.940]  Your mouth's gonna be frozen to your fucking...
[19:47.940 --> 19:52.840]  So I started doing research.
[19:53.240 --> 19:55.480]  Is this a Unifom thing?
[19:55.860 --> 19:56.940]  I think it could be.
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.760]  So I started polling people and asking what people's favorite cup is.
[20:00.760 --> 20:05.500]  And my girlfriend actually, I think, landed on the perfect cup, which I totally agree with.
[20:05.940 --> 20:11.100]  But I asked everybody ahead of time, you know, be thinking about it and let me know.
[20:11.400 --> 20:15.740]  So if everybody could just post what their favorite cup is, I think we can get somewhere.
[20:16.960 --> 20:19.000]  My favorite cup...
[20:19.000 --> 20:20.300]  Like the best cup.
[20:20.660 --> 20:24.260]  I need to draw... I need to do a blueprint of my favorite cup.
[20:24.320 --> 20:26.140]  I don't think the best cup exists yet.
[20:26.140 --> 20:32.240]  Yeah, when I mentioned it to you, you told me you were gonna design a cup like Homer Simpson designed a car, which scares me.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.620]  Well, it's because it's like if we're perfecting cup technology, we need to go some places with it.
[20:38.700 --> 20:42.200]  I will say I was very adamant about the fact that it needs to hold a liter of water.
[20:43.180 --> 20:43.680]  It's a minimum.
[20:44.160 --> 20:46.940]  One prerequisite, it must hold a liter of water.
[20:47.540 --> 20:48.320]  It needs a liter of water.
[20:48.460 --> 20:51.420]  Because they always say, like, drink eight cups of water a day.
[20:52.200 --> 20:53.920]  If you have a liter cup, that's four.
[20:53.920 --> 20:55.320]  You just need four cups of water.
[20:55.440 --> 20:58.300]  We're reducing the amount of refills you need.
[20:59.620 --> 21:00.820]  It's just a superior product.
[21:00.920 --> 21:02.080]  Like, just the math on it is better.
[21:02.560 --> 21:03.720]  Can't argue it's not more efficient.
[21:05.060 --> 21:05.900]  It's a great cup.
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.660]  What, uh, Eric, you said like a Rudy's cup.
[21:09.780 --> 21:10.220]  Which I agree.
[21:10.340 --> 21:13.460]  I got one from this place called, from this Mexican restaurant by my house.
[21:13.560 --> 21:14.620]  I think I sent you a photo.
[21:14.860 --> 21:15.920]  Let's see if I can put that up.
[21:16.540 --> 21:17.600]  That's a pretty good fucking cup.
[21:17.660 --> 21:18.500]  It's not perfect, but it's good.
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.520]  I think Rudy's does a classic, like a classic cup, right?
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.780]  It's like, this is the cup that you have a million of all through college or whatever.
[21:29.280 --> 21:30.440]  They last forever.
[21:30.720 --> 21:33.520]  And then your wife says, we don't need these cups anymore.
[21:33.520 --> 21:34.400]  And you go, you're right.
[21:34.460 --> 21:35.360]  We don't need these cups anymore.
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.000]  This is the one I got that kind of set the thinking off.
[21:39.860 --> 21:42.000]  So it's like the Rudy's cup, but maybe a little bigger.
[21:42.320 --> 21:44.320]  Just based on my thumb compared to your thumb.
[21:44.660 --> 21:45.640]  Against the cup.
[21:45.660 --> 21:47.400]  And I like this cup because it's huge.
[21:47.400 --> 21:47.960]  It's big.
[21:48.420 --> 21:50.660]  But it's still, and it's a little flexible.
[21:50.660 --> 21:52.500]  But I don't know that I want flexible in my cup.
[21:52.500 --> 21:55.300]  Because what if you grab it emphatically?
[21:55.480 --> 21:57.040]  You're going to spill, right?
[21:57.100 --> 21:58.060]  And I'm an emphatic person.
[21:58.160 --> 22:00.040]  I like to grab things emphatically from time to time.
[22:01.580 --> 22:06.460]  So a lot of people were recommending metal cups.
[22:06.720 --> 22:08.240]  Which I think is just ludicrous.
[22:08.340 --> 22:09.440]  I think it's a horrible idea.
[22:09.920 --> 22:10.780]  What don't you like about that?
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.080]  Well, I'll tell you what I don't like about it.
[22:12.080 --> 22:12.640]  A titanium cup.
[22:12.820 --> 22:14.960]  Crack a tooth on that plastic cup.
[22:15.100 --> 22:15.800]  You can't do it.
[22:16.780 --> 22:19.240]  Emphatically put a metal cup up to your mouth, not paying attention.
[22:19.480 --> 22:22.000]  Or you move a fraction of an inch the wrong way.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.040]  You're going to bash your own goddamn teeth in.
[22:24.460 --> 22:25.060]  It's stupid.
[22:25.060 --> 22:27.100]  I'd rather hit my teeth on metal than glass.
[22:27.420 --> 22:28.480]  Why not plastic?
[22:29.140 --> 22:30.420]  I'm recommending plastic.
[22:31.720 --> 22:32.600]  I agree.
[22:33.060 --> 22:34.880]  That's another reason glass sucks.
[22:35.140 --> 22:37.800]  What if you bash your tooth with the edge of a glass.
[22:37.940 --> 22:39.660]  And then it shatters the glass and your tooth.
[22:39.860 --> 22:41.440]  And then you end up eating a bunch of glass.
[22:41.660 --> 22:42.960]  Glass fucking sucks.
[22:43.220 --> 22:44.780]  Why are we putting it near our mouths?
[22:45.740 --> 22:51.480]  You know, I think historically there's never been a better time to embrace and make more things out of plastic.
[22:51.480 --> 22:55.680]  That's the exact direction that everyone is going in.
[22:56.020 --> 22:56.480]  Plastic blows.
[22:57.020 --> 22:58.360]  It makes it taste like plastic.
[22:58.720 --> 22:59.580]  No way.
[23:00.120 --> 23:02.400]  What's the thing that I'm going to eat caviar with?
[23:02.480 --> 23:04.260]  Because the metal spoon taints the taste.
[23:04.960 --> 23:05.790]  They use like a...
[23:06.740 --> 23:07.520]  What's that shit?
[23:07.600 --> 23:08.740]  Like Mother of Pearl or something?
[23:08.860 --> 23:11.280]  Maybe that's the material for a cup.
[23:11.960 --> 23:14.420]  Here's what I think the perfect cup is.
[23:15.060 --> 23:15.600]  Boom.
[23:16.280 --> 23:17.840]  That looks like a...
[23:17.840 --> 23:18.800]  The Pizza Hut cup.
[23:18.800 --> 23:27.440]  Have you ever had a soda, a diet coke, or a regular coke, or a Dr. Pepper with ice in that thing and not loved every second of it?
[23:27.620 --> 23:28.560]  Those cups...
[23:28.560 --> 23:31.100]  We perfected cups in the 1970s.
[23:31.980 --> 23:33.740]  And I don't know when we got away from them.
[23:33.840 --> 23:34.560]  I'm going to replace...
[23:35.080 --> 23:36.680]  I'm going to replace everything.
[23:37.240 --> 23:38.180]  It's because we're still...
[23:38.180 --> 23:41.780]  Because the places you're going are still using the ones from the 70s.
[23:41.840 --> 23:43.320]  Because they're still around.
[23:43.420 --> 23:44.460]  Because they last forever.
[23:44.680 --> 23:46.980]  And that's getting used by hundreds of people a day.
[23:46.980 --> 23:49.320]  You put those puppies in your house, Gavin.
[23:49.460 --> 23:52.920]  You would never even come close to seeing the half-life of that cup.
[23:53.160 --> 23:53.820]  It'll look...
[23:53.820 --> 23:55.380]  You'll be buried with it someday.
[23:55.480 --> 23:57.240]  Looking brand new.
[23:57.940 --> 23:59.000]  Nick and Grease, it rules.
[23:59.380 --> 24:01.000]  That cup full of ice is awesome.
[24:01.220 --> 24:02.380]  So I was talking to Andrew about it.
[24:02.620 --> 24:04.860]  And I was telling him, we need to invent the perfect cup.
[24:05.020 --> 24:06.540]  And that's my starting point.
[24:06.800 --> 24:07.480]  That material.
[24:07.940 --> 24:09.680]  That density.
[24:10.160 --> 24:10.840]  That weight.
[24:10.920 --> 24:12.540]  It's got a heft to it at the bottom.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.820]  It's solid.
[24:14.080 --> 24:14.840]  It's not malleable.
[24:14.960 --> 24:16.660]  It's not going to bash anybody's teeth in.
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.440]  It keeps stuff incredibly cool.
[24:18.560 --> 24:20.400]  It doesn't taste like plastic at all.
[24:20.640 --> 24:22.560]  It tastes like a Pizza Hut in 1975.
[24:22.940 --> 24:24.740]  Which is where everybody wants to be.
[24:24.840 --> 24:26.680]  And if you don't, there's something fucking wrong with you.
[24:27.100 --> 24:28.540]  And it's fun.
[24:29.380 --> 24:30.480]  So we start there.
[24:31.400 --> 24:32.720]  I ran out of shit.
[24:33.280 --> 24:33.700]  I'm just going.
[24:35.340 --> 24:37.900]  When Geoff first brought this up to me.
[24:38.460 --> 24:41.360]  I felt like I was being fucked with the entire time.
[24:41.360 --> 24:44.620]  It's one of the weirdest text chains I think I've ever had with you.
[24:44.740 --> 24:46.220]  And I don't know if it was by design.
[24:46.580 --> 24:47.820]  Or if you're just living your life.
[24:48.460 --> 24:50.580]  Geoff texted me at 10.21 a.m.
[24:50.880 --> 24:51.480]  On Sunday.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.040]  What's the perfect cup?
[24:53.420 --> 24:55.060]  And then I replied with this.
[24:55.180 --> 24:56.720]  I think this is the perfect cup.
[24:57.080 --> 24:57.980]  Technically a mug.
[24:58.340 --> 24:59.940]  But I think it's the perfect cup.
[25:00.360 --> 25:01.780]  That's immediately what I thought of.
[25:01.980 --> 25:03.340]  Oh, the inverse handle.
[25:03.580 --> 25:06.380]  It's the inverse Ubisoft handle misprint.
[25:06.700 --> 25:09.660]  I don't hear from Geoff until 7.45 p.m.
[25:09.660 --> 25:12.120]  And he replies, huh, I'd have to disagree.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.580]  And then he said,
[25:14.660 --> 25:16.140]  I got a really good cup today.
[25:16.420 --> 25:18.940]  And he sent me a photo of the Zuzu cup.
[25:19.480 --> 25:20.540]  And I replied,
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.860]  What's so good about that cup?
[25:22.100 --> 25:22.960]  He said, lots.
[25:23.580 --> 25:24.900]  I asked, such as?
[25:25.460 --> 25:28.440]  Geoff replies by sending me a 30 second video
[25:28.440 --> 25:30.560]  of him watching a Real Housewives
[25:30.560 --> 25:31.540]  reunion show.
[25:31.980 --> 25:33.840]  Explaining why I should be watching it.
[25:34.120 --> 25:35.580]  Oh, that had nothing to do with the cup.
[25:35.740 --> 25:36.620]  That was an aside.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.260]  Yeah, but it's in the middle.
[25:38.440 --> 25:39.680]  I asked, such as?
[25:39.840 --> 25:42.200]  And then you replied with a 30 second video.
[25:42.620 --> 25:44.300]  I can see how that would be confusing for you.
[25:44.640 --> 25:46.060]  Yeah, no, disregard that.
[25:46.200 --> 25:47.740]  I do think you should be watching the Housewives.
[25:48.540 --> 25:49.620]  Yeah, I'm not opposed.
[25:49.960 --> 25:51.920]  But then he replied, the outfits alone.
[25:52.120 --> 25:54.620]  It's a reunion show, so the outfits are insane.
[25:55.060 --> 25:57.060]  So then I asked, what happened to the cup?
[25:57.300 --> 25:58.140]  And Geoff said, huh?
[25:58.480 --> 26:00.840]  Oh, just thinking about your favorite cup, I guess.
[26:01.160 --> 26:02.940]  I'm thinking we could get into the cup business.
[26:03.180 --> 26:04.780]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[26:04.780 --> 26:06.720]  You just sent me a cup.
[26:06.800 --> 26:08.040]  You asked me what my perfect cup is.
[26:08.280 --> 26:10.780]  You sent me what feels just like a standard cup.
[26:11.080 --> 26:12.320]  And then you're pivoting.
[26:12.620 --> 26:14.260]  It's ridiculous. It's insane.
[26:14.580 --> 26:16.240]  Well, I got a lot going on in my head, man.
[26:16.440 --> 26:17.120]  You did!
[26:18.220 --> 26:19.980]  I'm multi-threaded.
[26:20.840 --> 26:23.100]  The whole story about hating glass
[26:23.100 --> 26:24.520]  was that you just don't like drinking.
[26:24.760 --> 26:25.600]  Like, nothing happened.
[26:26.100 --> 26:27.360]  You just don't like drinking out of a glass.
[26:27.380 --> 26:29.760]  Well, the cup broke, I guess, in the dishwasher.
[26:30.100 --> 26:32.160]  Yeah, I had one of my glasses broke
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.220]  when I was pulling it out of the dishwasher and it sliced my finger open.
[26:35.200 --> 26:36.420]  And then later that day,
[26:36.480 --> 26:38.960]  that was like on Saturday, or Sunday morning,
[26:39.080 --> 26:40.680]  because I got that cup Sunday morning,
[26:41.700 --> 26:42.600]  it was like,
[26:42.840 --> 26:44.000]  that morning I was at
[26:45.260 --> 26:47.280]  the store, or the Zuzu place,
[26:47.420 --> 26:48.620]  and I thought, this is a pretty good cup.
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.000]  And then I thought, why the fuck am I cutting my fingers on glass
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.340]  like an asshole every day
[26:52.340 --> 26:53.760]  when I could just have a...
[26:53.760 --> 26:55.240]  I'm going to take this cup home with me.
[26:55.520 --> 26:57.120]  It was like 99 cents extra.
[26:57.260 --> 26:59.740]  And it's like, fuck, this is so much cheaper
[26:59.740 --> 27:02.120]  and better and safer than a glass.
[27:02.580 --> 27:04.100]  Why am I wasting time with glass?
[27:04.380 --> 27:05.940]  And then it set me on this whole path
[27:05.940 --> 27:08.020]  and Andrew and I got to thinking
[27:08.020 --> 27:10.500]  about it. I don't know what the perfect...
[27:10.500 --> 27:12.260]  Because we're going to invent the perfect cup, right?
[27:12.380 --> 27:14.160]  Yeah. I think that my idea
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.040]  is that the Pizza Hut cup is a starting
[27:16.040 --> 27:18.120]  point for it, because there's a lot
[27:18.120 --> 27:19.640]  going on that's right with it.
[27:19.900 --> 27:22.280]  And then, I want to talk about throwbacks.
[27:22.880 --> 27:24.420]  Dude, that burp tasted so bad.
[27:26.440 --> 27:27.700]  I just grossed myself out.
[27:28.740 --> 27:29.100]  Okay.
[27:30.460 --> 27:33.660]  Yeah, I agree. It was disgusting, Nick.
[27:33.780 --> 27:35.640]  You should have been in my mouth. It's way worse here.
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.560]  We were talking about...
[27:39.560 --> 27:41.500]  We can't do it red, because that's iconic.
[27:41.820 --> 27:43.520]  We should make it gurple, because we already
[27:43.520 --> 27:45.980]  invented our own color. Why not put stuff in gurple?
[27:46.320 --> 27:47.780]  And then, I had the idea
[27:47.780 --> 27:49.520]  we could call it, because Andrew wants it to be big,
[27:49.720 --> 27:52.360]  we could call it the big gurp instead of the big gulp.
[27:52.860 --> 27:53.760]  And yet, Andrew,
[27:53.940 --> 27:55.880]  I think, improved upon that
[27:55.880 --> 27:58.100]  and he said we should call it, Andrew,
[27:58.360 --> 27:58.860]  the gurpler.
[27:59.280 --> 28:02.280]  I don't think there's anything better
[28:02.820 --> 28:03.780]  on earth
[28:03.780 --> 28:05.100]  than the gurpler.
[28:06.180 --> 28:08.200]  So, are we going to make and sell
[28:08.200 --> 28:10.120]  a gurpler? I think we should
[28:10.120 --> 28:11.440]  make and sell a gurpler.
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.420]  But I think we're still in the...
[28:14.420 --> 28:15.740]  Like, we have the name down.
[28:16.040 --> 28:17.360]  We have the color figured out.
[28:17.580 --> 28:20.080]  I think, sort of like when we did the wrist pockets,
[28:20.080 --> 28:22.040]  we should all come up with our own
[28:22.040 --> 28:23.980]  sketch of what would be
[28:23.980 --> 28:26.220]  the perfect cup. And the next episode,
[28:26.480 --> 28:27.480]  we can share this.
[28:28.080 --> 28:28.960]  Exchange notes.
[28:30.420 --> 28:31.840]  Because I have some ideas in my head.
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.340]  I think there's some innovation that the cup game
[28:34.340 --> 28:35.060]  has been lacking.
[28:35.840 --> 28:38.800]  I don't think there's been really any innovation that I can think of
[28:39.500 --> 28:40.480]  in a long time.
[28:41.040 --> 28:41.600]  I would agree.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.140]  The most recent innovation
[28:44.140 --> 28:46.320]  I've seen is putting the handle inside the coffee cup
[28:46.320 --> 28:47.540]  and I don't think that that's working out.
[28:48.780 --> 28:50.440]  That's just great, is what it is.
[28:50.500 --> 28:51.580]  It's in no way effective.
[28:52.740 --> 28:53.820]  I'm into this idea.
[28:54.100 --> 28:55.340]  Yeah, so everybody,
[28:55.760 --> 28:58.020]  we've got most of it figured out.
[28:58.040 --> 28:58.520]  We've got
[28:59.720 --> 29:01.480]  that it's a cup. We know that.
[29:01.860 --> 29:03.840]  We know that it's Gerple.
[29:04.100 --> 29:05.380]  We know that it's called the Gerpler.
[29:05.800 --> 29:07.860]  And it has to hold at least how much water, Andrew?
[29:08.100 --> 29:10.100]  I think a liter. I think it needs to hold a liter of water.
[29:10.600 --> 29:12.280]  I think we have more figured out
[29:12.280 --> 29:13.620]  than most Kickstarters do
[29:13.620 --> 29:16.140]  when they start. And we just have a name
[29:16.140 --> 29:17.740]  and a color. Totally agree.
[29:18.000 --> 29:18.900]  We're on the right path.
[29:19.700 --> 29:21.300]  Anyway, that's why
[29:21.300 --> 29:22.180]  I say fuck glass.
[29:24.240 --> 29:25.120]  My goal
[29:25.120 --> 29:27.040]  is to eliminate glass
[29:27.040 --> 29:29.160]  from houses all across the world
[29:29.160 --> 29:30.740]  and to save people
[29:30.740 --> 29:33.260]  the annoying little bits of glass
[29:33.260 --> 29:35.220]  that end up getting stuck in the bottom of their foot
[29:35.220 --> 29:36.740]  when they go to the fridge at midnight
[29:36.740 --> 29:39.260]  and they realize they didn't clean up that spot
[29:39.260 --> 29:41.060]  or when you go in
[29:41.060 --> 29:43.340]  and then you slice the inside of your fucking hand open
[29:43.340 --> 29:45.200]  trying to pull out a tumbler or a glass
[29:45.200 --> 29:46.620]  out of your dishwasher
[29:46.620 --> 29:47.620]  because it's shattered
[29:47.620 --> 29:49.120]  because it's stupid
[29:49.120 --> 29:51.800]  or when your dog walks by
[29:51.800 --> 29:53.700]  and hits the end of a table
[29:53.700 --> 29:54.680]  and it knocks a glass over
[29:54.680 --> 29:57.240]  and then it shatters because it's stupid
[29:57.240 --> 29:59.940]  I'm trying to fix the world
[29:59.940 --> 30:00.800]  with the Gerpler.
[30:05.990 --> 30:07.850]  Well it seems like online shopping

[30:28.410 --> 30:29.950]  not the kind where you take two celebrities
[30:29.950 --> 30:31.990]  or anime stars and then
[30:31.990 --> 30:33.270]  marry them
[30:33.270 --> 30:35.790]  make the switch to a solution that handles
[30:35.790 --> 30:37.650]  all of your shipping needs quickly

[31:44.050 --> 31:45.970]  Everybody knows relationships take
[31:45.970 --> 31:48.090]  a lot of work. And most of us
[31:48.090 --> 31:50.010]  will drop anything to go help someone
[31:50.010 --> 31:52.210]  we care about. We'll go out of our way
[31:52.210 --> 31:54.130]  to treat the other people in our lives well
[31:54.130 --> 31:56.090]  but how often do we give
[31:56.090 --> 31:57.510]  ourselves the same treatment?
[31:58.150 --> 32:00.070]  Don't forget, we also have
[32:00.070 --> 32:01.910]  relationships with ourselves
[32:01.910 --> 32:04.110]  I have been in therapy for more
[32:04.110 --> 32:05.770]  than a decade myself and I cannot
[32:05.770 --> 32:08.030]  overstate its importance in my life. It has
[32:08.030 --> 32:10.250]  been a literal sanity
[32:10.250 --> 32:12.070]  saver for me. It's helped me work out
[32:12.070 --> 32:14.350]  problems in my personal life, in my
[32:14.350 --> 32:16.290]  work life, it's helped me deal with some stuff
[32:16.290 --> 32:18.510]  from my past, even childhood stuff
[32:18.510 --> 32:20.370]  and it's honestly, it's kind of helped me
[32:20.370 --> 32:22.170]  focus and stay positive. And

[33:15.650 --> 33:16.610]  I spelled it right
[33:18.590 --> 33:19.490]  Did I show you
[33:19.490 --> 33:20.890]  my issue with
[33:20.890 --> 33:22.970]  the issue I had with glass a few months ago?
[33:23.410 --> 33:25.430]  No, I don't think so. I might have sent this
[33:25.430 --> 33:26.450]  to you like privately maybe
[33:26.450 --> 33:29.190]  It was when my cat was
[33:29.190 --> 33:31.210]  sat on my back and we were looking out the window
[33:31.210 --> 33:33.350]  and my cat decided to jump to its
[33:33.350 --> 33:34.930]  little cat treat
[33:34.930 --> 33:36.890]  and it kicked my
[33:36.890 --> 33:39.090]  freaking forehead into the window
[33:47.450 --> 33:49.630]  The footage is great because you just hear like a
[33:49.630 --> 33:50.210]  gong
[33:56.460 --> 33:58.140]  Oh my god
[33:59.040 --> 33:59.960]  Oh god
[33:59.960 --> 34:02.200]  That was the last time my cat sat on my
[34:02.200 --> 34:03.940]  shoulders as we both looked out the window
[34:07.240 --> 34:10.720]  It's such a majestic pose by your cat, too. Like, it just really...
[34:10.720 --> 34:12.820]  You can tell there's some force in that jump.
[34:13.500 --> 34:16.560]  It's like a 14-pound cat, too. He's got some heft behind it.
[34:19.420 --> 34:22.360]  Do you have any idea what it was jumping to? Like, that seems like...
[34:22.360 --> 34:25.040]  Yeah, it was like a little cat tree behind me, where he sits.
[34:25.660 --> 34:26.760]  He was just done being up there.
[34:27.140 --> 34:31.140]  It looks like the type of dive... it looks like an action movie.
[34:31.400 --> 34:34.880]  Like, going for the gun or whatever, the final fight or whatever.
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.540]  Like, needing to get there first. There's determination in that leap.
[34:39.460 --> 34:43.460]  Have you met someone? You know, you meet different people throughout life.
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.240]  People have different names. You meet some people who have the same name.
[34:46.620 --> 34:51.100]  Have you met anyone who you didn't like and then met someone with the same name
[34:51.100 --> 34:52.500]  that you didn't like either?
[34:53.220 --> 34:59.300]  Like, to the point where it's like you're predisposed to sort of be on guard
[34:59.300 --> 35:01.360]  against people who have that name whenever you meet them.
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.260]  Sure. Yeah. There's... yeah. I got one.
[35:06.040 --> 35:06.640]  Throw out a name.
[35:07.380 --> 35:07.760]  Hayden.
[35:09.020 --> 35:09.500]  Hayden?
[35:09.580 --> 35:15.100]  I met one shitty Hayden when I was in 5th grade and I've got a reluctance towards Haydens.
[35:15.440 --> 35:17.440]  But just the one? You're basing it off one bad Hayden?
[35:17.480 --> 35:20.700]  I'm basing it off of one bad Hayden. I've never encountered another one,
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.660]  but that initial meeting, that person would have to overcome the baggage of the last Hayden.
[35:26.300 --> 35:30.420]  I'm working against two bad Lukases.
[35:32.780 --> 35:37.100]  Does it spell with a C or is it like a Lukas with a K?
[35:37.340 --> 35:42.120]  Lukas with a C every time. So if you're a Regulation listener who's called Lukas,
[35:42.820 --> 35:45.900]  you know, nothing personal. I'm sure you're great.
[35:46.120 --> 35:48.880]  But just I've had a couple of bad Lukas experiences.
[35:50.440 --> 35:52.580]  Now, can it be first and or last name?
[35:52.580 --> 35:56.640]  Any Lukas involved at all, that's a warning sign for you at this point?
[35:56.740 --> 35:59.280]  Or is it only if their first name is Lukas spelt with a C?
[36:00.180 --> 36:00.720]  Say that again?
[36:01.240 --> 36:06.840]  Like, let's say George Lukas. Is that a barrier for you? Does it have to be a first name?
[36:07.140 --> 36:08.360]  Yeah, I think it has to be a first name.
[36:08.620 --> 36:12.200]  Okay, and it has to be Lukas spelt specifically L-U-C-A-S.
[36:12.440 --> 36:14.220]  I'm not sure the spelling is as important.
[36:14.820 --> 36:15.480]  Okay, it's the same.
[36:16.200 --> 36:17.700]  Coincidentally, they were both with a C.
[36:17.700 --> 36:19.160]  Oh, Nick says...
[36:21.100 --> 36:25.120]  Nick says, now you mention it, every Lukas I've met was kind of a turd.
[36:26.080 --> 36:28.180]  It can't actually be a Lukas thing.
[36:29.240 --> 36:32.720]  There's no way. I'm determined to meet a nice Lukas.
[36:35.720 --> 36:38.880]  I don't know that I've ever liked an Edward that I've met.
[36:39.820 --> 36:40.140]  Really?
[36:40.460 --> 36:41.560]  That's quite a common name.
[36:42.300 --> 36:42.640]  Yeah.
[36:43.600 --> 36:44.160]  Edward.
[36:45.440 --> 36:45.880]  Huh.
[36:46.760 --> 36:47.920]  I've met some good Eds.
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.480]  Oh, yeah, I'm thinking of people that describe themselves as an Edward and want to be referred to as Edward.
[36:53.740 --> 36:56.060]  Because obviously we have a friend named Ed who's quite lovely.
[36:56.620 --> 36:56.840]  Yeah.
[36:57.360 --> 36:57.780]  Huh.
[36:58.720 --> 37:00.800]  So Hayden, Lukas, and Edward.
[37:02.720 --> 37:03.600]  What a trio.
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.540]  Those are the three people we do not like.
[37:06.740 --> 37:09.480]  I can actually see those three hanging out by name alone.
[37:09.520 --> 37:12.340]  Like if you told me there was a group with Lukas, Hayden, and Edward.
[37:12.640 --> 37:13.320]  That checks out.
[37:13.320 --> 37:18.680]  I hope to God if it doesn't already exist, a Lukas, Hayden, and Edward start a podcast.
[37:20.260 --> 37:35.860]  If you're a regulation f*** face listener, or a comment leaver, or a regulation listener who's looking to promote yourself to a comment leaver, although I would argue it's not a promotion, lateral at best, and you're looking to start a podcast and you have one of those names, put yourself out there.
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.160]  Maybe you guys can all hook up and create the anti-f*** face podcast.
[37:39.620 --> 37:42.520]  I bet you could get the guy who directed the tuxedo to come on your show.
[37:45.060 --> 37:53.440]  Did I ever tell you about the time where I was on a film set and me and another guy both thought we had the same name, but it was neither of our names.
[37:56.800 --> 37:58.120]  What do you mean?
[37:58.120 --> 38:09.620]  Well, I, I was like unpacking Phantom stuff. Like I kind of wasn't paying attention. I assume it was like the, uh, the first AD. So he's like the guy just telling everyone what to do, basically.
[38:10.360 --> 38:16.520]  And he must've been going down the line and meeting people. And I didn't, I guess I didn't know he was doing that.
[38:16.520 --> 38:25.400]  So he must've said something like, Oh, Hey, I'm Jim. Uh, you are. And someone would be like, Oh, Steve. He'd be like, Steve. Uh, Roger. Okay. Roger. Nice to meet you.
[38:25.460 --> 38:33.140]  So he was repeating back everyone, everyone's name back to them, but I wasn't paying attention to that bit. I was just like rummaging around with stuff.
[38:33.220 --> 38:37.820]  So he got to me and, uh, I went Gavin and he goes, Darren.
[38:40.020 --> 38:48.700]  So I thought his name was Darren and he thought my name was Darren, but neither of us were called Darren. He was Jim or something. And I was Gavin.
[38:49.400 --> 38:58.160]  So all day, he kept being like Darren and no one would answer. And if I needed him, I'd be like, Oh, sorry, Darren.
[38:58.160 --> 39:13.280]  And we were just talking to this person in the middle who didn't exist. Just because of one tiny moment of confusion in the morning, it led to so, it was about 4pm by the time where I was like, I'm Gavin, by the way. He's like, Oh, I'm Jim.
[39:15.060 --> 39:21.660]  It was like eight hours of confusion. And as soon as Darren vanished, everything became clear again.
[39:23.840 --> 39:25.220]  Typical Darren behavior.
[39:28.980 --> 39:38.180]  That's impressive. I remember I had, um, it was a family. It was like an extended family dinner and there were people there that I didn't know part of the same family.
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.680]  And one of them, their name was Bryce, but I heard it as Rice. I called him Rice the entire evening.
[39:45.200 --> 39:51.380]  That's not a name. It's not a name. I'm not going to question it. I heard Rice. I just called him Rice the entire time.
[39:52.600 --> 39:58.060]  That's probably like, I don't know, 12, 13. Did he call you out on calling him Rice?
[39:58.300 --> 40:08.700]  No, it never came up once. It's like, Oh my God, I called him Rice all day. His name's Bryce. I don't think I ever saw him again. I think that was the only time I ever encountered Bryce.
[40:08.720 --> 40:09.820]  And now we know why.
[40:11.440 --> 40:18.100]  So your issues with Lucas, are these like serious issues or just like annoyances? Like, I just don't, I don't like this guy.
[40:18.600 --> 40:26.740]  Um, no, I was like sort of bullied by a bloke called Lucas as a kid. And then I just met another bad Lucas and I was like, I'm just, I'm just having bad Lucas luck.
[40:27.060 --> 40:28.160]  Bad Lucas luck.
[40:28.700 --> 40:31.100]  Yeah. Like nothing serious. Just like, ugh.
[40:31.100 --> 40:42.380]  My conflict with Bryce was I bought into the Peter Molyneux hype train. It was my, my Bryce conflict where it was grade five, grade five or grade four. I think it was grade five.
[40:42.620 --> 40:53.860]  And I'd been playing Fable and I was like, Oh, I'm loving Fable. This game is so great. And I was talking about things that Peter Molyneux said were in the game, but weren't actually in the game.
[40:53.860 --> 41:04.340]  And he bought Fable based off of my recommendation, based off of what Peter Molyneux said. And they weren't, the things I said were not in the game. And he was not happy about that.
[41:04.460 --> 41:11.180]  He never let it go. No, he was pissed at me. And he never let it go the entire year. We only had one year together in the same class.
[41:11.400 --> 41:21.740]  And he was mad at me for the whole year because Fable didn't feature the thing that I was talking about. But I thought it did. I didn't know Peter Molyneux was inaccurate about the mechanic of the game.
[41:21.740 --> 41:29.720]  And of all people too, Peter Molyneux is so famous for over hyping. I wonder how you could have made up to him. You could have given him the money back for the game.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.160]  I could have, but it's grade five. I don't have any money. And the fact to hold on to it. It's wild.
[41:35.400 --> 41:45.360]  I was going to make a joke about, like, hey, Lucas Haas, if you're listening, go fuck yourself kind of thing. And then I thought I should look up somebody more famous than Lucas Haas.
[41:45.360 --> 41:51.680]  With a little bit more name recognition. So I looked up most famous Lucases. Guess what? There aren't any.
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.140]  So if your name's Lucas, you can take the stage, pretty much.
[41:56.460 --> 42:03.400]  Yeah, it's wide open. I mean, like, there was Lucas Hartong, the 1963 Dutch politician.
[42:04.580 --> 42:14.120]  The Canadian-American actor Lucas Bryant, who I'm not familiar with. Oh, there you go. Lucas Cronach the Elder. He was a German painter in the 1400s.
[42:14.120 --> 42:20.020]  That's about it. Only actor I can think of is Josh Lucas, but that doesn't even fit the criteria.
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.600]  Yeah. Yeah. Even in sports, I don't know any of these Lucases. A lot of Brazilian football players in the 50s.
[42:26.200 --> 42:34.460]  What about a Luka? Would you be hesitant about a Luka? Gavin, if you encountered Luka Doncic, would you be like, it's close to Lucas. We're getting there. We're halfway there.
[42:34.600 --> 42:39.660]  No, I'd be fine with Luka. OK. Luka Modric, big fan. I don't know who that is.
[42:40.440 --> 42:50.160]  Who's Luka Modric? OK. Huh. I don't. Do you have any name beefs outside Edward? You have Edward. Who, me? Yeah. You have Edward. Is that your one?
[42:50.500 --> 42:56.300]  I have one more, but I don't want to say it because it. That's fair. That might be might be on this call.
[43:00.820 --> 43:05.060]  Really? Anyway, let's move on. There's somebody on this call. What else do you guys want?
[43:05.060 --> 43:11.980]  No, I think that's like we don't need to get into it, but whoever that person is, I think they deserve credit because they overcame the barrier.
[43:12.220 --> 43:16.600]  They are the success story. Hey, I didn't say anybody overcame any barrier.
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.360]  Don't don't look for success where it doesn't exist, buddy. OK, well, let me ask you this.
[43:24.360 --> 43:33.520]  What if it happened to be me? Would a new fridge get me over that barrier? Only if it's delivered by 59 year old William Perry.
[43:36.320 --> 43:42.100]  Eric and Nick, do you have any name beef? I was going to let Nick go first. I don't think I don't think I do.
[43:42.100 --> 43:56.500]  But similar to how you had a guy thought your name was Darren, I had a boss who thought my name was Merrick for like three months. So that was Merrick.
[43:56.720 --> 44:01.820]  Yeah, he called me Merrick and then I don't know, like wrote emails to Merrick.
[44:07.180 --> 44:18.940]  No, I think when I introduced myself, I said, I'm Eric, but I think I probably just said, I'm Eric. And then he just went, Merrick. Yeah, I Merrick.
[44:20.940 --> 44:29.640]  And then I didn't correct him because I didn't understand. Like, I didn't hear him say it wrong. Yeah, it was like three months of him saying it and it got to a point where like I couldn't correct it.
[44:29.640 --> 44:42.380]  But then he found out and he just went, why didn't you tell me? I've been calling you Merrick. And I went, I don't know. I'm sorry. So I so I don't really have name beef. I was just Merrick for a while.
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.620]  We should make a poster someday with Lucas and Merrick and whatever.
[44:49.400 --> 45:01.280]  Or not Lucas. What was the name you were? Dylan or something. What was your fake name? Darren. Darren. Yeah. I don't know how he got Darren out of Gavin. I don't think I can't have. I don't know how I mumbled Gavin into Darren.
[45:01.580 --> 45:13.420]  Was he also British? Yeah. Huh. I wonder if you have a shitty voice. Like, you always will have. You're just a British accent to me, right?
[45:13.420 --> 45:20.020]  Yeah, that's all I like. You're all I hear when I when I talk to you is British accent. I have no I have no way to judge the quality of your accent.
[45:20.200 --> 45:29.620]  But I wonder if I was English, if I'd be like, I hate that guy's fucking voice. He sounds like he's such a nob or whatever. And I don't know. It's compared to other British people. I don't know. All British people sound the same to me.
[45:29.920 --> 45:37.740]  I feel like unless it's atrocious, I have a very hard time determining if an actor is bad, if they're speaking in a different language. Same.
[45:37.740 --> 45:44.040]  If they're a mid tier actor, they seem great to me. If I can't understand if it's in a different it's a language barrier. It's like a shield.
[45:44.460 --> 46:04.660]  Like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins sounded fine. Sounds just like Gavin. Is that the most famous bad British accent of all time? Yeah, but it's like beyond it's beyond that. What about legendary? It's yeah, it's like an accent that you want to try to do because it's so bad.
[46:04.660 --> 46:25.380]  What was Brad Pitt trying to do in Snatch? Because his accent was so bad they just changed the character. I think they wanted him to do Irish at first. Was it Irish? Was that like that was the thing where like he was just trying to do a normal impression and it was so horrendous that they had to like implement his shitty accent into the character that he played.
[46:26.720 --> 46:44.960]  I'm trying to think of other, you know, is a bad one. This is, I think, the most wrong I've ever been about any any piece of content ever. I watched Squid Game maybe like one or two days after it came on the Netflix, probably like five days before Squid Game was a big thing.
[46:44.960 --> 47:09.240]  And I hated it. I just didn't think it was good. And I thought the acting was so bad. I talked to like four or five different people. I was like, hey, you hear about this thing? I watched it. I yeah, I would not recommend it. Didn't enjoy it. And then it became the biggest show like ever. Everybody loves it. I was such an outlier on that. That is the one where even through the accent, I thought the acting was not great. But I'm apparently in a huge minority on that opinion.
[47:09.240 --> 47:13.440]  Are you talking about the main characters or are you talking about the Americans at the end?
[47:14.560 --> 47:36.980]  The main, well, all of it. The Americans are atrocious too. But even the main character, the main guy is like, I just, it's like, I feel like he's super overacting. I just didn't buy his performance. And it was very funny for me to tell like multiple people like, yeah, not great. I wouldn't recommend watching it and then seeing it become like the most universally loved phrased show. I was just so off.
[47:38.620 --> 47:39.980]  Is that your worst content?
[47:40.800 --> 47:48.380]  I think it's the most wrong I think I've ever been about anything in my life is recommending people do not watch Squid Game because I just didn't think it was great.
[47:48.760 --> 47:49.900]  I don't know. You like the Matrix.
[47:50.880 --> 47:55.660]  I did. You know what else is great is the Batman. That's a great movie too. It's a fun one.
[47:55.820 --> 47:56.760]  I watched that last night.
[47:57.260 --> 47:58.260]  Yeah. What do you think of it?
[48:00.320 --> 48:02.940]  Well, yeah, close your ears, Geoff, but I liked it.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.900]  I think it's great. Everybody loves Batman. He's a great character.
[48:06.900 --> 48:08.260]  Great movie. Everyone loves Batman.
[48:08.280 --> 48:15.660]  I've been reading Batman comics since I was about five years old. Batman is super cool. I love Batman. I love Bruce Wayne. I've got hundreds of the comics. I'm a big fan of the franchise.
[48:16.520 --> 48:18.940]  Fantastic movie. It's maybe the best Batman.
[48:19.300 --> 48:21.220]  I mean, there's a lot of great Batmans out there.
[48:21.720 --> 48:28.200]  There's a lot of great Batmans. There's very few bad. You know what? Even the bad Batmans, there's something good to say about the Batmans.
[48:28.440 --> 48:28.720]  Sure.
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.340]  Like, I feel like Batman and Robin, famously bad Batman movie. George Clooney, pretty good Bruce Wayne.
[48:34.940 --> 48:35.920]  George Clooney, great Bruce Wayne.
[48:35.920 --> 48:39.160]  I could take from that. Great Bruce Wayne. Fantastic Bruce Wayne.
[48:39.520 --> 48:46.760]  Yeah, a lot of good things to be said about Batman as a character, the franchise, the comics, the games.
[48:46.980 --> 48:48.460]  Some great Batman games.
[48:48.780 --> 48:55.560]  Maybe we should get out of the requirement that Batman has to be the same actor as Bruce Wayne.
[48:56.540 --> 48:59.060]  That's what I was thinking. I had that thought the other day.
[48:59.520 --> 49:04.060]  What if Robert Pattinson took off the mask and it was just George Clooney underneath?
[49:04.500 --> 49:09.920]  Would that be jarring? You know who I feel like would be really good Bruce Wayne? Maybe even a Batman. Jon Hamm.
[49:10.400 --> 49:12.520]  I could see Jon Hamm as a good Bruce Wayne.
[49:13.320 --> 49:16.660]  He's got that jawline. He's got a good Batman jawline.
[49:17.020 --> 49:17.960]  Looks good in a castle.
[49:23.510 --> 49:25.230]  He's got castle vibes, for sure.
[49:25.250 --> 49:27.470]  There are some people who just have the face for a mansion.
[49:27.950 --> 49:33.890]  Like, if I stand in the middle of a mansion, I'm clearly visiting a rich friend. I'm clearly not supposed to be there.
[49:33.890 --> 49:38.030]  Just because of my face. But Jon Hamm, I'd buy that.
[49:41.250 --> 49:47.970]  He is the celebrity spokesperson for a Canadian food delivery service called Skip the Dishes.
[49:48.330 --> 49:50.110]  So I see Jon Hamm quite a bit on TV.
[49:50.790 --> 49:55.050]  It's always funny when celebrities have local or country-specific advertising deals.
[49:55.410 --> 49:58.550]  I noticed that. Do you know who you see a lot of in England? Kevin Bacon.
[49:59.390 --> 50:01.150]  Really? What's he doing?
[50:01.810 --> 50:02.590]  He's all over TV.
[50:03.450 --> 50:07.850]  Just doing ads? Or is he like the spokesperson for a specific company?
[50:07.870 --> 50:13.470]  It might be a specific thing. I just kept walking past my mum's living room and just seeing him on TV.
[50:13.690 --> 50:15.050]  I don't think I saw what he was advertising.
[50:15.430 --> 50:17.830]  Anyone who's in the UK could let us know in the comments, though.
[50:18.550 --> 50:21.430]  From a listener to a comment leaver, then. Feel free.
[50:21.850 --> 50:23.770]  It's like that trip we took to England.
[50:24.450 --> 50:29.350]  I mean, we've been to England together a few times, but the big one where we went on the two-week vacation and we drove up to Scotland and all.
[50:29.350 --> 50:32.390]  That was, I don't know, around 2010, maybe?
[50:33.430 --> 50:38.810]  I felt like the entire country of England was only Iggy Pop and Run-DMC.
[50:39.270 --> 50:45.450]  And I was like, what fucking year is it? It's like 2010. What the hell is going on?
[50:45.710 --> 50:48.950]  Iggy Pop, Run-DMC, Iggy Pop, Run-DMC, everywhere you look.
[50:49.710 --> 50:54.050]  I'm assuming it's not the case anymore, but that was a weird, weird point in time.
[50:54.050 --> 50:58.510]  Do you think the reverse of that is somebody being like, all they fucking do is have Shaq on TV?
[50:58.630 --> 51:00.650]  He's selling me everything. He's selling me cars, lotion.
[51:01.750 --> 51:03.510]  Shaq, I feel like, is the American equivalent.
[51:03.650 --> 51:04.290]  Sell me insurance.
[51:04.910 --> 51:06.410]  Yeah, he's in every ad.
[51:07.130 --> 51:11.050]  Tommy Lee Jones is that for Japan. Tommy Lee Jones has so many great Japanese commercials.
[51:11.650 --> 51:12.070]  Oh, really?
[51:12.730 --> 51:15.270]  You haven't seen a Tommy Lee Jones Japanese commercial?
[51:16.070 --> 51:19.250]  They're fucking wild. They're coffee commercials, I think.
[51:19.510 --> 51:22.630]  If somebody... maybe I'll try to pull it up. I'll post it in the chat.
[51:22.630 --> 51:28.450]  There's like compilations online. It's like Tommy Lee Jones drinking a coffee and then turning into an eagle.
[51:28.570 --> 51:29.870]  It's just like what he's been doing.
[51:30.110 --> 51:30.870]  Oh, man.
[51:31.830 --> 51:32.230]  Insane.
[51:32.750 --> 51:36.070]  That reminds me. I read an article yesterday.
[51:37.410 --> 51:41.150]  It was a little while ago. I mean, this happened a little while ago, but I read it yesterday.
[51:41.470 --> 51:50.870]  Apparently, a bunch of American actors host shows in Russia on Russian state TV because they can't get people in Russia who want to host them.
[51:50.870 --> 51:59.110]  So I guess William Shatner for a while hosted a talk show in Russia on Russian state-run TV.
[52:00.530 --> 52:00.550]  Damn.
[52:01.130 --> 52:02.650]  Yeah, I don't know if he still does or not.
[52:03.150 --> 52:07.590]  But I guess they had import hosts in because they were having... I don't know why. I don't want to get into politics.
[52:08.050 --> 52:13.130]  But isn't that bizarre that William Shatner hosts a TV show in Russia, of all places?
[52:13.330 --> 52:15.770]  It's the hope that just people don't ever find that stuff.
[52:15.770 --> 52:24.610]  I mean, I just looked it up and the article was from summer of 2021. So I guess people don't find it.
[52:24.770 --> 52:27.250]  I just watched Tommy Lee Jones laser something.
[52:27.970 --> 52:29.110]  What is happening?
[52:32.090 --> 52:33.810]  I'll post another compilation.
[52:34.150 --> 52:36.330]  I'd love to know how much you got paid for this.
[52:36.870 --> 52:43.430]  Oh, he makes so many. It's not just that. There are countless Tommy Lee Jones coffee commercials that are fucking crazy.
[52:43.430 --> 52:47.410]  Isn't this pretty much the point of Lost in Translation, right?
[52:48.430 --> 52:49.650]  Is it? I've never seen it.
[52:49.650 --> 52:51.810]  It's not like Bill Murray went over and did some... you guys never seen it?
[52:52.070 --> 52:54.650]  Like he was an American actor who went over and did commercials and weird shit.
[52:54.990 --> 52:55.090]  Oh.
[52:56.070 --> 52:56.650]  Is that a good movie?
[52:57.190 --> 53:04.190]  Yeah, I remember liking it a lot. I probably am fucking up the plot terribly, but I remember really enjoying it.
[53:05.630 --> 53:06.490]  It's early 2000s.
[53:07.290 --> 53:08.550]  Early, yeah. That's a good way to describe it.
[53:10.070 --> 53:12.870]  I was trying to think of an actor more so than this.
[53:12.870 --> 53:16.370]  Tommy Lee Jones, very recognizable. He's in some big movies.
[53:16.870 --> 53:18.870]  I am completely indifferent to him.
[53:19.070 --> 53:21.950]  And I've never heard anybody say they love Tommy Lee Jones.
[53:22.550 --> 53:23.430]  I love Tommy Lee Jones.
[53:23.810 --> 53:27.090]  Really? You're the guy? You're a Tommy Lee Jones fan?
[53:27.570 --> 53:27.850]  I'm a guy.
[53:27.850 --> 53:29.910]  He's just really good in everything he's in.
[53:30.570 --> 53:37.050]  He's solid, but I've never heard anyone be like, oh, I'm excited or I'm going to see this based on the fact that he is in this.
[53:37.390 --> 53:39.690]  And he's got like a crusty old wisdom face.
[53:40.470 --> 53:41.150]  He does.
[53:41.770 --> 53:48.870]  Dude, Tommy Lee Jones in No Country for Old Men is one of the best performances I've ever seen in my life.
[53:48.970 --> 53:52.510]  I'm apparently just way off. People like Tommy Lee Jones way more than I realized.
[53:52.850 --> 53:55.870]  I was going through his IMDb because he's just a fugitive.
[53:56.350 --> 53:58.770]  I feel like he's in movies that you just haven't heard of.
[53:59.030 --> 53:59.590]  I've been playing this.
[54:00.510 --> 54:01.890]  I mean, this is a classic.
[54:02.070 --> 54:02.770]  Captain America?
[54:05.430 --> 54:08.090]  You're right. Yeah, these are some real duds.
[54:08.270 --> 54:09.350]  Some obscure shit.
[54:10.910 --> 54:14.330]  No, I'm saying, listen, I'm not saying everything he's done is obscure.
[54:14.810 --> 54:17.810]  But I feel like he's somebody that you have a catalog of or you look at.
[54:17.890 --> 54:19.530]  He's made like 200 or whatever movies.
[54:19.770 --> 54:21.930]  And it's like, what the fuck is this?
[54:22.930 --> 54:26.750]  I wonder what percentage of his films he remembers.
[54:26.990 --> 54:29.110]  Like if you sat him down and said, name every movie you were in.
[54:29.390 --> 54:32.530]  Do you think he'd get 50% or more?
[54:32.770 --> 54:33.590]  I bet not.
[54:34.430 --> 54:37.350]  I mean, think of it this way, and I know this is a totally different, but...
[54:38.030 --> 54:44.090]  How many old Achievement Hunter videos do you see popping up on social media or Reddit that have you in them?
[54:44.230 --> 54:47.030]  That you click on that you feel like you're watching for the first time?
[54:48.210 --> 54:49.390]  Oh yeah, it happens quite a lot.
[54:49.650 --> 54:53.130]  Same with stuff I've worked on too.
[54:54.130 --> 54:57.410]  I always used to wonder why people couldn't remember the stuff they've been in.
[54:57.650 --> 54:59.730]  An actor on a film, it's like, how do you remember that?
[54:59.750 --> 55:01.370]  It must have taken up a big chunk of your life.
[55:01.750 --> 55:06.690]  But I couldn't name probably more than 20% of the commercials that I worked on.
[55:07.530 --> 55:09.950]  Because it was probably like 200 or something.
[55:10.410 --> 55:13.110]  And all of it's gone straight out of my head.
[55:13.310 --> 55:17.510]  And those were like long days on set, you know, meeting people, calling people Darren.
[55:17.930 --> 55:19.370]  It's like a big part of my life.
[55:23.710 --> 55:28.870]  I was looking through Tommy Lee Jones' IMDb and just seeing like things that...
[55:28.870 --> 55:35.450]  I feel like actors of that era especially are in just insane, like kind of 70s, 80s, ridiculous plots.
[55:35.450 --> 55:37.030]  I was like, can I find something weird?
[55:37.390 --> 55:40.630]  There's a movie where Tommy Lee Jones just plays a character named Tom Lee.
[55:41.270 --> 55:42.210]  I was like, that's odd.
[55:42.810 --> 55:48.090]  And so I looked into it and every actor is just playing a character with the same name essentially.
[55:48.430 --> 55:50.090]  But there's an exception to that.
[55:50.530 --> 55:52.450]  I thought this was very funny. I was looking through the list.
[55:53.910 --> 55:55.750]  Elizabeth Mormon as Eliza.
[55:55.950 --> 55:57.370]  It's like, I can see the extension there.
[55:57.710 --> 56:00.850]  Tommy Lee Jones playing Tommy Lee as Tom Lee Jones.
[56:01.410 --> 56:04.050]  Rose Kuang as Rose Kuang, Chinese astrologer.
[56:04.050 --> 56:07.290]  Then Marcel Sabourin, pervert doctor.
[56:10.970 --> 56:12.430]  What movie is that?
[56:13.250 --> 56:15.010]  I don't remember what it was called.
[56:15.130 --> 56:17.270]  It was very early in his career.
[56:18.050 --> 56:21.690]  Do you think on the call sheet his character's name was like Dr. Steve?
[56:21.930 --> 56:24.110]  And then he saw the credits and was like...
[56:24.110 --> 56:25.790]  Dr. Marcel!
[56:26.110 --> 56:29.630]  Well, what makes it even funnier to me is the guy below him is Richard Manuel.
[56:30.050 --> 56:31.610]  Richard Bearded Composer.
[56:31.610 --> 56:33.630]  So they gave him a name and a profession.
[56:34.170 --> 56:36.030]  He just gets pervert doctor.
[56:45.390 --> 56:47.790]  Wow, I learned a lot. I learned about Kevin Bacon.
[56:48.170 --> 56:49.650]  I'm excited to do a cup.
[56:50.470 --> 56:52.250]  I have ideas in my mind already.
[56:52.450 --> 56:56.210]  So are we collaborating on the same cup or are we doing individual cup designs?
[56:56.390 --> 56:58.250]  No, I think we should all do our own designs.
[56:58.790 --> 57:02.190]  And then maybe there's something in your cup that I didn't even consider.
[57:02.190 --> 57:04.970]  I think if we're going to really flesh out this cup concept,
[57:06.050 --> 57:10.410]  we should get a bunch of cups on the table and see what we like and dislike from the various designs.
[57:10.750 --> 57:12.170]  Alright, I got some ideas.
[57:12.170 --> 57:12.650]  I got a hard one.
[57:13.550 --> 57:15.190]  You think it's hard? Really?
[57:15.390 --> 57:17.110]  Just... I'd go with this.
[57:17.410 --> 57:20.210]  Just remember, simpler is better, typically.
[57:21.770 --> 57:24.530]  We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, we're trying to reinvent the cup.
[57:25.470 --> 57:28.190]  Well, is there anything simple about the wrist pocket?
[57:29.510 --> 57:32.630]  I mean, what's complicated or complex about that?
[57:32.730 --> 57:34.450]  It couldn't be more simple.
[57:35.030 --> 57:36.350]  Also, we're on the topic of wrist pockets.
[57:36.490 --> 57:37.850]  Are we selling more wrist pockets?
[57:38.170 --> 57:39.270]  Are we going to do more of that?
[57:39.530 --> 57:41.370]  We don't have any plans currently. Why do you ask?
[57:41.950 --> 57:45.910]  Well, it's just... we made a thousand Tiki Mugs and we did 50 wrist pockets.
[57:45.950 --> 57:47.310]  I don't understand the ratio.
[57:47.730 --> 57:48.750]  There were only 50?
[57:49.110 --> 57:50.370]  There were 50 of them.
[57:50.470 --> 57:52.650]  Technically, there were 49 because I lost.
[57:52.710 --> 57:55.750]  49 of them? We did a thousand Tiki Mugs.
[57:55.810 --> 57:56.970]  I don't understand the ratio.
[57:56.970 --> 57:58.790]  We must have lost money on that.
[58:00.750 --> 58:03.650]  I don't know. I think we made money. Hopefully.
[58:04.050 --> 58:05.450]  I know that the people loved them.
[58:05.730 --> 58:15.430]  I know that a lot of hard work and love and sweat and tears and effort went into making the 49 special cards that I inserted into all of them.
[58:15.490 --> 58:23.650]  And the person who got the one-of-one uniform card already reached out and I've already put them in touch with the RT store and they're getting one of everything we have.
[58:23.650 --> 58:26.990]  You sent me a video of someone unboxing one and it was phenomenal.
[58:28.150 --> 58:28.510]  Phenomenal.
[58:28.810 --> 58:29.910]  Should we put that? Should we link that?
[58:30.330 --> 58:32.950]  Yeah, we absolutely should. I think we probably already did, but we'll do it here too as well.
[58:34.070 --> 58:38.370]  Yeah, that dude who did... it was awesome. He did a great job. He top-loaded it. Everything was very funny.
[58:38.790 --> 58:40.510]  Showed off how practical the wrist pocket was.
[58:40.510 --> 58:44.790]  And it was so dry and not tongue-in-cheek. That's why I loved it.
[58:45.190 --> 58:46.830]  I'll show you. I had a premise.
[58:47.450 --> 58:51.910]  While Geoff and I were talking about the cups, Gavin, this randomly popped in my head.
[58:51.910 --> 58:57.210]  Because I was thinking about the wrist pockets. I would love to have one, but we only made 50, so they're very hard to get.
[58:57.690 --> 59:05.870]  Do you remember... have you seen a season of Survivor, Gavin, where they've done the challenge where it's like three people in each tribe have a bar across their shoulders?
[59:06.230 --> 59:10.250]  And they put sandbags on it and whoever can last the longest wins immunity.
[59:10.530 --> 59:12.370]  But that week, it's more of an old challenge.
[59:12.490 --> 59:13.330]  I don't think I saw that one.
[59:14.010 --> 59:18.310]  Oh, well, this is... I want Geoff to recreate this with the wrist pockets.
[59:20.030 --> 59:23.690]  I want to see how many pockets it would take to take down Geoff.
[59:24.730 --> 59:27.250]  That is awesome. We should definitely do that.
[59:27.690 --> 59:31.030]  If there is enough demand, the audience has to want it, though.
[59:31.430 --> 59:36.030]  I will absolutely do this Survivor challenge with wrist pockets. Oh my god.
[59:36.550 --> 59:43.350]  Because you just did that stream, the everything must go go now, which I haven't had a chance to watch yet, but I can't wait to do so.
[59:43.470 --> 59:45.970]  I don't know that you'll have a chance to watch it.
[59:45.970 --> 59:49.450]  It is. It's on VOD. It's already on the site. It's available.
[59:49.630 --> 59:50.790]  I wasn't aware we were doing that.
[59:51.530 --> 01:00:00.850]  Yes, well, it's there, but could it be like a thing where every wrist pocket sold or something gets added to your poll and that's just how you end up with...
[01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:01.510]  That's funny.
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.630]  Like some sort of translation of trying to take down Geoff.
[01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:06.650]  That's funny. That's funny. Yeah.
[01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:12.990]  It's like how you buy a pair of Bomba socks and they donate a pair of socks to a homeless person or whatever.
[01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:17.570]  It's like if you buy one, it donates one to my pain.
[01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:19.310]  What gets put in the bag?
[01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.350]  Sand.
[01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:24.290]  Oh, you know what we could put? The freaking dirt from the hole.
[01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:29.910]  You're only going to be able to fill three wrist pockets with your puny ass tiny hole.
[01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:32.230]  That's a whole mound out there.
[01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:37.910]  We're on to something here. Glass. Fuck you. We are on to something here. That's great.
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.930]  That might be an angle to bring the wrist pocket back.
[01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:43.490]  Although I'm not in a hurry to do a stream like the everything must go go now.
[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.990]  It was fun, but easily the hardest I have ever worked in my life.
[01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:51.630]  I love the idea of us selling the dirt from your backyard.
[01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:57.150]  Let's get a pH sample so we can say what's in it.
[01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:02.290]  You ought to hit a quota this month. Geoff's just covered in dirt.
[01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:06.450]  I have to buy a new house.
[01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:15.030]  We're selling too well. I wonder if we can sell enough wrist pockets to justify me getting a pool.
[01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:27.630]  There's something so great about the money being made to like pay for your pool and simultaneously getting rid of the dirt from the hole.
[01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.510]  I was thinking more of the dirt, not the money, but yeah.
[01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:34.010]  Oh my God, we should probably wrap up then.
[01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:38.510]  I will say real quick, I just want to give you guys one piece of good news in my life because there aren't many.
[01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:41.930]  I'm riding my bike every day again.
[01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:44.330]  Nice! That's awesome.
[01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:46.730]  It's working great. I got a new seat and that fixed everything.
[01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:49.370]  Wonderful. I'm so happy to hear that.
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.270]  I still don't have my new bike yet because that was a five month delay.
[01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:58.230]  I made the old bike work and it's been awesome and there's been no butt pain.
[01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:04.890]  Although, while I got my root canals done, you know that was interesting.
[01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:10.650]  I learned that you can get nitrous, like the gas, that makes it go a lot faster and a lot easier.
[01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:12.050]  And so that helped.
[01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.650]  But yeah, my mouth is fine.
[01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:21.690]  I gotta go back in six months, the guy said that if I have any pain or discomfort to let him know and he will pull it and then we will burn it.
[01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:22.870]  Or shoot it in his face.
[01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:24.790]  But there's no saving it at this point.
[01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:26.770]  It's his last chance.
[01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:27.710]  This is it.
[01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:28.630]  It's on probation.
[01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:30.830]  I got tooth probation on this guy.
[01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:36.970]  The only weird thing is that I was visited by the gentle ghost again.
[01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:38.370]  Oh no.
[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:39.070]  Yeah.
[01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:40.530]  Not the gentle... no.
[01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:41.630]  That's not good.
[01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:47.890]  I sprained my ankle when I was visited by the gentle ghost in the exact same spot.
[01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:53.850]  Like the exact same spot where the ghost pushed me down the first time, the ghost pushed me down again.
[01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.390]  Except this time I hurt more.
[01:02:55.730 --> 01:03:02.070]  And I got to thinking, what if it's not a ghost, although I'm still really open and receptive to that possibility.
[01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.990]  What if there's a... you know, have you guys heard of vortexes?
[01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.290]  Like supposedly Sedona, Arizona is all vortexes, right?
[01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:15.830]  What if that... what if I have found an Austin, Texas localized mini vortex and it just happens to be at a crosswalk?
[01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.230]  I think we should investigate.
[01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:27.190]  It's got to be just like a breeze, like something about the highway nearby or something is just causing some sort of breeze.
[01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:31.270]  I'm telling you, it's not a breeze, it was a ghost or a vortex.
[01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:39.050]  I know it's not what you mean, but every time you say vortex, I think of that Nerf vortex football and it just gets me excited.
[01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.190]  What a great product that was.
[01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:46.410]  Do you want to feel like a professional athlete? Go grab a vortex. You can throw it 600 yards, it whistles.
[01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:48.330]  What happened to those? Are they still in production?
[01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.470]  I have no idea, but they're amazing. I'd love to have one.
[01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.410]  I want to see which one of us can throw a vortex football the farthest.
[01:03:54.610 --> 01:04:00.070]  I would, yeah. I want to see the translation of your fastball, which you still have to do again.
[01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.210]  You have to set a second number at some point.
[01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:06.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get there. I just got... we had bean holes to dig, we got 350 baseballs to hit.
[01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:10.330]  Apparently I have to hold a swimming pool worth of dirt on my shoulders.
[01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:12.810]  There's a lot ahead of us.
[01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:17.450]  Do you think you could hold the amount of dirt we dug out of the hole in its current state?
[01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.230]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:20.550]  Really?
[01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.350]  Hold on, I can look at this.
[01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:24.790]  Without a doubt.
[01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:26.070]  Be right back.
[01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:29.290]  Is he going to go look?
[01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:34.430]  He said for sure, and then immediately went back.
[01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:36.330]  It's quite a lot of dirt, you know.
[01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:37.130]  Right.
[01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:41.810]  I do think that it's more dirt than he probably thought it was.
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:47.550]  But to say for sure, and then go, well, is really something.
[01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.890]  So not for sure at all.
[01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:51.370]  Not for sure. I'll say this, it'll be close.
[01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:52.810]  It'll be close.
[01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:57.770]  That image that you post looks like you're attacking him.
[01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:02.250]  It looked like you made him bury his own grave, and he got that far.
[01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:05.270]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:07.690]  Nobody's digging graves.
[01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:08.850]  Nobody.
[01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:15.610]  I want that reconstructed, but it's just your foot in the hole, and it's buried.
[01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:19.950]  We should get that drawn out as a logo.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:21.890]  Like a very simple NBA style.
[01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.590]  Like the Ian face drawn out.
[01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.890]  If anyone asks me what this show is, I'm just going to show them the picture.
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.290]  Oh my god, I ordered something so cool the other day.
[01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:35.050]  We have to end the episode.
[01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:37.670]  I know we're ending, and I'm going to end too.
[01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:46.970]  But as I was numbering all those cards that I stamped and then hand numbered for the wrist pockets,
[01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.870]  I thought, if I do this again, I want to improve each time.
[01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:50.450]  I want it to get better.
[01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:55.950]  So I got Tony and the Ecom guys to buy me a gold foil stamper.
[01:05:56.370 --> 01:06:03.930]  It looks like a giant drill press, and it heats up a gold foil, and then you put in brass plates of numbers.
[01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:07.290]  It's very heavy, very unwieldy, but it works like a charm.
[01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:12.230]  And I was able to make golden numbers now, but I'm not satisfied with numbers,
[01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:15.390]  so I found this place on Etsy that makes custom designs,
[01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:21.290]  and so I've ordered a bunch of custom Ian brass plates so I can put the face on stuff.
[01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:23.250]  Oh, the official f*** face seal.
[01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:24.810]  Yeah, the official f*** face seal.
[01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:30.610]  I was going to do the f*** face logo, but I didn't want to have the conversation with the very sweet old lady who was making it.
[01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:32.090]  So I just said, how about this instead?
[01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:34.290]  And she was like, I don't get it, but okay.
[01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:40.070]  We're talking about different, increasing the absurdity,
[01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:46.630]  because this all started, the first thing you marked with was a torch, right? Like a blowtorch type thing?
[01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:47.830]  What were you using?
[01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.230]  Oh, that was a wood burner.
[01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:52.530]  A wood engraver. I still have that, but I'm not going to use it on cards.
[01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.410]  Yeah, you had an engraver, and then you had the wood burner,
[01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:56.410]  and now you have a f*** printing press in your house,
[01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:00.990]  and it's just, I want this evolution to continue to the point, I don't know how they make these,
[01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:06.850]  if we could somehow get a signature on a tire tread, I just want you driving over a line of things with a wheelchair.
[01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:08.850]  Oh, that's a great idea! Dude, can I tell you?
[01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:15.650]  I had a, the other day, unironically, without hyperbole, I had a conversation with Emily when I was looking at the heat press,
[01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:19.250]  I was trying to figure out where to store it, and I thought, I went to Emily and I said, I think we need to buy a bigger house,
[01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:23.110]  I need a room, I need a room for all the f*** face devices.
[01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.410]  So I'm going to be looking into that.
[01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:28.570]  Why don't you just build a f*** face shed?
[01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:32.890]  Well, half my backyard's a hole now.
[01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.150]  And you're going to have to build up from that ground.
[01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:37.690]  Because it's impenetrable.
[01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.450]  The dirt he has in his backyard.
[01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.370]  I think we're halfway to digging the official f*** face bunker.
[01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.310]  And that's where it will be.
[01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:48.190]  That's a lot of rocks we've got to move.
[01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.010]  Thanks for listening, assholes!
[01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:52.310]  Love ya!
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:54.930]  Is that the real ending?
[01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:56.290]  I don't know.
[01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:59.270]  Eric's going to get mad if we don't end, he keeps saying what is happening in the episode.
[01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:00.450]  Do a nice ending.
[01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.870]  Well, it's that time again.
[01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:21.070]  You've spent the last, oh, I don't know, depending on editing hour to hour and five minutes laughing and learning and maybe crying a little bit and being challenged emotionally and mentally and coming out the other side maybe a little wiser, a little tougher and maybe a little better mood.
[01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.450]  And we sure hope that was the case at least.
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:26.410]  Because it definitely was for some of us.
[01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.470]  Not all of us, you know who we're talking about.
[01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:42.830]  If you liked the episode or even if it was just eh, but you didn't hate it, why don't you go ahead and give us a review or a like or a positive thing or mail some stars to us or put some star stickers on shit around town and write **** face on them.
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:45.510]  Whatever you want to do, we sure would appreciate it.
[01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:50.270]  And don't forget, this is a family-friendly Apple Bagel podcast.
[01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:52.590]  So if you want your mom or your grandma to listen to it.
[01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:55.190]  Does your grandmother or mother know about butt plugs?
[01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.730]  If they don't, I have a gentle way to introduce them to it.
[01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.710]  Through the eyes of Andrew's own mother.
[01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:02.770]  So uh, yeah.
[01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:04.710]  Why don't you bring them in next time, next Wednesday.
[01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:07.270]  Sit them down and say, Gammy, let's listen in.
[01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.010]  Bye.
[01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:12.870]  Hey guys, minor league fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of **** face.
[01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:14.790]  It's Geoffrey at the bat.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.690]  The balls have been signed.
[01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:18.970]  Maybe beanhole wasn't a good idea.
[01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:20.810]  Andrew wants a tiny fridge.
[01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.930]  The **** face cup is much bigger.
[01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.930]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.910]  All that and more on next week's episode of **** face.
