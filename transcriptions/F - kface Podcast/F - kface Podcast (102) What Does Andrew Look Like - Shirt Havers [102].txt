[00:05.080 --> 00:06.500]  Previously on F*** Face.
[00:17.360 --> 00:18.840]  Oh, I got it, my beard.
[00:19.160 --> 00:20.400]  My beard is all beefy.
[00:20.700 --> 00:21.200]  You have a beard?
[00:21.400 --> 00:21.700]  I have a beefy beard.
[00:21.920 --> 00:22.440]  Yeah, hold on.
[00:22.500 --> 00:23.340]  Let's get into the podcast.
[00:23.940 --> 00:28.020]  Hello and welcome to episode 102 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:28.340 --> 00:29.400]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:29.520 --> 00:31.700]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.960]  This is, just for posterity's sake, this is year two, season four.
[00:36.380 --> 00:38.080]  Andrew, you have a beard?
[00:38.080 --> 00:39.920]  Yeah, I have a beard currently.
[00:40.060 --> 00:41.680]  I don't know what you look like.
[00:41.740 --> 00:44.240]  My mental image is never, never right.
[00:44.300 --> 00:47.740]  You need to describe yourself every month just so I've got a good mental image.
[00:47.800 --> 00:50.200]  Yeah, OK, well, it's the same as before.
[00:50.340 --> 00:51.080]  I have short hair.
[00:51.280 --> 00:52.340]  That's that's still the same.
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.580]  And I have a beard currently.
[00:53.760 --> 00:55.720]  How long is the beard? Is it like a jack beard?
[00:56.040 --> 00:57.520]  No, it's like a small.
[00:57.820 --> 01:00.500]  It's not. It's it's a it's a very mediocre beard.
[01:00.720 --> 01:01.400]  It's not a great beard.
[01:01.460 --> 01:03.300]  Full coverage or is it like trimmed areas?
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.020]  It's full coverage, but it's just not like super full.
[01:06.260 --> 01:07.440]  It's not a great beard.
[01:07.440 --> 01:09.040]  You don't sound like you have a beard.
[01:09.340 --> 01:12.100]  I do. I can tell you, I can smell it right now.
[01:12.260 --> 01:15.540]  I got Bovril in it from the pop and it is not good.
[01:16.360 --> 01:18.380]  A beefy beard right now. It smells terrible.
[01:18.780 --> 01:20.860]  Bovril smells worse than it tastes.
[01:21.220 --> 01:23.000]  Yeah, I think I'd agree with that. In my experience.
[01:23.180 --> 01:28.480]  Having had salad cream prior to that, it being frozen made it so much worse.
[01:28.700 --> 01:32.800]  I had something about the smell and the texture, not even froze, just super cold.
[01:32.920 --> 01:34.520]  It wasn't it wasn't frozen at all.
[01:34.600 --> 01:35.680]  What did it do to the texture?
[01:35.800 --> 01:37.180]  Did it make it more congealed?
[01:37.180 --> 01:39.340]  Was it more solid or was it just very cold?
[01:39.560 --> 01:40.980]  It was more congealed.
[01:41.140 --> 01:44.980]  It felt more solid and just it has such a strong taste.
[01:45.100 --> 01:46.780]  And it's just so overpowering.
[01:47.340 --> 01:48.020]  That was gross.
[01:48.640 --> 01:53.180]  I hate that we did frozen pops and my favorite beverage of cold, my cold,
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.460]  my cold beverage of choice, Coke, was the one that wasn't picked.
[01:57.180 --> 02:00.880]  The only my favorite cold thing was the one that was left off.
[02:01.240 --> 02:05.680]  Oh, you know, I will say through the course of spending that week in the UK
[02:05.680 --> 02:08.660]  and then going to that community meetup, I talked to a lot of people.
[02:09.280 --> 02:11.400]  Bovril, pretty universally not loved.
[02:11.780 --> 02:16.940]  But every single person to a fault loves salad cream and Branson pickle.
[02:17.220 --> 02:18.720]  Hell, you couldn't say enough good things about them.
[02:18.800 --> 02:21.000]  Yeah, they were very, very popular over there, apparently.
[02:21.220 --> 02:22.800]  I'm so glad I didn't go with Branson pickle.
[02:22.900 --> 02:25.240]  That was a consideration of one of the ice pop flavors.
[02:25.520 --> 02:27.560]  Frozen Branson pickle would be very interesting.
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.360]  I wasn't sure if I'd be able to freeze it with the texture of it
[02:31.360 --> 02:32.140]  and like the contents.
[02:32.180 --> 02:33.720]  I wasn't sure how that would equal out.
[02:33.860 --> 02:35.380]  But salad cream certainly didn't work.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.580]  Well, I think we have some new recipes for the face cooks.
[02:39.660 --> 02:41.740]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[02:42.120 --> 02:43.500]  Cookbook when we finally make it.
[02:43.540 --> 02:46.020]  So since we do you want to you want to ask your questions now,
[02:46.020 --> 02:48.980]  since it's fresh in your mind, another episode, another two guesses for you both.
[02:49.220 --> 02:50.680]  Yeah. Gavin, you go first.
[02:51.040 --> 02:52.720]  Was this person in fluke face?
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.740]  No. Oh, shit.
[02:55.540 --> 02:56.340]  Oh, God.
[02:56.700 --> 02:57.900]  You need to come up with like a list.
[02:58.440 --> 02:59.060]  Possible people.
[02:59.400 --> 03:01.020]  Do you have a question, Geoff, that you'd like to ask?
[03:01.060 --> 03:02.980]  Then maybe it will help Gavin with his guess.
[03:03.200 --> 03:04.740]  I can't. I'm struggling.
[03:04.740 --> 03:07.000]  I'm struggling to remember what we've already asked.
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.200]  I want to ask, but I'm scared.
[03:08.300 --> 03:09.000]  I've already asked.
[03:09.280 --> 03:12.180]  OK, if they're related to if they're like one of the online lawyers,
[03:12.300 --> 03:14.020]  if they're related to that whole segment.
[03:14.180 --> 03:17.920]  I don't I also don't remember if you've asked that, but I'll just say no, they're not.
[03:18.040 --> 03:18.680]  OK, OK.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.360]  Oh, I might have to give another clue out with the rate we're currently going.
[03:22.460 --> 03:23.200]  Why don't you? Yeah.
[03:23.440 --> 03:24.540]  Why? You put me on the spot.
[03:24.580 --> 03:25.860]  I don't want to just give it away with a clue.
[03:25.920 --> 03:28.000]  I don't trust myself to not give a very.
[03:28.420 --> 03:31.900]  I will say, OK, so a previous question you had asked was,
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.680]  has anybody gotten this correct yet?
[03:33.680 --> 03:35.300]  There have been lots of comments about it.
[03:35.360 --> 03:36.480]  And I said not fully.
[03:36.860 --> 03:38.140]  That is no longer the case.
[03:38.600 --> 03:41.180]  One person has made a completely correct guess.
[03:41.720 --> 03:42.780]  As far as what this is.
[03:42.900 --> 03:44.240]  I have to sift through comments.
[03:44.660 --> 03:46.060]  So season two.
[03:48.140 --> 03:51.560]  Can I tell you my my the worst guess that anyone's made so far?
[03:51.980 --> 03:53.080]  Is it the one I made last?
[03:53.340 --> 03:54.680]  No, it's actually worse.
[03:54.940 --> 03:58.620]  This is I'd be impressed if you if you had a worse guess than this one.
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.080]  And this was done in a message that was very sweet.
[04:02.080 --> 04:03.200]  So it wasn't like a bit.
[04:03.480 --> 04:05.380]  They just they didn't have an awareness of this.
[04:05.460 --> 04:06.680]  And I didn't know how to reply to it.
[04:07.080 --> 04:09.420]  They guessed that the voice was Norm Macdonald.
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.300]  Wow. What?
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.860]  A, dead. B, exceptionally distinctive voice and cadence.
[04:17.200 --> 04:18.780]  Mm hmm. As a double layered.
[04:18.880 --> 04:20.380]  It's the worst guess by far.
[04:20.520 --> 04:23.400]  If I was able to get somebody who is dead to do the previously on.
[04:23.520 --> 04:27.820]  Could you imagine bringing somebody back to just do a previously on voice?
[04:28.120 --> 04:29.360]  That was why they came back.
[04:29.500 --> 04:30.540]  I mean, the previously on voice.
[04:30.540 --> 04:33.320]  The guy sounds like he's got a surfboard in his hands.
[04:33.640 --> 04:35.520]  And that's not what Norm Macdonald sounds like.
[04:35.840 --> 04:37.180]  No, no, it does not.
[04:37.260 --> 04:40.900]  But that's been my favorite of the worst guesses I've gotten by far.
[04:41.780 --> 04:43.420]  So that being said, do you have a guess, Geoff?
[04:43.640 --> 04:46.420]  Is it is it Billy Ripken?
[04:46.740 --> 04:48.680]  It's not. I wish there'd be a great one now.
[04:48.900 --> 04:50.700]  Yeah, I don't I know it's I know it's not.
[04:50.760 --> 04:51.500]  It's way too young.
[04:51.560 --> 04:52.540]  I just don't know what else to ask.
[04:52.740 --> 04:53.740]  Yeah, that's fair.
[04:53.860 --> 04:55.240]  Process of elimination. Totally.
[04:55.500 --> 04:59.100]  We should probably write down your questions and guesses throughout this.
[04:59.100 --> 05:01.920]  I also appreciate that you went with one that I think you already asked
[05:01.920 --> 05:05.700]  when Nick wrote out a much better guess that you just didn't use.
[05:05.940 --> 05:08.980]  Well, you were saying, oh, I wasn't looking at the at the discord.
[05:09.140 --> 05:10.700]  Let me see. Oh, yeah.
[05:11.060 --> 05:13.060]  Yeah, I think it sounds too young to be your barber.
[05:13.180 --> 05:14.300]  I considered that as well.
[05:14.580 --> 05:14.940]  Interesting.
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.660]  Because your barber is like a hundred and five.
[05:16.940 --> 05:17.880]  No, that was my old one.
[05:17.920 --> 05:18.620]  I got a new guy.
[05:19.020 --> 05:19.940]  New, much younger.
[05:20.340 --> 05:21.360]  I swapped swapped out.
[05:21.500 --> 05:22.600]  Gav, do you want to ask a question?
[05:22.800 --> 05:24.240]  You still are. You can still make a guess.
[05:24.540 --> 05:27.100]  Was it a delivery driver that you've had in the past?
[05:27.260 --> 05:27.760]  No, it's not.
[05:28.340 --> 05:29.780]  I thought you already guessed, too.
[05:29.960 --> 05:32.180]  That's how much these popsicles have taken out of me.
[05:32.280 --> 05:33.200]  No, I asked a question.
[05:33.540 --> 05:34.920]  I don't think he didn't make it.
[05:35.040 --> 05:37.060]  I'm still I'm still gathering from that.
[05:37.400 --> 05:38.840]  So Geoff went to the UK.
[05:38.980 --> 05:41.140]  What did you do, Gavin, since we last recorded?
[05:41.600 --> 05:43.300]  I was just here. You're just here.
[05:43.380 --> 05:43.960]  We played Halo.
[05:44.220 --> 05:45.020]  We did play Halo.
[05:45.600 --> 05:46.240]  It's very weird.
[05:46.780 --> 05:49.640]  Gavin brought up that it's because you were in the UK, Geoff,
[05:49.680 --> 05:52.860]  that it's the first time I think we've not recorded an episode
[05:52.860 --> 05:54.580]  because you were like it wasn't him.
[05:54.980 --> 05:57.740]  So him just being available for the week, it's a very strange thing.
[05:57.740 --> 05:59.680]  Like it's an odd rhythm to get out of.
[05:59.700 --> 06:00.780]  It's nice when we're weekly.
[06:01.080 --> 06:05.980]  Usually when Geoff's gone and I'm still here, I get pulled into off topic or something.
[06:06.480 --> 06:07.300]  But that didn't happen.
[06:07.460 --> 06:10.100]  I'm not sure Achievement Hunter knew that face was off.
[06:10.400 --> 06:14.460]  But yeah, I ended up just having a free period where I just played Halo with you.
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.660]  I was I did my taxes.
[06:16.020 --> 06:16.760]  We had an exciting.
[06:16.900 --> 06:17.720]  Well, you were away, Geoff.
[06:17.800 --> 06:18.740]  We had so much fun.
[06:19.080 --> 06:19.860]  Gavin did nothing.
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.060]  And I filed taxes.
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.160]  I was waiting for you to get home from your taxes.
[06:24.360 --> 06:26.240]  Yeah, it sounds like you guys really took advantages.
[06:27.220 --> 06:30.720]  I was very excited to see you texted me, Geoff.
[06:30.780 --> 06:31.900]  You were down watching the challenge.
[06:32.320 --> 06:34.960]  One of my favorite reality shows of all time.
[06:35.260 --> 06:36.260]  I'm a survivor.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.700]  Yeah, I I started watching it.
[06:38.780 --> 06:39.740]  I don't remember why.
[06:39.820 --> 06:41.980]  I think we're just in the hotel room and bored and it was on.
[06:42.180 --> 06:43.340]  And I was like, fuck it.
[06:43.420 --> 06:44.220]  Let's give this a shot.
[06:44.280 --> 06:47.640]  And I've I honestly forgot about it until this moment.
[06:47.700 --> 06:50.920]  So thank you for reminding me that I need to finish watching that show
[06:50.920 --> 06:52.340]  because I was quite enjoying it.
[06:52.340 --> 06:56.760]  I found that the the challenges to the challenge, you know,
[06:56.820 --> 07:01.780]  I'll say half of the half of the enjoyment of reality TV for me
[07:01.780 --> 07:06.540]  is watching people just like just mishandle their lives.
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.900]  The other half of reality TV that I enjoy is watching games
[07:11.900 --> 07:15.840]  that people play, like the inventiveness, the creation of the games.
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.420]  It's why I love it's why I enjoy Big Brother.
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.440]  Sometimes it's obviously why I like Survivor.
[07:20.440 --> 07:23.420]  And the challenge has some really interesting,
[07:23.840 --> 07:27.220]  like legitimately physically demanding,
[07:27.900 --> 07:30.140]  maybe more so even than Survivor challenges.
[07:30.280 --> 07:31.920]  And I'm kind of fascinated by that.
[07:32.040 --> 07:33.840]  Like they are no joke, the challenges.
[07:34.160 --> 07:35.860]  Yeah, they they get ridiculous.
[07:36.120 --> 07:40.640]  And it's for me, it's a great mix of the social politics of Survivor,
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.220]  but from much dumber, trashier people.
[07:43.340 --> 07:47.560]  Yeah. And then all the same people like there's a guy on there named CT,
[07:47.980 --> 07:51.040]  who I think he did his first challenge when he was 27.
[07:51.300 --> 07:55.720]  He's 41 now, I want to say, and he's been on essentially every season.
[07:55.900 --> 07:59.800]  So it's like you have all this buildup of bullshit from like decades.
[08:00.120 --> 08:01.040]  That's also interesting.
[08:01.260 --> 08:05.860]  Like it is it is such a like a like you see people like the season I watch.
[08:05.960 --> 08:07.700]  There's somebody I recognize from Survivor on.
[08:07.780 --> 08:08.960]  So that was cool. Yes.
[08:09.120 --> 08:11.400]  And there was somebody from Big Brother who I didn't know.
[08:11.500 --> 08:15.020]  But it's cool to see the inner the interplay of different reality shows.
[08:15.020 --> 08:17.940]  But mostly there seems to be a core group of people
[08:18.860 --> 08:21.560]  who just live in this challenge.
[08:21.940 --> 08:23.240]  Yes. Universe.
[08:23.600 --> 08:26.760]  And it's their entire lives to the point where they're like they'll
[08:27.700 --> 08:28.500]  interesting dynamics.
[08:28.960 --> 08:31.420]  The first people that get voted out are people that are on the show
[08:31.420 --> 08:32.040]  for the first time.
[08:32.420 --> 08:37.180]  Like the worst thing you can do is be on your first season of that show.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.880]  You were instantly gone.
[08:38.980 --> 08:41.680]  They're like, you got to pay your dues, got to take your lumps,
[08:41.760 --> 08:42.660]  get the fuck out of here.
[08:43.020 --> 08:43.720]  See you next year.
[08:43.720 --> 08:46.140]  And then it's like brutal.
[08:46.340 --> 08:47.140]  They don't even care.
[08:47.260 --> 08:48.840]  They're just like, yeah, it's your first time. Get the fuck out.
[08:49.020 --> 08:51.220]  And for other people, it's like a full time job.
[08:51.420 --> 08:52.540]  It's like their entire lives.
[08:52.680 --> 08:53.840]  Yeah, it's all they do.
[08:53.940 --> 08:56.100]  And it's it's just it's an absurd.
[08:56.720 --> 08:58.800]  There's so many great as it's progressed.
[08:58.880 --> 09:02.520]  It's gotten more into the physical side and it being really challenging.
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.000]  On the earlier seasons, it was just like a giant party
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.060]  where people were fucking up.
[09:07.320 --> 09:10.900]  They had to die all the vodka because people were smuggling them
[09:10.900 --> 09:13.580]  in their water bottles to do the challenges and just getting drunk
[09:13.580 --> 09:14.780]  like while they were competing.
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.480]  There'd be time where cast members would just like leave and go into the city
[09:18.480 --> 09:20.800]  and they'd have to shut down production for like four days
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.240]  because three of the contestants were just partying in Africa and they lost them.
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.320]  And it's now a much less fun show, but way more serious.
[09:30.440 --> 09:31.220]  It's just dumb.
[09:31.400 --> 09:33.260]  There's so much great pettiness to it.
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.920]  I think dumb is the great way to describe it.
[09:34.960 --> 09:38.380]  It's like if you're not familiar with that show, it's like all the
[09:38.380 --> 09:41.860]  the dumbest people on Temptation Island and Love Island,
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.460]  but who aggressively want to win a contest, a competition.
[09:46.880 --> 09:48.980]  Yes. Like the goal is not to find love.
[09:49.120 --> 09:52.280]  Love is like a byproduct of apparently getting drunk enough
[09:52.280 --> 09:54.000]  and being available in the night.
[09:54.380 --> 09:58.340]  But they legitimately want to win these physical competitions.
[09:58.660 --> 09:59.640]  So it's all it's like that.
[09:59.760 --> 10:00.340]  It's like that.
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.800]  It's like the dumbest, meatiest people going head to head.
[10:03.840 --> 10:04.680]  It's fucking great.
[10:04.820 --> 10:06.460]  I'm going to send you a post clip.
[10:06.460 --> 10:08.960]  One of, I think, the greatest edited videos of all time.
[10:09.120 --> 10:10.360]  I've shown this to Eric before.
[10:10.800 --> 10:14.100]  Somebody added together an argument between two CT,
[10:14.300 --> 10:16.200]  who I mentioned, and another regular named Wes.
[10:16.540 --> 10:18.580]  Watch this, Gavin. It's like 60 seconds long.
[10:18.860 --> 10:21.840]  I feel like this summarizes the energy of the show fully.
[10:22.360 --> 10:24.080]  It's a fantastic breakdown.
[10:24.320 --> 10:24.460]  All right.
[10:24.520 --> 10:25.660]  What do you say? Should we watch this right now?
[10:25.760 --> 10:26.400]  Yeah, let's play.
[10:26.840 --> 10:27.480]  Is this guy Hammett?
[10:27.740 --> 10:28.120]  Oh, yeah.
[10:31.120 --> 10:32.400]  This is what the show is.
[10:32.760 --> 10:34.060]  It's just aggressively screaming.
[10:36.500 --> 10:38.080]  All he does is smash heads.
[10:42.500 --> 10:45.700]  Is this as it is in the show, like how it was edited?
[10:46.220 --> 10:48.760]  No, this is somebody did this.
[10:49.220 --> 10:53.880]  It's unfortunately censored when you see it live, but just die, die, die.
[10:54.780 --> 10:56.420]  The timestamps are so funny.
[10:59.140 --> 11:01.080]  Man, I hope they ran that as a trailer.
[11:01.440 --> 11:06.200]  So a great thing about CT is he was banned for like six seasons
[11:06.200 --> 11:07.720]  because he kept fighting people.
[11:08.520 --> 11:10.420]  He fucked the guy up like they couldn't.
[11:10.560 --> 11:12.820]  It took like seven security guards to hold him back.
[11:12.960 --> 11:16.800]  And he just annihilated the tiniest guy on the cast.
[11:17.200 --> 11:17.860]  But he's back now.
[11:18.220 --> 11:19.480]  He's now a lovable character.
[11:19.760 --> 11:21.580]  Which one was CT in that?
[11:21.740 --> 11:23.540]  CT was the die, die, die guy.
[11:23.700 --> 11:24.380]  Die, die, die.
[11:24.440 --> 11:27.440]  The other guy is a bad guy on the season I'm watching.
[11:28.120 --> 11:29.580]  Yes. And he's always been a bad guy.
[11:29.740 --> 11:30.960]  He's been like a bad guy forever.
[11:31.080 --> 11:31.780]  One of my favorite.
[11:32.160 --> 11:33.460]  I mean, not to go too deep on the challenge.
[11:33.460 --> 11:37.320]  My favorite like petty dumb thing is there is this issue
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.980]  where a woman had a note left in her bed saying that
[11:40.980 --> 11:44.140]  I know you're just sleeping with him for his vote or something like that.
[11:44.300 --> 11:45.740]  And it caused all this drama.
[11:46.080 --> 11:49.240]  And then the notes started getting left out throughout the whole season.
[11:49.340 --> 11:50.720]  They're like, who the fuck is leaving notes?
[11:50.920 --> 11:53.860]  And like they're trying to they have they made everybody write down
[11:53.860 --> 11:55.960]  one of the messages to try to like match the writing.
[11:56.160 --> 11:59.000]  And then somebody revealed that him and his sister
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.820]  wrote all the notes before they came on.
[12:00.820 --> 12:02.300]  Like he had his sister write them.
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.320]  So it wouldn't match anybody.
[12:03.480 --> 12:07.420]  And they're just generic messages that he wanted to apply throughout the season.
[12:07.500 --> 12:09.520]  So like it wasn't aimed at anyone specific.
[12:09.660 --> 12:11.540]  He just had this bag of notes that he could deploy
[12:11.540 --> 12:14.040]  and it caused complete chaos in the house.
[12:14.340 --> 12:16.140]  It's fantastic. It's a great series.
[12:16.260 --> 12:18.080]  I would highly recommend anybody watch the challenge,
[12:18.260 --> 12:19.700]  especially the earlier seasons of it.
[12:19.960 --> 12:22.180]  The other night I watched Being John Malkovich,
[12:22.640 --> 12:24.220]  which I hadn't seen in a long time.
[12:24.280 --> 12:24.720]  Have you ever seen that?
[12:24.800 --> 12:26.580]  I've never seen it. I've always wanted to.
[12:26.700 --> 12:27.460]  I hear it's so good.
[12:27.600 --> 12:29.400]  It's I mean, it's weird. It's pretty good.
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.040]  I was watching it and I was like, this is so weird.
[12:33.220 --> 12:34.720]  I wonder how this...
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.020]  I wouldn't know what to do if I was hard of hearing right now,
[12:38.020 --> 12:43.660]  because there's a bit where basically one woman is in love with Cameron Diaz,
[12:43.820 --> 12:47.300]  but only when Cameron Diaz is inside John Malkovich.
[12:47.700 --> 12:50.560]  So they like meet up, but only when she's in Malkovich.
[12:50.760 --> 12:54.000]  And at one point they start having sex and like different people are talking,
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.640]  like you can hear Cameron Diaz and you can hear John Malkovich
[12:57.640 --> 12:58.640]  and you can hear the other woman.
[12:58.640 --> 13:00.440]  And I was like, what the hell is going on?
[13:00.440 --> 13:02.460]  What is what the subtitle is doing right now?
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.680]  And I just turned on the subtitles and I just laughed my ass off.
[13:08.740 --> 13:12.260]  And it says unzipping and then just both characters moaning.
[13:12.360 --> 13:13.320]  I was like, yeah, I mean,
[13:16.020 --> 13:19.080]  sure, it would be honestly the most confusing movie
[13:19.080 --> 13:20.960]  to watch without one of your senses.
[13:21.480 --> 13:23.620]  I recommend watching it, though, so it's weird as shit.
[13:23.840 --> 13:24.660]  I'll add it to my list.
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.900]  I need to watch The Long Kiss Goodnight.
[13:27.340 --> 13:28.480]  That's high on my queue now.
[13:28.480 --> 13:29.680]  That's a great movie.
[13:30.260 --> 13:32.660]  We were that terrible movie.
[13:32.820 --> 13:33.440]  That's a great movie.
[13:33.500 --> 13:37.360]  You talk about it's a what's her face and
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.820]  Samuel Jackson's in it, too, right?
[13:39.900 --> 13:41.520]  Yes. So I haven't seen it.
[13:41.640 --> 13:45.140]  Rennie Harlan is my favorite schlock director of all time.
[13:45.340 --> 13:47.940]  I don't think he's ever made a genuinely good movie,
[13:48.120 --> 13:51.080]  but he makes really fun, bad movies like consistently.
[13:51.160 --> 13:53.220]  Is it Gina Davis? Who's the?
[13:53.360 --> 13:54.600]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[13:54.700 --> 13:56.540]  Yeah, like a sleeper agent or something.
[13:56.540 --> 13:59.200]  And she doesn't realize she's like chopping up the vegetables
[13:59.200 --> 14:00.440]  and then she's like a fucking badass.
[14:00.560 --> 14:02.800]  She doesn't realize. Oh, that was a I saw that movie in the theater.
[14:02.880 --> 14:03.560]  I haven't seen it since.
[14:03.640 --> 14:06.280]  So maybe it doesn't hold up after 30 years, but I remember loving it.
[14:06.360 --> 14:07.260]  I'm excited to see it.
[14:07.600 --> 14:08.740]  Eric is live. Why are we?
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.200]  Should I click this?
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.160]  Oh, let's watch Eric. Watching Eric.
[14:13.480 --> 14:14.720]  I wanted to show you guys.
[14:14.840 --> 14:17.700]  I didn't want to put it in the chat, but I got the shirt.
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.980]  Are we good to go?
[14:21.140 --> 14:23.560]  Can I send? Can I send to that? Yes, yes.
[14:23.560 --> 14:24.480]  I think that's good.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.560]  Yes, yes. OK, I just want to.
[14:27.800 --> 14:28.320]  Hell yeah.
[14:28.880 --> 14:31.540]  So just for people at home, just so you know, because we can't put it
[14:31.540 --> 14:32.800]  in, we can't put it in the chat.
[14:33.060 --> 14:34.800]  This is the anal passage shirt.
[14:34.960 --> 14:36.140]  That's a great point.
[14:36.360 --> 14:37.880]  That's a sneak. I believe.
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.260]  OK, cool. So I'll let them know to send it by the time you listen to this episode.
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.920]  I don't know if you can still get this shirt.
[14:43.980 --> 14:45.320]  You can try. I'm sure you can.
[14:45.740 --> 14:50.420]  But the anal passage shirt is was on sale and is now probably gone.
[14:50.540 --> 14:52.160]  So I hope you enjoyed. Fantastic.
[14:53.760 --> 14:56.360]  When are we? Is that going up tomorrow at noon?
[14:56.580 --> 14:57.400]  So when is it? Yeah, wait.
[14:57.560 --> 15:00.120]  People are only going to be able to buy it without before the podcast came.
[15:00.140 --> 15:00.980]  Yeah, I think there.
[15:01.540 --> 15:04.440]  Let me read you the description for the shirt, which I've lifted
[15:04.440 --> 15:06.100]  from the annual pass shirt.
[15:06.660 --> 15:10.620]  Theme parks are opening their gates in the scent of fresh chili dogs
[15:10.620 --> 15:11.760]  hangs in the air.
[15:12.260 --> 15:13.880]  It's anal passage season.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.400]  And that means it's time to grab a new AP marquee
[15:17.400 --> 15:20.060]  tee to celebrate the most wonderful time of the year.
[15:20.300 --> 15:21.620]  Listen to episode one oh one.
[15:23.600 --> 15:24.480]  That's fantastic.
[15:24.680 --> 15:25.660]  That's fantastic.
[15:25.940 --> 15:28.320]  That's going to be a great little Easter egg for people to find it.
[15:28.560 --> 15:29.340]  Oh, yes.
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.240]  I was worried in between episodes that Jack would be genuinely mad at that one.
[15:33.460 --> 15:39.020]  Well, you said it's going to come out and release before he could react to it.
[15:39.180 --> 15:41.820]  Like it sounds like that shirt will be available tomorrow.
[15:42.720 --> 15:44.380]  Also, it doesn't matter, I guess.
[15:44.460 --> 15:48.840]  I released a fucking face shirt to him with his dumb bald head
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.440]  that was up for like four days and then told him he could get revenge
[15:52.440 --> 15:54.420]  on me whenever he wanted to and he's too lazy to do it.
[15:54.480 --> 15:55.400]  So I wouldn't worry too much.
[15:55.460 --> 15:58.020]  Even if he is mad, he's just going to stew in his own juices.
[15:58.140 --> 15:59.220]  He's not going to do anything about it.
[16:00.820 --> 16:04.020]  So so this will go on sale at the time of this recording.
[16:04.060 --> 16:05.000]  It'll go on sale tomorrow.
[16:05.100 --> 16:08.420]  At the time of you listening to this episode, it will have already been on sale
[16:08.420 --> 16:10.100]  and you can no longer get it, I assume.
[16:10.980 --> 16:12.080]  We assume. Yeah.
[16:12.220 --> 16:15.920]  Hey, if if we're on the subject of shirts, can I bring something up real quick?
[16:16.180 --> 16:19.320]  That, of course, me and Andrew were in the merch.
[16:19.480 --> 16:22.140]  We were in the merch meeting earlier today.
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.460]  And we got the numbers for the regulation listener and comment
[16:27.460 --> 16:30.000]  leaver shirts, and they didn't they did well.
[16:30.200 --> 16:32.540]  However, one did way better than the other.
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.480]  The regulation listener did like five times the numbers that content
[16:37.480 --> 16:39.280]  or that the comment leaver did.
[16:39.500 --> 16:43.360]  And I need people to really take a long, hard look at themselves
[16:43.360 --> 16:48.520]  if they're a regulation listener or a comment leaver, because I have a feeling
[16:48.520 --> 16:51.200]  there were a lot of people who bought regulation listener shirts
[16:51.200 --> 16:53.220]  who are truly comment leavers.
[16:53.620 --> 16:57.500]  I have absolute proof of this where it on the face Twitter account
[16:57.500 --> 17:00.580]  just as a joke to myself, like it was we tweeted.
[17:00.840 --> 17:01.960]  Are you a regulation listener?
[17:02.080 --> 17:02.940]  Are you a comment leaver?
[17:03.100 --> 17:06.040]  And a lot of people like the first five were all like, I'm right.
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.260]  I'm a regulation listener.
[17:07.420 --> 17:09.420]  It's like, I don't think you understand how this works.
[17:09.540 --> 17:11.300]  They don't. You need to buy the other shirt.
[17:11.620 --> 17:14.440]  If you go on the subreddit, it's like these people who like jump
[17:14.440 --> 17:15.260]  through these hoops on.
[17:15.700 --> 17:18.140]  Well, I'm leaving a comment here, but it's not on the show.
[17:18.520 --> 17:20.440]  So really, I'm a regulation listener.
[17:20.600 --> 17:23.300]  And it's like, no, you're leaving a comment on something from the show.
[17:24.320 --> 17:25.300]  You're a comment leaver.
[17:25.680 --> 17:26.420]  You've left a comment.
[17:26.660 --> 17:29.820]  The joy in my head of this entire premise is, you know, like
[17:29.820 --> 17:33.040]  if you're in an audience or whatever, it'd be like everybody who's a comment leaver
[17:33.040 --> 17:35.620]  say like there'd be like a big response.
[17:35.860 --> 17:38.900]  Everybody who's a regulation listener, just nothing.
[17:39.160 --> 17:40.320]  That's what's funny to me about it.
[17:40.380 --> 17:42.620]  Like there should be zero response.
[17:42.740 --> 17:44.400]  It should seem like an empty room.
[17:44.600 --> 17:47.540]  I mean, it makes total sense, though, that the regulation
[17:47.540 --> 17:50.520]  list of sells better because there are more people who don't comment.
[17:50.720 --> 17:54.700]  But I don't the numbers indicate to me that there is a discrepancy in people
[17:54.700 --> 17:58.160]  that are just not, as Eric said, coming to terms with the fact.
[17:58.440 --> 17:59.440]  Yeah, in fact, the comment leaver.
[17:59.600 --> 18:02.540]  It's either people lying to themselves or they're just confused.
[18:02.780 --> 18:07.740]  Because I think the regulation listener just as itself plays in a really funny way.
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.680]  It's not indicative of anything.
[18:10.060 --> 18:11.980]  It's just you regulation listen.
[18:12.440 --> 18:15.380]  Like if somebody saw someone wear that without any context,
[18:15.520 --> 18:16.500]  like it means nothing.
[18:16.500 --> 18:18.540]  It means they listen to things, I guess.
[18:18.820 --> 18:21.540]  But there's an absolute comment leaver denial happening.
[18:23.540 --> 18:25.320]  It is OK to be a comment leaver.
[18:25.640 --> 18:26.540]  I'm a comment leaver.
[18:26.660 --> 18:29.560]  Yeah, I'm way more comment leaver than comment on other stuff.
[18:29.760 --> 18:30.580]  A lot of people's stuff.
[18:30.720 --> 18:33.300]  I comment. I've commented on stuff relating to the show.
[18:33.420 --> 18:35.220]  Yeah. You're on this show. That doesn't count.
[18:35.420 --> 18:36.660]  No, I'm definitely comment leaver.
[18:36.740 --> 18:37.900]  I've commented on the show.
[18:38.060 --> 18:39.640]  You can't comment, leave your own show.
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.140]  You absolutely can. Yeah.
[18:41.300 --> 18:42.640]  That's a ridiculous thing.
[18:42.880 --> 18:44.060]  That's not weird, though.
[18:44.140 --> 18:46.260]  It's weird to leave a comment on someone else's show.
[18:46.260 --> 18:48.020]  That's the whole point of a comment leaver, isn't it?
[18:48.180 --> 18:52.000]  I would maybe argue it's more weird to comment publicly on a show that I'm on
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.240]  when I don't need to comment, when I have channels internally to do it.
[18:55.300 --> 18:57.120]  I think it's maybe weirder that I'm doing it.
[18:57.140 --> 18:59.420]  But Eric's whole point was like, who leaves a comment?
[18:59.800 --> 19:00.860]  But me on the show.
[19:00.920 --> 19:02.260]  It makes sense for you to leave the comment.
[19:02.520 --> 19:03.560]  No, I don't think it does.
[19:03.620 --> 19:06.180]  If I'm just commenting about it, sometimes, you know, I might just say,
[19:06.220 --> 19:08.580]  hey, good app, good app, I'll just post good app in the comments.
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.400]  We need to include people who've never even heard of the show.
[19:11.700 --> 19:13.300]  We need one that's just a shirt buyer.
[19:15.700 --> 19:21.340]  You want a shirt that just says shirt buyer?
[19:22.240 --> 19:23.500]  Like, if they don't understand,
[19:23.800 --> 19:26.400]  they don't understand comment leaver and regulation listener,
[19:26.520 --> 19:27.800]  then it like need to reply.
[19:27.940 --> 19:29.560]  But they would never buy the shirt.
[19:29.900 --> 19:31.740]  They need to know to get to the shirt.
[19:31.920 --> 19:32.720]  What are you talking about?
[19:32.740 --> 19:36.780]  So then they would be, so then you have a shirt that says non-shirt buyer?
[19:37.020 --> 19:40.740]  No, you can't have a shirt that says non-shirt buyer because that's impossible.
[19:40.740 --> 19:43.280]  You're saying, Gavin, like a lost child,
[19:43.420 --> 19:47.080]  they somehow end up in the store and then they don't know what to buy.
[19:47.200 --> 19:48.500]  So they need a shirt that fit.
[19:48.620 --> 19:50.200]  They need to understand the premise.
[19:50.380 --> 19:52.460]  Like the person you're describing doesn't exist.
[19:52.760 --> 19:53.660]  They're an impossibility.
[19:53.880 --> 19:57.260]  You find yourself on this on the Rooster Teeth store and you see two options
[19:57.260 --> 20:00.240]  and you think, I don't know what either of those mean, but I'll buy a shirt.
[20:01.160 --> 20:02.440]  I'm here. I'm a shirt buyer.
[20:02.680 --> 20:04.480]  I'm on this site to buy a shirt.
[20:04.600 --> 20:07.540]  Didn't mean to be here, but I'm locked in and committed to buying a shirt.
[20:07.840 --> 20:08.980]  I don't know what any of these mean.
[20:09.020 --> 20:10.120]  I guess I'm a shirt buyer.
[20:11.560 --> 20:12.680]  I would buy a shirt.
[20:12.880 --> 20:15.080]  What percentage... I would buy that shirt too,
[20:15.140 --> 20:16.920]  but not for the reasons that you're listing.
[20:17.140 --> 20:19.260]  That's an insane, logical...
[20:19.260 --> 20:21.900]  I think we need an option for people who don't listen to the show.
[20:22.340 --> 20:25.780]  Why would we sell a shirt for people who don't listen?
[20:26.000 --> 20:26.800]  What if... All right.
[20:26.880 --> 20:30.240]  What if... Because what... How about... I agree with you, Gavin.
[20:30.600 --> 20:32.240]  And I'm OK with a shirt buyer. You agree with me?
[20:32.460 --> 20:33.320]  What? I have to agree.
[20:33.760 --> 20:35.000]  I think we can tweak it.
[20:35.280 --> 20:37.100]  What if instead of a shirt buyer...
[20:37.100 --> 20:38.880]  Because you might want to give it to somebody as a gift.
[20:38.880 --> 20:42.000]  And if you receive a shirt buyer as a gift, you may not be a shirt buyer.
[20:42.120 --> 20:44.120]  What if we just had a shirt that said shirt wearer?
[20:44.440 --> 20:45.780]  That encompasses everyone.
[20:45.960 --> 20:47.360]  We have got... This is so insane.
[20:47.360 --> 20:50.280]  Seven billion people on Earth all wear shirts, I assume.
[20:50.480 --> 20:51.780]  I feel like it should just say t-shirt.
[20:51.780 --> 20:54.420]  We couldn't have a...
[20:54.980 --> 20:58.060]  Because if you're wearing a shirt that says shirt wearer, that's redundant.
[20:58.260 --> 20:59.460]  You're clearly a shirt wearer.
[20:59.600 --> 21:02.080]  It doesn't mean... Wearing a shirt that says shirt is redundant.
[21:02.340 --> 21:02.880]  No, it's not.
[21:03.140 --> 21:03.880]  Well, then what do you mean?
[21:04.280 --> 21:04.940]  It's a shirt.
[21:05.500 --> 21:06.800]  It's a shirt. It's a shirt.
[21:07.240 --> 21:07.760]  It's a t-shirt.
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.040]  And it says shirt on it.
[21:09.040 --> 21:10.800]  It's a clarification of what it is.
[21:11.040 --> 21:13.120]  Yeah, but you need you need the verb.
[21:13.400 --> 21:15.360]  Yeah, and it needs... You can't just have shirt.
[21:15.520 --> 21:17.700]  There needs to be an action on the shirt.
[21:18.340 --> 21:19.520]  Yeah, like I bought... Comment leaver.
[21:20.060 --> 21:20.900]  Regulation. You want it.
[21:21.320 --> 21:23.520]  Listener. Nick said shirt haver.
[21:23.920 --> 21:26.000]  Shirt haver is a good one.
[21:26.260 --> 21:27.560]  I'm more okay with that. Shirt wearer.
[21:27.580 --> 21:31.620]  I like shirt haver because you don't even need to put it on.
[21:31.960 --> 21:33.800]  It works when it's like in your drawer.
[21:35.260 --> 21:36.980]  This is so insane.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.640]  Let us know.
[21:38.720 --> 21:42.460]  We're absolutely not going to make a shirt haver shirt unless
[21:43.140 --> 21:47.120]  there is an overwhelming amount of of demand.
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.260]  If you want a shirt haver shirt.
[21:49.700 --> 21:50.400]  Let us know.
[21:51.100 --> 21:53.080]  You can't let us know because then you'd be a comment leaver.
[21:53.720 --> 21:55.340]  Yeah, it's impossible.
[21:55.720 --> 21:56.760]  There's no way.
[21:57.340 --> 22:00.920]  We can't take the regulation or listener's word for it
[22:00.920 --> 22:02.880]  because then they become comment leavers.
[22:03.340 --> 22:05.700]  So then they have to become shirt havers.
[22:05.700 --> 22:06.880]  This is really.
[22:07.120 --> 22:08.600]  Oh, yeah, that's a good point.
[22:08.740 --> 22:11.320]  Not only would they not leave a comment, they won't even hear this
[22:11.320 --> 22:12.280]  because it's not for them.
[22:12.520 --> 22:14.940]  Oh, well, the problem is super complicated.
[22:15.140 --> 22:17.480]  Well, I guess not because they will leave a comment on Instagram
[22:17.480 --> 22:20.480]  and just say it wasn't a comment and just continue as they exist.
[22:20.720 --> 22:21.540]  How is it not a comment?
[22:21.740 --> 22:23.340]  It's definitely a comment, I think.
[22:23.460 --> 22:25.600]  Well, to define a comment, I think it's anything.
[22:26.200 --> 22:26.900]  I think it's just anything.
[22:27.100 --> 22:29.480]  You went somewhere online and typed something.
[22:29.760 --> 22:30.600]  Yeah. Yeah.
[22:30.740 --> 22:32.680]  I think if you went, yeah, I think that's a good classification.
[22:32.680 --> 22:33.960]  I think so.
[22:34.020 --> 22:36.400]  Nick is saying is a message, a comment like a DM.
[22:36.760 --> 22:41.520]  If you message me about a show, I can't stress enough how you're a comment
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.220]  leaver because I don't want to read it.
[22:43.460 --> 22:44.280]  I don't want to see it.
[22:44.300 --> 22:46.600]  But you sure are commenting about what we're doing.
[22:46.700 --> 22:48.420]  So absolutely. You're a comment leaver.
[22:48.680 --> 22:51.980]  That's almost an extra comment leaver because you're getting really pointed
[22:51.980 --> 22:53.120]  and focused with the comment.
[22:53.280 --> 22:55.500]  Yeah, too. That's too focused for a comment.
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.680]  Yeah, I don't like it.
[22:56.740 --> 22:58.960]  So that's that's a no to the shirt buyer.
[22:59.160 --> 23:01.460]  I think let's just try to get through the anal passage
[23:01.460 --> 23:02.840]  and then we'll see what happens.
[23:03.100 --> 23:05.080]  Otherwise, we're averaging at one shirt per show.
[23:05.220 --> 23:08.160]  By the time this comes out, we'll definitely be through the anal passage.
[23:08.440 --> 23:10.420]  I don't think that's going to be a big issue.
[23:11.780 --> 23:14.500]  Well, that's great, because the anal passage will be sold out
[23:14.500 --> 23:16.640]  and some people out there might want to buy a shirt.
[23:17.140 --> 23:20.860]  Sold out is a fun way to say forcefully pulled down.
[23:21.280 --> 23:22.840]  I appreciate your flip of words.
[23:22.860 --> 23:26.480]  Hang on. You're saying that people might want the anal passage shirt,
[23:26.760 --> 23:30.680]  but it's not theirs, so they'll have to buy a shirt haver shirt.
[23:33.180 --> 23:36.580]  Are you looking to get a gift for somebody in your life
[23:36.580 --> 23:38.340]  and you're not sure what to get them?
[23:38.540 --> 23:39.960]  Maybe they're hard to shop for.
[23:40.100 --> 23:40.800]  I got news for you.
[23:40.920 --> 23:42.140]  Everybody wears a shirt.
[23:42.560 --> 23:44.600]  And if you have a shirt, you're a shirt haver.
[23:44.820 --> 23:46.660]  Go ahead and buy him a shirt haver shirt.
[23:46.940 --> 23:48.460]  It'll be super appropriate.
[23:49.260 --> 23:50.100]  Is haver a word?
[23:50.960 --> 23:51.940]  What do you care?
[23:53.720 --> 23:56.120]  70% of the shit that comes out of your mouth isn't a word.
[23:56.340 --> 23:59.520]  Well, haver, I don't know, is really a word, but haver is.
[23:59.520 --> 24:02.180]  And it's Scottish to talk foolishly.
[24:02.180 --> 24:04.120]  So I think we're really havering.
[24:04.260 --> 24:05.960]  It's perfect. All right.
[24:06.040 --> 24:07.920]  Well, we'll shelf that for now.
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.100]  I just was.
[24:10.320 --> 24:13.580]  Is the Bovril Pop two uniform inventions in one?
[24:13.720 --> 24:17.040]  Is that the beef bracelet mixed with two spicy?
[24:17.160 --> 24:18.300]  Two spicy. Is that what that is?
[24:18.480 --> 24:20.920]  Well, Ross, do me a favor.
[24:21.380 --> 24:24.740]  Eat some some spicy Thai food or Indian food or something
[24:24.740 --> 24:26.920]  and then shove that Bob pop up your asshole.
[24:27.160 --> 24:28.960]  And let me know if it relieves the pain.
[24:28.960 --> 24:31.680]  If it doesn't, then it probably doesn't work in that capacity.
[24:31.860 --> 24:33.280]  OK, but if it does, then yeah.
[24:33.540 --> 24:36.700]  Oh, sure. Owner says Nick shirt owner.
[24:37.120 --> 24:38.900]  I'm I'm a definite shirt owner.
[24:39.360 --> 24:42.780]  Do you have to go back to movies from your beard haver as well?
[24:42.880 --> 24:45.060]  Currently? Yeah, that's that's actually correct.
[24:45.160 --> 24:46.620]  I cannot wait for us to be done.
[24:46.740 --> 24:49.640]  And I could have a shower to get the smell of beef.
[24:49.660 --> 24:51.480]  Just just I need to.
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.160]  I need this so bad.
[24:53.280 --> 24:54.620]  I'm struggling through this.
[24:54.780 --> 24:56.300]  I wonder when that cow is alive.
[24:56.300 --> 25:00.260]  Uh, that's a that's a fascinating question.
[25:00.440 --> 25:01.980]  Do you think that's a pre pandemic, Bob?
[25:02.400 --> 25:04.960]  I don't think I don't think you're talking about a cow.
[25:05.060 --> 25:06.760]  I think you're talking about a couple thousand cows
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.600]  probably comprised into that one part, just like a vat of cow chum.
[25:10.940 --> 25:11.700]  Yeah. Yeah.
[25:11.920 --> 25:13.400]  I just ate a field of cow.
[25:13.960 --> 25:16.420]  Yeah. You ate half an Argentinian farm.
[25:16.660 --> 25:19.320]  Oh, yeah. You ate you ate elements of lots of cows.
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.380]  Oh, I hate I've never thought how many chickens are in like a thing of nuggets
[25:23.380 --> 25:26.740]  like a McNugget box, like a six piece.
[25:27.180 --> 25:29.400]  Yeah, it's a ton. It's a ton.
[25:29.780 --> 25:32.000]  I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse about that.
[25:32.140 --> 25:34.640]  Like if somebody said, you just ate, ate Larry.
[25:34.880 --> 25:36.080]  I think that's upsetting.
[25:36.180 --> 25:38.720]  But if it's so many, I can't possibly know the name.
[25:39.600 --> 25:41.240]  You just a Larry person.
[25:41.300 --> 25:44.320]  As opposed to you just ate Larry and everyone he's ever known.
[25:44.700 --> 25:46.700]  Yeah. Like it's it's too much.
[25:47.200 --> 25:50.520]  It's like when you certain once you hit a certain threshold of numbers,
[25:50.520 --> 25:52.480]  it's like it doesn't matter. It's all the same.
[25:52.480 --> 25:55.600]  I think it's I think it would be worse if you knew the chicken's name.
[25:55.720 --> 25:57.940]  Yeah. Never ask a chicken's name.
[25:58.940 --> 26:01.460]  Word to the wise. Yeah, it's a good tip.
[26:07.120 --> 26:08.760]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey,
[26:08.900 --> 26:11.480]  the easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[26:11.860 --> 26:14.320]  I love to online shop. It's the main way I shop.
[26:14.680 --> 26:16.700]  I hate going into the store dealing with lines.
[26:16.820 --> 26:17.720]  All that is an annoyance.
[26:17.800 --> 26:19.320]  So I shop online as much as possible.
[26:19.800 --> 26:22.240]  But when it comes to checkout, I never have a coupon code ready.
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.280]  Thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past.
[26:26.440 --> 26:29.620]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the Internet for promo codes
[26:29.620 --> 26:31.440]  and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[26:31.900 --> 26:34.800]  How it works is imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[26:35.260 --> 26:37.120]  When you check out, the Honey button appears
[26:37.120 --> 26:39.340]  and all you have to do is click apply coupons.
[26:39.780 --> 26:42.680]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons it can find for that site.
[26:43.160 --> 26:46.740]  If Honey finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop immediately.
[26:47.080 --> 26:49.500]  I recently used Honey to save money on clothing.
[26:50.020 --> 26:53.220]  So many sites I go to, though, it's just so much fun to just hit the button,
[26:53.340 --> 26:56.140]  find coupons, save yourself money. It's great.
[26:56.140 --> 26:57.400]  It's a fantastic service.
[26:57.680 --> 26:59.940]  But did you know that Honey doesn't just work on desktop?
[27:00.440 --> 27:01.600]  It works on your iPhone, too.
[27:02.060 --> 27:04.820]  Just activate it on Safari on your phone and save it on the go.
[27:05.480 --> 27:08.080]  If you don't already have Honey, it could be straight up missing out.
[27:08.220 --> 27:11.000]  And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid in supporting the show.
[27:11.480 --> 27:13.160]  I'd never recommend something I don't use.
[27:13.620 --> 27:16.080]  Get Honey for free at joinhoney.com slash face.
[27:16.580 --> 27:19.240]  That's joinhoney.com slash face.
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.620]  You know, what sucks is all of the advantages that big businesses
[27:23.620 --> 27:26.460]  have over the little guy, like having more access to funding,
[27:26.840 --> 27:30.400]  on top of getting better rates and other privileges reserved for the top dogs.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.720]  If you run an e-commerce business, you probably feel like it's about time
[27:33.720 --> 27:37.640]  people stop treating e-commerce giants better just because they're bigger.

[28:02.400 --> 28:03.220]  It's a no brainer.
[28:03.340 --> 28:06.120]  I mean, with the money I could save, I could send an armada of port-a-potties
[28:06.120 --> 28:08.440]  to Geoff's house once again. Do a round two.

[29:01.420 --> 29:03.220]  This ad is brought to you by Raycon.
[29:03.380 --> 29:06.780]  Lately, I've been listening to a lot of Randy Newman, and it's been great.
[29:07.060 --> 29:08.820]  One of the reasons it's been great to listen to,
[29:09.180 --> 29:11.920]  because I use my Raycon wireless earbuds to do it.
[29:12.520 --> 29:15.460]  Raycon's everyday earbuds look, feel and sound better than ever
[29:15.460 --> 29:18.360]  with optimized gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit.
[29:18.800 --> 29:21.840]  These earbuds are so comfortable and they will not budge.
[29:22.040 --> 29:26.760]  Trust me. Raycon offers three sound profiles to match what you're listening to,
[29:27.060 --> 29:29.420]  plus noise isolation and awareness mode.
[29:29.540 --> 29:31.200]  So you can choose to be immersed in sound
[29:31.200 --> 29:33.620]  or be able to hear your surroundings when you need to.
[29:34.440 --> 29:35.900]  Raycon is a great product.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.060]  Whether you're listening to music or audio books is fantastic.

[29:48.940 --> 29:50.980]  And this is a huge selling point with Raycons.
[29:51.140 --> 29:54.340]  You get the same quality of audio as other premium audio brands,
[29:54.500 --> 29:57.000]  but at half the price. Yes, really.
[29:57.440 --> 29:58.860]  But that doesn't mean they won't last.
[29:59.020 --> 30:01.760]  I've seen people talking about their Raycons falling three stories,
[30:01.920 --> 30:05.540]  getting lost in the rain and snowstorms and still working afterwards.
[30:06.100 --> 30:10.420]  It's no wonder Raycon's everyday earbuds have over 49,000 five star reviews.

[30:29.920 --> 30:33.180]  Hey, how's the how's the how's the
[30:33.890 --> 30:36.260]  like the kitchen tabletop going at your house?
[30:36.360 --> 30:38.760]  You got any any new conversations with your mom?
[30:39.120 --> 30:40.460]  No, no, I haven't.
[30:40.460 --> 30:45.160]  I haven't had and she said one thing that was really funny,
[30:45.260 --> 30:47.080]  but I don't know if it plays at all.
[30:47.240 --> 30:49.180]  So I talked to my friend.
[30:49.340 --> 30:50.220]  It's been guessed a lot.
[30:50.320 --> 30:51.900]  This person, Jake, my friend Jake.
[30:52.040 --> 30:54.040]  It's not Jake. I could tell immediately it was.
[30:54.300 --> 30:55.220]  Yeah, it's definitely not Jake.
[30:55.360 --> 30:57.620]  But he's brought it's wild to me that people even know Jake.
[30:57.700 --> 30:59.320]  Like, I don't feel like I've talked about Jake all that much.
[30:59.960 --> 31:03.100]  Jake will play games and then he will get really angry about things.
[31:03.160 --> 31:04.140]  He'll just scream things.
[31:04.280 --> 31:05.040]  He'll get very aggressive.
[31:06.320 --> 31:08.580]  And he he in a fit of rage.
[31:08.720 --> 31:09.920]  I don't remember what I was doing.
[31:09.920 --> 31:15.500]  I said I did something to him and he called my mom a cunt and anger.
[31:15.960 --> 31:20.920]  What? And he and I, I told her that in conversation.
[31:21.180 --> 31:24.300]  And so we were grocery shopping the other day as with her.
[31:24.500 --> 31:27.980]  And she was going through a tough thing, but she loves babies.
[31:28.100 --> 31:29.280]  Like she's having a bad day.
[31:29.560 --> 31:33.880]  And I noticed that the car next to me, there was a baby in it.
[31:33.980 --> 31:35.120]  I was like, oh, look at the baby.
[31:35.120 --> 31:36.060]  And the baby was feeding.
[31:36.500 --> 31:38.060]  And it was like drinking out of a bottle.
[31:38.060 --> 31:41.480]  And my mom said, I'm surprised she's not breastfeeding.
[31:41.700 --> 31:45.060]  When you were when you were a kid, they always used to say breast is best.
[31:45.140 --> 31:49.000]  And I said, I said, that's what Jake says all the time.
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.280]  Just for no reason.
[31:50.660 --> 31:54.100]  And then she immediately replied, the only breast Jake is getting is chicken.
[31:54.560 --> 32:00.620]  She doesn't like Jake now because of because of the because of the.
[32:00.740 --> 32:02.360]  And then she like cut a promo.
[32:02.620 --> 32:07.220]  She's like, and you can tell him that because I know he called me a C word.
[32:07.220 --> 32:09.240]  And I'm not a fan of that.
[32:09.340 --> 32:10.840]  So fuck Jake, essentially.
[32:11.420 --> 32:12.080]  It was just wild.
[32:12.360 --> 32:14.280]  I did not expect her to slam Jake.
[32:14.400 --> 32:16.000]  And she slammed him.
[32:16.180 --> 32:18.160]  Yes, that's probably roasted him.
[32:18.420 --> 32:20.100]  She absolutely roasted Jake.
[32:20.280 --> 32:24.220]  So that's the most recent funny conversation, I guess I've had with my mom.
[32:24.300 --> 32:27.880]  I assume she actually said the phrase C word and not the C word.
[32:28.060 --> 32:29.400]  No, she said C word.
[32:29.540 --> 32:30.660]  She didn't say the actual word.
[32:30.700 --> 32:32.620]  She says the C word. Yeah. Yeah.
[32:32.740 --> 32:34.760]  Do you think your mom has ever said that word out loud?
[32:34.760 --> 32:40.740]  No, if I if I've said it to her, if I said it in general, no, I guess.
[32:40.840 --> 32:41.160]  Never mind.
[32:41.220 --> 32:43.140]  I was going to say she'd think it was a fictitious word.
[32:43.320 --> 32:44.500]  She's very sheltered.
[32:44.500 --> 32:47.680]  But like when it comes to the language and butt plucks as established.
[32:47.840 --> 32:52.280]  But outside of that, there's not too many updates with her.
[32:52.560 --> 32:55.160]  Do you have a favorite bad director, Geoff?
[32:55.440 --> 32:56.720]  The way that I love Rennie Harlan?
[32:57.060 --> 32:58.500]  Favorite bad director?
[32:58.840 --> 33:02.240]  Like they don't make good movies, but you're a fan of their work.
[33:02.680 --> 33:03.660]  Rennie Harlan is my guy.
[33:03.660 --> 33:06.640]  He made Die Hard 2, The Long Kiss Good Night.
[33:06.880 --> 33:09.820]  One of my favorite movies ever, just due to how bad it is.
[33:09.940 --> 33:11.460]  Mind Hunters. Fantastic.
[33:12.080 --> 33:13.500]  12 Rounds with John Cena.
[33:13.960 --> 33:15.940]  One of the great WWE movies.
[33:16.400 --> 33:17.760]  Cliffhanger. Cliffhanger.
[33:17.900 --> 33:19.220]  Like all he does is schlock.
[33:20.280 --> 33:22.840]  I guess it depends on what you consider bad.
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.760]  Like one of my favorite directors for my entire life.
[33:26.820 --> 33:28.680]  And I guess could fit into that category.
[33:29.040 --> 33:30.540]  But I don't think he's a bad director at all.
[33:30.560 --> 33:31.180]  I think he's brilliant.
[33:31.460 --> 33:33.480]  I think what he's doing is brilliant satire.
[33:33.660 --> 33:34.940]  But I would say John Waters.
[33:35.320 --> 33:37.860]  You know, but I think a lot of people have trouble watching John Waters films.
[33:37.980 --> 33:40.560]  But I'm a huge, huge, huge John Waters fan.
[33:40.740 --> 33:41.540]  He's a great director.
[33:41.740 --> 33:46.200]  Yeah. But I mean, you know, you show Pink Flamingos to 10 people
[33:46.200 --> 33:48.000]  and 10 out of 10 are going to say it's a bad movie.
[33:48.240 --> 33:49.080]  It's a tough. Yeah.
[33:49.380 --> 33:52.920]  I was so I've seen all of the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies.
[33:52.980 --> 33:56.620]  And in the last one they made, John Waters has a cameo in it.
[33:56.660 --> 33:58.040]  And I don't know who that was for.
[33:58.320 --> 34:00.540]  It was one of the strangest cameos I've ever seen.
[34:01.080 --> 34:03.640]  Like Alvin is on the plane and John Waters is there.
[34:03.640 --> 34:06.020]  As John Waters. And it's like, you're John Waters.
[34:06.120 --> 34:08.000]  And I'm like, who the fuck? Why is he here?
[34:08.260 --> 34:09.700]  Like, it's great. I love him.
[34:09.820 --> 34:11.220]  That's awesome. He's getting paid.
[34:11.440 --> 34:14.680]  And a kid's like in a kid's movie that came out like 2016.
[34:15.260 --> 34:17.800]  Like, what is why is John Waters?
[34:18.480 --> 34:20.440]  It's sort of like the tuxedo with James Brown.
[34:20.620 --> 34:23.580]  Like, I'd love to know why that cameo.
[34:23.760 --> 34:24.760]  Like, what was the choice?
[34:25.300 --> 34:26.860]  That's one of my questions for Kevin Donovan.
[34:26.980 --> 34:27.780]  Still haven't heard back.
[34:28.040 --> 34:29.480]  We're still waiting. Maybe one day.
[34:29.640 --> 34:30.420]  Yeah, I'm sure he's busy.
[34:30.800 --> 34:32.640]  I. Oh, go ahead, Geoff.
[34:32.640 --> 34:34.640]  I was going to ask Gavin if he had a favorite bad director.
[34:34.920 --> 34:35.980]  Yeah, I couldn't really think of it, could I?
[34:36.240 --> 34:40.420]  I was saying like Brett Ratner sucks, but I've enjoyed Rush Hour and stuff.
[34:40.840 --> 34:43.980]  Although, nah, like X-Men 3 was a piece of dog shit.
[34:44.380 --> 34:45.020]  It wasn't even enjoyable.
[34:45.240 --> 34:46.240]  It was. No, it wasn't.
[34:46.240 --> 34:47.360]  It was not good. Not good.
[34:47.560 --> 34:50.540]  So last episode, we had Dodge the Bov.
[34:50.920 --> 34:54.240]  That was that was a big game because this all started because Geoff, you called me out.
[34:54.380 --> 34:55.520]  You said I didn't have the content.
[34:55.700 --> 34:56.900]  I wasn't. I didn't bring anything.
[34:57.280 --> 35:00.100]  So I wanted to make sure I had games for the next time we recorded.
[35:00.540 --> 35:01.960]  We did Dodge the Bov.
[35:02.360 --> 35:04.400]  Game one. I got game two for you.
[35:04.460 --> 35:07.080]  This is an exciting thing that I came up with.
[35:07.240 --> 35:11.060]  I got to say that one minor throwaway joke
[35:11.060 --> 35:14.140]  I made just to get under your skin at the last minute
[35:14.140 --> 35:18.760]  right before I shut down the podcast and you couldn't retaliate has really bore.
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.460]  No, I just want to. You know what?
[35:20.460 --> 35:21.160]  You made me reflect.
[35:21.240 --> 35:23.300]  So I want to make sure I had games for this one.
[35:23.320 --> 35:26.500]  As stated, I'm going to need some assistance immediately.
[35:26.680 --> 35:27.980]  Gavin, what was the name?
[35:27.980 --> 35:31.380]  You remember when you'd walk in the snow and you'd see if there are footprints
[35:31.380 --> 35:32.500]  if somebody died?
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.460]  Guess who's dead?
[35:33.600 --> 35:34.560]  Guess who's dead?
[35:34.700 --> 35:36.340]  This is guess who's dead.
[35:36.700 --> 35:38.360]  Round two. Guess who might be dead.
[35:38.420 --> 35:38.820]  I think it was.
[35:39.100 --> 35:40.360]  Guess who might be dead.
[35:40.500 --> 35:42.760]  Round two. The movie version.
[35:43.380 --> 35:44.680]  So I was I was.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.460]  I don't know. I don't remember where I was, but I saw online an image for,
[35:49.600 --> 35:54.020]  I guess, Anaconda just turned 25 years old, like within the last two weeks.
[35:54.300 --> 35:57.440]  Great. The 25th anniversary of that release.
[35:57.440 --> 35:59.300]  And it is a fantastic movie.
[35:59.520 --> 36:00.920]  And so I clicked it.
[36:01.180 --> 36:04.260]  Eric Stoltz eats a bug and then he can't and then he just disappears in the movie.
[36:04.500 --> 36:06.940]  He does. But he lives.
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.400]  Yeah. So this was the image they used for the article of Anaconda
[36:11.400 --> 36:13.400]  has turned 25 years old.
[36:13.740 --> 36:15.500]  I'll post it right now. We're an audio show.
[36:15.660 --> 36:16.880]  I will describe it.
[36:17.380 --> 36:19.500]  It is J-Lo reaching out.
[36:19.600 --> 36:22.500]  Not really minimal effort, I would say at this point.
[36:22.500 --> 36:27.500]  An ice cube is surrounded by an anaconda screaming in pain.
[36:27.760 --> 36:30.000]  Yeah, yeah. If you were to look at that photo,
[36:30.640 --> 36:33.940]  you would think definitively that there's no way that Ice Cube
[36:33.940 --> 36:35.300]  would get out of that situation.
[36:36.100 --> 36:38.180]  Yet he did. He survived.
[36:38.540 --> 36:39.660]  He survives in that movie.
[36:40.040 --> 36:42.300]  So I figured I would take some photos.
[36:42.980 --> 36:44.120]  I blanked the name of the game.
[36:44.220 --> 36:45.480]  Gab was the look who's dead.
[36:45.880 --> 36:47.920]  Guess who? Guess who might be dead, too.
[36:48.140 --> 36:51.100]  I have taken some moments from a movie.
[36:51.100 --> 36:53.260]  I will post the photo, describe the photo.
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.760]  I'll say the character name, say the actor name.
[36:56.220 --> 36:58.340]  And you can tell me if you think that they died or not.
[36:58.400 --> 36:59.580]  OK. In that scene.
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.320]  And well, not necessarily in that scene.
[37:01.520 --> 37:03.080]  It's a it could be maybe later.
[37:03.260 --> 37:04.860]  So they just have to survive the movie or not.
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.160]  Survive the movie or not.
[37:06.420 --> 37:09.220]  But these are all moments in which you look at it.
[37:09.300 --> 37:10.860]  You go, oh, that doesn't look too good.
[37:11.100 --> 37:11.800]  Maybe they lived.
[37:11.920 --> 37:13.520]  What if a character comes back to life?
[37:13.560 --> 37:14.780]  Does that count as they died?
[37:15.020 --> 37:17.140]  Well, maybe. I don't know.
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.040]  I will encounter that, I guess, when we encounter it.
[37:19.040 --> 37:20.040]  So next one is deep.
[37:20.340 --> 37:21.800]  Blue Sea is the film.
[37:21.980 --> 37:27.320]  The character's name is Jim Whitlock, played by Stellan Skarsgård.
[37:27.340 --> 37:28.700]  He's got his hand out there. Big shark.
[37:29.040 --> 37:31.080]  Big shark's about the looks like he's going to bite his hand.
[37:31.460 --> 37:33.320]  Does he die? Does he live? Does he die?
[37:33.660 --> 37:34.380]  I'm going to say yes.
[37:34.700 --> 37:36.460]  Yes, he dies. He dies.
[37:36.640 --> 37:39.380]  Yeah, I think just because almost every single person dies.
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.240]  I think I think it was LL Cool J in that one.
[37:42.620 --> 37:43.800]  Didn't he hide in a wasn't he?
[37:43.920 --> 37:45.360]  He did. He had another.
[37:45.860 --> 37:47.640]  Yeah. He's a chef. He is a parrot.
[37:47.640 --> 37:49.400]  He was he was in that film.
[37:49.600 --> 37:51.980]  So everybody's saying that he lived or he died.
[37:52.140 --> 37:53.040]  Sorry. Yeah. You think he's dead?
[37:53.420 --> 37:55.540]  That is correct. Everybody gets a point for Deep Blue Sea.
[37:55.760 --> 37:59.460]  Do you do you post the next screenshot of him actually being killed?
[37:59.660 --> 38:03.380]  No, I don't, because it's it's it's extremely, extremely graphic.
[38:03.600 --> 38:05.940]  All of the stuff that is related to his death.
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.300]  Kind of a trend you'll find.
[38:09.900 --> 38:12.500]  The next movie we're pulling a classic classic film.
[38:12.560 --> 38:14.780]  Big franchise. Mission Impossible one.
[38:15.440 --> 38:16.800]  We have Emilio.
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.420]  We have Jack Harmon played by Emilio Estevez in a film.
[38:22.100 --> 38:23.500]  He's he's in an elevator.
[38:23.720 --> 38:25.900]  The elevator gets hacked. It's going up.
[38:26.160 --> 38:27.360]  He's stuck on top of it.
[38:27.660 --> 38:28.800]  The thing pops out.
[38:29.100 --> 38:30.480]  Does Jack Harmon live?
[38:30.900 --> 38:32.300]  Killed by a guy in Anaconda.
[38:32.500 --> 38:34.080]  That is that is a pole.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.880]  He dies instantly right there.
[38:36.400 --> 38:37.580]  He dies. It does.
[38:37.720 --> 38:39.160]  He dies like three frames from now.
[38:39.720 --> 38:41.880]  He does. It's the three three.
[38:42.020 --> 38:44.300]  So everybody that's at this point for everybody.
[38:44.300 --> 38:46.060]  Yeah, three three frame death.
[38:46.180 --> 38:50.120]  OK, now we're going to go to the next film on.
[38:50.680 --> 38:51.940]  Is he is he dead?
[38:52.080 --> 38:52.660]  I like this game.
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.640]  Volume volume two. You're a big fan of this game.
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.100]  Yeah. The next film is Jesus Christ Superstar.
[39:00.020 --> 39:02.500]  This fella's got himself in a real predicament.
[39:04.500 --> 39:05.540]  Stuck out there.
[39:06.500 --> 39:08.320]  My question was so valid.
[39:09.560 --> 39:12.240]  The character name is Jesus Christ
[39:12.760 --> 39:15.440]  and the character, the actor named Ted Neely.
[39:17.660 --> 39:19.480]  Gavin, go. You go ahead and go.
[39:20.200 --> 39:23.260]  Andrew, was this the part of the show that you said we might have to cut?
[39:23.920 --> 39:25.440]  Yeah, yeah, it was.
[39:25.920 --> 39:28.280]  I mean, he he dies for a while.
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.020]  Yeah, I don't I don't necessarily know how to answer this one.
[39:32.540 --> 39:36.880]  I don't think it could work both ways.
[39:37.420 --> 39:39.720]  I'm going to say yes. Yeah, I think that's OK.
[39:39.860 --> 39:40.600]  I think that's correct.
[39:40.600 --> 39:41.840]  I think you all get points.
[39:42.080 --> 39:43.220]  And and that is the game.
[39:43.260 --> 39:45.280]  That is the end of round one.
[39:46.780 --> 39:49.200]  Is he dead to part two?
[39:50.160 --> 39:51.320]  Oh, my God.
[39:51.440 --> 39:52.900]  You mean guess who might be dead?
[39:53.120 --> 39:54.300]  Guess who might be dead?
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.040]  Volume two. That's what it was.
[39:56.220 --> 39:58.440]  I can't wait for us to play that again.
[39:59.720 --> 40:02.180]  Man, I wanted to make sure I had games
[40:02.180 --> 40:04.120]  because Geoff brought up that I didn't have a thing.
[40:04.140 --> 40:05.460]  So I want to make sure I had a thing.
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.520]  I was guessing he's dead. Volume two.
[40:07.680 --> 40:08.860]  I was thinking of characters
[40:09.480 --> 40:11.180]  who have died and came back to life.
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.240]  Like I was thinking in my head of like Rachel Weisz in the second Mummy movie.
[40:16.780 --> 40:18.660]  And then you put up Jesus.
[40:20.280 --> 40:22.300]  I didn't know how to classify that one.
[40:22.420 --> 40:25.540]  I was generally just kind of excited to hear what you guys thought.
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.020]  Oh, I think it's a great game.
[40:29.980 --> 40:30.900]  Oh, you really
[40:32.300 --> 40:34.880]  you really knocked it out of the park on that one.
[40:35.340 --> 40:38.780]  I hope I hope the religious audience doesn't crucify
[40:38.780 --> 40:42.200]  you for it. Oh, hey.
[40:43.080 --> 40:45.680]  Oh, man. I was just I wanted to make sure I had a game.
[40:45.860 --> 40:47.180]  I just wanted to contribute.
[40:47.460 --> 40:49.380]  Make sure. Oh, that tickled me.
[40:49.420 --> 40:51.520]  Eric is live again. Why are you streaming again, Eric?
[40:51.560 --> 40:52.260]  What do we got going on now?
[40:52.280 --> 40:54.700]  Oh, Eric just purchased a shirt.
[40:54.960 --> 40:56.440]  Are you fucking serious already?
[40:56.880 --> 40:58.340]  So they asked who wanted them.
[40:58.440 --> 41:00.260]  And I said all five of us. Yes.
[41:00.440 --> 41:03.060]  So we you should be getting confirmation email shortly.
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.040]  So we will be getting the face anal passage.
[41:08.940 --> 41:09.900]  God damn it.
[41:10.120 --> 41:11.460]  I it's the greatest thing.
[41:11.640 --> 41:13.600]  I just looked in the merch slack when you said it.
[41:13.620 --> 41:16.240]  Want to remake this shirt, but make it say anal passage.
[41:16.420 --> 41:19.000]  And Tony just said, is that an official wish?
[41:22.740 --> 41:24.560]  Oh, man. Official wish.
[41:25.860 --> 41:27.800]  Wish granted. We got it.
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.880]  Oh, I got my confirmation email, too.
[41:33.340 --> 41:34.580]  We should all have them now.
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.300]  We should all have that shirt very soon.
[41:36.300 --> 41:41.220]  This is what an insane way to come back to this show,
[41:41.220 --> 41:45.440]  to have a piece, to go up in half an hour.
[41:45.540 --> 41:50.640]  And like, yeah, and by the time people hear this, I don't think they can get it.
[41:50.780 --> 41:53.320]  No, it's going to be a weird thing where we could open.
[41:53.700 --> 41:55.980]  This is genuinely a previously on episode.
[41:56.460 --> 42:00.000]  Yeah, everything that they've listened to is an event that happened prior to
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.660]  that they cannot experience anymore.
[42:01.840 --> 42:05.320]  You know, when I was in London, I had a day where it was
[42:05.320 --> 42:07.360]  quite a sunny, gorgeous day.
[42:07.440 --> 42:10.640]  And I was walking around Hyde Park and just kind of
[42:11.340 --> 42:13.920]  taking in the the greenery.
[42:14.580 --> 42:18.200]  And I got quite reflective thinking about the fact
[42:18.200 --> 42:21.000]  that we had just done 100 episodes of F*** Face.
[42:21.080 --> 42:23.100]  And I was really nervous about episode 100.
[42:23.440 --> 42:25.040]  Turned out my fears were unwarranted.
[42:25.420 --> 42:27.860]  I was just like, anytime I'm like I'm working on a bit
[42:27.860 --> 42:31.540]  and my attention's a little divided, I never know.
[42:31.760 --> 42:34.400]  I don't have a good handle on whether it was a good or not.
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.860]  And so I like I think I immediately I was one of those podcasts
[42:36.860 --> 42:40.600]  where I immediately hit up Andrew and Gavin and was like, tell me it was good,
[42:41.020 --> 42:41.900]  you know, because I don't know.
[42:42.060 --> 42:44.980]  And then so I was like wondering if people were going to dig it or not.
[42:45.100 --> 42:48.580]  And and then I was just thinking about like everything that we've done
[42:48.580 --> 42:54.280]  in 100 episodes and how it almost felt like a complete book ended story.
[42:54.740 --> 42:59.620]  And then I was thinking like, what is 100 on one on going to be like?
[42:59.940 --> 43:01.300]  And I really had no idea.
[43:01.300 --> 43:04.200]  I felt like for a while there, I kind of have a handle on things.
[43:04.200 --> 43:06.360]  And then we're kind of entering into uncharted territory.
[43:06.460 --> 43:08.980]  It was like a process to get us to 100.
[43:09.280 --> 43:11.820]  And then you like sit back and you're like, well, I don't know where the fuck
[43:11.820 --> 43:13.000]  we're going with this thing now.
[43:13.380 --> 43:14.660]  Couldn't have guessed any of this.
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.960]  Yeah. Anal passage and is Jesus die?
[43:20.040 --> 43:22.720]  Damn. It just keeps on.
[43:22.800 --> 43:25.360]  It's as much as it's a surprise to the audience.
[43:25.360 --> 43:27.500]  It is as much so to me as well.
[43:27.620 --> 43:31.860]  I didn't think I would puke one episode after like as soon as we finished 100.
[43:31.860 --> 43:35.200]  My immediate thought wasn't I'm going to vomit next episode.
[43:35.520 --> 43:36.640]  That would have been high on my face.
[43:36.740 --> 43:38.580]  Bingo card actually was you vomit. Really?
[43:39.380 --> 43:40.240]  Yeah, that's pretty.
[43:40.380 --> 43:42.540]  That's like the fifth time an episode is ended that way.
[43:42.600 --> 43:43.960]  And it's still great every time.
[43:44.400 --> 43:47.940]  Best way to end an episode is with your audible discomfort.
[43:48.120 --> 43:50.100]  Did you have fun in Hyde Park? Yeah, dude.
[43:50.180 --> 43:52.060]  That place is awesome. I like London a lot.
[43:52.140 --> 43:53.540]  Did you have as much fun as this?
[43:54.940 --> 43:57.000]  Oh, I didn't remember.
[43:58.160 --> 44:00.320]  I'll be honest, I don't remember doing that.
[44:00.320 --> 44:02.780]  You don't remember the pedal boat in Hyde Park?
[44:04.240 --> 44:07.940]  I guess I how that must have been a million years ago.
[44:08.300 --> 44:12.160]  Eric brings up a great point of you are wearing two pairs of sunglasses, Geoff.
[44:13.580 --> 44:15.240]  There was probably a reason for that.
[44:15.540 --> 44:16.620]  Oh, that's so cute.
[44:16.900 --> 44:18.220]  20 July 2010.
[44:18.560 --> 44:19.740]  Look at us so much younger.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.700]  Ah, they weren't running the boats while I was there, but I will.
[44:22.740 --> 44:24.240]  I walked right by that spot, actually.
[44:25.480 --> 44:26.660]  Where does the time go?
[44:27.680 --> 44:28.780]  One of us aged well.
[44:28.780 --> 44:30.140]  We're almost at two years.
[44:30.480 --> 44:33.640]  Yeah, I think people figured out that 2037 would be episode 1000.
[44:34.520 --> 44:36.320]  Like late, late summer.
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.320]  2037 or 2037 or 2039.
[44:40.520 --> 44:41.040]  Oh, my God.
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.960]  Maybe God, I was I was reading the comments on episode 100 on the on the Roosties site.
[44:46.080 --> 44:49.360]  And somebody mentioned was like, I don't know if I'll be around
[44:49.360 --> 44:52.280]  for episode 1000 because I'm almost 70 now.
[44:52.740 --> 44:53.820]  But I hope so.
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.460]  And I was like, I messaged him.
[44:55.500 --> 44:57.740]  I'm like, you better fucking be around for episode 1000.
[44:57.740 --> 45:00.320]  Like, I'll I'll put some money into keeping you alive.
[45:00.420 --> 45:03.820]  But the idea that we have somebody who's listening to the show on purpose
[45:03.820 --> 45:07.080]  who's almost 70 just warms my fucking heart.
[45:07.240 --> 45:09.960]  And it just means that we appeal to all ages of degenerate.
[45:10.060 --> 45:10.940]  I love it.
[45:11.040 --> 45:11.680]  You think that's real?
[45:11.960 --> 45:13.240]  I assume so. I don't know.
[45:13.460 --> 45:15.460]  Why would somebody lie about their age going that way?
[45:15.660 --> 45:17.300]  I don't know. You have doubt, Gavin?
[45:17.600 --> 45:17.920]  Yeah.
[45:24.580 --> 45:27.540]  I wonder who is the oldest listener.
[45:27.540 --> 45:29.780]  Well, let's get him a shirt and they can buy it.
[45:29.940 --> 45:31.060]  And I wonder who it is.
[45:31.260 --> 45:34.240]  We should get his shirt says oldest listener, but only one person can buy it.
[45:34.540 --> 45:35.840]  Yeah. And they have to.
[45:36.200 --> 45:39.800]  If there's an older listener comes along, they have to mail it to that person.
[45:43.900 --> 45:44.720]  Oh, man.
[45:45.360 --> 45:48.000]  Oh, Gavin, you know, another comment I saw that was pretty interesting.
[45:48.080 --> 45:51.820]  I know we talked about it last episode, but you told what is got to be
[45:51.820 --> 45:57.600]  I don't know, top five moment in in of all time on this show,
[45:57.640 --> 46:01.820]  which was your bloody pier story in Melbourne, Australia.
[46:02.060 --> 46:03.760]  The blood wind. The blood wind. Yeah.
[46:04.060 --> 46:08.020]  And somebody said that guy was probably saw you alone on the pier.
[46:08.120 --> 46:09.740]  It was probably coming to rob you.
[46:09.780 --> 46:13.920]  And you got extremely lucky and they they pieced out of there
[46:13.920 --> 46:16.200]  because their plan was foiled.
[46:16.200 --> 46:18.700]  And I thought, I kind of hope that's true.
[46:18.700 --> 46:20.340]  I kind of hope you dodged that bullet.
[46:20.340 --> 46:24.840]  If I was about to get mugged at nine in the morning on the pier in Melbourne.
[46:25.320 --> 46:26.720]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's possible.
[46:27.220 --> 46:30.840]  And then the gust of wind saved me from like 10 feet away.
[46:31.740 --> 46:33.340]  Divine intervention. Yeah. Yeah.
[46:33.760 --> 46:35.940]  Yeah. I saw that comment. It's pretty funny.
[46:36.360 --> 46:38.600]  Is there any other you don't have to say it.
[46:38.900 --> 46:43.100]  Is there any other stories like that that you've been on the fence about telling?
[46:43.540 --> 46:44.140]  Or is that it?
[46:44.780 --> 46:47.560]  I don't know. It's hard to tell which ones I've told on the other podcasts.
[46:47.560 --> 46:48.880]  I mean, that's fair.
[46:49.380 --> 46:51.520]  Yeah. I have to like try and remember what I've told.
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.280]  I just meant in general, like that was a story that you had never told.
[46:55.420 --> 46:57.620]  Like that was just never been said before.
[46:57.780 --> 47:00.120]  And I'm probably not sitting on anything as heavy as that one.
[47:00.280 --> 47:02.280]  Yeah. That's what I was curious about.
[47:02.520 --> 47:07.400]  I'm trying to think if I because I remember when we started the show,
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.000]  I had like 30 you talking about, Geoff, like we're trying to get to 100.
[47:11.460 --> 47:14.200]  I think when we started, I had an outline of 30 things
[47:14.200 --> 47:16.100]  that I felt confident I could talk about.
[47:16.100 --> 47:19.160]  That could be like, maybe be an episode like 30 episodes.
[47:19.500 --> 47:22.740]  So the premise of us hitting 100 was definitely for me.
[47:22.800 --> 47:26.460]  Like, how the fuck are we going to let you just have to not tell a story
[47:26.460 --> 47:27.440]  every two episodes?
[47:27.700 --> 47:29.700]  Yeah. Or just like, OK, I've got 30.
[47:29.800 --> 47:31.720]  I feel really good about the next 30.
[47:32.400 --> 47:34.120]  I don't know what will come after that.
[47:34.420 --> 47:37.560]  That's why things like the pencil trial at the time were like, oh, my God,
[47:37.560 --> 47:40.240]  this is like an episode and this isn't part of the 30.
[47:40.540 --> 47:41.540]  Yeah. It's like a free one.
[47:41.840 --> 47:45.380]  Yeah. Like, especially for me when I was first starting of like
[47:45.380 --> 47:49.740]  trying to get comfortability in doing this and having any confidence at all
[47:49.740 --> 47:54.560]  and like telling a story or just just talking in general on a show like this.
[47:54.580 --> 47:56.640]  It was very much like I have this list of 30.
[47:56.880 --> 47:58.080]  I feel confident about this.
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.980]  But this is ideally going to last longer than 30 episodes.
[48:01.520 --> 48:02.580]  How are we going to make this work?
[48:02.640 --> 48:04.260]  So those opportunities would come up.
[48:04.660 --> 48:08.140]  I remember one of the first episodes like we were, we established
[48:08.140 --> 48:12.940]  being terrible at intros and outros very early on in the show.
[48:12.940 --> 48:14.920]  I want to say like episode six.
[48:15.180 --> 48:18.680]  I opened is very early episode around there.
[48:19.140 --> 48:21.800]  Episode six. I opened the show with the outro.
[48:22.240 --> 48:25.180]  Like I did. I was like, well, we're always bad at this,
[48:25.200 --> 48:26.840]  so we might as well just do it at the beginning
[48:26.840 --> 48:29.060]  so we at least have a good outro we could use.
[48:30.340 --> 48:30.980]  Absolutely terrifying.
[48:31.360 --> 48:33.180]  I think that's the first time in the show where I was like,
[48:33.220 --> 48:36.260]  I'm going to do a thing without talking to you guys about it that I don't know.
[48:36.280 --> 48:38.540]  It's just like a funny idea in my head. Did we love it?
[48:38.680 --> 48:42.520]  Yeah, it played well, but it was like I was so nervous in doing that.
[48:42.520 --> 48:43.380]  Like it was just scary.
[48:43.500 --> 48:46.360]  The premise of like holding the ball or like doing a thing
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.400]  that I hadn't already told a bunch of people and knew would work comedically.
[48:50.800 --> 48:53.580]  We've really played with the medium when it comes to intros and outros.
[48:53.820 --> 48:55.180]  Like you did the outro at the beginning.
[48:55.660 --> 49:00.340]  We did the one where you did the intro at the end of the previous episode.
[49:01.020 --> 49:04.880]  We threw the ball. Yeah, I feel like we've really innovated
[49:04.880 --> 49:06.120]  in the intro and outro space.
[49:06.180 --> 49:09.420]  That was one of them where Geoff and I or Geoff's doing the intro
[49:09.420 --> 49:12.180]  and you're trying to stop him saying that there's already an intro
[49:12.180 --> 49:15.440]  for this one because you've done you've done like the legal trial
[49:15.440 --> 49:16.700]  on your own before we arrived.
[49:16.820 --> 49:19.300]  So it's just you arguing with Geoff for like five minutes.
[49:19.540 --> 49:21.980]  Yeah, we've done some great things.
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.500]  I've swayed back and forth on the importance of intros and outros.
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.040]  I feel like we're better at them now.
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.340]  I think so. I feel like it's sort of just a standard intro, standard outro.
[49:31.580 --> 49:32.560]  Eric, you don't think we're better?
[49:32.740 --> 49:35.900]  No, I don't think I don't think there's been any improvement whatsoever.
[49:38.160 --> 49:41.060]  That was hard, hard indignation.
[49:41.060 --> 49:44.100]  Yeah, you could go back and listen to the beginning of this podcast
[49:44.100 --> 49:49.240]  and probably feel about the same as what they are now.
[49:49.380 --> 49:52.740]  I don't like you played with the medium.
[49:52.840 --> 49:55.200]  What are you talking about?
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.740]  A little bit non-linear.
[49:57.920 --> 49:59.880]  But how? Of intros and outros?
[50:01.120 --> 50:03.780]  I feel like we've we've done some things that...
[50:03.780 --> 50:06.300]  Like you're trying to start the podcast in media res?
[50:06.400 --> 50:07.840]  Like, what are you talking about?
[50:07.840 --> 50:09.600]  Like what? Played with the...
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.200]  We've done great things and innovated out of control.
[50:13.640 --> 50:14.340]  This is outrageous.
[50:14.500 --> 50:16.920]  I think we got some of the most advanced intros.
[50:18.500 --> 50:24.120]  No, we've not got bog standard intros.
[50:24.360 --> 50:25.440]  Mainly thanks to Andrew.
[50:25.640 --> 50:26.500]  I think that's undeniable.
[50:27.040 --> 50:27.980]  That would be the issue.
[50:29.180 --> 50:32.280]  Right. What you said and what I said are the same thing.
[50:34.240 --> 50:34.960]  Oh, yeah.
[50:35.220 --> 50:36.500]  Oh, you guys moved quite a bit.
[50:36.500 --> 50:37.920]  I don't fight the intro anymore.
[50:38.280 --> 50:39.380]  I no longer do that.
[50:39.720 --> 50:42.680]  There's a period of time which I thought the intro was completely unnecessary.
[50:43.200 --> 50:46.440]  Why? Well, OK, I think with this show specifically,
[50:46.960 --> 50:49.660]  you have zero context for anything that ever happens.
[50:49.780 --> 50:51.140]  Like we don't we don't set up.
[50:51.260 --> 50:52.980]  It's not like a singular...
[50:52.980 --> 50:54.180]  Are we in season one again?
[50:54.360 --> 50:56.920]  Is it possible to go from season four to season one?
[50:57.740 --> 51:00.480]  Then we'll be really playing with a medium of seasons.
[51:01.320 --> 51:02.200]  We're regressing.
[51:02.620 --> 51:04.360]  Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
[51:04.360 --> 51:06.560]  Eric, did you fix the site, by the way, to display?
[51:06.880 --> 51:08.680]  Oh, yeah. Fucking right.
[51:09.060 --> 51:11.660]  I do. Do you like the amount of work?
[51:11.840 --> 51:13.180]  Oh, this is insane.
[51:13.260 --> 51:15.160]  We got to do is just file them into different seasons.
[51:15.420 --> 51:19.360]  We should just pay a kid to fix the whole thing in like 72 hours.
[51:19.460 --> 51:20.160]  Like, I'll do it.
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.140]  Give me give me permission to organize space into seasons on our site.
[51:24.180 --> 51:25.340]  And I'll do it. Yeah, go for it.
[51:25.420 --> 51:26.640]  You got it. OK, permission.
[51:26.720 --> 51:27.640]  Hey, permission granted.
[51:27.640 --> 51:29.120]  I don't mean verbal permission.
[51:29.240 --> 51:30.560]  I did this for us.
[51:31.120 --> 51:31.480]  Congratulations.
[51:31.480 --> 51:36.180]  You're a literal site eligible to go on and fix some stuff.
[51:36.280 --> 51:36.900]  Go nuts, buddy.
[51:37.700 --> 51:38.640]  God bless.
[51:38.920 --> 51:42.920]  It's like it's like giving a child a toy car wheel and telling him he's driving.
[51:43.100 --> 51:43.720]  Is what just happened?
[51:44.900 --> 51:46.760]  Go have fun and do some laps.
[51:47.420 --> 51:48.460]  I'll be here.
[51:49.500 --> 51:51.500]  He gave me verbal permission.
[51:51.960 --> 51:52.500]  Thanks, Eric.
[51:54.680 --> 51:58.820]  God damn. Hey, by the way, Andrew, we haven't talked about it, but how?
[51:59.260 --> 52:00.600]  I hope time to give the dog his pill.
[52:01.460 --> 52:04.700]  Uh, how are you enjoying this season of Survivor?
[52:04.780 --> 52:05.940]  I keep meaning to ask you.
[52:06.160 --> 52:07.960]  Yeah, it's been great.
[52:08.080 --> 52:11.260]  I think overall, like a few hit or miss episodes.
[52:11.580 --> 52:14.640]  But I think generally speaking, it's been a really good season.
[52:14.880 --> 52:17.100]  It's a huge improvement on season 41.
[52:17.300 --> 52:20.480]  I feel like they took every new mechanic and tweaked it and improved it.
[52:20.740 --> 52:22.960]  Well, they filmed them both at the same time.
[52:23.020 --> 52:25.060]  So like, I think like it has.
[52:25.280 --> 52:26.300]  Yeah, like the cat.
[52:26.480 --> 52:27.340]  I don't understand.
[52:27.340 --> 52:29.280]  So they have the shot in the dark mechanic.
[52:29.580 --> 52:32.560]  And one of the more recent episodes, Geoff Probst is like,
[52:32.660 --> 52:36.020]  we've changed it from a one and six to a two and twelve.
[52:36.260 --> 52:37.140]  And I was like, well, it's the point.
[52:37.280 --> 52:38.600]  I don't understand why you've done. Yeah.
[52:38.860 --> 52:40.060]  I didn't quite the same odds either.
[52:40.260 --> 52:42.180]  And I don't I don't get why they they flipped that.
[52:42.240 --> 52:44.540]  What I'm excited about. Take it back to where we started.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.440]  They are now like CBS is doing a version of the challenge
[52:48.440 --> 52:52.420]  that is like a team of Survivor contestants, a team of Big Brother,
[52:52.820 --> 52:53.920]  a team of the challenge.
[52:53.920 --> 52:57.300]  Like it's a show where it's like different groups, like clearly defined.
[52:58.020 --> 53:01.020]  Jonathan, who's on this season of Survivor, is 100 percent
[53:01.020 --> 53:01.920]  going to be on the challenge.
[53:02.020 --> 53:03.240]  And I cannot wait to see that.
[53:03.560 --> 53:04.980]  You'll be so great on that show.
[53:05.380 --> 53:07.200]  It's just it's like such a perfect fit for him.
[53:07.240 --> 53:08.140]  I don't know why he wouldn't.
[53:08.240 --> 53:09.580]  And I don't know why they wouldn't ask him.
[53:09.700 --> 53:11.000]  The guy's a beast.
[53:11.240 --> 53:12.320]  Are you watching the season, Gav?
[53:12.340 --> 53:13.460]  Are you finally catching up? Yeah.
[53:13.580 --> 53:17.220]  And I'm pretty sure that he said that because there's two tribes before, isn't it?
[53:17.440 --> 53:20.080]  So they would have had to have been the one in six chance.
[53:20.360 --> 53:21.360]  But now everyone's merged.
[53:21.380 --> 53:22.260]  So it's like a two in.
[53:22.260 --> 53:24.960]  He's saying the odds are the same, but there's there's more.
[53:25.260 --> 53:28.060]  Yeah, I guess we've never seen a scenario where like five people have attempted
[53:28.060 --> 53:29.580]  to shot in the dark at the same time.
[53:29.680 --> 53:33.320]  Yeah, he's got to be the most physically dominant
[53:34.760 --> 53:36.200]  contestant in the history of Survivor, right?
[53:36.280 --> 53:38.300]  I mean, like Ozzy was really good.
[53:38.580 --> 53:41.400]  He does entire tribe challenges on his own.
[53:41.460 --> 53:42.700]  He was like throwing people.
[53:42.880 --> 53:44.860]  Yeah, he just does everything himself and wins.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  It's like everyone else is irrelevant.
[53:46.300 --> 53:49.780]  He did that one challenge in the water where they just had to shut the challenge
[53:49.780 --> 53:53.020]  down. He was like he did it by himself and then everybody else would drown.
[53:53.060 --> 53:56.180]  Yeah. And then there was that one just recently where the other team
[53:56.180 --> 53:59.140]  had like four balls in the hoop and his team had none.
[53:59.280 --> 54:02.420]  So he just climbed out of the water and threw five balls in and it was over.
[54:02.680 --> 54:05.100]  That episode where he and Mike are like having that.
[54:05.160 --> 54:06.840]  I don't know. I feel like maybe we even talked about this already.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.960]  But having that conversation, they're bonding over how hard it is to have muscles.
[54:11.180 --> 54:12.900]  Yes. Yeah, that's right.
[54:12.940 --> 54:14.020]  I'm so glad you brought that up.
[54:14.240 --> 54:18.220]  One of, I think, the funniest things in Survivor ever has been this season
[54:18.220 --> 54:21.460]  that Mike keeps putting himself in the same category as Jonathan.
[54:21.720 --> 54:23.440]  I love it. And he always does it.
[54:23.560 --> 54:27.140]  He's like, yeah, they always target the big guys like Jonathan and I.
[54:27.240 --> 54:29.640]  And it's like, you are not you're in a different league.
[54:30.020 --> 54:35.400]  I really liked the guy who went home, but he kept dropping shit and losing shit.
[54:35.480 --> 54:37.480]  And he like dropped Mike's side on the floor.
[54:37.560 --> 54:39.700]  I was like, you never gave it to me.
[54:39.860 --> 54:42.260]  I gave it back to you. It was just on the floor in the open.
[54:44.360 --> 54:49.660]  Yeah, my favorite challenge thing, like as far as dominant people on the show goes,
[54:49.720 --> 54:52.140]  there's this guy named James who is in a bunch of seasons
[54:52.140 --> 54:54.760]  who had the fantastic job as grave digger.
[54:54.980 --> 54:56.880]  And he was just jacked.
[54:56.920 --> 54:58.640]  And they had this challenge where you're in the water.
[54:58.900 --> 55:03.040]  And the idea was you had two poles and you'd have two people in the water
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.780]  hold the poles and the person would step on one and then move to the other.
[55:07.860 --> 55:09.840]  And the person with the pole, like they just keep moving.
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.260]  So you'd go like one step at a time and one person held you up.
[55:13.600 --> 55:17.040]  James was so strong that he could just carry the person the whole way.
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.100]  So like somebody would hop on the pole and then he'd lift it
[55:20.100 --> 55:23.120]  and he'd just walk across to the other side and they'd hop off
[55:23.120 --> 55:25.800]  as opposed to the other team having to do it properly.
[55:26.020 --> 55:28.500]  So they like never did that challenge again or they tweaked it.
[55:28.540 --> 55:32.120]  I think they changed it in some way because he just he broke it.
[55:32.220 --> 55:36.200]  They didn't expect anybody being so strong and they just finished it immediately.
[55:36.500 --> 55:38.000]  It's a great season. Yeah, it's fun to watch.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.720]  We're a reality TV show podcast.
[55:40.060 --> 55:42.400]  Oh, is that the new phase we are? We're a reality TV show.
[55:42.420 --> 55:43.720]  I guess we kind of always go with it.
[55:43.900 --> 55:45.240]  But yeah, well, we're above.
[55:45.500 --> 55:47.500]  I guess we're done with Bovril.
[55:47.720 --> 55:49.920]  Yeah. Unless Andrew wants to try a hot Bovril.
[55:50.340 --> 55:52.300]  I will try it next time. All right.
[55:52.460 --> 55:57.640]  We I feel like we extracted more joy out of Bovril than
[55:58.320 --> 55:59.500]  probably the collective
[56:00.780 --> 56:03.780]  population of Earth using it as actual sustenance.
[56:03.920 --> 56:05.460]  You might be right. Bovril should pay us.
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.160]  Yeah. Andrew, have you been in contact with Bovril?
[56:07.160 --> 56:09.140]  I have not been in contact with Bovril.
[56:09.300 --> 56:10.520]  Should I be in contact with Bovril?
[56:10.680 --> 56:11.700]  Well, maybe get something going.
[56:11.960 --> 56:14.540]  I don't know if what I've done with the Bovril product.
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.520]  Oh, my God. I just had a great idea.
[56:17.820 --> 56:19.420]  OK, I just had a great idea.
[56:19.820 --> 56:21.060]  Great idea. Think about this.
[56:21.220 --> 56:22.880]  A shirt that says Bovril drinker.
[56:23.020 --> 56:23.760]  No, no, no, no.
[56:23.760 --> 56:25.800]  We're not. I'm just not some shitty merchandise to sell people.
[56:26.260 --> 56:26.980]  Here's an idea.
[56:28.260 --> 56:29.260]  What did we used to be?
[56:29.260 --> 56:31.000]  We used to be an Apple podcast, right?
[56:31.500 --> 56:33.820]  For a time. And we flirt with apples occasionally.
[56:33.820 --> 56:36.880]  We're obviously we're medium Cosmic Crisp fans.
[56:37.500 --> 56:40.380]  What do people like to do in the fall with apples?
[56:40.920 --> 56:43.020]  Cider. They like to bob for apples.
[56:43.220 --> 56:45.860]  What if you have Bovril for apples?
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.400]  You get like a big drum.
[56:47.900 --> 56:48.780]  You fill it with you.
[56:48.900 --> 56:51.220]  You fill it with Bovril and you have to bob for apples.
[56:51.480 --> 56:54.680]  No. You have to put your arms behind your head and dunk your head into to Bovril
[56:54.680 --> 56:55.520]  and pull out an apple.
[56:55.880 --> 56:56.960]  Bobbing for apples.
[56:57.520 --> 56:58.540]  Bobbing for apples.
[56:59.280 --> 57:00.640]  That's an experience at RTX.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.680]  It doesn't matter that there's COVID or whatever.
[57:03.680 --> 57:06.900]  Everyone should be bobbing for apples in the same juice.
[57:07.440 --> 57:09.280]  I don't want to go to someone else's bob.
[57:09.480 --> 57:13.860]  We have got to at some point in our collective future bob for apples.
[57:14.140 --> 57:16.840]  Bovril might have some antiseptic properties that we don't know about.
[57:17.020 --> 57:19.340]  That's true. I would bob for apple.
[57:19.700 --> 57:22.920]  I think you and I could make a supplemental where we bob for apples.
[57:23.280 --> 57:23.920]  I think that's a great idea.
[57:24.060 --> 57:29.800]  You also speaking of supplementals, you also need to make a Gavin's
[57:29.800 --> 57:32.940]  Italian pizza at my in my my fucking backyard.
[57:32.940 --> 57:35.320]  Yeah, I've got to clear out the spiders and scorpions in that.
[57:35.480 --> 57:36.380]  Yeah, we can do that.
[57:37.180 --> 57:37.820]  Oh, man.
[57:44.610 --> 57:46.970]  OK, I got excited, brought up Cosmic Crisps.
[57:46.990 --> 57:49.090]  I have one. I'm going to wash away.
[57:49.190 --> 57:51.770]  Yeah, we all do. Everybody's got one in their fucking fridge right now, right?
[57:51.790 --> 57:52.670]  We're waiting a year to eat them.
[57:52.830 --> 57:55.450]  Well, yeah, I do. But I mean, like I've had one that I can eat now.
[57:55.570 --> 57:57.710]  I bought Cosmic Crisps over the weekend.
[57:57.930 --> 58:00.070]  I'll be honest, I forgot to put mine in the fridge.
[58:00.970 --> 58:03.370]  God damn it. I might just need half of yours, Geoff.
[58:03.770 --> 58:05.350]  Yeah, that's fine. You can have half of mine.
[58:05.470 --> 58:07.430]  I doubt I'll get through it one year from now.
[58:07.530 --> 58:09.110]  When are we supposed to do that?
[58:09.270 --> 58:11.950]  I wrote the date on my apple, so I'll have to.
[58:12.150 --> 58:15.390]  Yeah, well, fucking obviously I know what date.
[58:15.690 --> 58:18.010]  All right, hold up. Let me go check my let me go check my apple.
[58:18.090 --> 58:18.830]  And I'll tell you, I'll be right back.
[58:18.970 --> 58:20.630]  Andrew, when does the redemption year end?
[58:22.990 --> 58:24.350]  Well, year two, right?
[58:24.530 --> 58:26.310]  Did you just take a bite of an apple?
[58:26.990 --> 58:27.570]  Yeah, I did.
[58:27.790 --> 58:29.830]  Yeah, you didn't hear him, he's clearing his palate with a Cosmic Crisps.
[58:30.070 --> 58:32.070]  Well, I didn't think he was actually doing it.
[58:32.070 --> 58:33.330]  And then you asked him a question.
[58:33.430 --> 58:36.450]  And I heard the biggest like horse style chomp.
[58:36.610 --> 58:37.590]  I take horse bites.
[58:37.990 --> 58:39.810]  I love apples. What can I say?
[58:40.410 --> 58:42.610]  I'm trying to get the beef out of my mouth, Eric.
[58:42.810 --> 58:43.930]  It's so beefy in here.
[58:44.830 --> 58:47.370]  The beef is what lingered, not all the salad cream.
[58:47.830 --> 58:49.870]  What was the pop that you didn't have?
[58:50.090 --> 58:51.750]  Or yeah, what was the one popsicle? Coke.
[58:51.750 --> 58:52.890]  The Coca-Cola one. Oh, that's sad.
[58:52.990 --> 58:54.910]  But now you can enjoy that one, you know?
[58:55.190 --> 58:57.850]  I don't. I'm done with popsicles for a while.
[58:59.150 --> 59:00.510]  Oh, it ruined popsicle?
[59:00.510 --> 59:01.170]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[59:01.290 --> 59:03.290]  It absolutely ruined popsicles for a little bit.
[59:03.450 --> 59:05.290]  I got some good news and some bad news.
[59:05.370 --> 59:09.650]  Oh, no. December 9th, 2022 is the date we need to do it.
[59:09.770 --> 59:10.850]  Oh, that's...
[59:10.850 --> 59:14.730]  I picked out... I have a Ziploc bag with my apple in it.
[59:14.770 --> 59:18.390]  And that says in Sharpie, do not open until December 9th, 2022.
[59:19.090 --> 59:21.430]  However, when I picked that up out of the back of my fridge,
[59:21.610 --> 59:23.950]  the apple sort of collapsed in on itself.
[59:24.070 --> 59:27.690]  And it is a big, mushy, crab-apple-y looking mess.
[59:27.690 --> 59:32.310]  We are going to get very, very sick when we eat this.
[59:32.310 --> 59:32.650]  What happened?
[59:33.110 --> 59:35.790]  You try... Was it not clean when it went in?
[59:35.930 --> 59:37.170]  It was clean and sealed.
[59:37.370 --> 59:38.630]  Geoff has a fucked up fridge.
[59:38.810 --> 59:40.090]  I do have a fucked up fridge.
[59:40.230 --> 59:42.670]  We need to talk about the... Why do we trust him?
[59:42.890 --> 59:44.790]  What's your apple's condition, Andrew?
[59:45.070 --> 59:46.070]  My apple's condition?
[59:46.490 --> 59:48.170]  Let me... What's in the fridge downstairs?
[59:48.670 --> 59:49.870]  Oh, you don't like changing floors.
[59:50.070 --> 59:51.610]  Want me to go run and see?
[59:51.830 --> 59:52.890]  Yeah, why don't you run and see?
[59:53.090 --> 59:54.070]  I'll go check. I'll go check.
[59:54.250 --> 59:55.670]  It is so mushy.
[59:55.810 --> 59:57.570]  I like this because it's sort of the halfway point.
[59:57.570 --> 59:58.750]  Yeah, that doesn't bode well.
[59:59.010 --> 01:00:03.030]  Maybe when I get the new fridge in 17 years, I can put another one in and try it.
[01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.950]  Try it again.
[01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.710]  Oh, my God. It looks heinous.
[01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:09.290]  Did you place the order for a new fridge?
[01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:11.070]  Yeah, I talked about it on the podcast, didn't I?
[01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.730]  Yeah, I just don't remember if you pulled the trigger or not.
[01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:14.350]  Oh, I pulled the fucking trigger.
[01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.070]  That's why I had to get it next February.
[01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:19.470]  On the next... Yeah, just in time for episode 1000.
[01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.950]  Maybe we should have a bit of food that we keep for episode 1000.
[01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:26.630]  Like, do you have any food that you'd want to buy now and eat in 17 and a half years?
[01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.070]  Yeah, I'm sure I do.
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:30.090]  Like a tin of beans or something? Probably keep?
[01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:32.110]  What if we...
[01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:35.290]  Oh, what if we bury...
[01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:36.050]  What if we do a...
[01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.670]  What if we do like a 10 year bean hole?
[01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:41.970]  Maybe like a biohazard.
[01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.670]  Put signs on it.
[01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:45.810]  So I have a confession to make.
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:46.490]  Oh, God.
[01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.770]  I have some good news and I have some bad news.
[01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:54.990]  So, during the time in which...
[01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:58.570]  Remember how I said I had that stretch for like a month and a half
[01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:00.990]  where I really my I injured my ankle really badly?
[01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:02.470]  Yeah. You were in bed for like a month.
[01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:07.890]  Yeah. So one of those times during that stretch, I was really hungry.
[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:10.110]  I didn't feel like...
[01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:14.310]  And I didn't I didn't feel like I was both hungry and thirsty.
[01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.570]  And I thought...
[01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.350]  And I thought, I can't go get food.
[01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:21.670]  And I don't want to... Walking to the sink is difficult.
[01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:22.930]  Like, even that is painful.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.930]  I took the Cosmic Crisp that we're holding on for a year and I ate it.
[01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.570]  I ate it that evening under the plan of I will immediately buy another
[01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.250]  and then just replace it and it will be the same.
[01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:37.810]  You can't be trusted to do anything.
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:42.890]  I have not been able to find Cosmic Crisps until Sunday
[01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:44.430]  when I bought the Bovril.
[01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:49.630]  So the bag of Cosmic Crisps I have are for the next iteration
[01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:50.790]  of the one year wait.
[01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.870]  So even after Geoff's description of his apple, yours is in worse condition.
[01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:58.150]  Mine is. Yes, yes, it is.
[01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:58.990]  It is much worse.
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:01.610]  It is somewhere. It is long gone.
[01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.510]  So out of the three of us, I'm the only one who can follow fucking directions.
[01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.090]  Well, I followed the directions.
[01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.990]  I just got thirsty and it was very late.
[01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.730]  Well, and yours fell apart, Geoff. So we got nothing.
[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:16.990]  It's still in the bag and it's still it's just mushy.
[01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.410]  It's still an apple. We're still going to eat it.
[01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.870]  Yeah, we'll keep yours in and I'm throwing mine in.
[01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.410]  I'm throwing mine in right now.
[01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:29.530]  You two motherfuckers just hard, hard salad creamed our apple experiment.
[01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:30.530]  No, both of you.
[01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:33.850]  I think Andrew salad creamed it because he deliberately ate it.
[01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:34.870]  And what did you do?
[01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:37.170]  You didn't even start step one.
[01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:39.210]  I think you're much worse than I was.
[01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:40.910]  Originally on my desk at work.
[01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.690]  And then I was like, oh, I never put it in the fridge.
[01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:43.770]  Went to get it. It's gone.
[01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:46.270]  Did you take it? Did someone take it?
[01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.730]  No. I never put it in.
[01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.310]  I even stopped myself.
[01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:50.250]  I think I told the story.
[01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:53.490]  I stopped myself from superglue it to your desk because I was in the process of doing it.
[01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:56.510]  And then I thought, oh, he might need this and I don't want to ruin the cosmic crisp.
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:59.190]  So I treated it with respect, much like the competition.
[01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:01.650]  All right. Well, I can start at the same time as Andrew.
[01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:04.210]  Yeah, well, we'll have three different iterations.
[01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:08.610]  You got the one year apple and we'll have the whatever, seven months or whatever.
[01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:09.490]  Well, let's be fair.
[01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:11.150]  Geoff has to put it again anyway.
[01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.990]  No, we'll just eat what's left of what I mean.
[01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:16.190]  It might be apple soup by then, but we'll eat it.
[01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:17.250]  Nick has a good point.
[01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:19.430]  Salmon creaming involves an action.
[01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:21.590]  Gavin didn't get that far with the apple.
[01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.650]  I don't know. I don't pre cream.
[01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:25.750]  I don't want to talk pre cream right now.
[01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:28.050]  My stomach is in a it's in a bad way.
[01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:29.690]  Why is my doorbell ringing?
[01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.090]  Andrew, you didn't send me anything, did you?
[01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:33.410]  I didn't send you.
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:35.370]  Henry's pissed.
[01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:37.570]  Eric says that's the wrap up bell.
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:38.830]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:42.050]  And I think I should get credit for confessing to my crimes.
[01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:43.570]  Yeah, it was very honest of you.
[01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:47.550]  And I think you would have continued lying to us for the next eight months
[01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:48.490]  had we not brought it up.
[01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:51.470]  It was a very when you asked me to check the status of my apple,
[01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.130]  there was a little bit of a panic.
[01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:54.510]  I like that you went anyway.
[01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:58.170]  No, I leaned back in my chair and I just kept eating the apple I was eating.
[01:03:58.310 --> 01:03:59.910]  And then I almost choked on it.
[01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:01.670]  I almost started coughing from it.
[01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.050]  Was it in your bedroom fridge?
[01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:05.410]  It was. Yeah, it's in my bar.
[01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.050]  Because because when you said you were going to go downstairs and check,
[01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.490]  I was like, well, how did he get to it then?
[01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:10.590]  That was the thing. Yeah.
[01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:13.210]  No, it was that was all I left in there.
[01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:14.730]  But this one I will not touch.
[01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.710]  It's a promise. What if you wreck your ankle again?
[01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:20.510]  I will die. I will die of thirst before I touch that Cosmic Crisp.
[01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.330]  I like that you went for the apple for the for the liquid in it.
[01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.430]  That's why I went because they're so fucking juicy.
[01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:27.290]  I was thirsty.
[01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.190]  It was more thirsty than hungry.
[01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.050]  And I didn't I didn't have anything to drink.
[01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:35.590]  So we'll we'll do this experiment again and just hope that for the span of
[01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.150]  three hundred and sixty five days,
[01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:41.310]  Andrew doesn't get slightly inconvenienced or thirsty at any point.
[01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.330]  No, it was. Let's be fair.
[01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:44.550]  I was I couldn't walk.
[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.030]  I was in a let's be fair.
[01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:48.010]  That describes half of your year.
[01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:49.450]  No, this is a different thing.
[01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:51.110]  I was this is different.
[01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:54.490]  Do you you almost you almost ended up bedridden again
[01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.930]  because you got too excited to stand up to get in line last week?
[01:04:58.030 --> 01:04:59.250]  No, no, no, no, no, I didn't.
[01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:01.670]  I was fine. Like that was there's no that was just a tweet.
[01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:03.730]  This was a different that was a different thing.
[01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:05.190]  Eric wants the podcast to be over.
[01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:06.570]  There needs to be. Yeah, I agree.
[01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:11.910]  There needs to be some fucking ramifications for people going forward
[01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:15.030]  who salad cream this apple experiment.
[01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.130]  Accountability. Nick is right.
[01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:19.130]  I feel like I was very accountable.
[01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:21.370]  I would argue I was the most accountable here.
[01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:25.530]  You cost us five months of an experiment because you're thirsty for apples.
[01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:26.830]  What about what about this?
[01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:29.690]  I'll I'll put mine in now and I'll leave it to you.
[01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:31.270]  It's not supposed to be good for two years.
[01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:32.450]  It's only supposed to be good for a year.
[01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:33.430]  I'll leave it for a year.
[01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:34.930]  Sound like it's good for a year anyway.
[01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:38.090]  Yeah, not in my not in my whack ass fridge.
[01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:42.430]  I like you're coming at us for fucking experiment.
[01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:43.550]  No, it's coming to you.
[01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.130]  I got a fucking I got an apple in a fridge right now
[01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:50.070]  that's been there since December 9th of last year.
[01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:51.770]  So I can put it in any fridge.
[01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.090]  Do I need to plug the fridge and you have a broken fridge?
[01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.870]  There have been three different levels of effort and the result is the same
[01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.530]  for everyone. There's no apple to eat.
[01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.010]  No, I got an apple we're going to eat.
[01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.350]  We're just going to die eating it.
[01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:05.390]  You're going to eat a bag of mush.
[01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.650]  It's already it's already a collapse and exposes.
[01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.650]  We are going to eat a bag of mush.
[01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:12.950]  We you and I together.
[01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.310]  We already said so before.
[01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:15.050]  You know, it was gross.
[01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:16.530]  You've already agreed.
[01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.790]  Maybe you can put it in the next beanhole.
[01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:19.710]  It's like, I don't know.
[01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:20.970]  Do you like an apple dish?
[01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:22.050]  Maybe maybe we'll both.
[01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:23.150]  Now that's interesting.
[01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:24.330]  Bob for mush.
[01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:26.430]  Oh, man. Yeah.
[01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:27.930]  We throw it in with the bobbing for apple.
[01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:29.830]  And if you get that one, you lose in a lot of.
[01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:33.210]  Oh, all right.
[01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:35.170]  Well, yeah, I guess
[01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:38.670]  we'll talk to you next time, tell people or don't listen again,
[01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.430]  maybe buy some shit or don't whatever.
[01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:45.710]  I'm putting the same amount of effort into the outro that Andrew put into the.
[01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:48.790]  Well, I rather I should say the Gavin put into the apple contest.
[01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:50.630]  So see you next week.
[01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:53.710]  So we don't or who knows who gives a fuck here?
[01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:54.190]  I don't know.
[01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:55.870]  We'll be here probably.
[01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:57.150]  Maybe we won't.
[01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:58.030]  I don't know.
[01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:58.790]  I hope so.
[01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:01.210]  Tune in to find out or don't tune in to find out.
[01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:02.030]  We'll never know.
[01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:02.730]  Bye.
[01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:04.790]  Really playing with the medium there.
[01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:10.870]  Hey, guys.
[01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:13.990]  Regular fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:17.590]  Do you know Geoff co-stars in another podcast about theme parks?
[01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:21.690]  Gavin tells everyone about his favorite podcast called Annual Pass.
[01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.850]  Penn talks about how roller coasters are better than bagels.
[01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:26.670]  Geoff discovers G forces.
[01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:30.710]  The boys decide that Annual Pass is a much better podcast to listen to
[01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:33.670]  than face. Annual Pass releases every Thursday,
[01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:35.350]  anywhere you get your podcasts.
[01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:37.970]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:41.150]  All that and more on next week's episode of Annual Pass.
