[00:15.120 --> 00:17.680]  I think the Dictionary Kid might be a young owl.
[00:18.380 --> 00:20.880]  Yeah, oh, I was thinking like an open book.
[00:21.300 --> 00:27.420]  I also, I don't want it to be an owl because something about Dictionary Kid is very stab-able on the topic of my mind.
[00:27.720 --> 00:29.860]  It's a very stab-able persona.
[00:30.220 --> 00:32.760]  Nobody wants to stab the Dictionary Kid.
[00:33.240 --> 00:39.040]  No, well, you know, remember in Tomorrow Never Dies? Is that the Bond movie with the last...
[00:39.040 --> 00:41.220]  He'll know. This fucking guy will know.
[00:41.220 --> 00:43.960]  Gavin, what was the last Bond movie with Brosnan?
[00:44.460 --> 00:45.280]  Tomorrow Never Dies?
[00:45.520 --> 00:46.080]  Die Another Day.
[00:46.500 --> 00:47.260]  Die Another Day.
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.220]  She fucking goes to stab the lady and she's got a Bible in her jacket and it stabs the Bible
[00:53.220 --> 00:57.040]  and then she puts the Bible and she kicks the Bible into the villain.
[00:57.560 --> 01:01.500]  So what you're saying is the Dictionary Kid has natural immunity to stabbing.
[01:01.900 --> 01:03.340]  I think so, yeah, based on...
[01:03.800 --> 01:05.020]  You're talking about getting stabbed?
[01:05.580 --> 01:07.760]  Well, it's a whole thing with knives.
[01:08.700 --> 01:12.140]  Does Eric still do his Previously On for us to listen to?
[01:12.760 --> 01:15.200]  I forgot to record. I'm gonna record.
[01:15.580 --> 01:16.560]  Eric, what happened last time?
[01:16.680 --> 01:17.520]  You weren't recording?
[01:17.860 --> 01:18.420]  I am now.
[01:18.880 --> 01:23.600]  The last episode was 108. I wasn't here, so I'm going off of Nick's notes.
[01:25.020 --> 01:25.840]  Oh, there are a lot of them.
[01:26.360 --> 01:26.540]  Yeah.
[01:26.540 --> 01:27.100]  You went long.
[01:27.960 --> 01:32.460]  Wow, wow, what a shock. I can't believe that. No way.
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.440]  Talked about Geoff listening to episode 107, talked about Clip Paranoia, talked about the Tuxedo Tuxedo,
[01:38.960 --> 01:43.520]  Fuckstick Grown Tubes, Meow Wolf Spelling Bees, and what you actually call a group of podcasters.
[01:44.180 --> 01:46.640]  This is episode 109. Take it away.
[01:46.900 --> 01:52.520]  We've got Eric telling us what happened last week when he has no idea, and Jack telling us what happened next week.
[01:52.660 --> 01:56.200]  Didn't we bleep that one thing that he said?
[01:56.560 --> 01:57.400]  I don't know.
[01:58.220 --> 01:59.200]  The Tuxedo thing?
[01:59.500 --> 02:00.600]  Yeah, didn't we bleep the Tuxedo?
[02:01.740 --> 02:02.700]  Yeah, we did.
[02:02.700 --> 02:03.680]  We bleeped it originally.
[02:04.100 --> 02:05.180]  Because we wanted to do it.
[02:05.540 --> 02:07.780]  But then in last week's episode, we talk about it.
[02:08.280 --> 02:10.500]  Do we have any update on the Tuxedo?
[02:10.700 --> 02:11.400]  Do we have a Tuxedo?
[02:11.680 --> 02:11.780]  Are we getting the Tuxedo?
[02:13.380 --> 02:15.500]  We can get a Tuxedo, but the Tuxedo.
[02:15.820 --> 02:17.520]  No, I don't have any update right now.
[02:17.600 --> 02:18.920]  When is that for auction?
[02:19.560 --> 02:20.940]  Like five days from now.
[02:21.420 --> 02:22.460]  Oh, we better get on it.
[02:22.460 --> 02:26.280]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:26.500 --> 02:27.340]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[02:27.700 --> 02:29.680]  With me as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton.
[02:30.640 --> 02:33.580]  On the ones and the zeros, Nick and Eric.
[02:35.960 --> 02:42.200]  This is episode 109 of Season 4, Year 3, Volume 1.
[02:42.780 --> 02:44.740]  Gavin, I already asked the other two, but let me ask you.
[02:44.980 --> 02:47.860]  Does my voice sound at all different or weird to you?
[02:48.660 --> 02:49.920]  Maybe a bit more nasal.
[02:49.920 --> 02:52.220]  Ah, f***, I knew it. Okay, hold on a second.
[02:52.780 --> 02:57.520]  Andrew, if it happens five days from now, that means the next episode hasn't come out yet.
[02:57.820 --> 03:01.460]  I mean, that means it's out, and that means people will be able to snipe us for it.
[03:01.620 --> 03:05.200]  I don't... maybe my math is wrong. I'll have to look. It's soon.
[03:06.000 --> 03:06.600]  It's important.
[03:07.760 --> 03:09.180]  I've been pushing this for weeks.
[03:09.720 --> 03:12.480]  I would argue that I'm the one that has held this with the most importance.
[03:12.500 --> 03:16.580]  But you did a whole spiel last week about how it already would have happened and blah blah blah.
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.380]  Well, it's possible that I did the math wrong in the moment.
[03:19.380 --> 03:23.100]  That's very possible. And if so, please don't snipe us.
[03:23.220 --> 03:25.800]  But this had already come out after... it doesn't... it's pointless.
[03:26.020 --> 03:27.360]  What is even the point of this conversation?
[03:27.640 --> 03:28.940]  There's no correcting here.
[03:29.320 --> 03:33.600]  Look, telling them to do something in this episode is pointless, but you talked...
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.560]  Like, it's up to us now whether to cut it from the last one as well.
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.760]  Can a man not make a mistake, Gavin? I made a mistake.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.560]  I'm saying it's not too late. It's not too late.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.580]  What do you mean?
[03:44.600 --> 03:46.900]  I don't understand what's happening right now.
[03:46.900 --> 03:51.120]  I thought you were mad at me because I'm allowing them to snipe us, but we're still not even on the field.
[03:51.500 --> 03:53.740]  We don't even know if we have a clearance to land.
[03:54.180 --> 03:56.740]  They can't snipe what's not there. We might not be there.
[03:57.100 --> 04:00.740]  You utter fool. I'm saying it's still in our hands. You haven't dropped the ball yet.
[04:01.040 --> 04:03.120]  You're still in the process of dropping it.
[04:03.300 --> 04:04.520]  What are we talking about?
[04:04.660 --> 04:08.200]  I feel like Eric brings up a good point. We are a time travel podcast.
[04:08.640 --> 04:09.640]  So, uh...
[04:10.160 --> 04:11.440]  Andrew, what don't you understand?
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.900]  I thought you were saying that I said it if it's five days from now, the episode...
[04:16.360 --> 04:18.800]  Oh, no, never mind. I worked it out. We're good.
[04:20.520 --> 04:21.260]  When's the auction?
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.300]  Five days from now, I think. Maybe.
[04:23.460 --> 04:25.300]  That's when the episode comes out, though.
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.680]  Yeah, but it's 8am. The auction's at 8am. There's no way the amount of people that'll listen at 8am...
[04:30.680 --> 04:31.580]  Is that a Wednesday or Tuesday?
[04:31.600 --> 04:33.180]  The podcast comes out at 3am.
[04:33.640 --> 04:36.760]  Technically, what day is five days from now?
[04:39.160 --> 04:40.940]  Where did you get 8am?
[04:41.440 --> 04:46.760]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. I think it might be Tuesday.
[04:47.360 --> 04:51.520]  That's limited. Only first people can listen at that point.
[04:51.740 --> 04:53.780]  You mean the most devoted fans?
[04:54.620 --> 04:56.600]  You know, that's one way to phrase it.
[04:56.740 --> 05:00.180]  The most rabid of comment leavers and regulation listeners?
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.500]  I think we'll be okay. My point is, honestly, we don't even have a clearance to land.
[05:04.500 --> 05:06.960]  I'm not worried about getting sniped if we're not on the battlefield.
[05:07.200 --> 05:09.760]  We need to be able to be on the battlefield. That's my concern.
[05:10.240 --> 05:11.620]  Well, this has already happened at this point.
[05:11.780 --> 05:16.160]  What you're talking about is, we're going to try and bid on the tuxedo from the tuxedo,
[05:16.700 --> 05:23.500]  but the auction is the same day an episode comes out where you talk about getting the tuxedo from the tuxedo.
[05:23.740 --> 05:26.840]  So we could be in a massive bidding war with regulation listeners.
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.140]  We could be, but we don't even have a clearance to land yet.
[05:30.260 --> 05:31.700]  So I think we need to relax on that.
[05:32.220 --> 05:33.180]  Can we do it?
[05:33.180 --> 05:37.340]  I don't know what part... I don't know what you think changed in the last three minutes.
[05:38.980 --> 05:40.340]  Oh, did you already say we couldn't do it?
[05:40.360 --> 05:46.260]  What do you think? Just out of curiosity, what do you think happened from the last time I was asked, can we do this?
[05:46.520 --> 05:50.120]  Do you think it's right now, five days from now? Or what do you think happened?
[05:50.920 --> 05:53.660]  Are we truly a time travel podcast? What's going on?
[05:53.940 --> 05:56.080]  I didn't hear your response three minutes ago. What was it?
[05:58.040 --> 06:00.080]  I'm trying to get it.
[06:00.080 --> 06:00.800]  We're trying.
[06:03.180 --> 06:05.840]  He's got five days to get it. Give him some slack.
[06:06.180 --> 06:10.260]  Yeah, but we still need to decide whether we cut it. Forget it.
[06:10.340 --> 06:11.300]  No, no.
[06:11.380 --> 06:16.240]  Let me know. Ask me again in 15 minutes to see if anything changed from three minutes ago.
[06:16.360 --> 06:16.980]  You got it, man.
[06:17.280 --> 06:18.160]  That's a great point.
[06:18.380 --> 06:22.260]  Gav, I think you're right. We do have to make the decision, but we have some time to play with it.
[06:22.320 --> 06:25.080]  We have another, what, 45 minutes of this podcast?
[06:25.340 --> 06:28.320]  Let's punt it so that future us can deal with it.
[06:28.660 --> 06:31.340]  Current us, take a load off. Let's not bother with it anymore.
[06:31.340 --> 06:34.080]  All right, let's chill out. Episode one and nine, what are we talking about?
[06:34.460 --> 06:36.240]  Uh, well, I think we're talking about the tuxedo.
[06:39.080 --> 06:44.080]  We're talking about knives. I asked, is every knife serrated? I didn't know what serrated means before you joined.
[06:44.200 --> 06:47.040]  I was learning about that because I hear like a serrated edge.
[06:47.700 --> 06:50.620]  Do you feel like there's too many words to describe an edge?
[06:51.180 --> 06:52.820]  Uh, well, what other words do we have?
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.800]  I don't know, I feel like serrated, corrugated, it's all just like wibbly metal.
[06:57.800 --> 06:58.660]  What's a corrugated?
[06:58.660 --> 07:01.240]  Well, corrugated is like... what?
[07:01.700 --> 07:03.000]  What is a corrugated edge?
[07:04.160 --> 07:08.080]  Well, it's not really an edge, but it's more of just like how metal is, or how like cardboard is, isn't it?
[07:08.160 --> 07:10.560]  It's like a bubbly up and down edge.
[07:11.460 --> 07:14.180]  What? I love that you...
[07:14.640 --> 07:19.420]  Your whole thesis was, do you think there are too many ways to describe an edge?
[07:19.580 --> 07:23.900]  And then you listed serrated as something that's never associated with an edge.
[07:24.320 --> 07:26.980]  Yeah, I guess corrugated is always the entire thing through.
[07:26.980 --> 07:28.480]  You wouldn't ever just corrugate an edge.
[07:28.800 --> 07:29.200]  Yeah.
[07:29.840 --> 07:32.080]  Yeah, you know what? I'm fine with the amount of words we've got.
[07:32.300 --> 07:40.080]  I mean, you've got dull, you've got serrated, you've got jagged, you've got sharp, uh, rusty, and that's about it.
[07:43.040 --> 07:43.840]  Bad play.
[07:44.660 --> 07:46.760]  Rusty is like an effect on the whole thing.
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.520]  I guess it could be a rusty edge, I feel like that's a thing I've heard.
[07:49.800 --> 07:54.600]  Sounds like a wrestling move, like the rusty edge. The top rope, hit him with the rusty edge.
[07:54.600 --> 07:56.740]  Rusty edge sounds like a wrestler.
[07:57.360 --> 08:04.080]  Yeah? Is an edge just, like, out of work edge? Is that his alter ego, rusty edge?
[08:04.340 --> 08:04.580]  Yeah.
[08:05.020 --> 08:07.080]  I read the funniest comment on the last podcast.
[08:07.900 --> 08:11.520]  From, uh, Anya888 said,
[08:11.640 --> 08:16.520]  Comment leaver here, just wanted to say this is probably my most paused podcast due to needing to laugh, thank you.
[08:16.660 --> 08:21.940]  Also, on another note, is there a program for re-becoming a regulation listener?
[08:21.940 --> 08:24.100]  Like, born-again regulation listener.
[08:24.300 --> 08:28.960]  I like the idea of a comment leaver wanting to somehow scrub the fact that they've left a comment.
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.040]  And whether there's an official program to re-enter regulation listener.
[08:34.540 --> 08:40.860]  I think it's so interesting that comment leaver has such a negative association with it, when it's not at all a negative thing.
[08:45.280 --> 08:52.680]  Apparently, especially considering now that just a fucking human-to-human conversation is a comment, apparently.
[08:53.200 --> 08:58.660]  So it's like, every interaction you've had with another human being in your entire life makes you a comment leaver.
[08:58.780 --> 09:01.100]  So I don't know why people would be so freaked out about being comment leavers.
[09:01.280 --> 09:02.580]  I can't stand my fucking voice.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.840]  No, it's different, though. Eric had a point.
[09:04.980 --> 09:07.920]  It is weird to just go out of your way and leave a comment on other content.
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.660]  But, you know, I'm saying that from being one. So, I think it's fine. I turned out alright.
[09:13.380 --> 09:17.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know variety of edges? I think you turned out great.
[09:17.740 --> 09:19.160]  You know all the words for edges.
[09:19.800 --> 09:24.080]  I don't think he does. I think he knew one word for edge, and then he knew corrugated metal.
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.480]  I think he was the worst in that regard.
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.260]  What my favorite part about that is, is I had no idea what corrugated mean, and he revealed that it wasn't an edge.
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.380]  He could have just kept it going. Like, the fact that I would have never challenged him.
[09:35.420 --> 09:37.360]  You could have told me anything. I'd have no idea.
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.160]  I could have lied to you about edges.
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.500]  Oh, you could have absolutely lied.
[09:40.800 --> 09:42.580]  You still don't know what corrugated is, do you?
[09:43.400 --> 09:45.720]  No, I have no clue. Not even the slightest idea.
[09:45.740 --> 09:47.220]  I'll send you a picture of corrugated metal, and you'll see.
[09:47.720 --> 09:50.940]  I told such a great lie yesterday that makes me so happy.
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.160]  We're talking about Thanksgiving, and Canada has a different Thanksgiving than America.
[09:57.300 --> 09:59.000]  It's in October, as opposed to November.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.840]  And they asked, like, are there any traditional Canadian norms?
[10:04.280 --> 10:10.440]  And I just said that we have goose instead of turkey every year, and instead of mashed potatoes, it's like yam mashed potatoes.
[10:10.740 --> 10:15.100]  And they were all in on this. They're convinced that Canada people eat goose every year.
[10:16.200 --> 10:19.500]  Makes me happy that that's just what they're going to think until they're challenged by it.
[10:20.040 --> 10:20.840]  Can you eat moose?
[10:21.120 --> 10:23.960]  I feel like that would be a really tough meat to eat.
[10:24.300 --> 10:26.700]  Oh, there you go, Andrew. Just posted something.
[10:27.820 --> 10:29.740]  That's corrugated metal. That's corrugated.
[10:30.520 --> 10:30.880]  Okay.
[10:31.280 --> 10:32.020]  It's got waves.
[10:32.280 --> 10:34.580]  Got it. So if it has waves, it's corrugated.
[10:34.920 --> 10:35.160]  Yeah.
[10:35.460 --> 10:35.820]  Awesome.
[10:36.020 --> 10:39.280]  I just read what Eric wrote above that. Is that a recent comment? When did he write that?
[10:39.380 --> 10:40.020]  He just wrote it.
[10:40.320 --> 10:41.000]  I wrote it just now.
[10:41.460 --> 10:43.080]  Eric has a tuxedo update. Go ahead.
[10:43.800 --> 10:44.520]  We have approval.
[10:44.880 --> 10:45.240]  Yeah!
[10:46.700 --> 10:47.840]  We need to make it a guilt!
[10:47.840 --> 10:55.840]  There are caveats and details that we can get into later, but we are approved for...
[10:56.860 --> 10:58.020]  What's our credit limit?
[10:58.840 --> 11:00.340]  That's what we gotta get into.
[11:00.660 --> 11:05.220]  Andrew said that it takes six days to get approved on the website, so we need to get going on that.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.680]  I assume, Eric, you...
[11:06.680 --> 11:07.160]  Go for it.
[11:07.280 --> 11:09.040]  With the credit card and ability...
[11:09.040 --> 11:11.120]  And what is the estimated price?
[11:11.400 --> 11:12.640]  I believe it was $2,000.
[11:12.860 --> 11:14.560]  They estimate it going for $2,000.
[11:14.860 --> 11:15.640]  $2,000 to $3,000.
[11:15.640 --> 11:18.180]  I feel like a lot of the time they massively underestimate.
[11:19.060 --> 11:28.220]  Well, I think it depends on the thing, because I was doing some research, I was looking at other things, and they had like a Zoolander 2 auction, and so many of the items didn't have a bid on them.
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.220]  Like, only a handful did.
[11:29.540 --> 11:32.600]  I don't think the tuxedo from the tuxedo is going to be that high demand.
[11:32.700 --> 11:36.540]  Well, there's also the buyer's premium, which is like a percentage on top of the final sale.
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.760]  So you gotta remember about that.
[11:37.840 --> 11:38.600]  Dude, shut up.
[11:38.740 --> 11:39.540]  Shut up about that stuff.
[11:39.540 --> 11:47.580]  The only people that are going to be buying a tuxedo from the tuxedo are f*** face regulation listeners or comment leavers.
[11:48.080 --> 11:48.520]  I'm convinced.
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.820]  I don't think there's enough of a large tuxedo tuxedo following out there.
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.940]  Maybe somebody who wants to backdoor into a Versace suit, and this is how they're going to do it.
[11:58.020 --> 12:03.600]  But that's... I can't imagine people are lining up to get their hands on it.
[12:04.500 --> 12:06.780]  I bet comment leavers will get it.
[12:07.060 --> 12:09.240]  It does none of the stuff it pretends to do in the movie.
[12:09.240 --> 12:10.040]  I guarantee you.
[12:10.460 --> 12:11.180]  Oh, definitely not.
[12:11.320 --> 12:13.500]  And it has giant holes in the back for a harness.
[12:13.740 --> 12:14.200]  It's great.
[12:15.200 --> 12:17.180]  I don't think a caveat has ever been fun.
[12:17.660 --> 12:20.040]  Nobody's been, and there's a caveat, free pizza.
[12:20.280 --> 12:22.180]  Like it's always... it's terrible.
[12:22.620 --> 12:24.140]  You never want to hear that there's a caveat.
[12:24.740 --> 12:27.080]  You want like a positive caveat?
[12:27.380 --> 12:28.620]  I want like a little twist.
[12:28.700 --> 12:32.420]  Yeah, caveat could just be like a little positive twist, but it's never used that way.
[12:33.060 --> 12:33.240]  Hmm.
[12:33.460 --> 12:34.540]  There's one exception.
[12:35.100 --> 12:36.280]  All of the drinks are free.
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.300]  One little caveat.
[12:37.560 --> 12:38.520]  One unexpected twist.
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.700]  Talking about like serrated and learning things.
[12:41.780 --> 12:44.920]  I had a thought yesterday, and I don't know how this works.
[12:45.500 --> 12:46.600]  You don't know how thoughts work?
[12:47.100 --> 12:48.200]  Well, I know how thoughts work.
[12:48.280 --> 12:48.980]  I have plenty of those.
[12:50.580 --> 12:51.100]  Glasses.
[12:51.700 --> 13:00.900]  I never... I had an association of that glasses people wear and drink glasses, I assume, are made of glass.
[13:00.960 --> 13:04.120]  Of the same glass with some differences, I would also assume.
[13:04.940 --> 13:07.580]  Could you have prescription drink glasses?
[13:08.260 --> 13:13.780]  Could you have the prescription of your glasses be drinkable glasses?
[13:14.240 --> 13:14.340]  Yes.
[13:14.420 --> 13:15.200]  Is that possible?
[13:15.620 --> 13:15.840]  Yes.
[13:16.240 --> 13:18.100]  Yeah? That's a thing that could exist?
[13:18.580 --> 13:19.980]  I can't imagine why not.
[13:20.160 --> 13:21.280]  I don't understand the question.
[13:21.800 --> 13:28.120]  Well, because you have glasses you wear, and then people are like, give me... I need a glass for a drink.
[13:28.420 --> 13:31.480]  So you're saying a wearable pair of glasses that are like shot glasses?
[13:31.980 --> 13:35.460]  No, just like glasses that match your prescription.
[13:35.460 --> 13:39.540]  If you look through the glass, it's the same prescription as what you wear.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.600]  Yeah, that makes total sense to me.
[13:41.780 --> 13:44.340]  Yeah, but from how close? Doesn't it depend on the distance from your eye?
[13:44.820 --> 13:45.240]  Does it?
[13:45.880 --> 13:46.560]  I don't know.
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.980]  I also don't know. I'm asking these questions.
[13:49.080 --> 13:50.180]  Does anybody wear glasses?
[13:51.140 --> 13:53.600]  I'm supposed to, but I just choose not to.
[13:53.980 --> 13:54.860]  We've talked about this.
[13:55.260 --> 13:55.620]  Eric does.
[13:55.620 --> 13:56.080]  I do, Eric.
[13:56.940 --> 13:59.360]  Does it matter how close to your eyes the glasses are?
[13:59.360 --> 14:08.940]  Well, yeah, because the lenses are a little bit rounded, and they sit on your face a certain way.
[14:10.320 --> 14:11.200]  So, yeah.
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.080]  Yeah, like if you ever look through a magnifying glass, and then you pull it away from you, and it sort of inverts and goes the other way.
[14:17.340 --> 14:21.960]  Okay, so what if the glass, the cup, or the glass... well, it's not a cup.
[14:22.260 --> 14:25.420]  I would never touch a glass, but for the purposes of this.
[14:25.860 --> 14:33.840]  You take the glass, it's just like a normal pint glass, but on the inside, on the bottom, where you would set it down on the ground, it's concave a little bit.
[14:34.240 --> 14:35.980]  So you can like put it up to your eye.
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.020]  You just put it approximately to where your eye would be, and it functions as glasses.
[14:40.180 --> 14:41.640]  I think that could 100% exist.
[14:41.640 --> 14:44.320]  So you're looking in the underneath of it, not down it.
[14:44.900 --> 14:46.640]  Or, yeah, or through the side maybe even.
[14:46.660 --> 14:48.840]  Yeah, the side or the bottom is what I was thinking.
[14:49.260 --> 14:49.880]  The side.
[14:50.740 --> 14:53.820]  Yeah, because that could be useful for like reading a menu.
[14:53.840 --> 14:56.140]  You know, like you could be like, oh, I don't need glasses.
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.860]  I'm just going to hold mine to take a sip and look at the... and they might not even know.
[15:01.200 --> 15:03.100]  I need just enough of this Dr. Pepper.
[15:03.740 --> 15:14.580]  I have absolutely dreadful long-distance vision, but I just never wear glasses because I feel like I'm only inconveniencing myself.
[15:14.760 --> 15:18.660]  And the inconvenience of wearing glasses, it's annoying.
[15:18.660 --> 15:20.400]  It's annoying for how my nose is.
[15:20.560 --> 15:23.240]  My unbreakable nose does not hold glass as well.
[15:23.660 --> 15:26.820]  So I just go glassless, and I can't see anything at a distance.
[15:27.100 --> 15:32.420]  But up close, if I was a nearsighted person, I think that's the term for it.
[15:32.620 --> 15:34.000]  And you can't see, or is it...
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.460]  I feel like shot glasses are the way to go there.
[15:37.540 --> 15:40.860]  Because you could actually wear them as a pair of glasses on the front of your face.
[15:41.420 --> 15:44.260]  And I just Googled it, and I can't see that anyone's invented that yet.
[15:44.800 --> 15:46.160]  I don't... but why would you want that?
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.400]  You could take them off your face and do shots if you wanted.
[15:49.960 --> 15:53.820]  But then you could get alcohol in your eye. That seems like a bad idea.
[15:54.100 --> 15:55.060]  Like the traces of it.
[15:55.940 --> 15:57.080]  No, it'd be on the other side.
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.420]  It'd be on the other side. And also, alcohol is sterile, right? It'd just clean your eyes.
[16:01.760 --> 16:03.500]  Oh, it's the other way. Okay.
[16:03.900 --> 16:04.680]  Now I'm on board.
[16:05.380 --> 16:07.020]  The only problem is if it rains.
[16:07.520 --> 16:08.460]  You're gonna have a real issue.
[16:12.560 --> 16:13.380]  Yeah, just like that.
[16:13.380 --> 16:16.820]  That's the problem on a rainy day. You need to always have an umbrella with you at all times.
[16:17.020 --> 16:17.960]  You can't risk that.
[16:22.300 --> 16:23.920]  What's that in the sky? I can't look.
[16:24.300 --> 16:26.740]  I wore my wrong glasses today.
[16:27.380 --> 16:28.200]  Can't risk it.
[16:28.520 --> 16:30.480]  I wore my shot glasses today. I can't look up.
[16:31.460 --> 16:34.980]  I got a little smudge on my glass. I just need to look up for a moment.
[16:35.080 --> 16:36.040]  Hopefully there's a drizzle.
[16:36.380 --> 16:37.400]  I'd love to clean these.
[16:37.720 --> 16:38.580]  Oh, man.
[16:39.600 --> 16:40.900]  The sky is your dishwasher.
[16:44.920 --> 16:46.820]  Oh, I hope somebody makes those.
[16:48.740 --> 16:51.680]  That would have been a good uniform if we were in a pitching phase.
[16:51.840 --> 16:53.860]  Oh, yeah. We could hold on to that.
[16:54.140 --> 17:01.240]  By the way, that's being copywritten right now. TM registered and we're filing for the patent for it right now over a uniform.
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.900]  Don't worry about it. Don't get your grubby little hands on it outside of uniform industries. We're taking care of it.
[17:07.720 --> 17:14.400]  Speaking of stuff I wanted to make that we're probably not going to make, I thought it would be really funny to make a Vibe inspector shirt.
[17:15.180 --> 17:20.540]  But everybody reminded me pretty quickly that it just sounds like one of those spring break female body inspector shirts.
[17:20.820 --> 17:21.980]  So I guess we're not going to do it.
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.480]  Did we talk about that last time?
[17:24.000 --> 17:24.640]  I think we did.
[17:25.320 --> 17:26.260]  Well, we'll just cut this then.
[17:28.040 --> 17:29.200]  No, you can't cut it.
[17:29.380 --> 17:30.060]  I didn't remember that.
[17:30.660 --> 17:31.780]  No, you gotta keep it in.
[17:32.760 --> 17:35.420]  That's not your fault, Geoff. That's Eric's fault. He didn't recap enough.
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.780]  Yeah, I wasn't going to recap.
[17:37.660 --> 17:40.700]  Hey, Geoff, I'm so sorry.
[17:41.000 --> 17:41.660]  Hey, man, that's okay.
[17:43.480 --> 17:44.660]  Let's not make the shirt, though.
[17:47.920 --> 17:50.680]  The Vibe inspector was in reference to a house, right?
[17:50.920 --> 17:52.040]  Like a home inspector, yeah.
[17:52.380 --> 17:57.540]  I feel like maybe that's just like a culture journalist at that point. Are they Vibe inspectors?
[17:57.600 --> 17:59.800]  I feel like you could go beyond just houses.
[17:59.800 --> 18:01.240]  You could do music and movies.
[18:01.700 --> 18:04.220]  Well, one would assume you'd be able to branch out.
[18:04.520 --> 18:06.040]  Like a sommelier of vibes.
[18:06.560 --> 18:07.700]  For all sorts of scenarios.
[18:08.040 --> 18:09.120]  A Vibe sommelier.
[18:09.560 --> 18:10.720]  A Vibe sommelier.
[18:11.160 --> 18:11.400]  Yeah.
[18:12.180 --> 18:16.100]  Because sometimes you might have a movie,
[18:16.880 --> 18:18.500]  a get-together of friends,
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.000]  and somebody picks a bad movie
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.480]  and just throws the whole vibe off.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.300]  It's important to have a Vibe sommelier.
[18:24.940 --> 18:25.460]  In certain positions.
[18:26.900 --> 18:27.820]  I didn't see...
[18:27.820 --> 18:29.120]  Talking about great Vibe movies,
[18:29.280 --> 18:31.120]  I watched The Long Kiss Goodnight
[18:31.120 --> 18:32.980]  two days ago. Finally.
[18:33.900 --> 18:35.600]  One of my favorite directors, Rennie Harlan.
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.260]  What a fucking...
[18:37.260 --> 18:38.260]  What a vibe.
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.100]  Didn't we talk about that recently, too?
[18:40.240 --> 18:40.460]  Yeah.
[18:42.240 --> 18:44.600]  He's my favorite bad director.
[18:44.820 --> 18:46.820]  It's the Geena Davis, Sam Jackson movie, right?
[18:46.980 --> 18:47.300]  Yeah.
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.320]  Larry King is in it at the end.
[18:51.420 --> 18:52.580]  That was like an all-time...
[18:52.580 --> 18:54.020]  Every time I was clapping at the screen,
[18:54.320 --> 18:56.580]  it's a great surprise. You never expect Larry King
[18:57.200 --> 18:58.460]  in the final act.
[18:59.720 --> 19:00.140]  There's...
[19:00.140 --> 19:02.320]  I think the quiet best moment of the movie
[19:02.320 --> 19:04.140]  is somebody tries to kill
[19:04.140 --> 19:06.060]  the main character in her home
[19:06.060 --> 19:08.180]  and she's got this seven-year-old daughter
[19:08.180 --> 19:09.940]  and he shoots an RPG
[19:10.580 --> 19:11.840]  at her and he misses
[19:11.840 --> 19:14.060]  and it blows a hole at the end of their house
[19:14.440 --> 19:16.260]  and Geena Davis, the main character,
[19:16.620 --> 19:18.280]  fucking grabs her daughter
[19:18.280 --> 19:20.000]  like she's a sack
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.100]  and throws her out of the house
[19:22.100 --> 19:23.020]  to just avoid combat.
[19:23.340 --> 19:25.640]  She throws her as far as...
[19:25.640 --> 19:27.440]  It's like a 60-yard throw.
[19:27.600 --> 19:29.360]  It's like a Hail Mary bomb
[19:29.360 --> 19:31.920]  and this kid just goes flying out the house
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.640]  and you don't see her again until
[19:33.640 --> 19:35.060]  40 minutes into the movie.
[19:35.340 --> 19:37.440]  She's totally fine. She just vanishes.
[19:37.620 --> 19:39.620]  It's like she got thrown to a different state
[19:39.620 --> 19:40.520]  and she had to walk out.
[19:40.520 --> 19:43.420]  I like the idea of throwing someone later into the movie.
[19:44.860 --> 19:46.200]  She was at 20 minutes
[19:46.200 --> 19:47.640]  and threw her into 40 minutes.
[19:50.040 --> 19:51.520]  It's a terrible good movie.
[19:51.660 --> 19:54.080]  It's so bad. It's just wonderful.
[19:54.380 --> 19:55.200]  Another hit.
[19:56.600 --> 19:58.200]  They do some weird things.
[19:58.700 --> 20:00.400]  I think I haven't seen it since I saw it in the theater
[20:00.400 --> 20:01.960]  but I remember really enjoying it.
[20:02.280 --> 20:04.080]  Wasn't there some ice scene
[20:04.080 --> 20:05.080]  or ice skating or something?
[20:06.140 --> 20:08.180]  Yeah, there is. She goes skating
[20:08.180 --> 20:09.380]  with her daughter and
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.900]  they do this really weird thing. So she's like
[20:11.900 --> 20:14.000]  a secret agent and then she gets amnesia
[20:14.640 --> 20:16.160]  but for a while they pretend
[20:16.160 --> 20:17.660]  that she has split personalities
[20:17.660 --> 20:20.020]  and that the agent is an alternate personality
[20:20.020 --> 20:21.240]  to what she currently has
[20:21.240 --> 20:23.700]  and she can't remember what
[20:23.700 --> 20:25.800]  happens when she goes back into agent mode
[20:25.800 --> 20:27.560]  and so they're skating
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.580]  with her daughter and she
[20:29.580 --> 20:31.620]  falls over and the daughter
[20:31.620 --> 20:33.620]  is like, I'm scared and then she goes into
[20:33.620 --> 20:35.660]  agent mode and is like, listen you shit
[20:35.660 --> 20:37.620]  you're gonna fucking get up and you're never
[20:37.620 --> 20:39.780]  gonna fall again. You worthless
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.320]  sack of just
[20:41.320 --> 20:44.120]  human child uselessness.
[20:44.600 --> 20:45.740]  And then she's like, I don't
[20:45.740 --> 20:47.980]  even know what I said. Like she's in a treehouse
[20:47.980 --> 20:49.660]  later and she comes back and the daughter
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.040]  breaks her wrist. She's like a 90's winter soldier.
[20:51.700 --> 20:53.700]  She was! Yeah, it's a great example.
[20:54.520 --> 20:55.700]  It's terrible. Don't you wish
[20:55.700 --> 20:56.880]  you could get away with that in real life?
[20:57.760 --> 20:58.160]  What do you mean?
[21:00.680 --> 21:02.060]  Just berate somebody
[21:02.060 --> 21:03.300]  and then five minutes later go
[21:03.300 --> 21:05.100]  I have no idea what was going on.
[21:05.500 --> 21:06.520]  That was not me.
[21:07.080 --> 21:09.820]  I don't know, like even in the context of the movie
[21:09.820 --> 21:11.580]  it's not like void of consequences
[21:11.580 --> 21:13.900]  it's the implication is like my daughter
[21:13.900 --> 21:15.780]  fucking hates me and I don't know why.
[21:16.520 --> 21:17.580]  I don't know what I did.
[21:18.060 --> 21:19.760]  Yeah, but your kids are gonna hate you regardless
[21:19.760 --> 21:22.280]  for something. That's a fair point.
[21:22.800 --> 21:23.680]  Might as well give them a reason.
[21:24.340 --> 21:25.320]  That's a great argument.
[21:26.640 --> 21:27.940]  But that would be if you're looking
[21:27.940 --> 21:30.020]  for, as I'm not gonna claim
[21:30.020 --> 21:32.180]  to be a vibe sommelier, but if you need
[21:32.180 --> 21:33.760]  a dumb action movie watch
[21:33.760 --> 21:35.960]  that I feel like is kind of obscure at this
[21:35.960 --> 21:37.860]  point, Long Kiss Goodnight, pretty good.
[21:38.440 --> 21:39.860]  Yeah. Pretty good dumb action.
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.500]  Would you throw it into our
[21:41.500 --> 21:43.120]  MVP tuxedo pile?
[21:43.600 --> 21:45.740]  No, I don't think it's that.
[21:46.640 --> 21:47.820]  I think it's too good.
[21:48.300 --> 21:49.420]  Plus we have, don't forget
[21:49.420 --> 21:50.980]  Day of the Dolphin or whatever.
[21:51.340 --> 21:53.160]  Or Dolphin Day. We just keep adding weeks.
[21:53.440 --> 21:54.900]  I can't wait for us to actually watch it.
[21:54.900 --> 21:57.580]  Days of Dolphin Thunder. Apparently we have to buy something from each of these
[21:57.580 --> 21:59.560]  movies afterwards anyway, so we can't
[21:59.560 --> 22:00.140]  watch too many.
[22:01.080 --> 22:03.400]  Oh, I'd be so fucking cool to own the
[22:03.400 --> 22:05.740]  skateboard that the monkey rode in MVP 2.
[22:08.040 --> 22:08.480]  So...
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.560]  Andrew, is this a point
[22:09.560 --> 22:11.320]  where we can talk about that thing that you and I were
[22:11.760 --> 22:13.600]  discussing? Yeah, absolutely. I think that's
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.560]  fair, yeah. I thought you could have brought it up last time.
[22:15.860 --> 22:17.300]  We had an idea, well I didn't want to
[22:17.300 --> 22:19.580]  well, we had an idea for a fun
[22:19.580 --> 22:21.000]  thing to do, Gavin.
[22:21.860 --> 22:23.160]  And I wanted to present to you.
[22:23.980 --> 22:25.560]  So like, when we go and
[22:25.560 --> 22:27.560]  do, well if we
[22:27.560 --> 22:29.520]  ever do like live shows, or maybe not
[22:29.520 --> 22:30.920]  even for that, just as it's own thing.
[22:31.320 --> 22:33.380]  I feel like what we do at F***face
[22:33.860 --> 22:35.520]  is we collect hilarious
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.480]  stories of funny things that
[22:37.480 --> 22:39.480]  we encounter or that we discover around the world.
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.360]  Like Bussy is a great example.
[22:41.620 --> 22:43.560]  Here we got a hockey player who was traded for a
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.460]  bus, right? It doesn't get any funnier
[22:45.460 --> 22:47.460]  than that. Billy Ripken and
[22:47.460 --> 22:49.220]  the F***face baseball bat.
[22:49.540 --> 22:50.600]  Yadda, yadda, yadda. All that.
[22:52.240 --> 22:53.220]  And we were thinking,
[22:53.500 --> 22:55.380]  wouldn't it be cool if we could display that in
[22:55.380 --> 22:57.580]  some way? And that, like, almost like a Ripley's
[22:57.580 --> 22:59.460]  Believe It or Not, but what
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.340]  if we called it a F***face
[23:01.880 --> 23:03.640]  Believe It Cuz Why Not?
[23:04.060 --> 23:05.480]  And then you just...
[23:06.520 --> 23:06.880]  Right?
[23:08.580 --> 23:09.460]  Believe it cuz
[23:09.460 --> 23:11.760]  why not, right? Cuz we're not trying to lie to you.
[23:12.520 --> 23:13.480]  What do we have to gain
[23:13.480 --> 23:15.560]  by this? And we create, it's like a little mini
[23:15.560 --> 23:17.560]  art gallery museum that we can take with
[23:17.560 --> 23:19.380]  us and set up. And it's got like
[23:19.380 --> 23:21.680]  the tuxedo is the main thing,
[23:21.760 --> 23:23.700]  right, you go? And Andrew was even saying
[23:23.700 --> 23:25.560]  we could have like a little, we could even have
[23:25.560 --> 23:27.480]  like a little gift shop at the end and you can buy a shirt
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.580]  that just has a picture of a tuxedo on it
[23:29.580 --> 23:31.200]  that says, I saw it.
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.280]  And treat it like a really big deal.
[23:33.280 --> 23:35.060]  And then we could do like, I could project
[23:35.060 --> 23:37.140]  until I can build it, I could project like the
[23:37.940 --> 23:39.220]  Don Pedro project
[23:39.220 --> 23:40.840]  up on the wall with a projector
[23:40.840 --> 23:43.380]  and we could have like all the funny little
[23:43.380 --> 23:45.100]  weird foibles and
[23:45.100 --> 23:46.560]  oddities that we amass
[23:46.560 --> 23:49.240]  and that we invent over time. And just
[23:49.240 --> 23:51.120]  really celebrate it in this museum setting
[23:51.120 --> 23:53.380]  and then charge people like 50 cents to come in or something.
[23:54.280 --> 23:55.280]  Ripkins Believe It
[23:55.280 --> 23:57.420]  Why Not? You have just created
[23:57.420 --> 23:59.400]  my new favorite part of this, Geoff. The concept
[23:59.400 --> 24:01.380]  of having like a tour guide
[24:02.360 --> 24:03.080]  tell stories
[24:03.080 --> 24:05.240]  with the attitude of like, fuck off
[24:05.240 --> 24:07.360]  I don't give a shit. What, you don't believe this?
[24:07.420 --> 24:09.460]  Fuck you. I don't care. Fucking leave
[24:09.460 --> 24:10.820]  then. I don't give a shit.
[24:12.160 --> 24:13.420]  I gain nothing by
[24:13.420 --> 24:14.840]  this lie. Why would I lie about this?
[24:14.840 --> 24:17.100]  This is our reputation. I love this.
[24:17.180 --> 24:19.400]  This is great. Anyway, we just thought that would
[24:19.400 --> 24:21.440]  be, we're just amassing so many funny little
[24:21.440 --> 24:23.340]  things like, someday maybe we could get a piece
[24:23.340 --> 24:25.440]  of the bus. And then we could put it up
[24:25.440 --> 24:27.660]  on, like on a pedestal
[24:27.660 --> 24:29.500]  and then have the story and you could get like a little
[24:29.500 --> 24:31.620]  put headphones on and listen to Andrew tell the bussy
[24:31.620 --> 24:33.620]  story or have an aggressive tour
[24:33.620 --> 24:35.620]  guide explain it to you. I never even
[24:35.620 --> 24:37.760]  considered that bus might still be out there.
[24:37.860 --> 24:39.680]  That bus probably exists in some
[24:39.680 --> 24:41.720]  form somewhere. Dude, I would love
[24:41.720 --> 24:43.720]  to track that bus down. I was thinking along similar
[24:43.720 --> 24:45.400]  lines. I was watching the
[24:45.400 --> 24:47.460]  Price is Right the other day with Emily
[24:47.460 --> 24:49.460]  not like New Price is Right with Drew Carey but like
[24:49.460 --> 24:51.640]  an old ass like 80, it was like 83
[24:52.160 --> 24:53.540]  with, there's like a Price is Right
[24:53.540 --> 24:55.460]  channel that's always got it on on TV
[24:55.460 --> 24:57.580]  and with Bob Barker when he
[24:57.580 --> 24:59.580]  was still old, even in
[24:59.580 --> 25:00.940]  like 1980, he was still old.
[25:01.900 --> 25:02.420]  Phenomenal.
[25:03.520 --> 25:05.560]  In some ways he looked older in
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.700]  1983 than he did in Happy Gilmore.
[25:07.840 --> 25:08.900]  I don't know how he did that.
[25:09.700 --> 25:11.580]  But anyway, and you see people
[25:11.580 --> 25:13.280]  win like a Pontiac Fiero
[25:13.280 --> 25:15.520]  and then you think like, is that still
[25:15.520 --> 25:17.460]  out there? Like is somebody still driving
[25:17.460 --> 25:19.340]  around that award vehicle?
[25:19.520 --> 25:21.680]  Is somebody still using a jet
[25:21.680 --> 25:23.360]  ski or a bedroom
[25:23.360 --> 25:25.820]  set or an electric toothbrush?
[25:25.820 --> 25:28.040]  Probably not. But you know, or like
[25:28.040 --> 25:29.960]  lawn furniture or
[25:29.960 --> 25:31.560]  you know what I mean? Or like a hot tub.
[25:32.180 --> 25:33.760]  Surely something somebody won
[25:33.760 --> 25:35.780]  on a game show in like
[25:35.780 --> 25:37.860]  1987 is still in
[25:37.860 --> 25:39.620]  use and turned out to be like
[25:39.620 --> 25:41.620]  the best winning ever.
[25:41.940 --> 25:44.040]  You can't throw away something that you won on television
[25:44.040 --> 25:45.840]  unless it's like a built in
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.660]  kitchen or something that fell apart.
[25:47.680 --> 25:49.940]  I think almost all of that stuff
[25:49.940 --> 25:51.900]  goes away pretty quickly. I think people
[25:51.900 --> 25:53.260]  get rid of it almost immediately.
[25:54.080 --> 25:55.300]  I also feel like
[25:55.300 --> 25:57.300]  isn't there a thing where you have to pay
[25:57.300 --> 25:59.360]  for like, you have to pay the
[25:59.360 --> 26:01.360]  taxes on it immediately to get it?
[26:01.460 --> 26:03.260]  So I wonder how many of those are like, you can
[26:03.260 --> 26:04.960]  either have this hot tub or
[26:04.960 --> 26:07.040]  a prize amount of this value.
[26:07.320 --> 26:09.300]  It's a very American thing to
[26:09.300 --> 26:11.460]  pay tax on a prize. I think it's the same with a lottery
[26:11.460 --> 26:13.440]  isn't it? Whereas an
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.320]  English lottery is just you get a load of money.
[26:15.880 --> 26:17.220]  I think it's like, it's probably
[26:17.220 --> 26:19.280]  similar to, like I read this a few years ago, so I don't
[26:19.280 --> 26:20.280]  know if it's still true, but
[26:20.280 --> 26:22.480]  on Hell's Kitchen
[26:22.480 --> 26:24.280]  that Gordon Ramsay TV show
[26:24.280 --> 26:26.180]  where he, you know, people
[26:26.180 --> 26:28.420]  compete to be an apprentice and then you get to
[26:28.420 --> 26:30.200]  be a head chef at one of his
[26:30.200 --> 26:32.200]  restaurants around the world. I think
[26:32.200 --> 26:34.260]  I read, this is around like maybe season 12
[26:34.260 --> 26:36.340]  or 13, that no one
[26:36.340 --> 26:38.160]  had ever actually done the job.
[26:38.460 --> 26:40.220]  Like, it always fell through every
[26:40.220 --> 26:42.180]  time because of visas or
[26:42.180 --> 26:43.920]  because of like arrest records
[26:43.920 --> 26:46.140]  or because of just like
[26:46.140 --> 26:48.240]  the Gordon Ramsay team didn't respond
[26:48.240 --> 26:49.740]  and just like dropped it, like
[26:49.740 --> 26:52.260]  people get the prize money but they never actually get to do
[26:52.260 --> 26:54.260]  the other part of the prize, which makes me think that
[26:54.260 --> 26:56.220]  probably most game shows and award
[26:56.220 --> 26:58.000]  shows and all those things are largely
[26:58.000 --> 26:58.500]  bullshit.
[27:01.100 --> 27:01.900]  It's terrible.
[27:02.580 --> 27:02.920]  Yeah.
[27:03.940 --> 27:06.380]  Like, oh, you're gonna go be the head chef at Gordon
[27:06.380 --> 27:08.140]  Ramsay Steakhouse in Lake Tahoe.
[27:08.400 --> 27:10.400]  No, you're not. You're gonna get 150 grand
[27:10.400 --> 27:12.320]  and maybe you get out to go out there for two weeks
[27:12.320 --> 27:14.120]  but yeah. The idea of winning
[27:14.120 --> 27:16.300]  a job is comical in itself. It is.
[27:16.300 --> 27:16.880]  100%.
[27:18.660 --> 27:19.880]  And I'm sure
[27:19.880 --> 27:22.100]  a lot of people are probably faced with it too.
[27:22.200 --> 27:23.360]  They're like, say what now?
[27:23.780 --> 27:25.980]  I wanted to be on TV. I didn't want to actually move
[27:25.980 --> 27:28.100]  across the country. I got a kid in school,
[27:28.200 --> 27:28.500]  you know?
[27:30.700 --> 27:32.040]  But yeah, so I think
[27:32.040 --> 27:34.320]  I would love to know if any comment
[27:34.320 --> 27:36.220]  leaver or regulation listener who
[27:36.220 --> 27:38.220]  has a family member who ever won something
[27:38.220 --> 27:40.220]  on a television show, are they still
[27:40.220 --> 27:42.080]  using it? Do they still have access to it?
[27:42.600 --> 27:44.360]  Yeah, kind of like a where are they now
[27:44.360 --> 27:45.580]  but just like where is it now?
[27:46.980 --> 27:48.560]  Speaking of winning a job,
[27:48.800 --> 27:50.500]  Richard Branson tried to do his
[27:50.500 --> 27:52.200]  own version of The Apprentice
[27:52.200 --> 27:54.140]  in the early thousands and I loved it.
[27:54.480 --> 27:56.080]  It was ridiculous where it was like
[27:56.080 --> 27:58.360]  all these executives and somebody's
[27:58.360 --> 28:00.280]  gonna become some sector
[28:00.280 --> 28:02.340]  of Virgin or something, like they're gonna be
[28:02.340 --> 28:04.500]  high up in the company. And it would be like
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.300]  okay, so to prove this, you're gonna
[28:06.300 --> 28:08.500]  have to walk between two floating air
[28:08.500 --> 28:10.560]  balloons. And this is gonna prove
[28:10.560 --> 28:12.040]  that you're tough and
[28:12.040 --> 28:13.680]  you're good under pressure.
[28:14.080 --> 28:15.940]  It was these physical challenges
[28:15.940 --> 28:17.640]  that had nothing to do with business
[28:17.640 --> 28:20.080]  weirdly constructed to be like, no, this is
[28:20.080 --> 28:21.960]  how actually this reflects into the
[28:21.960 --> 28:23.780]  business world. You wanna sit on our board?
[28:24.020 --> 28:25.580]  Do a backflip. Yeah!
[28:25.900 --> 28:27.840]  And so, they get to the finale
[28:27.840 --> 28:29.440]  and he's like, congratulations,
[28:30.020 --> 28:31.800]  you've won, but there's a twist.
[28:32.260 --> 28:34.180]  The prize amount is half a million
[28:34.180 --> 28:35.980]  dollars. I have this
[28:35.980 --> 28:38.340]  coin. We can flip a coin
[28:38.340 --> 28:40.000]  and if you guess what side
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.780]  it will land on, you will get
[28:41.780 --> 28:43.880]  one million dollars. Or
[28:43.880 --> 28:46.120]  you can just take the current prize
[28:46.120 --> 28:48.080]  money as is. If you
[28:48.080 --> 28:50.020]  flip and it's wrong, you lose everything
[28:50.020 --> 28:51.980]  or you can double your money, essentially.
[28:52.360 --> 28:54.060]  Take the money. And the guy
[28:54.060 --> 28:55.880]  like, they went to a commercial break
[28:55.880 --> 28:58.200]  to try to build tension. Like this is like a 15
[28:58.200 --> 29:00.020]  minute... he was talking to other contestants
[29:00.020 --> 29:01.840]  about it. They really built it up
[29:01.840 --> 29:04.240]  and then he's like, you know what, like I really appreciate
[29:04.240 --> 29:05.900]  obviously a million dollars is awesome
[29:05.900 --> 29:07.580]  but it's just too much to risk.
[29:07.580 --> 29:09.380]  And then he said no.
[29:09.760 --> 29:11.780]  And Richard Branson was like, you're a genius.
[29:12.180 --> 29:13.660]  You passed the final test.
[29:13.860 --> 29:15.640]  If you would have said yes, you would
[29:15.640 --> 29:17.560]  have lost everything. Because it's
[29:17.560 --> 29:19.760]  important to know in business when you should
[29:19.760 --> 29:21.460]  and shouldn't take... like it was a complete
[29:21.460 --> 29:23.600]  bullshit twist. I always wondered if he said
[29:23.600 --> 29:25.500]  yes, like would the show just end with
[29:25.500 --> 29:27.740]  no winner? Because he designated... he beat
[29:27.740 --> 29:29.780]  somebody else. Or would they reshoot
[29:29.780 --> 29:31.580]  it? Richard Branson would have said, you
[29:31.580 --> 29:33.560]  just passed the test to truly
[29:33.560 --> 29:35.580]  succeed in business. You have to be fearless.
[29:35.580 --> 29:37.740]  You have to take risks. Whether you win
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.560]  or lose this coin flip, it shows
[29:39.560 --> 29:41.560]  that you've got the balls and the moxie
[29:41.560 --> 29:43.320]  to be a CEO or whatever. It was
[29:43.320 --> 29:44.160]  designed to win.
[29:45.380 --> 29:47.560]  It was ridiculous. It was a 20 minute
[29:47.560 --> 29:49.660]  thing that they built up and had no point to it
[29:49.660 --> 29:51.640]  ultimately. What would you have done? I think
[29:51.640 --> 29:53.160]  I definitely would have flipped the coin.
[29:53.460 --> 29:55.520]  Almost undeniably. Really? Well, okay.
[29:55.660 --> 29:57.600]  Let me change this. Prior
[29:57.600 --> 29:59.560]  to when we flipped coins on this show
[29:59.560 --> 30:01.720]  and I went one for like 32,
[30:02.300 --> 30:03.500]  I probably would have flipped.
[30:03.500 --> 30:05.380]  In this world in which we've done that
[30:05.380 --> 30:07.420]  now? No way. I wouldn't
[30:07.420 --> 30:09.420]  if I were you. No, I'm not going to flip.
[30:09.880 --> 30:11.500]  I mean, going from zero to half a
[30:11.500 --> 30:13.500]  million is almost the same as going
[30:13.500 --> 30:14.640]  from zero to a million.
[30:16.260 --> 30:17.540]  It's the worst. There's
[30:17.540 --> 30:19.680]  some other reality show I watched where at the end
[30:19.680 --> 30:21.560]  they could win a million dollars
[30:21.560 --> 30:23.220]  or risk it all and everybody
[30:23.220 --> 30:25.400]  would risk it all. Or I guess the
[30:25.400 --> 30:27.440]  first guy risked it all and he was like, yeah, I'm doing this for
[30:27.440 --> 30:29.700]  my family so my kid can go to college
[30:29.700 --> 30:31.460]  and he was barely off and he
[30:31.460 --> 30:33.340]  got nothing. It turned really depressing,
[30:33.500 --> 30:35.480]  the game show. It's supposed to be a fun watch people
[30:35.480 --> 30:37.620]  win money and seeing people lose
[30:37.620 --> 30:39.420]  large amounts getting caught up in the moment
[30:39.420 --> 30:41.500]  was devastating. Yeah, especially
[30:41.500 --> 30:43.400]  because his kid wasn't going to go to million
[30:43.400 --> 30:44.480]  dollar college.
[30:45.280 --> 30:46.480]  You know what I mean?
[30:47.700 --> 30:49.040]  If we pretended
[30:49.040 --> 30:51.300]  to do the coin flip now and you picked
[30:51.840 --> 30:53.000]  correctly, would you be annoyed?
[30:53.600 --> 30:55.120]  Uh, no.
[30:55.120 --> 30:57.460]  Just that it wasn't real? Well, what do you mean?
[30:58.020 --> 30:59.460]  Like if we were like, do the...
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.080]  Yeah, like Eric, flip the coin now.
[31:01.320 --> 31:02.980]  You call it, Andrew, for a million dollars.
[31:03.420 --> 31:05.660]  Do you think you'd get it? I think I would get it.
[31:06.020 --> 31:07.740]  I'm feeling pretty strong. Eric, do you have a coin?
[31:08.480 --> 31:09.480]  Gavin, you're British.
[31:09.600 --> 31:10.480]  Can you be Richard Branson?
[31:11.380 --> 31:13.760]  Oh, Eric's saying, okay, we have a feed.
[31:14.200 --> 31:15.300]  I hope you're rolling on this.
[31:15.840 --> 31:17.400]  I'm watching. Gavin,
[31:17.460 --> 31:19.280]  do you want to do all the Britishisms
[31:19.280 --> 31:21.820]  of it? Like, all the
[31:21.820 --> 31:23.180]  patter and then tell me when to flip?
[31:23.840 --> 31:24.980]  Yeah, alright, Andrew.
[31:25.820 --> 31:27.100]  You got half a million.
[31:27.100 --> 31:29.460]  Want a million? You got flip a coin.
[31:29.900 --> 31:30.500]  Over to Eric.
[31:31.800 --> 31:32.680]  Uh, Tails.
[31:33.280 --> 31:34.040]  I'm gonna go with Tails.
[31:34.920 --> 31:36.040]  It's always Tails.
[31:37.300 --> 31:39.700]  Why do you have that coin?
[31:40.060 --> 31:41.100]  Because it's from some
[31:41.100 --> 31:42.500]  other time we flipped coins.
[31:43.740 --> 31:45.300]  There was another thing in the show
[31:45.300 --> 31:46.620]  where we flipped coins. This is Tails.
[31:46.960 --> 31:48.660]  It's a bird. The other one's JFK.
[31:48.720 --> 31:49.380]  It's a real coin.
[31:50.280 --> 31:53.080]  I'm going to catch it and then flip it over
[31:53.080 --> 31:54.240]  on my hand.
[31:54.240 --> 31:55.400]  Yeah, okay.
[31:56.140 --> 31:57.300]  It's for you, so I'm excited.
[31:57.960 --> 32:00.520]  And you're pre-cooling heads. You're not cooling it in the air.
[32:00.580 --> 32:01.860]  Interesting. I'm calling Tails.
[32:02.120 --> 32:02.840]  I think you called Tails.
[32:04.420 --> 32:06.300]  Geoff, please confirm that he called Tails.
[32:06.460 --> 32:07.940]  Geoff, I have to say that he called Tails
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.220]  and then we can do this.
[32:09.280 --> 32:12.160]  He called Tails. I wasn't paying attention, but I'll...
[32:12.160 --> 32:14.100]  He paid more attention than I was, apparently.
[32:15.320 --> 32:16.060]  Okay, here we go!
[32:16.520 --> 32:17.720]  Okay, he's flipping the coin.
[32:18.400 --> 32:20.400]  He catches the coin. What is it?
[32:20.720 --> 32:21.000]  What is it?
[32:21.600 --> 32:22.300]  It's heads.
[32:22.440 --> 32:22.800]  Oh!
[32:24.020 --> 32:26.760]  I was subliminally trying to get you to go heads.
[32:27.660 --> 32:29.120]  Can we do double or nothing?
[32:29.700 --> 32:31.240]  Richard, can we do double or nothing?
[32:31.700 --> 32:32.900]  That's the end of the show!
[32:33.020 --> 32:35.420]  You've been taught a valuable lesson about business.
[32:35.880 --> 32:37.480]  I don't even have a plane ticket home.
[32:41.200 --> 32:42.120]  Roll the credits!
[32:44.480 --> 32:45.620]  I'm going to space.
[32:46.240 --> 32:47.740]  I like that you start season two
[32:47.740 --> 32:49.160]  and I'm still just on the premises
[32:49.160 --> 32:49.920]  trying to leave.
[32:50.280 --> 32:52.480]  Just stuck there.
[32:53.240 --> 32:55.000]  Can I have the coin for bus fare?
[32:57.040 --> 32:58.720]  That was a really good Richard Branson, Gavin.
[32:59.080 --> 32:59.440]  Thanks.
[32:59.660 --> 33:02.320]  I always forget what a natural actor you are.
[33:09.120 --> 33:12.000]  Now a word from our sponsor, BetterHelp.
[33:12.680 --> 33:14.120]  Being burnt out is a dreadful
[33:14.120 --> 33:15.940]  feeling that can impact so many areas
[33:15.940 --> 33:17.720]  of your life. When I'm struggling
[33:17.720 --> 33:19.540]  with it, I find it hard to stay focused
[33:19.540 --> 33:21.540]  or motivated, whether that's at work
[33:21.540 --> 33:23.660]  or in my personal life, which then
[33:23.660 --> 33:25.540]  creates feelings of guilt and anxiety
[33:25.540 --> 33:27.940]  and it all snowballs into one big overwhelming
[33:27.940 --> 33:29.620]  thing that has led me to hit
[33:29.620 --> 33:30.860]  a breaking point in the past.

[33:42.440 --> 33:43.760]  Being able to talk with someone
[33:43.760 --> 33:45.640]  and sort through those feelings has had a massive
[33:45.640 --> 33:47.620]  impact in my life, so I would highly

[36:33.080 --> 36:37.920]  He's in space now, right? Richard Branson, he's one of the space guys? Right now? Well,
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.220]  not like right now, but I feel like he was one of the, I feel like since like the mid-thousands,
[36:42.360 --> 36:46.600]  he was like, I'm going to space, we're going to have space travel. Is he doing that yet?
[36:46.940 --> 36:51.860]  Is that a thing? Yeah. Okay. You can just go to space through Richard Branson? I mean,
[36:51.880 --> 36:57.220]  if you're a billionaire, you get to go to space. Yeah. I feel like I would have to go
[36:57.220 --> 37:01.560]  on his airline before I trusted him to take me into space. I wouldn't trust it. You know
[37:01.560 --> 37:06.300]  how many billionaires die in like a helicopter crash? It's just even more risky than that.
[37:06.380 --> 37:11.740]  Is it more than there are words for edges to describe edges? Because it's the same measurement.
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.740]  We got like one. I will say, to be fair to billionaires and helicopter crashes, they
[37:18.740 --> 37:23.220]  do, I think you're right, like super rich people die in helicopter crashes more, but
[37:23.220 --> 37:29.340]  it's also because they take like incalculably more helicopter rides than we do. That's true.
[37:29.800 --> 37:34.720]  Like if you take 10,000, like if you take a helicopter ride four times a day, every
[37:34.720 --> 37:39.900]  day, I mean, yeah, eventually maybe you're going to crash, but I think that the percentage
[37:39.900 --> 37:44.680]  is probably about the same. I'm sure statistically it's safer than a car, but you just, it's
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.980]  just how the rich die a lot. Yeah. Unfortunately. Is it? Is it how they die a lot? I don't,
[37:49.980 --> 37:56.220]  I don't, I don't know if that's statistically accurate. Also, it's the only version of let's
[37:56.220 --> 38:00.840]  be fair to billionaires that I can get behind Geoff. When you first opened that as a, like,
[38:00.980 --> 38:04.740]  what are we fucking talking about? Then you're like helicopter crash. I'm not saying they're
[38:04.740 --> 38:08.540]  good people or anything. I'm just saying they fly in more helicopters than we do. So they
[38:08.540 --> 38:12.160]  have a higher chance. You're going to notice more billionaires crashing just because they're
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.960]  the only ones taking the helicopter rides. When was the last time you rode in a helicopter?
[38:15.960 --> 38:24.240]  Uh, three weeks after Kobe Bryant died. Um, Emily and I were on vacation in Hawaii and the hotel
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.640]  we were staying at had the, uh, Magnum PI helicopter. You could rent it for a helicopter rides.
[38:29.780 --> 38:36.180]  And so, uh, we rented it and then they were like for extra money. Have I never told this story?
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.860]  No. No. Oh, okay. Well shit. Let me tell it then. Let me, I hadn't prepared it, but, um,
[38:42.560 --> 38:46.080]  so Emily and I are staying at this, uh, it's actually at the place where they,
[38:46.240 --> 38:49.560]  where they did Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I think, if I'm remembering correctly.
[38:50.220 --> 38:58.540]  Uh, and at this place, uh, they have helicopter rides. And I found out later that Emily had been,
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.980]  uh, navigating as far away from the helicopter rides as possible. Every time we went anywhere
[39:04.980 --> 39:09.380]  without me knowing it because she was terrified, I would see the helicopter and want to take a
[39:09.380 --> 39:13.900]  ride because she deathly did not want to. I found, I found that out about a month ago.
[39:14.200 --> 39:18.940]  This was like the reverse of swans. Yeah. It was like the reverse of swans. So apparently she had
[39:18.940 --> 39:24.660]  been walking the long way around to get to stuff so that I would never see the helipad. And, uh,
[39:26.100 --> 39:33.400]  she just admitted that to me like a couple months ago. Uh, this was January, February, 2019. Uh,
[39:33.400 --> 39:39.840]  so, uh, one day we're renting bikes to go ride around the beach. And, uh, I see the, I see the
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.520]  Magnum PI helicopter and I go, Hey, what's that? And she goes, Oh, uh, that's a, that's a helicopter.
[39:44.580 --> 39:51.920]  And I go for like, like for people. And the lady at the bike place, she goes, Oh yeah. Yeah. You
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.400]  can rent the helicopter. Lots of people do it. It's a, it's really, it's fun. You go out for an
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.780]  hour and I went, can we, can we rent the helicopter? And she's like, yeah, yeah. I can
[40:01.780 --> 40:05.680]  actually book it from over here. And Emily's like, yeah, let's do it. I didn't realize that
[40:05.680 --> 40:13.620]  on the inside, she was like, dear God, no. So we rent the helicopter and, uh, we go to get on it
[40:13.620 --> 40:16.940]  and they're like giving us a safety briefing and stuff. And then the guy comes in and he goes,
[40:17.340 --> 40:22.560]  yeah, we're having a problem with the new one. Uh, well, anyway, we're just not going to take
[40:22.560 --> 40:25.140]  it. We're just not going to take it. That's okay though. Cause we have the old helicopter.
[40:25.300 --> 40:29.540]  We haven't mothballed it yet. Uh, we keep it around just for, you know, these kinds of instances. So
[40:29.540 --> 40:33.700]  we haven't flown it in a while, but trust me, it'd still be fine. And so that was not great to hear
[40:33.700 --> 40:37.660]  that the new helicopter wasn't safe. Uh, and they couldn't drive it. And they,
[40:37.660 --> 40:46.340]  they like pulled the old one out of retirement. Like it had one last mission. Uh, and, uh,
[40:46.400 --> 40:51.940]  and so up and a bunch of wasps come out of the room when they, when they cut this and they go,
[40:52.040 --> 40:55.980]  all right, now we can do it two ways. We can do it with doors on doors off. And I go, excuse me?
[40:56.060 --> 40:59.460]  And they go, yeah, we take the doors off. That way you just have fresh air. And I go doors off,
[40:59.460 --> 41:03.140]  doors off, doors off, doors off. And I didn't even, I didn't even look at Emily. I was just
[41:03.140 --> 41:07.820]  like, yeah, we want the doors off. And Emily's like, yeah, doors off. And they're like, no
[41:07.820 --> 41:15.260]  problem. And then they put us in this helicopter and I buckle. They buckle you. They don't buckle
[41:15.260 --> 41:18.740]  you and you buckle yourself in. I get in the back on the right side. Emily gets in the back on the
[41:18.740 --> 41:23.220]  left side. And I realized that without the door, cause that thing's like the Magnum PI helicopter
[41:23.220 --> 41:29.060]  is kind of like a bubble that would, the door is about 40% of the wall. And, uh, because it's
[41:29.060 --> 41:35.820]  convex, right? Um, I'd say about a third of me is hanging out of the helicopter. And now I've been
[41:35.820 --> 41:40.580]  on a lot of helicopters. I was in the army for five years. I was a photographer. I flew in
[41:40.580 --> 41:45.580]  helicopters constantly. I would go into Blackhawks all the time. And every time I would get into a
[41:45.580 --> 41:49.240]  Blackhawk, the pilot would go, Hey, you ever flown in a Blackhawk before? And I'd go, yes,
[41:49.240 --> 41:53.280]  many times you don't have to do the thing. And he goes, I'm about to scare the piss out of you.
[41:53.360 --> 41:56.780]  And they go up in the air and they turn sideways and you're just hanging monkey strapped in,
[41:56.780 --> 42:00.120]  like looking at the ground and you go, ah, and they've turned it right back. And then,
[42:00.180 --> 42:04.700]  and then every helicopter pilot on earth does that. Uh, and it really, it's really old,
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.300]  really fast. And no matter how many times you say like it's, you guys have done it before.
[42:09.300 --> 42:12.800]  I don't have to like, it's, it's everybody's it's every pilot's perverse pleasure. Right?
[42:12.860 --> 42:18.220]  So I feel pretty well versed in helicopters. Uh, so, but I'm, I'm not kidding when I feel like,
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.180]  like a third of my ass cheek is hanging out of the plane and I'm not a big dude, you know,
[42:23.180 --> 42:30.140]  I'd say from my right nipple out is outside just, just air. Uh, so I'm like, it's like,
[42:30.200 --> 42:36.000]  I've only got one nipple in the plane. Uh, and I'm like, well, that's a lot smaller than I thought
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.720]  it was. That's kind of weird. And then I go to like, find the monkey straps to go in and I'm
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.480]  looking around and they're like, no, no, it's a lap belt. And I look and it's just like, it's like
[42:44.480 --> 42:54.660]  the seatbelt from a 1978 Ford F-150. It's just like, and it's old. And like it, I swear to God,
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.580]  it says GM on it. I think like, it just looks like an old car. Like, like if you bump it wrong,
[43:00.620 --> 43:04.780]  it's going to come, come apart. Right. And I'm like, where's the rest? And they're like, that's
[43:04.780 --> 43:09.200]  all you need. You're fine. And I'm like, this is the only seatbelt in this plane or helicopter.
[43:09.300 --> 43:12.280]  And they're like, Hey, you'll be fine. And I'm like figuring all this out. And I look over at
[43:12.280 --> 43:17.320]  Emily and Emily does not look good. And I go, are you okay? And she goes, yeah, I'm fine.
[43:17.580 --> 43:24.220]  And then the helicopter takes off. We get one foot in the air and I go, oh my God, this is
[43:24.220 --> 43:30.480]  incredibly scary. Like instantly I look at Emily. She's immediately starts crying. Just immediately
[43:30.480 --> 43:38.080]  starts crying. Like we're not even, we're a foot off the ground. Right. And she's crying and I'm
[43:38.080 --> 43:45.240]  on the inside crying, but I look at her and I see how, I see how terrified she is. And I go,
[43:45.340 --> 43:48.900]  got to be brave, got to be brave for Emily. So I like eat it. I just eat all my fear.
[43:49.500 --> 43:55.600]  And of which there is, uh, uh, like a seven course meals worth of, and then we take off
[43:55.600 --> 44:02.020]  and then we're up in the air and we're up in the air. And then it's an, it's an hour. We got the
[44:02.020 --> 44:11.920]  hour long one. She closes her eyes and keeps them closed for the entire hour. That's not true. I
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.060]  think she opened them over Pearl Harbor briefly. Cause I was like, you gotta see this. So she opens
[44:16.060 --> 44:22.040]  them briefly, saw the crashed boats and she was like, okay, close your eyes again. And we then
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.200]  it's like, it's not so bad. We go over the beach and like, that's scary, but it's like, I can still
[44:26.200 --> 44:30.760]  see people on the beach. And like, if I fell, the sand is soft. If I fall in the water, that's,
[44:30.760 --> 44:34.660]  I probably live there. But then, and then we go over and we look at like, go over to like the
[44:34.660 --> 44:39.180]  punch bowl. And then you go over to, you see where a Pearl Harbor happened. And that's all very
[44:39.180 --> 44:43.540]  scary, but it's still like, you can see cars moving around and stuff. And it's like, you feel
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.060]  you're still hanging ass out. I'm still nipple out of the plane or the helicopter. Right. And that,
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.900]  and it's very cold up there, even though it's hot in Hawaii and it's very windy. But when it gets
[44:52.900 --> 44:57.800]  really, really bad is when we go to the mountains and they're like, let's go see where they filmed
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.720]  King Kong and Jurassic Park. And you're like, okay. And then you're in these mountains and then
[45:02.720 --> 45:08.120]  you're climbing with the mountains. And suddenly the helicopter is getting so throttled with wind
[45:08.120 --> 45:12.020]  that it's going like, you can't see my hand right now, but it's like 10 feet to the left,
[45:12.100 --> 45:16.640]  10 feet to the right, up, down. It's like, it's like somebody shaking dice and on the,
[45:16.720 --> 45:23.120]  we're the dice. And I'm like, just trying not to piss my pants out of fear. And it's like 40
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.560]  degrees up there and freezing and it's incredibly windy and it's wet. So you're getting blasted
[45:28.560 --> 45:33.460]  with water in the face and it's slippery. And I'm just like trying to find anything inside the
[45:33.460 --> 45:38.180]  helicopter to hold onto. And there's nothing really except for like one arm thing to hold.
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.420]  And I'm just holding the seat belt, just trying to hold it closed with my other hand. And I'm
[45:42.420 --> 45:48.700]  like, I'm kind of going like, I'm kind of crying to myself a little bit in these mountains because
[45:48.700 --> 45:53.300]  it is so fucking scary. And we're getting just thrown or like batted around like a cat batting
[45:53.300 --> 45:56.680]  a mouse around in the air. Did you have a headset on so you could talk to each other?
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.580]  I don't, I don't remember. I don't think so. I must've had headsets on. Yeah. Because he was
[46:04.580 --> 46:07.860]  telling us stuff, but I don't think we talked back. I think we just cried to ourselves.
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.060]  And every once in a while I'd look over at Emily and like touch her hand or whatever. But,
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.060]  and she would just be sitting there just silently crying with her eyes closed.
[46:15.060 --> 46:20.840]  And we did that for an hour. Uh, and then we landed and I've never been so happy to be on
[46:20.840 --> 46:23.680]  land again. And I don't know that I'll ever need to take another helicopter ride again,
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.400]  but if I do, I guarantee you, I will keep the doors on. It is an entirely different thing to,
[46:29.480 --> 46:35.840]  to be nipple out of that little bubble. 10,000 feet in the air over a mountain
[46:35.840 --> 46:41.880]  while you're getting hit with gale storm winds. I like that Emily got the visual equivalent of
[46:41.880 --> 46:48.140]  Googling aerial shot of Pearl Harbor. Yes. Yes. Yeah. But she had, she had all the nausea
[46:48.660 --> 46:57.160]  of a real experience. Oh God. I don't think I want to go on one. Yeah. I don't think I've ever
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.640]  been on one and I don't, I don't really have an interest. Very different experience in an
[47:01.640 --> 47:07.560]  enclosed helicopter versus that one that I was on. So did you book the Magnum one and the Magnum
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.560]  one didn't work? Or did you book a different one and ended up in the Magnum? They were both
[47:11.560 --> 47:17.360]  Magnum. They were both Magnum. So they got like a new, a new Magnum one. If I was going to die in
[47:17.360 --> 47:22.880]  a helicopter crash, I think I would want it to be in the Magnum. I totally agree. Totally agree.
[47:23.220 --> 47:27.080]  Totally. Yeah. Yeah. I can't think of a more iconic helicopter than the Magnum.
[47:28.160 --> 47:34.900]  That factored into my decision-making. I thought, uh, tragic that the Kobe thing just happened.
[47:34.900 --> 47:39.300]  Right. Obviously. But what a better time to ride in a helicopter than right now, because every
[47:39.300 --> 47:43.880]  pilot has got to be extra safe, right? Like it's on everybody's mind. So everybody's probably being
[47:43.880 --> 47:48.980]  really self-conscious and conscientious and really safe with like all the protocols and everything.
[47:49.620 --> 47:55.180]  And, and then also, uh, nobody dies in like TV fandom stuff. Like I'm not going to die in a
[47:55.180 --> 48:00.260]  mad, like the mystery machine doesn't, doesn't go off a bridge and kill people. Right. Like,
[48:00.260 --> 48:07.640]  I'll be fine. Uh, because it's the Magnum PI helicopter. And so that led me to make that mistake.
[48:08.740 --> 48:13.480]  So you're saying that billionaires do not buy novelty helicopters. That's those, those...
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.940]  Oh, I'm saying billionaires probably should. They probably should be. Like Eric said, nobody died
[48:18.940 --> 48:23.020]  in a Batmobile. Like if I was a billionaire, I'd drive around in a Batmobile or an Oscar Mayer
[48:23.020 --> 48:29.120]  Wiener car. And you'd be safe forever. If you could buy any movie vehicle, what would it be?
[48:29.280 --> 48:36.020]  Movie or TV show? Any type of vehicle could be anything. Anything that moves. I'm trying to think
[48:36.020 --> 48:42.580]  something that's not the DeLorean. Is it a replica, like, is it from the movie or is it like,
[48:42.660 --> 48:47.220]  does it work as the movie works? It's like a functional, it works as how the movie works.
[48:47.500 --> 48:55.420]  Let's go with that. It's a functional version of whatever it is in the movie. Oh, a car from Bullet.
[48:56.060 --> 49:02.120]  I mean, I don't want to sound way too nerdy, but like, wouldn't a TARDIS be like the perfect thing
[49:02.120 --> 49:07.940]  to have? It's the size of a... It doesn't really move much. Yeah, but it's the size of a, it moves
[49:07.940 --> 49:11.740]  wherever you want to go. It goes anywhere in the universe forward and back. But Andrew said it has
[49:11.740 --> 49:16.820]  to be functional. Has to be functional, has to work. Unless you stick some wheels underneath it.
[49:17.520 --> 49:22.760]  Well, you're saying it works as intended in the movie. So I assume in my world, then I walk in
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.940]  with a, it's a 4,000 square foot house on the inside, which is lovely. In Austin, good luck
[49:28.940 --> 49:32.980]  finding that. So you just plunk it down anywhere and then I can go anywhere in the observable
[49:32.980 --> 49:38.440]  universe. Yeah, I took it as, Eric says, I took it as magic exists in this scenario. Absolutely,
[49:38.600 --> 49:43.180]  I did. And I don't think it's magic in Doctor Who, I think it's science. Sure. What would you go with,
[49:43.300 --> 49:50.000]  Gavin? Hmm. Um, well, I mean, if we're using magic, I want one of the light bikes from Tron.
[49:50.320 --> 49:55.740]  Well, that's also not magic, that's science. I mean, it's not, is it? Hard light?
[49:56.860 --> 50:00.120]  Eric's going to change his fucking answer. I just like the idea of going,
[50:00.420 --> 50:02.980]  like, riding down the motorway and no one can come behind me.
[50:05.140 --> 50:07.180]  Like no one can tailgate you ever? Yeah.
[50:08.440 --> 50:15.300]  I, hmm, we're going different. I'm thinking, like, the submarine from the Hunt for Red October,
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.700]  because I just, I don't know anyone that owns a submarine. Is it a real submarine? I assume,
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.560]  well, no, I'm saying, like, but it's depicted. You just fucking picked the Tron bike. What are
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.040]  you talking about? I thought we were talking about props, but then Geoff picked the TARDIS,
[50:28.140 --> 50:32.800]  which is an empty wooden box. It's full of stuff on the inside.
[50:34.580 --> 50:38.800]  I think owning a submarine would be fun. And I don't know anyone who has a submarine.
[50:40.140 --> 50:43.920]  That'd be, it'd be a great show. It'd be like, oh, look at what I just bought. And it's just water.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.380]  And then you're like, pull it up. If we're picking submarines, I want the one from
[50:48.380 --> 50:53.240]  Goldmember that's shaped like Dr. Evil. Oh, that's great.
[50:55.120 --> 51:00.040]  Imagine if that was functional. Imagine if they really built a whole submarine for Goldmember.
[51:00.680 --> 51:06.460]  I want, I want to change my answer. I want the spaceship that they built in the Explorers out
[51:06.460 --> 51:09.980]  of trash cans that actually took them to space. Did you guys ever see that movie when you were
[51:09.980 --> 51:15.580]  kids? River Phoenix and... Wars? Yeah. No. Eric has a problem with our scenario.
[51:15.580 --> 51:21.100]  It just, it went from what's a cool car that you think is in a movie or something to
[51:22.040 --> 51:29.760]  what insane sci-fi thing do you want? Like, this is so, man, it really went in a direction I was
[51:29.760 --> 51:39.260]  not anticipating. I want the tuxedo from Tuxedo. That's my pick. Oh, it's Ethan Hawke and River
[51:39.260 --> 51:44.960]  Phoenix. Yeah. And this is what the spaceship looked like. I would rather, I would rather
[51:44.960 --> 51:49.980]  fucking fly in the Magnum P.I. Chopper with the doors open than take foot in that thing. I don't
[51:49.980 --> 51:53.100]  want to get in that thing. Oh, you know what? I would take... That looks so insecure. I would
[51:53.100 --> 51:59.920]  take the Winnebago from Spaceballs. Oh, that's good. Because that at least has wheels. That is
[51:59.920 --> 52:05.740]  good. And could potentially function on a real road if it wasn't, I assume, about a foot long
[52:05.740 --> 52:11.960]  in real life. I want the car from Spy Hunter. Can we go video game? Yeah, of course. Yeah,
[52:11.960 --> 52:17.160]  The Rock. That's a weird video. They made the second Spy Hunter. I don't remember what the
[52:17.160 --> 52:21.960]  subtitle is, but there's a second Spy Hunter that The Rock was in and they were going to make a
[52:21.960 --> 52:26.140]  movie based off of the game, but then the game wasn't successful enough to justify the movie.
[52:26.260 --> 52:31.320]  So it's like this weird movie time game that doesn't have a movie associated with it. Huh.
[52:32.720 --> 52:37.100]  Very strange. It's one of like early Rock. It's like before even I want to say he did The Rundown.
[52:37.100 --> 52:43.460]  Like it is very early Rock work. I forgot about The Rundown. Rundown is maybe my favorite Rock
[52:43.460 --> 52:47.440]  movie. It's a good movie. I mean, awesome. Is that the one with Johnny Knoxville in it?
[52:48.300 --> 52:54.580]  No, that's Walk Tall. Walk Tall. Yeah. Yeah. No, The Rundown has Sean William Scott and
[52:54.580 --> 53:01.440]  right. Right, right, right, right. Rosario Dawson shot on a hill. It's great. Christopher
[53:01.440 --> 53:05.400]  Walken has the whole monologue in that movie about Oompa Loompas, but he didn't know what they were
[53:05.400 --> 53:09.260]  when they filmed it. So like he complained about the he's like, what the fuck is this?
[53:09.500 --> 53:15.320]  And they had to explain to him what an Oompa Loompa is. Fantastic. It's a great action movie.
[53:16.180 --> 53:19.140]  Fuck the long kiss goodnight. Watch The Rundown. If you want a dumb action movie,
[53:19.660 --> 53:23.320]  Rundown is awesome. Yeah, I haven't seen it. It is a good movie. Not that there's a lot of
[53:23.320 --> 53:29.600]  competition. It's the best WWE movie of all time by a lot. It's a low bar, but it's very good.
[53:29.600 --> 53:38.140]  I am. Yes, I hate to say it, but I have sock dilemma. Oh, no, we can't do this again.
[53:38.340 --> 53:43.120]  Gavin, Gavin, really fucking time travel pod. You've come to the right place. How can we help?
[53:43.200 --> 53:47.720]  Yeah, I figure this is the correct support group for the problem, but I really am annoyed that I
[53:48.760 --> 53:56.340]  wait. What say without knowing it? We in the same episode, we literally flip the coin
[53:56.340 --> 54:01.900]  and are now doing a sock story. We had an actual coin flip and a sock story.
[54:03.460 --> 54:07.280]  This is stupid. Sorry, go ahead. I just have to point that out.
[54:09.420 --> 54:13.400]  We've done this before. What is happening with your socks?
[54:15.640 --> 54:21.700]  So I bought some new socks. I bought a three pack of this type of like more breathable sock
[54:22.380 --> 54:28.080]  just because it's hot. I wanted a summer sock. And I put on this new type of sock that I've
[54:28.080 --> 54:34.760]  never worn before, and it was phenomenal. I really enjoyed putting it on, like it went on well,
[54:34.920 --> 54:39.480]  it feels nice to walk around the house, feels good in a shoe. I thought, this is a great sock.
[54:40.380 --> 54:45.840]  I'm going to buy a ten pack of these socks. And it got to the point where while I was waiting for
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.800]  these socks to arrive, occasionally these new socks would be in the rotation. Like I'd go back
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.660]  and forth between a new, nice, fresh sock and then my old socks. And it got to the point where I was
[54:56.660 --> 55:03.640]  like, I always have a good day when I wear a nice new pair of socks. And it was getting to the
[55:03.640 --> 55:07.780]  point where I'd like, I'd have an okay day or a shit day on the old socks. And every time I'd
[55:07.780 --> 55:13.020]  wear a new one, it was great. And then the ten pack came and this continued. I was like, wow,
[55:13.020 --> 55:17.800]  I pretty much, and this is, it was subconscious at first, but it actually got to the point where
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.820]  I was like, well, I need today to go well, so I'm going to put on one of the new pairs.
[55:22.200 --> 55:27.620]  And this has continued to work probably for the last three or four weeks. Until last week,
[55:27.740 --> 55:34.120]  I put on a new pair and had a shit day. And I thought, uh-oh. And then I started to try and
[55:34.120 --> 55:39.240]  analyze it, like, is it because it was red? Like, I still, I'm just in a weird, it's like,
[55:39.240 --> 55:43.660]  it's so subconscious. Like, it's not a real decision I'm making, but now I'm avoiding
[55:44.180 --> 55:49.220]  the red ones. And I've just, I think I've just become, I've become everything I was making fun
[55:49.220 --> 55:55.960]  of when it came to Jen, because socks don't matter. It's all bollocks. It's all superstition
[55:55.960 --> 56:02.620]  crap. But I have a bad day when I wear the red good sock. But you used to have a good day when
[56:02.620 --> 56:07.040]  you wore the red good sock, right? I just used to not notice. But now that I haven't had a bad day
[56:07.040 --> 56:10.780]  with these socks, I'm, I'm actually picking up that pair of socks every day and putting them
[56:10.780 --> 56:16.340]  back. Do you know what you need to do? Honestly, you need to get rid of that pair of socks. You
[56:16.340 --> 56:20.980]  used up the good in those socks. All the luck is gone. You think I should just bin it? It was
[56:20.980 --> 56:26.700]  like a $14 pair of socks. It'll never be good for you again. You're never going to enjoy them. You
[56:26.700 --> 56:30.160]  don't recharge socks. That's what I've been thinking. I'm like, do I just avoid this pair
[56:30.160 --> 56:35.460]  of socks? Or do I try and cleanse the socks by basically picking like a day where I would go
[56:35.460 --> 56:42.060]  to Disneyland or it's like, you couldn't lose the day and put on the good socks. Like a guaranteed.
[56:44.760 --> 56:50.100]  What do you have? Oh, I don't know. I just feel like if there's a day where up front,
[56:50.140 --> 56:54.200]  you know, it's going to be an absolute corker. Do I put on the bad socks and potentially
[56:54.200 --> 57:00.140]  tarnish the day? Or do I cleanse the socks of evil? Your entire belief that it's impossible
[57:00.140 --> 57:04.060]  to have a good day with the socks on. Like, I don't think your logic doesn't make sense.
[57:04.060 --> 57:07.280]  Yeah, I don't know how any of this works. I was hoping that you guys would have suggestions.
[57:07.660 --> 57:09.940]  That's difficult. It's like which came first, chicken or the egg, right?
[57:10.380 --> 57:17.600]  Like, is the power, is the negativity of the sock, does it outweigh the power of a guaranteed good
[57:17.600 --> 57:25.640]  day? That's a dangerous stuff you're dealing with here. I mean, it's 14 fucking dollars.
[57:27.060 --> 57:29.540]  You can donate them. Yeah, donate them, man.
[57:30.520 --> 57:33.740]  Who wants a used pair of socks? A lot of people.
[57:34.540 --> 57:37.380]  Yeah, you can donate clothes. Yeah, a lot of people could use especially a pair of socks
[57:37.380 --> 57:40.600]  like this. I think socks and undies were out of the question for donation.
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.900]  Oh, I don't know. Are they? I don't know. I just feel like socks would be fine.
[57:45.240 --> 57:49.880]  I mean, is a good day worth more to you than $14? I guess so.
[57:50.420 --> 57:55.880]  Would you pay $14 to avoid a really shit day? I would.
[57:56.860 --> 58:00.540]  I think I would too. That's a good point. Yeah, I would probably get rid of those socks.
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.380]  They're never, they're only going to hurt you. Unless we come up with like a uniform
[58:04.380 --> 58:08.660]  cleanse bag or something. Listen, now there is, that's a possibility
[58:08.660 --> 58:12.180]  too. I like the idea of trying to reach, I know I just said it was impossible, but
[58:13.120 --> 58:19.320]  I don't think anything's really impossible. Is there a way to like re-imbue these socks
[58:19.320 --> 58:24.540]  with good sock luck? I have no idea. I wouldn't even know how to begin that.
[58:25.260 --> 58:30.640]  I'd be open to suggestions from the audience. And I also think it's, I just enjoy it because I'm
[58:31.840 --> 58:37.060]  about as skeptic as they come with all that nonsense and like healing and astrology and
[58:37.060 --> 58:42.500]  all that shite. I like the idea that I'm now pushing for one of those items to be made.
[58:42.560 --> 58:49.720]  Knowing you, when you said, so then I had, I wore them and I had a bad day.
[58:49.720 --> 58:55.420]  I expected you to be like, and that ended that bullshit fantasy thing that I'd been living in.
[58:55.540 --> 58:58.520]  And instead you pivoted and said, and that's why I've stopped wearing red.
[58:58.860 --> 59:04.560]  Well, here's the thing, I didn't want to write off the entire pack of socks.
[59:05.980 --> 59:09.780]  I spend good money on those socks. I don't want to be like, well, they're all tarnished.
[59:10.180 --> 59:16.680]  Is it possible? Is it possible it's a month thing? Like maybe they're good luck in May,
[59:16.680 --> 59:21.100]  but bad luck in June. That's a great angle.
[59:21.460 --> 59:23.980]  All completely irrelevant. I don't know.
[59:24.120 --> 59:26.600]  I don't know. Maybe it matters how many days are in the month.
[59:27.260 --> 59:32.340]  Yeah. Or like, is it an even day or an odd day? There's a lot of magics associated with that.
[59:32.420 --> 59:36.220]  Yeah. You could really go at it. I think the only way to truly find out is to keep a spreadsheet
[59:36.220 --> 59:40.320]  and probably do it for a year and then do like a cross-reference and analysis.
[59:41.120 --> 59:41.400]  Yeah.
[59:41.760 --> 59:43.880]  I want to know if Eric has any thoughts on the sock matter.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.520]  What you just described is something Gus would do unprovoked.
[59:49.540 --> 59:56.440]  Yeah, but he gets off sexually at that stuff.
[59:56.540 --> 01:00:01.340]  I nearly fainted at the start of your story when you said that I got a three pack of socks,
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.880]  and I thought you meant you bought three socks in one pack. I thought it was like,
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.680]  we're really tight now. It's all connecting. This is truly a rerun.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.540]  No, it was six individual socks.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:16.600]  I was stunned when you said I got a three pack, and I was like, what is going on
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.940]  internally? I'm still recovering from that moment.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.640]  What if you... is Dan around?
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:24.940]  Not this week.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.840]  He'll do anything, right? What if you made him wear the socks for a day and then observe the
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.780]  quality of his day?
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.180]  And then just give him a survey at the end of the day, just like, how was your day?
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:40.040]  So how was your day? And if it was a good day or a bad day, and then that way you outsource
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.380]  the danger to him.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.100]  Should I feel bad if he has an awful day, though? I feel like I'd be the cause.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.620]  Do you... do you give a shit?
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.960]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.040]  Now, I don't think you do. You took too long to answer.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.440]  You had to convince yourself that you cared in front of other people.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.200]  No, that was like, the pause said everything. I appreciate the attempt.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.380]  You answered us way before you answered.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.140]  Well, hey, I didn't even... let me try that again.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.740]  Well, hey, you've gone to listen to a whole other episode of the F*** Face Podcast with
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.380]  Geoff and Andrew and Gavin.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.280]  And I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.860]  I sure had a good time running through the past, doing this rerun with you on this time
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.700]  travel podcast.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.540]  Be sure to watch the Long Kiss Goodnight or not.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.940]  Maybe you should watch the rundown.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.300]  Let me throw the Explorers in the ring.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.840]  And if you thought my voice sounded weird, I agree.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.440]  It's because I got braces today and my mouth feels all f***ed up.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.100]  Well, like Invisalign.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.740]  I got Invisalign today.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:47.440]  Okay.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.240]  What an insane thing to drop right at the end, Geoff.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.500]  That's f***ing... what... that's crazy.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.340]  He dropped it at the beginning, but none of us asked about it.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:56.680]  I realized.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.840]  We'll see you next week.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.540]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.520]  Can you beat the bread clip challenge?
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.100]  Gavin's a chain guy.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.760]  Ranston comes to pizza.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.080]  Gavin made a baseball video and no one cared.
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.960]  Andrew wants to be the king of England.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.400]  It's the royal wee.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.220]  Is Gavin a time traveler?
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.600]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.660]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
