[00:15.290 --> 00:17.230]  There's not enough weird athletes.
[00:17.530 --> 00:19.190]  I agree. Zach Granke is it.
[00:19.470 --> 00:20.830]  We have Zach Granke and that's it.
[00:21.090 --> 00:23.470]  Zach Granke is the weird guy and that's all we have.
[00:23.550 --> 00:25.170]  And it sucks. We need more weird athletes.
[00:25.230 --> 00:26.390]  Who is Zach Granke?
[00:26.750 --> 00:29.130]  He's a pitcher. He used to pit...
[00:29.130 --> 00:30.430]  Well, he's back on the Royals now.
[00:30.750 --> 00:33.390]  But I guess the most recent thing that he did
[00:33.390 --> 00:35.830]  where you could qualify him as weird guy
[00:36.430 --> 00:40.350]  is a fan was trying to get autographs.
[00:40.770 --> 00:41.810]  Handed him a bunch of autographs.
[00:41.810 --> 00:42.850]  He took a baseball to sign.
[00:43.310 --> 00:44.570]  Because he was signing autographs.
[00:44.830 --> 00:46.630]  He took the baseball, turned around,
[00:46.810 --> 00:48.510]  and threw it as far as he could.
[00:49.370 --> 00:50.430]  Just away from them.
[00:50.770 --> 00:52.570]  And the fan said, why did you do that?
[00:52.670 --> 00:54.170]  And he said, for my amusement.
[00:56.550 --> 00:57.870]  And it's weird because
[00:57.870 --> 00:58.950]  with social media
[00:58.950 --> 01:01.510]  you would think you would have more access
[01:01.510 --> 01:03.530]  than ever to the weirdness of athletes.
[01:03.650 --> 01:05.490]  But it's like this unfortunate mix of
[01:05.490 --> 01:08.050]  they got publicists at the same time.
[01:08.150 --> 01:10.170]  They worked out agents and all that shit.
[01:11.030 --> 01:12.590]  There's a team of four people
[01:12.590 --> 01:13.950]  in front of you and your mouth
[01:13.950 --> 01:14.990]  at all times now.
[01:15.430 --> 01:18.510]  Zach Granke is my favorite professional athlete
[01:19.370 --> 01:20.310]  just because of
[01:20.310 --> 01:22.070]  the insane stories about Zach Granke.
[01:22.230 --> 01:24.130]  He's the fucking best. I love him.
[01:24.610 --> 01:26.150]  Gavin, you can...
[01:26.150 --> 01:28.230]  This is episode 112, so you can take it
[01:28.230 --> 01:28.750]  from here, Gavin.
[01:29.210 --> 01:31.650]  Nice of you to show up, Eric. Appreciate it.
[01:33.330 --> 01:34.710]  Alright, well, Gavin's in a mood.
[01:34.910 --> 01:35.570]  Uh-huh, yep.
[01:35.750 --> 01:36.690]  Everything going okay, buddy?
[01:38.050 --> 01:39.270]  Oh, do we not
[01:39.270 --> 01:40.510]  rip on Eric?
[01:41.950 --> 01:43.110]  No, I mean,
[01:43.130 --> 01:45.090]  we do. It's just the tone
[01:45.090 --> 01:46.070]  was a little off, Gavin.
[01:46.570 --> 01:48.990]  We shit on Eric. We shit into Eric's open
[01:48.990 --> 01:50.010]  mouth whenever we can.
[01:51.210 --> 01:52.810]  You seem to be dispossessed
[01:53.290 --> 01:54.550]  of a level of energy.
[01:54.930 --> 01:56.250]  It's just a delivery problem.
[01:56.730 --> 01:58.790]  No, yeah, it was very, like, a
[01:58.790 --> 02:00.990]  serious, like, you're actually upset.
[02:01.310 --> 02:03.130]  I often... Geoff, you gaslight
[02:03.130 --> 02:05.310]  Gavin all the time with asking if he's okay.
[02:05.310 --> 02:07.390]  That might be the first legitimate
[02:07.390 --> 02:09.270]  needed, are you okay, that we've ever
[02:09.270 --> 02:11.410]  had on the show. Are you okay,
[02:11.490 --> 02:13.170]  Gavin? No, I'm good. I just
[02:13.170 --> 02:15.310]  thought I was doing it right. I need to work on it, obviously.
[02:15.570 --> 02:16.790]  But, uh, apologies, Eric.
[02:17.050 --> 02:18.110]  That was, uh...
[02:18.730 --> 02:19.590]  Didn't land right.
[02:22.010 --> 02:22.370]  I...
[02:24.530 --> 02:25.370]  I got what
[02:25.370 --> 02:27.370]  you were going for, but I appreciate people
[02:27.370 --> 02:29.370]  sticking up for me, so thank you very much.
[02:30.810 --> 02:31.370]  It's just,
[02:31.430 --> 02:33.210]  it was weird, because I don't feel like you were
[02:33.210 --> 02:35.210]  gone. You missed the last one.
[02:35.330 --> 02:37.430]  I think you were there the one before, though.
[02:37.930 --> 02:39.110]  Yeah, he missed, he missed, like, one.
[02:39.230 --> 02:41.390]  I really had nothing. Yeah, it was a really...
[02:41.390 --> 02:42.870]  It was a strange call-out.
[02:43.610 --> 02:45.150]  I think I understood what you were going for.
[02:45.170 --> 02:47.190]  It was just a mix. It was a lot of... Would you like to go again?
[02:47.330 --> 02:48.050]  Would you like to try it again?
[02:49.170 --> 02:50.950]  I'll try next week. Okay.
[02:51.250 --> 02:52.510]  But he's gonna be here.
[02:52.890 --> 02:54.030]  Yeah, whatever. Dude.
[02:54.790 --> 02:57.270]  Are you gonna be here for the second recording today, Eric?
[02:57.530 --> 02:59.090]  Yes, I will be here for the second recording.
[02:59.090 --> 03:01.170]  Alright, Gavin. I can step out
[03:01.170 --> 03:02.070]  if you want me to.
[03:02.770 --> 03:05.130]  Gavin, get yourself ready.
[03:05.250 --> 03:06.890]  We're gonna record this back-to-back, so you can
[03:06.890 --> 03:08.990]  shit right on him in about 48 minutes.
[03:09.530 --> 03:11.210]  Yeah, and if you're listening
[03:11.210 --> 03:12.490]  to this because you're a fan,
[03:12.990 --> 03:15.070]  come see us in one week to hear how
[03:15.070 --> 03:16.670]  Gavin really gets me.
[03:22.710 --> 03:24.970]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the
[03:24.970 --> 03:27.130]  F*** Face Podcast, a podcast where
[03:27.130 --> 03:28.730]  we get each other.
[03:28.730 --> 03:30.930]  And we tend to do it
[03:30.930 --> 03:32.310]  with a little more energy than Gavin today.
[03:32.730 --> 03:34.510]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always,
[03:34.610 --> 03:36.770]  Andrew Panton and the aforementioned
[03:36.770 --> 03:38.390]  Gavin Free. I believe
[03:38.390 --> 03:40.850]  this is episode 112. Is that correct?
[03:41.110 --> 03:41.710]  That is correct.
[03:42.070 --> 03:44.170]  Episode 112 of
[03:44.810 --> 03:46.770]  Season 4, Year 3,
[03:48.370 --> 03:49.250]  Volume 1.
[03:49.810 --> 03:50.490]  Chapter whatever.
[03:51.230 --> 03:51.830]  How are you guys doing?
[03:52.890 --> 03:54.810]  I'm great. I'm excited. It's been a while, hasn't it?
[03:54.870 --> 03:55.850]  I know. Andrew's excited.
[03:55.850 --> 03:57.990]  Yeah, I need to talk
[03:57.990 --> 03:58.990]  to you guys about something.
[03:59.670 --> 04:01.050]  I'm very curious about.
[04:01.630 --> 04:03.950]  No, I haven't done any. Well, I did
[04:03.950 --> 04:06.050]  something in the past. It's just the reaction to it
[04:06.050 --> 04:07.710]  and the lack of reaction
[04:07.710 --> 04:09.910]  here. I made a
[04:09.910 --> 04:12.010]  complete ass of myself
[04:12.010 --> 04:13.050]  two weeks ago.
[04:13.410 --> 04:15.770]  Is it two weeks ago now? And there was
[04:15.770 --> 04:17.970]  zero. I'm so curious
[04:17.970 --> 04:19.910]  if you guys noticed what
[04:19.910 --> 04:21.770]  happened and you didn't address it
[04:21.770 --> 04:23.910]  or if you missed it as well.
[04:23.910 --> 04:25.930]  Do you get what I'm
[04:25.930 --> 04:27.930]  talking about? I think
[04:27.930 --> 04:30.030]  you may be talking about a cove.
[04:30.370 --> 04:32.070]  Yeah, I sure
[04:32.070 --> 04:32.530]  am.
[04:34.070 --> 04:35.750]  So I had
[04:35.750 --> 04:38.010]  zero awareness that I fucked that up.
[04:38.970 --> 04:39.830]  And it was an
[04:39.830 --> 04:41.870]  incredible... Let me just
[04:41.870 --> 04:43.890]  say the sentence as I said it
[04:43.890 --> 04:45.790]  because it is a masterworks
[04:45.790 --> 04:46.630]  in stupidity.
[04:48.350 --> 04:49.910]  Jake is an endless
[04:49.910 --> 04:51.710]  treasure cove of words
[04:51.710 --> 04:53.350]  that are slightly wrong
[04:53.350 --> 04:55.710]  was the sentence I said. I know
[04:55.710 --> 04:57.650]  it's true. I could... I stepped
[04:57.650 --> 04:59.770]  in a shovel so hard while
[04:59.770 --> 05:01.870]  laughing at somebody else. You couldn't
[05:01.870 --> 05:03.710]  have scripted a better foot
[05:03.710 --> 05:05.290]  in mouth than that, dude.
[05:05.550 --> 05:07.290]  I wish I could claim credit.
[05:07.590 --> 05:09.650]  That's comedic genius if I purposely
[05:09.650 --> 05:11.550]  did that. I'm just an idiot
[05:11.550 --> 05:13.650]  and I had no idea that happened
[05:13.650 --> 05:15.450]  and you guys didn't react to it
[05:15.450 --> 05:17.710]  at all. So when the episode came
[05:17.710 --> 05:19.650]  out, I don't listen to the show but I look at
[05:19.650 --> 05:21.730]  the comments and there were... It was almost
[05:21.730 --> 05:23.690]  all talks about a treasure cove
[05:23.690 --> 05:25.770]  and I was like, what is... What treasure cove?
[05:25.870 --> 05:27.830]  Like that... It gives me very mini-golf
[05:27.830 --> 05:29.710]  vibes when I hear treasure cove. I was like
[05:29.710 --> 05:32.110]  we didn't talk about mini-golf. Dude, I don't...
[05:32.110 --> 05:33.650]  I want a vacation in
[05:33.650 --> 05:34.430]  treasure cove.
[05:36.250 --> 05:37.350]  I think it sounded
[05:37.350 --> 05:38.690]  wrong to me but
[05:39.250 --> 05:41.510]  it didn't register that clearly I guess
[05:41.510 --> 05:43.590]  just because it could be a Canadian thing or a
[05:43.590 --> 05:45.310]  North American thing and I was just like, well
[05:45.310 --> 05:47.210]  it seems like he knows what he's talking about.
[05:47.210 --> 05:49.010]  Like it could
[05:49.010 --> 05:50.690]  technically be correct.
[05:50.970 --> 05:53.210]  Like a treasure... Like a cove of treasure...
[05:54.230 --> 05:55.210]  There's... No, there's no way
[05:55.210 --> 05:57.170]  to dig out of that. It's wrong. No, it's
[05:57.170 --> 05:59.190]  totally wrong. I'm not saying it's right. I'm a fucking idiot.
[05:59.310 --> 06:01.150]  I fucked it up completely. But I'm
[06:01.150 --> 06:03.310]  saying as far as challenging it goes. I can see
[06:03.310 --> 06:05.290]  there being a little bit of resistance like for a half
[06:05.290 --> 06:07.050]  second. But...
[06:07.050 --> 06:09.090]  So I was curious, did you... So Gavin
[06:09.090 --> 06:11.070]  and Geoff, did you notice that? When it happened?
[06:11.070 --> 06:13.270]  Not at all. No. I think the thing that
[06:13.990 --> 06:15.050]  that... And I recognize
[06:15.050 --> 06:16.950]  the audience feels like we should have noticed
[06:16.950 --> 06:18.970]  and going back and listening to it, it's pretty
[06:18.970 --> 06:20.950]  fucking like pretty clear.
[06:21.430 --> 06:23.010]  Sure. But I think the thing that
[06:23.010 --> 06:25.170]  gets missed is
[06:25.170 --> 06:26.850]  that when we're doing the show
[06:26.850 --> 06:29.030]  like I'm kind of... I don't know about you guys, but
[06:29.030 --> 06:31.430]  I'm like giving you guys like 65%
[06:31.430 --> 06:32.890]  of my attention and then the other
[06:32.890 --> 06:35.030]  35% I'm planning like a bit
[06:35.030 --> 06:36.930]  or what I'm going to say or how to work something in.
[06:37.150 --> 06:39.030]  So it's easy to miss stuff in the moment like
[06:39.030 --> 06:40.890]  that. I try and listen with a higher
[06:40.890 --> 06:42.770]  percentage than that. I try to be
[06:42.770 --> 06:45.000]  like maybe a 90%
[06:45.290 --> 06:46.590]  but some stuff does slip through.
[06:46.910 --> 06:48.590]  That's too high. For sure. That's far too high.
[06:50.550 --> 06:52.810]  Was it always 65%, Geoff? Or is this
[06:52.810 --> 06:54.030]  a sliding scale?
[06:54.650 --> 06:56.410]  Oh, it's definitely a sliding scale.
[06:56.710 --> 06:58.770]  As the episode number
[06:58.770 --> 07:00.970]  goes up, the percentage goes down.
[07:01.530 --> 07:02.670]  Yeah. Year 4,
[07:02.790 --> 07:04.490]  Geoff, or year 3, Geoff, is
[07:04.490 --> 07:05.930]  a lot different than year 1, Geoff.
[07:06.950 --> 07:08.910]  Is it... I'm guessing less? It's continuously
[07:08.910 --> 07:11.090]  going down? By sliding scale
[07:11.090 --> 07:13.030]  it's not going back and forth, it's just
[07:13.030 --> 07:15.050]  down. It is sliding downwards with time.
[07:15.090 --> 07:17.050]  I mean, I feel like I tell you guys all the
[07:17.050 --> 07:19.350]  time when I'm like, I'm sorry, I tuned out.
[07:19.670 --> 07:20.330]  I wasn't paying attention.
[07:20.890 --> 07:23.090]  I feel like in the last episode
[07:23.090 --> 07:25.110]  I was listening to it back and there was
[07:25.110 --> 07:27.130]  a period in the last episode where my headphones
[07:27.130 --> 07:29.230]  turned off for like 2 straight minutes
[07:29.230 --> 07:30.950]  and Andrew, you said something
[07:30.950 --> 07:33.010]  really funny during that period where you
[07:33.010 --> 07:35.230]  said that you flipped your phone
[07:35.230 --> 07:37.050]  around to look at the back of the car.
[07:37.150 --> 07:39.030]  I thought that was really funny. But I do
[07:39.030 --> 07:41.210]  feel like maybe that fell in Geoff's
[07:41.210 --> 07:42.890]  35% of not paying attention
[07:42.890 --> 07:44.970]  because there was literally no reaction to that
[07:44.970 --> 07:46.310]  at all. But I thought that was very funny.
[07:46.930 --> 07:48.990]  I'll be honest, I wasn't just listening to what you said,
[07:49.070 --> 07:50.850]  Kevin. What was I doing 35% of?
[07:51.910 --> 07:52.930]  You want to wait? You want to do this
[07:52.930 --> 07:53.450]  another time?
[07:57.350 --> 07:58.910]  That was in response to you!
[07:59.350 --> 08:00.730]  Oh. We'll do it again.
[08:01.310 --> 08:01.630]  No!
[08:03.430 --> 08:04.990]  I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, no worries.
[08:05.050 --> 08:06.970]  I'll go back and listen to that part of the podcast when it comes out.
[08:06.970 --> 08:08.790]  But only that part.
[08:11.150 --> 08:12.110]  I was...
[08:12.110 --> 08:14.150]  there was some Cosmic Crisp
[08:14.850 --> 08:17.010]  stuff we could talk about later.
[08:17.490 --> 08:18.590]  You were...
[08:18.590 --> 08:20.530]  You were annoyed
[08:20.530 --> 08:22.130]  when I talked to you the other day.
[08:22.250 --> 08:25.030]  I was annoyed, but before we did this, I wanted to
[08:25.030 --> 08:27.110]  check to see how we all
[08:27.110 --> 08:28.510]  rated the Apple at that time.
[08:28.590 --> 08:30.890]  I didn't get to try it in the actual review.
[08:31.490 --> 08:33.050]  So I wanted to listen
[08:33.050 --> 08:34.350]  to it. I played it back again.
[08:34.350 --> 08:36.150]  An all-time not listening moment.
[08:36.270 --> 08:37.430]  I forgot that this happened.
[08:37.790 --> 08:39.530]  Geoff, you set up what we're going to do.
[08:39.870 --> 08:42.290]  We've all had the Apple, or all you guys did.
[08:42.610 --> 08:43.590]  And now we're going to do it.
[08:43.610 --> 08:45.650]  We're going to do it on a scale of 1-10.
[08:45.770 --> 08:47.110]  10 being the best Apple ever.
[08:48.250 --> 08:50.310]  Gavin, you go first. What would you rate the Apple?
[08:50.630 --> 08:51.810]  And Gavin immediately says,
[08:51.890 --> 08:54.330]  What's the scale? Wasn't listening at all.
[08:54.870 --> 08:55.610]  It's a great...
[08:55.610 --> 08:57.770]  There's an established history
[08:58.250 --> 09:00.090]  of not listening and missing
[09:00.090 --> 09:01.230]  the complete setup
[09:01.230 --> 09:03.470]  to what is currently happening.
[09:03.850 --> 09:05.270]  It's one of those things
[09:05.270 --> 09:07.490]  where you think, because you're a part of the process,
[09:07.730 --> 09:08.590]  you think you know
[09:09.130 --> 09:11.350]  the spiel, so you're not really listening to the spiel.
[09:11.530 --> 09:13.330]  And it's like, and what do you think of this
[09:13.330 --> 09:14.510]  goat? And it's like, wait, what?
[09:14.730 --> 09:17.190]  And you just realize that you're not as tuned in as you think.
[09:17.750 --> 09:19.250]  This is perfect, because it was literally
[09:19.690 --> 09:21.190]  60 seconds of detailing
[09:21.190 --> 09:23.150]  the specifics of the scale, and then
[09:23.150 --> 09:24.890]  you immediately ask it, well, what's the scale?
[09:25.210 --> 09:25.850]  Very genuinely.
[09:26.770 --> 09:29.270]  Do we want to talk about the Cosmic Crisp
[09:29.950 --> 09:31.070]  situation that has happened?
[09:31.470 --> 09:32.230]  What's the situation?
[09:34.510 --> 09:35.230]  Real fast,
[09:35.330 --> 09:36.570]  let's circle the wagons before we do that.
[09:36.730 --> 09:38.590]  Because we're going to do two episodes.
[09:38.890 --> 09:40.790]  I have a lot of notes, but
[09:40.790 --> 09:42.510]  none of them are particularly important.
[09:42.830 --> 09:45.230]  Although I feel like there are two things I should at least mention,
[09:45.350 --> 09:46.710]  but I don't even have to get to them this episode.
[09:47.050 --> 09:49.170]  Gavin, I remember you said last episode
[09:49.170 --> 09:51.070]  you had like seven or eight things to talk about
[09:51.070 --> 09:52.130]  and you only got to one.
[09:53.050 --> 09:55.450]  Andrew, I assume you have a bunch too outside of Cosmic Crisp?
[09:55.930 --> 09:56.890]  I have a little bit, yeah.
[09:56.890 --> 09:58.510]  Nothing I'd say is essential.
[09:58.890 --> 10:00.470]  Well, let's just dive in with Cosmic Crisp.
[10:00.810 --> 10:01.230]  Okay.
[10:02.710 --> 10:05.230]  I got a notification. I was very excited.
[10:05.690 --> 10:06.770]  We've tried in the past,
[10:07.090 --> 10:08.250]  but for the first time,
[10:08.910 --> 10:10.810]  Cosmic Crisp has interacted with us
[10:10.810 --> 10:12.570]  on Twitter in some capacity.
[10:13.570 --> 10:14.910]  Somebody is doing
[10:14.910 --> 10:16.830]  the test of having
[10:16.830 --> 10:18.730]  one of their apples just out
[10:18.730 --> 10:20.770]  and seeing how it has lasted throughout
[10:20.770 --> 10:23.250]  these months. And so they did like a collage
[10:23.250 --> 10:25.050]  of this is like the start,
[10:25.050 --> 10:27.270]  month two, month four, month six.
[10:28.330 --> 10:29.690]  I'll go ahead and pay attention now.
[10:29.870 --> 10:32.090]  Okay, that was wrong.
[10:32.430 --> 10:33.870]  That was just fucked up by me.
[10:34.710 --> 10:35.870]  What is a collage?
[10:36.250 --> 10:39.010]  If they took a bunch of pictures
[10:39.010 --> 10:41.070]  and then sort of cut them all out and stuck them to the same
[10:41.070 --> 10:42.150]  piece of cardboard, wouldn't it?
[10:42.410 --> 10:42.630]  Yeah.
[10:44.630 --> 10:45.790]  And what was the other word?
[10:46.630 --> 10:47.030]  Montage.
[10:48.970 --> 10:50.150]  Is a montage...
[10:50.150 --> 10:52.410]  A montage can be a stationary image?
[10:52.410 --> 10:53.670]  A collection of like four images?
[10:54.070 --> 10:56.070]  It's more of like a progression of time, isn't it?
[10:56.410 --> 10:57.590]  And like a bunch of different stuff.
[10:58.130 --> 11:00.390]  I've just never thought of a photo montage before.
[11:00.590 --> 11:02.290]  But you're totally right. That makes sense.
[11:02.670 --> 11:04.590]  Does that mean a time lapse is a photo montage?
[11:05.550 --> 11:05.850]  Could be.
[11:07.590 --> 11:07.990]  Anyway.
[11:08.930 --> 11:09.890]  Sent these photos
[11:10.430 --> 11:11.830]  and they asked them,
[11:11.870 --> 11:13.270]  are you testing our apples?
[11:13.470 --> 11:16.290]  And then I got in there a little bit and I was so excited because we've tried
[11:16.290 --> 11:18.630]  to interact with them in the past with zero response.
[11:18.990 --> 11:20.250]  Which is understandable considering
[11:20.250 --> 11:21.030]  the name of the show.
[11:22.370 --> 11:24.150]  And it was the first time they interacted.
[11:24.430 --> 11:26.190]  So I commented back to them.
[11:26.330 --> 11:28.250]  They liked it. I got all excited.
[11:28.810 --> 11:30.390]  And then like three hours later
[11:30.390 --> 11:32.750]  I looked at my phone and I got the notification
[11:32.750 --> 11:34.410]  that Cosmic Crisp is now
[11:34.410 --> 11:36.410]  following the F*** Face Pod
[11:36.410 --> 11:37.030]  Twitter account.
[11:37.570 --> 11:40.390]  They only follow like 98 people.
[11:40.550 --> 11:42.110]  At that time it was a very funny list.
[11:43.410 --> 11:43.890]  So...
[11:43.890 --> 11:45.090]  I looked...
[11:46.910 --> 11:48.510]  I looked at who they were
[11:48.510 --> 11:50.290]  following and I was
[11:50.290 --> 11:52.530]  very excited because 98 people. I'm like, oh, this will be
[11:52.530 --> 11:54.790]  a quick thing. How many actual people? Top 100.
[11:54.790 --> 11:56.870]  Yeah, top 100. It's a great way to put it.
[11:57.050 --> 11:58.630]  And it was F*** Face Pod.
[11:59.250 --> 12:00.430]  And then the account they followed
[12:00.430 --> 12:01.670]  after that was Walmart.
[12:02.090 --> 12:04.070]  And then the account they followed after that
[12:04.070 --> 12:06.490]  was Geoff Ramsey. Just Geoff.
[12:07.110 --> 12:08.490]  They just followed
[12:08.490 --> 12:10.750]  Geoff and I was disgusted
[12:10.750 --> 12:12.550]  in the car. I was outraged
[12:12.550 --> 12:14.690]  that out of all the people
[12:14.690 --> 12:16.410]  on this podcast, the
[12:16.410 --> 12:18.250]  Apple company follows the
[12:18.250 --> 12:20.490]  biggest banana guy. Maybe in the
[12:20.490 --> 12:22.170]  world. Number one banana.
[12:22.390 --> 12:24.370]  Apple will never come close to your
[12:24.370 --> 12:26.450]  banana fandom. I will say I feel
[12:26.450 --> 12:28.450]  like I rated the Cosmic Crisp higher than
[12:28.450 --> 12:30.330]  anybody else on this podcast. That's... you did.
[12:30.510 --> 12:32.430]  Which is... well, not me because I didn't have it at
[12:32.430 --> 12:34.410]  that time. But I'm disgusted
[12:34.410 --> 12:36.410]  with you, Geoff, because I went back. That's why I know
[12:36.410 --> 12:38.450]  the Gavin thing because I was going to put it
[12:38.450 --> 12:40.170]  in part of my argument to be like this
[12:40.170 --> 12:42.090]  motherf***er gave it a 4.6
[12:42.090 --> 12:45.130]  and he got the follow. You gave it a 7.8
[12:45.130 --> 12:47.070]  I believe. And you ranked it
[12:47.070 --> 12:48.690]  above the average Apple.
[12:49.230 --> 12:51.210]  I don't remember what you said. You said it was a great
[12:51.210 --> 12:53.270]  Apple, so I couldn't even use that against
[12:53.270 --> 12:55.090]  you. But it was still... I just looked
[12:55.090 --> 12:56.990]  at it in shock that they followed the banana guy.
[12:57.250 --> 12:58.790]  They also follow us on Instagram now.
[12:58.950 --> 13:01.190]  They follow us on Instagram too? Wow.
[13:01.470 --> 13:03.130]  That's awesome. Where were they when we were an Apple
[13:03.130 --> 13:05.050]  podcaster? We're still an Apple
[13:05.050 --> 13:07.290]  podcast. We're a time traveling basement
[13:07.290 --> 13:09.050]  equipment podcast. Wait, basement
[13:09.050 --> 13:09.350]  equipment.
[13:15.630 --> 13:16.470]  We are
[13:17.310 --> 13:18.110]  officially a
[13:18.890 --> 13:20.150]  words f*** up podcast.
[13:21.410 --> 13:22.590]  We're a flub cast.
[13:23.650 --> 13:24.490]  I didn't realize
[13:24.490 --> 13:26.590]  I was having a flubby day until I messed up
[13:26.590 --> 13:27.610]  the beginning of the podcast.
[13:28.510 --> 13:30.630]  Man, I've been able to speak all day.
[13:31.330 --> 13:32.510]  You know what? It wasn't
[13:32.510 --> 13:34.530]  a flub though, the beginning of the podcast.
[13:34.910 --> 13:36.370]  You needed a vibe sommelier
[13:36.370 --> 13:37.970]  to get you to lead in on that.
[13:38.290 --> 13:40.270]  The vibe was off. You know, I don't
[13:40.270 --> 13:42.550]  want to go off in a different direction.
[13:42.670 --> 13:44.470]  I don't want to leave where we are right now, but this brings
[13:44.470 --> 13:46.530]  up a point. You being in a good mood
[13:46.530 --> 13:48.510]  and in a talkative mood today, Gavin. I saw
[13:48.510 --> 13:50.230]  Andrew, let me tell you a little something.
[13:50.490 --> 13:52.290]  I saw Gavin at RT
[13:52.290 --> 13:54.030]  two days ago, I want to say?
[13:54.730 --> 13:56.550]  Or maybe it was even yesterday, I don't remember.
[13:57.090 --> 13:58.470]  I came in to film one
[13:58.470 --> 14:00.410]  quick little thing, and Gavin was there
[14:00.410 --> 14:02.250]  and I said hi to him, and I turned, and
[14:02.250 --> 14:04.410]  the motherf***er left. He didn't hang out, he didn't
[14:04.410 --> 14:06.190]  check on me, he didn't like spend
[14:06.190 --> 14:07.950]  30 seconds. He just left.
[14:08.210 --> 14:10.290]  I left off to work. Just ignored me and left.
[14:10.410 --> 14:12.430]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't, there's a lot of, I feel like
[14:12.430 --> 14:14.190]  I'm lacking context to be on your side.
[14:14.310 --> 14:16.310]  So you said hi, and he said
[14:16.310 --> 14:18.470]  hi. Not really, he was on camera
[14:18.470 --> 14:20.230]  and I walked over and I said hi to the guys
[14:20.230 --> 14:22.370]  and dipped in and just said hello to the camera. And then I
[14:22.370 --> 14:23.530]  walked over and I was hanging out with
[14:24.170 --> 14:26.290]  hanging out with, like, other
[14:26.290 --> 14:28.070]  people from AH in the same room,
[14:28.190 --> 14:30.370]  and then I realized, I was like, oh, I should probably
[14:30.370 --> 14:32.470]  get going at some point. I turned around, Gavin's nowhere to be seen.
[14:32.910 --> 14:33.670]  I had to go to the podcast!
[14:34.270 --> 14:35.950]  I had to be at the podcast by five.
[14:36.590 --> 14:37.630]  Wait, okay. I was running out of time.
[14:37.930 --> 14:40.490]  So you were not in a production, you were just hanging out.
[14:40.490 --> 14:42.310]  You said hi while he was in,
[14:42.490 --> 14:43.390]  he was filming something.
[14:43.570 --> 14:46.550]  I came to do a production, but I couldn't
[14:46.550 --> 14:47.830]  start until his was over.
[14:48.070 --> 14:50.710]  Which wasn't a big deal, I was just kind of hanging out.
[14:50.910 --> 14:52.290]  And I was in no particular hurry,
[14:52.550 --> 14:53.350]  I didn't have anywhere to be.
[14:54.110 --> 14:56.030]  I just wanted to spend time with my friend Gavin,
[14:56.190 --> 14:58.210]  just a few pleasantries in person,
[14:58.810 --> 15:00.050]  because I love him so much.
[15:00.210 --> 15:01.370]  And then he jacked me.
[15:01.890 --> 15:04.150]  So what was the distance between you and Gavin
[15:04.150 --> 15:04.950]  for this?
[15:06.390 --> 15:07.150]  Physical distance?
[15:07.630 --> 15:08.510]  Physical distance?
[15:08.930 --> 15:10.890]  As little as one foot when I went over to
[15:10.890 --> 15:12.350]  pop up my camera.
[15:12.790 --> 15:14.850]  When we were hanging out, I would say
[15:14.850 --> 15:16.070]  18 feet.
[15:16.890 --> 15:18.270]  In an open room.
[15:19.130 --> 15:21.330]  How much time do you have to get to the podcast, Gavin?
[15:21.510 --> 15:22.170]  When did you leave?
[15:22.550 --> 15:23.910]  I probably had 20 minutes.
[15:25.550 --> 15:28.230]  Did you at least look in the air?
[15:28.370 --> 15:29.730]  Did you just not think of it?
[15:30.070 --> 15:31.810]  No, because it's like
[15:31.810 --> 15:32.750]  a 20 minute ride away.
[15:32.990 --> 15:35.010]  So I'm taking a piss,
[15:35.010 --> 15:36.670]  and then I went to try and get some food,
[15:36.710 --> 15:38.690]  I realized I didn't have time for that, so I just hopped in a
[15:39.050 --> 15:39.690]  little lube.
[15:40.690 --> 15:43.010]  It's a 20 minute drive from where
[15:43.010 --> 15:44.530]  Age records to the podcast?
[15:44.750 --> 15:46.590]  It took me about, I think, 18 minutes.
[15:47.050 --> 15:49.250]  It's like a really bad time to go anywhere.
[15:49.810 --> 15:50.250]  I would have,
[15:50.650 --> 15:53.010]  had I known, I would have given him
[15:53.010 --> 15:54.110]  a ride over there.
[15:54.650 --> 15:56.450]  You were about to be in something, I thought, you know,
[15:56.510 --> 15:58.410]  I'm tagging out something, I've got to be somewhere else,
[15:58.490 --> 16:00.270]  you're about to be in something, see you later!
[16:01.030 --> 16:02.830]  No, I don't know, you didn't say see you later,
[16:02.830 --> 16:04.750]  I didn't even get that! See you later would have been awesome!
[16:05.630 --> 16:06.410]  I missed you!
[16:07.910 --> 16:08.890]  See you later was
[16:08.890 --> 16:09.990]  what I was looking for, man!
[16:12.650 --> 16:13.770]  I don't want to be late!
[16:14.430 --> 16:16.670]  I swear to god, I turned around,
[16:16.750 --> 16:19.070]  and I thought, well, Gavin doesn't like me anymore.
[16:20.390 --> 16:20.830]  Gavin,
[16:20.910 --> 16:22.590]  you're taking an interesting approach to this,
[16:22.630 --> 16:24.850]  because if I were you, I would just
[16:24.850 --> 16:26.890]  say, hey, I wanted to do
[16:26.890 --> 16:28.650]  that, I had to rush, like,
[16:28.690 --> 16:29.850]  I felt bad about it.
[16:30.350 --> 16:31.810]  The way you're phrasing this,
[16:31.890 --> 16:33.750]  it's like you made the decision not to.
[16:34.050 --> 16:35.870]  It wasn't a thing, like, it just didn't cross
[16:35.870 --> 16:37.670]  your mind. You actively said, ah,
[16:37.710 --> 16:39.570]  don't want to be late, don't got time to say hi to Geoff.
[16:40.250 --> 16:41.970]  Was this
[16:41.970 --> 16:43.830]  on this Monday, this was this previous
[16:43.830 --> 16:45.970]  podcast? Yeah. This was the one
[16:45.970 --> 16:47.930]  where you were, like, the earliest you've ever
[16:47.930 --> 16:48.190]  been?
[16:49.790 --> 16:50.850]  If you remember, Eric,
[16:51.550 --> 16:53.790]  if you'll remember, there was one recently
[16:53.790 --> 16:55.690]  where I was, like, ten
[16:55.690 --> 16:56.650]  full minutes late.
[16:57.510 --> 16:57.950]  Right.
[16:58.330 --> 17:00.790]  But we're talking about you being
[17:00.790 --> 17:02.430]  early. I'm not, listen,
[17:02.670 --> 17:04.390]  I'm on your side. I appreciate
[17:04.390 --> 17:06.530]  that you left without saying goodbye
[17:06.530 --> 17:08.690]  to your friend Geoff and came and did the podcast.
[17:09.010 --> 17:10.590]  Thank you. The amount of time that
[17:10.590 --> 17:12.610]  it takes for someone to show up, plus the amount of
[17:12.610 --> 17:14.810]  traffic, I would say varies
[17:14.810 --> 17:16.670]  by fifteen minutes.
[17:17.370 --> 17:17.790]  Either way.
[17:18.510 --> 17:20.410]  It's technically even your
[17:20.410 --> 17:22.610]  car. You could have just told
[17:22.610 --> 17:24.770]  me, give me a ride to the podcast in my
[17:24.770 --> 17:25.050]  car.
[17:26.670 --> 17:28.730]  I need to... Hey, I need to use
[17:28.730 --> 17:30.790]  the car. What does
[17:30.790 --> 17:32.750]  you being late have to do with you now
[17:32.750 --> 17:34.810]  being so early? Is the only way
[17:34.810 --> 17:36.770]  I'm going to get good pleasantry time is for
[17:36.770 --> 17:38.790]  you to be to this show late? Is that how I'll
[17:38.790 --> 17:40.810]  get pleasantries out of you? Am I late to this
[17:40.810 --> 17:42.730]  show? No, but I'm saying you wanted
[17:42.730 --> 17:44.910]  to show up early because you were late to make
[17:44.910 --> 17:46.290]  up for the fact that you were late.
[17:46.790 --> 17:48.810]  Right? Is that correct? So I'm
[17:48.810 --> 17:50.610]  saying the only way for me to get you early
[17:50.990 --> 17:52.690]  is if you show up late to this show.
[17:52.690 --> 17:54.350]  That's the only access to pleasantries.
[17:54.630 --> 17:57.010]  But here the only thing I have to do is walk to my desk.
[17:57.370 --> 17:58.770]  I actually have to wait for someone
[17:58.770 --> 18:00.650]  to show up and go there. That could be...
[18:00.650 --> 18:01.710]  That's quite a high variable.
[18:02.090 --> 18:03.770]  And it's live.
[18:04.270 --> 18:05.870]  I don't want to make a huge
[18:06.330 --> 18:08.570]  big deal out of it. I just wanted to say that
[18:08.570 --> 18:09.990]  I'm going to make a
[18:11.630 --> 18:11.990]  promise
[18:12.770 --> 18:14.550]  to all four of you right
[18:14.550 --> 18:16.510]  now that if I'm ever in the same
[18:16.510 --> 18:18.690]  physical space with you and I know that you're there
[18:18.690 --> 18:20.590]  and I'm there, I care enough about you
[18:20.590 --> 18:22.030]  to come and say hello and goodbye.
[18:22.630 --> 18:24.630]  I will always do that from this point on for the
[18:24.630 --> 18:26.650]  rest of my life. I don't want to make you feel
[18:27.690 --> 18:28.610]  deprioritized in the way that
[18:28.610 --> 18:30.210]  some other people may have felt in the past.
[18:31.050 --> 18:32.590]  This was a twist, because I really
[18:32.590 --> 18:34.650]  thought I would end up siding with Gavin, but
[18:34.650 --> 18:36.610]  I'm with you on this, Geoff. I feel like
[18:36.610 --> 18:38.630]  that was a disrespectful move
[18:38.630 --> 18:40.590]  by Gavin. Intentionally or not. I'm like, what
[18:40.590 --> 18:42.650]  am I asking Jack to do a break
[18:42.650 --> 18:43.430]  show here or something?
[18:44.390 --> 18:46.650]  I like that Eric sided with me and then completely
[18:46.650 --> 18:48.070]  sold me out about how early it was.
[18:49.510 --> 18:50.150]  Right, 100%.
[18:50.150 --> 18:51.910]  Yeah, this again, to reiterate,
[18:52.170 --> 18:53.910]  this is a podcast where we get each other.
[18:57.090 --> 18:57.410]  So...
[18:57.410 --> 18:57.810]  Geoff?
[18:58.390 --> 19:00.070]  Yeah, buddy? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
[19:00.070 --> 19:01.950]  just left. Oh, Gavin,
[19:01.990 --> 19:04.070]  no apologies necessary. That's fine. I understand you were
[19:04.070 --> 19:06.130]  busy. And it sounds like
[19:06.130 --> 19:08.050]  you said it in your head. You said, oh, see you
[19:08.050 --> 19:09.610]  later in your head. So it's like,
[19:09.670 --> 19:11.170]  I just wasn't in your head at the moment.
[19:11.870 --> 19:14.210]  Had I been, it would have been no harm, no foul.
[19:14.430 --> 19:16.010]  It is one of those things where to me at the time,
[19:16.010 --> 19:18.030]  I was like, I didn't even consider how it could
[19:18.030 --> 19:20.050]  be rude or how anyone would even miss me
[19:20.050 --> 19:22.090]  leaving. It honestly wasn't.
[19:22.150 --> 19:24.010]  I just thought it was fucking hilarious that I turned
[19:24.010 --> 19:25.550]  around to check on you and you were gone.
[19:25.670 --> 19:27.850]  I'm like, that motherfucker really just dipped out without
[19:27.850 --> 19:29.890]  having one second
[19:29.890 --> 19:31.990]  of acknowledgement with his best fucking friend in
[19:31.990 --> 19:32.770]  the world. Okay.
[19:36.890 --> 19:37.850]  Fucking paper best
[19:37.850 --> 19:38.530]  friends over here.
[19:41.130 --> 19:41.930]  I have
[19:41.930 --> 19:43.970]  a question for Geoff and Gavin. I don't know who to
[19:43.970 --> 19:45.330]  ask first. Okay.
[19:45.990 --> 19:46.590]  Ask Gavin.
[19:48.190 --> 19:49.750]  Do what? Sorry, what did you say?
[19:51.170 --> 19:52.050]  I couldn't hear
[19:52.050 --> 19:53.910]  you over me. Who am I asking
[19:53.910 --> 19:55.850]  first? I felt like... I say ask Gavin.
[19:56.130 --> 19:57.830]  Ask Gavin. Okay. Well, Gavin, you were just
[19:57.830 --> 20:00.050]  overseas recently. Yes.
[20:00.970 --> 20:01.890]  I wanted to know.
[20:01.950 --> 20:03.890]  This is very important. I feel like you failed this
[20:03.890 --> 20:05.830]  is what I'm assuming. How was the
[20:05.830 --> 20:07.870]  Branston pizza? I couldn't find it.
[20:07.970 --> 20:09.570]  I went, I found a, what's
[20:09.570 --> 20:11.810]  Pepper John's? I found one.
[20:14.130 --> 20:14.850]  Pepper John's.
[20:15.630 --> 20:15.990]  Papa?
[20:16.610 --> 20:16.970]  Papa.
[20:17.870 --> 20:18.590]  Papa John's.
[20:19.710 --> 20:21.470]  I found Papa's and
[20:22.670 --> 20:23.890]  they weren't, the one I
[20:23.890 --> 20:24.770]  found didn't do it.
[20:26.330 --> 20:27.950]  Wait, did you actually try?
[20:28.690 --> 20:29.790]  Yeah. I was like, did you do
[20:29.790 --> 20:31.610]  the Branston pickle thing? And they were like, we didn't have that one here.
[20:31.770 --> 20:33.410]  Oh, you get way more credit for me.
[20:33.530 --> 20:35.650]  It didn't even cross my mind. I had the
[20:35.650 --> 20:37.890]  realization that you could do that literally yesterday.
[20:38.070 --> 20:39.290]  So I wrote up my notes assuming
[20:39.290 --> 20:41.370]  I appreciate the effort. Yeah, I did it on
[20:41.370 --> 20:43.230]  the, we were walking around London, we went to
[20:43.230 --> 20:45.310]  we did an escape room and I just happened
[20:45.310 --> 20:47.250]  to walk by one. I was like, oh my god, let me quickly
[20:47.250 --> 20:49.130]  check something. But no sign of it.
[20:49.290 --> 20:51.230]  Don't worry about not finding one in England
[20:51.230 --> 20:53.370]  because there is a pizza oven in my backyard
[20:53.370 --> 20:55.410]  with your name on it. We can create
[20:55.410 --> 20:57.310]  the world's best Branston
[20:57.310 --> 20:59.450]  pickle pizza. And if you
[20:59.450 --> 21:00.870]  want, I was thinking about this the other day,
[21:01.130 --> 21:03.570]  my neighbor is a chef who used to own
[21:03.570 --> 21:05.270]  a fancy pizza restaurant. So if
[21:05.270 --> 21:07.310]  we need help, we can even pull him over, though we don't
[21:07.310 --> 21:08.710]  have to. Yeah, maybe we should get some tips.
[21:09.210 --> 21:10.930]  We have a conduit
[21:10.930 --> 21:13.250]  for excellent pizza if we need it. Or we can just
[21:13.250 --> 21:15.010]  fucking fly blind, you know,
[21:15.090 --> 21:16.930]  do it ourselves, f***face style. Doesn't matter to me.
[21:17.290 --> 21:19.330]  But I'm excited about making this
[21:19.330 --> 21:21.030]  Branston pickle pizza and I hope we do it soon.
[21:21.350 --> 21:22.690]  I would honestly like to see both.
[21:23.030 --> 21:25.430]  And as we've said, the baseballs
[21:25.430 --> 21:27.110]  and the beanhole videos are both now
[21:27.110 --> 21:28.790]  out on our YouTube channel.
[21:29.090 --> 21:31.370]  So we have the space to start
[21:31.370 --> 21:33.370]  the next video. They're great videos, by
[21:33.370 --> 21:35.310]  the way. It's the first time I watched them.
[21:35.310 --> 21:37.270]  Yeah, you were excited for beanhole. What did you think of beanhole?
[21:37.510 --> 21:39.130]  Beanhole was awesome. They were both
[21:39.130 --> 21:40.590]  really good videos.
[21:41.470 --> 21:43.450]  I could use some background music
[21:43.450 --> 21:44.050]  a little long.
[21:45.790 --> 21:47.230]  No, I thought it was great.
[21:49.690 --> 21:51.250]  The buildup of the
[21:51.250 --> 21:53.150]  bean reveal and like
[21:53.150 --> 21:55.050]  trying to be kind of positive about it.
[21:55.150 --> 21:57.270]  Geoff, you just staring for a long time
[21:57.270 --> 21:59.470]  going, I wonder what was wrong?
[21:59.770 --> 22:00.710]  What went wrong here?
[22:00.950 --> 22:02.830]  It was great. They're great videos.
[22:02.830 --> 22:04.150]  Speaking of beanholes,
[22:04.370 --> 22:06.810]  I do have one small thing. You guys
[22:06.810 --> 22:08.670]  might have both seen it because it came to me via
[22:08.670 --> 22:10.890]  social media. So I assume
[22:10.890 --> 22:12.650]  it probably made its way to y'all as well.
[22:12.990 --> 22:14.710]  But have you guys been
[22:14.710 --> 22:16.350]  made aware of the beanhole festival?
[22:17.350 --> 22:18.770]  No. I saw it was a thing, but
[22:18.770 --> 22:20.930]  I don't know anything about it. Please explain more.
[22:21.150 --> 22:22.470]  We just missed it. It was
[22:22.470 --> 22:24.790]  this week. Ah, shit.
[22:25.010 --> 22:26.730]  In Minnesota, there
[22:26.730 --> 22:29.270]  is a... in Pequot
[22:29.270 --> 22:30.970]  Lakes, there is a beanhole
[22:30.970 --> 22:32.770]  days. Come and celebrate
[22:32.770 --> 22:34.830]  beanhole days in Pequot Lakes, July
[22:34.830 --> 22:36.910]  12th and 13th. One of a kind event
[22:36.910 --> 22:38.830]  is a rootin' tootin' good for fun
[22:38.830 --> 22:40.390]  for the whole family. Dude,
[22:40.650 --> 22:42.210]  it gets so much better.
[22:43.230 --> 22:44.950]  At 5.30pm, they bury
[22:44.950 --> 22:46.310]  the beans on Tuesday.
[22:46.690 --> 22:48.930]  On Wednesday from 9 to 4, it's a craft
[22:48.930 --> 22:50.970]  fair with food vendors. They also have
[22:50.970 --> 22:52.910]  kids activities, trampoline
[22:52.910 --> 22:54.810]  jump, water wars, kids
[22:54.810 --> 22:57.370]  bungee. It's all beans.
[22:57.810 --> 22:58.610]  Beans are cooking.
[22:58.610 --> 23:00.670]  11.30am, this is the big
[23:00.670 --> 23:02.610]  event to me. They crown the king
[23:02.610 --> 23:04.750]  and queen bean. That's great. I swear
[23:04.750 --> 23:06.710]  to God, there is a yearly king
[23:06.710 --> 23:08.970]  and queen bean of Pequot
[23:08.970 --> 23:10.230]  Lakes, Minnesota.
[23:11.250 --> 23:12.610]  And then at 12 noon,
[23:12.770 --> 23:14.270]  they pick up and serve the beans.
[23:15.690 --> 23:16.630]  I think they crown...
[23:16.630 --> 23:18.530]  I think you're like... It's a man and a woman.
[23:19.150 --> 23:20.550]  I hope the crown is a bean.
[23:20.650 --> 23:22.190]  I don't know if it is or not. I don't see any pictures.
[23:22.470 --> 23:24.390]  I was imagining basically like four guys.
[23:24.550 --> 23:25.850]  Like a little crown on a little bean.
[23:26.430 --> 23:27.450]  And then because
[23:29.350 --> 23:30.710]  as you do at a bean
[23:30.710 --> 23:32.750]  festival, from 12 to 2,
[23:32.970 --> 23:34.470]  they have memories of Elvis
[23:34.470 --> 23:35.410]  tribute shows.
[23:36.270 --> 23:38.430]  And then they have a drive up
[23:38.430 --> 23:40.310]  and pick up to go to get beans.
[23:40.470 --> 23:42.590]  And you can buy bean shirts and a bean
[23:42.590 --> 23:44.030]  mug. So here's what I'm saying.
[23:44.650 --> 23:46.390]  2023 is the year of the bean
[23:46.390 --> 23:48.550]  hole festival. We go to bean hole
[23:48.550 --> 23:50.410]  days. We make it a big deal.
[23:50.830 --> 23:52.750]  We have a community meet up
[23:52.750 --> 23:54.710]  at bean hole days in Pequot
[23:54.710 --> 23:56.950]  Lakes, Minnesota. I'm assuming
[23:56.950 --> 23:58.130]  it'll exist in 2023.
[23:58.690 --> 24:00.810]  The second they announce the dates, let's book
[24:00.810 --> 24:02.870]  our tickets. The week we put out the bean
[24:02.870 --> 24:04.970]  hole video and then we missed that by like a...
[24:04.970 --> 24:05.710]  That was yesterday.
[24:07.590 --> 24:08.710]  The timing is
[24:08.710 --> 24:10.090]  insane. Damn.
[24:10.490 --> 24:12.590]  I love the fact that there is an Elvis tribute
[24:12.590 --> 24:14.430]  show just in the middle of this. What
[24:14.430 --> 24:16.750]  else could you need at a bean hole event?
[24:16.750 --> 24:18.010]  Was he a big bean hole guy?
[24:18.410 --> 24:19.870]  I don't think so.
[24:20.370 --> 24:22.490]  I think they're limited on whatever entertainment
[24:22.490 --> 24:23.930]  is available in town.
[24:24.270 --> 24:26.390]  Let's go get
[24:26.390 --> 24:28.470]  Gary to dust off his guitar and do
[24:28.470 --> 24:30.510]  the Elvis thing again. There's nothing better than
[24:30.510 --> 24:32.350]  the serving of the beans to then
[24:32.350 --> 24:34.710]  have the memories of Elvis in the background.
[24:34.890 --> 24:36.770]  When I'm eating beans, I want to reminisce
[24:36.770 --> 24:38.190]  about those great Elvis memories.
[24:38.490 --> 24:39.630]  I wonder if he sings
[24:39.630 --> 24:42.630]  like a hunk a hunk a bean in love.
[24:45.310 --> 24:46.690]  You ain't nothing but a
[24:46.690 --> 24:48.470]  bean hole. Farting all
[24:48.470 --> 24:50.510]  the time. Dude, he could do all kinds of
[24:50.510 --> 24:52.090]  bean related parodies. That'd be awesome.
[24:52.310 --> 24:54.670]  He could be like, for all we know, that dude is the
[24:54.670 --> 24:55.890]  Weird Al Yankovic of beans.
[24:58.510 --> 25:00.450]  I'd love if that person existed. I hope
[25:00.450 --> 25:02.570]  that they are. If there isn't, if they aren't
[25:02.570 --> 25:04.390]  the Weird Al of beans, we need to find the
[25:04.390 --> 25:05.730]  Weird Al of beans because they exist.
[25:06.530 --> 25:06.910]  There's somewhere.
[25:07.790 --> 25:10.210]  Eric, if you could go ahead and put that on the books.
[25:11.290 --> 25:12.570]  2023 bean hole days.
[25:13.190 --> 25:14.010]  You got it. I'll start.
[25:15.030 --> 25:16.850]  Booking tickets or hotels?
[25:16.890 --> 25:18.530]  Do you think there's hotels or do you
[25:18.530 --> 25:20.670]  think it's like a camping thing like a Coachella
[25:20.670 --> 25:22.030]  where you have to sleep in a tent?
[25:22.370 --> 25:23.130]  I'm down for either.
[25:24.330 --> 25:26.590]  You're down to sleep in a tent at the
[25:26.590 --> 25:28.550]  bean festival? Yeah, dude!
[25:28.810 --> 25:30.330]  It's a fucking win-and-roam, man!
[25:31.770 --> 25:34.530]  These are simple bean people living a beany
[25:34.530 --> 25:36.510]  life. I want to immerse myself
[25:36.510 --> 25:38.430]  in their world. Nick said
[25:38.430 --> 25:39.630]  be careful where you pitch the tent.
[25:40.930 --> 25:42.490]  It could be, oh no, what if we
[25:42.490 --> 25:44.730]  pitch our tent right on top of the bean hole?
[25:49.170 --> 25:50.550]  It's probably so important
[25:50.550 --> 25:50.750]  to them.
[25:51.990 --> 25:54.050]  Put in their ice cream truck over the
[25:55.390 --> 25:56.050]  groundhog thing.
[25:56.570 --> 25:57.110]  God damn it.
[26:01.590 --> 26:04.610]  I really want
[26:04.610 --> 26:06.530]  you to do round two of beans at the bean
[26:06.530 --> 26:08.550]  festival. No training, no prep, just
[26:08.550 --> 26:10.470]  giving it another go live in front
[26:10.470 --> 26:12.470]  of the people. Maybe we could screen our bean hole
[26:12.470 --> 26:14.930]  video there and then have everyone tell us what we did wrong.
[26:15.430 --> 26:16.510]  That's a great idea.
[26:16.510 --> 26:17.290]  We could make a beat.
[26:18.050 --> 26:19.950]  We've already got a bean hole themed
[26:21.330 --> 26:22.130]  short film.
[26:23.170 --> 26:24.570]  21 minutes of bean hole.
[26:26.770 --> 26:28.550]  This is great. I can't wait for
[26:28.550 --> 26:28.990]  2023.
[26:30.230 --> 26:31.450]  Yeah, I'm pretty jazzed too.
[26:37.310 --> 26:38.390]  If you're somebody
[26:38.390 --> 26:40.450]  who's in the process of trying to quit smoking
[26:40.450 --> 26:42.410]  or even if you're somebody who has, you understand
[26:42.410 --> 26:44.230]  how difficult it can be to
[26:44.230 --> 26:45.750]  fight off that temptation.
[26:46.290 --> 26:47.870]  That's why you've got to check out Fume.
[26:47.870 --> 26:49.770]  Fume is the natural inhaler
[26:49.770 --> 26:51.870]  designed for a better, safer, and natural
[26:51.870 --> 26:53.770]  way to quit cigarettes. It's a no
[26:53.770 --> 26:55.610]  smoke, no vape, and no nicotine replacement

[26:57.930 --> 26:59.770]  Fume handcrafts wooden inhalers and
[26:59.770 --> 27:01.730]  uses cores infused with plant oil studied
[27:01.730 --> 27:03.770]  to curb cravings. They have flavors
[27:03.770 --> 27:05.650]  like Peppermint and Conquer with minty notes
[27:05.650 --> 27:07.690]  to simulate menthol cigarettes, and
[27:07.690 --> 27:09.750]  other flavors like Cozy Chai and Lemonberry
[27:09.750 --> 27:11.410]  Bliss for a sweeter experience.
[27:11.870 --> 27:13.930]  And all of their flavors are 100%
[27:13.930 --> 27:15.650]  natural. No harmful chemicals,
[27:15.650 --> 27:17.930]  no artificial flavors, and absolutely
[27:17.930 --> 27:19.690]  no nicotine. Quitting is
[27:19.690 --> 27:21.670]  tough, but Fume really can help. They've
[27:21.670 --> 27:23.930]  got thousands of 5-star reviews from smokers
[27:23.930 --> 27:25.650]  who have tried everything else, and
[27:25.650 --> 27:27.850]  this worked. If you're somebody who flies
[27:27.850 --> 27:29.810]  all the time, being able to use Fume in the air
[27:29.810 --> 27:31.730]  and in the airport is a huge difference
[27:31.730 --> 27:33.750]  maker. So whether you're a smoker

[28:01.730 --> 28:03.790]  dust your cabinets and organize your closets.

[28:05.690 --> 28:07.690]  with Hello Tushy bidets. After
[28:07.690 --> 28:09.770]  wiping with dry, scratchy toilet paper
[28:09.770 --> 28:11.610]  all winter long, our bums could use
[28:11.610 --> 28:13.650]  a serious refresh. Put your
[28:13.650 --> 28:15.650]  cleanest booty forward and start
[28:15.650 --> 28:17.070]  washing with Hello Tushy.
[28:17.210 --> 28:19.690]  Hello Tushy is a fantastic product. It's so
[28:19.690 --> 28:21.610]  easy to install. It has been a huge
[28:21.610 --> 28:23.770]  upgrade in my bathroom experience.

[28:25.690 --> 28:27.810]  your butthole with toilet paper. Start

[28:29.650 --> 28:31.330]  The Hello Tushy bidet attachment
[28:31.330 --> 28:33.510]  washes your bum with fresh water for
[28:33.510 --> 28:35.270]  a way better clean than toilet paper.
[28:35.650 --> 28:37.410]  Simply spray and pat dry.
[28:37.510 --> 28:39.930]  It attaches to your existing toilet. No electrician
[28:39.930 --> 28:41.890]  or plumber needed. It installs in less
[28:41.890 --> 28:43.830]  than 8 minutes and it cuts down

[29:13.590 --> 29:15.550]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey.
[29:15.730 --> 29:18.070]  The easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone
[29:18.070 --> 29:20.050]  or computer. I love
[29:20.050 --> 29:21.990]  to online shop. I'm pretty sure I mention it
[29:21.990 --> 29:24.130]  every time we do this. Shopping in person
[29:24.130 --> 29:26.170]  sucks. You have to be in line.
[29:26.570 --> 29:28.190]  Sometimes the thing that you want
[29:28.190 --> 29:29.850]  isn't even there even though it says so
[29:29.850 --> 29:31.450]  on the website. It's a disaster.
[29:31.870 --> 29:33.850]  But anytime I shop online
[29:33.850 --> 29:35.850]  I never have a promo code ready
[29:35.850 --> 29:37.890]  to go at checkout. But thanks to Honey
[29:37.890 --> 29:39.950]  manually searching for coupon codes
[29:39.950 --> 29:41.810]  is a thing of the past. Honey is
[29:41.810 --> 29:44.030]  the free shopping tool that scours the internet
[29:44.030 --> 29:46.030]  for promo codes and applies the best
[29:46.030 --> 29:47.530]  one it finds to your cart.
[29:48.350 --> 29:50.030]  Now how it works is imagine you're shopping
[29:50.030 --> 29:51.550]  on one of your favorite sites.
[29:52.010 --> 29:53.890]  When you check out, the Honey button appears
[29:53.890 --> 29:55.310]  and all you have to do is click
[29:55.810 --> 29:57.950]  Apply Coupons. Wait a few seconds
[29:57.950 --> 29:59.870]  as Honey searches for coupons it can find for
[29:59.870 --> 30:02.050]  that site. If Honey finds a working
[30:02.050 --> 30:03.990]  coupon, you'll watch the prices
[30:03.990 --> 30:06.190]  drop. I've used Honey to save money
[30:06.190 --> 30:08.290]  on food orders, on clothing,
[30:08.450 --> 30:10.430]  all sorts of things. It's a fantastic
[30:11.010 --> 30:12.230]  service and it's free.
[30:12.950 --> 30:14.190]  Honey doesn't just work
[30:14.190 --> 30:16.070]  on desktops, it also works on your
[30:16.070 --> 30:18.090]  iPhone too. Just activate it on
[30:18.090 --> 30:20.110]  Safari on your phone and save on
[30:20.110 --> 30:22.110]  the go. If you don't already have
[30:22.110 --> 30:23.970]  Honey, you could be straight up missing
[30:23.970 --> 30:25.970]  out. And by getting it, you'll be
[30:25.970 --> 30:28.070]  doing yourself a solid in supporting this show.
[30:28.410 --> 30:30.270]  I never recommend something I don't use.

[30:36.690 --> 30:38.050]  slash face.
[30:40.490 --> 30:42.010]  I got a clip.
[30:42.550 --> 30:43.030]  Uh oh.
[30:43.850 --> 30:45.350]  You have a clip?
[30:45.790 --> 30:48.250]  I've just got a thing to talk about. That's never good.
[30:48.470 --> 30:49.850]  This is scary because I asked him
[30:49.850 --> 30:51.910]  specifically before we recorded if he had
[30:51.910 --> 30:53.650]  any audio pulled and he said no.
[30:53.770 --> 30:54.950]  This isn't from our show.
[30:55.510 --> 30:57.430]  Oh, it's too powerful.
[30:58.550 --> 30:59.350]  Going to Slack?
[30:59.350 --> 31:00.050]  Going to Slack.
[31:01.650 --> 31:03.290]  I don't have Slack set up.
[31:03.330 --> 31:04.750]  You don't have Slack?
[31:05.350 --> 31:06.490]  Not on this computer, no.
[31:07.230 --> 31:09.490]  What should I do for you? That's fine. Just do Slack
[31:09.490 --> 31:11.470]  and I'll make it work. This is a moment I had
[31:11.470 --> 31:12.290]  with my cat.
[31:13.250 --> 31:14.530]  If you can play the video.
[31:14.830 --> 31:17.470]  It has sound. What Smee does
[31:17.470 --> 31:19.090]  sometimes is he'll just be howling
[31:19.090 --> 31:21.230]  somewhere in the house and it's because he's got
[31:21.230 --> 31:23.530]  something in his mouth. He used to select
[31:23.530 --> 31:25.470]  he used to select
[31:25.470 --> 31:27.510]  Beanie Babies from Meg's collection
[31:27.510 --> 31:29.350]  of Beanie Babies. He'd pick one each night and put it
[31:29.350 --> 31:31.650]  at our door. He'll do it with socks.
[31:32.310 --> 31:33.350]  He basically just
[31:33.350 --> 31:35.610]  kills a sock and then wants to show me.
[31:35.750 --> 31:37.130]  So he'll howl through the house
[31:37.550 --> 31:39.410]  try and walk around the house until he finds me
[31:39.410 --> 31:41.630]  and then dump it at my lap.
[31:42.350 --> 31:43.390]  I was just sat in my office
[31:43.390 --> 31:45.170]  and he was howling and then he
[31:45.170 --> 31:46.090]  dumped it.
[31:46.530 --> 31:46.750]  Okay.
[31:51.210 --> 31:51.610]  What?
[31:53.230 --> 31:54.170]  This is an
[31:54.170 --> 31:55.130]  audio podcast.
[31:56.130 --> 31:57.010]  Gavin followed
[31:57.010 --> 31:59.090]  up a video of a cat walking with a
[31:59.090 --> 32:01.190]  sock in its mouth with a picture of a sock
[32:01.190 --> 32:02.590]  on the ground and the sock has
[32:02.590 --> 32:04.330]  fuck off embroidered on it.
[32:04.790 --> 32:07.090]  I didn't even know that was a pair of socks that Meg
[32:07.090 --> 32:07.890]  had apparently.
[32:10.290 --> 32:11.110]  I thought that
[32:11.110 --> 32:13.050]  was extremely rude of Smee.
[32:14.310 --> 32:15.150]  And I just got back
[32:15.150 --> 32:16.930]  as well. I'd been back
[32:16.930 --> 32:18.890]  from England for like an hour.
[32:20.730 --> 32:21.690]  Fuck off!
[32:22.930 --> 32:24.770]  Oh my god. That's a literal
[32:24.770 --> 32:26.910]  that he legitimately just told you to
[32:26.910 --> 32:28.970]  fuck off. And how it is
[32:28.970 --> 32:30.810]  in that picture on the floor is exactly
[32:30.810 --> 32:32.990]  how I looked at it. Like it was the right
[32:32.990 --> 32:35.270]  way up and the facing up.
[32:36.030 --> 32:36.490]  It's like
[32:36.490 --> 32:38.830]  My question is, what would be more
[32:38.830 --> 32:40.850]  insulting? The fuck off sock or
[32:40.850 --> 32:42.930]  if he walked out with the red one? Your cursed
[32:42.930 --> 32:43.230]  socks?
[32:45.410 --> 32:46.710]  I would have been
[32:46.710 --> 32:48.450]  absolutely terrified.
[32:48.710 --> 32:50.710]  I would have been to put him outside. I would
[32:50.710 --> 32:51.830]  have never known what he was playing.
[32:56.060 --> 32:58.400]  I don't think I've ever had my animal
[32:58.400 --> 33:00.380]  communicate to me that way.
[33:00.640 --> 33:02.320]  That's fun. Yeah, does your cat not hunt?
[33:02.880 --> 33:04.380]  Nah, not really. My cat
[33:04.380 --> 33:06.260]  being as old as she is just mainly
[33:06.260 --> 33:08.240]  just like lays on a couch and yells
[33:08.240 --> 33:10.420]  at people to sit next to her. That's about
[33:10.420 --> 33:12.040]  all I got as far as
[33:12.040 --> 33:14.160]  my experience. Or she just
[33:14.160 --> 33:16.800]  sleeps. Not a lot of action going on.
[33:16.800 --> 33:17.920]  Definitely no hunting.
[33:18.800 --> 33:20.660]  I want to get maybe
[33:20.660 --> 33:22.740]  just 26 pairs of socks with
[33:22.740 --> 33:24.500]  different letters on and see if he starts writing.
[33:28.240 --> 33:30.740]  Just do like a really... because it averages out to
[33:30.740 --> 33:32.780]  about one a day, like one kill a day.
[33:33.200 --> 33:35.180]  And it'd basically be like the slowest
[33:35.180 --> 33:36.600]  Ouija board of all time.
[33:37.180 --> 33:38.540]  Dude, what you could do
[33:38.540 --> 33:40.740]  you should definitely try that but then
[33:40.740 --> 33:42.900]  also just get a bunch of socks
[33:42.900 --> 33:45.000]  with words on them, like verbs and nouns
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.620]  and adjectives, and then
[33:46.620 --> 33:48.440]  he could write you a short story.
[33:50.460 --> 33:51.660]  One word at a time.
[33:52.320 --> 33:53.180]  What words would I have?
[33:53.280 --> 33:55.240]  How many socks am I having to buy here?
[33:55.840 --> 33:57.380]  You'd probably buy a hundred pairs of socks.
[33:57.740 --> 33:58.860]  Okay. With different stuff on them.
[33:59.340 --> 34:00.940]  So maybe the hundred most
[34:00.940 --> 34:02.980]  frequently used words? Yeah, but then
[34:02.980 --> 34:04.840]  the short story's gonna pay for itself.
[34:05.020 --> 34:07.000]  We'll sell it. You'll be able to make your money back.
[34:07.140 --> 34:08.980]  What's really important, you gotta record the
[34:08.980 --> 34:11.080]  meows, like when he's howling.
[34:11.820 --> 34:12.780]  That'll be the audiobook.
[34:12.780 --> 34:15.060]  You need to put all those together for the audiobook of your story.
[34:17.620 --> 34:18.920]  We're gonna cover all markets.
[34:19.540 --> 34:20.760]  Eric has... oh, no,
[34:20.840 --> 34:22.780]  he unsent it. The hundred most
[34:22.780 --> 34:24.860]  common words in English. That's exactly
[34:24.860 --> 34:26.700]  what we need. I just figured that would help you with your
[34:26.700 --> 34:28.540]  cat adventure or whatever. You never know.
[34:28.580 --> 34:30.660]  It could be like, you know,
[34:30.740 --> 34:32.580]  31-287-46
[34:32.580 --> 34:34.780]  like you don't know what it's gonna be, but
[34:35.460 --> 34:36.920]  the cat is gonna have a good time.
[34:37.340 --> 34:38.740]  Should I have the ability to rearrange
[34:38.740 --> 34:40.620]  the words after I've been brought enough?
[34:40.620 --> 34:41.980]  Or do I have to take it in his order?
[34:42.380 --> 34:43.400]  I think it's in his order.
[34:43.840 --> 34:44.580]  It's his vision.
[34:47.560 --> 34:48.540]  Let's see what kind of
[34:48.540 --> 34:49.580]  a writer he is first.
[34:49.860 --> 34:52.300]  Let's see how eloquent the cat is.
[34:52.980 --> 34:54.580]  We might need to do some...
[34:54.580 --> 34:56.300]  One of the most commonly used words
[34:56.300 --> 34:57.000]  is word.
[34:58.600 --> 35:00.760]  Should we sell as a product
[35:00.760 --> 35:02.440]  a Sock of the Month Club
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.500]  where every month you get a different one of the
[35:04.500 --> 35:06.540]  hundred most common words
[35:06.540 --> 35:08.320]  in America on your sock and then it's
[35:08.320 --> 35:09.640]  over in a hundred weeks
[35:10.240 --> 35:11.180]  you get the full set?
[35:11.860 --> 35:14.180]  I don't know why anyone would need that
[35:14.180 --> 35:16.240]  outside of this very specific case in which
[35:16.240 --> 35:17.440]  Gavin is having his cat.
[35:17.480 --> 35:20.260]  I don't know if anyone would want a sock with cum
[35:20.260 --> 35:22.480]  written on it. How many socks in the world
[35:22.480 --> 35:23.880]  are there? Or socks?
[35:24.100 --> 35:25.520]  How many cats in the world are there?
[35:25.860 --> 35:26.740]  We could start a trend.
[35:27.280 --> 35:29.740]  I just want to make stuff with my socks now.
[35:30.260 --> 35:32.300]  Maybe I'm an audience of one, but if there was
[35:32.300 --> 35:34.300]  a service I could buy to get the hundred most common
[35:34.300 --> 35:36.360]  words one at a time
[35:36.360 --> 35:37.740]  on socks, I would subscribe.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.940]  And it's one a week. Or one a month even.
[35:40.640 --> 35:41.800]  So two years of socks.
[35:42.320 --> 35:43.000]  Two years of socks.
[35:43.640 --> 35:46.120]  I love the idea of Geoff opening his
[35:46.120 --> 35:48.060]  box of socks, getting his one pair
[35:48.060 --> 35:50.140]  and being like, can you believe Gong is
[35:50.140 --> 35:52.360]  in the top hundred? I would have never guessed this.
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.140]  Can you believe the excitement
[35:54.680 --> 35:55.120]  Oil!
[35:55.920 --> 35:56.320]  Oil!
[35:57.020 --> 35:59.960]  Why do people talk about oil so much?
[36:00.240 --> 36:02.360]  It's like a little present
[36:02.360 --> 36:03.000]  every month.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.840]  Oil didn't make the cut this year.
[36:04.900 --> 36:06.040]  Must have been a bad year for oil.
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.000]  I don't know what happened. Tough year. Dropped off.
[36:09.340 --> 36:10.680]  Not enough oil talk this year.
[36:11.280 --> 36:13.080]  I think if we made it f*** face based
[36:13.080 --> 36:15.020]  like the hundred most frequently used words
[36:15.020 --> 36:16.900]  of f*** face, then it would be
[36:16.900 --> 36:19.060]  a much more interesting collection because you'd have
[36:19.700 --> 36:21.120]  Keenan and Cal written on some
[36:21.120 --> 36:21.380]  socks.
[36:22.800 --> 36:24.700]  That has to be the most mentioned
[36:24.700 --> 36:26.140]  thing, I would say.
[36:27.100 --> 36:28.120]  Yeah, I would think so.
[36:28.940 --> 36:30.060]  Tuxedo's gotta be getting up there.
[36:30.900 --> 36:31.340]  Tuxedo...
[36:31.340 --> 36:33.620]  Oh, I have a really important question
[36:33.620 --> 36:35.340]  about the tuxedo
[36:35.340 --> 36:37.120]  and my Get Outta Gregg free card.
[36:37.620 --> 36:39.640]  I just had this thought. Because we got it,
[36:39.720 --> 36:41.460]  it's all secure. Well, we don't have it.
[36:41.700 --> 36:43.540]  We bought it, we don't have it.
[36:43.620 --> 36:45.880]  It hasn't shipped yet. There's part of me
[36:45.880 --> 36:47.700]  that is terrified that somehow
[36:47.700 --> 36:49.040]  it will get f***ed up in shipping.
[36:50.080 --> 36:51.960]  Can I use my Get Outta Gregg
[36:51.960 --> 36:53.860]  free card on the tuxedo itself?
[36:54.240 --> 36:55.760]  Or is that exempt from the card?
[36:56.280 --> 36:57.840]  Well, how have you Gregged the tuxedo?
[36:57.840 --> 36:59.880]  Well, I haven't yet, but I'm saying
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.680]  if somehow I did...
[37:01.680 --> 37:03.960]  But if something happens to the
[37:03.960 --> 37:06.040]  tuxedo in transit, that won't be your fault
[37:06.040 --> 37:07.680]  and you wouldn't need to use the card.
[37:08.040 --> 37:09.740]  Well, I'm saying if, like, the wrong
[37:09.740 --> 37:11.960]  address was somehow there. If I filled out
[37:11.960 --> 37:13.560]  something wrong, I didn't.
[37:13.860 --> 37:15.800]  But I'm just paranoid. I'm paranoid
[37:15.800 --> 37:17.480]  that this is somehow gonna blow up in my face.
[37:17.560 --> 37:19.680]  If you're not able to rectify it, then yeah,
[37:19.740 --> 37:21.260]  I think you would be able to use the Get Outta Gregg.
[37:21.260 --> 37:23.640]  Okay, so the card applies to the tuxedo.
[37:23.740 --> 37:25.680]  I gained it from successfully doing
[37:25.680 --> 37:27.440]  the tuxedo, but I could still
[37:27.440 --> 37:29.720]  potentially use it on a tuxedo
[37:29.720 --> 37:31.780]  Gregg. I would hate for you
[37:31.780 --> 37:33.640]  to get it for successfully
[37:33.640 --> 37:35.700]  getting the tuxedo and then lose it for
[37:35.700 --> 37:37.720]  fucking it up in a handoff. Like,
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.500]  it just seems like a real waste
[37:39.500 --> 37:41.520]  of a Get Outta Gregg free card.
[37:41.900 --> 37:43.160]  And I also have some plans
[37:43.660 --> 37:45.920]  I have some plans for that fucking tuxedo.
[37:46.340 --> 37:47.060]  Hear me out.
[37:47.700 --> 37:49.740]  Have you guys ever looked at the tuxedo movie
[37:49.740 --> 37:51.660]  poster? Yes. I
[37:51.660 --> 37:52.940]  think we might
[37:52.940 --> 37:54.640]  want to consider
[37:54.640 --> 37:57.320]  I was thinking, like, now we have this amazing tuxedo
[37:58.120 --> 37:59.140]  what can
[37:59.140 --> 37:59.900]  we do with it, right?
[38:00.140 --> 38:02.900]  I think what we could do is potentially
[38:02.900 --> 38:04.940]  recreate this movie poster
[38:04.940 --> 38:06.860]  with Gavin in the
[38:06.860 --> 38:09.020]  tuxedo and VCK on the
[38:09.020 --> 38:10.760]  boot of his shoe and then
[38:10.760 --> 38:12.900]  I could be Jennifer Love
[38:12.900 --> 38:14.280]  Hewitt in the pantsuit
[38:14.280 --> 38:16.480]  and then Andrew could be
[38:16.480 --> 38:18.500]  represented in the
[38:18.500 --> 38:20.840]  water strider computer
[38:20.840 --> 38:21.680]  thing in the background
[38:23.400 --> 38:24.820]  but I could just say
[38:24.820 --> 38:26.520]  our tuxedo.
[38:28.320 --> 38:28.980]  Now this
[38:28.980 --> 38:30.480]  I like. This I fully support.
[38:30.700 --> 38:32.880]  It's a great idea. And he's clearly up in
[38:32.880 --> 38:35.000]  the air during that picture
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.900]  so we could even make use of the harness
[38:36.900 --> 38:38.160]  holes. Oh yeah!
[38:39.080 --> 38:40.340]  I could be on wire.
[38:41.060 --> 38:42.660]  Like, wouldn't it be amazing to recreate
[38:43.760 --> 38:44.660]  this exact
[38:45.180 --> 38:46.600]  movie poster? Also,
[38:46.820 --> 38:48.960]  I don't know why we haven't talked about
[38:48.960 --> 38:51.080]  this yet, but entertaining
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.940]  and fun has got to be
[38:52.940 --> 38:55.020]  the lamest pull quote in the
[38:55.020 --> 38:56.060]  history of film.
[38:58.860 --> 39:00.760]  If you're just listening to this, there's a
[39:00.760 --> 39:02.800]  tuxedo movie poster. Look it up. It's got
[39:02.800 --> 39:04.800]  tuxedo and big letters. It's got Jackie Chan doing a
[39:04.800 --> 39:06.920]  karate kick in his VCK boots. Jennifer Love
[39:06.920 --> 39:08.940]  Hewitt is, like, bemused in the background
[39:08.940 --> 39:11.120]  with her arms folded like, oh Jackie
[39:11.120 --> 39:12.380]  he's at it again.
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.980]  And then right below his
[39:14.980 --> 39:17.100]  feet in huge... bigger than the name
[39:17.100 --> 39:19.300]  Jackie Chan, bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt,
[39:19.380 --> 39:21.220]  a little bit smaller than tuxedo, it just
[39:21.220 --> 39:23.080]  says in quotes, entertaining and fun.
[39:26.180 --> 39:30.740]  Like, you know it's pulled from a quote that's like,
[39:30.960 --> 39:33.300]  you would hope a movie starring Jackie Chan
[39:33.300 --> 39:35.120]  and a tuxedo would at a minimum
[39:35.120 --> 39:36.820]  be entertaining and fun, comma,
[39:36.980 --> 39:39.080]  but here we are. And they're like, got it, entertaining
[39:39.080 --> 39:40.380]  and fun. Don't we need it?
[39:41.280 --> 39:43.120]  I wish I still had my DVD.
[39:43.300 --> 39:45.180]  I owned a lot of shitty movies. I'd
[39:45.180 --> 39:47.220]  love to go through and try to just find the
[39:47.220 --> 39:49.200]  worst one of those. Cause they all have
[39:49.200 --> 39:49.400]  them.
[39:50.820 --> 39:53.080]  I'm always curious the process of, like, how
[39:53.080 --> 39:55.180]  you get contacted for that.
[39:56.260 --> 39:57.140]  Like, Kangaroo
[39:57.140 --> 39:58.880]  Jack probably has one of those on the box.
[39:59.240 --> 40:00.960]  Did they, like, production reach out
[40:00.960 --> 40:02.920]  to that review? What is the...
[40:02.920 --> 40:05.160]  Do you get paid for having your quote on that box?
[40:05.200 --> 40:06.940]  If so, how much? You do not.
[40:07.660 --> 40:09.060]  Well, I can speak from
[40:09.060 --> 40:09.620]  Rooster Teeth.
[40:11.940 --> 40:12.380]  Specifically.
[40:13.940 --> 40:14.340]  Uh...
[40:14.340 --> 40:15.340]  Let me see if I can find it.
[40:16.180 --> 40:18.600]  All you gotta do is just take it and put it on.
[40:19.040 --> 40:20.080]  Okay. My favorite
[40:20.820 --> 40:22.600]  shitty... Back when I'd get DVDs
[40:22.600 --> 40:24.540]  all the time, you always look at the back for, like, special
[40:24.540 --> 40:26.260]  features, and you knew they were reaching
[40:26.260 --> 40:28.320]  when the top thing was interactive menu.
[40:30.060 --> 40:30.860]  The great...
[40:30.860 --> 40:32.560]  This, like, maybe the trailer
[40:32.560 --> 40:34.180]  and interactive menu top two,
[40:34.300 --> 40:35.860]  you know there's nothing. It's useless.
[40:36.200 --> 40:36.960]  Surround sound.
[40:38.660 --> 40:40.680]  Are you trying to find a box
[40:40.680 --> 40:42.780]  that you were quoting on in some capacity, Geoff?
[40:43.180 --> 40:44.780]  Oh, I was looking for an old...
[40:45.220 --> 40:47.040]  for the original...
[40:47.040 --> 40:48.860]  We used to have a quote... I can't find it.
[40:48.920 --> 40:50.080]  I just didn't want to misquote it.
[40:50.140 --> 40:51.200]  Wasn't this one for the BBC?
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.260]  The one that's up there is BBC.
[40:54.980 --> 40:56.440]  But when we initially
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.920]  made it, we... I think it may be on the back
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.620]  somewhere. Or maybe
[41:00.620 --> 41:01.880]  we replaced it at some point.
[41:02.080 --> 41:04.400]  And I'm going to butcher this story because it's an old fucking story.
[41:05.280 --> 41:06.540]  But we got a review
[41:06.540 --> 41:08.760]  from the Village Voice, and I think the guy
[41:08.760 --> 41:10.520]  who reviewed it said
[41:10.520 --> 41:12.560]  it was like Clerks Meet Star Wars.
[41:15.300 --> 41:16.760]  it was the quote we pulled
[41:16.760 --> 41:18.960]  and put on, you know, quote, Clerks Meet Star Wars
[41:18.960 --> 41:20.160]  quote, because we thought that was hilarious.
[41:20.720 --> 41:22.740]  But what he really said was like, every time you get
[41:22.740 --> 41:24.760]  a bunch of idiots that don't know what they're doing together, they try to make
[41:24.760 --> 41:25.640]  Clerks Meet Star Wars.
[41:27.760 --> 41:28.720]  So we were like, perfect,
[41:28.800 --> 41:30.960]  thank you. And we put that up. And then I guess
[41:30.960 --> 41:32.020]  years later,
[41:32.660 --> 41:34.620]  that dude was a professor and some student
[41:34.620 --> 41:36.700]  who was an RT fan was like, hey, you're on the cover
[41:36.700 --> 41:38.840]  of this DVD that I love.
[41:38.920 --> 41:40.720]  And he's like, let me see it. And he was like, those son of
[41:40.720 --> 41:42.060]  a bitches, they misquoted it!
[41:44.980 --> 41:46.500]  While I was in England,
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.680]  you remember a while ago we were talking about
[41:48.680 --> 41:50.720]  a bunch of ideas that we didn't do for RTX,
[41:50.940 --> 41:52.320]  but one of them was to have everyone write
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.400]  or draw the Ian on the wall. And then I
[41:54.400 --> 41:56.620]  talked about how at my nursery
[41:56.620 --> 41:58.420]  school they did a tea towel
[41:58.420 --> 42:00.840]  with everyone and everyone had their self-portraits on.
[42:01.100 --> 42:02.600]  I went to my grandparents' house
[42:02.600 --> 42:03.860]  and look what I found.
[42:04.340 --> 42:06.000]  Oh my god, where is it?
[42:06.100 --> 42:07.040]  Is it in Slack?
[42:07.520 --> 42:08.960]  This should be in Discord.
[42:09.600 --> 42:11.720]  I don't see it. It's not there yet, hit send.
[42:12.180 --> 42:13.420]  This is how I always fuck it up.
[42:13.660 --> 42:15.760]  Gavin, where is it?
[42:16.040 --> 42:17.400]  I mean, it should be there.
[42:17.960 --> 42:19.760]  Yeah, this is what every time I try to do something,
[42:19.900 --> 42:21.580]  this is how it goes. Go into the Slack!
[42:23.000 --> 42:23.400]  Slack.
[42:24.380 --> 42:25.980]  Okay, looking at Slack
[42:25.980 --> 42:26.300]  now.
[42:28.520 --> 42:30.220]  It'd be funny if he just redirected
[42:30.220 --> 42:31.840]  us back to Slack to say fuck off.
[42:31.840 --> 42:32.960]  That was all a bit.
[42:33.720 --> 42:34.600]  I'm just...
[42:35.600 --> 42:36.820]  Oh, here it is!
[42:38.100 --> 42:38.960]  Nursery school.
[42:39.600 --> 42:40.360]  Let's find Gavin.
[42:40.760 --> 42:41.820]  See if you can find me.
[42:42.380 --> 42:45.540]  Wait, so this is supposed to be faces?
[42:45.720 --> 42:46.700]  What is this supposed to be?
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.260]  We all got told to draw ourselves.
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.820]  And you can see the ones at the top
[42:50.820 --> 42:52.300]  are the much younger kids.
[42:52.640 --> 42:53.780]  They look like dog shit.
[42:55.440 --> 42:57.060]  And we're all getting older as it goes down.
[42:57.280 --> 42:58.880]  I really want to meet Harriet.
[42:58.880 --> 43:00.200]  I found you!
[43:00.200 --> 43:01.060]  I found you!
[43:01.420 --> 43:03.760]  Is it above you or below you?
[43:04.120 --> 43:05.000]  It's above you.
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.940]  Yeah, I've got you.
[43:09.080 --> 43:10.760]  I like Abby a lot.
[43:10.920 --> 43:13.040]  Abby's got a whole Mr. Potato Head going on.
[43:13.340 --> 43:15.400]  Luke looks like a
[43:15.400 --> 43:15.800]  fucking
[43:17.360 --> 43:18.460]  dickhead with eyeballs.
[43:20.420 --> 43:21.640]  Some of them are so funny.
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.700]  I didn't give myself a body.
[43:24.220 --> 43:25.760]  I got legs coming straight out of my chin.
[43:25.760 --> 43:27.220]  Did you find Gavin yet?
[43:27.340 --> 43:27.900]  I did.
[43:29.480 --> 43:30.820]  Everybody's looking for him. He's on the left.
[43:31.560 --> 43:34.100]  Yeah, I circled him for you as well.
[43:34.180 --> 43:35.240]  Oh, me. Not him.
[43:36.500 --> 43:37.940]  Can I ask you a question?
[43:38.380 --> 43:38.600]  Yeah.
[43:39.140 --> 43:41.500]  Can we put this on something?
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.060]  Just you. I don't want the rest of them.
[43:44.240 --> 43:45.820]  Can we make a
[43:45.820 --> 43:46.620]  f***ing face detail?
[43:48.720 --> 43:50.680]  It's what the rest of us draw.
[43:51.020 --> 43:51.920]  But we use yours
[43:51.920 --> 43:52.760]  from second grade.
[43:54.220 --> 43:54.960]  What is your
[43:54.960 --> 43:56.740]  f***ing... what is this little
[43:56.740 --> 43:58.700]  black... what is that hat? Is that a hat?
[43:58.900 --> 43:59.740]  It's my hair.
[44:01.000 --> 44:01.960]  That's your hair?
[44:03.240 --> 44:05.040]  I thought you
[44:05.040 --> 44:06.040]  got a little hat going.
[44:07.160 --> 44:08.700]  You've got little T-Rex arms
[44:08.700 --> 44:09.620]  coming out of your ears.
[44:11.740 --> 44:12.780]  Drawing that is
[44:12.780 --> 44:14.240]  one of my earliest memories.
[44:14.460 --> 44:15.380]  I must have been
[44:17.080 --> 44:18.840]  two or three years old.
[44:19.780 --> 44:20.080]  So
[44:21.100 --> 44:22.180]  I must have been three.
[44:22.620 --> 44:23.740]  I love it so much.
[44:23.760 --> 44:25.540]  If you wanted to describe this to somebody
[44:25.540 --> 44:27.780]  just listening, if they wanted to attempt to draw it,
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.660]  how would you describe the standard arms?
[44:30.580 --> 44:31.620]  He's got standard
[44:31.620 --> 44:33.800]  ear arms and chin legs and
[44:33.800 --> 44:34.300]  hairball.
[44:37.020 --> 44:37.880]  I'd love if people
[44:37.880 --> 44:39.720]  wanted to try to draw based off of that.
[44:39.820 --> 44:41.220]  I would love to see what those look like.
[44:43.680 --> 44:44.400]  I just
[44:44.400 --> 44:45.980]  love the progression. You can see the ones
[44:45.980 --> 44:47.820]  on the bottom are the people just about to
[44:47.820 --> 44:49.840]  leave nursery and the people on the
[44:49.840 --> 44:51.160]  top are the ones who've just arrived.
[44:51.860 --> 44:52.640]  God, yeah.
[44:54.700 --> 44:55.700]  Poor Nikola.
[44:56.880 --> 44:57.300]  Yeah, so
[44:57.630 --> 44:58.780]  1991, I was
[44:58.780 --> 45:00.480]  two or three.
[45:01.940 --> 45:03.680]  Do you have anything that
[45:03.680 --> 45:05.000]  you did of that age?
[45:05.600 --> 45:07.720]  I do. I need to see
[45:07.720 --> 45:09.520]  if I can find it. I found
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.600]  a thing a few months ago that was like me
[45:11.600 --> 45:13.580]  drawing me and my family
[45:13.580 --> 45:15.420]  and it looks terrifying.
[45:15.420 --> 45:17.260]  It has absolute Harriet
[45:17.260 --> 45:17.760]  vibes.
[45:18.720 --> 45:20.800]  If I can find it, I'll share it
[45:20.800 --> 45:21.920]  two weeks from now.
[45:24.160 --> 45:24.860]  It's like
[45:25.420 --> 45:27.280]  kind of some face outlines and then
[45:27.280 --> 45:28.960]  smoke monster everywhere.
[45:30.040 --> 45:31.340]  I think my favorite
[45:31.340 --> 45:33.520]  one is Joseph, the one right next to me.
[45:34.440 --> 45:35.080]  Let's see.
[45:35.460 --> 45:36.780]  Joseph is good.
[45:38.480 --> 45:39.040]  I'm not sure.
[45:40.060 --> 45:41.460]  His is the most
[45:41.460 --> 45:43.340]  like Geoff's version of your
[45:43.340 --> 45:45.360]  instructions where the face was like
[45:45.360 --> 45:47.060]  off the head hanging above it.
[45:48.720 --> 45:49.540]  Look at Luke
[45:49.540 --> 45:51.400]  right above. Could you imagine
[45:51.400 --> 45:53.220]  him being...
[45:53.220 --> 45:54.760]  It's a profile of a penis.
[45:55.280 --> 45:57.580]  I like making fun of all these like real people
[45:57.580 --> 45:58.580]  who have no idea.
[45:59.080 --> 46:00.540]  I wonder if...
[46:01.800 --> 46:02.900]  Here's a question for you.
[46:04.060 --> 46:05.240]  Here's a question for you, Gavin.
[46:05.400 --> 46:07.360]  You've probably already met him. Here's a question for you.
[46:07.460 --> 46:08.900]  Do you think anybody on this tile is dead?
[46:10.080 --> 46:11.500]  Oh, they must be.
[46:11.500 --> 46:12.660]  Yeah, probably, right?
[46:13.240 --> 46:16.280]  Statistically, a few of them have died.
[46:16.480 --> 46:17.520]  Do you think it was Thomas?
[46:19.280 --> 46:20.180]  I hope not.
[46:20.600 --> 46:21.280]  I hope it's not Heather.
[46:21.600 --> 46:22.560]  Heather had pretty eyes.
[46:23.340 --> 46:25.860]  I like the idea of any one of these
[46:25.860 --> 46:27.580]  committing a crime in real life
[46:27.580 --> 46:29.480]  and having to try to give that description
[46:29.480 --> 46:30.320]  as the witness.
[46:31.720 --> 46:33.040]  Eight foot legs
[46:33.520 --> 46:35.440]  lying right down the middle of their face.
[46:36.900 --> 46:37.600]  I also
[46:37.600 --> 46:39.500]  love the idea of this being a legal issue
[46:39.500 --> 46:41.500]  because we're using people's likeness.
[46:49.820 --> 46:51.760]  I just want to look at these forever.
[46:51.940 --> 46:52.700]  They're so good.
[46:52.920 --> 46:54.340]  We have to do this.
[46:54.480 --> 46:56.720]  We have to do this at RTX next year.
[46:56.840 --> 46:58.860]  Yeah, I think it would just be such a nice...
[46:58.860 --> 47:00.800]  And it was always a thing when they said to the parents...
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.420]  I remember my parents had it in blue
[47:02.420 --> 47:04.040]  and my grandparents had it in black
[47:04.040 --> 47:06.220]  and they displayed it proudly.
[47:06.220 --> 47:09.000]  This throughout my entire childhood
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.920]  was dangled over the radiator
[47:10.920 --> 47:12.720]  by the dining room table
[47:12.720 --> 47:14.360]  so I could always see it.
[47:14.960 --> 47:15.760]  That's so good.
[47:16.860 --> 47:19.060]  I wish this was a tradition
[47:19.060 --> 47:20.380]  in America. I wish I could say
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.960]  that I had one of these from
[47:21.960 --> 47:23.860]  a cute tradition.
[47:24.320 --> 47:24.820]  It's a wonderful tradition.
[47:26.140 --> 47:26.740]  That's great.
[47:27.320 --> 47:28.200]  That's really cool, man.
[47:28.840 --> 47:31.320]  I really do want to make some version of this.
[47:32.260 --> 47:34.060]  Have you seen Ross?
[47:34.060 --> 47:36.460]  Ross? Where are we going for Ross?
[47:36.500 --> 47:37.620]  Is he near you? Above? Below?
[47:37.960 --> 47:39.520]  Based on this, he might be dead.
[47:40.200 --> 47:41.980]  He's below me. He's on the line
[47:41.980 --> 47:43.060]  below towards the right.
[47:44.960 --> 47:46.120]  Oh god, he's all
[47:46.120 --> 47:46.880]  chopped up.
[47:48.280 --> 47:48.680]  Ross!
[47:49.840 --> 47:50.900]  What happened, man?
[47:52.760 --> 47:54.040]  I wonder where he started
[47:54.040 --> 47:55.600]  because the legs are great.
[47:56.500 --> 47:57.640]  The legs were fantastic.
[47:57.760 --> 47:59.000]  Did a great job on those.
[47:59.780 --> 48:02.240]  Unfortunately, the rest of him is in pieces going the other way.
[48:02.800 --> 48:03.160]  Yeah.
[48:03.900 --> 48:06.340]  And to the right of Ross, it looks like somebody
[48:06.700 --> 48:08.220]  honestly, it looks like somebody shot you in
[48:08.220 --> 48:08.980]  right in the chest.
[48:11.220 --> 48:11.980]  You can tell
[48:11.980 --> 48:14.220]  the more advanced students were able to write their
[48:14.220 --> 48:16.280]  own names as well. I clearly wasn't
[48:16.280 --> 48:18.660]  at that level of being able to spell my name.
[48:18.940 --> 48:19.700]  You're there now, though.
[48:20.260 --> 48:21.020]  I can do it now, yeah.
[48:22.980 --> 48:23.600]  That's incredible.
[48:24.300 --> 48:26.260]  I love these. I'm gonna just, honestly, when we're
[48:26.260 --> 48:28.180]  done, when I have free time, I'm just gonna look at this.
[48:28.920 --> 48:29.280]  Carly
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.320]  Carly made, like, a melty
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.060]  happy face. That's pretty cute.
[48:34.360 --> 48:35.000]  Stephen made
[48:35.860 --> 48:37.000]  a little kitty cat.
[48:37.960 --> 48:39.180]  Alright, we should move on for this
[48:39.180 --> 48:40.400]  entirely visual segment.
[48:42.500 --> 48:43.400]  Sorry. Nick, feel free
[48:43.400 --> 48:44.260]  to cut all that out.
[48:45.600 --> 48:46.600]  Or some of it out.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.360]  Are we posting? Is that okay
[48:49.360 --> 48:50.940]  to post or not? Do we have to remove it?
[48:50.940 --> 48:51.480]  I think so.
[48:53.100 --> 48:55.120]  Do you want me to cut the school name out
[48:55.120 --> 48:56.660]  or does it matter? I don't think it matters.
[48:56.660 --> 48:57.320]  Okay.
[48:58.740 --> 49:00.800]  People could look at this on
[49:00.800 --> 49:02.180]  our Instagram. It might be more interesting
[49:02.180 --> 49:04.560]  for anyone who listens that just happened
[49:04.560 --> 49:06.840]  to go to the same nursery school as me and had no idea.
[49:06.960 --> 49:08.300]  Oh, that's wild. That'd be cool.
[49:09.220 --> 49:10.720]  If you're on that tea towel and not
[49:10.720 --> 49:12.660]  dead, let us know. Yeah, we'd love to hear
[49:12.660 --> 49:14.660]  about your memories of making the tea towel.
[49:15.780 --> 49:16.840]  And if you
[49:16.840 --> 49:18.480]  knew Gavin during his quiet period.
[49:19.980 --> 49:20.760]  Or just
[49:20.760 --> 49:22.480]  if you're Harriet, really want to meet Harriet.
[49:25.520 --> 49:26.000]  That
[49:26.920 --> 49:28.020]  kind of leads me
[49:28.020 --> 49:30.200]  to what I was going to ask Geoff. I feel like
[49:30.200 --> 49:32.680]  40 minutes ago when I said I had a question for both of you.
[49:32.980 --> 49:34.000]  RTX happened.
[49:34.340 --> 49:34.420]  Yeah.
[49:34.980 --> 49:37.600]  How are the grown tubes? What happened with that?
[49:37.980 --> 49:38.920]  Well, let me tell you something.
[49:39.340 --> 49:40.640]  Let me tell you something right now.
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.120]  The grown tubes were,
[49:43.320 --> 49:45.560]  in my estimation, the biggest
[49:45.560 --> 49:47.360]  success in the history of RTX.
[49:47.900 --> 49:49.500]  Wow. If you're a regulation listener
[49:49.500 --> 49:51.440]  or comment leaver who came to us
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.500]  from iTunes or however you found us
[49:53.500 --> 49:55.460]  on Spotify and you're not intimately familiar
[49:55.460 --> 49:57.400]  with Rooster Teeth as an organization, we do
[49:57.400 --> 49:59.400]  a yearly convention in
[49:59.400 --> 50:00.920]  July here in Austin, Texas.
[50:01.600 --> 50:03.120]  And at the convention center,
[50:03.860 --> 50:05.200]  I think like Comic Con, but
[50:05.200 --> 50:06.000]  way smaller.
[50:06.860 --> 50:07.900]  But awesome.
[50:09.120 --> 50:11.540]  This year we released the grown tubes
[50:11.540 --> 50:13.320]  there. And they sold out
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.380]  pretty instantly. And I saw them
[50:15.380 --> 50:17.180]  constantly. And I did the...
[50:17.180 --> 50:18.960]  I will say I did the Off Topic,
[50:18.960 --> 50:21.180]  which is another podcast Rooster Teeth
[50:21.180 --> 50:22.980]  does. It was like the podcast
[50:22.980 --> 50:25.040]  to end RTX. And so
[50:25.040 --> 50:27.020]  when I got there, I was like,
[50:27.220 --> 50:28.980]  let's hear the fucking grown tubes. And we had
[50:28.980 --> 50:30.880]  everybody doing them so much that it made Michael
[50:30.880 --> 50:31.980]  so fucking mad.
[50:33.080 --> 50:35.080]  Michael's the guy who runs that podcast. But he went over
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.120]  and told the Guardians to kick anybody out
[50:37.120 --> 50:38.680]  who grown tubed for the rest of the fucking
[50:39.080 --> 50:41.000]  podcast. And I think he was serious. I think he
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.820]  was like really angry, which
[50:42.820 --> 50:43.940]  I told the audience,
[50:44.620 --> 50:46.300]  you've done your job. Thank you.
[50:46.300 --> 50:48.160]  I was like, it's not every day that I get
[50:48.620 --> 50:50.260]  the opportunity to actually
[50:50.260 --> 50:52.160]  annoy him. And so
[50:52.160 --> 50:54.300]  it was a huge fucking victory
[50:54.900 --> 50:56.360]  and a bit of a bucket
[50:56.360 --> 50:58.440]  list if I'm being honest with you. So what did they all sound
[50:58.440 --> 51:00.300]  like all together? I mean, was it just
[51:00.300 --> 51:02.260]  like a constant groan or was it like
[51:02.260 --> 51:03.840]  a bunch of people, were they all timed right?
[51:04.020 --> 51:06.060]  No, no, it's a big mess. It just
[51:06.060 --> 51:08.320]  sounded like it would come in waves where it would
[51:08.320 --> 51:10.300]  like start quiet and then get loud and
[51:10.300 --> 51:12.280]  then get quiet and get loud because people were like
[51:12.280 --> 51:14.440]  turning them over. None of them were like
[51:14.440 --> 51:16.340]  consistent or at the same time.
[51:16.720 --> 51:18.560]  So it was like a cacophony of
[51:18.560 --> 51:20.100]  just wow, wow, wow.
[51:20.100 --> 51:22.060]  It never stopped. It was crazy.
[51:23.360 --> 51:24.440]  You know what's interesting too?
[51:24.980 --> 51:26.480]  I told you guys last time I did that
[51:26.480 --> 51:28.660]  event in Atlanta and I signed a ton
[51:28.660 --> 51:30.180]  of baseballs. I don't think I
[51:30.180 --> 51:31.740]  signed maybe like two or three at RTX.
[51:32.360 --> 51:34.380]  It was weird. It was like not a baseball town, I guess.
[51:35.020 --> 51:36.400]  So I don't know if this means we're not a
[51:36.400 --> 51:38.300]  baseball equipment podcast anymore, but I definitely
[51:38.300 --> 51:40.360]  signed a lot of Zimmers. They were out
[51:40.360 --> 51:41.940]  in droves. That's great.
[51:41.940 --> 51:44.360]  Have you gotten one of the grown tubes, Gavin?
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.600]  Yeah, I got one.
[51:46.140 --> 51:47.660]  It's amazing how much the
[51:47.660 --> 51:49.180]  plastic silences them.
[51:49.620 --> 51:51.860]  Like I kept mine within the plastic
[51:51.860 --> 51:52.940]  case it came in.
[51:55.700 --> 51:57.820]  What do you mean? It is plastic.
[51:58.160 --> 51:59.700]  No, but you know like it came...
[52:02.580 --> 52:03.940]  It came in a
[52:03.940 --> 52:05.580]  plastic like wrap.
[52:05.900 --> 52:07.860]  It was wrapped in plastic and I just
[52:07.860 --> 52:09.880]  had been using it in that. I still have it in it.
[52:09.880 --> 52:12.260]  And I took it out. I could not believe how much it silenced it.
[52:12.280 --> 52:13.060]  Those are fucking loud.
[52:13.500 --> 52:16.380]  I was kind of disappointed at first that they're kind of quiet, but they're loud.
[52:16.800 --> 52:17.640]  I would say
[52:17.640 --> 52:19.720]  compared to the grown tubes I had as a kid, they have
[52:19.720 --> 52:21.100]  much shorter travel time.
[52:21.800 --> 52:22.900]  These are like what?
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.320]  Less than a second?
[52:25.980 --> 52:27.180]  I swear I had one that was like
[52:28.260 --> 52:29.800]  like a real long one.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.960]  It wasn't physically longer, it just moved
[52:31.960 --> 52:32.300]  slower.
[52:33.840 --> 52:35.480]  Like it was packed in tighter or something.
[52:36.160 --> 52:37.800]  Are you sure this is true or
[52:37.800 --> 52:39.600]  is this like a rose tinted glasses
[52:39.600 --> 52:40.960]  thing if you look back?
[52:41.360 --> 52:42.280]  It could be.
[52:44.280 --> 52:45.880]  When I had legs coming out
[52:45.880 --> 52:47.220]  of my chin and a ball on my head.
[52:47.720 --> 52:49.040]  It sounded a lot longer.
[52:52.100 --> 52:53.860]  I'm glad that they were a success
[52:53.860 --> 52:55.920]  and that they were annoying in a great way.
[52:56.160 --> 52:57.860]  And by the way
[52:57.860 --> 52:59.500]  I spoke to so
[52:59.500 --> 53:01.940]  so so so many regulation listeners
[53:01.940 --> 53:03.660]  and so many comment
[53:03.660 --> 53:05.740]  weavers and it was a genuine
[53:05.740 --> 53:07.100]  joy to meet you all.
[53:08.020 --> 53:09.360]  Thanks for coming up and saying hi and
[53:09.360 --> 53:11.920]  taking a photo or making fun of Gavin
[53:11.920 --> 53:13.900]  or whatever you did for me. I really appreciate it.
[53:14.180 --> 53:15.800]  And thanks for coming out and supporting RTX.
[53:15.920 --> 53:17.940]  It was really cool. There were so so so many
[53:18.500 --> 53:18.860]  f***face
[53:20.180 --> 53:21.880]  there were so many f***ers out there.
[53:22.100 --> 53:22.500]  It was awesome.
[53:23.320 --> 53:25.460]  I was so happy to see all the photos from the meetup.
[53:26.320 --> 53:27.180]  The first official meetup.
[53:27.180 --> 53:28.880]  The meetup was awesome. I went to the meetup.
[53:32.280 --> 53:33.440]  I'll tell you one thing
[53:33.940 --> 53:35.460]  I got f***ing tongue tied there
[53:35.460 --> 53:37.620]  for a second. I went to the
[53:37.620 --> 53:39.580]  meetup. I wasn't supposed to or anything. I just heard
[53:39.580 --> 53:41.520]  and I wanted to show up and say hi and say thank you
[53:41.520 --> 53:43.460]  to everybody. And Jack told me about it. He goes, hey, did you hear
[53:43.460 --> 53:45.560]  there's a meetup? And I was like, yeah, of course. He was like, I'm gonna go
[53:45.560 --> 53:47.280]  check it out. And I was like, cool, we can go together.
[53:47.580 --> 53:49.260]  And then the meetup came and
[53:49.260 --> 53:51.480]  Jack was nowhere to be found. Ran into him like an
[53:51.480 --> 53:53.480]  hour later. And Emily was like
[53:53.480 --> 53:55.520]  hey, I missed you at the meetup, buddy. And he was like, oh
[53:55.520 --> 53:57.520]  yeah, forgot about that. Is that around
[53:57.520 --> 53:59.360]  here somewhere? I don't know.
[53:59.560 --> 54:01.480]  And he just kept going. Like he
[54:01.480 --> 54:03.480]  prioritizes the break show. I think Jack's just
[54:03.480 --> 54:05.540]  on another level. He's screwing
[54:05.540 --> 54:06.220]  with us on a
[54:07.520 --> 54:08.400]  level that's...
[54:08.400 --> 54:09.260]  What?
[54:12.880 --> 54:13.320]  He's
[54:14.280 --> 54:15.540]  functioning on some level
[54:16.660 --> 54:17.540]  above us.
[54:17.780 --> 54:19.400]  And I've started functioning on a much lower
[54:19.400 --> 54:20.760]  level apparently. Yeah.
[54:22.020 --> 54:22.740]  Is it...
[54:23.320 --> 54:25.500]  Is the cat in the room with you? Are you feeling
[54:25.500 --> 54:25.740]  nervous?
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.080]  The stock's still here though.
[54:30.300 --> 54:31.440]  Also, RTX
[54:32.660 --> 54:33.800]  related, you did
[54:33.800 --> 54:35.100]  a panel with Bobby Lee.
[54:36.300 --> 54:37.200]  Oh, yeah.
[54:37.700 --> 54:39.580]  Is that for a f*** face or something different?
[54:39.640 --> 54:41.700]  No, he was just there.
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.600]  I would never
[54:44.140 --> 54:45.760]  cross Bobby Lee with RTX
[54:45.760 --> 54:47.820]  in my head. I was surprised to see him
[54:47.820 --> 54:49.300]  there, but I was excited about it.
[54:49.800 --> 54:51.340]  I think you tweeted
[54:51.340 --> 54:53.440]  you were going to do a panel with him.
[54:53.700 --> 54:55.340]  And I was like, holy shit, Bobby Lee is there?
[54:56.060 --> 54:57.580]  That's a great draw. How did that go?
[54:57.580 --> 54:58.520]  What was that experience like?
[54:59.720 --> 55:01.460]  I'll be honest with you, it was
[55:01.460 --> 55:03.620]  a highlight of my
[55:03.620 --> 55:03.860]  career.
[55:05.580 --> 55:07.720]  I did not really know what to expect
[55:07.720 --> 55:09.540]  and it was one of those things
[55:09.540 --> 55:11.140]  where I came together at the last minute
[55:11.140 --> 55:13.520]  and they were like, hey, do you want to do a panel
[55:13.520 --> 55:15.120]  with Bobby? And I was like, yeah, absolutely.
[55:15.540 --> 55:17.040]  What do you want to do? And they're like,
[55:17.120 --> 55:18.180]  you figure it out.
[55:19.780 --> 55:21.520]  I wasn't quite sure how to do
[55:21.520 --> 55:23.760]  that, but I like a challenge
[55:23.760 --> 55:25.560]  and I'm bad at saying
[55:25.560 --> 55:27.760]  no to stuff. So I was like, fuck yeah, I'll figure it out.
[55:28.480 --> 55:29.520]  And then so he flew in
[55:30.180 --> 55:30.620]  and
[55:31.560 --> 55:33.020]  I met him for lunch
[55:33.620 --> 55:35.380]  so that we could build up some
[55:35.380 --> 55:37.360]  form of rapport before we
[55:37.360 --> 55:38.780]  performed together for the first time.
[55:39.440 --> 55:41.440]  So like maybe two hours before
[55:41.440 --> 55:43.040]  the event, we went and had lunch downtown.
[55:43.740 --> 55:45.520]  And I don't know what
[55:45.520 --> 55:46.520]  to say other than
[55:47.300 --> 55:49.040]  he might be the most
[55:50.100 --> 55:50.540]  spiritually
[55:53.260 --> 55:53.700]  aligned
[55:53.700 --> 55:55.660]  with face out of any other person I've
[55:55.660 --> 55:56.500]  ever met in my entire life.
[55:56.820 --> 55:58.360]  It was weird.
[55:59.620 --> 56:01.560]  We sat down and we had the lunch. We started
[56:01.560 --> 56:03.600]  to riff off of each other and get to know each other.
[56:03.820 --> 56:05.640]  Then we got into an argument about how
[56:05.640 --> 56:07.580]  the lunch was going. And then we both agreed
[56:07.580 --> 56:09.560]  to rate the lunch so that we could see
[56:09.560 --> 56:10.940]  where we both sat on the spectrum.
[56:11.060 --> 56:13.400]  But then we couldn't figure out a rating system.
[56:13.560 --> 56:15.620]  And then we argued over the rating system
[56:15.620 --> 56:17.840]  of one to ten for a while.
[56:17.920 --> 56:19.080]  And then we finally
[56:19.520 --> 56:21.340]  agreed and then we rated the lunch
[56:21.340 --> 56:23.420]  differently. And then that made us
[56:23.420 --> 56:25.140]  fight. And then we did a panel together
[56:25.140 --> 56:27.380]  and it was one of the funniest panels I've ever
[56:27.380 --> 56:29.100]  done. And then we
[56:29.100 --> 56:31.340]  were pretty much attached at the hip for the next two days.
[56:31.480 --> 56:33.460]  I just had meals with
[56:33.460 --> 56:34.420]  him and hung out with him.
[56:35.820 --> 56:37.440]  He's just a really funny
[56:37.440 --> 56:38.120]  lovely dude.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.160]  This is probably too early to say stuff like this.
[56:41.380 --> 56:42.900]  But he...
[56:42.900 --> 56:44.920]  I don't care. I'm unprofessional as fuck.
[56:45.280 --> 56:46.540]  I got him to agree to do a podcast
[56:47.400 --> 56:49.120]  with me. So we're going to do...
[56:49.120 --> 56:50.560]  I don't know if it'll be... I mean, obviously
[56:50.560 --> 56:53.080]  the fuckface is sacrosanct. We don't touch it.
[56:53.460 --> 56:55.140]  But at least a couple times
[56:55.140 --> 56:56.920]  a year, I'll do some sort of
[56:57.600 --> 56:59.040]  shoulder content podcast with
[56:59.040 --> 57:01.180]  Bobby Lee that... I don't know if it'll live in the fuckface universe.
[57:01.460 --> 57:03.180]  If you guys want it, it can. Or it can be
[57:03.180 --> 57:05.000]  just an enlarged roost-teeth. But yeah,
[57:05.840 --> 57:06.960]  he's a lunatic
[57:06.960 --> 57:09.080]  in all the right ways. I was worried that
[57:09.080 --> 57:11.200]  you weren't doing enough podcasts, so that's a relief.
[57:11.440 --> 57:11.780]  That's a relief.
[57:13.860 --> 57:15.120]  How do I say no to
[57:15.120 --> 57:16.480]  doing a podcast with Bobby Lee, though?
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.600]  No, that's fair. I'm curious,
[57:18.900 --> 57:20.320]  so when you reviewed the lunch,
[57:20.460 --> 57:22.480]  how did you deliver... because in my
[57:22.480 --> 57:24.140]  head, that'd be a problem of
[57:24.140 --> 57:26.280]  the person who says it first
[57:26.280 --> 57:28.360]  is then sort of guiding the
[57:28.360 --> 57:30.500]  response review. Was it a
[57:30.500 --> 57:32.140]  situation in which you both said it at the same time?
[57:32.300 --> 57:34.320]  Or did you, like, write it...
[57:34.320 --> 57:36.620]  We both kind of said it at the same time.
[57:37.360 --> 57:38.720]  I said eight, he said eight and a half.
[57:39.320 --> 57:39.860]  And, uh,
[57:41.260 --> 57:42.460]  there was a vast
[57:42.460 --> 57:44.600]  difference between eight and eight and a half in our minds.
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.600]  And he was highly insulted
[57:47.580 --> 57:48.780]  by what I thought eight was.
[57:50.040 --> 57:50.680]  Sounds like
[57:50.680 --> 57:52.400]  he's heavy on regulation.
[57:53.020 --> 57:54.660]  He's pretty heavy on regulation, yeah.
[57:55.320 --> 57:56.680]  I would say that. He's a
[57:56.680 --> 57:57.680]  regulation dude, for sure.
[57:58.040 --> 57:59.860]  You get on with Andrew pretty well by the sounds of it.
[58:01.640 --> 58:02.960]  You know, it was
[58:02.960 --> 58:04.920]  funny, because I was thinking to myself
[58:06.140 --> 58:06.900]  as I was
[58:06.900 --> 58:08.560]  kind of like, you know, just spending the weekend
[58:08.560 --> 58:10.740]  with him explaining rooster teeth to him and showing him
[58:10.740 --> 58:12.560]  around and all that stuff, I realized I'm
[58:12.560 --> 58:14.700]  kind of uniquely prepared for this
[58:14.700 --> 58:16.600]  because I've been working with Andrew
[58:16.600 --> 58:17.640]  for a very long time.
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.480]  And I feel like
[58:20.200 --> 58:22.660]  it's just like, it's created this level
[58:22.660 --> 58:24.380]  of patience and babysitting
[58:24.380 --> 58:25.200]  that I can do.
[58:25.940 --> 58:27.660]  I just slid right in.
[58:27.880 --> 58:30.220]  It was easy. I was like, oh, I know this.
[58:30.500 --> 58:31.480]  He peddled the training.
[58:34.800 --> 58:36.220]  It was cool, though. It was cool.
[58:36.720 --> 58:37.600]  He's a funny dude.
[58:38.140 --> 58:39.620]  Yeah, he's hilarious. Love Bobby Lee.
[58:40.220 --> 58:41.700]  So we're saying that we don't have
[58:41.700 --> 58:43.340]  we don't ever have guests on F*** Face,
[58:43.480 --> 58:45.960]  but if we did and we were to break that rule, he'd be great for it.
[58:46.460 --> 58:47.740]  I think he's the first person
[58:47.740 --> 58:49.800]  I've ever met that I thought would be, that could
[58:49.800 --> 58:50.160]  work.
[58:51.540 --> 58:53.640]  In F*** Face. But I'm not saying
[58:53.640 --> 58:55.780]  we should do that, but, you know, if you guys
[58:55.780 --> 58:56.480]  wanted to do like
[58:57.420 --> 58:58.940]  a side thing, we could do that.
[58:59.380 --> 59:01.240]  Sounds good. You know, kind of like we do
[59:01.240 --> 59:03.680]  like, speaking of side stuff, kind of like
[59:03.680 --> 59:05.320]  we're supposed to do in VP2. Yes.
[59:05.840 --> 59:07.900]  I can't wait for that. Let's set the date.
[59:07.900 --> 59:09.320]  Eric, when are we doing it?
[59:09.320 --> 59:11.980]  We don't have f***ing time for this right now. Let's wrap up
[59:11.980 --> 59:13.680]  this episode. We have another one to record.
[59:13.960 --> 59:15.300]  Are you out of your f***ing minds?
[59:15.800 --> 59:17.260]  You heard it here, folks.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  If you've been asking for MVP2,
[59:20.180 --> 59:22.100]  so have we, but Eric right here
[59:22.100 --> 59:23.680]  told us it's f***ed off.
[59:23.960 --> 59:26.200]  We can't do it. So thanks for listening.
[59:26.520 --> 59:27.900]  We have to do more break
[59:27.900 --> 59:29.820]  s***. Like, you're out of your f***ing mind
[59:29.820 --> 59:31.500]  you think we're going to schedule it in the next four minutes.
[59:31.700 --> 59:33.840]  We gotta do stuff with Bobby Lee now too.
[59:34.140 --> 59:35.520]  Thanks for listening to F*** Face.
[59:35.520 --> 59:37.760]  I really
[59:37.760 --> 59:39.580]  want to do that in VP2, but you heard it. Eric said
[59:39.580 --> 59:40.920]  no. We'll see you next week.
[59:41.620 --> 59:43.600]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look
[59:43.600 --> 59:45.500]  at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[59:45.880 --> 59:47.620]  Geoff talks shaving. Andrew
[59:47.620 --> 59:49.140]  betrays the group... again.
[59:49.660 --> 59:51.560]  Let's talk about Survive Block Island.
[59:52.100 --> 59:53.460]  Bluebell Ice Cream is responsible
[59:53.460 --> 59:54.900]  for multiple people dying.
[59:55.400 --> 59:56.840]  Gavin has the strangest snacks.
[59:57.160 --> 59:58.680]  We just spun into Chipville.
[59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.620]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.760]  All that and more on next week's episode
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.720]  of F*** Face.
