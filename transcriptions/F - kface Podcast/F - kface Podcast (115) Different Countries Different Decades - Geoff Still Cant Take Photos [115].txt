[00:15.160 --> 00:19.360]  Let's get rolling all around. This is episode 115.
[00:20.120 --> 00:23.620]  I don't know volumes or seasons, but that is the episode number.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.300]  I don't understand why you don't do the intro anymore.
[00:25.300 --> 00:27.640]  Testing, testing. Okay.
[00:28.060 --> 00:31.300]  Okay, Gavin, can you do the intro, I guess?
[00:31.700 --> 00:32.820]  What is my password?
[00:34.440 --> 00:35.940]  What is my password? What?
[00:35.940 --> 00:43.340]  I need to sign into my work email to upload this file, and I don't know my password.
[00:43.600 --> 00:46.120]  How are you not just permanently signed in?
[00:46.140 --> 00:48.740]  Because I don't use this computer typically.
[00:49.260 --> 00:50.740]  Have you tried one of the F keys?
[00:51.160 --> 00:57.020]  I haven't, so I'm going to sign out on my Mac, and then it has my password autofilled,
[00:57.660 --> 01:02.380]  and I can click show me what the password is, and then I will put it in my Windows computer,
[01:02.720 --> 01:04.580]  and then I can upload the file.
[01:04.580 --> 01:12.740]  Hey, everybody, welcome to episode 115 of F*** Face, starring an American from the 70s,
[01:12.860 --> 01:16.520]  a Brit from the 80s, and a Canadian from the 90s.
[01:17.260 --> 01:23.540]  The most diverse podcast cast that consists of three white men.
[01:25.660 --> 01:28.040]  Different countries, different decades.
[01:28.560 --> 01:32.140]  Wow. That was good.
[01:33.020 --> 01:34.580]  How was the energy on that one?
[01:36.660 --> 01:38.420]  Fantastic energy. Very high energy.
[01:38.760 --> 01:41.900]  It was a disturbing amount of energy to come from you.
[01:42.580 --> 01:42.940]  It was.
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.440]  And for a second episode, too.
[01:44.780 --> 01:46.700]  Yeah, you're coming out strong.
[01:47.260 --> 01:50.520]  I would say I feel a little lost not knowing what volume or season we're in.
[01:50.660 --> 01:51.580]  It's going to take me a minute to...
[01:51.580 --> 01:53.660]  Well, I know the f***ing answer, but I'm not going to...
[01:53.660 --> 01:57.440]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is that? 220?
[01:57.440 --> 02:00.060]  I'm sorry. While we're doing this, I'm watching... I forgot.
[02:00.460 --> 02:05.900]  Two weeks ago, or last time we recorded, we... I think it was episode 113.
[02:06.140 --> 02:11.080]  I mentioned that I had discovered this new sport because of comment leavers called death diving.
[02:11.460 --> 02:12.860]  And I asked if y'all were familiar with it.
[02:13.080 --> 02:15.100]  Oh, I forgot about that. We're going to explain that.
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.060]  We were going to explore it because I think it might be a...
[02:18.060 --> 02:22.440]  I think there's a real, real good chance that it could be something that we could get into.
[02:23.180 --> 02:24.980]  Kind of like maybe a beanhole thing.
[02:25.160 --> 02:25.960]  Let me send you a video.
[02:25.960 --> 02:28.180]  This is a sport from Norway.
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.420]  It's called death diving.
[02:31.900 --> 02:34.980]  It's a seven-minute video. I'm not recommending you watch all seven minutes.
[02:35.120 --> 02:38.800]  But I would say you'll get a good gist of what's going on around 2.05.
[02:39.640 --> 02:41.160]  Okay, so 2.05.
[02:41.900 --> 02:44.280]  Yeah, and then you feel free to bounce around after that.
[02:44.360 --> 02:46.340]  But you'll get a sense of what death diving is.
[02:46.420 --> 02:47.680]  All right, playing for 2.05.
[02:48.240 --> 02:49.020]  Werner Grone.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.720]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[02:52.160 --> 02:54.040]  It's just... Is it just belly flops?
[02:54.040 --> 02:57.160]  Is it just the worst... Oh, Jesus Christ.
[02:57.220 --> 02:59.120]  It's like...
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.920]  That's the...
[03:03.140 --> 03:07.400]  How do they... Is it like splash size and sound?
[03:07.500 --> 03:08.960]  Like, what is the judging criteria?
[03:09.300 --> 03:10.820]  I don't exactly know.
[03:11.020 --> 03:13.720]  I think he bottled it up because he tucked his head at the last minute.
[03:13.940 --> 03:16.660]  He also brought his knees up. That wasn't a great belly flop.
[03:16.780 --> 03:20.560]  I think that's actually a part of it because some of the... I don't know.
[03:20.660 --> 03:23.260]  I did a bunch of reading on it that I don't remember now.
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.640]  But I think that you're allowed to tuck at the last minute to keep from killing yourself.
[03:27.960 --> 03:28.780]  Okay. Yeah.
[03:28.780 --> 03:36.020]  Because I remember when we went swimming for your birthday, Geoff, Go Go Now Joey did a belly flop on purpose.
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.800]  And he just swam to the side and just sat quietly for about 20 minutes.
[03:42.080 --> 03:44.180]  He was in so much pain.
[03:45.100 --> 03:46.560]  Did you call Go Go Now Joey?
[03:47.180 --> 03:47.660]  Yeah.
[03:47.720 --> 03:48.880]  Yeah, I love that name.
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.560]  I gotta get his other friends to call him that and make it his actual nickname.
[03:55.020 --> 04:00.660]  I had a similar thing where I did a dive. It wasn't a belly flop, but I just landed wrong on my nuts.
[04:01.080 --> 04:07.000]  And I had to swim over to the corner by the waterfall for about 5 minutes and just catch my nut breath.
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.940]  I'm so worried about your testicles at the moment.
[04:12.120 --> 04:17.880]  Facectomy aside, when we were digging the bean hole, you were having problems because your nuts were flying all over the place.
[04:17.980 --> 04:19.440]  And every time you hit the ground with a hammer.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.880]  Dude, when you become a big boy, your nuts drop.
[04:23.140 --> 04:26.360]  And then when you become an old boy, your nuts just keep on dropping.
[04:30.520 --> 04:33.560]  Anyway, I think that we should start training.
[04:33.740 --> 04:37.020]  And I think I can see Gav competing in death diving.
[04:37.100 --> 04:39.600]  We just need to go to Norway. It's only a competition in Norway.
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.900]  But they have the world championships and stuff, and they take it very seriously.
[04:43.560 --> 04:46.360]  And I feel like we could be good at this.
[04:46.600 --> 04:48.840]  And has someone died while death diving?
[04:50.440 --> 04:55.780]  I don't know. Check out the guy at like 458.
[04:56.540 --> 04:57.760]  Look at that dive.
[04:58.440 --> 05:00.760]  Oh, a little smaller, younger guy.
[05:01.660 --> 05:02.980]  Oh, he's really pushing.
[05:03.720 --> 05:07.200]  He's got a massive run up. He's psyching himself right up. Look at this.
[05:07.200 --> 05:09.000]  It has to be a splashdown, right?
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.480]  And the guy's like, that was beautiful.
[05:19.820 --> 05:22.280]  It's just so ludicrous.
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.300]  I've never seen a graceless dive before, but that's what this sport is.
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.120]  He was just fucking bored.
[05:30.840 --> 05:34.180]  That's why I was like a bored person in the wind.
[05:34.760 --> 05:37.640]  He got 10s. That was perfect, according to some people.
[05:37.860 --> 05:39.320]  That's fucking crazy.
[05:39.800 --> 05:41.680]  That's why I think we can excel.
[05:42.960 --> 05:48.780]  If there is a group of people that are more graceless than us, I'd like to meet them.
[05:49.140 --> 05:51.960]  Yeah, this seems like a lot of potential.
[05:52.100 --> 05:55.820]  It's like they removed all the skill and you just have to have pain tolerance.
[05:56.780 --> 06:05.840]  Yeah, if I could change the focus of the company Rooster Teeth completely and point it in a direction,
[06:05.840 --> 06:11.160]  it would be in f*** face getting into professional bean holing and death diving.
[06:11.400 --> 06:16.320]  I would put the resources of the 400 person company behind just those two things.
[06:16.820 --> 06:22.100]  It would be all f*** face all the time and we would probably be training in Norway right now.
[06:22.120 --> 06:23.640]  That would be quite the pivot for the company.
[06:24.040 --> 06:25.180]  It would confuse people.
[06:25.840 --> 06:30.480]  Quite the pivot for a niche sport, but you know, gotta take big risks.
[06:30.480 --> 06:33.120]  Do you remember that amazing dive you had, Geoff?
[06:33.180 --> 06:37.060]  Like off the boat, into the little ring, like you went right down the middle.
[06:37.240 --> 06:40.100]  They'd boo that. They'd get a 1. They'd get a 0.5 here.
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.400]  They'd f***ing hate it.
[06:41.760 --> 06:41.920]  Yeah.
[06:43.560 --> 06:47.180]  I think I would come up with like an innovative nut slapper.
[06:47.520 --> 06:51.560]  Where maybe you could see my f***ing nuts reverberate as they hit the water or something.
[06:52.140 --> 06:59.420]  Or maybe I'd go backwards and so the last thing you see as my body goes under is my nuts floating above me for a second.
[06:59.420 --> 07:00.540]  That would be a cool dive.
[07:00.980 --> 07:04.960]  If all of these sound like tricks in a Tony Hawk game, I'm even more into it.
[07:05.020 --> 07:06.480]  Like you just need to keep that going.
[07:06.620 --> 07:09.240]  We need the combos. I'm all about this.
[07:10.040 --> 07:10.400]  Combos.
[07:10.920 --> 07:11.600]  Death diving.
[07:12.060 --> 07:17.540]  Anyway, thanks to the community, the comment leavers who posted that on the subreddit.
[07:17.620 --> 07:18.500]  That's where I saw it.
[07:18.720 --> 07:22.640]  So was that just because, did they post it just because it was very us in vibe?
[07:23.140 --> 07:26.200]  Yeah, I think so. I think they were like, I don't remember exactly, but I think they were like,
[07:26.200 --> 07:28.740]  these guys are a water podcast or they're into water sports.
[07:29.480 --> 07:30.920]  They should check out this sport.
[07:31.160 --> 07:32.740]  They like to dive so much.
[07:32.980 --> 07:39.140]  And then I was like, it was like a whole night of my life was just sitting in my in my library next to the shelves.
[07:39.180 --> 07:40.920]  Just watching death diving compilations.
[07:41.400 --> 07:48.800]  I've really enjoyed building up this newer community of regulation listeners because I feel like so many of them just get it.
[07:49.040 --> 07:49.860]  They just get us.
[07:50.760 --> 07:53.820]  Just the act of sending us that is like, absolutely.
[07:54.500 --> 07:55.480]  Yeah, no, it's perfect.
[07:55.480 --> 07:57.440]  Like they understand us.
[07:58.200 --> 07:59.560]  They're like, we got you, buddy.
[07:59.620 --> 08:00.100]  Here you go.
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.020]  No, it's the best.
[08:01.200 --> 08:03.520]  They are the regulation listeners and the comment leavers.
[08:03.680 --> 08:09.300]  Out of 19 and a half years of building communities, nothing has come close to those people.
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.180]  They're phenomenal.
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.000]  They make albums.
[08:13.120 --> 08:13.560]  Albums.
[08:14.160 --> 08:14.600]  Albums.
[08:14.740 --> 08:15.320]  Not album.
[08:15.900 --> 08:16.340]  Albums.
[08:16.680 --> 08:19.060]  Have you seen the Lego animation thing?
[08:19.560 --> 08:19.860]  Yes.
[08:20.260 --> 08:21.500]  I met that guy.
[08:21.820 --> 08:24.440]  I met that guy in Atlanta when I was at a convention.
[08:24.440 --> 08:25.360]  He was awesome.
[08:25.360 --> 08:27.660]  And I've been meaning to... he Instagrammed me.
[08:27.780 --> 08:30.000]  I suck so bad at... Ben Davis can tell you this.
[08:30.240 --> 08:30.600]  And Rebecca.
[08:30.800 --> 08:33.860]  I suck so bad at social media and getting back to people.
[08:34.040 --> 08:35.500]  But I think that kid's brilliant.
[08:35.880 --> 08:38.840]  Yeah, I believe his channel is ThatBrendonKid.
[08:39.180 --> 08:40.380]  Yeah, if you want to see it.
[08:40.540 --> 08:41.380]  Yeah, I wrote that down.
[08:41.480 --> 08:41.980]  I want to talk about that.
[08:42.200 --> 08:44.640]  There's also somebody who made a fucking child kicker game.
[08:45.140 --> 08:46.920]  I believe their name is Mediocre.
[08:47.020 --> 08:47.800]  It was so cool.
[08:48.300 --> 08:49.000]  It's amazing.
[08:49.320 --> 08:51.380]  I played it with Emily for a little bit.
[08:51.460 --> 08:52.180]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[08:52.280 --> 08:53.040]  It's so cool.
[08:53.040 --> 08:55.660]  It's just that our listeners and commentators...
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.600]  Everybody's so sweet and creative.
[08:57.840 --> 08:58.900]  And yeah, I completely agree.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.680]  We have a wonderful community of people.
[09:01.440 --> 09:01.580]  Yeah.
[09:02.320 --> 09:03.620]  I'm reading into death diving.
[09:03.880 --> 09:06.760]  This actually provides some context that makes me like it even more.
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.880]  It consists of people jumping from a 10 meter high board and landing in the water with their arms and legs spread out like an X.
[09:14.060 --> 09:17.800]  And they need to hold the pose for as long as possible before they hit the water.
[09:18.240 --> 09:19.840]  So it seems that's the scoring criteria.
[09:19.840 --> 09:24.580]  You're trying to get as close to a belly flop as you can without actually getting a belly flop.
[09:25.040 --> 09:27.760]  Yeah, a 30 foot belly flop...
[09:27.760 --> 09:28.560]  You said it was 10 meters, right?
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.620]  A 30 foot belly flop would fuck you up.
[09:32.740 --> 09:35.040]  Like you would do real damage to yourself.
[09:35.420 --> 09:35.900]  100%.
[09:35.900 --> 09:47.080]  Which, by the way, goes back into why it was so fucking crazy that that idiot jumped off the top of the Pennypacker Bridge in Austin and almost died.
[09:47.480 --> 09:47.660]  Yeah.
[09:47.660 --> 09:50.560]  That was 120 feet or whatever.
[09:50.760 --> 09:51.160]  Jesus.
[09:51.580 --> 09:52.380]  Just ridiculous.
[09:52.780 --> 09:54.080]  He didn't go for the flop though, right?
[09:54.540 --> 09:56.260]  No, I think it was 190 feet.
[09:56.340 --> 09:57.360]  No, he didn't go for the flop.
[09:59.000 --> 10:09.620]  He would have been flat like he got run over by one of those rolly things in a fucking Acme cartoon.
[10:10.060 --> 10:13.260]  It would have looked like a Fatality of Mortal Kombat if he went for the flop.
[10:14.800 --> 10:17.020]  All of his skin would shoot off.
[10:17.060 --> 10:19.760]  It would have just been that dude's soup.
[10:21.740 --> 10:23.240]  De-gloved his whole body.
[10:26.820 --> 10:32.840]  This is great. I like this word a lot. I'm going to do some more research into death diving. Thank you.
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.040]  I think it's very cool. Very, very cool.
[10:34.100 --> 10:35.380]  For sharing this. It's amazing.
[10:36.140 --> 10:41.920]  Since the last recording, we've seen a lot of people attempting to draw me on the tea towel just from hearing it.
[10:42.480 --> 10:43.980]  Some very good attempts.
[10:45.800 --> 10:52.900]  It's been so much fun. I enjoyed so much looking through that again and realizing all the poor kids that didn't realize it would be copied.
[10:53.080 --> 10:57.360]  So like their names are backwards. I did not notice all the backwards names on my first look through.
[10:57.620 --> 10:58.800]  Oh, there's backwards names?
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.720]  Oh, a bunch of them are backwards. Yeah, it's fantastic.
[11:02.140 --> 11:03.560]  I assume they just scanned it though, wouldn't they?
[11:03.780 --> 11:07.220]  I don't know, but there's a bunch of names that are backwards on that list.
[11:08.420 --> 11:09.680]  I don't even know how that happens.
[11:09.680 --> 11:15.920]  Even Katie, superfan Jack's wife, sent me her interpretation.
[11:16.300 --> 11:17.420]  Oh, did she really?
[11:17.560 --> 11:18.520]  It was very good.
[11:18.760 --> 11:20.980]  Yeah, we gotta do something with that.
[11:21.100 --> 11:24.040]  Like we were talking about maybe, you know how we had the Ian pocket tea?
[11:24.460 --> 11:30.540]  Like maybe doing something like that or just with the picture of Gavin on a pocket tea or I don't know.
[11:31.220 --> 11:34.400]  Obviously, we need to make tea towels at some point, but I want to get the community involved in that.
[11:35.780 --> 11:38.880]  It's just such a charming image.
[11:38.880 --> 11:39.140]  It is.
[11:39.140 --> 11:40.220]  I don't know how else to describe it.
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.340]  It's so sweet. I'd love maybe next RTX to have an absurdly large tea towel.
[11:46.280 --> 11:48.500]  The hairball alone is just my favorite.
[11:49.020 --> 11:50.420]  Yeah, the hairball is great.
[11:50.760 --> 11:51.020]  Yeah.
[11:52.080 --> 11:54.120]  I wish that was a tradition everywhere.
[11:54.620 --> 11:57.780]  As you said, Geoff, I wish I had one of those that I could look back on.
[11:57.960 --> 12:04.940]  Yeah, I think it would be nice to do a shirt that was you and Andrew draw yourselves now, but then we use my one from 1991.
[12:08.960 --> 12:10.720]  That is a pretty funny idea.
[12:11.200 --> 12:14.660]  Gavin, I had a real I had a real face of an idea.
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.180]  And for the record, I think Gavin's idea is way better direction to go than this.
[12:18.520 --> 12:26.700]  But I was thinking, wouldn't it be funny if we just had one shirt at all times and to to have a new shirt?
[12:26.700 --> 12:28.400]  We'd have to discontinue the old shirt.
[12:28.400 --> 12:36.680]  So like if you wanted to buy a shirt right now, your only option would be anal passage until we replace it with Gavin's tea towel shirt.
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.260]  And then it's the only shirt you can get until we come up with another joke.
[12:40.400 --> 12:43.840]  And we're only ever allowed to have one shirt in production at any any given time.
[12:44.820 --> 12:46.340]  But we'd go out of business pretty fast.
[12:46.340 --> 12:47.120]  So let's not do that.
[12:47.660 --> 12:50.400]  I like it because it's a guaranteed way to lose money.
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.940]  Well, I mean, I'm I'm happy that we got given three thousand dollars to buy a suit.
[12:56.940 --> 12:59.700]  I can't. I cannot complain about that.
[12:59.800 --> 13:10.400]  That was like and, you know, kudos to to the higher ups at Rooster Teeth for for having some faith in us, because, you know, there could be zero return on that investment.
[13:10.540 --> 13:13.120]  It very likely could be zero return ever on that investment.
[13:13.240 --> 13:14.140]  So it's very sweet of them.
[13:14.280 --> 13:16.780]  Oh, I mean, I bought the port-a-potty return.
[13:16.900 --> 13:17.740]  But yeah, that's true.
[13:18.080 --> 13:19.760]  I like this work both ways.
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.340]  I think it's it's all going to be worth it when I see Gavin in that suit.
[13:24.620 --> 13:26.420]  I am so excited to see.
[13:26.560 --> 13:28.920]  So have we talked about recreating the poster on the podcast?
[13:29.080 --> 13:29.860]  We did. Yes.
[13:29.880 --> 13:30.800]  Yeah, I think so.
[13:30.860 --> 13:31.880]  Cool to get the f*** Cedar.
[13:32.860 --> 13:34.880]  Oh, I forgot.
[13:35.080 --> 13:36.740]  I emailed Kevin Donovan about it.
[13:37.720 --> 13:38.620]  Haven't heard back.
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.100]  Why won't you stop emailing him?
[13:41.300 --> 13:43.720]  I just thought it would be a fun piece of trivia.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.680]  I was just like, hey, you're such a stalker to him now.
[13:47.820 --> 13:50.960]  No, dude, you're not going to believe that weird kid that kept trying to get me on his podcast.
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.840]  He hated my movie.
[13:52.940 --> 13:54.420]  He just told me he's buying.
[13:54.620 --> 13:56.020]  He bought the tuxedo from the movie.
[13:56.120 --> 13:57.400]  And he's like, I don't know what to do.
[13:57.480 --> 14:00.060]  Like, is he going to be going through my trash next week?
[14:00.520 --> 14:02.600]  No, I will never reach out to Kevin Donovan again.
[14:02.820 --> 14:06.240]  I hadn't reached out since the last time I attempted to, which was months ago.
[14:06.820 --> 14:08.560]  Because I saw that action last time.
[14:08.660 --> 14:09.700]  Why would you do it again?
[14:09.980 --> 14:10.800]  We go away with it.
[14:11.060 --> 14:12.280]  I thought it would be.
[14:12.500 --> 14:15.760]  Wouldn't you want to know if you directed a movie called the tuxedo?
[14:15.920 --> 14:17.800]  Wouldn't you want to know where the tuxedo ended up?
[14:17.860 --> 14:18.760]  I would know.
[14:18.760 --> 14:21.320]  I think I would hope that it was in good hands and not ours.
[14:21.620 --> 14:22.980]  Well, I would.
[14:23.200 --> 14:24.980]  The best hands, I would argue.
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.960]  I'm so excited to see you in the tuxedo because I think you're going to be so terrified about ruining it in some way.
[14:30.020 --> 14:30.300]  You know what?
[14:30.540 --> 14:31.640]  You should tell him.
[14:31.940 --> 14:33.360]  You should email him one more time.
[14:33.580 --> 14:34.780]  Why don't you email him?
[14:34.980 --> 14:36.440]  Hold on, I'm not done.
[14:37.540 --> 14:40.920]  Just say like, hey, I just want to let you know we paid $3,000 for the tuxedo.
[14:41.040 --> 14:46.780]  So I don't know if you want to talk to Box Office Mojo or how this works, but maybe you could get that added to the theatrical post.
[14:48.380 --> 14:50.580]  Boost it up a little bit more for the historical figures.
[14:50.780 --> 14:51.580]  A little boost, yeah.
[14:52.580 --> 14:57.340]  I'd love if there was data somewhere where someone was like, why is the tuxedo spiking in interest?
[14:57.420 --> 14:58.100]  What is happening?
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.400]  Like we did with the Don Zimmer cards where they're like, is this like a money laundering scheme?
[15:04.540 --> 15:05.280]  What is happening?
[15:05.440 --> 15:06.120]  Why is this?
[15:06.400 --> 15:10.020]  If we could create a rush on the tuxedo in any way, that would make me very happy.
[15:10.020 --> 15:21.200]  Man, did I tell you guys that someone, some wonderful comment leaver gave me an autographed Don Zimmer baseball card at RTX?
[15:22.260 --> 15:22.620]  No.
[15:23.440 --> 15:26.300]  Yeah, I have it right here. I'll take a photo and send it to you guys. It's really fucking cool.
[15:26.480 --> 15:32.020]  And it is his signature because I have his little face autographed.
[15:32.920 --> 15:34.900]  I saw there was one on Brickshed.
[15:34.920 --> 15:35.220]  And it's the same.
[15:35.520 --> 15:37.960]  That I think you opened. Do you have two now? Or is this the same one?
[15:37.960 --> 15:39.760]  That had an autograph? A Zimmer that had an autograph?
[15:40.280 --> 15:41.820]  No, that was a baseball.
[15:43.040 --> 15:43.980]  Yeah, I have that too.
[15:44.560 --> 15:45.780]  And this is a card.
[15:46.060 --> 15:47.720]  Oh, that's the worst photo I've ever taken.
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.840]  I'm going to send you the bad photo. I'll send you the good photo and then the bad photo.
[15:51.940 --> 15:52.660]  I'll just send them both.
[15:52.840 --> 15:55.140]  I wonder if we'll be able to tell which is good and which is bad.
[15:55.300 --> 15:56.940]  Oh, yeah, you'll be able to tell.
[15:57.740 --> 15:59.980]  You'll be able to find Discord.
[16:00.960 --> 16:02.100]  Oh, you're going to love this.
[16:04.140 --> 16:05.260]  Yeah, sure, probably.
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.100]  Wait, how have you made him wink in the first one?
[16:11.380 --> 16:12.240]  How have you done that?
[16:12.520 --> 16:15.820]  You've taken Don Zimmer's eye in the first photo.
[16:17.060 --> 16:17.740]  I don't know.
[16:17.800 --> 16:21.840]  I've never seen that happen. You've changed how he's winking.
[16:22.400 --> 16:24.120]  You did a live Photoshop.
[16:25.660 --> 16:26.600]  I don't know.
[16:29.240 --> 16:32.280]  I didn't do anything differently from photo to photo, I swear.
[16:32.780 --> 16:34.040]  That is creepy.
[16:34.040 --> 16:40.300]  Maybe... what if I'm a good photographer, but my phone is possessed?
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.980]  What if I am... what do you mean? I was a professional photographer. I was a fucking photojournalist for five years. I won awards.
[16:50.160 --> 16:56.200]  I think it's a much greater chance that my phone is possessed, probably by the same demon that possesses Gavin's sock.
[16:56.240 --> 16:59.880]  I was about to say, has Gavin held your phone before? Because if so, that's just cursed.
[17:00.300 --> 17:00.740]  You're right.
[17:00.740 --> 17:04.900]  We should eventually make a coffee table book of all of Geoff's shittiest photos.
[17:08.740 --> 17:16.840]  Oh, I would hate that. To open a photo book and have to flip the book to the side to try to get the right perspective. That'd be so annoying.
[17:17.740 --> 17:22.460]  But Tria would not tug and cheek at all. Tria, like Apple, would treat their fricking design book.
[17:25.700 --> 17:26.700]  That's very funny.
[17:26.700 --> 17:31.760]  Hey, Gavin, you're from England, and Andrew, you're from Canada, and Eric, you're from America.
[17:33.240 --> 17:39.100]  I know Eric is, but you guys, when you guys were growing up, did they have a thing called the Choco Taco?
[17:39.940 --> 17:42.000]  Where you live, like an ice cream place?
[17:42.600 --> 17:43.140]  Had a feast.
[17:43.140 --> 17:51.580]  So you didn't have like a little, like a taco, like a crunchy taco, where the taco shell is made out of ice cream cone material,
[17:51.860 --> 17:56.400]  and inside is ice cream, and then chocolate, like a hard chocolate top with nuts on it.
[17:56.400 --> 17:57.760]  You guys never, you never had one of those?
[17:57.760 --> 18:01.700]  I'm very familiar with the Choco Taco, but I don't know if we had it in trucks.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.380]  I was always a like Spongebob.
[18:04.700 --> 18:05.180]  Or in like stores or whatever?
[18:05.260 --> 18:10.360]  Yeah, I don't think I've seen it in a store either, but I associate the Choco Taco as like an ice cream truck item,
[18:10.600 --> 18:14.420]  and I would always go for like the Spongebob with bubblegum ice. That would, that'd be my go-to.
[18:14.600 --> 18:15.960]  I didn't really explore the board.
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.600]  I think, I think there is some bullshit shenanigans going on right now in America.
[18:22.100 --> 18:24.060]  That Choco Taco has been around my entire life.
[18:24.060 --> 18:28.180]  The Choco Taco was so popular that they sold it at Taco Bell as the dessert for a while.
[18:28.400 --> 18:29.180]  For a couple years.
[18:30.440 --> 18:30.960]  Uh...
[18:31.680 --> 18:34.260]  It's by Klondike, who's a huge company, right?
[18:34.580 --> 18:40.500]  They just announced that they are discontinuing the Choco Taco, and it's gonna be gone forever.
[18:41.040 --> 18:48.440]  I find it really fucking hard to believe that an iconic dessert like the Choco Taco that has been so successful,
[18:48.800 --> 18:51.600]  name another, you ever see a drumstick at McDonald's?
[18:51.600 --> 18:54.780]  No, because they don't sell those kinds of desserts at fast food restaurants,
[18:54.880 --> 18:56.740]  but they were selling them at Taco Bell for years.
[18:57.000 --> 18:57.700]  It's everywhere.
[18:58.100 --> 19:01.000]  I've never met a person who doesn't love a Choco Taco.
[19:01.420 --> 19:05.160]  They're fucking phenomenal, and now they're announcing that they're discontinuing them forever.
[19:05.480 --> 19:09.240]  I'm gonna say right here, I fucking bet you, in less than a year,
[19:09.540 --> 19:14.020]  they will bring back, due to quote-unquote popular demand, that Choco Taco,
[19:14.340 --> 19:15.360]  and it'll be everywhere.
[19:15.540 --> 19:16.320]  It's bullshit.
[19:16.640 --> 19:19.180]  They have, they're, they are not removing it forever.
[19:19.180 --> 19:20.140]  I mean, are you buying this thing?
[19:20.140 --> 19:20.880]  That's nonsense.
[19:20.880 --> 19:21.860]  They're liars.
[19:22.180 --> 19:27.780]  They are, as Davide, as Davide on this season of Love Island UK would say,
[19:28.060 --> 19:29.080]  they are a liar.
[19:29.620 --> 19:30.540]  They are liars.
[19:31.680 --> 19:32.820]  You are liars.
[19:33.340 --> 19:33.920]  You're actors.
[19:34.440 --> 19:35.820]  That's bullshit, dude.
[19:36.120 --> 19:36.820]  It is bullshit.
[19:37.120 --> 19:38.540]  It's a total marketing ploy.
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.660]  They're taking Choco Tacos away from us to make us miss them,
[19:41.720 --> 19:44.300]  so that we can pay more for them when they come back.
[19:44.500 --> 19:46.360]  It's just like a goddamn Mexican pizza.
[19:46.680 --> 19:47.900]  And I'm not standing for it.
[19:47.900 --> 19:51.280]  It's just that the machine that makes them broke, and there's only one in the country,
[19:51.380 --> 19:52.380]  and they're just getting it repaired.
[19:52.740 --> 19:54.020]  Yeah, what is their...
[19:54.800 --> 19:55.200]  No.
[19:55.320 --> 19:57.900]  What is their reasoning for getting rid of the Choco Taco?
[19:58.220 --> 19:59.580]  I don't think they said.
[19:59.740 --> 20:00.680]  It looks really good.
[20:00.820 --> 20:01.120]  They just said they're discontinuing it.
[20:01.280 --> 20:04.140]  Why remove the Choco Taco?
[20:04.420 --> 20:05.300]  It does look delicious.
[20:05.520 --> 20:06.740]  Because I know at the Twinkie...
[20:06.740 --> 20:07.480]  They are delicious.
[20:07.640 --> 20:09.560]  I think Hostess went out of business, right?
[20:09.620 --> 20:13.860]  And then some other company bought Hostess, and then that's why it came back.
[20:14.260 --> 20:14.760]  Here we go.
[20:15.620 --> 20:21.620]  Unfortunately, the Choco Taco has been discontinued in both the one-count and four-count packs.
[20:22.100 --> 20:27.280]  Over the past two years, we've experienced an unprecedented spike in demand across our portfolio,
[20:27.580 --> 20:33.540]  and we have had to make some very tough decisions to ensure availability of our portfolio nationwide.
[20:34.100 --> 20:35.720]  Here's why that's bullshit.
[20:36.280 --> 20:38.480]  Do you know I'm a big fan of Klondike bars?
[20:38.820 --> 20:40.920]  I love Klondike bars, right?
[20:40.920 --> 20:44.480]  You know how many different fucking varieties of Klondike bars are?
[20:44.780 --> 20:47.820]  There are a thousand different fucking Klondike bars.
[20:48.000 --> 20:48.880]  I'm pulling them up right now.
[20:48.960 --> 20:50.040]  Hold on a second. No, thank you.
[20:50.140 --> 20:50.700]  Don't want that.
[20:51.040 --> 20:54.480]  There is the Crunch Bar with Nestle Crunch.
[20:54.860 --> 20:56.560]  There's the Plain Klondike Bar.
[20:56.780 --> 20:58.700]  There's the Reese's Klondike Bar.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.840]  There's the No Sugar Added Vanilla Klondike Bar.
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.500]  There's the Cookies Klondike Bar.
[21:05.700 --> 21:08.500]  There's 37 different ways to eat a Klondike bar.
[21:08.920 --> 21:10.120]  Cut one of those.
[21:10.120 --> 21:13.080]  Cut the Crunchy Klondike Bar and let me keep the Choco Taco.
[21:13.320 --> 21:15.180]  It's fucking criminal.
[21:16.020 --> 21:16.380]  It's criminal.
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.320]  Do you think it'd be hard to make one?
[21:18.320 --> 21:18.760]  That's...
[21:18.760 --> 21:19.020]  No.
[21:19.320 --> 21:20.640]  I don't think I could.
[21:21.100 --> 21:24.140]  They make a Mint Chocolate Klondike Bar.
[21:25.100 --> 21:28.700]  I love mint chocolate, but maybe cut that one out and let me keep my Choco Taco.
[21:30.020 --> 21:31.940]  It's integral to the full flavor lineup.
[21:32.060 --> 21:32.400]  Look at this.
[21:32.660 --> 21:35.340]  You go to their website.
[21:35.860 --> 21:37.320]  You want to see the full flavor lineup?
[21:37.320 --> 21:38.680]  You're telling me...
[21:38.680 --> 21:40.260]  You're telling me...
[21:40.260 --> 21:41.780]  Look at these fucking desserts.
[21:42.140 --> 21:42.780]  You're gonna...
[21:43.620 --> 21:45.320]  You're telling me...
[21:45.840 --> 21:47.600]  That these motherfuckers...
[21:47.600 --> 21:49.860]  Sorry, I'm trying to pad while I figure out how to upload from my desktop.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.420]  You're telling me...
[21:54.420 --> 21:57.320]  That these motherfuckers...
[21:57.320 --> 21:58.240]  Put the Klond...
[21:58.240 --> 22:02.200]  The first thing you see in the full flavor lineup on their website is a Choco Taco.
[22:02.540 --> 22:04.300]  Then a stack of...
[22:04.300 --> 22:05.980]  A variety of Klondike Bars.
[22:05.980 --> 22:07.040]  Then an ice cream...
[22:07.040 --> 22:09.780]  Then two different ice cream cookie bar and an ice cream sandwich bar.
[22:09.960 --> 22:11.420]  You're telling me the Klondike...
[22:11.420 --> 22:14.100]  The Choco Taco isn't doing well enough to compete with those?
[22:14.240 --> 22:16.120]  It's a fucking star player.
[22:16.320 --> 22:17.420]  You know what I don't see there?
[22:17.480 --> 22:19.340]  A drumstick anywhere to be found.
[22:19.540 --> 22:23.440]  They make a million drumsticks, but it doesn't make it into the full flavor lineup image...
[22:23.440 --> 22:24.620]  Because it's not as popular.
[22:24.820 --> 22:27.900]  Because the Choco Taco is revered and everybody loves it.
[22:28.060 --> 22:29.940]  They are fucking us over.
[22:30.100 --> 22:31.340]  We can't let it happen.
[22:31.640 --> 22:32.760]  Also, we should try to make our own.
[22:33.240 --> 22:34.160]  I really want one.
[22:34.160 --> 22:35.620]  That looks quite good.
[22:36.780 --> 22:38.300]  I think it's maybe...
[22:38.300 --> 22:41.900]  Maybe it's the thing, Geoff, where people don't appreciate what they have in the Choco Taco.
[22:42.060 --> 22:43.580]  You say that it's been around forever.
[22:44.180 --> 22:47.640]  Maybe it's just like it's always there, people don't appreciate it, they're not getting them.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.600]  And this will maybe create a wave.
[22:50.120 --> 22:52.920]  I think the closest that I've had to it is probably a Feast.
[22:53.420 --> 22:57.000]  Which doesn't have the waffle part, but it's like the same sort of chocolatey outside.
[22:57.320 --> 22:59.420]  And then there's like a chocolate shell on the inside of the ice cream.
[22:59.420 --> 23:00.260]  Yeah, kind of similar property.
[23:00.260 --> 23:02.100]  Like you wrap that in a tortilla.
[23:02.940 --> 23:07.040]  A crunchy tortilla made out of a waffle cone.
[23:07.320 --> 23:08.880]  And that would essentially be it.
[23:09.340 --> 23:10.660]  I have an issue with freezies.
[23:11.120 --> 23:12.440]  That has been my summer treat.
[23:12.600 --> 23:14.000]  And I don't know, is that what you guys call them?
[23:14.120 --> 23:15.000]  Is that a Canadian thing?
[23:15.400 --> 23:17.720]  So last week was cheezies and now it's freezies?
[23:17.840 --> 23:18.700]  Yeah, is it freezies?
[23:18.860 --> 23:19.940]  Do you have freezies?
[23:21.140 --> 23:21.860]  Is that what you call them?
[23:22.260 --> 23:22.520]  Oh!
[23:23.520 --> 23:24.180]  Like ice pops.
[23:24.700 --> 23:25.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:25.280 --> 23:26.100]  Flavor pops, ice pops.
[23:26.300 --> 23:26.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:26.920 --> 23:30.960]  I eat these like... I probably eat about 12 of these a day.
[23:31.420 --> 23:38.800]  Yeah, I've been struggling to get them because I was told by a grocery store that there is a shortage of the plastic they use to contain them.
[23:39.260 --> 23:41.840]  So it's been a struggle. It's been a tough summer to get those.
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.060]  That has been my great loss as far as dessert treat goes.
[23:45.660 --> 23:48.600]  I don't think I've ever seen a Choco Taco in a store in Canada.
[23:49.140 --> 23:54.120]  I'm sorry to hear that because you can get these like... these are everywhere in Austin.
[23:54.380 --> 23:57.320]  You go to every grocery store and they're just like piles of them.
[23:57.320 --> 24:01.540]  Oh, those? Yeah, exactly. Those are called freezies. At least where I live.
[24:01.980 --> 24:04.600]  And yeah, it's been tough. I've struggled to get them.
[24:05.120 --> 24:09.280]  I saw a stupid... you know how TikTok has like... well, you might not because maybe you're not on TikTok.
[24:09.500 --> 24:11.580]  But TikTok has a lot of life hack videos.
[24:11.920 --> 24:16.500]  Well, there's one where you can take one of those and you snap it in half when it's frozen real fast.
[24:16.500 --> 24:19.280]  And then you get like two sides so you don't have to cut the end off.
[24:19.540 --> 24:25.260]  I've tried it with every single one I've had in the summer and I've had zero success.
[24:25.380 --> 24:27.500]  I don't believe that's true. Yeah, I think that's true.
[24:27.500 --> 24:28.420]  Wait, you're trying to splice?
[24:30.120 --> 24:30.440]  What?
[24:31.040 --> 24:32.360]  You're trying to like join two together?
[24:33.120 --> 24:37.320]  No, no, no. You can like... when it's frozen, supposedly you can just... like the way it works, Gav...
[24:37.320 --> 24:39.580]  I know you don't have a lot of... you don't eat a lot of sweets.
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.380]  But the way it works is that's frozen and then you just take scissors and you cut the end off and then you squeeze it out.
[24:44.380 --> 24:49.280]  But the life hack on TikTok is you just take it both ends and you snap it in the middle.
[24:49.420 --> 24:49.740]  Oh, I see.
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.900]  You have like two ends.
[24:52.280 --> 24:54.060]  But it does not work.
[24:54.300 --> 24:59.180]  Isn't it like how wrestlers like they would kind of fuck the shirt up a little bit before ripping it to make it possible?
[24:59.320 --> 25:01.380]  I feel like that's what was done with your Freezy video.
[25:01.780 --> 25:04.640]  Yeah, it's like when you score something you're about to throw somebody through in a movie.
[25:05.000 --> 25:05.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[25:08.640 --> 25:12.880]  Did you guys ever see American... what was it called? An American movie?
[25:13.540 --> 25:15.840]  No, but I'm aware of it. I've never seen it.
[25:15.980 --> 25:25.660]  There's a scene... if you haven't seen it, it's a documentary about these dudes up in, I don't know, like Wisconsin or Minnesota or somewhere trying to make a horror movie.
[25:26.640 --> 25:30.100]  It's a really great, endearing movie. You should watch it. Yeah, those two dudes.
[25:30.480 --> 25:36.920]  The dude on the left is the guy, he's like the creative guy, and then the dude on the right is his best friend Mike, who's just like a weird stoner metal dude.
[25:37.520 --> 25:43.420]  And it's just them... it's somebody documenting them trying to make their horror movie called Coven, except they call it Coven.
[25:44.180 --> 25:45.600]  It's really funny every time they say it.
[25:45.840 --> 25:56.760]  And there's a scene where he's in a fight in a kitchen, and they score a... they score like a kitchen cabinet door so they can ram his head through it, but they barely score it.
[25:57.140 --> 26:05.020]  And it's just a scene of them like ramming his head into this door over and over again, and he's like, he almost dies, and he's like, maybe we should cut it more!
[26:05.020 --> 26:10.320]  And that's what I think about every time I think of scoring. Just watching him get slammed into it.
[26:10.480 --> 26:14.420]  I haven't scored anything since that chair that you had at the 4th of July party.
[26:23.240 --> 26:26.920]  Dude, that's callback joke of the year right there. That's a great callback.
[26:27.460 --> 26:31.480]  You were afraid you wouldn't have anything for this episode, Gavin. I whipped that one up.
[26:32.100 --> 26:36.540]  That's great. I've always wanted to see that documentary. Have you seen Hands on a Hard Body?
[26:36.840 --> 26:39.080]  That's like one of my favorite. Oh, it's so good.
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.440]  I think it should be required watching for anybody who wants to live in Texas.
[26:43.860 --> 26:45.400]  I feel like that movie explains Texas.
[26:46.020 --> 26:51.660]  I feel like anybody should see it. It's such a perfect... just all the characters in it are fantastic.
[26:51.900 --> 26:53.840]  There's so much natural comedy in it.
[26:54.220 --> 27:01.120]  For people that haven't seen it, it documents a competition at a car dealership where people have to hold their hand on a truck.
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.660]  And the last person standing wins the truck.
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.840]  And it falls like 10 or 12 people that are part of this contest.
[27:07.140 --> 27:08.200]  And it is incredible.
[27:08.840 --> 27:13.160]  It's got everyone from the young kid who's trying for the first time who needs a car...
[27:13.160 --> 27:19.500]  to the grizzled vet who had won in the past and has decided to come back and he's considered the greatest at this random thing.
[27:19.860 --> 27:21.760]  It's awesome. Great documentary.
[27:22.740 --> 27:24.300]  Yeah, you should... have you ever seen it, Gavin?
[27:24.740 --> 27:25.480]  What's the name of it again?
[27:25.720 --> 27:26.660]  Hands on a Hard Body.
[27:26.940 --> 27:27.640]  No, I haven't seen it.
[27:27.640 --> 27:31.580]  It's one of my favorite lines from any movie ever.
[27:31.760 --> 27:33.500]  Where there's this guy... that guy!
[27:33.840 --> 27:34.520]  Thank you, Geoff.
[27:34.620 --> 27:35.760]  That is the fucking guy.
[27:36.400 --> 27:43.620]  He tells this story about how they got an air conditioner that was for a Walmart installed on their house.
[27:43.800 --> 27:48.220]  Because they're like, we're driving by and they were shutting it down so I got it real cheap.
[27:48.720 --> 27:52.180]  And he's like so happy and he's missing almost all his teeth.
[27:52.400 --> 27:52.900]  And it's so good.
[27:53.040 --> 27:53.940]  He's like, we got it.
[27:54.160 --> 27:55.020]  It was so good.
[27:55.020 --> 27:59.320]  And when we set it up, we didn't realize it would take the house 16 below zero.
[27:59.500 --> 28:01.140]  But we quickly learned that it would.
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.040]  Like, it shifts.
[28:02.240 --> 28:04.840]  He's so serious to his house.
[28:07.260 --> 28:11.880]  He installed an AC unit for a Walmart in his home.
[28:12.340 --> 28:14.420]  And it brought it to 16 below zero.
[28:17.380 --> 28:18.400]  It's so good.
[28:18.760 --> 28:21.120]  There's this other guy where they're like, what's your strategy?
[28:21.120 --> 28:23.160]  He's like, I'm going to eat a Snickers at breakfast.
[28:23.200 --> 28:24.700]  I'm going to eat a Snickers at lunch.
[28:24.700 --> 28:26.440]  It's got all the nutrition I need.
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.180]  I fucking love Hansel and the Hard Body.
[28:29.580 --> 28:30.260]  It's amazing.
[28:30.900 --> 28:32.380]  Yeah, it's pretty fantastic.
[28:32.520 --> 28:33.580]  I want to go back and rewatch it now.
[28:34.040 --> 28:37.800]  It takes place in a city called Longview, Texas.
[28:38.860 --> 28:39.300]  FYI.
[28:40.520 --> 28:42.820]  Which is like east of Tyler.
[28:43.080 --> 28:46.520]  So it's like, I want to say northeast of Austin a little bit.
[28:46.640 --> 28:49.500]  Yeah, like maybe about two and a half hours away from us, northeast.
[28:49.960 --> 28:51.000]  Oh, that's great.
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.160]  Oh man, good movie.
[28:53.160 --> 28:57.960]  Two fantastic documentaries that both came out, kind of are in the same era.
[28:58.140 --> 29:01.080]  I think Hansel and the Hard Body came out before American Movie.
[29:01.240 --> 29:08.180]  But they're both highly entertaining documentaries that show the fascinating human condition.
[29:08.320 --> 29:08.680]  I'll say that.
[29:09.040 --> 29:09.400]  Yes.
[29:09.840 --> 29:10.460]  They're great.
[29:15.740 --> 29:20.800]  Today's episode is sponsored by Honey, the easy way to save when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[29:21.020 --> 29:22.280]  I love to online shop.
[29:22.380 --> 29:23.700]  It's the main way I buy things.
[29:23.780 --> 29:26.080]  I always opt for online instead of in person.
[29:26.080 --> 29:33.220]  Whether it's tech or food, clothing, whatever it is, I always try to get it online first if I can.
[29:33.800 --> 29:37.940]  The thing is that when I'm checking out, I never have a promo code or coupon ready.
[29:38.300 --> 29:39.960]  It's impossible to know what's what.
[29:40.660 --> 29:45.020]  But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past.
[29:45.520 --> 29:51.040]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[29:51.720 --> 29:54.040]  Now imagine shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[29:54.040 --> 29:58.040]  When you check out, the Honey button appears and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.
[29:59.100 --> 30:02.240]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons it can find for that site.
[30:02.660 --> 30:05.480]  If Honey finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop.
[30:05.780 --> 30:07.440]  Honey is a fantastic service.
[30:07.540 --> 30:11.380]  I have saved so much money on things from tech, clothing.
[30:11.640 --> 30:12.440]  I saved on pizza.
[30:13.040 --> 30:14.140]  It's just a great service.
[30:14.300 --> 30:15.420]  It's so easy to use.
[30:15.500 --> 30:16.080]  You save money.
[30:16.160 --> 30:16.780]  You just click a button.
[30:17.000 --> 30:17.720]  It's fantastic.
[30:17.900 --> 30:18.880]  I'd recommend it to anyone.
[30:19.640 --> 30:21.060]  And Honey doesn't just work on desktop.
[30:21.460 --> 30:22.900]  It works on your iPhone too.
[30:22.900 --> 30:26.020]  Just activate it on Safari on your phone and save on the go.
[30:26.500 --> 30:29.240]  If you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up missing out.

[30:38.780 --> 30:40.380]  That's joinhoney.com.
[30:43.040 --> 30:45.220]  It's the sound of another sale on Shopify.
[30:45.500 --> 30:48.520]  The all-in-one commerce platform to start, run, and grow your business.

[31:03.880 --> 31:06.660]  Believe me, this podcast started out selling T-shirts,
[31:06.800 --> 31:08.380]  and today we're selling grown tubes.

[31:59.260 --> 32:01.460]  You've heard me talk about VPNs before,
[32:01.640 --> 32:04.340]  and there's so many great reasons to have one,
[32:04.440 --> 32:07.680]  whether it be security or just wanting to access content
[32:07.680 --> 32:09.860]  that maybe isn't available in your local library.
[32:10.540 --> 32:13.580]  But an equally important part in making that choice is trust.
[32:13.580 --> 32:18.400]  I can say with full confidence that ExpressVPN is the best VPN on the market,
[32:18.600 --> 32:19.220]  and here's why.
[32:19.900 --> 32:22.300]  ExpressVPN doesn't log your activity online.
[32:22.780 --> 32:26.500]  Lots of cheap or free VPNs make money by selling your data to advertisers,
[32:26.760 --> 32:28.580]  but ExpressVPN doesn't do this.
[32:28.980 --> 32:31.300]  They even developed technology Trusted Server
[32:31.300 --> 32:35.480]  that makes their VPN servers incapable of storing any data at all.
[32:36.540 --> 32:39.960]  ExpressVPN now uses Lightway, a new VPN protocol they engineered
[32:39.960 --> 32:42.000]  to make user speeds faster than ever.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.640]  I've tried many VPNs in the past,
[32:44.800 --> 32:46.460]  and they can sometimes slow my connection,
[32:46.580 --> 32:48.840]  but ExpressVPN is always blazing fast
[32:48.840 --> 32:52.540]  and lets me stream videos in HD quality with zero buffering.
[32:53.060 --> 32:56.720]  The last thing that really sets ExpressVPN apart is how easy it is to use.
[32:56.940 --> 32:58.860]  You don't need any technical skills to get it up.
[32:58.960 --> 33:01.080]  Just fire up the app and tap one button to connect.
[33:01.400 --> 33:03.500]  That's it. Even your grandparents can do it.
[33:03.940 --> 33:05.300]  And it's not just me saying this.
[33:05.740 --> 33:08.140]  Business Insider, The Verge, and many other tech journals
[33:08.140 --> 33:11.000]  rate ExpressVPN as the number one VPN in the world.
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.200]  So, protect yourself with VPN that I use and trust.

[33:32.260 --> 33:34.800]  Know what I just watched for the first time this week?
[33:34.920 --> 33:36.160]  It was quite the experience.
[33:36.160 --> 33:46.140]  Eyes wide shut. Never seen it before. I had no idea. I was so wrong on what I thought that
[33:46.140 --> 33:52.800]  movie was about. I was aware that there was a sex cult in it. Had no concept of where the story
[33:52.800 --> 33:58.900]  would go. Wow, is it gripping. It's a great movie. Is it good? I just seen sex cult stuff and never
[33:58.900 --> 34:03.480]  thought to watch it. No, it's really good. I think it's a work of art. Yeah, I think it's
[34:03.480 --> 34:10.360]  it's a beautifully shot film. And Kubrick does such a good job of building tension
[34:11.220 --> 34:18.620]  as Tom Cruise is kind of navigating. He's trying to find his way into the sex cult.
[34:19.120 --> 34:22.880]  And just like all the things he does, all the directions he kind of goes trying to get there.
[34:22.940 --> 34:27.660]  And then when he finally does get it, it's just it's fucking crazy. Yeah, like I sort of I went
[34:27.660 --> 34:32.900]  in only knowing about probably sort of what you knew, Gavin. And I assume that the movie
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.600]  essentially ended with that moment and that it would be like him and Nicole Kidman joined
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.340]  the sex cult thing. And that's not at all where the story goes. And it leads to a mystery that
[34:43.340 --> 34:47.580]  is fantastic. And it's just the lighting in it, like the production. Everything is so fucking
[34:47.580 --> 34:52.320]  good. It's perfect. It's a great movie. Well, it's because Stanley Kubrick doesn't let anyone
[34:52.320 --> 34:58.280]  leave until he's shot something 1900 times. It's the largest post-production on any movie ever,
[34:58.280 --> 35:01.800]  I believe. I think it was like 400 days in post or something like that.
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.480]  It was his last film, I think, wasn't it? He died four days after submitting the final cut.
[35:07.620 --> 35:12.200]  A.I. technically is his last film, but he he died while they were filming that. So
[35:12.760 --> 35:17.240]  he only filmed the first. I think he directed the first like he directed up until the kid gets
[35:17.240 --> 35:23.920]  thrown into the woods and then Steven Spielberg takes over. Oh, wow. It's also such a fascinating
[35:23.920 --> 35:29.320]  movie for Tom Cruise to be in, like the concept of him of all people, seeing him walk into a
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.820]  cult scenario and how he handles that. And with like the current context of Tom, it's just
[35:34.820 --> 35:39.560]  thinking that he has probably seen wilder shit than what is in this movie. It's very fascinating.
[35:40.640 --> 35:45.440]  Yeah. It's just like the lobby of Scientology. What was what was the password? Was it like it
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.840]  was like Lothario? It was like, yeah, yeah, it was something like that. It was a Latin
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.720]  word, I believe, and it was related to Mozart in some way. Yeah. What was that?
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.560]  It has so many great cameos and cameo might even be a wrong word. I just don't know if
[35:59.560 --> 36:04.460]  they're established actors, but like Alan Tudyk is in it and like one scene and he's great.
[36:06.020 --> 36:10.580]  There's this guy, I don't know his name, but he plays Russians in movies all the time and he was
[36:10.580 --> 36:15.400]  in Mission Impossible two. I thought, oh, that's so weird that you would be in a later Tom Cruise
[36:15.400 --> 36:21.760]  movie. He owns like a costume store in the film. There are a few actors in that. Thomas Gibson
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.080]  from Criminal Minds has like a really weird role. There's a lot of like people that you recognize
[36:26.080 --> 36:31.980]  in it. Man, I will say to Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, you know, they were obviously married
[36:31.980 --> 36:36.820]  when they made this movie and obvious. And then they, you know, got divorced and then Tom Cruise
[36:36.820 --> 36:44.640]  has gone his route and she went hers. But in that film, they like you're like, goddamn, these are
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.980]  two beautiful people who are in love together and having a life together. They fit so well
[36:49.980 --> 36:55.100]  together. They looked so they had so much. I thought they had so much chemistry, like actual
[36:55.100 --> 36:58.120]  chemistry. You can really I don't know. They seem like they had something really special going.
[36:58.660 --> 37:04.680]  It's a good actors. Yeah. To read about. It seemed like a lot of the production on it
[37:05.560 --> 37:10.760]  fucked with their marriage in a lot of ways. Like they had to do really serious counseling as part
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.220]  of the movie. And it was like Stanley Kubrick sort of created the divide that their characters
[37:15.220 --> 37:19.800]  had within the context of the story in their own personal life. It's really fascinating to read
[37:19.800 --> 37:28.500]  about. Yeah. Kubrick probably had a lot of questions, like stuff that would be considered
[37:28.500 --> 37:33.340]  very questionable now in his directing practices and the way he like exerted control over things.
[37:33.760 --> 37:39.300]  Big time. Eric said big time. Yeah. Big time. Same with all those like Hitchcock as well.
[37:40.100 --> 37:44.940]  Really? I'm not as familiar with him in those practices. I remember like Harvey Keitel,
[37:45.100 --> 37:49.360]  I think, has a story where he was in some Kubrick movie and he made him open a door
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.660]  like 70 different times and he said, fuck you and quit. So he just had to recast the role.
[37:56.260 --> 38:01.700]  Yeah, I think I appreciate. That was Eyes Wide Shut. Was it? I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure
[38:01.700 --> 38:06.880]  that was Eyes Wide Shut. That's awesome. I feel like I like a lot of Kubrick's technical stuff,
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.100]  like a lot of the developmental things gone into camera equipment that started with him. But
[38:11.660 --> 38:15.320]  God, I would have hated to be on one of those sets. Like I would have been,
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.060]  I would have not wanted to wake up every day and go and deal with that. Jesus. I, I fucking,
[38:21.260 --> 38:26.860]  my, well, I've never like, I think all sets suck. I imagine Stanley Kubrick's probably were way
[38:26.860 --> 38:32.880]  worse, but I don't think, movie sets aren't fun. No. I mean, it's like, it's crunch is what it is.
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.760]  Yeah. It's like, I don't know, people, people don't, it's such a stressful environment to be in,
[38:37.880 --> 38:44.000]  whether you're fucking small potatoes or big, or big production, it's, that's a stressful way to
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.620]  make a living. High stress, but very, it's, it's always fulfilling at the end. I feel like the
[38:48.620 --> 38:52.340]  longest, the longest I worked on a film was probably two weeks. And at the end of it, I was
[38:52.340 --> 38:56.880]  just exhausted and a zombie. But I do look back on it fondly. It's like, oh, there's some stuff I
[38:56.880 --> 39:02.560]  did on, in a movie. It's exactly what Eric said. They, they're great for stories, but they suck
[39:02.560 --> 39:08.540]  to be in it. Totally. What, what movie was that? The, was that the Sherlock Holmes? Yeah. Just
[39:08.540 --> 39:12.480]  cause it had so much slow-mo. Like I only did slow-mo. So it's not like I would work on a film
[39:12.480 --> 39:18.240]  for its entire run, but there was like a two or two or three week shoot just on phantoms.
[39:18.900 --> 39:23.720]  Were you also like, if I'm just going off memory, weren't you also shooting in the snow
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.220]  somewhere out in the middle of nowhere, train stuff or something? Or was that a different movie?
[39:28.940 --> 39:32.040]  That might've been Snow White and the Huntsman, but that was fake snow.
[39:32.560 --> 39:36.980]  I just remember you being cold and miserable. No, I've definitely been cold and miserable. I
[39:36.980 --> 39:45.260]  don't know if it was for a film. I mean, England in the winter is, is that. It's cold and miserable.
[39:45.800 --> 39:54.620]  I don't, I think I've only seen Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining from Kubrick. Is, is it those
[39:54.620 --> 39:59.980]  stories or is he just remarkably good at making his whole world seem interesting? Like every
[39:59.980 --> 40:04.640]  aspect of the world that his stories take place in are things I want to explore and
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.460]  know more information about. And he does such a good job of containing what that information is.
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.120]  Yeah, there are very few true auteurs in the world. And I think he would, I think he would
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.780]  probably be one of the most successful and most prolific. He, he exerted, David Lynch like this
[40:20.780 --> 40:27.820]  too, exerted such control over every. It all feels deliberate. Every element of the, yeah,
[40:27.820 --> 40:32.900]  it does. And it is. And I think it, it takes a, probably a really unhealthy mind to be able to,
[40:33.140 --> 40:40.540]  to focus that much attention on something for that long. Like I remember, uh, I remember reading
[40:40.540 --> 40:45.060]  when Lost Highway came out, uh, which is one of my favorite David Lynch films. And I think a
[40:45.060 --> 40:53.040]  fantastic film if you can get past the bad music, um, like Rammstein and shit. Uh, but I remember
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.920]  reading before the movie came out that like David Lynch designed all the furniture in the film
[40:58.920 --> 41:03.980]  because he couldn't find, when he was trying to design Bill Pullman's house, he couldn't figure
[41:03.980 --> 41:06.920]  out, he just couldn't get it to look right. So he's like, fuck it. I'll just build all the furniture
[41:06.920 --> 41:11.460]  myself. And he's a, he's a really talented, uh, furniture maker. So he did. And I remember
[41:11.460 --> 41:14.600]  thinking like, that's fucking cool. But now when I think back and I'm like, Jesus Christ, man,
[41:14.620 --> 41:22.300]  just go to Ikea. Like. Fucking hell. My favorite Cooper thing is Barry Lyndon, which is a movie
[41:22.300 --> 41:28.200]  that I don't think a lot of people like talk about with Kubrick, but he shot it with no,
[41:28.660 --> 41:34.700]  it's a period piece and he shot it with no artificial light and had to use like special
[41:34.700 --> 41:41.020]  lenses that they had to like develop or they were used by NASA on the moon because everything was
[41:41.020 --> 41:46.020]  lit with natural light or candle. Yeah. I think it's because, and because film at the time wasn't
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.540]  incredibly sensitive. There was like, you got your F stops on lens, but he had like F
[41:51.540 --> 41:57.180]  zero point something. It was like to the point where a sliver, like a piece of fabric thickness
[41:57.180 --> 42:01.160]  of focus that you've got now. And that was on film when you couldn't even really tell if you were
[42:01.160 --> 42:07.720]  getting it. Like the film bouncing further away and towards the little, you know, lens gate would
[42:07.720 --> 42:12.900]  have affected the focus at that point. Horrendous. Crazy. I should do a deep dive on Kubrick. I've
[42:12.900 --> 42:17.140]  seen Full Metal Jacket. I've always wanted to see that. Oh my God, dude. Full Metal Jacket,
[42:17.240 --> 42:22.280]  isn't it? That is a, that is an intense. First off, I'm going to let you, it's a long ass
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.800]  fucking movie. Like it's one of those movies where the first half is, I'm not going to spoil
[42:26.800 --> 42:31.000]  anything of that film for you because it's a phenomenal movie. And it's was, it was actually
[42:31.700 --> 42:38.680]  Private Joker was influential in why I became a journalist in the army. Cause he's a, he was a
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.820]  in the Marines. The young Matthew Modine. Yeah. Matthew, Matthew Modine was like, he rubbed off
[42:43.820 --> 42:47.920]  on me and I wanted, I kind of wanted to, to be like him. Um, when I was a kid, I don't know.
[42:48.180 --> 42:50.640]  Uh, in that, I just thought that that was, if you're going to be in the military, that's a
[42:50.640 --> 42:57.260]  cool way to do it. Um, Eric said, we're a good, we're a real podcast now for white guys talking
[42:57.260 --> 43:02.540]  about how good Kubrick is. Uh, but it's like, there's like an entire film just in basic training.
[43:02.940 --> 43:06.500]  And then you think the movie's over when that's over. And then it's like, oh no, you have a whole
[43:06.500 --> 43:11.160]  other fucking film that happens. That's like a totally shifts gears. And it's just like, it's
[43:11.160 --> 43:20.100]  insane. It's intense. And Vincent D'Onofrio turns in one of the most disturbing performances you will
[43:20.100 --> 43:26.920]  ever see on film. Really? More disturbing than him in Men in Black? Yeah. He's great in Men in
[43:26.920 --> 43:33.040]  Black too. Danny Boyle is great at that. Making movies that have tonal shifts in the last act,
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.780]  but they work like train spotting shifts into like kind of a heist movie at the end. Sunshine
[43:37.780 --> 43:41.980]  becomes like a murder thriller. Like there's a real genre change in a lot of this work.
[43:42.540 --> 43:45.560]  I don't feel like Sunshine gets enough credit. That's a really great film. It's a great movie.
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.780]  Yeah. Or enough recognition, I guess. It's really good. You'd like it. It's sci-fi. It's really
[43:50.780 --> 43:55.140]  good. Yeah. I've got to catch up on space movies like Sunshine and I've never seen Event Horizon,
[43:55.340 --> 43:58.900]  which is apparently important to watch. Oh, Event Horizon, it's a good movie.
[43:59.560 --> 44:04.820]  It's yeah, it's like probably dated now, but it's a it's a scary movie too.
[44:05.060 --> 44:08.980]  Kind of. Yeah. It's a good horror movie. It's a movie podcast. You know, Wes Anderson does
[44:08.980 --> 44:13.740]  that a lot too. Where you're like, the second half of the film is a totally different movie.
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.760]  Jesus Christ. Yeah. Let's stop talking about movies.
[44:22.200 --> 44:27.200]  Because you know, there's someone listening who's seen none of those films. Or who's seen
[44:27.200 --> 44:30.120]  all of them and is like, fuck off, fuck off. You don't know what you're talking about.
[44:31.260 --> 44:34.460]  This is exciting when you watch a movie like that, like in Eyes Wide Shut. Sorry to go back
[44:34.460 --> 44:38.920]  to movies immediately. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is reading a news story about an
[44:38.920 --> 44:43.080]  event that happened in the movie. And I wanted to pause the film to read it. And I've never
[44:43.080 --> 44:49.500]  had that with a movie. It was like everything felt so detailed and was so engaging to pursue.
[44:50.400 --> 44:58.580]  Oh, speaking of movies. I don't ever really watch movies anymore. You know,
[44:58.700 --> 45:01.880]  I don't have the attention span, but my mom's in town. And so we wanted to do something last
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.200]  night. So I watched that movie, The Gray Man on Netflix. The new Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans movie.
[45:07.300 --> 45:12.360]  Have you guys seen that? No. Pretty good. Pretty good. It's kind of like a Bourne identity. They're
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.220]  saying it might be like a new big franchise where it's like Ryan Gosling plays like a Jason Bourne
[45:16.220 --> 45:20.980]  type character. And then Chris Evans is the bad guy. It's fun. Got Billy Bob Thornton in it.
[45:21.180 --> 45:24.940]  I'm walking away from this podcast with like five things to watch. Two documentaries,
[45:25.220 --> 45:28.880]  got to watch some Kubrick films. I'm walking away from this knowing that if Stanley Kubrick
[45:28.880 --> 45:34.780]  was alive, we'd still have a Choco Taco. That's my main takeaway. I'm just telling you guys,
[45:35.100 --> 45:40.020]  I'm going to be vindicated when you are seven or eight months. They're going to be like the
[45:40.020 --> 45:46.080]  back. But you demanded it. So we're bringing it back. The Choco Taco. They only took it away.
[45:46.820 --> 45:51.140]  I promise you it's only been taken away so that they can give it back to us.
[45:51.320 --> 45:55.060]  You're totally right. Like, undeniably, that's what's going to happen. I think my favorite
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.680]  one of those type stories, like Hostess went on business, somebody rebought him, brought back
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.940]  the Twinkie. I believe that's what happened with that. Chuck E. Cheese was the thing. When it
[46:05.940 --> 46:11.240]  started, it gained popularity and they were going to strike a deal with this investor.
[46:11.620 --> 46:14.820]  And they pulled out at the last minute. It was like, fuck you, we can make our own thing.
[46:15.140 --> 46:20.840]  So they started Showtime Pizza, which was like the same idea, animatronics, arcade showbiz pizza.
[46:20.940 --> 46:27.300]  Thank you. Yes, showbiz pizza. They were going to partner with Chuck E. Cheese. Then they backed
[46:27.300 --> 46:33.280]  out of the deal, made showbiz pizza. Chuck E. Cheese overextended, went bankrupt, showbiz pizza,
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.780]  then bought Chuck E. Cheese, then got rid of their own company name and called everything
[46:37.780 --> 46:42.840]  Chuck E. Cheese. So Chuck E. Cheese is really showbiz pizza now. And it's all failing. So who
[46:42.840 --> 46:46.460]  cares? But I just think it's such a wild thing of being like, fuck you, I can do it better.
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.420]  And then just absorbing the company that started it all and pretending that you're them.
[46:50.920 --> 46:56.520]  And honestly, they did. That was my childhood. I was of the era when these things came out. So
[46:56.520 --> 47:00.780]  that was like, those were birthday parties for me. Showbiz was way better than Chuck E. Cheese. Way
[47:00.780 --> 47:05.520]  better than Chuck E. Cheese. They had a much better show. The animatronic show was, the concert
[47:05.520 --> 47:10.980]  they would put on was so fucking good. What was that band called? Have you ever seen the concept
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.580]  unification video? No. It's where they're like stripping all the fur off one brand and like
[47:17.580 --> 47:21.820]  rebranding the animatronics with the other brand. And it's like an instructional video. It's like,
[47:22.200 --> 47:29.020]  now tear this piece off and shove the eyes on this one. It's gruesome. That's hideous. That
[47:29.020 --> 47:35.380]  is hideous. They were called the Rockafire Explosion. They had a, they had a fucking,
[47:35.600 --> 47:40.100]  they had a, I don't know if it was, yeah, it was, they had a gorilla in like a tuxedo who was
[47:40.100 --> 47:44.780]  fucking awesome. That's great. He played the keyboard, I think. That's fucking cool. Do you
[47:44.780 --> 47:49.240]  have anything like that growing up, Gavin? Uh, no. What about like arcades? Was there any arcade
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.700]  scene? Uh, yeah, but I lived in a really small town. I don't really have... That's fair. I mean,
[47:54.700 --> 47:59.160]  I feel like I had the similar, I had a place called Cyber City and it sucked, but that's like,
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.120]  that's what we had. Oh, there's a concept unification tape. Uh, like some VHS they sent
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.980]  to all of the locations and it's just so creepy. Was there like, cause like when I grew up,
[48:11.220 --> 48:15.480]  there were arcades in town, obviously, but you don't have access to them unless you get your
[48:15.480 --> 48:22.440]  mom to take you, which is a rarity. So like, there was like, there was a one Walmart that
[48:22.440 --> 48:30.360]  I could ride my bike to that had Street Fighter II and Ivan Iron Man's Off Road. And so those were
[48:30.360 --> 48:34.860]  my access to video games. Did you have like a gas station or something, Gav, or like a restaurant
[48:34.860 --> 48:39.220]  that just had like, like one arcade machine in the back? That like all the kids would go to? No,
[48:39.260 --> 48:47.520]  that was like a pub with a fruit machine in it though. Like a slot machine, not a vending machine
[48:47.520 --> 48:54.800]  for fruit. Fuck out of bananas again? What even is the point of this thing? So were arcade,
[48:54.940 --> 48:59.620]  arcade machines just not like popular in the UK? No, they were, it just didn't live near anything
[48:59.620 --> 49:04.600]  like that. Yeah. It's crazy to me to hear people, uh, sort of like from your generation, Geoff,
[49:04.600 --> 49:10.320]  talking about like 7-Eleven being a hangout spot cause it had a Mortal Kombat cabinet in it. Like
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.220]  that just being a place that people would hang out to play games is very interesting. Oh yeah. There
[49:14.720 --> 49:19.540]  was, uh, not a 7-Eleven, but in a different era, different place. When I lived in Florida,
[49:19.540 --> 49:28.000]  there was a Tom Thumb is what it was called there. And they had Golden Axe and, um, Altered Beast.
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.620]  And so like half the kids in town just hung out at the Tom Thumb taking turns on Golden Axe and
[49:34.620 --> 49:39.040]  Altered Beast. And that was just like, yeah, that was your access to video games back then. Yeah.
[49:39.580 --> 49:45.200]  Wild. Yeah. Let's talk of like discontinued ice cream that just made me remember one. Did you,
[49:45.200 --> 49:52.080]  did you have anything similar to, we had a, we had a Vionetta, which was like a, I would say it was
[49:52.080 --> 49:56.880]  like an ice cream lasagna thing that you like carve off slices off. Did you have anything like this?
[49:58.320 --> 50:05.560]  Dude, I had never seen or heard of the Vionetta before, but my girlfriend grew up with those.
[50:05.560 --> 50:11.640]  So we did have them in America. She said that was like, her mom would buy one of those when company
[50:11.640 --> 50:16.200]  would come over. Like that was like the fancy dessert you get when you're having, when you're
[50:16.200 --> 50:19.280]  having a dinner for like the people in the neighborhood or for your church group or
[50:19.280 --> 50:22.720]  whatever on a Sunday night. And they would pull out the Vionetta and it would be like a big
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.340]  fucking deal. Yeah. I remember it fondly of like, if it's like a Sunday dinner, but also
[50:27.920 --> 50:31.620]  some grandparents have also come over, that's when a Vionetta gets bought.
[50:32.200 --> 50:39.240]  Oh, that's great. I don't remember every Vionetta. For me, it was like the McCain deep
[50:39.240 --> 50:44.480]  and delicious cake. That was like, oh, you're at a school event. Like that is the official cake of
[50:44.480 --> 50:49.060]  any like adult run event where kids are at. Always have McCain's deep and delicious. I don't know
[50:49.060 --> 50:54.520]  if you guys have that. No, I've never heard of it. Let me see if I can find a photo. I feel like,
[50:54.540 --> 50:59.460]  I feel like it's been done to death. It's like been memed to death, but while Andrew's looking
[50:59.460 --> 51:06.320]  for that, this was my version of the Vionetta when I was a kid. We had. Yeah. Is that it? That's
[51:06.320 --> 51:12.340]  that. That's it. What is that called? It's like a McCain deep and delicious cake. But it's not.
[51:12.460 --> 51:17.020]  It's not. It's just a cake. It's just a cake. Yeah. There wasn't like an ice cream thing we had
[51:17.020 --> 51:23.580]  growing up. Fudgy the whale. Mm hmm. Fudgy the whale's great. Fudgy the whale was the shit,
[51:23.680 --> 51:27.100]  dude. That was like if you were you were lucky if your mom would get you Fudgy the whale for your
[51:27.100 --> 51:32.720]  birthday. Oh, God. That was an ice cream cake, right? Uh huh. Yeah, it's ice cream cake. We have
[51:32.720 --> 51:39.580]  so many possible food challenges to do. Like we've already got crisps ready to go.
[51:40.040 --> 51:46.460]  We can easily do ice cream. Oh, cookie puss. I remember cookie puss. You ever had a cookie
[51:46.460 --> 51:51.580]  puss, Geoff? No, I never had a cookie puss, but I'd see the commercials on TV. Oh, what is that?
[51:51.580 --> 51:59.380]  Cookie puss. Cookies for eyes and a cone for a nose. The the only reason I know what this is,
[51:59.440 --> 52:04.620]  is there was some Howard Stern fight that he got in with Fred where he was making fun of him buying
[52:04.620 --> 52:11.860]  a cookie puss and a cookie puss for like 15 minutes. And Fred is seething. And it's just
[52:11.860 --> 52:18.860]  Howard with a voice changer saying cookie puss over and over again. Fucking crying thinking about it
[52:18.860 --> 52:25.300]  is the best. It's great. But like, does this look like a like it? I feel like it's supposed to look
[52:25.300 --> 52:29.040]  like a cat or like why would his name be cookie puss? I don't know. It doesn't make sense to me.
[52:29.240 --> 52:35.580]  They're whiskers. Yeah. I don't know. I love his little hands. Oh, it looks like a tea towel
[52:35.580 --> 52:42.580]  drawing a child would make. Yeah, I think Gavin, you see his like his like his smile and then to
[52:42.580 --> 52:45.660]  the right there, the two verticals. It's like those are like little hands sticking out. Those
[52:45.660 --> 52:52.840]  are like little red gloves. How would you eat ice cream cake with a fork? No, but like what would
[52:52.840 --> 53:00.300]  you put it on? This is a real. Oh, I put it. I put it in my mouth. Great. Very helpful. Good bit.
[53:00.380 --> 53:05.280]  Yeah. Where would you put it? Well, I would always because it's cake. In my mind, I associate cake
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.640]  as a plate food. So I'd always put ice cream cake on a plate, but then it melts and becomes a mess.
[53:09.740 --> 53:14.680]  I up until like a few months ago have switched to bowls. Never even occurred to me to use a bowl.
[53:14.680 --> 53:19.360]  Ice cream is always a bowl of food, but it's a cake. So my brain would always put it at ice cream
[53:19.360 --> 53:24.000]  at kids parties. It ends up on a little plastic. It ends up on a cake. So it's but it makes no
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.680]  sense. It's a terrible ice cream should never be served on a plate. But I that's how I did it.
[53:29.140 --> 53:35.140]  I don't think kids at birthday parties let the ice cream sit long enough to it's gone in like
[53:35.140 --> 53:40.860]  point two seconds. You when you're a kid and you get up, you get birthday cake and and then if that
[53:40.860 --> 53:46.240]  birthday cake is ice cream, birthday cake, it's gone, dude. It is. It's fucking gone. There's no
[53:46.240 --> 53:50.320]  opportunity for that ice cream to melt. Eric's wife won't eat cake and ice cream together.
[53:50.640 --> 53:55.680]  Why? She doesn't like them together. She doesn't like ice cream cake. She doesn't like if there's
[53:55.680 --> 54:03.040]  cake and ice cream they can't touch. They have to be separate. Is she like that with other foods?
[54:03.420 --> 54:09.380]  Not not really. I'm sure there's one or two other things probably, but by and large, no.
[54:09.380 --> 54:15.880]  But for some reason, cake and ice cream is a very contentious thing where she is. They can't touch.
[54:16.300 --> 54:19.640]  They shouldn't ever touch. She'll eat the cake and then she'll eat the ice cream or vice versa.
[54:20.140 --> 54:28.020]  They just shouldn't be together is her feeling. I would recommend that you never dig into that
[54:28.020 --> 54:33.900]  because that kind of trauma comes from something really dark in her life. Probably this. She
[54:33.900 --> 54:38.260]  probably better just not left thinking about it. See, for me, it's a texture thing. I could see that
[54:38.260 --> 54:43.980]  being unpleasant. Those two textures not mixing. So I sponge cake. I agree. I think that's what it
[54:43.980 --> 54:48.600]  is. And I'm sorry, Gavin, like plug your ears for a second. But I think it's her. I think it's like
[54:48.600 --> 54:56.460]  a wet bread situation for her. Yeah. I think that I think that like those things are such a perfect
[54:56.460 --> 55:01.040]  pairing texturally for me. I absolutely agree. I totally agree. I'm just I'm speculating on what
[55:01.040 --> 55:04.800]  I think it might be. There are just certain things, though, that you don't like for me,
[55:04.800 --> 55:09.840]  like apples and peanut butter. I hate that. But I love them individually. Do you know if she ever
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.660]  witnessed a murder during a birthday party? Yeah, she was eating cookie puss and then she
[55:14.660 --> 55:20.820]  took a bite. A man died and that I think that might be it. It might have been a cookie opus,
[55:20.960 --> 55:26.600]  but I can't be sure. I'm sorry. What were you saying, Andrew? I don't even remember. I'm just
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.160]  now imagining a cookie puss murder. I guess we could really narrow down timing here. You're
[55:31.160 --> 55:35.640]  never getting a cookie opus outside of St. Patrick's Day. Good luck finding one. You don't
[55:35.640 --> 55:39.840]  like apples and peanut butter together? Not together. That's what I was saying. Yeah, thank
[55:39.840 --> 55:43.980]  you. That actually was what I said. I don't like them together. I enjoy them both separately. If I
[55:43.980 --> 55:47.600]  get them on a plate, I'll eat them both individually. I will not. So you'll just
[55:47.600 --> 55:53.720]  a paste. I'll just eat peanut butter by itself. Yeah. And they'll eat the apples by themself.
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.680]  But you would never dip an apple slice. I've tried like I've had it and I just don't I don't
[55:59.680 --> 56:04.440]  like it. But I like them both individually a lot. And how about caramel? We ever do like
[56:05.060 --> 56:10.160]  caramel? Yeah, that could be. Yeah. So it's not like a consistency thing. It's no, it's just
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.380]  it's like a weird. Yeah. I don't know why it's the taste doesn't blend for me. Hey, man, that's fair.
[56:14.580 --> 56:20.600]  That's fair. I get that. I had a I had a babysitter when I was a kid who was obsessed with
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.600]  eating peanut butter with Cheerios in it. And that's the only snack she would make me because
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.340]  it was the only snack she knew how to make. And she would just sit there and watch MTV and make
[56:29.340 --> 56:32.680]  me eat Cheerios and peanut butter. And she thought it was the best thing ever.
[56:33.180 --> 56:38.880]  What? So how would that work? She just don't. She would dump a bunch of peanut butter in a bowl
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.360]  and then put Cheerios on top of it and then give me a spoon. That's a terrible treat. And then
[56:43.360 --> 56:46.740]  she would eat it, too. And it wasn't like a torture because she was eating it, too. Did you
[56:46.740 --> 56:50.900]  like it? It doesn't sound that bad, actually. Well, what type of Cheerios? Are we talking like a
[56:50.900 --> 56:56.940]  honey nut? Are we talking a base Cheerio? This is like 1986. So we're talking straight ass Cheerios.
[56:56.940 --> 57:02.960]  Okay. I'll eat Cheerios and peanut butter from time to time. I just think it's insane to say
[57:02.960 --> 57:08.100]  that she made it for you and that it's the only thing she knew how to make. Yeah, this is all I
[57:08.100 --> 57:15.300]  can get. Peanut butter and Cheerios. Nothing's being made. So what, you eat that? Do I? Yeah.
[57:15.360 --> 57:20.260]  Yeah. Yeah. You get like a spoonful of peanut butter and like not like full, but like a little
[57:20.260 --> 57:23.180]  bit of peanut butter and then like some Cheerios. It's like a nice like little quick snack.
[57:24.400 --> 57:31.760]  You, you and my babysitter in 1986 are the only people I've ever met that participate.
[57:32.080 --> 57:38.840]  Well, we're both chefs. I have no idea. What is the base Cheerio? Is it the one
[57:38.840 --> 57:43.160]  Cheerio with the different types? What's the one with like three different Cheerio types?
[57:43.600 --> 57:47.560]  The base Cheerio is the one with three different Cheerios in it.
[57:48.180 --> 57:54.400]  So wait, that's because I only remember that one and Honey Nut Cheerio. What were the three
[57:54.400 --> 57:59.520]  flavors? I'm not even familiar with what that is. What are you talking about? That was that
[57:59.520 --> 58:04.580]  like this, like the white Cheerio. And there's like the brown one. Excuse me? You're asking
[58:04.580 --> 58:08.920]  again. You're asking if the base Cheerio is three different kinds of Cheerios.
[58:09.300 --> 58:13.640]  This was like the bog standard Cheerio. Was it? It was like the song was like
[58:14.280 --> 58:16.920]  Cheerio, it's cheery corn. What?
[58:20.460 --> 58:27.580]  What's happening? You are rolling in snack attack once again, like it's an experience we all have.
[58:27.700 --> 58:31.960]  This is some crazy British shit. What are you talking about? Hold on, Cheerio. I was wondering
[58:31.960 --> 58:38.560]  why I haven't seen them in a while. There's a song? Yeah, it's something something Cheerio.
[58:41.260 --> 58:46.840]  Cheerio is so good to eat. That was the song. So good. Now let me find a Gavin.
[58:47.600 --> 58:51.100]  Geoff, you've been around longer than all of us. Have you ever heard the Cheerio song?
[58:51.560 --> 58:56.480]  No, no, no, no. I've also never heard of white. Was it white and wheat?
[58:58.920 --> 59:04.800]  Did you call one of them cheery oats? Something like that. He did. Like this is
[59:04.800 --> 59:09.820]  standard Cheerios, right? Oh, I think that's it. That's Cheerios. Does it?
[59:10.040 --> 59:14.700]  Here we go. Yeah, look, look at this. Look at this freaking ad. It wasn't. Oh, it said
[59:14.700 --> 59:19.320]  a thing. I think it was cheery wheat. I'm watching this cheery wheat. It was.
[59:21.740 --> 59:28.620]  This is nutritious. This is trying to be so American.
[59:30.080 --> 59:38.720]  Dude, what? But you guys are. This is the UK trying to be so American by eating non-American
[59:38.720 --> 59:43.460]  Cheerios. So I think they're all the same, but they've they just listed the four things. So
[59:43.460 --> 59:48.440]  maybe that's why. No, I don't think so, dude, because they those are different colors in the.
[59:48.760 --> 59:54.140]  Yeah, they were definitely different colors in the spoon. So to me, that's the bog standard
[59:54.140 --> 59:59.620]  Cheerio. And then you've got the honey nut Cheerios. So what you just had like Cheerios.
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.500]  I put the picture above it. You see, like when they show like the four colors and there's like
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:10.660]  the really beige one, that's Cheerios. That's Cheerios. Just plain as Cheerios. What you're
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.660]  describing, we have a version of that in America. It's called Chex. So we have there's like rice
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:21.100]  Chex and corn Chex and wheat Chex. And there's no like bog standard Chex because they're all
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:26.280]  different flavors. But yeah, Cheerios is just it's just that yellow ass box that's above it right
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.800]  there. Those those strawberries in the bowl, those don't come with it. Those are add ons.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.820]  There's so many of these. That's must be I remember the song is because that was
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.600]  why I kind of barely remembered the song, but I just remember there was a song because it was
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.960]  there's so many different years where they played that sort of shit.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:52.760]  These are terrible. It is very American. Corn, rice, oats, wheat. I can't even find that product.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:58.280]  It's all like amber waves of grain and people jumping in a lake and like
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:06.340]  wow. We just had such similar but different lives.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.800]  Here's the Cheerios commercial I remember when I was a kid. Let's see this. Toasted oat cereal.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.920]  Oh, this is cool. Yours is animated. Yeah, it's Jack and the Beanstalk. It went into his bicep.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:32.040]  I got toast. Boom. That's the shit right there. Andrew, how do they advertise Cheerios in Canada?
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:37.180]  That's the Canadian Cheerio. I don't remember. I just feel like it was kids eating cereal. Like
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:41.720]  I don't think we had animation or a cool song. I don't remember anything like that.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.440]  Cheerios commercial. I'm looking. Oh, here we go. Canadian ad Cheerios. I stepped away
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.200]  from Cheerios knowing the ingredients. Here, I have not seen this. This is just
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:59.200]  listed as a Canadian ad Cheerios. This is so fucking bland. Yeah, like Cheerios. Like Canada.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.700]  Like Canadians must be the most patient people in the world because my god, that was just like
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.260]  the slowest commercial I've ever seen in my life. It's just sad. That was a 30 second seminar on why
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:16.900]  Cheerios don't have any flavor. Yeah, that one's definitely marketed at the moms, not the kids.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:22.580]  Yeah. I like the final five seconds of we got to do something. Explode the fucking box. Let's
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:27.900]  have them all fall in the milk at once. Like we did anything. We need anything. This stinks.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.120]  It's like Michael Mixture at the end did a bunch of Cheerios just fly into that woman's bicep.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.100]  It's like they had Michael Bay for two seconds of footage.
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:44.160]  Like that's all they could book. Well, I think it was Stanley Kubrick for the first half.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:51.860]  Do you know how many times it took for them to pour that bowl of cereal? 800 takes. I gotta be
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:57.800]  honest. After watching the three, I feel a little ripped off. I think you had so many flavors in
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.600]  your Cheerios. Yeah. I want to try British Cheerios now. I want to hear from other people from
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.840]  England because I may have just missed it. But was there a bog standard plain single Cheerio that
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:14.000]  wasn't Honey Nut? Do let me know in the comments. Become a comment leaver if you feel like this is
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.820]  worth doing so. I'm excited. It's gonna have to happen eventually. It might as well be about
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:25.800]  Cheerios. It's true. Well, it's like infection in Halo. We're all gonna get infected as a comment
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.340]  leaver at some point. So you might as well just accept it. We should start selling like
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:36.000]  comment leaver care packages. Like a little relief package for when you finally make the decision.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.040]  Do you remember we talked about a long time ago having an official face apology basket that we
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:51.040]  gave to people? Yeah, the guilt basket. We got to get on that. We really need to design and build
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.820]  a physical guilt basket that we can give out to people. I think that'd be very funny. I'll start
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:04:01.640]  on the basket. And it would have, I gotta think it's got British Cheerios in it. Like a little
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.840]  travel size British Cheerios. Did you guys have that in England? Did you have like the little one
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.720]  size, like one, uh, like one portion size? Yeah. It had all the different types of Kellogg's.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:17.880]  Yeah. You had like Frosted Flakes. And no one ever ate the rice-icles. Rice-icles? Uh,
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.560]  nobody knows what you're talking about. How do we keep getting so close and then you say something
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:30.160]  that's so like fucking bizarre, it just stops. You never had rice-icles? Rice-icles? Are you
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.520]  talking about Rice Krispies? It has to be. We had Rice Krispies, but we also had... What the fuck?
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.440]  Rice-icles? It's just, I'm looking at it. It's a Rice Krispie. No, no, you're wrong. It isn't.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:46.680]  And this will be a part of our cereal gauntlet. How is it different? They look identical.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:53.360]  They're more like... Hmm. They're definitely different. They don't taste anything like
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.940]  Rice Krispies. Captain Rick? This is wild. But anyway, in the big multi-pack, it would always
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:05.080]  be like people will be scarfing down the Crunchy Nut and the Cocoa Pops, but Rice-icles would always
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.880]  be left in the end of the bag. So they're just not good? I just don't think it was anyone's
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.400]  favorite. The Frosties would be sucked down immediately. I assume that's Frosted Flakes?
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.080]  Frosties? Yeah, it's Frosties for us. Oh yeah. Did you guys have Tony the Tiger? You did? Yeah,
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.000]  yeah, yeah. Yeah. Do you guys call him Tony the Tiger, or did he have a different name in England?
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:29.360]  No, he was probably like Anthony. He's not like Anthony the Hero or anything?
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.680]  What the fuck's a Honey Loop? I don't know. I think this is a more modern version,
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:39.880]  because I don't remember multigrain shapes or Honey Loops. I remember Rice-icles being in there,
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:47.240]  though. Huh. Honey Loop? Is that like a honey-o? I don't know. Oh yeah, it does. It looks just
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:53.500]  like a honey-o. Okay. Except honey-o's are post. We're an old food podcast. We're a breakfast
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:06:03.800]  food podcast. All right, you got your Weet-O's and your Shred-E's. You say shit like it's real,
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:11.420]  and it's the most insane stuff I've ever heard. It's real. Weet-O's and Shred-E's. Shred-E's
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:20.700]  look like chicks. And then you got your Weetabix and your Shredded Wheat. It's all in there. It's
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:27.460]  insane. I'm just looking through cereal on Google Images, and I don't know what's real or what's
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.960]  fake, and I don't know what you know. This is just terrible. So Shred-E is just rice chicks. God,
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:40.680]  it's so wild. Crunchy nut must be honey bunches of oats. Don't even get me started on the Milky Way.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:47.520]  Oh, that's right. That's a whole thing. It's a whole thing. And Smarties. And Smarties. Yeah,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.700]  I have those. That's also Canadian. Which one? Smarties and Milky Way, I believe. Which one do
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:57.400]  you have? Which one's Smartie? The chocolate. Smarties are chocolate to me, and what you guys
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:04.480]  Americans call Smarties, we call Rockets. Was Tony the Tiger the mascot for Ricicles? What's this
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:10.740]  betrayal? No, wait. It says Frosties on the side. Yeah, then why does it say Ricicles on the front?
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.180]  Well, I'll be honest, Eric. It looks like someone's taped that on. Okay. Yeah.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.720]  I've never seen that box. That's a little bit before my time. That looks wrong. Wait,
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:29.700]  was... did he get promoted from Ricicles to Frosties? The career progression of Tony the Tiger.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.420]  Was he a Ricicles guy? This is blowing my mind. Insane. He definitely... he's definitely grown.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:44.800]  He looks a lot different today than he did in 1977. I wonder if Ricicles were as great as
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.760]  Frosties, or if he had a different catchphrase. What is happening?
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.800]  Tony the Tiger, 1977. There was a kangaroo?
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.620]  Katie the Kangaroo.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:01.600]  Is this like Australian Frosties had a kangaroo? Or did they swap?
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.940]  I feel unwell. I think it sounds like the kangaroo got fired. They promoted Tony up.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.640]  Yeah. And then they hired Rick to take over Ricicles.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.040]  So I'm reading the history. I'm gonna look it up.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.880]  They had other characters named Elmo the Elephant and Newt the New. Within the year,
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:20.920]  the other mascots were dropped, with Elmo and Newt never once gracing the front of the box.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.220]  They were never used. Tony was given a son? Tony Jr? Tony has a kid?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.240]  Yeah, Tony has a kid. There's a small tiger. I didn't know that.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.260]  Yeah. Does he also work on Frosties?
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.600]  I'm trying to, uh... There he is.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.460]  Good God. Yeah.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.060]  So... We're a cereal history podcast.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.800]  Do you guys have Golden Crisp, then?
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.660]  Post a picture of that. It might have a different name.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.860]  Like, can't get enough of Super Golden Crisp. It's got... crunch with punch.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.500]  It's got, like, a really cool bear.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.960]  Yeah, that's him right there. The Golden Crisp.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.440]  I can't see any of the cereal. Oh!
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.140]  Oh, sorry.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.500]  Honey Smacks looks like Sugar Puffs. With the honey monster.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.000]  I'm sorry, the what?
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:02.820]  The honey monster.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.100]  What? The honey monster?
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.200]  Yeah, you ever Sugar Puffs? Hold on.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.680]  I don't know what a honey monster is.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.360]  I'll show you. The honey monster was the mascot...
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:12.960]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.960]  What the fuck?
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.220]  This... Is this real?
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:19.980]  Yes. That's Sugar Puffs.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.720]  And the honey monster, he'd be like, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, and he'd stuff in...
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.480]  No! I don't want to...
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.380]  He'd stuff them in.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.060]  The honey monster's a fever dream.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.240]  I don't like this.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.880]  That looks like Honey Smacks, doesn't it?
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.000]  Yeah, he was...
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.080]  What?
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:35.360]  Dude, he was always scoffing Sugar Puffs.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:35.880]  What? No!
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.620]  What is happening?
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.780]  No! We need to end this. We need to stop.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.220]  That's an idiot! Oh, stop!
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.680]  Dude, that's just a part of my life. You're just laughing at the honey monster.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.660]  We need to end this.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.900]  How do you... How did you sleep at night as a kid?
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.640]  Is that even James Bond?
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.500]  This is fucking derogatory.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.020]  That's a British icon you're talking about right there.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.000]  Oh, how did he sleep at night?
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.700]  Why, he slept with the honey monster, of course.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:13.900]  Honestly, a Sugar Puff was so gross. If you got one just mildly wet, you could just wet your hand
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:18.020]  and put your hand in the bowl and they would all stick to you. The sugar would immediately stick.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.040]  It was the stickiest cereal.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.760]  Oh, man.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.500]  Okay, we should end, but here's the last picture.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.440]  Oh, God. That's our fucking... That's the cover to this album. Good Lord.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.580]  All right, well, we got to... I was...
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:40.380]  This could go on literally for hours because I have a bunch of new...
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.620]  I have like 20 other cereals queued up to check out.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.800]  So we should probably stop while we're ahead.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:49.620]  I will just say, though, Super Golden Crisp was fucking awesome and Sugar Bear was a good mascot.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:50.840]  I still like that.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:51.140]  Oh, no.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.960]  They renamed Sugar Puffs.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.280]  I guess because they're trying to get sugar out of the name because no one's buying it.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.240]  Now they're called Honey Monster Puffs.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.140]  Oh, my God, that's worse.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.420]  That's so much worse.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.480]  Yeah, that's not a good change.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.800]  I didn't actually know that.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.800]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.520]  Okay, did someone end this thing?
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:17.340]  Well, yeah, thanks for tuning in to episode 115 of The Breakfast Cereal Podcast.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.840]  I hope you learned a little something about the differences in cultures,
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.480]  yet we're still able to come together, even across
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:33.300]  the oceans of water and wildly disparate cereal mascots.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.020]  It is...
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.640]  I'm going to be thinking about...
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.440]  What is this guy's name again?
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.280]  The Honey Monster.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.620]  Honey Monster, yeah.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.080]  That's just gross.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.380]  All right, well, see you next time.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.540]  What is Jack going to do with this chat?
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.460]  Hey, guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.780]  episode of F*** Face.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.500]  Someone is three hours late.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.580]  It's the most dangerous episode ever.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960]  We need some gloves.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.020]  What is the worst Cheetos flavor?
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.060]  Geoff is all kinds of swollen.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.880]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.800]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
