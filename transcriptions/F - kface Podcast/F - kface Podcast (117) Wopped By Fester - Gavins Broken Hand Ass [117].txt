[00:14.500 --> 00:20.820]  Let me ask you a question, Andrew. Tito Ortiz. How old do you think Tito Ortiz is right now?
[00:21.020 --> 00:27.280]  Whoa, that's weird because he's a sports guy, so when you hit 32, you're viewed as ancient.
[00:27.640 --> 00:34.480]  Which you have to apply a different... I'm going to guess that Tito Ortiz is probably in his early 40s, like 42.
[00:34.880 --> 00:35.780]  Is he still fighting?
[00:35.780 --> 00:44.360]  Sort of. He was the head of... Oscar De La Hoya did an MMA event with him and Chuck Liddell that was a disaster.
[00:44.780 --> 00:50.180]  I don't think he's fought since then and it closed like it was such a bad event that it kind of bankrupted De La Hoya.
[00:50.900 --> 00:55.600]  At least that's what he said. So he's sort of fighting, but not really. He used to be a politician.
[00:56.100 --> 01:02.360]  He went in largely off of Trump and then he got thrown out after eight months for... I think he was Huntington Beach.
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.140]  I watched a 30-30, I believe it was, on that fight you're talking about with him and Chuck Liddell and what a loss it was for them.
[01:09.700 --> 01:16.460]  I looked it up. He's 47 years old. By the way, welcome to the F*** Face Podcast, Geoff Gavin Andrew.
[01:17.660 --> 01:21.340]  He's 47 years old, so he's actually the same age as me, which was shocking.
[01:21.920 --> 01:27.260]  But I was wondering, how old do you think Tito Ortiz would have to be?
[01:27.260 --> 01:34.960]  You're your age right now, which is what, 26 or so? 28. So you're 28 years old. Tito Ortiz is 47.
[01:35.360 --> 01:42.460]  There is no way in which we put you and Tito Ortiz in a room together to fight that he doesn't kill you pretty quickly.
[01:42.480 --> 01:44.340]  Oh, murders me. Yeah, within a minute.
[01:44.340 --> 01:48.660]  But how old does he have to be before you've got a shot, do you think?
[01:50.460 --> 01:54.500]  Year 28, could a 60-year-old Tito Ortiz kick your ass? Probably.
[01:55.440 --> 01:59.680]  But could a 70-year-old Tito Ortiz kick your ass? I don't know.
[02:00.280 --> 02:06.960]  I don't think a 60... because you need to put Tito Ortiz is an MMA fighter, so him at 60 is like 120.
[02:07.660 --> 02:11.260]  Like, his body is so f***ed. I think I could do 60, but that is the cutoff.
[02:11.740 --> 02:14.840]  How old is Arnold Schwarzenegger? That's a great question. He's got to be 70.
[02:14.840 --> 02:18.960]  I'd guess like 72. I'm sure he could kick the piss out of Andrew still.
[02:19.640 --> 02:21.180]  I agree. I would not.
[02:21.180 --> 02:24.280]  Do you think, yeah, at what age do you think you could beat up Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[02:24.380 --> 02:26.960]  He's 72 now, we all agree he would beat your ass.
[02:27.460 --> 02:29.960]  He's 75. He's 75. 75.
[02:30.340 --> 02:34.960]  Jesus. I would say 85. I feel confident.
[02:35.640 --> 02:39.520]  Do you think because your back is longer, it has more chance of breaking?
[02:41.740 --> 02:48.840]  That's an interesting question. If I'm on the bottom, I'm doing bottom control, I don't know. That'd be tough.
[02:49.440 --> 02:50.100]  What do you mean the bottom?
[02:50.100 --> 02:55.520]  Oh, I'm saying like if he takes me down, right, then if you're looking for like submissions...
[02:56.080 --> 02:58.540]  Yeah, I'm thinking like mixed martial arts, like jiu-jitsu.
[02:58.900 --> 03:02.860]  I don't know if having a long back is a disadvantage because I don't have long legs.
[03:03.020 --> 03:07.480]  That definitely is what you want. You're open up for triangles and sweeps and...
[03:07.480 --> 03:11.860]  Nick's got a good point. You'd have to break his punches, block the punches with your nose.
[03:12.020 --> 03:13.540]  That's true. That frees up my hands.
[03:13.780 --> 03:18.900]  You've got a secret weapon. Do you think his wrist and fist will break before your nose does?
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.740]  Because maybe that's a tactic right there.
[03:20.820 --> 03:26.420]  I think you just unlocked this. It's not at what age can I beat up Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[03:26.560 --> 03:29.840]  It's at what age will his body disintegrate trying to fight me?
[03:30.220 --> 03:36.580]  It's really not about me. It's we're waiting for the point in which he will just crumble at any movement.
[03:36.580 --> 03:37.820]  That's what I need.
[03:38.500 --> 03:38.980]  Disintegrate.
[03:40.460 --> 03:47.000]  Well, if you, audience member, if you have access to Arnold Schwarzenegger or Tito Ortiz
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.520]  and are interested in having either of them fight Andrew at some point in their geriatric days,
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.780]  let us know. See if you can help facilitate this.
[03:55.200 --> 03:58.620]  85-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger versus Andrew, I would pay 100 bucks to see that.
[03:58.820 --> 04:03.180]  I feel like the Schwarzenegger thing is so out of the realm of possibility,
[04:03.180 --> 04:06.680]  but I worry because the Tito Ortiz thing...
[04:06.680 --> 04:07.880]  No, it's very possible.
[04:08.180 --> 04:16.700]  It feels like for $1,500 and just being in the same place he is, you could get Tito Ortiz to fight someone.
[04:17.040 --> 04:21.000]  Alright, yeah, but not for 13 more years. He's only 40. He's gotta hit 60.
[04:22.040 --> 04:27.240]  Can I read my favorite Tito Ortiz nonsensical quote? Like this is trash talk that he did.
[04:27.360 --> 04:28.700]  This is word for word what he said.
[04:28.700 --> 04:32.940]  Jealous of him? This guy can't even put a fucking sentence together, man.
[04:33.220 --> 04:37.220]  You kidding me right now? He's reaching for... he's reaching for those grapes.
[04:37.540 --> 04:43.360]  He's trying to make his wine and the wine is already singing, sounding like violin, with that cheese and that wine.
[04:43.680 --> 04:45.080]  We'll see on November 24th.
[04:45.700 --> 04:47.680]  What the fuck does that mean?
[04:48.060 --> 04:49.900]  What was the wine in that analogy?
[04:50.180 --> 04:57.300]  I don't know! And you should hear him do it because it's so much slower and like him trying to... it's a mess, he's a mess.
[04:57.300 --> 05:01.880]  It sounded like he was trying to say that he couldn't make the wine, but the wine was already singing.
[05:02.120 --> 05:09.520]  Yeah, I feel like he mixed so many metaphors at once and like he's trying to do a violin thing. It's just a disaster of a clip.
[05:09.960 --> 05:15.420]  You know how they refer to people as punch drunk? It's essentially, I guess, CTE, right?
[05:15.500 --> 05:17.140]  It's kind of what we were talking about with Antonio Brown earlier.
[05:18.260 --> 05:21.900]  You just get hit enough times in your life that you're just loopy from then on out.
[05:22.940 --> 05:23.860]  Traumatic brain damage.
[05:23.860 --> 05:29.380]  Yeah, but do you wonder if it's like, oh, they just got hit in the head so many times they're slow?
[05:29.560 --> 05:35.220]  Or do you think a person can only can get punched so many times that they're just always ready for a punch?
[05:35.280 --> 05:38.520]  And any time they're taught like, like maybe he's not mentally slow.
[05:38.620 --> 05:42.180]  Maybe he just speaks slowly because he's just like always on guard.
[05:42.420 --> 05:44.360]  He's just like he's like for the rest of his life.
[05:44.360 --> 05:47.780]  He's going to be waiting for a punch to come at any moment in his life.
[05:48.140 --> 05:48.680]  You know what I mean?
[05:49.220 --> 05:54.060]  Do you think so? Or do you think it's the other way when if you know how to fight, you're not as worried about it?
[05:54.400 --> 05:58.180]  Like if somebody tries to make a move, you have a confidence that like, oh, I'll deal with them.
[05:58.240 --> 05:58.600]  It's no problem.
[05:58.740 --> 06:04.780]  I definitely, I definitely went into my fifth root canal a different man than I went into my second.
[06:05.360 --> 06:06.040]  I'll say that.
[06:06.680 --> 06:07.840]  Yeah, so it's like...
[06:07.840 --> 06:09.060]  Because I'd had a thousand. Yeah.
[06:09.300 --> 06:10.900]  So you do learn to take a punch.
[06:11.120 --> 06:13.900]  Well, how many times, Geoff, how many times have people punched you in the head or face?
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.320]  In my life?
[06:16.960 --> 06:21.180]  Because didn't you get like a fist straight down on the top of your head once?
[06:21.760 --> 06:23.800]  What? Oh, I got...
[06:23.800 --> 06:26.740]  Oh, when that Fester...
[06:27.980 --> 06:30.480]  I always get mixed up between Fester and Porch.
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.640]  I got hit on the head by Fester.
[06:32.860 --> 06:34.740]  I ran from, well, I ran from both of them.
[06:34.960 --> 06:37.520]  I got hit on the head by Fester because he caught me.
[06:38.680 --> 06:40.660]  I did not get caught by Porch.
[06:42.620 --> 06:47.360]  Dude, it's bad enough to get whopped on the head like a cartoon by a guy named Fester.
[06:47.960 --> 06:50.440]  You do not want to get hit by a guy named Porch.
[06:50.480 --> 06:53.500]  A guy named Porch has the name Porch for very specific reasons.
[06:55.780 --> 06:57.620]  Yeah, that's a great name.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.180]  You don't want to fuck with Porch.
[06:59.320 --> 07:04.340]  Porch is like a background character in like Roadhouse is the vibe I get from Porch.
[07:04.940 --> 07:07.500]  Yeah, Porch is the, he's the size of a literal porch.
[07:07.740 --> 07:09.120]  Yeah, if my memory serves.
[07:10.520 --> 07:17.420]  I've probably been in, you know, it's funny because you brought up two fights I would completely forgotten about and I wouldn't have counted, Gavin.
[07:17.620 --> 07:21.740]  I've probably been in 10, 12 fights in my life, maybe.
[07:22.840 --> 07:23.680]  Maybe a few more.
[07:23.680 --> 07:24.320]  Where you got hit?
[07:24.820 --> 07:25.700]  Where I got hit, yeah.
[07:25.780 --> 07:28.240]  And were the early ones a lot worse than the later ones?
[07:30.120 --> 07:32.540]  All fights suck in the exact same way to me.
[07:32.860 --> 07:33.100]  Okay.
[07:33.540 --> 07:36.100]  I mean, I never, I never suffered catastrophic injuries.
[07:36.100 --> 07:41.560]  I never got like, I got jumped in the army once by 13 Marines.
[07:41.740 --> 07:43.920]  I think I've told that story, maybe on other podcasts.
[07:44.180 --> 07:45.940]  Did you get like soap in the sock?
[07:46.160 --> 07:47.180]  Like what was going on?
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.840]  No, I never got, I never got that.
[07:48.900 --> 07:49.560]  So what happened?
[07:49.780 --> 07:55.580]  So what had happened was, what happened was I was at a place called the Defense Information School in the army.
[07:55.680 --> 07:57.020]  It was in Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana.
[07:57.160 --> 07:57.940]  It's no longer there.
[07:58.260 --> 08:00.240]  It moved to Maryland.
[08:00.460 --> 08:01.240]  Not that it matters.
[08:01.660 --> 08:04.440]  But if you're from Indiana and you're like, I've never heard of Fort Ben Harrison.
[08:04.620 --> 08:05.480]  I live in Indianapolis.
[08:05.480 --> 08:07.280]  That's because it's gone, but it used to be there.
[08:07.320 --> 08:07.780]  And I was there.
[08:08.300 --> 08:11.700]  And so that school, it was, it was a joint school.
[08:11.820 --> 08:14.080]  So it means it was a, it was a rarity in the military.
[08:14.260 --> 08:16.040]  They mean, it means it was the journalism school, right?
[08:16.520 --> 08:17.660]  Journalism and broadcast school.
[08:18.320 --> 08:26.980]  So they taught all soldiers, Marines, Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard the same curriculum.
[08:26.980 --> 08:28.120]  So there were mixed classes.
[08:28.120 --> 08:31.960]  So I had classes with Marines and Air Force and all those guys and girls.
[08:32.440 --> 08:34.220]  And it was one of the only schools in the army like that.
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.240]  And so we shared barracks.
[08:36.960 --> 08:40.040]  And my, like the army boys were on the first floor.
[08:40.300 --> 08:42.100]  And then the Marines had the second floor.
[08:42.540 --> 08:44.760]  And then I want to say the Air Force had the...
[08:44.760 --> 08:48.480]  The Marines and the Air Force and the Navy maybe had the third floor.
[08:48.820 --> 08:51.880]  And then I think the Air Force had their own accommodations because they were so fucking fancy.
[08:52.460 --> 08:54.640]  And then the fourth floor was like the army ladies.
[08:54.900 --> 08:59.200]  And then maybe some other ladies from other, other branches too.
[08:59.520 --> 09:00.820]  I think it might have just been like the ladies floor.
[09:00.820 --> 09:12.120]  So anyway, one, what would happen when you were called short time, which is when you're graduating and you're, you're moving off to go start your duty somewhere once you graduate your school.
[09:12.780 --> 09:14.820]  Assuming you didn't wash out like most people.
[09:15.460 --> 09:17.340]  You, there were traditions you would do.
[09:17.420 --> 09:24.400]  Like one of the traditions was the, you would take buckets of water and you would run around to the other people that were in the class before you.
[09:24.480 --> 09:27.900]  And you would throw the water under their door and like flood their bedroom.
[09:28.480 --> 09:36.520]  So I was doing that one night because as, because I passed the goddamn journalism school and it was my right to do it because I spent six fucking months at that school.
[09:36.700 --> 09:43.140]  And I absolutely deserve to throw the water under the door like everybody else got to do with the history of the Defense Information School.
[09:43.500 --> 09:45.720]  Uh, but it's certainly a big fucking deal when Geoff does it.
[09:47.160 --> 09:50.800]  Uh, it was a big deal because I went on the wrong floor.
[09:50.940 --> 09:52.040]  I did it on the Marine floor.
[09:52.040 --> 09:58.280]  And the problem was the Marines who went to the journalism school weren't the only Marines there.
[09:58.460 --> 10:00.160]  There were also Marines who did other jobs.
[10:01.020 --> 10:03.480]  I think these guys worked for like the Marine post office or something.
[10:04.200 --> 10:04.600]  Honestly.
[10:04.980 --> 10:07.080]  And uh, don't fuck with the Marine post office.
[10:08.200 --> 10:15.360]  Uh, and so they, there was a batch of dudes that had just been there for like a, they had just processed in.
[10:15.440 --> 10:16.560]  So they'd been there like four or five days.
[10:16.700 --> 10:18.100]  They didn't know what the fuck was going on.
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.440]  They didn't know the rules of the land.
[10:19.440 --> 10:35.000]  So when some hundred and forty pounds, six foot tall scrawny soldier is running gleefully down their hallway screaming and laughing and giggling and filling up a water bucket in a, in a water fountain and then throwing it under people's doors.
[10:35.300 --> 10:37.020]  Uh, they didn't have a sense of humor for that.
[10:37.400 --> 10:39.460]  And so about, it was 13 of them.
[10:39.800 --> 10:46.160]  I remember, uh, grabbed me and they punched me around a little bit, but what really hurt was they threw me down a flight of stairs.
[10:46.280 --> 10:47.820]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[10:48.420 --> 10:48.660]  Yeah.
[10:49.020 --> 10:54.040]  And then when I got to the, when I hit the ground, I was going like backwards in slow motion and they were looking at me.
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.560]  And by the time I hit the ground, they also went down the stairs to continue to kick me.
[10:58.860 --> 11:03.500]  And then eventually, I remember thinking like, well, at least I'm falling away from them.
[11:03.720 --> 11:06.320]  And then by the time I hit the ground, I was like, oh, and I knocked my breath out.
[11:06.360 --> 11:08.520]  And I was like, oh, why are their boots still here?
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.980]  Uh, but, uh, very, very quickly after that, uh, somebody came and broke it up before I got seriously hurt.
[11:15.980 --> 11:18.320]  That's the closest I ever got to getting like really damaged in a fight.
[11:18.560 --> 11:26.060]  I just, I can't stop thinking about how wanting, like needing to call for help at defense information is like the worst location.
[11:26.440 --> 11:29.820]  There's no more embarrassing place to be than the need help.
[11:30.020 --> 11:31.120]  Oh my God, dude.
[11:31.680 --> 11:38.220]  Not only that, but you know that thing where you're doing something with your friends and then you turn around and all your friends are gone, like just completely gone.
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.760]  They're just like little clouds of smoke where they used to be and suddenly it's you versus the entire United States Marine Corps.
[11:44.160 --> 11:46.660]  Well, the United States Marine Post Office Corps.
[11:46.920 --> 11:49.080]  It's a very specific...
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.040]  I could be misremembering that, but I think, I think that's what it was.
[11:52.100 --> 11:54.000]  I think they were going to like a postal training or something.
[11:54.460 --> 11:56.600]  They were definitely, they definitely went postal on me.
[11:57.140 --> 11:57.760]  God damn.
[11:58.300 --> 11:59.120]  Uh, how about you, Gav?
[11:59.440 --> 12:01.100]  Getting, uh, smacked in the head?
[12:01.440 --> 12:02.660]  Yeah, how many times have you been hit in a fight?
[12:03.280 --> 12:05.300]  Uh, I mean, no, no serious fights.
[12:05.320 --> 12:07.460]  Like we had like friend fights where I got punched.
[12:07.820 --> 12:08.480]  Yeah, of course.
[12:08.760 --> 12:10.900]  Uh, yeah, but nothing that like rocked me.
[12:10.900 --> 12:15.840]  I think my, most of my head injuries have just been like standing up in a cupboard too fast and stuff.
[12:16.580 --> 12:22.140]  You never got, you never got like just in a fight at lunch at school with some other kid who was just like, I don't know.
[12:22.600 --> 12:24.900]  I'm just going to try to use some British slang, but I don't have any.
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.320]  Was there some, some dude who was a proper wanker?
[12:29.420 --> 12:30.420]  No, I got, I got bundled.
[12:31.420 --> 12:34.440]  Some chav who was giving you the bad stuff?
[12:35.040 --> 12:37.220]  Yeah, like a big, like a big dog pile.
[12:37.840 --> 12:40.960]  But it, but you know, to a scale where like the whole school comes.
[12:41.440 --> 12:42.640]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:42.820 --> 12:45.340]  You try to throw a bucket of water through the door? What did you do?
[12:45.460 --> 12:48.120]  How did this result in you being the sole target?
[12:48.640 --> 12:55.820]  Uh, well, usually it was, it started when like people would be playing football at lunch and all the, all the backpacks would be in a big pile.
[12:56.180 --> 12:58.580]  And sometimes you would just get chucked into the middle.
[12:58.580 --> 13:03.100]  And then the person who chucked you shouts bundle. Everyone stops playing football.
[13:03.340 --> 13:05.840]  People come running out of buildings and swarming the field.
[13:05.980 --> 13:09.660]  And suddenly you're trying to get out of there before too many people land on you.
[13:09.720 --> 13:15.780]  But sometimes, you know, you've got like 17 people on top and you're just, you're like, and you're like trying to push people out of the way.
[13:15.820 --> 13:18.820]  And then you take a knee to the head and then you just have to go fetal until it subsides.
[13:19.020 --> 13:19.960]  I had a few of those.
[13:20.240 --> 13:20.980]  That's a great game.
[13:21.320 --> 13:22.260]  They were always fun though.
[13:22.260 --> 13:29.260]  It was always, it was always like really epic and scary to see like 50 to 60 kids running towards you about to dive on you.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.640]  I remember watching my friend, happened to my friend once and he, he tried to get out early.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.520]  Like he, it was pre, the bundle call hadn't been cool, but he knew it was coming.
[13:39.860 --> 13:41.780]  So he was just like leaping over all the bags.
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.500]  He'd somehow ended up in the middle, but he got his ankle like hooked on someone's strap and he was just really strong.
[13:47.620 --> 13:49.300]  It was like he was in quicksand of bags.
[13:49.300 --> 13:52.200]  And then suddenly like people started coming in from the sides.
[13:52.320 --> 13:53.260]  It was like a zombie movie.
[13:53.780 --> 13:56.080]  And he was somehow able to stay on top.
[13:56.180 --> 14:00.340]  Like someone would dive on him, but he would like angle himself and just ended up just stepping on them.
[14:00.400 --> 14:03.120]  So he was getting like higher and higher as the bundle was growing.
[14:03.440 --> 14:05.220]  But in the end he just succumbed.
[14:05.300 --> 14:08.740]  And he was like probably on top of five people, but five people were on top.
[14:09.160 --> 14:12.680]  It was, and I was just watching, like I refused to bundle on my own friend.
[14:13.400 --> 14:15.040]  But, uh, I did, I also didn't help him.
[14:15.180 --> 14:16.980]  And I, I watched it.
[14:17.040 --> 14:18.140]  It just looks so cool.
[14:18.140 --> 14:20.440]  How often did bundles occur?
[14:20.720 --> 14:22.600]  Like, was this every day someone would get bundled?
[14:22.600 --> 14:31.320]  Oh no, this was probably maybe once a month would be a significant, like, you know, approaching a hundred people bundle at my school.
[14:31.340 --> 14:32.000]  Oh Jesus.
[14:32.880 --> 14:33.220]  Yeah.
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.220]  And it was always just, it's just always all the blokes, like girls wouldn't get involved.
[14:37.420 --> 14:41.880]  So you'd end up with just a load of girls just stood on their own while everyone was bundling.
[14:42.540 --> 14:45.860]  Do you think, uh, do you think they still bundle to this day at that school?
[14:46.240 --> 14:46.860]  I hope so.
[14:46.860 --> 14:50.020]  Like it wasn't a tradition you started, you inherited it, right?
[14:50.400 --> 14:52.980]  Yeah. Yeah. I think that's how most school stuff goes.
[14:53.140 --> 14:54.320]  You can also get grundend.
[14:54.820 --> 14:55.260]  What's that?
[14:55.660 --> 14:58.100]  It's just like the, uh, it's like a dumpster on wheels.
[14:58.420 --> 14:58.780]  Okay.
[14:59.280 --> 15:00.360]  You just get lobbed in one of those.
[15:00.580 --> 15:01.700]  Oh, that's less fun.
[15:01.740 --> 15:03.280]  But yeah, another inherited tradition.
[15:03.900 --> 15:11.500]  How about you, Andrew? I, have you, I assume you've been, you've, have you been kicked by as many kids as you've kicked in your life?
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.040]  Yeah, actually. Cause it's zero. The number is zero on both fronts.
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.240]  So yeah, that's, that's a factual, factual statement, Geoff. I haven't kicked anybody.
[15:20.480 --> 15:22.000]  I don't think I've ever been kicked.
[15:22.160 --> 15:22.780]  Punched in the head?
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.460]  Yeah, not really. Like no, no great stories relating to it. Definitely haven't been bundled.
[15:27.460 --> 15:32.120]  I just don't know how you have this indestructible nose when it's just never been tested.
[15:32.740 --> 15:34.780]  It's just, you can, you can kind of sense it.
[15:34.900 --> 15:38.040]  And here's the thing, like my head is so big, it's going to get hit.
[15:38.120 --> 15:40.340]  If I was in a fight, there's just no way around it.
[15:40.340 --> 15:44.220]  It's an absolute thing, but I've avoided it for the most part.
[15:44.820 --> 15:48.360]  I don't ever want to hear about you getting hit by anyone for any reason.
[15:48.780 --> 15:51.260]  Yeah, I don't. It hasn't happened in a long time.
[15:51.320 --> 15:51.480]  Good.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.640]  I had one, I wish I had like a fun school story with Gavin or like a good school fight.
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.700]  It was like a kid punched me once and I said, why? And then they walked away and that was it.
[16:01.740 --> 16:03.460]  That was my big school brawl.
[16:04.740 --> 16:08.700]  Why did you do that? They had no response. They're just like, I'm angry. And then they left.
[16:09.500 --> 16:10.100]  Zero excitement.
[16:10.880 --> 16:14.720]  I used to get, I used to get popped from time to time just from my mouth.
[16:14.900 --> 16:17.180]  I used to have a real smart mouth when I was in high school.
[16:17.620 --> 16:19.900]  I had a real, I had a real problem with being sarcastic.
[16:20.420 --> 16:21.320]  That went away.
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.040]  Oh dude, it's so much better than it was.
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.560]  Should we talk about what we did yesterday?
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.420]  Yeah, hold on. Before we do though, can we talk about this Antonio Brown tweet that Eric sent us?
[16:32.420 --> 16:36.740]  While we're kind of on the subject of getting hit and talking about sportsy stuff.
[16:36.960 --> 16:37.000]  Of course.
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.720]  I'll just read it. Eric sent this to us right as we were starting the pleasantries, Gavin.
[16:40.820 --> 16:46.000]  Antonio Brown, if you don't know him, he's a, he's a wide receiver in NFL football.
[16:46.180 --> 16:47.960]  He was a famous one. He played for a lot of teams.
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.480]  Was considered really, really talented, but also kind of like a loose cannon.
[16:54.340 --> 16:56.760]  So here's the quote he wrote on his Twitter.
[16:56.760 --> 17:00.740]  My biggest regret in my career doesn't involve calling my GM a cracker.
[17:01.120 --> 17:04.520]  Or showing up to the Raiders camp late in a hot air balloon with frozen feet.
[17:04.860 --> 17:06.860]  Or throwing rocks at that UPS driver.
[17:07.220 --> 17:13.840]  And it definitely doesn't involve me taking my shirt off and doing a victory lap around the Jets stadium mid-game while throwing up deuces.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.480]  That's how he ended his career in the NFL, by the way. That was last year.
[17:16.940 --> 17:22.060]  My biggest regret is that I'll never get to see me, Antonio Brown, play a game live.
[17:22.060 --> 17:28.020]  Sure, I can watch the game afterwards, but I can't imagine what that was like for you all to see something like that.
[17:28.540 --> 17:31.620]  Like watching the Beatles or Jesus perform at Red Rocks.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.460]  Antonio Brown, on his biggest regret.
[17:36.960 --> 17:43.180]  He compared seeing him play football to watching Jesus perform live at Red Rocks.
[17:43.380 --> 17:45.320]  That's such a Kanye mindset.
[17:45.780 --> 17:46.960]  It is. Yeah.
[17:46.960 --> 17:52.400]  There are other scandals that he is part of that he did not decide to mention.
[17:53.340 --> 17:55.680]  He's had quite the career over the last few years.
[17:56.160 --> 17:57.380]  There's only so many characters on Twitter.
[17:57.820 --> 17:58.140]  That's true.
[17:59.600 --> 18:02.620]  So yeah, we should absolutely talk about what we did yesterday, Gavin.
[18:03.660 --> 18:11.140]  I'm actually glad to talk about it because I told you guys I would have a prototype of a fruit glove for this week, and I don't.
[18:11.420 --> 18:14.000]  And the reason I don't is because of what we did yesterday.
[18:14.000 --> 18:22.100]  Can I just say, as somebody who wasn't part of what happened, but has seen images of it, it looked like it was an incredible time.
[18:22.460 --> 18:30.140]  And I don't exactly know what was going on with Gavin, but it appeared to be like some form of torture device, is how I'd describe it.
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.500]  Like if somebody tried to make an ironing board, a torture device is sort of what I was able to see.
[18:35.800 --> 18:36.860]  But it looked like a lot of fun.
[18:37.240 --> 18:39.200]  Yeah, I definitely felt like I was on some sort of rack.
[18:40.220 --> 18:41.280]  Well, technically you were.
[18:41.280 --> 18:49.280]  I wish we could release the images that Andrew's talking about on social, but Eric says we should hold on to them because he doesn't want to give stuff away.
[18:49.660 --> 18:52.840]  Yeah, we should wait to actually release the images.
[18:53.200 --> 18:55.420]  What if we blur 90% of it?
[18:56.020 --> 19:00.700]  Okay, Gavin, if you want to blur 90% of the image...
[19:00.700 --> 19:01.340]  Well, I said we.
[19:02.180 --> 19:04.100]  Yeah, we is you, so yeah, you can go nuts.
[19:04.320 --> 19:07.220]  I just want to know what the 10% would be.
[19:07.220 --> 19:11.220]  What would you like them to see in the 90% rule? What's getting eliminated?
[19:12.420 --> 19:20.200]  There's an image that's so disturbing and so funny. I had Eric send it to me last night, and I was showing it to Emily.
[19:20.320 --> 19:24.140]  And it's so funny Gavin says that because the first thing she said, she was like, you got to show that to everybody.
[19:24.220 --> 19:26.120]  And I was like, we can't. Eric doesn't want to.
[19:27.020 --> 19:31.360]  And she goes, maybe you could blur everything and just that be the point of the image.
[19:31.740 --> 19:32.600]  Emily said that?
[19:32.920 --> 19:35.420]  Yeah, she said it last night to me, almost verbatim to what you said.
[19:35.440 --> 19:35.960]  That's amazing.
[19:35.960 --> 19:40.300]  Yeah, so you two are thinking alike. I don't know how I feel about that.
[19:40.720 --> 19:41.120]  Great.
[19:45.240 --> 19:47.140]  I am in so much pain.
[19:47.420 --> 19:52.280]  Are you really? So what? All right. So I don't want to hold the audience in suspense any longer.
[19:52.520 --> 20:01.340]  So what he's referring to is yesterday we filmed episodes one and two of the show that we've been talking about.
[20:01.360 --> 20:03.400]  Our video show that we've been talking about for a while now.
[20:03.400 --> 20:06.780]  I pitched it about a year ago internally called Does It Do?
[20:07.540 --> 20:19.420]  It's an infomercial docu-series reality show where we go in and we test the efficacy of as-seen-on-TV products to determine if they are right for you or not.
[20:20.060 --> 20:21.780]  And we've been talking about doing it for like a year.
[20:21.860 --> 20:25.820]  We've mentioned it on this show a few times, not too much, because I don't know when we were ever going to make it.
[20:25.820 --> 20:30.780]  But we made one and two yesterday, and all we're doing, might I add, is we're just testing.
[20:31.100 --> 20:33.640]  We're just doing like A-B testing for as-seen-on-TV products.
[20:33.860 --> 20:35.020]  So why would you be sore?
[20:35.300 --> 20:39.740]  I think I broke my hand and my ass in two different incidents.
[20:40.320 --> 20:43.600]  Dude, I'll be honest, man. I didn't want to turn around when I heard you hit the ground.
[20:46.440 --> 20:53.560]  We were sprinting for a thing, for a test, and Gavin immediately hit the ground.
[20:54.740 --> 21:02.720]  And it sounded like if you take a side of beef, like you go into one of those meat trucks and you get like half a cow.
[21:03.100 --> 21:08.660]  It sounded like if you held it about seven feet above the ground and just dropped it and let that meat slap against the ground.
[21:08.880 --> 21:10.420]  That's what it sounded like when you hit the ground.
[21:10.780 --> 21:13.880]  And it wasn't even like a good... it wasn't like it looked good.
[21:13.940 --> 21:16.540]  Like I went through a bunch of stuff and it looked all cinematic.
[21:16.860 --> 21:18.500]  I just slipped onto my ass.
[21:19.400 --> 21:22.600]  So it's like all the pain, but without anything that looked any good.
[21:22.600 --> 21:24.980]  And it was all because I was trying to push Geoff through the set.
[21:27.240 --> 21:31.760]  Gavin wiped out so many times while we were doing this.
[21:31.840 --> 21:34.180]  And Geoff, I don't think watched him do it.
[21:34.400 --> 21:40.880]  I watched it every time and grimaced like, oh, we're going to have to like take Gavin to the hospital.
[21:41.080 --> 21:44.720]  There was one where he fell and just laid there holding his wrist.
[21:44.820 --> 21:48.340]  And I went, there's no way his wrist is not broken.
[21:48.760 --> 21:51.280]  It was bad. It was fucking bad.
[21:51.280 --> 21:54.660]  I got out of the Uber after I got home.
[21:54.840 --> 21:57.560]  And I was just like, oh, I just feel like I've been beaten up.
[21:57.680 --> 21:59.200]  It was like a post bundle feeling.
[22:03.140 --> 22:04.560]  I'm just feeling my age.
[22:04.660 --> 22:09.720]  I think like slipping onto my ass, I've probably done maybe 50 times in my life.
[22:09.740 --> 22:15.740]  But now it's like, it's really registering to the point where I'm like getting up and sitting down with groans because it hurts.
[22:16.480 --> 22:19.720]  Yeah, your body becomes a groan tube when you hit about 35.
[22:23.870 --> 22:31.170]  And it's like, I have groan tube every time I've stood up or sat down for the first time of the day for like the last seven years of my life, probably.
[22:34.090 --> 22:38.550]  Now I'm just picturing the grape lady is like a palette of spilling groan juice.
[22:41.870 --> 22:47.410]  Oh, man. Grape lady came up the other day at home for some reason, even though everybody has seen her a million times.
[22:47.410 --> 22:51.870]  And Emily and I still sat down and rewatched the grape lady probably 20 times in a row.
[22:51.970 --> 22:53.470]  It never stops being funny.
[22:55.850 --> 22:57.930]  She's the gift that keeps on giving, man.
[22:58.090 --> 23:04.130]  There's a sound that comes from people that's it's so it's from so deep within when they're really hurt.
[23:04.210 --> 23:07.090]  Like you watch someone like fall off a roof and get winded.
[23:07.090 --> 23:12.870]  And it's not like a scream. It's just like, oh, it's just so you can't replicate it.
[23:12.870 --> 23:14.910]  I think that's what the grape lady did.
[23:15.390 --> 23:20.210]  Yeah, it's like the grape lady, the grapes pierced her to her core.
[23:20.750 --> 23:24.970]  Like that is the deepest pain that we have heard. And it was because of grapes.
[23:25.510 --> 23:27.770]  It is intense, deep, guttural pain.
[23:28.030 --> 23:29.630]  Yeah, the wine was singing.
[23:30.330 --> 23:31.330]  Like, oh my God.
[23:32.390 --> 23:36.290]  It's like if you needed a sound effect for death, that's what it's like.
[23:36.310 --> 23:39.930]  It's just the most pain and not wanting to exist.
[23:40.230 --> 23:42.210]  It's terrible. It's hilarious.
[23:43.690 --> 23:45.350]  But I think it went really well.
[23:45.750 --> 23:52.570]  I don't know how Gavin and Eric feel, but it was it was a little hard because I was telling this to some other people yesterday.
[23:52.730 --> 23:56.710]  I initially wrote down the pitch for the show and developed the one sheet for it over a year ago.
[23:56.810 --> 24:01.890]  And I haven't thought about it much since then in terms of like sitting down and actually making the show.
[24:02.050 --> 24:04.510]  Because I already came up with the idea a year ago.
[24:04.550 --> 24:05.550]  It's in my head somewhere. Right.
[24:05.570 --> 24:11.530]  And so yesterday when we sat down to finally make it, I was like, fuck, how long has it been since I looked at this information?
[24:11.530 --> 24:14.750]  I think what you said, I don't really remember what this is.
[24:14.930 --> 24:16.750]  Yeah, I had to sit down and re-familiarize myself.
[24:16.870 --> 24:18.910]  Luckily, Eric had to run a show, which helped a lot.
[24:20.230 --> 24:21.450]  He did some awesome producing.
[24:22.010 --> 24:25.690]  But yeah, I think we're going to film an eight episode season.
[24:26.450 --> 24:27.310]  And we think two.
[24:27.990 --> 24:31.430]  But we can't film any more for like a month because Gavin's got schedule problems.
[24:32.270 --> 24:34.110]  So Eric, when do you think it'll come out?
[24:34.810 --> 24:45.890]  I think that the first episode, honestly, if I can get an editor on this, which is, with our bandwidth, tough, I think we could get something out.
[24:46.370 --> 24:50.870]  Man, this episode comes out on like the 24th. I bet I could get something out next week.
[24:51.690 --> 24:52.810]  Wow, that would be insane.
[24:53.010 --> 24:56.490]  In terms of like by the end of August, I'd like to have one episode out.
[24:56.830 --> 24:59.150]  And I know that might drag because it's one episode.
[24:59.650 --> 25:01.710]  Then a second episode probably like the following week.
[25:01.870 --> 25:03.510]  And then who knows when we can do the rest.
[25:03.510 --> 25:10.210]  But I'd rather have something out and have people watch and give us some feedback to see if they enjoy it.
[25:10.390 --> 25:15.090]  And then really like let's film like ten in a day.
[25:15.610 --> 25:17.210]  I'd love to just do like ten.
[25:17.210 --> 25:20.370]  They are so fun. They were so fun to do.
[25:20.550 --> 25:21.770]  I would love to do like ten in a day.
[25:22.370 --> 25:23.250]  You're going to kill Gavin.
[25:27.090 --> 25:30.530]  I haven't tried, for the record, I didn't try to hurt Gavin at all.
[25:30.930 --> 25:31.370]  100%.
[25:31.370 --> 25:32.510]  This is not on Geoff.
[25:33.090 --> 25:34.090]  Absolutely on Gavin.
[25:34.230 --> 25:36.810]  It was all me. Every single injury I took.
[25:36.930 --> 25:40.270]  And I didn't even expect to do any sort of stunt the entire day.
[25:40.370 --> 25:41.150]  It just kept happening.
[25:41.790 --> 25:45.370]  I mean, it was every single thing that happened to me was my fault.
[25:45.570 --> 25:47.890]  Well, you said you're trying to shove Geoff through the set.
[25:48.150 --> 25:50.630]  So like it's definitely undeniably on you.
[25:50.650 --> 25:53.050]  Because I decided we should do a race at one point.
[25:56.230 --> 26:00.990]  It was Gavin saying we should do a race and then Geoff just keeps going, what?
[26:00.990 --> 26:04.210]  What do you mean? How do we race? What do you mean?
[26:04.330 --> 26:07.510]  And then Gavin just going, go! Ready, go! Go! Ready, go!
[26:07.630 --> 26:08.250]  It was great.
[26:09.090 --> 26:11.750]  Yeah, I don't want to hype it up. It wasn't like a...
[26:11.750 --> 26:13.290]  It was very goofy.
[26:14.050 --> 26:15.550]  Yeah, this isn't going to be like...
[26:15.550 --> 26:16.710]  This isn't like...
[26:16.710 --> 26:22.450]  This isn't some big Rooster Teeth first production that we spent tons of money on.
[26:22.670 --> 26:24.810]  And it's going to be like a 30 minute episode.
[26:24.990 --> 26:26.870]  I think the episodes are probably eight or nine minutes.
[26:27.330 --> 26:28.090]  Maybe ten.
[26:28.450 --> 26:29.690]  Remember, think f*** face.
[26:29.690 --> 26:31.530]  It's very dumb.
[26:31.650 --> 26:37.550]  But I will say this, the set that I had in my head, Eric captured perfectly.
[26:38.150 --> 26:42.610]  And that was... I mean, it was like a one for one perfect set.
[26:42.830 --> 26:50.450]  I was so happy with like the color palette and our design team, Michelle Sontag in design, with that Does It Do logo.
[26:50.870 --> 26:51.470]  Oh, it's perfect.
[26:52.010 --> 26:52.790]  Nailed it.
[26:52.990 --> 26:55.850]  It's a shame you messed up the costume.
[26:56.570 --> 26:58.190]  I didn't mess up the costume.
[26:59.910 --> 27:00.850]  Hey, Gavin.
[27:01.410 --> 27:01.550]  Yeah.
[27:01.690 --> 27:03.510]  I got the right size for you.
[27:03.530 --> 27:05.910]  You fit perfectly in that shirt.
[27:06.430 --> 27:07.790]  It wasn't what I asked for.
[27:08.370 --> 27:10.270]  You said extra medium, that's large.
[27:10.550 --> 27:12.890]  What you asked for doesn't exist, dickhead.
[27:13.450 --> 27:14.690]  I'm going to defend Eric here.
[27:14.910 --> 27:18.870]  If somebody tells you what their shirt size is extra medium, what are you going to buy them?
[27:19.390 --> 27:19.750]  Large.
[27:20.590 --> 27:22.770]  No, that's not how extra works.
[27:22.890 --> 27:23.510]  Yeah, even Nick.
[27:23.730 --> 27:24.490]  Even Nick.
[27:24.670 --> 27:29.050]  No, no, because with small, extra small is smaller than small.
[27:29.050 --> 27:29.630]  With large.
[27:29.730 --> 27:30.830]  What's extra large?
[27:30.910 --> 27:33.130]  Extra large is larger than large.
[27:33.250 --> 27:33.410]  Right.
[27:33.790 --> 27:34.790]  So extra medium.
[27:35.250 --> 27:36.270]  Your point is large.
[27:36.650 --> 27:36.950]  The only one.
[27:36.970 --> 27:38.320]  The only one.
[27:38.830 --> 27:42.770]  The only one that's extra being small.
[27:42.970 --> 27:43.610]  There's one.
[27:44.070 --> 27:44.830]  The rest are bigger.
[27:45.310 --> 27:47.810]  No, extra medium could not be more medium.
[27:48.050 --> 27:50.790]  It's like absolutely straight in the middle medium.
[27:51.470 --> 27:52.350]  That's medium.
[27:52.730 --> 27:54.590]  You're describing medium.
[27:55.210 --> 27:55.710]  I know.
[27:56.410 --> 27:57.710]  That's what I asked for.
[27:57.710 --> 28:06.810]  I actually, before Gavin got there, Eric had the costumes laid out and I went over to see which one was mine and they were both the exact same waist and the exact same shirt size.
[28:07.170 --> 28:11.730]  I looked at Eric and I was like, Gavin's not going to be happy if he finds out he and I are the same size now.
[28:13.170 --> 28:14.990]  I was like, man, things must be going rough.
[28:16.290 --> 28:21.170]  I wrote extra medium as a small slack joke and you took that to mean large.
[28:21.390 --> 28:23.430]  And I just don't think that's what extra medium means.
[28:24.950 --> 28:26.990]  I just, I don't know how you defend that.
[28:26.990 --> 28:27.850]  Fuck this.
[28:28.330 --> 28:29.810]  Yeah, I really don't.
[28:31.830 --> 28:33.330]  I'm with you, Eric. Fuck this.
[28:34.450 --> 28:35.330]  I'm with Eric too.
[28:37.170 --> 28:38.010]  What? What?
[28:39.130 --> 28:42.830]  I just said it to be an also. I just thought, you know, I'd still end up with a medium.
[28:43.050 --> 28:44.110]  I can see your confusion.
[28:44.450 --> 28:46.010]  Why would you end up with a medium?
[28:46.350 --> 28:48.090]  You told me a different size.
[28:48.410 --> 28:49.490]  Extra medium!
[28:52.530 --> 28:56.890]  How can you agree with me and still argue your point?
[28:59.050 --> 29:01.830]  I mean, it's not what I would have bought, but I can see why you did.
[29:02.010 --> 29:03.030]  What the fuck?
[29:08.980 --> 29:11.320]  Now a word from our sponsor, BetterHelp.

[29:20.600 --> 29:25.760]  Other things I do sometimes to help with my mental health is listen to music or have a relaxing bath.

[29:29.800 --> 29:33.820]  I've had to sort through all kinds of issues through therapy and it has been incredibly helpful to me.

[32:30.000 --> 32:33.220]  Today is... well, you know what, he's not going to guess anything useful.
[32:33.360 --> 32:34.920]  Is it the end of the redemption year?
[32:35.220 --> 32:36.360]  No, I think that happened already.
[32:36.360 --> 32:45.140]  This is the final day of my bike ride banning because of the vasectomy.
[32:45.280 --> 32:46.960]  As of tomorrow, I can ride my bike again.
[32:47.500 --> 32:48.100]  That's exciting.
[32:48.540 --> 32:49.660]  And how's your scrot rot?
[32:50.060 --> 32:51.720]  The jock itch is under control.
[32:52.280 --> 32:58.280]  Yeah, I mean, it's still there, it's still discolored, but they say that that's normal and it'll still be there for up to eight weeks.
[32:58.280 --> 33:03.680]  But I'm taking the pills. I'm like a week into like two weeks of antibiotics or whatever.
[33:03.860 --> 33:06.220]  And they gave me a much bigger tube of cream.
[33:06.740 --> 33:14.220]  And I'm in no pain, but I'm still daily applying jock itch cream and taking a jock itch pill every day.
[33:14.260 --> 33:22.860]  So I'm still just focused on dick health, dick area health every day of my life, as I have been for what seems like six weeks straight.
[33:23.240 --> 33:26.480]  Yeah, this will be more than six weeks straight now.
[33:26.980 --> 33:30.780]  I can't. And you've never had this issue before, and now it's just part of your life.
[33:31.000 --> 33:35.480]  And it's like it just it perfectly framed my vasectomy.
[33:35.640 --> 33:38.620]  I got it two weeks before it went away for the vasectomy.
[33:38.780 --> 33:42.360]  As soon as the vasectomy started to wean off the vasectomy, it came back.
[33:42.900 --> 33:43.060]  Yeah.
[33:43.720 --> 33:47.400]  Is it one of those things where once you get it, you're more prone to getting it again later?
[33:48.000 --> 33:48.620]  I don't think so.
[33:48.800 --> 33:50.360]  I think it just had a terrible run.
[33:50.720 --> 33:53.000]  I think I just had a bad run. I think it didn't totally go away.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.860]  And I remember the dude, the pharmacist, I think I said this last time.
[33:57.120 --> 34:00.220]  The pharmacist did tell me when I got my pills and stuff, he was like, you might need more than this.
[34:00.280 --> 34:00.940]  These things are persistent.
[34:01.060 --> 34:01.960]  I was like, shut up, dude.
[34:03.600 --> 34:05.700]  So I'll be apologizing to him if I see him again.
[34:06.200 --> 34:07.920]  So is it just mainly around the front?
[34:08.100 --> 34:09.740]  Like it didn't work its way behind?
[34:10.080 --> 34:12.780]  Like in the athlete's anus?
[34:14.060 --> 34:14.740]  No, no.
[34:14.820 --> 34:18.520]  It's just like on my thigh, my right thigh.
[34:19.380 --> 34:26.280]  And then up a little bit, kind of like where the waistband is, would go around your pants.
[34:26.540 --> 34:28.260]  Kind of like in two spots.
[34:30.700 --> 34:33.000]  So just in like sweat-locked areas.
[34:33.520 --> 34:34.340]  I guess so, yeah.
[34:34.640 --> 34:42.340]  I was actually wondering, because I had been not wearing my bog-standard swim trunks this year, you know?
[34:42.420 --> 34:44.380]  The ones that I had like eight pairs of that I was just only wearing.
[34:44.620 --> 34:47.300]  I decided to mix it up a little bit this year, so I've been wearing a bunch of different shorts.
[34:47.300 --> 34:50.020]  And I'm wondering if maybe I just am disagreeing with the fabric.
[34:50.460 --> 34:53.800]  But clearly it's the jock itch, so it's probably not it.
[34:54.240 --> 34:56.280]  Yeah, well at least it's not spreading.
[34:56.820 --> 34:58.000]  It sounds like there's a cut off.
[34:58.480 --> 35:00.280]  Yeah, you've hit a cap of it.
[35:00.400 --> 35:01.380]  I think I'm on the back nine.
[35:02.000 --> 35:02.920]  We'll see, we'll see.
[35:03.860 --> 35:04.940]  I did some homework.
[35:05.480 --> 35:06.020]  Oh shit!
[35:06.680 --> 35:07.020]  What'd you do?
[35:07.580 --> 35:09.840]  I watched Hands on a Hardbody.
[35:10.360 --> 35:10.800]  Oh!
[35:11.260 --> 35:11.700]  Oh!
[35:11.980 --> 35:12.660]  That's great!
[35:12.660 --> 35:17.220]  And when I got to the credits, I noticed a very special name in there.
[35:17.740 --> 35:18.340]  Arnold Vosloo?
[35:18.520 --> 35:19.260]  Oh, Matthew McConaughey?
[35:20.780 --> 35:22.360]  Arnold frickin' Vosloo!
[35:22.760 --> 35:23.460]  I told you.
[35:23.780 --> 35:25.000]  What does he have to do with that?
[35:25.180 --> 35:26.360]  I have no idea.
[35:26.700 --> 35:28.960]  My brain still rejects that that's not Billy Zane.
[35:29.100 --> 35:30.820]  I really have an issue with that every time.
[35:30.880 --> 35:33.500]  Every time I see him as the mummy, my brain just goes Billy Zane.
[35:33.900 --> 35:34.800]  Why do you think that's Billy Zane?
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.100]  I didn't- hey, hey Andrew, until right now I thought that was Billy Zane.
[35:39.380 --> 35:39.580]  Yeah.
[35:39.720 --> 35:41.380]  You thought Billy Zane was Imhotep?
[35:41.680 --> 35:42.080]  Absolutely.
[35:42.080 --> 35:42.680]  No!
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.760]  We've talked about this on the show.
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.940]  I had that discovery like a year ago.
[35:46.260 --> 35:48.860]  I've spent most of my life thinking that Imhotep is Billy Zane.
[35:49.160 --> 35:49.820]  I didn't know that.
[35:50.140 --> 35:52.580]  I mean, I guess they got the same face and head.
[35:52.580 --> 35:54.160]  They both have like dark eyes.
[35:55.440 --> 35:56.700]  Same face and head.
[35:58.080 --> 36:01.060]  I think Arnold Vosloo's from South Africa or something.
[36:01.380 --> 36:02.860]  I didn't even know his name.
[36:03.100 --> 36:05.340]  That will always just be Billy Zane to me.
[36:06.340 --> 36:07.120]  That's crazy.
[36:07.320 --> 36:09.280]  I wonder what he would-
[36:09.280 --> 36:11.520]  It could be a different Arnold Vosloo.
[36:11.520 --> 36:13.560]  But that's a hell of a name.
[36:13.760 --> 36:15.300]  That is. That'd be quite the coincidence.
[36:16.580 --> 36:19.520]  How many- yeah, how many Donald Vosloos in film are there?
[36:20.380 --> 36:21.080]  Arnold Vosloo.
[36:23.120 --> 36:23.880]  I don't know.
[36:24.120 --> 36:24.400]  Goddammit.
[36:25.080 --> 36:31.760]  Yeah, I'm looking at IMDB and he's- that's Arnold Vosloo that's listed there as a special thanks.
[36:31.840 --> 36:32.180]  Okay.
[36:33.340 --> 36:35.480]  You're saying that those two dudes look alike.
[36:35.920 --> 36:36.240]  Yes.
[36:36.240 --> 36:43.980]  You're telling me that those two paternal twins look alike.
[36:47.600 --> 36:50.400]  Yeah, I don't know how you can't- I don't know what you don't see.
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.860]  They look the exact same.
[36:52.260 --> 36:54.240]  No, I get it. They definitely look alike.
[36:54.380 --> 36:56.520]  I never made the connection until this moment, but you're right.
[36:57.100 --> 36:59.720]  I always think of Billy Zane with hair. I think that's the thing.
[37:00.120 --> 37:01.940]  I always think of Billy Zane like in Twin Peaks.
[37:03.020 --> 37:05.500]  See, I think I've just missed hair Billy Zane.
[37:05.500 --> 37:08.140]  I don't think I've seen a lot of Zane movies. I haven't seen Titanic.
[37:08.460 --> 37:09.740]  I didn't see Twin Peaks.
[37:10.580 --> 37:13.520]  My only point of reference for Billy Zane is not a Billy Zane movie.
[37:13.700 --> 37:15.400]  Yeah, me too. Geoff, you know what it is?
[37:15.560 --> 37:21.180]  It's a Billy Corgan, like, hair, no hair, smashing pumpkins thing.
[37:22.760 --> 37:26.500]  Billy Corgan, I don't think a lot of people have seen Billy Corgan with hair.
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.580]  And I think that's what we're dealing with here.
[37:28.860 --> 37:29.920]  I think you're right. I think you're right.
[37:29.920 --> 37:32.380]  So you thought Imhotep was running around the Titanic?
[37:32.880 --> 37:34.820]  Well, I didn't know. Yeah, I guess.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.860]  Yeah, when I heard Billy Zane was in the Titanic, my brain went, oh, wow, he's in that too.
[37:39.600 --> 37:41.720]  Yeah, because I've never seen the Titanic.
[37:41.880 --> 37:44.780]  So it's not like I watch it was like Imhotep is doing shit.
[37:45.080 --> 37:47.400]  But just the knowledge.
[37:47.960 --> 37:50.080]  I always thought Billy Zane was a bit Elvis-y.
[37:50.200 --> 37:52.440]  Like, I always thought like he could have done like Elvis in a biopic.
[37:52.820 --> 37:54.440]  I could see that in the photo.
[37:54.740 --> 37:57.420]  I'm assuming that's Titanic. Or is that what is that?
[37:57.540 --> 37:58.660]  That's Twin Peaks. Twin Peaks.
[37:58.780 --> 38:01.380]  Okay. Yeah, I could see it. I could see some Elvis there.
[38:01.380 --> 38:03.340]  What did you think of Hanes on a hard body gap?
[38:03.640 --> 38:06.280]  Oh, I thought it was great. And that guy you were describing was phenomenal.
[38:06.560 --> 38:10.780]  Oh, the air conditioner guy? Oh, it's one of my favorite scenes from any movie ever.
[38:11.040 --> 38:11.980]  It's a great monologue.
[38:12.660 --> 38:14.580]  The genuine, it's like an office moment.
[38:14.660 --> 38:18.880]  The way he pivots to genuine fear about talking about his house going 15 below zero.
[38:19.940 --> 38:20.840]  It's great.
[38:21.460 --> 38:23.080]  It just builds so nicely.
[38:23.400 --> 38:29.620]  I mean, not to spoil anything, but like the reasons why certain people get eliminated is so perfect for their character
[38:29.620 --> 38:31.520]  that like you couldn't script it better.
[38:32.040 --> 38:36.940]  I'll be honest though, for a documentary about a subject, they sure as shit didn't film a lot of stuff that happened.
[38:37.240 --> 38:39.860]  No, it's mainly character interviews, I want to say, right?
[38:40.120 --> 38:43.580]  I haven't seen it in a long time, but it's a lot of like them away from the truck talking.
[38:43.900 --> 38:47.300]  I wonder how they even would have shot that because they didn't have much time beyond the truck.
[38:47.400 --> 38:49.740]  I wonder if all those interviews are post-competition.
[38:50.760 --> 38:51.580]  Oh, that's a good question.
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.020]  I never really thought about like logistically how they would have captured those moments.
[38:56.360 --> 38:57.920]  I think they were grabbing stuff as it went on.
[38:57.920 --> 38:59.360]  Like in the breaks a lot.
[39:00.020 --> 39:05.540]  That'd be wild, the like 10 of your 15 minutes spent talking about the things that are currently happening.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.220]  It's such a weird...
[39:07.220 --> 39:09.900]  Did you also watch American Movie or just Hands on a Hardbody?
[39:10.140 --> 39:11.680]  I've still got to watch American Movie.
[39:11.920 --> 39:14.640]  I think you'll like American Movie even better.
[39:15.120 --> 39:17.400]  Hands on a Hardbody is a pretty fucking great movie. They're both great.
[39:18.140 --> 39:23.900]  You get more of a deep dive into the characters in American Movie.
[39:23.900 --> 39:30.220]  You get more time with them, I'll say, and you get more invested in their lives, which I think helps.
[39:30.960 --> 39:31.900]  Who's in the credits though?
[39:32.840 --> 39:38.600]  That's a great... who's in the credits for an American movie?
[39:39.400 --> 39:40.440]  Hopefully Arnold Vosloo.
[39:40.760 --> 39:41.700]  Or at least Billy Zane.
[39:42.400 --> 39:42.680]  Yeah.
[39:43.500 --> 39:45.560]  Oh, that didn't help at all.
[39:46.380 --> 39:47.020]  What did you look up?
[39:50.080 --> 39:51.580]  Credits for an American movie?
[39:52.080 --> 39:52.840]  That didn't work.
[39:54.980 --> 39:57.700]  Google. Google didn't think that was specific enough.
[39:58.740 --> 39:59.200]  Nevermind.
[39:59.740 --> 40:04.060]  Lots of feedback about our cereal discussion from the comment leavers.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.320]  Lots of...
[40:06.320 --> 40:08.240]  We really opened up some cultural doors there.
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.980]  And apparently ricicles are just like what a frosted flake is to a cornflake.
[40:14.000 --> 40:14.360]  Oh, really?
[40:14.520 --> 40:17.060]  It's like a sugared, frosted Rice Krispie.
[40:17.680 --> 40:19.940]  But a lot of people are saying they've never seen them, so I think maybe they're done.
[40:20.840 --> 40:22.120]  That sounds good though.
[40:22.920 --> 40:27.040]  Like adding more sugar to Rice Krispies, I don't see why that would be a bad thing.
[40:27.380 --> 40:28.740]  No. That would be great.
[40:29.420 --> 40:31.180]  Maybe they sell some on eBay or something.
[40:31.900 --> 40:33.300]  Get an old box.
[40:34.580 --> 40:36.420]  Like how expired would you eat cereal?
[40:36.880 --> 40:37.660]  Oh, pretty expired.
[40:38.020 --> 40:40.620]  Yeah, pretty expired. It also depends on the cereal.
[40:41.480 --> 40:44.040]  Like what ingredients are in it or on it.
[40:44.560 --> 40:45.300]  Largely on it.
[40:46.040 --> 40:50.800]  I wouldn't want to do something that was like marshmallow-centric, like Lucky Charms. That'd be tough.
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.620]  Amazon does not have Ricicles cereal.
[40:55.260 --> 41:01.080]  I tried Cinnamon Toast Crunch for the first time in my life like five days ago, four days ago.
[41:01.280 --> 41:03.080]  I cannot believe that that's a cereal.
[41:03.340 --> 41:07.580]  It is great. It's delicious, but it's just sugar.
[41:07.980 --> 41:10.760]  It's just cinnamon sugar in a bag with texture.
[41:10.760 --> 41:12.720]  I couldn't believe how sugary it was.
[41:13.160 --> 41:19.300]  You know what's weird? I fucking love cinnamon, and I love sugar, and I love cereal, but I don't like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[41:19.300 --> 41:25.420]  I know I'm an extreme minority, but something about it doesn't go together for me.
[41:25.700 --> 41:30.620]  That's so interesting, because to me it just tastes like a cinnamon treat you would get.
[41:31.020 --> 41:31.520]  I know.
[41:32.100 --> 41:35.180]  There's no difference to me, so that's fascinating. I wonder what it is.
[41:35.180 --> 41:38.620]  I think I just don't associate cinnamon with breakfast, maybe. I don't know what it is.
[41:38.620 --> 41:44.300]  That's totally fair, because it was jarring to eat it. I could not imagine having this as a breakfast start to my day.
[41:44.640 --> 41:46.560]  It's a dessert. It's a great dessert.
[41:46.560 --> 41:56.500]  The audience also seems very keen on the idea of us doing some sort of supplemental cereal tasting thing.
[41:56.920 --> 41:58.780]  So I guess we should probably do that at some point.
[41:59.040 --> 42:02.940]  Maybe we could do that during the... Maybe we could all have cereal to kick off our office day.
[42:04.180 --> 42:05.600]  Yeah, but Andrew can't get involved.
[42:06.620 --> 42:08.760]  He can eat cereal from fucking Canada.
[42:09.140 --> 42:14.100]  But that's what? I'm just going to eat my own cereal? Isn't the whole point that you're going to have cereals that you haven't had before?
[42:14.620 --> 42:16.940]  Well, yeah, we'll just mail them to each other and stuff.
[42:17.200 --> 42:20.440]  Okay, well that's a different conversation. I'm on board with that.
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.340]  I'm just saying, I think we need to follow through. I think this is one of those things we shouldn't let dangle.
[42:24.460 --> 42:30.360]  No, I agree. But we also have the chips. I'm excited about the chip-off. Let's get the chip-off going. Then we can do the cereal.
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.840]  Yeah, stuff's really backing up.
[42:33.140 --> 42:33.740]  That's good, though.
[42:34.140 --> 42:36.660]  Well, it's because he wouldn't leave Canada, for Christ's sake.
[42:37.680 --> 42:40.060]  I said I wouldn't leave. It's very clear.
[42:41.180 --> 42:41.540]  Wait, when?
[42:41.540 --> 42:42.060]  That's also true.
[42:42.320 --> 42:43.060]  Vegas, November.
[42:45.080 --> 42:47.260]  We're not going to Vegas in November.
[42:47.580 --> 42:48.960]  Oh, but I said that's when I'd go.
[42:49.760 --> 42:55.760]  Have you ever said that publicly, Eric? Do we announce that for some reason we're not doing that now?
[42:56.220 --> 43:01.160]  Yeah, I think we talked about it. Didn't we? I think so. Well, either way, we're not going to Vegas in November.
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.120]  I'm pretty sure we did. Nick's right. We did.
[43:04.440 --> 43:05.640]  Did we? No, I don't think we did.
[43:06.460 --> 43:09.740]  Okay, then we're announcing it here. We're not going to Vegas in November.
[43:10.180 --> 43:11.720]  Well, it doesn't look like it.
[43:11.720 --> 43:11.960]  Yeah.
[43:12.660 --> 43:13.820]  What does that mean?
[43:14.020 --> 43:16.320]  What does that mean?
[43:16.520 --> 43:19.840]  I mean, we might just go to Vegas in November and just fucking go.
[43:20.040 --> 43:22.160]  That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the show.
[43:22.580 --> 43:24.600]  Yeah, well, it's probably not going to go.
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.660]  Why do you keep saying publicly? Why do you keep putting things on it? Qualifiers or whatever?
[43:31.140 --> 43:34.260]  I mean, who can say anything definitively anymore in 2022?
[43:35.100 --> 43:38.400]  Everyone else got to do their live show and we don't do ours.
[43:38.400 --> 43:41.840]  Well, yeah, it's because we were going to do ours in June.
[43:42.140 --> 43:45.320]  And you guys went, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that in June.
[43:45.480 --> 43:48.380]  So we pushed it back and now we're not doing it.
[43:50.120 --> 43:54.080]  I will take ownership of the fact that I won in November, that I pushed for November.
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.580]  This is not my fault. This is insane to imply that this is in any way my fault.
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.420]  If we had done June, we would have done it.
[44:02.740 --> 44:05.420]  I will say this, it would have happened in June.
[44:07.260 --> 44:08.480]  You son of a bitch.
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.380]  I don't really know how you're absolved. Like you changed the date.
[44:12.600 --> 44:15.620]  Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? You're going to blame me for this?
[44:16.260 --> 44:17.140]  That's outrageous.
[44:18.240 --> 44:19.260]  I thought we were pretty clear.
[44:19.660 --> 44:23.240]  That's outrageous. I'm not going to get into why that's an outrageous statement.
[44:23.420 --> 44:26.620]  That'd be unfair to me, but I don't think I'm the one that dropped the ball.
[44:26.820 --> 44:27.660]  I'll just say that.
[44:30.180 --> 44:34.780]  I'm not the one. I'm not getting into what's happening, but you can't blame me.
[44:34.780 --> 44:36.300]  You said Eric dropped the ball?
[44:36.540 --> 44:40.660]  I'm not saying Eric dropped the ball at all. I'm just saying the ball may have been dropped and it wasn't me.
[44:40.680 --> 44:43.760]  Somewhere a ball is on the floor, I just don't know whose legs it's in front of.
[44:43.760 --> 44:45.540]  You know who wouldn't have dropped that ball? Antonio Brown.
[44:45.900 --> 44:48.080]  If we would have had Antonio Brown, there would be no worries.
[44:48.400 --> 44:50.740]  That ball, we would be in Vegas in November.
[44:51.060 --> 44:55.760]  Hey, maybe we should, instead of whining about all the stuff we're not doing, let's focus on what we are doing.
[44:56.020 --> 44:59.440]  We're going to watch MVP 2 tomorrow morning.
[45:00.300 --> 45:01.100]  That's happening.
[45:01.100 --> 45:07.280]  That's really, it's a monkey movie morning on Friday. That is really happening.
[45:07.440 --> 45:09.340]  Andrew, have you been working on your previously on?
[45:09.700 --> 45:15.000]  Uh, I wrote, so the problem is we were going to do this like 5 months ago, so I re-watched MVP.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.400]  Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, the date changed. You can't really blame me for that one.
[45:18.840 --> 45:23.140]  So, I really got to think on what that is. You know, I guess I don't want to talk about who dropped the ball.
[45:24.160 --> 45:29.640]  Okay. I don't know what that was about. I'm just saying that people were busy.
[45:29.640 --> 45:37.080]  We had to move it, so I took all these notes, and so I have to go back and find my notes by points on the movie.
[45:37.820 --> 45:37.840]  Okay.
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.300]  Do you think it makes sense for me to record it independently? Or I feel like it would make more sense to just open with that.
[45:43.600 --> 45:45.500]  So people don't have to look for a secondary...
[45:45.500 --> 45:50.400]  What's the format? Are you explaining it? Do we get a nice slideshow? Like what happens if we get any pictures?
[45:50.400 --> 45:54.260]  Oh, I didn't even consider slideshow. No, I was just going to explain it.
[45:54.620 --> 45:55.900]  Ideally, it should be a PowerPoint.
[45:59.800 --> 46:03.520]  Or Google Sheets, if you don't have MS Office. Google Sheets is fine.
[46:03.720 --> 46:05.640]  That's true. I'll take a sheet.
[46:05.980 --> 46:07.120]  You want a PowerPoint? Okay.
[46:07.680 --> 46:07.900]  Yeah.
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.180]  And by that I mean I will post photos into the Discord while I talk about it. I'm willing to do that.
[46:13.520 --> 46:13.940]  That's great.
[46:14.600 --> 46:16.440]  But then we miss out on the transitions and stuff.
[46:17.320 --> 46:22.100]  Fuck, okay. I guess I'll be screen grabbing tonight from fucking MVP.
[46:22.580 --> 46:25.880]  If you're going to do transitions, can you do star wipes? I like those.
[46:26.720 --> 46:28.960]  Well, I'm not going to be doing transitions, but I will.
[46:29.840 --> 46:30.280]  Banana wipes?
[46:30.340 --> 46:32.800]  Banana wipes? What would a banana wipe look like?
[46:33.300 --> 46:34.700]  Banana, probably. The shape of a banana.
[46:37.560 --> 46:46.600]  First of all, I realized that I dropped the gun on this. What are the wipes? Is that like a transitional effect? What are we discussing?
[46:47.260 --> 46:53.180]  I like how much of a yes man you are. You're like, absolutely, we'll get the star wipes in there. What's a star wipe?
[46:54.400 --> 46:59.100]  He's like making notes to himself. Reminder, Google star wipe tonight.
[46:59.700 --> 47:08.160]  Can I tell you what I think a star wipe is? Where my brain immediately went? Like a scene transition with stars going from left to right into the next thing.
[47:08.580 --> 47:09.600]  That is what I imagined.
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.240]  Yeah, mostly. Or like, I mean, there's, there's, yeah, yeah. That works.
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.120]  Okay. Oh, I think, I think Gavin may have submitted a gif of one.
[47:19.120 --> 47:20.760]  Yeah, there you go. There's a gif of a star wipe.
[47:20.880 --> 47:22.220]  That's a bit of a fancy one.
[47:22.220 --> 47:24.580]  I wouldn't be asking for that level, but yeah, usually.
[47:24.880 --> 47:31.880]  Oh, those. Okay. Yeah. I know what a star wipe is then. Yeah. So what I think a banana would be like a shit. Yeah. It would be like a banana.
[47:32.040 --> 47:34.180]  It would just peel into the next scene.
[47:34.340 --> 47:35.180]  Peel into the next scene. Yeah.
[47:35.440 --> 47:40.140]  Yeah. Okay. Well, none of that's happening, but I'll do my best to try to get photos.
[47:41.860 --> 47:46.300]  You've got a whole 24 hours. Well, you got a whole at least 18 hours to work on this.
[47:47.520 --> 47:54.300]  It would be shocking. Gavin, I just learned that what F5 does. You think I'm going to fucking do banana wipes?
[47:55.220 --> 47:57.020]  I don't even know what's on my keyboard.
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.920]  I'm going to Google banana wipe and see what comes up. Banana wipe.
[48:01.380 --> 48:08.000]  I'm so excited. I got Eric asked a question about MVP2 and I didn't realize it was in our face slack.
[48:08.140 --> 48:13.820]  I thought Eric just messaged me that. And so I gave it a description and then I regretted it because like, oh, these are spoilers.
[48:13.820 --> 48:16.420]  These are key spoilers for the movie that we're going to see tomorrow.
[48:16.720 --> 48:19.900]  So all that shit was a... I found this.
[48:21.820 --> 48:27.680]  That is a banana wipe. It's a doormat. It's a doormat with a banana peel that says don't tread on me.
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.120]  That's pretty funny. Andrew, have you started shopping from the end caps?
[48:32.500 --> 48:35.120]  You want to talk about that? Oh, maybe that could be next episode.
[48:35.800 --> 48:39.300]  Yeah, it's a little bit to go into. Maybe next episode we'll go into that.
[48:39.820 --> 48:41.820]  Yeah, I can't wait to see how you didn't do it.
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.320]  Well, it's a little bit to get into. Don't get ahead of yourself. It's a little bit to get into.
[48:46.780 --> 48:49.740]  You got 18 hours before tomorrow morning to go shopping at end caps.
[48:49.820 --> 48:54.020]  No, it's it's a whole thing. I will say I had a great disappointment last night.
[48:54.120 --> 48:58.420]  I'm sitting on a broken chair. I broke my... it finally happened. Did not happen during a recording.
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.880]  That's very sad. My chair has been on the verge of breaking for like four months.
[49:03.880 --> 49:06.240]  I fell over in it.
[49:09.960 --> 49:13.580]  Back in like February when I was having like the really bad foot issues.
[49:14.080 --> 49:20.000]  I was rolling out of my chair onto my bed so I could just avoid having to put any pressure on my foot.
[49:20.340 --> 49:23.220]  And I did it one time, but I forgot to raise the armrest.
[49:23.320 --> 49:28.700]  So I just took the whole chair down with me. And it has been in a bad spot since that point.
[49:29.180 --> 49:30.320]  Did you pump a wheel off or something?
[49:30.320 --> 49:37.420]  No, it's like the my my seat part has turned into an analog stick for the range of movement it allowed.
[49:37.660 --> 49:42.240]  So I was like, this is definitely going to break. And I hope it's during the show.
[49:42.320 --> 49:48.440]  It was not. I dropped my phone. I went to pick it up while staying on the chair and it just cracked forward.
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.740]  So now my chair is constantly at a forward tilt unless I push back on it.
[49:53.980 --> 49:58.440]  And whenever I get out of my chair, it goes to the highest height setting it can go.
[49:58.440 --> 49:59.820]  It's a great issue.
[50:00.040 --> 50:07.480]  I would like to walk your room with a clipboard like a house inspector to see everything that needs to be replaced.
[50:08.260 --> 50:12.620]  There's been there been some things there have been some issues for sure.
[50:13.440 --> 50:19.060]  I had to clean. Somebody came through recently to check all the smoke alarms.
[50:19.620 --> 50:25.900]  And while I was cleaning things, I noticed in the corner of the ceiling was still partially blue from a time.
[50:25.900 --> 50:30.940]  I dropped the slurpee and just flung it everywhere in my room from like five months ago.
[50:31.040 --> 50:33.320]  So I had to get rid of that. I remember that.
[50:33.800 --> 50:37.760]  Yeah, I went on a real run of dropping drinks to the point now where it is.
[50:37.840 --> 50:41.060]  I've never been more scared than when I have to hold two drinks in my hands.
[50:41.140 --> 50:46.980]  If I've won in each hand, there is a genuine deep fear rooted in past trauma.
[50:47.380 --> 50:50.100]  I throw them. They just launch out of my hand.
[50:50.100 --> 50:55.680]  I need one hand to brace for impact because I'm almost certainly going to fall or drop or trip or do something.
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.560]  If I have the largest size drinks I could possibly have in my hands.
[51:01.040 --> 51:06.240]  I'm going to be. I feel like all the times we've hung out in real life in the past, I've never been worried for your safety.
[51:06.680 --> 51:10.460]  But now I'm just going to. I can't believe you never fell in front of us.
[51:11.460 --> 51:14.220]  Well, I guess you felt. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:15.800 --> 51:19.000]  I can't believe I never saw you roll an ankle on a curb or anything.
[51:19.700 --> 51:23.460]  Technically, Geoff has seen that, too, but it was in the dark and I don't think he noticed.
[51:25.020 --> 51:27.700]  I'm trying to think if I ever just straight up.
[51:28.140 --> 51:30.500]  But now there's a time where I was in a room.
[51:31.160 --> 51:37.080]  See, I don't you're not very observant necessarily, Gavin, where I was visiting the office and I was in a room.
[51:37.080 --> 51:38.940]  I didn't know what I was looking out for.
[51:39.740 --> 51:48.760]  You walked in like, hey, like said to the people in the room, walk through, went to a different room, was there for a little bit, walk back out.
[51:48.880 --> 51:52.900]  I was just looking at you the entire time waiting for you to like see me.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.080]  And then I was going to be like, hey, and you just didn't. You just left.
[51:56.180 --> 51:59.000]  You had no idea that I was in that room. Oh, you know what it feels like.
[51:59.140 --> 52:01.140]  Yeah, I do. Yeah, I can relate to that, Geoff.
[52:02.140 --> 52:04.160]  I'm probably just like, oh, I wonder who that is.
[52:06.660 --> 52:12.100]  Zero. What are you going to do about this new double drink carrying phobia that you have?
[52:12.240 --> 52:23.120]  Because it sounds to me like we need to do some sort of a drink carrying immersion obstacle course therapy where we can like recreate your room outside and then run you through drills.
[52:23.460 --> 52:25.840]  Oh, holding two drinks. Yeah, I don't.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.300]  Strengthen your ability and your confidence so that you don't have to worry about this.
[52:30.360 --> 52:33.680]  That's what I do need. You're right. I need to gain my drink confidence back.
[52:33.680 --> 52:37.200]  It is at an all time low. You need carry confidence.
[52:38.100 --> 52:41.300]  What's your ankle integrity at right now, like percentage wise?
[52:42.020 --> 52:44.020]  That's good. I'd say my ankles are 100 percent.
[52:45.160 --> 52:49.920]  That sounds like marathon talk. Yeah, you know, for sure.
[52:50.620 --> 52:53.440]  Yeah, you know, those exist. We'll do this. We'll get around to it.
[52:53.760 --> 52:55.600]  When else are you going to be 100 percent?
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.080]  That's the thing. I don't want to immediately go back to 0.5 on both.
[53:00.080 --> 53:06.180]  I'm kind of enjoying this stretch of 100 before I put myself back through the ringer.
[53:08.020 --> 53:10.400]  Huh. I think that's no way to live life.
[53:12.120 --> 53:13.500]  Yeah? In what way?
[53:14.660 --> 53:19.740]  Well, you're potentially going to miss out on experiencing a marathon because of fear.
[53:20.180 --> 53:24.360]  Kevin, you like to live your life 0.5 ankles at a time. What are you saying?
[53:24.360 --> 53:31.980]  If anything, I'm arguing I want to be able to enjoy things by having functioning ankles.
[53:32.320 --> 53:36.420]  You clearly want to do a marathon. You're never going to be able to do it at less than 100 percent.
[53:37.760 --> 53:40.000]  So what do you need to start the marathon?
[53:40.480 --> 53:42.960]  I need some more time at 100 percent is what I need.
[53:43.260 --> 53:44.880]  That's fair. You just need to drink it in.
[53:45.060 --> 53:49.280]  Yeah, I just need to enjoy it a little bit before I crash the plane again.
[53:50.140 --> 53:55.020]  There needs to be time. There's reasons why I didn't do the burger challenge back to back to back.
[53:55.160 --> 53:58.440]  I need time. These things take a toll.
[54:00.100 --> 54:05.160]  They're tough, but I'm excited. One day it will happen. Hopefully soon. Hopefully like in a month.
[54:05.640 --> 54:08.740]  If I get a month of good ankle time, no issues, I'm in.
[54:09.300 --> 54:10.500]  A month is enough.
[54:12.080 --> 54:13.980]  Do you guys ever watch that show Hard Knocks?
[54:14.440 --> 54:14.860]  Absolutely.
[54:14.860 --> 54:18.280]  Gavin, you've probably not seen it. It's an HBO show.
[54:18.560 --> 54:25.860]  Each season, they follow one of the worst performing NFL teams from the previous seasons.
[54:26.060 --> 54:30.120]  Spring training. Players trying to make the team, getting cut.
[54:30.620 --> 54:32.380]  Rookies coming in, trying to make a name for themselves.
[54:32.820 --> 54:35.380]  It's just like a docuseries. It's six episodes.
[54:37.060 --> 54:40.800]  It's literally just the team trying to build themselves up and get ready for the season.
[54:40.800 --> 54:44.660]  This year, it's the Detroit Lions because they only won three games last year.
[54:46.460 --> 54:54.900]  The first episode has the coach sitting in front of all the guys in an air-conditioned theater.
[54:55.520 --> 54:56.620]  He's giving them a pep talk.
[54:56.940 --> 55:00.000]  He goes, pay attention to how you feel right now.
[55:00.160 --> 55:03.040]  How you feel right now? Soak it up and enjoy it.
[55:03.240 --> 55:06.880]  This is the best you're going to feel until next March.
[55:06.880 --> 55:16.580]  You're going to get progressively sore and more injured and shittier every day from today for the next 10 months.
[55:16.920 --> 55:19.660]  So just accept it and acknowledge it and move on.
[55:20.040 --> 55:24.480]  But soak up today and enjoy today because today is the last day you're going to feel like this.
[55:24.940 --> 55:28.440]  That's all that was running through my head the whole time Andrew was talking about being at 100%.
[55:28.440 --> 55:32.460]  It's funny because he just needs more time to soak it in.
[55:32.660 --> 55:34.620]  I do. I need to soak it in a little bit more.
[55:34.620 --> 55:38.660]  I like that a month was the amount though. That's not very long.
[55:39.040 --> 55:40.140]  How long would you give?
[55:41.580 --> 55:49.700]  If I was someone with the ankle problems that you had and you wanted to really enjoy the 100% ankles, I'd probably want a year.
[55:50.460 --> 55:54.900]  A year? Okay, but here's the thing. If I say a year, I'm going to get killed for that, I feel like.
[55:55.440 --> 55:56.660]  There's no way we're letting him go a year.
[55:56.800 --> 55:58.540]  There's no way that that's going to fly.
[55:58.840 --> 56:01.860]  You are setting him up for failure.
[56:02.360 --> 56:09.000]  Feels like they did it after a month. Just a month. He's like, alright, time to get out there and risk both ankles again.
[56:09.280 --> 56:10.320]  Yeah, I think a month is fair.
[56:10.440 --> 56:20.140]  I will say a month can be a long time. I haven't talked about this, but Emily went out of town to go visit her family and Millie went to go stay with her mom.
[56:20.140 --> 56:25.580]  And I had eight days, just recently, completely and totally alone.
[56:26.260 --> 56:32.000]  It was just me and the dog. I didn't see anybody. I didn't talk. I did go to the movies with Jack on a Saturday.
[56:32.480 --> 56:38.940]  But for like eight days, pretty much straight, I didn't see or talk to anybody or interact with human beings at all.
[56:39.300 --> 56:43.980]  And that was only a week, and it was at least a month of my life that it took.
[56:44.460 --> 56:51.160]  So a month can feel like a year if you're alone in my house with just a bulldog and no friends or family.
[56:51.160 --> 56:53.680]  You easily could have reached out for a lovely bike ride.
[56:56.080 --> 56:57.560]  He's on break.
[56:57.620 --> 56:58.940]  That's a great point.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.760]  I'm not complaining. I'm not complaining about it. I needed the time to decompress.
[57:04.360 --> 57:09.840]  I had just spent a pretty hellacious couple weeks dealing with Millie. Millie had her big jaw surgery.
[57:10.460 --> 57:14.920]  That was the culmination of years and years of preparation and stuff.
[57:15.480 --> 57:18.400]  So I needed a week to come down.
[57:19.100 --> 57:21.480]  But yeah, I guess I could have reached out.
[57:23.380 --> 57:24.080]  I was here.
[57:25.980 --> 57:28.200]  I'll be honest with you. For some reason, I thought you weren't.
[57:28.300 --> 57:30.660]  I was like, yeah, Gab won't be around. Or Dan will be in town or something.
[57:31.760 --> 57:33.000]  Could have wrote me a letter.
[57:34.220 --> 57:35.440]  I could have also texted you.
[57:36.160 --> 57:36.780]  That's true.
[57:37.920 --> 57:45.280]  I'm not complaining. I'm just saying I found out quickly that a week can feel like a hell of a lot longer than a week.
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.360]  So a month for Andrew could be like a year.
[57:48.020 --> 57:49.240]  Depending on what he does with it.
[57:49.380 --> 57:50.500]  Yeah, it's just the time.
[57:50.820 --> 57:54.460]  There are certain weeks that are extremely long and other weeks that go by immediately.
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.980]  I feel like Andrew and myself have hardly been talking.
[58:00.720 --> 58:03.060]  Ever since the end of Survive Block Island.
[58:05.300 --> 58:08.360]  People are going to make a lot of assumptions about that segment.
[58:08.680 --> 58:09.700]  We don't play Halo anymore.
[58:10.240 --> 58:10.820]  We should.
[58:11.180 --> 58:12.620]  I mean, this is episode 117.
[58:12.800 --> 58:14.620]  This is? We should play Halo.
[58:15.240 --> 58:19.660]  I've done every weekly challenge since Halo Infinite released.
[58:20.000 --> 58:20.900]  I'm still doing that.
[58:21.220 --> 58:22.500]  And Co-op still isn't out.
[58:22.880 --> 58:26.500]  Co-op still isn't out. Forge isn't out yet, but that looks like it's coming out soon.
[58:26.600 --> 58:28.920]  And some of the stuff people have built in it is insane.
[58:28.920 --> 58:35.460]  A lot of people wanted us to try and do Halo 2 Lasso without dying.
[58:37.660 --> 58:42.360]  No, I didn't think that would ever be done. It's amazing that somebody did it.
[58:42.620 --> 58:43.920]  Has it been done now?
[58:44.280 --> 58:47.780]  Yeah, somebody did it last week and it was the person that was the closest.
[58:47.960 --> 58:50.580]  I think it took them like 8 hours or 7 hours.
[58:50.780 --> 58:53.320]  How is that possible?
[58:53.320 --> 58:58.920]  It's only been done on the original Halo 2 Xbox version.
[58:59.080 --> 59:04.060]  Because there's something with the frame rate that prevents the ability to shoot frequently.
[59:04.400 --> 59:07.380]  There's a slower firing rate on the old console.
[59:07.840 --> 59:12.420]  So I don't think anyone's been able to do it on the Master Chief Collection, which has a higher firing rate.
[59:13.320 --> 59:15.480]  But it's a lot of glitches and jumps.
[59:16.440 --> 59:19.320]  It's just a guy that put in a lot of practice ahead of time.
[59:19.460 --> 59:22.480]  I think his thing was speedrunning Halo 2.
[59:22.480 --> 59:24.600]  I could be wrong. I don't know a lot about the person that did it.
[59:24.880 --> 59:28.900]  I just can't imagine being in the boss fight for regret.
[59:29.580 --> 59:34.120]  Where you have to climb on and punch him in the face and there's elites all underneath you.
[59:34.440 --> 59:36.940]  And then if I die there, I'm back at Cairo Station.
[59:37.160 --> 59:39.220]  I can't get my head around that feeling.
[59:39.800 --> 59:42.620]  I can't imagine beating Cairo Station.
[59:43.580 --> 59:47.560]  Yeah, a very small percentage even accomplished that.
[59:47.720 --> 59:52.100]  It's an insane feat that the person accomplished.
[59:52.100 --> 59:52.820]  It's amazing.
[59:52.840 --> 59:56.380]  Well, congratulations to streamer Jervalin.
[59:56.720 --> 59:57.920]  I think it's Jervalin.
[59:58.580 --> 59:59.100]  Jervalin.
[59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.100]  I'm going to go with...
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.760]  Down in Alabama, where I'm from, we say Jervalin.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:11.300]  You can be Jervalin all you want, but if you're coming to my neck of the woods, you're Jervalin.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.120]  Well, that was nice.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.280]  That was fun.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.600]  I'm excited to do one more right now.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.920]  Oh yeah, we got to roll right into the next one right now.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.460]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:31.080]  This episode is dedicated to Guilty Spark, obviously.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.900]  That's a Halo reference, if you don't know what that is.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.560]  Oh, you know one thing we mentioned, I was going to say, tune in.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:43.860]  Keep your eyes peeled because Does It Do will be coming out at some point on our YouTube channel and on RoosterTeeth.com.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.280]  It is not an audio podcast. It is a video show, about 10 minutes long.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.100]  We'll let you know.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:56.840]  But in addition to that, I feel like we should say, because I've seen people asking about it, and people are going like, they haven't mentioned it since they initially talked about it.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.380]  The animated f*** faces are coming.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:00.680]  There, it's dated.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:07.540]  We have a release date. I don't know if it's been announced. I don't know if I should give that release date because these things tend to slip.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:17.920]  But we have, we have, there are multiple episodes in the pipeline. We've seen two or three, and they're fantastic, and they're really, really awesome.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.680]  And they've done an amazing job making us look funny and like humans, real humans.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.380]  And so those will be some of us.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:34.800]  By the way, the animated pickle one, the pickles on Gavin's porch, that's one of the episodes, that's one of the stories.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.720]  Eric in that episode is maybe my favorite thing.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.280]  I cannot wait till that one's done.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.880]  Anyway, so those will be coming out soon too, probably, I don't know, in the next month or so.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.340]  So keep your eyes peeled for that.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.100]  And bye.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.400]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.980]  Someone lost their audio. Let the in-cap challenge begin.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.320]  Andrew bends the rules yet again.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.220]  The boys have to explain to Patton what an in-cap is.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.840]  Geoff can't spell marshmallow.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.180]  Gavin absolutely destroys his wall.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.980]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.840]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
