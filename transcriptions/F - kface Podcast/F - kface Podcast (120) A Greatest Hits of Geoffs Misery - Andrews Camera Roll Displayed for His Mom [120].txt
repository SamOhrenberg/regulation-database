[00:15.180 --> 00:19.360]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:19.980 --> 00:23.120]  It's the 120th time these idiots have talked.
[00:23.240 --> 00:26.520]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton.
[00:27.180 --> 00:29.620]  First off, I'm just going to get it out of the way right now.
[00:30.220 --> 00:32.220]  F*** my life and f*** my body.
[00:32.580 --> 00:33.360]  How are you guys doing?
[00:33.660 --> 00:34.700]  My dude, dude!
[00:35.020 --> 00:38.000]  Oh, how am I the most healthy one of the three?
[00:38.080 --> 00:40.100]  This has never happened. This is a rare event.
[00:40.240 --> 00:41.380]  Are you at 100% right now?
[00:41.380 --> 00:42.560]  Yeah, I feel pretty good.
[00:42.680 --> 00:43.140]  How's your ankle?
[00:43.520 --> 00:44.720]  100%. Still 100.
[00:44.900 --> 00:45.060]  F***.
[00:45.320 --> 00:48.420]  So it's it. Your ankle is it. You could walk a marathon.
[00:48.740 --> 00:50.400]  I could, potentially. Hypothetically.
[00:50.620 --> 00:53.500]  But as we said, I'm enjoying this 100% lifestyle for a little bit.
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.620]  Ask me the same question.
[00:54.820 --> 00:56.000]  Gavin, how are you doing, man?
[00:56.480 --> 00:57.680]  What percentage are you?
[00:57.880 --> 00:59.360]  Specifically ask about my ankles.
[00:59.820 --> 01:00.640]  Gavin, how are your ankles?
[01:01.080 --> 01:02.200]  About 50%.
[01:03.440 --> 01:04.320]  What happened?
[01:04.560 --> 01:08.280]  I think it was like two weeks ago, Eric said I was the Andrew of that podcast.
[01:08.800 --> 01:10.700]  Probably in the extra medium. Bullshit.
[01:10.700 --> 01:13.740]  Yeah, I'm definitely the Andrew of I have bad ankles.
[01:13.940 --> 01:17.500]  Oh, no. Well, at 50%, would you say your ankles are extra medium?
[01:17.860 --> 01:19.640]  I'd say they couldn't get more medium than that.
[01:20.620 --> 01:29.400]  Man, listen, before we get off on an aside, the extra medium thing really blew up in a way I did not anticipate.
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.600]  God damn, man.
[01:30.700 --> 01:31.840]  I have never seen.
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.020]  Nothing but extra medium shit for the last week, a couple days of my life.
[01:37.020 --> 01:41.760]  I've never seen so many regulation listeners turn in their comment leaver cards.
[01:41.940 --> 01:46.220]  I saw people saying they were becoming comment leavers just for this conversation.
[01:46.580 --> 01:50.700]  I saw people responding to those people who became comment leavers just for that.
[01:50.860 --> 01:52.500]  It was like an infection.
[01:52.940 --> 01:58.740]  This is like, man, this might be the most commented thing since maybe the pencil or condiments.
[01:58.840 --> 01:59.460]  It's been wild.
[01:59.980 --> 02:02.440]  But Gavin, why are your ankles at 50%?
[02:02.440 --> 02:03.920]  50% means you're in a cast, maybe.
[02:04.040 --> 02:04.580]  What's going on?
[02:06.780 --> 02:10.620]  Well, I'm getting the hockey teeth in my wall fixed.
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.500]  I had to move my desk, but the desk is really heavy, like without anything on it.
[02:16.740 --> 02:18.320]  And also, I didn't want to take everything off it.
[02:18.640 --> 02:24.220]  So I just thought, you know, I'll lift up one side, sort of shimmy it round, lift up the other side, keep doing that a few times.
[02:24.980 --> 02:29.360]  And I did one side, the side without, you know, just has like a printer on that side of the legs.
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.840]  The other side has like a big hard drive, big server thing, a big RAID and my PC.
[02:34.640 --> 02:36.540]  So I thought, oh, this one's going to be a bit more serious.
[02:37.140 --> 02:38.820]  And I gave it a few little test lifts.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  I was like, OK, I think my arms and back can take it.
[02:41.600 --> 02:42.160]  Here we go.
[02:42.420 --> 02:44.360]  And I just hoisted the whole thing up.
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.240]  Instead of lifting the table up, I sank down about two inches as both of my ankles rolled.
[02:51.180 --> 02:53.460]  And I just ended up just like twisted outwards.
[02:53.460 --> 02:58.920]  I just didn't ever consider my ankles to be the point of failure.
[02:59.080 --> 03:05.180]  And I think it's to do with the fact that I'm still, you know, I'm still recovering from the pelvic injury from Does It Do?
[03:05.280 --> 03:08.420]  So I maybe wasn't stood as straight as I usually am.
[03:08.920 --> 03:12.120]  And I just, I did not expect to go downwards.
[03:12.980 --> 03:20.620]  And I ended up just rolling around on the floor once again, contemplating my age and career choices.
[03:20.840 --> 03:21.560]  Can you walk?
[03:21.560 --> 03:24.080]  Yeah, but you know, it kind of hurts too.
[03:24.180 --> 03:27.100]  Like I still go on walks and stuff, but I just, it starts hurting sooner.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.740]  I just need like an MOT.
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.700]  I just need a look, a look over from a doctor.
[03:31.060 --> 03:31.720]  I need x-rays.
[03:31.980 --> 03:33.320]  Does one side hurt more than the other?
[03:34.200 --> 03:36.540]  Is one ankle, ankle worse than the other ankle?
[03:36.800 --> 03:39.280]  No, it's a pretty even pop across both.
[03:39.440 --> 03:49.080]  I think instead of, instead of going down to a 0% on one ankle, like breaking it, it just split the damage across both.
[03:49.080 --> 03:56.100]  I think you're saying the word pop for effect, but when you say it, I feel like I heard like...
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.780]  It was probably the most bone cracks I've heard from my body ever.
[04:02.940 --> 04:04.940]  Because it was both ankles at the same time.
[04:05.080 --> 04:05.660]  It was deafening.
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.420]  I, I'm gonna, these hockey teeth are troubling me and I'll tell you why.
[04:10.740 --> 04:14.000]  I tried really hard to, as a friend, to help this process.
[04:14.220 --> 04:18.480]  I just got the impression you didn't want my help or my presence at any point.
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.880]  I could have helped you move this table, man.
[04:21.040 --> 04:23.680]  I spent four hours moving back into my bedroom last night.
[04:23.740 --> 04:24.500]  I can do it.
[04:24.660 --> 04:27.260]  Yeah, and I thought, you know, it would be really fun to try and fix the wall.
[04:27.320 --> 04:31.920]  But then I realized that the people who hacked it to pieces were more than happy to repair it.
[04:31.980 --> 04:33.920]  So I thought, oh, I might as well take the free repair.
[04:34.180 --> 04:35.600]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
[04:35.880 --> 04:37.280]  I just had to move my desk.
[04:37.440 --> 04:43.020]  In the end, after about eight hours of not being able to walk good, I came back to my desk.
[04:43.200 --> 04:45.760]  I took everything off it and I moved it with great ease.
[04:46.520 --> 04:47.240]  Wow. Fantastic.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.200]  So I'm trying to... I'm visualizing... I don't know.
[04:50.260 --> 04:55.080]  Do you remember in old wrestling games, in like the top left corner, there's the outline of the human body?
[04:55.540 --> 04:58.960]  And as areas get hurt more, it becomes, like, increasingly red?
[04:59.300 --> 05:02.840]  So right now, I'm just seeing you with, like, deep red ankles.
[05:03.300 --> 05:06.020]  Is that the only issue? Where else in the body...
[05:06.020 --> 05:07.540]  Because it sounds like you both are in trouble.
[05:07.900 --> 05:09.360]  Imagine that...
[05:12.050 --> 05:13.030]  What happened to Gavin?
[05:13.270 --> 05:14.070]  What happened to both of you?
[05:14.450 --> 05:17.030]  We're here. Gavin started talking.
[05:17.030 --> 05:18.610]  Do you think his computer restarted?
[05:18.850 --> 05:19.930]  You can't hear me anymore?
[05:20.090 --> 05:22.570]  No, you're back. You stopped talking.
[05:22.610 --> 05:25.230]  We're a technical difficulties podcast. We were just talking about this.
[05:25.230 --> 05:28.330]  No, we're not. We're not a technical difficulties podcast.
[05:28.990 --> 05:30.950]  Yeah, I said... What I said was... What did I say?
[05:31.070 --> 05:35.970]  I said, yeah, imagine you're playing Doom and my ankles are the Doom guy and they both have nosebleeds.
[05:36.210 --> 05:36.890]  I said something like that.
[05:38.270 --> 05:39.930]  Okay. That's a wild visual.
[05:40.370 --> 05:43.450]  Okay. Oh, I see. There's a screen. The old Doom.
[05:43.510 --> 05:44.370]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:44.390 --> 05:45.770]  Where the health... I get it. Okay. I understood.
[05:45.770 --> 05:46.990]  Yeah, when he gets all like...
[05:46.990 --> 05:47.610]  Original Doom.
[05:49.070 --> 05:51.990]  I'm sure my original delivery was better than me trying to remember what I just said.
[05:52.010 --> 05:54.970]  No, but what about your upper? Because you had the other injuries from before.
[05:55.050 --> 05:59.070]  So we got like a yellow midsection. What's going on on the rest of the scale?
[05:59.190 --> 06:02.470]  Yeah, it's Amber on the left hip. I'm probably at 80%.
[06:02.470 --> 06:03.330]  Oh, yeah. Pit boy.
[06:04.310 --> 06:07.930]  So I'd say, yeah, both ankles crippled and a left hip.
[06:08.370 --> 06:09.770]  Left hip's just got like half a bar.
[06:10.990 --> 06:12.930]  Okay. How about you, Geoff? What's going on with you?
[06:13.870 --> 06:15.090]  Well, mine's a whole thing.
[06:15.090 --> 06:21.150]  I feel like we're running through a greatest hits of Geoff's misery in the last week.
[06:21.390 --> 06:21.570]  I don't know.
[06:21.690 --> 06:23.690]  I was talking about this with Eric the other day.
[06:24.170 --> 06:30.350]  Well, first off, I think I had just had the bike wreck after when I saw you guys last time and when we recorded last time.
[06:30.590 --> 06:36.610]  I was apparently running on adrenaline and the excitement of having a story to tell.
[06:36.990 --> 06:40.510]  Everything went downhill pretty much from that night on.
[06:40.510 --> 06:45.370]  I don't remember what the situation, what the living arrangements were at that point.
[06:45.890 --> 06:50.790]  But there's just been a confluence of just fucking myself right in the butthole.
[06:50.990 --> 06:52.890]  Well, what was it that Eric wrote on Slack?
[06:53.250 --> 07:01.550]  Yeah, that was the big turn because before last time when we left off, there was discussion around that you were going to hit a bunch of baseballs tomorrow morning.
[07:01.730 --> 07:02.610]  Yeah, that's not happening.
[07:02.610 --> 07:11.370]  Yeah, this was on the 26th of August. Eric in the face Slack wrote, hey, after seeing Geoff today, there's no way we're hitting baseballs.
[07:11.810 --> 07:12.330]  Yeah.
[07:12.630 --> 07:13.790]  Which is tomorrow now.
[07:14.050 --> 07:16.030]  I'm walking again, so that's good.
[07:17.610 --> 07:21.090]  That's your status update is that you were walking again?
[07:21.270 --> 07:22.890]  Yeah, I'm walking again fairly well.
[07:23.590 --> 07:25.650]  I don't think I'm hitting baseballs or anything.
[07:26.550 --> 07:27.770]  We'll just go from there.
[07:27.770 --> 07:33.410]  So for the bike rack, the ankle, it turns out it was very, very sprained and that was real bad.
[07:34.250 --> 07:36.310]  The knee scabbed up real hard.
[07:37.410 --> 07:45.190]  And do you guys ever I don't know if you were scabby boys when you were growing up, but I always I was always falling into something and getting covered in scabs.
[07:45.490 --> 07:53.930]  And you know how like when you you get a scab on an elbow or a knee when you're a kid and then if you get up or sit down too fast or bend your arm too fast, it cracks the scab in half.
[07:54.010 --> 07:56.610]  Yeah, I'm doing that a couple times a day right now.
[07:56.610 --> 07:59.570]  So it's like it just feels like it's never going to end.
[07:59.790 --> 08:04.450]  And it's just like any time I move the scab on my knee cracks and it's excruciating.
[08:05.130 --> 08:07.770]  And so the whole left side of my body is pretty sore.
[08:08.170 --> 08:10.870]  I don't know if it's Gavin sore, but it's pretty fucking sore.
[08:11.950 --> 08:20.250]  It was compounded by the fact that I don't know if this had happened yet, but, you know, I was having having the dudes come in and work on the house, fixing up the bedroom.
[08:20.250 --> 08:26.650]  And I may have even made a joke about how I thought it was going to take like two days and it was probably going to take much longer.
[08:27.090 --> 08:30.250]  Well, I moved back into my bedroom last night, which was wonderful.
[08:31.590 --> 08:40.270]  But I underestimated how difficult my life would be being kicked out of my own bedroom for a week, like not able to go in at all.
[08:41.210 --> 08:51.390]  Because it was like a clean room because they were having to like de-texture the ceiling and then re-tape and float and put the whatever the shit on the ceiling is to smooth it out.
[08:51.490 --> 08:57.690]  And it took I mean, they were fucking work until like seven, eight, nine, ten midnight night for last every night.
[08:58.250 --> 09:02.310]  And I just didn't have access to my bedroom, which means I didn't have access to my closet.
[09:02.510 --> 09:06.650]  I wasn't ready for that. I didn't know when the first guy walked in and said, hey, what's up?
[09:06.650 --> 09:10.130]  I'm Dave. I got muscles and tattoos and I'm going to put the trim on your wall.
[09:10.330 --> 09:16.110]  I didn't know that from that point on, I would have no access to my clothes or anything I owned really.
[09:17.130 --> 09:24.190]  And so I have been living in one pair of shorts, two pairs of underwear, a pair of socks and three shirts that I just happened to have in my laundry.
[09:24.210 --> 09:25.510]  But you couldn't just nip in there?
[09:25.510 --> 09:38.450]  Well, no, it's my closet was boarded up like the whole room was taped off very heavily because they did the walls first and then the ceiling.
[09:38.570 --> 09:42.890]  And it was it's all been ceiling work since. So it was all like taped off in a way.
[09:43.250 --> 09:52.110]  And then like the scaffolding and stuff, which is very heavy, was pushed against it so I could nip into the room, but I couldn't by myself move the scaffolding or any of that stuff.
[09:52.890 --> 09:59.210]  So I've been living like that for a week, just doing laundry every night, which is fine. I can live with that.
[09:59.310 --> 10:02.090]  You could just nip to Target and get a few sets of undies.
[10:02.270 --> 10:07.670]  Yeah, Geoff is maybe the funniest person to have this happen to you because you have a fucking clothing line.
[10:07.970 --> 10:12.430]  You have a whole extensive shirt collection based around you.
[10:12.690 --> 10:17.710]  I gotta start making underwear. I have tons of clothes. I just didn't have access to them.
[10:17.930 --> 10:20.730]  But I did have some stuff in the dirty clothes, so I made it work.
[10:20.730 --> 10:25.890]  I make I improvise. I make it work. It's fine. I adapt. I overcome. I was in the military. I know how to do it.
[10:26.370 --> 10:34.210]  But that that like not having access to your stuff. Also, this is gonna sound really lame, but I have two stress relievers in my life right now that I don't drink.
[10:34.510 --> 10:39.590]  I have bicycles out of the question. There's no way I can't get on my bike right now.
[10:39.870 --> 10:42.130]  So my backup is baseball cards, right?
[10:42.930 --> 10:51.390]  When I get stressed out, I organize my baseball cards. I sleeve stuff. All locked up in the closet. No access to any of that shit.
[10:51.970 --> 10:53.390]  It was all in the closet with the clothes, right?
[10:53.550 --> 10:54.190]  Oh no!
[10:54.590 --> 11:02.870]  So I just had no way to relieve stress. Friday, Saturday, I was in bed. I couldn't really get out. I had to have my leg elevated. It was swollen.
[11:03.670 --> 11:06.010]  So my whole weekend was basically fucked.
[11:06.010 --> 11:13.630]  And then bed, I don't know if this had happened yet, but we had to move my king-size mattress and everything, our bed, into the library.
[11:13.770 --> 11:15.090]  It was the only room in the house we could fit it.
[11:15.450 --> 11:17.230]  And it's a much warmer room as well, right?
[11:17.490 --> 11:24.130]  Oh yeah. Well, I found out that, first off, this side of the house is unbearably hot. The air conditioner doesn't work for shit over here.
[11:26.270 --> 11:34.130]  And I knew that. I knew that because they had told me that. And they told me it was unfixable because of the way my ceiling is built without ripping out my whole ceiling.
[11:34.130 --> 11:38.690]  And now that I have ripped out a ceiling, I have no desire to do that again anytime soon, let me tell you.
[11:39.010 --> 11:40.570]  But I hadn't experienced it.
[11:40.870 --> 11:49.250]  But now I spend a week living on a mattress on the floor like I'm in college again, where I have to very carefully get out of my side.
[11:49.490 --> 11:55.730]  Because one inch away from the bed is this desk and this chair and all of this equipment.
[11:56.070 --> 12:03.090]  And I sprained my ankle three or four more times just trying to get up to pee in the middle of the night, trying to get through the jinga of this room.
[12:03.090 --> 12:06.170]  So like I was in a box, incredibly uncomfortable.
[12:06.470 --> 12:17.370]  Another thing you don't think about when you displace yourself in your own home and have complete strangers in your house, half of your house for eight to twelve hours a day every day.
[12:17.890 --> 12:28.390]  For some reason, every spot in this house that I could stand or sit or occupy space in has a direct line view to those guys.
[12:29.350 --> 12:35.850]  Now that they were watching me, just like every time I turn around, no matter what room I'm in, they can see me and I can see them.
[12:36.050 --> 12:41.110]  And it's just really discombobulating to feel like, even though these guys don't give a fuck about me, they're busy doing their job.
[12:41.510 --> 12:46.390]  But just to feel like every time I turn around, there's dudes I can see people, like a window away from me.
[12:46.510 --> 12:48.030]  And there's nothing I can do about it.
[12:48.230 --> 12:51.650]  So I just felt like I was in a fishbowl for a fucking week.
[12:53.030 --> 12:56.810]  Then, night before last, god damn, I was fucking done with it.
[12:57.010 --> 13:02.010]  And the guys were like, it's gonna take another day to finish the ceiling, it's taking longer than we thought.
[13:02.390 --> 13:04.010]  And Emily was like, nah, get it done tonight.
[13:04.190 --> 13:06.470]  We got the painter coming in tomorrow, cause that's a whole other thing.
[13:06.810 --> 13:08.690]  The guy that does the trim doesn't do paint.
[13:08.770 --> 13:12.710]  The guy that does the ceiling paints the ceiling, but doesn't paint trim.
[13:12.910 --> 13:15.290]  So we gotta bring in another guy who paints trim.
[13:15.670 --> 13:20.610]  I'm pretty sure I'm in some sort of a scam, but whatever, it's fine.
[13:20.610 --> 13:24.670]  You do what you gotta do in Austin to get people into your house to fix stuff.
[13:24.830 --> 13:27.430]  Because every house in Austin is under construction.
[13:27.590 --> 13:34.070]  And if anybody that's been in Austin and has driven through one block of a neighborhood can see that every house in Austin is under construction right now.
[13:35.810 --> 13:39.770]  These were like the 20th people we tried to get to even come in to do this job.
[13:40.230 --> 13:43.070]  So it's like, fuck it, whatever, we'll hire a third guy to paint the trim.
[13:43.230 --> 13:45.910]  And thank god he did, cause he was lovely and a Boston Celtics fan.
[13:46.310 --> 13:49.450]  But anyway, so I was ready to go to bed at like 9 o'clock night before last.
[13:49.450 --> 13:55.010]  And we had these giant picture windows in the library that look right into the picture windows in the bedroom.
[13:55.690 --> 13:57.750]  And those guys, Emily wouldn't let them leave until they finished.
[13:57.930 --> 13:59.370]  They didn't finish until after midnight.
[13:59.970 --> 14:05.570]  And so I just, and I couldn't like, I'm not gonna lay in my bed in front of them and try to go to sleep.
[14:06.490 --> 14:08.770]  So I was kept awake, which really sucked too.
[14:09.190 --> 14:14.650]  So I've just been like, I guess you would describe it as depressed. I don't know.
[14:15.230 --> 14:17.450]  Emily made sure I saw my therapist this week.
[14:17.450 --> 14:18.870]  She said I wasn't doing well.
[14:19.550 --> 14:21.230]  But that's not all the bad stuff.
[14:22.410 --> 14:24.710]  So all that has just been put, that's put me in a state.
[14:24.850 --> 14:25.650]  Yeah, a bit of a low.
[14:25.990 --> 14:27.050]  The jock itch persists.
[14:27.350 --> 14:27.870]  Oh no!
[14:28.790 --> 14:29.610]  It's never ending.
[14:29.850 --> 14:30.490]  Oh my god.
[14:30.510 --> 14:34.330]  It got so bad, I contacted the doctor this morning and I'm like, listen.
[14:35.490 --> 14:39.010]  I tried two different rounds of pills with you guys, two different kinds of creams.
[14:39.250 --> 14:40.930]  I'm still getting cream.
[14:41.070 --> 14:45.910]  As a matter of fact, I ran out of the cream you gave me, but I had a refill, so I just filled it myself and kept going.
[14:45.910 --> 14:50.970]  I'm trying to be patient with this thing, but what else can we do?
[14:51.410 --> 14:53.990]  And they were like, keep at it, put more cream on.
[14:55.270 --> 14:56.070]  Oh no!
[14:56.550 --> 14:59.350]  Did you tell them it might be some sort of virus from the lake?
[15:01.390 --> 15:04.070]  I mean, I went there and physically showed it to them.
[15:04.150 --> 15:07.390]  The doctor looked at it and he goes, yeah, that's jock itch.
[15:07.430 --> 15:08.730]  That's tinea, as it's called.
[15:09.190 --> 15:12.330]  But they're kicking my itch can down the road.
[15:12.330 --> 15:20.370]  The left side of my body is inflamed and exhausted, and every time I stand up or sit down, I crack a scab and yellow pus drips out.
[15:20.550 --> 15:21.270]  And then it has to reform.
[15:22.330 --> 15:23.670]  And it's just brutal.
[15:23.970 --> 15:26.050]  And then the right side of my body is on fire.
[15:26.630 --> 15:29.090]  And so I'm just incredibly uncomfortable in my own skin.
[15:29.590 --> 15:35.050]  And then last night we moved back into the room, and it was like four hours of lifting heavy furniture.
[15:35.250 --> 15:40.830]  And so today I woke up to just every bit of arthritis in my body was mad at me.
[15:40.830 --> 15:43.590]  And so I could barely stand because of my spine.
[15:43.710 --> 15:44.870]  It just fucking sucked.
[15:45.450 --> 15:50.390]  And Emily says she can tell when I'm not doing well because she'll walk into a room and I just have my head in my hands.
[15:50.610 --> 15:51.970]  And I don't realize I'm doing that.
[15:52.470 --> 15:53.410]  Oh my god.
[15:53.810 --> 15:56.490]  She said that every time she walks into a room, I have my head in my hands.
[15:56.590 --> 15:59.530]  Which is why she was like, be sure to go to therapy this week and talk about this.
[15:59.990 --> 16:00.410]  So I did.
[16:01.310 --> 16:06.350]  But out of all that, we've got Geoff's body falling apart, bike wreck.
[16:06.350 --> 16:10.550]  What would be one other classic thing that happens to me that we could throw into the mix?
[16:10.670 --> 16:12.070]  House is clearly an issue.
[16:12.690 --> 16:15.950]  I'll let you guess real quickly, and then if nobody's going to get it, I'll just...
[16:16.470 --> 16:17.970]  A baseball card fire.
[16:18.410 --> 16:19.090]  Baseball card fire?
[16:19.550 --> 16:22.350]  The fridge that you're not going to get a replacement for.
[16:23.270 --> 16:24.310]  Fridge is a great one.
[16:24.830 --> 16:26.510]  I picked up Millie from school Monday.
[16:26.890 --> 16:28.430]  We needed to go to the grocery store.
[16:29.890 --> 16:31.170]  And so I'm like, okay.
[16:31.450 --> 16:35.670]  So head up to the grocery store, stop at the stoplight before the grocery store.
[16:35.670 --> 16:37.290]  Bam! Rear-ended.
[16:37.750 --> 16:38.670]  Come on.
[16:38.950 --> 16:41.390]  Bam! Rear-ended. I got fucking rear-ended.
[16:42.130 --> 16:49.690]  Less than a month after I got my car back from when I fucked it up, and then they took it to get it certified, and then they got into an accident.
[16:50.070 --> 16:54.610]  I get rear-ended again, which is still less than like six months from when Millie got rear-ended.
[16:54.910 --> 16:57.170]  My car's been in three accidents this year.
[16:57.490 --> 16:59.410]  What does everyone have against my car?
[16:59.890 --> 17:02.330]  I have no-I-fucking-dia, dude.
[17:04.010 --> 17:07.470]  I mean, my car's drivable, but it's all fucked up in the back.
[17:07.670 --> 17:15.910]  And I gotta go through this process again, where the only place that'll fix my kind of car, that still gets certified by BMW, is 40 minutes away.
[17:16.110 --> 17:19.870]  And you gotta go down there and take the car to them, and then they'll evaluate it.
[17:19.990 --> 17:21.690]  And then they won't let you leave it there.
[17:21.950 --> 17:26.030]  Then you gotta go back home and wait two weeks, and I'm in that process again.
[17:26.250 --> 17:31.650]  And I was so fucking excited to be done and have a fucking healthy car again.
[17:31.650 --> 17:36.610]  To now immediately be starting at scratch all over again.
[17:36.950 --> 17:39.650]  I still haven't even been able to-still going through insurance.
[17:39.890 --> 17:43.930]  I still haven't even been able to take it to get evaluated to see how much it's gonna cost to repair.
[17:44.270 --> 17:47.590]  I'm so fucking done with this life! Oh my god!
[17:47.750 --> 17:50.390]  That is an endless stream of shit.
[17:51.210 --> 17:54.710]  This might be the worst week ever on f***face that we've heard from you.
[17:54.830 --> 17:56.430]  It's like Groundhog's Day, man.
[17:57.050 --> 17:59.290]  I just... I don't know, I don't know.
[17:59.290 --> 18:04.050]  And I'll be honest with you, there's a little bit of joy in hearing your misery, Gav.
[18:04.410 --> 18:07.690]  And it probably would've felt a little better if Andrew had something bad happen too.
[18:07.790 --> 18:09.450]  Because then it's like, you know, misery loves company.
[18:09.670 --> 18:11.430]  I'm a pretty miserable guy.
[18:12.230 --> 18:13.630]  But, uh...
[18:13.630 --> 18:18.610]  Now I'm just imagining you in the front seat of your smashed-in car with your head in your hands.
[18:19.750 --> 18:21.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:21.570 --> 18:22.570]  I'm just like...
[18:22.570 --> 18:23.050]  Did it hurt?
[18:23.410 --> 18:25.990]  Uh, nah. I mean, I had a headache.
[18:26.210 --> 18:27.670]  Millie had a headache, I had a sore neck.
[18:27.830 --> 18:28.750]  But it was fine.
[18:28.750 --> 18:31.150]  Was it some twat on their phone?
[18:31.750 --> 18:32.850]  No, I felt so bad.
[18:32.890 --> 18:36.150]  It was one of, like... I'm pretty sure it was one of Millie's high school classmates.
[18:36.710 --> 18:39.670]  She was a kid. She was really sweet and terrified.
[18:40.490 --> 18:42.890]  And I felt bad for her. I ended up trying to comfort her.
[18:42.990 --> 18:44.410]  I'm like, listen, this is your first accident.
[18:44.890 --> 18:47.590]  And she's like, I'm like, is it your car or your parents' car?
[18:47.690 --> 18:49.350]  She's like, it's my car, my parents pay for it.
[18:49.350 --> 18:50.050]  And I'm like, that's okay.
[18:50.190 --> 18:54.530]  And then she's like, you know, I'm like, you're not hurt, I'm not hurt, we can both drive away.
[18:54.870 --> 18:58.230]  This is, like, if you're gonna get into an accident, this is the first accident to get into.
[18:58.230 --> 19:01.310]  Don't worry, my car gets rear-ended once a month.
[19:01.470 --> 19:05.230]  This happens to me six, seven times a year, apparently, so...
[19:06.050 --> 19:08.830]  Sign my book of people who have rear-ended me this year.
[19:10.270 --> 19:12.150]  Yeah, this is my car wreck book.
[19:12.870 --> 19:14.050]  Just, like, read a little note, maybe.
[19:14.890 --> 19:19.150]  You know, so I'm feeling... I'll be honest with you guys.
[19:19.470 --> 19:21.930]  I'm feeling kind of defeated right now.
[19:22.150 --> 19:25.330]  I love the idea of, like, a hotel guest book for your car.
[19:25.330 --> 19:30.970]  And everyone is just, like, a bunch of blank lines, and you just get people to sign in every time they hit you.
[19:31.130 --> 19:32.530]  I think it's a problem of space, though.
[19:32.630 --> 19:36.310]  There's no book big enough that could fit the volume that Geoff gets hit.
[19:36.890 --> 19:39.030]  We're gonna constantly be needing new paper.
[19:39.470 --> 19:41.090]  All these dates and names.
[19:41.510 --> 19:45.670]  There are demolition derby vehicles that have had less impact than your car, Gavin.
[19:45.890 --> 19:47.370]  It is ridiculous.
[19:47.850 --> 19:51.770]  My car has been hit, through no fault of its own, three times this year.
[19:51.950 --> 19:54.390]  Three fucking times this year.
[19:54.390 --> 19:56.670]  How is that possible?
[19:57.190 --> 19:59.530]  That's a lot. That's an excessive amount.
[19:59.710 --> 20:01.890]  Yeah, it's like we're magnetized to assholes.
[20:03.590 --> 20:04.310]  That sucks.
[20:04.710 --> 20:05.830]  That's my update.
[20:06.130 --> 20:08.490]  So to put a positive spin, you're back in your room.
[20:08.710 --> 20:11.070]  Yeah, I slept in my own bedroom last night. It was wonderful.
[20:11.230 --> 20:13.990]  And the room is fucking gorgeous. I'll send you guys a picture.
[20:14.470 --> 20:17.030]  Let's see a picture, like a post-shelf picture.
[20:17.350 --> 20:19.670]  Yeah, here you go. Let me see if I took any.
[20:20.270 --> 20:21.430]  I did. Okay, here.
[20:21.430 --> 20:23.190]  Oh, that looks so cool.
[20:23.410 --> 20:24.530]  Yeah, that's worth it.
[20:24.570 --> 20:26.910]  Is that the best picture that Geoff has ever taken?
[20:27.490 --> 20:32.770]  It looks like, honestly, a photo of a five-star hotel room.
[20:32.910 --> 20:36.830]  Geoff, did you take that photo?
[20:37.290 --> 20:38.310]  I did, I did, I did.
[20:39.010 --> 20:40.570]  That's what happens when I try to take a photo.
[20:40.710 --> 20:44.950]  I will say, I'm genuinely impressed by your photo-taking skills here.
[20:45.070 --> 20:46.110]  That's an incredible photo.
[20:46.530 --> 20:47.470]  On the wide lens?
[20:47.790 --> 20:49.230]  Yeah, it's on the .5 or whatever.
[20:49.230 --> 20:52.890]  The only thing is I didn't take the laundry off the little bench in front of the bed before I took it.
[20:53.150 --> 20:54.830]  You can see some dirty laundry there.
[20:55.050 --> 20:56.230]  But I was just excited to have laundry.
[20:56.650 --> 20:58.050]  Anyway, so that's what my bedroom looks like.
[20:58.290 --> 21:02.610]  I don't know if you can really see the stuff on the walls, but it's all painted the same color.
[21:02.730 --> 21:03.770]  The ceiling is painted the same color.
[21:04.310 --> 21:05.490]  It is worth it.
[21:06.790 --> 21:07.990]  It's totally worth it.
[21:08.090 --> 21:10.170]  I'm scrolling up to the photo you took before.
[21:10.310 --> 21:11.910]  It looks like an entirely different room.
[21:12.310 --> 21:16.210]  It's amazing how much of an impact those choices you did made.
[21:16.210 --> 21:17.590]  I'm real jazzed.
[21:17.870 --> 21:19.230]  Thank you so much.
[21:20.070 --> 21:25.510]  And thank you to the fleet of people that were required to do that.
[21:25.910 --> 21:27.930]  Like the seven different companies or whatever we had to hire.
[21:28.390 --> 21:30.850]  Yeah, that part's nice.
[21:30.930 --> 21:34.630]  At least now I'm convalescing in my bed in my space.
[21:35.330 --> 21:37.270]  And I do appreciate that.
[21:37.730 --> 21:40.470]  Also, man, this fucking...
[21:40.470 --> 21:45.590]  First off, a lot of people approaching me this week telling us we owe Andrew's mom an apology.
[21:47.970 --> 21:50.730]  We record these pretty far in advance, FYI.
[21:51.010 --> 21:56.670]  We had already recorded the follow-up episode to this when last week's episode hit.
[21:56.790 --> 21:58.750]  The Extra Medium and the End Cap episode hit.
[21:59.250 --> 22:06.870]  So Andrew and I both had already changed our minds and agreed with Gavin in the previous...
[22:06.870 --> 22:08.550]  The audience hasn't even heard the episode yet.
[22:08.590 --> 22:11.210]  And we've definitely apologized to Andrew's mom at this point.
[22:11.650 --> 22:13.050]  Boy, we're getting hammered pretty hard.
[22:13.050 --> 22:17.550]  And also, it turns out nobody agreed with us.
[22:18.010 --> 22:19.290]  Everybody's on Gavin's side.
[22:19.530 --> 22:22.370]  Almost everybody is on Gavin's side.
[22:22.590 --> 22:25.650]  Someone came up with their own grid just from my description.
[22:25.890 --> 22:28.890]  And it's pretty much the exact same as mine, except vertical.
[22:29.110 --> 22:29.810]  And it looks nicer.
[22:30.290 --> 22:31.850]  Eric, you must be livid.
[22:32.090 --> 22:33.450]  Yeah, Gavin, gotta say I'm not thrilled.
[22:37.490 --> 22:42.450]  I mean, it's really shocking when you're right, you know you're right.
[22:42.450 --> 22:50.250]  And then you have to like really put into perspective how many people can be wrong in the world at one time.
[22:51.130 --> 22:52.690]  It's really kind of sad.
[22:52.830 --> 22:54.090]  I feel sad for them.
[22:55.150 --> 22:57.390]  Embarrassed for them that they would be this wrong.
[22:58.390 --> 23:04.990]  I think that's really kind of what it boils down to is, you know, you got to get out there and do your best every day.
[23:05.350 --> 23:07.030]  You know, it's a team effort.
[23:07.430 --> 23:11.690]  And, you know, it's not an individual thing.
[23:11.690 --> 23:14.610]  It's just, you know, you can't let the chatter get to you.
[23:14.730 --> 23:18.510]  You have to go out and just play the game the best that you can and do what you can every time.
[23:18.790 --> 23:23.770]  But have you thought about maybe just opening the mind, maybe seeing what all the fuss is about?
[23:24.170 --> 23:33.070]  Yeah, again, Gavin, it's like I said, it's you got to get out there and you can't let the naysayers and detractors get at you.
[23:33.250 --> 23:40.770]  You know, you got to go out there and do what you know is best and do what you believe in your heart and just play the game you know how.
[23:41.190 --> 23:42.910]  That's I think that's the important part.
[23:42.990 --> 23:47.950]  I, by the way, last week you were saying how, because we obviously threw this in the merch chat for discussion.
[23:48.110 --> 23:51.930]  And you were saying that the only person who agreed with me in there was Maxie.
[23:52.210 --> 23:52.470]  Right.
[23:52.890 --> 23:54.830]  That actually wasn't the case.
[23:55.030 --> 24:01.990]  Right. It's pretty sad to see, you know, again, I got to go out and say it's pretty sad to see how many people are wrong, how many people you've respected in your life.
[24:02.050 --> 24:07.310]  And again, there's a lot of chatter and there's a lot of people saying a lot of things, but it's not up to them.
[24:07.310 --> 24:11.670]  You know, it's it's just frankly, it's tough.
[24:11.810 --> 24:17.950]  It's tough when you think that everyone's got your best interests at heart and they don't and they're wrong the whole time.
[24:18.070 --> 24:19.610]  So it's pretty rough.
[24:19.730 --> 24:25.110]  Sometimes sometimes it happens with your own family, like when your wife says, so what's this extra medium thing?
[24:25.190 --> 24:26.950]  And then you explain it and she goes, no.
[24:28.790 --> 24:31.750]  And now you're betrayed, you know, just on like a marital level.
[24:31.950 --> 24:34.470]  So it's it's difficult.
[24:34.470 --> 24:40.650]  What we skipped by in the merch chat last week was we we said that Maxie agreed with me, of course.
[24:40.790 --> 24:48.950]  But also Tony wrote extra medium, I guess, would be mathematically exactly the measurement between small and large.
[24:49.330 --> 24:53.290]  Right. Yeah. And he and he'd be wrong about that, which is really like the tough part of the whole thing.
[24:54.090 --> 24:57.090]  Is that, you know, because we like to leave it up to.
[24:57.210 --> 24:58.790]  Yeah, that's the thing. We like Tony.
[24:59.190 --> 25:06.650]  And and it's really hard just to see him be that wrong the whole time, especially from a merch standpoint.
[25:06.890 --> 25:10.210]  You know what I mean? Like this is the guy we're trusting with the face with the face brand.
[25:10.510 --> 25:13.190]  Yeah. You know what? You know, it's great about this conversation.
[25:13.430 --> 25:15.130]  We've had it four times now.
[25:16.450 --> 25:22.390]  It's it gives me a unique perspective of this is what it must have been like to listen to me say.
[25:22.390 --> 25:30.330]  I never said I would eat a pencil is what just happened to watch somebody just be so clearly wrong and everybody being against it.
[25:30.390 --> 25:34.830]  But an unwillingness to move in the slightest. This has been a great exercise for me.
[25:35.330 --> 25:39.310]  What a what a crazy time that was in your defense, Eric.
[25:39.430 --> 25:43.410]  Can I say in commiseration? And I've said this before and I'll say it again.
[25:43.490 --> 25:48.870]  I feel dirty. I don't I don't like I don't like what's happened. I don't like that.
[25:48.870 --> 25:54.050]  My opinion has changed. I feel like there's something wrong in me that makes me agree with Gavin.
[25:54.290 --> 25:57.670]  And I don't I don't respect Gavin or his opinion.
[25:57.930 --> 26:05.790]  So it's really it's like it's it sucks, dude. It's like there's an like I'm not doing good internally.
[26:06.090 --> 26:11.130]  Yeah. So trying to get over this. I get what you're saying that it's like on a personal level.
[26:11.430 --> 26:18.410]  You know, now just imagine that's just like a million fold where you just have to see that in everyone else.
[26:18.410 --> 26:22.030]  And just and you're embarrassed, frankly, for all of those people.
[26:22.030 --> 26:27.010]  And it's it's really sad for them to live in a world where that's what they think extra medium is.
[26:27.190 --> 26:30.670]  Nick said this is Eric's pencil, but he doesn't have to eat his shirt.
[26:30.710 --> 26:35.070]  It's true. I never committed to eating anything. And I think that's probably what's going to let me off here.
[26:35.430 --> 26:40.790]  It sounds as though if I'd have asked anyone else at the company for an extra medium, I would have been given a medium.
[26:40.790 --> 26:44.050]  So I'm really unlocked out with who I ask.
[26:45.630 --> 26:51.650]  And I think that's the solace that I have in all of this is that people go, right. But it's Gavin. Why did he ask that way?
[26:51.750 --> 26:55.990]  And I'm like, right. No, I understand. Oh, man.
[26:56.810 --> 27:00.090]  Speaking of does it do I guess it's come out at this point. I hope. Yes, it is.
[27:00.090 --> 27:10.950]  We'll have the the premiere will have been I mean, at this point of this recording, it's tomorrow, but it'll the first two episodes will be out by the time this episode is out.
[27:11.270 --> 27:18.030]  So we'll take a break and then record some more. We had a great meeting to come up with, like the rest of the season, like a great meeting about that.
[27:18.110 --> 27:27.210]  So I'm excited to do more. Does it do? Yeah, it was. It felt like maybe a preview of of what office day is going to be like tomorrow, because tomorrow's our first office day as well.
[27:27.210 --> 27:33.150]  And it was me, Eric and Andrew. Gavin didn't show for some reason, but we went through.
[27:33.730 --> 27:37.310]  It was on your calendar, I assume. When was that, Tuesday? We did the meeting.
[27:37.550 --> 27:42.470]  It's Tuesday from one to two. It was on his calendar. Yeah, we talked about it in the last recording.
[27:42.910 --> 27:48.770]  We scheduled it and everything. You were there. But it was like it was like one of the most fruitful meetings we've ever had.
[27:48.830 --> 27:54.430]  We went through all the products for the rest of the season and we came up with all the props and all the tests and everything.
[27:54.430 --> 28:00.310]  And I'm I'm I was excited about does it do before just with the idea of when I came up with it.
[28:00.510 --> 28:05.890]  And then I was really excited after we filmed the first two episodes, more so episode two than one, except that two is stronger.
[28:06.030 --> 28:13.510]  But I'm way more excited now because the stuff that like that we were coming up with together was so much better.
[28:13.630 --> 28:16.730]  It's so funny. I'm really excited to get back in there and film again.
[28:16.730 --> 28:23.890]  So that meeting has haunted me in an unexpected way, Geoff. Yeah, I talked to Gavin that evening.
[28:23.970 --> 28:28.350]  OK, and I talked to him about the meeting and I said we had a meeting today.
[28:28.410 --> 28:32.610]  We're talking about things for the show. How it do what? And then he corrected me.
[28:32.750 --> 28:36.150]  And I was so embarrassed. And I'm still living in that embarrassment.
[28:36.490 --> 28:42.270]  I haven't stopped thinking about the fact that I said how it do as the show named it.
[28:42.270 --> 28:46.130]  That's the question you ask after does it do comes up. Yeah, yeah.
[28:47.110 --> 28:54.310]  Oh, it was so bad. I feel so bad about it. What was going on with your brain there?
[28:54.430 --> 28:59.390]  I don't know. Maybe I think there's a graphic in the first one or how it works.
[28:59.490 --> 29:03.210]  I don't know. It was just my brain was somewhere else. Yeah, I don't know.
[29:03.670 --> 29:09.890]  I don't know where it was, but it was bad. It was an embarrassing moment that I haven't been able to stop thinking about how it do.
[29:13.530 --> 29:17.030]  Well, I haven't thought about it since 10 seconds after you said it, but I'm glad it's been over.
[29:17.450 --> 29:23.350]  Yeah, it's I knew I know it's one of those. Literally, it's all I've been thinking about for two days constantly.
[29:24.270 --> 29:30.310]  How it do what an idiot. So tomorrow is our is our office day. First office day.
[29:30.350 --> 29:34.250]  Is everybody gonna show up or is everybody gonna be there? What time is that?
[29:34.530 --> 29:38.810]  I mean, right now we were gonna hit baseballs from 10 to 12, but now we're not.
[29:38.810 --> 29:43.370]  So we can just move it and go noon to four or we can do 11 to four.
[29:43.610 --> 29:47.730]  I mean, we have we have like some space to play, but I'm free for it's my whole day.
[29:47.790 --> 29:52.870]  I have my whole day marked off for when I was like, is everybody gonna I was more.
[29:53.210 --> 29:58.450]  It was very pointedly focused at Gavin. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I'm free after 11.
[29:59.130 --> 30:04.310]  OK, awesome. That's very exciting. All right. I will. I will make an adjustment to the calendar invite. Fantastic.
[30:04.830 --> 30:08.030]  I'm excited. I don't know what's what that's going to bring, but I'm excited for it.
[30:08.030 --> 30:11.890]  Did you guys see this image on Instagram the other day, Emily? No.
[30:12.230 --> 30:16.210]  I sent it in the slack. It's somebody naked person in the background.
[30:16.550 --> 30:22.010]  I mean, I think it's somebody who's probably wearing shorts, but it's somebody sent it to the face Instagram.
[30:22.230 --> 30:29.470]  And it's somebody named Elizabeth. And it appears that they got a go go now tattoo on their finger.
[30:30.290 --> 30:41.010]  That's awesome. We were so excited about Emily, me, Tamara and go go now, Joey are all going to go get that tattoo.
[30:41.090 --> 30:44.730]  We're all going to go get that tattoo on our fingers together to commemorate the event.
[30:44.890 --> 30:47.870]  We're pretty excited. Are you going to do it on the same finger? Yeah, I think so. I got room.
[30:47.870 --> 30:50.610]  You think so? I don't know. I feel like it should be on the on the index.
[30:50.790 --> 30:53.910]  I was going to say, yeah, like a pointer finger. Yeah, it's like it should be the finger.
[30:55.110 --> 30:59.570]  Yeah, like go go now. Go here. Pointing. Oh yeah, I can do that. That's a good point.
[30:59.790 --> 31:03.110]  I well, maybe they were looking to hide it a little bit more, but that's fair.
[31:03.410 --> 31:08.030]  I'm I'm all about. I mean, there's no hiding my tattoos. So yeah, I'll get it on my index finger for sure.
[31:08.150 --> 31:11.550]  That's a great point. Is that the middle finger that they did it on? I think so.
[31:11.570 --> 31:14.170]  Because I respect that too, I guess. Like go go now. Fuck yourself.
[31:17.250 --> 31:20.830]  Yeah, exactly. I really like it on the middle finger. Maybe keep it in the middle. Good point.
[31:21.050 --> 31:23.190]  I think no matter what finger you put it on, it works.
[31:23.190 --> 31:28.830]  It's a great, it's a fantastic tattoo. Anyway, so I just wanted to shout out to Elizabeth for getting that tattoo.
[31:29.150 --> 31:36.890]  And just so you know, we're all going to rip off your tattoo and get it ourselves to the crew that was on the boat that survived.
[31:42.780 --> 31:49.200]  One of my favorite things to do when I'm playing a game or just even browsing stuff online is to have a podcast or music going.
[31:49.520 --> 31:52.340]  Recently, I've been listening to a lot of 90s Canadian music. It's been great.
[31:52.340 --> 31:58.100]  One of the best parts of the experience has been using my Raycon wireless earbuds to do it.
[31:58.480 --> 32:03.900]  Raycon's everyday earbuds look, feel and sound better than ever with optimized gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit.
[32:04.320 --> 32:08.880]  These earbuds are so comfortable and they will not budge. Trust me.
[32:09.220 --> 32:14.360]  They also have incredible battery life. They give you eight hours of playtime and 32 hours of battery life.
[32:14.460 --> 32:19.640]  So I'm never worried about them dying. It's great in that respect. And Raycons are priced just right.
[32:19.640 --> 32:24.560]  You get quality audio at half the price of other premium audio brands.
[32:25.080 --> 32:30.000]  It's no wonder Raycon everyday earbuds have over 50,000 five-star reviews.
[32:30.120 --> 32:34.020]  Other things I love about these earbuds, there are three customizable sound profiles.
[32:34.220 --> 32:36.840]  You have pure sound, which is perfect for podcasting.
[32:37.200 --> 32:41.140]  Balanced sound, which is great for classical jazz, blues, rock, pop, folk.
[32:41.560 --> 32:46.460]  And bass sound, which is great for hip-hop, EDM, R&B, reggae. It's fantastic.
[32:46.460 --> 32:51.500]  So no matter what you're listening to, you will have the optimal experience with one of these sound profiles.
[32:51.920 --> 32:59.240]  Also, noise isolation is another fantastic feature of these. Being able to block everything else out and just focus in on what you're trying to listen to.
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.440]  It's awesome. Raycons are great. I use them on the go. I use them just relaxing at home.
[33:04.900 --> 33:08.320]  Doesn't matter what I'm listening to, music, podcast. It's fantastic.

[35:54.420 --> 35:56.560]  I had an interesting thing happen.
[35:56.960 --> 36:04.080]  I feel like I need to tell this story because there's a possibility that somebody could have this happen to them.
[36:04.560 --> 36:08.580]  It was a few days ago. Just a normal night.
[36:09.180 --> 36:10.460]  I got a call from my mom.
[36:10.940 --> 36:14.400]  She said, hi, there's something wrong with the TV.
[36:15.400 --> 36:17.060]  Can you come fix this?
[36:17.600 --> 36:18.940]  I was like, well, what's going on? What's wrong?
[36:18.940 --> 36:24.580]  If it's broken to the point where she's calling, I'm assuming I'm not going to be able to fix it.
[36:24.820 --> 36:29.300]  She's not tech savvy, but it's an extreme call.
[36:29.860 --> 36:33.460]  She's like, I don't want to talk about this over the phone. You have to come over here. You have to fix this.
[36:33.840 --> 36:34.940]  I said, okay.
[36:36.140 --> 36:37.360]  I went to her place.
[36:38.240 --> 36:38.940]  I look at the TV.
[36:39.660 --> 36:47.420]  As soon as I look at the TV, I'm greeted with an image of the Vancouver Child Kicker skateboard in my closet.
[36:47.420 --> 36:49.580]  I'm thinking, what?
[36:50.260 --> 36:51.460]  What is going on?
[36:51.680 --> 36:52.700]  How did this happen?
[36:53.340 --> 36:55.600]  I was expecting it to just be a pixel issue.
[36:55.900 --> 36:59.080]  Why is a photo I took on this television?
[36:59.580 --> 37:02.640]  I said, what were you doing on the TV?
[37:02.860 --> 37:04.860]  She said, I was watching Disney Plus.
[37:05.500 --> 37:06.120]  I said, okay.
[37:06.900 --> 37:07.380]  You're on.
[37:07.840 --> 37:09.760]  Then I put all the pieces together.
[37:09.900 --> 37:15.120]  What happened was, for Christmas, I bought her an Amazon Fire Stick because she wasn't able to watch Disney Plus.
[37:15.120 --> 37:16.800]  She wanted to watch only murders in the building.
[37:17.060 --> 37:19.060]  She watches Disney Plus through the Fire Stick.
[37:19.380 --> 37:27.140]  I got an email maybe two or three months ago from Amazon saying, hey, we have Amazon Photos.
[37:27.320 --> 37:31.180]  If you use our app, we'll give you a $15 gift card.
[37:31.640 --> 37:32.500]  I signed up for that.
[37:32.980 --> 37:40.480]  When I signed up, it immediately just transferred all of my camera roll onto their service.
[37:41.040 --> 37:41.580]  Oh, no.
[37:42.300 --> 37:43.300]  Then I'm piecing together.
[37:43.300 --> 37:47.420]  It must be the Amazon Photo thing.
[37:47.520 --> 37:48.600]  I said, how did this happen?
[37:48.940 --> 37:53.880]  She said, well, I got up to use the bathroom, and I came back, and all these photos were on the screen.
[37:54.540 --> 37:59.420]  The first photo that appeared when she came back was a photo of my driver's license.
[37:59.940 --> 38:04.760]  I guess I took a photo to sign up for a medical app or a COVID thing in the past.
[38:04.860 --> 38:07.940]  I had to send in a government ID to register for it.
[38:08.580 --> 38:11.480]  She thought that her TV was hacked by Anonymous.
[38:11.480 --> 38:13.920]  She thought that this was a deep...
[38:13.920 --> 38:15.760]  That's why she didn't want to tell me over the phone.
[38:15.840 --> 38:17.500]  She thought it was like an enemy of the state.
[38:17.940 --> 38:19.420]  Like somebody had hacked...
[38:19.420 --> 38:23.220]  Yeah, she was convinced because it was like all these personal photos.
[38:23.660 --> 38:29.040]  And I have never been more relieved that my camera roll was filled with just things that make me laugh.
[38:29.100 --> 38:33.780]  Because I could just see in my head for certain people how disastrous this could have been.
[38:35.260 --> 38:38.380]  So I sorted it out. I turned off the screensaver mode for it.
[38:38.480 --> 38:41.440]  Went into Amazon Photos, got rid of my camera roll, deleted everything.
[38:41.860 --> 38:45.080]  But just a warning to people, if you have Amazon Photos,
[38:45.300 --> 38:51.000]  and there's somebody in your life that is using your Amazon account through a stick or whatever,
[38:51.700 --> 38:53.240]  just be aware. Just be cautious.
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.180]  Because that could be such a bad scenario for people.
[38:56.180 --> 38:58.100]  That could have been catastrophic for you.
[38:58.160 --> 38:59.860]  It could have been disastrous.
[38:59.860 --> 39:06.200]  We have one of those little Amazon Alexa TV things in the kitchen.
[39:07.200 --> 39:10.460]  And we set that up so that we could put...
[39:10.460 --> 39:13.240]  Emily wanted to put photos of the dogs and stuff.
[39:13.280 --> 39:13.860]  Well, dog now.
[39:14.200 --> 39:15.180]  And stuff in there.
[39:15.760 --> 39:18.580]  And when she left, after the first day she set it up,
[39:18.740 --> 39:23.480]  I just filled it with pictures of her sleeping with her mouth open that I've taken from trips and stuff.
[39:24.820 --> 39:26.220]  So then she did the same.
[39:26.640 --> 39:28.060]  So now if you ever come to my house,
[39:28.060 --> 39:31.220]  just look at the screensaver on the Amazon,
[39:31.600 --> 39:33.560]  because it's just us fucking with each other,
[39:34.140 --> 39:36.360]  trying to one-up each other with more embarrassing photos.
[39:36.820 --> 39:38.200]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[39:39.620 --> 39:40.280]  That's great.
[39:40.520 --> 39:42.740]  Well, I'm glad Gene Hackman's not trying to hack your mom.
[39:43.640 --> 39:44.840]  Is that a good movie?
[39:45.260 --> 39:45.920]  Enemy of the State?
[39:46.360 --> 39:47.960]  I haven't seen it in such a long time.
[39:48.260 --> 39:50.540]  I mean, I haven't seen it since it came out, but I remember enjoying it.
[39:50.640 --> 39:53.640]  Were you having to quickly think of all the stuff in your camera roll?
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.520]  Like, the moment you saw that on there, were you just in a panic?
[39:56.780 --> 39:57.620]  Like, how fucked am I?
[39:57.620 --> 40:01.820]  No, like, I kind of, as I said, I know what my camera roll is.
[40:02.280 --> 40:05.020]  It's just, it's 99% things that made me laugh.
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.060]  And then, like, the occasional picture of, like, fuckface merch,
[40:09.220 --> 40:10.860]  that they're, like, sent to a family member or something.
[40:10.980 --> 40:12.700]  Being like, look at this. This is cool.
[40:12.980 --> 40:14.560]  Like, a Boyz Zimmer type thing.
[40:14.660 --> 40:15.020]  Yeah.
[40:15.580 --> 40:16.980]  Yeah, no, I was more relieved.
[40:17.060 --> 40:18.920]  It wasn't me processing what was there.
[40:19.080 --> 40:24.180]  It was the relief of knowing that there was nothing I would be embarrassed about on that camera roll.
[40:25.540 --> 40:27.240]  It was a huge sense of relief.
[40:27.240 --> 40:29.680]  It was like winning a thing that you didn't know you entered.
[40:29.800 --> 40:30.600]  It was great.
[40:33.120 --> 40:34.700]  I just felt it was important to share.
[40:35.060 --> 40:37.080]  Because I could, there's so many versions.
[40:37.260 --> 40:41.960]  In a weird way, it was almost disappointment that it wasn't more embarrassing what was on the screen.
[40:42.160 --> 40:43.740]  Because it would be a funnier story.
[40:43.960 --> 40:46.200]  Mine would have had a bunch of pictures of my ass.
[40:46.860 --> 40:47.260]  Bruise.
[40:47.480 --> 40:49.480]  As I've been tracking it slowly change shape.
[40:51.260 --> 40:52.340]  What's the current shape?
[40:52.580 --> 40:53.300]  It's pretty much gone.
[40:53.540 --> 40:53.840]  Okay.
[40:54.080 --> 40:56.260]  Well, don't worry, buddy. We're filming Does It Do Again pretty soon.
[40:56.260 --> 40:58.280]  Can I do it from like, can I sit down?
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.540]  You can not flop all over the goddamn place if you want.
[41:03.840 --> 41:04.080]  Yeah.
[41:06.020 --> 41:10.740]  Every one of those spills you took was 100% self-imposed.
[41:11.140 --> 41:11.280]  Yep.
[41:11.620 --> 41:12.340]  Oh, 100%.
[41:12.840 --> 41:13.280]  Real dumb.
[41:13.500 --> 41:13.980]  And impressive.
[41:14.660 --> 41:16.420]  That one where you kicked the TV?
[41:16.780 --> 41:17.440]  That was very good.
[41:18.100 --> 41:20.480]  I don't even think the bad one was in episode one.
[41:20.560 --> 41:21.720]  I think the bad one's in episode two.
[41:21.940 --> 41:22.940]  Yeah, it was in episode two.
[41:23.200 --> 41:24.000]  It was during the race.
[41:24.940 --> 41:31.660]  When I heard you hit, I was so convinced I was going to turn around and see your wrist snapped in half.
[41:32.080 --> 41:33.220]  Oh, God, man.
[41:33.600 --> 41:34.020]  I've been thinking...
[41:34.640 --> 41:37.460]  It hurt so much more after than it did at the time as well.
[41:37.600 --> 41:39.960]  Like, it kind of hurt at the time because I was like...
[41:39.960 --> 41:40.660]  But the pain went away.
[41:40.740 --> 41:43.060]  And then just later that night, I was just like...
[41:44.560 --> 41:50.320]  I've been thinking about getting into downhill mountain biking.
[41:51.260 --> 41:51.620]  What?
[41:51.840 --> 41:52.120]  No.
[41:52.500 --> 41:52.840]  Yeah.
[41:52.840 --> 41:54.760]  Yeah, I've been thinking about it pretty seriously.
[41:55.780 --> 41:56.500]  Absolutely not.
[41:56.780 --> 41:58.080]  That sounds like a terrible idea.
[41:58.180 --> 42:02.040]  My therapist does downhill mountain biking, and I've been thinking about it for a long time.
[42:02.320 --> 42:04.920]  And I got really kind of keyed up on it.
[42:05.220 --> 42:07.460]  The idea last week to the point where I was even looking at bikes.
[42:07.840 --> 42:12.660]  And there's a place called Spider Mountain up northwest of here that I thought I could go try that has like a ski lift and stuff.
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.320]  And I was figuring, like, I'm not trying to hit like 20 foot jumps or anything, but I could hit some like six, seven foot jumps.
[42:18.320 --> 42:24.600]  You know, in my older age, I can take like the blue line down, not the black diamond or whatever.
[42:24.740 --> 42:25.880]  I figured I could probably handle that.
[42:26.340 --> 42:28.040]  Clearly, not today.
[42:28.640 --> 42:30.500]  I need to recover a little bit first.
[42:30.920 --> 42:31.580]  But I was...
[42:31.580 --> 42:32.520]  I finally...
[42:32.520 --> 42:33.320]  I've been kind of hiding it.
[42:33.500 --> 42:41.360]  But I decided to admit it to Emily that I was seriously thinking about doing this and looking to get into that.
[42:41.960 --> 42:43.640]  And she was like...
[42:43.640 --> 42:44.600]  I'm gonna show you a photo.
[42:44.600 --> 42:45.960]  She was like...
[42:45.960 --> 42:50.700]  Just yesterday, I was cutting one of my client's hair, and he showed me his arm.
[42:50.800 --> 42:53.180]  And on his arm were five giant scars.
[42:53.680 --> 42:55.040]  Like, giant scars.
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.400]  And I asked, like, what in the hell happened?
[42:57.800 --> 42:58.700]  His, uh...
[42:58.700 --> 42:59.440]  His, like...
[42:59.440 --> 43:00.280]  He went on vacation.
[43:00.720 --> 43:02.040]  And he went up to, like, I don't know.
[43:02.320 --> 43:03.340]  Somewhere where they have mountain biking.
[43:03.480 --> 43:04.420]  Zion or...
[43:04.420 --> 43:04.940]  Somewhere.
[43:05.500 --> 43:08.900]  And, uh, decided by himself he was gonna, like, get into mountain biking.
[43:09.120 --> 43:09.880]  Same thing as me.
[43:10.020 --> 43:11.780]  Like, dude, probably in his 40s or something.
[43:11.780 --> 43:14.360]  Uh, just saw some TikToks, thought it looked cool.
[43:15.020 --> 43:17.220]  And, uh, was like, wife is out of town or something.
[43:17.300 --> 43:19.060]  So he just said, like, I'm gonna have a trip by myself.
[43:19.140 --> 43:20.240]  I'm gonna go up and do something I wanna do.
[43:20.760 --> 43:24.800]  And, uh, she showed me a photo of him above the hill, smiling and waving at the selfie.
[43:25.260 --> 43:30.260]  And then she showed me a picture of an arm that I shit you not looked like an accordion.
[43:31.000 --> 43:31.920]  Oh, God.
[43:32.780 --> 43:34.380]  His arm was in...
[43:34.380 --> 43:35.280]  It went, like...
[43:35.280 --> 43:36.480]  It went, like...
[43:37.040 --> 43:40.180]  It went, like, from the elbow up, like, maybe three inches.
[43:40.300 --> 43:41.100]  And then to the right.
[43:41.100 --> 43:42.440]  And then far to the left.
[43:42.620 --> 43:43.280]  And then to the right.
[43:43.400 --> 43:44.440]  And then back to the left again.
[43:44.500 --> 43:45.300]  And then there was a wrist.
[43:45.760 --> 43:48.000]  The dude broke his arm in so many different places.
[43:48.180 --> 43:49.240]  It was like a...
[43:49.240 --> 43:51.100]  It was like...
[43:51.100 --> 43:54.720]  They were doing, like, experimental surgery to fix it because nobody had ever fucked their arm up that bad.
[43:54.840 --> 43:55.900]  And he was by himself.
[43:55.900 --> 43:56.320]  Oh, my God.
[43:56.420 --> 43:57.140]  And he, uh...
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.420]  He had to drive, like, I don't know, 20 miles.
[43:59.520 --> 44:02.060]  A car with an accordion arm to get to a hospital.
[44:02.520 --> 44:03.400]  And so...
[44:03.400 --> 44:05.020]  That's slowing me down a little bit.
[44:05.220 --> 44:06.140]  But, uh...
[44:06.540 --> 44:06.860]  Yeah.
[44:07.140 --> 44:07.820]  I don't...
[44:07.820 --> 44:08.920]  Yeah, can we vote on this now?
[44:09.240 --> 44:11.080]  Yeah, I mean, it's a unanimous no.
[44:11.080 --> 44:12.200]  You shouldn't do this.
[44:12.520 --> 44:19.540]  I don't get how you have a session and your entire point of session is that everything in your body is broken.
[44:20.300 --> 44:23.740]  And the walk-away point is maybe I should get into downhill mountain biking.
[44:24.140 --> 44:24.280]  Yeah.
[44:24.300 --> 44:25.700]  I don't understand how that gets suggested.
[44:26.080 --> 44:27.800]  Uh, well, it didn't get suggested.
[44:27.900 --> 44:28.680]  I suggested it.
[44:28.760 --> 44:29.400]  I see.
[44:29.760 --> 44:30.920]  And they're like, I do this as well.
[44:30.920 --> 44:31.280]  Yeah, it's my idea.
[44:31.520 --> 44:34.660]  Yeah, I've known for a while my therapist mountain bikes.
[44:34.960 --> 44:36.180]  It's something we talk about sometimes.
[44:36.300 --> 44:37.140]  We both love bicycles.
[44:37.340 --> 44:40.960]  So it's, like, a common point of conversation on occasion.
[44:40.960 --> 44:42.280]  I still think...
[44:42.280 --> 44:42.840]  I'm still...
[44:42.840 --> 44:43.860]  That definitely slowed me down.
[44:43.960 --> 44:48.140]  That and my knee and my ankle have definitely slowed...
[44:48.140 --> 44:49.840]  No, I don't want to mountain bike with my therapist.
[44:49.940 --> 44:50.760]  I just want to mountain bike.
[44:52.160 --> 44:52.880]  But I...
[44:52.880 --> 44:53.280]  Yeah.
[44:53.860 --> 44:54.580]  I, uh...
[44:54.580 --> 44:55.760]  I'm still considering it.
[44:55.860 --> 44:56.160]  I don't know.
[44:56.600 --> 44:57.400]  Thanks for the feedback.
[44:58.240 --> 44:59.880]  I'll take it that you guys are on the fence.
[45:00.100 --> 45:02.480]  I want to throw some weight on this to slow you down further.
[45:02.840 --> 45:04.840]  So the accordion arm guy, right?
[45:04.920 --> 45:05.540]  He crashed.
[45:05.680 --> 45:06.240]  Had to drive.
[45:06.240 --> 45:10.820]  Now imagine, in that drive, you're going to be in 25 car accidents.
[45:11.060 --> 45:12.460]  From point A to point B.
[45:12.820 --> 45:14.900]  So you need to factor that into the paint.
[45:15.520 --> 45:16.300]  This is not...
[45:16.300 --> 45:17.500]  You're the least...
[45:17.500 --> 45:18.140]  You're the least...
[45:18.140 --> 45:19.520]  Not qualified isn't the right word.
[45:19.720 --> 45:23.560]  But you are the, like, the number one not candidate for doing this.
[45:23.740 --> 45:25.220]  You should be at the bottom of the list.
[45:25.380 --> 45:27.080]  That's how I'll get to the ambulance faster.
[45:29.680 --> 45:31.560]  Geoff, I want to side with you.
[45:31.680 --> 45:32.860]  I think you should give it a shot.
[45:33.360 --> 45:33.780]  Thanks, man.
[45:33.780 --> 45:34.320]  Yeah, man.
[45:34.400 --> 45:36.860]  So we are hitting baseballs tomorrow or not?
[45:37.200 --> 45:38.100]  No, I don't think so.
[45:38.100 --> 45:38.460]  Oh, okay.
[45:38.560 --> 45:39.780]  And that was because of...
[45:41.560 --> 45:42.780]  I'm still pretty...
[45:42.780 --> 45:43.480]  I'm still...
[45:43.480 --> 45:43.560]  Okay.
[45:44.020 --> 45:44.860]  I honestly...
[45:44.860 --> 45:46.140]  So it was a curb that...
[45:46.140 --> 45:46.420]  Okay.
[45:46.740 --> 45:47.700]  No, I still say yes.
[45:47.780 --> 45:48.480]  I'm still going to go yeah.
[45:48.740 --> 45:51.580]  Yeah, but there's not going to be any curbs on the mountain.
[45:51.780 --> 45:54.460]  You're going to be like Geoff Kent is what's going to happen.
[45:54.920 --> 45:59.140]  You're not going to be able to hit baseballs because you broke your wrist doing wheelies on a bike.
[46:00.920 --> 46:02.320]  This is a disaster.
[46:02.320 --> 46:04.860]  Your baseball career is being impacted by this.
[46:05.060 --> 46:07.400]  It would be a disaster if this ended my baseball career.
[46:07.540 --> 46:10.400]  But to be fair, we could end up with a new bike jump stunt out of this.
[46:10.720 --> 46:11.540]  I think we will.
[46:11.720 --> 46:12.040]  Would.
[46:12.200 --> 46:12.440]  Will.
[46:12.520 --> 46:12.900]  We'll see.
[46:13.500 --> 46:14.080]  I don't know.
[46:14.100 --> 46:17.400]  I'm not in a hurry to get back on my bike on the street right now.
[46:17.740 --> 46:20.840]  We could potentially watch an arm become an accordion in slow motion.
[46:21.080 --> 46:23.060]  I don't want to see that in slow motion.
[46:23.100 --> 46:23.580]  I don't either.
[46:23.860 --> 46:24.820]  Oh, man.
[46:28.320 --> 46:31.980]  My best friend in the army, when he was in high school, he was a big skateboarder.
[46:32.780 --> 46:33.440]  Oh, God.
[46:33.760 --> 46:34.580]  Oh, no.
[46:34.840 --> 46:40.340]  He was filming skateboard parts with his friends when he was like 16.
[46:41.380 --> 46:43.200]  And he like, I don't know what he did.
[46:43.260 --> 46:44.580]  I don't remember what the trick was.
[46:44.660 --> 46:46.880]  I think it was like a rail grind or something.
[46:46.940 --> 46:47.600]  It wasn't crazy.
[46:47.700 --> 46:48.760]  It wasn't even down steps or anything.
[46:48.800 --> 46:49.660]  It was on like a flat rail.
[46:50.280 --> 46:52.160]  But he slipped and landed wrong.
[46:52.380 --> 46:54.040]  And he snapped his arm in half.
[46:55.160 --> 46:58.900]  And from about, I would say about halfway up the forearm.
[46:59.420 --> 47:05.300]  And so it was like, and there's a video he showed me in the army of him screaming and holding his arm and running around in a circle, not knowing what to do.
[47:05.440 --> 47:08.140]  While his arm was just like flopping around in every different direction.
[47:08.780 --> 47:10.120]  Before, I guess, they stopped filming.
[47:10.540 --> 47:11.320]  Oh, that's terrible.
[47:11.940 --> 47:12.300]  Yeah.
[47:13.000 --> 47:13.680]  That was pretty gross.
[47:15.140 --> 47:17.800]  That was an MTV show when I was growing up.
[47:17.900 --> 47:20.140]  Was it Scarred? MTV Scars?
[47:20.760 --> 47:21.780]  That's a sick show.
[47:21.780 --> 47:25.840]  It was just, yeah, the only thing I remember, I was always too scared to watch it.
[47:26.100 --> 47:28.340]  But I remember watching it a little bit.
[47:28.740 --> 47:31.420]  I remember there was one where a guy was like grinding down a rail.
[47:31.900 --> 47:36.520]  And then he fell and the rail had like a sliced lip at like the edge of it.
[47:36.860 --> 47:40.100]  And he like cut his ball sack open on impact.
[47:40.360 --> 47:41.400]  Like it was bad.
[47:41.800 --> 47:42.460]  It's a bad show.
[47:43.040 --> 47:46.500]  That's a show that's hard to believe that was just on TV like middle of the day.
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.920]  How could that be televised?
[47:48.260 --> 47:49.040]  I don't know.
[47:49.200 --> 47:50.580]  I never, I was too scared to watch it.
[47:50.580 --> 47:52.020]  Maybe it wasn't as graphic.
[47:52.160 --> 47:55.720]  Maybe it was like all they would like lead in and like explain it but not show anything.
[47:55.960 --> 47:59.260]  But it was just not, it was not what I was interested in.
[47:59.580 --> 48:00.040]  It's terrible.
[48:00.400 --> 48:01.160]  There's a line.
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.620]  It's where physical comedy becomes not funny at all.
[48:04.960 --> 48:07.600]  I feel like Wipeout is sort of the sweet spot.
[48:07.720 --> 48:10.260]  Or Jackass is maybe even better.
[48:10.600 --> 48:11.040]  I don't know.
[48:11.260 --> 48:12.720]  As soon as it's permanent.
[48:12.940 --> 48:15.360]  As soon as you watch something permanent happen, it's not funny to me.
[48:15.740 --> 48:16.100]  Yeah.
[48:16.620 --> 48:17.200]  That's so weird.
[48:17.320 --> 48:19.720]  Maybe it shows how poor my priorities are.
[48:19.720 --> 48:23.060]  If I'm okay, I try to laugh immediately on impact.
[48:23.200 --> 48:24.580]  Mainly for everybody else.
[48:25.700 --> 48:28.660]  Like when I fell out of that chair, heart immediate laughter.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.020]  Just because it's loud.
[48:31.460 --> 48:32.860]  I need everyone to know it's okay.
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.440]  I was telling Eric all this shit earlier in the week.
[48:36.520 --> 48:38.480]  We were recording one of the other podcasts.
[48:38.820 --> 48:40.260]  And the Austin one.
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.480]  And he told me, he was like, well, I guess you're going to get a root canal next week.
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.480]  And let me tell you, if I don't show up for the recording next week.
[48:48.720 --> 48:50.380]  It's because...
[48:50.380 --> 48:52.660]  This is the only way I won't show up for the recording next week.
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.240]  It's because it will be if I wake up Monday or Tuesday morning with a toothache.
[48:57.340 --> 48:59.520]  And I find out I do need a root canal.
[48:59.900 --> 49:00.740]  I'm going off the grid.
[49:00.900 --> 49:02.200]  And nobody will ever see me again.
[49:02.340 --> 49:03.700]  I'm just walking away from this life.
[49:04.000 --> 49:04.840]  I'm just going to walk away.
[49:04.840 --> 49:07.700]  I'm going to be like Bill Bixby.
[49:07.880 --> 49:09.620]  At the end of an episode of Incredible Hulk.
[49:09.740 --> 49:10.900]  I'm just going to walk away.
[49:11.260 --> 49:12.660]  Or like, what's his face?
[49:12.700 --> 49:13.960]  Carradine in Kung Fu.
[49:13.960 --> 49:15.540]  You'll never see me again.
[49:15.660 --> 49:16.120]  That's it.
[49:16.220 --> 49:17.980]  That's my exit from this life.
[49:18.080 --> 49:19.000]  I just, I will quit.
[49:19.100 --> 49:20.260]  I will throw up on my hands and quit.
[49:20.480 --> 49:22.320]  You have an appointment next week for that?
[49:22.500 --> 49:23.020]  For a root canal?
[49:23.300 --> 49:24.940]  No, I'm just saying, are you going to the dentist?
[49:25.120 --> 49:25.900]  No, I got nothing.
[49:26.020 --> 49:26.420]  I got nothing.
[49:26.820 --> 49:27.660]  But it's like...
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.600]  Completely out of left field.
[49:28.740 --> 49:29.160]  Yeah, no.
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.300]  It's just like, if this trend continues.
[49:31.440 --> 49:32.640]  A house problem.
[49:33.020 --> 49:34.480]  Geoff falls off his bike.
[49:34.820 --> 49:36.940]  Fucking rash issues.
[49:37.440 --> 49:38.640]  Like, if it...
[49:38.640 --> 49:39.560]  Car accident.
[49:39.840 --> 49:42.280]  Like, it's either a fridge or a root canal.
[49:42.280 --> 49:44.160]  And if one of the...
[49:44.160 --> 49:45.120]  Fridge, I can live with.
[49:45.200 --> 49:46.540]  If root canal happens next week, that's it.
[49:46.600 --> 49:46.800]  I'm done.
[49:46.940 --> 49:47.220]  I'm done.
[49:47.680 --> 49:48.800]  That's a wrap on Geoff.
[49:49.800 --> 49:50.640]  Yeah, you're living...
[49:50.640 --> 49:52.580]  You're living several of my nightmares.
[49:53.080 --> 49:54.120]  I don't know if you ever watched...
[49:54.120 --> 49:55.260]  Did you see The Night Of?
[49:55.580 --> 49:56.420]  It was an HBO miniseries.
[49:57.500 --> 49:58.980]  Oh, about the cab driver?
[49:59.280 --> 49:59.580]  Yeah.
[49:59.720 --> 50:00.740]  I watched the first episode.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.380]  John Turturro is in that, and he plays a lawyer.
[50:03.760 --> 50:06.800]  And it's like an eight episode arc, and it's about this murder and trying to figure out
[50:06.800 --> 50:07.300]  what happened.
[50:07.740 --> 50:12.200]  But there's a subplot through the entire series of he just has a rash that will not
[50:12.200 --> 50:12.700]  go away.
[50:13.100 --> 50:15.400]  And it gets progressively worse with stress.
[50:16.040 --> 50:17.920]  And it's just this commentary.
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.700]  I don't know how accurate it is, but it seemed like dealing with rashes just is the worst
[50:22.700 --> 50:23.120]  thing ever.
[50:23.600 --> 50:24.480]  No creams worked.
[50:24.820 --> 50:25.720]  None of the pills worked.
[50:25.920 --> 50:31.860]  Just him bouncing from doctor to doctor, not getting any resolution, having to go to weird
[50:32.900 --> 50:36.280]  street vendors to find unorthodox methods of healing.
[50:36.440 --> 50:40.140]  You're living my fear of having one of these rashes that just will not go away.
[50:40.420 --> 50:40.840]  Yeah.
[50:40.840 --> 50:41.340]  Yeah.
[50:41.360 --> 50:42.240]  It's fascinating.
[50:42.560 --> 50:44.360]  It's been fascinating to observe this.
[50:44.980 --> 50:51.340]  Andrew and I played Halo the other night for the first time in a few months, and he said
[50:51.340 --> 50:52.740]  something kind of insane to me.
[50:52.900 --> 50:53.780]  Was this in Halo?
[50:53.860 --> 50:55.660]  Was this like post podcast?
[50:56.020 --> 51:00.800]  I said that you hit like you said you'd hit like three hundred and twenty thousand gamer
[51:00.800 --> 51:01.480]  score or something.
[51:01.840 --> 51:02.320]  Oh, my God.
[51:02.340 --> 51:07.660]  Oh, are you talking about what we this was a different what we said after the podcast
[51:08.180 --> 51:08.580]  Yeah.
[51:09.900 --> 51:16.240]  And he was just like, I bet by the end of the year I could get it in my head.
[51:16.300 --> 51:16.980]  I'm just filling in.
[51:17.060 --> 51:20.860]  I'm like, oh, he thinks he can get four hundred thousand by the end of the year.
[51:21.640 --> 51:25.140]  The guy says, I bet by the end of the year I could hit a million.
[51:25.640 --> 51:26.040]  What?
[51:26.220 --> 51:32.260]  So the conversation was, I'm glad that there's a time difference between us because there
[51:32.260 --> 51:33.980]  are times where I have burger confidence.
[51:33.980 --> 51:37.460]  Burger confidence will often hit at around ten thirty p.m.
[51:37.680 --> 51:40.300]  for you guys, which is not I don't feel comfortable.
[51:40.300 --> 51:41.260]  I don't want to disturb you.
[51:41.320 --> 51:42.320]  I'm not going to text that time.
[51:42.520 --> 51:46.680]  I had this thought where it's like, I should maybe I bet I could hit a million points.
[51:46.800 --> 51:50.000]  I should make a bet with Gavin that I could hit a million gamer score.
[51:50.060 --> 51:52.320]  I'm at like three hundred twenty thousand right now.
[51:52.960 --> 51:54.040]  I bet you I could do this.
[51:54.460 --> 51:55.720]  And then some time passed.
[51:55.800 --> 51:57.140]  I realized that's ridiculous.
[51:57.340 --> 51:58.380]  There's no way I could do it.
[51:58.380 --> 52:05.200]  But then in describing to Gavin this moment of burger confidence, I re then believed that I could do it.
[52:05.500 --> 52:06.180]  I was back in.
[52:06.420 --> 52:07.540]  I was like, this seems possible.
[52:07.820 --> 52:09.080]  I'm going to give this a go.
[52:09.220 --> 52:12.080]  As soon as we stop recording, I loaded up Paw Patrol.
[52:12.300 --> 52:13.440]  It's getting some achievements.
[52:13.740 --> 52:14.960]  We're finalizing details.
[52:15.300 --> 52:16.380]  It's not it's economically.
[52:16.660 --> 52:18.400]  I think I could do it for a game.
[52:18.620 --> 52:22.960]  You'd have to beat like six games a day every day until the end of the year.
[52:22.960 --> 52:28.320]  Yeah, well, it seems like a but like not even you don't need a thousand points per game necessarily.
[52:28.520 --> 52:33.800]  I think there are so many probably like 30 minute six hundred point games.
[52:33.940 --> 52:35.060]  It's a cost issue.
[52:35.560 --> 52:37.060]  I was willing to take the bet.
[52:37.160 --> 52:43.740]  Like if it was going to be four hundred thousand, I would have been like, yeah, you know, I mean, I may put like five hundred bucks into that bet.
[52:43.920 --> 52:44.740]  He said a million.
[52:44.760 --> 52:47.400]  I was like, I'll give you ten thousand dollars if you do that.
[52:47.400 --> 52:53.220]  And then he was trying to figure out what he would what he would have to do if he didn't make it.
[52:53.460 --> 52:56.500]  And I just suggested run the marathon.
[52:56.840 --> 52:57.700]  And he was like, no.
[52:59.280 --> 53:02.460]  Like he wouldn't even run the marathon to be a part of losing the bet.
[53:03.540 --> 53:08.580]  So your conversation with Gavin like rehydrated your burger confidence, essentially.
[53:09.340 --> 53:09.780]  How many?
[53:10.040 --> 53:14.740]  We have a friend named Ray who used to work with us who has a pretty pretty lofty gamer score.
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.040]  Has he hit a million yet?
[53:16.040 --> 53:17.900]  Oh, I think he's over two million.
[53:18.100 --> 53:20.680]  Oh, OK. Well, shit, maybe you can do it.
[53:21.460 --> 53:27.660]  It's so funny that he wasn't even the first person to hit a million gamers score who has the name Ray.
[53:28.300 --> 53:29.500]  Yeah, that's pretty funny.
[53:29.740 --> 53:31.100]  We met that other dude, right?
[53:31.280 --> 53:32.300]  Yeah, Stallion.
[53:32.520 --> 53:32.800]  He's great.
[53:32.880 --> 53:33.820]  Yeah, he's a nice guy.
[53:34.420 --> 53:37.520]  Yeah, I mean, I'm inclined to believe you could do it as well.
[53:37.560 --> 53:38.900]  It's a fucking lofty goal.
[53:39.220 --> 53:40.280]  I think seven hundred seven.
[53:40.820 --> 53:41.580]  Fuck, dude.
[53:42.020 --> 53:42.400]  Fuck.
[53:42.740 --> 53:43.000]  Four.
[53:43.740 --> 53:44.980]  You really think you could?
[53:44.980 --> 53:46.500]  Yeah, I think I could do it.
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.780]  You don't think you've blown through all the fast games already?
[53:48.940 --> 53:52.920]  No, because I stopped doing that like 360 era.
[53:53.440 --> 53:58.440]  So I feel like I have all of Xbox One and the current generation to work with.
[53:58.700 --> 54:01.240]  I have a few on Xbox One that are like the easy ones, but...
[54:01.240 --> 54:02.480]  You would never be able to go outside.
[54:03.040 --> 54:05.280]  No, I don't think it would be as extensive as you think.
[54:05.340 --> 54:08.000]  There's a lot of like in an hour get a thousand point games.
[54:08.260 --> 54:11.320]  And I haven't done the extensive research to know how many of them there are.
[54:11.320 --> 54:15.420]  I could be so wrong and that I think there's hundreds where there isn't.
[54:15.560 --> 54:18.120]  You couldn't even write 20,000 things down.
[54:18.580 --> 54:20.280]  I don't know what that has to do with anything.
[54:20.620 --> 54:21.720]  That's just a side fact.
[54:22.940 --> 54:25.160]  So how much gamerscore are you going to need?
[54:25.420 --> 54:27.620]  I'd need like 680,000.
[54:28.800 --> 54:30.380]  680,000 gamerscore.
[54:30.480 --> 54:32.120]  And what month? This is September.
[54:32.720 --> 54:34.900]  So you have five months to get 680,000.
[54:34.900 --> 54:36.620]  Okay, this was a week ago.
[54:37.200 --> 54:37.780]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[54:38.360 --> 54:40.240]  Five months and a week.
[54:40.240 --> 54:45.920]  I've had this gamer tag since, well, probably coming in on two decades.
[54:46.240 --> 54:48.900]  And I've got 95,000 gamerscore.
[54:49.480 --> 54:51.020]  Yeah, I think you kind of suck though.
[54:51.220 --> 54:52.580]  I suck though, but still.
[54:53.580 --> 54:54.600]  That's so much.
[54:54.960 --> 54:55.840]  It is a lot.
[54:56.180 --> 54:58.680]  I thought Gavin was going to bring up what happened in Halo.
[54:59.140 --> 55:01.340]  Because Halo recently added ranked doubles.
[55:01.920 --> 55:03.520]  And we haven't played in a very long time.
[55:03.820 --> 55:05.340]  So I thought, oh, it'd be fun to do.
[55:05.400 --> 55:08.420]  Because when it came out, we did ranked and that was fun.
[55:08.420 --> 55:11.160]  So why don't we do, we qualify, you have to play ten games.
[55:11.660 --> 55:13.520]  And then you get qualified for your rank.
[55:14.500 --> 55:16.900]  And it was doubles specifically, which is a new playlist.
[55:17.300 --> 55:18.420]  We went through the ten games.
[55:19.100 --> 55:20.900]  Gavin, your previous rank was gold four.
[55:21.760 --> 55:24.020]  What is your current rank after playing ten games?
[55:24.100 --> 55:24.800]  Where did it place you?
[55:26.620 --> 55:29.660]  Before he answers, can you just go, because I haven't done it.
[55:29.980 --> 55:33.020]  And I imagine a lot of the audience doesn't know what the fuck that means.
[55:33.460 --> 55:34.700]  What is the scale?
[55:34.700 --> 55:38.780]  So it starts, I think bronze is as low as you can go.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.160]  And it goes bronze one through five.
[55:41.480 --> 55:42.900]  And then silver one through five.
[55:42.940 --> 55:44.560]  So is five the highest bronze?
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.680]  Five is the highest bronze.
[55:46.840 --> 55:48.180]  And then it goes silver one.
[55:48.380 --> 55:50.480]  Silver one, yeah, you go through that scale.
[55:50.740 --> 55:54.280]  All the way up, I think it goes silver, gold, platinum.
[55:55.260 --> 55:57.240]  And then I want to say, then it's onyx, right?
[55:57.280 --> 55:58.300]  I don't think there's a diamond.
[55:58.460 --> 56:01.520]  I think platinum, and then the highest level is onyx.
[56:01.660 --> 56:02.360]  Oh, I thought it was a diamond.
[56:02.360 --> 56:04.060]  Maybe there is, I don't remember.
[56:04.240 --> 56:06.300]  I think you just skipped it because you were onyx once.
[56:06.600 --> 56:10.580]  I worked, my first ranking was gold four.
[56:10.880 --> 56:13.820]  And then I slowly, that was the rank it gave me after my ten games.
[56:14.020 --> 56:16.820]  And then I was slowly able to climb gold five.
[56:16.940 --> 56:19.800]  And then I eventually got platinum one, was the highest I've been.
[56:20.480 --> 56:26.100]  And last night, or the night before, I got ranked silver four.
[56:28.620 --> 56:31.660]  It's the most disappointed I've ever heard Gavin in my life.
[56:31.660 --> 56:35.340]  Yeah, I was ready for something shitty, but that made me sad.
[56:35.520 --> 56:37.320]  Do you think that's because of your ankles?
[56:39.200 --> 56:39.880]  I don't think so.
[56:40.140 --> 56:45.580]  What do you ascribe your dramatic drop in Halo score to?
[56:45.860 --> 56:46.620]  Not very good.
[56:50.400 --> 56:52.860]  Do you think you've gotten worse, or did people get better?
[56:54.480 --> 56:56.120]  I hope it's the second one.
[57:01.220 --> 57:02.500]  I went up one.
[57:02.500 --> 57:06.660]  So last time we did this, I was platinum one. I got ranked platinum two.
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.180]  So I went up one level, and Gavin got dropped down an entire class.
[57:11.620 --> 57:12.720]  That made me very happy.
[57:13.420 --> 57:16.480]  I don't know if the audience is going to pick up on this,
[57:16.700 --> 57:18.300]  but I've known Gavin for a very long time.
[57:18.440 --> 57:22.040]  There is so much legitimate pain in the way he said those things.
[57:22.400 --> 57:29.860]  There was a lot of really subtle, but raw, raw emotion in that.
[57:29.860 --> 57:33.860]  This has got to be... you must be crestfallen.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.720]  What makes it even funnier?
[57:39.680 --> 57:43.660]  I've been fucking... I'm laughing so hard, I'm dying.
[57:44.180 --> 57:46.640]  Oh my god, oh fuck, it's so funny.
[57:46.820 --> 57:48.580]  What do you attribute that to?
[57:48.920 --> 57:49.840]  Not very good.
[57:51.760 --> 57:56.460]  So you're old, your body's falling apart, and you suck at Halo.
[57:57.020 --> 57:59.040]  It's like we're twins!
[57:59.960 --> 58:01.520]  So many outs.
[58:01.700 --> 58:05.520]  So many outs to say, like, oh, I was distracted by this,
[58:05.620 --> 58:06.960]  or this thing happened, or whatever.
[58:07.540 --> 58:09.960]  And it was just brass tacks.
[58:10.100 --> 58:11.120]  Yeah, I fucking suck.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.880]  What made it so enjoyable was the fact he had to play ten games to get that.
[58:20.140 --> 58:24.420]  You had to put in so much effort to just be disappointed and insulted.
[58:29.240 --> 58:31.880]  And it's my favorite game. I love Halo.
[58:32.900 --> 58:39.280]  I was going to, as a joke, delete the game after that happened, but then I remembered it's like a 120 gig game and I really don't want to read that one.
[58:41.220 --> 58:42.440]  Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
[58:42.680 --> 58:48.240]  It's, uh, well, you know, the hand-eye coordination is probably not what it used to be in your body.
[58:48.400 --> 58:50.360]  And, you know, the eyes, they...
[58:51.140 --> 58:53.580]  As you get older, they lose a little bit of their sharpness.
[58:54.900 --> 58:57.720]  Alright, I've got to try and get to gold this week.
[58:57.720 --> 58:59.500]  Yeah, let's try to get you there.
[58:59.800 --> 59:07.880]  Do you think a strict regimen of practice and playing will help, or would it be easier to build a time machine?
[59:08.900 --> 59:09.800]  Probably the second one.
[59:10.100 --> 59:12.720]  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking, too. Probably more plausible, too.
[59:12.980 --> 59:13.760]  That's the luck, though.
[59:15.680 --> 59:18.380]  I really want Andrew to try and get a million before the end of the year, though.
[59:19.160 --> 59:27.300]  Financially, if I was looking at... I did a little bit of research, and it seemed like some of the easiest games, the average price is like $10.
[59:27.920 --> 59:31.680]  So if I have to buy like 600 games, I'm looking at $6,000 minimum.
[59:31.960 --> 59:37.180]  What if we try to buy someone's bulk video game collection off eBay? Like, all pre-used.
[59:38.180 --> 59:41.840]  I think most of these easy gamer score games never had a physical release.
[59:42.180 --> 59:43.580]  It's a tough thing to work around.
[59:43.580 --> 59:50.820]  I'm not opposed to it. I could get $400,000. How long could that reasonably take? Tuesday.
[59:51.400 --> 59:53.040]  I think half a million has got to be the goal.
[59:53.360 --> 59:53.940]  Half a million?
[59:54.400 --> 59:55.960]  Yeah, I think a million is impossible.
[59:56.400 --> 01:00:02.460]  Yeah, I think a million is... I would sneeze at half a million. That's easy. I could do that. No problem.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.480]  Yeah? And if you don't, do you have to run the marathon?
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.520]  Nah, we never said that. I mean, that was off the table before.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.240]  So wait, I feel a legitimate bet forming.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.540]  I think, yeah, I agree. There's some...
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:21.300]  Half a million gamer score by January 1st, 2023.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.000]  Okay.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.340]  You are at what right now?
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.860]  I'm at like $328,000.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:30.820]  So you need to get roughly $180,000.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.940]  Oh, it's easy. Oh, it's so easy.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:37.940]  Between now and... which is the equivalent of... how is that? 180 games?
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.840]  He has 329,621 currently.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.960]  So you have to 100% roughly 200 games to do this.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:46.240]  Yeah.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.740]  In five months.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.300]  Oh, that's so easy.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:57.080]  Now, Gav, what are you prepared... surely you're not going for the full 10,000 for such a paltry gamer score. It's 500... half a million.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.560]  What are you prepared to pony up?
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.600]  I mean, what was fair? Probably like a thousand.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.000]  He's going to do it though.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.620]  What if it's not money? What if it's something...
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.060]  I don't know. What do you think, Andrew?
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.360]  I have no idea. I feel weird about the... I'm not going to request money.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.660]  I do think it's funny that we cut it in half and you cut the amount by 90%.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.200]  That was a fascinating move.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:26.560]  Well, I was basing it on... I thought I would give 500 for 400,000 and then you went 500,000, so I just doubled it.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.460]  I don't know. I did offer rights to my gamertag.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.400]  He said I could pick his new gamertag.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.140]  Yeah, I can't change it unless that was something I put up.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.440]  Now that's interesting.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.480]  See, I don't like the money angle. I like it's better if it's punishment or something like that.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:49.340]  Yeah, why don't we keep money out of it? I have to do something if you do it and you have to let me change your gamertag if you don't.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.140]  Well then, it becomes... I don't know. We'll think about it. We'll see if we can think of something.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.880]  Alright, we're in the early stages of this.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.400]  There might be something.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:05.280]  What if Gavin... If you do it, Gavin can only wear large shirts for two months.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.000]  No.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.640]  Well, that's pretty good.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.840]  No, it's not.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.200]  If I'm buying 180 games...
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:17.920]  And he has to take a photo in a large shirt and send it to you every day to prove that he's in a large shirt.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:18.840]  No.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.480]  That's not worth it.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.660]  I think you're underestimating how miserable that's going to make Gavin specifically.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.960]  Probably, yeah. I just don't... That's not a trade I would make.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.260]  Okay, well, listen. We can keep working behind the scenes to figure this out.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.020]  Maybe we can come up with a solution by next episode recording.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.700]  But the clock is ticking while we figure out what the rewards slash punishments will be.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.880]  How long have you had Andrew Penton as a gamertag?
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.720]  Uh... 2008.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:48.520]  Okay.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.160]  It's been a while.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:50.860]  Long time.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.320]  Quite a long time. I would never personally change it.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.940]  Well, you better get half a million gamers for them.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.500]  I can't believe that I'm going to end both of these fucking recordings rushing to play PAW Patrol.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.060]  That's the shock of the year.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.720]  So you're already going to be starting before we decided to bet?
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.460]  We talked about that the previous time.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.660]  Because as Geoff said, I'm running low on time.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.800]  No, but I said under the assumption that this will be a thing, I need to start getting reps in.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:18.940]  I'm running out of time.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.480]  We're now in Q4, is that right?
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.440]  Oh no, that's not right. Next month.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.540]  Next month's Q4.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.920]  Okay. Maybe it starts Q4.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.240]  Maybe. Yeah. We'll work it out. We'll figure it out. I think there's something here.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:29.940]  Good deal.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:34.180]  I think maybe something in person. Like maybe Gavin has to deliver something to your door.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.000]  I don't know. That doesn't move the needle for me.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:45.720]  Gavin having to leave America, get on a plane, go all the way to Canada with his busy schedule to then like, I don't know, clean your bathroom or something?
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.020]  I am thinking of it that way.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.300]  Like it's an incredible inconvenience and imposition to him.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.800]  Yeah, let me buy a hazmat suit and I'll get around that.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.400]  I'll schedule a lunch.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:59.820]  And then I'll get a great, I'll get a mist, a guilt basket.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:06.140]  Eric really wants us to stop talking. He's told us to wrap up 30 times. So we should probably do that.
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.680]  Thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast number 120.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.760]  Tune in next week. If if there's no podcast, it's because I walked away. Bye.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.340]  Don't walk away. Please don't.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.360]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.100]  Check out the butthole Tupperware. The gang talks about their favorite Japanese foods.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.640]  Is a Burzoi the longest dog? How are Pantin's ankles?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.980]  Let's assume the guys talk about medium some more. And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.940]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
