[00:15.250 --> 00:20.790]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:20.990 --> 00:26.490]  With me as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Free, my two favorite people in the world.
[00:26.670 --> 00:29.830]  Sorry, Millie, but you're not listening to this anyway, so it's okay.
[00:31.370 --> 00:33.970]  What episode are we at? Does anybody have any idea?
[00:34.550 --> 00:35.670]  121, I believe.
[00:35.890 --> 00:36.310]  Yeah, 121.
[00:36.310 --> 00:44.350]  Once I quit chronicling year, volume, et cetera, et cetera, season, I just completely lost it.
[00:44.470 --> 00:47.810]  I'll be honest, I was a fan of the volumes and the chapters, the years and the volumes and all that.
[00:47.870 --> 00:49.690]  I was too, Gavin, I was too.
[00:50.210 --> 00:55.350]  I don't... I feel like we weren't against it as much as I didn't understand the system.
[00:55.570 --> 00:56.450]  I was confused by it.
[00:56.730 --> 01:02.230]  Andrew and Eric refused. They were very against it. They were very clearly against it.
[01:02.430 --> 01:04.390]  They said, no, no more, Geoff.
[01:04.390 --> 01:06.190]  I said, fine, you know.
[01:06.430 --> 01:07.550]  We have no Nick and Eric today.
[01:07.950 --> 01:10.090]  We wore those little guys out this morning, Gavin.
[01:10.490 --> 01:13.390]  We went out. It was baseball's round two. How'd it go?
[01:14.090 --> 01:15.530]  I'm very excited to hear about this.
[01:16.090 --> 01:20.290]  Well, let me... You know what? I mean, I know how I think it went. Let me ask you, Gav, how do you think it went?
[01:20.870 --> 01:25.670]  I think you came out there. You were potentially in worse shape. You've been recently injured.
[01:26.110 --> 01:26.990]  Easily in worse shape.
[01:27.910 --> 01:30.930]  And you cracked out more hits than you did last time.
[01:31.010 --> 01:31.770]  Are you serious?
[01:32.670 --> 01:36.150]  I think you had a streak of about 15 hits at one point.
[01:36.690 --> 01:38.630]  Geoff, that's ridiculous.
[01:39.170 --> 01:42.390]  I had a good morning, I'll say. Gavin is right, dude.
[01:43.590 --> 01:46.730]  I am in worse shape than last time I hit the balls.
[01:46.930 --> 01:49.350]  That is not by design.
[01:49.610 --> 01:58.870]  It is the unfortunate side effect of having the jock itch and the bike falls and the vasectomy.
[01:59.410 --> 02:03.190]  I just haven't been able to get on my bike or do any kind of exercise pretty much all summer.
[02:03.370 --> 02:09.250]  And so I came in about 10 pounds heavier and way worse. I came very close to vomiting twice.
[02:10.290 --> 02:10.690]  Really?
[02:11.190 --> 02:16.150]  Yeah, I had to take breaks to go sit in the dugout and pour water on my head.
[02:16.570 --> 02:21.970]  Yeah, he had to sit in the breeze and he was just sort of led over, trying not to hurt.
[02:22.430 --> 02:28.190]  Yeah, I was very close to vomiting. Very close. But I was able to hold it in.
[02:29.190 --> 02:34.190]  Yeah, and so we went to a different ballpark. This one, the fence was at 315 feet.
[02:34.370 --> 02:37.010]  So not the, I don't know, maybe 200 the other one was.
[02:37.550 --> 02:41.530]  I will say I fucking tried my hardest. I did not hit one out of the park.
[02:42.530 --> 02:43.770]  But I got close.
[02:44.250 --> 02:50.730]  I was pinging 270 pretty consistently, I think.
[02:50.850 --> 02:53.550]  One of them looked pretty like 290-ish from where I was stood.
[02:53.550 --> 03:00.930]  Yeah, and I think, I'll go ahead and say it, I'm 100% sure I can hit one over that fence.
[03:01.810 --> 03:04.390]  And I don't want to make excuses, A, being out of shape.
[03:04.770 --> 03:09.450]  But B, that bat, I use the same bat, you know, because it's the only one I have.
[03:09.550 --> 03:15.330]  It's getting pretty gammy. It probably weighs an extra four pounds and it's got like dirt
[03:15.330 --> 03:17.350]  shit sticking off of it and grass.
[03:17.950 --> 03:19.750]  It's probably like an inch wider than it was.
[03:20.590 --> 03:23.150]  It's not the best bat in the world to hit.
[03:23.650 --> 03:24.530]  Balls with anymore.
[03:24.710 --> 03:26.710]  But, you know, I price consistency.
[03:27.170 --> 03:30.390]  And then the pitching machine this time was wackadoo.
[03:30.590 --> 03:34.810]  I would say like Andrew probably one out of every four pitches was a strike over the plate.
[03:35.410 --> 03:35.590]  Really?
[03:35.730 --> 03:40.810]  And that got pretty frustrating because I hit about 200 balls today,
[03:40.910 --> 03:43.410]  maybe 225, somewhere on there was my limit.
[03:44.130 --> 03:45.430]  And that's it. That's it.
[03:45.470 --> 03:47.290]  Like from this point on, we're going to do it again.
[03:47.350 --> 03:48.850]  We have another 250 balls.
[03:49.310 --> 03:50.490]  That's going to be where we do that.
[03:50.870 --> 03:51.710]  That's where we get in.
[03:51.710 --> 03:52.350]  That's what we do.
[03:52.430 --> 03:56.910]  The different dips of paint and Gavin and Nick and Eric can hit.
[03:57.070 --> 03:58.990]  And we can just everybody can have their own color signature.
[03:59.230 --> 04:03.270]  And we, you know, let's get a better pitching machine for that one.
[04:03.550 --> 04:04.230]  Let's get a better pitching.
[04:04.350 --> 04:04.770]  Well, yeah, sure.
[04:04.790 --> 04:06.290]  Now that you guys are going to hit, we'll get a better pitch.
[04:07.270 --> 04:09.930]  Because I don't know if it came across in the videos last time,
[04:09.970 --> 04:14.650]  but that pitching machine is it basically is like a leaf blower tube cut in half.
[04:14.810 --> 04:16.530]  Yeah, the spinning tire inside.
[04:16.870 --> 04:20.350]  And every time you drop a ball in the tire grips it and throws the ball.
[04:20.350 --> 04:23.390]  What you don't really see is that the tire is now spinning at like
[04:23.830 --> 04:25.530]  30% the speed that it was before.
[04:25.630 --> 04:27.690]  So you can't immediately dump another ball.
[04:27.870 --> 04:28.050]  Yeah.
[04:28.270 --> 04:29.310]  Because it doesn't come out very fast.
[04:29.490 --> 04:31.930]  So you have to wait for it to spin up to speed.
[04:32.070 --> 04:34.690]  And if it goes too fast and it goes too high, it's a nightmare.
[04:34.870 --> 04:35.170]  That thing.
[04:35.670 --> 04:37.750]  So is it the same machine that you used last time?
[04:37.770 --> 04:38.330]  It's the same machine.
[04:38.330 --> 04:41.630]  Was it as bad the first time or has it just...
[04:41.630 --> 04:42.230]  It's gotten worse.
[04:42.430 --> 04:43.210]  It's gotten way worse.
[04:43.710 --> 04:44.070]  Fascinating.
[04:45.290 --> 04:46.010]  Way worse.
[04:46.010 --> 04:50.290]  And it's frustrating, too, because the first pitch will be nine feet high,
[04:50.470 --> 04:54.330]  and then the second feet will hit the ground three and a half feet before the plate.
[04:54.750 --> 04:59.430]  And then the third pitch takes a dog leg right at my crotch.
[04:59.590 --> 05:01.170]  And then the fourth pitch will be a strike.
[05:02.250 --> 05:04.550]  So I started to get so frustrated.
[05:05.030 --> 05:06.910]  And I just stopped trying to hit dingers.
[05:07.390 --> 05:08.050]  And I just tried...
[05:08.050 --> 05:10.870]  Because I was just getting bored of watching pitches go by.
[05:10.990 --> 05:13.110]  And I was having a lot of luck signing them.
[05:13.390 --> 05:15.690]  The signatures look way better this time around.
[05:16.010 --> 05:18.210]  Because I was liberal.
[05:18.990 --> 05:21.170]  I was Bernie Sanders with the paint, dude.
[05:22.770 --> 05:25.190]  And it was slinging everywhere.
[05:26.230 --> 05:27.930]  And so I just... I was like, fuck it.
[05:27.950 --> 05:29.670]  I'm going to swing for every single bad pitch.
[05:29.710 --> 05:33.050]  And I was able to connect with 99% of them just because I wasn't trying to put it over the fence.
[05:33.830 --> 05:35.010]  It was still so much fun, though.
[05:35.130 --> 05:35.590]  So much fun.
[05:35.590 --> 05:40.650]  I didn't bring my big camera this time just because I need to use it soon for other work.
[05:40.710 --> 05:42.870]  And I don't want it covered in paint or smashed.
[05:42.870 --> 05:43.790]  So I use my phone.
[05:43.870 --> 05:48.530]  And now the back of my phone has a nice sort of bumpy house paint job.
[05:49.030 --> 05:51.230]  And there's a little bit of black paint on my green card.
[05:51.310 --> 05:53.050]  Which I'm going to try to scratch off at some point.
[05:53.270 --> 05:55.670]  Because I'm dumb and I left my wallet on the back of it.
[05:57.130 --> 06:02.150]  I've been pulling black paint out of my arm here all day.
[06:04.370 --> 06:05.830]  Except for the right side.
[06:06.130 --> 06:06.790]  Where I was like, oh, weird.
[06:06.850 --> 06:08.230]  There's no black paint on this side.
[06:08.230 --> 06:08.670]  I wonder why.
[06:08.670 --> 06:13.010]  And then I remembered over the weekend or Monday for Labor Day.
[06:13.070 --> 06:16.090]  I grilled a really nice steak for Emily and I.
[06:16.230 --> 06:18.970]  And I was not paying attention to what I was doing.
[06:19.090 --> 06:21.250]  I was listening to a podcast or something while I was grilling.
[06:21.650 --> 06:24.050]  And I squirted a little bit too much lighter fluid.
[06:25.470 --> 06:30.270]  And I set off a bomb that burned all of the hair off of my right arm.
[06:31.910 --> 06:33.970]  Didn't cause any damage to the skin.
[06:34.250 --> 06:36.370]  But I came back inside and I held it up to Emily.
[06:36.470 --> 06:37.510]  And I was just like, look at this.
[06:37.510 --> 06:40.130]  And she was like, oh, my God, do we need to go to the hospital?
[06:40.350 --> 06:43.950]  And I was like, I just took my hand and brushed my arm here.
[06:44.030 --> 06:48.570]  And it just all hit the ground in like little, little burnt nug little nubbins.
[06:49.010 --> 06:52.370]  It was that's really a clear example of how Emily are different.
[06:52.370 --> 06:54.450]  Because if you came in like that, my first thought would be,
[06:54.570 --> 06:56.010]  oh, my God, are the steaks OK?
[06:56.650 --> 06:58.110]  Why is that the steak on yet?
[06:58.610 --> 06:59.010]  Fantastic.
[07:00.230 --> 07:03.250]  Oh, well, I think you're stronger than a machine is what we've established.
[07:03.410 --> 07:06.350]  You're better built than the machine used to pitch the ball.
[07:06.350 --> 07:10.290]  You've only improved over time when it has lessened.
[07:10.630 --> 07:12.230]  Here's what pisses me off about it, too.
[07:13.650 --> 07:19.310]  I hit a rhythm about a hundred balls in when I was like,
[07:19.350 --> 07:22.590]  I was really, really starting to see the ball.
[07:22.750 --> 07:26.850]  I was making contact nine out of every ten pitches that I swung at.
[07:27.610 --> 07:32.930]  And I was hitting them pretty consistently, like to about 250 to 275 dead center field.
[07:33.610 --> 07:36.110]  And that's also like right as I'm dialing in
[07:36.110 --> 07:37.290]  and I'm starting to hit my groove.
[07:37.470 --> 07:41.270]  That's also when my body starts to shut down for lack of cardio.
[07:41.950 --> 07:46.570]  And so like right as I was like starting to feel it, I started to feel it the other way.
[07:46.730 --> 07:51.490]  And so it was like a constant battle between like, man, it's like the epitome of the mind is willing,
[07:51.650 --> 07:54.450]  you know, but the body, the body's this fucking dickhead.
[07:55.790 --> 07:59.010]  Yeah, I I'm actually I was thinking about on the way home.
[07:59.110 --> 08:02.330]  I'm actually kind of mad at myself for the alcoholism thing,
[08:02.330 --> 08:06.190]  because if I hadn't been so distracted by booze in my 30s,
[08:06.290 --> 08:08.270]  I could have played so much fucking baseball.
[08:08.710 --> 08:09.950]  It is so much fun.
[08:10.190 --> 08:16.690]  And I feel so like, I don't know, maybe it's just like growing up in America
[08:16.690 --> 08:18.550]  and watching baseball all the time and playing little league and shit.
[08:18.570 --> 08:19.930]  But I just feel so connected to it.
[08:20.130 --> 08:23.330]  Like it just feels like it just like it just feels I feel good at it.
[08:23.350 --> 08:24.490]  You know, like I want to do it more.
[08:24.690 --> 08:24.850]  Yeah.
[08:25.350 --> 08:29.510]  At one point after you came back for a rest after hitting probably 80 balls,
[08:30.450 --> 08:33.690]  you said it was after you were slumped over trying not to vomit.
[08:33.870 --> 08:36.690]  You just went back and you were like, man, I hate this age.
[08:42.790 --> 08:46.750]  It's easy to forget that I was a fucking 47 year old dude out there doing that, you know?
[08:47.730 --> 08:51.310]  So are you going to try to pursue playing baseball recreationally?
[08:51.350 --> 08:54.610]  Or do you think it's specifically the hitting part of the game you enjoy?
[08:55.170 --> 08:58.370]  Do you think you'd have fun in an actual game or you're on second base or whatever?
[08:58.370 --> 09:01.870]  Yeah, I would love to play like sandlot baseball.
[09:02.050 --> 09:04.570]  I love I love I like to pitch.
[09:05.930 --> 09:07.190]  I would love to play.
[09:07.250 --> 09:08.510]  I'm scared to death to play an infield.
[09:08.650 --> 09:09.970]  It's too it's too much math.
[09:10.170 --> 09:10.870]  It's too it's too mean.
[09:11.070 --> 09:13.050]  It's like too much knowing which scenario to throw to.
[09:13.310 --> 09:14.770]  So I much prefer to play outfield.
[09:16.690 --> 09:18.790]  But we're worst case scenario, just throw the ball home.
[09:19.070 --> 09:19.670]  You know, you can't go wrong.
[09:19.810 --> 09:23.330]  Yeah, because, you know, it's baseball gets stressful in the moment.
[09:23.550 --> 09:27.910]  It's all about making snap decisions and making the right snap decision based on the environment.
[09:28.910 --> 09:32.270]  And but I don't think so, because I'm just not good at scheduling stuff.
[09:32.390 --> 09:35.410]  Now, you know, I'm at the age where it's like it's hard for me to show up an appointment at an
[09:35.410 --> 09:37.490]  appointment or to want to make an appointment.
[09:37.710 --> 09:39.350]  And so I just like life.
[09:39.390 --> 09:43.430]  Life so gets in the way, you know, every day that I just don't think it's a reality.
[09:43.610 --> 09:47.690]  But I'll continue to hit these baseballs as long as the audience wants autographed baseballs.
[09:47.830 --> 09:49.970]  I'm it is so much fun to do.
[09:50.030 --> 09:53.090]  And I'm so excited to get Gavin and Eric and Nick involved, too.
[09:53.570 --> 09:56.650]  There were, I think, way more signed balls from this batch.
[09:56.650 --> 10:01.050]  So I think if you buy from this lot, you're more likely to get a nice paint stain.
[10:01.690 --> 10:02.330]  Yeah. Interesting.
[10:02.810 --> 10:06.370]  I didn't I didn't I didn't strike out a lot today.
[10:10.410 --> 10:12.470]  Also, Blaine and Andrew showed up to help.
[10:12.850 --> 10:13.490]  Not you, Andrew.
[10:13.650 --> 10:17.610]  The Ericsson Andrew showed up to to help catch balls.
[10:17.630 --> 10:18.650]  And that was really appreciative, too.
[10:18.710 --> 10:20.090]  So I want to say thank you to them.
[10:20.530 --> 10:20.970]  Sweet.
[10:21.450 --> 10:21.590]  Yeah.
[10:22.170 --> 10:24.250]  That's why he gave me sunscreen and lent me a hat.
[10:25.550 --> 10:26.570]  Blaine gave Gavin...
[10:27.270 --> 10:29.750]  I thought he was being funny, but I don't think he was.
[10:30.150 --> 10:31.490]  No, he was being helpful.
[10:31.550 --> 10:31.910]  He knew what he was doing.
[10:32.210 --> 10:32.890]  I don't know.
[10:33.990 --> 10:36.910]  He brought a tube of the most viscous sunscreen.
[10:37.270 --> 10:38.410]  It was like it came out like toothpaste.
[10:38.850 --> 10:40.850]  And he just was squeezing it on my hand.
[10:41.110 --> 10:42.870]  And it was like, you got enough? You need more?
[10:42.950 --> 10:45.530]  And he just kept squeezing it into like a big dog turd on my hand.
[10:46.030 --> 10:47.570]  And I couldn't rub it all in.
[10:47.770 --> 10:48.750]  I was offering it around.
[10:49.030 --> 10:50.990]  And eventually I just smeared it on my shin.
[10:51.030 --> 10:53.790]  And I just kept a mound of sunscreen on my shin for the entire day.
[10:54.490 --> 10:56.650]  Using it from my leg and stuff.
[10:56.990 --> 10:59.270]  Did you see him use the sunscreen, Gavin?
[11:00.190 --> 11:00.710]  Oh.
[11:01.930 --> 11:02.450]  No.
[11:03.670 --> 11:04.590]  I didn't either.
[11:04.930 --> 11:05.690]  I didn't either. Interesting.
[11:06.290 --> 11:06.450]  Interesting.
[11:06.450 --> 11:07.410]  Colgate makes sunscreen, right?
[11:07.410 --> 11:08.070]  We'll see how you're feeling tomorrow.
[11:14.750 --> 11:18.570]  Matt, can I tell you guys, before we get off the baseball thing,
[11:18.870 --> 11:23.190]  I encountered a little bit of friction with my girlfriend
[11:23.710 --> 11:25.690]  over this for like the first time.
[11:26.090 --> 11:26.330]  Oh no.
[11:26.530 --> 11:27.170]  Not bad.
[11:27.570 --> 11:31.030]  But like the other day, or it was actually last night.
[11:31.130 --> 11:33.130]  She was like, what do you got going on the rest of the week?
[11:33.150 --> 11:35.130]  And I was like, oh, I'm getting up and hitting the baseballs tomorrow morning.
[11:35.310 --> 11:36.670]  And she goes, really?
[11:37.130 --> 11:37.790]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[11:37.970 --> 11:40.750]  And she's like, you can barely walk.
[11:42.070 --> 11:44.330]  You're just now getting over your bike injury.
[11:45.010 --> 11:48.110]  Before that, it was the jock itch and the vasectomy.
[11:48.290 --> 11:49.750]  And then the jock itch before that.
[11:50.990 --> 11:55.070]  You've been a neutered physical mess for like three months.
[11:55.290 --> 11:58.290]  And do you remember how you felt after the last time you hit the baseballs?
[11:58.490 --> 11:59.770]  And I was like, I felt pretty bad.
[11:59.990 --> 12:00.990]  And she was like, you were fucked up.
[12:01.010 --> 12:02.690]  You were fucked up for three straight weeks.
[12:02.750 --> 12:03.430]  And I was like, yeah.
[12:03.890 --> 12:06.050]  And she's like, and you're going to do that again tomorrow.
[12:06.350 --> 12:07.470]  And I was like, I guess so.
[12:07.530 --> 12:08.450]  And she's just like, ugh.
[12:10.210 --> 12:14.290]  And then today, I was so excited.
[12:14.770 --> 12:15.870]  Like, I knew I was in worse shape.
[12:15.950 --> 12:17.870]  But I was thinking like, I'm going to stretch better.
[12:18.110 --> 12:19.210]  I know what to expect.
[12:19.210 --> 12:20.890]  So I think I'll probably fare better, right?
[12:21.690 --> 12:22.050]  Physically.
[12:22.230 --> 12:24.210]  And I feel, by the way, I feel fucking great right now.
[12:25.290 --> 12:26.250]  I came home.
[12:26.430 --> 12:30.230]  I immediately ran a hot bath, filled it with Epsom salts.
[12:30.550 --> 12:34.530]  Got into the bathtub and thought, I'm just going to sit here and let my muscles relax.
[12:34.770 --> 12:36.190]  And I'll be completely okay.
[12:36.630 --> 12:39.610]  I looked at my phone and it said 12 19 p.m.
[12:39.630 --> 12:41.490]  And I thought, why does that matter to me?
[12:41.670 --> 12:43.210]  I don't have f*** face till three o'clock.
[12:43.370 --> 12:44.650]  Why would I care that it's...
[12:44.650 --> 12:46.230]  Why does 12 19 seem bad?
[12:46.530 --> 12:47.530]  And I was like, ugh.
[12:47.530 --> 12:50.990]  So then I like slowly hit my calendar.
[12:51.750 --> 12:55.910]  And sure enough, I was supposed to be at Rooster Teeth at one o'clock to do this interview show thing.
[12:56.010 --> 12:57.490]  And I was like, god damn it.
[12:57.490 --> 13:01.170]  And I had to rush out of the bath and then throw clothes on and then immediately go to work.
[13:01.450 --> 13:06.930]  I took a 45 second bath and then immediately returned back to work.
[13:08.650 --> 13:10.030]  You now know my pain.
[13:10.830 --> 13:13.890]  When I saw Gavin, you already beat the Halo time.
[13:13.890 --> 13:17.730]  You can now relate to the sadness of realizing you have to get out
[13:17.730 --> 13:19.370]  immediately as soon as you're getting in.
[13:20.210 --> 13:20.690]  Absolutely, dude.
[13:20.870 --> 13:21.210]  It's crushing.
[13:21.330 --> 13:22.510]  I feel your pain. It sucks.
[13:23.030 --> 13:26.830]  What's kind of interesting about all the baseballs we hit is that I'm pretty sure
[13:26.830 --> 13:30.850]  some of them were hit while the queen was alive and some of them were hit after she died.
[13:31.230 --> 13:32.890]  Like that's exactly what we were doing.
[13:33.290 --> 13:34.850]  I think the moment Queen Elizabeth died.
[13:34.850 --> 13:37.450]  Yeah, my condolences.
[13:39.990 --> 13:44.130]  Honest condolences to everybody affected by the Queen's death.
[13:44.250 --> 13:45.290]  I was very, very sad of it.
[13:45.810 --> 13:46.730]  Hell of a life.
[13:47.250 --> 13:52.630]  I read a stat today and I texted to you and Eric, Geoff, that the queen was alive
[13:52.630 --> 13:55.150]  for 30% of all the presidents.
[13:55.510 --> 13:56.150]  She was the queen.
[13:56.590 --> 13:56.850]  Yeah.
[13:57.310 --> 13:58.130]  Isn't that crazy?
[13:58.450 --> 14:02.870]  She was the queen during the presidential, I guess, 14 different presidents.
[14:02.870 --> 14:05.550]  Let's say 30% of our country, essentially.
[14:05.770 --> 14:08.530]  I mean, it doesn't shake out that way because of like how many terms the president had.
[14:08.790 --> 14:10.150]  But yeah, but still it's roughly.
[14:10.390 --> 14:14.210]  And Harry S. Truman, who only exists in history books,
[14:14.470 --> 14:19.510]  distantly exists in history books to me, was the president when she took over the monarchy.
[14:19.730 --> 14:21.130]  That is insane.
[14:21.530 --> 14:25.550]  Yeah, Winston Churchill was the prime minister when she became queen.
[14:25.610 --> 14:29.730]  And then she just put in the newest prime minister that just happened this week.
[14:29.730 --> 14:34.390]  And those two people were born 101 years apart. Those two prime ministers.
[14:34.850 --> 14:40.610]  She also presided over 15 prime ministers.
[14:41.130 --> 14:47.370]  If I survived for 30% of the presidencies, 15 prime ministers,
[14:47.970 --> 14:53.410]  but not the Game of Thrones books finishing, I would be so fucking mad. I would be livid.
[14:54.730 --> 14:56.130]  Be so frustrating.
[14:58.250 --> 15:02.230]  She was still born like 60 years before the first Game of Thrones book.
[15:02.370 --> 15:05.570]  No, I understand. But it's just, they're taking forever. They're taking a long book.
[15:05.710 --> 15:09.430]  If I was a Game of Thrones fan, I don't know if she read the books. I don't know what she was
[15:09.430 --> 15:14.650]  into from a literary perspective, but I'd be like, what are you doing? Like, I get it's tough,
[15:14.850 --> 15:16.310]  but be so frustrating.
[15:16.590 --> 15:20.310]  I got news for you. I think we're all going to be frustrated. I don't think
[15:20.750 --> 15:25.770]  I don't think J.J. or George R.R. Martin, I said J.J. Martin. I don't think George R.R. Martin
[15:25.770 --> 15:32.090]  is in any danger of finishing those last two books any time soon. And he,
[15:33.130 --> 15:37.590]  let's just say he hasn't lived as healthy a life as the Queen did, I suspect.
[15:37.930 --> 15:41.350]  How old is he? He's got to be in his 60s or 70s, right?
[15:41.590 --> 15:42.950]  I'd assume 70s, yeah.
[15:43.550 --> 15:47.290]  I just don't think there's any need for him to finish. If I was him, I don't know why I would
[15:47.290 --> 15:47.550]  finish.
[15:47.970 --> 15:48.690]  That's a weird thing.
[15:48.690 --> 15:51.190]  It's not going to please everyone. People are going to be annoyed.
[15:51.530 --> 15:52.110]  He's 73.
[15:52.630 --> 15:56.790]  Yeah, he's basically made something so successful that people are annoyed at him that it's not
[15:56.790 --> 15:57.270]  finished.
[15:57.390 --> 16:01.330]  I disagree. I think that it will please. I think that the books will please everybody
[16:01.890 --> 16:05.550]  because here's the deal. The people that love Game of Thrones, the TV show,
[16:05.630 --> 16:09.970]  aren't necessarily reading the books. And but everybody who reads the book,
[16:10.030 --> 16:12.170]  I don't know anybody who's read the books who didn't like them.
[16:12.910 --> 16:17.590]  I wonder how close the ending of the show matches with what he planned on doing.
[16:17.610 --> 16:18.150]  Very different.
[16:19.270 --> 16:19.630]  Interesting.
[16:19.770 --> 16:22.430]  Yeah. Supposedly very different. And that's part of...
[16:22.430 --> 16:22.710]  Fascinating.
[16:22.830 --> 16:25.730]  Maybe he was thinking of doing it the way the show did it and then just thought...
[16:27.130 --> 16:28.410]  It's such a weird scenario.
[16:28.770 --> 16:33.070]  Yeah, it's a great... it's a free A-B testing, right? They throw it out there.
[16:34.830 --> 16:36.630]  It's like putting your book in early access.
[16:36.630 --> 16:38.370]  I guess I'll do something different with Clegane then.
[16:38.570 --> 16:38.970]  All right.
[16:41.750 --> 16:42.590]  I have a clip.
[16:42.990 --> 16:43.370]  You have a clip?
[16:43.450 --> 16:43.930]  Oh, no.
[16:44.690 --> 16:45.690]  Gavin has a clip.
[16:45.690 --> 16:50.730]  I was informed of this yesterday and I've decided to not be concerned.
[16:51.370 --> 16:54.570]  Because last time I went on the aggressive and it actually helped me.
[16:54.770 --> 16:58.330]  I don't remember what the clip was, but it's the first time that it wasn't directed at me.
[16:59.070 --> 17:01.330]  So this time, I'm just going to let it happen.
[17:01.470 --> 17:03.330]  I'm not worried about it. I haven't planned anything.
[17:03.890 --> 17:04.630]  What's your clip, Gavin?
[17:05.230 --> 17:10.510]  This is a clip from an episode two weeks ago, September 2022.
[17:10.510 --> 17:17.870]  Previously, my chair had been broken for months and I continued to use it out of the hope that
[17:17.870 --> 17:21.650]  it would completely collapse while we're recording at one point.
[17:21.650 --> 17:24.570]  It finally... it hit its last legs last night.
[17:25.530 --> 17:30.950]  I ate shit and I was so disappointed that it was not on the show.
[17:31.470 --> 17:31.850]  I had been hoping for it.
[17:31.850 --> 17:34.970]  So this was after you talked about it breaking last time this has happened?
[17:35.110 --> 17:37.350]  Yes, this was... that was after... it was broken,
[17:37.810 --> 17:40.490]  but I was still making it work and now I had to go buy a new chair.
[17:40.510 --> 17:42.450]  So when did it dump you off?
[17:42.830 --> 17:43.750]  It dumped me yesterday.
[17:44.910 --> 17:49.150]  Okay. September 2021.
[17:49.910 --> 17:52.270]  Yesterday, my chair broke.
[17:52.710 --> 17:57.990]  I've been using a broken desk chair since before this podcast started.
[17:58.550 --> 18:01.690]  And my dream was that it would break while we were recording.
[18:02.110 --> 18:02.750]  That was the goal.
[18:03.910 --> 18:05.370]  Did I tell the same story back to back?
[18:05.510 --> 18:09.150]  And yesterday I dropped something and I went... I bent down to pick it up while
[18:09.150 --> 18:11.130]  the chair and the chair broke.
[18:11.370 --> 18:12.490]  Finally, it was the end.
[18:13.030 --> 18:13.810]  Dumped me on the floor.
[18:16.330 --> 18:17.310]  And then obviously we've got...
[18:18.910 --> 18:19.830]  I explained what had happened.
[18:20.150 --> 18:21.850]  He's like, well, you know, we'll just... we'll figure it out.
[18:21.910 --> 18:23.010]  We'll see. Let's see what happens.
[18:23.350 --> 18:25.790]  I move like an inch and the chair shatters.
[18:26.010 --> 18:27.910]  It just falls and I fall over.
[18:28.070 --> 18:30.550]  That last one's from the 4th of July party.
[18:30.890 --> 18:34.750]  I like the fact that you are a serial chair breaker.
[18:35.070 --> 18:38.790]  Almost once a year now we get a story...
[18:38.790 --> 18:42.490]  The one that you told last week, that surely wasn't the same chair.
[18:43.210 --> 18:44.750]  That was a different chair story.
[18:44.830 --> 18:46.150]  It just happened very similarly.
[18:46.630 --> 18:48.690]  Both instances, like right around the same time.
[18:48.810 --> 18:49.990]  Like it's about every September.
[18:50.430 --> 18:50.990]  That's fascinating.
[18:51.230 --> 18:53.790]  September 2022, September 2021.
[18:54.150 --> 18:57.450]  And then in November 2020, you told the 4th of July one.
[18:57.910 --> 19:02.430]  But I think you talked recently about how your chair was breaking
[19:02.430 --> 19:03.810]  and you hoped it was going to break it.
[19:03.930 --> 19:05.390]  How many chairs have you broken?
[19:05.750 --> 19:07.410]  I've broken three chairs.
[19:07.410 --> 19:10.790]  You've just documented all three chairs that broke.
[19:11.190 --> 19:11.430]  So how...
[19:12.450 --> 19:14.890]  I don't know if I told the story of the podcast.
[19:15.250 --> 19:17.950]  How the last one I had broke, why it got broken,
[19:18.410 --> 19:19.390]  was that there...
[19:19.390 --> 19:21.650]  So it has armrests on it that like go up and down.
[19:21.810 --> 19:24.370]  And it was a time in which I'd really hurt.
[19:24.530 --> 19:26.690]  Like I was dealing with an ankle issue that was really bad.
[19:27.030 --> 19:30.010]  And so my bed is level with my chair.
[19:30.350 --> 19:34.110]  And so I would roll out of the chair into the bed
[19:34.110 --> 19:36.090]  and then roll out of the bed onto the chair.
[19:36.150 --> 19:36.990]  So I'd go back and forth.
[19:36.990 --> 19:41.630]  I rolled onto the bed, forgetting to raise the armrest.
[19:41.790 --> 19:43.850]  And I took the whole chair down with me.
[19:44.110 --> 19:47.150]  And that is what initially fucked that chair up.
[19:47.330 --> 19:50.090]  Because I landed on it on its side.
[19:50.730 --> 19:51.690]  And then it was chair three?
[19:51.930 --> 19:53.770]  That was chair three. Yeah.
[19:54.010 --> 19:55.890]  And what was the issue with chair two?
[19:56.050 --> 19:59.030]  Because chair two dumped you off the day before recording as well.
[19:59.190 --> 20:01.690]  Chair two I owned for like a decade.
[20:01.930 --> 20:04.450]  And it just progressively broke over time.
[20:04.450 --> 20:07.190]  It was just a natural failing of it.
[20:07.230 --> 20:10.210]  The chair three had only a one year lifespan.
[20:10.510 --> 20:12.350]  Essentially like almost a perfect year.
[20:12.690 --> 20:16.630]  And it's ever since that fall, it could never fully recover.
[20:16.890 --> 20:19.070]  And then I partially broke it a second time,
[20:19.150 --> 20:20.790]  sort of in a similar way to the second chair,
[20:20.850 --> 20:23.670]  where the front was tilted the entire time.
[20:24.090 --> 20:28.690]  And then it just it finally gave when I went into the Tony Hawk grind mode
[20:28.690 --> 20:30.270]  trying to pick something up off the floor.
[20:31.390 --> 20:33.830]  That was, that was wild.
[20:33.830 --> 20:36.670]  I'm so excited for next year's chair story.
[20:36.790 --> 20:38.270]  I can't, I don't know what's gonna happen.
[20:38.870 --> 20:40.010]  I don't want anymore chair stories.
[20:40.090 --> 20:40.910]  I have a question here.
[20:40.990 --> 20:44.590]  Gavin, are you saying that you've been using the same chair this entire,
[20:44.670 --> 20:45.490]  the entirety of this podcast?
[20:45.950 --> 20:46.310]  Yeah.
[20:46.870 --> 20:51.070]  Yeah, I got this chair in 2016, I think.
[20:51.430 --> 20:52.610]  How many chairs have you gone through?
[20:52.890 --> 20:53.930]  I'm on my third chair.
[20:54.670 --> 20:56.130]  He's on, Geoff's on the third chair.
[20:56.210 --> 20:56.510]  What about you?
[20:56.570 --> 20:59.430]  The others didn't break, but like, well, one of them broke.
[20:59.510 --> 21:00.470]  The first one was like half.
[21:00.470 --> 21:05.070]  You know how like, uh, like the hydraulics break on a chair and it won't stay up anymore.
[21:05.150 --> 21:06.410]  Just like slowly sinks down.
[21:06.530 --> 21:07.490]  I got rid of one of those.
[21:07.670 --> 21:09.710]  And then I got a second chair and it was just uncomfortable.
[21:09.710 --> 21:11.750]  So now I'm on my third, maybe my fourth chair.
[21:11.850 --> 21:15.950]  Honestly, I feel like, uh, I feel like it's a, this is a revolving chair podcast.
[21:16.210 --> 21:16.650]  It is.
[21:16.970 --> 21:18.590]  Yeah, that was, I didn't mention it either.
[21:18.670 --> 21:22.570]  That was one of my favorite things that broke on once I went into the Tony Hawk,
[21:22.630 --> 21:25.430]  like before that when it was really broken, but not fully dead.
[21:25.610 --> 21:27.230]  The hydraulics broke on it.
[21:27.230 --> 21:31.590]  So every time I'd get off of it, it would slowly raise to its highest point
[21:31.590 --> 21:33.930]  and it would shoot down whenever I'd sit on it.
[21:34.010 --> 21:34.790]  It was fantastic.
[21:35.450 --> 21:36.410]  It's a lot of fun.
[21:36.930 --> 21:38.130]  Sad that that chair's dead.
[21:39.090 --> 21:42.530]  I think we should get you a chair that will last.
[21:42.990 --> 21:44.050]  Maybe a custom chair.
[21:44.610 --> 21:47.150]  Uh, yeah, I'm not opposed to that idea at all.
[21:47.330 --> 21:48.810]  I'm fine with this chair right now.
[21:48.970 --> 21:50.550]  I'll get a year out of this ideally.
[21:50.830 --> 21:51.870]  And then maybe...
[21:51.870 --> 21:52.730]  So is this a new one you've got now?
[21:52.930 --> 21:53.770]  Yes, it is.
[21:53.810 --> 21:54.630]  Well, relatively now.
[21:54.630 --> 21:57.370]  I guess whenever the last one broke since that point.
[21:57.770 --> 22:00.810]  Yeah, there is something I want to talk about that you just reminded me of.
[22:01.170 --> 22:05.250]  I saw a thing I saw as it was posted, I believe, on the subreddit.
[22:05.550 --> 22:08.110]  There's a TikTok of a cup that got invented.
[22:08.550 --> 22:10.510]  They took some of the Gerpler technology.
[22:10.690 --> 22:10.890]  What?
[22:10.990 --> 22:11.650]  It's a real thing.
[22:12.410 --> 22:13.170]  I wish I could find...
[22:13.170 --> 22:17.530]  You know how in my design document, I pitched the idea of like a deck,
[22:17.890 --> 22:21.110]  a cards when you fan it out, like that would be the top that you close.
[22:21.410 --> 22:23.070]  There's a cup that does that.
[22:23.070 --> 22:24.650]  Let's see if I can find the post.
[22:25.150 --> 22:26.270]  Yeah, I need visuals.
[22:26.690 --> 22:30.130]  I'm confused if this is the thing that I came up with
[22:30.130 --> 22:33.270]  and someone else also came up with and created, or if I saw it before.
[22:33.610 --> 22:36.710]  I don't remember how I came to that point of designing the Gerpler.
[22:36.850 --> 22:38.210]  Let's see if it's on the subreddit.
[22:38.770 --> 22:40.190]  Or actually, I know where I could find it.
[22:40.470 --> 22:41.050]  But it's...
[22:41.050 --> 22:43.090]  If you remember, like my cup, ridiculous design.
[22:43.190 --> 22:43.810]  It had the parachute.
[22:44.110 --> 22:46.470]  It had the wings on the side of it.
[22:47.010 --> 22:48.030]  And wheels didn't it as well?
[22:48.290 --> 22:49.050]  It had wheels.
[22:49.150 --> 22:50.650]  Yeah, just so you want to slide it down.
[22:51.270 --> 22:56.350]  But one of the main points of design was I wanted a top that you could fan to close.
[22:56.490 --> 22:58.010]  So it could be open or close.
[22:58.230 --> 23:01.130]  So in the event that you're worried it would spill...
[23:02.270 --> 23:03.530]  One second here...
[23:06.710 --> 23:08.730]  Have you ever broken a chair, Gavin?
[23:09.490 --> 23:11.890]  Oh, I must have broken one at work at some point.
[23:12.150 --> 23:14.650]  I would imagine you've broken everything breakable at work.
[23:17.430 --> 23:19.070]  Well, I mean, Jeremy broke my desk.
[23:21.510 --> 23:22.270]  That's true.
[23:22.690 --> 23:24.710]  Hey, while you're looking for this, can I just say...
[23:25.650 --> 23:29.330]  On a whim, I looked on the store just before we started recording.
[23:29.490 --> 23:33.110]  Do you know what's what we still have more of that's still in stock?
[23:34.630 --> 23:35.330]  Grown tubes?
[23:35.550 --> 23:36.050]  Grown tubes.
[23:36.930 --> 23:43.130]  We have done a phenomenally piss poor job of telling you...
[23:43.130 --> 23:43.390]  Oh, terrible.
[23:43.950 --> 23:45.830]  ...that the grown tubes are in the store.
[23:46.050 --> 23:49.610]  I'm sure by the time you hear this, they'll be gone.
[23:49.610 --> 23:54.310]  But they've been in the store for like three weeks and nobody has cared or noticed.
[23:54.690 --> 23:56.170]  We haven't posted a single time.
[23:56.430 --> 23:59.250]  I think we might have posted once, like right when they hit.
[23:59.850 --> 24:02.830]  But we certainly haven't talked about it and promoted it like we do.
[24:03.270 --> 24:09.690]  Like, if we could sell a thousand bat knobs and a thousand pink port-a-potty tiki mugs,
[24:09.790 --> 24:10.870]  I would think we could sell...
[24:10.870 --> 24:18.190]  I think the grown tubes are arguably more desired than those other two items.
[24:18.190 --> 24:19.150]  And we just...
[24:20.930 --> 24:24.270]  We've had like 600 of them just like sitting there collecting dust and I just...
[24:24.270 --> 24:25.310]  I can't believe...
[24:25.850 --> 24:26.990]  I can't believe we've done...
[24:26.990 --> 24:28.270]  I'll take the blame for it.
[24:28.450 --> 24:29.210]  It's all my fault.
[24:29.470 --> 24:29.830]  Well, that's...
[24:29.830 --> 24:31.150]  I fucked up this...
[24:31.670 --> 24:37.510]  In my head, because they were at RTX and you could buy them at our convention,
[24:37.850 --> 24:39.790]  then they had already been out and they had already existed.
[24:39.930 --> 24:42.510]  And I just have not been able to flip that switch in my head.
[24:43.090 --> 24:43.970]  Well, it's been...
[24:43.970 --> 24:49.130]  It kind of came at an unfortunate time where they were available in our store
[24:49.570 --> 24:53.130]  around the same time we were filming Survive Block Island Meltdown.
[24:53.410 --> 24:55.610]  Yeah, so we're all busy doing something else.
[24:55.750 --> 24:56.890]  And then by the time...
[24:56.890 --> 25:00.530]  Like that was such an event to get through that by the time we finished that,
[25:00.590 --> 25:03.290]  it just sort of, I think, slipped all of our minds for different reasons.
[25:03.730 --> 25:07.990]  Yeah, I hope we do a better job with this round of baseballs because we put some work into them.
[25:08.270 --> 25:09.030]  I'm sure we will.
[25:09.130 --> 25:13.270]  And it sounds like all of the issues have been sorted out with the store as far as release time.
[25:13.270 --> 25:14.790]  Yes, I think so. I think so.
[25:14.810 --> 25:15.410]  Oh, cool. Here we go.
[25:15.970 --> 25:18.950]  Yeah, so here's the the cup. So you see it has a twist.
[25:18.950 --> 25:20.730]  Oh, it's like a sphincter lid.
[25:20.750 --> 25:23.430]  Oh, yeah, you twist it and you seal it.
[25:24.090 --> 25:26.110]  And it's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[25:26.770 --> 25:28.130]  Though that was part of my design.
[25:28.830 --> 25:31.070]  You get the fanning, you twist it, you could seal it.
[25:32.430 --> 25:33.910]  Andrew, you're brilliant.
[25:34.430 --> 25:38.090]  I think I might be a little like maybe 10% cup genius.
[25:39.430 --> 25:41.330]  I don't think the other things are practical.
[25:41.330 --> 25:43.370]  It fits on the straw.
[25:43.850 --> 25:45.190]  You could tighten the straw.
[25:45.350 --> 25:48.130]  Yeah, I mean, I didn't even... that's an innovation I did not consider.
[25:48.610 --> 25:55.210]  But it's weird to come up with something and then see it actually executed in a way
[25:55.210 --> 25:56.930]  that is better than you could have imagined.
[25:57.110 --> 25:58.750]  But it's still like the base idea is the same.
[25:59.230 --> 26:03.570]  I think you need to... do we still have access to online law firms?
[26:03.710 --> 26:07.710]  I think that we should hire a lawyer to sue the fuck out of TikTok.
[26:09.670 --> 26:10.850]  Sue TikTok for it.
[26:11.570 --> 26:12.730]  It's an old system.
[26:13.090 --> 26:15.090]  What has happened with the Gerpler?
[26:15.410 --> 26:17.150]  Have we sold those yet?
[26:17.570 --> 26:18.910]  Just talking about old stuff.
[26:19.190 --> 26:20.150]  I'm excited for that.
[26:20.530 --> 26:21.450]  We're getting them made.
[26:21.570 --> 26:22.130]  They're being made.
[26:22.210 --> 26:23.810]  I don't know what the status of them is.
[26:24.410 --> 26:28.870]  But I feel like it's just the same thing we always say, supply chain.
[26:29.250 --> 26:32.210]  You know, it's like shit's harder to get manufactured.
[26:33.030 --> 26:34.550]  But yeah, we're definitely making Gerplers.
[26:34.590 --> 26:39.670]  And I anticipate the Gerpler being hopefully the all-time like best received,
[26:39.670 --> 26:42.790]  best sold item the f***face has.
[26:42.870 --> 26:46.050]  Because I really do think that that's a pretty sweet spot, that Gerpler.
[26:46.510 --> 26:47.590]  I think it's too useful.
[26:51.710 --> 26:53.610]  We haven't got them in our hands yet, Kevin.
[26:53.930 --> 26:57.390]  I feel like f***face nails useless crap.
[26:57.810 --> 26:58.590]  Like a bat knob.
[26:59.090 --> 27:00.090]  What are you gonna do with that?
[27:00.830 --> 27:03.330]  What if we drill a hole in the bottom of every Gerpler?
[27:04.970 --> 27:07.250]  No, I'm excited about using the Gerpler.
[27:07.250 --> 27:10.570]  You have to pay a monthly subscription for the plug to seal the hole.
[27:11.430 --> 27:15.790]  I feel like it will be f***ed up in a way that we did not anticipate.
[27:16.270 --> 27:18.150]  I think that's locked in.
[27:18.450 --> 27:19.910]  Like there will be some issue with it.
[27:20.350 --> 27:23.110]  It'll be spelled right. It'll be like gruple or something.
[27:28.870 --> 27:32.370]  Well, just to round out baseballs, I just want to say I'm impressed, Geoff.
[27:32.530 --> 27:33.970]  You did a great job, it sounds like.
[27:34.170 --> 27:36.670]  I'm excited to see the products released.
[27:36.670 --> 27:41.030]  I honestly thought that you would have had a drop off because I've never done the baseball things.
[27:41.030 --> 27:45.790]  But as somebody who did burgers multiple times, every time I did burgers,
[27:45.790 --> 27:51.230]  I felt like I lost a little bit of myself and each attempt after was a step back
[27:51.230 --> 27:53.930]  or it was more of a struggle, even if I did better.
[27:54.070 --> 27:56.910]  Like it just was a more difficult thing to get through.
[27:56.970 --> 28:00.990]  So the fact that you have only improved in your hitting,
[28:01.350 --> 28:04.390]  even though your body is in a worse state, it's truly impressive.
[28:05.310 --> 28:07.230]  Well, thanks, man. And I appreciate it.
[28:07.330 --> 28:12.290]  I will admit that I was a bit afraid that I overperformed
[28:12.290 --> 28:16.430]  because it was in front of my girlfriend and her parents the first time, you know,
[28:16.470 --> 28:19.170]  which a lot of a lot of pressure.
[28:20.230 --> 28:23.150]  I could have like that could have like her parents could have walked away.
[28:23.210 --> 28:24.990]  I've been like, you you got to dump this dude.
[28:25.230 --> 28:29.730]  He's fucking he can't hit a 45 mile an hour ball to save his life.
[28:30.110 --> 28:31.970]  We had no beans waiting for us this time.
[28:32.090 --> 28:33.390]  Yeah, no beans this time either.
[28:33.390 --> 28:37.650]  So it was it was affirming to get the feeling that it wasn't beginner's luck.
[28:37.790 --> 28:39.010]  I appreciate that.

[33:00.530 --> 33:03.770]  Do you guys have anything else? Because I had one other thing.
[33:04.010 --> 33:06.510]  I have one small thing, but you can do yours first.
[33:06.550 --> 33:07.570]  No, you do your small thing.
[33:07.570 --> 33:11.510]  Well, okay. I just need to pull something for it, so if you want to go first.
[33:11.990 --> 33:22.170]  Okay. So, I feel like everybody was excited about... was really excited about the INCAP contest.
[33:22.910 --> 33:28.350]  And there was a lot of potential, a lot of possibility, and I thought it was a clever contest.
[33:29.510 --> 33:36.410]  And I feel like it had been a while since we'd had something like that, and I think maybe that's part of what was so exciting about it.
[33:36.910 --> 33:39.590]  Having a good old f*** face competition going on.
[33:39.710 --> 33:44.630]  And then it kind of fell flat because it turns out that Canada has wider INCAPs than aisles, right?
[33:44.850 --> 33:50.290]  Like, it would have been harder for you to eat off the aisles and ignore the INCAPs.
[33:51.530 --> 33:52.950]  Because all the useful shit is there.
[33:53.390 --> 33:53.530]  Yeah.
[33:53.650 --> 34:01.150]  Which also kind of makes sense if you think about it. You go into a grocery store, your INCAPs are where all the important shit is in Canada.
[34:01.210 --> 34:02.790]  You don't even have to go down the aisles, so f*** them.
[34:03.290 --> 34:04.830]  It's just where all the bad cereal is, I guess.
[34:05.590 --> 34:10.490]  But I want to... in the spirit of competition, I wanted to come up with something else that we could do.
[34:10.910 --> 34:15.170]  And I was having a conversation with Emily, and she reminded me of an...
[34:15.170 --> 34:26.590]  Actually, I was reminded of an old RVB bit, like a throwaway joke in RVB about Griff eating based on the alphabet.
[34:27.330 --> 34:34.810]  And then Emily was like, doesn't Andrew have that bingo thing on his desk?
[34:36.010 --> 34:38.090]  Do you still have the bingo machine where you can...
[34:38.090 --> 34:38.410]  I do.
[34:39.990 --> 34:45.370]  Here's what I propose. What if we did a contest, and it could be one of us, it could be all three of us.
[34:45.590 --> 34:46.930]  I like the idea of it not being me.
[34:47.890 --> 34:53.710]  Where we put 26 balls, numbered 1 through 26, into your bingo thing, and you pull one out.
[34:54.130 --> 34:57.910]  And whatever number you pull out, there's a letter associated with that number.
[34:58.550 --> 34:59.750]  A through Z, right?
[35:00.050 --> 35:04.270]  So you pull out the equivalent of the letter L.
[35:05.410 --> 35:09.830]  Now, for the next week, you can only eat food that begins with the letter L.
[35:11.530 --> 35:15.130]  Oh god, you could have some bad weeks. You could have a lot of baked ziti.
[35:15.230 --> 35:22.310]  So, what's the... the goal would be to go through all 26? So this would be a 26 week thing?
[35:22.590 --> 35:26.070]  No, the goal would just be... it's just a random way to pick a letter.
[35:26.470 --> 35:31.090]  So we could just potentially pick three numbers, and we'll each take one, and that's our food for the week.
[35:31.090 --> 35:34.930]  Yeah, potentially, like Gavin, you could get B, and you could be like, oh, it's burgers all week for Gavin.
[35:35.870 --> 35:37.430]  Oh, B would be the best.
[35:37.730 --> 35:40.910]  I could get X and have to re-pull because there's no food that's X.
[35:42.010 --> 35:47.110]  You know, you could get C and be like, I guess I'm eating a lot of coconuts and chicken, you know?
[35:47.670 --> 35:48.070]  Cheese.
[35:48.770 --> 35:51.250]  D, it's like... I hope I like dumplings.
[35:52.970 --> 35:56.130]  But you're confined to anything that starts with that letter.
[35:56.450 --> 35:59.230]  Okay, so let's do an important qualifier here.
[35:59.230 --> 36:04.690]  If I pull C, can I have grilled chicken, or is that a G?
[36:06.330 --> 36:07.950]  Yeah, I think C is chicken.
[36:08.770 --> 36:14.910]  Okay, so any variation of it. So if I had teriyaki chicken, that's still just chicken. The T doesn't matter.
[36:15.490 --> 36:15.670]  Yeah.
[36:16.090 --> 36:16.490]  Okay.
[36:16.610 --> 36:17.590]  Is that too easy there?
[36:18.810 --> 36:20.350]  If you get a C, it's pretty fucking easy.
[36:20.690 --> 36:22.450]  It is pretty easy. C is an easy one.
[36:23.050 --> 36:24.470]  What are you gonna do with an N?
[36:27.050 --> 36:28.270]  It's a lot of nigiri.
[36:29.650 --> 36:30.370]  What if...
[36:30.370 --> 36:32.310]  I think this is a fun idea.
[36:32.930 --> 36:33.650]  New potatoes.
[36:34.210 --> 36:35.570]  There you go. You can have...
[36:36.170 --> 36:37.750]  Yeah, sure. You can have nugs.
[36:39.990 --> 36:42.530]  I don't think you can. I don't think that counts.
[36:43.670 --> 36:50.730]  I really like this idea. I know you don't... you ideally didn't want to be involved with this, Geoff, but I think it would be fun if we each had to pull like four letters.
[36:50.730 --> 36:51.810]  No, I agree. I agree.
[36:52.810 --> 36:54.870]  What if we just do it for the weekend? This weekend?
[36:55.650 --> 36:58.090]  No, weekend is too easy. I think a full week.
[36:58.090 --> 37:02.210]  I think... and this is a thing that we could come back to in the future.
[37:02.370 --> 37:05.490]  Yeah, I think like the next time we record, we pull our numbers.
[37:05.990 --> 37:06.870]  I love that idea.
[37:06.930 --> 37:10.730]  And then between that recording and the next one, we show the pictures of all the food we ate.
[37:10.730 --> 37:12.110]  This is a fantastic idea.
[37:12.510 --> 37:12.690]  Yeah.
[37:13.110 --> 37:18.510]  Do we want to do a thing where we pick what letters are in the rotation? Each of us?
[37:18.510 --> 37:19.570]  I think it's got to be all of them.
[37:20.070 --> 37:26.310]  You want to put all the letters in? I'm just... I like the idea of potentially us picking like, oh, I really want P.
[37:26.310 --> 37:30.790]  Pizza. I could live off of pizza easily. That'd be a great letter to have.
[37:30.910 --> 37:34.130]  If I put it in wanting it for myself, but then Gavin pulls P.
[37:34.950 --> 37:42.410]  That's it. You're saying that we should have the ability to eliminate letters like all... like Rainbow Six Siege?
[37:42.790 --> 37:47.690]  Like you're like, no, nobody can play Tachanka this game. We voted against it.
[37:47.850 --> 37:50.650]  Yeah, like that kind of idea. Or it could just be all of them.
[37:50.810 --> 37:54.690]  I just think there's a lot of choice we can make as far as how we select these letters.
[37:54.690 --> 37:57.730]  And if we want... because nobody wants like an X.
[37:59.290 --> 38:03.610]  Yeah, apparently there's... I found a list of 19 foods to start with the letter X.
[38:03.930 --> 38:05.770]  Oh, well, there you go. What is one of them?
[38:05.970 --> 38:06.750]  Zalapa Punch.
[38:08.170 --> 38:08.690]  Okay.
[38:09.830 --> 38:12.410]  Xantham Gum. Oh, Xantham Gum, yeah.
[38:12.470 --> 38:13.070]  My favorite.
[38:13.970 --> 38:16.170]  Oh, Xavier Soup.
[38:16.610 --> 38:18.570]  Oh, I love an Xavier Soup.
[38:18.930 --> 38:21.170]  Soup combines dumplings with chicken stock.
[38:21.470 --> 38:23.570]  Making a hearty and simple meal. That's great.
[38:23.830 --> 38:24.290]  Yeah, that's great.
[38:24.290 --> 38:24.750]  Steak.
[38:24.910 --> 38:25.470]  What's that?
[38:25.710 --> 38:26.590]  Dumplings and steak.
[38:27.510 --> 38:31.190]  Steak topped with Worcestershire sauce, asparagus, spears, Swiss cheese, and olive oil.
[38:31.510 --> 38:34.310]  That's less appealing, but that might be okay.
[38:36.310 --> 38:38.750]  Uh, Xiamei? That sounds like a lot of Chinese food.
[38:39.110 --> 38:41.770]  Dried shrimp that have been sun-dried and shrunk to the size of a thumbnail.
[38:42.490 --> 38:45.190]  The shrimp are added to a variety of Asian dishes and... okay.
[38:45.810 --> 38:46.950]  There's some stuff out there.
[38:47.350 --> 38:51.030]  If we were able to do it, I'm gonna let you guys know now I'm banning like B or C.
[38:51.130 --> 38:53.630]  I'm gonna ban the most common letters if we do the banning.
[38:53.630 --> 38:55.810]  Otherwise, I say we just do the 26 letters.
[38:57.050 --> 38:57.090]  Okay.
[38:57.570 --> 39:02.430]  So do we want to do full alphabet, or do we want to do a thing where we pick letters to be in the hopper?
[39:02.810 --> 39:03.370]  I think full alphabet.
[39:03.950 --> 39:05.110]  I don't know. I have no idea.
[39:05.330 --> 39:06.270]  I think full alphabet.
[39:06.990 --> 39:07.450]  Full alphabet?
[39:07.650 --> 39:09.310]  How is this a food?
[39:10.090 --> 39:13.170]  Xylitol is a chemical compound used in many foods. Blah blah blah.
[39:13.790 --> 39:16.970]  It can be consumed by humans. It's highly toxic to dogs.
[39:17.390 --> 39:19.970]  You can't just have a cup of xylitol.
[39:20.910 --> 39:21.990]  Well, it sounds like you shouldn't.
[39:23.390 --> 39:24.490]  It sounds terrible.
[39:25.950 --> 39:28.910]  Well, let's just fucking pray nobody gets Z.
[39:29.510 --> 39:32.290]  Well, like, I don't even know, like foods that begin with U.
[39:32.610 --> 39:33.450]  What can you have?
[39:36.150 --> 39:39.470]  What about, so it has to be the food name. It can't be a restaurant, right?
[39:39.650 --> 39:42.830]  So if I thought of a U place, I couldn't eat anything from there.
[39:43.270 --> 39:43.370]  Unagi.
[39:44.390 --> 39:45.030]  Unagi's good.
[39:45.350 --> 39:48.370]  I mean, oh god, this is brutal.
[39:49.990 --> 39:51.150]  Does not get a U.
[39:55.510 --> 39:57.930]  You get to eat something called ugly fruit.
[40:00.270 --> 40:03.850]  I feel like we should have the whole alphabet in there and you get what you get.
[40:03.930 --> 40:05.350]  Some people might get very lucky.
[40:05.690 --> 40:13.710]  Now, OK, so a variation of this, because let's say, as I said, if I get P, I could easily eat pizza every day of every week.
[40:13.710 --> 40:15.530]  I could go a month on pizza. No problem.
[40:16.010 --> 40:16.110]  Yeah.
[40:16.670 --> 40:20.930]  Can you use, is there like a cap on how many days you can use a letter for?
[40:20.930 --> 40:26.130]  Like, if you put P down, is it worth two days of the week and then you have to switch to something else?
[40:26.710 --> 40:28.170]  No, I think that overcomplicates it.
[40:28.470 --> 40:30.990]  Well, we're drawing, I think it's already kind of complicated.
[40:31.390 --> 40:35.430]  Like, we're drawing balls for letters and, but that's fair.
[40:35.710 --> 40:41.610]  I just, I just feel like it'll be, because that was the problem with the end caps, is that it wasn't funny because it was easy.
[40:42.310 --> 40:46.410]  If we all have one easy letter, then I just feel like...
[40:46.410 --> 40:48.970]  That makes it funnier, though, if someone gets a B and someone gets a Q.
[40:50.190 --> 40:57.150]  Yeah, like if, if, if Gavin gets P for pizza and I get B for burgers and Andrew gets Q...
[40:57.150 --> 40:58.070]  And he's eating quince.
[40:59.370 --> 41:00.510]  Okay, well what about this?
[41:00.510 --> 41:01.230]  Quail eggs.
[41:01.430 --> 41:02.330]  Let's simplify this.
[41:02.790 --> 41:08.170]  You have to eat something that is from each letter. You have to use all your letters within the week.
[41:08.390 --> 41:08.770]  What do you mean?
[41:09.530 --> 41:12.150]  If we all, we're pulling three letters each, right?
[41:12.250 --> 41:13.470]  No, I thought we were only pulling one letter.
[41:13.630 --> 41:14.890]  Are we only pulling one letter?
[41:15.030 --> 41:17.730]  We're pulling three letters total. We each get one letter.
[41:17.730 --> 41:18.630]  Because there's three of us.
[41:18.630 --> 41:23.730]  I thought we were each pulling, that's where the confusion was. I thought we were each pulling three letters.
[41:25.030 --> 41:28.070]  Because when you said it was already confusing, I was like, I don't think it is.
[41:29.950 --> 41:38.590]  I had worked this a different, I thought we were going to pull like three letters each and then you'd have a choice between those letters each day of what you can use.
[41:39.390 --> 41:47.270]  See, because I thought it would be like a tension thing where, oh fuck, I pulled a Z in the first round, I'm begging for like a B, give me a C in round two.
[41:47.790 --> 41:51.210]  That's what I thought in my head. Not that we'd each only have one to work with. I got it.
[41:51.250 --> 41:52.990]  I think one is funny.
[41:53.550 --> 41:55.270]  I think one is funny too.
[41:55.610 --> 42:01.150]  By the way, this is so funny because I'm with Gavin, I'm like, is this complicated? I must be like a rocket scientist.
[42:01.950 --> 42:04.710]  26 numbers? 26 letters? What?
[42:05.250 --> 42:14.470]  No, it was not. I think I heard what you said created a completely different, more convoluted game in my head and then was continuing off of that premise.
[42:14.690 --> 42:15.930]  It's very straightforward what you're saying.
[42:16.810 --> 42:21.690]  So, we just have to apply, so will A be 1? 1A, 2B, 3C.
[42:22.110 --> 42:22.970]  I think like that, yeah.
[42:23.470 --> 42:23.910]  Got it.
[42:24.270 --> 42:25.150]  26 is Z.
[42:25.910 --> 42:27.650]  I'll get that set up for next time we record.
[42:27.830 --> 42:30.250]  And we'll use the English alphabet, that'll make the most sense.
[42:30.810 --> 42:31.050]  Yeah.
[42:31.670 --> 42:31.830]  Yeah.
[42:32.310 --> 42:42.850]  Can you guys think of an experience that was cool, but was completely lost on you? It would be cool to a lot of other people, but you were like the wrong person to experience it.
[42:43.130 --> 42:44.630]  Oh, I've probably had a lot of those.
[42:45.150 --> 42:46.730]  Yeah, I'm trying to think of...
[42:48.150 --> 42:55.270]  Like impressive, are you thinking like you went vacationing somewhere or you saw like some... I feel like it's landmarks.
[42:55.510 --> 43:02.330]  For me recently, I was just thinking, I was trying to remember like all the stuff I've done in the last 10 years, because I hit 10 years at Rooster Teeth.
[43:02.450 --> 43:04.150]  I was like, man, we've done a lot of stuff in that time.
[43:04.450 --> 43:09.350]  And like our MLB 2012 video, which was I think the first Let's Play I was in after I came back.
[43:10.330 --> 43:13.550]  I looked at it and it was, you know, 2 million views or something.
[43:13.650 --> 43:16.710]  It just literally said 10 years ago, like not nine.
[43:16.770 --> 43:18.370]  It was like passed over to 10.
[43:18.450 --> 43:19.750]  I was like, Jesus.
[43:20.270 --> 43:24.690]  I was thinking of some of the other stuff I did and looking back through my phone, I was like, oh, wow.
[43:24.730 --> 43:28.610]  Yeah, I went to a late night talk show.
[43:28.730 --> 43:33.730]  And I remember before, after I first moved here, I was watching more like talk show content.
[43:33.930 --> 43:35.330]  I'd see it pop up on YouTube more.
[43:35.410 --> 43:36.950]  I'd be like, and I was always confused.
[43:37.070 --> 43:39.270]  I always got Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel mixed up.
[43:39.350 --> 43:43.510]  And I just could never picture the right one in my head for the longest time.
[43:43.710 --> 43:50.650]  And then I remembered I went to the recording of one and I don't remember which Jimmy it was.
[43:53.810 --> 43:55.430]  And I know I've been to one.
[43:55.870 --> 43:57.830]  What are the names of the shows?
[43:57.970 --> 43:58.410]  The Late Show?
[43:58.770 --> 43:59.430]  What's the other one?
[44:00.090 --> 44:02.490]  I have no idea what their actual titles are.
[44:02.550 --> 44:08.410]  The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon or, I don't know, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, I think it was.
[44:08.410 --> 44:08.750]  Yeah.
[44:09.430 --> 44:14.050]  And I just remember thinking like, man, I used to get them mixed up and now I can picture them in my head better.
[44:14.270 --> 44:19.250]  But I know that I went to see a recording and I have absolutely no idea which one it was.
[44:19.450 --> 44:23.110]  And I'm just thinking like, that was an experience wasted on me.
[44:23.170 --> 44:26.330]  Like it was a cool experience, but I just took nothing away from it.
[44:26.410 --> 44:28.710]  Like I don't even know who I was seeing.
[44:28.910 --> 44:32.230]  And I was kind of embarrassed that I went and that's the experience I've come away with.
[44:32.290 --> 44:33.530]  Just wasted on me.
[44:35.230 --> 44:45.630]  I would wager that like half of the video game shit I've been to, like premieres or like launch events and stuff.
[44:45.670 --> 44:52.030]  It's just like, at some point they just kind of like, I don't know, they just kind of all are the same thing.
[44:52.190 --> 44:54.350]  And then you're like, this would probably be a really cool, like E3.
[44:54.810 --> 45:01.430]  Like after the second time you go to E3, you're like, man, this would be a lot of fun for somebody to come in my place who hasn't been before.
[45:01.430 --> 45:04.230]  Because it's already like wearing thin pretty quickly with me, you know?
[45:04.830 --> 45:14.390]  Yeah. And there's definitely been some experiences for me where my cool experience was like an introduction to that game or to that genre.
[45:14.710 --> 45:16.530]  And I'm not a fan of it at the time.
[45:16.630 --> 45:20.510]  And then because of that experience, I'll look into it and I'll get really into it.
[45:20.550 --> 45:24.050]  And I'll become a fan of the thing that I was at before I was a fan.
[45:24.090 --> 45:26.670]  And I'm like, damn, now I would ask all these different questions.
[45:27.290 --> 45:27.510]  Yeah.
[45:28.030 --> 45:29.810]  You've experienced stuff in the wrong order sometimes.
[45:29.810 --> 45:33.690]  I have that. I have that with bands a lot. Or I used to. I don't go to shows anymore.
[45:33.810 --> 45:37.890]  But I would like see a band and not know who they were or have heard of them, but not be into them.
[45:37.970 --> 45:42.010]  Like there's this band I really like now. One of my favorite bands in my life, this band called Hot Water Music.
[45:42.370 --> 45:55.010]  And I saw them play live. And the lead singer got, well, there's two lead singers, but one of them got so fucking drunk three songs in that he had to sit on the ground and prop himself up on a like a pole to continue singing.
[45:55.090 --> 45:58.110]  And I was like, this is fucking dog shit. And these guys suck.
[45:58.110 --> 46:03.950]  And then six months later, I was the biggest fan of that band ever. And there's been a lot of a lot of those.
[46:04.050 --> 46:08.890]  It's like, I wish I could see them again and know the lyrics to the songs and appreciate them, you know?
[46:11.010 --> 46:20.760]  Yeah. I'm sure I've had a lot of those. Nothing comes to mind. I've had times where maybe I didn't understand the value of the experience.
[46:21.490 --> 46:22.170]  Yeah, exactly.
[46:22.170 --> 46:28.210]  So like I had one where it was back when I was just doing Achievement Hunter stuff behind the scenes.
[46:28.350 --> 46:38.270]  I went through a phase where I was trying to get early game copies for The Office and I had developed a contact at Sony and kind of became friends with them.
[46:38.490 --> 46:41.950]  Like very that's friends is a strong word, but we communicated and was friendly.
[46:42.230 --> 46:51.190]  And then I got an email randomly saying that I was invited to PlayStation's behind the scenes E3 showcase that year.
[46:51.190 --> 46:54.890]  And I had no plans on going to E3. It was back when Rooster Teeth would go to E3.
[46:55.290 --> 47:00.030]  And so I forwarded it, forwarded it to Trevor, I believe. I don't remember who I sent.
[47:00.330 --> 47:05.330]  I sent to someone who's like, hey, I got invited to this thing. Do you want like, do we want to cover this?
[47:05.430 --> 47:09.790]  Does somebody in The Office want to go in my place? Because we have an invite. I just can't. I'm obviously not going.
[47:10.150 --> 47:12.170]  And it was like, yeah, sure. Well, we can reach out to them.
[47:12.270 --> 47:18.590]  So then I emailed the PR person back at Sony and the vibe I got was very much like, no, we don't just give these away.
[47:18.590 --> 47:28.450]  We can't just, no, you can't just give your invite to somebody else. Like, I think they took it as like this very prestigious, like exciting thing to be part of that you would see these games.
[47:28.590 --> 47:34.610]  And so for me to write back, cool, can I give this to somebody else? They were not thrilled with that response.
[47:34.830 --> 47:42.570]  And I never got a reply back on. It was essentially just, yeah, we do not like we're going to have to talk about if we're OK with this.
[47:42.570 --> 47:49.430]  And I never heard past that point. But that is an experience where I just I thought it was like sort of an open invite type thing.
[47:49.530 --> 47:52.590]  And I think it was more behind closed doors than I realized.
[47:52.950 --> 47:57.410]  Companies that value themselves very highly are incredibly easy to piss off.
[47:58.070 --> 47:58.370]  Yes.
[48:03.570 --> 48:10.790]  That is very true. I have pissed off a few companies in my day. Yeah, that's that's definitely true.
[48:10.790 --> 48:17.690]  Hey, I realized something that we didn't talk about yet that we probably should fucking talk about. It just completely slipped my mind.
[48:18.330 --> 48:24.350]  We had our first office day. Oh, yeah, we did. We had an office day. I forgot to mention that.
[48:24.590 --> 48:33.630]  And it was wildly successful, I thought. I thought it was a lot of fun. I didn't really honestly know what to expect going into it.
[48:33.670 --> 48:40.010]  I'm excited for the next one because I feel like I have a better idea for it and I can plan more accordingly.
[48:40.790 --> 48:45.630]  Yeah, so the way it worked is we, you know, I had this idea. I presented it to y'all. Y'all loved it.
[48:45.690 --> 48:54.110]  Eric took it to Face Jam, another podcast on our network. They did it first and then bragged constantly about how successful it was and how they came up with a bunch of new shows.
[48:54.770 --> 48:59.510]  And so, but what I thought put a lot of pressure on us. Oh, definitely. A hundred percent.
[48:59.890 --> 49:06.830]  And I'm sure nobody else on Earth felt the pressure but us, the three of us. And probably Gavin didn't feel it at all, but I certainly did.
[49:06.830 --> 49:14.650]  Like these motherfuckers took our idea and they're gonna do it better than us. Now we gotta outperform. I just think you're a cooler customer. I don't think you're affected by stuff.
[49:15.170 --> 49:19.510]  I'm so nervous about the show. Did I tell you about the freakout I had a couple of weeks ago?
[49:20.030 --> 49:20.270]  No.
[49:20.890 --> 49:31.310]  You know like when you have a little bit of anxiety and you wake up from something that usually you'd be able to fall back asleep to, but instead your brain just starts thinking in insane loops?
[49:31.310 --> 49:39.650]  I woke up extremely worried about how I couldn't put my finger on the fact that this show, I couldn't, I couldn't figure out why this show works.
[49:41.730 --> 49:46.990]  I was like, we're making it and it's good. And I don't know how we're doing it.
[49:48.330 --> 50:03.230]  I was just freaking out because I couldn't put it into words. Like what's working about it? Like what are the pitfalls to avoid? Like when is it going to become shit and like people don't like it anymore? I can't believe it's still alright. I was just freaking out.
[50:04.010 --> 50:25.670]  Oh man. Well, I love how passionate you are about this, this show. And, um, I, uh, I share your trepidation and your fears. I've constantly, I'm nervous about, about, uh, it really does feel like somehow we captured lightning in a bottle. And I honestly, it's best just not to think about it.
[50:25.670 --> 50:39.210]  If at all possible. But to go back to, I certainly wasn't trying to insult you in any way that you don't care about. I just feel like you're, you're just a cooler customer. You're more unflappable, you know, like you're harder to get under your skin about this kind of stuff.
[50:39.210 --> 51:02.950]  You know what it felt like to meet Geoff? What's that with the Eric thing in the face? It would be like if we had just invented basketball and he immediately showed us Steph Curry. It's like, we just had this basic idea of how this could work and that it might be beneficial and immediate. Like, Oh yeah, no, we did amazing. We did all these amazing things. He's like, yeah, I really liked it. The whole idea where you put the ball in the basket. Here's a windmill dunk.
[51:04.710 --> 51:07.350]  Meanwhile, we're trying to staple the hoop to the backboard.
[51:10.090 --> 51:12.430]  How do you make a ball out of paper?
[51:14.390 --> 51:26.650]  So, but let's run through it. So we had it and I felt very good about it. We agreed to be at work at a certain time and then we zoomed in. Andrew, I got there a little early. I grabbed a whiteboard.
[51:27.350 --> 51:36.630]  And first off, by the way, there was some subtle whiteboard aggression going on that I feel like I got a call out.
[51:37.070 --> 51:39.530]  You talked about it in Sausage Talk.
[51:40.370 --> 51:46.310]  Oh yeah, well, never mind. I won't talk about it because you'll have to listen to Sausage Talk. We should probably talk about what that is.
[51:47.110 --> 51:59.030]  So grabbed the whiteboard, wrote down a bunch of ideas for like merch and thought starters and just like directions we want to go. Things that are like dangling, shit that's dangling out there that we need to like tie a bow on and figure out.
[51:59.290 --> 52:12.430]  And then everybody came in and we sat around. Well, first off, Gavin showed up a little later. Eric and Andrew and I had the funniest conversation I've ever had. I don't remember what it was, but I just remember thinking like we got to stop talking because this is immediately content.
[52:12.430 --> 52:26.190]  I remember what it is. I actually have it in my notes for a thing to talk about because it's a topic that I've had. You and Eric unknowingly put a whole different angle on a thought I previously had that I've talked to Gavin about.
[52:26.670 --> 52:39.390]  I feel like being able to see a place, and this kind of sounds counterproductive, but being able to see a place makes me want to visit it more than if we were in a time period in which that thing would just have to be described.
[52:39.850 --> 52:54.750]  And my example of this is, you know that place in Greece where it's like all the white houses and like the blue roofs? Yeah, like to see that visually beautiful. If you met somebody who traveled all that way, let's say they had to like take a boat, like this is planes maybe not around.
[52:55.410 --> 53:05.770]  In a world in which travel is difficult, they went there, came back and tried to explain why you needed to go. There's no way they could sell me on it. White houses and blue roofs, I could do that.
[53:05.770 --> 53:20.290]  I could just paint my house that way. There's nothing impressive about that. So it made me wonder how far would I be willing to travel for something like that? And honestly, probably not more than four blocks. I wouldn't go further. It's going to take a lot.
[53:20.690 --> 53:27.490]  If you just describe a landmark to me, it's going to be very difficult for me to be willing to leave my city to see it.
[53:30.830 --> 53:47.270]  When Geoff and I were in Belgium, we went through an alleyway that was the best smelling alleyway we'd ever smelled. Probably some waffles. This is like an old story from the old podcast. How far would you travel to smell the best alleyway that you've ever smelled?
[53:48.750 --> 54:03.050]  I've had some pretty good smells in my life. No, I don't know about that. Food is definitely more of a needle mover for me. 100%. But I'm thinking it smells pretty goddamn good outside my hubby's bagel sometimes. I don't feel like I'm needing that.
[54:03.050 --> 54:04.490]  You got good smells.
[54:04.610 --> 54:06.690]  I feel like I got good smells in my area.
[54:06.870 --> 54:09.470]  I'm telling you, this would blow it out of the water.
[54:09.470 --> 54:26.490]  Yeah, he's not kidding, dude. I still think about it sometimes. Without hyperbole. It was unreal. It might have been the most satisfied I've ever been in my life in a moment.
[54:26.490 --> 54:44.970]  It was in that alleyway, just looking left and looking right, and it smelled just as good in both directions. And I can't even put into words the smell of this old world mixed with waffle mixed with whatever the fuck else is in Belgium. I would fly there again just to go to that alleyway.
[54:45.010 --> 54:47.130]  I feel like my heart could smell it.
[54:47.570 --> 54:53.250]  Yeah, you weren't even smelling it with your nose, right? You were smelling it with your spirit.
[54:55.990 --> 54:58.590]  So has that moved the needle beyond four blocks for you?
[54:58.770 --> 55:08.890]  I would go to the next town over to smell that alleyway. I'm not leaving my province or state, but I would go one town over for that. That sounds pretty good.
[55:10.030 --> 55:13.290]  You're also a person who doesn't like going downstairs, so I feel like that's pretty good.
[55:13.290 --> 55:20.610]  Well, not necessarily. I'm open to it. I just need an experience that moves me. That sounds moving. I could go there.
[55:22.530 --> 55:31.270]  Also, you're creating an additional hurdle. Once I get past the stairs, I'm willing to go wherever. It's just that you need to convince me to go through the stairs.
[55:31.270 --> 55:44.610]  No, I'll go way beyond that. But what got it changed, what I had never considered, and this is what was so fucking funny. I don't remember what it was called, but Eric was showing Geoff what these... it was like a type of long dog.
[55:44.890 --> 55:47.810]  It was a dog breed that is especially long.
[55:47.850 --> 55:48.770]  Eric loves those.
[55:49.550 --> 55:57.350]  He's a big fan of the long dogs. And it turned into a conversation of like, what if your point of reference for animals was very simplistic?
[55:57.350 --> 56:03.610]  And seeing a giraffe and being like, you would not believe the fucking dog I saw. It was so goddamn long.
[56:03.610 --> 56:05.510]  You would not believe the neck on this horse.
[56:06.370 --> 56:18.890]  I would travel the globe if somebody described to me an animal that they encountered that I could see. If they were like, you will not believe this fucking horse, and it's a giraffe, I'm all in about that. That moves me. I'd travel wherever for that.
[56:18.890 --> 56:26.850]  That's what it was. Eric just tried to describe, like, how to describe an elephant to somebody who's never heard of or seen an elephant before. You're like, no, trust me. It's as big as a house.
[56:27.510 --> 56:38.870]  And it's nose touches the ground. And it's ears, it's ears are like, it's ears the size of three men standing next to each other. And you'd be like, you're fucking crazy. That doesn't exist.
[56:38.870 --> 56:56.270]  Andrew, how far would you travel for, to see a chair? There was an animal that looked exactly like a wooden chair. Imagine like the first, the cheapest chair in the Sims, but it was like a sentient creature. How would you, how far would you go to see that? Walking around, eating.
[56:56.730 --> 57:06.450]  Oh, I'm, we're going on a boat. I don't care if we go across the globe. I'm getting on a boat for that. I will go to a different part of the world to see the chair animal. A hundred percent.
[57:07.970 --> 57:19.530]  I will be so mad. The entire time I'm on the boat, I'll be like, Jim better not have fucking lied about what this animal is. I'm going to be so goddamn mad. I make it to Ireland and there's no goddamn chair animals.
[57:19.530 --> 57:42.070]  Well, I think that the fear we had on that office day morning, that what we were creating was content, uh, was founded because this was clearly content. Uh, about, I went, we just say like a half an hour into the thing, we decided just to record, uh, what we were talking about and in kind of in the spirit of, uh, Eric's, Eric's job.
[57:42.570 --> 57:58.090]  Yeah. That we made where it was just Eric trying to schedule us for 26 minutes. So we recorded about an hour and 15 minutes of us just like office talk and, uh, we called it, uh, we decided that like, this is either going to be episode the next episode of fuck face or it's going to be its own show.
[57:58.490 --> 58:16.610]  Uh, I think it was different enough to be its own show, but we, uh, we described it as like a peer behind the veil or like getting to see how the sausage is made. And then Gavin didn't understand that reference. So it became sausage talk. And so I think we've got a new show coming out at some point called sausage talk.
[58:16.610 --> 58:37.090]  That's just us talking about like, I guess the behind the scenes shit. Yeah. It's, it's a weird thing. Cause I don't think it was necessarily all that funny, but I think it's an interesting insight into it's also the very first production meeting we've ever had for face anything. Yes. Kind of fun that that was recorded.
[58:37.090 --> 58:59.990]  We didn't want it to be an episode of fuck face just cause we got the disadvantage of we're all in the same room except for Andrew. Yeah. I remember going home from that and remembering the name sausage talk. And I was trying to remember the phrase that it came from. Cause I kept forgetting it. And I was like, what was it? It's like peek behind the sausage. I just couldn't remember. I was like, should I apply sausage to all these? Like you'd have to move a sausage to see what was under it.
[59:02.590 --> 59:17.250]  So anyway, I don't know when it's coming out. It may already be out. It may be out before this episode, but there is supplemental content either the just hit or that's coming called sausage talk. I guess we'll record one every office day. So once a month, so there'll be 12 of those a year.
[59:17.250 --> 59:34.870]  Unless we're using office day for something like the pizza video or or hitting baseballs or whatever, or like or MVP, which is coming, I think, next week. Oh, no, it's not because it was meant to be. It was meant to be tomorrow. But then we realized that big Uno stream is tomorrow. Yeah.
[59:36.930 --> 59:57.890]  So also, we promised at some point in space that y'all would do a like your recap of your experience of survive Black Island together. And so after we filmed sausage talk, episode one, volume one, year one, we filmed that. And I'll say no more about that other than it was. I think it went about five minutes.
[59:58.230 --> 01:00:17.310]  Was that interesting at all? Because I felt very in my own head about that. I wasn't sure if I was clear at all. I think convoluted that. No, no, I think it is. And I think Eric felt it was very interesting. And I think because I asked him the same question, because you and I like the three of us were like involved in the production. So we were pretty in the weeds with it. And you it's kind of hard.
[01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:32.910]  We were pretty we were deep in the sausage. We were we were we were knee deep in the sausage weeds. And Eric assured me that it was pretty good. I do think that we wrapped it up at about the right time. I do feel like it if it had gone much longer, it would have it would have started to drag.
[01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:41.970]  I feel like it is one of the few things we've made as this face team where it wouldn't stand alone as a piece of content like you actually need to have seen. Yes.
[01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:54.250]  Survive Block Island, I think. And if you listen to it, every every second of that series will be spoiled. So make sure you watch it first if you have any interest in watching it. Yeah, I only have one regret from that recording.
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:01:12.610]  There's one thing I should have brought up that I completely forgot about, but maybe we'll talk about that later. Talk about the next sausage. You could do it. You could do an add on. We'll pick up. I don't think it's worth it's like a weird. It's weird that we didn't mention it, but not worth it being an add on. I'll talk to you about it after we record. All right.
[01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:21.390]  All right. Speaking of, should we stop? Yeah, I guess we should wrap up. This is fun. This is a really relaxed, nice hour. It's really great catching up with the two of you.
[01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:41.010]  Eric got off lightly by not being here because, unfortunately, didn't want it to happen. Extra Medium was going to come up again based on some stuff I've read in the comments of this podcast. So thanks to all the comment leavers who have filled me in over something he was saying on Face Jam. And we will be taking that up with him.
[01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:52.970]  Dude, I'm excited because I have no idea what it is, but I do know that Eric is fucking over the Extra Medium talk, which only makes me want to dive deeper into it.
[01:01:53.410 --> 01:02:01.570]  Oh, it's so good. And I guess this will be the last one of these we record for because we're not doing next week. Right. But we'll do the following week. Yeah, I believe that's correct.
[01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:20.690]  And we'll probably do two, I imagine. I assume so. Love you both dearly. Gavin, have a fantastic vacation. Andrew, I hope you don't have to travel as far as four blocks if you don't want to. And we'll see you guys next time on F*** Face. Bye.
[01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:30.950]  That felt weird. The bye felt weird. That was a weird bye. That was a weird bye. Gavin typically goes bye. And then I think to myself, I should say bye, but I never say anything.
[01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:42.170]  You said bye as if you were just sitting down in a lounger. It sounded guttural to me. It was low. It was guttural. You're right. I'm going to just shut up.
[01:02:42.170 --> 01:03:02.790]  It's like, here's what that bye was. Your dad goes to work all day long. He works in a factory. He comes home. He's no f***ing fun at the end of the day. He sits down. He's eating his dinner. And your mom is like, I'm going to go play bingo or with my friends. And he's like, bye. And he raises his hand like, I don't give a f***, get out. I'm so f***ing done with these people.
[01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:15.910]  I would apply that to something like, remember Geoff, when we would record an entire let's play and then the power would go out and we'd lose every single piece of footage and then we'd have to sit down again to record it immediately. It was a bye from that sort of mindset.
[01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:19.930]  Can I try it again? Can I try to do a different, a proper Gavin bye?
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.690]  Yeah, let's have a redemption. In the moment redemption.
[01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.030]  Why are you making this about me?
[01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:27.570]  Because you have a very distinctive bye. I'm going to try to hit it.
[01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.650]  By the way, you're very self-conscious this episode, buddy.
[01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.810]  I went too defensive.
[01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.450]  Well, you stepped over Gavin's laugh. Try it again.
[01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.890]  Bye!
[01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.310]  Is that a little loud? Is that good?
[01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.650]  I'll be honest, because of Discord, I'm only hearing, aye.
[01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:43.950]  Yeah, the beginning is getting cut off.
[01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.570]  Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit and then I'm going to immediately transition. Bye!
[01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.650]  Well, that sounds like...
[01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:55.230]  That is like you're crossing the road and a car has come up the curve a little bit and you're like, oh!
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.690]  And then it goes very fast and all you can hear is, bye!
[01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.950]  I give up. I surrender.
[01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:05.770]  Goodbye!
[01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:08.610]  Stop, dude! Don't do it that way. It's weird.
[01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.450]  It's creeping me out. Bye bye!
[01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.930]  Bye!
[01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.370]  Now that was a weird one.
[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:14.930]  Really?
[01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:15.690]  Who is?
[01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:17.610]  No. It's fine.
[01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:22.230]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:26.510]  Once again, the guys couldn't be bothered to record an episode, so here are some predictions.
[01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.410]  The hockey teeth are fixed!
[01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:30.010]  Where did we put the tuxedo?
[01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:32.430]  Geoff hurt himself whacking balls.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.030]  Gavin isn't here anymore.
[01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.430]  Hinton is well on his way to half a million.
[01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:37.710]  Eric is flustered.
[01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:40.590]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:43.690]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
