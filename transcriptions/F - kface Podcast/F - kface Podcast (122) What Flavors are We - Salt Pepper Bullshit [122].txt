[00:15.090 --> 00:19.250]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:20.010 --> 00:24.590]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always, Andrew Panton from Canada.
[00:24.790 --> 00:28.590]  Gavin Free from England via America.
[00:29.710 --> 00:35.250]  And this is episode something, volume something or other, year whatever.
[00:36.170 --> 00:38.530]  Oh, it's back. We did it.
[00:38.970 --> 00:39.910]  Whatever the f*** it is.
[00:39.910 --> 00:43.230]  Episode 122, year something, volume something else.
[00:44.210 --> 00:45.830]  And hello boys.
[00:46.330 --> 00:46.610]  Hi.
[00:47.510 --> 00:47.690]  Hi.
[00:47.750 --> 00:49.830]  Look at that, we both did it. Successfully.
[00:50.190 --> 00:50.590]  That was smooth.
[00:50.590 --> 00:52.270]  We got a lot to talk about today.
[00:53.030 --> 00:53.470]  It's been a while.
[00:53.950 --> 00:54.990]  I wrote notes. It's been a minute.
[00:55.350 --> 00:57.150]  So I'm just gonna burn through some of these motes.
[00:57.910 --> 01:03.710]  I'm gonna burn through some of these notes because it's like housekeeping shit.
[01:03.830 --> 01:05.090]  Number one thing we should cover.
[01:05.090 --> 01:07.690]  Well, we should be clear though, this isn't monkey boarding.
[01:08.130 --> 01:10.750]  No, no, we'll get there. It's number four on the list.
[01:11.170 --> 01:11.610]  Okay.
[01:12.250 --> 01:14.110]  And it was never monkey boarding, it was monkey lunch.
[01:14.310 --> 01:14.750]  But anyway.
[01:14.810 --> 01:15.210]  Oh, sorry.
[01:15.950 --> 01:19.430]  Monkey boarding, that was a previous iteration of this video.
[01:20.090 --> 01:22.710]  Okay, right out of the gate, we talked about it last week.
[01:23.630 --> 01:24.890]  I think we even put some photos up.
[01:25.250 --> 01:26.790]  The baseballs are coming out.
[01:26.910 --> 01:35.250]  The pre-hit, autographed, in-paint, f*** face, second round of baseballs, hit by me, signed by me,
[01:35.250 --> 01:43.810]  is releasing on the Rooster Teeth website on 12 Central PM, September 30th.
[01:43.850 --> 01:47.910]  So that's Friday, September 30th at 12 noon Central Time.
[01:48.070 --> 01:49.730]  Prepare to be pissed off.
[01:50.010 --> 01:52.510]  Prepare to be pissed off.
[01:53.030 --> 01:56.750]  I believe there are about 200 and some change.
[01:57.090 --> 01:57.990]  I think it's 205.
[01:58.670 --> 01:59.610]  205, okay.
[01:59.890 --> 02:04.010]  So we got 205 baseballs, so there you go.
[02:04.010 --> 02:06.810]  If you want one, that's how you get one.
[02:07.230 --> 02:12.850]  Go to the Rooster Teeth store, roosterteeth.com, and be there.
[02:13.150 --> 02:14.950]  I don't know, get there at 11.58, get there a little early.
[02:15.290 --> 02:15.850]  You never know.
[02:16.370 --> 02:19.410]  Well, they're gonna be sold out by 11.55, so why are we even...
[02:19.410 --> 02:22.070]  No, no, I've been assured.
[02:22.350 --> 02:23.530]  We have this fixed.
[02:23.830 --> 02:25.170]  It will go on sale on time.
[02:25.610 --> 02:29.370]  If you go to the site and you mark the thing like, hey, let me know when this is back,
[02:29.430 --> 02:31.370]  it'll send you a direct link, it'll be the fastest way you can do it.
[02:31.390 --> 02:32.070]  There's no way that will work.
[02:32.430 --> 02:32.890]  You're welcome.
[02:33.630 --> 02:34.150]  Wow.
[02:34.690 --> 02:36.730]  Can we please bet some whether it all falls apart?
[02:37.390 --> 02:37.910]  Sure.
[02:38.430 --> 02:39.330]  Yeah, I'm gonna bet it.
[02:39.390 --> 02:40.910]  I bet it goes smoothly.
[02:41.290 --> 02:42.630]  Yeah, I think it goes smoothly as well.
[02:43.170 --> 02:43.830]  I bet it doesn't.
[02:44.310 --> 02:47.030]  It fucking better go smoothly.
[02:49.210 --> 02:49.730]  Alright.
[02:51.710 --> 02:54.090]  Okay, next piece of house cleaning.
[02:54.450 --> 02:58.570]  When we ended the last episode, we were very excited to jump into this one,
[02:58.570 --> 03:03.950]  because we were gonna hammer out the rules and get started on our alphabet food challenge.
[03:04.250 --> 03:07.550]  However, and we'll get into this a little bit later as well,
[03:07.630 --> 03:09.210]  because we're supposed to be doing the monkey movie right now.
[03:10.470 --> 03:12.110]  We're having to do back-to-backs today,
[03:12.670 --> 03:16.750]  so it would make no sense for us to develop the rules and get it all squared away,
[03:17.130 --> 03:20.150]  and then immediately go into another recording where we can't talk about it.
[03:20.290 --> 03:23.310]  So we'll handle all of that in episode 123.
[03:23.630 --> 03:24.170]  I apologize.
[03:24.610 --> 03:27.570]  I think you were probably expecting it in 122, because I'm pretty sure we...
[03:27.570 --> 03:29.650]  Oh, we definitely said we'd start next time.
[03:29.650 --> 03:32.030]  That it would 100% start in episode 122.
[03:32.190 --> 03:34.950]  But just because of logistically, I think it would be way...
[03:34.950 --> 03:38.210]  It would fuck you guys and us way harder to figure it all out this week,
[03:38.230 --> 03:42.910]  and then have a whole episode that we don't discuss it at all, and then go into it.
[03:42.950 --> 03:46.030]  So we'll just skip any alphabet conversations,
[03:46.590 --> 03:50.510]  and push those to the recording that we're gonna do immediately after this one ends.
[03:50.970 --> 03:51.870]  If everybody's okay with that.
[03:52.130 --> 03:52.190]  Alright.
[03:52.270 --> 03:52.790]  Yeah, that's fine.
[03:52.790 --> 03:57.590]  So are we gonna start then on the Monday, next Monday, with that?
[03:58.070 --> 03:59.030]  For us, not them.
[04:00.430 --> 04:01.910]  We'll discuss that next episode.
[04:02.110 --> 04:02.350]  Okay.
[04:02.790 --> 04:04.670]  Andrew really wants it to happen in this episode.
[04:04.830 --> 04:06.990]  Yeah, I don't know the answer, but I know...
[04:06.990 --> 04:08.190]  But I don't want to talk about it right now.
[04:08.210 --> 04:09.090]  I just said a little bit of...
[04:09.090 --> 04:11.030]  Because there's no such thing as a question.
[04:11.690 --> 04:13.110]  You'll open a can of worms.
[04:14.130 --> 04:14.850]  It's brutal.
[04:16.830 --> 04:18.290]  We'll get into this next episode too,
[04:18.330 --> 04:20.750]  but I just had what I thought was a simple dinner with Eric the other night,
[04:20.750 --> 04:22.510]  and it turned contentious quickly.
[04:23.590 --> 04:24.070]  Oh wow.
[04:24.410 --> 04:26.490]  So I don't even want to cover the alphabet.
[04:26.930 --> 04:28.730]  What can we talk about this episode?
[04:28.990 --> 04:31.870]  Well, I'll tell you the number one thing I'd like to talk about
[04:31.870 --> 04:35.670]  is why we're not filming a goddamn monkey movie again!
[04:38.570 --> 04:41.630]  This is so fucking ludicrous.
[04:42.290 --> 04:43.770]  I was trying to figure it out.
[04:43.770 --> 04:52.070]  I think each of us have now been responsible for pushing the MVP2 recording at least twice.
[04:52.630 --> 04:53.890]  That was my first push, I think.
[04:54.270 --> 04:55.090]  I think it was your second.
[04:56.190 --> 04:57.730]  I'm not sure about that.
[04:57.890 --> 04:59.470]  Andrew definitely shoved it a couple...
[04:59.470 --> 04:59.990]  I did one.
[05:00.130 --> 05:00.950]  No, I've shoved it.
[05:01.310 --> 05:02.710]  Okay, you know, fuck you, Gavin.
[05:03.550 --> 05:04.670]  No, I've done it once.
[05:04.990 --> 05:05.850]  I've had one shuffle.
[05:06.270 --> 05:07.470]  I think everybody's done it.
[05:07.590 --> 05:09.190]  I think everybody's done it a hundred times.
[05:09.570 --> 05:10.470]  Gavin, you motherfucker.
[05:10.470 --> 05:13.770]  Now you're the reason we're not filming the monkey movie right now.
[05:13.850 --> 05:15.330]  I hope you enjoyed your vacation.
[05:15.630 --> 05:16.510]  It was lovely.
[05:16.790 --> 05:22.670]  I realized that the time I landed was exactly the time that monkey lunch started.
[05:22.910 --> 05:23.370]  Or monkey movie.
[05:24.290 --> 05:27.350]  So I'd say British Airways, 50% to blame.
[05:28.490 --> 05:29.270]  Goddamn, dude.
[05:29.630 --> 05:34.930]  So the current plan is that we film the monkey movie next week, I think?
[05:34.970 --> 05:35.450]  Is that right, Alex?
[05:35.450 --> 05:35.790]  Yes.
[05:36.750 --> 05:37.070]  Friday.
[05:37.350 --> 05:38.970]  The exact same time as now.
[05:38.970 --> 05:41.970]  Yeah, so it is on the calendar next Friday.
[05:42.210 --> 05:44.370]  Well, that means nothing. It was on the calendar for this week, too.
[05:44.370 --> 05:46.650]  I 100% agree with you, but it's still on the calendar.
[05:47.370 --> 05:54.570]  Usually whenever I have to move something or if I'm going to be late or miss a podcast, Eric's like, no problem, sort it out.
[05:54.710 --> 05:57.030]  Eric's response this time was, Jesus Christ.
[06:00.550 --> 06:03.250]  I'm just, I'm so disgusted by all of us.
[06:03.530 --> 06:04.930]  I can't, I have zero.
[06:04.930 --> 06:10.170]  You want to talk about a bet? Let's place a bet on whether we film the monkey movie next week or not. How about that?
[06:10.870 --> 06:14.670]  I feel way more, no, not way more, I feel equally confident on both those things.
[06:15.010 --> 06:19.170]  I also like that you're leading this charge. I feel like you've pushed the monkey movie the most, Geoff.
[06:19.430 --> 06:23.090]  I think I have, too, but now I'm telling you, everybody has pushed the monkey movie.
[06:23.290 --> 06:24.490]  Oh, I agree, totally.
[06:24.710 --> 06:27.750]  I only pushed f***face. I didn't push the monkey movie.
[06:27.910 --> 06:32.210]  So I don't think I could even take, all I did yesterday was land at the time we were recording f***face.
[06:32.210 --> 06:36.850]  No, you pushed the monkey movie by virtue of you having to push f***face.
[06:37.890 --> 06:38.090]  Yeah.
[06:38.890 --> 06:39.370]  Priorities.
[06:40.030 --> 06:42.550]  It's absolutely dominoes and you set them off.
[06:43.150 --> 06:44.330]  That's a great way to put it.
[06:44.730 --> 06:48.550]  Nick is changing opinions like the wind right now in the Discord.
[06:48.970 --> 06:52.410]  Nick says, that's true, and then below it, that's also true.
[06:54.550 --> 07:03.230]  Well, I will say that the monkey movie being pushed, I think ultimately is a good thing because it has given me more time to put together my presentation.
[07:03.230 --> 07:06.130]  How much time do you need for your PowerPoint? You've had a year.
[07:06.590 --> 07:08.070]  This is what I'm going to get into, Gavin.
[07:08.510 --> 07:17.170]  I was always very much a leave the homework until the night before type of guy, and that has continued with MVP.
[07:18.610 --> 07:27.490]  So I've been starting. I started it assuming we would be doing it today, and I realized I need way more time to do this right.
[07:27.610 --> 07:31.450]  I could have put something together, but to make it truly right, I needed more time.
[07:31.810 --> 07:36.990]  I rewatched the entire film. I got my screen grabs. I got everything kind of organized already.
[07:37.390 --> 07:40.350]  How many screen grabs would you two guess that I pulled?
[07:40.490 --> 07:40.750]  From MVP 1?
[07:40.970 --> 07:44.210]  On my first viewing. From MVP 1 to do this presentation.
[07:44.250 --> 07:44.970]  I would guess...
[07:44.970 --> 07:47.330]  And it's in, let's say, like, 86 minute movie.
[07:47.330 --> 07:50.150]  I would guess for a solid presentation, at least 20.
[07:51.450 --> 07:53.270]  At least 20. What about you, Geoff?
[07:53.990 --> 08:00.690]  God, what's... it's either comically high or comically low. 20 feels like a pretty safe... I'm going to say 4.
[08:01.330 --> 08:02.330]  You're going to say 4?
[08:02.690 --> 08:03.870]  Yeah, I'm going to go the other way.
[08:04.990 --> 08:11.730]  Before we had a merch meeting yesterday, and before we started it, I said to Eric, I've captured way too many images for this thing.
[08:11.730 --> 08:17.570]  I probably have like a hundred. So then I highlighted them all to get a specific number. I clicked and dragged.
[08:18.270 --> 08:24.130]  I ended up with 227 screen captures for an 86 minute movie.
[08:24.790 --> 08:26.750]  That's like half the frames in the movie.
[08:26.790 --> 08:30.730]  You have to talk about one every 20 seconds and it would be longer than the movie.
[08:32.050 --> 08:33.450]  That's what I said.
[08:34.410 --> 08:42.290]  I said to Eric, at this point, I just want to do one of those stick man drawings where you rapidly spin it and it moves for you.
[08:42.370 --> 08:44.810]  Like you're just seeing a physical version of the film.
[08:45.670 --> 08:49.930]  I edited it down. I reduced it. I went through all of it last night.
[08:50.130 --> 08:53.790]  I got my kind of final cut. I feel there might be one more minor edit.
[08:54.150 --> 08:56.670]  How many images do you think we ended up with, with the final edit?
[08:57.890 --> 08:58.330]  120.
[08:59.130 --> 08:59.570]  120.
[08:59.570 --> 09:00.430]  150.
[09:00.790 --> 09:07.770]  Geoff is very close. 144. We got 144 images to convey the story of MVP.
[09:08.270 --> 09:10.590]  Do you think that might be too long?
[09:10.950 --> 09:15.110]  No, honestly, I think I may have cut out some aspects of it.
[09:15.270 --> 09:18.890]  It was also interesting because I did it in chronological order.
[09:19.170 --> 09:22.810]  Like I'd watch the movie and be like, oh, this is a plot point. I'm going to capture this.
[09:22.970 --> 09:27.750]  And then realizing like, oh, there's like three or four storylines that they start and just never finish.
[09:27.750 --> 09:31.590]  They have no conclusion. So like, I don't need any of it. We just pretend it doesn't happen.
[09:31.750 --> 09:34.470]  I think I don't cover two or three of the hockey games.
[09:36.410 --> 09:40.610]  I cut where I could. But there's a core to this story that needs to be told.
[09:41.290 --> 09:43.830]  So how long is your presentation going to be, do you think?
[09:45.150 --> 09:50.230]  I don't know. I'm going to try to keep it under 10 minutes would be my goal.
[09:50.610 --> 09:53.830]  And we're recording that as well, right? For release?
[09:53.830 --> 10:02.070]  I believe so. Yeah, I think that would be the beginning of the monkey lunch recording, I assumed would be the presentation being displayed.
[10:02.610 --> 10:04.570]  That's great. What are you guys going to eat for lunch?
[10:04.850 --> 10:05.730]  A monkey lunch?
[10:06.190 --> 10:06.430]  No.
[10:07.030 --> 10:12.790]  That's tough because bananas, obviously a go-to in that scenario, but I don't do that.
[10:13.030 --> 10:14.910]  I'm off bananas. I'm a little bit stopped up.
[10:15.230 --> 10:16.490]  Yeah? What happened?
[10:17.210 --> 10:18.390]  I'm just not pooing.
[10:18.390 --> 10:25.030]  Really? But didn't you just go on vacation outside of America? Don't you poo better outside of America?
[10:25.390 --> 10:32.790]  I'll be honest. Right now, I've got food from Italy, England and Texas in me at the same time.
[10:33.190 --> 10:33.830]  Oh, God.
[10:34.470 --> 10:35.790]  Not super comfortable.
[10:36.310 --> 10:39.790]  Are you okay? Are you dealing with, is your stomach sore?
[10:40.450 --> 10:43.650]  Yeah, I feel like someone's inflated a balloon in my gut.
[10:44.290 --> 10:48.390]  There's definitely movement, like it's slowly working its way towards the doors.
[10:48.770 --> 10:56.310]  Have you attempted to use the sleep apnea machine to fill yourself with air to maybe push what's stuck through?
[10:56.790 --> 10:58.470]  Yeah, almost like you're plungering yourself.
[10:58.770 --> 11:01.810]  I would be genuinely worried that my stomach would explode.
[11:03.730 --> 11:12.010]  I was going to go the medicine route, but I like Andrew's idea of repurposing everyday items to solve this problem.
[11:13.290 --> 11:17.470]  I made a mistake. I've never felt more human than I have this morning.
[11:17.710 --> 11:18.410]  That is a mistake.
[11:18.630 --> 11:21.870]  Yeah, it doesn't happen often. My burger confidence is gone.
[11:22.370 --> 11:28.710]  I don't think I've ever felt more like Icarus than when you wake up with heartburn.
[11:29.050 --> 11:34.910]  I woke up at 6.30am. I couldn't sleep last night. I was up a little bit later than I'd want to be.
[11:35.370 --> 11:40.730]  And I was like, I'll have a little snack before bed. So I had two or three pieces of garlic toast and some garlic bread.
[11:40.730 --> 11:42.990]  It was great. I had a great time.
[11:43.150 --> 11:47.850]  Woke up at 6.30am feeling like there was a volcano in my chest. It was just terrible.
[11:48.210 --> 11:54.130]  Terrible heartburn. No tums. No tombs. Nothing in sight. Nothing I could do to relieve it.
[11:54.370 --> 11:56.430]  Just sitting there. I've never felt more human.
[11:56.970 --> 12:00.470]  My wings were seared. My burger confidence was gone. It's terrible.
[12:01.150 --> 12:04.250]  So you don't feel human when both of your ankles are snapped?
[12:05.710 --> 12:08.930]  No, that's just like an alternate form. I guess. I don't know.
[12:10.170 --> 12:17.510]  Eight of the months of the year, you're on the injury report with an ankle injury. That's normal.
[12:18.470 --> 12:23.950]  I'd argue the months that I'm not hurt, that's like I'm in super form. That is beyond.
[12:24.690 --> 12:27.570]  That is another level of burger confidence existence.
[12:27.830 --> 12:31.150]  So broken is the standard. Broken is the standard.
[12:31.730 --> 12:33.050]  So what caused the heartburn?
[12:33.970 --> 12:37.330]  Garlic bread. And then immediately went to sleep.
[12:37.330 --> 12:39.410]  So garlic bread will do it to you, huh?
[12:39.730 --> 12:43.910]  I guess for me, yeah. I feel like that's something that has changed over time.
[12:44.210 --> 12:47.090]  Red wine gets me. Really? That's an interesting one.
[12:48.810 --> 12:52.530]  Gavin, can you look back to one meal you think that stopped you up?
[12:52.910 --> 12:56.010]  What do you think did the worst damage to you?
[12:56.310 --> 13:01.570]  I always get wrecked by seafood, so I'm going to say it was the six giant king prawns I had.
[13:03.030 --> 13:06.510]  That sounds good. Did you make a condiment sauce to go with them?
[13:06.510 --> 13:08.370]  No, I didn't.
[13:11.830 --> 13:14.330]  A bit of lemon. Lemon's great.
[13:14.570 --> 13:17.110]  Eric says peanut butter. Peanut butter backs up Eric.
[13:17.910 --> 13:21.550]  Does that give you heartburn or does that stop you up?
[13:21.890 --> 13:24.690]  It's heartburn. And only sometimes. And I don't know why.
[13:24.950 --> 13:29.490]  Because I'll eat peanut butter, but then there are times where I have peanut butter otherwise and it's like, oh no.
[13:29.770 --> 13:32.610]  And I'm just like an alien, spitting acid.
[13:33.470 --> 13:35.750]  Could it be what you're pairing it with?
[13:35.750 --> 13:37.090]  Or is it just the peanut butter?
[13:37.130 --> 13:39.510]  No, it's like a spoonful of peanut butter.
[13:39.710 --> 13:40.070]  Interesting.
[13:41.150 --> 13:45.010]  I don't think I have a peanut allergy because I eat peanut butter sometimes and it's fine.
[13:45.130 --> 13:52.250]  I just think that there's just something sometimes where something gets caught or hits something wrong and all of a sudden I get all fucked up.
[13:52.470 --> 13:56.790]  Do you ever eat peanuts? Like Cracker Jacks or just honey roasted peanuts?
[13:57.150 --> 14:02.110]  Yeah, typically when you take me out to the ballgame, I'll have some peanuts.
[14:02.110 --> 14:05.630]  Other than that, I think peanuts are pretty bottom tier.
[14:06.410 --> 14:06.850]  Whoa!
[14:09.110 --> 14:09.990]  Oh, fuck.
[14:11.190 --> 14:13.690]  No, Geoff, continue. We don't need to get into the peanuts.
[14:14.490 --> 14:16.430]  Oh, I know I'm right. It's fine.
[14:17.170 --> 14:20.030]  They're a staple nut, but they're not a great nut.
[14:20.210 --> 14:21.470]  I agree. 100% agree.
[14:21.890 --> 14:24.130]  The peanuts are the nut.
[14:24.630 --> 14:26.010]  No, they're not.
[14:26.710 --> 14:29.050]  Geoff, it might be time to grow up and get past peanuts.
[14:29.510 --> 14:31.230]  They're the number one nut in the world.
[14:31.770 --> 14:35.930]  Yeah, I don't think that's wrong, but they're not the best tasting.
[14:36.350 --> 14:39.470]  You can coat them in so many different things. It's a great base nut.
[14:40.010 --> 14:42.590]  Yeah, you can't coat any other nut with any other thing.
[14:42.830 --> 14:50.450]  You know what you can't do with other nuts? I just bought a bunch of peanuts to boil yesterday. I'm gonna boil peanuts this weekend.
[14:50.530 --> 14:51.290]  Oh, that's disgusting.
[14:51.590 --> 14:53.850]  Yeah, that's absolutely vile.
[14:54.270 --> 14:55.470]  So delicious. Gavin's had them before.
[14:55.470 --> 14:56.330]  They're actually pretty good.
[14:56.570 --> 14:58.750]  Geoff made them and they were great.
[14:58.750 --> 14:59.590]  A bit weird.
[14:59.810 --> 15:02.190]  Boiled peanuts, man. It's a southern delicacy.
[15:02.390 --> 15:03.430]  I'm open to it.
[15:03.970 --> 15:08.110]  I don't think there's anything wrong. I think we would agree that peanuts are like the coke of nuts.
[15:08.390 --> 15:09.990]  Yeah, they're the coke of nuts.
[15:10.590 --> 15:12.490]  I just don't think that they're the best tasting.
[15:12.870 --> 15:14.630]  I didn't say that they were the best tasting.
[15:14.870 --> 15:17.690]  That's what I think we're clear. That's the issue I think we're having.
[15:17.690 --> 15:19.750]  Well, why don't we all say the best tasting nut on three?
[15:20.370 --> 15:20.670]  Okay.
[15:21.110 --> 15:22.210]  Ooh, that's tough.
[15:23.530 --> 15:24.750]  Count us down.
[15:25.850 --> 15:27.170]  We'll do three, two, one, go.
[15:28.390 --> 15:28.910]  Okay.
[15:29.630 --> 15:31.450]  Three, two, one.
[15:31.750 --> 15:32.150]  Cashew.
[15:34.930 --> 15:36.530]  Cashew is the worst nut.
[15:36.930 --> 15:37.270]  What?
[15:38.970 --> 15:39.990]  Hang on.
[15:40.510 --> 15:41.430]  That's a terrible taste.
[15:41.450 --> 15:43.270]  Get fucked. Are you kidding me?
[15:44.710 --> 15:46.010]  Macadamia nuts are way better.
[15:46.290 --> 15:47.310]  Pistachios are way better.
[15:47.830 --> 15:48.470]  That's a great nut.
[15:48.790 --> 15:50.990]  I think you're ridiculous calling cashew a terrible nut.
[15:51.330 --> 15:53.270]  I was considering pistachio.
[15:53.630 --> 15:54.670]  I love a pistachio.
[15:54.670 --> 15:57.770]  The problem with pistachios is you'll get one in every 87.
[15:59.470 --> 16:00.510]  That is just awful.
[16:00.710 --> 16:01.050]  That's true.
[16:01.550 --> 16:02.790]  That's the issue with pistachios.
[16:02.810 --> 16:04.150]  That's a lot of work.
[16:05.010 --> 16:05.590]  That's true.
[16:06.150 --> 16:07.890]  You just buy them at the store.
[16:08.510 --> 16:11.670]  I get spicy pistachios that are already shelled.
[16:12.450 --> 16:13.110]  And they're fucking awesome.
[16:14.290 --> 16:15.890]  I do agree with you, Andrew.
[16:15.950 --> 16:19.150]  I feel like there has to be one pistachio in every bag.
[16:19.250 --> 16:19.490]  Yes.
[16:19.490 --> 16:22.670]  Or a bunch of pistachios that absorbs all the bad in it.
[16:22.690 --> 16:24.510]  And it just becomes the doo-doo pistachio.
[16:24.510 --> 16:26.210]  And it takes all the bad flavor away from the others.
[16:26.510 --> 16:27.670]  It's like the cursed pistachio.
[16:29.270 --> 16:32.090]  Speaking of curses, that's another thing we should talk about at some point today.
[16:33.210 --> 16:36.110]  But listen, I don't want to turn this into an indictment of nuts.
[16:36.390 --> 16:37.910]  I don't want to get into a whole nut fight.
[16:38.010 --> 16:40.750]  I feel like we've got so much other food stuff to be angry at each other about.
[16:41.390 --> 16:42.410]  Or to argue about.
[16:43.550 --> 16:44.710]  But I do have a question.
[16:45.030 --> 16:46.670]  Do you guys talk about heartburn like you have it a lot?
[16:46.870 --> 16:49.990]  Is heartburn a relatively common thing for y'all?
[16:50.390 --> 16:50.690]  No.
[16:51.490 --> 16:52.570]  Very rare for me.
[16:52.690 --> 16:55.790]  I remember really wanting heartburn as a kid.
[16:56.330 --> 16:58.450]  Because then I could use Gaviscon.
[16:59.750 --> 17:00.990]  What is Gaviscon?
[17:01.150 --> 17:02.210]  It's a heartburn medicine.
[17:04.870 --> 17:06.430]  Why did... I don't understand.
[17:06.490 --> 17:07.090]  Because of the name.
[17:07.510 --> 17:09.130]  It's got my entire name in it. It's awesome.
[17:10.790 --> 17:13.650]  I mean, this was a realization I had at the age of about six.
[17:14.150 --> 17:14.510]  Okay.
[17:14.830 --> 17:16.130]  I saw that immediately.
[17:16.790 --> 17:18.110]  I just don't understand.
[17:18.110 --> 17:21.670]  I guess where my disconnect is, is why does using it make it cooler?
[17:21.810 --> 17:24.130]  I feel like the fact that it exists is the cool thing.
[17:24.250 --> 17:25.690]  I think I just wanted to have some.
[17:25.810 --> 17:29.530]  Because there's a medicine out there that if you take three letters away, it says Gavin.
[17:29.790 --> 17:30.690]  No, I get it.
[17:31.010 --> 17:32.010]  Take out the sco.
[17:33.630 --> 17:34.410]  I get it.
[17:34.830 --> 17:36.350]  I just don't think that makes it cooler.
[17:36.770 --> 17:38.230]  But at six years old, I probably would.
[17:38.550 --> 17:44.350]  I used to have heartburn and acid reflux every day of my life.
[17:45.070 --> 17:45.210]  Really?
[17:45.650 --> 17:46.010]  Yeah.
[17:46.290 --> 17:47.950]  For probably 15 years.
[17:48.350 --> 17:50.010]  And then I quit drinking and it went away.
[17:50.110 --> 17:52.830]  And I don't know that I've had heartburn since I quit drinking alcohol.
[17:53.010 --> 17:53.210]  Wow.
[17:53.670 --> 17:55.070]  It was just something I knew.
[17:55.150 --> 17:56.610]  And I knew that was what it was.
[17:56.730 --> 17:59.690]  It was pretty hard not to understand what I was doing.
[18:00.510 --> 18:01.850]  But yeah, that's why I asked.
[18:01.950 --> 18:04.950]  I forgot about heartburn until this conversation.
[18:05.090 --> 18:07.250]  Because it just hasn't been an issue since I quit drinking.
[18:07.850 --> 18:08.990]  Wow. That's awesome.
[18:09.950 --> 18:10.190]  Yeah.
[18:10.370 --> 18:11.790]  Sorry to hear you guys are still plagued by it.
[18:11.790 --> 18:13.250]  I got it from drinking.
[18:14.150 --> 18:14.710]  I think I'm alright.
[18:16.410 --> 18:16.850]  Gaviscon.
[18:17.010 --> 18:18.450]  Have you ever had Gaviscon?
[18:19.010 --> 18:20.110]  Did that dream ever happen?
[18:20.850 --> 18:22.950]  I still don't think I've ever had it.
[18:24.570 --> 18:26.590]  Let me ask you a question.
[18:27.590 --> 18:29.570]  You posted a picture of Gaviscon.
[18:29.730 --> 18:30.890]  And it says it's mint flavored.
[18:31.090 --> 18:32.810]  I assume that's the standard flavor.
[18:33.490 --> 18:36.030]  What flavor would you attribute to Gaviscon?
[18:36.050 --> 18:38.730]  If you had to pick a signature flavor for a caffeine.
[18:38.910 --> 18:40.470]  If you were a medicine.
[18:40.470 --> 18:42.410]  What flavor do you come in?
[18:43.690 --> 18:45.370]  Are we all going to make answers?
[18:45.630 --> 18:47.190]  Do you want Gaviscon to have an answer?
[18:49.650 --> 18:51.070]  I would, in my head.
[18:51.550 --> 18:52.770]  I don't know why this is.
[18:52.890 --> 18:54.190]  I'm going to have to decode this myself.
[18:54.330 --> 18:56.710]  I immediately went to some combination.
[18:57.050 --> 18:58.330]  Of like a fruit.
[18:58.490 --> 18:59.270]  Like a berry.
[18:59.690 --> 19:00.990]  With black licorice.
[19:01.570 --> 19:03.590]  That's the flavor profile that I'm getting.
[19:03.870 --> 19:04.810]  I think that's quite flattering.
[19:05.470 --> 19:06.230]  I'll take that.
[19:07.810 --> 19:09.190]  Yeah, that is really good.
[19:09.210 --> 19:10.350]  I like black licorice, dude.
[19:11.650 --> 19:13.630]  I would take you as medicine.
[19:14.030 --> 19:14.430]  Instantly.
[19:15.030 --> 19:16.850]  Somebody who rates cashews the number one.
[19:16.970 --> 19:18.150]  Or the least number one.
[19:18.330 --> 19:19.630]  I'm sorry.
[19:21.770 --> 19:22.670]  The least number one.
[19:22.910 --> 19:24.010]  When you get them on the airplane.
[19:24.350 --> 19:26.010]  Throw those on the floor, dude.
[19:27.490 --> 19:28.790]  It's a waste of a nut.
[19:28.850 --> 19:30.030]  It's a waste of itself.
[19:31.390 --> 19:33.430]  Yeah, it's a pointless.
[19:35.010 --> 19:35.830]  How about you, Gav?
[19:35.830 --> 19:37.750]  Do you think you're mint flavored?
[19:38.930 --> 19:40.570]  I don't even know if I can answer.
[19:40.890 --> 19:42.030]  I don't know why.
[19:42.130 --> 19:43.390]  I think I'm too close to it.
[19:43.750 --> 19:47.270]  I think you're tomato based.
[19:48.370 --> 19:49.870]  Oh, I can see that.
[19:50.990 --> 19:51.810]  That's interesting.
[19:51.970 --> 19:52.990]  A tomato based... yeah.
[19:53.550 --> 19:54.470]  I could see that.
[19:54.990 --> 19:56.910]  I would have said maybe some sort of oil.
[19:58.470 --> 19:59.210]  Like olive oil?
[19:59.210 --> 19:59.850]  What type of oil?
[19:59.950 --> 20:00.550]  Like olive oil.
[20:00.550 --> 20:03.510]  I see that feels a little too fancy to me.
[20:04.590 --> 20:06.310]  Olive oil is extravagant.
[20:06.730 --> 20:09.090]  Eric, what flavor are you?
[20:09.270 --> 20:12.150]  What flavor do I think I am or Gavin is?
[20:12.270 --> 20:12.650]  No, you.
[20:12.790 --> 20:13.330]  What flavor are you?
[20:14.050 --> 20:16.730]  I think Gavin is that bubblegum flavor that you get.
[20:17.010 --> 20:17.990]  See? There you go.
[20:18.150 --> 20:19.990]  Nick is saying that he's bubblegum.
[20:20.150 --> 20:20.990]  I could see that too.
[20:21.150 --> 20:26.130]  I associate Gavin with that bubblegum flavor that you get with some medicines when you're a kid.
[20:27.570 --> 20:29.650]  I think I'm like a NyQuil flavor.
[20:30.110 --> 20:31.970]  Like, you know when you take NyQuil and you go,
[20:32.090 --> 20:34.550]  this is absolutely vile, but boy it really helps you out?
[20:34.690 --> 20:36.110]  I feel like that's sort of...
[20:36.110 --> 20:39.170]  You're maybe NyQuil with an ashtray poured in it.
[20:42.350 --> 20:45.570]  Has someone been ashing their cigarettes in my NyQuil?
[20:45.690 --> 20:46.890]  Oh well, I'm going to bed.
[20:53.610 --> 20:54.490]  Ashtray NyQuil.
[20:58.190 --> 20:59.590]  What about you, Geoff?
[21:00.990 --> 21:01.870]  Oh, uh...
[21:01.870 --> 21:02.670]  I hadn't thought about me.
[21:03.130 --> 21:05.050]  I think you've got like a salt flavor to you.
[21:05.330 --> 21:06.190]  I think I'm like...
[21:06.190 --> 21:08.470]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[21:08.570 --> 21:10.370]  My wife just texted me and said cinnamon.
[21:11.150 --> 21:13.030]  Did you ask her what flavor you are?
[21:13.030 --> 21:16.310]  No, she's just in another room and she just texted me cinnamon.
[21:19.770 --> 21:21.850]  I think I'm jalapeno flavored.
[21:22.590 --> 21:23.710]  I think I'm like, I'm spicy.
[21:25.450 --> 21:27.530]  Just like some generic spice.
[21:27.530 --> 21:29.470]  Yeah, I can see that.
[21:30.750 --> 21:34.170]  You like it at first, but then you get too much of it quickly and then you regret it.
[21:34.230 --> 21:34.930]  I feel like that's me.
[21:35.370 --> 21:37.770]  See, I think you're jalapeno flavor or like
[21:37.770 --> 21:40.030]  when something like a fast food restaurant
[21:40.030 --> 21:41.870]  goes like, this is our new spicy burger
[21:41.870 --> 21:44.350]  and then you eat it and you go, this is not...
[21:44.930 --> 21:46.890]  This thing thinks it's really spicy,
[21:47.030 --> 21:48.410]  but this is not as spicy
[21:48.410 --> 21:50.150]  as it thinks that it is.
[21:50.310 --> 21:52.290]  It's like how people outside of Texas
[21:52.290 --> 21:53.970]  think Chipotle has spice.
[21:54.530 --> 21:55.990]  It's like when you went to Nando's
[21:55.990 --> 21:57.430]  and got the spiciest chicken.
[22:02.990 --> 22:04.510]  I would say Andrew's
[22:05.170 --> 22:05.950]  flavor would be
[22:06.510 --> 22:08.650]  the plate at the end of
[22:08.650 --> 22:09.990]  a stack of pancakes.
[22:10.690 --> 22:11.150]  Oh.
[22:12.150 --> 22:12.990]  So like
[22:14.630 --> 22:16.070]  maple-ish.
[22:16.770 --> 22:18.550]  Yeah, like syrup flavor with
[22:18.550 --> 22:20.610]  butter, pancake bomb
[22:20.610 --> 22:21.270]  stuck to it.
[22:21.810 --> 22:24.190]  How do you take your pancakes, Andrew?
[22:24.530 --> 22:26.390]  Typically just some butter.
[22:26.770 --> 22:28.290]  I'm not a big syrup guy.
[22:28.390 --> 22:30.610]  Just like a slice of butter on top and just let it melt
[22:30.610 --> 22:32.210]  into the pancake when it's hot kind of thing?
[22:32.450 --> 22:34.550]  Eh, just a little bit of butter on top.
[22:34.830 --> 22:36.470]  So you're like a dry pancake person?
[22:36.730 --> 22:37.630]  I guess, yeah.
[22:38.110 --> 22:39.970]  I mean, I need some butter on it.
[22:39.970 --> 22:41.530]  It can't be completely dry, but...
[22:41.530 --> 22:44.230]  I think that's so gross. My daughter does the same thing. It drives me nuts.
[22:44.810 --> 22:46.210]  It's syrup. It's just like fucking
[22:46.850 --> 22:47.630]  sugar, man.
[22:48.050 --> 22:50.190]  Yeah, it's a moisture to it.
[22:51.150 --> 22:51.890]  I don't understand.
[22:52.290 --> 22:54.150]  Are you like syrup? You need a lot of syrup
[22:54.150 --> 22:55.070]  on your pancakes?
[22:55.850 --> 22:58.330]  Yeah. I would say butter makes it wetter
[22:58.330 --> 23:00.030]  than syrup. Fruit or whatever.
[23:00.790 --> 23:02.470]  That's an interesting...
[23:02.470 --> 23:04.390]  I don't think butter makes it wetter
[23:04.390 --> 23:06.650]  than syrup. Why would you...
[23:06.650 --> 23:07.850]  Because syrup is more viscous.
[23:08.030 --> 23:09.950]  It doesn't feel as wet as opposed to like
[23:10.530 --> 23:12.090]  clogged. I also feel like it
[23:12.090 --> 23:13.730]  exists... I don't know.
[23:14.310 --> 23:16.290]  This could be wrong because I don't use syrup frequently.
[23:16.610 --> 23:18.110]  I feel like syrup kind of exists
[23:18.110 --> 23:20.090]  on top of the pancake and doesn't
[23:20.090 --> 23:22.090]  integrate into the pancake like butter
[23:22.090 --> 23:24.070]  does. It's almost like they're two separate
[23:24.070 --> 23:25.650]  entities that you're eating at the same time.
[23:26.130 --> 23:27.650]  I don't think they mix.
[23:28.730 --> 23:29.830]  Syrup and a pancake.
[23:30.190 --> 23:31.290]  I will say that
[23:33.430 --> 23:34.230]  butter goes
[23:34.230 --> 23:35.970]  further than syrup on a
[23:35.970 --> 23:37.990]  pancake. Like if you put a pat of
[23:37.990 --> 23:39.990]  butter on it and then it like melts into
[23:39.990 --> 23:42.090]  the pancake, you still get a lot
[23:42.090 --> 23:43.970]  of the butter flavor. But I feel like syrup,
[23:44.010 --> 23:45.910]  you gotta constantly keep pouring it on because
[23:45.910 --> 23:48.010]  as soon as it dissipates
[23:48.010 --> 23:49.950]  into the pancake, it just like...
[23:49.950 --> 23:51.730]  the flavor's lost. It like disappears.
[23:52.110 --> 23:53.630]  Where was pancakes on your list, Geoff?
[23:53.830 --> 23:55.810]  On my list of what? Oh, it's not even on my list.
[23:56.010 --> 23:56.290]  Sorry.
[23:57.730 --> 23:59.950]  But now we're talking about pancakes. What type of syrup
[23:59.950 --> 24:01.710]  do you like, Geoff? Oh, uh...
[24:01.710 --> 24:03.950]  I like Mrs. Butterworth's or Log
[24:03.950 --> 24:05.570]  Cabin or like whatever.
[24:05.950 --> 24:06.790]  I just like syrup. Are those maple?
[24:07.470 --> 24:08.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
[24:09.670 --> 24:11.850]  I'll take any kind of syrup. Any kind of sugary syrup.
[24:11.970 --> 24:13.510]  I don't care. I'm not particular.
[24:15.330 --> 24:16.050]  To my
[24:16.050 --> 24:17.670]  knowledge, there is no cashew
[24:17.670 --> 24:19.630]  of syrup. They're all
[24:19.630 --> 24:21.490]  at a level above
[24:21.490 --> 24:22.910]  the sugar's nut. Oh, I agree.
[24:23.650 --> 24:25.770]  Yeah, there's definitely no standard
[24:25.770 --> 24:27.690]  for that. You've got tons of great choices.
[24:33.500 --> 24:34.580]  Now a word from our
[24:34.580 --> 24:35.620]  sponsor, BetterHelp.
[24:36.340 --> 24:38.340]  I've had times in my life where I've been
[24:38.340 --> 24:40.660]  trying to problem solve so many different
[24:40.660 --> 24:42.620]  issues at once. It just
[24:42.620 --> 24:44.580]  is completely overwhelming to take on
[24:44.580 --> 24:46.720]  by yourself. Even things
[24:46.720 --> 24:48.540]  that you may typically be able to sort through
[24:49.100 --> 24:50.460]  individually. It can just be
[24:50.460 --> 24:52.520]  overwhelming doing so many things.
[24:52.620 --> 24:54.380]  And sometimes you just have issues that occur
[24:54.380 --> 24:56.440]  that you can't
[24:56.440 --> 24:58.480]  seem to figure out a solution for.
[24:58.860 --> 25:00.460]  It can be tough to train your brain
[25:00.460 --> 25:02.560]  to stay in problem solving mode when faced with
[25:02.560 --> 25:04.620]  a challenge in life. But when you learn
[25:04.620 --> 25:05.960]  how to find your own solutions,
[25:06.500 --> 25:08.440]  there's no better feeling. A therapist
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.320]  can help you become a better problem solver,
[25:10.420 --> 25:12.480]  making it easier to accomplish your goals, no
[25:12.480 --> 25:13.980]  matter how big or small.
[25:14.780 --> 25:16.380]  Therapy has made such a tremendous
[25:16.380 --> 25:18.320]  impact in my life. It's something I would recommend
[25:18.320 --> 25:19.620]  to literally everyone.
[25:20.260 --> 25:21.900]  I found for me, it
[25:22.680 --> 25:24.400]  really gave me new
[25:24.400 --> 25:26.380]  insights into myself as well as
[25:26.380 --> 25:28.440]  discovering things that I didn't even know
[25:28.440 --> 25:29.720]  were problems that are.
[25:30.520 --> 25:32.280]  Being able to talk with someone who's
[25:32.280 --> 25:33.840]  trained and an expert
[25:34.380 --> 25:36.400]  can be sometimes difficult to see beyond
[25:36.400 --> 25:38.260]  yourself. So just having those conversations
[25:39.900 --> 25:40.420]  regardless
[25:40.420 --> 25:42.640]  of what the issue is, I think is so incredibly
[25:42.640 --> 25:43.840]  informative and helpful.
[25:43.840 --> 25:45.820]  And just gives you a base going forward
[25:45.820 --> 25:47.160]  that you can really build off of.
[25:47.540 --> 25:49.660]  If you're thinking of giving therapy a try,
[25:50.100 --> 25:51.220]  BetterHelp is a great option.
[25:51.800 --> 25:53.780]  It's convenient, accessible,
[25:54.420 --> 25:55.780]  and entirely online.

[25:57.700 --> 25:59.200]  after filling out a brief survey,
[25:59.600 --> 26:01.320]  and switch therapists anytime.
[26:02.260 --> 26:04.020]  When you want to be a better problem solver,

[26:18.220 --> 26:19.560]  Today's episode is sponsored
[26:19.560 --> 26:21.540]  by Honey, the easy way to save
[26:21.540 --> 26:23.660]  when shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[26:23.880 --> 26:25.360]  I love to online shop.
[26:25.560 --> 26:27.400]  It's the primary way I shop.
[26:27.480 --> 26:28.800]  I use it as much as possible.
[26:29.540 --> 26:31.420]  Whenever I need to buy anything, I hate having to go
[26:31.420 --> 26:33.220]  to a store for it. It's so much more convenient just
[26:33.220 --> 26:35.560]  to do it online. But when I shop online,
[26:35.800 --> 26:37.380]  I never know the promo codes.
[26:37.440 --> 26:39.580]  I never have them ready. But thanks to Honey,
[26:39.580 --> 26:41.760]  manually searching for coupon codes
[26:41.760 --> 26:42.860]  is a thing of the past.
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.660]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the
[26:45.660 --> 26:47.680]  internet for promo codes and applies
[26:47.680 --> 26:49.460]  the best one it finds to your cart.
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.540]  Now imagine you're shopping on one of your
[26:51.540 --> 26:53.500]  favorite sites. When you check out,
[26:53.760 --> 26:55.580]  the Honey button appears and all you have to
[26:55.580 --> 26:57.360]  do is click Apply Coupons.
[26:57.860 --> 26:59.580]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for
[26:59.580 --> 27:01.040]  coupons it can find for that site.
[27:01.320 --> 27:03.100]  If Honey finds a working coupon,
[27:03.480 --> 27:05.400]  you'll watch the prices drop instantly.
[27:06.040 --> 27:07.420]  I've saved money with Honey
[27:07.420 --> 27:08.960]  using... that kind of rhymed.
[27:09.460 --> 27:11.320]  I've saved money with Honey. That's great.
[27:11.900 --> 27:13.260]  I've saved on things like
[27:13.260 --> 27:15.420]  tech, clothing, food,
[27:15.560 --> 27:17.620]  you name it. I've saved in so many different ways.
[27:17.760 --> 27:19.520]  It's so convenient. It's just an easy
[27:19.520 --> 27:21.360]  thing to check. Even sometimes
[27:21.360 --> 27:22.960]  if there isn't a coupon that works,
[27:23.640 --> 27:25.640]  it's easy. It's so quick and efficient.
[27:25.960 --> 27:27.620]  It'd be ridiculous not to use it.
[27:28.280 --> 27:29.660]  Honey doesn't just work on desktop.
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.300]  It works on your iPhone too.
[27:31.800 --> 27:33.580]  Just activate it on Safari on your
[27:33.580 --> 27:34.960]  phone and save on the go.
[27:34.960 --> 27:37.020]  If you don't already have Honey,
[27:37.280 --> 27:38.720]  you could be straight up missing out.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.040]  And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid
[27:41.040 --> 27:42.360]  and supporting this show.
[27:42.840 --> 27:44.640]  I'd never recommend something I don't use.

[27:49.960 --> 27:50.900]  Quitting smoking
[27:50.900 --> 27:52.540]  is incredibly difficult.
[27:52.720 --> 27:54.780]  Even after you've quit, trying to curb those
[27:54.780 --> 27:57.000]  cravings is also incredibly
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.100]  challenging. I've had people in my family who smoked
[27:59.100 --> 28:00.780]  and then quit smoking and just
[28:00.780 --> 28:02.880]  having conversations with them and hearing about that
[28:02.880 --> 28:05.100]  struggle, I have an understanding
[28:05.100 --> 28:06.660]  of how much of a challenge it can be.
[28:07.100 --> 28:08.740]  And that's why you've got to check out Fume.
[28:09.280 --> 28:11.000]  Fume is the natural inhaler designed
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.940]  for a better, safer, and natural way
[28:12.940 --> 28:14.800]  to quit cigarettes. It's a no
[28:14.800 --> 28:16.880]  smoke, no vape, and no
[28:16.880 --> 28:19.000]  nicotine replacement for the hand-to-mouth habit
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.720]  of smoking. Fume
[28:20.720 --> 28:23.020]  handcrafts wooden inhalers and uses
[28:23.020 --> 28:24.880]  cores infused with plant oils studied
[28:24.880 --> 28:27.020]  to curb cravings. They have flavors
[28:27.020 --> 28:28.860]  like Peppermint and Conquer with minty notes
[28:28.860 --> 28:30.800]  to simulate menthol cigarettes, and
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.700]  other flavors like Cozy Chai and Lemon
[28:32.700 --> 28:35.120]  Berry Bliss for a sweeter experience.
[28:35.560 --> 28:36.780]  And all of their flavors are
[28:36.780 --> 28:38.820]  100% natural. No harmful
[28:38.820 --> 28:40.680]  chemicals, no artificial flavors,
[28:41.180 --> 28:42.840]  and absolutely no nicotine.
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.820]  Quitting is tough, but
[28:44.820 --> 28:46.720]  Fume really can help. They've got
[28:46.720 --> 28:48.880]  thousands of 5-star reviews from smokers
[28:48.880 --> 28:50.920]  who have tried everything else, and this
[28:50.920 --> 28:52.920]  worked. Another fantastic thing
[28:52.920 --> 28:55.020]  about Fume is if you're somebody who flies a lot,
[28:55.360 --> 28:56.780]  being able to use Fume in the air
[28:56.780 --> 28:58.820]  and in the airport is a huge difference
[28:58.820 --> 29:00.840]  maker. Whether you're a smoker
[29:00.840 --> 29:03.000]  or ex-smoker who still struggles with cravings,
[29:03.680 --> 29:04.720]  Fume is the perfect
[29:04.720 --> 29:06.440]  tool for you. Head to

[29:26.580 --> 29:28.240]  So what's the next item on your list?
[29:28.480 --> 29:29.860]  Where were we at? We just did Monkey.
[29:29.940 --> 29:31.340]  That was Monkey Movie, right?
[29:31.580 --> 29:33.940]  That was Monkey Movie.
[29:34.560 --> 29:36.420]  Oh my god.
[29:37.480 --> 29:38.260]  That was Monkey Movie.
[29:38.840 --> 29:40.880]  The next thing I have on my list
[29:40.880 --> 29:42.420]  is that we should mention
[29:43.420 --> 29:44.740]  that we have a very
[29:44.740 --> 29:46.920]  special... we're still formulating
[29:46.920 --> 29:49.280]  it, but we have a very special
[29:50.080 --> 29:51.380]  live stream coming up.
[29:51.680 --> 29:53.080]  We have discussed it in the past.
[29:53.640 --> 29:53.980]  I'm not sure if you guys
[29:53.980 --> 29:55.920]  I think the audience at this point knows we're gonna be
[29:55.920 --> 29:58.000]  selling socks individually
[29:58.000 --> 29:58.860]  cursed by Gavin
[29:59.760 --> 30:01.600]  at some point. And so we're gonna
[30:01.600 --> 30:03.400]  I think on Halloween
[30:03.980 --> 30:06.260]  on Halloween day, it's a Monday, October 31st
[30:06.260 --> 30:07.820]  I think the plan is to do a live
[30:07.820 --> 30:09.200]  stream where
[30:09.900 --> 30:11.780]  Gavin curses the socks live
[30:11.780 --> 30:13.840]  while we do some other shenanigans
[30:13.840 --> 30:15.860]  and other stuff as well. And we have
[30:15.860 --> 30:17.880]  a really fun way to work
[30:17.880 --> 30:19.840]  Andrew into it that I have been
[30:19.840 --> 30:21.900]  doing some research on. I'm gonna try to build it here
[30:21.900 --> 30:23.780]  pretty soon, this contraption
[30:23.780 --> 30:25.880]  to include Andrew. And we're gonna have a
[30:25.880 --> 30:26.840]  cursed socks stream.
[30:28.120 --> 30:29.880]  It looks great. Like everything that we've talked
[30:29.880 --> 30:31.520]  about, I think it's gonna be very funny.
[30:32.240 --> 30:33.720]  Some of it is covered in Sausage Talk
[30:33.720 --> 30:35.660]  which I don't know when that will come out, but that will
[30:35.660 --> 30:38.120]  provide more insight into some of these
[30:38.120 --> 30:38.660]  ideas.
[30:39.380 --> 30:41.920]  When does Sausage Talk come out? I have no
[30:41.920 --> 30:44.020]  idea. Nick said it should be ready after today.
[30:44.540 --> 30:45.960]  I was gonna say, by the
[30:45.960 --> 30:47.740]  time this episode comes out
[30:48.520 --> 30:50.000]  it should be out right on the
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.320]  tail of it, I think.
[30:52.080 --> 30:53.900]  We can dial that in, but it should be
[30:53.900 --> 30:55.740]  again, you're listening to this episode, so
[30:55.740 --> 30:57.860]  it comes out next week for
[30:57.860 --> 31:00.020]  us recording right now. Okay, cool.
[31:00.840 --> 31:02.140]  Um, Eric, can we also
[31:02.140 --> 31:03.380]  talk about some of the other
[31:04.060 --> 31:06.120]  like, cause we had a really good merch meeting yesterday
[31:06.120 --> 31:08.220]  and can we talk about like the plan
[31:08.220 --> 31:10.280]  for some of that stuff or is it too early to get people's
[31:10.280 --> 31:12.200]  hopes up? Shit, I say just go for it.
[31:12.240 --> 31:13.880]  Why not? Alright, so...
[31:13.880 --> 31:15.580]  This holds our feet to the fire, so let's do it.
[31:15.740 --> 31:17.900]  Here's what I'm aware of that we have coming out.
[31:17.900 --> 31:19.900]  Obviously the cursed
[31:19.900 --> 31:22.140]  socks I think will go on sale
[31:22.140 --> 31:24.200]  at or
[31:24.200 --> 31:26.240]  right after the spooky Halloween
[31:26.240 --> 31:28.240]  cursed sock livestream that we're gonna do
[31:28.240 --> 31:29.900]  that I'm very excited about.
[31:29.960 --> 31:31.600]  I think the livestream might even be a countdown
[31:31.600 --> 31:33.780]  to selling the socks.
[31:33.860 --> 31:36.500]  Because obviously we don't want to sell them until Gavin curses them.
[31:37.740 --> 31:38.340]  And then
[31:38.340 --> 31:39.640]  I believe our
[31:39.640 --> 31:41.980]  big Black Friday item
[31:42.680 --> 31:44.120]  that I'm very...
[31:44.120 --> 31:45.980]  I don't know why, no I do know why cause it's
[31:45.980 --> 31:47.920]  awesome. Probably the piece of merch
[31:47.920 --> 31:49.740]  I'm most excited about in the history of F***face
[31:49.740 --> 31:51.340]  is the Gerpler.
[31:51.500 --> 31:53.620]  It's gonna come out on October 31st.
[31:53.760 --> 31:55.800]  I'm sorry, Black Friday.
[31:56.140 --> 31:57.940]  Black Friday. And I think
[31:57.940 --> 31:59.780]  we'll have a Gerpler on hand during the
[31:59.780 --> 32:01.540]  livestream on October 31st to show.
[32:01.700 --> 32:03.200]  As like, you know, a sample.
[32:03.360 --> 32:05.860]  Then on Cyber Monday, not to be
[32:05.860 --> 32:07.940]  outdone by the Gerpler on Black
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.160]  Friday, Cyber Monday
[32:09.960 --> 32:11.720]  you didn't think it could be real.
[32:12.240 --> 32:13.940]  You couldn't imagine that we'd actually
[32:13.940 --> 32:16.000]  make it. But I have
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.920]  it on good authority that on Cyber
[32:17.920 --> 32:19.960]  Monday we will put the SwitchFuck
[32:19.960 --> 32:20.660]  up for sale.
[32:22.080 --> 32:24.080]  We actually got the SwitchFuck made
[32:24.080 --> 32:25.800]  or it's being made as we speak.
[32:25.920 --> 32:27.980]  And we're gonna put it on sale Cyber
[32:27.980 --> 32:29.940]  Monday. I hope it doesn't fall
[32:29.940 --> 32:31.920]  flat on our face because I will lose a lot
[32:31.920 --> 32:33.580]  of capital
[32:34.080 --> 32:35.800]  in the company if the SwitchFuck
[32:35.800 --> 32:38.000]  isn't a success. Because that one took
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.860]  a little bit of convincing to get made.
[32:40.240 --> 32:42.060]  Do we know how many SwitchFucks
[32:42.060 --> 32:43.980]  have been made? That'd be
[32:43.980 --> 32:45.720]  interesting to know. I have no idea.
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.620]  I think it was a few hundred but
[32:47.620 --> 32:49.520]  I really don't remember.
[32:50.400 --> 32:52.160]  Understood. Also, you mentioned
[32:52.160 --> 32:54.220]  the GrownTubes hadn't sold
[32:54.220 --> 32:56.020]  and I guess that turned a lot of
[32:56.020 --> 32:56.980]  attention to it. Sold out.
[32:58.060 --> 32:59.480]  I was told that
[33:00.060 --> 33:01.900]  maybe by the time that episode aired they'd already
[33:01.900 --> 33:03.720]  sold out. Oh no.
[33:04.220 --> 33:05.720]  Shit. We're the worst.
[33:06.040 --> 33:07.940]  We suck at that. But hey,
[33:07.980 --> 33:09.380]  we're letting people know a full
[33:09.380 --> 33:11.040]  When did this come out?
[33:12.080 --> 33:13.460]  We're letting people know two days
[33:13.460 --> 33:15.000]  in advance
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.480]  about these baseballs.
[33:17.720 --> 33:19.060]  We haven't put them on sale
[33:19.060 --> 33:20.080]  as of this recording.
[33:20.760 --> 33:23.500]  That can't repeat. I think that's it.
[33:23.620 --> 33:25.360]  There's discussion about a baseball jersey
[33:25.360 --> 33:27.300]  coming out at some point. I'm not really sure when
[33:27.300 --> 33:29.180]  that'll be. That's been kind of
[33:29.180 --> 33:31.160]  bounced around forever. And I think that's all we have
[33:31.160 --> 33:33.460]  out there in the ether right now that I'm aware
[33:33.460 --> 33:35.400]  of. We've been trying to get that vinyl of episode
[33:35.400 --> 33:37.380]  16 made for about two years now it feels like
[33:37.380 --> 33:38.000]  and that's still
[33:39.580 --> 33:41.260]  in the ether somewhere.
[33:42.040 --> 33:43.060]  Am I missing anything?
[33:43.400 --> 33:45.280]  I don't think so. No, I think that's
[33:45.920 --> 33:46.900]  the bulk of it.
[33:47.280 --> 33:49.260]  That was quite a good roundup. It was.
[33:49.320 --> 33:51.280]  Not to go too deeply into
[33:51.280 --> 33:53.340]  self-promotion talk, but I had kind of a funny thing
[33:53.340 --> 33:55.040]  happen relating to this show
[33:55.040 --> 33:57.300]  in a sense the other night.
[33:57.380 --> 33:58.720]  I watched the second episode
[33:59.300 --> 34:01.460]  Does It Do? which I had heard
[34:01.460 --> 34:03.160]  a lot about of Gavin's fall
[34:03.920 --> 34:05.480]  and the things around it.
[34:05.480 --> 34:07.420]  It was like a weekend
[34:07.420 --> 34:09.500]  I think it was Saturday. It was
[34:09.500 --> 34:10.600]  2 a.m. It was very late.
[34:11.400 --> 34:13.560]  I was like, you know, I'm going to finally watch this. I just hadn't
[34:13.560 --> 34:15.000]  seen it yet for whatever reason.
[34:15.320 --> 34:17.480]  I was excited to watch. I laughed so
[34:17.480 --> 34:19.360]  goddamn hard at your fall,
[34:19.540 --> 34:21.060]  Gavin. Mainly because I knew
[34:22.040 --> 34:23.040]  you were okay.
[34:23.460 --> 34:25.500]  Ultimately, we had talked post-fall
[34:26.140 --> 34:27.300]  and that it was
[34:27.300 --> 34:28.640]  so self-inflicted.
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.380]  It was entirely your fault and it didn't
[34:31.380 --> 34:32.720]  go the way you wanted at all.
[34:32.720 --> 34:34.680]  I had a good laugh at it.
[34:34.760 --> 34:36.760]  I was like, man, I really want to watch that impact again.
[34:37.220 --> 34:38.820]  I went
[34:38.820 --> 34:40.640]  back and I paused
[34:40.640 --> 34:42.600]  right when you hit.
[34:43.120 --> 34:44.780]  I died.
[34:44.980 --> 34:46.820]  I died of laughter.
[34:47.320 --> 34:48.820]  I was wheezing.
[34:49.020 --> 34:50.820]  It's the hardest I've laughed
[34:50.820 --> 34:52.080]  in a long time.
[34:52.500 --> 34:54.620]  I didn't want to wake my partner up
[34:54.620 --> 34:56.880]  so I'm trying to suppress it
[34:56.880 --> 34:58.820]  and I'm just like...
[34:58.820 --> 35:00.920]  I'm just wheezing
[35:00.920 --> 35:02.780]  and I'm so loud
[35:02.780 --> 35:04.120]  and I can't stop myself.
[35:04.240 --> 35:07.060]  I was crying. There were tears coming down
[35:07.060 --> 35:08.560]  my face. I couldn't stop.
[35:08.900 --> 35:10.960]  I'm so sorry. I'm trying to
[35:10.960 --> 35:13.060]  be quiet. Just from looking at this
[35:13.060 --> 35:14.140]  paused frame...
[35:14.880 --> 35:17.000]  I genuinely laughed
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.780]  without pause for probably
[35:18.780 --> 35:20.880]  80 seconds. I couldn't stop.
[35:21.280 --> 35:22.560]  And then I gathered myself
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.840]  and just look at the photo.
[35:25.020 --> 35:26.820]  It looks like all of your bones
[35:26.820 --> 35:29.000]  are escaping through a magic
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.300]  trap door on the floor.
[35:30.740 --> 35:32.980]  Everything is leaving. Everything is
[35:32.980 --> 35:34.580]  gone. So then I
[35:34.580 --> 35:36.980]  un-paused it for a second and then
[35:36.980 --> 35:39.140]  re-paused it and I got this angle
[35:39.140 --> 35:41.340]  and then I just started all over again.
[35:41.700 --> 35:43.180]  And I couldn't... There was no
[35:43.180 --> 35:44.920]  muffling that. I couldn't
[35:44.920 --> 35:46.960]  stop laughing. You got like an
[35:46.960 --> 35:48.800]  E.T. arm. You're just...
[35:48.800 --> 35:50.900]  You're destroyed. You have wrecked your
[35:50.900 --> 35:52.660]  body in the least
[35:52.660 --> 35:55.020]  entertaining way visually I've ever
[35:55.020 --> 35:56.720]  seen. There's nothing impressive.
[35:56.720 --> 35:58.520]  It was such...
[35:58.520 --> 36:00.840]  You did so much damage
[36:00.840 --> 36:02.680]  and nothing about it
[36:02.680 --> 36:04.420]  looked cool or funny
[36:04.420 --> 36:06.740]  and you did it yourself. And that's
[36:06.740 --> 36:07.980]  what I think really got me.
[36:09.140 --> 36:10.680]  I need to remember that when I
[36:10.680 --> 36:12.740]  go to try and push someone or tackle
[36:12.740 --> 36:14.680]  someone, all I do is bounce off. It's
[36:14.680 --> 36:16.020]  all I've ever done my entire life.
[36:17.100 --> 36:18.640]  I just gotta come to terms with it.
[36:19.780 --> 36:20.940]  The next day
[36:20.940 --> 36:22.760]  I said, I'm so sorry. I probably woke you
[36:22.760 --> 36:24.340]  up. I couldn't... I was looking at Gav
[36:24.340 --> 36:25.640]  falling and
[36:26.400 --> 36:28.440]  they said, yeah, I couldn't tell if you were
[36:28.440 --> 36:30.080]  laughing or crying.
[36:31.460 --> 36:31.940]  Genuinely
[36:32.780 --> 36:34.520]  extremely upset. And once
[36:34.520 --> 36:36.440]  I noticed that it was laughter
[36:36.440 --> 36:38.120]  then I was like, that's fine.
[36:38.560 --> 36:39.860]  Oh, I was a mess.
[36:40.500 --> 36:41.940]  It was such a good laugh.
[36:42.240 --> 36:44.440]  Maybe my biggest laugh of the year.
[36:44.800 --> 36:46.340]  Oh, I'm bummed it
[36:46.340 --> 36:47.560]  wasn't being recorded.
[36:48.200 --> 36:50.100]  Oh, it was great. It was a great time.
[36:50.680 --> 36:52.520]  Eric, speaking of does it do,
[36:52.520 --> 36:54.280]  when do we get to make more of it?
[36:54.540 --> 36:55.440]  End of October.
[36:56.740 --> 36:58.820]  Yeah, I just had a
[36:58.820 --> 37:00.560]  conversation with someone to make sure that we have
[37:00.560 --> 37:02.040]  space and time in the
[37:02.520 --> 37:04.560]  studio. So end of October is what we're
[37:04.560 --> 37:06.340]  looking at. But before the sock cursing.
[37:06.720 --> 37:08.120]  Before the sock cursing, yes.
[37:09.020 --> 37:10.440]  It'll just have to be a couple weeks into
[37:10.440 --> 37:12.600]  October. We can't get studio before
[37:12.600 --> 37:14.520]  that. So it'll probably come out
[37:14.520 --> 37:16.400]  like episodes three through
[37:16.400 --> 37:18.500]  eight, I think it is.
[37:18.580 --> 37:20.540]  We'll come out in November and December
[37:20.540 --> 37:22.300]  then probably. Yeah, I would think November, December.
[37:22.440 --> 37:24.480]  Kind of like round out the year with hopefully
[37:24.480 --> 37:26.080]  Gavin not breaking anything.
[37:26.380 --> 37:26.720]  Yeah.
[37:28.500 --> 37:30.560]  I gotta say, I'm really bummed
[37:30.560 --> 37:32.560]  about the incredibly long break
[37:32.560 --> 37:34.400]  between releases.
[37:34.520 --> 37:36.540]  But I'm really excited
[37:36.540 --> 37:38.600]  about recording these next six
[37:38.600 --> 37:40.520]  because I think we figured a lot out in the first
[37:40.520 --> 37:42.480]  two episodes. And then, not to get
[37:42.480 --> 37:44.600]  into the sausage talk, but then we had, and I know we covered
[37:44.600 --> 37:46.600]  this in sausage talk even, we had a really
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.460]  good meeting where we came up with a lot of really good
[37:48.460 --> 37:50.140]  ideas and I think we'll be a lot more prepared
[37:50.700 --> 37:52.580]  and I think because of that, they'll be a lot
[37:52.580 --> 37:54.600]  punchier, episodes three through eight.
[37:54.600 --> 37:55.860]  Yeah, I agree.
[37:56.440 --> 37:58.620]  Not that the first two were bad, I thought they were great
[37:58.620 --> 38:00.660]  but just knowing, I've been excited
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.260]  to see what's coming
[38:02.260 --> 38:04.460]  with the outline that we have. Would you ever be
[38:04.460 --> 38:06.600]  in one, Andrew? Yeah, I'd be in one.
[38:07.400 --> 38:08.640]  If you were in the country.
[38:08.640 --> 38:10.380]  If I was in the country, yeah, I'd
[38:10.380 --> 38:12.460]  gladly be in one, absolutely. I think I would
[38:12.460 --> 38:13.920]  want to bring my own product though.
[38:14.360 --> 38:16.460]  I know that's a weird demand.
[38:16.460 --> 38:18.600]  I feel like I'd want to surprise you guys with something.
[38:18.960 --> 38:20.820]  I like that idea, I love it.
[38:20.980 --> 38:21.860]  I don't know what that is yet.
[38:22.060 --> 38:23.800]  You won't come to America until November.
[38:23.980 --> 38:26.040]  I will not be in America until at least November.
[38:26.160 --> 38:28.620]  Should I be not making any plans
[38:28.620 --> 38:30.480]  for November? Why would you make plans
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.380]  for November? Well, I'm saying, if
[38:32.380 --> 38:33.880]  Andrew's potentially coming,
[38:34.580 --> 38:36.620]  I never said I'd be in America
[38:36.620 --> 38:37.180]  in November.
[38:37.880 --> 38:40.300]  I was open to being in America
[38:40.300 --> 38:42.540]  as of November. Weren't we all
[38:42.540 --> 38:44.300]  gonna maybe secretly go to Vegas
[38:44.300 --> 38:46.600]  in November and just hang out?
[38:47.240 --> 38:48.240]  You were gonna, originally,
[38:48.420 --> 38:50.280]  so there was a plan for Vegas, and then that
[38:50.280 --> 38:51.920]  fell through due to no fault of my own.
[38:52.160 --> 38:54.520]  No, no fault of yours. Then there was a discussion
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.120]  that you guys would come here
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.200]  in November, and then there was
[38:58.200 --> 39:00.500]  also talks of Vegas in November as well.
[39:00.880 --> 39:02.240]  There have been all sorts of November talks.
[39:02.820 --> 39:03.940]  We should solidify something.
[39:04.100 --> 39:06.380]  I would like us all to breathe the same air
[39:06.380 --> 39:07.980]  in November if humanly possible.
[39:08.220 --> 39:10.340]  Yeah, I like that idea a lot. I don't think you do.
[39:10.420 --> 39:12.360]  Because you didn't say that you were
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.240]  really up for going in November.
[39:14.380 --> 39:15.660]  You just wouldn't go before November.
[39:16.120 --> 39:17.780]  I just said I liked the idea, though.
[39:18.340 --> 39:19.460]  I just don't believe it.
[39:19.660 --> 39:22.260]  Okay, that's fine. I'm not gonna
[39:22.260 --> 39:24.080]  fuckin' try to change my beliefs to
[39:24.080 --> 39:26.280]  some goddamn... I don't even remember what
[39:26.280 --> 39:28.240]  he said you tasted at this point. Never mind.
[39:29.620 --> 39:30.360]  But I'm not gonna
[39:30.360 --> 39:32.440]  argue over that. You know, I'd like to change my answer.
[39:32.640 --> 39:34.400]  I don't think you're tomato-based. This tomato-based motherfucker.
[39:34.600 --> 39:36.800]  I'm not gonna go into a debate war with...
[39:36.800 --> 39:38.600]  I think he tastes like prawns, Gavin.
[39:39.120 --> 39:39.800]  Oh. Really?
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.740]  Maybe like cocktail sauce.
[39:42.280 --> 39:42.800]  Yeah.
[39:43.320 --> 39:46.080]  But he calls it something else, maybe.
[39:46.800 --> 39:47.860]  Like a cocktail sauce
[39:47.860 --> 39:49.720]  that isn't called a cocktail
[39:49.720 --> 39:51.860]  sauce, but actually is just
[39:51.860 --> 39:53.660]  a cocktail sauce. Interesting.
[39:54.200 --> 39:55.520]  Potentially. Okay.
[39:56.160 --> 39:57.720]  I'll say that. I like cocktail sauce.
[39:57.980 --> 39:59.660]  You definitely taste like a condiment, though.
[40:03.060 --> 40:03.520]  Tots?
[40:05.340 --> 40:05.860]  Uh...
[40:05.860 --> 40:07.980]  I don't know why we need to ruin today with that talk.
[40:07.980 --> 40:08.740]  Uh...
[40:09.300 --> 40:11.760]  Uh, the next thing I have
[40:11.760 --> 40:13.620]  on my list, if we want to keep
[40:13.620 --> 40:15.660]  the ball rolling, because we're running...
[40:16.820 --> 40:17.600]  is, uh,
[40:17.700 --> 40:19.660]  moving along, uh...
[40:20.360 --> 40:21.840]  I have a, uh...
[40:21.840 --> 40:23.700]  I have right here, this is, I think, a
[40:23.700 --> 40:25.620]  teeing up you, Gavin. I just have Eric
[40:25.620 --> 40:27.440]  Hypocrite written down, and I don't know why
[40:27.440 --> 40:29.680]  it's just held over from last time you were gonna
[40:29.680 --> 40:31.280]  play a video, audio or something.
[40:31.700 --> 40:34.120]  Oh, yeah! I didn't get that audio yet.
[40:34.760 --> 40:35.840]  Great. Great work.
[40:36.400 --> 40:37.200]  Eric Hypocrite.
[40:37.320 --> 40:39.680]  All right, well, we'll push Eric Hypocrite
[40:39.680 --> 40:42.280]  till episode 104, I guess.
[40:42.960 --> 40:43.980]  It would involve listening to
[40:43.980 --> 40:46.000]  Face Jam, which I haven't brought myself to be able to do yet,
[40:47.040 --> 40:47.440]  but...
[40:47.440 --> 40:48.740]  Right on. Thanks, man.
[40:53.140 --> 40:53.540]  Uh...
[40:53.540 --> 40:54.440]  I will say...
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.000]  We can just confront him based on the comments.
[40:58.060 --> 40:59.280]  This is your show, man.
[40:59.880 --> 41:00.680]  You're running this.
[41:00.840 --> 41:03.100]  Maybe Eric can pluck out what he was talking about.
[41:03.100 --> 41:05.000]  A lot of people in the comments, Eric, saying that
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.980]  you pretty much went down the route of
[41:06.980 --> 41:07.760]  extra medium.
[41:09.520 --> 41:12.120]  In a range of days
[41:12.120 --> 41:12.820]  in a month.
[41:13.400 --> 41:15.160]  In a range of days, there's a beginning,
[41:15.320 --> 41:17.160]  there's a middle, and there's an end, and you have a range
[41:17.160 --> 41:18.600]  within them. Gavin, when you go
[41:18.600 --> 41:20.660]  to store.roosterteeth.com
[41:21.880 --> 41:22.280]  and
[41:22.960 --> 41:25.200]  you click on a random shirt. Here's one.
[41:25.400 --> 41:27.240]  Easy Allies. Weakling T-shirt.
[41:27.440 --> 41:28.200]  On the front page.
[41:28.800 --> 41:31.220]  Just scroll down. Oh, they have extra small, small, medium.
[41:31.220 --> 41:32.840]  They have all the sizes, up to 4X.
[41:33.040 --> 41:35.240]  That's great. Oh, I wonder what sizes they are.
[41:36.200 --> 41:37.260]  Oh, looking here,
[41:37.480 --> 41:39.080]  there's one number here for medium.
[41:39.800 --> 41:40.240]  Okay.
[41:40.700 --> 41:42.860]  That's interesting. So it's not a range.
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.620]  So it is just a single number.
[41:45.180 --> 41:47.100]  And in order for something to be
[41:47.100 --> 41:48.900]  a range, like a range of days,
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.800]  there would have to be multiple days to choose from.
[41:51.100 --> 41:53.360]  But what I'm looking at is just a single number
[41:53.360 --> 41:54.700]  that says chest 20 inches.
[41:55.900 --> 41:57.260]  I mean, does range
[41:57.260 --> 41:57.960]  within an inch?
[41:59.200 --> 42:00.160]  You're saying
[42:00.160 --> 42:01.960]  that what you asked me for
[42:01.960 --> 42:04.100]  when you asked for an extra medium
[42:04.100 --> 42:06.120]  was getting down to
[42:07.820 --> 42:08.300]  quarter
[42:08.940 --> 42:09.420]  inches?
[42:10.420 --> 42:11.780]  If there's no range, Eric,
[42:11.960 --> 42:13.540]  then extra medium would be 20.
[42:13.840 --> 42:15.800]  No, that's medium. You got me large!
[42:16.020 --> 42:16.920]  That's the problem!
[42:17.620 --> 42:18.760]  You brought large!
[42:20.040 --> 42:22.040]  Yeah, because you wanted something bigger than medium.
[42:23.600 --> 42:24.200]  So what
[42:24.200 --> 42:25.220]  were you saying about the dates?
[42:25.820 --> 42:26.260]  So,
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.140]  the beginning of the month is like
[42:29.140 --> 42:31.080]  the 1st to the 10th, the middle of the month is like the
[42:31.080 --> 42:32.940]  11th to the 20th, and the end of the month is like the
[42:32.940 --> 42:34.780]  21st through the 30th to the 31st.
[42:34.920 --> 42:37.120]  However, that sort of ranges
[42:37.120 --> 42:39.160]  out, because there's a range of dates
[42:39.160 --> 42:41.200]  there. And the 15th would be...
[42:41.200 --> 42:42.160]  Medium 20 inches.
[42:43.720 --> 42:44.900]  Medium 20 inches.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.960]  One number. Looking at one number here.
[42:47.460 --> 42:48.340]  That's just our store.
[42:48.580 --> 42:50.660]  There has been ranges within medium.
[42:51.180 --> 42:53.060]  There has been ranges
[42:53.060 --> 42:54.420]  within medium.
[42:54.780 --> 42:55.800]  Well, that's what Tony said.
[42:56.200 --> 42:58.440]  There has been ranges within medium.
[42:59.160 --> 43:00.300]  When I'm on our store.
[43:00.660 --> 43:02.360]  But what you've proven with the date thing is that
[43:02.360 --> 43:04.580]  at a deep level,
[43:04.780 --> 43:06.940]  at core level, you understand
[43:06.940 --> 43:08.380]  the concept of extra medium.
[43:09.020 --> 43:10.880]  No, no. I understand the concept of
[43:10.880 --> 43:11.180]  ranges.
[43:12.180 --> 43:15.020]  And what you're expressing is not
[43:15.020 --> 43:16.580]  the most medium,
[43:16.980 --> 43:18.060]  which doesn't exist.
[43:19.480 --> 43:20.980]  Because it's not a range,
[43:20.980 --> 43:22.340]  what you've asked for.
[43:23.460 --> 43:24.160]  It's a size.
[43:24.480 --> 43:27.020]  Is this the fifth time we've had this argument?
[43:28.240 --> 43:29.080]  I'm not having
[43:29.080 --> 43:30.600]  the argument. I'm just, I'm simply
[43:30.600 --> 43:32.880]  stating a fact, and you're
[43:32.880 --> 43:34.780]  arguing. And so, I mean,
[43:35.500 --> 43:36.980]  that's just sort of how it goes.
[43:37.280 --> 43:38.840]  It's really incredible how many people
[43:38.840 --> 43:40.880]  have come out. It's great. I was talking
[43:40.880 --> 43:42.180]  to Geoff about this the other night at dinner.
[43:43.360 --> 43:44.860]  Oh yeah, let's talk about this dinner. We'll get
[43:44.860 --> 43:45.820]  into it in the next episode.
[43:46.980 --> 43:47.780]  The thing
[43:47.780 --> 43:49.800]  The thing I really like
[43:49.800 --> 43:51.740]  is the hubris of people making
[43:51.740 --> 43:53.700]  topics going, I'm here
[43:53.700 --> 43:55.540]  to settle the debate.
[43:55.720 --> 43:57.840]  And then they have an opinion, and then it's
[43:57.840 --> 43:59.780]  88 comments of people
[43:59.780 --> 44:00.460]  arguing.
[44:02.520 --> 44:04.260]  The one to end it all.
[44:04.700 --> 44:05.920]  The idea that they're sitting
[44:05.920 --> 44:07.320]  at home going, guys,
[44:07.480 --> 44:09.880]  I've got just the thing that's
[44:09.880 --> 44:11.800]  going to get everyone on the same page.
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.680]  And it doesn't
[44:13.680 --> 44:14.880]  by a mile.
[44:18.660 --> 44:19.800]  I think that's been
[44:19.800 --> 44:21.880]  my favorite part of the whole thing. That and being
[44:21.880 --> 44:24.120]  right have been my favorite parts of the whole thing.
[44:26.460 --> 44:27.860]  Can I ask you a hard-hitting
[44:27.860 --> 44:29.380]  question, Gavin? Yeah.
[44:29.800 --> 44:32.080]  What does extra medium taste like?
[44:34.500 --> 44:34.940]  Pepper.
[44:35.820 --> 44:36.900]  I think it tastes like salt.
[44:39.780 --> 44:41.680]  Somewhere between salt, pepper, and bullshit.
[44:41.880 --> 44:43.820]  One of those three things.
[44:44.940 --> 44:45.940]  Could this episode be
[44:45.940 --> 44:47.040]  salt, pepper, and bullshit?
[44:48.020 --> 44:49.180]  You got it.
[44:53.590 --> 44:55.030]  I am so
[44:55.030 --> 44:57.310]  mystified that extra
[44:57.310 --> 44:58.890]  medium has
[44:59.410 --> 45:01.350]  had the life that it's had.
[45:01.590 --> 45:03.410]  We were discussing this the other day.
[45:05.070 --> 45:07.310]  It feels like next to the
[45:07.310 --> 45:09.630]  comment lever versus regulation
[45:09.630 --> 45:11.610]  listener discussion,
[45:11.870 --> 45:13.250]  probably the most disgusting
[45:13.250 --> 45:15.590]  in the history of f***face at this point.
[45:16.130 --> 45:17.530]  And we talk about
[45:17.530 --> 45:18.530]  that in Sausage Talk.
[45:19.010 --> 45:21.770]  Well, it's continued. It's gotten even crazier.
[45:22.370 --> 45:22.910]  And I still,
[45:23.770 --> 45:25.570]  you know, you want to
[45:25.570 --> 45:27.230]  find funny ways to
[45:27.230 --> 45:29.310]  turn the bit into, I don't know,
[45:29.670 --> 45:31.230]  some silly piece of merch or
[45:31.230 --> 45:32.130]  some way to
[45:33.710 --> 45:35.710]  elevate this, but I, for the life
[45:35.710 --> 45:37.530]  of me, can't figure out how to turn extra medium
[45:37.530 --> 45:39.170]  into something that people would want to own.
[45:39.390 --> 45:40.370]  I don't think we have to.
[45:40.850 --> 45:42.490]  I guess we won't, then.
[45:42.490 --> 45:44.230]  I mean, it's in the
[45:44.230 --> 45:45.470]  store now.
[45:46.870 --> 45:47.830]  Every time
[45:48.490 --> 45:50.250]  they buy an extra medium f***face shirt,
[45:50.350 --> 45:52.130]  they're buying an extra medium f***face shirt.
[45:52.490 --> 45:54.330]  And I think on the actual shirt, it'll be
[45:54.330 --> 45:55.250]  printed that way, eventually.
[45:55.650 --> 45:58.230]  That would be very funny. Insane.
[45:58.970 --> 45:59.410]  Insane.
[46:01.510 --> 46:02.570]  I have a travel story.
[46:02.810 --> 46:04.570]  Hold on a second. I'm taking Eric Hippocrite off.
[46:05.130 --> 46:05.570]  Is that right?
[46:06.190 --> 46:07.890]  You can go ahead and erase that.
[46:08.270 --> 46:09.510]  What's your travel story, Geoff?
[46:09.510 --> 46:11.190]  Is your list done?
[46:11.850 --> 46:13.130]  Yeah. Well, I mean, I got it.
[46:13.290 --> 46:15.330]  I just have pastrami, but we can get into that whenever.
[46:15.530 --> 46:16.970]  No, that's way more important.
[46:17.190 --> 46:19.670]  No, no, no. We'll end on pastrami.
[46:19.730 --> 46:20.350]  Tell your travel story.
[46:20.430 --> 46:23.630]  Alright, I was in the airport. Little family vacation.
[46:24.190 --> 46:25.630]  Talking grandparents, siblings,
[46:25.910 --> 46:27.630]  cousins, the lot. Got everyone going.
[46:28.270 --> 46:29.390]  Back to where we're all from.
[46:30.050 --> 46:30.490]  In Italy.
[46:31.830 --> 46:33.650]  And we're just waiting to board the plane.
[46:35.470 --> 46:37.590]  someone is talking. I'm not going to mention who this is.
[46:37.590 --> 46:39.510]  I don't want to say exactly who
[46:39.510 --> 46:40.890]  is responsible for this story.
[46:41.270 --> 46:43.370]  Someone in my family talking to me about
[46:43.370 --> 46:44.110]  House of the Dragon.
[46:44.630 --> 46:47.130]  They were like, oh yeah, I really like the main guy.
[46:47.230 --> 46:49.510]  I was like, oh yeah, Paddy Considine.
[46:49.970 --> 46:51.290]  I like that guy. He's been in a lot of stuff.
[46:51.730 --> 46:53.250]  He's been in Bourne Ultimatum,
[46:53.890 --> 46:55.050]  Great and Hot Fuzz.
[46:55.270 --> 46:56.050]  It's one of the Andes.
[46:56.890 --> 46:59.290]  The World's End. All that Edgar Wright stuff.
[46:59.790 --> 47:00.630]  I shit you not,
[47:01.190 --> 47:03.410]  almost 30 seconds after I just said that,
[47:03.590 --> 47:05.550]  Edgar Wright, the director of Hot Fuzz
[47:05.550 --> 47:07.570]  and The World's End
[47:07.570 --> 47:09.450]  and Shaun of the Dead and all that good stuff
[47:09.450 --> 47:11.250]  that I love, just strolled through the
[47:11.910 --> 47:13.590]  little boarding area for this flight
[47:13.590 --> 47:15.350]  and sat down. And I was like,
[47:15.530 --> 47:16.810]  Jesus Christ!
[47:17.050 --> 47:19.870]  I was like, oh God, that's freaking Edgar Wright.
[47:20.070 --> 47:20.710]  That's amazing.
[47:21.090 --> 47:23.190]  And I didn't want to go up to him and say hi or anything because
[47:23.190 --> 47:25.190]  he's traveling, he's probably working.
[47:25.590 --> 47:26.710]  Didn't want to be weird and annoying.
[47:27.310 --> 47:29.210]  Were you in America, England or
[47:29.210 --> 47:30.550]  Italy at this time?
[47:30.930 --> 47:32.530]  This was in England.
[47:32.530 --> 47:34.010]  This was a Heathrow airport.
[47:34.330 --> 47:35.130]  Alright, thanks. Sorry.
[47:35.290 --> 47:37.130]  I didn't want to make a fool of myself.
[47:37.970 --> 47:39.910]  But I was kind of amazed that that just happened.
[47:40.350 --> 47:42.550]  And then I kept getting put in situations
[47:42.550 --> 47:44.050]  where I ended up right next to him.
[47:44.110 --> 47:45.630]  And I was like, oh, this would actually be a great
[47:46.250 --> 47:47.870]  opportunity to be like, oh, you know,
[47:48.230 --> 47:49.090]  big fan and all that.
[47:49.650 --> 47:51.630]  I even worked on Hot Fuzz for a day. Could have said that.
[47:52.230 --> 47:53.850]  He's used Phantoms, I used Phantoms.
[47:53.950 --> 47:56.450]  I'm sure we could have had a decent conversation.
[47:56.930 --> 47:57.770]  But I didn't want to do it.
[47:58.190 --> 48:00.130]  The family member, one of the family members
[48:00.130 --> 48:02.350]  I was with, is potty trading their kid.
[48:03.510 --> 48:04.270]  And they're
[48:04.270 --> 48:06.510]  trying to get him to go to the bog in real bogs
[48:06.510 --> 48:07.710]  and not piss a nappy.
[48:07.910 --> 48:10.210]  So they got this little travel potty thing
[48:10.210 --> 48:11.530]  that folds out on the floor.
[48:12.410 --> 48:14.170]  And for the last hour
[48:14.170 --> 48:16.070]  they're trying to get him to pee in this thing.
[48:16.490 --> 48:17.930]  Trying to sneak him into a corner,
[48:18.050 --> 48:20.150]  but he just wouldn't go in it. And then right as
[48:20.150 --> 48:22.110]  we boarded the plane, he was able
[48:22.110 --> 48:24.230]  to successfully pee in this little potty.
[48:24.870 --> 48:25.410]  Got on the plane!
[48:26.950 --> 48:28.150]  I was probably in
[48:28.150 --> 48:29.510]  row like 14 or something.
[48:30.330 --> 48:32.130]  Edgar went further back.
[48:32.510 --> 48:34.050]  He sort of sat around the area
[48:34.050 --> 48:35.630]  with my family back there.
[48:36.330 --> 48:37.410]  We get off the plane
[48:37.990 --> 48:39.710]  and I end up right next to Edgar Wright again.
[48:39.910 --> 48:42.050]  We get bussed to the airport we were going to.
[48:42.170 --> 48:44.090]  I won't say the exact airport
[48:44.090 --> 48:46.010]  because I don't really want to dox his trip.
[48:46.490 --> 48:47.950]  But we're on the bus,
[48:48.130 --> 48:50.170]  he was a little bit behind me, and then the doors to the bus
[48:50.170 --> 48:52.310]  opened, except my door got stuck shut.
[48:52.770 --> 48:54.210]  So he was in the
[48:54.210 --> 48:56.050]  line of people going out the door that opened.
[48:56.050 --> 48:57.710]  And by the time he got to me,
[48:57.770 --> 49:00.150]  I'd just been letting people off because I couldn't get through my broken
[49:00.150 --> 49:01.830]  door. And he got to me
[49:01.830 --> 49:03.650]  and was like, oh yeah, you
[49:03.650 --> 49:06.130]  go next, you've been waiting ages. And I was like, oh, he's a really nice
[49:06.130 --> 49:06.870]  guy, that's great.
[49:07.430 --> 49:09.250]  I really want to talk to him. I didn't do it.
[49:09.790 --> 49:11.690]  And then I met up with my family member,
[49:11.690 --> 49:13.650]  who has a kid, who said
[49:13.650 --> 49:15.730]  he had an absolute nightmare on the plane.
[49:16.850 --> 49:17.830]  Absolute nightmare. I was like, oh,
[49:17.890 --> 49:19.010]  what happened? They were like, well,
[49:19.750 --> 49:20.970]  we got the kid to
[49:21.990 --> 49:23.670]  pee in the potty, but
[49:23.670 --> 49:24.930]  we didn't have time to empty it.
[49:25.130 --> 49:27.350]  And it was like this little sealed plastic potty
[49:27.950 --> 49:28.930]  that you can like
[49:29.490 --> 49:30.370]  strap shut.
[49:30.490 --> 49:32.750]  And they were like, oh, we're on the plane and
[49:33.510 --> 49:35.350]  realized that pressure
[49:35.350 --> 49:37.370]  has a huge impact on
[49:37.370 --> 49:39.630]  sealed containers. They put it in the
[49:39.630 --> 49:40.330]  overhead bin
[49:41.910 --> 49:43.710]  and all the piss had shot out
[49:43.710 --> 49:44.690]  the potty
[49:45.350 --> 49:47.530]  and slid all the way down the overhead
[49:47.530 --> 49:49.010]  bin and was dripping on
[49:49.670 --> 49:51.550]  basically one entire side of
[49:51.550 --> 49:53.490]  the plane, in the back of the
[49:53.490 --> 49:55.150]  plane. And I was like,
[49:55.570 --> 49:56.550]  oh shit!
[49:58.090 --> 49:59.470]  Did he piss on
[49:59.470 --> 50:01.230]  Edgar Wright's head? Apparently a bunch of people
[50:01.230 --> 50:02.910]  was landing on their backs and stuff.
[50:03.130 --> 50:03.810]  Oh no!
[50:05.410 --> 50:06.710]  I couldn't get them to,
[50:06.870 --> 50:09.590]  they didn't really notice Edgar Wright or know what he looked like.
[50:09.810 --> 50:11.270]  So, I don't know.
[50:11.450 --> 50:13.750]  There's a very high possibility
[50:14.950 --> 50:15.590]  that one of
[50:15.590 --> 50:16.570]  my family members,
[50:17.090 --> 50:19.650]  two year old family members has pissed on Edgar Wright's
[50:19.650 --> 50:21.490]  head. I really hope he wasn't sat
[50:21.490 --> 50:23.470]  below that because I think by the sounds of it, it went on
[50:23.470 --> 50:24.970]  about five different people's shoulders.
[50:27.390 --> 50:28.790]  And, uh, if,
[50:29.090 --> 50:31.550]  Edgar, if you're listening, I hope that, I hope
[50:31.550 --> 50:32.830]  you knew nothing of that.
[50:32.950 --> 50:35.010]  And I'm a big fan.
[50:36.150 --> 50:37.170]  Sorry if that happened.
[50:38.390 --> 50:39.590]  On behalf of my
[50:39.590 --> 50:39.990]  family.
[50:41.550 --> 50:43.650]  And it just goes to show, we are,
[50:43.870 --> 50:45.690]  this podcast cannot do, we can't
[50:45.690 --> 50:46.990]  do anything with movie directors.
[50:50.690 --> 50:51.750]  That's director number
[50:51.750 --> 50:53.650]  two that are potentially in our bad books.
[51:00.410 --> 51:02.130]  Then we travel, we got
[51:02.130 --> 51:04.210]  in a cab and we're traveling up this
[51:04.790 --> 51:06.190]  mountain path. Where we were
[51:06.190 --> 51:08.270]  going is basically on the top of, it's like
[51:08.270 --> 51:10.330]  hundreds of feet above sea level.
[51:11.050 --> 51:11.710]  And, uh,
[51:12.350 --> 51:14.110]  I'm sat in the little minicab
[51:14.110 --> 51:16.190]  and all I hear coming from the back
[51:16.190 --> 51:18.070]  seat is...
[51:19.710 --> 51:20.270]  And I'm
[51:20.270 --> 51:22.050]  like yelling to the family member again.
[51:22.090 --> 51:23.970]  I'm like, by the way, after all this
[51:23.970 --> 51:25.910]  piss exploded at the top of the plane,
[51:25.970 --> 51:27.910]  did you empty it? And I'm like, well, you know,
[51:27.970 --> 51:29.830]  it mostly got emptied, uh,
[51:30.190 --> 51:32.190]  on the plane. What is wrong with your family?
[51:32.790 --> 51:33.670]  What is wrong with you?
[51:33.670 --> 51:35.950]  It was still spewing out in the back of the
[51:35.950 --> 51:37.950]  minicab, all over all the luggage.
[51:38.290 --> 51:39.930]  As we were like slowly driving up,
[51:40.010 --> 51:40.730]  it was going like...
[51:41.790 --> 51:43.490]  Get this piss out of here!
[51:43.670 --> 51:44.990]  Get the pee away from us!
[51:49.070 --> 51:51.070]  In that toilet, that little mini
[51:51.070 --> 51:52.730]  potty got pressurized twice.
[51:57.810 --> 51:59.290]  Dammit, I read this respectfully.
[51:59.770 --> 52:00.850]  Those people suck.
[52:01.430 --> 52:02.130]  They stink.
[52:02.670 --> 52:03.690]  What are they doing?
[52:05.310 --> 52:06.810]  They didn't have kids.
[52:07.470 --> 52:08.870]  If your kid pisses in his potty,
[52:08.910 --> 52:09.770]  they're potty training him.
[52:10.350 --> 52:12.850]  If he's going to the potty and they don't have time
[52:12.850 --> 52:14.530]  to empty it and they're boarding a plane,
[52:14.690 --> 52:15.430]  what are you going to do?
[52:15.690 --> 52:18.570]  Are there no fucking toilets on the plane?
[52:18.910 --> 52:20.350]  There's a plane void of toilets?
[52:20.970 --> 52:22.490]  We'll get this plane in the air
[52:22.490 --> 52:24.310]  and then dump the pee out.
[52:24.710 --> 52:26.290]  No, you don't. There's no way.
[52:26.470 --> 52:28.190]  You tell somebody.
[52:28.610 --> 52:30.350]  Everybody is okay with you
[52:30.350 --> 52:32.770]  emptying the piss fucking toilet
[52:32.770 --> 52:34.290]  thing. You just say, hey,
[52:34.670 --> 52:37.130]  this is filled with pee, can I drain this real quick?
[52:38.170 --> 52:38.950]  It's crazy.
[52:39.410 --> 52:40.490]  As someone who
[52:41.030 --> 52:42.430]  successfully potty trained
[52:42.430 --> 52:44.450]  a kid, in this case my
[52:44.450 --> 52:46.550]  daughter, I can
[52:46.550 --> 52:48.630]  confidently say I never got her piss
[52:48.630 --> 52:49.670]  or shit on anyone.
[52:50.410 --> 52:52.530]  I gotta go with Andrew. Your family,
[52:52.970 --> 52:54.410]  who I love dearly,
[52:54.510 --> 52:56.190]  especially your grandparents and your mom,
[52:56.390 --> 52:58.570]  I think the world of them, but the rest
[52:58.570 --> 53:00.230]  of your family, if it wasn't those three,
[53:00.370 --> 53:01.370]  are disgusting.
[53:02.410 --> 53:04.590]  Apparently, when it started dripping
[53:04.590 --> 53:06.490]  on everyone, everyone was making a fuss
[53:06.490 --> 53:08.310]  and getting up, and then the flight attendant
[53:08.310 --> 53:10.530]  came over and was like,
[53:10.570 --> 53:12.250]  uh, whose container
[53:12.250 --> 53:14.310]  is this? And my family
[53:14.310 --> 53:16.410]  member was like, oh, that's ours
[53:16.410 --> 53:18.370]  because it opened. And the
[53:18.370 --> 53:20.430]  flight attendant was like, yep, what's in it?
[53:22.350 --> 53:24.370]  And my family member was like,
[53:24.390 --> 53:26.490]  you're not gonna like this.
[53:28.370 --> 53:29.570]  But it's piss.
[53:31.670 --> 53:32.370]  Apparently they
[53:32.370 --> 53:34.490]  just walked off to get cloths, and I think
[53:34.490 --> 53:36.430]  half my family was dying
[53:36.430 --> 53:38.690]  from embarrassment. Oh my god.
[53:38.930 --> 53:40.210]  I couldn't believe that.
[53:40.310 --> 53:41.950]  I don't know what I would have done
[53:41.950 --> 53:44.410]  if I was in that position. I think
[53:44.410 --> 53:46.010]  I would have just had to curl up.
[53:46.830 --> 53:48.550]  I couldn't handle that level
[53:48.550 --> 53:49.050]  of embarrassment.
[53:50.250 --> 53:52.390]  I don't, yeah, I don't
[53:52.390 --> 53:54.030]  understand. There's so many things.
[53:54.690 --> 53:56.130]  I don't...
[53:56.130 --> 53:58.330]  It's not even that those family members are
[53:58.330 --> 54:00.270]  gross. They're just completely incompetent.
[54:00.670 --> 54:02.370]  I don't understand
[54:02.370 --> 54:03.910]  any of the choices.
[54:03.910 --> 54:05.810]  Dictionary definition of inept.
[54:06.410 --> 54:06.710]  Yes.
[54:08.510 --> 54:09.770]  Just like, the icing
[54:09.770 --> 54:11.950]  on the cake is that they still carried the piss
[54:11.950 --> 54:13.110]  around with them to the cab.
[54:13.650 --> 54:15.870]  At no point do you get this thing
[54:15.870 --> 54:18.010]  as far the fuck away from me and my family
[54:18.010 --> 54:19.690]  as possible. I would put
[54:19.690 --> 54:22.050]  so much distance between myself
[54:22.050 --> 54:23.470]  and that child's toilet.
[54:24.050 --> 54:25.930]  Like, oh my god, dude.
[54:26.430 --> 54:28.050]  That would be like, alright, well, lesson
[54:28.050 --> 54:29.950]  learned here, this is not a travel
[54:29.950 --> 54:30.390]  tool.
[54:31.090 --> 54:31.530]  Oh.
[54:32.710 --> 54:34.210]  It's quite at sea level.
[54:35.250 --> 54:36.130]  You know what? No, you're right.
[54:36.250 --> 54:37.530]  You're right, Geoff. This has changed my opinion.
[54:37.870 --> 54:40.490]  First time, incompetence. The second
[54:40.490 --> 54:41.890]  time, psychotic.
[54:42.130 --> 54:43.070]  Psychotic. This is alarming.
[54:43.070 --> 54:45.850]  I didn't think they expected it to happen on the ground.
[54:46.050 --> 54:48.010]  They didn't expect it to happen once.
[54:48.490 --> 54:50.470]  Once it's already happened when you didn't
[54:50.470 --> 54:52.250]  expect it. It's, all rules
[54:52.250 --> 54:54.370]  go out the window. You can no longer trust your
[54:54.370 --> 54:56.430]  read on the situation. I think you are
[54:56.430 --> 54:58.370]  an incredibly decent human being.
[54:58.970 --> 54:59.990]  One of the best
[54:59.990 --> 55:02.450]  in my life. And I think you must
[55:02.450 --> 55:04.470]  have sapped all of that out of your family.
[55:04.870 --> 55:05.970]  Like, you must have taken
[55:06.530 --> 55:08.370]  all the good, conscientious,
[55:09.410 --> 55:10.750]  polite, all of that
[55:10.750 --> 55:12.630]  element of your British society.
[55:12.910 --> 55:14.430]  You got it all, and you just
[55:14.430 --> 55:16.230]  left them with just, like,
[55:16.290 --> 55:18.230]  American ethics and morals.
[55:18.730 --> 55:20.490]  Oh, man. And I would say
[55:21.050 --> 55:22.590]  Edgar Wright is my favorite director.
[55:22.990 --> 55:24.070]  I wouldn't say that
[55:24.070 --> 55:25.410]  right now, if I were you.
[55:26.150 --> 55:26.910]  After your
[55:26.910 --> 55:29.050]  family just pissed all over him.
[55:29.610 --> 55:31.450]  I really hope it didn't go on him.
[55:31.650 --> 55:33.270]  I need to know.
[55:33.550 --> 55:35.190]  You know what my favorite part of that story is?
[55:35.370 --> 55:37.110]  I am no longer the definitive
[55:37.110 --> 55:39.010]  piss boy of this podcast. That is,
[55:39.210 --> 55:40.710]  the title has been claimed.
[55:42.350 --> 55:43.170]  That's gone.
[55:43.510 --> 55:45.130]  That's done for me. I can't have that.
[55:46.530 --> 55:46.750]  Yeah.
[55:47.330 --> 55:48.770]  That two year old has that.
[55:49.410 --> 55:50.830]  That's off my record now.
[55:52.350 --> 55:53.630]  It's a great day for me.
[55:54.790 --> 55:56.110]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[55:56.810 --> 55:57.450]  Thank you.
[55:57.750 --> 55:58.450]  I will say,
[55:58.710 --> 56:01.190]  I was going to mention this earlier,
[56:01.370 --> 56:03.990]  when I asked you what country you were in at the time.
[56:05.310 --> 56:05.790]  Because
[56:05.790 --> 56:07.550]  I thought it was...
[56:07.550 --> 56:09.810]  But then the story just kept going and kept going
[56:09.810 --> 56:10.490]  and kept going.
[56:11.130 --> 56:13.590]  I will say, because Edgar Wright is British.
[56:13.610 --> 56:15.010]  You're British, right? Yeah.
[56:15.270 --> 56:16.430]  And this happened in England.
[56:16.990 --> 56:19.150]  Irrespective of your family dousing
[56:19.150 --> 56:20.490]  Edgar Wright in urine.
[56:21.590 --> 56:22.110]  Uh...
[56:23.190 --> 56:24.770]  We should test this
[56:24.770 --> 56:26.690]  next time you or we are
[56:26.690 --> 56:28.610]  in England. You might have
[56:28.610 --> 56:30.710]  on home soil, you might
[56:30.710 --> 56:32.870]  have enough gravitas or success
[56:32.870 --> 56:34.590]  or whatever it is. You might be able to
[56:34.590 --> 56:36.450]  summon certain celebrities to you.
[56:37.290 --> 56:38.530]  This could be a skill you have.
[56:38.790 --> 56:40.850]  There's nothing I want more in the world
[56:40.850 --> 56:42.790]  than to be in a place with Gavin
[56:42.790 --> 56:44.690]  and Edgar Wright and to be
[56:44.690 --> 56:46.690]  able to reveal that, hey, remember
[56:46.690 --> 56:48.630]  that time you got pissed on on that plane?
[56:48.630 --> 56:50.190]  He's kind of responsible.
[56:50.530 --> 56:51.710]  This guy, right here.
[56:51.830 --> 56:54.150]  Do you know
[56:54.730 --> 56:56.430]  anybody who knows Edgar Wright?
[56:56.590 --> 56:58.530]  Does Buckley or anybody know Edgar Wright
[56:58.530 --> 57:00.710]  that could find out? Hey, did you get pissed
[57:00.710 --> 57:01.770]  on on a plane recently?
[57:02.770 --> 57:03.850]  DM him, I'm sure.
[57:04.330 --> 57:05.010]  Yeah, do that.
[57:06.370 --> 57:08.510]  Wondering if a member of my family may have
[57:08.510 --> 57:09.590]  peed on you recently.
[57:10.310 --> 57:11.170]  Oh, please.
[57:12.430 --> 57:12.910]  Please.
[57:13.990 --> 57:16.630]  We need to know. We need definitive answers.
[57:17.230 --> 57:18.810]  An attempt needs to be made.
[57:19.910 --> 57:20.030]  Ugh.
[57:20.690 --> 57:22.430]  I could not have been more embarrassed.
[57:24.150 --> 57:24.870]  Through blood.
[57:25.730 --> 57:26.450]  It was...
[57:26.450 --> 57:27.590]  I just...
[57:28.670 --> 57:30.330]  As I was being told the story, I was like,
[57:30.390 --> 57:31.990]  Oh no! And then I was just like,
[57:32.070 --> 57:32.870]  Oh no!
[57:38.030 --> 57:39.370]  Oh, that's so good.
[57:39.830 --> 57:41.310]  Was Meg around for this?
[57:41.790 --> 57:43.330]  She was sat with me. She heard about the story
[57:43.330 --> 57:45.330]  afterwards. I would love to. I gotta go to
[57:45.330 --> 57:47.410]  dinner with y'all soon so I can hear her side of this.
[57:47.910 --> 57:48.570]  Oh, man.
[57:48.730 --> 57:51.550]  Her insights are gonna be fantastic. I can't wait.
[57:53.750 --> 57:55.690]  Oh, I'm tired after listening to that
[57:55.690 --> 57:56.130]  story.
[57:57.010 --> 57:59.310]  That wore me out. I'm so happy.
[57:59.610 --> 58:01.370]  Gavin, that's... Oh my god, you guys
[58:01.370 --> 58:03.410]  realize this is gonna be the next
[58:03.890 --> 58:05.390]  we've already, I think, identified
[58:05.390 --> 58:07.510]  it, but this will be season two of F***face Animated,
[58:07.570 --> 58:09.730]  right? Regulation Animation. Oh, absolutely.
[58:10.510 --> 58:10.950]  100%.
[58:10.950 --> 58:12.290]  Peeing on Edgar Wright.
[58:13.090 --> 58:14.010]  It's top billing.
[58:14.010 --> 58:16.110]  Hearing the story, because I heard the story in the airport
[58:16.110 --> 58:17.730]  and we're all sort of still in the airport,
[58:17.870 --> 58:18.950]  and I was still weighing up like,
[58:19.130 --> 58:22.250]  am I gonna work up the confidence to just say hi to Edgar Wright?
[58:22.970 --> 58:24.250]  And after I heard that story, I was like,
[58:24.790 --> 58:26.110]  I'm gonna let Edgar Wright leave
[58:26.110 --> 58:26.950]  and I hope that
[58:28.910 --> 58:30.250]  we don't cross paths
[58:30.250 --> 58:31.430]  in this way ever again.
[58:32.130 --> 58:33.630]  Oh, that is brilliant.
[58:34.130 --> 58:35.950]  That might be the best story ever
[58:35.950 --> 58:38.110]  told on this podcast, Gavin. That was a great story.
[58:38.650 --> 58:39.990]  I don't think it was the best, but it was
[58:39.990 --> 58:42.170]  significant. I don't know, dude.
[58:42.170 --> 58:43.850]  It's up there, for sure. I agree with Nick.
[58:43.910 --> 58:44.370]  It's up there.
[58:46.410 --> 58:48.310]  For about five solid
[58:48.310 --> 58:50.250]  minutes, I just had to put my head
[58:50.250 --> 58:52.390]  down on my table and just giggled
[58:52.390 --> 58:53.670]  into my arms
[58:53.670 --> 58:56.210]  and was useless. I couldn't do anything
[58:56.210 --> 58:57.730]  but laugh uncontrollably.
[58:59.150 --> 58:59.370]  Ugh.
[59:01.210 --> 59:01.930]  I'm excited.
[59:02.210 --> 59:04.030]  I don't want to tell... I'm sorry, what are you excited about, Andrew?
[59:04.210 --> 59:06.210]  I was gonna say I'm excited because I feel like
[59:06.210 --> 59:08.210]  we're all happy right now, and based off of what you said,
[59:08.270 --> 59:10.230]  the next episode is gonna be very contentious.
[59:10.230 --> 59:12.030]  I'm trying to live in this moment.
[59:12.310 --> 59:14.090]  Yeah, maybe we should live in... maybe
[59:14.090 --> 59:16.270]  revel in this moment. What I was gonna
[59:16.270 --> 59:18.390]  say is, I'll be honest, I think my pastrami
[59:18.390 --> 59:20.270]  story's gonna be a huge letdown after that,
[59:20.330 --> 59:22.610]  so there's really no point in telling it.
[59:25.030 --> 59:26.270]  That was kinda mean,
[59:26.390 --> 59:28.510]  Gavin. You should've closed
[59:28.510 --> 59:30.110]  with that. You should've let... He tried.
[59:30.290 --> 59:31.990]  He tried. Well, I figured next
[59:31.990 --> 59:33.990]  time would be all about the food challenge.
[59:34.670 --> 59:36.610]  That's fair. Do we want to do pastrami
[59:36.610 --> 59:38.510]  to open... I'll open. We'll open
[59:38.510 --> 59:40.390]  with pastrami. It's a really... it's a
[59:40.390 --> 59:42.430]  non-event, I mean, next to that.
[59:42.450 --> 59:44.250]  I'm excited. I have questions. Okay.
[59:44.390 --> 59:46.570]  I feel like this opens all sorts of doors for you
[59:46.570 --> 59:48.370]  food-wise. I need information.
[59:48.790 --> 59:50.810]  Thank you for listening to another episode.
[59:51.230 --> 59:52.410]  Probably what's gonna go down
[59:52.410 --> 59:54.610]  is one of my favorites of all time
[59:54.610 --> 59:56.630]  because of the last 12 minutes
[59:56.630 --> 59:58.590]  or so. Episode of F*** Face.
[59:59.470 --> 01:00:00.550]  Really appreciate the
[01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.390]  support. If you're gonna
[01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.250]  pee in public, do it in a toilet,
[01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:06.470]  and if you do it in a toilet, don't put that toilet above
[01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.450]  your head, and go ahead
[01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.450]  and write in the review if you feel like it.
[01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:12.690]  Keep your urine
[01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.270]  to yourself. Thanks.
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.590]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack
[01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:18.390]  here with a look at next week's episode of
[01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:20.670]  F*** Face. Geoff revisits the P-word.
[01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:22.430]  Let's get specific on letter
[01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:24.330]  food rules. G for Gavin.
[01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:26.250]  Penn gets incredibly lucky.
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.690]  Geoff is incredibly unlucky.
[01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.490]  Is there any way to play Halo
[01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:32.370]  co-op? And once again,
[01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:33.990]  Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:36.190]  All that and more on next week's episode
[01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.110]  of F*** Face.
