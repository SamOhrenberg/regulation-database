[00:15.250 --> 00:22.350]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey,
[00:22.490 --> 00:27.090]  with me as always Gavin Free and Andrew Payton. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is episode
[00:27.090 --> 00:33.410]  126, and to my knowledge, this is the first episode of season 5. That's correct? I think
[00:33.410 --> 00:38.370]  last episode should have been the first episode of season 5. Oh, I thought season 4 ended in
[00:38.370 --> 00:42.510]  that episode. Yeah, I thought we... I don't remember. Didn't we do another one after the
[00:42.510 --> 00:47.370]  last one? Oh, you're right! Hold on a second. Welcome to another episode of the F*** Face
[00:47.370 --> 00:52.030]  podcast. I believe this is episode 126, and correct me if I'm wrong boys, but this is the
[00:52.030 --> 00:58.110]  second episode of season 5. Sounds right to me, Geoff. Yeah, that's exactly correct. You're so
[00:58.110 --> 01:02.610]  smart. Oh, you guys are sweet. Thanks. I know how much you love it when I number and categorize
[01:02.610 --> 01:05.970]  things, so I wanted to be sure I got it right for you. Can I talk about a thing that I'm annoyed
[01:05.970 --> 01:12.170]  about irrationally, but I am annoyed about? Gavin mentioned... Oh, really? What did I do?
[01:12.350 --> 01:17.450]  That's gonna be fascinating. Let's find out what Gavin annoyed you for. Okay, I'm annoyed because Gavin
[01:17.450 --> 01:23.730]  messaged our discord saying his computer won't turn on. Slight problem. Seemed like a big deal. You
[01:23.730 --> 01:29.050]  still f***ing showed up on time. You're annoying. I hate it. I hate that even with your tech issues,
[01:29.090 --> 01:32.610]  you're still on time. I wish I hadn't warned you guys and I would have just shown up on time with,
[01:32.610 --> 01:37.290]  you know, nothing said. But I was getting a bit freaked out. What do you think the chances are,
[01:37.430 --> 01:41.730]  Andrew? Gavin, this is not for you. This is just purely for Andrew, so you can sit quietly. Andrew,
[01:41.870 --> 01:48.370]  what do you think the chances are here that Gavin invented a computer problem that he then instantly
[01:48.370 --> 01:57.950]  fixed to show up on time just to make himself look better so that he may lessen the time that
[01:57.950 --> 02:02.590]  he... it's gonna take him to get back to being an on-time guy. No, I think that's a genius point,
[02:02.590 --> 02:08.010]  I completely agree. He's been late a lot recently, so this is a perfect example of
[02:08.010 --> 02:12.530]  maybe him setting up a scenario which he could still, despite the barriers thrown in his way,
[02:12.670 --> 02:16.670]  appear on time. Let me be honest with you. About eight minutes into my computer not turning on,
[02:16.750 --> 02:21.730]  I did figure out why it wasn't turning on. Really? I have a blu-ray drive that if it's on,
[02:22.690 --> 02:27.650]  when I turn the computer on, it tries to boot from a disk. And I didn't hear the fact that it
[02:27.650 --> 02:32.030]  was going like... and as soon as I turned that off, the computer came on. But I didn't figure...
[02:32.030 --> 02:38.030]  yeah, it still took nine minutes to turn on. So, in essence, Andrew and I were right.
[02:38.770 --> 02:43.830]  I would say, subconsciously, you were right. Okay, there's nothing wrong with that.
[02:43.850 --> 02:48.450]  I'll take that. That's a victory. You're talking about that annoyance? I have a thing that's been
[02:48.450 --> 02:54.410]  driving me crazy in my bedroom where when I turn my TV off with the Apple remote, which is all I
[02:54.410 --> 02:59.850]  use because it's got an Apple TV connected to it, the TV turns off. And then anywhere between 20
[02:59.850 --> 03:04.650]  and 45 seconds later, it is random, it will just turn back on again. And then I have to turn it
[03:04.650 --> 03:11.870]  off a second time. But it happens 100% of the time. The TV in the bedroom is a two-turn-off TV.
[03:12.250 --> 03:17.390]  I don't know why or how it started all at once in the middle of like... it's been there. It's
[03:17.390 --> 03:21.710]  been on that wall working fine for, I don't know, six months, a year, however long since I hung it.
[03:21.710 --> 03:26.970]  And the motherfucker just, maybe like three weeks ago, just decided, no, I'm a two-turn-off TV now.
[03:27.310 --> 03:31.650]  And it sucks. Is it that the Apple TV has already slept? And when you're hitting it, you're turning
[03:31.650 --> 03:36.610]  off the TV, but you're actually turning the Apple TV on? No, because I'm doing it like from an app,
[03:36.770 --> 03:40.950]  like I'm watching an episode. I'm like watching SportsCenter via the Apple TV. It's all
[03:40.950 --> 03:46.910]  operating. And I'm just like, I have no idea. My behavior hasn't changed at all. Only the TV's
[03:46.910 --> 03:55.050]  behavior. Oh, uh, anyway. So what are we annoyed at Andrew about? Oh, uh, well, you know, uh,
[03:55.210 --> 04:01.130]  there's a photo, uh, you know, we just had the highly successful, uh, I would say highly
[04:01.130 --> 04:07.790]  successful alpha bet, and everybody seemed to love it. Uh, this is one of the photos, uh, that,
[04:07.830 --> 04:16.290]  uh, Andrew posted showing his desk. As we all know, uh, Gavin and I love to pour over Andrew's
[04:16.290 --> 04:23.730]  any, any image we can get of Andrew's apartment or home or secret place you live, uh, so that we
[04:23.730 --> 04:28.810]  can find any, like, inkling of, of, uh, like a secret data about the bizarre way you live your
[04:28.810 --> 04:33.910]  life. And, uh, so I was looking over that picture with a fine tooth comb because there's so much to
[04:33.910 --> 04:38.590]  look at. And that's when I noticed, and then apparently every member on the site noticed as
[04:38.590 --> 04:44.610]  well, you have a thousand fucking pencils on your desk. What kind of, what kind of, uh, like,
[04:45.710 --> 04:51.990]  power move are you pulling on us here? You've literally, Mr. Anti-Pencil has a, Nick's, Nick
[04:51.990 --> 04:56.830]  nailed it, a treasure trove of pencils. And then I got to thinking, not only are you flaunting these
[04:56.830 --> 05:02.910]  pencils just right in our face, you put them in a porta potty, which was a, a torture device of
[05:02.910 --> 05:08.350]  your design directed at me. So I feel like it's like a double fuck you coming my way. We both saw
[05:08.350 --> 05:13.230]  this as a multi-layered power play. No, no, no, no. Yeah. First of all, porta potty is maybe the
[05:13.230 --> 05:17.570]  nicest gift I've ever given anyone. There's no attack as part of a porta potty. You didn't have
[05:17.570 --> 05:22.770]  a toilet. I provided you a toilet. I don't see why there's any issue with what I did. Second of
[05:22.770 --> 05:28.830]  all, I've never protested against pencils as a, as a, as a tool to use them. You can never have
[05:28.830 --> 05:34.270]  enough pencils. Who doesn't love a pencil? I just, uh, no. Wait, did you just admit that that's a
[05:34.970 --> 05:40.630]  Yeah. It's not, it's not a writing utensil. That's a, that's a pencil. Well, I think you
[05:40.630 --> 05:45.290]  could call that a pencil. You can call it all sorts of things. Interesting. Yeah. Where did
[05:45.290 --> 05:49.950]  you get the pencils and why do you have so many? Where did I get the pencils? I bought, I bought a
[05:49.950 --> 05:56.470]  thing of, uh, pencils from Amazon, like a giant pack of it. And I was going to do it. That was
[05:56.470 --> 06:01.250]  going to be my episode 100 thing that I decided not to do for some reason. I was going to instigate
[06:01.250 --> 06:07.650]  the audience. I was going to make a whole video of like having the pencils, grinding them down,
[06:08.190 --> 06:12.230]  getting ready to like, make them into a pancake, like cooking a pancake for it.
[06:12.390 --> 06:17.690]  And then going like, nah, and then just eating some hotcakes from McDonald's using my great hack.
[06:17.870 --> 06:22.330]  And then I was going to film a video of me walking the pencils to the garbage and just
[06:22.330 --> 06:27.050]  throwing them in there. And I never did that. So instead I just put them in my porta potty mug
[06:27.050 --> 06:31.090]  and they're, they're there. Were you worried about the backlash of such an act?
[06:31.410 --> 06:35.510]  I don't remember. There was something that happened at that time that I just was like,
[06:35.570 --> 06:39.210]  you know what? I don't, I think maybe it was the fact that episode 100 felt like it was
[06:39.210 --> 06:44.250]  going to be a fun thing that we're celebrating. I was like, I maybe don't want to try to annoy
[06:44.250 --> 06:49.350]  everybody. I can't remember what you did for episode 100. I didn't do anything. I had every,
[06:49.450 --> 06:52.870]  I had all these things planned and I didn't ultimately do any of them because they would
[06:52.870 --> 06:59.730]  either be against Geoff, which was not a great idea at the time, or it would instigate the
[06:59.730 --> 07:04.030]  audience, which I didn't want to do because I wanted 100 to be like a fun thing. Interesting.
[07:04.770 --> 07:09.350]  Yeah. Interesting. Okay. And plus I'm kind of glad I didn't cause nothing could top what Geoff did.
[07:09.590 --> 07:14.590]  He stole the show. It's a great thing you did for 100. The tattoos? The tattoos. Oh right,
[07:14.690 --> 07:18.830]  I did. I was sitting here trying, I was racking my fucking brain trying to remember what I did
[07:18.830 --> 07:23.590]  on episode 100. You looking like a mermaid getting, getting tattoos on you. It's fantastic.
[07:24.230 --> 07:29.690]  Completely forgot I did that. Oh man. Do you have a, do you own a pencil sharpener?
[07:30.530 --> 07:34.430]  Oh yeah, I do. I bought one at the same time. I have an electric pencil sharpener. I was going
[07:34.430 --> 07:40.030]  to use that to grind them down. I think instead of grinding those things down, I think you should
[07:40.030 --> 07:45.750]  use each and every pencil to it's like, use it down to the nub. And then as soon as you finish
[07:45.750 --> 07:51.950]  one, uh, grab the next one and try to make it your life's goal to draw out all of those pencils.
[07:52.190 --> 07:55.310]  I like that idea a lot. I think I'm going to, I'm going to do that. They're going to get a lot
[07:55.310 --> 08:02.170]  of use for, uh, something related to MVP coming up. So maybe I'll knock one or two of them out.
[08:02.390 --> 08:05.030]  How long does it take? How many, how many strokes is in a pencil?
[08:05.910 --> 08:11.350]  How many strokes? Yeah. That's a great question. Let me Google that.
[08:11.350 --> 08:14.370]  Yeah. Like how far does a pencil, like will a pencil go a mile?
[08:14.910 --> 08:19.330]  Like how many licks to the center of a Tootsie Pop? Have we done that research for pencils?
[08:19.430 --> 08:27.130]  Like how many strokes is the average pencil? Uh, oh Lord. Uh, it's been established that the
[08:27.130 --> 08:34.610]  average pencil has enough graphite to write about 45,000 words. I could do two lists. Plus some.
[08:38.150 --> 08:42.270]  Maybe if you're actually writing the list with a pencil, you wouldn't have as many repeats.
[08:42.710 --> 08:47.270]  No, I would just, I would have probably more because I couldn't easily search it and I'd
[08:47.270 --> 08:52.350]  just be more miserable. I think, I think as a test, nobody could read my list if I did it by
[08:52.350 --> 08:58.630]  hand. Do you have bad handwriting? Oh, the worst. Terrible. You think my drawing is bad? Oh my God.
[08:59.570 --> 09:07.490]  Jesus Christ. I, I wonder if you, as a test, just wrote the word word 45,000 times with that
[09:07.490 --> 09:13.170]  pencil. Uh, see if it like, see how close you are to finishing it. Yeah. Kind of like, uh,
[09:13.190 --> 09:18.510]  kind of like every punishment I had in school, actually. Yeah. Like the Bart Simpson chalkboard.
[09:18.690 --> 09:23.410]  Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'll try that. Maybe next time we record, I'll have a sheet. Probably not.
[09:23.630 --> 09:26.110]  Probably not going to do that, but I'll, I like the idea.
[09:26.670 --> 09:31.790]  Have I told you guys that since when the last couple of, well, maybe like six weeks,
[09:31.790 --> 09:38.810]  I've had two major anxiety dreams about missing dinners. Really? Because of your lightness? Yeah.
[09:39.150 --> 09:46.730]  Like I keep, it's because I felt it. Like I felt Geoff's text in, in the Home Depot. And I just
[09:46.730 --> 09:53.650]  thought, ah, like, ah, I'm so screwed. And that feeling has, has not yet left me. And I, and I,
[09:53.650 --> 09:57.170]  I just get that anxious feeling. And I've woken up from that twice since.
[09:58.150 --> 10:00.970]  Is your greatest fear going to be when those dreams feel normal to you,
[10:00.990 --> 10:04.070]  when you've truly become a man of lightness? I just shake them off.
[10:04.350 --> 10:09.270]  Yeah. They're no longer anxiety. When I can shrug that off in my dream. I think that's the goal.
[10:10.790 --> 10:14.850]  Don't worry. As soon as you're able to do that, there'll be an Edgar Wright dream waiting in the
[10:14.850 --> 10:22.990]  wings. Oh man. Dude. The funny thing about that to me is it was, it was great content for the
[10:22.990 --> 10:27.570]  podcast. I always, like I said, at the time, I almost preferred it that way. Uh, because I've
[10:27.570 --> 10:30.850]  had dinner with you a million times. We'll have dinner a million more times. It was more memorable
[10:30.850 --> 10:34.790]  than the dinner we probably would have had. Yeah. I, I tell you, I guarantee you, you go to that
[10:34.790 --> 10:38.210]  dinner. You, you and Meg show up. I can't tell you one thing about that night today.
[10:39.670 --> 10:43.430]  Completely unremarkable. I'm sure you have a lovely time, but it's, it fades into the,
[10:43.490 --> 10:47.530]  it fades in amongst the other 10,000 double dates and dinners that we've had together.
[10:48.070 --> 10:54.890]  Uh, but I, I don't know how to tell you, Andrew, I, I, this is how pro Gavin I am these days.
[10:55.370 --> 10:58.950]  How I just, how much I love all of you guys. I'm just so full of love right now.
[10:59.170 --> 11:04.890]  I was at work yesterday to do another podcast, right? And in that podcast, somebody mentioned,
[11:04.970 --> 11:08.850]  uh, stay away from age. They're doing lasso. So they're probably pretty, uh, it's pretty intense
[11:08.850 --> 11:12.410]  and smelly in there. And as soon as I heard they're playing lasso, I thought, well, Gavin's
[11:12.410 --> 11:17.870]  gotta be involved in that. I ran over, everybody said hi to me. I, Joe, Michael, everybody. I,
[11:18.010 --> 11:22.990]  I think maybe Alfredo, I ignored them all. I ran over to give Gavin a hug and a big kiss on his
[11:22.990 --> 11:26.090]  head. And I didn't even think about it. I just kissed him on his head. And then I was walking
[11:26.090 --> 11:30.590]  away. Gavin goes, I got a kiss. And I was like, I kissed him? I was just so excited to see him.
[11:30.890 --> 11:34.730]  You came in and we were like, Hey, and then I, you kissed my forehead and I was like, Oh,
[11:34.770 --> 11:39.950]  I got a kiss. And then you were gone. And then we beat the level.
[11:39.950 --> 11:44.910]  That was my good luck. Should we talk about lasso? A different lasso that occurred?
[11:45.470 --> 11:48.850]  Because that, that brought me a lot of joy last week. I didn't even think about bringing it up
[11:48.850 --> 11:52.410]  in this context, but you've said it made me know what you're talking about. You don't know what
[11:52.410 --> 11:58.750]  you're a key part of this. So a very long time ago, Gavin and his friend, Dan, tried to get
[11:59.210 --> 12:03.170]  the Halo 2 lasso. I don't know if you want to queue up the photos because they're fantastic.
[12:03.510 --> 12:07.710]  They tried to get the Halo 2 lasso achievement, which is to complete every level of Halo 2 and
[12:07.710 --> 12:13.410]  lasso in the playlist. Now they did it in co-op. There's a weird issue with Halo 2 where there is
[12:13.410 --> 12:17.590]  one mission at the start that you have to do in single player. They will not let you do in co-op.
[12:17.810 --> 12:21.530]  So they went through the entire game and the achievement never popped. And they realized
[12:21.530 --> 12:27.010]  it's because they didn't do this one level and you can't just like go do it later. Like you have to
[12:27.010 --> 12:31.890]  do it in the correct sequence. Yeah. I have a photo of the moment we discovered this, popping it in
[12:31.890 --> 12:39.970]  now. That is a picture of Dan puzzled at why he didn't get the achievement. So because that
[12:39.970 --> 12:45.790]  happened, this is before we did f***face, I felt bad for Gavin. This is 2019. This is something
[12:45.790 --> 12:50.210]  that I've kind of considered doing myself. This will be motivation. I'll do it with one of my
[12:50.210 --> 12:55.250]  friends. We'll get to the end and then I'll let Gavin know, hey, I have two checkpoints.
[12:55.670 --> 13:00.090]  You can do it with one of us and Dan can do with the other person. It's going to be great. I think
[13:00.090 --> 13:05.590]  did we talk about the intricacies of why it didn't work? Yeah, I just explained it, I believe.
[13:06.110 --> 13:12.030]  But all we had to do was then play the first cutscene and first level and then beat the
[13:12.030 --> 13:16.430]  playlist again. But you can't start from the end of the playlist. You have to start and play the
[13:16.430 --> 13:21.890]  entire game again. But all you really need is for the game to see you click over the final boss
[13:21.890 --> 13:27.830]  and the final level. With all the other levels complete. Yeah. So I, with a friend, go through
[13:27.830 --> 13:34.470]  Halo 2 LASA, get to the last one, reach out to Gavin. We coordinate. It takes us a few hours,
[13:34.610 --> 13:40.330]  but we do it. We complete Halo 2 LASA. We both get the achievement. Now it's just my friend and Dan
[13:40.330 --> 13:44.690]  need to sync up somehow. They don't, they have no connection. It seems very unlikely to me that this
[13:44.690 --> 13:51.170]  will ever happen. But this is the thing. I think like two months after. Yeah. So we're 2019. Yeah.
[13:51.850 --> 13:56.470]  Last week, because Gavin and I talked about it sort of recently, how it's funny that my friend
[13:56.470 --> 14:00.230]  still has that checkpoint and has never gotten the achievement. And Dan still also hasn't gotten
[14:00.230 --> 14:06.530]  it. Gavin texted me. What days are your, is your friend available? Like in the next five days,
[14:06.550 --> 14:11.030]  does your friend have an availability? Well, first I was like, does he still have that
[14:11.030 --> 14:15.950]  checkpoint? Cause I thought the chances that this checkpoint would have held for three years.
[14:16.030 --> 14:20.910]  Now, let me explain the joy that I got when I received that message, that friend,
[14:20.910 --> 14:28.390]  and I love them. They're terrible at Halo. They spent most of that experience not playing. Well,
[14:28.430 --> 14:34.890]  I dragged this through level by level. They're awful. They, uh, they're the person that they,
[14:35.110 --> 14:39.690]  they are the person that I did the applesauce races with where I wasn't eating the applesauce
[14:39.690 --> 14:43.170]  and they would just chow it down. They are, they're an idiot and I love them. They're
[14:43.170 --> 14:48.050]  terrible at Halo too. They're fantastic. Um, so when I saw that text, I thought, Oh,
[14:48.050 --> 14:54.030]  this is my friend, the applesauce guy. He's so bad at this. This is going to be a disaster. I'm
[14:54.030 --> 14:59.630]  so excited. I rushed over to message him. Hey, what's your availability for the next five days?
[15:00.350 --> 15:04.730]  We sorted it out. We got it organized. It was like Monday, whatever. It doesn't really matter,
[15:04.910 --> 15:08.890]  but we, but they found a time. And for the next, that was like two days in the future. They're
[15:08.890 --> 15:12.690]  going to do it. There were moments throughout those next few days where I would just light up
[15:12.690 --> 15:18.490]  in joy, knowing the pain that they would be going through. He's terrible at Halo.
[15:18.970 --> 15:24.250]  And Dan was excited to finally get closure on this achievement that he put in probably
[15:25.090 --> 15:31.010]  40 hours into maybe. Easily. Yeah. I'll let you take it from here, Gavin, because I sadly was not
[15:31.010 --> 15:35.670]  able to watch these runs. Tell me what was the experience like watching the play? I realized
[15:35.670 --> 15:46.210]  very quickly that this person was no good at Halo. Because Iron is on. It just means that when,
[15:46.530 --> 15:52.990]  when your friend died, they both got reset. And I just never hear this side of Dan,
[15:53.190 --> 15:58.510]  but Dan was like, Oh, don't worry about it. No, we'll, we've got this. He was like being
[15:59.270 --> 15:59.710]  motivational.
[16:04.130 --> 16:05.010]  Go ahead.
[16:07.130 --> 16:12.250]  I was just gonna say my friend has weird. That was the weirdest awkward. That was the worst
[16:12.250 --> 16:18.170]  talk over we've ever had in the hundred by far. I mean, I want to note it to cut it out,
[16:18.290 --> 16:23.170]  but Jesus Christ, what happened? That was like, that's so funny. One thing that's great about
[16:23.170 --> 16:27.750]  this podcast is we very rarely ever have those moments. And whereas every other podcast I've
[16:27.750 --> 16:34.490]  ever done remotely, they're constant. But man stepped in that hard. Yeah, the problem is that
[16:34.490 --> 16:38.610]  was there was too much respect there. There was too much kindness. We both wanted to give the
[16:38.610 --> 16:43.250]  right away. We both were committed to Yeah, it was it was that was the issue. I was just I don't
[16:43.250 --> 16:47.450]  even remember what I was gonna Oh, they have no patience. They die all the time. They just run out
[16:47.450 --> 16:51.830]  and die. They're really bad at just waiting. So that was one bit where they tried probably 25
[16:51.830 --> 16:56.930]  times to make it. They're basically trying to skip a segment with tons of enemies. And Dan
[16:56.930 --> 17:01.950]  made it like he performed this jump that he'd been trying so many times. And it was like,
[17:02.070 --> 17:07.490]  Oh, we got it. We got it. Oh, okay. Okay. Don't die. Don't die. We've got this. And they slowly
[17:07.490 --> 17:11.310]  edge through the rest of the level. Very meticulously taken out. Jackal snipers,
[17:11.370 --> 17:19.070]  all this stuff. And I just hear Dan going, Oh, no, don't worry that we could do.
[17:19.630 --> 17:27.770]  Your friend is clearly running again. There you go. They get all the way to the end. All they
[17:27.770 --> 17:33.630]  have to do is do the glitch with Johnson. If you've done Lassa, you've probably cloned Johnson
[17:33.630 --> 17:38.970]  a few times because it's pretty much impossible to beat the game without doing this exploit where
[17:38.970 --> 17:44.510]  you have to drop a specter into the final boss room at perfect time. They get all the way to that
[17:44.510 --> 17:50.190]  point and Dan messes up the specter part. So they drop into the final boss without the specter,
[17:50.290 --> 17:56.550]  which means you can't clone Johnson. They have to restart the entire level again. This is their
[17:56.550 --> 18:03.070]  hours in at this point. They go through the entire level again. They do it. They do the glitch.
[18:03.330 --> 18:11.750]  They pull it off. Hold on. My shit's too powerful. I will say that's one of the things.
[18:11.750 --> 18:17.830]  Why don't we get this freaking nitro or whatever? What made me so excited was because when Gavin and
[18:17.830 --> 18:22.990]  I did it, the glitch to get Johnson in to bring the specter into the room is kind of difficult
[18:22.990 --> 18:27.790]  if you're not experienced with it. It took us, I want to say three attempts. So we had to go
[18:27.790 --> 18:31.450]  through the level three times at that point. I was like, oh, they're gonna definitely fuck up
[18:31.450 --> 18:34.490]  that specter glitch. This is gonna be great. They're gonna have to do it multiple times.
[18:34.950 --> 18:40.950]  It's gonna be a massive headache. I've put an image in. That was 270 kilobytes. I've put an image in
[18:40.950 --> 18:56.050]  Slack. Okay. It's the same image. It's the same image three years apart. Oh my God. He didn't get
[18:56.050 --> 19:03.270]  the achievement. I guess at some point in the interim time, Dan somehow lost all of his progress
[19:03.270 --> 19:10.390]  in the lasso playlist. Like all of his mid progress for any playlist was reset. So he now has the first
[19:10.390 --> 19:15.670]  cut scene complete the second level armory and the final level and everything else in the middle
[19:15.670 --> 19:21.750]  is missing. And the best part about it is that your friend got the achievement.
[19:22.790 --> 19:29.430]  All that happened is Dan helped Andrew's friend get an achievement for three hours.
[19:29.430 --> 19:39.990]  And he walks away from the whole thing. He doesn't care about that achievement at all.
[19:40.130 --> 19:49.150]  That means nothing to him. Apparently the guy was like, Oh, thanks. Yeah. He has one of the
[19:49.150 --> 19:54.910]  hardest achievements in the entire game. Dan who has now pretty much played the whole game and the
[19:54.910 --> 20:01.230]  level twice still has nothing to show for it. I think arguably the best part, and correct me
[20:01.230 --> 20:05.790]  if I'm wrong in this, Gavin, even if Dan finishes all the levels, he still doesn't have credit for
[20:05.790 --> 20:10.570]  because of that glitch. He still would then need to beat the final level again for the pump.
[20:10.790 --> 20:14.990]  He can't get that achievement without playing that level for a third time.
[20:15.290 --> 20:21.370]  We couldn't believe it. I was just in tears in front of the TV and the exact same post
[20:21.370 --> 20:26.590]  trying to figure out what went wrong again. Did you recognize instantly that it was the same photo?
[20:29.290 --> 20:34.470]  Well, it's a screenshot from a video and I remember I've taken the same video twice.
[20:34.570 --> 20:39.070]  So I was like, it seems really familiar. So is he going to try again in three years?
[20:39.770 --> 20:45.010]  I think so. I'm always feeling guilty enough to the point where I'll go through it with him again.
[20:45.230 --> 20:49.530]  I feel like he really deserves it at this point. That's pretty unfortunate. Yeah.
[20:52.030 --> 20:57.630]  Oh man. It's the worst lasso too, but aside from like Halo 5, it's pretty bad. It's terrible.
[20:57.930 --> 21:05.130]  How is Halo 5 lasso going? Oh, awful. Absolutely horrendous. What makes you say that?
[21:08.270 --> 21:12.750]  We put out a video the other day that was three hours and 40 minutes long. We didn't even do the
[21:12.750 --> 21:18.750]  level. We just got stuck and stopped. What level are you on right now? How far into it are you?
[21:18.750 --> 21:24.810]  We just beat level four. Oh, there's like 12 or 13 levels? There's 12 playable.
[21:25.350 --> 21:29.990]  Oh wow, there's 12? I thought there were 10. Wow. You're not even halfway. That's great.
[21:30.290 --> 21:34.110]  No, there's not even an achievement for it or anything. Nope. There's no reason to do it.
[21:34.430 --> 21:37.670]  I know they said they wouldn't do it. Nothing would make me happier if they had Halo 5
[21:37.670 --> 21:39.970]  to the Master Chief collection with a lasso.
[21:42.570 --> 21:45.290]  Right when you're about to finish that achievement list, you've
[21:46.690 --> 21:49.410]  698 and they drop a Halo 5 lasso into the mix.
[21:50.150 --> 21:54.470]  Eric, can I get Shitty Discord to let me put up bigger files?
[21:54.930 --> 22:00.930]  Yeah, I'm getting it right now. I just feel like two years in, we deserve it.
[22:01.030 --> 22:03.010]  Right. I just said that we were going to do it,
[22:03.130 --> 22:05.390]  but we can keep having the conversation on the episode if you want.
[22:06.650 --> 22:09.070]  Eric, I love you. Sorry for providing a little bit of extra.
[22:09.870 --> 22:12.510]  If I were in the room with you right now, I'd kiss you on the forehead, Eric.
[22:12.510 --> 22:15.670]  Thank you so much. I'm already getting it. I'm getting the card.
[22:15.930 --> 22:19.870]  I was going to do it. Here's the thing. I was going to do it during the episode,
[22:20.070 --> 22:25.450]  and then I thought, I don't trust Discord at all to not drop everything
[22:25.450 --> 22:30.650]  and make that be a big thing in the middle of the recording by doing whatever this Nitro boost is.
[22:31.090 --> 22:33.790]  So I'm waiting until we're done, and then I'll take care of it,
[22:33.830 --> 22:34.930]  and then we should have it for the year.
[22:35.930 --> 22:39.810]  That thing makes me feel more like a chump than thinking an image will land,
[22:39.810 --> 22:41.350]  and then I just get like an F you.
[22:42.430 --> 22:46.430]  No, no, I understand. I totally, I completely agree with you.
[22:46.990 --> 22:53.230]  Here's the thing. I hate Discord. I genuinely think out of every VoIP solution
[22:53.970 --> 22:58.150]  that's ever been a thing on the internet, Discord is the fucking dirt worst.
[22:58.330 --> 23:07.230]  I hate, I hate, I am every day just hanging on to life because I'm trying to outlive Discord.
[23:07.230 --> 23:14.990]  I hate it so much. I hate, I hate Discord passionately.
[23:15.350 --> 23:20.330]  I think it's just the bottom of the barrel, but because it's purple and gray,
[23:20.670 --> 23:23.830]  everyone gets tricked into thinking it's a cool little thing.
[23:24.090 --> 23:26.610]  I hate it. I hate it so much.
[23:31.370 --> 23:37.710]  I was gonna say, at some point today, I think everybody needs to start being nice to Eric,
[23:37.870 --> 23:41.050]  because I'm getting the sense that he's on edge and he might crack soon.
[23:41.330 --> 23:42.130]  Eric's burned out.
[23:42.530 --> 23:48.390]  I don't know why, because the goddamn San Diego Goose fucking showed up last night
[23:48.390 --> 23:50.130]  and cursed the Dodgers.
[23:50.370 --> 23:52.430]  Yeah, I love the Goose. I'm a big fan of the Goose.
[23:53.030 --> 23:55.070]  Have you guys seen the Goose? I'm a big fan of the Goose.
[23:55.070 --> 23:55.750]  No.
[23:56.050 --> 24:00.330]  A fucking Goose showed up in the... so the baseball playoffs are right now.
[24:00.750 --> 24:03.470]  It's Eric's team, the San Diego Dodgers against...
[24:03.470 --> 24:04.790]  What? The fuck are you saying?
[24:05.330 --> 24:08.030]  Sorry, Eric's team, the San Diego Padres against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[24:08.410 --> 24:09.790]  I'm obviously rooting for the Dodgers.
[24:09.970 --> 24:11.630]  And in like the fifth or sixth inning,
[24:11.970 --> 24:16.950]  a Goose just showed up right behind second base and just parked and wouldn't leave.
[24:17.130 --> 24:19.910]  And they played for a while, which I thought was wild.
[24:20.370 --> 24:23.450]  I think they let Gavin Lux hit while that Goose was sitting there.
[24:23.450 --> 24:25.270]  And then they went to a commercial break and the Goose was gone.
[24:26.690 --> 24:30.010]  I'm a big fan of everyone photoshopping hats on the Goose.
[24:30.250 --> 24:30.970]  I'm a big Goose guy.
[24:30.970 --> 24:31.390]  That's great.
[24:32.790 --> 24:35.110]  I just I think the Goose is really fantastic.
[24:35.710 --> 24:37.670]  Topps now, Geoff, do you know about the Topps card?
[24:38.310 --> 24:38.590]  No.
[24:39.110 --> 24:42.150]  Topps now has released... I'm going to link to a tweet here.
[24:42.590 --> 24:46.430]  Sorry, this is a real sort of side tangent for like the rest of this episode.
[24:46.850 --> 24:51.530]  For 24 hours, there is a digital Goose card that Topps has released.
[24:52.010 --> 24:52.370]  Aww.
[24:54.930 --> 24:56.430]  I want it signed by the Goose.
[24:56.550 --> 24:57.110]  I want it physical.
[24:57.390 --> 24:58.430]  That's what I'm saying.
[24:58.750 --> 24:59.710]  I think it's a good idea.
[24:59.910 --> 25:00.110]  We should.
[25:00.290 --> 25:01.270]  This Goose is pretty cool.
[25:01.590 --> 25:02.290]  I'm a big fan.
[25:03.290 --> 25:06.870]  Mostly, I'm on edge just because of the baseballs in general.
[25:07.050 --> 25:09.250]  Not baseball, the sport, but baseballs.
[25:09.310 --> 25:11.550]  Yeah, that's why you're on edge.
[25:12.310 --> 25:14.090]  Yeah, it has a lot to do with that.
[25:14.470 --> 25:17.910]  So, you know, we we had a bunch of people show up to buy.
[25:18.090 --> 25:19.710]  We only had a couple hundred to sell.
[25:21.350 --> 25:25.150]  Unfortunately, we oversold by six, I think is the number.
[25:25.290 --> 25:30.370]  So six people, six people bought baseballs and then got like a refund because I don't know.
[25:31.130 --> 25:32.310]  Because no system is perfect.
[25:32.370 --> 25:33.330]  And there was a glitch or whatever.
[25:33.450 --> 25:34.010]  Maybe who knows?
[25:34.070 --> 25:36.230]  Maybe they bought it at the same microsecond or something.
[25:36.690 --> 25:40.410]  But so when we when we recognized that, I asked Eric to get in touch with those people,
[25:40.410 --> 25:41.030]  which he did.
[25:41.050 --> 25:41.510]  And I appreciate.
[25:41.950 --> 25:45.070]  And we're just going to hit six balls and then we'll just mail them free balls.
[25:45.290 --> 25:47.190]  So not only did they get a refund, but they'll get the ball.
[25:47.190 --> 25:48.930]  Yeah, we're doing a special ball.
[25:49.070 --> 25:49.850]  Make good, Gavin.
[25:50.010 --> 25:51.750]  We've made good and now we're making good.
[25:52.010 --> 25:52.970]  We're going to make make good.
[25:53.230 --> 25:55.650]  It's crazy that it didn't work out like you said it would.
[25:55.910 --> 26:01.830]  I mean, it did because they oversold and got refunded and everything went up on time.
[26:02.030 --> 26:04.110]  And I don't know what else to fucking do.
[26:04.350 --> 26:07.370]  Well, I do know what else to do, because when the baseballs come out,
[26:07.390 --> 26:09.430]  I've already told Geoff I don't have anything to do with them.
[26:09.750 --> 26:12.910]  Like, I'll hit them and I'll I'll get them to the people who need them.
[26:13.010 --> 26:14.450]  I'm done with it at that point.
[26:14.550 --> 26:15.710]  Everyone else can do baseballs.
[26:15.710 --> 26:19.930]  I was a I was afraid I was afraid Eric was going to quit that day.
[26:20.010 --> 26:25.490]  He was I was I was doing a lot of like really nice talking to Eric about what a good job
[26:25.490 --> 26:26.270]  he does as a producer.
[26:26.410 --> 26:29.810]  A lot of like I was doing a lot of like talking off ledge conversations.
[26:30.050 --> 26:31.590]  I was surprised the refund even took place.
[26:31.690 --> 26:35.530]  Like, how does that surely we could have just gone and hit six more quickly without it being
[26:35.530 --> 26:35.910]  a thing.
[26:36.150 --> 26:36.430]  Right.
[26:36.670 --> 26:42.790]  But that's what happens when we have other departments that are just sort of doing stuff.
[26:43.250 --> 26:43.610]  Yeah.
[26:43.730 --> 26:44.790]  I mean, just talk to us.
[26:44.870 --> 26:45.150]  We're here.
[26:45.150 --> 26:45.490]  Exactly.
[26:46.290 --> 26:47.270]  But that's OK.
[26:47.750 --> 26:48.610]  We gotta sort it out.
[26:48.870 --> 26:49.770]  Because I worked with them.
[26:50.030 --> 26:51.090]  I've contacted the people.
[26:51.350 --> 26:52.550]  We're hitting six more baseballs.
[26:52.830 --> 26:55.850]  And that just means we have to go hit more baseballs again soon.
[26:56.190 --> 26:57.730]  But first, we have to shoot more.
[26:57.730 --> 26:59.110]  Does it do and do a monkey movie?
[26:59.650 --> 27:01.050]  Don't worry, there's a list.
[27:02.210 --> 27:06.070]  I and speaking of which, there's also I got to say, you know, I was telling you guys,
[27:06.110 --> 27:07.450]  I think my finger might be broken.
[27:07.610 --> 27:08.630]  I don't know if I told you that or not.
[27:09.650 --> 27:11.370]  I'm pretty sure my finger is broken.
[27:11.490 --> 27:14.970]  So it's going to be hard for me to hit baseballs, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[27:15.150 --> 27:16.470]  From the baseballs it broke?
[27:18.070 --> 27:18.790]  No, no.
[27:18.870 --> 27:20.970]  I picked up some groceries and my finger.
[27:21.270 --> 27:22.810]  So I do a weird position.
[27:22.930 --> 27:23.170]  Yeah.
[27:23.170 --> 27:24.310]  And I thought I was fine.
[27:24.410 --> 27:25.590]  I thought I just like pulled a muscle or something.
[27:25.670 --> 27:31.510]  But this week it started to to just like like hurt in like a searingly blinding way.
[27:31.710 --> 27:32.870]  So I'm going to deal with that.
[27:33.250 --> 27:34.510]  I'm gonna deal with that next week.
[27:34.850 --> 27:38.310]  But, you know, I'll just like I just won't be able to swing for the fences,
[27:38.310 --> 27:39.550]  but I'm sure I can still hit.
[27:41.490 --> 27:43.110]  Yeah, I hope it doesn't.
[27:43.190 --> 27:44.570]  I'm tired of getting older.
[27:44.570 --> 27:46.190]  I'm tired of my body breaking down.
[27:47.130 --> 27:48.990]  Am I sprained ankle from the bike wreck?
[27:49.230 --> 27:50.370]  You know, I thought my knee was worse.
[27:50.690 --> 27:51.710]  My ankle still hurts.
[27:51.870 --> 27:53.770]  And if anything, it hurts more now.
[27:54.410 --> 27:55.290]  How's the rash?
[27:56.090 --> 27:58.290]  Uh, I mean, I think it's...
[27:58.290 --> 28:00.330]  No, I was hoping it would just be gone.
[28:00.510 --> 28:01.950]  I was hoping that'd be a win for you.
[28:02.070 --> 28:03.890]  I'm still taking medicine for it.
[28:05.210 --> 28:07.990]  The infected area is still discolored,
[28:08.150 --> 28:11.010]  but I was told that that could last up to like a year.
[28:11.790 --> 28:13.410]  Oh, so you have a stained crotch?
[28:13.410 --> 28:15.070]  I have like a stained thigh.
[28:15.290 --> 28:18.110]  Yeah, so I'm still putting medicine on it, but it doesn't itch or anything.
[28:18.190 --> 28:19.510]  It hasn't itched in probably a month.
[28:19.790 --> 28:21.550]  It's just I'm just following through with the medicine.
[28:21.650 --> 28:22.350]  So I guess it's fine.
[28:22.450 --> 28:24.190]  Other than if you look at it, you go like,
[28:24.270 --> 28:26.270]  Oh my God, you have a giant birthmark right there.
[28:27.710 --> 28:29.490]  That birthed on you when you were 47.
[28:34.750 --> 28:37.570]  The time for spring cleaning is upon us.
[28:37.710 --> 28:40.350]  Do more than just dust your cabinets and organize your closet.
[28:40.590 --> 28:43.410]  Spring clean your butthole with Hello Tushy bidets.
[28:44.030 --> 28:47.190]  After wiping with dry, scratchy toilet paper all winter long,
[28:47.470 --> 28:49.730]  our bums could use a serious refresh.
[28:50.130 --> 28:54.110]  Put your cleanest booty forward and start washing with Hello Tushy.
[28:54.630 --> 28:56.470]  Hello Tushy is a fantastic product.
[28:56.670 --> 28:58.750]  It was so easy to install in my bathroom.
[28:59.370 --> 29:02.470]  It has made a huge difference to that overall experience.
[29:02.650 --> 29:03.190]  I love it.
[29:03.550 --> 29:04.770]  I would highly recommend it.
[29:05.150 --> 29:08.210]  So stop spreading your business around your butthole with toilet paper.

[30:05.850 --> 30:09.430]  Growing up, I had plenty of people in my family who went through the process
[30:09.430 --> 30:14.730]  of quitting cigarettes. And through my experiences and talking with them,
[30:14.810 --> 30:17.750]  I kind of have an understanding of what that process is like.
[30:18.630 --> 30:22.050]  So if you're a current smoker who's maybe going through the process of quitting,
[30:22.310 --> 30:27.710]  or somebody who has quit smoking but could be struggling with not going back to that addiction,
[30:28.330 --> 30:31.750]  I understand how difficult that is. And that's why you've got to check out Fume.
[30:32.530 --> 30:36.910]  Fume is the natural inhaler designed for a better, safer, and natural way to quit cigarettes.
[30:36.910 --> 30:42.310]  It's a no smoke, no vape, and no nicotine replacement for the hand-to-mouth habit of
[30:42.310 --> 30:48.790]  smoking. Fume handcrafts wooden inhalers and uses quartz infused with plain oil studied to curb
[30:48.790 --> 30:53.990]  cravings. They have flavors like Peppermint and Conquer with minty notes to simulate menthol
[30:53.990 --> 31:00.550]  cigarettes and other flavors like Cozy Chai and Lemon Berry Bliss for a sweeter experience.
[31:00.550 --> 31:07.150]  All of their flavors are 100% natural, no harmful chemicals, no artificial flavors,
[31:07.690 --> 31:12.550]  and absolutely no nicotine. Quitting is tough, but Fume really can help.
[31:12.890 --> 31:16.410]  They've got thousands of 5 star reviews from smokers who have tried everything else
[31:16.410 --> 31:21.110]  and this worked. Another thing I love about Fume is if you're somebody who flies all the time,
[31:21.530 --> 31:25.430]  being able to use Fume in the air and in the airport is a huge difference maker.
[31:25.890 --> 31:29.850]  Whether you're a smoker or ex-smoker who still struggles with cravings,

[31:53.850 --> 31:57.210]  There have been so many times in my life, especially growing up, where I've been
[31:57.210 --> 32:02.790]  trying to process something difficult emotionally or just even sometimes the day to day challenges
[32:02.790 --> 32:08.290]  we face as adults. It would be so much easier to navigate if there was a user manual for her,
[32:08.670 --> 32:13.030]  but unfortunately life doesn't come with a user manual, so when it's not working for you,
[32:13.150 --> 32:18.190]  it's normal to feel stuck. Navigating any of life's challenges can make you feel unsure,
[32:18.610 --> 32:21.970]  whether it's a career change, a new relationship, or becoming a parent.
[32:22.770 --> 32:25.610]  Therapists are trained to help you figure out the cause of challenging emotions
[32:25.610 --> 32:30.790]  and learn productive coping skills, which makes therapy the closest thing to a guided
[32:30.790 --> 32:36.810]  tour of the complex engine called you. BetterHelp has connected over 3 million people with licensed
[32:36.810 --> 32:42.690]  therapists. It's convenient and accessible anywhere. It's 100% online. It's amazing.
[32:43.390 --> 32:45.650]  Therapy has made a tremendous impact in my life.
[32:45.650 --> 32:49.670]  I'd talk about it every time with these just because it's true and resonates so much with me.
[32:51.390 --> 32:56.310]  Whether it was processing past trauma or just coming up with systems myself to go forward,
[32:57.790 --> 33:04.070]  therapy really showed me a path in those ways and has been so useful to me. So I would highly
[33:04.070 --> 33:09.470]  recommend it to anyone who is listening. And as the world's largest therapy service,
[33:09.650 --> 33:14.550]  BetterHelp has matched 3 million people with professionally licensed and vetted therapists

[33:44.890 --> 33:50.290]  I have a question for Andrew. Okay, what's up? I assume your ankles have been a
[33:50.290 --> 33:55.290]  100% for your allotted six weeks that you wanted, right? No.
[33:58.070 --> 33:59.090]  Moving on.
[34:01.370 --> 34:04.210]  No, they're not. What do you mean?
[34:04.210 --> 34:10.570]  No, I slept maybe an hour at a time last night because I was dealing with an ankle issue.
[34:11.350 --> 34:18.370]  It's terrible. I'm so tired. Your life is a constant cyclical loop. You have two months
[34:18.370 --> 34:24.150]  of ankles. You're back on. You break a chair. You get a new one. We're figuring out. I'm narrowing
[34:24.150 --> 34:28.110]  it down though. We're getting to the bottom of it. It's a whole thing. What do you mean?
[34:28.450 --> 34:33.290]  Getting to the bottom of what? He's narrowing it down to the ankle. I'm narrowing it down.
[34:33.290 --> 34:37.230]  I'm figuring out what the issues are. We're getting through it. I thought the issue was
[34:37.230 --> 34:42.190]  you have shitty ankles. Well, there's multiple issues. I have shitty ankles and then I have
[34:42.190 --> 34:45.270]  other things going on too, but I'm thinking we're getting through it. We're figuring it out.
[34:46.590 --> 34:54.130]  I stepped on a landmine essentially accidentally and the only way I wasn't in excruciating pain
[34:54.130 --> 34:59.770]  was if I had my foot flat, which is not easy to sleep, having your leg up and your foot flat.
[34:59.770 --> 35:05.510]  So I'd try to sleep, then it would hurt. Then I'd sit up and I'd try to sleep sitting up on my bed.
[35:05.610 --> 35:10.390]  That wouldn't really work. I'd get like maybe 20 minutes. Lay back down for 15 until it got bad.
[35:10.670 --> 35:17.910]  It was just up and down all night. Terrible pain. Okay. Follow up question. Did the percentage drop
[35:17.910 --> 35:24.530]  below a hundred due to something that happened in your own bedroom? No. Well, no, no. Okay.
[35:24.930 --> 35:28.910]  But we're getting there. We're figuring it out. Didn't get six weeks. Probably got like five.
[35:28.910 --> 35:34.990]  Five is not bad. So what percentage are you left at now? Right now, I'd say we're getting better.
[35:35.130 --> 35:39.890]  I'd say we're probably like 60. Are we doing damage or health? What is the rating?
[35:40.310 --> 35:44.790]  Just total health of the ankle, like the fallout. 40%. 40% right now.
[35:46.490 --> 35:50.230]  That's rough. You went from a hundred to 40% that fast, huh?
[35:50.870 --> 35:57.450]  Oh, yeah, it was bad. I would say that I was 20% for most of the evening, but we're back up to 40.
[35:57.450 --> 35:59.890]  We're climbing back up again. Nick says you need a Stimpak.
[36:00.110 --> 36:06.510]  I do need a Stimpak. I'd love a Stimpak. I will say I had a little bit of a fun moment
[36:06.510 --> 36:10.970]  where I brought an ice pack into bed because I've recently become a fan of the ice pack.
[36:11.090 --> 36:16.890]  I always rejected it. I didn't enjoy it. You're an ice pack guy now? I am now a big ice pack guy.
[36:17.050 --> 36:22.410]  Has to be the ones that aren't like ice, you know, like it's the gel. You need a gel one,
[36:22.410 --> 36:29.650]  not an ice one. Because my issue with the ice pack is they say apply it every 15 minutes on and
[36:29.650 --> 36:37.530]  off. Go 15, take like 30, go to 15 more. That fucking ice melts so quickly. It's awkward to
[36:37.530 --> 36:42.790]  put on places. It doesn't apply. It's just, it's terrible. But you get a gel pack and I have my
[36:42.790 --> 36:49.930]  little fridge in my room. Keeps it cold. We reset it. It's great. But I, last night, put the ice
[36:49.930 --> 36:54.610]  pack in the bed, then realized, ah, the place where I'm really sore, I don't think I could
[36:54.610 --> 37:01.290]  really, like naturally, in a way that wouldn't be excruciating, put that limb on that, in that area.
[37:01.970 --> 37:06.190]  But what do I do with this ice pack now? I just got an ice pack and I felt like I made the bed
[37:06.190 --> 37:10.410]  a little bit of a dangerous game. Because for whatever sleep I get, I roll around a little bit.
[37:10.630 --> 37:14.890]  I don't want to just randomly land on ice. That'd be a bad wake up. So I felt like I made the bed a
[37:14.890 --> 37:19.910]  little bit dangerous. It was kind of, it was fun. Spiced it up a little bit. Did you have any cold
[37:19.910 --> 37:26.470]  dreams? Didn't have any cold, I'd take any dreams at all. I didn't get no dreams. I was up and down
[37:26.470 --> 37:31.150]  too much. But yeah, we're, we're not, we're not six weeks. What were you going to ask if I was,
[37:31.190 --> 37:34.750]  what was the scenario and which was going to play out? Well, I was just going to ask you and then
[37:34.750 --> 37:37.370]  you were going to reply, I'm not doing it. I was going to ask you, uh, when are you doing the
[37:37.370 --> 37:45.690]  marathon? Uh, okay. Yeah, I'm not doing it. Still works. Still go there. Oh man. Do you think in
[37:45.690 --> 37:51.130]  your lifetime you will do the marathon? Yes. Okay. Do you think in the lifetime of this podcast,
[37:51.350 --> 37:56.270]  you will do the marathon? I certainly hope so. Well, as do we. Did the marathon come from
[37:56.270 --> 38:01.810]  burger confidence at the time? Like, is that why? Oh, the most ultimate, you seem to be thinking
[38:01.810 --> 38:06.490]  that it's one marathon. I committed to three in a week. It was the ultimate moment of burger
[38:06.490 --> 38:11.670]  confidence. I was laying down. I was like, you know, I could do three marathons in a week. I
[38:11.670 --> 38:16.510]  think I could just do this. I think I'd be good at this. We haven't done a decent bet in a while
[38:16.510 --> 38:23.070]  with you because they're so outrageous. Like the million gamerscore. We got some in the works.
[38:23.410 --> 38:29.910]  I don't, does anyone remember three marathons in a week? That's what it was. I committed,
[38:30.130 --> 38:36.990]  I committed to three, not one, three. We haven't even been able to get you close to doing one
[38:36.990 --> 38:42.650]  third of your challenge. Yeah, you guys keep talking about one, three. I said I'd do three.
[38:43.030 --> 38:48.350]  We'll settle for one. That's a new level of confidence. That's way higher than the 50
[38:48.350 --> 38:53.870]  burgers. Andrew, what if we split the difference and you only have to do like one and a half or
[38:54.330 --> 38:58.710]  two? Okay, well, do you want to know where it came from? There's a reason why I thought I
[38:58.710 --> 39:05.570]  could do this. I was watching some like random thing on that Eddie Izzard ran like 28 in 30
[39:05.570 --> 39:10.110]  days without training. And I was like, I could do three in a week. Eddie Izzard could do 28,
[39:10.630 --> 39:15.930]  30 days. Not a lot of prep. Easy. I got this. Then I stood up and my ankle, I was already
[39:15.930 --> 39:21.570]  dealing with ankle sores at the time. I made this declaration while in bed, got up, was a little
[39:21.570 --> 39:26.510]  sore. I thought I'd be fine. I'll bounce back soon. It's been an up and down road with the ankle
[39:26.510 --> 39:32.370]  since that moment. But yeah, it was. It's amazing how influential monkeys and Eddie Izzard are on
[39:32.370 --> 39:37.430]  your life. In what way? You learned how to skateboard from a monkey. Learned is a strong
[39:37.430 --> 39:43.930]  word. You've been inspired so much in your life, I feel like by, well, now Eddie Izzard,
[39:44.110 --> 39:48.890]  but monkeys. I'm an influenced man. Yeah. I thought I could ski because of James Bond.
[39:49.290 --> 39:54.210]  I've had many moments. Everybody has influences in their life. I have a billion. It's just
[39:54.210 --> 39:59.130]  interesting to see where yours come from. I had someone come up to me, Jack, super fan Jack,
[39:59.130 --> 40:04.170]  came up to me at work this week and just yelled, how did you let him get away with it?
[40:04.750 --> 40:10.570]  And I was like, what are you talking about? He's like, Andrew just pivoted the 500,000
[40:10.570 --> 40:16.850]  game of score bet into some golden I bet. And you were just like, okay. And I was thinking
[40:16.850 --> 40:21.990]  about it. I was like, oh. Because I was right. Because I was correct. That's why, that's why
[40:21.990 --> 40:26.450]  that happened. But you could, that's actually doable, the 500,000. I, but I think the golden,
[40:26.450 --> 40:29.410]  we went over this. We don't need to go over this again. I don't think it would be that
[40:29.410 --> 40:33.570]  interesting of content. I don't know how I'd make it into a thing. And it would just be me
[40:33.570 --> 40:37.210]  throwing money at it. You can make anything content. Yeah, but not on purpose. Just use
[40:37.210 --> 40:42.170]  Eric's credit card. No, it's not even a cost thing. It's just, it's not, there's no, I just
[40:42.170 --> 40:47.550]  throw money at it. I just do a money thing. That's not fun. I understand what Andrew's saying.
[40:47.850 --> 40:52.630]  Having done a gamer score bet in the past to great success that Andrew actually, you participated in
[40:52.630 --> 40:57.370]  now that I think about it. I think you helped me get some left for dead achievements in that
[40:57.370 --> 41:02.790]  gamer score bet I did. It is just a, it's just a money. It's, you really can't just solve that
[41:02.790 --> 41:06.350]  problem with money. He's right. It's, it doesn't feel like a real bet. Just because there's too
[41:06.350 --> 41:10.790]  many, just thousand points. There's so many. I had somebody message me a game that you could get
[41:10.790 --> 41:16.390]  like 20,000 points in, in five minutes. Oh. Like I was having people like read, that's why I was
[41:16.390 --> 41:21.750]  like, oh, that this isn't like, this seems really doable in a shitty way. And if I were, if I was
[41:21.750 --> 41:26.670]  going to do this, I just throw money at it. And they're not even that expensive. I mean, I remember
[41:26.670 --> 41:33.870]  that being your reason. I was just, I just miss you doing bets. I mean, I miss you. We just did
[41:33.870 --> 41:39.950]  the alpha bet. We just did. Did he though, Geoff? Did Andrew really do a bet? You know what? That's
[41:39.950 --> 41:45.570]  a good question. This, this seems like a great time. Was it hard for him to do pizza and pineapple
[41:45.570 --> 41:53.950]  and pancakes and potato patties? What's up? The most recent episode that released to the public
[41:53.950 --> 41:59.550]  as our discussion around the alpha bet, the results, the controversy around the evidence
[41:59.550 --> 42:05.390]  that I did not in fact rig the machine to give me a P. I don't know if other people claiming
[42:05.390 --> 42:11.190]  that I gave Geoff a U on purpose. There's no rigging at all, but this does seem like a good
[42:11.190 --> 42:18.010]  time to make a confession to that episode. Before you make the confession, I just want to say real
[42:18.010 --> 42:22.810]  fast. Eric pointed out that a marathon is 55,000 steps. I bet. What do you think you could do
[42:22.810 --> 42:29.530]  faster? Walk a marathon or write down a pencil? Write down a pencil. Okay. What do you think
[42:29.530 --> 42:36.710]  you could do better? Walk 55,000 steps or write 55,000 things? Write 55,000 things.
[42:38.490 --> 42:46.630]  Okay, now admit to cheating. Well, listen, cheating is a strong word. I'm an honorable man.
[42:47.130 --> 42:54.310]  That episode just came out. Since when? Since probably episode 22 of this show,
[42:54.370 --> 42:58.630]  whenever I became a judge. I don't know. You said that with a straight face, I bet.
[42:59.230 --> 43:03.730]  Oh, I always say with a straight face. It's the truth. It's the truth. I'm an honorable man.
[43:03.730 --> 43:12.310]  I'm an honorable... what was honorjudge.com? Free plug. I'm an honorable man. And someone in the
[43:12.310 --> 43:17.670]  comics, I posted a lot of evidence regarding a lot of things. And, you know, it seems very mixed.
[43:17.790 --> 43:24.350]  People, some people are on my side. Some people think I cheated it. This confession has absolutely
[43:24.350 --> 43:27.750]  nothing to do about that because I'm an honorable man. I didn't rig the machine at all. I'm an
[43:27.750 --> 43:31.930]  innocent man. I'm a free man. I did not do anything wrong. But there is a Reddit post
[43:31.930 --> 43:36.910]  that was fantastic. I need to own up to this. I don't even know what the consequences are,
[43:36.950 --> 43:43.170]  if there are any. But Reddit user Archery Contest posted... I don't remember the title of the post.
[43:44.210 --> 43:49.670]  Andrew has breached the agreement. It's the title. Opened it up. In that episode,
[43:50.490 --> 43:57.290]  I said all of my sports teams are trash. All of my teams are trash. Yes. It's an outlawed word.
[43:57.290 --> 44:02.710]  That is an outlawed word. I used the trash word. I have to use rubbish. I've lost the ability to
[44:02.710 --> 44:10.230]  say trash. We need to check the tapes. I do not know what the consequences of making such an error.
[44:10.550 --> 44:14.030]  I apologize. I hope the audience can forgive me. How many times do you think you've misused
[44:14.030 --> 44:21.930]  rubbish and trash? Oh, probably countless times. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna count this
[44:21.930 --> 44:27.970]  one. We're gonna call it your first strike. In language law, you get three strikes, and then
[44:27.970 --> 44:33.150]  it's a marathon. So you've got one strike. If you say trash two more times, you've got to walk a
[44:33.150 --> 44:37.270]  marathon. I like that. Okay. Deal. And how long does he have to complete the marathon after the
[44:37.270 --> 44:45.330]  final strike? Shut the fuck... Shut up. As long as it takes me to write 45,000... As long as it
[44:45.330 --> 44:51.290]  takes me to write rubbish 45,000 times with a pencil. Okay. I'll accept those terms.
[44:52.290 --> 44:59.770]  Write with pencil. A pencil write, right? Like, not digital. Yeah, with a pencil. Okay. I'm gonna
[44:59.770 --> 45:05.690]  write the 45,000 words. That sounds fair. When is the... Can I get one last one in without getting
[45:05.690 --> 45:14.830]  a strike? In like a grace period? Okay. That's rubbish. That sounds great. That sounds appropriate.
[45:15.450 --> 45:22.030]  Uh, that sounds like natural. Like, uh, hey, should... I wanted to deal with this at the
[45:22.030 --> 45:27.910]  top of the hour, but then I just realized we're fucking 45 minutes in somehow. I was
[45:27.910 --> 45:33.330]  gonna address this right out of the gate. But in a somber, serious note, I feel like we should
[45:33.330 --> 45:40.210]  talk about it because there have been, you know, it's public knowledge now that... And I'm gonna
[45:41.170 --> 45:47.970]  apologize now if I cry at all. I'm gonna try real hard not to. But in the most recent episode
[45:47.970 --> 45:52.690]  that came out of F*** Face 124, I mentioned that Henry had gone to the hospital and he was okay.
[45:53.910 --> 46:00.770]  Unfortunately, he died a couple days later. And he... I always considered Henry to be
[46:00.770 --> 46:06.390]  an official member of F*** Face. Definitely. I thought he brought a hell of a lot of joy
[46:07.030 --> 46:18.450]  to what we did. It was really sad. He didn't suffer. If there's such a thing as a good death,
[46:18.570 --> 46:25.870]  it was a really, really good death. He died in bed with us while we held him and he was happy.
[46:26.490 --> 46:33.730]  But he didn't squeak much for the last, I don't know, six months or so. And I just
[46:33.730 --> 46:38.290]  didn't talk about it. He just wasn't really able to play much anymore. He had some mobility issues.
[46:38.510 --> 46:45.650]  But I want the audience to know that until he died, Henry was still in the room every episode
[46:45.650 --> 46:51.330]  of F*** Face. He would crawl or walk in. He couldn't play. He couldn't make the noise that
[46:51.330 --> 46:55.590]  he used to. But he would come and he would sit next to me. And he knew every time I was recording
[46:55.590 --> 47:01.530]  F*** Face that it was time to go to work. And he, without fail until the end, he came and he sat
[47:01.530 --> 47:07.470]  here and he went through every episode of F*** Face with us. He may not have known he was there,
[47:07.570 --> 47:15.050]  but he was. And so Emily and I talked about a lot about like what to do about it on this. And
[47:15.050 --> 47:18.750]  I even, you know, we even joked around about maybe doing like a one last squeak for him.
[47:19.130 --> 47:24.110]  I kept Owl Owl and I kept, well, I've kept my favorite toys that he had. I kept Puss Puss and
[47:24.110 --> 47:29.490]  Owl Owl. And they're on the shelf next to me. But that seems silly and I don't want to do that.
[47:29.490 --> 47:33.670]  I do think it's pretty F*** Face-y that we are making a squeaky dog toy that he will never
[47:33.670 --> 47:38.030]  squeak. Because it's not it's not going to come in. It's not going to come in until well after
[47:38.030 --> 47:44.650]  his death. But a lot of people have sent well wishes to Emily and I and me. And I just wanted
[47:44.650 --> 47:48.770]  everybody to know that, like, Henry did pass away, but he he was five days short of 12,
[47:49.210 --> 47:55.830]  which is like 104 years old in bulldog terms. And so, you know, their life expectancy is like
[47:55.830 --> 48:02.050]  eight years. And so he made it 50 percent more than that. And so anyway, I don't want to bring
[48:02.050 --> 48:06.670]  the mood down too much. But but Henry did pass away last week. And so I thought people should
[48:06.670 --> 48:13.730]  know. So he made a solid 125 episodes of this. Yeah, he did. He made it 125 episodes. The first
[48:13.730 --> 48:19.550]  hundred and twenty five episodes of the Henry episodes. I'd love to know how many how much
[48:19.550 --> 48:25.210]  squeaking we have. If somebody compiled all the squeaks, how long of squeaks would we have?
[48:25.210 --> 48:29.510]  Like if you just edit off the beginning and the end of the squeak, like how long is this sustained?
[48:29.750 --> 48:35.190]  Do we have enough squeak to last what would be an episode length across the time? Because there
[48:35.190 --> 48:40.150]  were some great squeaks by Henry. He had some extended squeaks. I feel like we all got used
[48:40.150 --> 48:44.530]  to the squeaks. And there were rare occasion squeaks where we all just had to pause while
[48:44.530 --> 48:49.930]  he really squeaked it out. And you know what? We should make an album or something that's
[48:49.930 --> 48:55.870]  just the squeaks. Just the squeaks. Oh, that's so cute. I love that. Oh, you know, it'd be maybe
[48:55.870 --> 49:01.410]  be funny that too with for like I'm sure Nick could speak to this, but Henry squeaked a lot
[49:01.410 --> 49:05.410]  more than made it on air, because when you guys are talking and Henry's squeaking, I think Nick
[49:05.410 --> 49:09.650]  probably just flattens out my audio. So you can't you probably can't hear most of the actual squeaks
[49:09.650 --> 49:14.310]  that were going on. Yeah, I think you can only hear Henry when Geoff's talking, which is why half
[49:14.310 --> 49:17.930]  the time, especially in those early days when I wasn't following conversations and I'd be like,
[49:17.930 --> 49:22.630]  I'm honest. I tuned out because the squeaking was so goddamn loud. Sometimes I couldn't focus on
[49:22.630 --> 49:31.630]  both. I watched a cut of I think we all saw it today. Regulation animation. And it's the go go
[49:31.630 --> 49:38.050]  now story, which is it's it's animated so well. It's all really good. I turned it up really loud
[49:38.050 --> 49:42.830]  to show my wife. I'm like, oh, hey, watch this. It's pretty funny. The squeaking. I didn't realize
[49:42.830 --> 49:48.390]  how much squeaking there is in that story. Geoff, you're talking the whole time and it is
[49:49.390 --> 49:56.670]  constant in the background. It is so it is so loud and it's just being animated.
[49:57.430 --> 50:00.430]  And we're so used to it that like we'll show it to someone and they're like,
[50:00.470 --> 50:04.130]  what's the squeaking? Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.
[50:05.430 --> 50:10.710]  I like that he's transferred into another medium. Yeah, I'm glad that all the squeaks are captured.
[50:10.710 --> 50:14.930]  I want to know what our first reaction to the squeaks were. When was the first squeak?
[50:15.110 --> 50:20.830]  I've got a lot of questions about the lore of Henry. It is funny. It did it like it became a
[50:20.830 --> 50:25.750]  natural thing so quickly that, yeah, I can't remember when it began. It was yeah, it was
[50:25.750 --> 50:32.130]  sort of just always there. Mm hmm. Yeah. I remember finding out when you told us the names of the toys
[50:32.130 --> 50:41.090]  of Owl Owl and Puss Puss and then finding out was is Puss Puss an octopus? Yeah, of course.
[50:42.550 --> 50:49.150]  Of course. Of course, Puss Puss is an octopus. I would have assumed platypus. I would I mean,
[50:49.170 --> 50:54.130]  I see where you're going with octopus. I would be thinking platypus. Yeah, that's true. I don't
[50:54.130 --> 50:59.970]  associate that with cat as much, but you're not wrong. Now he's a little blue octopus. He's cutie.
[51:00.850 --> 51:07.530]  Yeah, he's looking at me right now, actually. Well, if people have any Henry fun facts that
[51:07.530 --> 51:14.010]  we've talked about, I'd love to see them. Yeah, he was a good guy. He he was a really good guy.
[51:14.570 --> 51:21.510]  He really he really took his job on face seriously. Like I would try to like on days when I wasn't
[51:21.510 --> 51:26.650]  feeling the squeaks, I would try to sneak away from him, you know, leave him asleep on the bed
[51:26.650 --> 51:31.710]  in the other side of the house, in the bedroom, and then shut the door, which doesn't lock or
[51:31.710 --> 51:36.130]  anything. It's just like saloon doors. So they just shut and then like try to be quiet and like
[51:36.550 --> 51:42.550]  clockwork that little motherfucker. We'd be like three minutes in and the doors go bam open and
[51:42.550 --> 51:47.810]  Henry would be here with like a fucking ball in his mouth ready to go. He witnessed the whole
[51:47.810 --> 51:51.970]  beanhole. He did. He was there for all of the beanhole, too. That's right. Yeah. He's watching
[51:51.970 --> 51:58.410]  over it. Oh, cutie. Anyway, so pizza soon. Yeah, we got it. We got to get on that pizza
[51:58.410 --> 52:03.910]  because Emily is getting ready to fucking. Is that the next face office day? Could it be pizza?
[52:05.170 --> 52:09.820]  Yeah, the next the next fuckface office day is next week. Which day?
[52:11.470 --> 52:16.410]  No, no. Wednesday. Why are you laughing? Did you already tell me?
[52:17.430 --> 52:21.270]  Because it's I've already said I sent the invite. I don't know how long ago,
[52:21.270 --> 52:24.670]  but it is Wednesday at 1 p.m. next week.
[52:25.350 --> 52:29.210]  Oh, no problem. Eric, I'm not going to I'm not I'm not going to count on that with anything.
[52:29.630 --> 52:35.590]  I'll see you at one o'clock on Wednesday. Uh huh. Uh huh. There is nothing scarier than
[52:35.590 --> 52:43.750]  hearing Gavin say what day. Uh huh. Did I miss the. You know, I won't even go there.
[52:44.110 --> 52:49.730]  Yeah. Where? Where is there? No, no, no, no, no, no. It's OK. Everything's OK. I'm
[52:49.730 --> 52:54.090]  the only place I'm going is Geoff's house on Wednesday.
[52:56.570 --> 53:02.510]  Could. Well, you're here, Eric. Where did the goose land? What? What? Second base?
[53:03.230 --> 53:09.830]  No, it was like it was in like shallow outfield. I don't remember. Yeah, it was like it was like
[53:09.830 --> 53:16.650]  between first and second base. Yeah. Closer to second base, maybe 15 feet, 30 feet behind
[53:16.650 --> 53:21.930]  second second base. Yeah. So I don't I don't watch a lot of baseball. I did watch the Mets
[53:21.930 --> 53:29.370]  Padres series, and there was a fantastic scandal during, I think, game three. Yes. Yeah. Correct.
[53:29.510 --> 53:36.030]  Yeah. Late in game three, there was an accusation that the pitcher had vaseline his ears,
[53:36.070 --> 53:40.330]  I'm assuming was the substance that that they thought they were accusing. And then there were
[53:40.330 --> 53:44.250]  all these close ups. I was this is this something that happens regularly in baseball because it was
[53:44.250 --> 53:50.170]  a great moment. They were zooming in on his ears and how glistening they were. And there were all
[53:50.170 --> 53:54.370]  these talks about like, well, what's going on with the ears is going on. Then he like kind of rubbed
[53:54.370 --> 53:57.610]  his ears and felt like, oh, is he trying to hide something? What's going on with these ears?
[53:57.710 --> 54:01.770]  And then like all of the officiating crew got together, which is like five or six guys
[54:01.770 --> 54:06.730]  all talking about this other man's ears. And then they talked to the team about it.
[54:06.950 --> 54:12.010]  And then eventually they rubbed down his ears to check if there is it was a ridiculous scene.
[54:12.010 --> 54:18.330]  So I was just curious if maybe Padres upping their game brought Vaseline via the Goosen.
[54:18.510 --> 54:23.830]  No, as a possibility. That's a great idea to have some kind of goose delivery mechanism to your
[54:23.830 --> 54:29.170]  pitcher so you can cheat like nobody would see a big goose handing something to your pitcher.
[54:29.470 --> 54:32.910]  Yeah. Maybe it was actually goose fat. And that was like a hint to it.
[54:33.050 --> 54:39.890]  Could it could have been. I think it was icy hot to keep them uncomfortable and focused,
[54:39.890 --> 54:46.850]  but they checked him in the sixth inning, but the manager for the Mets was suspicious from the very
[54:46.850 --> 54:52.650]  first pitch. So he waited for his team to be losing for six innings to go. Something's wrong.
[54:52.970 --> 54:58.010]  I got to be honest. I watched that entire game, too. And I was up at Emily's families in Michigan.
[54:58.350 --> 55:01.910]  And from the first inning, I was on the couch going to Emily going,
[55:02.250 --> 55:04.390]  what is wrong with his fucking ears? They're glowing.
[55:04.930 --> 55:08.770]  They are absolute. The rest of his body is dry and his ears are dripping.
[55:09.450 --> 55:13.050]  It is so weird. And so then when they they approached him on the sixth inning and I was
[55:13.050 --> 55:16.150]  like, oh, shit, I guess at least I'm not the only one that thinks these years things are
[55:16.150 --> 55:20.190]  the ear thing is weird. However, even if it was Vaseline, that doesn't help a pitcher.
[55:20.290 --> 55:24.210]  Pitchers want sticky shit. They want to scuff up a ball. They want to smooth it out.
[55:24.530 --> 55:27.910]  Yes. Supposedly it is. It is icy hot, like Eric was saying.
[55:28.490 --> 55:32.190]  And I guess a lot of pitchers do that because it keeps them alert and uncomfortable.
[55:32.390 --> 55:35.390]  And so they're like always focused. And they're like, did you hear about
[55:35.390 --> 55:38.490]  Roger Clemens in Tokyo? No, no.
[55:39.010 --> 55:43.190]  He got he wasn't feeling it like it was like an opening to a season or whatever,
[55:43.190 --> 55:47.390]  and he wasn't really feeling it. And they they had sent these teams to Tokyo to kind of like
[55:47.390 --> 55:52.410]  get ready and play and everything. And Jake Peavy, a Padres pitcher, was talking about going with him.
[55:52.630 --> 56:00.690]  And Roger Clemens was there and got a full body massage in icy hot, his whole body, his entire
[56:00.690 --> 56:08.970]  body in icy hot to like wake him up and get him uncomfortable. And then told Jake Peavy,
[56:09.710 --> 56:13.230]  when I'm on the mound, I don't like being comfortable because when you're comfortable,
[56:13.250 --> 56:18.370]  you make mistakes. Took a handful of icy hot and rubbed it on his dick and balls.
[56:22.790 --> 56:26.990]  So there's a rich tradition of this in Major League Baseball.
[56:27.250 --> 56:30.410]  Baseball players are weird, but we're all happy about the goose, at least.
[56:30.690 --> 56:36.630]  Oh, my God. Before the next recording. Oh, my God. Icy hot, icy hot balls, dude. I see
[56:36.630 --> 56:39.850]  hot in my balls and achievement hunter that day. And it was brutal. I don't want to do that again.
[56:40.530 --> 56:44.630]  But I will. I'm comfortable enough to make a really good episode. No, I got a great idea.
[56:44.750 --> 56:50.250]  Why don't we all pick a series of numbers and then I will pull one from the machine and whoever
[56:50.250 --> 56:57.550]  gets pulled has to do it. Let's put icy hot. I can see no issues with this. Yeah, this is
[56:57.550 --> 57:02.610]  a random system in which no way could be influenced or messed with because I am an
[57:02.610 --> 57:11.670]  honorable man. You're going to have a 4K streaming webcam live or we could just all do it. I'm also
[57:11.670 --> 57:17.230]  open to that. It just this all happened because you didn't put on pants like you understand that,
[57:17.310 --> 57:21.890]  right? No. Yeah. No, you're right. You're not wrong about that. Well, it was if it was a one
[57:21.890 --> 57:26.390]  in four chance, Eric, of your name being pulled, would you go in on it for the icy hot cock?
[57:26.870 --> 57:31.270]  No, I don't think I would because I don't trust it. I mean, there's no way if he was rigging it
[57:31.270 --> 57:37.930]  that he would pick you. I just don't trust that it would. I think it's all or nothing. I think
[57:37.930 --> 57:45.150]  the idea is that being agitated will make us operate at a higher level of play. I like this
[57:45.150 --> 57:50.370]  idea. Let's do it. So it's like all or nothing. I will say live the life of a pitcher. Supposedly
[57:50.370 --> 57:55.610]  that pitcher whose name escapes me, he was throwing a solid two miles an hour faster than his fastest
[57:55.610 --> 58:02.550]  pitch and two miles an hour faster than his average average. And supposedly what is it?
[58:02.610 --> 58:06.630]  What do they measure, like RPMs or something on pitch? Yeah. Yeah. Revolutions per minute,
[58:07.030 --> 58:12.870]  spin rate and stuff. And they were going spin rate was off the charts. But but it was all just
[58:12.870 --> 58:17.330]  above his average. Do you know how an average is formed? No, no, I understand that. I understand
[58:17.330 --> 58:21.050]  that. I'm just saying I'm not saying the guy cheated. I'm saying there were clear benefits
[58:21.050 --> 58:26.110]  to using Icy Hot. Yeah, he's he's fine. And you can use Icy Hot. It is not a banned substance
[58:26.110 --> 58:30.850]  for a pitcher. So put it all over your dick and balls and go crazy. Maybe if we Icy Hot our
[58:30.850 --> 58:36.110]  dick and balls, our jokes per minute will go up. That's what I'm saying. Do you do you think that
[58:36.110 --> 58:42.290]  if you put Icy Hot on your dick and balls, you can throw 80 miles an hour? No. No, but maybe I
[58:42.290 --> 58:47.590]  could tell 80 jokes an hour. I don't know. Are we doing that? We locked in next episode, next
[58:47.590 --> 58:54.070]  recording. I'm in. I'm in. Are you going to do it too? Elite performance. He's got to do it. He's
[58:54.070 --> 59:01.510]  Nick. Nick, are you going to do it? Thank God I don't talk. I mean, if we're going to do it,
[59:01.530 --> 59:05.490]  we can do it. It's just going to be OK. Let's do it. Oh, Nick says I'll do it if you do.
[59:06.570 --> 59:11.650]  Oh, my God. Oh, OK. There we go. Oh, shit. All right. Episode 127. It's going to be
[59:12.430 --> 59:18.910]  Icy Hot. Yeah, we're going to operate above our average. And we always do. Am I coming in hot?
[59:19.270 --> 59:24.530]  No, I think we should apply during the... OK. Oh, I agree. I think at the top of the episode,
[59:24.690 --> 59:30.730]  we apply and then... That sounds good. We'll have like an... How do we... Here's... OK.
[59:31.210 --> 59:37.710]  I have questions about this then. OK. How do we keep each other honest?
[59:38.610 --> 59:45.390]  A 4K webcam. It has... No! On to what? A 4K webcam on to what?
[59:46.790 --> 59:54.530]  Dude, I shoved an icicle up my ass during an episode. Like, this is not outside of the realm
[59:54.530 --> 59:58.290]  of things you should be able to believe I would do. I've done it on camera in Achievement Hunter.
[59:58.410 --> 01:00:02.370]  Gavin was there. Like, you don't have to worry about me. Yeah. And there's no point in faking
[01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:07.730]  something like that. No. I agree. I want to be part of this experience. I think we'll keep
[01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:15.650]  ourselves honest. Yeah. OK. OK. I just... Here's what I'll say. If anybody here fakes it and isn't...
[01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:21.290]  it doesn't go all in, they're just going to have to live with that knowledge for the rest of their
[01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.510]  lives, knowing they didn't fully share in the experience. Yeah. And it's definitely not a
[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:29.670]  f*** face move if you don't do it. Yeah. It's also going to be noticeable because they're going to be
[01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:33.490]  way less funny than everybody else. We're all going to be on the top of our game. We're going to
[01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:38.570]  be on fire. Everyone else is going to be engaged and locked in. If you're not part of that, you're
[01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:44.330]  gonna get left in the dust. So we're promising episode 127 is going to be the funniest episode
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:50.930]  of this. I guess. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Or we're confirming that it does nothing. The Icy Hot
[01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:55.870]  doesn't work. We're taking this into the lab. Here's what we can do. Research. Here's what we
[01:00:55.870 --> 01:01:04.230]  can do. Oh, Jesus Christ. If it's going poorly and it doesn't feel like the funniest episode. No.
[01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:12.630]  There is a story I told you guys about three weeks ago, a between episodes f*** face that I did to
[01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:21.530]  myself that I thought was too gross to tell on camera. Yes. And I think Gavin agreed. No, Eric
[01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:27.330]  agreed. Gavin disagreed. And I don't remember where Gavin and I both agreed that it was appropriate
[01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:31.950]  for that it worked. And Eric, I think let's not be let's not get it wrong. It's a horrendous story,
[01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:38.330]  but it is disgusting and gross. And Eric was Eric was fully against it. But I recommend it. Maybe
[01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:42.270]  we just save that for a live event. OK, well, I'm just going to say if things are going badly,
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:46.710]  I can break the glass and pull that story out and try in some way to tell it. That doesn't
[01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:50.230]  make me seem like a monster. I would also like to point out that there were a few people,
[01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:54.990]  a few comment leavers who thought it was too far when we all Winnie the Poohed it and hung
[01:01:54.990 --> 01:02:00.350]  our genitals out for about a minute. So if you felt that way, you're not going to enjoy next week.
[01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:06.990]  No, no. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Give it a miss. Am I doing a patch? Am I going with the foam?
[01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:13.670]  What roll on or whatever? I have all that. I assumed I would lather up the hands in the cream.
[01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:18.770]  Yeah, I'm going to just go to town. Yeah, I don't think I want to patch that area. Yeah,
[01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:24.530]  I would not patch it. That could be bad. I would I would either get the roll on,
[01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.290]  which seems like a lot. Just get the cream. The cream makes sense. Just get the cream.
[01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:33.370]  I'm just I'm on DoorDash right now. I'm just looking to see what options I have if I wanted.
[01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:37.790]  Can you leave a note and make sure they know it's for your balls so you can make the funniest
[01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:46.850]  episode of a podcast? Oh, and do we care about brand? Like, I have I have Tiger Balm. I was
[01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:50.610]  going to use Tiger Balm. I think it's stronger than Icy Hot anyway. But if you need me to get
[01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:55.650]  Icy Hot brand Icy Hot, I can't. I don't I don't think I should have a consistent. I have Tiger
[01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.130]  Balm Ultra already here because I fucking all basic. You you want to put something called
[01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:05.890]  Tiger Balm Ultra on? Yeah. Yeah, it'll be it'll be way worse, I think, than Icy Hot.
[01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:09.970]  I feel like we're all about to start doping before the next game. That's how much.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:15.450]  Yeah. Yeah, I could get the ointment Ultra Strength. It's got a tiger on it because it's
[01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:19.310]  Tiger Balm. All right, we'll get the same stuff. Tiger Balm, serious, serious deal.
[01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:24.530]  Tiger Balm? I guess we're getting Tiger Balm. Does this clear legal, by the way?
[01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:29.750]  Yeah, yeah, legal. Yeah. I just asked. Legal said it's fine. They also don't know we exist,
[01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:35.430]  so it's OK. Oh, great. Yeah. I think the only other thing to discuss before we before we go
[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:43.850]  is are the banana wipes done? No, no, absolutely not. I still got time. I got everything organized.
[01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:50.250]  It's all ready to go. What percentage done is it? Yeah. What percentage did I see last time?
[01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.570]  Does anyone remember what I said last time? I forget that question. Andrew, have you touched
[01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:59.030]  it since the last time we talked? Like physically touched or like I've done some mental work. I've
[01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:04.730]  done some I've thought about some transitions. It's all up here. Yeah, it's all up here. It's
[01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:09.910]  all up there. I actually I need to reach out to somebody on Facebook. I'm getting the sense that
[01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:15.190]  should probably end because we're over an hour. But I do. I also had a piece of news that I
[01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:20.810]  thought I would talk about today, but we had such a lovely conversation. But I did. I did. I did a
[01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:29.450]  thing in Michigan and I kind of fuck. I did it. So it was it was definitely a face in a lot of ways.
[01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.990]  But I don't know if you guys want to cover it next week or if you want to. I could bang out
[01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:38.410]  the story now, but I did propose to my girlfriend and she did eventually say yes.
[01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:45.830]  Eventually. Well, thanks. It was, you know, I faced it. Let's just say.
[01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.810]  Are we doing with the teaser? This is a teaser.
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:54.870]  OK, well, I just say, like, yeah, I kind of I kind of fucked up the proposal, but in a very
[01:04:54.870 --> 01:05:01.330]  mean way. And I'll tell you this, too. I didn't. I'm going to send you let me send you two photos
[01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:06.830]  real fast. My friend Kent pointed this out to me. The place where I proposed completely
[01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:11.510]  unintentionally. And I didn't realize it until I saw the photos kind of horrified me, actually.
[01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:16.370]  Let me find them. I'm sorry. I'm vamping while I try to find these photos.
[01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:23.430]  You might recognize it, Gavin, especially. Well, I guess, Andrew, you would, too.
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:31.330]  This is where I proposed because I thought it would be really romantic.
[01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:43.130]  And it's this place in Mackinac Island called Arch Rock. Wow. OK. And my friend Kent pointed out to me that this is actually where I proposed.
[01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:56.410]  I what I posted is a picture of this place called Arch Rock in in Michigan where I proposed. And
[01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:03.790]  under it is a screenshot from Randall Glass's Warthog Jump video, which is the honestly the
[01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:08.110]  inspiration for Rooster Teeth in our career, probably, is that we we watched that video, Gus
[01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:13.770]  and I, and we got really excited about Halo physics. I proposed to my girlfriend in like the
[01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:18.890]  real life representation of a level of Halo 1 in Silent Cartographer. That was not intentional.
[01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:22.690]  That was like that time I bought a bicycle and then Gavin pointed out that it was the Achievement
[01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:29.810]  100. That video was so iconic that I remember the first thing I thought when I saw that video is
[01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:36.910]  how am I watching a video of like an Xbox? Like it was that early. How do you record an Xbox and
[01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:41.770]  put it on the Internet? How does that work? It's still a phenomenal video if you ever get a chance
[01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:45.070]  to see it. He does a bit where he blows up the Warthog. It goes really high in the air and then
[01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:49.230]  he shoots a rocket predictively into it. I thought it was the coolest shit when I was like 13.
[01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.670]  Oh yeah, Gus and I would just spend Friday nights just in the living room trying to recreate
[01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:59.170]  everything he did. And that's how we learned how to get like the tank on the base and all that dumb
[01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:04.970]  physics stuff we did in Rooster Teeth in early days of Red vs. Blue. It all came from Randall's
[01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:10.050]  video. He was in Season 1. Yeah, he actually was the original, not to get off on a Rooster Teeth
[01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:14.810]  tangent, but we liked it so much we became friendly with him because it was so kind of
[01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:20.150]  inspirational and informative that he was the original character or voice actor for the character
[01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:26.190]  Vic in Rooster Teeth. I keep saying Rooster Teeth. In Red vs. Blue. And then I think
[01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:34.330]  Bernie didn't have enough voices and so he took that one. Bernie needed to voice yet another
[01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:38.910]  character so he took a little bit in Season 2. When was the last time you spoke to Randall Glass?
[01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:42.630]  Oh, it's probably been a decade. How about you? Never.
[01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:48.750]  Oh really? He's a nice dude. I mean, he was. I assume he still is. But yeah, I probably haven't
[01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:52.870]  talked to him in a decade. I did talk to Bernie the other day though. Still talk to him. Anyway,
[01:07:53.110 --> 01:08:00.130]  we should probably wrap up. Be sure to tune in next week for what promises to be the funniest
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:07.770]  episode in the history of F*** Face. Yeah, it's gonna be so bad. Should we stop posting that on
[01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:20.370]  socials as if it's real? Like it's an event. Dude, the ears, they don't look real. Eric just
[01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:25.050]  posted a picture of the ears. They look like wax ears. Those are not standard ears.
[01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:35.730]  Bye! Hey guys, MajorLeagueFan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:39.990]  Geoff has even more mouth problems. How would you make a waffle at your desk?
[01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:44.910]  Pantin is at it again. Seriously, what is wrong with Geoff's mouth? And once again,
[01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:49.370]  Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
